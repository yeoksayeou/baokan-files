The First Jointly-Managed Business
Introducing the Jointly-Managed Sanxincheng Glass Store
By our reporter, Jin Yu

The Jointly-Managed Sanxincheng Glass Store is formed by two businesses (Sanxincheng, Tongtaiyi) and two craftsmen (Bian Xin’san, Jia Changfa). It is the first jointly-managed business to appear in Beijing.

Sanxincheng and Tongtaiyi Glass Stores both have a history of more than ten years. Under the continuous plunder and exploitation by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionary regime, they had reached the end of their rope before the liberation of Beijing. Sanxincheng lost half of its goods during Chiang Kai-shek's "currency reform." Later, the remnants of the bandits built an airport in Dongdan, where the store was located, and business almost completely stopped. After the liberation of Beijing, although they undertook some sporadic installation business, they still could not maintain it due to lack of funds and manpower. At that time, they were borrowing a few pieces of glass from their counterparts. Whenever the manager Zhou Fengqi went out to work, the inner manager took care of the house with her children.

Tongtaiyi once engaged in the oil and vinegar business because the glass business was not good. The store was located in a remote area and did not know how to manage, so it lost all the capital of 300 jin of sesame oil it had borrowed. What to do? The manager of Tongtaiyi said: "The business will be reported for closure, I will apply for a job in a department store, and the apprentice will be sent home."

Bian Xin’san and Jia Changfa are both craftsmen. Bian Xin’san worked in Siyou Glass Store and earned very little each month. Jia Changfa had glass installation technology and some small capital, so he took on work alone. He felt very inconvenient without a storefront, but he could not start a storefront on his own.

Before the joint management, the most difficult were Sanxincheng and Tongtaiyi. Zhou Fengqi, the manager of Sanxincheng, said: "I know I can't do it anymore. There are two roads in front of me: one is to close down; the other is to join the public sector or find someone to cooperate." He chose the second path.

At that time, several industrial joint management organizations appeared in Beijing one after another, which was a great inspiration to Zhou Fengqi. He learned the joint management method of the "Beijing Soap Joint Management Cooperative," and also referred to the articles of association of the production cooperative, combining with Yin Zhiren (manager of Tongtaiyi) and fellow craftsmen Bian Xin’san and Jia Changfa, to formally prepare for joint management.

In mid-March of this year, the prototype of joint management was formed. They first signed a joint management contract, in which the four people shared the joint management capital of 6,200 jin of millet (converted to 40 boxes of glass at the then rice price); rented Sanxincheng's storefront and equipment; and used Sanxincheng's name, but added the words "joint management" to show the difference.

The four people divided the work, stipulated the amount of wages each person should receive each month, the settlement period, and the profit and loss handling methods.

After the joint management organization was sound, they replenished a large number of glass and some necessary equipment. The Jointly-Managed Sanxincheng officially started business on April 1st.

When the reporter asked about the business situation of their first month of joint management, Zhou Fengqi opened the ledger and moved the abacus, saying: "The total turnover for the whole month was 13,686,100 yuan, equivalent to 70 boxes of glass." Before the joint management, the total monthly turnover of their three companies (Sanxincheng, Tongtaiyi, Jia Changfa) was only 10 boxes of glass; the increase was six times compared to before. Zhou Fengqi compared their situation before and after the joint management, saying: "Before it was 'mountains and rivers exhausted, doubting there is no road', today it is 'the willows are dark, the flowers are bright, and another village appears'."

How did the business of Jointly-Managed Sanxincheng develop? Based on their conversation, there are several reasons:

First, it is the concentrated use of manpower and capital. Before the joint management, some of them worked alone; some could not take care of both the counter and the outside due to lack of manpower; and because of the small amount of capital, they did not dare to take on large orders. After the joint management, they concentrated four people who knew both technology and management, and added two more partners. When business was busy, even with apprentices, they could dispatch seven people at once.

They now only have the capital of 40 boxes of glass, which is not enough according to the current business situation. But compared to the previous decentralized use, it is already much better. Due to the concentrated use of manpower and capital, the number of departments they interact with has increased; and they dare to boldly take on work. According to Zhou Fengqi, they now have dealings with eight construction factories, and many schools, institutions, and residents. The installation projects recently undertaken for the Ministry of Public Security, Xinsheng Middle School, and other units are large orders of 20 boxes of glass.

Second, price stability is also a favorable condition for their operation. After prices began to stabilize in March of this year, the false prosperity of some industries and businesses disappeared. Some industrial and commercial households have a misconception that after prices stabilize, business becomes more difficult. In fact, price stability is a favorable condition for the development of industry and commerce, and the situation of the Jointly-Managed Sanxincheng is a powerful proof. Zhou Fengqi and Yin Zhiren are both businessmen who have been in business for more than ten years, and they truly experienced the benefits of price stability for commercial operations today. They said: "We don't have to worry about rising prices all day long now, and we dare to take orders first and then collect payment. We can take large orders and purchase goods according to our needs. We have eliminated the worry of 'selling out and not being able to buy back'."

They also said: "After prices are stable, bank interest rates have decreased. If we encounter insufficient capital turnover, we can borrow some money from the bank, and the interest we bear is very limited. In the past, they did not dare to ask about it."

Some of the new commercial management methods used by the Jointly-Managed Sanxincheng are worth learning from the conservative commercial capitalists.

They adopted the principle of small profits and quick turnover. According to Zhou Fengqi: "We now look at profits of half a percentage to one percentage (5% to 10%), and sometimes it can be even lower. It was not possible in the past. With less business and high expenses, we did not dare to take on business if it was too hard." At that time, their profit margin was about 30%.

The second is to save expenses. At present, they can achieve the following aspects: The first is to eradicate the accumulated habits of entertainment in commercial operations. They all abide by the covenant, and no one is allowed to have entertainment expenses. The second is that the staple food is mainly coarse grains, and all partners are treated equally. The third is that personal affairs are not allowed to use the funds of the counter. Yin Zhiren cited a recent example: At the end of May, Zhou Fengqi went to Tianjin for personal matters, and although there was cash in the counter, he borrowed 100,000 yuan from a friend himself.

In addition, they also have regulations on holding regular meetings, taking vacations in turn, and financial transparency. Harmonious labor-capital relations - the owner can take care of the welfare of the partners, and the partners can work diligently - is also a characteristic of them.

　　联营商号第一家
    介绍联营三信成玻璃庄
    本报记者  近宇
    联营三信成玻璃庄是由两家商号（三信成、同泰益），和两个手艺人（边鑫三、贾长发）共同组成的，它是北京出现的第一个联营商号。
    三信成和同泰益两家玻璃庄，都有了十余年的历史。在日寇、国民党反动政权连年掠夺、压榨下，到北京解放以前，它们已经是山穷水尽了。三信成在蒋匪“改革币制”期间，损失了一半货物。后来残匪在东单修建飞机场，该号地处东单，营业几乎全部停顿。北京解放以后，虽然承做了一些零星的按装生意，但因缺乏资金人力，仍不能维持。当时是用几块玻璃向同业拆借几块。每逢经理周凤岐外出做活时，就由内掌柜带着孩子看家。
    同泰益曾因玻璃生意不好兼营油、醋业。该号地址偏僻，又不会经营，把借来的三百斤香油的本钱也赔完了。怎样办呢？同泰益经理说：买卖报了歇业，自己投考百货公司做事，徒弟打发回家。
    边鑫三和贾长发都是手艺人。边鑫三在四友玻璃庄做事，每月收入很少。贾长发有按装玻璃技术，又有一些小资本，自己单独应活做。他十分感到没有门面的不方便，但凭自己的力量，无法搞起一个门面来。
    在联营之前，最困难的是三信成和同泰益。三信成的经理周凤岐说：“我知道自己是不能干了，摆在面前的有两条路：一条是关门歇业；另一条是投奔公家或是找人合作。”他选择了第二条道路。
    当时，北京相继出现了几家工业联营机构，对于周凤岐是个很大的启示。他学会了“北京肥皂联营社”的联营方法，又参考生产合作社的组织章程，结合志同道合的殷志然（同泰益经理）和同业边鑫三、贾长发三个人，正式筹备联营。
    今年三月中旬，联营的雏型具备了。他们首先订定了联营合同，由四个人分担联营的资本小米六千二百斤（以当时米价折合玻璃四十箱）；租用三信成的门面房子、设备；沿用三信成的字号，但加上“联合经营”字样，以示区别。
    四个人进行了分工，规定了每人每月应支的工资额及结算期限、盈亏处理办法等。
    在联营机构健全以后，他们补进大批的玻璃和一些必要的器材。联营三信成在四月一日正式开始营业。
    当记者问到他们联营后第一个月的营业状况时，周凤岐翻开账本，拨动着算盘说：“全月流水共一千三百六十八万六千一百元，合七十箱玻璃。”在联营之前，他们三家（三信成、同泰益、贾长发）每月营业额总共不过十箱玻璃；前后比较增加了六倍。周凤岐把他们联营前后做比较说：“以前是‘山穷水尽疑无路’，今天是‘柳暗花明又一村’。”
    联营三信成的营业是怎样发展起来的呢？综合他们的谈话，有以下几个原因。
    第一、是人力、资金的集中使用。在联营之前，他们有的是匹马单枪作活；有的因人手少，顾到柜上顾不到外头；加上资金小，不敢应大宗活。联营后，他们集中了四个既会技术又懂经营的人，又增加了两个伙友，遇到买卖忙时，连徒弟算上，一下可以出动七个人。
    他们现在只有四十箱玻璃的资金，按目前的营业状况来说，这是不够的。但比起以前分散使用，已经是好多了。由于人力和资金的集中使用，他们交往的部门增多了；也敢大胆应活了。据周凤岐说：现在和他们有来往的有八个营造厂，和许多学校、机关及住户。最近承做的公安部、新生中学等单位的按装工程，都是二十箱玻璃的大宗活。
    第二、物价稳定也是他们经营的有利条件。在今年三月物价开始稳定后，若干工商业虚假的繁荣消逝了。有些工商业户产生了一种错觉，即认为物价稳定后，生意反倒不好做了。其实，物价稳定正是工商业发展的有利条件，联营三信成的情况，是个有力的证明。周凤岐、殷志然都是做过十几年买卖的商人，他们今天真正体验到物价平稳对商业经营的好处。他们说：我们现在不必整天担心物价上涨，敢先应买卖，后收款。我们可以大宗应活，根据需要进货。我们已经消除了“卖出去，买不回来”的顾虑。
    他们还说：物价平稳以后，银行利息降低了，遇到资金不够周转，可以向银行借点款子，所负利息很有限。在以前，他们是不敢问津的。
    联营三信成应用的一些新的商业经营方法，是值得守旧的商业资本家们学习的。
    他们采用了薄利多销的经营方针。据周凤岐说：“我们现在看利半成到一成（百分之五至百分之十），有时还可以再低些。在以前可不行，生意少，挑费大，买卖太苦了就不敢应。”那时他们的利润率是百分之三十左右。
    其次是节省开支。目前他们能做到的有以下几方面：第一是革除了商业经营中的应酬积习。他们都遵守公约，谁也不许有应酬费的开支。第二是伙食以粗粮为主，东伙一律。第三是个人私事不准动用柜上资金。殷志然举了一个最近的例子：五月底周凤岐到天津办私事，柜上虽有现款，但他自己却向朋友借了十万元。
    此外，他们还有定期开会，轮流休假和财务公开的规定。和谐的劳资关系——东家能照顾伙计的福利、伙计能勤快的做活，也是他们的一个特点。
