　　Qi Zhenhai, Director of the Wan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Dismissed for Wasting State Assets

　　Qi Zhenhai, the director of the Wan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province, has been irresponsible in his work and engaged in personal favoritism towards cadres since he took office as the director of the cooperative in 1948, resulting in losses of state assets. The cooperative has not been able to clear its accounts since 1948. The staff's mess expenses are mixed up with the cooperative's accounts. Recently, when the county sent people to inspect, the accounts showed a surplus of 750.68 *dou* of wheat, 14.5 *dou* of rice, 157.23 *dou* of millet, 19.4 *jin* of cooked cotton, and 9,000 *jin* of coal. There was a shortage of 15,921 *jin* of salt, 2,775 *jin* of sesame cake, 500 *jin* of seed cotton, 51 *jin* of red and white sugar, 30 *jin* of pepper, 72 *dou* of small beans, 26 bolts of homespun cloth, as well as paper, leather coats, soybeans, and other items. The cooperative's accountant, Peng Fei, ran away privately and his whereabouts are still unknown.

　　In addition, the cooperative had two fires, burning more than 300 *jin* of cotton. There were two thefts, resulting in the loss of eight and a half bolts of foreign cloth. After these incidents occurred, Qi Zhenhai still did not improve his work properly. He also used personal connections to lend 651.15 *jin* of rice to Chen Jinbang, the director of the Fourth Branch (calculated as rice based on the price at the time; the same applies below), 104 *jin* to Zhou Zhenrong, 491 *jin* to Cao Junfeng, 90 *jin* to Men Jihan, 105 *jin* to An Guojun, 126 *jin* to Wang Tongyi, and 99 *jin* to Li Pengxiang.

　　In terms of business, the cooperative did not supply the needs of the masses or regulate materials according to the principles of supply and marketing. Instead, it aimed solely for profit, hoarding goods, buying cheap, and selling dear. This caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Based on the above situation, the Wan County government, with the approval of the special commissioner's office, gave Qi Zhenhai the punishment of dismissal.

　　完县供销社主任齐振海浪费国家资财被撤职
    河北完县供销社主任齐振海，自一九四八年任该社主任以来，对工作不负责任，对干部进行私人拉拢，造成国家资财的损失。该社自一九四八年以来，账目迄未算清。工作人员伙食账与社账混合不清。最近县里派人检查，在账目中多出小麦七五○·六八斗，大米一四·五斗，小米一五七·二三斗，熟花一九·四斤，石炭九、○○○斤；缺少食盐一五九二一斤，胡麻饼二七七五斤，籽棉五○○斤，红白糖五一斤，胡椒三○斤，小豆七二斗，土布二六匹，还有纸张、皮大衣、黄豆等。该社会计鹏飞私自逃跑，至今不知下落。
    此外，该社曾失火两次，烧毁棉花三○○多斤。发生偷盗两次，被偷去洋布八匹半。这些事件发生后，齐振海仍不好好改进工作，又以私人关系，借给四分社主任陈金榜米六五一·一五斤（按当时款折成米，以下均同。）借给周振荣一○四斤，曹俊峰四九一斤，门继汉九○斤，安国俊一○五斤，王仝义一二六斤，李鹏祥九九斤。
    该社在业务方面，不是按供销原则供给群众的需要、调剂物资。而是以单纯营利为目的，囤积货物，贱价收买，高价出卖。因此引起群众的极大不满。完县政府根据以上的情况，呈准专署予齐振海以撤职处分。
