Ordering Timber Causes Timber Price Fluctuations
Directorate General of Telecommunications Accepts Reader Criticism

Editor:

Recently, the Central People's Government Directorate General of Telecommunications entrusted Tianjin Xinhua Timber Company to purchase a large quantity of timber in Changzhou. This transaction was first handled by Tianjin Xinhua Timber Company turning to a certain Shanghai timber company for purchase on their behalf. The Shanghai timber company then turned to Changzhou Yongfengsheng Timber Company for ordering. Yongfengsheng Timber Company then purchased from the Timber Industry Association in Changzhou city. According to the above situation, there were at least three intermediaries. The profit situation of Yongfengsheng Timber Company is as follows: 28-foot-long utility poles were bought for 128,000 yuan per pole and sold for 168,000 yuan, with a high profit of 40,000 yuan per pole. 30-foot-long utility poles were bought for 136,000 yuan per pole and sold for 180,000 yuan, with a high profit of 44,000 yuan per pole. The intermediary profits of the Shanghai timber company and Tianjin Xinhua Timber Company are still unknown. Assuming their profits are the same as Yongfengsheng Timber Company's exploitation, the government would have to pay double the price to purchase this batch of timber.

State-owned enterprises directly purchasing equipment from private merchants does present difficulties (such as not being able to fully understand market conditions, lack of skilled procurement personnel, etc.). However, they can request the assistance of local industry and commerce bureaus or state-owned trading companies for procurement, or order through local timber industry associations (as the East China Shipyard did when purchasing timber in Changzhou last time). If it is necessary to entrust private merchants to handle the matter, all circumstances should be understood before the transaction is concluded, careful calculations should be made, and merchants should be given reasonable profits they deserve. Therefore, we believe that the comrades in charge of the Directorate General of Telecommunications' procurement of this batch of timber have not fulfilled their due responsibilities. We also suspect that there may be acts of corruption and malfeasance. We hope that the government will pay due attention to this matter.

In order to protect state property, I request the relevant departments to investigate this matter. If it is true, a public self-criticism should be made in the newspaper.

Editor's Note: The problem reflected by Comrade Wang Shouzhen has been forwarded to the Central People's Government Directorate General of Telecommunications for investigation and reply. The following is a reply letter from the Equipment Department of the Directorate:

Editor:

The situation reflected in the letter from Comrade Wang Shouzhen of Changzhou Yixin Timber Company is basically correct. The course of events is as follows: In order to expedite the construction of main lines between cities in North China, the Directorate General of Telecommunications needed about 50,000 utility poles, which were originally being purchased in Northeast China, Shanxi, and other places. Because the situation was not adequately investigated beforehand, the supply plan for April could not be guaranteed. Therefore, an order was placed with three private timber companies in Tianjin, Xinhua, Tongqing, and Xiangsen, for 20,000 utility poles (1,500 poles were delivered immediately, and the rest were to be delivered in batches within one and a half months). The average price per utility pole was 276,125 yuan, totaling 5.52 billion yuan. These three timber companies had no stock in Tianjin. In order to complete the delivery within the time limit, they purchased from various places in East China and Central South China. The purchase by Xinhua Timber Company went through three intermediaries, which we were unaware of. However, in Hankou, the large-scale purchases by the above three companies did indeed promote fluctuations in timber prices in Wuhan, Nanjing, and other places. For example, the timber price in Wuhan at that time suddenly rose from 500,000 yuan per two yards (approximately four pieces of 8.5-meter timber) to 700,000 yuan. According to preliminary estimates, the price of the timber purchased by the three companies in Hankou and transported to Tianjin was about 75,000 yuan higher per pole than the price of the timber purchased by the Central China Telecommunications Bureau in the production area and transported to Tianjin. Calculated at 20,000 poles, the total difference is 1.5 billion yuan. This indeed created an opportunity for intermediaries to obtain exorbitant profits and also caused fluctuations in timber prices.

The reasons for this incident are: We did not investigate and study the actual situation of timber in various places beforehand (such as the production and sales situation of timber production areas across the country, timber quality, types, logging costs, and market prices), and then entered into a contract with private merchants. And we never considered that large-scale purchases would cause fluctuations in market timber prices. This is a manifestation of irresponsibility in our work. We fully accept Comrade Wang Shouzhen's criticism of us.

As for the situation of corruption and malfeasance mentioned by Comrade Wang, after our investigation, we can guarantee that this is not the case. However, we are willing to accept the government's further in-depth inspection of us.

### 定购木材引起木价波动  电信总局接受读者批评

　　定购木材引起木价波动  电信总局接受读者批评编辑同志：
    最近中央人民政府电信总局，委托天津新华木行在常州市收购大批木材。这笔交易，先由天津新华木行转向上海某木行代购。上海某木行又转向常州永丰盛木行定购。永丰盛木行又在常州本市向木业公会购买。据上述情况，至少有三次转手。永丰盛木行所得利润的情况是这样的：二十八英尺长的电杆，每根买进为十二万八千元，卖出为十六万八千元，每根获四万元的高额利润。三十英尺长的电杆，每根买进十三万六千元，卖出为十八万元，每根获四万四千元的高额利润。上海某木行及天津新华木行的转手利润尚不得而知。假定他们的利润和永丰盛木行的剥削一样，政府就要付出双倍的代价来买进这批木材。
    国营企业直接向私商购买器材，困难是有的（如对市场情况不能全面了解、缺乏熟练的办货人员等）。但可以请求各地工商局或国营贸易公司协助采购，或通过各地木业公会订购（如上次华东区造船厂在常州购买木材时，就是这样办的）。如果必须委托私商代办，亦应在成交前了解全部情况，精打细算，给商人以应得的合理利润。因此，我们认为电信总局采购这批木料的负责同志，没有尽到应尽的职责。我们还怀疑其中可能有贪污舞弊的行为。希望政府对这件事予以应有的注意。
    为了爱护国家财产，我要求有关部门调查这件事。如果属实，应该在报上作公开检讨。

    编者按：汪守箴同志所反映的问题，经我们转请中央人民政府电信总局调查答复。下面是该局器材处的复信。编辑同志：
    常州市义鑫木行汪守箴同志来信反映的情况基本上是正确的。事情的经过如下：电信总局为了急于修建华北区各城市间的主要线路，需用电杆约五万余根，原在东北、山西等地进行采购。因为在事先对情况调查不够，未能保证四月份的供应计划，故向天津私营新华、同庆、祥森三家木行定购电杆二万根（当即交货一千五百根，其他分批在一个半月内交清）。平均每根电杆价为二十七万六千一百二十五元，共计五十五亿二千余万元。该三家木行在津并无现货。为完成限期交货，分别在华东、中南各地收购。新华木行的收购是经过三次转手，我们并不知道。但在汉口方面，由于上述三行的大批收购，确实促成武汉、南京等地木价的波动。如武汉当时的木价即由每两码（约合八米半的木材四根）五十万元突然上升为七十万元。据初步估计，该三家木行在汉口方面收购运往天津的价格，与华中区电信局在产地收购运往天津的价格，每根相差约七万五千元左右。按二万根计算，全部差额为十五亿元。这确实造成了中间商人获得暴利的机会，同时又引起了木价的波动。
    造成这次事件的原因是：我们在事先并未去调查研究各地木材的实际情况（如全国木材产地的产销情况、木材质量、种类、砍伐成本与市场价格等），就与私商订立合同。并且从未考虑到大批收购会引起市场木价的波动。这是对工作不负责任的表现。我们完全接受汪守箴同志对我们的批评。
    至于汪同志所提有无贪污舞弊的情况，经过我们调查，我们可以保证是没有这种情况的。但我们愿意接受政府对我们进行更深入的检查。
