[Report from this newspaper] In Plain Province, the number of year-round people's schools in various regions has continued to increase in recent months. In May, according to statistics from 48 counties, 5 urban districts, and 1 city, there were a total of 7,501 people's schools with an enrollment of 308,102 students. This represents an increase of 1,961 schools and 45,389 students compared to April. Currently, the focus of the Provincial Department of Education's guidance for people's schools in various regions is on consolidating the existing foundation and ensuring that they combine learning with production during the busy farming season, while continuing to study.

Leadership work in people's schools in various areas has gradually been strengthened. Villages that have established people's schools have generally organized a people's school committee or a people's school headquarters headed by the village chairman to ensure division of responsibilities and collective leadership. In Lin County of this province, some villages have organized rural clubs to provide unified leadership for propaganda and education work. For example, the Donggang Village Club is led by the main village cadres and has three departments. The Political Education Department is headed by the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary and selects political teaching materials for the people's school based on the ideological situation of the masses; the School Education Department is headed by the village's propaganda and education committee member and is responsible for the work of the people's school and primary school; the Culture and Entertainment Department is headed by the village drama troupe leader and controls propaganda tools such as mass blackboards, radio stations, and drama troupes. Several staff members are hired according to the complexity of each department's work. This planned division of responsibilities strengthens the leadership. At the same time, people's school organizations in various regions generally pay attention to combining with production organizations. In order not to delay production time, men generally study during the midday break, while women study in the afternoon. Most people's schools implement a method of decentralized self-study and regular collective classes. They strengthen the leadership, supervision, and inspection of small groups, and establish regular testing systems. The content and methods of learning mostly focus on combining learning with application, and students begin practicing using what they have learned after learning dozens of characters. Some people's schools also conduct production technology education. For example, the Huazhuang School in the Seventh District of Puyang County studies in the people's school that planting millet in fields with a lot of "荠荠菜" (shepherd's purse, a rapidly spreading weed that is difficult to remove and hinders crop growth) can reduce "荠荠菜"; and that sheep manure can improve crop growth on alkaline land. After learning this, everyone planted millet on "荠荠菜" land and paid attention to accumulating sheep manure to transform alkaline land. Furthermore, Zexia Village and suburban villages in Lin County organized old farmer technology research associations, composed of village labor models, production experts, voluntary teachers, primary school teachers, and propaganda and education committee members. They selected a technical expert as the director and a cotton planting model as the deputy director. Everyone studied and discussed how to grow cotton, how to apply fertilizer, and how to prevent pests and diseases. They then went to the people's school to teach lessons related to current production, and after the students learned, they went to their homes or to the mess halls (where the masses ate) to publicize, playing a propaganda and mobilization role in production. Then, they collected the masses' feedback and experience, and brought it to the people's school and the technology research association for research, and then publicized it to the masses. The masses are very satisfied with this method of mutual research and mutual improvement.

At present, there are still many shortcomings in the work of people's schools. Some cadres do not have a correct understanding of literacy education, believing that there must be collective large classes of 30 to 50 people to be considered a people's school, and neglecting the leadership of flexible learning organizations suitable for the masses. For example, in the Dashanqian School in Hui County, 26 young people spontaneously organized to continue their winter school studies, but the leadership did not recognize them as a people's school and did not lead them. Because they did not have teachers, they implemented mutual teaching and mutual learning, but their learning was blind and chaotic, studying some Shanxi magazines, the Hundred Family Surnames, primary school textbooks, etc. Secondly, some people's school leaders do not go deep enough, and decentralized learning has formed a state of anarchy. For example, in some people's schools in Qingfeng County, only the collective learning once every ten days was paid attention to, and the decentralized learning for the remaining nine days was not carried out. In addition, the untimely and non-universal distribution of teaching materials has also affected the learning enthusiasm of the masses.

　　平原民校学员增至三十万人  部分民校结合学习研究生产
    【本报讯】平原省各地的常年民校，近月来仍在陆续增加。五月份，据四十八个县、五个城关区、一个市的统计，共有民校七千五百零一处，入学人数三十万八千一百零二名。较四月份增加了民校一千九百六十一处，四万五千三百八十九人。现在，该省教育厅对各地民校的指导重点，在于巩固现有基础，并使其在农忙中结合生产，坚持学习。
    各地民校的领导工作已逐渐加强，凡建立了民校的村，一般都组织了以村主席为首的民校委员会，或民校校部，作到分工负责、集体领导。该省林县一部分村庄，则组织了农村俱乐部，统一领导宣教工作。如东岗村俱乐部，由村的主要干部负责主持，下设三个部门。政治教育部由中共支部书记负责，针对群众思想情况，选定民校政治教材；学校教育部由村宣教委员负责，负责民校和小学的工作；文化娱乐部由村剧团团长负责，掌握大众黑板报、广播台、剧团等宣传工具。根据各部门工作的繁简，聘请若干干事。这样有计划地分工负责，就加强了领导的力量。同时，各地民校组织普遍注意了与生产组织的结合。为了不耽误生产时间，一般是男子在中午歇息时学习，妇女则在下午学习。大部民校都实行分散自学、定期集体上课的办法。平时加强小组的领导和督促检查，并建立定期测验等制度。学习的内容与方法大部注意了学用结合，学了几十个字之后就开始练习使用。一部分民校中并进行了生产技术教育，如濮阳县七区化庄校，在民校中研究生“荠荠菜”（一种蔓延迅速、清除困难，妨碍农作物生长的野草）多的地种谷子可减少“荠荠菜”；碱地上羊粪可以长好庄稼等生产常识。大家学了之后，都把“荠荠菜”地种上谷子，注意积羊粪改造碱地。又如林县泽下村及郊村组织了老农技术研究会，由村里劳动模范、生产能手、义务教员、小学教员、宣教委员等组成，选出一个技术能手为主任，一个植棉模范为副主任。大家研究讨论如何种棉花、怎样施肥与防止病虫害等方法，又分别到民校结合当前生产有关的课文进行教学，学员学习后，并到家里或饭市（群众吃饭的地方）上宣传，发挥了民校在生产中的宣传鼓动作用。然后再收集群众的反映和经验，提到民校和技术研究会研究，再向群众宣传。这种互相研究、互相提高的学习方法，群众很满意。
    目前民校工作还有不少缺点。有的干部对识字教育的认识不正确，认为必须有三五十个人集体上大课才算民校，而忽视对适合群众的灵活性的学习组织的领导。如辉县大山前校有二十六个青年自动组织起来继续冬学的学习，但领导上却不承认他们是民校，没有领导他们。他们因为没有教师，就实行互教互学，但在学习上是盲目的，乱学一些山西杂志、百家姓、小学课本等。其次，一部分民校领导不深入，实行分散学习中形成了自流。如清丰县有的民校，只注意了十天一次的集体学习，其余九天的分散学习没有搞起来。此外，教材的发行不及时、不普遍，也影响了群众的学习情绪。
