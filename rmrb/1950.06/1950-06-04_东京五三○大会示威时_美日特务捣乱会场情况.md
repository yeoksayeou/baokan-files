Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd dispatch from TASS, Tokyo: The National Democratic Front Preparatory Committee organized a mass rally in Tokyo on May 30th. Although Japanese police and American authorities tried every means to disrupt the gathering, 50,000 people, including workers, students, small merchants, and Korean residents in Japan, participated. Representatives from the National Trade Union Liaison Committee, the Youth Fatherland Front, democratic overseas Chinese groups, the Communist Party, and the Labor-Farmer Party delivered speeches. The assembly resolved to oppose the colonization of Japan and its transformation into an American military base, advocating for the restoration of peacetime industries and the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. The assembly also passed a resolution to strive for the unity of the working class's struggle front to resist the oppression of the Japanese Communist Party, calling on all patriots to unite within the National Democratic Front. The assembly also passed a resolution supporting the Stockholm Appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress.

During the assembly, many agents of the US Counterintelligence Corps tried to provoke the masses, resulting in minor clashes. Eight people were arrested for allegedly "attacking" American soldiers. Despite the complete lack of evidence, Willoughby, the chief of MacArthur Headquarters Intelligence Group, ordered these eight people to be brought to a military court, starting the trial on May 31st, and proceeding with the trial very hastily. American prosecutor Sullivan claimed that the defendants would be sentenced to ten years of hard labor.

The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida is drafting a bill modeled after the American fascist Mundt Act to be submitted at a special session of parliament in the future to control the activities of the Japanese Communist Party.

　　东京五三○大会示威时  美日特务捣乱会场情况
    【新华社讯】塔斯社上海二日电东京讯：全国民主阵线筹备委员会于五月三十日在东京组织了群众大会。虽然日本警察及美国当局想尽方法要破坏集会，但仍有工人、学生、小商人、与日境的朝鲜侨民等五万人参加。出席演讲的有全国工会联络委员会代表、及青年祖国阵线、民主华侨团体、共产党、劳农党等代表。大会决议反对把日本殖民地化及把日本变为美国军事基地，主张恢复和平时期工业，与日本订立全面的和约等。大会并通过决议，争取工人阶级斗争阵线的团结以反抗对日本共产党的压迫，号召一切爱国人士团结在全国民主阵线之内。大会也通过决议，支持世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议的宣言。
    在大会进行时，许多美军反间谍队的特务分子设法挑惹群众，因此曾发生小的冲突。有八人被指为“攻击”美国兵士而被捕。尽管完全没有证据，但麦克阿瑟总部谍报组组长威洛贝竟然下令把这八人带至军事法庭，于五月三十一日开始审讯，并非常匆促地进行审讯。美国检察官沙利文称，被告等将被判处十年苦役。
    读卖新闻称，日首相吉田正拟订一个美国法西斯蒙特法案式的法案，要在将来的议会特别会议上提出，以控制日共的活动。
