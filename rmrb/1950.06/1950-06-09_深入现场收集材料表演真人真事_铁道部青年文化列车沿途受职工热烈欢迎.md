    The Youth Cultural Train of the Ministry of Railways is Warmly Welcomed by Employees Along the Way
    [Our Newspaper] The Youth Cultural Train of the Ministry of Railways, composed of the Ministry of Railways and the China Youth Art Theater, departed from Beijing on March 25. It performed dramas, operas, and screened movies for railway workers along the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai Railways, and was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers. In two months, they first went to Luoyang to participate in the opening ceremony of the Luoyang River Main Bridge and performed for a detachment of the Railway Corps; then they performed more than 40 times in Shanzhou, Luoyang, Zhengzhou and other places, with the largest audience reaching 7,000 people per show. Most of the programs they performed were short, concise, lively, and vigorous; they also collected materials from the workers at any time to arrange new programs, singing about the real people and events there, so they were extremely loved by the workers and achieved good publicity and educational results. For example, at the opening ceremony of the Luoyang River Main Bridge, they performed "The Luoyang River Bridge." The actors personally participated in lifting steel rails and installing sleepers to experience the life of the workers, and also asked the soldiers of the Railway Corps to help direct. In Zhengzhou, they performed "Four Sisters' New Year Greetings," using the facts of four workers to educate the workers, explaining that to do a good job, everyone must unite, and individual efforts by a few people are not enough.
    Wherever the literary and art workers of the train went, they were organized to go to the front lines to help workers carry out cultural and recreational activities. The "Mobile Cultural Supply Station," jointly composed of the China Youth Publishing House, the Workers' Publishing House, Xinhua Bookstore, and Sanlian Bookstore, also accompanied the train to supply workers with cultural reading materials at low prices in various places. Therefore, the Youth Cultural Train was warmly welcomed by railway workers in various places, and six units presented them with red flags. (Song Xiuye, Lu Zhicheng)

　　提倡文学艺术为人民服务，启发人民的政治觉悟，鼓励人民的劳动热情。
    人民政协共同纲领第四十五条
    深入现场收集材料表演真人真事
    铁道部青年文化列车沿途受职工热烈欢迎
    【本报讯】由铁道部与中国青年艺术剧院组成的铁道部青年文化列车，自三月二十五日由北京出发，沿京汉、陇海两铁路为沿线铁路职工演出话剧、歌剧和放映电影等，获得广大工人群众的热烈欢迎。两个月中，他们首先开往洛阳，参加了洛河正桥的通车典礼，并为铁道兵团某支队演出；继又在陕州、洛阳、郑州等地前后共演出四十余次，每场观众最多者达七千人。他们表演的节目绝大部分是短小精干、生动活泼的；并随时在工人中收集材料，编排新的节目，到那里就唱那里的真人真事，因此极为工人所喜爱，并收到良好的宣传教育效果。如在洛河正桥通车典礼上，他们演出了《洛河桥》。演员们曾亲自参加抬钢轨、装枕木，以体会工人生活，并曾请铁道兵团的战士帮助导演。在郑州，他们出演了《四姊妹拜年》，通过四个工人的事实来教育工人，说明要做好工作必须大家团结一致，光靠少数人的个别努力还是不够的。
    列车的文艺工作人员每到一处，就有组织地分散到现场帮助工人搞文娱活动。由青年出版社、工人出版社、新华书店、三联书店合组成的“流动文化供应站”，并随车在各地廉价供应工人文化读物。因此，青年文化列车获得各地铁路职工的热烈欢迎，并有六个单位赠以红旗。（宋修业、卢志成）
