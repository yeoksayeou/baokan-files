    Congratulations on the Establishment of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles
    Lao She
　　Congratulating the establishment of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, I think its establishment will have at least the following benefits:

    (1) In terms of connections, art workers in various departments in Beijing can have the opportunity to exchange opinions together, or even further cooperate in creation. Without the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, everyone will inevitably act on their own, not communicating with each other; whether in research or creation, it is inevitable to grope alone in the dark, achieving half the results with twice the effort.

    (2) Beijing is the capital of New China. Although the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, like other federations, works under the leadership of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, it should play a leading role in work and unity due to its special environment and the gathering of talents. Especially in unity, as long as we are united, we will give other federations a good example, teaching them the spirit and style of "brothers unite to fight tigers, fathers and sons go to battle together." Then, if the federations of literary and art circles across the country are well united, the work of literature and art can take root and blossom everywhere, and bear rich fruits. I believe that since we are workers of literature and art, we must all have a grand ideal; and today, our ideal must be to hope that the national literary and artistic work will develop universally, so that China becomes a new country with a high level of culture. The realization of this ideal may be difficult to achieve by the power of a few people. So, let us first have solid unity in Beijing, reaching up to the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and extending to brother federations in various places, to realize our ideal.

    (3) Beijing's famous Quyi and traditional opera artists are also nationally renowned performers. Their performance locations are not limited to Beijing. As far as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong, they all have the opportunity to be invited to perform. As long as you talk about Beijing Rhyme Drum and Peking Opera, they are valued everywhere. Today, a nationwide opera reform movement has been launched; then, the transformed artists in Beijing should also play a leading role in various places. Half of the representatives of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles are elected by the opera community, which tells us that, through the unity of the Federation, the workers in the Beijing opera community should not only have a good influence on opera reform in Beijing, but also in various places.

    (4) Beijing, in terms of cultural tradition and today's needs, has its own conditions and requirements; and literary and artistic workers must use these conditions to meet these requirements. The mission of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles is, at least under unity, to explore clearly those conditions and requirements with concerted efforts, and then decide how to promote the work. This mission can only be borne by the Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

    Briefly listing the above four points is enough to prove that the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles is a necessary organization today. Of course, it will inevitably have many difficulties and troubles; however, as long as everyone works together, things cannot go wrong. Here, I wish the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles victory and success!

    祝北京市文联成立
    老舍
　　祝北京市文联成立我想，北京市文联的成立，至少会有下列的好处：
    （一）在联系上，北京的艺术各部门的工作者可以有机会在一块儿交换意见，或更进一步的在创作上合作起来。没有文联，大家就不免各自为政，不相闻问；无论在研究上或创作上都难免单独的在暗中摸索，事倍而功半。
    （二）北京是新中国的首都，虽然北京的文联也和别处的文联一样，同在全国文联领导下工作，可是因环境的特殊，人才的集聚，它理应在工作上，团结上，起些带头的作用。特别是在团结上，只要我们团结得好，我们便给别处的文联一个好榜样，教别处的文联也有“打虎亲兄弟，上阵父子兵”的精神与作风。那么，全国各地的文联若都团结得好，文学与艺术的工作才能到处生根开花，并且结出肥美的果实。我相信，我们既是文学与艺术的工作者，我们一定都有个远大的理想；而在今天，我们的理想必是希望全国的文学艺术工作普遍的发展开，教中国成为有高度文化的新国家。这个理想的实现，恐怕绝难是几个人的力量所能作到的。那么，就让我们先在北京有了巩固的团结，上达全国文联，旁及各地的兄弟文联，去实现我们的理想。
    （三）北京的曲艺旧剧的名家也就是全国驰名的角色。他们献技的地点不限于北京。远及川滇两广，他们都有机会被邀请，去献艺。只要谈到京韵鼓书和京剧，不论在哪里，他们都被人重视。在今天，全国普遍的展开了戏曲改革运动；那么，北京经过改造的艺人也应该对各处起带头作用。北京文联的代表有一半是由戏曲界选出的，这就已经告诉我们，通过文联的团结，北京戏曲界的工作者，应当不单在北京，而且也在各地，发生改革戏曲的好影响。
    （四）北京，在文化传统上，在今日的需要上，都有它自己的条件与要求；而文学艺术工作者也就必须利用这条件，满足这要求。北京文联的使命至少是在团结之下，群策群力的去摸索清楚那些条件与要求，然后决定怎样去推动工作。这使命也只有文联才负得起来。
    略举上述四点，已足证明北京文联是今天所必需的一个团体。当然，它必有许多的困难与麻烦；可是，只要大家齐心努力，事情就没有搞不好的。于此，谨祝北京文联的胜利与成功！
