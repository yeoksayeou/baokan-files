　　Lin Nan Cang Supply and Marketing Cooperative Failed to Sun Grain Promptly
    Forty Thousand Jin of Corn Spoiled
    Branch Director Has Made a Self-Criticism and Requested Punishment
    [This report from Yutian] (Our paper's Yutian news) Due to the Lin Nan Cang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yutian County, Hebei Province, failing to promptly turn and sun the grain, more than forty thousand *jin* of northeastern corn allocated by the county cooperative spoiled. The director of the branch has made a profound self-criticism regarding this matter and has requested punishment. On April 6th, the Yutian County Cooperative allocated more than 246,550 *jin* of northeastern corn to the branch. Because the grain was too damp, the county cooperative and the grain depot sent people to the branch on several occasions to urge them to seize the time to sell it. The branch director believed that the grain would not spoil if it was sold at any time. Therefore, although it was stipulated that inspections should be carried out every three to five days, with dedicated personnel in charge, it became a mere formality. Lei Qingfu, the person in charge, subjectively said: "It doesn't matter whether it's sunned or not, I'll be responsible if it spoils." The leading cadres of the cooperative also became complacent as a result. It was not until May 17th, when the grain-buying masses complained that the corn had a moldy smell, that attention was drawn to the issue. Upon inspection, more than 43,000 *jin* had already molded by 20 percent. This portion of moldy grain had to be sold at a low price, resulting in a loss of more than 4.06 million *yuan* to the state.
    After the incident, Bai Huating, the director of the branch, and all the cadres made profound self-criticisms, believing that this was a manifestation of neglecting state property and lacking a sense of responsibility. They immediately admitted their mistakes to the higher authorities and requested that they be given the punishment they deserved.

　　林南仓供销分社晒粮不及时
    霉坏玉米四万余斤   
    分社主任已作检讨并自请处分
    【本报玉田讯】河北省玉田县林南仓供销分社，因翻晒粮食不及时，致使县社拨给的东北玉米霉坏了四万余斤，该分社主任对此已作深刻检讨，并自请处分。玉田县社在四月六日拨给该分社东北玉米二十四万六千五百五十多斤，因粮食太潮湿，故县社及粮库均曾派人到该分社三番五次嘱其应抓紧时间卖出。该分社主任即认为随时出售粮食当不致霉坏，故虽规定三、五天检查一次，并专人负责，但却流于形式。专管人雷庆富主观地说：“晒不晒没关系，坏了我负责。”社领导干部亦因此而麻痹起来。直到五月十七日，买粮群众提出玉米已有霉味，才引起注意。经检查时，已有四万三千多斤发霉了百分之二十。这部分霉粮只好低价出售，致使国家损失了四百零六万余元。
    事后，该分社主任白华庭和全体干部均作了深刻检讨，认为这是忽视国家财产和缺乏责任心的表现，即向上级承认错误，请求予以应得之处分。
