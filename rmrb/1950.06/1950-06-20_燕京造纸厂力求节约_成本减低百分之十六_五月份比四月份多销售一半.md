　　Yanjing Paper Mill Strives for Economy: Costs Reduced by Sixteen Percent
    May Sales Increase by Half Compared to April
    [This Newspaper's Report] The workers of Yanjing Paper Mill are continuing to struggle to reduce costs and vigorously promote product sales. The factory achieved considerable success in May, with a 16.6% reduction in total monthly production costs compared to April, and a 58.5% increase in product sales compared to April.

    The reduction in costs is mainly due to conservation. The best results in conservation were achieved in the boiler room. The boiler room workers found through research that it is not advisable to add too much coal at a time; it should be spread evenly and not stoked too quickly; coal dust should be mixed with water, so the fire will be stronger and save coal. In the past, because too much coal was added each time, it took one or two minutes for the fire to ignite. If it had to be poked, unburned coal dust would leak down, resulting in a great loss. They also diligently removed scale, cleaned furnace ash, picked up coal slag, constantly checked for steam leaks, and improved the installation of steam pipes. This reduced the coal consumption quota per pound of paper from seven jin to 5.79 jin. A total of 31,980 jin of coal was saved in May. According to the excess quota reward method, each worker in the boiler room received a bonus of 120 jin of millet. Also, because the boiler room had exceeded the quota for three consecutive months, the administration awarded them a prize banner. In the first and second pulping shifts, in February and March of this year, each tank (500 pounds of Xuan paper base) required three hours to pulp. In April, an average record of one hour and twenty minutes was created. In May, the second pulping shift averaged only one hour and two minutes, and the first shift one hour and thirteen minutes. A total of 646 kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved in the month.

    In other areas, such as the No. 1 paper machine saving a copper mesh, and the No. 3 paper machine using old blankets to produce paper, saving two new blankets, ironworkers and electricians tried their best to utilize and transform waste materials. In order to reduce costs, everyone, in the spirit of doing the work of three people with two, saved thirty-seven temporary workers every day. In May, repair costs were reduced from 15 million yuan to 9 million yuan, and indirect material costs were reduced from 42 million yuan to 32 million yuan, resulting in a total cost reduction of 16.6%.

    While reducing costs, attention was also paid to improving product quality. The workers held meetings to discuss how to improve quality, and put forward forty or fifty rationalization proposals. After studying these proposals, the leaders implemented them immediately if they could be implemented. Worker Zhu Ke proposed to改造浆槽, add small boxes, to reduce overflow foam, which had a great effect on improving product quality after implementation. All departments also strengthened their sense of responsibility, and the raw material department was particularly careful in selecting materials. The foremen also strengthened the inspection system.

    For sales work, a blitz method was adopted in May. On the one hand, advertisements were placed in newspapers, and discounts and price reductions were offered from May 1st to 10th. On the other hand, close attention was paid to the various consignment stores, giving them certain tasks, and vigorously promoting sales. A total of 7,641 reams were sold in May, 58.5% more than in April.

    Sales work was further strengthened in June. According to the sales figures for the first ten days of the month alone, sales have increased by 1.2% compared to the total sales volume in April.

### 燕京造纸厂力求节约  成本减低百分之十六  五月份比四月份多销售一半

　　燕京造纸厂力求节约  成本减低百分之十六
    五月份比四月份多销售一半
    【本报讯】燕京造纸厂职工正继续为减低成本、大力推销产品而斗争。该厂五月份已做出相当成绩，全月生产成本已较四月份减低百分之一六·六，产品推销比四月份增加百分之五八·五。
    减低成本方面主要是节约。节约成绩最好的是锅炉房。锅炉房工友研究出每次上煤不宜太多，要撒得匀，不能掏得太快，煤末要加水拌匀，这样火力大，又省煤。过去因为每次上煤太多，要隔一、二分钟火才能燃起；如要拨弄它，未经燃烧的煤末就漏下来，损失很大。他们并勤打水碱，掏炉灰，拣煤渣，随时检查有没有漏汽的地方，又改善了汽管的装置。这样使得每磅纸用煤定额，由七斤减到五·七九斤。五月份共节约三万一千九百八十斤煤，按超额奖励的办法，锅炉房工友每人得奖金一百二十斤小米；又因为锅炉房一连三个月都超过定额，行政方面给予奖旗一面。打浆第一、二两班，今年二、三月间，每槽（五百磅宣本）需打三小时，四月份已创出平均一时二十分的纪录，五月份打浆第二班平均只用一时零二分，第一班一时十三分。全月共节省用电六四六度。
    其余如一号抄纸机节省一块铜网，三号抄纸机利用旧毛毯出纸，节省了二块新毛毯，铁工电工尽量利用与改造废料；大家为了减低成本，本着三个人的事两个人做的精神，每天节省了三十七个临时工；五月份修理费用由一千五百万元减到九百万元，间接材料费用由四千二百万元减到三千二百万元；使总成本减低百分之一六·六。
    减低成本同时也注意了产品质量的提高。工友们为提高质量问题，开会讨论，提出了大小四、五十条合理化建议。领导方面研究了这些建议后，能实行的就立即付诸实行。工友朱克提出改造浆槽，加小箱，以减少溢沫的建议，实行后，对提高产品质量有很大效果。各部门也都加强了责任心，原料部选料时特别仔细。班长也加强了检查制度。
    推销工作，五月份采取了突击办法。一方面登报宣传，从五月一日到十日打折扣减价出售；一方面抓紧了各代销店，给予一定任务，大力推销。五月份全月共销出七、六四一令，较四月份多销出百分之五八·五。
    六月份又加强了推销工作，仅据上旬十天推销数字，已较四月份全月推销量增多百分之一·二。
