　　Shanghai Higher Education Institutions' Preliminary Simplification of Courses

[This Newspaper News] According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: The first step in the curriculum reform of Shanghai higher education institutions—simplifying courses—has come to an end.

Shanghai currently has a total of forty public and private universities and colleges. During the reactionary government's rule, the courses in each school were extremely heavy, many of which were unreasonable or repetitive. Some courses were set up to accommodate private interests or to make up enough teaching hours. For example, the student with the most elective courses in the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tongji University used to attend classes for up to 51 hours per week, often studying the same subject two or three times. Fudan University stipulated that each professor should teach nine hours per week, so many unnecessary courses were added to make up the teaching hours. The Transportation Management Department of Jiaotong University adopted many textbooks from the private railway system, and some departments rigidly transplanted the curriculum of British and American graduate schools. The excessive curriculum not only made it impossible for students to master their studies, and professors to improve educational efficiency, but also seriously depleted the energy and health of young people. At the same time, due to the heavy workload of professional courses, students had no time to study political courses and participate in extracurricular activities.

After the liberation of Shanghai, the People's Government, in addition to abolishing a number of reactionary courses, adopted a steady and progressive approach to curriculum reform. Over the past year, under the planning and leadership of the education authorities, teachers and students of each school have undergone long-term ideological deliberation and democratic discussion, put forward simplification plans, submitted them to the education authorities for approval, and carried out preliminary simplification. Currently, the weekly teaching hours (including internships) for liberal arts, law, and business schools are below 24 hours, for science, engineering, and agriculture schools about 21 hours, and for medical schools slightly more. The simplification methods include discontinuing courses, changing required courses to elective courses, shortening time, reducing teaching materials, merging courses with similar content, and simplifying experiments.

After the simplification of the courses in each school, students can submit their homework on time and maintain a normal life rhythm. The phenomenon of working late into the night has been generally reduced or even eliminated. In particular, the relationship between teachers and students has been greatly improved on the basis of jointly improving education. Both sides are gradually able to sincerely put forward opinions and conduct criticism and self-criticism.

### 上海高等学校课程初步精简

　　上海高等学校课程初步精简
    【本报讯】据新华社上海电：上海高等学校课程改革工作的第一步——精简课程已告一段落。
    上海现有公私立大学、专科院校共四十所。在反动政府统治时期，各校课程都极繁重，其中许多是不合理或重复的，有些课程是为了安插私人或为凑足钟点而设的。如同济大学机械系以前选课最多的学生，每周听课达五十一小时，往往一门功课重复学二、三遍。复旦大学规定每个教授每周上九小时课，因此为了凑足钟点，就添设了许多不必要的课程。交通大学运输管理系采用的是私有铁路制的许多教材，有的系则将英美研究院的课程生硬搬来。课程过重的结果，不但使学生无法精通学业，教授不能提高教育效率，并严重地损耗了青年的精力和健康。同时由于业务课程的繁重，学生无时间进行政治课的学习和课外活动。
    上海解放后人民政府除取缔了若干反动课程外，对课程改革采取了稳步前进的方针。一年以来在教育当局的筹划和领导下，各校师生经过长期思想酝酿和民主讨论，提出精简方案，呈请教育当局批准之后，进行了初步的精简。现文、法、商学院每周授课（包括实习）在二十四小时以下，理、工、农学院约二十一小时，医学院略多。精简的方式有停开、必修课改选修课、缩短时间、减少教材、合并内容相近的课程、简化实验等。
    各校课程精简后，学生的课外作业都能按时缴卷，也保持了正常的生活规律，开夜车的现象已普遍减少甚至消灭。特别是师生关系在共同搞好教育的基础上得到很大改善。双方渐能诚恳提出意见，进行批评与自我批评。
