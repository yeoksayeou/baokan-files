Shanghai Factory Safety and Health Committee
    Strengthens Security Inspection Work
    [This newspaper Shanghai News] Special correspondent Deng Xiudong reported: Since the Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau officially established the city's Factory Safety and Health Committee on April 25, it has strengthened inspections of the safety and health conditions of various factories, and promptly handled a number of disaster cases. This has drawn the attention of various factories to security work, resulting in some improvements in security work.
    According to statistics from the Labor Bureau on disaster cases handled, accidents caused by poor management, insufficient security education, and defective equipment accounted for more than 91% of all accidents. For example, in the No. 1 Jute Factory of the China Textile Corporation, some factory buildings were small, machines were arranged too closely together, belts and flywheels lacked protective devices, ventilation was poor, and the dust was so thick that it was impossible to see things a few steps away. This not only affected the health of the workers, but also made accidents more likely to occur. Five factories, including the Huasheng Pen Factory, rented a single-story building together. The raw material, celluloid, was flammable, but the factory did not pay attention to management. Due to the carelessness of an apprentice, a fire broke out, burning twelve apprentices to death. By industry, the vast majority of disaster cases occurred in the machinery industry, mainly because the protective equipment of machines (such as punch presses) was inadequate, and workers were negligent, resulting in accidents such as workers' fingers being crushed from time to time. The second most common were explosions in smelting furnaces, fires in the chemical industry, injuries from flying shuttles in the cotton spinning industry, falls and injuries in the construction industry, and general injuries from belts and gears.
    The Shanghai Factory Safety and Health Committee, based on the results of the investigation, further investigated the responsibility for the negligence and imposed penalties accordingly. It is now using the handling of cases to educate both labor and management, so that they can consciously establish the factory's security inspection system, in order to eliminate the occurrence of serious accidents.

　　上海工厂安全卫生委员会
    加强保安检查工作
    【本报上海讯】特约通讯员邓秀栋报道：上海市劳动局于四月二十五日正式成立全市工厂安全卫生委员会以来，由于加强检查各厂安全卫生情况，及时处理若干灾害案件，已引起各工厂对保安工作的注意，使保安工作得到若干改进。
    根据劳动局处理的灾害案件的统计，因管理不善，保安教育不够及设备不良而发生的事故，占全部事故的百分之九十一强。如中纺一麻厂部分厂房狭小，机器排列过密，皮带、飞轮没有防护装置，通风不良，灰尘多得像浓雾，几步以外就看不清事物，因此既影响工人健康，并且容易发生事故。华盛笔厂等五家工厂共租平房一幢，原料赛璐璐是易燃品，但厂方不注意管理，因学徒不慎，以致发生火灾，烧死学徒十二人。按行业讲，灾害案件以机器业占着绝大多数，主要因为机器（如冲床）防护设备不好，及工人的疏忽，以致轧断工人手指等事故时有发生。其次为冶炼业的熔炉爆炸，化工业的火灾，棉纺业的飞梭伤人，建筑业的跌伤堕伤，以及一般性的皮带、齿轮伤人。
    上海工厂安全卫生委员会根据调查结果，进一步追究过失责任，并分别予以处分。现正通过处理案件，教育劳资双方，使其自觉地建立该厂的保安检查制度，以期根绝严重事故的发生。
