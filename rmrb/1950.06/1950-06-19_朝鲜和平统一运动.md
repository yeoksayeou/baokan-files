　　Korean Peaceful Reunification Movement
    The Korean Fatherland Front held an enlarged meeting of its Central Committee on the 7th of this month. Following the proposal for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland last June, it once again put forward a specific plan for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland to all democratic political parties, social organizations, and the people of the whole of Korea, calling on all Korean people to promote its realization. This just call not only conforms to the wishes of all Korean people, but also benefits the cause of peace and democracy in the Far East and the world.
    The public enemy of the Korean people is the Syngman Rhee reactionary traitorous clique, the running dogs of American imperialism. For five years, under the direction of American imperialism, the Syngman Rhee gang has established a fascist rule in South Korea, preventing the Korean people's desire for peaceful reunification, and attempting to sell out South Korea as a colony and military base for American imperialism. Under the brutal massacre and bloody rule of the Syngman Rhee gang, South Korea's economy is increasingly bankrupt, and the people are living in hunger and terror. Under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the people of North Korea have broken away from feudal backwardness and begun to live a democratic, free, and happy life. Due to the contrast with North Korea, the people of South Korea have more clearly seen who their enemies are and who their saviors are. Disregarding all high-pressure tactics, they have carried out heroic resistance against American imperialism and its running dog Syngman Rhee clique, and launched large-scale guerrilla warfare. The Korean people's will to demand peaceful reunification is unjustifiable to refuse and cannot be suppressed by any force.
    The Korean peaceful reunification movement initiated by the Korean Fatherland Front is a part of the world democratic peace movement. Today, the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism is frantically preparing for a new war. In Asia, after suffering a shameful defeat in China, American imperialism is fostering Japanese reactionary forces, attempting to make Japan a colony and military base of the United States, while South Korea is a vanguard for the United States to implement its aggressive conspiracy in the Far East. Because of this, the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique is bound to undermine the Korean people's peaceful reunification movement. Therefore, it is becoming more and more isolated at home and abroad, while the Korean people's patriotic movement is gaining more and more sympathy from the people of Asia and the world. Under these internal and external circumstances, we believe that the just call of the Korean Fatherland Front will overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory!

### 朝鲜和平统一运动

专栏：短评

　　朝鲜和平统一运动
    朝鲜祖国战线于本月七日举行中央委员会扩大会议，继去年六月提出和平统一祖国方案之后，再度向全朝鲜各民主政党、社会团体和全国人民提出祖国和平统一的具体方案，号召全朝鲜人民促其实现。这个正义的号召，不但符合全朝鲜人民的愿望，而且有益于远东和世界和平民主事业。
    朝鲜人民的公敌是美帝国主义走狗李承晚反动卖国集团。五年来李承晚匪帮在美帝国主义指使下，在南朝鲜建立了法西斯统治，阻止朝鲜人民和平统一的愿望，妄图出卖南朝鲜作为美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。在李承晚匪帮残暴地屠杀和血腥的统治下，南朝鲜的经济日益破产，人民过着饥饿与恐怖的日子。而在朝鲜民主主义共和国领袖金日成将军领导下，北部朝鲜的人民已脱离了封建落后的社会，开始过着民主自由与幸福的生活。由于北朝鲜的对比，朝鲜南部人民更加明显地看出了谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的救星。他们不顾一切高压，向美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚集团进行了英勇的反抗，并发动了大规模的游击战争。朝鲜人民要求和平统一的意志，是没有任何理由可以加以拒绝，也是没有任何力量可以加以压制的。
    朝鲜祖国战线发起的朝鲜和平统一运动，是世界民主和平运动的一部分。今天以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，正在疯狂地准备新的战争。在亚洲，美帝国主义在中国遭到可耻的失败后，正在扶植日本反动势力，企图使日本成为美国的殖民地和军事基地，而南朝鲜则是美国在远东实施侵略阴谋的一个前卫。正因为这样，李承晚反动集团就必然要破坏朝鲜人民的和平统一运动，因之，它在国内外一天比一天孤立，而朝鲜人民的爱国运动，一天比一天得到亚洲和世界各国人民的同情。在这种内外形势之下，我们相信，朝鲜祖国战线的正义的号召，必能克服一切困难而得到最后的胜利！
