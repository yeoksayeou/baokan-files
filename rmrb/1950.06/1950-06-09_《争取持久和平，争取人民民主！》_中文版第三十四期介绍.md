Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: An introduction to the Chinese edition of the publication of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 34 (Total Issue 73) was published on June 3rd. The editorial in this issue discusses the heroic struggles of the working people in capitalist countries for peace, bread, and freedom, and points out that one of the main conditions for the victorious struggle of the working class is the unity of the working class ranks. At present, this unity is more important than ever.

The articles "The French People Strike at the Reactionaries" (by Shiubei, member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party) and "The Italian People Rise Up to Resist the Tyranny of the Gasperi Government" (by Longo, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party) describe the heroic struggles of the French and Italian people.

The article "The Birthday of Our Freedom" was written by Horvath, a member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Workers' Party, to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Hungary's liberation. This article points out that as a result of overfulfilling the Three-Year Plan, the living standards of the Hungarian people have increased by 40 percent compared to pre-war levels. The article compares the actual wages of Hungarian workers with the actual wages of French workers under the control of the "Marshall Plan." The article points out that in France, according to recent statistics, the average hourly wage is 65 francs. In Hungary, the average hourly wage in industry in December last year was 3.46 forints (Hungarian currency), which, together with social welfare payments, reached 4.22 forints. Converted into actual goods, it means: a Hungarian worker can get one kilogram of bread by working an average of 14 minutes; a French worker has to work 32 minutes to get one kilogram of bread. A Hungarian worker can get one kilogram of beef by working one hour and fifty minutes; a French worker has to work three hours and four minutes to get one kilogram of beef. The price difference for clothes is even greater. A Hungarian worker only needs to work 25 hours to buy a pair of shoes, while a French worker has to work 61 hours and 20 minutes to buy a pair of shoes. To buy a suit of clothes, it takes 95 hours of work in Hungary; in France, it takes 306 hours and 40 minutes.

The article "The Party Organization of the Polish United Workers' Party Struggles for the Economic Plan" (by Blinovsky, member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party) points out that practice has shown that there is an inseparable link between the struggle to realize the production plan and the work of the Party organization in the enterprise. Where the Party organization is strong, the results of completing the plan in quantity and quality are generally the best; conversely, where the Party organization is weak, its role is insufficient, and it is divorced from the urgent interests of production, this often becomes the main cause of various difficulties and confusion, and as a result, the plan cannot be completed. The article cites the example of the Sonovik coal mine, which, because the work of the Party organization was not carried out well, failed to complete the plan despite having all the conditions to do so. Later, when new people joined the leadership of the Party organization, and when propaganda groups were established in each workshop and established flexible daily contact with the workers, the situation in the mine began to improve rapidly. As a result, the mine has been able to gloriously complete its production tasks for several months. The article also points out that the most important thing for the Party organization to lead production is to organize labor competitions in the enterprise, and to enrich the content and form of the competition. The article also points out that one of the most important ways for the Party organization to find and utilize production potential is through production meetings. Convening production meetings makes it possible for workers to criticize shortcomings and make suggestions to improve the work of the enterprise. Therefore, the Party must attach great importance to the work of convening production meetings and do its best to organize them well.

In addition, the publication prominently features an article written by Lu Dingyi, Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, entitled "Education and Culture in New China."

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》
    中文版第三十四期介绍
    【新华社五日讯】共产党与工人党情报局机关刊物《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第三十四期（总第七十三期）已于六月三日出版。本期社论论述了资本主义各国劳动人民为和平、面包与自由而进行英勇斗争的情形，并且指出：工人阶级进行胜利斗争的主要条件之一便是工人阶级队伍的团结。目前，这一团结比以往任何时候更为重要。
    该刊所登载的《法国人民打击反动派》（法国共产党政治局委员修备作）及《意大利人民行动起来反抗加斯贝利政府的暴政》（意大利共产党总书记朗哥作）两文，叙述了法国人民和意大利人民的英勇斗争。
    《我们的自由的生日》一文是匈牙利工人党政治局委员霍瓦特为纪念匈牙利解放五周年而写的。这篇文章指出：由于超额完成三年计划的结果，匈牙利人民的生活标准已比战前提高了百分之四十。该文把匈牙利工人的实际工资与“马歇尔计划”控制下的法国工人的实际工资作了一个对比。该文指出：在法国，根据最近的统计，平均每小时工资是六十五法郎，在匈牙利，去年十二月份工业方面平均每小时工资时三点四六佛林特（匈牙利货币），而和社会福利费算在一起则达四点二二佛林特。折换成实际物品即是：匈牙利一个工人平均工作十四分钟可得一公斤面包；法国一个工人工作三十二分钟才能得到一公斤面包。匈牙利一个工人工作一小时又五十分钟可得一公斤牛肉；法国一个工人工作三小时零四分钟才能得一公斤牛肉。衣服的价格悬殊更大。匈牙利一个工人要买一双鞋只消工作二十五小时，法国一个工人得工作六十一小时零二十分钟才能买到一双鞋。买一身衣服，在匈牙利需要工作九十五小时；在法国必须工作三百零六小时又四十分钟。
    《波兰统一工人党的党组织为经济计划而斗争》（波兰统一工人党中央委员布林诺夫斯基作）一文指出：实践表明了，实现生产计划的斗争，与企业中党的组织的工作之间，有不可分的联系。党的组织力量强的地方，在数量上和质量上完成计划的成绩，一般说来，也是最好的；相反地，党的组织力量薄弱，起作用不够，脱离生产的紧要利益，这就往往成为产生种种困难和混乱的主要原因，而结果就完成不了计划。该文举例说：索诺威克煤矿因为党的组织的工作进行得不好，该煤矿虽然具有一切条件，却没有完成计划。后来当有新人参加了党的组织的领导时，当各车间都建立了鼓动员小组并与工人建立了灵活的日常联系时，该矿的情况就开始迅速改善了。其结果，该矿几个月来已能光荣地完成生产任务。该文并指出：党的组织领导生产的最主要的事情是在企业中组织劳动竞赛，并且使竞赛的内容和形式日益丰富起来。该文并指出：党组织寻找和利用生产潜力的最重要的方式之一，是生产会议。召开生产会议，使工人有可能对缺点进行批评，并提出建议来改进企业的工作。因此，党必须十分重视召开生产会议的工作，并尽力把它组织得好。
    此外，该刊并以显著地位登载了中共中央宣传部长陆定一所写的《新中国的教育与文化》一文。
