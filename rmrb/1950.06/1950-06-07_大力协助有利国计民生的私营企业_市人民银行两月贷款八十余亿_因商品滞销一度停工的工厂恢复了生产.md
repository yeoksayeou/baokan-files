　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has provided loans to assist private enterprises beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood in overcoming current difficulties in capital turnover. In April and May, a total of over 8.2 billion yuan in loans were issued. After receiving the loans, the private enterprises have maintained and are moving toward normal development through proper use and active management.
    The main targets of the bank's loans are industrial enterprises engaged in machine manufacturing, weaving and dyeing, and leather making, as well as commercial enterprises engaged in the transportation and sales of urban and rural goods and export trade. Since the stabilization of prices and the temporary stagnation of sales, in April and May, private industries received 3.46 billion yuan in loans, public-private joint ventures received 2.64 billion yuan, small handicrafts received over 7 million yuan, inter-port remittance received 250 million yuan, and special handicrafts received over 9 million yuan and export order packing remittance received 1.85 billion yuan through the Bank of China, benefiting a total of over 200 households. The amount of loans, when counted monthly, exceeded the figures of any previous month.
    The role of the loans is, first of all, to enable factories that had once suspended production due to stagnant sales to resume production. For example, Jingye Leather Factory, which has good product quality and development prospects, suspended production for a month due to stagnant sales. After receiving a loan of 70 million yuan, it purchased raw hides and resumed production. At the same time, many factories avoided shutdowns due to timely loans. For example, Jianguo Iron Factory, the only factory in the city that manufactures pig iron, received a loan of 200 million yuan, which replenished a large amount of raw materials, and production was not interrupted. Secondly, the loans also promoted the active management of factory owners. Jianye Calcium Carbide Steel Plant, in addition to the loan, also invested new funds and actively sought orders from relevant enterprises such as Jingxi Coal Mine Company in an effort to overcome difficulties. Tongyi Iron Factory originally planned to make one lathe in May. After receiving the loan, with sufficient raw materials and working capital, it actively produced and opened up sales channels, resulting in the production of five lathes, which greatly exceeded the original plan. Jusheng Foundry undertakes the production of waterwheels and kilns for the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, North China Construction Company, and other institutions. It used the loan to install a vertical cupola furnace, which doubled the output and improved the quality. In addition, exporters of urban and rural goods, special handicrafts, fur, and mountain goods were also able to continue their business due to the loans.
    The loan work of the bank in April and May played a significant role in assisting private industrial and commercial enterprises to overcome difficulties. However, due to the difficulty in recovering some loans upon maturity, and the insufficient understanding of the specific situation of each industrial and commercial household by the bank staff, loans are not easily granted even to those who meet the conditions. This problem must be solved from both sides: First, some industrialists and businessmen should correct the idea of ​​relying entirely on loans, and do not regard bank loans as the only way to solve their own difficulties. They must spend their own energy to improve management, so that they can not only increase the guarantee of repayment, but also develop their business. At the same time, they must truthfully fill in loan applications, balance sheets, and repayment plans, so that the People's Bank can confidently lend according to the business conditions of each household. Second, the staff of the bank's offices should also clearly recognize that assisting private enterprises to overcome difficulties is an important task of the state bank at present, and should strive to make their work closely adapt to the needs of the new economic situation, actively and deeply understand the industrial and commercial households applying for loans, and provide timely assistance to private enterprises that meet the loan conditions to solve the difficulties in capital turnover.

　　大力协助有利国计民生的私营企业
    市人民银行两月贷款八十余亿
    因商品滞销一度停工的工厂恢复了生产
    【京市新闻处讯】人民银行北京分行贷款协助有利于国计民生的私营企业克服目前资金周转的困难，四、五两个月共放出贷款八十二亿余元。得到贷款的私营企业，经正当运用、积极经营后，生产业务已能维持，并走向正常发展。
    该行贷款的主要对象是经营机器制造、织染、制革等工业户和从事运销城乡物资、出口贸易等商业户。自物价平稳呈现商品暂时滞销现象以来，四、五两个月里，计分别贷给私营工业三十四亿六千余万元，公私合营工业二十六亿四千余万元，小手工业七千余万元，埠际押汇二亿五千万元，经由中国银行贷给特种手工艺九百余万元、出口订货打包押汇十八亿五千余万元，得到贷款的共有二百余户。贷款额度如按月统计，则超过了以前任何一月的数字。
    贷款的作用，首先是使因商品滞销一度停工的工厂恢复了生产。如敬业皮革厂产品质量较好，有发展前途，但因产品滞销停工一个月，得到贷款七千万元后，购进生皮原料，始恢复了生产。同时也有不少工厂因及时得到贷款而避免了停产，如建国制铁厂为本市唯一制造元铁的工厂，得到贷款两亿元后，补充了大批原料，生产乃未中断。其次，贷款还促进了工厂厂主的积极经营，建业电石铸钢厂就于贷款之外又投入了新资金，广泛向京西煤矿公司等有关企业部门争取承做订货，力谋克服困难；同益铁工厂原计划五月份做一台镟床，得到贷款后，原料和流动资金充足，积极生产，打开销路，结果做出了五台镟床，大大超过原计划；聚盛翻砂厂为水利推进社、华北建筑公司等机关承做水车、片炉，以贷款装设一座立式化铁炉，产量增加两倍，质量也因而提高。此外，运销城乡物资及特种手工艺、皮毛、山货的出口商，也因得到贷款业务得以继续维持。
    该行四、五两月贷款工作对协助私营工商业克服困难，是起了显著作用的。但由于有些贷款到期催收困难，该行工作人员对各工商业户具体情况也不够了解，所以对合乎条件的也不轻易贷款。这问题必须从两方面解决：第一、部分工商业者应纠正完全依赖贷款的想法，不要把银行贷款看成能解决自己困难的唯一办法，必须自己花费气力改进经营，这样，既可增加还款保证，又能发展业务。同时，要真实填写贷款申请书、资产负债表和还款计划，以便人民银行能放手针对各户业务情况进行贷放。第二、该行各办事处工作人员也应明确认识协助私营企业度过难关是国家银行目前一项重要任务，要努力使工作密切适应经济新情势的需要，主动地对申请贷款的工商业户作广泛深入的了解，根据具体情况，对合乎贷款条件的私营企业能做到及时帮助解决资金周转困难的地步。
