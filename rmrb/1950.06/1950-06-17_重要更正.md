　　Important Correction

　　In yesterday's (16th) edition, in the news item "Ministry of Trade Issues Wheat Purchase Instructions," in the "This Newspaper's Report" section, the phrase "North China area slightly lower than East China" should have read "North China area slightly higher than East China." We hereby issue this correction.

　　重要更正
    昨日（十六日）本版“贸易部发布购麦指示”新闻“本报讯”中有“华北区稍低于华东”应为“华北区稍高于华东”。特此更正。
