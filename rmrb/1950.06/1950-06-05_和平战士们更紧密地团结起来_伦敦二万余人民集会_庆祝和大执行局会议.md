    Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: Comprehensive reports from TASS and Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union) messages: London citizens held a mass rally of twenty-five thousand people on June 1st to celebrate the recently held meeting of the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace.

    Men, women, young and old from all walks of life in London came to listen to the speeches of the leaders of the world peace movement, holding countless flags with slogans such as: "Welcome international peace fighters!" and "Strive for friendly understanding between all countries in the world!"

    John Horner, General Secretary of the British Fire Brigade Union, who presided over the meeting, announced to the assembly that 145,000 people in Britain had signed the declaration of the WPC (World Peace Council) and that the signature campaign was continuing.

    Crowther, Chairman of the British Peace Committee, pointed out that half of mankind is already on our side, and if we bring out our strength, we will surely be able to defeat the warmongers.

    When Mrs. Hodinova-Spurna, Vice-Chairman of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, reported that almost all the people of the Czech Republic had participated in the peace signature campaign, the entire audience responded with warm cheers. She said, "If we achieve the goal of banning the atomic bomb, there will be no war."

    Dr. Johnson, the 76-year-old veteran peace fighter and Deputy Dean of Canterbury, said to the audience, who greeted him with a storm of applause: "There is something more powerful than the warmongers, and that is the common people. If they say 'no', war cannot be fought."

    Soviet writer Korneichuk said: "The American warmongers are trying to intimidate the people, but the people are uniting their ranks more closely. Their slogan is courage, courage, and more courage!"

    When the American black singer Robeson stepped onto the podium, the audience spontaneously sang a welcoming song. Robeson sang peace songs from China, the Soviet Union, and the United States and gave a speech stating: The American working class is beginning to realize that they themselves are suffering from the warmongers, that they themselves are losing civil liberties and being thrown into prison, not the people of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries. I will return to the United States to fight for peace.

    伦敦二万余人民集会  庆祝和大执行局会议
    【新华社四日讯】综合塔斯社与电通社消息：伦敦市民在六月一日举行了二万五千人的群众大会，庆祝刚刚举行的世界拥护和平大会常委会执行局会议。
    伦敦各界男女老少都来听世界和平运动领导者们的讲话，他们高举着无数的旗帜，上面写着：“欢迎国际和平斗士！”、“争取世界各国友好谅解！”
    主持大会的英国救火员工会总书记约翰·霍尔纳向大会宣布：英国已有十四万五千人在和大常委会宣言上签了名，签名运动并正在继续进行中。
    英国和平委员会主席克劳瑟指出：全人类已有一半站在我们这一边，假如我们拿出我们的力量来，我们就一定能够战胜战争挑拨者。
    当捷克斯洛伐克国民议会副主席，荷第诺娃——斯普尔纳夫人报告捷克几乎全国人民都已参加和平签名时，全场报以热烈的欢呼。她说：“如果我们达到禁止原子弹的目的，就不会有战争了。”
    英国坎特伯雷副主教——七十六岁的老和平斗士——约翰逊博士向对他发出暴风雨般的掌声的听众说：“天下还有比战争贩子更有力量的东西，那就是老百姓，如果他们说‘不行’，战争就打不起来。”
    苏联作家科尔内楚克说：“美国战争贩子试图恐吓人民，然而，人民却把自己的队伍团结得更紧密。他们的口号是勇敢，勇敢，更勇敢！”
    美国黑人歌唱家罗伯逊登上讲台时，会众自然而然地唱起了欢迎歌。罗伯逊唱了中国、苏联和美国的和平歌曲并发表讲演称：美国工人阶级正在开始领悟到，是他们自己在吃战争贩子的苦头，是他们自己在丧失公民自由、在被投入狱中，而不是苏联、中国和人民民主国家的人民。我将回到美国去为争取和平而斗争。
