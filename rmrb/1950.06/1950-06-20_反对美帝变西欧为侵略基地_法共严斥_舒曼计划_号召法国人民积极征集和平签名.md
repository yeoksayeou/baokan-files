　　Opposing US Imperialism Turning Western Europe into a Base for Aggression
    French Communist Party Sternly Condemns the "Schuman Plan"
    Calls on the French People to Actively Collect Peace Signatures
    [Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 18th] According to TASS, Paris: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party held a meeting on the 16th and passed a resolution, sternly condemning the so-called "Schuman Plan" and calling on the French people to vigorously carry out the peace declaration signature campaign.

    In its resolution, the Political Bureau pointed out: The warmongers are stepping up various preparations for aggression, and the Schuman Plan particularly exposes this fact. The plan emphasizes the intention of American imperialism to turn Western Europe into its main military and economic base on the European continent.

    The Schuman Plan prepares to subordinate France to Bonn Germany, which itself is subordinate to the control of the United States. This plan prepares to de-industrialize France, plunge it into more severe economic stagnation, and lead to increased unemployment and further impoverishment of the French working people. Therefore, the Schuman Plan has aroused increasingly sharp opposition not only among the working class but also among broad social strata.

    The resolution said: It is necessary to vigorously carry out the signature campaign for the Stockholm Declaration. The Political Bureau calls on Communist Party members, in the spirit of the broadest unity, to actively collect signatures for the peace declaration together with peace supporters of various beliefs.

    The Political Bureau protested the military court's conviction of the patriot Raymond Dien and condemned the act of invoking this heinous law to convict him as shameful.

    The Political Bureau exposed the suppression of Communist Party members of parliament Bonté, Rambert, and Siour, and exposed the increasing number of demands to strip Communist Party members of parliament of their parliamentary immunity.

    The Political Bureau emphasized: Under these circumstances, it is necessary to organize support for imprisoned or persecuted peace supporters and to strengthen the mass struggle against repression. These are all aspects of the struggle against the criminal plans of the warmongers.

　　反对美帝变西欧为侵略基地
    法共严斥“舒曼计划” 
    号召法国人民积极征集和平签名
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党政治局十六日举行的会议通过决议，严斥所谓“舒曼计划”，并号召法国人民大力进行和平宣言签名运动。
    政治局在决议中指出：战争贩子正加紧进行各种侵略准备，舒曼计划特别暴露了这一事实。该计划强调了美国帝国主义把西欧变为他们在欧洲大陆的主要军事和经济基地的意图。
    舒曼计划准备使法国从属于波恩德国，而波恩德国本身是从属于美国的支配的。这个计划准备使法国非工业化，使其陷入更严重的经济停滞状态，并招致法国劳动人民失业的增长和进一步的贫困。因此，舒曼计划不仅在工人阶级中，而且在广大的社会各阶层中，引起了日益尖锐的反对。
    决议说：大力进行斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名运动是必要的。政治局号召共产党员以最广泛的团结的精神，和各种信仰不同的和平拥护者一道，积极地为和平宣言征集签名。
    政治局抗议军事法庭对爱国者雷蒙达·第安的判罪，并把援引这种穷凶极恶的法律来判罪的行为斥为可耻。
    政治局揭露对共产党议员邦特、兰柏特与西约尔等人的压制，并揭露日益增多的要求剥夺共产党议员的国会豁免权的事件。
    政治局强调：在这种情况下，必须组织对被监禁的或受迫害的和平拥护者的支援，并加强群众反对镇压的斗争。这些都是反对战争贩子罪恶计划的斗争的一个方面。
