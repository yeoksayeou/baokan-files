Xinhua News Agency, June 14th:

　　Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, issued the following statement on June 13th regarding MacArthur's illegal and violent persecution of the Japanese Communist Party:

　　MacArthur and his lackey, the Yoshida government's, brutal actions of illegally persecuting the Japanese Communist Party blatantly expose the US imperialists' deliberate conspiracy to turn Japan into a US colony and base of aggression. It also fully demonstrates the fear felt by US imperialism towards the growth of the Japanese working class organizations and the unprecedented surge in the peace movement.

　　MacArthur's insane atrocities completely violate the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy documents towards Japan, and are even inconsistent with the so-called new Japanese constitution that he himself supervised. Not only do the Japanese people have the right to resist MacArthur's actions, but the people of the world also have the right to lodge serious protests against MacArthur.

　　We fully sympathize with the Japanese people's just struggle under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party. We believe that no matter how severely MacArthur suppresses them, the Japanese people, united around the Communist Party, will eventually be able to smash the brutal fascist rule of US imperialism and its running dog government and achieve final victory through long-term and arduous struggle.

    马叙伦发表谈话
    斥麦克阿瑟迫害日共
    【新华社十四日讯】中国民主促进会主席马叙伦，十三日为麦克阿瑟非法迫害日本共产党的狂暴行为，发表谈话如下：
    麦克阿瑟及其走狗吉田政府非法迫害日共的狂暴行为，露骨地暴露了美帝国主义蓄意使日本变为美国殖民地和侵略基地的阴谋，也充分表现了美帝对日本工人阶级组织的成长及拥护和平运动的空前高涨所感到的恐惧。
    麦克阿瑟这种疯狂的暴行，完全违反了波茨坦宣言和远东委员会对日基本政策文件的规定，甚至与他自己监制的所谓日本新宪法也不符合。对于这种行为，不但日本人民有权利向麦克阿瑟抗争，全世界人民也有权利向麦克阿瑟提出严重的抗议。
    我们完全同情日本人民在日共领导下的正义的斗争，我们相信，不管麦克阿瑟镇压得如何厉害，日本人民团结在共产党的周围，经过长期艰苦奋斗，最后一定能够粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗政府残暴的法西斯统治，而获得最后的胜利。
