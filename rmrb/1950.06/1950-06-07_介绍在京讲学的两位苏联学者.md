    Currently, he is writing a book called "The Soviet Socialist State," which is expected to be completed in 1951. He is also leading a collective compilation project, which is the creation of "A History of Russian Philosophy." The work of compiling "A History of Russian Philosophy" is scheduled to be completed in 1951.

    Legal Scholar Askelov

He graduated in 1930. From 1930 to 1931, he served as a special envoy assisting the countryside in cities, working in a regional Soviet in western Siberia. After returning to Moscow, he worked as a teacher in institutions of higher education, led work in a district Soviet in Moscow, and worked in the Organizational Department of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. Since 1938, he has been fully engaged in scientific research and teaching at the Institute of Law of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Moscow University, presiding over the National Law Lecture at the university and serving as Deputy Director of the Faculty of Law. He has authored more than forty scientific works on Soviet state law and Soviet construction.

    In July 1941, he voluntarily went to the front to participate in the Great Patriotic War. He was wounded and disabled in the battle against the Hitlerite bandits. In 1942, he returned to his academic post and worked with excellence, receiving multiple awards, including the "Bravery" Medal. He is currently a lecturer at the Advanced Party School of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party.
