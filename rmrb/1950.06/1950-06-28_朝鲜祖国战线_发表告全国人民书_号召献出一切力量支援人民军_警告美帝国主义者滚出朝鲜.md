Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 27th: The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front held a meeting on the eve of the first anniversary of the founding of the Fatherland Front (June 27th). After discussing the emergency situation caused by the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang's initiation of civil war, the meeting unanimously passed a letter to the entire nation. The letter pointed out that the Fatherland Front's two proposals for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland over the past year reflected the will of all patriotic political parties, social organizations, and the people of both North and South Korea. However, the Li Chengwan bandit gang, under the direction of American imperialism, has answered our peaceful reunification proposal by launching a civil war of fratricide. The Korean people have been forced to rise up and resist the adventurous attack of the Li Chengwan bandit gang. The letter continued: The Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front fully supports the measure of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to order the People's Army to eliminate the enemies who launched the civil war, and fully supports the appeal made by General Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Republic, to the people of the whole country in his radio address on the 26th. The letter to the people calls on the nation's democratic political parties, social organizations, and people to rise up and participate in the struggle to defend the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its Constitution, in order to liberate the compatriots of South Korea from the fascist rule of the Li Chengwan bandit gang. The letter calls on the people of the whole country to dedicate all their strength to support the heroic People's Army. The letter emphatically points out in conclusion: The American imperialists, panic-stricken by the victory of the Korean People's Army, are taking emergency measures in a vain attempt to save the Li Chengwan bandit gang from destruction, who frantically launched the civil war under their direction. The entire Korean people solemnly warn the American imperialists, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Korean people, to get out of our fatherland immediately!
