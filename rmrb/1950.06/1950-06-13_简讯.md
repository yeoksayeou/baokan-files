    Telecommunications Directorate Stipulates Measures to Prevent Telephone Lines from Touching Power Lines
    Due to the irresponsibility of employees and the failure to follow regulations during construction, the Songjiang Telecommunications Bureau of East China caused broken telephone lines to come into contact with electric light wires, resulting in two major incidents of electrocution (details in the May 23rd issue of this newspaper, page 2). To avoid similar incidents, the Telecommunications Directorate of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government issued a notice in early May, making eight clear stipulations regarding the prevention of telephone lines from touching power lines. It also called on all bureaus to pay serious attention to and be vigilant about the aforementioned unfortunate incidents, eliminate complacency, demonstrate a high sense of responsibility, and conscientiously implement these regulations.

    Hunan Conducts Warehouse Inventory, Corrects Numerous Wasteful Practices
    Hunan Province is currently conducting warehouse inventory work throughout the region. According to incomplete statistics, several units under the Provincial Highway Bureau have already cleared out materials worth approximately 6 billion RMB. This includes over 5,700 tons of machine parts such as lathes, planers, diesel engines, steam engines, and engines. The Changsha Telecommunications Bureau has also cleared out over 500 tons of discarded equipment. During the inventory process, it was discovered that large quantities of complete equipment, or equipment that only required minor repairs for application, had been discarded, while many units were purchasing materials from the market with cash. After the inventory, this phenomenon was finally corrected. For example, 80% of the materials previously scrapped by the Hengyang Transportation Branch Maintenance Yard of the Provincial Highway Bureau can now be utilized, worth approximately 1 billion RMB. The Changsha Automobile Repair Factory cleared out over 50 tons of steel and iron materials, all of which can be used as raw materials. The Changsha Telecommunications Bureau used broken parts from Morse machines to make oscillators for wired telegraphs, and broken, lightweight yellow braided wire to make two-core plug cords for switchboards, not only saving the state's financial expenditure but also solving many difficulties in the current supply of equipment. The inventory also revealed serious waste in certain units. For example, before the investigation, over 90% of the family members of employees at the Zhuzhou Xia She Si Power Plant each had an electric stove. After correction, it is estimated that the monthly electricity savings can supply Zhuzhou for two months.
    Handan Region Clears Warehouses, Wu'an Discovers Machinery
    Under the attention of leading cadres and the efforts of staff, the Handan Region's Handan Town and Wu'an County have cleared out a large number of materials during warehouse inventory work. In Handan Town, over 70 units including government agencies, organizations, and state-owned enterprises, after study and mobilization, have all joined the warehouse inventory upsurge, with the exception of a few departments. Among them, Yuhua and Zhenhua have done a better job, clearing out some broken glass, pig iron, and wrought iron that others considered worthless, valued at 2.2 million RMB. In addition, the Native Produce Company cleared out over 170 kinds of mountain goods and medicinal materials, valued at over 580 million RMB, and there are many other appliances. In Wu'an County, after focusing on the inventory, a large number of machines, munitions, telecommunications equipment, etc., have been initially discovered. For example, Chengguan found a cotton gin, 20 cotton ginning carts, and 192 other pieces of equipment. Districts Seven and Nine found a heavy artillery gun, 20 mortars, two steel rails, a set of machine belts, and various office supplies. This shows that there are quite a few pieces of equipment and materials scattered in various places, and all localities should earnestly do this work well.

    电信总局规定办法  防止话线电线相碰
    华东区松江电信局因员工工作不负责任，施工不按规章，致折断的电话线与电灯线相碰，先后发生两次电毙人命的重大事件（详情见五月二十三日本报二版）。为了避免类似事件发生，中央人民政府邮电部电信总局特于五月上旬发出通告。对防止话线与电力线相碰事项，作了八条明确规定。并号召各局对上述不幸事件，引起严重的注意和警惕，消灭麻痹思想，发挥高度的责任心，认真执行该项规定。

    湖南进行清理仓库  纠正不少浪费现象
    湖南省各地正进行清理仓库工作。据不完全统计，省公路局所属若干单位已清出约值人民币六十余亿元的物资。其中包括车床、刨床、柴油机、蒸汽机、引擎等机件共五千七百余吨。长沙电讯局亦清出废旧器材五百余吨。清理中发现过去有大批完整及只须稍加改修即可应用的器材被弃置，而好些单位却又以现金从市面购进材料。经过清点后，这一现象终被纠正。如省公路局衡阳运输分公司保养场过去报废的物料现有百分之八十可予利用，约值人民币十亿元。长沙汽车修配厂清点出钢料、铁料五十余吨，均可作原料用。长沙电讯局利用莫尔斯机上的坏零件，做成有线电报上的振荡器，坏的轻磅黄色被复线做成交换机上的二心塞绳等，不仅节省了国家的财政支出，而且解决了目前器材供应上的许多困难。清点中也发现了某些单位存在着严重的浪费现象。如株州下摄司电厂百分之九十以上的职工眷属在清查前每家都有一只电炉。经纠正后，估计每月节省电力可供株州两月之用。
    邯郸专区清仓  武安查出机器
    邯郸专区邯郸镇、武安县清理仓库工作，在领导干部的重视及职工的努力下，已清查出大批物资。邯郸镇各机关、团体、国营企业共七十余单位，经过学习动员，除个别部门外，均已卷入清理仓库热潮。其中裕华、振华做得较好，将一些别人认为不值钱的碎玻璃、生熟铁等均清理出来，计值二百二十万元。另土产公司清点出山货、药材共一百七十多样，计值五亿八千多万元，尚有其他器具甚多。武安县经重点进行清点结果，已初步查出大批机器、军火、电讯器材等。如城关查出轧花机一部，轧花车二十辆及其他器材一百九十二件。七、九区查出重炮一门，迫击炮二十门，钢轨二条，机器轮带一付及办公用具多种。足见散置各地的器材、物资不在少数，各地应认真做好这一项工作。
