　　To Get Iron Reinforcements to Blast the Water Tower
    Qiqihar Railway Bureau Should Examine its Departmentalism
    The Qiqihar Railway Bureau planned to construct a water tower at the Baokang water supply station on the Ping (Siping) Qi (Qiqihar) line this year. The Qiqihar Railway Bureau sent seven cars of equipment and materials (including two cars of bracing poles, three cars of sleepers, and two cars of iron wire and other equipment). It also built five warehouses to store the equipment inside Baokang Station. To build these warehouses, it bought 500,000 yuan worth of sorghum stalks locally. When everything was ready, the railway bureau's newspaper announced that Baokang Station had been assigned to the Jinzhou Railway Bureau. As a result, the Qiqihar Railway Bureau immediately transported the seven cars of materials back, demolished the warehouses, and sold the 500,000 yuan worth of sorghum stalks for 150,000 yuan. They also used explosives to shatter the original broken water tower, with the aim of extracting the iron reinforcements inside. Eight liang of explosives were used the first time; eight and a half liang the second time; and one jin and three liang the third time. Most of the glass in the station's buildings was shattered by the blasts. Now they have completely shattered the broken water tower and taken all the iron reinforcements. They also wanted to take the cover plate from the water source well at Baokang Station. Only after repeated objections from the workers did they leave it behind.
    This incident shows how serious the departmentalism of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau is. It has caused a great waste of state assets and created a bad influence among the masses. The Qiqihar Railway Bureau should make a profound self-criticism. We also hope that the Northeast Railway General Bureau will investigate this kind of behavior.

　　要取铁筋炸水塔
    齐齐哈尔路局应该检讨本位主义思想
    齐齐哈尔铁路局本年度在平（四平）齐（齐齐哈尔）线保康给水所计划建筑水塔工程，由齐齐哈尔路局发来七车用具及材料（包括绑架杆子二车、枕木三车、铁丝及其他器材二车）。并于保康站内盖了储藏器材的仓库五间。为了盖这所房子，曾在当地买了五十万元的秫秸。一切工作都准备好了的时候，铁路局报纸上公布了保康站划归锦州铁路局的消息。于是齐齐哈尔路局马上把这七车材料运回去，又把这一座房子拆了，将五十万元买的秫秸以十五万元的价钱出卖了。并用炸药将原有的破水塔炸碎，目的是要取里边的铁筋。第一次下了八两炸药；第二次八两半；第三次下了一斤三两。站内房舍的玻璃大部被震坏。现在他们已将整个破水塔炸碎了，把铁筋全部拿走。他们还要把保康站的水源井上的盖板拿走。经工友们再三提意见，才把它留下了。
    这一事件说明了齐齐哈尔铁路局的本位主义是何等严重，使国家的资财受到了很大的浪费，并在群众中造成恶劣的影响。齐齐哈尔铁路局应作深刻检讨。我们并希望东北铁路总局对此种行为加以检查。
