　　Living in the Mao Zedong Era
　　Reyihan 作  Tohutibahai 译

　　I am a twelve-year-old Uyghur boy, a junior high school student from Xinjiang. This time, I and my classmate Patiman (a ten-year-old Kazakh boy) participated in the Beijing National Young Pioneers Cadre Conference.

　　In the past, could two Xinjiang minority teenagers, aged ten and twelve, be looked up to? Today, we are able to participate in a conference in the people's capital—Beijing. This is a historically significant event.

　　In Beijing, we met thousands of young friends from all over the country. They were so kind and caring to us. They warmly welcomed us, making us feel extremely honored and happy. They are like the fragrance of flowers in a garden, attracting and encouraging us. We not only learned a lot but also felt the warmth and loveliness of the democratic New China's big family.

　　During our short time living together with young friends from all over the country, we learned a lot of new knowledge. They took us to visit schools and factories, and taught us songs. We also taught them our ethnic dances and folk songs. What made us feel most honored was that we also met our leader, Chairman Mao.

　　Undoubtedly, these blessings can only be obtained in the era of Mao Zedong.

　　We will convey this learning experience to the children in remote areas, so that they understand the care and respect that the big brother—the Han nationality—and other nationalities have for our minority nationalities.

　　生活在毛泽东时代
    热衣汗  作  托乎提巴海  译
    我是一个维吾尔族少年，今年十二岁，是新疆的一个初中学生。我这次和同学怕提满（哈沙克少年，十岁），参加了北京全国少年儿童队干部会议。
    我们两个十岁和十二岁的新疆少数民族少年，在过去还能被人瞧得起吗？今天我们能够到人民首都——北京参加会议，这是一件具有历史意义的大事。
    我们在北京和全国各地成千的少年朋友们会面了。他们对我们是那样地亲切关怀。他们热烈地欢迎我们，使我们感到极大的荣幸和愉快。他们对于我们，好像是花园里的鲜花之香吸引着我们，鼓励着我们。我们不但学到了很多东西，同时还感到了民主新中国大家庭的温暖可爱。
    在和全国各地少年朋友短期的共同生活中，我们学到了很多新的知识。他们带我们参观学校、工厂，教我们唱歌儿。我们也教他们本民族的舞蹈、歌谣。最使我们感到荣幸的，我们还见了自己的领袖毛主席。
    无疑地，这些幸福只有在毛泽东的年代里才能得到。
    我们要把这一次的学习经验，向边远地区的小朋友传达，使他们了解老大哥——汉族及其他民族对我们少数民族的关怀和尊敬。
