　　Over 300 Private Coal Mines in Hebei Province
    Safety Equipment Extremely Poor
    Local Governments and Mining Bureaus Should Strictly Inspect Them
    [Our newspaper, Baoding] There are 305 private coal mines in Hebei Province, with a total daily output of 2,500 tons. The capitalists' viewpoint of purely seeking profit is very strong. Most of the equipment is substandard, which greatly threatens the safety and health of more than 9,300 workers.

　　In various mines, the pillars and roof supports underground are not neatly arranged, are uneven in size, and their density does not meet specifications, posing a danger of collapse when there is vibration. In the Dong Mine in Fangshan, some old tunnels were not reinforced with pillars and roof supports after being mined out. The intersections of the haulage roadways are wide and have not been reinforced with four-corner pillars. The largest diameter of the general pillars is no more than five inches, creating serious dangers at the coal mining sites. Most mines rely on natural ventilation. To deceive the workers, a saying prevails in the small mines: "There are natural mountain vents in the pit," so the capitalists do not build air ducts. In various mines in Wanping, the wind direction underground is very chaotic, with no fixed air inlet and outlet, so the air underground is very bad. All mines use manual drainage. The drainage ditches are not repaired, and the equipment is insufficient, resulting in a lot of accumulated water. Workers do not have water shoe equipment and walk barefoot, so many suffer from swollen feet. There are no toilet facilities underground, causing workers to defecate everywhere, even mixed in with the coal. Most of the above-ground facilities do not have worker dormitories and rest rooms. Some workers have to walk more than ten miles home to rest after work, making them very tired. In addition, the feudal headman system still exists seriously, and the headmen continue to carry out economic exploitation and feudal rule over the workers. Most coal mines have working hours of up to twelve hours, and wages are mostly based on piece rates, but the phenomenon of wage arrears is very serious. For example, the Fangshan Mine has not paid wages for two months. To protect the safety of workers, local governments and mining bureaus should strictly inspect the private coal mines and urge them to improve as soon as possible.

　　河北省三百余私营煤矿
    安全设备非常恶劣         
    各地政府及矿务局应严加检查
    【本报保定讯】河北省三百零五个私营煤矿，日产量共二千五百吨，资方单纯盈利观点非常浓厚，大多设备不良，因而九千三百多工人的安全和卫生受到了很大威胁。
    各矿井下支柱顶棚不整齐，大小不均匀，稀密不合规格，遇有震力即有倒塌危险。房山东矿有些老塘采空后未加支柱顶棚，顺槽交叉处面积宽阔也未加四角支柱，一般支柱最大也不过五寸直径，造成采煤地点严重的危险性。各矿多系自然通风。为蒙蔽工人，各小矿流行一种说法：“坑内自然有山缝风”，因而资方不去建设风道。宛平各矿井下风向很乱，没有一定出入风口，因而井下空气很坏。各矿井都用人力排水，排水沟不加修理，设备又不够，以致积水很多。工人没有水鞋设备，光脚行走，因而患脚肿的很多。井下并无屎箱设备，致工人到处拉屎，甚至混在煤内。井上大部没有工人宿舍和休息室，工人下班后有的要走十几里地回家去休息，因而非常疲劳。此外封建把头制度还严重存在，把头继续对工人实行经济剥削和封建统治。大部煤矿工作时间达十二小时，工资多为计件制，但拖欠工资现象非常严重，如房山矿已有两个月未发工资。为保护工人安全，各地政府及矿务局应严格检查各私营煤矿并督促其尽速改进。
