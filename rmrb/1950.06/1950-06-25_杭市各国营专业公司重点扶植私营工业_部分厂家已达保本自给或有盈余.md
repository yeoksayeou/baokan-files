　　Hangzhou State-Owned Specialized Companies Focus on Supporting Private Industry; Some Factories Have Reached Break-Even or are Profitable
    [Hangzhou News] Zhejiang Daily News: In the past few months, various state-owned specialized companies in Hangzhou have, in the spirit of considering both public and private interests, provided substantial support to private industries in the province through methods such as commissioned processing, ordering, and purchasing, with a focus on key areas. In May alone, private factories were commissioned to spin 1,175 bales of cotton yarn, weave 26,700 bolts of cotton cloth, reel 830 piculs of raw silk, weave 5,000 bolts of silk fabric, and process 43 million jin of Grade 92 standard rice, with a total value of processing fees amounting to 7.9348 billion yuan. The department store purchased local cloth, undershirts, rubber shoes, toothbrushes, towels, soap, matches, silk quilt covers, and other goods through orders, with a total value of 6.002 billion yuan. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company also purchased 1,078 piculs of cotton, 33 bales and 33 packages of cotton yarn, and 3,133 bolts of cotton cloth. After receiving support in raw material supply and capital turnover, some factories actively engaged in labor-management consultations, reorganized their institutions, improved management, and changed their production policies to overcome temporary difficulties, gradually improving their production and business situation. For example, Hangzhou No. 1 Cotton Mill has gone from losing money to breaking even, and from breaking even to making a profit; Chang'an Cotton Mill is currently able to balance its income and expenditure. However, some factories, despite receiving support, have not changed their old ways of operation, resulting in frequent violations of contract stipulations, shoddy workmanship, and delays in delivery, which not only cause significant losses to the state but are also extremely detrimental to these private factories themselves. This must be overcome in the future. This is extremely detrimental to these private factories themselves, and this must be overcome in the future.

　　杭市各国营专业公司重点扶植私营工业
    部分厂家已达保本自给或有盈余
    【杭州讯】浙江日报消息：杭州市各国营专业公司在过去数月中，曾本公私兼顾精神，以委托加工、订货与收购等方式，对本省私营工业有重点的给予相当扶助。仅五月份，就委托私营工厂代纺棉纱一千一百七十五件，代织棉布二万六千七百匹，代缫生丝八百三十关担，代织绸缎五千匹，加工九二标准米四千三百万斤，共付工缴总值七十九亿三千四百八十余万元。百货公司以定货方式收购的布匹（当地土布）、汗衫、胶鞋、牙刷、毛巾、肥皂、火柴、绸被面等，共值六十亿零二千万元。花纱布公司并收购了棉花一千零七十八担，棉纱三十三件三十三包，棉布三千一百三十三匹。在得到原料供给及资金周转的扶助之后，部分厂家即积极进行劳资协商、整理机构改善管理，转变生产方针，克服暂时困难，使生产及营业情况渐趋好转。如杭州第一纱厂已由亏本到保本，由保本到盈余；长安纱厂目前收支亦可平衡。惟部分厂家虽经扶助，依旧未改变老一套经营方针，以致常有违反合同规定，粗制滥造，延误交货时间等违约情形发生，不但使国家遭受重大损失，对这些私营工厂本身也极端不利，这是必须在今后注意克服的。本身也极端不利，这是必须在今后注意克服的。
