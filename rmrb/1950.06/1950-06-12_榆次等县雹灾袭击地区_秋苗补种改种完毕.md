　　Yuci and Other Counties Hit by Hailstorms
　　Autumn Seedlings Have Been Replanted and Resown
    [This newspaper Yuci News] More than 33,000 mu of wheat fields and autumn seedlings destroyed by hailstorms in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, have been mostly replanted and resown. Yuci County suffered three hailstorms in mid-to-late May, the most severe being on May 25th, destroying a total of 33,682 mu of wheat fields and autumn seedlings. After the disaster, reactionary landlords and illegal secret societies took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage. After the hailstorm, Zhang Weirong, Secretary of the Yuci County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and six others formed a work team to go to the disaster areas to express sympathy and organize and lead the affected masses to replant and resow. On the one hand, the relief grain allocated by the Commissioner's Office was quickly distributed to the most severely affected villages to help the victims solve the problem of lack of means of production; on the other hand, emergency meetings of village cadres in the affected villages were held to promptly correct the cadres' paralysis and waiting mentality, calling on Party members and cadres to take the lead in organizing the masses to carry out emergency planting; at the same time, the special agents' rumors and sabotage were more forcefully exposed. After organization and mobilization, men and women, young and old, in the affected villages were all mobilized to carry out resowing and replanting. As of June 1st, according to reports from 25 villages including Wang Du, more than 23,000 mu of wheat fields and autumn seedlings affected by the disaster have been successfully replanted and resown.

    [This newspaper Qingyuan News] Kong Village in the third district of Qingyuan County, Shanxi Province, has completed the replanting task in six days. On May 25th, the village suffered hailstorms that destroyed 1,400 mu of wheat fields and autumn seedlings (including 500 mu of wheat). After six days of intensive work from May 31st to June 5th, in addition to completing the replanting task of 1,400 mu, 900 mu of unplanted autumn land were also rushed to be planted.
    [This newspaper Huguan News] Huguan County in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, suffered a hailstorm on May 25th. All 420 mu of wheat in Hancun Village, District One, were generally damaged by the hailstorm. Under the active leadership of county and district cadres, 130 men, women, and children in the entire village were mobilized and organized to carry out replanting and resowing. In just two days, May 30th and 31st, 152 mu were replanted, 110 mu of wheat were harvested, 22 mu were plowed, and 19 mu were resown. The village cooperative used porcelain to exchange early-maturing crop seeds (60-day jade corn, beans, grains, etc.) for more than two dan from other villages, solving the problem of seed shortage for the masses. Now the masses in the entire village have proposed to strive to complete the replanting and resowing within eight days.
