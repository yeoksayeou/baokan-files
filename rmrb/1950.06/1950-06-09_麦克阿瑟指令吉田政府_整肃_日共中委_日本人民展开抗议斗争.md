Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the American Occupation Forces in Japan, has increasingly betrayed the Potsdam Declaration's provisions regarding the encouragement of democratic forces in Japan. He openly issued a directive on the 6th to the reactionary Japanese government to "purge" all twenty-four members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, prohibiting them from engaging in any political activities.

According to Tokyo sources: In order to further implement the plan to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal, MacArthur sent a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida on the 6th. After maliciously slandering the Japanese Communist Party, the loyal defender of Japan's independence, democracy, and peace, he ordered Yoshida, saying: "I direct your government to take the necessary administrative measures to remove and exclude all members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party from public office and to subject them to all prohibitions, restrictions, and constraints of the directives I issued on January 4, 1946 (i.e., the "Purge Order") and its supplementary decrees."

According to the Associated Press: As a result of the illegal "purge" of the twenty-four members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party by the American and Japanese reactionaries, according to MacArthur's instruction this time, they were all "prohibited from holding public office," "prohibited from having any party affiliation, or engaging in any public political activity," and even "they shall also be prohibited from occupying positions of power in other activities." Their six seats in the House of Representatives and one seat in the House of Councillors newly elected on June 4 were also unreasonably canceled.

After receiving the instructions from its master MacArthur, the reactionary Japanese government immediately held a cabinet meeting on the same day and decided to comply with the instructions and "implement the purge immediately." At the same time, under MacArthur's direct instructions, the Yoshida government is accelerating plans to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal. According to a Reuters report, Katsuo Okazaki, Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Yoshida Cabinet, openly stated as early as the 5th that "the bill to declare the Communist Party illegal may be earlier than expected" because "MacArthur Headquarters has reached an understanding with the Washington authorities on this issue." A Kyodo News Agency dispatch on the 7th also revealed that the Yoshida government will more quickly concretize legislation to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal. Toshikichi Ushita, Director-General of the Legal Affairs Agency, bluntly stated on the 6th that the Yoshida government's anti-communist bill will take the U.S.'s McCarran Act and Australia's anti-communist bill "as important references."

Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: The Japanese people have protested the outrageous actions of the American and Japanese reactionaries in illegally "purging" all twenty-four members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 6th: The All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee has protested against the "Purge Order." The protest pointed out: This "Purge Order" is "clear evidence of the imperialist conspiracy and trick of the Yoshida government to declare the Communist Party illegal." According to Kyodo News Agency, the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee issued a statement on the 5th regarding the Yoshida government's attempt to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal, stating: The All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee will organize a broad mass movement to fight against the imperialists who declare the Communist Party illegal, destroy the reactionary forces, and strive for peace and national independence.

According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo: The Japan Federation of Industrial Organizations (Sanbetsu) announced on the 7th that one million Japanese workers will go on strike in the next two or three days to protest the illegal "purge" of all members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party by the American and Japanese reactionaries. Sanbetsu also stated that more than 270,000 workers had laid down their tools since June 3rd; representatives of 65 progressive trade unions held a meeting on the same day and decided to hold a general strike in due course.

According to a United Press report on the 6th: People in Fukuoka, Kyushu, held a mass rally to protest MacArthur's directive to "purge" the Central Committee members of the Japanese Communist Party. Communists delivered speeches at the rally, stating that the directive was a dictatorial directive that would lead Japan to destruction. The speakers pointed out: This is as malicious as the measures taken by the Japanese militarist government in 1928 to suppress the Communist Party.

The All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations also held a central meeting on the night of the 6th and unanimously decided to protest and struggle against the measures taken by the American and Japanese reactionaries to suppress the Japanese Communist Party. Students at Tokyo University distributed leaflets on the 6th, protesting MacArthur's suppression measures and calling on students from all over the country to go on strike.

The American and Japanese reactionaries are preparing to implement bloody suppression of the movement launched by the Japanese people to protest this atrocity. Okazaki Katsuo declared on the 6th that the Yoshida government "is prepared to use the police to suppress strikes or slowdowns held to protest the purge of twenty-four senior communists." (Reuters) According to Kyodo News Agency, the National Local Police Headquarters of the Yoshida government held an emergency meeting of senior officials on the 6th to prepare for the occurrence of "unexpected events" and issued instructions to the police headquarters of each prefecture, prefecture, and prefecture to "strengthen security." Prior to this, the Tokyo Police Department, which had prohibited the people of Tokyo from holding gatherings and demonstrations before the 5th, issued a new ban on the 5th, stating: "For a considerable period of time," "regardless of the purpose, all marches and demonstrations shall not be held."

　　麦克阿瑟指令吉田政府“整肃”日共中委
    日本人民展开抗议斗争
    百万工人将在近两三天内举行大罢工
    东京大学学生号召全日各地同学罢课
    【新华社八日讯】美国驻日本占领军统帅麦克阿瑟，变本加厉地背弃波茨坦宣言关于鼓励日本民主势力的规定，公然在六日指令日本反动政府“整肃”日本共产党中央委员会全体二十四名委员，禁止他们从事一切政治活动。
    据东京消息：麦克阿瑟为了进一步实行宣布日共为非法的计划，于六日致函日本首相吉田茂，对日本的独立、民主与和平的忠贞保卫者——日本共产党，作了恶毒的诬蔑以后，即命令吉田称：“我指令你的政府采取必要的行政措施，撤除并摈斥日本共产党中央委员会的全体委员的公职，并使他们服从我在一九四六年一月四日所发出的指令（按即“整肃令”）及其补充法令的各项禁令、限制与约束。”
    据美联社透露：根据麦克阿瑟这次的指令，日共二十四名中央委员被美、日反动派非法“整肃”的结果，他们都被“禁止担任公共职务”，“禁止有任何党籍，或从事任何公开的政治活动”，甚至“他们还要被禁止在其他活动中占据有势力的地位”。他们中的六个众议员职位及六月四日新当选的一个参议员职位，也被无理地取消。
    日本反动政府在接到其主子麦克阿瑟的指令后，立即于当日召开内阁会议，决定遵照指令，“即日实施整肃”。同时，吉田政府在麦克阿瑟的直接指使下，正在加速筹划宣布日共为非法。据路透社讯，吉田内阁书记长官冈崎胜男早在五日就公开声称：“宣布共产党为非法的法案，可能较预料者为早”，因为“麦克阿瑟总部已经和华盛顿当局就此问题获致谅解”。共同社七日电亦透露：吉田政府对宣布日共为非法的立法，将更迅速地具体化。法务总裁殖田俊吉六日露骨地表示：吉田政府的反共法案，将以美国的蒙特法案和澳大利亚的反共法案“作为重要参考”。
    【新华社八日讯】日本人民纷纷抗议美、日反动派非法“整肃”日本共产党全体二十四名中央委员的疯狂行动。据美联社东京六日讯：全日工会联络委员会已对该“整肃令”提出抗议。抗议指出：这个“整肃令”是吉田“政府要宣布共产党为非法的帝国主义阴谋和诡计的明证”。另据共同社消息：全日工会联络委员会曾于五日对吉田政府企图宣布日共为非法的阴谋发表声明称：全日工会联络委员会对于宣布共产党为非法的帝国主义者，将组织起广大的群众，展开斗争，摧毁反动势力，争取和平与民族独立。
    据法新社东京讯：日本产业工会联合会（产联）七日宣称：一百万日本工人将在两三天内举行罢工，以抗议美日反动派非法“整肃”日共中央委员会全体委员。产联并称：二十七万多工人已自六月三日起放下他们的工具；六十五个进步工会的代表并于同日举行会议，决定在相当时期举行总罢工。
    又据合众社六日讯：九州福冈人民举行了群众大会，抗议麦克阿瑟“整肃”日共中央委员的指令。共产党员在大会上发表演说称：这个指令是独裁的指令，它将把日本导向毁灭。演说者指出：这和一九二八年日本军国主义政府镇压共产党的措施同样的恶毒。
    全日学生自治会联合会亦于六日夜召开中央会议，一致决议对美、日反动派镇压日共的措施进行抗议斗争。东京大学学生在六日散发传单，抗议麦克阿瑟的镇压措施，并号召各地同学举行罢课。
    美、日反动派对于日本人民所掀起的抗议这一暴行的运动，正准备实行血腥的弹压。冈崎胜男六日即宣称，吉田政府“已准备使用警察来弹压抗议整肃二十四名高级共产党人而举行的罢工或怠工”。（路透社）另据共同社消息：吉田政府国家地方警察本部为了准备对付“不测事态”的发生，六日已举行高级人员紧急会议，并向各都、道、府、县警察本部发出“加强警备”的指令。在此以前，曾禁止东京人民在五日以前举行集会和示威游行的东京警察局，五日发出新禁令称：“在相当期间内”，“无论目的何在，凡是游行及示威运动，均不得举行”。
