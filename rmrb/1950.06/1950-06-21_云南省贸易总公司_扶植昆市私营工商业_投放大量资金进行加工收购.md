　　【Kunming News】 Yunnan Daily news: The Yunnan Provincial Trade Corporation Preparatory Office is vigorously supporting Kunming's private factories and businesses through the acquisition of products and commissioned processing, enabling them to maintain and restore production. The financial difficulties of various manufacturers have also been gradually resolved.

　　From March to early May, the office acquired 8,830 sima dan (one sima dan equals 121 jin) of cotton from cotton merchants. It also signed contracts with 18 cotton transport and sales companies, including Maoheng, Yongchangxiang, Yongmaohe, Wanchun, and Chengchang, to purchase 9,170 sima dan of cotton from abroad. The contracts resolved 50% to 60% of the foreign exchange difficulties for each business. In addition, the office acquired over 9,000 bolts of homespun cloth and over 2,000 bolts of locally produced foreign cloth, and helped to promote the sale of homespun cloth to rural areas. The local foreign cloth, however, was experiencing sluggish sales because manufacturers were not striving for progress and the colors of the cloth were not suitable for the needs of the vast rural areas. After the company pointed this out, gradual improvements have been made.

　　During the same period, the company's department store division has signed contracts with 135 private manufacturers in knitwear, hardware, electrical materials, and stationery through acquisitions and processing, and helped to solve raw material problems. The capital invested in supporting private enterprises amounted to over 4 billion yuan, of which 78% was directly through acquisitions and orders. The acquisition of soap alone reached 20,000 boxes, taking care of the livelihoods of over 2,000 employees.

　　In terms of local products, the planned acquisition of hog bristles, American tobacco leaves, tin, feathers, leather, tung oil and other vegetable oils, casings, deerskin, and silk floss has also helped some manufacturers solve problems such as poor capital turnover and sluggish sales. For example, before the acquisition of hog bristles, more than 40 manufacturers had stopped work. After the acquisition, more than 30 have resumed work and have made improvements in reducing costs and improving quality.

    扶植昆市私营工商业
    投放大量资金进行加工收购
    【昆明讯】云南日报消息：云南省贸易总公司筹备处，通过收购产品与委托加工等方式，大力扶植昆市私营厂商，使能维持与恢复生产，各厂商在资金周转方面的困难也逐步得到了解决。
    该处从三月份到五月上旬为止，收购了花商棉花八千八百三十个司马担（一个司马担合一百二十一市斤），又和棉花运销商茂恒、永昌祥、永茂和、万春、成昌等十八家订立了合同，由国外采购棉花九千一百七十个司马担。在合同中，替各商号解决了百分之五十至六十的外汇困难。此外，该处又收购了土布九千多匹，当地染织业出品洋布二千多匹，并帮助把土布推销到农村去。又当地洋布，因厂家不求进步，布匹颜色又不能适合广大农村的需要，以致造成滞销。后经公司指出后，已逐步有了改进。
    该公司百货部门，在同时期内，已通过收购、加工等方式，分别与针织、五金、电料器材、文具等一百三十五个私营厂家订立合同，并帮助解决了原料问题。投放在扶植私营企业上的资金达四十多亿元，其中直接通过收购、订货者占百分之七十八，单肥皂一项即收购达二万箱，照顾了两千多职工的生活。
    土产方面，由于有计划地收购猪鬃、美种烟叶、大锡、羽毛、皮革、桐油及其他植物油、肠衣、鹿皮、丝棉等物，也帮助了一些厂商解决了资金周转不灵及销路呆滞等困难。如猪鬃业在未收购前，四十多厂商都停了工，经收购后，已有三十余家复工，并在降低成本、提高质量方面有了改进。
