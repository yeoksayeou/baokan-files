    Beijing News Agency Report: Since the People's Bank of China's Beijing Branch implemented cash management for municipal-level agencies, troops, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives on May 8th, initial results have been achieved. First, the cash on hand of most agencies (including troops, enterprises, and cooperatives, the same below) has decreased, and bank deposits have increased, strengthening the state banks' ability to concentrate capital. Since the bank convened a symposium of major municipal-level units on May 8th to implement cash management, bank deposits have increased daily. By May 31st, agency deposits had increased by nearly 90% compared to May 8th. On the other hand, the number of inter-agency fund transfers through banks has also increased, and cash payments have decreased. Before the implementation of cash management at the end of April, the number of deposit transfers was only equivalent to four and a half times the cash receipts and payments. By the end of May, the number of transfers had reached six times the cash receipts and payments, reducing the circulation of cash and making it more conducive to the stability of finance and prices and to supporting production. However, due to the bank's lack of experience in this new business, there are still many shortcomings in the work. It lacks inspection as to whether all agencies have established relationships with banks, whether they have retained cash as required, and what difficulties exist in the implementation and how to solve them. In addition, many accounting officers of agencies do not have sufficient understanding of cash management. Starting from departmentalism, they have ideological resistance, fearing trouble, worrying about restrictions on withdrawals, or using the excuse of not receiving instructions from higher levels to take a perfunctory attitude towards the bank, which needs to be resolutely corrected.

    京市现金流通量减少
    国家银行集中使用资金力量增强
    银行与各机关尚须认真执行现金管理决定
    【京市新闻处讯】人民银行北京分行自五月八日对市级机关、部队、公营企业、合作社实施现金管理以来，已收到初步效果。首先，多数机关（包括部队、企业、合作社，下同）库存现金减少，银行存款增多，增强了国家银行集中使用资金的力量，该行自五月八日召集市级各主要单位座谈，实施现金管理后，银行存款即逐日增加，到五月三十一日止，机关存款较五月八日增加近百分之九十；另一方面，各机关之间款项往来通过银行转账的数字也增多，现金支付减少，四月底未开始现金管理前，存款转账数字仅相当现金收付的四倍半，五月底转账数字已达现金收付的六倍，减少了现金的流通量，对金融物价的稳定和扶植生产更加有利。但由于该行对这一新的业务缺乏经验，工作中还存在不少缺点，对各机关是否都和银行建立了关系，是否都按规定留存现金，以及执行中有那些困难，如何解决，尚缺乏检查；此外，还有许多机关会计负责人对现金管理认识不够，从本位主义出发，有思想抵抗，怕麻烦，顾虑提取时受限制，或借口未接到上级指示，对银行采取敷衍态度，是须要切实纠正的。
