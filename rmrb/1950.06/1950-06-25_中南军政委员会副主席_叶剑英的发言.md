Xinhua News Agency, June 24th. Speech by Ye Jianying, Vice Chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 22nd. The full text is as follows: Chairman, Vice Chairmen, Members, Comrades:

    After listening to the seven reports by Vice Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Chen, Minister Bo, Deputy Chief of Staff Nie, Vice Premier Guo, and President Shen, I believe that our country, in the eight months since the establishment of the Central People's Government, has achieved great successes in all aspects of its work. Particularly significant is the military completion of a nationwide unification unprecedented in Chinese history, although Tibet, Taiwan, and a few other islands remain to be liberated. In finance, we have resolutely unified national financial management, stabilizing prices and consolidating currency value. In politics and diplomacy, we have signed the world-historically significant Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, which has consolidated the unity of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, and more powerfully guaranteed lasting world peace. This series of great achievements has politically united all classes, nationalities, parties, and groups in our country in a truly unprecedented way. This is the result of the consistent efforts of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government under his leadership, as well as the military and civilians across the country. I believe that based on all the work achievements already made, and continuing to implement Chairman Mao's policy of striving for a fundamental improvement in the nation's financial and economic situation, we will achieve even greater success.

    Chairman Mao's report on striving for a fundamental improvement in the nation's financial and economic situation has already been published. This report provides us with the following ideological armament: first, the imperialist war threat and danger still exist; second, as long as communists around the world can continue to unite all possible peace and democracy forces and enable them to achieve greater development, a new world war can be prevented; third, as long as we can strive for a situation of peaceful development, we will be able to achieve victory in the peaceful competition. This is completely correct. I think that what is most important for us today is that all our nationalities, democratic classes, and democratic parties should proactively (not passively) adopt a positive attitude and correct policies to unite and develop all possible domestic and international forces for peace and democracy. If we truly do this well, then we will be certain victors, whether in peace or even in war.

    However, we should point out that the people's enemies, the American imperialists and the remnant Kuomintang bandit gangs, are not only attempting to occupy Taiwan and put up a desperate resistance, but are also infiltrating the people's ranks from all sides to carry out conspiracies of sabotage. Therefore, we must strengthen unity and at the same time raise our vigilance.

    Today, the key question is: how can we unite and develop all possible forces for peace and democracy? This is not merely a matter of propaganda and education, although our cultural and educational work has also achieved significant successes during this period. We must grasp the principles of economic policy in the Common Program and Chairman Mao's policy in this report. In implementing policies, we must first be good at combining the common long-term economic interests of the people from all walks of life with their partial and temporary economic interests, and make the partial and temporary interests subordinate to the common and long-term interests. This is the material basis of unity.

    This is a very complex and difficult task. For example, in implementing land reform, how can we more smoothly and with less chaos eliminate the feudal land system, provide landless and land-poor peasants with means of production, rely on poor and farm laborers, unite with middle peasants, and at the same time preserve the rich peasant economy, in order to eliminate feudalism and benefit rural production!

    In adjusting the relations between various social economic components and various economic sectors, how should we adhere to division of labor and cooperation under the leadership of the state-owned economy, with each getting its due, and what adjustment methods should we adopt to rectify the abnormal relationships between them, so that the five economic components can jointly develop today and peacefully transition in the future!

    In implementing streamlining and demobilization, what kind of work should we do to achieve: on the one hand, streamlining institutions and strengthening national defense, and on the other hand, properly resettling people, reducing state expenditures, reducing the people's burden, and at the same time increasing social productive forces.

    Chairman Mao and the leaders of the Central Government have provided us with clear guidelines and implementation steps for these difficult tasks at this meeting. If we truly do them well, we will be able to unite the broadest domestic forces for peace and democracy to carry out the construction of the motherland and have the strength to defend world peace.

    I fully endorse the reports of the central leaders and firmly believe that the 140 million people in the Central South region will unite as one to fight for the thorough realization of the three conditions for striving for a fundamental improvement in the nation's financial and economic situation put forward by Chairman Mao.

    The vast majority of the Central South region is a new area. Here, the relationship of land ownership in rural areas is consistent with Vice Chairman Liu's analysis. That is to say, landlords and rich peasants, who account for less than 10 percent of the rural population, own about 70 to 80 percent of the land, while poor peasants, farm laborers, middle peasants, and other people, who account for about 90 percent of the rural population, own only about 20 to 30 percent of the land. Therefore, rural productivity cannot develop. Rural life is mired in extreme poverty and suffering. Especially in Guangdong, on the one hand, the area of cultivated land is narrow and grain production is insufficient for self-sufficiency; on the other hand, because of the landlords' cruel exploitation, the peasants' enthusiasm for production is damaged, causing land yields to gradually decrease, and a considerable amount of land is even abandoned. Under these circumstances, if land reform is not implemented and the feudal exploitation system of the landlords is not abolished, the peasants' productivity cannot be liberated, purchasing power cannot be increased, and the industrialization of the entire country is impossible. Therefore, the Central South region will make proper preparations in accordance with Vice Chairman Liu's report and the Land Law approved by this meeting, and strive to implement land reform in a population of 47 million to 56 million after the autumn harvest this year.

    In terms of industry and commerce, the Central South region has also encountered the difficulties in the process of reorganizing the entire national economy. Therefore, problems exist in public-private relations, labor-capital relations, and urban-rural relations. There have also been excessively tense phenomena in public-private relations in some economic sectors due to shortcomings in our work and errors of commandism and bureaucracy. We will earnestly follow Chairman Mao's instructions on striving for a fundamental improvement in the nation's financial and economic situation and Vice Premier Chen Yun's report to adjust these relationships, reduce blindness in production, and enable industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood to get their due under the leadership of the state-owned economy and coexist and prosper with the national economy.

    After listening to Deputy Chief of Staff Nie's military report, I believe that the People's Liberation Army, founded by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, has defeated and will thoroughly defeat all domestic and foreign enemies who dare to oppose the Chinese people's cause of liberation in the 23-year people's revolutionary war, and firmly defend the people's democratic dictatorship. Now, the lives of the vast majority of people across the country have entered a new period of peaceful construction. In order to increase construction forces and reduce the people's burden, Chairman Mao calls on us to demobilize a part of the People's Liberation Army, provided that there is sufficient strength to liberate Taiwan, Tibet, consolidate national defense, and suppress counter-revolutionaries. This means that a powerful armed force will be transferred to the production front, which will greatly help develop production, reduce the people's burden, and strengthen local work. The government and people of our Central South region express our heartfelt welcome to them and have an unshirkable responsibility to properly resettle this group of people's heroes and demobilized soldiers, so that they can return home to produce, return to their hometowns to work, or help them change careers. In short, we must enable them to live and work in peace and contentment, and unite with the people of the whole country to build our great motherland.

    The development of the Chinese revolution has gone through nearly thirty years of long-term armed struggle and base area construction, from nothing to something, from small to large, from weak to strong, from partial victory to nationwide victory. Therefore, the people and armed forces in many old base areas and old liberated areas have been under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party for a long time, fighting to the death with the enemy. They share weal and woe and are connected by flesh and blood with the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. The people in the old areas have tempered and raised their political consciousness in the struggle, and have created and accumulated various construction experiences. This kind of awareness and experience is a great force, which can help and support the construction work in various new areas. Our Central South region is relatively young in the country, and the vast majority is a new area, so it is very necessary for us to learn from the old areas. Only by learning from the old areas can we better complete our work tasks. Here, I would like to express my gratitude to the people in the old liberated areas for their past help to the Central South region in terms of manpower and materials. And I express my eager desire to learn from the old areas. Finally, let me represent the people of the entire Central South region to pay tribute to the great people's leader Chairman Mao, and wish Chairman Mao good health! Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!

    中南军政委员会副主席
    叶剑英的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】中南军政委员会副主席叶剑英廿二日在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上的发言。全文如下：主席、副主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    听了刘副主席、周总理、陈副总理、薄部长、聂副总参谋长、郭副总理、沈院长等七个报告以后，认为我们的国家，自从中央人民政府成立以来的八个月中，在各方面的工作上，已经获得了伟大的成绩，特别显著的是在军事上已完成中国历史上空前的全国大统一，虽然西藏、台湾及其他少数岛屿尚待解放。在财政上坚决的统一全国财政管理，使全国物价趋于平稳和币值趋于巩固。在政治上和外交上，签订了具有世界历史性的中苏友好条约，它巩固了中苏两大民族的团结，更加有力的保证了世界的持久和平。这一系列的伟大的成就，使我们国家各阶级间，各民族间，各党派间，各团体间，在政治上真正的空前的团结起来了。这是毛主席和在毛主席领导之下的中央人民政府与全国军民一致努力的结果。我相信在已经获得的这一切工作成绩的基础上，继续执行毛主席的争取国家财政经济基本好转的方针，我们将获得更伟大的成就。
    毛主席的争取国家财政经济基本好转的报告，已经发表了，这个报告，给我们以这样的思想上的武装，就是说：第一，帝国主义的战争威胁和危险依然存在；第二，只要全世界共产党能够继续团结一切可能的和平民主力量，并使之获得更大的发展，新的世界战争是能够制止的；第三，只要我们能够争得和平发展的局面，我们就能够在和平竞赛中获得胜利。这是完全正确的。我想，在我们今天最重要的是我们各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派均要主动的（不是被动的）采取积极的态度，和正确的政策，来团结并发展国内的国际的一切可能的和平民主力量，如果我们真正的这样做好了，那么我们无论在和平甚至在战争中，都是确定的胜利者。
    但是，我们应该指出，人民的敌人美国帝国主义者及国民党残余匪帮，不仅企图盘踞台湾，作绝望的反抗，而且正从各方面打进人民队伍中，进行阴谋破坏，因此，我们必须加强团结，同时要提高警惕。
    今天，问题的关键是：如何才能够团结和发展一切可能的和平民主的力量呢？这不仅仅是宣传教育问题，虽然我们在这一个时期的文教工作也获得了显著的成绩，我们必须把握共同纲领上经济政策的原则和毛主席这次报告的方针，在执行政策中，首先要善于把各界人民的共同的长远的经济利益和局部的暂时的经济利益结合起来，并使局部的暂时的利益，服从于共同的长远的利益，这是团结的物质基础。
    这是一种很复杂、很困难的工作，例如：在实行土地改革问题上，我们要如何才能更加顺利的，更少混乱的，消灭封建的土地制度，给无地少地农民以生产资料，要如何才能依靠贫农雇农、团结中农，同时又保存富农经济，以便消灭封建，以利农村生产！
    在调整各种社会经济成份与各个经济部门的关系问题上，我们要如何坚持在国营经济领导之下分工合作，各得其所，要采用怎样的调整的办法，以端正其相互间不正常的关系，使五种经济成份今天能够共同发展，将来可以和平转变！
    在实行整编复员的问题上，我们要怎样的工作，来达到：一方面要精简机构，强化国防，另一方面又要妥为安置，减少国家支出，减轻人民负担，同时增加社会生产力量。
    这些困难的工作，毛主席和中央政府各位首长，在此次会议上都给我们以明确的方针和实施步骤，如果我们真正的把它做好了，我们就能够最广泛的团结国内的和平民主力量，来进行祖国的建设，才能有力量保卫世界的和平。
    我完全拥护中央各首长的报告，并坚决相信中南区的一万万四千万人民，将团结一致的为彻底实现毛主席的争取国家财政经济状况基本好转的三条件而斗争。
    中南地区绝大部分是新区，在这里农村土地的占有关系，是和刘副主席的分析相符合的。就是说，占农村人口不到百分之十的地主和富农，占有约百分之七十至八十的土地，而占有农村人口约百分之九十的贫农、雇农、中农及其它人民，只占有约百分之二十至三十的土地。因此，农村生产力，不能发展。农村生活，陷于极端贫困与痛苦之中。特别在广东，一方面耕地面积狭窄，产粮不足自给，另一方面因为地主残酷的剥削，损害了农民的生产积极性，使得土地产量逐渐减少，并有不少土地，竟被荒废。在这种情形之下，如不实行土地改革，废除地主的封建剥削制度，则农民生产力，不能解放，购买力不能提高，整个国家工业化是不可能实现的。因此，中南区将根据刘副主席报告及这次会议所审定的土地法，妥为准备，在今年秋后，争取在四千七百万到五千六百万的人口中，实行土地改革。
    工商业方面，在中南区也同样遭遇到整个国民经济改组过程中的困难，因此，在公私关系上，劳资关系上，城乡关系上，都存在着一些问题，也曾因为我们工作中的缺点和有命令主义官僚主义的错误，使某些经济部门的公私关系有了过分紧张现象，我们将认真遵照毛主席的争取国家财政经济状况基本好转的指示及陈云副总理的报告调整这些关系，减少生产中的盲目性，使有利于国计民生的工商业，都能在国营经济的领导之下各得其所，与国家经济共存共荣。
    我听了聂副总参谋长的军事报告，认为毛主席朱总司令所手创的人民解放军，在二十三年人民革命战争中，已经打倒，并且还要彻底打倒一切敢于反对中国人民解放事业的国内国外的敌人，巩固的保卫人民民主专政。现在，全国绝大多数人民的生活，已转入和平建设的新时期，为了增加建设力量，减轻人民负担，毛主席号召我们，在保障有足够力量用于解放台湾、西藏巩固国防和镇压反革命条件下，将有一部分解放军复员。这就是说，将有一支强大的武装力量，转移到生产战线上去，这对发展生产，减轻人民负担与加强地方工作都有极大帮助，我们中南区的政府和人民，对他们表示衷心的欢迎并责无旁贷的，妥当的，安置这一批人民功臣，复员战士，使之能够回家生产，或还乡工作，或帮助转业。总而言之，要使之安居乐业，与全国人民一致，建设我们伟大的祖国。
    中国革命的发展，是经过长期武装斗争与根据地建设的将近三十年来，从无到有，从小到大，从弱到强，从局部胜利到全国胜利。因此，许多老根据地、老解放区的人民，和人民武装，长期在中国共产党领导之下，与敌人作殊死战，他们与共产党和解放军休戚与共血肉相连的。老区人民，在斗争中锻炼了和提高了政治觉悟，并创造了和积累了各种建设经验，这种觉悟和经验，是一种伟大的力量，它能够帮助和支持了各个新区的建设工作，我们中南区，在全国来说，是比较年青的一个，绝大部分是新区，因此我们向老区学习，是很必要的。也只有向老区学习，才能更好的完成工作任务。我在此，对于老解放区人民，过去对于中南区人力物力的帮助，表示感谢。并表示向老区学习的热望。最后让我代表全中南区人民，向伟大的人民领袖毛主席致敬，并祝毛主席健康！伟大的中国人民大团结万岁！
