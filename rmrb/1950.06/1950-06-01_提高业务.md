　　Improve Professional Skills
    Shang Heyu

　　Comrades in the theatrical world, many people are now paying attention to learning, which is very good. The purpose of learning is, first, to transform our thinking, and second, to improve our professional skills.

　　The scope of improving professional skills is very broad, and the most important thing is to practice skills and learn abilities well. Take me as an example. I am already over seventy years old, and although I am old, if you ask me to sing "Tie Long Shan", I can still do it without any problem. Why am I able to do this? Because I have never stopped practicing since I was a child. As the saying goes, "Practice until you're old, learn until you're old," that's exactly my situation. Another saying is, "Spirit doesn't forgive anyone," as long as you are willing to practice, you will surely succeed.

　　Why am I saying this? Because I see some young colleagues in the industry who become arrogant as soon as they achieve a little success in their technique. They forget the profound saying, "If you don't advance, you retreat." As a result, a very talented person ends up achieving nothing.

　　To learn abilities and practice techniques, first, you must have perseverance, and second, you must be humble. With perseverance, you can practice continuously and learn more intensively. With humility, you can accept criticism from others and absorb skills from various sources. If we practice our skills well, and have good kung fu in singing, acting, recitation, and acrobatics, and then stage some new plays with new content, how can we not be popular?

　　If we want to serve the people, we should perform for a long time; to perform for a long time, we should improve our professional skills and practice our kung fu well. This is a very simple principle, but we often overlook it. Therefore, I am raising this issue today, hoping that my colleagues, especially the young ones, will pay attention to it at all times in the future.

　　提高业务
    尚和玉
    戏剧界的同仁们，现在许多人都已经注意学习，这是很好的。学习的目的，第一是改造思想，第二是提高业务。
    提高业务的范围很广，其中最要紧的是应当好好地练功夫，学能耐。就拿我来说吧，今年已经七十多了，虽然年纪老，可是要叫我唱出铁龙山，照旧不含糊。为什么能这样呢？因为我从小到现在，一直没有搁下功夫。俗语说的好，“练到老，学到老”，我正是这种情形。又道是“精神不饶人”，只要你肯练，一定能成功。
    我为什么要说这话呢？因为看到有些年青的同业们，在技术上刚刚有点成就，立刻就骄傲起来。他忘了“不进则退”这句至理名言。结果呢，一个很有天才的人，只落得一无所成。
    学能耐，练技术，第一要有恒心，第二要肯虚心。有恒心才能不断的练，加紧的学。能虚心才能接受别人的批评，吸收多方面的技艺。如果我们把技艺练成，唱、做、念、打都有功夫，再排些新内容的剧本，还能不叫座吗？
    我们要想为人民服务，就该长远演唱下去；要长远演唱就该提高业务，就该好好地练功夫。这本是一个很浅近的道理，可是却时常被我们马虎过去。因此我今天提出了这个问题，希望同仁们尤其是年青的同仁们在今后能时刻注意。
