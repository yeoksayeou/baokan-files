　　The Way Out for Engineers
　　Zhang Hongkui

The author of this article, Zhang Hongkui, was formerly the captain of the Engineering Corps of the Shenyang Railway Administration. On May 2nd of this year, he was transferred to the Northeast Special Envoy Office of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, where he serves as the Deputy Minister of the Electrical and Engineering Department. This article is Zhang Hongkui's experience in participating in the People's Railway engineering work.

　　I. Establish a Revolutionary Outlook on Life

Engineers are intellectuals. In the past semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, the ideological consciousness of the old intellectuals was "personal interests first." They consciously or unconsciously served the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie to oppress and exploit the people. Sometimes, for the sake of profit, they became compradors of imperialism and did not hesitate to sell out the motherland.

With the victory of the People's Liberation War, the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie have been overthrown, and the aggressive forces of imperialism have been driven away. Chairman Mao said: "Our Chinese people have stood up from now on." Are engineers, as members of the people, still thinking of serving the landlord class, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and imperialism in pursuit of personal interests? If not, they must resolutely and quickly transform their outlook on life, establish a revolutionary outlook on life, and serve the people wholeheartedly, serve the working people, peasants, and soldiers, build a backward China into an independent and prosperous China, and transform an agricultural China into an industrialized China.

　　II. Strive to Learn from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union

The engineering science we engineers have learned in the past comes from capitalist society and has capitalist characteristics. Some people say: There is no distinction between capitalism and socialism in engineering science. This view is partly correct, but partly very wrong. Look at the typical capitalist country, the United States. During the economic panic from 1929 to 1932, they dumped large quantities of wheat into the sea. Railway steel beams were replaced due to insufficient load-bearing capacity. Intact old beams were burned and sunk into the water. Several railway companies' passenger trains departed from the same terminal to the same destination at the same time, but each train had an average of less than seven passengers. The above phenomena were generated after analysis by the big bosses, which was beneficial to the big bosses. From the perspective of the overall interests of the people, such destruction of labor achievements is such a great waste! Furthermore, their factory management methods were created by engineers using scientific minds, and their function is to enable capitalists to exploit more surplus value from workers. From the above situations, engineering science has class characteristics, that is to say, the set of engineering theories we engineers learned in the past is partly useful and partly violates the interests of the people. Today, we must sincerely serve the people, then we must transform our technical knowledge. The Soviet Union has more than 30 years of rich experience in building a socialist society, and their science serves the interests of the people 100%. We must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, so that our work can be guaranteed not to violate the interests of the people, and can be guaranteed not to make mistakes in principle.

　　III. Rely on the Worker Masses

When we engineers build a building, we always hope that it will be strong, durable, suitable, and beautiful. In short, we want to ensure quality. We engineers can draw design drawings, write construction specifications, and formulate construction plans. This is our ability. But can an engineer complete a building by himself? The buildings he designs must be completed by the labor and wisdom of the majority of workers. If we really want to guarantee the quality of the project, then we must rely on the experience, wisdom, and skills of the worker masses. That is to say, the design drawings and specifications must be explained in detail to the worker masses during construction, and studied and discussed. Otherwise, the design drawings we make are just beautiful pictures, and the specifications we set are just beautiful articles, which are just castles in the air.

Another requirement for the projects done by engineers is to reduce costs. Obviously, there was a railway before there was railway engineering, and there was a bridge before there was bridge engineering. The so-called "studies" are all organized and systematized from the experience gained in labor. How can the cost of the project be reduced? We say that we must first oppose corruption and waste. This cannot be done by the power of a few people. We must mobilize the worker masses to eradicate corruption and waste, and achieve the goal of reducing project costs.

Engineers have a theoretical foundation, but we must never be arrogant and complacent, we must learn from the workers. Chairman Mao said: "Only by being students of the masses can we be teachers of the masses." Look at the steel wire rope knots tied by the scaffolders, which become tighter and tighter when working, and loosen with a shake after work. How many of our engineers can tie them? The blacksmith tempers the steel needles for the stone chisel workers, making them hard and not brittle. How many of our engineers can do such work? I am just giving a few examples casually. If you pay attention to the construction site, there are countless such examples. In short, we can never finish learning the skills of the workers. The question is whether we want to learn humbly.

Therefore, we must help the workers improve their theoretical level. The workers must help us improve our technical level. In a word, technicians and workers must be closely integrated to do a good job.

　　IV. Strive Forward

Engineers! We must establish a revolutionary outlook on life, we must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we must rely on the worker masses, and on our theoretical foundation, strive to invent and create. This year's Second Northeast Railway May Day Labor Model Conference produced more labor heroes and model workers than last year's First Conference. We must learn from the workers, strive forward, and strive to produce more advanced workers at next year's Labor Model Conference! Strive! Forward!

　　工程师们的出路
    张鸿逵
    本文作者张鸿逵原任沈阳铁路管理局工程总队队长，今年五月二日，调至中央人民政府铁道部驻东北特派员办事处，任工电部副部长。本文是张鸿逵在参加人民铁道工程工作中的体验。
          ——编者
    一、树立革命的人生观
    工程师们都是知识分子，在过去半封建半殖民地的社会里，旧知识分子的思想意识是“个人利益第一”。他们自觉地或不自觉地给地主阶级、官僚资产阶级服务，来压迫人民，剥削人民，甚至有时因为图利而做了帝国主义的买办，不惜出卖祖国。
    随着人民解放战争的胜利，地主阶级和官僚资产阶级已经被打倒了，帝国主义的侵略势力已经被赶跑了。毛主席说：“我们中国人民从此站起来了。”工程师是人民的一分子，难道还想为地主阶级、官僚资产阶级及帝国主义服务以追求个人利益吗？不然的话，就必须坚决地赶快地转变人生观，树立革命的人生观，诚心诚意地为人民服务，为劳苦工农大众服务，把落后的中国建设为独立富强的中国，把农业的中国转变为工业化的中国。
    二、努力学习苏联的先进经验
    我们工程师过去所学的工程科学是由资本主义社会里学来的，是带有资本主义性质的。有人说：工程科学没有资本主义与社会主义之分。这种看法一部分是对的，而一部分则大谬不然。请看资本主义典型的美国吧。在一九二九年至一九三二年的经济恐慌中，他们曾把大量的麦子投入海中，铁路上因荷重不够而更换钢梁，曾把完整的旧梁烧断，沉入水中，几个铁路公司的旅客列车同时由一个总站开往同一目的地，但每辆车里的旅客平均不足七个人。以上种种现象是经过大老板的分析而产生的，这对大老板说，是有利的，若就人民的整体利益来讲，像这样毁灭劳动成果，是多么大的浪费啊！再者，他们的工厂管理方法是工程师们用科学头脑创造出来的，其作用在于使资本家在工人身上剥削更多的剩余价值。由上面这些情况来看，工程科学是有阶级性的，也就是说，过去我们工程师所学的一套工程理论，一部分是有用的，而一部分则是违反人民利益的。我们今天必须诚心诚意为人民服务，那么我们就必须把我们的技术知识加以改造。苏联建设社会主义社会已有三十多年的丰富经验，他们的科学是百分之百为人民利益服务的，我们必须学习苏联的先进经验，然后我们的工作，才能保证不致违反人民利益，才能保证不犯原则上的错误。
    三、依靠工人群众
    我们工程师做一个建筑物，总希望它能坚固、耐久、合用、美观，简言之，就是保证质量。我们工程师能画设计图，能写施工规范书，能制定施工计划，这是我们的本领。但一个工程师试问他能完成一个建筑物吗？他所设计的建筑物必需用大多数工人的劳动和智慧来完成。假使我们真的愿意保证工程质量，那么我们必须依靠工人群众的经验、智慧、技术。这就是说，在施工中必须把设计图，规范书向工人群众详细地说明，并研究讨论。不然的话，我们所制的设计图只是一张美丽的图画，我们所订的规范书只是一篇美丽的文章，说来说去还只是空中楼阁。
    工程师所做工程的另一要求是减低成本。很明显地，先有铁路而后有铁路工程学，先有桥梁而后有桥梁工程学。所谓什么什么“学”，全是由劳动中所得到的经验加以整理，使其系统化而已。怎样能使工程成本减低呢？我们说要首先反贪污、反浪费。这不是少数人的力量所能办到的，必须发动工人群众，才能根绝贪污浪费现象，才能达到减低工程成本的目的。
    工程师们是有理论基础的，但我们决不应骄傲自满，必须向工人学习。毛主席说：“只有做群众的学生，才能做群众的先生。”试看架子工绑的钢丝绳结，工作时越拉越紧，工作完了一抖就松，试问我们工程师能有几个会绑吗？铁匠给凿石工人的钢针子沾火，既坚硬而又不脆，我们工程师能有几个会搞这样的工作呢？我仅随便举几个例子，你若用心到工地一看，这样的例子可就不胜枚举了。总而言之，工人的技术我们是学不完的，问题在于我们要虚心学习。
    因此，我们要帮助工人，提高他们的理论水平。工人要帮助我们，提高我们的技术水平。一句话，技术人员与工人必须密切结合起来，才能把工作搞好。
    四、努力前进
    工程师们！我们必须树立革命的人生观，必须学习苏联的先进经验，必须依靠工人群众，在我们的理论基础上，努力发明创造。今年东北铁路第二届五一劳模大会，较去年第一届涌现了更多的劳动英雄和模范工作者，我们要向工人看齐，努力前进，争取在明年的劳模大会上，涌现更多的先进工作者吧！努力！前进！
