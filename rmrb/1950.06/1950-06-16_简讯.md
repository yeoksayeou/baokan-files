    Streetlights Repaired Promptly Upon Report
    Because the city area is vast and a large number of streetlights are installed, the Beijing Electricity Bureau believes it would be difficult for its limited number of streetlight inspectors to conduct thorough investigations. Therefore, it has sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to inform district and street governments to convey to all sectors of society that if anyone discovers that a streetlight is damaged or not lit, please call the Beijing Electricity Bureau's Engineering Section (telephone 3-5732), which will immediately dispatch workers for repairs.
