　　Zhangjiakou Telecommunications Bureau Accepts Suggestions
　　Plans to Rebuild Datong-Zhangjiakou Section of Telephone Poles
Editor Comrade:
　　We read the suggestion published in the May 28th "People's Garden" regarding the repair of the leaning telephone poles on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. The telephone poles on the Datong-Zhangjiakou section of the Beijing-Suiyuan main line were completely damaged during the war. After the liberation of Datong last May, this bureau was ordered to urgently repair the telephone poles in that section to facilitate communication. However, due to the lack of materials at the time and insufficient planning, the newly installed lines in that section frequently experienced problems last winter. This year, again limited by the difficulty in obtaining materials, the telephone poles in that section were not included in the reconstruction plan, only strengthened maintenance measures were taken (adding guy wires, straightening, deepening burial, etc.). However, on May 4th, a strong wind caused more than 300 telephone poles along the route to tilt and fall, causing communication between Zhangjiakou and Datong to be interrupted. After workers braved the wind to repair them, communication was temporarily restored after eighteen hours. In order to thoroughly rectify this line, this bureau has submitted a request to the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications for approval to include the telephone poles in that section as one of the reconstruction projects in the 1951 construction plan.

### 张市电信局接受建议  计划重建同张段电杆

　　张市电信局接受建议
    计划重建同张段电杆编辑同志：
    我们读到了五月二十八日《人民园地》上刊载的重修京绥铁路上歪倒电杆的建议。京绥干线同张段电杆在战争中已全部破损。去年五月大同解放后，本局奉命抢修该段电杆，以利通信。但因当时器材缺乏，加以计划不周，去冬该段新设线路，时常发生障碍。今年又限于器材困难，该段电杆未列入重建计划之内，仅作加强维护措施（添拉线，扶正，埋深等）。但五月四日起了大风，沿途电杆歪倒三百余根，以致张、同间通信中断。经工人同志冒风抢修，十八小时后才临时恢复通信。为了彻底整理该线，本局已提请邮电部电信总局核准，在一九五一年建设计划中把该段电杆列为重建工程之一。
