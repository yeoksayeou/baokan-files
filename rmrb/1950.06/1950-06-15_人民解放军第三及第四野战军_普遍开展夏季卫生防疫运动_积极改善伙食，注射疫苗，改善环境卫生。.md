Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 11th. The People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army's summer health and epidemic prevention campaign has been fully launched.

　　During the campaign, the first thing that all units are paying attention to is further improving the nutritional status of the troops on the basis of the spring health campaign. In the past, some units suffered from diseases such as night blindness, scrotal dermatitis, stomatitis, and anemia due to the lack of certain vitamins and nutrients in their food. These diseases have been significantly reduced after the spring health campaign. The main reason for the current lack of nutrition is that some units do not know how to adjust food according to its nutritional value, and the cooks also lack cooking knowledge, which causes the loss of nutrients in the food. Therefore, since the beginning of summer, various units have systematically conducted education and training on nutrition knowledge for medical personnel; rotated training for cooks to improve cooking methods; and increased foods such as lean meat, beans, and fresh vegetables in the daily meals. Nutritional deficiencies have now been mostly cured, and the physical strength of commanders and fighters has been significantly enhanced. According to the inspection results of a certain regiment, the average weight of each person increased by one pound in half a month.

　　In order to prevent various summer epidemics, by the end of May, more than 98% of the entire army had been vaccinated with typhoid and cholera mixed vaccines. Among the front-line troops, tetanus vaccine was partially injected. Troops stationed in Fujian and other places were vaccinated against plague, and a universal rat-catching campaign was launched. According to statistics from a certain division, the unit caught more than 18,000 rats in two weeks, and all indoor areas were disinfected. The entire army's anti-malaria preparations are also actively underway. The military region and the Third Field Army's Logistics Department distributed all mosquito nets at the beginning of summer, one for each person. A large number of anti-malaria drugs are continuing to be raised, purchased, and distributed. Soldiers have also created tools such as mosquito-catching lamps, mosquito nets, mosquito-proof socks, and mosquito-proof gloves. In addition, various units are continuing to vigorously improve environmental hygiene. The military region and the Third Field Army's Health Department have also purchased a large number of lime and DDT to distribute to the troops. Many kitchens have been equipped with screens and gauze covers; each company has dug an average of more than two wells, strictly ensuring that river water is not used and raw and cold food is not consumed.

　　At the same time, the health departments of the army and navy units stationed in large cities such as Shanghai and Nanjing are actively cooperating with local health authorities to carry out social health work, organizing vaccination teams to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of citizens and conducting summer health propaganda. Troops stationed in rural areas are also mobilizing and assisting residents in improving environmental hygiene through various forms of propaganda.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 12th. The Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army have decided to launch an army-wide health and epidemic prevention campaign from June to August.

　　The Logistics and Health Department of the Field Army began preparing for the launch of this campaign in March. First, a military-wide health work conference was held, which uniformly stipulated the policy of "prevention first, treatment second"; then, health cadres from various armies and divisions were trained, and epidemic prevention teams were sent to Guangxi, where there were the most diseases, for key treatment to gain experience. After a certain unit stationed in Guangxi launched epidemic prevention work with the assistance of the epidemic prevention team, the number of patients in the unit was greatly reduced. According to statistics, in addition to a few patients with dysentery and athlete's foot, only twelve smallpox patients were found in the unit, all of whom were cured after treatment. Other diseases such as typhoid, cholera, and plague did not occur.

　　In terms of material preparation, a large number of DDT, disinfectants, laboratory supplies and other materials were purchased and distributed to various units. In addition, vaccination was vigorously promoted, and by the end of May, 91% of the entire army had completed preventive injections.

　　According to the planned schedule, the epidemic prevention campaign starting in June will first spend half a month completing in-depth mobilization and specific preparation work. Extensive publicity and education will be carried out in the troops, and epidemic prevention committees will be established at all levels of the troops. Joint epidemic prevention committees will be established in conjunction with the medical personnel of local party and government organs and mass organizations to investigate and study the local health and disease conditions and formulate unified health and epidemic prevention measures.

　　Starting from the second half of June, epidemic prevention teams at all levels will go deep into the troops to initiate the formulation of health covenants and launch health competitions. Health departments above the division level will establish mobile laboratories to conduct mobile testing in order to detect sources of infection as early as possible and prevent them in advance.

　　When launching the health and epidemic prevention campaign, various units will distinguish different priorities according to different tasks and different regions. Anti-bandit troops should focus on preventing colds after being rained on, heatstroke during marches, and gastrointestinal diseases caused by carelessness in diet. Troops undertaking production tasks should prevent overexertion, promote frequent bathing and changing clothes, and prevent eczema. Troops stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi should abstain from eating raw fish, shrimp, and crabs, and eat more brown rice to prevent parasitic diseases and beriberi. Troops stationed on Hainan Island should vigorously prevent malaria. Troops stationed in Henan Province should pay attention to preventing sandflies from transmitting kala-azar. Troops along the Yangtze River and lakes should pay attention to investigating whether there are Schistosoma japonicum; in areas where this parasite has been found, troops are strictly prohibited from bathing in the water.

　　The Logistics and Health Department plans to establish inspection groups in August to conduct focused inspections and summaries.

　　人民解放军第三及第四野战军
    普遍开展夏季卫生防疫运动
    积极改善伙食，注射疫苗，改善环境卫生。
    【新华社南京十一日电】人民解放军第三野战军夏季卫生防疫运动已全面展开。
    各部在运动中首先注意的是在春季健康运动的基础上进一步改善部队营养状况。过去某些部队，由于在食物中缺乏某些维他命与营养成分，曾发生夜盲、阴囊皮炎、口腔炎与贫血等疾病。这些疾病经春季人马健康运动后，已显著减少。现在缺乏营养的主要原因是某些单位不懂得根据营养价值调剂伙食，炊事员也缺乏烹煮常识，致使食物中营养成分受到损失。为此，入夏以来，各部有计划地对医务人员进行有关营养知识的教育与训练；轮训炊事人员，改进烹煮方法；并在日常伙食中增加瘦肉类、豆类及新鲜蔬菜等食物。现缺乏营养病症已大部治愈，指战员体力显著增强。据某团检查结果，半月内平均每人体重增加一磅。
    为了防止夏季各种流行病症，至五月底止，全军百分之九十八以上已注射了伤寒霍乱混合菌苗。前线部队中，部分地注射了破伤风菌苗。驻在福建等地部队注射了鼠疫预防菌苗，并普遍开展捕鼠运动。据某师统计：该部在两周内即捕鼠一万八千余只，所有室内均进行了消毒。全军抗疟准备工作亦在积极进行中。军区和三野后勤部已于夏初将蚊帐全部发下，每人一顶。大批抗疟药品正在继续筹集、采购与分发中。战士并创制了捕蚊灯、捕蚊网、防蚊袜、防蚊手套等工具。此外，各部正继续大力改进环境卫生。军区、三野卫生部并购买大批石灰与ＤＤＴ发给部队，许多厨房已设置纱窗纱罩；每个连队平均已挖了两口以上的水井，严格做到禁用河水与禁饮生冷的食物。
    同时，驻上海、南京等大城市的陆海军部队的卫生工作部门并积极配合当地卫生机关，开展社会卫生工作，组织注射团，为数十万市民注射防疫针，进行夏令卫生宣传。驻乡村的部队，亦通过各种宣传方式，动员与协助居民改善环境卫生。
    【新华社汉口十二日电】人民解放军中南军区暨第四野战军决定自六月至八月展开全军卫生防疫运动。
    野战军后勤卫生部在三月间即进行展开这一运动的准备工作。首先召开了全军卫生工作会议，统一规定了“预防为主，治疗为辅”的方针；接着就调训各军、师卫生干部，并派出防疫队，前往疾病最多的广西进行重点治疗，取得经验。驻广西某部在防疫队协助展开防疫工作后，部队患病者大为减少。据统计，该部除发现少数痢疾、脚气病患者外，天花患者仅十二名，均经治疗痊愈。其他如伤寒、霍乱、鼠疫等病都没有发生。
    在物质准备方面，购置了大批ＤＤＴ、消毒药品、化验品等材料分发给各部。此外，又以大力推行疫苗接种，截至五月底止，全军完成防疫注射者已达百分之九十一。
    按预定计划，六月份开始的防疫运动，将首先以半个月时间完成深入动员和具体准备工作。在部队中进行广泛宣传教育，同时建立部队各级防疫委员会，并联合当地的党政机关和群众团体的医务人员成立联合的防疫委员会，调查研究当地卫生、疾病状况，制订统一的卫生防疫办法。
    自六月下半月起，各级防疫队即深入部队，发动订立卫生公约，展开卫生竞赛。师以上卫生部门建立巡回化验室，进行巡回化验，以便及早发现病源，事前预防。
    各部在展开卫生防疫运动时将根据不同任务、不同地区，区分不同的重点。剿匪部队以预防雨淋后患感冒、行军时中暑、饮食不注意害胃肠病为主。担负生产任务的部队防止超体力的劳动，提倡多洗澡、换衣、预防湿疹。驻广东、广西的部队，禁食生鱼、虾、蟹，多吃糙米，以防止寄生虫病和脚气病。驻海南岛部队要大力防止疟疾。驻河南部队应注意防止白蛉子传染黑热病。沿江及湖边部队应注意调查有无日本住血吸虫，凡已发现这种寄生虫的地区，严禁部队下水洗澡。
    后勤卫生部准备在八月成立巡视团进行有重点的检查、总结。
