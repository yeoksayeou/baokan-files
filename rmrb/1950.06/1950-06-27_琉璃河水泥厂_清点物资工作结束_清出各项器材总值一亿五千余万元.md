　　Liulihe Cement Plant
    Inventory Work Completed
    Clearing Out Equipment Valued at Over 150 Million Yuan
    [This newspaper reports] The Liulihe Cement Plant's inventory work, which began on March 20th, concluded on June 14th. Through this inventory work, over 23,000 types of warehouse materials were sorted, and over 520 tons of unrecorded materials, including drill bits, miscellaneous iron castings, and electrical materials, were cleared out, totaling 156,690,000 yuan, equivalent to 156,997 catties of millet.
    Before the inventory began, the plant studied relevant documents to enhance the staff's awareness of the importance of this work. A seven-member inventory committee was formed, led by the plant director and including the materials supervisor, engineers, material accountants, and experienced staff members. The committee was divided into six groups for collection, identification, and numbering. Thanks to the diligent work of the staff, many valuable finished equipment items were cleared out, such as support roller bearing seats, axle bushes, discharge ports, bearing support rollers, grinding mouths, and feeding augers. The power group cleared out three-section resistors, oil engine switches, current and voltage transformers, copper links, pawls, and line wheels, all of which are essential and difficult-to-purchase items for the factory. In addition, documents and files from the Japanese puppet period, including construction materials and blueprints of various kinds, were also inventoried.
    During the inventory work, staff members worked through lunch breaks, after work, and even on Sundays. To expedite the compilation of quotas, standards, and the uniform numbering of warehouses, they often worked late into the night. When collecting scattered materials, staff members contributed various equipment items. For example, Lü Peijun discovered over 40 kilograms of "steel balls" (which were in short supply in the factory) hidden in a cellar by the Japanese puppet era guard team and voluntarily dug them up and sent them to the factory. Zhao Qishun, a worker in the grinding workshop, contributed an old foreign drill bit that had been stored for many years, and worker Wang Yatian contributed a soldering needle (welding tool)... After this inventory, all the scattered screws and materials throughout the plant were accounted for. At the same time, the centralization of materials has greatly facilitated future allocation and utilization work.
    The plant is currently carrying out further verification work.

　　琉璃河水泥厂
    清点物资工作结束
    清出各项器材总值一亿五千余万元
    【本报讯】琉璃河水泥厂清点物资工作，于三月二十日开始，已于六月十四日结束。通过这次清点工作，整理了库房材料二万三千余种，清出全厂账外物资牙轮、杂项铁铸件、电气材料五百二十余吨，总值一亿五千六百九十余万元，合小米十五万六千九百九十七斤。
    该厂在未进行清点之前，曾学习了有关文件，提高了职工对此工作的重视。并组成了以厂长为领导的，包括材料主管、工程人员、材料会计及有识物经验的职工等七人的清点委员会，下设收集、识别、编号等六个小组。由于广大职工认真工作，清出了价格昂贵的成件器材多种，如托轮瓦座、轴瓦、下料口、轴承托轮、磨口、送料绞刀等。动力组清查出的三连抵抗器、油机开关、变流变压器、铜连环、塞轮、线轮等，都是工厂必需而又不易购买的贵重物品。此外，并清点出日伪时期的资料文件，包括建厂资料各色蓝图。
    清点工作中，职工在中午，下班后，甚至星期日也不休息。为了赶编定额、定量及统一库房的编号，常忙到深夜。在汇集分散物资时，职工们先后献纳器材多种。如吕培隽发现日伪时代警卫队隐匿在地窖的四十多公斤“钢球”（此物厂内很缺），自动挖起送厂。磨房工人赵起顺献出存放多年的洋钻头一个，工人王雅田献出了拐针子（焊接用具）……。全厂经过这次清点，已往零落各处的螺钉和材料都没有了，同时材料集中后，对今后的配用工作上，给了很大方便。
    该厂现正进一步进行复点工作。
