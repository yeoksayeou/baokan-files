The Study of Worker-Peasant Students at the Renmin University of China
By Our Correspondent Jin Feng

Sixty percent of the students at the Renmin University of China are worker-peasant cadres and industrial workers. In the two and a half months since the start of the semester, they have been studying tenaciously, overcoming numerous difficulties.

These new heroes and heroines who have fought on all fronts of the Chinese revolution—military and political, urban and rural—for eight, ten, or even fourteen years, who were not long ago sweating beside machines, guarding the national defense at the Wusongkou Fort, or leading the emancipated peasants in remote counties of the Northeast in large-scale production... now their hands that operated machines, held guns, and gripped hoe handles, are beginning to write clumsy but extremely earnest horizontal lines of foreign languages and solve complex math problems.

The difficulties are not small.

Over eighty percent of them have a cultural level equivalent to junior high school or even elementary school, and less than twenty percent have a level equivalent to high school or university. Yet they are required to study for two to four years to become specialized personnel capable of undertaking economic, political, and construction work.

The most concrete difficulties are in learning Russian and mathematics. The vast majority of them have no foreign language foundation, making it doubly difficult to understand Russian grammar; at the same time, they are generally over twenty years old, with poorer memory, while learning a foreign language requires a good memory; the same is true for mathematics. They generally only know how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, but now they have to learn algebra and calculus, and master them in the shortest possible time.

They faced these difficulties squarely and engaged in learning with fighting optimism, holding the sure-win confidence and determination to overcome them. Hu Hai, a student in the Department of Trade and a former truck driver, said frankly with the spirit of the working class: "We are from worker-peasant backgrounds and never learned foreign languages that go sideways or foreign weights and measures since we were young. It would be a miracle if we didn't have difficulties learning them now. The problem is that we will never be intimidated by these difficulties." Du Tingrui, also a student in the Department of Trade, who had participated in the people's revolutionary war since 1938, made this vow upon entering the school: "I was a shock worker in the war, and I must strive to be a shock worker in learning!"

But facing difficulties squarely is not the same as overcoming them, and having the confidence to win is not the same as winning; overcoming difficulties and winning are achieved through step-by-step struggle.

They studied diligently, forgetting to eat and sleep. Those students from intellectual backgrounds who had a foundation in foreign languages studied Russian for one hour, while they studied for two hours; those students from intellectual backgrounds who took notes once in class, they could only jot down the main points in class, and after class, they borrowed the notes of students with higher cultural levels to re-copy and clarify them. In this way, they got up earlier than others in the morning and went to bed later than others at night, squeezing out the prescribed nap time to read and write, sleeping only five or six hours a day.

Zhang Dangui, a student in the Department of Economics, worked on a math problem from breakfast to dinner one Sunday until he finally solved it. Hu Hai of the Department of Trade could not understand documents or take notes when he first arrived and had attended the cultural tutoring class set up by the school to take care of students with low cultural levels. In two months, he created amazing results for himself—he got full marks in Russian and math exams, and his answer to the political class's Chinese Revolutionary History was also the best in the class. He not only did not need to attend cultural tutoring classes but also rose from the lowest fourth class to the second class during class adjustments. His classmates were excited by his amazing progress and asked him what the secret was. Hu Hai replied, "I don't have any extraordinary methods. The main thing is that I am not afraid of labor, and I am willing to use my brain to delve into it. If I don't understand a problem, whether it's in politics or math, I won't stop. The more difficult it is, the less I will let go. I will delve into it. Either I finally figure it out myself—which is mostly the case—or if I can't figure it out at all, I will ask others for help."

They do not care about "face." When learning Russian, even though they speak haltingly, they all compete to ask and answer each other after class, and they compete to practice speaking in class, which makes their Russian progress quite fast. They are also good at connecting learning with practice, writing the new Russian vocabulary they learn every day on the tables, chairs, and daily utensils they use, so that they can see them and remember them at any time; they apply the math examples they have learned to solve some problems they encounter in real life.

The first exam was a test of their learning. Almost all the students in the Department of Diplomacy were from worker-peasant cadre backgrounds, and those who scored the highest and excellent grades in Russian accounted for more than 80% of the class. Eighty percent of the students in the Department of Trade were from worker-peasant cadre and worker backgrounds, and those who scored the highest and excellent grades in mathematics accounted for 90% of the class. They won the first round of victory!

　　中国人民大学工农学员的学习
    本报记者  金凤
    中国人民大学的学生，百分之六十是工农干部和产业工人。在开学以来的两个半月中，他们克服着重重困难，顽强地学习着。
    这些在中国革命的军事和政治、城市和乡村的各条战线上斗争了八年、十年以至十四年的新儿女英雄们，不久以前还站在机器旁边流着汗的，在吴淞口炮台要塞警卫着国防的，在东北边远的县份里领导着翻身农民搞大生产的……如今他们那些开动着机器的手、拿枪的手、捏着锄头柄的手，都开始笨拙地然而极为认真地写起横行的外国文，做起复杂的数学题来。
    困难是不小的。
    他们现有的文化水平，百分之八十以上都是相当于初中甚至高小的程度，只有不到百分之二十的人才有着相当于高中或大学的程度。而要求他们的是要在两年到四年内学习成为担负经济、政治、建设工作的专门人材。
    最具体的困难表现在学习俄文和数学方面。他们当中，极大多数没有外文基础，理解俄文的文法，就显得加倍困难；同时一般的年龄又都在二十岁以上，记忆力较差，而学外国文又恰恰很需要记性；数学方面也一样。他们一般只会算加减乘除，如今则不但要学代数，还要学微积分，还要在最短的时间内掌握它们。
    他们正视了这些困难，并以战斗的乐观主义，抱着克服困难的必胜的信心和决心来从事学习。贸易系学员——汽车司机出身的胡海以工人阶级的气魄爽朗地说：“咱们工农出身，从小没学过横起走的外国文和洋砝码，现在学起来，要说没有困难才活见鬼。问题是在咱们决不会被这些困难所唬倒。”也是贸易系学员——一九三八年起就参加人民革命战争的杜廷瑞在入学时就立下这样的誓言：“在战争中我是个突击手，在学习上我也一定要争取做突击手！”
    但正视困难并不等于克服了困难，有了胜利的信心也并不等于获得了胜利；克服困难和获得胜利，是经过步步的斗争的。
    他们刻苦地废寝忘食地学习着。那些有着外文基础的知识分子出身的同学念一小时俄文，他们就念两小时；那些知识分子出身的同学上课抄一遍笔记，他们在上课时只能记个大要，下课以后，再借文化程度高的同学的笔记来重新对照誊清。这样，他们清早比别人起得早，晚上比别人睡得迟，规定午睡的时间也挤出来读和写，一天只睡五六个钟头。
    经济系学员张丹桂为了解决一个算题，曾在一个星期日从早饭作到晚饭，直到最后解决。贸易系的胡海刚来时文件看不懂，笔记记不下，曾参加过学校为照顾文化程度低的学员而设置的文化补习班。两个月中，他为自己创造了惊人的成绩——俄文、数学的考试都得了满分，政治课中国革命史的答案也是全班最好的一份。他不但不在文化补习班补习，而且在调整编班时从最低的第四班升到了第二班。同学们为他这惊人的进步所激动，问他竟究有什么秘诀时，胡海回答道：“我并没有什么出奇的办法。主要的就是我不怕劳动，我肯用脑子钻进去。一个问题，不管是政治课的还是数学上的，我搞不清楚是不肯歇手的，越是困难的我越不肯放松，我越要钻进去。或者我自己终于想通了——大半的情形是这样；或者我始终想不出来，就去请教旁人帮助解决。”
    他们不爱“面子”，学俄文时尽管讲得结结巴巴，却都争着在课后互相问答，在上课时争着练习发言，这就使他们的俄文进步得相当快起来。他们又善于联系实际来学习，把每天新学的俄文生字写在应用的桌子、椅子和日常用具上，以便随时看到、随时记住；他们把学过的数学例题应用来解决实际生活中所遇到的一些问题。
    第一次考试是他们学习的考验。外交系学员几乎全部是工农干部出身的，俄文成绩最优的和优等的占全班人数百分之八十以上。贸易系学员百分之八十是工农干部和工人出身的，数学成绩最优的和优等的占全班人数百分之九十。他们赢得了第一回合的胜利！
