　　[Reported by this newspaper] News from the National Warehouse Material Inventory and Allocation Committee: Since the warehouse material inventory work was launched nationwide, it has progressed relatively smoothly and achieved considerable results. Some regions and departments, such as the Southwest and Chahar sub-committees, have conducted more in-depth ideological mobilization work, and the Ministry of Railways has even proposed a challenge competition with the Ministry of Heavy Industry, so the general work has progressed faster and better. Regarding reporting old and unused materials in their respective departments, Notice No. 1 of the National Warehouse Material Inventory and Allocation Committee stipulated that "If each sub-committee discovers that enterprises have large quantities of important equipment that are not needed by the enterprise, they should immediately report to the general committee for timely allocation." Currently, the General Logistics Department, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Railways, the People's Bank of China, and other units have conducted inspections in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's decision and have successively reported a portion. Specifically: The General Logistics Department discovered that it had 597,222 jin of salt from past acquisitions and took the initiative to hand it over to the Ministry of Finance. It has now been approved by the Central Finance and Economics Committee for the Ministry of Finance to allocate it to the trade sector for sale in installments, which is estimated to increase the national treasury revenue by approximately 800 million yuan (this is the estimate before the salt tax reduction). The Ministry of Fuel Industry reported that the North China Electric Power and Coal Industry Administration had unused machines (including winches, small motors, etc.), 60-type mortars, 75KW cylinder generators, one 80-ton locomotive (stored in Jingxing), and 15,000 railroad screws (stored in Zhangjiakou). The first two items have been approved by the Central Finance and Economics Committee for use by various coal mines and the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission, respectively; the latter three items are being negotiated with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Railways on how to utilize them. The Jiangxi Telecommunications Bureau, under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, found more than 11,000 barrels of tung oil that had been acquired. After consideration by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, in addition to the 2,000 barrels needed by the bureau itself this year, the remaining more than 9,000 barrels were reported for allocation. The Central Finance and Economics Committee has ordered the Ministry of Trade to receive and sell this tung oil to increase the national treasury revenue. The People's Bank of China has closed down printing plants and small paper mills in Shexian and other places. The bank has requested allocation, which is currently being studied by the National Warehouse Material Inventory Committee on how to utilize it. The Jinan Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Railways reported a batch of aviation equipment, which has been allocated by the Central Finance and Economics Committee to the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission. In addition, the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Health have also reported a small amount of materials.

　　In addition to these good examples, there are still some shortcomings in the process of inventorying warehouses. For example, some regions or departments do not have sufficient understanding of this work and have generated ideas such as "there is nothing to clear" or "it has already been cleared," which leads to a lack of attention. For example, Guangzhou initially estimated that there were not many materials in the city, but after inspection, it was roughly estimated that there were materials worth about 1 billion jin of rice. Some departments emphasize that there are few things before in-depth inventory, and say: "The things in our warehouse are all for our own department's use and cannot be transferred out." In fact, it is the departmentalism of not wanting to hand over, and they plan to keep it for their own sale or mutual exchange. These incorrect ideas have caused some resistance in the progress of the work. Therefore, the National Warehouse Material Allocation Committee hopes that each sub-committee will strengthen the overall thinking of unified financial and economic work in leading the warehouse inventory work, actively investigate national assets and hand them over in a timely manner to increase national treasury revenue and utilize stockpiled materials.

### 全国普遍进行清理仓库工作  不少部门已上报清出物资请求调配  某些轻视清理工作的思想必须克服

　　全国普遍进行清理仓库工作
    不少部门已上报清出物资请求调配
    某些轻视清理工作的思想必须克服
    【本报讯】全国仓库物资清理调配委员会消息：仓库物资清理工作在全国展开以后，进行比较顺利，且有了相当成绩。有些地区和部门，如西南、察哈尔分会进行了比较深入的思想动员工作，铁道部并提出要与重工业部挑战竞赛，一般工作即进行得较快、较好。在上报本部门旧存不用物资方面，全国仓库物资清理调配委员会第一号通知曾规定“各部分会发现各企业中存有大宗重要的器材而为该企业不需用者，应立即报告总会以便及时调配。”现已有后勤部、燃料工业部、邮电部、铁道部、人民银行等单位根据政务院决定的精神进行了检查，并已先后上报了一部分。计：后勤部发现过去接收有食盐五十九万七千二百二十二斤，即主动交给财政部。现已经中央财经委员会核准由财政部拨交贸易部分期出售，估计可增加国库收入约八亿余元（此系盐税未减以前的估计）。燃料工业部上报华北电业及煤业两管理局存有不用的机器（包括卷扬机、小型电机等）、六○式迫击炮、七五ＫＷ汽缸式发电机、八○吨机车一辆（井陉存）及道罗丝一万五千条（张家口存）。前两项已经中央财经委员会批准分别交各煤矿及军委后勤部使用；后三项正与教育部及铁道部接洽如何利用中。邮电部所属江西电信局查出接收的桐油一万一千多桶，经邮电部考虑，除该局本身今年需用二千桶外，其余九千余桶均上报请求调配，现已由中央财经委员会饬令贸易部将此项桐油接收出售，增加国库收入。人民银行在涉县等地的印刷厂及小型造纸厂现已停工，该行报请调配，现正由全国仓库物资清理委员会研究如何利用中。铁道部济南局上报航空器材一批，已经中央财经委员会调给军委后勤部使用。此外交通部、卫生部亦有少量物资上报。
    除以上这些好的例子外，在清理仓库过程中，仍有若干缺点。如有的地区或部门对此工作认识不足，产生“没有什么可清”或“已经清理过了”等不重视的思想。如广州方面对该市物资开始估计不多，一经检查，据粗略估计即有约值十亿斤大米的物资。有的部门在未深入清理时便强调东西少，并说：“我们库里的东西都是本部门自己用的，调不出去。”实际上就是不愿上交的本位主义思想在作祟，并打算留下自行出售或互相交换。这些不正确的思想均曾在工作进行中发生一些阻力。因此，全国仓库物资调配委员会希望各分会在领导清理仓库工作中，应更加强统一财经工作的整体思想，积极清查国家资财及时上交，以增加国库收入和运用积压的物资。
