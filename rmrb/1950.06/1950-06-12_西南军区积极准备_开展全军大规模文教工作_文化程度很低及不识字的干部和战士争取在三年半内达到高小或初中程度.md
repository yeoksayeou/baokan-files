Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th: The Southwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army will launch large-scale cultural and educational work throughout the army starting next year and is now actively preparing for it. The goal of launching cultural and educational work throughout the army is: to strive to raise a large number of worker and peasant cadres and soldiers with very low education levels or complete illiteracy to the level of middle school or higher elementary school within three and a half years.

The broad masses of commanders and fighters, because they had been exploited and oppressed for a long time in the past, and were often in a combat environment after joining the army, did not have many opportunities to study culture, so their education level was very low. Due to the arrival of the victorious situation throughout the country, commanders and fighters encountered many difficulties in performing various local work and urban garrison tasks due to the limitations of their low education level. The commanders and fighters' demands for improving their cultural level are therefore becoming more and more urgent. The commanders and fighters seized the gaps during the execution of tasks and actively studied culture. The military region leadership has taken a series of steps in order to systematically carry out cultural and educational work throughout the army. In April, the political department of the military region issued instructions on strengthening basic education and cultural education throughout the army, and in early May, a meeting of senior cadres of the military region and a meeting on propaganda and education work of the military region were held to discuss the development of cultural and educational issues throughout the army and various preparations. The participants unanimously believed that: except for some troops still having advancement tasks and a considerable period of bandit suppression tasks, the Southwest Military Region troops have basically shifted from the war to the period of peaceful construction. It is necessary to systematically and step by step intensify the cultural and educational work of the troops, turning the million-strong army into a million-strong university, so that cadres and soldiers who had no educational opportunities in the past can turn over culturally.

According to the increasingly high cultural learning requirements of the broad masses of commanders and fighters and the current possible conditions, the political department of the Southwest Military Region has formulated a preliminary plan for cultural and educational work throughout the army. The specific goal is: within three years, cadres in the whole army who have the current higher elementary level will be raised to junior high school; soldiers will generally be raised to higher elementary level. Cadres throughout the army with a cultural level below junior high school will be rotated to study in the Military and Political University and its affiliated military sub-district branches for one year. The Military and Political University headquarters is responsible for training cadres above the battalion level in the whole army, the military sub-district branches train company and platoon cadres, and the military sub-district corps training instructors and soldiers. In one year of rotation training, three-quarters of the time is spent on cultural education, and one-quarter of the time is spent on military, political, and professional education. The subjects are stipulated as Chinese, general knowledge, and arithmetic. For on-the-job personnel who do not have a junior high school level: units above the regiment level establish cultural refresher schools for on-the-job cadres at all levels; in addition to necessary military training and political education for all soldiers, sufficient time is allocated to vigorously carry out cultural education. In addition to the troops and organs that have not been assigned bandit suppression tasks, which should gradually begin to carry out comprehensive cultural learning, all troops should make the following necessary preparations in the second half of this year:

(1) Establish and improve the organization of cultural education in the propaganda and education department, and enrich the cadres engaged in cultural education work.

(2) Actively carry out the work of eliminating illiteracy. Raise all illiterates to a cultural level that can read, write, and use 300 to 500 words, laying the foundation for the smooth development of cultural education next year.

(3) Carry out classified trials and gain experience. In addition to directly undertaking bandit suppression tasks and advancing troops, company schools, refresher schools, and military and political university rotation training classes should be trial-run separately in a planned and step-by-step manner.

(4) Train cultural teachers, requiring each company to be equipped with four cultural teachers.

All departments are actively carrying out preparatory work according to the above instructions.

　　西南军区积极准备
    开展全军大规模文教工作
    文化程度很低及不识字的干部和战士争取在三年半内达到高小或初中程度
    【新华社重庆九日电】人民解放军西南军区将于明年起展开全军大规模的文化教育工作，现正积极进行准备工作。展开全军文化教育工作的目标是：争取在三年半的时间内，把大批文化程度很低或完全不识字的工、农干部和战士提高到中学或高小的程度。
    广大的指战员们，因为过去长期受剥削和压迫，参军后又经常处于战斗环境中，学习文化的机会不多，所以文化程度很低。由于全国胜利形势的到来，指战员们在执行各项地方工作和城市警备任务中，受了文化程度低的限制，而碰到很多困难。指战员们提高文化程度的要求因而愈加殷切。指战员们抓紧了执行任务时的空隙时间，积极学习文化。军区领导方面为了有计划地展开全军文化教育工作，采取了一系列的步骤。四月间军区政治部发出关于加强全军基本教育和文化教育的指示，五月初召开了军区高级干部会议及军区宣传教育工作会议，讨论了开展全军文化教育问题及各项准备工作。参加会议的人一致认为：西南军区部队除部分尚有进军任务和相当一个时期的剿匪任务外，基本上已从战争转入和平建设时期，必须要有计划、有步骤地加紧部队的文化教育工作，将百万人的军队变成百万人的大学校，使过去没有受教育机会的干部和战士在文化上翻身。
    根据广大指战员日益高涨的文化学习要求与当前的可能条件，西南军区政治部拟定了全军文化教育初步计划。具体目标是：在三年内，全军干部现有高小程度者，提高到初中；战士则一般提高到高小程度。全军文化程度在初中以下的干部，轮流入军政大学及其所属各军区分校学习一年。由军政大学总校担任训练全军营以上干部，各军区分校训练连、排干部，各军分区的总队训练班长和战士。在一年轮训中，以四分之三时间进行文化教育，四分之一时间进行军事、政治、业务教育。课目规定为国文、常识、算术三门。未具备初中程度的在职人员学习方面：团以上单位设立各级在职干部文化补习学校；对全体战士除进行必要的军事训练及政治教育外，划出充分时间，大力开展文化教育。除未担任剿匪任务的部队与机关，应逐渐开始全面进行文化学习外，全体部队则应在今年下半年作好下列的必要的准备工作：
    （一）建立和健全宣传教育部门中文化教育的组织，充实文化教育工作的干部。
    （二）积极进行消灭文盲的工作。将所有文盲提高到能读、能写、能用三百字到五百字的文化程度，为明年顺利的开展文化教育打下基础。
    （三）分类试办，取得经验。除直接担任剿匪任务与进军部队以外，应有计划有步骤地分别试办连队学校、补习学校及军政大学轮训班。
    （四）培养文化教员，要求每个连队要配备四个文化教员。
    各部根据上述指示正积极进行准备工作。
