　　Zhang Yisheng of Yugou District, Huaiyin, Seizes the Wife of a Revolutionary Soldier
    Zhang Yisheng of Harbin Medical University Writes a Letter of Appeal
Editor:
    I was originally a soldier in the 6th Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment of the Independent Brigade of the New Fourth Army in Central China (enlisted in 1945). After the "August 15th" surrender of the Japanese invaders, I followed the troops into Northeast China. In the summer of 1947, I was wounded in the Changtu Campaign and came to the rear for recuperation (Qiqihar Army Hospital). After recovering from my injuries, I stayed in the rear to work due to poor health. I am currently a squad leader in the Surgical Hospital of Harbin Medical University.
    My original hometown is Penyao Village, Tianchang Township, Yugou District, Huaiyin County, Jiangsu Province. My father's name is Zhang Yugui, and he is 59 years old this year. My older brother is named Zhang Yixiang. I also have two younger brothers and a younger sister. There are a total of ten people in my family. Before "August 15th," we had 25 mu of land. Because the area has suffered from floods for many years, coupled with the looting and destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the past, my family is now living in extreme poverty.
    I have been in the army for five years since I joined. At the end of 1948, I began to communicate with my family, so the villagers all know that I am working in Harbin. However, Zhang Yisheng, the village's grain assistant, colluded with village cadres to change my family's status from military dependents to martyr's dependents, saying that I had already sacrificed myself, and seized my wife. On the 30th day of the third month of the lunar calendar this year, the local government asked my older brother to go to the county government to collect the martyr's dependents' preferential grain, which my family found very strange. My father said, "My son wrote a letter more than ten days ago. How could he have sacrificed himself now?" He showed them the photo, but they ignored it. My father went to the district and county to check the rosters and found that my family had been changed to martyr's dependents. Later, he negotiated with the county, asking them to change the martyr's dependents back to military dependents, but the county ignored him. So my father went home without collecting the martyr's dependents' preferential grain. After Zhang Yisheng seized my wife, he asked my wife to collect the martyr's dependents' preferential grain, but she did not receive the grain because she did not have a martyr's dependents' certificate. Later, Zhang Yisheng spread rumors, saying that the grain had already been collected by my father and stored elsewhere, and asked my wife to demand the grain from my family. My family did not collect the grain, so what could we give her? So they make trouble with my family every day. My family sought help from the township government, but they did not intervene. In addition, the 117th Division distributed military dependents' grain in Huaiyin some time ago, and my family received 30 jin of wheat. Later, Zhang Yisheng insisted that my family had received 1,000 jin and said that my family was not military dependents and wanted to take the grain back, forcing my older brother to attempt suicide.
    Zhang Yisheng colluded with village cadres to spread rumors and oppress my family, and seized my wife. He should be punished by law. I hope the newspaper will publish this letter and notify the Huaiyin County government to conduct a serious investigation and punish Zhang Yisheng and the illegally acting cadres according to law. If the Huaiyin County government continues to adopt the same indifferent attitude as before, I will appeal to the Central People's Court.

    Editor's Note: Regarding the situation described by Comrade Zhang Yisheng, please the Huaiyin County Government take responsibility for investigating and handling it, and please publish the investigation and handling results in this newspaper.

### 淮阴虞沟区张肄成霸占革命军人的妻子  哈尔滨医大张肄胜来信申诉

　　淮阴虞沟区张肄成霸占革命军人的妻子
    哈尔滨医大张肄胜来信申诉编辑同志：
    我原是华中新四军第三师独立旅第三团二营六连的战士（一九四五年参军）。“八一五”日寇投降后随部队挺进东北。一九四七年夏季，我在昌图战役中负伤来后方休养（齐齐哈尔陆军医院）。伤愈后因身体不好，留在后方工作。现在哈尔滨医科大学外科医院任班长。
    我的原籍是江苏省淮阴县虞沟区天长乡盆窑村。我父亲叫张玉贵，今年五十九岁。哥哥叫张肄祥。还有两个弟弟，一个妹妹。我家里一共有十口人，“八一五”前有地二十五亩。因为当地连年遭受水灾，又加上过去蒋匪抢掠、破坏，现在家里生活十分困难。
    我自参军至今已将五年。一九四八年底我开始与家里通信，因此村里的老乡都知道我在哈尔滨工作。但是本村的财粮助理员张肄成，与村干部串通一起，将我家由军属改为烈属，说我已经牺牲了，并将我的老婆霸占去了。今年阴历三月三十日，当地政府叫我哥哥去县政府领烈属优待粮，我家很觉诧异。我父亲说：“十余天前，我的儿子还来过信，现在怎么就会牺牲了？”并将像片拿给他们看，他们不理会。我父亲又到区里、县里去查名册，发现都把我家改成了烈属。后来向县里交涉，请他们把烈属改为军属，县里也不理睬。于是我父亲也没领烈属优待粮就回家了。张肄成把我的老婆霸占后，又叫我的老婆去领烈属优待粮，但她因为没有烈属证明书，没有领到粮。后来张肄成就造谣，说粮食已经由我父亲领回，存放别处去了，叫我老婆向我家要粮食。我家没有领粮，拿什么给她呢？所以他们每天和我家里闹。我家找乡公所处理，他们也不过问。此外，前一个时候一一七师到淮阴发放军属粮时，我家曾领回三十斤小麦。后来张肄成硬说我家领了一千斤，并说我家不是军属，要把粮食要回去，逼得我哥哥要自杀。
    张肄成和村干部串通一起，造谣压迫我家里，霸占我的老婆，应该受到法律的制裁。我希望报纸将这封信发表，并通知淮阴县政府认真调查，依法惩办张肄成及非法胡为的干部。如果淮阴县政府还是采取以前那样不闻不问的态度，我就要向中央人民法院申诉。
                        哈尔滨医科大学外科学院  张肄胜
    编者按：关于张肄胜同志所说的情况，请淮阴县政府负责调查处理，并望将调查及处理结果在本报公布。
