　　Sun Baolai's Creation
　　A Record of the Creation of Storage Batteries for Passenger Car Lighting

　　Sun Baolai is currently the Chief of Vehicle Electricity at the Beijing Inspection Section of the Tianjin Railway Administration. He is fifty-one years old this year. The reactionary rule buried this honest engineer for half his life, but the Communist Party turned him around. With his wisdom and experience, he created storage batteries for passenger car lighting, saving the people millions of catties of millet, and was awarded the title of Special-Class Model Worker.

　　Storage batteries are an indispensable component of passenger car lighting equipment; lights and electric fans cannot do without them. However, before liberation, these storage batteries were always ordered from outside sources, which were not only expensive but also scarce, often resulting in dim lights in passenger cars at night. The shortage of storage batteries became a serious problem on the trains. At that time, the Kuomintang Railway Bureau also wanted to solve this problem and found Sun Baolai, who only held the empty title of assistant engineer without any real power, and a few others, asking them to specialize in the research and manufacture of storage batteries. However, the funding was already insufficient, and on top of that, it was further reduced by deductions, and workers were not allowed to help him. In fact, this old engineer, who was not tall and had graying hair, had long been disillusioned with the Kuomintang's ways. Since the teens of the Republic of China, he had new inventions in electrical engineering, which were sent to the then Ministry of Communications several times. Unexpectedly, they were all rejected with the four words "inconsistent with principles." However, soon after, these "inconsistent with principles" inventions became new inventions of the Ministry of Communications. Sun Baolai knew in his heart: "Even if I can achieve something this time, wouldn't it just become a stepping stone for the directors and section chiefs to climb up!" Therefore, no one was enthusiastic about this work, and they perfunctorily made a few units to submit, which lost their effectiveness in a few days.

　　After liberation, the working class became the masters of the country. Thanks to the correct leadership of the People's Government, although Sun Baolai remained as silent as before, his heart was very excited. Leading this research work, he not only received more adequate funding and tools, but also had eight workers to help him. Everyone actively innovated and overcame difficulties. The electric troughs and negative plates in the manufacture of storage batteries could be made from the old ones, but the positive plates brought them difficulties. Although they could be made by themselves, the most important raw material, red lead powder, was not easy to obtain. It was hard to buy good quality red lead powder, and using pure lead was too expensive. At this time, Sun Baolai brought into play the wisdom that had been buried by the reactionaries for decades. He saw that the used positive plates from storage batteries were either used to fill earth pits or discarded like garbage, which was a pity. He thought: If these waste positive plates could be reduced, the problem of red lead powder would be solved. He came up with this idea and started experimenting according to scientific principles. He experimented dozens of times without success, but the lessons learned from the failures led him to a correct understanding of the relationship between temperature, time, and the combination of reducing agents for converting lead sulfate back to lead oxide. At the same time, he also made appropriate improvements to the smelting furnace and other tools. Under his continuous research and experimentation, the waste positive plates were reduced to red lead powder, and then this red lead powder was used to make new positive plates, and the experiment was finally successful. Not only did it save a lot of time, but each storage battery was also cheaper than ordering from outside by more than 13,000 catties of millet. If all the railways in the country used this type of storage battery, it would save more than 10 million catties of millet annually.

　　This new creation immediately received attention from railway bureaus in various regions. The Northeast Railway Bureau even sent four technicians to Beijing in July last year to learn from them. From May last year to the end of May this year, they have manufactured 119 storage batteries, which have all been installed and used on the trains. To expand production, five more workers were added in January this year. In June this year, they also received a large order from the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, and therefore started to establish a factory specializing in the manufacture of storage batteries. Now, in addition to completing the original plan to produce 200 storage batteries this year, they can also produce another 300 units after the new factory is established and can use completely new materials. At the same time, he is also studying the self-manufacture of a "spray-type powder making machine" specifically for extracting red lead powder from pure lead to save raw material costs.

　　Sun Baolai, who has studied electrical industry for decades, does not smoke, does not drink, and does not like any entertainment such as listening to operas or watching movies, and he does not like to talk much either. In his silent and simple life, he longed for a job position that could utilize all his specialties, but he did not get it until after the liberation of Beijing. Although he is already fifty-one years old, he does not admit that he is old. He said, "I have lived for half my life, and now is the real beginning of my work. After the factory is built, I plan to study something else." In this way, Sun Baolai, with his wisdom, created storage batteries to bring light to the night-time train carriages. This is an extremely valuable contribution to the people. In January this year, at the Tianjin Railway Administration's commendation meeting, he was selected as a Special-Class Model Worker. The plate-making group under his leadership also won a big red flag in May this year, with the words: "Engineer and workers cooperate to promote the spirit of collective creation."

　　孙宝来的创造
    记客车照明用蓄电池创造经过
    柯夫
    孙宝来现任天津铁路管理局北京检车段车电主任，今年五十一岁了，反动统治把这个老实的工程司埋没了半辈子，共产党使他翻了身。他以智慧和经验创造了客车照明用的蓄电池，为人民节省下千百万斤小米，荣获了特等功臣的称号。
    蓄电池是客车照明设备上一种不可缺少的器材，电灯、电扇都离不了它。但是这种蓄电池，在解放前，一向是在外面订购的，不但价钱贵，而且货又少，往往弄得客车在晚间电灯不亮，蓄电池的缺乏，成了车上的严重问题。当时国民党的铁路局也曾想要解决，找到那时仅有帮工程司的空名，而无实权的孙宝来等几个人，叫他们专门研究制造蓄电池。可是经费本来就不够，还加上克扣，并且不让工友帮助他。其实，这位个子不高，头发斑白的老工程司，对国民党的那一套，早就伤透了心：从民国十几年起他对电气方面就有了新的创造，几次送到当时的交通部去，不料都被“不合原理”四个大字批驳下来，可是不久，这些“不合原理”的创造，竟都成了交通部的新发明。孙宝来心里明白：“这次纵然能做出成绩来，还不也是成了主任和段长们向上爬的垫脚石！”所以对这个工作，谁也不起劲，敷衍着做了几台交差，使不几天就失掉作用了。
    解放以后，工人阶级当了家，由于人民政府正确的领导，虽然孙宝来仍如往日一样的沉默寡言，但他的内心却十分振奋。由他领导这个研究工作，不但得到了较充足的经费和工具，而且还有八个工友帮助他。大家积极的创造，克服困难。制造蓄电池中的电糟、阴极板都可以利用旧的，但是阳极板却给他们带来了困难，虽然自己也可以造，可是最主要的原料红铅粉却不易得到，好的买不到，用纯铅制又太贵。这时孙宝来就发挥了被反动派埋没了几十年的智慧，他看到用过的蓄电池中的废阳极板，在从前，不是填了土坑，就是和垃圾一样的抛掉，很可惜。他想：如果能将这些废阳极板还原，红铅粉的问题就解决了。他想出这个法子，便按照科学原理试验起来，一连试验了几十次却没有成功，但是，由于失败的教训，使他从温度、时间、硫酸铅返为氧化铅还原剂的配合上，摸到了一条正确的规律，同时把炼丹炉等工具，也作了适当的改进。在他不断的研究试验下，废阳极板还原为红铅粉，再用这种红铅粉制成新的阳极板，终于试验成功了。做起来不但很省时间，而且一台蓄电池，比在外订购的价格便宜一万三千多斤小米。如果全国铁路都使用这种蓄电池，每年可节省小米一千万斤以上。
    这个新的创造，立刻得到各地铁路局的重视，东北铁路总局在去年七月，还特派四位技工到北京来向他们学习。从去年五月到今年五月底止，他们已造出了蓄电池一百一十九台，都已装到车上使用。为了扩大生产，今年一月又增添了五位工友，今年六月，又接受了铁道部材料局大批订货，因此着手建立一个专门制造蓄电池的厂子。现在，他们除了要完成今年原计划生产二百台蓄电池的任务外，在新厂建立后，还能再生产三百台，且可以完全使用新的材料。同时，他又在研究自己制造一架“喷雾式制粉机”，专门做从纯铅中提炼红铅粉之用，以节省原料成本。
    研究了几十年电气工业的孙宝来，不吸烟，不喝酒，听戏、看电影等一切的娱乐他都不爱，而且也不爱多说话。在沉默简朴的生活里他就是渴望着一个能够发挥他所有特长的工作岗位，但是，直到北京解放后他才得到。虽然他已五十一岁的年纪，但他并不服老，他说：“活了半辈子，现在才是真正工作的开始，等到工厂搞好了，我准备再研究点别的。”就这样，孙宝来以他的智慧，创造了蓄电池使夜行的车厢里得到了光明，这是对人民极可珍贵的贡献。在今年一月间，天津铁路管理局庆功大会上，他被选为特等功臣。在他领导下的制板组，也在今年五月里荣获了一面大红旗，上面写着：“工程司与工友合作，发扬集体创造精神。”
