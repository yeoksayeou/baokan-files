To the Beloved Chairman Mao:
We are holding our Third People's Representatives Conference. At the meeting, we summarized our production and disaster relief work last year. The representatives all felt that the broad masses were able to overcome the famine victoriously under the severe flood situation last year due to your wise leadership and the Central People's Government's kind concern.

Last year, when the flood was severe and the broad masses of the people were at their wit's end, you pointed out a way out for us: "Production for self-salvation, thrift for famine relief." On the one hand, the People's Government vigorously helped us to develop sideline and handicraft production; on the other hand, it called for the large-scale planting of wheat, lending one million jin of wheat seeds, solving the masses' difficulties in planting wheat. The government also lent disaster-stricken people production funds. In March alone, according to the statistics of eleven districts, namely the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 14th districts: a total of 3,005 households and 5,492 people participated in weaving mats, with 2,000 mats produced daily. 887 looms were in operation, producing 1,542 bolts of homespun cloth daily. A total of 14,139 spinning wheels were in operation, producing 3,888 jin of thread daily. Villages also developed production such as boiling saltpeter, transportation and sales, and flour mills. A total of 43,523 people participated in these productions, with an average daily profit of 29,969 jin of corn. Supply and marketing cooperatives systematically purchased products, supplied raw materials, and helped solve sales difficulties. In addition to providing relief to the elderly, widowed, and disabled, the county government also organized production centers for the disabled and elderly. In this way, we were able to overcome the famine and ensure the smooth progress of this year's spring plowing.

Since the beginning of spring, more than 120,000 mu of spring barley and other early-maturing crops have been sown. In response to the government's call to plant cotton, the masses planted cotton in peanut, sweet potato, and sesame fields, expanding the cotton fields by 650 mu, exceeding the cotton planting plan of 150,000 mu. The large fields have also been universally planted and seedling hoeing has begun. Wheat fields have generally been hoed twice, and some have been hoed three to four times, and work has been carried out to eliminate pests. Combining agricultural and sideline production, the county has planted 415,956 trees. In order to prevent spring epidemics, doctors were organized to go to the countryside and vaccinate 172,134 people against smallpox. The wheat harvest is approaching, and we have the confidence to overcome the famine.

Our Third People's Representatives Conference is discussing the work of protecting wheat, requisitioning grain, summer plowing, summer weeding, and summer hoeing to ensure that the tasks are completed on schedule. We will respond to your concern for us with practical work. We wish you good health!

　　写给敬爱的毛主席
    武清县各界人民代表报告生产救灾工作敬爱的毛主席：
    我们正在召开第三届各界人民代表会议。会上总结了我们去年的生产救灾工作。代表们都感到：在去年水灾严重的情况下，广大群众能够胜利度过灾荒，是由于您的英明领导及中央人民政府的亲切关怀。
    去年当水灾严重，广大老百姓正走头无路之际，您给我们指出了一条活路：“生产自救、节约度荒”。人民政府一方面大力帮助我们开展副业、手工业生产；另一方面号召大量种麦，贷放麦种一百万斤，解决了群众的种麦困难。政府又贷给灾民生产资金。在三月份内，仅据二、三、五、六、七、八、九、十、十一、十四等十一个区的统计：参加织席的户数共三千零五户、五千四百九十二人，每日出席二千片。织布机开动了八百八十七架，每日出土布一千五百四十二匹，开动的纺车共有一万四千一百三十九辆，每日出线三千八百八十八斤。各村并发展了熬硝、运销、粉房等生产。参加这些生产的有四万三千五百二十三人，平均每日获利二万九千九百六十九斤玉米。供销合作社则有计划的收购产品，供给原料，帮助解决销路困难。对孤老残疾者除进行救济外，县府并组织了残老生产所。这样就使我们度过灾荒，保证了今年春耕的顺利进行。
    入春以来，播种了春大麦及其他早熟作物十二万余亩。为响应政府种棉号召，群众在花生、山芋、芝麻地里种上了棉花，扩大棉田六百五十亩，超过了十五万亩的种棉计划。大田也普遍种上了，现已开始锄苗。麦田一般都锄过两遍，有的已锄过三至四遍，并进行了扑灭虫害的工作。结合农副业生产，全县植树四十一万五千九百五十六棵。为了防春疫，组织医生下乡给十七万二千一百三十四人种了痘。目前麦收将到，我们有信心度过灾荒。
    我们三届人民代表会议正在讨论护麦、征收、夏耕、夏耘、夏锄等工作，保证按期完成任务。我们将以实际工作回答您对我们的关怀。祝您健康！
                            武清县各界人民代表会全体代表启
                                              五月二十九日
