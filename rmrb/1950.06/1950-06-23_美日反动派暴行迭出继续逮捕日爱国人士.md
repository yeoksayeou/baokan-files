Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: The American and Japanese reactionaries, under the "crime" of "having the suspicion of spreading anti-American propaganda," continue to arrest and unreasonably interrogate Japanese patriots. According to a United Press report from Tokyo on the 20th: Police in Nonoshi, northern Honshu, arrested seven more union members who allegedly "spread anti-American propaganda." From the People's Congress in Tokyo on May 30th to the 20th, the total number of Japanese patriots arrested has reached forty-nine. According to Kyodo News, four workers, including Ohashi Shuji, who were involved in the so-called "open letter to MacArthur case," were handed over to the US military authorities by the Japanese police authorities, and the US military court began their trial on the 20th.
