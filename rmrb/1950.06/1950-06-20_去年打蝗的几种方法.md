　　Several Methods for Fighting Locusts Last Year
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ying Lin
　　I. Bed Sheet Eradication Method: There are two types of this method:
　　The first type involves using two bed sheets sewn together, with a small cloth bag attached between the seams of the two sheets. The bottom opening of the cloth bag is unfastened, ready to pour the driven locust nymphs into a pit. The method is to first place the bed sheet in the field with locust nymphs, then organize a group of people to surround an area of slightly more than a tenth of an acre from a distance of ten to twenty feet. The people around the perimeter of the area each hold two locust-driving tools (brooms, tree branches, paddles, feather dusters) and gradually close in. When all the locust nymphs have jumped onto the bed sheet, the people on all sides lift the sheet and shake it a few times, and the locust nymphs will naturally fall into the small cloth bag attached to the sheet. After doing this several times, when the small cloth bag contains several pounds of locust nymphs, the opening can be untied and buried in the soil. This method was promoted in Lin County, Pingyuan Province, last year and has been very effective. It can be adopted in various regions.
　　The second type is also the bed sheet eradication method, first organizing a group of people to surround the area. Then have two people hold up a bed sheet in front, with half of the bed sheet spread on the ground, ready to encircle. When surrounding, each person holds locust-driving tools in both hands and slowly advances, waving the tools close to the ground, driving the locust nymphs forward slowly. When all the locust nymphs have jumped onto the bed sheet, the two people holding the sheet fold it up and shake it a few times to kill the locust nymphs, then pour out the dead nymphs. It is best to wet the bed sheet, as the locust nymphs cannot jump easily on a wet sheet. If there are many people catching them, twelve people will need one bed sheet. The encirclement formation can be flexibly determined according to the terrain and the number of people. Regardless of the formation, the encirclement must be tight to prevent the locust nymphs from escaping. This method is suitable for exterminating small groups of jumping nymphs within five to six tenths of an acre, and is not suitable for large groups of locust nymphs.
　　II. Encirclement and Burning Method:
　　First, select a piece of land with locust nymphs. Spread a circle of wheat straw and dry grass in the middle of the land. The grass circle should be six feet in size. Then, spread a pile of straw in the very center of the grass circle. Then organize a large encirclement to gradually drive the jumping nymphs into the small pile of wheat straw, where they can be concentrated and burned to death. This method is most suitable for use in grasslands.
　　III. Pit-Digging and Burying Method:
　　First, dig rectangular pits in the field, three feet deep, four feet long, and one and a half feet wide. Then organize the locust nymph drivers into an encirclement, holding the locust-driving tools from a distance of ten to twenty feet, gradually encircling them towards the pit. When the jumping nymphs jump into the pit, quickly cover them with a layer of soil using shovels to bury the locusts alive. Alternatively, a layer of wheat straw can be laid in the pit first, and when the nymphs jump in, it can be lit with fire, which is easier than burying them with soil. If the land has seedlings, drive the nymphs along the ridges, not across them.

　　去年打蝗的几种方法
    英林
    一、布单剿灭法：这种剿法有两种：
    第一种是用两个被单对在一起，在两个被单缝间系上一个小布袋，布袋的下口是活的，准备赶进了蝗蝻往坑里倒。用法是先把被单放到有蝗蝻的地里，再组织一部分人，从一、二丈远包围过来，面积一分多大。地四周的人，每人拿着两个赶蝗工具（扫帚、树枝、拍子、毛扇），逐渐向里围缩，等到蝗蝻全跳上被单，四面的人，把单子提起来，振动几下，蝗蝻就自然的坠落到单子上系着的小布袋里。这样做几次，小布袋里有了数斤蝗蝻，就可以解开活口，埋到土里。这种方法去年在平原省林县已经推广，收效很大，各地可以采用。
    第二种是用布单剿灭法，先组织一部分人包围起来。另由两个人在前面张起被单，半个被单铺在地面，准备包剿。包围的时候，每人两手拿赶蝗工具，慢慢向前包围，挨地挥动武器，赶着蝗蝻徐徐向前，等到蝗蝻全跳上被单，由两头张被单的人，叠起摔几下，蝗蝻就死了，再把死蝻倒出来，最好把被单蘸湿，湿单子上蝗蝻跳不动。要是捕打的人数多，十二个人就需要一个被单，包围的队形，可以根据地形不同和人数多少，灵活决定。不论何种队形，包围都要严密，不能让蝗蝻漏了网，这个方法适合扑灭五六分以内的小群跳蝻，对于大群的蝗蝻就不适用了。
    二、包围火烧法：
    先选一片有蝗蝻的土地，土地中间撒好一圈麦秸和干草，草圈有六尺大，再在草圈正中心，撒上一堆秸草。另外组织一个大包围，逐渐把跳蝻赶进麦秸小堆里，就可以集中烧死，这个方法最适用在草地。
    三、刨坑填灭法：
    先在地里刨好长方形的土坑，深三尺长四尺，宽一尺半，再把赶蝗蝻的人组织成包围圈，从一二丈远拿着赶蝻的工具，逐渐向坑里包围，等到跳蝻跳进土坑里，很快用铁锹盖上一层土，把蝗蝻埋死。或在坑里，先一铺层麦秸，等蝻跳进去用火一点，比埋土省事。要是在有庄稼苗的地里，要顺着垅赶，不能横着赶。
