　　Assisting the Government in its Work
    A Record of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the Sixth District
    By our reporter Feng Zhong

    The People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the Sixth District of Beijing has concluded. The government and the people jointly discussed major issues of development and reform within the district, solved important problems concerning the health and welfare of district residents in a planned and focused manner, and passed over a thousand proposals. The conference also inspected the government's work and the work style of its staff, discussed the government's work plan, and established a broader and closer connection between the government and the people.

    These one hundred and seventy-one representatives were, before liberation, people who "had no voice and nowhere to air their grievances." Now, as representatives, they understand that they represent the people and are working with the government to discuss everyone's affairs. Therefore, they all feel a great sense of responsibility. Many district representatives gathered people's opinions through street representative forums, family visits, and individual talks. Chang Fuhong, a representative of iron industry workers, went to various factories to talk to workers and, whenever he had a moment at night school, asked everyone for their opinions. He submitted more than twenty suggestions on his own. Chen Peizhen, a representative of homemakers, already had gray hair but still worked tirelessly, visiting various homes. She also conducted thorough investigations in a practical manner to see if the opinions she received were accurate. Someone suggested that Wan Yuan Alley flooded when it rained and should be repaired. After she went to look at it, she concluded: the government's finances are not yet abundant, and there are many important things to be done. These small things can be done by ourselves, so why bother the government? She decided that after the meeting, she would lead by example and mobilize residents to repair it themselves.

    The Sixth District is densely populated with limited space and poor sanitation. Sewage and excrement are everywhere in the streets and alleys. Most of the district has dirt roads, which are muddy and difficult to travel after rain. Moreover, many houses have been in disrepair for years and are in danger of collapsing and injuring people. Therefore, most of the opinions focused on issues such as residents' health and welfare. Another part of the opinions was critical of the government's work and its staff. There were also many proposals regarding industry and commerce, taxation, public security, civil affairs, and other work. Even details such as who was illegally reselling silver dollars, which women were still being oppressed, and who was still engaging in bullying behavior were brought up in detail. The more than two thousand opinions were mostly constructive, and some of them were unknown to the government. Some the government was aware of, but not as concretely as the representatives presented them. This situation sufficiently illustrates the significance and role of the district people's representative conference.

    At the representative conference, the Sixth District Public Office and the Public Security Sub-bureau reported on their work over the past year and more, reviewed the shortcomings in their work, and reported on the work plans for the summer and autumn seasons of this year, inviting the representative conference to discuss them. This sincere, frank, and honest attitude deeply moved the representatives. Twenty-nine representatives spoke (and more than twenty other representatives were prepared to speak, but due to time constraints, submitted their comments in writing), unanimously expressing their support for their government and guaranteeing to convey the spirit of the meeting to the people, mobilizing all district residents to assist the government in building their new Sixth District. Resident Representative Yang Zhankui: "I am sixty-four years old. From the Qing Dynasty to before the liberation of Beijing, I have never seen ordinary people able to speak like this. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have been liberated. If we, the people, want to live and work in peace and enjoy a good life, we must assist the government in doing a good job. What the government cannot see or hear, we, the people, must say and do. This is the responsibility of the people."

    Comrade Peng Zhen's speech at the meeting gave the representatives many profound insights. The representatives expressed one after another that they would take the lead in helping the government with its work. Some residents still had the idea of "who dares to sue the government." After the meeting, they would convey Comrade Peng Zhen's speech to every resident.

    The representatives expressed great satisfaction with the achievements of this meeting. They said: This is the first time they have seen a meeting where what the ordinary people said really mattered. From now on, we will all work together with one heart, offer ideas, and find solutions. We can do anything well.

　　协助政府作好工作
    记六区各界人民代表会议
    本报记者  冯仲
    北京市第六区各界人民代表会议闭幕了。政府和人民共同商量区内应兴应革的大事，有计划、有重点地解决了区内居民卫生福利等重要问题，通过了一千多条提案；检查了政府工作及工作人员的作风；讨论了政府工作计划；使政府与人民建立了更广泛更密切的联系。
    这一百七十一名代表，在解放以前，都是“有话不能说，有苦无处诉”的人。他们现在当了代表，晓得自己是代表人民，和政府在一起，商量大家的事情。因此，都感到自己责任重大。许多区代表通过了街代表座谈会，家庭拜访，个别谈话等方式，搜集了人民的意见。铁工业工人代表常福鸿到各工厂去找工人谈，上夜校时，一得空，就向大家征求意见。他一个人就提出了二十多条意见。家庭妇女代表陈佩贞头发已经斑白，仍不辞劳苦，到各家拜访。并且实事求是地深入调查，看看自己得到的意见是否正确。有人提出万源夹道下雨积水，应加修整，她跑去看过以后，认为：政府财政还不充裕，又有许多大事要办，这些小事自己能办，何必麻烦政府？她决定开完会后，以身作则，发动居民自己来修。
    第六区地狭人稠，卫生设备很差，街巷到处有污水便溺；全区多土路，雨后积水，泥泞难行；更有许多房屋年久失修，随时有倒塌伤人的危险。所以，大部分意见是集中于居民卫生福利等问题。另一部分意见是对政府工作和工作人员的批评。对工商、税收、治安、民政等工作，也有不少提案。甚至谁家还在违法倒卖银元，谁家妇女仍受压迫，某人尚有恶霸行为，也都详细地提了出来。两千多条意见，多是富于建设性的，其中若干项是政府不知道的，有的政府虽然了解，但不如代表提出的具体。这种情况，已经足够地说明了区人代会的意义和作用。
    代表会议上，第六区公所和公安分局报告了过去一年多的工作，检讨了工作中的缺点，并报告本年度夏秋两季工作计划，请代表会讨论。这种诚恳、坦白、老老实实的态度，深深感动了各位代表。二十九个代表发言（另有二十多位代表准备发言，因时间关系，改用书面提出），一致表示拥护自己的政府，保证向人民传达会议精神，动员全区居民，协助政府建设自己的新六区。居民代表杨占魁：“我六十四岁了，从满清起到北京解放以前，从没有看到老百姓能像现在这样讲过话。在共产党、毛主席领导下，我们翻了身。我们民众要想安居乐业过好日子，就要协助政府做好工作。政府看不到、听不到的，我们民众就要说，就要做，这是人民的责任。”
    彭真同志到会讲话，给了代表们许多深切的启示。代表们纷纷表示：要起带头作用，帮助政府作事情。居民中还有“谁敢告衙门”的思想，开完会后，要把彭真同志的讲话，传达给每一个居民。
    代表们对这次会议的成绩，表示非常满意。他们说：像这样老百姓说了就算的会，还是头一次见到。今后我们众人一条心，出主意，想办法，什么事情也能办好的。
