　　Agricultural Water Conservancy Briefs
    After completing its inspection in the Central and Southern China region, the agricultural water conservancy inspection delegation led by Li Shucheng, Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, arrived in Hangzhou on the 9th. They will inspect agricultural water conservancy work in various parts of East China in the future. On the 10th, the delegation listened to a report from the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government on the province's agricultural production this spring, and divided into groups to understand the province's water conservancy work, cotton, hemp, special products, and pest control work.
    Due to the lack of rain since the beginning of summer, the paddy fields in the suburbs of Nanjing and the mountainous highlands in northern and southern Anhui have gradually shown signs of drought. Local governments have promptly led farmers to open sluice gates, dig ponds, drill wells, and use water wheels to irrigate the fields, and mobilized farmers in low-lying fields to help farmers in high-lying fields to implement relay water transportation. With the united efforts of the farmers, the drought situation has been effectively overcome.

　　农业水利简讯
    中央人民政府农业部李书城部长所率领的农业水利视察团，在中南区视察完毕后，已于九日到达杭州。今后将视察华东各地的农业水利工作。十日，该团在杭听取了浙江省人民政府对该省今春农业生产情况的报告：并分组了解该省水利工作、棉麻特产和治虫工作等情况。
    南京市郊及皖北、皖南等地山区高地，因入夏以来久未落雨，禾田渐呈干旱现象。各地人民政府及时领导农民开闸、挖塘、掘井、戽水灌溉田地，并发动低田户帮助高田户，实行接力车水。在农民团结奋斗下，克服旱象已见成效。
