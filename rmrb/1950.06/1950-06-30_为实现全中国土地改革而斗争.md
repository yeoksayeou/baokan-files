　　Strive to Realize Land Reform Throughout China

The eighth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on the 28th of this month adopted the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, and the report on land reform issues made by Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has also been published today together with the aforementioned Land Reform Law. These are two extremely important documents, of great historical significance to China, which is in the process of completing the New Democratic Revolution and gradually beginning construction.

Land reform is a fundamental element of the New Democratic Revolution, with anti-feudalism as one of its basic tasks. Its fundamental purpose is to transform the feudal system of land ownership into peasant land ownership, in order to liberate the rural productive forces and pave the way for the country's industrialization. The Common Program, in Articles 3 and 27, clearly stipulates this basic purpose of land reform, and the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report provide an even clearer explanation.

The necessity of reforming the feudal land system of old China is very obvious. The general situation was: landlords and rich peasants, who accounted for less than 10 percent of the rural population, owned about 70 to 80 percent of the land in the countryside; while poor peasants, farm laborers, and middle peasants, who accounted for about 90 percent of the rural population, owned only about 20 to 30 percent of the land in total. In the newly liberated areas, after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and three years of the Liberation War, the land situation had changed again. In some areas, land had become even more concentrated. In areas like Sichuan and others, the landlord class owned as much as 80 percent of the land. In other areas, land was more dispersed than in the past, such as in East China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Central South China, where landlords and rich peasants, including public land, owned about 50 to 60 percent of the land. Peasants in various places who leased land from landlords usually had to pay half of their harvest as rent, plus other various forms of extra-economic exploitation and transfer of burdens, which actually seized most of the peasants' harvest. As a result, peasants toiled all year round without getting enough to eat, while the landlord class lived a parasitic life. This situation fully demonstrates that the feudal system of land ownership "is the root cause of our nation's aggression, oppression, poverty, and backwardness, and a fundamental obstacle to our country's democratization, industrialization, independence, unification, and prosperity." (See the CCP Central Committee's resolution on the promulgation of the Outline Land Law of China, October 10, 1947.)

The Chinese peasant class, throughout the feudal dynasties, constantly resisted the feudal land ownership system, with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom being the largest in scale. However, in the past, the Chinese peasant class was unable to solve the land problem because it lacked correct leadership. Mr. Sun Yat-sen put forward the slogan "land to the tiller," but did not find the correct path to realize this demand. Only after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, did the solution to the land problem have a correct path.

For more than 20 years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese peasant class has carried out large-scale struggles to change the feudal system of land ownership into peasant land ownership, and has accumulated rich experience. How land reform mobilized peasants to actively support the revolutionary war and the revolutionary regime in these 20-plus years need not be elaborated here. What is particularly worth mentioning now is the role of land reform in developing production. Since Northeast China ended the revolutionary war relatively early, the role of land reform in production is even more obvious. After Northeast China basically completed land reform in the spring of 1948, agricultural production increased sharply. Agricultural production in 1949 was 13.2 million tons, while in 1950 it will be 18 million tons. Due to the increase in peasant productivity, the purchasing power of peasants has also greatly increased. It is estimated that the total value of peasants' purchasing power in Northeast China this year can reach 5.66 million tons, that is, peasants will have a surplus of one-third of their total output to exchange for other means of livelihood and production. Due to the increase in peasant purchasing power, the market for industrial products needed by the vast number of peasants has expanded sharply. In 1947, 800,000 bolts of cloth were sold in Northeast China, 1.2 million bolts in 1948, 3.2 million bolts in 1949, and 9 million bolts will be sold in 1950. In 1949, industrial production in Northeast China accounted for 35 percent of the total value of industrial and agricultural production, while in 1950 it will rise to 43 percent, which is inseparable from the role of agricultural development. Of course, the population density in the interior is higher than in Northeast China, and the land distributed to and potentially distributable to peasants is less than in Northeast China, so the growth of peasant purchasing power in the interior will not be as fast as in Northeast China, but the general trend is still the same.

The nationwide land reform, which will begin this winter and next spring, is expected to be completed in about three years, excluding minority areas temporarily, is not only unprecedented in Chinese history, but also unprecedented in the history of world revolution. It is planned that land reform will be implemented in areas with 100 million agricultural population this winter and next spring, and in areas with 160 to 170 million agricultural population next winter and spring. Implementing land reform simultaneously in areas with such a large population is equivalent to launching a revolution in many countries at the same time, which is a world-shaking event. This is also the most fierce economic and political war launched by the Chinese people against the remnants of the feudal system after the military victory. The victory of this war will effectively end the semi-feudal nature of Chinese society. Because this land reform is very large in scale, it is easy to cause confusion, so it must be carried out in a very step-by-step, orderly, and led manner, and it should avoid causing major damage. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's Government Committee have agreed to the CCP Central Committee's proposed policy of preserving the rich peasant economy in future land reform, and the land of small land leasers will also not be confiscated. This is an important decision. This decision first reduces the scope of attack of future land reform from about 8 percent of the rural population to 3 to 4 percent. In this way, another 3 to 4 percent of the rich peasants are neutralized, the landlord class is further isolated, and the middle peasants can be more assured of production. There is no doubt that this decision is very conducive to the early restoration of rural production after land reform, and is beneficial to the vast number of people. In the past revolutionary war period, the greatest interest of the people throughout the country was the victory of the revolutionary war. During the Soviet movement and the Liberation War period, in order to meet the demands of the poor and farm laborers as much as possible to support the revolutionary war, the surplus land and property of the rich peasants (who often attacked the peasants together with the landlords at that time) were confiscated and distributed to the landless and land-poor peasants, which was completely correct at that time. Now that the revolution has been won, the greatest interest of the people throughout the country is to restore and develop production as soon as possible. At this time, the rich peasant class, because the overall situation has been determined, can be neutralized, so it is also completely correct to adopt a new policy.

In order to complete the large-scale land reform in the future, it is necessary and entirely possible to organize a powerful anti-feudal united front on a national scale, so as to concentrate the democratic forces of the country and eliminate the feudal land system. The peasant class is the main force of the land revolution, and the peasant association, the peasant's own organization, is the executive organ of land reform. The working class should actively lead and assist the peasants in carrying out land reform, so as to expand and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie should also participate in and support the land reform movement, and should never hinder it. All democratic parties, people's organizations, institutions, and troops should actively help land reform. The enlightened elements of the landlord class should also recognize the general trend and not hinder the peasants' just demands for the distribution of landlord land. Land reform is a serious test for all democratic parties, people's organizations, institutions, troops, and individuals who support democracy, just as the past revolutionary war was a test for all people. All democratic forces should be able to withstand this test.

An unprecedentedly large-scale land reform will begin after this autumn, and all localities should make full preparations. After this land reform is completed, the national financial and economic situation will present a fundamental and favorable condition, and the people throughout the country should strive for this.

### 为实现全中国土地改革而斗争

　　为实现全中国土地改革而斗争
    中央人民政府委员会本月二十八日的第八次会议通过了中华人民共和国土地改革法，刘少奇副主席在人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议所作的关于土地改革问题的报告亦已与上述土地改革法在今日同时发表。这是两个极端重要的文件，对于正在完成新民主主义革命，逐步开始建设的中国，是有伟大历史意义的。
    土地改革，是以反封建为基本任务之一的新民主主义革命的一个基本内容。它的根本目的，是将封建剥削的土地所有制，改变为农民的土地所有制，以解放农村的生产力，为国家的工业化开辟道路。关于土地改革这一基本目的，在共同纲领第三条及第廿七条都有明确的规定，在中华人民共和国土地改革法和刘少奇副主席的报告中更有非常清楚的说明。
    旧中国的封建土地制度之必须改革，是很显然的。一般情形是：占有乡村人口不到百分之十的地主与富农，约占有农村中百分之七十到八十的土地；而约占有乡村人口百分之九十的贫农、雇农与中农，总共只占有约百分之二十至三十的土地。在新解放区，经过八年抗日战争与三年解放战争之后，土地情况又有变化，在有些地区，土地已更加集中，如四川及其他一些地区，地主阶级即占有土地百分之八十。在另一些地区，土地则比过去分散了些，如华东与中南长江下流一带，地主富农占有土地连公田在内，约占百分之五十至六十。各地农民承租地主的土地，通常的租率要占其收获物的一半，再加上其他各种超经济剥削及转嫁负担等，实际攫取了农民收获物的大部。因而农民终年劳动，不得一饱。而地主阶级则过着寄生生活。这种情况，充分说明封建剥削的土地所有制，“是我们民族被侵略、被压迫、穷困及落后的根源，是我们国家民主化、工业化、独立、统一及富强的基本障碍。”（见一九四七年十月十日中共中央关于公布中国土地法大纲的决议。）
    中国农民阶级，对于封建土地所有制，在封建时期各朝代中，曾经不断举行过反抗，而以太平天国的规模为最大。但是，在过去，中国农民阶级由于没有正确的领导，并没有能够解决土地问题。孙中山先生提出了耕者有其田的口号，但是没有找到实现这一要求的正确路线。只有在中国共产党成立之后，在毛泽东同志的领导下，土地问题的解决才有了正确的途径。
    二十余年来，中国农民阶级在中国共产党领导之下，为了改变封建剥削的土地所有制为农民的土地所有制，曾进行规模宏大的斗争，积累了丰富的经验。在这二十多年中，土地改革怎样动员了农民积极支持革命战争和革命政权，这里可以不多说。现在值得特别说明的是土地改革对于发展生产的作用。由于东北比较早地结束了革命战争，土地改革对于生产的作用就更加明显。东北于一九四八年春天基本上完成了土地改革之后，农业生产量急剧增加，一九四九年农业生产量为一千三百二十万吨，而一九五○年则将为一千八百万吨。由于农民生产力增大，因而农民的购买力也大大提高，预计今年东北农民的购买力总值可达到五百六十六万吨，即农民将有占其总产量三分之一的剩余农产品须要交换其他生活资料与生产资料。由于农民购买力的提高，故广大农民所需的工业品的市场猛烈扩大。一九四七年东北销售布匹为八十万匹，一九四八年为一百二十万匹，一九四九年为三百二十万匹，而一九五○年将为九百万匹。一九四九年东北工业生产占工农业生产总值的百分之三十五，而一九五○年将上升至百分之四十三，这和农业发展的作用是分不开的。当然，关内人口密度比东北高，农民分得与可能分得的土地比东北少，关内农民购买力的增长，不会有东北这样快，但是，总的趋势仍然是一样的。
    今冬明春开始的、预备在三年左右完成的、少数民族区域暂时除外的、全国性的土地改革，其规模之大，不但是中国历史上空前的，也是世界革命史上空前的。预定今冬明春要实行土地改革的，是一万万农业人口的地区，明冬后春要实行土地改革的，是一亿六、七千万农业人口的地区。在这样大量人口的地区内同时实行土地改革，在外国，等于在许多国家内同时发动革命，是一件翻天覆地的大事。这也是在军事上已经取得胜利之后，中国人民对于残余的封建制度所发动的一场最猛烈的经济的政治的战争。这场战争的胜利，将在实际上结束中国社会的半封建性质。由于这一次土地改革规模十分巨大，容易造成混乱，所以必须十分有步骤、有秩序、有领导地进行，应当避免造成重大破坏。人民政协全国委员会和中央人民政府委员会同意了中共中央所提出的在今后土地改革中的保存富农经济的方针，对于小土地出租者也不没收其土地，这是一个重要的决定。这一个决定，首先使今后土地改革的打击面由农村人口百分之八左右，减至百分之三、四。这样，另一个百分之三、四的富农被中立起来了，地主阶级就更加孤立了，中农就可以更加放心生产了。毫无疑问，这个决定非常有利于在土地改革之后，早日恢复农村生产的，对于广大人民是有利的。在过去革命战争时期，全国人民最大的利益是革命战争的胜利，苏维埃运动时期及解放战争时期，为了尽量满足贫雇农的要求，以支援革命战争，因此，没收富农（那时是经常与地主一道来向农民进攻的）多余的土地财产，分配给无地与少地的农民，这，在当时是完全正确的。现在，革命已经胜利，全国人民的最大利益是即早恢复与发展生产，这时的富农阶级，因为天下大势已定，已有可能被中立了，因此，采取新的方针，也是完全正确的。
    为了完成今后大规模的土地改革，必须而且完全可能组织全国规模的强大的反封建的统一战线，以使集中全国民主力量，消灭封建土地制度。农民阶级是土地革命的主力，农民自己的组织——农民协会是土地改革的执行机关。工人阶级应当积极领导与援助农民进行土地改革，以扩大与巩固工农联盟。小资产阶级、民族资产阶级也应当参加和赞助土地改革运动，而决不应当加以妨碍。一切民主党派、人民团体、机关、部队都应当积极帮助土地改革，地主阶级中的开明分子也应当认清大势，不妨碍农民的正义的分配地主土地的要求。土地改革对于一切民主党派、人民团体、机关、部队和表示拥护民主的个人，是一个严重的考验，与过去的革命战争对于所有的人们是一个考验一样。一切民主力量应当经得起这个考验。
    空前大规模的土地改革在今年秋后即将开始，各地应当作充分的准备。这一次土地改革完成之后，国家财政经济状况将出现一个根本性质的有利条件，全国人民应当为此而奋斗。
