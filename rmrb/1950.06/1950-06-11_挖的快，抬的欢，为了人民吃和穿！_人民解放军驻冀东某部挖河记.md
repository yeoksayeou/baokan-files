    "Dig Fast, Carry Joyfully, For the People's Food and Clothing!"
    A Record of the People's Liberation Army Digging a River in Jidong
    Xu Guangyao
    In the vast Bohai beach area of Ninghe County, Jidong, a river-digging unit of the People's Liberation Army, together with tens of thousands of civilian laborers, is excavating a new river channel – the New Dongyin River.
    The upper reaches of the New Dongyin River are the Chaobai River. Although the two rivers are only 150 kilometers apart, they are related to the lives of the people in eight counties. In the past, due to the criminal rule of the Kuomintang and the Japanese invaders, the river channels were in disrepair, causing floods and disasters. Last year alone, eight counties in Jidong were flooded, resulting in a loss of 500 million catties of grain.
    The people's army has always been at the forefront of creating benefits for the people. After the engineering plan of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government was issued, the river-digging unit of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army immediately arrived at the site. This is an army that is both good at fighting and capable of production, and they all have a history of supreme glory. There are heroic companies that have collectively won major merits twice in the Qingfengdian annihilation battle and the Taiyuan liberation campaign; there is the runner-up company of Cangxian Dengcheng; there is the third battalion of a certain regiment that made great contributions in the Xushui battle; there is the Yan Yaoqing class that made great contributions in the Huailai front-line defense battle;... These troops with supreme glory and brilliant achievements have, in the battles with the Japanese invaders and Chiang bandits, traveled all over the mountains and plains of North China; in a difficult and tense environment, they bravely and tenaciously attacked the enemy, and finally won complete victory. Now, they are using the same spirit and will, picking up shovels and hoes, and throwing themselves into the country's production and construction.
    When the troops arrived, the first difficulty they encountered was the environment: in this desolate beach that could not be seen at a glance, there were only four small villages within a radius of thirty miles, with a total of less than three hundred households. Not only did these tens of thousands of river-digging troops have no place to live, but even the drinking water was insufficient. However, shortly after they arrived, more than two hundred and ninety mat sheds were built along the river channel. The soldiers unloaded their things, built boards inside, and set up bunks. There were no stoves for cooking, so the soldiers did it themselves, mixed mud and made adobe, and set up the stove platforms next to the mat sheds. There was no water to drink, so the soldiers organized themselves to carry some river water from three miles away to drink when the tide was low. The troops stationed in the villages, in order to avoid competing with the villagers for water, placed sentries at the wellheads to let the villagers draw water first, and then the troops were allowed to draw water, absolutely ensuring that the villagers had enough water to drink. In just two or three days, the originally desolate wilderness had become lively, like a bustling town.
    The work of digging the river began! On this seven-mile-long section, thousands of iron shovels were waving, shining brightly in the sun; the carrying baskets filled with soil made a creaking sound on thousands of carrying poles. The soldiers, barefoot, shuttled back and forth. Slogans, songs, gongs and drums, and broadcasts were spreading everywhere, and hundreds of award flags won in battle were planted all over this vast wilderness. "Dig fast, carry joyfully, for the people's food and clothing!" This is a "carrying pole poem" circulating among the soldiers.
    In the first few days, more than twenty people in a certain regiment had blood marks on their shoulders; swollen shoulders were even more common. However, they washed them with pepper water or boiling water and continued to work until their shoulders were refined into black cocoons. A class of the Sixth Company of a certain regiment, except for one soldier, all had swollen legs, but they still worked as usual, maintaining an average level of 2.67 cubic meters of soil per person. The Second Machine Gun Company soldiers Huang Liuzi and Wang Jishun carried 240 baskets of soil every day, about ten cubic meters, on a round trip of one mile. And four soldiers of the Ninth Company of a certain regiment could actually carry 6.25 cubic meters of soil per person per day!
    The cadres and combat heroes in the army, who used to charge ahead in battles, are now taking the lead in river digging and production, also demonstrating their leading role and noble qualities. General Ma Long, who carried a machine gun for the soldiers and carried a marching pot for the cook over the Five Ridges during the advance into Chahar-Suiyuan in 1948, is now carrying soil baskets with the soldiers, shuttling on the long river slope. Zhou Yuwen, the meritorious company commander of the Ninth Company of a certain regiment, worked with the soldiers from the start, and would not let others replace him even when his feet were swollen. Communist Party members have always been models for completing tasks, and river digging is no exception. For example, Zhang Heidan, a soldier of the Second Guard Company of a certain regiment, has not left the carrying pole since he started work, and has been carrying soil in the wind and rain. Once, because of illness, he only ate two small steamed buns, and still went to dig, and after the leaders found out, they advised him to rest, but he resolutely shook his head; next time he ate, he forced himself to eat more, fearing that if he ate less, the higher-ups would "interfere" with his work.
    On April 14th, it suddenly started to rain, and everyone's clothes were soaked in sweat and rain all at once. The riverbed was muddy and slippery, and it was very difficult to walk. Some people carrying baskets slipped down the slope; some people digging soil were immersed in the water; some people had stomach pains. However, the soldiers said: "Bearing a shower of rain can exchange for the eternal happiness of the people of Jidong not being flooded, which is worth more than anything!" Some said: "The past gunfire couldn't stop us from charging, can a little rain stop us from digging the river?!" So they ignored the cold sea wind, ignored the rain pouring on their heads, fell and climbed up, dug into the water when the water was deep, and three people carried what two people could not carry up the slope; if one shovel couldn't dig it, they used two shovels. They worked harder and harder in the rain, and some even beat clappers and recited ditties. On this night, the soldiers' mat sheds leaked, and many of their coats and quilts were wet, but our soldiers did not complain. After repairing the leaks, those who could squeeze in slept together; those who could not squeeze in sat up all night wrapped in half-wet quilts.
    New problems then arose. It rained continuously for two days and two nights. The civilian laborers digging the river together in the adjacent section, due to lack of experience and insufficient preparation, their mat sheds had long been leaking and uninhabitable, and there were no villages nearby to turn to. Also, because there was no dry firewood, they had not been able to cook for two days, so they transferred to a certain town. The rain made the road slippery, and it was very difficult to walk. Although the county and district cadres helped to find ways, many elderly and frail civilian laborers could not withstand the cold and hunger, fell ill, and could not get up after falling in the mud: the situation was quite serious. After hearing about this, the production command post of the unit immediately notified the regiments by telephone, ordering the troops to immediately dispatch to rescue. All units quickly established rescue teams, put on carts, carried lanterns, and braved the cold wind and dense rain to go to the wilderness and mud to greet and search, leading those who could walk back to their mat sheds, and helping those who could not walk onto the carts to pull them back. Many comrades did not wait for the carts, but carried the civilian laborers on their backs, carrying them back from several miles away. Several cultural teachers from the Third Battalion of a certain regiment, wearing wet clothes, carried lanterns and shouted all night. The comrades at home quickly boiled water and cooked food, clearing out the mat sheds and drying clothes for the civilian laborers. Doctor Zhang Xiliang, with three health workers, gave medicine and injections to the sick civilian laborers, performed artificial respiration, and washed their bodies with warm water. Many cadres and soldiers took out their own unwet quilts and coats to put on the civilian laborers. They also mobilized the local villagers to clear out their houses and boil water to treat the civilian laborers together. The entire army rescued 857 distressed civilian laborers overnight, 27 of whom were seriously ill. Many civilian laborers were so grateful that they did not know what to do. With tears in their eyes, they said: "We can't repay your kindness. We can only work harder when digging the river!" Afterwards, the troops received many letters from the civilian laborers, expressing that they would learn from the People's Liberation Army's spirit of mutual assistance in loving the people, and would work with the troops to resolutely complete the river digging task!
    On the other hand, the People's Liberation Army is not only an army good at fighting and laboring, but also an army that loves culture. This is manifested in river digging as the close combination of cultural entertainment and labor. On the river slope, each company has an "activity club," which is a small shed temporarily surrounded by mats and soil. Inside, there are wall newspapers, books, musical instruments, blackboards, broadcast loudspeakers, and all the necessary equipment for cultural activities. Each company also has a cultural entertainment group organized by the soldiers themselves, which compiles and performs the characters and stories of their own company. Whenever they rest, gongs and drums immediately sound throughout the river construction section, making it lively. The club's wall newspapers and books are read by everyone; the new characters on the blackboard are read by everyone; the comrades of the broadcasting team are shouting the achievements and model figures of each class with loudspeakers; the storytelling and rap groups are singing foreign films and clapper talks. Some people put two eyes on the dirt basket, drape a blanket over it, and tie a tail on their buttocks, and perform "lion dance" on the spot. The soldiers are not only in good spirits, but also making progress in culture. Zhang Qinglin, the machine gun company commander of the Second Battalion of a certain regiment, has learned 260 new characters since digging the river for a month; Zhou Yuwen, the company commander of the Sixth Company of the same battalion, has also learned 240 new characters. And almost every soldier of a certain regiment keeps a diary (the literacy class writes a "literacy diary"). The wall newspaper of the Fourth Company received 146 submissions in a week, and usually receives more than 80 submissions every day. The wall newspaper committee of the Fourth Company of a certain regiment also received more than 100 clapper talks in one day. Judging from these simple figures alone, one can imagine how active and extensive the cultural activities of this river-digging unit are! Some people compare this place to a regular "temple fair," but a soldier's "River Digging Fun" clapper talk says it more sincerely: "Rest bell rings, put down shovels and baskets; take out pens, put down paper; compile stories and learn characters, keep diaries regularly; the People's Army, a model school!" Indeed, the People's Liberation Army, whether in combat or production, is a "model school" with a high degree of organization and discipline.
    Now, the soldiers are still working tensely and happily on this seven-mile-long section. Since they started work on April 6, the record of an average of 1.23 cubic meters of soil per person per day has gradually risen to three cubic meters and above. The total number of more than 600,000 cubic meters of soil work has been completed more than half. The soldiers are preparing to show how much striking power they have, launch the final competition, and strive to complete the work victoriously before June 10. With the joint efforts of tens of thousands of civilian laborers, a brand-new and wide river channel, symbolizing the welfare of the people of eight counties in Jidong, will soon appear on this vast Bohai Bay, and the evil flood disaster that has harmed the lives and property of the people of eight counties for years will also be thrown into the sea with the torrent of the new river channel and never return.

    “挖的快，抬的欢，为了人民吃和穿！”
    人民解放军驻冀东某部挖河记
    徐光耀
    在冀东的宁河县境广漠的渤海滩上，有一支人民解放军的挖河部队，配合着数万民工，正开挖一条新的河道——新东引河。
    新东引河的上游是潮白河。两河连接虽不过一百五十公里，却关系着八个县份人民的生活。过去由于国民党和日寇的罪恶统治，河道失修，致洪水泛滥成灾，仅去年一次，冀东八县被淹，就损失了粮食达五万万斤。
    人民的军队始终都是站在为人民造福的最前线的。当中央人民政府水利部的工程计划下来之后，人民解放军某部的挖河部队立即开到了现场。这是一支既长于战斗又能生产的军队，他们都有着无上光荣的历史。这里有清风店歼灭战和解放太原战役两次集体立大功的英雄连队；有沧县登城的亚军连；有在徐水战斗中立大功的某团三营；有怀来前线保卫战立大功的阎耀清班；……。这些有着无尚光荣和辉煌战绩的部队，在和日寇、蒋匪的战斗中，踏遍了华北的山地和平原；在艰苦紧张的环境中，英勇顽强地打击敌人，终于最后夺得了全部胜利。而今，他们又以同样的精神和意志，拿起锨镐，投入国家的生产建设了。
    部队一来，第一个遇到的是环境的困难：在这一眼望不到边的荒凉的海滩上，方圆三十里以内只有四个小村庄，总共还不上三百户人家。这上万的挖河部队不仅没有住处，连吃水都不够。但是，他们刚来不久，沿着河道便有二百九十多座席棚搭起来了。战士们卸下东西，在里面搭起板子，设下床铺。作饭没有锅灶，战士们自己下手，和泥脱坯，把锅台盘在席棚的旁边。没有水吃，战士们就组织起来，趁海水退潮的时候，从三里以外担些河水来吃。住在村里的部队，为了避免与老乡抢水，在井口上放了岗哨，让老乡们先打，然后才许部队打，绝对保证老乡们有足够的水吃。只两三天之间，原来一片荒凉的旷野，已变成热热闹闹，犹如一个繁华的市镇了。
    挖河的工作开始了！在这七里长的地段上，千万把铁锨舞动着，在阳光下闪闪发亮；装满了泥土的抬筐，在千万条抬杠上发出吱呀吱呀的响声。战士们光着脚板，穿梭似地来来往往。口号声、歌唱声、锣鼓声、广播声，到处在传播，千百面在战斗中获得的奖旗，插遍这辽阔的原野上。“挖的快，抬的欢，为了人民吃和穿！”这是流传在战士中的“扁担诗”。
    某团开初几天有二十多人的肩膀压出了血；肿肩膀的则更是普遍。可是，他们用花椒水或开水洗一洗，继续工作下去，直到把肩膀炼成黑色的茧子。某团六连有一个班，除了一个战士之外，全部都肿了腿，还是照样干，保持着平均每人两方六七土的水平。二机连战士黄六子和王吉顺，往返一里路，每天抬二百四十筐土，约合十方。而某团九连有四个战士，竟每人每天可抬土六·二五方！
    部队中的干部和战斗英雄，过去在战斗中冲锋陷阵，走在前头；今日挖河生产，也同样表现了他们的带头作用和高贵的品质。四八年察绥进军中，曾为战士扛机枪，为炊事员背行军锅爬越五回岭的马龙将军，今天又和战士一起，抬了土筐穿梭在长长的河坡上了。某团九连大功连长周玉文，从上工就和战士们一条杠子抬，脚累肿了还不让别人换。共产党员们一向是完成任务的模范，挖河也照例如此。譬如：某团警二连战士张黑旦自上工以来就没有离开过杠子，风里、雨里一直在抬。有一次因病他只吃了两个小馒头，又照样去挖了，领导同志发觉后劝他去休息，他坚决的摇着头；下次吃饭时却勉强自己多吃了些，怕吃少了，上级又会“干涉”他的工作。
    四月十四日，天忽然下起雨来，汗淋雨浇，每个人的衣服一下子全湿透了。河床上泥陷路滑，十分难走，有些抬筐的从坡上滑倒了；有些挖土的浸入了水里；有些人肚子痛起来。可是，战士们却说：“挨一会雨浇，能换来冀东人民不挨水淹的永远幸福，这比什么都值得！”有的说：“过去的枪林弹雨挡不住我们冲锋，今天一点小雨能挡住我们挖河？！”于是他们不顾海风的寒冷，不顾雨水浇头，跌倒了爬起来，水深了下水去挖，两个人不能抬上坡的就三个人抬；一锨铲不下的用两锨铲。冒着雨越干越欢，有的竟打着刮达板念起顺口流来。就在这一夜，战士们的席棚淋漏了，大衣被子很多的漏湿了，但我们的战士没有叫苦，把漏洞补好之后，能挤下的挤着睡了；不能挤的就围上半湿的被子坐了一夜。
    新的问题接着发生了。雨一连下了两天两夜，在邻近地段共同挖河的民工，由于经验不多，准备不足，他们的席棚早已漏的住不得，附近又没有村子可投，又因没有干柴，两天中未能起火吃饭，他们便向某市镇转移；雨淋路滑，十分难走，虽经县、区干部帮助设法，但仍有不少年老力衰的民工，经不住寒冷冻饿，发生疾病，跌在泥水中爬不起来：情势相当严重。该部生产指挥所听到这件事情后，立即用电话通知各团，命令部队马上出动抢救。各单位都迅速成立了抢救组，套上大车，提着灯笼，冒着寒风密雨，到荒野的泥水里，一面招呼，一面寻找，走得动的就领回自己的席棚来，走不动的就扶上大车拉回来。许多同志等不上大车，就把民工背在身上，从几里路外背回来。某团三营几个文化教员，穿着水湿的衣裳，提着灯笼，遍地喊了一夜。在家的同志们连忙烧水作饭，给民工腾席棚、烤衣服。医生张希良带着三个卫生员，给生病的民工吃药打针，施行人工呼吸法，用温水洗身子。很多干部、战士拿出自己未湿的被子大衣，给民工穿盖。并动员住地老乡腾房子烧水，一齐招待民工。全军在一夜之间救护了被难民工达八百五十七人，内有二十七个是重病的。很多民工感激得不知怎样才好，含着泪说：“你们的恩情我们无法报答，只有挖河当中再多卖力气！”事后，部队接到民工很多来信，纷纷表示要好好学习解放军热爱人民的互助精神，并要和部队一道坚决完成挖河任务！
    另一方面，解放军不仅是善于作战和劳动的军队，同时也是热爱文化的军队。表现在挖河中，就是文化娱乐与劳动紧密的结合。在河坡上，每一连都有一个“活动俱乐部”，那是用席子和土临时围成的小棚子。里面有墙报，有图书，有乐器，有黑板，有广播喇叭，和一切文化活动必要的用具。每一连也都有一个由战士自己组织的文化娱乐组，编演着自己连队的人物和故事。每当休息下来，立时在整个河工地段上锣鼓喧天，热闹起来。俱乐部的墙报、书报为大家翻阅着；黑板上的生字为大家阅读着；广播组的同志在用喇叭喊着各班的成绩和模范人物；说唱组的，就唱起了洋片和快板。有的就在土筐贴上两只眼睛，再披上一块毯子，屁股上扎个尾巴，就地耍起“狮子”来了。战士们不仅精神愉快，文化上也在进步着。某团二营机炮连长张清林，自挖河一个月来，学会二百六十个生字；该营六连连长周玉文也学会二百四十个生字。而某团几乎每一战士都写日记（识字班的写“识字日记”）。四连的墙报在一个礼拜日收到了一百四十六篇稿件，平时也能每天收到八十多篇。某团四连的墙报委员会，也曾在一天之内收到一百多首快板。只从这简单的数目来看，便可想到这挖河部队的文化活动是怎样的活跃而且广泛！有人把这里比作经常的“庙会”，可是有一个战士的“挖河乐”快板却说得更肯切些：“休息号响，放下锨筐；掏出钢笔，放好纸张；编话识字，日记经常；人民军队，模范学堂！”的确，人民解放军不论在战斗或生产中，都是有着高度组织性和纪律性的“模范学堂”。
    现在，战士们仍在这七里长的地段上，紧张愉快地劳动着。他们自四月六日开工以来，由每人每天平均一方二三土的纪录，已逐渐上升到三方和三方以上，全数六十多万方土的工程，完成数目已超过了一半。战士们正准备着拿出多大的突击力量，发起最后竞赛，争取在六月十号前胜利完工。加上数万民工的共同努力，一条象征冀东八县人民福利的崭新的宽阔河道，即将出现在这辽阔的渤海湾上，而连年危害八县人民生命财产的罪恶水灾，也将随着新河道的洪流，一起投入海里而一去不返。
