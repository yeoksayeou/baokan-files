Xinhua News Agency, June 28th:

　　Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai today issued a statement regarding Truman's statement on the 27th. The full text is as follows:

　　After instigating the South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet government to provoke the Korean civil war, US President Truman issued a statement on June 27th, announcing the US government's decision to use force to prevent the liberation of Taiwan. The US Seventh Fleet has also been dispatched to the waters off Taiwan under Truman's orders.

　　I now, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, declare: Truman's statement on the 27th and the actions of the US Navy constitute armed aggression against Chinese territory and a complete violation of the United Nations Charter. This act of violent plunder by the US government is not unexpected by the Chinese people, but only increases the Chinese people's indignation, because the Chinese people have long and continuously exposed the entire conspiracy plan of US imperialism to invade China and dominate Asia, and Truman's statement is merely a public exposure and implementation of its pre-determined plan. In fact, the US government's instigation of the Korean Syngman Rhee puppet army to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a pre-determined step by the United States, the purpose of which is to create excuses for the United States to invade Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines, and it is a further action of US imperialism to interfere in Asian affairs.

　　I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, declare: No matter what obstructive actions US imperialists take, the fact that Taiwan belongs to China can never be changed; this is not only a historical fact, but has also been affirmed by the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, and the status quo after Japan's surrender. Our entire people will surely unite as one and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan from the hands of US aggressors. The Chinese people, who defeated Japanese imperialism and the US imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek, will surely be able to victoriously expel the US aggressors and recover Taiwan and all territories belonging to China.

　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China calls on all peace-loving, just, and free people in the world, especially the oppressed nations and peoples of the East, to rise up together to stop the new aggression of US imperialism in the East. As long as we are not intimidated and resolutely mobilize the broad masses of the people to participate in the struggle against the warmongers, this aggression can be completely defeated. The Chinese people express their sympathy and respect for the Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Japanese people who are also suffering from US aggression and are also engaged in the struggle against it, and firmly believe that all the oppressed nations and peoples of the East will surely bury the heinous US imperialist warmongers in the flames of the great struggle for national independence.

### 周外长发表声明  杜鲁门声明和美海军行动是对我武装侵略  我全体人民必将从美侵略者手中解放台湾

　　周外长发表声明
    杜鲁门声明和美海军行动是对我武装侵略
    我全体人民必将从美侵略者手中解放台湾
    【新华社二十八日讯】中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长本日就杜鲁门二十七日声明发表声明，全文如下：
    美国总统杜鲁门在指使南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府挑起朝鲜内战之后，于六月二十七日发表声明，宣布美国政府决定以武力阻止我台湾的解放。美国第七舰队并已奉杜鲁门之命向台湾沿海出动。
    我现在代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府声明：杜鲁门二十七日的声明和美国海军的行动，乃是对于中国领土的武装侵略，对于联合国宪章的彻底破坏。美国政府这种暴力掠夺的行为，并未出乎中国人民的意料，只更增加了中国人民的愤慨，因为中国人民许久以来即不断地揭穿美国帝国主义侵略中国、霸占亚洲的全部阴谋计划，而杜鲁门这次声明不过将其预定计划公开暴露并付之实施而已。事实上，美国政府指使朝鲜李承晚傀儡军队对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的进攻，乃是美国的一个预定步骤，其目的是为美国侵略台湾、朝鲜、越南和菲律宾制造借口，也正是美帝国主义干涉亚洲事务的进一步行动。
    我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府宣布：不管美国帝国主义者采取任何阻挠行动，台湾属于中国的事实，永远不能改变；这不仅是历史的事实，且已为开罗宣言、波茨坦宣言及日本投降后的现状所肯定。我国全体人民，必将万众一心，为从美国侵略者手中解放台湾而奋斗到底。战胜了日本帝国主义和美国帝国主义走狗蒋介石的中国人民，必能胜利地驱逐美国侵略者，收复台湾和一切属于中国的领土。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府号召全世界一切爱好和平正义和自由的人类，尤其是东方各被压迫民族和人民，一致奋起，制止美国帝国主义在东方的新侵略。只要我们不受恫吓，坚决地动员广大人民参加反对战争制造者的斗争，这种侵略是完全可以击败的。中国人民对于同受美国侵略并同样进行反抗斗争的朝鲜、越南、菲律宾和日本人民表示同情和敬意，并坚信全东方被压迫民族和人民，必能把穷凶极恶的美国帝国主义的战争制造者，最后埋葬在伟大的民族独立斗争的怒火中。
