Red Scarf
    ——An Excellent Children's Play
    By Ke Jia
    Written by Soviet author Sergei Mikhalkov
    Translated by Ding Lihong · Published by Xinhua Bookstore

How do the outstanding young generation in the Soviet Union live? What role does the great organization "Young Pioneers" play in their lives? This outstanding work by the famous children's literature writer Sergei Mikhalkov answers these questions that we care about.

This play writes about the lives and thoughts of several Young Pioneers, especially focusing on Valery, the protagonist. He is a talented, intelligent child who excels in his studies and has strong discipline. However, his superior personal qualities have made him arrogant and impolite. As this continues to develop, he becomes stubborn and refuses to listen to others' advice, not only not serving everyone but also wanting everyone to serve him, becoming a somewhat selfish individualistic hero. He would rather draw landscapes out of personal interest, but refuses the task assigned by the team to draw a wall newspaper. As a result, he is stripped of his "red scarf" - a corner of the red flag, and expelled from the organization.

After losing this "red scarf," he experiences contradiction and pain, and even his temperament becomes so rough. When he loses it, he realizes its preciousness and resolves to win it back. At the same time, his best friend, Chashkin, breaks up with him; his father scolds him; and his sister advises him, satirizes him, and scolds him. When a person leaves the organization and separates from the masses, there are walls everywhere, and they find themselves in an embarrassing situation. This is the first significance revealed by this play.

In this play, our playwright not only writes about his characters, but also writes about a new environment of Soviet socialist society. This environment cultivates new Soviet people. If anyone violates the common goal of collectivism, then if they do not correct themselves, they will shatter themselves.

Valery made a mistake, which can be said to be a serious mistake, but this is not "bad," not a question of character; mistakes are inevitable for everyone. Once he corrects his mistake and removes the shortcomings from himself, he immediately becomes an excellent Young Pioneer. This has a different significance than the work "The Young Guard".

The Young Pioneers all know the glorious significance of this title and what they should do for it. They expect themselves to further become "Communist Youth League members" and "Party members," and they regard these as "three important events" in life. The play writes that they all love to read "The Young Guard"; it also writes about Valery's father—a Communist Party member from a working-class background—and Chashkin's father, who sacrificed himself on the battlefield to defend the motherland. For them—these Young Pioneers—aren't those Youth League members who sacrificed for the motherland, and the fathers who died for the safety of the motherland and devoted themselves to the construction cause of the motherland, vivid examples hanging before their eyes?

I think this play is not only of educational significance for Soviet children. It writes a total of eight characters, all of whom are prominent and have their own faces. The translation is also simple and vivid. This is a good book, and I hope that Chinese children and teenagers, in today's era of extreme spiritual famine, can draw some beneficial nourishment from it.

　　红领巾
    ——一本优秀的儿童剧
    克家
    苏联·米哈尔果夫著
    丁力红译·新华书店版
    苏联优秀的年轻的一代在怎样生活着？“少年先锋队”这个伟大组织对他们这一群起着怎样的作用？著名儿童文学作家米哈尔果夫的这本杰出的作品回答了我们所关怀着的这些问题。
    这个剧本写了几个少先队员的生活、思想动态，特别着力写了作为主角的华列里。他是有才能、聪明、功课优异、纪律性颇强的一个孩子。由于他个人条件的优越造成了他的骄傲、对人没礼貌，一直发展下去，便变成为刚愎倔强、不听信别人劝告，不但不替大家服务、反要大家为他服务的一个有点自私的个人英雄主义者了。他宁愿感兴地画画风景画，但拒绝了队上派他画壁报的工作。结果是他被摘下“红领巾”——红旗的一角，被组织开除了。
    丢掉了这条“红领巾”以后，他得到的是矛盾、痛苦，连性子也变得那么粗暴了。当一失去它的时候，他就知道了它的宝贵而决心争取回来。同时，他的最好的朋友查士金和他闹了分裂；他父亲在责备他；他妹妹在劝告他、讽刺他、骂他。一个人脱离了组织，离开了群众，便到处是墙壁，陷于难堪的境地。这是这个剧本所揭示的第一个意义。
    我们的剧作者在这本剧里，不只写出了他的人物，也写出了一个苏维埃社会主义社会的新环境。这个环境是培植新的苏维埃人的，谁要是违背了集体主义的共同目标，那，他不改正自己便要粉碎自己。
    华列里犯了错误，还可以说是严重的错误，但这却不是“坏”，不是品质的问题；错误是人人难免的，一旦他改正了错误，把缺点从身上去掉，他便即刻成为一个优秀的少先队员。这比“表”那本作品有了不同的意义。
    少先队员们都知道这个称号的光荣意义，自己应该为它做些什么。他们期许自己进一步成为“青年团员”、“党员”，他们把这些认为是人生的“三个重要事件”。剧本里写了他们都爱读《青年近卫军》；也写了华列里的父亲—一个苦工出身的共产党员，而查士金的父亲为了保卫祖国牺牲在疆场上。对于他们——这些少先队员，那些为祖国牺牲了的青年团员，还有为祖国的安全而死去、为祖国的建设事业而全力以赴的父亲们，不就是一幅幅悬在眼前的典范的写照吗？
    这个剧本我想不只对于苏联的少年富有教育意义。它一共写了八个人物，都很突出，各有自己的一幅面目。译文也很朴素传神。这是一本好书，愿意中国的儿童、少年们在精神食粮奇缺的今天，能从中吸取一些有益的滋养。
