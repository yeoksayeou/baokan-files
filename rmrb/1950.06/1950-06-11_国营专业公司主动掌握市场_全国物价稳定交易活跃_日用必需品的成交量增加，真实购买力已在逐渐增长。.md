　　State-owned Specialized Companies Take the Initiative to Control the Market
    National Prices are Stable, Transactions are Active
    The Transaction Volume of Daily Necessities Increases, Real Purchasing Power is Gradually Increasing.
    [Report from this newspaper] Since late May, national prices have tended to stabilize, and market transactions have gradually become active. Since the unification of financial and economic work in March, prices in various regions have successively fallen, and the magnitude has increased every ten days. Taking mid-March as the starting point for the decline, it fell by 4.3 percent compared with the first ten days of the month. It reached its peak in mid-April, and the average chain relative index of decline per ten days was 10.5 percent. In the following weeks, it gradually narrowed, and by mid-May, it had basically stopped the downward trend and tended to stabilize. As a result, it turned upward in late May, with an index increase of 1.1 percent compared with mid-May. If we look at the major administrative regions separately, comparing late May with mid-May, the Southwest region fell by 1.3 percent, the North China region rose by 0.3 percent, the Northwest region fell by 2.1 percent, the Central South region rose by 3.2 percent, and the East China region rose by 2.2 percent. Looking at the types of commodities, comparing late May with mid-May, except for a slight drop of 0.2 percent in grain, the rest generally tended to rise. Non-staple food was 103.1, cotton yarn and cloth was 102.3, fuel was 101.8, groceries were 100.6, and gold and silver were 101.2. This shows that various prices have reached a stable point.
    During the price decline in March and April, market commodities were generally unsalable, resulting in various unreasonable price phenomena. In order to adjust these unreasonable phenomena, the Central Trade Department instructed its affiliated specialized companies to actively control the market and conduct appropriate purchases and sales to facilitate price stability and market activity. Companies in various regions carried out various purchasing and sales work according to instructions. The Shanghai Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company adopted the method of purchasing when cotton yarn prices fell and selling when they rose, so that Shanghai cotton yarn remained stable at around 5.1 million yuan, thus playing a certain stabilizing role in the national yarn and cloth market. In the Xuzhou market, due to the purchase by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the market price of a bolt of cotton cloth had risen from 210,000 yuan to 240,000 yuan by the end of mid-May, making the market price close to the listed price. Since mid-May, various specialized companies in Shijiazhuang have also been continuously purchasing, so that the market price of grain and cloth is basically close to the listed price. After the Xi'an Trading Company purchased 929,000 jin of grain and 2,200 bolts of cloth, the city's prices stopped falling. Various specialized companies also guided currency to the countryside to purchase farmers' native products, in order to appropriately increase farmers' purchasing power and partially solve the sales of urban industrial products, which also played a significant role in stabilizing prices. The China Tea Company of East China Region began to purchase tea on May 5, and the purchase volume accounted for one-third of the total output of red and green tea in the entire East China Region; the Department Store Company of East China Region, while diverting currency to the countryside, promoted a large number of industrial products to the countryside. In April alone, it adjusted cotton textiles, stationery, soap and various daily-use department stores in various regions to reach 27.9 billion yuan, including 5.7 billion yuan worth of goods shipped to North China, 4.1 billion yuan to Central South, 4.2 billion yuan to Southwest, 1.9 billion yuan to Northwest, and 12 billion yuan to East China. A large number of department stores are still being transferred. The sales of industrial products are gradually expanding, and urban prices are gradually stabilizing. In addition, as sugar is a popular season, the sugar market transactions in various regions have suddenly become active, and prices have naturally tended to rise. The price of sugar in Tianjin rose from 360,000 yuan per package on May 19 to 450,000 yuan on May 21.邯郸 purchased 30 packages of sugar in Linqing on the 23rd and sold them out completely within one day. With the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands and the breaking of the Haikou blockade, import and export merchants have become increasingly active, and white oil prices have gradually risen. The national white oil price in late May has risen by an average of 3.1 percent compared with mid-May, with the largest increases in Hankou, Guangzhou, Jinan, Xuzhou, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang, reaching about 10 percent.
    What is especially important is that real purchasing power is gradually increasing. The grain, cloth, and other items purchased and stored by local agencies, factories, schools, citizens, etc., during the hyperinflation period before March, have been consumed in March and April, and need to be purchased in May. Therefore, the transaction volume of daily necessities such as grain and cloth has gradually increased. In late May, the total transaction volume of people's essential grains (including wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, millet, and other miscellaneous grains) in the three major cities of Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou increased compared with the first and middle ten days of May and each ten days in April. In late May, the total grain transaction volume in the three major cities was more than 27.62 million jin, an increase of more than 7.4 million jin compared with mid-May and more than 5.11 million jin compared with the first ten days of May. Specific situation: In Tianjin, public and private grain institutions traded more than 2.7 million jin of wheat in the market in late May, an increase of nearly 130,000 jin compared with the transaction volume in the first ten days of May. The transaction volume of corn also increased by more than 1.89 million jin compared with the first ten days of May, and more than 650,000 jin compared with the average transaction volume per ten days in April. The transaction of flour also increased by nearly 40,000 bags compared with the first ten days of May. The Beijing market is also in the same situation, such as the transaction volume of wheat in late May being more than 740,000 jin more than the first ten days of May, and more than 820,000 jin more than the average transaction volume per ten days in April. Flour has also increased slightly. Shanghai is a huge rice and flour consumption city. After prices stabilized, the market appeared sluggish, but since mid-May, the market has tended to be active. For example, the transaction volume of rice increased by more than 1.01 million jin compared with the first ten days of May, and flour also increased. The markets in other cities are also slightly active, and the transaction volume has increased. In addition, the transaction volume of yarn and cloth in major cities has also increased. For example, Beijing traded 49,612 bundles of yarn in May, an increase of 5,104 bundles compared with April and 28,072 bundles compared with March. The transaction of cloth in April increased by 17,053 bolts compared with March. Tianjin is also in the same situation, such as the transaction volume of yarn in May increasing by 894 pieces compared with April.
    After the market became more active in late May, the sales and transaction volume of private industrial and commercial enterprises still accounted for a larger proportion. In Tianjin, in terms of grain, flour accounted for 52.9 percent, wheat accounted for 23.3 percent, and rice accounted for 34.6 percent; in terms of cotton cloth, cotton accounted for 62.4 percent, and white cloth accounted for 79.7 percent. In Shanghai's grain transactions, rice is the main commodity, and private commerce accounts for 64.1 percent of the transaction volume; in Beijing, flour is the main commodity, and private commerce also accounts for 64.3 percent of the transaction volume, and the rest of wheat, millet, corn, etc. are more than 80 to 90 percent; especially in terms of cloth, white cloth accounts for 95.1 percent, and colored cloth accounts for 99.5 percent. It can be seen that the people's government maintains listed prices to stabilize the market, and after the people's real purchasing power increases, private industrial and commercial enterprises have broad development prospects.

　　国营专业公司主动掌握市场
    全国物价稳定交易活跃
    日用必需品的成交量增加，真实购买力已在逐渐增长。
    【本报讯】进入五月下旬以来，全国物价已趋稳定，市场交易亦已逐渐活跃。自三月份统一财经工作后，各地物价即相继下落，幅度亦逐旬加大。以三月中旬为下落起点，比上旬落百分之四点三，到四月中旬达到最高峰，逐旬下落的平均环比指数已为百分之十点五。其后数旬则已逐渐缩小，到五月中旬即基本上制止了下落的形势而趋向稳定，因而五月下旬转成上升，其指数比中旬升了百分之一点一。若按大行政区分别来看，五月下旬与中旬比较，西南区下落百分之一点三，华北区上升百分之零点三，西北区下落百分之二点一，中南区上升百分之三点二，华东区上升百分之二点二。再按商品种类来看，下旬与中旬比较，除粮食微落百分之零点二外，其余均趋上升，副食品是一○三·一，花纱布是一○二·三，燃料是一○一·八，杂货是一○○·六，金银是一○一·二。由此可见，各种物价已达稳定地步。
    在三、四月间物价下落的过程中，市场商品曾普遍滞销，因而产生了各种价格上不合理的现象。中央贸易部为调整这些不合理现象，曾指示所属各专业公司主动的掌握市场，适当地进行收购和出售，以利物价稳定、市场活跃。各地公司根据指示即进行了购销的各种工作。上海花纱布公司曾采取了在棉纱落价时进行收购、上涨时进行出售的办法，使上海棉纱始终稳定在五百一十万元上下，因而对全国纱布市场起到了一定的稳定作用。徐州市场，由于花纱布公司的收购，至五月中旬末一匹棉布已由市价二十一万提升到二十四万元，使市价与牌价接近一致。中旬以来，石家庄各专业公司也不断的收购，使粮布市价与牌价基本相接近。西安贸易公司收购九十二万九千斤粮食和二千二百匹布之后，使该市物价停止了下落。各专业公司又引导货币下乡，收购农民土产，以适当提高农民购买力，部分解决城市工业品的销路，对稳定物价也起了很大作用。华东区中国茶叶公司自五月五日开始收购茶叶，收购数量为全华东区全部红绿茶叶产量的三分之一；华东区百货公司在疏导货币下乡的同时，推动大批的工业品下乡，仅四月份，就调剂各区棉织品、文具、肥皂及各种日用百货达二百七十九亿元，计输往华北区总值五十七亿元，中南区四十一亿元，西南区四十二亿元，西北区十九亿元，华东区一百二十亿元，尚有大批百货正在调运中。使工业品的销路逐渐开拓，城市的物价逐渐稳定。加以食糖为畅销季节，故各地糖市交易顿形活跃，价格亦自然趋升。天津糖类即由五月十九日每包价格三十六万元升至二十一日的四十五万元。邯郸则于二十三日在临清购糖三十包，一天之内即完全售光。舟山群岛解放，海口封锁打破，进出口商即日趋活跃，白油价格逐步上升。全国白油价格，五月下旬已比中旬平均上升百分之三点一，而以汉口、广州、济南、徐州、保定、石家庄上升较多，达百分之十左右。
    尤其重要的是真实购买力已在逐渐增长。各地的机关、工厂、学校、市民等，在三月以前通货膨胀时所购存的粮布等物品，经过三、四月份的消费，至五月间已需要购进，因而日用必需物品如粮食、布匹等成交量已逐渐增加。五月下旬津、沪、汉三大城市人民必需的粮食（包括小麦、大米、玉米、高粱、小米及其他杂粮等）的总成交量，与五月上、中旬及四月间各旬比较，均有增加。五月下旬三大城市粮食总成交量是二千七百六十二万余斤，即较中旬增加七百四十万余斤，较上旬增加五百一十一万余斤。具体情况：在天津，五月下旬公私粮食机构在市场共成交小麦二百七十万余斤，比五月上旬成交量增加近十三万余斤。玉米的成交量亦比五月上旬多一百八十九万余斤，比四月份平均每旬成交量多六十五万余斤。面粉成交亦比五月上旬增加将近四万袋。北京市场亦有同样情形，如下旬小麦成交量比五月上旬多七十四万余斤，比四月份每旬平均成交量亦多八十二万余斤。面粉亦稍有增加。上海是一个巨大的米面消费城市，物价平稳后，市场呈现萧条，但至五月中旬以来，市面已趋向活跃。如大米成交量即比五月上旬多一百零一万余斤，面粉亦有增加。其他各城市的市场均略呈活跃，成交额均有增加。此外，各大城市纱布的成交量亦有增加。如北京市五月份成交纱四万九千六百一十二捆，比四月份增加五千一百零四捆，较三月份增加二万八千零七十二捆。布四月份较三月份成交增加一万七千零五十三匹。天津亦有同样情况，如五月份纱的成交量较四月份增加八百九十四件。
    五月下旬市场日趋活跃后，私营工商业的售出成交量仍占较大比重。天津市在粮食方面，面粉占百分之五二·九，小麦是百分之二十三·三，大米是百分之三四·六；棉布方面，棉花占百分之六二·四，白细布占百分之七九·七。上海粮食成交，大米为大宗，私营商业即占成交量的百分之六四·一；北京是面粉为多，私营商业亦占成交量的百分之六四·三，其余小麦、小米、玉米等更在百分之八十至九十以上；特别是布匹方面，白细布达百分之九五·一，花色布达九九·五。可见人民政府维持牌价使市场稳定，而在人民真实购买力增长后，私营工商业是有其宽广发展的前途的。
