Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 15th (TASS Comprehensive Dispatch): The Soviet Union's Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) issued a decision on June 15th regarding the harvesting of agricultural products and the delivery of grain to the state. The decision points out that the primary tasks at present are to take necessary measures to increase crop yields, accumulate sufficient fodder for animal husbandry, timely prepare collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations with the equipment needed for harvesting, smoothly conduct harvesting and storage of harvested crops, and implement the plans for delivering agricultural products.

The decision points out that the various agricultural machines and equipment prepared by collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations for harvesting this year are better than last year. Relevant departments have also ensured the timely supply of large quantities of agricultural machinery. The Central Cooperative Union has been ordered to timely supply collective farms with timber and various harvesting implements. Work such as repairing all machines, supplying fuel and lubricating oil, and preparing cranes and warehouses must be properly handled before the start of the harvest. All kinds of cranes must be ready for work before September 1st.

The decision made specific instructions regarding the organization of fodder production and preservation needed for animal husbandry, and the implementation of the harvesting and delivery of grain, sugar beets, cotton, and potatoes.

The decision emphasizes that all collective farms and state farms must organize timely harvesting and highly effectively utilize combines and other machines, and widely adopt grain selection harvesting methods, without waiting for the grain in large areas of fields to fully mature before harvesting. From the very first days of harvesting, it is necessary to ensure that every collective farm and state farm can participate in grain delivery work every day until they have completed the state-mandated grain delivery plan. The decision also stipulates that ensuring the necessary amount of high-quality seeds is one of the most important tasks of collective farms and state farms.

Pravda published an editorial on this, saying: The decision of the Soviet Union's Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is a concrete work program for Party and Soviet organizations, agriculture and food supply agencies, and a program for striving for new victories in socialist agriculture and livestock breeding, and for consolidating the collective farm system. This decision will surely be warmly welcomed by the agricultural laboring people throughout the country.

　　苏颁布农产品收获与缴纳决定
    真理报社论指出：这是争取社会主义农业的新胜利及巩固集体农场制度的斗争纲领
    【新华社十七日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：苏联部长会议和联共中央十五日发布关于进行农产品收割与向国家缴纳谷物的决定。决定指出，目前的首要任务，为采取必要措施，以提高农作物的收获量，为畜牧业累积数量充足的刍秣，为集体农场、国营农场与机器拖拉机站及时准备收获工作所需的设备，顺利地进行收获及贮藏收获物，和贯彻缴纳农产品的计划。
    决定指出，集体农场、国营农场与机器拖拉机站今年为收获工作而准备的各种农业机器与设备，比去年做得更好。各有关部会也保证了及时供应大量农业机器。中央合作社联合会已奉命及时以木材及各类收割器具供应给集体农场。关于修理一切机器，供应燃料、润滑油，准备起重机和仓库等工作，都必须在收获开始前办理妥当。各种起重机必须在九月一日前准备好工作。
    关于组织牧畜业需要的秣草制造和保藏的工作，及贯彻谷物、甜菜根、棉花及马铃薯等的收获和缴纳工作，决定中都作出了具体的指示。
    决定强调一切集体农场和国营农场必须组织及时的收割，和高度有效地利用联合机及其他机器，广泛采用谷物挑选收割法，而不必等待大片田地上的谷物全部成熟时再收割。从收割的最初几天起，就要确保每一集体农场和国营农场能每天参加谷物缴纳工作，直到它们完成了国家规定的谷物缴纳计划时为止。决定又规定：确保必要数量的上等种子是集体农场和国营农场的最重要的任务之一。
    真理报为此发表社论说：苏联部长会议和联共中央的这一决定，乃是党与苏维埃组织、农业和粮食供应机构的具体工作纲领，也是争取社会主义农业和牲畜饲养的新的胜利以及巩固集体农场制度的斗争纲领。这一决定必将受到全国农业劳动人民的热烈欢迎。
