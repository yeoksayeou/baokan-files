Jinan-Xuzhou Telecommunication Line to be Completed by the End of July
    The Jinan-Xuzhou line surveying project, one of the six major telecommunications projects in the country, was fully completed on the 13th of this month. It was completed 15 days ahead of the original plan, saving the country over 5.65 million yuan in expenses. Currently, the work of setting up poles and wires has begun on this line, and it is expected that the entire line will be completed by the end of July.
