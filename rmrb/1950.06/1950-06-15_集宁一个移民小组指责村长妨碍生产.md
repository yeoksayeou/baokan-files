　　A Jining Immigration Group Accuses Village Chief of Obstructing Production
    To the Editors:
    We are immigrants from Beijing who have come to Halahaigou Village, Jining. After arriving here, Village Chief Zhao Lian failed to resolve our difficulties, making production impossible. Therefore, we are writing this letter to report to you.
    We eight immigrant households were assigned to Halahaigou Village, Second District, Jining on March 26th. Each household received one room, and each person received six mu of land. We are now working hard to engage in production, but we have encountered difficulties in production, such as not being able to use draught cattle. Village Chief Zhao Lian of this village should be responsible for these difficulties. Please consider the following facts:
    (1) We paid the highest price to the village chief to purchase two cows on our behalf. One was old, thin, and on the verge of death, eating very little, moving slowly, and often lying on the ground; the other was also thin and weak, with crossed front legs and difficulty moving. We repeatedly requested a return or exchange, but the village chief said, "The head can be cut off, but the cow cannot be exchanged." This matter was reported to the District Office, and the district cadres all believed that the bad cows should be returned or exchanged. However, the District Chief's attitude was ambiguous, and he did not resolve the issue. If the cows die, we will be responsible. We responded to the government's call to come to the Northwest to improve production. However, with poor livestock, planting becomes difficult; if we cannot plant, we will have to go hungry. The loans the government has given us will also be difficult to repay in the future.
    (2) The millet we received from the village government contained a large amount of sand. It is estimated that every pound contains more than two taels of sand. At the same time, when we received seeds from the district government and handed them over to the village for storage, over ten jin were missing from the 2,300 jin of seeds. The scale used by the village government is too large.
    (3) Before the immigrants arrived, the villagers' meeting resolved to settle the immigrants in an empty house in the village (a tile-roofed house, large and spacious, capable of accommodating several households). However, the village chief actually gave his own earthen house to the immigrants to live in, and moved his own family into the tile-roofed house to live comfortably.
    (4) Under the guise of transferring cooking utensils for the immigrants, he kept the good-quality bellows, pots, water vats, and other utensils that he had mobilized for his own use, or exchanged the bad ones for distribution to the immigrants.
    The above four points are all facts. We hope the government will quickly help us solve this difficulty.

    Editor's Note: The local government should promptly help resolve the difficulties mentioned in the letter from immigrants Li Liankui and others. We hope the Jining County Government will quickly send someone to the village to investigate and deal with the matter, and educate the village chief to correct his mistakes.

### 集宁一个移民小组指责村长妨碍生产

　　集宁一个移民小组指责村长妨碍生产编辑同志：
    我们是从北京来到集宁哈拉沟村的移民。我们到达此地后，因为村长赵连不给解决困难，致使生产无法进行。因此特写此信报告你们。
    我们八户移民于三月二十六日被分配到集宁二区哈拉沟村。每户分到一间房，每人六亩地。现在我们正在努力搞生产，但在生产中碰到了困难，如耕牛不能使用等。这些困难，本村村长赵连是应该负责的。请你们看看下面的事实吧：
    （一）我们出最高价钱由村长给代购两头牛，一头老瘦垂毙，饮食很少，行动蹒跚，时常卧地不起；另一头亦瘦弱不堪，前腿交叉，行动困难。我们一再要求退换，村长竟说“头可断，而牛不能换。”此事曾反映至区公所，区干部均认为坏牛应当退换。惟区长态度模棱两可，不给解决。倘若牛死去，就得我们负责。我们响应政府号召来到西北，目的是要搞好生产。可是牲畜不良，种地就发生了困难；不能种地，我们就得挨饿。政府贷给我们的款、今后也将难于偿还。
    （二）我们从村政府领到的糜米内含有大量沙子。约计每斤就有沙子二两多。同时，我们从区政府领到种子交村保存时，二千三百斤种子亏秤十余斤。村政府所用的秤太大了。
    （三）移民未到前，村民大会议决，将移民安置于村内的一座空房内（瓦房，宽大，可容数户）。而村长竟将自己所住土房，分给移民住，自己一家，迁入瓦房安居。
    （四）借调剂移民炊事用具名义，他将所动员来的风箱、锅、水缸等项用具，捡品质良好者留以自用，或调换坏的发给移民。
    以上四点，都是事实。希望政府赶快帮助我们解决这一困难。
    移民小组长李连魁
    组员云晓天、赵兰芳、赵文元、张文元、沈子和、王济民、雷尘清
    编者按：移民李连魁等来信中所说的困难，当地政府应该及时帮助解决。望集宁县府速派专人前往该村调查处理，并教育该村村长，纠正他的错误。
