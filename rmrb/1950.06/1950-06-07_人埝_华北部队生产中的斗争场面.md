    Struggle Scene in Production by North China Troops

    On May 4th, the Seventh Squad had seven men taking turns watching the rice seedling plots. A northwest wind started blowing. The Third Platoon Leader specially instructed the Seventh Squad Leader, "Our seedling fields are surrounded by water, more than a foot deep below the surface, and the water is five or sixty miles wide towards the northwest. If the wind gets stronger, the water will wash over, and our seedling plots will be in danger. Pay special attention to the northern embankment."
    "Yes!" Seventh Squad Leader Zhang Youhua replied, and took shovels and picks with all seven members of the squad to the plots. He first walked along the northern embankment. The water outside the embankment was crashing against it. The water was almost half a foot high. If it rose another foot, there would be a breach in the low-lying areas. He said to everyone, "We worked in the water for more than half a month to build these seedling plots. We can't let the wind destroy them. More than ten thousand catties of rice seeds, that's a lot of capital!" As he spoke, he saw soldier Xiao Qiao'er squatting at the base of the embankment, huddling his cotton clothes tightly around his legs, and asked kindly:
    "Xiao Qiao'er, are you sick?"
    "No, I'm just terribly cold."
    "Are you only wearing a single pair of pants?"
    "Yes!"
    "Go back and put on some clothes. I'm wearing three pairs of pants and I'm still cold." After he left, Zhang Youhua said to everyone, "It's very cold today. In order to protect the seedling plots and not delay the transplanting, everyone has to endure some hardship. Didn't the instructor tell us long ago that we are the people's army, and production is the same as fighting, both are for the people, and equally glorious? If something happens today, we must display the courageous spirit of storming Taiyuan. Wherever there is a breach, we must block it. We cannot let the water destroy our seedling plots. Do you all have this confidence?"
    "Yes! We couldn't eat for three days and nights during the battle, and we still fought lying in the snow. We've been through all that, what's this?" Li Tieshuan shouted抢着.“Good!” Seventh Squad Leader then excitedly said, "Today, the northern embankment is especially important. Li Tieshuan, Wang Daguo, Zhu Shizai and I are responsible for the northern embankment. Xiao Qiao'er, when you come back, stay with us too. Now we will use hard mud to heighten the embankment, paying special attention to the low-lying areas. Zhao Liang and Wei Gen will be left to watch the seedling plots and chase away the wild ducks."
    "Squad Leader," Wei Gen said anxiously as soon as he heard that he was being asked to chase away the wild ducks, "Let me block the embankment! In case something happens, I'm much stronger than Zhu Shizai. He had a stomachache all day yesterday."
    "Oh! I forgot. Then switch with Zhu Shizai!"
    "Okay!" Wei Gen snatched Zhu Shizai's shovel and ran off. Zhu Shizai got anxious and shouted, "I'm not switching with you. My stomach is perfectly fine." He took off to chase him, but was stopped by the Seventh Squad Leader: "The task of chasing away the wild ducks is also important. There are only the two of you for such a large area of ​​hundreds of acres, and there are so many wild ducks."
    After the work was divided, everyone went their separate ways.
    In the afternoon, the wind grew stronger. The waves hit the embankment and splashed four or five feet high. The wind whipped it up, and it was like rain inside the embankment. The five who were blocking the embankment were soaked to the skin, and their cotton clothes felt like they were tied to their bodies. The wind was so strong that they could barely stand. The squad leader was patrolling the embankment, and he stumbled and fell into the water. Just as he got up, he discovered that half a chunk of embankment soil had been washed away. In waist-deep water, he ran and shouted: "Wang Daguo! Wang Daguo! Go back and report, the embankment is about to be breached... ."
    Wang Daguo had just left when Wei Gen saw a breach in the east: "This is bad, there's a breach!" He jumped up and ran. The squad leader Li Tieshuan and Xiao Qiao'er heard this and ran after him like a charge without saying a word. Wei Gen was the first to arrive, but the breach had already widened. He threw a few shovels of mud, but it was all washed away. He became anxious, threw down his shovel, and crawled horizontally onto the embankment opening, blocking the torrent. The other three frantically threw dirt on Wei Gen's body. Just as they had blocked it, another breach appeared on the west side. The squad leader saw that the opening was too big and shouted urgently: "Everyone crawl on the embankment!" The four men, one after another, crawled onto the breach. Their whole bodies were soaked in water, being battered by the storm and waves. The splashing water stung their eyes. They anxiously waited for reinforcements.
    Wang Daguo stumbled and ran into the village, just as dinner was being served. The company commander saw that he was covered in water, like a drowned rat, and knew that the embankment was in danger. He jumped up from the kang: "What's wrong?"
    "The embankment is about to be breached."
    "Everyone put down your rice bowls and hurry to the rescue." The company commander gave the order and was the first to run to the courtyard to grab a bundle of reed mats and rushed out. As soon as he left the village, he was blown over by the wind. He got up, picked up the mats, and ran on. He heard the shout of the Seventh Squad Leader: "Company Commander! Over here. Company Commander! Over here." But he couldn't see anyone. Following the sound, he saw that all four of them were crawling on the embankment. The water washed over them. He hurriedly got into the water to block it with the reed mats, but the wind and waves were too strong to hold it. The breach was getting bigger and bigger. The company commander ordered the first platoon to get into the water and stand in a line to block the water. The first people to arrive got into the water one after another, facing the embankment, standing shoulder to shoulder. In less than a minute, they formed a human embankment twenty meters long. The waves crashed against their backs, and the storm howled, making it hard to open their eyes. However, the fighting heroes were not intimidated by the wind and waves. Seventh Squad Leader Zhang Youhua, with his back against the wind and waves, held the newly blocked mud in his arms with both hands, preventing it from being washed away. Then came Li Tieshuan, Wei Gen... The "human embankment" started working like a machine. The people inside the embankment kept throwing mud up. The "human embankment" pressed the mud into the water. In less than an hour, the twenty-meter-wide breach was blocked. Then reed mats were blocked on the outside of the embankment, mats were placed on the top of the embankment, and wooden stakes were driven in on both sides to hold them together. The wind and waves roared helplessly outside the embankment.

    华北部队生产中的斗争场面
    马骥
    五月四日、七班有七个人轮值看秧池子。天上刮起了西北风。三排长特别嘱咐七班长说：“咱们的秧田被水包围着，低下水面一尺多深，越往西北水越深，有五六十里宽。风大了，水都刮来，咱们的秧池就危险，要特别注意北面的埝子。”
    “是！”七班长张有华答应着，带上锨镐和全班七个人到了池子里。他先顺北埝走了一趟，埝外的水哗哗地扑打着埝子。水快涨到半尺。再涨一尺，低处就会决口。他对大家说：“风要是再大了，埝子就危险。咱们在水里干了半个多月才修好的秧池子，可不能让风给破坏了。一万多斤稻种子，本钱也不少呢！”他说着看见战士萧巧儿缩着头蹲在埝根，把棉衣紧紧围着两腿，就亲切地问道：
    “萧巧儿，你病了吗？”
    “没有，就是冷的不行。”
    穿着一条单裤啦？”
    “噢！”
    “快回去穿衣服吧，我穿着三条单裤还冷哩。”等他走了张有华又和大伙说：“今天冷得很，我们为了保护秧池，不误插秧，大家要吃些苦。指导员不是早就和咱们说过么，咱们是人民的军队，生产和战斗一样，都是为了人民，一样的光荣。今天要是出了事，咱们要发挥太原登城的勇敢精神，那里决口，那里挡住它，不能让水冲坏了咱们的秧池。大伙有这信心吗？”
    “有！战斗中三天三夜吃不上饭，还爬在雪地上打仗，那些都经过了，这还算什么。”李铁栓大声地抢着说。“好！”七班长就接着兴奋地说：“今天北埝特别重要，我和李铁栓、王大国、朱石在四个人负责北埝，萧巧儿来了也和我们在一起。现在就用硬泥加高埝子，特别要注意低处。剩下赵亮、魏根两个看着秧池，撵野鸭子。”
    “班长，”魏根一听叫他撵野鸭子，急着说：“我来挡埝子吧！万一出了事，我比朱石在壮得多。他昨天肚子痛了一整天。”
    “呵！我倒忘了，那就换朱石在吧！”
    “好！”魏根劈手夺了朱石在的锨跑了。朱石在可急了，一边嚷着：“我可不和你换，肚子八辈子就好了。”撒腿就追，被七班长叫住：“撵野鸭子的任务也重要，百十来亩的这么一大片，只有你们两个人，野鸭子又是那么多。”
    这样分了工之后，大家就分头各干各的去了。
    下午，风越来越大。浪头碰到埝上溅起四、五尺高，被风扬起，埝里像下雨一样。五个挡埝的，全身都湿透了，棉衣像捆在身上似的。风刮的站不住脚。班长在埝上巡逻，一错脚，平身倒在水里。刚爬起来，发现埝土被冲刷去半块。在腰深的水里他连跑带喊：“王大国！王大国！快回去报告，埝子快被水冲开了……。”
    王大国刚走，魏根看见东边决了口：“不行，决口了！”跳起来就跑。班长李铁拴和萧巧儿一听，二话没问，冲锋一样，随后跟着跑去。魏根第一个跑到，口子已大了，扔了几锨泥，全被冲走了。他着了急，把锨一扔，横着爬在埝口上，一下子挡住了急流。他们三个没命的往魏根身上挡土，刚挡住，西边又决了口。班长看见口子太大，大声急喊：“一齐爬在埝上！”四个人，一个接一个，爬在决口上。全身泡在水里，让暴风巨浪冲击着，水花泼打得睁不开眼睛，焦急地等待着援兵。
    王大国一步一摊水地跑进村里，刚巧才开饭。连长见他混身是水，像一个水鸡子似的，知道埝子出了危险，纵身从炕上跳起来：“怎么啦？”
    “埝子快被冲开了。”
    “一齐放下饭碗，赶快抢险。”连长下了命令，就首先跑到院里抢起一捆苇苞，冲了出去。一出村他就被风吹得跌了一跤，爬起来抱上又跑。只听见七班长的喊声：“连长！这儿来。连长！这儿来。”却看不见一个人。顺着声音跑去，才看见他们四个都爬在埝上。水从他们身上漫了过去。他急忙下水挡上苇苞，但风大浪猛，挡不住。口子越来越大，连长叫一排下水站横队挡水。先到的人一个接一个都下了水，背水面埝，一个紧靠一个，不到一分钟，站成了一道二十多米长的人埝。浪，碰在人背上飞溅起来，暴风怒吼着越来越紧，打得人睁不开眼。但是，风浪吓不倒战斗的英雄。七班长张有华，背挡着风浪，两手把新挡上的泥土按在怀里，不让水冲走。接着是李铁拴、魏根……。“人埝”像一部机器一样的开动起来，埝里的人手不停地往上扔泥。“人埝”把泥按在水里，不到一个钟头，二十多米宽的决口挡住了。接着在埝外挡上苇苞，埝头盖上席子，两边打上木桩夹起来，风浪无可奈何地在埝外呼叫着。
