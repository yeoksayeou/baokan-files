　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 22nd: Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Minister Dr. Gregor answered the following questions from a reporter of Red Right News regarding the recently concluded Sino-Czech trade agreement:

　　(1) Question: What is the economic significance for Czechoslovakia in concluding a trade agreement with China?

　　Answer: The trade agreement concluded with the People's Republic of China is a very significant event for Czechoslovakia. Economic and trade ties with China will guarantee more raw materials for our industry and a larger market for our products. The result will certainly significantly improve the living standards of the Czech people.

　　This year, the agreement will guarantee us significant deliveries of important goods, especially industrial raw materials that we have thus far been importing from capitalist countries. The largest item imported into our country this year is vegetable oil raw materials, which, combined with the raw materials imported from the Soviet Union and other People's Democracies, will be sufficient to supply our entire artificial oil and fat production.

　　Other goods imported from China include leather, tungsten, lead, mercury, mica, asbestos, hemp, silk, pig bristles, rosin and feed, tea, eggs, and other animal products. The main goods that Czechoslovakia exports to China are heavy industrial machinery and cast iron products, which will surely benefit China's industrial construction. Goods exported to China also include locomotives, trucks, leather shoes, rubber, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.

　　(2) Question: When will the first deliveries be made under the new agreement?

　　Answer: Both governments are striving to ensure the earliest possible mutual deliveries. The work of delivering goods was already underway during the negotiation of the trade agreement. In the recent few days, the first cargo ship carrying Czech goods to China will leave a Polish port, and a Chinese cargo ship loaded with goods for the Czech Republic is also preparing to depart. Sea transport takes about two and a half months, but it is expected that by the end of this year, the exchange of goods will have developed perfectly.

　　(3) Question: What is the importance of establishing trade relations with China for Czechoslovakia's socialist construction?

　　Answer: We have proven in our daily lives that Czechoslovakia's socialist construction can only be fully guaranteed by ensuring the independence of the Czechoslovak economy from capitalist countries. In view of the constant and comprehensive assistance given to us by the Soviet Union, and the precedent of our planned development of economic cooperation with the People's Democracies of Europe, the establishment of trade relations with the People's Republic of China will be another important step towards strengthening this independence.

　　We are well aware that the export of our industrial products to China will contribute to the construction and development of the Chinese economy. The Chinese economy is one of the important links upon which the strength of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union is based. Therefore, the establishment of Sino-Czech trade relations should be considered a major contribution to defending world peace.

　　捷对外贸易部长谈中捷贸易协定
    【新华社布拉格二十二日电】捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易部长格里高尔博士，向红色权利报记者解答最近缔结的中捷贸易协定签订的问题如下：
    （一）问：与中国缔结贸易协定，对捷克斯洛伐克经济上有什么意义？
    答：与中华人民共和国缔结的贸易协定，对捷克斯洛伐克说是非常重大的事件。与中国的经济和贸易的联系，将保证我国工业的更多的原料，及其产品的更大的市场，其结果必将显著提高捷国人民的生活水平。
    在今年，协定将保证我们得到重要的大量的交货，特别是那些我们至今还是由资本主义国家输入的工业原料。今年对我国输入的最大的一项是植物油原料，加上由苏联和其他人民民主国家所输入的这项原料，将足以供给我们整个人造油脂的生产。
    由中国输入的其他物品，包括皮革、钨、铅、水银、云母、石绵、麻、丝、猪鬃、松脂和饲料、茶叶、蛋品及其他动物产品等。捷克斯洛伐克输往中国的主要货物是重工业机器及铸铁业产品，这些货物必然将对中国的工业建设有所裨益。输往中国的货物还包括有机车、卡车、皮鞋、橡皮、化学品、医药品等。
    （二）问：根据新协定，第一次交货将在何时进行？
    答：两国政府皆力图保证相互交货的最早可能。早在谈判商约之时，即已进行了交货工作，在最近数天内，装运捷国输华货物的第一艘货船将驶离波兰港口，中国亦有一艘装运来捷货物的货船准备启碇。海上运输需时约两个半月，但预期到今年年底，换货工作将有完美的发展。
    （三）问：与中国建立贸易关系，对捷克斯洛伐克建设社会主义的重要性何在？
    答：我们已在日常生活中得到事实的证明：即只有确保捷克斯洛伐克经济脱离资本主义国家而独立，才能使我国建设社会主义得到充分的保证。鉴于苏联给我们的经常而全面的援助，以及我国与欧洲人民民主国家共同有计划地发展经济合作的先例，与中华人民共和国建立贸易关系，将成为走向加强此种独立的另一重要步骤。
    我们深知我国工业品的输往中国，将有助于中国经济的建设与发展。中国经济是苏联领导的和平阵营的力量所依据的重要环节之一。因此，中捷两国贸易关系的确立，应认为是对保卫世界和平的一个重大贡献。
