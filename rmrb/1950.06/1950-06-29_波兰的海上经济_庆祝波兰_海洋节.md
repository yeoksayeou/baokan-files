　　Poland's Maritime Economy
    ——Celebrating Poland's "Maritime Day"
    Today, June 29th, is Poland's "Maritime Day." Every year on this day, the Polish people joyfully celebrate their achievements in coastal construction and the development of their maritime economy.

    Poland's current coastline stretches for 497 kilometers, accounting for 14 percent of its total border length. When the new Poland was born in 1945, the coastline resembled a graveyard. Poland quickly restarted its coastal construction on these ruins.

    In mid-1945, the ports of Gdynia (1,400 hectares of sea surface, 14 meters deep) and Gdansk (4,800 hectares of sea surface, 11 meters deep) began to resume operations. In 1946, in Szczecin (1,326 hectares of sea surface), 393 hectares of port area with a depth of 6 to 10 meters were operational. In 1947 and early 1948, smaller ports such as Ustka, Darłowo, Kołobrzeg, Świnoujście, Elbląg, Kamień, and Łeba also began to receive ships.

    In 1948, the shipping volume of Polish ports already exceeded pre-war levels. (Note: Before the war, Gdynia, Gdansk, and Szczecin handled 25 million tons of cargo annually.) In 1949, the cargo volume of these ports doubled compared to 1946 and surpassed the highest pre-war levels. In 1949 alone, the customs duties collected from cargo handling in Szczecin port were six times higher than in 1946.

    The port investment plan was completed ahead of schedule in 1949. Polish ports have sufficient dockside cranes and warehouses to meet the maximum cargo volume anticipated for this year. These ports are developing further along with the development of Poland's maritime trade.

    In addition, Poland has begun to develop large-scale shipbuilding production. By the end of the three-year plan from 1947 to 1949, the tonnage of ships was 50 percent greater than before the war and is rapidly increasing further.

    Poland's regular transportation routes are also rapidly developing. Polish ships regularly sail to Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Canada, countries in the Near East, South America, and other countries. The development of the Polish merchant fleet is primarily based on Poland's own shipbuilding industry. By 1955, Poland will have seventy-four new ocean-going vessels launched. These ships, including their heaviest and most complex parts and machinery, are all made in Poland.

    The Polish merchant fleet is developing very rapidly by implementing planned economy, socialist labor methods, and thrift. It pays great attention to educating new workers and cadres, and ensuring the full welfare of every worker. Poland has many specialized schools to train new cadres. For example, the Higher School of Maritime Trade in Gdynia and the shipbuilding department of the Technical College in Gdansk. There are also many vocational schools and courses established to improve the professional knowledge of workers and sailors.

### 波兰的海上经济——庆祝波兰“海洋节”

　　波兰的海上经济
    ——庆祝波兰“海洋节”
    今天，六月二十九日，是波兰的“海洋节”。波兰人民每年在这一天都欢欣庆祝他们海岸建设的成绩与海上经济的发展。
    波兰目前的海疆长达四百九十七公里，为其疆界全长的百分之十四。一九四五年新波兰诞生的时候，海岸像一片坟场。波兰就在这废墟上很快地重新开始了她的海岸建设。
    一九四五年中，金尼亚港（海面一四○○海克脱，水深一四公尺）与甘斯克港（海面四八○○海克脱，水深一一公尺）开始恢复使用。一九四六年斯泽辛港（海面一三二六海克脱）有三九三海克脱海面，水深六至十公尺的港面在工作。一九四七年及一九四八年初，较小的港口如乌斯卡、达洛渥、柯洛布热格、斯温脑意赛、厄尔布拉格、卡敏及勒巴都开始进出船舰。
    一九四八年，波兰港口的船运已大于战前。（按：战前金尼亚、甘斯克与斯泽辛每年载货二千五百万吨。）一九四九年，那些港口的载货量两倍于一九四六年，并超过了战前的最高水平。一九四九年仅在斯泽辛港的载货所征关税就六倍于一九四六年。
    港口投资计划已在一九四九年提前完成。波兰港口有足够的码头起重机及仓库以满足今年可以预知的最大载货量。这些港口正随着波兰海上贸易的发展，进一步发展中。
    此外，波兰已开始发展大规模的海船生产。一九四七年至一九四九年的三年计划结束时，船只的吨位较战前大百分之五十，井在迅速地更加增大中。
    波兰正规的交通线也在迅速向前发展。波兰船只经常航行瑞典、丹麦、挪威、芬兰、英国、法国、美国、加拿大、近东诸国、南美及其他国家。波兰商船队的发展主要是以波兰本国造船业作基础的。至一九五五年，波兰将有七十四艘新的海洋船只下水。这些船只，包括其最重的与最复杂的零件和机器都是在波兰制造的。
    波兰商船队实行计划经济、社会主义劳动方法与节约，发展得非常迅速。她很注意教育新工人、新干部，并保证每个工人的充分福利。波兰有许多专门学校培养新干部。例如，金尼亚的海上贸易高等学校及甘斯克的技术专门学校造船系等。也有许多为提高工人及海员们业务知识而设立的职业学校与课程。
