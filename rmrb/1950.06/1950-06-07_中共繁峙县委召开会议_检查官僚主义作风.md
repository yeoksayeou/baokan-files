The CCP Fanshi County Committee Convenes Meeting
    Inspects Bureaucratic Work Style
    [This Dispatch] According to the Shanxi Daily: The CCP Fanshi County Committee, at its expanded county committee meeting held in mid-May, exposed the serious bureaucratic work style of the county and district leadership, and identified the root cause as complacency. Comrade Zhi Yintang, member of the Xinxian Prefectural Committee, also participated in and guided the meeting. The bureaucratic work style of the county and district leadership was first manifested in dealing with the issue of production and disaster relief. The second and sixth districts of the county suffered severe disasters last year, which the county committee was aware of. However, when the disaster situation had developed to a considerable extent this year in February and one victim had already starved to death, the county committee was unaware of this serious situation. Comrade Shi Youliang, dispatched by the Commissioner's Office, personally went to inspect and suggested that county-level leaders immediately send people to organize production and disaster relief. However, the county committee still did not pay attention and did not send anyone. It was not until Deputy Commissioner Zhi personally went to inspect in March that he aroused the attention of the county committee. However, individual leading comrades of the county government still emphasized that they were too busy to send cadres down to strengthen leadership. The county supply and marketing cooperative, due to its purely profit-seeking viewpoint, was indifferent to the suffering of the masses. Deputy Commissioner Zhi instructed the cooperative to use 20,000 catties of coarse grains to exchange for local products of the disaster-stricken masses to organize the victims to engage in sideline production. However, the leading cadres of the cooperative repeatedly defied this. They made excuses for lack of funds to higher authorities, but in fact stored 30,000 catties of rice in private merchant shops. Secondly, the bureaucratic work style was also manifested in the failure to conscientiously implement policies such as determining land ownership and rational burden; some county and district cadres harbored hedonistic and corrupt ideas; before the meeting, county and district leaders were still numb and blindly believed that Fanshi was an old area with a good work foundation and high mass enthusiasm for production, thus forming a long-term state of not understanding the situation and letting things drift, leading to a state of no leadership in spring production. After strict criticism and self-criticism at the meeting, in addition to publicly reviewing and admitting mistakes, the county committee decided to eliminate the bureaucratic work style in leadership, combine with summer production, conduct criticism and self-criticism among party members and cadres, and resolutely struggle against these bad ideological work styles. After the meeting, the county committee immediately led work teams to the countryside to carry out the work of implementing this resolution.

### 中共繁峙县委召开会议  检查官僚主义作风

　　中共繁峙县委召开会议
    检查官僚主义作风
    【本报讯】据山西日报讯：中共繁峙县委在五月中旬召开的县委扩大会议上，揭发了县、区领导上的严重的官僚主义作风，并检查出其根源主要是自满思想。会议并有忻县地委委员郅荫堂同志参加指导。该县县、区领导上的官僚主义作风，首先表现在对待生产救灾问题上。该县二、六区去年受灾严重，县委也知道。但当今年二月灾情已发展到相当严重程度并已有一个灾民饿死时，县委却并不了解这一严重情况。专署曾派石友良同志亲去检查，建议县级领导立即派人前去组织生产救灾。但县委仍未重视，也没派人。直至三月份，郅副专员亲去检查，才引起县委的重视。而县府却仍有个别领导同志强调工作忙，未能抽调干部下去加强领导。县供销社由于存在单纯营利观点，对群众疾苦漠不关心。郅副专员曾指示该社将两万斤粗粮去换购灾区群众的土产品，组织灾民进行副业生产。而该社领导干部却一再违抗。向上借口没有资金，实则是在私人商号却存米三万斤。其次，官僚主义作风还表现在：对确定地权、合理负担等政策未认真贯彻执行；部分县、区干部存在着享乐腐化思想；在会议之前，县、区领导仍麻木不仁，盲目的认为繁峙是老区，工作有基础，群众生产情绪高，因而形成长期的不了解下情而放任自流，致今春生产陷于无领导的状态。经过会议的严格批评与自我批评后，县委除公开检讨承认错误外，决定要肃清领导上的官僚主义作风，结合夏季生产，在党员、干部中进行批评与自我批评，向这些不良的思想作风作坚决的斗争。会后，县委即带领工作队下乡，进行贯彻这一决议的工作。
