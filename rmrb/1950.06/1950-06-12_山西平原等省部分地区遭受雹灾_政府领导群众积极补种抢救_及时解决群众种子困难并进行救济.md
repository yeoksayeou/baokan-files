Reports from correspondents: On May 25th, parts of Shanxi, Pingyuan, Henan and other provinces suffered severe hail disasters. At present, the people's governments and the CCP committees of the affected areas have taken emergency measures, dispatched cadres to the disaster areas to express their condolences, and organized the masses to quickly replant and change crops to carry out post-disaster work and overcome the disaster.

Since April, some villages in 37 counties in Shanxi Province have suffered hail disasters successively, with the one on May 25th being the most serious and widespread (a total of 20 counties). The large hailstones were the size of bowls, and the smaller ones were the size of eggs or walnuts. In total, about 1.3 million mu of wheat fields and autumn seedlings in Shanxi were damaged, of which more than 500,000 mu of wheat fields had no hope of harvest. In this hail disaster, 10 people were killed and 291 were injured; 12 livestock were killed and 11 were injured; 294 sheep were killed or injured; and 333 houses were destroyed. Xinxiang and Anyang Prefectures of Pingyuan Province, as well as 39 districts in 12 counties including Xinxiang, Yuanyang, Anyang, and Linxian, also experienced hail on the afternoon of May 25th, with hailstone sizes similar to those in Shanxi. According to preliminary statistics from the Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, the total area of ​​land affected by the disaster in the prefecture reached 1,677,305 mu, and in the most severely affected areas (about one-third of the region), wheat production will be reduced by 70%, and cotton seedlings were more than 90% damaged. Zheng County, Luoning, Song County, Shan County, Zhongmu and other places in Henan Province, and 20 villages including Suobao and Chian in She County of Handan Prefecture in Hebei also suffered from hail on May 25th.

After the hail disaster occurred, the party and government leading organs at all levels in the disaster areas immediately carried out emergency post-disaster arrangements. At the tenth administrative meeting on May 30th, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government decided to urgently mobilize the masses to overcome the disaster, calling on governments at all levels to actively organize the masses to carry out rescue work, and dispatch a large number of cadres to the disaster areas to stabilize the people's emotions, lead the masses to replant and change crops, and stop the development of the disaster. The government was to solve the seed difficulties in changing and replanting crops in a timely manner, organizing the masses to borrow and exchange seeds with each other; for those who were unable to solve the problem or could not completely solve it, local banks quickly issued seed loans, and for those who were unable to bear the loans and the masses who were living in extreme difficulty, relief was provided to help them overcome the famine and continue production. For those whose wheat fields were affected by the disaster, the burden of the wheat tax was reduced or exempted as appropriate. At the same time, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government also sent provincial government members Yang Zixiu and Zhi Yinglin, provincial government counselors Li Peiying, Zhang Deyuan, Li Tongsheng, and An Gongyi, deputy director of the Agricultural Department Zhang Tao, and deputy director of the Department of Culture and Education Cui Douchun to Changzhi, Yuncheng, Xinxian, Fenyang, Linfen and other prefectures to express their condolences to the victims; The Shanxi Provincial Consultative Committee also sent members Feng Yusong, Zhang Jichen, and Wang Jiaju to Yuncheng and Xinxian Prefectures to express their condolences, so as to stabilize the people's emotions and promote replanting work. Changzhi Prefecture (ten counties and thirty-seven districts were affected by the disaster), where the hail disaster was relatively severe in the province, issued an emergency instruction on the day after the hail disaster (26th), pointing out that overcoming the hail disaster in the disaster-stricken areas was the overriding task at present. Governments at all levels must organize all possible forces to go deep into the disaster areas, mobilize the masses, overcome the disaster, and point out the specific methods for rescue and replanting.

After learning that Xinxiang, Yuanyang, Anyang and other twelve counties had been hit by the disaster on May 27th, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government immediately convened an emergency meeting at 4:30 pm on the same day and adopted three emergency measures. Then, on May 30th, it issued five specific emergency instructions for rescuing disasters, ordering governments at all levels in the disaster areas to carefully study and arrange, and quickly implement them. Vice Chairman of the Provincial Government Jia Xinzhai and a group of eight people went to the Xinxiang disaster area to inspect and guide the rescue work. At present, all the disaster-stricken prefectures and counties in Shanxi, Pingyuan, Hebei, and Henan provinces are vigorously launching the work of overcoming the hail disaster under the leadership and assistance of Communist Party and People's Government cadres at all levels.

In this struggle against the hail disaster, the second and third districts of Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, under the leadership of the CCP County Committee and District Committee, based on past experience in fighting hail disasters, made preparations for hail prevention in advance. Each village established a hail prevention headquarters, set up an observation team for celestial phenomena and a hail prevention platform, and set up iron cannons, elm cannons, etc. This time, when hail clouds were first discovered, artillery fire was organized to shoot into the air, and finally the hail clouds were dispersed, turning hail into rain. Therefore, the losses in this hail disaster were relatively small. According to statistics from the Second District of Wuxiang alone, more than 60,000 mu of wheat fields and autumn seedlings were protected from losses. This method can be used for research and promotion in various places.

　　山西平原等省部分地区遭受雹灾
    政府领导群众积极补种抢救   
    及时解决群众种子困难并进行救济
    【本报讯】综合各地通讯员报道：五月二十五日，山西、平原、河南等地部分地区遭受严重雹灾。现各受灾地区人民政府及中共党委，已作紧急措施，调派干部分赴灾区慰问，并组织群众迅速补种、改种，进行善后工作，战胜灾害。
    山西省自四月以来，三十七县部分村庄曾先后发生雹灾，以五月二十五日的一次为害最重，面积最广（共二十个县）。冰雹大者如碗，次者如鸡蛋、核桃。总计山西受害麦田、秋苗约一百三十多万亩，其中有五十多万亩麦田收成无望。在这次雹灾中，并打死十人，伤二百九十一人；打死牲口十二头，伤十一头；死伤羊二百九十四只；被毁房屋三百三十三间。平原省新乡、安阳两专区、新乡、原阳、安阳、林县等十二县三十九个区亦于五月二十五日下午先后降雹，雹粒大小有如山西。据新乡专署初步统计，全专区被灾土地达一百六十七万七千三百零五亩，灾情严重者（约三分之一地区），小麦将减收百分之七十，棉苗损毁在百分之九十以上。河南省郑县、洛宁、嵩县、陕县、中牟等地，河北邯郸专区之涉县索堡、赤岸等二十村，五月二十五日亦有冰雹为害。
    雹灾发生后，受灾区各级党政领导机关即迅速进行紧急善后布置。山西省人民政府于五月三十日第十次行政会议上，决定紧急动员群众战胜灾害，号召各级政府积极组织群众进行抢救，抽调大批干部，赶赴灾区，以安定群众情绪，领导群众进行补种、改种，停止灾情发展。及时解决群众改种补种中的种子困难，组织群众互借互换；无力解决或不能完全解决的，由当地银行迅速发放种子贷款，无力承贷者及生活十分困难的群众，则进行救济，扶助其度过灾荒，继续生产。对麦田受灾者，则酌情减免麦征负担。同时，该省人民政府并派省府委员杨自秀、支应遴，省府参议李佩膺、张德源、李同升、安恭已，农业厅副厅长张涛、文教厅副厅长崔斗辰等分赴长治、运城、忻县、汾阳、临汾等专区慰问灾民；山西省协商委员会也派冯玉松、张吉辰、王家驹等委员赴运城及忻县专区作慰问工作，以安定群众情绪，推动抢补工作。该省雹灾较重的长治专区（十县三十七个区被灾），于雹灾翌日（二十六）即发出紧急指示，指出受灾地区，战胜雹灾为当前压倒一切的突击任务，各级政府要组织一切可能的力量，深入灾区，发动群众，战胜灾害，指出了抢救补种的具体办法。
    平原省人民政府，于五月二十七得悉新乡、原阳、安阳等十二县遭灾后，即于当日下午四时半召开了紧急会议，通过三项紧急措施。接着又于五月三十日发出五项具体抢救灾害的紧急指示，令受灾区各级政府慎重研究布置，迅速执行。省府贾心斋副主席等一行八人，并亲赴新乡灾区视察，指导抢救工作。现山西、平原、河北、河南等省各被灾专、县，在共产党和人民政府各级干部领导与帮助下，大力展开了战胜雹灾的工作。
    在这次向雹灾斗争中，山西武乡县二、三两区，在中共县委、区委的领导下，根据过去与雹灾斗争的经验，事先做好防雹准备，各村成立了防雹指挥部，设立观察天象组和防雹台，按设铁炮、榆木炮等，这次开始发现雹云时，即组织炮火对空射击，终将雹云打散，化雹为雨。因此在这次雹灾中受损失较小，仅据武乡二区统计，即保护了六万多亩麦田和秋苗未受损失。此一方法，可供各地研究与推广。（李明、李云、梦笔、高明远、张超、史标唐、刘志鹏、刘观臣、刘耀光、郝文龙、李兴华、赵景祥、李秋轩、孟厚、张道清、吴培仁、孟韬、树春、塞风、青平、席兴福、朝谷、亢戈、王庭栋、赵作为、余字、焦存福、杨珠宝）
