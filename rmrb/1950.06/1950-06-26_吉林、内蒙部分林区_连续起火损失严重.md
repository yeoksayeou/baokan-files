(Reported by the News and Communications Group of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation) Since early April, continuous mountain fires have occurred in many forest areas of Jilin and Inner Mongolia, resulting in significant losses. Local leading authorities are thoroughly investigating the causes of the fires. In Jiaohe, Dunhua, Yongji, Wangqing, Yanji, Hunchun, Antu, Helong and other places in Jilin Province, incomplete statistics from mid-April to early May show 325 mountain fires, burning 200,490+ hectares of barren mountains and forest land. In Jiaohe alone, 300,000 trees were destroyed. In the four forest areas of Arxan, Zhalantun, Yakeshi, and Bayan in Inner Mongolia, mountain fires also occurred successively on April 9th and 10th, with the Arxan forest area being the most severely affected. The two major fires destroyed a total of 100 square *li* of forest. An average of 1,000 small trees under ten years old per square *li* were burned, with an estimated 100,000 trees destroyed. Other damages included houses, vehicles, and telephone poles. In addition to fire fighting expenses, the total loss amounted to 2,530 million Mongolian currency units. The causes of the fires in the above-mentioned two places, except for Inner Mongolia where the cause is still under investigation, are as follows: in Jilin, some people burned wasteland (i.e., setting fires when reclaiming land), people engaged in sideline occupations in the forest areas were careless, sparks from railway locomotives, and sabotage by lurking counter-revolutionaries. Strict investigation and handling are currently underway.

The reason why the major fires could be extinguished early was mainly due to the timely mobilization of the masses by local leading organs to fight the fires, in addition to the sudden heavy rain caused by climate change. For example, when mountain fires broke out in Jilin Province, Vice Chairman of the People's Government and Director of Public Security Department Yu Ke, Vice Chairman and Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry Xu Yuanquan, and Deputy Director Liu Peng personally led more than 200 cadres from the level of division chief and forestry bureau director, along with a company of guards, to coordinate with Commissioner Zhu of the Yanbian Special District and county magistrates of various counties to mobilize and organize more than 20,000 people to rush to the fire scene to fight the fire. By May 3, all the fires were extinguished, and dense forest areas (such as Mihunzheng and Dahuangou in Antu County, Lishugou in Yanji County, and Xiaobao Forest Area in Wangqing County) were preserved.

　　吉林、内蒙部分林区
    连续起火损失严重
    【本报讯】据林垦部新闻通讯组报导：四月上旬以来，吉林、内蒙不少林区连续发生山火，损失甚重，当地领导机关对失火原因正在彻底查究中。吉林省蛟河、敦化、永吉、汪清、延吉、珲春、安图、和龙等地，从四月中旬到五月初的不完全统计，发生山火三百二十五次，燃烧荒山、林地二十万零四千九百多垧，烧毁的树木仅蛟河一地即达三十万株。内蒙境内阿尔山、扎兰屯、牙克石、巴彦四个林区，亦在四月九日和十日先后发生山火，尤以阿尔山林区为重。两次大火共烧毁森林一百平方华里，每方里十年生以下小树平均以一千株计，被焚树木当在十万株左右。其他受损害的还有住宅、车辆、电杆等，再加上灭火费用，共损失蒙币二十五亿三千多万元。上述两地起火原因，除内蒙尚未查明外，吉林各地是由于部分群众放荒（即开荒时放火）、在林区搞副业的人不慎失火、铁道机车喷火，以及潜伏的反革命分子放火破坏等等所造成，现正严密追查与处理中。
    这次大火所以能够及早扑灭，除因气候变化，骤下大雨外，主要是由于各地领导机关及时动员群众扑救。如吉林省人民政府副主席兼公安厅长于克、副主席兼农林厅长徐元泉、副厅长刘鹏等，在山火四起，情况紧急的时候，亲率处长、林务局长以下干部两百多人，警卫团一个连，协同延边专署朱专员和各县县长，分头动员组织群众两万多人，赶赴火场，努力扑救，到五月三日即全部扑灭，使茂密林区（如安图县之迷魂阵、大荒沟，延吉县之梨树沟，以及汪清县的小保林区）得以保全。
