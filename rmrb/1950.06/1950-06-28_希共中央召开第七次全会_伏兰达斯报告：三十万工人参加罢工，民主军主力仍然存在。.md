　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 23rd: Free Greece Radio broadcast: The Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party held its seventh plenary session from May 14th to 18th. Vlandas, member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, reported at the meeting that developments in the seven months since the Sixth Plenary Session of the CCP have demonstrated the correctness of the resolutions made at the Sixth Plenary Session. Currently, approximately 300,000 workers are involved in the strike movement. Guerrilla activities continue to serve as a warning to the enemies of the people; the main force of the Democratic Army still exists. The Royalist Fascists have failed even in their attempts to slightly alleviate the domestic crisis.

　　Vlandas then discussed the decline of the Greek economy, stating that Greece's industrial output in February this year was only 78.5% of the 1938 level. In February, the output of the metallurgical industry was only 12% of pre-war levels, the machine manufacturing industry only 55%, and the chemical industry only 65%. Greece's agricultural production is also only 63.1% of pre-war levels. This is the result of American rule.

　　Vlandas also reviewed the results of American "aid" to Greece and its financing of the Greek civil war, stating that the total loss of Greek materials amounted to $614,900,000; agricultural losses totaled $261,100,000; from 1946 to 1949, the official death toll was 150,000, but the actual number is far greater. As a result of "aid," the Greek people are now eating less than half the food they ate before the war, and Greece has become a representative country of Western-style democracy. According to official figures from the Royalist Fascists, from July 1947 to October 1949, 5,322 people were sentenced to death, of whom 3,033 were executed. Another 16,738 people were sentenced to long-term imprisonment, and 3,425 people were imprisoned awaiting trial.

　　In his report, Vlandas mentioned the growing strike movement in Greece and emphasized that the struggle to abolish the Makronisos concentration camps and to strive for amnesty has gained international support.

　　The second part of Vlandas's report discussed various issues within the Party.

　　希共中央召开第七次全会
    伏兰达斯报告：三十万工人参加罢工，民主军主力仍然存在。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社布拉格二十三日讯：自由希腊电台广播：希腊共产党中央委员会于五月十四日至十八日举行第七次全体会议。希共中央政治局委员伏兰达斯在会上报告称：自从希共六中全会到现在七个月以来的发展，表明了六中全会所作决议的正确性。现在，约有三十万工人卷入了罢工运动。游击队的活动，仍然成为对人民敌人的警告；民主军的主力仍然存在。保皇法西斯即使企图稍稍减轻一下国内危机，也已遭到了失败。
    伏兰达斯继而论及希腊经济的衰颓称：希腊今年二月间的工业产量，仅为一九三八年水平的百分之七十八点五。二月份冶金工业的产量，仅为战前的百分之十二，机器制造工业仅为百分之五十五，化学工业仅为百分之六十五。而希腊的农业生产，也仅为战前的百分之六十三点一。这就是美国统治的结果。
    伏兰达斯又检讨美国“援助”希腊及其资助希腊内战的结果称：希腊物资的损失共达六亿一千四百九十万美元；农业上的损失共计二亿六千一百一十万美元；自一九四六年至一九四九年，人命的损失据官方发表为十五万人，但实际数目远较此数为大。由于“援助”的结果，希腊人民现在所吃的食粮还不到战前的一半，希腊已变成西方式民主的代表国家了。根据保皇法西斯的官方数字，自一九四七年七月至一九四九年十月，就有五千三百二十二人被判死刑，其中三千零三十三人已被处死。尚有一万六千七百三十八人被判处长期徒刑，三千四百二十五人被囚禁听候审讯。
    伏兰达斯在报告中提到希腊日益增涨的罢工运动，并强调指出：取销马克罗尼索斯集中营和争取大赦的斗争，已获得国际上的声援。
    伏兰达斯报告的第二部分，曾论述了党内的各项问题。
