Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th -- Since the rectification of the Nanjing Tax Bureau's work in March and April, significant improvements have been made. Taking the collection of commercial tax as an example, the daily revenue used to be only between 5 million and 10 million yuan. Now, due to the strengthening of field work, with the continuous cracking of a large number of tax evasion cases, the daily revenue of commercial tax has exceeded 30 million yuan at its highest, and generally around 20 million yuan. The city's total revenue, excluding business tax, was 3.6 million jin of rice in January, 4 million jin in February, 5 million jin in March, and increased to 7.94 million jin in April. The tax revenue in the first half of May has exceeded the total monthly target by nearly 10,000 jin of rice. In late March this year, the bureau inspected the work of its subordinate branches and tax offices, and convened a meeting of the heads of each branch. Combining the study of documents such as the "Decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work," they carried out criticism and self-criticism, criticized the bureaucratic work style of some branch leaders who let tax collection work drift, and the "benevolent governance" viewpoint and the idea of underestimating tax work that existed among the tax staff. At the same time, the phenomenon of reversing the internal and external staff was corrected, and the field work was strengthened. The ratio of internal and external personnel was changed from the past ratio of two external and three internal to two internal and three external, and it was decided that it should gradually be changed to two external and one internal in the future. Capable cadres should be assigned to field work, and internal staff should also have quantitative and quota work. Subsequently, in April, each branch held separate cadre meetings to carry out criticism and self-criticism, review work, and improve work. After the rectification, the staff of each branch and tax office have brought into play their work enthusiasm, work methods have also been improved, and the confidence of cadres has been improved. As a result, tax revenue has increased significantly month by month.

　　南京税局整顿工作  税收数字逐月增加
    【新华社南京三十日电】南京市税务局的工作，经过三、四月份整顿以来，已经大有改进。以行商税的征收为例，过去每日收入仅在五百万元至一千万元之间，现在由于外勤工作加强，随着大批逃税案件的连续破获，每日行商税收入最高时超过三千万元，一般亦在二千万元左右。全市总收入，除营业税未计外，一月份为三百六十万斤大米，二月份为四百万斤大米，三月份为五百万斤大米，至四月份即增加为七百九十四万斤大米。五月上半个月的税收，已超过全月任务将近大米一万斤。该局在今年三月下旬，曾检查了所属各分局、各税所的工作，并召集各分局负责人开会，结合学习“中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”等文件，开展了批评和自我批评，批判了有些分局的领导干部对于税收工作放任自流的官僚主义作风，以及税收工作人员中普遍存在着的“仁政”观点与轻视税收工作的思想。同时并纠正内外勤倒置现象，加强外勤工作，将内外勤人员配备的比例从过去的外二内三改为内二外三，并决定以后逐渐做到外二内一，外勤须由得力干部充任，内勤亦须有定量定额的工作。继之各分局又于四月间分别召开干部会议，展开批评与自我批评，检讨业务，改进工作。经过整顿后，各分局和税所的工作人员都发挥了工作积极性，工作方法也有了改进，干部的信心都提高了一步。因而税收数字即逐月显著增加。
