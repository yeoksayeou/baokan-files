　　Wang Lichun Forcibly Occupies Land Case
    Juancheng County Government Should Be Responsible for Investigation and Resolution
    Editor:
    Not long ago, I received a letter from farmers in Xugai Village, Second District, Juancheng County, Pingyuan Province, exposing the fact that district and village cadres colluded to embezzle 4.1 mu of tenant farmers' land. The county government refused to resolve the issue. I am sending this letter to you, hoping it can be published in the People's Garden.
    When I returned home last year, I discovered three problems in the village: (1) Cadres took too many fruits; (2) Lack of democracy, the masses were afraid to speak; (3) Infringement on the interests of middle peasants. At that time, I discussed these issues with the village cadres. I believe what is stated in this letter is reliable and can be published in the newspaper. Otherwise, their problems will not be resolved, and the bureaucracy in the county may continue to grow.
    Sincerely,
                                          Wen Jianfeng
                                       May 21st
    Original letter from farmers in Xugai Village:
    Jianfeng:
    Since the end of the land reform, the work in our village has been proceeding smoothly, except for one issue that has not yet been resolved. The 4.1 mu of land belonging to tenant farmer Wen Yanben was forcibly occupied by Wang Lichun (a former district cadre) from Pengmiao Village. At the end of the land reform, we asked him to return it, but he refused. We went to the county to file a lawsuit, but the government did not resolve the issue, and the land was not returned. Wang Lichun said that he bought the land with money. However, Wen Yanben did not receive a single penny. Wang Lichun said, "The money was given to Guo Xianzhen (village cadre)." Later, Guo Xianzhen and Wang Lichun colluded again, saying that the money was used to buy guns. We hope that the county government will resolve this issue for us and get the land back.

    Editor's Note: If what is said in the letter is true, then Wang Lichun should not only return the forcibly occupied land to the original owner, but also be subject to considerable punishment. Other village cadres who colluded in the wrongdoing should also be punished. The Juancheng County Government should be responsible for investigating and resolving this matter.

### 王立春强占土地案  鄄城县政府应负责调查解决

　　王立春强占土地案
    鄄城县政府应负责调查解决编辑同志：
    不久前我接到平原省鄄城县二区徐垓村农民来信一封，揭露该区区干部与村干部共同作弊，侵占佃户的四亩一分地。县政府不给解决。我将这封信寄给你们，希望能在人民园地发表。
    我去年回家，发现村子里有三个问题：（一）干部占有果实过多；（二）不民主，群众不敢说话；（三）侵犯中农利益。当时我同村干部讨论过这个问题。这封信上所谈的，我认为是可靠的，可以在报上发表。否则，他们的问题得不到解决，县里的官僚主义也可能继续增长。
    此致敬礼！
                                          温剑风
                                       五月二十一日
    徐垓村农民来信原文剑风：
    自土地改革结束以后，咱村里的工作进行得还算顺利，就只有一件事情尚未解决。佃户温衍本的四亩一分地，过去被彭庙村的王立春（过去的区干部）强占了去。在土地改革结束时，我们要他退回，他不给。我们赴县打官司，政府不给解决，地也没有交回。王立春说，地是他花钱买的。可是温衍本一文钱也没收到。王立春说：“把钱交给郭现振（村干部）啦。”后来郭现振与王立春又共同作弊，说钱是买枪用了。我们希望县政府给我们解决这个问题，把地要回来。

    编者按：信中所说如果属实，则王立春不但应把强占去的土地退还原主，还应受到相当的处分。其他共同作弊的村干部亦应受处分。鄄城县府应负责调查解决。
