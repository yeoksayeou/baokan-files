Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang - A unit of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army, which returned to the northern Manchurian reclamation area to engage in agricultural production, has launched a large-scale land reclamation and sowing campaign. Including the fallow land opened up during the harrowing period, the unit expects to reclaim more than 360,000 mu this year, and 4,785 mu for vegetable gardens. After deducting production costs and 500 jin of grain handed over to the public per person, each person can still earn a surplus of 481 jin of coarse grain from the total harvest.

The heroic commanders and fighters who fought north and south, after arriving in the Heilongjiang area, were warmly welcomed and thoroughly assisted by the local government, troops, and people, and immediately rushed to the production front. The unit first carried out the work of surveying land, purchasing agricultural tools, allocating manpower, and selecting seeds, and also conducted investigations and research on climate and soil. In terms of labor organization, the unit stipulated that a production unit should be composed of 57 draft animals and 150 laborers. Through agricultural production education, cadres and soldiers have initially mastered the farming knowledge and agricultural tool techniques in the northern Manchurian grasslands. Since mid-March, the production advance team has braved the severe cold to complete the necessary preparatory work such as logging, building houses, digging wells, building warehouses, and transporting grain in the snowy and icy weather. In just one month, they have built countless brand-new farms on the endless grasslands. In the "Great Northern Wilderness" (place name), which stretches 40 li from east to west and 90 li from north to south, a certain unit has opened up five farms, built more than 330 barracks, and dug more than a dozen large-scale water wells. After the completion of various preparatory tasks, large contingents of people marched mightily to the land where the ice and snow melted, and launched intensive labor production, moving towards the goal of transforming the wilderness into fertile land.

　　四野某部返北满
    大规模垦荒播种
    全年可开荒三十六万亩
    【新华社沈阳电】返回北满垦区从事农业生产的人民解放军第四野战军某部，已展开大规模的垦荒播种运动。连同铲趟期间开辟的秋伏地在内，该部预计今年垦荒三十六万余亩，菜地四千七百八十五亩。全部收获除扣除生产成本及每人交公五百斤粮食以外，每人尚可赢余四百八十一斤粗粮。
    转战南北的英勇指战员自到达黑龙江地区后，在当地政府、部队和人民的热烈欢迎与周密协助之下，随即奔赴生产战线。该部首先进行了勘察土地、购置农具、调配人力、挑选种子的工作，同时对于气候土壤也作了调查研究。在劳动组织方面，该部规定以五十七匹畜力和一百五十个人力组成一个生产单位。通过农业生产教育，干部、战士们初步掌握了在北满草原的耕作知识和使用农具的技术。自三月中旬起，生产先遣队即冒着严寒在冰天雪地中完成伐木、盖房、打井、建仓、运粮等项必需的准备工程。仅一个月的时间，他们已在一望无际的草原上建筑起无数崭新的农庄。某部在东西四十华里南北九十华里的“北大荒”（地名），开辟了五个农场，盖好营房三百三十余间，开好大型水井十余个。当各项准备工作相继完成后，大队人马便浩浩荡荡地开到冰消雪融的土地上，展开了紧张的劳动生产，向着变荒野为良田的目标迈进。
