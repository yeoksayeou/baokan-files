　　GuiSui Office
    Launches Anti-Bureaucracy Struggle
    [Our Newspaper GuiSui Dispatch] The leadership cadres of the Baotou Engineering Section of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, without relying on the masses and relying solely on outdated experience, drafted a medium-repair engineering plan. After construction began, they also failed to conduct thorough on-site inspections, resulting in a loss of 10,000 catties of millet in the first few days of the project. After learning of this, the GuiSui Office has instructed the leading cadres of the section to conduct a thorough self-criticism and has requested the sub-bureau to give appropriate punishment to the individual responsible. At the same time, it has issued a circular to all its subordinate units, urging them to combine the study of Minister Teng Daiyuan's essay "Eradicating Bureaucratic Styles in the Railway System" and launch an in-depth anti-bureaucracy struggle.

　　归绥办事处
    开展反官僚主义斗争
    【本报归绥讯】张家口铁路分局归绥办事处包头工务段领导干部没有依靠群众，仅凭老一套的经验拟订中修工程计划，开工后也不深入现场检查，在工程开始的头几天，即损失小米一万斤。归绥办事处得悉后，已责成该段领导干部进行深刻检讨，并请示分局给予个别主要负责人以应得处分。同时并通令所属各单位结合学习滕代远部长“铲除铁路系统中官僚主义作风”的论文，展开深入的反官僚主义斗争。
