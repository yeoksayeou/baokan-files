How to Prevent and Control Cotton Seedling Wilt
Cotton Reform Office, Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture

Since the rain on June 1st in the vicinity of Baoding City, some cotton seedlings have withered, especially in low-lying areas. Upon careful inspection, the cotton seedlings have root rot, and there are lesions on the cotyledons. The reason is that after the rain, the soil is damp and the temperature is low, so the anthracnose fungus takes the opportunity to develop. This disease not only harms seedlings but will also grow on cotton leaves and cotton bolls in the future (cotton boll anthracnose is just "jiang疙瘩," a local term for a cotton boll disease). If measures are not taken to prevent and control it now, it may continue to develop and affect yield.

Prevention and Control Methods:

1. After the rain, quickly hoe the field to loosen the soil and allow air circulation. Expose it to the sun for a few days to prevent the occurrence and development of anthracnose.

2. In low-lying cotton fields, dig drainage ditches to prevent water accumulation.

3. The distance between cotton plants in low-lying areas should be greater, not too dense. Good ventilation can avoid the spread of anthracnose.

　　怎样防治棉苗枯死
    河北省农业厅棉改处
    保定市附近自六月一日下雨以后，有的棉苗就枯死了，特别是低洼地方死的多，经仔细检查，棉苗烂根，子叶上有病斑，原因是雨后土壤潮湿，气温降低，炭疽病菌就趁机发生。这病不但要害幼苗，将来还要长在棉花叶上、棉桃上（棉桃炭疽病就是疆疙瘩），现在要是不设法防治，可能还继续发展，影响产量。
    防治法：
    １、雨后赶快锄一遍，使土壤疏松空气流通，晴天晒几天，可防止炭疽病的发生和发展。
    ２、低洼的棉田，可掘排水沟，不使存水。
    ３、低洼地定棉棵的距离要远一些，不可太密，通风能避免传染炭疽病。
