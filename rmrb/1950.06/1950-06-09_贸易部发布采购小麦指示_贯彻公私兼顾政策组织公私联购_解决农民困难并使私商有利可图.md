Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, noting that wheat will soon be on the market nationwide, and in view of the generally better wheat harvest this year compared to previous years, and the need for farmers to sell large quantities of wheat, has issued instructions to local trade departments to implement the policy of balancing public and private interests in order to solve the difficulties of farmers selling wheat and to make private merchants' transportation profitable. In the management of wheat procurement, private merchants should be given the same convenience as state-owned trading institutions for their legitimate business activities. The instructions also made the following specific provisions, ordering the trade departments of major administrative regions, the five provinces of North China, and Beijing and Tianjin's commercial departments and bureaus to comply with them.

　　1. The main task of state-owned trading institutions in mastering the procurement market is to control the wheat price policy and the rational price difference between production and sales areas, so that private merchants have reasonable profits for transportation; the previous dominance thinking in procurement should be overcome. When private merchants comply with the wheat price policy, their procurement requirements should be met.

　　2. In order to adjust the public-private relationship in procurement, large and medium-sized cities can organize wheat joint procurement committees (under the leadership of the Commercial Bureau, with representatives from state-owned grain companies, flour mills, and grain traders' and grain processors' trade associations) in order to understand the procurement funding situation, formulate procurement plans, reasonably allocate procurement areas, and notify the government's industry and commerce departments in the procurement areas to cooperate. The industry and commerce departments of the government in the procurement areas should closely monitor the market's sales situation at all times. If there is a small amount of supply and many buyers, appropriate allocation should be made between public and private entities, and between local and foreign merchants, based on the proportion of their procurement funds, so as to avoid competitive purchases and rising wheat prices.

　　3. Those who do not wish to participate in joint procurement are free to go to the countryside and freely purchase and transport in the market. Local industry and commerce departments must not impose restrictions such as quotas or licenses.

　　4. When public and private manufacturers need assistance from the industry and commerce departments of the procurement area for large-scale purchases, they can register with the local industry and commerce departments for assistance.

　　Grain companies and industrial and commercial administrative departments at all levels should, based on the above principles and in conjunction with local specific conditions, study and organize wheat joint procurement work, and report the organization and implementation situation to the Ministry of Trade at any time.

　　贸易部发布采购小麦指示
    贯彻公私兼顾政策组织公私联购
    解决农民困难并使私商有利可图
    【新华社八日讯】中央人民政府贸易部以全国各地小麦即将先后上市，鉴于今年麦收情况一般较往年为好，农民需要大量卖出小麦，为解决农民出售小麦的困难，和使私商贩运有利可图，特指示各地贸易部门，应贯彻公私兼顾的政策，在小麦采购的管理上，对私商的合法的业务活动给予和国营贸易机关同样的便利。指示并作了下列各项具体规定，令各大行政区贸易部、华北五省及北京、天津的商业厅、局，遵照执行。
    一、国营贸易机构对收购市场的掌握，主要是掌握麦价政策，及产销地区合理差价，使私商贩运有合理利润；应克服以往采购上的统治思想。在私商遵守麦价政策时，应满足其采购要求。
    二、为调整采购中的公私关系，各大、中城市可组织小麦联购委员会（在商业局领导下，由国营粮食公司，面粉工厂及粮食贩卖业、粮食加工业同业公会代表参加），以便了解采购资金情况，订立采购计划，合理分配采购地区，并通知采购地区政府工商部门，以便配合。采购地区政府之工商部门，应随时密切了解市场的上销情况，如遇上量少，购买者多时，应就公私之间，本地商人与外籍商人之间，就其采购资金之比例，作适当分配，以免发生争购，造成麦价上涨。
    三、凡不愿参加联购者，得自由下乡及在市场自由采购贩运。各地工商部门不得加以限量、证照等限制。
    四、公私厂商大宗收购，需要采购地区工商部门协助时，可到该地工商部门办理登记，以便协助。
    各级粮食公司及工商行政部门，应根据以上原则，结合当地具体情况，研究组织小麦联购工作，并将组织与实施情形随时报告贸易部。
