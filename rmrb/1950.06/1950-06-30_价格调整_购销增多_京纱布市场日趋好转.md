　　Price Adjustments and Increased Sales
    Beijing Cotton Cloth Market Gradually Improves

    [This Newspaper] The Beijing cotton cloth market has shown improvement. Current listed prices are approaching market prices, and regional price differences have become reasonable. The Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's business is expanding.

    Since March, inflation has gradually stopped, and financial prices have become stable. False purchasing power has disappeared from the market. At this time, cotton cloth became unsalable, and private merchants were selling off their stocks, resulting in an abnormal situation where listed prices were higher than market prices, and production area prices were higher than sales area prices. The situation was most severe in mid-April. Taking the Erchang Wufu cloth as an example, the listed price of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company was 265,000 yuan per bolt, while the market price was 230,000 yuan, a difference of 35,000 yuan. The price difference between production and sales areas was inverted. The price in Zhangjiakou was 20,000 yuan lower than in Beijing, resulting in losses on transportation and sales, and merchants were taking a wait-and-see attitude. At that time, the Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company virtually withdrew from the market. Currently, the Beijing cotton cloth market is improving daily. The reasons are: (1) The government has taken a series of measures to adjust the relationship between public and private industry and commerce, increasing the enthusiasm of private merchants to operate; (2) The Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company adjusted its listed prices; (3) The Tianjin market saw purchases by Northeast grain merchants and Northwest fur merchants; Zhangjiakou also saw activity by fur merchants, and the price of cotton cloth gradually increased, making the prices between production and sales areas more reasonable. Beijing merchants purchased goods, and the flow of materials became normal; (4) The inventory hoarded by private merchants before March has been sold off, shops are restocking, and private purchases are picking up, with transactions showing signs of improvement; (5) Interest rates in the financial market have repeatedly decreased, and the securities market is stable, causing funds to shift to the commodity market; (6) After the liberation of Zhoushan, the shipping blockade was lifted, and the prices of import and export commodities rose, stimulating the purchasing psychology of general merchants; (7) A good wheat harvest is expected, and rural purchasing power will increase.

    Currently, the listed price and market price of cotton cloth in Beijing are approaching each other. From June 10th to the present, the listed price of Erchang Wufu cloth at the Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is 255,000 yuan per bolt, and the market price is 253,000 yuan, a difference of only 2,000 yuan. The price difference between production and sales areas has also become normal. The price in Beijing is now about 10,000 yuan lower than in Zhangjiakou, and merchants are becoming active again. As a result, the Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company re-entered the market in late May, and the volume of transactions has been increasing daily. By mid-June, business had further expanded.

### 价格调整·购销增多  京纱布市场日趋好转

　　价格调整·购销增多
    京纱布市场日趋好转
    【本报讯】京市花纱布市场已趋好转，现牌价与市价接近，地区价格差额亦已合理，京花纱布公司业务日见开展。
    三月以来，通货膨胀逐渐停止，金融物价渐趋稳定，市场虚假购买力消失。此时纱布即形滞销，私商又在抛售，乃形成牌价高于市价、产地价高于销地价的不正常现象。情况最严重时为四月中旬，花纱布公司牌价以二厂五福布为例，牌价每匹二十六万五千元、市价二十三万元，相差竟达三万五千元。产地销地价格差额倒挂，张垣价格竟低于本市达二万元，运销折本，客商观望。当时，京花纱布公司曾无形中退出市场。目前京市纱布市场已日见好转。其原因是：（一）政府采取一连串调整公私营工商业关系的措施，私商经营积极性增强；（二）京花纱布公司调整了牌价；（三）天津市场因东北粮商、西北皮毛商吸购；张垣亦因皮毛商活动，纱布价格均渐上升，产销地区价格趋向合理，本市客商购进，物资流转趋于正常；（四）私商在三月份以前囤积的存货已抛售殆尽，店铺补货，私人购用，交易因见起色；（五）金融市场利率一再降低，证券市场稳定，资金转向商品市场；（六）舟山解放后航运封锁解除，进出口商品价格上游，带动一般商人吸购心理；（七）麦收看好，乡村购买力将有增加。
    现在，京市纱布牌市价已相接近，自六月十日迄今，京花纱布公司牌价二厂五福布每匹二十五万五千元，市价为二十五万三千元，相差仅二千元。产销地区价格差额亦已正常，现京地价低于张垣达万元上下，客商又呈活跃。因之，京花纱布公司于五月下旬起又重入市场，交易额已日有增加，至六月中业务已更见开展了。
