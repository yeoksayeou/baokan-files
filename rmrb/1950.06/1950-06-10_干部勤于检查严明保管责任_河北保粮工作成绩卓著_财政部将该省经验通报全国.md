　　Cadres Diligent in Inspection, Clearly Defining Storage Responsibility
    Hebei's Grain Protection Work Achieves Remarkable Results
    Ministry of Finance Circulates the Province's Experience Nationwide
    [Xinhua News Agency, 9th] The Hebei Provincial People's Government conducted two major grain inspections in March and April this year, ensuring that the 150 million jin of public grain stored in six granaries across eight special districts did not suffer damage during the rainy season. It also uncovered a large quantity of millet, wheat, white flour, firewood, coal, and other items. The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government is circulating the province's grain protection experience nationwide, urging all regions to improve grain storage work.

    The reasons for Hebei Province's success in this grain protection work are, first, the provincial government's emphasis on public grain storage, especially the great importance attached to this work by Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, who frequently urged grain agencies: "We must do a good job in grain work." As a result, the Provincial Grain Bureau has been working very hard on this task. To prevent public grain from spoiling, the bureau organized inspection teams as early as early March to go to various special districts and counties to conduct major granary inspections in coordination with local grain work cadres, and emphasized the establishment of systems and strengthening of inspections. In mid-April, when the province experienced widespread heavy rain, the bureau again instructed all localities to carefully inspect granaries and salvage damaged public grain. Cadres sent to inspect granaries in various places were mostly able to personally take action, threshing, drying, and clearing warehouses, and constantly educating granary staff to improve their ideological and professional levels, and actively contacting local administrative departments to work together. At the same time, many local administrative officials also attached great importance to public grain storage work. For example, the Commissioner of Baoding Special District often personally went to granaries for inspection, and the County Head and Public Security Bureau Chief of Mancheng County led cadres to rescue granaries in heavy rain. Another example is the County Head of Cixian County, who personally served as the stationmaster of the transfer station during the transportation of grain, ensuring the smooth completion of the county's transportation task. Secondly, constantly improving the understanding of grain warehouse cadres on protecting grain, strictly enforcing rewards and punishments, and strengthening the sense of responsibility of cadres at all levels are important keys to the province's success in grain protection work. Many granary cadres in the province collect and distribute grain during the day and stand guard at night, uniting the masses and rescuing grain in the rain. Many model examples have emerged in various places. For example, the Director of Zhuoxian Grain Depot tied a rope around his waist and had someone pull him to the top of a large grain pile to organize the grain; the Director of Qian'an County Depot led all cadres to personally thresh and dry about 200,000 jin of rice from three rice depots; Cui Wuchang, Yang Zhenhua, Yang Zhenjia and other staff members of Dingxian Grain Depot rescued 600,000 jin of millet in the rain; and the Yongqing County Branch Depot discovered that the warehouse was about to collapse, and all staff members rescued the grain in the rain, risking their lives. Although the house collapsed, 200,000 jin of grain were not damaged. For these model behaviors, governments at all levels have given commendations and rewards respectively; and for individual cadres who are not active in their work and lack a sense of responsibility, they have been criticized and educated separately. Because rewards and punishments are clear, the enthusiasm of the staff has been generally improved. Third, the establishment and adherence to the grain storage system. During the two major grain inspections of the Provincial Grain Bureau, special attention was paid to establishing the system and inspecting the implementation of the system. According to statistics from five special districts in the province: at present, 80% of the counties have established a personal responsibility system, 70% of the counties have established a regular inspection system, and 57% of the counties have established mass grain protection organizations. Fourth, the province can rely on the masses to carry out grain protection work. For example, 80% of the counties in Shijiazhuang Special District have established neighborhood grain protection groups around the warehouses. Because the grain cadres in Wanxian mobilized the masses, many people helped to rescue the grain during the rain, saying: "It doesn't matter if our clothes get wet, as long as we save the grain." After Wang Laorui of Bochang Village, Dingxian County, was elected as a grain protection committee member, he even gave up his plan to go to the city to see a night show. A woman surnamed Feng in Chengguan, Huolu County, actively publicized grain protection to residents and helped establish a grain protection group under the call of the grain warehouse cadres. These are all very prominent examples.

　　干部勤于检查严明保管责任
    河北保粮工作成绩卓著
    财政部将该省经验通报全国
    【新华社九日讯】河北省人民政府在今春三、四月间曾举行了两次粮食大检查，使全省八个专区六个粮库所存一亿五千万斤公粮，虽在霉雨季节未遭损害，并清查出大批小米、小麦、白面、柴煤等。中央人民政府财政部特将该省保粮经验通报全国，并要求各地作好粮食保管工作。
    河北省获得此次保粮工作成绩的原因，首先是省府重视公粮保管，尤其是河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席十分重视这一工作，他经常督促粮食机关：“一定要将粮食工作作好。”因之省粮食局对这一工作抓得很紧。为防止公粮霉坏，该局早在三月初即组织检查团分赴各专区、各县，配合当地粮食工作干部进行粮库大检查，并强调建立制度和加强检查。四月中旬，该省普降透雨之际，该局又指示各地认真检查粮库，抢救受损公粮。派赴各地检查粮库的干部，多能亲自下手，捣晒清仓，并随时教育粮库工作人员，提高其思想和业务水平，主动联系地方行政部门，共同工作。同时，很多地方行政负责干部也很重视公粮保管工作，如保定专区专员常亲自到粮库进行检查，满城县长和公安局长于大雨滂沱中率领干部抢救粮库。又如磁县县长在调运粮食中亲任转运站站长，使该县调运任务得以顺利完成。其次，不断提高粮仓干部对保护粮食的认识，严明赏罚，加强各级干部的责任心，这是该省做好保粮工作的重要关键。该省许多粮库干部白天收发粮食，晚上站岗放哨，团结群众，冒雨抢救粮食，各地曾涌现了许多模范事例。如涿县粮库主任用绳索绑在腰间，让人将他拽到大粮囤的顶上去整理粮食；迁安县库主任带领全体干部亲自捣晒三个米库约二十余万斤；定县粮库工作人员崔五常、杨振华、杨振甲等冒雨抢救小米六十万斤；永清县分库发现库房将塌，全体工作人员冒雨冒险抢救，结果房屋虽塌，而二十万斤粮食未受损失。对于这些模范行为，各级政府都曾分别给以表扬和奖励；而对于个别工作不积极，责任心不强的干部，都分别予以批评、教育。因为赏罚分明，工作人员的积极性普遍提高。第三，建立和坚持了粮食保管制度。该省粮食局两次粮食大检查中都曾特别注意建立制度检查制度施行的情形。据该省五个专区统计：目前百分之八十的县份已建立了个人负责制，百分之七十的县份建立了定期检查制，百分之五十七的县份建立了群众护粮组织。第四，该省能依靠群众来进行保粮工作。如石家庄专区百分之八十的县份已建立仓库四邻的护仓小组。完县的粮食干部因发动了群众，在雨中抢救粮食时，许多人不辞辛苦地帮助抢救，他们说：“衣服湿了不要紧，只要把粮食救起来就好了。”定县伯裳村王老瑞当选护粮委员后，连到城里看一次夜戏的打算都放弃了。获鹿县城关一位姓冯的妇女在粮仓工作干部的号召下，积极向居民宣传护粮，帮助建立了护粮小组。这些都是很显著的例子。
