　　Land Reform Improves Agricultural Productivity
    Huangtugang Village Strives to Achieve Increased Production Plan
    If there are no special disasters, this year's harvest will increase by 21% compared to normal years, and more than triple last year's production.
    [Our Newspaper] Land reform has achieved the effect of developing agricultural production in Huangtugang Village, Fifteenth District, near Beijing. This year, the village's crop yield will increase by 21% compared to normal years, and triple the harvest of last year, which was affected by disaster. Huangtugang Village has a total of 377 households, 1,571 people, and 5,326.9 mu of land (1,657 mu of paddy fields, 3,569.9 mu of dry land). Before liberation, landlords, rich peasants, and landlords cum capitalists accounted for 16.6% of the village's population and owned 55% of the village's land; the peasant population accounted for 83.4% and owned 45% of the land. In the land reform, the farmers of the village obtained land, livestock, and farm tools, and the relations of production changed. Poor and hired peasants have extremely high production enthusiasm, and middle peasants, who paid attention to unity from the beginning of the land reform and were influenced by the poor peasants, are also generally active in production. Rich peasants also have a very stable production mood. The number of rich peasants in the village participating in main labor has increased from 13 men and 6 women in the past to 15 men and 9 women. Currently, 10 landlords and 7 landladies are now working in the fields.
    Before the start of spring plowing this year, under the leadership of the village production guidance committee, each household generally formulated a production plan. The village plan is as follows: 20 households to reclaim 27.2 mu of wasteland and abandoned land, 41 households to convert 12.2 mu of dry land into paddy fields, 37 households to change 117.19 mu of paddy fields, which are planted two seasons each year, to three seasons, and 52 households to plant 12.8 mu more of "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes. Because the peasants have high production enthusiasm, and through everyone's efforts, as of now, 41 households have reclaimed 55.1 mu of wasteland and abandoned land, of which 22.5 mu have been developed into paddy fields, 54 households have converted 159.5 mu of dry land into paddy fields, 42 households have increased the planting of the original two-season paddy fields by 117.2 mu to three seasons, increased the planting of 12.2 mu of dry land to two seasons, increased the planting of 11 mu of dry land to three seasons, and 73 households increased the planting of "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes by 120.3 mu. The current achievements far exceed the plan.
    This year, the village planted a total of 1,564.8 mu of early-maturing crops, with an estimated yield equivalent to 5,598.6 shi of corn; 2,374 mu of autumn crops, with a yield of 2,004.62 shi of corn; 639.4 mu of special crops, with a yield of 1,638.7 shi of corn; 258.5 mu of vegetables, with a yield of 1,978 shi of corn; 30 mu of melons, with a yield equivalent to 300 shi of corn; in addition, 750.3 mu of three-season crops in orchards. The total sowing area of ​​the village is 4,866.7 mu. If there are no special disasters, it is estimated that 11,520 shi of corn can be harvested, which is 21% higher than the normal yield of 9,500 shi, and more than triple the yield of 2,700 shi during the disaster last year.

　　土地改革提高了农业生产力
    黄土岗村努力实现增产计划
    如无特殊灾情今年收获将较常年增多百分之二十一，较去年增产三倍多。
    【本报讯】土地改革已在京郊十五区黄土岗村收到了发展农业生产的效果。该村今年农作物产量将较常年增加百分之二十一，比去年遭受灾荒的收获量增加三倍。黄土岗村共有三百七十七户，一千五百七十一人，土地五千三百二十六点九亩（水地一、六五七亩，旱地三、五六九·九亩）。解放前全村地主、富农及地主兼资本家占人口百分之十六点六，占有全村土地百分之五十五；农民人口占百分之八十三点四，占有土地百分之四十五。该村农民在土地改革中，获得了土地、牲畜、农具，生产关系起了变化。贫雇农生产情绪极高，中农也由于土改开始时即注意了团结，并在贫农的影响下，一般都生产积极。富农生产情绪也很安定。全村富农参加主要劳动的，过去男十三人、女六人，现已增为男十五人、女九人。现在地主已有男十人、女七人下地劳动。
    今年春耕开始前，该村在村生产指导委员会领导下，各户普遍地制订了生产计划。全村计划为：二十户开荒地、废地二十七点二亩，四十一户改十二点二亩旱地为水地，三十七户将每年种二季的水地一百十七点一九亩，改种三季，五十二户多种“胜利一○○号”白薯十二点八亩。因为农民生产情绪高，经大家努力，截至目前止，已有四十一户开了荒地和废地五十五点一亩，其中并有二十二点五亩已开成水地，五十四户将一百五十九点五亩旱地改成水地，四十二户将原种二季的水地一百十七点二亩增种三季，将十二点二亩旱地增种二季，十一亩旱地增种三季，七十三户增种“胜利一○○号”白薯一百二十点三亩。现有成绩已远超过计划。
    该村今年共种早熟作物一千五百六十四点八亩，产量约折合五千五百九十八点六石玉米；大秋作物二千三百七十四亩，产量二千零四点六二石玉米；特种作物六百三十九点四亩，产量一千六百三十八点七石玉米；蔬菜二百五十八点五亩，产量一千九百七十八石玉米，瓜类三十亩，产量合三百石玉米；另外种三季作物园地七百五十点三亩。总计全村播种面积四千八百六十六点七亩，如无特殊灾情估计可收获一万一千五百二十石玉米，比常年产量九千五百石增高百分之二十一，比去年灾荒时产量二千七百石增加了三倍多。
