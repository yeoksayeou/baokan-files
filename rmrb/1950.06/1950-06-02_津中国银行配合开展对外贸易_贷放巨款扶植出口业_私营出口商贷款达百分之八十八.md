　　Tianjin Branch of Bank of China Cooperates in Foreign Trade
    Huge Loans Support Export Industry
    Loans to Private Exporters Reach 88 Percent
    [Tianjin News] According to the Tianjin Daily, the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China, in order to cooperate with the development of foreign trade and support export manufacturers, issued various loans totaling more than 270 billion RMB from January to April this year. Under the overall business plan of the Bank of China's Head Office and the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank, from January to April, it issued export loans of approximately 39.2 billion RMB, approximately 4.95 million US dollars in foreign currency, and 60.5 billion RMB for inter-port import acceptance and overseas purchasing loans, totaling approximately 275.3 billion RMB in all loans. Of these, loans to private manufacturers reached 88.08 percent, while state-owned enterprises accounted for 11.92 percent.
    In its lending practices, the bank took into consideration the difficulties faced by export manufacturers, and continuously improved its operations based on varying price situations, providing support through various means. During the period of price fluctuations in January and February, the bank tightened lending to cooperate with stabilizing prices, but continued to provide appropriate assistance to manufacturers, particularly factories, that were able to secure foreign exchange in a timely manner but faced real difficulties in working capital. For example, at that time, Jufeng Trading Company, Renli Company, and Yuanxing Carpet Factory had already finalized orders with foreign countries and planned to export, but were unable to pay wages and purchase raw materials due to a shortage of funds. The bank helped them solve their difficulties. Furthermore, when foreign exchange rates rose, manufacturers had concerns. To boost the morale of manufacturers, the bank promptly issued loans and provided interest rate concessions (market lending rates at that time were about 60 percent per month, while the Bank of China charged only 19 to 24 percent per month). After March, as prices stabilized and fell, and foreign exchange rates declined several times, manufacturers' interest in inter-port import acceptance in local currency and overseas purchasing loans gradually waned. The bank then focused on promoting foreign currency loans to prevent the stagnation of urban-rural material exchange and exports. At the same time, to closely connect with manufacturers, understand export conditions, promote business, inspect the use of loans, and listen to manufacturers' opinions in order to improve business and provide assistance, the bank frequently sent field staff to factories and shops. In addition, it also held seminars, combining the bank's business with private manufacturers to jointly study export issues, truly achieving mutual benefit for both public and private interests. Sometimes, private manufacturers also took the initiative to request the bank to hold seminars.

　　津中国银行配合开展对外贸易
    贷放巨款扶植出口业
    私营出口商贷款达百分之八十八
    【天津讯】据天津日报消息：天津中国银行为配合开展对外贸易，扶植出口厂商，本年一至四月间，共发放各种贷款二千七百余亿元。该行在中国银行总管理处及人民银行天津分行总的业务计划下，一至四月份，共发放出口贷款人民币约三百九十二亿余元，外币约四百九十五万美元，埠际进口押汇和赴外采购贷款六百零五亿元，合计全部贷款约二千七百五十三亿元。其中贷给私营厂商者即达百分之八十八点零八，公营占百分之十一点九二。
    该行在贷款中，为照顾出口厂商困难，根据不同的物价情况，随时改进业务，通过各种方式对其进行扶助。在一、二月份物价波动期间，该行为了配合平抑物价，曾紧缩放款，但对于部分能够及时争取外汇而在资金周转上确有困难的厂商，特别是工厂，则仍适当地予以照顾。如当时聚丰贸易行、仁立公司和源兴地毯工厂，已和国外洽妥定单，并已计划出口，但由于资金短绌开付不了工资和无法收购原料，该行即曾帮助他们解决了困难。又当外汇牌价上提时，厂商在思想上有顾虑，该行为了提高厂商经营情绪，曾及时地进行放款，并从利息上予以照顾（当时市场放款利率约月息六十分，而中行仅月息十九至二十四分）。三月份以后，物价稳落，外汇牌价数度挂低，厂商对本币埠际进口押汇和外埠采购贷款兴趣渐淡，该行则又重点推进外币贷款，使城乡物资交流及出口不致停滞。同时，该行为了密切联系厂商，了解出口情况，并宣传业务，检查放款用途及听取厂商意见，以便改进业务和进行帮助，曾经常派外勤人员到工厂商店中去。此外，还通过座谈方式，结合该行业务和私营厂商共同研究出口问题，真正做到了公私兼顾。有时，私营厂商亦主动要求该行召开座谈会。
