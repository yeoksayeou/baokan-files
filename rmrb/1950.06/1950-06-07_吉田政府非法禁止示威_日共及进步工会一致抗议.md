    [Xinhua News Agency, June 6th] The Japanese Communist Party and progressive trade unions unanimously protested against the Yoshida government, a tool of the American occupiers, for illegally depriving the people of their freedom of assembly and demonstration. According to a Kyodo News Agency Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Communist Party Senators Kikunami Katsumi, Kazahaya Yasoji, Tsuchibashi Ikkichi, and Party Election Measures Department Chief Iwata Eiichi, met with Yoshida Cabinet Chief Secretary Okazaki Katsuo on the 3rd to protest the Yoshida government's measures to prohibit demonstrations in Tokyo, stating: "This is a unilateral and provocative measure exceeding the government's authority." On the same day, Kazahaya Yasoji and the General Secretary of the All-Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union, Shindo, jointly protested to the Tokyo Police Department against the illegal ban on the "June 3rd" demonstration.
    The All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee held a meeting of its executive committee on the 3rd and issued a statement saying that the Yoshida government's ban on assemblies and demonstrations is a planned measure to realize its plot to colonize Japan.
