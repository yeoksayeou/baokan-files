Tunxi Farmers' Service Center Business Development: Nearly 20,000 Farmers Housed in Ten Months

[Our Tunxi Dispatch] The Tunxi Municipal Farmers' Service Center in Southern Anhui Province was established on July 28, 1949, under the leadership of the Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In nearly ten months since then, it has made significant achievements in its business operations. Last year, the service center had only seven people. This year, in order to help farmers promote tea sales during the tea season and expand its business, a branch office was established in Liyang in the same city, adding six more people. For the convenience of farmers, the service center headquarters also established a business department (supplied with goods by the cooperative) to supply farmers' necessities such as cloth, salt, oil, matches, and bowls at prices lower than the market price.

In terms of food, there is a private farmers' restaurant led by the Farmers' Service Center, which makes food that is both delicious and affordable for farmers. Accommodation costs are also very low. Generally, staying overnight costs a farmer no more than one jin of rice, and blankets are also provided for farmers to avoid freezing in the winter. From July 28 last year to May 28 this year, in a ten-month period, 19,496 farmers have stayed at the Farmers' Service Center. The tea promoted by the service center for farmers amounted to 140,000 jin from its establishment last year to the end of the year. This year, from May 1st to the 28th, in just one month, it has promoted more than 141,000 jin.

Why have such achievements been made? In addition to the low cost of the service center, there are the following reasons:

First, the cadres of the service center have a sincere spirit of serving the farmers wholeheartedly, which has enabled the farmers who stay there to gradually establish a deep affection for the service center. When it was first established, no one came for three days because the farmers were worried and afraid of the cadres wearing military uniforms. After propaganda and explanation, especially the cadres' very diligent reception of the farmers, and the safekeeping of important items for the farmers without any losses, the farmers felt that the service center was as 친밀한 as returning home, and the number of farmers staying there gradually increased, from three or five people to a maximum of 399 people a day. When the farmers returned to their villages, they naturally promoted the Farmers' Service Center. Especially this year, the farmers who stayed seemed to be organized, with some coming in groups of thirty or forty people. Individually, some stayed particularly frequently, with some staying up to one hundred times. The farmers who come to stay at the service center include those from several provinces, including Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui.

Secondly, the service center also provides farmers with convenient conditions for recreational and other activities, making the farmers feel as if they have entered a university when they arrive at the service center. The center subscribes to the Southern Anhui Daily and the Liberation Daily, and literate people can read freely. Those who are illiterate are given special lectures on policies and read newspapers by the director of the center, Yang Shufan, and other staff members. The current market prices are also announced to the farmers every day. Farmers holding a letter of introduction from the center receive a 30% discount at cinemas, theaters, and bathhouses, and can be given priority purchase at tea collection stations at more favorable prices.

Furthermore, the center earnestly helps farmers solve specific difficulties, making the farmers realize that the service center is truly serving them. For example, Ding Zhongxian, an old tea farmer from Dongxiang, She County, brought five jin of tea to Tunxi last year but couldn't sell it, and was on the verge of tears. When the center saw this situation, it bought his tea at the market price. Ding Zhongxian was moved and said, "The Communist Party is so good! It is truly one with the people and has saved my emergency!"

In this way, more and more farmers are attracted to the service center every day. The business of the Farmers' Service Center is also expanding day by day. (Xiao Niu, Tunxi City, Southern Anhui)

　　屯溪农民服务所业务发展  十个月住所农民近两万人
    【本报屯溪讯】皖南区屯溪市农民服务所，在市人民政府与中共市委的领导下，于一九四九年七月二十八日成立，到现在将近十个月，在业务的经营上已做出显著成绩。去年服务所只有七人，今年为了在茶季帮助农民推销茶叶，开展业务，又在该市黎阳设立了一个分所，增加了六个人。为了农民的方便，服务总所又设立了一个营业部（由合作社供给货物），低于市价供应布、食盐、油、洋火、碗等农民必需品。
    在吃的方面，有农民服务所领导的私营农民饭店，特为农民作又好吃又便宜的饭。住所的费用也很低廉，一般住宿一晚，一人至多不超过一斤米，同时还替农民准备了被子，冬天不致受冻。从去年七月二十八日到今年五月二十八日十个月，到农民服务所住宿的农民达一万九千四百九十六人。服务所帮助农民推销的茶叶，从去年成立到年底是十四万斤，今年从五月一日到二十八日不过一月，就推销了十四万一千余斤。
    为什么会有这样的成绩呢？除了服务所费用的低廉外，还有以下几个原因：
    首先是服务所的干部具有诚心诚意为农民服务的精神，使住所农民逐渐与服务所建立了深厚的感情。刚成立时，三天没人上门，因农民有顾虑，怕穿军衣的干部。后经宣传解释，特别是干部招待农民非常殷勤，替农民保管重要东西，从未遗失，使农民感觉到了服务所就好像回到了家一样亲切，住所的农民也就日渐增多，由三人五人，增加至最多一天到三百九十九人。农民回到乡村，自然的就替农民服务所做了宣传，特别是今年住所农民好似有了组织，有的一来就是三十人、四十人，以个人计算住的特别多者，有的到一百次。到服务所来住的农民包括浙江、江西、安徽好几个省。
    其次，服务所还为农民准备了文娱等活动的便利条件，使农民到了服务所好似入了大学堂。该所订有皖南日报、解放日报，识字者可以自由阅读，不识字者由该所杨树藩主任及其他职员专门给农民讲解政策、读报纸听，每天还向农民公布物价行情。持有该所介绍信的农民，到电影院、剧院、洗澡池都是七折优待，到收茶站，可以尽先收买，价钱又比较合算。
    再就是该所认真替农民解决具体困难，使农民体会到服务所是真正替他们服务的。如歙县东乡老茶农丁忠贤，去年到屯溪带来了五斤茶叶没卖掉，急得要哭。该所看到此种情况，就按市价将他的茶叶收下了。丁忠贤被感动的说：“共产党真好呀！真与人民一条心，救了我的急！”
    就这样，吸引了一天比一天多的农民到服务所来。农民服务所的业务也一天比一天扩大。（皖南屯溪市小牛）
