　　Understanding the Issue of Not Touching Rich Peasants in Future Land Reform
    Ye Jixiu
    In his speech at the cadre meeting celebrating May Day in Beijing, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "In the context of the war having already achieved basic victory, we believe that in future land reform, only the land and many public lands of landlords should be confiscated and distributed to landless and land-poor peasants, while also giving landlords a share, and the land and property of rich peasants should not be touched. Regarding the other property of landlords, except for a portion of the means of production necessary for peasants, it will also not be confiscated and distributed."
    However, why "not touch the land and property of rich peasants?" Why "not confiscate and distribute the other property of landlords, except for a portion of the means of production necessary for peasants?" These questions have arisen in the minds of people across the country concerned about land reform, especially among general cadres. It is absolutely necessary for us to solve the understanding of the above issues in a timely and correct manner.
            I. The Key to the Decision Not to Touch
    For nearly 110 years, Chinese feudalism has been an ally of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, and the foundation of their rule. Therefore, the land reform to eliminate feudalism is the historical task and main content of China's new democratic revolution. There is no doubt that this task must be carried out resolutely and thoroughly. However, the steps and methods for completing this task should be subject to certain and necessary changes depending on the different and changing objective circumstances.
    Future land reform, generally speaking, refers to land reform in new areas in the future. The most fundamental difference between future land reform in new areas and past land reform in old areas is that the land reform in old areas was carried out in an environment of cruel war, when the outcome of the battle between us and the enemy was undecided; while future land reform in new areas will be carried out in a situation where the war has basically or will be completely won, and the country is shifting to peaceful economic construction on a national scale. In the past, during land reform, we touched the surplus land and property of rich peasants, not only touching the land of landlords and the means of production necessary for peasants, but also touching the other property of landlords (excluding industrial and commercial parts). This was completely necessary and possible under the conditions at that time. The reason why it was completely necessary was that our central task in the past was to strive for the victory of the revolutionary war; and the victory of the war was the supreme interest of the people of the whole country. At that time, the tasks of war and support for the front were above all else, and all work had to be subordinate to the needs of the war. At that time, the purpose of land reform, in addition to directly liberating rural productive forces and directly improving the lives of peasants, was also to mobilize the vast rural manpower and material resources to support the People's Liberation War. The reason why it was completely necessary was also because the revolutionary war had not yet achieved a basic victory, and the thoughts of landlords and rich peasants "hoping for Chiang Kai-shek" and their determination and actions to sabotage the revolutionary war and land reform had seriously become obstacles to the victorious development of the war. The reason why it was possible was because in the past, in general old liberated areas, rural feudal forces had been greatly weakened during decades of long-term war; and at that time, we had a sufficient number of powerful cadres and a relatively sufficient foundation of mass awareness and organization; in addition, the development of revolutionary victory was not as rapid as it later became, which gave us sufficient time to complete land reform in old areas, which were not very large, in stages and areas. Therefore, it was completely correct for the old areas to touch the rich peasants in the land reform and confiscate and distribute all the land and property of the landlords except for their industrial and commercial parts.
    However, the situation of land reform in new areas in the future is completely different from the past, and it is a new situation where the war has basically or will be completely won, the great unity of the people of the whole country has been formed politically and organizationally, and the country is shifting to peaceful economic construction on a national scale. What are the characteristics of this new situation and its requirements for land reform?
    First, in the context of the war having basically or will be completely won, the task of restoring and developing production as a way to consolidate this victory will be elevated to an overridingly important position. All our work in the future will be subordinate to and revolve around the central task of economic construction. Our basic starting point and basic purpose for considering all issues is to restore and develop the entire national economy. The People's Government has taken and will continue to take all necessary and effective policies and measures to strive for and grasp all possible favorable conditions to promote the accelerated recovery and development of the entire production. Considering and carrying out land reform in this new situation will have only one unique starting point and purpose, which is to liberate agricultural productive forces and create necessary conditions for the development of the entire social productive forces and national industrialization; the special needs of land reform for war have been eliminated. In this way, continuing to levy surplus land and property from rich peasants and confiscating and distributing the other property of landlords other than land and "a portion of the means of production necessary for peasants" in future land reform becomes unnecessary; on the contrary, in the new situation, not touching rich peasants and not touching the other property of landlords other than land and "a portion of the means of production necessary for peasants" is beneficial to production.
    Second, in the context of the war having basically or will be completely won, the most important contradiction in Chinese society will not be manifested as war, but will be manifested as land reform in vast new areas; changes in rural relations of production will appear particularly tense and prominent; the main attention of the people of the whole country will shift from war to land reform. Whether land reform can be carried out "completely, with leadership, prepared, and orderly" will directly and indirectly affect the stability of social order throughout the country and the progress of the entire production. In addition, today, we have not only achieved the basic victory of the war, but also established our own Central People's Government, and we have our own laws and judicial organs. Therefore, future land reform must be "complete" and "not allow the occurrence of chaotic phenomena." And "not touching the land and property of rich peasants" and not touching the other property of landlords other than land and "a portion of the means of production necessary for peasants" can guarantee that chaotic phenomena will not occur, guarantee the smoother completion of land reform that thoroughly eliminates the feudal system, facilitate the rapid stabilization of peasants' production emotions, and is conducive to the rapid recovery and development of production.
    Third, due to the victory of the revolutionary war, the great revolutionary unity of the people of the whole country has been formed politically and organizationally, prompting a change in the political inclination of rich peasants in vast new areas. In the past, the thoughts of landlords and rich peasants in the old areas "hoping for Chiang Kai-shek" and their determination to sabotage the revolution and land reform and sabotage the People's Government cannot but have changed among rich peasants in the new areas. This makes it possible for us to neutralize rich peasants in land reform. Furthermore, their possibility and material basis for continuing to develop towards feudalism—the feudal landlord land ownership system—will be thoroughly destroyed, which facilitates our thorough transformation of rich peasants after land reform.
    Next, in terms of the conditions for land reform: due to the rapid expansion of the victory of the revolutionary war, the entire mainland of China, except for Tibet, has been liberated; the successive liberation of Tibet and Taiwan is also not far off. However, there are still many Kuomintang bandits in some newly liberated areas waiting for us to wipe out; two-thirds of the country has not yet carried out land reform, and the large number of cadres needed to master policies and local conditions can be imagined; the vicious influence of the long-term rule of feudal, semi-feudal, and semi-colonial nature on the vast number of peasants cannot be completely eliminated in a short time. Of course, the victory of the revolution has also greatly encouraged the vast number of peasants in the new areas, and the rich experience of land reform in the old areas will also provide many conveniences for the new areas; however, to basically complete land reform in all areas in about three years, the three necessary conditions for preparation—environment, cadres, and mass base—especially the cadre condition, will still have differences in degree compared with the past old areas. However, land reform in the vast new areas cannot be postponed because of this; it has become an urgent requirement to quickly heal the wounds of war and restore and develop the people's economy. Therefore, more careful consideration must be given to land reform in the new areas in the future.
    Based on the above analysis of the basic situation and basic conditions of the new areas in the future, it is not difficult for us to recognize that the decision to "not touch the land and property of rich peasants" and "not confiscate and distribute" the "other property" of landlords other than land and "a portion of the means of production necessary for peasants" is completely correct and completely necessary for production.
            II. The Positive Role for Production
    Not touching the land and property of rich peasants, not touching the other property of landlords other than land and a portion of the means of production necessary for peasants, will have general and significant positive effects; in terms of its effect on the current recovery and development of production, this effect is even more significant.
    The significant role of not touching rich peasants lies first in that it can neutralize rich peasants, isolate landlords, guarantee the implementation of the basic principle of "relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants," and guarantee the successful completion of land reform in new areas. One of the decisive keys to whether land reform can be successfully completed is whether it can consolidate the unity of middle peasants. "The force that land reform relies on can only and must be poor peasants. This poor peasant class, together with hired peasants, accounts for about 70% of the rural population of China." "Land reform must unite with middle peasants, and poor and hired peasants must form a solid united front with middle peasants who account for about 20% of the rural population. Without doing this, poor and hired peasants will be isolated, and land reform will fail." (Chairman Mao, "Speech at the Cadre Meeting in Jin Sui"). In the process of successfully completing land reform in the old areas in the past, individual but also numerous deviations occurred in infringing on the interests of middle peasants, which brought no small difficulties to land reform work and the development of production after land reform. The main reason for this deviation was that in some rural areas, when dividing classes, people who were originally middle peasants were mistakenly classified as rich peasants. After stipulating that rich peasants should not be touched in future land reform, it will no longer be possible to mistakenly classify people who were originally middle peasants into the circle of rich peasants, so the phenomenon of wrongly struggling against middle peasants can be avoided, which is greatly beneficial to the development of production.
    Another significant meaning of not touching rich peasants is that it can dispel the ideological concerns of peasants about developing production after land reform. At present, in rural areas of the old areas, generally speaking, the production enthusiasm of peasants has been universally greatly improved after land reform, and a upsurge of restoring and developing production has been set off in the vast rural areas. However, in some individual areas, there are still many concerns in the minds of peasants: they are afraid of "standing out," afraid of "getting rich," and afraid of "society" (that is, afraid of the "agricultural socialism" they imagine). They are afraid of rising to become rich peasants; they do not know that the policy of the People's Government also allows and protects new-style rich peasants who develop after land reform. Peasants with this kind of ideological concern will not be very active in production; even if they can work hard on the one hand, they will eat and drink lavishly on the other hand and are unwilling to expand reproduction. However, because the existence of rich peasants is allowed in future land reform, as long as our policies can be correctly publicized and implemented, not only can this kind of ideological concern of peasants in the new areas in the future be completely prevented from happening, but also the existing ideological concerns of peasants in some old areas can be dispelled. In this way, agricultural production after land reform can be further improved, indirectly promoting the further development of the entire national economy.
    Determining not to confiscate and distribute those other properties of landlords other than land and a portion of the means of production necessary for peasants, on the one hand, it will not hinder the development of production, and on the other hand, it can reduce the occurrence of chaotic phenomena such as indiscriminate beating and killing, avoid causing a large waste and destruction of social wealth, and is conducive to the stability of social order and the progress of production. In the past, peasants in the old areas divided the landlords' "floating wealth" and dug up the landlords' "bottom wealth," which also had a certain positive effect at the time; but experience has proved that doing so would cause landlords to bury and disperse these properties and peasants to pursue these properties. Therefore, some phenomena of indiscriminate beating and killing will inevitably occur. Today, with the establishment of the Central People's Government and the imminent complete victory of the war, this phenomenon can no longer be allowed to continue. And if these properties are left to the landlords, the landlords can use them to maintain their lives or invest in production, which will also be beneficial to the recovery of production.
            III. Can the Requirements of Poor and Hired Peasants Be Met?
    Some people want to ask: Will this be able to meet the requirements of poor and hired peasants? To clearly answer this question, in addition to the above analysis of the basic situation, two other important differences between the general new areas and the old areas must be compared:
    First, before the implementation of land reform, compared with the old areas, the phenomenon of land being concentrated in the hands of a few landlords was more serious in the general new areas. Pre-war surveys have already pointed out this difference:
Area            Self-cultivating farmers    Semi-tenant farmers      Tenant farmers        Total Tenant and Semi-tenant Farmers
Northeast Provinces   51%                   19%                   30%                   49%
Yellow River Basin   69%                   18%                   13%                   31%
Yangtze River Basin  32%                   28%                   40%                   68%
Pearl River Basin
    Most of the farmers in the north are self-cultivating farmers, while the south is basically tenant farmers and semi-tenant farmers; in areas with fertile land, the proportion of tenant farmers is even greater, such as Chengdu and Xindu counties in Sichuan, where the proportion of tenant farmers reaches more than 70%, and in Baxian and Jiangbei counties in eastern Sichuan, it reaches 80%. The increase in tenant farmers is directly proportional to the concentration of land, and is also the result of land concentration. Many of the rich peasants in the south are tenant rich peasants or semi-tenant farmers, and much of the land they use is rented from landlords. In addition, many small and medium-sized landlords in the north often keep a large part of the land for their own management, while landlords of all sizes in the south rent out all or most of their land. This was the case before the war, so what is the trend since the Anti-Japanese War?
    As mentioned earlier, in general old areas, due to the longer liberation period and the experience of rent reduction and interest reduction, the power of landlords had been greatly weakened before land reform; from liberation to land reform, the change in rural land relations was not a continued concentration but a gradual decentralization trend. The new areas are different. Due to the long-term reactionary rule of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang before liberation, the idle funds of traitors, landlords, bureaucrats, and some merchants were still pursuing land, and the trend of continued concentration of land rights was very obvious. "Taking Sichuan as an example, from 1937 to 1941, the province's landlord real estate increased by 69% to 70%; in Xikang, it increased by 69% to 73%." Reflecting the continued concentration of land is the great increase in land rent: dividing the land between the landlord and the tenant is considered good, and in high cases, the landlord accounts for seven and the tenant accounts for three, the landlord accounts for eight and the tenant accounts for two, or even the landlord accounts for nine and the tenant accounts for one. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, famine occurred frequently in Chiang's district. In famine areas, land prices were as cheap as mud; in general, landlords used usury to merge land at this time. During this period, the trend of continued concentration of land may have been more obvious than in the past decades.
    Second, another difference between the general new areas and the past old areas is that there are particularly many public lands in the new areas. In addition to those public lands of the pseudo-government and "charitable organizations," there are also a large number of so-called school fields, temple fields, association fields, clan fields, and ancestral sacrifice fields (Taigong fields). Most of the rural areas in the southern provinces live in clans, and one of the main reasons why they can maintain this for so long is that there are a large number of public fields there. For example, in Yiwu County in Zhejiang Province, the item of clan fields alone reaches 200,000 mu, and in Jiangshan County in the province, clan fields account for 40% of the cultivated land; in Lanxi, the item of temple fields also reaches 24,000 mu. Suqian in northern Jiangsu has more than 200,000 mu of land occupied by temples. Anhui, which has fewer public lands, also has 636,987 mu. Public lands in Guangdong account for more than 35% of the province's cultivated land; among them, Taigong fields account for 30% of the cultivated land; Taigong fields in the sand areas of the province account for about 80% of the cultivated land. In other provinces in the Yangtze River Basin, there are many school fields.
    The owners of public lands—group landlords—not only carry out cruel land rent exploitation on peasants, but also carry out usury exploitation. In the fifth district of Maoming, Guangdong, 5% of the peasants borrow money to pay rent, and more than 80% of the income of Taigong fields in Huaxian is lent to peasants at high interest rates. When the principal and interest are not paid off, the only land property of the indebted peasants will be confiscated, and sometimes the method of "moving close to strangers" is often used to take the land property of the peasants' relatives to compensate for the insufficiency of the debt, and continue to merge and plunder land and property.
    From this, it can be seen that there are significant differences in land relations between the new and old areas; only confiscating and distributing the land of landlords and a portion of the means of production necessary for peasants, as well as many public lands, without touching the land and property of rich peasants, can generally meet the requirements of poor and hired peasants in the context of the imminent complete victory of the war. In addition, the state can use loan methods to help poor peasants solve their difficulties, and the defect that some peasants get less land can also be compensated. What's more, the basic purpose of land reform is not simply to relieve poor peasants; but to liberate rural productive forces from the shackles of the feudal ownership of the landlord class; so that peasants can obtain such conditions: that is, they can rely on their own hard work, implement mutual assistance and cooperation, and the help of the government to create their own happy life.
            IV. Conclusion
    Not touching rich peasants in future land reform is not temporary. That is to say, we only implement land reform once, and we will never implement land reform twice or more. If socialist land nationalization is also called some kind of "land reform," that is another matter; that is no longer a question of land distribution; that must be based on the conditions of national industrialization and the common requirements of the people of the whole country; that is also to further improve social productive forces and further improve the happy life of all working people; and that is also a matter of ten or twenty years later.
    Article 3 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "Step by step, the feudal and semi-feudal land ownership system will be changed into the peasant land ownership system, protecting the state's public property and the property of cooperatives, protecting the economic interests and private property of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie, developing the new democratic people's economy, and steadily changing the agricultural country into an industrial country." After land reform, not only the land and property of general former hired peasants, poor peasants, and middle peasants are protected by the People's Government, but also the same share of land obtained in land reform by people who were originally landlords and other properties that they were retained are also protected. Therefore, the land (including the retained rented land) and property owned by rich peasants are of course no problem and will be protected in the same way.
    However, as mentioned earlier, the historical task of anti-feudalism must undoubtedly be carried out resolutely and thoroughly. Allowing the existence of rich peasants does not mean allowing the continued existence of those semi-feudal super-economic exploitations of rich peasants; on the contrary, these semi-feudal exploitations will be continuously weakened and completely eliminated. The place where feudalism grows—the feudal landlord land ownership system—will be thoroughly destroyed. The people hold powerful political and economic power, enough to transform them; so that they turn to new-style rich peasant management or industrial and commercial development that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. Under the people's regime, this "feudal tail" will certainly be washed away by the economic wave of new democracy.
    Abstractly raising the question: "Is it good to touch rich peasants?" is difficult to answer. Well, why is it decided not to touch them in the future? It's not good, why did we touch them in the past? Touching rich peasants in the old areas in the past was completely correct; deciding not to touch rich peasants in the future is also completely correct. The important question is whether we can sufficiently recognize the different times, spaces, and conditions from which the two start.

　　对于今后土改不动富农问题的认识
    叶际秀
    刘少奇副主席在北京庆祝五一劳动节干部大会上的演说中指出：“在战争已经基本上胜利的情况下，我们认为在今后的土地改革中，应该只没收地主的土地和许多公地，分配给无地少地的农民，同时也分给地主一份，而不动富农的土地和财产。对于地主的其他财产，除开农民必需的一部分生产资料外，也不予没收分配。”
    但是，为什么“不动富农的土地和财产？”为什么“对于地主的其他财产，除开农民必需的一部分生产资料外，也不予没收分配”呢？这些问题，已经在我们全国关心土地改革的人民，特别在一般干部的思想上发生。及时而正确地解决对于上述问题的认识，对于我们，都是十分必要的。
            一、决定不动的关键
    近一百一十年来，中国的封建主义是帝国主义和官僚资本主义的同盟者及其统治的基础。因此，消灭封建主义的土地改革，乃是中国新民主主义革命的历史任务与主要内容。毫无疑义，这一任务是要坚决彻底完成的。但在完成这一任务的步骤与方法上，则应视客观情况之不同与变化而有一定的和必要的改变。
    今后的土改，一般而言，即指今后新区的土改。今后新区土改与过去老区一个最基本的不同情况，就是过去老区的土改是在残酷的战争的环境中，在我敌胜负未分的时候进行的；而今后新区的土改却将在战争已经基本上或将完全胜利、全国规模地转入和平的经济建设的情况下进行。过去我们在土地改革中动了富农的多余土地和财产，不但动了地主的土地和其为农民所必需的生产资料，而且也动了地主的其他（不包括工商业部分）财产，在那时的情况与条件下是完全必要和可能的。其所以完全必要，是因为过去我们的中心工作，是争取革命战争的胜利；而战争的胜利，则是全国人民的最高利益。在当时，战争与支前的任务高于一切，一切工作都必须服从战争的需要。那时土地改革的目的，除了直接解放农村生产力、直接改善农民生活以外，同时也在于动员广大农村的人力物力支持人民解放战争。其所以完全必要也由于过去革命战争尚未取得基本的胜利，地富“盼老蒋”的思想及其破坏革命战争和土地改革的决心与行动，曾严重成为战争胜利发展中的障碍。其所以可能，是由于过去一般老解放区，在十数年来的长期战争中，农村封建势力已被大大削弱了；而且那时，我们有充分数量的有力干部和比较足够的群众觉悟与组织基础；加上那时革命胜利的发展还没有后来那样迅速，便给我们以充分的时间来分期分区地完成区域不算很大的老区土改。所以过去老区在土改中动了富农，没收分配了地主除其工商业部分以外的一切土地和财产，是完全正确的。
    然而，今后新区土改的情况，却是与过去完全不同的情况，是战争已经基本上或将完全胜利结束、全国人民大团结已经在政治上和组织上形成、全国规模地转入和平的经济建设的新情况。这种新情况的特点及其对于土地改革的要求又是怎样呢？
    第一、在战争已经基本上或将完全胜利的情况下，作为巩固这个胜利的恢复与发展生产的任务，便将被提高到压倒一切的重要地位。今后我们的一切工作，必将服从于并围绕着经济建设这一中心任务而进行。我们考虑一切问题的基本出发点与基本目的，在于恢复与发展整个国民经济。人民政府已经并将继续采取一切必要而有效的政策措施，争取并掌握一切可能的有利条件，促使整个生产之加速恢复与发展。在这种新的情况下考虑与进行土地改革，将只有一个唯一的出发点与目的，就是解放农业生产力，为发展整个社会生产力及国家工业化创造必要的条件；土改对于战争的特殊需要已被免除了。这样，便使在今后土改中继续征收富农的多余土地和财产、没收分配地主那些除开土地及其为“农民必需的一部分生产资料”以外的其他财产，成为没有必要的了；相反，在新的情况下，不动富农，不动地主的那些除了土地和“农民必需的一部分生产资料”以外的其他财产，是于生产有利的。
    第二、在战争已经基本上或将完全胜利的情况下，中国社会之最主要矛盾，将不表现为战争，而将表现为广大新区的土地改革；农村生产关系的变化，将显得特别紧张与突出；全国人民的主要注意力将自战争移向土改。土地改革之是否能够“完全有领导的，有准备的，有秩序的”进行，将可直接间接影响全国社会秩序之安定与整个生产之进行。加以今天，我们不但已经取得战争的基本胜利，并早已成立了自己的中央人民政府，我们已有自己的法律与司法机关。因此便要求今后的土地改革，必须是“完全”“不能容许混乱现象的发生”。而“不动富农的土地和财产”和不动地主除开土地与“农民必需的一部分生产资料”以外的其他财产，能够保证混乱现象之不致发生，保证彻底消灭封建制度的土地改革之更顺利的完成，便于迅速稳定农民的生产情绪，有利于生产之迅速恢复与发展。
    第三、由于革命战争的胜利，全国人民的革命大团结已经在政治上和组织上形成，促使广大新区的富农，在政治倾向上发生改变。以前老区地富“盼老蒋”的思想及其破坏革命与土改，破坏人民政府的决心，在新区富农中，已不能不有改变。这样就使得我们在土改中中立富农成为可能。再说，他们继续向封建主义发展的可能性与物质基础——封建地主土地所有制，将被彻底地摧毁，这样就便利于我们对于富农在土改之后加以彻底的改造。
    次就土改的条件而言：由于革命战争的胜利迅速扩大，全国大陆除西藏外，全部解放；西藏台湾的相继解放也已为期不远了。但是，若干新解放地区尚有许多国民党土匪待我们去肃清；全国有三分之二的地区尚未进行土地改革，所需能掌握政策及当地情况的干部数量之大，可以想见；封建、半封建及半殖民地性的长期统治所给与广大农民的恶毒影响，短时间内亦虽完全消除。固然，革命的胜利也曾大大鼓舞了广大新区的农民，老区土改的丰富经验也将给新区以不少便利；但，欲在三年左右的时间内，基本上完成一切地区的土地改革，则环境、干部、群众基础等三个必要的准备条件——特别是干部条件，与过去老区比较起来，仍必将有程度上的差别。然而，广大新区的土地改革却不能因此而推迟进行，它已成为迅速医治战争创伤，恢复与发展人民经济的迫不可缓的要求了。所以，对于今后新区的土改，就不可不作更慎重的考虑。
    基于上述对今后新区基本情况与基本条件的分析，我们不难认识，决定“不动富农的土地和财产”，“不予没收分配”地主除开土地与“农民必需的一部分生产资料”以外的“其他财产”，是完全正确的，在生产上是完全必要的。
            二、对于生产的积极作用
    不动富农的土地和财产，不动地主的那些除土地和为农民所必需的一部分生产资料以外的其他财产，将有一般的重大的积极作用；就其对目前恢复与发展生产而言，这种作用更为显著。
    不动富农的重大作用，首先在于它可以中立富农，孤立地主，保证“依靠贫农，团结中农”的基本原则之贯彻，保证新区土地改革之胜利完成。土地改革之能否胜利完成，其决定的关键之一，在于能否巩固地团结中农。“土地改革所依靠的力量，只能和必须是贫农。这个贫农阶层，和雇农在一起，占了中国农村人口的百分之七十左右。”“土地改革必须团结中农，贫雇农必须和占农村人口百分之二十左右的中农结成巩固的统一战线。不这样做，贫雇农就会陷于孤立，土地改革就会失败。”（毛主席“在晋绥干部会议上的讲话”）。过去老区在胜利完成土改的过程中，曾发生过个别的但也是不少的侵犯中农利益的偏差，给土改工作及土改以后发展生产带来了不小的困难。产生这种偏差的主要原因，在于部分农村在划分阶级的时候，错误地将原为中农成份的人划为富农。在今后土地改革中规定不动富农之后，就再不致于把原为中农成份的人误划分到富农的圈子里去了，因而就可避免错斗中农现象之发生，大大有利于生产之发展。
    不动富农在另一方面的重大意义，是可以解除农民在土改后对发展生产的思想顾虑。目前老区的农村，一般而言，土改后农民的生产积极性已经普遍大大提高了，广大农村已掀起了恢复与发展生产的热潮。但在若干个别地区，农民思想上还存在着不少的顾虑：他们怕“冒尖”，怕“致富”，怕“社会”（即害怕他们所想象的“农业社会主义”）他们害怕要上升而为富农；他们不知道人民政府的政策，对土改后发展起来的新式富农，也是被允许与保护的。有这种思想顾虑的农民，对生产不会是很积极的；即使一方面能努力生产，另一方面却大吃大喝，不愿扩大再生产。但由于在今后土改中允许富农的存在，只要我们的政策能够得到正确的宣传与贯彻，则不但今后新区农民的这种思想顾虑可以完全不致于发生，且可解除部分老区的农民现存的思想顾虑。这样就可使土改后农业生产得到进一步的提高，间接促使整个国民经济之进一步发展。
    确定不予没收分配地主除土地和农民所必需的一部生产资料以外的那些其他财产，一方面它不致妨碍生产的发展，而另一方面，可以减免乱打乱杀等混乱现象之发生，避免引起社会财富之大量浪费和破坏，有利于社会秩序之安定与生产之进行。过去老区农民分了地主的“浮财”，挖了地主的“底财”，虽然在当时也有一定的积极作用；但经验证明，那样做就会引起地主对于这些财产的埋藏分散和农民对于这些财产的追索。因此必然会发生若干乱打乱杀的现象。在今天中央人民政府已经成立，战争即将完全胜利的情况下，这种现象更不能容许继续发生。而如果把这些财产留给地主，则地主可借以维持生活或投资于生产，亦将于生产恢复有所补益。
            三、能够满足贫雇农的要求吗
    有人要问：这样一来，是否能满足贫雇农的要求？要明确答复这一问题，除上述基本情况的分析外，还必须将一般新区与老区之另外两个重要不同，作一比较：
    第一，在未实行土改以前，一般新区与老区比较，新区土地集中在少数地主手里的现象更为严重。战前的调查已可指明此种不同：地域 
       自耕农        半佃农      佃农        佃农与半佃农合计东北各省    五一％        一九％      三○％      四九％黄河流域    六九％        一八％      一三％      三一％长江流域    三二％        二八％      四○％      六八％珠江流域
    北方农户大半为自耕农，而南方则基本上是佃农与半佃农；土地肥沃的地区，佃农比数更大，如四川成都、新都等县，佃农比数均达百分之七十以上，川东巴县、江北等县则达百分之八十。佃农增加是与土地集中成正比，也是土地集中的结果。南方富农中很多是佃富农或半佃农，其使用的很多土地是从地主手里租来的。此外，北方许多中小地主，往往留一大部土地自己经营，而南方大小地主则均将其全部或绝大部分土地出租。战前如此，抗战以来的趋势又怎样呢？
    如前所述，一般老区由于解放较久，又经过了减租减息，土改前地主势力已被大大削弱了；从解放到土改，农村土地关系的变化，已不是继续集中而是逐渐分散的趋势。新区则不然，由于解放以前日本帝国主义和国民党的长期反动统治，汉奸、地主、官僚与部分商人的游资仍在追逐土地，地权曾继续集中的趋势是很显然的。“以四川为例，在一九三七年到一九四一年，该省地主地产增加百分之六十九至七十；在西康则增加了百分之六十九到七十三”。与土地继续集中相反映的，是地租数目的大大加多：主佃对分还算是好的，高的有达主七佃三，主八佃二乃至主九佃一的。抗战结束后，蒋区灾荒频仍。在灾荒地区，地价贱如泥；一般地主曾在这时通过高利贷方式兼并土地。这一时期，土地继续集中的趋势恐较过去数十年来更为明显。
    第二，一般新区与过去老区之另一不同之处，即在于新区的公地特别的多。除伪政府及“慈善机关”的那些公地以外，还有大批的所谓学田、庙田、会田、族田和祭田（太公田）。南方各省农村大部是聚族而居的，其所以能如此长期维持，主要原因之一，就是那里存在着大批的公田。如浙江义乌一县单族田一项即达二十万亩，该省江山一县族田竟占耕地百分之四十；兰溪庙田一项亦达二万四千亩。苏北宿迁有二十万亩以上的寺庙占有地。公地较少的安徽亦有六十三万六千九百八十七亩。广东公地，竟占全省耕地百分之三十五以上；其中太公田即占耕地的百分之三十；全省沙区太公田则约要占到耕地的百分之八十。长江流域其他各省则学田极多。
    公地所有者——集团地主——对于农民除残酷的地租剥削外，且亦进行其高利贷剥削。广东茂名第五区农民就有百分之五是借钱还租的，花县太公田收入的百分之八十以上，均以高利借给农民。当本利还不清时，负债农民的仅有土地财产就要被没收，有时还往往用“移亲近疏”的办法将农民亲属的土地财产拿去抵补偿债之不足，实行其继续兼并掠夺土地和财产。
    由此可知，新区与老区在土地关系上有显著差异；只没收分配地主的土地及其为农民必需的一部分生产资料以及许多公地，而不动富农的土地和财产，在战争即将完全胜利的情况下，一般是能够满足贫雇农的要求的。加上，国家已可以用贷款的方法去帮助贫苦农民解决困难，部分农民少得一部分土地的缺陷，也能得到补偿。更何况，土地改革的基本目的，不是单纯地为了救济贫苦农民；而是为了要使农村生产力从地主阶级封建所有制的束缚之下获得解放；使农民获得了这样的条件：即能够依靠自己的努力劳动，实行互助合作和政府的帮助来创造自己的幸福生活。
            四、结语
    今后土改不动富农，不是暂时的。就是说，我们只实行一次的土地改革，而决不会实行两次或两次以上的土地改革。如果把社会主义的土地国有化，也叫做什么“土地改革”，那是另外一回事；那不再是分配土地的问题了；那是必须根据国家工业化的条件与全国人民的共同要求的；那也是为了更进一步地提高社会生产力，更进一步地提高全体劳动人民的美满生活；而且那也是十年二十年长期以后的事情。
    人民政协共同纲领第三条中规定。“有步骤地将封建半封建的土地所有制改变为农民的土地所有制，保护国家的公共财产和合作社的财产，保护工人、农民、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的经济利益及其私有财产，发展新民主主义的人民经济，稳步地变农业国为工业国。”土地改革之后，不但一般原为雇农、贫农、中农的所有土地财产受到人民政府的保护，就是原为地主的人在土改中所分得同样一份的土地及其所被保留的其他财产，也是受到保护的。因此，富农所有的土地（包括被保留的出租地在内）和财产，当然是没有问题的，也会受到同样的保护。
    但是，如前所述，反封建的历史任务毫无疑地是要坚决彻底完成的。允许富农的存在，并不等于说允许富农的那些半封建性的超经济剥削继续存在；相反，这些半封建性的剥削是将被不断削弱以至彻底肃清的。封建主义所借以生长的地盘——封建地主土地所有制，即将被彻底地摧毁。人民手里已握有强大的政治与经济力量，足以改造他们；使他们转向新式富农经营或有利于国计民生的工商业发展。在人民的政权下，这条“封建尾巴”将一定会为新民主主义的经济浪潮所冲掉。
    抽象的这样提出问题：“动了富农好不好？”是很难回答的。好吧，为什么今后决定不动呢？不好吧，为什么过去又动了？过去老区动了富农是完全正确的；今后决定不动富农也是完全正确的。重要的问题在乎我们能否足够认识二者所由出发的不同时间、空间与条件。
