　　Xinhua News Agency, 25th—The All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council issued an appeal on the 6th to workers worldwide united within the World Federation of Trade Unions, demanding that workers worldwide launch a protest movement to rescue the eight Japanese workers, youths, and patriotic students who were illegally sentenced to long-term hard labor by the U.S. military tribunal on June 3rd. The appeal is summarized as follows:

　　Dear Comrades:

　　Eight patriotic workers, youths, and students have been sentenced to long-term hard labor under fabricated charges.

　　On May 30th, the Democratic National Front held a mass rally in Tokyo's People's Square (i.e., the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace). The purpose of the rally was to oppose war and demand the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Two of the eight patriots are trade union members and members of the Trade Union Liaison Council, namely Onishi, a member of the News Professionals Union, and Sodeyama, a member of the Metal Workers Union. The eight patriots were arrested for allegedly using violence against officers and soldiers of the U.S. occupation forces and were therefore tried by a military tribunal. On June 3rd, the U.S. occupation forces' military tribunal, without any conclusive evidence, sentenced them to long-term hard labor.

　　This arbitrary judgment is one of the various means of persecution against the national movement launched by democratic forces to strive for peace and independence.

　　We hereby appeal to workers worldwide to launch a protest movement on an international scale to rescue the eight patriots.

　　日劳联呼吁援救爱国者
    要求全世界工人展开抗议运动  反对美国军事法庭的专横裁判
    【新华社二十五日讯】全日本工会联络协议会于六日发表致团结在世界工会联合会之内的全世界工人呼吁书，要求全世界工人展开抗议运动，援救被美国军事法庭于六月三日非法判处长期苦役的八位日本工人、青年和爱国学生。呼吁书摘要如下：亲爱的同志们：
    八位爱国的工人、青年和学生，在捏造的罪名下被判处了长期苦役。
    五月三十日由民主民族阵线主持在东京人民广场（按即皇宫前广场）上召开了一个群众大会。大会的宗旨是反对战争，要求依照波茨坦协定签订全面和约。八位爱国者中有两个是工会会员和工会联络协议会会员，他们是新闻职业者工会会员大西和五金工会会员袖山。八位爱国者被捕的原因是被指为对美国占领军的官兵施用了暴力，所以要受军事法庭裁判。六月三日，美国占领军的军事法庭没有任何确凿证据，便将他们判处了长期苦役。
    这个专横裁判，是对于民主力量为争取和平独立所发动的民族运动的各种迫害手段之一。
    我们谨向全世界的工人呼吁，在国际范围内，为援救八位爱国者而展开一个抗议运动。
