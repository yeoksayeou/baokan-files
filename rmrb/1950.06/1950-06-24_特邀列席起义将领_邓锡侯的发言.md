Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd:

　　Speech by uprising General Deng Xihou at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The text is as follows:

　　Chairman Mao, fellow committee members, and gentlemen:

　　I feel infinitely excited and honored to be invited to attend the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　Since the opening of the conference, after hearing Chairman Mao's instructions, and hearing the reports from Vice Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, and other central leaders, I deeply realized that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have truly stood up today, and the Chinese revolution has truly achieved victory!

　　The Central People's Government has only been established for eight months, and it has already unified the national finances, stabilized prices, and improved the lives of people in land reform areas. This is something that the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek failed to do for many years. This also illustrates the difference between Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government and today's People's Government.

　　Of course, we also understand that there are still major tasks of the Chinese revolution that have not been completed. This even more important task is to carry out comprehensive, thorough, planned, and step-by-step land reform, closely following the overall military victory.

　　Vice Chairman Liu has clearly instructed in his land reform report that without thoroughly implementing land reform, "the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution cannot be consolidated, the rural productive forces cannot be liberated, the industrialization of New China will be impossible, and the people cannot obtain the basic fruits of revolutionary victory." To implement land reform, it is necessary to thoroughly "abolish the feudal exploitation of land ownership by the landlord class and implement the system of peasant land ownership."

　　Such a reform of the land system, I can frankly say personally, conflicts with the class interests of myself and my class (the landlord class). However, today I want to express to everyone, and to the Chinese people, with great excitement, that I am willing to sincerely support such a land reform. I will resolutely abandon the interests of my class in order to obey the interests of the people of the whole country, and to obey the interests of the entire revolution. I feel that only when everyone has interests can I have interests. I understand the truth that "small interests must give way to large interests." Therefore, I have no nostalgia and no worries, and I am sincerely willing to do so. Therefore, I am determined to not only achieve "uprising" in the military sense, but also to achieve "uprising" in the class sense.

　　I am ashamed that I have done very little for the Chinese people's revolution in the past, and for the past one or two decades under Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, I have completely acted as his henchman. I am truly sorry to the people of Sichuan and the whole country.

　　Today, under the call of Chairman Mao, I have realized this. I will sincerely stand on the side of the Chinese people, obey the leadership of the government and Chairman Mao, serve the people, and do my best for the revolution. Especially in completing the task of land reform, I will do everything I can to contribute my share of strength.

　　I heard Vice Chairman Liu's report that "land occupied by landlords in Sichuan accounts for about 80 percent." This shows that land reform in Sichuan is more important than in other provinces. Precisely because of this situation, the landlord class in Sichuan must be more actively prepared for ideological transformation. But I believe that under the correct policies of the Central Government, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the landlord class in Sichuan will gradually awaken, support land reform, transform themselves through labor, and become new people in the new China!

　　Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to make a request to the Central Government. Sichuan is a newly liberated area, and it was also the area that Chiang Kai-shek once vainly hoped to use as his last struggle on the mainland. Although his dreams were finally shattered, Sichuan, after supporting the War of Resistance Against Japan for eight years, and then being subjected to Chiang Kai-shek's cruel suppression and plundering, has had its people greatly exhausted. Now that the people have been liberated, their vitality still needs to be restored. However, given the importance of the Sichuan area and the richness of Sichuan's material foundation, Sichuan should occupy an important position in the economic construction and national defense construction of New China in the future. Therefore, regarding Sichuan's economic, transportation, and various construction undertakings, I hope that the Central Government will provide strong assistance under possible conditions.

　　I am willing to stand "under the banner of Mao Zedong" and follow behind you all, working together for the construction of a new democratic nation!

### 特邀列席起义将领  邓锡侯的发言

　　特邀列席起义将领
    邓锡侯的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】起义将领邓锡侯在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言。文如下：毛主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    这次我被邀列席中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第二次会议，我是感到无限的兴奋和光荣。
    大会开幕以来，我听到毛主席的指示，听到刘副主席、周总理、以及中央各位首长的报告，我是深切的认识了：在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，今天，全中国人民才真正是翻身了，中国革命才真正是得到了胜利！
    中央人民政府成立才只有八个月，就使全国财政统一起来，物价有了稳定，土改地区人民的生活有了改善，这是蒋介石反动政府多年来未做到的。这也就说明了蒋介石反动政府与今天人民政府是怎样的不同了。
    当然，我们也了解，今天中国革命还有重大的任务没有完成，这个更重大的任务，就是要紧随着全面的军事胜利之后，来进行全面的、彻底的、有计划的、有步骤的土地改革。
    刘副主席在土改报告中，已指示得很清楚，不彻底实行土改，“中国人民革命的胜利就不能巩固，农村生产力就不能解放，新中国的工业化就没有实现的可能，人民就不能得到革命胜利的基本的果实”。要实行土改，就必须彻底的“废除地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制，实行农民的土地所有制”。
    这样一个土地制度的改革，在我个人，我可以很坦白的说，是我和本阶级（地主阶级）的阶级利益相冲突的。但是，我今天要以万分兴奋的心情向大家表示，向中国人民表示，我愿诚挚的拥护这样的一个土地改革，我要坚决的放弃本阶级的利益，来服从全国人民的利益，服从整个革命的利益。我觉得是大家有了利益，自己才会有利益，我是了解了“小利益服从大利益”这条真理。所以我无所留恋，无所顾惜，真真实实的愿意这样做。因此，我抱定决心，不仅做到军事上的“起义”，而且更要做到阶级上的“起义”。
    我很惭愧我过去很少为中国人民革命尽过力，而且在蒋介石反动统治下一二十年来我完全做了他的帮手，实在对不起四川和全国的人民。
    今天在毛主席的感召下，我觉悟到这一点，我将诚心诚意站到中国人民方面，服从政府及毛主席的领导，为人民服务，为革命尽力，尤其在完成土地改革任务中，我将竭尽我所能尽的一分力量。
    我听到刘副主席的报告，“四川地主占有的土地约占百分之八十”，这说明四川土改是比其他省份更带有重要性的，也正因这种情形，四川的地主阶级是要在思想上更要做积极的改造准备的；但我相信，在中央政府正确的政策执行之下，在毛主席的领导之下，四川的地主阶级都会逐渐的觉悟过来，拥护土地改革，从劳动中来改造自己，在新的中国做一个新人！
    最后，我想借这个机会，向中央提一个要求，四川是新解放的地区，也是蒋介石曾经妄想作为在大陆上最后挣扎的地区，虽然他的梦想终被打碎，但四川这个地区，由于经过八年支撑抗日战争，在胜利后又受到蒋介石的残酷镇压和搜刮，民力耗竭已甚，现在人民虽得到解放，而元气则尚待恢复。然以四川地区的重要及四川物质基础的丰富，今后，无论在新中国的经济建设上，在国防建设上，四川都应该占重要的位置。因此，关于四川在经济、交通及各种建设事业上，希望中央在可能的条件下，予以大力的帮助。
    我愿站在“毛泽东的旗帜下”，追随在诸位之后，共同为新民主主义的国家建设而努力！
