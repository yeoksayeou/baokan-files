This article is a section from the paper "Improving the Party's Leadership over Local Newspapers" by Strepetov and Pikasov, originally published in the "Bolshevik" magazine, issue number six (March).

Our newspapers, as tools of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, play an outstanding role. In exposing all the shortcomings in our work, in exposing the bureaucratic tendencies of individual organizations and agencies, there is no more mass-oriented platform than newspapers, no other more effective means. For the sake of a further upsurge in the economy and culture, for the sake of further consolidating Party organizations, it is very important to use newspapers to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and it is a top priority task of Party leadership. In the hands of the Party Committee, the newspaper should not be a passive recorder of events, but a fighting mass organizer, not complacent with achievements, not self-satisfied with honors, mobilizing the masses to work selflessly, to expose and discover those endless potentials and possibilities that accelerate our progress.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has repeatedly emphasized the significance of sharp, militant, and principled criticism in our newspapers. In the resolution "On Measures to Improve the Local Newspapers 'Railway Worker' (Rostov), 'Volga Commune' (Kuibyshev City), and 'Kursk Truth'," the Central Committee pointed out that "newspapers should... organize Bolshevik criticism of the shortcomings in the work of Party, Soviet, trade union, and economic organizations, pointing out the ways to overcome difficulties in solving economic and political tasks."

The content of criticism is by no means limited to making individual criticisms to a certain organization, which is unfortunately a characteristic of many of our newspapers. As Comrade Stalin taught, we must proceed from individual criticisms to make deeper criticisms, and then from deep criticisms to summarize the results of criticism, and discover what achievements the results of criticism have brought to our construction. Raising the level of criticism in our newspapers, improving the effectiveness of criticism, and increasing the impact of criticism on the progress of economic and cultural construction and on Party life – this is the responsibility of Party leadership.

Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism are creative. It aims to improve the work of the criticized agency or organization. Criticism in newspapers should be able to educate our cadres, improve their efforts and energy, and educate them with correct Bolshevik working methods. Newspapers that can make realistic criticisms are always able to raise many meaningful questions from the criticisms, and are able to show untapped potentials and means to eliminate shortcomings and improve work.

Our newspapers are inextricably linked to the people and enjoy well-deserved prestige among the broad masses. The Soviet people are active participants in the construction of a new life. Every negligence, every shortcoming in the work of this or that organization is seen by them as a damage to the common cause, as an obstacle to further development. The laborers use criticism and self-criticism to help eliminate shortcomings and improve work. Thousands of letters are sent to newspaper editorial offices every day, raising various questions. Representatives of workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals report on the achievements in various sectors of socialist construction, share their experiences, ask for advice, and so on. Critical communications that expose the shortcomings in the work of Party, Soviet, economic, and other organizations occupy a particularly important place in readers' letters. We must strive to take timely measures based on the letters from the laborers to analyze and summarize the calls from all over the country. The Party Committee should systematically care about the readers' letters.

It is intolerable to despise the letters from the laborers. Taking a bureaucratic attitude towards the calls of the Soviet people will disconnect the newspaper from the readers and from life, and will shelve the criticisms from below. Obviously, the editorial departments of individual newspapers have not fully realized this. "Red Bashkiria Newspaper" ignored the most serious violations of state discipline and abuses of power in some republic organizations, and bureaucratically treated the calls about the shortcomings in the work of these organizations. For example, the editorial department did not pay attention to the manuscripts that seriously criticized the work of the Education Department of the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the Belokatay District Party Committee. The editorial department indifferently and bureaucratically treated the calls about the abuse of power by individual staff members of the Supreme Court of the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Instead of carefully studying these manuscripts and conducting necessary checks, the editorial department sent the received letters to the people accused by the letter writers. In this way, honest and principled criticism was suppressed from the very beginning. And those who seriously violated Soviet laws were not punished for a long time. In individual cases, the Bashkir Provincial Party Committee staff's guidance to the newspaper was incorrect. They forbade the editorial department from publishing the letter from Comrade Sustov, a driver of the Sterlitamak Locomotive Factory, accusing Comrade Andrianenko, the director of the factory, of rudely suppressing criticism. Under their insistence, a skit exposing the improper behavior of Comrade Osipov, the chairman of the management committee of the Bashkir Production Cooperative, was also not published.

Criticism in newspapers should be militant, sharp, and principled. Fearing to point out the specific names of those who make mistakes, and unwilling to criticize without considering face, will make criticism in newspapers weak and abstract. The call and desire to launch criticism are issued from the newspaper, but the published articles are "smooth," weak, and indifferent. If articles with specific names and facts of criticism do appear in these newspapers, then check whether they are written according to the materials of the provincial organization and the resolutions it has passed. However, the newspaper has a mission to help the Party organization in exposing shortcomings, and should not follow behind the events. If the "Chelyabinsk Worker Newspaper" publishes hardly any serious critical articles and short messages, then what kind of help can the Party provincial organization get from this newspaper? The editor-in-chief of this newspaper, Comrade Konstantinovskii, often embellishes criticism. He is afraid of damaging relations with the leaders of the provincial organization, he flatteringly deletes the places criticizing the leaders in the manuscripts, and in many cases, he completely prevents the publication of correct critical manuscripts. Obviously, such a newspaper does not receive the respect it deserves from the readers, and is not a fighting helper of the Party organization.

The major shortcomings of the "Chelyabinsk Worker Newspaper" and some other newspapers in launching criticism and self-criticism are primarily because the provincial Party Committee does not lead the newspaper satisfactorily, does not guide the newspaper to bravely launch criticism, and does not regularly and actively support critical remarks. Individual provincial Party Committees sometimes attempt to suppress criticism. The Molotov Provincial Party Committee recently treated its own newspaper in this way. The provincial Party Committee did not support the correct critical remarks of the newspaper, and sometimes the provincial Party Committee staff even forbade the publication of critical manuscripts. The provincial Party Committee once privately stipulated incorrect practices, according to which the critical manuscripts sent to the editorial department were "corrected" and "ironed out," which deprived the newspaper of its initiative and reduced the sharpness of its remarks.

It is very obvious that this practice cannot help the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and Party organizations, reduces the sharpness and principles of newspapers, and turns newspapers into unmotivated and dull entities. Whoever suppresses and oppresses criticism and self-criticism is killing any autonomy of the Party organization, undermining the prestige of the leading organs among the Party members and the masses, and affirming the anti-Party habits of the Party's deadly enemies—bureaucrats—in the life of the Party organization.

Comrade Stalin taught: "When we do not openly and honestly point out and expose the shortcomings and errors in our work as Bolsheviks should, we cut off our path forward. However, we want to move forward. Precisely because we want to move forward, we should put forward honest and revolutionary self-criticism as one of our most important tasks. Without this, there is no progress. Without this, there is no development." (Complete Works of Stalin, Volume 10, page 331). Therefore, any suppression of criticism, any even the smallest bureaucratic attitude towards critical opinions should be regarded as an action against our common cause, as an obstacle to the further development of our country towards the road of communism.

The Party Committee must demand brave, principled, and profound criticism from the newspaper, should support the critical remarks of the newspaper, help the newspaper to make the published manuscripts effective, and resolutely fight against all manifestations of taking a bureaucratic attitude towards the criticism published in the newspaper.

### 论地方报纸的批评和自我批评

　　论地方报纸的批评和自我批评
    本文系斯特列普霍夫和皮卡索夫的论文“改进党对地方报纸的领导”中的一节，原载“布尔什维克”杂志第六期（三月号）
    我们的报纸，作为布尔什维克的批评自我批评的工具，起着卓越的作用。在揭发我们工作中所有的缺点上，在揭发个别组织和机关的活动的官僚主义偏向上，没有比报纸更群众化的讲坛，没有别的更有效的手段。为了经济和文化的更进一步高涨起见，为了党的组织更进一步巩固起见，运用报纸来展开批评自我批评，这是非常重要的事情，而且是党的领导的头等任务。报纸在党委手里，应当不是被动的事件记录器，应当是战斗性的群众组织者，它不以成就自满，不以荣誉自慰，动员群众去忘我地劳动，去揭露和发现那些加速我们前进的源源不断的潜力和可能性。
    联共中央委员会一再着重指出了我们报纸上的尖锐的、战斗性的、原则性的批评的意义。在“关于改进地方报纸‘铁道报’（罗斯托夫）、‘伏尔加公社报’（古比雪夫城）和‘库尔斯克真理报’的办法”的决议中，联共中央指出了“报纸应当……对党的、苏维埃的、职工会的和经济的组织的工作缺点，组织布尔什维克的批评，指出在解决经济任务和政治任务中克服困难的道路。”
    批评的内容，完全不尽在于向某某组织提出个别的批评意见，很遗憾，我们的许多报纸带着这个特点。正如斯大林同志所教导的，必须从个别的批评意见进而作更深刻的批评，再从深刻的批评进而总结批评的结果，发现批评的结果在我们的建设方面得到了什么成绩。提高我们报纸上的批评水平，提高批评的效果，提高批评对于经济建设和文化建设的进度的影响，对于党内生活的影响，——这是党的领导的责任。
    布尔什维克的批评和自我批评是具有创造性的。它是以改进受批评的机关或组织的工作为目的的。报纸上的批评应当能教育我们的干部，提高他们的努力和精力，以正确的布尔什维克的工作方法教育他们。会作实事求是的批评的报纸，总是能够从批评中提出许多有意义的问题，能够显示未曾使用过的潜力和手段来消除缺点、改进工作。
    我们的报纸，千丝万缕地跟人民联系着，并且在广大群众中享有应得的威信。苏联埃人们是新生活建设的积极参加者。在这个或那个组织的工作中的每一个疏忽、每一个缺点，都被他们看做是对共同事业的损害，看做是进一步发展的障碍。劳动者用批评和自我批评，来帮助消除缺点、改进工作。每天都有成千的信寄到报纸编辑部，信里提出了各种各样的问题。工人、集体农庄庄员和知识分子的代表报告在社会主义建设各部门达到的成绩，诉说自己的经验，请教，等等。在读者来信中，揭发党的、苏维埃的、经济的和其他的组织的工作缺点的批评性通讯，占特别重要的地位。必须争取做到根据劳动者的来信，及时采取办法来分析和总结来自各地的呼声。党委应当有系统地关切读者的来信。
    轻视劳动者的来信，是不可容忍的。对于苏维埃人们的呼声采取官僚主义态度，会使报纸跟读者、跟生活脱节，会把下层来的批评束之高阁。显然，个别报纸的编辑部还是没有完全认识到这一点。“红巴什吉利亚报”忽视了某些共和国组织中最严重地违反国家纪律和滥用职权的行为，官僚主义地对待关于这些组织的工作的缺点的呼声。例如，编辑部对于严重批评巴什吉尔自治共和国教育部和别洛卡泰区党委工作的稿件，并没有加以注意。编辑部冷淡地、官僚主义地对待关于巴什吉尔自治共和国最高法院个别工作人员滥用职权的呼声。编辑部不去细心研究这种稿件，对它们进行必要的检查，而把收到的信件寄给来信者所控诉的人。这样，一开始就抑制了正直的、原则的批评。而严重地违反苏维埃法律的人，长期没有受到处分。在个别情况下，巴什基尔省党委工作人员对于报纸的指导是不正确的。他们禁止编辑部发表斯特尔立达马卡斯基火车厂司机苏斯托夫同志控诉车厂主任安得连柯同志对于批评的粗暴压制行为的来信。在他们的坚持下，一篇揭露巴什吉尔生产合作社管理委员会主席奥西波夫同志的不正确行为的小品文，也没有发表。
    报纸上的批评，应当是战斗性的、尖锐的、原则性的。害怕指出犯错误者的具体姓名，不愿意不顾面子地批评，将使报纸上的批评成为无力的、抽象的。从报纸上发出展开批评的号召和愿望，而登出的文章是“圆滑的”、软弱的、冷淡的。如果在这些报纸上也会出现有具体姓名和事实的批评文章的话，那么检查一下，它是按照省组织的材料及其所通过的决议写的。但是，报纸负有使命在揭发缺点上帮助党的组织，而不应该跟在事件的尾巴后面。如果“车里雅宾斯克工人报”几乎不登刊严重的批评文章和短讯，那么党的省组织可以从该报得到什么样的帮助呢？这个报纸的主编康士坦丁诺夫斯基同志常常粉饰批评。他害怕弄坏跟省组织的领导者的关系，他逢迎地删掉稿件中批评领导者的地方，而且有许多场合，完全阻止正确的批评稿件的发表。显然，这样的报纸受不到读者应有的敬重，而且不是党的组织的战斗的助手。
    “车里雅宾斯克工人报”和另外一些报纸在展开批评和自我批评上的大缺点，首先是因为省党委不能令人满意地领导着报纸，不指导报纸去勇敢地展开批评，不经常积极地支持批评的言论。个别的省党委有时企图压制批评。莫洛托夫省党委不久以前就是这样对待自己的报纸的。省党委没有支持报纸的正确的批评言论，有时省党委工作人员甚至禁止发表批评的稿件。省党委曾经私下规定了错误的作法，按照这种作法，送到编辑部的批评稿件“被校正了”，“被熨平了”，这剥夺了报纸的主动性，并且降低了它的言论的尖锐性。
    非常明显的，这种做法不能帮助报纸上和党的组织中批评和自我批评的展开，降低报纸的尖锐性和原则性，把报纸弄成失去主动性的、灰色的。谁要是抑制和压迫批评和自我批评，他就是杀害党的组织的任何自动性，破坏领导机关在党员群众中的威信，在党的组织的生活中肯定党的死敌——官僚主义者的反党的习癖。
    斯大林同志教导说：“当我们不像布尔什维克所应有的那样公开和诚实地指出和揭露我们的工作缺点和错误的时候，我们就断绝了自己的前进的道路。可是，我们要前进。正因为我们要前进，所以我们应当提出诚实的和革命的自我批评为自己的最主要任务之一。不这样，就没有前进。不这样，就没有发展。”（斯大林全集第十卷，第三三一页）。所以，对批评的任何压制，对于批评的意见，有任何甚至最小的官僚主义态度的表现都应当看做是反对我们共同事业的行动，看做是我们国家向共产主义道路进一步发展的障碍。
    党委必须向报纸要求勇敢的、原则性的、深刻的批评，应当支持报纸的批评言论，帮助报纸使得所发表的稿件产生效果，跟一切对报纸上发表的批评采取官僚主义态度的表现作坚决斗争。
