Zhao Guilan in the Capital
    Song Cheng
    Met Chairman Mao
    On the eve of the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhao Guilan, a good daughter of the Communist Party, met Chairman Mao at a banquet where Chairman Mao entertained specially invited representatives. When she entered the venue to shake hands with Chairman Mao and inquire about his health, Chairman Mao immediately recognized her as Zhao Guilan, the model worker who bravely sacrificed herself to protect the factory. Chairman Mao asked her about her injuries with concern, asking if her hand was better. As the banquet was about to end, Zhao Guilan met Comrade Zhou Enlai again. Comrade Zhou Enlai held her hand for a long time and said to her with infinite gratification: "You are a good Communist Party member, your character is very good. With a young generation like you in the Party, we veteran Party members can rest assured." He also earnestly taught her: "Be brave, but also have wisdom. You have done the first step, and you must study hard in the future; with wisdom, you can better work for the Party." Comrade Zhou Enlai also took her hand and led her to Generals Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Nie Rongzhen, and others, telling everyone about her deeds, and happily said again and again: "Good! Good! With such a young generation, we can rest assured." Zhao Guilan was truly excited that night. In the venue, she focused her attention on Chairman Mao. After the meeting was adjourned and people had left, she still stood reluctantly at the door, looking at Chairman Mao. She felt sincerely happy for Chairman Mao's health. She said that after returning to Lüda, she would tell everyone so that everyone could be happy too. After returning to the dormitory, she was so excited that she couldn't sleep. She thought about what Chairman Mao and Comrade Zhou Enlai had said to her. She would always remember these words of concern and encouragement, like a loving father to his daughter, as a huge driving force for her future studies and work. She thought: If it were not for the Party and Chairman Mao, a poor girl who used to beg for food, an ordinary female worker, would never have dreamed of enjoying such glory!
  Together with Sister Shuai
    When Zhao Guilan was staying in the hospital to recuperate, a comrade read her a section of the story of the female Communist Party member Sister Shuai published in the newspaper every day. The deeds of Sister Shuai inspired her, educated her, and increased her revolutionary confidence and strength. After arriving in Beijing, she never forgot to meet Sister Shuai. Her wish was finally fulfilled. On the fourth day after arriving in Beijing, she met Sister Shuai. She took Sister Shuai's hand, sat with her on a sofa, and peacefully told Sister Shuai about her situation before and after her injury, and asked about Sister Shuai's health with concern. At this time, she looked so innocent and happy, like a child reunited with her long-separated mother. Sister Shuai encouraged her, comforted her, and told her to pay attention to nutrition and improve her health. And she especially told her: Don't be proud, study hard; you can study in the Party School for a few more years, first learn culture, then learn politics, so that you can better work for the Party in the future.
    People's Love
    Heroes and models who are willing to dedicate their lives for the cause of the people will inevitably receive the people's highest respect and love. Wherever Zhao Guilan went, the working people warmly welcomed her and expressed their sympathy. On the way to Beijing, on the train from Lüda to Shenyang, without anyone introducing her, people had already recognized her as Zhao Guilan. So the conductors and passengers on the train ran to shake hands with her, inquire about her health, pay their respects to her, and ask her to tell the story of her not throwing the fulminate of mercury. The train traveled for ten hours, and the carriage she was in was lively for ten hours. The conductor enthusiastically brought her a small table and found soda bottles to hold the flowers that the well-wishers had given her. When the train entered Shenyang Station, Zhao Guilan received an even grander welcome. After she boarded the train from Shenyang to Beijing, she became the focus of the respectful and loving gaze of the fellow representatives, conductors, and passengers.
    When Zhao Guilan arrived in the capital, the workers, women, and people from all walks of life in the capital who met her gave this glorious young Communist Party member the same respect and honor.
    The Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a conference of more than 3,000 workers at the Laboring People's Cultural Palace, inviting labor heroes attending and attending the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to make reports. As soon as Zhao Guilan entered the door, a worker immediately ran in and shouted to everyone: "Zhao Guilan is here!" The workers ran out in jubilation and lifted her high. A worker from a towel weaving factory, after hearing her deeds, told others that Zhao Guilan's report encouraged his confidence in overcoming difficulties, and he was determined to work harder to run his small factory well. When she was about to leave the venue, countless autograph books surged onto the stage one after another, asking her to sign. When leaving the Cultural Palace, she said touchingly to her companion who was with her: "I have not done anything for the Party, the workers in Beijing welcome me so warmly, I must learn from them."
    When the All-China Women's Federation entertained Zhao Guilan, Li Xiuzhen, and Gong Jinmei, as soon as Zhao Guilan entered the courtyard, the comrades who were eating in the house rushed out, applauding to welcome them. Some were still holding chopsticks in their hands, and the cooks were still wearing oil aprons. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions also entertained her, and the labor-capital conference held by the Ministry of Labor also invited her to attend and make a report. During the recess of the conference, she was simply overwhelmed.
    During the National Committee meeting, during breaks, people were constantly looking for her to talk or take pictures. When a representative sitting behind her discovered that she was Zhao Guilan, he walked up to her and sincerely asked to shake her hand. An elderly person also came to her seat and inquired about her health with concern. Once, as she walked towards the venue, the guards recognized her, and they whispered to each other: "This is Zhao Guilan, who bravely protected the factory!" So they quickly chased after her to see her, believing that having the opportunity to see her was a great honor.
    The tea servers and barbers in the hotel where she lived also found the "New China Women" magazine and looked up the records of her deeds. When she went out to buy shoes, the shoe store clerks, seeing the name on the order form, immediately asked her in surprise: "Are you Zhao Guilan who was published in the newspaper?" Many people who heard about it ran over to greet and salute her. The workers, soldiers, students, staff... of the capital had already recognized her from the photos in the newspaper. When she went out to visit, everyone looked at her with admiration and love as soon as they saw her coming, and told those who did not recognize her, "She is Zhao Guilan!"
    The Hard Bone of a Communist Party Member
    Someone asked: Why would a twenty-year-old young girl do such an amazing thing? This time, Zhao Guilan personally answered this question. She said simply: "This is due to the Party's education." She said that when she was in that critical situation, she had also thought about throwing the fulminate of mercury out. But in that instant, she immediately thought of what the Party had taught her during Party lessons: "Under any circumstances, the interests of the individual should be subordinate to the interests of the Party." It was such a noble belief that gave her great courage and strength, and she held the fulminate of mercury and did not throw it out. When she was changing dressings and undergoing surgery, she was in so much pain that she was sweating profusely, and even fainted, she was still thinking: "I am a Communist Party member, if I cry and scream, people will definitely say that a Communist Party member cannot even endure this little bit of pain." So she did not cry or scream, and endured all the unspeakable pain with gritted teeth. Some patients in the hospital could not understand why a twenty-year-old girl had such amazing perseverance, and an old Communist Party member told them: "This is the hard bone of a Communist Party member!" The noble qualities of the Bolsheviks and the working class were demonstrated in Zhao Guilan in such a concrete and moving way. Precisely because Zhao Guilan has such qualities, her emotions are highly pure and healthy. People who see her may feel more or less regret for her disability. But Zhao Guilan's cheerful laughter will immediately strike this unhealthy emotion, making people naturally happy with her. As she said in her speech at the Second Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC: "Although I was injured and disabled because of my love for labor and love for the property of the motherland, my thinking has not been disabled, so I am not discouraged at all." Zhao Guilan naturally and completely melted the individual and the Party together. People can understand from her what "selflessness" means, and understand why she was able to transcend all personal troubles in such a painful situation, always be happy, and always maintain the confidence to move forward.

　　赵桂兰在首都
    宋琤
    见了毛主席
    中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议开会前夕，共产党的好女儿——赵桂兰，在毛主席欢宴特邀代表的宴会上见到了毛主席。当她走进会场去和毛主席握手问候毛主席健康时，毛主席立刻认出她就是为了保全工厂而勇敢地牺牲自己的护厂模范赵桂兰。毛主席关切地问她的伤势，问她的手好了没有。宴会快要散的时候，赵桂兰又见到了周恩来同志。周恩来同志长久地握住她的手，无限欣慰地向她说：“你是一个好共产党员，你的品质很好。党有了你这样的年轻的一代，我们老党员就放心了。”并且谆谆地教诲她：“要勇敢，还要有智慧。你做到了第一步，以后还要好好学习；有了智慧才能更好地为党工作。”周恩来同志又拉着她的手带她到刘伯承、邓小平、聂荣臻等将军面前，把她的事迹告诉大家，又高兴地连连说：“好！好！有了这样的年轻的一代，咱们可以放心了。”这一晚上，赵桂兰真是太兴奋了。在会场上，她聚精会神地注视着毛主席。散会了，人们都走了，她还恋恋不舍地站在门口看着毛主席。她为毛主席的健康而感到衷心的喜悦。她说她回旅大后要好好告诉大家，也让大家高兴高兴。回到宿舍后，她兴奋得睡不着觉。她想着毛主席和周恩来同志对她讲的话。这些象慈父对女儿一样的关怀和勉励的话，她将永远记在心头，作为今后学习和工作的巨大推动力量。她想：假如没有党和毛主席，一个要过饭的穷苦女孩子，平凡的女工，做梦也不会梦到会享有这样的光荣啊！
  和帅大姐在一起
    赵桂兰在病院里住着养伤的时候，曾有一位同志每天给她读一段报上登的女共产党员帅大姐的故事。帅大姐的事迹鼓舞了她，教育了她，使她更增加了革命信心和力量。到北京后，她就念念不忘地要见一见帅大姐。她的愿望终于达到了。来京后的第四天，她见到了帅大姐。她拉着帅大姐的手，和帅大姐坐在一个沙发上，安详地向帅大姐叙说她受伤前后的情况，并且关心地问询帅大姐的健康。这时候，她显得那样天真愉快，象是孩子重逢了久别的妈妈一样。帅大姐鼓励她，安慰她，告诉她要注意营养，增进健康。并且特别嘱咐她：不要骄傲，要好好地学习；可以在党校多学习几年，先学文化，再学政治，将来更好地为党工作。
    群众的爱戴
    为了人民的事业甘愿奉献出自己生命的英雄和模范，必然会受到人民崇高的尊敬和爱戴。赵桂兰走到那里，那里就有劳动人民热烈地欢迎她，慰问她。在来北京的路上，在从旅大到沈阳的火车上，并没有人介绍，人们就已认出了她是赵桂兰。于是列车上的乘务员和旅客们就川流不息地跑来和她握手，问候她的健康，向她致敬，并要她讲她不扔雷汞的故事。列车行进了十个钟头，她所乘坐的车厢里热闹了十个钟头。乘务员热情地为她搬来了小桌子，找来汽水瓶插上欢送者献给她的鲜花。列车进入沈阳车站，赵桂兰更受到了盛大的欢迎。她乘上了从沈阳到北京的列车后，又成为同行的代表、乘务员、旅客们尊敬与爱戴的目光注意的焦点。
    赵桂兰到了首都，首都的工人、妇女和见到了她的各阶层人民，同样给予这位光荣的年轻的共产党员以尊敬和荣誉。
    北京市总工会在劳动人民文化宫召开了三千多工友的大会，邀请出席及列席人民政协全国委员会二次会议的劳动英雄作报告。赵桂兰一进门，有一位工友立刻奔跑进去大声告诉大家：“赵桂兰来了！”工友们狂欢地跑出来把她高高地举起来。织毛巾工厂的一位工友，听了她的事迹后告诉别人说，赵桂兰的报告鼓舞了他克服困难的信心，他决心更加努力搞好自己的小工厂。在她要离开会场的时候，数不清的要求签名的纪念册，一个接着一个地涌上台来要求她签名。在离开文化宫时，她感动地对和她同去的同伴说：“我并没有为党做过什么工作，北京的工友们这样热烈地欢迎我，我一定要好好向他们学习。”
    全国民主妇联招待赵桂兰、李秀真和龚金妹时，赵桂兰一进院子，正在房子里吃饭的同志们就一涌而出，鼓掌欢迎。有的手里还拿着筷子，炊事员的身上还系着油围裙。全国总工会也招待了她，劳动部召开的劳资会议也请她出席做报告。在大会休息日里，她简直应接不暇。
    在全国委员会会议期中，每逢休息时间，总是不断有人找她谈话或者是照像。坐在她后面的一位代表发现了她就是赵桂兰时，走到她面前诚恳地要求和她握手。一位老者也到她的座位前殷殷地问询她的健康。有一次，当她走向会场时，警卫的战士们认出了她，他们悄悄地互相传说：“这就是那英勇护厂的赵桂兰！”于是赶紧追上去看她，认为有机会见到她是莫大的荣幸。
    她住的旅馆里的茶役、理发师，也都找到“新中国妇女”杂志，翻看关于她的事迹的记载。她出去买鞋，鞋店伙友看到订单上的名字时，立刻惊喜地问她：“你就是报上登的那个赵桂兰？”许多人听到了都跑来向她问候、致敬。首都的工人、战士、学生、职员……大都已经从报纸上的照片认得了她。她出去参观时，大家一见她走来，就都以仰慕和敬爱的神色望着她，并且告诉还不认得她的人，“她就是赵桂兰！”
    共产党员的硬骨头
    有人问：一位二十岁的年轻姑娘为什么会做出那么惊人的事迹呢？这次赵桂兰亲自回答了这个问题。她纯朴地说：“这是由于党对我的教育。”她说，当她在那危急情况中，也曾想把雷汞扔出去。但在这一瞬间她立刻想到上党课时党曾教育她：“不论在什么情况下，个人的利益应服从党的利益。”就是这样一个崇高的信念给了她以巨大的勇气和力量，她握着雷汞没有扔出去。她在换药动手术时疼得汗如雨下，甚至晕了过去时还想着：“我是共产党员，我要是哭哭叫叫，人家一定会说共产党员连这一点痛苦都不能忍受。”于是她一声也没有哭叫，咬牙忍受着一切难言的疼痛。医院中有一些伤病员不能理解一个二十岁的女孩子为什么会有这样惊人的坚持力，有一位老共产党员就告诉她们说：“这就是共产党员的硬骨头！”布尔什维克和工人阶级的高贵的品质，在赵桂兰身上就是这样具体动人地表现了出来。正因为赵桂兰具有这样的品质，她的情感是高度的纯洁和健康。见到她的人，也许会为她的残废而或多或少的感到遗憾。但是赵桂兰的愉快的笑声，立刻会给这不健康的情绪以打击，使得人们自然地跟着她一起愉快起来。正如她在政协全国委员会二次会议上的发言中所说的：“我虽是由于热爱劳动和热爱祖国的财产负了伤，成了残废，但我的思想并未残废，因此我一点也不灰心。”赵桂兰是那么自然地把个人和党完全溶化在一起。人们从她的身上可以体会到什么叫做“忘我”，体会到为什么她在那样痛苦的情况中能够超脱一切个人的烦恼，永远愉快，永远保持着前进的信心。（附图片）
