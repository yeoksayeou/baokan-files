Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 27th, TASS dispatch: On June 25th, the Security Council, based on the "request" of the US representative to the Security Council, Gross, held an "emergency meeting" to review the Korean situation.

At the beginning of the Security Council members' meeting, the Indian representative, Rau, who was serving as chairman, proposed that the issue on the agenda should be briefly stated as follows: "Accusation of aggression against the Republic of Korea."

The US representative, Gross, arbitrarily asserted that North Korean ground forces were attacking South Korea. He presented the Korean situation from this point of view.

Gross then presented the US proposal, which groundlessly accused the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of armed invasion of South Korea. The proposal was based on this false assertion, stating "breach of peace," and proposed: (1) Demanding that the North Korean authorities: (A) immediately cease fighting; (B) withdraw armed forces to the 38th parallel; (2) Requesting the United Nations Commission on Korea: (A) to monitor the withdrawal of North Korean armed forces to the 38th parallel; (B) to report to the Security Council on the implementation of this resolution; (3) Requiring all member states to assist the United Nations in implementing this resolution in every way, and not to aid North Korea.

The representative of the Syngman Rhee clique, Chang Myon, spoke after Gross, reciting the US statement.

The British representative, Shawcross, said that those present listened to Chang Myon's statement with "sympathy." He said he had nothing to add to the statement of the US representative.

After other representatives spoke, the meeting was temporarily adjourned.

When the members of the Security Council reconvened, Rau read the revised US draft. The introductory part remained unchanged, and although the final part of the resolution had been slightly modified, the substance remained the same. The proposal put forward by Gross was passed.

Observers here noted the fact that the Soviet representative did not attend the meeting of the Security Council members on June 25th. The other permanent member of the Security Council, the legitimate representative of China, was also absent. Because any resolution of the Security Council on substantive issues requires the unanimous agreement of the permanent members to comply with the United Nations Charter, it is clear that the meeting of the Security Council members on June 25th could not pass any resolution with legal effect.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 27th: The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued the following statement on June 27th: According to information received here, the United Nations Security Council, under the pressure of the US government, discussed the Korean situation caused by the Syngman Rhee bandit gang launching a civil war on June 25th. The discussion and decision of the Security Council on the Korean issue, firstly, because the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea did not participate in the discussion and decision on the Korean issue; secondly, because representatives of major powers such as the Soviet Union and China did not participate in the Security Council meeting, therefore, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea hereby declares: It considers this discussion and decision to be illegal.

　　联合国安理会在美帝压迫下
    非法通过美帝关于朝鲜的提案
    没有中苏代表参加显见决议违反宪章
    朝鲜共和国声明否认安理会非法决议
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约二十七日电：六月二十五日安理会根据安理会内的美国代表葛罗斯的“请求”，举行“紧急会议”，以审议朝鲜局势。
    安理会理事们的会议开始时，担任主席的印度代表劳氏提议说：议程上的这个问题应该简明陈述如下：“控诉对大韩民国的侵略”。
    美国代表葛罗斯武断说北朝鲜的地面部队进攻南朝鲜。他从这种观点来陈述朝鲜局势。
    葛罗斯继即提出美国的提案，其中毫无实据地诬控朝鲜民主主义人民共和国武装侵入南朝鲜。提案就以这种虚妄的说法为根据，指陈“和平的破裂”。并提出：（一）要求北朝鲜当局：（甲）立刻停止战斗行动；（乙）将武装部队退到北纬三十八度；（二）请联合国朝鲜委员会，（甲）监视北朝鲜武装部队向北纬三十八度撤退；（乙）向安理会陈报这个决议案的执行情况；（三）要求一切会员国以一切方式协助联合国执行这个决议案。而切勿援助北朝鲜。
    李承晚集团的代表张勉在葛罗斯之后发言，把美国的说法背诵一遍。
    英国代表萧恩说：出席的那些人都以“同情”的态度倾听张勉的声明。他说，他没有什么话可以补充美国代表的声明了。
    其他代表们发言后，就暂告休会。
    当安理会的理事们复会时，劳氏宣读修正过的美国草案。绪言部分毫无变更，决议的最后一部分虽已略加修改，但是实质也依然没有改变。葛罗斯所提出的提案通过了。
    此间人士注意到一种事实，即苏联代表没有出席六月二十五日安理会理事们的会议。安理会的另一常任理事国、即中国的合法代表也是缺席的。因为安理会关于问题实质的任何决议，都需要取得常任理事国的一致协议，这项决议才符合联合国宪章，所以很明显的，安理会理事们六月二十五日的会议，决不能通过具有法定效力的任何决议。
    【新华社平壤二十七日讯】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府于六月二十七日发表声明如下：根据此间接获的情报，联合国安全理事会于六月二十五日在美国政府的压迫下，讨论了因李承晚匪帮发动内战而造成的朝鲜形势。安全理事会对朝鲜问题的讨论和决定，第一，由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府没有参加有关朝鲜问题的讨论和决定；第二，由于安全理事会的会议没有像苏联与中国那样的大国的代表参加，因此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府特声明：它认定这一讨论与决定是非法的。
