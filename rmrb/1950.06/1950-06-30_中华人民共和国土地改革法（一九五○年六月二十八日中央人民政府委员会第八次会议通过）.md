Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China
(Passed at the Eighth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on June 28, 1950)

Chapter I General Principles

Article 1: Abolish the feudal exploitation of land ownership by the landlord class and implement the system of peasant land ownership, thereby liberating rural productive forces, developing agricultural production, and paving the way for the industrialization of New China.

Chapter II Confiscation and Requisition of Land

Article 2: Confiscate the land, draught animals, farm implements, surplus grain, and surplus housing of landlords in the countryside. However, other properties of landlords will not be confiscated.

Article 3: Requisition land and other public land in rural areas belonging to ancestral halls, temples, monasteries, churches, schools, and organizations. However, for schools, orphanages, nursing homes, hospitals, and other undertakings that rely on income from the above-mentioned land for maintenance expenses, the local people's government shall find appropriate solutions to resolve funding.

With the consent of the local Hui people, land owned by mosques may be appropriately retained.

Article 4: Protect industry and commerce, and do not infringe upon them.

Industry and commerce concurrently operated by landlords, as well as the land and property directly used for operating industry and commerce, shall not be confiscated. Industry and commerce shall not be infringed upon due to the confiscation of feudal land property.

Land owned by industrialists and merchants in rural areas and houses originally inhabited by peasants shall be requisitioned. However, their other properties and legitimate operations in rural areas shall be protected and not infringed upon.

Article 5: Revolutionary soldiers, families of martyrs, workers, staff, self-employed individuals, peddlers, and those who rent out small amounts of land due to engaging in other occupations or lack of labor shall not be classified as landlords. Those whose average land ownership per person does not exceed 200% of the local average land ownership per person (for example, if the local average land ownership is two mu per person, and the average land ownership per person in the household does not exceed four mu) shall retain their land. If the land was indeed purchased with their own labor income, or if they are widowers, widows, orphans, or disabled persons who rely on the land for livelihood, appropriate consideration may be given even if the average land ownership per person exceeds 200%.

Article 6: Protect the land and other property owned by rich peasants through self-cultivation and hired labor, and do not infringe upon them.

Small amounts of land rented out by rich peasants shall also be retained; however, in certain special areas, with the approval of the people's government above the provincial level, a portion or all of the rented land may be requisitioned.

Semi-landlord-type rich peasants who rent out large amounts of land exceeding the amount of land they cultivate themselves and through hired labor shall have their rented land requisitioned. The land rented in by rich peasants shall be offset against the land they rent out.

Article 7: Protect the land and other property of middle peasants (including well-to-do middle peasants), and do not infringe upon them.

Article 8: All land that should be confiscated or requisitioned according to this law shall be considered invalid if it has been transferred or dispersed through sale, mortgage, gift, or other means after the local liberation. This land shall be included in the amount of land to be distributed. However, if peasants have suffered significant losses due to buying or mortgaging land, appropriate compensation shall be provided.

Article 9: The legal definitions of landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, poor peasants, hired peasants, and other rural social class components shall be separately determined.

Chapter III Distribution of Land

Article 10: All land and other means of production confiscated and requisitioned, except those stipulated by this law to be owned by the state, shall be received by the township peasant associations and distributed uniformly, fairly, and reasonably to poor peasants who have no land, little land, and lack other means of production. Landlords shall also be given an equal share so that they can maintain their livelihoods by their own labor and reform themselves through labor.

Article 11: Land shall be distributed by the township or equivalent administrative village, based on the original cultivation, and uniformly distributed according to population, land quantity, quality, and distance, using methods of drawing lots and making adjustments. However, district or county peasant associations may make necessary adjustments between townships or equivalent administrative villages. In areas with vast land and sparse population, land may also be distributed in smaller units below the township level for ease of cultivation. Intersecting lands between townships shall be allocated to the township whose peasants originally cultivated them.

Article 12: When distributing land based on the original cultivation, the land owned by the original cultivating peasants shall not be extracted for distribution. When the land rented in by the original cultivating peasants is extracted for distribution, appropriate consideration should be given to the original cultivating peasants. The land distributed to the original cultivating peasants (including their own land) should be appropriately more than the land owned by local landless and land-poor peasants after distribution, with the principle of ensuring that the original cultivating peasants retain land equivalent to the local average land per person.

Original cultivating peasants who have field surface rights on rented land should be retained land equivalent to the local price of field surface rights when extracting land.

Article 13: In the distribution of land, the following are the handling of certain special issues among the landless and land-poor population:

1.  Poor peasants with only one or two people but with labor ability shall be distributed more land than those with one or two people if the land conditions in the township permit.
2.  Handicraft workers, peddlers, self-employed individuals, and their families in rural areas should be appropriately distributed some land and other means of production. However, those whose occupational income is sufficient to regularly maintain their family life may not be distributed land.
3.  Families of martyrs residing in rural areas (the martyr himself can be calculated in the family population), commanders and combatants of the People's Liberation Army, honorary soldiers, demobilized soldiers, personnel of the People's Government and people's organizations, and their families (including families accompanying the army) should be distributed the same amount of land and other means of production as peasants. However, the personnel of the People's Government and people's organizations may be appropriately distributed less or not distributed land depending on the amount of their salary income and other income and the extent to which they can maintain their family life.
4.  If a person is engaged in other occupations outside while the family resides in rural areas, the family should be appropriately distributed land and other means of production. Those whose occupational income is sufficient to regularly maintain their family life may not be distributed land.
5.  Monks, nuns, Taoists, pastors, and imams in rural areas who have labor ability and are willing to engage in agricultural production but have no other occupation to maintain their livelihood should be distributed the same amount of land and other means of production as peasants.
6.  Unemployed workers and their families who have been certified as unemployed by the urban people's government or trade union, who return to their hometowns and request land distribution and are able to engage in agricultural production, should be distributed the same amount of land and other means of production as peasants if local land conditions permit.
7.  Landlords who have fled and returned home and personnel who have worked for the enemy and have now returned home, and their families, who have labor ability and are willing to engage in agricultural production to maintain their livelihoods, should be distributed the same amount of land and other means of production as peasants.
8.  Traitors, national traitors, war criminals, heinous counter-revolutionaries, and criminals who resolutely sabotage land reform who have been determined by the People's Government and reside in rural villages shall not be distributed land. Family members who have not participated in criminal activities, have no other occupation to maintain their livelihoods, have labor ability, and are willing to engage in agricultural production should be distributed the same amount of land and other means of production as peasants.

Article 14: When distributing land, a small amount of land may be reserved at the township level based on the local land situation to be used for households that are away from home and whose situation is unclear, and for fugitive households to cultivate when they return home, or for land adjustment in the township. This land shall be temporarily managed by the township people's government and rented to peasants for cultivation. However, the land reserved shall not exceed 1% of the total land in the township.

Article 15: When distributing land, the people's government above the county level may, according to the local land situation, appropriately allocate a portion of the land to be owned by the state for use as agricultural experiment stations or state-run demonstration farms within the scope of a county or several counties. Before farms are established, this land may be rented to peasants for cultivation.

Chapter IV Handling of Special Land Issues

Article 16: Confiscated and requisitioned mountains, forests, fish ponds, tea plantations, tung tree plantations, mulberry fields, bamboo forests, orchards, reed fields, wasteland, and other divisible land should be converted into ordinary land at appropriate ratios for unified distribution. In order to facilitate production, peasants who originally engaged in such production should be given priority in the distribution. Those who are distributed such land may be distributed less or not distributed ordinary cultivated land. If the distribution is not conducive to management, the local people's government may democratically manage and rationally operate it in accordance with the original customs.

Article 17: Confiscated and requisitioned weirs, ponds, and other water conservancy facilities that can be distributed should be distributed along with the fields. Those that are not suitable for distribution may be democratically managed by the local people's government in accordance with the original customs.

Article 18: Large forests, large water conservancy projects, large wastelands, large barren hills, large salt fields, and mines, as well as lakes, marshes, rivers, and ports, shall be owned by the state and managed and operated by the people's government. Those originally invested and operated by private individuals shall continue to be operated by the original operators in accordance with the laws and decrees promulgated by the people's government.

Article 19: Farmland, nurseries, agricultural experiment stations, and technically advanced large bamboo gardens, large orchards, large tea plantations, large tung tree plantations, large mulberry fields, and large pastures that are cultivated using machinery or have other advanced equipment shall be continued to be operated by the original operators and shall not be dispersed. However, if the land ownership originally belonged to the landlord, it may be taken over by the state with the approval of the people's government above the provincial level.

Article 20: When confiscating and requisitioning land, graves and trees on graveyards shall not be moved.

Article 21: Scenic spots, historical sites, and historical relics should be properly protected. Ancestral halls, temples, monasteries, churches, and other public buildings and the houses of landlords shall not be destroyed. Surplus houses of landlords in rural areas that are not suitable for peasants to use may be managed by the local people's government and used for public purposes.

Article 22: Wasteland reclaimed after liberation shall not be confiscated during land distribution and shall continue to be cultivated by the original reclaimers, not included in the amount of land to be distributed.

Article 23: Small amounts of land necessary for maintaining public welfare undertakings in rural areas, such as repairing bridges, roads, tea pavilions, and free ferries, may be retained according to the original customs and shall not be distributed.

Article 24: The land and houses owned by overseas Chinese should be handled by the Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Political Committee) or the Provincial People's Government in accordance with the general principles of this law, in accordance with the principle of taking care of the interests of overseas Chinese.

Article 25: Sandy fields and lake fields owned by landlords or public organizations shall be owned by the state and handled by the people's government above the provincial level in accordance with appropriate methods.

Article 26: Land along railways, highways, and rivers for road protection and dike protection, as well as land occupied by airports, seaports, and fortresses, shall not be distributed. The land to be reserved for railways, highways, rivers, and airports that have been designated for routes and specified dates for opening shall be approved by the people's government above the provincial level.

Article 27: Land owned by the state and operated by private individuals shall not be rented out, sold, or abandoned by the operators. If the original operator does not need the land, it must be returned to the state.

Chapter V Land Reform Implementation Organs and Implementation Methods

Article 28: In order to strengthen the leadership of the people's government over land reform work, during the land reform period, the people's governments at all levels above the county level shall organize land reform committees by electing appropriate numbers of personnel through people's representative conferences or appointing them by the people's government at the next higher level to be responsible for guiding and handling various matters related to land reform.

Article 29: Village peasant congresses, peasant representative conferences, and the peasant association committees elected by them, and peasant representative congresses and the peasant association committees elected by them at the district, county, and provincial levels are the legal executive organs for reforming the land system.

Article 30: After the land reform is completed, the people's government shall issue land ownership certificates and recognize the rights of all land owners to freely operate, buy, sell, and lease their land. All land contracts prior to the land system reform shall be invalidated.

Article 31: When defining class components, it shall be based on the decision on dividing rural class components promulgated by the Central People's Government, and democratically evaluated by village peasant congresses and peasant representative conferences under the leadership of the village people's government through self-reporting and public discussion methods. Those who have not participated in the peasant association shall also be invited to attend the meeting to participate in the evaluation and be allowed to defend themselves. After the evaluation, the village people's government shall report to the district people's government for approval. If the person or others have different opinions, they may file an appeal to the county people's court within fifteen days after approval, and the county people's court shall make a judgment and execute it.

Article 32: In order to ensure the implementation of land reform, during the land reform period, each county shall organize people's courts to conduct circuit trials and legally try and punish evil despots and all criminals who violate or sabotage land reform laws and are hated by the broad masses of the people and demanded to be punished. It is strictly forbidden to arbitrarily arrest, beat, kill, and use various corporal punishments and disguised corporal punishments.

The organizational regulations of the people's court shall be separately determined.
