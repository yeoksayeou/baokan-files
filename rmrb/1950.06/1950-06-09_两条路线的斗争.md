    The Struggle of Two Lines
    The struggle between the Soviet Union's policy of peace and the imperialist bloc's policy of war is increasingly focusing on the German question.

    The Soviet Union has consistently adhered to the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, regarding Germany as a single political and economic entity, and working to eliminate militarism and implement democratic reforms. The Soviet Union has consistently supported the German people's struggle to establish an independent, peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany, supported the National Front of Democratic Germany's demands for the conclusion of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of occupation forces, and has provided substantial economic assistance to the revival of Democratic Germany. Thanks to this assistance, the German Democratic Republic, which was only established eight months ago, has been able to steadily move forward. For example, the 1950 budget has already eliminated the deficit. Industrial production in the first quarter of this year exceeded the plan by 3 percent, an increase of 34 percent compared to the first quarter of 1949. Price reductions were implemented twice in March and May of this year. Democratic Germany has essentially eliminated unemployment. It should be particularly noted that the Soviet government recently announced the reduction of half of Germany's remaining reparations (3.171 billion U.S. dollars) and the transfer of twenty-three enterprises to the German people, two generous decisions. The further development of Democratic Germany's peaceful economy and the further improvement of the German people's living standards will thus be facilitated even more favorably.

    Facts once again prove that the policy implemented by the Soviet Union is a policy of promoting the unification of Germany and its peaceful construction on a democratic basis. This not only conforms to the interests of the German people, but also to the interests of all peace-loving people in Europe. However, the American, British, and French imperialists have adopted a completely opposite policy—a policy of impoverishing, colonizing, and turning West Germany into a military base.

    Almost at the same time that the Soviet government announced the reduction of reparations and the transfer of enterprises, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France issued a declaration on the German question. They told the German people that the occupation statutes would remain in effect and that the occupation forces would continue to be stationed in West Germany. They decided to occupy West Germany for a long time, turning West Germany into a military springboard for attacking the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democracies. Politically, they decided to pull the Bonn puppet government into the "Council of Europe," making it a docile tool dependent on the war camp and serving the imperialist war policy. The American and French imperialists are not satisfied with annexing the Saar coal mining area, and have further proposed the so-called "Schuman Plan" to separate the entire West German coal mines and heavy industry from its economic structure and place them under the control of international trusts. This is a further enslavement of the West German people and the West German economy.

    On the other hand, the Western occupying countries put on various poses to conceal their sinful policies. They suggested implementing so-called all-German elections on the condition of recognizing the Bonn puppet government as a fait accompli, attempting to shift the responsibility for obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany onto the Soviet Union. They slander the Soviet Union's declaration on the repatriation of prisoners of war, but their purpose is to organize thousands upon thousands of former Nazi soldiers into so-called "mercenaries" and send them to fight in many places. They sent a note to the Soviet Union to cancel the People's Police of Democratic Germany, but in fact, they are organizing secret armed police in various states of West Germany.

    However, the imperialists' sinful policies and the shameful actions of their running dogs, Adenauer and Schumacher, will only arouse greater anger and resistance from the German people (including the West German people), and will only make the German people more aware that the Soviet Union is their most reliable friend. The peace demonstration of 500,000 German youths in Berlin and the peace signatures of nearly 20 million German people powerfully prove the success of the Soviet Union's peace policy and the failure of the imperialist bloc's war policy.

### 两条路线的斗争

    两条路线的斗争
    苏联的和平政策和帝国主义集团的战争政策这两条路线的斗争，越来越集中地表现在德国问题的斗争上。
    苏联始终遵守波茨坦协定的原则，把德国视为政治上、经济上的单一的整体，使德国肃清军国主义化而实行民主的改造。苏联一贯支持德国人民为建立一个独立、和平、民主与统一的德国而进行的斗争，支持民主德国全国阵线关于缔结和约、撤退占领军的要求，并在经济上大力援助民主德国的复兴。由于这种帮助，刚刚成立了八个月的德意志民主共和国，已经能够稳步地向前发展。例如一九五○年的预算中已经消灭了赤字。今年第一季的工业生产超过计划的百分之三，比一九四九年第一季的生产增加了百分之三十四。今年三月和五月间，两度实行削减物价。民主德国基本上已经消除了失业的现象。应该特别提出的，是苏联政府最近宣布削减德国赔偿余额的半数（三十一亿七千一百万美元），以及移交二十三个企业给德国人民这两项慷慨决定。民主德国和平经济的进一步发展和德国人民生活水平的进一步提高，将因此而获得更加有利的条件。
    事实再一次地证明：苏联所实行的政策，是在民主的基础上促进德国的统一及其和平建设的政策。这不仅符合德国人民的利益，也符合全欧洲爱好和平的各国人民的利益。但是，美英法帝国主义者采取了与此完全相反的政策——使西德贫穷化、殖民地化、军事基地化的政策。
    差不多在苏联政府宣布削减赔偿和移交企业的同时，美、英、法三国外长发表了关于德国问题的宣言。他们告诉德国人民，占领法规将继续有效，占领军队将继续留驻西德。他们决定长期占领西德，把西德变成进攻苏联和东欧人民民主国家的军事跳板。在政治上，他们决定把波恩傀儡政府拉入“欧洲委员会”，使之成为依附于战争阵营，并为帝国主义战争政策服务的驯服工具。美、法帝国主义者并不以并吞萨尔煤矿区为满足，进一步提出了所谓“舒曼计划”，要把整个西德的煤矿和重工业从它的经济结构中分裂出去，置于国际托拉斯的控制之下。这是对于西德人民和西德经济的进一步奴役。
    另一方面，西方占领国家装出各种姿态来掩饰自己的罪恶政策。他们建议在承认波恩傀儡政府这个既成事实的条件下，实行所谓全德选举，企图把阻碍签订对德和约的责任推到苏联的身上。他们诽谤苏联的遣俘声明，其目的却是为了把成千成万的前纳粹军人组织所谓“雇佣军”，送到许多地方去作战。他们照会苏联取消民主德国的人民警察，事实上他们正在西德各州组织秘密武装警察。
    但是，帝国主义者的罪恶政策及其走狗阿登纳、舒马赫之流的可耻行为，只会引起德国人民（包括西德人民在内）更大的愤怒和反抗，只会使德国人民更加认识到苏联是他们的最可靠的朋友。五十万德国青年在柏林举行的和平大示威，将近两千万德国人民的和平签名，有力地证明了苏联和平政策的成功，帝国主义集团战争政策的失败。【新华社七日讯】
