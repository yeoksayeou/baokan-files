　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 25th: The meeting of war merchants—this is how diplomatic observer Vasilyev in today’s *Pravda* described the recent meeting in Tokyo between U.S. State Department advisor Dulles, Defense Secretary Johnson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, and American fascist head MacArthur.
　　Vasilyev wrote: This meeting discussed the issue of further enslaving Japan and turning Japan into a U.S. military springboard in the Far East. According to a report in the *New York Herald Tribune*, MacArthur has already conceived of a special military-economic plan for the Far East—something like an "American Pacific Pact"—to strengthen the U.S. interventionist policy in the region. American imperialists have not given up their aim of strengthening their position in Japan in the slightest. They have trampled on the Potsdam Declaration; instead of disarming Japan and democratizing it, they are rearming Japanese militarists and cultivating fascism. Remarks in foreign bourgeois newspapers show that the following issues were clearly on the table at the Tokyo meeting of Dulles, Johnson, Bradley, and MacArthur: what kind of deal should be made between U.S. monopoly capitalists and Japanese monopoly capitalists to ensure unlimited U.S. domination in Japan. The U.S. has completely undermined the Potsdam Declaration and is preparing to forcibly impose a separate treaty on Japan. According to the Associated Press, it can be seen from Dulles’s statement that the “treaty” is merely a replica of the occupation regulations currently used in West Germany, applied to Japan.
　　The actual steps currently being taken by the American occupation authorities to guarantee U.S. military bases in Japan are completely consistent with these plans. They have long had a hand in the military bases of Yokosuka, Kure, Sasebo, and Okinawa. Johnson, Dulles, and Bradley unanimously declared in Tokyo: it is necessary to ensure that the United States occupies these bases for a long time.
　　Vasilyev said: In their negotiations, the Japanese puppet Prime Minister Yoshida and his lackeys eagerly expressed their extreme willingness to "lease" military bases to the United States. The Yoshida group has once again exposed its true colors, betraying the interests of the Japanese nation and attempting to drag the Japanese people into a new massacre adventure.
　　Vasilyev concluded: Although the American and Japanese reactionaries carried out terror against communists and social progressives before the arrival of Truman’s special envoys in Japan to prevent people from protesting against the American policy toward Japan, many slogans demanding that the United States stop arming Japan and withdraw its occupying forces appeared on the streets after Dulles arrived in Tokyo. The Japanese people do not want their country to become a colony, a springboard for new wars of aggression; they do not want to serve as "cannon fodder" in this war. They are rising up with increasing determination to fight for the peace, freedom, and independence of Japan.

    揭露美战贩东京会议阴谋
    美帝旨在变日本为新战争跳板
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日电：战争贩子们的会议——这就是外交观察员瓦西里耶夫在今天的真理报上对最近美国国务院顾问杜勒斯、国防部长詹逊和参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷在东京和美国法西斯头子麦克阿瑟所开的会议的称呼。
    瓦西里耶夫写道：这个会议是讨论进一步地奴役日本、并把日本变成美国在远东的军事跳板的问题。根据纽约先驱论坛报的报道，麦克阿瑟已经想好了一个远东特别军事经济计划——“美国太平洋公约”之类的东西，用来加强美国在这个地区的干涉政策。美国帝国主义者们一点也不放弃加强他们在日本的地位的目的。他们践踏了波茨坦宣言；他们不但不解除日本武装并把日本民主化，反而重新武装日本军国主义分子并培植法西斯主义。外国资产阶级报纸上的言论表明，明明白白地摆在杜勒斯、詹逊、布莱德雷和麦克阿瑟的东京会议上的是这样的问题：美国垄断资本家们和日本垄断资本家们之间应当进行怎样的交易，以保证美国在日本的无限制的支配。美国完全破坏了波茨坦宣言，准备硬把一个单独和约加在日本身上。根据美联社报道，由杜勒斯的声明里可以看出，“和约”不过是此刻用于西德的占领法规在日本的翻版而已。
    美国占领当局目前正在采取的关于保障美国在日本的军事基地的实际步骤，与这些计划是完全相合的。他们早已染指于横须贺、吴港、佐世保和冲绳岛的军事基地。詹逊、杜勒斯与布莱德雷三人在东京异口同声地宣称：必须保障美国在长期内占有这些基地。
    瓦西里耶夫说：在他们的谈判中，日本傀儡首相吉田及其走狗们迫切地表示他们极愿把军事基地“租借”给美国。吉田集团已再度暴露其真面目，叛卖日本民族利益和企图把日本人民拖入新的大屠杀的冒险。
    瓦西里耶夫最后写道：尽管在杜鲁门的特使们到达日本之前，美国和日本反动派为了预防人民抗议美国对日政策的示威游行而曾经对共产党和社会进步人士施以恐怖，但在杜勒斯一到东京后，街头就出现了许多要求美国停止武装日本和撤退占领军的标语。日本人民不愿意他们的国家变成殖民地，变成新侵略战争的跳板；他们不愿意充当此次战争中的“炮灰”。他们正以日益增长的决心，为争取日本的和平、自由、独立而奋起斗争。
