　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th. According to TASS news agency: Soviet workers are celebrating the ongoing Supreme Soviet meeting with new production achievements.

　　Textile workers at the "Female Worker" factory in Leningrad have won the national socialist competition championship. Workers at the Kuznetsk Combine, a massive metallurgical factory in Siberia, are increasing the speed of metal smelting. The blast furnace workshop has produced hundreds of tons of milled iron more than the June quota; open-hearth furnace operators have overproduced by 150 to 180 tons of steel. Steelworkers in Zaporozhye made 30 accelerated smelts in 13 days in June, and several first-class workers achieved outstanding productivity, producing 9.67 tons of steel per square meter of furnace surface.

　　Many mines in the Kuznetsk coal mining area have completed their six-month coal production plans. Last month, workers using the "Donbas" coal cutting combine cut 10,000 tons of coal per person, and this month it will increase to 12,000 tons. In the Yemba area of Kazakhstan, the speed of oil well drilling has recently doubled, and more than 100 oil well workers have completed their five-year plans ahead of schedule. Five thousand young workers in Tashkent have completed their annual plans.
