How a Private Factory Seeks Legitimate Profit
By our Special Correspondent Xiao Hang

In Wuhan, a few industrialists and businessmen still long for the days of past inflation, attempting to relive their old dreams of speculation and profiteering, and are indifferent to improving their operations. However, there are also some industrialists and businessmen engaged in legitimate operations who consistently adhere to production, do not rely on speculation to seek exorbitant profits, and have not suffered any losses after price stabilization, and their business is getting better and better. The private Meihua Cigarette Factory is one of these legitimate businesses.

I. A Rare Exception
In April, when various industries were encountering sales difficulties, the Meihua Cigarette Factory was crowded with customers placing orders every day. At that time, Meihua's "Red Beauty" brand cigarettes had just been launched, the quality was better than similar cigarettes, and the price was lower, so sales were brisk, reaching the point where some customers had disputes over placing orders, which were only resolved after mediation by the Public Security Bureau. Workers throughout the Meihua factory often worked overtime to fulfill large orders. Therefore, the factory's output in April was particularly prominent. Taking the output of 356 cartons in December of last year as 100, the index for January of this year was 174, February was 89, March was 101, and April suddenly increased to 212, and May was 204. In terms of actual sales, except for some decline in February and March, April and May have also doubled. Taking the actual sales of 410 cartons in December of last year (including some of the previous month's inventory) as 100, January of this year was 121, February was 98, March was 75, April was 198, and May was 168.

Even now, Meihua's manager is keeping his business secrets, so it is difficult to make an accurate calculation of how much money he has made. According to comrades from the trade union, it is estimated that each carton of cigarettes could earn 150,000 yuan in April, and the total sales of 814 cartons in the whole month could earn 122.1 million yuan. At a time when various goods were unsalable and some factories and shops were experiencing serious difficulties, Meihua's ability to earn so much money was a rare exception in the entire city of Wuhan.

II. No Special Mystery
Everyone says that Meihua has a good way of operating, but is it said that there is a special mystery? No. If there is, it is that the operating attitude is more honest.

After Wuhan was liberated in May last year, Meihua switched to producing medium and low-grade cigarettes to supply the rural areas around Wuhan. After a year of efforts, Meihua has gained a large and stable market in the area south of Wuhan and north of Jiujiang.

In order to adapt to the current rural purchasing power, Meihua abolished the unnecessary decorations of cigarettes, and the substitute for glassine paper alone reduced the cost by 57,500 yuan per carton. Under the condition of ensuring quality, the cost of spices has also been considerably reduced. The "Great Wuhan" brand cigarette of Xinghan Cigarette Factory is inferior to Meihua's "Red Beauty" brand cigarette, the former costs 12,000 yuan for spices per carton, while the latter only needs 8,000 yuan.

Reasonable staffing is also an important factor in reducing costs. Meihua has about 220 workers in the whole factory, and only 16 staff members, including the manager, accounting for 7% of the total number of workers. The situation is different in other cigarette factories. For example, the staff of Nanming Cigarette Factory account for 15% of the workers. If the 406 employees of the Universe Cigarette Factory are adjusted according to Meihua's staffing, one-quarter can be reduced. In this way, the expenses of direct workers and indirect workers alone account for 4.6% of the cost of the "Round Ball" brand cigarette in the Universe Factory, 4.5% of the "Great Wuhan" brand cigarette in the Xinghan Factory, and 5.2% of the "Ronghua" brand cigarette in the Nanyang Company, while Meihua's "Red Beauty" brand cigarette only accounts for 3.5%.

The manager of the factory, Xu Rongjie, is a cigarette factory technician by training, and has been in this business since he was sixteen years old. He understands machines, is familiar with the entire production process, and more importantly, he often goes to the workshop to study technology with the workers. If there are not many things outside, he spends at least one or two hours in the factory every day. This is much better than the general factory owners who do not understand production management and are unwilling to go to the factory. Originally, there was a period of time when Meihua's products had problems: the tobacco was too coarse, and there were hollow ends. Later, Xu Rongjie and the workers studied it, eliminated these problems, and made appropriate adjustments to the tightness of the cigarettes, which improved the quality of the finished products.

Xu Rongjie has one advantage in his management method, that is, during the period of inflation, he did not make empty loans and hoard for speculation. The statistical figures of raw material purchases and usage can illustrate this point. From December 1949 to May of this year, a total of 413,349 catties of tobacco leaves were purchased and 400,318 catties were used; 2,110 rolls of 4,000-meter cigarette paper were purchased and 2,172.5 rolls were used (including some of the inventory from November of last year); 380 rolls of 6,000-meter cigarette paper were purchased and 380 rolls were used. According to the monthly check of the statistical table of the staff of the Municipal Taxation Bureau stationed in the factory, it was found that, as the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions investigated: "Meihua Cigarette Factory's raw materials are purchased and used as needed, the purchase price rises and falls with the market price, and the sales rise and fall with the market price, and as a result, it makes money." Some cigarette factories hoarded a large number of tobacco leaves in advance, and when prices fell, they lost money and could not sell them. This situation was almost common in various factories. According to the estimate of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the total loss in Wuhan city due to heavy goods and light currency in the two or three months of price decline was more than 20 billion yuan. Meihua avoided this loss.

III. Not Without Problems
The manager of Meihua does not understand that any enterprise cannot be run well by relying solely on the efforts of the enterprise owner without relying on the workers. Meihua is no exception. When Meihua's products encountered unsalable sales in February and March of this year, it was the workers who carried the cigarettes and promoted them everywhere that opened up the sales channels. At that time, the capitalists showed helplessness. The workers, in the capacity of the masters of the country, worked hard to save money and made their own paste for packaging, saving the capitalists 50,000 yuan a day. The more outstanding achievement was the creation of the city's highest usage of paper rolls. Before liberation, each roll of 4,000-meter cigarette paper in Meihua produced 48,526 cigarettes, now it produces 56,876 cigarettes. The state-owned Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company only produces 52,632 cigarettes per roll, and the Universe Cigarette Factory only produces 51,000 cigarettes. However, the capitalists did not clearly recognize the decisive role of workers in production. Therefore, labor-capital relations have not reached a more united level. Therefore, the rapid establishment of a labor-capital consultation meeting to solve various production-related issues is the key to improving Meihua's production. At the same time, the "body search system" that still exists in the factory, which insults the personality of workers, must be abolished.

Another problem is that there is an unreasonable difference in the salaries of staff and workers in Meihua; and there are also inappropriate differences in the wage differences between workers. The determination of the salaries of Meihua employees is not based on a person's role in production, but on the closeness of their personal relationship with the capitalists. The base salary of an ordinary weighing clerk is 34 yuan per month, while the base salary of a general technician is only 14 yuan. An old technician who is responsible for repairing the machines of the whole factory also gets only 36 yuan. The teahouse attendants Yuan Qingting and Wang Changjin, in addition to sweeping the manager's office and pouring tea for the manager, get 15 yuan a month, which is higher than the 14 yuan of the tobacco cutting technician Chen Wenqing. What is even more unreasonable is that the gatekeeper Liu Zhonglian, in addition to watching the gate, searches the male workers' bodies and gets 20 yuan a month. These unreasonable phenomena should be corrected because they hinder the improvement of workers' production enthusiasm.

Speaking of this level, I think it is necessary to implement an extra reward system in Meihua. Now, the workers clearly recognize the difficulties of the factory, they take the overall situation into consideration and work hard to improve production without asking for increased wages. However, the capitalists should give spiritual and material rewards to those who have made significant achievements in improving production, improving technology, and saving raw materials, in order to improve the workers' labor enthusiasm and production initiative.

Finally, several cigarette factories in Wuhan have a bad habit, that is, when a brand becomes popular, they cut corners and cheat consumers. Meihua should carefully avoid this old road of self-destruction of reputation.

### 一个私营工厂是怎样谋取正当利润的

　　一个私营工厂是怎样谋取正当利润的
    本报特派记者  萧航
    在武汉，有少数工商业者还留恋着过去通货膨胀的岁月，企图重温投机倒把的旧梦，对于改善经营则漠不关心。但是，也有一些从事正当经营的工商业者，一贯坚持生产，不靠投机倒把谋取暴利，在物价平稳之后也毫无亏损，而且生意越作越好。私营美华烟厂就是这些正当工商业中的一个。
  一、稀有的例外
    四月间，正当各业遭逢滞销困难的时候，在美华烟厂的门前，却整日拥挤着订货的顾客。当时，美华的“红美”牌香烟创牌子不久，质量比同级烟要好，价格又低，因而销路畅旺，达到了这样的程度：有些顾客因争先订货引起纠纷，经公安局调解始告平息。美华全厂的工人，常常为了大批定货而加班。因此，该厂四月份的产量就显得突出了些。以去年十二月份产三五六箱为一百，今年一月份的指数是一百七十四，二月份是八十九，三月份是一百零一，四月份则骤增至二百一十二，五月份是二百零四。说到实销量，除二、三月有些降低外，四、五月份亦已倍增。以去年十二月份实销四一○箱（内有上月结存的一部分）为一百，今年一月份为一百二十一，二月份为九十八，三月份为七十五，四月份为一百九十八，五月份为一百六十八。
    直到现在，美华的经理还保守着他的营业秘密，所以他究竟赚了多少钱，还很难作准确的计算。据工会的同志谈，四月份每箱烟估计能赚十五万元，全月实销八百一十四箱，共可赚一亿二千二百一十万元。在各货滞销，有些工厂、商店发生严重困难的时候，美华能赚这么多钱，在武汉全市来说，实是稀有的例外。
  二、没有特别的奥妙
    大家全说美华经营有道，但是不是说有特别的奥妙呢？没有。如果有的话，就是经营态度比较老实些。
    去年五月武汉解放以后，美华即改制中下级香烟，以供应武汉周围的农村。经过一年的努力，在武汉以南、九江以北，美华已经取得了广大的固定市场。
    为了适应当前的农村购买力，美华废除了纸烟的不必要装璜，仅钢精纸的代用品一项，即使每箱成本降低五万七千五百元。在保证质量的条件下，香料的成本也有相当的降低。兴汉烟厂的“大武汉”牌烟，较美华的“红美牌”烟为次，前者每箱花香料费一万二千元，后者仅需八千元。
    人员配备比较合理，也是使成本较低的重要因素。美华全厂有二百二十名左右的工人，职员仅十六人，还包括经理在内，相当工人总数的百分之七。其他烟厂，情形就不相同。如南明烟厂的职员，占了工人的百分之十五。宇宙烟厂有职工四百零六个人，如果依照美华的编制调整一下，可减少四分之一。这样，仅直接工和间接工的开支，在宇宙厂的“圆球”牌烟的成本中，就占了百分之四·六，兴汉厂的“大武汉”牌烟也占了百分之四·五，南洋公司的“荣花”牌烟则占了百分之五·二，而美华的“红美”牌烟仅占百分之三·五。
    该厂经理徐荣杰，是烟厂技师出身，从十六岁起就干这一行，既懂得机器，又熟悉全部生产过程，更要紧的是经常到车间去，同工人一块研究技术。如果外面的事情不多，他每天至少有一两个小时在工厂里。这比一般厂主既不懂管理生产，又不愿下厂，就好得多了。本来，美华的出品，曾有一段时间是：烟丝既粗，又有空头。后来，徐荣杰和工人研究了一番，免除了这些毛病，并且把纸烟的松紧度作了适宜的调整，遂使成品质量提高。
    徐荣杰在经营方法上有一个好处，即在通货膨胀期间，没有支空借债，囤积投机。原料购进与使用的统计数字可以说明这一点。从一九四九年十二月到今年五月，共购进烟叶四一三、三四九斤，用了四○○、三一八斤；购进四千米卷纸二、一一○盘，用了二、一七二·五盘（有去年十一月结存的一部分在内）；购进六千米卷纸三八○盘，用了三八○盘。按照市税局驻在该厂人员的统计表逐月核对一下，就会发现确如武汉市总工会所调查的：“美华烟厂的原料是随购随用，进价随市场价格涨落而进，出售随市场价格涨落而销，结果赚了钱。”有的烟厂，预先囤积了大批烟叶，物价一落，亏本还卖不出去。这种情况几乎遍及各厂。据市工商局估计，全武汉市在物价下降的两三个月内，由于重货轻币所招致的损失在二百亿元以上。而美华却避免了这种损失。
  三、并不是没有毛病
    美华的经理并不了解，任何企业，如果不是倚靠工人，而仅仅倚靠企业主自己的努力，是不可能搞好的。美华也不是例外。当今年二、三月间，美华出品遭逢滞销的时候，是工人背起纸烟，到处推销，才打开销路的。而在当时，资方却表现了束手无策。工人以国家主人翁的身份，努力节约，自制包装用的浆糊，一天就给资方节省五万元。而更卓越的成绩，则是创造了全市盘纸的最高使用量。解放前，美华的四千米卷纸每盘出烟四八、五二六支，现在则出五六、八七六支。而公营的南洋兄弟烟草公司，每盘只出五二、六三二支，宇宙烟厂则仅出五一、○○○支。但是，资方对于工人在生产中的决定作用，并没有清楚的认识。因而劳资关系还没有达到更团结的地步。所以迅速成立劳资协商会议，解决有关生产的各项问题，乃是美华提高生产的要着。同时，该厂现在还保存下来的侮辱工人人格的“搜身制”，更是必须废除。
    另一个毛病是美华职员与工人间的工薪存在着不合理的差别；而且工人之间的工资差额也颇有不适当之处。美华职工工薪的确定，不是按照一个人在生产中的作用，而是凭恃与资方私人关系的亲疏。一个普通的过磅的职员，底薪是每月三十四元，一般技工则仅十四元。一个负责修理全厂机器的老技工，也只三十六元。茶房袁清廷、王昌金，除了给经理室扫扫地，就是给经理倒倒茶，一月十五元，比切烟技工陈文清的十四元还高。更不合理的是：门房刘忠廉，除了看看门，就是搜男工的身，一月竟拿二十元。这些不合理的现象之所以应该纠正，就是因为它阻挠着工人生产积极性的提高。
    说到这一层，我认为在美华实行一种超额奖励制是必要的。现在，工人清楚地认识到工厂的困难，他们顾全大体，努力提高生产，而不要求增加工资。但是，对提高生产、改进技术、节约原料等著有显著成绩者，资方应该予以精神的与物质的奖励，好提高工人的劳动热情和生产的积极性。
    最后，武汉的若干烟厂有一种恶习，即当一种牌子打响之后，就偷工减料，坑骗消费者。美华应谨慎地避免这条自毁声誉的旧路。
