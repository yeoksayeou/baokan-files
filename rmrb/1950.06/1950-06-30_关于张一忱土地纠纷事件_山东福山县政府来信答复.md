Regarding the Zhang Yichen Land Dispute
Reply from the Fushan County Government of Shandong

To the Editors:

    Zhang Yichen's letter, published in People's Forum on April 27th, criticized our county for improperly handling his land and housing. This is helpful to our work. We are now informing you of the results of our investigation and handling of the situation.

    Comrade Zhang Yichen went away to do business twenty years ago, and joined the revolutionary work in 1934. For more than twenty years, his family did not receive any information from him. When his wife remarried in 1947, she handed over three houses and five mu of land to the village government for disposal, and a deed of dedication was drawn up. During the land reform, the village government distributed this land to the masses as property of a family with no living heir (the houses were not distributed). In the autumn of 1949, Comrade Zhang Yichen returned from the convalescent home of the North China Military Region and asked the village cadres to restore his property rights. However, the village cadres thought that the land had already been distributed, and they would only be able to find a way to solve the land and housing problem for him after Zhang returned home to engage in production. Comrade Zhang then returned to the convalescent home. Later, after the hospital sent three letters asking us to solve this problem, we sent someone to the village to handle it. The village cadres insisted on their original opinion, so we replied to the convalescent home based on the village cadres' opinion, and asked them to inform Comrade Zhang Yichen.

    Our handling of this issue was inappropriate. Because Comrade Zhang Yichen is a revolutionary soldier and of middle peasant status, his land should be returned to him. Because we unconditionally accommodated the opinions of the village cadres, his land problem was not resolved. We fully accept the criticism of us by Comrade Zhang Yichen and the newspaper. Zhang Yichen's land and houses should have been returned immediately. However, because the land has been distributed to farmers for cultivation, the official handover must wait until after the autumn harvest, so that the land recipients can harvest the crops on the land. As for the land problem of the farmers who were allocated Zhang Yichen's land, it must also be resolved when the land rights are determined. The houses, because they were not distributed, should be handed over immediately. After Comrade Zhang Yichen recovers his land and houses, he is entirely free to decide who to entrust with their management.

　　关于张一忱土地纠纷事件
    山东福山县政府来信答复编辑同志：
    人民园地四月二十七日发表了张一忱同志的信，批评本县处理他的土地房屋不当。这对于我们的工作是有帮助的。兹将我们调查处理的情况告诉你们。
    张一忱同志于二十年前外出经商，一九三四年参加革命工作。前后二十余年家中没有接到过他的信息。他的妻子于一九四七年改嫁时，把三间房屋五亩土地交与村政府处理，并立献契一张。土地改革时，村政府即将这份土地按绝户地分给群众（房子没分）。一九四九年秋，张一忱同志由华北军区疗养院归来，要求村干部恢复其产权。但村干部以为土地已经分了，只有等张回家生产后替他设法解决土地及房屋问题。张同志即回到疗养院。后经该院三次来信要我们解决这一问题。我们曾派人到该村处理这一问题。村干部坚持原来意见，我们就根据村干部意见，回答了疗养院；并请转告张一忱同志。
    我们对这一问题的处理，是不妥当的。因为张一忱同志是一位革命军人，又是中农成份，自应发还他的土地。因为我们无原则地迁就村干部的意见，使他的土地问题未得解决。我们完全接受张一忱同志及报纸对我们的批评。张一忱同志的土地房屋本应立即归还。但因土地已分给农民耕作，正式移交须待秋收以后，让得地户把地上作物收回去。至于分得张一忱同志土地的农民的土地问题，也须在确定地权时一并解决。房屋因未分配，当即行移交。张一忱同志收回自己的土地房屋后，委托何人代管，全由张同志自己决定。
