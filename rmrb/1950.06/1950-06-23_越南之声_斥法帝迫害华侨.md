　　"Voice of Vietnam" Condemns French Imperialists' Persecution of Overseas Chinese
    Points out that this is part of a massive plan by the French imperialists, acting on the orders of the imperialists, to persecute Overseas Chinese. To resist oppression, Overseas Chinese and the Vietnamese people will unite more closely!
    [Xinhua News Agency, dated 22nd] According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency in North Vietnam: The "Voice of Vietnam" radio broadcast on the 16th denounced the atrocities committed by French colonialists against Overseas Chinese students in Cho Lon not long ago. The broadcast, after recounting the incident where French police searched Fujian School on May 6th, arrested more than 70 students, injured several on the spot, and the tragic murder of female student Chen Peiji, stated that such acts of terror have occurred more than once since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The French colonialists' intensification of terror against Overseas Chinese in French-occupied areas of Vietnam is part of their massive plan to suppress the rising struggle of the Vietnamese people, and it is also part of a massive plan by all reactionary governments, acting on the orders of international imperialism, to persecute Overseas Chinese. The recent persecution of Overseas Chinese students by the French colonialists proves that Overseas Chinese in Indochina are fighting against French oppression, which will promote a closer unity between Overseas Chinese and the Vietnamese people.

　　“越南之声”斥法帝迫害华侨
    指出这是法帝奉帝国主义之命迫害华侨的庞大计划的一部分。为了反抗压迫，华侨与越南人民将更加密切地团结起来！
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：《越南之声》电台十六日广播斥责法国殖民者于不久以前在堤岸迫害华侨学生的暴行。广播在追述法国警察于五月六日搜查福建学校，捕去学生七十余人，并当场殴伤数人，及女生陈佩姬惨遭虐杀的事件后称，自中华人民共和国成立以来，这种恐怖行动已非一次。法国殖民者加紧对越南法占区华侨的恐怖行动，是他们压制日益增涨的越南人民斗争的庞大计划的一部分，也是一切反动政府奉国际帝国主义之命迫害华侨的庞大计划的一部分。法国殖民者最近对华侨学生的迫害，证明印度支那的华侨正为反抗法国的压制而斗争，这将促使华侨与越南人民更加密切地团结起来。
