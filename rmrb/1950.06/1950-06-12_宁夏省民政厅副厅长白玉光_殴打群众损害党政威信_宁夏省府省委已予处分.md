　　Bai Yuguang, Deputy Director of the Ningxia Provincial Department of Civil Affairs
    Assaults the People, Damaging the Party and Government's Prestige; Ningxia Provincial Government and Provincial Party Committee Have Already Punished Him
    Bai Yuguang, Deputy Director of the Ningxia Provincial People's Government Department of Civil Affairs (a member of the Chinese Communist Party), violated discipline and beat and scolded the masses in Helan County in late April while assisting local cadres in carrying out grain requisition work. The Ningxia Provincial Government has issued a circular criticizing him, and the Ningxia Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has also decided to give him a public warning within the Party. In April of this year, he led a work team to the second and fifth townships of the third district of Helan County to assist local cadres in grain requisition work. At that time, because a small number of backward people resisted handing over public grain, Comrade Bai Yuguang did not patiently persuade and educate them but instead adopted simple and crude methods, beating three middle peasants, Wang Zhao, Liang Xiang, and others. The occurrence of this incident not only aroused dissatisfaction among the local people but also fueled the bad habit of some cadres in Helan County of beating and scolding the masses, seriously damaging the political prestige of the People's Government among all ethnic groups. After the help of the Party group of the Ningxia Provincial Government, Comrade Bai Yuguang gradually realized the seriousness of his mistakes. In addition to conducting a profound self-criticism at the Party meeting, he also wrote a written review. In his review, he said: "After I hit people, I also said at the joint meeting of the Helan County District Committee Secretaries: 'Although hitting people violates policies and laws, it is still rewarding. Individual bad elements who resist handing over public grain can be beaten.' This not only caused great damage to the political prestige of the Party and the People's Government but also left an extremely bad influence on the county, district, township cadres, and the broad masses. I am an intellectual from a petty-bourgeois family with poor political cultivation and insufficient training in practical work. Therefore, there is a strong non-proletarian consciousness in my thinking, especially individual heroism, arrogance, and self-righteousness, and a lack of careful consideration of problems and a highly responsible working spirit for the people, thus causing the serious mistake of hitting people. Now, this crude style of violating laws, infringing on human rights, still exists relatively seriously among some of our cadres. In order to educate me personally and other comrades who violate laws and discipline, I request the provincial government and the Party to give me the punishment I deserve to raise awareness. Now, in addition to sincerely expressing my apology to the three beaten farmers, I guarantee that I will work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the future, improve my policy theory level, and conscientiously be a loyal orderly for the cause of the Party and the people."

　　宁夏省民政厅副厅长白玉光
    殴打群众损害党政威信  宁夏省府省委已予处分
    宁夏省人民政府民政厅白玉光副厅长（系中共党员），四月下旬在贺兰县帮助当地干部进行催粮工作时，违犯纪律，打骂群众。宁夏省府已予以通报批评，中共宁夏省委亦决定在党内给予当众劝告处分。今年四月间，他率领工作组去贺兰三区二、五乡帮助当地干部作催粮工作。当时因有少数落后群众抗缴公粮，白玉光同志未耐心进行说服教育，反而采取简单粗暴办法，殴打了中农王昭、梁项等三人。此事发生后，不但引起当地群众不满，且助长了贺兰县某些干部打骂群众的恶劣作风，严重损害了人民政府在各族人民中的政治威信。后经宁夏省府党组的帮助，白玉光同志逐渐认识了自己错误的严重性。他除在党的会议上进行了深刻的自我批评外，并写了书面检讨。他在检讨中说：“我打人后，还在贺兰县区书联席会上说：‘打人虽然违犯政策法令，但还是有收获的。对抗交公粮的个别坏分子是可以打的。’这不但使党和人民政府的政治威信受到极大损失，且留给县区乡干部及广大群众以极其恶劣的影响。我是一个小资产阶级出身的知识分子，政治修养差，在实际工作中的锻炼又不够。所以在我的思想中存在着浓厚的非无产阶级意识，特别是个人英雄主义，自高自大，自以为是的傲慢作风，缺乏缜密考虑问题与高度为人民负责的工作精神，因而铸成打人的严重错误。现在这种违犯法令，侵犯人权的粗暴作风，在我们的某些干部中，还比较严重地存在着。为了教育我个人和其他违法犯纪的同志，我请求省府和党内给我以应得的处分，借以引起警惕。现在我除诚恳的向被打的三位农民表示歉意外，保证今后努力学习马列主义与毛泽东思想，提高政策理论水平，兢兢业业为党和人民的事业做一个忠实的勤务员。”
