The reply from County Magistrate Dong Yilin of Xiong County proves that the situation described by Li Jinghua, a military dependent, is entirely factual. We believe that the county government's handling of this case, in which Village Chief Yu Shoushu was dismissed for embezzlement and dereliction of duty, and ordered to return the embezzled corn, was the correct action. However, it should be strictly investigated whether Yu Shoushu has other acts of corruption or illegal activities. Moreover, the most serious part of this case is the village chief and district chief's unreasonable beating of an ordinary person who dared to speak out, and an elderly military dependent who should be given preferential treatment. Li Jinghua said that he was unwilling to hand over the remaining public grain to corrupt elements and those who harbored them, but wanted to hand it over to the county government, which shows his hatred for corrupt elements and those who harbored them. Village chiefs and district chiefs should deeply reflect on themselves, thoroughly correct their mistakes, and improve their relationship with the masses. However, they became enraged and used beatings to respond to Li Jinghua's accusations. Are such people qualified to be public servants of the people? This kind of tyrannical behavior is completely illegal. Such village chiefs and district chiefs should be punished by law. If they are Communist Party members, they should also be punished by Party discipline. We ask the leading organs of Xiong County to consider how to take more effective measures to educate all cadres with this case, and to thoroughly rectify the ideological style of the cadres. And continue to expose the criminal acts of elements who oppress the people, embezzle, and engage in illegal activities.

　　本刊对殴打李景华案的处理的意见
    雄县董一林县长的复信证明了军属李景华所说述的情况全是事实。我们认为县政府在这件案子的处理上，对于村长于寿书贪污渎职，加以撤职处分，并令其缴出贪污去的玉米，这是做得对的。但于寿书是否还有其他贪污违法行为，当应严格检查。而且本案最严重的部分是村长区长无理毒打一个敢于说话的老百姓，一个应受优待的年老的军属。李景华说不愿把公粮尾欠交给贪污包庇分子，要交到县政府去，这表示他对贪污包庇分子的痛恨。村长区长应如何深刻反省，痛改前非，改善自己对群众的关系。可是他们却恼羞成怒，用毒打来回答李景华的指责。这样的人够得上当人民的勤务员吗？这种横暴的举动完全是犯法的。这样的村长区长都应受法律的处分。如果他们是共产党员，还应受党纪的处分。我们要求雄县领导机关考虑如何采取更有效的方式，以这一案件来教育全体干部，切实整顿干部的思想作风。并继续揭发欺压人民、贪污不法的分子的犯罪行为。
