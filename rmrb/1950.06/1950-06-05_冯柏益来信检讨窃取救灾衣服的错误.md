　　Feng Baiyi's Letter of Self-Criticism for Stealing Disaster Relief Clothing

Comrade Editor:

　　Having seen the criticism published on May 16th in "People's Forum" regarding the "Cadres in the Fourth District of Yutian County Stealing Disaster Relief Clothing," this account is accurate. I am now writing the sequence of events and my self-criticism below.

　　On April 7th, the Fourth District Office received 1,200 items of disaster relief clothing from the county government. On the evening of the 9th, the district office secretary and two others were sorting the disaster relief clothing and privately selected better items. I happened to see this. However, I did not stop them from selecting items at the time. Instead, I entertained the idea of seeking personal gain and selfish advantage, and said to Comrade Yang Lianshan (the cook), who was sorting the disaster relief clothing at the scene, "Do you have a pair of smaller underpants for me to exchange?" Comrade Yang Lianshan replied, "Yes." I immediately exchanged a very bad pair of underpants for a very good pair. On the morning of the 10th, the district office was again sorting disaster relief clothing, and I took a pair of blue uniform trousers through Yang Lianshan. On the 11th, District Committee Secretary Comrade Cui Zhikai returned and learned of this matter, and pointed out that exchanging disaster relief clothing was wrong. He convened a district committee meeting and decided that all relevant comrades should return the clothing. I then returned the blue uniform trousers. As for the pair of underpants, it was difficult to find due to the large number of clothing items, so it has not yet been returned.

　　As a work team leader, my main task is to rescue the people in the disaster area and help them produce food to survive the famine. However, not only did I fail to empathize with the suffering of the disaster victims who lacked clothing, but I instead sought personal gain from the disaster victims, infringing upon the interests of the masses. This mistake is very serious. In addition to returning the stolen clothing, I have already requested punishment from higher authorities.

### 冯柏益来信检讨窃取救灾衣服的错误

　　冯柏益来信检讨窃取救灾衣服的错误编者同志：
    看到五月十六日“人民园地”登载的对于《玉田县四区干部窃取救灾衣服》的批评。这个材料是确实的。现在我把事实经过与自我检讨写在下面。
    四月七日，四区区公所由县政府领到救灾衣一千二百件。九日晚，区公所秘书等三人在整理救灾衣，便私自挑换好衣服。恰好被我遇见了。但我当时并没有制止他们挑换，反而起了找便宜、自私自利的思想，向在场整理救灾衣的杨连山同志（伙夫）说：“我换一件小裤衩，有没有？”杨连山同志答复说：“有。”我就立刻用一条很坏的裤衩换了一条很好的裤衩。十日午前，区公所又整理救灾衣服，我又经过杨连山拿了一件蓝制服裤子。十一日区委书记崔志开同志归来，知道了这一件事情，便指出换取救灾衣服是错误的行为。他召开了区委会，决议要各有关同志将衣服退还。我当时便把蓝制服裤退回了。至于那条小裤衩，由于衣服件数多，已不好寻找，故尚未换回。
    我担任工作队长，主要任务是抢救灾区人民，帮助他们生产度荒。但我不但没有体贴到灾民缺衣的困苦，反而从灾民身上找便宜，侵犯了群众的利益。这个错误是很严重的，我除了即将窃取的衣服退回外，并已向上级自请处分。
