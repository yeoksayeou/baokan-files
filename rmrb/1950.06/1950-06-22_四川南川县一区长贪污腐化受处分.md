A District Chief in Nanchuan County, Sichuan, Punished for Embezzlement and Corruption

　　Shi Jingdong, the district chief of Shuijiang District in Nanchuan County, Sichuan Province, has repeatedly engaged in embezzlement and a corrupt lifestyle since taking office in December of last year. The county people's government has removed him from his post and transferred him to the county for reflection. He has been given a serious warning as a disciplinary measure, and a request has been submitted to higher authorities to determine how to handle the matter.

　　Shi Jingdong is from Shandong, with a working-class background and a middle peasant family origin. He joined the Communist Party in Jiaodong in January 1945 and participated in local work. After 1946, he served as a district squad leader, district armed forces minister, and district chief. Because he was skilled in using landmines and brave in combat, he received two first-class "Explosion King" medals, three second-class medals, and five third-class medals in Jiaodong, along with five flags and a pistol. However, since the great victory of the national liberation war in 1949, he has regarded himself as a "hero" and believed that after so many years of participating in the revolution, now that victory had been achieved, he should enjoy himself.

　　Since taking office as district chief of Shuijiang District, he has indulged in extravagant eating and drinking, arbitrarily issuing notes to the granary to withdraw grain in exchange for pork, wine, and vegetables. On February 15th of this year, bandits harassed Shuijiang District, and some granaries in the district suffered losses. Shi Jingdong believed that since the amount of the loss could not be accurately determined, it would be okay to use a little more grain. Therefore, he boldly used a large amount of public grain, consuming a total of 6,396 catties of rice. Shi Jingdong also embezzled five liang of opium, eight silver dollars, two gold rings, and two bolts of white cloth confiscated from bandits by the district government. Except for the gold rings, which were preserved, the other items were exchanged for wine and vegetables for eating and drinking.

　　Shi Jingdong also formed a sworn kinship with Zheng Deqing, a local tyrant landlord of the sixth bao in Shuijiang District. Zheng Deqing used his second daughter, Zheng Zezhen, as a lure, frequently inviting Shi Jingdong to extravagant feasts. However, Zheng secretly colluded with bandits, obtaining information about the district's activities from Shi Jingdong and sending it to the bandits; he also frequently transported salt and bullets to the bandits. Some people in the district knew about this situation, but they did not dare to report it because Zheng Deqing was the sworn in-law of the district chief. Recently, after Shi Jingdong was transferred to the county for reflection, he secretly borrowed 120,000 yuan from Zheng Deqing. The higher authorities must give him the necessary punishment.

　　Editor's Note: Shi Jingdong's case provides a profound lesson. In the wake of the people's revolution achieving great nationwide victory, this lesson is all the more significant. Our cadres must maintain and promote the fine traditions of hard work and struggle in any environment. Taking hardship first and enjoying comfort later, diligently serving as a servant of the people—this is the true nature of a revolutionary fighter and the only way to earn the respect of the people. In addition to requiring the leading organs of Nanchuan County, Sichuan, to deal with this matter sternly, we hope that cadres in all regions will be vigilant and maintain the purity of their thinking at all times.

### 四川南川县一区长贪污腐化受处分

　　四川南川县一区长贪污腐化受处分
    四川省南川县水江区区长石京东，自去年十二月任职以来，屡次贪污、生活腐化。该县人民政府已把他撤职调县反省。先给以严重警告处分，并请示上级决定处理办法。
    石京东是山东人，本人是工人出身，家庭是中农成份。一九四五年一月，他在胶东加入共产党，参加地方工作。一九四六年以后，历任区中队长、区武装部长、区长等职。因他擅长打地雷，作战勇敢，曾连得胶东一等“爆炸大王”奖牌二个，二等奖牌三个，三等奖牌五个，奖旗五面及手枪等。但自一九四九年全国解放战争获得伟大胜利后，他就以“功臣”自居，认为参加革命这么多年，现在已经胜利了，应该享受享受了。
    他自任职水江区区长后，就大吃大喝，任意开条子向粮库支粮去换猪、换酒、换菜吃。今年二月十五日，土匪骚扰水江区，该区部分粮库受到损失。石京东认为反正损失的数目查不清了，再动用一点粮也没关系。于是他就更大胆地动用大批公粮，共用去谷子六千三百九十六斤。石京东又私吞了区政府没收土匪的烟土五两、银元八枚、金戒两只、白布二匹。除金戒尚保存外，其他物品都换酒换菜吃喝掉了。
    石京东又与水江区六保恶霸地主郑德清结成干亲。郑德清以次女郑泽珍作引诱，经常招待石京东大吃大喝。但郑暗地与土匪勾通，从石京东那里探听区上动态，给土匪送情报；并经常给土匪运送盐巴、子弹等。该区群众有知道这个情况的，但因郑德清和区长是干亲家，也不敢报告。最近石京东调县反省后，还暗中向郑德清借了十二万元钱。上级一定要给他以必要的处分。
    范统 
    编者按：石京东的案件提供了一个深刻的教训。在人民的革命取得了全国性的伟大胜利的今天，这一教训更具有深刻的意义。我们的干部在任何环境下都必须保持与发扬过去艰苦奋斗的优良作风。吃苦在前，享乐在后，勤勤恳恳做一个人民的勤务员，这才是革命战士的本色，才能获得人民的尊敬。我们除了要求四川南川县的领导机关严正处理这一事件外，并希望各地干部同志提高警惕，时时刻刻要保持思想的纯洁。
