    Opening of the Supreme Soviet Session of the Soviet Union

    The first session of the Third Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, elected in March of this year, solemnly opened on the 12th. The main tasks of this session are to elect the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, organize the Soviet government, report on the execution of the 1948-1949 budget, and approve the national budget for 1950.

    The Soviet Union's 1950 national budget, presented by Soviet Finance Minister Zverev, demonstrates the superiority of the socialist financial system over the capitalist financial system. The Soviet Union's 1950 budget has revenue of 432 billion rubles and expenditures of 427.9 billion rubles. This kind of national budget, which has a huge surplus after offsetting income and expenditure, stands in stark contrast to the huge deficit national budgets of imperialist countries, which cause great disasters for the people.

    This year's Soviet budget once again proves that the Soviet budget is a budget that completely serves the people, a budget that further improves the material and cultural life of the Soviet people. Two-thirds of this year's budget expenditure is used to develop the national economy and social and cultural facilities, and this expenditure is increasing year by year. Compared with last year, this expenditure has increased by nearly 15 billion rubles this year. The continuous increase in the funds allocated to the national economy and social and cultural undertakings clearly reflects the Soviet government's great concern for the welfare of the working people.

    This year's budget once again proves that the Soviet budget is a budget for peace. The Soviet Union has allocated necessary funds in the budget for national defense expenditures to protect the peaceful labor of the Soviet people. This expenditure accounts for only 18.5 percent of the total budget expenditure, and this expenditure is decreasing year by year. This year it is 14.1 percent lower than in the pre-war year of 1940, and 5.4 percent lower than in the first year of the post-war Five-Year Plan. This once again illustrates that the Soviet Union steadfastly pursues a policy of peace that is unanimously supported by the broad masses of people throughout the world. In contrast, the budgets of imperialist countries, headed by the United States, are budgets for preparing for war. For example, the military expenditure portion of the United States budget accounted for 22.5 percent of the total expenditure in 1939-40, and 68 percent in 1949-50. In the 1950-51 budget message already submitted by Truman, military expenditure accounted for 76 percent. From this comparison of budget figures, is there any room for doubt about who wants peace and who wants war?

    The full implementation of the Soviet Union's 1950 national budget shows a brighter future for a more prosperous socialist economy and a more fulfilling life for the Soviet people.

### 苏联最高苏维埃会议开幕

    苏联最高苏维埃会议开幕
    今年三月选出的苏联第三届最高苏维埃第一次会议，已于十二日隆重揭幕。这次会议的主要任务，在于选举苏联最高苏维埃主席团，组织苏联政府，报告一九四八——一九四九年度预算执行情况，以及批准一九五○年度的国家预算。
    苏联财政部长兹维列夫提出的苏联一九五○年度的国家预算，显示了社会主义财政制度对资本主义财政制度的优越性。苏联一九五○年度预算的岁入为四千三百二十亿卢布，岁出为四千二百七十九亿卢布。这种收支相抵尚有巨大盈余的国家预算，与帝国主义各国给人民极大灾害的庞大赤字的国家预算，适成鲜明的对照。
    本年度的苏联预算再次证明：苏联的预算乃是完全为人民服务的预算，乃是进一步提高苏联人民物质和文化生活的预算。今年度预算岁出的三分之二，都充作发展国民经济与社会、文化设施的经费，而这项经费正一年比一年增加。与去年度比较，今年这项经费又增加了将近一百五十亿卢布。拨作国民经济与社会、文化事业之用的款项的不断增加，明显地反映了苏联政府对劳动人民福利的巨大关怀。
    本年度预算再次证明：苏联的预算乃是和平的预算。苏联在预算中拨出了必要的款项，充作保卫苏联人民和平劳动的国防经费。这项经费在预算的总支出中，仅占百分之一八·五，而这项经费正一年比一年递减。今年比战前一九四○年减少了百分之十四·一，比战后五年计划第一年减少了百分之五·四。这又一次说明苏联坚决不移地奉行着为全世界广大人民所一致拥护的和平政策。与此相反，以美国为首的帝国主义国家的预算，却是准备战争的预算，例如美国预算的军费部分，一九三九——四○年度占总支出的百分之二十二·五，一九四九——五○年度占百分之六十八，在杜鲁门已经提出的一九五○——五一年度预算咨文中，军费竟占百分之七十六。从这一预算数字的对比中，谁要和平，谁要战争，这难道还有怀疑的余地吗？
    苏联一九五○年国家预算的全部实施，展示着社会主义经济更加繁荣，和苏联人民生活更加美满的前景。
