[Shenyang News] *Northeast Daily* reports: The state-owned grain depot in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, has implemented a dedicated grain storage responsibility system, greatly improving summer grain storage work. Initially, due to a lack of experience in summer grain storage, and the fact that a large portion of the grain had high moisture content and was prone to heating, all depot personnel, from the manager to the warehouse keepers, were busy turning and drying the grain all day long, but they were still unable to keep up. When some grain started to heat up, it was impossible to find a specific person responsible, because everyone was responsible for storing the grain, but there was no clear stipulation as to who was specifically responsible for that grain stack. After discussion by all employees, everyone proposed learning from the experience of the railway enterprise management responsibility system, dividing the entire grain yard into areas, and assigning specific personnel to be responsible for the storage of all grain stacks. Each grain stack was hung with a wooden sign indicating the grain type, quantity, moisture content, impurities, etc., and the name of the person responsible. All depot personnel, except for necessary staff, were involved in storage work. After the division of labor was clarified, work efficiency greatly improved compared to before, and the sense of responsibility of all personnel was also strengthened. When it rained, regardless of day or night, everyone braved the rain to check whether the grain stacks and warehouses they were responsible for were leaking. Some warehouse keepers even moved to the entrance of the warehouse to facilitate grain ventilation and watched over the ventilated grain at night. Currently, none of the stored grain stacks in the depot have any leaks, the grain yard is tidy and clean, and soil contamination is rarely seen. Over the past month, the moisture content of the stored corn, millet, and other grains has been reduced after turning and ventilation, and no grain spoilage has occurred.

[Further News] In order to strengthen summer grain storage and avoid mold and loss, the Anda Grain Depot organized a Grain Storage Committee from the second quarter, dividing all storage staff into inspection, storage, and measurement teams with separate responsibilities. Over the past two months, the moisture content of various grains has been reduced from 15.5% to below 14.2% through turning, drying, and ventilation. Currently, the highest moisture content of soybeans is 14.2% and the lowest is 12.8%; the highest moisture content of corn is 14.5% and the lowest is 12.8%; the highest moisture content of sorghum is 12.9% and the lowest is 12.6%. Various grains can now be stored for a relatively long period.

The daily work of the Grain Storage Committee of the grain depot is carried out according to regulations. In addition to being responsible for inspection and acquisition, the inspection team conducts a general inspection of the moisture content changes and other changes of each grain pile every morning and promptly notifies the storage team. All grains with a moisture content of more than 14% are turned and dried that day. After turning and drying each day, the inspection team inspects the moisture content again in the evening to decide whether to bag, stack, and store the grain or continue to dry it. The measurement team is in constant contact with the inspection team during the weighing of grain each day to study the moisture content and other conditions of the grain received, so as to notify the storage team for appropriate handling. Finally, the three teams hold a joint meeting in the evening to review the acquisition, drying, and testing of grain, study storage and handling methods, and decide on the work procedures for the next day.

　　黑龙江省克山、安达两地粮栈
    实行粮食保管专责制
    及时翻晒降低水分保证不坏一粒粮
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：黑龙江省克山县国营粮栈实行粮食保管专责制，大大提高夏季粮谷保管工作。起初因夏季保管粮食没有经验，很大一部粮食水分又高容易发热，弄得全栈人员从经理到保管员整天忙着捣晒粮食，结果还是忙不过来。有的粮食发热时却又找不出具体负责人，因为大家都对保管粮食负责，但那一粮垛具体由何人负责却没有明确规定。后经全体职工讨论，大家提出学习铁路企业管理专责制的经验，把整个粮场划分区域，所有各个粮垛也都规定专人负责保管，每一粮垛都挂有木牌，注明该垛粮食品种、数量、所含水分、夹杂物等，并写上负责人的名字，全栈除必要的工作人员外，都被吸收参加保管工作。分工明确后，工作效率较前大大提高，全体人员的责任心也加强了，遇有下雨时不管昼夜，大家都冒雨去检查自己负责的粮垛仓库是否漏雨。有的库仓保管员为了便于粮食通风，就搬到仓库门口去住，夜里看管通风粮食，现该栈所存粮垛无一处漏雨的地方，粮场整齐清洁，土粮也很少见，一个月来所存苞米、谷子及其他粮食经捣晒通风后水分降低，没发生任何坏粮现象。
    【又讯】安达粮栈为加强夏季粮谷保管，避免造成霉烂耗损，于第二季度开始，即组织了粮谷保管委员会，将全体保管工作人员分成检查、保管、计量三组分工负责，两个月来经翻晾倒囤、出风，已将各种粮谷水分由百分之十五·五降到百分之十四·二以下。现大豆水分最高为百分之十四·二，最低为百分之十二·八；苞米水分最高为百分之十四·五，最低为百分之十二·八；高粱水分最高为百分之十二·九，最低为百分之十二·六。各种粮谷已能作较长期的保管。
    该粮栈粮谷保管委员会每日工作均按规定进行。检查组除负责检查收购外，早晨即普查一次各堆粮水分升降及其他变动情况，并及时通知保管组。凡是水分在百分之十四以上的，当天实行翻晒出风。每天翻晒出风后，晚间检查组再检查一遍水分，以决定装袋码垛保管或继续晾晒。计量组在每天过秤粮谷中，随时与检查组联系，研究所收粮谷水分等情况，以便通知保管组适当处理。最后，三个组于当晚共同开会，检查收购、晾晒、化验粮谷工作，研究保管处理办法，决定第二天工作进行程序。
