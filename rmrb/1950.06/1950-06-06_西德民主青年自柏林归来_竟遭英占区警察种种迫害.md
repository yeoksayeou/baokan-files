　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 4th: According to TASS, on the evening of May 30th, ten thousand West German young men and women returning from the All-German Youth Assembly were forcibly stopped at the British occupation zone border near Lübeck by a large number of armed police. Many young people were injured by dogs released by the police authorities. The police authorities, under the pretext of a so-called "typhoid epidemic in Berlin," forced the young people to undergo strict "registration" and "medical inspection" before returning home. According to a United Press report, the German democratic youth are currently being detained at the district boundary near Hailingburg.
　　On the same day, in Hal's Tatt, an incident occurred in which two thousand young people returning from the All-German Youth Assembly were attacked by fascists and criminals. British military police stood idly by when the incident occurred.
　　People from all over Germany have protested the terrorist acts of the West German police against West German youth.

　　西德民主青年自柏林归来  竟遭英占区警察种种迫害
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：五月三十日傍晚，参加全德青年大会归来的西德青年男女一万人，在卢卑格附近的英占区边界，被大批武装警察强力拦阻，有很多青年并被警察放出的狗咬伤。警察当局借口所谓“柏林发生了伤寒传染病”，强迫青年们在回家前必须经过严格的“登记”及“医务视察”。据合众社消息称，德国民主青年们现被扣押于海棱堡附近的区界处。
    同日，哈尔的斯塔特也发生了两千自全德青年大会归来的青年被法西斯分子和罪犯袭击的事件，当事件发生之时，英国宪兵袖手旁观。
    德国各地人民纷纷抗议西德警察对西德青年的恐怖行为。
