Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 27th: According to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications, and the General Administration of News of the Central People's Government's decision on improving newspaper work, the Xin Hunan Bao in Changsha has strengthened its work on criticism and self-criticism in newspapers recently and has achieved significant results in actual work.

　　The newspaper adopted various forms in carrying out criticism, including editorials, short commentaries, editor's notes, editor's annotations, news reports, and readers' letters. The scope of criticism included rural areas, industry and mining, finance and economics, culture and education, and other aspects of work. According to statistics from the latter half of May, the newspaper published a total of twenty-three commentaries (including editorials, short commentaries, and editor's notes), nine of which criticized errors and shortcomings in various aspects of work. Critical reports were published in prominent positions on the front or second page six times. The "People's Life" section published many critical readers' letters. Readers' letters of greater significance to current central tasks were published on the news page, and other letters were forwarded to the criticized units and individuals, requesting them to respond. Among the ten readers' letters published on the front page in the latter half of May, four directly criticized government work.

　　The newspaper's criticism has generally aroused widespread attention from those criticized and society, and has played a positive role in promoting and improving various tasks. For example, the criticism of the CCP Nanxian County Committee's neglect of production leadership prompted the county committee to immediately examine and correct itself. After the newspaper published reports on the collapse of the Changbao Dike and the delay in the Zhuo Lake Dike Sluice Project, which caused flooding of fields, it not only prompted the relevant authorities to conduct a review, but also aroused attention in various places to strengthen flood prevention work. For another example, after the report on the excessive overtime work of the Hunan Electric Company was published, the company immediately stopped this inappropriate practice. Some readers' letters, after being published in the newspaper, played a good role in promoting the improvement of various tasks. For example, after the publication of a reader's criticism of the Native Produce Company for purchasing alum at excessively high prices, the company paid close attention and further systematically checked the shortcomings in various aspects of its business, striving to correct them.

　　However, some government departments and individuals still hold a negative and indifferent attitude towards the newspaper's criticism. In the latter half of May, the newspaper's "People's Life" section publicly published thirty pieces of critical writing, but only sixteen received responses. Of the seventy-seven critical letters forwarded by the newspaper to various units, only thirty-one were answered. Individual units even adopted a confrontational attitude towards the newspaper's criticism, mainly manifested in their inability to focus on the basic spirit of the criticism, emphasizing individual details in the report that did not conform to the facts, and denying the correct main aspects of the criticism.

　　In addition, there are also some shortcomings in the newspaper's own work: (1) Staff members, especially editors and reporters, still do not fully recognize the important role of criticism and self-criticism, and lack the spirit of adhering to the truth and being independently responsible when criticizing the shortcomings and errors in actual work. At the same time, some individual staff members are self-righteous when conducting criticism, which hinders the development of criticism and self-criticism. (2) Due to the low political level of the newspaper staff, they are still unable to grasp the situation comprehensively, so they lack a comprehensive perspective when dealing with problems, and there are also problems of one-sidedness in conducting criticism, or inappropriate proportions in analyzing shortcomings and errors. (3) They are still unable to consciously grasp the main links in the current work for criticism. Therefore, it is still unable to give full play to the greater role that criticism and self-criticism should play.

　　新湖南报采用多种形式进行批评
    引起被批评者和社会上广泛注意
    对于推进各项工作起了积极作用
    【新华社长沙二十七日电】长沙新湖南报根据中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定及中央人民政府新闻总署关于改进报纸工作的决定，在最近期间加强了报纸上批评与自我批评的工作，并已在实际工作中收到显著成效。
    该报在进行批评时，采用了社论、短评、编者话、编者按语、新闻报道、读者来信等各种形式。批评的范围包括农村、工矿、财经、文教以及其他各方面的工作。据五月份下半个月的统计，该报一共发表了二十三篇评论（包括社论、短评、编者话）有九篇针对各方面工作中的错误与缺点进行了批评。带有批评性的报道在一版或二版头条地位刊登的有六次。“群众生活”版曾刊载了许多属于批评性的读者来信。对当前中心工作有较大意义的读者来信则放在新闻版上发表，并将其他一些信件转交被批评的单位和个人，要求他们答复。五月下半月在一版所刊载的十封读者来信当中，有四封是直接批评政府工作的。
    该报的批评一般已引起被批评者和社会上广泛的注意，在推动和改进各项工作上已起了一定的积极作用。例如对中共南县县委忽视生产领导的批评，促使该县县委即时检讨纠正。该报发表了长堡堤溃决及卓江湖堤水闸工程迟延工程招致洪水淹田事件的报道后，不但促使有关机关进行了检讨，并引起了各地注意加强防汛工作。又如湖南电气公司过度加班情形的报道发表后，该公司立即停止这种不适当的办法。有些读者来信在报上发表后，对推动各该项工作的改进起了良好的作用。例如发表了读者批评土产公司以过高价格收买矾石后，该公司就很注意，并进一步有系统地检查了各方面业务上的缺点，力求改正。
    但是也有一些机关单位和个人对报纸的批评还抱着消极不理会的态度。五月下半月该报“群众生活”版公开发表了三十件批评文字，得到回答的只有十六件。该报所转寄各单位的批评信件共有七十七件，回答的只有三十一件。个别单位甚至对报纸的批评采取对抗态度，主要表现为不能着眼在批评的基本精神方面，而强调了报道中的个别与事实不符的细节，否认批评中正确的主要方面。
    此外，该报本身工作中也存在着一些缺点：（一）工作人员特别是编辑、记者对批评与自我批评的重要作用还认识不足，在批评实际工作中的缺点和错误时还缺少坚持真理与独立负责的精神。同时，也有个别工作人员在进行批评时，自以为是，使批评与自我批评的展开受到障碍。（二）由于报纸工作人员政治水平不高，尚不能全面地掌握情况，所以在处理问题时缺乏全面观点，在进行批评时也存在片面性的毛病，或分析缺点、错误时分寸不适当。（三）还不能有意识地抓紧当前工作中的主要环节进行批评。因此还不能发挥批评与自我批评的应有的更大的作用。
