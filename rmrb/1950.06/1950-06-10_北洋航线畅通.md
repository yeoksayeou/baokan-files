Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th—North China Sea shipping routes are now open and unobstructed. Currently, the six shipping routes of Tianjin to Dalian, Dalian to Qingdao, Qingdao to Lianyungang, Tianjin to Longkou, Andong to Yantai, and Andong to Qingdao all have ships running on schedule. Ships on each route generally maintain a cargo load of more than "half-load" (meaning the cargo volume reaches half of the ship's capacity), and the supply of goods is increasing daily. The opening of these shipping routes will greatly benefit the exchange of materials between regions in the North China Sea area.

　　北洋航线畅通
    【新华社天津四日电】北洋各线航运，现已畅通无阻。目前天津到大连、大连到青岛、青岛到连云港、天津到龙口、安东到烟台、安东到青岛等六条航线，均已有轮船按期行驶。各线船只载货多能维持“半载”（即载货量达到轮船容的一半）以上，且货源正日益增多。这些航线的畅通，将大大有利于北洋区间的物资交流。
