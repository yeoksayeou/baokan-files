    The Story of a Pencil
    Yu Zhen
    (Comic Strip) (IV)
    (12) I ran into the field and garden, hiding beside my dad. My older brother stared with wide eyes, anxious. The shopkeeper's face changed, and he wanted to settle accounts.
    (13) The accounts were written by them; they could add however many yuan they wanted. Back then, we couldn't write or calculate; we only heard the abacus clicking, and the blood and sweat of the three of us, father and sons, rolled into it. After a year of hard work, we still owed Xue You thirty yuan.
    (14) The Xue family also colluded with the police and arrested my older brother on the night of the third day of the third month.
    (15)
    August 15th, the Northeast was liberated. The landlords and local bullies were all liquidated. In 1946, the land reform took place, and my family was allocated land. I volunteered to join the army.
