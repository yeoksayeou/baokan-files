Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The peace signature campaign in Italy has been deeply launched nationwide. Residents of towns and cities most affected by the war are taking a leading role in the signature campaign. In the town of Marzabotto in Bologna province, which suffered a brutal massacre by Hitler's bandits, 4,400 out of the 5,064 existing residents have signed. The port of Livorno collected 50,000 signatures in two days. In the small town of San Giorgio di Piano, 520 out of 531 adults signed. In the city of Masia, 90 percent of the residents signed. In fact, adults in many cities have fully participated in the signing. On June 7th and 8th, 45,000 people signed in Rome.

The signing is most enthusiastic in factories. For example, nearly 100 percent of the railway employees in Calabria-Lucania have signed. Almost all workers at the Sigassis factory in Livorno, the Filam factory in Rome, and the Valentia shoe factory in Alexandria have signed. Local peace committees have been established in various enterprises. Four thousand five hundred peace committees have been established in Bologna province, three thousand in Genoa province, and two hundred in Ravenna, Emilia province.

The first conference of the Austrian Peace Congress opened in Vienna on the 10th. Despite the threats, terror, and intimidation of Austrian reactionaries, the Austrian movement for peace has become a truly powerful mass movement, and more than 300 local peace committees have been established throughout the country. According to far from complete statistics, approximately 400,000 Austrians have already signed the Stockholm Appeal. To celebrate the opening of the conference, the Free Austrian Youth League organized a "Peace Relay Race." Hundreds of young men and women are bringing thousands of copies of the Stockholm Appeal, already signed by peace fighters, to Vienna for delivery to the conference. Delegations from the Soviet Union and Poland have arrived in Vienna, and delegations from Italy, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Sweden, and other countries will also arrive.

Peace committees and groups collecting signatures have been established in many cities and residential areas, enterprises, groups, and organizations throughout Israel. The Israeli Peace Committee has received countless letters from all over the country. The nation's leading scientists and other scientific workers, novelists, actors, artists, and many celebrities have declared their support for the peace declaration. The Israeli peace movement has recruited representatives from various parties and several public groups, including the Israeli-Soviet Friendship Association and the Israeli Progressive Women's Organization.
