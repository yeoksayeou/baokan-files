Xinhua News Agency, 9th - The National Trade Union Production Work Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions concluded on the 7th. This conference discussed and studied how trade union organizations should lead the masses of workers in production, now that workers in major industries and large and medium-sized cities across the country have been basically organized. During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government made a speech, encouraging everyone to do a good job in production. Vice Chairman Li Lisan of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions delivered a report and a summary at the conference.

This conference determined the basic guidelines for trade union production work and mainly resolved the following three issues: (1) Trade union organizations in both public and private enterprises should make doing a good job in the production work of the masses of workers their central task. The conference made it clear that the idea held by some trade union cadres that engaging in production in private enterprises means losing one's class stance is wrong. (2) The basic method for trade union organizations to lead the masses of workers in production is to organize production competitions. Through production competitions, promote rationalization proposals, improve labor discipline, promote the formulation of production quotas, promote technical learning, promote the signing of liaison contracts, enrich the content of production meetings, promote democratic management, and promote the signing of collective contracts. Production competition is not a short-term shock campaign, but should become a regular way of life and work for the broad masses of workers; production competition is the basic driving force for accelerating the construction of a new China. (3) The basic link in leading the masses of workers in production is at the grassroots trade union organizations, and the focus of grassroots trade union organizations in leading the masses in production lies in the trade union groups; the production work experience of the Ma Hengchang Group of the Shenyang Machine Factory should be promoted throughout the country.

The trade union cadres from various regions attending the conference unanimously agreed that this conference not only further clarified the idea of trade unions focusing on production, but also clarified many confused concepts about doing a good job in production in private enterprises, and also provided a set of specific methods, thus having full confidence in doing a good job in the production work of the masses of workers in the future.

　　全国工会生产工作会议闭幕
    工会生产工作基本方针确定
    公私企业中工会都应以作好生产工作为中心任务，基本方法是组织生产竞赛，基本环节是在工会基层组织。
    【新华社九日讯】中华全国总工会召开的全国工会生产工作会议，已于七日闭幕。这次会议讨论和研究了在全国各主要产业、各大中城市的工人已基本上组织起来的情况下，工会组织如何领导工人群众生产的问题。会议期间，中央人民政府朱德副主席曾亲临讲话，勉励大家作好生产工作。中华全国总工会李立三副主席在会议上作了报告和总结。
    这次会议确定了工会生产工作的基本方针，主要地解决了以下三个问题：（一）无论公营或私营企业中的工会组织都应以作好工人群众生产工作为中心任务。会议明确指出部分工会干部认为在私营企业中搞好生产是失掉阶级立场的思想是错误的。（二）工会组织领导工人群众生产工作的基本方法是组织生产竞赛。通过生产竞赛推动合理化建议，提高劳动纪律，推动制定生产定额，推动技术学习，推动订立联系合同，充实生产会议内容，推进管理民主化，推动订立集体合同。生产竞赛不是短期突击运动，而应成为经常的、广大工人群众的生活方式与劳动方式；生产竞赛是加速建设新中国的基本动力。（三）领导工人群众生产工作的基本环节是在工会基层组织，而工会基层组织领导群众生产工作的重心在于工会小组；沈阳机器工厂马恒昌小组的生产工作经验，应该向全国各地推广。
    出席会议的各地工会干部一致认为：这次会议不仅更加明确了工会面向生产的思想，尤其是廓清了关于在私营企业中作好生产工作的许多糊涂观念，而且有了一套具体办法，因而对今后作好工人群众生产工作有充分的信心。
