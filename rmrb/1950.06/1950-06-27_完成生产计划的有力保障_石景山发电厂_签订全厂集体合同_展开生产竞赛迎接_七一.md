    A Strong Guarantee for Completing Production Plans
    Shijingshan Power Plant
    Signs Plant-Wide Collective Contract
    Launches Production Competition to Welcome "July 1st"
    [Our Paper's News] Reporter Feng Zhong reports: On June 1st, the administration and the trade union of Shijingshan Power Plant signed the plant's collective contract for June. This is the first plant-wide collective contract in a public-owned enterprise in Beijing.
    The first part of the contract is the production plan. It clearly stipulates the output quota, the load of the power grid dispatch, the quality (including voltage, frequency, power factor), the power generation (including the amount of power generated, the self-use power rate, and the actual power delivered), and the standards for coal and oil consumption. The production plans of major production departments such as the electrical field, the steam field, the boiler field, and the transportation field more specifically stipulate the completion date of a certain project, the required man-hours, and the responsible team and group. In addition, work plans have also been formulated for the Production Technology Section, the Cadre Section, the General Affairs Section, and the Planning Section. The second part is the responsibilities to be borne by the administration and the trade union, the guarantee matters, and the reward and punishment measures. The last part is the joint organization of a consultation committee by the trade union and the administration to resolve various problems that occur in the process of implementing the collective contract.
    When Shijingshan Power Plant overhauled High-Pressure Furnace No. 15 in March of this year, the trade union and the administrative side tentatively signed a collective contract, and the furnace repair work was completed three days ahead of schedule. The load exceeded the contract stipulations, and coal consumption was also reduced compared to the past. The administrative side awarded the workers 3,000 catties of millet in accordance with the contract stipulations. As a result, all the plant's employees had a preliminary understanding of the signing of collective contracts. When brewing the signing of a plant-wide collective contract in May, all personnel studied the relevant documents on collective contracts and the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and Northeast China. The administrative side and the trade union assigned special personnel to jointly draft the contract, send it to the higher levels for review, and distribute it to the employees of each field, workshop, and group for separate study and discussion. The workers put forward many constructive opinions. Workers in the steam field, electrical field, boiler field, and other teams put forward more than 100 opinions on how to reduce coal consumption and prevent faults. The trade union and the administration carefully studied these proposals made by the workers and revised the draft twice to make the contract content more substantial.
    Because the collective contract has been discussed and revised by the workers, the production plan portion has become the workers' own plan, enhancing the workers' sense of ownership and providing a further guarantee for the completion of the production plan. Of the plant's 79 employee groups, 60 groups, excluding non-direct production departments such as the general affairs section, have formulated group production plans. The boiler field, electrical field, steam field, transportation field, and repair field have also signed contact contracts through challenge competitions. Each group and team has also proposed challenge conditions. In order to launch a production competition, the trade union initiated a new record movement and formed a production competition committee, with the chairman of the trade union serving as the chairman of the competition committee. The factory director is personally responsible for quality inspection work. A propaganda and mobilization work committee has also been established to exchange production experience, commend model deeds and model employees, and criticize shortcomings in the work through big-character posters, blackboards, cartoons, and broadcasts.
    Machines are most prone to damage in the summer. After the power plant signed the collective contract for June, several faults occurred. However, due to the workers' active responsibility for production and their ability to play an active and creative role, all the faults were quickly repaired or properly handled, without affecting production. For example, on the evening of June 2, the insulation wall of Boiler No. 17 collapsed, which would have required the shutdown of the furnace for three or four days for repairs. However, after discussion and research by the workers, it was decided to brave the high temperature and enter the furnace to carry out emergency repairs, which were completed in just ten hours. On June 5, the steam pipe of Boiler No. 16 burst. The workers were divided into four groups, taking turns entering the 80-degree high-temperature furnace to burn oxygen and weld repairs, completing the work in two hours.
    The signing of the collective contract has strengthened the sense of responsibility of administrative cadres. In the past, the materials that the plant requested from the North China Electric Power Management Bureau were often overdue or did not meet the specifications. After signing the collective contract, the administrative side had to ensure that materials, raw materials, and tools were supplied in a timely manner and in accordance with standard quotas, so it took the initiative to establish a contact contract with the North China Electric Power Management Bureau. Sometimes, when the coal quality was poor, the factory director would personally run to the city to negotiate. Matters concerning labor protection and welfare raised by the workers, such as checking the health of employees and repairing workshops, are also being gradually implemented.
    After the signing of the contract, the Party, government, trade union, and youth league were more united and focused on production. The secretary of the Party general branch, the factory director, and the chairman of the trade union respectively took charge of the three major production departments of the electrical field, the boiler field, and the steam field, holding joint office every morning to study and solve problems in a timely manner.
    The plant has now launched a upsurge of production competition, and all employees are striving to complete and exceed the production plan to welcome "July 1st."

### 完成生产计划的有力保障  石景山发电厂  签订全厂集体合同  展开生产竞赛迎接“七一”

    完成生产计划的有力保障
　　石景山发电厂
    签订全厂集体合同
    展开生产竞赛迎接“七一” 
    【本报讯】记者冯仲报道：石景山发电厂行政与工会于六月一日签订了全厂六月份集体合同。这是北京市公营企业中第一个全厂性的集体合同。
    合同的第一部分是生产计划。明确规定了出力定额、电力网调度负荷、质量（包括电压、周波、力率）、发电量（包括发电度数、自用电率、实发度数）、煤耗及油耗的标准。在电气场、汽机场、锅炉场、运输场等各主要生产部门的生产计划中，更具体规定某项工程的完工日期、所需工数及负责的班和小组。此外，也制定了生产技术科、干部科、事务科、计划科的工作计划。第二部分是行政与工会应负的责任，保证事项，及奖惩办法。最后部分是由工会与行政共同组织协议委员会，以解决合同在执行集体过程中发生的各种问题。
    石景山发电厂，本年三月大修十五号高压炉时，工会与行政方面曾试订集体合同，修炉工作提前三天完成，负荷量超过了合同规定，煤耗量也较前降低。行政方面按合同的规定奖给工人三千斤小米。因之，全厂职工对订立集体合同已有初步认识。五月份酝酿签订全厂集体合同时，全体人员又学习了有关集体合同的文件，及苏联与东北的先进经验。行政方面与工会指派专人共同拟出合同草案，分送上级审查，同时发交各场、各车间、各小组职工分别研究讨论。工人提了许多建设性的意见。汽机场、电气场、锅炉场等各班工人共提出有关如何减低煤耗及防止发生故障的意见一百多条。工会与行政方面根据工人提出的意见，详细研讨后，曾作两次修改，使合同内容益发充实。
    因为集体合同曾经工人讨论、修正，使生产计划部分变成了工人自己的计划，增强了工人的主人翁的感觉，对完成生产计划，有了进一步的保证。全厂七十九个职工小组，除事务科等非直接生产部门外，有六十个小组订了小组生产计划。锅炉场、电气场、汽机场、运输场、修理场等又通过挑战竞赛签订了联系合同。各组各班也提出了挑战条件。工会为了开展生产竞赛，发起新纪录运动，特组成生产竞赛委员会，工会主席任竞赛委员会主席。厂长亲自负责质量检查工作。并成立了宣传鼓动工作委员会，以大字报、黑板报、漫画、广播等方式，以交流生产经验，表扬模范事迹及模范职工，批评工作缺点。
    机器在夏天最易损坏，发电厂签订六月份集体合同后，曾发生数起故障，但由于工人对生产积极负责，发挥了积极性与创造性，都迅速修复或作适当的处理，未影响生产进行。如六月二日晚第十七号锅炉保温墙坍塌，本需停炉三四天进行修理，但经工人讨论研究后，决定冒高温进炉抢修，仅十小时就全部修好。六月五日十六号锅炉汽管爆裂，工人们分成四组，轮流进入八十度高温炉膛内烧氧气焊修，两小时就完成了工作。
    集体合同的签订使行政干部加强了责任心。过去该厂向华北电业管理总局请购的材料，时常过期或不合规格。签订集体合同后，行政方面要保证材料、原料、工具按需要及时供应，及合乎标准定额，就主动与华北电业管理总局订立了联系合同。有时因煤质不好，厂长就亲自跑到城内交涉办理。对工人提出的劳保福利事项，如检查职工身体，修补工房等，也正逐步实施。
    签订合同后，党、政、工、团更团结一致，面向生产。党总支书、厂长、工会主席分别掌握电气场、锅炉场、汽机场三个主要生产部门，每日上午联合办公，及时研究解决问题。
    现全厂已掀起生产竞赛热潮，全体职工正以努力完成并超过生产计划来迎接“七一”。
