How to Handle Business Closure Issues

Beijing Labor Bureau Answers Reader Questions

To the Editor:

I opened the Ganxinghou Glass Shop outside Qianmen's Jingzhong Temple. Due to a lack of funds, the business situation is not good, and I have applied for closure, which has been approved by the government. However, I am unclear about a few issues and would like to ask for answers:

(1) How should severance pay be issued to employees? Some employees are now requesting that the remaining capital be split between the capital owner and the employees in a 40/60 split. Is this reasonable?

(2) How to prevent the entrusted manager from submitting inaccurate accounts?

(3) If some employees, after the closure liquidation, request the capital owner to provide furniture and premises to continue operating the business, can the capital owner refuse?

(4) How should the remaining capital (one hundred boxes of glass) be handled?

Wang Baiqing

Comrade Wang Baiqing:

Your questions are answered by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau as follows:

1.  Private enterprises that are closing down due to poor business or other reasons with government approval should pay severance pay to employees ranging from half a month to three months of actual wages. The labor side has no right to demand a split of the remaining capital.

2.  The manager is an agent entrusted by the capital owner, and the capital owner has the right to supervise and inspect his accounts and business operations.

3.  If the labor side wants to borrow furniture, etc. to continue operating after the approved closure and liquidation of the enterprise, it must obtain the consent of the capital owner.

4.  After the business liquidation is completed, the capital owner has the right to dispose of the remaining capital.

　　如何处理歇业问题
    京市劳动局答读者问编辑同志：
    我在前门外精忠庙开设干兴厚玻璃庄。因缺乏资金，营业情况不佳，呈请歇业，已经政府批准。但有几个问题不明了，请给予解答：
    （一）人员解雇费如何发给？现在有一部分人员要求将所剩资本按四六股与资方拆分，是不是合理？
    （二）如何防止被委托的经理呈报账目不真实的现象？
    （三）如有一部分人员，在歇业清理后，要求资方供给家具、地方，继续营业，资方能不能拒绝？
    （四）怎样处理剩余的资本（一百箱玻璃）？
                  王柏青王柏青同志：
    你的问题，由北京人民政府劳动局解答如下：
    一、因营业不振或其他原因，经政府批准歇业的私人企业，其人员解雇费应按工款发给实际工资半个月至三个月。劳方无权要求将所剩资本拆分。
    二、经理为资方委托的代理人，资方有权监督检查其来往账目及业务情况。
    三、批准歇业的企业，在清理后，劳方如果要借家具等继续营业，须征得资方同意。
    四、营业清理结束后，资方有权处理剩余资本。
