　　MacArthur Accelerates the Revival of Japanese Militarism
    Ten More Japanese War Criminals "Paroled"
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 26th] MacArthur, according to his "parole" method for war criminals arbitrarily formulated to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism, is continuing to illegally release Japanese war criminals. According to an Agence France-Presse Tokyo dispatch: MacArthur on the 24th again ordered the "parole" of ten Japanese war criminals, who will be released from prison on July 3rd. The ten war criminals "paroled" by MacArthur this time were all convicted of committing atrocities against Allied prisoners of war and citizens. They include Sugaya, a former lieutenant in the Japanese Navy stationed in Xiamen, and two others, who had committed war crimes in China during the war. Since MacArthur formulated the "parole" method on March 7th, he has successively "paroled" seven batches of war criminals, totaling forty people.
    Another dispatch: MacArthur's sixth announcement on the 16th of the "parole" of three war criminals, including former Lieutenant Colonel Sato, is scheduled to be released from prison on the 27th.

　　麦克阿瑟加速复活日军国主义
    日战犯十名又被“假释”
    【新华社二十六日讯】麦克阿瑟根据其为加速扶植日本军国主义复活而擅自制订的战犯“假释”办法，正继续非法释放日本战犯。据法新社东京讯：麦克阿瑟二十四日又下令“假释”日本战犯十名，他们将于七月三日出狱。麦克阿瑟这次“假释”的十名战犯，都是因为曾对盟国的战俘与公民施用暴行而被定罪的。其中包括战时曾在中国犯有战争罪行的前驻厦门日本海军中尉菅矢等三人。麦克阿瑟自三月七日制订“假释”办法以来，迄今已先后“假释”战犯七批，人数达四十名。
    又讯：麦克阿瑟于十六日第六次宣布“假释”的前陆军中佐佐藤等三名战犯，即将于二十七日出狱。
