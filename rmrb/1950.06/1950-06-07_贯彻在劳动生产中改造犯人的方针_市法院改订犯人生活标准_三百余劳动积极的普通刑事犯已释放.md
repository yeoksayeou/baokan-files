[Beijing Municipal News Agency] In order to implement the policy of educating and reforming prisoners through labor, and to encourage prisoners to actively engage in labor production, the Beijing Municipal People's Court Prison released 377 ordinary criminal prisoners who were active in labor and had preliminary awareness on the morning of May 31st. It also announced different living standard based on the degree of prisoners' participation in labor production.

In the past, prisoners' living standards were the same for everyone, one catty and four taels of rice per day. Some prisoners had the mistaken idea that "whether I work or not, I still get one catty and four taels of rice." As a result, they were not active in production, were lazy, and feigned illness. Some labor-active prisoners who did heavy work felt that one catty and four taels of rice was not enough to sustain their daily physical exertion, which affected their work efficiency. In response to this situation, the prison authorities have been implementing the following living standards since June 1st, according to whether or not they participate in labor production and the degree of labor: 1. Those who do not participate in labor production receive one catty and six taels of rice per day (an increase of two taels compared to the past, enough to eat). 2. Those who participate in factory production inside the prison receive one catty and twelve taels of rice per day. 3. Those who repair houses and build roads in the Summer Palace receive two catties and four taels per day. 4. Those who dig rivers and coal in Mentougou receive two catties and eight taels per day. 5. Those who burn bricks at Beida Kiln receive two catties and ten taels per day. This rational reform not only greatly improves the lives of prisoners, but also encourages them to actively participate in labor production in order to achieve the goal of reform and education.

　　贯彻在劳动生产中改造犯人的方针
    市法院改订犯人生活标准
    三百余劳动积极的普通刑事犯已释放
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民法院监狱为了贯彻在劳动中教育和改造犯人的方针，鼓励犯人积极劳动生产，于五月三十一日上午释放了三百七十七名劳动积极、有初步觉悟的普通刑事犯人，并宣布了按犯人参加劳动生产的程度而有不同的生活待遇标准。
    过去，犯人的生活待遇，是大家一样每人每日一斤四两米，一些犯人就存在着“干不干，反正都是一斤四两米，”的错误思想，因此在生产中不积极，偷懒，装病，而一些劳动积极的、干重活的犯人，则感到一斤四两米不够维持一日体力的消耗，因而影响工作效率的提高，监狱当局针对这一情况，自六月一日起实行，按照参加劳动生产与否，劳动程度轻重而给予不同的生活待遇：一、不参加劳动生产的，每日一斤六两米（较前增加二两够吃饱）。二、在监内参加工厂生产的，每日一斤十二两米。三、在颐和园修房筑路的，每日二斤四两。四、挖河的和在门头沟挖煤的，每日二斤八两。五、北大窑烧砖的，每日二斤十两，这一合理的改革，不仅使犯人的生活得到重大的改善，并可鼓励犯人积极参加劳动生产，以达改造教育的目的。
