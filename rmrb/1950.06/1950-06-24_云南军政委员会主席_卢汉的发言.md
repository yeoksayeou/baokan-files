Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd—The full text of the speech given by Lu Han (彝族 Yi ethnicity), uprising general and Chairman of the Yunnan Military and Political Committee, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 21st is as follows: Chairman, esteemed delegates:

    I feel extremely excited and honored to be summoned to participate in the CPPCC National Committee meeting. During the meeting, I was deeply moved by the great inspiration of Chairman Mao and the open and honest attitude and unified spirit of everyone.

    I feel very ashamed to be speaking here today because I stood on the side of the reactionaries in the past and committed many reactionary crimes. I have failed the country, failed the people, and especially failed the fathers and sons of Yunnan. My biggest mistake was sending tens of thousands of Yunnan's brave soldiers to the Northeast to fight against the People's Liberation Army, carrying out the orders of the reactionaries, and sacrificing them. Last year, when the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and advanced south with irresistible force, the hearts of the people across the country turned towards them, and victory was no longer in question. I was still stubbornly ignorant, unable to see the will of the people and the trend of the situation, wavering and indecisive. Before crossing the Yangtze last year, Chairman Mao announced the Eight Articles and Twenty-Four Clauses, and I already had some awareness, knowing that I had been deceived by Chiang Kai-shek and wanting to break free from the clutches of the reactionaries. Because the time was not right and the preparations were insufficient, if I acted rashly, I feared causing unnecessary sacrifice in the area, and as a result, I would have to yield to the reactionaries again. The uprising could not be launched, and instead, I sealed newspapers, arrested progressive elements, suppressed local partial liberation, and undermined the people's armed forces. After Guiyang and Chongqing were successively liberated, in order to preserve the country's vitality and end the war as soon as possible, and in response to Chairman Mao's call to perform meritorious service to atone for my sins, I led my troops to announce the uprising. War criminal Zhang Qun had already surrendered, but I let him go out of personal feelings, which was another big mistake. Looking back, everything in the past was truly a thousand mistakes, a myriad of sins. Only because I was greatly inspired by Chairman Mao, I finally had a considerable awareness at the last moment that I should turn back and repent of my past mistakes. I was responsible for the military and political affairs of Yunnan Province, and I could have turned back earlier, but I delayed and missed the opportunity. Because of my inherent ignorance and the difficult circumstances, I repeatedly committed many sins. I should take full responsibility for these sins. I would willingly accept severe punishment without complaint. Unexpectedly, Chairman Mao specially granted me leniency and instructed me to atone for my sins through meritorious service, giving me another chance to start anew and serve the people to atone for my sins. This is truly extreme leniency, making me extremely ashamed. Today, in front of the people's representatives, I frankly admit my sins and mistakes. In the future, I am determined to intensify my studies, strive to transform myself, and wholeheartedly serve the people under the leadership of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Chinese Communist Party, hoping to mitigate the mistakes I have made in the past and thereby atone for my past sins.

    During these few days of attending the meeting, listening to Chairman Mao's opening speech and the work reports of the various leaders, I have not only learned a lot of knowledge, but also deeply realized that the leadership of Chairman Mao, the CCP, and the Central People's Government is correct. The sincere cooperation in all aspects and every measure is based on the Common Program, and is steadily and systematically implemented. Chairman Mao said, "There are difficulties, there are solutions, and there is hope." After participating in the CPPCC, I have proven these words, believed in these words, and am determined to do them practically and unreservedly, and in practice, to further strengthen my unparalleled belief.

    The CPPCC Common Program is the common demand of the people of the whole country. It gathers the democratic talents of the whole country and is produced under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. This is truly a brilliant lighthouse. Among them, especially the land reform work is related to the fundamental construction of the country in the future. After listening to Vice Chairman Liu's very complete and detailed report, and after careful discussion by the delegates, it will be implemented in the future, and it can be guaranteed to be successful. I was originally a landlord. When I return to my hometown, I must explain and persuade in many ways, and fight for the realization of land reform. I myself will first give up the illegal rights enjoyed by landlords in the past. The plans and reports of finance, education, and the courts also focus entirely on the interests of the people and try to make major reforms. I sincerely admire and support them. Under Chairman Mao's forgiveness that allowed me to atone for my sins, I will do my best to faithfully implement the resolutions and serve the people.

    At this conference, I listened to the military report from Deputy Chief of the General Staff Nie. I am a military man myself, and in the future, I will sincerely and diligently assist in completing the demobilization of the Yunnan uprising army, police, and administrative personnel. The surplus personnel must be transferred to production, and the transformed troops must truly become the people's armed forces, quickly liberate Tibet, and eliminate the remnants of the Chiang bandits in Taiwan.

    At the same time, I am also a member of a minority ethnic group that has been oppressed in terms of ethnic status. In the ethnic policies of the Common Program, our minority ethnic groups have been truly liberated. We must thank Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. In the future, I am determined to devote myself to the work of minority ethnic groups, so that they can be more united, understand the New Democracy and ethnic policies, implement land reform, and seek the liberation of our minority ethnic groups themselves. I believe that in the minority areas of Yunnan, there are also differences in the degree of progress and backwardness. Regarding the Land Reform Law, I think that in some areas that have already progressed, land reform can be implemented in general. For the sake of the oppressed classes of the minority ethnic groups, I believe that the feudal exploitative Tusi system in Yunnan should be abolished as soon as possible.

    In short, my past crimes against the people are undeniable. From now on, I must study hard to transform myself and work hard for the New Democracy and the Common Program. As long as we rely on Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, China will surely have a bright future.

    Esteemed delegates, I am very grateful for this rare opportunity to shout here:
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the people's leader Chairman Mao!

    云南军政委员会主席
    卢汉的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】起义将领、云南军政委员会主席卢汉（彝族）二十一日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言全文如下：主席，各位代表先生：
    本人此次奉召参加政协全委会议，觉得万分兴奋和光荣。在开会当中，受到毛主席的伟大感召，看到大家开诚布公的态度，团结一致的精神，使自己更为感动。
    我今天列席发言，感觉得惭愧非常，因为我过去站在反动派的立场，做了很多反动罪行，对不起国家，对不起人民，更对不起云南的父老子弟，我最大的错误，便是把云南几万健儿，执行反动派的命令，断送在东北，和解放大军为敌。去年解放大军渡江南进，所向无敌，全国人心归向，胜利已无问题，我还是一味愚昧，看不清人民意志，看不清大局趋势，骑墙观望，摇摆不定。去年渡江以前，毛主席宣布八条二十四款，我已经有了觉悟，晓得受了蒋介石的骗，很想摆脱反动的魔掌。因为时机不到，准备不够，假如轻举妄动，恐招致地方无谓牺牲，结果，再向反动派屈服。起义发动不成，反过来还查封报馆，拘捕进步分子，镇压地方局部解放，摧残人民武装力量，到了贵阳重庆相继解放，我为了保存国家元气，及早结束战争，响应毛主席立功赎罪的号召，才率部通电起义。战犯张群，本已自投罗网，我以私情把他放走，这又是一件大错。回头一想，过去种种，真是千错万错，罪过万分。只因受到毛主席的伟大感召，自己到了最后关头，才有了相当的觉悟，应该回头是岸，痛悔前非。自己负着云南一省军政重责，可能及早回头。而迁延贻误。因为素性愚昧，兼之处境困难，以致反反复复罪过多端。这些罪过，自己应当完全负责，拿我重重惩办，我甘心情愿，领罪无辞。想不到蒙毛主席特别宽免，并责以戴罪立功，使我还有自新机会，向人民服务赎罪。这真是宽大已极，使我愧悔万分。我今天在人民代表面前，坦白认罪认错。今后决心加紧学习，努力改造自己，全心全意在毛主席朱总司令和中国共产党的领导之下，为人民服务，希望能够减轻自己以往所犯的错误，借以自赎前愆。
    这几天参加开会，听到毛主席的开幕词，和各位首长的工作报告，本人不但学得不少的知识，而且深切的体认到毛主席和中共及中央人民政府的领导正确。各方面的精诚合作，任何一种措施都是根据着共同纲领，稳步而有计划，有办法地去实践。毛主席说过：“有困难，有办法，有希望。”参加政协之后，使我证明了这几句话，信服了这几句话，决心本着这几句话，切切实实，不折不扣地去做，要在实践当中，更加坚强我这无比的信念。
    政协共同纲领，是全国人民的共同要求，集合全国民主才智人士，在毛主席共产党的贤明领导之下，才产生这共信共守的根本大法。这真是光辉灿烂的一座灯塔。其中尤其以土改工作，关系今后建国的根本。听到刘副主席非常完密周详的报告，又经过各位代表细心商讨，将来付之实施，一定可以保证成功。自己原是一个地主，回到家乡，一定要多方解说，劝导，为实现土改而斗争，自己首先放弃过去地主享有的非法权益。财经，文教，法院各项的方案和报告，也完全着眼于人民利益，尽量大兴大革，我衷心非常的敬佩拥护。在毛主席许我赎罪自新的宽恕之下。我要尽最大努力，忠实地去奉行决议，为人民服务。
    此次大会听得聂代总参谋长的军事报告，本人是军人出身，今后自当竭诚努力，协助完成云南起义军警及行政人员的复员工作，要使编余人员转入生产，改造过的部队，要真正的成为人民武装，迅速解放西藏，消灭台湾的蒋匪残余。
    同时，我又是向来在民族地位上，受到压迫的少数民族的一分子，在共同纲领民族政策中，我们少数民族得到真正地解放了，我们要感谢毛主席和中国共产党，今后本人决心致力于少数民族工作，使他们更加团结，了解新民主主义和民族政策，实行土改，求得我们少数民族自身的解放。本人认为在云南少数民族地区，其进步和落后也有程度上的区别，关于土地改革法，我以为在有一部分业已进步的区域，就可以一般的去实行土改了，为少数民族的被压迫阶级着想，本人认为云南的那种封建剥削的土司制度，是应该早日取消的。
    总之，本人过去反人民的罪过是无可讳言的，此后一定努力学习，借以改造自己，为新民主主义和共同纲领而努力，而工作，只要依靠毛主席和中国共产党，中国一定会有光明灿烂的前途的。
    各位代表先生们，我很感谢有这样一个难得的机会，让我在此高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    人民领袖毛主席万岁！
