    The First District People's Representatives Conference is Approaching
    People's Representatives from All Circles Have Been Elected
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The election of representatives for the First District People's Representatives Conference in Beijing began on May 18th and concluded on June 10th. Sixty worker representatives, fourteen representatives from government organizations and groups, five youth representatives, three student representatives, nine women representatives, two military and police representatives, three representatives of family members of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres, three cooperative representatives, and fifty resident representatives were elected, for a total of 149 representatives. In addition, there are 25 specially invited representatives and 8 government representatives, bringing the total number of representatives to 182 (originally set at 198, but the newly incorporated Chaoyangmen Guanxiang has not yet been handed over, making it inconvenient to conduct elections, leaving 16 seats to be filled in the next meeting). In the election process, the workers were the most active. Workers from the Production and Education Institute, the Revolutionary University Printing Factory, and Lihua Motor Works all participated in the election. 92.2 percent of the workers in the district's eleven public enterprises participated in the voting. The elections in private industries were also very lively, demonstrating the high level of awareness of the working class. The workers put forward slogans such as "Elect good representatives to discuss and handle the people's affairs with the government" and "Elect people who are enthusiastic about serving the people as representatives." Handicraft workers first discussed and deliberated on the qualifications of representatives among the members before conducting the election. Many Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists who are closely connected with the masses and have always been supported by the masses have become the targets of the masses' elections. Women were also very active in the residents' elections, with women representatives accounting for 31 of the 50 resident representatives. The masses generally responded well to this election, believing that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government can the people elect their own representatives without any restrictions. They said, "This kind of election is true democracy!"

    【京市新闻处讯】京市第一区各界人民代表会议代表的选举工作，自五月十八日开始，至六月十日已全部结束。选出工人代表六十名，机关团体代表十四名，青年代表五名，学生代表三名，妇女代表九名，军警代表二名，烈、军、干属代表三名，合作社代表三名，居民代表五十名，共选出代表一百四十九名。此外，有特邀代表二十五名，政府代表八名，代表总数共为一百八十二名（原定一百九十八名，因新划入之朝阳门关厢，尚未接交，未便进行选举，留十六名待下次会议补选）。在选举过程中，工人最为活跃。生产教养院，革大印刷厂，利华汽车行等单位的工人，全部参加了选举。在该区十一个公营企业工人中参加投票的为百分之九十二点二。私营产业的选举，也搞得很火热，表现了工人阶级高度的觉悟性。工人们提出了“选好代表，与政府商量办好人民的事情。”“要选热心为人民服务的人当代表”等口号。手工业工人先在会员中讨论酝酿了代表的条件，然后才进行选举。很多与群众联系密切，素为群众所拥护的共产党员、青年团员、积极分子都成为群众选举的目标。在居民的选举中，妇女们也很活跃，在五十名居民代表中，妇女代表占三十一名。群众对这次选举一般反映良好，认为只有在共产党和人民政府的领导下面，人民才能不受任何拘束地选举自己的代表。他们说：“这样的选举，才叫真民主哩！”
