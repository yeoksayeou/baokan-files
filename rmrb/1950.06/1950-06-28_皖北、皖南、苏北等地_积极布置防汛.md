　　Anhui North, Anhui South, Northern Jiangsu and Other Places Actively Deploy Flood Control

　　[This newspaper reports] Anhui North, Anhui South, Northern Jiangsu and other places are now making intense arrangements for flood control work. In Anhui North, the Yangtze and Huai rivers have risen earlier this year. The water level is only about two meters away from the newly built levee toe. Flood control work has become the most urgent task at present. The Anhui North Administrative Office has distributed all flood control funds (3.75 million catties of rice for the Yangtze River basin and 4.5 million catties of rice for the Huai River basin) to various localities; and instructed each special district that after receiving the funds, they must not be used for other purposes and should quickly purchase and store flood control materials, and store them in dangerous sections in a planned and organized manner. The Anhui North Flood Control Committee was established on the 16th of this month. The Anhui North Administrative Office has also instructed all special offices to immediately transfer cadres to establish flood control agencies to carry out all flood control preparations. The Chizhou Special District has changed the levee repair committee into a flood control committee and made preliminary flood control plans. At the Enlarged Water Conservancy Conference of the Chaohu Special District, it was decided that flood control should focus on the inland river levee line, and the Yangtze River should focus on new construction and dangerous sections. In flood control, communication and liaison should be strengthened to keep abreast of the situation and exchange experiences in a timely manner. The Lu'an Special Office is arranging flood control work in advance according to last year's flood control organization, and has begun to allocate cadres to prepare for organizing and mobilizing laborers.

　　The Anhui South Flood Control Committee was established on the 8th of this month, and the committee has established a flood control headquarters. At the first meeting, it was decided that the committee would hold regular meetings once every half month, and the headquarters would report its work to the committee once every seven or ten days, and report important situations at any time. The Anhui South Administrative Office, based on the general policy of flood control of the Central Government and East China and the actual situation in the Anhui South region, stipulates: "On the basis of levee repair and dike restoration, improve and unify the leading organization for flood control, implement comprehensive defense, focus on key points, be responsible at all levels, and guarantee in sections; implement public assistance, mutual support, in order to overcome floods and protect the safety of the dike area." In order to implement this policy, starting from June, flood control work has become the overriding central task in the riverine areas of the region.

　　The spring water conservancy projects in various parts of Northern Jiangsu have been completed, and they are now seizing the opportunity to inspect the projects and prepare for summer flood prevention. This year, the region's requirements for summer flood control work are: "In the Grand Canal, ensure that the dikes do not collapse at the 1931 flood level; in the Yangtze River, ensure that all the fields flooded in 1949 are completely free from flooding; in the Xinyi River, ensure that the dikes do not collapse, and at the same time pay attention to the reorganization of the original drainage system, and try to avoid or reduce flooding; in the coastal areas, existing sea dikes should be consolidated to ensure that the dikes do not collapse; in the inland rivers, strengthen drainage work, dredge small rivers, repair dikes and harbor dikes, and completely dismantle all open dams and hidden ridges, build culvert bridges, so that accumulated water can be discharged in time, and establish and improve culvert management agencies." The entire region will begin defense preparations on July 1, and is now working on organizational work and preparing equipment.

　　皖北、皖南、苏北等地
    积极布置防汛
    【本报讯】皖北、皖南、苏北等地现正紧张布置防汛工作。皖北境内今年江淮涨水较早，水位离新修堤脚只有二公尺左右，防汛工作成为当前紧要任务。皖北行署已将全部防汛经费（长江流域为三百七十五万斤大米，淮河流域为四百五十万市斤大米）分发各地；并指示各专区于领到经费后，绝对不能移作他用，应迅即购存防汛材料，有计划有组织地贮存在险要地段。皖北防汛委员会于本月十六日成立。皖北行署并已训令各专署立即抽调干部，成立防汛机构，进行一切防汛准备。池州专区已将修堤委员会改成防汛委员会，作出初步防汛计划。巢湖专区水利扩大会上，决定防汛以内河堤线为重点，长江以新工与险要地段为重点，在防汛中并要加强通讯联络，以便及时掌握情况，交流经验。六安专署按去年防汛组织，提前布置防汛工作，开始配备干部，准备组织和动员民工。
    皖南防汛委员会已于本月八日成立，委员会下设防汛指挥部。在首次会议上，决定委员会每半月举行例会一次，指挥部每七天或十天向委员会报告工作一次，紧要情况则随时报告。皖南行署并根据中央、华东防汛的总方针和皖南区的实际情况，规定：“在修堤复圩的基础上，健全并统一防汛的领导机构，实行全面防守，重点掌握，逐级负责，分段保证；实行民办公助，互相支援，以期战胜洪水，保障圩区安全。”为了贯彻这一方针，从六月份起，防汛工作已成为该区沿江河地区压倒一切的中心任务。
    苏北各地春修水利工程已经结束，现正抓紧时机，检验工程准备夏防。该区今年对夏季防汛工作的要求是：“在运河方面，要确保一九三一年的洪水位堤不溃决；在长江方面，要确保一九四九年被淹田亩全部免除水患；在新沂河方面，要确保堤不溃决，同时注意原有排水系统的整理，尽量做到避免或减少水患；在沿海方面，已有海堤要注意固堤，确保堤不溃决；在内河方面，加强排水工作，疏浚小河，修理圩堤港堤，并将所有明坝暗埂彻底拆除，修建涵闸桥梁，使积水及时排除，并建立与健全涵闸管理机构。”全区将在七月一日全部开始设防，现正着手进行组织工作和准备器材。
