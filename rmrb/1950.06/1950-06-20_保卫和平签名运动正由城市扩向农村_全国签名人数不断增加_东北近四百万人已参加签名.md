Xinhua News Agency report and Northeast Daily news: The domestic signature campaign to defend world peace is progressing enthusiastically, with the number of signatures increasing in various regions. Moreover, this movement is expanding from cities to rural areas.

    Northeast

Since the signature campaign in the Northeast provinces and cities was widely launched in mid-May, according to incomplete statistics from Jilin and Songjiang Provinces, the Lüda area, and Shenyang, Anshan, Jinzhou, Andong, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Siping, Chengde, Qiqihar, Ulanhot, and other places, the number of signatures has reached over 3.9 million. Among them, Shenyang City had 950,000 signatures by the 13th of this month, accounting for 60% of the city's population; Anshan City had over 165,000 signatures, accounting for two-thirds of the city's total population of 240,000; Jilin City had signatures from over two-thirds of its population; and the Lüda area had over 595,000 signatures.

In addition to actively participating in the signature campaign, workers unanimously expressed their intention to increase the strength of peace with practical actions. Of the 216,000 railway employees in the Northeast, over 203,000 have signed. Workers at the Mudanjiang Locomotive Depot have even made specific plans to increase production. Workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company stated when signing: "We must produce more steel."

Under the leadership of the Peace Congress branches or the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the signature campaign in various parts of the Northeast is being systematically expanded from cities to rural areas. In Fuyu and Yushu counties, Jilin Province, the number of signatures has exceeded 250,000, most of whom are farmers. In Lihe District, Yushu County alone, the number of farmers who have signed has reached more than half of the district's population. In the suburbs of Jiamusi City, Songjiang Province, and Jinzhou City, Liaoxi Province, with the promotion of propaganda teams sent from the cities, a total of more than 5,000 farmers have signed.

More than 100,000 people in various units of the Northeast Military Region have signed, and the signature campaign is expanding to units scattered across the region performing production tasks. Soldiers who have just learned to write also personally signed their names with unskilled strokes.

    Central South

In the Central South region, 400,000 people in Guangzhou City have signed. In various districts of the city, over 160,000 residents have signed at signature stations in streets, stations, and docks. Mr. Huo, a citizen blinded by Japanese invaders with chili water, upon hearing the propaganda team explain the significance of the peace signature, felt his way to the signature table and signed his name in his own handwriting. After writing, he said: "Many people were killed by the invaders. I lost my eyes but at least I didn't lose my life. We resolutely oppose aggressive war!" The number of signatures in Hunan Province has exceeded 730,000. The signature campaign in various cities of Guangxi Province is progressing enthusiastically, with over 48,000 signatures in Guilin City and over 42,000 in Liuzhou City, each accounting for about half of the city's population. The signature campaign is also developing in rural areas, with farmers responding to this movement with unparalleled enthusiasm after rent reduction. Among the 2,767 reader signatures received by the Guilin Guibei Daily within half a month, farmers accounted for more than 1,500.

In the rural areas of Yunyang, Yunmeng, Xishui, and dozens of other counties in Hubei Province, the peace signature campaign is being carried out enthusiastically. Almost all the people in Yunyang Town, Yunyang County, have signed. Farmers in Henan Province who have been allocated land are actively initiating signature campaigns at various gatherings. At a signature station in a certain district of Ji'an County, Jiangxi Province, more than 200 farmers went to sign in one day. In Binyang, Lingchuan, and other counties in Guangxi Province, signature campaigns are being widely launched among farmers through newspaper reading groups and forums to support world peace.

    Southwest

In Chongqing, the capital of the Southwest region, 930,000 of the city's 1.2 million people have signed. In launching the signature campaign, in addition to general publicity, the city has particularly widely adopted the methods of holding mass meetings and family visits; therefore, it has not only promoted a signature craze, but also improved the understanding of people from all walks of life about defending world peace and opposing aggressive war. Many activists, in addition to signing their own names, also mobilized the masses to sign. For example, Wang Youhe, a resident of the Xinsan District of the city, mobilized 3,631 people to sign. The number of signatures in Kunming has reached 120,000, accounting for two-fifths of the city's population.

    Shandong

In addition, over 70,000 people in Jinan City, Shandong Province, have signed, and 75,000 have signed in Xuzhou City. In the Zichuan-Boshan mining area of the province, 80% of the workers have signed; in Yantai City, which has a population of 100,000, half of the people have signed. In the vast rural areas of Shandong Province, farmers have also actively participated in the peace signature campaign. In Sishui County, Shandong Province, by the end of last month, 100,400 farmers had signed the peace declaration.

    东北各地在和平大会分会或中苏友好协会领导下，签名运动正有计划地由城市扩展到农村。吉林省扶余、榆树两县签名人数已逾二十五万，其中大多数是农民。仅榆树县李合区，签名农民即达该区人口半数以上。松江省佳木斯市和辽西省锦州市的市郊农民，在市内派出的宣传队推动下，共已有五千余人签名。
    东北军区各部队已有十余万人签名，签名运动正向分散各地执行生产任务的部队扩展中。刚学会写字的战士们也亲自以不熟练的笔迹签上了名。
    中南
    在中南区，广州市已有四十万人签名。该市各区居民在街道、车站、码头的签名站签名的即达十六万余人。被日本侵略者用辣椒水弄瞎了眼睛的市民霍老先生，听到宣传队讲解和平签名的意义后，即摸到签名桌前亲笔签名。他写好后说道：许多人被侵略者打死了，我瞎了眼睛还算没丢命，我们坚决反对侵略战争！湖南全省签名人数已逾七十三万。广西省各城市的签名运动正热烈展开，其中桂林市签名人数已达四万八千余，柳州市有四万二千余人，约各占该市人口的半数。该省目前签名运动并在向农村发展，减租后的农民以无比热情响应着这一运动。桂林桂北日报在半月内收到的二千七百六十七个读者签名中，农民就占了一千五百余人。
    湖北省郧阳、云梦、浠水等数十县的农村中，正热烈地进行着和平签名。郧阳县郧阳镇的人民差不多已全部签名。河南省已经分得土地的农民们，在各种集会上积极地发起签名运动。江西省吉安县某区的签名站，一天中就有二百多个农民前往签名。广西省宾阳、灵川等县，通过读报小组和拥护世界和平座谈会，在农民中广泛地发动签名。
    西南
    西南区首府重庆全市一百二十万人中，已有九十三万人签名。该市在发动签名的运动中，除一般的宣传外，还特别广泛地采用了开群众大会和家庭访问的方式；因此，不仅促成了签名热潮，同时还提高了各阶层群众对保卫世界和平反对侵略战争的认识。不少积极分子除自己签名外，并发动群众签名，如该市新三区居民汪幼鹤，一人发动了三千六百三十一人签名。昆明签名人数已达十二万，占该市人口五分之二。
