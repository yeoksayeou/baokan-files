People's Army Loves the People
    Letter of Thanks from an Old Man in Wuqing County

To the Editorial Comrades:

　　I am Gao Zigu, from Damogu Village, First District, Wuqing County, Hebei Province, and I am seventy-six years old this year. In the past, during the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, I was often beaten and scolded by them, but I didn't dare to say a word. Even the few liters of rice I had at home were snatched away by them. One year, they forcibly dragged me to build fortifications. As an old man, my movements were inevitably slow, and as a result, I was beaten. At that time, I was so scared when I saw them, I didn't know what to do.

　　Since liberation, we have finally turned over. We are no longer beaten or scolded, and we have the right to speak. Everything is done according to reason. It's really good! This year, the People's Liberation Army's 591st Regiment came to our village. They came here to farm and produce, and they also protected the dikes for the people, preventing floods. The 60-mortar squad of the 1st Company of the 591st Regiment lived in my yard. All fifteen comrades got up very early every day to sweep the yard and streets for the people. After returning from production, they would fetch water for the people, and the small water tanks in the people's homes were always full every day. After dinner, they would help us hoe the fields. We really felt bad about it. But no matter what we said, the comrades kept helping us with our work. This is a disaster area. Before the wheat harvest, my family had financial difficulties. The comrades were very sad to see me digging a little wild vegetable every day to make porridge. One evening, they held a meeting and decided to put together their allowances and bought me four dou of corn, solving my difficulties before the wheat harvest. I repeatedly refused, asking them to send it back to their families. But they all said, "The government takes care of our families!" This is the first time I have ever seen such an army. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu can there be such a good team. I can't express how grateful I am. I can only ask the editorial comrades to publish this letter in the newspaper to express my feelings!

　　Gao Zigu, Damogu Village, First District, Wuqing County

### 人民军队爱护老百姓  武清县一老翁来信致谢

　　人民军队爱护老百姓
    武清县一老翁来信致谢编辑同志：
    我是河北省武清县第一区大蘑菇屯村人，今年七十六岁。在过去蒋介石反动统治时期，我常常受到他们的打骂，但又不敢吱声。我家里虽然只有几升米，还给他们抢去了。有一年，他们强拉我去修工事。我是一个上了年纪的人，动作未免有些迟慢，结果挨了一顿打。那时，我看见他们，真是吓得了不得，不知道怎样才好。
    自从解放后，我们这才翻了身。既不再挨打受骂，又有说话的权利了。一切事情，都按道理去办。真好呀！今年我们村子来了人民解放军第五九一团。他们到这里来种地生产，又给老百姓挡堤，防止了水灾。住在我家院里的是五九一团一连六零炮班。全班十五个同志，每天起得很早，给老百姓扫院子、扫街。他们生产回来就给老百姓挑水，老百姓家里的小水缸里天天都是满满的。吃完晚饭，又替我们去耪地。我们心里实在过意不去。但无论我们怎样说，同志们总是不停地帮我们干活。这里是灾区。在麦收前，我家生活困难。同志们见我每天挖一点野菜来做粥喝，他们很难过。一天晚上，他们开了一个会，决定把发下的津贴费，凑在一起，给我买了四斗玉米，解决了我麦收前的困难。我一再拒绝，让他们给自己家捎去。可是他们都说：“家里有政府照顾哩！”这样的军队，我真是头一次见到。只有在共产党和毛主席、朱总司令的领导下，才会有这样的好队伍。我说不出要怎样感谢才好，只有请编辑同志将这封信在报上发表，把我的心意表达出来吧！
