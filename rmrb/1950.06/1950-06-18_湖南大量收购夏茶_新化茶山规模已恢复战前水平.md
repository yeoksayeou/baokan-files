　　Hunan Massively Purchases Summer Tea
    Xinhua Tea Mountain Scale Has Recovered to Pre-War Levels
    [Changsha News] According to the New Hunan Daily, Hunan has overfulfilled its spring tea purchase tasks. According to incomplete statistics from the Anhua branch of the China Tea Company and the Changsha office of the Central South District Company, the purchase of semi-finished black tea has exceeded the quota by more than 20 percent. Currently, various regions have begun purchasing summer tea. In addition to purchasing a large quantity of dark tea, it is estimated that more than 15,000 dan of semi-finished black tea can still be collected.
    Of the 77 counties in Hunan Province, 64 produce tea, with an annual output of more than 389,000 piculs. In the past, due to the long-term cruel plunder and exploitation by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, 80 percent of the province's tea mountains were deserted. After liberation, in order to develop agricultural production, solve the livelihood of tea farmers, and encourage tea exports, the People's Government established institutions, issued tea loans, and called for the restoration of tea production. According to an estimate from Xinhua County alone, in addition to restoring to the scale of the most prosperous period in 1935, newly cultivated tea gardens may increase production by 40 percent.
    During the purchase, the tea company set up many purchasing stations in various tea-producing areas. At each station, the number of people selling tea reached three to four thousand at most and at least three to four hundred every day. All localities democratically assessed tea prices, sweeping away the past exploitative practices such as "88% weight deductions, 80% quality deductions, and 50% cash payments." Therefore, tea farmers cannot express enough gratitude to the People's Government, and some want to send a few catties of good tea to Chairman Mao. During the purchasing process in various regions, in addition to allocating a portion of grain, edible salt, and other necessities to tea farmers, the state-owned trading companies in various regions also cooperated to sell a large amount of materials, which not only recovered currency and prevented local inflation but also effectively supported the vast tea-producing areas in helping poor farmers overcome the spring famine.
    However, during the purchase, due to the urgency of time and insufficient prior preparation, some tea farmers who came from afar had to wait four or five days before they could sell their tea. At the same time, in general, private merchants were not well united to jointly complete the purchase task. Many tea merchants hesitated, and a few bad elements took the opportunity to speculate and disrupt the work. These deviations have attracted the attention of leaders at all levels and are being corrected.

### 湖南大量收购夏茶  新化茶山规模已恢复战前水平

　　湖南大量收购夏茶
    新化茶山规模已恢复战前水平
    【长沙讯】据新湖南报消息：湖南各地收购春茶工作超额完成任务。据中国茶叶公司安化分公司及中南区公司长沙办事处不完全统计，已收购毛红茶超过配额百分之二十。目前各地已开始收购夏茶，除收购大量黑茶外，估计尚能收足毛红茶一万五千担以上。
    湖南全省七十七县中有六十四县产茶，常年产量为三十八万九千余市担。过去由于蒋介石匪帮进行长期残酷的掠夺和剥削，以致全省茶山百分之八十荒芜。解放后，人民政府为发展农业生产，解决茶农生活，鼓励茶叶外销，即成立机构，发放茶贷，号召恢复茶叶生产。现据新化一县估计：茶山除了恢复到一九三五年最旺盛时期的规模外，新辟的茶园，还可能增产百分之四十。
    在收购时，茶叶公司在各产茶区设立了很多收购站，每一站去卖茶的最多时每天达三、四千人，最少也有三、四百人。各地都是民主评议茶价，一扫过去“八八扣秤、八折扣实、五折兑钱”等重重剥削的花样。因此，茶农说不尽对人民政府的感激，有的要做几斤好茶送给毛主席。各地在进行收购时，除配给茶农一部分粮食、食盐等必需品外，同时各地国营贸易公司配合大量抛售物资，不但使货币回笼，防止了局部通货膨胀的现象，而且得力地支持了广大茶区贫苦农民度过了春荒。
    但在收购中，由于时间仓促，事先准备工作不够，以致有些远道而来的茶农，有等四、五天还不能把茶卖出；同时在收购中，一般没有很好地团结私商，共同来完成收购任务，不少茶商踌躇不前，少数坏分子还从中投机倒把，影响工作进行。这些偏差已引起各级领导上的重视，正设法纠正中。
