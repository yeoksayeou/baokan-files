Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The World Knowledge Weekly published today carried an editorial entitled "Protest Against U.S. Imperialism's Persecution of the Japanese Communist Party." The editorial, after listing a series of fascist persecutions by MacArthur against the Japanese people since May 30, pointed out that: although the target of MacArthur's persecution is centered on the Japanese Communist Party, which is widely supported by the Japanese people, it is obviously not limited to the Japanese Communist Party. All Japanese patriots who stand with the Japanese Communist Party and strive for democracy, freedom, independence, and peace are suffering similar persecution. This is MacArthur's general offensive against the Japanese people. This offensive demonstrates the revival of the Japanese police state.

The editorial emphasized that: The Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy documents on Japan clearly stipulate that all obstacles hindering the democratization of Japan must be removed, and the Japanese people's freedom of thought, speech, publication, assembly, and association, as well as basic human rights, must be guaranteed. However, MacArthur is now everywhere sheltering and supporting Japanese fascists who are obstacles to democracy and releasing war criminals in batches; at the same time, he is carrying out vicious oppression and destruction of the Japanese people's various freedoms and basic human rights. The Japanese people have the right to resist MacArthur's actions that violate the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy documents on Japan, and the people of the world also have the right to protest to MacArthur.

The editorial continued: MacArthur's persecution of the Japanese Communist Party is an attempt to clear the way for U.S. imperialism's wild intentions to reduce Japan to a colony, use Japan as a base for new aggressive wars, and prepare to use the entire Japanese people as cannon fodder. However, the Japanese Communist Party is by no means isolated; it is loved by the broad masses of Japanese people centered on the working class; the Japanese people are also by no means isolated, they have the support of millions of peace-loving people around the world.

The editorial concluded: Without expelling imperialism and overthrowing the Yoshida traitorous government, the Japanese people have no way out. We believe that the Japanese people have the power to expel imperialism and overthrow the traitorous government. No matter how MacArthur suppresses and persecutes them, the Japanese people, united around the Communist Party, will surely achieve victory.

　　全世界人民支援日本人民反对美日反动派备战阴谋
    “世界知识”社评斥美帝迫害日共
    【新华社十六日讯】今日出版的世界知识周刊，以“抗议美帝迫害日共”为题，发表社评。社评在列举自五月三十日起，麦克阿瑟对日本人民的一连串法西斯迫害事实后，指出：麦克阿瑟迫害的对象，虽然是以日本人民众望所归的日本共产党为中心，但显然并不限于日共。凡是与日共站在一起，争取民主、自由、独立、和平的所有日本爱国人士，都在遭受着类似的迫害。这是麦克阿瑟向日本人民总的进攻。在这个进攻中，表现出了日本警察国家的复活。
    社评强调指出：波茨坦宣言和远东委员会对日基本政策文件，都明白规定必须把阻止日本民主化的所有障碍清除，并保障日本人民的思想、言论、出版、集会、结社的自由和基本人权。可是，现在麦克阿瑟却一面到处包庇和扶植民主障碍的日本法西斯分子，并一批一批地释放战犯；一面对日本人民的各种自由和基本人权，则进行毒辣的压迫和摧残。对于这些违反波茨坦宣言和远东委员会对日基本政策的行为，日本人民有权利向麦克阿瑟抗争，全世界人民也有权利向麦克阿瑟提出抗议。
    社评继称：麦克阿瑟迫害日共，是想扫除阻碍美帝国主义要沦日本为殖民地、把日本当作新的侵略战争的据点以及准备拿整个日本人民当炮灰这些狂妄意图的道路。但是，日共决不是孤立的，他有着以工人阶级为中心的日本广大人民的爱戴；日本人民也决不是孤立的，他们有着全世界千万和平人民的支持。
    社评结语称：不驱逐帝国主义，不打倒吉田卖国政府，日本人民是没有生路的。我们相信日本人民是有力量逐出帝国主义和打倒卖国政府的。不管麦克阿瑟如何镇压和迫害，日本人民团结在共产党的周围，一定能够得到胜利。
