　　Cutting Mountains and Opening Ridges to Release the Yi River
    ——A Record of the Zhangshan Ridge-Cutting Project in the First Phase of the Yi River Diversion Project
    Gao Shan
    The most arduous Zhangshan Ridge-Cutting project in the Subei Yi River Diversion Project, which began on November 21st of last year and ended on May 20th of this year, has been completed in its first phase. This section of the project is located on the ridge north of Zhangshan Town, at the foot of the Ma Ling Mountains (the ridge is 23 meters above sea level), stretching five kilometers east from Xiaying Village at the foot of the ridge to the east slope. The New Yi River comes from the northwest, passes through Lake Luoma, and must pass through this ridge to reach the old course of the Shu River at Koutou. Therefore, only by cutting through this ridge can the task of diverting the Yi River be completely accomplished. To this end, between last summer and autumn, the local Communist Party Committee and the People's Government actively led the people in preparing for the ridge-cutting work. Engineers carefully surveyed and measured to determine the river line; the laborers transported grain and fodder on the rugged mountain roads. The project officially started in November. More than 27,000 laborers from Xin'an County, braving the severe cold and snow, completed the first phase of digging 520,000 cubic meters of earth in just 25 days.

    The second phase of the project began in March this year. More than 48,000 laborers from Xin'an and Suining counties, under the slogan of "Dig the River to Overcome Famine, Dig the River to Eliminate Floods, Dig the River for Ourselves," marched onto the mountain ridge. This section of the project was even more arduous than the first phase, having progressed from digging in the mud to the hard yellow soil layer and dense sand and gravel. The sand and gravel content was generally 60 percent, with a maximum of 70 percent. In the western section, there was a layer of solid sand and gravel half a foot thick. Using a pickaxe on it caused violent vibrations, sometimes breaking hands. Coupled with the lack of tools, some people were initially worried about the sand and gravel. However, under the slogans of "Eyes Fear, but Hands Don't," and "One Layer of Sand and Gravel, One Layer of Grain," and with the active leadership of heroes, model workers, cadres, Party members, and League members, the laborers finally overcame all difficulties and created digging methods such as "Opening Mountain Embryos," "Snake Shedding Skin," and "凿 Ice in Water", improving the efficiency of the project, increasing the average output per person per day from 0.3 cubic meters to 0.6 cubic meters.

    In order to overcome the difficulty of having few tools, the leadership put forward the slogan of "Tools Don't Rest, People Do" and concentrated the use of pickaxes to attack the central channel. Many laborers worked day and night until the attack was completed. When digging to the bottom of the central channel, there was a lot of seepage. In addition to using pumps to pump water from both ends, the laborers also used the "inverted pond" method to overcome the seepage difficulties. Sometimes the water could not be drained, so the laborers stood in the mud and water, digging the sand and gravel. The mud and water splashed all over their bodies and faces. The sand and gravel had to be groped for one piece at a time from the bottom of the water, like catching fish. Sometimes the ponds were deep, and it was not easy to push the carts up, so the laborers built wooden boards to push them. When it rained and the carts could not be pushed, they took off the cart baskets and carried the soil. Many laborers had their hands, feet, and legs pierced by sand and gravel, but they had no complaints.

    Labor competitions and meritorious service campaigns were launched in the project, fully mobilizing the labor enthusiasm of the workers. In particular, when the Central Film Bureau's photography team went to take film, the slogan "Work Hard to Dig Soil and Strive to Be in the Movie" was unanimously raised among the river workers, which greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for digging soil. A large number of heroes emerged in the campaign. In Xin'an County alone, 412 heroes were selected.

    Through the efforts of more than 48,000 laborers in more than 70 days, they finally overcame the difficulties of sand and gravel and completed the task of digging more than 1.4 million cubic meters in the second phase this spring. By now, the first phase of the ridge-cutting project has been fully completed. A large river, five kilometers long, 180 meters wide, and 2.6 meters deep, has been excavated on this ridge. A central channel, more than 30 meters wide and two meters deep, has been dug in the middle. The excavated gravel and soil have been piled up on the ground 500 meters to 800 meters on both sides of the river, forming two towering and wide dikes. In the summer and autumn of this year, the Yi River, with a flow of 1,000 cubic meters, will flow eastward into the sea. From this autumn to next year, hardworking people will also excavate a large river 400 meters wide and 3 meters to 5 meters deep here, sending all the Yi River, which often floods and causes disasters, into the sea, turning the swampy areas prone to flooding into golden granaries.

　　开山切岭放沂水
    ——导沂工程第一期嶂山切岭记
    高山
    苏北导沂工程中最艰巨的嶂山切岭工程，从去年十一月二十一日开始，至今年五月二十日止，第一期工程已全部完竣。这段工程是在马陵山断麓、嶂山镇以北的岭地上（该岭地高出海平面二十三公尺），从岭西脚夏营庄起，向东至东坡脚，有五公里长。新沂河由西北而来，穿过了骆马湖，必须穿过该岭地，才能至口头入沭河旧道。所以只有切断该岭地，才能彻底完成导沂任务。为此，在去年的夏秋之间，当地中共党委和人民政府就积极领导人民进行切岭准备工作。工程师们在细心勘察、测量，确定河线；民工们则在崎岖的山路上运送粮草。工程在十一月间正式开工，新安县两万七千余民工，冒着严寒风雪，仅二十五天的时间，就完成了第一阶段挖五十二万公方土的任务。
    第二阶段工程是在今年三月开始的，新安、睢宁两县四万八千余民工，在“扒河度灾荒、扒河除水患、扒河为自己”的口号下，走上山岭。这段工程较第一阶段更为艰巨，已由泥土挖到了坚硬的黄土层和稠密的砂礓。含砂礓量一般在百分之六十，最多达百分之七十。在西头工段上，有一层是五公寸厚的整块砂礓，洋镐刨在上面震得非常厉害，有时会把手震破，再加缺乏工具，开始时有人看着砂礓发愁。但在“眼怕手不怕”、“一层砂礓一层粮”的口号下，在英雄模范、干部，党员、团员的积极带头之下，民工们终于战胜了一切困难，而且创造了“开山坯”、“蛇退皮”、“水里凿冰”等刨土办法，提高了工程效率，平均每人每日从零点三公方提高到零点六公方。
    为了克服工具少的困难，领导上提出“歇人不歇工具”的口号，并将洋镐集中使用，突击抢挖中泓。有很多民工日以继夜，直到抢挖完毕。在挖到中泓底时，渗水很多，除用抽水机从两头抽水外，民工们又用倒塘办法，来克服渗水困难。有时水排不出去，民工们就站在泥水中刨着砂礓子，泥水喷得满身满脸，刨起的砂礓子，还要像摸鱼一样，一块一块从水底去摸。有时塘子深了，小车不容易推上来，民工们就搭上木板推。在雨天不能推小车时，他们就把车簸箕拿下来抬土。有很多民工手、脚、腿被砂礓戮破，但他们毫无怨言。
    在工程中开展了劳动竞赛与立功运动，充分地发挥了民工的劳动热忱。特别是当中央电影局摄影队去拍照影片时，河工中一致响起了“努力挖土争取上电影”的口号，更大大地鼓舞了民工挖土情绪。在运动中涌现出大批功臣，仅新安一县即评出功臣四百一十二人。
    经四万八千余民工，在七十多天中的努力，终于战胜了砂礓困难，完成了今春第二阶段一百四十多万公方的任务。至此第一期切岭工程已全部全竣。在这岭地上已开凿成五公里长、一百八十公尺宽，二点六公尺深的一条大河，当中并挖有三十多公尺宽，两公尺深的一道中泓，挖起的礓土，已在大河两岸五百公尺至八百公尺的地面上堆砌成耸高而宽大的两条大堤。在今年的夏秋间，将有一千个流量的沂水，经此滔滔东流入海。在今秋至明年，勤劳的人们，还要在这里开凿成四百公尺宽，三公尺至五公尺深的一条大河。把常会泛滥成灾的沂水，全部送入大海，使洪水泛滥的沼泽地带，变成金色的谷仓。
