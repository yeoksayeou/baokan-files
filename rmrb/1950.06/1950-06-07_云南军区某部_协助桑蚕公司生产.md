Xinhua News Agency, Kunming: A unit of the People's Liberation Army Yunnan Military Region, while undertaking guard duties, actively assists the local state-owned "Yunnan Silkworm Company" in production work such as mulberry picking and silkworm rearing. This company is the largest silkworm seed manufacturing plant in China, with over 5,000 mu of mulberry fields. Before liberation, the company was damaged by remnant bandits, and it faced great difficulties in restoring production after liberation. The company then consulted with the military unit for assistance. A certain unit of the Military Region immediately expressed its acceptance. More than 400 cadres, soldiers, and students from the unit all participated in the work of the silkworm company. They went to the mulberry fields before dawn and worked closely with the employees of the silkworm company, learning from and helping each other. The soldiers also took the initiative to guarantee the company a sufficient supply of mulberry leaves for feeding the silkworms (more than 50,000 kilograms per day). Thanks to the active assistance of the cadres and soldiers and the hard work of the workers, the company's spring silkworm seed production this year reached 123,288 sheets, an increase of more than 30,000 sheets compared to the spring silkworm seed production of 91,917 sheets last year.

　　云南军区某部
    协助桑蚕公司生产
    【新华社昆明电】人民解放军云南军区某部，一面担负警戒任务，一面积极协助驻地国营“云南蚕桑公司”进行采桑、育蚕等生产工作。该公司为中国最大的蚕种制造场，有桑田五千余亩。解放前该公司曾遭残匪破坏，解放后恢复生产很感困难。该公司乃商请部队予以协助。军区某部立即表示接受。该部干部、战士、学员四百余人，全部参加了蚕桑公司工作。他们天不亮就下桑园，在工作中和蚕桑公司的职工们亲密团结，互相学习、帮助。战士们并主动地向公司保证每天充分供给饲蚕的桑叶（每天五万多公斤）。由于干部战士们的积极协助和工人们的努力工作，该公司今年春季蚕种产量达十二万三千二百八十八张，较去年春季蚕种产量九万一千九百一十七张增加了三万多张。
