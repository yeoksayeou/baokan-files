　　A Unit Constructing the Xinjiang Peace Canal Carries Out Cultural Activities During Production to Improve Production Efficiency and Enhance Ethnic Unity

　　[This Dispatch] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army participating in the construction of the massive water conservancy project near Dihua City, Xinjiang Province – the Peace Canal – has greatly promoted the canal construction work by carrying out recreational activities and cultural learning in its work. Each company of a certain regiment's first battalion made horn-shaped tinplate cylinders to shout instructions and broadcast entertainment programs, guiding the work in a timely manner. During breaks, the signalmen busily collected materials to supply the broadcasts. For example, if someone was seen taking off their clothes after sweating, they would broadcast: "Put on your clothes, be careful of catching a cold." When there was time to study, they would broadcast, "Don't forget to study during production," and "Remember to learn three characters every day." After dinner, they broadcast news from outside the company on the roof, including production experiences and the news of the day, as well as kuaiban (a type of rhythmic storytelling), a cappella singing, and so on. Each unit also universally set up blackboards, literacy boards, small wall newspapers, question-and-answer columns, etc., to carry out timely praise and criticism, and exchange production experiences. Some companies put literacy boards next to the canal, and when the soldiers rested, they would study the characters written on the boards, such as "Repair the canal" and "Don't be afraid of difficulties," and practice writing on the ground. Illiterate soldiers in some companies could learn an average of four characters a day. All levels of cadres participating in canal construction, in addition to working with the soldiers and guiding various tasks, also used their rest time every day to read documents and write diaries. Due to the vigor of the cultural work, the labor morale of the unit's soldiers was extremely high. A certain battalion stipulated that work should begin at eight o'clock after breakfast, but some companies would automatically go to work for a while before breakfast. In addition, the unit had a strict organization and plan for the work, so production efficiency doubled. The original work plan scheduled to be completed in twenty days was one-third completed in only three and a half days. Moreover, it educated the soldiers to pay attention to uniting the people of all ethnic groups living along the canal with practical actions. The soldiers dug manure and weeded for the local elders of all ethnic groups, and the elders automatically lent tools to the troops and sent water and food to the canal bank, which was very friendly.

　　修建新疆和平渠某部
    生产中开展文化活动
    提高生产效率增进民族团结
    【本报讯】参加修建新疆省迪化市附近巨大水利工程——和平渠——的人民解放军某部，在工作中开展了文娱活动和文化学习，大大推动了修渠工作。某团一营各连，做成喇叭形的洋铁筒，喊话和播送文娱节目，及时指导工作。休息时，通讯员忙碌地收集材料供给广播。如看到有人出了汗脱衣服，即播：“穿好衣服，注意感冒”。有空学习时，就播“生产莫忘学习”，“记着每天学三个字”。晚饭后，在屋顶上播送连外消息，包括生产经验和当天的新闻，并有快板、清唱等。各单位又普遍设置了黑板报、识字牌、小墙报、问答栏等，及时进行表扬与批评，交流生产经验。有的连队把识字牌插在渠旁，战士们一休息，就学习牌上所写的“修水渠”、“不怕难”等字，并在地上练习写字。某些连队的文盲战士，平均一天能学四个字。参加修渠的各级干部，除和战士们一起劳动，指导各项工作外，每天还利用休息时间看文件、写日记。由于文化工作的活跃，该部战士的劳动情绪极高，某营规定早上八点吃饭后上工，有的连却在早饭前还自动地去工作一阵，加上该部对工作有严密的组织和计划，因此生产效率加倍提高，原定二十天完成的工作计划，仅三天半就完成了三分之一；而且教育了战士们，注意以实际的行动来团结着沿渠居住的各民族群众。战士们为各族老乡挖粪锄草，老乡们自动借工具给部队，向渠岸送水送饭，非常亲切。（《人民军队》报寄稿）
