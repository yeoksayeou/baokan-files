　　Western Sichuan Implements a Mixed Public-Private System for Salt Transportation and Sales
    Uniting Private Merchants to Participate in Salt Transportation in a Planned Manner
    [Chengdu News] According to the Western Sichuan Daily, the Western Sichuan Transportation and Sales Bureau of the Southwest Salt Affairs Administration, in order to unite salt transportation merchants to participate in salt transportation and ensure the supply meets demand so that the market does not suffer from supply-demand imbalance, has decided to terminate the free mining and transportation system from June 1st. A mixed public-private transportation and sales method will be adopted. Merchants are being recruited in Chengdu, Xinjin, Ya'an, Wutongqiao, Meishan and other places to undertake transportation, with quotas assigned by season and month. Under the principle of maintaining the cost of re-transportation, merchants will be given appropriate profits. The deadline for merchant recruitment is the end of June. The change from free mining and transportation to unified public-private transportation and sales is a major transformation in salt transportation and sales. This can overcome the blindness of transportation, sales, and production, determining transportation based on sales, and production based on transportation, so that the market supply and demand are normal, salt field production is planned, and the maintenance and recovery of the entire salt industry can be promoted.
    [Further News] The Western Sichuan Transportation and Sales Bureau of the Southwest Salt Affairs Administration has reduced salt taxes by half from June 1st. The original tax of 116,700 yuan per dan has been reduced to 58,000 yuan per dan from June 1st. Furthermore, in order to adapt to the new situation, the Western Sichuan Transportation and Sales Bureau has also lowered the listed price of edible salt. Ba salt is now 190,000 yuan per dan, and Hua salt is 170,000 yuan per dan; the retail price at consignment stores is 2,100 yuan per jin for Ba salt, and 1,900 yuan per jin for Hua salt.

　　川西食盐公私兼运兼销
    团结私商有计划地参加盐运
    【成都讯】据川西日报消息：西南盐务管理局川西运销局为团结盐运商参加食盐办运，负责供应需要，使市场不致供求失调，决定从六月一日起停止自由采运制度，采取公私兼运兼销办法，特地分别在成都、新津、雅安、五通桥、眉山等地招商承运，分季、分月认额，在维持再运成本的原则下，给运商以适当的利润。招商日期至六月底截止。由自由采运改为公私统一运销，是食盐运销的一次大转变，这可以克服运销及生产的盲目性，以销定运，以运定产，使市场供求正常，盐场生产有计划性，便于促进整个盐业的维持和恢复。
