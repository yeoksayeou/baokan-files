　　Citizens Possessing Explosives and Detonators
    Must Register with the Public Security Bureau
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Military Control Commission has issued a proclamation to the citizens of Beijing, stating that anyone possessing explosives, detonators, detonating cords, etc., must declare and register them with the Beijing Public Security Bureau from June 8th to June 22nd. In the past, some citizens of Beijing, due to the needs of operating coal mines, etc., possessed black powder, nitroglycerin explosives, chlorate explosives, picric acid (commonly known as bitter yellow), T.N.T. explosives or other explosives, detonators, detonating cords, etc. The Beijing Military Control Commission, in order to prevent the aforementioned materials from causing explosions due to improper storage, causing damage to people's lives and property, or falling into the hands of enemy agents and endangering public security, is handling this registration. Regardless of the quantity stored, whether they are usable, whether they are stored by oneself or deposited by others, they must be declared; if they are not reported after the deadline, and are reported by others or discovered, they will be severely punished according to the law.
