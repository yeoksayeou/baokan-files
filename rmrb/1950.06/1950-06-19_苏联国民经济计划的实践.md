　　The Practice of the Soviet National Economic Plan
    Su Liangbin
    This journal has decided to systematically introduce the experiences of Soviet construction from this issue onwards, for the reference of our country's economic workers and other relevant personnel. This article clearly and specifically elucidates the basic tasks of the Soviet national economic plan, its items and indicators, its procedures for compilation and approval, and the inspection of its implementation. It not only allows us to understand the basic characteristics of the Soviet economic system, but also provides important assistance to the work of various departments of our government in formulating and implementing plans.
                                          ——Editor

    The planned nature of the national economy is one of the most significant advantages of the Soviet socialist system, and a crucial indicator of its superiority over the capitalist economic system.

    The socialist plan of the national economy is the most important lever for leading the cause of national social production. The Soviet Constitution states: "The economic life of the USSR is determined and directed by the state national economic plan, with the aim of increasing social wealth, continuously raising the material and cultural level of the working people , consolidating the independence of the USSR and strengthening its defense capabilities."

    The socialist plan is the foundation of the entire economic life of the Soviet socialist system. The economic activities of the state are strictly implemented in accordance with the approved state plan, which has legal force.

    "Our plan is not a predictive plan, nor a speculative plan, but an instructive plan, which must be implemented by the leading organs and determines the direction of our economic development in the future on a national scale." (Stalin)

    In the Soviet Union, the state plan is a huge mobilizing force in the cause of realizing the Bolshevik Party's general line of building a communist society.

    (I) The Tasks of the Soviet Socialist Plan

    There are four basic tasks of a general national nature facing the Soviet socialist plan.

    The first task is to ensure the independence and autonomy of the Soviet national economy and to break free from the encirclement of capitalism.

    The realization of this task is directly linked to guaranteeing the defense capabilities to resist foreign imperialist aggression. This task is solved by creating a strong heavy industry to establish the foundation for the country's economic independence and autonomy. Only on the basis of the heavy industry that has been created can the Soviet Union establish a strong military industry, develop transportation, light industry and the food industry, transform agriculture, and significantly improve the material welfare of the people.

    The second task is to consolidate the historically significant victories of socialism that have been achieved, consolidate the indivisible dominant position of the socialist economic system, block all avenues for the emergence of capitalist elements in the Soviet Union, and ensure the gradual transition of the Soviet state from socialism to communism.

    The construction of socialism in the Soviet Union is based on the adoption of extensive national industrialization to develop and consolidate the socialist forms of economy and to combat capitalist elements. Stalin said: "What we need is not just any kind of industrialization; what we need is such industrialization that can ensure that the socialist forms of industry increasingly surpass the small-commodity forms, especially the capitalist forms. The characteristic of our industrialization is that it is socialist industrialization, capable of ensuring that the socialized part of industry defeats the private economy part, defeats the small-commodity economy and the capitalist part."

    In the decades of Soviet construction, the socialist plan in the hands of the state has been a powerful weapon against capitalist elements.

    The third task is to ensure the continuous growth of production and the fullest development of the productive forces of the Soviet state, based on the widespread adoption of new technological achievements and advanced technical principles, the full utilization of production capacity, and the continuous improvement of labor productivity by instilling average progressive quotas and adopting the working methods of Stakhanov and other advanced producers.

    Moreover, ensuring the appropriate distribution of national production, bringing industry closer to raw material producing areas, power sources and product consumption areas, as well as the widespread industrialization of previously culturally and economically backward ethnic regions and border areas, are essential conditions for the further development of productive forces.

    The fourth task is to prevent phenomena of bias and imbalance in the national economy, to prevent disconnections that may occur in individual departments under individual circumstances, and to establish necessary reserves to quickly correct these disconnections.

    The national economic plan should ensure appropriate proportions in the development of various sectors, and formulate plans to rapidly eliminate existing imbalances in the production development of individual sectors.

    The state plan approved by the government should correctly define the production links between the various interconnected departments of socialist production, combine the growth of production with the growth of consumption, subsidize production and its material guarantees, and appropriately allocate enterprises according to the national region.

    The rate of development between the various sectors of the national economy is determined by the plan in accordance with the tasks facing the country during that period. For example, during the Great Patriotic War, the main task was to crush the enemy, so all the state's funds and resources had to be invested in departments of military significance, and certain restrictions had to be placed on meeting other needs and national economic requirements. In the post-war period, the rate of economic development was based on the completion of the tasks stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan, which stipulated the restoration and development of heavy industry and railway transportation, and on this basis, the large-scale development of agriculture, light industry and the food industry, in order to create an abundance of major consumer goods.

    (II) Items and Indicators of the National Economic Plan

    The state plan of the Soviet Union is the basis of the national economic life. It includes an indicator system of all aspects of socialist reproduction, and stipulates the correct proportions in the growth of production, consumption, accumulation and circulation.

    The production outline, which includes all industrial products, agricultural products and various transportation tasks, is the basis of the national economic plan. The requirements of the production plan determine the tasks regarding basic construction projects and the utilization of new production capacity, the tasks regarding labor, commodity circulation, and other items of the national economic plan.

    The production plan of industrial products has a major significance in the production outline, and it determines the growth of the means of production and the means of consumption.

    The production plan for industrial means of production determines the scope and direction of the technological re-equipment of the national economy, and ensures the supply of raw materials and fuel required by its various departments.

    The industrial production outline is the basis for formulating the retail commodity circulation plan, which in turn influences industry and stimulates its further development.

    The agricultural production plan is closely linked to the industrial outline in terms of guaranteeing the raw materials of light industry, the textile industry, and the food industry. On the other hand, the industrial production plan is closely linked to the agricultural production plan in determining the production of agricultural machinery, tractors, parts, chemical fertilizers and fuel supplied to agriculture.

    The production links in the national economy are realized through transportation.

    The volume of freight transportation of various types is primarily determined by the scale of industrial and agricultural production, because the majority of freight is industrial raw materials or products. Therefore, the transportation plan is formulated based on the industrial production plan, the agricultural production plan, and the distribution of industrial enterprises. The normal work of industry and agriculture depends greatly on good transportation.

    The link between production and consumption is implemented and inspected through the national economic material and technical supply plan, which determines the circulation of means of production, and the commodity circulation plan, which determines the circulation of means of consumption.

    The material and technical supply plan is the distribution of means of production between various departments and economic organizations, and is compiled according to the material balance system. The material balance method plays a decisive role in the compilation of the national economic plan.

    The basic construction outline is one of the most important items of the national economic plan, and it determines the expanded reproduction of basic funds and the development of the national economic production technology base. The basic construction plan is formulated in accordance with the planned degree of production growth and the plan to realize social and cultural facilities.

    The components of the construction plan are investment amount, the utilization of new and rebuilt production capacity, a list of basic construction project names, a housing construction plan, and a design exploration and geological survey work plan.

    The production capacity utilization plan, which determines production growth, is the leading component of the basic construction outline. In order to accelerate the utilization of new and rebuilt production capacity, it is necessary to: concentrate investment and material resources on the construction of the most important departments and key enterprises, widely adopt industrialized working methods in construction, advanced labor organization, and the highest level of mechanization of work that requires a large amount of labor (especially in the case of a lack of surplus labor).

    Directly related to the basic construction plan is also the development plan of the construction industry, which includes the distribution of building and installation projects among various construction agencies, the government's major repair project outline for related construction departments, and the task of construction mechanization.

    The labor plan is also an important item of the national economic plan, and it includes tasks related to labor productivity, the basic number of staff, cadre training, and wages.

    The labor productivity plan in industry and construction is carried out by improving the technical level of individual departments, strengthening the production technology proficiency of workers, improving the material welfare of workers, and achieving advanced enterprises and Stakhanov movement participants in labor productivity.

    Housing, public utilities, health care, and education plans are also closely related to the labor plan. They, along with commodity circulation, can improve the material welfare and cultural life of the Soviet people.

    The technical plan is a special and important department of the national economic plan. It reflects the Soviet state's technical policy aimed at technological progress and rapidly instilling the latest scientific and technological achievements on the production line.

    The technical plan includes the tasks of individual departments of the national economic plan regarding the formulation and instillation of new industrial technical processes (the scope and time limit of the instillation plan), as well as the task of saving metal and materials by using methods of consumption saving and adopting substitutes.

    The cost plan is a component of the national economic plan. It determines the percentage of cost reduction, the amount of savings in individual departments, and the planned cost of the most important products.

    The national economic plan should also include a financial outline (budget, credit, measures to organize currency circulation).

    The national economic plan is not only compiled by sector, but also by region: compiled by various republics, border regions, and states. In this way, it can better utilize the country's productive forces, ensure the elimination of unbalanced distribution of production, and reduce unreasonable and wasteful long-distance transportation in the national economy to a minimum.

    The national economic indicator system is stipulated in accordance with the organizational and sectoral structure of the national economy.

    The indicators of the plan are all the responsibility of specific people. All the tasks in the plan are assigned to the various government ministries, departments, and allied republics to be responsible for completing.

    In the national plan, tasks are stipulated only for the most important products. Then the various government ministries and departments, based on the national plan, formulate their own plans, and stipulate tasks for their subordinate general administrative bureaus and major enterprises according to a wider range of indicators, in order to include a more detailed list of product names. Therefore, as the task reaches the degree of various enterprises, the plan indicators gradually become more detailed and specific.

    The formulation of plan indicators must ensure the proper coordination between its individual components and the necessary proportions between the various departments of the national economy.

    As the degree of national economic growth increases, the system of plan indicators is also expanded and improved. In the initial economic plans of the Soviet state, tasks were stipulated only for a limited scope of indicators and major products, and were mainly expressed in physical quantities. Later, when formulating several Stalin Five-Year Plans, the national economy developed, and the number of plan indicators greatly increased. In addition to the expression of physical quantities, the plan has begun to use value expression, and technical production indicators have been included to reflect technological development and mastery, as well as the qualitative progress that has occurred in the national economy.

    Now, the national economic plan includes all departments of the state-owned economy and the collective farm cooperative economy. The agricultural production plan is formulated according to various collective farms, state-owned farms, and machine-tractor stations.

    All indicators of the national plan are divided into physical and value indicators.

    The physical indicators of the plan are for combining the product manufacturing tasks of various adjacent production departments. In addition, they significantly show the increase in the planned production quantity of products and the degree of development of a certain department of the national economy.

    Value indicators make it possible to determine the more complex economic links and the proportions of the national economy between the development of various departments of the national economy, between the increase in production and consumption, and between consumption and accumulation in the plan; and to calculate the proportions between the development level of industry and agriculture and between industry and transportation.

    The value indicators include total production volume, cost plan, the production value of each worker (in rubles), commodity circulation plan, financial outline and basic construction plan.

    The production indicators expressed in physical quantities include the main types of products in the plan, and their list of names varies according to the current tasks of the national economy. For example, during the Great Patriotic War, great attention was paid to the production plan of special steel. In the post-war period, however, the peaceful industrial products needed to supply the people's livelihood took precedence. Currently, for industrial products alone, about 1,500 types are included in the plan, not including the plan names of various allied republics and ministries, which are supplemented by many types of products according to a wider program. The various competent authorities and enterprises plan their own production programs in detail, and all the products manufactured by the industrial enterprises are included without omission.

    The category of products is also stipulated in the indicators expressed in physical quantities, noting the product's grade, quality, and description.

    The technical and economic quotas that indicate the working quality of the relevant departments of the national economy occupy an important position in the plan's indicator system. The correct stipulation of average progressive quotas in the plan can mobilize the collectives of various enterprises to fight for a higher speed of production and improved use of machinery and equipment.

    Technical and economic quotas are stipulated for the mixing equipment, the amount of machines and machinery used, and the consumption of electricity, fuel, raw materials and materials required per unit of product. They are the most important factors in establishing the plan, especially in establishing the industrial production plan.

    Therefore, the Soviet national economic plan, as a whole, includes the following items:

    1. A general discussion of the basic indicators of national economic development;

    2. Industry - including the total production and commodity production expressed in value, the production volume expressed in physical quantities, technical and economic quotas, and the task of basic repair (overhaul);

    3. Agriculture - sown area, total tractor work, agricultural measures, harvest volume, livestock head count, animal husbandry production, afforestation;

    4. Transportation and Posts and Telecommunications - average daily loading volume, work of various types of transportation, vehicle repair and use, development of telecommunications;

    5. Basic construction - total basic construction, utilization of production capacity and housing area, value of contracted repair projects, development of the construction industry, geological exploration and design work;

    6. Technical plan - a plan for adopting new technologies and advanced industrial technologies in the national economy;

    7. Material balance and national economic supply plan;

    8. Cultural and welfare construction - nursery institutions, health care, schools, universities and cultural and educational institutions, cinemas, radio broadcasting, and public utilities;

    9. Labor - number of workers, labor productivity, wages, cadre training;

    10. Commodity circulation and procurement of agricultural products - domestic trade and foreign trade plans, procurement and acquisition of agricultural products;

    11. State budget, credit, currency circulation;

    12. The economic development of various allied republics and Soviet economic zones.

    The Soviet national economic plan is formulated and approved based on the above basic items and by various government ministries, departments, and allied republics.

    The details of these departments and their content have been accumulated based on the practical experience of the national economic plan for the past thirty years, and the details and indicators of the plan will be changed and supplemented as necessary with the development and complication of the economic life of the socialist country.

    Based on the above indicators of the national economic plan, a system of indicators for the accounting system is established. The Soviet Union's statistics and accounting system serves to complete the plan and is an important tool for leading the socialist economy.

    (III) Procedures for Formulating and Approving the National Economic Plan

    The compilation of the plan is one of the most important tasks in the activities of the Soviet state organs. Both the central and local planning organs and the Soviet organs must actively participate in the compilation of the plan.

    The actual leadership role in compiling the national plan belongs to the Soviet State Planning Committee. Before compiling the plan, the State Planning Committee should formulate various forms and methodological instructions, submit them to the government for approval, and then notify the various government ministries, departments, and allied republics of these forms as guidance for compiling the plan.

    The various government ministries and departments, according to the approved forms and methodological instructions, formulate their own forms and leadership instructions for their subordinate bureaus, and the bureaus further formulate them in detail and send them to various trusts, industrial unions, and enterprises. The allied republics also transmit them to their lower-level relevant organs in the same way. Thus, before compiling the national plan, a great deal of preparatory work is required to formulate the unified forms and methodological instructions required for the plan.

    However, this work is not basically the same every year. The forms and methodological instructions that have been formulated often remain unchanged for many years, and only some local revisions and supplements caused by the life of the national economy itself and management practices are added each year.

    In the Soviet Union, strict discipline must be observed for the forms and instructions for compiling the national plan. Without the approval of the government, no one may adopt new forms and instructions for the plan, and it is even more impermissible to violate the decisions that have already been passed. The various government ministries and departments have no right to change the instructions and details of the forms when they are sent to various places according to their own opinions. They can only make necessary explanations and supplements, but they have no right to delete any indicators in the forms. If it is necessary to modify it, it must be submitted to the government for permission. Usually, the Soviet State Planning Committee must agree in advance. Such strict state discipline is completely necessary when compiling the national economic plan. Otherwise, there may be different results in the understanding of various problems in various places, and completely different formulations may occur when formulating the same plan indicators. In this way, it will be completely impossible to make a unified national economic plan, because it will be formulated using various methods, and therefore it will be impossible to synthesize it.

    The work of compiling the national economic plan is divided into a series of continuous stages. In the practice of planning, the compilation of the national economic plan can be divided into the following working stages:

    1. Formulation of planned control figures and instructions;
    2. Compilation of draft plans according to instructions;
    3. Government approval of the plan;
    4. Organization and supervision of the completion of the plan.

    The instructions for compiling the plan are issued by the Soviet and Party leading organs. For example, the instructions for compiling the First Five-Year Plan were approved by the 15th Party Congress, and the instructions for formulating the Second Five-Year Plan were approved by the 17th Party Conference. The instructions for compiling the annual plan are formulated in advance by the Soviet State Planning Committee as control figures and submitted to the government for approval. These control figures are compiled based on the work experience of all production departments during this planning period, in accordance with the most important indicators of the national economy.

    When formulating the plan instructions for the next planning period and formulating the control figures, it is necessary to calculate all the production possibilities ascertained when studying the development level of productive forces, class interrelationships, and the international environment. Moreover, it is necessary to specifically calculate all the possibilities of the national economy: the development speed achieved in production, the reserve forces for improving labor productivity, the utilization of existing equipment, the adoption of new technologies, the reduction of costs, the accumulation of raw materials, fuel, and material reserves, and the disclosure of the weaknesses and imbalances in the national economy that should be cleared up in the near future.

    It can be seen from this that the instructions for compiling the plan form the general task for the next period, predetermine the development of the leading departments of the national economy, and include instructions on the direction of the entire economic plan and the main strategies related to it to ensure the completion of the plan. The instructions predetermine the entire outline and essence of the plan, establish its main backbone, and then organize the next step of work in compiling the plan based on this backbone.

    The plan instructions are made by the Soviet State Planning Committee in accordance with the instructions of the Party and the government, and in accordance with a certain indicator system, and then, as control figures, are reviewed and approved by the government for further compilation of the national plan.

    The various government ministries, departments, and allied republics, according to the control figures, compile the draft national plan for their various departments, and report this draft to the Soviet Council of Ministers along with the original text related to the compilation of the plan, and send a copy to the Soviet State Planning Committee. Then these materials are carefully reviewed by the State Planning Committee and submitted to the government for final approval in a comprehensive manner.

    When reviewing the drafts of various government ministries and departments, especially when compiling the comprehensive plan of the national economic plan, the Soviet State Planning Committee must carry out profound economic work to coordinate individual production departments and make them mutually coordinated, stipulate the quarterly growth of production and construction, implement the necessary inspections using the balance method for all important planning departments, compile detailed accounting to ensure the supply of fuel, electricity, major materials, and labor for the various important departments of the national economy, determine the proportions between production and consumption, the growth of production and its material guarantees in the national economy, determine the total amount of funding for the entire plan of measures, and make the final national plan for the development of the national economy and submit it to the government for approval.

    At the same time, any changes to the control figures must explain the reasons for the necessary revisions, and submit the statement of reasons to the government together with the national comprehensive plan.

    The government does not immediately approve the plan; first, it must be reviewed by a special committee, which is established to study the drafts compiled in detail and the differences that have occurred between the Soviet State Planning Committee and the various government ministries and departments. The special committee must not only make all the drafts and plan accounting thoroughly consistent, but also coordinate the various parts of the plan and all its revisions and changes, check the proportions in the development speed of various departments, determine the balance of interconnections between departments, and examine and approve the entire plan for national economic funding.

    After reviewing and adjusting the various parts of the plan, the final approval of the entire plan is carried out in the various specialized committees of the government, and then sent to the relevant government ministries and departments for execution and supervision.

    The approved national economic plan must not be changed or supplemented by anyone without the permission of the government; it is a strictly mandatory law for the various government ministries and departments, and all its parts and items must be correctly implemented. If necessary revisions or changes are encountered during the implementation of the plan, they shall be proposed by the Soviet Planning Committee and the relevant ministries and departments of the government, or by the government automatically, and additional tasks for the annual and quarterly plans shall be made by the government's special resolutions or decrees.

    This procedure is based on the practice of socialist construction, and it is completely necessary to ensure the normal development of the national economy, and it is produced by the new tasks of Soviet social development.

    (IV) Inspection of the Implementation of the National Economic Plan

    The state plan of the Soviet Union is a unified system for formulating plans and guaranteeing the organization of plan completion.

    The national economic plan sent to the various government ministries and departments shall be notified to the various enterprises, construction undertakings, and trusts for execution in the shortest possible time (usually three to five days).

    The plan supervision organ shall monitor the plan to reach the executor as quickly as possible, and the tasks notified to the lower-level organizations shall be in accordance with the approved national plan. If there is a delay in communicating the plan in a certain place, it must be reported to the government and the competent department immediately in order to take appropriate measures.

    The next step is the systematic daily supervision of the execution of the plan. Stalin taught us: "The formulation of the plan is only the beginning of the plan. The real plan leadership can only be unfolded after the formulation of the plan, after the inspection on the ground, and in the process of implementation, revision and supplementation of the plan."

    The main task of the inspection of the execution of the plan is to prevent possible biases in the development of individual national economic departments, to discover untapped reserve forces for use in exceeding the completion of the plan. Discovering reserve forces is the most important responsibility of all planning economic organs responsible for inspection.

    In the process of supervising the execution of the plan, check the extent of utilization of equipment, the completion of consumption quotas for raw materials, fuel and materials, and stipulate how to carry out the struggle for saving, reducing costs, and other issues.

    The inspection of production capacity and its utilization is of extreme importance. In the process of inspecting capacity, determine the degree of the enterprise's working rate, the correctness of the plan itself, and the actual reserve forces, which can not only complete the national plan, but also exceed its completion.

    The economic planning organs' constant and profound supervision of the completion of the national plan makes it possible to discover in a timely manner the difficulties that occur in various enterprises and departments of the national economy, and to notify the guiding organs to take supplementary, organizational and other measures to improve the work of all links of social production and to eliminate them.

    Molotov pointed out in his report on the Third Five-Year Plan: "If the plan does not take into account how its execution is progressing, it cannot be considered a good plan. This kind of office plan that is divorced from practical life is worthless. The plan is not equal to compiling a large pile of forms with numbers without executing the plan. Of course, whether our plan is completed has nothing to do with the forms themselves, but this must not be irrelevant to us who lead the planned economy. We need plans in order to have a correct line in economic work. We need plans for various departments, regions, years, and even shorter periods, so that the individual parts and deadlines for completing the plan can be correctly combined and consistent. According to the actual results of the plan's execution, the individual departments, regions, and deadlines for executing the plan must be corrected. We need plans in order to check how our economic work is progressing. If the plan is not linked to the inspection of execution, it will become empty talk on paper. This concerns all our economic organs and all our economic work.

    Only by carrying out strict inspections of the execution of the plan can we improve economic work and the compilation of the plan itself."

　　苏联国民经济计划的实践
    苏良彬
    本刊决定自本期起陆续有系统地介绍苏联建设的经验，以供我国经济工作人员和其他有关工作人员的参考。本文简明而具体地阐明苏联国民经济计划的基本任务，其项目与指标、其编制与批准的程序以及执行的检查，不但使我们认识苏联经济制度的基本特点，而且对我国政府各部门制定和执行计划的工作有重要的帮助。
                                          ——编者
    国民经济的计划性，是苏维埃社会主义制度具有决定意义的优点之一，是超过资本主义经济体系最重要的优越性之一的指标。
    国民经济的社会主义计划，乃是领导全国社会生产事业的最重要的杠杆。苏联宪法上写道：“苏联的经济生活，受国家所定的国民经济计划的决定和指导，以期增进社会财富，不断提高劳动人民的物质和文化水平，巩固苏联的独立性并加强其国防能力”。
    社会主义的计划，是苏维埃社会主义制度的全部经济生活之基础，国家的经济活动，是严格的依照具有法律效力的经过批准的国家计划来实现的。
    “我们的计划，不是预测的计划，也不是臆度的计划，而是指示性的计划，它为领导机关所必须执行，并确定将来全国范围内我们的经济发展的方向。”（斯大林）
    国家计划之在苏联，乃是在实现布尔什维克党建设共产主义社会总路线的事业上巨大的动员力量。
    （一）苏联社会主义计划的任务
    摆在苏联社会主义计划的面前，有四个一般国家性的基本任务。
    第一个任务，是保证苏联国民经济的独立自主性，摆脱资本主义的包围。
    这个任务的实现，是和抵抗外国帝国主义侵犯的国防能力的保证直接联系着。这个任务是用创建强大的重工业，以建立国家经济的独立性和自主性的基础来解决的。只有以创建起来的重工业为基础，苏联才能建立强有力的军事工业，发展运输、轻工业和食品工业，改造农业和显著地提高人民的物质福利。
    第二个任务，是巩固已获得的社会主义的历史上的胜利，巩固社会主义经济制度之不可分的统制地位，闭塞资本主义成份在苏联产生的一切途径，保证苏维埃国家由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义。
    苏联社会主义的建成，是采用广泛的全国工业化，以发展和巩固社会主义的形式经济，打击资本主义成份为基础来进行的。斯大林说：“我们所需要的并非任何一切的工业化，我们需要的是能够保证工业的社会主义形式日益增长地超越小商品形式，尤其是资本主义形式的这样的工业化。我们的工业化的特征，是在于它是社会主义的工业化，能够保证工业的社会化部分战胜私人经济部分、战胜小商品经济和资本主义部分的工业化。”
    在苏维埃建设的诸年代中，掌握在国家手里的社会主义计划，乃是反对资本主义成份的有力武器。
    第三个任务，在于保证生产的不断增长和苏维埃国家生产力的尽量发展，其基础为广泛采用新的技术成就和先进的技术原理，充分利用生产能力，以灌输平均累进定额和采用斯达汉诺夫及其他生产先进者的工作方法的办法，不断提高劳动生产率。
    并且，保证全国生产的适当配布，使工业接近原料产地、电源和产品消费区，以及使从前文化经济落后的民族区和边疆区域之广泛工业化，是生产力进一步发展的必具条件。
    第四个任务，在于防止国民经济中偏重和不均衡的现象，预防在个别的情况下在个别部门可能发生的脱节，以及建立必要的后备力，以便迅速地纠正这些脱节现象。
    国民经济计划中，应该保证各部门发展上的适当的比例，并拟定迅速消除个别部门的生产发展上现有的失调现象。
    在政府批准的国家计划中，应该正确地厘订社会主义生产各衔接部门之间的生产联系，把生产的增长与消费的增长互相结合起来，资助生产和其物质的保证，以及把企业按全国地区予以适当的配备。
    国民经济各部门之间的发展比率，由计划依照国家在该时期所面临的任务来决定的。例如，当伟大的卫国战争时期，主要的任务在于粉碎敌人，因而必须把国家的一切资金和资源都投入于有军事意义的部门，而在其他需要和国民经济要求的满足上不能不受到一定的限制。到了战后时期，经济发展的比率，是以新五年计划所规定的任务之完成为基础来决定的，而新五年计划则规定重工业和铁道运输的恢复与发展，并在这个基础上大量地发展农业、轻工业及食品工业，以期造成主要消费品的丰裕。
    （二）国民经济计划的项目和指标
    苏联的国家计划，是全国经济生活的基础。其中包括社会主义再生产各方面的指标体系，而且规定了生产、消费、积累和流通的增长上的正当比例。
    包括一切工业品，农业品和各种运输任务的生产大纲，是国民经济计划的基础。生产计划的要求，来确定关于基本建设工程和新的生产能力利用的任务，关于劳动、商品流通和国民经济计划其他项目的任务。
    工业制品的生产计划，在生产大纲中有着主要的意义，它决定生产手段和消费手段的增长。
    工业生产手段的生产计划，决定国民经济技术重新装备的范围及方向，以及保证其各种部门所需原料及燃料的供给。
    工业生产大纲，是制定零售商品流通计划的基础，而这种计划又给工业以影响，刺激它的进一步发展。
    农业生产计划，在保证轻工业、纺织工业及食品工业各部门的原料方面是与工业大纲密切联系的。另一方面，工业生产计划，在决定供给农业的农业机器，拖拉机，零件，化学肥料和燃料的生产方面，则与农业生产计划密切联系。
    国民经济中的生产联系，是靠着交通运输来实现的。
    各种运输的运货量，首先是依工业生产和农业生产的规模而定的，因为货运的大部分都是工业原料或制品。所以，运输计划，是根据工业生产计划、农业生产计划及工业企业的配布来制定的。而工业及农业的正常工作，又有赖于良好的运输工作之处极多。
    生产与消费之间的联系，是通过确定生产手段流通的国民经济物质技术供应计划和确定消费手段流通的商品流通计划来实行和检查的。
    物质技术供应计划，是各部门和各经济组织之间生产手段的分配，根据物质平衡制度而编制的。物质平衡法，在国民经济计划的编制上起着决定的作用。
    基本建设大纲是国民经济计划的最重要项目之一，它确定基本资金的扩大再生产和国民经济生产技术基础的发展。基本建设计划，是依照生产的预定增长程度和实现社会文化设施的计划来制定的。
    建设计划的组成部分是投资额，新的和改建的生产能力的利用，基本建设工程名称表，住宅建设计划，设计探勘和地质调查工作计划。
    决定以生产增长的生产能力利用计划，是基本建设大纲的领导成份。为了加速利用新的和改建的生产能力起见，就需要：集中投资和物质资源于最重要的部门及首要事业的建设，在建设中广泛采用工业化的工作方法，先进的劳动组织，需要大量劳动力的工作机械化的最高水平（特别在缺乏剩余劳动力的情况之下）。
    与基本建设计划直接联系的还有建筑工业发展计划，它包括建筑按装工程在各建筑机关之间的分配，政府有关建设各部包修工程大纲和建筑机械化的任务。
    劳动计划也是国民经济计划的一个重要项目，它包括有关劳动生产率，工作人员的基本数目，干部培养和工资的任务。
    工业中和建设中的劳动生产率计划，是以提高个别部门的技术水平，强化工人的生产技术熟练程度，改善工人的物质福利事业，以及在劳动生产率上达成先进的企业和斯达汉诺夫运动者为出发点而进行的。
    住宅、公用事业、保健和教育计划，也与劳动计划有密切的联系，它们与商品流通并列，可以提高苏维埃人民的物质福利和文化生活。
    技术计划是国民经济计划的特殊而重要的部门，它反映苏维埃国家以技术的进步和在生产线上迅速灌输最新的科学与技术成就为目的的技术政策。
    技术计划包括国民经济计划个别部门关于制定及灌输新的工业技术过程的任务（灌输方案的范围及期限），以及利用消费节约及采用代用品的办法以节约金属与器材的任务。
    成本计划为国民经济计划的组成部分，它确定减低成本的百分率，个别部门的节约金额以及最重要的制品的计划成本。
    国民经济计划也要包括财政大纲（预算、信贷、组织货币流通的措施）。
    国民经济计划不仅按部门编制，而且按区域：按各共和国、边区和州编制，如此才能更好地利用国家生产力，保证生产不平衡配布之消除，把国民经济中不合理的无益的长距离运输缩减到最低限度。
    国民经济指标体系，是依照国民经济的组织的和部门的结构来规定的。
    计划的指标，都是有专人负责的。计划中的一切任务都是分配给政府各部、署和各盟员共和国来负责完成。
    在全国计划中，仅就最主要的生产品规定任务。然后政府各部、署，再根据全国计划，制定自己的计划，给自己所属各管理总局和主要企业按更广泛的指标范围规定任务，以便包括更详尽的制品名称表。因此，随着任务到达各企业的程度，计划指标也就逐渐更详尽而更具体化。
    计划指标的制订，须保证它个别成份之间的正当配合和国民经济各部门之间的必要比例。
    伴随国民经济增长的程度，计划指标的体系也被扩大和改善了。在苏维埃国家最初的经济计划里，仅就指标的有限的范围和主要的生产品规定任务，而且主要是以物量表示。后来在制定几次斯大林五年计划时，国民经济发展了，计划的指标数目也就大大地增加了。除了物量的表示以外，计划已开始用价值表示了，而且列入技术生产的指标，以便表现技术的发展和掌握，以及国民经济中所发生的质量的进步。
    现在，国民经济计划包括了国营经济和集体农庄合作社经济的一切部门。农业生产计划是按各集体农场，国营农场和机器——拖拉机站来制定的。
    全国计划的所有指标，都分为物量的和价值的。
    计划的实物指标，是为了结合各邻接生产部门的产品制造的任务，此外，并且显著地表明出所计划的制品生产数量的增长和国民经济某一部门的发展程度。
    价值指标，使得以在计划中确定国民经济各个部门发展之间，增长生产与消费之间，消费与积累之间的较复杂的经济联系和国民经济的比例；并且借以计算工业与农业发展水平之间和工业与运输之间等等的比例。
    属于价值指标的有总生产量、成本计划、每一名工人的生产价值（若干卢布），商品流通计划，财政大纲和基本建设计划。
    以物量表示的生产指标，包括计划中主要种类的制品，并且它们的名称表要视国民经济的当前任务如何而有变化。例如，在卫国战争时期，对特种钢的生产计划予以很大注意，到了战后时期，则供应人民生活必需的和平工业制品就占优势了。现在，仅就工业制品而言，列入计划的约在一千五百种左右，各盟员共和国和各部的计划品名尚未计算在内，而这些计划品名按照更广泛的纲领又补充提出了许多的产品种类。各主管机关和各企业又详尽地计划自己的生产纲领，而工业企业所制造的一切制品都无遗漏地全数列入。
    产品的品类，也规定在物量表示的指标中，注明产品的等级，质量和说明。
    表明国民经济有关部门的工作质量的技术经济定额，在计划的指标体系中占有重要的地位。正确的平均累进定额在计划中的规定，可以动员各企业的集体来为了生产之更高速度及改良机器设备使用而斗争。
    技术经济定额，是为了混合装备，机器和机械的使用量，以及每一产品单位所需的电力，燃料，原料及材料消费量而规定的。它们是建立计划，尤其是建立工业生产计划之最重要的因素。
    因此，苏联国民经济计划，在其总体上就包含下列项目：
    一、总论国民经济发展的基本指标；
    二、工业——包括以价值表示的生产总额与商品生产，以物量表示的生产量，技术经济定额，基本修理（大修）的任务；
    三、农业——播种面积，拖拉机的工作总量，农业措施，收获量，牲畜头数，畜牧业的生产，造林；
    四、运输及邮电——平均一昼夜的装载量，各种运输的工作，车辆修理及使用，电信的发展；
    五、基本建设——基本建设总量，生产能力和住宅面积的利用，包修工程的价值，建筑工业的发展，地质探勘及设计工作；
    六、技术计划——国民经济中采用新的技术及先进的工业技术的计划；
    七、物质平衡及国民经济供应计划；
    八、文化福利建设——保育机关，保健，学校，高等学校和文化教育机关，电影院，无线电广播和公用事业；
    九、劳动——工人数目，劳动生产率，工资，干部培养；
    十、商品流通和农业产品的采购——国内贸易及国外贸易计划，农业品的采办和收购；
    十一、国家预算，信贷，货币流通；
    十二、各盟员共和国和苏联各经济区经济的发展。
    苏联国民经济计划是依据上列的基本项目并按政府各部、署和各盟员共和国来制定和批准的。
    这些部门的细目及其内容，乃是根据国民经济计划三十年来的实际经验积累而成，并且随着社会主义国家经济生活的发展和复杂化的程度，对于计划细目和指标都会加以必要的变更和补充。
    根据国民经济计划的上述指标，建立起核算制度的指标体系。苏联的统计与核算制度，就是为了完成计划而服务的，也是领导社会主义经济的重要工具。
    （三）制定与批准国民经济计划的程序
    计划之编制是苏联国家机关活动中的一个最重要的任务。不论中央或地方的计划机关与苏维埃机关都要积极地参与计划的编制。
    编制国家计划的实际领导作用是属于苏联国家计划委员会。国家计划委员会在编制计划之前，应定出各种表格与方法上的指示，呈请政府批准，然后再把这些表格通知政府各部、署和盟员共和国，作为编制计划时的指导。
    政府各部、署根据所批准的表格与方法指示，对于所属的各局定出自己的表格与领导性指示，各局再详加制定，送达各托拉斯、工业联合与企业。盟员共和国同样也传达于自己的下级有关机关。这样，在编制国家计划之先，需要很大的一项准备工作，制定出计划所需的统一的表格和方法上的指示。
    但是这项工作，并非每年基本上都要如此。已经制定的表格与方法上的指示，往往多年不变，每年仅加上一些由于国民经济的生活本身与管理实践所引起的局部的修正与补充。
    在苏联，对于编制国家计划的表格与指示，要遵守严格的纪律。没有政府的批准，任何人不得对计划采用新的表格与指示，更不允许违反业已通过的决定。政府各部、署在向各地发出表格的指示与细则时，无权依照自己的意见加以改变。他们只能加以必要的解释与补充，但没有删除表格中的任何指标之权。如遇有修改的必要时，须呈请政府许可，通常只要苏联国家计划委员会预先同意即可。这样严格的国家纪律，在编制国民经济计划时是完全必要的，否则，各地对于各个问题的理解，可能有不同的结果，并且在制定同一的计划指标时，发生完全不同的提法。这样就完全不可能做出统一的国民经济计划了，因为它将是用各种方法制定的，从而就是无法综合起来了。
    编制国民经济计划的工作，分为一系列的连续的阶段。在计划的实践中，编制国民经济计划可分为下列的工作阶段：
    １、制定计划的控制数字和指令；
    ２、根据指令编制计划草案；
    ３、政府批准计划；
    ４、组织与监督计划的完成。
    编制计划的指令由苏维埃的与党的领导机关发出。例如，编制第一次五年计划的指示，是由第十五次党的代表大会批准的，而制定第二次五年计划的指示，则由第十七次党的代表会议批准。编制年度计划的指令由苏联国家计划委员会预先制定，作为控制数字，提请政府批准，此项控制数字，是根据一切生产部门在本计划时期内的工作经验，按照国民经济的最主要的指标编制的。
    在拟定下一计划时期的计划指示与制定控制数字时，要计算到在研究生产力发展水平，阶级相互关系，国际环境时所判明的一切生产的可能性。而且要具体地计算到国民经济的一切可能性：生产上所达到的发展速度，提高劳动生产率的后备力，现有设备的利用，新技术的采用，成本的减低，原料、燃料与材料贮备的积蓄，以及揭露国民经济中最近时期应行肃清的弱点与不均衡现象。
    由此可见，编制计划的指示，就形成了下一时期的总的任务，预定了国民经济主导部门的发展，包括关于全部经济计划方向和与它有关的保证完成计划的主要方策之指示。指示预定了计划的整个轮廓与要旨，建立它的主要骨干，然后根据这种骨干再组织编制计划的下一步工作。
    计划的指示，是由苏联国家计划委员会遵照党与政府的指示，并依照一定的指标体系制成的，然后作为控制数字，经政府审查批准，以便进一步编制国家计划。
    政府各部、署与盟员共和国，根据控制数字，编制其各部门的国家计划草案，并将此项草案连同有关编制计划的原文呈报苏联部长会议，另以副本送交苏联国家计划委员会，然后这些材料由国家计划委员会详细审查，以综合的方式呈请政府最后批准。
    苏联国家计划委员会在审查政府各部、署的草案时，特别是在编制国民经济计划的综合计划时，要进行配合个别生产部门而使之互相协调的深刻的经济工作，规定生产与建设的逐季增长额，对一切重要的计划部门用平衡方法，实行必要的检查，编制精细的核算，以保证国民经济各重要部门的燃料，电力，主要材料与劳动力的供给，确定国民经济中生产与消费之间，生产的增长与其物质保证之间的比例，确定全部措施方案的资助总额，作出最后的发展国民经济的国家计划，提请政府批准。
    同时，凡是对于控制数字的变更，均须说明其必要修正的原因，并将理由书连同国家综合计划呈报政府。
    政府并不立即批准计划；首先要在专门委员会加以审查，这种专门委员会是为了详细研究所编制的草案及苏联国家计划委员会与政府各部、署之间所发生的不同意见而设立的。专门委员会不仅要使所有的草案与计划核算达到彻底一致，同时还要使计划的各个部分和对它的一切修正与变更互相协调起来，检查各个部门在发展速度上的比例，确定各部门之间的平衡上的相互联系，并审定国民经济资助的整个计划。
    经过审查与调整计划的各个部分之后，在政府各专门委员会中进行全部计划的最后批准，然后分送政府有关的各部、署，以便执行与监督。
    业经批准的国家国民经济计划，非经政府的许可，任何人不得加以变更或补充；它对于政府各部、署乃是严格的强制性的法律，它的所有各个部分与项目都要正确予以执行。如果在执行计划期中，遇有必要的修正或变更时，则由苏联计划委员会和政府有关的部与署建议，或由政府自动提出，用政府的专门决议或法令，作成年度与季度计划的追加任务。
    这种程序是根据社会主义建设的实践而建立的，它对于保证国民经济的正常发展是完全必要的，它是由新的苏维埃社会发展任务所产生的。
    （四）执行国民经济计划的检查
    苏联的国家计划，是制定计划与组织计划完成的保证的统一制度。
    送达政府各部与各署的国民经济计划，在最短时间内（通常是三日至五日），即通知各企业，各建设事业和各托拉斯去执行。
    计划的监督机关，监视计划尽可能地迅速到达执行者，通知下层组织的任务，应确实符合于批准的国家计划。如果某一地方在传达计划上发生了迟延，必须立即呈报政府与主管部，以便采取适当办法。
    进一步是对于执行计划的有系统的日常的监督。斯大林教导我们说：“计划的制定仅仅是计划的开始，真正的计划领导只有在制定计划之后，在地方上检查之后，在计划的实现、修正与补充的过程中才能展开。”
    执行计划的检查，其主要任务在于预防个别国民经济部门发展中可能发生的偏重，发现尚未利用的后备力量，以便用于超过完成计划。发现后备力量乃是所有负检查责任的计划经济机关的最重要的职责。
    在监督执行计划的进程之中，检查利用设备的程度，原料，燃料及材料的消费定额的完成，规定如何进行节约，减低成本与其他问题的斗争。
    生产能力及其利用情形的检查，具有极重要的意义。在检查能力的过程中，确定企业的工作率的程度，计划本身编制的正确性和实有的后备力量，这种后备力量不仅可以完成国家计划，而且也可以超过完成它。
    经济计划机关，对完成国家计划的经常的深刻监督，使得以及时发现各个企业和国民经济部门中所发生的困难，并通知指导机关，以便采取补充的，组织性的与其他改善社会生产一切环节工作的办法来消除。
    莫洛托夫在其第三次五年计划的报告中曾经指出：“如果计划不计算到它的执行进程如何，决不能认为是好计划。这种办公室的脱离实际生活的计划是一文不值的。计划不等于脱离执行计划的进程而去编制带有数字的大堆表格。当然，我们的计划是否完成，是与表格本身无关，但是这对于我们领导计划经济的人们却决不能无关的。我们需要计划，是为了在经济工作中有一个正确的路线。我们需要各部门的、各地区的、各年度的，以至更短期间的计划，要使完成计划的个别部分与期限能够正确地结合一致。按照计划的实际执行结果，必须对执行计划的个别部门，地区与期限加以纠正。我们需要计划，是为了检查我们的经济工作进行得如何。如果计划不和执行的检查联系，那就会变成纸上空谈。这是关系我们所有的经济机关和所有的经济工作的。
    我们对于计划的执行加以严格的检查，才能改善经济工作和计划本身的编制”。
