　　Literature of Free China
    Ni Feiding
    The historic victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army brought about the complete collapse of the ancient feudal culture with its aging traditions and Confucian doctrines, a culture that served the interests of the ruling groups of the bourgeoisie and landlords – the Kuomintang.

    In 1942, at the height of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mao Zedong, the leader of New Democratic China, encouraged literary and art workers at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art to build a militant patriotic literature. He said: "...to make literature and art a component part of the entire revolutionary machine; as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, strike at the enemy, and eliminate the enemy, to help the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind."

    China's best writers responded enthusiastically to this call. With their sharp weapons – their works – they helped the people defeat the Japanese aggressors, and now, together with the whole people, they are waging a selfless struggle against the Kuomintang counter-revolutionaries under the aegis of American imperialism for China's national independence and freedom.

  After declaring war on the old world of the bourgeoisie and landlords, today's progressive Chinese literature focuses on the rectification of art and the construction of New China. Those old, stubborn aesthetic regulations have been discarded, and the people are creating their own literature – purposeful and ideologically elevated literature, inextricably linked to China's social and political life.

    The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference states: "The culture and education of the People's Republic of China shall be New Democratic, i.e., national, scientific, and popular."

    I have here several issues of two literary magazines recently published in Beijing, the capital of People's China: *People's Literature*, the organ of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and *Literary Gazette*, the organ of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Both of these publications vividly demonstrate the great changes taking place in modern Chinese life. In these publications, we see many articles by Chinese celebrities and politicians on the fundamental issues of the development of modern Chinese art and literature.

    Particularly interesting in this regard is the "Inaugural Message" published in *People's Literature* by Mao Dun, Minister of Culture and one of China's leading writers. When speaking about the main tasks facing Chinese writers and artists today, Mao Dun said that art and literature must reflect the solemn greatness of the epoch-making events that are taking place in China. The writer must depict the birth and growth of New China, he must express and praise the achievements of the people in revolutionary struggle and economic construction, and he must create works that can satisfy the aesthetic requirements of the broad masses and educate them with the spirit of serving the motherland wholeheartedly.

    *People's Literature* implements the principles put forward by Mao Dun, analyzes the works of many writers, and asks them to bravely step into the torrent of life. This magazine calls for more poetry, short stories, plays, newsletters, and essays that faithfully depict the daily life and efforts of the liberated people in the army, in the countryside, in the cities, and in the factories.

    Last July, the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers was held in liberated Beijing. This meeting, made possible by the victory of the People's Liberation Army over the Kuomintang reactionaries, was the first free gathering of China's true free and democratic fighters. *People's Literature* published Zhou Yang's, the famous political commentator and literary critic, report on the new literature and art of the Chinese people at the Congress.

    He said: "...Since the 'Forum on Literature and Art,' the face of literature and art and the face of literary and art workers in the liberated areas have undergone fundamental changes. This is truly new people's literature and art. The relationship between literature and art and the broad masses has also fundamentally changed. Literature and art has become one of the effective tools for educating the masses and educating cadres, and literary and artistic work has become a work that is very responsible to the people."

    Speaking of new themes, new characters, and new literary methods, Zhou Yang emphasized that new life has powerfully poured into the realm of art. The recently published *People's Literature and Art Series*, which includes one hundred and seventy-seven novels, short stories, plays, poems, and reports, vividly demonstrates how Chinese literature has changed direction and how it has inextricably linked with reality. More than one hundred works describe the War of Resistance Against Japan for national liberation, the Chinese people's liberation struggle, and the life of the People's Army. The themes of more than forty other works are the struggle of peasants against feudal forces in the countryside and their demand for land. Many works in this series describe the restoration of industrial production and the organizational work of the Communist Party. A few works describe the historical themes of the heroic traditions of the Chinese people's liberation struggle.

    The most fundamental theme of all the works in this series is the theme of the heroic Chinese people's national liberation and class struggle and their labor feats. In these works, workers, peasants, and soldiers, who resolutely grasp the destiny of the country in their own hands, are portrayed as the true masters.

    The prophetic words spoken by the great Chinese writer Lu Xun in 1934 in the postscript to *Collection of Introductions* have been realized.

    "The future light will surely prove that we are not only preservers of literary and artistic heritage, but also pioneers and builders."

    In recent years, progressive Chinese writers have created many outstanding patriotic works. Among the famous ones are: *Changes in Li Family Village* by the progressive writer Zhao Shuli, which describes the liberation of a Chinese village and the implementation of land reform, as well as the same author's *The Ballads of Li Youcai*; *The New Story of Heroes and Heroines* by Kong Jue and Yuan Jing; *Landmine Warfare* by Shao Zinan; Hu Danfei's play *Look a Little Further*; *Blood and Tears of Hatred* and *The Poor Man's Hatred* by Ma Jianling; *Invincible Militia* by Ke Zhongping; the opera *Liu Hulan*; the film *The Bridge*, etc.

    The heroic struggle of the Chinese people against national oppression and feudal forces is faithfully and convincingly expressed in these works. We can see how they overcame all obstacles, and how heroes of war and labor emerged from them.

    China's progressive literature has been inspired and motivated by the noble ideas that have been imported into China from the great Soviet Union. Mao Dun, in an article published in *Literary Gazette* entitled "Welcome Our Big Brother, Learn From Our Big Brother," spoke of the beneficial influence of Soviet literature on Chinese literature.

    Zhou Libo, in an article published in *People's Literature* entitled "We Cherish Soviet Literature," said: "Soviet poetry and novels have long been widely read in China. Gorky, Mayakovsky, Fadeyev, Sholokhov and Simonov are all very familiar names in China..."

    Zhou Libo wrote: "In the past, in the environment of guerrilla warfare, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army often had to cross enemy blockades lightly due to frequent wars and the 'mopping-up' operations of the Japanese invaders. Some comrades even discarded their clothes and letters from their relatives, but they still carried Soviet novels. Soviet novels were regarded as important as their weapons."

    Yao Yuanfang, in an article published in *Literary Gazette* entitled "Soviet Wartime Literature Has Become Our Invisible Military Force," reported how Soviet writers became true comrades-in-arms of the heroic soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

    Yao Yuanfang wrote: "Korneichuk's *The Front*, Simonov's *Days and Nights*, Grossman's *The People Are Immortal*, Pigalev's biography of the outstanding Russian military strategist Suvorov – *Soldier and Commander*, as well as the films *Thirteen Heroes*, *The Kronstadt Naval Uprising*, etc., especially Beck's *The Volokolamsk Highway*, which describes the touching and heroic history of the arduous creation of the Panfilov Division, ...are read tirelessly by the vast commanders of our troops. Almost without exception, from senior generals to junior commanders read it, some even studied it four or five times..." In meetings, during military training, and in meetings to study battles, commanders always cited examples from these books.

    "In the editorial department of our war zone newspaper, we often receive reading experiences and thoughts written by the commanders of the troops on *The Volokolamsk Highway*, and conduct self-criticism by connecting their thoughts in the articles...."

    During the siege of Shijiazhuang, the author continued to write, many units of General Nie Rongzhen's troops specially studied the chapter in *Days and Nights* that describes the battle for every room in Stalingrad commanded by Shavlov. General Xu Xiangqian's troops, in the campaign to capture Taiyuan, similarly printed an excerpt of this chapter into battlefield leaflets and distributed them to the troops in charge of street fighting. These leaflets proved to be of invaluable help in capturing one of the most fortified fortresses in North China.

    The works of Soviet writers have thus become a powerful force and an ideological weapon in the struggle against the corrupt Kuomintang reactionary forces encouraged by American imperialism. They illuminated the road of the victorious Chinese People's Liberation Army and served its heroic fighters.

    Chinese literature, which is closely integrated with the life of the country, is gaining an increasingly wide readership. It is a faithful expression of the thoughts of a great nation that is building a new democratic culture.

### 自由中国的文学

　　自由中国的文学
    尼·费德林
    中国人民解放军的历史性的胜利带来了古老的封建文化及其衰老的传统和孔子教义的完全崩溃，这种文化是服务于资产阶级和地主的统治集团——国民党的利益的。
    在一九四二年，正当抗战的高潮时，新民主主义中国的领袖毛泽东在延安文艺座谈会上鼓励文艺工作者们建设一种战斗的爱国主义的文学。他说：“……要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分；作为团结人民，教育人民，打击敌人，消灭敌人的有力武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”
    中国最优秀的作家们热烈地响应了这个号召。以他们的锐利的武器——作品去帮助人民战胜了日本的侵略，现在，又和全人民在一起反对美帝国主义卵翼下的国民党反革命，为中国的民族独立和自由作舍身的斗争。
  在对资产阶级和地主们的旧世界宣战之后，今天的中国进步文学，专注于艺术的整顿和新中国的建设。那些古老的、顽固的美学法规已被抛弃，人民正在创造他们自己的文学——有目的的和富有高尚思想的文学，和中国的社会生活与政治生活不可分地结合着的文学。
    中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领中说：“中华人民共和国的文化教育为新民主主义的，即民族的、科学的、大众的文化教育。”
    我手边有几期在人民中国的首都北京最近出版的两种文学杂志：全国文协的机关刊《人民文学》，和全国文联的机关刊《文艺报》，这两种刊物都生动的证明了在现代中国的生活里所发生着的伟大变化。在这些刊物里，我们看到中国的名流和政治家的关于现代中国艺术和文学的发展的基本问题的许多文章。
    在这方面特别使人感到兴趣的是《人民文学》上所发表的，文化部部长和中国的领袖作家之一，茅盾写的《发刊词》。说到今天中国作家和艺术家面临的主要任务的时候，茅盾说艺术和文学必须反映那些正在中国发生的划时代事件的庄严伟大。作家必须描写新中国的诞生和生长，他必须表现和歌颂人民在革命斗争中和经济建设中的成就，他必须创造能满足广大群众的欣赏要求、并且用全心全意服务祖国的精神去教育他们的作品。
    《人民文学》实行着茅盾所提出的原则，分析了许多作家的作品，要求他们勇敢地走进生活的激流。这杂志要求有更多的诗歌、短篇小说、剧本、通讯报告和论文，对在军队里、在乡村里、在城市里、在工厂里的解放了的人民的日常生活和努力作忠实的描写。
    去年七月，在解放了的北京，召开了全国文学艺术工作者代表大会，这个会议由于人民解放军对国民党反动派的胜利而可能，是中国的真正的自由民主战士们的第一次自由的集会。《人民文学》上发表了著名的政论家和文学批评家周扬在文代会上所作的关于中国人民的新文艺的报告。
    他说：“……‘文艺座谈会’以后，在解放区，文艺的面貌、文艺工作者的面貌，有了根本的改变。这是真正新的人民的文艺。文艺与广大群众的关系也根本改变了。文艺已成为教育群众、教育干部的有效工具之一，文艺工作已成为一个对人民十分负责的工作。”
    说到新的主题、新的人物、新的文学方法，周扬强调说，新生活强有力地涌进了艺术的境界之中。新近出版的包括了一百七十七篇小说、短篇小说、剧本、诗歌、报告的《人民文艺丛书》，鲜明地证明了中国文学如何改变了方向和如何与现实结了不可解脱的联系。有一百篇以上的作品是描写民族解放的抗日战争，中国人民的解放斗争和人民军队的生活的。其他四十篇以上的作品的主题是农民反对农村里的封建势力和要求土地的斗争。这丛书里有许多作品描写恢复工业生产和共产党的组织工作。少数作品是描写中国人民解放斗争的英勇传统的历史题材。
    这个丛书的所有作品的最根本的主题，是英勇的中国人民的民族解放和阶级斗争和劳动伟绩的主题。在这些作品中，那些坚决地把国家的命运掌握在自己手中的工人、农民和士兵们，被表现为真正的主人。
    伟大的中国作家鲁迅于一九三四在《引玉集》的后记中所说的预言式的话，已经实现了。
    “将来的光明，必将证明我们不但是文艺上的遗产的保存者，而且是开拓者和建设者。”
    中国进步作家近年来创作了许多出色的爱国作品。其中著名的是：进步作家赵树理的《李家庄的变迁》，描写一个中国乡村的解放和土地改革的施行，以及同一作者的《李有才板话》；孔厥和袁静的《新儿女英雄传》；邵子南的《地雷阵》；胡丹沸的剧本《把眼光放远一点》；马健翎的《血泪仇》和《穷人恨》；柯仲平的《无敌民兵》；歌剧《刘胡兰》；电影《桥》等等。
    中国人民反对民族压迫和封建势力的英勇斗争，在这些作品里是被忠实地和使人信服地表现了。我们可以看到他们如何克服了一切障碍，以及战争与劳动的英雄们如何从他们中出现。
    中国的进步文学曾受到从伟大的苏联传入中国的崇高思想的启发和激励。茅盾在《文艺报》发表的一篇《欢迎我们的老大哥，向我们的老大哥看齐》，说到了苏联文学对中国文学的有益的影响。
    周立波发表于《人民文学》上的，题名《我们珍爱苏联的文学》一文中说：“苏联的诗歌和小说，很久以来就在中国得到了广大的读者。高尔基，马雅可夫斯基，法捷耶夫，萧洛霍夫和西蒙诺夫等等在中国都是十分熟悉的名字……”
    周立波写道：“解放军的指战员们在过去，在游击战争的环境里，由于战争的频繁，日寇的“扫荡”，常常要过敌人的封锁线，常常要轻装，有些同志，把自己的衣服和亲人的书信都丢了，但还是携带着苏联的小说。苏联的小说被看得和自己的武器一样的重要。”
    姚远方在《文艺报》上发表的《苏维埃战时文学成了我们无形的军事力量》一文，报告了苏联作家们怎样成了英勇的人民解放军的战士们的真正的战友。
    姚远方写道：“高涅楚克的《前线》，西蒙诺夫的《日日夜夜》，格罗斯曼的《人民是不朽的》，皮加别夫著的俄罗斯杰出军事家苏沃洛夫的传记——《士兵兼统帅》，以及电影《十三勇士》《克隆斯达海军起义》等等，特别是别克著的描述潘菲洛夫师团艰苦缔造的可歌可泣的历史——《恐惧与无畏》，……更使我们部队广大指挥员百读不厌，从高级将领直至下级指挥员几乎是毫无例外地读它，有的甚至精读了四五遍……”在会议上，军事训练中，在研究战役的会议中，指挥员们总是引证这些书里的例子。
    “在我们战地报纸的编辑部，时常可以收到部队指挥员们写来的读《恐惧与无畏》的心得和感想，并在文章中联系他们的思想进行自我批评……。”
    在石家庄的攻坚战中，作者继续写道，聂荣臻将军所部的许多部队，专门研究了《日日夜夜》中描写沙伏洛夫指挥斯大林格勒的一个逐房争夺战斗的一章。徐向前将军所部在攻取太原的战役中，同样地将这一章的摘要印成战场传单，发给担任巷战的部队。这些传单证明了对于攻占华北最强固的堡垒之一，有无可估价的帮助。
    苏维埃作家的作品，就是这样的成了反对美帝国主义所鼓励的腐败国民党反动势力的斗争中的一种强大的力量，一种思想的武器。他们照明了胜利的中国人民解放军的道路，并且为它的英勇的战斗员们服了务。
    和国家的生活密切结合起来的中国文学，正在获得日益增加的广大读者。它是一个在建设着新民主主义文化的伟大民族的思想的忠实表现。
