    The CPC Lan County Committee and Wu Township First District Committee
    Lead the Masses to Overcome Freeze Disasters
    Burning Fires to Prevent Frost Achieves Great Results in Qinyuan Chengguan and Other Nine Villages
    [Taiyuan News] Shanxi Daily News: In May, the CPC Lan County Committee and the CPC Wu Township First District Committee led the masses in more than sixty villages to "burn fires to prevent freezing," overcoming natural disasters. The CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee has made a decision to commend them. On May 21st, the climate in Lan County suddenly changed. The CPC County Committee anticipated that a freeze disaster might occur the next morning. In order to prevent the crops from being frozen, it immediately held an emergency meeting to study countermeasures. It immediately mobilized and transferred more than 50 party member cadres from county-level agencies and the second and third districts, rushing to 54 natural villages between the first and third districts overnight to mobilize the masses to carry out fire prevention against freezing. At cockcrow the next day, fires were lit everywhere, with smoke and flames rising all over the mountains and fields, and the climate gradually warmed, ensuring that the crops in the 54 villages were intact. According to the lessons learned from the freezing of crops in the district last spring, the First District Committee of the CPC Wu Township Committee put forward the slogan "Man will conquer nature, protect seedlings as if protecting life" after spring plowing and sowing, calling on everyone to prevent freeze disasters. Each village established a freeze and frost prevention committee and set up 300 freeze and frost prevention stations. Then, it focused on mobilizing the 18 villages that were prone to freezing, stockpiling more than 100,000 catties of firewood to prevent any climate changes, lighting them on the spot. On May 5th, a strong wind suddenly arose, and the climate suddenly changed. The district committee immediately suggested that the district government and 13 villages, including Suyu and Zhaiping, light fires on the edges of wheat fields and autumn seedling fields that night. As a result, more than 12,800 mu of wheat fields and autumn seedlings in the 13 villages were spared from frost damage; only Hongshui and Nantan villages suffered the death of cotton and autumn crops on 5.5 mu because they prepared too little firewood and were slow to light the fires. The decision pointed out that the CPC Lan County Committee and the CPC Wu Township First District Committee led the masses to successfully overcome the freeze disaster, keeping tens of thousands of mu of wheat fields and autumn seedlings intact. However, individual villages in the same area at the same time did not do so, and the wheat fields and autumn seedlings suffered considerable damage. This shows that the idea of relying on heaven for food is wrong, and the principle that man will conquer nature is completely correct.
    [Qinyuan News from this newspaper] In Qinyuan County, Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, nine villages including Chengguan used the method of burning fires on the edges of the fields to change the climate, overcome frost, and protect more than 4,000 mu of wheat seedlings and all autumn seedlings from frost damage. On May 19th, a strong wind suddenly rose, and the climate suddenly changed. By the afternoon, the weather was even colder, but the weather suddenly cleared up again. According to experienced farmers, this was a sign of frost. At that time, wheat was heading, and autumn seedlings were also sprouting, unable to resist the invasion of frost. If manpower was not used for prevention, losses would be inevitable. Under the urgent instructions of the county people's government and the CPC county committee, all cadres, party members, and league members in nine villages including Chengguan, Siwei, and Beiyuan actively responded and took the lead. That night, they organized and led all the masses to light fires and emit smoke everywhere in the wind outlets, intersections, and field edges to melt the cold air and change the temperature. According to an on-the-spot inspection on May 20th, 4,632 mu of wheat seedlings and all autumn seedlings in the nine villages were developing normally and showed no signs of injury. However, villages such as Licheng, Shangshe, Zeshan, and Dianji in the third district, which did not burn fires for defense, suffered severe frost damage, and early-planted jade corn, millet, small flax, vegetables, etc. were all frozen. The county's leading organs have circulated the successful experience of frost prevention in Chengguan and other nine villages to the entire county for study and commended them.

　　中共岚县县委及武乡一区区委
    领导群众战胜冻灾
    沁源城关等九村燃火防霜收效很大
    【太原讯】山西日报消息：五月间中共岚县县委及武乡一区区委，领导六十余村群众“燃火防冻”，战胜了自然灾害，中共山西省委特作出决定，予以表扬。岚县于五月二十一日，气候突然发生变化，中共县委预料次日晨可能发生冻灾，为防止田禾受冻，立即召开紧急会议，研究对策。当即动员和抽调县级各机关及二、三区党员干部，共五十余人，星夜赶往容易受冻的一、三区之间五十四个自然村，发动群众进行燃火防冻。次日鸡叫时，一齐点火，漫山遍野烟火冲天，气候逐渐变暖，保证了五十四个村的田禾完好无损。中共武乡县第一区委员会，根据去春该区田禾受冻的教训，春耕下种后，即提出“人定胜天，保苗如保命”的口号，号召大家预防冻灾。各村成立了防冻防霜委员会，设立了三百个防冻防霜台。接着有重点地发动容易受冻的十八个村，堆积了十万多斤柴，以防气候万一变化，就地点燃。五月五日狂风骤起，气候突然变化，区委当即建议区政府和苏峪、寨坪等十三村当晚在麦地和秋苗地边点火。因此，十三村一万二千八百多亩麦田、秋苗免遭冻害；只有洪水、南滩两村因为准备柴少，点火迟慢，冻死棉花、秋禾五亩五分。决定中指出：中共岚县县委和武乡一区区委，领导群众胜利地战胜了冻灾，使数万亩麦田秋苗完好无损，而同一地区同一时间内个别村子没有这样作，麦田秋苗都受到相当严重的损害，这说明靠天吃饭的思想是错误的，而人定胜天的道理则完全正确。
    【本报沁源讯】山西长治专区沁源县城关等九村，用地边烧火办法，改变气候，战胜风霜，保护了四千多亩麦苗和所有秋苗未受霜灾。五月十九日，大风骤起，气候突变，至下午天气更冷，但天气又忽然变晴。据有经验的农民说，这是下风霜的征兆。其时，小麦正在抽穗，秋苗亦正萌芽，对风霜的侵袭无力抗拒，如不用人力预防，必遭损失。在该县人民政府及中共县委紧急指示下，城关、四维、北院等九村，全体干部、党员、团员遂积极响应，首起带头，在当天夜里，组织领导全体群众，在风口、路口、地边到处点火冒烟，熔化冷气，改变气温。据五月二十日实地检验，九个村四千六百三十二亩麦苗及所有秋苗，均发育正常，毫无受伤现象。而未烧火防御的三区李城、上社、泽山、店基等村，遭受严重霜灾，早种的玉茭、谷子、小麻、菜蔬等全被冻坏。该县领导机关已将此次城关等九村防霜胜利的经验，通报全县学习，并予以表扬。
