　　Yoshida Violates the Potsdam Declaration and Infringes on Human Rights
    Japanese Communist Party Files Lawsuit with the Court
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] The Japanese Communist Party filed a lawsuit with the Tokyo District Court on the 16th, demanding the cancellation of the illegal measures of "purging" 41 JCP leaders and members by the Yoshida government last week, based on MacArthur's instructions. According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch: The JCP named Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida as the defendant and filed the lawsuit, accusing him of illegal behavior based on the following reasons: First, the "purge" violates the basic human rights guaranteed by the Potsdam Declaration and the human rights guaranteed by the Japanese Constitution. Second, applying the "purge order" to the Communist Party is unreasonable, because the purpose of the "purge order" is to restrict the activities of militarism, while the Communist Party has been fighting against militarism. Third, not all of the seventeen people who were "purged" because of their involvement with the Akahata newspaper are actually related to the newspaper.
    The Tokyo District Court rejected the JCP's lawsuit under the pretext of "lacking proper legal procedures." Haruhiko Tanaka, Director-General of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Yoshida government's Ministry of Justice, stated that no Japanese agency has the power to adjudicate "administrative actions such as purges."

　　吉田违反波茨坦宣言侵犯人权
    日共向法院提出控诉
    【新华社十七日讯】日本共产党十六日向东京地方法院提起控诉，要求取消上周吉田政府根据麦克阿瑟的指令对日共领袖及党员四十一名实行“整肃”的非法措施。据路透社东京讯：日共指名首相吉田茂为被告，提出诉讼，并以下列理由，控告他的违法行为：第一，该项“整肃”违反波茨坦宣言所保障的基本人权，也违反日本宪法所保障的人权。第二，把“整肃令”应用于共产党是不合理的，因为“整肃令”的目的是限制军国主义的活动，而共产党则一直为反对军国主义而斗争。第三，因与赤旗报有关而被“整肃”的十七个人，并非全部均与该报有关。
    东京地方法院对日共这一控诉，已以“缺少适当诉讼手续”为借口，加以拒绝。吉田政府法务府民事法务长官田中治彦称：没有一个日本机关有权力裁判“像整肃这类的行政行动”。
