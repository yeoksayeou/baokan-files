Article 5: The Construction Bureau shall charge a permit fee of one per mille of the project's estimated value (calculated in millet) for issuing various construction permits. Projects of troops, schools, and non-enterprise units may be exempt from the permit fee. If the permit fee is less than one *jin* of millet, it shall be collected at the equivalent price of one *jin*.

Article 6:  The Construction Bureau shall issue a completion report form along with the construction permit. The applicant shall, within three days after the completion of the project, report to the Construction Bureau and request them to dispatch personnel to inspect the necessary parts of the construction process. The Construction Bureau will issue a construction report form, designating a time for requesting an inspection. Continued construction is only permitted after the inspection has been passed.

Article 7:  If it is intended to change the construction method or quantity of a project that has already obtained a permit, the original permit shall be submitted for application of change, and construction may only continue after approval.

Article 8:  No public or private buildings shall encroach on roads or obstruct ditches. If there are regulations regarding building foundation lines, ditch lines, and lake or riverbank lines, they shall be adhered to during new construction, reconstruction, and renovation.

Article 9:  During the rainy season, for buildings found to be in a state of imminent collapse or other dangerous condition that require urgent repairs, construction may be commenced immediately after reporting, provided that there is no encroachment on the building foundation line or riverbank line, and a permit shall be obtained retroactively.

Article 10: The Construction Bureau may impose restrictions on the location, use, area, height, appearance, structure, and equipment of buildings, depending on the surrounding environment.

Article 11: After the completion of the project, all remaining debris must be removed.

Article 12: Converting ordinary residential houses or shops for other purposes that involve public safety and tranquility, and expanding power equipment in existing factories, must first be reported to the Construction Bureau for approval.

Article 13: The Construction Bureau may dispatch personnel at any time to inspect the structure and equipment of factories and public places.

Article 14: If a building endangers public safety and tranquility, the Construction Bureau may, at its discretion, notify the owner or user to cease using the building, and set a time limit for repairs, improvements, or demolition.

Article 15: Those who violate these regulations may be fined by the Construction Bureau at a rate of one to ten percent of the project's estimated value (calculated in millet), or be subject to crackdown jointly by the Construction Bureau and the Public Security Bureau.

Article 16: These regulations shall come into effect on the date of promulgation. (Yesterday's Article 12 "...existing factories expanding power 'equipment'..." was mistakenly printed as power "work," hereby corrected.)
