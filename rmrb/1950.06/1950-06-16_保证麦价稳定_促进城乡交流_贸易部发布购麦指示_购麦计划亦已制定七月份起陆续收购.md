　　Guarantee Wheat Price Stability, Promote Urban-Rural Exchange
　　Ministry of Trade Issues Wheat Purchase Instructions
　　Wheat Purchase Plan Also Formulated, Gradual Purchases Starting in July
Xinhua News Agency, dated the 14th: The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, in order to guarantee the stability of wheat prices, to take care of farmers' lives, and to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, issued the "Instructions on Grain Companies Purchasing Wheat in 1950" on the 13th.
　　The instructions pointed out: This year, when purchasing wheat, the standard for measuring work performance should be the policy of maintaining an appropriate ratio between wheat and rice prices, rather than completing the numerical target. If wheat prices in some areas fall sharply and cannot maintain the national wheat price standard stipulated by the Ministry of Trade, a request can be submitted to the Ministry of Trade for approval to appropriately increase the purchase volume; if wheat prices in some areas exceed the stipulated standard, purchases can be appropriately reduced or temporarily suspended.
　　The instructions require all localities to have long-term storage plans before purchasing, and to pay attention to the quality and moisture content during purchasing, adhering to the principles of dryness, cleanliness, easy storage, and prevention of mold.
　　The instructions require state-owned specialized companies in all localities to effectively cooperate with each other during the purchasing period. Grain companies should support purchases with coarse grains; department stores, coal companies, cotton yarn and cloth companies, salt companies, and other companies should sell various physical goods in wheat purchasing areas to cooperate.
　　The instructions require local administrative departments to vigorously support the purchasing work, allocate cadres, and quickly establish and improve organizations for purchasing grain; and widely integrate with rural cooperatives to complete the wheat purchasing task. The instructions also require all localities to earnestly study and solve warehouse problems.

　　保证麦价稳定  促进城乡交流
    贸易部发布购麦指示
    购麦计划亦已制定七月份起陆续收购
    【新华社十四日讯】中央人民政府贸易部为了保证小麦价格的稳定，以照顾农民生活，和促进城乡物资交流起见，于十三日发布了“关于一九五零年粮食公司收购小麦的指示”。
    指示指出：今年收购小麦时，应以保持麦、米适当比例的麦价政策为测量工作成绩的标准，而不以完成数字为标准。有的地方如果麦价下跌甚剧，不能保持贸易部所规定的全国麦价标准时，可呈报贸易部批准，适当增加收购量；有的地方如果麦价超过规定标准，则可适当少收或暂时停收。
    指示要求各地在收购之前应有长期保管的打算，收购时须注意质量和水分的程度，务以干燥、洁净、容易保管和不致霉坏为原则。
    指示要求各地各国营专业公司应在收购期内互相有力地配合进行工作。粮食公司要以粗粮支持收购；百货、煤业、花纱布、盐业等公司要在购麦地区出卖各项实物，予以配合。
    该指示要求各地行政部门必须大力支持收购工作，配备干部，迅速建立与健全收购粮食的机构；并广泛结合农村合作社，以完成购麦任务。该指示并要求各地切实研究解决仓库问题。
