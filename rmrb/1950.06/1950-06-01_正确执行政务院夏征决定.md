　　Correctly Implement the Government Administration Council's Summer Grain Collection Decision

    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has announced the decision on the summer grain collection in the newly liberated areas for 1950. This is a new decision made under the circumstances of the near-total victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the realization of unprecedented national financial unification by the Central People's Government, the end of twelve years of inflation, the stabilization of prices, and the basic overcoming of disasters. The significant implications of this decision are not actually limited to the scope of the summer grain collection in the newly liberated areas. It will inevitably have a positive impact on the entire national economy of our country.

    The decision stipulates that this year's summer national grain, as a portion of the annual national grain, shall not exceed 13 percent of the total summer harvest yield on average, calculated on the basis of large administrative areas; the local surcharge, calculated on a provincial basis, shall not exceed 15 percent of the national grain collection. Exempt households, calculated on a district basis, shall not exceed 20 percent of the total number of households with summer harvests. Of particular importance is the stipulation of the maximum rates for the progressive summer grain collection from all classes, namely: no more than 10 percent for poor peasants; no more than 15 percent for middle peasants; no more than 25 percent for rich peasants; no more than 50 percent for landlords; and no more than 80 percent for special households. This proportion of the burden is in line with the actual conditions in the rural areas of the newly liberated areas and is very fair and reasonable. This proportion of the burden applies not only to this year's summer grain collection but also to this year's autumn grain collection. Previously, the Government Administration Council stipulated that the collection of public grain in the new areas should not exceed 17 percent of the total agricultural income, and the collection from landlords should not exceed 60 percent of their total agricultural income. The figures now stipulated are obviously reduced compared to before. This reduction in the burden is, of course, beneficial to the recovery and development of the national economy, especially the vast rural economy.

    For the past twelve years, the Chinese people, especially the peasants, have contributed enormous manpower and material resources to the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War. In the revised 1950 national revenue budget in February this year, public grain revenue still accounts for 37.2 percent, and the average burden on farmers nationwide still accounts for about 17 percent of their total agricultural income. This burden was necessary under the circumstances at the time. However, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, relying on the support of the broad masses of the people and the efforts of the working cadres, economizing on expenditures as much as possible, overcoming difficulties; the People's Liberation Army fighting bravely on the front lines and participating in production in the rear; and especially the implementation of correct fiscal and economic policies and the efforts in disaster relief, we have finally overcome serious difficulties and disasters, and have brought the fiscal balance close to equilibrium, stopped the twelve years of inflation, and presented a new situation of financial and price stability. This makes it possible for us to strive to appropriately reduce the burden on the people. On December 2nd last year, Chairman Mao Zedong said at a meeting of the Central People's Government Committee: "Our situation can be summarized as: there are difficulties, there are solutions, and there is hope." The facts of the past six months have proven Mao Zedong's foresight. The Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, following Chairman Mao's instructions, will never increase the burden on the people unless absolutely necessary; and as long as there is any possibility, we must find ways to reduce the burden on the people, so as to allow the people to recuperate and develop production. The Government Administration Council's decision on the summer grain collection in the newly liberated areas is the beginning of a series of new tasks. In accordance with the Common Program's economic policies, the Central People's Government will continue to adjust the five types of economies in all aspects under the leadership of the state-owned economy, implement overall planning, and correct certain deviations and errors in the implementation of policies in the past.

    However, it should be brought to our serious attention that although our country's financial and economic situation has begun to improve, it has not fundamentally improved. Many difficulties still lie before us. In order to ensure the victory of the Liberation War and the needs of production and construction, continue to overcome difficulties, and prevent possible disasters, we still have arduous work to do in terms of finance and taxation. Previously, tax authorities and responsible cadres in various localities, with loyalty and dedication, tirelessly completed tax collection, which should be commended. Some instances of excessively light or heavy taxation, as well as phenomena of exceeding the progressive tax rates and commandist work styles, should be resolutely corrected. Some tax personnel's failure to comply with the government's tax policies, as well as the corrupt extortion of bad elements, should be reported and punished. And the phenomena of tax evasion or concealment and underreporting should also be ruthlessly exposed. In short, we must adhere to the principle stipulated in the Common Program: "Simplify the tax system and implement a reasonable burden." Everyone must act in accordance with the Common Program.

    The methods stipulated in the decision on the summer grain collection in the new areas are more simplified and reasonable than previous tax collection methods. The leading organs and tax cadres in the areas where the summer grain collection is carried out should carefully study and correctly implement them. On the one hand, it is necessary to resolutely overcome commandist work styles and the one-sided so-called "task" viewpoint. The current "task" is to collect taxes according to the tax rates, which no tax authority at any level may violate; no people's government at any level may adopt the method of increasing the collection amount at each level. As Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi said in his report celebrating May Day, commandism is the main mistake and shortcoming in the current cadre work style. Personnel who make the mistake of commandism "do not complete the tasks given to them by the state and the party within the limits of strictly following the national and party policies, but instead adopt a crude method to carry out their work, not paying attention to the specific situation, disregarding whether it is actually possible, and unwilling to humbly consult with the local people, simply completing the task, as a result of which, the task is completed, but the people suffer avoidable losses." This summer grain collection work is being carried out after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to implement party rectification nationwide, therefore, this summer grain collection should become an important test for rectifying the cadre work style and correcting the mistakes of commandism. On the other hand, responsible personnel of local governments at all levels, especially in areas with large production of wheat and early rice where the summer grain collection is heavy, must regard the completion of the summer grain collection work as a major task, personally going to the countryside, conducting investigations and research, and publicizing and explaining, in order to encourage the masses to enthusiastically pay according to the regulations, and must not be negligent or slack. Because the collection ratio has already been reduced, if the responsible cadres and staff members are complacent and relaxed, and fail to fully raise the political consciousness of the people in the new areas, serious passivity, concealment, evasion, and corruption may occur; which will seriously affect the state's fiscal revenue. As a result, it will undermine the new situation of national fiscal balance, financial and price stability that we have worked so hard to create in the past six months. Therefore, we must work hard, strictly abide by the decision of the Government Administration Council, complete the summer grain collection work in the new areas, and consolidate the unprecedented new situation of our financial economy, so that our national economy can be smoothly restored and developed.

### 正确执行政务院夏征决定

　　正确执行政务院夏征决定
    中央人民政府政务院公布了关于一九五○年新解放区夏征公粮的决定。这是在中国人民解放战争接近全面胜利、中央人民政府实现了史无前例的全国财政统一、结束了十二年来的通货膨胀、稳定了物价和基本上战胜了灾荒的条件下的一项新的决定。这个决定的重要意义，实际上并不限于新解放区夏征公粮的范围。它对于我国整个国民经济必将发生良好的影响。
    这个决定，规定了本年夏季的国家公粮，作为全年公粮的一部分，其征收总额，以大行政区为单位，平均不得超过夏收正产物总额的百分之十三；地方附加以省为单位，不得超过国家公粮征收额的百分之十五。免征户以区为单位，不得超过有夏收的总户数的百分之二十。尤其重要的，是规定了对各阶层的夏季公粮累进征收的最高额，即：贫农最高不得超过百分之十；中农最高不得超过百分之十五；富农最高不得超过百分之二十五；地主最高不得超过百分之五十；特殊户最高不得超过百分之八十。这个负担的比例和新解放区农村的实际情况是吻合的，是十分公平合理的。这个负担的比例不但适用于今年的夏征，而且也适用于今年的秋征。前此，政务院规定新区征收公粮不及农业总收入百分之十七；对地主征收额最高不超过其农业总收入的百分之六十。现在规定的数字，显然是比以前减轻了。这种负担的减轻，对于国民经济，特别是广大农村经济的恢复与发展，当然是有利的。
    十二年来，中国人民，特别是农民，为抗日战争和人民解放战争，贡献了巨大的人力物力。在今年二月改订的一九五○年度国家收入概算中，公粮收入仍占百分之三十七点二，全国农民平均负担，仍占其农业总收入的百分之十七上下。这个负担在当时的情况下是必需的。但在中央人民政府和中国共产党的领导下，依靠广大人民的支持和工作干部的努力，尽量节省开支，克服困难；人民解放军在前线英勇作战，在后方参加生产；尤其是正确的财政经济政策的实施和救灾工作的努力，我们终于克服了严重的困难和灾荒，并使财政收支接近平衡，停止了十二年来的通货膨胀，出现了金融和物价趋于稳定的新局面。这就使我们有可能争取适当地减轻人民的负担。去年十二月二日，毛泽东主席在中央人民政府委员会的会议上说：“我们的情况概括地说来就是：有困难的，有办法的，有希望的。”近半年间的事实已经证明了毛主席的预见。中央人民政府和中国共产党，遵照毛主席的指示，非万不得已，决不加重人民的负担；而只要有一点可能，就一定要设法减轻人民的负担，以便于人民休养生息，恢复与发展生产。此次政务院关于新解放区夏征公粮的决定，正是一系列新的工作的开始。按照共同纲领的经济政策，中央人民政府还将继续在国营经济领导下从各个方面来调整五种经济，实行统筹兼顾，纠正过去在政策执行中的某些偏向和错误。
    但是，应该引起我们严重注意的是：我们国家的财政经济情况，虽然已经开始好转了，却还没有根本好转。在我们的面前，仍然摆着许多困难。为了保证解放战争的胜利和生产建设的需要，继续克服困难，防止可能发生的灾害，我们在财政税收方面还要进行艰巨的工作。前此各地税收机关和负责干部，忠心耿耿，任劳任怨，完成税收，这是应该受到嘉勉的。税收中有些畸轻畸重及超过征收累进率的现象和命令主义的作风，应该坚决加以纠正。有些税务人员不遵守政府的税收政策，以及坏分子的贪污勒索行为，应予检举与处罚。而逃避税收或隐瞒漏报的现象，亦应无情地加以揭发。总之，我们要坚持共同纲领所规定的原则：“简化税制，实行合理负担。”人人都要按照共同纲领办事。
    此次新区夏征公粮的决定中所规定的办法，其简化与合理的程度，比前此各项税收办法进了一步。在夏征工作地区的领导机关和税收干部，应该认真研究，正确执行。在一方面，要坚决克服命令主义作风和片面的所谓“任务”观点。现在的“任务”就是按照税率征收，各级税收机关不得违背；各级人民政府不得采用层层增加征收数额的办法。正如刘少奇副主席在庆祝五一节报告中所说，命令主义是目前干部作风中的主要错误和缺点。犯命令主义错误的工作人员“不是在严格遵循国家的和党的政策的限度内去完成国家和党给予他们的任务，而是采取一种粗暴的方法去进行工作，不去注意具体的情况，不顾及事实上是否可能，不肯虚心地和当地人民商量，只是简单地去完成任务，结果，任务是完成了，人民却受到了本来可以避免的损失”。这次夏征工作进行于中国共产党中央决定在全国实行整党以后，因此这次夏征应当成为整顿干部作风和纠正命令主义错误的重要考验。在另一方面，各地区，尤其是大量出产小麦、早稻，夏征工作繁重的地区，各级地方政府的负责人员，又必须把完成夏征工作当作重大的任务，亲自下乡，调查研究，宣传解释，以求群众踊跃照章缴纳，千万不可疏忽懈怠。因为征收比例业已减低，如果负责干部和工作人员麻痹松懈，没有充分地提高新区人民的政治觉悟，就可能发生严重的消极懈怠、隐瞒偷漏和贪污现象；就将严重地影响国家的财政收入。其结果，就将会破坏我们半年来辛苦努力所造成的国家财政收支接近平衡、金融和物价趋于稳定的新局面。因此，我们必须紧张努力，严格遵守政务院的决定，完成新区的夏征工作，巩固我国空前未有的财政经济的新局面，使我们的国民经济能够顺利地恢复与发展起来。
