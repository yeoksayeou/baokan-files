China's Silk Industry Has a Promising Future
Further Answers to Readers' Questions from the Raw Materials Department of the Ministry of Agriculture

Comrade Zhou Hengjun:
    The Raw Materials Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has answered your questions as follows:

    (1) Can artificial fibers replace silk?

    Although artificial fibers can replace some uses of raw silk, the production and consumption of silk account for a very small proportion of the total production and consumption of various fibers in the world. Due to the upward trend in people's living standards, silk has a promising future. Fabrics made of rayon and silk are also in considerable demand for export. Therefore, the rayon industry can cooperate and develop simultaneously with the silk industry.

    Nylon is inferior to silk in terms of heat retention, moisture absorption, and tensile strength. Therefore, the silk industry should not be abandoned due to the development of rayon.

    (2) The importance of silk to China

    China has a vast silk-producing area. Silkworm rearing has a short production cycle, rapid capital turnover, and the silkworm season is during the agricultural slack season. Moreover, mulberry land is not limited by soil quality or terrain. Therefore, silkworm rearing is one of the important sideline productions in rural China. This spring, East China's purchase of silkworm cocoons stipulated a central standard price of 3.5 dan of rice per dan of cocoons. This not only takes care of the interests of farmers but also contains the important significance of developing agricultural production and prospering the rural economy. Moreover, silk reeling, spun silk, and silk product industries can accommodate a large amount of labor (it is estimated that more than 20 million people nationwide rely directly and indirectly on the silk industry for their livelihoods).

    At present, China is still lacking in fiber raw materials. If we no longer import cotton, hemp, wool, and rayon, we will have to supplement with other fibers. Therefore, as long as domestic silk faces the broad masses, changes weaving methods, reduces costs, shifts from extravagance to simplicity, and meets practical needs, it can make domestic fiber raw materials self-sufficient and save foreign exchange for importing other fibers.

    (3) The silk industry has a promising future

    If silk is researched and improved, it can also be used as inner lining cloth for aircraft and automobile tires, wire covering materials, bolting cloth for the flour milling industry, aviation parachutes, gunpowder bag silk, and materials for national flags and other flags. This year, Czechoslovakia wanted us to sell them several tons of raw silk with a thickness of 0.03 mm for trial use as electrical wire. This is a very good example.

    Now, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, India, Iran, and other countries that originally produced very little or no silk are paying great attention to basic work such as mulberry planting and silkworm rearing, regarding the silk industry as an emerging industry. It can be seen that the demand for raw silk in various countries is quite strong.

    For more than ten years, due to the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, China's silk exports have been bleak. This is an undeniable fact. Now, China's silk has new markets in the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries in Eastern Europe. The original international markets can still be striven for.

    In short, the current policy of the People's Government towards the silk industry is to maintain the original production level as a principle, gradually renew mulberry gardens, promote improved silkworm varieties, eliminate local varieties, and lay the foundation for the restoration and development of the silk industry. This policy is correct.

### 中国蚕丝业是有发展前途的  农业部工业原料司再答读者问

　　中国蚕丝业是有发展前途的
    农业部工业原料司再答读者问周恒君：
    你的问题，已由中央人民政府农业部工业原料司答复如下：
    （一）人造纤维是否能代替蚕丝？
    人造纤维虽可代替一部分生丝用途，但蚕丝产量和消费量在世界各种纤维总生产量与总消费量中，占着极小的地位。由于人类生活水准向上发展的趋势，蚕丝是有它的发展前途的。而人造丝与蚕丝的织品在外销上也有相当的需要。因此，人造丝工业可与蚕丝业相互配合、同时发展。
    尼隆的品质，在保温、吸湿、拉力各点，比蚕丝为差。因此不能因人造丝之发达而委弃蚕丝业。
    （二）蚕丝对中国的重要性
    我国蚕丝的产区很广。养蚕生产期短，资金流转快，蚕期为农闲时期，而桑地又不限土质、地势。所以，养蚕业是我国农村的重要副业生产之一。今春华东收购蚕茧，规定每担中心标准价格合九二米三石五斗。这除了照顾农民利益外，还包含着发展农业生产、繁荣农村经济的重要意义。而且缫丝、绢纺以及丝制品工业可容纳大量人工（估计全国直接间接靠蚕丝业生活的人在二千万人以上）。
    目前我国纤维原料，尚感缺乏。倘不再进口棉花、麻、毛和人造丝，势必要以其他纤维补充。因此，国产蚕丝只要面向广大群众，改变织造方式，减低成本，由浮华转变为朴实，切合实用，便可以使国内纤维原料自给和节约其他纤维输入的外汇。
    （三）蚕丝事业是有前途的
    蚕丝如加以研究改进，还可以用作飞机及汽车轮胎内贴布、电线被覆料、制粉业用筛绢、航空降落伞、火药包用绸料、以及国旗和其他旗帜的材料。今年捷克要我们卖给他们○·○三公厘粗细的生丝若干吨，试作电线丝。这就是很好的例子。
    现在苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、伊朗等原来产丝极少或素不产丝的国家都很注重栽桑、养蚕等基本工作，视蚕丝业为新兴事业。可见各国对于生丝的需要，是相当殷切的。
    十余年来由于国民党反动派的统治，我国蚕丝外销暗淡。这是不可否认的事实。现在我国的蚕丝在苏联及东欧各新民主主义国家已有新的市场。而过去原有之国际市场仍可努力争取。
    总之，人民政府当前对蚕丝业的方针采取以维持原有的生产水平为原则，逐步更新桑园，推广优良蚕种，消灭土种，打下恢复与发展蚕丝业的基础，这个方针是正确的。
