[News Dispatch from the Beijing Municipal News Office] The Beijing Xin Pharmacy Labor-Management Collective Contract was approved by the Municipal Labor Bureau on June 1st and is now being implemented. In order to implement this contract, the industry's Labor-Management Consultation Conference is now promoting the establishment of labor-management consultation conferences in various stores, in accordance with the principles of the collective contract, and to separately establish small contracts based on the business conditions of each store.

There are a total of 155 Xin Pharmacies in Beijing, with 124 participating in the implementation of the collective contract involving employer-employee relationships, totaling 545 employees. When the representatives of labor and management in the industry began to consider drafting the contract and drafting their own drafts under the leadership of the Labor Bureau, the chief representatives of both sides often exchanged opinions to first solve the problems that could be easily agreed upon. After the drafts were drawn up, informal consultations and studies were repeatedly carried out to gradually achieve consistency in the content of the two drafts. Therefore, this contract only held three formal consultations before fully reaching an agreement. The first article of the contract clearly stipulates that the employer or its agent has the right to command and decide within the scope of business, and the employees should obey its command; however, the employer should respect the reasonable suggestions of the trade union. In order to reasonably solve the difficulties of employers in handling employees when changing careers or transferring property rights, and to take care of the occupational problems of the labor side, the contract stipulates: "When the employer changes the production method or changes careers in accordance with the law, employees who can change production methods or careers at any time will no longer be paid severance pay," "When the employer's property rights are transferred, if the employee is retained by the new owner, the old owner will no longer pay severance pay." The wage provisions are also based on the different business conditions of each store and the employee's own technical proficiency, length of service, etc., and set three minimum standards: A, B, and C. In this way, on the one hand, the minimum living standard of workers is taken care of, and on the other hand, the employer is encouraged to actively operate, making the collective contract easy to implement throughout the industry.

　　经过多次协商全部获得协议
    新药业订立劳资集体合同
    各商店劳资双方正分别订立小型合同
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市新药业劳资集体合同，已于六月一日经市劳动局批准执行；该业劳资协商会议为了执行这个合同，现正推动各商店建立劳资协商会议，遵照集体合同的原则，根据各家营业情况分别订立小型合同。
    京市新药业共有一百五十五家，有雇佣关系参加执行集体合同的有一百二十四家，共有职工五百四十五人。该业劳资双方代表，在劳动局领导下，开始酝酿订立合同及各自起草合同草案时，双方首席代表就时常交换意见，先解决容易取得协议的问题；在草案拟出后，又一再进行非正式的协商、研究，使两个草案的内容逐渐取得一致，因此，这个合同先后只举行了三次正式协商，就全部获得协议。合同的第一条明确规定了资方或其代理人，在业务范围内有指挥权及决定权，职工应服从其指挥；但资方应尊重工会之合理建议。为了合理解决资方在转业或转移产权时处理职工的困难，和照顾劳方的职业问题，合同中规定：“资方改变生产方式或依法转业时，其能随时改变生产方式转业之职工，不再发给解雇费”，“资方产权转移时，职工如被新业主留用，旧业主不再发给解雇费”。对于工资的规定，也是根据各号营业情况的不同和职工本人技术熟练程度、服务年限等，订出甲、乙、丙三种最低标准。这样，一方面照顾了工人的最低生活，更鼓舞了资方积极经营，使集体合同在整个行业中易于贯彻执行。
