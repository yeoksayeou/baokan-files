Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 8th: Chongqing's state-owned trading companies are actively supporting local private factories and businesses to overcome their current difficulties.

The Southwest China Branch of the China Department Store Corporation purchased finished products from the toothbrush, cotton textile, and glass industries in May, partially resolving the difficulties of sluggish sales and insufficient funds. This enabled fourteen toothbrush factories, Yuhua Cloth Factory, Tiancheng Glass Factory, and handicraft shoe factories, which were in a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown, to resume production. To date, the company has purchased a total of 13.4 billion yuan worth of general merchandise, of which 70% was from private factories. By mid-May, the Southwest China Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation had purchased 1,658 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn and 51,313 bolts of various types of cloth from private factories, paying 21 billion yuan. In March and April, the company provided over 43,400 dan (a unit of weight) of cotton to private textile factories for processing, of which Shenxin and Yuxin factories received over 10,100 dan, resolving the factories' entire raw cotton needs. The company also signed processing contracts for 20,000 bolts of mosquito netting cloth with Yuhua Cloth Factory, Yuxin Yarn Factory, and Daming Cloth Factory, and entrusted local handloom weavers to weave 20,000 bolts, enabling the long-suspended handloom weavers to resume work. The company also appropriately adjusted market cotton yarn prices during the purchasing process, stabilizing the previously declining yarn prices. The company is now preparing to continue signing processing contracts with various factories. The Southwest China Branch of the China Native Produce Corporation, in conjunction with private merchants, vigorously purchased bristles and sheepskins, releasing a total of 36.2 billion yuan in cash, enabling more than 80 bristle washing factories, which had been completely shut down before liberation, to resume operation. By the end of April, the Southwest China Branch of the China Oil Corporation had purchased 1,076 tons of tung oil. To date, the total amount of cash invested by the above state-owned companies in purchasing goods has reached 128.4 billion yuan.

The Southwest Industrial Supply and Marketing Company places monthly orders with various coal mines, partially resolving the problem of sluggish sales of coal mine products. The state-owned factories and power companies under the Southwest Industrial Department have approved the amount of coal to be used from May to September and have ordered more than 12,000 tons of coal from private coal mines such as Donglin, Tianfu, and Fuxing. In the future, orders will continue to be placed with various public and private coal mines according to actual needs. The ordering prices and specifications are determined through negotiation between both parties.

In addition, the Southwest China Branch of the China Grain Corporation has successively supplied more than 78,000 shi (a unit of volume) of rice to more than 40 rice mills for processing, assisting the factories in maintaining production. Other industries such as alcohol, rubber, towels, knitwear, native cloth, and coal mines have also received large government orders. The rubber industry has successively manufactured 788,800 pairs of rubber shoes, and some alcohol factories that were completely shut down have resumed production due to government orders.

Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 4th: Qingdao's state-owned enterprises are vigorously supporting private enterprises to overcome the temporary difficulties of sluggish sales and insufficient capital turnover. In the past three months, various state-owned companies have supported more than ten industries, including textile, printing and dyeing, rubber, flour milling, machine manufacturing, knitting, and embroidery, through processing, ordering, and consignment sales. A total of more than 21,000 bolts of cloth were entrusted for processing, more than 90,000 bolts of various patterned cloths were printed and dyed, 147,000 flour sacks and a large quantity of miscellaneous woven goods were woven, 150,000 pairs of rubber shoes were made, 260 tons of fishplate and electric pole hook screws were processed, 330 tons of round and flat iron were pressed, more than 1.76 million jin (a unit of weight) of grain were milled, and more than 3 million jin of various grains were consigned for sale by cooperatives, grain stores, and commercial firms. In addition, a large quantity of soap and miscellaneous woven goods were exchanged for raw materials. Among the city's 330 textile enterprises, those processing for the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch accounted for more than 95%. Most factories have shifted from intermittent operation in the past to day and night operation. For example, Lixin Weaving Factory only intermittently operated three or five machines in the past. After processing for the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, all twelve machines are now operating day and night. The larger Huaxin Textile Company once had difficulty maintaining production due to sluggish sales and the inability to circulate funds. After the state-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and Trust Company successively purchased and consigned 3,400 bolts of finished cloth and 170 pieces of yarn, and signed a contract with it to process 1,200 pieces of spun yarn, production has now returned to normal. The 91 flour mills and 130 merchants entrusted by the Grain Corporation to process and sell grain have also overcome difficulties and resumed production and operation.
