　　People's Bank of Taizhou Branch
    Private Industrial and Commercial Loans Increase Monthly
    [Our Su Bei News] The People's Bank of Taizhou Branch, adhering to the principle of considering both public and private interests, concentrates a large amount of capital to support private industry and commerce. Since January of this year, the outstanding loan balance of the bank to private industry and commerce has been greater than the bank's monthly private deposit balance, and the amount has also increased month by month. The loan balance at the end of January was 101.87 percent of the deposit balance, 539.12 percent at the end of February, 219.8 percent at the end of March, 397.7 percent at the end of April, and 430.1 percent at the end of May, amounting to 749.67 million yuan.
    Since January, February, and March, in addition to vigorously cooperating with the government in promoting the People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds, and withdrawing more than 5.7 billion yuan of currency from circulation, in order to smash the enemy's maritime blockade conspiracy and vigorously develop inland water and land transportation, the bank has lent a large amount of funds to support transportation industries such as ships and automobiles. According to incomplete statistics, with the direct assistance of the bank, six ships and thirty-eight automobiles were refitted (converted to charcoal stoves). In addition, the bank also helped Taizhou Zhentai Electric Light Company repair a 150-horsepower gas generator, so that the Taizhou Electric Light Plant, which had the greatest difficulties, could continue to supply electricity. It also provided a huge loan of more than 330 million yuan to help Huatai Yarn Factory relocate smoothly, enabling the factory's spindles to increase from more than 1,100 to 4,000, and built a new factory.
    However, because the bank's understanding of policies is not comprehensive and thorough enough, and no specific methods for implementing loan policies have been formulated, some shortcomings have arisen. For example, the investigation and understanding of private manufacturers are not in-depth. The three ordering loans of more than 500 million yuan to Taizhou Flour Mill resulted in the manager running away and forming a bad debt because the factory engaged in speculation and its labor-management relations were abnormal. The loan to Zhentai Electric Light Company could not be repaid because the company's organization was unreasonable, and its expenses were huge, resulting in accumulated debts. Also, for some loan accounts, the term has expired, but the bank has not actively collected them, so that the funds or materials originally prepared for repayment have been spent. All of these need to be improved in the future.

### 人民银行泰州支行  私营工商贷款逐月增加

　　人民银行泰州支行
    私营工商贷款逐月增加
    【本报苏北讯】中国人民银行泰州支行，本公私兼顾原则，集中大批资金扶植私营工商业。该行自今年一月以来对私营工商业贷款余额逐月均大于该行各月之私营存款余额，金额亦逐月增加。计一月底贷款余额为存款余额的百分之一○一·八七，二月底为百分之五三九·一二，三月底为百分之二一九·八，四月底为百分之三九七·七，五月底为百分之四三○·一，金额为七亿四千九百六十七万元。
    该行从一、二、三月份以来，除大力配合政府推销人民胜利折实公债，回笼货币五十七亿余元外，为粉碎敌人海上封锁阴谋，大力发展内地水陆运输，曾贷出大批款项扶助轮船、汽车等交通事业。据不完全统计，在该行直接帮助下，改装（改装木炭炉）了轮船六艘，汽车三十八辆。此外，还帮助了泰州振太电灯公司修理了一百五十匹马力的煤气发电机，使困难最大的泰州电灯厂能继续送电。又以三亿三千余万元的巨额贷款，扶助华太纱厂顺利内迁，使该厂纱锭从一千一百多枚扩增到四千枚，并建筑了新厂。
    但由于该行对政策领会尚不够全面彻底，亦未订出执行贷款政策的具体办法，致产生若干缺点。如对私营厂商调查了解不深入，给泰州面粉厂的三次订货贷款五亿多元，因该厂从事投机活动，劳资关系又不正常，故后来经理逃跑，形成呆账。对振太电灯公司的贷款，亦因该公司组织不合理，开支浩大，积欠累累而无法偿还。又有的贷款户期限已到，而银行亦未主动催收，以致原来准备偿债的款项或物资，又被花消。以上这些今后均亟待改进。
