　　Shang Dexing Manages the Warehouse Well: A Million Jin of Public Grain Suffers No Losses.
    Jianping County Government Commends Him
    Shang Dexing, a public grain storage worker in Jianping County, Hebei Province, was commended by the Jianping County Government for his conscientious work and effective management. The Xiaomiyu granary under his charge stored over 900,000 jin of grain, distributed in nineteen locations, occupying forty-five rooms. Among these granaries, only two were in relatively good condition, while the rest were all dilapidated: some leaked when it rained, and some had walls that were about to collapse. To prevent any losses to the public grain, Comrade Shang Dexing conducted regular inspections. For example, during the continuous rainy season last year, although he lived eight li away from Miyu, he went to inspect the granaries every day. When a house leaked, he patched it with mud. When a wall was about to collapse, he propped it up with wooden pillars. Not only that, but he also mobilized the masses in the whole village to help with the storage.
    Before the public grain was put into the granary, he first spread a layer of wheat chaff in the granary, and then laid mats on top of the chaff. Because the wheat chaff generated heat, it could prevent moisture and avoid mildew. He plans to store 1.2 million jin of wheat this year. To ensure the completion of this year's public grain storage task, he repaired the granaries as early as possible.
    The characteristics of Comrade Shang Dexing's grain storage work can be summarized in the following three points: (1) Attaching importance to state property, not being afraid of hardship, not being afraid of difficulties, and being responsible for regular inspections. (2) Clear division of labor, with each granary having a dedicated person in charge. (3) Connecting with the masses and mobilizing the masses to help with storage.

### 尚德兴管理仓库有方  百万斤公粮未受损失  建屏县政府予以表扬

　　尚德兴管理仓库有方  百万斤公粮未受损失
    建屏县政府予以表扬
    河北省建屏县公粮保管员尚德兴同志，工作认真，管理有方，获得建屏县府的表扬。由他负责管理的小米峪粮库，存粮九十余万斤，分存十九处，占房四十五间。这些库房，只有两处较好，其余全系坏房子：有的下雨漏水，有的墙快倒塌。为了不使公粮遭受损失，尚德兴同志经常进行检查。例如在去年阴雨连绵的雨季，虽然他住的地方离米峪八里地，但他每天都要去检查一次。房子漏了，他就用泥补漏。墙快倒了，就用木柱顶住。不仅这样，他还发动全村群众来帮助保管。
    在公粮入库以前，他先在库房里铺上一层麦糠，麦糠上边再铺席子。因为麦糠发热，可防潮湿，不致发生霉烂。他计划今年保管小麦一百二十万斤。为了保证完成今年贮存公粮的任务，他及早修理了库房。
    尚德兴同志保管公粮工作的特点，总括起来，有以下三点：（一）重视国家资财，不怕吃苦，不畏困难，经常负责检查。（二）分工明确，每个粮库都有专人负责。（三）连系群众，发动群众帮助保管。
