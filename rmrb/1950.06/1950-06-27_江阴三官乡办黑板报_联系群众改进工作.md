Jiangyin Sanguan Township runs blackboards
    Connect with the masses and improve work
    [This newspaper Jiangyin News] Since Sanguan Township in Jiangyin Fortress, Southern Jiangsu Province, started running blackboards in January of this year, it has connected with the broad masses, improved the work of the township, and has been universally welcomed by the peasant masses. As of the beginning of May, the township's blackboard newspaper had published 100 issues, with an average of more than 150 readers per day.
    The Sanguan Township blackboard newspaper has a broad network of correspondents. Most of the more active village cadres, members of the peasant association, teachers, and members of the Communist Youth League in various villages serve as correspondents for the newspaper. They set up manuscript boxes and suggestion boxes in various places to reflect the situation in a timely manner and enrich the source of articles. Over the past five months, the blackboard newspaper has achieved great results in improving the political and cultural level of cadres and the masses, strengthening the ties between cadres and the masses, motivating production enthusiasm, transforming loafers and idlers, and correcting deviations in work. For example, Liang Tugen, a well-known loafer in Sanguan Village, has now actively participated in labor production after being educated and encouraged by the blackboard newspaper. He also often says to people: "If I don't work hard in production, I will not only be sorry to the blackboard newspaper, but also to myself." Another example is Zhou Shunlin, the village chief of Zhoujia Village, who has an undemocratic and selfish style. After being exposed by the blackboard newspaper, the masses put forward serious criticisms, and Zhou Shunlin made a profound self-criticism at the villagers' meeting. Villager Zhang Cailin said to him: "As long as you write a manuscript admitting your mistakes and post it on the blackboard newspaper, we guarantee that you will not make the same mistakes in the future."

　　江阴三官乡办黑板报
    联系群众改进工作
    【本报江阴讯】苏南区江阴要塞三官乡自本年一月间创办黑板报以来，联系广大群众，改进了乡里的工作，普遍得到农民群众的欢迎。至五月上旬为止，该乡的黑板报已出刊一百期，平均每天有读者一百五十人以上。
    三官乡的黑板报有广大的通讯网，各村较积极的村干部、农会会员、教师、青年团员，大部担任该报通讯员。他们在各处设立稿件箱与意见箱，借以及时反映情况，充裕稿源。五个多月来，黑板报对提高干部群众的政治文化水平，密切干部与群众的联系，鼓动生产情绪，改造懒汉二流子，纠正工作中的偏向等方面都收到了很大的成效。如三官村一个有名的懒汉梁土根，经过了黑板报的教育与鼓励，现在已积极参加劳动生产了。他还时常对人说：“我再不好好生产，不要说对不起黑板报，也太对不起自己了。”又如周家村村长周顺林，作风不民主，自私自利，经黑板报揭露后，群众提出了严正的批评，周顺林在村民大会上作了深刻的检讨。村民张才林对他说：“只要你写一篇承认错误的稿子，登在黑板报上，保证以后不再犯就行了。”
