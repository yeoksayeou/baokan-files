Fighting to Thoroughly Eliminate the Invaders: The Korean People

Following the proposal for peaceful unification last June, the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland Front put forward a concrete plan to promote peaceful unification in early June this year, advocating a merger election between the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea and the South Korean puppet National Assembly to achieve national unification. This proposal was unanimously supported by all democratic parties and people from all walks of life in Korea. However, the Syngman Rhee group responded to this just proposal, which conformed to the wishes of all the Korean people, by launching a civil war of fratricide. The purpose of the Syngman Rhee group's instigation of civil war was to seize the great achievements of the people in the north and deprive them of their freedom, return the land already obtained by the people to the landlords, and turn the whole of Korea into a colony of American imperialism.

Although the American army announced its withdrawal from South Korea in June last year, half a year after the withdrawal of the Soviet army, a large American military advisory group still directly controlled the Syngman Rhee group in training, equipping, and directing the Syngman Rhee reactionary army to attack the people's guerrillas, and frequently violated the 38th parallel. From January 1949 to April 1950 alone, the Syngman Rhee bandit army's so-called "northward expedition" provocations reached as many as 1,274 times.

American imperialism directed and participated in 42 naval fleet and 71 air attacks on the North Korean people. Recently, the US imperialists sold a batch of fighter jets to the Syngman Rhee puppet government and built five airports in Jeju, Gwangju, Jungsan, Daegu, and Suwon. Gimpo Airport near Seoul, the largest airport in South Korea, has been repaired by the US imperialists with an expenditure of $40,000. In Heuksan Island, the US imperialists not only established a military base but also set up a radio station to direct the activities of spies and secret agents in various places. As early as 1948, Syngman Rhee signed the "Korean-American Provisional Military Agreement" with Hodge, which stipulated the right of the United States to control and command the Syngman Rhee bandit army. The "Korea Communications" reported on February 17 this year: "Brigadier General Roots, the head of the US military advisory group in Korea, led a certain squadron to fight on the 16th and personally commanded the battle." Even the reactionary newspapers could not hide the fact that the American army was directly involved in the war. On the 16th of this month, the American warmonger Dulles "visited" South Korea and gave a speech in the puppet "National Assembly," openly instigating Syngman Rhee to obstruct peaceful unification and create civil war.

Under the "aid" of American imperialism, the South Korean economy has been driven to complete bankruptcy. Now, the US imperialists have occupied 91.23 percent of the total economic capital of South Korea and 94 percent of the total investment. As a result of the implementation of several traitorous agreements such as the so-called "Korean-American Agreement," "Korean-American Economic Aid Agreement," and "Korean-American Petroleum Agreement," the South Korean economy is rapidly declining. By last year, the United States had invested 1 billion US dollars in South Korea and established various monopoly organizations such as petroleum, shipping, and coal mines, monopolizing the entire South Korean industry. In addition, it organized the Far East Trading Company, completely controlling South Korea's import and export trade, resulting in an import surplus of 3.8 billion yuan in 1949. American goods flooded the market, and prices rose 1,300 times higher than before liberation, and the issued banknotes exceeded 6 billion yuan (statistics in December 1949), causing American monopoly capital to reap huge profits in South Korea.

Under the cruel economic plunder of the US imperialists, the economy of South Korea under Syngman Rhee's rule has been devastated. Of the approximately 10,000 factories during the Japanese occupation, only 3.4 percent are now operating. Ninety percent of the mines have been shut down. The number of unemployed has reached more than 1.5 million. In the rural population, 3.4 percent of the landlords occupy 63 percent of all the land. Due to the plunder by the US imperialists and the oppression by the Syngman Rhee traitorous group, the cultivated area has been reduced to 60 percent of that before liberation. Over the years, the Syngman Rhee traitorous "government" has forcibly collected 20 million seok of grain from small-holding peasants. This year, it plans to plunder 1.4 million seok of rice from the peasants to transport to Japan. The broad masses of the people are groaning under tyranny.

In order to safeguard their interests, the United States and the South Korean reactionaries have repeatedly attacked the people's democratic rights. The Syngman Rhee traitorous government has implemented an unprecedented police system. Only pro-Japanese elements and traitors such as the Great Korean National Party and the Korean Democratic Party have freedom. In South Korea, all parties and individuals who support the proposal for peaceful national unification will be suppressed, arrested, and massacred. By July last year, 478,000 patriots had been arrested in South Korea. Within four years, 150,000 innocent people were massacred. Kim Gu, the leader of the right-wing party, was assassinated by Syngman Rhee last year because he supported peaceful unification at the joint conference of North-South political parties and organizations. Another right-wing leader, Kim Kyu-sik, was also ostracized and isolated for the same reason. After the armed uprising on Jeju Island, Syngman Rhee massacred more than 30,000 people on the island within three months and burned down three-quarters of the villages on the island. Currently, 133 patriotic political parties and organizations have been disbanded. Ten universities have been closed, and 80 percent of progressive professors and 60 percent of progressive students have been expelled. During the pseudo-election of the "National Assembly" held in South Korea on May 30, voters would be shot if they walked beyond the distance from their residence to the polling station. According to greatly reduced statistics published by southern reactionary newspapers, from November 1949 to January of this year, in a period of two months, more than 150,000 families were burned down. White terror hangs over South Korea.

The armed uprising on Jeju Island in 1948 began a new era in the struggle of the South Korean people. With the support of peasants in various places, the People's Guerrilla Army developed rapidly in the war with the Syngman Rhee army. Now, the activities of the People's Guerrilla Army have expanded to eight provinces, seven cities, 118 counties, and 682 districts. In the three months of February, March, and April of this year alone, the guerrillas fought 4,930 battles with the puppet army, mobilizing 154,159 troops. The number of battles fought by the People's Guerrilla Army is increasing sharply every month, from 545 times in February this year to 2,423 times in April. In the entire month of April this year, the People's Armed Forces annihilated more than 2,000 Syngman Rhee reactionary troops and evil tyrants. Syngman Rhee was forced to admit in October last year: "It is not enough to rely solely on the strength of the army and police to clear the guerrillas from the country." Syngman Rhee's puppet army constantly revolted, often surrendering to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in entire regiments and battalions. The navy and air force also occasionally sailed to the north. The decline in the morale of the puppet army is evident.

The working class of South Korea participated in the struggle against the US-Korean reactionaries with unparalleled heroism. In October 1946, the general strike of 40,000 workers in South Korea was subjected to armed suppression by the Syngman Rhee puppet army, but the broad masses of people, led by the workers, including peasants and students, rose up and launched a struggle. After one and a half months, there were 2.3 million participants in 73 counties in the south, although a total of 22,020 people were arrested, killed, and injured. Since then, the people's struggles, led by workers' strikes, have all had obvious political nature of opposing the US imperialists and the reactionary rule of Syngman Rhee. For example, the general strike in March 1947 protested the large-scale arrest and massacre of patriots, and 90 percent of all workers in the south participated unanimously. From November 1946 to October of the following year, the number of workers' strikes reached 2,388.

In marked contrast to the reactionary rule of the Syngman Rhee gang, the universal, equal, and free general election of the Korean people in 1948 established the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, a series of democratic reforms were implemented. In North Korea, the achievements of the people's democratic regime in economic and construction aspects in the past two years are amazing, and the people's lives have been significantly improved. Recently, in view of the fact that the Two-Year People's Economic Plan for 1949-1950 is about to be completed ahead of schedule, the Council of Ministers of the Republic has decided to formulate the Three-Year People's Economic Plan for 1951-1953. In the industrial field, as early as January 1948, 822 factories and 16 coal mines and mines that were flooded were restored. Due to the rapid recovery and development of industry, more than 70 important industrial products such as electric motors and transformers, which could not be produced during the Japanese rule, could be produced in large quantities in 1947. In 1948, more than 100 new industrial products such as electric motors and various electrical accessories were produced, and mechanical production increased by 246.9 percent, and light industry increased by 152.7 percent, far exceeding the highest production level boasted by Japan in 1944. The laborers have also shown a high degree of enthusiasm. For example, the workers of Musan Mine increased production by 144.4 percent in 1949 compared with 1948, and completed the total annual production volume ahead of schedule in early September. The youth working in the "Democratic Youth Mine" and "Democratic Youth Martin Furnace" completed 200 to 400 percent of the annual production plan.

The average wage of workers in various enterprises under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry increased by 15.1 percent, and the actual increase in wages was far more than this. For example, the state price of cotton in 1949 was reduced by 13.3 percent compared with 1948. In addition, from January 1, 1949, workers in state-owned enterprises were also provided with labor protection materials, work clothes, and work shoes and other necessities of work free of charge. In 1949, the amount of such necessities supplied reached 225 million yuan at state prices.

In agriculture, the production volume of wheat alone exceeded the national planned output by 1.9 percent at the end of 1949. Although 1949 was a rare drought year, the cultivated area still expanded by 94,900 jeongbo. The output of rice and miscellaneous grains increased by 626,490 tons compared with 1944, and cotton increased by 45,033 tons compared with 1944. The number of livestock increased in 1949 compared with 1948 as follows: draft cattle by 10.8 percent, pigs by 56 percent, and sheep by 34 percent. The enthusiasm of farmers for production is also very high. The lives of farmers have obviously improved. According to statistics, the rural harvest in 1944 was 110,000 bags, with a surplus of 55,000 bags after paying rent, and 5,000 bags were sold. In 1948, there was a surplus of 81,000 bags after paying taxes in kind, and 22,000 bags were sold. The harvest in 1949 reached 150,000 bags. Farmers have the capacity to increase various cultural activities. According to a survey by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry at the end of 1949, the number of rural primary schools increased by seven times compared with 1944, the number of clubs and libraries increased by 48 times, the number of middle school students increased by ten times, and the number of university students increased by six times.

The campaign to eliminate illiteracy in North Korea has achieved great success. At the time of the "August 15" liberation, there were 2.3 million illiterate people in North Korea alone, and it was almost completely eliminated by March last year. Taking Pyongyang as an example, there were more than 29,000 illiterate people in 1945, and only two or thirty people at the end of last year. From the spring of 1948, one-year accelerated adult schools were generally established. At the end of last year, there were 37,341 schools with 1,507,055 graduates and students. In the past year, 359,485 new children entered school. There are now more than 327,000 junior high school students, 15 universities, and 100,100 students. The people's patriotic enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. The People's Economic Development Bonds of the Republic exceeded 300 million yuan after only two days of subscription.

The people of North Korea are rapidly moving towards the road of peaceful construction, while South Korea is still under the bloody rule of the US imperialists and Syngman Rhee. However, the people of South Korea are fully aware of the path they should take, and they will stand up more heroically for their own liberation and the realization of the peaceful unification of the motherland, and cooperate closely with the Korean People's Army to completely defeat the invading Syngman Rhee puppet group.

　　为彻底消灭进犯者而战斗的朝鲜人民
    继去年六月提出和平统一方案之后，朝鲜祖国战线中央委员会于今年六月初再度提出促进和平统一具体方案，主张朝鲜最高人民委员会与南朝鲜伪国会合并选举，实现国家的统一。这一提议，获得全朝鲜各民主党派、各阶层人民的一致拥护。可是李承晚集团竟发动同族相残的内战来回答这个正义的、符合朝鲜全体人民愿望的提议。李承晚集团挑动内战的目的，是夺取北部人民的伟大成就，和剥夺其自由，把人民已经获得的土地交还地主；把全朝鲜变成美帝国主义的殖民地。
    在苏军撤退半年后，去年六月美军虽然也宣告撤离了南朝鲜，但庞大的美国军事顾问团仍直接控制着李承晚集团训练、装备和指挥李承晚反动军队进攻人民游击队，并经常侵犯三八线。仅一九四九年一月至一九五○年四月，李承晚匪军的所谓“北伐”挑衅行动即达一千二百七十四次之多。
    美帝国主义指挥并参与四十二次舰队和七十一次飞机袭击北朝鲜人民。最近美帝又以战斗机一批售予李承晚傀儡政府，并在济州、光州、众山、大邱、水原等修筑了五个机场。汉城附近的金浦机场，是南朝鲜最大的机场，已由美帝以四万美元经费予以补修。在黑山岛，美帝除建立军事基地外，并设置无线电台指挥各地间谍特务活动。早在一九四八年，李承晚就与霍奇签订了“韩美暂定的军事协定”，规定了美国对李承晚匪军的统辖权与统帅权。今年二月十七日的“韩国通讯”报道：“美国驻韩军事顾问团长鲁特准将，率领某中队于十六日出动战斗，亲自指挥作战。”连反动报纸也不能隐瞒美军直接参战的事实。本月十六日，美国战争贩子杜勒斯“访问”南朝鲜，在伪“国会”中发表演说，公然怂恿李承晚阻挠和平统一，制造内战。
    在美帝国主义的“援助”下，南朝鲜经济已走向完全破产。现在美帝已占据了南韩经济总资本的百分之九十一点二三，总投资的百分之九十四。所谓“韩美协定”，“韩美经济援助协定”，“韩美火油协定”几个卖国协定实施的结果，南朝鲜经济正急剧衰落。到去年为止，美国向南朝鲜投资已达十亿美元，设立了火油、海运、煤矿等各种垄断组织，独占了南朝鲜全部产业。此外并组织远东贸易公司，完全控制了南朝鲜的出入口贸易，使一九四九年入超达三十八亿元。美国商品汛滥市场，物价较解放前高涨了一千三百倍，发行的纸币突破六百万万元（一九四九年十二月统计）致美国独占资本在南朝鲜获致巨额利益。
    在美帝残酷的经济掠夺下，李承晚统治的南朝鲜的经济残破不堪了。日本占领时期原有一万家左右工厂，现在开工的不过百分之三点四。百分之九十的矿山停工了。失业者已达一百五十万以上。农村人口中百分之三点四的地主占有全部土地的百分之六十三。由于美帝的掠夺和李承晚卖国集团的压榨，耕地面积减低到解放前的百分之六十。李承晚卖国“政府”几年来强制征收了少地农民的二千万石粮谷。今年又拟掠夺农民大米一百四十万石输往日本。广大的人民呻吟在暴政下。
    美国和南朝鲜反动派为了维护他们的利益，一再向人民的民主权利进攻。李承晚卖国政府实施了史无前例的警察制度。只有亲日派和卖国奴如大韩国民党韩民党等才有自由。在南朝鲜，凡是赞成全国和平统一建议的所有党派和个人，都将被弹压，逮捕和屠杀。到去年七月为止，南朝鲜已有四十七万八千爱国者被捕。四年内十五万无辜人民被惨杀。右派党领袖金九因为在南北政党团体联合会议，赞成和平统一，去年为李承晚暗杀。另一右翼领袖金奎植，也因同样理由被排斥而孤立。济州岛武装起义后，李承晚在三个月之内就在该岛惨杀了三万余人民，烧毁了该岛四分之三的村庄。目前被解散的爱国政党和团体已达一百三十三个。十个大学已被封闭，百分之八十的进步教授和百分之六十的进步学生都被逐出。五月三十号南朝鲜举行“国会”伪选时，选民如走出超过住宅至投票处的距离时，就要被射杀。据南部反动报纸所发表的大大缩小的统计，自一九四九年十一月至今年的一月，两个月时间里，被烧毁的人家在十五万以上。白色恐怖笼罩着南朝鲜。
    一九四八年济州岛的武装起义开始了南朝鲜人民斗争的新纪元。人民游击队在与李承晚军队的战争中在各地农民的支援下迅速地发展起来。现在人民游击队的活动已扩展到八道、七市、一百一十八县、六百八十二区。仅今年二、三、四三个月内，游击队与伪军即作战达四千九百三十次，动员兵力十五万四千一百五十九名。人民游击队作战次数是每月都在急剧增加的，今年二月为五百四十五次，但至四月已激增至二千四百二十三次。今年四月份全月内，人民武装歼灭了李承晚反动军队和恶霸特务二千余人。李承晚在去年十月就被迫承认：“要从国内扫清游击队，仅靠军队和警察的力量是不够的。”李承晚伪军不断起义，常常是整团整营的投向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。海空军也时有驶向北部的。伪军士气的衰落可见一斑。
    南朝鲜的工人阶级以无比的英勇参加了反对美韩反动派的斗争。一九四六年十月南朝鲜四万工人的总罢工，曾遭到李承晚伪军的武装镇压，但以工人为首包括农民、学生的广大人民奋起展开了斗争，经过一个半月，在南部七十三个郡里参加者有二百三十万人，虽然此次被逮捕、被杀伤者共达二万二千零二十名。此后每次以工人罢工为首的人民斗争都带有明显的反对美帝及李承晚反动统治的政治性质。例如一九四七年三月曾抗议大规模逮捕和杀戮爱国人士的大罢工，南部全部工人的百分之九十都一致参加。从一九四六年十一月到翌年十月一年中，工人罢工次数达二千三百八十八次。
    和李承晚匪帮的反动统治成一显明对比，一九四八年朝鲜人民的普遍、平等与自由的总选举，成立了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。在朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军领导下实行了一连串的民主改革。在朝鲜北部，两年来人民民主政权经济和建设方面的成就是惊人的，人民生活已有显著提高。最近共和国部长会议鉴于一九四九——一九五○年的二年人民经济计划行将提前完成，已决定制订一九五一——一九五三年的三年人民经济计划。在工业方面，远在一九四八年一月就恢复了八二二所工厂与被水淹浸的一六所煤矿与矿山。由于工业的迅速恢复和发展，在日本统治时代不能生产的电动机和变压器等七十余种重要工业制品在一九四七年就能大量生产了。四八年又生产了电动机及各种电气附属品等一百余种新工业制品，机械生产提高了百分之二百四十六点九，轻工业提高了百分之一五二点七，远驾乎一九四四年的日本自诩为最高的生产水平。劳动者也发挥了高度积极性，如茂山矿工工人在一九四九年较一九四八年增产百分之一百四十四点四，在九月初就提前完成了一年的总生产量。在“民主青年矿坑”、在“民主青年马丁式熔矿炉等”工作的青年生产完成了年产计划百分之二百乃至百分之四百。
    在产业省管辖下的各企业工人工资平均增加了百分之十五点一，而实际工资的增长则远不止此。如棉花国定价格在四九年较四八年减低百分之十三点三，此外，从四九年一月一日起，对国营企业工人还无代价供给劳动保护物资及作业服、劳动鞋等作业必需品，四九年这类必需品供给额，按国定价格已达二亿二千五百万元。
    农业方面，单是麦类生产量在一九四九年底就超过国家计划产量百分之一点九，一九四九年虽然是少有的旱年，但耕地面积仍扩张了九万四千九百町步。米谷杂粮反而比一九四四年增产了六十二万六千四百九十吨，棉花则比一九四四年增产四万五千三十三吨。家畜数一九四九年较一九四八年增加情形如下：耕牛百分之十点八，猪百分之五十六，绵羊百分之三十四。农民生产的积极性也非常高涨。农民生活显然改善了，据统计：四四年农村收获量是十一万包，除交租外余五万五千包，出售五千包，而一九四八年除交纳现物税外余八万一千包，出售了二万二千包，一九四九年的收获量则达到十五万包。农民有余力增加各项文化活动。据农林省一九四九年年底调查：农村初等学校较一九四四年增加七倍，俱乐部与图书馆增加了四十八倍，中学生增加了十倍，大学生增加了六倍。
    北部扫除文盲的运动获得极大胜利，在“八、一五”解放时，仅北朝鲜就有文盲二百三十万人，到去年三月就几乎全扫除了，以平壤为例，一九四五年有文盲二万九千余人，去年底只有二三十人了。从一九四八年春就普遍设立了为期一年的成人速成学校，去年底已有三七三四一所，毕业和在学学生一百五十万七千零五十五名。去年一年内新入学儿童达三十五万九千四百八十五人。现初中学生三十二万七千余人，大学十五所，学生十万零一千余人。人民的爱国热情空前高涨，共和国人民经济发展债券仅仅经过两天的认购，就超过了三亿余元。
    北朝鲜人民迅速走向和平建设的大道，而南朝鲜仍在美帝及李承晚的血腥统治下。但是，南朝鲜人民完全认清自己应走的道路，他们将会为自己的解放和实现祖国的和平统一而更加英勇地站起来，和朝鲜人民的军队密切配合，彻底打垮进犯者李承晚傀儡集团。
