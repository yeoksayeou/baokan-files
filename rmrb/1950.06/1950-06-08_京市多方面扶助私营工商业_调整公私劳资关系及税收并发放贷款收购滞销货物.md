[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government is actively working to help private industry and commerce overcome temporary difficulties, focusing on adjusting public-private relations, labor-management relations, adjusting taxation, issuing loans, and purchasing slow-moving goods.

Regarding the adjustment of public-private relations, the Municipal Bureau of Commerce convened a meeting of the Beijing branches of state-owned specialized companies in mid-May, and made in-depth reviews of aspects that affected public-private relations in terms of supporting production and business operations. Regarding the adjustment of labor-management relations, the Labor Bureau called for the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings. Labor-management consultation meetings have now been established in the following eight industries: mechanized flour, oil, salt, grain, pottery, hardware, Chinese medicine, new medicines, bathhouses, and barber shops, as well as more than ten factories and shops such as Housheng Match Factory. Industries that are currently under consideration and will soon be established include: weaving and dyeing, and machine-made paper. In factories and shops where labor-management consultation meetings have been established, both labor and management have generally improved their understanding of the "both labor and capital benefit" policy. Workers have increased production efficiency and product quality, and are willing to reduce wages when necessary; capitalists have also increased their enthusiasm for management, increased their confidence in overcoming difficulties, and improved their management methods. As a result, business is gradually improving. For example, Jingwei Weaving Factory and Ruifuxiang Silk and Cloth Store have both turned from losses to profits. In terms of adjusting industrial and commercial taxes, the Taxation Bureau, in addition to adjusting the unbalanced burdens of individual industries for overdue industrial and commercial taxes in the second half of 1949, also appropriately reduced, exempted, or deferred taxes for industrial and commercial households with poor business, unfair assessments, and temporary capital turnover difficulties. As of May 25, the city had already reduced, exempted, or deferred taxes totaling 2.85 billion yuan. Among them, 957 households had their taxes reduced, 317 households were exempted from taxes, and 1,281 households had their tax payments deferred. Regarding the issuance of loans, in April and May, the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China, in addition to issuing loans of 8.2 billion yuan to private enterprises, also led private banks and money shops to organize joint syndicates to support private industry and commerce. Since its establishment on May 20, the syndicate has issued loans of over 410 million yuan by May 26. In addition, the Bureau of Commerce and various specialized companies have also purchased slow-moving goods.

In order to specifically assist private industrial and commercial households in overcoming current difficulties, the Municipal People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee has also invited financial and economic departments throughout the city, as well as industrial and commercial trade associations and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, to form a temporary working group. At the same time, it is also actively preparing for the establishment of a joint public-private Xingye Co., Ltd., on the one hand, to concentrate idle funds and invest them in production; on the other hand, to provide a smooth path for the development of private industry through joint public-private investment.

　　京市多方面扶助私营工商业
    调整公私劳资关系及税收并发放贷款收购滞销货物
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府为了协助私营工商业度过暂时困难，正积极从调整公私关系、劳资关系、调整税收、发放贷款、收购滞销货物等多方面着手。
    在调整公私关系上，市商业局在五月中旬召集国营各专业公司北京分公司开会，对于在扶植生产和业务经营方面，有影响公私关系的，都做了深刻检讨。在调整劳资关系上，劳动局号召成立劳资协商会议。现已成立劳资协商会议的有：机制面粉、油盐粮、盆窑、五金、国药、新药、浴堂、理发等八行业，及厚生火柴厂等十余家工厂和商店。正在酝酿即将成立的有：织染、机器造纸等行业。凡已成立了劳资协商会议的工厂、商店，劳资双方一般都提高了对“劳资两利”政策的认识，工人提高生产效率和产品质量，必要时并自愿降低工资；资方也提高经营的积极性，增加克服困难的信心，改善经营方法。这样，使营业渐呈好转。如经纬织布厂，瑞蚨祥绸布店等，都由赔累走向盈余。在调整工商业税收方面，税务局对一九四九年下半年工商业税的滞纳户，除调整个别行业不平衡的负担外，并对营业不好，评议不公，资金暂时周转不灵的工商户，酌予减税、免税或缓缴。截至五月二十五日止，全市已经及决定减、免、缓缴税款者，共合税款二十八亿五千余万元。其中减税者九百五十七户，免税者三百十七户，缓期缴纳者一千二百八十一户。在发放贷款方面，中国人民银行北京分行四、五两月除贷款给私营企业八十二亿元外，并领导私营银行钱庄，组织联合银团，扶助私营工商业。该团自五月二十日成立，至五月二十六日，已放出贷款四亿一千余万元。此外，商业局及各专业公司，并收购滞销货物。
    为了具体协助私营工商业户克服目前困难，市人民政府财经委员会，更邀集全市财经部门及工商业同业公会、市总工会等，成立临时工作小组。同时，又积极筹备公私合营的兴业股份有限公司，一方面集中闲散游资，投入生产；一方面公私合资，给私营工业铺平发展的道路。
