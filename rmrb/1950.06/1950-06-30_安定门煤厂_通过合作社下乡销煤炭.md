　　Andingmen Coal Factory
    Sells Coal to Rural Areas Through Cooperatives
    [Report from this newspaper] The Andingmen Coal Factory, a branch of the Beijing Coal Industry and Building Materials Company, has been assisting rural cooperatives in organizing the sale of coal to rural areas, opening up sales channels. Since vigorously developing its business in March, the factory has established regular trading relationships with ten village cooperatives, including Qinghe Town, Xibahe, and Huizhong'an in the northern suburbs of Beijing. In April, it sold a total of 100 tons of coal, which increased to over 180 tons in May, and reached over 130 tons in the first half of June. When they initially went into the rural areas, cooperative workers lacked confidence in operating coal due to limited funds, lack of experience, and unsuitable locations. After repeated mobilization and various preferential treatments and considerations, such as delivering goods on time upon phone or written request, and delivering whatever type of coal was needed, with additional rewards for ordering whole truckloads, they saw tangible benefits and increased their confidence in operation. For example, the Qinghe Town cooperative used three tons of coal to make briquettes for trial sales. Villagers found them to be of high quality and reasonably priced, and therefore purchased them in large numbers. The Xibahe Village Cooperative not only supplied fuel for its own village, but also sold it to villagers in nearby villages. All village cooperatives that started operating coal have seen their business improve, generally selling more than one or two tons per day, greatly enhancing the prestige of the cooperatives among the masses.

　　安定门煤厂
    通过合作社下乡销煤炭
    【本报讯】北京煤业建筑器材分公司安定门煤厂扶助农村合作社，组织煤炭下乡，打开了销路。该厂自三月份大力开展业务以来，至目前已与京市北郊清河镇、西坝河、慧忠庵等十个村合作社建立了经常的交易关系，四月份共销煤一百吨，五月份增至一八○余吨，六月份上半月则已达一三○余吨。当开始深入农村时，合作社工作人员因资金少，缺乏经验，地址不适当，对经营煤炭缺乏信心。后经反复动员，及各方面的优待、照顾，如电话或写信要货，按时送到，要什么样的送什么样的；整车要货另有奖励等。他们看到实际的利益，提高了经营信心。如清河镇合作社用三吨煤制成煤球试销，村民看到质高价廉，遂纷纷购用。西坝河村社不但供给本村所需燃料，还要销给附近村的村民。凡开始经营煤炭的村社，营业越来越好，一般每天都能销一、二吨以上，大大提高了合作社在群众中的威信。
