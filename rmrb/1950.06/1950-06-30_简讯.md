    The Shandong Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China held a conference of its branch directors from June 5th to 10th. The meeting focused on discussing the staffing, division of powers, and future work guidelines and principles of banks at all levels in the province.

At the same time, it was decided to launch industrial loans in Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, and other places, striving to achieve the goal of reforming the management methods of private enterprises through loans. Cash management work requires the implementation of income and expenditure plans down to the county level before July.

    Fenyang People's Bank Decides to Issue Industrial and Commercial Loans
    The Fenyang Special District Office of the People's Bank of China focused on absorbing deposits in May, so the amount of public deposits increased by 40% compared to April, and private deposits increased threefold compared to April. However, it neglected to support private industry and commerce with loans, resulting in loans of only 110 million yuan in May, a decrease of twofold compared to April. In order to help private enterprises solve their working capital difficulties and support the export of local products such as wool, it has been decided to issue industrial and commercial loans of 400 million yuan in June and July.

The ratio of cash receipts and payments to transfer receipts and payments in the entire Chahar South area is 1:3.5.

    Security Work at Qiqihar Public Jianhua Factory Urgently Needs Improvement
    The Qiqihar Municipal Labor Bureau, Industry Bureau, Health Department, and Trade Union jointly formed a security inspection team and carefully inspected the security work of the city's public Jianhua Factory. Most of the factory's machines do not have safety equipment, and some machines are not installed properly, so accidents are prone to occur. The lighting in the workshops is generally insufficient, and there is no ventilation equipment. In particular, the dust in the hemp combing and hemp dusting rooms is like fog, seriously harming the workers' breathing and eyes. There are no spittoons in the workshop, and there are only three drinking buckets in the entire factory, not even a bowl for drinking water, so most workers drink cold water. Workers on day and night shifts live in the same dormitory, which affects each other's sleep. According to statistics, the number of patients in the factory in April accounted for 19.5% of the total number of workers in the factory, and the number of sick leave days in May reached 138 days. After the inspection team put forward more than 50 items that urgently needed to be improved, the factory management committee has discussed and studied them, and is now starting to improve them in a planned way.

    Failure to Comply with Safety Regulations in Factories and Mines Leads to Gas Explosions in Fushun and Xuanhua
    Due to poor ventilation equipment and workers and security personnel failing to comply with safety regulations, gas explosions occurred in the Laohutai Mine of the Fushun Mining Bureau and the Baoxing Coal Mine in Xuanhua City in the first half of this month. A gas explosion occurred in the second pit of the Baoxing Mine on the 3rd due to workers smoking, killing and injuring ten workers. After the incident, the mine's administration and trade union immediately convened a meeting of employee representatives. In addition to reviewing the causes of the accident, it was also decided to strengthen the underground ventilation equipment and strictly implement the "Smoking and Fire Prevention Implementation Measures" underground. A gas explosion occurred in the Laohutai Mine of the Fushun Mining Bureau on the 15th of this month, injuring two workers. The main reason for the accident was that the mine's security officer stopped the fan once a week without following the safety regulations, causing gas to gush out underground. In addition, the workers did not comply with labor discipline and smoked underground without authorization, which caused the explosion. The factory is conducting an accident review.

    齐市公营建华工厂保安工作亟待改善
    齐齐哈尔市劳动局、工业厅、卫生处和总工会等单位联合组成保安检查组，认真检查了该市公营建华工厂的保安工作。该厂绝大部分机器，都没有安全设备，有的机械则安装不妥善，因此容易发生事故；车间光线普遍不足，没有通风装置，特别是梳麻、掸麻等室，尘土若雾，严重的侵害着工人的呼吸和眼睛；车间内没有痰筒设备，全厂只有三个饮水桶，连一个喝水的碗也没有，因此大部分工人都喝凉水；昼夜班的工人住在一个宿舍，互相影响睡眠。据统计：该厂四月份患病人数占全厂工人的百分之十九点五，五月份请病假的达一百三十八天。检查组提出亟需改进的五十余件事项后，该厂管委会已进行讨论研究，现正开始有计划地进行改善。

    不遵守厂矿保安规章  抚顺宣化瓦斯爆炸
    因通风设备不良及工人保安人员不遵守保安规则，抚顺矿务局老虎台矿及宣化市宝兴煤矿，于本月上半月先后发生瓦斯爆炸事件。宝兴矿二坑因工人吸烟于三日发生瓦斯爆炸，死伤工人十名。事件发生后，该矿行政和工会立即召开职工代表大会，除检讨事故发生原因外，并决定加强坑下通风设备，严格执行坑下“禁烟禁火实施办法”。抚顺矿务局老虎台矿于本月十五日发生瓦斯爆炸事件，工人二名受伤。发生事故的主要原因，是该矿保安科员不按保安规程，每周私自停止扇风机一次，以致井下瓦斯涌出，加之工人不遵守劳动纪律，擅自在井下抽烟，因而引起此次爆炸事故。该厂正进行事故检讨。
