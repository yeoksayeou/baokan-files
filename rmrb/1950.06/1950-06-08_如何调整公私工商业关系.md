　　How to Adjust the Relationship Between Public and Private Industry and Commerce

    The conference of directors of industry and commerce bureaus of the seven major cities last month, based on the principle of public-private partnership in the Common Program, focused on discussing the issue of adjusting the relationship between public and private industry and commerce, because this is a major issue in the current process of national economic recovery.
    What was the basic situation between public and private industry and commerce in the past?
    It should be said that state-owned economy has provided assistance to private capitalist economy, cooperative economy, individual economy of farmers and handicraftsmen, and state capitalist economy in the past. State-owned enterprises have conducted a large number of finished product purchases, raw material supplies, consignment and distribution businesses with private enterprises. State-owned enterprises purchased large quantities of agricultural products, by-products, and handicraft products from farmers. State-owned enterprises adopted the method of entrusting purchases and sales to cooperatives and giving them appropriate preferential treatment, which supported the development of people's cooperative undertakings. State-owned enterprises have widely cooperated with private enterprises through forms such as processing, exclusive sales, and joint public-private operation, which encouraged the development of state capitalism.
    But it should also be said that state-owned enterprise agencies have been biased in implementing policies toward private industry and commerce. For example, some state-owned enterprises sometimes stipulated overly harsh processing conditions when entrusting processing to private enterprises. State-owned trading companies sometimes did not adequately consider the legitimate profits of private enterprises when formulating prices. The management of export trade was sometimes excessively strict. The scope of state-owned trade was also not appropriately divided with private commerce, which made private commerce feel threatened. In raw material procurement, legitimate private commerce was also excluded. Some state-owned enterprises refused to participate in trade associations; they also lacked necessary assistance and guidance for the business direction of private enterprises. This has made it so that some private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood have not been able to cooperate with state-owned enterprises in division of labor and each get its due place under the overall consideration of the state-owned economy. What is the reason for this? The most important reason is that some state economic workers lack the idea of long-term division of labor and cooperation with private capitalism. Some even think that "some parts" of the Common Program do not need to be implemented. These comrades only have abstract socialist concepts and lack the unity of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution. They have forgotten the Common Program and Mao Zedong's instructions on this aspect. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Due to the backwardness of China's economy, the capitalist economy represented by the broad petty bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie must be allowed to exist for a long period of time even after the victory of the revolution throughout the country; and according to the division of labor in the national economy, all parts of them that are beneficial to the national economy need to have a development; they are still an indispensable part of the entire national economy." ("The Current Situation and Our Tasks"). Comrade Mao Zedong also said: "The national bourgeoisie has great importance at the present stage. We still have imperialism standing by, and this enemy is very vicious. China needs to go through a long time to realize true economic independence. Only when China's industry develops and China is no longer economically dependent on foreign countries can it have complete and true independence. The proportion of China's modern industry in the entire national economy is very small. There are no reliable figures now. According to some materials, modern industry only accounts for about 10% of the total national economic production. In order to deal with the oppression of imperialism and to improve the backward economic status, China must use all urban and rural capitalist factors that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and not harmful, unite the national bourgeoisie, and fight together." ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"). People who hold utopian socialist ideas precisely do not understand these basic characteristics of China's social economy. Therefore, they violated Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions. Their erroneous ideas are harmful to the Chinese revolution. Of course, state-owned economy should oppose private enterprises that are detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood and the speculative activities of private capitalists, and guide them to turn to industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It should have been like this in the past, it should be like this now, and it should be like this in the future. However, we should earnestly unite with all private industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.
    What should be the basic principle for adjusting the relationship between public and private industry and commerce?
    The basic principle for adjusting the relationship between public and private industry and commerce is Article 26 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which all economic and political workers must read carefully and remember firmly: "The fundamental policy of economic construction of the People's Republic of China is to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy with the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, and exchanging internally and externally. The state should adjust state-owned economy, cooperative economy, individual economy of farmers and handicraftsmen, private capitalist economy, and state capitalist economy in all aspects of the economic scope, raw material supply, sales market, labor conditions, technical equipment, financial policy, and monetary policy, so that each social economic component can cooperate in the division of labor under the leadership of the state-owned economy, each get its due place, so as to promote the development of the entire social economy."
    Article 26 of the Common Program not only generally stipulates the overall policy of national economic construction, but also correctly stipulates the relationship between public and private interests. Our task is to accurately implement the above policy.
    What issues need to be resolved most urgently in the relationship between public and private industry and commerce?
    Here, the issue of the relationship between public and private industry should be resolved first. And in the relationship between public and private industry, we must first resolve the issue of entrusting processing, ordering, and purchasing from private industry.
    The industrial economy currently accounts for roughly only 10% of China's national economy. This is the sum of public and private industries. If we do not adopt the policy of uniting and developing private industry that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, we will weaken the speed of China's industrialization. Therefore, the state should provide private industry with necessary assistance in terms of operating scope, raw material supply, sales market, labor conditions, technical equipment, financial policy, and monetary policy, in accordance with the general policy of economic construction stipulated in the Common Program. It is an important form for state organs and state-owned enterprises to entrust processing, order, and purchase products from private industry. This is the method of helping private capitalism move toward state capitalism as stipulated in Article 31 of the Common Program, which is also the method of gradually overcoming the blindness of private industrial production. If private industry does not carry out production under the unified planning and leadership of the state, but adopts the anarchic and blind production method of capitalist countries, it will not only be detrimental to China's industrialization, but also detrimental to private industry itself. Especially at present, due to the stabilization of currency and the elimination of false purchasing power, various commodities are generally overstocked. This method of ordering, entrusting processing, and purchasing products is extremely important for helping private industry sell finished products, activate capital, and maintain production to overcome the current difficulties.
    According to what principles should state-owned enterprises carry out the work of ordering and purchasing products from private industry?
    First, it should be based on the needs and possibilities of the country. The so-called need means that the goods entrusted for processing, ordered, and purchased should be useful to the country now or in the future. For example, cotton yarn and cotton cloth can be used to supply clothing for military and government personnel and stabilize prices; paper can be used to supply the needs of the publishing industry; steel products can be used to supply the needs of industry and national defense. The so-called possibility means that the quantity ordered and purchased should be limited to the possibility of the country's existing economic strength. If it is carried out reluctantly beyond this limit, it will inevitably cause inflation and damage price stability. This is not only detrimental to the majority of the people, but also detrimental to private enterprises themselves.
    Second, the regional distribution of orders and purchases should be appropriate, that is, it must be based on the different situations of various enterprises in various regions and given appropriate assistance from the perspective of the overall situation. The determination of processing types and processing regions should be统筹 (Tǒngchóu; under overall consideration) by the central government. Appropriate distribution within a region should be managed by the local administrative departments of industry and commerce in conjunction with industrial and commercial groups and workers' groups. During the distribution, on the one hand, we must strive for fairness and reasonableness, taking into account both public and private interests. On the other hand, we must make relevant employees understand the significance of ordering and purchasing, so as to ensure the timely completion of production plans.
    Third, the purchase price should be based on the market price and should not be lower or higher than the market price. The "processing fee" should be based on the average standard of reasonable operation in the processing area to calculate the factory cost. For orders where the market price is lower than the cost and the state loses money, the capital side should adhere to the principle of guaranteeing capital; for normal orders where the market price is higher than the cost and the state benefits, the capital side should obtain reasonable profits in addition to the cost. The determination of the processing fee should be jointly agreed upon by the ordering agency and the capital and labor sides undertaking the processing, convened by the local administrative department of industry and commerce.
    Fourth, processing conditions should be treated equally for both public and private factories, and there should be no bias.
    Fifth, both public and private parties should strictly abide by the ordering and purchasing contracts. In the past, some public enterprises did not comply with the contract provisions, refused to accept goods, or delayed the payment of processing fees; some private enterprises also had phenomena of delivering less goods, delivering late, delivering bad goods, and even not delivering goods. This behavior of breaking the contract hinders mutual trust and division of labor and cooperation between public and private enterprises and must be effectively improved.
    The above five points are the main principles of ordering and purchasing. The ordering and purchasing relationship between public and private enterprises in various places should be inspected according to the above principles. If there are any unsuitable parts, they can be re-signed with the consent of both parties.
    In the relationship between public and private industry and commerce, the second major problem that urgently needs to be solved is the problem of the relationship between public and private commerce.
    Private commerce will still be indispensable for a considerable period of time in the future. Because China is a large country, and in the national economy, the small-scale production of scattered farmers and handicraftsmen accounts for a very large proportion. Therefore, purchasing rural by-products and organizing urban-rural exchanges is an extremely huge task. State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, both at present and for a long time to come, do not have the possibility of fully undertaking this exchange responsibility in terms of manpower and financial resources. Because the proportion of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in the national commercial economy is currently smaller than that of private commerce, it will take a considerable amount of time to organize the exchange behavior of the vast and scattered individual economies of farmers and handicraftsmen on a large scale, form a cooperative commercial system under the leadership of state-owned commerce, and form a commercial system of a socialist nature. In order to make these agricultural and sideline products, which are scattered geographically and large in quantity, enter the cities as much as possible; At the same time, in order to enable urban industrial products to flow into the vast rural areas as much as possible, in addition to state-owned trade agencies and cooperatives assuming important responsibilities, private commerce also has great importance.
    Of course, private commerce should also carry out work that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood under the leadership of state-owned commerce, not the other way around. The feudal and speculative commerce of old China, relying on monopoly and speculation methods, seriously exploited small producers and consumers, and obtained excessive commercial profits, which was unanimously opposed by the vast majority of small producers and consumers. This excess profit must be reduced to a legitimate profit. Article 37 of the Common Program stipulates: "State-owned trade agencies should be responsible for regulating supply and demand, stabilizing prices, and supporting people's cooperative undertakings." In order to regulate supply and demand and stabilize prices so that they are not too high or too low, state-owned trade agencies must maintain appropriate purchase prices and sales prices of agricultural products in urban-rural exchanges, so as to protect the interests of both farmers, handicraftsmen and consumers. Facts have proved that this serious responsibility of "manipulating the people's livelihood" must be placed on the state-owned commerce of the people's government that serves the people, and not on private commerce. However, if private commerce does not occupy the position of manipulating the people's livelihood but occupies the position of obeying the leadership of state-owned commerce, then it can still play a certain role at present and for a considerable period of time in the future.
    The main problems in the current relationship between public and private commerce are the price policy in the purchase aspect and the state-owned retail commerce issue in the sales aspect.
    The price policy of state-owned commerce is the basic link in the relationship between public and private commerce. In our country, a correct price policy should take into account the three aspects of producers, transporters, and consumers, that is, it must be beneficial to all three aspects and cannot be neglected. Only in this way can production continue, commodities find sales channels, and materials can be exchanged. This is the basis for our country's trade agencies to determine prices. After the stabilization of national prices in March this year, an abnormal price state appeared in the commercial market. It is manifested in: the prices of urban industrial products are higher than those in rural areas, the cost of factories is higher than the market price, the wholesale price of some commodities is higher than the retail price, and the listed price of state-owned trade agencies is higher than the market price. This is mainly due to the disappearance of false purchasing power after currency stabilization, the influx of previously hoarded commodities into the market, and the fact that ordinary consumers have a certain amount of material reserves, which temporarily reduces the amount of purchases. The failure of the national financial authorities to foresee the market trend after price stabilization and to take timely steps to alleviate this unreasonable price state is also a factor in the formation of this abnormal state. This abnormal price must be changed, and it is already being changed. State trade agencies have now begun to adjust prices and implement a policy that takes into account all three parties. In the process of price adjustment, on the one hand, we should prevent private commerce from feudal exploitation of small producers and consumers; on the other hand, we should oppose the bias of some local workers who unilaterally emphasize protecting the interests of farmers and blindly raise the prices of agricultural products. The result of stipulating excessively high prices for agricultural products will make it impossible for consumers to purchase them, and private merchants will not be willing to go to the countryside because there is no profit to be made. In this case, even if state-owned trade agencies and cooperatives transport and sell at a loss, it will inevitably be unsustainable. This situation will inevitably block urban-rural exchanges, which is not only detrimental to state-owned commerce, cooperative commerce, and private commerce, but also fundamentally detrimental to urban industry and the working class on the one hand, and extremely detrimental to farmers themselves due to product overstocking on the other hand.
    The important issue in the sales aspect of public and private commerce is the state-owned retail commerce issue.
    In the past six months, in order to stabilize urban retail prices, state-owned trade agencies have set up a certain number of retail stores, which has played a huge role in stabilizing retail prices, first of all, stabilizing the retail prices of people's daily necessities, and protecting the lives of the vast urban people, and has been warmly supported by the vast people. If state-owned trade agencies only carry out wholesale trade and do not carry out retail trade, they will not be able to fulfill the task of "stabilizing prices" stipulated in Article 37 of the Common Program. However, the operation of state-owned retail stores should aim at stabilizing urban retail market prices and preventing speculative merchants from arbitrarily raising retail prices; it should not attempt to replace all private commerce. Therefore, state-owned retail commerce should appropriately limit its operating scope and maintain an appropriate difference between retail prices and wholesale prices, so that legitimate retailers can make profits under the price policy of state-owned trade agencies. State-owned trade agencies mainly rely on the wholesale market to supply materials and withdraw currency, and should not rely on the retail market. The commodities sold in large quantities by state-owned retail stores should be limited to six kinds of people's daily necessities: grain, salt, coal, cooking oil, cloth, and kerosene. As for retail department stores, there should be more restrictions. The number of all kinds of retail stores should be limited to stabilizing local commodity retail prices. Only in this way can state-owned commerce guarantee the stability of prices and reserve a wide range of activities for law-abiding private retail commerce.
    The relationship between public and private industry and commerce is the foundation of the policy of taking into account both public and private interests. If these two aspects of the relationship are adjusted well, the policy of taking into account both public and private interests will be basically realized.

　　如何调整公私工商业关系
    上月七大城市工商局长会议，曾根据共同纲领公私兼顾的原则，着重地讨论了调整公私工商业关系问题，因为这是目前国民经济恢复过程中的一个大问题。
    过去在公私工商业间的基本情况是怎样呢？
    应当说，国营经济在过去对于私人资本主义经济、合作社经济、农民和手工业者的个体经济及国家资本主义经济是给了帮助的。国营企业对私人企业进行了大批的成品收购、原料供给、代销与经销等业务。国营企业大量收购了农民的农产品、副产品和手工业生产品。国营企业对合作社采取了委托代购、代销并给以适当优待的办法，扶助了人民合作事业的发展。国营企业曾通过加工、包销、公私合营等形式广泛地与私人企业合作，鼓励了国家资本主义的发展。
    但是同样应当说，国营企业机关在执行对私人工商业的政策时是有偏向的。例如：有些国营企业在委托私人企业加工时，其所规定的加工条件有时过于苛刻。国营贸易公司在制订价格时，有时对私人企业的合法利润照顾不足。对于出口贸易的管理，有时失之过严。国营贸易的范围，也未与私人商业适当划分，使私人商业感到威胁。在原料收购中，正当的私人商业也有被排斥的现象。有些国营企业不肯参加同业公会；对于私人企业的经营方向，也缺乏必要的帮助与指导。这就使得有些有利于国计民生的私人企业，还未能在国营经济统筹兼顾下，与国营企业分工合作，各得其所。这是什么原因呢？其中最主要的原因，是部分的国家经济工作人员中缺乏与私人资本主义长期分工合作的思想。甚至于有人以为共同纲领的“有些部分”是不必实行的。这些同志只有抽象的社会主义观念，而缺乏马列主义与中国革命实践之统一的思想。他们忘记了共同纲领，忘记了毛泽东同志关于这一方面的指示。毛泽东同志说：“由于中国经济的落后性，广大的小资产阶级与中等资产阶级所代表的资本主义经济，即使革命在全国胜利以后，在一个长时期内，还是必须允许他们存在；并且按国民经济的分工，还需要他们中一切有益于国民经济的部分有一个发展；他们在整个国民经济中，还是不可缺少的部分。”（《目前形势和我们的任务》）。毛泽东同志又说：“民族资产阶级在现阶段上，有其很大的重要性。我们还有帝国主义站在旁边，这个敌人是很凶恶的。中国要实现经济上的真正独立，还需要经过很长时间。只有中国工业发展了，中国在经济上不倚赖外国了，才有全部的真正的独立。中国的现代工业，在整个国民经济上的比重是很小的。现在还没有可靠数字，根据某些材料来估计，现代工业不过只占全国国民经济总生产量的百分之十左右。为了对付帝国主义的压迫，为了使落后的经济地位提高一步，中国必须利用一切于国计民生有利而不是有害的城乡资本主义因素，团结民族资产阶级，共同奋斗。”（《论人民民主专政》）。抱着空想的社会主义观念的人们，恰恰是不了解中国社会经济的这些基本特点，因而，他们就违背了毛泽东同志的指示。他们的错误思想，对于中国革命是有害的。当然，对于不利于国计民生的私人企业，对于私人资本家的投机倒把行为，国营经济是应当加以反对的，并引导它们转为有利于国计民生的工商业。过去应当如此，现在应当如此，将来也应当如此。但是，对于一切有利于国计民生的私人工商业就应当认真地团结他们。
    调整公私工商业关系的基本原则应当是什么呢？
    调整公私工商业关系的基本原则，就是一切经济工作人员和政治工作人员都必须熟读牢记的中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第二十六条：“中华人民共和国经济建设的根本方针，是以公私兼顾、劳资两利、内外交流的政策，达到发展生产、繁荣经济之目的。国家应在经济范围，原料供给，销售市场，劳动条件，技术设备，财政政策，金融政策等各方面，调剂国营经济、合作社经济、农民和手工业者的个体经济、私人资本主义经济和国家资本主义经济，使每种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济之发展。”
    共同纲领第二十六条不仅一般地规定了国家经济建设的总方针，同时也正确地规定了公私关系。我们的任务，就在于把上述方针准确地加以实行。
    在公私工商业关系中目前最需要解决的是那些问题呢？
    这里首先应当解决公私工业关系问题。而在公私工业关系中，首先要解决对于私营工业的委托加工、订货与收购问题。
    工业经济在目前中国国民经济中的比重，大致只有百分之十。这是公私营工业的总和。对于有益国计民生的私营工业不采取团结与发展的方针，就将减弱中国工业化的速度。因此，国家应按共同纲领所规定的经济建设的总方针，在经营范围、原料供给、销售市场、劳动条件、技术设备、财政政策、金融政策等方面，予私营工业以必要的扶助。国家机关与国营企业对于私营工业实行委托加工、订货和收购产品，是国家扶植私营工业的重要形式。这就是共同纲领第三十一条所规定的帮助私人资本主义走向国家资本主义的方法，也就是逐渐克服私营工业生产盲目性的方法。私营工业如果不在国家的统一计划与领导之下来进行生产，而采取资本主义国家中那种无政府的盲目的生产方法，不但对于中国工业化不利，而且对于私营工业本身也是不利的。特别是在目前，由于通货稳定，虚假购买力消灭而引起的各种商品普遍滞销的情况下，这种订货、委托加工和收购产品的方式，对于帮助私人工业推销成品，活动资本，维持生产，以度过目前难关，更有极重要的作用。
    国营企业应根据什么原则来进行向私营工业订货和收购产品的工作呢？
    第一，应当根据国家的需要与可能。所谓需要，是说所委托加工的、所订的、所收购的货物应当对国家目前或将来有用。例如：棉纱、棉布可以供给军、政人员服装及稳定物价的需要；纸张可以供给出版事业的需要；钢铁产品可以供给工业及国防的需要。所谓可能，就是指所订的、所收购的数量，应当以国家现有经济力量的可能为限。如果超过这种限度勉强进行，势必引起通货膨胀，破坏物价稳定。这就不仅不利于大多数人民，而且也不利于私营企业自身。
    第二，订货和收购的地区分配要适当，即必须根据各个地区各种企业的不同情况，从全局观点给以恰当的帮助。加工种类与加工地区之确定，应由中央统筹。在一个地区内的恰当分配，应由当地工商行政部门会同工商业团体和工人团体主持办理。在分配时，一方面要力求公平合理，公私兼顾，另一方面要使有关职工了解订货和收购的意义，以便保证生产计划按期完成。
    第三，收购价格应根据市价，不应低于或高于市价。加工的“工缴费”应根据加工地区合理经营的中等标准，计算工厂成本。凡市价低于成本，由国家赔本的订货，资方应以保本为原则；凡市价高于成本，国家有利的正常订货，资方应在成本以外取得合理利润。工缴费的确定，应由当地工商行政部门召集订货机关和承制的资方劳方共同协议规定。
    第四，对公私工厂加工条件应当一视同仁，不应有所偏颇。
    第五，公私双方均应严格信守订货和收购合同。过去有些公营企业不遵守合同规定，拒绝收货，或迟付工缴费；有些私人企业也有少交货，晚交货，交坏货，甚至不交货的现象。这种破坏合同的行为，妨碍了公私企业双方互相信任和分工合作，必须切实改进。
    上述五点是订货收购的主要原则。各地公私企业的订货收购关系，应根据以上原则进行检查。其中如有不适合的部分，在双方同意下，可从新改订。
    在公私工商业关系中，急待解决的第二个大问题是公私商业关系问题。
    私营商业，在今后相当长时期内，仍然是不可少的。由于中国是个大国，而在国民经济中，分散的农民和手工业者的小生产，占有极大的比重。因此收购农村副产品与组织城乡交流，是一件极为巨大的工作。国营商业和合作社商业在目前以及今后一个很长时期内，在人力上、财力上都还没有可能把这个交换责任完全担负起来。因为国营商业和合作社商业目前在全国商业经济中所占的比重，还小于私人商业，所以要把广大的分散的农民和手工业者的个体经济的交换行为大量地组织起来，成为合作社商业，在国营商业的领导下，形成社会主义性质的商业体系，还需要相当长的时间。为了使这些在地区上分散的，在数量上庞大的农副产品，尽可能地进入城市；同时使城市工业品尽可能地流入广大农村，除了国营贸易机关和合作社应担任重要责任外，私人商业还有很大的重要性。
    当然，私人商业也应当在国营商业领导之下来进行有益于国计民生的工作，而不是相反。旧中国的封建性和投机性的商业，依靠垄断和投机的方法，严重地剥削小生产者和消费者，获得超额的商业利润，这是广大的小生产者和消费者所一致反对的。这种超额利润必须降低到正当利润。共同纲领第三十七条规定：“国营贸易机关应负调剂供求，稳定物价和扶助人民合作事业的责任。”为了调剂供求，稳定物价不使过高或过低，国营贸易机关在城乡交流方面，就必须维持农产品的适当收购价格和出售价格，以保障农民、手工业者和消费人民双方的利益。事实证明，这个“操纵国民生计”的严重责任，必须放在为人民服务的人民政府的国营商业身上，而不能放在私营商业身上。但是私营商业如果不居于操纵国民生计的地位而居于服从国营商业领导的地位，那么，它在目前和今后一个相当长的时期内，就还可以发挥它的一定的作用了。
    目前公私商业关系中的主要问题，是收购方面的价格政策问题和销售方面的国营零售商业问题。
    国营商业的价格政策，是公私商业关系的基本环节。在我们的国家中，正确的价格政策，应当照顾到生产者、贩运者和消费者三个方面，即是对三个方面都要有利，不可偏废。只有这样，才能使生产继续进行、商品找到销路、物资能够交流。这是我们国家贸易机关决定价格的根据。今年三月全国物价平稳以后，在商业市场上出现了畸形的价格状态。它表现在：城市工业品价格高于乡村、工厂成本高于市价、部分商品批发价高于零售价、国营贸易机关的牌价高于市价。这主要是由于通货稳定以后，虚假购买力消失，而原来被囤积的商品涌进市场，以及一般消费者因有一部分物资的积蓄，暂时减少购买量，所造成的结果。而国家财经机关对于物价稳定以后的市场趋势预见不够，未能及时采取步骤，以减轻这种不合理的价格状态，也是形成这种畸形状态的一个因素。这种畸形的价格是必须改变的，而且是已经在改变了。国家贸易机关现已着手调整价格，实行三方兼顾的政策。在调整价格中，一方面应当防止私人商业对于小生产者与消费者封建性的剥削；另一方面应当反对某些地方工作人员片面强调保护农民利益、盲目提高农产品价格的偏向。对于农产品规定过高价格的结果，将使消费者无法购买，私商也因无利可图，不肯下乡，而国营贸易机关与合作社在这种情况下即令赔本运销，也必然无法持久。这种情况必然阻塞城乡交流，不仅对国营商业、合作社商业和私人商业不利，更基本地，则是一方面对于城市工业和工人阶级不利，另一方面由于产品滞销，对于农民本身也是极端不利的。
    公私商业在销售方面所发生的重要问题，是国营零售商业问题。
    半年来，国营贸易机关为了稳定城市零售价格，设置了一定数量的零售商店，这对稳定零售价，首先是稳定人民生活必需品的零售价，保障广大城市人民生活，起了极大的作用，受到广大人民的热烈拥护。如果国营贸易机关，只进行批发贸易，不进行零售贸易，就无法实现共同纲领第三十七条所规定的“稳定物价”的任务。但国营零售商店的经营，应以稳定城市零售市场物价，防止投机商人任意抬高零售价格为目的；不应当企图代替一切私营商业。因此，国营零售商业应当适当地限制自己的经营范围，并使零售价与批发价保持适当差额，使正当零售商在国营贸易机关的价格政策之下有利可图。国营贸易机关供应物资和回笼货币主要依靠批发市场，不应依靠零售市场。国营零售商店大量零售的商品，应以粮食、食盐、煤、食油、布、煤油六种人民生活必需品为限，至于零售百货店就更应有限制些，所有各种零售店的数目以足能稳定当地商品零售价格为限度。只有这样，国营商业才能既保证了物价的平稳，又为守法的私人零售商业保留了宽广的活动范围。
    公私工商业关系，是公私兼顾政策的基础。这两方面的关系调整好了，公私兼顾的政策就在基本上实现了。
