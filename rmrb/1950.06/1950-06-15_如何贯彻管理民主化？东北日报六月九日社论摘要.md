How to Implement Democratic Management?
    --Excerpts from a Northeast Daily Editorial on June 9th--
    Regarding democratic management, since the resolution of the Sixth National Labor Congress, especially since last year, it has attracted the attention of enterprise management cadres, trade unions, and Party affairs cadres, and some achievements have been made in establishing factory management committees and other aspects. However, the problem of formalism exists rather universally in the work of factory management committees. In many places, the management committees are not functioning; individual factory and mine leaders have even proposed abolishing the management committees; and many factories and mines express doubts about the role of the management committees and worker representatives in participating in production management. The basic reason for this situation, in addition to the fact that some comrades have not yet well implemented the idea of relying on the working class to run enterprises well, is that in the current actual work, the work of democratic management is merely limited to the work of the factory management committee, without or lacking enrichment and development of its content.
    The way to solve this problem: First, educate all cadres in the enterprise so that they truly understand that implementing democratic management is one of the basic policies for running people's enterprises well. It is the concrete implementation of the Party's mass line in leading enterprise work, and it is the key to combining enterprise leadership with the broad masses of workers. In this regard, although we have done some work, we still need to do a lot of education and organization work, so that through the administrative, Party, and trade union work cadres in the enterprise, we can unite the workers, technicians, and staff in the enterprise, and improve their enthusiasm to participate in the management of people's enterprises.
    Second, according to our research on the experience of some factories and mines, in order to implement democratic management, the following work needs to be carried out:
    A. Transform the factory's production plan into each employee's own plan, and make each employee aware of the status of plan implementation and the factory's profits and losses. The factory director should report the production summary of the previous month and the production plan for the next month to all factory employees or the employee representative meeting on a monthly basis, and listen to the employees' opinions. When the branch factories and workshops formulate specific plans for their departments based on the overall plan of the factory, they should also report to and organize discussions with the employees.
    B. Important issues concerning management and technology in the factory should be organized for relevant employees to discuss and resolve.
    C. When formulating various rules and regulations of the factory, they should be discussed and drafted with all factory employees and staff, finalized by the administration, and after finalization, employees should be organized to discuss them in depth so that they can truly understand and consciously abide by them.
    D. First, concentrate efforts on doing a good job in the work of technical workers, and promote workers with technical experience, organizational skills, and close ties with the broad masses of employees to serve as cadres for Party and trade union work, especially administrative management cadres. These worker cadres are the best bridge and the most powerful assistants connecting enterprise leadership with the broad masses of employees.
    E. Transform and strengthen the leadership of the workshops, so that the production commanders, trade union and Party workers in the workshops are staffed by workers who have been tested, have technical experience and organizational skills, especially the workshop directors, team leaders, and group leaders, and special attention should be paid to their selection, in order to organize the on-site leadership force layer by layer. Through the trade union, organize the workers, technicians, and staff in the workshop, hold good production meetings in the workshop, and first implement the democratization of workshop management, which is the foundation for implementing the democratization of factory management.
    F. The leading cadres of the factory's administration, Party committee, trade union, and Communist Youth League must unite and face production together, which is the prerequisite for doing a good job in the democratization of factory management. The existing experience in this regard is: administrative management cadres should frequently go deep into the front line to solve problems concretely, answer all questions from employees, "say what they mean and do what they say," and pay close attention to labor protection and welfare facilities; in addition, they should actively solicit opinions from the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League on improving production, provide them with various conveniences for their work, and actively assist in the Party and mass work. In terms of Party and mass work cadres, they should actively engage in production, closely cooperate with administrative management, and regard the completion and exceeding of the plan as their top priority.
    G. Unite the implementation of democratic management with the improvement of the production responsibility system and the strengthening of labor discipline. Make the democratization of enterprise management a democracy with responsibility, and make the responsibility system of the enterprise a responsibility system based on democracy. Combine the management democracy in the process of discussing and deciding issues with the factory director responsibility system in the implementation process, so as to combine leadership with the masses, and combine the workers' labor creation with the technicians' scientific guidance.
    Experience has proven that our factory management committees and employee representative meetings, which are built on the above foundation, have richer content and less formalism. It is necessary to hold good factory management committees. The standing committee of the management committee must announce the issues to be discussed and resolved by the management committee to all factory employees, especially the members of the management committee, five to seven days before the meeting, so as to widely collect opinions in advance and conduct full deliberation and discussion among the employees, and then bring them to the management committee. In the process of carrying out this work, the Party should actively carry out ideological and political mobilization through the trade union, organize discussions and summarize opinions, so that the worker representatives can truly concentrate and represent the opinions of the broad masses of employees; instead of reflecting problems in a fragmented and piecemeal manner, or making the worker representatives speechless at the meeting, forming a formalistic phenomenon of sitting on the sidelines.

　　如何贯彻管理民主化？
    ——东北日报六月九日社论摘要——
    对于管理民主化，自第六次全国劳动大会决议后，特别是去年以来，已引起了企业管理干部与工会及党务工作干部的注意，并在建立工厂管理委员会等方面作出了一些成绩。但在工厂管理委员会的工作上相当普遍地存在着形式主义的毛病。很多地方，管委会不起作用；个别厂矿的负责人甚至提出了不要管委会；不少厂矿对管委会与工人代表参加生产管理的作用表示怀疑。产生这种情况的基本原因，除了有些同志对于依靠工人阶级办好企业的思想还没有很好地贯彻外，而在当前实际工作中，主要是把管理民主化的工作仅仅局限在工厂管理委员会工作上，而没有或缺乏充实与发展它的内容。
    解决这个问题的办法：第一是教育全体企业中的干部，使他们真正懂得：实行管理民主化是办好人民企业的基本政策之一。它是党在领导企业工作中的群众路线的具体实施，是企业领导与全体职工群众相结合的关键。在这一方面，我们虽已做了一些工作，但还要做许多教育与组织工作，以便通过企业中行政的、党的与工会的工作干部，来团结企业中的工人、技术人员与职员，提高他们的积极性，参加人民企业的管理工作。
    第二、根据我们研究一些厂矿的经验，为了贯彻管理民主化，须要进行以下的工作：
    甲、把工厂的生产计划，变为每个职工自己的计划，把计划执行的状况与工厂的盈亏情形，使每个职工都知道。厂长要按月向全厂职工或职工代表会报告上月生产总结与下月生产计划，听取职工的意见。各分厂、车间根据全厂总的计划拟定本部门具体计划时，也同样应该向职工报告与组织其讨论。
    乙、工厂中关于管理与技术方面比较重大的问题，都要组织有关职工讨论解决。
    丙、在制定工厂的各种规程与制度时，要同全厂职工商讨拟订，由行政最后确定，在确定之后，还要组织职工深入讨论，使其真正了解，以便自觉遵守。
    丁、首先集中力量做好技术工人的工作，提拔有技术经验、组织能力以及与广大职工有密切联系的工人，充当党与工会工作的干部，特别是行政管理干部。这些工人干部是企业领导与广大职工联系最好的桥梁与最有力的助手。
    戊、改造与加强车间的领导，使车间的生产指挥人员、工会与党的工作人员，由经过考验的、有技术经验与组织才能的工人担任，特别是车间的主任、班长、组长，尤须注意选择，以便一层一层组织现场的领导力量。通过工会，把车间的工人、技术人员与职员组织起来，开好车间的生产会议，首先贯彻车间管理的民主化，这是实行全厂管理民主化的基础。
    己、工厂的行政、党委、工会、青年团的领导干部，要团结一致，面向生产，这是搞好工厂管理民主化的前提。这方面已有的经验是：行政管理干部，要经常深入现场，具体解决问题，对职工的各种建议，“有问必答”，“说到做到”，切实注意劳动保护与福利设施；此外并要主动地征求党、工会与青年团方面关于改进生产的意见，给他们以工作的各种便利条件，积极协助党和群众工作之进行。在党和群众工作干部方面，则是主动地搞生产，与行政管理密切配合，重视行政的生产计划，把完成与超过计划当做自己的头等任务。
    庚、把实行管理民主化与健全生产责任制和加强劳动纪律统一起来。使企业的管理民主化成为有责任制的民主，使企业的责任制成为民主基础上的责任制。将在讨论和决定问题过程中的管理民主制与在执行过程中的厂长负责制结合起来，从而使领导与群众结合起来，使工人的劳动创造与技术人员的科学指导结合起来。
    经验证明，我们的工厂管理委员会与职工代表会，凡是建筑在上述基础上的，其内容就比较丰富，而形式主义就少。要开好工厂管理委员会。管理委员会的常委会，须要把管理委员会准备讨论与解决的问题，在开会前五天至七天公告全厂职工特别是管委会的委员，以便能事先广泛搜集意见，并在职工中进行充分的酝酿与讨论，然后带到管理委员会上来。在进行这一工作的过程中，党应该通过工会积极进行思想政治动员，组织讨论与综合意见，使工人代表真正能集中代表广大职工群众的意见；而不是零碎的片断的反映问题，或使工人代表在会上无言可发，形成坐冷板凳的形式主义现象。
