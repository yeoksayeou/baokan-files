　　Central People's Government Directly Subordinate Organs
　　Will Establish Youth League Work Committee
　　[Report from this newspaper] More than 200 cadres at or above the level of branch secretary of the Youth League in the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government held their first joint meeting on the afternoon of the 5th. Luo Feng, Chief of the Directly Subordinate Section of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Youth League, pointed out: Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, under the direct leadership and assistance of the Party Committee, 118 Youth League branches have been established in various units of the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government, and 5,193 Youth League members have been developed. The League has played a certain role in assisting the Party in completing administrative tasks. However, because a Youth League Work Committee has not been established in the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government, the lack of unified leadership has limited the League's role and the exchange of experience to a certain extent. Therefore, the Youth League Work Committee of the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government will be established in mid-June. Liang Hua, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government, emphasized in his speech: Young people account for about half of the working cadres of the Central People's Government, and the work of the League is very important. The cadres of the League must strive to complete this glorious task entrusted by the Party. At the meeting, Comrade Qian Feng arranged the work of the League Work Committee for June; Youth League work cadres from more than ten units, including the State Council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Education, put forward many constructive opinions on the future work of the Youth League Work Committee of the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government.

　　中央人民政府直属机关
    将成立青年团工作委会
    【本报讯】青年团中央人民政府各直属机关支部书记以上干部二百余人于五日下午举行了第一次联席会议。青年团中央组织部直属科科长洛风指出：自从中央人民政府成立后，在党委的直接领导与帮助下，在中央人民政府直属机关各单位内已建立青年团支部一一八个，发展了团员五一九三名。团在协助党完成行政任务中，起了一定的作用。但因为没有建立中央人民政府直属机关团工委，缺乏统一领导，使团的作用的发挥与经验的交流，都受到一定的限制。因之中央人民政府直属机关团工委将于六月中旬成立。中央人民政府直属机关中共党委会书记梁华在讲话中强调指出：中央人民政府工作干部中，青年约占半数，团的工作是很重要的，团的工作干部要努力完成党所交付的这一光荣任务。会中并由钱峰同志布置了团工委六月份的工作；政务院、外交部、农业部、教育部等十余单位的青年团工作干部对今后中央人民政府直属机关团工委工作提出了许多建设性的意见。
