　　Sound Organizational Structure Improves Teacher Quality
    Southern Anhui Rectifies Primary Education
    [Our Wuhu Dispatch] Since the beginning of the term, primary education in the Southern Anhui region has undergone a preliminary rectification, improving organizational structures and enhancing teacher quality. Prior to this, many primary schools in Southern Anhui suffered from small student bodies, large organizations, and an excess of teachers. Some classes had only ten or fewer students. This phenomenon was even more pronounced in complete primary schools (完小), where some senior grades did not have enough students to form a single class, resulting in a waste of funds and manpower. Secondly, the teaching staff was not pure, with a few teachers unable to adequately perform their teaching duties. The personnel allocation in various primary schools was also unbalanced, with uneven distribution of strong and weak teachers. The focus of this rectification is to adjust the organizational structure of complete primary schools. For urban complete primary schools, each class is generally required to have around 40 to 50 students; rural complete primary schools should have no fewer than 30 students per class, and those with fewer students should implement combined-grade teaching. At the same time, each complete primary school should have at least one complete senior grade class. Those with fewer than 30 students should be reorganized into senior groups, attached to junior primary schools. The complete primary schools should be converted into junior primary schools, run by the villages themselves. In terms of teaching staff, appropriate adjustments have been made to the unbalanced allocation of manpower in complete and junior primary schools. Individual teachers who do not meet the requirements are being helped to transfer to production; some teachers who are qualified but temporarily unemployed are being organized into rotating training classes by the special commissioner's offices for intensive training. In personnel adjustments, special attention is being paid to promoting backbone elements to leadership positions.
    After this preliminary rectification, the organizational structure of primary schools in various places is more sound than before, and the teaching staff is also more orderly. Therefore, it not only reduces expenditure but also improves teaching effectiveness. For example, in She County, the number of complete primary schools before the rectification was 66 schools, with 182 classes and 314 teachers, serving 6,262 students. After the rectification, although the number of students increased to 8,164, the number of schools decreased to 47, with 201 classes and the number of teachers decreased to 305. The teacher training classes in the three special commissioner areas of Wudang, Xuancheng, and Chizhou have a total of 355 students, most of whom are surplus personnel from the reorganization of primary school institutions. The participation of these people in training has improved the teachers' political and professional level and has reserved talent for the future development of primary education. The areas where the rectification of primary school work has been done well generally first clear up the thinking of teachers, the masses, and some district and township cadres, so that they understand the significance of the reorganization. On the one hand, it saves expenditure and overcomes current difficulties; on the other hand, it improves the organizational structure and enhances the quality of teachers, creating a foundation for the future development of primary education. At the same time, properly handling surplus teachers allows them to concentrate on learning or transferring to production. Some areas have produced deviations in this work. Some rigidly insisted on one complete primary school in each district. As a result, those with more could not be canceled, and those with fewer were reluctantly retained, losing the original meaning of the reorganization. Individual counties stipulate that each class must have at least 40 people, which is not suitable for the current economic and cultural development of rural areas. In the rectification of personnel, some areas have inappropriately eliminated teachers, and in some places, there have been too many personnel transfers, which has affected teaching. The leading organs of the district have made appropriate corrections to these. At present, they are committed to further improving the teaching work of various schools. (Wang Ying)

　　健全组织机构提高师资质量
    皖南整顿小学教育
    【本报芜湖讯】皖南区的小学教育，本期开学后普遍地进行了一次初步的整顿，健全了组织机构，提高了师资。在此以前，皖南区许多小学有学生少、机构大、教师多的现象。有的每班仅十余人，甚至在十人以下。这种现象在完小中更为严重，有的完小全部高年级学生还不够成立一个班，造成经费与人力的浪费。其次，教师队伍还很不纯，有少数教师不能胜任教学工作。各小学人事配备也不够平衡，师资强弱不匀。此次整顿的重点是调整完小的组织机构。对城镇完小，一般要求每班要在四十人至五十人左右；乡村完小每班不能少于三十人，不足者合班复式教学。同时，每个完小至少要有一个完整的高级班，人数不足三十人者改成高级组，附设在初小里，将完小改成初小，由村自办。在师资方面，各完小、初小的人力配备过于不平衡的作了适当的调整。个别不够条件的教师帮助其转业生产；一部分有条件但暂无工作的教师，由各专署组织轮训班集训，在人事调整中，特别注意将骨干分子提拔到领导位置上去。
    经过了这次初步的整顿，各地小学的组织机构比以前健全了，教师阵容也较整齐了，因此，不独减少了开支，也提高了教学效果。如歙县全县的完小：整顿前有学生六、二六二人，共设六十六校，一八二班，教师三一四人。整顿后，学生虽增至八、一六四人，而学校减至四十七所，共设二○一班，教师减少至三○五人。芜当、宣城、池州三个专区的教师轮训班，共有学员三五五人，其中绝大部分是整顿小学机构时的编余人员。这些人的参加受训，提高了教师的政治、业务水平，为今后发展小学教育储备了人材。此次整顿小学工作做得较好的地区，一般是首先打通教师、群众和一部分区乡干部的思想，使其明了整编的意义，一面节省开支，度过目前的困难；一面健全组织机构，提高师资，为今后发展小学教育创立基础。同时，妥善地处理编余教师，使其安心学习或转入生产。某些地区在此一工作中曾产生偏向，有的硬性地坚持一区一个完小，结果，多的不能取消，少的勉强保留下来，失去整编原意。个别县则规定每班至少四十人，这对目前农村经济、文化发展情况都不适合。在人事的整顿上，个别地区曾不适当地淘汰教师，有的地方人事调动太多，影响了教学。这些，该区领导机关已作适当的纠正。目前，正致力于进一步提高与改进各校的教学工作。（王影）
