Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 17th. From the 13th to the 14th, Hebei Province experienced widespread rainfall, enabling farmers in some areas to rush transplant rice seedlings and sow drought-resistant crops. Hubei Province has experienced scarce rainfall for nearly two months, leading to the drying up of mountain ponds and reservoirs, preventing irrigation for rice transplanting and hindering the sowing of drought-resistant grains, resulting in drought conditions. In the cotton-growing areas of northern Hubei, cotton seedlings are already withering. Therefore, farmers are eagerly hoping for rain. To address this, the provincial people's government has taken emergency drought prevention measures, allocating 8 million catties of rice as interest-free loans to poor farmers in drought-stricken areas to purchase drought-resistant crops and late rice seeds. It has also called on farmers to dig wells and ditches to rush planting. Farmers in Guangfu Township in the suburbs of Wuhan organized to divert water from Houhu Lake to irrigate 1,600 mu of farmland. The recent rainfall in the Wuchang area was 35.8 millimeters. The rainfall was even greater in western Hubei counties, and rice transplanting is no longer a problem in Yichang, Jingzhou, and other special districts. The rainfall in eastern Hubei was relatively small. Under the leadership of the people's government, local farmers are seizing the opportunity to rush transplant late rice seedlings and sow drought-resistant crops such as buckwheat, corn, and mung beans. Generally, cotton seedlings in drought-affected cotton fields have also begun to turn green, and cotton farmers are excitedly applying fertilizer and weeding. In order to strive to complete this year's grain production task, the provincial people's government has instructed the Mianyang, Jingzhou, Daye, Xiaogan, and other special districts to mobilize and organize farmers to universally increase the planting of late rice in the lake areas and to reclaim lake fields and widely plant late rice.

　　湖北普降时雨
    【新华社汉口十七日电】河北省于十三日至十四日普降甘雨，部分地区农民突击插秧和抢种旱地作物。近两月来湖北雨量稀少，致山地塘堰多干涸，无水灌田插秧，旱地杂粮多未播种，形成旱象。鄂北植棉地区，棉苗已呈萎枯。故农民盼雨极为殷切。该省人民政府为此曾作紧急防旱措施，拨出大米八百万斤，无利贷予受旱地区的贫苦农民购买旱地作物和晚稻种籽；并号召农民凿井开沟，进行抢种。武汉市郊区广福乡农民，即曾组织起来引后湖湖水，灌田一千六百亩。这次武昌地区获雨三五点八米厘。鄂西各县雨量更大，宜昌、荆州等专区插秧已无困难。鄂东雨量较小，当地农民在人民政府的领导下，正抓紧时机抢插晚秧和抢种荞麦、包谷、绿豆等旱地作物。一般受旱棉田棉苗亦开始转青，棉农正兴奋地追肥锄草。为了争取完成本年粮食生产任务，该省人民政府已指示沔阳、荆州、大冶、孝感等专区，动员与组织农民，在滨湖地区普遍增插一季晚稻，并要求开垦湖田，广种晚稻。
