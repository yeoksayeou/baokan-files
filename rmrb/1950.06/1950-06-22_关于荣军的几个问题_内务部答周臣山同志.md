To the Editor, Comrade Zhou Chenshan:

    Here are the answers to the several questions you forwarded from Comrade Zhou Chenshan regarding veterans:

    I. The cap badge and insignia of the People's Liberation Army are symbols of the army's regular organization. When veterans transfer to local work or reside in veterans' schools, they are no longer part of the army's organization. Therefore, they should no longer wear army cap badges and insignia. However, this does not diminish the veteran's political status.

    II. Students at veterans' schools are admitted through introductions from provincial governments or veterans' management organizations. Veterans' schools cannot directly accept them. As for veterans who have already been discharged and returned to their hometowns, the focus should be on production and employment. If they wish to study, they can apply to various schools based on their education level. Under the same conditions, schools should give them priority in admission. At the same time, when organizing various training courses, all localities should pay attention to absorbing veterans in their hometowns.

    III. Veterans who participate in the work of local government agencies and organizations should wear the badges of their respective organizations. Those living collectively in veterans' schools should wear the veterans' school badge (which will be formulated soon). However, after veterans are discharged and return to their hometowns, there is no need to wear a special badge other than keeping their own disability certificate.

　　关于荣军的几个问题
    内务部答周臣山同志编辑同志：
    你们转来的周臣山同志所问关于荣誉军人的几个问题，答复于下：
    一、人民解放军之帽徽、军章是军队正规编制的标志。荣军转到地方工作或住荣军学校均不属于军队编制，故不应再配戴军队帽徽及军章。但这并不降低荣军的政治地位。
    二、荣军学校学员，都是经省政府或荣军管理机关介绍入校的，荣校不能直接收容。至于已经退伍回乡之荣军，应以生产就业为主。如愿意学习，可视其文化程度，投考各种学校。在同等条件下，学校应尽先录取。同时各地办理各种训练班时，应注意吸收在乡荣军。
    三、荣军如参加地方机关团体工作，即佩戴所属机关证章。在荣校过团体生活者，应该佩戴荣校证章（即将制定）。但荣军退伍回乡以后，除保存本人残废证外，无佩戴特别证章之必要。
