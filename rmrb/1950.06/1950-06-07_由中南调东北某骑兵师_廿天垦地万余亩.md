Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Electric Dispatch: A certain cavalry division of the People's Liberation Army, transferred from the Central and Southern China region to garrison and engage in production in Northeast China, has now enthusiastically thrown itself into the production movement. This unit, after a month-long march from Central and Southern China, arrived in Northeast China in mid-April. On April 2nd, while en route, all the officers and soldiers of the division were inspected and received instructions from Commander-in-Chief Zhu De in the capital, Beijing. After the troops arrived in the reclamation area, their production enthusiasm was extremely high. Within the twenty days leading up to May 10th, they had reclaimed more than 10,000 mu of paddy and dry land, and constructed 220,000 meters of rice paddy irrigation canals and embankment. The sowing of dry land has generally begun. All officers and soldiers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm in production, overcoming difficulties and fatigue, and production efficiency has gradually increased. Initially, a certain regiment could only plow three mu of land per day with a foreign plow, but later they achieved a record of plowing fifteen mu of wasteland per day. The entire officers and soldiers of the Fourth Company of a certain regiment recently wrote a letter to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, reporting on their production situation, saying: "Every comrade has kept your words in mind. We are working hard to establish state farms and increase national wealth. We are happily undertaking the production tasks for 1950, and we are fully confident that we can make even greater contributions to the people on the production front."
