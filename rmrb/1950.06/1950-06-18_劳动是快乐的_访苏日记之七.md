　　Labor is Happiness
　　——Diary of a Visit to the Soviet Union, No. 7
　　Zhao Guoyou
　　When I first arrived in Moscow, I found it very strange: there were very few people on the streets during the day, but after seven or eight o'clock in the evening, there were as many people on the streets as if they were in a parade. Pairs of men and women, arm in arm, walked along talking and laughing. The men were all wearing suits, the women had permed hair, wore high heels, and powdered their faces. You could smell their fragrance from afar. I wondered: what do they all do? I asked Old Chen, who had been to the Soviet Union earlier. He said, "They are all workers!" The lives of Soviet workers are indeed too good. There are cars all over the streets, many of which are owned by the workers themselves.
　　From the places we visited, we could see the happy lives of Soviet workers everywhere. For example, going to the theater: the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow is so large, with five floors, but every time we went, we saw it was packed. We saw the Moscow stadium, which can hold more than 100,000 people. On the day of a game, even the corridors were full of people; many people couldn't get in and were peering in from the outside. Cultural palaces, parks, it was all like this everywhere.
　　What I admire most in the Soviet Union is the spirit of learning of the Soviet working people. Our Chinese delegation visited the Kirov Cultural Palace in Leningrad. There is a library with 20,000 books, and the reading room is particularly large. When we visited, it was already crowded inside, and many people were sitting outside reading. This cultural palace is very large in scale. Inside, there are poetry groups, opera groups, music groups, sports groups, dance groups, cinemas, theaters, technical research laboratories, etc. Under the children's department alone, there are music teams, piano classes, shipbuilding classes, airplane building classes, train research rooms, various crane research rooms, plant rooms (studying Michurin plants), children's libraries, astronomy and geography research rooms, radio research rooms, photography research rooms, children's cinemas and other departments. There are many films here that are specially used to explain history and geography to children.
　　The Soviet government's care for the working people is meticulous. The safety equipment in factories is very thorough. Every factory has charts, and new employees must first understand the machine process by looking at the charts before they can officially start working. Newly opened factories cannot start work if the equipment is not complete and has not been approved and stamped by the Minister of Labor Protection. We visited a research institute in Leningrad. It brings together 150 experts who specialize in researching labor protection work. According to the comrade in charge of this research institute, the Soviet government allocated 5 billion rubles for research funding in the first five-year plan after the war. In fifteen years, they have researched more than a thousand labor protection methods, reducing the injury rate of employees in various factories by three times compared to before the war. In this research institute alone, there are eleven research rooms for technical safety, electrical safety, production discipline, protection, sound reduction, physical chemistry, ventilation equipment, weather and climate, dust reduction, lighting, and technical assistance.
　　I feel that seeing the happy lives of Soviet workers is also seeing the future of Chinese workers' lives. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, as long as everyone works hard, we will slowly reach the point of being like Soviet workers.

　　劳动是快乐的
    ——访苏日记之七
    赵国有
    我刚到莫斯科的时候，觉得很奇怪：白天街上人很少，一到下午七、八点钟以后，街上的人就像游行一样多。一对一对的男女，挎着胳膊，连说带笑地走着，男的都穿着西装，女的都烫着发，穿着高跟鞋，脸上还抹着粉，很远就觉得香气扑鼻。我心里想：他们都是干什么的？我问早先去过苏联的老陈。他说：“他们都是工人哪！”苏联工人的生活的确太好了，满街的汽车，很多是工人自己的。
    从我们参观过的地方，到处可以看到苏联工人的幸福生活。比方看戏吧，莫斯科大戏院那样大，五层楼，可是我们每天去的时候，都看到人挤得满满的。我们看到莫斯科能容十几万人的大球场，在赛球那天，连走廊都站满了人；有很多人挤不进去，就在外边扒着头往里看。文化宫、公园、到处都是这样。
    在苏联使我最羡慕的，是苏联劳动人民的学习精神。我们中国代表团在列宁格勒参观了基洛夫文化宫。这里有两万册书的大图书馆，阅览室也特别大。我们去参观时，里面挤满人还不算，外面也坐着许多人在看书。这个文化宫规模很大，里面有诗歌组、歌剧组、音乐组、体育组、跳舞组、电影院、剧院、技术研究室等。单在儿童部下面，就又分音乐队、钢琴班、造船班、造飞机班、火车研究室、各种起重机研究室、植物室（研究米丘林植物）、儿童图书馆、天文地理研究室、无线电研究室、照像研究室、小孩电影院等部门。这里有很多的电影片子，是专供给小孩子们讲解历史、地理用的。
    苏联政府对劳动人民的关心，是无微不至的。工厂的安全设备非常周到。每个工厂都有图表，新来厂工作的，必须先让他们看图表明白机器过程以后，才正式入场工作。新开办的工厂，如果设备不完善，不经劳保部长批准盖章，就不能开工。我们在列宁格勒参观了一个研究院。这里集中了一百五十个专家们，专门在研究劳动保护工作。据这个研究院的负责同志说：苏联政府在战后第一个五年计划中，就拿出了五十亿卢布作研究经费。他们在十五年当中，已经研究出一千多种劳保方法，使各工厂的职工受伤率，比战前降低了三倍。光在这个研究院里，就有技术安全、电力安全、生产纪律、防护、减少声音、物理化学、通风设备、天气与气候、减少灰尘、照明、技术帮助等十一个研究室。
    我觉得：看到苏联工人的幸福生活，也就是看到了中国工人生活的远景。在中国共产党的领导下，只要大家努力，我们也一定会慢慢的走到像苏联工人那样的地步。
