　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 18th: *Pravda* observer, Tarenteyev, commenting on the fifth session of the Economic Commission for Europe, pointed out: The United States and the United Kingdom are using every possible means to obstruct the activities of the Economic Commission for Europe. The United States is pursuing a selfish policy that violates the interests of the people of European countries. Through the Marshall Plan, it forces Western European countries to accept large quantities of dumped American goods, causing Western European production to shrink, unemployment to increase, and deepening their economic crisis. American monopolists are putting pressure on Western European countries to prevent them from trading with Eastern European countries. This further exacerbates the market problems of Western European countries and increases their dependence on the United States.
　　The Soviet representative put forward a number of proposals at this meeting of the Economic Commission for Europe. These proposals stipulate that some suggestions should be drafted on the development and expansion of trade between European countries. The Soviet proposal shows that the Soviet Union is sincerely striving to inject new vitality into the activities of the association.
　　The people of European countries are paying attention to the work of this meeting of the Economic Commission for Europe, and they have gained another opportunity to recognize that the Soviet Union is truly striving to consolidate the United Nations and promote the development of normal economic relations between countries, while the US-UK bloc is destroying the United Nations, causing the economic disintegration of Western European countries, and destroying it to submit to the selfish interests of American monopoly capital.

    美英集团破坏联合国使西欧各国经济解体
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报观察家台伦特耶夫在评论欧洲经济委员会第五次会议时指出：美国和英国用尽一切可能的方法来阻挠欧洲经济委员会的活动。美国在实行着违反欧洲各国人民利益的自私政策。它借马歇尔计划强迫西欧各国接受大批倾销的美国货，而使西欧各国生产萎缩、失业增加，加深了它们的经济危机。美国垄断资本家对西欧各国施以压力，阻止它们与东欧国家贸易。这使西欧各国的市场问题更趋恶化，并且增加了它们对美国的依赖性。
    苏联代表在这次欧洲经济委员会会议上提出了若干提案。这些提案规定就发展并扩大欧洲国家之间的贸易草拟一些建议。苏联的提案表明苏联真心诚意地力求把新的活力灌输到该会的活动中去。
    欧洲各国人民注视着这次欧洲经济委员会会议的工作，他们又多得了一个机会认识到：苏联是真正力求巩固联合国、促进各国间正常经济关系的发展的，而美英集团却在破坏联合国，使西欧各国的经济解体，并予以摧毁，使之服从于美国垄断资本的自私利益。
