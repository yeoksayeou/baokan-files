Gaoyang County's Entire Party Member Cadres Examine the Ideology of "Don't Wash Your Dirty Linen in Public"
    Zhang Pulu, Wang Chuntian
    All county and district Party member cadres in Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, participated in the study of several documents, including the decision to conduct criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals, and made preliminary self-examinations based on the actual situation. At the same time, at an enlarged meeting of the county party committee (with the participation of key cadres from various departments), they conducted a more comprehensive self-examination based on the documents and the specific situation of the county, and put forward and analyzed several erroneous views of Party member cadres on criticism and self-criticism.
    These erroneous views are primarily reflected in the bias of only reporting good news and not reporting bad news in reporting work. Only pay attention to reporting achievements, not to reporting shortcomings. Afraid that public criticism in the newspaper would affect the unity between departments. For example, last year, the Gaoyang branch of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company had a purely profit-seeking view. At that time, the secretary of the county party committee, Zhang Minhan, and the company's manager, Wang Wanlong, talked about it several times, but it was not resolved. This kind of attitude of not humbly examining and not correcting in time should be publicly criticized in the newspaper. However, because of the fear of causing disagreement, this issue was not disclosed in the newspaper. Another example is that when comrades Lin Fang and others from the Hebei Daily went to Gaoyang to interview, they wrote two articles reporting on the Gaoyang cloth industry. At that time, the county party committee raised opinions on revisions to the parts of the article that did not match the facts, but they were not published according to the corrected opinions. Because the manuscript praised Gaoyang's cloth industry, the county party committee did not raise any more opinions, even though there were discrepancies with the facts. Secondly, many cadres are not receptive to criticism and often adopt a passive resistance or even confrontational attitude. For example, in the wage dispute between the Gaoyang Grain Depot and the porters, the porters' union made a criticism in the newspaper. Because some parts were somewhat different from the actual situation, and because the person who wrote the article was worried, they did not write their real name, so the Grain Depot seized on this point and went to the government or the trade union to investigate the writer. They only emphasized the individual discrepancies with the actual situation without humbly accepting its correct opinions. For example, after the newspaper criticized the purely profit-seeking phenomenon of the Gaoyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the director of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative not only did not make a profound self-examination but claimed that it was a thing of the past and had now been corrected.
    In the county party committee's thinking, it is not clear enough to use criticism and self-criticism to improve and promote work. On the contrary, there is a view of "don't wash your dirty linen in public." When problems arise in work, they are willing to conduct criticism within their own units or departments but are unwilling to conduct public criticism and self-criticism in newspapers or on a larger scale. For example, in the production and disaster relief work in the Second District, there was a phenomenon that the main force was not placed in the severely affected villages, and ordinary cadres were unwilling to work in the severely affected villages. The county party committee wrote a notice to criticize this, and the district chief, Zhang Enrong, expressed great dissatisfaction and even lost his temper. The county party committee should have given severe public criticism in the newspaper on this issue, but they believed that this was an internal problem and could be resolved by further discussion, and they were unwilling to expose the shortcomings of the county. When the government mobilized disaster victims to engage in sideline production last year, the disaster-stricken women of Mengzhongfeng Village and Nanbei Fotang Village in the Third District wove more than a thousand zhang of small fishing nets. Because there was no market locally, it was too far to promote them elsewhere, and the nets were largely stockpiled. After repeated inquiries from the disaster victims to the cooperative, it was always ineffective. At this time, the communications officer proposed to Liu Xizhen, the head of the organization department of the county party committee, to write an article criticizing the supply and marketing cooperative, but Liu Xizhen said: "Criticizing in the newspaper is also to solve the problem. Let's talk to the supply and marketing cooperative about this and let him change it." But even now, some small nets are still stockpiled and have not been sold.
    In addition, there is a sense of complacency among the cadres, and they cannot see the problems and shortcomings in their work. Sometimes, when some shortcomings are discovered, they are always considered minor, and public criticism is rarely made of the shortcomings. Sometimes, opinions are put forward in the form of a notice, but whether the other party has corrected the shortcomings after the opinions are put forward is no longer asked. This year, when planting cotton in the Fourth District, some villages found that individual households had destroyed other crops to complete the cotton planting task. At that time, the leaders of the county and district did not see that this was a bad result of coercive orders and did not promptly criticize and correct it.
    Based on the above self-examination, the county party committee decided to convene an enlarged meeting of the district party committees and county-level activists to implement the spirit of the Central Committee on carrying out criticism and self-criticism, call on party member cadres to seriously study the documents on criticism and self-criticism, and conscientiously implement them in actual work. At the same time, among the county's correspondents, it is called to use newspapers to carry out criticism and self-criticism, overcome the bias of reporting only good news and not reporting bad news, and should be commended and promoted when there are achievements and advantages; and criticized and alerted when there are problems and shortcomings.

　　高阳县全体党员干部检讨“家丑不可外扬”思想
    张蒲芦　王春田
    中共河北高阳县全体县、区党员干部都参加了关于在报纸刊物上开展批评与自我批评的决定等几个文件的学习，并结合实际情况作了初步检讨。同时在县委扩大会议上（并有各部门主要干部参加），又根据文件结合本县的具体情况作了比较全面的检讨，提出并分析了党员干部对批评与自我批评的几种错误观点。
    这些错误观点，首先表现在报道工作上存在着报喜不报忧的偏向。只注意报道成绩，不注意报道缺点。恐怕在报纸上公开批评后，影响部门间的不团结。如去年花纱布公司高阳支公司存在着单纯的营利观点，当时经县委书记张敏汉和该公司经理王万隆面谈数次，未得解决。像这种不虚心检讨，不及时纠正的态度，应在报纸上予以公开批评。但因怕闹意见，就没有将此问题在报纸上披露。又如河北日报社记者林放等同志，到高阳采访，写了两篇报道高阳布业的稿子，当时县委对文中与事实情况不符的地方，曾提出了修改意见，但是没有按照修正意见发表。因为该稿是表扬高阳的布业，所以虽与事实有出入，县委就没有再提意见。其次，有不少干部对批评不虚心接受，而且往往抱着消极抵抗甚至对抗的态度。如高阳粮栈与搬运工人的工资纠纷问题，搬运工会在报纸上提出了批评，因为有些地方与实际情况有些出入，又因写此稿的人有顾虑，没有写出真名字，粮栈就抓住了这一点，到政府或工会追究写稿人。只强调其中个别与实际情况有出入的地方而不虚心接受其正确的意见。又如报纸上批评了高阳供销社的单纯营利现象后，供销社主任不但不作深刻检讨，却推说是过去的事情现在已经改正。
    在县委思想上，对于运用批评和自我批评去改进工作推动工作，也不够明确，相反地存在着“家丑不可外扬”的观点。工作中有了问题愿在本单位、本部门进行批评，而不愿在报纸上或较大的范围进行公开的批评和自我批评。如二区在生产救灾工作中，发生了不把主要力量放在重灾村，一般干部不乐意到重灾村工作的现象，县委会写了通报予以批评，该区区长张恩荣表示很不满意，甚至大发脾气。对此问题县委是应该在报纸上再给以严厉的公开批评的，但却认为这是内部问题，可以再谈谈解决就算了，不愿意暴露出本县的缺点。去年政府发动灾民搞副业生产时，三区孟仲峰村和南北佛堂村的灾民妇女，织了千余丈捕鱼的小网子。因为本地没有销路，到外地去推销较远，网子便大批积压起来，经灾民数次向合作社催问始终无效。这时通讯干事向县委组织部长刘锡珍提议要写稿向供销社提出批评，但刘锡珍说：“在报纸上批评也是为了解决问题呀，这事咱们和供销社谈一下让他改了就算了。”但直到现在还有一部分小网子积压着没有推销出去。
    另外，在干部中存在着一种自满情绪，看不出自己工作中的问题与缺点。有时发现一些缺点，也总认为是小事，很少对缺点进行公开批评。有时用通报形式提出意见，至于意见提出后对方是否纠正了缺点，也就不再追问了。今年四区在植棉时，有些村子发现个别户，有为了完成种棉任务而毁了别的庄稼的现象，当时县区领导上就没有看出这是强迫命令作风所造成的恶果，而及时予以批评纠正。
    县委根据以上检讨，决定召开各区区委及县级活动分子扩大会议，贯彻中央关于开展批评和自我批评的精神，号召党员干部认真学习批评与自我批评的文件，并在实际工作中认真执行。同时在全县通讯员中号召使用报纸开展批评与自我批评，克服报喜不报忧的偏向，应该是有成绩、有优点时加以表扬和推广；有问题，有缺点时加以批评和警惕。
