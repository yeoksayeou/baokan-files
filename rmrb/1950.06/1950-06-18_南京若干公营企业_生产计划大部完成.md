Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th—Among the fourteen state-owned factories, mines, and public transportation enterprises in Nanjing, most units have completed or exceeded their production targets during the May production competition. Among them, the telecommunications equipment manufactured by the Radio Factory and the pyrite produced by the Ma'anshan Mining Bureau both exceeded the April production volume, with the highest exceeding by more than double. The output of light bulbs from the Electric Light Factory also exceeded the plan by one-tenth. The Nanjing Railway Locomotive Depot's transportation department had no accidents throughout the month; in addition, five chartered train groups created new records of safe driving for over 100,000 kilometers. In the May production competition, the coal consumption for power generation at the Nanjing Power Plant was 8% lower than the standard stipulated by the Central Fuel Industry Department, saving more than 700 tons of coal per month compared to before. The Waterworks also saved a large amount of electricity and alum, and eliminated theft and leakage, thereby reducing costs.

　　南京若干公营企业
    生产计划大部完成
    【新华社南京十二日电】南京市公营厂矿及公用交通企业共十四个单位，在五月份生产竞赛中，大部分单位已完成或超过生产任务。其中有线电厂所制电讯器材和马鞍山矿务局所产硫化铁，均超过四月份生产量，最高的超过达一倍以上。电照厂灯泡产量亦超过计划的十分之一。南京铁路机务段运转部门，全月未出事故；另有五个包车组创造了安全行车十万公里以上的新纪录。南京电厂在五月份生产竞赛中，发电耗煤量较中央燃料工业部规定的标准尚低百分之八，每月较前可节省煤七百吨以上。自来水厂亦节省了大批电力与明矾，并消除了偷漏现象，因而降低了成本。
