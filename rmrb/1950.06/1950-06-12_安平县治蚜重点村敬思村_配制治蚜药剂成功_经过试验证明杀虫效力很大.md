[Report from Anping] Jing Si Village, a key aphid control village in Anping County, Hebei Province, has successfully formulated an aphid control agent. After some cotton fields in the village were infested with aphids, village cadres and the technical team used tobacco water and tobacco lime water for two rounds of control, but with little effect. Later, after on-site research by Wang Zhenlai, the district head of the area, district cadre Yan Zhenguo, and cadres sent by the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the County Agriculture Science Department, and the County Farm, it was found that the proportion of tobacco leaves and lime was inaccurate, the quality of the tobacco leaves was poor, the preparation method and timing were inappropriate, and the application method was not careful enough. In order to eliminate aphids in a timely manner, it was immediately decided to personally formulate the agent and conduct experiments. In addition to having village cadres and the technical team participate, 22 cadres and technical team members from four nearby villages were also mobilized to participate. During the experiment, the proportions of four kinds of agents, namely tobacco water, tobacco nitrate ash water, tobacco lime water, and derris powder soapy water, as well as the entire process of preparation and application methods, were tested. Especially during the control experiment, more than 100 men and women from the village went to observe. After the experiment was completed in two mu of cotton fields, village cadres and the masses saw with their own eyes that 100% of the aphids had died within two hours, immediately dispelling their concerns about being unable to control the aphids. Cadres from various villages also stated that after returning to their villages, they would immediately mobilize the masses to prepare medicines and control tools, and promptly launch a comprehensive inspection and aphid eradication campaign. The method of formulating aphid control agents in this village is now introduced as follows: (1) Pure tobacco water agent ratio: one jin of fresh tobacco leaves soaked in thirty jin of water. In terms of preparation method and time, first tear the weighed one jin of tobacco leaves into pieces, soak them in fifteen jin of cold water for one day and one night, rub them several times by hand before taking out the tobacco leaves, then take them out and put the tobacco leaves into another fifteen jin of cold water and rub them to allow the toxins contained in the tobacco leaves to be leached out. After taking out the tobacco leaves, pour the water together and stir evenly, the water should turn reddish-brown before it can be used. (2) Tobacco nitrate ash water mixture preparation ratio: Use four liang of fresh tobacco leaves, half a jin of plant ash, and thirty jin of water. In terms of preparation method, first sieve the plant ash, tear the tobacco leaves into pieces, put half a jin of plant ash at the bottom of the basin, then scatter four liang of tobacco leaves on top, pour in five jin of boiling water, cover tightly, soak for one hour, mix the ash and tobacco evenly, then cover for another one or two hours and rub several times (preferably filter through cloth), add twenty-five jin of water, stir evenly until it becomes reddish-greenish gray and it can be used. (3) Tobacco lime mixture preparation ratio: six liang of tobacco leaves, ten liang of quicklime, and sixty jin of water. In terms of preparation method, slake the lime with water, then place the torn tobacco leaves on top, pour in five jin of boiling water, cover tightly, stir evenly after one hour, then cover and wait for two hours before rubbing several times, add fifty-five jin of water to make it uniform and turn orange-yellow before use; (4) Derris powder soapy water mixture preparation ratio: one liang of soap, one liang of derris powder, and thirty jin of water. The preparation method is: put the derris powder in a cloth bag, rub it in the water until only dregs are left, then take it out. Separately, cut the soap into slices, rinse it with hot water until it dissolves, mix the two together, and it can be used when it turns yellowish-brown. The above four methods, after several experiments, have the same killing power against aphids. Except for those in curled leaves that cannot be sprayed with water and did not die, all aphids that were sprayed died completely after two hours.

　　安平县治蚜重点村敬思村
    配制治蚜药剂成功       
    经过试验证明杀虫效力很大
    【本报安平讯】河北省安平县治蚜重点村——敬思村，配制治蚜药剂成功。该村部分棉田发生蚜虫后，村干部与技术小组即用烟草水、烟草石灰水进行了两次除治，但收效不大。后经该区区长王振来、区干部阎振果以及省农业厅、县农业科，县农场派赴该村的干部实地研究，发现烟叶石灰的配合量不准确，烟叶质量不好，配制法与时间不恰当，在使用方法上也不够仔细。为了及时消灭蚜虫，当即决定亲自配制药剂并作试验，除令该村干部、技术小组参加外，并发动附近四个村干部、技术小组二十二人参加。在实验中，试验了烟草水、烟草硝灰水、烟草石灰水、鱼藤粉肥皂水等四种药剂的配合量，配治法与除治法的整个过程。特别是在除治实验时，该村男女群众百余人均往参观。在二亩棉田内试验完后，经过两个钟头的时间，村干部和群众亲眼看到蚜虫百分之百的死亡，立即解除了他们无法除治的顾虑。各村干部亦表示回村后，立即发动群众，准备药品和除治工具，及时全面展开检查、消灭蚜虫运动。现将该村配制治蚜药剂的办法介绍于下：（一）纯烟草水剂配合量：生烟叶一斤浸水三十斤。在配制法及时间上，先把秤好的一斤烟叶撕碎，用十五斤凉水泡一昼夜，在捞出烟叶前用手多揉几次，然后捞出来再把烟叶放到另外十五斤凉水里揉搓，使烟叶所含的毒质浸出来，捞出烟叶后把水倒在一起搅匀，水成红褐色即可使用。（二）烟草硝灰水混合剂配制量：用生烟叶四两、草木灰半斤、水三十斤。在配制方法上，先把草木灰过箩，烟叶撕碎，在盆内把半斤草木灰放在底下，然后把四两烟叶散在上面，用开水五斤泡上盖好，浸一点钟把灰和烟拌匀，再盖一、两个钟头后揉几次（最好用布滤过），渗上二十五斤水搅匀成红绿灰色即可使用。（三）烟草石灰混合剂配制量：烟叶六两、生石灰十两、水六十斤。在配制方法上，用水将石灰化开，然后把撕碎的烟叶放在上面，用开水五斤泡上盖好，一个钟头后搅匀，再盖好等两个钟头后揉几次，将五十五斤水对入，使其均匀成橙黄色即可使用；（四）鱼藤粉肥皂水混合剂配制量：肥皂一两，鱼藤粉一两，水三十斤。配制法是：把鱼藤粉装在布口袋里，放在水里揉搓，待鱼藤粉只留下渣子即取出。另外把肥皂切成片，用热水冲一下即溶化，两者混合起来，发土黄色即可用。以上四种办法，经过几次的实验，对蚜虫的杀伤力相同，除在卷叶内喷不上水的未死外，凡经喷上的蚜虫，在经过两点钟后即全部死亡。
