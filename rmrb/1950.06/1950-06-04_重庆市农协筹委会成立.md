    Chongqing Municipal Agricultural Association Preparatory Committee Established
    The first Chongqing Municipal Peasant Representative Conference was held from May 25th to 28th. Three hundred and twenty-two representatives attended, representing 145,000 farmers in the city's suburbs. The conference discussed rural work in the suburbs of Chongqing and decided to establish a municipal farmers' association to further the struggle against bandits and special agents in the suburbs. The conference also adopted the draft of the "Provisional Regulations on Rent Reduction in the Suburbs of Chongqing," which will be submitted to the Municipal People's Government for approval and implementation. Finally, the conference elected a preparatory committee of 47 members to establish the Chongqing Municipal Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee. After the liberation of Chongqing, the political consciousness of the farmers in the suburbs has gradually increased through assisting the government in grain requisition, promoting public bonds, and opposing bandits and special agents. Many activists have emerged, forming many agricultural association groups. The establishment of the Municipal Agricultural Association Preparatory Committee will enable the peasant movement in the suburbs to unfold more vigorously.

    重庆市农协筹委会成立
    重庆市首次农民代表会议已于五月二十五日到二十八日举行，出席代表三百二十二人，代表该市郊区十四万五千农民。会议讨论了重庆市郊区的农村工作，决定建立市农民协会，进一步开展郊区的防匪反特斗争。会议并通过渝市郊区减租暂行条例草案，将提请市人民政府批准实施。最后，会议选出市农协筹委四十七人，成立了重庆市农民协会筹备委员会。重庆解放后，郊区农民经过协助政府进行征粮、推销公债以及反对土匪特务等项运动，政治觉悟已逐步提高，并涌现了不少积极分子，组成了许多农协小组，市农协筹委会成立后，将使郊区农民运动更有力地展开。
