　　Shanghai's Industry and Commerce See Partial Improvement
　　By our Special Correspondent, Lin Wei
　　Shanghai's industry and commerce, after reaching the peak of difficulties in mid-April, have begun to show partial improvement. However, the difficulties are still quite serious and have not been fundamentally overcome.

Partial Improvement

　　From the perspective of improvement, first, the market has become a bit more active. Merchants from Shenyang, Tianjin, Xi'an, Kunming, Changsha, and other places have begun to come to Shanghai to buy goods, and the number of Shanghai residents making purchases has also gradually increased. The sales of commodities such as rice, flour, cotton yarn, cotton fabrics, knitwear, and silk fabrics were all slightly better in May than in April. According to statistics from the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Bureau, the changes in the trading volume of various major commodities in the wholesale market in May compared to April are as follows: rice increased by slightly more than 17 percent, flour increased by slightly less than 37 percent, coal increased by slightly more than 16 percent, salt increased by slightly less than 27 percent, sugar increased by slightly more than 80 percent, cotton yarn increased by slightly more than 8 percent, and cotton cloth increased by slightly less than 696 percent. In the industrial sector, the cotton textile industry, which accounts for about half of Shanghai's industry, has seen more than 70 percent of its spindles in operation. Working hours generally reach 80 hours per week (normal hours should be 120 hours). Heavy industries such as steel and electrical machinery have almost all resumed operations. The number of paper mills in operation has increased from three to ten. The number of shirt factories in operation has increased from five to forty (all of them). Among more than 300 stationery factories, 200 have already started operation. Other industries such as dyeing and weaving, cotton weaving, silk weaving, knitting, underwear, enamelware, and rubber have either increased the number of operating factories or increased working hours, showing some signs of improvement. There are no longer major cases of dismissal disputes involving hundreds or even thousands of workers. There are only small cases involving a few or dozens of people. More than 500 of the more than 5,000 unemployed workers in the garment industry in the Hongkou District have been re-employed. The prices of imported industrial raw materials and some industrial products (such as paper scraps) like caustic soda, soda ash, raw rubber, sulfur, and tanning extract, which had fallen below cost due to lack of buyers, have seen adjusted increases, allowing operators to profit or reduce losses. In terms of exports, the pig bristle processing industry is now no longer losing money, and there has been a gradual increase in the purchase of raw materials from rural areas and in the number of factories in operation. Of the 143 businesses in this industry, less than one-tenth were in operation at the most difficult time; now, half are operating normally, and the other half are partially operating. In addition, the number of bank deposit and withdrawal accounts has increased, and business has become slightly more active.

　　The reasons for these phenomena are: first, the prices of basic consumer goods have turned from falling to stabilizing. The wait-and-see attitude of the general public in March and April has begun to change, and the consumer goods accumulated during the period of inflation have gradually decreased, and real purchasing power has begun to re-enter the market. Second, and more importantly, the state has provided appropriate loans, purchases, processing, and orders to alleviate the difficulties of industry and commerce. In terms of textile processing, according to the production plan and the numbers allocated to each factory at the East China Textile Conference in May, most factories will have work to do from now until the new cotton is on the market. The state orders received by steel and electrical machinery factories in April have also solved problems for four or five months, or even eight or nine months. Light industries other than cotton textiles have also seen capital flow due to the state trade organizations purchasing products from more than 500 larger factories in April and May.

Industries Beneficial to National Economy and People's Livelihood Have Bright Prospects

　　The fact that industries beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have changed from stagnation to slight activity is occurring on a different foundation than last winter, and therefore will have different development prospects. First, the state, after financial and economic unification, has been able to fully control basic materials and has sufficient strength to stabilize market prices. Therefore, the above-mentioned increase in market trading volume has not caused fluctuations in the prices of major commodities. From the beginning of May to June 12, the rise and fall of rice, flour, cotton, yarn, cloth, cooking oil, etc., was only 3 to 7 percent. This has reduced the gap for speculation and profiteering and allowed legitimate industry and commerce to operate freely. Second, the people's real purchasing power has begun to enter the market; after the liberation of Zhoushan, some commodities began to flow to Zhoushan, Ningbo, and other places, and the purchasing power of some farmers increased after the state purchased rural tea, silk, and local products; in addition, the summer harvest has arrived and the autumn harvest is not far away; this will gradually increase commodity sales. Therefore, those who are already profitable (such as department store manufacturing) can generally continue to maintain appropriate profits in the future; those who have already achieved no loss or less loss (such as general yarn mills) will generally not have major setbacks again and may gradually move towards profitability. Third, bank loan interest rates have gradually fallen from 40 to 50 percent to below 4 percent, about twice the pre-war level. This greatly reduces the financial burden on industrialists and merchants. Taking the cotton textile industry as an example, in the past, many factories bore high interest rates of 50 or 60 yuan per day, and even at the lowest, it was 30 yuan. Even at 30 yuan, purchasing cotton locally and a production process of five days, interest would account for 15 percent of the cost. According to the Textile Bureau, debt interest accounted for 60 percent of the losses incurred by various yarn mills since liberation. Now that this burden has been greatly reduced, factories can begin to focus on internal reforms and create favorable conditions for recovery and development. Fourth, although the progress of the current partial improvement is not large, it is a progress under the state's overall planning and focused adjustment and support. Generally, manufacturers have now seen the harm of blind production in the past and are willing to accept the state's unified distribution and guidance. Many factories and stores have taken the initiative to ask the government to guide their production and operation and to help them make plans. This will greatly reduce the phenomenon of blind production where production and sales are disjointed, and recovery and development will be smoother. Fifth, after repeated emphasis by the Central People's Government, especially after the conference of the Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the importance of adjusting public-private relations has become clearer in leadership organs and cadres at all levels. Now, in addition to adjusting taxes in accordance with the unified regulations of the central government and lowering coal prices and freight rates, Shanghai is further lowering shipping rates and electricity costs and increasing the difference between the wholesale and retail prices of certain major consumer goods by one to two times. Processing conditions and purchasing and ordering prices are also being adjusted to become more reasonable. All of these will play a role in the continued overcoming of the difficulties of industry and commerce.

　　In addition, labor-capital relations have generally improved, the threat of bombing after the liberation of Zhoushan has been lifted, and so on, all of which are new favorable conditions. All of this shows that the difficulties of Shanghai's industry and commerce are beginning to decline and alleviate from the peak, and there is a possibility of moving towards recovery and development.

Difficult Times Have Not Yet Passed

　　Although Shanghai's industry and commerce have the above-mentioned signs of improvement and favorable conditions, generally speaking, the difficult times have not yet passed. The degree of difficulty is still quite serious. For general consumer light industrial products, although business is slightly better than in March and April, as of mid-June, there are still very few buyers from various places coming to Shanghai. The abnormal phenomenon of "more production than consumption" still exists. The sales of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the main industrial products, are still lingering at a certain transaction level. If the market transaction volume in January of this year is taken as 100, then the transaction volume of cotton yarn in May is only 55; cotton cloth is only 22. Although the "price inversion" situation between various places and Shanghai has slightly improved, it still does not have the conditions for smooth sales. The prices of yarn and cloth in Wuhu, Yangzhou, Hangzhou, Xuzhou, and other places are barely on par with Shanghai, and some are still below Shanghai. Small and medium-sized cities are limited by the purchasing power of farmers and residents, and prices are difficult to increase; Shanghai is limited by costs, and prices are difficult to lower further. Therefore, transportation and sales are still difficult. Taking the current yarn price in Shanghai as an example, the public sector loses a lot of money for each piece of yarn sold, and it is natural that private yarn mills cannot demand higher processing fees, and there is not much profit to be gained. The transaction volume of food rice and oil, salt, coal, and sugar, in addition to yarn and cloth, does not exceed 57 percent of January, and some are still below 50 percent. This further shows that the current real purchasing power is still limited. At the same time, the increase in purchasing power after the summer harvest cannot be overestimated. Because now many farmers do not buy cloth and other industrial products after selling tea, silk, and other local products, but buy more grain. This is the result of years of famine and war caused by the reactionary rule of the Japanese puppets and Chiang Kai-shek. This poverty cannot be made up for all at once. The summer harvest in Jiaodong, Bohai, and other places is better than last year, but it is not as good as last year in central and southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui. Southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, and Zhejiang have a very small proportion of summer harvest, mainly autumn harvest. Some areas still have summer famine, and even sowing the autumn crop is difficult. Therefore, it will take a considerable period of time to improve the purchasing power of the vast number of farmers.

　　During this difficult period, the phenomenon of industrial and commercial shutdown has not stopped. The number of applications for industrial and commercial shutdowns in May increased compared to April. The number of factory applications was slightly less than 113 percent of April, and the number of store applications was slightly less than 209 percent of April. These included textile dyeing, daily necessities, hardware construction, chemical raw materials, transportation, and so on. According to surveys, a large number of these are smaller factories and stores that had already stopped work before May, and are now rushing to deregister due to the implementation of democratic tax assessment. However, the majority of them are indeed unable to maintain operations. Eighty-two percent of the factories that applied have been approved to shut down. The number of applications for shutdown decreased significantly in early June, and some requested to start work or change shutdown to suspension of work, but the number of applications for shutdown is still greater than the number of applications for starting work. Some of these should decline, and some should not decline.

　　Compared with April, the deposit amount of public and private banks increased a bit (10 to 20 percent) in May, but loans hardly increased. Private banks only increased by 1.95 percent. At the same time, the phenomenon of credit stagnation and contraction still exists.

How to Overcome Difficulties

　　How to continue to work hard to overcome difficulties? Government support is very important. But more important and more basic is the subjective efforts of the private industrial and commercial circles themselves, to be determined and find ways. Improving the management of enterprises, improving efficiency, saving expenses, and reducing costs are currently issues of paramount importance. Now the cotton textile processing fee has increased from 205 Shanghai real units per yarn to 224, the public sector suffers even greater losses, and many private yarn mills still do not have enough to cover expenses. But the costs of yarn mills in Shanghai are not the same. The spindles of the private Runde Yarn Mill are all over 50 or 60 years old, and they used to lose a lot of money; after labor and management worked together to save expenses and improve efficiency, they have now begun to reach the break-even point. After hard work and reform, Hongfeng Yarn Mill has reduced the cost of each yarn to 203 Shanghai real units and can obtain a surplus. This shows that costs can be greatly reduced with subjective efforts. Recently, the factories of the Shenxin system implemented joint operations, unified management, saved manpower and materials, and improved output and quality, and have also made some progress. They have put forward the slogan of "reducing the processing fee for each yarn to 205 real units."

　　Changing the business strategy, taking the initiative to adapt to the needs and purchasing power of the masses, and guiding the existing purchasing power into the market are also important issues in changing the current business situation. Many department stores such as Dasanyuan Restaurant, Ronghua Restaurant, Hengxin Nanhua Store, Daxin, and Huaxin in the Central Shanghai District have overcome difficulties and achieved balance or profitability under the above-mentioned policy. They resolutely reduced the prices of high-end consumer goods that they had sold in the past and sold ordinary daily necessities that had smaller profits but more buyers, or sold local products, and the turnover generally increased, and some even increased by five or six times.

　　To implement the above-mentioned transformation, both labor and management must work together. If labor works hard but capital is passive, business will be difficult to run well. In Shanghai, the workers of many factories and stores have automatically saved various expenses, improved efficiency, strengthened discipline, and even voluntarily reduced wages and salaries and returned to their hometowns in rotation, in order to encourage capital not to close factories and stores. If capital can also universally give up the nostalgia for the past "small investment, big profit," actively raise funds, change strategies, and strengthen management, they will inevitably get better results. Now some industrialists and merchants have transferred funds back from Hong Kong and other places, or transferred speculative commercial funds to industrial investment (according to incomplete statistics, about 5 billion yuan has now been transferred to industry), and used methods such as publicizing business conditions to enable both labor and management to actively reform together, so production has increased and business has improved. However, some industrialists and merchants are still passively complaining, doubting, or waiting for relief and support, which is unfavorable to both social economy and themselves and needs to be completely changed!

　　上海工商业在局部好转
    本报特派记者  林韦
    上海市的工商业，在四月中旬困难达到顶点之后，开始出现了局部的好转。但困难仍然相当严重地存在着，尚未根本被克服。
  局部的好转
    从好转的方面看，首先是市场比较活动了一点。沈阳、天津、西安、昆明、长沙等地开始有客商来沪买货，上海市民购买者亦渐增多。米、面、棉纱、棉织品、针织品、丝织品等商品的销路，五月份均较四月份略畅。据上海工商局统计，各类主要商品在批发市场中的成交数量，五月份与四月份比较的情形是：米增加百分之十七强，面增加百分之三十七弱，煤增加百分之十六强，盐增加百分之二十七弱，糖增加百分之八十强，棉纱增加百分之八强，棉布增加百分之六百九十六弱。工业方面，占上海工业比重约及一半的棉纺织业，可能开动的锭数已有百分之七十以上开动起来。开工时数一般达到每周八十小时（正常时数应为一百二十小时）。钢铁、电机等重工业几已全部开工。造纸厂开工的由三家增至十家。衬衫厂开工的由五家增至四十家（全部）。文具厂三百多家，有二百家已经开工。其他染织、棉织、丝织、针织、内衣、搪瓷、橡胶等业，有的增加了开工厂数，有的增加了开工时数，显现了一些起色。解雇纠纷中已经没有了涉及数百人以至千人以上职业问题的大案件。只有数人至数十人的小案件了。沪西区成衣业中五千多失业工人，有五百多人已复业。前些时因无人购买而使售价下落到成本以下的烧碱、纯碱，以及生橡胶、琉化元、拷胶等进口工业原料及部分工业产品（如纸头）的价格，已有调整性的回升，使经营者得到盈利或减少了亏蚀。出口方面的猪鬃整理工业，现因不再赔本，下乡采购原毛与开工的已逐渐增多。该业一百四十三家，最困难时开工的不及十分之一；现已有一半正常开工，另一半部分开工。此外，银行存放款进出户头增多，业务也略显活跃。
    出现这些现象的原因：第一，是基本消费品的价格由下落而转稳，一般市民三、四月份观望不买的心理开始改变，而且在通货膨胀时期积存的消费品逐渐减少，真实购买力开始重新进入市场。第二，更重要的，是国家为解除工商业的困难，进行了适当的贷款、收购、加工与订货。纺织方面的加工，按照五月份华东纺织会议所订的生产计划与各厂分配的数字，大部工厂从现在到新棉花上市时都有活可做。钢铁与电机业各厂四月份所接受的国家订货，也解决了四、五个月以至八、九个月的问题。棉纺织以外的轻工业，也由于国家贸易机关在四、五月份收购了五百多家较大工厂的产品，使资金转动了起来。
  有利国计民生的行业前途远大
    有利于国计民生的行业由停滞微显活跃，是发生在与去冬不同的基础之上，因而将有不同的发展前途。第一，国家经过财经统一，基本物资已能充分掌握，有足够的力量平稳市场物价。因之上述市场交易量的增加，并未引起主要商品价格的波动。从五月初至六月十二日，米、面、花、纱、布、食油等的涨落不过百分之三到百分之七。这就减少了投机倒把的空隙，并使正当工商业可以放手经营。第二，人民真实购买力开始进入市场；舟山解放后若干商品开始流向舟山、宁波等地，国家收购农村茶、丝、土产后部分农民购买力增加；加以夏收已到，秋收不远；这就使商品销路会逐渐增加。因而目前已经有盈利可得的（如百货制造等业），今后一般能继续保持适当利润；目前已做到不蚀本、少蚀本的（如一般纱厂），一般也不致再有大波折，而可能逐渐走向有盈利可得。第三，银行贷款利率从四、五十分逐步落至四分以下，约当战前水平的两倍。这就使工商业者财务负担大大减轻。以棉纺业为例，过去不少工厂担负过日拆五、六十元的高利，最低时也在三十元之谱。即以三十元计，就地购棉，生产过程五日，利息也在成本中占到百分之十五。据纺织局计算：债息的负担在解放以来各纱厂赔损数额中占百分之六十。现在这一负担大大减轻，各厂可以开始集中精力于内部改革，而给恢复发展创造了有利条件。第四，目前局部好转的进展虽然不大，但这是在国家统筹兼顾和有计划有重点地调整和扶植之下的进展。一般厂家现在已看到过去盲目生产的害处，愿意接受国家的统一分配与指导。有许多厂店则主动要求政府指导他们的生产和经营，以及帮助他们订计划。这就会使产销脱节的盲目生产现象大大减少，恢复和发展将更顺利。第五，经过中央人民政府一再强调指出，特别是工商局长会议之后，调整公私关系的重要性已在各级领导机关与干部中更加明确起来。现在上海除依照中央统一规定调整税收，降低煤价、运价之外，并进一步降低航运价与电费，加大某些主要消费品批发与零售价格的差额一倍至二倍。加工条件与收购、订货价格也调整得日趋合理。这些都将对工商业困难的继续克服起其一定作用。
    此外，劳资关系已一般改善，舟山解放后轰炸威胁已解除等等，都是新的有利条件。这一切，说明了上海工商业的困难正在从高峰开始下降、减轻，并有了走向恢复、发展的可能。
  困难时期仍未过去
    上海工商业虽然有上述一些好转的迹象与有利的条件，但总的说来，困难时期仍然没有过去。困难的程度仍然是相当严重的。一般消费性的轻工业产品，目前虽较三、四月份生意略好，但至六月中旬止，各地来沪购买者仍然寥寥无几。“生产多于消费”的畸形现象仍然存在。主要工业产品的棉纱棉布的销路，目前仍然逗留在一定的成交水平上。如果以今年一月份市场成交量为一百，那么五月份棉纱成交量不过五五；棉布不过二二。现在各地与上海价格的“倒挂”形势虽已稍有好转，但仍未具备畅销条件。芜湖、扬州、杭州、徐州等地的纱布价格，有的勉强与上海扯平，有的仍在上海以下。中小城市限于农民和市民的购买力，价格难以上提；上海则限于成本，价格很难再低。因之运销仍然是困难的。就现在上海的纱价而论，公家出售每件纱要赔很多钱，各纱厂自然是不能要求更高的工缴费，而能够得利的也就不多了。纱、布以外的食米与油、盐、煤、糖的成交量，也都不超过一月份的百分之五七，有的还在百分之五十以下。这又说明了现在真实购买力还是有限度的。同时，对夏收后购买力的增加，估计也还不能过高。因为现在有不少农民卖出茶、丝及其他土产后并不购买布匹等工业品，而更多的是购买粮食。这是在日伪蒋反动统治下连年灾荒与战争造成的贫困的结果。这种贫困并不是一下子就能补得起来的。胶东、渤海等地夏收较去年为好，但鲁中南与苏北、皖北都不比去年好。皖南、苏南与浙江，则夏收比重甚小，主要是秋收。有些地区仍有夏荒，连秋禾下种都是困难的。所以，广大农民的购买力的提高，还需一段相当长的时期。
    在这困难时期中，工商业的停歇现象也就尚未停止。五月份工商业申请停歇业的户数，比四月份还有增加。工厂申请数等于四月份百分之一一三弱，商店申请数等于四月份百分之二○九弱。其中包括纺织染、日用品、五金建筑、化工原料、交通运输等等。据调查，其中有很大数量是五月份前即已停工的较小厂店，现在因实行民主评税，故赶来注销。但其中确实不能维持的仍是多数。申请的工厂，已有百分之八十二批准停歇。六月上旬申请停歇业的大见减少，并有请求开工或改歇业为停工的，但申请停歇数仍较申请开工数为大。其中有些是应该衰落的，有些是不该衰落的。
    如以五月份与四月份相比，公私银行的存款金额是增加了一点（百分之十至二十），放款则几乎没有增加。私营行庄只增加百分之一·九五。同时，信用停滞萎缩的现象仍然存在。
  怎样克服困难
    怎样继续努力克服困难呢？政府的扶助是很重要的。但更重要、更基本的还是私营工商业界自己主观的努力，下决心，想办法。改善企业的经营管理，提高效率，节约开支，减低成本，是目前具有头等重要意义的问题。现在棉纺工缴费从每件纱二百零五个上海折实单位提高到二百二十四个，公家赔累更大了，而私营纱厂还有许多不够开支的。但同是上海的纱厂，成本并不一致。私营仁德纱厂的锭子年龄均在五、六十年以上，以前亏蚀很大；后经劳资协力节约开支，提高效率，现已开始达到保本。鸿丰纱厂经过努力改革，每件纱成本降到二百零三个上海折实单位，可以得到盈余。这就说明成本是可以用主观努力大大减低的。最近申新系各厂实行联合经营，统一管理，节省人力物力，提高产量质量，也有若干起色。他们已提出“将每件纱工缴降到二百零五个折实单位”的口号。
    改变营业方针，主动去适应大众的需要与购买力，导引现有的购买力投入市场，也是改变目前营业状况的重要问题。沪中区的大三元酒菜馆、荣华酒家、恒心南货店、大新、华新等许多百货公司，都是在上述方针下度过了困难，走上收支平衡或能够盈利。他们果断地把过去的高级消费商品抑价脱售，改售利润虽小而买者众多的普通日用品，或经售土产，营业额即普遍增加，有的并增高了五、六倍。
    实行上述转变，必须劳资双方共同努力。劳方努力而资方消极，营业也是难以办好的。在上海，已有许多厂店的职工自动节约各种开支，提高效率，加强纪律，甚至自动减薪减资、轮流还乡，争取资方不要关厂关店。如果资方也能普遍地丢掉对过去“一本万利”的留恋，积极主动地筹措资金，改变方针，加强经营管理，必然会得到更好的结果。现在有一些工商业家已经从香港等地调回资金，或将投机性的商业资金转向工业投资（据不完全统计，现已有五十亿元左右转入工业），并用公开营业状况等办法做到劳资双方共同积极改革，因而生产增加、营业好转了。但有些工商业家还在消极埋怨，怀疑或坐待救济扶持，则对社会经济和他们自己都是不利的，急须彻底转变！。
