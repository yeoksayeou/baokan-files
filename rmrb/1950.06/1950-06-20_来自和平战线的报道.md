　　Reports from the Peace Front
    The peace signature campaign that began in Poland on May 11th has now concluded victoriously. Out of the country's 23.8 million people, 18 million have signed, representing approximately four-fifths of the total population. During the signature campaign, the number of pro-peace committees across the country also increased from 22,000 to 80,000.
    Since the Italian National Peace Committee convened the "Rome Conference Against the Atomic Threat" at the end of May, launching a mass movement for peace signatures, over one million signatures have been collected in ten Italian cities in the past two weeks. Italian peace fighters are carrying out their work with great enthusiasm. According to the Italian Peace Committee, an elderly mother named Serra, aged 65, personally collected signatures from over 7,000 people.
    The Finnish Democratic Women's League recently held a mass women's rally in Helsinki to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Finnish democratic women's organization. The 100,000 democratic women who attended the rally unanimously and solemnly vowed to fight for peace, never to send their children, husbands, or brothers to war, and to tirelessly strive to consolidate the friendship between Finland and the Soviet Union.
    Representatives of the Pakistan Democratic Students Union held a meeting in Lahore and unanimously passed a resolution demanding international control of atomic weapons. The resolution called upon the people of all countries in the world to form a united front to oppose the imperialist warmongers.
