Migrant Workers on the Yi River Project Petition Chairman Mao, Thanking Him for His Concern

[This newspaper report] (reports that) this spring, during the Yi River guidance project in northern Jiangsu, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government dispatched an epidemic prevention team to northern Jiangsu to treat and prevent diseases for the migrant workers. When the team completed its mission and returned to Beijing, the migrant workers on the Yi River project wrote letters entrusting the epidemic prevention team to forward them to Chairman Mao, thanking the government for its concern. The following are excerpts from three letters from migrant workers in Huaiyin County:

The letter from the 30,000 migrant workers in Huaiyin County, Huaiyin District, stated:

"In the past, when the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupied our area, they destroyed the Five Rivers and Six Dams, which caused us serious disasters. Just when we were in difficulty, you used the wise method of 'work relief' to lead us in dredging the Yi River, which not only saved our lives but also permanently eliminated the threat of flooding. We will never forget your great kindness...

"You are also concerned about the health of all our migrant workers, fearing that we would get sick, and specially sent an epidemic prevention team from far away Beijing. They were not afraid of wind and rain, and worked from dawn till dusk, vaccinating us, killing lice, and treating our illnesses, protecting our health. This really makes us feel comfortable and happy...

"We can only, under your leadership, be determined to dredge the Yi River well, permanently eliminate the threat of flooding, and work hard to increase production, so as to create a new life of abundance..."

The letter from all cadres and migrant workers of the Wuji Brigade of the Huaiyin General Team stated:

"You led us in the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan and the three-to-four-year War of Liberation, defeating the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, eliminating feudal remnants, and freeing us from the shackles that had weighed on us for thousands of years. Now you are leading us to build a new China, first by dredging the Yi River in our northern Jiangsu, permanently eliminating the threat of flooding here, and transporting grain from Shandong, Henan, and North China to this place, using work relief in combination with disaster relief, so that millions of people in northern Jiangsu have survived the severe drought through the river dredging project. You are also concerned about our health and have sent an epidemic prevention team to prevent epidemics for us. We can only work hard to dig soil and ensure the completion of the task on schedule in order to repay your great kindness. We also present a red flower to express our respect for you..."

The letter to Chairman Mao from seven children (Zhu Huiquin, Han Ruzhen, Wang Yuzhen, Cao Zhanxia, Zhang Shu, Liu Baohua, Chen Suyun) from the Laobakou Central Elementary School Comfort Group in Liqing District, Huaiyin County, stated:

"You led us in dredging the river for disaster relief, and many disaster victims were saved. We elementary school students cannot personally wield shovels to guide the Yi River, so we organized a comfort group. When we met the comrades of the epidemic prevention team you sent, we were as happy as if we had seen you. We were very happy when we met, we danced the Democratic Youth Dance, sang songs, and shouted slogans. They also sang songs for us to listen to...

"Our Youth League and Children's Team saved money on candy and made eighty 'Model League Member' and 'Youth Pioneer' medals to give to model League members and youths who dredged the river. We also brought many silk banners and thousands of letters of condolence sent by all walks of life to comfort the migrant workers. We also sang, danced, and offered individual condolences. Liu Ersao of the Wuji Brigade, after our condolences, dug 9.3 cubic meters of soil in one day. The migrant workers of the Zhangji Brigade said: 'We guarantee to push twenty more carts of mud.' Now that the comrades of the epidemic prevention team have completed their work and gloriously returned to Beijing, our Youth League and Children's Team are especially asking the comrades of the epidemic prevention team to bring a letter to express our condolences to you. We wish you good health!"

　　导沂民工上书毛主席
    感谢对他们的关怀
    【本报讯】今春苏北导沂工程中，中央人民政府卫生部曾派遣防疫队赶赴苏北为民工们治病防疫。该队完成任务返京时，导沂民工纷纷写信托防疫队转呈毛主席，感谢政府对他们的关怀。现将淮阴县民工等三封信摘要如下：
    淮阴区淮阴县全体三万民工的信上说：
    “过去日寇、蒋匪盘踞我们的地方，破坏了五河六坝，因此造成了我们严重的灾难。正当我们困难之际，您用“以工代赈”的英明办法，领导我们扒通沂河，不但救活了我们的生命，而且永除水患。我们永远忘不了您的大恩。……
    “您又关心我们全体民工的身体健康，恐怕我们生病，从遥远的北京特地派来了防疫大队，他们不怕风雨，起早落黑，替我们种牛痘、灭虱子、看病，保护我们的身体健康。真叫我们舒心乐意。……
    “我们只有在您领导下，决心扒好沂河，永除水患，努力加强生产，才能创造出丰衣足食的新生活……”
    淮阴总队吴集大队全体干部民工的信上说：
    “您领导我们进行了八年抗战，三四年的解放战争，打垮了日寇和国民党反动派，肃清了封建残余，解除了几千年来压在我们身上的枷锁。现在您又领导我们建设新中国，首先在我们苏北扒沂河，永除我们这里的水患，并把山东、河南、华北的粮食调运到这里来，以工代赈，结合救灾，使我们苏北几百万人民在扒河工作中度过了严重灾荒。您又关心我们的身体健康，派防疫大队来替我们预防疫病。我们只有下劲挖土，保证如期完成任务，来报答您的大恩情。我们并献红花一朵，表示对您的敬意……”
    淮阴县立清江区老坝口中心小学校慰问团的七位小朋友（朱会琴、韩汝珍、王玉珍、曹占霞、张曙、刘宝华、陈素云）给毛主席的信上说：
    “您领导我们扒河救灾，很多灾民都得救了。我们小学生不能亲自拿锹导沂，我们就组织慰问团。我们遇到您派来的防疫大队同志，好像见到您一样欢喜。我们见了面非常高兴，我们跳民主青年舞，唱歌，呼口号。他们也唱歌给我们听。……
    “我们青年团和少儿队节省了糖果钱，制了八十个‘模范团员’和‘青年先锋’奖章，赠给扒河的模范团员和青年。我们又带了各界送的许多面锦旗和几千封慰问信，来慰问民工。我们又唱歌、跳舞、个别慰问。吴集大队刘二嫂，经过我们慰问后，一天就挖土九方三。张集大队民工说：‘保证多推二十车子泥。’现在防疫队同志工作完毕，光荣回京，我们青年团与少儿队，特请防疫队同志带信慰问您。祝您健康！”
