Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Should Strive for Transformation

　　Private industrial and commercial enterprises occupy an important position in New Democratic China. "Protecting national industry and commerce" is one of the three major economic programs of New Democracy stipulated by Comrade Mao Zedong in his famous speech "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" in December 1947. Article 30 of the Common Program stipulates: "The People's Government shall encourage the enthusiasm of private economic enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and shall assist their development."

　　However, today China's private industrial and commercial enterprises face three basic problems: first, the relationship with the national economy; second, the labor-capital relationship; and third, the transformation of the private industrial and commercial enterprises themselves. Only when these three aspects are reasonably resolved can China's private industrial and commercial enterprises have the possibility of existence and development in New China. Regarding the first two issues, the government has separately consulted with representatives of the industrial and commercial sectors and trade union organizations, determined the correct guidelines and methods, and is gradually implementing them. In addition to this, national industrialists and businessmen across the country must make great efforts in the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises themselves.

　　It must be admitted that China's industry and commerce have survived and developed for a long time under the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, so they innately carry a strong semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature, and in the nearly twelve years of inflation, they have even more prominently carried a high degree of speculative nature. The more industrialized and commercial cities are, the more obvious this characteristic is. Shanghai is the largest industrial and commercial center in China, and Shanghai's private industry and commerce have long been a typical example of semi-colonialism, semi-feudalism, and speculation.

　　The industry and commerce of old China basically served imperialism, the feudal class, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, rather than the peasant masses who accounted for more than 80% of China's population, nor the working people who made up the vast majority of the urban population. Therefore, consumer industries, especially high-end consumer industries, occupy a leading position in cities. Therefore, the industry and commerce of old China was disconnected from the broad masses of the people, and cities and villages were opposed to each other. This is an important feature of the old Chinese economy.

　　Another characteristic of old China's industry and commerce was its high degree of speculation, which was the result of long-term inflation. After twelve years of malignant inflation, industry and commerce were inseparable from speculative activities. In particular, the bureaucratic capital of the four major families was mixed with commercial capital and speculative capital, using privileges to obtain exorbitant profits, which further promoted the development of speculation. In this situation where producers often lost money, while speculators often made huge profits, it was difficult for legitimate industrialists and businessmen to seriously engage in production. In the past, during the heyday of speculation, some factories merely hung a signboard without ever starting work. Their purpose was to use the name of the factory to obtain official foreign exchange, hoard raw materials, and engage in speculation.

　　Because the survival of old China's industry and commerce mainly relied on speculation rather than production, the organization of production institutions was often not based on production needs, but on the feudal control of their affiliated enterprises. Therefore, the organizational structure of many industrial and commercial enterprises was very bloated and inefficient. Many large enterprises, despite being organized as "joint-stock companies," were actually owned by a certain family. Although the machines used in the factory were modern, its organization was feudal. Relatives and fellow villagers occupied various departments of the enterprise administration, and even within an enterprise, unity could not be achieved. This situation not only generally existed in bureaucratic capital enterprises, but also existed in large numbers in private industrial and commercial enterprises.

　　This unreasonable management situation should not and cannot continue to exist after the victory of the revolution. This unreasonable management must be transformed. In fact, due to the political and economic victory of the people's democratic system and the demise of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal system, and due to the end of inflation, this old private industry and commerce has been forced to reorganize. In the process of reorganization, some pain is bound to occur. On a national scale, this pain reached its peak in March and April of this year. However, this pain has generally not passed. Industrialists and businessmen should see this basic situation clearly, consciously carry out the work of reorganization to adapt to the new environment and new needs, and only in this way can the pain be reduced or shortened.

　　Some industrialists and businessmen, in the early days of liberation, still followed the old business path and continued to engage in speculative activities to varying degrees. However, after prices stabilized, the objective conditions for speculation were basically eliminated, exorbitant profits were impossible, and reasonable profits could only be obtained through reasonable management methods. Because many industrialists and businessmen were not prepared ideologically and actionally for this historic and fundamental change, they encountered temporary great difficulties.

　　The transformation of the management of private industrial and commercial enterprises is basically two issues: one is the issue of management policy, and the other is the issue of management methods.

　　Industry and commerce that used to serve imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism must be changed to face the countryside and face the people, so as to find a reliable and unlimited market. Last November, Tianjin held an industrial exhibition, inviting more than 1,000 farmers to visit and holding several forums for farmer representatives and industrialists. The farmers pointed out which industrial products met their needs and which did not. The industrialists in Tianjin discovered their broadest market from here, and from then on, they could produce with more planning. After this industrial exhibition, many factory owners believed that inviting farmer representatives to visit once and manufacturing goods according to the farmers' opinions would guarantee sales. For example, some department stores in Shanghai and Tianjin, which used to promote imported goods and luxury goods, are now selling domestic goods that meet the needs of the masses and adopting a policy of small profits and quick sales, and their business has begun to improve. Conversely, those who do not change their business policy will not be able to overcome the difficult situation for the old industry and commerce formed by the reasonable reorganization of the old social and economic structure.

　　Another aspect of the transformation of private enterprises is the issue of improving management methods.

　　Simplification and economy, reducing staffing, reducing production or business costs, and actively increasing capital are the ways for private enterprises to overcome current difficulties. Implementing simplification should first start with simplifying the bloated and corrupt institutions, first of all, dismiss those redundant personnel who only receive salaries and do nothing, and reduce the excessively generous salaries of those senior staff. If the industrialists and businessmen improve their management, and the general employees they employ are still too many, and production cannot be maintained without reducing employees, appropriate staff reduction and salary reduction can be allowed after proper consultation with the government's industrial and commercial departments, labor departments, and trade unions, and after a concrete relief method is determined for temporarily unemployed employees. We believe that as long as the capitalists deal with it fairly and reasonably and honestly discuss the difficult situation with the workers, the workers can understand. There are now many examples in cities across the country where employees voluntarily propose to reduce wages and tide over the current difficulties together. The problem is that the reduction must be fair and reasonable; if the redundant personnel enjoying high salaries are not simplified, but only the workers are simplified, then that is incorrect and unacceptable to the workers.

　　Another way to improve management is to implement joint operation. Joint operation has the following advantages: in terms of capital, it can accumulate small amounts into large amounts, which is convenient for use, and at the same time, it can improve credit and facilitate loans; in terms of purchasing raw materials, the quantity purchased is larger, which is easy to centrally purchase and allocate, and the price will not rise sharply due to panic buying, which can reduce intermediate exploitation, and transportation and storage costs can be saved somewhat. Moreover, due to joint procurement, the quality is easy to identify, and small and medium-sized factories will not suffer from piecemeal procurement. Some raw materials can also be exchanged with each other. In terms of production, joint operation can avoid blind competition, and everyone can jointly formulate a production and sales balance plan to rationally allocate output. For products that are complex and varied, work can be divided and cooperated to produce in large quantities. Production efficiency will be improved due to clear division of labor and mutual observation. The standards of products can be unified, which is convenient for inspection; it can be studied how to save labor and materials, and the cost can be gradually reduced. In terms of business, joint business can unify and adjust styles, adapt to the market, and penetrate into the countryside. Moreover, the output is concentrated, which makes it easy to undertake orders or entrusted processing tasks. The cost calculation of each joint venture factory is consistent, which can stabilize prices, maintain reasonable profits, and avoid mutual competition. Export goods are also easy to cooperate with state-owned trading institutions to promote sales. In addition, the contact between the manufacturers of the joint venture is closer, and education and transformation are easy to start. Since small and medium-sized industry and commerce are centralized from decentralized, it is also convenient for the leadership of state-owned enterprises.

　　In order to achieve the success of joint operation, each unit participating in the joint operation must be completely voluntary and cannot be forced. After the joint operation, state-owned enterprises should provide leadership, but the production and sales issues should basically rely on the efforts of the private manufacturers themselves, and cannot rely on the government. In addition, the joint operation organization itself must be sound; contracts should be detailed, consultations should be held in case of events, things should be done seriously, and continuous improvements should be made, so that the joint operation can develop.

　　The transformation of private enterprises is an arduous task, and it should be carried out resolutely and step by step. Before the completion of the land reform in the new area, the purchasing power of the countryside cannot be significantly improved, and private industry and commerce cannot have great development. At the same time, due to various objective limitations, turning industry and commerce that used to serve a few people into industry and commerce that serve the masses of the people, as well as improving management methods, still have some objective difficulties, which need to be overcome by enterprising national industrialists and businessmen. However, the future is bright, and patriotic private industrialists and businessmen should, under the leadership of the People's Government, fight together with the People's Government and the working class.

### 私营工商业应当力求改造

　　私营工商业应当力求改造
    私营工商业在新民主主义的中国是有重要地位的。“保护民族工商业”，这是毛泽东同志在一九四七年十二月的著名讲演“目前形势和我们的任务”中所规定的新民主主义的三大经济纲领之一。共同纲领第三十条规定：“凡有利于国计民生的私营经济事业，人民政府应鼓励其经营的积极性，并扶助其发展。”
    但是，今天中国的私营工商业面对着三个基本问题：第一，是与国家经济的关系问题；第二，是劳资关系问题；第三，是私营工商业自身的改造问题。只有这三方面的问题都合理解决了，中国私营工商业才有在新中国存在和发展的可能。关于前两个问题，政府已分别与工商界代表和工会组织协商，定出了正确的方针和办法，并正在逐步实施。除此以外，全国民族工商业家还须作巨大努力的工作，是私营工商业本身的改造。
    必须承认：我国的工商业是长期在帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的统治下生存与发展起来的，所以它先天地带着浓厚的半殖民地性与半封建性，在近十二年的通货膨胀中又比以前更加突出地带着高度的投机性。愈是工商业集中的都市，这种特征愈表现得明显。上海是中国最大的一个工商业中心，上海的私营工商业在长期间也是半殖民地性、半封建性、投机性的典型。
    旧中国的工商业基本上是为帝国主义、封建阶级和官僚资产阶级服务的，而不是为占中国人口百分之八十以上的农民大众服务的，也不是为都市人口的最大多数的劳动人民服务的。因此，消费性的行业，尤其是高级消费性的行业，在城市中占领导地位。因此，旧中国的工商业与广大人民是脱节的，城市和乡村是对立的。这正是旧中国经济的一个重要特征。
    旧中国工商业的另一个特征是它高度的投机性，这是长期通货膨胀的结果。经过了十二年的恶性通货膨胀，工商业与投机活动是分不开的。尤其是四大家族的官僚资本与商业资本、投机资本混为一体，利用特权来取得暴利，更促进了投机的发展。在这种生产者常要赔本，而投机者常得暴利的情况下，正当的工商业家很难认真经营生产事业。在过去投机盛行时期，有些厂仅仅挂一块招牌，根本不要开工，他的目的就是假工厂之名，取得官价外汇，囤积原料，进行投机。
    由于旧中国的工商业的生存主要靠投机而不是靠生产，所以对于生产机构的组织，常常不从生产需要着眼，而是从对其所属企业的封建性的控制着眼。因此，许多工商业的组织机构十分臃肿庞大，而工作效率很低。许多大企业尽管是“股份有限公司”的组织，实际上往往是某一家族所有；尽管工厂所用的机器是新式的，但他的组织却是封建的。亲戚同乡，盘据企业行政的各部，甚至在一个企业内部也不能统一。这种情形，不仅一般地存在于官僚资本的企业中，而且也大量地存在于私营工商业中。
    这种不合理的经营情况，在革命胜利之后，是不应该也不可能继续存在的。必须对于这种不合理的经营进行改造。事实上，由于人民民主制度在政治上和经济上的胜利和半殖民地半封建制度的灭亡，由于通货膨胀的终结，这种旧的私营工商业也已被迫地在进行改组了。在改组过程中，不能不发生一些痛苦。就全国范围说，这个痛苦，在今年三、四月达到了最高峰。但是，这种痛苦一般地还未过去。工商业家应当看清楚这种基本形势，自觉地进行适应于新环境新需要的改组的工作，只有这样，才能使痛苦减轻或缩短。
    有些工商业家在解放初期，曾仍旧沿着旧日的经营道路办事，继续进行不同程度的投机活动。但是，在物价稳定以后，投机取巧的客观条件基本上消灭了，暴利不可能存在了，而合理的利润就只有用合理的经营方式才能得到。由于许多工商业家对于这一个历史性根本性的重大变化，在思想上和行动上没有作准备，因而遇到了暂时的很大的困难。
    改造私营工商业的经营，基本上是两个问题：一是经营方针问题，一是经营方法问题。
    过去为帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义服务的工商业，必须改变为面向农村，面向人民，这样才能找到可靠的而且是不可限量的市场。去年十一月天津举行工业展览会，邀请了一千多个农民来参观，并开了好几次农民代表与工业家的座谈会。农民们指出那些工业品合于他们的需要，那些不合于他们的需要。天津的工业家们就从这里发现了他们最宽广的市场，而且从此可以比较有计划的生产。在这次工展以后，许多工厂主都认为，请农民代表参观一次，根据农民意见制造商品，销路就有保证。又如上海与天津有些百货公司，在过去都是推销舶来品及奢侈品的，现在改售适合于大众需要的国货，并采薄利多销的方针，它们的营业都开始好转。反之，凡是不改变营业方针的，就无法度过由于旧社会经济结构合理改组而形成的对旧工商业来说是困难的局面。
    改造私营企业的另一方面的问题，是改善经营方法的问题。
    精简节约，裁汰冗员，减轻生产或营业成本，积极增加资金，是私营企业克服当前困难的方法之一。实行精简应首先从臃肿腐败的机构精简起，首先应裁撤那些光拿薪水不管事的冗员，减低那些高级职员的过分优厚的薪金。如果工商业家改善了经营之后，其所雇的一般职工仍然过多，非减裁职工不能维持生产时，在与政府工商部门、劳动部门及工会共同妥善协商、对暂时失业员工定出确实救济办法以后，适当的裁员减薪是可以允许的。我们相信，只要资方确实处理得公平合理，把困难情形老老实实地和工人商量，工人是可以谅解的。现在全国各城市中已有许多由职工自动提议减低工资，共度目前难关的实例。问题是裁减一定要公平合理；如果对坐享高薪的冗员不精简，而只从工人方面精简，那就是不正确的，也就是不能为工人所接受的了。
    改善经营的另一个方法，是实行联合经营。联合经营有下列的好处：在资金方面，可以积少成多，便于运用，同时可以提高信用，便于贷款；在购买原料方面，购买的数量较大，易于统购统配，价格不致因抢购而暴涨，可以减少中间剥削，运输保管费用可以节省一些。且因联合采购，品质易于鉴定，中小厂不致因零星采购吃亏。有些原料，亦可彼此互通有无。在生产方面，联营可以避免盲目的竞争，大家可以共同制定产销平衡计划，合理地分配产量。对于产品复杂，种类繁多者，可以分工合作，大量生产。生产效率，将因分工明确，相互观摩而提高。产品的标准，可以求得统一，便于检查；工料可以研究如何节省，成本亦可因此逐渐减低。在营业方面，联合营业，可以统一调剂式样，适应市场，深入农村。而且产量集中，易于承接定货或委托加工的任务，联营各厂成本计算一致，可以稳定价格，保持合理利润，避免彼此竞销。外销货品，亦易与国营贸易机构配合，推广销路。此外，联营的厂商，同业间彼此的联系趋于密切，教育与改造易于着手。由于中小工商业从分散到集中，亦便利于国营企业的领导。
    为了求得联营的成功，参加联营的各单位必须完全自愿，不能勉强。在联营之后，国营企业应予领导，但产销问题基本上仍应依靠各私营厂商自己的力量来解决，不能倚赖政府。此外，联营机构本身必须健全；应当详订合同，遇事协商，认真办事，不断改进，这样才能使联营事业发展起来。
    私营企业的改造是一个繁重的工作，应当坚决地有步骤地去进行。在新区土地改革未完成以前，农村购买力还不可能有显著的提高，私营工商业还不可能有大的发展。同时由于种种客观条件的限制，要把过去为少数人服务的工商业转变为人民大众服务的工商业，以及改善经营方法，都还存在着若干客观的困难，有待于有进取心的民族工商业家的努力克服。但是，前途是光明的，爱国的私营工商业家应当在人民政府领导下，与人民政府和工人阶级共同奋斗。
