　　Surveying the Qaidam Basin in Preparation for Reclamation: Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Department Dispatches Survey Team
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Qaidam Basin survey team dispatched by the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Department of Agriculture and Forestry arrived in Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, on May 23rd. The team includes a number of specialized technical personnel in industry, agriculture, meteorology, animal husbandry, and water conservancy. They will cooperate with relevant departments and troops in Qinghai to conduct key surveys in the Xiarika and Chahanwusu areas along the Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway, in preparation for future reclamation. The total cultivated land in Qinghai Province is 7,800,700 mu, accounting for only six-thousandths of the total land area. It is estimated that there are still more than 64,190,000 mu of arable wasteland in the province, most of which is concentrated in the Qaidam Basin. According to preliminary studies, the Qaidam Basin's climate, rainfall, water conservancy, terrain, and other natural conditions are suitable for cultivation. If developed, it will become an excellent agricultural area. The survey team is currently collecting various data in Xining and will soon depart. The team's work is scheduled to last for five months.

　　勘察柴达木盆地准备开垦  西北农林部派出勘察队
    【本报讯】据新华社消息：西北军政委员会农林部派出的柴达木盆地勘察队已于五月二十三日抵达青海省会西宁市。该队包括工业、农业、气象、畜牧及水利等专门技术人员多人，将配合青海各有关部门和部队，到青（海）新（疆）公路的夏日卡及察汗乌苏一带进行重点勘察，准备将来开垦。青海全省已垦耕地为七百八十万零七千亩，仅占土地总面积的千分之六。据估计，全省尚有可耕荒地六千四百十九万余亩，其中大部集中在柴达木盆地。据初步研究，柴达木盆地的气候、雨量、水利、地形等自然条件均适于耕作，如加以开发，将成为极好的农业区。勘察队刻正在西宁搜集各项资料，即将启程前往。该队工作时间预定为五个月。
