To the Editor:

    I am from Xipo Village, First District, Lingshou County, Hebei Province, and currently work at the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau. After my parents passed away, I inherited four mu of land. During the land reform in the winter of 1947, the poor peasant association said I should be allocated land at my husband's home, and consequently, all my land was confiscated. I was dissatisfied with this and appealed to the Lingshou County People's Government. At that time, Sun Huating, the chief of the Civil Affairs Section, replied that my inheritance right was still valid. He wrote a letter asking the First District to handle it. However, I inquired with the District Government many times, but there were no results. Later, I appealed to the County Government. Because Comrade Sun Huating had been transferred, there were still no results. In the first month of 1949, I went to the First District again to urge them to deal with it. Comrade Zhang Lanchi of the District Committee said, "You are currently in training. We will resolve it after you return." Later, after my training period ended, the district again procrastinated, saying they needed to discuss it further before replying. In March, I came to work in the Fifteenth District of Beijing. Feeling that I had nowhere to appeal, I sent a letter to your newspaper, requesting you to forward it to the Lingshou County Committee for handling based on the actual situation. Later, the County Committee replied to your newspaper, saying that my husband's family was well-to-do middle peasants and my family was middle peasants. In reality, my husband's family is poor peasants. I wrote to your newspaper again, and you forwarded the materials to the Lingshou County Committee, asking them to consider handling it. Last year, I sent letters to the County Committee, County Government, District Committee, District Government, Xipo Village Government, and Village Branch, but received no response.

    In January of this year, I was in labor. The village chief of Xipo Village came to Beijing to visit his daughter and personally found my husband and me, saying that the land had been discussed by district cadres and all the villagers, and they agreed to return it to me. He also said, "You should enjoy the right of inheritance. Your land will be managed by you in the future. If it is left uncultivated, the village cadres will not be responsible!" Unexpectedly, after the village chief returned, things changed again. My brother wrote to me saying, "The village cadres have taken back your land certificate and the land." At that time, I did not understand the reason for taking back the land certificate and the land, so I wrote a report asking my bureau chief for instructions. After the bureau chief understood the situation, he wrote an official letter to the Lingshou County Government, the First District Government, and the Xipo Village Government in March, asking them to inform him of the process of handling this matter, but he has not received a reply to this day.

    How should my matter be handled? The Lingshou County Committee and County Government should give me an appropriate response. If the right of inheritance should not belong to me, I will definitely abide by the policy; if it should belong to me, but it is delayed further, what kind of work style is this? I hope the Lingshou County Committee and County Government will help me solve this problem as soon as possible.

    Editor's Note: Hou Yongxiu's inheritance of her parents' four mu of land is legitimate. According to the situation reflected in Hou Yongxiu's letter, it was wrong to confiscate her land during the land reform. Since the local government has repeatedly acknowledged her right of inheritance, why has it been delayed for so long without being addressed? It is hoped that the Lingshou County Government and County Committee will help her investigate this matter and instruct the First District Government and Xipo Village Government to publicly respond in the newspaper.

　　侯永秀的土地继承权灵寿县府应予维护编辑同志：
    我是河北省灵寿县第一区西坡村人，现在北京市卫生工程局工作。我父母去世后，我继承了四亩土地。在一九四七年冬，该村进行土地改革，贫农团说我应到婆家分地，遂将我的土地全部收去。我对此事不满意，曾向灵寿县人民政府申诉。当时民政科长孙华亭同志答复：我的继承权仍有效。他写信请一区处理。但是我询问区政府多次，都没有结果。后又到县政府申诉。因为孙华亭同志已调动工作，亦未得结果。一九四九年正月，我又到一区去催问，区委张兰池同志说：“你现在受训期间，等你回来再解决。”后来我受训期满，区里又推托要讨论后再作答复。三月间我来京十五区工作。我感到无处申诉，曾写了一份材料寄到贵社，要求转请灵寿县委根据实际情形予以处理。后来县委曾给贵社复过一信，说我婆家是富裕中农，娘家是中农。实际上我婆家是贫农。我又曾写信给贵社，由你们将材料转给灵寿县委，请其考虑处理。去年我给县委、县府、区委、区政府、西坡村政府、村支部的信，都未得到回音。
    今年一月，我正在分娩期间。西坡村长来京看他的女儿，曾亲自找到我夫妇二人，说土地已由区干部及全村农民讨论，同意归还我。他并说：“你应享受继承权。你们的土地今后由你们经营，如荒了，村干不负责任！”不料村长返里后，又发生了变化。我兄来信说：“村干部又将我的土地证和土地收回。”当时我不明白收回土地证和土地的理由，就写了一份材料请示我局局长。经局长了解后，曾在三月间写了一封公函给灵寿县府、第一区政府、西坡村政府，请他们将处理此事的经过来函告知，但至今未获回音。
    我的事情究应如何处理，灵寿县委、县府应给我一个适当的答复。如果继承权不应归我，我一定遵守政策；如果应该归我，而又拖延下去，试问这是一种什么作风？我希望灵寿县委与县府早早帮我解决这个问题。

    编者按：侯永秀继承父母的四亩土地是合法的。根据侯永秀来信所反映的情况，土地改革时没收她这份土地是不对的。当地政府既已一再承认她的继承权，为什么又拖得很久，不加以处理呢？希望灵寿县政府和县委帮助她查问此事，并责成一区区政府和西坡村政府在报纸上公开答复。
