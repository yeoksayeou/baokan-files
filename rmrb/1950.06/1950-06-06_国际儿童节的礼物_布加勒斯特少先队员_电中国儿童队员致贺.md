[Reported by this newspaper] According to the China Youth News Agency: On the occasion of International Children's Day on June 1st, the Young Pioneers of Bucharest, the capital of the Romanian People's Republic, sent a telegram to the Department of Young Pioneers and Children of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China, extending congratulations to the members of the Chinese Young Pioneers. The telegram reads as follows: Dear Young Pioneers of the People's Republic of China:

We, the Young Pioneers of the Romanian People's Republic, on this day commemorating International Children's Day, send our joyful congratulations to you, the Young Pioneers of the People's Republic of China, from afar! On this day, in our capital Bucharest, the Young Pioneers received a grand gift from the Romanian Workers' Party – a Youth Palace.

We know that your great country and hundreds of millions of people have been liberated from the barbaric enslavement of the imperialists for many years. We also know that in your country, people who have lived in poverty and suffering for many years have seen the prospect of their increasingly beautiful lives. We congratulate you. Thanks to the struggle of the heroic people's ranks under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, and thanks to the help of the great Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin, who once liberated us, your country is moving towards the bright and splendid road of socialist construction.

Here in the Romanian People's Republic, the Party has opened up a happy and joyful life for us. We are living under the sunshine of the Party's care and love. In order to respond to the care and hope that our Party has placed in us, we are doing everything possible to study and train ourselves to become useful citizens of the motherland and reliable soldiers in the great ranks of defending peace and building socialism.

Dear Chinese Young Pioneers, we wish you progress in your studies and once again extend our joyful congratulations to you!

The Young Pioneers of Bucharest, the capital of Romania
