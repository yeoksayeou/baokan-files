Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 14th—To convey the peaceful reunification plan to representatives of political parties, social organizations, and democratic figures in South Korea, the Korean Democratic Fatherland Front dispatched representatives, including Li Yin-kui, to Liyuan Station on the “38th parallel” on the 10th, to await representatives from various South Korean democratic parties and groups. However, the South Korean representatives were unable to reach the station due to obstruction by the South Korean puppet government. When the three representatives arrived at Liyuan Station, the station was subjected to concentrated firing from carbines, rifles, light and heavy machine guns, and automatic cannons from the area south of the 38th parallel. The shelling lasted from 2:00 PM to 5:20 PM on the 10th before it stopped. Due to the South Korean authorities' unreasonable obstruction of representatives from various South Korean democratic parties and groups from arriving at the designated location to receive the "Appeal to the People" from the Korean Fatherland Front, the Secretariat of the Korean Fatherland Front instructed the three representatives, Li Yin-kui, Jin Tai-hong, and Jin Zai-chang, to cross the Liyuan Station at 10:00 AM on June 11th and proceed to Seoul to deliver the "Appeal to the People" from the Korean Fatherland Front to representatives of various South Korean democratic parties. As soon as the three of them crossed the "38th parallel" for about one kilometer, they were arrested by the South Korean police. According to Seoul Radio on the evening of the 11th, Li Cheng-gen, Director of the puppet Government Administration Bureau, announced that the three representatives of the Fatherland Front would be "handed over to a military tribunal for trial." In response, the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front issued a communique on the 12th stating that the Syngman Rhee gang's illegal arrest and detention of representatives of the Fatherland Front and their persecution have aroused indignation and further hatred among the entire Korean people. The Korean people will vigorously launch a campaign to rescue the representatives of the Fatherland Front and will never allow the Syngman Rhee gang's attempt to provoke a civil war and undermine national peaceful reunification under the direction of American imperialism to succeed.
　　
At the same time, the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front sent a copy of the "Appeal to the People of the Whole Country," issued on the 10th to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea, to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie.

　　李承晚匪帮非法拘捕祖国战线代表
    全朝人民表示愤慨与憎恨
    大力展开营救被捕代表运动
    【新华社平壤十四日电】朝鲜祖国民主主义战线为向南朝鲜各政党、社会团体代表及民主人士传达和平统一方案，特于十日派遣代表李寅奎等三人赴，“三八线”上的砺砚站，等候南朝鲜各民主党团及民主人士的代表，但南朝鲜代表因遭到南朝鲜傀儡政府的阻挡，无法到达该地。当三位代表到达砺砚站时，该站曾遭到北纬三十八度以南地区的卡宾枪、步枪、轻重机枪等的集中射击以及自动炮的轰击。炮火从十日下午二时延至下午五时二十分始停。由于南朝鲜当局无理阻止南朝鲜各民主党团的代表抵达指定地点接受朝鲜祖国战线的告人民书，朝鲜祖国战线书记局乃指令李寅奎、金泰弘和金在昌三代表于六月十一日上午十时通过砺砚站，前往汉城，向南朝鲜各民主党派的代表递交朝鲜祖国战线的告人民书。他们三人甫越过“三八线”约一公里，即遭南朝鲜警察逮捕。据十一日晚汉城广播，伪政训局长李成根宣称祖国战线的三个代表将被“移交军法会议裁判”。祖国战线中央委员会书记局为此特于十二日发表公报称：李承晚匪帮非法逮捕拘押祖国战线代表并加以迫害的暴行，已激起全朝鲜人民的愤慨与进一步的憎恨。朝鲜人民将大力展开营救祖国战线代表的运动，绝不容许李承晚匪帮在美帝国主义的指使下，挑拨内战破坏国家和平统一的企图得逞。
    同时，祖国战线中央委员会已于十日将为促进朝鲜和平统一而发表的告全国人民书一份，致送联合国秘书长赖伊。
