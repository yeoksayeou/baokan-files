　　The Handan Public Security Section of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Armed to Help Farmers with Wheat Harvesting
    During the wheat ripening season, the Handan Public Security Section of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, in order to prevent sabotage by bandits and protect the fruits of the laboring people, mobilized public security personnel (including 433 people from the Public Security Section, Xinxiang Public Security Section, and Handan Public Security Section) in late May to help farmers with wheat harvesting. They helped harvest more than 1,600 mu of wheat fields. During the assistance, all units paid special attention to protecting the farmers' farm tools, ensuring that none were damaged. Some units even refrained from drinking the villagers' boiled water. Many comrades became ill from exhaustion during the intense harvesting but refused to rest. Wang Jinhe, a comrade from the Xinxiang Public Security Section, helped with the harvest while ill and harvested eight rows of wheat while others harvested only six.
    The local farmers were extremely happy to receive the assistance of the public security personnel during the wheat harvest. Liu Jinsheng, an old man in his sixties from Xinxiang, said, "In the past, the Kuomintang army only beat and scolded the common people and robbed their grain. Now, the army is helping us with the wheat harvest. Only the people's army can do this." An old woman from Niucun said to the public security personnel, "You are harvesting wheat for us in such hot weather. How can we repay you? Let us kill a chicken from our farm for you to eat!" But the public security personnel politely declined. A teacher from Qianhai Village said, "This is the first time I have seen such good public security personnel. This is the result of the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." To express their gratitude to the public security personnel, the local masses presented them with two silk banners.

　　郑州铁路局邯郸公安科  武装帮助农民麦收
    郑州铁路局邯郸公安科，在麦子成熟的时候，为了防止匪特破坏，保护劳动人民的劳动成果，于五月下旬发动公安人员（包括公安科、新乡公安段及邯郸公安段共四百三十三人）武装帮助农民麦收，共助收麦田一千六百余亩。各单位在助收当中，特别注意爱护农民的农具，使农具没有一件受到损坏。有的单位连开水也不喝老乡的。许多同志在紧张的助收中累病了，也不肯休息。新乡公安段的王金和同志，带病助收，并且在割麦中，别人才割完六趟，他就割完了八趟。
    当地农民在麦收中得到了公安人员的帮助，异常高兴。新乡一位六十多岁的老大爷刘金生说：“过去国民党的军队只会打骂老百姓，见到老百姓的粮食就抢。现在的军队帮助我们麦收，只有人民的军队，才能做得到。”牛村一位老大娘对公安人员说：“这么热的天给俺们割麦子，叫俺们怎样报答你们呢？把俺家喂的鸡杀给你们吃吧！”但被公安人员婉言谢绝了。前海村一位教员说：“我第一次看见这样好的公安员。这都是毛主席、共产党领导的结果。”当地群众为了表示对公安人员的感激，赠送他们两面锦旗。
