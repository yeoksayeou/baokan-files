　　The Northwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army is preparing to establish a quick-course middle school for troops. The preparatory committee of the school has drafted an education plan. The plan stipulates that the purpose of the quick-course middle school is to systematically improve the cultural level of troop cadres and outstanding soldiers who have undergone combat and work tests, so that they can quickly obtain secondary education and basic scientific knowledge, in order to further cultivate them into talents for various nation-building and army-building endeavors. Soldiers with more than five years of fighting experience in the army and army organs (including guards, communicators, and squad leaders), as well as combat heroes and model workers; platoon, company, and battalion-level cadres; Communist Party members with two or more years of party membership and with promising prospects in military or political affairs; those aged between sixteen and twenty-eight, with a higher primary or lower primary education level, and in good health, male or female, may be recommended to the quick-course middle school, and admitted after passing a test. In addition, troop cadres over the age of twenty-eight who have worked in the revolution for more than five years, even if they are physically weaker or have disabilities (except for those with chronic diseases or other infectious diseases), may also be recommended if they are willing to study, and admitted after review and approval.

　　The quick-course middle school is divided into a preparatory course and an undergraduate course. The main courses are Chinese language and mathematics (including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry), followed by physics, chemistry, nature (including zoology, botany, mineralogy, and meteorology), physiology and hygiene, history (including a brief history of social development, Chinese history, and modern Chinese history), and Chinese and foreign geography. The preparatory course lasts one and a half years, divided into three semesters; the undergraduate course lasts two years, divided into four semesters. Classes are held for twenty-four to twenty-six hours per week.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd: According to the instructions of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the Education Department of the East China Military and Political Committee will pilot three worker-peasant quick-course middle schools this year. One will be established in Southern Jiangsu, one in Shandong, and the other will be directly led by the Education Department of the Military and Political Committee and attached to the East China People's Revolutionary University.

　　The Southern Jiangsu Worker-Peasant Quick-Course Middle School has already started in early April. Most of the students are selected and transferred from various agencies, troops, and trade unions after passing examinations. The selection criteria are: Party, government, military, and mass organization workers who have participated in revolutionary struggles for more than three years, are aged between sixteen and thirty, have an education equivalent to higher primary school graduation, are ideologically progressive, are in good health, and are active in their work; or outstanding workers with more than three years of work experience, aged between sixteen and twenty-eight, with an education equivalent to higher primary school graduation, are ideologically progressive, are in good health, and are active in their work, with priority given to industrial workers. The worker-peasant quick-course middle school attached to the East China People's Revolutionary University is scheduled to open at the end of August or the beginning of September, and the students will be selected from Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhejiang, Northern Anhui, Southern Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu, totaling two hundred people. The Shandong Worker-Peasant Quick-Course Middle School is currently under active preparation.

　　The Worker-Peasant Quick-Course Middle School established by Chahar Province has been formally established, with a total of seventy-seven students, most of whom are worker and peasant cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than three years. Classes are taught in two groups. The current courses mainly focus on Chinese language, mathematics, history, and geography, and teaching is conducted through a combination of classroom lectures and self-study guidance.
