Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 4th: London dispatch: Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the China Peace Committee and member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, delivered a speech at a mass meeting in London on June 1st, convened to oppose war and defend peace. The full text of the speech is as follows:

　　Dear friends! In the name of the various peace organizations of China, I extend warm greetings to the British people who are bravely fighting for peace and democracy. I am the first Chinese person to come to London with a passport from our People's Republic, and I am extremely happy to be able to meet our British friends. The enemies of peace are strengthening the exploitation of their own people at home and intensifying the enslavement of oppressed nations in order to realize their war plans. For this reason, defending world peace has become our inevitable task.

　　We Chinese people are peace-loving people. The century-long rule of imperialism and feudalism in our country has forced us to stand up and wage a long and arduous struggle against the oppressors. Now, we have achieved a historically significant victory. Now, the Chinese people have basically won the conditions for national independence, people's democracy, and peaceful construction. In order to defend peace in the Far East and the world, and to prevent the revival of Japanese imperialism and any other acts of aggression by Japan or any other imperialist country, we have signed a treaty with our great ally, the Soviet Union, the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The combined strength of the 700 million people of these two great countries will certainly play an important role in the struggle for peace.

　　I came from Beijing, passing through the Soviet Union and the European People's Democratic countries. I have personally seen how the people of these countries are dedicating themselves to the construction of a peaceful, free and happy life, how strong their hopes for peace are, and how strong their hatred for war is.

　　Today, the forces supporting peace are growing rapidly, and the people of the world are taking active steps to oppose war. I salute the people of socialist countries and people's democratic countries: they are doubling their efforts in economic construction, thereby strengthening the bulwark of peace. I salute the working people of capitalist countries: they are waging a hard struggle against war preparations, refusing to load and unload war materials or engage in war production, and resolutely fighting to improve their conditions. I salute the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries: they are valiantly fighting for national independence, people's democracy and world peace.

　　In just two months, the Stockholm Appeal calling for the banning of atomic weapons has received an astonishing response from people of different political beliefs and social strata around the world. This is convincing evidence of how strong the people's desire for peace is. The situation is very clear, only a few warmongers and their lackeys advocate war, while the vast majority of people around the world advocate peace.

　　The struggle for peace is a just cause, and our strength is great. Let us use all the methods we can use to strengthen our fight! Let us bring millions more people into our ranks! We must expose all the lies of the warmongers so that they cannot use them to deceive their people and lead these people into war. Always remember that in the struggle for peace, the people of the whole world are standing with us. Fight with confidence, we will defeat the warmongers all over the world, smash their evil plans, and win lasting peace for the world. Imperialists and warmongers are digging their own graves; Hitler's shameful end is their future fate.

　　刘宁一在伦敦群众大会上演说
    号召和平拥护者加强战斗
    并代表我国和平团体向英国人民致敬
    【新华社布拉格四日电】伦敦航讯：中国保卫世界和平大会委员会副主席、世界拥护和平大会常设委员会委员刘宁一，六月一日在伦敦为反对战争，保卫和平而召集的群众大会上发表演说。演说全文如下：
    亲爱的朋友们！我以中国各和平团体的名义，向为和平与民主而英勇战斗的英国人民致热烈的敬礼。我是带着我们人民共和国的护照来到伦敦的第一个中国人，而且能够遇见我们的英国朋友，我感到极为高兴。和平的敌人们正在加强剥削他们自己国内的人民，并加紧奴役被压迫的民族，以实现他们的战争计划。为了这个原因，保卫世界和平已经成为我们不可避免的任务了。
    我们中国人是爱好和平的人民，帝国主义和封建主义在我国的百年统治，已迫使我们站起来而且进行了反对压迫者的长期而艰苦的斗争。现在，我们已获得了有历史意义的胜利。现在，中国人民已经在基本上赢得了民族独立、人民民主和和平建设的条件。为了保卫远东及全世界的和平，为了防止日本帝国主义的复活及日本或任何其他帝国主义国家侵略行为的恢复，我们已经和我们的伟大盟邦苏联签订了友好同盟互助条约。这两大国家七亿人民的联合力量，一定会在争取和平的斗争中起重要的作用。
    我从北京来，途经苏联及欧洲人民民主国家。我亲眼看见了这些国家的人民如何在献身于和平、自由和幸福生活的建设，他们对和平的希望是如何强烈，以及他们对战争的憎恨是如何强烈。
    今天，拥护和平的力量是在迅速地成长着，全世界的人民都采取积极的步骤在反对战争。我向社会主义国家和人民民主国家的人民致敬：他们正在加倍努力从事经济建设，因而加强了和平的堡垒。我向资本主义国家的劳动人民致敬：他们正在进行反对战争准备的艰苦斗争，拒绝装卸战争物资或从事战争生产，坚决地为改善他们的境况而斗争。我向殖民地和半殖民地的人民致敬：他们正在英勇地为民族独立、人民民主与世界和平而斗争。
    在短短的两个月中间，要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言，已经得到全世界不同政治信仰和不同社会阶层人民的惊人的响应。这是一个令人信服的证据，表示人民对于和平的渴望是多么强烈。形势已经非常明显，只有少数的战争贩子及其走狗们才主张战争，而全世界大多数的人民是主张和平的。
    争取和平的斗争是一个正义的事业，我们的力量是强大的。让我们使用一切我们可以使用的方法来加强我们的战斗吧！再把更多的几百万的人民引进我们的队伍里来吧！我们要揭穿战争贩子们的一切谎言，使他们不可能用它来欺骗他们的人民，以及把这些人民引向战争。要永远记着，在争取和平的战斗中，全世界的人民都是和我们站在一起的。满怀信心地去战斗吧，我们是会在全世界上击败战争贩子们，粉碎他们罪恶的计划，并赢得全世界的持久和平的。帝国主义者和战争贩子们正在自掘坟墓，希特勒的可耻的下场就是他们将来的命运。
