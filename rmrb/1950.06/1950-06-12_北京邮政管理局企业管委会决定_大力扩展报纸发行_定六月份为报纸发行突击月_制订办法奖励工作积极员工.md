　　Beijing Postal Administration Enterprise Management Committee Decides
    Vigorously Expand Newspaper Distribution
    Designates June as Newspaper Distribution Blitz Month
    Formulates Measures to Reward Active Employees
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Beijing Postal Administration Enterprise Management Committee has passed a resolution designating June as a newspaper distribution blitz month. Newspaper distribution work has now become one of the main businesses of the post office. Because newspapers are a powerful weapon for the Party and the government to closely connect with the masses, the Party and the government rely on newspapers to convey various policies and work decisions to the masses; at the same time, the masses also reflect their production, life and other aspects through newspapers. This determines the importance of newspaper distribution work. According to the nature of the People's Post and the current distribution of postal institutions, there are conditions to do a good job in distribution.
    The Beijing Postal Administration plans to launch a campaign in June to increase the distribution of the People's Daily by two thousand copies in the city. In order to encourage active employees in the distribution work, it has been decided to implement reward measures. In addition to group rewards, individual awards will be based on the number of newspaper subscribers developed by each person.

　　北京邮政管理局企业管委会决定
    大力扩展报纸发行
    定六月份为报纸发行突击月
    制订办法奖励工作积极员工
    【本报讯】北京邮政管理局企业管理委员会已通过定六月份为报纸发行突击月的决议。报纸的发行工作，目前已成为邮局主要业务之一。因为报纸是党与政府密切联系群众的有力武器，党与政府依靠报纸把各种政策、工作决定传达给群众；同时群众也通过报纸把生产、生活等方面的情形反映出来。这就确定了报纸发行工作的重要性。根据人民邮政的性质和目前邮政机构的分布情况来看，是有条件把发行工作作好的。
    北京邮政管理局拟于六月份开展在本市增加两千份人民日报运动。为了鼓励发行工作中外的积极员工，决定实行奖励办法。除团体奖励，个人奖将以每人发展报纸订户数目的多寡为奖励根据。
