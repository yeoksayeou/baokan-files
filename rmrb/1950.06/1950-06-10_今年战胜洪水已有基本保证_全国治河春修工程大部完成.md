Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The national river management spring repair projects for 1950 (including river diversion, dike repair, levee restoration, breach closure, dredging, etc.) are now mostly completed. The scale of this year's spring repair projects for various rivers is unprecedented in Chinese history, with earthwork alone reaching 300 million cubic meters. Due to the moderate to severe flooding that affected vast areas of China last year, people's lives and agricultural production suffered greatly. Therefore, the people in the various river basins across the country are urgently demanding water management this year. The Chinese People's Government, despite the country's financial difficulties, has allocated a large amount of funding for water conservancy projects to carry out such massive spring repair projects in order to overcome floods and water disasters, and to ensure the restoration and development of agricultural production.

Unprecedentedly Large Scale of River Management, with Earthwork Reaching 300 Million Cubic Meters

The Yellow River, one of the key focuses of spring repairs, has had a total earthwork volume of over 10 million cubic meters for levee restoration and hazard remediation projects this year (excluding Suiyuan Province's projects), and 7 million cubic meters had been completed by May 10th. Before the end of April, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission had also transported all the materials prepared for flood prevention and hazard repair this summer, including 318,000 cubic meters of stone, 67.64 million catties of straw, and over 400,000 wooden stakes, to the construction sites.

The most demanding water management task is in the East China region, where over 100 million cubic meters of earthwork out of the region's 180 million cubic meters of projects (part of which belongs to the second half of the year's project plan) had been completed by the end of April, accounting for 56% of the total project. Among them, the Yangtze River main dike restoration project involved 25 million cubic meters of earthwork, and about 72% had been completed by mid-April. The Huai River main dike restoration project involved 6.35 million cubic meters of earthwork, and 80% had been completed by the end of April. It is expected that these major projects will be fully completed by the end of this month. The first phase of the Subei Yi River Diversion Project involved 27 million cubic meters of earthwork, and was fully completed by May 20th.

According to statistics on the spring repair projects of various rivers in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hunan Provinces, and the breach closure projects of the Yangtze and Han Rivers in Hubei Province in the Central and South China region, the total earthwork was more than 55.7 million cubic meters, of which more than 52.2 million cubic meters had been completed by the beginning of May, accounting for approximately 95% of the total project. Over 90% of the stonework has also been completed. Among them, the dike repair and polder restoration projects in various counties along Dongting Lake and the Xiang and Yuan Rivers in Hunan Province have now completed 99% of the total earthwork. The main dikes of the Yangtze and Han Rivers in Hubei Province have also completed over 94%. The dike repair projects in various counties along the river and lake in Jiangxi Province were completed ahead of schedule by the end of April.

The total earthwork for spring repair of various rivers in North China provinces is more than 27 million cubic meters. Due to the late start of construction, only 40% has been completed. Among them, the first phase of the Chaobai River downstream regulation project, which is the largest in scale and the most difficult to construct, had completed 36% by the end of April. The Yongding River floodplain regulation project had also completed 47.5% by the end of April.

The total earthwork in Northeast China is more than 30.5 million cubic meters, and 30% has now been completed. In addition, the earthwork of more than 13 million cubic meters in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been completed by 70%.

Localities Emphasize Engineering Standards, and Quality is Generally Better Than in Previous Years

In this year's spring repair projects, water management leading organizations in various localities strictly implemented the "Instructions on the 1950 Spring Repair Projects for Water Conservancy" issued by the Government Administration Council, and emphasized engineering standards, so the quality of the projects is generally better than in previous years. For example, the Yellow River dike work generally achieved a degree of compaction where four "gongcun" of loose soil was compacted to three "gongcun" to 2.8 "gongcun." In the past, the Yangtze River dikes never had the practice of ramming, but this year, some sections have achieved layer-by-layer ramming. In the past, the most difficult part to fill and strengthen was the joint section of the dikes. This year, many areas specially organized contracting teams to be solely responsible for doing a good job in the joint sections. In areas where attention to engineering quality was initially poor, improvements were mostly made after inspection and correction by the local leading organizations.

Due to the organization and leadership of the People's Government and its affiliated water conservancy agencies, and the enthusiasm and initiative shown by the broad masses who recognized the vital interests of water conservancy construction, the efficiency of this year's spring repair projects is generally higher than in the past. In Hebei Province, the record for earthwork construction in the Nan Canal last year was an average of 2.2 cubic meters per person per day. This year it is 3.9 cubic meters. The highest individual record for Yellow River dike repair last year was 17 cubic meters per day. This year, Xia Chongwen from Huangtang Village, Juancheng County, achieved 27.65 cubic meters, creating an unprecedented record. A collective movement to create new records was launched on the Yellow River dikes, and seven migrant worker groups in Juancheng County achieved an average of over 10 cubic meters per worker, with the highest being an average of 16.83 cubic meters.

Combining Disaster Relief with Work-for-Relief, Millions of Disaster Victims Survive the Spring Famine

This year, various localities combined disaster relief with work-for-relief in the process of carrying out spring repair projects, which played a huge role in providing relief to the spring famine in various regions. According to statistics from the East China and Central South China regions (excluding Henan Province) and Hebei and Pingyuan Provinces alone, a total of more than 3 million disaster victims participated in river repair, and the total value of their wages can enable more than 10 million disaster victims to smoothly survive the spring famine.

The spring repair projects for the main rivers' dikes this year are all based on the standard of resisting floods of the same magnitude as in 1949. The completion of the spring repair projects is a basic guarantee for overcoming floods this year. However, due to the vastness of the projects, the urgency of the time, and the fact that the projects were carried out on the basis of the dilapidated river channels and dikes left by the Kuomintang reactionary rulers for many years, the attention to quality inspection in some areas is still insufficient. Therefore, individual projects or dike sections still cannot fully meet the engineering requirements. The river channels of a few rivers are too narrow and therefore still cannot accommodate larger floods, and the internal water drainage problems in some areas have not yet been completely resolved. Now that the arrival of the major flood season for each river is not far away, reducing and avoiding water disasters this year still requires further joint efforts by the governments and people of various regions.

　　今年战胜洪水已有基本保证
    全国治河春修工程大部完成
    【新华社八日讯】一九五○年度全国治河的春修工程（包括导河、修堤、复堤、堵口、疏浚等在内）现已大部完成。今年各河春修工程的规模在我国历史上是空前的，仅土方即达三亿公方。由于去年我国广大地区遭受到或轻或重的水灾，人民生活与农业生产受到很大的损失。因此今年全国各江河流域人民迫切要求治水。中国人民政府在国家财政困难的情况下拨出大量的水利工程费用，举办如此巨大的春修工程，为的是战胜洪水、克服水患，以保证农业生产的恢复和发展。
    治河规模空前巨大土方共达三亿公方
    春修重点之一的黄河，今年复堤整险工程的土方共达一千余万公方（绥远工程未统计在内），到五月十日已完成了七百余万公方。在四月底以前，黄河水利委员会并已将准备今夏防汛修险的全部工料，包括石料三十一万八千公方、秸料六千七百六十四万余斤、木桩四十余万根，运抵施工地点。
    治水任务最繁重的是华东区，该区一亿八千余万公方土方的工程（其中一部分属于下半年的工程计划）在四月底时即已完成了一亿公方以上，占全部工程的百分之五十六。其中长江干堤修复工程土方二千五百万公方，四月中旬已完成约百分之七十二。淮河干堤修复工程土方六百三十五万公方，四月底已完成百分之八十。以上这些主要工程，预计本月底即可全部完成。苏北导沂第一期工程的春修部分计土方二千七百万公方，则于五月二十日已全部完成。
    中南区的工程，据广东、江西、湖南各河的春修工程和湖北长江、汉水的堵复工程统计，土工共为五千五百七十余万公方，到五月初已完成者达五千二百余万公方，约占全部工程的百分之九十五；石工也完成了百分之九十以上。其中湖南洞庭湖及湘、沅两江沿岸各县的修堤复垸工程现已完成总土方的百分之九十九；湖北长江、汉水干堤也已完成百分之九十四以上；江西省沿江沿湖各县修堤工程则在四月底时即已超计划完工。
    华北各省各河春修的土工共为二千七百余万公方，因动工较迟，现仅完成百分之四十。其中规模最大、难工最多的潮白河下游第一期整理工程，至四月底已完成百分之三十六；永定河泛区整理工程四月底也已完成百分之四十七点五。
    东北全区土工共为三千零五十余万公方，现亦完成了百分之三十。另内蒙自治区的土工一千三百余万公方则已完成百分之七十。
    各地重视工程标准质量一般比往年好
    今年的春修工程中，各地治水领导机构严格地执行了政务院所发布的“一九五○年水利春修工程的指示”，重视工程标准，因此工程质量一般较往年为好。如黄河堤工一般做到了将四公寸虚土打实到三公寸至二点八公寸的程度。长江堤过去从无打硪习惯，今年却也有一部分做到了层土层硪。过去最不容易填筑坚实的堤段接合部分，今年许多地区特别组织了包工队，使之单独负责把接合部分的工程做好。开始时对工程质量注意较差的地区，在当地领导机构检查纠正后亦多有改进。
    由于人民政府及其各所属水利机关的组织领导，和广大群众认识到兴修水利的切身利益而发挥了热情和积极性，今年春修工程效率一般较过去提高。河北省去年兴修南运河的土方工纪录是平均每人每日二点二公方；今年是三点九公方。黄河修堤去年最高的个人纪录是每日十七公方，今年鄄城黄堂村夏崇文则作到了二七点六五公方，开创了史无前例的纪录。黄河堤上并曾开展集体的创造新纪录的运动，鄄城县的七个民工组都达到了每工平均十公方以上的纪录，最高的是平均十六点八三公方。
    结合救灾以工代赈千万灾民得度春荒
    今年各地在进行春修工程中均结合救灾工作实施以工代赈，对救济各地区的春荒起了极大的作用。仅据华东、中南（缺河南）两区和河北、平原两省的统计，灾民参加修河者即共达三百余万人，他们所获得的工资总值可使一千万以上的灾民顺利地度过春荒。
    今年各主要河流堤防的春修工程，都是以抵御和一九四九年同样的洪水为标准。春修工程的完成，对于今年战胜洪水，是一个基本的保证。但是，由于工程浩大，时间紧迫，工程是在国民党反动统治者多年来所留下的残破不堪的河道和堤防的基础上进行的，部分地区对工程的质量注意检查还不够，所以，个别工程或堤段仍不能完全符合工程要求，少数河流的河槽过窄因而仍不能容纳较大的洪水，部分地区的内水排泄问题也还未完全获得解决。现在距离各河大汛到来已为期不远，要减少和避免今年的水患，还有待各地区政府与人民进一步的共同努力。
