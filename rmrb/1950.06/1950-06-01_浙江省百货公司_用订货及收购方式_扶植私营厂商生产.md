Zhejiang Provincial Department Store
    Uses Ordering and Purchasing Methods to Support Private Manufacturers' Production
    [This newspaper, Hangzhou News] To support production and to take care of the temporary difficulties of some manufacturers, the Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the China Department Store Company signed an ordering contract with the privately-owned Hangzhou Dazhong Toothbrush Factory on May 10th. The total number of toothbrushes ordered this time is 75,000 of various types, to be delivered in three months, with 25,000 to be delivered each month. The quality must be improved. If the quality does not meet the requirements, the factory will be responsible for compensation. At the same time, the price is clearly stipulated. The signing of this contract solved the factory's sales difficulties and eliminated the workers' worries about unemployment. The company also acquired products from private enterprises such as the Southeast Soap Factory, which was experiencing sales difficulties. It has now acquired 1,000 boxes of Southeast "Ship Brand" soap, 10 boxes of "Ship Brand" medicated soap, 80 dozens of various rubber shoes produced by the Hongda Rubber Factory, and 460 dozens of various undershirts, vests, and towels from the Wuzhou National Goods Cooperative.
