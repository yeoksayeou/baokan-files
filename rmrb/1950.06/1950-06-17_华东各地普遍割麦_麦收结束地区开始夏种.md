【Shanghai News】 Jiefang Daily News: Wheat harvesting work has fully commenced across East China. A bumper wheat harvest in Fujian has been previously reported. Farmers in Zhejiang began summer harvesting in mid-May, and barley, broad beans, rapeseed, and wheat in some areas have already been harvested. However, due to rain, waterlogging and insect pests, the harvest is slightly lower than last year. Summer harvesting has fully commenced in Southern Jiangsu. Currently, barley has been completely harvested in Changshu, Jiading, Kunshan, and the suburbs of Shanghai, while wheat harvesting has also begun in counties such as Wuxian and Jiangning. After the Political Department of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region issued a notice in mid-May regarding safeguarding summer harvests, troops have begun taking action, assisting poor farmers with no labor force to harvest, and assisting villagers in organizing night patrols and strengthening patrols.

Barley and rapeseed have been harvested in Southern Anhui. Wheat can also be harvested by mid-June. Currently, farmers are engaged in a frenzy of cutting wheat, harrowing fields, and fertilizing fields.

According to reports from various special districts and counties in Southern Anhui: The summer harvest area in Chizhou Special District totals 461,985 mu, the summer harvest area in Huizhou Special District totals 224,067 mu, the summer harvest area in Xuancheng Special District totals 642,877 mu, and the summer harvest area in Wudang Special District totals 613,263 mu.

Wheat ripens earlier in southern Northern Jiangsu, where harvesting, plowing, and planting are being carried out simultaneously, while wheat in the north will also begin to be harvested. Northern Anhui successfully weathered the spring famine and is now enthusiastically launching summer harvest and summer planting campaigns. Local troops are also assisting farmers in harvesting wheat and transplanting rice seedlings. In the severely affected Suxian Special District, farmers are urgently organizing labor to engage in harvesting and planting. After the wheat harvesting work in the Chaohu Special District generally began in the middle of last month, it has now been largely completed. Early-maturing crops in counties such as Feidong, Feixi, and Lujiang, such as March Yellow barley, broad beans, peas, and rapeseed, have now been harvested, and wheat has also begun to be threshed. The wheat harvesting work in counties such as Hanshan, He County, and Wuwei has been completed by about 70%. The wheat field area in this special district is 1,844,604 mu. Due to the increase in planted area through land reclamation, the total actual wheat harvest this year is higher than in previous years. Except for the three special districts of Wendeng, Laiyang, and Jiaozhou in eastern Shandong Province, the eight special districts in the west, south, and central regions have successively begun harvesting wheat and are gradually expanding eastward. As of the 5th of this month, harvesting has been completed in some areas. Farmers are carrying out harvesting with great enthusiasm, with men, women, old, and young all going to the fields together, working day and night to seize the harvest. Except for a few areas affected by disease, waterlogging, and hail, the province can generally be considered to have had a bumper harvest. For example, wheat production in Wolong District, Licheng, has increased by 20% compared to last year. In the Linyi area, yields in high-yielding areas have reached more than 300 jin per mu. In areas where wheat harvesting has ended, farmers have begun hoeing the stubble, transporting manure, and preparing for summer planting. After the wheat crops from different provinces were harvested, the spring famine has basically been overcome, but in order to prevent the summer famine, various localities are now mobilizing the masses to save and economize, make long-term plans, formulate specific plans, and plant a large number of early-maturing crops to prevent the summer famine.

　　华东各地普遍割麦  麦收结束地区开始夏种
    【上海讯】解放日报消息：华东各地麦收工作已全面展开。福建麦子丰收，前已报道。浙江农民在五月中开始进行夏收，现大麦、蚕豆、油菜及某些地区的小麦已经收割完毕。但因雨水虫灾，略较去年歉收。苏南夏收已全面展开。现常熟、嘉定、昆山及上海市郊等地大麦已全部收割完毕，吴县、江宁等县小麦并已开始收割。苏南军区政治部五月中发出关于保卫夏收工作的通知后，各部队现已开始行动起来，帮助驻地附近贫苦无劳动力的农民收割，并协助村民组织防夜，加强巡逻。
    皖南大麦和油菜已经收割完毕。小麦六月中旬亦可收割完结。现农民正卷入割麦耙田、肥田的热潮。
    据皖南各专区、各县汇报：池州专区夏收面积共四十六万一千九百八十五亩，徽州专区夏收面积共二十二万四千零六十七亩，宣城专区夏收面积共六十四万二千八百七十七亩，芜当专区夏收面积共六十一万三千二百六十三亩。
    苏北南部麦熟较早，正边收边耕边种，北部麦子亦将开始收割。皖北区胜利度过春荒，现正热烈展开夏收、夏种运动，各地驻军亦协助农民收麦、插秧。重灾区宿县专区，农民正紧张地组织劳动力，投入收割耕种。巢湖专区麦收工作，于上月中旬普遍开始后，现已大部完成。肥东、肥西、庐江等县早熟庄稼。如三月黄大麦、蚕豆、豌豆、油菜等现已收割完毕，小麦亦已开始登场。含山、和县、无为等县麦收工作，已完成约百分之七十以上。该专区麦田面积一百八十四万四千六百零四亩，由于开荒增加了种植面积，故今年麦子总的实际收获量比往年增加。山东省除东部文登、莱阳、胶州等三个专区外，西部、南部和中部的八个专区已先后开始收麦，并逐步向东展开，至本月五日为止，已有部分地区收割完毕。农民们均以高度热情进行收割，男女老少一齐下地，日夜抢收。该省除少数遭受病水雹灾地区外，一般可称丰收。如历城卧龙区小麦比去年增产二成，临沂一带，产量高者每亩达三百余斤。目前麦收已结束之地区，农民已开始锄茬、送粪，准备夏种。该区各省麦子接口后，春荒基本上已胜利度过，但为了防止夏荒，现各地正动员群众，省吃俭用，作长期打算，订出具体计划，并大量种植早熟作物，以防夏荒。
