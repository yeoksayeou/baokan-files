Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: Comrade Li Lisan's explanation on several points regarding the Draft Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China at the Eighth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, the full text is as follows: Chairman, fellow members:

　　The draft trade union law, now submitted to this meeting of the Central People's Government Committee for discussion, has undergone a considerable drafting process. This bill was initially drafted by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions based on the requests and opinions of trade union organizations across the country. After being discussed and revised at the National Trade Union Organization Conference, it was made into a preliminary draft and submitted to the Labor Department of the Central People's Government for review. The Ministry of Labor submitted the draft to the National Labor Bureau Chiefs Conference, which included representatives from local trade union organizations and industrialists, for detailed study and modification. It was then submitted to the State Council for discussion. The State Council first sent the draft to the Finance and Economics Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for review and approval before submitting it to the 29th meeting of the State Council on April 21 for discussion and approval, and then to the Central People's Government Committee for review and approval. At the same time, it was decided to publish the draft in newspapers to solicit opinions from the people across the country. Over the past two months, heated discussions have been held among people's organizations, newspapers, and especially trade union organizations and worker masses across the country. As a result, in addition to some suggested revisions to individual articles, unanimous support was expressed for this draft trade union law. This shows that this draft trade union law truly reflects the will and demands of the people across the country, especially the broad masses of workers. This fact also demonstrates that the legislative method of the People's Government is fundamentally different from the legislative method of all reactionary governments. Any reactionary government is formed by a small number of representatives from the reactionary ruling class or even a certain reactionary group, who formulate laws to force the majority to comply and deprive the majority of their interests for the private gain of a few. Our People's Government formulates laws based on Chairman Mao's principle of "from the masses, to the masses." Therefore, laws promulgated by the People's Government must conform to the interests of the broad masses of people and must be supported by them. This is one of the main characteristics of New Democratic politics.

　　Since the draft trade union law has undergone repeated research and extensive discussion by the people across the country, there is no need to explain the articles in detail. I will now only raise the following more important issues for a brief explanation:

　　(1) Regarding the nature of trade unions. Article 1 of the draft trade union law stipulates that "trade unions are mass organizations voluntarily formed by the working class." This indicates that joining a trade union is a freedom and right of every worker. This is completely different from the fascist-style trade union laws promulgated by the Kuomintang reactionary government, which forced workers to join trade unions and turned trade unions into organizations for controlling workers. It also stipulates that "all manual and mental wage laborers and wage laborers without fixed employers who work in all enterprises, institutions, and schools within China and whose wage income is the entire or main source of their livelihood have the right to organize trade unions." This shows that every wage laborer, as long as they truly rely on wage income for their livelihood, regardless of which enterprise or institution they work in, has the right to join a trade union organization. This is completely different from the trade union laws promulgated by the Kuomintang reactionary government and certain capitalist countries, which prohibit a large number of workers and employees (such as civil servants in government agencies and employees in the munitions industry, such as some states in the United States that do not allow blacks to join trade unions, etc.) from organizing trade unions. This is in complete accordance with the spirit of Article 5 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which stipulates that the people have the freedom of assembly, association, etc., without any "proviso" or restriction. Stipulating that only wage laborers can join trade unions demonstrates the class nature of trade unions. Stipulating that every wage laborer can join trade unions without any political or other restrictions demonstrates the mass nature of trade unions. Stipulating that every wage laborer has the right, but not the obligation, to join a trade union demonstrates the voluntary nature of trade unions.

　　(2) The relationship between trade unions and the People's Government. The draft trade union law stipulates that the People's Government entrusts trade unions with the responsibility of supervising the administrative aspects of state-owned enterprises and the capitalists of private enterprises to effectively implement all labor protection laws promulgated by the government (Articles 7 and 12). At the same time, it provides trade unions with various material support and preferential treatment (Articles 10, 11, 20, and 24, paragraphs 2 and 4, etc.). On the other hand, the draft trade union law also stipulates that "trade unions, in order to protect the fundamental interests of the working class, in accordance with their charters and resolutions," "educate and organize the masses of workers and staff, uphold the laws of the People's Government, and promote the policies of the People's Government to consolidate the people's power led by the working class." Such a reciprocal relationship of government protecting trade unions and trade unions supporting the government is only possible in socialist and new democratic countries. Because in these countries, the broad masses of workers know from their own personal experience that the government was personally established by the working class and the broad masses of people after long sacrifices and struggles to overthrow reactionary rule. Only by consolidating their own government can the working class guarantee the ultimate victory of their own liberation and gradually improve their living conditions to achieve the highest and most fulfilling life. Therefore, only in socialist and new democratic countries will the masses of workers display a high degree of enthusiasm for truly loving the motherland and supporting the government. On the other hand, the People's Government must also rely on trade unions to unite the broad masses of workers as its pillar. In any city, wage laborers and their families account for more than half of the urban population. For example, in Beijing, with a population of two million, there are about 400,000 wage laborers. Assuming each person has two family members, then wage laborers and their families number more than 1.2 million. For example, in Shanghai, with a population of six million, more than 1.1 million are wage laborers. Including their families, there are more than 3.3 million. If trade unions can organize all wage laborers and unite their families around the trade union, they can become the most important pillar of the People's Government in the cities.

　　(3) The relationship between trade unions and state-owned and private enterprises. Among the opinions submitted on the draft trade union law, some comrades believe that there is no class antagonism in state-owned enterprises. The workers and staff working in them are serving the people and the working class, and should not be called wage laborers. In fact, this employment relationship is in terms of the form expressed by the wage system. Since there is still a wage system in state-owned enterprises, the form of employment relationship still exists. However, the essence of this employment relationship is different from the employment relationship in capitalist enterprises. This employment relationship is a public-private relationship. Therefore, in state-owned enterprises, the policy of taking into account both public and private interests should be firmly implemented, and trade unions still have the responsibility to protect the interests of the masses of workers and staff. It is precisely because the employment relationship in state-owned enterprises is a relationship between the public and the private, that is, the employer is the entire people and the employee is a part of the entire people, that all labor products of wage laborers are entirely owned by the entire people. Therefore, there is no exploitation and no relationship of exploitation. In private enterprises, the ownership of the entire enterprise belongs to the private owner. Here, all labor products of wage laborers (including the products created by necessary labor and surplus labor) are owned by the enterprise owner. Therefore, there is still exploitation and still a relationship of exploitation. It is precisely because state-owned enterprises belong to the entire people that the draft trade union law stipulates that trade unions have the right to represent the employed workers and staff in participating in production management (Article 5) and participating in the enterprise management committee (Article 8). Private enterprises belong to private owners, so trade union representatives of the employed workers and staff participate in labor-management consultation meetings. In this issue, state-owned enterprises and private enterprises are different and should not be forced to be the same.

　　However, whether in state-owned enterprises or private enterprises, increasing production and developing production are increasing national wealth and increasing social wealth, which is beneficial to the country, beneficial to the people, and beneficial to the working class. In this sense, the employees working in private enterprises are also serving the country and serving the people. Labor is a glorious undertaking, whether working in state-owned enterprises or private enterprises. Therefore, Article 9 of the draft trade union law stipulates that "trade unions, in order to protect the fundamental interests of the working class, in accordance with their charters and resolutions," "educate and organize the masses of workers and staff, establish new labor attitudes, abide by labor discipline, organize production competitions and other production movements to ensure the completion of production plans." This should be done in both state-owned enterprises and private enterprises. That is to say, trade union organizations in private enterprises should also focus on production as their central task, because only in this way can they conform to the fundamental interests of the working class. On the other hand, private enterprise owners, like the administrative aspects of state-owned enterprises, must rely on workers to do a good job in production. Therefore, they must change the previous method of managing workers through oppression and coercion, change the mentality and attitude of underestimating workers, and adopt an open, honest, democratic, and consultative approach to make it easier for trade unions to mobilize and organize workers' enthusiasm for production. Of course, trade unions should also protect the daily interests of the employed workers and staff and supervise the capitalists to effectively implement all labor protection laws promulgated by the government (Article 7) to achieve the goal of mutual benefit for labor and capital in the development of production. In short, although state-owned and private enterprises are different in nature, trade unions should gradually treat them equally in terms of doing a good job in production and even labor conditions.

　　(4) Regarding basic trade union organizations. Basic trade union organizations refer to trade union organizations in production units or administrative units such as factories, mines, shops, farms, institutions, and schools. This is the most basic link in the trade union organizational system. In production enterprises, the central task of trade union organizations is to educate and organize the masses of workers and staff, establish new labor attitudes, abide by labor discipline, organize production competitions, cherish public property, oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucratic work styles to ensure the completion of production plans. In administrative agencies, the central task of basic trade union organizations is also to educate and organize agency staff, establish new labor attitudes, abide by labor discipline, organize work competitions, improve work efficiency and accuracy, oppose red tape and procrastination, and fight against bureaucracy to ensure the completion of administrative work plans. As for the tasks of basic trade union organizations in protecting the daily interests of workers and staff, carrying out various mutual assistance and cultural and recreational facilities, as well as education and organization work, are exactly the same whether in production enterprises or administrative agencies. Therefore, if there is a sound basic trade union organization that can unite all workers and staff to fight for the completion of production plans or work plans, it is the best guarantee for the administrative aspects to complete their tasks. Therefore, not only the administrative aspects in state-owned enterprises, but also enlightened capitalists and factory directors in private enterprises are willing to have sound basic trade union organizations in their own enterprises. However, in order to enable basic trade union organizations to be sound and consolidated, they must be given all necessary convenient conditions. Therefore, Articles 18, 20, 21, and 22 of the draft trade union law stipulate the rights enjoyed by basic trade union organizations and the material assistance that should be provided by the administrative aspects or capitalists of state-owned enterprises. All of these are necessary conditions for basic trade union organizations to facilitate their work.

　　Regarding the number of committee members of basic trade union committees who are detached from production to specialize in trade union work, some trade union organizations in Northeast and North China feel that the number stipulated in the draft trade union law is too small, making it inconvenient to carry out trade union work. We believe that this opinion is inappropriate. Experience has shown that having too many cadres detached from production only hinders mass work and makes it impossible to do a good job in mass work. At present, there is a fairly serious phenomenon of substitution and forcing orders and leaving the masses in trade union work. One of the main reasons is that there are too many cadres detached from production, especially too many cadres sent from outside. The mass work of trade unions can only be done well by organizing the broad masses of workers to do it themselves and attracting more active elements who are not detached from production to do it. Only in this way can it be full of vitality and truly make the broad masses of workers feel that the trade union is their own organization. Dalian Far East Electric Cement Plant has more than 1,100 workers, and only the trade union chairman and trade union secretary (according to the trade union law, there can be three) are detached from production. They organized the active elements generated in the masses into ten committees to share various tasks, and did a very good job of trade union work, which can be called a model basic organization. On the contrary, Longfeng Coal Mine in Northeast China has more than 18,000 workers with a total of 63 cadres detached from production. As a result, the cadres and trade union organizations are separated from the masses, losing the mass nature of the trade union organization and causing dissatisfaction among the masses. These examples are enough to prove that too many cadres detached from production are not beneficial to the work, but harmful to the work. Therefore, we have not adopted these amendments. As for the new areas that have been liberated not long ago, during the period of opening up work and establishing trade union organizations, with the approval of the higher-level trade union organizations, the number of working cadres detached from production can be appropriately increased, but not too much, as too much is still harmful to the work.

　　The above are the more important issues in the draft trade union law that I would like to explain.

　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class has fought for the freedom to organize trade unions for nearly 30 years, paying a great price of sacrifice and bloodshed. The historically famous "February 7th" general strike was also to fight for the freedom to organize trade unions, resulting in the brutal massacre by the then imperialist lackeys and feudal warlords. Since then, for the past 28 years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class has developed from fighting for the freedom to organize trade unions to uniting the people of the whole country to oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. They have suffered continuous suppression, devastation, and massacres, and many advanced working-class leaders and outstanding elements have sacrificed their lives. Now, they have finally won victory, overthrown reactionary rule, and established a people's power led by the working class. The masses of workers have gained the true freedom to organize trade unions and all political freedoms and rights, and can propose such a progressive draft trade union law that is beneficial to the working class and beneficial to the entire people. We request the Central People's Government Committee to pass this draft trade union law, because this is the demand of the broad masses of workers and is completely in line with the spirit of the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference. We believe that the promulgation of the trade union law will surely promote the faster development of trade union organizations, making them a strong pillar of the People's Government, and will further enhance the consciousness of the working class, enabling the broad masses of workers to be firmly united under the banner of Chairman Mao to fight for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation.

　　李立三委员在中央人民政府委员会第八次会议上所作的
    关于中华人民共和国工会法草案的几点说明
    【新华社二十八日讯】李立三委员在中央人民政府委员会第八次会议上所作的关于中华人民共和国工会法草案的几点说明，全文如下：主席、各位委员：
    现在提请中央人民政府委员会本次会议讨论的工会法草案，经过了相当长时期的起草过程。这个法案，最初是由中华全国总工会根据全国各地工会组织的要求和意见起草，经过全国工会组织会议讨论修正，作成初步草案，提请中央人民政府劳动部审查。劳动部将该草案提到了有各地工会组织和工商业者代表参加的全国劳动局长会议上作过详细的研究并加以修改，然后提请政务院讨论。政务院首先将该草案送请人民政协全国委员会财经组审查，得到同意后，才提到四月二十一日第二十九次政务会议讨论通过，提请中央人民政府委员会审查批准。同时又决定将草案先在报上发表，征求全国人民的意见。两个月来，在全国各地人民团体中，报章上，特别是工会组织和工人群众中展开了热烈的讨论。结果除对个别条文提出了一些修改的意见外，一致表示拥护这个工会法草案。可见这个工会法草案是真正反映了全国人民，首先是广大工人群众的意志和要求的。这个事实，同时也就表明了人民政府立法的方法是与一切反动政府立法的方法根本不同的。任何反动政府都是由反动统治阶级以至某一个反动集团的少数代表，为了少数人的私利，制定法令来强制大多数人执行，剥夺大多数人的利益。我们人民政府是根据毛主席指示的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的原则来制定法令，因此人民政府颁布法令都一定要符合广大人民的利益，一定要获得广大人民群众的拥护。这也就是新民主主义政治的主要特征之一。
    工会法草案既然经过了三番四复的研究，经过了全国人民的广泛讨论，因此对草案的条文，就没有详细解释的必要了。我现在只提出下面几个比较重要的问题作一些简单的说明：
    （一）关于工会的性质。工会法草案第一条规定“工会是工人阶级自愿结合的群众组织”，这是说明参加工会与否，是每个工人的自由和权利。这与国民党反动政府所颁布的法西斯式的工会法，强迫工人加入工会，把工会变成管制工人的组织是完全不同的。同时又规定“凡在中国境内一切企业、机关和学校中工作的，以工资收入为其生活资料之全部或主要来源的体力和脑力的雇佣劳动者及无固定雇主的雇佣劳动者均有组织工会之权”。这是说明了每个雇佣劳动者只要他真是靠工资收入为生活，不管他在什么企业或机关中工作，都有参加工会组织的权利。这与国民党反动政府及某些资本主义国家颁布的工会法，禁止很大一部分工人和职员（如政府机关公务员及军火工业中的员工，如美国有些州不让黑人加入工会等）组织工会是完全不同的。这是与中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第五条规定人民有集会、结社等等自由权利而没有任何“但书”或限制的精神是完全符合的。规定只有雇佣劳动者才能加入工会，这是表明工会的阶级性，规定每个雇佣劳动者都可以加入工会而不加以任何政治信仰或其他的限制，这是表明工会的群众性，规定每个雇佣劳动者都有加入工会的权利而不是义务，这是表明工会是工人群众自愿结合的性质。
    （二）工会与人民政府的关系。在工会法草案上规定，人民政府付与工会以监督国营企业行政方面与私营企业的资方切实执行政府所颁布的一切保护劳动的法令的责任（第七条，第十二条），同时并给工会以各种物质方面的支持和优惠待遇（第十条，第十一条，第二十条，第二十四条二、四两项等）。另一方面，工会法草案又规定“工会为保护工人阶级的根本利益，根据其章程与决议”，“教育并组织工人职员群众，维护人民政府法令，推行人民政府政策，以巩固工人阶级领导的人民政权”。像这样政府保护工会，工会拥护政府的相互关系，只有在社会主义国家和新民主主义国家才有可能实现。因为在这些国家中的广大工人群众都从自己的切身经验中知道，政府是工人阶级和广大人民群众长期牺牲奋斗，推翻反动统治后所亲手建立起来的，只有巩固自己的政府，才能保障工人阶级达到自己解放的最终胜利，才能逐渐改善生活条件达到最高的美满幸福的生活。所以只有在社会主义和新民主主义国家中，工人群众才会发挥真正爱护祖国、拥护政府的高度热情。另一方面，人民政府也必须依靠工会去团结广大工人群众作为自己的支柱。在任何一个城市中，雇佣劳动者加上他们的家属，都占城市人口半数以上，例如北京在二百万人口当中，有四十万左右雇佣劳动者，以每人有两口家属计算，那末，雇佣劳动者加上家属有一百二十万人以上。例如上海六百万人口中有一百一十多万是雇佣劳动者，加上他们的家属，便有三百三十万人以上。如果工会能把所有的雇佣劳动者都组织起来，并把他们的家属团结到工会的周围，便可成为人民政府在城市中的最主要的支柱。
    （三）工会与国营、私营企业的关系。在各地提出对工会法草案的意见中，有些同志认为国营企业中没有阶级对抗，在其中工作的工人和职员都是为人民服务，为工人阶级服务，不应当称为雇佣劳动者。其实这种雇佣关系是就工资制度所表现出来的形式来说的，在国营企业中既然还有工资制度存在，那末雇佣关系的形式也就仍然存在，但这种雇佣关系在实质上已经不同于资本主义企业中的雇佣关系，这种雇佣关系系是一种公私关系，所以在国营企业中应当坚决执行公私兼顾的政策，工会还有保护工人职员群众利益的责任。正由于在国营企业中的雇佣关系是一种公与私之间的关系，即雇主是全体人民，被雇者是全体人民中的一分子，所以在这里，雇佣劳动者的全部劳动产品是完全归全体人民所有，这就没有剥削存在，就不是剥削关系。在私营企业中整个企业的所有权属于私人，在这里，雇佣劳动者的全部劳动产品（包括必需劳动与剩余劳动所创造出来的产品）都是归企业主所有，这就还有剥削存在，就还是剥削关系。正由于国营企业是属于全体人民所有，所以工会法草案上规定工会有代表受雇的工人和职员参加生产管理的权利（第五条），参加企业管理委员会的权利（第八条）。私营企业是属于私人所有，所以工会代表受雇的工人职员参加劳资协商会议。在这个问题上，国营企业和私营企业是有所不同，而且不应强同的。
    但是，不管在国营企业中也好，在私营企业中也好，增加生产，发展生产都是增加国家财富，增加社会财富，都是于国家有利，于人民有利，于工人阶级有利。在这个意义上说，在私营企业中工作的职工，同样是为国家服务，为人民服务。劳动是光荣的事业，不管在国营企业或私营企业中工作都是一样的。所以在工会法草案第九条中规定“工会为保护工人阶级的根本利益，根据其章程与决议”，“教育并组织工人职员群众，树立新的劳动态度，遵守劳动纪律，组织生产竞赛及其他生产运动，以保证生产计划的完成”。这是无论在国营企业或私营企业中都应当这样作的。这就是说，在私营企业中的工会组织，同样应当以搞生产为自己的中心任务，因为只有这样，才符合于工人阶级的根本利益。另一方面，私营企业主也如国营企业的行政方面一样，必须依靠工人，才能搞好生产，因此必须改变以前靠压迫强制来管理工人的方法，改变轻视工人的心理和态度，对工人采取开诚布公，民主协商的方法，才能使工会易于动员和组织工人的生产积极性。当然，工会同时应当保护受雇工人和职员群众的日常利益，监督资方切实执行政府所颁布的一切保护劳动的法令（第七条），以实现在发展生产当中达到劳资两利的目的。总而言之，国营和私营企业虽然在性质上有所不同，但是工会在搞好生产问题以至劳动条件问题方面，应当逐渐做到一视同仁。
    （四）关于工会基层组织。工会基层组织是指工厂、矿场、商店、农场、机关、学校等生产单位或行政单位中的工会组织说的。这是工会组织系统中最基本的环节。在生产企业中，工会组织的中心任务是教育并组织工人职员群众，树立新的劳动态度，遵守劳动纪律，组织生产竞赛，爱护公共财产，反对贪污浪费和官僚主义作风，以保证生产计划的完成。在行政机关中，工会基层组织的中心任务，同样是教育和组织机关工作人员，树立新的劳动态度，遵守劳动纪律，组织工作竞赛，提高工作效率和精确性，反对文牍主义与拖拉作风，向官僚主义作斗争，以保证行政工作计划的完成。至于工会基层组织在保护工人职员日常利益，进行各种互助与文化娱乐设施，以及教育和组织工作方面的任务，更无论在生产企业或行政机关中，都是完全一样的。因此，如果有健全的工会基层组织，能团结全体工人职员为完成生产计划或工作计划而斗争，便是行政方面完成自己任务的最好的保证。所以不仅国营企业中的行政方面，而且私营企业中开明的资方和厂长都愿意自己企业中有健全的工会基层组织。但是要使工会基层组织能够健全巩固起来，必须给以一切必要的便利的条件，所以工会法草案有第十八，第二十，第二十一，第二十二等条规定了工会基层组织享有的权利及国营企业行政方面或资方应当给予的物质帮助，所有这些都是工会基层组织为了便于进行工作所必须的条件。
    关于工会基层委员会脱离生产，专门进行工会工作的委员人数，在东北及华北有些工会组织感到工会法草案上规定的人数过少，不便进行工会工作。我们认为：这种意见是不妥的。经验证明：脱离生产的干部过多，只有妨碍群众工作而无法做好群众工作。目前在工会工作中，存在着相当严重的包办代替强迫命令脱离群众的现象。其主要原因之一，是由于脱离生产干部太多，特别是由外面派去的干部太多。工会的群众工作只有组织广大工人群众自己来做，多多吸引不脱离生产的积极分子来做，才能做好，才能生气勃勃，才会使广大工人群众真正感觉到工会是他们自己的组织。大连远东电业洋灰厂有一千一百多工人，脱离生产的工会干部只有工会主席和工会秘书两人（按照工会法的规定可以有三人），他们把群众中产生的积极分子组成了十个委员会，分担各项工作，把工会工作做得很好，可以称为模范的基层组织。相反的东北龙凤煤矿一万八千多工人共有脱离生产的干部六十三人，结果干部及工会组织都脱离群众，失去了工会组织的群众性，并引起群众不满。这些例子足够证明，脱离生产干部太多，不是有益于工作，而是有害于工作的。所以这些修改的意见，我们没有采纳。至于在解放后不久的新区，在开辟工作，建立工会组织的时期，经过上级工会组织的批准；可以适当增加脱离生产的工作干部，但也不可太多，太多还是有害于工作的。
    以上就是我想说明的工会法草案中几个比较重要的问题。
    中国工人阶级在中国共产党领导下为争取组织工会的自由，奋斗了近三十年，付出了很大的牺牲流血代价。历史上有名的“二七”大罢工，也就是为了争取组织工会的自由，结果遭受当时帝国主义的走狗，封建军阀的残酷屠杀。自此以后二十八年来，中国工人阶级在中国共产党领导下，在毛主席领导下，从争取组织工会的自由，发展到团结全国人民，反对帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义统治的革命斗争，遭受过不断的镇压，摧残和屠杀，有许多先进的工人阶级领袖和优秀分子牺牲了自己的生命。到现在，终于获得了胜利，推翻了反动统治，建立了由工人阶级领导的人民政权，工人群众才获得真正组织工会的自由和一切政治自由权利，才能提出这样进步的有利于工人阶级并且有利于全体人民的工会法草案。我们请求中央人民政府委员会通过这个工会法草案，因为这是广大工人群众的要求，并且是完全符合于人民政协共同纲领精神的。我们相信，工会法的颁布，必能推进工会组织更快的发展，使它成为人民政府坚强的柱石，必能更进一步地提高工人阶级的觉悟，使广大工人群众都巩固地团结在毛主席旗帜下为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争。
