　　Concentrating Funds and Manpower to Overcome Temporary Difficulties:
    Beijing's Private Industrial Joint Operations Increase Daily
    Eleven Joint Operation Organizations Already Exist in Six Industries Including Knitting
    [Report from This Newspaper] Reporter Feng Zhong reports: Jointly operated factories in Beijing's private industry are gradually increasing. From last year to the present, there are already eleven organizations that have organized joint operations and continue to operate. These include six industries such as knitting, soap, printing, chemical industry, vehicle manufacturing, and fur processing. Among them, there are five knitting joint operation organizations, two soap organizations, and one each for the others. Joint operation can concentrate manpower, materials, and financial resources, increase working capital, reduce management and business expenses, and achieve the goals of reducing costs and improving quality. This operating method is very helpful for private industry to overcome the temporary difficulties in the current transition period. The scale of private industry in Beijing is generally small. According to a survey by the Municipal Industry Bureau, 85 percent of private factories in the city have fewer than ten employees. The vast majority are family handicrafts and small workshops with simple equipment and weak capital, making joint operation and concentrated production even more necessary.
    According to past experience of private factory joint operations, those that are based on voluntary participation, can truly concentrate funds, operate carefully, reduce expenses, and improve product quality can develop.
    The Beijing Soap Production and Sales Joint Cooperative is formed by the joint effort of four companies in Beijing's soap and alkali industry, including Lizhong, Dahua, Xinchang, and Youxin. Before the joint operation, they had made full preparations and had a thorough understanding of each other. After the joint operation, the original four managers scientifically divided the work, each with specific responsibilities, each giving full play to their strengths, and consulting with each other when problems arise; and they reduced non-production personnel, reducing miscellaneous expenses such as wages, food, rent, water, and electricity by about three-fifths, and production costs were reduced by 15 percent accordingly; the quality of soap was also improved to a soap content of 95 percent. Therefore, even in the current situation where soap is in surplus and most of the soap factories in the city are losing money, the cooperative can still maintain a surplus. The Beijing Knitting Joint Cooperative is formed by the joint effort of fifteen family handicraft knitting businesses and has also developed. Before the joint operation, each of them felt that their funds were insufficient, making it difficult to continue to operate. After the joint operation, due to the concentration of funds and the reduction of unnecessary personnel, although funds are still not sufficient, they can maintain operation. In addition, the specifications of products are unified, and the quality is also improved compared to before, so they are very popular in the Northwest. The shareholders of the cooperative were all stocking workers in the past, who grew up in hardship, so they are very united with each other. They carefully calculate the funds collected, and all of them are used for production except for necessary expenses. The managers and workers also work hard in the same way. With the support of loans from the People's Bank, production has gradually developed.
    Past experience has also proven that those who simply rely on government assistance, lack their own funds, and do not try to improve management and improve product quality, even if they are called "joint operations" and save expenses, it is difficult to maintain and tend to collapse. The Beijing Weaving and Dyeing Industry Joint Cooperative is one example. The cooperative is formed by five companies in Beijing's weaving and dyeing industry, including Xieshengxin, Gongda, Qingfeng, Tianlong, and Xinhua. Before the joint operation, the five companies spent a total of more than 27,000 catties of millet per month. After the joint operation, the expenses were saved, requiring only more than 10,000 catties of millet, but the output did not decrease. In such a good situation, it should have developed, but it collapsed after two months of operation. The reason is that three of the five factories had exhausted their funds before the joint operation and temporarily suspended work. After the joint operation, the five managers did not operate wholeheartedly, shirking responsibility and waiting and seeing when problems arise, and one could not come up with funds, and the other few did not want to take out more, only wanting to rely on government assistance everywhere with "joint operation" as a signboard, without seeking self-reliance. Another knitting industry joint operation of four mass factories did not have good preparations before the joint operation, and rashly joined operations without mature conditions. On the day before the start of work, the number of workers and stocking machines were decided, and personnel were also casually assigned, and no one was actually responsible. The four managers did not have enough understanding of each other, and each had their own opinions, and did not research or discuss when problems arise. Some managers even continued to operate their original factories, so the expenses remained huge after the joint operation, and the start-up costs alone wasted one-third of all funds. Finally, the funds ran out, and they had to close down.

### 集中资金人力克服暂时困难  京私营工业联营日增  针织等六个行业中已有联营组织十一个

　　集中资金人力克服暂时困难
    京私营工业联营日增   
    针织等六个行业中已有联营组织十一个
    【本报讯】记者冯仲报道：京市私营工业中联合经营的工厂已日渐增多。自去年至目前为止，已经组织联营而继续经营的，共有十一个组织，包括针织、肥皂、印刷、化学工业、制车、皮毛加工等六个行业，其中针织联营组织有五个，肥皂二个，其他均为一个。联合经营可以集中人力、物力、财力，增加周转资金，减少管理和营业上的开支，达到减低成本、提高质量的目的。这一经营方式，对私营工业克服目前转变期中的暂时困难，帮助很大。京市私营工业，一般规模都很小，据市工业局调查，全市私营工厂，职工在十人以下的占百分之八十五，绝大多数是家庭手工业和小作坊，设备简单，资金薄弱，因之更有联合经营、集中生产的必要。
    根据过去私营工厂联营的经验，凡是在自愿的基础上，真能集中资金，悉心经营，减少了开支，提高了产品质量的，就能得到发展。
    北京肥皂产销联营社是京市造胰制碱业中利中、大华、信昌、又新等四家联合组成的。他们在联营以前，已有充分准备，彼此互相了解，联营以后，原四家经理科学分工，各有专责，各尽所长，遇事互相商量；并减少了非生产人员，使工资、伙食、房租、水、电等杂项开支减少了约五分之三，生产成本随之减低了百分之十五；肥皂质量也提高至含皂量达百分之九十五。因之，该社在目前肥皂过剩、全市造胰厂大部赔累的情况下，还始终能有盈余。北京针织联营社是十五家家庭手工针织业联合组成的，也得到了发展。他们在联营前，各自都感到资金短少，很难继续维持。联营后，由于资金集中，减少了不必要的人员，资金虽仍不充裕，但能维持开工。加以产品规格统一，质量也较前提高，因而行销西北，很受欢迎。该社股东过去都是织袜工人，在艰苦中长成，因而彼此之间非常团结，对所集资金，精打细算，除必要开支外，全部用于生产，经理和工人亦一样苦干。经过人民银行贷款扶植，所以生产得到了逐渐发展。
    过去的经验又证明，凡是单纯依赖政府帮助，自身资金短少，又不设法改进经营，提高产品质量的，即使名为“联营”，又节省了开支，也是难以维持而趋向垮台。北京织染业联营社就是一例。该社是京市织染业协盛鑫、公大、庆丰、天龙、信华等五家组成的。在联营之前，五家每月开支共二万七千余斤小米，在联营之后，开支节省了，只需一万余斤小米，而产量却并未减少。在这样好的情况下，应该是发展的，但经营两个月后却垮台了。其原因是：五家工厂中的三家，在联营前已资金耗尽，暂时停工。联营后，五家经理又不尽心经营，遇事互相推诿和观望，且一家拿不出资金，其他几家也不想再拿，只一味以“联营”为招牌，处处想依赖政府帮助，而不图自力更生。另一针织业四家联营的群众工厂，在联营之前，未很好酝酿，条件不成熟就冒然联营。在开工的前一天，才决定工人人数、织袜机数，人事也是草草分配，实际并没人负责。四家经理互相了解不够，各有主张，遇事不研究、不讨论，有的经理并继续经营自己原来的厂子，因而联营之后，开支仍然浩大，仅开办费就浪费了全部资金的三分之一，最后资金耗完，只好歇业。
