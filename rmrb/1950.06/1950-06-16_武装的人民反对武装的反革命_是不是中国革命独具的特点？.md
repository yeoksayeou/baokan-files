　　“Armed People Against Armed Counter-Revolution”
Is it a Unique Feature of the Chinese Revolution? Comrade Huang Zichun:
　　Your letter has been received. After studying the book *The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party* and researching the characteristics of the Chinese Revolution, you believe that Stalin's statement that "the characteristic of the Chinese revolution is armed people against armed counter-revolution" is in line with the historical facts of China. However, you asked: "I am afraid that the revolutions in all countries in the world cannot get rid of this feature. Why didn't Stalin say that this is a characteristic of revolutions in all countries in the world, but described it as a characteristic of the Chinese revolution alone?"
　　Obviously, the characteristic of armed people opposing armed counter-revolution is something that was not present in the revolutions of capitalist countries in the past. This characteristic was first discovered in the people's liberation struggle in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China. However, under certain historical conditions, it can also become a common characteristic of the people's liberation struggle in many colonial and semi-colonial countries.
　　The famous quote from Stalin about China's armed struggle that we all cite was spoken by Stalin in his speech to the China Commission of the Executive Committee of the Communist International on November 30, 1926. This passage is:
　　"In the 18th and 19th centuries, revolutions always started in this way: the people, usually mostly unarmed or poorly armed, revolted, clashed with the army of the old system, trying to disintegrate the old army, or at least partially turn the old army to the side of the people. This was the typical form of past revolutions. The situation in our Russia in 1905 was also like this. But it is different in China. In China, it is not the unarmed people, but the armed people, represented by the revolutionary army, who rise up against the army of the old government. In China, it is armed revolution against armed counter-revolution. This is one of the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, and also one of the advantages of the Chinese revolution. The unique significance of the revolutionary army in China lies here."
　　The reason why this characteristic was first discovered in China is because China was once the largest and most important semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. The enemies of the Chinese people were imperialism and the domestic reactionaries who were dependent on imperialism, who implemented the most brutal military autocracy. And because more than one imperialist country, but many imperialist countries, invaded and ruled China, and they contradicted each other, which made it impossible for the domestic reactionaries to unite, but split and fight each other, which gave the people the convenience of launching and persisting in armed struggle. In the book *The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party*, in the very section you are studying, Comrade Mao Zedong has clearly pointed out: "Faced with such enemies, the method of the Chinese revolution, the main form of the Chinese revolution, cannot be peaceful, but must be armed, which is also determined. Because our enemies do not give the Chinese people the possibility of peaceful activities, the Chinese people have no political freedom. Stalin said: The characteristic of the Chinese revolution is that the armed people oppose the armed counter-revolution, which is an extremely correct provision."
　　In the conclusion of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, that is, "Problems of War and Strategy," Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out in more detail: "In capitalist countries, in the period without fascism and without war, the conditions there are that there is no feudal system within the country, but a bourgeois democratic system; there is no national oppression externally, but their own nation oppresses other nations. Based on these characteristics, the task of the proletarian parties in capitalist countries is to educate the workers, build up strength, and prepare for the final overthrow of capitalism through long-term legal struggles. There, it is a long-term legal struggle, using the parliamentary platform, economic and political strikes, organizing trade unions and educating workers. The organizational form there is legal, and the form of struggle is bloodless (non-war). War for the communists there is a war against the imperialism of their own country. If such a war occurs, the party's policy is to defeat its own country. The war they want is only a domestic war in preparation. However, this war should not be launched until the bourgeoisie is truly incapable, until the majority of the proletariat is determined to armed uprising and wage war, and until the peasant masses have voluntarily assisted the proletariat. When it comes to uprising and war, it is first to occupy the cities and then attack the countryside, and never the other way around. All of these are what the communist parties in capitalist countries have done and have been confirmed in the October Revolution in Russia. China is different. The characteristic of China is that it is not an independent democratic country, but a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. There is no democratic system internally, but is oppressed by the feudal system; there is no national independence externally, but is oppressed by imperialism. Therefore, there is no parliament to use, and no legal right to organize workers to strike. Here, the task of the Communist Party is basically not to enter into riots and wars through long-term legal struggles, nor is it to take the opposite path of first occupying the cities and then taking the countryside." This is a brilliant conclusion drawn by Comrade Mao Zedong on the issue of war and strategy based on the theories of Lenin and Stalin and the experience of the Chinese revolution.
　　The victory of the Chinese people's revolution fully proves the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought. In the past twenty years, those who have made mistakes in the Chinese revolution have mostly done so because they do not understand the laws of Chinese society and the Chinese revolution, and violated Mao Zedong Thought. This is true in politics, and it is also true in military affairs. One of the reasons for the failure of the first domestic revolutionary war in China from 1925 to 1927 was Chen Duxiu's opportunist leadership, which ignored the serious significance of armed struggle. After the failure of this revolution, Chen Duxiu still advocated carrying out legal movements centered on the so-called "National Assembly" under Chiang Kai-shek's reign of terror, and slandered the peasant guerrilla warfare led by the Chinese Communist Party at that time as "bandit" behavior. In this way, Chen Duxiu and his small group of collaborators degenerated into counter-revolutionaries. Those who made "Left" mistakes in the second domestic revolutionary war in China from 1927 to 1936 also underestimated the importance of military struggle, especially peasant guerrilla warfare and rural revolutionary bases, for a period of time. They had mistakenly assumed that the Chinese revolution could rely on developing mass struggles such as urban strikes and school strikes under counter-revolutionary high pressure to achieve victory, rather than relying on developing peasant armed struggles in rural areas where counter-revolutionary forces were relatively sparse to achieve victory. Therefore, they did not subordinate the secret revolutionary work and mass struggles in the cities at that time to the rural armed struggles, but demanded that the rural armed struggles work at that time be subordinated to the secret work and mass struggles in the cities. As a result, not only did the urban work suffer serious failures, but also the rural work suffered losses. If it were not for the correct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms, who overcame the opportunist mistakes of the past, it would be unimaginable for the Chinese revolution to achieve today's victory.
　　This victorious experience of the Chinese Revolution is very important for the people of countries still under the rule of imperialism and its domestic reactionaries. That is to say, the characteristic of armed struggle discovered in the Chinese Revolution, under certain historical conditions, can also become a common characteristic of the people's revolution in other colonial and semi-colonial countries. This has already been explained in the "Theses on the Revolutionary Movement in the Colonies and Semi-Colonies" of the Sixth Congress of the Communist International in August 1928. This outline analyzed "imperialism is still intensifying its preparations for war," "the postwar crisis of world capitalism has occurred," "the socialist construction of the Soviet Union is having a revolutionary impact, and the communist movement in various capitalist countries is increasingly consolidated and is carrying out the struggle to support the people of the colonies." Then, the outline pointed out that "all these conditions have infinitely accelerated the process of political awakening of the broad masses of people in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and have caused many huge mass revolutionary armed uprisings. And in most cases, these mass revolutionary armed uprisings are carried out in the development of the anti-imperialist liberation struggle and the development of domestic class struggle forces in a special combination with each other."
　　In his opening speech at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, based on the experience of the Chinese Revolution and a correct analysis of the political situation after World War II, further clearly pointed out: "The rule of imperialism and its lackeys in the colonies and semi-colonies does not give the people any democratic rights, just as they did in China before. Our revolutionaries were hunted down by imperialism and its lackeys in the cities of White Terror to the point where they could not stand. Our revolutionaries had no choice but to run to the countryside and the mountains to use arms to protect their survival." "In the colonies and semi-colonies, the people have nothing without such arms to protect themselves. The existence and development of the working class organization, the existence and development of the national united front, closely follow the existence and development of such armed struggle. This is the inevitable path for the people of many colonies and semi-colonies to fight for independence and liberation." This fully illustrates that the armed people against the armed counter-revolution is no longer just a unique feature of the Chinese Revolution, but under current conditions, it can and should become a common feature of the people's liberation struggle in many colonies and semi-colonies.
　　The newspaper of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy," published an editorial on January 27 this year, believing that the path of the Chinese people pointed out by Comrade Liu Shaoqi "is the path that the people of many colonial and semi-colonial countries should take to fight for national independence and people's democracy." The editorial of the journal pointed out: "The examples of China, Vietnam, Malaya and other countries show that armed struggle is now becoming the main form of national liberation movement in many colonies and dependent countries." Then, it especially pointed out the significance of the Chinese revolutionary experience for India. After the publication of this editorial, Ranadive, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India, issued a statement expressing "complete acceptance of the conclusion made by the editorial" and said: "The Communist Party of China, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, successfully applied the doctrines of Lenin and Stalin in the victorious Chinese People's Liberation Struggle. The lessons of this victorious Chinese People's Liberation Struggle will be an unmistakable pointer for the Communist Party and the working class of India, which are responsible for leading the national liberation struggle."
　　Armed struggle against imperialist aggression is necessary for the liberation of many colonies and semi-colonies. However, where and when this revolutionary armed struggle should be carried out should be determined according to specific circumstances, and it cannot be carried out unconditionally and without preparation in any colony and semi-colony and at any time. In those countries where objective conditions permit such armed struggle, whether such armed struggle can be victorious depends on whether the people of these countries have the leadership of the working-class party and whether their leadership is correct. The reason why the Chinese people's revolution was able to achieve great victory is because there was the correct political and military line of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao. Now, the Vietnamese people's armed struggle has achieved great results, and in Burma, Malaya, the Philippines and other places, the people's armed struggle is also developing widely. These struggles are being carried out under the leadership of the revolutionary working class of various countries. The people of other colonies and dependent countries, under the intensified oppression and attacks of imperialism and the lackeys of various countries—the reactionaries of various countries—have no "democratic rights," and the illusions of all "legal struggles" are increasingly shattered. Under possible conditions, they will also embark on the road of armed struggle. It can be believed that as long as they have the correct leadership of the working-class party and gain experience from the struggle, the national liberation struggle of these countries will be able to move towards victory.

### “武装的人民反对武装的反革命”是不是中国革命独具的特点？

　　“武装的人民反对武装的反革命”
    是不是中国革命独具的特点？黄子纯同志：
    来信收到了。你们学习《中国革命与中国共产党》一书，研究了中国革命的特点之后，认为斯大林所说的“中国革命的特点是武装的人民反对武装的反革命”是合乎中国的历史事实的。但是，你们问道：“恐怕世界各国革命也脱离不了这一特点。为什么斯大林不说这是世界上各国革命的特点，而单独说成中国革命的特点呢？”
    很明显的，武装的人民反对武装的反革命，这个特点，是过去时期资本主义各国革命中所没有的。这个特点，是在半殖民地、半封建的中国人民解放斗争中首先被发现的。但是，在一定的历史条件下，它又可以成为许多殖民地、半殖民地国家的人民解放斗争的共通的特点。
    我们大家所引证的斯大林关于中国武装斗争的名言，是斯大林在一九二六年十一月三十日在共产国际执委会中国委员会上的演说中所讲的。这一段话是：
    “在十八世纪和十九世纪，革命总是这样开始的，就是通常总是大部分没有武装或是武装很坏的人民举行起义，与旧制度的军队发生冲突，力谋瓦解旧的军队，或者至少部分地使旧军队转到人民的方面来。这是过去革命爆发的典型的形式。一九○五年在我们俄国的情形，也是这样。在中国却不然了。在中国，不是没有武装的人民，而是以革命军队为代表的武装的人民，起来反对旧政府的军队。在中国，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命。这是中国革命的特点之一，也是中国革命的优点之一。革命军队在中国的独特的意义也在这里。”
    这个特点之所以首先发现于中国，就因为中国曾是一个最大的和最重要的半殖民地、半封建的国度。中国人民的敌人是帝国主义和依附帝国主义的国内反动派，他们实行了最残暴的军事专制。并且由于侵略与统治中国的不只一个帝国主义国家，而是许多帝国主义国家，它们互相矛盾，因而也就使国内的反动派不能统一，而互相分裂，互相斗争，就给了人民以发动和坚持武装斗争的便利条件。在《中国革命与中国共产党》一书上，就在你们正在研究的那一节文字中，毛泽东同志已经明白地指出：“在这样的敌人面前，中国革命的方法，中国革命的主要形式，不能是和平的，而必须是武装的，也就决定了。因为我们的敌人不给中国人民以和平活动的可能，中国人民没有任何的政治自由。斯大林说：中国革命的特点是武装的人民反对武装的反革命，这是异常正确的规定。”
    毛泽东同志在中共六届六中全会结论之一部，即“战争与战略问题”中，曾经更详细地指出：“在资本主义各国，在没有法西斯与没有战争的时期内，那里的条件是国家内部没有了封建制度，有的是资产阶级的民主制度；外部没有民族压迫，有的是自己民族压迫别的民族。基于这些特点，资本主义各国无产阶级政党的任务，在于经过长期的合法斗争，教育工人，生息力量，准备最后推翻资本主义。在那里，是长期的合法斗争，是利用议会讲坛，是经济的与政治的罢工，是组织工会与教育工人。那里的组织形式是合法的，斗争形式是不流血的（非战争的）。战争对于那里的共产党，是反对自己国家的帝国主义战争。如果这种战争发生了，党的政策是使自己国家败北。自己所要的战争只是准备中的国内战争。但是这种战争，不到资产阶级处于真正无能之时，不到无产阶级的大多数有了武装起义与进行战争的决心之时，不到农民群众已经自愿援助无产阶级之时，起义与战争是不应该举行的。到了起义与战争时，又是首先占领城市，然后进攻乡村，而决不能相反。所有这些，都是资本主义国家的共产党所曾经这样做而在俄国的十月革命中证实了的。中国则不同。中国的特点是：不是一个独立的民主的国家，而是一个半殖民地半封建的国家。对内没有民主制度，而受封建制度压迫；对外没有民族独立，而受帝国主义压迫。因此，无议会可以利用，无组织工人举行罢工的合法权。在这里，共产党的任务，基本地不是经过长期合法斗争以进入暴动与战争，也不是先占城市后取乡村，而是走的相反的道路。”这是毛泽东同志根据列宁、斯大林的理论和中国革命的经验，对战争与战略问题所作的精辟的结论。
    中国人民革命的胜利，完全证明了毛泽东思想的正确。过去二十余年间，在中国革命中犯了错误的人，大都是因为他们不了解中国社会和中国革命的规律，违背了毛泽东的思想。在政治上是如此，在军事上也是如此。一九二五年至一九二七年的中国第一次国内革命战争失败的原因之一，就是陈独秀的机会主义领导，忽视了武装斗争的严重意义。陈独秀在这次革命失败以后，仍主张在蒋介石恐怖统治下进行以所谓“国民会议”为中心口号的合法运动，并且诬蔑当时中国共产党所领导的农民游击战争为“流寇”行为。这样，陈独秀及其一小群合作者就堕落为反革命。在一九二七年至一九三六年中国第二次国内革命战争中犯过左倾错误的人，也曾在一个时期内低估了军事斗争，特别是农民游击战争和乡村革命根据地的重要性。他们曾经错误地设想中国革命可以依靠在反革命高压下发展城市罢工罢课等群众斗争来得到胜利，而不是依靠在反革命力量比较稀薄的乡村中发展农民武装斗争来得到胜利，因此他们不把当时的城市秘密革命工作和城市群众斗争服从于乡村武装斗争，而要求当时的乡村武装斗争工作服从于城市秘密工作和城市群众斗争。其结果，不但使城市工作遭受严重失败，而且使乡村工作受到损失。如果不是由于毛泽东同志及其战友们的正确领导，克服了历次的机会主义的错误，中国革命要取得今天的胜利，是不可想象的。
    中国革命的这一胜利的经验，对于尚在帝国主义及其国内反动派统治下的国家的人民是很重要的经验。这就是说，在中国革命中被发现的武装斗争这个特点，在一定的历史条件下，又可以成为其他殖民地和半殖民地各国人民革命的共通的特点。这在一九二八年八月共产国际第六次大会“关于殖民地及半殖民地革命运动的提纲”中，业已有所说明。这个提纲分析了“帝国主义还继续加紧准备着战争”，“世界资本主义发生了战后的危机”，“苏联社会主义建设发生着革命化的影响，以及各资本主义国家内共产主义运动日益巩固起来，并进行着拥护殖民地人民的斗争”。接着，提纲指出“所有这些条件，都无限量地加速了殖民地和半殖民地国家里广大民众政治觉醒的过程，引起了许多巨大的群众革命武装起义。而且在大多数情形中，这些群众革命武装起义，都是在反帝解放斗争的发展，和国内阶级斗争力量的发展，彼此密切的特殊的配合中进行的。”
    刘少奇同志在亚洲澳洲工会代表会议的开幕词中，根据中国革命的经验和对第二次世界大战以后的政治形势的正确分析，进一步明确地指出：“帝国主义及其走狗在殖民地半殖民地的统治，不给人民以任何民主权利，譬如它们在以前的中国就是这样。我们革命者在白色恐怖的城市被帝国主义及其走狗追捕到完全不能立足，我们革命者就不能不跑到乡村和山上去用武装来保护自己的生存。”“在殖民地半殖民地，人民如果没有这样的武装来保护自己，就没有人民的一切。工人阶级组织的存在和发展，民族统一战线的存在和发展，是紧跟着这样的武装斗争的存在和发展的。这是许多殖民地半殖民地人民争取独立和解放的不可避免的道路。”这就完全说明了，武装的人民反对武装的反革命，这已经不仅仅是中国革命所曾经独具的特点，而在现时的条件下，它可以也应该成为许多殖民地半殖民地人民解放斗争的共通的特点了。
    共产党和工人党情报局的机关报“争取持久和平争取人民民主”在今年一月二十七日发表社论，认为刘少奇同志所指出的中国人民的道路，“是许多殖民地半殖民地国家的人民争取民族独立和人民民主所应该走的道路”。该刊社论指出：“中国、越南、马来亚和其他国家的例子，说明了武装斗争现在正成为许多殖民地与附属国民族解放运动的主要形式。”接着特别指出了中国革命经验对于印度的意义。在这篇社论发表以后，印度共产党总书记兰那地夫曾发表声明表示“完全接受该社论所作的结论”，并且说：“由毛泽东同志领导的中国共产党，在胜利的中国人民解放斗争中，成功地运用了列宁与斯大林的学说。这种胜利的中国人民解放斗争的教训，对于在民族解放斗争中担负领导任务的印度共产党和工人阶级，将是一个绝不会错的指针。”
    反抗帝国主义侵略的武装斗争，对于许多殖民地半殖民地的解放是必需的。但是这种革命的武装斗争，究竟应该在什么地方和什么时候来进行，那要根据具体情况来决定，并不是在任何殖民地半殖民地和在任何时候都可以无条件无准备地来进行的。如果在客观条件方面允许进行这种武装斗争的那些国家中，这种武装斗争是否能得到胜利，在主观条件方面就决定于这些国家的人民有没有工人阶级政党的领导和他们的领导是否正确。中国人民革命之所以能取得伟大的胜利，即是因为有了以毛主席为首的中国共产党的正确的政治路线和军事路线。现在，越南人民武装斗争已经取得了巨大的成绩，在缅甸、马来亚、菲律宾等地，人民的武装斗争也正在广泛地发展着，这些斗争都是在各国的革命的工人阶级领导下进行的。其他各殖民地及附属国的人民，在帝国主义及其各国的走狗——各国反动派的加紧压迫与进攻之下，没有“民主权利”，一切“合法斗争”的幻想日益破灭，他们在可能条件下也将走上武装斗争的道路。可以相信，只要他们有了工人阶级政党的正确领导，并从斗争中获得了经验，这些国家的民族解放斗争就能够走向胜利。
