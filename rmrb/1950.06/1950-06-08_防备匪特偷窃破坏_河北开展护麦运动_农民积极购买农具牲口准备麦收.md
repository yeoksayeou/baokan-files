　　To Guard Against Bandit and Special Agent Theft and Sabotage

    Hebei Launches Wheat Protection Movement

    Farmers Actively Purchase Farm Tools and Livestock to Prepare for Wheat Harvest

    [Report from our newspaper in Baoding] The broad masses of farmers in Hebei Province are currently launching a mass wheat protection movement and vigorously preparing for the wheat harvest. Last year, the province planted 36,820,000 mu of wheat, accounting for about one-third of the total cultivated land area. Although some areas experienced wheat diseases and pests this year, the majority of the wheat crop is growing well thanks to the active prevention and control efforts led by governments at all levels, and the total output is still expected to exceed last year's.

    However, as the wheat ripens, incidents of stealing and damaging wheat fields have occurred continuously in some places. For example, in Xia’aili and Dafang villages in Yi County, six mu of wheat fields belonging to three households, including Wu Hengde's, were stolen between May 13th and 21st. Incidents of damaging wheat fields have also been discovered in counties such as Jianguo and Wuqiang. In order to protect the fruits of farmers' labor and prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents, the Hebei Provincial People's Government and the Hebei Provincial Military Region issued instructions on May 17th to protect the wheat harvest, ordering governments and armed departments at all levels to launch a mass wheat protection movement, primarily involving the militia, public security teams, and stationed troops. The instructions also called on the masses to make all preparations before the wheat harvest so that they can harvest immediately after it ripens.

    After the instructions were issued, all localities held cadre meetings around May 20th to determine wheat protection measures. The county and district level anti-banditry and public security committees serve as the leading institutions for carrying out wheat protection work. Counties and districts that have not established anti-banditry and public security committees have established wheat protection committees. Each village has established a wheat protection committee led by the village head, militia captain, and public security officer. Various localities have also sent cadres to the countryside to assist village cadres in educating the masses about wheat protection, dispelling the complacency of some people who believe that "now that things are stable, no one will come to sabotage." The masses have now voluntarily formed wheat protection groups according to the distance of the wheat fields, formulated wheat protection covenants, and villages have established joint defense, with the militia as the backbone, to protect the wheat in the fields. Those who have stolen wheat in the past are being educated and reformed. For example, Zhang Cuierzhuang in Jianguo gathered Zhang Shuxing and other six people from the village who had stolen wheat in the past, educated them, and then helped them organize a contracting team to work for households in the village with no labor or with more wheat.

    Various localities are now preparing for the wheat harvest. In order to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power, many areas have begun to rectify and organize mutual aid and purchase summer harvest tools and livestock. For example, in Zhang Cuierzhuang in Jianguo, 125 out of 142 households in the village have been organized. Fuxi Village in the Third District of Jize County purchased and repaired 800 various summer harvest farm tools. In Nanguan Village in Raoyang County, 23 households added 51 farm tools and purchased nine head of cattle. Farmers in other areas such as Wei County and Nangong have also purchased many farm tools.

　　防备匪特偷窃破坏
    河北开展护麦运动
    农民积极购买农具牲口准备麦收
    【本报保定讯】河北省广大农民，现正掀起群众性护麦运动，并大力进行麦收准备。该省去年种麦三千六百八十二万亩，约占总耕地面积的三分之一。今年部分地区小麦虽有病虫灾害，但经各级人民政府领导农民积极防治，大部麦子成长良好，其总产量仍可超过去年。
    但在麦子将熟之时，有些地方曾连续发生偷割与毁坏麦田的事件。如易县下隘利、大方两村吴恒的等三户，在五月十三日至二十一日，麦田被偷割掉六亩。建国、武强等县亦发现毁坏麦田的事情。为了保卫农民劳动成果，防止匪特破坏，河北省人民政府、河北省军区曾于五月十七日发出保卫麦收指示，令各级政府及武装部门，以民兵、公安队、驻军为主，开展群众性的护麦运动。该指示并号召群众在麦收前做好一切准备工作，以便在成熟之后立即收割。
    指示下达后，各地在五月二十日前后，都召开了干部会议，确定护麦措施。各县、区均以清剿治安委员会为进行护麦工作的领导机构，未建立清剿治安委员会的县、区，则成立护麦委员会。各村以村长、民兵队长、公安员为主，组成护麦委员会。各地还派出干部下乡，协助村干部对群众进行护麦教育，打破了部分群众认为“现在安定了，没有人来破坏”的麻痹思想。现群众已纷纷自动按麦地远近，结成护麦小组，订出护麦公约，各村亦已建立联防，以民兵为骨干下地护麦。对于过去曾偷过麦子的人，则进行教育改造。如建国张崔尔庄，把本村过去曾偷盗过麦子的张淑兴等六人召集在一块，进行了教育，然后帮助他们组织了一个包工组，给村里无劳力户或麦子多的户包工。
    现各地正在进行麦收的准备工作，不少地区为解决劳力、畜力不足的困难，已着手整顿与组织互助，购买夏收工具和牲口等。如建国张崔尔庄，全村一百四十二户，已有一百二十五户组织起来。鸡泽县三区浮西村购买与修理各种夏收农具达八百件，饶阳县南关村二十三户，就添制农具五十一件，购买耕牛九头，其他魏县、南宫等地农民亦添购农具很多。
