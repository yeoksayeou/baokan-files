　　Seventh District People's Representative Conference Concludes

　　District Chief Han and others report on the opinions regarding the review of proposals to expose undesirable work styles of government staff, which were met with satisfaction by representatives from all sectors.

　　[Beijing News Agency Report] The Seventh District People's Representative Conference, lasting three days, concluded yesterday (8th). The main agenda of yesterday's meeting was to examine the work style of government staff. Government staff conducted self-criticism at the meeting, and representatives offered sincere opinions, with both criticism and praise in their speeches. The atmosphere of the meeting fully demonstrated harmony, democracy, and camaraderie.

　　The conference received a total of 162 proposals regarding the work style of government staff. These proposals mainly exposed the bureaucracy and commandism of some cadres, as well as individual cases of corruption and violations of discipline. First, Han Linguang, District Chief of the Seventh District, and Mu Fu, Chief of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau's Outer Sub-bureau, reported on the opinions regarding the review of these proposals. They believed that the opinions raised by the representatives were generally consistent with the actual situation. Some individual situations had not been discovered by the government, and the exposure by the representatives was of great help to the government. They also explained that the government had continuously conducted serious criticism and struggle against those undesirable work styles and corrupt and degenerate criminal behaviors, and had taken educational reforms or legal actions according to the nature of the mistakes and the severity of the circumstances. For example, Wang Fuxing, the head of the Fourth Retail Store Working Group, and his group of six people were collectively corrupt, selling flour with short weights. In addition to being dismissed from his position, Wang Fuxing has been sentenced to three years in prison by the court, and the others have also been sentenced to prison terms and ordered to return the embezzled funds. Some staff members, eager for quick results, made the mistake of commandism. Although the starting point was for the benefit of the masses, the improper approach aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. This work style must also be corrected. They believed that the continuous occurrence of these things was due to the bureaucratic mistakes of the heads of government departments, who failed to conduct in-depth inspections, listen to the opinions of the masses, and correct them in a timely manner, resulting in unnecessary losses in the work. They hoped that the representatives would offer more opinions so that the government's work could be greatly improved.

　　After the reports, the representatives took to the stage to speak one after another, unanimously expressing satisfaction with the opinions on the review and handling of the proposals. They said that the vast majority of government staff are good, working actively, living frugally, and serving the people sincerely. Only a few made the mistake of commandism in promoting their work, and a small number of individuals were tainted with the Kuomintang style, corruption, and degeneration. The government does not shield or cover up these people, but boldly exposes them or allows the people to report them. This is only possible under the people's government led by the Communist Party. Some representatives excitedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" During their speeches, the representatives continued to expose some staff members with improper work styles. These straightforward, frank, and well-intentioned speeches often elicited warm applause from the entire audience. Finally, District Chief Han Linguang, on behalf of the government, expressed sincere acceptance of these opinions.

　　During the meeting, more than 30 representatives jointly proposed writing a letter to Chairman Mao to report on the proceedings of the meeting, which was enthusiastically approved by the congress. After Representative Song Ruifen delivered the closing remarks on behalf of the presidium, the congress concluded with shouts of slogans.

　　七区各界人民代表会议闭幕
    韩区长等报告对于检举政府工作人员不良作风的提案审查意见，各界代表均表满意。
    【京市新闻处讯】第七区各界人民代表会议，历时三日，于昨（八）日闭幕。昨日会议的主要议程是检查政府工作人员作风，政府工作人员在会上进行了自我批评，代表们诚恳地提出了意见，发言时有批评也有表扬。会场充分表现和谐、民主、友爱的气氛。
    会议收到关于政府工作人员作风的提案共一百六十二件。这些提案主要是检举一些干部的官僚主义，强迫命令的作风和个别的贪污腐化、违反纪律的行为。首由第七区区长韩林光和公安局外三分局局长慕弗分别报告对这些提案审查的意见，认为代表们所提的意见一般都是合乎实际情况的，有些个别情形政府尚未发觉，现在由代表们检举出来，对政府的帮助很大。他们并且说明政府曾经不断地向那些不良的作风和贪污腐化的犯罪行为进行严肃的批评和斗争，并根据错误的性质及情节的轻重，分别加以教育改造或依法处办。如第四零售店工作组长王福兴和他的小组六人集体贪污，用小秤卖面，除撤职以外，王福兴已由法院判处徒刑三年，其余的也分别判处徒刑并追还贪污款项。有些工作人员急于求成，犯了强迫命令的毛病，虽然出发点是为了群众的利益，但由于作法不对，反而惹起群众不满，这种作风也必须纠正的。他们认为这些事情的不断发生，是由于政府各部门负责人犯了官僚主义的毛病，没有深入检查，听取群众的意见，及时加以纠正，致使工作遭受不必要的损失。他们希望代表们多提意见，使政府的工作能有大的改进。
    报告以后，代表们纷纷登台发言，对提案审查和处理的意见一致表示满意，他们说政府绝大多数的工作人员都是好的，工作积极，生活艰苦，诚心诚意的为人民服务，只有少数在推动工作时犯了强迫命令的毛病，少数的个别的沾染了国民党作风，贪污腐化，政府对这些人不包庇，不掩饰，大胆地把他们揭露出来，或者由人民检举，这只有在共产党领导下的人民政府才能够这样做。有些代表非常激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”在发言时，代表们并继续检举一些作风不正的工作人员，这些率直、坦白而且善意的发言，时常引起全场热烈的鼓掌。最后由韩林光区长代表政府对这些意见表示诚恳地接受。
    在会议进行中，有三十几个代表联名提议给毛主席写信报告会议经过，经大会热烈鼓掌通过。宋汝棼代表主席团致闭幕词之后，大会在高呼口号声中结束。
