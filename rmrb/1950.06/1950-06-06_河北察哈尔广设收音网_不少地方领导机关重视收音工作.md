　　Hebei and Chahar Establish Extensive Radio Networks
    Leadership Organs in Many Places Emphasize Radio Reception Work
    Fully Utilize Radio Broadcasting for Mass Propaganda and Education!
    [This Newspaper's Report] Radio reception networks in Hebei and Chahar provinces have been organized, and radio reception work has already made contributions and received attention.
    In Hebei province, out of more than 120 counties, the vast majority of counties, except for a few where radio reception work is still incomplete, can guarantee to record and organize listening to important programs from the Baoding station on time. All 32 counties and cities and three special districts in Chahar province have also set up professional radio operators. In Hebei, the records of radio operators are submitted to the local leading organs, and in some areas, these records are used as the main content of blackboard newspapers and rooftop broadcasts. The relationship between radio operators and broadcasting stations in various counties is also becoming closer. In the past two months, the Baoding station has received 237 reports from 90 units in various special zones, cities, and counties, with almost every county providing timely listening and situation reports. In Hebei province, the radio reception work in Tangshan and Baoding special districts has been done relatively well. Orders, instructions, and notices from various provincial-level organs in Chahar are quickly disseminated to counties and even districts through radio operators every day, greatly strengthening administrative efficiency. More than two-thirds of the radio operators also manage local blackboard newspapers, reporting important news to the masses in a timely manner.
    Timely listening to the radio is of great help in completing various tasks.
    From letters from leading organs and radio operators in various counties in Hebei, one can see the contribution of broadcasting and radio reception work. The Rongcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party said in a letter: "We are preparing for the three-level elections, conducting propaganda and deliberation, and holding expanded cadre meetings to discuss and arrange this work. After copying the key points of village election propaganda, we immediately discussed and studied them, and printed 150 copies, which were immediately distributed to the villages to carry out propaganda and mobilization work based on these key points. The next day, we copied the introduction of the experience of the Mancheng County village election demonstration and introduced it at the meeting. After the village election began, we copied the experience of the Andong village election and immediately printed it for the reference of various districts, which played a great role; waiting to see the newspaper would not be timely." Changli County, which is very close to the railway line, also said in its report: "The instructions and experience introduction for spring plowing work in April, the notice on planting cotton, and the agricultural department's method of controlling wheat jaundice (this disease was found in our county's fifth district), etc., have all played a significant role in guiding and promoting our county's spring plowing and other work." At the levee repair conference held in Yutian County on March 17, the provincial government's circular on the experience and lessons learned from Anci County's mobilization of migrant workers to repair the levee, received on the 16th, was read out in public, enabling the local levee repair work to absorb many valuable experiences in a timely manner. Radio operators in Chahar province sometimes also organize the masses to listen to the radio, such as in Wanquan, organizing local workers to listen to speeches by Sun Ming, chairman of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and others on May 1st. From April 14th to April 20th, the special program "Preventing the Resurgence of Plague in Chahar Province," sponsored by the Zhangjiakou station and the Chahar Provincial Health Bureau, was organized by various counties for medical and health workers and students to listen to. After listening, the masses in Wanquan, led by the Yangko team of elementary schools, civil schools, and women's literacy classes, carried out street propaganda and immediately restored the organization of the epidemic prevention committee, and all cadres and organized masses were fully vaccinated. After listening, cadres and masses in Zhuolu County also carried out cleaning and sanitation work throughout the city.
    In addition, the broadcast's daily transmission of urgent instructions and notices, and reports on market conditions and quotations, have also played a significant role in the work of Party and government organs, as well as trade companies and banks in various places.
    On March 25th, Chairman Yang of the Hebei Provincial Government gave a summary report at the closing of the provincial economic conference, and the Baoding station broadcast it live to the entire province. In just 21 counties, 796 cadres were organized to listen. Radio operators in Chahar province also paid special attention to organizing cadres to listen to the social science lectures on the Central Station and the "Voice of Provincial Politics" on the Chahar Provincial Station (i.e., Zhangjiakou Station). Copying records of news from the provincial station, collecting various problems in the work, study, and life of the listeners, and reporting the listeners' opinions on broadcasting to the broadcasting station, combined with local mimeographed newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and rooftop broadcasts, is used to further promote broadcasting.
    Having experienced the benefits of recording broadcasts, various places have gradually attached importance to this work.
    The radio reception work in many counties has begun to receive attention because of its contributions. Various departments of the Hebei Provincial Government and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, etc., have provided the radio station with more convenience. Of the 58 directive-bearing manuscripts broadcast by the Baoding station in April from various provincial-level organs, 29 were earlier than the written documents, and 14 were sent to the radio station on the same day as the written documents, making it possible for the radio station to transmit the documents in a timely manner. In order to facilitate radio reception work, the Tangshan Special District specially established a "Radio Materials Supply Cooperative" to be responsible for repairing radios and manufacturing dry batteries, and to supply them to various counties on a regular and quantitative basis, which both saves money and guarantees listening. In order to protect radios and facilitate listening, the Tangshan Special District also specially set up radio rooms for radio operators. The Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also issued two documents in March, "Circular on Radio Reception Work in Luannan" and "Instructions on Strengthening Radio Reception Work," which comprehensively improved the radio reception work in various counties in the Special District. The importance attached by the leading organs and the active responsibility of the radio operators are the two main factors for the relatively good radio reception work in the Tangshan Special District.
    Radio operators in various places use blackboard newspapers and other means to disseminate recorded content.
    In addition to managing local blackboard newspapers, radio operators in Chahar province, some county radio operators also publish their small newspapers. Youyu publishes "Broadcasting Express," Xuanhua publishes "Production Small Newspaper," Hunyuan publishes "Passing the Time," Chicheng publishes "Exchange," and Huade publishes "People's Broadcasting." Hunyuan publishes "News Broadcasting," which is not only posted in the county but also distributed to districts and villages. The news of the victory on Hainan Island was posted on blackboard newspapers in various counties. Zhuolu County temporarily organized 63 blackboard newspapers, and the red and green characters attracted the attention of the villagers. After copying this good news, radio operators in Hunyuan, Yingxian, Wanquan, Yuxian, Zhuolu, Guangling, Lingqiu, Shangdu, and other counties immediately notified various organs and launched street propaganda.
    Some radio operators are no longer satisfied with the small circle of purely recording work. In addition to publishing small newspapers and organizing blackboard newspapers, eight good radio operators have organized 20 broadcasting communication groups to report the situation in various places to the broadcasting station in a timely manner and supply manuscripts, mainly reporting on agricultural production. Hunyuan, Lingqiu, and Zhuolu also organized listening groups according to different departments. Now Lingqiu has four groups, each with ten people; Hunyuan has ten groups, each with six people; and Zhuolu has four groups, each with thirteen or fourteen people. As radio reception work gradually unfolds, the masses have come into contact with the broadcasting station, positive activists in listening have emerged, and the role and importance of broadcasting have been transformed from the propaganda of the radio station into the actual experience of the masses themselves.

　　河北察哈尔广设收音网
    不少地方领导机关重视收音工作
    充分利用无线电广播进行群众性宣传教育！
    【本报讯】河北、察哈尔两省广播收音网已经组织起来，收音工作已有了贡献并受到重视。
    河北全省一百二十多个县中，除个别几个县的收音工作还不健全之外，绝大多数的县份都能保证按时记录和组织收听保定台的重要节目。察哈尔全省三十二个县、市和三个专署也都设置了专业的收音员。在河北各地收音员的记录都交给当地的领导机关，一部分地区并将这些记录作了黑板报和屋顶广播的主要内容。各县的收音员和广播台的关系也日趋密切，最近两个月，保定台一共收到各专区、市、县九十个单位的收听汇报二百三十七封，几乎每县都作了及时的收听和情况报告。在河北全省中，唐山专区和保定专区的收音工作，做得比较好。察哈尔各省级机关的命令、指示和通知，每天通过收音员迅速下达到县甚至区，大大加强了行政的效率。有三分之二以上的收音员，还掌握了当地的黑板报，及时地向群众报导各项重要的消息。
    及时收听广播，对完成各项工作有很大帮助。
    从河北各县领导机关和收音员的信件中，可以看到广播和收音工作的贡献。容城县中共县委会在信上说：“我们正在筹备三级选举，进行宣传、酝酿，召开扩大干部会，讨论布置这一工作。在抄收了村选宣传要点之后，立即进行讨论研究，并油印了一百五十份，马上发到村，根据这个要点展开宣传动员工作。第二天又抄收了满城县村选示范的经验介绍，又在会上作了介绍。村选开始后，又抄到安东村选经验，马上油印发各区参考，起了很大作用，等着看报就不及时。”离铁路线很近的昌黎县在报告上也说：“四月份春耕工作的指示和经验介绍、种棉的通知、农业厅除治小麦黄疸的办法（我县五区发现这个病害）等，对我县春耕等工作的指导与推动起作用都很大。”玉田县在三月十七日召开的修堤大会上，把十六日收到的省府关于安次县动员民工修堤经验教训的通报，当众宣读，使当地的修堤工作能及时地吸收许多宝贵的经验。察哈尔省收音员有时也组织群众收听，如万全在五一节组织当地工人听省工会主席孙明等的讲话，四月十四日到四月二十日张家口台和察省卫生局主办的“防治察省鼠疫再起”的特别节目，各县都组织医务卫生工作人员和学生等收听。万全群众收听后，由小学、民校和妇女识字班的秧歌队出发作街头宣传，并立即恢复了防疫委员会的组织，机关干部和有组织的群众都完全进行了注射。涿鹿干部群众收听后，也在全城进行了清洁卫生工作。
    此外，广播每日对紧急指示和通知的传达，对行情和牌价的报告，对于各地党、政机关以及贸易公司和银行的工作，也起了很大作用。
    三月二十五日河北省府杨主席在省经济会议闭幕时的总结报告，保定台向全省作了实况转播。仅是二十一个县份中，就组织了七百九十六个干部收听。察省收音员也特别注意组织机关干部收听中央台的社会科学讲座和察哈尔省台（即张家口台）的“省政之声”。抄收省台记录新闻、搜集听众工作、学习、生活上的各种问题，连同听众对广播的意见向广播台汇报，并结合当地油印报、黑板报、屋顶广播，做广播的再宣传。
    体验到收录广播的好处，各地已逐渐重视这一工作。
    许多县的收音工作，因为有了贡献，开始受到重视。河北省府各部门和中共河北省委等，已给予广播电台以较多的便利。保定台四月份播送的各省级机关五十八篇带指示性的稿件中，有二十九篇比行文早，有十四篇是在行文当天送给广播台，使广播台有可能将该项文件及时传达下去。唐山专区为便利收音工作，特地成立了“电料供应社”，负责修理收音机和制造干电池，定时定量地供给各县，既节约又保证了收听。唐山专区为保护收音机和便利收听，又特为收音员设置收音室。唐山中共地委三月份也先后发出《关于滦南收音工作的通报》和《关于加强收音工作的指示》两个文件，使专区各县的收音工作，有了全面的改进。唐山专区收音工作之所以做得比较好，领导机关的重视和收音员的积极负责，是两个主要的因素。
    各地收音员利用黑板报等传播收录内容。
    察省收音员除掌握当地的黑板报外，一部分县的收音员还出版他们的小报。右玉出版《广播快报》，宣化出版《生产小报》，浑源出版《过光景》，赤城出版了《交流》，化德出版《人民广播》。浑源出版《新闻广播》，除在县张贴外，还发行到区、村。海南岛胜利的消息在各县都上了黑板报。涿鹿县临时组织了六十三块黑板报，红绿大字吸引了老乡们的注意。浑源、应县、万全、蔚县、涿鹿、广灵、灵邱、商都等县的收音员，在抄收了这一捷报之后，立刻通知各机关，并且展开街头宣传。
    有一部分收音员已不满足于单纯的录音工作的小圈子。除开出版小报与组织黑板报而外，有八个好的收音员组织了二十个广播通讯小组，及时地向广播台反映各地的情况和供给稿件，主要是报告农业生产的情况。浑源、灵邱、涿鹿还按不同部门组织收听小组，现在灵邱有四个小组，每组十人；浑源十个小组，每组六人；涿鹿四个组，每组十三四人。由于收音工作逐渐展开，群众与广播台发生联系了，收听的积极分子出现了，广播的作用和重要性，也已由电台的宣传变成了群众自己的实际经验。
