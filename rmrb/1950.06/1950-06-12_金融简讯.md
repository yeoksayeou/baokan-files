    Yanggao Branch of the People's Bank Inspects Agricultural Loans
    This spring, the Yanggao Branch of the People's Bank issued a total of 379,100 jin of millet in agricultural loans, which solved most of the difficulties in production for the masses. It enabled 443 peasant households in 120 villages in the county to purchase 296 additional draught animals, cultivating a total of 31,775 mu of land. The assistance to disaster victims was even greater. However, inspections revealed serious instances of loans being used for unintended purposes. For example, the branch secretary of Gezhishan in the seventh district, the director of the Women's Federation in Xiguan Street in the first district, and others ate and drank 1,200 jin of borrowed grain and did not use it for production. Other similar situations were numerous.

    Jiaocheng Branch of the People's Bank Submits False Reports
    In May, the Fenyang Office of the People's Bank focused on inspecting the spring loans of the Jiaocheng Branch and found that the branch's reports did not match the actual situation. For example, in Chengtou, Qingcun, and Yangquan villages, loans were given to repair 21 wells, but only 3 have been repaired, and 1 is still under repair, while the branch reported that all have been fully repaired. There were also serious discrepancies in loans for breeding livestock and land medicine. The branch only completed 91 percent of its spring loan task by the end of April, but reported that it had been successfully completed.

    人民银行阳高支行检查农贷
    人民银行阳高支行今春共发放农贷小米三十七万九千一百多斤，为群众解决了生产中的大部困难。使全县一百二十个村的四百四十三户农民，增购了耕畜二百九十六头，共耕种了土地三万一千七百七十五亩。对灾民的帮助更大。但经检查结果，也曾经有严重的贷非所用的现象发生。如七区阁志山支书、一区西关街妇联主任等将一千二百斤贷粮都吃、喝光，并未用在生产上。其他类似情形还不少。

    人民银行交城支行作假报告
    人民银行汾阳办事处，于五月份，重点检查交城支行春贷，发现支行报告与实际不符，如城头、青村、阳泉三村，共贷款修井二十一眼，现修复仅三眼，一眼尚在修理，而该行却报告已全部修复。其他种畜、地药贷款亦均有严重的偏差。该行四月底春贷任务本来只完成百分之九十一，而却报告已圆满结束。
