　　Gorky—A Warrior for Peace
　　——Commemorating the Fourteenth Anniversary of Gorky's Death
　　Xiao San

　　"Gorky lived to his last breath with the same feelings and thoughts as those who are now, under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, so enthusiastically building a new socialist society. His eyes, until the very end of his life, flashed with the light of struggle and hatred for the enemies of the working people, for the fascists, for all other oppressors, for the suffocators of culture and the instigators of war... Gorky's example teaches us many things," Molotov once said.

　　Today, in the high tide of tens of millions of kind and upright people worldwide resolutely defending world peace and opposing wars of aggression, one cannot help but think of this passionate warrior—Gorky—who devoted his life to fighting for freedom, democracy, and socialism, for truth, and for peace.

　　Gorky's letter "To the Masters of Culture" remains as powerful today as it was then. In this day and age where the Anglo-American imperialist bloc is frantically instigating a new human massacre, Gorky's saying that "capitalists are dangerous elements in society" seems even more sharp and accurate.

　　Gorky spared no effort in exposing the crimes of imperialism and the decadent culture of the bourgeois West. He tore off the masks of the war instigators and their running dogs—the social democrats. He pointed out that warmongers want to build gold mountains in the sea of human blood. The great writer opposed the hypocrisy of "Pacifism" and exposed the deception of the Second International leaders against the people of Europe.

　　Gorky had long seen the ugly and ferocious features of the American imperialists. More than twenty years ago (1929), when he answered a question from an American magazine about American civilization, he said:

　　"I think your civilization is the ugliest civilization on our planet, because it terribly magnifies all the various and shameful ugliness of European civilization."

　　Reading this sentence today makes it feel even more vivid. How accurately the revolutionary and humanitarian Gorky described the American imperialism of today!

　　Gorky wrote many reportage pieces while in the United States. These articles exposed the sinful essence of capitalist imperialism. Articles such as "The City of the Yellow Devil," "The High Priest of Morality," and "The Kingdom of Loneliness" denounced the greed of American billionaires for the "yellow devil"—gold, and the capitalist "morality" that binds the working people and protects the profits of the capitalists as "etiquette."

　　"The faces of the people are cold—as if no one feels the misfortune of being a slave... There are many energetic faces, but on each face, one sees teeth first. (As for) inner freedom, spiritual freedom, it does not flicker in people's eyes. And this energy without freedom reminds one of the cold light of a knife that has not yet been dulled. This is the freedom of a blind tool in the hands of the yellow devil—gold."

　　Reading this passage from "The City of the Yellow Devil," we can also see a glimpse of the ugliness of American civilization.

　　Gorky turned the "culture" of the United States inside out. He wrote about the tragic fate of African Americans, believing that the theory of racial discrimination was a shameful phenomenon of the twentieth century. He ridiculed the face of the "Goddess of Liberty" statue in New York Harbor as cold, its eyes blind, and the torch in its hand unable to emit light, because there is no true freedom in the United States.

　　"Oh, if you only knew what a terrible person the American is today! These people are not only not ashamed of their ignorance, but they are proud of it." — This is a sentence from a letter Gorky wrote to the Soviet writer Sergeyev-Tsensky in 1927.

　　Now, the American imperialist aggressors have become even more terrible people, and their "ignorance" has reached an even more "terrible" degree. The war instigators actually believe that only they have mastered atomic energy, only they can build hydrogen bombs, superbombs, ... but they do not know that "the secret of atomic energy has long ceased to be a secret" (several Soviet statements), nor do they know "let alone hydrogen bombs, superbombs, it is fundamentally impossible to make them, even if you can make them, others will definitely be able to make them" (the gist of Joliot-Curie's speech).

　　The ignorance of the American aggressive warmongers is manifested in their daring to continue their frantic arms race in defiance of world opinion. The forces of the world's people defending peace are growing stronger day by day. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress issued the declaration "Absolute prohibition of atomic weapons, the government that uses atomic weapons first is a war criminal." Millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people support this declaration and are signing it. This is a very stern warning to the war criminals. But they have become even more frantic and more actively preparing for war. Madness means being delirious, which means being ignorant. Imperialism itself means blind competition, meaning war. Without overthrowing imperialism, without taking the power held in their hands, it is impossible to completely eliminate the danger of war.

　　Therefore, when foreign reporters asked Gorky what could be done to avoid war, he frankly replied:

　　"Do as was done in the Soviet Union. In order to end the evil reality, one must start with something. The working class started perfectly right, establishing its own power domestically. The result of his actions... aroused the beastly hatred of the villains of the world, (while) awakening and will awaken the active sympathy of the working masses and all honest people on the entire planet."

　　Gorky was a passionate warrior against imperialism and fascism. In his extraordinarily rich artistic creation, from early years to old age, he realistically and fiercely criticized the capitalist world. (Some people believe that Gorky's early creative activities were inclined to romanticism, but now the Soviet criticism and publishing circles have proved that this statement is wrong.) In his later essays and miscellanies, Gorky angrily fought with international murderers and some degenerates in Europe and America.

　　"The proletariat of the whole world should have one language, and that is the language of irreconcilable hatred for parasites, beasts, oppressors, and traitors," Gorky said.

　　When the two camps of the world—the decaying capitalist camp and the flourishing socialist camp—were clearly divided, Gorky's "Masters of Culture, Who Are You With?" sent a righteous and strict call to the world. He helped the unity of outstanding progressive cultural figures around the world. This has profound significance for the current world democratic and progressive cultural circles' anti-imperialist new war of aggression and defense of the world peace movement. Those who are truly humanitarians and truly love mankind cannot but demand strict sanctions against the enemies of mankind.

　　"Man—that sounds proud."

　　"If the enemy does not surrender—annihilate him."

　　Both of these sentences were said by Gorky, and talking about them side by side can be said to show Gorky's action program.

　　Those who are truly humanitarians and truly love mankind cannot but hate capitalist imperialism and cannot but support socialism and communism.

　　"Communism, like a judge, sentenced the remnant world to death. As the leader of the working masses, it (note: communism) overthrows it (note: the remnant world) by their strength, and, as the organizer of working determination—it is going to create a new world on the ground."

　　What passionate and powerful words!

　　In Gorky's very famous novel "Mother," the Bolshevik protagonist Pavel Vlasov proudly calls himself a "Party member," and he shouts "Long live our Party, comrades, long live the spiritual motherland of us!".

　　"Russia will be the most glorious democracy on earth!"—One of the protagonists in the novel says.

　　These are what Gorky dedicated his life's life and creation to. He had this confidence early on. His love and hope for the Russian—Soviet people can also be seen from the letters he wrote back when he was still in the United States (1906). "I tell you... despite all our misfortunes, we are far more advanced than this free America! It is especially obvious when you compare the farmers and workers here with our peasants and workers." "If you come and live here... you will understand the goodness of the Russians... really, they are lovely people."

　　On the tenth anniversary of the Soviet regime, Gorky said: "My joy and pride—(is) the new Russians, the builders of the new country."

　　Gorky's creation helped the birth and formation of this new person. In the world literary scene, there is no other writer who sings the praises of labor and laborers as powerfully as Gorky.

　　"To do well—is to live well" — the words of a character in a play written by Gorky after the revolution, he put forward the principle of working people. Pogomolov's character said: "I love work, work can increase respect for oneself... I think those who say the pain of creation is wrong, should say the joy of creation."

　　Gorky often called on Soviet writers to make the working people who build a communist society the protagonists of their books. The entire Soviet literature has developed along this path.

　　Gorky is immortal, and progressive humanity all over the world feels that he is still fighting in our ranks, against all man-eating beasts, against all parasites who fatten themselves by exploiting the labor of others, against all war instigators who attempt to use humanity as cannon fodder and build gold mountains in the sea of blood. Gorky is fighting in the ranks of socialist and communist builders to fulfill the great ideals of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and to fight for the life, culture, and future of the world for all mankind. Gorky is not dead!

　　高尔基—保卫和平的战士
    ——高尔基逝世十四周年纪念
    萧三
    “高尔基和现在在列宁、斯大林党领导之下这样热情地建设社会主义新社会的人们同一个感情，同一个思想活到最后一口气。他的眼睛到生命的末日都闪烁着斗争的和对劳动者的敌人，对法西斯蒂，对一切其他压迫者，对文化窒息者和战争煽动者的愤恨的光。……高尔基的模范，教给我们很多的东西。”莫洛托夫曾这样说。
    在今天全世界成万万善良的和正直的人们坚决保卫世界和平，反对侵略战争的高潮中，不能不想起这位一生为自由民主与社会主义，为真理，为和平而奋斗的热情的战士——高尔基。
    高尔基“给文化大师们”的信到现在仍如当时之有力。在英美帝国主义集团疯狂地煽动新的人类大屠杀的今天，高尔基说过的“资本家们——是社会上的危险人物”这句说，更加显得尖锐，正确。
    高尔基曾不遗余力地揭露了帝国主义的罪恶，揭露了资产阶级西方腐朽的文化。他曾撕破战争煽动者和其走狗——社会民主党人的假面具。他指出好战分子要在人的血海里砌金山。伟大的作家反对“和平主义”（Pacifism）的虚伪，揭破第二国际领袖们对欧洲人民的欺骗。
    高尔基早就看出了美国帝国主义者的丑恶凶相。还在二十多年以前（一九二九年）他回答美国杂志关于美国文明的问题时，他说：
    “我想，你们的文明，这是——我们星球上最丑恶的文明，因为它可怕地扩大了欧洲文明之所有各种各样的和可耻的丑恶。”
    这句话在今天读起来更加觉得逼真。革命家和人道主义者高尔基是怎样正确地描写了今天美帝国主义的啊！
    高尔基在美国时写了许多报告文学。这些文章揭露了资本帝国主义的罪恶本质。《黄鬼城》，《道德的神官》，《寂寞的王国》等文，痛斥美国那些亿万富翁对“黄鬼”——金子的贪婪，资本主义的“道德”就是束缚劳动人民。保护资本家利润的“礼教”。
    “人们的面孔是冰冷的——好像谁也不觉得当奴隶的不幸……有许多精力旺盛的面孔，但在每张面孔上首先只看见牙齿。（至于）内心的自由，精神的自由，在人们的眼睛里是不闪烁的。而这个没有自由的精力，令人想起还没有发钝的刀的冷光。这就是在黄鬼——金子手中的盲目的工具的自由。”
    读了《黄鬼城》里这段话，我们也可见美国文明的丑恶之一斑了。
    高尔基把美国的“文化”翻过底来看。他写了美国黑人的悲惨命运，认为那种种族歧视的理论是二十世纪可耻的现象。他嘲笑在纽约港口那座“自由之神”像的面孔是冷的，眼睛是瞎的，它手里的火把发不出光来，因为在美国没有真的自由。
    “呵哈，若是你知道，今天的美国人是怎样一种可怕的人！这些人不仅不以自己的无知为耻，反以为荣。”——这是一九二七年高尔基写给苏联作家谢尔结也夫·岑斯基的信里面的话。
    现在美帝国主义侵略分子成为了更加可怕的人，他们的“无知”，也到了更加“可怕”的程度。战争煽动者们而竟认为，只有他们自己掌握了原子能，只有他们会造氢气弹，超级弹，……而殊不知“原子能的秘密早已不成其为秘密了”（苏联的几次声明），也不知“姑且不说什么氢气弹，超级弹，根本还没有可能造成，即使你能造得成，别人也一定能造得成”（若里约·居里演说的大意）。
    美国侵略的好战分子之无知，就表现在他们竟敢冒天下之大不韪而继续疯狂备战。全世界人民保卫和平的力量一天天壮大了，保卫和平大会常委会发出了“绝对禁止原子武器，那个首先使用原子武器的政府就是战犯”的宣言，成百万、千万、万万的人都拥护这个宣言并在它下面签名，这对战争犯子是非常严厉的警告。但他们更加疯狂起来，更加积极备战。疯狂就是神志不清，就是无知。帝国主义本身就意味着盲目竞争，意味着战争。不打倒帝国主义，不把抓在他们手中的权力夺过来，是无法彻底消灭战争危险的。
    因此当外国记者们问高尔基，怎样做才可以避免战争，他直率地答说：
    “照在苏联所做了的一样做。为着了结邪恶的现实，必须从什么开始才行。工人阶级开始得完全对，在国内建立自己的政权。他的行动的结果……激起全世界恶汉的野兽的仇恨，（同时）唤起和还会唤起全地球上工人群众和一切正直人们的积极的同情。”
    高尔基是反对帝国主义，反对法西斯主义的热情的战士。在他的异常丰富的艺术创作里，从早年到晚年都现实主义地剧烈地批判着资本主义世界。（某些人认为高尔基的早期创作活动是偏于浪漫主义的，现在苏联的批评界的出版界证明，这种说法是错误的。）在他后来的许多论文和杂文里，高尔基愤怒地和国际上的凶手们，欧洲美洲的一些退化和人们搏斗。
    “全世界无产阶级应该有一种语言，这就是——对寄生虫，恶兽，压迫者和叛徒的不共戴天之仇恨的语言”——高尔基说。
    当全世界两个阵营——腐朽的资本主义阵营和兴盛的社会主义阵营——分得很清楚的时候，高尔基写的《文化大师们，你们和谁一道？》向全世界发出了正义的和严格的呼声。他帮助了全世界优秀进步文化人士的团结。这对于现在世界民主进步文化界反帝国主义新的侵略战争，保卫世界和平的运动有深长的意义。是真正的人道主义者，是真正爱人类的人，就不能不要求对人类的敌人采取严厉的制裁。
    “人——这是响起来很可自豪的”。
    “假如敌人不投降——歼灭他”。
    这两句话都是高尔基说的，并列起来谈，可是说，能看出高尔基的行动的纲领。
    是真正的人道主义者和真正爱人类的人，就不能不痛恶资本主义帝国主义，就不能不拥护社会主义共产主义。
    “共产主义，如同裁判官，给残余世界判了死刑，作为劳动群众的领袖，凭他们的力量它（注：共产主义）推倒它（注：残余世界），而，作为劳动毅力的组织者——要在地面上创造一个新的世界。”
    这是何等热情的、有力的字句！
    非常著名的高尔基的小说《母亲》里，那个布尔什维克的主人翁巴维尔·伏拉索夫，自豪地称自己为“党人”，他喊出“我们的党，同志们，我们精神的祖国万岁！”。
    “俄罗斯将会是地面上最光辉的民主！”——小说中的一个主人翁这么说。
    这些都是高尔基一生的生活与创作所致力的。他早就有此信心。他对俄国——苏联人民的热爱与希望，从他还在美国时（一九○六年）写回的信上也看得出。“我告诉你……尽管我们有一切的不幸，我们比这个自由美国先进得远多了！当你把这里的农夫与工人和我们的庄稼汉和工人比较一下，就特别明显地看得出来”。“假如你到这里来住住……你就会懂得俄国人的好处……真的，那是可爱的人民”。
    在苏维埃政权十周年纪念时，高尔基便说：“我的喜悦和自豪——（就是）新的俄罗斯人，新国家的建设者。”
    高尔基的创作帮助了这种新人的产生和形成。在世界文坛上没有另一个作家，像高尔基这样有力地歌唱劳动与劳动者的。
    “好好地作——就是好好的活”——革命后高尔基写的剧本里一个人物的说话，他把劳动人的原则提出来了。波戈莫洛夫剧中人说：“我爱工作，工作能提高对于自己的尊敬……我想，那些说创作的苦闷的人，——不对，应该说创作的愉快。”
    高尔基经常号召苏联作家把建设共产主义社会的劳动人作为自己书中的主人翁。整个苏联的文学就是走这条道路发展的。
    高尔基是不朽的，全世界进步的人类都感觉得，他现在仍然在我们的队伍里战斗着，反对一切吃人的野兽，反对一切剥削别人劳动而自肥的寄生虫，反对一切企图把人类当作炮灰而自己在血海里砌金山的战争煽动者。高尔基在社会主义共产主义建设者的队伍里为完成列宁、斯大林党的伟大理想而战斗着，为全人类的生命，文化及世界的未来而战斗着。高尔基不死！
