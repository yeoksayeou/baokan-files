　　Baoding's Industry and Commerce Gradually Improve
    Work Stoppages and Closures Have Basically Ceased
    [Our Newspaper, Baoding News] The difficulties faced by private enterprises in Baoding City, such as product stagnation and capital turnover difficulties, are now gradually improving after the municipal government, state-owned specialized companies, and the People's Bank provided strong support through loans, commissioned processing, order placements, consignment sales, and price adjustments.

    From late May to June 7, the Baoding City People's Bank issued a total of 1.1 billion yuan in loans, supporting 18 private industries, totaling 111 households. The department store actively adjusted retail and wholesale prices to rationalize them, gradually increasing the difference between retail and wholesale prices to 17%. The cotton yarn and cloth branch actively signed processing contracts with the weaving industry; the Baoding branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company supplied seven tons of raw materials to seven private iron factories in Nanguan. Thanks to this series of active support measures and the arrival of the wheat harvest season, as well as the development of trade between urban and rural areas, the phenomenon of work stoppages and closures in the city's major industries has basically ceased. Many industrial and commercial enterprises have organized joint purchases and sales, pooled funds, and improved their operations. According to a survey by the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, the number of households applying for closure a month ago was greater than the number of households opening for business. After the adjustment of industrial and commercial work began, the number of closures gradually decreased, while the number of openings and re-openings increased daily. From May 26 to June 14, a total of 26 households formally applied for resumption of business, and many others were still preparing to resume business. Market transactions are also becoming increasingly active. For example, eight private soy sauce gardens, including Yongmao, Xinlonghe, and Yuqinglong, invested 12 million yuan in the purchase of salt for pickling vegetables alone, according to statistics. They purchased 11,000 jin of small radishes at a time for pickling. Yongmao Soy Sauce Garden alone bought 157 bags of flour (10.2 million yuan) and 11 shi of beans, making about 35 large vats of fermented bean sauce and soy sauce. They also sent dedicated personnel to contact and promote sales externally, supplying more than 30 government units in Baoding City alone. Their pickles have also begun to be sold to Shijiazhuang, Boye, Wanxian, Gaoyang, and other places. Manager Wu of the company said, "Business is much easier to do after prices stabilized." Other industries, such as weaving, paint, electrical, Luo Quan, bamboo ware, and rope, are also thriving. In January, 11 Luo Quan businesses sold a total of 520 Luo Quans, and in February, they sold 542. Now, Rongji alone sells 30 Luo Quans a day, 900 a month, exceeding the total number of Luo Quans sold by the entire industry in February. Because hemp ropes are essential for farmers, the rope industry has a wide sales market. Businesses are actively purchasing raw materials, some going to Wangdu and others to Yuxian in Chahar South to purchase them. The paint industry has also jointly purchased raw materials from Tianjin, Hankou, and other places.         (Gu Ying)

　　保定工商业渐趋好转
    停工歇业现象已基本停止
    【本报保定讯】保定市私营企业产品滞销、资金周转不灵的困难，经市人民政府、国营各专业公司和人民银行以放款、委托加工、定货、代销、调整价格等方式予以大力扶植后，现已逐步好转。
    保市人民银行从五月下旬至六月七日止，计放款十一亿元，扶植了十八个私营行业，共一百一十一户。百货公司积极调整零售和批发价格，使零售和批发价格趋于合理，由无差额逐渐提到有百分之一七的差额。花纱布分公司积极与织布业订立加工合同；中国煤业建筑器材公司保定支公司供给了南关七户私营铁工厂七吨原料。由于这一系列的积极扶助，及麦收季节的到来，城乡贸易的开展，该市主要行业的停工、歇业现象基本上已告停止。不少工商业纷纷组织联购联销，调集资金，改善经营。据市工商联合会调查，一个月前申请歇业户多于开张户。调整工商业工作开始后，歇业者逐渐减少，而开张复业户日渐增多。从五月二十六日到六月十四日止，正式申请复业者共二十六户，其他酝酿复业者尚不少。市场交易亦日显活跃。如私营酱园永茂、信隆合、裕庆隆等八户，据统计仅买盐腌菜一项即投入一千二百万元的资本。一次买小萝卜腌菜达一万一千斤。永茂酱园一户买了一百五十七口袋面（一千零二十万元）、十一石豆子共做面酱和豆酱三十五大缸左右。并派专人对外联络推销，仅保市即供给着三十多个机关单位。其酱菜并已开始销到石家庄、博野、完县、高阳等地。该号吴经理说：“物价稳定以后，买卖好做多了。”其他如织布、油漆、电业、罗圈、竹荆器、麻绳等行业均欣欣向荣。一月份罗圈业十一户共销罗五百二十个，二月份销五百四十二个，而现在仅荣吉号一户即日销三十个，月销九百个，超过二月份全行销罗总数。麻绳业因麻绳是农民所必需的，所以销路很广，该行各户正积极采购原料，有的到望都，有的到察南禹县去采购。油漆业亦已联合到天津、汉口等地买原料。         （顾英）
