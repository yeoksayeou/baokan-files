Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: According to a Reuter's Tokyo dispatch: The All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation (Zengakuren) posted leaflets throughout Tokyo on the 21st, making the following demands to Johnson, Bradley, and others who are currently "visiting" Japan: (1) Oppose the establishment of military bases in Japan. (2) Cancel MacArthur's education advisor Eells' statement dismissing communists from educational institutions. (3) Conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, and all occupation forces withdraw from Japan. Tokyo police actually confiscated these leaflets and arrested the responsible students. At the same time, the peace petition rally planned by Zengakuren for the 22nd was also subjected to the Yoshida government's tyrannical suppression. According to Reuters and Kyodo News: On the 17th, the Ministry of Education of the Yoshida government issued a notice to the governors of each prefecture, and the presidents of all universities across the country, prohibiting students from participating in the rally, and threatening students that if they ignored the ban, the government would take action according to the police authorities' ban on gatherings and demonstrations across the country.

According to Kyodo News Fukuoka: The Kyushu Student Self-Government Association Federation issued a declaration of struggle on the 21st, stating: Our struggle policy is: Oppose the suppression of the Communist Party, oppose the dissolution of Zengakuren, promptly conclude a fair and comprehensive peace treaty, and launch a joint struggle between workers and students!

　　反对在日本建立军事基地
    日学生举行和平请愿
    【新华社二十二日讯】据路透社东京讯：全日学生自治会联合会（全日学联）二十一日在东京各地张贴传单，向刻正“访问”日本的詹逊、布莱德雷等三人提出下列要求：（一）反对在日本建立军事基地。（二）取消麦克阿瑟教育顾问意尔斯将共产党员从教育机关中开除出去的声明。（三）早日签订全面对日和约，一切占领军撤出日本。东京警察竟将这些传单加以没收，并逮捕负责的学生。同时，全日学联拟于二十二日举行的和平请愿大会，也遭到吉田政府的横暴镇压。据路透社与共同社消息：吉田政府文部省于十七日通令各都、道、府、县及全国各大学校长，禁止学生参加该项大会，并恫吓学生如忽视禁令，政府将根据警察当局的在全国范围内不许集会与示威游行的禁令，加以处置。
    另据共同社福冈讯：九州学生自治会联合会于二十一日发表斗争声明称：我们的斗争方针是：反对镇压共产党，反对解散全日学联，迅速缔结公正的全面和约，展开工人与学生的联合斗争！
