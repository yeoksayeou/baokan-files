　　Preliminary Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce in Wuhan and Existing Problems
　　By our Special Correspondent Xiao Hang
　　I. Where is the progress in industry and commerce?
　　Since price stabilization, private industry and commerce in Wuhan are undergoing changes and have made some progress. This is that some industrialists and businessmen have abandoned the idea of ​​profiteering and have begun to focus their minds on improving business operations.
　　There are two situations in the transformation of industry and commerce in Wuhan. One is that industrial and commercial households that cannot be maintained and have no prospects have to transform. Moreover, the transformation is faster and more thorough. For example, cotton yarn trading has shifted from speculation to connecting urban and rural materials. Before liberation, they specialized in buying and selling short, selling "yarn orders" as finished products, and using "yarn orders" as trading chips, kicking them around, which was actually gambling. After liberation, the situation has not changed much. Since the establishment of the Cotton Yarn Exchange, especially after price stabilization, the business of "kicking the ball" has lost its possibility of existence. Now they have all stopped this kind of trading. In addition to four companies that have switched to towel and other industries, another thirty-eight companies, with the guidance of the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau, jointly formed "Hezhong Supply and Marketing Co., Ltd.", determined the business policy of focusing on the transportation and sales of local products, supplemented by retail sales of yarn and cloth and trust business. They have opened four stores, and preparations for going to the countryside are underway. At the same time, they signed a consignment contract with the Huasha Cloth Company. Originally, a store could maintain business by selling three or four pieces of yarn a day, and make a profit by selling five pieces. Now, with their old sales relationships and sales skills, each store can sell nine pieces of yarn a day. As a result, their business interest has greatly increased, and they have asked the Huasha Cloth Company to allocate more cotton yarn. The original contract stipulated that the company's maximum inventory was 30 pieces of yarn, and the Huasha Cloth Company would replenish the yarn as it sold. Now, they are asking to increase the inventory to 50 pieces. At the same time, the changes in the high-end consumer goods industry are also obvious. These industries operate businesses including seafood, silk, Shaoxing wine, Hunan embroidery, wedding sedan chairs, and Zha Cai (festive decorations). Now they are either switching industries or changing their business focus. Western chefs are cooking ordinary meals; the price list of high-end hairdressers has changed 30,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan; and pottery is placed on the shelves of fine porcelain shops.
　　The other situation is to strive to adapt to the needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood and improve business methods. Although there are difficulties, the future is bright. Especially for private industries, there are many drawbacks in operation, so we must work hard to transform them to completely change. Although it is slow, there is still progress. For example, the First Yarn Factory originally burned two boilers for each turbine. After the workers' research, it was changed to burning one, which can save 4.2 tons of coal per day, greatly reducing production costs.
　　Wuhan was originally an inland commercial city and had certain connections with rural areas. The so-called "thoroughfare of nine provinces" shows that Wuhan is a large distribution center for goods. Therefore, the always active local product market has aroused great interest among many industrialists and businessmen. The supply and marketing company formed by 38 cotton yarn companies has written letters to various towns to establish trading relationships, preparing to transport yarn to the countryside for sale and exchange for local products. The bristles industry has increased by two times; the export industry has increased from four to ten. Some cloth merchants believe that "kicking the ball" only in Wuhan will not yield good results, and they plan to go to the countryside to do business. In the past, prices fell and merchants had no profits, and business was at a standstill. Recently, prices have stabilized and the market has gradually become active, and more and more merchants are applying to go abroad. They are going to rural areas in Henan, western Hubei, and northern Hubei to buy eggs, sesame seeds, straw hats, cotton, and other local products and transport them to Wuhan for sale. In the past, they were afraid of being controlled and had some concerns. After the interpretation of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, their thinking has also become clear. Everyone's eyes are also facing the countryside, and they are willing to do their best to connect urban and rural relations. This is a progress.
　　Another progressive phenomenon is that some commercial capital is transferring to industry; some industrialists and businessmen are willing to invest their gold and silver in production. In May, the biggest changes in Wuhan's commerce were in cotton, cloth, department stores, porcelain, and sacks, mostly capital appreciation, mergers, and reorganizations. According to statistics from the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau, most of the conversions are to industry. In May, a total of 680 households applied to open businesses, of which 349 were in the industrial sector. In order to reduce the difficulty of capital turnover, some industrialists and businessmen holding gold and silver requested state banks to deposit and exchange gold and silver. In order to help them overcome difficulties, state banks also allowed them to deposit and exchange a portion at appropriate prices. One industrialist and businessman exchanged 19 taels, 1 mace, 1 fen, and 6.6 li of gold and 1,200 silver dollars at one time, which was equivalent to more than 34.8 million yuan in RMB at the current price. In addition, some people are preparing to take out funds to open new stores to operate cotton transportation and sales business.
　　These changes in Wuhan's industry and commerce have laid a cornerstone for further transformation; however, there are still many shortcomings that must be seriously overcome.
　　II. What are some of the problems?
　　What is mentioned here is only part of the problem. These problems reflect that the business attitude of some industrialists and businessmen is still not honest enough.
　　At present, the government's processing entrusted to private yarn factories is obviously a losing business. Even so, in order to help the factories maintain production, the Central South China Textile Company still signed processing contracts with the factories. However, in the individual yarn factories in Wuhan, some twists and turns have occurred. Originally, the principle of the government's commissioned processing labor standard was calculated according to the average standard of general factories in the same region under reasonable operating conditions. Moreover, if the commissioned processing is to maintain the production of private factories and prevent them from stopping, then it is necessary to take into account the reduction of the burden on the government and state-owned enterprises, and the calculation of the processing fees and prices of private factories should be lower than the general normal processing fees and prices. Therefore, when state-owned enterprises in Wuhan conduct commissioned processing agreements with private factories, they hope to be able to follow reasonable standards in order to lose less money, and suggest long-term processing, so that the losses in the off-season can be partially compensated for in the peak season. However, after several changes in methods and consultations, the private factory owners are only relying on the government, and hoping to earn more money from the government, so that the consultation is difficult to proceed. However, if private factories do not accept processing, it is not easy to maintain at present. So the private factory owners came up with a way, that is, let the government first lend a part of the cotton to maintain production, and then negotiate. The government took a sincere attitude and agreed to this method. However, after the private factory owners borrowed the cotton, they dragged on for 20 days and stopped negotiating. This is a dishonest performance of individual private yarn factory owners. There are also individual coal mine managers who, under the pretext of production difficulties, requested government loans for assistance. The state bank also lent him the money. However, after investigation, the sales of this coal mine's products were not bad, and it was not difficult. This is another kind of dishonest performance. If these dishonest business attitudes are not transformed, it will not be beneficial to the production cause.
　　In addition, some industrialists and businessmen have also put forward many unreasonable demands to the government. For example, there are 107 seafood businesses in Hankou, and 20 have reported closure. The entire industry owes 640 million yuan in taxes. The tax bureau considered that some stores did have difficulties and prepared to reduce some of the taxes as appropriate. However, some people in the industry demanded that all taxes be reduced or exempted, otherwise they would all close down. However, when the Industry and Commerce Bureau considered allowing them to close down, they no longer mentioned the application for closure. Originally, they wanted to threaten the government with "closure". For example, there were originally 21 cigarette raw material businesses, and 16 have reported closure. Now they require: 1. Give department stores agency sales of paper; 2. Let private merchants retail all of it; 3. Prohibit merchants from buying and selling paper; 4. Reduce or exempt taxes for April and May. They also use "total closure" to coerce the government to accept these demands. Now, the Industry and Commerce Bureau is dealing with them separately. For example, some tea merchants are asking the tea company to cancel the consignment business and sell the tea to them at cost or below cost. However, consignment sales of tea is exactly what some stores are asking for, and they are very grateful to the government for taking care of them. At the same time, according to government regulations, the number of tea consignment stores should not exceed 10% of all stores in the industry, while Wuhan's consignment stores are currently only 5% of the entire industry. Therefore, the problem is not to cancel the consignment, but that some tea merchants are trying to monopolize the tea market and seek high profits. This is exactly what the broad masses of citizens oppose. In addition, a group of cloth wholesalers who specialize in "kicking the ball" are also asking the government to cancel consignment stores, which is consistent with the intentions of some tea merchants.
　　III. Beware of speculation!
　　Now, the transaction volume in the Wuhan market has increased significantly. Compared with early June and late May, the increases are: cotton increased by 59%, cotton yarn increased by 104%, cloth increased by 48%, grain increased by 201%, salt increased by 19%, sesame oil increased by 21%, and tung oil increased by 8%. However, under the gratifying phenomenon of increased transaction volume, there are hidden attempts by some merchants to revive speculation and profiteering, which must be guarded against. At present, the textile industry in Wuhan has improved somewhat, but cotton is still in short supply. If the market is not well managed, it may cause fluctuations in cotton prices, which will drive other prices. For example, after the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau was ordered to cancel cotton price negotiations on May 29, some cotton merchants took the opportunity to raise cotton prices and speculate. In just a few days, cotton rose from 770,000 yuan per dan to 900,000 yuan. After the Central South China Textile Company sold off its inventory, after the education of the Central South China Trade Department, and after the review of the cotton merchants' general meeting, cotton prices stabilized again. Another phenomenon is that after the Coal Company stopped the retail business of coal balls, private merchants actually raised the price of coal balls, increasing the profit from 15% to 20% to 50%. Some merchants are also trying to divide sales areas as a protective charm to facilitate the "comeback" of speculation and profiteering. A group of salt merchants are making such demands: within the nine counties around Wuhan, the salt company should not do business, so as not to affect the sales of salt merchants. In fact, even in Hankou, the salt company has not affected the sales of salt merchants. In April, private sales reached 3.78 million catties, while public sales were only 190,000 catties. In May, the salt company reviewed the style of "official salt stores" and its business developed, but sales only accounted for a little over 40% of the total sales. In addition, it was discovered that some private merchants are hoarding tobacco leaves. Therefore, recently, the main sellers of tobacco leaves are state-owned companies, while private merchants rarely sell, resulting in a sharp decline in the transaction volume of tobacco leaves. According to statistics from the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau, the transaction volume of tobacco leaves in late May was 2,580 dan, with the highest price of 300,000 yuan per dan; in early June, the transaction volume was only 1,595 dan, with the highest price of 430,000 yuan.
　　The above-mentioned phenomena of speculation and hoarding prove that we must be vigilant, and also prove that state-owned trade organs must be responsible for regulating supply and demand and stabilizing prices, and must have retail stores that can stabilize the retail market prices of grain, coal, yarn, cloth, edible oil, edible salt, petroleum, and other daily necessities of the people, so as to stop the disruption of the market by speculators, which is conducive to the lives of the broad masses of the people and the legitimate operation of industry and commerce.

　　武汉私营工商业的初步改造和现存的若干问题
    本报特派记者  萧航
    一、工商业的进步在那里？
    物价稳定以来的武汉私营工商业，正在发生变化，也有了一定程度的进步。这就是一部分工商业者已打消了谋取暴利的念头，开始把脑筋用在改善经营上。
    武汉市工商业的改造，有两种情况。一种是没法维持而又没有前途的工商户，就不得不进行转变。而且转变得较快，也比较彻底。例如棉纱的交易，是从投机转向沟通城乡物资的。他们在解放以前，专事买空卖空，以“纱单”当作成品出售，又以“纱单”作为交易筹码，踢过来踢过去，实际就是赌博。解放以后，情形还没有什么改变。自从棉纱交易所成立，特别是物价稳定以后，“踢皮球”的生意丧失了存在的可能，现在他们均已停止了这种交易。除了四家转入毛巾等业以外，另有三十八家，得助于市工商局的指导，联合组成“合众供销股份有限公司”，确定经营方针，以运销土产为主，以零销纱布及办理信托业务为辅。他们已经开设了四个门市部，下乡的准备工作正着手进行。同时，他们和花纱布公司订立了代销合同。本来，一个门市部一天卖三、四件纱，即可维持营业，卖五件就有利润可得。现在，凭着他们的旧有推销关系和推销技术，每个门市部每天能卖九件纱。于是，他们的经营兴趣大增，要求花纱布公司增拨棉纱。原来合同规定该公司最高存货三十件纱，卖几件由花纱布公司补充几件。现在，他们要求存货增至五十件。同时，高级消费品业的变化也很明显。这些行业经营的业务，包括海味、绸缎、绍酒、湘绣、喜轿、扎彩等九种。现在它们或则转业，或则改变了经营重点。西餐厨师做起了普通饭菜；高级理发业的价目表，把三万元改为四千元；而细瓷店的货架上，则摆起了陶器。
    另一种情况是努力适应国计民生的需要，改善经营方法，虽有困难而前途是光明的。特别是私营工业，经营上的积弊甚多，就须努力改造才能彻底转变。虽然慢，但进步还是有的。例如第一纱厂，原来每部透平机烧两个锅炉，经过工人的研究，改烧一个，每天能节煤四·二吨，使生产成本大大降低。
    武汉原是一个内地商业城市，和农村有一定的联系，所谓“九省通衢”，正说明着武汉是一个很大的货物集散地。因而始终活跃着的土产市场，引起了不少工商业者的极大兴趣。三十八家棉纱业合组的供销公司，已经写信到各城镇去，建立交易关系，准备运纱到乡间去销售，换购土产。猪鬃业已增加两倍；出口业原有四家，现已增至十家。一部分布商相信尽在武汉市内“踢皮球”，没有好结果，已打算下乡去做买卖了。过去物价下落，行商无利可图，营业陷于停顿状态。近来物价平稳，市场渐趋活跃，申请出境的行商就越来越多。他们要去河南、鄂西、鄂北等地农村，收买鸡蛋、芝麻、草帽、棉花等土产，运汉销售。过去他们怕受管制，有些顾虑，经过工商局的解释，思想上也清楚了。大家的眼睛也就朝向农村，愿意在沟通城乡关系上尽一把力，这是一个进步。
    再一个进步的现象是，一部分商业资本正向工业转移；有些工商业家则愿意把持有的金银投入生产。五月份的武汉商业，以棉花、布、百货、瓷器、麻袋等业变化最大，多为资本升值合并改组。据市工商局统计，转业以转入工业者为多。在五月份内，申请开业的共六百八十户，其中工业方面的占了三百四十九户。为了减少资金周转的困难，有些持有金银的工商业者，要求国家银行存兑金银。国家银行为了帮助他们克服困难，也允许以适当价格存兑一部分。有一个工商业家一次就兑换了黄金十九两一钱六分六厘，银元一千二百元，按当日牌价，合人民币三千四百八十多万元。另外，还有人准备拿出资金，开设新的商店，经营棉花运销业务。
    武汉工商业的这些转变，已给进一步的改造放下了一块基石；但是还有不少缺点须认真克服。
    二、还有些什么问题？
    这里提到的，只是问题的一部分。这些问题，反映着某些工商业者的经营态度还欠老实。
    目前，政府对私营纱厂的委托加工，是明摆着的赔本生意。即使如此，为了扶助各厂维持生产，中南区花纱布公司依然与各厂签订了加工合同。然而在武汉个别的纱厂方面却发生了某些曲折。原来政府委托加工的工缴标准的原则，是依照同一地区一般工厂在合理经营条件之下的中等标准来计算。而且委托加工的情况如果是为了维持私营工厂的生产不使停顿，那么就须兼顾到减轻政府和国营企业的负担，私营工厂的加工费和货价的计算，应该低于一般正常的加工费和货价。所以武汉市国营企业在与私营工厂进行委托加工的协议时，希望能够按照合理标准，以便少赔一点钱，并建议长期加工，以便在旺月时可以部分地弥补淡月中的亏损。但是几经变更办法和磋商，均因私营厂主只是一味依赖政府，而且希望能多赚一些政府的钱，以致协商难以进行。可是，私营工厂如不接受加工，目前又不容易维持。于是私营厂主想出了一个办法，那就是让政府先借给一部分棉花，把生产维持下来，然后再行协商。政府一本以诚待人的态度，同意了这个办法。但是，私营厂主借去棉花之后，就一拖二十天，不再进行协商了。这是个别私营纱厂厂主不老实的表现。还有个别煤矿经理，借口生产困难，要求政府贷款帮助。国家银行也就贷给了他。可是一调查，这个煤矿的产品销路不坏，并不困难。这又是一种不老实的表现。这些不老实的经营态度，如果不好好转变，对生产事业是没有什么好处的。
    此外，有些工商业者，还向政府提出了许多不合理的要求。例如：汉口有一百零七家海味业，已有二十家报停。整个行业欠税款六亿四千万元。税局考虑到某些商店确有困难，准备酌量减轻一些。而该业的某些人却要求全部减免，否则，要全部停业。但在工商局考虑允许他们停业时，他们却又不再提申请停业的事了。原来他们是想以“停业”威胁政府。又如：香烟原料业原有二十一家，有十六家已报停，现在要求：一、给百货公司代销盘纸；二、零售全让给私商；三、禁止行商买卖盘纸；四、减免四、五月份税款。他们也是以“全部停业”来要挟政府接受这些要求。现在，工商局正在分别处理。再如：有些茶叶商要求茶叶公司取消代销业务，把茶叶按成本或低于成本卖给他们。但是，代销茶叶正是某些商店的要求，他们正在十分感激政府对他们的照顾。同时，按照政府规定，茶叶代销店的数目不超过该业全部商店的百分之十，而武汉的代销店现仅及全业的百分之五。所以问题不在于取消代销，而在于某些茶商企图垄断茶叶市场，谋取高额利润。这，正是广大市民所反对的。另外，有一批专干“踢皮球”活动的布业批发商，也在要求政府取消代销店，这是和某些茶商的企图是一致的。
    三、警惕投机活动！
    现在，武汉市场的成交量已有着显著的增加，如以六月上旬与五月下旬相比，则是：棉花增加百分之五十九，棉纱增加百分之一百零四，布增加百分之四十八，粮食增加百分之二百零一，盐增加百分之十九，麻油增加百分之二十一，桐油增加百分之八。但是在成交量增大的可喜现象下，却隐伏着某些商人投机取巧的复活企图，不能不加以警惕。目前，武汉市纺织业已有部分好转，而棉花还处于供不应求的状态，如果市场管理不好，就有可能引起棉价波动，而带动其他物价。例如：五月二十九日，市工商局奉令取消棉花议价之后，有些棉商就乘隙而入，哄抬棉价，投机取巧。没过几天，棉花就从每担七十七万元涨到了九十万元。经过中南区花纱布公司的抛售，经过中南区贸易部的教育，经过棉商全体会议的检讨，棉价才又平稳下来。另一种现象是，煤业公司停止煤球零售业务以后，私商竟把煤球的价格提高，利润从百分之十五到二十提高到百分之五十。有些商人还企图以划分销售地区，作为护身符，以便于投机倒把的“东山再起”。一部分盐商就是这样的要求：在武汉周围的九个县之内，盐业公司不要作生意，免得影响了盐商的销路。其实，即使在汉口市内，盐业公司也没有影响了盐商的销路。四月份，私销达三百七十八万斤，公销仅十九万斤。五月份，盐业公司检讨了“官盐店”的作风，业务有了发展，但销售量也仅占总销额的百分之四十强。此外，还发现了有些私商正在囤积烟叶。因而最近出售烟叶的主要是国家公司，而私商却极少出售，形成了烟叶成交量大减。据市工商局统计，五月下旬烟叶成交量为二、五八○担，最高每担价格三十万元；六月上旬成交仅一、五九五担，最高价格为四十三万元。
    上述这些投机囤积的现象，证明了必须提高警惕，也证明了国营贸易机关必须负责调剂供求、稳定物价，而又必须有能够稳定零售市场价格的粮食、煤炭、纱布、食油、食盐、石油等人民日用必需品的零售店，以制止投机商人的扰乱市场，有利于广大人民的生活和正当工商业的经营。
