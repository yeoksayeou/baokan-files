Henan Grain Company Provides Trade Grain Loans

[This Dispatch from Zhengzhou] The Henan Provincial Company of the China Grain Company has decided to provide loans of stored grain to help farmers in various regions with production and to get through the lean season. The company recently received 50 million jin of coarse grains from the Northeast, allocated by the Ministry of Trade. Before the coarse grains arrive, the company will promptly address the problem of food for the masses. It has decided to use the coarse grains stored by its subordinate branches in Xuchang, Luohe, Zhumadian, Zhoukou, Luoyang, Shangqiu, and the Kaifeng City Company to provide loans to the masses in advance. At the same time, it has decided to provide 2 million jin of coarse grains, such as corn, millet, and sorghum, in the suburban areas of Zhengzhou, to be repaid with wheat after the wheat harvest. The method of lending will be that the grain company is responsible for the grain supply, and the cooperative headquarters is responsible for organizing the lending. The target beneficiaries are truly poor working people. At the same time, to ensure that the grain loans are repaid, a system of agricultural associations responsible and joint guarantees will be adopted at the township level. (Sai)
