　　The Situation of Undifferentiated Party and Government is Beginning to Change
    A Record of the CCP Tangshan Prefectural Committee Improving Leadership Methods in Districts and Villages
    By our reporter Shang Kai
    The Machine Isn't Running Smoothly
    The Tangshan Prefectural Committee of Hebei Province administers thirteen counties, one hundred and thirty-two districts, and six thousand one hundred and seventy-eight administrative villages. This organizational leadership system is like a complex machine. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year People's Liberation War, as well as the land reform, it operated non-stop, completing certain historical tasks. But since the entire area was liberated in the winter of 1948 and peaceful construction began, the operational efficiency of this machine has become increasingly low. A serious problem has arisen here—the undifferentiated Party and government, undifferentiated Party and people, and all-encompassing leadership methods are no longer suitable for the new situation and have become a major obstacle in the work.
    For the past twelve years, the area has been in an environment of urgent guerrilla warfare. For a long time, they have been accustomed to the all-encompassing leadership methods of undifferentiated Party and government. The leadership of the district over the villages is generally to establish central villages or divide them into regions and townships, with the district committee appointing team leaders. When the higher authorities issue instructions for work tasks, the team leader immediately convenes the district and village cadres in this area to transmit and deploy them, and everyone goes to work together. Party affairs cadres handle civil administration cases, substituting the Party for the government, falling into serious bureaucratism. Political and civil affairs cadres also participate in leading branch work, and even non-Party cadres lead branches. On the village organization level, there has been a long-term lack of consolidation. Some organizations from the War of Resistance period still exist. In most villages, mass organizations such as farmers' associations and women's federations only have cadres and no members. In addition to the undifferentiated Party and government, the situation of undifferentiated Party and people is more widespread and serious. After receiving instructions from higher authorities, the branch would routinely convene a branch members' meeting, a village cadres' meeting, and a mass meeting to transmit and deploy them. Then, the Party members would go to promote, play an exemplary role, and influence and drive the masses. This has become a formula.
    Such a leadership method has led to confusion and malfunction in the district and village organizational system and leadership relations, generally manifesting the contradiction and opposition between central work and departmental work. County committee secretaries and district committee secretaries are busy all day long, but the problems existing and occurring in the branches cannot be studied and resolved in a timely manner. Propaganda cadres of the county and district committees feel that branch education cannot be carried out, while the organization departments have many cadre problems that no one handles. According to the statistics of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee, in the past year alone, five county committees out of thirteen, namely Funing, Fengnan, Lulong, Luanxian, and Changli, have not studied branch work.
    Finding a New Path
    The Tangshan Prefectural Committee discovered this complex and chaotic situation as early as last autumn, and the Provincial Committee also proposed suggestions for improvement. However, at that time, there was a lack of experience and methods for improvement. Later, it was decided that the first step was to change the thinking of the vast number of county and district cadres, so that they would recognize that the old leadership methods were no longer suitable for the current situation and had become an obstacle to the work. Then, everyone was mobilized to come up with solutions. In this way, an atmosphere of "changing leadership methods" began to rise in the Tangshan Prefectural Committee area. During this period, many cadres had experienced the difficulties that the old leadership methods had given to the work from their practical work. Therefore, except for a few cadres in some counties who had ideological concerns about "changing leadership methods" (such as fearing that no one would do the central work), the thinking of the general cadres began to change. During the process of deliberation, many county and district committees, after clarifying their thinking, first came up with many specific methods and began to change leadership methods in their own counties and districts. For example, the secretary and district head of the Sixth District of Zunhua first demarcated their responsibilities and strictly stipulated the system, and no one was allowed to overstep their authority. During this period, the prefectural and county committees went deep into the districts and villages to help create experiences, solve difficulties in the work, and ideological obstacles, and worked with everyone to find new paths.
    After a period of deliberation, the prefectural committee has explored a relatively clear direction. Therefore, at the joint meeting of organization ministers in February, it was officially announced that the all-encompassing leadership methods of undifferentiated Party and government and undifferentiated Party and people must be resolutely changed. The Party committee should learn to grasp policies and guidelines, implement collective leadership, scientific division of labor, and clarify the scope of responsibilities. The Party's leadership over non-Party departments should be through the Party group, and the phenomenon of substituting the Party for the government should be strictly corrected. Each department of the Party, government, and mass organizations should establish its own departmental work and ensure the completion of central tasks through the organizational system. It was also emphasized that Party affairs cadres should do Party affairs work, go deep into the branches to arrange and inspect central work, consolidate organizations, educate Party members, and solve existing problems in the branches. In order to strictly and effectively correct the chaos in village organizations and the phenomenon of substituting the Party for the government, it was announced that the organization of the central village would be abolished, and the branch was strictly prohibited from taking care of everything.
    New Situations Appear
    After three months of efforts, at present, judging from the overall situation and trends, the leadership methods of counties, districts, and villages in the Tangshan Prefectural Committee area have gradually changed. This is first manifested in the fact that most of the county and district-level Party committees have clarified the method of implementing departmental division of labor and responsibility with the Party committee as the core of leadership, and Party groups have generally been established in non-Party departments. The district committee began to get rid of cumbersome affairs and go deep into the branches, using the Party's organizational system and ideological leadership to ensure the completion of central tasks. Chengnan District, Luannan, has made better changes. For example, problems such as spring loans, spring plowing, and representative meetings are directly arranged by the district government to the village government. Party affairs cadres help the branch hold branch members' meetings to discuss how to ensure the completion of tasks. After the village head transmits and deploys the work to the whole village, the Party members go to promote and mobilize, playing a leading and guaranteeing role. Some district committees have begun to learn to convene Party groups or Party member cadres in charge of departments through certain meetings to supervise and inspect, instead of taking care of everything and interfering in everything. Secondly, some areas have transformed the grassroots organizations, and Party affairs cadres have begun to go deep into the branches. After changing the leadership in the Fourteenth District of Fengrun, several district committee members participated in five or six branch meetings each within twenty days and focused on solving some problems in the work style of Party member cadres. After the district committees of the Second and Third Districts of Leting detached themselves from affairs and went deep into the branches, they discovered many problems. For example, the Six Villages Model Branch of the Third District, which has a historical significance, actually discovered the corrupt behavior of cadres violating policies and selling trees. Zhao Xisheng, the propaganda committee member of the Daheikeng Branch of the Second District, privately suspended the organizational relations of seven Party members without discussion by the branch and approval by the district committee. At the same time, many villages have established a departmental division of labor system, overcoming the phenomenon of district cadres randomly grabbing cadres after entering the village, and also solving the contradiction between the work of some village cadres and individual production.
    Greater Efforts Must Continue to be Made
    Changing the long-standing leadership methods is an arduous process of ideological education and struggle. The current transformation is only a beginning, and there are still many problems in the work that urgently need to be solved. Some county and district committee leaders still yearn for the all-encompassing leadership methods in their thinking, do not believe in the strength of other organizations, and fear that Party affairs cadres will not be able to complete the central work after going deep into the branches. Therefore, they still do not pay attention to branch work. Some district-level cadres believe that not managing administrative issues means they have no power and are not used to going deep into the branches. These erroneous ideas are major obstacles to changing leadership methods. Therefore, in many counties, the phenomena of undifferentiated Party and government and Party committee taking care of everything in district-level leadership are still very serious.
    On the other hand, after the separation of Party and government in some areas, the phenomenon of decoupling between government cadres and Party committees has formed, and even independence is occurring. Some district committees are restrained in their leadership, forming tailism. Regarding the above problems, the prefectural and county committees should further supervise and inspect, go deep into the lower levels, provide frequent and specific assistance to district and village cadres, and solve problems in a timely manner, so as to strive for a complete transformation of leadership methods in the entire region.

　　党政不分的情况开始转变
    记中共唐山地委改进区村领导方法
    本报记者  商恺
    机器运转不灵了
    河北省唐山地委区共辖十三个县，一百三十二个区，六千一百七十八个行政村。这一套组织领导系统，像是一部复杂的机器。在八年抗日战争和三年人民解放战争、以及土地改革中，它不停地运转，完成了一定的历史任务。但自一九四八年冬该区全部解放，开始和平建设以来，这部机器的运转效率愈来愈低了，这里发生了一个严重的问题——党政不分、党民不分、一揽子的领导方法，已不能适应新的形势，而成为工作中的重大障碍了。
    该区十二年来，一直处在情况紧迫的游击战争环境中。长时期习惯于党政不分的一揽子领导方法。区对村的领导，一般的都是建立中心村，或分片分乡，由区委任组长。上级有什么工作任务指示下来，组长即将这一片的区、村干部召集一起，进行传达布置，大家一齐去搞。党务干部处理民政案件，以党代政，陷入严重的事务主义。政民干部也参加领导支部工作，甚至非党干部也去领导支部。在村组织上，长期缺乏整理，有的抗日时期的各种组织都还存在，大多村子的农会、妇会等群众团体，只有干部没有会员。党政不分以外，党民不分的情况更为普遍和严重。支部每次接到上级指示后，就回村照例召开支部党员大会、村干会、群众会，传达布置。然后党员分头宣传，起模范带头作用，影响与带动群众，就这样成了一套公式。
    这样的领导方法，使区、村组织系统和领导关系，陷于混乱不灵，普遍表现了中心工作与部门工作的矛盾对立。县委书记、区委书记整天忙碌，但支部中存在和发生的问题，却不能及时研究解决。而县、区委宣传干部感到支部教育无法进行，组织部门则存有许多干部问题无人处理。根据唐山地委统计，去年一年来；十三个县委会，就有抚宁、丰南、卢龙、滦县、昌黎五个县委会没有研究过支部工作。
    找出新的道路
    唐山地委远在去年秋天就发现了这种复杂混乱的情况，省委也曾提出过改进的意见。但是当时却缺少改进的经验和办法。后来决定首先要转变广大县区干部的思想，使他们认识到旧的领导方法，已不适应目前的形势，而且已成为工作中的障碍。然后发动大家想办法。这样，“改变领导方法”的空气在唐山地委区开始高涨起来。在这个时期，有不少干部已从实际工作中体验到旧的领导方法所给予工作的困难。因此，对“转变领导方法”除少数县部分干部思想上有所顾虑（如怕中心工作没人做了）外，一般干部思想都开始转变。在酝酿过程中，有不少县、区委因搞通了思想，首先想出许多具体办法，从本县本区开始转变领导方法。如遵化六区区委书记和区长便首先划清了自己的职责范围，严格规定制度，谁也不许越权乱管。地委县委在这个期间，则深入区、村，帮助创造经验，解决工作中的困难及思想上的障碍，和大家一齐动手寻觅新的道路。
    经过一个时期的酝酿，地委已摸索到比较明确的方向。遂于二月间的组织部长联席会上正式宣布，坚决改变党政不分、党民不分的一揽子领导方法。党委要学习掌握政策方针，集体领导，科学分工，明确职责范围。党对非党部门领导，要通过党组，严格纠正以党代政现象。党、政权和群众团体的各部门，要建立自己的部门工作，通过组织系统，保证完成中心任务。并强调党务干部要做党务工作，深入支部布置检查中心工作，整理组织，教育党员，解决支部中存在的问题。为了严格有效的纠正村组织混乱及以党代政现象，宣布取消中心村的组织，并严格禁止支部包办一切。
    新的情况出现了
    经过三个月的努力，目前从总的情况和趋势看，唐山地委区的县、区、村领导方法，已逐渐转变。这首先表现在，县、区两级党委大部明确了以党委为领导核心实行部门分工负责的方法，党在非党部门一般都建立了党组。区委开始摆脱繁琐事务，深入支部，以党的组织系统和思想领导来保证中心任务的完成。滦南城厢区转变的较好，如春贷、春耕、代表会等问题，完全由区政权直接布置到村政权。党务干部则帮助支部召开支部党员会，讨论如何保证任务完成。等村长传达布置到全村后，党员即分头深入宣传鼓动，起带动和保证作用。区委对其他部门的领导，有的已开始学会召集党组或部门负责的党员干部，通过一定会议进行督促检查，而不是包办代替事事干涉了。其次，有些地区已改造了基层组织，党务干部开始深入支部。丰润十四区改变领导后，几个区委在二十天内每人都参加了五、六个支部会，并着重解决了一些党员干部的作风问题。乐亭二、三区区委脱开事务，深入支部后发现很多问题，如三区具有历史性的六庄模范支部，竟发现了干部违犯政策伐卖树木的贪污行为。二区大黑坑支部宣委赵希圣，未经支部讨论和区委批准即私行停止了七个党员的组织关系。同时，不少村子建立了部门分工的制度，克服了区干部进村后乱抓干部的现象，也解决了一部分村干部工作和个人生产的矛盾。
    还须继续作更大的努力
    转变长期习惯了的领导方法，是一个艰巨的思想教育和斗争过程。目前的转变仅仅是一个开始，工作中还存在不少问题急需解决。有的县、区委领导思想上，仍留恋着一揽子的领导方法，不相信其他组织力量，怕党务干部深入支部后没法完成中心工作。因之对支部工作仍不重视。有些区级干部认为不管行政问题就是没权，对深入支部不习惯。这些错误思想，是改变领导方法的重大障碍。因此不少县份在区级领导上，党政不分、党委包办的现象仍很严重。
    另一方面，某些地区党政分开后，形成政权干部和党委脱节现象，甚而闹独立性。有的区委在领导上束手束脚，形成尾巴主义。以上问题。地委、县委应进一步督促检查，深入下层，对区、村干部经常具体帮助，发现问题及时解决，以争取全区领导方法获得彻底转变。
