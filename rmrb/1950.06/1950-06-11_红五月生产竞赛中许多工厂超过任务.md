【Dalian News】 *Lüda People's Daily* reports: The Lüda Far East Light Bulb Factory completed and exceeded its half-year production target by 0.31% on May 23rd, ahead of schedule. Compared with the same period last year, production increased by 184%.

	At the first quarter production summary meeting, all employees of the factory put forward the slogan of striving to complete the half-year production target by May 25th. Workers in various workshops acted under the general slogan, and created new records for increasing production and improving quality. For example, Cui Changmin improved the method of producing large light bulbs, increasing production by 33%. Each machine and each worker formulated monthly, daily, and even hourly production plans, giving everyone clear goals to strive for. The factory also planned the types of products to be manufactured based on the type and quantity of materials in stock, avoiding the phenomenon of work stoppages while waiting for materials. This was also one of the reasons for completing the task ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.
	
	Shanghai Iron and Steel Company Factories
	Average Over-fulfillment by 80%
	
【Shanghai News】 *Liberation Daily* reports: The three factories under the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company successfully concluded the "Red May" production campaign at the end of last month. Each factory created new records. Factory No. 1's monthly output exceeded the campaign target by 81.40%.

	Factory No. 2 exceeded the production target by 69.44%. After the start of the campaign, all employees immediately launched a feverish upsurge in production increase. The workers' division of labor was extremely precise. When the previous shift finished, the next shift immediately took over, not allowing the machines to stand idle for a minute, and fully demonstrated the role of mutual assistance and cooperation.
	
	Factory No. 3's monthly output exceeded the target by 103%. On the 24th of last month, the factory produced five heats of steel, the fastest of which took only 3.53 minutes. In terms of percentage of over-fulfillment, it gloriously won the red flag.
	
	Through the campaign, the labor intensity of the factory's workers has approached the saturation point. For this reason, the company convened a meeting of factory directors, military liaison officers, union representatives, and major engineers on the 26th of last month. On the one hand, it called on all factories to pay attention to labor protection work and to do a good job in employee welfare work in line with the victory of the production increase campaign. On the other hand, it also conducted a detailed discussion and research on the current work and determined the future direction of efforts: to consolidate the achievements already made, focus on improving technology, and further improve product quality and reduce costs. In addition, each factory must prepare to establish regular vocational schools for employees to generally improve the cultural level of workers.
	
	Qingdao Public Enterprises
	Quality Improved, Costs Reduced
	
【Jinan News】 *Dazhong Daily* reports: In the May production campaign, public enterprises in Qingdao generally completed or exceeded their production campaign plans.

The tire workshop of the Qilu Rubber Factory originally planned to produce 68 rubber tubes per day, but actually produced 90. The Sifang Railway Factory exceeded the production target by 29%. Railway transportation exceeded the target by 22%.
	
	The quality of products in various factories has also improved compared with before.

	Datong Factories and Mines Continuously Set New Records
	Exceeding Targets by 30% to 50%
	
【Zhangjiakou News】 *Chahar Daily* reports: In the "May 1st" production campaign, workers in Datong factories and mines generally over-fulfilled their plans by 30% to 50%. The output of Datong Coal Mine has increased every month. The average daily output in February was 1,236 tons. It increased to 1,309 tons in March and 1,505 tons in April. The tunneling rate of the Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu tunneling teams of the Tongjialiang Mine has increased from 60 cm to 110 cm, setting an unprecedented record for the mine and becoming the banner of the miners. Wang Yin, a model worker in the repair department of the Pingwang Power Plant, created the technology of using two knives simultaneously on a lathe, completing 36 hours of switch-hitting work in 9 hours. The Datong Transport Section completed 150,000 kilometers of safe driving, breaking the record of the Japanese puppet era. Guo Quanyi, a typesetting worker at the Datong Printing Bureau, broke the quota of 900 characters per hour and reached 1,200 characters. In terms of carrying out frugality and overcoming waste, there have also been significant achievements. Public factories (excluding Datong Coal Mine) saved a total of 700,000 jin of rice in April, reducing costs by 5%. During the "May 1st" campaign, some deviations also occurred in various factories in the city, such as excessive overtime. These deviations urgently need to be corrected.
