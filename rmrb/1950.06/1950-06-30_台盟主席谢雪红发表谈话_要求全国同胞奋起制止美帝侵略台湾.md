Taiwan League Chairman Xie Xuehong Issues Statement
    Demanding National Compatriots Rise Up to Stop US Imperialist Aggression Against Taiwan
    [Report from this newspaper] Xie Xuehong, Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, issued a written statement on the 29th of this month in response to Premier Zhou's statement, demanding that national and Taiwanese compatriots rise up to defeat US imperialist aggression. The statement is as follows:
    Truman, the ringleader of the imperialist warmongers, and the appearance of his lackey troops in the Taiwan Strait on the 27th, fully exposed the consistent aggressive policy of US imperialism. The Chinese people had long anticipated that US imperialism would take this step. Looking at the recent shady actions of US imperialism in East Asia, one can understand the origins of the enemy's actions today without any explanation. For example, MacArthur, the vanguard of the reactionaries, abused his authority as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan, ordering his running dog, the Yoshida government, to "purge" all members of the Central Committee and members of parliament of the Japanese Communist Party of their political activities without any reason, suppressing the patriotic speeches of Japanese progressives and students, and actively promoting the long-planned rearmament of Japan. Recently, he sent Secretary of Defense Johnson and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley to Japan, attempting to persuade Japan's opposition parties to blindly follow the Yoshida puppet regime's traitorous policy of secretly selling military bases. At the same time, he sent Dulles, a Republican warmongering leader and Special Advisor to the Secretary of State, to visit South Korea to encourage the nearly defunct Syngman Rhee. The next day, the South Korean bandit army brazenly crossed the 38th parallel. Judging from this series of facts alone, would anyone still think that the US imperialist statement and actions were passive? Even a three-year-old child would know that this is one of the steps planned long ago by the White House conspiracy headquarters.
    Therefore, the people of the whole country, especially the compatriots in Taiwan, should rise up together and respond to Premier Zhou's call to use the power of our people to stop "the new aggression of American imperialism in the East" and to guarantee the fact that "Taiwan belongs to China," which "can never be changed."

　　台盟主席谢雪红发表谈话
    要求全国同胞奋起制止美帝侵略台湾
    【本报讯】台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红于本月二十九日发表书面谈话，响应周外长的声明，要求全国和台湾同胞奋起，击败美帝侵略。谈话如下：
    帝国主义战贩的贼魁杜鲁门二十七日的声明，和他的喽啰部队在台湾海峡的出没，十足暴露了美国帝国主义一贯的侵略方针。中国人民早就预料到，美帝必定会走这一步的。试看美帝最近在东亚的鬼祟行动，便可以不解自明地了解敌人今日的行动是由那里来的。比如说，反动派的先锋麦克阿瑟在日本滥用盟军统帅的职权，命令他的走狗吉田政府毫无理由地“整肃”日本共产党全体中央委员及议会议员的政治活动，镇压日本进步人士和学生的爱国言论，积极推进早就计划好了的日本再武装，最近又派国防部长詹逊和参谋会议主席布莱德雷到日本，企图说服日本的在野政党，盲从吉田傀儡政权偷卖军事基地的卖国政策。同时又派共和党的战贩头子，国务卿特别顾问杜勒斯访问南朝鲜，给晚景已近的李承晚打气，第二天南朝鲜的匪军就暴虎凭河地越过三八度线。只就这一连串的事实来判断，难道还有人会认为美帝这次的声明和行动是出于被动的吗？就是三岁的孩子也会知道，这是白宫阴谋总部早就拟好了的步骤之一。
    所以全国人民，特别是台湾同胞应该一齐奋起，起来响应周总理的号召，以我们人民的力量来制止“美国帝国主义在东方的新侵略”，以人民的力量来保证“台湾属于中国”这个“永远不能改变”的事实。
