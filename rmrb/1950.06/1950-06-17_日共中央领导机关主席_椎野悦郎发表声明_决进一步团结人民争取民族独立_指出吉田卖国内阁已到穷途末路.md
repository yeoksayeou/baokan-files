Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 16th: It has been learned here that the Central Leading Organ of the Japanese Communist Party held a special meeting on the 9th. This organ has been fulfilling the functions of the Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party since the previous structure of the Central Committee of the JCP was declared illegal.

After the meeting, Shino Etsuro, Chairman of the Central Leading Organ of the Communist Party, issued the following statement to a reporter from *Akahata* (Red Flag):

(1) Regarding the suppression of our Party. There has been a very erroneous tendency to believe that the purges of our Central Committee members and leading staff of *Akahata* prove that the domestic and foreign reactionary forces have greatly strengthened. However, judging from a common-sense point of view, we can assert that the so-called purging of the Communist Party because domestic and foreign reactionary forces have become stronger is baseless. The situation throughout the world, especially in Asia, shows that the policies pursued by international monopoly capital have failed. They have also encountered significant difficulties in Japanese domestic life. What is particularly noteworthy is that the Yoshida Cabinet's suppression of the Japanese Communist Party shows that the Yoshida Cabinet has reached the end of the road. The Yoshida government launched the suppression of the Communist Party in order to prepare for a new war and to colonize Japan. Now, the preparation for war and the colonization of Japan have caused unemployment and impoverishment among the masses. History teaches us that all plans based on sacrificing the masses are doomed to failure.

Under these circumstances, we should not only not show fear to the enemy, but we must also have full determination to form an alliance with the masses, strengthen the struggle for national independence, for peace, and for maintaining and improving the people's living standards.

Today, we need unity with the masses more than ever before. During the Second World War, our Party protested against the bloodshed, but we were unable to prevent the war because our Party's connection with the people was not strong enough at the time. We are currently facing the danger of a new war, and we must achieve unity with the people; we must win the trust of the masses and work with them to stop the war.

(2) Regarding the lessons of the recent House of Councillors election. The recent election has historical significance for our Party. This election was an extremely important battle, and we waged this battle under the slogans of national independence, defending peace, and protesting war. It is, of course, not surprising that the reactionary forces concentrated their attacks on our Party. But regardless of all the pressure, instigation, and bribery, the masses showed unprecedented determination and voted for our Party.

The candidates from our Party and the united front proposed by our Party in Tokyo and Kyoto obtained a total of approximately 2.83 million votes in local constituencies alone. Although this number is slightly lower than the total of 2.98 million votes our Party received in the previous House of Councillors election, it can still be said that these votes are much stronger in nature.

Regarding our activities in the election, it can be said that although national independence and peace were widely promoted, not enough was done to connect the concrete demands of the masses (regarding low wages, intensified labor, and heavy taxes) with the daily struggles of the masses. Our biggest shortcoming is that we neglected the daily struggles. As a result, our campaign movement was no longer distinguishable from the Socialist Party's propaganda. On the other hand, the content of the propaganda, in terms of nature, became abstract and general. This made it difficult for the masses to draw a clear line between our Party's demands and the Socialist Party's demands. As a result, we lost at least three million votes, which went to the Socialist Party. Our second shortcoming is that we neglected tactics in organizing the masses to seek national independence and defend peace. For example, we concentrated all our attention on strategic goals while neglecting tactical tasks. In any case, the two biases mentioned above are not shortcomings that we only had in the election campaign. In fact, these are shortcomings of all the activities our Party engages in. One of the most important tasks in our Party's current activities should be to completely eliminate these shortcomings. In order to achieve these goals, we must make full use of all the theoretical and practical achievements our Party has gained in the long struggle, and in particular, we must eliminate boastful tones, impetuous, vulgar, and indecisive tendencies in our ranks.

Another shortcoming of our campaign was the emergence of many disagreements and splitting actions. Obviously, the policy of neglecting regular struggles and the theory of "small claims" insisted upon by splitters in the election campaign can only further isolate the party and demoralize the masses. Now, in addition to intensifying suppression measures, the domestic and foreign reactionaries are also attempting to use the party's internal splitting activities. The reactionaries are using splitters as their agents and are attempting to disintegrate the party from within. This is the weapon of suppression used by the ruling class -- sectarianism.

We must consolidate the Party in preparation for the greater struggles that are continuing to develop and carry out the tasks facing our Party. To achieve this goal, we must more strictly observe Party discipline, raise class vigilance, and thoroughly crush the splitters.

Therefore, we must wage a merciless struggle against the splitters, concentrate the thoughts and actions of the entire Party around the new leadership, and advance towards victory.

We look forward to the resolute struggle of the entire Party and the working class.

　　日共中央领导机关主席
    椎野悦郎发表声明
    决进一步团结人民争取民族独立  指出吉田卖国内阁已到穷途末路
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社平壤十六日讯：此间获悉，日本共产党中央领导机关曾于九日举行特别会议，该机关自日共中央委员会以前的构成被宣布为非法以后，即担任中委会、政治局及日共中委会书记处的职权。
    会后，共产党中央领导机关主席椎野悦郎向赤旗报记者发表声明如下：
    （一）关于对我党压制的问题。在认识上曾出现一种非常错误的倾向，认为对我党中央委员及赤旗报领导工作人员的整肃，证明国内外的反动势力已大大加强。然自常识观点判断，我们即可断言所谓整肃共产党是由于国内外反动势力已趋强大一说，乃是毫无根据的。全世界的局势，首先是亚洲各地的局势，显示国际垄断资本所执行的政策，已经失败。他们在日本国内生活中，也遭到重大的困难。尤可注意的是：吉田内阁对日本共产党的镇压，表明吉田内阁已经是到了穷途末路。吉田政府发动对共产党的镇压，为的是要准备新的战争，并把日本殖民地化。现在，战争的准备和日本的殖民地化，已经造成了人民群众的失业和贫困化。历史教训我们：以牺牲人民群众为基础的各种计划，是注定要失败的。
    在这种局势下，我们不但不应向敌人表示畏惧，而且必须具有充分决心，与群众结成同盟，加强争取民族独立、争取和平、保持与提高人民生活水准的斗争。
    我们今日较之以往任何时候都更需要与人民群众的团结。在第二次世界大战中，我党对流血惨事提出抗议，但是并未能避免战争，因为当时我党和人民的联系还不够强。目前我们正面临新战争的危险，我们必须获致与人民的团结；必须赢得群众的信任，并且和他们在一起共同制止战争。
    （二）关于最近一次参议院选举的教训。最近一次选举对我党具有历史性的意义。这次选举是一个极端重要的战斗，我们是在民族独立、保卫和平和抗议战争等口号下进行这战斗的。反动势力把他们的攻击都集中在我党身上，这当然是无足为奇的。但是不管一切压力、挑拨和贿赂，人民群众显示了前所未有的坚定决心，投了我党的票。
    我党在东京和京都两地提出的我党及统一战线候选人，仅在各地方选区中即共取得了约二百八十三万票。虽然这数目比我党在上次参议院选举中所获的总数二百九十八万票略低一点，但是仍然可以说，这些票数在性质上说是坚强得多的。
    对于我们在选举中的活动，可以这样说：虽然曾普遍地宣传民族独立与和平，但是在把群众的具体要求（关于低微工资、劳动强度强化及重税）与群众的日常斗争联系上，做得不够。我们最大的缺点，是我们疏忽了日常斗争。结果，我们的竞选运动与社会党的宣传不再有所区别。而另一方面，宣传的内容，在性质上说，就变成抽象和一般。这使得群众很难在我们党的要求与社会党的要求中间划分出一个明确的界限来。结果，我们失去了至少三百万张选票，这些选票已跑到社会党方面去。我们第二个缺点是：我们在组织群众以谋取民族独立及保卫和平的问题上忽视策略。例如，我们曾把我们的一切注意力集中于战略目的，而忽略了策略任务。无论如何，上面所论及的二种偏向，并不是我们在竞选运动中才有的缺点。事实上，这些是我党所从事的全部活动的缺点。我党目前活动中最重要的任务之一应该是：彻底消灭这些缺点。为了要达到这些目的，我们必须充分利用我党在长期斗争中所获得的一切理论上与实际工作上的成就，特别是必须在我们队伍中戒除矜夸的语调，浮躁的、庸俗的及优柔寡断的倾向。
    我们竞选的另一缺点，就是许多分歧意见和分裂行动的出现。显然地，忽视经常斗争的政策以及分裂分子们在竞选运动中所坚持的“小主张”的理论，只能够更加使党孤立，使群众消沉。现在，国内外的反动派除了加紧进行镇压措施以外，还企图利用党内的分裂活动。反动派利用分裂分子做他们的代理人，正企图从党内来瓦解党。这就是统治阶级利用的镇压武器——宗派主义。
    我们必须巩固党，以备迎接目前正在继续发展中的更大的斗争，并执行我党所面临的这些任务。为了达到这个目的，我们必须更严格地遵守党的纪律，提高阶级警惕，彻底地粉碎分裂分子。
    因此，我们必须对分裂分子进行无情的斗争，将全党的思想与行动集中在新领导机构的周围，向着胜利前进。
    我们期待着全党及工人阶级的坚决的斗争。
