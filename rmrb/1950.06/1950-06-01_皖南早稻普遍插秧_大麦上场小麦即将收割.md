Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 30th: In the vast rural areas of southern Anhui, the transplanting of early rice has generally begun. In counties along the Yangtze River such as Wuhu, Nanling, and Dangtu, the transplanting of early rice is nearing completion. In Qingyang, Guichi, Jingxian and other places, 80% has been transplanted. Thanks to the concrete solutions provided by governments at all levels to address farmers' difficulties in spring plowing, such as the lack of seeds and fertilizers, the farmers' enthusiasm for production is very high. Before and after the emergence of seedlings in the entire region's rice paddies, they were generally plowed twice, and some areas plowed four times. The land reclamation projects in various places have also been mostly completed. The key land reclamation projects in the Wuhu-Dangtu and Chizhou areas are about to be fully completed. The Huizhou area originally planned to repair 105 reclaimed areas, but now 161 have been repaired, benefiting more than 60,000 mu of farmland, which can increase grain production by more than 3.09 million catties. After stepping up plowing and land reclamation, farmers in various places have actively accumulated fertilizer and cultivated wasteland to increase grain production. According to incomplete statistics in the entire region, more than 50,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed, and most areas have been planted with early-maturing crops such as pumpkins, beans, and sesame, preparing to adjust the food rations during the busy farming season in May and June. In order to ensure timely transplanting without missing the season, farmers have organized mutual aid teams for exchanging labor on the basis of the original exchange of labor, and implemented contract farming and assistance for families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, working cadres, and those without labor power. Disaster areas have generally adopted methods such as manual exchange, human-powered plowing, and renting cattle to solve the difficulties of lack of labor and animal power. At present, governments at all levels in southern Anhui are rushing to distribute the remaining loans of grain to help farmers solve the difficulty of lacking food rations during transplanting. At the same time as transplanting, barley, rapeseed, broad beans, etc. have been harvested and threshed in various places, and wheat can also be fully harvested in early June. Many farmers are busy soaking seeds, preparing to plant late rice.

　　皖南早稻普遍插秧
    大麦上场小麦即将收割
    【新华社上海三十日电】皖南广大农村早稻插秧已普遍开始。沿江之芜湖、南陵、当涂等县，早稻插秧已近完成。青阳、贵池、泾县等地已插好百分之八十。由于各级人民政府具体解决了春耕中农民缺乏种籽、肥料等困难，农民的生产情绪很高涨。全区秧田在秧苗出土前后，即普遍犁过两遍，部分地区犁过四遍。各地复圩工程亦已大部修好。芜（湖）当（涂）、池州两专区重点复圩的工程即将全部完工。徽州专区原计划修一零五个圩，现已修好一六一个，受益田亩达六万余亩，可增产粮食三百零九万多斤。各地农民在加紧犁田、复圩之后，纷纷积肥开荒增产粮食。全区据不完全的统计，已开荒五万亩以上，且大部地区已种上南瓜、豆子、芝麻等早熟作物，准备调剂五、六月农忙季节的口粮。为了保证不误季节按时插秧，农民们在旧有拨换工的基础上，组织了相互拨换工的互助组，对革命烈士、军人、工作干部家属及无劳动力者，实行了包耕帮工。灾区普遍采用人工互换、人力拉犁和租牛等办法，解决了缺乏劳动力和畜力的困难。现在皖南各级人民政府正在赶发未贷放完毕的粮食，帮助农民解决插秧中缺乏口粮的困难。与插秧同时，各地大麦、油菜、蚕豆等已收割上场，小麦于六月初旬亦可全面收割，很多农民已在忙着浸种，准备种晚稻。
