Guangdong Zhongshan County Neglects Grain Storage
Loss of Public Grain Reaches One Million Jin
County Government and Grain Bureau Conducted Self-Criticism

[Guangzhou News] According to the Southern Daily, Guangdong's Zhongshan County neglected the storage of public grain, resulting in serious losses of state property. Since the collection of public grain, up to early April, the amount of grain that had heated up, became moldy, or was lost due to embezzlement and fraud reached more than one million jin in just two districts. Currently, the county People's Government and the Grain Bureau have conducted self-criticism and requested punishment from higher authorities.

The reason why the county's public grain suffered such serious losses is mainly due to the insufficient attention paid by the leading organs to the storage of public grain. For example, in the ninth district, over 790,000 jin of public grain were stored in Rongqi. When the Zhujiang Prefectural Commissioner sent people to inspect it in late March, it was discovered that all of it was heating up, and some parts had sprouted from an inch to three or four inches. However, the actual amount of the loss was never accurately reported afterward, nor was responsibility pursued. Also, in that district, at the end of December last year, more than 271,000 jin of public grain were stored at a private rice mill. It was not until late March of this year that an inspection was carried out. After that, no further attention was paid. The rice mill owner then took the public grain to rent rice mills, buy tools, and hire workers. Later, when the district government wanted him to mill more than 89,000 jin of rice, the rice became moldy because it was not extracted in time. Because appropriate measures were not taken at the time, it was not until rice was needed for the Hainan campaign that it was discovered that more than 70,000 jin of rice were missing. However, this matter was also delayed and not dealt with. Furthermore, in Da Huangpu (belonging to the ninth district), more than 800,000 jin of public grain were also stored in a rice mill. Apart from most of it being taken away successively, more than 184,000 jin had not been taken away. The shop manager, Huang Guocai, embezzled the money and absconded, causing the stored public grain to suffer losses. However, two or three months later, the amount of the loss had still not been reported, and the county government had not dealt with it. Similar situations are common in other places. Currently, the Zhongshan County People's Government and the Grain Bureau have conducted self-criticism on the above serious loss incidents. In addition to making a written self-examination to the Zhujiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office on April 30, they believe that this is a manifestation of a lack of a high sense of responsibility towards the country and the people and requested punishment while guaranteeing to overcome past shortcomings with the greatest effort. The Southern Daily attaches great importance to this kind of major loss of state property. On May 11, while publishing the news in a prominent position, it also published an editorial, pointing out that the main reason for the loss of public grain is that leading cadres have not paid enough attention to the storage and transportation of public grain and have not treated this work as a major political task to be completed. Staff members are exhausted and lax and turn a blind eye to the loss of state and people's property. Therefore, it calls on party and government leaders at all levels and all public grain protection and transportation workers to pay more attention and fight to prevent the loss and waste of public grain.

　　广东中山县忽视粮食保管
    损失公粮达百万斤       
    县府和粮食局已作检讨
    【广州讯】据南方日报消息：广东中山县忽视公粮保管，致使国家财富遭受严重损失。自征收以来，截至四月上旬止，仅两个区发热、霉坏以及被贪污拐骗而受损失之粮食即达百余万斤。现该县人民政府及粮食局已作检讨，并向上级请求处分。
    该县公粮所以遭受如此严重损失，主要是领导机关对公粮保管重视不够。如九区寄存容奇公粮七十九万余斤，至三月下旬珠江专署派员检查时，即已发现全部发热，局部已出芽寸许至三四寸不等。但究竟损失多少，其后一直未确实报告，亦未追究责任。又如该区去年十二月底将公粮二十七万一千多斤存于私人米机商处，直到今年三月下旬才去检查过一次，以后即不闻不问，该米机商遂将公粮拿去租米机、买工具、雇工人。后来区政府要其辗米八万九千余斤，因未及时提取，米便发生霉坏。当时因未作适当处理，直到海南战役要碾米支前，才发觉米已亏空七万多斤，但此事也拖延未作处理。再如大黄圃（属九区）亦将公粮八十余万斤存放米机商处，除先后已提走大部外，尚于十八万四千余斤未提走，该店司理黄国材因亏空过大，卷款潜逃，寄存之公粮，便因之遭受损失。但究竟损失多少，二、三个月后，仍未呈报，该县府对此亦未处理。类似的情况在各地还有很多。现中山县人民政府及粮食局对以上严重损失事件已作检讨，除在四月三十日向珠江专署作了书面的反省，认为这是对国家、对人民缺乏高度责任心的表现，并请求给予处分，同时保证以最大努力克服过去的缺点。南方日报对此种重大的国家财产的损失事件，极为重视，于五月十一日以显著地位发表该项新闻的同时，特发表社论，指出公粮损失的主要原因是领导干部对于公粮的保管运输没有足够的重视，没有把这件工作当作一件重大的政治任务去完成，工作人员疲塌松懈，对国家人民财产损失熟视无睹等。因此，号召各级党、政领导及全体公粮保运工作人员，加强注意，为防止公粮的损失与浪费而斗争。
