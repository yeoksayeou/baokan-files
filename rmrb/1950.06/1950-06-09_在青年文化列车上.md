On the Youth Culture Train
Song Xiuye

The colorful Youth Culture Train departed from Beijing on March 25th.

When the train arrived at Fangshun Bridge, the staff at the station welcomed us with gongs and drums. Unfortunately, time was too short, and we only sang a few songs and danced a Yangge before the train departed. At Qingfengdian, a crowd of five or six hundred people thronged around. The comrades didn't have time to put on makeup, so they picked up waist drums and started drumming. Because of the limited stop time, there wasn't time to perform a play, so they extracted the most exciting part of "Glorious Lamp" to sing.

The comrades of the Baoshi Section of the Tianjin Engineering Department completed the task of unloading materials ahead of schedule in order to see the performance of the cultural train. The dirt mounds and beaches immediately became our stage, and the warm sun became beautiful lighting.

At 7:35 a.m., upon arriving in Ding County, we saw the platform was full of people from afar, with red flags waving in the wind. We all thought a mass meeting was being held! As the train approached the platform, the old union chairman, Comrade Yu Baoli, had already organized his team and spoke to us with several representatives: "We have one hour here, and we hope you can perform for us quickly."

The temporary stage was set up on the basketball court, and in less than five minutes, the area was surrounded on all sides.

All the comrades on the train were happy to prepare for the joyous day of the opening of the Luoyang Yellow River Bridge. Writing scripts, setting up the stage, making scenery... everyone forgot their fatigue.

In order to perform the newly written script "Luoyang Yellow River Bridge" even better, they went to the site to experience life. The female comrades also helped to lift steel rails and install sleepers. During rehearsals, soldiers were invited to be directors.

On the evening of April 7th, at the opening ceremony, a vivid scene of the construction of the Luoyang Yellow River Bridge was performed. When the model train on the stage passed through the "British military" flower bridge steel beam, the audience burst into applause, and every soldier's heart was boiling - this is the largest bridge we built on the Longhai Railway for the new motherland!

The comrades of the cultural train went to the troops, lived with the soldiers, helped the soldiers learn culture, write scripts, sing songs, sew clothes... and finally performed together. Before leaving, the soldiers lined up to see them off; afterwards, the soldiers sent many moving letters. Soldier Zhang Minghe wrote in his poem:

Comrades of the cultural train,
Came to the Luoyang Yellow River Bridge from Beijing.
From that day on,
They became one with us;
Hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder with us,
Participated in on-site labor and did the same work.

At the "May Fourth" model worker conference in Zhengzhou, the comrades of the cultural train sang about the heroes of the model worker conference, "Mao Zedong Locomotive" and "Wang Tianming Who Created the Air Brake Test Bench." The workers paid tribute to the cultural train in the newspaper. They hoped to plant the banner of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers all the way to Taiwan, and sing and perform music and dramas loved by workers and peasants in Taiwan.

The Mao Zedong Locomotive and the Youth Culture Train met. Li Yong, the heroic driver of the Mao Zedong Locomotive, told everyone stories about going abroad and reported on materials; the cultural train taught them songs. On the sand pile next to the train, labor heroes and young literary and art workers held a warm gathering. The Mao Zedong Locomotive presented the cultural train with a red flag, which read:

"You are the locomotives of Chinese youth, spreading the songs of victory throughout China."

All the comrades of the cultural train expressed: "Wherever the Mao Zedong Locomotive goes, the cultural train will follow."

    在青年文化列车上
    宋修业
    彩色的青年文化列车，三月二十五日从北京出发。
    列车开到方顺桥，员工们在车站上敲起锣鼓欢迎我们，可惜时间太短，只唱了几个歌，跳了一个秧歌舞，车就开了。到清风店时，群众一拥五六百人。同志们来不及化装，背起腰鼓就打，因为停车时间有限，来不及演一个剧，抽出《光荣灯》中最精采的一段来演唱。
    天津工务段保石段的同志们，为要看到文化列车的演出，提前完成了卸材料的任务；土岗、沙滩、立即变成了我们的舞台，温暖的太阳变成了美丽的灯光。
    七时三十五分至定县，远远的就望见月台上站满了人，红旗迎风招展。我们都以为是在开什么群众大会啦！车行至站台前时，老工会主席于保礼同志，早已整理好了他的队伍，与几位代表和我们说了话：“这里停车一小时，希望你们很快的给我们表演。”
    临时舞台设在篮球场，不到五分钟，场外围了个四面不透风。

    全列车的同志们，都为了准备洛河正桥通车的喜日而高兴。写剧本、装舞台、制布景……大家忘记了疲劳。
    为了把刚写好的《洛河桥》剧本演的更好，下到现场体验生活，女同志们也帮助抬钢轨、装枕木。在排演时，把战士请来做导演。
    四月七日，在通车典礼的晚上，演出了洛河正桥建筑的生动场面。当舞台上的模型火车通过“英国军用”花桥钢梁时，台下掌声雷动，每个战士的心里都在沸腾着——这是我们为新生的祖国在陇海路上建筑的最大的第一座桥梁啊！

    文化列车的同志们下到部队里，和战士在一起生活，帮助战士学文化、写剧本、唱歌、缝衣服……最后在一起演出。临别时，战士们列队欢送；别后，战士们寄来了不少动人的信件。战士张明和的诗歌中这样写着：
    文化列车同志们，
    从北京来到洛河桥边。
    从那天起，
    就和我们打成一片；
    和我们手携手、肩并肩，
    参加现场劳动一样把活干。
    …………………………

    在郑州市“五四”劳模大会上，文化列车的同志们演唱了劳模会上的英雄《毛泽东号机车》和《创造风闸试验台的王天明》。职工们在报纸上向文化列车致敬。他们希望把文艺为工农兵服务的旗帜，一直插到台湾去，把工农喜爱的音乐和戏剧，唱到台湾去，演到台湾去。

    毛泽东号机车和青年文化列车会合了。毛泽东号的司机长李永老英雄给大家讲出国的故事，报告材料；文化列车给他们教歌。在列车旁边的沙堆上，劳动英雄们和青年文艺工作者举行了热烈的联欢会。毛泽东号机车并赠给文化列车红旗一面，写着：
    “你们是中国青年的火车头，把胜利的歌唱遍全中国。”
    文化列车的全体同志表示：“毛泽东号机车开到那里，文化列车跟到那里。”
