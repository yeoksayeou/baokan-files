    [This Newspaper News] This newspaper special correspondent Wang Jingran reported: The cash management work in major cities and provinces across the country has achieved remarkable results. Since the State Council and the People's Bank of China headquarters jointly issued the cash management order on April 7, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and various provinces and cities have successively deployed its implementation in April and May. Although the time has been short, significant results have been achieved. In addition to absorbing a large amount of funds, thereby reversing the situation of using currency issuance to make up for fiscal deficits in previous years, as of May 15, the deposits of national banks have reached 323.4 percent of the amount before the National Financial Conference. This makes it possible to carry out production support in a calm, planned, and focused manner. The specific achievements of cash management work are reflected in the following aspects:

    First, the strengthening of transfer business has greatly saved unnecessary cash receipts and payments. Taking the Shanghai Branch as an example of the increase in the number of transfers in national banks, in February, the total amount of transfers was 15.67 times that of cash receipts and payments, which increased to 30.88 times in April; in March, the Nanjing Branch had transfers and cash each accounting for half, and in April, transfers were 11.5 times that of cash receipts and payments; at the beginning of April, the Shandong Provincial Branch had transfers twice the amount of cash, and by the end of April, it reached 16.97 times; in mid-May, the amount of transfers in Tianjin and Xi'an was about 6.8 times the amount of cash; during the same period, Hankou was 6.5 times, Guangzhou was 3.7 times, Beijing was 2.4 times, and in April, Xuzhou's transfer inflows and outflows were about 2.5 times the cash inflows and outflows. The increase in the number of transfers indicates a great saving in the use of currency.

    Secondly, due to the implementation of cash management, the money supply in the market has tightened, prices have stabilized and fallen, and speculative transactions have been greatly reduced, thus the number of bill exchanges in major cities has decreased. Taking the four major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan as an example, if the number and amount of bill exchanges in March are taken as 100, then the number in April dropped to 70.8, the amount dropped to 79.6, the number in May dropped to 67.6, and the amount was 83.8; among them, except for Shanghai, almost all showed a monthly decrease, with Beijing's decrease of more than one-third being the largest. However, on the other hand, the number of bills used by the People's Bank of China has greatly increased. According to Nanjing statistics, the number of receipts and payments has increased by more than ten times. Due to the relative slowdown in the speed of currency circulation, the deposit base of national banks has become wider, and the storage time for the general public has also lengthened. Therefore, the cash reserve ratio of banks (i.e., the amount prepared for depositors' withdrawals) can also be reduced. For example, in the entire East China region, the proportion of inventory to deposits decreased from 26.13 percent on April 1 to 15.5 percent on the 15th. As another example, the Shanghai Branch reduced by 14 percent in April compared to last year and was sufficient to guarantee payments at any time. This allows a large amount of cash to be used for production investment.

    Thirdly, it can save manpower, promote business operations, and strengthen planning. For agencies and enterprises other than banks, it saves the number of cashier personnel. Taking Qingdao as an example, eight units, including the Qingdao Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, saved more than 60 cashier personnel. Estimating the expenditure of 300,000 yuan per person per month, it saves more than 10 million yuan. On the other hand, for national banks, in addition to some tension in accounting transfers, a large amount of cash is no longer moved around, which also saves a lot of manpower. The situation in the business department of the Nanjing Branch: "With the same number of people handling the same amount of receipts and payments, they were so busy day and night in the past, but now they seem leisurely." Some personnel can be transferred to enrich the lower-level institutions under their jurisdiction. Moreover, after the implementation of cash management, some units not only strengthen their own planning but can also "serve as capable assistants to promote lower-level institutions." For example, the financial situation of a department in Xi'an had always been chaotic for more than eight months after liberation. If the income was good, they would buy a lot of materials and equipment that were not needed. If the income was not good, they would have to ask the higher authorities for appropriations to cover expenses. This unreasonable phenomenon has now been fundamentally overcome. In the April plan of a department in Shanghai, there was originally a shortage of 12 billion yuan, which needed to be resolved by borrowing. After the implementation of cash management, not only was there no borrowing, but there was a deposit of 13 billion yuan.

    Experience in Cash Management Work

    From the above situations, local banks have generally gained the following experiences and understandings regarding this new work:

    First of all, at the beginning of the implementation, some people regarded this work as "purely technical," and some even said that this was the national bank's way of attracting money to do business. Of course, some people also worried that the bank would be "too strict," "inconvenient," and "inflexible," and some even ignored it, with a smug attitude of "the bank can't control me!"

    Naturally, cash management is a new task, and everyone lacks experience. Moreover, a series of objective difficulties such as "few people," "many things," "long distances," and "complicated procedures" do exist. However, on the whole, the advantages of implementation outweigh the difficulties, and the difficulties can be overcome. This has been repeatedly mentioned in many documents: In economic construction, the role played by the national bank and the relevant agencies and enterprises is an inseparable whole. The national financial capital and the production and operation of national enterprises are closely related. The national bank must become a cash center in order to effectively use the funds for large-scale economic construction and maintain normal currency circulation, and to normalize prices. Without this, it is not enough to guarantee production, and it is difficult to strengthen the strong strength of the national economy. Therefore, this is not only a "simple technical issue" or "attracting deposits to do business." It is even less about "tightening." Everything is to make enterprises "account for costs according to costs" and "operate according to plans," so that they can get on the right track, rationalize as soon as possible, and avoid grabbing and buying randomly in the market, and contribute to stabilizing market prices.

    Secondly, according to initial experience in various places, the promotion must be carried out step by step through publicity and mobilization, key visits, and soliciting opinions to dispel many unnecessary concerns in thinking. The implementation will be more effective, otherwise, there will be more ideological resistance. Of course, in addition to this, a humble and sincere work style is also needed, as well as detailed and in-depth specific assistance. Relying solely on "orders" and "decisions" will lead to greater difficulties and twists and turns. Although after the National Financial Conference, various places have made significant improvements after reversing bureaucratism and the style of government agencies. For example, in Xi'an, the procedures that originally required more than a dozen steps can now be completed in seven to ten minutes after reduction. For example, the Tianjin Branch has set up an inquiry office, the Beijing Branch has opened a telephone service, and the Hubei Branch has established a mobile service team, etc., all of which have helped promote this work. However, it is obviously not enough to be satisfied with this. The business style must be continuously improved. For example, Tianjin discovered that the preparation work was insufficient, and the leaders immediately personally supervised and inspected it, and sent people to collect opinions from all sides, and promptly improved it. Even some unsatisfactory reactions can gradually become satisfactory, and the blind can become unblind.

### 全国现金管理成效显著  转账增加现金收付节省  国家银行大量资金可用于扶植生产

    全国现金管理成效显著
    转账增加现金收付节省
    国家银行大量资金可用于扶植生产
    【本报讯】本报特约通讯员王静然报道：全国各大城市及各省市现金管理工作已有显著成绩。自四月七日政务院及人民银行总行联合发布现金管理命令后，于四、五两月份内京、津、沪、汉以及各省市均先后布置执行，至今为时虽短，但已收到显著成效。除吸收大批资金，从而扭转了历年来用发行弥补财政赤字的情况外，截至五月十五日止，国家银行的存款已相当全国金融会议前的百分之三二三·四，这样就能从容的有计划、有重点地进行扶植生产了。现金管理工作的具体成绩表现在以下几个方面：
    首先是由于转账业务的加强，大大节省了不必要的现金收付。国家银行转账数字增加的例子，以上海分行来说，二月份收付总额中，转账为现金收付的一五·六七倍，四月份增加到三○·八八倍；南京分行三月份转账与现金各半，四月份转账为现金收付的一一·五倍；山东省分行四月初转账为现金的二倍，四月底达到一六·九七倍；天津、西安五月份中旬转账金额约为现金金额的六·八倍；同时期汉口为六·五倍，广州为三·七倍，北京为二·四倍，徐州四月份转账出入约为现金出入的二·五倍，转账数字的增加说明了通货的使用大为节省。
    其次是由于实行现金管理后，市面银根紧缩，物价稳落，投机交易大大减少，因而各主要城市的票据交换数字有所降低。以京、津、沪、汉四大城市来说，如以三月份票据交换张数、金额为一○○，则四月份张数即降至七○·八，金额降至七九·六，五月份张数即降至六七·六，金额为八三·八；其中除上海之外，几乎全是逐月递减的，以北京减三分之一以上为最大。但另一方面，通过人民银行使用其票据的数字却大为增加，据南京统计，收付数字约增加十倍以上。就由于通货流通速度的相对减缓，国家银行的存款面就更加广阔，且一般人存储时间也长了，因之银行的现金备提（即准备存户提存的款额）准备额亦可减小。如华东全区库存占存款之比例，由四月一日的百分之二六·一三降为十五日的百分之一五·五，又如上海分行，四月份较去年减低了百分之十四且足以保证随时支付。使大量现金可以用之于作生产投资。
    其三是可以节省人力，促进企业经营，加强计划性。对于银行以外的其他机关企业，节省了出纳人员，如以青岛为例，该市花纱布公司等八个单位即省去出纳六十余人，每人每月以三十万元开支估计，即省去一千余万元。另一方面，在国家银行来说，除了会计上转账有所紧张之外，大批现金再不搬来搬去也相对省去了不少人力，如南京的分行营业部情况：“同数人员同量收付，过去夜以继日忙碌不堪，现却显得清闲。”可以抽调出一部分人员，去充实所属下层机构。又有些单位实行现金管理后，不仅本身计划性加强，且可以“作为推动下级机构得力助手”。如西安某部门，解放后八个多月来，财务状况始终紊乱，收入好，即买很多材料装置品，摆起用不着，收入不好，又要请上级拨款开支，此种不合理现象，现已得到根本克服。上海某部门，在四月份计划中，原缺头寸一百二十亿，须要借款解决，现金管理实行后不但没有借款，反而有存款一百三十亿。
    现金管理工作的经验
    从上述一些情况中，各地银行对于这项新的工作，大体上有以下的体会和经验：
    首先是在实行之初，有一部分人对这项工作认为是“纯技术的”，甚至有人说这是国家银行要拉款做生意。当然也有的人顾虑怕银行“卡”得太紧，“不方便”、“不机动”，甚至有的漠然置之，大有“银行管不着我！”的神气。
    自然，现金管理是个新工作，大家没有经验，而且“人少”、“事多”、“路远”、“手续繁”等一连串客观困难确实存在；但从整体上说，执行起来总是好处多而困难又是可以被克服的。这在许多文件中均已再三再四讲到：经济建设中，国家银行与各有关机关企业所发挥的作用，正是不可分割的一个整体，国家金融资本与国家企业生产经营是血肉相关的。国家银行要成为现金中心，才能有效地使大规模经济建设的资金敷用与正常的保持货币流通，并使物价趋向正常，不如此不足以保证生产，不如此也难能壮大国民经济的雄厚实力。因之，这不仅不是“简单的技术问题”，也不是“拉存款做生意”。更谈不上“卡紧”，一切都是为了使企业“核算要按成本”、“经营要有计划”，使其早日走上正规化、合理化，并避免在市场上乱抓乱买，给稳定市场物价尽一份力。
    其次根据各地初步经验，推行必须有步骤地进行宣传动员、重点访问、征询意见、从思想上解除许多不必要的顾虑。实行起来效果才能好，否则，所遇思想抵抗就较多。当然除此之外，还需要虚心诚恳的工作作风，还需要细致、深入的具体帮助，如只靠“命令”、“决定”，遭遇的困难和周折就会更大更多。虽然在全国金融会议后，各地经过了反机关化、反官僚主义作风，已经有了显著的改进。如西安原来须经过十几个过程的手续，减少后七至十分钟即可处理完毕；又如天津分行专设问事处，北京分行开办电话服务，湖北分行设立流动服务组等等；都有助于这项工作的推进。但只满足于这一点显然还是不够的。业务作风尚须不断改进，如天津发觉准备工作不足，立时由领导人亲自督促检查，并派人四出搜集意见，并及时加以改进，即使有些不满意的反应，也可以渐次变为满意的，盲目的也可以变为不盲目的。
