　　The Korean People Fight for National Reunification
    Liu Guiliang
    In late June 1949, representatives from 71 democratic political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea, led by the Workers' Parties of North and South Korea, held a conference in Pyongyang, the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to establish the Fatherland Unification Democratic Front. Based on the proposal of the Korean Workers' Party, they unanimously adopted a program and declaration for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, fully reflecting the will of all Korean people. The declaration stated:
    "The Korean people oppose civil war. We are unwilling to shed blood for the benefit of American monopoly capitalists and national traitors. The Korean people must use their own strength to reunify the fatherland peacefully, and they will certainly be able to achieve it."
    The Fatherland Front called on the people of North and South Korea to rise up in unity under the banner of the Fatherland Front to expel the U.S. imperialist troops and the illegal "United Nations Commission on Korea," overthrow the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, hold general elections on a democratic basis, and achieve the peaceful reunification of the country.
    This just call immediately received the enthusiastic support of the people throughout the country. An unprecedented patriotic upsurge for national peaceful reunification unfolded in North and South Korea. In South Korea, a general strike was launched by the broad masses of workers on July 20th, people's guerrilla units continuously attacked major cities, peasants launched large-scale uprisings, and officers and soldiers of the puppet "National Defense Army" constantly revolted. This surging movement greatly shocked U.S. imperialism and its Syngman Rhee puppet clique.
    Under the pressure of the entire Korean people, U.S. imperialism had no choice but to verbally announce the withdrawal of troops, but it left behind a so-called "military advisory group" of 500 people, and intensified its instigation of the Syngman Rhee puppet government to massacre the people and provoke civil war. As of the end of June this year, the total amount of military and economic "aid" provided by U.S. imperialism to Syngman Rhee had reached over 730 million U.S. dollars, and it was decided to provide another 100 million U.S. dollars in the coming year. From February of last year to January of this year, the amount of U.S. aid materials shipped to Busan Port reached a staggering 1,112,702 tons.
    In order to undermine the realization of the peaceful reunification plan put forward by the Fatherland Front, the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, on the one hand, under the direct command of the American "military advisory group," launched a large-scale offensive against the people's guerrilla units. At the same time, they used all kinds of brutal means to suppress the patriotic struggle of the broad masses of the people, preparing the rear for launching a civil war. In the four years from 1945 to 1949, a total of more than 149,000 patriotic people were massacred. In the six months after the establishment of the Fatherland Front alone, more than 62,000 patriotic people were massacred. And in the past four years, nearly 500,000 patriots have been arrested and imprisoned. On the other hand, Syngman Rhee's puppet army constantly carried out armed provocations along the 38th parallel, the dividing line between North and South, clamoring for a "northern expedition" and attempting to turn the entire Korea into a colony of U.S. imperialism and a military base for aggression against the Far East. From January of last year to April of this year alone, the Syngman Rhee bandit army launched 1,274 attacks along the 38th parallel. From January to September of last year, there were 71 air raids and 42 fleet attacks.
    Syngman Rhee once openly declared: "When the division between North and South must be resolved by war, we will engage in all the wars that are needed." He also said that a "northern expedition" must be carried out in 1950 to "unify the territory." Shin Sung-mo, the puppet "Minister of National Defense," even arrogantly clamored: "The 38th parallel is America's Far East anti-communist line. After occupying Pyongyang and Wonsan, this line can be moved north. Now all preparations have been made to recover the lost territories. As long as the President issues an order, Pyongyang and Wonsan can be completely occupied within a day." Baek Seong-uk, the puppet "Minister of Home Affairs," said even more blatantly that the "38th parallel issue" would be resolved in "June or July of this year."
    Frenzied clamoring was accompanied by actual preparations for war. After Syngman Rhee signed the so-called "ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" with the United States on January 26 this year, he went to Tokyo on February 16 and concluded a secret military agreement with the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan, recruiting Japanese soldiers to South Korea to help him launch a civil war.
    It is particularly noteworthy that in April and May of this year, the Syngman Rhee puppet government had already concentrated five of its eight infantry divisions on the 38th parallel, and constantly carried out armed provocations, firing incendiary bombs into the forested areas north of the 38th parallel, attempting to take the opportunity to invade the counties of Cheorwon, Hwacheon, and Yeoncheon in Gangwon Province, and the counties of Yeonbaek and Byeokseong in Hwanghae Province. However, these intrusions were all repelled by the North Korean border guards.
    The enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, held on June 7 this year, issued a letter to all democratic political parties, social organizations, and the people of North and South Korea, and once again put forward a concrete plan for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, calling on all Korean people to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation with the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The main contents of the plan are: hold general elections throughout Korea from August 5th to 8th to establish a unified supreme legislative body. The first meeting of this supreme legislative body will be held in Seoul on the fifth anniversary of "August 15th." Before the general elections are held, a consultative conference attended by representatives from democratic political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea who support peaceful reunification will be held in Haeju north of the 38th parallel or Kaesong south of the 38th parallel from June 15th to 17th to discuss the procedures for the general elections and other issues. However, the culprits who have consistently undermined the country's peaceful reunification and the national traitors Syngman Rhee, Lee Bum-suk, Kim Seong-su, Shin Sung-mo, Cho Byeong-ok, Chae Byeong-deok, Baek Seong-uk, Yoon Chi-young, and Shin Heung-woo, etc., shall not participate in the consultative conference.
    After the letter to the people was issued, it received the enthusiastic support and endorsement of the people throughout Korea, just like when the Fatherland Front was established a year ago. However, the loyal dog of U.S. imperialism, the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, ordered the implementation of "extraordinary alert" along the 38th parallel and throughout South Korea, closely monitoring the actions of various political parties, social organizations, and democratic figures from all walks of life in South Korea, preventing the convening of the North-South representative consultative conference. Chae Byeong-deok, the puppet Army Chief of Staff, openly declared: "The peaceful reunification advocated by the Fatherland Front cannot be tolerated." Shin Sung-mo, the puppet Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, clamored that in view of the current so-called "emergency situation," the Syngman Rhee government "is considering issuing a national mobilization order." The notorious American warmonger Dulles rushed to South Korea on the 17th to "inspect" the 38th parallel, where U.S. imperialism and its lackey Syngman Rhee were actively provoking civil war, instructing Syngman Rhee to launch a civil war in order to undermine the realization of the peaceful reunification plan proposed by the Fatherland Front.
    Due to the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique's utmost obstruction, the North-South representative consultative conference, originally scheduled to be held from June 15th to 17th, was sabotaged. The three representatives sent by the Fatherland Front to Seoul to deliver the letter to the people to various democratic political parties, social organizations, and democratic figures from all walks of life in South Korea were arrested by Syngman Rhee and their whereabouts are still unknown.
    To this end, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, accepting the request of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, passed a decision on the 19th, requesting the South Korean "National Assembly" to arrest the national traitors Syngman Rhee, Kim Seong-su, and others who undermined the country's peaceful reunification, and to negotiate with the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly on the issue of peaceful reunification of North and South Korea. However, the South Korean "National Assembly" has not yet responded, while the South Korean puppet army launched a full-scale invasion into areas north of the 38th parallel at dawn on the 25th.
    The great Soviet army ended the half-century of colonial rule of Korea by Japanese imperialism, bringing the Korean people the hope of national independence, unification, democracy, and prosperity. However, U.S. imperialism and its lackey Syngman Rhee have divided Korea, destroying this hope. Under the bloody rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackey Syngman Rhee clique, the national economy of South Korea is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the people are living in hunger and terror. In North Korea, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the leader of the Korean people, General Kim Il-sung, various democratic reforms have been carried out, two one-year economic plans have been completed, a two-year economic plan is about to be completed, and another three-year economic plan will begin. The material and cultural life of the people is improving day by day. In the stark contrast between North and South, the Korean people have fully realized who their enemies are and who their saviors are. Especially in the year since the establishment of the Fatherland Front, the democratic forces of North and South Korea, united under the banner of the Fatherland Front, have become stronger, while the Syngman Rhee bandit gang traitorous clique has become more isolated. Just as the statement of the Fatherland Front pointed out: No matter how frantically the Syngman Rhee bandit gang struggles under the direction of its American masters, its attempts to provoke civil war and undermine the country's peaceful reunification will never succeed. The doomsday of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang is not far away.

　　朝鲜人民为祖国统一而斗争
    刘桂梁
    一九四九年六月下旬，以南北朝鲜的劳动党为首的南北朝鲜七十一个民主政党与社会团体的代表，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的首都平壤举行了祖国统一民主主义战线成立大会，并根据朝鲜劳动党的提议，一致通过了和平统一祖国的纲领和宣言，这充分反映了全朝鲜人民的意愿。宣言写道：
    “朝鲜人民反对内战，我们不愿意为美国独占资本家与民族叛徒们的利益而流血。朝鲜人民必须用自己的力量以和平的方法来统一祖国，而且一定能够实现它。”
    祖国战线号召南北朝鲜人民一致奋起，团结在祖国战线的旗帜下，把美帝国主义的驻军与非法的“联合国朝鲜委员会”驱逐出境，打倒李承晚傀儡政权，在民主的基础上举行总选举，实现国家的和平统一。
    这一正义的号召提出后，立即获得全国人民的热烈拥护。南北朝鲜各地展开了一个争取国家和平统一的空前的爱国热潮，南朝鲜广大工人在七月二十日举行了总罢工，人民游击队连续袭击大城市，农民们发动了大规模起义运动，伪“国防军”官兵不断起义。这一澎湃的运动使美帝国主义及其李承晚傀儡集团极为震惊。
    在全朝鲜人民的压力下，美帝国主义虽不得不在口头上宣布撤兵，但却留下了一个五百人的所谓“军事顾问团”，变本加厉地唆使李承晚傀儡政府屠杀人民，挑拨内战。截至今年六月底止，美帝国主义给予李承晚的军事和经济“援助”总额已达七亿三千万美元以上，并决定今后一年中再给予一亿美元。去年二月至今年一月，运到釜山港的美援物资，共达一百一十一万二千七百零二吨之巨。
    李承晚卖国集团为了破坏祖国战线所提出的和平统一方案的实现，一方面在美国“军事顾问团”的直接指挥下大举进攻人民游击队，同时又用尽一切残暴手段，镇压广大人民的爱国斗争，为发动内战准备后方。从一九四五年到一九四九年的四年中，一共屠杀了爱国人民十四万九千余人，仅在祖国战线成立后的半年中，就屠杀了爱国人民达六万二千余人。而四年来爱国人士被逮捕囚禁者几达五十万人。另一方面，李承晚的伪军不断地在南北交界线的三八线积极进行武装挑衅，叫嚣“北伐”，妄图将全部朝鲜变为美帝国主义的殖民地和侵略远东的军事基地。仅在去年一月至今年四月，李承晚匪军在三八线沿线即发动了一千二百七十四次进攻，去年一月至九月，进行了七十一次空袭和四十二次舰队袭击。
    李承晚曾公然宣称：“南北的分裂，等到必须以战争来解决时，我们将从事所需要的一切战争。”他并说一九五○年一定要进行“北伐”，“统一国土”。伪“国防长官”申性模竟狂妄地叫嚣：“三八线是美国的远东防共线，等到占领平壤和元山后，这一线就可以北移。现在已有恢复失地的一切准备，只要总统下一道命令，一天内就能完全占领平壤和元山。”伪“内务长官”白性郁更明目张胆地说：要在“今年的六七月间解决三八线问题”。
    疯狂的叫嚣伴随着备战的实际行动。李承晚在今年一月二十六日与美国签订所谓“韩美联防互助协定”之后，二月十六日又到东京与日本吉田反动政府缔结了军事密约，招募日军到南朝鲜帮助他发动内战。
    特别值得注意的是，今年四五月间李承晚傀儡政府已将其陆军八个步兵师团中的五个师团调集在三八线，并不断进行武装挑衅，向三八线以北的山林地带发射烧夷弹，企图乘机侵入江原道的铁原、桦川、涟川与黄海道的延白、碧城等县境，但这些侵扰均被北朝鲜的警备队击退。
    今年六月七日召开的祖国战线中央委员会扩大会议，发表了告南北朝鲜各民主政党社会团体与全国人民书，再度提出祖国和平统一的具体方案，号召全朝鲜人民以祖国的和平统一来纪念“八、一五”解放五周年。方案的主要内容是：八月五日至八日在全朝鲜举行总选举，成立统一的最高立法机关。这一最高立法机关的首届会议于“八、一五”五周年纪念日在汉城举行。在举行总选举之前，于六月十五日至十七日在三八线以北的海州或三八线以南的开城，召开一个由赞成和平统一的南北朝鲜各民主政党与社会团体代表参加的协商会议，讨论总选举的程序等问题。但一贯破坏国家和平统一的罪魁及民族叛徒李承晚、李范奭、金性洙、申性模、赵炳玉、蔡秉德、白性郁、尹致暎、申兴雨等，不得参加协商会议。
    告人民书发表后，像一年前祖国战线成立时一样，受到全朝鲜人民的热烈拥护与支持。但是美帝国主义的忠实走狗李承晚卖国集团，却下令在三八线沿线及南朝鲜全部地区，施行“非常警戒”，严密监视南朝鲜各政党、社会团体及各界民主人士的行动，阻止南北代表协商会议的召开。伪陆军总参谋长蔡秉德公然宣称：“祖国战线所提倡的和平统一是绝不能容许的”。伪国务总理兼国防长官申性模叫嚣说：鉴于目前的所谓“紧急情势”，李承晚政府“正在考虑发布国家总动员令”。臭名昭著的美国战争贩子杜勒斯十七日赶到南朝鲜，“视察”了美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚积极挑拨内战的三八线，指使李承晚发动内战，以破坏祖国战线所提出的和平统一方案的实现。
    由于李承晚卖国集团的极力阻挠，原定于六月十五日至十七日召开的南北代表协商会议遭到破坏，祖国战线为将告全国人民书传达给南朝鲜各民主政党、社会团体及各界民主人士而派赴汉城的三个代表，竟遭李承晚逮捕，至今下落不明。
    为此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会接受了祖国战线中央委员会的请求，于十九日通过决定，要求南朝鲜的“国会”逮捕破坏国家和平统一的罪魁李承晚、金性洙等民族叛徒，并就南北朝鲜和平统一问题与最高人民会议常任委员会进行谈判。但南朝鲜“国会”迄无答复，而南朝鲜的伪军，却在二十五日拂晓向三八线以北地区，发动了全线进犯。
    伟大的苏军结束了日本帝国主义对朝鲜的半世纪的殖民地统治，给朝鲜人民带来了祖国独立、统一、民主、富强的希望，但是，美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚却分裂朝鲜，破坏这一希望。南朝鲜在美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚集团的血腥统治下，民族经济陷于破产，人民过着饥饿与恐怖的日子。而北朝鲜在朝鲜劳动党及朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军的领导下，经过各项民主改革，业已完成了两个一年经济计划，即将完成一个两年经济计划，并将开始另一个三年经济计划，人民的物质文化生活日益提高。在南北的鲜明对比下，朝鲜人民已充分地认识到谁是他们的敌人和谁是他们的救星。特别是祖国战线成立后的一年来，团结在祖国战线旗帜下的南北朝鲜民主力量已更加强大，而李承晚匪帮卖国集团则更加孤立。正如祖国战线的声明所指出的一样：不论李承晚匪帮在其美国主子的指使下如何疯狂地挣扎，其挑拨内战破坏国家和平统一的企图绝不会得逞。李承晚匪帮的末日，已经不远了。
