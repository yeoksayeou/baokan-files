　　The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been forced to counterattack due to the large-scale military offensive launched by the puppet army of Syngman Rhee. A full-scale civil war has erupted in Korea.
　　The Syngman Rhee clique, the puppet of the United States, has always feared the peaceful reunification of Korea and has recklessly created division and civil war. They have exhausted all barbaric means, persecuting, arresting, slaughtering, and suppressing Korean patriots, and have tried their utmost to obstruct and undermine the realization of the proposals of the Fatherland Front to promote peaceful reunification. As early as 1948, the North Korean side convened a North-South Korean Unity Conference with representatives from all parties in both North and South Korea, but the reactionary puppet government of South Korea refused to accept the conference's proposal for peaceful reunification. In June 1949 and January 1950, the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front twice put forward plans for the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland, but both were rejected by the puppets in South Korea. On the 7th of this month, the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front once again appealed for peaceful reunification, suggesting convening a North-South consultative conference and sending three representatives to Seoul for negotiations. However, the Syngman Rhee group not only refused the suggestion of peaceful reunification but even arrested the peace representatives. Now, the Syngman Rhee group has launched a large-scale military offensive, attempting to completely destroy all the efforts made by the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland and force the Korean people to accept a domestic war.
　　War was long prepared for by the Syngman Rhee group. On August 24, 1948, after Syngman Rhee signed a secret military agreement with the American imperialists in Washington, he put forward the slogan of "Northern Expedition First." On October 31, 1949, when Syngman Rhee addressed the officers and soldiers of the US Navy's Seventh Mixed Fleet on an American warship in Incheon, he frantically shouted "Unify the North and South through war," saying that he "will engage in all the wars that are needed," but must "rely on American assistance." Recently, on the 8th of this month, Shin Sung-mo, the Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang government, fabricated a so-called "emergency situation" to explain the necessity of "increasing American military assistance" and "importing large quantities of weapons," and declared that he was "considering issuing a national mobilization order." Now, the Syngman Rhee group has launched the war without even finding an excuse to publicly issue a general mobilization order.
　　The instigator of this war, American imperialism, needless to say, had been preparing for this war for a long time. After the end of the Second World War, American imperialism was reluctant to withdraw its troops from South Korea. Until the end of June last year, when it could no longer delay due to the pressure of international public opinion, it reluctantly withdrew its troops, but at the same time left behind a huge military advisory group. It not only directly trained the Syngman Rhee puppet army but also controlled the power of supervision and command over the puppet "National Defense Forces" and the police. The task of this US military advisory group was clearly to create conditions for launching a civil war to attack the Korean people, so as to turn Korea into a US military base and colony. On October 26, 1949, Roberts, the head of the US military advisory group in South Korea, declared triumphantly when he met with an Associated Press reporter in Tokyo that "the 100,000 South Korean troops are capable of fighting." On January 26 this year, the United States and Syngman Rhee signed a "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," incorporating South Korea into the US strategic defense line. On May 19 this year, Johnson, the director of the Korean office of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, testified to the US House Appropriations Committee even more bluntly: "The 100,000 South Korean troops trained by the US military mission with American-style military equipment are ready." On June 19, US Secretary of State's Special Advisor Dulles delivered a speech to the South Korean puppet "National Assembly," openly advocating that the United States "is willing to provide spiritual and material support to South Korea in its struggle against communism." These are all ironclad evidence that American imperialism is actively supporting the Syngman Rhee group in instigating the Korean civil war.
　　The Chinese people are particularly easy to understand the current situation of the Korean people. Syngman Rhee - this is almost the Chiang Kai-shek of Korea. The United States is using the method of assisting Chiang Kai-shek to assist Syngman Rhee, and using the method of opposing the Chinese people to oppose the Korean people. Just as Chiang Kai-shek's civil war against the Chinese people was a "civil war" with the Americans providing money and guns and Chiang Kai-shek providing the manpower, Syngman Rhee's civil war against the Korean people is also a "civil war" with the Americans providing money and guns and Syngman Rhee providing the manpower. But Syngman Rhee is just a "minor wizard" compared to Chiang Kai-shek. He is as reactionary as Chiang Kai-shek, but he does not have Chiang Kai-shek's decades of military and political experience and once-prominent "strength." From the beginning, he was completely isolated among the people, so much so that Quirino's Baguio Conference in May did not allow him to participate, just as it did not allow the already defeated Chiang Kai-shek to participate (of course, this also shows that the United States and its accomplices have long recognized that Syngman Rhee was going to launch a civil war, so the Baguio Conference, which "did not discuss military affairs," did not want Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek). Justice is entirely on the side of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; the Korean people are completely on the side of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Therefore, it can be predicted that no matter how much support Syngman Rhee gets from the United States, he will inevitably fail, and the independence, freedom, and unification longed for by the entire Korean people will inevitably be victorious.

### 朝鲜人民为击退进犯者而奋斗

　　朝鲜人民为击退进犯者而奋斗
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，已因遭受了李承晚伪军的大规模军事进攻而被迫反击。朝鲜的全面内战爆发了。
    美国傀儡李承晚集团从来就害怕朝鲜的和平统一，而不顾一切地制造分裂和内战。他们用尽了一切野蛮的手段，迫害、逮捕、屠杀、镇压朝鲜的爱国者，极力阻挠与破坏祖国战线促进和平统一的建议的实现。远在一九四八年，北朝鲜方面就召集了有南北朝鲜各方代表人物参加的南北朝鲜统一会议，但是南朝鲜的反动傀儡政府拒绝接受会议的和平统一主张。一九四九年六月和一九五○年一月，朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会两度提出和平统一祖国的方案，都被南朝鲜的傀儡们所拒绝。本月七日，朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线再一次呼吁和平统一，建议召集南北协商会议，并派遣三个代表到汉城接洽，但是李承晚集团不但仍然拒绝和平统一的建议，而且竟把和平代表也逮捕了。现在，李承晚集团又发动了大规模的军事进攻，企图彻底破坏朝鲜人民为祖国和平统一所进行的一切努力，迫使朝鲜人民接受国内战争。
    战争对于李承晚集团是早已准备了的。一九四八年八月二十四日，李承晚在和美帝国主义者在华盛顿签订了秘密军事协定之后，就提出了所谓“北伐第一”的口号。一九四九年十月三十一日，李承晚在仁川港的美国军舰上，对美国海军第七混合舰队官兵演说的时候，疯狂地叫喊“以战争统一南北”，说他“将从事所需要的一切战争”，只是必须“仰赖美国的援助”。在最近，就在本月八日，李承晚匪帮政府的国务总理兼国防部长官申性模，在记者招待会上，捏造了所谓“紧急情势”，来解释“增加美国军事援助”和“输入大量武器”的必要，并且声明正在“考虑发布国家总动员令”。现在，李承晚集团甚至还没有找到公开发布总动员令的借口，就悍然地发动战争了。
    这个战争的主使者美帝国主义，对于这次战争不消说也是早已准备了的。世界第二次大战结束以后，美帝国主义在南朝鲜曾迟迟不肯撤兵。直到去年六月底，由于国际舆论的压力再也不能拖延的时候，虽然勉强撤了兵，同时却留下了庞大的军事顾问团。它不但直接训练着李承晚伪军，而且掌握着对伪“国防军”和警察的监督权和指挥权。这个美军顾问团的任务，显然是在于制造条件，发动进攻朝鲜人民的内战，以便变朝鲜为美国的军事基地和殖民地。一九四九年十月二十六日，美国驻南朝鲜军事顾问团团长罗伯兹，在东京接见美联社记者时，就曾得意忘形地宣称“南朝鲜十万军队有能力作战”。今年一月二十六日，美国和李承晚又签订了“联防互助协定”，把南朝鲜划入美国战略防线以内。今年五月十九日，美国经合总署朝鲜处处长琼逊，向美国众议院拨款委员会作证时更露骨地说：“美国军事使团所训练的美式军事装备的十万南朝鲜军队，已准备就绪。”六月十九日，美国国务卿特别顾问杜勒斯，在南朝鲜傀儡“国会”发表演说，公然鼓吹美国“对于在与共产主义斗争中的南朝鲜，愿给予精神的和物质的支持”。这些都是美帝国主义积极扶植李承晚集团挑动朝鲜内战的铁证。
    对于朝鲜人民今天的处境，中国人民是特别容易了解的。李承晚——这差不多就是朝鲜的蒋介石。美国正在用援助蒋介石的方法援助李承晚，用反对中国人民的方法来反对朝鲜人民。如同蒋介石进攻中国人民的内战是美国人出钱出枪、蒋介石出人出力的“内战”，李承晚进攻朝鲜人民的内战也是美国人出钱出枪、李承晚出人出力的“内战”。但是李承晚比起蒋介石来不过是一个“小巫”。他和蒋介石一样反动，但是他没有蒋介石那样的军事上政治上的几十年经验和煊赫一时的“力量”。他一开始在人民中就是完全孤立的，以至今年五月季里诺召集的碧瑶会议都不让他参加，和不让已经失败了的蒋介石参加一样（自然，这也是表明美国及其党羽早就承认了李承晚是要发动内战的，所以“不谈军事”的碧瑶会议也就不要李承晚和蒋介石）。正义是完全属于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国方面；朝鲜人民是完全站在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国方面。因此，可以预料，李承晚无论怎样得到美国的支持，必然归于失败，而全朝鲜人民所渴望的独立自由和统一，必然得到胜利。
