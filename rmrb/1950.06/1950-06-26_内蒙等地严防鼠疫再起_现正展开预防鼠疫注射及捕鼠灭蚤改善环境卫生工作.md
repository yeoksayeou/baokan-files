　　Inner Mongolia and Other Places Strictly Prevent Plague Recurrence
    Current Plague Prevention Injections, Rat Catching, Flea Elimination, and Environmental Sanitation Improvement Work are Underway

    [This newspaper reports] In order to prevent the recurrence of the plague, the local people's governments in the areas of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Chahar Province, and Rehe Province where the plague has occurred in the past, have strengthened the epidemic prevention organizations, and carried out work such as preventive injections, rat catching, flea elimination, and improvement of environmental sanitation. The People's Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region issued instructions on epidemic prevention work in early April; expanded the four prevention and treatment centers of the Zhelime League Epidemic Prevention Station; added the Xing'an Epidemic Prevention Station and the Zhaowuda League Epidemic Prevention Station, each with two prevention and treatment centers; the original Inner Mongolia Mobile Epidemic Prevention Team also increased its personnel. Since March, Chahar Province has generally held epidemic prevention and health training courses in various places. A total of more than 4,000 village-level health cadres have been trained in the Chabei epidemic area and the three cities of Zhangjiakou and Datong. The Chahar-Mongolia Plague Prevention and Control Institute of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government also formed an epidemic prevention team of nearly 100 people at the end of March, and together with the epidemic prevention teams in Chahar League and Chabei and other places, went to the epidemic areas last year to organize the people to carry out prevention work, and established two prevention and treatment stations in Kangbao and Inner Mongolia Zuyindi. The above-mentioned epidemic prevention stations, institutes, and teams all cooperated with local governments to use civil schools, mass gatherings, rooftop broadcasts, and blackboards to mobilize the people to carry out rat catching, flea prevention, and environmental sanitation improvement. Inner Mongolia plans to catch 11 million rats this year. During the busy spring plowing and dyke repair in April and May, Zhaowuda League has completed more than 23 percent of the total number of rats caught throughout the year, and Zhelime League and Ulanhot have completed about 6 percent each. More than 600,000 rats have been caught in the severe plague area in northern Rehe. Chahar Province also caught more than 20,000 rats in April; most villages in Jiejiafangzi Village and Kangbao District 6, where the epidemic occurred last year, have completed rat-proof ditches that are three feet wide and four feet deep. The masses in various places have also created many rat-catching tools, and at the same time have begun to clear garbage, plaster and seal wall cracks, organize livestock pens, and build well covers. In terms of preventive injections, from mid-April to the end of May, more than half of the population of Ulanhot City and West Keqian Banner in Inner Mongolia have been injected, and Zhaowuda League has injected one-quarter of the entire population. Rehe Province had completed the injection plan for 250,000 people by mid-May. 159,000 people have been injected in various parts of Chahar Province.
