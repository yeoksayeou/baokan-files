    Overseas Chinese and Indonesian People in Various Places of Indonesia
    Celebrate the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between Me and Indonesia
    Grand Gatherings Held in Jakarta and Semarang
    [Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] News continues to arrive here from Indonesia, reporting the enthusiastic celebrations by overseas Chinese and Indonesian people in various parts of Indonesia to mark the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the Indonesian government.
    On May Day, tens of thousands of magnificent five-star red flags of the new China were raised over the city of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. A celebration meeting attended by more than 15,000 people was held in the city with unprecedented enthusiasm. 132 overseas Chinese groups participated in the meeting. Yang Xinrong, a representative of the presidium, pointed out in his speech that most of the overseas Chinese have abandoned those reactionaries and united, which is a victory for loving democracy and loving peace. Yang Xinrong continued: When the Kuomintang was in power in the past, we were "overseas orphans"; now, the era of "overseas orphans" is over. He said: The cooperation between the Chinese and Indonesian people will have a significant impact on world peace, especially the people of Asia. He finally put forward two major goals: to strengthen overseas Chinese organizations and consolidate the deep friendship between the two major ethnic groups of China and Indonesia.
    After speeches by the chairman and representatives from all walks of life, the meeting read out telegrams sent separately to Chairman Mao and Indonesian President Sukarno, expressing a warm welcome to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and hoping for the prompt exchange of envoys. That evening, Jakarta also held a joint party attended by 35,000 people.
    After more than half a month of joint preparation, 72 overseas Chinese and Indonesian groups in Semarang also held a grand celebration meeting on May 14 to celebrate the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia. The venue for the mass meeting was decorated solemnly and beautifully. The meeting was first addressed by the chairman, followed by a congratulatory speech by the Mayor of Semarang. Representatives from Indonesian women's organizations, trade unions, farmers' associations, youth associations, and overseas Chinese groups also delivered speeches one after another, unanimously emphasizing that the two nations of China and Indonesia should cooperate based on mutual respect and work hard to eliminate the remnants of fascism in Asia and the imperialist colonists. Overseas Chinese and Indonesian masses enthusiastically exchanged slogans and congratulations at the meeting. The meeting adopted telegrams to the leaders of the Chinese and Indonesian governments. On the same afternoon, overseas Chinese and Indonesian groups held a large torch parade of more than 40,000 people. The parade was about four kilometers long. More than 200,000 citizens watched the parade, accounting for about half of Semarang's total population.
