　　Tree Planting Model: Shi Yudian
    Dongye Village, 12th District, Lin County, Pingyuan Province, has a model tree planter named Shi Yudian. He is 57 years old this year and received eleven mu of land during the land reform. He herded cattle for landlords from the age of fourteen, and learned the trade of stonemason at seventeen. A neighbor knew how to graft trees, and he diligently learned from this old man. After mastering the skill, he enthusiastically helped others graft trees. As a result, Shi Yudian's name spread among the masses. For more than thirty years, he has been grafting trees or guiding others in planting trees in his own village and neighboring villages without any compensation. His work has expanded to more than ten villages, and it is estimated that he has grafted more than 20,000 trees. Last year, during the tree planting season, he helped the farmers in his village plant more than 300 trees and led the surrounding villages to plant more than 10,000 trees. Since the start of Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects) this year, his family has planted 160 trees, helped villagers plant 3,700 trees, and sowed seven sheng of soft jujube seeds in the nursery, producing 50,000 to 60,000 seedlings. Now, fruit trees are densely planted around Dongye Village, and the villages are connected into a fruit forest area. The income of the masses has increased as a result, and life is getting better day by day. If you mention Comrade Shi Yudian there, everyone will point to the large tracts of trees and tell you: "Shi Yudian helped us plant these; he helped us plant those too..." Shi Yudian's name is thus praised among the broad masses.
    Comrade Shi Yudian never treats his tree grafting skills as a personal treasure, but always teaches them to others. In his own village, he has taught 150 people. He is very familiar with the psychology of the masses and uses careful calculations to promote the importance of forest protection and afforestation, and the benefits of developing agricultural production and planting more cotton. He also leads the masses in planting trees by setting an example. Therefore, Shi Yudian enjoys a high reputation among the masses.
    In January of this year, Shi Yudian was awarded the title of "Labor Model" and "Tree Planting Expert" of the whole province. This month, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central Government held a summary meeting on spring afforestation in North China, and he was the representative selected by Pingyuan Province to participate in this meeting in Beijing.

　　植树模范石玉殿
    平原省林县十二区东冶村出了一个植树模范，名叫石玉殿，今年五十七岁，土地改革时分到十一亩地。他十四岁就给地主放牛，十七岁学会石匠手艺。邻家有个老汉会接树，他很用心地跟这位老汉学，学好了就热心帮助别人接树。因此石玉殿的名字便在群众中传开了。三十多年来，他无代价地给本村及邻村接树或指导别人栽树。他的工作范围已扩展到十多个村，计算起来大约接了两万多棵树。去年栽树季节，他帮助本村农民栽了三百多棵，并且领导附近各村栽了一万多棵。今年惊蛰开始，他家栽了一百六十棵树，帮助村人栽了三千七百棵；并在苗圃里播种软枣七升，出苗五、六万棵。现在东冶村附近果树密布，村与村已接连成一片果林区。群众的收入因此增加了，光景一天比一天好起来。你要是在那里一提起石玉殿同志，谁都会指着大片的树林告诉你：“这儿是石玉殿帮我们栽的；那儿也是他帮我们栽的……。”石玉殿的名字，就这样在广大的群众中被传颂着。
    石玉殿同志从来不把接树技术当作个人私有的宝贝，总是把它教给别人。他在本村就教会了一百五十个人。他最熟悉群众心理，用精打细算的办法，宣传护林、造林的重要性，宣传发展农业生产和多种棉花的好处。并以身作则，领导群众植树。因此，石玉殿在群众中有很高的威信。
    今年一月，石玉殿荣获了全省“劳动模范”、“植树能手”的称号。本月间中央林垦部召开华北春季造林总结会议，他就是平原省选派来北京参加这次会议的代表。
