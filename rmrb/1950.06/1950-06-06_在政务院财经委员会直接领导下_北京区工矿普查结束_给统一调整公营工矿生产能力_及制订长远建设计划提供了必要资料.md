Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: The survey of various public, joint public-private, factories, mines, and industrial production cooperatives in the Beijing area has now concluded. This work was carried out with the assistance of the Beijing Area Industrial and Mining Enterprise Survey Working Group, directly under the leadership of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government. The working group consisted of 57 cadres from relevant departments of the Central People's Government and the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the财经 research Office of the Renmin University of China. They were divided into several groups based on the nature of the industry and went directly to the factories to provide assistance. The survey began in late March and lasted for two months. A total of 92 units were surveyed.

This survey not only enabled the central financial leadership organs to grasp the basic situation of various industrial and mining enterprises in terms of production equipment, capacity, and other aspects, providing necessary data for unified adjustment of public industrial and mining production capacity and formulation of longer-term economic construction plans in the future; at the same time, it also enabled the leaders of various industrial and mining enterprises to become familiar with the basic situation of their production departments, discover many shortcomings in production management, and thus provided considerable help for improving production management and implementing the economic accounting system. Before the start of the survey, the Beijing Factory of the State-owned North China Paper Company had worked on quotas for a month, but because of a lack of specific investigation into the performance of various machines, the quota work was not done well. After they worked hard to complete the survey reporting this time, they not only laid the foundation for formulating quotas, but also improved the cost accounting system. In the past, the Beijing Brick Kiln even the accountant didn't know how much labor and fuel it took to produce a batch of bricks. In order to fill out the form, after everyone's collective research, it was discovered that in the past, the coal used for firing bricks was mixed with the coal used for cooking and boiling water, making it difficult to calculate production costs. In the past, the electricity consumption of various factories and mines was not calculated separately according to the items on the survey form. This time, after separating the power equipment, electrical machinery, and lighting electricity for calculation, it was immediately discovered that a lot of electricity was wasted due to substandard wiring.

When the survey work began, many industrial and mining enterprises had ideological concerns about this work. Some believed that the form-filling work was too heavy and feared that it would hinder the completion of their own production tasks. To this end, the survey working group held a mobilization meeting on April 8 to make the heads of various units clearly recognize the importance of the survey work for overall economic construction; at the same time, the survey working groups also went to the factories separately to provide specific assistance. Due to the lack of statistical cadres and technicians, and the incompleteness of various records related to production and construction in the past, various factories and mines encountered many difficulties when filling out the survey forms. To this end, many factories and mines, in addition to the factory director personally leading the organization of the form-filling group, fully researched the survey forms in advance, and adopted the method of relying on the masses to collectively collect materials, successfully completed the complex form-filling work. Many factories and mines relied on the memory of veteran workers to fill in the enterprise history and the purchase year and original value of some machines and equipment; some factories and mines hired experts to assist in solving the difficulties in machine equipment performance and other calculation methods. The newly built glass factory found a construction company to measure the factory area and draw the factory's architectural blueprints; the eleven printing factories also held three meetings under the leadership of the Publishing Administration to discuss and determine a unified classification method for products; the technical section personnel of the Changxindian Railway Factory feared that the original materials were wrong, so they spent more than a week going to the workshop to investigate more than 1,000 machines in detail; the Shijingshan Power Plant also held a special meeting to collectively study and formulate machine valuation and depreciation standards.

A small number of factories and mines, due to the incorrect understanding of the survey work by the responsible personnel and the insufficient inspection of their form-filling work by the higher-level leading organs, had some errors in the form-filling work: for example, some units deliberately filled in the machine capacity smaller because they were afraid that the higher-level would increase the production tasks; or tried to get new machines earlier and filled in the depreciation rate larger; some units filled in the staff as workers, or filled in the original materials into the form without analysis. Fortunately, the above errors were discovered by the personnel of the survey working group and were corrected in time.

### 在政务院财经委员会直接领导下  北京区工矿普查结束  给统一调整公营工矿生产能力  及制订长远建设计划提供了必要资料

　　在政务院财经委员会直接领导下
    北京区工矿普查结束
    给统一调整公营工矿生产能力
    及制订长远建设计划提供了必要资料
    【新华社三日讯】北京区各公营、公私合营厂矿及工业生产合作社的普查工作现已结束。这一工作是在中央人民政府财经委员会直接领导的北京区工矿企业普查工作组的协助下进行的。工作组由中央人民政府和北京市人民政府有关部门、全国总工会及中国人民大学财经研究室等单位的干部五十七人组成，按产业性质划分若干小组，直接下厂进行帮助。普查自三月下旬开始，历时两月。进行普查的单位共九十二处。
    这次普查，不但使中央财经领导机关掌握了各工矿企业有关生产设备、能力等方面的基本情况，给今后统一调整公营工矿生产能力与制订较长远的经济建设计划提供了必要的资料；同时，也使各工矿企业领导人员熟悉了自己生产部门的基本情况，发现许多生产管理上的缺陷，因而对改进生产管理及实施经济核算制有不少帮助。国营华北造纸公司北京厂在普查开始前已作了一个月的定额工作，但因对各机器性能缺乏具体调查，所以没有把定额工作做好；这次他们努力把普查填报工作做好后，不但替制订定额打下了基础，而且改善了成本计算制度。北京机器窑过去连会计也不知道出一次砖要花多少人工和燃料，为了填报，经过大家集体研究后，才发现过去把烧砖和烧饭、烧水的用煤混在一起，使生产成本不好计算。过去各厂矿的耗电量没有按照普查表上的项目分开计算，这次把动力设备、电气机械和照明用电分开计算后，马上发现因电线装置不合标准，浪费了不少电量。
    当普查工作开始进行时，许多工矿企业的人员对这一工作思想上是有顾虑的。有的认为填表工作太繁重，怕妨碍本身生产任务的完成；为此，普查工作组曾于四月八日召开了一次动员大会，使各单位的负责人明确认识了普查工作对于全盘经济建设的重要性；同时普查工作小组也分头下厂，进行具体帮助。由于统计干部和技术人员缺乏，过去有关生产建设的各种记录残缺不全，各厂矿在填报调查表格时曾遭遇到许多困难。为此，许多厂矿除由厂长亲自领导组织填报小组，事先充分研究调查表格，并采取依靠群众集体搜集材料的方法，胜利完成了繁复的填报工作。许多厂矿依靠老工人的记忆，填好了企业沿革简历和某些机器设备的购置年份及原始价值；有些厂矿则聘请专家协助，解决了机器设备性能及其他计算方法上的困难。新建玻璃厂找建筑公司来测量厂房面积及绘出该厂建筑蓝图；十一个印刷厂亦在出版总署领导下，举行了三次会议，商定了统一的生产品分类法；长辛店铁路工厂技术科人员怕原来材料有错误，曾花了一个多星期的时间下工场去把一千多台机器详细调查了一遍；石景山发电厂也举行了专门会议，集体研究订出了机器估价与折旧的标准。
    少数厂矿单位由于负责人员对普查工作抱有不正确认识以及上级领导机关对其填报工作检查不够，曾在填报工作中发生若干错误做法：如有些单位怕上级会增加生产任务，故意把机器能力填小；或企图早点领新机器而把折旧率填大；有些单位则把职员填成工人，或把原有材料不加分析地填入表内。上述错误幸经普查工作组人员发现，始得到及时纠正。
