Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 18th. With the summer flood season approaching, the People's Governments in the areas along the Yangtze River and lakes in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River are leading the people to make full preparations for flood control.

The People's Governments at all levels in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province have successively established flood control command organizations. Many polders have established flood control brigades. Some polders implement a system of division of responsibility by company or platoon, and have formulated flood control covenants. Some polders have also organized patrol teams to specialize in patrolling water conditions. Various counties along the lake have prepared flood control materials, and have piled up "peace soil" (soil prepared for rescuing dikes) in important dike sections. In addition, various counties have universally inspected and repaired dikes. The Xiangyin County Flood Control Headquarters has challenged the counties along the lake to strive for no breaches and no flooding of fields.

The Hubei Provincial People's Government has set up twelve flood reporting stations along the Yangtze River and Han River, and has begun reporting flood conditions since June 1st. While closely monitoring the rising water level, the Provincial People's Government is inspecting and repairing dike sections that do not meet engineering standards. The Qijia Yuan section of the Jingjiang Dike, which protects more than ten counties in the Jianghan Plain, was found to have cracks and subsidence in the dike slope during inspection, and is currently being repaired. The work of equipping flood control materials and tools in the areas along the river and lakes in the province will be completed soon.

The Jiangxi Provincial Flood Control Headquarters has been established. The water levels of the Gan River, Xin River, Fu River, and other rivers in the province rose sharply at the same time around the end of May due to incessant plum rains. Some dikes and embankments, such as the Sidu Embankment in Yugan County, collapsed and caused disasters due to substandard engineering and the blind optimism and lack of vigilance of local cadres after the dikes and embankments were built. Currently, the People's Governments at all levels in the province are taking this as a lesson, and are rapidly repairing dikes and preparing for emergency rescue work.

　　成立防汛机构·准备防汛器材
    湘鄂赣大力准备防汛
    江西部分堤圩因干部盲目乐观溃决成灾
    【新华社汉口十八日电】夏汛将至，位于长江中游的湖南、湖北、江西三省沿江沿湖地区人民政府，正领导人民全力进行防汛准备工作。
    湖南省沿洞庭湖地区各地人民政府已相继成立防汛指挥机构。许多垸子都成立了防汛大队，有的垸子以中队或小队为单位，实行分段负责制，订定了防汛公约。某些垸子并组织有巡查组，专司巡查水情。沿湖各县已准备了防汛器材，并在各险要堤段堆置太平土（准备抢救堤防时用的土）。此外，各县还普遍检查和修补了堤防。湘阴县防汛指挥部已向沿湖各县提出挑战，争取不决口、不淹田。
    湖北省人民政府已在长江、汉水沿岸设立十二个报汛站，并已从六月一日起开始报汛。该省人民政府一面密切注意水位上涨情形，一面检查、修补不合工程标准的堤段。保护江汉平原十余县份的荆江大堤祁家渊段，经检查发现堤坡坐裂下移，刻正在加紧修补中。该省沿江沿湖地区，防汛材料和工具的配备工作最近即将完成。
    江西省防汛指挥部已成立。该省赣江、信河、抚河等河流水位，在五月底前后，曾因梅雨不止同时暴涨。余干县四都圩等部分堤圩因工程不合标准，加以当地干部，在修成堤圩后盲目乐观，疏于防范，以致溃决成灾。现该省各地人民政府正以此为教训，迅速补修堤圩及进行抢险的准备工作。
