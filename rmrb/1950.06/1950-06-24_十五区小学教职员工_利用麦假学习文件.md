　　Fifteen District Elementary School Faculty and Staff
    Utilize Wheat Harvest Vacation to Study Documents
    [Reported by our newspaper] With the exception of Fengtai Town Elementary School and Tonghezhuang Elementary School, all other schools in the Fifteenth District of the Beijing suburbs began a ten-day wheat harvest vacation on June 15th. All faculty and staff members, based on the principle of voluntarism, formed study groups by school district. The study materials are the two documents "To Whom Does the Honor Belong?" and "Criticism and Self-Criticism." The study time is set from 7:30 AM to 11:30 AM and from 2:30 PM to 6:00 PM every day. The study method is to first study independently, raise questions, and then discuss collectively. According to the discussion on the 16th, the speeches were generally enthusiastic, and everyone was able to relate them to their own thoughts. The teachers all know that if they do not study, they will not be able to keep up with the development of the times, and they will not be able to teach students well. One history teacher said: "Because my political study is not enough, I often criticize historical figures incorrectly." Generally, teachers also attach importance to political study.

　　十五区小学教职员工
    利用麦假学习文件
    【本报讯】京郊十五区除丰台镇小学和同合庄小学两校外，其他各校均由六月十五日开始放麦假十天。全体教职员工根据自愿原则，以学区为单位，组成了学习小组。学习材料为“荣誉是属于谁的”和“批评与自我批评”两个文件。学习时间定每天早七时半到十一时半、下午二时半到六时。学习方法是先个人自学，提出问题，然后集体讨论。按十六日讨论情形来说，发言普遍热烈，并都能联系到自己的思想。教员们都知道不学习就赶不上时代的发展，同时也教不好学生。有位历史教员说：“由于我政治学习的不够，往往把历史上的人物批判错了。”一般教员也都重视着政治学习。
