　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to strengthen the adjustment of industry and commerce and properly and effectively improve public-private relations and labor-management relations, the Beijing Municipal Industrial and Commercial Adjustment and Handling Committee was formally established on June 24th under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal People's Government.

　　Since price stabilization and a temporary sluggishness in market sales caused widespread difficulties for industry and commerce, the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee, in accordance with the call of the Central People's Government to adjust industry and commerce and improve public-private and labor-management relations, has guided various competent departments and cooperated with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to vigorously assist private industry and commerce in overcoming difficulties. In addition to focusing on explaining policies to the capitalists to break through their thinking, appropriate considerations were also given in terms of processing, ordering, purchasing, loans, and taxation; and the problems existing in public-private relations and labor-management relations were addressed. Thanks to the implementation of the above-mentioned effective measures and the recent gradual activity in market sales, the business conditions of some private industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing have begun to improve. However, adjusting industry and commerce and improving public-private and labor-management relations is a complex and long-term task, and it is necessary to establish a special agency to handle this work. After consultation with the industrial and commercial circles, the Beijing Municipal People's Government unanimously agreed to establish an Industrial and Commercial Adjustment and Handling Committee under the leadership of the government. The committee consists of 29 members, including responsible persons from government departments in charge and state-owned enterprises, as well as representatives from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Industry and Commerce. To facilitate the handling of daily affairs, the committee elected 13 members to form a standing committee. The committee has five groups: industry, commerce, labor-management mediation, taxation, and finance, and all members participate in the work of each group.

　　Current Work Focus of Each Group

　　At the inaugural meeting of the committee on the 24th, in addition to the preliminary discussion and adoption of the organizational regulations in principle, which were sent to the municipal government for review and promulgation, a work plan and working methods were also preliminarily discussed. At the meeting, Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee (and concurrently Chairman of the Committee), pointed out: 1. Regarding the adjustment of industry and commerce, various aspects of the city have already done a lot of work and achieved many results, but this is only the beginning, and greater efforts should be made to carry out the work in a planned manner in the future. 2. The Industrial and Commercial Adjustment and Handling Committee is a temporary consultative body under the leadership of the government. Once the opinions decided through consultation do not violate the regulations of the higher authorities, all departments should earnestly implement them. 3. The current work focus of each group: Industry Group: (1) Solve the current difficulties in sales for some industries and the problems existing in processing and ordering, and prepare opinions in coordination with the upcoming professional meetings to be convened by the central government. (2) Specifically study how to improve the planning of production in the city, overcome blindness, and strengthen guidance on the direction of industrial operation. Commerce Group: (1) Continue to study and adjust the scope and proportion of operations among various commercial entities, and continue to rationally adjust prices. (2) Study and guide the direction of commercial operation. (3) Organize urban and rural trade and expand the sales of industrial products in the city. Labor-Management Mediation Group: Continue to implement the spirit of labor-management consultation to improve management and overcome difficulties, and correctly solve the existing problems. Taxation Group: Assist the Taxation Bureau in studying and improving tax collection methods, and specifically implement the resolutions of the Central Taxation Conference. Finance Group: Coordinate with the adjustment of industry and commerce, relax loan conditions, and actively handle loans by the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank in conjunction with private banks and financial institutions, so that the working capital of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises can be solved to revitalize the entire market. 4. Working methods should have a focus, find typical examples, deal with problems by distinguishing between urgency and importance, and try to carry out work through the original organizational system, but closely coordinate and unify steps. Finally, Deputy Director Cheng especially encouraged Beijing's industrialists and businessmen to become more active, cooperate with the government, and in accordance with the government's established policies and various regulations, effectively solve the current difficulties existing in industry and commerce, so that the capital's industry and commerce can take a step forward.
