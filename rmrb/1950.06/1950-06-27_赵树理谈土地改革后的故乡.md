　　Zhao Shuli Talks About His Hometown After Land Reform
　　By our special correspondent Li Xin
　　On the afternoon of the 20th of this month, I met writer Comrade Zhao Shuli and talked about the new life in his hometown after the land reform. He told me about what he saw and heard during his two trips back home. The following is a summary of his conversation.
　　Since the land reform, I have been to my hometown (Weichi Village, Qinshui County, Shanxi Province) twice—once in the summer of 1946 and once last spring.
　　The trip in the summer of 1946 was just a stopover on the way to another place, so I didn't stay long and didn't get many impressions. One of the most touching things was the mutual aid in threshing wheat. That year, the wheat harvest was particularly abundant, and the threshing grounds were not enough. If they had threshed in the usual way, it would have taken more than a month. They invented a mutual aid method, and it was completed in a few days. This method involved a group (five or six people, one ox) using two threshing grounds, spreading the wheat twice on each ground. All together, one afternoon was equivalent to threshing four grounds (usually, the same number of people could only thresh one or two grounds). While working, those leading the animals pulled them to thresh here and there, those with pitchforks picked here and there, and those with brooms swept here and there... Wooden pitchforks, wooden shovels, brooms... flew all over the place. From a distance, it looked like a martial arts performance. Even the old men, who usually walked steadily, were laughing and jumping around with the young people. This phenomenon had never happened before the land reform.
　　The trip last spring was in the first month of the lunar calendar. Everyone was idle at this time, and I had nothing to do, so I took a few days to visit every household. After this visit, I felt like it was no longer my hometown. This village is very small, with only fifty-two households and two hundred and twenty-five people (the population used to be a little larger). In the past, I was very familiar with it. I knew which people lived in which house. In the past, including myself, half the village was in debt. No matter how much grain was harvested, some of it had to be sold first to pay off debts, so many households had to borrow grain in the spring. When life was not going well, they couldn't afford to be fancy. If the mat on the kang was broken, they couldn't afford a new one. Instead, they would take apart the broken mat to light a fire and smoke, making it smaller and more frayed. Afraid of being seen as unsightly, they would block the windows to make the room darker. Therefore, in many homes, you couldn't see anyone when you first entered. This time, when I went to these houses, none of them were dark. Not only did they have new mats, but the mats were also covered with wool blankets. The quilts and mattresses were made of coarse cloth, but they were all very new. When asked, every household had a little savings—peanuts, sesame seeds, tobacco leaves. At that time, because the relationship between urban and rural areas had not been worked out, they could not sell what they had saved. However, they were not worried at all. Some could store tobacco leaves for two or three years. The village cooperative had an oil mill to press sesame seeds into oil and put it at home. If the price was not right, they would keep it for themselves to eat.
　　Recently, a letter came from the village saying that the village bought seven mules last year, bringing the total to ten, including the original three. There are also three families building houses. I think they must have sold all the peanuts, sesame seeds, and tobacco leaves they had stored.
　　In short, after the land reform, my hometown is no longer the poor place I used to be very familiar with: people have become younger, dark houses have become brighter, grain harvested does not have to be sold first, they are not worried if they cannot sell what they should sell, and they also know where to spend the money they sell for things.

　　赵树理谈土地改革后的故乡
    本报特约记者  李辛
    本月二十日下午，记者遇见作家赵树理同志，谈起他的故乡土地改革后的新生活。他把两次回家时的见闻告诉了我。本文是他谈话的摘要。
    自土改以后，我到过我的故乡（山西省沁水县尉迟村）两次——一次是一九四六年夏天，一次是去年春天。
    一九四六年夏天那一次，因为是到别的地方去，路过故乡，没有顾上多停，所得的印象不多。其中有一件最动人的事是互助打麦子。那一年麦子特别丰收，打麦场不够用——要按平常时候的打法，要一个多月工夫才能打完，他们发明了个互助法子，不几天就打完了。这法子是一个组（五六个人、一犋牲畜）用两个场子，每个场子摊两次，合起来算，一个响午等于打四场（平常也用那末多的人只能打一场或两场）。在工作的时候，牵牲口的拉着牲口碾了这边碾那边，拿杈子的挑了这边挑那边，拿扫帚的扫了这边扫那边……。木杈、木锨、扫帚……满场飞，远处看见好像演武戏，连平常时候四平八稳走路的老汉们，也跟着青年人嘻嘻哈哈跳来跳去：这种现象是土改以前不曾有过的。
    去年春天那一次，是个阴历正月天。这时候大家也闲，我也没事，我就误了几天工夫挨户拜访了一遍。这次访问后，我觉得好像已经不是我的故乡。这个村子很小，只有五十二户，二百二十五口人（过去的人口比这多一点），在从前我最熟悉，那几个人住在那座房子里我都知道。从前连我自己在内，一村有半村都欠外债，打下粮食来够吃不够吃总得先卖一部分还债，因此有好多户到了春天就得借粮。日子过得不称意了就讲不起排场，炕上的席子破了买不起新的，反拆着破席子点火吸烟，越折越小、越毛，怕人看着不好看，把窗子堵得黑一点，因此有好多人家，当你初进到房子里总看不见人。这一次我到这些房子里去的时候，竟没有一座是黑的了，不只有了新席子，席子上又都铺了羊毛毯，被子褥子虽是粗布的，却都很新鲜，问起来家家还都有点小积蓄——落花生、芝麻、烟叶子。当时因为城乡关系还没弄好，他们积蓄的东西卖不出去，不过他们都毫不着急，有的能把烟叶子存到二三年。村子里合作社有油房，把芝麻打成油放到家里，价钱不合适就留着叫自己吃。
    最近村里来信，说村子里去年一年买了七头骡子，连原来的三头共有十头，还有三家修房子的，我想他们一定是把存的那些花生、芝麻、烟叶子都卖了。
    总之，土改后我的故乡，再不是我从前非常熟悉的那个穷像了：人也变年轻了，黑房子也亮了，打下粮食不用先卖了，该卖的卖不出去也不着急了，卖出了东西也懂得应该把钱用到什么地方了。
