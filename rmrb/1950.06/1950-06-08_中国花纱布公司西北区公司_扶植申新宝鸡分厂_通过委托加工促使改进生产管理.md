　　China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation Northwest District Company
    Supports Shenxin Baoji Branch
    Promotes Improved Production Management Through Commissioned Processing
    [Reported by this newspaper] (Xi'an Mass Daily News) To enable the Shenxin No. 4 Textile Company Baoji Branch, which was heavily in debt, lacked funds, and whose production had stagnated, to continue production, the Northwest District Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation took the initiative in mid-May to sign a commissioned processing contract with the factory. The contract is valid from May 11th to June 13th; the contract stipulates that the company will supply 5,000 piculs of raw cotton, and the factory is responsible for processing, returning 878 pieces of 20-count yarn, 4,210 bolts of 12-pound cloth, and 3,350 bolts of 14-pound cloth; the contract also guarantees the factory appropriate processing profits.
    The factory's current structure is still very large, and there are still unwarranted waste phenomena in the production process, resulting in excessively high costs. To this end, the Northwest Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation learned from the experiences and lessons of the former Northwest Trade Corporation's directly affiliated Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company in supporting the development and production of private cotton textile industry and establishing supply and marketing relationships last year, and paid special attention to strengthening the guidance of private cotton textile industry's production planning, and will gradually guide the factory to conduct labor-management consultation and strictly supervise the implementation of contract provisions. When signing this contract, the factory's employee representative meeting first formulated a daily production plan, and the company allocated raw cotton successively according to the factory's production capacity, and the factory had to hand in the produced cloth every day. This will accelerate capital turnover, ensure the completion of the production plan, and establish the credibility of both parties in implementing the contract provisions. The formulation of the plan will enable the increase of output. Before May 22nd, the daily output of yarn was 25 pieces, and the output of 12-pound and 14-pound cloth was 120 bolts each. From May 22nd, the daily yarn output can be increased by 5 pieces, and the cloth output remains the same. In order to understand the factory's implementation of the production plan, so as to allocate cotton and collect cloth on time, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation sent a special person to be stationed in the factory. In addition, the company and the larger private Dahua Yarn Factory in the Northwest are also negotiating to sign a processing contract based on their actual difficulties.

    扶植申新宝鸡分厂 
    通过委托加工促使改进生产管理
    【本报讯】西安群众日报消息：中国花纱布公司西北区公司，为使积欠外债数十亿、缺乏资金，生产陷于停顿的申新第四纺织公司宝鸡分厂能继续进行生产，特于五月中旬主动与该厂订立委托加工合同。合同有效期限从五月十一日起至六月十三日止；合同规定：由该公司供给原棉五千市担，由工厂负责加工，缴回二十支纱八百七十八件，十二磅布四千二百一十匹及十四磅布三千三百五十匹；合同中并保证了该厂适当的加工利润。
    该厂目前机构仍很庞大，生产过程中依旧存在着不应有的浪费现象，故成本过高。为此，西北花纱布公司吸取了原西北贸易总公司直属花纱布公司去年在扶植私营纺织业发展生产、建立供销关系过程中的经验教训，特别注意加强了私营棉纺业生产计划性的指导，并将逐步指导该厂进行劳资协商，和严格监督执行合同规定。在此次订立合同时，即首先由该厂职工代表会议制定了逐日的生产计划，公司按工厂的生产能力陆续拨发原棉，该厂则须逐日交出生产的布匹。这样便可加速资金流转，保证完成生产计划，而且树立双方执行合同规定的信用。由于计划的制定，将可使产量提高，如在五月二十二日以前，每日产纱二十五件、十二磅及十四磅布各一百二十匹，从二十二日起，纱产每日可增加五件，布产照常。花纱布公司为了了解该厂执行生产计划的情况，以便按时进行拨花、收布，曾派了专人驻厂。又，该公司与西北规模较大的私营大华纱厂，亦正根据其实际困难，洽商订立加工合同中。
