　　Welcome Zhao Guoyou and Other Heroes and Model Workers
    Cultural Palace Holds Evening Party
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council held an evening party at the Laboring People's Cultural Palace at 7:30 PM on the 18th of this month to welcome six heroic model representatives specially invited to attend the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: Zhao Guoyou, Zhao Guilan, Yuan Daohua, Du Xianyang, Pan Changyou, and Gong Jinmei. When the representatives entered the venue, the entire audience applauded warmly. Zhao Guoyou, a youth model worker from the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory who created a new record, and Zhao Guilan, a model worker from the Dalian Jianxin Chemical Factory who sacrificed herself to protect the factory, reported their feelings about attending the CPPCC meeting. Subsequently, Gong Jinmei, a first-class meritorious worker from the Shanghai No. 9 Textile Factory, Yuan Daohua, a factory protection model worker from the Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill during the liberation, Du Xianyang, a model worker in the Northeast Railway production competition, and Pan Changyou, a youth labor model from the Tianjin Steel Plant, introduced their respective exemplary deeds, unanimously pointing out that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government can the working class truly be liberated. The workers also requested Comrade Zhao Guilan to report on the situation of her protecting the factory. Because Comrade Zhao Guilan had not been discharged from the hospital for long, she could not speak much, so Comrade Zhao Guoyou introduced it on her behalf. Zhao Guilan's exemplary deeds of sacrificing herself to protect the factory deeply moved the participants, who continuously applauded warmly to express their respect and love for her.
