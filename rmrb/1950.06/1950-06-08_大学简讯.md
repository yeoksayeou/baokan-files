　　Peking University Geology Department Students Go to Western Liaoning Molybdenum Mine for Internship

　　Fourth-year students from the Geology Department of the Faculty of Science at Peking University, after studying metal mineral deposits, interned for two weeks in the Yangjiazhangzi Molybdenum Mine area in Jinxi County, Western Liaoning Province, from May 6 to 19. Before the internship, they consulted some information about the mining area at the university, and after arriving at the mining area, they listened to the guidance and explanation of responsible comrades from relevant parties. They visited molybdenum and lead-zinc mines, went down a mine shaft once, and visited the Jinxi Cement Plant. After the visit and internship, students gained some understanding of practical issues such as why minerals are formed, how they are formed, what their characteristics are, how to find minerals in nearby areas based on these characteristics, and how to refine them. They also studied the "strata" and "structure" of the nearby area and learned some research methods. Secondly, the students gained a preliminary understanding of how to combine with workers in their work, learn from their experience, and give play to their creativity. Workers told them what kind of stone has minerals, what kind of stone does not, and what kind of stone contains more minerals. These are experiences that workers have gained from many years of work, and it is difficult to learn them from books alone.

    北大地质系学生赴辽西钼矿区实习
    北京大学理学院地质系四年级同学，学习了金属矿藏以后，于五月六日到十九日在东北辽西省锦西县杨家仗子钼矿区实习了两个星期。实习前，他们曾在学校里参考了一些关于该矿区的资料，到达矿区后又听取了有关方面负责同志的指导讲解。他们先后看到的有钼矿和铅锌矿，曾下过一次矿洞，并参观了锦西洋灰厂。参观实习之后，同学们对为什么会生矿、怎样生成的、有什么特征、根据这些特征怎样在附近地区找矿以及如何提炼等实际问题，都有了一些了解，并研究了附近“地层”和“构造”的情况。也学习了一些研究方法。其次，同学们初步体会了在工作中应如何和工人结合起来，吸取他们的经验，发挥他们的创造性。工人们曾经告诉他们什么样的石头有矿，什么样的石头没有，什么样的石头含的矿多等。这些都是工人们从多年的工作里体会出的经验，只在书本上是很难学到的。
