The texts of the two telegrams are as follows:

Mr. Bermeester, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of the German Democratic Republic:

It is extremely gratifying that radio communications between our two countries have been established today! This will undoubtedly play a significant role in the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Germany and in the defense of world peace.

On behalf of all the comrades working in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the People's Republic of China, I extend my respects to you and the postal and telecommunications comrades under your leadership! I also believe that through our cooperation and efforts, we can strengthen the political, economic, and cultural ties between the two countries and further consolidate the friendship and unity of the two peoples.

I pledge that I and my colleagues will do our utmost to accomplish this task.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhu Xuefan, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of the People's Republic of China

(2) Congratulatory telegram from Mr. Bermeester, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of the German Democratic Republic, to Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of China:

Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of the People's Republic of China:

On the occasion of the opening of the Sino-German radio circuit, I, in the name of the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of the German Democratic Republic, extend my respects to you, Minister Zhu Xuefan! I am delighted that this new tool for transmitting messages between China and Germany will strengthen the political, economic, and cultural ties between the two countries!

The German people, who were liberated from the fascist iron heel by the Soviet Union under the leadership of the great Stalin five years ago, have always looked with admiration upon the Chinese people who, under the leadership of the glorious Mao Zedong, are engaged in a heroic struggle and have thus shaken off the shackles of British and American imperialists and reactionaries, and are encouraged by your great victory.

The German people know that by uniting with the Chinese people and standing on the side of the people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union, they can use unyielding efforts to oppose all kinds of aggression in order to defend world peace.

The German people hope that their Chinese friends will have a peaceful and happy future.

Today's opening of the radio circuit between the capitals of China and Germany is a manifestation of the permanent cooperation between the postal and telecommunications services of the two countries.

I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you for the opening of this new undertaking, and I ask you to convey my thanks to your working comrades.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Bermeester, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of the German Democratic Republic

　　中德间开放无线电通信
    两国邮电部部长互电致贺
    【新华社十三日讯】中华人民共和国首都北京与德意志民主共和国首都柏林之间的无线电通信，已自十三日起正式开放。我中央人民政府邮电部部长朱学范与德国邮电部部长柏米司特，互致贺电。两电电文如下：
    （一）中华人民共和国邮电部部长朱学范致德意志民主共和国邮电部部长柏米司特的贺电：德意志民主共和国邮电部部长柏米司特先生：
    贵我两国间的无线电通信，从今天起开始建立了起来，至堪庆贺！这对于中德两国人民的友好合作和世界和平的保卫，无疑地会有重大的作用。
    我谨代表中华人民共和国邮电部全体工作同志，向你和你所领导的邮电工作同志们致敬！并相信经由我们的合作与努力，必可加强两国间政治、经济与文化的联系，而使两国人民的友谊团结，更加巩固起来。
    我愿保证我和我的工作同志们，将以最大的努力，完成这一任务。
                 中华人民共和国邮电部部长  朱学范
    （二）德意志民主共和国邮电部部长柏米司特致我国邮电部部长朱学范的贺电：中华人民共和国邮电部部长朱学范先生：

    五年前被在伟大的斯大林领导下的苏联从法西斯铁蹄之下所解放出来的德国人民，对于在光荣的毛泽东领导之下从事英勇斗争，因而摆脱了英、美帝国主义者和反动派的桎梏的中国人民，始终寄以钦羡的目光，并为你们的伟大胜利而鼓舞。
    德国人民知道和中国人民结合一体，站在以苏联为首的人民民主国家一边，用不屈的努力，去反对各种侵略，以保卫世界和平。
    德国人民希望他们的中国友人，有一个和平、康乐的将来。
    今天中德两国首都开放无线电路，是两国邮电事业永久合作的表现。
    我以为对于这个新的事业的开放，应该向你表示衷心的谢意，并请你将我的谢意传达给你的工作同志们。
                           德意志民主共和国邮电部部长柏米司特
