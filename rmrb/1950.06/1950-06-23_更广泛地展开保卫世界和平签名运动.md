　　More Widely Expand the Signature Campaign to Defend World Peace
    Yu Gan
    The meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace held in Stockholm from March 15 to 19 issued a declaration banning atomic weapons, calling on all kind people in the world to sign this declaration. On April 28, the China Peace Committee issued a notice calling on the people of the whole country to enthusiastically respond to this call from the World Peace Congress Standing Committee and launch the broadest possible signature campaign demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, starting from May 1st. The Chinese people, who have already won victory and have always loved peace, have shown their high degree of political awareness and enthusiastically launched this signature campaign.

    According to recent incomplete statistics, the number of signatures nationwide has reached more than 11.2 million, of which the number of signatures in Beijing and Tianjin accounts for half of the city's population, and more than 90% of organized citizens have signed. More than 3.56 million people in the entire Northeast have signed, accounting for one-tenth of the total population. At present, the signature campaign, in addition to continuing in densely populated cities, has gradually penetrated into the vast rural areas. In the rural areas where social reforms have been implemented, the emancipated peasants have enthusiastically signed their names. They said: The more signatures, the more solid the fruits of emancipation. According to the statistics of Sishui County, Shandong Province alone, as of the end of May, 100,400 farmers had signed the peace declaration.

    The Chinese people's struggle for democracy and peace has a history of more than 100 years. This struggle has only been won today. Therefore, the Chinese people cherish and value the hard-won democracy and peace extremely. They eagerly hope to engage in restoration and construction work in a peaceful and stable environment so as to make their country prosperous and happy. This is their greatest interest. However, at present, American imperialists and their servants are frantically preparing for a new war of aggression, seriously threatening world peace. In China, American imperialism is stepping up its assistance to the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan in their dying struggle, and supporting the bandit gang's bombing, blockade, and sabotage activities against the Chinese mainland. These facts have taught the Chinese people that in order to obtain true and lasting peace, they must thoroughly combat the aggressive group headed by American imperialism in various ways and from all aspects. On the one hand, the Chinese people should continue to support the People's Liberation Army with all their strength and fight for the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet, so as to finally end the American imperialists' aggression against China. Because the liberation of the whole of China is the greatest contribution to the cause of ensuring peace in the Far East and even world peace. On the other hand, on a global scale, the Chinese people should enthusiastically participate in all struggles aimed at defending world peace, and today they should further expand the peace signature campaign, because this signature campaign is an important part of the struggle to defend world peace.

    The Chinese peace signature campaign has only been launched for a short two months, but it has already achieved considerable success. However, it should also be pointed out that due to insufficient further propaganda and education work, some people still have some vague ideas about the significance of the signature campaign. For example, the idea of opposing all wars, the fear of atomic weapons, and the doubt about the role of the signature campaign, etc. In order to improve and consolidate existing understanding, and in order to further expand the signature campaign, these ideas must be clarified. Therefore, strengthening propaganda and education should become a very important task in the future. To this end, the China Peace Committee has organized world peace propaganda groups to carry out propaganda work in seven cities including Nanjing and Shanghai. In Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and other places that the group has visited, the peace signature campaign has been further developed. The number of signatures in Shanghai is increasing rapidly, and it is expected to reach more than a quarter of the city's population by the end of June.

    At the same time, in the future, the signature campaign must be further deepened into the vast number of farmers and unorganized urban residents, so as to push the signature campaign to a higher stage. This requires more meticulous organization and more in-depth propaganda and education work. Peace congresses and sub-congresses across the country, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all newspapers and magazines must work with redoubled efforts to complete this unprecedented organizational and educational work, so that the peace declaration can be spread to every corner of China.

    Let us strive to have one-tenth or even one-fifth of the national population participate in the peace signature campaign, let us strive to further deepen the peace signature campaign, and let us use this practical action to respond to the call of the London meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress and to welcome the upcoming Second World Congress of Supporters of Peace in October.

　　更广泛地展开保卫世界和平签名运动
    于干
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会三月十五日至十九日在斯德哥尔摩举行的会议，发出了禁用原子武器的宣言，号召全世界一切善良的人们在这一宣言上签名。四月二十八日，中国保卫世界和平大会委员会发出了通知，号召全国人民热烈地响应世界和大常委会的这一号召，从“五一”起展开最广泛的要求禁止原子武器的签名运动。已经获得胜利并一向爱好和平的中国人民，表现了自己高度的政治觉悟，热烈地展开了这一签名运动。
    据最近不完全的统计，全国签名人数已达一千一百二十余万人，其中北京与天津签名人数已占全市人口的半数，有组织的市民，百分之九十以上都签了名。全东北已有三百五十六万多人签了名，占全部人口的十分之一。目前签名运动除继续在人口集中的城市内进行外，并已逐渐深入到广大的农村中去。在已经实行了社会改革的农村中，翻身的农民们都踊跃地签了名。他们说：签的名字愈多，翻身果实愈牢靠。仅山东省泗水县一个县的统计，截至五月底止，已有十万零四千农民在和平宣言上签了名。
    中国人民为争取民主和平而进行的斗争，已经有一百多年的历史了。这一斗争，直到今天才获得胜利。因此，中国人民对于得来不易的民主和平极为爱护和尊贵。他们热望在和平安定的环境中从事恢复和建设工作，以使自己的国家臻于富强康乐。这是他们最大的利益。但是，目前美国帝国主义者及其仆从们，正在疯狂地进行新侵略战争的准备，严重地威胁着世界的和平。在中国，美帝国主义正在加紧援助台湾国民党残余匪帮进行垂死的挣扎，并支持匪帮对中国大陆的轰炸、封锁和特务破坏。这些事实教训了中国人民，为了获得真正而持久的和平，必须以各种方法，从各个方面去彻底地打击以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团。中国人民一方面应该继续以全力支援人民解放军，为解放台湾和西藏而战，以最后结束美帝国主义者对中国的侵略。因为全中国的解放，乃是对保障远东和平乃至世界和平事业的最伟大贡献。另一方面，在世界范围内，中国人民应该热烈地参加一切旨在保卫世界和平的斗争，今天则应更进一步地展开和平签名运动，因为这一签名运动正是为保卫世界和平而斗争的重要的一部分。
    中国的和平签名运动自开展以来，还只短短两个月，却已经得到了相当的成就。但是也应该指出的是：由于进一步的宣传教育工作还作得不够，因此至今还有一部分人对签名运动的意义，存在着一些模糊的思想。例如反对一切战争的思想，害怕原子武器的思想，以及怀疑签名运动的作用等等。为了提高和巩固已有的认识，也为了更进一步地开展签名运动，这些思想是必须加以廓清的。因此，加强宣传教育，应成为此后极为重要的一项工作。中国保卫世界和平大会委员会为此已组织了世界和平宣传团，前往南京、上海等七座城市进行宣传工作。在该团已到过的南京、上海、杭州、广州等地，和平签名运动已获得了进一步的发展。上海的签名人数正在迅速增加着，预计在六月底可达到全市人口的四分之一以上。
    同时，今后必须把签名运动更深入到农民和城市的尚未组织起来的广大市民中去，以便把签名运动推向更高的阶段。这就需要更缜密的组织和更深入的宣传教育工作。全国各地和大分会、各民主党派、各人民团体、各报纸杂志，必须以加倍的努力，去完成这一规模空前的组织和教育工作，使和平宣言传布到中国的每一个角落去。
    为争取全国人口十分之一、甚至五分之一参加和平签名运动而努力吧，为把和平签名运动更深入地展开而奋斗吧，让我们用这一实际行动来响应世界和大常委会执行局伦敦会议的号召，来迎接即将于十月召开的第二届世界拥护和平大会。
