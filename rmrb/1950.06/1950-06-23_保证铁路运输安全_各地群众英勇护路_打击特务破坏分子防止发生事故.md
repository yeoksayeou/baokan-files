　　打击特务破坏分子防止发生事故
　　[本报讯] To ensure the safety of railway transportation, mass railway protection campaigns are actively being carried out across the country. In the Northeast, 105 railway protection committees, 478 railway protection sub-committees and protection zones (including 2,006 large and small villages and towns), 243 railway protection squads, and 5,541 railway protection teams have been organized. In addition, schools have organized a total of 1,523 railway protection brigades, detachments, and teams. According to statistics from the Harbin and Jilin Public Security Bureaus alone, more than 977,000 people have been organized. Railway bureaus in Tianjin, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Jinan, and Shanghai have also established railway protection committees and organized railway protection villages. Using Party and League members as the backbone and militia as the vanguard, they implement joint defense, organize patrols, assign cadres to lead, formulate railway protection covenants and disciplines, and carry out segmented responsible guarding to reduce the gaps for bandits and special agents to sabotage. In order to exchange railway protection experiences and encourage mass enthusiasm for railway protection, various places have paid attention to timely commendations of models. For example, after the railway protection militia of Dawangtun Village in Qi County, Pingyuan Province, captured a special agent who attempted to burn a bridge, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Public Security Department immediately wrote a letter and sent someone to personally award them a flag. When Wang Changyan, the militia captain of Nanjia Village in Yixian County, Shanxi Province, and farmers Dong Yinqi and others discovered railway damage, they immediately notified the station, thereby preventing a train derailment accident. For this, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau awarded the village 300 catties of millet and a silk banner. The public security departments of the Northeast Railway Public Security Bureau have adopted a circular merit competition method, issuing railway protection plaques, evaluating them monthly. If a village, a school, or a team continuously displays the railway protection merit plaque for three months, the Railway Bureau Public Security Department will award them a prize flag. Due to relying on the masses and organizing them to carry out railway and line protection work, the sabotage activities of special agents have been severely打击. For example, in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, a total of 19 cases of line damage occurred in April, and 12 saboteurs were captured. Since the establishment of the railway protection committee in Sandaotai Village, Chaigoubao District, Wanquan County, in September last year, no accidents have occurred for half a year. The county has been rated as a model railway protection village by the People's Congress.
　　With the improvement of the masses' awareness, in addition to actively taking responsibility for protecting railway safety, they also voluntarily participate in road maintenance and other civil engineering labor, and enthusiastically contribute various railway materials. According to statistics from the Northeast last year, 26,289 people participated in road maintenance, snow removal, weeding, and station building labor, and contributed 38,253 pieces of various materials, with a total value of 5,069,555,000 yuan (Northeast currency). In the Suibao area of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, near Chasuqi and Zhuozi Mountain, after railway workers and public security personnel went deep into the villages twice to conduct publicity and mobilization, the masses contributed various road materials with a total value of approximately 26,000 catties of millet.
　　The achievement of the above results is mainly due to the railway public security departments taking the initiative to closely contact local authorities and carrying out mass work by helping the masses with production and labor. At the same time, the leading cadres of local Party and government organs also personally conducted in-depth publicity, organized and promoted mass railway protection work. In particular, after the State Council issued instructions to strengthen railway protection work, it has aroused greater attention from leaders at all levels to railway protection work. At present, all localities are actively carrying out universal publicity and education, further mobilizing the masses, focusing on organizing militia joint defense teams, purifying railway protection organizations, and solving some practical difficulties in mass railway protection, so as to consolidate and improve mass railway protection work.

    打击特务破坏分子防止发生事故
    【本报讯】为保证铁路运输安全，全国各地积极开展群众护路运动。东北已组织起护路委员会一百○五个，护路分会与护路区四百七十八个（包括大小村镇二千零六个），护路中队二百四十三个，护路小组五千五百四十一个。此外，学校组织的护路大队、中队、小队共一千五百二十三个。仅哈尔滨与吉林两个公安处的统计，已组织起群众九十七万七千多人。天津、太原、郑州、济南、上海各路局也纷纷建立了护路委员会，组织起护路村庄。各地以党、团员为骨干，以基干民兵带头的方法，实行联防，组织巡逻，指定干部领导，制订护路公约与纪律，进行分段负责看护，以减少土匪特务的破坏空隙。为交流护路经验，鼓舞群众护路情绪，各地均注意了及时表奖模范。如平原省淇县大王屯护路民兵，捉住企图烧桥的一个特务后，郑州路局公安处立即写信、派人亲自送旗去奖励。山西省解县一区南贾村民兵队长王长彦、农民董荫起等发现铁路被破坏时，立即通知车站，因而防止了一次列车出轨事故。为此太原路局奖给该村小米三百斤、锦旗一面。东北铁路公安局各公安处、以循环优胜竞赛办法，发给护路牌，一月一评，一个村、一个学校或一个小组，如连挂三个月的护路优胜牌，即由路局公安处发给奖旗。由于依靠群众和组织群众进行护路护线工作，严重的打击了特务分子的破坏活动。如天津路局管辖地区内，四月份共发生破坏线路案十九起，捉获破坏分子十二名。万全县柴沟堡区三道台村，自去年九月区护路委员会成立后，半年没有出过任何事故，该县被人民代表会评为护路模范村。
    随着群众觉悟程度的提高，除积极负责保护铁路的安全外，并自动参加养路以及其他工务建筑劳动，踊跃献出各种铁路器材。据东北去年一年的统计，有二万六千二百八十九人参加了养路，扫雪、拔草以及建筑站舍等劳动，并献出各种器材三万八千二百五十三件，总价值五十亿六千九百五十五万五千元（东北币）。天津路局绥包一个地区、察素齐、卓资山一带，经过铁路职工与公安人员两次深入乡村，宣传动员，群众即献出总值约二万六千多斤小米的各种路料器材。
    以上成绩的获得，主要是由于铁路公安部门主动与地方机关密切联系，并从帮助群众生产劳动中，开展群众工作。同时，地方党、政机关领导干部，亦亲自深入宣传，组织与推动群众护路工作，特别是政务院颁布加强护路工作指示后，更加引起各级领导干部对护路工作的重视。现各地正在积极进行普遍的宣传教育，进一步发动群众，重点组织民兵联防队，纯洁护路组织并解决群众护路中的某些实际困难，巩固与提高群众护路工作。
