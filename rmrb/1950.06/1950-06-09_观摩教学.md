　　Observing Teaching
    Huabei Middle School
    [This newspaper dispatch] In order to exchange teaching experience and improve teaching methods, teachers at Huabei Middle School have frequently held observation teaching sessions this semester, which has improved the teaching work. The school held "Demonstration Teaching" and "Mutual Class Observation" sessions last semester. At the beginning of this semester, teachers of Chinese language and history continued to use this method to improve their professional skills. There are three ways to observe: (1) When a teacher is teaching, other teachers who are free can observe at will. (2) Individual teachers arrange observation times and study each other. (3) The teaching affairs office designates teachers with more teaching experience to fully prepare the teaching content and methods in advance, and then sets a date to notify teachers with free periods to attend the lecture for a teaching demonstration.
    Whether it is collective observation or individual observation, after listening to a class, the teacher giving the class and the teacher listening to the class must sit down together for discussions and research, absorbing advantages and criticizing shortcomings. A Chinese language teacher, after listening to a class by another Chinese language teacher, offered this opinion: "In lecturing, being able to grasp a key point in the text and explain it in depth in combination with the students' ideological problems is a good method. However, if the questions raised are not appropriate, it will make people feel that the questions are asked too suddenly. If the students' emotions cannot be grasped, and the teacher lectures while the students play, it will not achieve a good effect."
    Through observation teaching, teachers have gained many improvements in teaching methods. For example, a history teacher was unpopular with students last semester. Students thought his teaching method was rigid, his voice was monotonous, and the arrangement of materials was not very appropriate. After observation teaching, he absorbed the strengths of others and has now won the praise of the students.

    Fifth District Night School
    [This newspaper dispatch] Most of the voluntary teachers in the night schools in the Fifth District are more active intellectuals, but they generally lack experience in adult education. They often use the method of teaching children to educate adults, and the explanations often deviate from reality, so the students are not interested, and the teaching effect is not great. In order to improve the teaching methods of night school teachers, the Cultural and Educational Section of the People's Government of the district specially held mutual observation teaching sessions for night school teachers from the beginning of May, lasting two weeks, which ended on the 20th of last month. The teachers gained several preliminary teaching experiences in observation and research: (1) Teachers should understand the characteristics and learning requirements of adult students, and in teaching, they should grasp the characteristics of adult students having rich life experience, strong comprehension ability, and weak memory, and inspire them to actively study on their own and help each other learn. (2) Unlike teaching children, one should not only focus on "recognizing" and "reading," but should pay attention to teaching adult students to "write" and "use" more. (3) Strengthen the teachers' theoretical and policy study, and overcome the errors that occur in teaching due to low political level.

　　观摩教学
    华北中学
    【本报讯】为了交流教学经验，改进教学方法，华北中学教师在本学期经常举行观摩教学，使教学工作提高了一步。该校上学期即曾举办过《示范教学》和《互相听课》。本学期开始，国文和历史两科教师，继续运用这种方法改进业务。观摩方式有三种：（一）某教师教课时，其他没课的教师可随意去观摩。（二）个别的约定观摩时间，互相研究。（三）教导处指定教学经验较丰富的教师，事先充分准备教学内容和教学方法，然后规定日期，通知有空堂的教师听讲，举行教学示范。
    无论是集体观摩或个别观摩，在听完一堂课后，教课者与听课者必在一起座谈研讨，吸取优点，批评缺点。某国文教员听完另一位国文教员一堂讲，就提出了这样的意见：“在讲课时，能抓住课文中的某一要点，结合学生的思想问题，深入解释，这种方法是好的。但提出来的问题，如不能恰到好处，会使人感觉问题提的太突然。如不能掌握学生的情绪，教师讲自己的，学生玩自己的，就不会收到很好的效果。”
    通过观摩教学，教师们在教学方法上已获得不少改进。如某历史教员，上学期不受学生欢迎。学生认为他的教法呆板，话音单调，材料安排也不大适当。经过观摩教学，他吸取了别人的长处，如今已获得了学生们的称赞。

    五区夜校
    【本报讯】第五区的夜校义务教员，大部分是较积极的知识分子，一般都缺乏成人教育的经验。他们常用教儿童的方式教育成人，讲解常常脱离实际，学生不感兴趣，教学效果不大。该区人民政府文教科，为改进夜校教员的教学方法，特于五月初旬起，举办夜校教员互相观摩教学，历时两周，已于上月二十日结束。教员们在观摩研究中，获得几点初步教学经验：（一）教员对成人学生的特点及学习要求应有了解，在教学时，要掌握成人学生生活经验丰富、理解力强、记忆力弱等特点，启发他们积极自学及互助学习。（二）不能像教儿童那样，单着重“认”和“读”，应注意教成人学生多“写”多“用”。（三）加强教员们理论、政策学习，克服因政治水平低，在教学时发生的错误。
