Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd—The full text of the speech given by uprising General Liu Wenhui at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 21st is as follows:

　　Chairman, fellow committee members, esteemed colleagues:

　　I am deeply honored and also greatly humbled to be specially invited to attend this Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In the past few days, I have been deeply moved and wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Mao's opening address, Vice Chairman Liu's report on the land reform issue, Premier Zhou's political report, and the reports on various tasks from other leaders. Now, I would like to briefly express some of my thoughts: First, I must speak about myself. I am truly ashamed to be here at this meeting today!

　　Since graduating from the Baoding Military Academy in 1914 and serving the country, I have always wanted to do something to save the people from suffering, to make China prosperous and strong, and to enable it to stand tall in the world. Therefore, when I was leading troops, I wanted to expand my military strength, unify Sichuan and Xikang, and unify the Southwest, in order to partially realize my grand ambition. Little did I know that this kind of individualistic and heroic thinking, detached from the masses, could only develop into feudal separatism and warlord power struggles, without bringing any happiness to the people. On the contrary, it harmed the people without me even realizing it. Thinking about it now, this is something for which I should be twelve thousand times contrite.

　　As everyone knows, I have always been anti-Chiang. Although there were times when I made concessions and compromises, it was entirely for the sake of "preserving strength and maintaining territory." However, I have always been anti-Chiang in my heart, and you can all believe that. But "anti-Chiang" is not the same as "revolution." In fact, many of my past thoughts and actions, as they appear today, were very serious mistakes and violated the interests of the revolution and the people.

　　Due to my anti-Chiang stance, as everyone knows, for more than a decade, starting from the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I have maintained close relationships or organizations with revolutionary forces, including the Chinese Communist Party, the China Democratic League, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and other democratic parties, groups, and individuals. These friends have successively provided me with guidance and assistance, enabling me to cope with certain events with relative ease. Last year, as Chiang Kai-shek was retreating step by step towards the Southwest, vainly hoping to use the Southwest as a base to prolong the war, I secretly worked with Generals Deng Xihou and Pan Wenhua, as well as responsible comrades from the China Democratic League, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the Chinese Communist Party, to mobilize the Sichuan and Xikang armies and people from all walks of life to unite and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the Chiang, Hu, and Wang bandit gangs. On December 9th, Generals Deng Xihou, Pan Wenhua, and I sent a telegram announcing our uprising. The People's Liberation Army rapidly pressed in from eastern and northern Sichuan, encircling the enemy, causing Chiang Kai-shek's hundreds of thousands of remnant bandits to either rise up or surrender. As Deputy Chief of General Staff Nie reported the day before yesterday, "This played a role in quickly disintegrating the enemy army and better maintaining local order." However, in terms of the entire revolutionary movement, this small contribution is really insignificant and not worth mentioning. At the same time, I feel that my class background has limited me for more than a decade, my feudal consciousness has confused me, and I have not been resolute or thorough enough. It was not until this uprising that I truly joined the revolutionary ranks, and I am still afraid it is too late.

　　Here, I cannot help but sincerely admire the greatness of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. They not only do not hold my past against me but also give me the opportunity to serve the people. From now on, I will definitely study hard, transform myself, and serve the people wholeheartedly under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. The past is like yesterday's death; the future is like today's birth.

　　Secondly, I would like to talk about the land reform issue. After listening to Vice Chairman Liu's report on the land reform issue, reading the draft land reform law drafted by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and participating in several group discussions, I have personally come to a conclusion: China must thoroughly implement land reform. This is "inevitable" and beyond doubt. If we waver in the slightest on land reform, our revolution will be abandoned halfway. All the methods proposed this time can be said to be reasonable and rational, correcting all past deviations and shortcomings. What is particularly important is that we are only abolishing the feudal land ownership system of the landlords and abolishing the landlord class, but not eliminating them physically. We will also allocate them a share of land and give them the opportunity to transform themselves into new people through labor. This is very generous. In addition, preserving the rich peasant economy is also a very important and appropriate decision because this can isolate the landlords and unite a greater number of people, making land reform easier and smoother to carry out.

　　Here, I also want to frankly say to everyone that I am a big landlord, or as they say in Sichuan, a "big gentry-landlord." I will unconditionally and unreservedly dedicate all my land to the farmers. Before the implementation of land reform, I will of course also pay grain taxes in accordance with regulations. Today is the time for all "big gentry-landlords" in Sichuan and Xikang to awaken! If we still vainly attempt to resist or delay this major reform, which has taken place over thousands of years, it will be a dead end! As for the issue of grain requisition and taxation in Sichuan and Xikang after liberation, there have indeed been many deviations in the work process, but I am confident that these are only temporary phenomena. Under the leadership of the correct policies of the Central Committee, all difficulties and shortcomings will inevitably be gradually overcome and put on the right track. I am even more confident that the compatriots in Sichuan, Xikang, and even the Southwest will be able to awaken in time and welcome land reform. I dare to predict that land reform will be successfully completed next winter.

　　Finally, I would also like to say a few words about the so-called bandit problem in Sichuan and Xikang, which everyone is concerned about. The U.S. imperialists and the Chiang bandit gang are all spreading rumors and exaggerating the strength of the Sichuan bandits, even saying that there are hundreds of thousands of guerrillas, and so on, which are all shameless lies. In fact, the Sichuan bandits have their historical reasons, and there are conspiracies orchestrated by U.S. and Chiang bandit spies, but their strength is not great. Our government is adhering to the principle of combining suppression policies with lenient policies. Those who are the main culprits will definitely be severely punished, and those who have been coerced will be treated leniently by the government as long as they awaken and return. Now our government and the People's Liberation Army are using great efforts to suppress them, and they will be completely eliminated soon.

　　Today, due to time constraints, I can only talk about this little bit. These few days of meetings have been like attending classes every day for me. Everyone here is my teacher, especially Chairman Mao, who is the teacher of all the people of our country. If what I have said is incorrect, I would also like to ask for your guidance!

### 特邀列席起义将领  刘文辉的发言

　　特邀列席起义将领
    刘文辉的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】起义将领刘文辉二十一日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    这次人民政协全国委员会举行第二次会议，文辉被特别邀请来列席，觉得非常的光荣，同时也觉得非常的惭愧。这几天听到了毛主席的开幕词，刘副主席关于土改问题的报告，周总理的政治报告，以及其他各位首长关于各项工作的报告，真使我万分的感动，衷心的拥护。现在我想简单的说一点我的感想：首先要说我自己。我今天能在这里开会，说起来真是惭愧极了！
    我自从一九一四年在保定军官学校毕业，为国服务以来，满想做点救民于水火，使中国国富兵强，俾能立足于世界的事情。所以在带兵的时候，我就想扩大武力，统一川康，统一西南，以求局部实现我的宏愿。殊不知这种脱离群众的个人主义、英雄主义的思想，只能发展为封建割据，军阀争权，丝毫没有替人民谋到幸福，反而扰害了人民还不自觉。至今思之，这都是我应该十二万分引咎的事情。
    大家都知道，我一向是反蒋的。虽然中间也曾经有过迁就妥协，那完全是为了“保存实力，维持地盘”。不过，我内心始终是反蒋，这一点大家是可以相信的。但是，“反蒋”并不等于“革命”。事实上，我过去许多想法和做法，在今天看来，是犯了很严重的错误，违反了革命和人民利益的。
    由于反蒋的原因，大家都知道，十几年来，远在抗战之初，我一直是和革命力量，包括中共、民盟、民革及其他民主党派团体和个人均有密切的关系或组织。这些朋友，先后予我以指导协助，若干事件，得以应付裕如。去年蒋介石节节向西南败退，妄冀以西南为根据，以延长战争时间，我就同邓锡侯、潘文华两将军与民盟、民革、中共的负责同志们秘密策定动员川康军队和各阶层人民团结一致，配合解放军，消灭蒋胡王匪帮的办法。十二月九日，我与邓锡侯、潘文华两将军通电起义，解放军从川东川北很神速的压迫包围拢来，使蒋介石的好几十万残匪，起义的起义，投降的投降。正如聂副总参谋长前天所报告的，“这对于迅速瓦解敌军，及较好的维持地方秩序，是起了作用的。”然而，从整个的革命运动来说，这一点作用与贡献，实在是颇为渺小算不了什么。同时我感觉到十多年来，阶级出身限制了我，封建意识迷糊了我，不够坚决，不够彻底，一直到这次起义，才算真正为走进革命队伍中来，还嫌失之太晚。
    在这里，我不能不衷心的感佩毛主席和中国共产党的伟大，他们不仅不究我的既往，还给我为人民服务的机会。从今以后，我一定要努力学习，改造自己，在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，全心全意的为人民服务。过去种种，譬如昨日死，以后种种，譬如今日生。
    其次，我想谈一谈土改问题。听了刘副主席关于土改问题的报告，看到中共中央所起草的土地改革法草案，又经过几次小组会议的讨论，我个人已经得到一个结论，那就是中国必须彻底的实行土地改革。这是“势在必行”，无可置疑的。假如我们对于土改稍有动摇，那我们的革命就将半途而废。这次所提的一切办法，可以说都是合情合理的，纠正了过去的一切偏差和缺点。特别重要的是我们对于地主，只是废除他们的封建的土地所有制，废除地主这一个阶级，而不是消灭他们的肉体，还要分给他们一份土地，给他们劳动改造成为新人的机会。这是非常宽大的。此外保存富农经济，也是一个非常重大而适当的决策，因为这样可以孤立地主，团结更大多数的人民，土改也就更容易顺利的进行了。
    这里我还要向大家坦白的说，我就是一个大地主，拿四川话来说就是“大绅粮”。我将无条件无保留的献出我所有的一切土地，分给农民，在没有实行土改以前，当然还要照章缴纳粮税。今天是川康所有“大绅粮”应该觉悟的时候了！假如对这几千年历史的大改革还要妄想抗拒拖延，那就是死路一条！至于说川康解放后，关于征粮收税问题，在进行工作中，确是发生不少的偏差，但是我敢相信，这都是一些暂时的现象，在中央的正确政策的领导之下，一切的困难与缺点，必然会逐渐克服，并将走入正轨的。我更相信川康乃至西南的同胞们，一定能够及时觉悟，欢迎土改，我敢预言，明冬土改，一定能顺利的完成。
    最后我还想谈几句大家所关心的所谓川康土匪问题。美帝和蒋匪帮都在造谣，过份夸大四川土匪的力量，竟然说有好几十万游击队，如何如何，这都是无耻的说谎。其实四川土匪是有其历史性的，美蒋匪特策动的阴谋是有的，但是力量并不大。我们政府本着镇压政策，与宽大政策相结合的方针，对首恶者必定严办，对于胁从者只要觉悟来归，政府一定是从宽处理的。现在我们政府和人民解放军，正用大力清剿，不久会完全肃清的。
    今天因为时间关系，我只能谈这一点点。这几天开会，对于我等于天天在上课。各位先生都是我的老师，特别是毛主席是我们全国人民的老师。我所说的如有不正确的地方，还要请各位先生指教！
