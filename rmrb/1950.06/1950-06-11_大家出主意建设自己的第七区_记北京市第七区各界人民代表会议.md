　　Everyone Offers Ideas to Build Their Own Seventh District
    A Record of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in the Seventh District of Beijing
    Zhu Youqiong
    "Everyone handles matters that concern everyone, and the people manage their own government." These are the two slogans of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in the Seventh District of Beijing, and they symbolize the spirit of this conference. At this meeting, the people and the people's government discussed together many issues related to public welfare, health construction, and other matters within the district in a harmonious and cooperative manner. It was the first time ever that more than one hundred citizen representatives gathered together to discuss public affairs in the district.

    The Seventh District is where the laboring people live. The reactionary government in the past consistently despised and oppressed the laboring people. In terms of health construction in the district, many necessary facilities were lacking, let alone "welfare." Therefore, the Seventh District became the dirtiest district in the entire city. There was not a single asphalt road in the entire district, and the dirt roads were uneven, making them difficult to travel after rain. The ditches were filled with sludge and excrement everywhere. In particular, the garbage piled up in Longxu Ditch emitted a foul odor in the summer or when the wind blew in the spring. Among the 105,000 residents of the entire district, only 8 percent could drink tap water. The well water from private merchants mostly contained E. coli, which had a great impact on the health of the residents. In terms of culture and education, the Seventh District was also the most backward, with 59 percent of the residents over the age of six being illiterate.

    After liberation, the People's Government, adhering to the municipal construction policy of serving production first and taking care of the welfare of the laboring people, first repaired several major hutongs in the Seventh District and began to repair the four major trunk roads in the district; excavated the Houheyan sewer, the moat, the Dashi Bridge, and the Longxu Ditch; cleared the accumulated garbage and excrement; and installed new tap water trunk lines and added tap water stations, greatly improving the environmental sanitation of the Seventh District. Under the leadership of the Municipal Public Health Bureau and the Municipal Women's Federation, a maternal and child health experimental zone was established to conduct childbirth education for the general public. Women with difficult labor were also saved through scientific childbirth. The government also established workers' night schools, adult night schools, spare-time schools, and children's literacy classes, giving the laboring people and their children the opportunity to study.

    The representatives had all personally suffered oppression from the Kuomintang reactionary government. In the past, they dared not speak of their suffering, let alone make suggestions to the government or ask the government to do this or that. Today, the people have turned over, and they deeply know that the government is working for the people, and the people should assist the government in carrying out various construction undertakings. When discussing the construction of dirt roads and the repair of houses, the representatives unanimously believed that under the current circumstances of national financial difficulties, the government has many major tasks to undertake, and these minor matters should be handled by themselves. Chen Jingyi, an elementary school teacher, said, "We should give full play to our high sense of ownership and consciously and voluntarily repair the dirt roads. Don't rely on the government for this small matter; repairing the section in front of our own house will connect to form a very good road." At the same time, the government is also acting in a pragmatic spirit. For example, the workers requested to establish a worker's clinic, but the government, within the limits of its financial capacity and according to actual needs, is preparing to establish two. Residents proposed to add nine sewage pools, and the government decided to add eighteen. Hu Huiqun, an employee of the Yuhua Xing Weaving Factory, said, "How should we repay the government for treating us like this?" He affirmed, "We workers should strive to develop production."

    A warm and harmonious atmosphere filled the venue. The representatives unanimously stated that they would implement the spirit of the conference into every corner of the Seventh District and mobilize all residents of the district to implement the resolutions of the conference and jointly build the Seventh District well. Chen Zhuming, a housewife, said, "We must work together to help the government do a good job." When a group of Young Pioneers wearing red scarves presented flowers to the conference, they said in their congratulatory message, "We must follow the Communist Party and the Youth League to study hard, train our bodies well, and inherit your cause in the future to serve the people."

　　大家出主意建设自己的第七区
    记北京市第七区各界人民代表会议
    诸有琼
    “大家的事情大家办，自己的政府自己管。”这是北京市第七区各界人民代表会议的两条标语，也正象征着这次会议的精神。在这次会上，人民和人民的政府和衷共济地在一起商量了区内许多有关公共福利卫生建设等问题。像这样一百多个市民代表在一块儿商量区里的公事，这还是区里破天荒的第一遭。
    第七区是劳动人民集居的地方，过去的反动政府一贯轻视压迫劳动人民，区内在卫生建设方面，许多必要的设施都没有，更不用说“福利”了。因此第七区成为全市最脏的一区，全区没有一条柏油路，土路凹凸不平，雨后泥泞难行；沟渠里积着污泥、粪便到处都有，尤其是龙须沟里堆积的垃圾，在夏天或春天刮风时，臭气薰人。全区十万五千居民中，只有百分之八能吃到自来水，私商的井水里大多含有大肠菌，对居民健康影响很大。文化教育方面，七区也最落后，六岁以上的居民百分之五十九都是文盲。
    解放以后，人民政府本着首先为生产服务，照顾劳动人民福利的市政建设方针，先在七区修整了几条主要的胡同，并动工修整区内的四条大干路；掏挖后河沿下水道，护城河，大石桥和龙须沟；清除了积存的垃圾、粪便；并新按自来水干管，添设自来水站，使七区环境卫生得到大大的改善。又在市公共卫生局和市妇联领导下建立了妇婴卫生实验区，对广大群众进行接生教育，难产的产妇也因科学的接生而保全了生命。政府并办了工人夜校，成人夜校，业余学校和儿童识字班，使劳动人民和他们的孩子也有了读书的机会。
    代表们都亲身受过国民党反动政府的压迫，过去是有苦不敢说，更不用说向政府提意见，要求政府办这办那了。今天人民翻身了，他们都深切地知道政府是为人民办事的，人民就应该好好协助政府来进行各项建设事业。在讨论到修土路和修缮房屋时，代表们一致认为在目前国家财政困难的情况下，政府有许多大事要作，这些小事就应该自己来动手。小学教员陈静怡说：“我们应该发挥高度的主人翁的感觉，自觉自愿地来修土路，这点小事不要依赖政府；自己修自己门前的一段，连接起来就成为一条很好的路了。”同时，政府也是本着实事求是的精神来办事，如工人要求办一个工人诊疗所，政府却在财力许可的范围内根据实际需要，预备办两个；居民提出要添设九个秽水池，政府决定添设十八个。裕华兴织布厂职员胡惠群说：“政府这样对待我们，我们应该怎样来报答呢？”他肯定地说：“我们工人就应该努力发展生产。”
    热烈和谐的气氛充满了会场。代表们一致表示要把大会的精神贯彻到七区的每一个角落，并动员全区居民执行大会的决议，共同把七区搞好。家庭妇女陈珠明说：“我们一定要齐心协力帮助政府办好事情。”在一批系着红领巾的少年儿童队员向大会献花时，他们在贺词中说：“我们一定要跟着共产党，青年团好好学习，练好身体，将来好继承你们的事业，为人民服务。”
