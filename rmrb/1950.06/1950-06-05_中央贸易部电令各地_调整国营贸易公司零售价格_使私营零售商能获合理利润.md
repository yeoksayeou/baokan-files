Xinhua News Agency, June 4th—The Central People's Government's Ministry of Trade telegraphed all state-owned trading companies across the country on the 1st of this month to adjust their retail prices to enable private retailers to obtain reasonable profits.

　　After studying price reports from various regions, the Ministry of Trade discovered some unreasonable phenomena in the wholesale and retail prices controlled by state-owned trading companies. For example, in some places, the difference between wholesale and retail prices was very small; in some places, wholesale and retail prices were the same; and in some places, retail prices were even lower than wholesale prices. These abnormal phenomena have affected the reasonable operation of legitimate private retail businesses. In order to correct these abnormal phenomena, the Ministry of Trade specifically telegraphed all state-owned trading companies to immediately adjust retail prices. The circular pointed out that: when determining retail prices, it is necessary to stipulate them based on retail costs (including wholesale prices, freight, miscellaneous fees, taxes, and losses) and reasonable profit margins, so that private retailers can obtain reasonable profits. At the same time, it instructed local trade administrative agencies to earnestly check and urge local trading companies to strictly implement this circular from the date of receipt.

　　中央贸易部电令各地
    调整国营贸易公司零售价格
    使私营零售商能获合理利润
    【新华社四日讯】中央人民政府贸易部于本月一日电令全国各地国营贸易公司将零售价格加以调整，以便使私营零售商能够获得合理的利润。
    贸易部在研究了各地的物价报告之后，发现目前各地国营贸易公司在掌握批发价格与零售价格上存在着一些不合理的现象。例如有的地方批发价格与零售价格的差额很小；有的地方批发价格与零售价格相同；有的地方零售价格竟低于批发价格。这些不正常的现象都影响了正当私营零售商业的合理经营。为了纠正这些不正常的现象，贸易部特电令各地国营贸易公司立即调整零售价格。通令指出：在确定零售价格时，必须根据零售成本（包括批发价格、运费、杂费、税用和损耗等）及合理利润比例来规定，以便使私营零售商能获得合理的利润。同时，指示要求各地贸易行政机关自收到通令之日起，即切实检查并督促各地贸易公司严格执行。
