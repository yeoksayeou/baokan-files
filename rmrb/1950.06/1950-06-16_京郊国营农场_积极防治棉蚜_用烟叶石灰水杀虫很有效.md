　　State-owned Farms on the Outskirts of Beijing Actively Prevent and Control Cotton Aphids
    Smoke Leaf Lime Water is Very Effective for Killing Insects

    [This newspaper reported] State-owned farms on the outskirts of Beijing are experimenting with effective methods to prevent and control cotton aphids. Cotton aphids have been widely found in the cotton fields of state-owned farms and farmers. In the farm's six thousand mu of cotton fields, severely affected cotton plants have one to two hundred aphids, large and small, on each plant, sucking and curling the leaves. Upon hearing this, the Ministry of Agriculture immediately sent personnel to assist in prevention and control. According to preliminary test results, the most effective method is to spray diseased plants with smoke leaf lime water; the insecticidal rate is 85 percent. The second is spraying with tobacco stalk powder lime water, with an insecticidal rate of 80 percent. The preparation method of tobacco stalk powder lime water is: Raw materials: 1 jin of tobacco stalk powder (fine powder ground from tobacco stalks), half a jin of quicklime, 30 jin of water. Method: First, put the tobacco stalk powder into 5 jin of water and mix well, then bring to a boil over a fire for one hour to one and a half hours; separately, use 5 jin of water to slake the lime into lime emulsion; then mix the two solutions together, add 20 jin of clean water, stir well and filter. The farm is vigorously preparing and using it. Smoke leaf lime water is slightly more effective than tobacco stalk lime water, but the cost is higher.

　　京郊国营农场  积极防治棉蚜
    用烟叶石灰水杀虫很有效
    【本报讯】京郊国营农场正试验防治棉蚜的有效办法。国营农场及农民的棉田中，已普遍发现棉蚜。在农场的六千亩棉田中，蚜虫严重的棉株上，每株有大小蚜虫一、二百个，把叶子都吸卷了。农业部闻讯，立即派员前往协助防治。据初步试验结果，最有效的方法是用烟叶石灰水喷洒病株；杀虫率为百分之八十五。其次为烟梗粉石灰水喷射，杀虫率为百分之八十。烟梗粉石灰水的配制法是：原料：烟梗粉（烟梗碾成的细粉）一斤，生石灰半斤，水三十斤。方法：先将烟梗粉放入五斤水中调匀，加火煮沸一小时至一小时半；另以五斤水把石灰化为石灰乳液；然后把二种溶液混合，加入清水二十斤，搅匀过滤后即成。农场正大力配制使用。烟叶石灰水比烟梗石灰水效能稍大，但成本较高。
