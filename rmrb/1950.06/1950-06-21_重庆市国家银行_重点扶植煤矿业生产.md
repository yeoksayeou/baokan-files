    Focuses on Supporting Coal Mine Production
    [Chongqing News] Xinhua Daily News: To focus on supporting industrial production, the Chongqing Branch of the People's Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are providing loans to support coal mine production. During the Anti-Japanese War, the demand for coal from mines near Chongqing increased greatly due to the relocation of factories, resulting in an increase in production and sales from 10,000 to 20,000 tons per month before the war to more than 80,000 tons per month. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the demand for coal shrank sharply due to the eastward relocation and closure of factories. The average monthly output in 1949 was only over 40,000 tons. By the eve of liberation, most of the mines had fallen into a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown. After liberation, in order to solve the financial difficulties of various factories and mines, the People's Government provided loans of more than 3.1 billion yuan to various factories and mines from February to May this year, accounting for slightly less than 50 percent of all industrial loans.
    In addition to loans, various departments of the People's Government also carried out the purchase and ordering of coal reserves. From the time of liberation to the end of April, the Grain Bureau of the Southwest Finance Department purchased 16,400 tons of coal on behalf of various organs and troops in Chongqing, the Southwest Trade Department reserved 16,000 tons of coal for the shipping industry for use during the flood season, and the Southwest Industrial Supply and Marketing Company ordered 53,776 tons of coal from various mines on behalf of various public factories from January to May. The total amount of various purchases and orders reached 86,176 tons. Among them, purchases from private mines accounted for 87.4% of the total purchases.
    Most of the mines that have received government support have already started to improve their management methods, improve labor-capital relations, and strive to improve production. However, there are also individual mines that slander and attack the good intentions of the People's Government's strong support, and still oppress workers in every possible way with the face of the old rulers. The Beibei Baoyuan Coal Mine is one such example. The government has successively provided the mine with loans of more than 1.46 billion yuan, and purchased more than 14,000 tons of coal, but the mine manager, Lan Wenbin, not only did not use the loans to improve management and develop production, but also owed workers' wages for more than two months, which aroused extreme dissatisfaction among the mine's more than 2,000 employees.

### 重庆市国家银行  重点扶植煤矿业生产

　　重庆市国家银行
    重点扶植煤矿业生产
    【重庆讯】新华日报消息：人民银行重庆分行及交通银行为重点扶植工业生产，贷款扶持煤矿业生产。重庆市附近煤矿在抗日战争时期，由于工厂内迁等原因，用煤量大增，致使产销量从战前月产一两万吨增至月产八万余吨。抗战胜利后，由于工厂东迁和倒闭，需煤量顿见萎缩。一九四九年每月平均产量不过四万吨。至解放前夕，大半矿并已陷于停顿和半停顿。解放后，人民政府为解决各厂矿资金周转困难，从今年二至五月份四个月中贷给各厂矿贷款达三十一亿余元，占全部工业贷款的百分之五十弱。
    除贷款外，人民政府各部分又进行了存煤的收购和订购。西南财政部粮食局，从解放后至四月底止，代重庆市内各机关部队代购煤斤一万六千四百吨，西南贸易部为航业界储备洪水时期轮用煤斤一万六千吨，西南工业供销公司代各公营工厂自一至五月份，向各矿订购煤斤五万三千七百七十六吨，各项代购及订购总数达八万六千一百七十六吨。其中向私营矿收购者即达总收购量的百分之八七·四。
    受到政府扶植的各矿，大部均已在着手改进经营方式，改善劳资关系，为搞好生产而努力。但也有个别矿对人民政府大力扶植的好意，反而横加污蔑和攻击，对工人则仍以旧日统治者的面目多方压榨。如北碚宝源煤矿即是一例。政府曾先后贷给该矿贷款十四亿六千余万元，收购煤斤亦达一万四千多吨，但该矿经理蓝文彬不但未将贷款用以改善经营，发展生产，且仍拖欠工人工资达二月多，致引起了该厂二千余职工的极端不满。
