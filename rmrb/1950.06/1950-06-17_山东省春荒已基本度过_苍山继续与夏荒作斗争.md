Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th—Wheat harvesting in Shandong Province is nearing completion, and the spring famine has basically been overcome. However, some areas, such as the four counties in the Yimeng Mountain area, including Cangshan (a newly established county, southwest of Linyi), suffered crop reduction due to spring floods. Therefore, continuing the fight against the summer famine remains a major task for the governments and people of these four counties. According to a survey of Dongshao Village in Cangshan County: of the 240 households with 1,017 people in the village, the devastation caused by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops during the Liberation War was too severe, and the autumn harvest was also poor. During the peak of the spring famine this spring, 448 people were without food. After the People's Government carried out emergency relief, mobilized people to engage in production for self-salvation through work relief programs and organized sideline production, and launched a social mutual assistance movement of free lending, the villagers obtained more than 6,500 catties of grain during the four months of the spring famine, thus overcoming the spring famine. However, subsequently, most of the village's more than 1,300 mu of wheat was flooded, and the entire village could only harvest more than 110,000 catties of wheat. After deducting the various borrowed grains to be repaid and other expenses, the remaining amount averaged only over 40 catties per person, while there are still 75 days until the autumn harvest. Among them, more than 30 severely affected households do not have enough wheat from the harvest to repay their debts. This situation shows that areas where new disasters have occurred or may occur should not become complacent about disaster relief and prevention simply because of the wheat harvest.

　　山东省春荒已基本度过 
    苍山继续与夏荒作斗争
    【新华社济南十二日电】山东省小麦收割即将完，春荒已基本度过。但部分地区如沂蒙山区苍山（新设县，在临沂西南）等四县因春雨成灾，小麦减收，因而继续与夏荒作斗争，仍为该四县政府和人民的重大任务。据苍山县东哨村的调查：该村二百四十户一千零十七人，由于在解放战争中遭蒋匪军的摧残过甚，去秋又告歉收，今春春荒最严重时，断粮者曾达四百四十八人。经人民政府进行急赈，用以工代赈和组织副业生产等方式发动生产自救，并发动自由借贷的社会互济运动，该村灾民在春荒的四个月中共获得粮食六千五百余斤，度过了春荒。但随后该村的一千三百余亩麦子又大部遭水灾，全村仅可收麦十一万余斤。除应还的各项借粮及其他开支以外，所余全村平均每人仅四十余斤，而目前去秋收却还有七十五天。其中三十余户重灾户，所收麦子还不够还债。这种情况说明，已发生新灾情和可能发生灾情的地区，绝不应因麦收而对救灾与防灾有任何松懈情绪。
