Implementation of Fixed Staff and Quota System
　　Labor Bureau Work Efficiency Improved
　　Over 130 Labor Disputes Handled in May
　　[News from Beijing News Agency] Since the Beijing Labor Bureau implemented the fixed staff and quota system for handling labor disputes, work efficiency has significantly improved. In May, a total of 131 labor disputes were handled, with an increase in the number of cases closed compared to the past. On average, each case took a little over six days, shortening the closing time compared to before.
　　In the past, due to cadres not being familiar enough with the business, not having a good grasp of mediation time, and not having close enough contact with relevant units, some cases accumulated and could not be handled in a timely manner; and some factories were affected in their production or business as a result. In response to this situation, the Labor Bureau, based on the actual situation of past case handling and the existing cadre strength and time, carefully calculated and formulated a fixed staff and quota plan: with the existing ten mediators, it was required that ordinary cases be handled within no more than seven days from May, complex or arbitration cases be handled within no more than fourteen days, and at least one hundred dispute cases be handled each month.
　　After the implementation of the fixed staff and quota system, the sense of responsibility of cadres has been strengthened, and mutual assistance has been implemented. Those with higher education help those with lower education to organize materials, and groups with more cases help groups with fewer cases. At the same time, the Labor Bureau also maintains close contact with units such as the Bureau of Industry, the Bureau of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, stipulating that the round trip of each official document should not exceed forty-eight hours.
　　In this way, work efficiency in May has significantly improved compared to the past: 94 cases were handled in March, averaging 14 days per case; 125 cases were handled in April, averaging 8 days per case; 131 cases were handled in May, of which 42 were resolved by mutual agreement between the two parties after explaining the policy, 69 were resolved through mediation, 9 were arbitrated, and 11 were transferred to the court, averaging a little over six days to resolve each case.
　　In terms of quality, the policies are generally correctly grasped. Only in a few cases, because the cadres did not do enough in-depth persuasion and education in order to complete the task as soon as possible, it is necessary to pay attention to how to improve the quality and conduct in-depth persuasion and education in the future.

　　实行定员定额工作制度
    劳动局工作效率提高
    五月份处理劳资纠纷一百三十多件
    【京市新闻处讯】京市劳动局对于劳资争议案件的处理，自实行定员定额制以来，工作效率显著提高。五月份共处理劳资争议一百三十一件，结案的数字较前增多；平均每件需时六天多，结案时间较前缩短。
    过去由于干部对业务尚不够熟悉，没有很好的掌握调解时间，与有关单位的联系不够密切等原因，致使一部分案件积存下来，未能及时处理；且有个别厂号因此影响了生产或营业。针对这种情况，劳动局并根据过去处理案件的实际情况与现有的干部力量和时间，精打细算，制订了定员定额计划：以现有的调解人员十人，要求自五月份起处理普通案件不得超过七天，复杂的或仲裁的案件不得超过十四天，每月至少处理一百件争议案件。
    实行定员定额工作制度后，干部责任心加强，并实行互助，文化高的帮助文化低的整理材料，案件多的组帮助案件少的组；同时劳动局并与工业局、商业局、市总工会、工商联合会等单位密切联系，规定每件公文往返不得超过四十八小时。
    这样，五月份的工作效率已较前显著提高：三月份处理了九十四件，平均每件需时十四天；四月份处理了一百二十五件，平均每件需时八天；五月份处理了一百三十一件，其中经解释政策双方自行和解的四十二件，调解成立的六十九件，仲裁九件，转送法院十一件，平均每件六天多即可解决。
    在质量方面，一般是能正确掌握政策的，只有少数案件，因干部为尽速完成任务，说服教育做的不够深入，因此今后如何提高质量，深入的说服教育，是应该注意的。（黎明）
