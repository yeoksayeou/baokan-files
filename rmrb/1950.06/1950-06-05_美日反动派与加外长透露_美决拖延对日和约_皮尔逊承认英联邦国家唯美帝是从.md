　　US-Japanese Reactionaries and Canadian Foreign Minister Reveal
    US Decision to Delay Japanese Peace Treaty
    Pearson Admits Commonwealth Nations Follow US Lead
    Xinhua News Agency, June 4th, dispatch from TASS New York, June 3rd: Reactionary newspapers in the United States and Japan frankly admitted that the US government is not interested in concluding a peace treaty with Japan because it has decided to use the islands of Japan as military bases in its planned aggression in the Far East. Lippmann wrote in the New York Herald Tribune: The conclusion of a peace treaty is undesirable because Japan is destined to become a US base. The New York correspondent of the Tokyo Japan Times wrote: Due to the policy pursued by the United States, a peace treaty with Japan will not be concluded in the near future. The Asahi Shimbun reported: Japanese Finance Minister Hayato Ikeda declared after returning from the United States that the signing of a peace treaty with Japan is impossible in the short term.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson reveals the US is delaying the Japanese peace treaty. According to a United Press dispatch from Ottawa: Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, who had discussed the so-called "possibility of formally ending the state of war with Japan" with US Secretary of State Acheson and British Foreign Secretary Bevin in London, declared in Ottawa on the 2nd: "The Allied powers will probably sign a peace treaty with Japan at least two years later, and the date will mainly depend on the United States." Pearson also revealed that the United States has decided to continue to implement its plan of "de facto peace" with Japan, saying: "I have found that the United States has not made any special progress in terms of (the Japanese) peace treaty." Speaking of the attitude of the British group towards the Japanese peace treaty, Pearson exposed his submissive policy to the United States, saying: "Canada and other countries of the British Commonwealth will have to wait until the United States is also ready to sign (the Japanese peace treaty)." He also said: He felt that the British Commonwealth countries "cannot really do anything about this issue (referring to the Japanese peace treaty) until the United States decides what to do."

　　美日反动派与加外长透露
    美决拖延对日和约
    皮尔逊承认英联邦国家唯美帝是从
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社纽约三日讯：美日两国反动报纸坦率承认，美国政府对缔结对日和约不感兴趣，因为它决定把日本各岛用作它在远东所计划的侵略中的军事基地。李普曼在纽约先驱论坛报上写道：和约的缔结是不惬意的，因为日本命定要变作美国的基地。东京日本时报的纽约特派记者写道：由于美国所奉行的政策，最近的将来不会缔结对日和约。朝日新闻报道：日本藏相池田勇人由美返国后宣称，对日和约的签定在短期内不可能。
    【新华社四日讯】加拿大外交部长皮尔逊透露美国拖延对日和约。据合众社渥太华讯：在伦敦曾与美国国务卿艾奇逊及英国外相贝文商谈过所谓“正式结束日本战争状态的可能性”的加拿大外长皮尔逊，于二日在渥太华宣称：“盟国签订对日和约，大概至少在两年以后，其日期主要要看美国而定”。皮尔逊并透露美国决定继续实行其对日“不宣而和”的计划，他说：“我发现美国在（对日）和约方面并没有任何特殊的进展”。谈到英国集团对对日和约的态度时，皮尔逊暴露了他驯从美国的政策，他说：“加拿大和不列颠联邦其他国家将必须等待，直到美国也准备签订（对日和约）的时候”。他并且说：他觉得不列颠联邦国家“在美国决定要做什么之前，对这个问题（按指对日和约问题）不能真正有所作为”。
