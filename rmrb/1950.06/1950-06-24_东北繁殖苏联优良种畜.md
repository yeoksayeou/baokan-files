　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st – The first batch of superior livestock purchased from the Soviet Union has begun to be bred in Northeast China, with a focus on key areas. Nong'an County, Jilin Province, a key horse-producing county, has been allocated 108 Ardennes stallions and is now systematically conducting mating. The county's People's Government has specially set up 26 mating stations, all using scientific artificial insemination methods. The farmers greatly appreciate these powerful draft horses and are eagerly bringing their mares for breeding. As of the end of May, more than 4,800 mares have been bred. Another batch of superior breeds of horses, sheep, and pigs are being bred at the Tieling Livestock Farm. The horses in this batch of superior breeds include the Vladimir breed for heavy draft, the Don breed for riding and draft, and the Soviet Trotter for riding, among others. Among them, the Akhal-Teke riding horse can continuously travel 4,300 kilometers in 48 days. The pigs include the fast-growing Ukrainian Large White pig, which can reach a weight of 300 jin (approximately 150 kg) six months after birth. The sheep being bred can each produce eight to nine jin (approximately 4-4.5 kg) of wool, with a high fat content, suitable for manufacturing high-grade wool products. When breeding the above livestock, the Tieling Livestock Farm also uses the new Soviet-style livestock artificial inseminators, which can highly enhance the breeding rate of superior livestock; that is, the inseminator can use a single ejaculate of a ram to inseminate dozens of ewes simultaneously.

　　东北繁殖苏联优良种畜
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】从苏联购进的第一批优良种畜，已在东北开始有重点地进行繁殖。产马重点县的吉林省农安县，被分配到阿尔登种马一百零八匹，现正有计划地进行交配。该县人民政府特设配马站二十六处，全用科学的人工授精法配马。农民群众对这种挽力极强的种马非常喜爱，纷纷牵马前来配种。截至五月底止，已配好四千八百多匹。另有一批马、羊、猪的优良种畜在铁岭种畜场进行繁殖。这批优良种畜中的马有挽重用的弗拉基米尔种，乘挽兼用的顿河种，乘用的苏联速步马等数种，其中阿哈乘用种马，能连续在四十八日间走四千三百公里。猪有生长速度极快的乌克兰大白猪，这种猪出生后六个月，体重即可达三百斤。正在进行繁殖的羊，每只能产羊毛八斤至九斤，毛质含脂肪甚多，可制造高等的毛制品。铁岭种畜场在繁殖以上种畜时，亦应用苏联新式的牲畜人工授精器，这种授精器可使优良种畜高度发挥其繁殖率；即授精器利用羊的一次精液，即可供数十只母羊同时受精。
