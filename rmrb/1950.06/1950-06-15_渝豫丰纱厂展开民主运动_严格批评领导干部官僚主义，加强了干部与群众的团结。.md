(Chongqing News) Chongqing Xinhua Daily News reported: The public-owned Yu Feng Textile Factory in Chongqing, under the direct leadership of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee's Industry Department, launched a democratic movement. Workers raised many opinions on production, wages, leadership style, hygiene, and other issues, sternly criticizing the factory's leadership for its bureaucracy. During the movement, the workers' class consciousness was greatly enhanced, and issues such as wages were reasonably resolved. At the same time, saboteurs were exposed, and the unity between the workers and the leadership cadres was strengthened, and production management has begun to improve.

The employees of Yu Feng Textile Factory actively assisted in completing the takeover work. From December of last year to February of this year, the factory's production was relatively normal. The chief military representative, Liu Zhan, was initially able to approach the workers and was once well-received by the workers. In March, Liu Zhan was appointed as the chief military representative of the Southwest People's Textile Company (to which Yu Feng Textile Factory is affiliated), and from then on, he developed a sense of pride and complacency. He did not delve into the worker masses, did not understand the difficulties existing in production, and did not rely on the workers to solve problems, seriously detaching himself from reality and from the masses.

In February of this year, in order to overcome financial difficulties, Chongqing's public-owned factories began to implement a low-wage system. By March, many factories had smoothly resolved this issue. Yu Feng Textile Factory delayed implementation because it was not yet fully prepared. However, it then failed to deeply mobilize all the factory's workers to discuss the wage issue, only making general appeals during large classes and meetings with a small number of people. In April, the factory handed this issue over to the retained acting factory director to resolve through simple administrative orders. The proposed wage standards were only discussed with male workers, while female workers were kept in the dark, as they were considered "backward," and it was feared that knowing would affect production. As a result, workers became dissatisfied, and special agents took the opportunity to spread rumors, making the problem increasingly complicated and production plunged into chaos. In terms of production management, neither listening to worker opinions nor mobilizing employees to jointly study and discuss solutions. For example, since March, workers had raised issues such as the machine rotation speed being out of sync, the raw cotton not being good, with excessive opening, and prone to thread breakage, but the leadership did not seriously consider them, instead listening to the opinions of some staff members and adopting old management methods, simply increasing the motor speed to increase production. As a result, the workers felt dissatisfied, forming a confrontation between the worker masses and the leadership. In addition, the factory did not listen to worker opinions on personnel matters, and many reasonable and potentially solvable problems raised by workers were delayed and ignored. As a result, the workers' enthusiasm for production decreased, and accidents involving machine damage and burning occurred continuously. The production plan for April was not completed. The amount of raw cotton used per yarn piece also increased from 443 jin in February to 462 jin.

These serious situations attracted the attention of the leadership organs. On May 4th, Wan Li, the person in charge of the Industry Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, and Cai Shufan, the director of the Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and other comrades, went to Yu Feng Textile Factory and convened a meeting of all employees. At the meeting, Director Cai Shufan and Comrade Wan Li both criticized the bureaucratic errors of Liu Zhan, the chief military representative of the factory. Wan Li also made a self-criticism on behalf of the Industry Department, explaining that they had been negligent in inspection in the past, which resulted in the failure to help correct the errors in a timely manner. At the same time, he called on everyone to boldly criticize the leadership cadres and examine their leadership style. The factory's employees were then divided into groups to raise 152 opinions on issues such as production, wages, democracy, and hygiene. Liu Zhan, the chief military representative, also made a deep self-criticism of the mistakes he had made in his work. From May 8th to 16th, the factory convened a temporary employee representative meeting. Director Cai Shufan and Comrade Wan Li both made reports at the meeting. Liu Zhan also made a second self-criticism. The worker representatives, seeing that their opinions were respected and adopted, and that the military representative had also acknowledged his mistakes, were deeply moved. Some representatives who had previously been in opposition to the leadership had largely changed their views. After the representatives relayed the situation at the meeting to the workers, the thinking of all the factory's employees underwent a great change, and they all felt that they were indeed the masters of the factory. When Comrade Wan Li announced that the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee had decided to remove Liu Zhan, the chief military representative of the factory, from his post for the errors he had committed, many workers were so saddened that they cried on the spot. When the news spread to the workshops, the female workers also cried. The workers all said, "Representative Liu is wrong, but we are also wrong. We raised our opinions to get him to change, not to get him to leave." At the meeting, worker representatives, representatives of the trade union preparatory committee, and many workers took the stage to speak, requesting that the chief military representative Liu Zhan be retained, and also examined their own mistakes. After the meeting, the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee accepted the workers' opinions and allowed Liu Zhan to temporarily remain in the factory. At the same time, in small group discussions, worker representatives examined their past errors of not actively engaging in production and put forward many constructive suggestions, requesting to strengthen production management and establish labor discipline. Everyone felt very sorry about the machine damage incidents and actively cooperated in the investigation, uncovering the saboteurs related to the machine damage. The long-delayed issue of implementing the low-wage system was also smoothly resolved. After repeated discussions by the representative meeting, everyone understood the current financial difficulties of the country and agreed to implement the low-wage system. For example, female worker representative Yang Shuzhen said, "They elected me as a representative because they originally wanted me to fight for wages; now that the meeting has been held, I understand that reducing wages is to overcome the country's current financial difficulties, so as to better carry out production and construction in the future. I will definitely convince them when I go back." After the meeting, the workers voluntarily established labor discipline, and each workshop established production guarantee letters, guaranteeing to complete the production tasks. The workers' morale was very high.

Chongqing Xinhua Daily published the above news on May 21st and published an editorial, pointing out that the reason why the leading cadres of Yu Feng Textile Factory made mistakes was mainly because they were busily engaged in trivial matters, forgetting Chairman Mao's earnest admonition to wholeheartedly rely on the working class and unite with other working people in urban work. The facts of Yu Feng Textile Factory before and after prove that bureaucratic people who are divorced from the worker masses are bound to fail; while those who follow the mass line and discuss problems with everyone can solve and overcome all problems and difficulties.

### 渝豫丰纱厂展开民主运动  严格批评领导干部官僚主义，加强了干部与群众的团结。

　　渝豫丰纱厂展开民主运动
    严格批评领导干部官僚主义，加强了干部与群众的团结。
    【重庆讯】重庆新华日报消息：重庆市公营豫丰纱厂，在西南军政委员会工业部直接领导下展开了民主运动，工人对生产、工资、领导作风、卫生等问题，提了很多意见，严正地批评了该厂领导上的官僚主义。在运动中，工人的阶级觉悟大为提高，合理解决了工资等问题。同时检举出破坏分子，加强了工人群众与领导干部的团结，生产管理工作已开始改进。
    豫丰纱厂的职工们曾积极协助完成接管工作。自去年十二月至今年二月，该厂生产亦较正常。总军事代表刘瞻起初尚能接近工人，曾一度得到工人好评。三月，刘瞻被委为西南人民纺织公司（豫丰纱厂隶属该公司）总军事代表，从此即产生骄傲自满情绪，不深入工人群众，不了解生产中存在的困难，不依靠工人解决问题，严重地脱离了实际，脱离了群众。
    今年二月，重庆各公营工厂为了克服财政困难，开始实行低工资制，到三月份，不少工厂都顺利地解决了这一问题。豫丰纱厂当时因酝酿尚未成熟，故延期执行。但此后又未深入发动全厂工人，提出工资问题来讨论，仅在上大课和少数人开会时作过一般性的号召。四月间，该厂把这一问题交由留用的代厂长以简单的行政命令方式来解决。只把拟订的工资标准交给男工讨论了一下，却瞒着女工，以为女工“落后”，怕知道了影响生产。结果引起工人不满，特务分子乘机造谣，使问题越来越复杂，生产陷于混乱状态。在生产管理上，既不听取工人意见，又不发动职工共同研究讨论来解决问题。如三月份以来，工人们提出机器转动速度失调，原棉不大好，开花多，容易断线等问题，领导上未认真考虑，却听信部分职员的意见，采用旧的管理办法，简单地以加紧马达来增加产量。结果工人感到不满，形成工人群众与领导上的对立。此外，该厂在处理人事问题上也不听工人意见，平时工人提出的许多合理的和可能解决的问题，也拖延不理。因之，该厂工人的生产积极性降低，连续发生机器损坏与烧毁的事故。四月份没有完成生产计划。每件纱所用原棉也由二月份的四四三斤增至四六二斤。
    这些严重情况引起了领导机关的重视。五月四日，西南军政委员会工业部负责人万里和全国总工会西南办事处主任蔡树藩等同志都到了豫丰纱厂，召开了全体员工大会。会上，蔡树藩主任和万里同志都批评了该厂总军事代表刘瞻的官僚主义的错误。万里并代表工业部作了检讨，说明过去疏于检查，以致未能及时帮助改正。同时他号召大家向领导干部大胆进行批评，检查领导作风。全厂职工继即划分小组，就生产、工资、民主、卫生等问题，提出了一百五十二条意见。总军事代表刘瞻亦就工作中所犯错误，作了深刻的检讨。五月八日至十六日，该厂召开了临时职工代表会，蔡树藩主任和万里同志都在会上作了报告。刘瞻也作了第二次检讨。工人代表看到自己提的意见受到了尊重和采纳，军代表也检讨了错误，都深深地被感动了。有些代表过去和领导上抱对立态度的，大都有了转变。代表们把会上情形转告工人后，全厂职工的思想起了很大变化，都感到自己确实是工厂的主人了。当万里同志宣布西南军政委员会对该厂总军事代表刘瞻所犯错误予以撤职处分时，许多工人难过得当场哭了起来。消息传到车间，女工们也哭了。工人们都说：“刘代表有错，我们也有错。我们提意见是要他改，不是要他走。”会场上，工人代表会代表、工会筹委会代表以及许多工人都上台讲话，要求保留总军事代表刘瞻，并检讨了自己的错误。会后，西南军政委员会接受了工人的意见，允许刘瞻暂时留任该厂。同时，在小组讨论会上，工人代表纷纷检讨了自己过去不积极生产的错误，并提出了许多建设性的意见，要求加强生产管理，订立劳动纪律。对损坏机器的事件大家都感到很痛心，积极协同调查，查出了与破坏机器有关的破坏分子。久延未决的实行低工资制问题，也顺利地解决了。代表会反复讨论之后，大家明白了国家当前的财政困难情形，都同意实行低工资制。如女工代表杨淑珍说：“她们选我当代表，原是要我来争工资的；现在开了会，我明白了减低工资是为了克服国家当前财政困难，以便今后更好地进行生产建设。我回去一定说服她们。”会后，工人们自动地订立了劳动纪律，各车间订立了生产保证书，保证完成生产任务。工人们的情绪很高。
    重庆新华日报于五月二十一日刊出了上述新闻，并发表社论，指出豫丰纱厂的领导干部之所以犯错误，主要是因为辛辛苦苦地忙于枝节问题，而忘记了毛主席所谆谆告诫的在城市工作中要全心全意依靠工人阶级，团结其他劳动人民的正确方针。豫丰纱厂的前后事实证明，脱离工人群众的官僚主义者一定失败；而走群众路线，有问题和大家商量，则一切问题，一切困难都可以解决和克服。
