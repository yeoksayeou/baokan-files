　　Municipal Health Committee Convenes District Heads and Others for Meeting
    Deploys Summer Hygiene Campaign Work
    Decides on Citywide Indoor and Outdoor Cleanup at the Beginning of Next Month
    [Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal Health Committee convened a meeting at the Municipal Government on the 17th, attended by district heads, heads of public security sub-bureaus, and heads of health clinics from various districts of Beijing, to deploy the summer hygiene campaign. Vice Mayor Wu Han presided over the meeting. In his speech, Vice Mayor Wu Han pointed out that the summer hygiene work should implement the principle of "prevention first, medical treatment second." He said that we should learn from the experience of the Lüda area in eliminating encephalitis through good preventive work, and all units should give due importance to summer hygiene work. Zhang Wenqi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Public Health Bureau, reported that the smallpox vaccination work this year has been done well. From January to May, only eleven people in the city contracted smallpox, with four deaths, a significant improvement compared to the same period last year, when one hundred and ninety people contracted smallpox and ninety people died. However, last year, due to insufficient overall hygiene work, there were 986 cases of dysentery, 273 deaths, 196 cases of encephalitis, and 105 deaths. This year, we must do a good job in summer epidemic prevention work to change this serious situation.
    The meeting decided that the central task of the summer hygiene campaign is to eliminate flies and mosquitoes. Fly and mosquito eradication teams will be established throughout the city to carry out extermination work. It is also necessary to conscientiously implement preventive vaccinations, improve environmental sanitation, strengthen the management of food vendors and stalls, manage drinking water, and call for the establishment of health covenants. The meeting decided that each district and each agency should immediately establish health committees, sub-committees, health teams and other organizations.
    [Further News] The Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau has decided to mobilize citizens to carry out a citywide indoor and outdoor cleanup from July 3rd to 8th, conduct inspections from the 10th to the 15th, and start immediately to repair and renovate public toilets based on urgency.

    【京市新闻处讯】北京市卫生委员会于十七日在市府召集京市各区长、公安分局长、卫生所长开会，布置夏季卫生运动工作。会议由吴晗副市长主持。吴副市长讲话时指出夏季卫生工作应贯彻“预防为主，医疗为辅”的方针，应学习旅大地区由于做好预防工作而消灭了大脑炎的经验，各单位应对夏季卫生工作给以应有的重视。市公共卫生局张文奇副局长报告今年牛痘接种工作做得较好，一月到五月间全市只有十一人患天花，四人死亡，比较去年同时期中一百九十人患天花，九十人死亡已大有进步；但去年由于整个卫生工作开展得不够，曾有九百八十六人患赤痢，二百七十三人死亡，一百九十六人患大脑炎，一百零五人死亡，今年必须作好夏季防疫工作，改变这种严重现象。
    会上决定夏季卫生运动中心工作是灭蝇灭蚊。全市普遍建立灭蝇、灭蚊小组，展开扑灭工作。并切实执行预防注射、改善环境卫生、加强饮食店业摊贩管理、饮水管理、号召建立卫生公约等项工作。会上决定各区及各机关应即成立卫生委员会、分会、卫生小组等机构。
    【又讯】市卫生工程局决定自七月三日至八日发动市民举行全市户内外大扫除，十日至十五日举行检查，并自即日开始分别缓急修建整补公共厕所等工作。
