MacArthur, the executor of the U.S. government's policy of monopolizing Japan, issued an extremely absurd and reactionary order to the Japanese Yoshida government on the 6th. This order stipulates "revoking and expelling all members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party from public office" and "subjecting them" to "the various prohibitions, restrictions, and constraints of the purge order and its supplementary decrees issued by" MacArthur "on January 4, 1946." As a result of this heinous "purge," all twenty-four Central Committee members of the Japanese Communist Party, led by Tokuda Kyuichi and Nosaka Sanzo, have been deprived of the right to "engage in public duties," "hold any party membership or engage in any public political activities." Their positions as members of the House of Councillors and House of Representatives, legally elected by Japanese voters, have also been stripped away. MacArthur attempts, with this dictatorial order, to dismantle the leading organ of the Japanese Communist Party—the Central Committee—in one fell swoop and clear the way for the impending declaration of the Japanese Communist Party as illegal.

It should be pointed out that MacArthur's directive is not only a ferocious attack on the Japanese Communist Party but also a ferocious attack on the future of the entire Japanese nation. Under the policies of colonization and base construction by American imperialism, Japan today is in a tragic situation of worker unemployment, small and medium-sized enterprise bankruptcies, and rural decline. Therefore, since the beginning of this spring, the Japanese people have launched a movement against the American occupation. The broad masses of the Japanese people have clearly realized that in order to strive for independence, democracy, and world peace, and to strive for their own survival rights, they must wage a resolute struggle against the American occupiers. This movement of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism, from the May Day demonstration of 600,000 people in Tokyo to the movement to expel Eells, the educational advisor to MacArthur's headquarters, from the May 30th Tokyo People's Congress to the June 3rd National General Uprising Congress, is rising step by step with the force of a raging tide. This movement is so widespread that from young students to workers, from scientists to educators, from the Communist Party to all conservative parties except the Liberal Party, have been involved in this movement to varying degrees. This huge movement has seriously shaken the foundation of U.S. imperialism's rule in Japan. Therefore, in order to maintain his enslaving rule over the Japanese people, MacArthur launched this shameful attack on the organizers and inspirers of this just movement of the Japanese people—the Japanese Communist Party. Following this shameful attack, there will inevitably be a series of attacks on all democratic forces in Japan and on the survival prospects of the entire Japanese nation. Obviously, under MacArthur's cruel attacks, if the Japanese people fail to mount an appropriate and effective counterattack, then the Japanese nation will ultimately be driven to the road of destruction again by today's Tojo—MacArthur; therefore, the Japanese people must not allow MacArthur to achieve his goals.

When issuing this directive, MacArthur, in order to conceal his ulterior motives, "cited" the Potsdam Declaration and the basic policies of the Far Eastern Commission, claiming that "the fundamental purpose of the occupation of Japan has always been to help the Japanese people fulfill the obligations stipulated for them by the Potsdam Declaration." This is a completely shameless lie. As everyone knows, the Potsdam Declaration stipulated that Japanese war criminals must be severely punished and that aggressive and militaristic forces must be permanently eradicated. But on the other hand, the Potsdam Declaration also stipulated that the Japanese government must remove all obstacles preventing the revival and strengthening of the democratic trends of the Japanese people, and guarantee freedom of speech, thought, and respect for fundamental human rights. In its resolution on "Basic Post-Surrender Policy Toward Japan," the Far Eastern Commission, in addition to making resolutions similar to the Potsdam Declaration, specifically stipulated that the establishment of democratic parties and labor unions must be encouraged. It can be seen from this that MacArthur's directive, like all his reactionary measures such as releasing war criminals in Japan, is not only inconsistent with the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy toward Japan but is also fundamentally going in the opposite direction.

MacArthur's directive even violates the "Purge Order" he himself issued on January 4, 1946. According to the "Purge Order," those who should be purged and prohibited from holding public office are: (1) active advocates of militaristic nationalism and aggression; (2) important figures in all extreme nationalist groups and terrorist groups; (3) important figures in the activities of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society, and the Greater Japan Political Association. This directive clearly stipulates that it is aimed at the militarists and aggressors of Japan. Therefore, it simply cannot apply to the Japanese Communist Party, the most determined organizers of anti-militarism and anti-aggression forces among the Japanese people. MacArthur's citation of this "Purge Order" only exposes his own shameless disregard for good faith.

It should be pointed out that MacArthur's directive is part of the U.S. policy of preparing for war in the Far East. The reason why MacArthur launched this vicious attack on the Japanese Communist Party is to further intensify the transformation of Japan into a U.S. military base in the Far East, using the Japanese people as cannon fodder in the new war of aggression that the United States is actively preparing for. Therefore, MacArthur's directive, which completely violates the Potsdam Declaration, is also an attack on the peace-loving people of the world, especially the peace-loving people of the Far East. In order to smash MacArthur's attack and support the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese patriotic democratic forces, all peace-loving people have a responsibility to unite and lodge serious protests with the U.S. government and MacArthur, demanding the revocation of the reactionary order to "purge" the Japanese Communist Party and an end to the tyrannical rule of MacArthur and the U.S. occupation forces over Japan!

### 反对麦克阿瑟镇压日本爱国人民的前卫——日本共产党！

　　反对麦克阿瑟镇压日本爱国人民的前卫——日本共产党！
    美国政府独占日本政策的执行者麦克阿瑟，于六日向日本吉田政府，发出一个极端荒谬反动的指令。这个指令规定“撤销与摈斥日本共产党中央委员会全体委员的公职”，并“使他们服从”麦克阿瑟“在一九四六年一月四日所发出的整肃令及其补充法令的各项禁令、限制与约束”。由于这种罪恶的“整肃”的结果，日共中央委员会以德田球一、野坂参三为首的全体二十四名中央委员，已横被剥夺了“从事公共职务”，“保有任何党籍或从事任何公开的政治活动”的权利。他们之中经由日本选民合法地选出的参、众议员职位，也被剥夺了。麦克阿瑟企图以他这一独裁的命令，把日本共产党的首脑机关——中央委员会，一下打散，并为正在准备中的宣布日共为非法，扫清道路。
    应当指出，麦克阿瑟这一指令，不仅是对日本共产党的凶恶进攻，而且是对日本整个民族前途的凶恶进攻。在美帝国主义的殖民化与基地化的政策下，日本今天正陷于工人失业，中小企业破产，农村凋敝的悲惨境地。因此，自今年春初以来，日本人民就掀起了一个反对美国占领的运动。广大的日本人民已经明确地认识到，他们为了争取独立、民主与世界和平，为了争取他们切身的生存权利，他们就必须对美国占领者展开坚决的斗争。日本人民这一反对美帝国主义的运动，从五一节的东京六十万人大示威到驱逐麦克阿瑟总部教育顾问意尔斯的运动，从五月三十日的东京人民大会到六月三日的全国总奋起大会，正以怒涛之势，步步高涨。这一运动是如此广泛，以致从青年学生到工人，从科学家到教育家，从共产党到除了自由党以外的所有保守政党，都或多或少地卷入了这一运动。这一巨大的运动，严重地动摇了美帝国主义在日本的统治基础。因此，麦克阿瑟为了维持他对日本人民的奴役统治，就对日本人民这一正义的运动的组织者与鼓舞者——日本共产党，发动这个可耻的攻击。在这一可耻的攻击之后，接着到来的，必然将是对日本一切民主势力，对日本全民族的生存前途的一系列的进攻。显然地，在麦克阿瑟这种残酷的进攻下，日本人民如果不能予以适当而有效的反击，那么，日本民族终将被今天的东条——麦克阿瑟，再次驱至毁灭的道路；因此，日本人民是决不能允许麦克阿瑟达到他的目的的。
    麦克阿瑟在发表这一指令时，为了掩盖他不可告人的目的，曾“引证”了波茨坦宣言，远东委员会的基本政策，扬言“占领日本的基本目的，一向就是帮助日本人民履行波茨坦宣言给他们规定的义务”。这完全是无耻的谎言。尽人皆知，波茨坦宣言曾经规定，日本的战犯必须严惩，侵略势力与军国主义势力，必须永久铲除。但另一方面，波茨坦宣言又规定：日本政府必须除去阻止日本人民民主趋势的复活与增强的一切障碍，保障言论、思想的自由及对基本人权的尊重。远东委员会在其“日本投降后对日基本政策”的决议中，除了作出与波茨坦宣言类似的决议外，更具体地规定：对于民主政党及工人工会的建立，必须予以鼓励。由此可见，麦克阿瑟这一指令，如同他在日本释放战犯等一切的反动措施一样，不但与波茨坦宣言及远东委员会的对日基本政策毫无一致之处，而且是根本是南辕北辙，完全相反。
    麦克阿瑟这一指令，甚至也违反了他自己在一九四六年一月四日发布的“整肃令”。根据该“整肃令”，应被清洗不得担任公共职务者是：（一）军国主义的国家主义与侵略的积极倡导者；（二）一切极端的国家主义团体、恐怖主义团体中的重要分子；（三）大政翼赞会、翼赞政治会、大日本政治会活动中的重要分子。这个指令明白地规定，它是针对着日本的军国主义者与侵略主义分子的。因此，它对日本人民中反军国主义、反侵略势力的最坚决的组织者——日本共产党，根本不能适用。麦克阿瑟援引这个“整肃令”，只是暴露他自己是无耻地不顾信义。
    应当指出，麦克阿瑟这一指令，乃是美国在远东的备战政策的一部分。麦克阿瑟之所以如此对日共发动这一凶恶的进攻，是为了进一步加紧变日本为美国在远东的军事基地，利用日本人民充当美国正在积极准备的新侵略战争中的炮灰。因此，麦克阿瑟这一完全违背波茨坦宣言的指令，同时也是对世界爱好和平的人民，首先是远东爱好和平人民的一个进攻。为了粉碎麦克阿瑟这一进攻，声援日本共产党及日本爱国民主势力，一切爱好和平的人民有责任联合起来，向美国政府和麦克阿瑟提出严重的抗议，要求撤销“整肃”日本共产党的反动命令，并且结束麦克阿瑟和美国占领军对于日本的横暴统治！
