　　County and District Leading Cadres Should Read Newspapers
　　*In the Central South Region, County and District Leaders Rarely Read Newspapers. The Ministry of Agriculture's Spring Plowing Inspection Team Offers Criticism and Suggestions*

To the Editor:

　　During our recent inspection of spring plowing in the Central South region, we had extensive contact with leading comrades from county and district leadership organs. We felt that their understanding of many extremely important decisions and instructions from the Central Committee, even from the Greater Administrative Area and provinces, as well as many guiding articles, was either not deep or, in many cases, completely unknown. We consciously investigated the reasons for this and discovered that many comrades do not read newspapers. In some counties, there are only one or two copies of the People's Daily, and in some counties, there are none. The Yangtze Daily is also rare. There are more provincial newspapers, but not many people read them. Many comrades, even key leaders at the county level, often do not look at the newspaper for three to five days, or even a week. They mainly rely on meetings and documents directly issued by higher authorities to guide their work. This limits their ability to absorb experiences from other regions, restricts their knowledge to a small area, reduces their ability to improve their policy principles, and lowers their work efficiency. Why don't they read newspapers and subscribe to them?

　　(1) The common reflection is that institutions are not sound, tasks are too heavy, and there is not enough time and energy.

　　(2) Newspapers are not distributed in a timely manner, especially in rural areas, where they are seen even later, often ten days to two weeks late.

　　(3) Financial difficulties. They have to subscribe to provincial newspapers, as well as newspapers from the Greater Administrative Area and the Central Committee.

　　(4) Low level of education, unable to understand, therefore not interested in newspapers.

　　How to improve this situation? We offer the following opinions for the reference of newspapers and leadership departments at all levels. We hope that leadership organs at all levels will give sufficient attention to this issue, so that our leading comrades at all levels understand the importance of newspapers. In September 1901, Stalin wrote in an editorial in the newspaper "Struggle": "The most important responsibility of a newspaper is to be as close as possible to the working masses, to influence them as often as possible, and to be the center of their conscious leadership." In another article, Comrade Stalin said: "...The press - this is the most powerful weapon. With its help, the Party speaks to the working class every day and every hour in the language needed by the Party." If we measure our current situation against this passage, our cadres neither read newspapers nor take responsibility for introducing newspapers to workers, peasants, and other classes of the masses. Then it is worth studying what role our newspapers are playing. At present, the task of working in the new areas is heavy, the institutions are unsound, and the cadres' cultural level is low, which is indeed the case. But not even having time to read the newspaper is not a frequent occurrence. Generally speaking, most of the cadres at the district level, at least the key responsible cadres, are literate enough to read the newspaper. The problem is that they do not have enough understanding of the importance of newspapers and have not developed the habit of learning.

　　How to speed up the distribution of newspapers and maintain the timeliness of the news should also be studied and improved. The People's Daily arrives in Hankou three days later than in Beijing; it often arrives in counties about 200 kilometers away from Hankou about seven to ten days later. Even provincial newspapers have to arrive five to seven days later, and newspapers arrive in districts and townships two or three days later. If the organization is better, it can be accelerated by a few days.

　　As for financial constraints, although it is a fact, as long as you pay attention to saving, you can squeeze out some money to subscribe to newspapers. Higher-level governments should clearly delineate newspaper expenses in the regulations on financial expenditures. At least the main leading organs at the county level should have a copy of the People's Daily.

　　Finally, we feel that local news from North China occupies more space in the People's Daily, while news from other Greater Administrative Areas and provinces is less, which should also be improved.

　　*Editor's Note:* The situation reflected by the Central South Spring Plowing Inspection Team of the Ministry of Agriculture and its valuable suggestions for improving the situation must be given full attention by leading comrades at all levels and all newspapers (including this newspaper). As the inspection team pointed out, there are two aspects to the reasons for this situation: on the one hand, everyone does not have enough understanding of the role of newspapers and the meaning of "everyone running the newspaper"; on the other hand, the newspapers themselves have shortcomings and cannot well meet the actual needs of cadres and the masses. All relevant parties should continue to work hard to improve this situation. In particular, our newspaper workers should strengthen contact with reality and contact with the masses, strengthen news reporting, regularly investigate and study the distribution and reading of newspapers in various places, and continuously improve all aspects of newspaper work according to the opinions of the majority of readers, so that the newspaper becomes a cultural food loved by cadres and the masses and a powerful weapon for guiding actual life and actual work.

　　We have also noticed the shortcomings of this newspaper pointed out in this letter. We are now trying our best to improve.

### 县区领导干部应该看报  中南区县区领导同志很少看报  农业部春耕检查团提出批评建议

　　县区领导干部应该看报
    中南区县区领导同志很少看报  农业部春耕检查团提出批评建议编者同志：
    我们这次来中南区检查春耕。在和县区领导机关的领导同志们广泛接触中，我们感觉到他们对中央甚至对大行政区以至省的许多极重要的决定、指示，以及许多有指导性的文章，有的印象不深，有很多人干脆不知道。我们于是有意识地考察其原因，发现了许多同志是不看报纸的。人民日报在一个县里多则一份二份，有些县一份都没有。长江日报也很少。省级报纸多一点，但读的人也不多。许多同志，甚至县级主要负责同志，三五天甚至一个礼拜不翻报纸的也很多。他们指导工作主要是依靠会议及上级直接发给他们的文件。这样就限制了他们对其他地区经验的吸收，使他们的知识领域只限于一个小范围内，限制了他们政策原则性的提高，降低了应有的工作效率。为什么他们不看报纸和不订报纸呢？
    （１）普遍的反映是机构不健全，任务太重，时间和精力不够。
    （２）报纸发行得不及时，尤其在乡村，看到的更晚，往往晚了十天到两个礼拜。
    （３）经费困难。既要订省的报纸，又要订大行政区的和中央的报纸。
    （４）文化水平低，看不懂，因此对报纸不感兴趣。
    如何改善这一状况呢？我们提出如下意见，供报纸及各级领导部门的参考。希望各级领导机关对这一问题予以足够的重视，使我们各级领导同志懂得报纸的重要。一九○一年九月，斯大林在《斗争》报的社论中写道：“报纸的最重要的责任——是尽可能接近工人群众，尽可能经常影响他们，作他们自觉的领导的中心。”斯大林同志在另一篇文章里又说：“……报刊——这是最有力的武器。在他的帮助下，党每日每时地用自己的党所需要的语言来同工人阶级讲话。”如果拿这一段话来衡量我们的现实情况，我们的干部既不看报纸，又不负责把报纸介绍给工人农民以及其他阶层的群众。那么我们的报纸究竟发挥了些什么作用是很值得研究的。目前新区工作任务繁重，机构不健全，干部文化水平低，确是事实。但连看报纸的时间都没有，并不是经常的情况。一般区级干部，至少是主要负责干部的文化水平多数是可以读报的。问题是他们对报纸的重要性认识不足，没有养成学习的习惯。
    报纸的发行速度如何加快，保持报纸的新闻性，也应研究与改进。人民日报到汉口，比北京晚三天；到距汉口二百公里左右的县，往往迟到七至十天左右。就是省的报纸，也要迟到五至七天，报纸到区乡又得二三天。如果组织得好一点，是可以加快几天的时间。
    至于经费限制，虽是事实，但只要注意一下节约，也可以挤出一份订报纸的钱来。上级政府规定经费开支制度，应明确划出报费项目来。至少县级的几个主要领导机关要有一份人民日报。
    最后我们感到在人民日报上，华北的地方消息占篇幅较多，其他大行政区及各省的消息较少，亦应设法加以改善。
      中央人民政府农业部中南春耕检查组
        一九五○年五月廿二日
    编者按：农业部中南春耕检查团所反映的情况及其所提改善情况的宝贵意见，各地各级领导同志和各报社（包括本报在内）必须给以充分的重视。正如检查团所指出的，这种情况发生的原因有两方面：一方面是大家对于报纸的作用和“大家办报”的意义认识不够；另一方面是报纸本身有缺点，不能很好满足干部和群众的实际需要。各有关方面应该针对这种情况不断努力改进。尤其是我们报纸工作者更要加强对实际的联系和对群众的联系，加强新闻报道，经常调查研究各地发行情况和读报情况，根据广大读者的意见来不断改进报纸各方面的工作，使报纸成为干部和群众所热爱的文化食粮和指导实际生活和实际工作的有力武器。
    这封信所指出的本报的缺点，我们也已经注意到了。现在我们正尽力改进。
