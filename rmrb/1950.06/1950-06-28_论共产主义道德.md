　　On Communist Morality
    A.J. Zisis
    Translated by Jin Shibo and Wu Fuheng
    Xinhua Bookstore Edition
    This book is divided into four chapters: The first chapter explains that a new morality can only have a solid foundation for full development after the establishment of new social and material conditions. It further points out the superior characteristics of the new morality - "This morality is the morality of all mankind." The second chapter uses the Marxist-Leninist historical view to explain the origin, essence, and development of morality, exposing the class nature of morality. At the same time, it refutes the idealist moral views of the bourgeoisie, which start from "eternal truth" and "human nature." The third chapter makes a severe criticism of bourgeois morality. Finally, the fourth chapter is the focus of the whole book, repeatedly explaining the full picture of communist morality.
    Generally speaking: "The communist moral content of Soviet society... is expressed in the concepts of Soviet patriotism and national friendship, the socialist attitude towards property and labor, new discipline, humanitarianism and revolutionary courage, a cheerful spirit and loyal character." "The meaning of Soviet morality is to capture the savagery in human nature, eradicate the remnants of the old morality, oppose the hypocrisy and deceit of the bourgeoisie with socialist loyalty and honesty; oppose egoism and individualism with collectivism; oppose misanthropy with humanitarianism, and instill socialist principles into the daily customs of the masses - 'Everyone for each, each for everyone'." Next, the author analyzes paragraph by paragraph "love of the motherland, vivid Soviet patriotism" as the root of the new emotions and new morality of the Soviet people; "mass heroism in all areas of life"; "the development of personality" built on the "harmonious combination of individual and public interests"; "a new view of labor" and the new qualities of people that grow from it - "hard work, initiative, creativity, comradely mutual assistance, loyalty and honesty, a sense of dignity"; the true "spirit of humanitarianism" that permeates the lives of the Soviet people; and "the consolidation and development of the family" in Soviet society - "One of the most important public obligations of people in socialist society is the moral responsibility for the family and the education of children," and so on.
    The author explains that "the formation of communist morality is a complex process." It "does not automatically grow out of the socialist mode of production." It is "formed under the guidance and influence of Bolshevik politics." "It is developing and continues to define itself in the struggle against the remnants of the old morality."
    This book is worth reading. Today, although our people's revolutionary war has been victorious militarily and politically, and a new society has emerged from the womb of the old society; but in terms of ideology - especially in the category of morality, due to long-term existence in the old society and long-term reactionary propaganda, there are still vast enemies waiting for us to gradually eliminate them in a planned and step-by-step manner. This book exposes the disguise and shortcomings of the old morality and demonstrates the superior characteristics of the new morality from facts and theory. As a weapon in the ideological struggle in the category of morality, this book will help us learn the new, communist morality of the advanced Soviet people and gradually complete our own "revolution in wisdom, revolution in the thought of the working class."

　　论共产主义道德
    郭地
    Ａ·Ｊ·济思诗著
    金诗伯、吴富恒译
    新华书店版
    本书共分四章：第一章说明了新的道德唯有新的社会生活物质条件建立后才有充分发展的基础。更指出新道德的优越特点——“这个道德是全人类的道德”。第二章用马列主义的历史观说明道德的起源、本质发展等问题，揭露了道德的阶级性。同时驳斥了资产阶级“永恒真理”及“人性”出发的唯心论道德观。第三章对资产阶级道德，作了严厉的批判。最后，第四章是全书重点，反复的说明了共产主义道德的全貌。
    从总的方面说：“苏维埃社会的共产主义道德内容，………表现于苏维埃爱国主义和民族友谊的观念，对于财产，对于劳动的社会主义态度，新的纪律，人道主义和革命勇气，愉快的精神和忠贞的性格。”“苏维埃道德的意义就是捕杀人性中的野蛮性，铲除旧道德的残余，以社会主义的忠诚与信实对抗资产阶级的虚假与伪善；以集体主义对抗利己主义和个人主义；以人道主义对抗嫉恨人类，在群众日常风俗之中灌输社会主义法则——‘大家为每人，每人为大家’。”接着，著者逐段分析了作为苏维埃人民新情感新道德根源的“爱祖国，生动的苏维埃爱国主义”；“在一切生活领域中的群众英雄主义”；从“个人与公共利益的协调结合”上建筑起的“个性的发展”；“对劳动的新观点”以及由此而生长形成的人的新品质——“勤劳、主动性、创造性、同志互助、忠诚老实、尊严之感”；在苏维埃人民生活中浸润着的真正“人道主义的精神”；以及在苏维埃社会中“家庭的巩固与发展”——“社会主义社会的人一个最重要的公共义务就是对于家庭及教养儿童的道德责任”等等。
    作者说明“共产主义道德的形成是一个复杂的过程”。它“不是自动由社会主义生产方式里面生长起来的。”它是“在布尔什维克政治的指导影响之下形成的”。“它在发展着并且继续着在向旧道德残余进行斗争中确定自己。”
    这一本书是值得我们一读的。在今天，虽然我们的人民革命战争在军事上、政治上已经胜利了，一个新的社会从旧社会的胎包里产生；但在思想意识上——尤其在道德的范畴内，由于在旧社会中的长期存在和长久的反动宣传，还有广大敌人等待我们有计划有步骤地去渐次消灭。这本书从事实、从理论，揭露了旧道德的伪装和缺陷，昭示了新道德的优越特点。作为在思想斗争中道德范畴内的武器，这一本书将帮助我们学习先进的苏维埃人民新的、共产主义的道德，去逐渐完成我们自己的“智慧中的革命，工人阶级思想中的革命”。
