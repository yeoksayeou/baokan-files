Xinhua News Agency, Paris: According to TASS, thousands of workers attended a conference held by the French Communist Party's Savoie Provincial Committee in Chambéry on the 4th. The General Secretary of the French Communist Party, Thorez, delivered a long speech at the conference.

　　Thorez pointed out that the reactionaries are strengthening their opposition to the Stockholm Peace Appeal signature campaign because they believe that striking at their atomic bombs is striking at their new war preparations.

　　Thorez further discussed the resolution passed by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly, pointing out that it did not stipulate the prohibition of atomic bombs or the destruction of existing atomic bombs, but only completely prohibited the Soviet Union from continuing to research atomic energy and using it for peaceful purposes. Another resolution passed by the Foreign Affairs Committee stated that the actual prohibition of atomic weapons is only possible within the framework of general disarmament. Thorez pointed out that this is precisely the reason that was put forward during the First World War: "Either have everything, or have nothing." But for us, even limited but effective results are still preferable. Thorez asked them: Since they hope for general disarmament, why don't they respond to the Soviet Union's proposals? Why not end the shipment of American arms and release those peace fighters who oppose the unloading of these weapons in France? Why not accept the proposal to reduce military spending? Thorez said: I declare that those who voted in favor of the foreign affairs resolution are in fact accomplices of the warmongers and must be condemned in the same way as the warmongers.

　　Finally, Thorez called for intensifying the signature campaign for the Stockholm Appeal.

　　多列士演说斥战贩的同谋者
    号召人民加紧进行和平签名
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：数千劳动人民参加了法国共产党萨瓦省省委会四日在尚贝里召开的大会。法共总书记多列士曾在会上发表长篇演说。
    多列士指出：反动派正加强反对斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的签名运动，因为他们相信对于他们的原子弹的打击，就是对于他们的新战争准备工作的打击。
    多列士进一步讲到法国国民议会外交委员会所通过的决议，指出它并未规定禁止原子弹或销毁现存的原子弹，而只是完全禁止苏联继续研究原子能和把它用于和平目的。外交委员会通过的另一决议说：实际禁止原子武器，惟有在普遍裁军的体制内才有可能。多列士指出，这正是第一次世界大战时就已提出的理由：“要就是什么都要，要就是什么也不要。”但对于我们，即使是有限的然而是有效的结果，也还是宁愿要的。多列士质问他们：既是希望普遍裁军，为什么不回答苏联的建议？为什么不结束美国军火的运交和释放那些反对在法国起卸这些武器的和平战士？为什么不接受削减军费的建议？多列士说：我宣布那些投票赞成外交决议案的人们事实上是战贩的同谋者，并必须和战贩们一样判罪。
    最后，多列士号召加紧进行征集斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名运动。
