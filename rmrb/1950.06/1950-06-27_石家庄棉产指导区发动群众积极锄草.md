    Shijiazhuang Cotton Production Guidance Area Mobilizes the Masses to Actively Weed
    In order to eradicate cotton aphids and prevent them from spreading and causing disaster, the Shijiazhuang Cotton Production Guidance Area has mobilized district and village cadres, activists, and local primary school students to weed during their spare time, and has achieved considerable results. As of May 26, a total of more than 252,000 jin of weeds have been removed. Cotton farmers also make circle fertilizer while weeding, which not only plays a considerable role in preventing and controlling cotton aphids, but also increases fertilizer. In the Nangong Liang Cotton Area, under the mobilization of the Xingtai Cotton Production Guidance Area, women and children in various villages have also organized themselves and universally launched a weeding campaign. Each village can weed more than 700 jin per day. In less than ten days, the weeds on the roadsides and field ridges have been completely removed, and a lot of green grass has been dried, solving part of the cattle feed problem. (Xu Xiaoquan)

　　石家庄棉产指导区发动群众积极锄草
    为了根除棉蚜，不使蔓延成灾，石家庄棉产指导区发动区村干部、积极分子和当地小学学生利用课余时间进行除草，已获得不少成绩。截至五月二十六日止，共计除草二十五万二千余斤。棉农并随锄随作圈肥，不但对防治棉蚜起了相当作用，还增加了肥料。南宫良棉区，在邢台棉产指导区的发动下，各村妇女、儿童已亦组织起来，普遍展开了拔草运动。各村每日拔草可达七百余斤，不到十天，已把路边地埂的杂草完全拔净，并晒了许多青草，解决了牛的一部分饲料。      （许小泉）
