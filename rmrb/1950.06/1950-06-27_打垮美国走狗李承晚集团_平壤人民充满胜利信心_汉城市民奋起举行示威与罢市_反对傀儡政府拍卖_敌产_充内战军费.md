This morning, the bulletin boards on the streets were crowded with people, eager to see the first victory report released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Before eight o'clock, many people were waiting near the radios and amplifiers on main roads and in front of various government offices to listen to the broadcast speech of the Korean people's leader, General Kim Il-sung. The victory report of the People's Army and the Security Forces launching a large-scale counter-offensive, and General Kim Il-sung's battle call, further strengthened the Korean people's desire for national reunification and independence, and increased their confidence in victory. After listening to their leader's broadcast speech, people excitedly said to each other: "Let's go to Seoul!"
　　Worker Huang Yunji of the Pyongyang Grain Production Factory said: "The Syngman Rhee bandit gang's adventurous offensive of so-called 'Northern Expedition' can only accelerate their own demise.

　　Farmer Wu Henglong from Sincheon County, Gasan District, Hwanghae Province, said: "For five years, under the instructions of American imperialism, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang has been preparing to carry out the so-called 'Northern Expedition'. In order to realize the reunification and independence of the motherland, the Korean people must smash the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's adventurous invasion."
