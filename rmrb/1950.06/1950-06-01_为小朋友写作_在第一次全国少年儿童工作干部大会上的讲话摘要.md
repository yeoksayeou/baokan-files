　　Indeed, children's work is a very important undertaking, a foundation for both nurturing people and building the nation. The most essential factor in building a new country and a new society is the human factor. Today's children are the builders of tomorrow's New Democratic society, socialist society, and even communist society. If we want today's children to truly shoulder the responsibilities of future masters of the country, we must intensify our work with them during their childhood. We must cultivate in our beloved children correct thinking—including a revolutionary outlook on life, noble sentiments—including the spirit of the Five Loves (love of the motherland, love of the people, love of labor, love of science, and love of public property), healthy bodies, and broad and refined knowledge and skills in all areas. We must cultivate our beloved children in every aspect. In this way, when they grow up, they will be able to truly shoulder the lofty task of building a New Democratic society, and even socialist and communist societies.

　　Every person has great plasticity in childhood, like a lump of clay, which can be shaped into whatever one wants. Childhood is the springtime of life, and we should seize the spring to sow seeds and strengthen children's work. People are roughly the same in their natural endowments, that is, roughly equal in intelligence. The main thing depends on nurturing after birth, especially the childcare and education work in childhood, which is very important. Therefore, children's work is very important, and friends who do this work must have a spirit of complete dedication to children's work in order to do this work well.

　　Children's work is multifaceted, such as healthcare, education, and organization, all of which require great efforts to promote. Here, I will only bring up one aspect to promote the attention of the comrades present, and through you, promote the attention of the general comrades. This work is to strive for literary and artistic creation for children.

　　Literary and artistic creation is very important, it can assist children's work in all aspects and help increase children's knowledge. In today's China, there are very few literary workers engaged in children's work, and therefore there are very few children's literature works. Children can be said to be in a state of hunger and semi-hunger in terms of spiritual food. Whether it is nursery rhymes, fairy tales, stories, novels, music, paintings, movies, dramas, dances, or toys, they are all pitifully scarce. Even among these few works, there are still many problems (such as the "picture books" popular on the market). As the saying goes, "A hungry man is not particular about his food," and the same is true for spiritual food. When children's reading materials are very scarce, overly strict measures cannot be taken against bad works, unless the problem is extremely serious. It's like eating bark and grass roots when material food is not enough. Although this is unsanitary and lacks nutrition, it is better than starving to death. Therefore, today our writers or children's workers must create more good literary and artistic works for children, so as to eliminate those bad works in a situation of survival of the fittest and relieve the spiritual hunger of children. Today, we have put forward the slogan "No one should be allowed to starve to death" in terms of material food. The same is true in children's work. We must put forward that no child should be allowed to "starve to death" spiritually. We must strive to cultivate in them correct thinking and noble sentiments. I feel that literary and artistic creation for children is very important. We must pay attention to extensive mobilization and appeals, so that literary workers know the importance of children's literature and create more works of this kind. This kind of work has a great educational effect and a great contribution to children.

　　On the other hand, the large-scale creation of literary and artistic works for children by a large number of literary workers is also a great transformation for literature and art itself. In the past, many writers wrote articles for a small number of people, with the idea of ​​"hiding them in famous mountains and passing them on to their people." The reason why there are so few children's books is also this reason. This is wrong. Truly good literature and art is literature and art that everyone can understand. Literature and art must be popular, not pedantic. Engaging in children's literature and art is to target the vast number of children, so that they can understand it, or at least be able to understand it. This is a major transformation for literature and art itself. Chairman Mao said that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants and soldiers. If our works can be aimed at children, they will inevitably be welcomed by the workers, peasants and soldiers.

　　This will also contribute to the reform of writing. Writing reform is a problem that is very worthy of our consideration at present. Hu Qiaomu, Director of the News Administration, said in his speech at the National News Work Conference that there are 175 newspapers in China, with a daily circulation of 2.45 million copies. Looking at the numbers, it seems that there are many, but compared with the national population of 475 million, it is pitifully small. In the Soviet Union, the Pravda alone has a daily circulation of more than 2 million copies. Among the 175 newspapers in the country, there are newspapers of ethnic minorities, such as newspapers published in their own language by the Uyghur ethnic group, with a daily circulation of 50,000 copies; newspapers published in Korean in the Northeast also have a daily circulation of 40,000 copies. However, the People's Daily, the capital's leading newspaper, has a daily circulation of only more than 90,000 copies. This illustrates a big problem: illiteracy is high and writing is difficult. The issue of writing reform is indeed very important, and everyone needs to study how to carry out the reform; but if we reward literary and artistic creation for children, it will make a good contribution to writing reform. Because the primary condition for writing reform is to make literary and artistic works colloquial and reduce many difficulties in phoneticization of writing; and works for children must also do this in order to be effective.

　　The above are some of the things I thought of today. I hope that everyone can work hard, mobilize, pay attention to and practice this work. This will surely greatly promote children's work.

　　为小朋友写作
    ——在第一次全国少年儿童工作干部大会上的讲话摘要
    郭沫若
    少年儿童工作的确是一项很重要的工作，这是树人也是建国的基础工作。建设新国家新社会最主要的因素是人的因素，今天的少年儿童就是明天的新民主主义社会、社会主义社会乃至共产主义社会的建设者，我们要使今天的少年儿童能真正担负起未来的国家主人翁的责任，一定要在他们的少年儿童时代加紧对于他们的工作，一定要培养我们可爱的少年儿童具有正确的思想——包含着革命的人生观，高尚的情操——包含着五爱精神（爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学与爱护公共财物），有健康的身体，广博而又精细的各方面的智识与各种技能。我们要从各方面培植我们可爱的少年儿童。这样，他们长大时就能够真正担负起新民主主义社会乃至社会主义、共产主义社会建设的崇高任务。
    每一个人在少年儿童时代都有很大的可塑性，像一团粘土似的，要想塑成什么样就可塑成什么样。人的少年儿童时代是人的春天，我们应在春天抢着播种，加强少年儿童工作。人们在自然秉赋上是大致相同的，即在智慧上是大致平等的，主要要看后天的栽培，特别是少年儿童时期的保教工作关系甚大。所以少年儿童工作很重要，做这种工作的朋友，必需要有完全献身于儿童工作的精神，才能把这工作做好。
    少年儿童工作是多方面的，如保健、教育、组织等，都需要费很大的力量来推进。这里，我只提出其中一项来促进在座各位工作同志的注意，并由各位同志去促进一般同志的注意，这项工作就是要为少年儿童文艺创作而努力。
    文艺创作这工作很重要，可辅助少年儿童各方面的工作，帮助增进儿童知识。在今天的中国，文艺工作者，从事于少年儿童工作的很少，因此少年儿童文学作品也很少。少年儿童在精神食粮方面可以说是处在饥饿与半饥饿状态中。不论儿歌、童话、故事、小说、音乐、绘画、电影、戏剧、舞蹈、玩具都是少得可怜。就在这些很少作品当中，也还有着不少问题（如市场上流行的“小人书”）。俗语说：“饥不择食”，精神食粮也是这样。在少年儿童读物很缺乏的时候，对不良作品就不能采取过严的办法，除非问题极大的才取缔。就像物质食粮不够时吃树皮草根一样，虽然这是不卫生的，缺乏营养，但总比饿死好些。所以今天我们作家们或是少年儿童工作者必需多多创作以少年儿童为对象的好的文学艺术作品，以优胜劣败的形势来淘汰那些不良的作品，解救少年儿童精神上的饥饿。今天，我们在物质食粮上已提出“不准让一个灾民饿死”的口号，在少年儿童工作上也一样，要提出不准让一个少年儿童在精神上“饿死”，我们要努力培养他们有正确的思想与高尚的情操。我感觉着少年儿童文艺创作是非常重要的，我们必需注意广泛动员与呼吁，使文艺工作者知道少年儿童文学的重要，多创作这一类的作品，这种作品对于少年儿童有很大的教育作用，很大的贡献。
    另一方面，大批从事文艺工作的同志创作少年儿童文艺作品，对文艺本身来讲，也就是很大的改造。很多作家过去写文章以少数人为对象，有“藏诸名山，传诸其人”的想法。少年儿童读物所以少也就是这个原因。这是错误的，真正好的文艺是人人能懂的文艺。文艺必须大众化，不能咬文嚼字。从事少年儿童文艺是要以广大少年儿童为对象，要他们能看得懂，至少也要能听得懂。这对于文艺本身是一个大改造。毛主席说文艺应为工农兵服务，我们的作品如能以少年儿童为对象，也必然会得到工农兵的欢迎。
    这对于文字改革来讲也会有贡献。文字改革是当前很值得我们考虑的一个问题。新闻总署胡乔木署长在全国新闻工作会议上的讲话时曾说到全中国报纸有一百七十五种，每天销路二百四十五万份。看数字似乎很多，但和全国四万万七千五百万人口比较起来，就觉少得可怜了。在苏联，只是真理报一天就销二百多万份。在全国一百七十五种报纸中有少数民族的报纸，如维吾尔民族用自己的文字出版的报纸，每天销五万份；东北的朝鲜文字出版的报纸每天也销四万份。而首都占全国领导地位的人民日报每日只销九万余份。这说明了很大的一个问题：文盲多，文字困难。文字改革的问题确实很重要，如何进行改革要大家研究；但是我们如果奖励少年儿童文艺创作，对文字改革会有很好的贡献。因文字改革的首要条件是使文艺作品口语化，减少文字拼音化的很多困难；而以少年儿童为对象的作品也必需这样做才能收效。
    以上是我今天想到的一些，希望大家能够努力、动员、注意和实践这个工作。这一定会对少年儿童工作有很大的促进。
