    Guangdong Native Produce Company Purchases One Million Catties of Cassia Bark
    [This newspaper dispatch] The state-owned Guangdong Native Produce Company sent personnel to Luobu, Luoding, and Guangning in the Xijiang area in April to purchase a total of one million catties of cassia bark. Approximately one thousand farmers came to the purchasing stations to sell cassia bark. The income from selling cassia bark was not only sufficient for the farmers' food needs but also provided them with surplus grain to pay public grain. According to the purchase and sales plan formulated at the Native Produce Conference in mid-May, the total amount of funds to be used for purchasing native produce from June to December throughout the province is equivalent to 75 million catties of rice.

    广东土产公司收购桂皮百万市斤
    【本报讯】国营土产公司广东省公司于四月份曾派员到西江区的禄步、罗定、广宁收购桂皮共一百万市斤。到收购站出售桂皮的农民达一千人左右，农民仅出售桂皮所得，不特足供食用，还有余米缴纳公粮。全省按照五月中旬土产会议制订的购销计划，六月到十二月，规定将用以收购土产之总金额即折合大米七千五百万斤。
