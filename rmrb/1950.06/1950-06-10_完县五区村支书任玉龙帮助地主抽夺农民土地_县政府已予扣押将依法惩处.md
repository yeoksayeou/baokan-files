　　Ren Yulong, Village Party Secretary of the Fifth District of Wan County, Helps Landlords Extract Land from Peasants; County Government Has Detained Him and Will Punish Him According to Law
    Ren Yulong, the Communist Party branch secretary of Dongzhao Village, Fifth District, Wan County, Hebei Province, lost his class stance and actually helped the landlord Wang Laoxiu (his uncle) extract more than 30 mu of land from liberated peasants.
    In 1947, when land reform was carried out, Wang Laoxiu's whole family left the village. On December 23 last year, he came back to find Ren Yulong. Ren Yulong comforted him and said: "I have kept three mu of garden and eight mu of land for you, so your life will not be a problem." Ren Yulong also told Wang Laoxiu who had been allocated Wang Laoxiu's land during the land reform. That evening, Ren Yulong invited seven people to his home, including village chief Guo Qingyun, deputy village chief Liu Guanbao, farmers' association director Ren Changlai, civil affairs director Ren Laoxin, branch organization member Liu Guanyi, and branch propaganda member Ren Shuhe, for a lavish meal. At that time, Wang Laoxiu said to them: "Please bother everyone a little!" Ren Yulong said: "My uncle has returned from outside and is having a hard time. Let's discuss giving him some land." Then, he took out the prepared land extraction list and read it aloud. Land certificates had already been issued in the village, so land could not be extracted. However, other cadres were afraid of Ren Yulong and dared not object. Therefore, it was decided to change the land certificates and take back 35.2 mu of land from 18 households, including Ren Laohai, Ren Dakui, Wang Laotai, and Zhang Zhizhong, for Wang Laoxiu to cultivate. On December 27, Ren Yulong also took the village chief and others to threaten the households whose land had been taken away, forbidding them from telling anyone. As a result, the masses in the village were very angry and said: "He (referring to Wang Laoxiu) is still capable! With a good relative (referring to Ren Yulong), anything can be done!" Everyone felt that their land was not guaranteed, and their enthusiasm for production was greatly reduced.
    On May 12 this year, the CCP District Committee learned about this matter and immediately reported it to the County Committee and County Government. Now the government has detained Ren Yulong and will give him the punishment he deserves according to law. The government also sent people to the village to announce to the masses that Ren Yulong's land extraction was illegal, and explained that the government guarantees the land rights determined after the land reform. The masses' enthusiasm for production has stabilized again.

　　完县五区村支书任玉龙帮助地主抽夺农民土地
    县政府已予扣押将依法惩处
    河北省完县五区东赵家庄村中共支部书记任玉龙，失掉阶级立场，竟帮助地主王老秀（他的姑父）向翻身农民抽夺土地三十多亩。
    一九四七年土地改革时，王老秀全家离开了本乡。去年十二月二十三日，他回来找任玉龙。任玉龙安慰他说：“给你留着三亩园子、八亩地，你的生活不成问题。”任玉龙又把土地改革时分了王老秀土地的人告诉王老秀。当天晚上，任玉龙请村长郭庆云、副村长刘贯保、农会主任任常来、民政主任任老信、支部组织委员刘贯一、支部宣传委员任树合等七人到他家来，请他们大吃大喝一顿。当时王老秀对他们说：“请大伙儿费点心哟！”任玉龙说：“我姑父从外边回来了，生活很困难。咱们商量一下，给他抽些地。”接着，他就把事先预备好的抽地单子拿出来念了一遍。该村土地证早已发过了，不能抽地了。但别的干部都怕任玉龙，不敢反对。于是决定变更土地证，抽回任老海、任大奎、王老太、张致中等十八户土地三十五亩二分，给王老秀耕种。任玉龙并在十二月二十七日带了村长等人去威胁被抽了土地的人家，不许他们向外说。于是该村群众非常愤怒，说：“还是人家（指王老秀）行喽！有个好亲戚（指任玉龙），什么也好办！”大家都感到土地没有保障，生产情绪大为降低。
    今年五月十二日，中共区委知道了这件事，便立刻报告县委和县政府。现在政府已经把任玉龙扣起来，将依法给以应得处分。政府还派人到该村向群众宣布，任玉龙抽地的行为是非法的；并说明政府保障土地改革后所确定的土地权。群众的生产情绪又稳定下来了。
