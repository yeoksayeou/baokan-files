On Fifty Kinds of Comic Books

　　Chong Wen

　　To put the mass art form of comic books, loved by the broad masses of children and working people, into the hands of progressive literary and art workers, and to use it as a powerful weapon to improve the cultural life of the masses, is an urgent task in current literary and art activities. This work is now underway and shows a very vigorous atmosphere. For example, in Shanghai, where various conditions are relatively complete, about 200 new comic books have been published in the past six months or so. These new paintings have basically cleared away the feudal, superstitious, decadent, and utopian toxins of the old comic books and have begun to absorb active and combative themes, reflecting the lives and struggles of the masses to some extent; they have played a progressive role in mass literary and art education in today's old comic books, which still have a solid foundation. This work is worthy of praise. However, in order to do the work better, criticism and discussion are also necessary. Recently, I read fifty kinds of comic books, and here I will write down my opinions on these books:

　　These fifty kinds of comic books are published by eight publishing houses, and there are twenty-nine authors (another one is a collective creation by fourteen people). Except for a few that were movie photos published in 1949, the rest were published this year. Generally speaking, the themes of these comic books can be said to be mostly good. But in terms of technique, there are still many shortcomings in these fifty kinds of comic books. Some of these shortcomings are individual, some are quite common; some are just not well expressed, while some seriously affect the content. Let me talk about this aspect first.

　　What are some of these shortcomings?

　　First, the pictures are rough, the characters are inconsistent, and some even tend to be caricatured. For example, using the freehand style of Chinese painting, the style of caricature, or the rough lines of woodcuts, to draw a person with a big head and a small body, or a person taller than a house, or a house bigger than a mountain, etc., is not very appropriate. Some characters' clothes and faces are reversed (such as Yan Liu and Li Laosi in the middle of "The Story of Liu Hulan" - Huadong Bookstore edition); the national flag is painted as a black patch. This is also careless.

　　Second, the coherence is not enough, and there is a lack of action process. For example, there is a "White-Haired Girl" with only eighty pages in total, each page marked with four lines of lyrics, and almost every line of lyrics explains one thing. The picture here is only an illustration of the lyrics; and the four lines of lyrics are bound to be limited, and cannot fully express the meaning, so each group of lyrics seems to be incoherent. Others, such as "Rabbit and Cat" (Education Publishing House) and "The Biography of Three Heroes" (Worker Publishing House), have the same shortcomings. Because there are too few pictures, it is bound to be impossible to properly express the process, so the story is not full enough.

　　Third, the characters are not distinguished between the host and the guest, and the protagonist is not prominent. This is even more serious in ancient costume paintings. Readers only see a variety of ancient costume characters, quaint houses and objects, and cannot distinguish between the host and the guest, or between good and bad. The main characters in each scene also lack relatively prominent shots, and there are no appropriate expressions.

　　Fourth, the layout is not neat, and the words and pictures are inserted in a mess. Some comic books, the pictures are already rough enough, coupled with the uneven size of the description and dialogue fonts, the ugly shapes of the characters, and the lack of attention to the placement, sometimes up and down, sometimes left and right; these technical problems will also make readers feel disgusted.

　　Fifth, the presentation method (arrangement, text) is only suitable for the tastes of adult intellectuals, and is not easily accepted by the target audience of comic books. For example, "Lu Xun's Childhood" (Education Publishing House), in terms of content, is adapted from Lu Xun's original works, so there is naturally no problem (whether it is necessary to choose this theme at present is another matter), and the form is also quite beautiful, the layout is neat, and the illustrations are meticulous, which are all good aspects. However, its description is literary and entirely excerpted from Lu Xun's original text. The preface to the original book says it is for children, but it is very questionable whether children can understand it. In addition, some comic books have mixed a lot of classical Chinese or new terms in most of the wording and descriptions, which should be noted.

　　Sixth, the theme is not clear, or the expression method is not appropriate. For example, in terms of subjective intentions, the original intention was to oppose superstition, but because the material was not grasped at the center, or there was no well-organized development, the readers were instead attracted by some magical and strange, or interspersed materials. In this way, not only is the theme weakened, but even the opposite effect is achieved. For example, in "The Story of Superstition" (Education Publishing House), Cuiying's sanity was cleared after being tried by the false Bao Gong due to mental disorder. Doesn't this seem to show that superstition is good? For example, "Borrowing the Red Lantern" (Education Publishing House), the original intention seems to be to expose the depraved and evil deeds of the children of officials in the feudal era and the darkness of the officialdom, but because the editors and painters' thoughts are chaotic, and there are thick remnants of feudal literature of talented scholars and beautiful women, stealing fragrance and jade, it has become a hodgepodge. As a result, a ruler's Taishi was written as a just old man, which is very bad.

　　Seventh, the expression of heroic figures lacks overall thinking, lacks a mass viewpoint, is too prominent, and flows into individual heroism. For example, "Qiu Jin" (Education Publishing House), this book begins by emphasizing how smart Qiu Jin is, how capable she is, how good she is at poetry and writing, and calls herself Jianhu Female Knight; then a series of "heroic" scenes appear: discussing state affairs under the lamp, teaching the teacher, abandoning her family to go to Japan, a farewell at Taoranting, dancing with a sword.... However, very little is mentioned about the historical background at that time and the entire revolutionary movement at that time. This separates a Qiu Jin from history and isolates her from the masses. Readers here do not mainly receive the correct education of serving the people, but are instilled with the individual "hero" thought of how to stand above the crowd. Such wrong thinking should be cleared.

　　The above shortcomings and problems, if analyzed, can be said that the first to fifth points are purely technical problems, and the latter two points have already involved ideological issues. But what is more serious in terms of ideological issues is that the selection of topics lacks policy thinking, some cannot cooperate with reality, and even flow into reaction. This is most obvious in the serial movie photos published by Yingyi Publishing House and Yueling Publishing House (both distributed by Meihua Bookstore). They almost only focus on the "business eye", and any movie is compiled into a comic book. Most of these are of no educational significance to readers; some are simply reactionary, such as "The Pink Bomb". The content of this book is about how the Kuomintang did underground work in the Japanese-occupied areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan. It is not necessary to say that the content is unreasonable, and the focus of the work is on the sexual temptation of beauty (of course, this is one of the realities of the Kuomintang's working methods). Just from the story itself, it distorts historical facts. Because in fact, the Kuomintang was not doing underground work in the Japanese-occupied areas, but colluding with Japanese imperialists and exchanging visits with each other.

　　Another example of a lack of policy thinking is "Catching Ghosts". This is adapted from Nasha's original work. The passing the hall, beating people, and digging up the bottom of the wealth in this book all violate the current land reform policy.

　　"The Pink Bomb" and "Catching Ghosts" are the two most inappropriate books in these fifty books. I suggest that the distributors of these two books stop distributing them.

　　The two most recommended comic books in these fifty kinds are "Fugui" and "Heroic Dad".

　　"Heroic Dad" is published by Shanghai Education Publishing House, and is a collective creation by Hongben and other fourteen people. The content depicts Zhang Laohan, a military family member of the Northeast Liberation Army, continuing the road of his son who sacrificed his life for the revolution, and gloriously participating in the ranks of the people's armed forces. The story is moving, making people clearly see the greatness of the Liberation War and the glory of being a soldier of the Liberation Army. The progress of the pictures is lively and delicate, like reading a literary work, and the characters are relatively complete and can maintain their consistency. "Fugui" is published by the People's Bookstore Supply Agency, and is compiled and drawn by Zhao Hongben and Zhou Xingsheng. Its content is roughly consistent with Zhao Shuli's original work, and it can also grasp the spirit of the original work. In addition to having the advantages of "Heroic Dad", it is quite powerful in enlightening class education and exposing feudal crimes. The ingenious design of the drawings and the neatness and cleanliness of the layout are more progressive than "Heroic Dad".

　　In addition to "Fugui" and "Heroic Dad", many of the remaining types also have some advantages, such as the selection of materials for "The Biography of Three Heroes" (published by Workers Publishing House), which can be combined with reality, and the meticulousness of the pictures in "Lu Xun's Childhood" mentioned earlier.

　　Now, for the convenience of readers and to reflect the specific situation of the compilation, drawing and publishing of these comic books, a small statistic has been made, hoping to attract everyone's attention and research.

　　关于五十种小人书
    崇文
    把广大儿童和劳动人民所喜爱的连环图画这个群众文艺形式，掌握到进步文艺工作者的手里，作为提高群众文化生活的有力武器，是当前文艺活动中一个迫切的工作。这一工作现在正在开始，而且显出了非常蓬勃的气象，像各种条件比较完备的上海，半年多来，就出版了约二百种的新连环画。这些新画基本上清扫了旧连环画封建、神怪、颓废、空想等等的毒素，开始吸取了积极的战斗的题材，多少反映了群众的生活与斗争；在旧连环画还有深固基础的今天，在群众文艺教育上起了进步的作用。这种工作是值得受褒扬的。不过为了把工作做得更好，批评和商讨也是必要的。最近我读了五十种小人书，这里就把我对于这些书的意见，写在下面：
    这五十种小人书，由八个出版机关出版，作者共有二十九位（另有一本是十四人的集体创作）。除了少数的几种是一九四九年出版的电影照片外，其余的都是今年出版。一般讲来，这些小人书的主题可以说大多数都是好的。但从技巧上讲，这五十种小人书中，就还有不少缺点。这些缺点，有些是个别的，有些是带有相当普遍性的；有些只是表现得不好，而有些却严重地影响到内容。让我先从这一方面谈谈。
    是些什么缺点呢？
    第一、画面粗糙，人物形象前后不一致，甚至有些流于漫画作风。如用中国画的大写的方式，用漫画的方式，用粗线条的木刻方式，把一个人画得头很大、身子很小，或者人比房子高，房子比山还大等，这些都不大合适。有些人物的衣着面貌前后颠倒（如《刘胡兰的故事》中间的阎六和李老四——华东书店版）；画国旗画成一片黑。这也是不谨慎的。
    第二、连贯性不够，缺乏动作过程。如有一种《白毛女》，总共才八十面，每面标四句唱词，几乎每一句唱词说明一件事情。画面在这里仅仅是唱词的插图；而四句唱词，也就必然受着一定的局限，不能充分表达意思，因而每一组唱词之间，便显得不能连贯。其他如《兔和猫》（教育出版社）《三个英雄传》（工人出版社）等，也有同样缺点。由于画面太少，就必然不能适当地表现过程，因此故事性也就不够充分。
    第三、人物形象宾主不分，主人公显得不突出。这在古装画里犯得更厉害。读者只看到一些各色各样的古装人物、古香古色的房舍和物事，分不清宾主，辨不出好丑。每个场景的主要脚色亦无比较突出的镜头，也没有适当的表情。
    第四、版面不整洁，字与图插得乱七八糟。有些小人书，图画已经够粗糙了，再加上说明与对话的字体写得大小不一、字形难看，以及摆的地方的不考究，忽上忽下，忽左忽右；这些技术上的毛病，也会使读者看了觉得讨厌。
    第五、表现方法（编排、文字）只适合成年的知识分子口味，不易为小人书的对象所接受。譬如《鲁迅的童年》（教育出版社），在内容上是根据鲁迅原著编绘，当然无甚问题（在目前是否一定要选这个题材，那又当别论），在形式上也相当美，版面整洁，绘图工整，这都是好的一面。但它的说明，却是文绉绉的，纯系摘录鲁迅原文。原书的序上说是给儿童们看的，但儿童们是否看得懂？是很成问题的。另外有些小人书，在大部分的用语上和说明上，都参杂了不少的文言或新名词，这都是应该注意的。
    第六、主题思想不明确，或表现手法不适当。比如在主观企图上，原意是在反迷信，但由于处理材料时抓不住中心，或者不能有一个好好组织起来的发展，致使读者们反被一些神奇古怪的、或者穿插的材料所吸引。这样一来，不但削弱了主题思想，甚至还起了相反的作用。如《迷信的故事》（教育出版社）中的翠英因神经错乱被假包公堂审后，神志反而清楚了，这岂不是显得迷信倒有好处了吗？又比如《借红灯》（教育出版社），原意似乎是在暴露封建时代官宦子弟的败德邪行和官场的黑暗，但由于编绘者的思想混乱，存在着浓厚的才子佳人、偷香窃玉的封建文艺的残余思想，所以弄成了四不像。结果将一个统治者的太师写成了个公正的老人，这是很不好的。
    第七、表现英雄人物缺乏整体思想，缺乏群众观点，过于突出，流于个人英雄主义。如《秋瑾》（教育出版社），这书一开始就强调秋瑾如何聪明，如何有能力，能诗能文，自号鉴湖女侠；以后就接连出现一些“英雄”的场面：灯下谈国事、教诲塾师、弃家赴日、陶然亭饯别、舞剑……。但对当时的历史背景、当时的整个革命运动，却很少提到。这样就把一个秋瑾和历史割裂开来，和群众隔离开来。读者在这里主要不是得到正确的为人民服务的教育，而是被灌输了如何能站在众人之上的个人“英雄”思想。这样的错误思想是应该清洗的。
    上面一些缺点和问题，如果加以分析，可以说从第一点至第五点是属于纯技巧的问题，后面两点是已经涉及到思想性的问题。但更严重地涉及思想性的问题还在于：挑选题材缺乏政策思想，有的不能配合现实，甚至流于反动。这在影谊出版社和越伶出版社（均由美华书局担任发行）所出版的连环电影照片，表现得最明显。它们几乎只就“生意眼”着眼，凡电影就编成连环画。这里面多数是对读者毫无教育意义的；有的简直是反动的，如《粉红色的炸弹》。这书内容是写国民党在抗战时期如何在日占区做地下工作，它的内容的不合情理，把工作的重点放在美女的性的诱惑上（当然，这倒是国民党的工作方法的实情之一）等等，且不去说，仅就故事本身说，就是歪曲历史事实的。因为事实上，国民党不是在日占区做地下工作，而是与日本帝国主义者勾结，互相往还。
    缺乏政策思想的又一例子是《捉鬼》。这是根据那沙的原著改编的。这本书中的过大堂，打人，追挖底财等，都是违反当前的土地改革政策的。
    《粉红色的炸弹》《捉鬼》这两本书，是这五十种书中内容最不妥的。我建议这两书的发行者将这两本书停止发行。
    这五十种小人书中最值得推荐的，我以为是《福贵》和《英雄的爸爸》两种。
    《英雄的爸爸》系上海教育出版社出版，宏本等十四人的集体创作。内容为描绘一位东北解放军军属张老汉继续着他儿子为革命立功牺牲的道路，光荣的参加了人民武装的行列。故事动人，使人清楚地看到解放战争的伟大和当解放军战士的光荣。图画的进行，活泼而细腻，如读一篇文艺作品，人物形象较完整，前后能保持其一致性。《福贵》系人民书报供应社出版，赵宏本、周杏生编绘。它的内容与赵树理的原著大体一致，还能抓住原著的精神，除具备有《英雄的爸爸》的优点外，在启发阶级教育、暴露封建罪恶方面颇有力量。画图设计的精巧，版面的整洁、干净，比《英雄的爸爸》更有进步。
    除《福贵》和《英雄的爸爸》以外，其余的许多种也具备着部分优点，如《三个英雄传》（工人出版社出版）之选材，能结合现实，以及前面提到过的《鲁迅的童年》之画面工整等。
    现在为了读者的方便，也为了反映这些小人书编绘出版工作的具体情况，作了一个小统计，希望能引起大家的注意和研究。
