　　Hunan, Hubei, and Henan Provinces Purchase and Export Local Products;
    Wuhan's Local Product Market is Active
    [Reported by this newspaper] Under the correct implementation of foreign trade policies by the Central South Military and Administrative Committee, and the encouragement of local product exports, local product companies in Hunan, Hubei, and Henan have launched the work of purchasing local and special products, invigorating the rural economy and the local product market in Wuhan.
    The Hunan Provincial Native Produce Company, since its establishment in October last year, initially had a small business scope, mainly dealing with tea, bristles, and native paper. It successively established factories in Anhua, Xiangtan, Liuyang and other places for processing, so that the tea, bristle, and papermaking industries, which had been devastated and stifled under the Kuomintang reactionary rule, gradually recovered. For example, under the leadership of the papermaking factory established by the company, the Liuyang native paper industry not only enabled most of the suspended households to resume work, but also further improved the quality and stopped making superstitious paper. The paper now produced can be used for printing books, newspapers, and various account books, and sales have increased accordingly. Since the end of March this year, the company's business has gradually expanded, with the establishment of a Changsha business department and six branch companies in Xiangtan, Hengyang, Changde, Shaoyang, Yiyang, and Yongzhou. The types of local products handled have also increased from twelve to thirty-seven. The capital investment has also increased from 127.8 million yuan from October to December last year to more than 16.4 billion yuan from January to May this year. In the purchase of local products, in addition to key purchases, it is combined with production and disaster relief. For example, in April, 500 million yuan was allocated to purchase Liling porcelain. Since May 14, it has purchased 4,000 dan of coarse and fine porcelain from porcelain factories, worth 300 million yuan, maintaining the jobs of more than 6,000 porcelain workers facing unemployment. In May, 90,000 bolts of native cloth were purchased in Changsha, Liuyang, Changde and other places. In order to organize the export of rural sideline products and increase farmers' income, the company has organized the export of more than ten kinds of agricultural and sideline products from October last year to May this year, including: tea, bristles, ramie, gallnuts, duck feathers, cowhide, deerskin, yellow wolf skin, button blanks, peanuts, eggs, firecrackers, rosin, etc. The company also assists and encourages private export manufacturers to purchase gallnuts, duck feathers, ramie and other materials with better foreign sales at reasonable prices. For example, the ramie company purchased more than 800,000 catties, which is less than half of what private merchants purchased. Private merchants purchased 80% of the total amount of duck feathers.
    The Xiangfan Special District Trading Company in Hubei Province also vigorously purchased local and special products. In the 20 days from April 20 to May 9, the Fancheng store of the company alone purchased more than 28.8 million catties of medicinal materials such as eucommia, cassia bark, codonopsis, pinellia, and cyperus, more than 1,250 bolts of native cloth, and more than 400 catties of bristles. By the end of April, the trade stores in Gucheng, Hekou, Wuzhen, and Baokang had also purchased more than 37,000 catties of tung oil, more than 5,700 catties of fungus, more than 800 bolts of native cloth, and more than 2,000 catties of medicinal materials.
    From March to May, the Henan Provincial Native Produce Company also purchased a total of 45 million cubic feet of local products in rural areas. The masses can obtain a net profit equivalent to 16.9 million catties of wheat. Calculating 30 catties of wheat per person per month, it can maintain the lives of 560,000 people for one month.
    With the development of local product purchase work in various places, the local product market in Wuhan, the distribution center of local products, has become active. Since mid-March, although prices have generally stabilized and fallen, and general goods have been sluggish, the local product market in Wuhan has been active. Moreover, the transaction volume of various local products has been increasing month by month, and there is a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand. In terms of fur, the transaction volume of cowhide from March 25 to the end of May (two months and five days) reached more than 25,700 dan, which has reached 40% of the average annual transaction volume from 1938 to 1944. In April alone, more than 13,600 dan were traded. In May, due to the busy farming season and the fact that most of the stocks in various places had been shipped out, it decreased slightly, but merchants from Northeast and North China continued to come to purchase. In April, more than 1,600 dan of sheepskin were traded. In May, due to seasonal reasons, the arrival of goods was scarce, and the transaction volume was more than 1,100 dan. In April, more than 700 dan of pig hair were traded, and in May, more than 1,300 dan were traded, an increase of more than 80% compared with April. In April and May, more than 2,000 dan of pig bristles were traded. In May, more than 48,000 pieces of miscellaneous leather were traded, an increase of 29% compared with April. Under the acquisition of the Shanghai Gang, the transaction volume of raw silk in April was more than 55,700 dan, which increased to more than 136,000 dan in May, an increase of 140% compared with April. Both domestic and foreign sales of ramie are smooth, with a transaction volume of more than 5,200 dan in April and May. Gallnuts are sold in large quantities to Guangzhou in the south, and the shortage is most felt. In May, more than 1,800 dan were traded, an increase of 56% compared with April. The transaction volume of brown sugar in April and May was also nearly 20,000 dan. It is now approaching the peak season, and sales are even smoother. The transaction volume of tobacco leaves in April and May was nearly 14,000 dan. From the end of mid-April to mid-May, the transaction volume of tung oil also reached more than 49,000 dan. It can be seen that the purchase and sale of local and special products in various places plays a great role in enlivening the urban and rural economy.

　　湘鄂豫诸省收购土产输出
    武汉土产市场活跃
    【本报讯】在中南区人民政府正确执行对外贸易政策，鼓励土产输出下，湖南、湖北、河南等地土产公司展开了收购土产和特产的工作，活跃了农村经济，也活跃了武汉市的土产市场。
    湖南省土产公司自去年十月成立后，初时业务经营范围较小，主要经营茶叶、猪鬃、土纸三项；并先后在安化、湘潭、浏阳等地设厂加工，使在国民党反动统治下备受摧残和窒息的茶叶、猪鬃、造纸各业逐渐复苏。如浏阳土纸业亦在该公司所设之造纸厂领导下，不但使停工的槽户大部复工，且进一步改造了品质，停制迷信用纸，现在所制的纸已可以印刷书报及各种账簿，销路亦因而增加。到今年三月下旬以后，土产公司业务逐渐扩大，设立了长沙营业部及湘潭、衡阳、常德、邵阳、益阳、永州等六个支公司，经营土产品亦由十二种增加到三十七种。投放资金也从去年十至十二月中的一亿二千七百八十余万元，增加到今年一至五月份的一百六十四亿余元。在收购土产中除重点收购外，并结合生产救灾。如在四月份曾拨款五亿元收购醴陵瓷器，自五月十四日起已向瓷厂收购粗细瓷共四千担，价值三亿元。维持了面临失业的六千多瓷业工人的工作。五月份又在长沙、浏阳、常德等地收购土布九万匹。又该公司为组织农村副业产品外销，增加农民收入，自去年十月至今年五月，组织出口的农副业产品计有：茶叶、猪鬃、苎麻、五倍子、鸭毛、牛皮、麂皮、黄狼皮、钮扣毛胚、花生仁、蛋品、鞭炮、松香等十余种。该公司并协助和鼓励私营出口厂商以合理价格收购五倍子、鸭毛、苎麻等国外销路较好之物资。如苎麻公司收购了八十余万斤，尚不及私商所收的二分之一，鸭毛私商收购的占总收购量百分之八十。
    湖北省襄樊专区贸易公司亦大力收购当地土产、特产，四月二十到五月九日的二十天中，仅该公司樊城门市部就收购杜仲、桂皮、党参、半夏、香附等药材二千八百八十余万斤，土布一千二百五十余匹，猪鬃四百余斤。谷城、河口、武镇、保康四地贸易商店，至四月底止，亦收购了桐油三万七千余斤，木耳五千七百余斤，土布八百余匹，药材二千余斤。
    河南省土产公司，在三至五月份，亦在农村收购土产共四千五百万方尺，群众可获净利折合小麦一千六百九十万斤，每人每月以三十斤小麦计算，可维持五十六万人一个月的生活。
    经过各地收购土产工作的展开，土产集散中心的武汉市，土产市场即形活跃。自三月中旬以来，虽然物价全面稳落，一般货物滞销，但汉市土产市场一直表现活跃。且各项土产成交量逐月上升，并有供不应求的现象。皮毛方面，牛皮自三月二十五日至五月底两个月零五天，其成交量即达二万五千七百余担，已达到一九三八年到一九四四年每年平均成交量的百分之四十，其中仅四月份即成交一万三千六百余担。五月份因正值农忙和各地存货多已运出，故稍减少，但东北、华北客商前往采购者仍源源不绝。羊皮四月份成交一千六百余担，五月份因季节关系来货稀少，成交为一千一百余担。猪毛四月份成交七百余担，五月份成交一千三百余担，比四月份增加百分之八十强。猪鬃四、五两月份成交二千余担。杂皮五月份成交四万八千余张，比四月份增加百分之二十九。生丝在申帮收购下，四月份成交量为五万五千七百余担，五月份增至十三万六千余担，比四月份增加百分之一百四十。苎麻内外销路均畅，四、五两月份成交在五千二百担以上。五倍子大量南销广州，最感缺货，五月份成交一千八百余担，比四月份增加百分之五六。红糖四、五月份成交量亦近二万担，现已临旺季，销路更畅。烟叶四、五两月成交近一万四千担。桐油从四月中旬末到五月中旬的一个月中，成交亦达四万九千余担。足见各地收购运销土产特产后，对于活跃城乡经济是起着很大作用的。
