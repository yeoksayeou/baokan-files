　　Tianjin Bank of China Continues to Support Exports
    Loans Exceed 100 Billion Yuan in May
    [Tianjin News] According to the Tianjin Daily news on June 10th: In order to encourage the export of local products and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the Tianjin Bank of China granted export loans totaling over 100 billion yuan in May. Port loans amounted to 2.47 million US dollars, and urban and rural loans amounted to 86 billion yuan in local currency. A total of 62 purchase certificates were issued throughout the month, totaling 12.3 billion yuan, an increase of 24.79% compared to April; export bills collected on behalf of clients numbered 69, totaling over 4 billion yuan, an increase of more than threefold compared to April. Among these, transactions with the Shanghai Joint Office were the most numerous, with 20 transactions totaling 2.1 billion yuan, accounting for approximately 50% of the total amount collected on behalf of clients.
    The loan recipients were mainly engaged in the export of wool and peanuts, with the former accounting for 37.07% and the latter accounting for 23.69%. Next were peanut kernels, tung oil, and carpets. The focus on wool and peanuts was mainly due to the rising international prices of wool and the peak export season for peanuts.
    [Further News] In order to facilitate the transfer of funds for exporters and implement the policy of low-priced and multi-exchange rates, the Tianjin Bank of China, under the leadership of the People's Bank of China, began interbank remittances with various regions within the customs area in late May. In addition to direct remittances to People's Banks in various regions, remittance relationships have also been established between joint offices, and remittances with the joint offices in Shanghai, Hankou, Hangzhou, and Beijing have already commenced.
    Furthermore, since the bank began interbank remittances with the Kwantung Bank in the Lushun-Dalian area in February of this year, the amount of remittances has been increasing monthly. In May, 86 million Kwantung Yuan were remitted out, an increase of 18 times compared to February; 40 million yuan were remitted in, an increase of slightly more than 12 times compared to February (currently, one Kwantung Yuan is equivalent to 31 yuan in Renminbi).

　　天津中国银行继续扶植出口
    五月份贷款千余亿元
    【天津讯】据六月十日天津日报消息：津市中国银行，为鼓励土产出口，促进城乡物资交流，五月份共叙做出口贷款千余亿元。口岸贷款二百四十七万美元，城乡贷款本币八百六十亿元。全月共开出购买证六十二笔，计一百二十三亿元，较四月份增加百分之二四·七九；代收出口押汇六十九笔，共四十余亿元，较四月份增加三倍以上。其中以上海联行的最多，共二十笔，计二十一亿元，约占代收总额百分之五十。
    出贷对象以经营羊毛绒及花生米出口者为主，前者占百分之三七·○七，后者占百分之二三·六九。其次为子仁、桐油和地毯。羊毛绒和花生米所以成了扶助的重点，主要是由于羊毛绒国外价格趋升，花生米正值出口旺季。
