　　Party Cadres in Streets and Villages of Twenty Suburban Districts of Beijing
    Hold Too Many Meetings and Concurrent Positions, Affecting Production
    The CCP Beijing Suburban Twenty District Committee Has Determined a Solution
    [Reported by this newspaper] The CCP Beijing Suburban Twenty District Committee recently held two symposiums of street and village branch secretaries to examine the leading role of branches and party members in production, the relationship between the branches and various departments, and to study how to improve the correct leadership of the District Committee over the street and village party branches in the future.
    At the meeting, it was found that there are three common problems in various streets and villages: First, village cadres have too many meetings, which affects production. Second, cadres hold too many concurrent positions. Third, village cadres have opinions about the grain subsidies. If the above problems cannot be solved quickly, they will create great resistance to the development of the production movement. Li Deren, the branch secretary of Shang'an Village, said: "I simply can't live like this! In the first half of May, I attended eight meetings in ten days. If this continues, the whole family will wither!" Then he said: "District cadres are provided with living expenses by the state, but our village cadres are not compensated for the time we are taken away from production!" Yang Yuzhen, the branch secretary of Dongxinfang Street in Mentougou, is a blacksmith and serves as the director of the Handicraft Workers' Union, as well as the head of the public security team, the director of the Production Guidance Committee, etc. Because of the many concurrent positions, there are many meetings. Not only is there no production time, but even rest time feels insufficient. As a result, the tasks assigned by the higher authorities are piled up and cannot be completed on time. There have also been biases in the distribution of grain subsidies for village cadres. The Beicun branch took over everything and gave the subsidies to a few people. The village chief of Pingyuan Village ate the subsidy grain alone, causing disunity among party members, cadres, and non-party cadres. Another bias is equal distribution. All cadres, big and small, get a share, and each person gets only a few pounds, which does not solve any difficulties. Due to the above-mentioned biases, active cadres are no longer active, and inactive cadres are even more inactive. The work becomes a matter of pushing once for each step forward, and no movement without pushing.
    Based on the above inspection, the District Committee believes that there are still many areas in its leadership that need to be improved. The main thing is that it does not understand the situation at the lower levels, does not discover problems and solve them in time, and does not summarize experience. At this symposium, it learned about the overall situation and found that the district leaders and various departments had inconsistent ways of handling problems in the past (such as inconsistent answers to questions), and the district cadres also had a coercive style, which urgently needs to be improved. Regarding the three issues of too many meetings, too many concurrent positions, and grain subsidies, the following solutions are decided: First, meetings of the same nature can be combined; unnecessary meetings will not be held. Party group meetings will be held twice a month, branch committee meetings will be held twice a month, and branch general meetings will be held once at the end of each month. Second, the branch secretary and branch committee members of each street and village should generally not hold more than two concurrent positions. This can give play to the core leading role of the party and overcome the past problems of the separation of party and government, the accumulation of work, and the impact on production. Third, the grain subsidies for village cadres must be focused on key subsidies. Cadres who do not receive subsidies should solve their own difficulties from production, and should never become negative or cause disunity because of this. The District Committee also decided to organize a branch work inspection team recently to examine and educate party members and inspect the implementation of work.

　　京郊二十区街、村党员干部
    会议多兼职多影响生产 
    中共京郊二十区区委会已定出解决办法
    【本报讯】中共京郊二十区区委最近先后召开了两次街、村支部书记座谈会，检查支部、党员在生产中的领导作用，支部与各部门间的关系，及研究如何改进今后区委对街、村党支部的正确领导。
    会上，发现目前各街、村普遍存在三个问题：第一、村干部会议多，影响生产。第二、干部兼职多。第三、村干部因补助粮闹意见。上述问题如不能迅速解决，将对开展生产运动发生极大阻力。上岸村支部书记李德仁说：“简直我就没法生活了！五月前半月，十天开了八次会，这样下去，一家人都得干巴起来！”接着又说：“区干部由国家供给生活费用，可是我们村干部耽误生产就不成呀！”门头沟东辛房街支部书记杨玉珍是个铁匠，担任手工业工会主任，兼治安小组长、生产指导委员会主任等。因为兼职多，开会就多。不但没有生产时间，连休息时间也觉得不足。结果上级布置的工作都堆积起来，不能按时完成。村干部补助粮的分配也发生了偏向。北村支部包办代替，将补助粮给了少数人。平原村长一个人吃了补助粮，造成党员干部和非党干部的不团结。另一种偏向是平均分配。大小干部全有一份，每人分不到几斤，什么困难也解决不了。由于发生上述偏向弄得积极的干部也不积极了，不积极的更加不积极。工作形成推一步进一步，不推不动。
    根据以上检查情况，区委认为自己在领导方面尚有不少地方值得改进。主要是不了解下情，没有及时发现问题，解决问题，和总结经验。在这次座谈会上，了解了全面情况，并发现区领导各部门，过去处理问题有不统一（如答复问题不一致）的现象，区干部也有着强迫命令的作风，这些都急待改进。关于开会多，兼职多，补助粮三问题，决定如下解决办法：一、同类性质的会议，可合并召开；不必要的会议不开。党内小组会一个月开两次，支委会一个月开两次，支部大会每月月底召开一次。二、各街、村支部书记及支委，一般兼职不得超过两职。这样可以发挥党的核心领导作用，克服过去党政不分，工作堆积，影响生产等毛病。三、村干部补助粮决定要重点补助。得不到补助的干部，应当从生产中解决自己的困难，决不应因此便工作消极、闹不团结等。区委并决定最近组织支部工作检查组，审查教育党员，检查工作执行情形。
