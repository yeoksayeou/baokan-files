Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: US and Japanese reactionaries are unreasonably suppressing the peace movement carried out by Japanese students. According to a United Press report from Tokyo on the 13th: A Japanese university student who distributed leaflets advocating peace was arrested by the Japanese reactionary authorities on the grounds of "spreading anti-occupation propaganda." At the same time, the police unreasonably prohibited the pre-screening of the film "Listen, the Ocean is Calling!" This is an anti-war film depicting the tragic fate of Japanese students who were drafted into the army during World War II. The film was originally scheduled to be shown on the 13th and 14th at the Kanda Cinema, under the auspices of the progressive "Association to Commemorate Students Who Died in the War."
    Another United Press report stated that three hundred Japanese students gathered outside Shibuya Station in Tokyo to collect signatures for peace.

　　日学生拥护和平运动竟遭美日反动派制止
    “你听，海洋在呼唤”影片预演被禁
    【新华社十五日讯】美、日反动派无理镇压日本学生进行和平运动。据合众社东京十三日讯：一个散发拥护和平的传单的日本大学生，竟被日本反动当局称为“散播反对占领的宣传”而加以逮捕。同时，警察并无理禁止“你听，海洋在呼唤！”影片的预演。这是一张描写日本学生在第二次世界大战期间被征入伍后的悲惨命运的反战影片。该片在进步的“纪念战时死难学生协会”的主持下，原订于十三及十四两日在神田电影院放映。
    另据合众社称：三百名日本学生曾集合于东京涩谷车站之外，征集和平签名。
