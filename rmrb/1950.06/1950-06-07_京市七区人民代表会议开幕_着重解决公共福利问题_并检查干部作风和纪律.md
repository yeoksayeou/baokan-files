[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The People's Representative Conference of the Seventh District of Beijing Municipality opened at 2:00 PM on June 6th. Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of Beijing Municipality, attended the meeting to provide guidance. On behalf of the Municipal Government, he delivered a speech on the two main issues to be discussed at the conference: inspecting cadre conduct and resolving residents' welfare and health problems. The conference also heard work reports from the Seventh District Government Office and the Third Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau.

After the conference adopted the list of the presidium, Song Ruifen, chairman of the presidium and secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Seventh District, delivered the opening speech. Song Ruifen pointed out that, based on the opinions of residents from all walks of life, this conference will focus on solving public welfare issues and inspecting cadre conduct and discipline. He also pointed out that the conference will be conducted under the principles of simplicity, frugality, time-saving, and efficiency.

Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu's Speech: Inspect Cadre Conduct and Discipline, Rely on the Broad Masses of Citizens to Offer Opinions

Subsequently, Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of Beijing Municipality, took the stage amidst warm applause to deliver a speech. Regarding the issue of inspecting cadre conduct, Deputy Mayor Zhang pointed out that, in order to enable government personnel to better serve the people, the Municipal Government has decided to launch a city-wide campaign to inspect cadre conduct. To successfully complete this task, it is essential to rely on the broad masses of citizens to offer opinions and criticisms. The education and reform of cadres with poor conduct must also rely on the assistance and supervision of the people. The People's Representative Conference of the District is an important venue for assisting the government in carrying out this task. It is hoped that all representatives and the broad masses of residents will, in the spirit of "those who speak are not to be blamed, and those who hear should take warning" and "know everything and say everything," earnestly, responsibly, and realistically offer criticisms of cadre work style and government work. The scope of criticism is not limited to the district government; the municipal government can also be criticized. The People's Government will never allow cadres to take retaliatory actions against the masses because of being criticized. Everyone can rest assured. Regarding public welfare issues, Deputy Mayor Zhang said that the Seventh District is a district where working people live in large numbers. In the past, reactionary rulers such as the Kuomintang and the Northern Warlords completely ignored the public welfare of this area. Therefore, for the Seventh District, improving the public welfare of citizens is an important task at present. In the last Municipal People's Representative Conference, the municipal construction policy and specific work plans of giving priority to the welfare of working people have been determined. However, there may still be some work that must be done and can be done that the government has not thought of, and it is hoped that everyone will try their best to bring them up. How to handle them according to the specific conditions in the district, distinguishing between the important and the less important, the urgent and the less urgent, has become an important issue to be resolved at this conference.

District Head Han Linguang's Report: Improve the Environmental Sanitation of the Seventh District, Strengthen the Leadership of Production Work

Han Linguang, Head of the Seventh District, gave a detailed report on the work of the Seventh District Government Office in various aspects such as political power construction, municipal sanitation, culture and education, production, and social relief over the past year. Regarding the future work policy and plan, he pointed out that, in addition to further consolidating the revolutionary order, it is necessary to improve the environmental sanitation of the Seventh District in a focused and appropriate manner, strengthen the leadership of production work, develop social education, strengthen the leadership of primary schools, and appropriately solve the problem of education for some out-of-school children. Mu Fu, Director of the Third Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, reported on the public security work in the past year. He asked the representatives to mobilize the broad masses to assist the government in eliminating bandits and special agents. Han Linguang and Mu Fu both emphasized in their reports that inspecting cadre conduct and discipline is a very important task, and they hoped that everyone could offer as much criticism as possible so that the work of the Seventh District could be done better in the future.

Yesterday, among the guests were Li Leguang, representative of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Weng Shiwu, representative of various democratic parties in Beijing, Weng Dujian, Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, and Liu Junying, representative of the Municipal Women's Federation, who successively addressed and congratulated the conference.

　　京市七区人民代表会议开幕
    着重解决公共福利问题  并检查干部作风和纪律
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市第七区各界人民代表会议六日下午二时开幕。北京市人民政府副市长张友渔到会指导；并代表市政府，就这次会议所要讨论的两个主要问题——检查干部作风和解决居民福利卫生问题发表演说。昨日会议并听取了第七区区公所和公安局外三分局的工作报告。
    会议通过主席团名单后，由主席团主席、中国共产党北京市第七区委员会书记宋汝棼致开幕词。宋汝棼指出：根据各界居民的意见，这次会议，将着重解决公共福利问题，并检查干部作风和纪律。他又指出：会议将在简单、朴素、省时、省事的原则下进行。
    张友渔副市长致词  检查干部作风和纪律  依靠广大市民提意见
    接着，北京市人民政府副市长张友渔在热烈的掌声中登台致词。关于检查干部作风问题，张副市长指出：为了使政府工作人员更好地为人民服务，市政府已经决定在全市范围内展开检查干部作风的工作。要很好的完成这项工作，主要是依靠广大市民提出意见，提出批评。对于作风不良的干部的教育和改造，也要依靠人民的协助与监督。区各界人民代表会议正是协助政府进行这项工作的重要场所，希望各位代表和广大居民，本着“言者无罪，闻者足戒”和“知无不言，言无不尽”的精神，认真、负责、实事求是地对干部工作作风和政府工作踊跃提出批评。批评的范围也不限于区政府，对市政府也同样可以批评。人民政府绝不容许干部因被批评而向群众采取报复行为。大家可以放心。关于公共福利问题，张副市长说：第七区是劳动人民集居的地区，过去国民党以至北洋军阀等反动统治者，对这个地区的公共福利是完全漠视不管的。因此就七区来说，改进市民的公共福利是当前的一项重要工作。在上次市各界人民代表会议中已确定了首先照顾劳动人民福利的市政建设方针和具体工作计划。但是，可能还有一些必须做而又能做到的工作，政府没有想到，希望大家尽量提出来。如何就区内的具体情况，分别轻、重、缓、急，加以办理，就成为这次会议所要解决的重要问题。
    韩林光区长作报告  要改善七区环境卫生  加强生产工作的领导
    第七区区长韩林光就一年来第七区区公所在政权建设、市政卫生、文化教育、生产和社会救济等各方面的工作，作了详细的报告。关于今后的工作方针和计划，他指出：除了进一步巩固革命秩序外，要有重点地、适当地改善七区的环境卫生，加强对生产工作的领导，发展社会教育，加强对小学的领导，并适当地解决一部分失学儿童教育问题。公安局外三分局局长慕弗报告了一年来的治安工作。他要求代表们发动广大群众协助政府肃清匪特。韩林光和慕弗在报告中都一致强调检查干部作风和纪律，是一件很重要的工作，希望大家能尽量地提出批评，使今后七区的工作做得更好。
    昨日，来宾中有中国共产党北京市委员会代表李乐光、京市各民主党派代表翁世五、京市文教局局长翁独健、市妇联代表刘俊英，均相继向会议致词和祝贺。
