Xinhua News Agency, June 18th—The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a directive on providing relief to unemployed workers. The full text is as follows:

    Due to the long-term aggression of imperialism and the long-term rule of domestic reactionary forces, China's economy has suffered significant damage. The countryside has become increasingly impoverished and bankrupt, and national industries have not only failed to develop but have also declined, resulting in a large unemployed population in the cities. After the victory of the Liberation War, with the exception of the Northeast region, which has shown the normal development of the New Democratic economy due to the completion of land reform and diligent economic construction, the vast areas within the customs, due to the long-term blockade and continuous bombing by the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits directly supported by U.S. imperialism, have exacerbated the difficulties of industry and commerce. At the same time, those industrial and commercial sectors that previously catered exclusively to the licentious pleasures of landlords and bureaucratic capitalists are inevitably declining with the collapse of the reactionary ruling class. Farmers' purchasing power has also been greatly reduced due to the long-term war and the impact of last year's natural disasters in some areas. In addition, the People's Government has implemented several major measures in fiscal and economic affairs in recent months, which, although reversing the inflation that has caused great damage and suffering to the broad masses of people for twelve years and stabilizing prices, have also brought about temporary market stagnation and industrial and commercial depression, and even factory closures. Some industrial and commercial businesses that were previously engaged in speculation and trading have been unable to adapt and can no longer maintain themselves. All of this has led to a fairly serious phenomenon of worker unemployment in some cities, especially in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Chongqing.

    Obviously, this phenomenon is only a temporary difficulty, a difficulty in the midst of progress and victorious development, and a difficulty that can be overcome in the continued development of this progress and victory. Now, stable prices have created conditions for the normal development of industry and commerce. As long as we liberate Taiwan and completely annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, as long as this year's rural harvest is normal, and as long as we appropriately adjust the relationship between public and private sectors and labor-capital relations and correct the current shortcomings and errors in some work, the national industrial and commercial situation will improve. Furthermore, after the completion of land reform nationwide, the rational adjustment of existing industry and commerce, and the substantial reduction of expenditures required by state institutions, which will then be invested in industrial production, the national industrial and commercial situation will fundamentally improve. The current economic rise in the Northeast and the basic elimination of unemployment are good proof of this. People's governments at all levels should call on workers, staff, and industrialists and merchants in industrial and commercial enterprises in all localities to uphold the spirit of "sharing the same boat," consult with each other, work together, find appropriate solutions, continue to maintain business operations, and strive for the early arrival of improved economic conditions.

    However, unemployed workers are living in extremely difficult circumstances and urgently need rescue and cannot wait. The People's Government should give them great sympathy and care and provide them with possible assistance and relief. Therefore, the following items are specifically decided as guidelines for local areas to handle the current unemployment problem:

    (1) Within the state fiscal budget for this year, 400 million catties of grain will be allocated as a relief fund for unemployed workers, and the method of distribution will be determined by the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government in consultation with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

    (2) In areas where relief undertakings for unemployed workers are being carried out, all administrative aspects or capital owners of state-owned and private industrial and commercial enterprises, as well as all employed workers and staff, should pay a certain amount of unemployment relief funds on a monthly basis. The amount will be stipulated in the measures for relieving unemployed workers. At the same time, local people's governments should also find ways to allocate a portion of funds for the relief of unemployed workers.

    (3) Relief methods should focus on work-for-relief, supplemented by self-salvation through production, re-employment training, returning to the countryside for production, and issuing relief funds, in order to ensure that the use of relief funds can both alleviate the living difficulties of unemployed workers and benefit municipal construction.

    (4) The five cities with the most serious unemployment, namely Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Guangzhou, should immediately organize committees for the relief of unemployed workers and offices for the relief of unemployed workers to formulate relief plans and budgets, and report to this Council for approval and implementation. The required relief funds, in addition to those raised by the respective cities themselves, shall be paid from the unemployed worker relief fund designated by the Central People's Government. Other cities that must carry out unemployment relief should raise relief funds on their own in accordance with the principles described in item 2 of this directive. If there are insufficient funds, they may apply to this Council for approval to receive appropriate subsidies.

    (5) All cities that carry out unemployment relief undertakings should do so in accordance with the Provisional Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. If there are special circumstances that require changes, they must be reported to this Council for approval.

    (6) In order to gradually facilitate the employment and re-employment of currently unemployed workers, all state-owned and private enterprises should give priority to employing their original dismissed workers and staff when resuming production, expanding their business scope, and establishing new factories and enterprises. When recruiting new workers and staff, in principle, they should be uniformly introduced by the labor placement agencies established by the local labor bureau. Detailed measures will be formulated separately.

                              Premier of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, Zhou Enlai
                                  June 17, 1950

### 政务院关于救济失业工人的指示

    政务院关于救济失业工人的指示
    【新华社十八日讯】中央人民政府政务院发布关于救济失业工人的指示，全文如下：
    由于帝国主义的长期侵略与国内反动势力的长期统治，使中国经济遭受了重大的破坏，农村日益贫困破产，民族工业不仅不能发展，而且日益衰落，因而造成了城市中的广大失业群。解放战争胜利以后，除东北地区由于完成了土地改革，努力经济建设，已表现出新民主主义经济的正常发展外，关内广大地区，因美帝国主义直接支持的蒋匪残余肆行长期封锁与不断轰炸，加重了工商业的困难。同时，那些过去专供地主、官僚资产阶级荒淫享乐的工商行业，随着反动统治阶级的崩溃，趋于不可避免的没落。农民购买力又因长期战争与去年部分地区遭受灾荒的影响，大为降低。此外，人民政府最近几月来，在财政经济方面进行了若干重大措施，虽然扭转了十二年来使广大人民遭受莫大损害和痛苦的通货膨胀的局面，使物价趋于平稳；但同时也带来了暂时的市场停滞和工商业凋疲，甚至关厂停业的现象，某些原来从事投机买卖的工商业，一时转不过来更无法维持。所有这一切使得某些城市中，尤其是上海、南京、武汉、广州、重庆等城市中发生了相当严重的工人失业现象。
    很显然这种现象只是暂时的困难，是进步与胜利发展中的困难，是在这种进步与胜利继续发展中便可克服的困难。现在物价平稳已造成工商业正常发展的条件，只要打下台湾彻底歼灭蒋匪，只要今年农村收成正常，只要对公私关系和劳资关系加以适当调整并纠正目前某些工作中的缺点和错误，全国工商业情况便可好转；而在全国土地改革完成，现有工商业有了合理调整，国家机构所需经费有了大量节减转而投资于工业生产以后，全国工商业情况便可根本好转。东北目前经济上升及基本消灭失业的现象，就是很好的证明。各级人民政府应号召各地工商企业中的工人、职员与工商业者，本“同舟共济”的精神，互相协商，共同努力，找出适当办法，继续维持营业，度过目前难关，争取经济情形好转的早日到来。
    但是已经失业的工人，生活异常困难，急需救援，无法等待，人民政府应予以极大的同情和关怀，并给以可能的援助和救济。因此，特决定下列各项，作为各地处理目前失业工人问题的方针：
    （一）在本年度国家财政概算预备费项内拨出四亿斤粮食作为救济失业工人基金，由中央人民政府劳动部与中华全国总工会商定支配办法。
    （二）凡举办救济失业工人事业的地区，所有国营、私营的工商企业的行政方面或资方及所有在业工人和职员，均应按月缴纳一定的失业救济金，其数额在救济失业工人办法内规定之。同时，地方人民政府亦应设法拨出一部分资金作为救济失业工人之用。
    （三）救济办法，应以以工代赈为主，而以生产自救、转业训练、还乡生产、发给救济金等为补助办法，以求达到救济金的使用既能减轻失业工人的生活困难，又有益于市政建设的事业。
    （四）目前失业现象最为严重的上海、南京、武汉、重庆、广州五城市应即组织救济失业工人委员会和失业工人救济处，拟定救济计划和预算，报告本院批准实行。所需救济金额，除各该市自行筹措者外，由中央人民政府指定的救济失业工人基金中拨款支付之。其他城市必须举办失业工人救济者，均应根据本指示第二项所述的原则自行筹措救济基金，有不足时，报请本院批准后，得酌量拨款补助之。
    （五）凡举办救济失业工人事业的城市，均应依照中央人民政府政务院批准之救济失业工人暂行办法办理之。如有特殊情况必须加以变更者，须报请本院批准。
    （六）为了便于现在失业工人逐渐就业转业起见，各国营、私营企业在恢复生产、扩大经营范围及创立新工厂企业时，应尽先录用本企业原来解雇的工人和职员；在招雇新工人和职员时，原则上应由当地劳动局设立之劳动介绍所统一介绍。其详细办法，另行规定之。
                              中央人民政府政务院总理  周恩来
                                  一九五零年六月十七日
