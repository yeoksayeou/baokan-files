Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 5th dispatch from TASS: Numerous resolutions and letters protesting the Menzies government's bill to ban the Australian Communist Party have been sent to Canberra. The resolutions demand the repeal of this bill and condemn the Labor Party's attitude of supporting the bill in principle in Parliament.

It is reported that more than seventy delegations have arrived in Canberra, representing various labor unions and other groups to protest to the Australian government. Representatives of Australia's three largest unions—the Seamen's Union, the Waterside Workers' Union, and the Miners' Union—passed a resolution at a joint meeting held in Sydney this week, protesting the government's fascist bill. The New South Wales Shop Assistants Union and the Australian Teachers Federation have also demanded the repeal of the bill.
