　　Selecting Outstanding Rural Youths for Higher Education
    Letter of Suggestion from Reader Li Piao

To the Editor:

    I know many young students from peasant families in the old liberated areas. They have received long-term political education, have a high level of political awareness, have participated in various mass movements and practical struggles, and possess the excellent qualities of the peasant class, such as honesty, simplicity, and hard work. After completing junior high school courses in rural areas, they are eager to continue their studies. If they are further cultivated, they will become outstanding talents for the construction of New China. However, there are currently no senior high schools or vocational schools in rural areas, and it is difficult for them to go to cities to apply for schools, which prevents them from obtaining opportunities for further study.

    Under the current conditions of national financial difficulties, it is impossible to establish a large number of universities in rural areas. However, selecting a portion of rural youths with good academic performance from schools (junior high schools) or work positions to go to cities for higher education, and cultivating them into specialized talents, may be something that the current national economic strength can achieve. I hope relevant government departments will consider this suggestion.

　　选拔农村优秀青年进入高等学校学习
    读者李彯君来信建议编辑同志：
    我认识很多老解放区农村中农民成份的青年学生，他们受过长时期的政治教育，有较高的政治水平，参加过各种群众运动和实际斗争，并具有农民阶级诚实朴素、吃苦耐劳的优良品质。他们修完了农村中初中课程以后，都迫切要求继续学习。如果对他们再加以培养，他们将成为新中国的优秀建设人材。但是现在农村里还没有高级中学和专科学校，要上城市去投考学校也有许多困难，这样便使他们不能获得继续求学的机会。
    在目前国家财政困难的条件下，要在农村广设高等学校，那是不可能的。但从学校（初中）或工作岗位上选拔一部分学业优良的农村青年到城市去进较高级学校，把他们培养成专门人材，这也许是目前国家经济力量所能做到的。我希望政府有关部门考虑这个建议。
    李彯
