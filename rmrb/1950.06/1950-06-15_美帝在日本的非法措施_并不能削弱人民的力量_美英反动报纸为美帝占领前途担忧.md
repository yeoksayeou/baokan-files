　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Although the reactionary newspapers of the US and Britain all support MacArthur's brutal acts of persecuting the Japanese Communist Party and the patriotic Japanese people, they also anxiously express that these illegal measures cannot weaken the power of the Japanese people. On the contrary, it exposes the hypocrisy of the imperialists and their lackeys’ "democracy and freedom."

　　The New York Times of the United States believes that such reactionary measures would not work without military occupation. Therefore, the newspaper warned: This cannot "become a precedent for countries not under military control." The Christian Science Monitor admitted that the directive to "purge" the JCP leaders "did not clearly state the charges against each individual." This action cannot be "a good example of democracy." The Baltimore Sun was even more uneasy, saying: Since Japan's "current economic situation is what it is, taking such measures will probably not be able to cope with the growing economic crisis...The volatility within Japan is not limited to extremist groups. The tolerance of conservative groups is also being painfully tested."

　　The Times of London in Britain frankly admitted: "The US authorities in Japan are currently finding themselves in an increasingly deteriorating dilemma. Banning demonstrations is inconsistent with the provisions of the Japanese Constitution." The Manchester Guardian said that MacArthur's attempt to declare the JCP illegal was not a "smart" approach, one of the reasons being that "making a party illegal usually involves confusion with issues of democratic politics and liberalism."

　　The reactionary newspapers of the US and Britain are all worried that the reactionary measures taken by MacArthur will make the Japanese people increasingly united around the Japanese Communist Party, thereby creating a greater "danger" to the reactionary rule of the US and Japan. United Press International quoted a commentary from the Christian Science Monitor as saying: "The US occupation forces in Japan seem to be 'rapidly losing' their victory over the Communist Party." The report asked: "Why give the Communist Party the opportunity to say that they have to engage in underground struggles?" A dispatch from the Times of London in Tokyo stated: "General MacArthur's purge of communists has caused 'great anxiety,' worrying about the 'possible underground activities' of the purged communist leaders...Few Japanese believe that the current measures can greatly weaken the Japanese Communist Party."

　　美帝在日本的非法措施  并不能削弱人民的力量
    美英反动报纸为美帝占领前途担忧
    【新华社十四日讯】美英反动报纸虽都支持麦克阿瑟迫害日本共产党和日本爱国人民的横暴行为，但它们同时焦急地表示，这一非法措施并不能削弱日本人民的力量，反而揭穿了帝国主义者及其走狗们“民主自由”的假面具。
    美国纽约时报认为，如果没有军事占领，这种反动措施是行不通的。因此该报警告说：这不能“成为不在军事管制中的国家的先例”。基督教科学箴言报承认，“整肃”日共领袖的指令，“并未明确指出每个人的罪状”。这一行动不能成为“民主的好榜样”。巴尔的摩太阳报更不安地说：日本“目前的经济情况既然如此，采取这一类措施大概也不能应付日益增长的经济危机……。日本国内的浮躁，并不限于过激集团。保守集团的容忍性，也在受着痛苦的考验。”
    英国伦敦泰晤士报率直地承认：“目前美国驻日当局发觉本身所处的进退维谷的状况正在不断恶化。禁止示威是不合日本宪法的规定的。”曼彻斯特卫报说，麦克阿瑟要宣布日共非法，不是“聪明”的办法，原因之一是“促使一个政党为非法，通常总要与民主政治与自由主义的问题混淆不清。”
    美英反动报纸都担心麦克阿瑟所采取的反动措施，将使日本人民愈益团结在日本共产党的周围从而造成对于美日反动统治的更大的“危险”。合众社引基督教箴言报的评论称：“美国驻日占领军看来‘将迅速失去’对共产党的胜利”。该报问道：“为什么给共产党以机会来说他们不得不从事地下斗争呢？”伦敦泰晤士报东京讯则称：“麦克阿瑟将军的清洗共产党人已引起了‘极大的忧虑’，忧虑被清洗的共产党领袖的‘可能的地下活动’。……很少日本人相信目前的措施能大大削弱日本共产党。”
