　　Municipal People's Court Completes Clearing of Backlogged Cases
    Forty Days to Conclude Over Four Thousand Two Hundred New and Old Cases
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Court's work on clearing backlogged cases has been successfully completed on the 22nd, after forty days of effort. As of the 21st, a total of 4,233 civil and criminal cases were concluded; in addition to clearing 2,728 backlogged cases, 1,505 new cases were also processed. Through this clearing of backlogged cases, the Municipal Court's connections with various sectors, especially with the Public Security Bureau and district offices, have become closer, which has prepared favorable conditions for the future work of the Municipal Court and the upcoming establishment of district courts.
    [Another Dispatch] After the completion of the Municipal People's Court's work on clearing backlogged cases, in the past two days, the district trial groups and various units within the court have been summarizing their work and bidding farewell to the personnel who were transferred from other departments to assist in the work and are returning to their original posts. The personnel who were transferred to work expressed that they had gained a lot after participating in the court's work. At the farewell meeting of the Sixth District Trial Group, trade union cadre Wang Zhangqi said: "This participation in judicial work is a very good test and education of my policy level. In the future, when I return to the trade union, I must properly mediate some disputes among workers and not push everything to the court." At the farewell meeting of the execution team, the staff of the Public Security Bureau unanimously believed that through this intensive work, they have initially understood the consistency between the work of the court and the work of the public security organs. In the past, due to less contact, the coordination between each other in the work was not enough. In the future, we should strive to overcome this bias.

　　市人民法院清理积案完竣
    四十日共结清新旧案件四千二百余件
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民法院清理积案工作，经过四十天的努力，已于二十二日胜利完成。截至二十一日止，共结民事、刑事案件四千二百三十三件；除清理了积案二千七百二十八件外，还处理了新案一千五百零五件。经过这次清理积案工作，市法院与各方面的联系，尤其是与公安局和区公所的联系更加密切了，这给今后市法院的工作和即将成立的区法院工作准备了有利的条件。
    【又讯】市人民法院清理积案工作完成后，近两日来，各区审判组和院内各单位正总结工作和欢送这次从其他部门调来帮助工作的人员返回原工作岗位。调来工作的人员表示参加法院工作后得到不少收获。在第六区审判组的欢送会上，工会干部王章琦说：“这次参加司法工作对我的政策水平是很好的考验和教育。今后我回到工会去，对工人间的一些纠纷，一定要好好进行和解，不要遇事就往法院推。”在执行队的欢送会上，公安局的工作人员一致认为经过这次突击工作，他们初步了解到法院工作和公安工作的一致性，过去由于联系较少，彼此在工作上的配合不够。今后当力求克服这种偏向。
