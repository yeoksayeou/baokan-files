Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch:

　　Pingyuan Province's wheat harvest is nearing completion, with an estimated yield of around 70%. Except for over 500,000 people in areas where flooding has prevented cultivation and where the wheat harvest has been extremely poor, the remaining over 2 million disaster victims in the province have successfully survived the spring famine. In order to address the upcoming summer famine problem faced by the aforementioned 500,000 plus disaster victims, the Provincial People's Government has formulated a production-based plan to overcome the famine.

　　The province's victory over the spring famine and the smooth completion of the summer harvest are the result of the half-year-long struggle of the Communist Party organizations and the People's Government at all levels in the province leading the broad masses of people. The province's disaster relief work can be roughly divided into two stages: At the beginning of the disaster in September last year, due to insufficient understanding of the disaster situation by leaders at all levels, the failure to earnestly implement the policy of centering on production for disaster relief and organizing disaster victims to save themselves through production, the disaster once developed, and some lightly affected areas became severely affected areas, and the number of disaster victims increased from 2.5 million to 2.7 million. However, this serious situation was quickly reversed with the leadership and assistance of the Central People's Government and the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, as well as the efforts of cadres at all levels in the province. By February of this year, the province's disaster relief work had entered a new stage. From the Provincial People's Government to the People's Governments at the county, district and village levels, the policy of self-reliance through production was vigorously implemented. The Provincial Government transferred capable cadres to form work groups, teams, and squads, led by Vice Chairman of the Provincial Government Han Zheyifu and others, to inspect and assist disaster relief work in various disaster areas, and allocated grain to support disaster victims' self-reliance through production. As a result, agricultural and sideline production was fully launched. In agriculture, the Provincial Government successively loaned out 13 million catties of wheat seeds, organizing disaster victims to plant wheat on a large scale, with the planting area accounting for over 80% of drained land, thereby greatly consolidating the disaster victims' confidence in overcoming the famine. Sideline production, under the principle of "relying on mountains if near mountains, relying on water if near water," developed dozens of types, such as transportation, textile, stone quarrying, mat weaving, and fishing. According to May statistics, over 80% of male laborers in disaster areas participated in sideline production, and even in areas with poorer work, the figure reached around 50%. The broad masses of disaster victims relied on sideline production to solve their livelihood problems during the spring famine, and individual areas even had savings. For example, Zhanglou Village in Jinxiang County, one of the severely affected areas, increased its livestock by 14 heads through sideline production. Work-for-relief programs also played a significant role in disaster relief work, with the two projects of river repair and mountain quarrying alone providing disaster victims with 34.76 million catties of wage grain, thereby solving the livelihood problems of one-third of the disaster victims along the river. In addition, in Liangshan County, a severely affected area with low-lying terrain and no hope of cultivation, more than 5,000 disaster victims were organized to move to the Northeast.

　　Currently, the Provincial People's Government is paying attention to further resolving the summer famine problem. In some areas of eight counties, including Nanwang and Liangshan, due to long-term water accumulation, cultivation conditions have been lost and there is no wheat to harvest. These areas have a total of approximately 500,000 plus disaster victims. The Provincial People's Government has formulated specific plans for this, and has instructed all localities to guide disaster victims to turn to new production paths, such as developing aquatic production, dredging rivers through work-for-relief programs, etc., and to prepare for the relocation of some disaster victims after the autumn harvest. All economic departments should vigorously support disaster victims' production, especially cooperatives should help disaster victims solve the difficulties of product sales and raw material supply. The Provincial Government is also considering slowing down the recovery of loaned grain, appropriately reducing the burden on disaster areas, and issuing necessary production loans. In order to solve the problem of the sales of lake products (reeds, lotus roots, water chestnuts, etc.), the Provincial Government plans to establish a lake product supply and marketing cooperative recently. For disaster victims fleeing the famine, the Provincial Government calls on all localities to properly resettle them and engage in local production; appropriate relief should be provided to the families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and families of supply-system cadres without labor, as well as the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed. For areas without disasters, the Provincial Government calls for efforts to increase production and save for famine prevention. In addition, the Provincial Government stipulates that production and disaster relief committees at all levels must still be retained in order to unify leadership and do a good job in preventing the summer famine.

### 平原积极预防夏荒  大部灾民度过春荒

　　平原积极预防夏荒  大部灾民度过春荒
    【新华社十二日讯】平原省麦收即将完毕，年景在七成左右。全省除因水未退失掉耕作条件与麦收极坏地区的五十余万人以外，其余二百余万灾民已胜利度过春荒。为了解决上述地区五十余万灾民即将面临的夏荒问题，该省人民政府已作出生产度荒的计划。
    该省战胜春荒与顺利地完成夏收，是半年来该省共产党的各级组织和人民政府领导广大人民奋斗的成果。该省生产救灾工作大致可分两个阶段：去年九月灾荒形成之初，由于各级领导机关对灾情认识不足，未能认真贯彻以生产救灾为工作中心与组织灾民生产自救的方针，因此灾荒曾一度发展，若干轻灾区也变成重灾区，灾民由二百五十万人发展到二百七十万人。但此种严重局面经中央人民政府和中共中央华北局的领导与帮助，以及该省各级干部的努力，获得迅速转变。至今年二月，全省救灾工作即走上了新阶段。由省人民政府至县区村各级人民政府，都大力贯彻了生产自救方针。省府曾抽调得力干部，组成工作团、队、组，由省府韩哲一副主席等率领，分赴各灾区检查和帮助救灾工作，并拨粮支持灾民生产自救。于是，农副业生产便全面开展起来。在农业方面，省府先后贷出麦种达一千三百万斤，组织灾民大量播种麦子，播种面积占脱水地百分之八十之上，因而大大巩固了灾民的度荒信心。副业生产在“靠山吃山、靠水吃水”的方针下，开展起来的有贩运、纺织、开石、编席、捕鱼等数十种。据五月份统计，灾区男劳动力参加副业生产者达百分之八十以上，工作较差的地区也达百分之五十左右。广大灾民依靠副业生产解决了春荒期中的生活问题，个别地区并且还有积蓄。如重灾区之一的金乡县张楼村，在副业生产中增加了牲口十四头。在救灾工作中，以工代赈也起了很大作用，仅修河、开山运石两项即使灾民获得工资粮三千四百七十六万斤，沿河三分之一的灾民生活问题由此得到解决。此外，在地势低洼，耕种无望的重灾区梁山县，组织了五千余灾民移往东北。
    现在，该省人民政府正注意进一步解决夏荒问题。该省南旺、梁山等八县部分地区因长期积水，丧失了耕作条件，无麦可收。这些地区约共有五十余万灾民。该省人民政府为此已作出具体计划，并指示各地应领导灾民转向新的生产道路，如发展水上生产，以工代赈疏浚河道等，并应作好秋收后外移一部灾民的准备工作。各经济部门应大力支持灾民生产，特别是合作社更要帮助灾民解决产品销路和原料供给等困难。省府并考虑从缓收回贷粮，适当减轻灾区负担，发放必要的生产贷粮。为着解决湖产（苇子、藕、菱角等）销路问题，省府计划最近建立湖产供销合作社。对于逃荒灾民，省府号召各地应妥为安置，就地生产；对无劳力之烈士家属、军人家属和供给制工作干部家属以及老弱孤寡应予以适当救济。对于没有灾荒的地区，省府号召努力生产，节约备荒。此外，省府规定各级生产救灾委员会仍须保留，以便统一领导，做好防备夏荒的工作。
