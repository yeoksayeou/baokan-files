    Ningbo Native Produce Company Cooperates in Disaster Relief by Purchasing Straw Mats
    [This Newspaper News] Since its establishment on April 10th, the Ningbo Branch of the State-owned Native Produce Company, in order to cooperate with production for disaster relief and open up sales channels for native products, sent personnel to the Huanggulin area at the end of April to start purchasing straw mats. In one week, it purchased more than 5,000 various straw mats, and on May 10th, all of them were loaded and transported to Hangzhou for sale to Tianjin. This purchase greatly benefited the production and livelihood of the mat weavers, who account for 90% of the area's population. In order to take care of the difficulties faced by the Dinghai fishermen, who have long suffered from the cruel rule of the reactionaries and were unable to sell their fish products or bring in grain, the company decided to purchase 30,000 dan of fresh fish and arranged for the Grain Company to transport grain there.

    宁波土产公司配合救灾收购草席
    【本报讯】国营土产公司宁波分公司自四月十日成立后，为配合生产救灾、打开土产销路，于四月底即派人深入黄古林区展开收席工作，一周间即收购各种草席五千余条，并于五月十日全部装运杭州转往天津销售。此次收购对占该区人口百分之九十的席民生产生活裨益极大。该公司为照顾定海渔民长期受反动派残酷统治，渔产不能外销，粮食亦不能进去的困难，决定前往收购鲜鱼三万担，并由粮食公司运去粮食。
