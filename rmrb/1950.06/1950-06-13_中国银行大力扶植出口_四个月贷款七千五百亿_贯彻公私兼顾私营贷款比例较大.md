　　Bank of China Vigorously Supports Exports
    750 Billion Loaned in Four Months
    Implements a Policy of Considering Both Public and Private Interests, with a Relatively Large Proportion of Loans to Private Enterprises
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to vigorously support exports, the Bank of China issued export loans totaling over 750 billion yuan in the four months from January to April. According to incomplete statistics from branches in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xiamen, Shandong, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, RMB loans totaled approximately 186.8 billion yuan, and foreign currency loans totaled the equivalent of 564 billion yuan in local currency, for a total of 750.8 billion yuan (excluding foreign currency loans to state-owned enterprises). This is an increase of 2.8 times compared to the total of 194.6 billion yuan in local currency loaned by the Tianjin and Shanghai branches throughout last year. The increase in loan amounts has been particularly significant since the National Financial Conference. For example, the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China's foreign currency loans averaged over 86.8 billion yuan per month in local currency in the first quarter of this year, while in April it loaned 167.2 billion yuan, an increase of 93 percent compared to the previous period.

    The loan recipients in various regions are: operators dealing in tung oil, tea, eggs, fur, vegetable oil, mountain products, bristles, and other seven types of goods, as well as major local specialties. For example, in Shanghai, loans for tung oil accounted for 35.5 percent, tea for 30.1 percent, bristles for 9 percent, and feathers for 7.3 percent, with these four items accounting for 81.9 percent of all loans. In Tianjin, the focus was on seven items, including tung oil, bristles, eggs, fur, casings, wool, and mountain herbs and medicines. According to Tianjin Customs statistics, these seven items accounted for 61.56 percent of the total export value in the four months. Shandong focused on raw rice, raw oil, eggs, sesame, and cloth, while Guangdong focused on tung oil, vegetable oil, and local specialties such as firewood, timber, and tobacco. At the same time, the spirit of considering both public and private interests was also implemented in the loans. For example, in Shanghai, state-owned enterprises accounted for 16.6 percent of local currency loans, while private enterprises accounted for 83.4 percent. In Tianjin, state-owned enterprises accounted for 12.2 percent of local currency loans, while private enterprises accounted for 87.8 percent; state-owned enterprises accounted for 53.3 percent of foreign currency loans, while private enterprises accounted for 46.7 percent. In Chongqing, state-owned enterprises accounted for 60 percent, while private enterprises accounted for 40 percent. In Shandong, state-owned enterprises accounted for 88 percent of loans from January to March, while all loans in April were granted to private enterprises. In Wuhan, the proportion of private enterprise loans increased from 6.3 percent in January to 28.6 percent in February, and reached 84.9 percent in March.

    In addition, in order to achieve the goal of vigorously supporting exports and striving to complete the foreign exchange tasks assigned by the National Financial Conference, various branches have not only taken care of export manufacturers in various aspects according to different specific circumstances at different times, but have also created many new support methods. For example, Tianjin's foreign currency exchange and pre-settlement of foreign exchange methods, and Shanghai's transshipment and combined transportation through Tianjin and Shandong to encourage manufacturers to strive for exports under the blockade. Furthermore, in order to strengthen the connection between the port branches and the inland branches in the North China region, a joint business meeting of five provinces was held, and a general network of exchange settlements was established; after the Financial Conference, this exchange settlement network has been expanded to more than one hundred locations. All of these have played a significant role in developing foreign trade and promoting urban-rural exchange.

    In the future, with the lifting of the maritime blockade, foreign trade will further develop, and the various branches will play a more active role in organizing public and private forces and coordinating with trade and cooperative departments to strengthen the production guidance of export goods.

　　中国银行大力扶植出口
    四个月贷款七千五百亿     
    贯彻公私兼顾私营贷款比例较大
    【本报讯】中国银行为大力扶植出口，一至四月四个月内发放出口贷款七千五百余亿元。据京、津、沪、汉、渝、厦、鲁、粤、浙等行处不完全统计，共放出人民币贷款约一千八百六十八亿元，外币贷款合本币五千六百四十亿元，合计七千五百零八亿元（公营外币贷款尚不在内），比去年全年津、沪两行共贷本币一千九百四十六亿元增加了二·八倍。特别在全国金融会议后，贷款额的增加更为显著。如津中国银行，今年首季外币贷款合本币每月平均为八百六十八亿余元，而四月份则贷出一千六百七十二亿元，较前增加百分之九十三。
    各地贷款对象是：经营桐油、茶叶、蛋品、皮毛、植物油料、山货、猪鬃等七项物资及各该地大宗土产的经营者。如沪行桐油贷款占百分之三五·五，茶叶占百分之三○·一，猪鬃占百分之九，羽毛占百分之七·三，四项共占全部贷款的百分之八一·九。津行以桐油、猪鬃、蛋品、皮毛、肠衣、羊毛绒、山货药材等七项为主。据天津海关统计，这七项物资占四个月出口总额的百分之六一·五六。山东以生米、生油、蛋品、芝麻、纱布，广东以桐油、植物油及当地大宗的柴炭、木材、烟叶为主。同时，在贷款中，也贯彻了公私兼顾的精神。如沪行本币贷款公营占百分之一六·六，私营占百分之八三·四。津行本币贷款公营占百分之一二·二，私营占百分之八七·八；外币贷款公营占百分之五三·三，私营占百分之四六·七。渝行公营占百分之六○，私营占百分之四○。鲁行一至三月份公营占百分之八八，四月份则全部贷给私营。汉行私营比重从一月的百分之六·三增至百分之二八·六，三月则达到百分之八四·九。
    此外，各行为了达到大力扶植出口的目的和争取完成全国金融会议所给予的外汇任务，除在各个不同时期根据不同的具体情况，从各方面照顾出口厂商外，还曾经创造了很多新的扶植办法。如津行的外币埠汇及预结外汇办法，沪行的为鼓励厂商在封锁下争取出口的津、鲁转口及联运等都是。又如华北地区为了加强各口岸行与内地行的联系，曾经召开了五省业务联席会议，普遍建立押汇网；金融会议后，此种押汇网已扩充至百余处。所有这些，对于发展对外贸易与促进城乡交流都起着很大的作用。
    今后随着海上封锁的解除，对外贸易将会有进一步的发展，各行所在组织公私力量及配合贸易、合作部门加强出口物资的生产指导上，更将起积极的推动作用。
