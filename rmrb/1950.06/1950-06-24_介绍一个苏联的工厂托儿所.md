　　Introducing a Soviet Factory Nursery
　　Zhu Zhongli
　　Recently, a professor took me to visit a nursery in Moscow.

　　This nursery is attached to a silk weaving factory. It accommodates more than one hundred infants from newborns to three years old. The nursery has a director, a pediatrician, and a dozen educational nurses and nannies, as well as staff engaged in nutrition, cleaning, and laundry.

　　The time children stay in the nursery varies. Some stay for nine hours, some for twelve hours, and some for the whole week. This is to accommodate the different working conditions of the workers, which is a great convenience for working women who do not live in the area or work night shifts. The nursery can also accept requests from mothers who have sudden accidents (such as illness) and extend the time their children stay in the nursery at any time. Every morning, mothers send their children to the nursery, the earliest being at seven o'clock. Mothers can send their children to the nursery as early or as late as their own working hours allow.

　　In this nursery, mothers pay very little each month, only ten percent of the total monthly cost for each child, with the other ninety percent being borne by the state and the factory. The nursery is well-equipped, and the buildings are artistically colored throughout, making people feel very comfortable as soon as they walk in.

　　Children in the nursery are divided into three groups according to age. The food and management methods are different for each group, as are the toys they play with and the times they sleep, to meet the needs of the children's physiological development.

　　We first entered the room of the two- to three-year-old group of children. There were two connected rooms here. The walls of the room were hung with various colorful pictures, colored paper, and colored lights, as well as a photo of Comrade Stalin warmly hugging a fat child. In the middle of the room and in the corners were furnishings, toys, and children's structures. All of them were painted round objects, not square or sharp, to avoid children getting hurt. The tables, chairs, and even the sofa were specially made, small and short.

　　There were twenty children here, and it was the moment before mealtime. I saw each child habitually wash their hands in front of the nanny and then take their own bib from a cloth pocket on the wall. They all recognized the marks on their bib pockets, some with puppies, some with baby shapes, and some with airplanes. Then, they waited at their seats for the nanny to bring milk and bread. They eat five meals a day. Children who finished eating first were immediately changed by the educational nurse or nanny, because it was time for their afternoon nap. They were wrapped in a cotton pocket with only their heads exposed, wrapped in white headscarves. Before long, the sound of deep sleeping breaths could be heard.

　　Another group was the one- to two-year-old group, with about seventeen or eighteen children playing vigorously. More than half of the little girls were very eye-catching, with a beautiful bow tied on their long curly hair.

　　All the toys in the room were suitable for children of this age. A dozen children jumped in the room, not needing much supervision. Only one educational nurse sat there, still doing work in her hands. We stayed here happily for half an hour, and not a single child cried or shouted, nor did any falls or injuries occur. This management method is worth learning.

　　The equipment in the baby room was another set. The main things were two: one was a large and low sitting fence, inside which there were five or six babies sleeping in one direction and crawling in another, holding small toys in their hands. The other was a long small corridor with handrails on both sides, and a wooden structure in the middle to help children stand or take a few steps, especially for children around one year old to learn to stand and take their first steps. These two devices are scientific ways to reduce manpower. In this group, there were a total of eleven or twelve babies, with only two staff members taking care of them, but the order was very good.

　　In a breastfeeding room, a mother was holding her baby and breastfeeding. She was wearing the nursery's sterilized white clothes, had washed her hands in advance, and came to the nursery according to the time her baby needed to suckle. The director told me that the nursery's babies lacked milk nutrition. For this phenomenon, a team of milk-providing mothers was specially organized, with healthy and milk-rich mothers providing part of the milk.

　　Each group receives children in the morning in the reception room. We went to this reception room. The room had lockers for the children of this group. After the mothers brought their children, they first entered this room and changed into the nursery's clothes. Their own clothes were placed in their respective lockers. In the reception room, the educational nurse talked with the mother, inquiring about the child's situation at home last night: Did they sleep well? Did they eat well? Did they have diarrhea? The educational nurse had to observe the child's appearance and also check their temperature once. If a disease was found, they were not allowed to enter the children's room and were dealt with separately. If a child was absent and did not come, the educational nurse had to contact the family to find out the reason for not coming and tell the pediatrician. If they were sick, the doctor had to go to see them free of charge.

　　In this nursery, each group has its own bathroom. There is an isolation room to isolate children who suddenly become ill, but they are transferred to the hospital after a very short time. Staff members who come to work enter and leave the entrance at another location, and they also need to change into the work clothes inside the nursery before they are allowed to enter and contact the children.

　　The equipment in all the rooms of the nursery strictly complies with hygiene rules, such as the size of the volume, the intensity of the light, the height of the temperature, the installation of air exchange machines, and the balconies and small squares, all of which meet hygiene needs. For example, the choice of toys must not only be harmless to the children's bodies, but also be able to withstand disinfection and not be easily damaged after playing for a long time.

　　The pediatrician in the nursery told me: "Children in the nursery rarely get sick. Although sometimes unavoidable childhood infectious diseases such as measles occur, they rarely spread, so the child mortality rate is very small." Tens of millions of working women send their children to the nursery with peace of mind.

　　The basic work of Soviet nurseries is the correct cultivation and care of children. Many aspects cannot be separated from medical work and are directly under the supervision of health agencies. Each nursery also has a nurse to help the pediatrician with daily work. Each child receives a health check at least once every two weeks, and children with congenital deficiencies and malnutrition are checked more frequently. The child's physical and intellectual development and health status are recorded in the child's developmental history.

### 介绍一个苏联的工厂托儿所

　　介绍一个苏联的工厂托儿所
    朱仲丽
    最近一位教授带我参观了莫斯科城内的一个托儿所。
    这个托儿所是一个丝织业工厂附设的。共容纳初生到三岁的婴儿一百多名。所里有所长、小儿科医生和十几位教养护士及褓姆，还有一部人员从事于营养、打扫及洗衣等工作。
    小儿寄留在托儿所里的时间各有不同。有的寄留九小时，有的十二小时，有的整星期，这是为了照顾工友们的不同工作条件，对于不住在本区的，或夜间上班的劳动妇女有莫大的方便。托儿所还可以接受临时发生了事故的母亲（如生病）的请求，随时加长小儿寄留于托儿所的时间。每天早晨，母亲送小儿入托儿所，最早的是七点钟。母亲们可以按照自己上班的工作时间，可迟可早的将小儿送往托儿所。
    在这个托儿所里，母亲每月付费很少，只有每一个小儿每月全部用费的百分之十，其他百分之九十全由国家及工厂负担了。托儿所的设备很完善，房屋到处富有艺术性的色彩，使人一走进去，就感到非常舒服。
    所内小儿按年龄划分三组，食物和管理方法各组不同，玩的器具也不同，睡觉的时间也不一致，以符合小儿生理上发展的需要。
    我们首先进到一个二至三岁组的小儿房间里。这里有连着的两间房，房子的墙壁上挂有各种色彩的画片、彩纸、彩灯，还有斯大林同志很亲热地抱着一个胖孩子的照片。房中间及角落里陈设着日用家具、玩具及小儿建筑物。都是油漆了的圆形物，不是方形或尖形，免得小儿碰伤。桌子、椅子，连沙发也是特地做的，又小又矮。
    这里有二十个小孩，这时正是吃饭前的一刻。我看见每个小孩很习惯地到褓姆跟前洗手，再到墙上一个布口袋里拿各人自己的饭巾。他们都认识自己饭巾口袋上的标记，有的是小狗儿，有的是小娃形，有的是飞机。然后，他们便在自己的位子上候着褓姆端牛奶面包来。每天吃五顿。先吃完了饭的小孩，马上让教养护士或褓姆换衣服，因为到了应睡午觉的时候了。他们被包在一个棉做的口袋里，只有头部露在外边，用白色头巾包裹着。不一刻功夫就听见熟睡的呼吸声了。
    另外一组是一至二岁的儿童组，约有十七八个小孩正在玩的起劲。过半数的小女孩子都很引人注意。头上一个漂亮的蝴蝶结子，系在长长的绻发上。
    房里所有的玩具都是适合这样年龄的小儿的。十几个小孩在房里跳，不需要多人看管。只有一位教养护士坐在那里，手中还做着活儿。我们在这儿愉快地停留了半小时，没有一个小儿哭过一声，或喊叫过一声，也没有什么跌倒损伤事件发生。这种管理方法是值得学习的。
    婴儿组的房间里的设备又是另一套。主要是两样东西：一是大而低的坐栏，里面有五六个婴儿东睡一个、西爬一个，手心中抓着小玩具。另一样是长形的小走廊，两边是扶手的地方，当中是帮助小孩站立，或行动数步的木质建筑物，专为一岁左右小孩学着站立和开步的设备。这两种设备是减少人力的科学办法。在这一组内，共有十一二个婴儿，只有两个人员照管，秩序却非常好。
    在一个哺乳室里，有一个母亲抱着自己的婴儿在哺乳。她全身穿着托儿所的消毒的白衣服，预先洗了手，按照婴儿需要吸乳的时间来托儿所。所长告诉我，托儿所有的婴儿缺乏乳汁营养。对这种现象，特别组织了输乳母亲队，由健康而多乳的母亲提供部分的乳量。
    每组早晨接收小儿，是在接待室进行的。我们走到了这个接待室。室内有本组的小儿更衣柜，母亲送小孩来后，首先进入这个房间，换上托儿所的衣服。自己的衣服则放在各自的柜格子里。在接待室里，教养护士与母亲进行谈话，查询昨夜小儿在家的情形：是否睡得好？吃的好？有没有泻肚子？教养护士必定要观察小儿的外表，还要检验一次体温。如果发现了疾病，则不让入小儿室而另外处理。如小儿缺席不来，教养护士必与家庭连系，弄清楚没有来的原因，并告诉小儿科医师。如果是生了病，医师必须义务地前往诊视。
    这个托儿所里，每组有自己的沐浴室。有隔离室，隔离忽然患病的孩子，但时间很短就转送到医院去了。工作人员来所工作的，出入门口在另外一个地点，同样需得更换所内的工作服，才准入内接触小孩。
    全所各个房间里的设备，都严格的遵守卫生规则，如容积的大小，光线的强弱，温度的高低，抽换空气机器的设置以及凉台小广场等等，都适合卫生需要。又如玩具的选择，既要对小儿身体无害，又要经得起消毒，久玩不坏。
    所里的小儿科医师告诉我：“托儿所的小孩患病的很少，虽然有时发生了难避免的小儿传染病如麻疹之类，但很少传染开来，因此小儿死亡率很小。”成千万的劳动妇女，很安心地把小孩送到托儿所。
    苏联托儿所基本工作是正确的培养和看护儿童，许多方面不能与医务工作分离，而且直接处在保健机关的监管之下。每一个托儿所还有一位护士帮助小儿科医师进行每日的工作。每一个小孩至少两星期受健康检查一次，对于先天不足的和营养不良的小儿，检查的更勤。把小儿的体力及智力发育以及健康情形记载于小儿发育史内。
