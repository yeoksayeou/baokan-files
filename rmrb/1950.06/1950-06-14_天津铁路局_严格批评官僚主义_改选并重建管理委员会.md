　　Tianjin Railway Bureau
    Strictly Criticizes Bureaucracy
    Re-elects and Reconstructs Management Committee
    [Report from Tianjin by this newspaper] While opposing bureaucratic work styles, the Tianjin Railway Bureau is vigorously promoting democratic management. Since April, the bureau has established and re-elected 73 employee representative conferences and factory management committees.
    In March of this year, the bureau inspected the work of the management committees in its subordinate units and found that leading cadres generally did not pay enough attention to the management committees and did not have a clear understanding of the nature and tasks of the management committees. Some units regarded the management committees as trade unions; others only submitted personnel matters such as merits, demerits, rewards, and punishments to the management committees for resolution. Many management committees could not solve problems due to a lack of preparation and planning before meetings, and after meetings, they neither conveyed nor implemented decisions, did not solicit opinions from the masses, nor did they report their work to the masses. In short, under administrative monopoly and substitution, many management committees became mere formalities. In order to correct this bureaucratic work style, the Party and government leaders of the Railway Bureau first carried out serious criticism and self-criticism, and at the same time, re-elected the management committees. On the basis of establishing a democratic management system, the production competition and the movement to create new records are now underway in various units of the Tianjin Railway Bureau.

　　天津铁路局
    严格批评官僚主义
    改选并重建管理委员会
    【本报天津讯】天津铁路管理局与反对官僚主义作风的同时，大力推行民主管理化。四月份以来，该局共建立并改选了七十三个职工代表会和工厂管理委员会。
    今年三月间，该局曾检查了所属各单位管委会工作情形，发现领导干部对管委会普遍不够重视，对管委会的性质和任务认识不清，有的单位把管委会当作工会性质看待；有的仅把功、过、奖、惩等人事工作提交管委会解决；很多管委会因会前无准备、无计划，开会也解决不了问题，会后又既不传达也不执行，不征求群众意见，也不向群众报告工作。总之，在行政包办代替下，许多管委会均流于形式。路局党、政领导为纠正此种官僚主义作风，首先开展了严肃的批评和自我批评，同时并进行改选了管委会。在建立了民主管理制度的基础上，天津路局各单位的生产竞赛和创造新纪录运动现正开展中。
