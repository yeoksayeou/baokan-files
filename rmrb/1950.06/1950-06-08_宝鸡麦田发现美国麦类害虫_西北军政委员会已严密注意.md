Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 2nd. Recently, a new type of insect pest has been discovered in wheat fields in Baoji, Shaanxi Province, and in individual areas of Chang'an, Wugong, and Lintong. The pest is called the wheat blossom midge, one of the five major wheat pests in the United States, and has only recently been transmitted to China with the import of American wheat. The adult insects lay their eggs on the wheat ears when the wheat is heading and flowering. The larvae then suck the pollen and juices, preventing the wheat grains from growing properly. In severe cases, the entire ear becomes empty. The larvae pupate in the soil when the wheat ripens and emerge as adults the following spring. In Weibin District of Baoji City, 50% of the wheat fields have been found to be infested with wheat blossom midge. The Northwest Military and Political Committee has paid close attention to this issue. In addition to reporting it to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Central People's Government, it has dispatched 35 teachers and students from the Northwest Agricultural College to Chang'an and other places to assist farmers in controlling and eliminating the pest, as well as to investigate the extent of the wheat blossom midge's damage and study control methods.

　　宝鸡麦田发现美国麦类害虫  西北军政委员会已严密注意
    【新华社西安二日电】陕西省宝鸡一带及长安、武功、临潼个别地区的麦田，近发现一种新的虫害。害虫名吸浆虫，为美国麦类五大害虫之一，近年始随美麦输入而传至我国。其成虫每年在小麦吐穗扬花时产卵于花穗，幼虫即吸食花粉与汁液，使麦粒不能长成，严重时全穗皆成空壳。幼虫于麦熟时入土化蛹，第二年春羽化。宝鸡市渭滨区百分之五十的麦田均发现吸浆虫。西北军政委员会已予严密注意，除报中央人民政府农林部外，已派西北农学院师生三十五人，分赴长安等地协助农民除治，并调查吸浆虫危害情形和研究除治方法。
