　　Preventing New Disasters

　　According to reports from various regions, while the summer harvest is underway and the spring famine has been largely overcome, new disasters have emerged in some areas. For example, some counties and districts in Shanxi, Hebei, Pingyuan, and Henan provinces have experienced hailstorms, destroying crops and causing injuries and deaths to people and livestock. In Hebei province, wheat yellowing disease has occurred in some areas, causing significant losses in some counties and districts. In northern Jiangsu, some areas have experienced flooding, significantly impacting the wheat harvest.

　　Although the scale of these disasters is not large, they deserve serious attention, and we must immediately combat them. The provincial governments of Hebei, Pingyuan, Hunan, Henan, and Shandong have already instructed their subordinates to pay attention to preventing summer famine, which is absolutely necessary. The Hebei Provincial People's Government's instruction to its subordinate special commissioner's offices and county governments to "establish a long-term ideology of production for self-reliance and self-help" is entirely correct.

　　The reason why China is prone to disasters is primarily due to the fact that China is a large agricultural country with relatively backward production technology. Agricultural production and handicraft production still account for about 90% of our national economy today. Even in the Northeast, where industry is relatively well-established, agricultural production still accounted for about 65% of the economy in 1949. Furthermore, our agricultural production technology is not yet able to control natural factors such as water and drought. As a result, less rain leads to drought, and more rain leads to flooding. Moreover, due to the country's vast territory and diverse climate, there is often a situation of abundance in the south and scarcity in the north, or a good harvest in dry land and disaster in waterlogged areas, demonstrating a very uneven state. Therefore, we must never assume that "all is well" and that "disasters will never happen again" simply because most areas have a good harvest or the major famines have been overcome.

　　We must also recognize that after the long-term devastation of imperialism and the Kuomintang, the Chinese peasants' ability to resist disasters is very weak today. This situation often causes minor disasters to easily turn into major disasters.

　　Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the Chinese people have full confidence in gradually changing the current situation of proneness to disasters and famines through the development of production, construction of water conservancy projects, afforestation, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. However, this is a long-term and arduous construction process that cannot be achieved in the short term. Local governments and people must maintain a high level of vigilance of "preventing disasters and famines every year" and make various preparations for preventing disasters at any time in order to reduce the occurrence of disasters. Even after disasters unfortunately occur, the extent of the damage can be reduced.

　　In order to prevent and prepare for famine, after this year's summer harvest, all regions should focus on promoting the concept of combining production with frugality, make long-term plans for sustained development, so as to accumulate strength, enhance the people's ability to resist disasters, and prepare for any unforeseen disasters.

　　Only by striving for the best possible outcome while preparing for the worst possible outcome can we always remain in a proactive position.

### 预防新的灾荒

　　预防新的灾荒
    根据各地反映，一方面夏收已在进行，春荒已基本度过；另一方面，在部分地区，新的灾情又已出现。例如：山西、河北、平原、河南等省内一部分县区，曾发生雹灾，毁了一部分庄稼，而且人畜均有死伤；在河北省，部分地区的小麦发生了黄疸病，部分县区损失甚重；在苏北，又有一部分地区发生水灾，麦收受了相当损失。
    上述灾情，虽然范围还不大，但是很值得重视，必须立即与这些灾荒作斗争。河北、平原、湖南、河南、山东等省府已指示所属注意防止夏荒，这是完全必要的。河北省人民政府指示所属专署与县政府要“树立长期生产自救自助的思想”，这是完全正确的。
    中国之所以容易发生灾荒，首先是由于中国是一个生产技术还很落后的农业大国。农业生产与手工业生产在我国国民经济中今天还是占着大约百分之九十的比重，在东北那样工业比较有基础的地区，一九四九年农业生产的比重仍占百分之六十五左右；而我们的农业生产的技术条件还不能控制水、旱等自然因素；因而，雨少成旱，雨多成涝；更由于国家疆土辽阔，气候不一，往往南丰北歉，或旱地丰收，水地成灾，表现出极不平衡的状态。因此，我们决不应当看到大部地方丰收，或主要灾荒已经度过，即以为“万事大吉”，“灾荒从此不会再来”。
    我们更要认识：经过帝国主义国民党的长期摧残，今天中国农民抗灾力量是很薄弱的，这种情形，常使轻灾很容易变成重灾。
    在中央人民政府领导之下，中国人民完全有信心从发展生产、兴修水利、植树造林、防治病虫害等工作中，逐步改变目前这种容易发生灾荒与饥馑的情况。但是，这是一个长期的艰苦的建设过程，不是短期内所能奏效的。各地政府与人民均须有“年年防灾荒”的高度警惕，随时作各种预防灾荒的准备，才能减少灾荒的发生；而在灾荒不幸发生之后，也可以减少灾害的程度。
    为了防荒备荒，在今年夏收之后，各地应着重提倡生产与节约相结合的观念，作细水长流的打算，以积蓄力量，增强人民抵抗灾荒的能力，防备万一的灾害。
    只有争取最好的可能，同时准备最坏的可能，我们才能够永远立于主动的地位。
