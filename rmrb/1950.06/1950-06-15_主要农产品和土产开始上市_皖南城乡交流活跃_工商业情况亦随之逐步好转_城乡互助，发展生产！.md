Xinhua News Agency, Wuhu, 12th. Major agricultural and native products in the Southern Anhui region have begun to enter the market, and urban-rural material exchange is becoming increasingly active. Rapeseed and barley harvesting has been completed in various parts of Southern Anhui, and wheat harvesting is nearing completion. Large-scale tea picking in the Huizhou and Chizhou regions is also coming to an end, and silk, ramie, and other products are being launched one after another. Farmers are transporting native products to the cities for sale. In recent days, the daily arrival of rapeseed in Wuhu has reached over 1,000 shi (石), and the daily listing of green tea in Tunxi has been around 100,000 jin (斤). In order to protect the interests of the vast number of farmers and prevent the stagnation of native products and excessively low prices, state-owned tea, native products, oil, and fur companies are specially purchasing appropriately in major native product areas and actively leading and organizing private merchants to transport and sell them. According to incomplete statistics, in May, the total value of tea, rapeseed, tung oil, silk, ramie, pig bristles, etc., purchased by the above-mentioned companies reached over 20 billion yuan. During the same period, the value of native products transported and sold outside the region by the native products company alone reached about 3 billion yuan. Merchants from Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shandong, Tianjin, and other places are also very enthusiastic about purchasing native products in Southern Anhui. Ships carrying goods from merchants from various places are coming and going in an endless stream. The average daily number of passenger and freight vehicles passing through the Wuhu-Tunxi highway in May reached about 200.

While state-owned native product companies and others organize the transportation and sale of native products, state-owned grain, cotton yarn, and general merchandise companies have transferred a large amount of grain and industrial products to supply the farmers in the native product areas. According to statistics, in May alone, the materials transported and sold to the native product areas included 10 million jin of grain and more than 4,700 bolts of cloth, which played a certain role in helping farmers overcome the spring famine and prevent the summer famine. With the active urban-rural material exchange, the industrial and commercial situation in general cities in Southern Anhui has gradually improved. Most of the tea-making, flour, and oil-pressing factories in Tunxi, Wuhu, and other places, which had previously been suspended due to a lack of raw materials, have resumed work. The trading volume of yarn, grain, agricultural tools, etc., in the market has increased compared to before. Taking Qimen and Tunxi, two tea-producing areas, as examples, the turnover of general industrial and commercial households in May increased by three to six times compared to April.

　　主要农产品和土产开始上市
    皖南城乡交流活跃     
    工商业情况亦随之逐步好转
    城乡互助，发展生产！
    【新华社芜湖十二日电】皖南地区主要农产品和土产已开始上市，城乡物资交流日益活跃。皖南各地菜籽和大麦收割已毕，小麦收割亦近尾声，徽州、池州两专区大规模的茶叶采摘也将结束，蚕丝、苎麻等正在陆续登场，农民纷纷运送土产入城销售。近日来芜湖菜籽到货日达千石以上，屯溪每天绿茶上市也在十万斤左右。为照顾广大农民利益，防止土产滞销和价格过贱等现象，国营茶叶、土产、油脂、皮毛等专业公司特在各主要土产区适当收购，并积极领导与组织私商运销。据不完全统计：五月份经上述各公司收购的茶叶、菜籽、桐油、丝麻、猪鬃等总值达二百亿元以上，同一时期内仅经土产公司组织运销区外的土产价值达三十亿元左右。南京、上海、苏州、杭州和山东、天津等外埠商人来皖南采购土产的也极为踊跃。各地客商办货船只络绎不绝。芜（湖）屯（溪）公路五月份平均每天过往客货汽车达二百辆左右。
    与国营土产公司等组织土产运销同时，国营粮食、花纱布、百货等专业公司调运了大批粮食与工业品供应土产区的农民。据总计：五月份内，运销土产区的物资仅粮食即达一千万斤，布四千七百多匹；对协助农民克服春荒和防备夏荒起了一定作用。皖南一般城市工商业情况随着城乡物资交流的活跃，亦已逐步好转。屯溪、芜湖等地以往因原料缺乏而停歇的制茶、面粉、榨油等工厂，大部已经复工；市场纱布、粮食、农具等交易量较前增加。以产茶区祁门、屯溪两地为例，一般工商户五月份营业额都比四月份增加了三至六倍。
