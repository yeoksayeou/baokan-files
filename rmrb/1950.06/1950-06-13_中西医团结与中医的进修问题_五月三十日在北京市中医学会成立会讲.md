Last October, we convened a National Health Administration Conference. At that meeting, we received instructions from Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and other leading comrades, instructing us to unite all Chinese medicine practitioners nationwide and help them improve their skills. After the meeting, we instructed various regions to organize Chinese medicine study groups, Chinese medicine research and study organizations, and to do a good job in uniting Chinese and Western medicine. Some places have already started working on this after receiving instructions, but it is not yet universal. Since its establishment, the Central Ministry of Health has done some work to unite Chinese medicine, such as holding symposiums on Chinese medicine, running advanced training schools for Chinese medicine, openly soliciting opinions on Chinese medicine nationwide, and conducting various surveys related to Chinese medicine. Today, the establishment of the Beijing Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine is one of these many efforts.

According to incomplete statistics, more than five million people die in China every year, and one hundred million people suffer from various illnesses of varying degrees on and off. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries never took effective measures to solve such a large mortality and morbidity rate. A large number of these people's illnesses and deaths were not properly treated. According to general surveys in rural areas, 80 percent of patients do not receive formal treatment. Estimating it this way, then out of the annual deaths, four million people do not receive formal medical assistance, and eighty million people do not receive formal treatment. Therefore, medical personnel bear a very heavy burden, and we should do everything in our power to solve this problem. As everyone knows, Article 48 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates: "Promote national sports, promote health and medical undertakings, and pay attention to protecting the health of mothers, infants, and children." We should consciously work towards this. To solve this problem, it is not enough to rely solely on the existing 20,000 Western doctors; it is impossible to shoulder this responsibility. On the other hand, many of these diseases are infectious, and if we rely solely on Chinese medicine for prevention and treatment, it will not be enough in terms of science and technology. Therefore, the task before us is that 20,000 Western doctors and hundreds of thousands of Chinese medicine practitioners must unite, cooperate, and assist each other to fight against diseases. We should point out that in the past, there was a gap between Chinese and Western medicine. Western doctors thought they were scientific, and Chinese medicine was not scientific, so they thought highly of themselves and looked down on Chinese medicine; this is not right. Some Chinese medicine practitioners also looked down on Western medicine, thinking that China had survived for thousands of years without Western medicine, so they were unwilling to approach them; this is also not right. In the past, many Chinese and Western medicine practitioners did not feel the heaviness of their responsibility or did not feel it deeply enough, nor did they realize that there is strength only in unity. The reactionary government in the past not only did not pay attention to the people's health problems, but also created wars, famines, and poverty, endangering the people's health, and of course, they would not pay attention to organizing, mobilizing, and educating Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to unite. Although some advanced doctors paid attention to the issue of unity between Chinese and Western medicine, they could not play a big role because of limited strength.

In the future, we must do a good job in uniting Chinese and Western medicine, and we must unite all medical personnel in the country, regardless of faction, under the slogan of "Serving the People," which, for our medical personnel, is also under the slogan of "Serving the People's Health Cause!" As long as you are willing to serve the people, we will unite, and we can unite.

Regarding the health cause of the Chinese people, there are many problems that need to be solved, such as nutrition, housing, clothing, infectious diseases, and various other diseases, there are dozens or even hundreds of problems. With the current manpower and resources, we can only choose the ones that harm the people the most and solve them first. The biggest threats to the economic construction and national defense construction of the new country are infectious diseases, endemic diseases, and occupational diseases. Among them, infectious diseases are even more serious. Therefore, Chinese and Western medicine should study the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases well, so that it may reduce the greatest morbidity and mortality. For this purpose, Chinese medicine must increase new scientific knowledge and experience, and the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases requires equipment, laboratories, and the collection of Chinese and foreign literature to be studied. In the past, Chinese medicine did not have this condition either. Therefore, in order to shoulder the new task of preventing and treating infectious diseases, Chinese medicine must solve the problem of advanced study. Some people may think that it is difficult to make Chinese medicine scientific, fearing that they will not be able to learn it. In fact, it is not that they cannot learn it. For example, if you train in our epidemic prevention training class, you can generally understand some common sense of epidemic prevention in just two or three weeks, although you will not be very proficient. Another example is that the method of preventing postpartum fever can be learned in a few hours. Now the Beijing Chinese Medicine Advanced Training School has courses on infectious diseases and other courses to make Chinese medicine scientific. Of course, to learn a new technology, you must abandon sectarian views and learn with an open mind. Now that Chinese medicine practitioners may be able to obtain some good advanced study conditions, it is hoped that everyone will make good use of these conditions, coupled with the many experiences that Chinese medicine already has, it will definitely enrich themselves. Chinese medicine has a promising future. The development of Chinese medicine technology meets the health requirements of the people, and the central and local health departments should treat this as an important task. The National Health Conference to be convened in July or August this year is preparing to propose a plan for discussion on the unity, improvement, and joint service of Chinese and Western medicine practitioners for the people's health cause. Representatives of Chinese medicine will also participate in that meeting. It is hoped that Chinese medicine practitioners across the country who are enthusiastic about serving the people can put forward their opinions on the Chinese people's health care cause through their representatives for the conference to study. As long as the opinions are beneficial to the people, the conference will definitely be happy to adopt them.

### 中西医团结与中医的进修问题  五月三十日在北京市中医学会成立会讲

　　中西医团结与中医的进修问题
    五月三十日在北京市中医学会成立会讲
    贺诚
    去年十月，我们曾召开了一次全国卫生行政会议。在那个会上，我们得到毛主席、朱总司令以及其他领导同志的指示，要我们团结全国的中医，并帮助中医提高技术。会后，我们已经指示各地组织中医学习，组织中医研究学习等团体，并作好中西医的团结工作。各地得到指示后，有些地方已经开始作了，只是还没有普遍。中央卫生部成立以后，已经作了一些团结中医的工作，譬如召开中医座谈会，办中医进修学校，在全国公开征集中医的意见，作有关中医的各种调查等。今天北京市中医学会成立也就是这许多工作中的一项。
    根据不完全的统计，中国人民每年死亡五百多万人，有一万万人口断断续续地害着各种轻重不同的病。这样大的死亡与生病率，过去国民党反动派，从来也没有采取有效的办法来解决。这些人的生病和死亡，其中有很大数量是未经正规医治的。根据乡村的一般调查，有百分之八十的病人得不到正规的治疗。这样来估计一下，那么每年死亡的人口中，就有四百万人未得到正规的医药帮助，有八千万人未得到正规的治疗。因此医务人员是负了很沉重的担子的，我们应该尽我们所有的力量来解决这个问题。大家知道，在中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第四十八条，已经明确地规定了：“提倡国民体育，推广卫生医药事业，并注意保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康。”我们应自觉地为此而努力。要解决此问题，如果只依靠现有的二万个西医是不够的，是无法担负起这个责任的。另一方面，这些病很多是传染病，如果单靠中医来进行预防治疗工作，在科学技术上也是不够的。因此，摆在面前的任务，就必须二万西医和几十万中医团结起来共同合作互相协助，来与疾病作斗争。我们应该指出，过去在中西医之间，是隔有鸿沟的。西医以为自己科学，中医不科学，就把自己看得很高，把中医看得很低；这是不对的。中医方面也有的看不起西医，认为过去中国几千年不曾有过西医也过去了，因而不愿和他们接近；这也是不对的。过去许多中西医没有觉到责任的沉重或者感觉不够深刻，也没有认识到只有团结才有力量。过去的反动政府不但不重视人民的健康问题，而且还制造战争、灾荒与贫困，危害人民的健康，当然他们更不会注意组织、发动、教育中西医团结了。有些先进的医生虽然注意到了中西医的团结问题，但是因为力量有限也不能起很大的作用。
    今后，我们一定要作好中西医的团结工作，一定要把全国医务人员不分派系地在“为人民服务”的口号下，对于我们医务人员来说，也就是在“为人民健康事业服务”的口号下，团结起来！只要愿意为人民服务，我们就要团结，也能团结。
    关于中国人民健康事业，应该解决的问题很多，如营养、居住、衣服、传染病，各种疾病等问题，有几十个以至上百个的问题。以现在的人力物力，只能选择危害人民最大的首先去解决。对新国家的经济建设和国防建设，危害最大的是传染病，地方病，职业病。其中传染病更为严重。因此中西医应很好地研究传染病的预防与治疗，这样也就可能减低最大的生病率与死亡率。为此目的中医必须增加新的科学知识和经验，而且传染病的预防与治疗，需要设备、化验室，搜集中外文献，才能研究，过去中医也没有这个条件。因此，中医为了担负防治传染病的新任务，就一定要解决进修问题。有些人也许会想，中医科学化是很难的，怕学不会。实际上并不是学不会的。譬如在我们办的防疫训练班受训，只要二三星期，大体就可以了解一些防疫的常识了，虽然还不能很熟练。又如防止四六风的方法有几小时就可学会。现在北京的中医进修学校就有传染病的课程，以及其它使中医科学化的课程。当然，要学会一门新技术，必须破除门户之见，虚心学习。今后中医既然可能获得一些好的进修条件，就希望大家好好利用这些条件，加上中医原有的很多的经验，一定会使自己充实起来。中医是有发展前途的。中医技术的开展，是符合人民健康要求的，中央和地方的卫生部都应当把这件事当成一种重要任务去办。今年七八月间将要召集的全国卫生会议，准备对于中西医的团结，提高，共同为人民健康事业服务的问题，提出方案来讨论。那个会也将有中医代表参加。希望全国热心服务人民的中医能经过自己的代表提出对中国人民保健事业的意见，以便大会研讨。只要有利于人民的意见，大会是必然乐于采纳的。
