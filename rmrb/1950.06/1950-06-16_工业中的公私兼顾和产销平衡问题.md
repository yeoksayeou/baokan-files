　　On the Problem of Public-Private Consideration and Production-Sales Balance in Industry
    Wang Xinyuan

    I.
    The main content of adjusting industry and commerce is to adjust the relationship between public and private sectors, and the relationship between production and sales, so as to achieve mutual benefit between public and private and balance between production and sales. During the period of reactionary rule, China's industry and commerce developed according to the laws of colonial-type capitalism. At that time, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, headed by the four major families, colluded with or relied on the forces of imperialism to "merge" China's national capital and "monopolize" production and sales. In such a harsh environment, national capital could only struggle to survive by applying various old-fashioned business methods, such as colluding with the government, speculation and profiteering, relying on inflation, and freely seizing the market. It was very difficult for legitimate industrialists and merchants to survive. As a result, some congenital shortcomings of Chinese industrialists and merchants were formed.

    Since the unified financial and economic work and the effort to achieve a balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, these shortcomings and weaknesses have been clearly exposed. As a result, some enterprises that were not beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and undertakings that served the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, collapsed one after another, forming the particularly depressed situation nationwide this time. Just like a person suffering from a severe poisonous sore, after being cut by a doctor, although the bleeding is a bit more, and the poisonous sore is cut off, the body obviously feels weaker. In fact, this is a sign of "bad things turning into good things." This time, the central government's call for adjusting industry and commerce is a further natural and inevitable development after the unified financial and economic policy. It is like giving a patient who has undergone surgery conditioning and nourishment so they can restore normal health, which is natural and inevitable.

    Some people think that adjusting industry and commerce means changing or revising the unified financial and economic work to achieve a balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure. This view is incorrect. This is not a change or revision, but the inevitable development of the previous policy. Only by correctly and firmly implementing this policy can China fundamentally reverse from a colonial-type economy and implement the new democratic economic transformation. Even if there are no deviations or errors in the implementation of this policy, some industries and businesses will still be defeated and eliminated. Today, we can only say that, in terms of implementation techniques, due to some local and individual deviations and errors, legitimate industries and businesses have also been affected to some extent, and necessary adjustments should be made.

    China's industry and commerce have now entered a new stage. In the future, the government and the people must actively and consciously grasp the development trend of the new democratic economy, that is, fully pay attention to the mutual benefit of public and private sectors and the balance between production and sales.

    II.
    In the relationship between the public and private sectors in light industry, there are three issues worth studying, namely, the proportion of public and private sectors, leadership, and adjustment.

    (1) The proportion of public and private sectors. In terms of light industry, the private sector dominates. Here are four important light industries as examples:

              Papermaking        Leather Making          Matches           Rubber
              Public Private    Public Private       Public  Private    Public  Private
    Number of Factories  27%    73%       0.5%    99.5%       8%    92%       4%     96%
    Number of Employees  56%    44%       13%     87%        23%   77%       23%    77%
    Main Equipment     43%    57%       16%     84%        11%   89%       16%    84%
    Production Capacity  56%    44%       13%     87%        24%   76%       Tires 64%   36%
                                                                         Rickshaw Tires 43% 57%
                                                                         Rubber Shoes 10%  90%
    In these four industries, except for the papermaking industry, where the public sector has a slight advantage, the private sector accounts for more than 80%. Many light industries have no public factories at all. Chairman Mao said: "Due to the backwardness of China's economy, the capitalist economy represented by the broad petty bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie must be allowed to exist for a long time even after the victory of the revolution throughout the country. According to the division of labor of the national economy, all parts of them that are beneficial to the national economy need to be developed. They are still an indispensable part of the entire national economy" ("The Current Situation and Our Tasks"). Especially in light industry, the position of private industry is still a very important part. Therefore, it is impossible and unnecessary for public light industry to overwhelm private light industry at this stage.

    (2) The leadership of public and private sectors. Although public light industry accounts for a small number in terms of quantity, it still occupies an important position. This is because: ① Public enterprises are under the leadership of the People's Government and are carrying out the transformation of enterprises, such as democratic management, business enterprise, and planned production, which will fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist economy. ② Public enterprises are not simply aimed at pursuing profits. They will become a stabilizing force in this industry, and thus may take care of other legitimately operating private industries, so that they will no longer be manipulated and used by speculators. ③ Public enterprises are coordinated with other public and private economies under the overall economic construction plan. Therefore, their operation and development will not be blind. Only by coordinating the production and sales of public and private industries can production be more planned and less blind.

    Some people think that since the development of private capital is recognized in the new democratic economy, it should be subject to the laws of capitalist development and adopt the method of free competition, survival of the fittest. The organization and leading role of the public economy are contradictory to free competition. This will restrict the development of "progressive" capitalism and reward backward management. This view is also incorrect. Public enterprises are not afraid of free competition on an equal footing. The socialist economy has its invincible superiority over the capitalist economy. The problem is that China's economy is backward. For private capital with relatively small power, the method of large enterprises swallowing small ones cannot be used to eliminate and merge them. Instead, private capital must be given the opportunity to transform and improve itself under the leadership and care of the state-owned economy to meet social needs. This is precisely the difference between new democracy and old democracy, and it also illustrates the necessity of the leadership of public enterprises and the necessity of mutual benefit between public and private sectors.

    (3) The adjustment of public and private sectors. The superiority of the new democratic economy lies in its organization and leadership, rather than the mergers and monopolies of the old democracy. Any aspect of public and private industries must cooperate with each other and obey the plan and direction of the entire economic construction, and carry out adjustments step by step:

    In terms of regional distribution, the adjustment should be centered on "close to raw materials and close to sales areas." In the past, the distribution of industry was colonial-type, concentrated in major coastal cities, forming today's bloatedness and difficulties. In the future, under the advocacy of the government, a reasonable regional distribution should be gradually made, guiding the direction and location of factory relocation and construction.

    In terms of urban-rural relations, the adjustment should be centered on "serving the rural areas and serving the people." In the past, most industries served urban residents. Except for cotton textiles, very few products were for farmers' needs, so that they felt the decline of purchasing power and the shrinking of the market due to the trend of urban residents towards simplicity. In the future, under the advocacy of public industry, the vast rural market should be gradually expanded to adapt to the increasing needs of farmers and adjust the relationship between urban and rural areas.

    In terms of raw material supply, the adjustment should be centered on "self-sufficiency." In the past, the raw materials necessary for industry, especially chemical raw materials, mostly relied on the supply of imperialism. As a result, they were often manipulated by foreign firms and compradores. In the future, under the leadership of public industry, its own raw material industry should be gradually established, and rational control and distribution should be made, so that both public and private enterprises can develop steadily without being monopolized and manipulated by a few capitalists.

    In terms of the interrelationship of various industries, the adjustment should be centered on "simultaneous advancement and mutual cooperation." In the past, industrial development was unbalanced. Some were too much, such as the equipment of the cigarette and match industries, which exceeded the required amount by more than double. Some were insufficient, such as the pulping equipment in the papermaking industry, the tire-making equipment in the rubber industry, and some were simply not available, such as the equipment for making photographic materials and special paper, but the demand was considerable. In the future, under the leadership of the government, after more accurate investigation and research, the correct figures of various needs should be estimated, and private capital should be encouraged to develop towards the insufficient and unavailable parts, in order to achieve mutual cooperation in the entire national economy. Only in this way can "various social economic components cooperate under the leadership of the state-owned economy and each get what they deserve." Only then can we "strive to formulate a general plan for the restoration and development of major sectors of the national public and private economy as soon as possible."

    III.
    In the production and sales relationship of light industry, there are also three issues, namely, expanding the market, sales methods, and price management, which are worth studying.

    (1) Expanding the market. In the past, China was a market for dumping imperialist goods and also an object of raw material plunder. Now that imperialism has been driven out, the Chinese market should belong to itself. However, "we still have imperialism standing by. This enemy is very vicious. It will take a long time for China to achieve true economic independence. Only when China's industry develops and China is no longer economically dependent on foreign countries can it have complete and true independence." (Mao Zedong on People's Democratic Dictatorship) In fact, we have not managed and used our own market well. Some things, such as chemical raw materials and special metals and their products, still rely on foreign supply. This gap is worth the effort of private capital to develop. Secondly, China's rural areas are still a virgin land for industrial products. After the land reform in rural areas, its possible needs and development are obvious. A country with nearly 500 million people is a vast world. We do not worry about not having a market or room for development, but in light industry, there are several industries, such as matches, that do have excess capacity. For example, the papermaking industry cannot be maintained because it is oppressed by imported paper. These phenomena are temporary. Because there was no organization and leadership in the past, the industry developed and competed blindly. Encountering some difficulties, such as the match industry, after this national match conference, correctly estimated the actual needs. If the production plan and rational distribution can be strictly implemented, and necessary adjustments can be made when necessary, the situation of production and sales imbalance will not occur again. Various other major daily necessities will convene various professional meetings to seek coordination of production and sales. This is the most specific and effective step in adjusting industry and commerce, and it is also a necessary process towards a planned economy. Of course, in these production and sales adjustment work, many difficulties will occur, such as individual capitalists who want to take the name of "effectively reducing production" and attempt to lay off a large number of workers, which may cause difficulties in adjusting labor-capital relations, and want to use the method of monopolizing raw materials to squeeze out small and medium-sized manufacturers. Therefore, the correct adjustment of production and sales must have the strong leadership of the government. Only in this way can production be organized correctly, can rational distribution be implemented, can market prices be adjusted, and can the interests of producers and consumers be effectively protected. This precisely explains why the government must strengthen the leadership of the state-owned economy in the new democratic economy.

    (2) Sales methods. In the past, the sales method was free competition. In the future, it should be rational distribution. In professional meetings, we feel that there are two biases. When products are unsalable, private capitalists mostly require the Ministry of Trade to purchase and sell them in a unified way. In this way, they can avoid the risk of being unable to sell them. When production and sales are balanced or supply exceeds demand, they do not want state-owned trade institutions to intervene, so that they can freely control the supply and demand of the market in order to seek more profits. This idea fully illustrates that private capitalists only aim at pursuing more profits. This again illustrates that the new democratic economy must be rationally developed under the leadership of the state-owned economy.

    (3) Price management. After the production and sales of various enterprises are adjusted, how to manage market prices is the central issue in the relationship between public and private sectors in the future. In various professional meetings of light industry, they want to base on the standards of medium-sized factories with reasonable management, and set the specifications of products and the consumption standards of raw materials, as the scale for reviewing the prices of products in various places, to measure the reasonable prices of certain products, to control the supply and demand of the market, and to detect whether there are speculative acts of speculation and hoarding. Because it is not yet possible to implement comprehensive and rational distribution, only necessary statistics and supervision are given to major daily necessities. Through the appropriate application of these specifications and standards, it is possible to achieve mutual benefit between public and private sectors and balance between production and sales.

    In short, during the period of reactionary rule, the ruling class implemented not public-private consideration, but using public office for private gain. The balance between production and sales was not completed by organization and leadership, but was left to its own devices, taking the route of mergers and monopolies. Under the guidance of the new democratic economic policy, public-private consideration must be implemented to achieve a balance between production and sales. At the same time, public enterprises, in addition to their own interests, must also take care of the interests of private enterprises and the majority of the people (consumers). Therefore, to truly implement the balance between production and sales, the organization and leadership of the state-owned economy must be strengthened.

　　工业中的公私兼顾和产销平衡问题
    王新元
    一
    调整工商业的主要内容，就是调整公私关系，和产销关系，做到公私兼顾，和产销平衡。在反动派统治时期，中国的工商业，是按照殖民地型的资本主义的规律发展的。在那时候，以四大家族为首的官僚资产阶级，勾结或依托于帝国主义的势力，对中国的民族资本实行“兼并”，对产销实行“垄断”。民族资本处于这样恶劣的环境中，也只能按照殖民地资本主义发展的规律，应用各种旧式经营的方式，如勾结官府，投机倒把，依赖通货膨胀，自由抢夺市场等，来挣扎支持。而正当的工商业者，是很难维持的。因此，形成了中国工商业者一些先天的缺点。
    自统一财经工作，争取财政收支平衡以后，这些缺点和弱点，就显明的暴露出来。以致一些无利于国计民生的企业，为官僚资产阶级服务的事业，纷纷垮台，形成这次全国性的特别萧条的局面。正如患着一个沉重的毒疮的人，经过大夫的割治以后，因为流血稍多，毒疮虽然割下来了，可是身体也显然觉得更为虚弱，其实这正是“否极泰来”的征象，这次中央号召的调整工商业，也正是统一财经政策后进一步的自然而必然的发展，好像对一个施行手术的病人，加以调养和滋补，使其恢复正常的健康，是自然而必然的一样。
    有些人以为：调整工商业，就是改变或者修正了统一财经工作争取财政收支平衡，这种看法是不对的，这不是改变和修正，而是前一政策的必然发展，只有正确的坚定的执行了这一政策，才有可能把中国从殖民地型的经济，基本上扭转过来，实行新民主主义的经济改造。即令在执行这一政策的过程中，没有任何一点偏差和错误，也必然还是有一些工商业，是要被打倒被淘汰的。今天只可以说，在执行的技术上，因为有了一些局部的个别的偏差和错误，使正当的工商业也受了一些影响，应该予以必要的调整。
    现在的中国工商业，已经走上了一个新的阶段，政府和人民，今后都必须主动的自觉的掌握新民主主义经济发展的动向，即充分的注意公私兼顾与产销平衡。
    二
    轻工业的公私关系中，有三个问题，值得提出来研究的，就是公私的比重，领导和调整问题。
    （１）公私的比重问题，在轻工业方面，私营的占着优势，兹举四种重要的轻工业为例：
        造纸             制革                火柴             橡胶
        公营    私营     公营    私营        公营   私营     公营    私营厂数    二七％  七三％  ○·五％ 九九·五％  八％   九二％ 四％    九六％职工人数 五六％  四四％  一三％  八七％      二三％  七七％   二三％  七七％主要设备 四三％  五七％  一六％  八四％      一一％  八九％   一六％  八四％生产能力 五六％  四四％  一三％  八七％      二四％  七六％   车胎六四％  三六％人力车胎 四三％  五七％   胶鞋一○％  九○％
    这四种工业，除造纸事业，公营稍占优势外，私营均占百分之八十以上。有许多轻工业，还完全没有公营工厂。毛主席说：“由于中国经济的落后性，广大的小资产阶级与中等资产阶级所代表的资本主义经济，即使革命在全国胜利以后，在一个长时期内，还是必须允许他们存在，并且按国民经济的分工，还需要他们中一切有益于国民经济部分，有一个发展，他们在整个国民经济中，还是不可缺少的部分”（目前形势和我们的任务）。特别在轻工业中，私营工业的地位，还是很重要的一部分。所以公营轻工业，现在不可能也不必要压倒私营的轻工业。
    （２）公私的领导问题。公营轻工业，在数量上，虽然还占少数，但仍然占有重要地位。这是因为：①公营企业在人民政府的领导下，正在实行企业的改造，如管理的民主化，经营的企业化，生产的计划化，将充分表现出社会主义性质经济的优越性。②公营企业，不是单纯以追逐利润为目的，他将成为这一事业的安定力量，因而可能照顾其他正当经营的私营工业，不致再受投机倒把者的操纵和利用。③公营企业，是在整个经济建设计划之下，与其它公私经济互相配合的。因此他的经营和发展，不致发生盲目现象，只有统筹公营私营工业的生产与运销，才有可能使生产增加计划性，减少盲目性。
    有些人以为：在新民主主义经济中，既然承认私人资本的发展，就应该服从于资本主义发展的规律，采取自由竞争，优胜劣败的方法来处理。公营经济的组织与领导作用，是与自由竞争相矛盾的，这样会限制了“进步的”资本主义的发展，奖励了落后的经营。这种观点，也是不正确的。公营企业，在平等的基础上，是不怕自由竞争的。社会主义性质的经济，比资本主义的经济，有其不可战胜的优越性。问题在于中国经济的落后，对于力量比较小的私营资本，不能用大吃小的方法来淘汰与兼并。而必须在国营经济的领导与照顾之下，使私营资本有机会来改造和提高自己，以适合社会的需要。这正是新民主主义与旧民主主义的差别，也说明公营企业领导的必要性，和公私兼顾的必要性。
    （３）公私的调整问题。新民主主义经济的优越，在于有组织有领导。而非旧民主主义的兼并与垄断。公私营工业的任何一方面，都必须互相配合，同时服从于整个经济建设的计划与方向，有步骤地进行调整：
    在地区分布上，应该是以“就原料就销场”为中心来调整。过去工业的分布，是殖民地型的，集中于沿海各大都市，形成今日的臃肿和困难。今后应该是在政府的倡导之下，逐渐作合理的地域上的分配，指导迁厂建厂的方向与地点。
    在城乡关系上，应该以“面向农村为人民服务”为中心来调整。过去的工业，大多数是为城市居民服务的。除棉织品外，很少生产是为农民所需用的东西，以致因为城市居民的趋向朴素，而感到购买力的降落，和市场的萎缩。今后应该在公营工业的倡导下，逐渐扩大农村的广大市场，以适应日益提高的农民需要，调整城乡的关系。
    在原料供应上，应该以“自给自足”为中心来调整。过去工业必需的原料，尤其是化学工业原料，大多数是依赖帝国主义来供给。以致常受洋行买办的操纵。今后应该在公营工业的领导下，逐渐建立自己的原料工业，作合理的掌握与分配，使公私营企业，都能够稳步的发展，不致受少数资本家的垄断与操纵。
    在各种工业的相互关系上，应该以“齐头并进互相配合”为中心来调整。过去的工业发展，是不平衡的。有的过多，如卷烟业火柴业的设备，都超过需要量的一倍以上。有的不足，如造纸业的制浆设备，橡胶业的制车胎设备，有的根本没有，如制照像材料和特种纸的设备，但是需要量是相当大的。今后应该在政府的领导下，经过比较正确的调查研究，估计各种需要量的正确数字，鼓励私营资本，向不足和没有的部分发展，以谋整个国民经济的相互配合。这样才能“使各种社会经济成份，在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所。”才能“争取早日制定恢复和发展全国公私经济各主要部门的总计划。”
    三
    轻工业产销关系中，也有三个问题，就是扩大市场推销方法和价格管理的问题，值得提出来研究的。
    （１）扩大市场问题，过去中国是帝国主义商品倾销的市场，也是掠夺原料的对象。现在帝国主义被驱逐出去了，中国的市场，应该是属于自己的。可是“我们还有帝国主义站在旁边，这个敌人是很凶恶的，中国要实现经济上的真正独立，还需要经过很长的时间，只有中国工业发展了。中国在经济上不依赖外国了，才有全部的真正的独立。”（毛主席论人民民主专政）事实上，我们对于自己的市场，还没有很好的管理和运用。有些东西，如化工原料和特种金属及其制品，还依赖外国的供给。这一空白，是值得私营资本来努力发展的。其次中国的农村，对于工业品还是一个处女地，农村经过土改以后，其可能的需要与发展是很明显的，将近五亿人口的国家，是一个天宽地阔的世界。我们不愁没有市场，没有发展的余地，但是在轻工业中，有几种工业，如火柴，确实有过剩的现象。如造纸，因为受着进口纸张的压迫而至不能维持。这种现象，都是暂时的。因为过去没有组织和领导，使工业在盲目中发展和竞争。遭到一些困难，如火柴工业，经过这次全国火柴会议以后，正确的估计实际需要量，如果能够严格的执行生产计划，与合理的分配，必要时再加以调整，就不会再发生产销不调的事情。其他各种主要的民生日用品，都将召集各种专业会议，以谋产销的协调，这是调整工商业最具体有效的步骤，也是走向计划经济的必要过程。当然在这些调整产销的工作中，会发生很多困难，如个别资本家，要想利用“切实减产”的名义，企图大批的裁减职工，可能使劳资关系的调整发生困难，要想利用垄断原料的方法，来挤垮中小厂家，所以正确的调整产销，必须有政府强有力的领导，这样才能正确的组织生产，才能实行合理的分配，才能调整市场的价格，才能有效的保护生产者和消费者的利益。这正是说明了为什么在新民主主义的经济中，政府必然要加强国营经济的领导。
    （２）推销方法问题，过去的推销方法，是自由竞争。今后应该是合理的分配。在专业会议中，我们感觉到有两种偏向，在产品滞销的时候，私营资本家多半是要求由贸易部统购统销。这样他可以不负担推销不出去的风险。在产销平衡或供不应求的时候，又不希望国营的贸易机构来伸手，这样他可以自由的控制市场的供求，以谋取更多的利润。这种想法，充分说明，私营资本家是以追逐更多利润为他唯一的目标。这又是说明新民主主义的经济，必须在国营经济领导之下，才能合理发展。
    （３）价格的管理问题。各企业的产销，经过调整以后，如何管理市场的价格，是今后公私关系中的中心问题。在轻工业的各种专业会议中，都想以合理经营的中等工厂的标准为根据，定出制品的规格，和原材料的消耗标准来，以为审核各地制品价格的尺度，来测量某种制品的合理价格，以管制市场的供求。探测是否有投机倒把垄断居奇的行动。因为现在还不可能实行全面的合理分配，只是对于主要的民生日用必需品，予以必要的统计和监督。经过这些规格和标准的适当运用，是可以达到公私兼顾和产销平衡的。
    总之，在反动派统治时期，统治阶级实行的，不是公私兼顾，而是假公济私。产销平衡，也不是由组织和领导来完成，而是任其自流，采取兼并和垄断的路线。在新民主主义经济政策指导下，必须贯彻公私兼顾，以达到产销平衡。同时公营企业，除了本身的利益以外，还要照顾私营企业和大多数人民（消费者）的利益，所以要真正实行产销平衡，必须加强国营经济的组织和领导。
