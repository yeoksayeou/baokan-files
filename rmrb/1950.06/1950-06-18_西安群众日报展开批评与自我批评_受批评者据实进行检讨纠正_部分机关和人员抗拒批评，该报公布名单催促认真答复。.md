Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 14th: The Xi'an Masses Daily, based on the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," has actively launched criticism and self-criticism in its pages. In the month from May 10th to June 10th, the newspaper successively published 46 critical reports and letters, exposing the bureaucratic and illegal, corrupt behavior existing in certain departments. These reports and letters have aroused widespread and positive reactions in society. Some of the criticized agencies or individuals have conducted self-examination and correction based on the facts. For example, after the Xi'an Telecommunications Bureau was reported for illegally hoarding 2,000 bags of flour with business funds, and some of the flour had become moldy due to poor storage, the person in charge of the bureau made a public self-criticism in the newspaper. Li Fenglai, factory director of the Third Factory of the Ordnance Department of the Northwest Military Region, did not implement correct instructions from higher authorities, did not adopt reasonable suggestions from workers, and continuously manufactured 4,000 unusable mattocks, resulting in a loss of more than 200 million RMB; Yang Zhengyuan, chief of the Ordnance Section of the department, under the lure of petty favors from merchants, caused the state to lose 81.5 million RMB in the purchase of materials. After these two incidents were reported in the newspaper, the CCP Committee of the department conducted continuous self-examinations and is currently drafting handling measures. Readers' letters revealed that Su Yunzhang, head of the Ninth Township in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, used his position to engage in favoritism and malpractice. After investigation, the county people's government has given Su Yunzhang the punishment of dismissal. People from all walks of life have unanimously expressed praise and support for this spirit of correct critical reporting and the criticized promptly correcting their behavior based on factual self-examination. Zhao Yukun, a worker at the Dahua Cotton Mill, wrote in a letter to the newspaper: We are all very excited to hear or see the news of the newspaper launching criticism. This is precisely where our own newspaper is fundamentally different from the reactionary newspapers of the Kuomintang.

In the process of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, the newspaper has not been without encountering resistance. Some of the criticized agencies or personnel refused to accept criticism on the pretext of discrepancies in individual figures or dates, and some even treated the reporters who raised the criticism with a rude attitude. Many of those criticized have resisted by ignoring the criticisms raised in the newspaper. Of the 512 letters that the newspaper forwarded to relevant agencies in April and May, 30 percent have not yet been answered. Readers of the newspaper, especially the working people, have put forward many opinions on this bureaucratic style of not listening to the opinions of the masses, demanding that the criticized agencies or individuals quickly express their attitude publicly in the newspaper. On the 9th of this month, the newspaper published a list of nine criticized agencies that had been repeatedly urged but had not replied, demanding that they seriously answer the criticisms raised with an attitude of loyalty and responsibility to the Party and the people.

　　西安群众日报展开批评与自我批评
    受批评者据实进行检讨纠正
    部分机关和人员抗拒批评，该报公布名单催促认真答复。
    【新华社西安十四日电】西安群众日报已根据中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，积极地在报上展开批评和自我批评。在五月十日到六月十日的一个月内，该报曾先后发表了四十六篇批评性的报道和来信，揭发了某些部门中存在的官僚主义和违法贪污的行为。这些报道或来信，在社会上已引起普遍的、良好的反应。部分被批评的机关或个人，已据实进行检讨和纠正。例如西安电信局以事业费违法囤积二千袋面粉，并因保管不好致部分面粉发霉一事经报道后，该局负责人已在报上进行了公开检讨。西北军区军械部第三厂厂长李凤来不执行上级正确指示，不采纳工人合理意见，连续制造四千把不合用的洋镐，损失人民币两亿余元；该部军械科长杨正渊在商人小恩小惠的利诱下，使国家在购买物资中损失人民币八千一百五十万元，这两件事经报纸报道后，该部中共党委已连续进行检讨，并正在拟订处理办法。读者来信揭露陕西省武功县九乡乡长苏云章利用职权徇私舞弊，经调查属实后，该县人民政府已予苏云章以撤职处分。各界人民对于这种正确的批评的报道和被批评者据实检讨立即纠正的精神，均一致表示赞扬和拥护。大华纱厂工人赵玉昆在给该报的信上写道：我们听到或看到报纸上展开批评的消息，大家都感觉非常兴奋。这正是咱们自己报纸与国民党反动派报纸根本不同的地方。
    该报在开展批评和自我批评的过程中，并不是没有遭遇到抵抗的。被批评的机关或人员，有的以个别数字或日期不符作为借口，拒绝接受批评，有的甚至以蛮横的态度对待提出批评的记者，有不少被批评者对报上所提出的批评采取不加理睬的办法来抵制。该报四、五两月中所转给有关机关的五百一十二封来信中，现在尚有百分之三十没有得到答复。该报读者特别是劳动人民对于这种不听取群众意见的官僚主义作风，曾纷纷提出意见，要求被批评的机关或个人迅速在报上公开表示态度。该报已于本月九日将数催不复的九个被批评机关的名单公布，要求他们必须以对党对人民忠诚负责的态度，认真答复所提出的批评。
