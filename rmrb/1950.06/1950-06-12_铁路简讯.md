    Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau: Youth League Members Take the Lead in Setting New Records

    In the Red May competition, Youth League members from various units of the Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau took the lead in setting new records. Zhi Diguo, a Youth League member from the Mechanical Section of the Nankou Railway Factory, changed the reamer to a flat round drill bit, setting a new record for connecting rod oil cup covers, reducing working hours by 0.79 times compared to before. Under his influence, 22 individuals and 43 collectives in the factory achieved new records. Zhu Bingren, a Youth League member and boiler washing worker at the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot's renovation factory, invented a rust-removing tool for washing boilers, removing 36 kilograms of water rust in two hours, more than doubling work efficiency compared to the past, and saving coal and extending the life of locomotives, for which he received a material reward from the bureau. Li Guozhi, a Youth League member from the Zhangjiakou Machine Factory, modified the turning tool head and increased the lathe speed, turning 19 locomotive unloading screws in eight hours, more than doubling production compared to before. Ma Zhenjiang, the Youth League branch secretary, used to turn 12 oil pots in eight hours; now he turns 10 in four hours. Wang Defu, a Youth League member and acting foreman of the Communications Section of the Datong Electrical Affairs Office, led all workers to complete the 11-kilometer wiring project between Datong and Pingwang in 25 workdays, shortening the time required by more than half compared to the superior's requirements.

    Guye Locomotive Depot: Safe Travel of 200,000 Kilometers

    The Guye Locomotive Depot completed 200,000 kilometers of safe travel from April 19 to May 15. Before March, due to poor technical and political study, low morale among workers, and a lack of responsibility in their work, the depot had disrupted safe travel as many as 12 times due to repeated accidents. By mid-March, the restoration of the three-shift system allowed crew members to get adequate rest, and intensive study and continuous education of drivers helped to realize the slogan of 200,000 kilometers of safe travel in less than a month.

    古冶机务段  安全行走二十万公里
    古冶机务段自四月十九日至五月十五日完成安全行走二十万公里。该段在三月份以前，由于技术与政治学习不好，职工劳动情绪不高，工作不负责，致因屡次发生事故而破坏了安全行走达十二次之多。至三月中旬，由于恢复了三班制，乘务员得到正常休息，同时抓紧了学习，指导司机不断加以教育，在不到一月时间，就实现了安全走行二十万公里的口号。
