　　Zhu Lin and His "May First Model Gas Car"
　　Kefu
　　The "May First Model Gas Car" has appeared in the ranks of Beijing's public buses with a brand-new look since International Labor Day this year. When the country is not yet producing gasoline in large quantities, this new creation saves more than 53% of the cost compared with the original wood charcoal fuel and more than 26% of the cost compared with wood fuel; lubricating oil can also be saved by one-quarter to one-half; and it has greater horsepower and is not as prone to erode the machine as wood charcoal, which greatly contributes to the development of the automobile transportation industry.
　　The "May First Model Gas Car" was invented by Zhu Lin, deputy director and engineer of the Beijing Public Bus Company Repair Factory, with the help of workers. Zhu Lin is a young and hardworking engineer, 31 years old this year. He specializes in automobile repair work and loves this work. He has spent a lot of effort in in-depth research and hard self-study in this work: As early as 1936, when he had just graduated from junior high school and was in charge of accounts at the Jiangsu Highway Bureau Repair Factory, he secretly learned technology and drove cars with his workmates. After the Anti-Japanese War, he was transferred to the Southwest Highway Bureau. Because of the lack of technicians, he became a "machine officer." But he knew too little, and afraid that his workmates would laugh at him for being incompetent, he ran to the Northwest Highway Bureau again and became an "assistant engineer" who was much lower than the "machine officer," determined to learn from scratch.
　　After Zhu Lin learned a lot of technology, he was determined to make a career. But at that time, a "Ministry of Personnel" of the Kuomintang reactionary government suppressed all his skills. According to his junior high school background, he would be at most an engineer without power. Therefore, he had the idea of going to university again. Because he had no money, he ran to the Burma Road to find a driving job; failing that, he went to a private automobile company, and finally found a few colleagues to run a factory by himself. Under the reactionary rule, young people like Zhu Lin who only relied on hard work and had no backing from above were destined to fail. Finally, he took five months of back pay in a private automobile company, and relied on his hard-earned achievements in self-study at work to be admitted to the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Wuhan University. After graduating in 1948, he went to work at the "Capital Public Bus Company" in Nanjing at that time.
　　What made Zhu Lin focus on the improvement of charcoal vehicles? Zhu Lin said: It was entirely due to a driver who inspired him. He said: "I remember when I was still in the Northwest Highway Bureau, one day a driver named Song Dehua drove a charcoal vehicle from Hanzhong to Baocheng. Because the charcoal was wet, he asked me to change to dry charcoal. At that time, I thought it was a machine management problem, so I told Song a set of methods, but I didn't expect it to cause him to laugh and say to me: 'Young man, you are far behind.' It turned out that my set had been used by others long ago and was ineffective. This really made me ashamed. In order to save face, I worked hard on the charcoal vehicles that I had always looked down on for more than a month. I will never forget the achievements Song Dehua gave me in my life."
　　Mentioning the creation of the "May First Model Gas Car" evoked a lot of emotion in Zhu Lin. As early as during the Anti-Japanese War, he had small creations for gas vehicles, but no one paid attention. When he was in Nanjing before liberation, because the source of gasoline was small and expensive, he suggested to the company to switch to charcoal vehicles. Not only did this suggestion not receive sympathy, but on the contrary, a Mr. Li who was an assistant manager at that time firmly opposed it, saying: "That won't work, putting a stove behind the car, wouldn't it bake people dry, and what do we need gasoline for?" Until Nanjing was liberated, Mr. Li still opposed it in this way before leaving his post. Therefore, Zhu Lin had the idea of leaving again. But this time he didn't leave. On the one hand, due to the dissuasion of several friends, and on the other hand, because someone complained to the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China that his created "July First Model Charcoal Vehicle" was destroying the car, after the Nanjing Municipal Committee investigated and understood, it gave him great encouragement instead, allowing him to experience that he could only exert his skills under the Communist Party's realistic and pragmatic style.
　　As early as when he created the "July First Model Charcoal Vehicle," he had originally prepared for both coal and charcoal. Last December, Zhu Lin and a group of "July First Model Charcoal Vehicles" were transferred to Beijing to serve. Seeing that the coal source in the north was abundant, he suggested that the company replace charcoal with coal to save costs. The results of the first experiment showed that coal was better than charcoal: the cost of coal was cheaper; coal did not absorb lubricating oil like charcoal when it exploded; coal had no ash and would not be blown into the cylinder to damage the machine. But the problem also appeared here: coal would form slag, and if there was too much slag, it would block the gas absorption port; when driving slowly or stopping, the temperature in the furnace was low, and a layer of white hard film formed on the coal surface, which was not easy to burn. Due to the above defects, there was not enough gas, the car was prone to break down, and the driver had to jump down from time to time to scoop out coal slag and burn the furnace, which made driving not punctual and very troublesome. Another problem was that coal had more sulfur content, which easily eroded machine parts; coal also had more volatile matter, and there was also acidic black oil like that produced when burning wood, which often glued the valves and pistons.
　　To overcome this problem, the "July First Model Charcoal Vehicle" must be improved. When Zhu Lin went to Nanjing at the end of last year to repair another batch of cars, he looked for some reference materials, used some waste parts, and installed a "slag drop device" in the furnace of the "July First Model Charcoal Vehicle," an "electric air suction fan" in front of the "filter," and a "gas oversupply device" in the engine. In this way, the furnace door did not have to be opened to remove coal slag within sixteen hours, not only did a white film not form on the coal surface, but also sufficient gas was obtained in the cylinder, and the car would not break down halfway. In addition, the original water filter was improved to wash out the acidic sulfides in the gas, protecting the engine parts from erosion. After testing, the air intake pipe was reduced by one-third, and based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, the coal was crushed into half-centimeter pieces to increase the furnace temperature. Because of the increased horsepower, the difficulty of slow starting was overcome. In addition, an "air preheater" was installed outside the furnace, and an "automatic steam regulator" was also installed on the head of the "air intake pipe." This not only prevented the high temperature in the furnace from being affected by external cold air, but also ensured the quality of the gas and reduced the slagging of coal.
　　After breaking through this series of difficulties, the coal-fired car officially began to be manufactured on April 10. At that time, Zhu Lin and the workers specifically held a meeting to explain the machine principle and solicit the opinions of the workers. In the manufacturing process, the workers demonstrated a high degree of creativity. When Tang Gentang was making the air intake pipe, he reformed a cover on the pipe and made it very tight, which had an unexpectedly fast effect when starting the fire. In addition, the brothers Shen Er and Shen A San and the workers Yang Kaineng, etc., created new tools when manufacturing the furnace, which saved time and labor. With the close combination of the engineer's technology and the workers' strength, on International Labor Day this year, the brand-new gas car officially appeared on the streets of the capital. Car No. 135 was automatically requested to be driven by Zhang Dexuan, a technician from the overhaul shop. He told other drivers the driving experience he had learned. To commemorate the great festival of workers, they named this newly created car the "May First Model Gas Car."
　　Since the "May First Model Gas Car" was officially launched, Zhu Lin has been very busy. He gets up early and goes to bed late every day to hold meetings and talks with workers and drivers to exchange experiences and study improvement methods. For example, the furnace bars at the gas absorption port are often burned off, so he accepted the suggestion of the driver Yang Chunpu and lowered the coal fire to the bottom of the furnace after returning to the factory, so as not to burn the furnace bars; Yangquan coal is easy to form slag, so he is preparing to replace it with Kouquan coal; and he is studying to increase the furnace from 20 inches to 22 inches to increase horsepower. At the same time, because the drivers are not used to driving gas cars, Zhu Lin often drives himself for half a day or half a day to let the drivers learn.
　　Speaking of this, he patted the dirty and old yellow uniform and smiled. He told the reporter that although the clothes were not good, he loved this worker's uniform very much. Earlier in the Northwest, he was driven out for wearing such dirty and old clothes to see a director; another time he was detained by a stationmaster. This shows the fact that workers were despised under the reactionary rule. But what about now? He said: "Not only have the workers turned over, but the clothes have also turned over."

　　朱临和他的“五一式煤气车”
    柯夫
    “五一式煤气车”，自今年国际劳动节那天起，以崭新的姿态，出现在北京市公共汽车的行列里。当国内还没有大量生产汽油的时候，这个新的创造，较原用木炭燃料节省费用百分之五十三强，较木柴燃料节省费用百分之二十六强；机油也可节省四分之一到二分之一；而且马力大，也不像木炭那样容易侵蚀机器，大大有助于汽车交通事业的发展。
    “五一式煤气车”是北京公共汽车公司修理厂副厂长兼工程师朱临在工人们帮助下发明的。朱临是一个年轻努力的工程师，今年三十一岁。他专门从事于汽车修理工作，并热爱着这个工作。他曾花费了很大的心血，在这个工作中深入钻研，刻苦自学过：早在一九三六年他刚从初中毕业，在江苏公路局修理厂管账的时候，就偷偷地跟工友们学习技术，驾驶汽车。抗战后，他调到西南公路局。因为技术人员缺乏，他当了“机务员”。可是他懂得的东西太少了，怕工友们笑他滥竽充数，就又跑到西北公路局，当了一名比“机务员”低得多的“助理工务员”，下决心要从头学起。
    当朱临学会了许多技术之后，他立志要做一番事业。但是当时国民党反动政府的一个“铨叙部”，就压住了他一身本领。照他初中毕业的出身，顶到头不过是个有职无权的帮工程司。因此，他又打起了上大学的念头。因为没有钱，便跑到滇缅公路，去找开车的职位；不成，又到一家私营的汽车公司，最后找到几个同事自己搞厂子。在反动统治下，像朱临这样只凭苦挣苦干，上面没有靠山的年轻人，终归是要失败的。最后还是在一家私营汽车公司，拿了五个月的欠薪，仗着自己在工作中苦学自修的成绩，考进了武汉大学机械工程系。一九四八年毕业以后，他到了当时南京的“首都公共汽车公司”去做事。
    什么原因使朱临专心于木炭车的改进工作？朱临说：完全是由于一个司机激发了他。他说：“记得我还在西北公路局的时候，有一天一个名叫宋德华的司机，从汉中开一辆木炭车到褒城。因为木炭湿，找我换干木炭。当时我认为这是机器管理问题，就告诉宋一套办法，可是没想到会引起他一阵大笑，对我说：‘小伙子，你还差得远呢。’原来我那一套人家早用过了，是不起作用的。这真使我羞愧难当。我为了争一口气，就对一向瞧不起的木炭车，下苦工夫钻研了一个多月。我一辈子也忘不了宋德华给我的成就。”
    提起了“五一式煤气车”的创造，引起朱临一番感慨。早在抗日时期他对煤气车就有了小的创造，但是并没人理会。当解放前他在南京的时候，因为汽油来源少而贵，他曾向公司建议改用木炭车。这建议不但没有得到同情，相反的，当时一个姓李的协理还坚决反对说：“那还行，汽车后面装个炉子，岂不要把人烤干了，而且还要汽油作什么？”直到南京解放，李某在离职以前，还是这样反对。因此使朱临又萌生了要走的念头。可是这次他没走成。一方面由于几个朋友的劝阻，另一方面是因为有人向中共南京市委控告他创造的“七一式木炭车”是破坏汽车，当南京市委调查明白之后，反而给了他很大的鼓励，使他体验到只有在共产党实事求是的作风下，才能发挥自己的技能。
    早在他创造的“七一式木炭车”时，原就准备煤炭两用。去年十二月，朱临和一部分“七一式木炭车”调到北京来服务。他看到北方煤源畅旺，就建议公司以燃煤代木炭，节省成本。第一次试验的结果，发现煤比木炭好：煤的成本便宜；煤在爆发时，不像木炭那样吸收机油；煤没有灰，不会被吹到汽缸里去损坏机器。可是毛病也出在这里：煤会结渣，渣多了就挡住了煤气的吸收口；走慢车或停车时，炉中温度低，煤面上结了一层白色硬膜，不易燃烧。由于以上缺陷，煤气不够用，车子爱抛锚，司机得时常跳下来去掏煤渣，烧炉子，使行车不能正点，而且很麻烦。另一个毛病，就是煤中硫质较多，容易侵蚀机件；煤的挥发物质也多，也有如烧木柴时所发生的酸性黑油，往往胶住了汽门和活塞。
    要克服这毛病，就必须把“七一式木炭车”加以改良。当朱临去年年底到南京去修理另一批汽车时，他就找了些参考资料，利用些废零件，在“七一式木炭车”的炉子里按了个“溶渣降落器”，在“滤清器”前面，装了个“电动吸风机”，在引擎里，又装了个“气体过供器”。这样，车子在十六小时以内，就不必打开炉门取煤渣，煤面上不但不结白膜，汽缸内也得到了充足煤气，车子不致中途抛锚。另外，还将原用的水滤清器加以改进，洗涤了煤气中的酸性硫化物，保护了引擎机件不受侵蚀。经过试验后，又将进风管缩小三分，并接受苏联专家建议，把煤砸成半公分小块，以增强炉温。由于马力大了，就克服了起步时迟慢的困难。此外在炉外又装了个“空气预热器”，在“进风管”头上，也装了个“水蒸气自动调节器”，这样，不但使炉内高温不致为外来的冷空气所影响，而且保证了煤气的质量好，又减少了煤的结渣。
    突破了这一连串困难之后，以煤代炭的汽车，自四月十日开始正式制造。当时朱临和工人们专门开了个会，讲明机器原理，并征询工人们的意见。在制造过程中，工人们发挥了高度的创造性。唐根堂在造进风管的时候，把管上的一个盖子，加以改革，做得非常严密，在生火时，收到了意外快的效果。另外沈耳、沈阿三兄弟俩和杨开能等工友，在制造炉子时，都创造了新的工具，又省时，又省工。在工程师的技术和工人的力量紧密地结合下，今年国际劳动节那天，崭新的煤气车，就正式出现在首都街头。其中一三五号车子，还是大修间的技工张德宣自动要求驾驶的，他把他所体验到的驾驶经验，告诉给其他的司机们。为纪念工人的伟大节日，他们就将这种新创造的车子，命名为“五一式煤气车”。
    自从“五一式煤气车”正式开驶以后，可把朱临忙坏了。他每天起早爬晚的找工友和司机们开会、谈话，交流经验，研究改进办法。其中如煤气吸收口的炉条常被烧断，就接受了司机杨春圃的建议，回厂后把煤火降到炉底，不烧炉条；阳泉煤容易结渣，就准备换用口泉煤；并研究把炉子由二十英寸加大到二十二英寸，以增强马力。同时，因为司机们不习惯开煤气车，朱临就往往半天、半天的亲自驾驶，让司机们学习。
    说到这里，他拍拍脏而旧的黄制服笑了。他告诉记者：别看衣服不好，他是很爱这身工人服装的。早先在西北时，曾因穿着这样脏而旧的衣服去见一个主任，被哄了出来；又一次还被一个站长给扣押了一次。这都说明了反动统治下鄙视工人的事实。但是现在呢？他说：“不但工人翻了身，而且衣服也跟着翻身了。”（京市新闻处讯）
