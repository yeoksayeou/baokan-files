　　Qingdao Rolling Stock Inspection Depot Convenes Workers' Representatives Conference
　　The Qingdao Railway Station Rolling Stock Inspection Depot, after prior deliberation and discussion to dispel the workers' fear of expressing opinions, convened a conference of worker representatives on May 21. The director and deputy director of the depot both delivered reports at the meeting, making self-criticisms of their past bureaucratic style of being detached from the masses, and the resulting losses in work. Each case was handled accordingly. Those that could be resolved were immediately handed over to the relevant departments for resolution, and those that could not be resolved were reserved for later handling. As a result, the representatives' confidence was generally increased, and they unanimously expressed their determination to implement the resolutions of the conference and ensure their execution.

　　Yongnian Mechanized Reclamation Farm Harvests 10,000 Mu of Wheat
　　Since the spring plowing, the Yongnian Mechanized Reclamation Branch of the state-owned Jiheng Farm has planted hemp on 6,000 mu of wasteland that had not been cultivated for more than ten years. It is harvesting 10,000 mu of wheat in Jixian's "Qianqingwa".

　　Chabei Mechanized Reclamation Farm Sows Over 10,000 Mu of Wheat

　　State-owned Huaibei Salt Field Enters Peak Sweeping Season
　　The state-owned Huaibei Salt Field in northern Jiangsu has entered a period of full-scale sweeping. The field began spring sweeping in late March, and so far, in more than two months, it has produced nearly two million dan of salt, with a significant improvement in salt quality. According to statistics at the end of May, the top-grade white salt suitable for chemical industrial raw materials accounted for 95.4% of the total output, with a sodium chloride content of 90.15% (compared to 85% last year); second-grade white salt accounted for 4.6% of the total output, with a sodium chloride content of 84.18%.

　　Dagu and Other Public Salt Fields Produce One Million Dan of Salt in Spring Drying
　　The public salt fields in Dagu, Xinhe, Denggu, Hangu, and other places under the Changlu Salt Affairs Administration produced 1.15 million dan of salt in the spring drying season, setting a new record for salt quality in more than ten years. The salt produced by each field has large and white grains, and the sodium chloride content is generally above 92% (compared to less than 90% last year), with the highest reaching over 95%. The improvement in salt quality is mainly due to the fact that the administrative and trade union leadership of the salt field management office extensively solicited opinions on improving technology before the spring drying season. The management office also formulated a progressive bonus system for exceeding quotas and a reward system for improving quality. The production enthusiasm of the salt workers has been greatly increased, and there has been a significant improvement in technology.

　　When Remnant Bandits Occupied Daishan Island, They Massively Destroyed the Local Salt Fields
　　Before fleeing from Daishan Island in the Zhoushan Islands, the Kuomintang remnant bandits completely destroyed the island's salt fields. Daishan Island is located north of Zhoushan Island and is one of the most famous salt fields in the country. The island has a population of 60,000, with over 40,000 salt workers. After the Kuomintang remnant bandits scurried to the island last year, they completely destroyed over 1,300 mu of the best salt fields south of Daitou Town to build an airport. The salt boards used for supporting the salt were dismantled and used to build bunkers, as paving slabs, and even as firewood. The salt boards in the major salt fields such as Zupu Township, Yaoxingpu, and Beinizui along the coast were almost completely destroyed. After the liberation of Daishan, the salt workers, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, have begun to dismantle the salt boards from the bunker fortifications, reorganize the abandoned salt fields, and actively engage in restoring production.

　　Fishing Boats Detained by Remnant Bandits in Zhoushan: Military Control Commission Actively Registers and Returns Them
　　The Zhoushan Islands Military Control Commission is vigorously handling the large number of fishing boats detained by the Chiang bandits, so that fishermen can go to sea to fish in a timely manner during the fishing season. Since the remnant bandits fled from the mainland to the islands in May last year, they have massively used fishing boats and intercepted a large number of merchant ships to and from. After the liberation of Zhoushan, the Military Control Commission, in view of the current fishing season and the fishermen's eagerness to go to sea to fish, organized a ship handling committee to go to Shenjiamen and Daishan to carry out the handling work. As of June 1, in Shenjiamen alone, more than 440 fishing boats have been registered and returned.

　　Shandong Aquatic Products Company Convenes Business Meeting of Fisheries Institutions
　　From January to May 20 this year, the total amount of aquatic products obtained in the thirteen fishing areas of Qingdao, Yantai, Shidao, Yangjiaogou, Xinhai, Changdao Island, and other places in Shandong has reached 89,126,971 jin. In order to safeguard the interests of fishermen, Shandong Aquatic Products Company specially convened a business meeting of its subordinate fishery institutions from June 1 to 3 to discuss and formulate plans for procurement, processing, transportation, and sales, as well as interim measures for aquatic product consignment business.
