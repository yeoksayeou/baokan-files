Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: The Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference unanimously passed today the "Measures of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for Calling on the People to Launch a Signature Campaign to Defend World Peace." The full text of the measures is as follows:

　　Peaceful construction is the main factor for human happiness. All progressive people in the world value peace and hope that construction work can be guaranteed to enhance common happiness.

　　In our country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, after a long and arduous struggle, we have broken the shackles of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism and won basic peace. We are making great efforts to restore and develop various constructions, and we feel peace is especially precious.

　　But today, the imperialist aggressive bloc, in order to satisfy the greedy desires of a very few people and to save the declining crisis of imperialism, has reorganized the war after the Second World War, frantically expanded military bases, engaged in an arms race, and supported reactionary forces, attempting to enslave all progressive people in the world. World peace is significantly threatened.

　　In particular, the use of atomic energy is an issue that cannot be ignored. The discovery and use of atomic energy was originally the highest achievement of human culture, but before it could be used for production and construction, it was unfortunately used as a weapon for mass murder and fell into the hands of aggressors. The aggressors are exaggerating the power of this weapon and constantly threatening the safety of all mankind.

　　To this end, the World Peace Congress issued a declaration at the Stockholm meeting in mid-March:

　　"Demanding an unconditional ban on atomic weapons of mass destruction and requiring the establishment of strict international control to ensure the implementation of this resolution."

　　"Any government that first uses atomic weapons against any country commits a crime against humanity and should be treated as a war criminal."

　　The Stockholm meeting further "called on all good people around the world to sign this declaration." This is a very timely and effective campaign, and this conference expresses its complete acceptance and has unanimously carried out the task of signing.

　　The signature campaign has been launched worldwide and has received extremely warm support. For example, in the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the signature achievements account for about 80% of the total population. This proves the urgency of mankind's love for peace and that the strength of the peace camp cannot be underestimated. The strength of the peace camp increases by one point, and the scruples of the warmongers increase by one point. If the strength of the peace camp can continue to increase, the crisis of war can be prevented, and the use of atomic energy can be gradually guided to serve peaceful construction, just like the Soviet Union.

　　Our country should actively show our strength in striving for peace and defending peace. The Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, in response to the call of the Stockholm meeting, issued instructions to its branches in various places on April 28: to launch a signature campaign throughout the country. However, due to China's vast territory and large population, it has not been widely launched for a while. The committee recently suggested to this conference, requesting this conference to call on the people of the country to further launch a signature campaign to defend world peace. This conference accepted this suggestion and formulated the following measures, hoping that the people of the country will unanimously adopt them.

　　1. Set July 1st to July 7th as the Peace Declaration Signature Campaign Week. All agencies, troops, people's representative conferences at all levels, mass organizations, democratic parties, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese can choose any day during this week to conduct a widespread signature campaign. Individuals who have already signed do not need to sign again, but agencies that have already held a signature campaign may hold it again.

　　2. Before the signature day, various tools, methods, and venues (such as schools, factories, cinemas, theaters, etc.) and opportunities (such as temple fairs in rural areas) should be used to conduct extensive publicity and carry out patriotic and internationalist education.

　　3. The propaganda policy should be based on the "Common Program" and special attention should be paid to the provisions of Articles 11 and 54 of the "Common Program":

　　"The People's Republic of China unites with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples in the world, first of all, unites with the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and all oppressed nations, and stands on the side of the international peace and democracy camp to jointly oppose imperialist aggression and safeguard lasting world peace." (Article 11)

　　"The People's Republic of China...supports lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries, and opposes the imperialist policy of aggression and war." (Article 54)

　　4. Organized units should play a leading role. In addition to conducting signatures within their own units, they must also unite with brother units or independently launch the signature campaign to the masses who have not yet been organized.

　　5. By the end of August, each unit should send the statistics of the signature results to the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace. The original signatures can be handed over to the local Peace Defense Sub-Committee, and those without a sub-committee established should be handed over to the New Democratic Youth League or other mass organizations for safekeeping.

### 中国人民政协全国委员会  号召全国人民参加保卫和平签名  定七月一日至七日为和平宣言签名运动周

　　中国人民政协全国委员会
    号召全国人民参加保卫和平签名
    定七月一日至七日为和平宣言签名运动周
    【新华社二十三日讯】人民政协全国委员会第二次会议今日全体一致通过“中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会号召全国人民展开保卫世界和平签名运动的办法”该办法内容全文如下：
    和平建设是人类幸福的主要因素。全世界进步人类莫不重视和平，希望建设工作能够得到保障，以增进共同的幸福。
    以我国而言，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，经过了长期的坚苦斗争，已经打破了半封建半殖民地性的枷锁，争取到了基本上的和平。我们正在用大力来恢复并发展各项建设，对于和平尤其感觉着珍贵。
    但在今天，帝国主义的侵略集团为了满足极少数人的贪婪欲望，更为了挽救帝国主义的没落危机，在第二次世界大战结束后，即重新组织争战，疯狂地扩充军事基地，从事武备竞赛，扶植反动势力，企图奴役全世界进步人类。世界和平显著地受着了威胁。
    特别是原子能的利用是一个不容忽视的问题。原子能的发现和利用本来是人类文化所获得的最高成果，但在能被利用于生产建设之前，却不幸被利用为大量杀人的武器，而落在侵略者的手里。侵略者更夸大着这项武器的威力，经常地威胁着全人类的安全。
    为此世界保卫和平大会在三月中旬斯德哥尔摩会议上曾经发出宣言：
    “要求无条件禁止大量毁灭人类的原子武器，并要求建立严格的国际管制来保证这个决议的执行。”
    “凡首先使用原子武器去反对任何国家的政府便犯了违反人类的罪恶，应该当作战争罪犯看待。”
    斯德哥尔摩会议更“号召全世界一切善良的人们在这个宣言上签名”。这是极合时宜的有效的一项运动，本会表示完全接受，并已一致执行了签名的任务。
    签名运动业已在全世界范围内展开，获得了极其热烈的拥护。例如东欧新民主主义国家签名成绩都占全人口百分之八十左右。这正证明人类爱好和平的迫切，和平阵营的力量不可轻侮。和平阵营的力量增加一分，战争贩子的顾忌便增加一分。和平阵营的力量如能不断地增加，战争的危机便可能制止，原子能的利用也可能逐步地像苏联一样导引上为和平建设服务的阶段。
    我国在争取和平、保卫和平上，是应该积极地显示我们的力量的。中国保卫世界和平大会委员会为了响应斯德哥尔摩会议的号召，曾于四月二十八日对该会各地分支会发出指示：在全国各地发动签名运动。但以中国幅员广大，人口众多，一时尚未能广泛地展开。该会顷向本会建议，请求本会向全国人民号召，更进一步地展开保卫世界和平签名运动。本会接受了这项建议，特制订各项办法如下，希望全国人民一致采纳。
    一、以七月一日至七月七日为和平宣言签名运动周，全国各机关，各部队，各级人民代表会议，各民众团体，各民主党派，各少数民族以及海外侨胞，在这一周中可任选一日进行广泛的签名运动。业已签名的个人可不必重签，但业已举行签名运动的机构则不妨再次举行。
    二、举行签名日之前应利用各种工具、各种方式、各种场所（如学校、工场、电影院、戏院等）各种机会（如在乡村中可利用庙会）作广泛的宣传，进行爱国主义与国际主义的教育。
    三、宣传方针应依据“共同纲领”，并应特别注意“共同纲领”的第十一条与第五十四条的规定：
    “中华人民共和国联合世界上一切爱好和平、自由的国家和人民，首先是联合苏联、各人民民主国家和各被压迫民族，站在国际和平民主阵营方面，共同反对帝国主义侵略，以保障世界的持久和平。”（第十一条）
    “中华人民共和国……拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。”（第五十四条）
    四、有组织的单位应起领导作用，除在本单位内进行签名之外，还须联合兄弟单位或单独地将签名运动向尚未有组织的群众展开。
    五、签名结果，期于八月底以前，由各单位将统计数字寄交中国保卫世界和平委员会，其签名原件可交由各地保卫和平分会，其无分会成立处则交由新民主主义青年团，或其它民众团体，负责保管。
