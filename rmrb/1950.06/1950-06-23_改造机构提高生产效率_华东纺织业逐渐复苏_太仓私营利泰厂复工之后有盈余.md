　　Reforming Institutions to Improve Production Efficiency
    East China's Textile Industry Gradually Recovers
    Taicang Private Lintai Factory Achieves Surplus After Resuming Production
    [This newspaper reports] Private cotton textile industries in various parts of East China, after sincere consultations between labor and management in April and May, focusing on production and streamlining institutions, have, with government support, gradually reached a point of breaking even or even achieving a surplus.

    This improvement became most evident after the Third Shanghai People's Representative Conference in April and the First East China Textile Conference in May. Especially at the East China Textile Conference, after exchanging experiences in overcoming difficulties, the confidence of factory owners in striving for improvement was further strengthened. Among these experiences, the private Lintai Textile Factory in Taicang County, Southern Jiangsu, is one of the best examples.

  Poor Management Caused Difficulties
    Before liberation, the factory had spent as much as US$130,000 on extensively repairing machinery, which affected its capital and strength. After liberation, unreasonable management and operating methods were not improved, resulting in many losses, heavy debts, and staggering interest expenses. According to statistics, the percentage of interest expenses in the factory's total expenses gradually increased from 12.65% in July of last year to 62.14% in December of the same year. Furthermore, the factory had a huge and redundant structure. In addition to the head office, it had branches in Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Changshu, Jiading, and other places. The number of section chiefs in the business office, general affairs office, and other departments reached 18. With 18,800 spindles, the factory employed 1,559 workers, which was more than most yarn factories. Coupled with backward technology, unclear rewards and punishments, and abnormal labor-management relations, the factory had so many shortcomings that, as the business section chief Yu Yanshang said, it was a collection of all the shortcomings of other yarn factories, and finally announced its closure on January 9 of this year.

  Determined to Improve Production
  Streamlining Personnel and Reforming Institutions
    After the shutdown, the owners once wanted to leave, but finally decided to stay. After exchanging opinions with the government, they realized that there was hope of breaking even as long as they streamlined. So they were determined to improve production. After returning to the factory and consulting with the workers, they received enthusiastic support from the workers. The trade union continuously consulted with the owners and jointly proposed a streamlining plan. After three months and fifty or sixty meetings of various sizes, it was decided to streamline personnel according to actual needs. The retention or dismissal of personnel was proposed by the streamlining committee, which was composed of representatives from the factory's labor and management, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, and the General Trade Union, according to the principles of dismissal and retention, and submitted to the trade union for democratic evaluation and decision by sub-sections and groups. In order to take care of the livelihood of those who were dismissed during the transition period for changing careers or returning to their hometowns for production, it was agreed to issue severance pay according to the number of years of service. In addition, all unpaid subsidies and year-end bonuses for February and March were paid retroactively. A total of 56 staff members and 568 workers were laid off. The severance pay and year-end bonus subsidies to be paid totaled 224,753.15 Shanghai equivalent units. In order to take care of the factory's difficulty in raising funds temporarily, with the consent of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, 97,000 units were allocated from the processing fees received for contracted spinning as part of the severance pay. If the payment was delayed, the labor side would be subsidized 0.682 units per person per day. Therefore, all severance pay was paid before May 10, and the streamlining work was initially completed.

  Reduced Costs and Gained Profits
    Since the factory streamlined its institutions, it resumed work on April 5, improved production efficiency, and greatly reduced costs. In April, it spun 1,000 bales of cotton yarn on a contract basis, with a processing fee of 200 units per bale, and an additional 10 units per bale for bagging fees for 800 bales, for a total processing fee income of 208,000 units. The cost of processing each bale of yarn was only 195.8 units according to the budget, and the cost of processing 1,000 bales of yarn was 195,800 units. The actual expenditure in April was in line with the budget, and the processing of 1,000 bales of yarn resulted in a profit of 12,200 Shanghai equivalent units. The reason for the profit was primarily because the workers took care of the factory's difficulties, and wages were paid according to the actual output ratio, which kept the proportion of wages and salaries in the processing cost fixed, regardless of the decrease in output. At the same time, the owners also took care of the minimum living standards of the employees, and subsidized each person 0.68 units per day during the non-processing period, and no less than 30 units per month during the processing period. Secondly, efficiency increased and costs decreased after streamlining. For example, before streamlining, the amount of yarn produced per spindle in 22 hours was 0.79 pounds, and the standard was 0.85 pounds. In April, the average was 0.924 pounds, and the highest reached 1.04 pounds.

    According to the budget for the cost of processing 700 bales of yarn in May, the cost of processing each bale of yarn was 162.1 units, which was 33.7 units less than the processing cost in the previous period. Therefore, profits will gradually increase.

  Rectifying Finances and Raising Additional Funds
    After overcoming the difficulties in production, the difficulties in financial revenue and expenditure were then overcome. On the other hand, in addition to trying to improve the shortcomings of poor quality, the manager Chen Lupi has gone to Hong Kong to plan to raise funds to return to the country, in order to expand operations and develop production on the basis of recovery. The factory's production has thus gone from serious losses and shutdowns to breaking even and having a surplus.

    There are many other examples, and many have appeared in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places. For example, the private Huafeng, Xinyi, Daxin, Wanfeng, Dawei, Jianlun, Guangxin, Zhenfeng, and other factories in Shanghai have all overcome difficulties and achieved self-sufficiency due to the trade union focusing on production, the owners actively managing, and government support.

    In the struggle against difficulties, both labor and management have fully demonstrated the spirit of "suffering first, enjoying later," improving production efficiency while reducing treatment. Especially after the National Textile Trade Union called on workers to focus on production in February and March of this year, it has become a common practice for workers in Shanghai and Wuxi and other regions to voluntarily reduce working hours, wages, and meals. The production efficiency of private yarn factories in Shanghai has also generally increased. By the end of April, the average spindle draft had reached 0.794 pounds, which not only set a new high after liberation, but also exceeded the 0.779 pounds before liberation. Private yarn factories in Wuxi have also generally increased by 0.1 pounds compared to the original.

    Most manufacturers have recognized the nature of the difficulties and the bright future, and some have continued to transfer funds and raw materials back from abroad. According to statistics, the private yarn factories in East China have imported a total of 40,758 bales of cotton with their own foreign exchange and yarn-cloth exchange after liberation, as of May 20 (of which 19,487 bales were for contracts signed before liberation).

  Improving Situation and Broad Prospects
    As for the raw cotton problem, the raw cotton supply required by private yarn factories in the entire East China region from June to October (before the new cotton is on the market) has basically been guaranteed. The small portion that is lacking should be made up by the factories themselves. Because in order to supply raw cotton to maintain the production of private factories, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company once strived to import foreign cotton regardless of losses. For example, on March 15, the import of each picul of foreign cotton to Shanghai cost 1,666,300 yuan, but according to the cotton price on May 17, it was only worth 970,000 yuan. Under such circumstances, some private factories still sold the foreign cotton stored in Hong Kong on the spot for profit, without trying to import it. This is indeed a very regrettable thing, and it violates the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests. Therefore, when calculating the amount of raw cotton that private yarn factories in the entire East China region may have under their control before the new cotton is on the market this year at the East China Textile Conference, the foreign cotton that each factory has obtained with its own foreign exchange and exported yarn and cloth but has not yet imported was included, which showed that private factories further recognized the significance of giving consideration to both public and private interests. The wool textile industry and the silk weaving industry have also formulated production plans and are willing to work hard to improve management and overcome difficulties.

    As for the processing fee problem, most of them expressed satisfaction at the textile conference, except for a few areas that requested special consideration. Although some factories are currently not breaking even, they all expressed their willingness to work hard according to this processing standard. Because in fact, this is completely achievable, and there are already many examples.

    Therefore, judging from the overall situation of the cotton textile industry, the situation will get better day by day in the future, and the prospects are infinitely broad and bright.

　　改造机构提高生产效率
    华东纺织业逐渐复苏
    太仓私营利泰厂复工之后有盈余
    【本报讯】华东区各地的私营棉纺织业，经四、五两月劳资双方开诚协商，面向生产，精简机构，在政府扶植下，不少工厂已先后达到保本自给甚至有了盈余。
    这种好转的情况，在经过四月份上海三届人民代表会议与五月份华东首届纺织会议后，表现得最为明显。特别在华东纺织会议上，各地交流了克服困难的经验以后，各厂资方对于争取好转的信心更进一步地加强了。这些经验当中，苏南太仓县私营利泰纺织厂是最好的范例之一。
  经营不善造成困难
    该厂在解放前，由于大肆修理机器，曾耗资达美金十三万元，影响了资金与实力。解放后不合理的管理和经营方式仍未加改进，致亏累甚多，负债累累，利息费用负担惊人。据统计，该厂利息支出占全部费用的百分率，由去年七月份的百分之一二·六五，逐渐增加到同年十二月份的百分之六二·一四。又该厂机构庞大，人浮于事。如该厂除总公司外，尚有上海、苏州、无锡、常州、常熟、嘉定等分支机构。单营业处、总务处等处长即达十八人之多。有纱锭一八、八○○枚，职工人数即达一千五百五十九人，比一般纱厂所用人员都多。再加技术落后，赏罚不明，劳资关系不正常，其缺点之多，正如该厂业务股长于延商所说：是集其他纱厂缺点之大成，终于在今年一月九日宣告停工。
  下定决心搞好生产
  精简人员改造机构
    停工后，资方曾一度想走掉，最后还是决定留下来。经与政府交换意见，认识到只要精简，保本是有希望的，于是下定决心搞好生产。回厂与工人协商，得到工人热烈支持。工会不断与资方协商，共同提出精简方案，经过三个月的时间及五、六十次大小会议，决定按实际需要精简人员。留用或解雇均由该厂劳资双方及工商局、总工会各方代表所组成之精简委员会提出解雇和留用原则，交与工会，举行分部分组民主评议决定。且为照顾被解雇者转业或回乡生产过渡期间生活起见，议定依照工龄年数分等发给解雇金。此外对未发的二、三月份补贴及年奖一概补发。计共解雇职员五十六人，工人五百六十八人。应发解雇金及年奖补贴等共须二二四、七五三·一五上海折实单位。劳方为照顾厂方款项一时不易筹出的困难，得到花纱布公司同意后，在承接代纺工缴中拨借九万七千单位移作发给解雇金的一部分。如因延迟发给再贴补劳方每日每人○·六八二单位。因之全部解雇金均于五月十日前发清，精简工作得以初步完成。
  成本减低获得利润
    该厂自精简机构后，于四月五日起复工，生产效率提高，成本大大减低。四月份代纺棉纱一千件，每件工缴二百单位，又八百件中另加大包费每件十个单位，共计工缴收入二○八、○○○单位，而每件代纺成本按照预算仅一九五·八单位，一千件纱代纺成本共计一九五、八○○单位。四月份实际支出和预算相符，一千件代纺纱可有利润一万二千二百个上海折实单位。所以获得利润的原因，首先是由于工人照顾厂方困难，薪资均按照实际产量比例折扣发给，这使工资与薪金两项支出，不受产量减少而相对提高，而在代纺成本内所占的比率固定起来。同时资方亦为照顾职工最低生活，若在无代纺期间，每人每天津贴○·六八单位，在代纺期间，至少每月不得低于三十个单位。其次是由于精简后，效率提高，成本减低。如该厂在精简前每枚纱锭二十二小时产纱量为○·七九磅，规定标准○·八五磅，四月份平均○·九二四磅，最高达一·○四磅。
    按照五月份代纺七百件纱成本的预算，每件纱代纺成本为一六二·一单位，比上期代纺成本又减少三三·七单位。故利润将逐渐增多。
  整顿财务筹增资金
    生产上的困难克服后，继而克服了财务收支上的困难。另一方面，该厂除设法改进品质不好的缺点外，经理陈鹿苹已赴港筹划资金回国，俾在恢复的基础上扩大经营，发展生产。该厂生产就是这样地从严重赔累、停工，而走向保本并有盈余。
    其他的例子还很多，在上海无锡等地均出现不少。如上海私营华丰、新一、大新、万丰、大纬、健轮、光新、震丰等厂，都是由于工会面向生产，资方经营积极和政府的扶植下而终于战胜困难，达到了保本自给。
    各厂劳资双方在与困难作斗争的当中，工人阶级充分表现了“吃苦在先，享乐在后”的精神，在减低待遇中，提高生产效率。尤其在今年二、三月，全国纺织工会号召工人们面向生产后，上海和无锡等地区工人自动减工、减薪、减膳已成为普遍的事实。上海私营纱厂的生产效率亦普遍提高，到四月底锭扯平均已达○·七九四磅，不但创解放后的最高纪录，且超过解放前夕○·七七九磅的出数。无锡私营纱厂也普遍地较原来提高了○·一磅。
    大部分厂家认识了困难的性质和光明的前途，也有络续从国外调回资金和原料的，据统计：华东区私营纱厂在解放后以自备外汇和纱布交换的进口棉花，截至五月二十日止，共计四万零七百五十八包（其中一万九千四百八十七包系完成解放前所订之合约）。
  情况好转前途广阔
    至于原棉问题，全华东区的私营纱厂，从六月起到十月止（新花上市前），所需的原棉供应，基本上已经有了保障。所缺的少部分自应由各厂努力争取弥补。因为花纱布公司为了供应原棉维持私营厂的生产，曾经不顾亏累争取外棉进口，如三月十五日每担外棉进口到上海需值一百六十六万六千三百元，但照五月十七日的花价，仅值九十七万元。在这样的情况下，某些私营厂还将原存香港的外棉，贪图利益而就地卖出，不设法进口。这实在是一件很遗憾的事情，这是有违公私兼顾原则的。所以在这次华东纺织会议上计算今年新花上市前，华东全区私营纱厂可能掌握的原棉数额时，是把各厂以自备外汇和出口纱布所换得而尚未进口的外棉都包括在内，这表现了私营厂进一步认识了公私兼顾的意义。毛纺业和丝织业也订定了生产计划，愿意为改良经营，克服困难而努力。
    对于代纺工缴问题，在纺织会议上，除若干地区要求特殊照顾外，大部分都表示满意，虽然若干厂目前还不够本，但都表示愿意根据这个代纺标准去努力。因为事实上，这是完全可以办到的，而且已经有了不少例子。
    所以，从整个棉纺业的情况看来，今后的情况会一天比一天好，前途是无限广阔而光明的。
