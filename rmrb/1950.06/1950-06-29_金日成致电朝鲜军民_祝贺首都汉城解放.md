　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 28th. General Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a cable to the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, the people of the whole country, and the citizens of Seoul on the 28th, congratulating the liberation of Seoul. The text of the telegram is as follows:
    The heroic People's Army completely liberated our motherland's capital, Seoul, from the rule of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime at 11:30 on the 28th. On this occasion, on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I extend my congratulations to all the Korean people and express my gratitude to the heroic officers and soldiers of the People's Army who liberated our capital. At the same time, I extend my congratulations to the citizens of Seoul who have been liberated from the fascist oppression of the Syngman Rhee gang.
    In order to end the civil war launched by the traitorous Syngman Rhee gang as soon as possible, so that the motherland and the people can embark on the road of happiness and peaceful construction, the entire Korean people should devote all their efforts to support the heroic advancing People's Army. The people and guerrillas in the southern half of Korea, who are operating behind enemy lines, must harass the enemy's rear, actively launch guerrilla warfare, initiate popular uprising movements everywhere, and do their utmost to assist the People's Army, striving to prevent the weapons and military supplies supplied by the American imperialists to the traitorous Syngman Rhee gang from reaching our territory.
    The liberated citizens of Seoul must quickly establish a democratic order and begin the work of restoring and reconstructing the capital. They must quickly restore their own political organs - the People's Committees - that were dissolved by the reactionaries and actively assist the People's Army.
    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has appointed Comrade Li Chengye, Minister of the Ministry of Justice of the Cabinet of the Republic, as Chairman of the Provisional People's Committee of the capital city of Seoul.
    Long live the unified Korean people!
    Glory to the heroic People's Army!
    (Note: Article 103 of the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stipulates: "The capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is Seoul." Pyongyang is the temporary capital before the reunification of the North and South.)

　　金日成致电朝鲜军民
    祝贺首都汉城解放
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国部长会议主席金日成将军于二十八日致电朝鲜人民军官兵、全国人民及汉城市民，祝贺汉城的解放。电文如下：
    英勇的人民军已于二十八日十一时三十分，从李承晚傀儡政权的统治中，完全解放了我祖国的首都汉城市。当此之际，我代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，向全朝鲜人民致贺，向解放我首都的英勇的人民军官兵致谢。同时我向从李承晚匪帮的法西斯压迫下获得解放的汉城市民致贺。
    全朝鲜人民为早日结束李承晚卖国匪帮所发动的内战，以便使祖国与人民步入幸福和平的建设大道．应倾注一切力量，来支援英勇前进中的人民军。在敌后活动的朝鲜南半部的人民与游击队，要扰乱敌人后方，积极展开游击战，到处发起人民起义运动，竭力协助人民军，为使美帝国主义者供给李承晚卖国匪帮的武器和军需品无法运抵我们的国土而积极斗争。
    解放了的汉城市民要迅速建立民主秩序，并着手进行首都的恢复建设工作，要迅速恢复曾被反动派解散的人民自己的政权机关——人民委员会，要积极援助人民军。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府业已任命共和国部长会议所属司法部部长李承烨同志为共和国首都汉城市临时人民委员会委员长。
    统一的朝鲜人民万岁！
    光荣归于英勇的人民军！
    （按：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法第一百零三条规定：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的首都为汉城。”平壤系南北未统一前的临时首都。）
