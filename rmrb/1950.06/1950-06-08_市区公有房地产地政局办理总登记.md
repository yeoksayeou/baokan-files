Other public properties shall be directly applied for by the current using government organs and enterprises. For example, enterprise and agency housing that has been appraised and used as national investment should be registered by the enterprise or agency itself.

　　市区公有房地产地政局办理总登记
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府地政局为从速完成地籍整理，厘定公有房地产权，决定从六月一日起办理京市城区公有房地产总登记。声请登记时须注意：凡经京市公逆产清管局管理的房地产，应由该局统一声请登记。其他公产，由现使用机关企业径行声请，例如企业机关用房已估价作为国家投资者，应由该企业机关自行登记。声请登记公有房地产的机关应指定代理人携带有关契证、机关戳记及代理人名章，向京市人民政府地政局办理声请登记手续。凡在国民党反动政权统治时期及解放后已办完登记手续之公有房地产，亦须一律另行声请登记，以期一致。但在解放后已办理登记者，可以免费换发新登记证。
