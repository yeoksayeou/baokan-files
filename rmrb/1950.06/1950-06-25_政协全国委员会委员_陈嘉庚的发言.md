Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: The full text of the speech given by Chen Jiageng, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC on June 22nd is as follows:

	Chairman, fellow committee members, ladies and gentlemen:

	After listening to the reports on land reform, finance and taxation, military and political diplomacy, and cultural education made by the central leaders this time, I am very excited and very satisfied.

	It has only been eight months since the establishment of our Central People's Government. Militarily, the Liberation War has progressed rapidly. Not only is the mainland advance invincible, but also the capture of Hainan across the sea is as easy as turning one's hand, making the remnant bandits in Taiwan frightened and restless. I believe that the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet is not far off. In terms of financial and economic construction, we have vigorously promoted financial unification, which has led to currency recovery and price stability, creating an unprecedented unified situation in Chinese financial history. In diplomacy, we have concluded a treaty of alliance and friendship with our ally, the Soviet Union, writing the first page of truly equal and mutually beneficial diplomatic history for China in the past hundred years. It can be said to be brilliant and unprecedented! Other aspects, such as cultural education and production construction, have been progressing steadily and carried out according to our capabilities. Chairman Mao said: "This year will be better than last year, and next year will be better than this year." Looking at the current situation and speculating on the future situation, I believe this statement is definitely correct.

	The performance of land reform was already very satisfactory when I inspected the Northeast last autumn. Because farmers work more conscientiously on their own land than before, weeds are cleared from the fields, and they are cultivated again to make future harvests more abundant. This is a rare phenomenon in agriculture in the provinces within the customs and the various countries in Southeast Asia. Of course, this was not the case before the land reform. It can be seen that land reform can promote production. I have already mentioned this in my collection of impressions from the Northeast.

	To build a new China, we must first develop new industries. The primary industry is steel production. Regardless of light or heavy industry, it is closely related to steel. Even something as small as a needle cannot be made without steel. If a country cannot produce steel, it cannot become an industrialized country, let alone become rich and strong. Anshan and Benxi in the Northeast produce a lot of steel, with a daily output of more than 7,000 tons, and it can be expanded in the future. The production of steel in the Northeast and the achievements of various constructions in the Northeast can gradually assist the construction of the provinces within the customs. There is definitely hope for the transformation of an agricultural country into an industrial country.

	I left Beijing at the end of last autumn and went south, passing through North China, East China, Central China, and South China. In February of this year, I went to Singapore again. I paid close attention to investigating the most important issues of grain and production for the people in the country along the way. I learned that several provinces and regions suffered from floods last autumn, and the government had actively taken measures to provide relief, so there were no serious difficulties. Before I had been in Southeast Asia for two months, the imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary newspapers had extensively publicized that our country was suffering from a great famine and great disasters, and the government could not provide relief. Half of the Chinese people were afraid of starving to death. Especially the hypocritical American imperialism was boasting about how it was preparing to transport a large amount of food to China for disaster relief, nagging endlessly every day. Based on the facts I had seen in my motherland, I published a conversation in the Singapore Nanyang Siang Pau, vehemently refuting them. In April and May, the domestic newspapers carried reports that the major cities had sufficient grain and goods prepared, and prices had generally fallen. The Central People's Government implemented unified finances, most of the old currency was withdrawn, the issuance of new currency was stopped, and revenue and expenditure were close to balance. The people became more stable. The imperialist rumors collapsed without being attacked. This time I came to China again, and all the things I have seen and heard have filled me with great confidence in the development of the new China.

	Let me report on the situation in Southeast Asia in passing. Since Japan's defeat and surrender, the nationalities in various places have been seeking independence and liberation, and the situation of war against their colonial governments has become increasingly fierce! Even those that have nominally gained independence are still being controlled by imperialism behind the scenes. There are more than 10 million overseas Chinese in various places, who are either treated harshly by the colonial governments or excluded by the local nationalities. The situation of losses is too numerous to recount. Overseas orphans have no way to complain. Since the establishment of our Central People's Government, we only hope that diplomatic relations will be established as soon as possible, and that envoys will be sent to provide effective protection through normal diplomatic procedures. They are eagerly looking forward to it every day, like a great drought hoping for clouds!

	Regarding remittances from overseas Chinese, in the early days of liberation, local authorities did not implement the policy on remittances from overseas Chinese very proficiently, and some overseas Chinese suffered some losses. However, after the government's continuous research and improvement, it got on the right track in a very short period of time. In particular, the issuance of "Overseas Remittance Original Currency Deposit Certificates" guarantees the value of overseas remittances and facilitates the use of family members of overseas Chinese. In the past two months, domestic prices have fallen and the value of the RMB has stabilized, which has further strengthened the confidence of overseas Chinese. In Xiamen alone, remittances from overseas Chinese increased from 6 million Hong Kong dollars in April to more than 11 million Hong Kong dollars in May. It can be seen that remittances from overseas Chinese have gradually increased and are gradually entering a normal state, which is worth celebrating. I believe that the more than 10 million overseas Chinese, after hearing the news of the various reports at this meeting, are even more excited and delighted than their compatriots in the country. Their support for the People's Government of the motherland will naturally be expressed more and more enthusiastically day by day. There is no doubt about this.

	Long live the Communist Party of China!

	Long live Chairman Mao!

	Long live the People's Republic of China!

### 政协全国委员会委员  陈嘉庚的发言

    政协全国委员会委员
    陈嘉庚的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】全国委员会委员陈嘉庚二十二日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    这回听了中央各首长所作土地改革、财经税收、军政外交、文化教育各项报告，我是非常兴奋，而且是非常满意的。
    我们中央人民政府成立至今，不过八个月的时间，在军事上解放战争迅速进展，非但大陆进军所向无敌，即渡海攻取海南，也易如反掌，使台湾残匪惊心动魄，寝食不安。相信台湾和西藏的解放，也已为期不远。在财经建设上，大力推行财政统一，而使通货回笼，物价稳定，造成中国财政史上所未有过的大统一的局面。在外交方面，与我们盟邦苏联缔结同盟友好协定，写下了中国百数十年来真正平等互惠的第一页外交史。真可说辉煌炳耀，旷古所无！他如文化教育，生产建设，都已步步平稳，量力进行。毛主席说：“今年会比去年好，明年会比今年好。”我们看看现在的情形，再揣测未来的局面，相信这话一定不错。
    土地改革的成绩表现，我在去年秋往东北视察时，已认为十分美满，因农民在自己的土地工作，比前认真，田园杂草除净，还再加工耕耘，使将来收获更加丰足。这是关内各省及南洋各邦农业上所罕见的现象。在未土改以前，当然无此情形。可见土改能促进生产。我写那本东北观感集，已把这事提述过。
    建设新的中国，首先要发展新的工业，工业首要为钢铁生产，不论轻重工业，皆与钢铁有密切关系。微细如一枝针，非靠钢铁不成，一个国家如不能生产钢铁，便无法成为工业国，更无富强可言。东北鞍山及本溪等处，所产钢铁甚丰，每日产量可达七千余吨，今后尚可扩展，东北钢铁的生产，及东北各项建设的成绩，可逐渐协助关内各省的建设，农业国转变为工业国一定是有希望的。
    我在去年秋末离京南下，经过华北、华东、华中、华南，至本年二月再往新加坡，对国内人民最重要的粮食及生产等事，沿途注意调查，知道去年秋间有几个省区遭受水灾，政府已积极设法救济。不致有何严重困难，乃抵南洋未及两月，帝国主义及国民党反动派的报纸，竟大事宣传，说我国怎样遭受大饥荒，大灾难，政府无法救济，半个中国人民恐怕要被饿死了，尤其假仁假义的美帝国主义，还大吹要如何准备大量粮食运入中国赈济，日日絮聒不休，我乃根据祖国所见事实，在新加坡南侨日报发表谈话，痛予驳斥。至四、五月间，国内各地报纸所载，各大城市粮食物品准备充足物价普遍降落，中央人民政府对财政实行统一，旧币多数回笼，新币停止发出，收支接近平衡，人民更为安定，帝国主义的谣言，到此更不攻自破了，这回再到国内，所得一切见闻，对新中国前途的发展，更充满了万分的信心。
    南洋情况，顺便报告一二，自日本败降以后，各地民族为求独立解放，对其殖民地各帝国政府，势成水火，战争局面，愈来愈烈！其在表面上已得独立的，而帝国主义仍在背后把持。华侨在各地有一千万人以上，或受殖民地的政府苛待，或被当地民族排斥，损失惨况，不可胜计，海外孤儿告诉无门。自我中央人民政府成立，惟望早日建立外交关系，派出使领以正常外交手续，予以切实保护，他们日日引领期待，有如大旱之望云霓！
    侨汇方面，在解放初期，各地方当局对侨汇政策，还执行得不很纯熟，有些侨胞是受了多少损失的。然经政府不断的研究和改善，在很短时间，就走上正轨了，特别是印发“侨汇原币存单”保证侨汇的价值，方便侨眷的使用，最近两月，国内物价下降，人民币币值稳定，更加强了侨胞的信心。厦门一地，侨汇由四月份六百万元港币增加到五月份一千一百余万元港币，可见侨汇已渐渐增加，渐渐走入正常的状态了，这是值得我们欢幸的。我相信在海外一千多万的华侨听到了这次会议的各种报告的消息，其欢跃愉快的心情，比在国内的同胞是更加兴奋的，其拥护祖国人民政府，自然会一天一天地热烈表露出来，这是毫无疑义的。
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
