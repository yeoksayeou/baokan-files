　　Shuyang County Government Loans Grain
    Solving Difficulties in Summer Hoeing for Disaster Victims
    Strives to Hoe Once or Twice Before Wheat Harvest
    [Our Newspaper Shuyang News] In Shuyang County, a severely affected disaster area in northern Jiangsu, there are currently 1,011,000 mu of spring fields that have not been cultivated or have only been cultivated once before sowing, accounting for 72% of the county's spring fields. The county's leading organs have instructed all levels to strengthen leadership, help the masses solve difficulties, and carry out summer hoeing, aiming to hoe once or twice before the wheat harvest. This spring, due to excessive rainfall, most of the wheat and spring fields in low-lying areas were flooded. For example, in the Hudong severely affected disaster area, more than 94,000 mu out of 120,000 mu of wheat were flooded, delaying the sowing time. The difficulties existing in summer hoeing are: ① Severe shortage of agricultural implements, with the county lacking at least 30,000 hoes; ② Disaster victims have been eating wild vegetables and grass roots for a long time, resulting in physical exhaustion and low summer hoeing efficiency; ③ Lack of labor. The Yi River project has just ended, and another 12,000 people participated in the Zao River Dam project on the 19th of last month. After understanding these situations, the county government and the CCP County Committee issued instructions on the 15th of last month, requiring districts and townships in highland areas where spring plowing has ended to immediately switch to summer hoeing and to help disaster victims solve difficulties: ① In addition to mobilizing the masses to repair and borrow agricultural implements, the government will lend 200,000 jin of grain to help replenish them. ② 500,000 jin of grain will be distributed to help disaster victims recover their physical strength. ③ Detailed efforts should be made to organize all and semi-able-bodied laborers and implement mutual assistance. Summer hoeing has now been widely launched. For example, the masses in Anfeng, Liuji and other districts in the highlands have fully invested in summer hoeing. Most of Liuji District has cleared the first hoeing, and some have hoed twice. (Shen Chenglu, Shao Jianya)

　　沭阳县府贷发粮食
    解决灾民夏锄中的困难         
    争取麦收前锄一遍到二遍
    【本报沭阳讯】苏北重灾区沭阳县，目前尚有未耕或仅耕一遍即下种的春田一百零一万一千多亩，占全县春田百分之七十二。县领导机关指示各级加强领导，帮助群众解决困难，进行夏锄，要在麦收前锄一遍至两遍。该县今春因雨水较多，洼地麦子及春田大部被淹，如湖东重灾区十二万多亩麦即淹去九万四千多亩，延迟了下种时间。夏锄中存在着的困难是：①农具奇缺，全县至少缺三万把锄头；②灾民长期吃野菜草根，体力枯竭，夏锄效力很低；③缺乏劳动力。沂河工程刚结束，上月十九号又有一万二千人参加打皂河坝工程。县府和中共县委了解了这些情况，特于上月十五日发出指示，要高岗地春耕已结束的区、乡立即转入夏锄，并要帮助灾民解决困难：①农具除发动群众修理、借用外，政府借粮二十万斤帮助添置。②发放五十万斤粮食，使灾民恢复体力。③要深入细致地将全劳力半劳力组织起来，实行互助。现夏锄已普遍展开、如高坡地的安峰、刘集等区群众，都全力投入夏锄。刘集区大部锄清头遍，一部分锄过两遍。（沈成露、邵建亚）
