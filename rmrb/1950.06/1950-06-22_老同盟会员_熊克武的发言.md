　　Speech by Xiong Kewu, Veteran Member of the Tongmenghui

　　【Xinhua News Agency, June 21st】The following is the full text of the speech delivered by Xiong Kewu, a veteran member of the Tongmenghui, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 21st: Chairman, fellow members, ladies and gentlemen:

　　I am honored to attend this meeting and listen to the important reports, especially the policies on land reform and adjustment of industry and commerce, which fill me with immense joy! These policies are what I have hoped for and strived for over the years, but could not realize. Now they are becoming reality. This is due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its long-term, arduous struggle, which has achieved a revolutionary victory of epoch-making significance, opening up the path of reform and construction. Only by universally implementing these policies can we build a new China that is independent, free, prosperous, and unified. This is a very correct path and very appropriate policies.

　　For nearly a century, China has been reduced to a semi-colonial state, with domestic feudal forces colluding with international imperialism to form a semi-colonial and semi-feudal rule, oppressing the vast majority of the people. This oppressed vast majority, of course, are the peasants who account for more than 80 percent of the population. After the May Fourth Movement, the oppression suffered by the proletariat workers became even more severe. In a country with such a situation, if we want to overthrow the rule of the combination of feudal forces and imperialism, there is no other way than the strength of the workers, peasants, and the broad masses. I have personally experienced painful experiences and lessons in this regard. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, in order to oppose this semi-colonial and semi-feudal rule, I joined the Tongmenghui, followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen in engaging in revolution, and participated in uprisings in various places, such as Chengdu, Guang'an, Xufu, and Jiang'an in Sichuan, and the Guangzhou Uprising of 1911. We braved the dangers and risked our lives, and we were indeed brave, but the achievements were very limited. Although the Revolution of 1911 was successful, the result was a failure. At the time of the Revolution of 1911, we were one with the masses, but as the struggle continued, the masses gradually decreased, and the achievements of the revolution became even more elusive. What is the reason for this? Looking at it today, if we want to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and the later-emerging bureaucratic capitalism, without the working class and peasants as the basic driving force, without the united front formed by the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, and especially without the strong leadership of the Communist Party, it is impossible to succeed. From this, we can further understand that although there were heroic revolutionary actions at that time, they were only equivalent to individual behaviors, and what benefit did they have for social reform. The Communist Party opened up a new situation in the revolution, knowing that without organizing these workers and peasants, who were the most severely oppressed by the enemy and the largest in number, under the leadership of the Party as the basic force, and adding the united front it led, it would be unimaginable to eliminate the powerful and cunning three enemies. Although I have engaged in revolution personally, I have not achieved much, and I do not know such methods and strategies, and I feel deeply ashamed. However, seeing the success of the revolution and the growth of the People's Republic of China; seeing the realization of revolutionary ideals one by one, I am very excited. Taking land reform as an example, Mr. Sun Yat-sen first advocated "equal land rights" and later proposed the slogan "land to the tillers," but how to implement it? He did not put forward concrete measures; which political party? Which government? It was very vague in my personal consciousness who would lead the implementation. Now, listening to Vice Chairman Liu's report, explaining the future of land reform, pointing out the path of developing production and building agriculture, and especially putting forward specific methods, which are very thorough and appropriate. Chairman Mao once said: "The national economy has fundamentally improved." Such reform measures are the characteristics of improvement. I think land reform was just a slogan at that time, but now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, it has been concretely implemented, which I personally very much support. Recalling that the victory of the Liberation War was largely due to land reform, it can further prove that the current land reform policy is very correct.

　　Mr. Sun Yat-sen also advocated "restricting capital," but it was only a simple call. Now, seeing in the Common Program that the state-owned economy is determined as the leading economy of the country, and private industry and commerce are guided to develop in the direction that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. This policy of taking both public and private interests into account, and at the same time benefiting both labor and capital, has been put forward by Director Chen Yun to adjust industry and commerce, taking care of many specific measures for private enterprises, all of which are practical and can be fully achieved. Through such a combination of public and private interests, making the five economic components support and coordinate with each other, the national economy can prosper and gradually industrialize, freeing itself from the shackles of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism, and entering a realm of prosperity, strength, and happiness. Isn't this the purpose of restricting capital? Therefore, I also very much agree with these measures.

　　We have overthrown the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and established the great People's Republic of China. This is the first major event in Chinese history, and at the same time, it is also a major event in the world. Since the establishment of the People's Government on October 1st last year, the four major classes have united under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and after eight months of efforts, except for Taiwan and Tibet, we have recovered all the territories, unified finance and economy, balanced revenue and expenditure, stabilized prices, and all political measures have achieved great results. In the future, we should further unite in the united front of the four major classes led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and fully implement the various reports of this meeting. This will be the great victory of the People's Republic of China.

    熊克武的发言
    【新华社二十一日讯】老同盟会员熊克武二十一日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    这次本人很荣幸地列席会议，听了各项重要报告，尤其关于土地改革和调整工商业的政策，感觉无上的欣快！这些政策都是多年来所希望所努力而不能实现的，现在都见诸事实了。这是中国共产党正确的领导，长期的苦斗，取得了划时代的革命胜利，才辟出改革和建设的大道；必然要由这些政策普遍地执行，才能够建设独立、自由、富强、统一的新中国。这是非常正确的道路，非常适切的政策。
    中国自近百年来，沦为半殖民地，国内的封建势力和国际的帝国主义相勾结，组成了半殖民地半封建的统治，压迫着广大的人民。这被压迫的广大人民，当然是占人口百分之八十以上的农民；在五四以后，无产阶级的工人所受的压迫，更加利害。在这样情势的国度里，要想推翻封建势力与帝国主义相结合的统治，除了工人、农人，和广大群众的力量，是没有其他办法的。本人于此曾领受过痛苦的经验与教训。在满清末年，我为反对这半殖民地半封建的统治，加入了同盟会，追随孙中山先生从事革命，在各地起义，如四川的成都、广安、叙府、江安诸役，和辛亥广州之役，蹈汤赴火，出死入生，不可谓不勇敢，然而成就却有限得很。辛亥革命虽然成了功，但结果是失败了。在辛亥革命的当时，是与群众一气的，但是，以后继续斗争，愈久而群众愈见减少，革命的成就更愈见渺茫，这是什么缘故呢？由今天看来，要想推翻帝国主义，封建主义，和后来发生的官僚资本主义，没有工农大众作基本的动力，没有小资产阶级、民族资产阶级结成的统一战线，尤其没有共产党这样的坚强领导，那里能够成功。由此更可以知道，当时虽有英勇的革命行动，只同于个人行为，对于社会改革，有何补益。共产党开拓了革命的新局面，知道没有将这些被敌人压迫得最利害而人数又最多的工人农人，在党的领导下组织起来，作为基本力量，加上所领导的统一战线，要想消灭强大而狡猾的三个敌人，那是不能想像的。个人虽然从事过革命，而没有什么成就，更不知道这样的方法和策略，深觉惭愧。然而，看见革命的成功，和中华人民共和国的长成；看见革命的理想以次实现，却是非常兴奋的。就土地改革说，中山先生首先主张“平均地权”，后来又提出“耕者有其田”的口号，但是，怎样实行？却没有提出具体的办法；由怎样的政党？怎样的政府？领导执行，在个人意识中亦模糊得很。现在听见刘副主席的报告，说明了土改的前途，指出了发展生产建设农业的道路，特别提出具体办法，非常周密妥当。毛主席曾说：“国家经济基本好转”，这样的改革措施，便是好转的特征。我想土地改革在当时只是一个口号，现在由共产党的领导，却具体实施起来了，这是个人非常拥护的。又回想解放战争之所以胜利，多得力于土地改革，更可以证明现行的土地改革政策是很正确的。
    中山先生亦曾提倡过“节制资本”，但也只成单纯的号召。现在看见共同纲领中，确定以国营经济作国家的领导经济，而于私营工商业，又引导他们向有益国计民生的方向发展。这种公私兼顾，同时亦是劳资两利的政策，经陈云主任提出调整工商业，照顾私营企业的许多具体办法，都是切合实际，可以完全做得到的。由这样的公私兼顾，使五种经济互相辅翼调协，国家经济便可由此繁荣起来，日趋工业化，解除半殖民地半封建的束缚，进到富强康乐的境域，这不是节制资本的目的么？所以这些措施，我也是非常同意的。
    我们推翻了帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义的统治，成立了伟大的中华人民共和国，这是中国有史以来的第一件大事，同时，也是世界上的一件大事。自去年十月一日人民政府成立以来，四大阶级在毛主席和共产党的领导下团结起来，经过八个月的努力除台湾与西藏外，收复了全部国土，统一财政经济，平衡收支，安定物价，以及关于政治的一切措施，都有巨大的成果，今后当在毛主席共产党所领导四大阶级的统一战线中，更加团结，把这次会议的各项报告充分地实现出来，这便是中华人民共和国的伟大胜利。
