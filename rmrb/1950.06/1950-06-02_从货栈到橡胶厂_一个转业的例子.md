　　From a Warehouse to a Rubber Factory
　　——An Example of a Career Change
　　By our reporter Lu Chaoqi

　　The Huacheng Rubber Factory, established with 1,900 bolts of Double Dragon white cloth, has only been around for four months, but it is already quite famous in Jinan. Its Yongli brand sneakers are selling well in Jinan, Xuzhou, Xi'an, Shijiazhuang, and Northeast China.

　　The predecessor of the Huacheng Rubber Factory was originally a jointly operated Xiecheng Warehouse, specializing in buying and selling tobacco leaves for customers, which changed its line of business in response to the government's call. The factory building still looks a bit like a warehouse. Its main equipment includes: one steam boiler, one rubber baking pot, two electric rubber pressing machines, and two unused machines for manufacturing bicycle inner and outer tubes. It employs 25 workers, and including the shareholders' families, a total of 49 people participate in production. Currently, it produces more than 270 pairs of various rubber shoes every day.

　　An official from the Jinan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce told me that since liberation, many industrial and commercial enterprises have changed their line of business (especially from commerce to industry), but the Huacheng Rubber Factory is considered the best in terms of finding the right path and having development prospects.

　　Changing one's line of business is not a simple matter. The Huacheng Rubber Factory, in the process of changing its business, encountered many difficulties.

　　Where to change to? This is the first question that everyone changing their business considers. Xiecheng Warehouse - the predecessor of the Huacheng Rubber Factory - struggled with this for more than half a year before finding the right path for the change. In April and May of last year, Manager Chen Xietang went to Tianjin to sell tobacco. Through a friend's introduction, he met the current factory director, Ma Shousan. At that time, Ma Shousan was a technician at the Tianjin Bohua Rubber Factory. He took Manager Chen to visit the Bohua Rubber Factory. Manager Chen saw that the equipment of the rubber factory was relatively simple, and it could be set up with a small amount of capital. Although the raw materials came from abroad, they were easily available in Jinan, which is close to Qingdao. Moreover, there were not many rubber factories in Jinan, and the sales were wide. Ma Shousan was also willing to help solve technical difficulties. Therefore, Manager Chen decided to switch to a rubber factory. After returning to Jinan and seeking the shareholders' consent, he began preparations for the change in July. The original employees who worked in the warehouse were also transferred to the rubber factory to learn technology. In October, all the machines were bought in Qingdao with 600 bolts of Double Dragon white cloth. During the months of installing the machines, the warehouse business was suspended, and the income was temporarily stopped, but the expenses still continued. Some of the shareholders, who originally lacked confidence, became somewhat discouraged. However, with the constant encouragement of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the factory's internal efforts to save expenses, they finally overcame this difficulty. On February 4th of this year, the first batch of goods left the factory.

　　Maintaining a certain quality of finished products, serving workers, peasants and citizens, and small profits and quick turnover are the most effective ways to open up commodity sales channels. The quality of rubber shoes produced by the Huacheng Rubber Factory is not much different from those produced in Tianjin and Shanghai, but the price is much cheaper. At that time, a dozen of Shanghai's Warrior brand rubber shoes sold for 500,000 yuan, while he only sold them for 320,000 yuan. For customers from other places, 5,000 yuan could be deducted per dozen to subsidize transportation costs, so everyone was willing to buy them. As soon as the goods left the factory, twelve stores became sales agents. This further increased their confidence and enthusiasm for developing production.

　　But new difficulties came. From the second half of March to the first half of April, it was the most difficult period for this newly established factory. At that time, prices went from stable to falling, and goods could not be sold. The original twelve sales agents also stopped selling. The Huacheng Rubber Factory almost died as a result. Under these difficult circumstances, in order to assist the capitalists in overcoming the difficulties, the workers' wages were already very low, but they did not demand full pay, reducing the capitalists' difficulties in capital turnover. On April 16th, the Huacheng Rubber Factory opened its own retail department. The original plan was for the retail department to sell 100 dozen shoes per week, but the actual sales exceeded the plan. In addition, the state-owned department stores helped to promote sales (sales through department stores accounted for 50 percent of the total output), and almost all of the daily products were sold out. With the active efforts of both labor and capital and the help of state-owned stores, the Huacheng Rubber Factory overcame this difficulty again.

　　Stable prices have created favorable conditions for the development of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises. The Huacheng Rubber Factory has deeply experienced this in the past four months. Manager Chen Xietang told me: When prices fluctuate, I always feel that the capital is too small and the turnover is difficult; now that prices are stable, how much money can buy how many raw materials, and I no longer worry about the finished products that are sold not being able to buy the original raw materials.

　　从货栈到橡胶厂
    ——一个转业的例子
    本报记者  陆超祺
    以一千九百匹双龙白布办起来的华成橡胶厂，虽然只有短短的四个月的历史，但在济南已经很出名了。它出品的永力牌球鞋，已畅销于济南、徐州、西安、石家庄和东北各地。
    华成橡胶厂的前身，原是一个专门代客买卖烟叶的合股经营的协成货栈，响应人民政府的号召转了业。厂房还有点像货栈的模样。它主要的设备，有：蒸汽锅一个，烤橡锅一个，电力压胶机两台，另外还有两台未用的制造自行车内外胎的机器。雇用职工二十五人，连股东的家属在内，总共有四十九人参加生产。现在每天产各种胶鞋二百七十余双。
    济南市工商局的一位同志告诉我，解放以来，工商业转业的（特别是由商业转到工业的）很多，但转得上门道的，并且有发展前途的，要算华成橡胶厂最好了。
    转业本来不是一件简单事。华成橡胶厂在转业的过程中，曾经遇到过许多困难。
    往那儿转？这是所有转业的人首先考虑的问题。协成货栈——华成橡胶厂的前身，为了这件事曾经苦恼过足足有半年多的时间，才摸到转业的门道。去年四、五月间，陈协堂经理去天津卖烟，经友人的介绍，他认识了现在的厂长马寿三。那时候，马寿山是天津博华橡胶厂的技师，带了陈经理去参观博华橡胶厂。陈经理看到橡胶厂的设备比较简单，需要资金不很大就可以办起来。原料虽然来自国外，但济南靠近青岛也容易买到。并且济南的橡胶厂不多，销路又广；马寿山又愿意帮助解决技术上的困难。于是，陈经理便决定转业橡胶厂。从天津回到济南征求股东同意后，七月起便开始筹备转业工作。原来在货栈工作的职工，也全部转入橡胶厂，学习技术。十月，以六百匹双龙白布在青岛买得全部机器。在装置机器的几个月里面，货栈业务停止了，收入随着暂时停止了，但开支还仍旧。原来部分信心不足的股东，有些心灰意冷了。但在工商局的不断鼓励下，工厂内部又尽量节约开支，终于度过了这个难关。今年二月四日第一批货物出厂了。
    保持一定的成品质量，为工农和市民服务，薄利多销，是打开商品销路的最有效办法。华成橡胶厂出品的胶鞋，质量与天津、上海出品的相差无几，而价格却便宜得多。当时上海出品的回力牌胶鞋每打五十万元，他只卖三十二万元，对外埠来客，每一打还可扣除五千元，补助运费，故人人乐意买。货物一出厂，马上就有十二家商店代销。这更增加了他们发展生产的信心和积极性。
    但新的困难来了。从三月下半月到四月上半月，是这个初建立的工厂的最困难时期。那时候，物价由平稳而趋下落，货物销不出去。原来那十二家代销商也不代销了。华成橡胶厂几乎因而夭折。在这种困难情况下，工人们为了协助资方克服困难，他们的工资原来本已很低，但他们没有要求发全薪，减少了资方资金周转的困难。四月十六日，华成橡胶厂又自己开设门市部。原计划门市部每周卖鞋一百打，实际的销售情形却超过了计划。再加上国营百货公司帮助推销（经由百货公司销售的占总产量的百分之五十），每天的产品几乎全部卖完。就在劳资双方积极设法和国营商店的帮助下，华成橡胶厂又战胜了这一次的困难。
    物价平稳，给正当的工商业创造了有利的发展条件。华成橡胶厂在过去的四个多月中，深深地体验到这一点。陈协堂经理对我说：在物价波动的时候，总觉得资金太小，周转困难；现在物价平稳了，有多少钱买多少原料，再也不愁卖出去的成品买不进原来的原料了。
