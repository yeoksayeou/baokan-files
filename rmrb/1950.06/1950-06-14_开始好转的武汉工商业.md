　　Wuhan's Industry and Commerce Begin to Improve
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Xiao Hang
    I. A New Turning Point Has Emerged
    The people of Wuhan have clearly seen the great power of the people's democratic system. This system, in a short period of time, reversed the twelve-year inflationary situation; and in a short period of time, led private industry and commerce to begin to emerge from serious difficulties.
    The changes in Wuhan's industry and commerce can be seen from the following figures.
    This situation is first reflected in the number of industrial and commercial households applying for suspension and opening of business. In March, 341 households applied for suspension, and 156 were approved. In April, 1,009 households applied for suspension, and 245 were approved. In the first ten days of May, the atmosphere of suspension was still strong, with 704 applications and 302 approvals (the above approvals include households that applied in the past but were approved later). By mid-May, the situation began to improve, with 239 applications and 201 approvals. By the last ten days of May, there was concrete evidence that Wuhan's private industry and commerce had stabilized. In ten days, only 101 households applied for suspension, while 344 households applied for opening, of which 238 were industrial. Comparing the approved figures for opening and suspension, the number of industrial and commercial households increased by 42. This is a phenomenon that has not occurred in recent months.
    This phenomenon is inseparable from the stability of finance and prices and the gradual activation of the market.
    First, let's talk about the price index. Taking December of last year as 100, prices have been rising since January of this year, reaching a peak in early March, with a total index of 213.4. Since mid-March, prices have fallen, and by early May, the total index had fallen to 138.36, rebounding to 140.87 in mid-May and continuing to rise to 146.53 in late May.
    The change in the financial situation is that bank deposits have gradually decreased, while loans and remittances have increased. Since March, the deposit figures of the Hankou Branch of the People's Bank of China have surged, reaching a peak on May 26, and then declining daily. By June 5, the deposit figures had decreased by 13%. The reduced amount has been largely invested in the market. The changes in the deposit and loan figures of private banks and firms are also obvious. Comparing June 1 with April 29, deposits have decreased from 46.2 billion to 42.3 billion, and loans have increased from 28.9 billion to 35.5 billion. As for the remittance situation, according to the statistics of the Hankou Branch, the number of remittances increased by more than 33% in May compared with April, and the number of remittances increased by nearly 20%. The increased number mainly appeared in late May. It should be noted that after the above funds were invested in the market, the market and financial situation did not fluctuate and remained stable.
    II. The Ideological Concerns of Businessmen Begin to Dissipate
    Before May, the ideology of Wuhan's business community was in a state of chaos. They suspected that the government "says it is practicing New Democracy, but it is actually practicing Socialism," and worried that the relationship between the "four friends" would change. Some people even made a couplet for this, proposing the so-called: "Hanging the red flag, the five stars are uncertain; twisting the Yangko, it's difficult to advance or retreat."
    However, since Chairman Mao proposed the adjustment of industry and commerce and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's "May 1st" speech was published, the ideology of the business community began to change. More progressive people believed that the Communist Party said what it meant and did what it said, and began to turn from pessimism to stability. However, because Wuhan's public enterprises were developing retail business at that time, they were somewhat suspicious, so they eagerly asked the government to "turn slogans into actions."
    The third Wuhan Municipal People's Representatives Conference held from May 3 to 7 cleared up these doubts. Cotton merchant Zhang Yinqiu said: "After the representative conference, people in the business community were overjoyed and felt hopeful." On June 2, at a meeting to welcome the Guilin business delegation, Yu Jintang, manager of Wuhan Qunye Company, introduced a new couplet from Wuchang, which read:
    "Hanging the red flag, the five stars are fixed; twisting the Yangko, advancing steadily."
    Once the confused thoughts of the business community were clarified, their attitude towards business turned positive. Chen Shiyong, director of the preparatory committee of the Wuchang Rice Milling Industry Association, encouraged business owners who were preparing to suspend operations to try their best to persevere and wait for improvement. As a result, several companies, such as leather merchant Xiong Xiangtai and general merchandise store Yuancheng Zhangji, dispelled the idea of suspending operations. More than ten companies in the department store and cigarette industries, such as Huachang, which had already reported suspension of operations, are now preparing to resume operations. Representatives of the coal industry said that most of the more than 40 coal shops that had been closed could also resume operations. Thus, by late May, the number of businesses opening exceeded the number of businesses closing.
    III. Relying on the Joint Efforts of Three Aspects
    The reasons for the beginning of improvement in Wuhan's industry and commerce come from three aspects. First and foremost, the main aspect is the methods adopted by the government, such as commissioned processing and acquisition of finished products. The Central South Regional Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation has signed a comprehensive commissioned processing contract with Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill. During the validity of the contract, the raw materials and products of the yarn are all supplied and purchased by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation is also negotiating contracts with yarn mills such as Shenxin, Yuhua, and Zhenhuan. Before the contract is signed, it will first lend 1,500 dan of raw cotton to Shenxin and Yuhua each, and 50 pieces of cotton yarn to Zhenhuan, in order to maintain production. In order to prevent the price of yarn from plummeting and reduce the difficulties of private manufacturers, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, in addition to giving priority to private factories to sell finished products on the market, also directly purchased 2,900 pieces of cotton yarn from Wuhan's four major yarn mills (No. 1 Cotton Mill, Shenxin, Yuhua, and Zhenhuan). In addition, the Central South Regional Company of the China National Department Store Corporation has recently invested 18.96 billion yuan in the entire region to purchase finished products and pay processing wages. In Hankou alone, it has purchased 11,867 pieces of various fabrics, 153 pieces of silk, 28 pieces of cotton yarn, 2,550 boxes of soap, 751 baskets of perfumed soap, and 7,499 baskets of matches. In late May, it signed eight contracts, commissioning Wuhan Yunji Clothing Industry Cooperative and others to manufacture shirts, shorts, mosquito nets, and pillow cores. Except for the exchange of cotton yarn for mosquito nets, without calculating wages, other processing wages have been paid more than 25 million yuan. In this way, Wuhan's textile industry can fully maintain production. Other manufacturers have also received strong support.
    Another aspect is labor-management consultation and improved management. In very difficult factories and shops, as long as the capitalists are willing to continue to maintain operations, the workers take the initiative to consult with the capitalists, put forward suggestions for improving management, and voluntarily reduce wages and increase production to reduce costs and maintain operations. The workers of Suihua Match Factory voluntarily reduced their wages by one-tenth. At the same time, they increased working hours, and did not want wages for the extra four carts of matches per month. Suihua's machines were already old and dilapidated, and the workers had made great efforts to increase the output from 40 baskets per month last year to 110 baskets in March this year. Now, the workers say: "In order to overcome the current difficulties, we have decided to increase the output to 120 baskets." This touching spirit of hard work encouraged the capitalists. Now the capitalists are preparing to buy new machines.
    The strong support of the People's Government and the active support of the workers have improved the management enthusiasm of many businessmen compared with the past. At the labor-management consultation meeting, the manager of Suihua Match Factory disclosed the accounts and reported the real situation of the business, allowing the workers to study; and accepted the workers' suggestions, reviewed the problems in management, and promised to abolish the feudal foreman system. After sincere consultation between labor and management, the factory's costs were reduced by 10%, sales increased, and maintaining operations was no longer a problem. Some small shops have begun to cooperate. For example, ten rice shops such as Hexinggong on Yongqing Street in Hankou have difficulty in operating due to small capital and small storefronts, which cannot undertake larger transactions. Now, ten have been combined into two, greatly saving expenses and saving the crisis of suspension of operations. For example, 17 small shops in the hardware, copper, and iron industries are also unable to maintain operations due to excessive expenses and small turnover. With the assistance of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, they are preparing to form the "Dalian Metal Industrial Raw Material Company" to operate mainly in copper, lead, and tin, and will open soon. Some businessmen have appropriately reduced expenses. For example, the manager of Cao Xiangtai in the grocery industry saves more than 10 million yuan per month and plans to increase the capital by 15 dan of rice per month.
    All indications show that Wuhan's private industry and commerce has begun to turn to stability, and the general industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood has begun to be maintained.
    IV. The Business Community Must Strive to Reform
    Wuhan's industry and commerce has only just stabilized, and many complex issues remain to be resolved. At present, in addition to the government's decision to provide assistance, what is more important is that businessmen must be determined to improve the shortcomings in management. At present, a considerable number of businessmen simply ask the government for assistance, giving reasonable profits; and ask workers to reduce wages and increase production to reduce costs. The government and workers have made or are making efforts in various aspects. But this alone cannot solve all the problems. The most obvious example is No. 1 Cotton Mill. In the past, the Central South Regional Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation had lost 318 pieces of cotton yarn in three commissioned processing from the factory. According to the latest processing conditions, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation still loses more than 90,000 yuan per piece of yarn and more than 15,000 yuan per piece of cloth. Even so, it is said that the factory is not profitable enough. So where is the crux of the problem? According to the report of the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions on May 17, in private enterprises, the phenomenon of large waste, low production efficiency, and thus high costs is serious, and No. 1 Cotton Mill is a typical example. The cost of 20-count lightweight red ball cotton yarn in the factory requires 625 jin of cotton per piece (the capitalists estimate that 680 jin is needed), which is about 9% higher than in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. What is the reason? The first is that the labor allocation and the proportion of employees are very unreasonable. On average, 614 people are required for every 10,000 spindles, which is more than five times higher than the fixed number of 120 people per 10,000 spindles in the Northeast yarn mills. The factory has 6,004 workers and 208 staff members, and the ratio of workers to staff members is 29 to 1; while the number of non-technical staff members is more than twice that of technical staff members. Many staff members came in through "connections", and some senior staff members only take money and eat, but from a business point of view, they have no effect. The second is that the wage system is even more unreasonable. Some assistant engineers receive 286 points, while ordinary clerks receive 338 points, and nominal commissioners receive 440 points. The workers' hourly wages are as many as 84 levels, all squeezed between 103 and 170 points, with a grade difference of only one or two points, and the phenomenon of egalitarianism is very obvious. The wages of service personnel are even more unreasonable. Some sweepers in the business office receive 221 points, which is much more than the 140 points generally received by technical workers.
    Finally, there is no accurate statistical reporting system and a lack of cost accounting. In the factory daily report, there are only figures for product production or raw material consumption, but there are never records of defective products or waste. The figures for the factory, inventory, and sales are always inconsistent, and it is impossible to accurately calculate profits and losses. If the above unreasonable phenomena are not reformed, production cannot be fundamentally improved. Therefore, improving management methods by businessmen is an important link for further improvement.

　　开始好转的武汉工商业
    本报特派记者  萧航
    一、新的转机已经出现
    武汉人民清晰地看到了人民民主制度的巨大力量。这个制度，在短时间内扭转了十二年来的通货膨胀局面；又在短时间内领导私营工商业开始从严重的困难中跨了出来。
    从下述的数字，可以看出武汉工商业情况的改变。
    这种情况，首先表现在申请停歇业与开业的工商户方面。三月份，有三四一户申请停歇业，核准了一五六户。四月份申请停歇业的达一零零九户，核准二四五户。五月上旬，停歇业的空气依然很浓，申请户达七零四，核准了三零二。五月中旬，情况开始好转，申请户为二三九，核准二零一（上述各项核准户均包括过去申请后来始核准的户）。到五月下旬，已经有确切的根据，证明武汉私营工商业稳定了下来。十天内，申请停歇业的只有一零一户，而申请开业的却有三四四户，其中工业占了二三八户。拿申请开业与停歇业的核准数字作个比较，工商业户共增加四二户。这是近几个月来没有的现象。
    这一现象是和金融物价稳定，市场渐趋活跃分不开的。
    先说物价指数。以去年十二月为一百，从今年一月起，物价一直上升，到三月上旬达到了最高峰，总指数是二一三·四。三月中旬以来，物价下落，到五月上旬，总指数下降为一三八·三六，中旬回升至一四零·八七，下旬续升为一四六·五三。
    金融情况的变化是，银行存款已渐减少，放款和汇兑均有增加。从三月以后，中国人民银行汉口分行的存款数字激增，到五月二十六日达到了高峰，此后逐日下降，至六月五日，存款数字已减少百分之十三。减少的数字，已大部投入市场。私营行庄存放款数字的变化也很显然。以六月一日与四月二十九日比较，存款已从四六二亿减少至四二三亿，放款由二八九亿增至三五五亿。至于汇兑的情况，据汉口分行统计，五月份与四月份比较，汇入数字增加百分之三十三强，汇出数字增加将近百分之二十。增加的数字主要是在五月下旬出现的。应当说明，当上述各项资金投入市场之后，市场、金融情况并没有发生波动，依然保持着稳定状态。
    二、工商业者的思想顾虑开始解除
    五月以前，武汉工商界思想上是一片混乱，他们怀疑政府“说的是新民主主义，行的是社会主义”，耽心四个朋友的关系会起变化。有人为此还做了一付对联，提出所谓：“挂红旗，五星不定；扭秧歌，进退两难。”了。
    但是自从毛主席提出调整工商业及刘少奇副主席的“五一”讲话发表以后，工商业界的思想开始起了变化。比较进步的人士，相信共产党说得到做得到，开始由悲观转向稳定。但因当时武汉公营企业正在开展零售业务，他们又有些怀疑，因而急于要求政府“把口号变成行动”。
    五月三日至七日举行的武汉市第三次各界代表会议，扫清了这些疑虑。棉花商张吟秋说：“开过代表会议，工商界人士喜形于色，都感到有了希望。”六月二日，在欢迎桂林工商代表团的会上，武汉群业公司经理余金堂介绍了来自武昌的一付新对联，这对联写道：
    “挂红旗，五星已定；扭秧歌，稳步前进。”
    工商业者的混乱思想一经澄清，对营业的态度乃转趋积极。武昌碾米业公会筹备会主任陈世庸，鼓励预备报停的业户勉力支持，等待好转。于是，皮商熊祥泰、杂货业的元成彰记等数家，打消了报停的念头。百货业、香烟业的华昌等十多家原已报停，现在又筹备复业。煤炭业的代表说，已经停业的四十多家煤炭店，也有大部分可以复业。这样，到五月下旬，开业户竟超过了停业户。
    三、依靠了三个方面的共同努力
    武汉工商业开始好转的原因，来自三个方面。首先而且是主要的方面，是政府所采取的委托加工、收购成品等方法。中国花纱布公司中南区公司已与武汉第一纱厂订立了全面委托加工合约，在合约有效期间，纱的原料和产品，全由花纱布公司供给和收购。花纱布公司并正与申新、裕华、震寰等纱厂洽订合约，在合约签订之前，先拨借给申新、裕华原棉各一千五百担，震寰棉纱五十件，借以维持生产。为使纱价不致暴跌，以减少私营厂商的困难，花纱布公司除在市场上尽先让私厂出售成品外，并直接收购了武汉四大纱厂（第一纱厂、申新、裕华、震寰）的棉纱二千九百件。另外，中国百货公司中南区公司，近在全区投资一百八十九亿六千万元，用以收购成品，支付加工工资。仅在汉口一地，现已收购各种布匹一一、八六七匹，绸缎一五三匹，棉纱二十八件，肥皂二、五五零箱，香皂七五一箩，火柴七、四九九篓。并于五月下旬签订了八个合同，委托武汉云记服装工业社等承制衬衫、短裤、蚊帐、枕蕊等。除棉纱换蚊帐不计工资外，其他加工工资已付二千五百余万元。这样一来，武汉的纺织业已全能维持生产。其他厂商也得到有力支持。
    再一个方面是，劳资协商，改善经营。在十分困难的工厂商店里面，只要资方愿意继续维持经营，工人即主动与资方协商，提出改善经营的意见，并自愿减薪、增产，使成本降低，把营业维持下来。燧华火柴厂工人自动减薪十分之一。同时，增加工时，每月多出的四车火柴，也不要工资。燧华的机器原已破旧，工人已尽极大努力将产量从去年的每月四十篓，提高到今年三月的一百一十篓。如今，工人们说：“为了度过当前的困难，我们决定再把产量提高到一百二十篓。”这种感人的努力生产的精神，鼓励了资方。现在资方正准备换购新机器。
    人民政府的大力扶助和工人的积极支持，使不少工商业者的经营积极性较前提高了。燧华火柴厂经理在劳资协商会议上把账目公开出来，报告了营业的真实情况，让工人研究；并接受工人建议，检讨了管理上的毛病，答应取消封建的工头制度。经过劳资双方的推诚协商，该厂成本降低百分之十，销路增加，维持营业已不成问题。有些小商店已开始联营。如汉口永清街的合兴公等十家米店，由于资金微薄，铺面太小，不能承揽较大的买卖，使经营发生困难，现在十家已联合为两家，开支大大节省，挽救了停业的危机。又如五金业、铜器业、铁业的十七家小商店，也因开支太大，营业额小，不能维持，经市工商局协助，正筹组“大联金属工业原料公司”，以经营铜铅锡为主，不日即可开张。有些工商业者已适当减少了费用。如杂货业的曹祥泰经理，每月节省一千余万元，打算每月增加资本十五担米。
    种种迹象表明，武汉私营工商业已经开始转向了稳定，一般有利于国计民生的工商业已经开始维持下来。
    四、工商界要努力改革
    武汉工商业只是刚刚稳定下来，有不少复杂的问题尚待解决。就目前看，在政府已经决定扶助之外，更重要的是工商业者要决心改善经营上的弊病。现在，有相当多的工商业者，单纯地要求政府扶助，给以合理的利润；要求工人减薪、增产，以降低成本。所有这一些，政府和工人，已经作了或正在作着各方面的努力。但是仅仅如此，并不能解决所有的问题。最显明的例子是第一纱厂。过去，中南区花纱布公司向该厂的三次委托加工，已经亏损了三一八件棉纱。就最近的加工条件来说，花纱布公司仍然每件纱要亏九万多元，每匹布亏一万五千多元。即使这样，据说该厂并不够本。那么问题的症结在那里呢？据武汉市总工会筹委会五月十七日报告，在私营企业中，浪费大，生产效率低，因而成本高的现象严重存在，而以第一纱厂为典型。该厂二十支轻磅红球棉纱每件成本需六二五斤棉花（资方估计需六八零斤），较之上海、天津、青岛等地高出百分之九左右。原因是什么呢？首先是劳力配备、职工比例很不合理。平均每一万个锭子要六一四人，与东北纱厂定员每万锭一二零人左右比较，超过五倍。全厂六、○○四个工人，二○八个职员，工人和职员的比例是二九比一；而非技术职员比技术职员则多一倍有余。许多职员是“走门子”进来的，有些高级职员都是只管拿钱吃饭，从业务上说，却没有什么作用。其次是工资制更不合理。有的助理工程师拿二八六分，普通课员反而拿三三八分，挂名的专员竟拿四四零分。工人的计时工资达八十四级之多，都挤在一○三至一七○分之间，级差仅一分两分，平均主义的现象非常明显。勤杂人员的工资更是不合理，营业处的扫地工人有的拿二二一分，比技术工人一般拿一四○分还多得多。
    最后是没有精确的统计报告制度，缺乏成本核算。在工厂日报表上，只有生产品或原料消耗的数字，而从来没有废品、浪费的纪录。出厂、库存、营业三方面的数字，又总是不相符合，盈亏如何，也就无法精确计算。上述这些不合理的现象，如不加以改革，生产是没法根本搞好的。因此，工商业者改善经营方法，乃是进一步好转的重要环节。
                                   六月七日写于武汉
