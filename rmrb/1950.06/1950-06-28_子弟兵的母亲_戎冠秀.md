The Mother of the Soldiers—Rong Guanxiu

　　Zhang Zhi Liang Deshou Cui Weiming

　　The mother of the soldiers—Rong Guanxiu, from Xiapan Song Village, Jianping Fifth District, Hebei, is fifty-one years old this year. When we arrived in her village, whether we asked the cadres or the masses, "How is Rong Guanxiu's production?" they all said, "Although she is old, she is very active in production! She gets up early and goes to bed late, works diligently, and works very happily at home and in the fields!" On June 12th, after breakfast, we arrived at her house. She was in the field and hadn't returned yet. Soon, the old woman came back with a basket full of tender grass. She said with a smile: "Grain is very scarce here, and raising pigs depends on grass and wild vegetables. I get a basket in the morning and a basket in the afternoon every day. This is a fixed job every day." We looked at her pigs, which were fat and big.

　　She built two houses this spring. In addition to employing carpenters, she and her two daughters-in-law did the work of carrying adobe, mixing mud, and carrying stones. It didn't cost much to build the two houses. The harvest was bad last year, and there was not enough grain to eat this year. She relied on her own labor and that of her two daughters-in-law to earn money to subsidize the family.

　　The village branch secretary, Song Hong, died of illness this spring, leaving only his wife and two children. Because no one was working, life was difficult. She voluntarily asked her husband, Li You, and her second son to help Song Hong's family hoe corn for four days. And comforted them saying, "If you have any work, just tell us! We will help you do it." An old man in the village has his single and cotton clothes made by her every year.

　　During the Anti-Japanese War, the higher authorities awarded her a mule. Whoever in the village wanted to borrow the mule to grind, deliver manure, or plow the land…she was willing to lend it to them. Even the nearby Wanzi and Shangpan Song villages also borrowed it from her. Speaking of Rong Guanxiu's mule, the villagers all said: "She is not conservative, as long as it is idle, she will lend it to anyone!" What is most touching is that during the busy farming season, she and her daughter-in-law grinded grain, and lent the mule to the needy villagers to deliver manure and plow the land.

　　The year before last, she tried planting one mu and one fen of Baimaya corn, and the yield was very high, yielding one shi and six dou (large dou). Although the harvest was bad last year, it still yielded four dou more than other land. She actively promoted it, so that most of the families in the village changed to this kind of corn. This year, the nearby Shaping and Guanyintang villages also went to her house to exchange for improved varieties. This year, she is also trying to plant seven fen of Huanong No. 4 millet, in preparation for promotion.

　　She runs a large vegetable garden, planting beans, cucumbers, eggplants, scallions and other vegetables. She didn't know how to grow a vegetable garden three years ago. After two years of learning, she has mastered a set of techniques for growing gardens. Planting, watering, weeding, and fertilizing are all done by her own hands. The entire family's vegetable supply is entirely provided by her.

　　子弟兵的母亲—戎冠秀
    张植　梁得寿　崔未明
    子弟兵的母亲——戎冠秀，河北建屏五区下盘松村人，今年五十一岁。我们到了她的村子里，无论问干部或群众：“戎冠秀生产怎样？”他们都说：“她虽然老了，生产可积极啦！早起晚睡，勤劳生产，家里地里干的很欢！”六月十二日，早饭过后我们到了她家。她在地里，还没回来。不久，这老人提着满满的一篮嫩草回来了。她笑嘻嘻地说：“这里粮食很缺，养猪靠草靠野菜。俺每天早晨一篮子，后晌一篮子。这是每天定死的活。”我们看看她的猪，喂得又肥又大。
    她今春修盖了两间房子。除用木匠工外，背坯、和泥、担石头，都是她和两个儿媳妇做的。花钱不多，就把两间房子盖起来了。去年年景坏，今年粮食不够吃。她靠自己和两个儿媳妇的劳动，赚钱补贴家用。
    该村支书宋宏在今春病死，家里只剩下老婆和两个孩子，因无人劳动，生活困难。她便自动叫男人李有和她二小子帮助宋宏家锄玉茭四天。并安慰她们说：“你有活就说吧！我们帮助你做”。该村有一老汉，每年单、棉衣，都是她给做的。
    抗战时期，上级奖给她一头骡子。村里谁要借这骡子推碾、送粪、耕地……，她都愿借给人们使。甚至附近的湾子、上盘松等村也有向她借用的。提起戎冠秀的骡子，村里的老乡都说：“人家可不保守，只要闲着，谁也借给！”最使人感动的是：在农忙时，她和媳妇推碾，将骡子借给困难的乡亲送粪、耕地。
    前年她试种了一亩一分白马牙玉茭，产量很大，打一石六斗（大斗）。去年虽年景不好，也比其他地多打四斗。她便积极宣传推广，使本村大部人家都换了这种玉蜀黍。今年附近的沙坪、观音堂等村也都去她家换取优良品种。她今年又试种七分地的华农四号谷，准备推广。
    她经营了一个大的菜园，种着豆角、黄瓜、茄子、葱等菜蔬。前三年她还不会种菜园，经过二年的学习，她已能掌握种园地的一套技术。种、浇、锄、施肥，都是她亲手干。全家吃菜完全由她供给。
