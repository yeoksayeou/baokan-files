　　American Imperialist Conspiracy to Suppress Japanese Democratic Movement
　　Illegal Sentencing of Eight Japanese Patriots
    All-Japan Federation of Trade Union Liaison Committee Calls on People to Continue the Struggle
    [Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch] Tokyo dispatch from Reuters and Agence France-Presse: The eight Japanese patriots illegally arrested by the American occupation authorities on May 30th were arbitrarily sentenced to long-term hard labor by a military tribunal appointed by MacArthur on the 3rd. Kinji Onishi, an employee of the *Asahi Shimbun* newspaper, was sentenced to ten years of hard labor for the so-called crime of "plotting to disobey the occupation forces." Six employees, including Shiro Kataoka, Hideo Yoshida, Minoru Maeda, and university students Shigeru Akimoto, Kunio Shimizu, and Tetsuo Yasuda, were sentenced to seven years of hard labor, and employee Soichi Sodeyama was sentenced to five years of hard labor. After the sentencing, the eight Japanese patriots were escorted to Sugamo Prison in Tokyo under the strict surveillance of American guards.
    The facts prove that this "trial" was a planned conspiracy by the American occupation authorities aimed at打击 striking at the rising Japanese people's movement. After dispatching special agents to create a so-called "violent incident" of assaulting occupation forces personnel in the Imperial Palace Plaza on May 30th, the American occupation authorities immediately went to Hibiya Park to arrest people and set up a military court to conduct "trials" overnight from May 31st. As the "trial" was about to end, the defendant's defense lawyer revealed the court's conspiracy, saying: "I want to remind the court that certain elements are obstructing the democratic movement and creating disputes through provocative actions, using this as a means to suppress the real democratic movement." Therefore, the defendant's defense lawyer said: "The responsibility for this incident should be borne by these elements, not by the defendants." Although the defendant's reasons were sufficient, Calvin Newton, the American prosecutor of the military court, still arbitrarily demanded that the defendants be given "the heaviest possible punishment."
    This illegal verdict by the American occupation authorities has aroused great anger among the Japanese people. The All-Japan Federation of Trade Union Liaison Committee, the largest labor organization in Japan, issued a statement on the 4th, calling on the Japanese people to unite with all democratic forces in the world to fight against the fascists and their accomplices. The statement, after praising the eight patriots for their struggle for world peace and Japanese national independence, said: "We must continue to struggle until the number of patriots increases to tens of millions." The committee has issued appeals to the World Federation of Trade Unions and other world democratic organizations, requesting assistance to rescue the eight patriots "convicted" by the American military court.

　　美帝阴谋镇压日民主运动  非法判决日本八名爱国者
    全日工会联络委会号召人民继续斗争
    【新华社五日讯】据路透社、法新社东京讯：五月三十日被美国占领当局非法逮捕的日本爱国者八人，已于三日被麦克阿瑟任命的军事法庭专横地判处长期苦役。《朝日新闻》报馆的职工大西金次，以所谓“图谋不服从占领军”的罪名，被判处十年苦役。职工片冈四郎、吉田秀夫、前田实、大学生秋元茂、清水邦雄、安田哲雄等六人被判七年苦役，职工袖山五一被判五年苦役。在宣判以后，日本八名爱国者已在美国卫兵的严密监视下，被解至东京的小营监狱。
    事实证明，这次“审讯”乃是美国占领当局旨在打击高涨中的日本人民运动的有计划的阴谋行动。美国占领当局在派遣特务分子，于五月三十日在皇宫广场制造了所谓殴打占领军人员的“暴行事件”以后，立即去日比谷公园捕人，并设立军事法庭，自五月三十一日起，连夜进行“审讯”。在“审讯”将要终结时，被告辩护律师曾揭露法庭的阴谋称：“我要提醒法庭注意，即若干分子正在阻挠民主运动，并以挑拨性行动来制造纠纷事件，借此作为镇压真正的民主运动的手段。”因此，被告辩护律师说：“这一事件的责任应由这些分子来负担，而不应由被告来负担。”虽然被告方面的理由十分充足，但军事法庭的美国检察官卡尔文·纽顿仍专横地要求予被告们以“可能的最重的刑罚”。
    美国占领当局这一非法判决，引起了日本人民的巨大愤怒。日本最大的劳工组织——全日工会联络委员会于四日发表声明，号召日本人民与全世界所有民主力量联合起来，和法西斯分子及其同伙作斗争。声明在赞扬八名爱国者为世界和平与日本民族独立所进行的斗争后说：“我们一定要继续斗争，直到爱国者的数目增加至千万而后止”。该委员会已向世界工会联合会以及其他世界民主团体发出呼吁，要求援救被美国军事法庭判“罪”的八名爱国者。
