	Benefiting Both Labor and Capital to Develop Production
	Tianjin and Tangshan's Three Major Private Cotton Mills
	Achieve Profitable Operations and Pay Dividends
	Encouraging the Business Community and Boosting Confidence
	[Tianjin News] According to the Tianjin Daily, the Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Tangshan Huaxin textile mills, all privately owned in Tianjin, have achieved substantial profits over the past year due to the correct implementation of the policy of benefiting both labor and capital to develop production. All three factories distributed full-year dividends for last year in April. Hengyuan Cotton Mill had not distributed dividends for nearly three years, while Beiyang and Huaxin had not distributed them for a year and a half. According to the management of Hengyuan Cotton Mill, the factory has made a profit of approximately 60 billion RMB since liberation. The dividend distributed this time was 5% of the total capital stock, accounting for 2% of the total profit, or 1.2 billion RMB. Beiyang Cotton Mill's profit was no less than Hengyuan's, and its dividend distribution amounted to 1 billion RMB. Huaxin Cotton Mill had inventories of more than 17,900 dan of cotton, 830-plus bolts of cotton cloth, and over 1,000 pieces of cotton yarn. Its dividend distribution totaled 400,000 "discount units" (折实单位).

	In the early days of Tianjin's liberation, the labor-capital relations at Hengyuan and Beiyang mills were very abnormal, and labor discipline was quite lax. Later, with the correct guidance and education from the People's Government and the trade union, labor-capital relations gradually improved, and production efficiency increased accordingly. At the end of last year, both factories reasonably adjusted wages, further boosting the workers' production enthusiasm. Since February of this year, the two factories have successively implemented democratic management, established labor-capital consultation meetings, and formulated various production management systems, such as attendance systems, reward and punishment systems, workshop work methods, and production inspection systems, which further enhanced workers' production initiative and greatly developed production.

	The Tianjin Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company signed processing and sales contracts with Hengyuan and Beiyang, which strongly promoted the development of production in both factories.

	The new processing and sales contracts signed by the Tianjin Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company with Hengyuan and Beiyang powerfully promoted the development of production in these two factories. In March of last year, the unit output of yarn at Hengyuan Cotton Mill was 0.664 pounds, and the unit output of cloth was 30.195 yards. In April of this year, the unit production of yarn increased by 20.9%, and cloth increased by 16%. The rate of first-quality cloth reached 98.7%, setting a new record for the factory. In March of last year, the unit output of yarn at Beiyang Cotton Mill was 0.608 pounds. By April of this year, it reached 0.865 pounds, an increase of 42% compared to the previous period.

	Due to normal labor-capital relations, increased worker production enthusiasm, production development, and increased profits, the confidence of the capitalists in management has also greatly increased. Wages have been appropriately increased, and the lives and welfare of employees have also seen significant improvements. For example, both Hengyuan and Beiyang mills have improved their medical and health facilities compared to the past. Hengyuan has also implemented a relatively complete labor insurance system. Currently, Hengyuan and Huaxin mills are planning to expand production. According to Hengyuan manager Bian Jieqing, the factory plans to purchase spindles from Shanghai and build a new factory in Xi'an. Huaxin is also preparing to purchase a large number of spindles and plans to build a second factory. The factory building is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in September, at which time 500 looms can be put into operation.

	[Another Dispatch] After the Tianjin Daily published the news that the three textile mills, Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Huaxin, had achieved profitable operations and universally distributed full-year dividends for last year, the Tianjin business community was greatly encouraged and generally believed that this was a major event for Tianjin's industrial sector, greatly boosting their confidence in management. Some capitalists who knew the management of Hengyuan Cotton Mill immediately called the factory to inquire about the reasons for the profits and their experience. The shareholders of the three factories were overjoyed. The employees of the three factories unanimously stated that they would continue to work hard under the policy of "developing production and benefiting both labor and capital" to further increase production. Bi Mingqi, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Zhu Jiesheng, General Manager of the private Renli Industrial Company Carpet Factory, also delivered speeches, unanimously believing that the production development and abundant profits of the three major cotton mills, including Hengyuan, were the result of the correct implementation of the People's Government's policy of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." This fully demonstrates that investing in production undertakings beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood has a bright future and can obtain substantial profits as scheduled. They hoped that people enthusiastic about developing production undertakings would not hesitate to invest idle capital in legitimate industry and commerce, which would not only enable them to obtain dividends on schedule and guarantee personal income but also benefit the development of the entire social and economic undertaking.

　　劳资两利发展生产
    天津唐山三大私营纱厂    
    经营获利提发股息
    工商界受到鼓励经营信心提高
    【天津讯】据天津日报消息：津市私营恒源、北洋及唐山私营华新等三大纺织厂，由于正确执行了劳资两利发展生产的政策，一年来获利甚丰。均于四月份普遍发放去年全年股息。恒源纱厂已将近三年未发股息，北洋、华新两厂也有一年半未发股息。据恒源纱厂资方自称：该厂自解放后以来，盈利约达人民币六百余亿元，此次所发股息系按每股资金总额的百分之五发放，共占盈利总额的百分之二，即十二亿元。北洋纱厂盈利亦不下于恒源，其所发股息计十亿元。华新纱厂仅存货即有棉花一万七千九百多担，棉布八百三十多匹，棉纱千余件；所发股息共四十万个折实单位。
    天津解放初期，恒源、北洋两厂劳资关系，曾经很不正常，劳动纪律相当松弛。后经人民政府及工会的正确指导与教育，劳资关系日趋改善，生产效率随之上升。去年年底，两厂都合理地调整了工资，工人生产情绪进一步提高。从今年二月起，两厂先后实行了民主管理，成立了劳资协商会议，订立了各种生产管理制度，如考勤制度、奖惩制度、车间工作法及生产检查制度等，更提高了工人的生产积极性，使生产获得很大发展。
    花纱布公司与恒源、北洋订立加工、包销合同，有力地推动了两厂生产的发展。
    天津花纱布公司与恒源、北洋两厂新订的加工、包销合同，有力地推动了这两个工厂生产的发展。去年三月份，恒源纱厂纱的单位产量是○·六六四磅，布的单位产量是三○·一九五码；今年四月，该厂纱的单位生产量提高了百分之二○·九，布提高了百分之一六，正布率达到百分之九八·七，创造了该厂的空前纪录。去年三月份，北洋纱厂纱的单位产量是○·六○八磅；到今年四月份，达到了○·八六五磅，较前提高了百分之四二。
    由于劳资关系的正常，工人生产积极性的提高，生产发展，利润增加，资方经营的信心也大大提高，工资适当增加了，职工生活及福利事业也有了显著改善，如恒源及北洋两厂，在医疗卫生设备上，都较前改善。恒源并实行了较完善的劳保办法。现恒源、华新两厂，正计划扩大生产。据恒源经理边洁清谈，该厂准备从上海购买纱锭，在西安建一新厂。华新亦准备购买大批纱锭，并计划修建第二厂，现正修筑厂房，预计九月份完工，届时可有布机五百台开动。
    【又讯】天津日报发表了私营恒源、北洋、华新三纺织厂经营获利，普遍提发去年全年股息的消息后，津市工商界受到很大鼓励，普遍认为这是津市工业界一大喜事，大大提高了自己的经营信心。有些和恒源纱厂资方相识的资本家，看到消息，立即用电话向该厂资方探询盈利原因和经验。三个厂的股东，更是高兴万分。三厂职工，则一致表示：决在“发展生产，劳资两利”政策下，继续努力，进一步提高生产。津市工商业联合会副主任委员毕鸣岐、私营仁立实业公司地毯厂总经理朱继圣等，并发表谈话，一致认为：恒源等三大纱厂的生产发展和获利丰厚，是人民政府正确执行“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”政策的结果；这充分说明了投资有益于国计民生的生产事业是有着光辉的前途的，是能够如期获得丰厚利润的。希望热心于发展生产事业的人士们，毫不犹豫地把游资投向正当工商业；这将不但可以按期取得股息，保障个人收益，且将有利于整个社会经济事业的发展。
