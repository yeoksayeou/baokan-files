　　Xinhua News Agency, London, June 4th: The Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress held a plenary meeting in London from May 31st to June 1st. Professor Bernal, Mrs. Gordon, Robertson, and D'Arboussier successively served as chairmen of the meetings. In addition to the members of the Executive Bureau and the secretaries of the Standing Committee, representatives of the peace committees of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden, as well as outstanding democratic fighters from various countries, attended the meeting.

　　The Executive Bureau discussed the development of the signature campaign around the world for the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. The Executive Bureau noted with satisfaction the considerable achievements of this campaign and decided to take new measures to further promote it.

　　To this end, the Executive Bureau adopted the following important resolution.

　　The resolution of the Executive Bureau first pointed out: The Executive Bureau notes with satisfaction the fact that the movement to ban atomic weapons has made great progress since its launch, and that to date, more than 100 million signatures have been received in support of the declaration of the World Peace Congress and the Standing Committee. This movement has made people with greatly differing opinions aware of the terrible danger threatening the world, and has made them aware of the possibility of avoiding this danger. The Stockholm Declaration gives all people, regardless of their language, social status, or religious and political beliefs, a way to actively help save peace. Millions upon millions of individual signatures are becoming a force capable of stopping war.

　　The Executive Bureau resolution then pointed out: The Executive Bureau welcomes representatives of different faiths and factions who have taken a stand against atomic weapons. It welcomes all initiatives by political leaders, trade unionists, scientists, and other intellectuals that help people actively engage in the anti-war struggle. The Executive Bureau supports the International Red Cross's call to declare the atomic bomb illegal.

　　The Executive Bureau resolution calls on all peace supporters to conduct friendly competition to further promote the peace signature campaign. Before the closing of the Second World Peace Congress, every man and woman in every country in the world must be asked to state his or her attitude toward the banning of atomic weapons.

　　The Executive Bureau resolution announced: The Executive Bureau has decided to convene the Second World Peace Congress in Genoa, Italy, in late October this year. In accordance with the Standing Committee's previous decision, the basis for participating in the next congress will be acceptance of the Stockholm Declaration.

　　The Executive Bureau resolution also announced: The Executive Bureau has decided to invite celebrities from all walks of life to form a judging committee to award peace prizes in late August. The Executive Bureau also decided to launch a fundraising and sponsorship campaign around the world to establish an International Peace Fund.

　　In addition, the Executive Bureau meeting also passed two resolutions in support of Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee, protesting the French government's persecution by removing him from his position as High Commissioner for Atomic Energy; and in support of Mrs. Gordon, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee and Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, protesting the French government's unreasonable summons against her.

    进一步推广保卫世界和平签名运动
    禁止原子武器运动巨大发展
    一亿以上人民已签名
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局于五月三十一日至六月一日在伦敦举行全体会议。贝尔纳教授、戈登夫人、罗伯逊和达波赛诸人相继担任各次会议的主席。出席者除执行局的委员及常设委员会各书记外，尚有苏、英、美、芬、丹、瑞典诸国和平委员会的代表及各国杰出的民主斗士。
    执行局讨论了全世界为世界拥护和平大会常设委员会宣言征集签名运动的发展。执行局满意地指出这一运动已获得相当大的成绩，并决定采取新的措施以进一步推广这一运动。
    为此，执行局特通过如下的重要决议。
    执行局的决议首先指出：执行局欣慰地记录了下一事实，即禁用原子弹的运动，自从展开以来，已有巨大的发展，迄今收到的拥护世界和大常委会宣言的签名，已达一万万个以上。这个运动已使有极大意见分歧的人们认识到威胁着世界的可怕危险，并使他们觉悟到避免这种危险的可能性是存在的。斯德哥尔摩宣言给予所有的人们，不分其语言、社会地位及宗教、政治信仰，以积极帮助挽救和平的方法。千千万万的个人签名已在成为能够阻止战争的力量。
    执行局决议继而指出：执行局欢迎采取了反对原子武器之立场的、不同信仰与派别的代表们。它欢迎政治领袖们、工会运动者们、科学家们及其他知识分子所作的有助于使人民能够积极进行反战斗争的一切倡议。执行局支持国际红十字协会呼吁宣布原子弹为非法的宣言。
    执行局决议号召所有和平拥护者进行友好的竞赛，以更进一步推广和平签名运动。在第二次世界拥护和平大会闭幕之前，必须要求世界各国每一个男女表明他或她对禁用原子弹问题的态度。
    执行局决议宣布：执行局决定于本年十月下旬在意大利热那亚召集第二次世界拥护和平大会。按照常设委员会前此的决定，允许参加下次大会的基础，将是接受斯德哥尔摩宣言。
    执行局决议又宣布：执行局已决定邀请各界名流组成评判委员会，以便在八月下旬颁发和平奖金。执行局并决定在全世界发动设立国际和平基金的募捐与赞助运动。
    此外，执行局会议还通过了两项决议，声援世界和大常委会主席约里奥——居里，抗议法国政府解除其原子能高级专员一职的迫害行为；声援世界和大常委会副主席、国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人，抗议法国政府对她的无理传讯。
