　　The entire policy of the imperialist camp, headed by the United States, is aimed at preparing for a third world war. The purpose pursued by the Atlantic Pact is to gather all the human and material resources of the countries participating in the pact under the wings of the American imperialists, so that they can be used for the war they are preparing against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The signatory countries of this pact—such as France—have lost all opportunities to pursue the policies of an independent country. They are merely pawns for the United States in pursuing its aggressive aims.

　　In this anti-Soviet alliance, a position is also prepared for a revanchist West Germany, which has been exempted from reparations and is filled with American capital. Mr. Adenauer has proposed completely merging France and West Germany into one country. General de Gaulle expressed his heartfelt agreement. German Communist Party Chairman, our comrade Lehmann, said it well: this is an alliance of arms dealers.

　　At the same time, governments subordinate to American imperialists are launching an offensive against the political rights and freedoms of the working people. Accompanying the policy of war preparation is an attempt to suppress the working class and democratic movements. Police persecution, anti-union laws, and dirty laws are paving the way for the fascistization and militarization of the countries in the imperialist bloc.

　　American imperialists are supporting fascist regimes everywhere and ordering the adoption of police measures and anti-democratic measures in France and elsewhere, creating conditions for fascism.

　　Therefore, it is necessary for us to recall the correctness of the actions taken at the Communist Information Bureau meeting held in the second half of June 1948, when it resolutely exposed the treacherous policies of Tito and his gang of murderers and spies—mercenaries of imperialism. Tito and his group rapidly shifted from a bias of bourgeois nationalism and abandoning proletarian internationalism to the position of the most vile and malicious anti-Soviet policies. Tito and his group quickly exposed themselves as open lackeys of the warmongers. They showed that they were actually the latest type of Trotskyism—a counter-revolutionary commando.

　　Tito and his police gang snatched Yugoslavia from the camp of peace and socialism and sold it to American capitalism. This group of adventurers, dependent on wealthy peasants and old privileged classes, is restoring capitalism. Yugoslavia has been turned into a country of fascist dictatorship and a police state, a huge prison where the best sons of the people who continue to be loyal to their country and the ideals of communism and internationalism are being murdered.

　　American imperialists have assigned Tito a special task. Tito was ordered to organize, along with those traitors like him, conspiracies against the new system in the people's democratic countries, to overthrow the regimes of the working class and progressive democrats, to rebuild fascist dictatorships, so as to snatch these countries from the camp of democracy and peace and turn them into bases for aggression against the Soviet Union. The trials of spies (the interrogations of Rajk in Budapest and Brankov, and the interrogation of the traitor Kostov in Sofia) exposed the criminal activities of Tito and his group.

　　American masters also gave Tito another task: to try to spread confusion in the ranks of the international working-class movement and in the huge world movement for peace. On this point, the warmongers' failure is also very evident. Under the inspiration of the Cominform resolutions, the Communist Parties of all countries unanimously denounced Tito and his gang.

　　Achievements of the Camp of Peace, Democracy, and Socialism

　　Counterpoised to the imperialist and anti-democratic camp is the democratic and anti-imperialist camp—the camp of socialism and peace. The former is full of contradictions and is sinking deeper into economic crisis, which is resulting in an increasingly fierce continuation of its war preparation policies. The latter is steadily growing and strengthening.

　　On the basis of the significant development of the national economy, the material and cultural standards of the Soviet people are steadily rising. Workers' wages are increasing, and the income of collective farmers is growing. The recent price reductions have been greeted with joyful welcome by the Soviet people. The working people and democrats of the world also hail it as a new victory for the peace camp. How different this is from what is happening in France and other capitalist countries! (In these countries, the situation of workers and all ordinary people is becoming more and more difficult.)

　　A huge economic upsurge is also taking place in the people's democratic countries that enjoy the Soviet Union's fraternal and truly selfless assistance. In all these countries, the living standards of the masses have greatly improved.

　　How different this is from Yugoslavia, which has been turned into a slave of Anglo-American imperialists by Tito and his group! The entire economy of Yugoslavia has been ruined by the Titoites. Mines and factories are once again falling under the control of American monopoly capital, which is seizing the products of strategic materials. Despite dollar loans, national finances are completely collapsing. Wealthy peasants control the countryside. Workers receive hardly any supplies because state-owned stores are empty, while speculators control the free market. Prices are rising, and real wages are decreasing. The living conditions of the working people are deteriorating daily.

　　The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is a major victory for the democratic, anti-imperialist camp. In democratic Germany, the reactionary forces of pan-Germanism and the economic and political foundations of fascism have been swept away. Political power is in the hands of the working class and democrats. The government in Berlin announced that it understood the demands made by our people because they were alarmed about our security. This government announced that the German people must, as far as possible, compensate for the crimes committed against France and all of Europe by Hitler and his Nazis.

　　In this way, a true reconciliation with the German people has finally become possible, a reconciliation based on respect for France's right to security and compensation; it is based on mutual respect for the independence and integrity of the two countries.

　　The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and its outstanding leader Comrade Mao Zedong, have forever eliminated the feudal shackles of thousands of years and the colonial exploitation they have endured for nearly a hundred years. For the American imperialists who dreamed of turning China into their colony and an anti-Soviet springboard, the victory of the Chinese revolution was a heavy blow.

　　The fraternal alliance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and the fact that China has joined the democratic family of nations have greatly expanded the democratic camp and changed the balance of power in favor of democracy and socialism.

　　Aggressors are plotting to endanger peace and the independence of all nations. However, despite this, everything proves the consolidation of anti-imperialist forces. Never in history has there been such international solidarity, never has there been such an organized worldwide peace front. The democratic anti-imperialist camp is not an alliance limited to certain geographical boundaries. Indeed, it relies on powerful countries whose governments enjoy the trust and support of the people. But it has supporters in all countries of the imperialist camp, supported by all the working people of capitalist countries and all the oppressed people of colonial countries.

　　Undoubtedly, the fervent appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress to ban atomic weapons will win a huge response. In the coming weeks, millions upon millions of people will sign this statement to show their support for this call. We will also make all necessary efforts.

　　France is on the Edge of an Abyss

　　After the Communists were ousted from the government, the American masters plunged France into the snare of the "Marshall Plan."

　　What were the results? Several sectors of the national economy are in a state of decline. Some industrial sectors (such as the aircraft industry) have been completely shut down. Lead production is declining. The output of the leather industry is below the pre-war level. The number of unemployed is increasing day by day. Currently, there are 500,000 unemployed workers and part-time workers. Because coal is piling up in the mines, miners sometimes have nothing to do all day.

　　Agriculture is also threatened. The "Marshall Plan" has made the situation difficult for beet, tobacco, and grape growers. French growers have been ordered to reduce the area planted with beets by about 20 percent to allow American capitalists to sell their sugar.

　　Finally, there is the huge military burden of the franc that our people have to bear. It makes any financial recovery impossible. Despite new taxes amounting to hundreds of billions of francs, despite forced public bonds and special taxes, the budget deficit remains the same.

　　After the Communists were ousted from the government, the four consecutive devaluations have caused the franc to lose two-thirds of its value. From April 1947 to March 1950, the currency in circulation increased from 800 billion to more than 1,300 billion. The cost of living has risen sharply. The official Paris retail price index increased from 837 in April 1947 to 1922 in February 1950.

　　Wage increases have lagged far behind the rising cost of living. Since 1938, the living standards of the working people have declined by more than half. The proportion of wage earners' income in the national income fell from 45 percent in 1938 to 34 percent in the second half of 1949, while the proportion of capitalists' income increased from 29 percent to 50.5 percent.

　　The working class is sentenced to endure long-term malnutrition. In Paris and other large cities, the average daily consumption of meat per person decreased from 215 grams in 1865 to 112 grams in 1948. The government, which obeys the employers, opposes the workers' demands for wage adjustments and an immediate monthly increase of 3,000 francs. The government has rejected this demand from its own workers—those employed in state-owned enterprises. It has also sent police to be used by employers against strikers.

　　The unjust war against the Vietnamese people has been fought for three and a half years. This predatory war violated the March 8, 1946 agreement. The agreement recognized that the Vietnamese people should enjoy the rights of autonomy, the right to maintain national armies, police, and their own finances. The colonialists are not willing to lose their ugly privileges. They do not allow France and Vietnam to establish relations on a new basis, first of all on the basis of national self-determination. They used provocations to start a war and re-enslave the Vietnamese people. But despite their efforts, despite their indescribable atrocities, despite their performance of an evil comedy of concluding an agreement with Bao Dai—the nightclub emperor—they have not achieved their goal.

　　The entire Vietnamese people are united around their government, united around President Ho Chi Minh. The Vietnamese government controls 90 percent of the country's territory. It has been recognized by the two largest countries in the world—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

　　The negotiations conducted by Mr. Jessup, Mr. Truman's personal representative, illustrate a new aspect of the colonial war against Vietnam. Currently, the issue is to establish an American springboard on the border of the new China. The war in Vietnam is an integral part of the imperialists' preparation for World War III. Therefore, striving for immediate peace with Vietnam, actively supporting the right of self-determination of the Vietnamese people (including separation from France), and safeguarding the right of complete independence of the Vietnamese people is opposing the provocation of World War III.

　　The French government is systematically infringing on the basic rights of the working people: the right to organize trade unions, the right to strike, the right to assembly and demonstration.

　　The rights of Communist parliamentarians have been brutally violated. Pidault is trying to force through a vile and shameless bill, attempting to curb the growing movement of popular protest against the Vietnam War and anti-Soviet war preparations, a movement that will continue to grow.

　　Through persecution and slanderous propaganda, through despicable laws—which will make it possible to destroy the working class and democratic organizations—they are paving the way for General de Gaulle to come to power. We reveal, based on reliable information, the conspiracy of the de Gaullists against the working class and the Republic. The enemy's plot has been exposed. But we must be vigilant, we must expose and rise up against the planning of reactionary conspiracies, and act against the demonstrations and "exercises" conspiracies of the rebellious groups. We must ensure that the working class and all Republicans are fully prepared to form a united front to give any attempt to launch a fascist offensive a swift and crushing blow.

　　This government, which persecutes workers' activists and peace advocates, this government, which encourages preparations for fascist rebellion, also wants to prevent the country from knowing the truth about scandals involving bribe-takers and other corrupt generals and politicians.

　　The people already know the root causes of the despicable Vietnam War. They have learned with indignation that the Minister of National Defense—the right-wing Socialist Ramadier, the Minister of the Interior—the right-wing Socialist Moch, and the then Prime Minister—the Radical Party's Queuille, attempted to settle the bribery case secretly. Their excuse was: the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, who was exposed by a friend—a swindler and former Gestapo agent—was conducting negotiations on the Atlantic Pact, which was about to be signed at that time. The government did not want the people to understand the aggressive nature of the Atlantic Pact based on these shameful revelations.

　　The bribery case truly struck the entire regime—a regime of war, police brutality, filth, and blood.

　　In the ideological field, pressure on French thought and French science is increasing. Education funding in the budget has been reduced, and laboratories lack equipment. Tens of thousands of children are unable to attend school, while, on the other hand, the budget for death and war consumes 600 billion francs.

　　As the enemy's ideological pressure increases, our resistance also greatly strengthens. We call on our writers, painters, and actors to engage in struggle on the basis of the working class's ideological and political stance. In contrast to the decadent works of those bourgeois aesthetes—believers in art for art's sake, the eternal pessimism and obscurantism of the existentialist "philosophers," and the formalism of those painters who believe that art only begins when painting has no content, we offer a socialist realistic art that the working class can understand, an art that will help the working class in its struggle for liberation.

　　Struggle for Peace

　　Regardless of the government's arbitrary rule and oppression, the struggle for peace is growing and expanding domestically, and taking on various forms. The most important factor is that the working class is playing an increasingly important role in the peace movement.

　　Dockworkers in Algiers, Tunis, and other French ports, and French sailors, refuse to carry weapons used to fight their Vietnamese brothers. They refuse to unload American war materials used to invade their Soviet brothers. Railway workers refuse to work on trains loaded with war materials. This has happened at the Paris-Bercy railway station in Paris, and in Lyon, Nantes, Brest, and other places. The actions of railway workers are supported by mass demonstrations everywhere. In Grenoble, Saint-Pierre-des-Corps (near Tours), and Valence, people block trains carrying war materials. In Roanne, despite the presence of a large police force and their habitual atrocities, two thousand peace advocates demonstrated against the departure of a military train. The police arrested twenty-one demonstrators. They want to try the arrested persons according to the recently passed dirty law. Our next task is to turn the desire for peace into an effective struggle for peace everywhere.

　　To do this, we must first repeatedly explain to everyone who has been deceived by the enemy's lies and slanders the deep and fundamental causes of the danger of war, and explain that these causes are rooted in the capitalist system.

　　The French people's declaration against the anti-Soviet war caused an uproar in the newspapers of the imperialist running dogs and lackeys because these statements uncovered the aggressors' attempts to cover up their war preparations. As Frenchmen, as proletarians, we support Franco-Soviet friendship, we oppose preparations for anti-Soviet aggression. As Frenchmen, as patriots, we remember what de Gaulle once said, "The liberation of French territory was made possible primarily due to the efforts of the Russian people and their excellent army."

　　As proletarians, we defend Franco-Soviet friendship because the international working-class movement should be grateful for the October Socialist Revolution.

　　Some people say that war is inevitable. We must resolutely oppose this untrue and harmful theory. No, war is not inevitable! War is always possible under a capitalist regime, but this should never mean that the people of all countries should therefore resign themselves to fate and be content with the inevitability of war. Today, the peace forces that are organized and taking action around the world are large enough and strong enough to force war to retreat.

　　Another important aspect of the struggle for peace is to expose and tirelessly and systematically refute the lies spread by our enemies. They are actively preparing for war while talking about "peace." Their style is exactly the same as Hitler's back then. They shout "Europe," but their purpose is only to exclude two-thirds of Europe from the concept of "Europe." "European Parliament," "World Government"—these are all false, all used to cover up the Anglo-American imperialists' enslavement of the people of Western European countries, and to cover up preparations for an anti-Soviet war.

　　The movement for peace and freedom has become stronger. We must resolutely carry out the resolutions of the recent National Congress of Peace and Freedom Fighters, so as to constantly expand this movement and its scope of activities, and to hold elections for district peace councils and peace committees everywhere.

　　Unity is the condition for the success of peace forces, and that is unity of action. All strata—workers, peasants, the middle class; all workers' and democratic organizations, trade unions and cooperative organizations, sports clubs, veterans' associations, family members' associations, cultural, educational, and religious groups; all social figures, scientists, writers, journalists, parliamentarians, all peace advocates must fulfill their responsibilities in the peace movement.

　　We believe that it is good to reiterate the following: we Communists, on the one hand, reserve the victory of expressing our views in all circumstances, and on the other hand, fully recognize the right of all other true peace advocates to maintain their own views on various issues, including such important issues as the deep causes of the new war danger and the methods necessary to defend peace.

　　The struggles of the past three years have deepened the class consciousness of the working people. We must not ignore the damage caused by the trade union splitters at the end of 1947, but we can say that the so-called "Workers' Force" has failed to achieve the goals set by its American employers. Only a few months after the split, the members of the unions and organizations under the General Confederation of Labor, the Christian trade unions, and the "Workers' Force" reached unity of action in the struggle to increase wages—despite the resistance of the leaders of the splitter unions.

　　On November 25, 1949, under the slogan of unity, a massive 24-hour strike was held nationwide to support the demand for a 3,000-franc monthly wage increase and to oppose forced arbitration. The struggle for a 3,000-franc wage increase unfolded. By the end of February, workers in all sectors were involved in this struggle. In the struggle for unity, we must pay special attention to working among Socialist Party workers.

　　On many issues, Socialist Party workers and their comrades—Communist Party workers—share the same views. We must explain to them in a brotherly and convincing manner, and never use inappropriate shouts or aggressive expressions.

　　However, this does not mean that we must abandon our determination to resolutely expose the treacherous policies of the right-wing Socialist Party leaders, the defenders of bourgeois interests and the agents of foreign imperialists, the most enthusiastic advocates of the "Marshall Plan" and the Atlantic Pact, the initiators of the despicable war in Vietnam, such as Modet, and strike-breakers such as Moch.

　　The right-wing Socialist Party leaders recently expressed their support for the majority voting system. This system will favor the anti-communist alliance in future elections, and according to the right-wing Socialists, will completely drive us out of the National Assembly. They voted in favor of the despicable and dirty bill. From this voting situation, the real reason for the resignation of the Socialist Party ministers is very clear. The right-wing Socialist Party leaders were forced to play tricks under the pressure of growing mass dissatisfaction. They calculated in their hearts that by abandoning this gamble, they could restore their innocence. The demands of their American masters and the stubborn logic of the class struggle have forced them to expose their true colors earlier than they had hoped.

　　The "Marshall Plan" and the preparations for an imperialist war are accelerating the process of bankruptcy and proletarianization of the middle class. Shop owners are crushed by taxes; handicraftsmen and small manufacturers are driven out of the market by American competition. The number of bankruptcy cases is increasing. We must prevent these people from being deceived by the fascist arbitrary propaganda, and we will support their legitimate demands. Everyone can and must be drawn into the struggle for peace and national independence.

　　Farmers are experiencing countless difficulties. In addition, they hate war. They must also be drawn into the struggle for peace on a wider scale. The program of struggle to realize the demands of working farmers must be fully formulated, and the land issue must be raised completely. The land must belong to the tillers. We must clearly show the peasants that two paths are in front of them: one is the capitalist path that the big bourgeoisie is dragging them on—the path of exploitation, inevitable plunder, poverty, and war; and the other is the path that we call on the peasants and the working class to follow together. This is the path of socialism—then the land will finally belong to the tillers, then the land will return to its original owner.

　　Many anti-war actions are initiated by women, by their powerful organization—the French Women's Union. In the struggle against war, the prestige of various youth organizations has increased, and their influence has also expanded. French youth do not want to be cannon fodder for American imperialists.

　　Our party calls for unity to fight for a democratic and nationally united French government, a morally pure government that safeguards peace. Our party calls for unity to fight for the implementation of the following program. The main points of this program are as follows:

　　1. Expose the truth about the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Pact. France actively participates in all measures aimed at seeking a democratic, just, and lasting peace based on compliance with the United Nations Charter. Ratify the Franco-Soviet alliance—the guarantee of France's peace and security.

　　2. Unconditionally ban atomic weapons. Regard the government that first uses atomic bombs as a war criminal. Conclude a peace treaty between France, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and the People's Republic of China.

　　3. Implement the Potsdam Agreement on eradicating German Nazis and militarism. Recognize the German Democratic Republic, which abides by these agreements.

　　4. Immediately stop the war in Vietnam and send back the expeditionary corps. Support the struggle of the people in the colonies for freedom and independence.

　　5. Increase wages and implement a wage adjustment system with the cost of living. Immediately increase the monthly wage by 3,000 francs for all wage earners. Implement laws on collective contracts and guaranteed minimum wages. Satisfy the legitimate demands of veterans and war victims, as well as former prisoners of war, the unemployed, prisoners, disabled workers, and elderly workers. Protect our industry from the infringement and threat of American imperialists.

　　6. Revive French agriculture and protect our main agricultural products from the harm of overseas exporters based on a policy that guarantees stable agricultural product prices and recoverable expenses.

　　7. Restore normal trade relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

　　8. Greatly reduce military expenditures and allocate a large part of this fund to the construction of the national economy and the construction of housing.

　　9. Consolidate the fruits of democracy, especially social insurance.

　　10. Defend the laws and constitutional freedoms of the Republic (the right to strike, freedom of speech, assembly, association, and demonstration). Abolish dirty bills. Disarm the militarized organizations organized by the French People's League to launch a civil war and disband them.

　　11. Release the resistance fighters, strikers, and peace advocates who have been illegally imprisoned, persecuted, or convicted.

　　These are the main points of the program that we submit to the approval of the masses of the people. The masses of the people can and will guarantee the implementation of this program with their struggle.

　　Party

　　Thirty years of unremitting struggle for peace have prepared the conditions for the French Communist Party to engage in this great battle that is determining the fate of France and all mankind.

　　In the last parliamentary elections in 1946, the French people gave us nearly 30 percent of the total votes, making the Communist Party the largest party in our country. The municipal elections in 1947, the county elections in 1949, and the recent by-elections have confirmed that the Communist Party's influence among all parts of the working people in urban and rural areas is increasing day by day.

　　The masses place their hopes on us. Relying on the trust of the masses, our party is victoriously fighting back against the fierce attacks of all kinds of enemies in collusion. The enemies of the people hope to weaken our influence and use all weapons against us—lies, slander, intimidation, instigation, and suppression. Their calculations are wrong. The failure of their anti-communist movement is very obvious. Their plan to reform the electoral system is an admission of this failure.

　　Unable to reduce the number of votes cast for us, the enemies of the people want to invalidate these votes. We may assume that electoral arithmetic can allow them to create this kind of deception, but this will not change social and political reality. This reality is the struggle of the French people against reaction, poverty, and war, and for peace and national independence.

　　We are aware of all the inspiring power of this reality, but this reality also gives us a great responsibility. We are aware of our responsibilities to the working class, to all the people, and to France. This is why we never feel satisfied with ourselves and constantly and unceasingly critically examine our own activities.

　　We must especially urge the entire party to pay attention to the shortcomings and errors that weaken the party's work, and thus also weaken the struggle for peace and national independence.

　　The most serious of these shortcomings is underestimating the danger of war, and at the same time underestimating the strength of the working class and the strength of the peace camp, which have all the necessary conditions to thwart the plans of the warmongers.

　　Sometimes, we meet some party members. They are not brave enough to announce our friendship and trust in the Soviet Union; they have not seen the most important role played by the Soviet Union in the struggle for peace.

　　But those who are skeptical and wavering about the attitude toward the Soviet Union have actually degenerated to the nationalist position and abandoned the principles of proletarian internationalism.

　　Abandoning proletarian internationalism, turning to nationalism, expressing any suspicion of the Soviet Union, regarding the Soviet Union as "just another country," ignoring the difference between socialist countries and imperialist countries—all these will inevitably result in betraying the cause of the working class and the cause of socialism. This is the end of Tito and his group of adventurers. They went to the side of the warmongers and became the mortal enemies of their people, the international working-class movement, and the Soviet Union.

　　Another extremely serious shortcoming that greatly damages the party's work—especially the party's activities to unite the entire working class and all peace fighters against the danger of war—is sectarianism, which the Central Committee is relentlessly fighting against.

　　Sectarians, like opportunists, do not believe in the masses and despise the masses. They stand high above the broad united front for peace. They do not participate in trade unions, nor do they engage in any trade union work. They refuse to work in mass organizations such as cooperatives, veterans, former prisoners of war associations, women's committees, former resistance movement fighters associations, tenants' associations, war victims' associations, youth groups, young women's organizations, sports clubs, or cultural associations.

　　Our party is strengthening its own strength, despite the enemies' attempts to attack it from within. We see how the imperialists use the Tito agency and the Trotskyite small groups.

　　Communists must show firm revolutionary vigilance in order to expose all hostile elements—police, secret agents, spies, and informers sent by the bourgeoisie into the party, and drive them out of their ranks.

　　Strictly adhering to the principles of democratic centralism, supervising from bottom to top, and appraising every party member in the work will help to quickly eliminate the unstable elements who try to infiltrate the party.

　　The party's work in the factories is not a formal and secondary matter that can be solved by administrative methods. This question is an extremely important question arising from the essence of our party—the new type of Leninist party. If the party does not get reliable support in the factories, if the party does not absorb the most conscious and most active workers into the party organizations in the factories, it will not be able to complete its urgent and important tasks, and most importantly, it will not be able to carry out the struggle for peace and national independence.

　　In order to implement the Stockholm resolutions, we will immediately work with all peace advocates to do everything possible to seek worldwide condemnation of atomic weapons, weapons that invade and exterminate the people of all countries.

　　We are fighting for peace, that is, for socialism, for communism, for the most beautiful and just cause.

　　Communism is now on the agenda. All attacks, searches, and slanders against the Communist Party can only strengthen it and increase its greatness.

　　Only seventy years separate the appearance of the "Communist Manifesto" from the October Socialist Revolution; on the centennial anniversary of this immortal work by Marx and Engels, eight hundred million people from the Elbe River to the Pacific Ocean have broken the chains of imperialism and begun to build a new society. In countries that are still in the shackles of capitalism, tens of millions of people also believe in the ideas of Marx, Engels, and Lenin.

　　The fate of capitalist society has been doomed. It must and will give way to socialism, to communism. With firm determination and fervent confidence, throw ourselves into the struggle for peace, for national independence, for France!

　　Long live free, democratic, and independent France!

　　Long live communism!

　　Long live peace!

　　为法国的民族独立与和平而斗争
    一九五零年四月在法国共产党第十二次代表大会上的报告
    法国共产党总书记  多列士
    以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的全部政策，其目的乃在于准备第三次世界大战。大西洋公约所追逐的目的乃是把美帝国主义者卵翼下的参加公约的国家的全部人力物力汇合起来，以便用于他们正在准备的反对苏联和人民民主国家的战争。这个公约的诸签字国——例如法国——已失去了执行一个独立国政策的一切机会。它们不过是美国追逐其侵略目的的走卒罢了。
    在这个反苏联盟中间，也给免除了赔偿义务与充斥着美国资本的复仇主义的西德准备了一个位置。阿登纳先生已建议把法国与西德完全合并为一个国家。戴高乐将军表示衷心赞同。德国共产党主席，我们的雷曼同志说得很对：这是一个大炮商人的同盟。
    同时，隶属于美帝国主义者的各国政府正对劳动人民的政治权利和自由采取攻势。伴随战争准备政策而来的乃是镇压工人阶级和民主运动的企图。警察的迫害，反工会法律和肮脏的法律正在为帝国主义集团各国的法西斯化和军国主义化廓清道路。
    美帝国主义者正到处在支撑法西斯政权，并下令在法国和其他地方采取警察措施和反民主措施，为法西斯主义创设条件。
    因此，我们有必要回忆一下在一九四八年六月下半月举行的共产党情报局会议所采取的行动的正确性，当时它坚决地揭露了铁托及其杀人犯和间谍匪帮——帝国主义的雇佣兵——的叛卖政策。铁托及其集团从资产阶级民族主义的偏向和放弃无产阶级国际主义的行为迅速地转到了最下贱的和最恶毒的反苏政策的立场。铁托及其集团很快地暴露了他们自己是战争贩子的公开走狗。他们表明了他们实际上是最新的一种托洛茨基主义——反革命的突击队。
    铁托及其警察伙帮把南斯拉夫从和平与社会主义阵营中夺去，并把它卖给美国资本主义。这个依赖富农和旧日特权阶层的冒险家集团正在恢复资本主义。南斯拉夫已经被变成一个法西斯独裁统治的国家和警察国家，已经被变成了一个巨大的监狱，一切继续效忠祖国以及共产主义和国际主义理想的人民的最优秀的儿子都在那里遭到杀害。
    美帝国主义者授予铁托一个特别的任务。铁托被命令和那些与他类似的卖国贼们一起来组织反对人民民主国家的新制度的阴谋，来推翻工人阶级的、进步的民主主义的政权，来重建法西斯独裁统治，以便把这些国家从民主与和平阵营中夺去并把它们变成侵略苏联的基地。间谍们的审判（布达佩斯的拉伊克和布兰科夫的审讯以及索非亚的卖国贼科斯托夫的审讯）揭露了铁托及其集团的罪恶活动。
    美国主子们还给予铁托另一个任务：设法在国际工人阶级运动的队伍中以及拥护和平的巨大的世界运动中散布混乱。在这一点上，战争贩子的失败也是很显明的。各国共产党在情报局的决议的启示下一致地痛斥铁托及其匪帮。
    和平、民主与社会主义阵营的成就
    与帝国主义和反民主阵营对垒的是民主和反帝国主义阵营——社会主义和和平阵营。前者充满了矛盾，并且正在更深地陷入经济危机之中，其结果就是越来越凶地继续其战争准备政策。后者则正在稳步地壮大和加强。
    在国民经济的显著发展的基础之上，苏联人民的物质和文化水准正在稳步地上升着。工人的工资在增加，集体农民的收入在增长。最近的物价减低博得了苏联人民的兴高采烈的欢迎。全世界劳动人民和民主主义者也欢呼它是和平阵营的新的胜利。这和法国及其他资本主义国家所发生的事情是如何地不同啊！（在这些国家里，工人和一切普通人民的境况正在变得越来越困难）
    享有苏联的兄弟般的和真正无私的援助的人民民主国家中，也正在发生一个巨大的经济高涨。在所有这些国家中，群众的生活水准都已大大提高了。
    这和被铁托及其集团变成英美帝国主义者的奴隶的南斯拉夫是如何地不同啊！南斯拉夫的整个经济已经被铁托分子毁坏了。矿山和工厂正再次沦入美国垄断资本的控制之下，美国垄断资本正在攫取战略原料的出产品。尽管有美元贷款，国家财政仍全部瓦解。富农控制着乡村。工人们几乎得不到任何供应品，因为国营商店是空的，而投机商人则控制着自由市场。物价正在上涨，实际工资则正在减少。劳动人民的生活状况在日益恶化。
    德意志民主共和国的成立是民主、反帝国主义阵营的一大胜利。在民主的德国，大日耳曼主义的反动势力和法西斯主义的经济与政治基础已被扫除。政权掌握在工人阶级和民主主义者的手中。柏林的政府宣布，它体会我国人民由于对我国安全感到惊慌而提出的要求。这个政府宣布，德国人民必须尽可能地赔偿希特勒及其纳粹分子对法国和全欧洲所作的罪行。
    这样，和德国人民真正和解已终于成为可能了，这个和解是以尊重法国享有安全与赔偿的权利为基础的；它是以两国互相尊重独立与完整为基础的。
    中国人民，在共产党及其杰出的领袖毛泽东同志的领导之下，已永远地消灭了几千年来的封建桎梏和近一百年来所经受的殖民地剥削。对于梦想变中国为其殖民地及反苏跳板的美帝国主义者来说，中国革命的胜利乃是一个沉重的打击。
    苏联和中华人民共和国间的兄弟同盟以及中国参加民主国家大家庭的事实，大大地扩大了民主阵营，并使力量对比起了有利于民主与社会主义的变化。
    侵略者们正在阴谋危害和平与各国人民的独立。但是，尽管这样，一切事情都证明了反帝国主义力量的巩固。在历史上从来没有过这样的国际团结，从来没有过这样的有组织的全世界和平阵线。民主的反帝国主义阵营不是一个限于一定的地理边界以内的同盟。的确，它依靠着那些政府享有人民的信任和拥护的强大国家。但是，它在帝国主义阵营的一切国家中都拥有支持者，资本主义国家的一切劳动人民和一切殖民地国家的被压迫人民都支持它。
    无疑地，世界拥护和平大会常设委员会要求禁用原子武器的热情呼吁将博得巨大的响应，在未来数周中成百万成百万的人民将在这个文告上签字，以表示支持这个号召。我们也将作一切必要的努力。
    法国处在深渊的边缘
    在共产党人被摈出政府之后，美国主子们把法国投入了“马歇尔计划”的罗网。
    结果是什么呢？国民经济的若干部门处于一种衰降的状态之中。某些工业部门（例如飞机工业）已经完全停闭。铅的生产正在下降。皮革工业的出产在战前水准之下。失业者的数目与日俱增。目前，失业工人和部分时间工作工人共有五十万人。由于煤堆积在矿场，矿工们有时成天完全无事可做。
    农业也受到威胁。“马歇尔计划”使得甜菜、烟草和葡萄的种植者们处境困难。法国种植者们得到命令，要他们减少种植甜菜的面积约百分之二十，好让美国资本家们来销售他们的糖。
    最后，还有法郎庞大的军费负担要我国人民来担负。它使得任何财政上的复原都成为不可能。尽管有数达几千亿法郎之多的新税，尽管有强迫公债和特别捐税，预算赤字依然如故。
    在共产党人被摈出政府后，连续四次贬值的结果已使法郎价值丧失三分之二。从一九四七年四月到一九五零年三月，流通的纸币从八千亿增至一万三千亿以上。生活费用已大大上涨。官方的巴黎零售物价指数从一九四七年四月的八三七增至一九五○年二月的一九二二。
    工资的增加远远落后于生活费用的上涨。从一九三八年以来，劳动人民的生活水准已经下降了一半以上。工资阶层的收入在国民收入中所占的比重从一九三八年的百分之四十五降至一九四九年下半年的百分之三十四，而资本家收入的比重则从百分之二十九增至百分之五十点五。
    工人阶级被判定要忍受长期的营养不足。在巴黎和其他大城市中，每人平均每日消费的肉类数量从一八六五年的二百一十五克减至一九四八年的一百一十二克。唯雇主之命是从的政府，反对工人们提出的修改工资和立即每月增加三千法郎的要求。政府已经拒绝了它自己的工人——受雇于国营企业的工人们——的这项要求。它还派遣警察，供雇主们用来反对罢工者。
    对越南人民进行的非正义战争已经打了三年半。这个掠夺性的战争破坏了一九四六年三月八日的协定。该协定曾承认越南人民应享有自治的权利、保持国家军队、警察及自己的财政的权利。殖民者们还不甘心丧失他们的丑恶的特权。他们不许法国和越南在新的基础上，首先是在民族自决权的基础上建立关系。他们使用挑衅手段以便发动战争和再次奴役越南人民。但是，尽管他们努力，尽管他们从事无法形容的暴行，尽管他们扮演了一出和保大——夜总会皇帝——缔结协定的阴恶的喜剧，他们还是没有达到目的。
    整个越南人民团结在自己的政府的周围，团结在胡志明主席的周围。越南政府控制了该国领土的百分之九十。它已经得到了世界上两个最大的国家——苏联和中华人民共和国——的承认。
    杜鲁门私人代表耶塞普先生所进行的谈判，说明了反对越南的殖民战争的新的方面。目前，问题是要在新中国的边界上建立一块美国的跳板。越南的战争是帝国主义者的第三次世界大战的准备工作的一个组成部分。因此，争取立即与越南媾和，积极支持越南人民的自决权（包括脱离法国），维护越南人民完全独立的权利，就是反对挑起第三次世界大战。
    法国政府有步骤地侵犯劳动人民的基本权利：组织工会的权利、罢工的权利、集会和示威的权利。
    共产党议员的权利受到了残酷的侵犯。皮杜尔正图强行通过下流无耻的法案，妄图遏止正在增长并将继续增长的人民抗议越南战争和抗议反苏战争准备工作的运动。
    借着迫害和诽谤宣传，借着卑鄙的法律——它将使摧毁工人阶级的和民主的组织有了可能——他们正在给戴高乐将军的当权铺砌道路。我们根据可靠情报，揭露戴高乐分子对工人阶级与共和国的阴谋。敌人的图谋已经被揭穿了。但是我们必须警惕，我们必须揭露并奋起反对反动阴谋的策划，以行动来反对谋叛集团的示威和“演习”阴谋。我们必须让工人阶级和一切共和分子有充分准备，以便结成一条联合阵线，给予发动法西斯攻势的任何企图一个迅速的粉碎性的打击。
    这个迫害工人积极分子及和平拥护者的政府，这个鼓励法西斯谋叛的准备的政府，同时还想不让国家知道关于受贿者和其他腐败的将军们和政客们的丑闻的真象。
    人民已经知道了卑鄙的越南战争的根本原因。他们已经满怀愤慨地知道了国防部长——右翼社会党人拉马第，内政部长——右翼社会党人莫克以及当时的总理——激进党人葛义，企图使受贿案暗中了结。他们的借口是：被朋友——一个骗子和前盖斯塔波特务——揭发了的陆军总司令正在进行关于大西洋公约的谈判，而大西洋公约那时正是即将签订的时候。政府是不想让人民根据这些可耻的揭发来了解大西洋公约的侵略性质的。
    受贿案真正打击了整个政权——战争、警察暴行、污秽和鲜血的政权。
    在思想方面，对于法国思想和法国科学的压力正在加强。预算中的教育经费已经减少，实验室没有仪器。成千成万的儿童不得入学，另一方面，死亡和战争的预算却耗去六千亿法郎。
    敌人在思想方面的压力增加了，我们的抵抗也大大地加强了。我们号召我们的作家们、画家们和演员们在工人阶级的思想与政治立场的基础上从事斗争。和那些资产阶级的美学家们——为艺术而艺术的信徒们的颓废作品，存在主义的“哲学家们”的永恒的悲观主义和蒙昧主义以及那些认为只有当绘画没有内容时才开始有艺术的画家们的形式主义相反，我们提供一个工人阶级可以了解的、社会主义现实主义的艺术，一个将帮助工人阶级从事解放斗争的艺术。
    为和平而斗争
    不顾政府的专横统治与压迫，拥护和平的斗争在国内增长着和扩展着，并且采取了多种多样的形式。最重要的因素是工人阶级在和平运动中起着愈来愈大的作用。
    阿尔及尔、突尼斯与法国其它港口的码头工人及法国的海员们，拒绝载运用来与他们的越南兄弟作战的武器。他们拒绝起卸用来侵略他们的苏联兄弟的美国战争物资。铁路工人拒绝在装有战争物资的火车上工作。在巴黎——贝西铁路的巴黎站，在里昂、南特、布勒斯特等地，就有这样情形。铁路工人的行动到处受到群众示威的支持。在格累诺布尔、圣辟拉德科（都尔附近）及华伦斯，人们拦住载着战争物资的火车。在罗安，不顾大批警察队的在场与他们惯用的暴行，二千名和平拥护者举行示威，反对开出一列军车。警察逮捕了二十一名示威者。他们要根据最近通过的肮脏的法律来审讯被捕者。我们的下一任务就是在一切地方把对和平的渴望变为争取和平的有效斗争。
    要作到这一点，我们必须首先向一切受了敌人的谎言与诽谤的欺骗的人，反复地解释战争危险的深刻的基本的原因，并说明这些原因根源于资本主义制度。
    法国人民反对反苏战争的声明在帝国主义的走狗与奴才的报纸上引起一片叫嚣，因为这些声明揭开了侵略者企图用来掩盖他们的战争准备的假面具。作为法国人，作为无产者，我们拥护法苏友谊，我们反对反苏侵略的准备。作为法国人，作为爱国分子，我们记得戴高乐一度说过的话，“法国领土的解放之成为可能首先是由于俄国人民及他们的优秀军队的努力。”
    作为无产者，我们保卫法苏友谊，因为国际工人阶级运动应感谢十月社会主义革命。
    有些人说，战争是不可避免的。我们必须坚决反对这种不真实的有害的理论。不，战争不是不可避免的！在资本主义政权的条件下战争总是可能的，但绝不能因此就说，各国人民就应当因此听天由命，自安于战争的不可避免性。今天，在全世界组织起来和采取行动的和平力量是足够巨大，足够强大，足以迫使战争退却。
    争取和平的斗争的另一重要方面是暴露，不倦地和有步骤地驳斥我们的敌人所散布的谎言。他们一面在空谈“和平”，另一方面又在积极准备战争。他们的作风和希特勒当年一模一样。他们叫喊着“欧洲”，但其目的只是为了把三分之二的欧洲排出“欧洲”这一概念之外。“欧洲议会”，“世界政府”——这一切全都是假的，全都是用来掩饰英美帝国主义者奴役西欧各国人民的行为，掩饰反苏战争的准备的。
    争取和平与自由的运动已更加壮大。我们必须坚决地进行斗争，实现最近举行的和平与自由战士全国大会决议，以便时时扩大这一运动及其活动范围，并在一切地方举行区和平理事会与和平委员会的选举。
    团结一致是和平力量成功的条件，这就是行动的一致。一切阶层——工人、农民、中间阶级；一切工人与民主组织，工会与合作社组织，体育俱乐部，退伍军人联合会，家庭成员联合会，文化、教育与宗教社团；一切社会名流、科学家、作家、新闻记者、议员、一切拥护和平的人，都必须在和平运动中各尽职责。
    我们认为再一次宣布下面一件事情是有好处的：我们共产党人一方面保留在一切情况下表示我们的观点的胜利，另一方面也充分承认一切其他真正和平拥护者对各种问题保持自己见解的权利，这些问题包括新战争危险的深刻原因及保卫和平所必需的方法这样重大的问题。
    过去三年来的斗争已经加深了劳动人民的阶级觉悟。我们毫不要忽视工会分裂分子在一九四七年年底所造成的损害，但我们可以说，所谓“工人力量”并未能达到它的美国雇主们规定的目的。在分裂之后不过几个月，总工会下属各工会与组织的、基督教工会及“工人力量”的会员们间就达到为提高工资而斗争的行动的统一——尽管有分裂分子工会的领袖们抵抗。
    一九四九年十一月二十五日，在团结的口号下，全国各地举行声势浩大的二十四小时罢工，支持每月增资三千法郎的要求和反对强迫仲裁。要求增资三千法郎的斗争展开了。到二月底，一切部门的工人全都卷入了这一斗争。在争取团结的斗争中，我们必须特别注意在社会党工人中的工作。
    在许多问题上，社会党工人和他们的同志——共产党工人的见解相合。我们必须兄弟般地令人信服地向他们解说，决不可使用不适当的叫喊，或咄咄逼人的表达方法。
    但是，这并不意味着我们必须放弃坚决地揭露右翼社会党领袖、资产阶级利益的保卫者与外国帝国主义者的代理人、“马歇尔计划”与大西洋公约的最热心的倡导者、越南的卑鄙战争的发起者如摩戴之流及罢工破坏者如莫克之流的叛卖政策的决心。
    右翼社会党领袖最近表示赞成多数表决制度。这一制度在未来的选举中将有利于反共的联盟，而且据右翼社会党人看，还会把我们完全赶出国民议会。他们投票赞成卑鄙龌龊的议案。从这种表决情形来看，社会党部长们辞职的真正理由就很清楚了。右翼社会党领袖在群众的日益不满的压力下被迫玩弄花样。他们心中盘算，放弃了这场赌博，他们就能恢复他们的清白。他们的美国主子的要求与阶级斗争的顽强的逻辑，已迫使他们比他们所希望的要早地暴露了原形。
    “马歇尔计划”与帝国主义战争的准备正在加速中间阶级的破产与无产阶级化的过程。商店老板被捐税压垮了；手工业者与小制造商被美国的竞争赶出市场。破产案件的数目正在增加。我们必须使这些人不为法西斯的武断宣传所欺骗，我们将支持他们的正当要求。可以而且必须吸引一切人参加争取和平与民族独立的斗争。
    农民们正在经受着数不清的困难。此外，他们还憎恨战争。他们也必须在更广泛的规模上被吸引来参加争取和平的斗争。争取实现劳动农民的要求的斗争纲领必须充分地订定，土地问题必须完整地提出。土地必须归于耕者。我们必须清楚地向农民表明，两条道路摆在他们面前：一条是大资产阶级正在拖他们走的资本主义的道路——剥削、不可避免的掠夺、贫困与战争的道路；一条是我们号召农民与工人阶级共同遵循的道路。这就是社会主义的道路——那时土地将最后地属于耕者，那时土地将会返回到原主手里。
    许多反对战争的行动是由妇女，是由她们的强大组织——法兰西妇女联盟发起。在反对战争的斗争中，各种青年组织的威望增加了，它们的影响也扩大了。法国青年不要为美帝国主义者当炮灰。
    我们党号召团结起来为一个民主与全国一致的法国政府、一个道德上纯洁的、维护和平的政府而斗争。我们党号召团结起来，为贯彻下面的纲领而斗争。这个纲领的要点如下：
    一、揭露马歇尔计划及大西洋公约的真象。法国积极参加一切旨在谋取以遵守联合国宪章为基础的民主的、正义的与持久的和平的措施。批准法苏同盟——法国的和平与安全的保证。
    二、无条件地禁用原子武器。视首先使用原子弹的政府为战犯。法国、苏联、美国、英国与中华人民共和国间缔结和平公约。
    三、执行关于肃清德国纳粹与军国主义的波茨坦协定。承认遵守这些协定的德意志民主共和国。
    四、立即停止在越南的战争并遣回远征兵团。支援各殖民地人民争取自由与独立的斗争。
    五、增加工资与实行工资随生活费调整制。立即为一切工资生活者每月增加三千法郎。实行关于集体合同与保证最低工资的法律。满足退伍军人与战争受害者，以及前战争俘虏、失业者、犯人、残废工人与年老工人的合法要求。保护我们的工业免受美帝国主义者的侵犯与威胁。
    六、根据一项保证农产品价格稳定与开销可以收回的政策，使法国的农业复苏，并保护我们的主要农产品免遭海外出口商的危害。
    七、与中东欧各国恢复正常贸易关系。
    八、大大减少军费，将这笔款项的一大部分拨作国民经济的建设及建筑住宅之用。
    九、巩固民主的果实，特别是社会保险。
    十、保卫共和国的法律和宪法自由（罢工的权利、言论、集会、结社与示威的自由）。废除肮脏的法案。解除法国人民联盟为了发动内战而组织的军事化的组织的武装，并将他们解散。
    十一、释放遭到非法监禁、迫害或被判罪的抵抗运动的战士、罢工者与和平拥护者。
    这就是我们提交人民群众批准的纲领的要点。人民群众可以而且将用他们的斗争保证这一纲领的贯彻。
    党
    三十年来的维护和平的从不停息的斗争，准备了法国共产党从事这一正在决定法国及全人类命运的伟大战斗的条件。
    在一九四六年的上届议会选举中，法国人民把总票数的近百分之三十给了我们，使共产党上升为我国第一大党。一九四七年的市选举，一九四九年的县选举及最近的补缺选举已经证实：共产党在城乡劳动人民的各个部分中的影响日增。
    群众把希望寄托在我们身上。我们党依靠着群众的信任，正在胜利地还击串通一气的各种敌人的猛力进攻。人民的敌人希望削弱我们的影响，利用一切武器反对我们——谎言、诽谤、恫吓、挑拨与压制。他们的算盘打错了。他们的反共运动的失败是很显明的。他们的改革选举制度的计划就是这一失败的承认。
    人民的敌人由于无力减少投给我们的选票的数目，就想把这些选票视为无效。我们姑认为选举算术可以使他们造出这种骗局，但这也不会改变社会的与政治的现实。这种现实就是法国人民反对反动、贫困与战争，争取和平与民族独立的斗争。
    我们意识到这一现实的一切鼓舞人的力量，但这种现实同时也赋予我们一个巨大的责任。我们意识到我们在工人阶级、在全体人民、在法国面前的职责。这就是我们为什么绝不对自己感到满意，时时刻刻不停止批判地看待我们自己的活动的原因。
    我们特别要促请全党注意削弱党的工作，因此也是削弱争取和平与民族独立的斗争的缺点和错误。
    这些缺点中最严重的是过低估计战争危险，同时也是过低估计拥有一切必要条件，足以挫败战争贩子的计划的工人阶级的力量及和平阵营的力量。
    有时，我们会遇见一些党员。他们不够勇敢，不敢宣布我们对苏联的友谊与信任；他们没有看见苏联在争取和平的斗争中所起的最重大的作用。
    但那些抱怀疑的，对苏联的态度动摇不定的人，实际上已堕落到民族主义的立场，放弃了无产阶级的国际主义的原则。
    抛弃无产阶级的国际主义，转向民族主义，对于苏联表示任何猜忌，视苏联为“不过是另一国家”，忽视社会主义国家与帝国主义国家之间的差别——这一切的结果不可避免地会是叛卖工人阶级的事业、社会主义的事业。这正是铁托及其冒险家集团的下场。他们走到战争贩子方面去，变成了他们人民的、国际工人阶级运动的和苏联的死敌。
    另一个大大损害党的工作——特别是党团结全体工人阶级与一切和平战士反对战争危险的活动——的极为严重的缺点，就是中央委员会正在毫不停息地与之斗争的宗派主义。
    宗派主义者像机会主义者一样，不相信群众，轻视群众。他们高高站在广泛的争取和平的统一战线之上。他们不参加工会，也不从事任何工会工作。他们拒绝在合作社、退伍军人、前战俘联合会、妇女委员会、前抵抗运动战士联合会、房客联合会、战争受害者联合会、青年团体、女青年组织，体育俱乐部或文化协会等群众团体中工作。
    我们党正在壮大自己的力量，尽管敌人企图从内部打击它。我们看见帝国主义分子如何利用铁托代理机关及托派小集团。
    共产党人必须表现坚定的革命警惕性，以便揭露一切敌对分子——资产阶级派到党内的警察、特务、间谍、密探，并把他们从自己的队伍中赶出去。
    严守民主集中制的原则，自下而上的监督在工作中鉴定每一个党员，将有助于迅速消除设法钻到党内的不稳分子。
    党在工厂中的工作不是一种可以用行政方法加以解决的形式的次要的事情。这一问题是一个由我们的党——新型的列宁主义的党——的本质中产生的极其重要的问题。党如果在工厂中得不到可靠的支持，党如果不把最觉悟的与最积极的工人吸收到工厂中的党组织中，就无法完成它的迫切而重要的任务，而且最重要地，就无法进行争取和平与民族独立的斗争。
    为了执行斯德哥尔摩的决议，我们将立即协同一切和平拥护者，尽一切力量求得举世谴责原子武器，侵略与灭绝各国人民的武器。
    我们为和平而斗争，也就是为社会主义，为共产主义，为最美妙的与正义的事业而斗争。
    共产主义现在已提到日程上。一切反对共产党的攻击、搜捕与诽谤，只能加强它，增加它的伟大性。
    《共产党宣言》的出现与十月社会主义革命仅仅相隔七十年；在马克思与恩格斯的这一不朽著作的百年纪念日，由易北河到太平洋，八亿人民已经打破帝国主义的锁链，开始建设一个新社会。在仍然处在资本主义枷锁下的国家中，千万人民也信仰着马恩列斯的思想。
    资本主义社会的命运已经注定。它必须而且将让位于社会主义，让位于共产主义。以坚定的决心和热忱的信心，投向为了和平、为了民族独立、为了法国的斗争！
    自由、民主与独立的法国万岁！
    共产主义万岁！
    和平万岁！
