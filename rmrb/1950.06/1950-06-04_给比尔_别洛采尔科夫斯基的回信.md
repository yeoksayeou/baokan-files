　　Reply to Comrade Bill-Belotserkovsky
    Stalin
    Editor's Note: This letter was written on February 2, 1929. It was first published in Volume 11 of "The Complete Works of Stalin," published by the Soviet National Political Books Publishing Bureau in 1949. This letter puts forward important principles on how to conduct struggles on the ideological front of literature and art, which is of great practical educational significance to us. Comrade Bill-Belotserkovsky:
    The letter is too late. But better late than never.

    (1) I think it is incorrect to raise the issue of "Rightists" and "Leftists" in literature and art (that is, in drama). The concepts of "Rightist" or "Leftist" are now party concepts in our country, strictly speaking, intra-party concepts. "Rightists" and "Leftists" are people who deviate from the true party line to one side or the other. Therefore, it is strange to apply these concepts to non-Party and extremely broad fields such as literature and art, drama, etc. These concepts can be applied to a certain literary group of the Party (Communist). There can be "Rightists" and "Leftists" in this group. But to apply these concepts to literature and art at the current stage of development, which has various factions, even anti-Soviet and simply counter-revolutionary factions, is to reverse all concepts. The most correct thing is to apply concepts belonging to the class category in the field of literature and art, and even use concepts such as "Soviet," "anti-Soviet," "revolutionary," "counter-revolutionary," and so on.

    (2) From this, it can be concluded that I cannot regard "Golovanovism" (Note) as a "Rightist" or "Leftist" danger—it is outside the scope of intra-party factions. "Golovanovism" belongs to the category of anti-Soviet phenomena. Of course, this does not lead to the conclusion that Golovanov himself cannot correct himself, that he cannot get rid of his mistakes; even when he is willing to say goodbye to his mistakes, we must investigate and punish him, and we must force him to go abroad.

    Or, for example, Bulgakov's "Flight" cannot be regarded as a manifestation of "Leftist" or "Rightist" dangers either. "Flight" expresses an attempt to evoke pity, if not sympathy, for certain anti-Soviet émigré classes—therefore, it is an attempt to defend or semi-defend the White Army's activities. "Flight" as it is now is an anti-Soviet phenomenon.

    However, I am not entirely opposed to staging "Flight" if Bulgakov adds one or two more dreams to his eight dreams, in which he describes the inherent social dynamics of the Soviet civil war, so that the audience can understand that all these particularly "loyal" Serafima and various university lecturers were driven out of Russia not because of the Bolsheviks' temporary pleasure, but because they (no matter how "loyal" they were) used to ride on the necks of the people, and the Bolsheviks drove out these "loyal" people who supported exploitation, which was to realize the will of the working people and was therefore completely correct.

    (3) Why is Bulgakov's play staged so many times? Perhaps because we have too few of our own plays that are suitable for staging. When there are no plays, even "The Days of the Turbins" is a play. Of course, it is easy to "criticize" and demand the banning of non-proletarian literature. But the easiest cannot be considered the best. The problem is not to ban, but to gradually drive out the new and old inferior non-proletarian works from the stage in a competitive manner, by creating real, interesting, artistic, and Soviet plays that can replace them. And competition is a huge and serious matter, because only in the case of competition can the formation and crystallization of our proletarian literature and art be achieved.

    As for the play "The Days of the Turbins," it is not that bad, because it does more good than harm to us. Do not forget: the main impression that this play leaves on the audience is a favorable impression of the Bolsheviks: "If even people like the Turbins have to admit that their cause has completely failed, lay down their arms, and bow to the will of the people—then it can be seen that the Bolsheviks are invincible, and no one can do anything about them, about the Bolsheviks." "The Days of the Turbins" is a demonstration of the invincible power of Bolshevism.

    Of course, the author is not "guilty" of this demonstration at all. But what does this have to do with us?

    (4) Indeed, Svidzersky often comes up with the most incredible mistakes and distortions. But, indeed, the Theater Repertoire Committee also makes many mistakes in its work, although on the other hand. Please recall "The Crimson Island," "The Conspiracy of Two Opponents," and other such inferior works, which were willingly passed by the Theater Repertoire Committee for the truly bourgeois Kamerny Theater to stage for some reason.

    (5) As for the "rumors" about "liberalism," it is better not to talk about them—let the Moscow landladies engage in "rumors."

                         February 2, 1929

    (Note) "Golovanovism" is manifested in the attempt of some theater staff to move the old bourgeois habits and working methods into the Soviet theater. In 1926-1928, a group of actors at the "Bolshoi Theater," led by conductor Golovanov, opposed innovation and the creation of new theatrical performances suitable for the huge demands of the broad masses and the tasks of socialist construction. This group opposed the entire staff of the theater and refused to promote new actors. The measures taken by the Party to transform the work of the Soviet theater ensured the overcoming of "Golovanovism." - Editorial Department of Volume 11 of "The Complete Works of Stalin"

　　给比尔——别洛采尔科夫斯基的回信
    斯大林
    编者按：这封信写于一九二九年二月二日。第一次刊印于一九四九年苏联国家政治书籍出版局印行的《斯大林全集》第十一卷。这封信提出了如何在文艺思想战线上进行斗争的重要的原则，对于我们是有很大的现实的教育意义的。比尔——别洛采尔科夫斯基同志：
    信写得太迟了。但是迟了总比不写好些。
    （一）我认为在文艺方面（也就是说，在戏剧方面）提出“右倾分子”和“左倾分子”的问题是不正确的。“右倾分子”或“左倾分子”的概念现在在我国是党的概念，严格讲来，是党内的概念。“右倾分子”和“左倾分子”——这是离开真正党的路线而偏到这边或那边的人们。因此，如果把这些概念应用于像文艺、戏剧等等这样非党的和无比广大的领域，那就奇怪了。这些概念倒可以应用于党的（共产主义的）某一文艺小组。在这种小组里可以有“右倾分子”和“左倾分子”。但是把这些概念应用于在当前发展阶段上的文艺，而其中又有各种各样的派别，直到反苏维埃的和简直是反革命的派别为止——那就是把一切概念倒置起来。最正确的就是在文艺领域里应用属于阶级一类的概念，甚至于运用“苏维埃的”、“反苏维埃的”、“革命的”、“反革命的”等等概念。
    （二）由此可以得出结论说：我不能把《哥洛万诺夫主义》（注）算作“右倾的”或“左倾的”危险，——它是在党内派别范围以外。《哥洛万诺夫主义》是属于反苏维埃一类的现象。当然，由此不能得出结论说：哥洛万诺夫自己不能改正过来，他不能摆脱自己的错误；甚至当他甘愿与自己的错误诀别的时候，我们也必须追究和处罚他，我们也必须这样地强迫他出国。
    或者，例如，布尔加可夫的《逃亡》，也不能算作“左倾”或“右倾”危险的表现。《逃亡》是表现企图引起对某些反苏维埃的侨民阶层的可怜，即使不是同情，——因此，这是企图辩护或半辩护白党的勾当。《逃亡》像现在这个样子是反苏维埃的现象。
    然而我完全不反对上演《逃亡》，如果布尔加可夫给自己的八个梦再加上一两个梦，在这一两个梦里描写苏联国内战争内在的社会动力，使观众能了解所有这些特别“忠诚的”雪拉芬英和各种各样的大学讲师被赶出俄国并不是由于布尔什维克的一时高兴，而是因为他们（不管他们如何“忠诚”）以前骑在人民的脖子上，布尔什维克把这些拥护剥削的“忠诚的”的人们赶了出去，是实现工农群众的意志，因此做得完全正确。
    （三）为什么布尔加可夫的剧本这样多次地上演呢？也许因为我们自己的适于上演的剧本太少了。在没有剧本的时候，甚至《土尔平们的日子》——也是一个剧本。当然，“批评”和要求禁止非无产阶级的文学是很容易的。但是最容易的不能认为就是最好的。问题不在于禁止，而在于用竞赛的方式，用创造能够取而代之的、真正的、有趣的、富于艺术性的、具有苏维埃性质的剧本，去一步一步地把新的和旧的非无产阶级的低劣作品从舞台上驱逐出去。而竞赛是一件巨大而严重的事情，因为只有在竞赛情况下才能够达到我们无产阶级文艺的形成和结晶化。
    至于说到《土尔平们的日子》这个剧本，它并不是那样坏，因为它给我们的益处比害处多些。不要忘记：这个剧本留给观众的主要印象是对布尔什维克有利的印象：“如果甚至像土尔平们那样的人都不得不承认自己的事业完全失败了，放下武器，向人民的意志低头，——那末，可见布尔什维克是不可战胜的，任何人对于他们、对于布尔什维克是一点办法也没有的。”《土尔平们的日子》是布尔什维主义战无不胜的力量的示威。
    当然，作者对这种示威是一点“罪过”也没有的。但是这和我们有什么关系呢？
    （四）的确，斯维杰尔斯基常常搞出最不可思议的错误和歪曲行为来。但是，的确，戏剧上演委员会在自己的工作中所搞出的错误也不少，虽然是在另一方面。请回忆一下《紫红色的岛》、《两个对手的阴谋》以及这类低劣作品，它们不知道为什么竟被戏剧上演委员会很乐意地通过给真正资产阶级的卡梅尔奈戏院上演呢。
    （五）至于说到关于“自由主义”的“传闻”，那末最好是不讲吧，——让莫斯科的老板太太们去从事“传闻”吧。
                         约·斯大林
                         一九二九年二月二日
    （注）《哥洛万诺夫主义》是表现在某一部分戏剧工作人员之企图把旧的资产阶级的风习和工作方法搬到苏维埃剧院里来。在一九二六——一九二八年，“大剧院”的一群演员以乐队指挥哥洛万诺夫为首反对革新和创造适合于广大群众巨大要求和社会主义建设任务的新的戏剧上演节目。这一群人与戏院全体工作人员对立起来，拒绝提拔新的演员人材。党所采取的关于改造苏维埃剧院工作的措施，保障了克服《哥洛万诺夫主义》。——《斯大林全集》第十一卷编辑部
