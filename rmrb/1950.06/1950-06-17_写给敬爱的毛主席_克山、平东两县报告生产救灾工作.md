　　A Letter to the Beloved Chairman Mao
    Keshan and Pingdong Counties Report on Production and Disaster Relief Work

Beloved Chairman Mao:
    The Third People's Representative Conference of Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, has concluded victoriously. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and you over the past few years, the people of our county have carried out land reform, overthrown feudal forces, supported the Liberation War, and launched three years of production campaigns. The people of the whole county are generally living a democratic life with food and clothing. The conference elected people they trusted to be the county head and government committee members to manage their own government. We have become masters of our own destiny.
    Our conference, in a democratic spirit, reviewed and approved the past work of the government, and decided on the agricultural production increase targets for the county. We will improve agricultural technology, make good use of 1,400 cultivator-harrows and new farm tools; consolidate production teams, ensure three hoeings and three harrowings, and strive for four hoeings and four harrowings; properly settle immigrants, run cooperatives well, strengthen urban-rural mutual assistance; and ensure the production of 845,000 *shi* of good grain, so that the people's lives in the county continue to improve. We are determined to work in depth, implement the resolutions of this representative conference, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship; increase agricultural production, support the People's Liberation Army in advancing into Taiwan and Tibet, and liberate all of China! The people of our county resolutely support your leadership. And wish you eternal health!

Beloved Chairman Mao:
    The Third People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Pingdong County, Shandong Province, officially opened on June 1st. The representative conference summarized the county's spring work. This spring, the county planted 370,000 *mu* of spring fields, and eliminated more than 1,200 *mu* of wasteland, achieving no abandoned land. The county dredged 348 rivers and ditches, totaling 548 *li*, employing more than 200,000 civilian laborers, including 1,164 women who actively participated. In terms of relief work, 1.2 million *jin* of grain was distributed for adjustment, 230,000 *jin* of grain was loaned by the bank, 220,000 *jin* of grain was mutually aided by the masses, and more than 400,000 *jin* of grain was distributed for relief, so that 22,000 severely affected households received relief and were able to concentrate on production. This is all the result of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. In addition, we also focused on studying the summer work. The representative conference decided that the county's summer work will continue to focus on production and relief, with summer harvesting, summer planting, and summer hoeing as the key points, closely combined with disaster relief and famine preparedness. At the same time, we must also do a good job in summer flood prevention, summer grain requisition, and other work. We especially report to you. Wishing you good health!
          The Entire Delegation of the Third People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Pingdong County, Shandong Province.
                                               June 3rd
