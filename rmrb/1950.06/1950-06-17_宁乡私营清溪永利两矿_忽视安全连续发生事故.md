　　Ningxiang Private Qingxi and Yongli Mines Neglect Safety, Leading to Continuous Accidents
    [Yiyang Dispatch] The Qingxi and Yongli private coal mines in Ningxiang District, Hunan, have been repeatedly plagued by accidents such as collapses, fires, and flooding since February of this year because the capitalists only care about making money and ignore mine safety. A total of 23 workers have been killed or injured, and nearly 1,000 workers have been left unemployed.
    In terms of production, the two mines have always disregarded engineering standards, digging wherever coal is found, and the underground equipment is extremely rudimentary. There is a lot of gas in the coal tunnels, and because there are not enough electric lights, the workers go down the mine with oil lamps, which caused the fire on May 6; also, because there are not enough water pumps and the pumping is not timely, the two mines were tragically flooded on May 24.
    After the incidents occurred, the local government and the trade union have paid serious attention to them and are now studying how to deal with them.

　　宁乡私营清溪永利两矿  忽视安全连续发生事故
    【本报益阳讯】湖南宁乡一区清溪、永利两私营煤矿，因资方只顾赚钱，不顾矿井安全，以致今年二月以来，该两矿接连发生塌陷、失火、淹没等事故，前后死伤工人二十三名，并使将近一千名工人陷于失业。
    在生产上，该两矿一向不讲工程规格，见煤就挖，井下设备也极简陋。煤洞内瓦斯很重，因为没有足够的电灯，工人带着油灯下井，因此造成五月六日的失火事件；又因水泵不够，抽水不及，使两矿于五月二十四日惨遭淹没。
    事件发生后，当地政府和工会已予以严重注意，现正研究处理中。
