Towing Broken Locomotives North for Repair
    Damaged Approximately 4,000 Sections of Rail
    Ministry of Railways Has Instructed Relevant Departments to Investigate

[This Newspaper News] Reporter Lü Guangming reports: On the afternoon of May 1st, the No. 1602 freight train, heading north from Zhengzhou via Xuzhou and Jinan, was towing two fireless, broken locomotives, ㄇㄎ一, No. 739 and ㄇㄎ一, No. 779, at the rear. These two locomotives were being sent to the Changxindian Railway Machinery Plant for repair. On one of the locomotives, No. 779, the third driving wheel had no spring, allowing the wheel to move freely up and down. As a result, the wheel was suspended in the air by about ten centimeters at high speeds. During the train's journey, it damaged approximately 4,000 sections of rail, with a total length of 200 kilometers. After the incident, the Jinan Railway Bureau's Engineering Department investigated and found that the damage was most severe between the Tai'an and Baimashan stations. According to the field investigation reports from the various track foremen in the area, 2,132 rails were damaged along the line between Jieshou and Baimashan. Among them, 335 were unusable, 707 were severely damaged, and 1,090 were slightly damaged. After the train passed Jinan and headed north on the afternoon of May 1st, a gateman outside Gushan Station near the Jinan Bureau discovered a broken fishplate. Track workers in the Chaomidian and Dangjiazhuang station sections also discovered two rails with large longitudinal cracks. The next morning, when the track workers went to work, they found that the east rail had bent inward by nine millimeters. After investigating the cause, they remembered that the sound of the train passing the previous afternoon was unusual. After this incident occurred, Cheng Guohua, the chief of the track maintenance section of the Jinan Bureau's Engineering Department, went to the scene to investigate. The damage caused by the faulty wheel was that every rotation (every 4.3 to 4.4 meters) resulted in a pit or groove 200 millimeters long and 40 to 50 millimeters wide. He stated, "More than 300 rails with serious splits need to be replaced immediately. Although the others do not need to be replaced immediately, the service life of the rails has been greatly reduced." Upon learning of this, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has instructed relevant departments to organize an inspection to take appropriate action.

　　拖运破机车北上修理
    砸伤钢轨约四千条
    铁道部已责成有关部门检查
    【本报讯】记者吕光明报道：五月一日下午，自郑州经徐州、济南北上之一六○二次货物列车后部，拖运ㄇㄎ一、七三九号、ㄇㄎ一、七七九号两台无火之破机车，该两台机车是送往长辛店铁路机厂修理的。其中一台七七九号的第三动轮，因无弹簧，车轮可自由上下游动，所以速度高时车轮空悬约十公分；在车行途中砸伤钢轨约四千条，其总长度达二百公里。事后经济南铁路局工务处调查，尤以泰安到白马山两站区间的毁损程度最为严重。根据该管区各领工实地调查报告，界首、白马山间沿线伤损钢轨二一三二条，其中不堪使用的达三三五条、重伤者七○七条、轻伤者一○九○条。该列车于五月一日下午通过济南北上后，济南局附近的崮山站外闸夫发现有一块夹板破裂。炒米店、党家庄两站区间的道班工人也发现有两根钢轨有了顺长的大裂纹。次日晨，各道班工人上班后，发现东股钢轨多向内弯拱了九公厘，追察原因，才想起昨日下午车行声音不对。此事件发生后，济南局工务处养路科长程国铧曾往现场调查，其砸伤情况是，该机车之坏轮每转一周，（隔四·三公尺到四·四公尺）即砸有长二百公厘、宽四五十公厘的坑条，据谈：“严重劈裂需要立即更换的钢轨有三百多条。其余虽不需马上更换，也大大缩减了钢轨的使用寿命。”中央人民政府铁道部得悉后，已责成有关部门组织检查，以便作适当处理。
