Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd, TASS dispatch from June 22nd citing the Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata": The Japanese Communist Party held a national congress in Tokyo on the 18th, under the auspices of the Japanese Communist Party's provisional central leadership. Members of the provisional central leadership, alternate members of the Central Committee, members of the Central Audit Committee, and representatives of local Communist Party organizations attended the meeting.

　　Ritsuta Ichizo, a member of the Provisional Central Leadership, stated in his opening address that the purpose of the meeting was to determine the Party's tasks in the new situation, which arose due to new fascist persecutions that prevented all Central Committee members from engaging in political activities.

　　Shiino Etsuro, chairman of the Japanese Communist Party's Provisional Central Leadership, delivered a general report at the meeting. The meeting unanimously approved Shiino's general report and his concluding remarks.

　　The meeting concluded by passing the following resolution: "The people's forces, led by our Party, are constantly and rapidly growing under the cruel persecution and suppression of the reactionaries.

　　Revolutionary history tells us that our revolutionary struggle is developing under tempestuous circumstances, and our vanguard party is strengthening its Bolshevik iron unity.

　　The illegal suppression of our Party's Central Committee members cannot stop our struggle, not even for a moment. On the contrary, under the leadership of the Provisional Central Leadership, we will continue to wage an unyielding struggle.

　　The National Congress of the Japanese Communist Party, held under difficult conditions, unanimously approved Shiino's general report and approved the measures taken by the Central Audit Committee.

　　The meeting pledged to resolutely eliminate any sectarian activities on the basis of implementing these resolutions and to make new contributions to our Party's glorious history."

    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社二十二日电引日共机关报赤旗报消息：日本共产党于十八日在日本共产党临时中央领导机关的主持下，在东京举行全国代表大会。临时中央领导机关的委员、中央委员会候补委员、中央监察委员会委员和地方共产党组织的代表均出席会议。
    临时中央领导机关委员轮田一造在会议开幕词中说：此次会议的目的，在于确定党在新情况下的任务，这个新情况是由于新的法西斯迫害使全体中央委员不能从事政治活动而产生的。

    会议在结束时通过下列决议：“以我们的党为首的人民力量，在反动派残酷的迫害和镇压的情况下，正在不断和迅速地成长着。
    革命的历史告诉我们：我们的革命斗争是在狂风暴雨般的形势下发展起来的，我们先锋队的党，正在加强它布尔什维克的铁的团结。
    非法镇压我们党的中央委员，决不能使我们停止斗争，即使是片刻也不能。相反的，在临时中央领导机关的领导下，我们将继续作顽强的斗争。
    在困难的条件下举行的日本共产党全国代表大会，一致同意椎野的总报告，并批准中央监察委员会的各项措施。
    会议保证在实现这些决议的基础上坚决地消除任何宗派活动，对我们党的光荣历史作出新的贡献。”
