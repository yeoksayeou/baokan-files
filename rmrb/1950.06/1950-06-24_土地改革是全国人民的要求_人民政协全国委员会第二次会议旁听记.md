　　Land Reform is the Demand of the Whole People
    ——Notes from Attending the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
    Lu Hao
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the issue of land reform reflects the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. This is not only because land reform supported the victory of the People's Liberation War, but also because it will create favorable conditions for our country to move towards industrialization.

    How land reform supported the victory of the war can be told by Li Xiuzhen, a farmer from Donggucheng Village in Pingyuan Province, a famous female hero who persisted in fighting behind enemy lines and who is attending the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During the war years, Li Xiuzhen not only dedicated her 27-year-old son to the sacred cause of national liberation, but also risked her life countless times to persist behind enemy lines. Her hometown is a large village of 600 households, but 21 landlords and rich peasants occupied 80 percent of the village's more than 6,000 mu of land. More than half of the village were poor and landless peasants, and Li Xiuzhen was one of them, without even a furrow of land. Because land reform was implemented in the spring of 1947, Li Xiuzhen was allocated 17 mu of land. The vast majority of poor and landless peasants in the village, like her, have now shaken off thousands of years of feudal exploitation and are gradually rising to the level of middle peasants. Li Xiuzhen is one of the millions of liberated peasants in the liberated areas. If anyone asks her why she was so brave, then, in addition to the education given to her by the great communist ideals, it is the ranks of the liberated peasants who stood with her forever to fight to keep their land. Li Xiuzhen said: "Without land reform, we could not defeat the enemy."

    Without land reform, who could imagine how to persist in the cruel struggles of the Red Soviet era for so long? In 1933, during the land investigation movement, in Wangtian District, Ruijin County, Jiangxi, more than 20,000 poor peasants each re-divided one dan and two dou of grain-yielding land. Relying on the unprecedented increase in the enthusiasm of the masses, more than 700 people joined the Ruijin Red Army Model Division in 55 days, without a single deserter. Economic construction bonds were promoted; cooperatives were developed; and clubs, literacy classes, and night schools were increased, making the whole district look brand new.

    In those severely difficult days of the past, without thorough land reform, it is unthinkable how the difficulties of the time could have been overcome. People should remember that the people of Northeast China suffered a strong attack from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in 1946, but why did the war situation in Northeast China change so quickly after only a short year? It is indeed as General Lin Biao said: "The decisive key lies in mobilizing the masses." In the year from July 1946 to May 1947, the Northeast region resolutely implemented land reform, thus helping 4.2 million peasants to free themselves from feudal exploitation and obtain 33 million mu of land. This enabled the broad masses to participate in and support the People's Liberation Army fighting in the Northeast out of their own vital interests, laying an invincible foundation for the people's democratic cause in the Northeast. It also created favorable conditions for the Northeast to turn to the offensive militarily a year later, thereby launching a counter-offensive across the country.

    History has proven that thorough land reform is so powerful in enabling the war to achieve great victory; at present, it is also the most important condition for the development of production in our country.

    In areas where land reform has been completed, how rural productive forces have been liberated so that agricultural production can be developed can be seen in the vivid facts of Taipingzhuang, a village of 432 households in Huaian County, Chahar. After land reform, the whole village not only planted 9,200 mu of land last year, but also sowed seeds on more than 1,000 mu of land that had been barren for many years, and newly reclaimed more than 80 mu of virgin land. The annual grain output increased by 420 shi, and this year's increase is expected to be double that of last year. In the words of farmer Hou Youyao: "Last year, more than 30 mu of land yielded two more shi of grain and more than a dozen sacks of yams than in previous years. There hasn't been such a good harvest in nearly 40 years." This is the happy voice of millions of peasants after land reform. A survey of seven villages in Wuxiang County, Shanxi, which had been burned, killed, and looted by Japanese imperialism but had undergone thorough land reform, showed that agricultural production in 1949 had recovered to 96 percent of the average production level before the war (1932 to 1937). The recovery and development of agricultural production can ensure sufficient food and raw materials for industrial production, and industrialists and businessmen will have a broad market. Therefore, land reform is not only an urgent demand of the peasants all over the country, but also should be welcomed by industrialists and businessmen all over the country. The completion of land reform in the entire Northeast region not only became an important reason for supporting the victory of the war, but also developed agricultural production and greatly increased the purchasing power of peasants, opening up a road for the industrialization of our country. The actual sales of cloth in the first quarter of 1950 in Northeast China were 2.5 million bolts, an increase of 11.5 times compared with the average quarterly sales of 200,000 bolts in 1947. In some places, the purchasing power of peasants after land reform has reached an unexpected level. Last year, state-owned stores in the Northeast originally planned to purchase 900,000 tons of grain, but they received 1.7 million tons, and peasants still had 1 million tons of grain that they were eager to sell. The purchasing power of peasants in the Northeast after land reform has reached more than 5 million tons of grain this year. This is the huge change that land reform has brought about in the economic life of the peasant masses, and this is an indispensable condition for our country to open up the road to industrialization.

    In order to realize the demands of the people of the whole country, at the second session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Draft Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China was enthusiastically supported by all democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic classes, and ethnic groups. Including Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou, uprising generals who belonged to the landlord class, expressed their agreement with land reform.

    Undeniable historical facts prove that Comrade Shaoqi's report on land reform at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference deeply expressed the common aspirations of the people of the whole country. In the future great national land reform movement, let the various opinions that defend the landlord class and oppose and doubt land reform be spurned by the people of the whole country and enter the grave along with the fate of the landlord class!

　　土地改革是全国人民的要求
    ——人民政协全国委员会第二次会议旁听记
    陆灏
    刘少奇同志关于土地改革问题的报告，是全国人民一致的要求。这不但是因为土地改革曾经支持了人民解放战争的胜利；同时因为它将为我国走向工业化创造良好的条件。
    土地改革怎样支持了战争的胜利，让著名全国坚持敌后斗争的女英雄，出席人民政协全国委员会的平原省董堌城村农民李秀真告诉你。李秀真在战争的年月，她不但将二十七岁的儿子奉献给神圣的祖国解放的事业，而自己也冒着无数次生命的危险坚持在敌后。李秀真的故乡是个六百户的大村，二十一家地主富农却占有了全村六千多亩土地的百分之八十。全村有一半以上是贫雇农，李秀真就是地无一垅的一个。由于一九四七年春天实行了土地改革，李秀真分得了十七亩土地。全村绝大多数的贫雇农和她一样，今天摆脱了几千年的封建剥削，均已逐渐上升为中农。李秀真就是解放区千百万翻身农民的一个，如果有人问她为什么能够那样勇敢，那么，除了伟大的共产主义的理想予她的教育外，那就是和她永远站在一起的翻身农民的队伍为了保持土地而斗争。李秀真说：“没有土地改革，就不能打败敌人。”
    没有土地改革，谁能够设想怎样长期坚持红色苏维埃时代残酷的斗争。在一九三三年，在查田运动中，江西瑞金县的王田区，两万余贫苦农民每人重新分得了一担二斗谷的土地，依靠了群众积极性的空前提高，五十五天中七百余人参加了瑞金的红军模范师，没有一个开小差。推销了经济建设公债；发展了合作社；增加了俱乐部、识字班和夜学，使全区面貌焕然一新。
    在过去那些严重的艰苦的日子里，要是没有彻底的土地改革，不能设想如何能够度过当时的困难。人们应该记得东北人民在一九四六年曾经遭受着蒋家匪帮的强大进攻，但为什么只是经过短短的一年，东北的战局就焕然改观。诚然是林彪将军所说：“决定的关键在发动群众”。东北地区在一九四六年七月至一九四七年五月这一年中，坚决的实行了土地改革，因而帮助四百二十万农民从封建剥削下翻了身，取得了三千三百万亩土地。这就使得广大群众为了捍卫自己切身的利益，源源不绝地、自愿地参加和支援了在东北作战的人民解放军，使东北的人民民主事业奠定了不可战胜的基础。并为一年以后的东北在军事上变为进攻，从而为全国的反攻，创造了一个有利的条件。
    历史证明了彻底的土地改革是这样有力的使战争获得了伟大胜利；在目前，又是我国发展生产头等重要的条件。
    在已经完成土地改革的地区，怎样解放了农村生产力，以使农业生产能够得到发展，察哈尔怀安县的四百三十二户的太平庄，就有生动的事实。全村经过土改以后，去年除种完了九千二百亩地，还在多年荒芜的一千多亩土地上播种，并新开白茬地八十多亩。全年增产粮四百二十石，今年增产预计比去年可加一倍。按农民侯有耀的话说：“去年比往年，三十多亩地多打二石谷子，十多口袋山药，近四十年没有这样的好收成。”这就是千百万经过土地改革以后的农民快乐的声音。经过日本帝国主义烧杀掠夺的，但经过彻底的土地改革的山西武乡县所作过七个村庄的调查，说明一九四九年的农业生产，已恢复到战前（一九三二年至一九三七年）平均生产水平的百分之九十六强。农业生产的恢复与发展，食粮和工业生产的原料就能有充足的保障，工商业者就有了广阔的市场。因此，土地改革不但为全国农民迫切的要求，同时也应为全国工商业者所欢迎。东北全区由于完成了土地改革，不但成为支援战争胜利的重要原因，同时也发展了农业生产，大大提高了农民的购买力，为我国工业化开辟了道路。全东北一九五零年度第一季实销布二百五十万匹，和一九四七年平均每季销布二十万匹相比，布的销量增加了十一倍半。经过土地改革后农民的购买力有的地方已经达到出人意外的程度。东北国营商店去年原计划收购九十万吨粮食，结果收到一百七十万吨，农民手里还有百万吨粮食急于卖出，经过土地改革以后的东北农民购买力，今年已达五百余万吨粮食。这就是土地改革在农民群众的经济生活中引起的巨大变化，这就是我国开辟工业化道路不可缺少的条件。
    为了实现全国人民的要求，在人民政协第二次的全国委员会上，中华人民共和国土地改革法草案受到全国各民主党派、各人民团体、各民主阶级、各民族热烈的拥护。包括属于地主阶级成份的、起义的将领刘文辉、邓锡侯，都对土地改革表示同意。
    无可争辩的历史的事实，证明少奇同志在人民政协全国委员会上关于土地改革的报告，深切的说出了全国人民共同的心愿。在未来伟大的全国土地改革运动中，让那些为地主阶级辩护的各种反对与怀疑土地改革的意见，受到全国人民的唾弃，随同地主阶级的命运一块进入坟墓吧！
