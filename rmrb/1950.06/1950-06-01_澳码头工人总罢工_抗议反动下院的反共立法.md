　　Australian Dockworkers' General Strike
    Protests Reactionary Lower House's Anti-Communist Legislation
    [Xinhua News Agency, 30th] Australian workers are fiercely opposing the Menzies government's anti-communist legislation, passed by the reactionary Australian lower house on the 23rd, which aims to stifle democracy. According to a Moscow broadcast on the 25th, on May 24th, the day after the Australian lower house passed the anti-communist bill, dockworkers and harbor workers across Australia launched a general strike to oppose the government's plot to ban the Communist Party.
    The workers held mass rallies, at which resolutions were passed condemning the bill and denouncing the trade union council for not opposing the entire bill, but only supporting certain insignificant amendments added by the Labor Party.
    The resolution pointed out that if the bill becomes law, the amended policies cannot guarantee the freedom and rights of citizens. The resolution specifically pointed out that the bill to dissolve the Australian Communist Party threatens the very existence of trade union organizations.
    These resolutions have been supported by the majority of workers in enterprises across the country. Australia's largest newspaper, "The Sydney Morning Herald," has had to admit that it has received a large number of letters opposing the bill.

　　澳码头工人总罢工
    抗议反动下院的反共立法
    【新华社三十日讯】澳洲工人猛烈反对澳反动下院于二十三日通过孟席斯政府扼杀民主的反共立法。据莫斯科二十五日广播悉尼消息：五月二十四日，即澳大利亚下院通过反共法案的次日，全澳码头工人和海港工人举行总罢工，反对政府取缔共产党的图谋。
    工人们举行了群众大会，会上通过决议谴责该法案，并斥责工会理事会不反对整个法案，而只支持工党所加的某些无关大局的修正。
    决议指出：如果法案成为法律，修正政策并不能保障公民的自由和权利。决议并特别指出：解散澳共的法案，将威胁工会组织本身的存在。
    这些决议受到全国多数企业工人的拥护。澳大利亚最大报纸《悉尼晨报》也不得不承认该报接到大批反对法案的来信。
