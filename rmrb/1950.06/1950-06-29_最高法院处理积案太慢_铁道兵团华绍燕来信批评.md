　　Supreme People's Court Too Slow in Handling Backlogged Cases
　　Letter of Criticism from Hua Shaoyan of the Railway Corps
　　To the Editorial Comrades:
　　I was entrusted by a relative in Tianjin to inquire about a case at the Supreme People's Court. I went there at a little after 10:00 AM on May 22nd. Upon entering, I first went to the reception room, where two comrades, about forty or fifty years old, were dozing off. I woke them up and explained my purpose. They told me to go to the "Question and Answer Writing Service" myself. The room there was very small, and there were fourteen or fifteen fellow villagers waiting, most of them looking tired, probably because they had been waiting for quite some time. Only two comrades were handling the answering of questions. I stood for a while and saw that it was unlikely to be my turn even by twelve o'clock. So I returned to the reception room, hoping they could lead me to the place where files are checked to ask about it. The comrades in the reception room said very unhappily to me: "Come back after 2:00 PM. Some people have been waiting for several days!" I silently retreated and went to knock on the door of the mailroom. There were many people in this room. I explained my purpose to a female comrade nearby, and she listened patiently. Then she asked an older comrade across from her to check the incoming document register for November and December of last year. But that comrade said several times that it couldn't be done. He also said: "There's no receiving document number here, so there's no way to check. Last year's are all locked in the big cabinet; what if everyone came to check?" He said it would be best to submit a request letter. I said: "This time, the petition I was entrusted to send is the second time. I submitted it once on the 13th of this month!" At this point, a male comrade in his thirties nearby casually found the receiving document register for November of last year, and in less than three minutes, he found the entire case of Tianjin People's Court, Class C, General Dispatch No. 3265 in the receiving document register No. 392 of November 10th. This case is an ordinary rent dispute, but it has been shelved in the Supreme People's Court for more than half a year, and it is still unknown when this case will be processed. I hope that the Supreme People's Court can thoroughly change this work style and improve work efficiency.

　　最高法院处理积案太慢
    铁道兵团华绍燕来信批评编辑同志：
    我受天津一位亲戚来信之托，到最高法院查询一件案子。我是五月二十二日上午十点多去的。进门先到传达室，里面有两位四五十岁的老同志在打盹。我惊醒他们，说明了来意。他叫我自己到“问答代书处”去。那里屋很小，坐着等的老乡有十四五位，且多带倦容，大概是等的时间不小了。这里只有两位同志办理答问事宜。我站了一会，看情形到十二点也轮不到我。于是又回到传达室，希望他们能领我到查卷的地方问一下。传达室的同志很不高兴地对我说：“下午两点以后再来。人家还有等好几天的呢！”我无言的退出来，去敲收发室的门。这屋里的人很多。我就近向一位女同志说明来意，她很耐心地听完后，就请对面一位年岁较大的同志给查查去年十一、二月的收文簿。但那位同志说了几个不行。又说：“没有这边的收文字号，没法查。去年的都在大柜中锁着了，若都来查怎么办？”他说最好上个催请书。我说：“我这次受托送来的呈文已是第二次了。本月十三日已呈上一次了！”说到这，旁边一位三十来岁的男同志随手找到去年十一月份的收文簿，结果没三分钟的功夫，就在十一月十日第三九二号收文簿上，找到天津人民法院丙一总发第三二六五号的全案。这案子是件普通的房租纠纷，竟在最高法院搁了半年多，直到现在还不知这案子什么时候才能处理。我希望最高法院能彻底改变这种工作作风，提高工作效率。
