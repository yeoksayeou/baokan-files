　　Northeast Railways Fully Launches Iron Ox Movement
　　Fifteen Thousand Railway Employees Involved in Competition, Boosting Efficiency and Completing Transportation Tasks Successfully
　　[Our Newspaper News] Reporter Jian Qing reports: In order to implement the People's Railway's management policy of "improving efficiency, reducing costs, and safely completing national transportation tasks," the Northeast Railway system launched the region-wide Iron Ox Movement in September of last year. This movement has gradually expanded from the locomotive department to the traffic, engineering, telecommunications, and factory departments. As of May 1st, 150,000 employees and technicians have been involved in this movement. A total of 10,979 outstanding employees have been rewarded, and 2,574 units have been honored with the title of "Iron Ox." Through various means, the vast number of employees have launched revolutionary heroic competitions, creating huge amounts of wealth for the country. For example, last winter's transportation volume increased by 194% compared to the same period of the previous year, operating income increased by 255% compared to the same period of the previous year, and the accident rate decreased by 32%. A total of 123,727 tons of coal were saved in five months. The total vehicle turnaround rate was also shortened from 5.21 days in the previous year to 3.54 days. In 1948, the Northeast Railway pioneered a new driving method to shorten the vehicle turnaround rate. Locomotive No. 96 of the Suihua Locomotive Depot of the Harbin Railway Administration, drawing on advanced Soviet experience and implementing the responsibility system and joint labor method, took the lead. On December 15 of the same year, the locomotive set a new record of reaching a technical speed of 40 kilometers. Subsequently, the locomotive took the lead in breaking through two Class A inspection periods, safely traveling more than 106,000 kilometers, and reducing maintenance costs for the country by more than 150 million yuan; it also generated more than 90 million yuan in freight revenue, making a great contribution to improving efficiency, reducing costs, and safely completing national transportation tasks. Therefore, in February 1949, the locomotive was officially named "Iron Ox" by the Harbin Railway Administration. Thus, the Iron Ox Movement was initiated.
　　On May 1, 1949, the Northeast Railway Bureau held the first Model Worker Conference, and Du Xianyang, the driver of the Iron Ox locomotive, was awarded the title of Northeast Railway Labor Hero. In September of last year, the Northeast Railway Locomotive Conference and the Northeast Railway Trade Union Work Conference decided to take the Iron Ox locomotive as a banner and fully launch the Iron Ox Movement. In the past ten months, the movement has been carried out vigorously. Under the demonstration and guidance of the Iron Ox locomotive and inspired by the Iron Ox Movement, many glorious model production units and individuals have emerged. In terms of locomotives, there was the Linkou Locomotive Depot, where most of the locomotives in the entire depot were awarded the title of Iron Ox and safely traveled 1.05 million kilometers; there was the No. 631 passenger locomotive led by Wang Fengming, which safely traveled more than 170,000 kilometers beyond the Class A inspection mileage; and there was the No. 1092 locomotive driven by Wang Changcai, which exceeded the traction quota by one time, pulling 2,200 tons. In terms of vehicle maintenance, there was the model Huangguatun Train Inspection Station, which completed 57 major repairs in 12 hours. In terms of traffic dispatching, there was dispatcher Su Yuanpeng, who consistently maintained train punctuality. In terms of engineering, there was the Taipingchuan Engineering Section led by Wang Laibao and Liu Qingshan, which enabled trains to travel at a speed of 90 kilometers with a vibration of no more than 8 millimeters. In terms of telecommunications, there was the Sankeshu Telecommunications Section, which implemented a layer-by-layer contracting responsibility system, greatly saving labor and improving quality. These have made great contributions to overcoming the country's financial difficulties and reducing railway costs. Currently, the Iron Ox Movement is continuing to deepen.

　　东北铁路全面开展铁牛运动
    十五万名铁路员工卷入竞赛热潮
    工作效率提高运输任务胜利完成
    【本报讯】记者剑清报道：为了贯彻人民铁道“提高效率，减低成本，安全完成国家运输任务”的经营方针，东北铁路系统，于去年九月，开展全区铁牛运动。这一运动已由机务部门逐渐扩展到车务、工务、电务、工厂等部门。截至五月一日止，已有十五万员工和技术人员卷入这一运动中。荣获奖励的优秀员工有一○、九七九名，荣膺“铁牛”称号的单位有二、五七四个。广大员工通过多种多样的方式，展开革命英雄主义竞赛，为国家创造了巨量的财富。例如：去年冬季运输量较前年同期增加百分之一九四，营业收入较前年同期增加百分之二五五，事故率减少了百分之三十二。五个月内共节省煤十二万三千七百二十七吨。车辆总周转率，也由上年度的五·二一天缩短到三·五四天。在一九四八年间，东北铁路为缩短车辆周转率，曾经创行新行车法。哈尔滨铁路管理局绥化机务段九十六号机车，接受苏联先进经验，实行负责制和联合劳动法，首先打响了头一炮。在同年十二月十五日，该机车创造了技术速度达到四十公里的新纪录。接着，该机车又带头突破两个甲检期，安全行走十万六千余公里，并替国家减少了一亿五千多万元的检修成本费；多收入了九千多万元的运费，对提高效率、减低成本、安全完成国家运输任务，贡献极大。因此，在一九四九年二月，该机车被哈尔滨铁路管理局正式命名为“铁牛”号。从此，揭开了铁牛运动的序幕。
    一九四九年五月一日，东北铁路总局召开首届劳模大会，铁牛号司机长杜先扬荣膺东北铁路劳动英雄的称号。去年九月，东北铁路机务会议和东北铁路工会工作会议决定，以铁牛号为旗帜，全面开展铁牛运动。十个月来，运动已轰轰烈烈地开展起来。在铁牛号示范引导，及铁牛运动的鼓舞下，涌现出许多光荣的模范生产单位和人物。在机车方面，出现了全段大部分机车荣膺铁牛称号，全段安全走行一百零五万公里的林口机务段；出现了超过十七万安全走行和甲检公里的王凤鸣所领导的六三一旅客机车；以及超过牵引定数一倍，牵引二千二百吨的王长材所驾驶的一○九二号机车。在车辆检修方面，则出现了十二小时做完五十七件大修的模范皇姑屯列车检查所。在车务调度上，出现了经常保持列车正点的调度员苏元鹏。在工务上，出现了王来宝、刘青山领导的使列车走行速度达到九十公里，震动不超过八粍的太平川工务段。在电务上，出现了实行层层包工负责制，大量节省人工和提高质量的三棵树电务段。这在克服国家财政困难，减低铁路成本上都有了巨大的贡献。目前铁牛运动正在继续深入开展中。
