　　Prices Shift from Decline to Stabilization
　　Wuhan Market Situation Improves
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 10th] Since mid-April, when prices in Wuhan shifted from a downward trend to stabilization, the market situation has begun to return to normal, and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas has gradually become more active.
　　In mid-March, prices in Wuhan began to fall. By early April, various commodities had generally fallen by about 25 to 30 percent. Market prices were far below the listed prices of state-owned trading companies, and the prices of several commodities were almost on par with those in the production areas. Since mid-April, the Central South Military and Political Committee and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government have provided various forms of support and have begun to make adjustments. State-owned trading departments have focused on purchasing industrial and agricultural products and have appropriately adjusted the exchange ratio of goods, so that prices have gradually returned to a normal and stable state. Since May, the market has continued to stabilize. In early May, prices of various goods only decreased by an average of 3.59 percent compared with late April; mid-May increased by 1.8 percent compared with early May; and late May increased by 5.9 percent compared with mid-May. The range of increases and decreases is generally very small. Market prices and listed prices have also gradually become closer. The prices of commodities such as cotton and general merchandise have gradually reached the appropriate and reasonable difference between production and sales areas.
　　The normalization and stabilization of prices has made market transactions and the exchange of industrial and agricultural products between urban and rural areas increasingly active. Comparing early May with late April, the volume of rice transactions increased by 52 percent, paddy rice increased by 50 percent, wheat increased by 39 percent, and cotton cloth increased by 15 percent. In mid-May, the volume of transactions for all goods, except for a slight decrease in grain and cloth, increased compared to early May; among them, sesame oil increased by 48.27 percent compared with early May, edible salt increased by 40.6 percent, raw silk increased by 100 percent, tobacco leaves increased by 12 percent, sheepskin increased by 35 percent, cowhide increased by 49 percent, bristles increased by 70 percent, and tung oil increased by 48.92 percent. In late May, the volume of transactions for rice, miscellaneous grains increased by 11.1 percent compared with mid-May, cotton cloth increased by 72 percent, and other cotton yarn, local products, etc. also increased.
　　Due to the gradual smooth flow of materials, the temporary difficult situation of sluggish commodity sales has been gradually opened up, and the operation of legitimate industrialists and businessmen has had a new turning point. According to statistics from the Wuhan Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce: in April, the ratio of applications for suspension and closure of businesses to applications for opening businesses in the city was about seven to one; in May, the situation changed greatly, with a sharp decrease in applications for suspension and closure of businesses, and the ratio of suspensions and closures to openings changed to seven to six. More than one-half of the newly opened businesses are industrial, and most of them are hardware, textile and other industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In addition, many factories and shops that were preparing to close have decided to continue operating. For example, more than ten department stores that have closed are preparing to reopen.

　　物价由落转趋平稳
    武汉市场情况好转
    【新华社汉口十日电】武汉市物价自四月中旬由下落转趋平稳以来，市场情况已开始转向正常，城乡物资交流渐显活跃。
    三月中旬武汉市物价开始下跌，至四月上旬止，各项商品普降百分之二十五到百分之三十左右，市价远落于国营贸易公司牌价之下，有数种商品的价格几与产区持平。四月中旬以后，中南军政委员会及武汉市人民政府的多方扶助和着手调整，国营贸易部门有重点地收购工农业产品，适当调整货品交换比价，使物价逐步转入正常平稳状态。五月以来，市场继续平稳，五月上旬各货价格平均只较四月下旬下降百分之三点五九；五月中旬较上旬上升百分之一点八；下旬较中旬上升百分之五点九，涨跌幅度，一般都很小。市价与牌价也已逐渐接近，棉花、百货等商品价格，则逐渐达到产、销区间应有的合理差额。
    物价的趋于正常平稳，使市场交易及城乡工农业品的交流日见活跃。以五月上旬与四月下旬比较，食米成交量增加百分之五十二，稻谷增加百分之五十，小麦增加百分之三十九，棉布增加百分之十五。五月中旬，各物成交量除粮食、布匹略形减少外，油盐及各种土产品均较上旬增加；其中麻油较上旬增加百分之四十八点二七，食盐增加百分之四十点六，蚕丝增加百分之百，烟叶增加百分之十二，羊皮增加百分之三十五，牛皮增加百分之四十九，猪鬃增加百分之七十，桐油增加百分之四十八点九二。五月下旬成交量，谷、米、杂粮较中旬增加百分之十一点一，棉布增加百分之七十二，其他棉纱、土产品等亦有增加。
    由于物资交流渐畅，商品滞销的暂时困难局面已被逐渐打开，正当工商业者的经营已有了新的转机。根据武汉市工商局的统计：四月份全市工商业申请停、歇业与申请开业两者约为七与一之比；五月份情况即大为改变，工商业申请停、歇业者锐减，停、歇业与开业相较已转变为七与六之比。新开业者工业占二分之一以上，且大部为有利国计民生的五金、纺织等业。此外，许多预备停业的工厂、商店，都已决定继续经营。如已停业的十余家百货业即正准备复业中。
