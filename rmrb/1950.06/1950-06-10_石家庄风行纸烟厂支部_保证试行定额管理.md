　　Shijiazhuang Fengxing Cigarette Factory Branch
    Guarantees Trial Implementation of Quota Management
    Sun Zhiwei, Ma Wenman
    The Shijiazhuang Fengxing Cigarette Factory branch played a guaranteeing and supervisory role in the implementation of quota management, enabling the quota work to be carried out smoothly. After the cigarette factory deployed the implementation of quota management, the branch discovered four ideological concerns among the workers during the deliberation and discussion: (1) Fear of quotas, believing that after quotas, they would not be as free as in the past, and they were afraid of being punished for not completing the task. (2) Willing to implement quotas, but the standards should be lower than the three previous competitions, so that it would be easier to exceed the quota and win prizes. (3) Emphasizing objective difficulties such as old machines and imperfect equipment, believing that quotas could not be implemented. (4) Not expressing opinions, just doing what everyone else does, and passively watching. Similar thoughts also existed among Party members, with doubts about the implementation of quota management. In order to dispel the ideological concerns of the workers and clear various obstacles, the branch decided to first resolve the thoughts of Party members who were afraid of difficulties, lacked confidence, and were passively inactive, and then mobilize all workers through the Youth League to break through their thoughts. The branch immediately convened a general meeting of all Party members, and also absorbed activists from the Communist Youth League to participate. During the discussion, many Party members put forward ways to overcome difficulties and favorable conditions, criticizing and reversing the erroneous thinking of emphasizing difficulties and falling behind the masses. For example, apprentice Zhang Yongze (probationary Party member) of Vehicle No. 4 said: "Old machines and imperfect equipment cannot implement quotas." Female worker Gao Shuxia (probationary Party member) of the packaging room said: "We must overcome difficulties, we should not emphasize difficulties. At the same time, our quota standards are not too high, but are based on the existing foundation. The quotas can be implemented." Some Party members believed that their wages were low, and the quota standards should also be low. Some people explained that Party members should play an exemplary role. If they first set the quota low, it would affect the masses' emphasis on difficulties and lack of confidence. During this discussion, some Party members and Youth League members were inspired to realize the importance of uniting the masses. For example, Youth League member Tian Jin'ai from the packaging room raised the question: "After the implementation of quotas, what if some workers lose the box skins and inner paper or waste them and steal from others?" Youth League member Du Xiuyun believed that Youth League members should be assigned to each group to monitor. Everyone believed that this was a wrong approach that underestimated and detached from the masses. They advocated uniting and educating the masses well. During the discussion, everyone made it clear that in the future, not only should Party members think of more ways to complete and exceed quotas, but they should also publicize, mobilize, and unite the masses to engage in quotas. Party members reached a consensus on the implementation of quota management ideologically, but they still had concerns about the standard of steaming 500 jin of tobacco leaves per hour. Li Lijun, the chairman of the trade union (who was administratively the leader of the steaming group), wrote a note after the meeting: "I can accept it organizationally and theoretically, but let's try it first."
    The Youth League members who participated in the Party member meeting, in the Youth League member meeting discussion, implemented the spirit of thinking of ways and overcoming difficulties, and criticized some Youth League members' erroneous thoughts that the masses were backward, difficult to transform, worried about not being able to complete quotas, and not actively uniting the masses.
    After the discussions of the Party and the Youth League, the Party and Youth League members, in the trade union group discussion meetings, studied with the workers and masses. After repeated explanations and mobilizations, the masses' thinking of emphasizing difficulties and unwillingness to implement quotas changed. However, everyone still had no confidence in the quota for raw material usage (54 jin of tobacco leaves for each carton of cigarettes, 415 cigarettes produced per paper roll) and the quota for steaming tobacco of 500 jin per hour. In order to completely dispel the workers' concerns, the branch combined with the administration to conduct actual experiments (using 540 jin of tobacco leaves and one paper roll for the raw material usage standard experiment). As a result, 540 jin of tobacco leaves produced 10 cartons and 49 boxes of cigarettes, and one paper roll produced 416 cigarettes, all exceeding the original standards, laying the foundation for the workers' confidence in exceeding the quota. However, some individual workers believed that this was a temporary experiment, and it would still be difficult to maintain it for a long time.
    In order to further lay the foundation for the comprehensive implementation of quota management, the factory adopted a key experiment method, in order to strengthen the workers' confidence and completely resolve ideological concerns. The factory selected the steaming group, cigarette rolling machine No. 1, and packaging group No. 5, which are the central links in the production process and can represent the general situation, as key groups to continue the experiment. During the first day of the trial implementation in the steaming group, although everyone worked very hard and was sweating profusely, the result was only 455 jin steamed per hour. The morale of the masses was very low, and they had no confidence in completing 500 jin steamed per hour. Some said: "See, the standard is still high!" The branch secretary discussed with the Party member workers to study the reasons for not completing the task. As a result, three shortcomings were analyzed: the fire stoker did not watch and add fuel diligently, wasting time and fuel; there was no scientific division of labor and responsibility, forming a chaotic grabbing phenomenon; the actions were slow and the time was not grasped tightly. After research, everyone decided to divide the labor and be responsible to ensure that the above shortcomings were overcome. And they tried to change each grate from loading 50 jin of tobacco leaves to 40 jin, accelerating the circulation speed of steaming the leaves. On the second day of the trial implementation, it reached 552 jin of steamed leaves per hour, exceeding the original standard by 52 jin. At the same time, the coal consumption reached 81 jin for steaming every thousand jin of leaves, a reduction of 24 jin compared to the original 105 jin. After this fact appeared, the workers had no more ideological concerns. The results of a month's trial implementation showed that 557 jin were steamed per hour, exceeding the original 500 jin of leaves steamed per hour by 11.4%. Coal consumption per thousand jin of tobacco leaves steamed was 95.9 jin, saving 8.6% compared to the original 105 jin.
    Packaging Group No. 5, due to the active leadership of Party and Youth League members, and mutual assistance with the masses, and specific division of labor, the entire group not only completed but also exceeded the quota standard on average. For example, the original quota was 60 boxes per hour, and the actual average was 62.4 boxes per hour. Cigarette Rolling Machine No. 1 also exceeded the original quota.
    Party members in non-key groups also actively united the masses and worked hard to find standards: under the leadership of Party members Li Xingtai and Bai Fengwen, the workers in the tobacco cutting group carefully studied and experimented on their own, and found that the large tobacco cutting machine cut 276 jin of tobacco leaves and 120 jin of tobacco stems per hour, and the small tobacco cutting machine cut 146 jin per hour. When this standard was submitted to the labor management committee for review and approval, the factory director and technicians not only did not think it was low, but also thought it was high (the highest standard for the small tobacco cutting machine in the three competitions was only 100 jin per hour), and were afraid that the machine's efficiency was not that high. They also personally made calculations and explained various bases, and the leaders also thought it was very appropriate. Li Xingtai and Bai Wenfeng also took the initiative to help the silk drying group and introduced the experience of the group in finding standards, and as a result, they found the standard of drying 450 jin of tobacco silk per hour. Party members in other groups also highly exerted their core role of setting an example, uniting, and leading everyone, dispelling the workers' ideological concerns, and ensuring the victorious success of the experiment and key trial implementation. Calculated only by the excess value of each key trial implementation group, it totals more than 2,180 jin of rice. Especially because of the successful trial implementation, it drove the entire factory. Each group is carefully counting the production of the group to strive for exceeding the quota, completely eliminating and reversing the ideological concerns of not being able to complete the quota and emphasizing difficulties, laying the foundation for confidence in exceeding the quota. Groups that have not tried quota management are automatically requesting to implement quotas. Zhang Xiangzhen (non-Party member), a technician from Vehicle No. 2 who used to emphasize difficulties, said at the conference: "When I started to implement quotas, I always thought the standard was high and could not be completed. After the trial implementation of Vehicle No. 1, I am not afraid. I also dare to guarantee to complete and exceed the quota. I now understand that as long as we all take action, all difficulties can be overcome!" In this way, a solid foundation was laid for the comprehensive development of quotas. Now, criticism and self-criticism are being further carried out within the Party to review and overcome shortcomings, and to prepare to closely unite the masses and play a greater role in the comprehensive implementation of quota management.

　　石家庄风行纸烟厂支部
    保证试行定额管理
    孙志伟  马文满
    石家庄风行烟厂支部，在实行定额管理中发挥了保证与监督作用，使定额工作顺利展开。烟厂布置实行定额管理后，在酝酿讨论中，支部发现职工中存在着四种思想顾虑：（一）害怕定额，认为定额后不如过去自由，怕完不成任务受罚。（二）愿意实行定额，但标准要比三次竞赛低些，以便易于超额得奖。（三）强调机器老旧、设备不完善等客观困难，认为不能实行定额。（四）不发表意见，大家怎么办就怎么办，消极观望。党员中也存在有类似的思想，对实行定额管理有疑虑。支部为解除职工思想顾虑，扫清各种障碍，决定首先解决党员中怕困难、无信心、消极被动的思想，再通过团带动全体职工打通思想。支部当即召开了全体党员大会，并吸收青年团的积极分子参加。在讨论中，许多党员提出了克服困难的办法和有利条件，批驳与扭转了强调困难，落于群众之后的错误思想。如四号车徒工张永泽（候补党员）提出：“机器旧，设备不完善，不能实行定额”。包装室女工高淑霞（候补党员）说：“我们要克服困难，不应强调困难，同时，我们的定额标准，不是过高，而是根据现有基础来定的，定额是能够实行的。”有的党员认为自己工资低，定额标准也要低。有人便说明党员应起模范带头作用，如果自己首先定得低，将会影响群众强调困难，信心不足。在这次讨论中并启发了一部分党团员，认识了团结群众的重要。例如包装室女团员田金爱提出问题说：“实行定额后某些工人将盒皮、里纸丢了或废了偷别人的怎么办？”团员杜秀云认为应把团员分到各组进行监视。大家都认为这是轻视群众、脱离群众的错误办法。主张很好的团结教育群众。在讨论中大家明确了今后不但党员自己要多想办法，完成和超过定额，更要宣传动员，团结带动群众搞定额。对于实行定额管理，党员思想上取得了一致认识，但，对每时蒸叶五百斤的标准，仍存顾虑。工会主任李立均（行政上是蒸叶组长）在散会后写了一个条子：“我在组织上、理论上都能接受，但还是试试再说吧。”
    参加了党员大会的团员，在团员大会讨论中，贯彻了想办法、克服困难的精神，批评了团员中某些认为群众落后，不好改造，顾虑完不成定额、不积极团结群众的错误思想。
    经过党、团的讨论，党、团员在工会小组讨论会上，同职工群众一起研究，经过再三的解释、动员，群众中强调困难不愿实行定额的思想转变了。但大家对原材料使用定额（每一箱烟用五十四斤烟叶，每盘纸产四一五条烟）及蒸烟量定额每时蒸五百斤仍无信心。为了彻底解除职工顾虑，支部结合行政进行实际试验（用五四○斤烟叶、一个盘纸进行原材料使用标准试验），结果，五四○斤烟叶产烟十箱零四十九盒，一个盘纸产四一六条，均超过原定标准，奠定了职工定额超额信心。但有个别工人认为这是临时试验，长期保持仍有困难。
    为进一步给全面实行定额管理打下基础，该厂采取重点试验办法，以便坚定职工信心，彻底解决思想顾虑。厂方选择生产过程中心环节及能代表一般的蒸叶组、卷烟一号车、包装第五组为重点小组，继续进行试验。蒸叶组第一天试行中，虽然大家都挺卖劲、累得满头大汗，但结果每时只蒸到四五五斤。群众情绪非常低落，对完成每时蒸五百斤更无信心。有的说：“看，还是标准高吧！”支部书记便与党员工人一起商量，研究没有完成的原因。结果分析出三个缺点：烧火的没有勤看勤添，浪费了时间及燃料；没有科学的分工负责，形成乱抓现象；动作慢，时间抓的不紧。经过研究，大家确定分工负责，保证克服以上缺点。并想办法将每篦装五十斤烟叶改为四十斤，加速了蒸叶的循环速度。第二天试行，即达每时蒸叶五五二斤，超过原定标准五二斤，同时，煤耗量达到蒸每千斤叶用八十一斤，较原定一百零五斤减少二十四斤。这一事实出现后职工思想顾虑再也没有了。一个月的试行结果，每时蒸五百五十七斤，较原定每时蒸叶五百斤，超过百分之十一点四。蒸每千斤烟叶耗煤九五点九斤。较原定一百零五斤，节省百分之八点六。
    包装第五组，由于党、团员的积极带头，并与群众互相帮助，具体分工，全组平均不仅完成并超过了定额标准。如：原定每时六十盒，实际平均每时六二·四盒·一号卷烟车同样也超过了原定额。
    非重点小组的党员，也积极团结群众努力找标准：切烟组的工友在党员李兴泰、白风文二同志带动下，精心钻研，自行试验，找出了大切烟机每时切烟叶二七六斤，切烟筋一二○斤，小切烟机每时切一四六斤的定量标准。当这个标准交到工管会审核批准时，厂长和技师不仅认为不低，而且认为高了（小切烟机三次竞赛最高标准每时仅为一百斤），怕机器效能没有那么高。他们又亲自作了计算，说明各种根据后，领导方面也认为这是很适当的。李兴泰和白文风，还主动的帮助烘丝组，介绍了本组找标准的过程经验，结果找出每时烘四五○斤烟丝的标准。其他各组党员也都高度发挥了以身作则、团结、带动大家的核心作用，解除了职工思想顾虑，保证了实验与重点试行的胜利成功。仅以各重点试行小组超额价值计算，共折米二、一八○斤以上。特别是由于试行成功，带动了全厂，各组都在精心的统计本组生产情况，争取超额，彻底消除与扭转了完不成定额、强调困难等思想顾虑，奠定了超额信心。各个没有试行定额的小组，都自动的要求实行定额。以往强调困难的二号车技工张相震（非党员）在大会上说：“开始实行定额时，我总认为标准高，完不成，经过一号车的试行我不怕了，我也敢保证完成并超过定额。我现在明白了，只要我们大家都行动起来，一切困难都能克服！”就这样，奠定了全面展开定额的巩固基础。现在党内正进一步展开批评与自我批评，检讨、克服缺点，准备在全面实行定额管理中，密切团结群众，发挥更多更大的作用。
