　　Capital Cinema to Open Today
　　The Guomin Grand Theater, directly under the North China Film Management Company of the Central Film Bureau, has been renovated and renamed the Capital Cinema. It is scheduled to open today, June 14, and will open for business on the 15th. The New China Cinema and the Dahua Cinema have also completed their renovations and will open today.
　　The renovated cinemas all sell tickets in advance, with assigned seating. Preferential treatment has been established: 20% discount for individuals with identification and military/police in uniform, and a 40% discount for groups of 20 or more. As for the audience, it is required that no snacks (with peels or pits), no smoking, no loud talking, and no bringing young children into the venue.
　　Beijing Post Office to Purchase Books on Behalf of Customers
　　To facilitate book purchases for readers, the Beijing Post Office has signed contracts with nine major publishing institutions, including Xinhua Bookstore, Sanlian Bookstore, Joint Publishing, International Bookstore, Commercial Press Beijing Branch, Zhonghua Book Company Beijing Branch, China Youth Publishing House, Kaiming Bookstore, and Fuxing Cartography Society, to purchase books on their behalf. Readers in all regions (currently limited to the Beijing postal area, i.e., the areas along the Jinghan, Jinggu, and Jingsui lines, south to Handan and Cixian, and northwest including the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan) who wish to purchase any books, whether domestic or foreign editions, from the above bookstores, may entrust the local post office to purchase them on their behalf. The book price is the same as a direct purchase; this saves the trouble of writing letters and remitting money, and the post office only charges one-tenth of the book price as postage. For organizations, schools, factories, or the public making bulk orders (ten or more copies), a 5% discount is offered. All post offices in this postal area have book catalogs available for readers to consult at any time. (Social Service Division, Beijing Post Office)
