　　Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Telegraph Department
    Achieves Remarkable Results in Eliminating Errors
    Issues Friendly Challenge to Eight Bureaus Including Shanghai
    [This newspaper reports] The Beijing Telecommunications Bureau's telegraph department launched an error elimination competition on April 15th and has already achieved considerable results. Prior to the competition, according to statistics from April 1st to April 14th, there were twelve major outgoing errors. After the competition was launched, from April 15th to April 30th, major outgoing errors decreased to six; from May 1st to May 15th, major errors decreased to one. Among them, the A Team Broadcasting Group (Guan Honglin Group) has achieved complete elimination of all errors, both major and minor. The fifth team of the A Team Processing Area and Delivery Area has achieved complete elimination of major errors. Twenty-three employees have been commended for discovering and eliminating major errors.

    During the error elimination competition, employees also issued friendly challenges to eight bureaus, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Chengde, Jinan, and Shijiazhuang, which received enthusiastic responses from the other parties. From May 1st, the bureau officially entered into a cooperative competition with Shanghai operators. According to statistics from the fifteen days after the competition, only fifty-four errors occurred, accounting for 0.88% of the total transmissions. In the past, a single night shift often required dozens of queries. During the competition, employees in Beijing and Shanghai were able to further exchange experiences and offer mutual criticism and encouragement.

    The A Team Broadcasting Group in the express delivery area was able to completely eliminate all errors, both major and minor, for many reasons. The group members achieved reasonable division of labor, leveraging each person's strengths. Everyone learned from each other, improving their skills. Close cooperation between the group and comrades in the Central Office was also an important reason for their success.

    The efforts of the telegraph department alone cannot completely eliminate errors. During this competition, the Central Office worked hard to refresh the machinery, providing the telegraph department with a good material guarantee. The business department also launched an error elimination campaign, and the general affairs office initiated a cleaning campaign.

    Through this competition, employees' work attitude has improved. A letter from the Jinan Bureau stated: "Your work attitude is amiable and serious, you always try to solve problems when you encounter difficulties, and you never lose your temper on the machine. These are worthy of our learning and emulation."

    The delivery personnel have already broken the original administrative standard of three minutes per mile. Now, the slowest time per mile is only 2.6 minutes. Fifty-seven percent of the people have reached the standard of "aiming for two minutes per mile" proposed by the competition committee. Comrades Wang Changjiang and Shi Guicai implemented the four-check method and received the red flag twice in a row, without producing a single error.

    The competition has promoted business learning. After the competition began, everyone moved from enthusiastic challenges and planning to extensive research of business operations. Employees used fifteen minutes after work to hold informal meetings to discuss how to eliminate errors. During this stage, many practical business learning methods were discovered, improving upon the past simple business learning.

    The shortcomings in this phase of work are: some comrades on the manual machines in the bureau have irregular sending techniques; some people copy reports without confidence, looking left and right, and dare not let go, which affects speed; and there is still a backlog of incoming reports. These are all areas that should be addressed and overcome in the future.

    During this phase, the bureau created more than a dozen methods for eliminating errors. Comrade Li Duan truly achieved listening to one character and typing one character, checking as he copies. Sun Jiarui created a set of report-posting methods that have been implemented throughout the bureau, with excellent efficiency. Squad leader Min Cunzhang used a buzzer to correct irregular techniques of operators.

    In order to completely eliminate errors, the bureau's competition committee proposed the slogan for the second stage: "Be careful and responsible, improve methods, completely eliminate major errors, and reduce minor errors." It also plans to strengthen contact with telegraph workers from bureaus across the country and further use the power of cooperation and mutual assistance to eliminate errors in telegrams.

### 北京电信局报务科  消灭差错成绩显著  向上海等八局提出友谊挑战

　　北京电信局报务科
    消灭差错成绩显著
    向上海等八局提出友谊挑战
    【本报讯】北京电信局报务科于四月十五日展开消灭差错竞赛，现已获得不小成绩。竞赛以前，据四月一日到四月十四日的统计，出局的大差错有十二件。展开竞赛以后，四月十五日到四月三十日，出局的大差错减少到六件，五月一日到五月十五日，大差错减少到一件；其中，Ａ班广播组（关鸿霖组），已做到大小差错全部消灭。Ａ班处理区及投递区的第五班，已做到全部消灭大差错。有二十三人因发现并消灭了大差错，受到表扬。
    在消灭差错竞赛中，职工们并先后向上海、南京、重庆、天津、西安、承德、济南、石家庄等八个局提出友谊挑战，获得对方热烈响应。从五月一日起，该局与上海值机员正式进入合作竞赛。据竞赛以后十五天的统计仅发生五十四件差错，占总次数的百分之零点八八。在过去，一个夜班机就常常查询数十次。北京、上海两地职工在竞赛中，并能进一步交流经验，互相批评与鼓励。
    快机区Ａ班广播组能全部消灭大小差错，原因很多。该组组员作到合理分工，发挥了每个人的长处。大家互相学习，提高了技术。该组与中央室的同志取得密切合作，也是获得成绩的重要原因之一。
    单只报务科努力，也不可能完全消灭差错。在这次竞赛中，中央室努力刷新机械，给了报务科很好的物质保证。营业科也展开了消灭差错运动，庶务室也发起了清洁运动。
    通过此次竞赛，职工的劳动态度改进了。济南局来信说：“你们的工作态度和蔼、认真，遇到困难总是设法解决，在机上从来不发火，这些是值得我们学习和效仿的。”
    送报员已经打破了原来行政上制订的每里路三分钟的标准。现在最慢的每里路也只需二·六分钟。有百分之五十七的人已达到了竞赛委员会提出的“向两分钟一里地看齐”的标准。王长江、史贵才两位同志按照四看办法执行，连续得到两次红旗，没有产生一件差错。
    竞赛推动了业务学习。竞赛开始以后，大家由热烈的挑战、订计划，进入广泛地研究业务。职工们利用下班后的十五分钟开碰头会，讨论如何消灭差错。在这一阶段，发现了许多切合实际的业务学习办法，把过去单纯的业务学习，提高了一步。
    在这一段工作中的缺点是：该局人工机上一部分同志发报手法不正规；也有人抄了报没有信心，左看右看，不敢放手，影响了迅速；来报处仍有积报现象。这些都是今后应该注意克服的。
    在这一阶段中，该局共创造了十数种消灭差错的办法。李端同志切实做到了听一字打一字、随抄报随检查。孙家瑞创造了一套贴报的办法，已在全局实行，效率很好。闵存璋班长利用蜂鸣器，改进了值机员不正规的手法。
    为了彻底消灭差错，该局竞赛委员会提出第二阶段的口号是：“细心负责、改进方法，彻底消灭大差错，减少小差错”。并准备加强与全国各局报务工作者的联系，进一步用合作互助的力量，来消灭电报上的差错。
