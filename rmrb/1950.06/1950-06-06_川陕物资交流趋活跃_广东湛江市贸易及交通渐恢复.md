　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 4th. Under the promotion of the state-owned Western Sichuan Trading Company, the material exchange between Western Sichuan and Shaanxi is becoming increasingly active. In the past five months, state-owned and private commercial organizations in Western Sichuan have shipped 1 million jin of sugar to the Northwest. For medicinal materials, the volume reached 15 tons in March and April alone. The Western Sichuan Trading Company shipped out over 19,300 reams of Lian Shi paper and transported back over 89,900 jin of cotton and 547 barrels of gasoline. The exchange of these materials has played a certain role in meeting the needs of the people in Western Sichuan and the Northwest for production and livelihood.
　　Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Sichuan native products such as sugar, paper, and medicinal materials were sold far and wide in the Northwest provinces. In the early days of liberation, private merchants in the Northwest and Western Sichuan mostly held a wait-and-see attitude, and were also unable to transport goods over long distances due to limited funds. For a time, various Sichuan native products experienced sluggish sales. For example, a large amount of sugar gathered in Chengdu only sold a few thousand jin per day, and many paper-making households in the Jiajiang paper-producing area were also closed down due to lack of sales channels. In response to the above situation, the Western Sichuan Trading Company began to purchase large quantities of sugar and paper and other local products in mid-January of this year and transported them to the Northwest. This move was welcomed by the people of the Northwest and also encouraged the trading enthusiasm of private merchants. In mid-February, private merchants began to sell local products to the Northwest, and since then, the volume of transportation has increased month by month. According to statistics from the Chengdu Main Station of the Northwest Highway Administration, the number of public and private trucks and buses on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway was 441 in February, which increased to 611 in April. In May alone, private merchants sold 500,000 jin of sugar, mostly transported to the Lanzhou area, with a net profit of 300,000 yuan per dan of sugar (100 jin). Local product companies in various parts of the Northwest also came to Chengdu to purchase goods. In May, the local product companies purchased 20 tons of medicinal materials and 400 dan of tea, preparing to transport them to the Northwest and South China. Recently, cargo trucks have been coming and going on the Sichuan-Shaanxi road in an endless stream.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th. Since the Kuomintang bandit gangs' sea and air harassment in the South China region has been basically eliminated after the liberation of Hainan Island, coupled with the emergence of national price stability, trade and transportation in Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province, the second largest city in Guangdong with a population of over 200,000, are gradually recovering. Up to now, more than 80% of the shops in the city that had closed before and after liberation have resumed business. In Chikan alone, 32 new businesses have been added. The number of textile enterprises in operation is more than four times that of the early days of liberation. The production of matches has increased by nearly two times compared with the early days of liberation. Other industries such as soap, leather making, glass, and firecrackers are also preparing to resume business. Highway transportation is smooth, with more than 260 vehicles traveling on various public roads with Zhanjiang as the starting point or ending point. In terms of waterways, ships regularly travel between Mei Lu, Haikang, Xuwen, and Haikou. Shipping between the city and Hong Kong has also resumed. At present, the Zhanjiang Municipal People's Government and state-owned trading institutions are taking effective measures to support legitimate industry and commerce; workers in various industries are also voluntarily temporarily reducing their wages to help industrialists and businessmen overcome temporary difficulties.

　　川陕物资交流趋活跃
    广东湛江市贸易及交通渐恢复
    【新华社重庆四日电】在国营川西贸易公司的推动下，川西和陕西间的物资交流日趋活跃。五个月来，由川西各公私商业机关运销西北的食糖达一百万斤，药材仅三、四两月份已达十五吨，川西贸易公司运出连史纸一万九千三百余刀，运回棉花八万九千九百余斤和汽油五百四十七桶。这些物资的交流，对解决川西和西北两地人民生产及生活资料的需要，起了一定的作用。
    抗战前，四川土产如糖、纸张和药材等远销西北各省。解放初期，西北及川西两地私商多存观望心理，同时也由于资金的限制而无力远道贩运，四川各种土产曾一度出现滞销现象。如聚集在成都的大量食糖，每日仅成交数千斤，夹江产纸区亦因没有销路，不少制纸户歇业。针对上述情况，川西贸易公司自本年一月中旬起即开始大量收购糖和纸等土产品，向西北区运销。此举备受西北人民的欢迎，同时也鼓励了私商的贩运情绪。二月中旬，私商开始贩卖土产品到西北，自此以后，贩运数量逐月增加。据西北区公路管理局成都总站统计，川陕公路公私货车和客车二月份为四百四十一辆，四月份增为六百十一辆，五月份仅私商即销出食糖五十万斤，大部运往兰州一带，一担糖（一百斤）能净赚三十万元。西北各地土产公司亦纷纷来蓉采购，五月份各土产公司即收购药材二十吨和茶叶四百担，准备运销西北与华南各地。最近川陕路上来往货车络绎不绝。
    【新华社广州四日电】由于海南岛解放后国民党匪帮在华南一带的海、空骚扰已在基本上被消除，加以全国物价稳定的条件已经出现，拥有二十余万人口的广东的第二大城市湛江市的贸易、交通正在逐步恢复中。迄目前止，该市在解放前后停业的商店已有百分之八十以上复业，赤坎一地即新增商号三十二家，纺织业开工户数为解放初期的四倍以上，火柴生产量比解放初期增加近两倍，其他肥皂、制革、玻璃和爆竹等行业亦纷纷准备复业。公路交通畅达，以湛江为起点或终点的行走各公路线上的汽车共达二百六十余辆。水路方面经常有船只来往于梅菉、海康、徐闻和海口之间。该市至香港间的航运亦已复通。目前，湛江市人民政府及国营贸易机构正采取有效措施扶植正当的工商业；各业工人亦主动暂时降低工资，帮助工商业家度过暂时困难。
