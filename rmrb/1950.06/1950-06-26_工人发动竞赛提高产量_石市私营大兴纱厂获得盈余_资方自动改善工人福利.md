Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: In Shijiazhuang City, the private Daxing Cotton Mill has greatly increased its yarn and cloth production and saved raw materials due to workers launching a production competition, and has now achieved a surplus. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the factory was managed by the People's Government due to the absconding of the person in charge, and was returned in April of last year. Upon its return, the factory's trade union jointly signed a labor-capital agreement with Daxing Company, thus enabling the company to maintain various democratic systems of worker participation in production management from the past, while the trade union conducted labor discipline education among the workers. In March of this year, under the advocacy of the factory's trade union, Communist Party, and Communist Youth League branches, the workers launched a "Production Month" campaign. As a result of this movement, the average unit output of 20-count yarn (24 hours) increased to 1.043 pounds, the average output of fine cloth per loom increased by one-seventh, the raw cotton used was 6,364 pounds less than the average for the previous four months, the cotton yarn used was 129 pounds less, and the waste cloth rate was reduced from 6.5% to 2.5%. Significant savings were also achieved in various oils, steel wire rings, and other materials. Production in April also increased compared to March. In May, after consultation between labor and capital, it was decided to launch a "Red May" production competition based on the principle of "more work, more pay." The factory's trade union, Communist Party, and Communist Youth League branches played a role in promoting and guaranteeing this. During the competition, competition committees were established throughout the factory and in each department and workshop, and everyone set out plans and guarantees. As a result of the competition, the average unit output of 20-count yarn in that month further increased to 1.097 pounds, and the average output of fine cloth per loom was 90.56 yards, an increase of 80% compared to April of last year. Workers Xie Baozhu and Zhao Sheng wove more than 35 yards of fine cloth per shift (8 hours), creating an unprecedented record for the Daxing Cotton Mill.

The factory's production is for state processing, and there are no problems with raw materials or sales. In February of this year, the North China Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation, in order to take care of the factory's relatively old machinery and equipment, also appropriately adjusted the ratio of raw cotton to yarn and cloth exchange; coupled with the workers launching the production competition, increasing output, and saving raw materials, the cost was greatly reduced, and the factory thus obtained a surplus. In view of the workers' active production, the factory's capitalists also automatically improved worker welfare. After the "Production Month" in March, the factory's capitalists rewarded labor models with 45,000 catties of millet and gave each person an umbrella. In addition, doctors were hired to treat workers. Since May, preliminary improvements have also been made in the factory's safety and hygiene. For example, a fire-fighting storage was built near the cotton cleaning department, spittoons were placed in each workshop, and all workers were issued masks and covered tea bowls. The factory is also preparing to increase worker cultural and recreational facilities.

Due to increased confidence in capital operations, in addition to the original looms being fully operational, another 90 are being actively renovated. The factory has also decided to transport and install 10,000 spindles that were stored in Hankou.

　　工人发动竞赛提高产量
    石市私营大兴纱厂获得盈余
    资方自动改善工人福利
    【新华社二十三日讯】石家庄市私营大兴纱厂由于工人发动了生产竞赛，大大提高了纱、布产量，节省了原料，业已获得盈余。该厂在石家庄市解放后，因负责人逃匿，曾由人民政府代管，于去年四月发还。发还时，该厂工会曾与大兴公司方面共同签订了劳资议定书，因而使公司方面保持了过去工人参加生产管理的各种民主制度，工会方面则在工人中进行了劳动纪律的教育。今年三月，该厂工人在工会、共产党和青年团支部倡导下，开展了“生产月”运动。这一运动的结果，二十支纱单位产量（二十四小时）平均提高到一点零四三磅，细布每台织机产量平均提高了七分之一，所用原棉较以前四个月平均数节省了六千三百六十四磅，所用棉纱节省了一百二十九磅，次布率由百分之六点五减到百分之二点五。其他各种油类、钢丝圈等材料也节省了不少。四月份生产比三月份亦有上升。至五月份，劳资双方经过协商，确定以“多劳多得”为原则，发动“红五月”生产竞赛。该厂工会、共产党和青年团的支部则从中推动保证。竞赛中，全厂和各部、各车间都成立了竞赛委员会，每个人都订出计划和保证条件。竞赛结果，该月二十支纱单位产量平均即再提高到一点零九七磅，细布每台平均出九十点五六码，比去年四月增加百分之八十。工人谢宝柱、赵生每班（八小时）织细布三十五码多，创造了大兴纱厂前所未有的纪录。
    该厂生产系为国家加工、原料、销路均无问题。今年二月，中国花纱布公司华北区公司为照顾该厂机器设备较为老旧的情况，又适当地调整了原棉和纱、布交换的比例；加以工人发动生产竞赛，提高了产量，节约了原材料，因而成本大为减低，该厂亦因而获得了盈余。该厂资方鉴于工人积极生产，亦自动改善工人福利。在三月份“生产月”之后，该厂资方以四万五千斤小米奖励劳动模范，并奖给每人一把雨伞，另外还聘请了医生为工人治病。至五月以后，该厂安全卫生方面亦有了初步改进。如在清花部附近建筑了消防库，各车间都安置了痰盂，给全厂工人发了口罩和带盖的茶碗。厂方并准备增加工人文化娱乐的设备。
    由于资方经营信心提高，该厂除原有织布机已全部开齐外，另有九十台正被积极装修中。厂方并决将定存放在汉口的一万枚锭子运回安装。
