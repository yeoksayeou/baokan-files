　　Eradicating Bureaucratic Work Style to Eliminate Corruption and Waste
    The People's Supervision Committee's circular regarding the investigation and handling of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's water tower project's corruption and waste case is a heavy blow to bureaucrats and corrupt elements.

    As the circular pointed out, the root cause of this case lies in the serious bureaucratic work style of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's leadership. These bureaucrats were afraid of taking responsibility, afraid of trouble, and afraid of offending people, but not afraid of the loss of state and people's property. Wanting to complete the task quickly to avoid losses from price fluctuations of construction funds is correct; but as a result, they did not review and study the project's bid price and blindly stamped their approval. Thus, corruption and waste were approved by bureaucracy.

    In the past year or more, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has achieved results in repairing lines, supporting the army's southward advance, reorganizing stations, and clearing blockages. However, because the leadership's work style has not been improved, the existing achievements are extremely unstable. Moreover, the phenomenon of carelessness in their work is very serious. For example, the bureau planned to repair 293 bridges before May 10th, but by the end of March, only 70 had been completed, and 172 were under construction, with the amount of work exceeding the first phase target by 11 percent. However, after inspection by the inspection team sent by the Ministry of Railways' Engineering Bureau, it was found that the quality of many projects was not good enough, and the riveting work was very poor. Moreover, the construction plan was drawn up sitting in the office and was often impractical, seriously wasting labor. This proves that the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has not yet learned the lessons of the water tower incident well, and it also shows that the fight against bureaucracy must go through a fairly serious struggle.

    The mistakes made by Zhang Fen, Director of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's Engineering Section, are also worthy of our vigilance. He is not familiar enough with engineering business, but he is not modest either. He does not ask for instructions from superiors before major projects, nor is he willing to investigate and research. He is arrogant, complacent, and self-righteous. Minister Teng Daiyuan pointed out in his article "Eradicating Bureaucratic Work Style in the Railway System": "Some people also say: I am a layman, so things have not been done well. However, if you are a layman, you should work harder and learn business more humbly." Zhang Fen is a layman who is unwilling to learn. He is undisciplined and unorganized towards his superiors, but he adopts a bureaucratic work style towards his subordinates. Some bureaucrats are fond of playing with paperwork, but he goes to the other extreme, handing over official documents and stamps to others and ignoring everything.

    Bureaucracy is the breeding ground for all corrupt elements. For the benefit of the people and for the future of the country, we must resolutely implement Article 18 of the Common Program, which states: "All state organs of the People's Republic of China must practice a clean, simple, and people-serving revolutionary work style, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose the bureaucratic work style of being divorced from the masses of the people." This is a serious struggle; Minister Teng Daiyuan pointed out that in the railway system, "the first thing is to organize more than 400,000 railway employees to participate in this struggle." Throughout the country, the broad masses of the working people must also participate in this struggle. Because the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has done a very poor job in mobilizing workers and democratizing management, the workers' consciousness has not been raised to the necessary level, the enthusiasm of the employees has not been fully developed, and the unity is not good enough, so that bad elements have an opportunity to take advantage of it, and the corruption case has not been discovered for a long time. And the exposure of the incident still relied on the workers. Because the contractor purchased the steel bars needed to repair the water tower in Shanghai, manipulating the market, the price of steel bars soared, and the Shanghai construction workers reported this situation to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, which led to the initial exposure of the incident. This shows that we must rely on the broad masses of the people, especially the workers and peasants, to eliminate the bureaucratic work style.

### 铲除官僚主义作风  才能杜绝贪污浪费

　　铲除官僚主义作风  才能杜绝贪污浪费
    人民监察委员会所发表的关于查办郑州铁路管理局水塔工程贪污浪费案件的通报，是对于官僚主义者和贪污腐化分子的一个沉重打击。
    正如通报所指出的，这个案件发生的根本原因，是郑州路局领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风。这些官僚主义者，怕负责任，怕麻烦，怕得罪人，却不怕国家人民的财产遭受损失。想快点完成任务，不使工款受物价波动的损失，这是对的；但却因此而对工程标价不加审核研究，糊里糊涂盖章批准。于是，贪污浪费就为官僚主义所批准了。
    郑州路局一年多以来，在抢修线路、支援大军南下、整理车站、清理堵塞等方面是有成绩的。但由于领导作风未曾改善，已有的成绩也是极不巩固的。而且他们在工作中粗枝大叶的现象十分严重。如该路局计划于五月十日以前修复的二百九十三座桥梁，截至三月底就已全部完成七十座，正施工的有一百七十二座，工量共超过第一期任务的百分之十一。但经铁道部工程总局派出的检查小组检查的结果，发现许多工程质量不够好，铆钉工作很坏。而且，施工计划是坐在办公室订的，常常不合实际，严重浪费劳动力。这证明郑州路局仍然没有很好地接受水塔事件的教训，也说明反官僚主义还须经过相当严重的斗争。
    郑州路局工务处长章奋所犯的错误，也值得我们警惕。他对工程业务不够熟悉，但却又不虚心，重大工程事前不请示上级，也不肯调查研究。骄傲自满，自以为是。滕代远部长在“铲除铁路系统中官僚主义作风”一文中曾指出：“也有人说：我是外行，因此事情没办好。但是，如果是外行，就应该更努力更虚心学习业务。”章奋就是外行而又不肯学习的人。对上级无组织无纪律，对下级则是一套官僚主义作风。有些官僚主义者是玩弄文牍者，他则走到另一极端，把公文、手章交给别人，一律不闻不问。
    官僚主义是一切贪污腐化者寄生的母体。为了人民的利益，为了国家的前途，我们要坚决执行共同纲领第十八条的规定，即：“中华人民共和国的一切国家机关，必须厉行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。”这是一个严重的斗争；滕代远部长指出，在铁路系统中，“首先是要组织四十多万铁路员工来参加这一斗争”。在全国各地，同样要广大劳动人民参加这一斗争。郑州路局因为在发动工人及管理民主化方面做得很差，工人觉悟未能提高到应有的程度，职工积极性未能充分发扬，团结也不够好，才使坏分子有机可乘，才使贪污案发生很久未被发觉。而事件的揭发，则还是依靠工人。由于包商在上海购买修水塔所需的钢筋，操纵市场，钢筋价格骤涨，上海建筑工人把这情况反映到政务院财经委员会，才使事件开始暴露。这说明了我们必须依靠广大人民特别是工农群众，才能消灭官僚主义作风。
