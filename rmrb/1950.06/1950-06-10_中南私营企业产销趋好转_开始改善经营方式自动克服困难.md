　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 8th: Private industrial and commercial enterprises in the Central and Southern China region have begun to see improvements in production and business under the support of state-owned trading companies. Generally, private industrial and commercial operators have begun to change their business methods and automatically overcome current temporary difficulties.

　　From March to May, the Central and Southern China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company entrusted the No. 1 Cotton Mill in Wuhan to spin 18,400 bales of cotton yarn, weave 100,002 bolts of 12-pound white shirting, and entrusted the Donghua Printing and Dyeing Factory to dye 5,000 bolts of gray cloth. It also allocated 1,500 dan of raw cotton to the Shenxin and Yuhua factories; in Jiangxi Province, it allocated a total of 5,000 dan of raw cotton to the Xingzhong Yarn Factory in Jiujiang City and the Xinsheng Yarn Factory in Nanchang City for entrusted processing, and entrusted the Xingzhong Yarn Factory to spin 900 bales of 20-count yarn; in Henan Province, it entrusted the Xin’yi Yarn Factory in Zhengzhou to spin 600 bales of 20-count yarn, and allocated more than 12,000 jin of raw cotton to the Tiantong Yarn Factory to support its continued production; in Guangdong Province, it is entrusting various private dyeing and weaving factories to dye 5,809 bolts of various colored cloth and process 1,333 bolts of high-quality fine bamboo yarn and 200 mosquito nets. In addition, the company purchased 4,438 bales of cotton yarn and 11,339 bolts of various cloths from textile factories in Wuhan, Changsha, Nanchang, and Guangzhou at market prices, and released large amounts of capital to the factories. Among them, the purchase of 600 bales of 20-count yarn from Yuhua Yarn Factory alone injected 3.33 billion yuan. In the middle and late May, the company purchased 245 bales of yarn from the Xingzhong Yarn Factory in Jiujiang City, accounting for more than 60% of the factory's actual output in those two weeks.

　　From April 25th to May 20th, the Henan Provincial Company of the China Department Store invested a total of 1,179,420,000 yuan in Kaifeng City to order, purchase, or entrust processing to industries such as leather, soap, stationery, knitwear, and matches, which resulted in more than 20 leather businesses gradually improving from a state of semi-shutdown. From mid-April to mid-May, the Jiangxi Provincial Department Store purchased 850 million yuan worth of goods from more than 40 manufacturers in Nanchang City alone. Other measures, such as the Salt Company entrusting private merchants to sell salt, the Egg Products Company purchasing eggs, and the Coal Company purchasing coal, are also being carried out separately in various regions.

　　In order to ensure that state-owned trading companies and private businesses have an appropriate division of labor in their business operations, state-owned retail companies in various regions have changed the past shortcomings of indistinguishable retail and wholesale prices or very small differences. Now wholesalers can obtain a certain profit.

　　The above measures have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of private industrial and commercial operators, gradually dispelled their various concerns, and private industrial and commercial operators have generally begun to actively change their business methods and automatically overcome various difficulties. For example, the private Baotai Flour Mill in Wuhan City is now modifying ten flour milling machines to six, which can increase the daily production of flour by 200 bags, and reduce electricity consumption by one-third. The original power department of the No. 1 Yarn Factory has changed from burning two boilers with one turbine to burning only one boiler, which can save more than four tons of coal per day; the Yuhua Yarn Factory has also formulated plans related to enterprise management and product standardization. In terms of commerce, twenty cotton firms in Wuhan City, such as Weisheng and Dacheng, have changed to joint operations to facilitate management and save expenses, and have formulated collective covenants that provide reasonable and detailed regulations on job division, profit and loss sharing, etc. Forty-eight cotton yarn dealers who have always engaged in speculation have also jointly established the Hezhong Supply and Marketing Company, whose business is mainly the transportation and sale of local products. Industries such as grain and hardware are also organizing joint operations. The Dalian Metal Industrial Raw Materials Company, jointly established by seventeen small merchants from the hardware, machinery, second-hand goods, and iron industries, will soon open. In view of the sluggish leather business in the short term, Hengchang Leather Goods Bureau has stopped operating and is temporarily engaged in bone meal, and is also preparing to set up a bone meal factory at the same time.

　　The number of industrial and commercial households who have suspended or closed down has also generally decreased in various regions. For example, the two cloth shops, Hecheng and Xiehe, which were originally planning to close down in Wuchang City, and Wang Yitai and Dingda in the oil pressing industry, are determined to continue operating. More than ten businesses that have already closed down, such as the Tongxingsheng and Lisenji cigarette businesses, and the Chenxiangsheng and Huachang department stores, are also preparing to resume business.

　　中南私营企业产销趋好转
    开始改善经营方式自动克服困难
    【新华社汉口八日电】中南区各地私营工商业在国营贸易公司的扶植下，生产和营业情况已开始好转。一般私营工商业者都开始改变经营方法，自动克服目前暂时困难。
    中南区花纱布公司自三月份起到五月份止，在武汉市委托第一纱厂代纺棉纱达一万八千四百件，代织十二磅白细布十万零两千匹，委托东华印染厂加染灰色布五千匹，拨借申新、裕华两厂原棉各一千五百担；在江西省拨给九江市兴中纱厂、南昌市新甡纱厂原棉共五千担，委托加工，并委托兴中纱厂代纺二十支纱九百件；在河南省委托郑州新毅纱厂代纺二十支纱六百件，又拨给天同纱厂一万二千余斤原棉，支持其维持生产；在广东省，正委托各私营染织厂加染各种色布五千八百零九匹，加工代织上等幼竹纱一千三百三十三匹，蚊帐布二百匹。此外，该公司并向武汉、长沙、南昌、广州各地纺织厂按市价收购棉纱四千四百三十八件，各种布匹一万一千三百三十九匹，向各厂放出了大批资金。其中仅收购裕华纱厂的六百件二十支纱即投放资金三十三亿三千万元。五月中、下两旬，该公司在九江市向兴中纱厂收购了二百四十五件纱，占该厂两旬实产量的百分之六十以上。
    中国百货公司河南省公司自四月二十五日到五月二十日止，在开封市共投放资金达十一亿七千九百四十二万元，向皮革、肥皂、文具、针织、火柴等行业订货、收购或委托加工，二十多家皮革业因之由生产半停顿状态而渐趋好转。江西省百货公司自四月中旬到五月中旬，仅在南昌市即向四十余家厂商收购价值八亿五千万元的货品。其他如盐业公司委托私商代销食盐，蛋品公司收购鸡蛋，煤业公司收购煤斤等，亦均在各地分别进行中。
    为了使国营贸易公司与私营商业在业务经营范围内有适当分工，各地国营零售公司均改变了过去零售价与批发价不分或相差很少的缺点，现批发商均可获得一定的利润。
    上述各项措施大大鼓舞了私营工商业者的积极性，逐渐打消了他们的各种顾虑，一般私营工商业者都开始积极改变经营方法，自动克服各种困难。如武汉市私营宝泰面粉厂现正将十部制粉机改装为六部，每日可增制面粉二百袋，用电量可减低三分之一。第一纱厂原动部已由开一部透平机烧两个锅炉改为只烧一个锅炉，每日可节省燃煤四吨以上；裕华纱厂亦已制定有关经营企业化、产品标准化的计划。商业方面，武汉市维生、大成等二十家棉花行为便于管理和节省开支，已改为联营，制订了集体公约，对职务分工、损益分摊等都作了合理详细的规定。过去一贯从事投机的四十八家棉纱号，亦已联合成立合众供销公司，其业务以运销土产为主。粮食、五金等业也都在组织联营，由五金、机器、旧货、铁商各业十七家小商户筹设的大联金属工业原料公司，不日即将开业。恒昌皮货局鉴于短期内皮货业务清淡，已停止经营，暂时经营骨粉，并正同时筹设骨粉工厂。
    各地工商业户停、歇业者也已普遍减少，如武昌市原来准备停业的合成、协和两家布店，榨油业的王义太、鼎大都决心继续营业，已停业的香烟业童兴盛、李森记，百货业的陈祥盛、华昌等十多家也正筹备复业中。
