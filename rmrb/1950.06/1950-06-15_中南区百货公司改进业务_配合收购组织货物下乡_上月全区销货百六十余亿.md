    Coordinates Procurement and Organizes Goods for Rural Areas
    Last Month Regional Sales Exceeded 16 Billion
    [Hankou News] According to the Changjiang Daily: The China Department Store Central South China Company and its affiliated departments are actively improving business in accordance with the spirit of adjusting the relationship between industry, commerce, and public-private sectors, in order to promote department store finished products to the vast rural areas, supply the needs of the peasant masses, and revitalize urban and rural trade. The Henan Provincial Company has signed a consignment sales contract with the province's native produce company to organize department store products to go to the countryside in exchange for agricultural products from farmers; at the same time, attention is being paid to expanding the scope of RMB circulation. As a result of actively improving business in May, regional sales reached 16,274,000,000 yuan (Guangzhou's second half of May was not included in the statistics), playing a certain role in helping factories sell their products.
    In assisting private manufacturers and merchants to overcome current difficulties, in addition to continuing to appropriately place orders, process, and purchase goods, in order to rationally adjust market prices to truly serve production and enable legitimate merchants to make a profit, the company has specially designated cadres to investigate and study the production and sales of various goods, and adjust listed prices under the principle of making industry and commerce profitable and obtaining legitimate profits. The Wuhan area is also vigorously developing consignment sales, and has now signed a consignment sales contract with the private Zhenchangxin Glass Store.
