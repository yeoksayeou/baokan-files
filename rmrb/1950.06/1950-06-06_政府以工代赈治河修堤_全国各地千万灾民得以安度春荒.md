　　Government Uses Work Relief to Control Rivers and Repair Dikes
    Nationwide Millions of Disaster Victims Able to Safely Survive the Spring Famine
    [Report from this newspaper] Correspondent Liang Zong reports: Throughout the country, the implementation of work relief in river control and dike repair projects has enabled over ten million disaster victims to successfully overcome the spring famine. Due to the severe floods in many regions last year, serious disasters resulted. In order to ensure long-term national construction and permanently eliminate water disasters, the Central People's Government implemented work relief by controlling rivers and repairing dikes, helping disaster victims to overcome the famine. Seventy-three percent of this year's national water conservancy project funds were allocated to river control and dike repair projects. The main projects being carried out in various regions include: the Chaobai River, the Shu River, the Yi River, the Huai River, the Yellow River flooded area, the Liao River, the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, the Han River, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang seacoast dikes, Dongting Lake, the Pearl River, and the Grand Canal. When mobilizing laborers in various regions, disaster victims are given priority. For example, in Hebei Province, it was originally decided that the People's Liberation Army would participate in the river excavation project, but in order to take care of the living difficulties of the disaster victims, the PLA voluntarily gave up most of the military work; some regions started water conservancy projects early in order to solve the living problems of the disaster victims as soon as possible. Due to the implementation of work relief in river control and dike repair projects, disaster victims in various regions actively participated in the river work. According to statistics from the East China and Central South regions, and Hebei and Pingyuan provinces alone, the number of disaster victims participating in river control and dike repair reached more than 3 million. The wages they earned not only solved their own food problems, but the surplus grain each person had could also support their families. For example, in the Subei Yi River diversion project, the People's Government allocated a total of 185.5 million catties of grain and implemented work relief, which not only solved the food problem of 600,000 disaster victims during their work, but also enabled more than 1 million of their family members to survive the spring famine; in the dike repair in southern Anhui, the lives of 60 percent of the disaster victims along the river were solved; in the spring dike restoration in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in Pingyuan, Shandong, and Henan provinces, more than 125,000 disaster victims were organized to participate, who not only completed the task of controlling the Yellow River, but also earned a lot of grain. According to statistics from Pingyuan Province, the most a laborer could earn was 15 catties of rice per day, and the least was 3.5 catties, with an average of more than 6 catties. Those with a large appetite ate 4 catties of rice per day, and those with a small appetite ate 2 catties of rice per day, with an average of 3 catties of rice per day. Therefore, the remaining grain could support three people. From the above situation, the total value of the wages earned by more than 3 million laborers in river control and dike repair in various regions can enable more than 10 million disaster victims to successfully overcome the spring famine.

　　政府以工代赈治河修堤
    全国各地千万灾民得以安度春荒
    【本报讯】通讯员梁琮报道：全国各地在治河修堤工程中，实行以工代赈，已使一千万以上的灾民顺利度过春荒。由于去年不少地区遭受了水灾，造成严重的灾荒，中央人民政府为了国家长期建设，永除水患，乃实行以工代赈，治河修堤，帮助灾民度过灾荒，从今年全国水利工程事业费中，抽出百分之七十三用于治河修堤工程上。各地进行兴修的主要工程有：潮白河、沭河、沂河、淮河，黄泛区、辽河、黄河、长江、汉水、苏浙海塘、洞庭湖、珠江、运河等。各地区在动员民工时，均以灾民为主。如河北省原来决定由人民解放军参加挖河工程，但为了照顾灾民生活困难，解放军主动让出了大部分军工；有的地区为了及早解决灾民生活问题，将水利工程提前开始。由于在治河修堤工程中施行了以工代赈，各地灾民参加河工的十分踊跃，仅据华东、中南两区和河北、平原两省的统计，参加治河修堤的灾民即达三百余万人，他们所获的工资不仅解决了本身的口粮问题，而每人所余的粮食还能养活家口。如苏北导沂工程中，人民政府共拨发粮食一亿八千五百余万斤，实行以工代赈，除解决了六十万灾民在作工期间的口粮外，并使他们一百余万家属度过了春荒；皖南修堤中，沿江河百分之六十的灾民生活得到解决；黄河下游平原、山东、河南三省在春季复堤中，曾组织了十二万五千余灾民参加，他们不仅完成了治黄任务，而且赚了许多粮食。据平原省统计，民工每人每日最多的能得工资米十五斤，最低的也有三斤半，平均在六斤以上，饭量大的每人每天吃四斤米，饭量小的吃二斤米，平均每人每天吃三斤米，因此，所余粮食可以养活三口人。从上述情况看，各地区在治河修堤中，三百余万民工所获得的工资总值，可使一千万以上的灾民顺利地度过春荒。
