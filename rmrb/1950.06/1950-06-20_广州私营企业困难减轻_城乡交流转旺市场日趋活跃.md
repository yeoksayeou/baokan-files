Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th: The severe difficulties faced by private industry and commerce in Guangzhou have begun to ease, showing signs of improvement. Prices of major commodities in the city fell by an average of about 30 percent from mid-March to late May; after late May, they stabilized, and various abnormal phenomena that occurred during the price decline have been largely reversed, with the market becoming more active. In the first week of June, the volume of transactions for cotton yarn, grain, and industrial raw materials increased significantly compared to the previous period. At the same time, urban-rural material exchange has also become more active than before. Railway freight volume in May increased by 12.6 percent compared to March, and shipping volume increased by 19.6 percent. Private industry and commerce are showing signs of recovery. According to statistics, the number of industrial enterprises applying to open in April was 22, and in May it was 25; the number of commercial enterprises applying to open also increased from 88 in April to 107 in May, with a majority being import and export businesses, textile industries, printing industries, and transportation industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In addition, there are more than 100 enterprises that had previously applied for closure but are now continuing to operate or have changed their business. The beginning of the improvement in the situation of industry and commerce is due to the stabilization of prices and the profitability of legitimate industrialists and merchants, but primarily it is the result of the active assistance provided by state-owned enterprises and government agencies through loans, entrusted processing, purchasing, and consignment sales.

　　广州私营企业困难减轻
    城乡交流转旺市场日趋活跃
    【新华社广州十八日电】广州市私营工商业严重的困难情况已开始减轻，出现了好转的端倪。本市各种主要商品价格自三月中旬开始至五月下旬平均下跌百分之三十左右；五月下旬后转趋稳定，物价下跌期间所曾发生的各种不正常现象也已基本改变，市场转趋活跃。六月初一周间，棉纱粮食和工业原料的成交量均比前大增。同时，城乡物资交流亦较前活跃，五月份铁路货运量比三月份增加百分之十二点六，航运量增加百分之十九点六。私营工商业已呈现复苏。据统计：工业申请开业的，四月份为二十二户，五月份为二十五户；商业申请开业的亦由四月份的八十八户增至五月份的一百零七户，其中以有利于国计民生的进出口业、纺织业、印刷业、运输业为多。此外，过去申请停业而现在继续开业或转业的尚有一百多家。工商业情况的开始好转，除了物价稳定，正当工商业者经营有利等原因以外，主要是国家企业机关对工商业者积极予以贷款、委托加工、收购、代销等扶助的结果。
