Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese House of Councillors election was held on the 4th. The House of Councillors election is being held amidst a sharp escalation of the struggle between American and Japanese reactionary forces and Japanese democrats. American imperialists are stepping up the rearmament of Japan, making Japan a major base for launching military adventures against the Soviet Union and Asian democratic movements. With the help of the Japanese reactionary forces represented by the ruling Liberal Party, American warmongers are attempting to suppress the Japanese democratic movement.

These plans of the American and Japanese reactionary forces have been opposed by the broad masses of the Japanese people. The democratic front, headed by the Japanese Communist Party, put forward the demands for an early conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty in its election slogans, the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces after the restoration of sovereignty in Japan, the prohibition of the construction of military bases in Japan, the unrestricted development of peaceful industries and the democratic rights of the people, and close cooperation with the peace-loving forces in the world.

MacArthur Headquarters and the Japanese government have tried their best to obstruct the election of democratic parties by means of large-scale suppression. Provocation, arrest, defamation, and threats - all these means have been used by the American authorities in Japan and their Japanese puppets to deal with democratic organizations, especially the Communist Party. On the 4th, the national police were on armed alert. In Tokyo alone, 25,000 police officers were mobilized. On the 3rd alone, 24 communists were arrested.

Foreign observers pointed out that few people participated in the election in Tokyo and other cities.

　　美日反动派疯狂镇压  阻挠日民主党派竞选
    东京一地即动员了二万余警察
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社五日电引东京消息：日本参院选举已在四日举行。参院的竞选是在美日反动势力与日本民主分子之间斗争急剧尖锐化的情况下举行的。美帝国主义分子正在加紧重新武装日本，使日本成为对苏联与亚洲各国民主运动发动军事冒险的主要基地。在以执政的自由党为代表的日本反动势力的帮助下，美国战争贩子正企图镇压日本的民主运动。
    美日反动势力的这些计划，遭到了广大日本人民的反对。以日本共产党为首的民主阵线，在其竞选口号中，提出了早日缔结全面和约，在日本恢复主权后立即撤退占领军，禁止在日本修建军事基地，无限制地发展和平工业与人民的民主权利，以及紧密地与世界上爱好和平的力量合作等要求。
    麦克阿瑟总部和日本政府竭力以大规模的镇压手段，来阻挠民主党派的竞选。挑拨、逮捕、诽谤和威胁——所有这一切手段，无一不被在日本的美国当局和他们的日本傀儡用来对付民主组织，首先是对付共产党。在四日那天，全国警察都武装戒备着。仅仅在东京一地，就动员了二万五千名警察。在三日一天中，就有二十四名共产党员被捕。
    外国观察员指出：在东京和其他城市参加选举的人很少。
