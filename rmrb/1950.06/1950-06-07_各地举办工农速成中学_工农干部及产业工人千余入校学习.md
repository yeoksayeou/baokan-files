　　Various Places Establish Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle Schools
    Over a Thousand Worker-Peasant Cadres and Industrial Workers Enroll to Study

    [Our Newspaper] In order to systematically and step-by-step cultivate a new type of intellectual from worker and peasant backgrounds, the National Education Work Conference held last December discussed the issue of universally establishing worker-peasant rapid middle schools. It was requested that all troops, organizations, groups, and schools across the country should, as much as possible, establish rapid middle schools for young workers and peasants, especially for young and adult worker-peasant cadres who have participated in the revolutionary struggle for many years. In the past few months, local people's governments have successively prepared to pilot worker-peasant rapid middle schools to gain experience for universal establishment in the future. According to incomplete statistics, eleven worker-peasant rapid middle schools have been established in Beijing, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Hebei, Shenyang, Harbin, Dalian, Wuxi, Kaifeng, and Xi'an, as well as three worker-peasant rapid middle school classes attached to Hefei No. 1 Middle School, Bengbu Middle School, and Huainan Middle School, with a total enrollment of 1,485 people (excluding Harbin and Hebei). The Ministry of Education has also established the Beijing Experimental Worker-Peasant Rapid Middle School in the capital. The enrollment targets for worker-peasant middle schools in various places are generally active cadres who have participated in the revolutionary struggle for more than three years or industrial workers with more than three years of work experience, and who have a cultural level equivalent to a relatively high elementary school graduate. They are transferred or selected by various agencies, factories, and other groups, and admitted after examination. Various places generally held examinations seriously. For example, in Shenyang Worker-Peasant Rapid Middle School, 226 people applied and 80 were admitted. Among the admitted students, worker-peasant cadres accounted for 56, and workers accounted for 24. Party members accounted for 48% of all students, and League members accounted for 14%. Most of the students are aged between 20 and 26. The curriculum of each school mainly focuses on Chinese and mathematics, followed by politics, history, geography, natural science, and physiology and hygiene, and then sports, music, and art. The teachers are mostly outstanding teachers selected from local middle schools. In order to train teachers for worker-peasant rapid middle schools, the Ministry of Education has specially established a teacher training class for worker-peasant rapid middle schools in Beijing Normal University. The People's Government has also decided to establish a teacher training class by Northeast Normal University to meet the current urgent needs.

　　各地举办工农速成中学
    工农干部及产业工人千余入校学习
    【本报讯】为了有计划有步骤地培养工农出身的新型知识分子，去年十二月举行的全国教育工作会议上，曾讨论普遍举办工农速成中学问题。要求全国的部队、机关、团体和学校都尽可能地为青年工农，首先是为多年参加革命斗争的青年和成年工农干部举办速成中学。数月来，各地人民政府已先后筹备试办工农速成中学，为将来普遍举办取得经验。就目前不完全材料统计，北京、平原、山西、河北、沈阳、哈尔滨、大连、无锡、开封、西安等地已成立工农速成中学十一所及附设在合肥市一中、蚌埠市中、淮南中学的工农速成中学班三班，入学人数共一千四百八十五人（哈尔滨、河北二校未计入）。教育部并在首都设立了北京实验工农速成中学。各地工农中学招生对象，一般是参加革命斗争三年以上的积极干部或有三年以上工龄的产业工人，具有相当高小毕业的文化程度者。由各机关、工厂等团体抽调或选送，经考试后录取。各地一般认真举行了考试，如沈阳市工农速成中学投考者二二六名，录取八十名。录取的学生中工农干部占五十六名，工人二十四名。全体学生中党员占四十八名，团员占十四名。年龄以二十至二十六岁最多。各校课程大致以国文、数学为主，其次是政治、历史、地理、自然、生理卫生，再次是体育、音乐、美术等课。教师大都是由当地各中学中选调的优秀教师。为了培养工农速成中学师资，教育部特在北京师范大学内设立了工农速成中学师资训练班。人民政府亦已决定由东北师范大学设立师训班，以适应目前的迫切需要。
