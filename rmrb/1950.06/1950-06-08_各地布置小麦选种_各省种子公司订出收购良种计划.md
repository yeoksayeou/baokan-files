　　Wheat Seed Selection Arranged in Various Regions
    Seed Companies in Each Province Formulate Plans to Purchase Improved Seeds
    [Report from this Newspaper] (Xinhua News Agency): As the wheat harvest season approaches, local people's governments are, based on the "Instructions on Launching the Wheat Seed Selection Movement" and the "Draft Five-Year Plan for Popularizing Improved Varieties" issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, specifically arranging wheat seed selection work. The people's governments of East China, Central South China, and North China, as well as the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, have successively issued instructions, calling on subordinate levels of people's governments to create specific plans for seed selection and launch the wheat seed selection movement. Shandong, Zhejiang, and other provinces have established seed companies. In Shandong, seed selection committees have been established from the provincial to the county, district, and village levels, and they are currently leading farmers in wheat seed selection. The Shandong Provincial Department of Industry has also sent more than 90 agricultural technicians to various counties to assist in wheat seed selection. Henan, Pingyuan, Shanxi, and other provinces have also dispatched agricultural technicians to rural areas to guide wheat seed selection. Shanxi Province has also designated seven wheat-producing counties, including Hongdong, Quwo, and Xinjiang, as key counties for promoting seed selection work.
    To coordinate with the wheat seed selection movement, the seed companies in each province have formulated plans to purchase improved seeds. For example, the Suiyuan Provincial Seed Company plans to purchase 720,000 jin of high-quality seeds such as wheat and naked oats this year. The Hebei Provincial Seed Company plans to purchase 3 million jin of wheat seeds. The Pingyuan Provincial Seed Company plans to purchase 2.2 million jin of wheat seeds (Hebei and Pingyuan provinces both focus on purchasing rust-resistant wheat seeds). The Chahar Provincial Seed Company plans to purchase 500,000 jin of wheat seeds. The Henan Provincial Seed Company plans to purchase and regulate 2.5 million jin of No. 438 wheat. The Shandong Provincial Seed Company plans to purchase 11 million jin of wheat seeds. The seed companies in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, as well as in the four districts of Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, and Northern Anhui, plan to purchase a total of 7.4 million jin of wheat seeds.
