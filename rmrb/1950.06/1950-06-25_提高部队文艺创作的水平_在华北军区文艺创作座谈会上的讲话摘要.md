　　Raising the Level of Literary and Artistic Creation in the Military
    ——Excerpts from a Speech at the North China Military Region Literary and Artistic Creation Symposium
    Zhang Zhixiang
    The literary and artistic work of the North China Military Region has achieved certain successes, cultivated some cadres, and accumulated some experience. However, the role it has played is not yet significant enough. The main reason for this is that we, in leadership positions, have lacked timely summarization of experience, and have not taken the next step in improvement. Specific guidance has also been insufficient. We should strengthen this aspect in the future.

    The creation conference convened this time (mainly to study playwriting) is an important meeting, because we believe this is a crucial issue in the current literary and artistic work of the military. If the creation problem is not resolved, it will be difficult to carry out literary and artistic work. Mass literary and artistic activities (soldiers performing for soldiers) have been launched, but due to the lack of guidance for improvement, they have stagnated at a certain level and cannot move forward. Professional performing arts troupes lack scripts to perform, so we must use great effort to resolve this.

    To enable the military to produce excellent creations, some ideological and organizational issues must be resolved.

    The issue of creation in coordination with specific tasks. In the past, the military was in a long-term war environment, and the war was extremely tense and cruel. The primary task at that time was to mobilize and organize our forces to eliminate the enemy and achieve victory. The military's literary and artistic work was closely integrated with this task, specifically manifested in our use of the intervals between battles, and even during battles, to carry out creative activities as much as possible, using literature and art to enlighten awareness, boost morale, and coordinate with other educational methods to solve a specific ideological problem existing in the military at that time. Because if the main ideological obstacles were not resolved, the battle tasks at hand could not be carried out smoothly. This approach was absolutely necessary and correct. However, precisely because of the tension and cruelty of the war, the creations at that time, generally speaking, could not but be "hasty productions," and ideological and artistic qualities were greatly limited, appearing crude, with strong agitation and insufficient persuasiveness. Today, the situation has changed, and we have entered a new period of construction, which requires and allows us to improve our creation. The task we must closely combine with is the long-term task of building the army, consolidating our glorious traditions through literary and artistic work, and on this basis, cultivating the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, and creating the emotions, character, and morality that a revolutionary soldier of the new Chinese national defense army should possess. Use it to educate the troops, improve their awareness and combat effectiveness, and use it to educate the people, consolidate the unity of the military and the people, and the unity of the military and the government. We must closely combine this task, that is, literature and art serve politics. But we cannot therefore think that our approach is still the same as in wartime, blindly following temporary specific tasks. To demand playwriting in this way will make creation lose foresight, easily cause the works to have shortcomings of one-sidedness, and at best play the role of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, and it is impossible to focus on long-term construction, to solve the fundamental links in army building, to carry out arduous work to create new characters and souls. For the military's professional authors, we are requiring them to do this, and not doing so essentially reduces their responsibility and weakens the due role of the military's literary and artistic work. At the same time, we should also make appropriate division of labor for professional performing arts troupes and company literary and artistic activities, and make them integrate and complement each other to coordinate with specific tasks. Mass self-education and entertainment are mainly the tasks of company entertainment activities. Professional authors and performing arts troupes should often study and absorb mass creations from this popular movement to enrich themselves, and in addition to guiding the mass literary and artistic movement with a certain amount of force, they mainly use their own creations and performances to guide and improve the mass literary and artistic movement.

    Along with the narrow creative thinking of coordinating with temporary specific tasks, the problem of selecting themes arises. Some people believe that the rich struggle experiences of the past are outdated, and only by grasping the current themes can we target the military's thinking, coordinate with tasks, and solve problems. This is a view that separates history. As everyone knows, since Chairman Mao created the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he has stipulated the aim of serving the people wholeheartedly, and various army-building principles based on this aim. These have become the foundation of our army's glorious history and great victory.

    We will use this glorious history to educate our new soldiers and future generations, and carry it forward, making it a material force to achieve greater victories in the future. Can we say that works with the history of our army as the theme are outdated? Obviously not. How we fought, how we grew, and how we achieved victory, as long as we accurately grasp Chairman Mao's army-building thought and powerfully reflect it in our works, will have a very practical educational significance. The problem is that we have too few works reflecting the great People's Liberation War. We can imagine, if someone writes a play reflecting that in the early days of the Red Army, there were only a few thousand people, extremely difficult, but because of the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, everyone had the spirit and confidence to fight with powerful domestic and foreign enemies until they were defeated and liberated all of China, what a huge and touching force it would have, the power to solve ideological problems. This is realistic Marxist-Leninist and communist education; selfless education that firmly believes in the victory of truth. Therefore, the view that past themes are not suitable for today's task needs is wrong. Our authors, authors with a certain level of creative ability, are mostly familiar with the struggle life and military life of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War. They should carefully sort them out, concentrate them, and draw up writing plans, and the leadership should give them a certain amount of time and convenience so that the great struggle and heroic spirit of the Chinese people can be most movingly recorded.

    Of course, this does not mean that we can close our doors and write "history." This is only one aspect. In addition to this, we must also face new things. History is always moving forward. Our army has become an unprecedentedly powerful national defense army. It is rapidly sweeping away the guerrillaism left over from the long-term war and is becoming increasingly regularized. It is strictly training itself to be able to undertake the glorious task of protecting national defense and protecting world lasting peace. Patriotism and internationalism have new content in the new era of the newly born China. After the people have their own unified country, they have their own new moral content and standards. The new struggle, the struggle to build the people's motherland, is even more magnificent and great. New types of people and new characters are constantly emerging in the new struggle. The new is being born, and the old is being abandoned. There are new contradictions and struggles in it. These are obviously not completely solved by historical themes. Therefore, we must always not forget to go deep into the actual struggle, go deep into the construction work of the national defense army, and write new characters, new personalities, and new struggles.

    The choice of themes, whether past or present, is not the key to whether a work has realistic value (educational significance). The problem lies in the ideological level and artistic level of the work, that is, whether the theme of the work can be aimed at reality without forgetting the long-term future, relying on images to move people rather than dry preaching.

    The primary problem is the ideological nature of the work. The biggest weakness of our existing works is that the ideological level is not high. Our authors have been in the army for a long time, and their lives are generally rich. They are familiar with the army, but their political study is insufficient, which makes us unable to grasp the most essential issues from the chaotic phenomena and concentrate them. Therefore, even if they reflect some military life, they do not grasp the source of vitality. At the same time, they often show one-sidedness of thought, oppose the remnants of warlordism, but encourage tolerance of soldiers' shortcomings and errors, with praise but no criticism. Our authors must strive to improve politically and ideologically before they can go deep into the army (without turning a blind eye to essential issues) and improve the ideological level of our works.

    Writing characters is still very unsuccessful. The characters in the plays rarely leave people with a vivid, prominent, and profound impression. Like a camera not focused properly, the portraits are blurred. The development of the characters does not show the trajectory of their ideological changes; the emotional changes resulting from this, and the language that can most accurately express their thoughts and feelings. We mostly only write about people's appearance, but not their souls, or only write about some real but scattered characters, without concentrating and improving them. Therefore, the impression given to people is superficial and scattered. In particular, there are not many depictions of cadres in the works, and they are the most unsuccessful. We must never write plays without cadres, nor can we simply treat cadres as foils. The masses must have leadership, and the leadership must be specifically reflected in the works, mainly through cadres. But our authors are not familiar with and understand the leadership very well. In the future, we must strengthen the in-depth study of characters, especially cadres, in the military.

    In order to create better works, everyone should work hard, strengthen political study and the cultivation of literary and artistic theory, read more Chinese and foreign, especially Soviet works, and further go deep into the military, to treat their creative career seriously. This is the key. In addition, the leadership should recognize that in the new period of construction in New China, a cultural upsurge will soon appear. In order to meet this upsurge, we must attach great importance to the literary and artistic work of the military, and currently we must pay close attention to literary and artistic creation. Specifically, we should concentrate the creative talents we have cultivated for more than ten years, give them the necessary time and conditions, strengthen their ideological leadership and artistic guidance, pay attention to enriching their political life, and strictly demand them. Due to the highly centralized nature of the military, as long as the leadership attaches importance to this work, it will quickly achieve results.

　　提高部队文艺创作的水平
    ——在华北军区文艺创作座谈会上的讲话摘要
    张致祥
    华北军区的文艺工作，有它一定的成绩，培养了一些干部，积累了一些经验。但是发挥的作用还不够大。其主要原因，是我们领导上缺乏及时总结经验，提高一步，具体的指导亦嫌不足。今后对这方面应当加强。
    这次所召集的创作会议（主要是研究剧本创作），是一个重要的会议，因为我们认为这是在当前部队文艺工作中带关键性的问题。创作问题不解决，文艺工作的开展是很困难的。群众性的文艺活动（兵演兵）是开展起来了，但由于缺乏提高的指导，停留在一定的水平，不能前进，专业文工团缺乏剧本上演，所以我们必须用大力来解决。
    要使部队有优秀的创作产生，须解决一些思想上和组织上的问题。
    创作配合具体任务问题。部队过去长期处于战争的环境，而战争又是极为紧张残酷的，当时的首要任务就是如何动员组织我们的力量去消灭敌人，取得胜利。部队的文艺工作，就是紧密地结合这一任务的，具体表现在我们利用了战斗与战斗的间隙，以至于在战斗中，尽一切可能进行创作活动，用文艺来启发觉悟、鼓舞斗志，配合其他教育方式，解决部队当时存在的某一个思想问题。因为倘使主要的思想障碍不解决，就不能顺利地遂行摆在面前的战斗任务。这样的作法，是完全必要的，并且是正确的。但是也正因为战争的紧张残酷，当时的创作，一般说来，不能不是“急就章”，思想性和艺术性不能不受到很大的限制，表现为粗糙，鼓动性较强，说服力不足。今天情况改变了，我们已进入了建设的新时期，要求并且许可我们把创作提高一步。我们所要紧密地结合的任务，就是长期建军的任务，通过文艺工作，巩固我们的光荣传统，并在这个基础之上，培养爱国主义与国际主义的精神，创造作为新中国国防军一个革命军人应具有的情感、品性和道德。以之教育部队，提高部队的觉悟与战斗力，以之教育人民，巩固军民一致、军政一致。我们要紧密地结合这一任务，也就是文艺为政治服务。但我们不能因此认为我们的作法上，仍同战时一样，一味跟着临时具体任务跑，这样去要求剧本创作，就将使创作丧失远见，容易使作品发生片面性的缺点，顶多起到头痛医头，脚痛医脚的作用，而不可能从长期建设着眼，为解决建军中的根本环节问题，为创造新的人物与灵魂进行艰巨的工作，对于部队的专业作者来说，我们正要求他们这样来作，不这样，实质上是降低了他们的责任，削弱了部队文艺工作应有的作用。同时我们也应当对专业文工团与连队文艺活动，作适当的分工，并使之互相结合，互相补充，配合具体任务。群众自我教育与娱乐，这主要是连队文娱活动的任务，专业作者和文工团应当从这一普及运动中，经常研究与吸取群众的创作，来丰富自己，而自己除了以一定力量辅导群众的文艺运动外，又主要以自己的创作与演出来指导与提高群众的文艺运动。
    随着狭隘的配合临时具体任务观点的创作思想而来的，产生了选择题材的问题。有的人认为过去的丰富的斗争经历，过时了，只有抓取当前的题材，才算针对部队思想、配合任务、解决问题，这是割裂历史的看法。大家都知道从毛主席手创中国人民解放军以来，就规定了全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，和根据这一宗旨的各项建军原则，这些已成为我军光辉历史与伟大胜利的基础。
    我们将以这一光辉历史教育我们的新战士和后一代，并且发扬光大它，使之成为取得未来更伟大胜利的物质力量，我们能够说以我军的历史为题材的作品过时了吗？显然是不能的。我们怎样战斗过来的，怎样成长和取得胜利的，只要我们确切地掌握住毛主席的建军思想，有力地反映在我们的作品中，将具有非常实际的教育意义，问题在于我们反映伟大的人民解放战争的作品太少了。我们可以设想，假如有人写出一个剧本反映红军初创时，只有几千人，极端艰苦，但由于有共产党和毛主席的领导，人人具有与强大的国内外敌人搏斗直至把他们打倒解放全中国的气魄和信心，将有怎样巨大的感人的力量，解决思想问题的力量。这是现实的马列主义、共产主义教育；忘我的，坚信真理胜利的教育。因此认为过去的题材不适于今天任务的需要的观点，是不对的。我们的作者，具有一定创作水平的作者，大都对于抗日战争、人民解放战争的斗争生活、军队生活是熟悉的，应当好好整理起来，集中起来，订出写作计划，而领导上应给予一定时间和便利，以便将中国人民的伟大斗争与英雄气概有最动人的纪录。
    当然这并不是说，我们关起门来写“历史”就可以了，这只是一方面，除此，我们还必须面对新的事物。历史总是在前进的，我们军队已经成为空前强大的国防军，它在迅速扫除着长期战争遗留下来的游击主义作风，而日益正规化；它在严格地训练着自己，使自己足以担当保护国防，保护世界持久和平的光荣任务；爱国主义与国际主义精神有着它在新中国已经诞生的新时期的崭新内容。在人民有了自己的统一的国家之后，有着自己新的道德的内容与标准。新的斗争，为建设人民祖国的斗争，是更加瑰丽伟大；新的斗争中在不断地涌现新型的人物、新的人物的性格。新的在诞生，旧的在扬弃，里面存在着新的矛盾和斗争，这些显然不是用历史题材所能完全解决的。因此我们还必须时时刻刻不忘记深入到现实的斗争中去，深入到国防军的建设工作中去，写新的人物、新的性格、新的斗争。
    题材的选择，无论是过去的，或现在的，并不是作品有无现实价值（教育意义）的关键，问题在于作品的思想水平与艺术水平，也就是说作品的主题思想，能否针对现实而又不忘记远大前途，依靠形象感人而不是枯燥地说教。
    首要的问题，是作品的思想性。我们现有的作品的最大弱点，是思想水平不高。我们作者经过长期的入伍，生活一般说是丰富的，对于部队是熟悉的，但是政治学习不足，这就使我们不能从紊乱的现象中，抓住最本质的问题，将它集中起来，因此即使反映了一些部队生活，而并未抓住活力的源泉。同时常常表现思想的片面性，反对军阀主义残余，却又鼓励对战士缺点错误的姑息，有表扬而无批评。我们作者必须努力在政治上思想上提高一步，然后才能深入部队（不致于对本质的问题熟视无睹），提高我们作品的思想水平。
    写人物还很不成功。戏剧中的人物，很少能留给人以鲜明突出深刻的印象。像照像机没有对准焦点一样，人像是模糊的。人物的发展，看不清他思想变化的轨迹；由此产生的感情变化，和足以最确切地表现他的思想感情的语言。我们还多半只是写了人的外貌，而没有写出人的灵魂，或者只写了些虽然是现实的但是散见的人物，而没有集中起来，提高一步。因此给人的印象是浮面的、分散的。特别是作品里对干部写得不多，也最不成功。我们决不能写没有干部的戏，也不能仅仅把干部只当做陪衬。群众必须有领导，作品里具体地体现领导，主要要通过干部。但我们作者对领导很不熟悉了解。我们今后在入伍中，必须加强对人物的深入研究，尤其对于干部。
    为了能创作出更好的作品，大家应刻苦努力，加强政治学习与文艺理论的修养，多读中国与外国尤其是苏联的作品，进一步深入入伍，以严肃地对待自己的创作事业。这是关键。另外，领导上应当认识在新中国建设的新时期，不久将出现一个文化的高潮，为了迎接这个高潮，要十分重视部队文艺工作，当前尤须十分关心文艺创作，具体地说，我们应当把十多年培养起来的创作人才，集中起来，给予他们以必要的时间与条件，加强对他们的思想领导与艺术指导，注意丰富他们的政治生活，并严格地要求他们。由于部队高度集中的特点，只要领导重视这一工作，将迅速获得成效。
