　　Achievements of Centralized Production in Hegang Coal Mine

　　In the new record creation movement in November last year, the Hegang Coal Mine in Northeast China grasped the main link of improving production, boldly broke through the old ways, and implemented a major production reform of reducing working faces, concentrating machinery, and rationally organizing labor. Over the past few months, significant achievements have been made in terms of the effectiveness of machinery, management, production, safety, and reducing consumption and lowering costs.

　　The mine began to consider centralized production in June last year. By early September, a unified planning organization – the planning office – was established for the whole mine, and necessary material research and preparation work was carried out. In November, combined with the full launch of the new record movement, the initial stage of transitioning from decentralized to centralized production was basically completed with a spirit of blitzkrieg.

　　During the process of concentrating working faces, all security personnel spent seven days concentrating 352 working faces in the entire mine into 144, and completed the sealing of 208 working faces that had ceased operations. At the same time, the trade union and the administration carried out personnel quota education among workers, explaining the significance of quotas to the workers, and ensuring that surplus personnel would be given appropriate work, eliminating the workers' ideological concerns, thus smoothly carrying out the personnel adjustment and allocation of the new labor organization. All 860 people who were surplus to requirements in the whole mine have been properly resettled. The new labor organization was formed through voluntary association and approved by the management committee. Therefore, the workers are very satisfied, and the attendance rate and labor efficiency have generally improved. In terms of mechanical equipment, reasonable adjustments were made according to production needs.

　　After centralized production, the following significant achievements were made:

　　From the perspective of mechanical efficiency: the efficiency of the winch has increased by 67% compared to before. Calculating the average efficiency of all machinery, the efficiency after centralization increased by 40.6% compared to before.

　　From the perspective of mining and excavation efficiency: production efficiency has increased by 27.2%. The ratio of coal mining to tunneling has also changed from the previously unreasonable situation to a normal ratio of 8 to 2.

　　From the perspective of improving production management: In the thirteen administrative pits, according to the needs of specialized division of labor, each pit is equipped with one pit leader who is in charge of overall work, one first deputy pit leader who is in charge of coal mining and security work, one second deputy pit leader who is in charge of mechanical and electrical work, and one third deputy pit leader who is in charge of cost and material work. Each person has a separate organization under him, with a clear division of labor and responsibility. Therefore, management work is much more convenient than before.

　　From the perspective of security work: Due to the improvement of ventilation management and the increase of air volume, accidents have been greatly reduced. Taking Dongshan Mine as an example, comparing the four months before and after centralized production, accidents decreased from 159 to 72, a decrease of 102%, and casualties decreased by 61%.

　　From the perspective of reducing consumption and lowering costs: In total, in January of this year compared to November of last year (before centralized production), the cost of coal was reduced by 15%.

　　Now, on the basis of centralized production, the mine has entered the second stage of highly centralized production since May 1st. It is planned that within 1950, the entire mine can achieve 80% mechanized mining.

### 鹤岗煤矿实行集中生产的成绩

　　鹤岗煤矿实行集中生产的成绩
    东北鹤岗煤矿在去年十一月创新纪录运动中，抓住了提高生产的主要环节，大胆突破旧的一套，实行了减少掌子，集中机械，合理组织劳力的生产大改革。几个月来，在机械效能的发挥方面、管理、生产、安全方面，以及减少消耗降低成本方面，都做出了显著的成绩。
    该矿于去年六月开始酝酿集中生产，至九月初，建立起全局统一的计划组织——计划室，进行了必要的材料研究和准备工作。十一月，结合着新纪录运动的全面开展，以突击的精神，基本上完成了由分散步向集中生产的初步阶段。
    在集中掌子过程中，全体保安人员以七天的时间，将全矿三百五十二个掌子集中为一百四十四个，并完成了停止作业的二百零八个掌子的密闭工作。同时，工会与行政在工人中展开定员教育，向工人说明定员意义，并保证给编余人员以适当工作，消除了工人的思想顾虑，因而顺利的进行了新的劳动组织的人员调整和配备。全局编余的八百六十人，均已作了妥善的安置。新的劳动组织是通过自愿结合，经管理委员会批准而组成的。因此工人都非常满意，出勤率和劳动效率普遍提高。在机械设备方面，则根据生产的需要，进行了合理的调剂。
    集中生产后，有了下述显著成绩：
    从机械效能上来看：绞车效能较前提高百分之六十七。以全部机械平均效率计算，集中后的效率则较前增加百分之四十点六。
    从采掘效率上来看：生产效率提高了百分之二十七点二。采煤与掘进的比例亦改变了过去不合理的情况为正常的八与二之比。
    从生产管理的改进上来看：在十三个行政坑口中，根据专业化分工的需要，每坑配备了掌握全面工作的坑长一人，掌握采煤、保安工作的第一副坑长一人，掌握机电工作的第二副坑长一人，掌握成本、材料工作的第三副坑长一人。每人下设单独组织，明确分工，各负专责。因此在管理工作上较前方便得多。
    从保安工作上来看：由于改进通风管理，增加风量的结果，使事故大为减少。以东山矿为例，集中生产前后四个月的对比，事故由一百五十九次减至七十二次，减少百分之一百零二，伤亡则减少百分之六十一。
    从消耗减少、成本降低上来看：总计今年一月份较去年十一月（未集中生产前），煤的成本减低了百分之十五。
    现在该矿在集中生产的基础上，自五月一日起，已进入高度集中生产的第二阶段，计划在一九五○年之内，全矿可以做到百分之八十的机械化开采。
