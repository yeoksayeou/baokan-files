I. Significant Achievements

Since its opening on May 2nd, the Shenyang Workers' and Peasants' Fast-Track Middle School has begun to get on the right track. Currently, most students have learned to write short essays, divide them into paragraphs, and use common punctuation marks. The students' initial math levels were generally low, with many never having formally studied arithmetic, but they have made rapid progress. The average score for Class A improved by seven points, and Class B improved by twenty-four points between the previous and following exams. These achievements have greatly strengthened the confidence of teachers and students in completing the basic middle school curriculum in three to four years.

II. "Learning Determination Movement"

In over a month of teaching, the school has prioritized ideological education for students and teachers. At the beginning, some students had a relatively vague understanding of the government's purpose in establishing the Workers' and Peasants' Fast-Track Middle School, viewing it as a training or tutoring class. They lacked sufficient awareness of the importance of mastering a relatively systematic foundation of cultural and scientific knowledge to become the backbone of building a new China in the future. Some students were also concerned about their families and unwilling to study for a long time. Older students feared not keeping up with the coursework and lacked confidence. In response to these situations, the school launched the "Learning Determination Movement." It organized student discussions to inspire their awareness of systematically learning cultural and scientific knowledge, and educated everyone through typical reports based on the students' own experiences. After "ideological study," all teachers and students wrote letters of determination. Some students reflected on their thoughts and resolved, "To fulfill the Party and the people's expectations of me, I want to swear to the Party and the people that I will resolutely overcome all difficulties, dispel thoughts of family, and persist in learning."

III. Enhancing Teachers' Political Awareness

Most of the school's teachers were outstanding teachers selected from various middle schools in Shenyang. They were enthusiastic and active in their work, but had not taught students from worker and peasant backgrounds before. Some teachers, seeing that most students were cadres with higher political levels than themselves, were afraid of not teaching well. Others, seeing the uneven cultural levels of the students, felt uncertain about completing the teaching plan in three to four years. To address this, the school organized all teachers to study various instructions and documents related to establishing workers' and peasants' middle schools, enabling them to understand the importance of current workers' and peasants' education and recognize that serving as a teacher for the worker and peasant masses was a glorious political task. At the same time, teacher-student forums were held to increase teachers' understanding of worker and peasant students. During the students' "Learning Determination Movement," many students recounted the pain of lacking education in the past and their spirit of arduous learning for the revolutionary cause, which deeply moved many teachers. They expressed their determination to overcome difficulties and teach patiently. Many teachers actively sought students' opinions, studied student characteristics, and gradually improved their teaching methods.

IV. Improving Teaching Organization and Creating New Teaching Methods

In terms of teaching organization, the school divided students into two classes, A and B, based on their cultural levels. When dividing learning groups, they also followed high, elementary, and intermediate levels, with each group consisting of four to seven people. This made the students' levels in each class more consistent, making it easier for teachers to provide teaching guidance. At the same time, it also allowed for mutual assistance among students.

In terms of teaching, the school gradually explored some new methods tailored to the students' characteristics. Generally, students have rich life experiences and strong comprehension abilities, but they are older and have poorer memory. Therefore, the school's teaching focused on the principles of connecting to reality and repeated practice. The curriculum arrangement was relatively concentrated, with self-study following each lesson, giving students ample time for previewing and reviewing. At the same time, teachers also focused on guiding students in previewing and reviewing. During class, they tried to find practical examples from daily life to explain the text, helping students remember. Some students had very poor math levels, so the school's teachers also held math tutoring classes after school. In Chinese language class, in addition to pre- and post-class preview and review, bulletin boards were set up in the dining hall, dormitory, and recreation room to introduce the new characters and words learned each day. Chinese language teacher Chen Tiebin also created a new method for guiding students' writing: First, over a relatively long period of time, systematically focus on guiding students to write articles of the same genre, allowing them to practice continuously and apply the experience gained from the previous writing to the next. Second, for each writing assignment, help students who write poorly to "rewrite." The teacher individually and in detail tells the student the shortcomings of the first draft, instructing him on how to rewrite. If necessary, he can write a third time, ensuring that the student's writing can reach a level commensurate with his existing knowledge. Because students have rich life experiences, if the topic is appropriate, each student has ample and vivid material. Although this method takes more time for both teachers and students, the students benefit greatly and are very satisfied. After more than a month of trial implementation, there have been significant achievements.

　　沈阳速成中学初期教学经验
    本报特约通讯员  王静
    一、显著的成绩
    沈阳市工农速成中学，自五月二日开学以来，学习已开始上了轨道。现在，一般的学生已学会了写短文，会分段落，会应用普通的标点符号了。同学们原来的数学程度一般较低，不少人从未正式学过算术，但进步很快，前后考试的成绩，甲班平均提高了七分，乙班提高了二十四分。这些成绩，大大地增强了师生在三、四年内教完与学完中学基本课程的信心。
    二、“学习决心运动”
    在一个多月的教学工作中，该校首先重视了学生与教师的思想教育。刚开学时，一部分学生对政府举办工农速成中学的宗旨认识比较模糊，把速成中学看成是过去训练班或补习班，对于使自己掌握比较有系统的文化科学基础知识，以便将来成为建设新中国的骨干这一点认识不足。也有少数同学挂念家庭，不愿长期学习。年纪大的同学则怕赶不上功课，信心不强。学校针对上述情况，发动了“学习决心运动”。组织同学讨论，启发其有系统地学习文化科学知识的自觉性；并通过典型报告的方式，用同学们自己的切身经验来教育大家。全体师生经过“思想学习”，都写了决心书。有的同学反省了自己的思想，下定决心说：“为实现党和人民对我的期望，我要向党和人民宣誓，坚决克服一切困难，打消挂念家庭思想，坚持学习。”
    三、提高教员政治认识
    该校教员大部是由沈市各中学选调来的优秀教师，工作积极热情，但过去未教过工农干部出身的学生。有的教师看到学生大多数是干部，政治水平比自己高，怕教不好；另有些教员看到学生文化程度高低不齐，对三、四年中完成教学计划感到没有把握。该校为此组织全体教员学习了有关创办工农中学的各种指示和文件，使其了解目前工农教育的重要性，认识担任工农群众的教师是光荣的政治任务。同时，举行了师生座谈会，增进教师对工农学生的了解。在学生们开展“学习决心运动”中，许多学生诉述过去没有文化的痛苦及其为革命事业艰苦学习的精神，这使许多教师深受感动，表示要决心克服困难，耐心地教下去。不少教师多方征求学生意见，研究学生特点，逐步改进了教学方法。
    四、健全教学组织创造新的教学方法
    在教学组织方面，该校根据学生文化程度，分为甲、乙两班；划分学习小组时，亦按照程度分高、初、中三种，每组以四人至七人为度。这样，各班学生的程度较整齐，教师在教学指导上就比较方便，同时，也可以发挥同学之间的互助。
    在教学方面，该校针对学生的特点，逐步摸索到了一些新的方法。因为一般学生都有较丰富的生活经验，理解能力强，但年龄大，记忆力差。为此，该校的教学掌握了联系实际、反复练习的原则。课程的排列比较集中，每上一课之后，跟着是自习，给学生以充分预习、复习的时间。同时，教师也抓紧对学生预习、复习的指导。上课时尽量在日常生活中找实际例子来解释课文，以帮助学生记忆。一部分学生数学程度太差，该校教员又在课外举办了数学补习班。在国文课方面，除上课前后的预复习之外，并在饭堂、寝室、游艺室等处设置揭示板，介绍每天学习的生字、生词。国文教员陈铁镔并创造了指导学生作文的新方法：第一，在一个相当长的时间内，有计划地集中指导学生写作同一种体裁的文章，使其能连续练习，把上一次作文中获得的经验运用于下一次。第二，每一次作文，对写作较差的同学，帮助他“重写”。教员个别地、详细地告诉学生头一遍所写文章中的缺点，指示他如何重写。必要时，可以再写第三次，务使学生的作文能够达到与他已有知识相称的程度。因为学生都有丰富的生活经验，如果命题恰当，每个学生都是有充分生动的材料的。这种方法虽然师生都费时较多，但学生得益很大，学生都很满意。试行一个多月，就有了显著的成绩。
