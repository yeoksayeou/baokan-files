　　Strengthen Investigation Work, Actively Develop Business
    Local Native Product Companies Exchange Native Products
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to implement the spirit of the National Native Products Conference, local native product companies are now actively developing their businesses, strengthening investigation work, and organizing the exchange of native products.
    The Beijing Native Products Company, due to changing its business methods, proactively goes to the streets, finds sales channels, and organized an investigation team to contact factories and stores. Recently, it learned that the Yanjing and People's paper mills alone need 7-8 tons of Guangdong No. 1 rosin and 7-8 tons of Monkey King alum each month. Other machinery factories also need a lot of rosin. Therefore, it requested goods from the Guangdong Native Products Company and is also inquiring about prices from Zhejiang. In addition, the company also actively contacted the Supply and Marketing Department of the Revolutionary University, the New China Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the supply and marketing cooperatives of various government agencies and entertainment venues, selling more than 10,000 jin of black melon seeds and 4,000 jin of sunflower seeds. It also supported the production of several vermicelli factories by purchasing 160,000 jin of vermicelli, some of which have been sold to Tianjin merchants. The company also consulted with the Tianjin Office of the Northeast Trade Department and initially tried to sell more than 20,000 jin of lard, 1,000 jin of "yuan mushroom", and 5,000 jin of honey. The lard was sold out completely within ten days, and a contract for selling large quantities of oil has now been renewed with the office. The company recently received more than 50 pieces of grass mats, totaling 4,400, from Ningbo, Taizhou and other places from Zhejiang Provincial Company, which have been distributed to department stores and retail companies for consignment sales.
    The Zhejiang Native Products Company learned that the province needs 140,000 jin of gypsum from Jiangxi, 30,000 jin of red dates from Shandong, 20,000 jin of black dates from Pingyuan, 10,000 jin of Longkou vermicelli from Shandong, 5,000 jin of golden needle vegetables, and 50,000 jin of salted meat from Northern Jiangsu. After reporting to the superior company, the China Native Products Company instructed the above-mentioned provincial companies to directly contact the Zhejiang Provincial Company to carry out coordination.
    The Shijiazhuang Native Products Company recently carried a variety of medicinal materials to Hankou for trial sales. The Henan Provincial Company also transported the province's tobacco leaves to Tianjin for trial sales, and 600 packages have been sold. The tea transported to Tianjin by the Wuhu Native Products Company has also sold more than 500 dan. Other native product companies in Guangzhou, Hankou, Hunan, Chongqing, Southern Anhui, Bengbu, and other places have also contacted Tianjin and other places by telegram and by sending people to promote sales.
    Judging from the above situation, after the National Native Products Conference, the national trade in native products has gradually become unified and in step, which is extremely beneficial to opening up sales channels for native products, supplying industrial needs, and maintaining the production of native products in various regions.

　　加强调查工作积极开展业务
    各地土产公司交流土产
    【本报讯】各地土产公司，为贯彻全国土产会议精神，现正积极开展业务，加强调查工作，组织土产交流。
    北京市土产公司由于改变了经营方式，主动跑街，找销路，组织了调查小组，赴各工厂、商店联系，最近了解到仅燕京、人民两造纸厂每月即需用广东一号松香七至八吨，猴王明矾七至八吨，其他各机器厂需用松香亦甚多。因此便向广东土产公司要货，向浙江方面亦在询问价格。此外，该公司又主动与革大供销科、新中国供销社及各机关供销社、娱乐场所联系，销出了黑瓜子一万余斤，葵花子四千余斤。又由于收购了粉丝十六万斤，支持了若干粉场的生产。其中一部并已出售给津商。该公司又曾与东北贸易部驻津办事处协商，首批试销猪油二万余斤，元蘑千斤，蜂蜜五千斤，在十天内即已将猪油全部销出，现又与该办事处续订代销大油合同。该公司最近接浙江省公司发来之宁波、台州等地草席五十余件，计四千四百余条，已分发百货、零售公司委托代售。
    浙江土产公司了解到该省需要江西石膏十四万斤，山东红枣三万斤，平原乌枣二万斤，山东龙口粉丝一万斤，金针菜五千斤，苏北咸肉五万斤等，报告上级公司后，中国土产公司即指示以上各省公司与浙江省公司直接联系，进行调剂。
    石家庄土产公司最近携带药材多种，到汉口试行推销。河南省公司亦将该省烟叶运津试销，并已销出六百包。芜湖土产公司运津之茶叶亦已销出五百多担。其他广州、汉口、湖南、重庆、皖南、蚌埠等地土产公司，亦曾先后用电报及派人赴津及各地联系，进行推销工作。
    从以上情况看来，全国土产会议以后，全国土产贸易已逐步趋向统一与步调一致，这对打开土产销路，供给工业需要与维持各地土产的生产，均极为有利。（中国土产公司通讯组）
