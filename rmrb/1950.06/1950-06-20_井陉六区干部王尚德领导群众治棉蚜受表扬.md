　　Jingxing Sixth District Cadre Wang Shangde Praised for Leading the Masses in Treating Cotton Aphids
　　Comrade Wang Shangde, Propaganda Committee member of the Sixth District of Jingxing, Hebei, is conscientious in his daily work and pays attention to studying production techniques in leading production. Recently, while leading farmers in wheat harvesting in Shizhuang, he discovered that cotton seedlings on more than 40 mu of land in the village were generally infested with cotton aphids. However, farmers did not pay much attention to this problem because they were busy with wheat harvesting and sowing. After Wang Shangde conducted individual interviews with farmers, he understood their thinking. Some farmers did poorly last year because of late sowing, and the late-harvested wheat also suffered hail damage. These families, having learned from last year's lessons, were only concerned with rushing to harvest and sow. Others did not fully understand the seriousness of cotton aphids' harm to cotton seedlings. Based on these thoughts, Comrade Wang Shangde used the evenings to convene mass meetings and conducted in-depth publicity and mobilization. After the mobilization, the masses paid attention to this work. Comrade Wang Shangde and the masses came up with a solution: establish a cotton aphid treatment technology research group in the village, uniformly prepare pesticides for the entire village, and organize all women and children to participate in cotton aphid treatment. This ensured that rushing to harvest and sow would not be delayed, and the cotton aphids were treated.

　　After the meeting, he and the members of the aphid treatment technology research group found tobacco leaves and lime, prepared more than 670 jin of pesticide to distribute to the farmers, and personally went to the fields to provide specific guidance and help farmers treat cotton aphids. Under his active guidance, the cotton aphids were all killed in two days, and more than 40 mu of cotton seedlings were completely saved. The Jingxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specially issued a notice to the entire county to commend him.

　　井陉六区干部王尚德领导群众治棉蚜受表扬
    河北井陉六区宣传委员王尚德同志，平日工作踏实，并在领导生产中注意研究生产技术。最近他在柿庄领导农民麦收当中，发现该村的四十多亩棉苗普遍生了棉蚜。但农民因为忙于麦收及播种，对此问题均不重视。经过王尚德对农民进行个别访问，了解了农民的思想。有的因为去年播种晚，秋天收成就不好，收割迟的麦子还受过雹灾。这样的人家，接受了去年的教训，所以只顾抢收、抢种。有的是对棉蚜危害棉苗的严重性认识不足。根据这些思想，王尚德同志便利用晚上召开了群众大会，作了深入的宣传动员。经过了动员，使群众重视了这一工作。王尚德同志和群众想出了办法：在村里成立治蚜技术研究小组，全村统一配制药水，把所有的妇女儿童都组织起来参加治蚜。这样使抢收抢种不致耽误，又治了棉蚜。
    会后他便与治蚜技术研究小组的组员们找了烟叶、石灰，配制了六百七十多斤药水分给农民，并亲自下地具体指导，帮助农民治棉蚜。在他的积极指导下，两天的工夫棉蚜全被治死，四十多亩棉苗完全得救。中共井陉县委特通报全县，给予表扬。
