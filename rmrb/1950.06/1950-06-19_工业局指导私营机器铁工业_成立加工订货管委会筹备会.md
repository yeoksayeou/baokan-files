　　[Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal Industry Bureau, in order to improve the public-private relationship between the private machine and iron industry and state organs in processing and ordering, and with the assistance of the industry and commerce working group of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, led the industry to establish a preparatory committee for the Processing and Ordering Management Committee on the 11th of this month. In addition to the Industry Bureau and the Machine and Metal Industry Association, the Iron Industry Trade Union also participated in this organization.

　　Since the liberation of Beijing, most of the large and medium-sized factories in the machine and iron industry have been processing orders for the government and state-owned enterprises, playing a certain role in completing the production tasks of state organs. The factories themselves have also been able to maintain or develop as a result. However, due to a lack of overall management, many shortcomings have occurred in the processing and ordering process: sometimes the quantity and quality of the orders undertaken by factories are not suitable for their own production capacity, which affects product quality, specifications, and delays the completion of tasks; sometimes, due to inaccurate cost calculations by state organs, the profit margins for orders from various organs are inconsistent and vary greatly. If the profit is too high, the state organs suffer losses, and if it is too low, the reasonable profit of the factory cannot be taken into account; there are also a few factories that cut corners and seek illegal profits, replacing the raw materials issued by the ordering organs with substandard products, or diverting the payment for other purposes, which has led to disputes and caused the ordering organs to be unwilling to allocate orders to certain private factories again. In addition, some ordering organs and private factories lack a spirit of equality and mutual benefit in their business dealings. In order to overcome the above shortcomings and improve the public-private relationship in processing and ordering, the preparatory committee of the Machine and Metal Industry Processing and Ordering Management Committee has decided to gradually investigate and study the business nature, production equipment, and technical conditions of each factory, so that each factory can accept processing and ordering in a more organized and planned manner, with quantities and qualities that meet the factory's production capacity and obtain reasonable profits; it will also review processing and ordering contracts and cost calculations, supervise and inspect the implementation of contracts between ordering organs and factories, and assist factories in improving their management and production technology to ensure that products have a certain quality and are completed on schedule.

　　工业局指导私营机器铁工业
    成立加工订货管委会筹备会
    【京市新闻处讯】京市工业局为改进私营机器铁工业与国家机关加工订货中的公私关系，经市财经委员会调整工商业工作组的协助，于本月十一日领导该业成立了加工订货管理委员会筹备委员会。参加这一机构的除工业局、机器冶制同业公会外，还有铁工业工会。
    京市解放后，机器铁工业的大中型工厂，大部是给政府和公营企业承做加工订货，对完成国家机关的生产任务起着一定作用，工厂本身也因此获得维持或发展。但由于缺乏统筹管理，在加工订货过程中曾发生了不少缺点：有时工厂承做的订货数量、质量与自己生产能力并不适合，影响了产品质量、规格和拖延了完成任务的时间；有时因国家机关成本计算不精确，各机关订货利润未能一致，悬殊很多，利润过高则国家机关受到损失，过低则不能照顾到工厂生产的合理利润；还有少数工厂则偷工减料牟取非法利润，把订货机关发给的原料换用次品，或把订款移作别用，以致引起纠纷，并造成订货机关对某些私营工厂不愿再分配订货的现象。此外，也有个别订货机关和私营工厂业务往来时缺乏平等、两利的精神。为了克服上述缺点，搞好加工订货中的公私关系，机器铁路工业加工订货管理委员会筹委曾决定将逐步调查研究各厂业务性质、生产设备、技术条件，使各厂能比较有组织有计划地接受加工订货，数量质量符合工厂生产能力，获得合理利润；并审核加工订货合同及成本计算，监督检查订货机关与工厂执行合同的情况，协助各厂改进经营及生产技术，以保证产品有一定质量，如期完成任务。
