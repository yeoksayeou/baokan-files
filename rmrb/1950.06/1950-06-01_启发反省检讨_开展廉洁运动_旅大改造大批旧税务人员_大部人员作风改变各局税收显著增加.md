Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 30th—The tax authorities in various parts of the Lüda district have reformed a large number of former tax officials, enabling them to establish a working style of integrity and public service. When the tax authorities in Lüda were first established in 1946, most of the tax officials were from the puppet Manchukuo regime, and some were former employees recruited through examinations, in addition to a small number of young students who had newly joined the work. Although most of these people had received short-term education, they still lacked a clear understanding of the policies of the People's Government and retained undesirable old habits. According to materials from their later self-reflections, more than 80 percent had engaged in corrupt practices. They believed that entertaining and gifting by industrial and commercial households, or buying things from them on credit, or asking them to buy cheap things, were all "legitimate" and "human interactions." As a result, phenomena such as corruption, tax evasion, and tax leakage occurred continuously. For example, two tax inspectors from the Second Tax Sub-bureau of Dalian City in the past had never investigated the cellar accounts of distilleries that often treated them to meals and gave them things during ten months of tax inspections. When checking industrial and commercial taxes, these tax officials often only calculated based on what was written in the accounts of industrial and commercial households, or levied taxes based on the numbers reported by industrial and commercial households themselves, rarely conducting serious inspections and verifications. Some even colluded with private merchants to shield them from tax evasion. For example, Luan Yuhai of the First Tax Sub-bureau of Dalian City had shielded merchants from tax evasion and embezzled a total of over one million Kuantung currency.

In response to these serious phenomena, various bureaus began to conduct comprehensive assessments of tax officials in 1947. They constantly held life review meetings to encourage them to reflect, examine their work style and thinking, and educate them at any time according to their specific circumstances. In November 1948, a clean governance campaign was launched. First, they conducted current affairs learning to educate them to establish the idea of serving the people. The campaign emphasized more rewards and fewer punishments. Those who had been corrupt in the past were given leniency if they could thoroughly reflect and allowed to keep their jobs. Those who were exposed by others without reflecting themselves were punished as appropriate. After a month of the clean governance campaign, most of the old tax personnel realized that eating meals from industrial and commercial households, accepting bribes from industrial and commercial households, and owing debts to industrial and commercial households were all illegal behaviors. As a result, they partially changed their past working attitude of "muddling through" and "making money". Many people who had engaged in corrupt practices seriously confessed and reflected and resolved not to smoke a single cigarette or drink a sip of tea from industrial and commercial households in the future. Many people handed over materials on tax evasion they had discovered in the past but had not reported. Since then, when some private merchants tried to evade taxes and bribe tax officials, tax officials mostly refused on the spot and reported to their superiors. A large number of honest tax officials have emerged in various bureaus.

In 1949, in order to further eliminate corruption among staff and improve work efficiency, various bureaus launched a model merit-making movement for integrity and public service on the basis of the clean governance campaign. After these two campaigns and the regular education of former tax officials, the former tax officials in Lüda have basically changed their old working style, strengthened their sense of responsibility, and most can complete or exceed the tax revenue tasks on schedule. The First Tax Sub-bureau increased its income tax collection in the second half of 1949 by about 70 percent compared to the first half. The work of other bureaus has also improved significantly.

　　启发反省检讨·开展廉洁运动
    旅大改造大批旧税务人员
    大部人员作风改变各局税收显著增加
    【新华社大连三十日电】旅大区各地税务机关改造了大批旧税务人员，使之树立了廉洁奉公的工作作风。一九四六年旅大各地税务机关初成立时，税务人员中除少数是新参加工作的青年学生外，大部是伪满的，部分是招考的旧职员。这些人大部虽已受过短期教育，但对人民政府的政策仍缺乏明确认识，保留着不良的旧作风。根据他们后来反省的材料：百分之八十以上，曾犯有贪污行为。他们认为工商户请客、送礼或向工商户赊账以及托工商户买便宜东西等都是“合法”的，是“人情来往”。因此贪污、偷税和漏税等现象不断发生。如大连市第二税务分局过去的两个查税员，因为酿酒业的烧锅常请他们吃饭，给他们送东西，所以查了十个月的税，一向没有查过烧酒的窖账。在查工商业税时，这些税务人员也往往只根据工商户账上写的来计算，或根据工商户自报的数目来课征，很少加以认真检查和核算，有的甚至和私商勾结，包庇其偷税。如大连市第一税务分局栾玉海，即曾包庇商人偷税及贪污共达关东币百余万元。
    针对这些严重现象，各局在一九四七年开始对税务人员进行全面考核。平时不断召开生活检讨会，启发他们进行反省，检查工作作风和思想，根据各人具体情况随时进行教育。一九四八年十一月更展开了廉洁运动，首先进行了时事学习，教育他们建立为人民服务的思想；在运动中强调多奖励、少处罚，过去贪污者只要能够彻底反省，一律留职宽大处理；对于自己不反省而被别人揭发者则酌情予以惩处。经过一个月的廉洁运动，旧税收人员大多数已认识到吃工商户的饭、收工商户的贿赂、赊欠工商户的账，都是不法行为，因而部分地改变了过去的“混事”和“弄钱”的工作态度。不少有过贪污行为的人认真地进行了坦白反省，并决心在以后不吸工商户一枝烟、不喝一口茶。很多人交出过去发现偷税而未上报的材料。此后，当有的私商企图偷税而向税务人员进行贿赂时，税务人员大都当场予以拒绝，并向上级报告。各局均涌现出大批廉洁的税务人员。
    一九四九年，为了进一步肃清工作人员的贪污现象和提高工作效率，各局在廉洁运动的基础上又展开了廉洁奉公的模范立功运动。经过这两个运动及对旧税务人员的经常教育，目前旅大旧税务人员基本上已经改变了旧的工作作风，加强了责任心，大部都能按期完成或超过税收任务。第一税务分局在一九四九年下半年稽征所得税时，比上半年增加了约百分之七十。其他各局的工作亦有显著提高。
