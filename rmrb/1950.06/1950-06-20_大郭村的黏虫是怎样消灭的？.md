How Was the Armyworm Pest Eliminated in Daguo Village?
Zhao Zhenzhi

I. A Small Example of the Seriousness of the Armyworm

On July 10th last year, armyworms began to appear on the sweet wormwood in the wasteland within the Daguo Village airfield in Shijiazhuang. The local farmers had no experience with armyworms and did not pay attention. By the 12th, the sweet wormwood was eaten bare, and the armyworms began to spread to the crops in the fields. By the 13th, all 1,200 mu of cultivated land in the airfield had suffered varying degrees of armyworm infestation. The wormwood was eaten bare in three to five days, the beans were reduced to just veins in a day or two, and the sweet potato vines were left as bare strands lying stiffly on the ground. There were one or two dozen armyworms on a single wormwood stalk, and it looked less like wormwood and more like a rope made of armyworms!

The black bean field of Hao Rong in the southeast of the airfield was only discovered to have armyworms on the morning of the 12th, but when checked on the morning of the 13th, it had been completely eaten. The black beans in Hao San's intercropped sorghum and black bean field were also eaten within the same time frame (the sorghum was not affected). Chen Guihong's four mu sweet potato field in the center of the airfield was also eaten bare in just one day and night. In the southeast of the airfield, some armyworms had already started to crawl towards the ditches outside the airfield. If no prevention and control measures were taken, this disaster would spread and cause extreme hardship to the farmers. Upon discovering this serious situation, the leadership immediately seized the time and quickly mobilized the masses to catch and kill the armyworms. After a concentrated effort on the 14th and 15th, the armyworms in the entire airfield were eliminated, and their spread was stopped.

II. The Pattern and Habits of Armyworm Occurrence

The occurrence and development of armyworms follow a certain pattern. We must master this pattern to inspect in time, prevent the occurrence of armyworms, treat the symptoms, effectively eliminate armyworms, and prevent them from becoming a disaster.

1.  Time of Occurrence: Often around the beginning of autumn, but possibly earlier. Last year, it occurred a week before the beginning of autumn, which was exactly the season when early rice began to head.

2.  Environment of Occurrence: Armyworms are most likely to occur in hot and humid climates with poor air circulation. Last year, the armyworms occurred after three days and three nights of heavy rain following a prolonged drought. After the rain stopped, the soil was not only moist, but the climate was also hot and humid.

3.  They are prone to occur in black soil, low-lying and damp areas, and windy mountain roots.

4.  It is also related to the growth of crops: Armyworms are more likely to occur when crops grow particularly densely. In the past, in Shuyangzhuang in Tangxian, Cuiguanzhuang in Xushui, and Fangshunqiao in Mancheng, the crops grew exceptionally well. According to experienced farmers, it was unprecedented in the past decade, so armyworms were particularly numerous there.

5.  Armyworms like to eat millet, foxtail millet, and other gramineous plants. For the same crop, plants with more leaves and more tender leaves are more likely to become targets of armyworm attacks. "811 Millet" and "Drought-Resistant Millet" are extremely susceptible to armyworm damage, while the "Huangmaoshan" and "Daluochui" varieties of millet are more resistant to armyworms and are less likely to be attacked.

In addition to understanding the patterns of armyworm occurrence, it is also necessary to clearly understand the habits of armyworms. According to our understanding, armyworms have the following habits:

1.  Suddenness: The occurrence and elimination of armyworms seem sudden on the surface. "They come quickly and go quickly." Last year was like this: at the end of July, reports of armyworm occurrences in various counties came in thick and fast, and after the summer heat, news of the elimination of armyworms also followed one after another.

2.  Collectivity: The occurrence of armyworms is not scattered and isolated; it is gregarious and concentrated. When a piece of farmland is eaten bare, the armyworms in this land leave at the same time and move to another piece of land. Their actions are collective.

3.  Light Aversion: Armyworms are afraid of strong sunlight, so they often hide under leaves, are active at night, and are active on cloudy days; they are inactive on sunny days.

4.  Feigned Death: When armyworms encounter vibration, they pretend to be dead and curl up motionless.

IV. Effective Methods for Preventing and Controlling Armyworms

1.  Egg Collection: The production committee member of Xiheishan Village in the first district of Xushui is an experienced old farmer. While hoeing the fields, he discovered gray moths flying around in the rice fields, laying eggs on the tips of the rice leaves. Afterwards, the leaves turned yellow and curled up. He cut off the leaves with eggs (the insect eggs are mostly laid on the three or four leaves at the very tip) and took them back to burn or bury them. When armyworms occurred, his land suffered very little damage. Later, others also learned his method, so the farmland near him was not severely damaged.

2.  Digging Ditches: When large groups of armyworms occur, dig blocking ditches one foot deep and half a foot wide around the infested land. The ditch walls should be smooth, the ditch should be narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, and a small round pit with the same diameter as the bottom of the ditch can be dug every seven or eight feet along the bottom of the ditch. The armyworms that crawl down cannot crawl out, some are dried to death by the sun, some starve to death, and some have nowhere to escape and gather in the small pits, or they are swept into the small pits and collectively smashed to death.

3.  Pushing the Armyworm Cart: The armyworm cart is simple to make: two wooden handles, about five feet long, a small wooden wheel, seven inches in diameter and two inches wide. The wheel should be octagonal and not smooth and round, so that it is easy to vibrate. A mat or cloth bag is nailed in the middle. It is especially good to split an oil drum diagonally into two scoop shapes, nail them in the middle, tie the rope to the handles and put it on the shoulders, and hold two wooden sticks in the hands, walking along the ridges and hitting the armyworms, which fall into the iron scoops. The cart vibrates as it moves, the armyworms cannot climb up, and a moderately sized round stone is placed inside, which also rolls with the vibration of the cart and smashes the armyworms to death. When the dead armyworms are full, they are poured out.

4.  Using the Armyworm Catching Scoop to Catch and Kill: Cut an oil drum in half, put the two halves together to make a scoop more than two feet long, circle it with an elm branch or a thin manure basket handle, tie the handle tightly around the waist, and then tie a rope to the front end of the scoop and hang it on the neck. Each hand holds a small stick, walks forward, and catches and kills the armyworms. In some places, to avoid standing water, many small holes are drilled in the middle of the scoop with a sharp awl, and in some places, cloth bags are tied on top. This thing is simple to make and can be used even when the ground is wet from rain.

In addition, the prevention and control of armyworms must be done in a timely manner; once the opportunity is lost, it cannot be recovered. At the same time, for concentrated prevention and control, it is necessary to organize the masses, but judging from experience: when organizing the masses, the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit cannot be violated. When the masses themselves combine with people who are not relatives but neighbors and have the same interests, it can have a great effect and prevent the abuses of indifference and wasting crops.

### 大郭村的黏虫是怎样消灭的？

　　大郭村的黏虫是怎样消灭的？
    赵真之
    一、黏虫严重性的一个小例子
    去年七月十日，石家庄大郭村飞机场内荒地里的香蒿上开始发生黏虫，当地农民没有发生黏虫的经验，未曾注意到，十二日香蒿吃光了，黏虫开始蔓延到田苗上去。到十三日，场内的一千二百亩耕地都遭受到黏虫不同程度的侵袭。蒿子经三五日被吃成光秆，豆子一两天的功夫被吃得只剩下叶脉，甘藷只剩下一条一条的光蔓子僵卧在地里，一根蒿子上就有一二十条黏虫，看来不像蒿子，简直变成了黏虫结成的一条绳子！
    场东南郝荣的一块黑豆地，十二日上午刚刚发现黏虫，十三日上午检查时便全部被吃光；郝三的一块高粱黑豆间作地里的黑豆也是在这同一时间内被吃掉（高粱未被害），场中央陈贵红一块四亩地的甘藷也是一昼夜的时间被吃得一叶不存。在场的东南方已有一部分向场的壕沟外爬行，假如再不防治，眼看这灾害要蔓延开来，将给农民以极惨重的打击。领导上发现此严重事实，当即抓紧时间，迅速地发动群众捕打，经过十四、十五两天的突击，才消灭了全场的黏虫，阻遏了它的蔓延。
    二、黏虫发生的规律和它的习性
    黏虫的发生与发展是有一定规律的。我们必须掌握这一规律，才能及时检查，防止黏虫的发生，对症下药，有效地除灭黏虫，使其不致成灾。
    １、发生的时间：往往在立秋的前后，也可能早一些，去年就是在立秋前的一个星期发生的，那正是早谷开始吐穗的季节。
    ２、发生的环境：在气候闷热，地面潮湿，空气不流通的情形下，黏虫最容易发生，去年黏虫发生的时间是在久旱之后下了三天三夜的大雨的时候。雨后遽晴，不但土壤潮湿，而且气候闷热。
    ３、容易发生的地方是黑土地，低湿下洼地和山根窝风之处。
    ４、与作物的生长情形也有关系：在作物生长特别茂密的状况下，黏虫便容易发生。唐县的束杨庄，徐水的崔官庄，满城的方顺桥，在前年，庄稼生长得特别好，据有经验的老农说，那是十年来所未见过的，因而黏虫在那里就特别多。
    ５、黏虫喜欢吃的是谷子、黍子，以及其他的禾本科植物。同是一样作物，叶多而柔嫩的作物，便有更多的机会成为黏虫袭击的对象。像“八一一谷”、“抗旱谷”极易受到黏虫的迫害，而“黄毛山”、“打锣锤”两个品种的谷子抗黏虫的力量就大一些，不易受到黏虫的袭击。
    除了了解黏虫的发生规律，还要确切地明了黏虫的习性。据了解，黏虫有以下的几种习性：
    １、突然性：黏虫的发生和消灭，表面看是突然的。“其来也速，其去也骤，”去年便是这样，七月底各县黏虫发生的报告纷至沓来，去暑后黏虫消灭的消息，也是接踵而至的。
    ２、集体性：黏虫的发生不是散漫的，分离的；而是群聚的，集中的。当一块庄稼被吃光后，这地里的黏虫是同时离开而走到另一块地里，它们的行动是集体性的。
    ３、畏光性：黏虫怕强烈的日光，因而它经常藏在叶底，夜间活动，阴天活动；晴明的天气里，它是没有活动的。
    ４、伪死性：黏虫一遇到震动，便要装死，蜷伏不动。
    四、防治黏虫的有效方法。
    １、采卵：徐水一区西黑山村的生产委员是一个有经验的老农，在锄地时发现有灰色蛾子在稻田地里乱飞，在稻叶尖上下卵，以后叶子就发黄而蜷曲，他将有卵的叶子（虫卵多下在最尖端的三、四个叶子上）剪下取回烧掉或埋掉。在黏虫发生时，他的地受害特别少。以后别人也学他的办法，于是他的附近农地，便没有受到大害。
    ２、挖沟：黏虫大群发生的时候，在生黏虫的地周围掘成深一尺宽半尺的封锁沟，沟壁要光滑，沟要上窄下宽，沟底每隔七、八尺远可以挖一个直径和沟底宽一样的圆小坑，黏虫爬下去便爬不出来，有的被日光晒死，有的饿死，有的无处逃避，群聚到小坑中，或者把它们扫到小坑中，集体砸死。
    ３、推黏虫车：黏虫车制法很简单，两个木把，长五尺左右，一个小木轮，直径七寸，宽二寸，轮要八棱，不要滑圆，这样易于震动。中间钉上席子或布兜，尤其好的是把洋铁桶从横断面斜劈为两个簸箕形，钉在中间，把上拴上绳子套在肩上，手拿两根木棍，顺着地垅随走随打，黏虫便掉入铁簸箕中，车一壁走一壁震动，黏虫不能爬上来，里面放入一块大小适度的圆石头，也随着车子的震动而滚动，便把黏虫砸死，死黏虫满了再倒出来。
    ４、使用黏虫圃图捕打：把一个洋油筒切成两半，对在一起，制成二尺多长的圃图，用一个榆树枝条或粪筐稀柄圈起来，柄部紧捆于腰间，再用一条绳子将圃图的前端拴住，搁在脖颈上，双手各持一小棍，一面往前走，一面捕打，有的地方为避免存水，在圃图中间用尖锥钻成许多小孔，有的地方用布兜子绑在上面。这种东西简单易做，雨天地湿的情形下也能用。
    此外，防治黏虫必须抓紧时间，一失时机即不可收拾。同时为突击防治，必须组织群众，但从经验上判断：在组织群众时是不能违反自愿两利的原则的。由群众自己去结合非亲即邻的利害相同的人，组织起来，便能发生大效果，而不至有漠不关心，糟蹋庄稼的流弊。
