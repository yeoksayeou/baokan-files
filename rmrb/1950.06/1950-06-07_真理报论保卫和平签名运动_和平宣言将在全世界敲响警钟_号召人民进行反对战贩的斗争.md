Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 6th: *Pravda*'s diplomatic commentator, Malinin, published a commentary on the 4th, stating that the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in London announced that over 100 million people have already signed the Peace Declaration. This demonstrates that all honest and good people not only should, but are also able to unite to fight to prevent the crisis of a new war.

Malinin pointed out that the common program uniting all supporters of peace—the Peace Declaration—is fully in line with the basic principles of the United Nations. Therefore, the larger the scale of the worldwide peace movement, the more effective the activities of the United Nations organization—activities aimed at safeguarding peace—will be. However, the American imperialists believe that the United Nations is an obstacle on their path to international adventurism, and therefore they have always attempted to abolish the United Nations and replace it with a substitute under their arbitrary control. This substitute may be cloaked in the notorious "European Federation," or it may appear in the form of the infamous "Atlantic Alliance."

It should be remembered that the imperialist camp and its running dogs are responding to the victory of the peace movement by strengthening their work of undermining the peace movement. The splitting activities of the right-wing Social Democratic leaders are clear evidence of this. Recently, the International Socialist Committee (the international center of the right-wing Social Democrats) held a meeting in Copenhagen. All the attempts of the right-wing Social Democratic chieftains are aimed at undermining the movement to ban atomic weapons. This is the policy of the British Labour Party leaders, the supporters of the French Blum, the followers of the West German Schumacher, the Italian Saragat group, and the right-wing Social Democrats of Sweden and Finland. We must constantly expose the conspiracies of this group in order to eliminate their deceptive influence on the people.

Malinin concluded by pointing out that no one can remain neutral in the struggle for peace. Supporters of peace are conducting a nationwide referendum. The Peace Declaration will become an alarm bell ringing throughout the world, calling on the people of the world to struggle against the war profiteers.

    和平宣言将在全世界敲响警钟  号召人民进行反对战贩的斗争
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报外交评论员马里宁于四日发表评论说：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局伦敦会议宣布，已经有一亿以上的人民在和平宣言上签了名。这表明了：一切正直的善良的人民，不但应该，而且能够团结起来为防止新战争的危机而斗争的。
    马里宁指出：团结一切和平拥护者的共同纲领——和平宣言，是与联合国的基本原则完全符合的。因此，全世界和平运动的规模越大，则联合国组织的活动——旨在保障和平的活动——就能越加有效。而美帝国主义者则认为，联合国是他们进行国际冒险的道路上的障碍，因而它始终企图取消联合国，并代之以在其专横控制下的代用品。这种代用品可能披上臭名远扬的“欧洲联邦”的外衣，也可能以声名狼藉的“大西洋联盟”的形式出现。
    应该记住一点：帝国主义阵营及其走狗是以加强其阴谋破坏和平运动的工作，来回答和平运动的胜利的。右翼社会党领袖的分裂活动，就是明证。最近，国际社会党委员会会议（右翼社会党的国际中心）在哥本哈根举行会议。右翼社会党头目们的一切企图，都以破坏要求禁止原子武器的运动为其鹄的。这就是英国的工党领袖、法国勃鲁姆的支持者、西德舒马赫的追随者、意大利的萨拉盖特集团和瑞典与芬兰的右翼社会民主党人的方针。我们必须经常揭露这群人的阴谋，以消灭他们对人民的欺骗影响。
    马里宁最后指出：没有人能在争取和平的斗争中保持中立。和平拥护者正在进行全民表决。和平宣言将成为在全世界各地敲响的警钟，号召全世界人民进行反对战争贩子的斗争。
