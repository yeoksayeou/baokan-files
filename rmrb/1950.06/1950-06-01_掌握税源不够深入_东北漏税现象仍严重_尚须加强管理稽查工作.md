Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th. Although tax collection work in Northeast China has made great achievements in the past, tax evasion is still very serious due to the insufficient grasp of tax sources by the tax authorities of major cities. At the same time, due to the lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall situation of industrial and commercial operators, there is a phenomenon of uneven tax burdens between small and medium-sized cities and large cities, with the tax burden in large cities being far lighter than that in small and medium-sized cities.

According to statistics from tax bureaus throughout Northeast China, a total of 33,775 cases of tax evasion of indirect taxes were investigated and dealt with last year, with a total fine of 73.6 billion yuan (Northeast currency). Of course, many cases have not yet been uncovered. At present, the false accounts discovered by various provinces and cities generally account for more than 60 percent of the total number of industrial households, with the highest concealed figures reaching twenty times the actual amount, and the lowest being about one time. Before the implementation of the invoice system in the collective market of Harbin, the turnover for half a month was 2.7 billion yuan. After the implementation of the invoice system, with goods sold and revenue collected by dedicated personnel and supervised by assigned staff, the turnover increased to 4.9 billion yuan. This fact proves that before the implementation of management, the merchants in the market concealed slightly less than 47 percent of the total turnover.

The phenomenon of unbalanced burden between large cities and small and medium-sized cities exists. Taking Shenyang City and Nehe County as examples, Shenyang has 29,340 industrial and commercial households, with industrial and commercial income tax of 183.2 billion yuan, averaging 6.24 million yuan per household. Nehe County has 1,170 industrial and commercial households, with tax revenue of 7.5 billion yuan, averaging 6.41 million yuan per household. The burden per household in Shenyang City is 170,000 yuan lower than in Nehe County, but Nehe merchants do not consider the tax burden to be heavy.

The aforementioned shortcomings have attracted the attention of the Northeast tax authorities. At the first Northeast Regional Tax Model Workers Conference held in late April and early May, the work experience of various regions was summarized, and new working methods were exchanged. The meeting pointed out that, according to the nature of tax collection work and the current tax collection situation, it is necessary to strengthen the management and inspection of taxpayers, and establish a special zone responsibility system. Because the methods of tax evasion by industrial and commercial households are becoming more cunning than before, the struggle to break through false accounts is becoming increasingly complex. The meeting unanimously agreed that in the future, the internal organization of the tax bureau should be improved, and a smuggling suppression network and informant network should be established, and workers and shop assistants should be mobilized to participate in this mass smuggling suppression movement to cooperate with tax management and inspection work, expand tax sources, and increase income.

### 掌握税源不够深入  东北漏税现象仍严重  尚须加强管理稽查工作

　　掌握税源不够深入
    东北漏税现象仍严重
    尚须加强管理稽查工作
    【新华社沈阳三十日电】东北税收工作过去虽曾有了很大的成绩，但由于各大城市的税务机关对税源掌握得还不够，偷税漏税的现象仍很严重。同时，由于对工商业者的全盘真实情况了解不够，中小城市与大城市之间工商业的税收负担也发生了畸重畸轻的现象，大城市的税收远较中小城市为轻。
    据全东北各税局统计，去年全年共查获偷漏间接税案件三万三千七百七十五起，共计罚款七百三十六亿元（东北币，下同）。未经查出的，当然还是很多的。目前各省、市所查出的假账，一般皆占全工业户数的百分之六十以上，隐瞒数字最高的竟达二十倍，最低的亦在一倍左右。哈尔滨市集体商场在实行发货票制以前的半个月营业额为二十七亿元；实行发货票制后，货物售出由专人统一收款，并派员监督，营业额即增至四十九亿元。这一事实证明在未实行管理前，该商场商人即隐瞒了全部营业额的百分之四十七弱。
    大城市与中小城市的负担不平衡现象是存在的。以沈阳市与讷河县为例，沈阳工商业有二万九千三百四十户，工商所得税为一千八百三十二亿元，每户平均六百二十四万元。讷河县工商业为一千一百七十户，税收七十五亿元，每户平均六百四十一万元。每户负担额沈阳市低于讷河十七万元，但讷河商人并不认为税重。
    上述缺点，已引起东北税务当局的注意，四月底五月初召开的东北区首届税务模范工作者大会上，曾总结了各地工作经验，并交流新的工作方法。会议指出：根据税收工作的性质及目前税收工作情况，必须加强对纳税商户的管理与稽查，建立专区专责制办法。由于工商户逃税的偷漏方法较以前更为狡猾，突破假账的斗争日见复杂化。会上一致认为：今后应健全税局内部组织，并建立缉私网、密报员网，发动工人、店员参加这一群众性的缉私运动，以配合纳税管理稽查工作，开拓税源，增加收入。
