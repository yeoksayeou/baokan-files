Regarding the Opening of Nurseries: Several Questions
Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau Answers Reader Questions

To the Editor:

I intend to establish a nursery in Beijing, but there are several questions I am not clear about. Please answer them:

1.  Which agency should I register with first, and is a permit required?
2.  How many private nurseries are there in Beijing, and what is the general situation?
3.  Is the monthly nursery fee determined by myself, or by the government? What are the highest and lowest fees for other nurseries in this city?

        Bao Ying

To Comrade Bao Ying:

Regarding the procedures for opening a nursery, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau has replied as follows:

Those who wish to establish a nursery in Beijing should first submit their articles of association and plans to the local Civil Affairs Bureau for registration. Once approved, they will be allowed to open. There are currently fourteen private nurseries in Beijing. The fee standards for each nursery are determined independently based on their respective financial situations. Currently, the highest nursery fee in the city is 200 jin of millet (full-time care including clothing), and the lowest is 120 jin of millet (full-time care excluding clothing). The age of the children admitted can be divided into infants and young children. Admission methods can be determined independently based on each nursery's economic situation, technology, and equipment (generally, from two to six years old is most common).

　　关于开办托儿所的几个问题
    京市民政局答读者问编辑同志：
    本人拟在京市设立一托儿所，但有几个问题不甚了解，请你们解答：
    一、须先向何机关登记，是否需要许可执照？
    二、私人设立的托儿所，京市有若干？一般情形如何？
    三、每月托儿费用，是自行规定，抑由政府规定？本市其他托儿所，最高与最低费用各若干？
            保婴保婴同志：
    关于开办托儿所的手续问题，经北京市人民政府民政局答复如下：
    欲在京设立托儿所者，应先将组织章程与进行计划向当地民政局申请备案。经审核合格后，即准予开办。京市私立托儿所现有十四处。各托儿所的收费标准是按照各所经济情况自行规定。目前本市托儿所收费最高为二百斤小米（全托管穿），最低为一二○斤小米（全托不管穿）。托儿年龄可分乳儿、幼儿二种。收容办法可根据各所经济、技术、设备等情况自行规定（一般是由二岁至六岁为多）。
