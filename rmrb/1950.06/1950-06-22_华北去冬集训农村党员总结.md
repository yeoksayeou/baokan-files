　　Summary of Winter Training for Rural Party Members in North China
　　Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
　　In October 1949, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a large number of instructions on training rural party member cadres, which generally aroused the attention of party committees in various regions. With the exception of Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan, which were unable to hold large-scale training sessions due to special circumstances, most other provinces convened special meetings, formulated training plans, and compiled teaching materials. Shanxi also trained lecturers at the prefectural committee level. In most counties, the county committee took charge of research and county committee members lectured personally; some counties also selected district cadres to participate in the study as learning backbones.

　　From November of last year to the end of March this year, generally three to five training sessions were held, each lasting about ten days to half a month. Approximately 90% of the branches in Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Pingyuan provinces participated in the training (disaster areas did not hold training sessions). Some non-party members also participated in this training. According to incomplete statistics (statistics from various provinces are incomplete, with only forty-three counties and two cities in Shanxi providing statistics), over 220,000 party members have been trained. Many regions simultaneously conducted transmission and universal training based on the intensive training, with good results.

　　From the ideological situation revealed in the intensive training, as estimated in the instructions of the North China Bureau, the following existed without exception in all provinces among rural party members: First, they believed that the revolution had already succeeded and wanted to take a break. Party members in Taihang Mountain said: "A golden queen (referring to cornbread made from Golden Queen corn) for breakfast, a 169 (referring to wheat flour from 169 wheat) for lunch, and a 'cut hair head' (taking a woman who has had her hair cut as a wife) for the evening, any more work than that is over fulfilling the task." They also believed that doing work meant suffering from three sides: not completing the task meant suffering from the superiors; offending the masses meant suffering from the masses; and delaying production meant suffering from the wife. Second, it was impossible to eliminate the masses' ideological concerns about being afraid of standing out, being said to be rich, being struggled against again, and being "communized" (i.e., being afraid of eating from the big pot). Some party member cadres themselves also had agricultural socialist ideas and believed that farmers could produce on their own, without the need for leadership, or said that leading production was not revolutionary and were unwilling to lead. In checking work style, ordinary party members recognized that commandism was a bad behavior that alienated them from the masses, but felt distressed because the tasks were heavy and urgent, and the superiors did not provide many solutions. These ideas all showed that after the end of the war and the completion of land reform, some confusion had arisen among rural party members in North China regarding the future of the revolution. If this was not resolved in a timely manner, it would seriously hinder the progress of the party, especially affecting rural production.

　　In response to the above situation, various regions, according to the educational content instructed by the North China Bureau, first explained that the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries had not been completely eliminated, the land reform in the vast new areas of the country had not yet been carried out, and imperialism still existed, our revolution was only "the first step in a long march"; they briefly explained the laws of labor creating the world and social development, pointing out that ultimately a happy communist society must be achieved. After inspiring the party members to strive for the far-reaching goal of realizing communism, the focus of education was then directed towards the direction of production and policies of the New Democratic society. In particular, the issues of getting rich through hard work, production belonging to oneself, and guaranteeing private property rights in land were clarified; it was explained that revolution was for the development of production, production must have leadership, and leading the masses to organize and develop production was concrete revolutionary work, etc. Chahar Province also coordinated with the province-wide branch award movement, pointing out that all model branches were those that actively led production and had a good work style, thereby proving the importance of leading production and explaining that only by following the mass line could tasks be completed well.

　　The trained party members were generally satisfied with the above-mentioned teaching content, felt it was new, and could solve problems, believing that it was the first time they had heard it since joining the party. Many comrades were originally afraid of being "rectified" in the intensive training, afraid of being assigned tasks, and unwilling to be trained, but after listening to the lectures, they turned to being happy to be trained. Some were unwilling to come in the first phase, but automatically requested to come in the second phase. Some were originally afraid of delaying work, but later were afraid of missing classes, and did not want to go back to rest even when they were sick; or did not want to go home even when their families came to find them. The high level of learning enthusiasm was rarely seen before.

　　After training, ordinary party members have generally improved ideologically. Party members who have been trained in various places generally reported: "In the past, we only said that Japan was defeated, Chiang Kai-shek was overthrown, and the land was divided equally, that was considered the revolution was successful: who knew that we would still have to build such a good society!" This broke the "having enough to eat, wear, and a wife" mentality of being satisfied with the status quo and not seeking progress. Some said: "The party's policy always rewards labor, how can it be called good for the able to support the lazy?" This greatly encouraged production enthusiasm and improved the consciousness and enthusiasm of work. After returning to the village, the trained party members first transmitted what they had learned to the branch, helped with universal training, and at the same time actively publicized production policies to the masses, organized and led the masses to carry out production. Party members in Changzhi, Shanxi, put forward the slogan of "leading production with production." After being trained, party members in Lujiazhuang organized more than 100 carts to engage in transportation, earning more than 100 stones of rice twice. After returning to the village after training, party members in Meijiacun, Luancheng, Hebei, publicized production to get rich to the masses, and the entire village has increased the purchase of 150 livestock since winter. After being trained, the deputy village head of Xinzhuang, Hua County, Pingyuan, dug out the grain buried for three years to purchase carts and farm tools, and publicized his transformation to the masses. Due to the influence of party members, the masses' production enthusiasm also became more active, the ideological concerns about being afraid of eating from the big pot have gradually been eliminated, and land prices have risen accordingly, which has been the case in Pingyuan and Hebei.

　　For several years, the old liberated areas of North China have used the slack winter season every year to conduct political and cultural education for the masses through winter schools, and at the same time to rectify branches and train party member cadres. This practice has invisibly become a system. Practical experience has proved that this system is completely necessary. According to reports from various places, the following points are worth noting in this training:

　　First, in this training, both party members and leading cadres unanimously felt that regular branch education was very insufficient. Many basic party knowledge was unknown to party members. Almost everything had to be explained from the beginning when lecturing, and often several questions were entangled together. Before one question was clarified, another unclear question would arise, making lecturing and acceptance difficult. After this training, the party members generally automatically improved party life and established a learning system. Branch party members were very satisfied with this. This proves that party members want to learn. And the leading agencies in various places have also stipulated that county and district committees should regularly give party classes to the branches. This is a very good phenomenon and must be adhered to. On the basis of regular education, focusing on the main ideological problems of branch party members, adopting the principle of being few but refined (only concentrate on explaining one or two main problems, too much cannot be accepted), holding intensive training once a year, this approach has a great effect. Some places do not conduct branch education usually, attempting to solve all problems in one rectification, experience has proved that this is not possible. And after the intensive training, it is still necessary to consolidate the results of the intensive training in regular branch education, so as not to let it be just a temporary excitement.

　　Second, some places still do not understand the importance of this regular intensive training of party member cadres, neither have they studied the instructions of the superiors well, nor are they willing to send strong cadres to lead this work, resulting in a waste of manpower and material resources, and the ideological problems of party members have not been resolved. Some places are only limited to the specific arrangements of winter work, simply criticizing some deviations in the work, lacking communist ideological education. Even if this is done well, it can only play a temporary and certain role in completing the current work tasks, but it still remains at the stage of "discussing matters on their own merits" and simply "teaching what to do," failing to improve the political and ideological level of party members, and the main ideological problems remain unresolved.

　　Third, most counties have mobilized party members to voluntarily enroll in school, and branch party members have helped each other to take care of families with difficulties, so they can study with peace of mind and full enthusiasm after enrollment. However, some counties have adopted the method of simply allocating numbers or designating training. Of course, party members should obey the party's designation for training. But the problem is that there is no in-depth mobilization, and the ideological situation of party members is not understood on weekdays, so that in some places party members delay resistance and do not come to training; some are forced to come, and there have also been cases of impersonation and desertion. The leading agency's adoption of simple and forced methods to mobilize party members for training will have a very bad effect on overcoming the commandism style of party members and should be taken as a warning!

　　Fourth, in this training, in terms of methods, generally three steps of lecturing, discussion, and answering questions were adopted. The students felt that they both solved problems and learned new knowledge, and gained a lot. After learning new knowledge to solve problems, they can not only improve their own ideological understanding, but also increase their persuasiveness to others, which is convenient for overcoming the commandism style. Because the commandism style is, on the one hand, the old social style of not having a mass viewpoint. In addition to conducting in-depth education on the mass viewpoint, it must also be strictly sanctioned in accordance with discipline and laws; on the other hand, party members themselves have weak working ability and no persuasive ability to the masses, and commandism errors often occur in urgent tasks. In this training, except for Chahar Province, which conducted a separate inspection on work style, other places did not particularly emphasize this issue. However, after the intensive training, party members generally made progress in work style, and the relationship between the party and the masses has improved. This is mainly because the awareness of party members has been improved, and their actions have influenced the masses. At the same time, party members have learned some things, so propaganda and explanation work among the masses has also been welcomed by the masses. For example, after returning to the village after training, party members in Zuoquan, Shanxi, gradually formed the practice of holding meetings of various systems or being invited to report to winter schools from sitting and chatting in the dining hall. In the past, the masses in Cheng Village, Qingfeng, Pingyuan, were most annoyed by meetings. This time, they listened to the trained party members for half the night and welcomed them to speak again.

　　Finally, the biggest shortcoming of this intensive training is the lack of unified teaching materials (errors have been found in almost all teaching materials compiled in various places). Except for Shanxi, the lecturers were not uniformly trained, so the lecturing methods were also inconsistent. The most important thing is that the leading ideology in various places is not unified. For example, there were many debates on the issue of future education in many places: some advocated lecturing, and some even advocated lecturing in detail; some advocated not lecturing. Generally, the training content originally instructed by the North China Bureau was followed, briefly lecturing on the prospects of socialism, pointing out the future of the revolution, and focusing on the direction of production and production policies of the New Democracy. The general effect of this lecture is good. However, some comrades in the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee have long disagreed with this policy of the North China Bureau in their thinking. They advocated detailed lectures on the specific circumstances of socialist society, the types and quantities of private property in collective farms, such as a few acres of vegetable garden and a few chickens, etc. Their reason is that party members and the masses want to get to the bottom of things, and it is not possible to not explain in detail. As a result of their lectures, rural party members, based on their own habits and understanding, were not only unable to understand for a while, but also led to more confused ideas. Some leading comrades did not guide the students' thinking to the correct direction in a timely manner, but mechanically believed that "the development and exposure of new confused understanding is necessary in order to accurately solve it." Everyone knows that future education is necessary, the inevitable law of social development must be explained, and the personal experience of rural party members has a large gap from socialism. If they are forced to talk about "specific circumstances," the result is as the summary of the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee said: "Most places are not deep enough in solving this problem." This affected the explanation of the most important and realistic direction of production and policies of the New Democracy. The ideas and practices of some comrades in the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, both in ideological understanding and specific methods, are worthy of being taken as a lesson by various places.

　　华北去冬集训农村党员总结
    中共中央华北局宣传部
    一九四九年十月，中共中央华北局发出了大量训练农村党员干部的指示，一般地引起了各地党委的重视。除内蒙、绥远因情况特殊未能大量举办外，其余各省大部召开了专门会议，制定了集训计划，编写了教材。山西还以地委为单位训练了讲课人员。大多数的县份，是县委会掌握研究，县委委员亲自讲课；有的县还抽调区干部参加学习，作为学习骨干。
    从去年十一月起到今年三月底止，一般举办了三期至五期的训练，每期十天至半月左右。冀、晋、察、平原四省参加集训的支部，约在百分之九十左右（灾区未举办）。这次集训也有部分非党员参加。据不完全统计（各省统计都不完全，山西只有四十三个县两个市的统计），受训党员已在二十二万人以上。不少地区，在集训的基础上同时进行了传授和普训，效果很好。
    从集训中暴露的思想情况来看，正如华北局指示中所估计的，在农村党员中各省无例外地存在着：一是认为革命已经成功，要求歇一歇。太行山党员说：“早饭一顿金皇后（指金皇后种的玉米面窝窝头），下午一顿一六九（指一六九种的麦面），晚上抱个剪发头（以剪发妇女为妻），再干就超过任务了。”并且认为干工作要受三面的气：完不成任务受上级的气；得罪群众受群众的气；耽误生产受老婆的气。二是无法消除群众怕冒尖，怕说富，怕再斗，怕“共产”（即怕吃大锅饭）的思想顾虑。有些党员干部自己也有农业社会主义思想，并且认为农民都会生产，用不着领导，或者说领导生产不是革命，不愿意领导。在检查作风中，一般党员认识了命令主义是脱离群众的恶劣行为，但认为任务重且急，上级给的办法不多，因而感到苦恼。这些思想，都说明华北农村党员在战争结束、土地改革完成之后，对于革命前途发生了某些迷惘。倘不及时予以解决，便会严重地障碍党的前进，特别是影响农村生产。
    针对上述情况，各地根据华北局指示的教育内容：首先说明国民党反动派残余尚未完全肃清，全国广大新区土地改革尚未进行，还有帝国主义存在，我们的革命还只是“万里长征走完了第一步”；扼要地讲解劳动创造世界及社会发展规律，指出最后一定要达到美满的共产主义社会。如此鼓舞起党员为实现共产主义的远大目标而奋斗的前进心之后，紧接着把教育重点引向新民主主义社会的生产方向和政策。特别讲清勤劳致富、生产归自己所有、保障私人财权地权等问题；说明革命是为发展生产，生产必须有领导，领导群众组织起来发展生产就是具体的革命工作等。察哈尔省并配合全省支部评奖运动，指出凡是模范支部都是积极领导生产而又作风好的，以此证明领导生产的重要性，并说明只有走群众路线才能很好的完成任务。
    对于上述讲解内容，受训党员普遍满意，觉着新鲜，并能解决问题，认为是入党以来第一次听到的。不少同志原来怕集训“挨整”，怕分配任务，不愿受训，听讲后转为乐于受训。有的第一期不愿来，第二期自动要求来。有的原来怕误工，后来怕误课，有病也不回去休养；或者家中有事来找也不愿回家。学习情绪之高，为前所少见。
    经过训练之后，一般党员在思想上都已提高了一步。各地受训党员普遍反映：“以前只说日本打倒了，蒋介石打垮了，土地也平分了，就算革命成功啦：谁知还要建设这么个好社会！”打破了“有吃有穿有老婆”满足现状、不求前进的思想。有的说：“党的政策啥时也是奖励劳动的，那还能叫好受家（指劳动好的人）养活懒汉？”这就大大鼓舞了生产情绪，提高了工作的自觉性和积极性。受训党员回村后，首先向支部进行传授，帮助普训，同时积极向群众宣传生产政策，组织并领导群众进行生产。山西党员提出“以生产领导生产”的口号。长治鹿家庄党员受训后，带头组织了一百多辆大车搞运输，两次赚米一百多石。河北栾城梅家村党员受训回村后，向群众宣传生产致富，全村冬季以来增买牲口一百五十头。平原滑县辛集副村长受训后，将埋存三年的粮食扒出来购置大车农具，并以自己的转变向群众进行宣传。由于党员的影响，群众的生产情绪也更积极起来，怕吃大锅饭的思想顾虑已逐渐消除，土地价格随之上升，平原、河北都有这种情形。
    几年以来，华北老区每年利用冬季农闲，一面通过冬学对群众进行政治的与文化的教育，一面进行整理支部训练党员干部，这种作法无形中已成为一种制度。实际经验证明这种制度是完全必要的。根据各地报告，这次集训有以下几点值得注意：
    第一、这次集训中，无论党员或领导干部，都一致感觉经常的支部教育非常不够。好多党的基本知识，党员都不知道。讲课时几乎什么都要从头讲起，而且常常几个问题纠缠在一起，这个问题还没说清，又引起另一个不明白的问题来，讲授与接受都感吃力。这次党员受训回去后，一般的都自动健全党的生活，建立学习制度。支部党员对此很满意。这证明党员是要求学习的。而各地领导机构也都规定了县、区定期给支部上党课。这是一种很好的现象，必须加以坚持。在经常进行教育的基础上，针对支部党员的主要思想问题，采取少而精的原则（只能集中力量讲一、二个主要问题，讲多了接受不了），每年集训一次，这样作法作用很大。有的地方平常不进行支部教育，企图在一次整训中解决一切问题，经验证明是不行的。而在集训之后，仍必须在经常的支部教育中把集训成绩巩固起来，以免热闹一阵就算完事。
    第二、有些地方还不懂得这种定期集训党员干部的重要性，既未很好的研究上级指示，也不肯派强的干部去领导这一工作，结果徒然浪费人力物力，党员的思想问题未能获得解决。有的地方只局限于冬季具体工作的布置，简单地批评了一些工作中的偏向，缺乏共产主义的思想教育。这样即使作的好，也只是对当前的工作任务完成上能起一时和一定程度的作用，但仍停留在“就事论事”和单纯“作啥教啥”的阶段上，未能把党员的政治思想水平提高一步，主要思想问题仍未解决。
    第三、大部县份作到动员党员使其自愿入学，家庭有困难的，支部党员互助照管，因之入学后学习安心，情绪饱满。但有部分县采用简单分配数目或指名受训的办法。当然党指定党员受训，党员应该服从。但问题在于没有深入动员，平日不了解党员思想情况，以致有的地方党员拖延抵抗，不来受训；有的被迫而来，也发生了冒名顶替和开小差的现象。领导机关调党员受训，采用简单和强迫的办法，对于克服党员强迫命令作风，将起一种很坏的作用，应引以为警惕！
    第四、这次集训，在方法上，一般采取了讲授、讨论与解答问题三个步骤，学员感觉既解决问题，又学得新的知识，收获很大。他们学得了解决问题的新知识后，不仅能提高自己的思想认识，而且增加了对别人的说服力，便于克服强迫命令作风。因为命令主义作风，一方面是没有群众观点的旧社会作风，除了深入进行群众观点的教育外，还必须根据纪律法令严格予以制裁；另一方面党员自己工作能力弱，对群众无说服能力，往往在任务紧急的情况下，发生命令主义的错误。这次集训中，除察哈尔省曾单独进行关于作风的检查外，其他各地并未特别强调这个问题。但是集训后，党员在作风上一般地都有进步，党群关系有了改进。这主要是由于党员觉悟提高，以自己的行动影响了群众。同时，党员学得了一些东西，因而在群众中进行宣传解释工作，也受到群众的欢迎。如山西左权党员受训回村后，由饭场闲坐漫谈，逐渐形成召开各系统会议或被邀请到冬学报告。平原清丰程庄群众过去最厌烦开会，这次听受训党员讲了半夜，还欢迎他们再讲。
    最后，这次集训最大的缺点，是没有统一的教材（各地编的教材几乎都发现了错误）。除山西外，讲课的人没有统一受训，因之讲法也不一致。其中最主要的，还是各地领导思想上不统一。比如前途教育的问题，好多地方都发生了争论：有的主张讲，有的还主张详细讲；有的主张不讲。一般的还是根据华北局原来指示的训练内容，扼要地讲了社会主义的远景，指出了革命的前途，而着重的讲了新民主主义的生产方向和生产政策。这样讲的，一般效果是好的。但是河北省委宣传部有些同志，长时期在思想上不同意华北局这个方针，他们主张详细地讲社会主义社会的具体情形，讲集体农场中私有财产的种类和数量，例如几亩菜园几只鸡等。他们的理由是：党员群众要打破砂锅问到底，不详细讲不行。他们讲的结果，农民党员根据自己的习惯和认识，不但一时无法了解，反而引出更多的糊涂思想来。有些领导同志，没有及时地引导学员思想到正确的方面来，反而机械地认为“新的糊涂认识之展开和暴露是必要的，这才能准确的给予解决”。殊不知前途教育是必要的，社会发展的必然规律是必须讲解的，而农村党员的亲身体验与社会主义是有很大距离的，如果硬要讲“具体情形”，其结果正如河北省委宣传部的总结中所说：“各地在解决这一问题时，大都不够深刻。”而影响了对最主要最现实的新民主主义的生产方向和政策的讲解。河北省委宣传部某些同志的想法和做法，不论在思想认识上及具体方法上，都是值得各地引以为教训的。
