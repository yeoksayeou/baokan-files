　　The distribution of Renminbi to rural areas, and the shift away from bartering to expand the domestic currency market, has become a matter of extreme importance to Party and government departments at all levels in Cha Province. Arrangements were made at joint conferences of special district and county heads, and counties were ordered to conscientiously implement and report relevant materials on schedule. In Yanbei, various counties, in conjunction with local Party and government organs, vigorously conducted propaganda and education to make the masses aware of the benefits of using Renminbi. At the county heads' meeting in Chanan, it was proposed that county heads must vigorously promote Renminbi after returning to their respective counties, and first organize currency promotion committees. The Cha Province branch of the People's Bank of China has determined that expanding the currency market is one of the central tasks for April, May, and June, requiring that all market towns in the province use currency by the end of June, and that the Renminbi position be expanded in rural areas with a focus. According to the spirit of the branch's financial conference, the special district offices notified their subordinate branches to make contact with relevant local departments as a daily task. Chanan sent the experience of promoting currency in Chicheng to various places for reference. In addition, the provincial People's Bank has established close contact with the Suiyuan branch to discuss effective steps to promote currency in rural areas and strictly manage gold and silver; and determined Datong and Fengzhen as key contact points. Thanks to stable prices, the active efforts of staff, and the strong support and cooperation of trade and cooperative departments in various places, a large amount of Renminbi was brought to market towns and rural areas through favorable conditions such as staff going to the countryside using currency instead of grain coupons, farmers selling grain in cities, peddlers going to the countryside, and some immigration loans. For example, the currency brought to the countryside by the masses in Huailai accounted for 60% of their earnings from selling goods. In Chaigoubao and Yanggao, the currency brought to the countryside each accounted for 40% of the transaction amount. Currently, currency is circulating in areas around Zhangbei (100 *li*), Shangdu (70-80 *li*), Baoyuan (120 *li*), Kangbao (80 *li*), Huaian (40 *li*), Hunyuan (60 *li*), and Xuan City (40 *li*). According to preliminary statistics, approximately 670 million yuan of Renminbi is circulating in fifty market towns across thirty-two counties in the province. In terms of population, the province has 3.78 million people. As of the end of February, the population using domestic currency was 1.15 million, which increased to 1.63 million by the end of May, accounting for 43% of the total population. The masses have expressed their willingness to accept and save currency. For example, old folks in Duolun save their currency instead of spending it, fearing it won't come back if they use it. It's difficult to buy local products and grain from old folks at supply and marketing cooperatives without using currency. In Chanan, the Shacheng Grain Company in Wei County was rejected by the masses when it tried to exchange their grain for homespun cloth. An old man in Wei County sold two cows and brought all the money home, and a tofu shop sold 600,000 yuan worth of goods, but was reluctant to spend it and saved it for a month. These are all unprecedented events. Merchants are also happy to trade in Renminbi. Since Chicheng vigorously promoted currency in January, the amount of currency in the market has increased more than sevenfold by March.

　　In addition, the value of currency has gradually increased, and it is cheaper to buy goods with currency than with goods. For example, in Yangyuan County, Xuanhua Special District, one *chi* of cloth costs 2,300 yuan in currency, but would cost 2,500 yuan worth of grain. A pack of cigarettes in Xiagarden costs 1,200 yuan in currency, but would cost 1,300 yuan worth of grain. In Wei County, Chanan, one *jin* of white hemp costs 5,000 yuan in currency, but would cost 6,500 yuan worth of grain. In Zhaoshizhuang, Sixth District, Yanggao, one *sheng* of rice used to be exchanged for ten pieces of tofu, but with one *sheng* of rice worth of currency, only seven or eight pieces could be bought. Now, buying with currency is equivalent to buying with rice, and sometimes even surpasses it. From the perspective of bank deposits, long-term deposits have increased. In the past, withdrawals were made at most in three to five days or on the same day, but now people don't withdraw for ten days or half a month, and many people come to the bank to deposit voluntarily. For example, Xuanhua Yuanda Construction Factory deposited 250,000 yuan in early April, but by early May, it reached 20 million yuan. Longyan Iron Mine pays out approximately 200 million yuan every day, but the balance is constantly maintained at 170 to 180 million yuan. A grocery store in Yanggao also deposits its money and doesn't move it. All of this shows that the prestige of Renminbi has begun to be established among the masses. In the future, with long-term price stability and the proactive cooperation of banks, trade, and cooperative departments, currency circulation will surely see greater development. (Dong Zhensheng)

　　察省人民币大量下乡
    已在三十二县五十个集镇通用
    【本报张家口讯】改变以物易物扩大本币市场，已成察省各地党政部门极端重视的一件工作。专区、县长联席会上作了布置，并令各县认真执行按期汇报有关材料。雁北各县结合当地党政机关大力进行宣传教育，使群众认识到使用人民币的好处。察南在县长会上提出：各县县长回去后一定要大力推行人民币，并首先组织货币推行委员会。人民银行察省分行确定把扩大货币市场作为四、五、六月份中心工作之一，要求六月底作到全省各集镇都使用货币，在乡村中有重点的扩大人民币阵地。各专区办事处根据分行金融会议精神，通知所属各行处将与当地有关部门进行联系作为日常工作。察南把赤城推行货币经验发至各地作为参考。此外，该省人民银行更与绥远分行取得密切联系，商讨了今后推行货币下乡，严格管理金银的有效步骤；并确定大同、丰镇为联系重点。由于物价稳定、工作人员积极努力和各地贸易、合作部门大力支持配合，通过工作人员下乡不用粮票而用货币，以及农民进城粜粮，肩挑小贩下乡和一部移民贷款等有利条件，大批人民币被带下集镇和乡村。如怀来群众带往乡下的货币占他卖东西所得的百分之六十。柴沟堡、阳高带往乡村的货币各占交易额百分之四十。目前张北百里、商都七十至八十里、宝源一百二十里、康保八十里、怀安四十里、浑源六十里、宣市四十里周围地区都流通了货币。据初步统计，全省三十二个县、五十个集镇流通人民币约六亿七千万元。以人口论，全省三百七十八万人，截至二月底止，使用本币人口，计一百一十五万，五月底增到一百六十三万，占总人口百分之四十三。群众都表示乐于接受与保存货币，如：多伦老乡有了货币存着不用，恐怕用了回不来；供销社收购老乡的土产、粮食，不拿货币很难买到；察南蔚县沙城粮食公司以土布换群众粮食，曾遭到群众拒绝；蔚县一个老乡卖了两条牛，把钱完全带回家去，一个豆腐房卖了六十万元，舍不得用，存了一个月：这都是从未有过的事情。商人也都乐于用人民币交易了。赤城自一月大力推行货币，到三月市场货币增加七倍以上。
    此外，货币的价值也已日渐提高，用货币买东西，较实物便宜。如：宣化专区阳原县一尺布用货币买二千三百元，粮食换就得合二千五百元；下花园一盒纸烟用钱买一千二百元，粮食买合一千三百元；蔚县白麻用货币买，一斤五千元，用粮食换则合六千五百元；阳高六区赵石庄，过去一升米换十块豆腐，用一升米的货币只买七八块，现在用货币买与用米买相等，有时甚至还超过。从银行存款来看，长期存款已增多。过去顶多三、五天或当天就提取，现在十天半月亦不取，很多人都自动来银行存款。如宣化远大营造厂，四月初存二十五万元，五月初竟达二千万元；龙烟铁矿每天付款约二亿多，但余额经常保持一亿七八千万；阳高一杂货行也将款存着不动。这都说明了人民币在群众中的威信已开始树立起来。今后在物价长期稳定中以及银行主动和贸易、合作部门互相配合共同努力下，货币流通一定更有大的开展。  （董震生）
