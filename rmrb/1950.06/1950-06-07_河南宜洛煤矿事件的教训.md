　　Lessons from the Yiluo Coal Mine Incident in Henan
　　Dù Bō
Editor's Note: The Yiluo Coal Mine gas explosion incident in Henan was discussed at the 35th meeting of the State Council of the Central People's Government on the 2nd of this month. The meeting listened to the report by Liu Jingfan, Deputy Director of the Supervisory Committee of the State Council, on the investigation and handling of the case, and decided to establish a special team to review and handle it. This newspaper has already reported on the Yiluo Coal Mine incident. In order to ensure that the lessons of this incident receive sufficient attention in various localities, we are publishing this article for reference, with the aim of improving mine management.

The gas explosion at the Yiluo Coal Mine in Henan on February 27th, which resulted in the deaths of 146 workers, is a serious lesson for all state-owned and public coal mines. In the first three months of this year, about ten serious incidents occurred in coal mines across the country, with the Yiluo Coal Mine incident resulting in the most casualties. After the incident, the Central People's Government, the Central-South Military and Political Committee, and the Henan Provincial People's Government attached great importance and concern to it, and immediately sent personnel to investigate and handle the aftermath and relief efforts. The Fifth Meeting of the Central-South Military and Political Committee conducted a special review of the incident and approved the Henan Provincial Government's measures for providing generous compensation to the deceased workers. The Central People's Supervisory Committee has reported the incident to the State Council for deliberation and action.

Why do the Yiluo Coal Mine and other coal mines experience such tragic incidents of worker deaths and injuries? This is not accidental; it is the result of the lack of thought among coal mine management personnel of relying on the working class to run the mines well, and the lack of long-term construction thinking. It has been a year and a half since the liberation of the Yiluo Coal Mine, but a genuine democratic movement has never been launched among the workers. The mine's leading personnel mistakenly believed that the workers' composition was complex, adopted an attitude of distrust towards the workers, and neglected the workers' interests. Before this unfortunate incident, the workers had expressed dissatisfaction with the mine's failure to proceed from reality, blindly pursuing production figures, which led to some workers stealing coal pillars, seriously damaging the mine's engineering. However, the mine's leading cadres did not pay enough attention to this. Although the mine's workers' representative meeting and management committee had held dozens of meetings, they only discussed some unimportant and piecemeal issues, rarely discussing production, engineering equipment, and workers' welfare. Furthermore, the leadership failed to earnestly implement the resolutions passed by the meetings, and failed to make appropriate publicity and explanations to the workers. Workers reflected that "the management committee is an official committee." Even more seriously, the mine still retained the bad practice of arbitrarily detaining workers. In the first three months of this year, the mine detained workers as many as 33 times, while the original feudal foremen were selected as "production models," "employee representatives," and members of the mine management committee. Under such serious management of detachment from the masses, warlordism, and bureaucracy, the workers' enthusiasm and creativity could not be brought into play, good suggestions could not be put forward, and the leaders were completely isolated, unable to understand the actual situation of the mine, and unable to implement the leadership's policies and intentions. As a result, the production order of the Yiluo Coal Mine was disrupted, and production discipline was abandoned. The number of people going down the mine was unknown, there was no registration system at the mine entrance, and the underground system was extremely chaotic. Therefore, knowing that the mine had poor ventilation and heavy methane in the spring, workers were allowed to bring matches down the mine to smoke, which ultimately led to the major gas explosion.

These facts show that the basic key to improving the work of the Yiluo Coal Mine is to thoroughly implement the policy of relying on the working masses to develop production. It must be understood that today is a country led by the working class, and the working class should be the masters of the country, as well as the masters of all state-owned and public mines. The management of state-owned and public mines must inspire and rely on the working masses' sense of ownership in order to bring into play their production enthusiasm and creativity. Because they have been engaged in production labor for many years, they have extremely rich production experience; the responsibility of the leaders is to inspire their class consciousness, guide them to strengthen their own organizations, and consciously engage in production and abide by labor discipline. In this way, the working masses' sense of ownership will be inspired, the working masses' labor enthusiasm will be raised, the management of mining enterprises will be improved, and production efficiency will be increased. At the same time, a large number of workers with technology, experience, ability, and prestige will emerge from the working masses. The mine management committee should boldly promote these worker activists to take charge of mine management, so that they can become the new backbone in coal mine production, in order to better complete the important task assigned by the state to restore and develop coal production. The Yiluo Coal Mine incident shows that the mine's leading cadres do not understand their responsibilities and have committed serious principled errors in their work.

In order to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents like the Yiluo Coal Mine incident, all state-owned and public coal mines must establish a genuine responsibility system in management. The Yiluo Coal Mine incident was a responsibility accident, so it was entirely preventable and avoidable. According to materials from all over the country, especially the Northeast, the various accidents, large and small, that occur in industry and mining are mostly responsibility accidents. For example, among the 283 accidents that occurred at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company in the first quarter of this year, 186 were due to technical incompetence and lack of safety education, 79 were due to poor equipment, and only 18 were due to irresistible accidents. This is enough to prove that the key to ensuring the safety of industrial and mining equipment and employees lies in the subjective efforts of the leadership, and most accidents can be prevented or eliminated by subjective efforts. After the incident, the technical and management personnel of the Yiluo Coal Mine emphasized that the excessive accumulation of methane in the mine was due to the lack of generators and ventilation equipment and other objective difficulties and reasons, and the view that the accident was unavoidable is completely wrong and very harmful. Therefore, they turned a blind eye to the serious situation in the mine that could be completely resolved through subjective efforts, left safety lamps unused, and even though the generator was broken, it could still be repaired and used, but it was abandoned in the open air to rust, so that the methane content in the mine exceeded the regulations and work continued as usual. This is an irresponsible attitude towards state property and worker safety. The leading personnel of all state-owned and public mines must criticize and overcome this erroneous attitude, and establish in their minds the clear view that by actively improving technical conditions and establishing safety systems and measures through subjective efforts, the safety of industry and mining can be guaranteed. Therefore, all state-owned and public coal mines should stipulate a series of safety measures. The first urgent thing to do in this regard is that each mine should conduct regular safety inspections, and resolutely correct the existing unsafe phenomena in the mine, and fight against those who destroy production discipline and safety facilities. At the same time, a special system of safety and discipline inspection should be established, strict inspections should be carried out regularly, and the safety reward and punishment system and reporting system should be effectively implemented; mine safety regulations should be formulated, stipulating that all mine personnel must abide by them together. In addition, safety and discipline education should be strengthened for all workers and staff, their concept of labor discipline should be strengthened, and their scientific knowledge should be improved, so that all mine personnel recognize that ensuring mine safety is their due responsibility, and actively put forward opinions and methods for improving safety facilities. Only when everyone assumes the responsibility of defending safety can accidents be reduced or even completely eliminated.

The Yiluo Coal Mine incident tells us that although state-owned and public coal mines have all the necessary conditions for developing production and improving business management, if our mine leaders lack enthusiasm for the people's coal industry and are infected with the bad habits of bureaucracy, such as Wang Xiangqian and Shi Xinlin of the Yiluo Coal Mine, detach themselves from the working masses, and adopt a perfunctory and irresponsible attitude towards mine safety issues, then not only will they fail to achieve the purpose of increasing production and creating national wealth, but they will also cause unnecessary losses to state property and productive forces, and ruin the future of state-owned and public mines. The lessons of the Yiluo Coal Mine incident are painful. For the benefit of the state and the working class, the leading cadres of all state-owned and public mines should learn a lesson from this.

　　河南宜洛煤矿事件的教训
    杜波
    编者按：宜洛煤矿瓦斯爆炸事件，中央人民政府政务院于本月二日第三十五次政务会议上进行了讨论，并听取了政务院监察委员会副主任刘景范关于此案的调查和处理经过的报告，决定成立专门小组，进行审查处理。本报对于宜洛煤矿事件业已报道，为了使各地对于该事件的教训引起足够的注意，我们刊登这篇文章供各地参考，借以改进矿山管理工作。
    河南宜洛煤矿二月二十七日瓦斯爆炸，死亡工人一百四十六名事件，对于一切国营公营煤矿都是一个严重的教训。全国煤矿在今年头三个月中，连续发生了十次左右的严重事件，而以宜洛煤矿事件死伤最大。这次事件发生后，中央人民政府、中南军政委员会及河南省人民政府对此均极重视与关怀，曾立即派员前往调查，并处理善后救济事宜。中南军政委员会第五次会议，对此次事件进行了专门检讨，批准了河南省政府对于被难工人优予抚恤的办法。中央人民监察委员会已将此次事件报告政务院议处。
    宜洛煤矿和其他煤矿为什么会发生工人死伤的惨痛事件呢？这不是偶然的，这是由于煤矿主管人员缺乏依靠工人阶级办好矿山的思想以及缺乏长期建设思想的恶果。宜洛煤矿从解放到现在，已经一年半，可是一直没有在工人中真正开展过民主运动。该矿领导人员错误地认为工人成份复杂，对工人采取了不信任的态度，并忽视工人利益。在这次不幸事件发生前，工人群众曾对该矿不从实际出发，盲目追求生产数字，因而引起部分工人偷挖煤柱，严重破坏矿井工程等现象，表示不满。可是该矿领导干部，对此并未引起足够注意。该矿工人代表会与管理委员会虽也曾开过几十次会议，但所讨论的尽是一些无关重要的零星问题，很少讨论生产、工程设备和工人福利的问题，而领导上对会议通过的决议，未能认真执行，又不向工人群众作适当的宣传解释。工人反映说：“管委会是官会”。更为严重的，是该矿仍然存在随便扣押工人的恶劣制度。今年头三个月，该矿扣押工人竟达三十三次之多，而对于原来的封建把头却选为“生产模范”、“职工代表”和矿山管理委员会委员等。在这种严重的脱离群众的军阀主义和官僚主义的管理之下，工人群众的积极性和创造性无从发挥，有好的建议无从提出，而领导者就完全陷于孤立，既无法了解矿山实际情况，也无法将领导方针和意图贯彻下去。这样，宜洛煤矿的生产秩序破坏了，生产纪律废弛了。下井人数不知多少，井口没有检查登记制度，井下制度也极端混乱。因此，明知矿内通风不良，春天沼气很重，而任令工人私带火柴下井抽烟，终至引起这次瓦斯爆炸的大惨案。
    这些事实说明，改进宜洛煤矿工作的基本关键，是必须彻底执行依靠工人群众发展生产的方针。必须了解，今天是工人阶级领导的国家，工人阶级应该是国家的主人，也是一切国营公营矿山的主人。国营公营矿山的管理，必须启发和依靠工人群众的主人翁的感觉，才能发挥他们的生产积极性与创造性。由于他们多年从事于生产劳动，具有极丰富的生产经验；领导者的责任，是在启发他们的阶级觉悟，指导他们加强自己的组织，自觉的从事生产和遵守劳动纪律。这样，工人群众的主人感觉才会启发，工人群众的劳动热忱才会提高，矿山企业的管理工作才会搞好，生产效率才会提高。同时，工人群众中也就会有大批有技术、有经验、有能力、有威信的工人涌现出来。矿山管理委员会应该大胆提拔这些工人积极分子来担任矿山管理工作，使他们成为煤矿生产中新的骨干，才能很好地完成国家所给予的恢复与发展煤业生产的重大任务。宜洛煤矿事件说明，该矿领导干部对自己的职责是不认识的，在工作上犯了严重的原则性的错误。
    为了防止类似宜洛煤矿事件的发生，各国营公营煤矿在管理方面，必须建立起真正的责任制度。宜洛煤矿事件属于责任事故，因此是完全可以事先防止与避免发生的。根据全国各地特别是东北的材料，工矿业中所发生的各种大小事故，属于责任事故者为最多。如鞍山钢铁公司今年第一季度所发生的二百八十三次事故中，因技术不熟练，缺乏安全教育者一百八十六件，因设备不良者七十九件，不可抗拒的意外事故仅十八件。这就足以证明保障工矿设备和职工安全的关键，在于领导人员主观的努力，绝大部分的事故是可以由主观努力来防止或消灭的。宜洛煤矿技术及管理人员在事件发生之后，强调该矿沼气积存过多，是由于缺乏发电机通风设备等客观困难和客观原因，而认为事故不可避免的观点，是完全错误的和十分有害的。因此，对该矿完全可以经过主观努力而解决的严重情况，熟视无睹，有安全灯而搁置不用，发电机坏了仍可修理使用，竟任其弃置露天生锈，以致矿井内沼气含量超过规定仍照常工作，这是对国家财产与工人安全不负责任的态度。一切国营公营矿山的领导人员，必须批判和克服这种错误态度，在思想上明确树立起经过主观的积极努力，改善技术条件，建立安全制度和办法，就可以保障工矿安全的观点。因此，各国营公营煤矿应该规定一系列的安全措施。在这一方面首先迫切要做的，是各矿山应经常进行安全大检查，切实纠正矿山现存的不合安全要求的现象，与破坏生产纪律、安全设施的分子进行斗争。同时，更应建立安全与纪律检查专责制度，经常进行严格检查，切实实行安全奖惩制度与报告制度；制定矿山安全规章，规定全体矿山人员必须共同遵守。此外，应加强对全体工人、职员的安全与纪律教育，加强其劳动纪律观念，提高其科学知识，使全矿山人员认识保障矿山安全是自己应尽的责任，而积极提出改进安全设施的意见与办法。只有大家负起保卫安全的责任，才可以使事故减少以至完全消灭事故的发生。
    宜洛煤矿事件告诉我们，虽然国营公营煤矿具有一切发展生产，改进经营管理的必要条件，但是我们的矿山领导干部，如果对人民的煤矿事业缺乏热情，沾染了官僚主义的恶劣习气，如宜洛煤矿王象乾、石新林等一样，脱离工人群众，对矿山安全问题采取马虎潦草，不负责任的态度，那就不仅不能达到增加生产，创造国家财富的目的，而且一定会使国家财产和生产力蒙受不必要的损失，断送国营公营矿山的前途。宜洛煤矿事件的教训是惨痛的，为了国家与工人阶级的利益，一切国营公营矿山的领导干部，都应该从这里学得教训。
