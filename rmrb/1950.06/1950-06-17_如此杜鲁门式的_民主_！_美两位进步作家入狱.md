Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: Hollywood progressive writers Lawson and Trumbo began serving their one-year sentences on the 9th for contempt of the House Un-American Activities Committee. According to a TASS dispatch from Washington: Before entering prison, Lawson and Trumbo issued a statement to reporters. They said: "Amidst the false propaganda and shameless talk about 'freedom' and 'democracy,' we are being locked up in jail today. A government that imprisons writers for their opinions has no right to call itself a democracy." They further said: We denounce: Our imprisonment is part of the plan of big business and its political spokesmen in Washington to launch a third world war. People in America and everywhere else demand peace. But Truman and Acheson completely refuse to consider a peaceful resolution and declare that the United States is determined to rely on force and military threats. In the conclusion of their statement, Lawson and Trumbo expressed their belief that the war movement of American imperialists will be stopped.

　　如此杜鲁门式的“民主”！
    美两位进步作家入狱
    【新华社十二日讯】美国好莱坞进步作家劳森和特鲁波于九日起，开始因蔑视众院非美活动委员会而被判处的一年刑期。据塔斯社华盛顿讯：劳森和特鲁波在入狱之前，对记者发表声明。他们说：“在关于‘自由’与‘民主’的虚假宣传与无耻谈论中，我们今日要被关进监牢。为了作家的意见就把他们关起来的政府，无权自称为民主制度。”他们进一步说：我们控诉：囚禁我们，乃是大企业及其在华盛顿的政治发言人发动第三次世界大战的计划的一部分。在美国和其他任何地方，人民都要求和平。但杜鲁门和艾奇逊却完全拒绝考虑和平解决，并申明美国决心依靠武力和军事威胁。劳森和特鲁波在声明的结语中，相信美国帝国主义者的战争运动，将被阻止。
