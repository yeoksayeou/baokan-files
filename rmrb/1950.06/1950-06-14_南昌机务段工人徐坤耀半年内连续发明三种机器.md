　　Nanchang Railway Bureau Worker Xu Kunyao Invents Three Machines in Half a Year
　　Xu Kunyao, an old worker at the Nanchang Railway Bureau of the Shanghai Railway Administration, recently created a water pump cylinder boring machine. The water supply station had a Watt water pump, and because it had been in use for too long, the water cylinder of the pump had become oval. When used, it not only wasted steam, but also the water it sucked up did not have much lifting power. Last month, the water pump needed major repairs, and the Railway Bureau assigned the work to Xu Kunyao. After several days of careful research, he invented a cylinder boring machine. After the Railway Bureau approved it, manufacturing began according to his plan. The forging and turning groups completed all the parts in a week. Xu Kunyao then personally installed it. On May 23rd, the section tested the water pump cylinder boring machine, and the results were excellent. The lathe tool only needed half an hour to go from one end to the other; in this way, the inner diameter of an oval water cylinder could be made perfectly round in just three hours.
　　In January of this year, Comrade Xu Kunyao used waste materials to create an oil press. In April, he created a blower, saving four workers and 960 work hours per month. Due to his inventions and creations, the section solved the difficulties of insufficient tools and manpower shortage.

　　南昌机务段工人徐坤耀半年内连续发明三种机器
    上海铁路局南昌机务段老工人徐坤耀最近创造了一种水泵搪缸机。该段给水所有一部华氏水泵，因使用太久，水泵的水缸变成了椭圆形，使用时不但浪费蒸汽，而且吸上来的水没有多大顶力。上月，该段水泵应大加修理，铁局把这工作交给徐坤耀负责。他经过几天的仔细研究，发明了一种搪缸机，经铁路局批准后，按照他的计划开始制造，锻工组和车工组在一周中完成了全部机件。徐坤耀就亲自动手装置。五月二十三日，该段试用了水泵搪缸机，成绩很好。车刀从这头到那头，只需半时；这样一只椭圆水缸的内径，只要三小时便可成为正圆了。
    今年一月间，徐坤耀同志曾利用废料创造了一具压油机。四月间，他又创造了送风机，节省了四个人力，一个月可节省九百六十个工时。由于他的发明创造，使该段解决了工具不足和人力缺乏的困难。
