　　The Trade Union of North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant Actively Leads Production
    The Trade Union of North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant led workers in discussing production plans, organizing production competitions, and launching a movement to conserve and combat waste, thereby improving workers' labor productivity and reducing costs. For example, the factory originally planned to use fifteen workdays to produce one waterwheel in April, but in reality, it took an average of eleven workdays. In May, it was further reduced to 8.48 workdays. According to preliminary estimates, the savings in work hours alone in May amounted to 39,000 catties of millet.

    The Trade Union's Central Task is to Ensure Good Production
    Previously, the trade union cadres of the factory did not have a clear understanding of the working principle of "trade unions facing production" and were busy running cooperatives, issuing rooms, opening loan slips, and issuing leave slips all day long. The cadres were very busy, but the masses felt that the trade union did not solve problems. They said, "The trade union only knows how to collect membership fees." The cadres were also unwilling to be trade union cadres. In early February of this year, the preparatory committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions convened the first workers' representative conference, which clearly put forward the principle that "the central task of trade union work is to do a good job in production." The factory's trade union cadres began to establish the view of "production first." In March, the factory held a full factory workers' representative meeting to convey the spirit of the first Beijing Workers' Congress. Subsequently, a factory management committee was established, and trade union branch committees were established in the workshops. In early May, the trade union committee members made specific divisions of labor, gradually getting rid of the previous administrative work and going deep into the front line to lead production. The trade union also took the initiative to organize workers to discuss the production plan for May. At that time, some workers still had some ideological concerns about production bonuses and wages. After repeated explanations and individual mobilization by the trade union, the workers' enthusiasm gradually increased. The production teams unanimously proposed to ensure the completion of the production tasks proposed by the administration, and some even raised the production plan. For example, the chain group of the forging workshop originally planned to produce 1,500 catties of materials per day with three people, but the workers automatically revised it to 1,700 catties of materials per day with two people. In this way, not only was the production plan in line with reality, but it also eliminated the previous problem of keeping the plan with the team leader, where the workers did not know their own tasks and passively waited for the team leader to assign work. The workers had a clear understanding of their tasks, which increased their initiative in production. Now, the chain group of the forging workshop produces 1,900 catties of materials per day with two people.

    Select Key Teams for Specific Assistance
    In order to make a breakthrough at one point and promote the overall situation, preparing to launch a production competition, the trade union selected the relatively advanced lathe operator Zhang Fengquan team and the foundry worker Lu Fu team as key teams to provide specific assistance. The first step was to conduct ideological education. The trade union helped the lathe operator Zhang Fengquan team to learn from the experience of the Northeast Ma Hengchang team, voluntarily established a labor pact and machine safety system in the entire team, and also established production review meetings, technical research meetings, etc., to study production problems at any time and improve the quality and quantity of the team's products. On May 26, the team completed the task of producing 350 waterwheel vertical shafts and pins for the June production ahead of schedule, and there was not a single defective product. Under the leadership of this team, the entire lathe workshop launched a competition between teams, and generally exceeded the plan.

    Launch a Production Competition After All Preparations Are Completed
    The key teams were doing well, appropriate production plans were established, and the workers' enthusiasm was generally improved after the April award work. Based on this, the factory management committee decided to launch a production competition. On May 15, a celebration meeting was held, and after the awards were given, the director of the trade union called on everyone to launch a production competition. At the meeting, the factory director guaranteed to complete the construction of workers' dormitories, bathhouses, children's schools, sports fields, etc. within a certain period of time. The workers were in high spirits. The workers in the fitter workshop proposed on the spot to ensure the assembly of 700 waterwheels in May, assembling them as soon as they arrived. The workshop director, the director of the trade union branch, and the production department of the factory trade union, based on the production capacity at that time, proposed a challenge: as long as the foundry workshop can supply semi-finished products in time, they will guarantee to complete the production task of 350 waterwheels in June ahead of schedule in May, plus the production task in May, a total of 1,050 waterwheels will be produced. Faced with this heroic challenge, the forging workshop and the foundry workshop initially had no confidence, feeling that their manual production might not meet the requirements of the lathe workshop. The foundry workshop carefully calculated its strength and could not only supply semi-finished products, but also complete it one day ahead of schedule. The Chen Yongxiang team in the forging workshop also proposed the task of producing 600 screws per day (the highest record in the past was 400 per team). As a result, not only did this team reach 900 screws per day, but another team also reached 770. In this case, each workshop launched a vigorous production competition. In late May, the trade union also helped each workshop to improve the production daily report system, and promptly announced the production situation and new records of each team, stimulating the lower-output teams to catch up quickly.

    Go Deep into the Workshop for Inspection and Carry Out the Conservation Movement
    The production competition was launched enthusiastically, but there was serious waste in the factory. The lathe workshop often ran empty cars when eating at night shifts, which wasted electricity and damaged the machines, and was prone to danger. Some of the new machines from Shanghai needed to be repaired after only two or three months of use. Valuable high-speed steel and drill bits were sometimes found in the scrap iron pile. On May 19, the management committee issued a call to launch a conservation movement on the basis of the production competition. The trade union immediately convened a general meeting of all employees to make publicity and explanation. And went deep into the workshop to carry out mass specific inspection. Each workshop formulated a specific conservation plan in response to the waste phenomenon.

    The main reason why the trade union of the factory can make these achievements is that the party branch of the factory can guarantee production, and the administration really relies on the masses to run the factory well. The party branch meeting of the factory often discusses production issues; when the administration encounters difficulties, it asks the workers to find solutions. Because the grassroots trade union organizations are not sound enough, and the trade union committee has not formed the leading core of the entire movement, the work cannot keep up with the development speed of the mass movement in a timely manner; and in the competition, not enough emphasis is placed on improving quality, resulting in an increase in the scrap rate of the foundry workshop. Although there are still many shortcomings in the work of the trade union, the workers' impression of the trade union has begun to change. In the past, the trade union developed members, and the organization committee would go to the workers, but now the workers come to the trade union.

### 华北农业机械总厂工会积极领导生产

　　华北农业机械总厂工会积极领导生产
    华北农业机械总厂工会，领导工人讨论生产计划，组织生产竞赛，开展节约反浪费运动，提高了工人的劳动生产率，减低了成本。例如：该厂四月份原计划用十五个工造一部水车，实际上平均用十一个工就造成了。五月份更降低到八点四八个工。据初步估计，五月份仅就节省工时一项计算，折合小米达三万九千斤。
    工会中心工作保证搞好生产
    该厂工会干部，以前对“工会面向生产”的工作方针，认识不够明确，整天忙着办合作社，办理发室，开借款单，开请假单等事务。干部们很忙，群众反觉得工会不解决问题，他们说：“工会只知道要会费。”干部也不愿当工会干部。今年二月初，北京市总工会筹委会召开首届工人代表大会，明确提出了“工会工作的中心任务是搞好生产”的方针。该厂工会干部开始建立了“生产第一”的观点。三月间，该厂召开全厂职工代表会议，传达北京首届工代大会的精神。接着，成立了工厂管理委员会，并建立了工会车间支会。五月初，工会委员作了具体分工，逐步摆脱以前的事务工作，深入现场，领导生产。工会并主动地组织工人，讨论五月份的生产计划。当时，部分工人对生产奖金、工资等还有些思想顾虑，经过工会的反复解释和个别动员，工人情绪逐渐高涨。各生产小组一致提出保证完成行政上所提出的生产任务，有的并将生产计划提高。如锻工场链条组原订计划是三人一天下料一千五百斤，工人自动改订为两人一天下料一千七百斤。这样，不只生产计划切合了实际，而且免除了以前把计划停留在小组长身上，工人不明确自己的任务，只被动地等组长派活的毛病。工人对自己的任务有了数，增加了生产时的主动性。现在，锻工场链条组两人下料，每天已达一千九百斤。
    选定重点小组进行具体帮助
    为了突破一点，推动全局，准备开展生产竞赛，工会选择了进步较快的车工张凤泉小组、铸工吕富小组作重点组，进行具体帮助。首先是进行了思想教育。工会帮助车工张凤泉小组学习了东北马恒昌小组的经验，在全组自愿订立了劳动公约与机器保安制度，还建立了生产检讨会，技术研究会等，随时研究生产中的问题，提高全组产品的质量和数量。五月二十六日，该组即提前完成了六月份生产三百五十部水车的立横轴和梢子的任务，而且没有一个废活。全车工场在该组带动下，展开了组与组的竞赛，普遍地超过了计划。
    一切准备就绪发起生产竞赛
    重点小组搞好了，适当的生产计划订立了，工人们经过四月份评奖工作，情绪普遍提高了。在这个基础上，该厂管委会决定开展生产竞赛。五月十五日举行庆功大会，发奖之后，工会主任号召大家展开生产竞赛。会上，厂长保证在一定时间内完成工人宿舍、澡堂、子弟学校、运动场等等建筑。工人情绪很高。钳工场的工人当场提出五月份保证装配七百部水车，随到随装。车工场的场主管、工会支会主任和厂工会生产部，根据当时的生产能力，提出挑战；只要铸工场能及时供给半成品，他们就保证把六月份生产任务中的三百五十部水车，在五月份提前完成，加上五月份的生产任务，共出产一千零五十部水车。面对这个英勇的挑战，锻工场、铸工场起初没有信心，觉得自己是手工生产，恐怕供不上车工场的要求。铸工场仔细计算了自己的力量，不但可供上半成品，而且能提前一天完成。锻工场陈永祥小组，也提出每天出产六百个螺丝的任务（过去最高纪录是每组出四百个）。结果，不只他这一组达到每天出产九百个，另一组也达到了七百七十个。就在这种情况下，各车间展开了轰轰烈烈的生产竞赛。五月下旬，工会又帮助各车间把生产日报制健全起来，及时公布各小组的生产情况和新纪录，刺激产量较低的小组，很快赶了上来。
    深入车间检查  开展节约运动
    生产竞赛是热烈地展开了，但是，厂子里存在着严重的浪费现象。车工场夜班吃饭时，常开空车，既费电又损机器，容易出危险。从上海来的新机器，有的只用了两三个月就要修理。在烂铁堆里有时检出贵重的锋钢、钻头。五月十九日，管委会提出了在生产竞赛的基础上展开节约运动的号召。工会立即召开了全体职工大会，作了宣传解释。并深入到车间，展开群众性的具体检查。各车间都针对浪费现象，订出具体节约的计划。
    该厂工会工作所以能做出这些成绩，主要原因是该厂党的支部能保证生产，行政方面真正作到依靠群众办好工厂。该厂党支部会上，经常讨论生产问题；行政方面遇到困难，就交给工人想办法。由于工会基层组织还不够健全，工会委员会没有形成整个运动的领导核心，所以在工作上还不能及时跟上群众运动的发展速度；而且在竞赛中，对提高质量强调得还不够，以致铸工场的报废率提高。虽然工会工作还存许多缺点，但是该厂工人对工会的印象开始转变了。以前工会发展会员，都是组织委员去找工人，现在则是工人来找工会了。
