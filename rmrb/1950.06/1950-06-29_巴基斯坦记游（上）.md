A Trip to Pakistan (Part 1)
By Geladekefu
Translated by Gong Qiren

Pakistan was originally a part of India. In August 1947, the British ruling group's "divide and rule" plan for India (the Mountbatten Plan) was realized, and India was divided into two "dominions," one of which was Pakistan.

Geladekefu's "A Trip to Pakistan," originally published in the "New Times" magazine in issues 20 and 21, is a travel impression.

I. From the Khyber Pass to Karachi

Our dilapidated Chevrolet mail truck, rattling and groaning, arrived at the Khyber Pass. We were finally coming to the end of our tiring journey from Kabul. Because there is no air route between Afghanistan and Pakistan, we had to take this kind of car in Kabul. High mountain roads (some 4,000 meters above sea level), dizzying cliffs, steep up and down slopes, terrifying narrow paths—all these were now behind us.

We passed through the routine border checks and entered Pakistan. Although the scenery and climate remained unchanged, one immediately felt that this was another country. The car followed a good cement road up the slope. Next to the road was a country lane, and a railway ran almost parallel to it, extending to the mountainside, through tunnels.

Along the way, one could often see, in the small valleys between the peaks, set against a dark brown background, some vaguely discernible gray huts. These were the dwellings of the border residents, surrounded by narrow strips of farmland. Caravans of donkeys and camels carrying baskets and sacks moved slowly along the dirt road. We occasionally encountered rows of women with large water bottles on their heads, who quickly pulled down their veils as we approached. Men, bent over carrying large bundles of firewood, made way for us to pass.

The primitive conditions of these people contrasted sharply with the cement highway and the railway with its tunnels and steel bridges. One would wonder how these impoverished people, these people who worked their small plots of land by hand, could have dug these tunnels, built these bridges, laid such a long railway, and completed all sorts of other complex construction projects.

The answer could be found in the cross-sections of the rails, the switches, and the signal machines, and in the engines and cars. They all bore the mark "Made in England." From the smallest screw to the locomotive, everything came from England. The British authorities were not afraid of trouble in building modern railways and roads here. There was no traffic on the railways, and obstacles to stop tanks were piled up along the roads; therefore, the architects' motives were clearly not so well-intentioned for the convenience of travel for the people of these remote areas, enabling them to communicate with the big cities. The construction of the road was entirely for another purpose, which was to protect British colonial interests.

As soon as we passed through the Khyber Pass, the outline of a distant city appeared through the mist; a few minutes later, our car arrived on the streets of Peshawar.

At the hotel, brown-skinned Muslim servants waited on us. White people sat and ate, and brown-skinned people served the food. There were not many travelers, most of them were British—who came to this provincial capital on business, and the aircrew of the Karachi-Peshawar line. There were also a few American "tourists."

We had a few hours to spare before our plane to Karachi took off. We decided to take a walk around the city and browse through the local market. We witnessed in real life the scenes that we had only known from books and movies in the past, except that the markets shown in the movies were much cleaner, and of course, did not have so many smells.

Imagine a small street only about three meters wide, with all kinds of goods piled up haphazardly along the street. Piles of various fruits were next to various colors of clothing. Among the mutton hanging on iron hooks, piles of naan bread, polo rice and other oriental foods, were socks, clothes and veils. A barber squatted in the middle of the road, shaving his customers. Tame donkeys squeezed next to fruit stalls. There were many dirty, ragged beggars; they were skin and bones, and their hungry eyes were always fixed on the piles of rice, polo rice, and naan bread. They wandered around the market, begging from the shopkeepers.

We wandered through several blocks of the market in the crowd, and because we were far from the hotel, we decided to take a carriage back. We later discovered that it was a mistake not to negotiate the fare in advance, because the driver took the opportunity to overcharge us. And we were so surprised when we saw him give all the money to a well-dressed fat man waiting not far away. We realized that the fat man was the owner of the horse and carriage. All the carriage drivers in Peshawar were employed in this way. The employer paid a pittance of wages and drove the carriage drivers to work almost twenty-four hours a day, and when the day's income was too low, he would whip the carriage driver.

II. The Capital of Pakistan

The time came and we boarded the plane—it was to take us from one end of Pakistan to the other. The plane sped over the green streets of Peshawar and flew towards Rawalpindi. Some of us who were new to India were looking forward to seeing lush jungles below. But although we looked carefully, we saw nothing but a dry, barren desert. Occasionally there was a river, with ditches diverting water to irrigate small plots of land. Apart from a few large orchards between Peshawar and Rawalpindi, trees were only occasionally seen.

But we finally arrived in Karachi, the capital of Pakistan. Karachi is located in the province of Sindh and is the political and commercial center of Pakistan. Governor-General Nazimuddin's residence is here; it occupies a large plot of land, surrounded by stone walls, with a sentry post set up every fifty meters or so around the stone walls. The residences of Prime Minister Ali Khan and other ministers of the Central Government of Pakistan are also nearby. Not far away is the National Bank—only in name, as it belongs to private capital. Nearby stands the Constituent Assembly Building, where the Prime Minister and other cabinet members work, with some departments located in a building across the street. Not far away on McLeod Road is the Cotton Exchange, the center of the most prosperous commercial activity in West Pakistan.

The population of Karachi has not yet been accurately counted, but it is estimated that, with the influx of refugees, the population is now between one million and one and a half million. This capital of Pakistan is a small oriental city with no suburbs. Karachi has no large department stores. Almost all the goods are foreign products from Britain and the United States.

At all the intersections in the city center, large English signs advertise the advantages of British and American goods, from Dunlop tires to Philips toothpaste.

Karachi's city traffic is very primitive. In addition to carriages, the main means of transportation is rickshaws, with seats for two passengers placed between the two rear wheels. This is hard work, especially when encountering fat passengers and uphill roads, or when encountering headwinds. It is distressing to see the panting and sweating driver desperately pedaling along, and the passenger will slap him on the back a few times or poke him with a stick to make him run faster. We didn't see any rickshaw drivers over thirty years old; this inhumane labor kills them early. As for other means of transportation, Karachi has very few buses, and the streetcars are mostly on the busiest street. Although there are taxis outside the hotels, stations, and airports, most of them have foreigners sitting inside.

Karachi is a city of merchants, shopkeepers, officials, and employees; it is also a city of beggars, homeless people, and unemployed people who wander the streets all day, seeking occasional rewards and alms.

Standing among the green trees is a beautiful two-story building, which belongs to the director of Habib Bank, Pakistan's largest bank, a well-known capitalist. Of course, this private residence has all the conveniences: electrical equipment, modern water and gas installations, electric fans, etc. But just across the street, the poor people's wooden houses are swaying in the wind—because they are not exactly wooden houses. These dwellings are just a few wooden stakes stuck in the ground, with old sacks spread over them as roofs and walls. There are rows and rows of such houses, inhabited by families of poor people and unemployed people, who have nothing but some dirty rags to use as bedding, a pot, and a pan.

At night, people squeeze together to sleep on the side of the road. These are the homeless. Their families, including children and the elderly, sleep on the asphalt, covered with sacks and rags.

Walking down the street, you will encounter men with generous gestures and gorgeous clothes, wearing well-tailored European-style clothing. These are the merchants, bankers, and senior officials of Karachi. They are accompanied by their wives and daughters, dressed in stylish clothes and covered in jewels. But on this same street, you will also see hundreds of men, women, and children, wearing only something smaller than a loincloth.

Also, what is shocking is that you will encounter naked people on this busy street. The locals are apparently used to it and pay no attention. But we were naturally shocked and asked some questions about it. An official who was guiding us replied that these people belonged to a special tribe, which allowed its members to be naked in public. This sounded somewhat reasonable on the surface, but a local carriage driver later told us that those people were just too poor to afford a piece of cloth to cover their bodies. In fact, these people were frighteningly thin.

Speaking of the crowds on the streets, Karachi, like other places in Pakistan, can be called a city of men. Almost no women are seen. In other Muslim countries, women stay at home all day to take care of housework and wait for their men. They also go out, but rarely, and often with their faces covered. But this only applies to women of the middle class—the wives of small businessmen, shop owners, small officials, etc. A local newspaper explained to us that the women of wealthy families were not prohibited by their religion from showing their faces. And the women of poor families did not even have the money to buy the most necessary clothes, let alone veils.

There are hundreds of British people in Karachi, mostly government officials, senior officers in the Pakistani army, owners or shareholders of large trading companies, doctors, and missionaries. Many have exquisite villas, with countless native servants carefully tending the lawns and gardens.

There is no sign of any cultural life in this capital of Pakistan. There are no theaters, no music schools, and not even a concert hall. There are about ten or twelve cinemas. Some only show British and American films, and American and British film companies are able to flood the rest of the cinemas with their products without encountering any obstruction from the local authorities. The only reason they don't do this is that the vast majority of people do not understand English. All government orders and announcements in Pakistan are in English, but this does not change the fact that only a small number of merchants and officials can read English. Workers and farmers do not understand English at all, and most cannot even read or write their own language.

Karachi has several colleges and commercial schools, but only wealthy parents can afford the tuition fees. The teaching is in English, and most of the teachers are trained in British and American schools. Some courses are actually taught by people from British and American churches. All this determines what kind of ideas are taught to the students. When we visited a college, the students asked some of the most absurd questions, showing how ignorant they were of everything related to the Soviet Union.

"Tell us," they asked, "do you have money in the Soviet Union, or are wages paid in kind? Can people raise their own children, or are infants taken away as soon as they are born? Does the Soviet Union produce any machines? Was this suit you are wearing really made in the Soviet Union? How many unemployed people do you have?" etc.

In later conversations, we discovered that the professors and lecturers had embellished their courses with some of the most terrible rumors about the Soviet Union. Of course, we knew that the bourgeoisie often spread various slanders and rumors about our country. But, frankly, we never imagined that these rumors would be so brazen and shameless.

III. Travel in the Provinces

We visited another town—Hyderabad in Sindh Province, 127 miles from Karachi. This small town has about twelve cotton ginning mills and is the center of the province's cotton industry. The poverty we saw here was even worse than what we had seen in Karachi, so much so that it could not be described in words.

We visited several cotton ginning mills. The equipment was primitive, the working conditions were very bad, rows of cotton ginning machines were placed in a small shed, and they were driven by a steam engine. There was no ventilation, the air was filled with dust and dirt, and the workers' noses, eyes, ears, and mouths were all covered with dust. Lung disease is very prevalent in these places, and when workers get sick and cannot work, they are expelled and left to fend for themselves.

As far as we know, the workers earn only one or one and a half rupees a day, just enough to keep them from starving to death. This is the life of Pakistani workers. A few days later, we went to a small village ten miles from Karachi. Some simple thatched huts were clustered on the bare and dry ground. There was no vegetation around them—no gardens, no vegetable plots, and nothing else. The area of the entire village was not even one hectare. The farmers lived in sheds made of palm leaves or burlap. The village had a total of only three donkeys. The village well was just a four-meter-deep pit dug in the center of the village. Dust, garbage, and donkey dung easily flowed into it, and the well water was brownish-yellow.

In Pakistan, about 80 percent of the land is occupied by large landowners, who rent out the land. There are mainly three types of rental systems: under the first system, the tenant must give all the crops harvested to the landlord. In fact, the tenant is just a hired laborer with a very low wage. Under the second system, the tenant must hand over three-quarters of the harvest to the landlord. Under the third system, the tenant must also give 75 to 80 percent of the harvest to the landlord as rent, but this right to rent the land is hereditary, and the landlord may not evict the tenant's family within several years.

　　巴基斯坦记游（上）
    格拉德可夫作
    龚齐仁节译
    巴基斯坦原是印度的一部分。一九四七年八月间，英国统治集团对印度的“分而治之”的计划（蒙巴顿计划）实现了，印度被分为两个“自治领”，巴基斯坦即为其中之一。
    格拉德可夫这篇《巴基斯坦记游》，原载《新时代》杂志二十、二十一两期，是一篇旅行印象记。
              ——编者
  一、从开伯尔山口到喀剌蚩
    我们那破旧的雪佛兰邮车震响呻吟着，到达了开伯尔山口。我们终将结束从喀布尔起程的疲乏的旅行了。因为阿富汗与巴基斯坦间没有航空线，在喀布尔，我们就必得乘这种车。高高的山路（它们有的拔海四千公尺），眩人的险崖，峻峭的上下坡，可怖的羊肠小道——这一些，现在都在我们的后面了。
    我们通过边界例行的检查，进入巴基斯坦国境。虽然景物气候依然未改，人们立刻会感到这是另一个国家。汽车循着一条良好的水泥公路驶上斜坡。靠着公路的是一条乡间道路，而一条铁路几乎是平行着，延伸到山边，通过穿山的隧道。
    沿途人们时常可以看到在山峰间的小谷里，衬着暗褐色的背景的，是一些隐约可辨的灰色小屋。它们是边境居民的住宅，围着它们的是一条条狭窄的耕地。载着箱篮和袋子的驴子和骆驼队，循着那条泥土道路缓缓前进。我们偶尔会遇到头上顶着大水瓶的妇女的行列，在我们走近时，她们赶紧把面罩拉了下来。背负着大捆柴薪匍匐而行的男子，让开路来给我们通过。
    这些人的原始的景况，同水泥公路和有着隧道与钢桥的铁路对照，显然不相调和。人们会奇怪着这些赤贫的人，这些用手在他们的小块土地上操作的人，怎么能够开出这些隧道，架起这些桥梁，铺下这么长的铁路，和完成其他种种复杂的建设工程呢。
    答案可以在轨条的断面、转辙器与信号机上看到，可以在引擎与车子上寻出来。它们都有着“英国制”字样。从顶小的螺丝钉到火车头，每一件东西都是从英国来的。英国当局不怕麻烦，在这里建造新式的铁道和公路。铁路上没有车辆来往，而公路沿线有阻止坦克的障碍物堆积着；因此，建筑家们的动机显然不是那么好意地为了这些边远地区的人民的旅行便利，使他们得以与大城镇相交通往还的。修公路完全是为另一目的，那是用来保卫英国的殖民利益的。
    我们一通过开伯尔山口，远处城市的轮廓就通过薄雾现于眼前；几分钟之后，我们的车子就来到白沙瓦街头了。
    在旅馆里，褐色皮肤的回教徒侍候着我们。白色人坐着吃饭，褐色皮肤的人侍候上菜。旅客的数目是不多的，他们大多数是英国人——因事而来到这个省城的，以及喀剌蚩白沙瓦线的航空人员。那里也有着几个美国的“游历家”。
    在往喀剌蚩的飞机起飞之前，我们有着几小时的余暇。我们决定在城里散散步，并逛一下本地市场。我们在真实的生活中目睹了那过去只从书本和电影中得知的景象，而不同之处，是他们在电影上放映的市场清洁多了，自然，亦没有这么些气味。
    试想一条仅约三公尺宽的小街，沿街五花八门的货物杂乱地堆积着。成堆的各种水果，隔边是各色的衣服。挂在铁钩子上的羊肉、薄饼的尖堆、波罗饭和其他东方食品中间，有着鞋袜、衣服和面纱。理发匠蹲在路中间，替他的顾客修脸。驯良的驴子挤在果子摊旁边。那里有着好些肮脏褴褛的乞丐；他们骨瘦如柴，饥饿的眼光老是钉着那饭堆、波罗饭和薄饼。他们在市场里到处乱走，向店主们讨乞。
    我们在人丛中绕了几段市街，因为离开旅社远了，就决定坐马车回去。我们以后发觉没有把车费预先讲好出了岔子，因为车夫乘机敲了一次大竹杠。而当我们看到他将钱全部交给一个在不远处等着的穿得好好的胖子时，我们是感到多么惊异哟，我们弄清楚了胖子是马和车的主人。整个白沙瓦的马车夫都是这样受雇工作的。雇主付出一点点工资，驱使车夫一天作上差不多二十四小时的工作，而当一天收入太少时，就鞭打着车夫。
  二、巴基斯坦的首都
    到时候我们上了飞机——它要载我们从巴基斯坦的一端到另一端去。飞机急速地掠过白沙瓦绿色的街道，朝着洛阿尔品第飞去。我们中间初来印度的人，有点儿盼望着看到下面繁茂的丛林。但是我们虽然仔细察看，除了一片干燥荒凉的沙漠外并见不到什么。间或有一条河流，有沟渠引水灌溉小块的田地。除了白沙瓦与洛阿尔品第间一些大果园外，树木只可偶尔见到。
    但是我们终于来到巴基斯坦的首都喀剌蚩了。喀剌蚩位于信德省，是巴基斯坦政治与商业中心。纳齐穆丁总督的宅第在这里；它占着广大地基，有石墙围绕着，石墙四周，距五十公尺左右就设置一个岗哨。巴基斯坦中央政府阿里汗总理及其他部长们的住宅亦在附近。不远处，就是国家银行——只是名字上这么叫，它是属于私人资本的。它的附近耸立着制宪会议大厦，总理及其他阁员们在那儿办公，有些部设在对面的一所大厦内。在不远的麦克留路，有着棉业交易所，是西巴基斯坦最繁盛的商业活动中心地。
    喀剌蚩的人口还没有准确的数字，但据估计，加上源源而来的难民，现在人口在一百万至一百五十万之间。这个巴基斯坦的首都是一个东方型的小城市，周围没有市郊。喀剌蚩没有什么大的百货公司。所有的货物几乎都是来自英美的外国货。
    在城中心的所有十字路口，英文的大招牌广告着从邓洛普车胎到菲立普牙膏等英美货物的优点。
    喀剌蚩的市内交通是很原始的。除了马车之外，主要的交通工具就是三轮车，两个后轮中间放上乘坐两个搭客的座位。这是很苦的工作，特别是碰到大胖子搭客和上坡路，或者是碰到逆风。看到那喘着气流着汗的车夫拚命地蹬过去是使人难受的，那搭客还会揍他背上几下或者用棍子戳他要他快跑。我们没看到三十几以上的车夫；这种不人道的劳作使他们早死。至于别的交通工具，喀剌蚩只有很少的公共汽车，电车路大都在那条最热闹的大街上，在旅馆、车站和飞机场外面虽然有出租汽车，那多数是外国人坐在里面的。
    喀剌蚩是一个商人、店主、官吏和雇员的城市；它亦是一个那些整日在街头上流浪，寻求偶然的报酬和施舍的乞丐、无家可归者和失业者的城市。
    在绿树丛中站着一座漂亮的二层大厦，那是属于巴基斯坦最大的哈比银行的董事，一个大家都知道的资本家的。当然这座私邸中有着一切的便利喽：电气设备、新式自来水和煤气装置，电风扇等。但是仅隔一个街口那边，穷人的木屋子却在风里飘摇——因为，那还不是十足的木屋子，这些住屋不过是插在地里的几根木桩，上面张着旧麻袋当屋顶和墙壁。有着像这样的整排整排的房子，住着穷人和失业者的家庭，他们除了一些当铺盖用的脏破布、一把壶和一只锅外，什么都没有。
    晚上，人们挤着睡在路边上。这些就是无家可归的人。他们的家庭，包括小孩老人，就睡在土沥青上面，盖着麻袋和破布。
    在大街上走，你会遇到举止阔绰衣着华丽的男人，穿着剪裁入时的欧式服装。这些是喀剌蚩的商人、银行家、高级官吏。他们带着服式都丽、珠光宝气的老婆和女儿。但是在这同一大街上，你亦将看到成百成百的男女和小孩，只穿着比腰布还小的东西。
    还有，使人惊骇的是，你在这条热闹繁忙的大街上还会碰到一丝不挂的人。当地的人显然是习惯了，不去注意。可是我们自然是大吃一惊，并且问了些关于这事的问题。一个给我们引路的官员回答说这些人属于特殊的一族，他们允许族人在大庭广众中裸体。这听起来表面上有些道理，但是一个当地的车夫后来告诉我们说，那些人只是太穷了，买不起一块破布来蔽体。实在地，这些人是瘦得可怕的。
    说到街上的人群，喀剌蚩和巴基斯坦别的地方一样，可以叫它是一个男人的城市。几乎看不到什么女人。在其他的回教国度里，女人整天在家料理家务，等待他们的男人。她们亦出门去，可是很少，而且常常蒙上面纱。但是这只是适用于中等阶层的妇女——小商人、店老板、小官吏等的老婆。一家当地的报纸给我们解释，富有家庭的妇女并不受她们的宗教禁止去显露她们的脸孔。而穷人家的妇女连买最必要的衣服的钱都没有，说什么面纱呢。
    在喀剌蚩有几百个英国人，多数是政府官员、巴基斯坦军队里的高级军官、大商行的主人或股东、医生和传教师等。许多人有精致的别墅，有无数的土人仆役小心地给照顾草地和花园。
    这巴基斯坦的首都看不出有什么文化生活。没有剧院，没有音乐学校，甚至没有开音乐会的会堂。差不多有十个还是十二个电影院。有些只映英美电影，而美国和英国的影片公司还能够把它们的产品充斥其余的电影院而不会碰到地方当局的什么阻挡。它们之所以不这样做的唯一原因是绝大多数的人不懂英语，巴基斯坦的一切政府命令和公告都用英文，但这亦改变不了只有少数商人和官吏能读英文这一事实。工人和农民一点亦不懂英文，大多数连他们自己的文字亦不会读或写。
    喀剌蚩有几个学院和商业学校，但只有富裕的家长供得起学费。授课是用英文的，多数教员是英美学校训练出来的。有些课程实际上是由英美教会里的人担任。这一切决定了教导学生的是什么一种思想。当我们访问一个学院时，学生们问了一些最荒谬的问题，显出了对于苏联有关的每一事情他们是多么无知。
    “告诉我们”他们问，“你在苏联有没有钱的，工资是以实物付给的吗？人们能不能带养自己的孩子，还是当婴儿一生下来就被夺走了呢？苏联生产了什么机器吗？你穿的这套衣服真的在苏联做的？你们有多少失业者？”等等。
    在以后的谈话当中，我们发现了那些教授和讲师们在他们的课程中添油加醋地加上了关于苏联的一些最可怕的谣言。当然，我们知道，资产阶级常常散布关于我们的国家的各种诽谤与谣言。但，坦白地说，我们从没想到这些谣言竟是如此的厚颜与无耻。
  三、各省的旅行
    我们参观了另一个市镇——离喀剌蚩有一百二十七英里的信德省的海德拉巴城。这小城里约有十二个左右的轧棉机场，它是该省棉制业的中心。我们在这里所见到的贫困的情景比我们曾在喀剌蚩所见到的还要厉害，简直是不能以文字来描述的。
    我们参观了几个轧棉机场。装备都是原始的，工作条件很坏，一排排的轧棉机安置在一个小棚里面，而由一架蒸汽发动机来推动它们，棉花是用手丢入滚筒的。这里没有通风设备，空气充满灰尘而污浊，工人们的鼻子、眼睛、耳朵、口全都沾满了灰尘。在这些地方肺病非常流行，当工人们病倒而不能工作时，他们就会被驱逐出来而只好听天由命了。
    据我们所知，工人们每天的收入只有一个或一个半卢比，恰够使他们不致饿死，这就是巴基斯坦工人们所过的生活。几天后，我们去了离喀剌蚩十英里的一个小乡村里。一些简陋的茅屋挤聚在光秃而干燥的地面上。它们四周没有任何植物—没有花园，没有菜地，也没有其他的东西。整个村子的面积还不够一公顷。农民住在棕榈叶或粗麻布盖成的棚子里。这村子的牲畜总共只有三头驴。村里的水井就是掘在村子中央的那么一个四公尺深的坑。灰尘、垃圾以及驴子的粪尿等很容易的就流了进去，井水是土黄色的。
    巴基斯坦的土地大约有百分之八十为大地主们所占有，他们把土地租出去。出租制度主要有三种：在第一种制度下，佃户须以所收获的农作物全部给予地主，事实上，佃户不过是一个只有极低微工资的雇佣劳动者。在第二种制度下，佃户要交付收成的四分之三给地主。第三种，佃户亦要把收获物的百分之七十五至八十当作租金给予地主，但是这种租地权是世袭的，同时在若干年内，地主不得驱逐佃户的家庭。
