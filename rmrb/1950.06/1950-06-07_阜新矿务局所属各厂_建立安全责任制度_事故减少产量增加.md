　　【Shenyang News】 Northeast Daily News: In early April, the Fuxin Mining Bureau's affiliated mines conducted a major safety inspection and established a safety responsibility system during the campaign. Sixty percent of the 838 safety problems discovered during the safety inspection have been resolved. As a result, accidents decreased in April and May. The basic reason for the continuous occurrence of accidents in the bureau in the past was lax labor discipline and lack of accountability. For example, the vast majority of accidents in electrical, mechanical, mining and other aspects were caused by sloppy work and failure to comply with safety regulations. There was a lack of strict inspection and specific assistance for safety issues. In the past, many safety-related systems were formulated and safety education was carried out, but they were divorced from reality and were not very effective. At the cadres' meeting on April 21, the bureau studied this issue and decided to combine it with the actual situation to launch a mass movement to establish a safety responsibility system. In the initial stage of in-depth safety inspection in various mines, cadres were repeatedly educated and widespread criticism and self-criticism were carried out; a responsibility system was established at all levels, with each person reporting their scope of work and job responsibilities, and everyone discussing and revising them. Then, according to the bureau's system regulations, a cadre duty manual was formulated so that everyone's work had something to follow. As a result, some cadres said, "This time it's clear, I dare to take responsibility for losing my head." For the workers, the relationship between safety work and the workers' vital interests was emphasized with examples. Some pits used the accidents of the past four months to calculate detailed accounts. Some pits mobilized workers who were disabled due to non-compliance with labor discipline to give lectures to everyone. This approach was very effective. Workers asked to establish a responsibility system, and the establishment of a safety responsibility system initially formed a mass movement. Then, the various responsibility systems and technical regulations formulated by the bureau were handed over to the masses for discussion and revision until everyone thought they were reasonable before they were announced and implemented. During the discussion, the workers demonstrated a high degree of responsibility. For example, the discussion outline of Dongyi Pit of Xinqiu Mine had: "If the hedgehog ball on the coal chute is broken, should the coal miner be responsible?" During the discussion, the workers of the mechanical team automatically proposed: "Our mechanical team is responsible, because the coal miners do not understand these things." As a result of this discussion, responsibilities were clearly defined for everything. In conjunction with this, the administration made some improvements and consolidated the necessary measures for safety work. The mechanical, maintenance, and security team leaders added deputy positions, and someone took care of the work day and night. Mass inspection systems and reward and punishment systems were established.
    After the establishment of various safety systems, accidents decreased in April and May, the contacts between various parties were closer than before, and production efficiency also increased. Liu Yonghe's team in Ping'an Yi Pit broke the quota by one time, the main reason being that the supply of train cars was guaranteed after the establishment of the responsibility system, and the electrical and mechanical equipment guaranteed that the hedgehogs worked well. Most of the working faces meet the specifications, and someone is responsible for the tools and machinery, so the work is in order.
    At present, the bureau is implementing and improving various responsibility systems in order to completely eliminate liability accidents.

    建立安全责任制度  事故减少产量增加
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：阜新矿务局所属各矿，于四月初进行保安大检查，并在运动中建立了安全责任制。在保安检查中发现的八百三十八件安全不良的问题，已有百分之六十获得解决。因此，四、五两月事故已形减少。该局过去事故之所以不断发生，基本原因是劳动纪律松弛和无人负责。如机电、采掘等方面的事故，绝大多数是由于工作马虎，不遵守保安规程造成的。对于安全问题，缺乏严格检查和具体帮助。过去也订过不少保安方面的制度，也进行过保安教育，但都陷于脱离实际，收效不大。该局于四月二十一日干部会议上，研究了这个问题，决定结合实际情况，发动群众性的建立安全责任制运动。各矿在深入保安检查初期，在干部中进行了反复教育，广泛地展开批评自我批评；建立了按级负责制，由各人自报工作范围及工作职责，大家讨论修正，然后根据局的制度规程，制订干部职责手册，使每人的工作都有所遵循。这样一来，有的干部就说：“这回弄清啦，掉脑袋的责任我也敢负了。”对于工人，则用实例强调说明保安工作和工人切身利害的关系。有的坑用四个月来的事故算细账。有的坑动员因不守劳动纪律而残废的工人给大家上课。这种办法收效很大。工人纷纷要求建立责任制，建立安全责任制初步形成了群众运动。接着就把局里制订的各种责任制度、技术规程交群众讨论修改，直到大家认为合理，才公布实行。讨论时工人都发扬了高度负责的精神，如新邱矿东一坑讨论提纲上有：“煤溜子上毛头滚珠坏了，是否应该采煤的负责？”讨论时，机械班工人自动提出：“我们机械班负责，因为采煤工人不懂这些东西。”这样讨论的结果，每件事情都分清了责任。与此结合进行的，是行政上作了某些改进、巩固保安工作的必要措施。机械、整备、保安三班长增设副职，黑、白天工作都有人照顾。群众性的检查制度和奖惩制度建立起来了。
    各种保安制度建立后，四、五两月事故减少，各方面的联系也较前密切，生产效率也有提高。平安一坑刘永和组突破定额一倍，主要原因就是建立责任制后车皮保证了供应，机电保证了毛头好使。大部掌子合乎规格，工具机械有人负责，因此工作井然有序。
    现该局各种责任制正一面实行一面改进，以求彻底消灭责任事故。
