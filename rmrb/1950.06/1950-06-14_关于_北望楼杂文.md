　　About "Northward Gazing Tower Essays"
    Zhou Erfu
    The criticism of "Northward Gazing Tower Essays" published in "Book Review" has been of great help to me.
    Although some of the essays collected in this collection had a slight effect at the time, they were insignificant. Especially with the passage of time, the country has been liberated, the social landscape has been completely renewed, and the targets of criticism no longer exist. These short essays should have been buried with the old era.
    After the liberation of Shanghai, I agreed to compile this booklet after repeated urging from the bookstore. Looking back now, publishing things that are not needed is precisely the result of petty-bourgeois individualism; I originally thought that as long as the content was not seriously flawed, it might still be somewhat useful. In reality, it was just a kind of self-pity.
    I accept the criticism from "Book Review". The first edition of this booklet has already sold out, and I have notified the bookstore not to reprint it.

### 关于“北望楼杂文”

　　关于“北望楼杂文”
    周而复
    “图书评论”上发表对于“北望楼杂文”的批评，给我很大的帮助。
    这个集子所收集的一些杂文，在当时虽然曾经有过微薄的作用，但是很不足道的。尤其是时过境迁，全国解放，社会面目为之一新，针砭对象已不存在，这些短文自应随着旧时代一同埋葬了。
    上海解放后，经书店屡次催促，答应了编成这本小册子。现在想来，把不需要的东西拿来出版，这正是小资产阶级的个人主义做祟；原来以为只要内容没有什么大毛病，大概还会有点作用吧。其实只是一种自谅。
    我接受“图书评论”的批评。这本小册子初版早已卖完，我已通知书店不要再版。
