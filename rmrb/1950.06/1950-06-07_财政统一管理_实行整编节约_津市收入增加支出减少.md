Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th: Tianjin's financial work has begun to achieve the goal of increasing revenue and decreasing expenditures in the past four months. This is the result of the city's implementation of unified financial management, streamlining of staffing, and strict economy. In the past four months, the city has completed and exceeded its planned targets in terms of financial revenue. In addition to the amount remitted to the central government, the amount allocated to the local area also exceeded the original budget. In terms of expenditures, the total expenditures amounted to just over 64 million jin of millet, which is lower than the projected expenditure figure.

The Tianjin Municipal People's Government has done the following important work to improve the financial situation:

First, rectify revenue and establish a revenue management system. In addition to the various taxes collected by the Tax Bureau according to a certain plan, a unified management method has been drafted for various revenues under the control of the Finance Bureau, and unified regulations have been formulated for collection standards, collection types, and treasury deposit systems. For institutions with income, according to the principle of "all income belongs to the Finance Bureau, and all expenditures pass through the Finance Bureau," the past phenomena of each acting on its own, arbitrarily disposing of income, and spontaneous waste have been gradually corrected. In terms of financial management, the planning of expenditure on public services of various units has been strengthened.

Second, implement unified procurement and management methods for materials and supplies. The municipal government has adopted a planned unified procurement, allocation, storage and management method for materials and supplies required for municipal construction. The implementation of the above methods has greatly reduced the waste of manpower and materials in decentralized procurement and storage. At the same time, the municipal government also adjusted the expenditures of various departments according to the different situations of priority, ensuring the specifications of materials and ensuring timely supply.

Third, unify the management of construction projects and reduce waste. The municipal government requires all construction projects in the city to "spend every penny to do one penny's worth of work." Before the start of construction, various projects must be studied from multiple angles to determine construction standards, and then construction can begin after on-site surveys based on the standards. Unnecessary projects will be restricted. For example, painting and plastering projects will be reduced as much as possible when building houses, and efforts will be concentrated on necessary construction projects.

Fourth, establish a unified accounting system and accounting management system. Accounting offices of administrative and public service departments under the municipal government have now generally established financial management systems. In terms of auditing and accounting affairs, except for enterprise departments, other departments are gradually tending towards unification in terms of organization, and their business is beginning to be led by the Municipal Finance Bureau. Unified accounting office organizational procedures, accounting processing procedures, processing methods, and reporting systems have been established, thus improving the efficiency of accounting business in various units.

Fifth, streamline the staffing of administrative departments under the municipal government. First, a Municipal Staffing Committee was established to carry out the work of verifying personnel staffing under the principles of streamlining, saving, reducing administrative personnel, and strengthening business personnel. Overlapping and bloated institutions will be streamlined. It is forbidden to create positions for people, and fixed quotas and staffing are implemented. The Finance Bureau has also formulated personnel supply management methods based on the reviewed and confirmed staffing, and implemented a card system to supply funds by name. In this way, expenditures were saved and work efficiency was improved.

　　财政统一管理·实行整编节约
    津市收入增加支出减少
    【新华社天津四日电】天津市的财政工作最近四个月来已开始达到收入增加和支出减少的目标。这是该市实行财政统一管理、整顿编制和厉行节约的结果。四个月来，该市在财政收入方面已完成并超过了预定任务，除上解中央者外，划留地方的数目亦超过原定预算。支出方面，各项支出共计小米六千四百余万斤，较预定支出数字为低。
    天津市人民政府曾做了以下几项重要工作，以改进财政情况：
    第一是整顿收入，建立收入管理制度。除税务局经收的各种税收仍按照一定计划进行外，凡属财政局掌握的各种收入，都拟订出统一的管理办法，统一规定了征收标准、征收种类以及交库制度等。对于有收入的事业机关，也根据“一切收入归财政局、一切支出通过财政局”的原则，逐渐纠正了过去各自为政、任意支配收入及自流浪费等现象，并在财务管理方面加强了各单位事业费开支的计划性。
    第二是实行材料、物资统一采购、管理办法。市府对全市事业建设所需的材料、物资，采取了有计划的统一采购、拨付、储存保管办法。上述办法的实行大大减少了分散采购和保管中人力物力的浪费现象。同时，市府还按照轻重缓急的不同情况，调节了各部门经费的开支，保证了材料规格，保证了及时供给。
    第三是统一管理修建工程，减少浪费。市府要求全市修建工程都要作到“一个钱定要办一个钱的事”，各项工程于兴工前需经多方研究，定出修建标准，然后根据标准，实地勘查，再行动工。对各种不必要的工程，则加以限制，如修建房屋时油漆、粉刷工程则尽量减少，把力量集中到必要修建的工程上去。
    第四是建立统一的会计系统与会计管理制度。市府所属行政部门与事业部门的会计室机构，现已普遍建立财务管理制度。在审计、会计事务处理上，除企业部门外，其他部门在组织上均逐渐趋于统一，业务上开始受市府财政局领导，并确定了统一的会计室组织规程、会计处理程序、处理方法及表报制度等，因此提高了各单位会计业务的效率。
    第五是整顿市府所属行政部门的编制。首先成立了市编制委员会，在精简节约与减少事务人员、增强业务人员的原则下，进行核定人员编制的工作。对于重叠臃肿的机构，则予以精减。禁止因人设事，实行定员定额。财政局并根据审查确定的编制，订出人事供给管理办法，实行卡片制度，按名供给经费。这样，一面节省了开支，一面也提高了工作效率。
