Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Hebei, Pingyuan, Hunan, Henan, Shandong and other provincial people's governments have deployed measures to prevent summer famine.

　　The Hebei Provincial People's Government issued instructions on May 14th, requiring all subordinate special districts and county governments to establish the idea of long-term production, self-reliance and self-help, and should especially attach importance to agricultural production, ensuring seedling inspection and replanting, to protect planting and ensure harvest. For sideline production that has no prospects or sales, it is necessary to definitively guide its transfer to other industries; for those with prospects and sales, should be planned to support its development; for those that have temporary sales but no prospects, the status quo can be maintained. Sideline production should also be adapted to local conditions and times, and strive for diversity, while opposing blind support and purchase. For the phenomenon of fleeing famine, we should try our best to find ways to persuade and dissuade, so as not to affect production during this production season; for disaster victims who have lost their labor force and have no means of living at present, emergency relief should be carried out immediately.
    
    The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government proposed in the "Several Issues and Preliminary Plan for Long-Term Disaster Relief Work": After the wheat harvest, sideline or handicraft production should continue to be supported, and some water areas can be transferred to water production, but the terrain must be transformed, a certain amount of water must be maintained, and the engineering costs and water crop seeds, rice seedlings, fishing gear, and boats must be resolved. Establish a lake product company to solve the sales of lake products; at the same time, appropriately reduce the burden of public grain in the Huangbin Lake area, so as to enhance the people's ability to resist disasters. For those who have lost their production conditions in their original places, in order to take care of the actual difficulties of more people and less land in Pingyuan, they will be immigrated to the Northeast after the autumn. Families of martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, families of supply-system working cadres, and old, weak, orphaned, and widowed households who have no labor force in the water area, who cannot carry out water production, and who do not have the conditions for immigration, are prepared to be dispersed and resettled in a planned way throughout the province, and given some production capital loans so that they can invest in cooperative mutual aid production and gradually achieve self-sufficiency.

    The Hunan Provincial People's Government emphasized in the "Instructions on Intensifying Spring耕 and Preventing Summer Famine" issued in mid-May: At present, agricultural production should earnestly implement production policies, guarantee whoever plants, whoever harvests, and mobilize the peasant masses to quickly make and apply fertilizer. The instruction put forward the slogan "It is better to cultivate one inch thickly than to cultivate one foot widely." The instructions require governments at all levels and state-owned trading agencies in the province to find ways to help farmers solve the difficulty of lacking fertilizer; people's governments at all levels should strictly protect the耕cattle in disaster areas, and at the same time, organize exchange of labor and mutual assistance under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. Regarding the work of preventing summer floods, the instructions require all localities to quickly and carefully inspect and repair dikes, and prepare necessary equipment, in order to achieve lasting results.

    The Henan Provincial People's Government calls on cadres at all levels to continue to go deep into the countryside, widely publicize the experience and methods of disaster prevention and overcoming famine, to make careful calculations for the disaster victims, and to develop a variety of sideline production in accordance with local conditions and times without hindering the wheat harvest and summer planting. Detailed investigations should be carried out in individual areas newly affected by disasters and non-wheat producing areas, vigorously providing relief and assisting production to prevent fleeing famine.
    
    In addition to allocating 2.7 million catties of relief salt to various disaster areas to solve the salt problem for disaster victims, the Shandong Provincial People's Government has also decided that the province's native products company, cooperative supply and marketing agencies, and other relevant departments should vigorously purchase native products and sideline products, and it is estimated that the purchase price in May and June will reach 50 million catties of millet. In addition, the masses will be organized to sell themselves to promote the development of sideline production.

　　河北等省布置预防夏荒  号召注意长期生产自救
    【新华社四日讯】河北、平原、湖南、河南、山东等省人民政府布置预防夏荒。
    河北省人民政府于五月十四日发出指示，要求所属各专署、县政府树立长期生产自救自助的思想，尤其应重视农业生产，要作到查苗点补、保种保收。对无前途亦无销路的副业生产，要肯定地领导其转业；对有前途有销路者应有计划地扶助其发展；暂时有销路而无前途者，可以维持现状。对副业生产并要因地因时制宜，力求多样性，同时反对盲目的扶植与收购。对于逃荒现象，应该尽量想出办法，说服劝阻，以免在此生产季节中，影响生产；对丧失劳力目前生活无着的灾民，应立即进行急赈。
    平原省人民政府在“长期救灾工作中的几个问题及初步方案”中提出：麦收后仍应继续扶持副业或手工业生产，一部分水区可转入水上生产，但必须改造地形，保持一定水量，并解决工程费用和水上作物的种子、秧田、渔具、船只等困难。建立湖产公司，解决湖产销路；同时适当减轻临黄滨湖地区之公粮负担，以便增强人民群众的抗灾能力。对原地丧失生产条件者，为照顾平原人多地少的实际困难，将在秋后向东北移民。水区无劳力的烈士家属、革命军人家属和供给制工作干部家属与老、弱、孤、寡户，既不能进行水上生产，又不具备移民条件，准备在全省范围内进行有计划地分散安置，并贷给部分生产资本，以便使其投入合作互助生产，逐步地达到自给。
    湖南省人民政府于五月中旬发布的“加紧春耕防备夏荒的指示”中着重指出：目前农业生产应切实贯彻生产政策，保证谁种谁收，并发动农民群众迅速制肥施肥。指示提出“宽作一尺，不如厚作一寸”的口号。指示要求该省各级政府与国营贸易机关应设法帮助农民解决缺乏肥料的困难；各级人民政府应严格保护灾区耕牛，同时在群众自愿互利原则下，组织换工互助。关于防备夏汛的工作，指示要求各地应迅速认真检查，修补堤坝，准备必要器材，以期作到一劳永逸。
    河南省人民政府号召各级干部继续深入农村，广泛宣传防灾与度荒的经验和办法，替灾民精打细算，在不妨碍麦收、夏种的原则下，因地、因时制宜；开展多种多样的副业生产。对个别新遭灾害的地区及非产麦区应详细调查，大力救济并扶助生产，以防止逃荒。
    山东省人民政府除已分配各灾区救济盐二百七十万斤，解决了灾民食盐问题外，并决定由该省土产公司、合作供销处等有关部门大力收购土产和副业产品，预计五、六两个月收购价款可达小米五千万斤。此外再组织群众自销，以促进副业生产的发展。
