Xinhua News Agency, June 29th, Tokyo: Akahata newspaper's registered publisher, Masaharu Matsumoto, and seven others visited Mitsusada Yoshikawa, Director of the Special Examination Bureau of the Legal Affairs Bureau of the Yoshida government on the 27th to protest the Yoshida government's illegal measure, based on MacArthur's instructions, to order Akahata newspaper to suspend publication for 30 days starting on the 27th.
	On the one hand, MacArthur said in his instructions that the suspension order for Akahata would be implemented from the 27th; but on the other hand, he instructed the Japanese police to unreasonably confiscate Akahata newspapers published before the 27th. According to a United Press report, Tokyo police confiscated the remaining Akahata newspapers published on the 25th and some of the newspapers published on the 26th that had not yet been distributed from the Akahata newspaper office. In other areas, the police also confiscated the newspaper in large quantities. According to Kyodo News, the National Local Police Headquarters of the Yoshida government received information that, as of 1:00 PM on the 27th, the total number of Akahata newspapers confiscated by the prefectural headquarters had reached more than 93,000 copies.

　　赤旗报发行人松本正治抗议麦克阿瑟非法措施
    日警竟又无理没收停刊前的赤旗报
    【新华社二十九日讯】东京讯：日本共产党机关报赤旗报登记发行人松本正治等八人，于二十七日访吉田政府法务府特别审查局局长吉河光贞，对吉田政府根据麦克阿瑟的指令，勒令赤旗报自二十七日起停刊三十天的非法措施，提出抗议。
    麦克阿瑟一方面在他的指令中说：对赤旗报的停刊令自二十七日开始执行；但另一方面，他又指使日本警察无理地没收二十七日以前出版的赤旗报。据合众社讯，东京警察在赤旗报馆没收了剩余的二十五日出版的赤旗报，以及一部分未及发行的二十六日出版的该报。在其他地区，警察也大批没收该报。据共同社讯，据吉田政府国家地方警察本部接获的情报，迄二十七日下午一时为止，各县本部没收的赤旗报，共达九万三千余份。
