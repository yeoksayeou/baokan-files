　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th: The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, and the Northeast Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and other organizations have issued statements protesting the despicable behavior of American imperialism in persecuting the Japanese Communist Party. They also stated that they will actively support the just struggle of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people against American imperialists. The ongoing Second Shenyang Municipal People's Representatives Conference also unanimously passed a statement expressing support and condolences to the Japanese Communist Party and the patriotic Japanese people who are persevering in their struggle.
　　[Our Newspaper] To protest the persecution of the Japanese Communist Party by American imperialism and to support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people for peace and democracy, the Peking University Student Union issued a statement saying:
　　"The frantic atrocities of the American imperialists and their running dog, the Yoshida Cabinet, in persecuting the Japanese people, have seriously violated the Potsdam Declaration of 1945, fully demonstrating that American imperialism is severely suppressing the great movement of the Japanese people to fight for democracy and liberation, attempting to launch a new war of aggression, and undermining the peace and happiness of all mankind.
　　The people of the whole world are convinced that such conspiratorial behavior by the American imperialists will inevitably meet with a painful defeat. The unbreakable united strength of the peace-loving and democratic people of the world is growing stronger day by day, and the great strength of the Japanese people's democratic struggle combined with the worldwide movement for peace and democracy will surely bring about a glorious victory for the Japanese people's revolutionary struggle.
　　Japanese youth and students have always bravely stood at the forefront of the Japanese people, and under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, have been waging an unyielding struggle against the American imperialists together with the Japanese people. We, the students of Peking University in China, like the hundreds of millions of people throughout China, are always concerned and watching the democratic movement of the Japanese people. We will always be the loyal comrades-in-arms of the Japanese people and Japanese democratic youth in their struggle! We solemnly protest the illegal actions of MacArthur, the American imperialist, and fully support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people."

    【本报讯】北京大学学生会为了抗议美帝对日本共产党的迫害，支持日本人民争取和平民主的英勇斗争，发表声明称：
    “美帝国主义者及其走狗吉田内阁迫害日本人民的疯狂暴行，严重地破坏了一九四五年的波茨坦宣言，充分说明了美帝国主义正在严酷地镇压日本人民争取民主和解放的伟大运动，企图发动新的侵略战争，破坏全世界人类的和平和幸福。

    日本青年学生，一向是勇敢地站在日本人民的前列，在日本共产党的领导之下，和日本人民一道向美帝进行着不屈不挠的斗争。我们，中国北京大学的学生，和全中国的亿万人民一样，时时刻刻在关怀注视着日本人民的民主运动。我们将永远是日本人民和日本民主青年在斗争中的忠诚战友！我们郑重抗议美帝麦克阿瑟的非法行动，并以全力支持日本人民的英勇斗争。”
