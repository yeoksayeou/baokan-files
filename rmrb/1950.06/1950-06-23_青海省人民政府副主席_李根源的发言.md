Qinghai Provincial People's Government Vice Chairman
    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd] Xirao Jiacuo (Tibetan), Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, delivered the speech below at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 21st: Chairman, fellow committee members, ladies and gentlemen:
    I am extremely excited to be summoned here to Beijing to attend the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, representing the Tibetan people of the Northwest. On behalf of the Tibetan people of the Northwest, I would like to extend my highest respect and warmest congratulations to the conference!
    Chairman Mao's opening speech at the conference, and the detailed reports on land reform, finance, economy, politics, military affairs, culture and education, the courts, etc., all represent the interests of the broad masses of the people. The care taken for the minority nationalities in all aspects can be said to be meticulous. This will further increase the unity between all nationalities and consolidate our confidence in the complete victory of the revolution!
    In his report on the central topic of this conference, "the issue of land reform," Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi took into account the actual situation in minority areas where land reform conditions were not yet mature, and specifically stipulated in the new draft "Land Reform Law" that "this law does not apply to minority areas," giving all minority nationalities more time to consider and prepare for their internal land reform issues. This is also completely correct and entirely necessary, and in line with the interests of the minority nationalities. Premier Zhou's political report pointed out that the government has decided to allocate special funds to develop the economy and culture of minority nationalities and respect freedom of religious belief. These are concrete manifestations of the government's assistance to minority nationalities, and are great measures that are extremely supported and appreciated by our minority nationalities. From the standpoint of minority nationalities, we are unspeakably moved by such care and assistance from the government! We minority nationalities must deeply recognize this great policy of the government and unite more closely with our Han compatriots to strive for the complete realization of our common goals of all nationalities -- an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous and strong new China!
    The other reports on military affairs, finance, economy, culture, education, and the courts also take special care of the interests of minority nationalities. Here, on behalf of the Tibetan people of the Northwest, I express my complete support for the various reports of the conference.
    Thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the unanimous support of the people throughout the country, the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people has achieved victory throughout the country, except for Tibet and Taiwan which are yet to be liberated. In all the liberated areas, the old feudalism, exploitation, and oppression have been basically eliminated. The government work cadres and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who are responsible for these revolutionary tasks have a high spirit of serving the people. They are not greedy or corrupt, they live frugally, and they understand the sufferings of the people. The cadres working in the minority areas of the Northwest have shown close unity and mutual assistance between fraternal nationalities. In addition, the government has been rigorously streamlining, practicing economy, and making careful calculations in order to reduce the burden on the people. All of this shows that today's government is of the people, so it is always thinking for the people. This fact greatly encourages the broad masses of the people (including the minority nationalities) to firmly trust and support the government!
    However, our victory and unity are not what the enemy wants, because our victory and unity means the enemy's demise, and the enemy is not willing to perish. Therefore, we must always be vigilant and strictly guard against all the rumors, deceptions, and divisive conspiracies carried out by imperialism and the people's enemies, special agents, etc. within our midst. Only in this way can we consolidate our great family of friendly cooperation among all nationalities.
    The long-term scheming aggression of British and American imperialists against Tibet is well known. Currently, they are carrying out conspiracies to divide our national unity. However, the Chinese people have long solemnly declared that Tibet is an indivisible part of the entire Chinese territory, the Tibetan people are an important member of the great family of Chinese nationalities, the Tibetan people have the right to ask fraternal nationalities to help them liberate themselves from imperialist aggression, and fraternal nationalities have the responsibility and obligation to help liberate Tibet and the Tibetan people!
    The ethnic and religious issues of Tibet are inseparable. The majority of Tibetans believe in Lamaism, that is, Buddhism. British and American imperialist elements have seized on this point and spread rumors, conspiring to create doubts among the Tibetan people about the people's government and the Communist Party's policy of freedom of religious belief. It cannot be denied that there are still some shortcomings in our past work that need to be corrected in the future. However, the policy of freedom of religious belief of the people's government and the Communist Party, according to my long-term personal experience, especially the protection of Lama temples by the People's Liberation Army after the liberation of Qinghai, proves to be firm and unwavering. Therefore, I have twice broadcast to Tibet from Qinghai, explaining that the people's government firmly implements the policy of freedom of religious belief stipulated in the Common Program, that the Communist Party not only does not oppose religion, but also protects religion, so that facts can shatter all the rumors and deceptions of imperialism and reactionaries!
    I deeply believe that the Han and Tibetan nationalities, which have a long history of cultural relations and traditional friendship, and other fraternal nationalities in the country will surely unite closely, smash all the conspiracies and tricks of British and American imperialists, and build our new China!
    The liberation of the Tibetan people is not far off. Let us shout:
    Long live the great unity of all nationalities in China!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities in China!
    Long live the permanent peace of the world!

    青海省人民政府副主席
    【新华社二十二日讯】青海省人民政府副主席喜饶嘉措（藏族）二十一日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    本人此次应召代表西北藏民来京列席人民政协首届全国委员会第二次会议，感到非常兴奋，我谨代表西北的藏族人民向大会致以崇高的敬礼和热烈的庆祝！
    大会毛主席的开幕词，和土改、财经、政治、军事、文教、法院等各项详尽的报告，都代表着广大人民的利益，对于少数民族各方面的照顾更可以说是无微不至，这就更会增加各民族之间的团结，和巩固革命彻底胜利的信心！
    刘少奇副主席在关于此次大会的中心议题“土改问题”的报告中，照顾到少数民族地区土改条件尚未成熟的实际情况，并在新的“土地改革法”草案中特别明文规定了“本法不适用于少数民族地区”，给各少数民族以更多的时间来考虑并准备其内部的土地改革问题，这也是完全正确，和完全必要，符合于少数民族人民利益的。周总理的政治报告，指出了政府决定拿出一笔专款来发展少数民族的经济、文化，尊重宗教信仰自由，这些都是政府扶助少数民族的具体表现，是我们少数民族所极端拥护并感谢的伟大措施。站在少数民族的立场上，对于政府的这种照顾和扶助，实使我们感到有说不出的感奋！我们少数民族必须深刻的认识政府这种伟大的政策，要更加亲密的和汉族同胞团结起来，为彻底实现我们各民族的共同目标——独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国而奋斗！
    其他军事、财经、文教法院等各项报告也无不特别照顾到少数民族的利益，这里，我谨代表西北藏族人民对大会的各项报告表示完全的拥护。
    由于中国人民领袖毛主席的正确领导，人民解放军的英勇作战，和全国人民的一致拥护与支持，目前除西藏、台湾尚待解放外，中国人民的革命事业已在全国范围内取得了胜利。在所有的解放区都基本上扫除了旧日的封建，剥削和压迫，担负这些革命工作任务的政府工作干部，和人民解放军的全体指战员，都具有高度为人民服务的精神，他们不贪污，不腐化，节衣缩食，体会人民的疾苦。在西北少数民族地区工作的干部，更表现了兄弟民族之间的亲密团结与互助。此外，政府为了减轻人民的负担，更厉行整编节约，精打细算，这一切都说明今天的政府是人民的，所以它处处都是为人民打算。这样的事实就大大的鼓舞了广大人民（少数民族人民在内）对于政府的坚决信赖和拥护！
    但是，我们的胜利和团结，敌人是不甘心的，因为我们的胜利和团结，就是敌人的灭亡，而敌人是不甘心灭亡的。因此，我们就必须要随时提高警惕，严防帝国主义及各民族内部的人民公敌，特务分子等在我们中间所进行的一切造谣欺骗、挑拨离间的阴谋活动。这样，才能巩固我们各民族友爱合作的大家庭。
    英美帝国主义者对于西藏的处心积虑长期侵略，是大家所熟知的，目前，它们正在进行着分裂我们民族团结的阴谋，但是，中国人民很早就已经庄严的宣布过：西藏是整个中国领土不容分割的一部分，西藏人民是组成中国各民族大家庭中重要的一员，西藏人民有要求各兄弟民族帮助他们从帝国主义侵略下解放出来的权利，各兄弟民族也有帮助解放西藏和西藏人民的责任和义务！
    西藏的民族问题和宗教问题是分不开的，大多数藏民信奉喇嘛教，即是佛教，英、美帝国主义分子便抓住了这一点，散布谣言，阴谋企图造成西藏人民对于人民政府及共产党宗教信仰自由政策的疑惧，不容讳言，在我们过去的工作中，是还存在一些缺点，亟待今后的纠正；但人民政府、共产党的宗教信仰自由的政策，据我长期亲身的体会，特别是青海解放后人民解放军对于喇嘛寺庙的保护，证明是坚定不移的，所以我在青海时曾两度向西藏广播，说明人民政府坚决执行共同纲领中所规定的宗教信仰自由政策，共产党不仅不反对宗教，而且保护宗教，让事实粉碎帝国主义及反动派的一切造谣欺骗！
    我深深相信有着悠久的历史文化关系及传统友谊的汉、藏两大民族及国内其它兄弟民族一定会亲密的团结在一起，粉碎英、美帝国主义者的一切阴谋诡计，建设我们的新中国！
    西藏人民的解放为期不会很远了。让我们高呼：
    中国各民族大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    全世界的永久和平万岁！
