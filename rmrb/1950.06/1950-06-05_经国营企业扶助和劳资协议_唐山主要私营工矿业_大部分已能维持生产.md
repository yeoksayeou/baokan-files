Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 3rd. With assistance from state-owned enterprises and labor-management agreements, most major private industrial and mining enterprises in Tangshan have been able to maintain production, weathering temporary difficulties.

　　Kailuan Coal Mine, the largest coal mine in North China, signed a purchase and sales contract with the state-owned China Coal Industry Building Materials Company in April, valid until the end of the year. The contract stipulates that all Kailuan products, except those retained for self-use and self-sale, will be purchased and sold by China Coal Industry Building Materials Company. Due to the signing of the purchase and sales contract, the serious difficulty of the mine's long-term accumulation of products that could not be sold has been overcome. Qixin Cement Company signed a one-year purchase and sales contract with the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government as early as last October. The purchase and sales volume is 10,000 tons per month, accounting for more than 90% of Qixin's monthly output. The joint state-private Hua Xin Cotton Mill signed a processing contract with the state-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company from March to the end of the year. The contract stipulates that all of Hua Xin's products will be delivered to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, which will provide sufficient raw cotton and pay processing fees. Nine factories in the private oil pressing industry signed processing contracts with the state-owned Oils and Fats Company in April, receiving 440,000 jin of raw materials from the latter. The factories in this industry had suspended work due to a lack of raw materials, but have now resumed production. Many private merchants are conducting purchases on behalf of the Oils and Fats Company, etc. For example, of the 500,000 jin of peanuts purchased by the company in April, more than half were purchased by private merchants.

　　The state-owned enterprises' regulations on processing profits for industrial and mining enterprises and small and medium-sized industries are determined through consultation between the two parties, based on the principle of "taking into account both public and private interests and developing production." For example, the oil pressing processing fee is determined on the one hand according to the domestic and foreign market prices of oil, and on the other hand according to the actual expenses of each factory for wages, factory buildings, machinery, electricity, etc., with a processing fee of 5 to 6 jin of rice per hundred jin of raw materials pressed. The processing factories are all satisfied with these conditions.

　　As for industries such as ceramics, which are facing relatively serious temporary difficulties, many ways to overcome the difficulties have been determined through agreements between labor and management. For example, workers at the Qinghecheng Porcelain Factory have voluntarily reduced their wages. In addition to completing their daily work, staff members are participating in odd jobs to save on the expense of hiring temporary workers. Some porcelain factory employees have adopted a shift work system, with some unemployed workers temporarily returning home to reduce the employer's expenses and help the employer maintain production. Employees of the Zhonghua Oil Pressing Factory suggested that the factory reasonably adjust the labor organization, and four of the eight staff members participated in direct production work. As a result of the increase in direct production personnel, the factory was able to divide production into day and night shifts, increasing output by 125%, thereby greatly reducing product costs.

    唐山主要私营工矿业  大部分已能维持生产
    【新华社保定三日电】唐山市主要私营工矿业，经国营企业扶助和劳资协议，大部已能维持生产，度过暂时困难。
    华北最大的煤矿开滦煤矿已在四月份与国营中国煤业建筑器材公司签订了截至年底为止的购销合同。合同规定开滦产品除留出自用自销者外，全部由中国煤业建筑器材公司购销。由于购销合同的订立，该矿过去长期积存产品不能销售的严重困难已被克服。启新洋灰公司早在去年十月即已与中央人民政府贸易部签订了为期一年的购销合同。购销数量为每月一万吨，占启新月产量的百分之九十以上。公私合营的华新纱厂和国营花纱布公司签订了自三月到年底的加工合同。合同规定华新的产品全部交付花纱布公司，后者供给足够的原棉和付出加工费。私营榨油业中有九家工厂于四月份与国营油脂公司签订了加工合同，得到后者拨付的原料四十四万斤。该业各厂曾因原料缺乏而停工，现在已重新恢复了生产。不少私商代油脂公司等进行收购。如该公司四月份收购的五十万斤花生米中，就有一半以上是由私商代收的。
    国营企业对工矿业及中小工业加工利润之规定，是经过双方协商，根据“公私兼顾，发展生产”原则确定的。如榨油加工费就是一方面根据油的国内外市场价格，另一方面又根据各厂的工资、厂房、机器、电力等实际开支而规定的，每榨百斤原料付加工费折米五至六斤。各加工工厂对于这样的条件都表示满意。
    至于暂时困难比较严重的陶瓷等业，经过劳资双方协议，已定出许多克服困难的办法。如庆和成磁厂工人已自动减薪。职员们除完成日常工作外，参加作零活，以节省雇用临时工的开支。有的磁厂职工采取轮班工作制，一部没有工作的工人暂时回家，以便减少资方开支，帮助资方把生产维持下来。中华榨油厂职工，建议厂方合理调整劳动组织后，八个职员中有四个参加了直接生产工作。由于直接生产人员增加，该厂得以分为昼、夜两班生产，使产量提高了百分之一百二十五，产品成本因而大为减低。
