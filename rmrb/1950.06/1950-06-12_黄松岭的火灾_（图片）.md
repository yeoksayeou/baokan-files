    "The Fire at Huangsongling"
    Su Jian's calligraphy, Ma Xun's poem
    (Twenty-Four)
    The People's Liberation Army stationed at the foot of the mountain, and the common people,
    All went into action upon hearing the news.
    Seeing the fire burning towards the forest,
    They quickly applied strategy:
    Some cut grass,
    Some cut trees,
    Some dug paths.
    Wooden sticks, iron shovels, brooms...many people,
    And quite a few weapons too.
    Sure enough, as the fire rushed in,
    They annihilated the great enemy in front of the forest,
    In a burst of heroic fighting!
    (Twenty-Five)
    The lumber yard, the forestry station... all were burned to ruins.
    The workers burned their clothes and scorched their faces!
    Everyone watched in silence,
    Without a single word.
    Ah, what words could they use to express the grief that filled their chests?
    This vast property of the motherland;
    The blood and sweat of years of labor!
    The director's cane wound throbbed intensely!
    Exhausted,
    He suddenly collapsed,
    Feeling dizzy.
    The workers stepped forward to help him up.
    Old Zhao looked at him anxiously,
    His eyes seemed to say:
    "Remember this painful lesson,
    --Your carelessness, your apathy,
    --You don't consult with everyone when you do things!"
    The director grasped Old Zhao's hand,
    Ten thousand words stuck in his throat.
    After a long while, he slowly opened his mouth:
    "I, I was wrong..."
    Tears flowed like a spring, down his face!
    (Twenty-Six)
    Yan Guaitou was caught,
    And sent to the government for investigation!
    The director was dismissed,
    And told to examine the root of his mistakes!
    The new Huangsongling Forestry Station,
    Under the leadership of the new director Zhao Jinglin,
    --Begins to rebuild!
    (The End)

    “黄松岭的火灾”
    苏坚书  马寻诗
    （二十四）
    驻在山下的解放军，还有老百姓，
    大家闻讯，都一齐出动。
    他们看到火势向森林燃烧，
    便迅速地应用了战略：
    割草的割草，
    砍树的砍树，
    挖道的挖道。
    木棒、铁铲、扫帚……人多，
    武器也真不少。
    果然，火一扑到，
    被他们一阵英勇的厮杀，
    在森林的前面把大敌歼灭了！
    （二十五）
    楞场，林务所……都被大火烧成废丘一片。
    工友们烧坏了衣裳，又烧伤了脸！
    大家默默的看着，
    话都没有一句。
    是啊，他们用甚么话才能说出他们填胸的悲痛？
    这浩大的祖国财产；
    这几年的劳动的血汗！
    所长的棍伤剧烈发痛！
    他又疲倦不堪，
    突然在倒地上，
    感到头昏目眩。
    工友上前把他扶起。
    老赵紧张地望着他，
    眼光像说这样的话：
    “记信这沉痛的教训，
    ——你马虎、麻痹，
    ——你办事不和大家合计！
    所长握住老赵的手，
    万句话堵上了咽喉。
    半天，他才缓缓的开了口：
    “我，我错了……”
    眼泪像泉水，在脸上流！
    （二十六）
    阎怪头被抓到了，
    送到政府查办！
    所长被撤职了，
    要他检讨错误的根源！
    新的黄松岭的林务所，
    在新所长赵景林领导下，
    ——开始重建！
    （完）
