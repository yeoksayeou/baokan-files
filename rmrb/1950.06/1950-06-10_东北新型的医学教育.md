　　New Type of Medical Education in Northeast China
　　By our reporter Jin Feng

　　I. From Yan'an to Northeast China

　　There are currently four higher medical schools in Northeast China, namely, China Medical University in Shenyang, Harbin Medical University, Changchun Military Medical University, and the Medical College of Dalian University. Except for the Medical College of Dalian University, the first three schools are all derived from the China Medical University system. The predecessor of China Medical University was Yan'an China Medical University. During the land revolution era, it was called the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Health School in the Central Soviet Area. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was called the Eighth Route Army Military Medical School. In 1940, it moved to Yan'an and was renamed China Medical University. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it moved to Zhangjiakou. In 1946, it moved to Xingshan in Northeast China to establish the main campus. In order to train a large number of health cadres needed in the Liberation War, three branch schools were established in various parts of Northeast China. After the liberation of the entire Northeast China in 1949, the main campus moved to Shenyang, and the branch schools were adjusted and merged to establish Harbin and Changchun Medical Universities. They are consistent in terms of educational policy, academic system, curriculum, and teaching methods.

　　From the Central Soviet Area to Yan'an, and from Yan'an to Northeast China, the teaching of China Medical University has strictly served the revolutionary struggle at each stage. In those difficult and tense days, the teaching staff of China Medical University, according to the needs of the war (such as war trauma surgery, internal medicine, wartime infectious diseases, etc.), determined the key teaching content and implemented practical teaching methods. Therefore, they were able to train thousands upon thousands of health cadres for the People's Liberation Army in the shortest possible time, directly and indirectly supporting the revolutionary war.

　　After arriving in Northeast China, China Medical University supplemented a group of teachers and equipment from the puppet Manchukuo era, which expanded the scale of the school. On the other hand, in the early days of entering the big city, the school was once influenced by the old-style medical education: for example, some professors lectured solely based on personal interests instead of starting from actual needs, the teaching content was complicated and empty, and unrealistic; some professors read aloud from books during class, and the students became recording machines, forming a dogmatic phenomenon in which theory was divorced from practice. After discovering these problems, the school leaders immediately led all professors to conduct political study, led ideological remoulding, and after studying Chairman Mao's documents such as "Reform Our Study," "Oppose Party Stereotypes," and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the professors began to realize the serious harm of dogmatism, thereby turning to a new direction. Under the direct leadership of the Health Department of the Northeast Military Region, based on decades of revolutionary medical education experience and absorbing the advantages of the old medical education, from the second half of 1947, China Medical University began to implement a specialist key-point-based teaching plan, a teaching method that unifies theory and practice, and collective unified teaching organization work.

　　Since then, the entire academic system of China Medical University has changed with the development of the revolutionary situation: from one-year, two-year, and three-year systems to the new regular five-year system stipulated at the end of last year. The content of the specialist key-point-based education plan and image teaching method has also been enriched and enriched day by day.

　　II. Consistent Specialist Key-Point System for Teaching

　　The specialist key-point system is formulated under the major premise of planned and purposeful training of various medical talents to serve the current revolutionary struggle and the needs of the people. When it was first implemented in 1947, the overriding task of China Medical University was still to supply military doctors to the front lines. Therefore, the specialist key-point system was reflected in the enrollment aspect, which was determined by the ratio of six to two to one for recruiting students in surgery, internal medicine, and otolaryngology according to the battlefield's needs for doctors in various departments; in terms of curriculum, it was based on the principle of "preparatory courses (such as biology, physics, and chemistry) obeying basic courses (such as physiology, pathology, etc.), basic courses obeying clinical practice, and clinical practice obeying the needs of war," the key points of each course and the proportion between them were determined, so that after students learned the same preparatory courses and basic courses, they would learn clinical courses with different focuses according to the specialty they studied.

　　In 1949, the entire Northeast China was liberated and began to transition to peaceful construction. China Medical University and all medical schools faced the following facts: based on the statistics of one doctor needed for every thousand people, China needs 475,000 doctors; however, there are only about 20,000 formal doctors in the country. China currently lacks more than 400,000 doctors. In order to train a large number of excellent medical talents in a timely manner, China Medical University has implemented a five-year specialist key-point teaching system since the second semester of last year. This is based on the principle of "specialization on the basis of systematic theoretical knowledge." Students spend the first two years learning basic medical courses, the next two years focusing on learning a clinical major, supplemented by necessary clinical ancillary courses, and the last year focusing on specialized practice.

　　III. Image Teaching Method and Specialized Teaching Group

　　The image teaching method, which was gradually conceived in the war along with the specialist key-point system, is an indispensable teaching method to ensure the implementation of the specialist key-point system. Contrary to the past dogmatic teaching method of separating theory from practice, the image teaching method fully utilizes specimens, models, charts, animal experiments, clinical cases, and other actual facts to inspire students to think and explain the laws of objective things; students conduct experiments and internships themselves under the specific guidance of teachers to falsify and enrich the content of the theory. For example, when lecturing on physiology, the professor gives the main lecture, and teaching assistants and graduate students cooperate to demonstrate experiments, showing various physiological changes, so that students can understand the theory through practice. When explaining anatomy, the professor performs anatomical demonstrations on corpses, and uses various specimens, model charts to supplement the explanation, and also draws anatomical surface lines on living bodies, and finally allows students to perform dissections themselves, so that they can falsify the theory in actual operation.

　　The specialized teaching group is a part of the new teaching system and is the basic-level teaching organization. It organizationally guarantees and continuously improves and enriches the image teaching method and the specialist key-point system, and plays a role in training and improving teachers. It is organized by department and includes all educators within the department—professors, teaching assistants, graduate students, etc. They all carry out teaching research under the leadership of the department director: improving teaching, researching teaching plans, teaching progress, internship content, unifying terminology, etc. They also listen to each other's lectures, criticize each other, and help each other, so as to improve teaching effectiveness and enrich teaching content.

　　IV. An Interesting Exam

　　When this series of new teaching systems, methods, and organizations began to be implemented in Northeast China, they encountered many misunderstandings, criticisms, and doubts. The most important of these was the fear that such methods would reduce the quality of teaching.

　　In September 1948, a comparative examination of students under two different education systems was held at the main campus of China Medical University. The examinees were graduates and dropouts from old-style regular medical education systems such as Changchun and Shenyang Medical Colleges who had studied for six or seven years, and surgery students who graduated after studying for one year under the China Medical University specialist key-point system. The results showed that China Medical University students scored an average of 83.7 points in basic courses and 82.1 points in later clinical courses; while those medical university students who had studied for six or seven years scored an average of 31 points in basic courses and 24 points in later clinical courses.

　　This comparative examination fully proved the merits and demerits of the two systems. Now that the study time at China Medical University has been extended to five years, the advantages of the new system will be even more apparent.

　　Many medical schools in Guan Nei, such as the Second Field Army Medical University, Central China Medical College, and North China Medical University, have adopted these new methods. Peking University Medical College, Kunming Medical College, Guiyang Medical College, and Southwest University are also preparing to implement them. The East China region sent two visiting delegations to Northeast China to visit and prepare to go back to study and start implementation. This year, more than 20 medical and health experts and scholars who participated in the National Conference of Scientific Research Workers in Health formed a delegation to visit Northeast China, and they all expressed praise. For example, Mr. Huang Jianbai said: "Specialist education can improve 'quality' and not just solve the problem of 'quantity.' Our on-the-spot investigation in Northeast China has fully proved this. However, there are still a few people who doubt these methods, thinking that this is only for 'quantity' and not for 'quality,' and does not conform to regular medical standards; it can be seen that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have not yet fully taken root in the old medical education circles, which is worthy of our deep reflection."

　　东北新型的医学教育
    本报记者  金凤
    一、从延安到东北
    东北现有四个高等医科学校，即沈阳中国医科大学、哈尔滨医科大学、长春军医大学和大连大学医学院。除大连大学医学院以外，前三个学校都是由前中国医大总校这个系统分出来的。中国医大的前身是延安中国医科大学，土地革命时代在中央苏区叫工农红军卫生学校，抗战初期叫八路军军医学校，一九四○年迁到延安，改称中国医科大学，抗战胜利后迁张家口，一九四六年迁东北兴山成立总校。为大批培养解放战争中所需之卫生干部起见，在东北各地设立了三个分校。一九四九年东北全境解放后，总校迁沈阳，并就各分校调整合并，成立了哈尔滨、长春两医科大学。它们在教育方针、学制、课程、教法等各方面都是一致的。
    从中央苏区到延安，从延安到东北，中国医大的教学都是严格地服务于每一阶段的革命斗争的。在那些艰难、紧张的日子里，中国医大的教学工作人员，根据战争的需要（例如战伤外科、及内科、战时传染病等），确定了有重点的教学内容，实行了切合实际的教学法。因此他们能在最短的时间内，为人民解放军培养出成千成万的卫生干部，直接间接地支援了革命战争。
    到了东北以后的中国医大，补充了一批伪满时代的师资和设备，使学校的规模扩大了。另一方面，该校也就在这进入大城市的初期，曾一度受了旧型医学教育的影响：如某些教授不从实际需要出发而单凭个人兴趣讲学，教学内容庞杂空洞，不切实际；有些教授上课时照书本宣读，学生们就做记录的机器，形成了理论与实际脱节的教条主义现象。该校领导方面发现了这些问题后，立即领导全校教授进行政治学习，领导进行思想改造，教授们在学习了毛主席《改造我们的学习》，《反对党八股》，《文艺座谈会的讲话》等文件后，开始认识到教条主义的危害性的严重，从而转向新的方向。在东北军区卫生部的直接领导下，根据数十年革命的医学教育的经验，并吸收了旧医学教育的优点，从一九四七年下半年起，中国医大开始实行了专科重点制的教学计划、理论与实际一致的教学方法和集体统一的教学组织工作。
    此后，中国医大的整个学制，随着革命形势的发展而有过改变：由一年制、两年制、三年制到去年年底规定的新型正规的五年制。专科重点制的教育计划和形象教学法的内容也随之日渐充实和丰富起来。
    二、教学用一致的专科重点制
    专科重点制是在有计划、有目的地培养各种医务人材以服务于当前的革命斗争和人民需要的大前提下面制订的。一九四七年开始实行时，为前方供应军医还是中国医大压倒一切的任务，因此专科重点制表现在招生方面的，就是根据战场对于各科医生的需要，确定了六比二比一的招收外科、内科和五官科的学生的比例；表现在课程方面，是根据“预科课程（如生物、理、化等）服从基础课程（如生理、病理等），基础课程服从临床，临床服从战争需要”的原则，确定了各科课程的重点和相互间的比重，使学生在学了相同的预科课程及基础课程后，就按所学的专科而学习不同重点的临床课程。
    一九四九年东北全境解放，开始转入和平建设，中国医大以及一切医科学校面临着如下的事实：以一千个人需要一个医生作统计，中国共需四十七万五千个医生；而全国现有正式医生不过两万左右。中国目前缺少医生四十万以上。中国医大为了及时培养大批优秀医务人材，故从去年下学期起实行了五年制的专科重点教学制度。这就是根据“在系统的理论知识基础上实行专门化”的原则，学生头两年学习医学基础课程，后两年重点学习一门临床主科，配以必要的各种临床辅科，最后一年则进行重点专科实习。
    三、形象教学法和专科教学小组
    和专科重点制一起从战争中逐渐孕育而成的形象教学法是保证实行专科重点制不可缺少的教学法。和过去理论脱离实际的教条主义的教学法相反，形象教学法充分利用标本、模型、图表、动物实验、临床病例等实际事实来启发同学思考，来讲解客观事物的规律；同学们在教师们的具体指导下，自己动手做实验和实习，以反证和丰富理论的内容。譬如讲生理学时，教授一面主讲，助教、研究生等就在一旁配合作实验示教，表现出生理上各种变化，使学生通过实际来认识理论。讲解剖时教授在尸体上作解剖示教，并用各种标本、模型图表来补充说明，而且在活体上画解剖的表线，最后又让学生动手解剖，使他们在实际操作中来反证理论。
    专科教学小组，是新的教学系统中的一部分，是教学的基层组织。它在组织上保证着和不断改进充实着形象教学法和专科重点制，并起着培养和提高师资的作用。它是以系科为单位组成的，包括系科内所有教育人员——教授、讲助教、研究生等。他们都在系科主任领导下展开教学研究：改进教学、研究教学方案、教学进度、实习内容、统一名词等。彼此并相互听课，相互批评，相互帮助，这样来提高教学效果和丰富教学内容。
    四、一个有趣的考试
    这一系列的新的教学制度，方法和组织，在东北开始推行时，遭遇到不少的误解、责难与怀疑。其中最主要的是怕这样的办法会降低了教学质量。
    一九四八年九月在中国医大总校举行了一次两种教育制度下的学生的比较考试。应试的是在长春、沈阳医学院等旧型正规医科教育制度下学习了六七年的毕业生和肄业学生与在中国医大专科重点制度下学习一年就毕业的外科学生。结果中国医大学生基础课平均考八十三点七分，后期临床课平均考八十二点一分；而那些学了六七年的医科大学学生基础课平均考三十一分，后期临床课平均考二十四分。
    这一次比较考试，完全证明了两种制度的优劣。现在中国医大的学习时间延长为五年，新制度的优点就更能表现出来了。
    关内许多医科学校如二野医科大学、华中医学院、华北医科大学等已经采用了这些新办法，北大医学院、昆明医学院、贵阳医学院、西南大学等也准备实行；华东方面则派了两个参观团到东北参观，准备回去研究开始实行。今年参加全国卫生科学研究工作者会议的医学卫生方面的专家、学者二十多人，也组成了代表团前往东北参观，纷纷发表赞扬的意见。例如黄坚白先生说：“专科教育能提高“质”而不仅解决“量”的问题，我们此番来东北实地考察，已充分予以证明。但仍有少数人怀疑这些方法，以为这仅是为“量”而不是为“质”，不合乎正规医学标准；可见马列主义和毛泽东思想在旧医学教育界尚未完全生根发芽，这是值得我们深切检讨的。”
