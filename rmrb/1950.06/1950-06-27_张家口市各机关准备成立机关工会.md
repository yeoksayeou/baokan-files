　　Zhangjiakou City Agencies Prepare to Establish Agency Trade Unions
    The Zhangjiakou City Federation of Trade Unions convened a symposium of representatives from various agencies on the 15th of this month. After research and discussion, it was decided that the tasks of the city's agency trade unions are: (1) to organize professional studies to improve work efficiency; (2) to assist the administration in improving operations and to carry out award and evaluation work; and (3) to handle matters related to employee welfare, recreation, and life. The meeting decided to establish a preparatory committee in July, to formally establish trade unions in each agency in August, and to formally establish the City Agency Trade Union Committee in September.
