　　"May Day"
    —Diary of a Visit to the Soviet Union, Part Two
    Zhao Guoyou
    On April 30th, we stayed up until after 2:00 AM preparing for the "May Day" celebrations. Although we only slept for a few hours, we got up promptly at 6:30 the next morning, waiting to participate in the "May Day" grand ceremony. At 8:30, we lined up and headed towards Red Square. As we approached the podium, two comrades, a man and a woman, took pictures of our delegation with cameras. We found our places, our eyes simply couldn't keep up: over 300 musicians in a large band, the Navy, Army, and Air Force, mechanized troops, and paratroopers, marched in formation towards Red Square. At 10:00, the band began to play in unison. Soon after, the inspection began. First, the eighty rows of Navy, Army, and Air Force marched forward. At this moment, countless movie cameras were filming from upstairs and downstairs. From this neat and majestic procession, the power of the Soviet socialist state and the world's forces for peace were fully demonstrated. In the parade, there were weapons we had never seen before and couldn't even name. Some tanks were equipped with mountain guns and anti-aircraft guns. The mechanized troops rode electric donkeys (motorcycles) and sat in cars, marching as orderly as people in a line. In the air were airplanes, first four-engine large fighters, flying in formation over Red Square. The most exciting were the supersonic planes. These planes were faster than the speed of sound, and you could only hear the sound after they had passed. Their shape was like a small swallow, with wings curved backward. While we were looking up and down, we suddenly heard that Marshal Stalin had arrived. At this moment, everyone in the audience, regardless of everything else, crowded and jumped, stretching their necks and raising their feet to see, ready to shake hands. The cheers continued for a long time. We were anxious because we couldn't get close enough to shake hands and talk. Old Wang grabbed Old Chen's glasses and combined them with his own to use as binoculars. Looking through the binoculars, we saw Stalin, robust and strong, with a ruddy face and a smile. After an hour, the troops finished passing, and a large group of small children in white uniforms walked by, this was the children's team. Behind them followed students, ordinary people, and a large procession that stretched as far as the eye could see. The procession carried all kinds of flags and models of lathes, trains, and other equipment, as well as portraits of leaders of various New Democratic countries, including large portraits of our Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and Comrade Liu Shaoqi. The procession constantly shouted slogans. When the procession reached the front of the Chinese delegation, they waved flags, held up flowers, clapped their hands, and shouted slogans such as "Long Live Mao Zedong." Many people left the procession to wave at us. Children also rode on their fathers' heads to greet us. We stood there waving all the time: our right hand hurt from waving, so we waved with our left. While we were rejoicing and cheering, a female comrade ran over with a movie camera to take pictures of us. In this way, we stared with our eyes wide open as the large procession of about three million people passed by, for a total of seven and a half hours. Back at the hotel, I thought to myself that the Soviet people's love for us is beyond description. Even five-year-old Soviet children know how to shout "Long Live Mao Zedong," which truly demonstrates the internationalist spirit of the Soviet people and the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. My participation in this "May Day" rally has given me immense strength. I will work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

　　“五一节”
    —访苏日记之二
    赵国有
    四月三十号，为了准备庆祝“五一”，我们到晚上两点多钟方才睡觉。虽然只睡了几个钟头，但是第二天早上六时三十分我们又准时起来，等着参加“五一”盛典。八时三十分，我们排着队往红场进发。快到主席台的时候，有两个男女同志拿着照像机对着我们代表团照像。我们找到位置，眼睛简直忙不过来：三百多名大乐队，海、陆、空军、机械化部队、降落伞部队，排成方块形向红场走来。到十点钟，乐队一齐奏乐。不久就开始检阅。首先是海陆空军八十行的队伍往前行进。这时候，无数电影机在楼上楼下开拍。从这整齐雄壮的队伍中，充分表现出苏联社会主义国家及世界和平力量的强大。在游行的队伍中，有着我们从来未见过也叫不出名字的武器。有的坦克车上装置着山炮和高射炮。机械化部队，都骑着电驴子（摩托车）和坐着汽车，走起来像人排队一样整齐。空中是飞机，首先是四个发动机的大战斗机，排着队由红场上面穿过。最令人兴奋的是超音机。这种飞机的速度比声音还快，飞过去方能听到声音。它的形状就像小燕子，翅膀往后边弯着。我们正在上下看的时候，忽然听说斯大林大元帅来啦。这时全场的人不顾一切，拥挤跳动，伸长脖子，抬起脚看，准备握手的样子。欢呼声很久不断。这时我们凑不到跟前握手说话，很着急。老王把老陈的眼镜抢过来和他的眼镜合在一起当望远镜使用。我们用望远镜一看，斯大林身魁力壮，脸面红润，露着笑容。经过一点钟的光景，军队过完，白哇哇的小个子队形走过来，这是少年儿童队。后边跟着的是学生，百姓等一眼望不到头的大队伍。队伍里打着各种各样的旗子和车床子、火车等各种模型，还有各新民主主义国家的领袖像，其中有咱们毛主席、周总理、刘少奇同志三个人的大像。大队不断的高呼口号。当队伍走到中国代表团前面时，他们就摇起旗子、举起花、拍手，高呼着“毛泽东万岁”等口号。有很多人离开队伍，给我们招手。小孩子也骑在他爹爹头上向我们招呼。我们站在那里也一直挥手：右手挥痛啦，再挥左手。我们正在欢腾鼓舞时，又跑来一个女同志拿着电影机向我们拍照。就这样，我们一直瞪着眼睛看三百万人左右的大队伍过完，时间整七个半钟头。回到旅馆我一想，觉得苏联人民对我们的热爱是难以形容的。苏联五岁的小孩都知道喊“毛泽东万岁”，这真是表现苏联人民的国际主义精神，也表现中苏两国人民深厚的友谊。我参加了这个“五一”大会，使我增加了无比的力量。我要努力学习苏联的先进经验。
