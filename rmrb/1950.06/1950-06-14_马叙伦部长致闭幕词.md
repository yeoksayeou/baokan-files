　　Minister Ma Xulun's Closing Remarks
    [Xinhua News Agency News] Minister of Education Ma Xulun of the Central People's Government delivered the full text of his closing speech to the First National Higher Education Conference on June 9th:
    Fellow Representatives, Fellow Comrades:
    The First National Higher Education Conference, which began on the 30th of last month, after two days of preparatory meetings and nine days of formal meetings, is today, according to the planned schedule, victoriously concluding.
    In this conference, based on the Common Program, we discussed the principles, tasks, and several important issues of higher education in the new China, extensively exchanged and concentrated opinions from all sides, highly demonstrated the spirit of consultation, and finally reached a consensus on several important issues related to higher education, giving our future higher education a clear direction. This direction is that we should strive to cultivate high-level national construction talents with a high cultural level, who have mastered modern science and technology achievements, and who wholeheartedly serve the people, using an educational method that combines theory and practice. We should prepare and begin to admit worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant youth into our universities to cultivate a new type of intellectual from worker-peasant backgrounds. In implementing this policy, we must strive to overcome the dogmatic tendency of being divorced from reality, which is the main direction of effort for our colleagues engaged in higher education today; at the same time, we must also prevent the narrow utilitarianism or empiricism that belittles theoretical learning. We have clearly and firmly established this direction, which is the greatest and most historically significant achievement of this conference. I hope that all higher education workers can move forward firmly according to this policy.
    Secondly, in this conference, we highly demonstrated the spirit of democratic consultation for the benefit of the country and the people, which is very valuable. We are not afraid of having different views and opinions on various issues of national construction; we are only afraid of having opinions but not expressing them openly, so that correct opinions cannot be adopted and promoted, and incorrect opinions cannot be revised and improved, which would cause losses to our country and people. But our conference was not like that at all. Many of our comrades had various different opinions before and during the conference. For example, there were sharp debates in the pre-conference curriculum reform discussions. In the general discussion of principles, tasks, curriculum, and regulations, there were also heated debates. Various different opinions and methods were also published in the newspapers. This is a very good phenomenon. It fully promotes the spirit of New Democracy and demonstrates a new academic atmosphere of free discussion and the pursuit of truth. At the same time, everyone abided by the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and with an attitude of responsibility to the people, expressed various different opinions. After debate, problems were solved in a pragmatic way. If a complete consensus can be reached now, a conclusion will be made and implemented. As for those that cannot reach a consensus for a while, or whose subjective and objective conditions are not yet mature, no conclusion will be made for the time being, and everyone will continue to study. Comrades! We should promote this spirit well and apply it correctly to all our future work. Based on this spirit, we can consolidate our unity, and as long as we have consolidated unity, all future difficulties can be overcome.
    Thirdly, I would like to say a few more words about the construction of new higher education and the transformation of old higher education. I remember that in the National Education Work Conference, I said about building new education and transforming old education: "The new education we are to implement is completely opposite in nature to the old education," "We must fundamentally reform the old education." I believe that it is very necessary for every educator to clearly recognize the essential differences between this new and old education, because the new and old education are reflections of two different social economies. The difference between them is the difference between the nature of semi-feudal and semi-colonial education and the nature of new democratic education, and there can be no ambiguity. My remarks naturally include the old higher education. In the education of old China, it could not but be "a reflection of the old political economy and a tool by which the old political economy continued." This nature cannot but be reflected in a series of issues such as the principles, tasks, educational content, and methods of education at all levels. We must resolutely negate the nature and basic spirit of the old education. The content, system, and methods of the old education must be reformed. These should be affirmed, and there should be no doubt. However, this reform must be carried out step by step and cautiously according to the provisions of Article 46 of the Common Program. It is wrong to delay reform unwillingly, and it is also wrong to attempt to use crude methods and be eager for quick success. At the same time, New Democratic education is a new educational system. It is a tool that reflects the new political economy and consolidates and develops the people's democratic dictatorship. This is a new system. In this system, we must absorb as much as possible all the rational components of the old education that are beneficial to the people, and we are not allowed to ignore or reject them. This point must also be affirmed.
    In this conference, in addition to pointing out the need to prevent narrow utilitarianism or empiricism, we unanimously criticized the divorce from reality of the old higher education. We put forward the principle of the unity of theory and practice. The new higher education must be combined with the actual needs of national construction and serve national construction; it opposes empty dogmatism for the sake of "scholarship for scholarship's sake" and opposes all forms of ideas divorced from reality. But it must be recognized that implementing the principle of the unity of theory and practice in education is still a rather long process of struggle and cannot be completely resolved by one conference. We must carry out a lot of ideological preparation and preparation of certain material conditions. First of all, according to the Common Program, we must affirm that the entire purpose of higher education today is to strengthen and consolidate the construction of New Democracy, and there can be no other so-called higher purpose. Therefore, we must implement close cooperation between higher education institutions and various departments of national construction, and implement close integration of lectures and internships, experiments, and visits, in order to gradually realize the unity of theory and practice. Comrades! This is an important key in the construction of new higher education. We believe that after this conference, everyone will be more confident in establishing the new style of study, that is, the style of study of "seeking truth from facts" advocated by Chairman Mao Zedong, and raising the higher education of the new China a step further.
    In addition to solving the direction of higher education, this conference also made practical solutions to many important issues, such as curriculum reform, organizational regulations, leadership issues, compiling teaching materials, etc. A total of 210 proposals from various places were also discussed in various groups and will be handed over to the Central Ministry of Education for separate processing. The reason why we have been able to achieve such achievements in a short period of eleven days is due to the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the kind concern and direct instructions of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou for this conference. It is due to the timely guidance of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, the attending representatives from various regions, the representatives from relevant departments of the Central Government, the experts and guests, and the hard work of all the comrades of the Ministry who participated in the conference. I feel very excited and happy, and I would like to express my heartfelt thanks here.
    Under the banner of Chairman Mao Zedong, let us intensify our efforts to build higher education for New Democracy. The future of our cause is infinitely bright.

　　马叙伦部长致闭幕词
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府教育部马叙伦部长于六月九日向第一次全国高等教育会议的闭幕词全文如下：各位代表、各位同志：
    第一次全国高等教育会议，从上月三十日开始，经过两天的预备会，九天的正式会议，今天是按照预定的日程，胜利地闭幕了。
    在这次会议中，我们根据共同纲领，讨论了新中国的高等教育的方针、任务和若干重要问题，广泛地交换和集中了各方面的意见，高度地发挥了协商的精神，最后在有关高等教育的几个重要问题上都达到了一致的意见，使我们今后的高等教育有了一个明确的方向。这个方向就是我们应该以理论与实际一致的教育方法，为培养具有高度文化水平的、掌握现代科学和技术的成就的、全心全意为人民服务的、高级的国家建设人才而努力，应该准备和开始吸收工农干部和工农青年进我们的高等学校，以培养工农出身的新型知识分子。在执行这个方针时，我们要努力克服脱离实际的教条主义偏向，这是今天我们从事高等教育的同人的主要努力方向；而同时也要防止轻视理论学习的狭隘实用主义或经验主义的偏向。我们把这个方向明确和坚定地确定下来，这是这次大会最大的和具有历史意义的收获。我希望全体高等教育工作者都能根据这个方针，坚定不移地向前迈进。
    其次，在这次会议中，我们为了国家与人民的利益，高度发挥了民主协商的精神，这是十分可贵的。我们对于国家建设的各项问题不怕有不同的看法和不同的意见，我们只怕有了意见，却不公开地说出来，使正确的意见得不到采用和发扬的机会，使不正确的意见得不到修正和改进的机会，这样就会使我们的国家和人民受到损失。而我们的这次会议却完全不是那样。我们的许多同志在会前和会议进行中是存在着各种不同的意见的。例如在会前的课改讨论中有尖锐的争论，在大会讨论方针、任务、课程、规章中，同样有热烈的争论，在报纸上，也发表了各种不同的意见和办法。这就是很好的现象。它充分地发扬了新民主主义的精神，表现了自由讨论、追求真理的新的学术风气。同时大家又遵守了人民政协共同纲领，抱着对人民负责的态度，把各种不同的意见讲出来，经过争论，实事求是地解决问题，如现在就能够达到完全一致的，就作出结论来实行，至于一时还不能在取得一致或主观客观条件还不成熟的，就暂时不作出结论，大家再继续研究。同志们！这种精神我们应该好好地发扬，正确地运用到今后的一切工作中去。以这种精神为基础，我们就能巩固我们的团结，而只要我们有了巩固的团结，那么今后的一切困难就都可以克服了。
    再次，关于新的高等教育的建设和旧的高等教育的改造这一问题，我还要说几句话。我记得，我在全国教育工作会议中，对于建设新教育和改造旧教育曾经说过：“我们要实施的这种新教育和旧教育是性质上完全相反的东西”，“我们对旧教育不能不作根本的改革。”我认为对于每个教育工作者，明确地认识这种新旧教育在本质上的区别是十分必要的，因为新教育与旧教育乃是两种不同社会经济的反映，它们之间的区别乃是半封建半殖民地教育的性质和新民主主义教育性质的区别，是不能有一点含混的。我这段话自然也包含旧日的高等教育在内，在旧中国的教育，不能不是“旧政治经济的一种反映和旧政治经济借以持续的一种工具”。这一性质不能不体现在各级教育的方针、任务、教育内容和方法等一系列的问题上。我们对旧教育的性质和基本精神，是决然应该否定的。对旧教育的内容、制度和方法，是必须改革的。这些都应该加以肯定，不能有任何怀疑的。但这种改革必须根据共同纲领第四十六条的规定，应该有步骤地谨慎地前进，拖延时间不愿改革是不对的，企图用粗暴的方法，急于求成也是不对的。同时，新民主主义教育是一种新的教育体系，它是作为反映新政治经济，巩固与发展人民民主专政的一种工具，这是一个新的体系，在这一体系中我们要尽可能地吸收旧教育中一切对人民有利的合理成份，而不允许加以忽视或拒绝。这一点我们也是要肯定的。
    在这次会议中，我们除了提出要防止狭隘的实用主义或经验主义以外，对于旧的高等教育的脱离实际我们大家一致地作了批评了。我们提出了理论和实际一致的原则。新的高等教育必须和国家建设的实际相结合，为国家建设服务；反对了为“学术而学术”的空洞的教条主义，反对了各种形态的脱离实际的思想。但要认识，教育要贯彻理论和实际一致的原则，仍然是一个相当长的奋斗过程，不是一个会议所能完全解决的。我们必须进行许多思想的准备工作和一定的物质条件的准备。首先我们要根据共同纲领，肯定今天高等教育的全部目的，就是加强和巩固新民主主义的建设，此外不能有其他所谓更高尚的目的。因此我们必须实行高等教育机关和国家建设各部门的密切配合，实行讲授和实习、实验参观等的密切结合，以达到逐渐实现理论与实际一致的目的。同志们！这是新的高等教育建设中一个重要关键。我们相信，经过了这次会议，大家一定会更有信心地将新的学风，即毛泽东主席所倡导的“实事求是”的学风建立起来，将新中国的高等教育提高一步。
    这次会议除解决了高等教育的方向以外，对于很多重要问题，如课程改革、组织规程、领导问题、编译教材等等，也都作了符合于实际的解决，各地带来的提案一共有二一○件，也都分别在各小组讨论了，并将交中央教育部分别处理。在短短的十一天中我们之所以能有如此的成就，乃是由于毛泽东思想的光辉指导与毛主席和周总理对这次会议的亲切关怀和直接指示，是由于有政务院文化教育委员会的及时指导、各地区出席代表、中央有关各部门代表、各位专家和来宾以及本部参加大会工作的全体同志们紧张工作的结果。我一面感到非常的兴奋和愉快，一面在此表示衷心的感谢。
    在毛泽东主席的旗帜下，我们为建设新民主主义的高等教育而加紧努力吧。我们事业的前途是无限光明的。
