U.S. Aggression Against Our Country's Territory, Taiwan Province—A Consistent Crime
	Yu Gan
	In a statement issued on June 27th, U.S. President Truman brazenly announced that the United States would occupy the territory of the People's Republic of China—Taiwan Province. Truman claimed that the Chinese People's Liberation Army's liberation of its own national territory—Taiwan Province—"would directly threaten the security of the Pacific region and the U.S. forces performing legitimate (!) and necessary duties in the region." Truman then announced that he had ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet to "prevent any attack on Taiwan." In the statement, Truman implied that the ultimate goal of the U.S. government's action was to change the "status" of Taiwan Province, that is, to turn Taiwan into a colony of U.S. imperialism. He said: "The determination of the future status of Taiwan must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations." Truman's statement is the result of the consistent policy of U.S. imperialism to invade our Taiwan. Truman, with his own hands, completely tore off the mask of the so-called U.S. government that it would not invade Taiwan and other Chinese territories.
	In a statement issued on January 5th of this year, Truman could not but admit the universally known fact that Taiwan is Chinese territory. In that statement, Truman said: "In the Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and the Chairman of China stated that their purpose was that territories Japan had stolen from China, such as Taiwan, should be returned to China. The United States is a signatory to the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945. The Potsdam Declaration stated that the terms of the Cairo Declaration should be implemented. Japan also accepted the provisions of this declaration upon surrender. In order to implement the above declarations, Taiwan was handed over to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. For the past four years, the United States and other allies have also recognized that China has the right to exercise power over the island." In this statement, Truman hypocritically concealed the truth that the United States was interfering in China's internal affairs and actively attempting to seize Taiwan. He said: "The United States has never had predatory ambitions for Taiwan or other Chinese territories. The United States has no intention of obtaining special rights or privileges or establishing military bases in Taiwan. The United States does not intend to use armed forces to interfere in its current situation, and the United States government does not intend to follow any path that would involve the United States in China's internal strife. Similarly, the United States government does not intend to provide military assistance or advice to the Chinese troops in Taiwan."
	After Truman's statement was issued, the U.S. Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy pointed out in a statement issued on January 9th: "Like previous U.S. government statements of non-interference in China, this statement is to cover up actual interference." The committee pointed out that Truman's statement and the rantings of another faction in the United States advocating sending troops to invade Taiwan "are in fact just a division of labor among those who have the same goal."
	It is well known that the U.S. government interferes in China's internal affairs. It has aided the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group with billions of dollars in war materials to slaughter the Chinese people. The U.S. government's coveting of our Taiwan and other territories is also an open secret. From the time of Japan's surrender, the U.S. government has secretly supported the so-called "Taiwan independence" movement, plotting to separate Taiwan from our other territories and turn it into a colony of U.S. imperialism. Just two days before Truman issued his so-called non-interference statement, the reactionary U.S. columnist Pearson, known for his inside information in Washington, revealed in the Washington Post that the White House had held a meeting the week before he wrote the article to discuss the "Far East crisis," "President Truman presided over this meeting and, like the military leaders, was eager to do something about the strategic island of Taiwan." Pearson further revealed that Truman and his advisors had agreed to ship rifles, ammunition, artillery, howitzers, and other equipment to the Kuomintang remnants. The cost of transporting the military supplies would be allocated from the $75 million approved by the last congressional session (Reuters, New York, January 3rd). Acheson immediately explained on the same day that Truman issued the statement that "the Chinese Nationalists in Taiwan can still legally purchase American weapons" and emphasized that Truman's statement was only "temporarily" not intending to establish bases in Taiwan.
	Before Truman issued his statement, the U.S. government had already signed a criminal secret agreement with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. This agreement stipulated that the United States would supply the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang with sixteen warships, weapons and equipment for five divisions, radar equipment for the entire province of Taiwan, and aircraft parts and repair equipment; the United States would continue to allocate more than $90 million in remaining aid funds, and would hand over the $75 million appropriation passed by the U.S. Congress for general areas in China to the Taiwan remnants for use. The conditions undertaken by the bandit side were: (1) Reorganize the Taiwan remnant "government," with Wu Guozhen and Sun Liren, the trusted running dogs of U.S. imperialism, in charge of Taiwan's political and military affairs respectively; (2) The U.S. government would send a military delegation to Taiwan, and the delegation would send various advisors to control various institutions of the remnant "government" and take charge of all military, political, and economic affairs in Taiwan.
	Since then, the U.S. government has consistently implemented the above-mentioned secret agreement to help the Taiwan Kuomintang traitorous bandit gang continue to carry out the civil war and turn Taiwan into a de facto colony of the United States. A large number of American weapons, ammunition, materials, and American and Japanese personnel arrived in Taiwan from the United States, Canada, the Philippines, and Japan. According to sporadic news reports from various sources, hundreds of tanks and trucks have been transported to Taiwan. The cost of each of these tanks is $58,000, but they are sold to the Kuomintang remnants for $1,000. In mid-March, American ships transported another batch of military aircraft auxiliary gasoline tanks to Taiwan. In addition, the United States transported non-ferrous metals worth $200,000 from Japan to Taiwan.
	In mid-May of this year, a group of American aggressors, under the guise of "consultants" and "experts" from the "New York China International Business Corporation," carried out aggressive activities in Taiwan. These included former U.S. Navy Admiral Kirk (Kirk arrived in Taiwan in February of this year) and Marine Corps Brigadier General Pan Fo. The work of these aggressors was to "ensure that Taiwan's existing materials are used to the fullest extent as soon as possible, and to thoroughly investigate the types and quantities of urgently needed materials, and to find ways to replenish them in the near future" (Kuomintang Central News Agency, Hong Kong, May 20th). The "China International Business Corporation" is the executive agency of the U.S. aid-Chiang and aggression-China policy under the approval of the U.S. State Department.
	The above series of facts fully proves that the U.S. government has been implementing a policy of aggression against our country's territory, Taiwan Province. The purpose of Truman's statement on January 5th, as revealed by a United Press Washington dispatch on January 10th, was first to "establish an 'unassailable' position for the United States as a defender of the democratic ideal who has no ambition for any country in Asia and no intention of interfering in Asia's internal affairs," and second, to attempt to provoke the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, that is, to "ultimately alienate the CCP government from Moscow." But Truman's above-mentioned attempts have been exposed and shattered by the Chinese people. Faced with the victory of the Chinese people and the Asian people, all of the planned plans of U.S. imperialism have failed and its robber face has been exposed day by day.
	As early as February of this year, at the Bangkok Conference held by U.S. government Far East diplomatic personnel, measures to obstruct the Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan became the primary topic of the meeting. Before the meeting, Jessup, the maker of U.S. Far East policy who presided over the meeting, went to Tokyo to meet with MacArthur. He said at a press conference: "The United States does not intend to abandon China." Around the Bangkok Conference, the four chiefs of staff of the United States toured the Far East. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley met with MacArthur in Tokyo and openly advocated "taking concrete measures" to maintain Taiwan, which has "strategic value." On June 5th, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Radford revealed at a press conference that he was interested in reports in the newspaper that Secretary of Defense Johnson was working hard to draft a plan to "neutralize Taiwan" in the event of an attack by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In mid-June, U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, and U.S. Secretary of State Special Advisor Dulles traveled to Tokyo to meet with MacArthur. Before the three of them set off for Japan, Agence France-Presse Washington, June 16th, revealed the news from so-called well-informed sources that Taiwan might be included in the U.S. Far East "defense system" (i.e., aggression system). The telegram also revealed: "The State Department, which 'opposed' the idea of defending Taiwan a month ago, has partially agreed to General MacArthur's proposal." Bradley, Johnson, and others returned to the United States after holding multiple secret consultations with MacArthur. The result of their consultation on the Taiwan issue was Truman's statement on June 27th.
	Therefore, Truman's statement has not substantially changed the existing situation in Taiwan. It has only made public what was originally more hidden. The Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan has always included the possible interference of U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people will continue to prepare everything to liberate Taiwan.

　　美国侵略我国领土台湾省的一贯罪行
    于干
    美国总统杜鲁门于六月二十七日发表的声明中，公然宣布美国将侵占中华人民共和国的领土——台湾省。杜鲁门宣称：中国人民解放军解放自己国家的领土——台湾省，“将直接威胁太平洋地区的安全，及在该地区执行合法（！）而必要的职务的美国部队”。杜鲁门接着宣布他已命令美国第七舰队“阻止对台湾的任何攻击”。杜鲁门在声明中暗示美国政府此举的最终目的是改变台湾省的“地位”，即把台湾变成美国帝国主义的殖民地。他说：“台湾未来地位的决定，必须等待太平洋安全的恢复，对日和约的缔结，或联合国的考虑。”杜鲁门的这个声明，是美国帝国主义侵略我国台湾的一贯政策的结果。杜鲁门用自己的手，完全地撕毁了所谓美国政府将不侵略台湾及其他中国领土的假面具。
    杜鲁门在今年一月五日发表的声明中曾经不能不承认台湾是中国的领土这个举世周知的事实。杜鲁门在那个声明中说：“在一九四三年十二月一日的开罗宣言中，美国总统、英国首相及中国主席曾申明他们的目的是：日本自中国夺去的领土如台湾应当归还中国。美国是一九四五年七月二十六日波茨坦宣言的签字国。波茨坦宣言称，开罗宣言的条款应予执行。日本于投降时亦曾接受此宣言的规定。为实践以上各项宣言台湾即交给蒋介石委员长。过去四年来美国及其他盟国亦承认中国得对该岛行使权力。”杜鲁门在这个声明中虚伪地掩盖美国正在干涉中国内政和积极企图夺去台湾的真相。他说：“美国对台湾或中国其他领土从无掠夺野心。现在美国亦无意在台湾获取特别权益或特权或建立军事基地。美国亦不拟使用武装部队干预其现在的局势，美国政府不拟遵循任何足以把美国卷入中国内争中的途径。同样地美国政府也不拟对在台湾的中国军队供给军事援助或咨询。”
    杜鲁门这一声明发表后，美国民主远东政策委员会于一月九日发表的声明中曾指出：“像美国政府历次不干涉中国的声明一样，这个声明是为了掩盖实际上的干涉。”该委员会指出：杜鲁门的声明与美国另外一派主张出兵侵占台湾的狂妄分子，“事实上只是那些怀有同一目的的人中间的一种分工”。
    美国政府干涉中国内政是尽人皆知的。它曾以数十亿美元战争物资援助蒋介石反动集团屠杀中国人民。美国政府垂涎我国台湾及其他领土也是公开的秘密。从日本投降的时候起，美国政府就偷偷摸摸地支持所谓“台湾独立”运动，阴谋使台湾和我国其他领土分割开来，变为美帝国主义的殖民地。就在杜鲁门发表所谓不干涉的声明的前两天，以熟悉华盛顿内幕消息著名的美国的反动的专栏作家皮尔逊在华盛顿邮报上透露：在他写文章的前一周，白宫曾召开了一个讨论“远东危机”的会议，“杜鲁门总统主持这一会议，并且和军事领袖们一样急于对台湾这个战略岛屿有所作为”。皮尔逊进一步透露，杜鲁门及其顾问已同意把步枪、弹药、大炮、榴弹炮及其他装备运给国民党残匪。输运军火的费用由上次国会会议所批准的七千五百万元中拨出（路透社纽约一月三日电）。艾奇逊在杜鲁门发表声明的同日就立即解释说：“台湾的中国国民党仍能依法购买美国武器”，并强调说杜鲁门的声明只是“暂时”无意在台湾建立基地。
    在杜鲁门发表声明以前，美国政府即已与蒋介石匪帮签订一项罪恶的秘密协议。这项协议规定：美国供给蒋介石匪帮十六艘军舰，五个师的武器装备，台湾全省的雷达设备及飞机零件和修理设备等；美国继续拨付九千多万美元的援匪剩余款项，并将美国国会通过的所谓用于中国一般地区的七千五百万美元的拨款完全交给台湾残匪使用。匪方担任的条件是：（一）改组台湾残匪“政府”，由美帝国主义的宠信走狗吴国桢、孙立人分别掌管台湾的政治和军事；（二）美国政府派遣军事代表团驻台，该代表团派遣各种顾问控制残匪“政府”的各种机构，掌管台湾的全部军政和经济。
    美国政府从那时起即一贯地执行上述帮助台湾国民党卖国贼匪帮继续进行内战，并将台湾变为美国的实际殖民地的秘密协议。大批的美国武器、弹药、物资和美国及日本的人员由美国、加拿大、菲律宾、日本源源到达台湾。据各方报道的零星消息统计，先后运往台湾的坦克和卡车即有数百辆。这些坦克的造价每辆为五万八千美元，而卖给国民党残匪的价格则是一千美元。三月中，美轮又装运一批军用飞机补助汽油箱前往台湾。另外美国并由日本运送价值二十万美元的有色金属前往台湾。
    今年五月中，一批美国侵略分子又以“纽约中国国际商业公司”的“顾问”和“专家”名义在台湾进行侵略活动。其中包括前美国海军上将柯克（按柯克系于今年二月间抵台湾）和海军陆战队准将潘佛。这些侵略分子的工作是“一面使台湾现有物资及早充分发挥最高作用，一面彻底调查急需的物资种类和数量，设法在最近期内获得补充”（国民党中央社香港五月二十日电）。而“中国国际商业公司”就是在美国国务院裁可之下美国援蒋侵华政策的执行机关。
    上面这一系列的事实，充分证明美国政府一直在执行侵略我国领土台湾省的政策。而杜鲁门一月五日声明的目的正如合众社华盛顿一月十日电所透露的，第一是“为美国建立一个对亚洲任何国家均无野心且无干涉亚洲内政意图的民主理想的保卫者的‘不可攻击的’地位”，第二是妄图挑拨中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，即所谓“最后把中共政府与莫斯科离间开”。但杜鲁门的上述企图已为中国人民所揭穿和粉碎。面对着中国人民与亚洲人民的胜利，美帝国主义的一切预定计划都落了空，一天天暴露了它的强盗面目。
    还在今年二月间，美国政府远东外交人员举行的曼谷会议中，阻挠中国人民解放军解放台湾的措施就成为会议的首要议题。在会议以前，主持该会议的美国远东政策的制定者耶塞普曾往东京与麦克阿瑟会商，他在记者招待会上说：“美国不拟放弃中国”。在曼谷会议前后，美国的四个参谋长巡视远东。参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷曾在东京与麦克阿瑟会谈，公然主张“采取具体措施”，以保持具有“战略价值”的台湾。六月五日，美国太平洋舰队司令雷德福在记者招待会上透露，他对报纸消息所传国防部长詹逊正在竭力拟订一个一旦中国人民解放军进攻时“使台湾中立”的计划感到兴趣。六月中旬，美国防部长詹逊、参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷、美国国务卿特别顾问杜勒斯三人分途前往东京与麦克阿瑟会商。在他们三人还未动身赴日前，法新社华盛顿十六日电透露了所谓消息灵通人士的消息说：台湾可能被包括在美国的远东“防御体系”（按即侵略体系）之中。该电还透露：“一个月以前还‘反对’保卫台湾的主意的国务院已经部分地同意了麦克阿瑟将军提出的建议。”布莱德雷、詹逊等在与麦克阿瑟秘密会商多次后返回美国。他们对台湾问题会商的结果，就是杜鲁门六月二十七日的声明。
    因此，杜鲁门声明实质上并没有对于台湾的现存情势造成大的改变，它不过是把原来较为隐蔽的东西加以公开而已。我国人民解放台湾的决心从来就是把美帝国主义的可能干涉计算在内的。我国人民将继续准备一切以求台湾的解放。
