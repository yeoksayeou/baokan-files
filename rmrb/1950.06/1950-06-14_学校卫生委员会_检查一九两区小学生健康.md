　　School Health Committee
    Inspects the Health of Primary School Students in Districts One and Nine
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to preliminarily understand the physical development and health conditions of general primary school students in the city, the Municipal School Health Committee specifically selected students from municipal and private primary schools within the boundaries of District One, where environmental conditions are relatively good, and District Nine, where environmental conditions are relatively poor, for physical examinations. In District One, 6,606 students from municipal primary schools and 1,287 students from private primary schools were examined. In District Nine, 2,487 students from municipal primary schools were examined. The results of the examination showed that in District One, 2,252 municipal primary school students had no defects (healthy), accounting for 34.1 percent of the number examined; 633 private primary school students had no defects, accounting for 49.2 percent of the number examined. 4,354 municipal primary school students had defects (unhealthy), accounting for 65.9 percent of the number examined, and 654 private primary school students had defects, accounting for 50.6 percent of the number examined. In District Nine, 458 students had no defects, accounting for 18.4 percent of the number examined, and 2,029 students had defects, accounting for 81.6 percent of the number examined. Generally, the number of defects was higher in District Nine than in District One. This illustrates that there is a close relationship between the health conditions of students in the two districts and their living environment.
