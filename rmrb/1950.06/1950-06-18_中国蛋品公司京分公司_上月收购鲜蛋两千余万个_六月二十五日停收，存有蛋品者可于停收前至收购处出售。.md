    China Egg Products Company Beijing Branch
    Acquired Over 20 Million Fresh Eggs Last Month
    Collection to Cease on June 25th. Those with Egg Products in Storage Can Sell Them to the Acquisition Point Before the Suspension.
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Beijing Branch of the China Egg Products Company acquired over 26 million fresh eggs in May. Due to seasonal factors, the company plans to suspend acquisitions starting from the 25th of this month. Since its establishment in November last year, the company has been engaged in the acquisition, allocation, and processing of fresh eggs, and has achieved certain successes. The company originally planned to acquire 25.5 million fresh eggs in May, but the actual acquisition reached 26,700,080, exceeding the plan by 4.74 percent. Among them, acquisitions through cooperatives accounted for 80.6 percent of the total, while those acquired through private merchants accounted for 19.4 percent.
    The consumption of fresh eggs in Beijing is very high, with nearly 200,000 fresh eggs entering the market every day, of which about 70 percent are consumed by government agencies, hospitals, schools, and the general public. The company's acquisitions account for only about 30 percent of the market supply. Therefore, in addition to conducting acquisitions in the Beijing market, the company also has acquisition teams in the Baoding, Tongxian, and Tangshan areas, with points under these teams. The company has working points in Zhuoxian, Xushui, Tangxian, Changli, Qinhuangdao, and other places. Among the acquisitions in May, the Baoding area accounted for the most, at 41.5 percent, while Beijing accounted for the least, at only 5.7 percent.
    Now that the weather is getting warmer and egg production is also decreasing, the company plans to suspend acquisitions before the 25th of this month. Farmers or egg vendors with stocks can sell them to the company's acquisition points before the suspension period.

　　中国蛋品公司京分公司
    上月收购鲜蛋两千余万个   
    六月二十五日停收，存有蛋品者可于停收前至收购处出售。
    【本报讯】中国蛋品公司北京分公司，五月份收购鲜蛋两千六百余万个；因季节关系，拟自本月二十五日起暂停收购。该公司自去年十一月成立以来，即开展鲜蛋收购、调配、加工业务，且获得一定成绩。该公司原定五月份计划收购鲜蛋二千五百五十万个，实际收购共二千六百七十万零八千余个，超过计划百分之四·七四。其中通过合作社收购的占总额的百分之八○·六，通过私商收进的占百分之一九·四。
    北京市鲜蛋消费量很大，每天上市将近二十万的鲜蛋，约有百分之七十左右为机关、医院、学校及一般市民所食用。公司收购的不过占上市量百分之三十左右。因此该公司除在京市场进行收购外，另在保定、通县、唐山三地区设有收购组，组下设点，涿县、徐水、唐县、昌黎、秦皇岛等地均有该公司工作点。五月份中以保定区收购最多，占百分之四一·五，京市最少，仅占百分之五·七。
    现因天气渐热，蛋产亦将减少，该公司拟于本月二十五日以前暂停收购。农民或蛋贩有存货者，可在停收期前向公司收购处所出售。
