　　A New Atmosphere in Shouyang After Land Reform
　　Farmers are actively building houses, purchasing agricultural tools and livestock, reclaiming wasteland, and ensuring the completion of increased production plans.
　　[Our Newspaper Shouyang News] After the land reform movement in Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, the countryside has shown a new atmosphere of production and prosperity. Shouyang County has a total of one hundred and ninety-nine administrative villages, and land reform work began in 1948. Among them, fifty-one administrative villages in the old liberated areas and eighty-nine administrative villages in the new liberated areas have successively completed land reform; in the remaining villages, only some residual problems remain to be solved. After the land certificates were issued in the villages that had completed land reform, the farmers generally reflected: "Land rights are guaranteed, and we must produce well in the future." Although land rights have not been completely determined in the remaining villages, the masses' enthusiasm for production is also extremely high because of the policy of whoever cultivates the land owns the harvest.
　　Many villages have begun to repair houses burned and destroyed by the enemy puppets and Chiang bandits. Puyin Village in the Second District built new houses and repaired 113 old houses. In the fields and open spaces, it can be seen that the boundaries of most cultivated land are neatly repaired. More than 80% of the land in the county has been repaired and the edges have been trimmed. The stubble land in the autumn has been cultivated once. The land that has been barren for years has also begun to be eliminated one after another. This spring, the county originally planned to reclaim 12,000 mu of wasteland, but now more than 16,000 mu have been reclaimed, exceeding the original plan by 35%. In Duanwang Village in the Sixth District, more than 1,000 mu of wasteland was not cultivated before the land reform, and no one admitted that the land was theirs because they were afraid of increasing the burden. When the land certificates were issued, after publicity and explanation, these wastelands have found their owners and have been cultivated one after another. The two water channels of Tianshun and Guanghui in the Fourth District could originally irrigate more than 1,700 mu of farmland, but were destroyed by the Japanese invaders. This year, under the leadership of the government and the active participation of the masses, they have been completely repaired. At the same time, the general farmers have changed their past habits and responded to the government's call to weed wheat.
　　Labor mutual aid is organized and developed under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. At present, a total of 2,523 male labor mutual aid teams have been organized in the county, with 11,902 participants, accounting for 24% of the male full and semi-labor force. At the same time, there are 1,166 women's labor mutual aid teams, with 5,884 participants, accounting for 18% of the female full and semi-labor force. Before the land reform in the Eighth District, thirty-five lazy people have been actively engaged in land production after transformation and education. The number of women participating in field labor has reached 50%.
　　This year, the farmers' urgent need for means of production is rare in the past ten years. This year, sixteen new iron and wood factories have been built in the county, specializing in repairing and manufacturing agricultural tools. According to statistics from January, February, and March, the county has increased by more than 15,000 pieces of agricultural tools of various sizes. At the Mule and Horse Fair in March, the supply and marketing cooperative bought back 300 shares, which were sold out in two days. In Changcun Village in the Third District with 81 households, 17 large agricultural tools such as plows, harrows, and chaff cutters were added this spring, and 384 other hoes, shovels, and weeding tools were added, an average of five pieces per household. This spring, the county has increased a total of 82 head of livestock, partially solving the difficulty of lack of livestock. In addition, due to years of war, the land was barren and unmaintained, and pests were extremely harmful. The masses urgently demanded agents to eliminate them. The county joint cooperative alone sold 856 jin of red alum and 64,340 jin of black alum, exceeding the original plan by three times.
　　At present, the farmers in the county are working hard to complete the county's target of increasing grain production by 80,000 dan (one dou per mu).

　　寿阳土改后气象一新
    农民积极修建房屋，添购农具牲畜，开垦荒地，保证完成增产计划。
    【本报寿阳讯】山西省寿阳县经过土地改革运动后，农村已呈现一片生产发家的新气象。寿阳县一共有一百九十九个行政村，从一九四八年起开始进行土地改革工作。其中有老区五十一个行政村和新区八十九个行政村已先后结束土改；其余村庄，亦仅有部分遗留问题尚待解决。已经完成了土改的村庄，土地证发下后，农民普遍反映：“地权有了保障，今后可要好好生产。”其余村庄地权虽尚未完全确定，但因宣布了谁种谁收的政策，群众生产情绪亦极高涨。
    不少村庄已开始整修被敌伪、蒋匪烧毁、破坏的房舍。二区普堙村即盖新房，修旧房一百一十三间。在田间、旷野，可以看到大部分耕地的地边堰根都修得整整齐齐。全县百分之八十以上的土地都经过了修堎铲边。去秋的茬地都普耕过一遍。历年来荒芜了的土地，也开始陆续消灭。今春全县原计划开荒一万二千亩，现已开出一万六千余亩，超过原计划百分之三十五。六区段王村一千余亩荒地，土改前无人耕种，且因怕增加负担，谁也不承认那一块地是自己的。在发土地证时，经过宣传解释后，这些荒地都已找到了主人，并已陆续开始耕种。四区天顺、广惠两条水渠，原可灌田一千七百余亩，曾被日寇破坏，今年在政府领导和群众积极参加下，已完全修复。同时一般农民都改变了过去的习惯，响应政府号召，进行了锄麦。
    在自愿两利的原则下，组织发展劳动互助。现全县共组织起男变工互助组两千五百二十三组，参加人数有一万一千九百零二人，占男全半劳力的百分之二十四。同时并有妇女变工互助组一千一百六十六组，参加五千八百八十四人，占女全半劳力的百分之十八。八区土改前三十五个懒汉，经过改造教育后，已有二十个积极上地生产。妇女参加田间劳动的已达百分之五十。
    今年农民对生产资料需求的迫切，为十余年来所罕见。全县今年新建铁、木工厂十六处，专门修制农具。根据一、二、三月的统计，全县共增加大小农具一万五千余件。三月骡马大会上，供销社买回三百口铧子，两天就全部卖完。三区八十一户的昌村，今春就增加犁、耙、铡刀等大农具十七件，其他钁、锨、锄等共三百八十四件，每户平均增加五件。全县今春共增牲畜八十二头，部分的解决了牲口缺乏的困难。又因连年战争，土地荒芜失修，害虫为害极大，群众迫切要求药剂除治，仅县联社即卖出了红矾八百五十六斤，黑矾六万四千三百四十斤，超过原计划三倍。
    目前全县农民正在为完成全县增产八万石粮（每亩一斗）而努力。
