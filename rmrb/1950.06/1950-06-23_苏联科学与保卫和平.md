　　Soviet Science and Defending Peace
    Joliot-Curie
    This article is an excerpt from Joliot-Curie's speech at the 12th National Congress of the French Communist Party. The French government recently dismissed Joliot-Curie from his position as Chairman of the French Atomic Energy Commission at the instigation of U.S. imperialism, using this speech as a pretext.
  ——Editor
    The struggle for liberation during the Nazi occupation is still fresh in our memories. In this great movement, the "National Front for the Liberation and Independence of France" closely united men and women with different political views and religions. They unanimously agreed to work towards this common goal: to drive out the invaders.

  The Danger of Atomic War
    Currently, humanity has barely recovered from the horrors of the last war, and yet imperialism is again contemplating launching a new conflict and preparing a war of aggression against the Soviet Union.
    We are doing everything in our power to oppose these criminal preparations.
    Peace is a common goal that is bound to unite all noble people. We must awaken those who are not yet aware of the dangers of war and are therefore serving the war-mongers' war preparations. This war will be a modern war using the most terrifying weapons of destruction.
    This is the danger posed by the atomic bomb and the so-called super hydrogen bomb.
    The cost of such a war would be the deaths of tens of millions of human beings and the destruction of vast amounts of material.
    You already know that an atomic bomb is equivalent to 20,000 tons of the high explosive T.N.T.
    It is a fact that the explosive power of a hydrogen bomb could be a thousand times greater than this, i.e., equivalent to 2 million tons of T.N.T, and there is even the danger that the atomic bomb, which requires a great deal of effort to produce, will become a detonator for an even more powerful and easier-to-produce bomb.
    It can be correctly asserted, as Einstein recently asserted, that the hydrogen bomb poses an extremely serious danger sufficient to destroy countless human beings.
    Of course, the use of these horrific weapons of destruction will not bring victory to those who use them first. We know that the Soviet Union will never be the first to use them.
    Of course, we know that victory will ultimately be won by the people who rise up against it under the leadership of the Soviet Union.
    But progressive people do not want to achieve victory along this path of destruction and death. For all these reasons, the World Peace Defenders' Congress in Stockholm issued a moving appeal to ban the atomic bomb.
    This is the first goal to be achieved. It is very important. This appeal will unite all peace-loving people to act in unison.
    Those who do not immediately sign this declaration run the risk of becoming servants of the war-mongers.
    This appeal is one of the most important factors in the struggle against concrete preparations for a war of aggression.

  The Responsibility of Scientists
    Scientists around the world, who bear a special responsibility in this regard, must participate in this struggle more and more; workers and dockworkers are already carrying out this struggle in all aspects, and they are once again standing at the forefront of the struggle.
    Today we can see scientific papers condemning the use of the atomic bomb in the newspapers of some countries, for example, in the British and American press. I remember one such article, the author of which concluded after discussing the manufacture of atomic weapons: "I refuse to participate in this abominable work." This is a recent one, but before this, scientists in these countries had already called for the prohibition of the atomic bomb and refused to serve the destructive uses of atomic energy.
    If they have stated their position and done so, it is because they feel that they are supported by the workers, by broad public opinion.
    We can also be proud that we are at the forefront of this struggle. We scientists, who are fighting together with the peace defenders against war preparations and for the prohibition of atomic weapons, fully know that if a significant portion of the huge costs of preparing for war were diverted to science and technology to promote human welfare, we could bring much happiness to people.

  Happy Soviet Scientists
    How happy are those scientists who conduct research in the Soviet Union, in all countries where the system of human exploitation no longer exists! When they work in the laboratory, they have a clear conscience because they know that the results of their research will be used to improve the living conditions of mankind and to defend the freedoms won.
    Yes, the Soviet atomic scientists work enthusiastically. They know that their government has turned the people's desire for peace into action and has repeatedly and solemnly suggested to other countries that they ban the atomic bomb.
    They know how to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind, and they have already experimented in this area. But they also know that if the just and effective proposals to ban atomic weapons continue to be rejected, if war criminals are determined to drop the atomic bomb on their land, then their science and technology will be sufficient to deliver a decisive rebuff.
    During my trip to the Soviet Union in October 1949, I was able to witness the enormous development of Soviet science with my own eyes.
    Before that, I had visited Soviet laboratories several times in 1933, 1936, and 1945. In each successive visit, I saw a rapidly rising line of progress. But when I arrived in the Soviet Union in 1949, the enormous progress they had made in those four years from 1945 to 1949 made a strong impression on me, even I can say, surprised me. This surprise showed that I myself had underestimated the vitality of Soviet science, even though I had seen its previous great progress.
    This shows that perhaps I have unconsciously fallen under the influence of our enemies. Extreme vigilance must be exercised on this issue.

  Serving France and All Humanity
    In the struggle to oppose the anti-Soviet war of aggression, I thought of all the men and women scientists who are engaged in scientific work to serve the people. I thought of their brothers and sisters, and of the newcomers who have left us shining examples, those who have already saved the world, and who are the hope of the world.
    This is why progressive scientists, scientists who are communists, will never allow a single iota of their science to be used for an anti-Soviet war. Supported by confidence, we will firmly believe that in doing so we are serving France and all humanity.

　　苏联科学与保卫和平
    约里奥—居里
    本文是约里奥—居里在法国共产党第十二届全国代表大会上的讲词的节要。法国政府最近在美帝国主义指使之下，解除约里奥——居里所任法国原子能委员会主席的职务，就是以这篇讲词作为借口的。  
  ——编者
    纳粹占领期间争取解放的斗争，在我们脑海里记忆犹新。在这个伟大的运动里，“争取法国解放独立全国阵线”紧紧地团结了具有不同的政治见解与宗教观的男女们。他们一致同意为这个共同目标而努力：逐出侵略者。
  原子战的危险
    目前，人类几乎还没有从上次大战的恐怖中恢复过来，而帝国主义却又在想发动一次新的冲突与准备一次对苏联的侵略战争。
    我们尽全力反对这种犯罪的准备。
    和平是一个必然能团结一切高尚人们的共同目标。我们必须使那些尚未意识到战争的危险因而在替战争贩子备战目的服务的人们觉醒过来。这次战争将是使用最可怖的毁灭性武器的一次现代化战争。
    这就是原子弹和所谓超级氢原子弹所造成的危险。
    这样一次战争的代价，将是数以千万计的人类的死亡和巨量物质的毁灭。
    你们已经知道：一颗原子弹相当于两万吨的烈性炸药Ｔ·Ｎ·Ｔ。
    这是事实：氢原子弹的爆炸力可能一千倍于此，即相当于二百万吨Ｔ·Ｎ·Ｔ，而且更有这种危险：就是那种需要费很大力量配制的原子弹，将成为一种威力更大而配制较易的炸弹的雷管。
    可以正确肯定，正像爱因斯坦最近曾肯定过的一样，氢原子弹造成一种足以毁灭无数人类的极端严重危险。
    当然，这些可怖的毁灭性战争武器的运用，并不会给最先使用它们的人带来胜利。我们知道苏联是决不会最先使用它们的。
    当然我们知道：胜利终究将被在苏联领导下起来反抗的人类所赢得。
    但是进步的人们不愿沿着这种毁灭和死亡的道路去获得胜利。如此种种原因，在斯德哥尔摩集会的世界保卫和平者大会乃发出了禁止原子弹的动人呼吁。
    这是要达到的第一个目标。它非常重要。这一呼吁将团结一切热爱和平的人们一致行动起来。
    那些不立即在这张宣言上签名的人，有危险使自己成为战争贩子的仆从。
    在反对具体准备侵略战争的斗争中，这一呼吁是最重要的因素之一。
  科学家的责任
    在这方面负有特殊责任的全世界科学家们，必须愈来愈多地参加这个斗争；工人们，码头工人们已经在各方面进行着这个斗争，他们再一次地站在斗争的最前列。
    我们今天能在某些国家的报刊上，比方在英国和美国的报刊上，看到谴责使用原子弹的科学论文。我记得有这样一篇文章，作者在谈到原子武器的制造之后结语说：“我拒绝参加这种可憎的工作”。这是最近的一篇，但是在这以前，这些国家中已经有科学家号召过禁用原子弹并拒绝替原子能的毁灭性用途服务。
    假如他们已经表明了自己的态度并这样做了，那是因为他们感觉到自己是被工人，被广泛舆论支持着。
    我们也能因我们站在这一斗争的前列而引为骄傲。我们这些与和平保卫者们一起为反对战争准备和争取禁用原子武器而斗争的科学家完全知道：假如把准备战争的庞大费用中重要的一部分转用为以科学和技术来促进人类福利的话，我们能替人们带来许多幸福。
  幸福的苏联科学家
    那些在苏联，在人剥削人的制度不再存在的一切国家里进行研究的科学家多么幸福！当他们在实验室工作时，他们有着纯洁的良心，因为他们知道他们研究所得的结果，将要用来改进人类的生活条件和保卫赢得的自由。
    是的，苏联原子科学家工作是热情的。他们知道：他们的政府已经把人民热爱和平的愿望转变为行动，一再严正地向其他国家建议禁用原子弹。
    他们懂得把原子能用于人类福利的和平用途，而且在这方面他们已经实验过。但是他们也懂得：假如禁用原子武器的正当而有效的建议继续遭到拒绝，假如战争罪犯们决心把原子弹投掷在他们的国土上，那么他们的科学和技术是足够给以决定性回击的。
    在一九四九年十月旅苏期间，我曾经能亲眼看见苏联科学的巨大发展。
    在这以前，我曾经在一九三三年，一九三六年及一九四五年数度参观过苏联的实验室。在每一次接连的参观中，我都看到了迅速上升着的进展图线。但是当我在一九四九年到达苏联时，他们在一九四五到一九四九这四年中所获得的巨大进展给我很强烈的印象，甚至可以说令我吃惊了。这种惊讶表明我自己也过低估计了苏联科学的活力，尽管我曾经见过它以前已有的巨大进展。
    这说明也许我已不自觉地陷入了我们敌人的影响之下。在这个问题上必须具有极度的警惕。
  替法兰西和全人类服务
    在进行斗争以反对反苏的侵略战争时，我想到了那些从事于服务人民的科学工作的一切男女科学家们。我想到了他们的弟兄们，想到了那些给我们留下光辉范例的新人，这些人他们已经拯救了全世界，他们也是世界的希望。
    这就是为什么进步的科学家，身为共产党员的科学家，决不让他们的科学的一丝一毫用于反苏战争的原因。在信心支持下，我们将坚决认为：我们这样做就是替法兰西和全人类服务。
