　　Talking with Soviet Stakhanovite Workers
　　——Diary of a Visit to the Soviet Union, No. 5
　　Zhao Guoyou

　　Around 7:00 PM on May 7th, we returned from visiting the Soviet Mother and Child Sanatorium. Just as we got out of the car and were about to enter the hotel, we saw three young men in their twenties and thirties, neatly dressed in suits and with their hair parted, walking towards us. Looking closely, one of them seemed familiar. I later remembered that he was Comrade Du Binning. He had greeted us when we arrived by train from Moscow to Leningrad. Seeing me, he ran over and shook my hand warmly. At the same time, he pointed to a strong, young fellow among the other two and said, "This is Comrade Burtsevich, a lathe operator, and your colleague." He then introduced the other one, saying, "This is Comrade ××, a reporter from Culture Newspaper." I talked with Comrade Burtsevich and learned that he was also twenty-seven years old, the same age as me. And since we were "fellow tradesmen," we felt especially close. We held hands and walked into room 439 on the third floor. After everyone sat down, I saw that there were no refreshments. I suddenly remembered that I had some sweets from the Mikoyan Candy Factory in my closet, so I took them out and offered them. They refused, warmly saying, "Keep them to take back to China and give to the Chinese children!" And then asked me to sit down and talk. At this time, Comrade Du Binning opened the paper bag he had brought, took out songbooks, a large signed photo of himself, and a dozen or so printed booklets introducing the experiences of the best Stakhanovite workers. There was also a heavy little paper package containing diamond turning tools. He showed them to me one by one. He said to the translator, "These are for Zhao Guoyou to take back to China, and I hope these booklets can be translated and published in the newspaper so that all Chinese workers can use them as research material." I was so happy that I stood up, not knowing what to say, and just kept saying, "Thank you, thank you." He said, "We will do our best to help you with whatever you need." We all sat down again. Later, Comrade Du Binning said, "I have to see you off tomorrow, so let them introduce their experiences to you. I have to go back first…" At this point, there were only four of us left (including a translator comrade). We sat on the sofa, and Comrade Burtsevich took the booklet recording his experiences and introduced it to me from beginning to end. When we encountered some technical terms, the translator couldn't understand them either. The translator comrade quickly picked up the dictionary to look them up, and we were so anxious that we used gestures to communicate. Before we finished looking up the dictionary, we already understood. Old Fu (the translator comrade) said, "It's really tough to translate technical terms!" The reporter quickly helped to look up the dictionary and take notes. The four of us intently looked at the diagrams in the booklet and listened to him finish speaking. Finally, he turned to me and asked, "How did you create your new record?" I introduced the situation of creating the record and the method of improving tools. As a result, he said excitedly, "I hope to have a copy of your booklet!" At that time, I felt very ashamed. I hadn't even printed a booklet, so what could I give him! After Old Fu explained the reason for not publishing the booklet for me, he told me with concern, "We immediately printed a booklet when we had some creative experience in order to promote it throughout the country. You should also try to print it into a booklet when you go back, as this will greatly help production." Finally, the two of us exchanged commemorative badges of our national leaders, and we left each other's mailing addresses in order to establish communication. This sincere friendship made us extremely reluctant to part. Although we had eaten lunch several hours ago, I forgot that I was hungry. After they left, I jumped up and went to dinner.

　　和苏联斯达哈诺夫工作者谈话
    ——访苏日记之五
    赵国有
    五月七日下午七点多钟，我们由苏联妈妈孩子疗养院参观回来。刚下了汽车，将要走进旅馆门口，看见三位穿着笔挺西装，头发分开梳着，都是二三十岁的青年男子走过来。仔细一看，当中有一位似很面熟。后来记起他是杜斌宁同志。我们由莫斯科到列宁格勒，下火车的时候，他曾迎接过我们。这时他看见我就跑过来和我亲密的握手，同时他又指着其他二人中一位身大力强的年青小伙子说：“他是布尔脱盖维奇同志，是镟工，和你同行。”他又介绍另外一位说：“这是文化报记者××同志。”我与布尔脱盖维奇同志谈起来，知道他也是二十七岁，和我同年。又加上“同行见同行”，大家特别亲热。我们拉着手，走进三楼四三九号房间。大伙儿坐下后，我一看没有什么招待的东西，忽然想起衣柜里还有些米高扬糖果工厂送给我的糖，于是就把他拿出来让他们吃。他们不肯吃，还热情的向我说：“你留着带回国去，给中国的小朋友吃吧！”并让我坐下谈话。这时，杜斌宁同志就把他拿来的纸包打开，拿出来歌本、他签好名的大像片和十几本印好的介绍最优秀的斯达哈诺夫工作者经验的小册子，另外还有一个很重的小纸包，包着钻石车刀。他一件一件的都给我看，他对翻译说：“这是给赵国有带回中国去的，并希望把这些册子都翻译一下在报上发表，使全中国工人都可以作为研究材料。”当时把我乐的站起来不知说什么好啦，直说：“谢谢，谢谢。”他说：“你们需要什么帮助，我们都能尽力。”我们都又坐下了。后来杜斌宁同志说：“我明天还要送你们走，请他们给你介绍经验吧，我要先回去……。”这时只剩下我们四个人（一位是翻译同志）。我们坐在沙发上，布尔脱盖维奇同志拿着记载自己的经验的小册子，由头到尾给我介绍。遇到有些技术名词，翻译也弄不通。翻译同志就赶快拿起字典查，急的我们两个人指手划脚。没等查完字典，我们早明白啦。老傅（翻译同志）说：“要翻译技术名词真够呛！”记者跟着紧忙也帮助查字典、记录。我们四个人一直这样聚精会神地看小册子上的图，听他讲完。最后他又转头问我：“你的新纪录怎样创造出来的？”我把创造纪录的情况和改进工具的方法介绍了一下。结果他很兴奋地说：“你的小册子我希望要一本！”当时我很觉得惭愧，我根本就没印过小册子，拿什么给他呀！老傅替我把没有刊印小册子的原因讲清楚后，他很关心的告诉我说：“我们有一点创造经验，当时就印出小册子，以便推广到全国。你们回去也想法把它印成册子吧，这样对生产上帮助是很大的。”最后我们两人交换了两国领袖的纪念章，彼此又留下通信地址，以便建立通信关系。这种真挚友情，真使我们十二分不愿意分手。当时虽然吃过中饭已经好几个钟头啦，我也忘了肚子饿，在他们走后，我才跳着去吃晚饭。
