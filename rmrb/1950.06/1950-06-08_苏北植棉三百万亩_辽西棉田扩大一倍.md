　　Northern Jiangsu Plants Three Million Mu of Cotton; Western Liaoning Cotton Fields Double in Size
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st. The Northern Jiangsu Administrative Region has completed the planting of over 3,443,000 mu of cotton fields, an increase of over 800,000 mu compared to the area planted in the region last year. The cotton planted in early April has now all emerged, with sturdy stems and leaves. In order to promote cotton planting and ensure cotton production, the Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office mobilized 250,000 farmers last winter and spring to manage water and reclaim land in the Northern Jiangsu cotton reclamation area, completing the key reinforcement project of 700 li of seawall, and dredging all nine main rivers flowing into the sea, including the Zi Wu River and the Zhong Zhi River. During the spring plowing season, the Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office also loaned out 130,000 dan of cotton seeds, 63 tons of insecticides, 460 sets of insecticide equipment, 30,000 four-toothed harrows, over 8,000 new-style plows, and 300,000 harrow teeth to support cotton farmers in planting cotton. The people's governments in various cotton-producing areas also widely publicized the grain-cotton price ratio policy promulgated by the Central People's Government through various meetings, which greatly encouraged the cotton farmers' interest in planting cotton. In particular, the cotton farmers who obtained land title deeds after the land reform have unprecedented enthusiasm for planting cotton. From the county and district levels to individual cotton-growing households, cotton production increase plans have been universally established. After planting, more than 80 percent of the cotton fields have been fertilized and ditched to remove alkalinity. One district in Sheyang County alone dug more than 3,400 water ditches. In order to replace all the cotton seeds in the entire region with improved varieties within two to three years and raise cotton production to pre-war levels within three to five years, the Northern Jiangsu Regional People's Government has also established eight cotton purebred management and breeding areas, covering a total area of more than 600,000 mu, specializing in planting Dai Zi cotton and De Zi cotton, and designated ten state-owned cotton farms to conduct cotton planting research in order to create experience to guide various places.
    Shenyang News: Northeast Daily News: Liaoxi Province, the main cotton-producing area in Northeast China, began planting cotton in mid-April and completed it all by May 20. According to preliminary statistics, the sown area in the province has reached more than 1.5 million mu, exceeding the original plan (1,349,000 mu) by more than 151,000 mu, more than double the 700,000 mu last year.

　　苏北植棉三百万亩  辽西棉田扩大一倍
    【新华社上海一日电】苏北行政区已完成三百四十四万三千余亩棉田的播种工作，较去年该区植棉面积增加八十余万亩。四月初下种的棉花现已全部出苗，茎叶茁壮。苏北人民行政公署为推广植棉，保障棉产，曾于去冬今春动员了二十五万农民，在苏北棉垦区治水兴垦，完成了七百华里海堤的重点加修工程，并将子午河、中直河等九条归海干河全部疏通。春耕期间苏北人民行政公署又贷出棉种十三万担、杀虫药剂六十三吨、药械四百六十具、四齿耙三万具、新式耕犁八千余架、耙齿三十万根，扶助棉农进行植棉。各产棉区人民政府并通过各种会议广泛宣传中央人民政府颁布的粮棉比价政策，大大鼓舞了棉农植棉的兴趣。特别是经过土地改革后获得土地执照的棉农，植棉情绪空前高涨。从县区到各植棉户普遍订立了棉花增产计划。下种后有百分之八十以上的棉田均已经过施肥和挖沟爽碱。射阳县的一个区即挖水沟三千四百余条。为着在两三年内把全区全部棉种换成良种，三五年内提高棉花产量到战前水平，苏北区人民政府还建立了八个棉花纯种管理区和繁殖区，面积共六十余万亩，专植岱字棉和德字棉，并指定十个公营棉场进行植棉研究工作，以便创造经验指导各地。
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北主要产棉区——辽西省，自四月中旬开始植棉，至五月二十日已全部完成。据初步统计，该省播种面积已达一百五十多万亩，超过原计划（一百三十四万九千亩）十五万一千多亩，较去年七十万亩扩大了一倍多。
