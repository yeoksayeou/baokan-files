　　China Democratic National Construction Association and Jiusan Society
    Protest MacArthur's Illegal Actions
    Demand Immediate Revocation of Reactionary Order
    [This newspaper reported] To oppose MacArthur's illegal arrest of Japanese patriots and the illegal "purge" of Central Committee members of the Japanese Communist Party, the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Jiusan Society issued protest letters on June 9, severely protesting the illegal actions of MacArthur, the US imperialist's agent in Japan, and his running dog, the reactionary Yoshida government.

    The protest letter from the China Democratic National Construction Association pointed out that MacArthur has completely and undisguisedly destroyed the spirit and provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, and seriously threatens world peace. This is a concrete manifestation of US imperialism preparing for a new war in the Far East.

    MacArthur's suppression of the Japanese Communist Party this time is a declaration of an attack by US imperialism on the Japanese people, and also an attack on peace-loving people all over the world—especially peace-loving people in the Far East. The Chinese people have suffered from exploitation and oppression by US imperialism, and extend infinite concern and sympathy to the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people who are suffering from reactionary persecution. We lodge a serious protest with the US government and MacArthur, demanding the swift withdrawal of MacArthur's illegal measures and guaranteeing that there will never be such acts that violate the democratic rights of the Japanese people again.

    The protest letter from the Jiusan Society said: In recent months, the broad masses of the Japanese people have resisted the tyrannical rule of US imperialism and launched a series of heroic struggles. MacArthur, enraged, has absurdly misinterpreted the Potsdam Declaration and the "purge order," instructing his running dog, the Yoshida government, to deprive twenty-four Central Committee members of the Japanese Communist Party, who have always fought faithfully for Japanese national independence, people's democracy, and world peace, of their public office, party membership, and political activities. This is a prelude to a more brutal suppression of the Japanese Communist Party and the broad masses of the Japanese people. This is US imperialism's signal to provoke a new war in the Far East. We hereby lodge a serious protest against the crazy actions of US imperialism and MacArthur. All peace-loving people in the world should unite more closely, condemn them unanimously, and ensure that US imperialism cancels this reactionary order and ends its tyrannical rule of exclusive control over Japan as soon as possible.

　　中国农工民主党暨九三学社
    抗议麦克阿瑟非法行为
    要求立即撤销反动命令
    【本报讯】为反对麦克阿瑟非法逮捕日本爱国人士和非法“整肃”日共中委，中国农工民主党和九三学社于六月九日分别发表抗议书，严重抗议美帝在日本的代理人麦克阿瑟及其走狗吉田反动政府的非法行为。
    中国农工民主党的抗议书中指出：麦克阿瑟已毫无掩饰地完全毁坏了波茨坦宣言的精神和条文，而严重地威胁着世界的和平。这正是美帝国主义在远东准备新战争的具体表现。
    麦克阿瑟这次对日共的镇压，正是美帝对日本人民进攻的宣告，也就是对世界爱好和平的人民——首先是远东爱好和平人民的一个进攻。中国人民身受过美帝的剥削和压迫，对于正在遭受着反动迫害的日本共产党和日本人民寄与无限的关怀与同情，并向美国政府和麦克阿瑟提出严重的抗议，要求迅速将麦克阿瑟这种违法的措施撤回，并保证永远不再有此等侵犯日本人民的民主权利的行为。
    九三学社的抗议书中说：最近数月来，日本广大人民反抗美帝的横暴统治，展开了一连串的英勇斗争。麦克阿瑟恼羞成怒，竟极端荒谬地曲解波茨坦宣言及“整肃令”，指令其走狗吉田政府，对一向为日本民族独立，人民民主与世界和平而忠贞奋斗的日共二十四名中委剥夺其公职、党籍、与政治活动，这是对日共及日本广大人民更进一步残酷镇压的先声，这是美帝在远东挑拨新战争的红球。对于美帝及麦克阿瑟这种疯狂行为，我们特提出严重的抗议，全世界一切爱好和平的人民，更应紧密团结，一致声讨，务使美帝取消这种反动的命令，并早日结束美帝对日独占的横暴统治。
