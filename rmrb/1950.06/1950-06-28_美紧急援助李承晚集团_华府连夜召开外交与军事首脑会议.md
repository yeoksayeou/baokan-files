Xinhua News Agency, June 27th—The American government, which instigated the Syngman Rhee puppet government to launch this full-scale civil war, is urgently providing large quantities of military supplies to the Syngman Rhee puppet army in an attempt to salvage its failing situation caused by its unsuccessful offensive.

According to reports from the Associated Press and other sources, U.S. President Truman, who was spending his weekend vacation in Missouri, cut short his vacation on the 25th and rushed back to Washington to hold an emergency meeting of diplomatic and military leaders overnight to discuss the Korean situation. The U.S. State Department and the Department of the Army also held special meetings to discuss immediately supplying the Syngman Rhee puppet clique with more weapons. According to the Associated Press, MacArthur, under orders from Washington, is rushing U.S. military supplies to South Korea by transport plane. The first batch of military supplies, including ten Mustang fighter planes, has already been shipped. In addition, several U.S. destroyers sailed from Sasebo on the morning of the 26th to Incheon, the port leading to Seoul. MacArthur declared in a communiqué issued by the U.S. Far East Headquarters: "Naval escorts and air cover will be provided to ensure the safe delivery of these supplies to Korea." According to Reuters, a plane full of U.S. officials flew to South Korea on the 25th to serve as "observers."
