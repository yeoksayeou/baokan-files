    The Story of a Pencil
    Yu Zhen
    (Comic Strip) (Five)
    (Sixteen) As soon as I arrived in the ranks, I felt the warmth of the revolutionary army everywhere. In addition to teaching military skills, they also helped me study politics and culture, helping me to progress. Thinking of the hardship of not being able to study in the past, I was determined to do a good job.
    (Seventeen) I earned two major merits in combat. I also want to be a model in learning culture. Since the Tianjin Campaign, I have been concentrating on hard practice. At first, I learned to read from picture books, learning three characters a day; later, I learned ten new characters a day. If I couldn't learn something myself, I would ask my comrades.
    (Eighteen) No matter how difficult the combat environment was, I would find a branch during rest and practice writing on the ground. I wrote it over and over again. I never slacked off.

    （连环画）（五）
    （十六）我刚到队伍里就感到革命队伍到处是温暖。除了教军事以外，还帮助咱学政治和文化，帮助咱进步。想起从前要学不能学的苦处，我就决心好好干。
    （十七）我在战斗中立了两大功。学习文化也要当模范。自从天津战役后，就专心苦练。起初我看画报识字，每天学习三个；后来一天学十个生字。自己学不会的就向同志们问。
    （十八）不管行国作战环境多困难，休息时找个树枝在地上练习写。写了一遍又一遍。我从来不偷懒。
