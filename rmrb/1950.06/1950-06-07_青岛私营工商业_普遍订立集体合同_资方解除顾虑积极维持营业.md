　　Qingdao Private Industry and Commerce
    Universally Establish Collective Contracts
    Capitalists Relieve Concerns and Actively Maintain Business
    [Jinan News] *Dazhong Daily* news: Qingdao's various private industrial and trade unions have taken the initiative to negotiate and sign collective contracts with capitalists. In thirteen industries, such as the match industry, fishing vessel industry, and highway transportation, and in sixteen industrial and commercial enterprises, a total of twenty-eight industry collective contracts and enterprise collective contracts have been signed. These include 8,556 employees and 1,513 private industrial and commercial owners. Through the signing of collective contracts and continuous consultation, labor-capital relations have begun to enter a normal state. The production and business conditions of industry and commerce have improved. During the consultation, labor and capital first solve the most important issues that both parties need to address, such as wages, employment and dismissal, rights and obligations, etc.

    In the process of signing collective contracts, some private industrialists and businessmen and their representatives feared that they would be restricted after signing the contracts and wanted to add more clauses restricting workers to the contracts; some wanted to reduce wages as much as possible and reduce the benefits they should have. A small number of employees and their individual representatives, only considering their immediate interests, wanted to increase wages or reduce working hours and increase benefits in the contract. The above problems were resolved more correctly through democratic consultation.

    After the collective contract was signed, the unreasonable wage system was appropriately adjusted and improved. Employee benefits that should be and could be provided have also been appropriately and preliminarily resolved. The enthusiasm of employees has gradually increased. For example, the firemen of the Sanxin Bathhouse actively suggested using wood powder instead of coal, which reduced costs and changed the previous loss-making situation. Employees of the Zhonghua Bathhouse took the initiative to help the capitalists save money, turning the bathhouse from loss to profit. The wages of workers in the match industry have been adjusted more reasonably. In the case of shop assistants, extremely unreasonable systems such as arbitrary beatings and scoldings, arbitrary dismissals, and extracting "God of Wealth shares" and "Madam shares" from profits have been abolished. Workers' production enthusiasm has increased significantly.

    After the signing of the contract, due to the active production and cost-saving efforts of workers in some units, many capitalists have dispelled their concerns. Some match factories have begun to add machinery after signing the contract. When the negotiations on the collective contract for the fishing vessel industry were nearing completion, the capitalists actively collected fishing vessels. Employees of the electrical appliance stores actively worked hard to help the capitalists overcome difficulties, and the capitalists also did their best to keep the business going.

    However, the following shortcomings are still manifested in the signing of the contract: First, some capitalists are worried about signing the contract and adopt a perfunctory and delaying attitude; the labor side also has the phenomenon of making excessive demands; this situation shows that a small number of labor and capital are not yet clear about the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital and developing production. Second, a small number of units lacked a democratic and equal spirit during consultation, and the negotiation methods were not flexible enough. Important opinions and information were not exchanged during the deliberation, which made it difficult to solve problems smoothly during the consultation and prolonged the negotiation time. Third, labor and management failed to check the implementation of the contract at a specific time. Individual industrialists and businessmen do not comply with or implement the provisions of the contract. After the collective contract is signed, in order to enable labor and management to consult at any time on the basis of the collective contract on temporary issues that urgently need to be resolved, it is necessary to establish a regular labor-management consultation meeting and strengthen regular labor-management consultation, which has not been done enough.

### 青岛私营工商业  普遍订立集体合同  资方解除顾虑积极维持营业

　　青岛私营工商业
    普遍订立集体合同
    资方解除顾虑积极维持营业
    【济南讯】大众日报消息：青岛市各私营产业、行业工会，主动与资方协商订立集体合同。在火柴业、渔轮业、公路汽车运输等十三个行业，和十六个工商企业单位中，已订立行业集体合同和企业集体合同共二十八件。包括八千五百五十六名职工和一千五百一十三户私营工商业主。经过订立集体合同与不断的协商，劳资关系开始纳入正常状态。工商业的生产、营业情况已有起色。劳资在协商中，首先解决双方最需要解决的重要问题，如工资，雇用与解雇，权利与义务等。
    在订立集体合同的过程中，部分私营工商业家及其代表，怕订立合同后，自己受了限制，想在合同上多订一些限制工人的条款；有的想尽量减低工资，减少应有的福利。少数职工与其个别代表，只顾眼前利益，想在合同中提高工资或减少工作时间，多增加点福利。上述问题经过民主协商，均较正确地获得解决。
    在集体合同订立后，不合理的工资制度，得到了适当地调整和改善。应该办而又可能办的职工福利，亦得到了适当的、初步的解决。职工的积极性逐步提高。如澡塘业三新楼烧火工人，积极建议以木粉代替煤炭，降低了成本，改变了过去赔累的状况。中华池职工主动帮助资方节约，使该塘转亏为盈。火柴业工人工资调整的较合理。在店员中取消了随便打骂、随便解雇及从盈利中抽“财神股”、“太太股”等极不合理的制度。工人生产情绪显著提高。
    订立合同后，由于有些单位的工人积极生产节约，降低了成本，不少资本家已打破了顾虑。有些火柴厂订立合同后，开始增添机器。渔轮业资方在集体合同大体谈判告一段落时，即积极搜集渔轮。电料行职工积极努力，帮助资方克服困难，资方也尽了最大努力，使营业维持下来。
    但在订立合同中仍表现如下缺点：一、有的资方对订合同有顾虑，采取应付拖延的态度；劳方亦有要求过高的现象；这种情况说明，少数劳方和资方对于劳资两利，发展生产的方针尚不明确。二、少数单位协商时民主平等精神不够，谈判协商的方式不够灵活。酝酿时未能交换有关重要意见和情况，以致协商中难以顺利解决问题，延长了谈判的时间。三、劳资双方未能按一定时间检查合同执行情形。有个别行业的工商业者不遵守、不执行合同的规定。订立集体合同后，为了能够在集体合同的基础上，使劳资双方能随时协商，迫切需要解决的临时发生的问题，就必须建立经常性的劳资协商会议，加强经常性的劳资协商，这点做的也不够。
