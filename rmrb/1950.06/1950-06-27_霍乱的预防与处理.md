　　Cholera Prevention and Treatment
    Hu Shuqi
    Cholera is the Chinese name; the foreign name is "虎列拉" (Hǔ liè lā, a transliteration of Cholera).

    The transmission vectors of cholera are water, flies, food, utensils, and people carrying cholera bacteria, etc. The fine hairs on flies' feet can carry millions of bacteria, spreading them onto people's food. Bacteria on patients' utensils can also be transmitted to healthy people. Washing patients' vomit, excrement, and contaminated clothing in rivers often causes great harm, especially dumping patients' feces into the river, which is even more dangerous. Therefore, the spread of cholera is most often through drinking water. So, the important points for preventing cholera are as follows:

    I. Check the stool of people who have been in contact with the patient to determine if they are carriers.

    II. Water used for drinking, gargling, and washing dishes must be boiled.

    III. Strictly prevent flies from contacting food. Especially during the epidemic period of cholera, only eat cooked food, and avoid putting ice in food and drinks.

    IV. It is strictly forbidden to expose patients' feces outside or put them into drinking water.

    V. Complete handling of waste, establish more isolation hospitals, lay perfect underground drains, and improve public health.

    VI. Promote health education.

    VII. Compulsory vaccination.

    VIII. As soon as cholera is discovered, immediately implement inspection, control, and examination of the central area of ​​infection to discover early patients and isolate them.

    Cholera is most common in China during the turn of summer and autumn. And more men than women, and more adults than children, get the disease. The mortality rate averages from 30% to 70%, usually around 60%, which is quite alarming. Therefore, if we find a patient or a suspected patient, we should immediately handle the following procedures:

    I. Report to the health authorities or infectious disease hospital, and examine the stool to confirm whether it is cholera and determine the treatment method.

    II. Send the patient to the hospital for isolation, or install screens on the windows and doors around the patient's bedroom to prevent flies from entering.

    III. Immediately eliminate the patient's stool and vomit. Items that the patient has used or contacted must be disinfected. The patient's leftover food should be burned. Bedding and daily necessities must be disinfected by boiling. Use 5% Lysol or bleaching powder for spittoons. Sputum and secretions on paper and handkerchiefs should be burned or boiled, and feces can be disinfected with Lysol.

    IV. The house where the patient lived must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.

    V. People who have been in contact with the patient must be vaccinated immediately.

    VI. Except for medical staff who diagnose, treat, and take care of the patient's chores, no one is allowed to enter the patient's bedroom.

    VII. After a cholera patient dies, cremation is best.

    VIII. Investigate the source of the infection, look for unclean food and drinking water, and patients who have not reported the disease.

    The number of vaccinations is two or three, and the reliable immunity lasts for about half a year. The density of bacteria in the vaccine is about 3 billion or 6 billion per cubic centimeter. Pregnant women should not use it during injection. Sometimes, there is also only one injection of the vaccine, and the injection amount is the same as the injection amount for the two or three injection method. However, because this single-dose vaccine also contains 6 billion dead bacteria, its injection has the same effect as two or three injections.

    Generally, people feel mysterious and terrified about cholera, but the symptoms of cholera are very obvious, and they are exactly the same for children and adults. Some mild cases are mainly "rice water" diarrhea, and perhaps diarrhea is the only characteristic. But severe cases develop urine like rice water, vomiting, and dehydration. The general symptoms of dehydration are thirst, muscle pain, and fainting. The incubation period of cholera is only half a day in some cases, but as long as seven days in others. However, it usually lasts two or three days. The entire course of cholera can be roughly divided into the following four stages:

    The first stage: sudden diarrhea, six or seven times a day, thirst, vomiting, loss of appetite, physical fatigue, reduced urine output, leg pain, but no abdominal pain. This is a simple cholera diarrhea, and sometimes it will heal quickly.

    The second stage is the cholera period, which is mild cholera. It usually turns into this stage a few hours or a day after the onset. The whole body is tired, there is no appetite at all, vomiting does not stop, the stool is thin and colorless, like rice water, and it is discharged seven or eight or more than ten times a day, straight down, and the stool contains a large number of bacteria. At the same time, the patient's blood pressure drops, collapses, the skin is loose, the pulse is weak, the complexion is bluish-purple, the breath is short, the eyes are sunken, the voice is low, the muscles have painful cramps, and the feet are most often dangling. The limbs are cold, the body temperature is normal, the urine output is very small, or even no urine, but there is still hope of recovery after five or six days.

    The third stage is the cold collapse stage, which is "true cholera." It only takes two or three hours for the second stage to turn into this stage. The patient's blood circulation is disordered, the appetite is completely closed, the whole body is weak, and he sleeps like death, entering the "cold collapse false death period." The pulse is difficult to feel, and the blood is thick. This situation is a precursor to uremia. The fierce can die in seven or eight hours, but some die of exhaustion after two or three days. If the vomiting and diarrhea gradually stop, the heart gradually recovers, the pulse gradually increases, and the urine is clear after one or two days of false death, the danger period passes. It takes about two or three weeks to recover, but during the recovery process, it can still develop fever and enter the next stage.

    The fourth stage is the cholera typhoid fever stage. The body temperature rises slightly to above 39 degrees Celsius. Although vomiting and diarrhea are relieved or temporarily stopped, the pulse returns to normal, the breathing is deep and long, the urine contains protein, the blood is thick, the white blood cells increase, and the substances in the urine accumulate in the blood. The tongue is dry and stiff, showing symptoms of nerve poisoning. Rashes often occur on the limbs, and sometimes there are rashes all over the body. Inflammation of the kidneys often results in death from uremia. If the blood urea decreases, there may be hope of recovery.

　　霍乱的预防与处理
    胡树杞
    霍乱是中国名词，外国名词叫“虎列拉”。
    霍乱病的传染媒介，是水、苍蝇、食物、用具，以及带有霍乱菌的人等等。苍蝇脚上细毛，能带千万病菌，散布于人们的食物上，病人用具上的细菌，也能够传染给健康的人。而病人的吐泻物及污染的衣物等，于河中洗涤，常常引起大患，尤其是将病人的大便倾入河中，为害更烈。所以霍乱病的传布，以从饮水而来的为最多。所以霍乱病的预防，重要的有以下几点：
    一、检查接触过病人的人的大便，以确定是否带菌。
    二、用作饮料、漱口、洗碗筷的水，必须一律煮沸。
    三、严防苍蝇接触食物。尤其是在霍乱病的流行期间，只吃煮熟的食物，忌冰放在饮食物里。
    四、严禁病人的大便暴露外边，或投入饮水中。
    五、完备的处理污物，多设隔离医院，铺设完善的暗沟，改良公共卫生。
    六、推行卫生教育。
    七、强迫注射菌苗。
    八、一有霍乱病发现，即刻实施检查制、控制、检验传染的中心区域，以便发现初期病人，予以隔离。
    霍乱病在我国多见于夏秋之交。而得病的人，男多于女，成人多于小孩。死亡率平均自百分之三十到百分之七十，通常的都是在百分之六十左右，这实在是够惊人的。所以我们如果发现病人或有嫌疑的病人的时候，应该立刻办理下述的手续：
    一、报告卫生当局或传染病医院，检验大便，以资证实是否霍乱病，而确定治疗方法。
    二、病人送至医院隔离，或将病人卧室四周装置纱窗，纱门，以免苍蝇飞入。
    三、立刻消灭病人的大便和呕吐物。病人用过或接触过的东西，均必须予以消毒。病人吃剩的食物，应该予以焚毁。寝具日用品等必须采用煮沸法予以消毒。痰盂用百分之五的来苏耳或漂白粉。纸和手帕上的痰和分泌物，予以焚烧或煮沸，粪便可用来苏耳消毒。
    四、病人住过的房屋，必须彻底的予以扫除和消毒。
    五、接触过病人的人，必须立刻注射防疫针。
    六、除诊治和料理病人琐事的医务人员外，严禁进入病人的卧室。
    七、霍乱病人死后，最好采用火葬。
    八、调查传染的来源，找寻不洁的食物和饮水，以及有病未报的病人。
    防疫针注射的次数，有两回的，也有三回的，可靠免疫力均约半年，疫苗含菌的密度，大约每立方公分含三十亿或六十亿，注射时孕妇忌用。有时，预防针也有只注射一回的，注射分量也和两回注射法及三回注射法每回注射的分量相同，但是因为这种一次注射疫苗中，同样含有六十亿死菌，所以它的注射，与注射两回或三回的功效完全相同。
    一般人对于霍乱病都感到神秘与恐怖，其实霍乱病的症状是很显著的，小孩和成人是完全一样。有些轻症主要的是“米泔汁”水泻，也许水泻是唯一的特征。但严重的则发生像米泔汁一样的小便，呕吐和脱水的现象，脱水的一般症状是口渴，肌肉疼痛与昏厥。而霍乱病的潜伏期，有的仅仅只有半天，但有的却长达七天，不过，一般的都是两天或三天。霍乱病的全部进程，大概可分为下述四期：
    第一期，突然发生腹泻，一天六七次，口渴，呕吐，食欲不振，身体疲劳，尿量减少，下腿疼痛，但肚子不疼，这是一种单纯性的霍乱下痢，有时很快的就会痊愈的。
    第二期便是霍乱期了，这是轻症霍乱，大约在起病后数小时或一日后转入此期。全身疲倦，食欲全无，呕吐不停，大便稀薄而无色，好像米泔一样，一昼夜要泻七八次或十余次不定，直冲而下，便中含有大量细菌。同时，病人的血压降低，虚脱，皮肤松弛，脉搏微弱，面色青紫，气息短促，双目深陷，声音低弱，肌肉有痛性痉挛，吊脚最多。四肢厥冷，体温在常度下，尿量极少，甚至没有小便，但是五六日后仍有痊愈希望。
    第三期是冷厥期，也就是“真性霍乱”，快的仅二三小时，便由第二期转入此期，病人血液循环错乱，胃口全闭，全身萎弱，沉睡如死，入于“冷厥假死期”，脉搏难以扪觉，血液稠厚，这种情形乃属尿毒症的先兆。凶者七八小时即可死亡，但也有拖二三天后，虚脱而死的。如果过假死期一二天后，吐泻渐停，心力渐复，脉搏渐旺，小便通后，危险期遂过，约经二三星期后，才能够复原，但是在复原过程中，犹能发热转入下一期。
    第四期是霍乱伤寒期，体温略升热至摄氏三十九度以上，吐泻虽缓，或暂停止，脉搏转住，呼吸深长，小便含蛋白质，血液稠厚，白血球增多，尿内物质壅积血内。舌干呆木，呈现神经中毒症状。四肢往往发疹，有时全身有皮疹。肾脏发炎，结果多因尿毒症而死。如果血液尿素减少，则可能有痊愈希望。
