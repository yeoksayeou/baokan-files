Why Preserve the Rich Peasant Economy?
    Wang Yin Sheng
    Recently, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference unanimously approved Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's "Report on Land Reform Issues" and, in principle, passed the draft Land Reform Law. It was decided that, starting this winter, land reform in the new areas would be completed in phases and regions over two and a half to three years. The land of the landlord class will be confiscated and distributed to landless and land-poor peasants, while preserving the rich peasant economy to promote agricultural production. This decision is fully in line with the demands of the people of the whole country and the current new situation in the country. However, some landlords and those related to the landlord class always think about the narrow and current interests of the landlord class and are unwilling to think from the broad and long-term interests of the people of the whole country, and always oppose and doubt the land reform. Some poor peasants, hired peasants, and working cadres are wondering why the new area land reform should preserve the rich peasant economy instead of carrying out a more thorough land reform. We must explain both aspects of these issues; otherwise, it will make land reform in the new areas difficult and delay the recovery and development of national production.
            (I) Why implement land reform?
    This question has been talked about for many years. Before the War of Resistance, landlords, who accounted for less than 4 percent of the rural population nationwide, owned about 50 percent of the land. They used this to cruelly exploit peasants, so that poor and hired peasants, who accounted for 70 percent of the rural population but owned only 17 percent of the rural land, toiled from morning till night all year round but could not get enough to eat or wear. This unreasonable situation, after the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the four-year War of Liberation, has been largely eliminated in Northeast and North China, where land reform has been basically completed (except for a few disaster areas in North China); but in other areas, the situation remains the same, and in some areas it has even deteriorated compared to before the war. In East China and Central South China, 30 to 40 percent of the rural land is landlord land and public land; in many areas of Sichuan, the land owned by landlords accounts for more than 80 percent of the rural land. Under this unreasonable land system, five to seven-tenths of the harvest obtained by peasants through year-round labor must be consumed on rent that hinders agricultural production; and for agricultural production itself, they even lack the ability to invest the most necessary capital that has been traditional for thousands of years. The work of applying manure and weeding cannot be carried out fully and appropriately due to lack of funds. All their surplus labor, and even part of their necessary labor and original capital, are taken away by the landlords every year. It is extremely difficult for them to maintain simple reproduction every year, so how can they have the surplus capacity to expand reproduction! Eighty percent of the Chinese people are peasants, and if agricultural production cannot be expanded and the purchasing power of peasants cannot be increased, how can there be a sufficient supply of raw materials and food needed by industry? How can the sales of industrial products be expanded? How can commerce be developed?
    The difficulties encountered by the industrial and commercial sectors recently, after analysis and research by industrialists and businessmen, economists, and administrative departments, have been unanimously considered to be fundamentally due to the relationship between the years of war and the greatly weakened purchasing power of peasants. To fundamentally solve this difficulty, we must wait for the completion of land reform across the country in two or three years and the rise in peasants' purchasing power.
    If land reform is not thoroughly implemented and the landlord class is not eliminated, then neither agriculture, industry, nor commerce can recover and develop. Therefore, the independence, freedom, democracy, and unity of New Democratic China cannot be consolidated. If the land on which the vast majority of the people of the country produce and live is held in the hands of the smallest number of landlords, then what democracy and freedom can there be?!
    However, some landlords and those related to the landlord class always oppose or doubt the land reform. The main reasons they hold to oppose land reform are: first, they say that the landlords' land was bought by them through "hard work and thrift" and through the form of "free buying and selling," and rented out through "free contractual relations," so it should not be confiscated; second, if the landlords' land is confiscated, then why not confiscate the capitalists' capital? These are completely words that distort the facts and confuse right and wrong, limited by class interests. First of all, the landlord class, as a class, has never spent a single effort on the land. The land originally existed before mankind. It is all the peasants who improve the land and cultivate the land, and the landlord class only spends its efforts on exploiting peasants and annexing land. All its land is only the accumulation of exploitation of peasants. Taking from the peasants and returning it to the peasants is only natural. As for individual small landlords, in the early stages of their development, some may have "started with hard work and thrift"; but when they have already become landlords and live a parasitic life for a long time, then what they previously gained through their own hard work and thrift has long been exhausted, and their lives are entirely supported by feudal exploitation. For those who truly purchase small pieces of land with their own labor income, and who have to rent it out because they are engaged in other occupations or lack labor, the above-mentioned land reform law stipulates that they are not regarded as landlords, as long as the land they rent out does not exceed twice the local average per person, they can continue to rent it out or cultivate it themselves without being requisitioned. Apart from this kind of small rented land, other land should be confiscated. Secondly, the "freedom" of buying and selling and renting, the landlord class does have freedom and has too much freedom. Before liberation, the form of land sales was mostly that landlords, when peasants could not pay rent or high-interest debts, used their political power to seize land at an unequal price. Whether to buy or not, the landlord is extremely "free"; but the peasants have no "freedom" at all. The so-called "free contractual tenancy relationship" is also that after peasants are deprived of their land, they have no way to live and are forced to accept the landlord's extra-economic high rent and additional labor exploitation. Whether to sign the contract or not, the landlord is completely "free" and can use his political power to arbitrarily break the contract; but the peasants cannot have "freedom" at all. Thirdly, although the capitalists' capital and the landlords' land are both tools for exploiting the working masses, in today's China, the former's exploitation can increase national wealth, help production develop, and reduce worker unemployment; while the latter's exploitation will only hinder agricultural production development and increase peasants' suffering. Therefore, today's people's revolution only opposes the feudal exploitation of landlords, and does not oppose the capitalist exploitation of capitalists. The New Democratic Revolution protects private property, it does not abolish private land ownership, but only changes the feudal and semi-feudal land ownership system into the peasants' land ownership system. When peasants own land themselves, they can not only eliminate their heavy rent burden, thus increasing their capital in agriculture, but also greatly increase their enthusiasm for production. The unprecedented surge in peasants' production enthusiasm in Northeast and North China after land reform is a great proof of this.
    Land reform only abolishes the feudal land system of exploitation, eliminates the parasitic landlord class that relies on this system to gain without labor, but does not physically eliminate individual landlords (only local bullies and evil gentry who have committed heinous crimes and seriously resist land reform will be sentenced to death by the court); and it is also necessary to transform individual landlords into self-reliant laborers or people engaged in industry and commerce, so that they can be transformed from socially useless people into socially useful people. The land reform measures recently passed by the CPPCC National Committee, in addition to land and farm animals and farm tools necessary for agricultural production, as well as surplus houses and surplus grain in rural areas, the landlord's other property, including the industry and commerce it operates, will not be confiscated, and even the land, farm animals, and farm tools that are stipulated to be confiscated above will also be distributed to the landlords in the same way as to the peasants, so that the landlords can also rely on their own labor to maintain their lives and transform themselves in labor. This is precisely the road to the regeneration of individual landlords; there should be no more nostalgia for the shameful parasitic life of the past.
            (II) Why preserve the rich peasant economy in the new area land reform?
    The draft land reform law, which was principally passed by the CPPCC National Committee this time, clearly stipulates that "the rich peasant economy should be preserved and the land property of rich peasants should not be touched"; "the land and other property cultivated by rich peasants themselves and cultivated by hired laborers should not be violated." The reason why the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy is adopted today is necessary in both economic and political terms.
    "In order to deal with the oppression of imperialism, in order to improve the backward economic status, China must utilize all urban and rural capitalist factors that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood but not harmful, unite the national bourgeoisie, and strive together." This is Chairman Mao's instruction in On People's Democratic Dictatorship, and it is also the main reason why we must preserve the rich peasant economy in the new area land reform.
    In the past land reform, because it was limited by the war environment, it was impossible to adopt the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy. Therefore, on the one hand, it caused the destruction of the old-style rich peasant production; on the other hand, it made some middle peasants waver. After the land reform, many middle peasants had many ideological concerns. Although what we opposed at that time was only the old-style rich peasants with semi-feudal exploitation, not the new-style rich peasants, they were confused and afraid of "standing out" and rising to become rich peasants. Therefore, either they do not work hard enough to produce, or they produce, eat and drink heavily, and are unwilling to make every effort to develop production. In order to promote agricultural production, to avoid the destruction of rich peasant production and the ideological concerns of some middle peasants, we also need to adopt a policy of preserving the rich peasant economy.
    By adopting the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy, we can strive to neutralize the rich peasants and consolidate the unity of the middle peasants during the land reform, so that the landlord class is completely isolated, thus reducing the resistance to land reform to a minimum. In the past, it took twelve years in North China and five years in Northeast China to complete or basically complete land reform for 145 million agricultural population; and now it is necessary to basically complete land reform for 264 million agricultural population in two and a half to three years. This is an unprecedented great undertaking in the history of China for thousands of years. Naturally, the military and political conditions are fundamentally different now and cannot be compared with the past. Now we can use the experience of the past for a long time. Now, according to the degree of awareness and organizational ability of the peasants in various places, as well as the local order and the conditions of the cadres, we have adopted the method of completing the land reform in phases and regions. However, in this winter alone, land reform will be carried out for 100 million rural population. This 100 million rural population is not a small number. Now, except for China, the entire population of all new democratic countries is only 100 million with a zero. It is not an easy task to solve the land reform problem related to the life and death of such a large population in a short winter. Especially after the basic victory of the National War of Liberation, we must complete the new area land reform more systematically, orderly, and so quickly. It is impossible not to take more measures to isolate the landlords and reduce the resistance.
    Adopting the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy can also reduce the difficulties in the work of cadres. Especially when dividing classes, it is not difficult to distinguish between landlords and rich peasants; but sometimes there will be confusion between rich peasants and middle peasants, so in the past, there have been cases of classifying wealthy middle peasants as rich peasants, resulting in infringement of the interests of middle peasants. By adopting the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy, the possibility of such deviations can be reduced.
    However, there are a few poor peasants, hired peasants, and a few working cadres who have considerable concerns and doubts about this policy. They worry whether this method can meet the requirements of the poor and hired peasants; whether the old-style rich peasants can avoid problems; at the same time, they doubt whether the policy of distributing the surplus land property of rich peasants in the past was wrong since the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy is now adopted. The reason why these concerns and doubts arise is because they did not consider the land reform issue in connection with the fundamentally different situation today and in the past. In the past, when land reform was implemented, the People's Liberation Army and the Kuomintang reactionaries were engaged in a life-and-death struggle, and the outcome was uncertain. Winning the victory of the war was the highest interest of the people of the whole country at that time. On the one hand, the People's Liberation War required peasants to send troops, pay public grain, and provide compulsory labor to support the front; on the other hand, at that time, the rich peasants did not believe that the people could win, and were still inclined to the landlord class and the reactionary regime, opposing land reform and the People's Liberation War; therefore, we must allow peasants to levy the surplus land property of rich peasants in order to satisfy the requirements of the poor peasants as much as possible, mobilize the high revolutionary enthusiasm of peasants to participate in and support the People's Liberation War, and overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary regime supported by imperialism. This was completely necessary and correct at that time. But today, the People's Liberation War has basically won, the final elimination of the reactionaries is beyond doubt, and the burden on peasants has also been reduced. The difficulties faced by peasants due to the lack of a part of land can be solved by the state providing loans; therefore, today, the poor and hired peasants in the new areas no longer need to demand to divide the surplus land property of the rich peasants. At the same time, the revolutionary unity of all democratic classes has been formed today, and the attitude of the rich peasants has changed. As long as the People's Government implements the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy, it can strive to neutralize the rich peasants. Whether a part or all of the rented part of its land should be requisitioned can be decided by the people's government above its provincial level according to the circumstances; the wage and interest conditions for hiring workers or lending money and grain can be resolved by separate consultation between it and the hired workers and borrowers; it must reduce rent according to the rent reduction method for renting out surplus land; it is no longer possible for it to carry out semi-feudal exploitation like before. Therefore, the rich peasant economy is what we must preserve today.
    The preservation of the rich peasant economy is not only necessary when implementing land reform and in the short period after land reform; but also in the long term in the future, in the entire new democratic stage. Only when machine cultivation can be universally adopted in rural areas, collective farms can be organized, and the socialist transformation in rural areas is implemented, will the rich peasant economy not need to exist. But this will be in the rather distant future.
    Today, the main problem placed before us, in addition to striving for the overall victory of the People's Liberation War, is to strive for the rapid recovery and development of the people's economy. We must eliminate all resistance that hinders the recovery and development of production, so we must quickly complete the national land reform, which is also what the people of the whole country urgently demand.

　　为什么要保存富农经济？
    王寅生
    最近人民政协全国委员会全体一致同意了刘少奇副主席“关于土地改革问题的报告”，并在原则上通过了土地改革法草案，决定从今年冬季起，在两年半到三年内，分区分期地完成新区土改，没收地主阶级的土地，分配给无地少地的农民，同时保存富农经济，以促进农业生产。这一决定是完全符合于全国人民的要求和今日的全国新形势的。但是有些地主阶级和与地主阶级有关系的人，总是想着地主阶级窄狭的和目前的利益，而不肯从全国人民广大的和长远的利益着想，总是反对和怀疑着土改。另有一些贫雇农和工作干部，又想着为什么新区土改要保存富农经济而不更彻底地进行。这两方面的问题，我们都得给以解释；不然便会使新区土改发生困难，延缓全国生产的恢复和发展。
            （一）为什么要实行土改？
    这个问题原是已谈了多少年的老问题。在抗战之前，全国大约占乡村人口不到百分之四的地主，占有约百分之五十的土地，它们借以残酷剥削农民，使得占乡村人口百分之七十而只占乡村土地百分之十七的贫雇农终年起早落晚地劳作，而得不到温饱的生活。这一种不合理的情形，经过了八年抗日战争和四年解放战争，在东北和华北，已大体消灭，已基本上完成了土改（除华北少数灾区外）；但在其它地区，则情况依然，有的比较战前更形恶化。华东和华中南两区有百分之三十至四十的农村土地都是地主土地和公地；四川不少地区地主所占有的土地要占到农村土地的百分之八十以上。在这种不合理的土地制度底下，农民终年劳动所得到的收获，十分之五至十分之七都要消耗于妨碍农业生产的地租上面；而对于农业生产本身，却反连几千年来传统的最必要的本钱也无力如数投入。上粪除草的工作都因缺乏资力而不能充分地适当地进行。他们的全部剩余劳动，甚至于一部分必要劳动和原有本钱，都要年年被地主拿去。他们每年要维持简单再生产还万分困难，那里还有余力来扩大再生产！中国人民十分之八都是农民，农业生产不能扩大，农民购买力不能提高，使工业所必需的原料和食粮如何能有充分供应？工业产品的销路如何能扩张？商业如何能发展？
    最近工商业界所遇到的困难，经全国工商业家、经济学家以及行政主管部分各方分析研究结果，一致认为，它的最根本原因是连年战争，农民购买力大大削弱的关系。要根本解除这困难，必须等待两三年全国土改完成、农民购买力上升之后。
    如不彻底实行土改，消灭地主阶级，则不论农工商业都无法恢复和发展。因而新民主主义中国的独立、自由、民主与统一，也不能巩固。如果全国最大多数的人民所借以生产和生活的土地，都把持在占全国人口最少数的地主阶级手里，则还有什么民主自由可言？！
    但是有些地主阶级和与地主阶级有关系的人总是反对或怀疑着土改。他们所持以反对土改的主要理由：第一是说地主的土地，是由它们自己“勤俭起家”，经过“自由买卖”的形式买得来，也是经过“自由契约关系”租出去，不应该没收；第二要是没收地主的土地，又为什么不没收资本家的资本。这些完全是为阶级利益所限，歪曲事实，混淆是非的话。首先，地主阶级，作为一个阶级来说，它总没有对土地费过一点力量。土地原是先人类而存在的东西。改良土地和耕种土地的又全是农民，地主阶级所费的力量只是在剥削农民和兼并土地上。它所有的土地只是对农民剥削的积累。取诸农民，还诸农民，理所当然。至于个别小地主，在它们发展初期，或有“勤俭起家”的；但当它们已经成为地主，长期过着寄生生活，则其以前自己勤俭所得，已早消耗完结，它们的生活已全靠封建剥削来支持。对于那些真以自己劳动所得购买的小块土地，而自己又因从事其它职业，或因缺乏劳动力，不得不把它出租的人，在上述土地改革法中，已规定并不作为地主，只要他所出租的土地，不超过当地每人平均数的两倍，便可继续出租或自耕，不加征收。除开了这种小块出租土地，其它便理该没收。其次，所谓买卖和租佃的“自由”，在地主阶级确是有自由而且是有了太多了的。解放前的土地买卖形式，大都是在农民交不起租，还不清高利贷债务时，地主们利用其政治力量，巧取豪夺地把土地绝不等价地买到手里。买与不买，在地主自极端“自由”；但在农民则那有丝毫“自由”可言。所谓“自由契约的租佃关系”，也是农民在被剥夺了土地之后，没有办法生活，被迫着不得不接受地主的超经济的高额地租和额外劳役的剥削。契约的订和不订，在地主自完全“自由”，而且可利用其政治力量任意毁约；但在农民则完全不能有“自由”的。再其次，资本家的资本和地主的土地虽同为剥削劳动大众的工具，但在今日中国，前者剥削了，可以增加国家财富，帮助生产发展，减少工人失业；而后者剥削了，却只会阻碍农业生产发展，增加农民生活痛苦。所以今日人民革命只反对地主的封建剥削，而不反对资本家的资本主义剥削。新民主主义革命是保护私人财产的，它并不取消土地私有制，只是把封建半封建的土地所有制改变为农民土地所有制。农民自己有了土地，就不但可取消其苛重的地租负担，因而可增加它在农业方面的本钱，而且可以大大提高其生产热忱。土改后东北和华北农民生产热忱的空前高涨，就是一大证明。
    土地改革只是废除封建剥削的土地制度，消灭依靠这种制度不劳而获的寄生的地主阶级，而不是在肉体上消灭地主个人（只有罪大恶极的土豪劣绅以及坚决反抗土改的严重犯罪分子，才会由法庭判处死刑）；并要改造地主个人为自食其力的劳动人民或经营工商业的人，使由社会无用之人变为社会有用之人。最近政协全委会所通过的土改办法，除开土地和进行农业生产所必需的耕畜、农具以及在乡村中多余的房屋和多余的粮食外，地主的其它财产，包括它所经营的工商业在内，不加没收，而且就是上述所规定要没收的土地、耕畜、农具，在没收后，也同农民一样分给地主一份，使地主也能依靠自己的劳动维持生活，并在劳动中改造自己。这正是地主个人的再生之路；对于过去的可耻的寄生生活，不该再有所留恋了。
            （二）新区土改为什么要保存富农经济？
    这次政协全委会所原则通过的土地改革法草案中已明文规定“保存富农经济，不动富农的土地财产”；“富农自耕和雇人耕种的土地及其他财产，均不得侵犯”。今日所以采取这保存富农经济的政策，实有经济上和政治上两方面的必要的。
    “为了对付帝国主义的压迫，为了使落后的经济地位提高一步，中国必须利用一切于国计民生有利而不是有害的城乡资本主义因素，团结民族资产阶级，共同奋斗”。这是毛主席在论人民民主专政中的指示，也是我们在新区土改所以必须保存富农经济的主要原因。
    过去土改，因为限于战争环境，不能采取保存富农经济的政策，因此，一方面引起旧式富农生产的破坏；另方面使得若干中农发生动摇现象。土改后不少中农存着许多思想顾虑，虽则那时我们所反对的只是带有半封建性剥削的旧式富农，而不是新式富农，但是它们搞不清，只怕“冒尖”，上升为富农成份。因此它们不是不充分努力生产，便是生产了，大吃大喝，不肯尽力发展生产。我们为着促进农业生产，免除富农生产的破坏以及若干中农的思想顾虑，便也有采取保存富农经济政策的必要。
    采取了保存富农经济政策，在土改时，便可争取中立富农，巩固团结中农，使地主阶级完全陷于孤立地位，因而使土改的阻力减缩到极小。过去，华北十二年，东北五年，才完成或基本上完成了一亿四千五百万农业人口的土改；而现在要在两年半到三年内基本上完成二亿六千四百万农业人口的土改，这是中国几千年历史上空前的伟大事业。自然现在军事的和政治的条件都已根本不同，不能和过去相提并论。现在可以利用过去长时期的经验。现在已根据各地农民觉悟程度、组织能力以及当地地方秩序、干部条件，采取分区分期完成土改的办法。但是单单今年冬天，就要进行一亿农村人口的土改。这一亿农村人口不是一个小数，现在除开中国以外，所有新民主主义国家的全部人口也只有一亿带零。要以短短一个冬天来解决与偌大一个人口生死有关的土改问题，这确不是一件容易的事。特别是在全国解放战争已经基本胜利之后来进行土改，我们要更有步骤有秩序地而且如此迅速地完成新区土改，自非更采取孤立地主减少阻力的办法不可。
    采取保存富农经济的政策，也可减少干部工作上的困难。尤其在划分阶级时，地主和富农不难划清；而富农和中农便有时会发生混淆，所以过去有把富裕中农划分为富农以致形成侵犯中农利益的事。采取了保存富农经济政策，便可减少这种偏差发生的可能。
    但是有少数贫雇农和少数工作干部，它们对这一政策，总有相当顾虑和怀疑。他们忧虑着：如此办法，是否能满足贫雇农的要求；旧式富农是否可不发生问题；同时他们怀疑现在既采取保存富农经济政策，是否过去分配富农多余土地财产的政策有错。这些顾虑和怀疑的所以发生，是因为它们没有把土改问题和今昔形势根本不同的问题相关联来考虑的原故。在过去实行土改时，当时人民解放军和国民党反动派正进行着生死斗争，胜负未分，争取战争胜利是当时全国人民的最高利益。一方面，人民解放战争要求农民出兵、出公粮、出义务劳动来支援前线；另方面，当时富农还不相信人民能够胜利，还是倾向于地主阶级和反动政权一边，反对土改和人民解放战争；因此我们必须允许农民征收富农的多余土地财产，以便多一些满足贫苦农民的要求，发动农民的高度革命热情，来参加和支援人民解放战争，打倒帝国主义所支持的国民党反动政权。这在当时，是完全必要和正确的。但在今日，人民解放战争已经基本胜利，反动派的最后肃清已经毫无疑问，农民的负担也已减轻了一些，农民因少得一部分土地而发生的困难，国家可以贷款方法来给以解决；所以今日新区的贫雇农已可不必要求去分取富农的多余土地财产。同时今日各民主阶级的革命大团结已经形成，富农的态度已有改变，只要人民政府实行保存富农经济的政策，可以争取富农中立。它土地的出租部分是否征收一部或全部可由它本区省以上的人民政府酌量情形决定；它雇用工人或借出钱谷的工资和利息条件可由它与雇工和借户分别协商解决；它出租多余土地，必须按照减租办法减租；它已不可能再像以前那样进行半封建性质的剥削。因此富农经济，是今日我们所必须保存的。
    富农经济的保存，不仅在实行土改时，和土改后的短时期内，有些必要；而且在今后长时期内，在整个新民主主义阶段内，也都如此。只有到了农村中可以普遍地采用机器耕种，组织集体农场，实行农村中的社会主义改造之时，富农经济才没有存在必要。可是这是要在相当长远的将来。
    今日放在我们面前的主要问题，除开争取人民解放战争的全面胜利以外，就是要争取人民经济的迅速恢复和发展。我们要消灭一切妨碍生产恢复和生产发展的阻力，所以我们必须迅速完成全国土改，这也是全国人民所迫切要求的。
