　　Eradicating Bureaucratic Work Styles in the Railway System
    The Evil Consequences of Bureaucracy in the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau
    Continuous Incidents at the Lianhuasi Quarry
    Waste of National Resources and Damage to Farmers' Crops
    [Our Newspaper, Xi'an] (Reporter Chen Ji) reports: Three incidents damaging the interests of the people have occurred consecutively at the Lianhuasi Quarry of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau: (1) serious waste of state property; (2) the complete preservation of the feudal foreman system; (3) destruction of farmers' crops. The main reason for these three major incidents is the serious bureaucratic work style of the responsible cadres of the bureau.

    Contractors Raise Unit Prices - Significant Losses for the Railway Bureau
    The Lianhuasi Quarry is located east of Huaxian County, Shaanxi, and is an important production site for ballast and rubble used along the Longhai Railway. Contractor Yin Yucheng, relying on feudal forces, mined ballast and rubble here, monopolizing the quarry and arbitrarily raising contract unit prices. After liberation, the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau did not investigate this situation, did not carefully assess the contractor's contract unit prices, and rashly contracted with Yin Yucheng for 14,000 cubic meters of rubble at a unit price of 28.1 jin of flour per cubic meter, which was 12.73 jin of flour more expensive than the unit price during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. The total price of 14,000 cubic meters of rubble would be 190,950 jin of flour more expensive. The responsible cadres of the bureau never raised any objections to such a high unit price and approved it casually. After the contract was signed, the engineering department of the bureau did not promptly urge the contractor to deliver the goods on time, allowing him to delay, so that the engineering needs could not be met in a timely manner. Before liberation, the contractor still owed the railway bureau thousands of cubic meters of ballast and rubble. The bureau did not care about this old debt and did not settle accounts with the contractor in a timely manner. To this day, the contractor has not yet paid off the old debt of ballast and rubble. Because the bureau did not carefully inspect the rubble and ballast mined by the contractor, most of the rubble and ballast did not meet the standards. When the bureau used the ballast, it was discovered that more than 1,600 cubic meters of ballast did not meet the specifications and could not be used. The bureau spent more than 6,600 jin of flour in wages to reprocess this unusable ballast. The contractor made the rubble but did not ship it on time; the railway bureau was in urgent need of rubble, so it had to send its own people to ship it. This freight cost several thousand jin of flour. The bureau took a careless attitude towards such losses and did not conduct strict inspections and investigations.

    Contractors Manage the Quarry - The Railway Bureau Suffers Further Losses
    Last December, the bureau, with the consent of the government, transferred the Lianhuasi Quarry to the bureau for management. The bureau sent an engineering team to take over. After receiving the order, the engineering team did not investigate the site situation, nor did it send a special person to the site to preside over the work. Instead, it designated contractor Li Derong and Zhao Jinsheng, the foreman of contractor Yang Yulin, to represent the bureau and lead the temporary workers who were repairing the Tong(guan)-Da(ying) section of the road to work at the site; and ordered Li and Zhao to be responsible for forming a management team to take charge of production tasks. The leaders and deputy leaders of this management team were Li and Zhao. The management team had fifteen large groups, and the leaders of the large groups were all foremen of the contractors. Each large group had seven people, including administrators, clerks, and cooks, all of whom were subordinates of the contractors. There were too many people in the management team, and more than ten of them did not engage in production. The responsible cadres of the bureau never raised any objections to this contractor-run organization, but allowed it to exist for two or three months. At that time, some cadres of the engineering team said happily: "Our organization has broken the exploitative system of contractors."

    Under the management of the contractor's foremen, the cost of rubble and ballast produced at the quarry was extremely high. The railway bureau suffered another loss. In more than two months, the quarry produced a total of 20,000 cubic meters of rubble and more than 24,000 cubic meters of ballast. The cost of each cubic meter of rubble was 1.776 jin of flour more expensive than the contractor's contracted unit price, and 20,000 cubic meters of rubble wasted more than 20,000 jin of flour; the cost of each cubic meter of ballast was also 2.276 jin of flour more expensive than the contractor's contracted unit price, and more than 24,000 cubic meters of ballast wasted 50,000 jin of flour. In addition, the quarry mined more than 1,000 cubic meters of ballast and rubble more than 400 meters away from the track, and this 1,000 cubic meters of ballast and rubble could not be transported out; if it were to be transported out, the shipping cost would almost be equal to the cost of mining another 1,000 cubic meters of rubble and ballast near the track. In the case of the bureau's extreme shortage of sleepers, the quarry used 8,800 sleepers to build houses, instead of using them for urgently needed projects. At that time, the bureau purchased new sleepers at a price of about 50,000 yuan per sleeper. How much money would 8,000 sleepers cost! Most of the materials used by the quarry were not recorded, and to this day, some of the materials are still unknown as to where they went. Because the management team was irresponsible, most of the rubble and ballast mined did not meet the standards. The rubble was too small and was discarded along the railway line in countless numbers. According to preliminary and inaccurate statistics, the amount of state property they wasted was worth about 700,000 jin of flour.

    Feudal Foreman System - Exploitation and Oppression of Workers
    During the period when the contractor ruled the management team, the bureau issued 3.5 jin of flour per day for the workers' food expenses, but after the contractor deducted it, the workers were simply unable to get enough to eat. Some foremen often stole the ballast and rubble mined by the workers at night. Sometimes, the foremen also deducted the workers' wages for no reason. Therefore, many workers worked for a month or two without getting a penny.

    On March 10 this year, the Materials Section of the bureau replaced the engineering team in taking over the Lianhuasi Quarry. They abolished the organization of the quarry's management team, but completely restored the contractor's exploitative system, and did not ask about the situation of the workers under the rule of the contractors. The contractors, relying on the power of the bureau, said to the workers: "The government recognizes the contract system as legal, and it is right for us to exploit you. If you continue to shout 'We get too little money,' I will fire you." The workers did not dare to speak, allowing them to exploit, oppress, and deceive them. The contractors did not pay wages to the workers, but said: "The bureau hasn't paid us yet!" In fact, they took the workers' wages to do speculative business, and sometimes even did the workers' business, earning the workers' money. They managed the workers' food, never disclosing the accounts, and the workers could not raise any objections. The bureau and the contractors signed a contract, but the contractors did not fulfill the contract, arbitrarily collecting tool fees and management fees from the workers, and deducting the workers' production quantity for no reason. The workers worked more than 16 hours a day, and the wages they received were extremely small. Some had to owe the contractors money after paying for food. The contract stipulated that workers should get 17 jin of flour for mining one cubic meter of ballast, but the workers could only get 3 or 4 jin of flour in reality. Some new workers did not even get one jin of flour. According to a recent survey, there are about 2,000 workers under the rule of the contractors, of which 361 do not have enough to eat, 234 have no clothes to wear, 26 have no shoes to wear, and 513 have not received wages (the wages have been taken by the contractors and their foremen). The Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau is not clear about such a cruel feudal exploitative system. They always think: "The contractors are afraid of us, how dare they mess around?" They still do not understand the real situation of the workers. Their thought of not caring about the interests of the workers and their bureaucratic work style of not understanding the situation have put a protective shield on the feudal foreman system, causing the workers' interests to suffer unparalleled damage.

    Contractors Bully People, Damaging Farmers' Crops
    Before and after the bureau took over the Lianhuasi Quarry, they never contacted the local county, district, or village governments, arbitrarily expanded the site, and casually occupied farmers' crop land. From the beginning of December last year to April this year, they destroyed 291.61 mu of farmers' crops, dug up 14 farmers' graves, and cut down 298 farmers' trees of all sizes. 73 households and 307 farmers were seriously damaged. Because the bureau relied on the contractors to manage the quarry, the management team headed by contractor Li Derong, in the name of the bureau, led the workers to mine rubble and ballast all over the mountains, arbitrarily destroying farmers' crops. They dug wherever they found ballast; and after digging up the crops, they said to the farmers: "This is what the government wants us to do." Sometimes they threw ballast into the crop fields. When the crop destruction incident occurred, the person in charge of the quarry still did not pay attention to it and ignored the local government's response. When Li Jingcheng, the village chief of Tantou Village, reported this matter to them, he was rebuked: "You don't assist the government in building the railway, but you only know how to care about the small interests of your village." The farmers wanted to see the crops that had been damaged, but they were ordered to stop by the foremen: "Don't come, we have a lot of tools here, who will we find if they are lost?" The farmers were so angry that they shed tears. Some contractors dug up graves without notifying the farmers and threw the corpses by the roadside. The farmers hated these things to the bone. They said: "If our crops are destroyed, what will we eat!" Some cursed: "The railway people are big bandits." Because the bureau did not deal with this incident in a timely manner, the relationship between the bureau and the masses deteriorated. Although the bureau recently sent people to the quarry to investigate, compensate the farmers for their crops, and apologize to the farmers, the political losses suffered by the bureau due to this incident are heartbreaking.

　　铲除铁路系统中的官僚主义作风
    西安铁路分局官僚主义的恶果
    莲花寺石场连续发生事件
    浪费国家资财毁坏农民青苗
    【本报西安讯】记者陈迹报道：西安铁路分局莲花寺石场连续发生了三件损害人民利益的事情：（一）严重地浪费国家财产；（二）原封不动地保存封建把头制度；（三）毁坏农民青苗。这三大事件发生的主要原因是该局负责干部在工作上存在着严重的官僚主义作风。
    包商抬高单价  路局损失重大
    莲花寺石场位于陕西华县之东，为陇海沿线所用石碴和片石的重要产地。该场场地属于国家，所设置的股道属于铁路局。包商殷钰成依靠封建势力，在此开采石碴和片石，垄断石场，任意抬高包工单价。解放后，西安铁路分局不调查这种情况，不详细考核包商的包工单价，轻率地向包商殷钰成包订了一万四千方片石，每方单价为二十八点一斤面粉，竟比国民党反动统治时代的单价贵十二点七三斤面粉。一万四千方片石的总价，就要贵十九万零九百五十斤面粉。该局负责干部对于这样高的单价，从未提出意见，随便批准了。包订以后，该局工务处又不随时催促该商按期交货，任其拖延，以致不能及时供应工程上的需要。该商在解放前尚积欠铁路局数千方石碴和片石。该局对于这笔旧账，毫不关心，未及时与该商清算，至今该商尚未还清这旧欠的石碴和片石。由于该局不认真检查该商所开采的片石和石碴，大多数片石和石碴不合标准。当该局使用石碴时，才发现一千六百多方石碴不合规格，不能使用。该局将这些不能用的石碴重新加工，就花了六千六百多斤面粉的工钱。该商打好片石，不按期装运；路局因急需片石，只好由自己派人装运。这笔运费，亦有好几千斤面粉。该局对于像这样的损失，采取马马虎虎的态度，未作严格的检查与追究。
    包商管理石场  路局再受损失
    去年十二月该局曾商得政府的同意，将莲花寺石场移给该局管理。该局派工程大队负责接管。该工程大队接到命令后，对现场情况，未作调查，亦不派专人赴该场主持工作，竟然指定包商李德荣和包商杨玉林的大工头赵金生，代表路局，率领当时在潼（关）大（营）段修路的临时工人，至该场工作；并命令李、赵两人负责组成管理组，掌握生产任务。这个管理组的正副组长即由李、赵两人担任。管理组下设十五大组，大组组长都是包商的工头。大组有管理员、事务员、伙夫等七人，都是包商的部下。管理组人员太多，其中不事生产的竟有十多人。该局负责干部对于这个包商包办的组织，从未提出异议，却让它存在了两三个月。当时工程大队的一些干部却兴高采烈地说：“我们这个组织，打破了包商的剥削制。”
    在包商工头对石场的管理下，石场出产的片石和石碴的成本极高。路局遂遭受又一次的损失。两个多月，该场共出产片石两万方，石碴二万四千余方，每方片石的成本比包商包的单价还要贵一点七七六斤面粉，两万方片石就要浪费两万多斤面粉；每方石碴成本亦比包商的单价贵二点二七六斤面粉，二万四千多方石碴，就要浪费五万斤面粉。此外，该场在距离股道四百公尺以外开采石碴和片石一千多方，这一千多方石碴和片石都运不出来；若要运出来，所花费的装运费几乎相等于股道附近另开采一千多方片石和石碴的工价。在该局枕木奇缺的情况下，该场以八千八百根枕木盖房子，却不用在急需的工程上。当时该局新购枕木，每根约价五万元。八千多根枕木，该花多少钱！该场平时所用的材料，大多没有记账，至今有些材料，还不知道用到那里去了。由于管理组不负责任，所开采的片石和石碴大多不合标准。片石过小了，抛在铁路沿线的，不计其数。根据初步的不准确的统计，他们浪费国家财产的数目，约值七十多万斤面粉。
    封建把头制度  剥削压榨工人
    在包商统治管理组时期，该局每天发给工人三斤半面粉的伙食费，被包商克扣后，工人就根本吃不饱。有些工头常在夜晚偷窃工人所开采的石碴和片石。有时，工头还无故扣除工人的工资。因此很多工人工作了一两个月，得不到一个钱。
    今年三月十日，该局材料科代替工程大队，接办莲花寺石场。他们取消该场管理组的组织，却完全恢复包商剥削制度，对于包商统治下的工人情形则不闻不问。包商借着路局的势力，向工人说：“公家承认包工制合法，我们剥削你们是应该的。如果你们再乱嚷‘钱拿得少’，老子就要开除你们。”工人们不敢讲话，任其剥削、压迫和欺骗。包商们不发工资给工人，却说：“路局还没发钱！”事实上他们拿工人的工资去做投机生意，有时甚至做工人的买卖，赚工人的钱。他们管理工人伙食，从不公开账目，工人不能提意见。路局和包商订了合同，包商不履行合同，任意征收工人工具费、管理费，无故克扣工人的生产数量。工人每天劳动十六小时以上，而所得的工资极其微小，有的把伙食费交了以后，还要倒欠包商的钱。合同规定工人打一方石碴得十七斤面粉，但工人实际只能得到三四斤面粉。有些新工人，还得不到一斤面粉。根据最近调查，在包商统治下的工人约有两千多人，其中吃不饱的有三百六十一人，没衣穿的有二百三十四人，没鞋穿的有二十六人，拿不到工资（工资都被包商及其工头领去了）的有五百一十三人。西安铁路分局对于这样残酷的封建剥削制度，知道得不清楚，他们总认为：“包商怕我们，还敢乱来吗？”对于工人的真实情形，至今还不了解。他们这种不关心工人利益的思想和不了解情况的官僚主义作风，替封建把头制度贴上了护身符，使工人利益遭受了无比的损害。
    包商仗势欺人  毁坏农民青苗
    该局接办莲花寺石场前后，都未曾与当地县、区、村政府取得联系，任意扩大场地，随便侵占农民青苗地。从去年十二月初至今年四月，先后毁坏农民青苗二百九十一点六一亩，挖坏农民坟墓十四座，砍掉农民的大小树木二百九十八株。七十三户、三百零七个农民受到严重的损害。由于该局依靠包商管理石场，以包商李德容为首的管理组遂以路局的名义，率领工人漫山遍野地开采片石和石碴，对于农民青苗，任意毁坏。他们发现那里有石碴，就到那里乱挖；挖了青苗，还对农民说：“这是公家要这样干的。”有时他们把石碴丢进青苗田里。当毁坏青苗事件发生以后，该场负责人仍然不重视此事，对于当地政府的反映置之不理。潭头村村长李精诚向他们反映这件事时，反被他们训了一顿：“你们不协助政府办铁路，却只晓得斤斤记挂你们村里的一点点小利益。”农民们要想看看他们被损毁的青苗，也被工头们喝令止步：“不要来，我们这儿有很多工具，丢了找谁？”农民们气愤得流泪，有些包工头不通知农民挖了坟墓，将尸首抛在路旁。农民们对于这些事情，无不恨之入骨。他们说：“毁了咱的青苗，咱没吃的哪！”有的骂道：“铁路人是大土匪。”由于该局不及时处理这一事件，路局与群众的关系益形恶化。最近该局虽派人赴该场调查，赔偿农民青苗，并向农民道歉，但路局因这一事件所遭受的政治损失，是令人痛心的。
