To the Editor:

I am Li Jinghua from Manziying Village, Fourth District, Xiong County. My family's class status is middle peasant. My eldest son, Li Haiming, works at the Anshan Iron and Steel Factory. My second son, Li Yanming, farms at home. My third son, Li Youming, is a soldier in the 19th Army Corps Garrison Headquarters. After the People's Liberation Army arrived, the village chief asked us for a quilt. When I asked him to return it, the village chief, deputy village chief, and head of the farmers' association ignored me. I went to the district government to negotiate. The district head kicked me to the ground, nearly killing me. He also stripped me of my clothes in December and left me freezing for half a day. I appealed to the county people's court, but President Guo kept the letter and ignored me. The higher authorities only transferred him to another place to settle the matter. The newly arrived Comrade Li Jie said to me, "It's too late to deal with this matter!" Please, editor, help me resolve this issue.

Li Jinghua, April 10th

Editor's Note: After receiving Li Jinghua's letter, we immediately sent a letter to the Xiong County government to investigate the facts. Below is the reply from the Xiong County People's Government:

To the Editor:

Upon receiving your letter, our county sent personnel to investigate and understand the facts, which are as follows:

In July of last year, the village chief of Manziying Village, Fourth District, convened a meeting of families of military martyrs and dependents to hear their opinions on village cadres (which was correct). At that time, military dependent Li Jinghua raised concerns about the village chief, saying that Village Chief Yu Shoushu had engaged in corruption. Village Chief Yu Shoushu, together with his brother and son, beat Li Jinghua. Afterward, instead of reflecting on his mistakes, he harbored resentment towards Li Jinghua and repeatedly made false reports to the district office, speaking ill of Li. The district cadres' work was not thorough, and they believed it to be true without investigating the facts. After the autumn grain collection ended and land reform had just begun, because Li Jinghua owed more than one stone of public grain, the village chief used his position for personal gain and insisted that Li Jinghua immediately hand over the public grain. When the Li family could not hand it over immediately, the village chief detained Li Jinghua, stripped him of his clothes, and left him freezing for half a day. In the afternoon, he sent him to the district government for processing. At that time, District Head Wang Sili was lying on the kang in the secretary's office. After Li Jinghua entered the room, an assistant asked him, "Why haven't you handed over the public grain?" Li Jinghua said, "Because the village cadres are all corrupt, I am unwilling to hand over the public grain to them. I want to hand it over to the state." The assistant then asked, "Why not hand it over to the district either?" He said, "The district cadres and village cadres are all in cahoots, protecting each other. I plan to hand it over to the county government!" At this time, the district head became furious and kicked Li Jinghua. Because he was old (over sixty years old), he immediately fell to the ground. Later, someone helped him up. The district secretary explained it to him, and then let him go back.

Based on the above situation, we have taken the following actions:

1.  Yu Shoushu, the village chief of Manziying Village, is dismissed from his post for corruption and beating people in the village. The two stones of corn he embezzled are recovered. He is also ordered to make a self-criticism at a mass meeting and apologize to everyone.

2.  District Head Wang Sili, for not going deep among the masses in his leadership and randomly beating people, violated the policy of protecting human rights. In addition to ordering him to make a profound self-criticism, he is given criticism and education and ordered to apologize to Li Jinghua in person.

　　雄县四区区长王思礼无理殴打军属李景华
    董一林县长报告处理结果
    编者同志：
    我是雄县四区蛮子营村人，成份是中农。我的大儿李海明在鞍山铁工厂做工。二儿李彦明在家种地。三儿李有明在十九兵团警备司令部当战士。人民解放军到来以后，村长曾向我们要了一条被子。我向他要回时，村长、村副、农会主任置之不理。我到区政府交涉。区长一脚把我踢倒在地上，踢得我半死半活。他又在十二月天剥下了我身上的衣服，把我冻了半日。我向县人民法院上诉，郭院长却把信收起来，没有理我。上级也只把他调到别的地方了事。新来的李杰同志对我说：“这事晚了，不好处理！”请编者给我解决这个问题吧。
            李景华  四月十日
    编者按：我们接到李景华来信之后，即致函雄县县政府调查实情。下面是雄县人民政府的复信：编者同志：
    前接贵社来信一件，经我县派员调查了解，其事实经过如下：
    去年七月间四区蛮子村村长召开军工烈属会，听取他们对村干的意见（这是对的）。当时军属李景华给村长提意见，说村长于寿书有贪污行为。村长于寿书会同他的弟弟和儿子将李景华殴打一顿。事后不但不检讨自己的错误，反而与李景华作仇，曾几次向区公所作假报告，说李的坏话。区干部工作也不深入，对事实不加调查，就信以为真。去年秋征结束、土地改革刚开始时，因李景华尾欠公粮一石多，村长即假公济私，硬要李景华马上交出公粮。李家一时交不出来，村长即将李景华扣押起来，并将他的衣服剥去，把他冻了半天，下午将他送区政府处理。当时区长王思礼在秘书室内的炕上躺着。李景华进屋后，一个助理员问他：“你为什么不交公粮呢”？李景华说：“因村干尽贪污、我不愿把公粮交给他们。我是交给国家的。”这个助理员又问：“怎么也不交到区里呢？”他说：“区干部和村干部是一体，都是官官相卫，我准备交到县政府去！”这时区长便大发雷霆，踢了李景华一脚。他因年岁大（有六十余岁），一下就跌倒在地上了。后来有人将他扶起。区书对他解释一下，就放他回去了。
    我们根据上述情况，已作了如下处理：
    一、蛮子营村长于寿书，在村中贪污打人，给予撤职处分。追出贪污去的二石玉米。并令其在群众大会上进行自我坦白，向大家道歉。
    二、区长王思礼，在领导上不深入群众，随便打人，违犯保障人权政策。除令其作深刻检讨外，并给予批评教育，令其向李景华当面道歉。
              县长董一林
