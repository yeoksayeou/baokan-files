　　Communist Party Members and Mercury Rectifiers
    Pan Tao
    Eight months ago, when the Dalian Transportation Company proposed the specialized responsibility system, it had to readjust its personnel to fix them in place afterward, instead of changing shifts every few days. At that time, the workers didn't like going to the Cultural Substation, saying, "Whoever goes to the Cultural Substation is unlucky; not to mention getting an accident-free bonus, it would be good enough not to have repair fees deducted from their wages." What was the reason for this? Han Wende told others, "I was scared by the Cultural Substation! One day I was sitting in the room when, 'Boom!' There was a burst of light, and a machine blew its lid! Then 'Boom!' 'Boom!' two more times. My goodness! This happened three times in one day. To be honest, I was really scared!" This was indeed the case. In the past, there were at least two or three faults a month, and at worst, the lid would blow off. One repair cost tens of thousands of yuan, and electricity had to be stopped for twenty or thirty days. When the winter climate changed, faults seemed to occur constantly with a pattern. So, no one was happy to be assigned there.
    After repeated discussions, the Party finally decided to transfer five Party member workers, including Sun Yousheng, and replace the other workers. The branch committee told them, "There are difficulties, but the work cannot be stopped, and the electricity cannot be cut off, because the Cultural Substation is related to the operation of the entire Dalian tram system. If others can't do it, we can switch them around; you five are all Party members. Communist Party members are most afraid of difficulties, and you must achieve results to show others."
    The arduous task was placed on the shoulders of the five Party members, and difficulties were densely spread before them like a net. Faults today, faults tomorrow... How could they not be anxious?! Because of this, they changed their sleeping hours. Two people stayed up until 2:00 AM, and got up at 5:00 AM, while two people took turns sleeping during the day. Sun Yousheng was on the day shift and served as the director of the substation. He personally checked the machines every day, and personally helped repair them when they broke down. In order not to interfere with the power supply during the day, they often repaired machines until 2:00 or 3:00 AM at night. Once, a water pump malfunctioned and couldn't pump water. They repaired it until 2:00 AM so that power could be supplied normally the next day, and the machine was not damaged (if the time is too long and the incoming water is too cold, the machine is prone to failure). Even so, it still didn't stop the occurrence of faults, making them begin to doubt their own strength: the machines are too bad, and can't be bought! There are domestic products in the parts, and I don't even know which is from which country, how can faults not occur? But the voice of the branch committee member immediately appeared in their minds: "There are difficulties, the work cannot be stopped, and the electricity cannot be cut off... you five are all Party members..." This sentence seemed to inject new blood into them again, increasing their strength. They thought: We must complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the people. So, they re-stipulated the shift system, strengthened inspections, and didn't even take holidays on Sundays. Whenever a fault occurred, they carefully studied the cause; life group meetings and temporary forums all treated it as a central issue to study. But they couldn't find a clue for a long time, making them deeply feel: It's not enough to just work hard, we must use both our hands and brains. During the Japanese occupation, Chinese people couldn't get into substations and didn't have the opportunity to learn technology; in the past two or three years, everyone has been groping around; now, if we don't work harder to learn technology, it will be difficult to overcome the difficulties. So, they began to pay attention to how to improve operational knowledge and how to improve technical principles, trying their best to read business books every day, and using theory to analyze the causes of machine faults.
    At a group meeting, Sun Yousheng proposed: To reduce faults, we must control the temperature. Because when the mercury and anode in the substation rectifier come into contact, sparks will occur, which will cause the temperature of the iron tank (machine body) to rise, which requires condensation. This excessively cold water will be stimulated due to the excessively high temperature of the machine body, which is prone to faults. Everyone felt that this suggestion was reasonable, and they worked towards the goal of adjusting the temperature.
    They sealed the window seams, installed a large electric stove in the room, and increased the indoor temperature. But the temperature still couldn't be maintained, and faults still occurred. It really stumped them! They couldn't sit still, couldn't sleep, lying in bed at night, you looked at me, I looked at you, turning over and over, everyone was thinking in their hearts: How can we increase the temperature further?
    Sun Yousheng thought that the temperature could be added to the cooling water. But how to add this temperature? If you boil water, the temperature may not be correct. Finally, he thought that it would be possible to add an electric stove in the water tank. Thinking of this, it was like opening a window in a dark room and seeing a glimmer of light! He immediately brought it up for everyone to study. But in the end, everyone felt that the cooling water was circulating water, and after passing around the machine body, the cooling water itself had a hundred volts, and if you add an electric stove that is one hundred and ten volts, would it be too high? In the end, everyone's opinion was to test it the next day.
    It was going to be done tomorrow, and they couldn't sleep at night. Their minds were always turning around with "Can it be done?" "Can't it be done?" The sound of faults and the shooting sparks reappeared in front of their eyes. The hearts of the five people were burning like fire, and they couldn't lie down!
    When the east faintly revealed the color of fish belly, they—the five Party members of the Cultural Substation—were tightly gathered together, and had already begun to study how to heat up. Suddenly, one of them shouted, "Damn it! The water is direct current, and the electric stove is alternating current, they have no relationship with each other." This was Sun Yousheng, his shout aroused a burst of laughter from everyone. Their hearts were like angry flowers that had opened, and their greasy faces showed smiles.
    The temperature was maintained! It was always between eighteen and twenty-two degrees, the machine was not stimulated, and faults were reduced. But they further considered another question: If the electric stove in the mercury rectifier's cylinder breaks, everyone will not know, which is also very important, because the electric stove is used to evaporate mercury. After the mercury evaporates, it falls down after condensation. This way, air and gas can be discharged; if it breaks, it cannot evaporate, and it is prone to faults. But you can't see it if it breaks in the iron barrel, and in the past you just felt it to see if it was hot, and it would be bad if you were careless for a while. How can you know as soon as the electric stove breaks or is about to break? They studied it sleeplessly again.
    Their painstaking research finally yielded new dividends. They used wire to make a coil, which can generate magnetism when current passes through it to attract a wire. If the electric stove breaks, this wire will fall off, and at this time the light will also turn on and the bell will ring, so the workers can immediately detect it and conduct an inspection. Due to their improved operating methods, they created a new record of no faults for eight months so far.
    When they had no faults for three months, their experience was promoted to various substations. The other substations also had no faults for three months. The workers often said together, "I really didn't expect the Cultural Substation to create such great results! In the past, there were up to three faults a day, and now there have been none for six months. It's really a rare thing!" The five workers at the Cultural Substation immediately replied to them, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as you study hard, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome." Comrade Jia Suping, the secretary of the Party branch, often said to them, "Don't be proud! Continue to study and create greater results." They all believe that listening to the Party is never wrong! They said that our achievements are the encouragement given to us by the Party, and the strength given to us by the Party. They have once again put forward the slogan: "Guarantee to extend the machines that should be repaired in February to the 'May 1st' Labor Day."
    They didn't just talk empty words. By "May 1st," by the end of May, there had not been a single fault.

　　共产党员和水银整流器
    潘淘
    八个月前，大连交通公司在提出专责制的时候，要重新调整一次人员，好在以后固定起来，不再三天两日换班。当时，工友们都不爱到文化变电所去，说：“谁到文化变电所算是倒了霉，不用说拿无事故奖金，不从工资中扣除补修费就算不错。”这是什么原因呢？韩文德告诉别人说：“我算是叫文化变电所治熊啦！有一天我正在屋里坐着，‘轰！’的一声，火光四射，一台机器大揭盖了！接着‘轰！’‘轰！’又是两下子，我的妈呀！这一天就是三次，说句良心话，我真怕！”事实也是如此，过去一个月故障最少也要两三次，厉害了就要揭盖。一次的补修费就得几万元的经费，还得二、三十天停止送电。冬季气候一变化，故障好像有规律性一样的不断发生。所以分配谁，谁也不高兴去。
    党经过了反复讨论，最后决定把孙友盛等五个党员工友调去，把另外几个工友换回来，支委并对他们说：“困难是有的，但是工作不能不做，电更不能不送，因为文化变电所是关系着整个大连市的电车行驶。别人干不了，可以调换调换；你们五个都是党员，共产党员是最不怕困难的，一定要做出成绩来给别人看看。”
    艰巨的任务放在五个党员的肩上，困难像网似的密布在他们面前，今天故障，明天故障，……这怎么能叫他们不着急呢？！为了这个，他们把睡觉的时间都改了，晚上两人看到下半夜二点，睡到早上五点就起床，白天两人再轮换睡。孙友盛是日班，担任变电所的主任。他每天都是亲自检点机器，机器坏了，便亲自帮助补修。他们为了不妨碍白天的送电，晚上补修机器常常到两三点。有一次抽水机发生故障，抽不出水来，直修到晚上下两点，使第二天能照常送电，机器也没受损失（如时间过长，来水过凉，机器即容易发生故障）。虽然这样，也仍挡不住故障的发生。使他们对自己的力量开始怀疑起来：机器太坏啦，买又买不到！里面的零件那国货都有，还不知道那个是那国的货，故障那能不发生？但是他们脑子里立即出现了支部委员的声音：“困难是有的，工作不能不做，电更不能不送……你们五个都是党员……。”这句话又似重新给他们注入了新的血液，增长了他们的力量。他们想：党、人民交给我们的任务，一定要完成。于是重新规定了交班制度，加强了检查，星期也不休假。每当发生故障的时候，他们就仔细研究原因；生活小组会、临时座谈会，都把它当做中心问题来研究。但是很长时间得不到头绪，使他们深深的感觉到：光苦干也不行，还要手脑并进。日寇统治时期中国人捞不着进变电所，没有机会学技术；这二、三年来大家都是在摸索着干；现在要不加劲学技术，困难很难克服。于是他们就开始注意怎样提高操作知识，怎样提高技术原理，每天尽力看业务书籍，用理论来分析机器故障的原因。
    在一个小组会上，孙友盛提出：要减少故障一定要掌握住温度。因为变电整流器内的水银和阳极发生接触的时候要出火花，这样铁槽（机体）的温度上升，就需要冷凝，这种过于冷的水因为机体温度过高就要受刺激，也就容易发生故障。大家觉得这个意见很合理，就向着调整温度的目标去努力。
    他们把窗户缝糊死，屋里按上个大电炉子，增加了室内温度。可是温度还是保持不住，故障仍是发生。真把他们难坏了！坐也坐不住，睡也睡不着，晚间躺在被窝里，你望望我，我望望你，翻过来，覆过去，个个心里直琢磨：再怎样增加温度呢？
    孙友盛想到在冷凝水里是可以加温度的。可是这个温度怎么加呢？要是烧水温度也不一定正确。最后他想在水槽里按上个电炉子是可以加温的。想到这里，好像暗室打开一扇窗，见到一丝光亮一样乐！当时就提出来和大家研究。但最后大家觉得冷凝水是循环水，绕过机体后，冷凝水本身就有一百电压，再加上电炉子是一百一电压，是否会高呢？最后大家的意见是等第二天试验一下看。
    明天就要做了，夜里他们怎么也睡不着，脑子里老是“能成？”“不能成？”的打转转。发生故障的声音、四射的火花又在眼前显现出来。五个人的心里像火烧，躺也躺不下去了！
    当东方微露鱼肚皮色的时候，他们——文化变电所的五个党员紧紧地围在一起，早已开始研究怎样加温了。突然其中一个喊道：“他妈的！水里的是直流电，电炉子是交流电，它两不发生关系。”这是孙友盛，他的喊声引起大家的一片欢笑，心像开放了的怒花，油糊糊地脸上显出了微笑。
    温度保持住了！老是在十八度到二十二度上下，机器不受刺激，故障减少了。但是他们进一步考虑着另外一个问题：水银整流器唧筒里的电炉子有时间断了大家也不知道，这也是很重要的，因为电炉子是蒸发水银用的，水银蒸发后，经过冷凝掉下来，这样，就可以把空气、瓦斯体排泄出去；如断了就不能蒸发，容易出故障。但在铁桶里断了又看不见，过去只是摸摸热不热，一时马虎就糟了。怎么能使电炉子刚断或要断时就能知道呢？他们又不眠不休地研究着。
    他们的苦心研究终于换来了新的代价。他们用线作出个线包，通过电流时可以发生磁性吸住一根电线，电炉子一断这根电线就要掉下来，这时电灯也亮，铃也响，工友们便可以马上发觉进行检查。由于他们改良了操作办法，创出至今八个月没出丝毫故障的新纪录。
    当他们三个月没出故障的时候，他们的经验就被推广到各个变电所里去。别的变电所也同样的三个月没出丝毫故障。工友们凑到一块常常这样讲：“真没想到文化变电所能创造出这样大的成绩！过去最多一天三次故障，现在六个月也没出，真是个稀奇事！”文化变电所的五名工友立即答复他们：“在共产党的领导下，只要苦心钻研，没有克服不了的困难。”党总支书记贾素萍同志常常对他们说：“不能骄傲！要继续钻研，创造出更大的成绩。”他们都相信，听党的话没有错！他们说，我们的成绩是党给我们的鼓舞，是党给我们的力量。他们又重新提出了口号：“保证把二月应补修的机器延长到‘五一’劳动节。”
    他们没有说空话，到“五一”，到五月底，再也没有出过一次故障。
