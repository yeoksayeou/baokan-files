    "The Fire at Huangsongling"
    Su Jian (painting), Ma Xun (poem)

    (8) The director, impatient to listen, slammed the table and glared: "The most important thing is to float the timber downstream. This month, we have to deliver two million cubic meters of logs! Who will take responsibility if the task isn't completed? Fire prevention is not a big deal. Just send two or three people to cut a firebreak, make it look decent!" Section Chief Li, with his shallow revolutionary cultivation, bent his back upon seeing the director's angry face: "Yes, yes, I'll do as you say!"

    (9) What kind of firebreak can three people make? No wonder Old Zhao and the workers are anxiously arguing! Everyone says it’s unreliable. They asked the director to send more people, but the director still said the same thing: "Don't argue with me, I've made my decision: three people will go to cut the firebreak, not one more!"

    (10) Yan Guaitou (Strange Head) excitedly volunteered, "When it comes to fire prevention, I have good ideas!" Zhao Jinglin was worried when he saw him: "I'll go cut the firebreak too!" The section chief sent one more person, and the three of them went off together. The rest of the workers were in low spirits and couldn't help complaining: "Not accepting the opinions of the masses, this work style is really terrible." Everyone headed towards the log-floating area, while the director kept shouting from behind: "Those who are floating the logs downstream must work harder, there will be rewards for completing the task!"

    (11) The three arrived at the log yard and started cutting grass together. There were so few people, which made Old Zhao anxious: he lowered his head and worked hard, ignoring his fatigue! Yan Guaitou had barely cut a few strokes before sitting on a stack of wood, first stretching himself and then lighting a cigarette. His triangular eyes narrowed, and a plan formed in his mind, he called out to Old Zhao: "Hey, hey, listen to me, stop cutting, you'll offend the 'Old Batou' (the mountain forest god in feudal legends),
    our lives will be in danger! Besides, we've already cut a lot..." (Attached picture)

    “黄松岭的火灾”
    苏坚画  马寻诗
    （八）所长一听不耐烦，敲起桌子又瞪眼：“第一件大事是放洋，本月要把二百万立方原木送到；完不成任务，你负责？防火有什么大不得了。派两三个人割个防火道，看得过去就算了！”李股长，革命修养浅；一见所长翻了脸，不觉把腰弯：“是是是，我照办！”
    （九）三个人能修啥防火道？不怪老赵和工友急得直吵！都说不保靠。要求所长多派人，所长还是老一套：“你们不要吵我做决定了：三个人去修防火道，多一个也不要！”
    （十）阎怪头兴高彩烈的来报名，“要讲防火啊，咱办法高！”赵景林一见不放心：“咱也去修防火道！”股长再派上一个人三个人便一同走开了。其余的工友情绪不高忍不住发牢骚：“不接受群众意见，这种作风真糟糕。”大家伙走向流送场，所长直在后边嚷：“放洋的人可得加劲儿干，完成任务有奖赏！”
    （十一）三人来到楞场，一齐动手割草；人手少，急坏了老赵：低头猛干，不顾疲劳！阎怪头割不上几刀坐在木垛上，先伸伸懒腰再把烟卷点着。三稜眼一瞇，计上心壳，开口叫老赵：“喂喂，听我话别在割了，冒犯了‘老把头’，
    （封建传说的山林神）咱们的命难保！再说，咱们已经割了不少……”（附图片）
