Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation has recently received sixty-three letters from Soviet women to Chinese women, forwarded by the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee. The letters express an ardent hope that Chinese women will correspond with them and become friends. The senders are Soviet women in various positions.

The senders expressed their greatest joy and concern for the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the heroic struggle of the Chinese people and women, and their achievements in participating in production and construction. Fanya, a female worker at the Moscow Textile Factory, wrote in her letter: "The heroic struggle of the Chinese people has won the greatest admiration. Your victory has aroused sincere joy throughout the Soviet Union." Irina Ikurova, a female teacher, wrote: "The Soviet people are watching everything that happens in your country with love and concern. We believe that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is extremely important. This means the growth of the strength of the democratic and socialist camp."

Every letter introduced the happy and joyful life of Soviet women today. Everyone who wrote a letter enthusiastically hoped to correspond with Chinese women and become friends.

In order to thank the Soviet sisters for their enthusiasm and concern, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation proposed to women in various work positions across the country to voluntarily write replies to them. The replies can be forwarded by the National Democratic Women's Federation before the end of July. The All-China Women's Federation has printed a single page with the names and positions of all Soviet letter writers, which can be obtained directly from the International Department of the Federation.
