　　The Ox Belonging to the Middle Peasant Should Be Returned - Hoping that the Wu'an County Government Will Promptly Investigate and Handle This
Comrade Editor:
    I have a problem that I request the Party newspaper to help resolve. I am Hu Lingzhi, from Zhao Dian Village, Fourth District, Wu'an, Hebei, and my class status is lower-middle peasant. In 1946 (before the land reform), one of my family's oxen was taken by my maternal uncle for his use and was never returned. My uncle's family lives in Yangtun, which is also in my district. His name is Yang Jiuchang, and his class status is well-to-do middle peasant. He was wrongly struggled against during the land reform, and my family's ox was also confiscated. During the rectification of errors, the village returned all the wrongly confiscated land and furniture to my uncle's family, but my family's ox was not returned. My father went to Yangtun three times to ask the village chief, Yang Jiulai, for it. The village chief said, "Go back first, we will discuss it, and we will give it to you sooner or later." Afterwards, he kept saying that they had not discussed it well yet, so my family's ox was never returned. In April 1949, when I returned home and learned that this matter had not been resolved, I went to the district to find the district chief. The district chief also said that the ox would be returned to my family sooner or later and wrote me a letter to find the Yangtun worker to resolve it. I took the letter to Yangtun. The worker said, "This problem has been going on for more than two years, and the ox has already been distributed to the masses, so it may be difficult to resolve." He told me to go back first and wait for a reply. Because I was eager to return to the army, I could not wait any longer. Therefore, the problem has been dragged on until now and has not been resolved. This May, I returned home again and learned that my family's ox had been sold by Yang Jiulai, the village chief of Yangtun, to a farmer in my village for 1,200 catties of rice. Because I only had ten days of leave, I could not stay at home for long, so I returned to the army. I hope that the newspaper can publish this letter and help resolve this problem.

### 没收中农的牛应该退还  望武安县府迅速调查处理

　　没收中农的牛应该退还  望武安县府迅速调查处理编者同志：
    我有一个问题，要求党报设法解决。我是河北武安四区赵店村人，成份是下中农，名叫胡玲芝。在一九四六年（土地改革以前），我家的一头牛被我舅父牵去使用，没有送回。舅家也在我区杨屯住，名叫杨久长，成份是富裕中农。他在土地改革时被错斗了，我家的牛也被没收去了。在纠偏时，村里即将错误没收了我舅舅家的土地家具全部退回，惟有我家的牛没有退还。我父亲到杨屯找村长杨九来要过三次，该村长说：“你先回去，我们讨论一下，早晚会给你的。”以后又推说他们还没有讨论好，因此始终未将我家的牛退回。一九四九年四月，我回家知道这件事还未解决，就到区里找区长。区长也说这牛迟早要归还我家的，并给我写了一封信，让我去找杨屯工作员解决。我拿着信到了杨屯。工作员说：“这问题已经二年多了，牛也分给群众了，恐怕不好解决。”并叫我先回去听候答复。我因急于返回部队，不能久等。因此问题一直拖到现在仍未解决。今年五月间我又回家，知道我家的牛已经被杨屯村长杨九来以一千二百斤米的代价卖给我村的一个农民了。因我只请假十天，不能在家多住，又回到部队。我希望报纸能将这封信发表，并帮助解决这个问题。
