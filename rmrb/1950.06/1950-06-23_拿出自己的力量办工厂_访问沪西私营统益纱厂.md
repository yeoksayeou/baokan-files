　　Running a Factory with Our Own Strength
    Visiting the Private Tongyi Cotton Mill in Western Shanghai
    Special Correspondent Lin Wei
    Poor sales, tight capital turnover, insufficient raw materials, and shrinking production have been common difficulties encountered by private textile enterprises in Shanghai since March. However, the extent of these difficulties varies greatly from factory to factory. Some factories cannot survive without state support and are destined to collapse (fourteen yarn factories have already closed down). Others, while facing difficulties, can still sustain themselves and weather the temporary difficulties of the national economic reorganization. If the state provides the same level of support, the former type of factory can barely avoid collapse, while the latter can move forward rapidly. The private Tongyi Cotton Mill in the western district of Shanghai is a representative of the latter type.
  Sustaining Production Through Self-Reliance
    Tongyi Cotton Mill was founded in 1920. It currently has over 63,000 spindles, over 300 power looms, and approximately 2,800 employees. It is one of the larger and better-equipped of the 54 yarn factories currently in Shanghai. According to the mill's manager, Dong Chunfang, and factory director, He Zhiguang, the mill has experienced two major devastations in the 30 years since its establishment. The first was during the Japanese military administration in 1941, when 30,000 dan of raw cotton, over 1,400 pieces of cotton yarn, 45,000 bolts of cotton cloth, all the machinery repair equipment, and many other assets were looted. The second was the looting by Chiang Kai-shek's gang through the August 19th price controls in 1948, as well as the largest public debt appropriation on the eve of the price controls (the mill alone contributed over 300,000 US dollars). Since liberation, problems such as transportation, raw cotton procurement, and product sales have not been resolved immediately due to the unfinished war and the underdeveloped rural productivity and purchasing power. In addition, the high price of cotton and low price of yarn, coupled with the disruption of electricity supply after the bandit aircraft bombings, have made it consistently difficult to maintain production. However, to date, the mill has no external debts and has not applied for any loans from the government. Except for a few special circumstances, they have almost never borrowed from anyone. Nevertheless, machinery and supplies are constantly being replenished, and raw cotton is continuously being restocked, regularly maintaining a two-month supply. Currently, only nine of the 54 yarn factories in Shanghai can sustain themselves, and Tongyi is one of them (recently, due to the difficulty of procuring raw cotton, they also want to apply for some commissioned spinning).
    "We don't have any special skills," explained Manager Dong. "We are just down-to-earth, diligent, not adventurous, not opportunistic, and not deceptive. When business was good, we didn't expand as quickly as other companies, which may have seemed a bit conservative; but when business is bad, we don't suffer as much." In addition to this explanation, Factory Director He added two concise statements: "We rely entirely on our own strength to run the factory and operate the factory according to industrial principles."
  Proper Management, Production First
    During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, many factories in Shanghai completely deviated from the normal industrial track. They colluded with bureaucratic compradors, used low-interest loans, official exchange rates, and allocated materials to make a fortune; they seized huge profits through stock speculation, gold and silver speculation, and short selling. Some used high-interest loans to speculate in essential goods for people's livelihoods. The factories themselves were extremely corrupt and did not pay attention to reform. After liberation, they continued their old practices, taking advantage of the temporary instability of prices. As a result, when prices stabilized and the whole country cheered, they, along with speculative merchants, fell into serious difficulties and even stopped production and closed down. Only factories that were properly managed, improved production management, or had little involvement with speculation faced lighter difficulties and were able to maintain production. Tongyi Cotton Mill is one such factory that has been properly managed, and therefore faces less difficulty. They have never sold empty warehouse receipts without goods or with insufficient goods, and they have never borrowed debt that they were not confident of repaying to speculate. They have always adhered to the principles of industry first and production first. The number of staff in the factory accounts for only 3.6% of the number of workers, which is less than half the proportion of staff in general yarn factories (the total number of staff in the 54 yarn factories in Shanghai accounts for 8% of the total number of workers). Their principle of employing people is to have skills and abilities. There are no redundant staff in the factory who are paid but do nothing, relying on connections for their jobs, and there are no factional conflicts. When deciding to adopt, change, or abolish certain systems or methods, they pay more attention to consulting with staff and workers. Recently, they are also preparing to gradually disclose business conditions and accounts. They also strive to do a better job in employee welfare such as nurseries, medical rooms, and night schools (learning culture and technology). The doctors, medicine, and teachers in the factory are all provided by the company. As a result, labor-management relations have always been relatively normal, and no major disputes have occurred. The company's thinking is: "If labor-management relations are not good, production cannot be carried out." According to several workers elected as trade union committee members, because the company is willing to put its efforts into management, does not delay wages, and does not neglect welfare, the production enthusiasm of all workers in the factory has been rising and stable since liberation. Now they are working hard to improve labor efficiency, reduce raw material waste, and assist the company in reducing costs and increasing production.
  Higher Quality, Good Sales
    At the same time, the factory has always paid great attention to maintaining the superior quality of its products. In the past, their Caihua Die (Colorful Butterfly) brand yarn and cloth and Mao Die (Cat Butterfly) brand yarn have always been well-known, sold far and wide, and able to sell at higher prices. After liberation, because the market and the vast countryside greatly welcomed 20-count yarn, 42-count yarn, and 12-pound fine cloth, they changed their focus to producing these yarns and cloths, so sales were better. However, according to Factory Director He, the quality of their products is now worse than before. The reason is that there is insufficient raw cotton, making it impossible to select it carefully. Moreover, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company uniformly follows the listed prices when purchasing.
  Optimistic about the Future, Full of Confidence
    They are optimistic and confident about the future of their factory and the entire Chinese industry. They believe that the policy of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party to allow the existence and development of private capitalist economy for a considerable period of time is completely genuine and beyond doubt. Based on this understanding, they have gradually transferred funds that escaped to Hong Kong before liberation back to the mainland, actively overcome difficulties, and maintain production.
    They believe that the People's Government is "sincerely intending to develop industry" and "everything is considered from the perspective of the entire industrial future." They said: "For example, since the government advocated labor-management consultation, both sides can be open and honest with each other on major and minor matters in the factory and resolve them reasonably. This is the most important condition for developing industry, making everyone generally confident about the future." Especially after the East China Textile Conference in May, according to Factory Director He, "The general yarn factory colleagues have seen that the government is genuinely trying to help everyone overcome difficulties, being realistic and not perfunctory at all. It helps everyone start production by subsidizing 46 jin of cotton for every piece of yarn, and even subsidizes more money to purchase cotton abroad. It can even conduct self-criticism for any inadequate consideration. This was unimaginable in the Kuomintang era."
    Regarding the current specific difficulties, they believe in Chairman Mao's instructions: "There are difficulties, there are solutions, and there is hope." They believe that after the liberation of Taiwan, the blockade will definitely be completely broken. They also believe that after land reform and the development of agriculture, the raw material and sales problems of yarn factories will definitely be solved. They are very interested in the expansion of cotton fields in northern Jiangsu and other places. They hope that yarn factory colleagues will "take action in accordance with the government's instructions, put out all their own efforts to maintain production and improve the management of production and operation; do not sit and wait; do not have the idea of 'using it all up and then asking the government for help'; and do not hold the negative attitude of 'not using it all up cannot gain the understanding of the workers'."
    "According to the needs of the 470 million people, the existing spindles in the country are absolutely insufficient. However, if we want to expand in the future, we will definitely not expand in Shanghai; we will go to cotton-producing areas along the Xi'an or Beijing-Hankou railway line to build new factories," Factory Director He frankly and happily expressed his hope.
  Reduce Waste, Improve Efficiency
    Currently, due to insufficient raw cotton, the factory only operates 80 hours a week, and only 50,000 of the more than 63,000 spindles are in operation. If it cannot be fully opened recently, there will still be some surplus personnel in the factory. But they do not plan to lay off people, and are prepared to solve the problem by saving raw materials and improving output (efficiency). According to Factory Director He, they still have many phenomena of wasting raw materials that need to be improved. Moreover, although the output per spindle has been increased from 0.7 pounds to an average of 0.8 pounds, it is still possible to increase it to 0.9 pounds. This is their main goal recently. They also plan to further improve machine maintenance and material selection. They will strive to be more reasonable in personnel allocation and production organization, and strive to improve further in technology and product quality, as well as strive for closer labor-management relations, in order to achieve the goal of running the factory better.

### 拿出自己的力量办工厂  访问沪西私营统益纱厂

　　拿出自己的力量办工厂
    访问沪西私营统益纱厂
    本报特派记者  林韦
    销路不畅，资金周转不灵，原料不足，生产萎缩，是三月以来上海私营纺织业中一般都遇到的困难。但各厂的困难程度并不一样，而且相差很远。有一类厂是没有国家的扶助便寸步难行，非倒下去不可（现有十四个纱厂倒闭）；另有一类厂则虽有困难，但仍能自己支撑，在全国经济大改组的暂时困难中站得住脚。如果国家给以同等力量的扶助，则前一类厂仅可勉强不倒，后一类厂就能快步前进。沪西区的私营统益纱厂，即是后一类厂的一个代表。
  自力更生维持生产
    统益纱厂创建于一九二○年，现有纱锭六万三千余枚，电力织布机三百多架，员工共约二千八百人。是上海现有五十四家纱厂中规模较大，设备较好的一家。据该厂经理董春芳与厂长何致广谈，该厂创建以来的三十年中，曾经历过两次大的摧残。一次是在一九四一年日寇实行军事管理时期，被掠夺去原棉三万担，棉纱一千四百多件，棉布四万五千匹，机械修理机全部及其他财物很多。又一次是一九四八年蒋介石匪帮的八一九限价的掠夺，以及限价前夕最大的一次公债的掠夺（该厂独出美金三十多万）。解放以来，交通运输、原棉采购及产品销路等问题，均因战争尚未结束、农村生产力与购买力尚未提高，一时不能解决。加以花贵纱贱及匪机轰炸后电力供应不上，所以在维持生产上是一直有困难的。但至今为止，该厂没有任何一点外欠，也未向政府申请过贷款。除过极少数的特殊情况，他们几乎就从未向人借贷过。但是，机器与用品却在不断地补充，原棉也在不断地补进，经常能保持着两个月的所需。现在上海五十四家纱厂中，只有九家能自己支撑，统益即是其中之一（近因原棉不易采购，也想申请代纺一部分）。
    “我们并没有什么特殊的本领。”董经理解释说，“我们只是脚踏实地，勤勤恳恳，不冒险，不取巧，也不骗人。在营业好的时候没有别人家扩充得快，显得似乎有点保守；但在营业不好的时候也没有受多大的累。”何厂长在这个解释之外，又加了两句概括的说明：“我们是完全依靠自己拿出力量来办工厂，以工业的方针来办工厂。”
  正当经营生产第一
    在国民党反动统治时期，上海有许多工厂完全脱出了正常的工业轨道。勾结官僚买办，利用低利贷款、官价外汇和配给物资大发横财；借着股票投机、金银投机和买空卖空攫取暴利。有的是以高利拆借去做人民生活必需品的投机买卖。工厂内则腐败不堪，并不注意改革。解放以后，仍然利用物价一时未能稳定，继续着旧日的做法。以致在物价稳定，全国欢呼的时候，他们却与投机商人一道陷入了严重的困难，甚至停工倒闭。只有正当经营，改进生产管理，或者和投机取巧纠葛不多的工厂，才困难较轻，且能维持生产。统益纱厂就是正当经营的一家，因而困难较轻。他们历来不卖没有货品或货品不足的空栈单，不借没把握偿还的债款去投机。他们始终坚守着工业第一、生产第一的方针。厂内职员的数目，只占工人数目的百分之三点六。比一般纱厂职员所占比例小了一半以上（上海五十四家纱厂职员总数占工人总数百分之八）。他们用人的原则是有技术，有能力。厂内没有拿钱不做事、靠门子吃饭的冗员，也没有派系的倾轧。他们在决定采用或改变、废除某种制度或办法时，比较注意与职工商议。最近并准备逐步公开营业状况与账目。对于职工的福利如托儿所、医疗室、夜校（学习文化与技术）等，也办得比较努力。厂内的医生、药剂与教员，均由资方供给。这样，劳资关系历来比较正常，没有发生过大的纠纷。资方的思想是：“劳资关系弄不好，就无法进行生产。”工人方面，据当选为工会委员的几个工人谈，因为资方肯拿出力量来经营，没有拖欠工资，也不忽视福利，所以解放以来，全厂工人的生产情绪一直是上升的、稳定的。现在都在努力提高劳动效率，减少原料浪费，协助资方减低成本，增加生产。
  品质较高销路很好
    同时，该厂历来很注意保持产品的品质优越。在过去，他们的采花蝶牌纱、布和猫蝶牌纱，一直是牌子很响，卖得很远，并能卖到较高的价钱。解放后因市场与广大乡村中很欢迎廿支纱、四二支纱和十二磅细布，他们便改以生产这些纱布为主，所以销路较好。但据何厂长谈，他们现在产品的质量已经比从前较差了。原因是原棉不足，无法精选。而且花纱布公司在收购时，又一律按照牌价。
  前途乐观信心充足
    对于自己的工厂以至中国整个工业的前途，他们的看法是乐观的，信心是充足的。他们相信人民政府和中共在相当长的时期内允许私人资本主义经济存在与发展的政策是完全真实的，无可怀疑的。基于这种认识，他们把解放前夕逃避到香港的资金陆续调回，主动克服困难，维持生产。
    他们认为人民政府是“真诚心意要发展工业”，“事事都是从整个工业前途着想”。他们说：“比如政府提倡劳资协商以来，厂内大小事情双方都能开诚相见，合理解决，这就是发展工业最重要的条件，使大家对前途一般都有了信心。”特别是五月份华东纺织会议之后，据何厂长谈，“一般纱厂同业都看到了政府是真正在想办法帮助大家克服困难，实事求是，没有一点敷衍了事的现象。一件纱赔上四十六斤花来帮助大家开工，甚至赔更多的钱去国外购棉，有一点兼顾不够的地方都能自做检讨，这在国民党时代是做梦也想不到的。”
    对于目前的具体困难，他们相信毛主席的指示：“有困难的，有办法的，有希望的”。相信在解放台湾以后，封锁一定能完全打破。也相信经过土地改革与发展农业，纱厂的原料与销路问题一定能得到解决。他们对目前苏北等地扩充棉田，感到很大兴趣。他们希望纱厂同业要“依照政府的指示动作起来，拿出自己所有的力量来维持生产，改善生产的管理经营；不要坐着等待；不要有‘弄光了再请政府帮忙’的想法；也不要抱‘非弄光不能取谅于工人’的消极态度。”
    “按照四亿七千万人民的需要，全国现有的纱锭是绝对不够用的。不过，如果我们将来要扩充的话，一定不在上海扩充；我们要到西安或京汉沿线产棉区去另建新厂。”何厂长坦率愉快地表示着他的希望。
  减少浪费提高效率
    现在该厂由于原棉不足，每周开工只八十小时，六万三千多纱锭只开动五万。如果最近不能全开，厂内人员还多余一些。但他们不打算裁人，准备以节省原料，提高出数（效率）来解决。据何厂长谈，他们现在还有不少浪费原料的现象，需要改进。而且出数虽然每锭已从○·七磅提到平均○·八磅，但还有可能提高到○·九磅。这是他们最近努力的主要目标。他们还计划进一步改善机器保管、物料选择。在人事配备与生产组织上更求合理，在技术与产品质量上更求提高，至于劳资关系则更求密切，以达到把工厂办得更好的地步。
          一九五○·六·一一·于上海
