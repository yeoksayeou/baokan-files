Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st: The summer flood season has arrived in the Yangtze River. On the 16th of this month, the water level in Jiujiang in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River rose to 17.47 meters, and the water level in Wuhu rose to 8.88 meters, both exceeding the flood prevention water level. The Lower Yangtze River Engineering Bureau of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission is now actively carrying out summer flood prevention work in coordination with the East China coastal regions and city governments to ensure that no breaches occur in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River when the water level rises to the highest record of 1949, and to strive to prevent breaches when the water level rises to the highest record of 1931. (Note: The flood prevention water levels in various parts of the Yangtze River are calculated with Wusong as the zero point; Jiujiang is 17.16 meters, Wuhu is 8.83 meters, and Nanjing is 7.17 meters.)

The north and south embankment sections under the jurisdiction of the Lower Yangtze River Engineering Bureau, from the Anhui border to the estuary, have a total length of 1,385 kilometers of main embankments, which were comprehensively reinforced last winter and this spring. Since the beginning of summer, due to the lack of rain for a long time, cracks have appeared in the new soil on some embankments. The Lower Yangtze River Engineering Bureau has been strictly guarding against this, and with the decision of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government to allocate 11.6 million catties of rice for flood prevention funds, these are being successively allocated by various districts, cities, and the Tongma embankment section of Anhui. The bureau has also decided to establish five engineering offices in southern Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, northern Anhui, and the Tongma embankment section, sending out 110 engineering personnel. Each administrative region has promptly established flood prevention headquarters to unify leadership over flood prevention work. Currently, the primary task is to cooperate with the Water Conservancy Department of the East China Military and Political Committee and various administrative regions to inspect and accept the winter and spring repair projects, and to immediately process and repair areas where the projects are not consolidated. Administrative offices, special offices, counties, districts, townships, and villages should immediately delineate flood prevention sections, and each is responsible for guarding under unified command. The dangerous project in the Tongma embankment section of Anhui, which is as long as 83 kilometers, has been agreed to be jointly responsible with Hubei Province.

　　长江夏汛已到
    各地积极进行防汛
    【新华社上海二十一日电】长江夏汛已至。本月十六日长江下游九江水位已涨到一七点四七公尺，芜湖水位已涨到八点八八公尺，均超过防汛水位。长江水利委员会下游工程局现正配合华东沿江各地区、各城市人民政府积极展开夏季防汛工作，以保证长江下游在水位涨至一九四九年最高纪录时不发生溃决，并争取水位涨至一九三一年最高纪录时不发生溃决。（按：长江各地防汛水位以吴淞为零点计算，九江为一七点一六公尺，芜湖为八点八三公尺，南京为七点一七公尺。）
    长江下游工程局所辖南北堤段，自安徽境起到海口，干堤计长一千三百八十五公里，去冬今春曾进行全面培修。入夏以来，因久未下雨，部分堤上新土发生龟裂。长江下游工程局已严加防范，并经中央人民政府水利部决定防汛经费一千一百六十万斤大米，由各区、各市及安徽同马堤段陆续拨付。该局并已决定在苏南、苏北、皖南、皖北及同马堤段设立五个工程处，派出工程人员一百一十人。各行署区及时设立防汛指挥部统一领导防汛工作。目前首要工作是配合华东军政委员会水利部及各行署区验收冬修春修工程，对工程不巩固地区即刻加工补修。各行署、专署、县、区、乡、村间应立即划清防汛地段，在统一指挥下各负责守。安徽同马堤段长达八十三公里的险要工程，已商定与湖北省共同负责。
