　　US Embassy Instigates Thai Government's Reactionary Measures
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 22nd Dispatch] According to delayed news from Bangkok: The Thai Luang Phibunsongkhram fascist government is again preparing to ban a large number of overseas Chinese schools. Following Nai Kian Yimsiri, Director of the Department of Private Schools of the Thai government, broadcasting "Warning to Chinese Schools" on Bangkok Radio not long ago, the Thai Ministry of Education recently revealed that the ministry plans to reduce the current number of around 300 overseas Chinese schools in all 71 provinces of Thailand by half in the shortest possible time.
　　The Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary government successively closed seven overseas Chinese schools in southern Thailand in April. On May 21, it dispatched police to brutally search three overseas Chinese schools in Bangkok: Qiguang, Datong, and Xinghua, and arrested 18 faculty and staff members. Fifteen have been released on bail on May 27, but the remaining three have not yet been released.
　　Amidst the Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary government's intensified persecution of overseas Chinese schools, Sterling G. Cottrell, Second Secretary of the US Embassy in Thailand, "visited" Luang Saravet, Director-General of the Department of General Education of Thailand, on May 9. Afterwards, according to Thai official sources, the US Embassy expressed considerable satisfaction with the Thai reactionary government's closure of overseas Chinese schools.

　　泰政府谋封禁大批华校
    仅存的三百校将被迫减少一半
    美大使馆怂恿泰政府反动措施
    【新华社二十二日讯】据曼谷迟到消息：泰国銮披汶法西斯政府近又准备封禁大批华侨学校。继泰国政府民校局长乃坚·炎沙军于不久以前在曼谷电台发表《警告华校》的广播后，泰国教育部近又透露：该部拟在最短期间内，将泰国全境七十一府目前仅存的三百所左右的华侨学校减至一半。
    銮披汶反动政府曾于四月间先后封闭泰国南部华侨学校七所，又于五月二十一日出动警察，横蛮地搜查曼谷的启光、大同和醒华三所华侨学校，并捕去教职员十八人，除十五人已于五月二十七日保释外，其余三人尚无获释音讯。
    在銮披汶反动政府加紧迫害华侨学校声中，美国驻泰大使馆二等秘书史特立格曾于五月九日“访问”泰国普通教育厅长銮沙越。事后据泰国官方透露：美大使馆对泰国反动政府封闭华侨学校一举，表示相当满意。
