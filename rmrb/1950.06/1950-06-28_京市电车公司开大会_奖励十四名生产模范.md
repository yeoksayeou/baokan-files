　　Beijing Electric Tram Company Holds Grand Meeting
    Rewards Fourteen Production Models
    [Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Electric Tram Company held an award ceremony on the afternoon of the 25th of this month to reward fourteen model producers who have made significant contributions to invention, innovation, and technology improvement.
    From January to May of this year, the company received a total of ninety-one rationalization proposals, of which eighty-five were confirmed to be effective. These proposals significantly improved operation methods, greatly increased work efficiency, and transformed the past practice of relying solely on enthusiasm or increasing labor intensity for production. This award is based on the draft award regulations formulated by the company's management committee, and the fourteen outstanding model producers are being rewarded first, while the rest will be evaluated and rewarded separately.
    The collective award went to the West Transformer Plant of the Power Supply Department. Under the leadership of Section Chief Zhang Xiaolan and Foreman Liu Mingqi, all employees overcame various difficulties to repair two incomplete mercury arc rectifiers that had been stored for seven years. The Japanese and Kuomintang reactionaries had tried and failed to repair these two mercury arc rectifiers twice. Now that they have been repaired, the power supply for two hundred trams is guaranteed. The entire staff of the West Transformer Plant received a banner and a reward of 4,000 catties of millet. Individuals who received awards include: Lu Yuntai, foreman of the Repair Factory, who, through research and experimentation, installed resistance water baffles on locomotives, initially overcoming the difficulty of trams running in the rain, facilitating citizens' transportation on rainy days and increasing business revenue, receiving a reward of 880 catties of millet; Chen Qichang, director of the Power Plant, suggested adding a turbine alarm, which can detect turbine failures in time and avoid damage, receiving a reward of 860 catties of millet; tram drivers Zou Deli and Bai Ruqin, who had no breakdowns, no accidents, no missed shifts, and no lateness in four months, each received a reward of 500 catties of millet.
    The award ceremony was attended by Mu Zexian, Director of the Industry Bureau, Jia Tingsan, Deputy Director, and more than 300 leaders and employees from the company's Party, government, labor union, and youth league organizations. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely warm, and the fourteen model producers received boundless respect. Deputy Manager Wang introduced their achievements; Deputy Director Jia personally presented the awards and pinned the "Production Advanced" medals on their chests one by one. In their speeches, the leaders unanimously pointed out that these inventions, innovations, and technological improvements prove that the wisdom of the working class is infinite. They called on all employees to contribute even greater efforts to create new records and to make the people's trams serve the people better. (Han Zhenxing)
