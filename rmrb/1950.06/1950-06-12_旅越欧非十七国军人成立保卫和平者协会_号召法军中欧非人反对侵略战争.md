Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 8th: Soldiers of European and African nationalities, fighting alongside the Vietnamese people, recently established the "Association of Peace Defenders of European and African Nationals in Vietnam."

Shortly after its establishment, the "Association of Peace Defenders of European and African Nationals in Vietnam" issued a declaration stating: We, representatives of seventeen European and African countries with different political inclinations, social classes, religious beliefs, and nationalities, are currently fighting alongside Vietnamese soldiers and have decided to establish an "Association of Peace Defenders of European and African Nationals in Vietnam" on the basis of mutual respect to strive for the establishment of lasting peace among all nations.

From an international point of view, we support the United Nations Charter and oppose all military alliances that violate this charter and lead to a Third World War; we advocate the prohibition of atomic weapons; we believe that striving for the independence and self-determination of all nations is a prerequisite for freedom and peace.

Regarding Vietnam, we will do our best to use all means to make the European and African troops in the French army understand the main reasons for engaging in an unjust war in Vietnam; to tell them about the struggle of people all over the world to end the French colonial war in Vietnam and to defend world peace; to call on them to oppose the French colonial war in Vietnam and demand immediate repatriation.

　　旅越欧非十七国军人成立保卫和平者协会
    号召法军中欧非人反对侵略战争
    【新华社十日讯】据越南通讯社北越八日讯：与越南人民并肩作战的属于欧洲和非洲十七个国籍的军人，最近成立了“旅越欧非和平保卫者协会”。
    “旅越欧非和平保卫者协会”在成立后不久即发表宣言称：我们，欧洲和非洲十七个国家不同政治倾向、社会阶级、宗教信仰和民族的代表，目前正与越南战士并肩作战，并决定在互相尊重的基础上，创立一个为建立各民族间持久和平而斗争的“旅越欧非和平保卫者协会”。
    从国际观点说来，我们支持联合国宪章，反对一切违反这个宪章和导向第三次世界大战的军事联盟；我们拥护禁用原子武器；我们认为争取各民族的独立和自决权是自由与和平的先决条件。
    关于越南，我们当尽力用一切方法，让法军中的欧洲人和非洲人部队明白在越南从事非正义战争的主要原因；告诉他们全世界人民为结束法国在越南的殖民战争和为保卫世界和平的斗争情况；号召他们反对法国在越南的殖民战争并要求立即回国。
