　　Speech by Li Siguang, Vice President of the Academy of Sciences
　　[Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd] Li Siguang, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice President of the Academy of Sciences, delivered the following full text of his speech at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC on June 21st: Chairman, fellow delegates, and gentlemen:
　　A few days ago, when Premier Zhou reported on the international situation, he occasionally mentioned some news that I personally brought back from Western Europe. Although that news is not recent, when combined with some recent news, we can more or less understand what kind of world Western Europe is now. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to give a brief report to you gentlemen today.
　　The topic can be divided into two aspects: one is about the key to the current situation in Western Europe, and the other is about their views on us and the actions they have taken and may take in the future. Speaking first about their own situation, the first fact we must admit is that the group of Western European countries, large and small, are all political systems established under the capitalist system. Most of them are empires with colonies, so their ruling class must be imperialists. Secondly, these dilapidated empires are truly dwarfed by American imperialism. The nature of imperialists is the same as the nature of capitalists, with inevitable internal contradictions, that is, big capitalists want to devour small capitalists, and big imperialists want to devour small imperialists. Today, it is very clear that American imperialism is a big imperialist, that is, a political structure containing large capital groups. To be honest: they want to devour Western Europe. The Atlantic Alliance, the European Economic Recovery Program, the Marshall Plan, etc., are all steps for American imperialism to devour Western Europe.
　　In order to maintain their precarious lives, Western European countries have to beg for help from American imperialism on the one hand, and have to try to resist it on the other hand. At the same time, they cannot avoid mutual infighting. Their main difficulty lies here, and the strategy of American imperialism to control Western Europe must also be found here. What American imperialism requires is a unified Western Europe (including West Germany). This unified Western Europe must be completely dominated by the US dollar and completely driven by the US General Staff. However, from the standpoint of the group of small imperialists in Western Europe, being a son and being a doormat in this way is unimaginable. The most difficult part of this is probably the veteran imperialist, Britain, because Britain has never publicly admitted that it has lost its qualification as a major imperialist. Therefore, for American imperialism to subdue Western Europe, it actually has to subdue Britain. The method of subduing is different at all times and places. When speaking kindly, it will say: "We English-speaking people must unite." However, this also provokes the hatred of those non-English-speaking people; when using methods, it unites those countries that hate the British Empire to put pressure on it.
　　Since last year, many specific problems have come to the fore, and neither the British nor the American side can conceal them. Among the most important ones, for example, Britain proposed a method at the end of last year: supplying kerosene from Middle Eastern oil fields, which could reduce the expenditure of US dollars by the equivalent of 200 million pounds each year; this method actually provoked the US Congress to question Acheson whether he agreed that Marshall's aid was to destroy a huge American industry. For example, the US Congress often questioned whether Western Europe could be turned into a unified commercial area in 1952 (the year the Marshall Plan is completed), that is, to implement conditions such as the unification of customs and currency exchange in Western European countries. Everyone knows that this is a dream, and everyone understands that the main obstacle is Britain. Furthermore, the British government has repeatedly stated that they cannot increase their military expenditure, which they can no longer afford to increase, because they accept a few dozen heavy bombers from the United States. Also, Britain says on the one hand that it welcomes the US investment in economically backward regions according to Truman's Point Four, but in fact, the British Colonial Development Corporation has been forced to refuse loans from the International Bank. They openly said that many of the conditions of American imperialism are unacceptable to any country with colonies. The Schuman Plan recently proposed by France has certainly received Washington's prior approval (refer to Xinhua News Agency's report on June 17th). These are all manifestations of American imperialism seizing other small imperialists in Western Europe to subdue Britain.
　　Why is Britain living in such contradictions? Simply put, it is because the general party members of their currently most powerful political party—the Labour Party—do not understand that there is no "middle road." Looking at the situation, I am afraid that it will not be until their workers' living standards are reduced to a lower level, and they suffer more severe internal and external oppression, that they will rise up to resist the ruling class. That day will come sooner or later. By that time, the entire Western Europe will change.
　　Speaking of the second aspect: obviously, those countries in Western Europe, like American imperialism, stand in opposition to us. They are here to exploit, oppress, and enslave us, and we are here to be free from their oppression, exploitation, and enslavement in every sense. Therefore, they are either indifferent to our people's liberation movement, or give us hypocritical sympathy, or even harbor absurd illusions, thinking that we might leave our great and loyal ally, the Soviet Union, and walk to our own doom, falling into their trap, or stubbornly use the airplane policy to replace the gunboat policy, but there are also many progressive workers and intellectuals who wholeheartedly support our great movement. Only these people truly recognize that the imperialism we have destroyed is the imperialism and capitalism that oppresses them. In the past year or so, their attitude towards us has shown many contradictions, including their ruling class. Their contradictory performances are mostly due to a lack of foresight, haggling over their current interests, and their current interests often conflict with the interests of American imperialism. In the past, in order to maintain their position and interests, they have always done everything possible, especially colluding with bureaucrats, compradors, and all other reactionaries, to prevent and undermine our revolutionary movement. In the future, we can imagine that they will continue to do evil in the same way.
　　But this does not matter, because this time our mighty movement has a broad mass base. Through Chairman Mao's careful consideration and instructions, the leadership of the Central and local People's Governments and the Chinese Communist Party, we have gained a correct and profound understanding. We have the greatest determination, unite as one, overcome all the conspiracies of domestic and foreign reactionaries, continue to complete the revolutionary cause, and build a strong, world peace-guaranteeing country that will gradually move from new democracy to socialism.

### 科学院副院长  李四光的发言

    李四光的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】全国委员会委员、科学院副院长李四光二十一日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言全文如下：主席，各位代表和各位列席先生：
    前几天周总理报告国际情况的时候，偶而提到我个人从西欧方面带来的一点消息，那一点消息，虽然不是最近的，然而参合一些最近的消息看来，我们多少可以知道西欧现在是一个什么样子的世界。因此，也许值得今天在诸位先生面前再作一次约略的报告。
    话可以分两方面说：一方面是关于造成西欧现状的关键所在，另一方面是关于他们对我们的观感以及他们已经采取和将来可能采取的行动。先说他们本身的情况，我们首先要承认的事实是：西欧那一群国家，大大小小的都是在资本制度下建立起来的一些政治系统，他们多半都是拥有殖民地的帝国，所以他们的统治阶级，必然是帝国主义者。其次是：他们这些残破的帝国，比起美帝来，真是小巫见了大巫。帝国主义者的本性和资本主义者的本性一样，有无可避免的内在的矛盾，就是大资本家要吃小资本家，大帝国主义者要吃小帝国主义者。今天很清楚，美帝是个大帝国主义者，也就是包藏大资本集团的政治结构。老老实实的说：他们是要吃西欧的。什么大西洋联盟，欧洲经济复兴计划，马歇尔援欧计划等等，都是美帝要吃西欧的步骤。
    西欧各国为了维持他们垂危的生命，一方面不得不向美帝乞怜，而另一方面又不得不设法抗拒，同时他们彼此又不能避免相互倾轧，他们主要的困难，就在这里，而美帝控制西欧的策略，也要在这里找出来。美帝所要求的，是一个单纯的西欧（连西德在内），这个单纯的西欧，要完全受美元支配，并且要完全受美帝参谋部的驱使。然而从西欧那一群小帝国主义者的立场看来，这样做儿子，这样做垫子，是不可想像的。其中最困难的一部分，恐怕要算帝国主义的老手英国，因为英国始终不肯公开承认，他已经失去了一个大帝国主义者的资格，所以美帝要制服西欧，实际就要制服英国，制服的方法，时时处处不同，讲好话的时候，就要说：“我们这些讲英语的人民，要联合起来。”然而这又惹起那些不讲英语人民的讨厌；用手段的时候，就联合那些讨厌英帝国的国家，来对他加以压力。
    从去年起，许多具体的问题，露出了头面，英美两方面，都无法掩饰，其中最主要的，例如英国去年年底提出一种办法：从中东油田，供给煤油，每年可以减少等于两亿英镑的美元的支出；这种办法，竟惹起美国国会方面质问艾奇逊，是否同意了马歇尔的援助是要破坏美国的一种巨大的工业。又如美国国会方面常常质问，究竟是否在一九五二年（马歇尔计划完成的年度）可以把西欧变成一个单纯的通商区域，就是说：要实行西欧各国税关统一，货币交换等等条件。谁也知道这是梦想，谁也明白，主要的障碍就是英国。再一层，英国政府一再表示，他们不能因为接受美国几打重轰炸机，而要增加他们事实上再也不能增加的军费负担。还有，英国一面说欢迎根据杜鲁门第四点美国对经济落后地域的投资，而事实上英国殖民地开发局搞到不能不拒绝国际银行的借款，他们公开的说：美帝许多的条件是任何有殖民地的国家所不能接受的。最近法国所提出的舒曼计划，当然事先得了华盛顿的同意（参考六月十七日新华社的消息），这些都是美帝抓住西欧其他小帝国主义者来压服英帝的表现。
    英国为什么在这样矛盾中讨生活呢？简单的说：就是他们现在号称最有力的一个政党——工党——的一般党员不了解没有“中间路线”，看形势恐怕要到他们工人生活水准，搞到更低，受内外压迫更厉害的时候，他们才起来反抗统治阶级，那一天迟早一定要来临的。到那时候，整个的西欧，就要变样子了。
    说到第二方面：很明显的，西欧那些国家也和美帝一样站在我们反对的地位，他们是来剥削压迫奴役我们的，而我们是要在一切的意义上，不受他们的压迫，剥削和奴役的。因此，他们对我们的人民解放运动，或者漠不关心，或者给我们虚伪的同情，甚至于存着荒谬的幻想，以为我们或者可以离开我们伟大而且忠实的盟友苏联，自走死路，掉到他们的陷阱里面，或者硬要用飞机政策来代替炮船政策，但是也有不少的进步的工人和知识分子，竭尽热诚来拥护我们这样伟大的运动，唯有这一般人才真正认识我们所摧毁的帝国主义，就是压迫他们的帝国主义资本主义。在过去一年多的时期，他们对我们的态度，表现出不少的矛盾，包括他们的统治阶级。他们那些前后矛盾的表现，多半是由于缺少远见，斤斤较量他们目前的利益，而他们目前的利益，又和美帝的利益，往往是互相冲突的。在过去他们为了保持他们的地位和利益，始终总是尽一切可能的方法，尤其是勾结官僚，买办和其他一切反动分子来阻止并破坏我们的革命运动。今后我们可以想像到，他们还要用同样的方法来继续作恶。
    不过这是不要紧的，因为这一次我们这浩浩荡荡的运动，有了广大民众的基础，经过毛主席慎密的考虑和指示，中央和各级人民政府以及中国共产党的领导，我们已经得到了正确而且深刻的认识。我们有了最大的决心，团结一致，克服国内外反动者种种的阴谋，继续完成革命大业，建设强大的，保障世界和平的，由新民主主义一步一步的而达到社会主义的国家。
