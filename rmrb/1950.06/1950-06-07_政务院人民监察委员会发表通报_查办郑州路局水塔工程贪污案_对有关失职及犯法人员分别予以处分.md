Xinhua News Agency, May 5th – The People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a circular on the handling of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's water tower project embezzlement and waste case on the 4th, announcing the case's background, causes, and the punishments for relevant personnel. After the case occurred, the People's Supervision Committee sent a supervision team in March, which, together with inspection personnel from the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Ministry of Railways, formed an investigation committee, conducted a thorough investigation, and proposed handling suggestions, which have been approved and announced by the Government Administration Council.

Incident Overview

The circular briefly outlined the incident: In November 1949, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau contracted out the construction of sixteen 120-ton water towers. The estimated cost for each tower was 618,500 catties of wheat. Due to the construction section leaking the railway's secrets and colluding with contractors to raise bid prices, the section chief and director of the engineering department were irresponsible and failed to review and research the bids. The railway bureau's leaders approved the project carelessly, resulting in the project being contracted out at a high price of 969,200 catties of wheat per tower. Including the steel provided by the railway bureau, each tower actually cost 1,233,200 catties, exceeding the estimated cost by 99.4%. Excluding steel and cement, each tower's contract price resulted in a loss of 519,200 catties based on the market price at the time. In addition, the contract stipulated that the formwork and scaffolding would be given to the contractor without charge upon completion, resulting in a total loss of 9,109,040 catties of wheat for the sixteen water towers. Although a large portion of the loss was avoided because the incident was discovered early and both parties agreed to cancel the original contract and establish a new one, the contractor had already received 640,000 catties of wheat in excess. This sum could not be recovered for some time and created a stagnation of funds, causing no small loss. Moreover, the contractor used the project funds for speculative activities such as hoarding materials and purchasing gold, which had an adverse impact on the national economy. In addition, the water tower incident directly led to the high-priced contracting out of thirteen fourth-class ticket office projects, resulting in an additional loss of over 500,000 catties of wheat.

The Direct Cause of the Incident Was Staff Embezzlement and Corruption

The circular pointed out that the direct cause of the incident was the embezzlement and corruption of Pei Baoren and Gu Baoshan, the director and deputy director-level staff members of the construction section responsible for contracting out the water tower project, who leaked secrets and colluded with contractors to raise bid prices. Pei and Gu had frequent contact with contractors, often eating, drinking, and gambling together. Before the bidding, Pei and Gu leaked important secrets of the railway bureau's water tower construction to the contractors. After the bidding, Pei Baoren distorted the facts, fabricated reasons, and claimed that although the bid price was high, it was "still reasonable," and repeatedly deceived leaders, telling the section chief and director: "The unit price has been reviewed and there are absolutely no problems." Pei, Gu, and others also requested a reduction in the contractor's guarantee conditions and repeatedly urged the finance department to issue payments to the contractor. Because a Zhengzhou contractor was unable to participate in the water tower bidding (the contractor was from out of town), Gu Baoshan asked the contractor, Hu Disong, to host a dinner and contracted out the construction project of thirteen ticket offices at a high price, bribing Yuhua and eight other contractors to prevent them from reporting the situation, resulting in the railway bureau losing more than 500,000 catties of wheat. In addition, construction worker Yu Ruyi violated regulations and issued extra free freight bills worth more than 53.2 million yuan and exempted tickets worth more than 800,000 yuan to the contractor (not the water tower contractor). This proves that their collusion with the contractor was not something that happened only recently.

In the collusion with the contractors, the contractors promised to generously reward them after the completion of the project. By the time the incident was discovered, Gu Baoshan had already taken cash, fur coats, bicycles, and more than twenty other items from the contractor, worth a total of more than 3,000 catties of wheat. The contractor even married him a concubine in Zhengzhou. When clerk Chen Weici went to Shanghai to verify the guarantee, he asked the contractor for watches, pens, and other items worth a total of more than 1.8 million yuan. Zhu Junming, from the finance department, who helped verify the guarantee, also asked the contractor for a watch. Yu Ruyi asked the contractor for a pen.

Responsible Personnel at All Levels of the Engineering Department Should Be Held Responsible for the Incident

Secondly, the irresponsibility of the responsible personnel at all levels of the engineering department was also an important reason for the incident.

Cheng Pingfan, deputy director of the engineering department, and Zhang Yiming, chief of the engineering section, were both engineers, but they never had a detailed plan or research for the construction of the water tower, and they did not conduct on-site investigations. The construction site was determined in the office, and the size of the water tower was imagined. The design of the water tower was also moved from the Northeast, so the location, size, and other aspects had to be changed repeatedly, causing many losses. They abandoned leadership over the work of the construction section and did not supervise or inspect. They did not attend the bidding, and even long after the water tower incident occurred, they still knew very little about the site conditions. This shows that they were very irresponsible in their work.

Deputy engineer Zhao Xianzeng catered to sentiment and neglected his work. Knowing that the bid price was too high, he did not report it to the leading cadres, believing that the bid price was not related to the designer. Pei Baoren asked him to create a budget of 1.3 million catties of wheat based on the bid price of Xinghua Construction Company. Although he disagreed in his heart, he was afraid of offending people and still complied.

Lu Ming, secretary and chief of the personnel section, was responsible for managing the issuance of free tickets. When Yu Ruyi asked to manage them, Lu Ming knew that it was wrong, and others raised objections, but he still allowed it, allowing Yu to abuse the issuance of free tickets.

Zhang Fen, director of the engineering department, was arrogant, self-satisfied, disorganized, undisciplined, irresponsible, and used people improperly, and should be held greatly responsible for the occurrence of the water tower incident. Although Zhang Fen was not familiar with engineering business, he was not humble and did not respect leading cadres enough. Before constructing the water tower, he did not discuss it in detail with the bureau chief and military representative, nor did he conduct any investigation or research. He pushed the approval of official documents to the deputy director, and gave his two seals to the chief of the finance section and the secretary. He simply instructed his subordinates: "You go ahead and do it boldly, do it first and report later, I'll take responsibility if something goes wrong," blindly believing that marking up documents was a hiding place for bureaucracy. Therefore, he was not clear about the design, contracting process, and document exchanges of the water tower project. After the water tower was contracted out, someone suggested that "the water tower was contracted out at a high price," but he still did not investigate and handle it promptly. It was not until the corruption was revealed that he became flustered. Zhang Fen also made a principled mistake in appointing Gu Baoshan. Gu only started working in February 1949, came from a contractor background, and had extremely bad character. However, Zhang Fen was not vigilant about Gu Baoshan's bad ideological style. On the contrary, he was deceived by Gu Baoshan's temporary false enthusiasm for work. Not only did he transfer him from Xinxiang to the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and promote him to deputy director-level staff member, but he also consciously asked him to impersonate an old cadre. As a result, Gu Baoshan became a "popular person" in the construction section and dared to act recklessly and do whatever he wanted.

The Root Cause of the Incident Was Bureaucracy in the Railway Bureau

The circular pointed out that the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau guaranteed military transport and completed major line repairs last year, especially in the last four months, and has made significant achievements and progress in its business. However, it was found during this inspection that the railway bureau still has a serious bureaucratic style and lacks a concept of cherishing state and people's property. The responsible personnel of the railway bureau only thought that the task was urgent, the price of goods fluctuated, and urged the engineering department to use the project funds quickly. This directly promoted the engineering department's action of contracting out while reporting. For such a large water tower project, the person in charge of the railway bureau neither sent responsible cadres to participate in the supervision of the bidding, nor did they review and study it after knowing that the bid price was too high. They approved it in a muddle-headed manner. After the corruption case was revealed, the person in charge of the railway bureau had not really attached importance to the water tower incident until the supervision team arrived. The railway bureau also lacked a system of collective leadership and division of responsibility, and there was no communication between those who reviewed official documents. Therefore, Pei Baoren was able to take advantage of this loophole to obtain the "signature" of the leading personnel.

For more than a year, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has done a very poor job in mobilizing workers and democratizing management, and the workers' awareness has not been raised to the appropriate level. Therefore, the political atmosphere in the railway bureau is not strong, the enthusiasm of staff and workers cannot be fully developed, and unity is not good enough. Individual bad elements can take advantage of the opportunity to stir up trouble, which is the root cause of the water tower incident.

Announcement of Punishments

The circular announced the following punishments for the above-mentioned personnel: Pei Baoren and Gu Baoshan were both dismissed from their positions and, according to the regulations of the Ministry of Railways, expelled from the railway system and sent to judicial organs for punishment according to law. Zhang Fen, director of the engineering department, was dismissed from his position. Wu Shien, director of the railway bureau, and Xu Ziwei, military representative, were each given a major demerit. Zhang Zhisheng and Geng Yifan, deputy directors, were each given a minor demerit. Chen Weici, Yu Ruyi, Cheng Pingfan, Zhang Yiming, Lu Ming, Zhu Junming, and Zhao Xianzeng were punished by the Ministry of Railways according to the severity of their mistakes. In addition, Huang Tongguang, an engineer from Zhengzhou Public Xinghua Construction Company, participated in private businessmen raising bids, Li Langu, the manager, knew about it but did not ask, and Yu Bin, the deputy manager, did not actively investigate and pursue it after the case was revealed. The city government punished them separately. Hu Disong, manager of the Fuxing Construction Factory in Hankou, was the leader and organizer of raising bids, constantly using money, goods, gambling, and women to win over and corrupt public officials, and colluding with contractors to discuss bid prices and organize raising bids. After the incident was discovered, he did not repent at all and organized contractors to prepare to threaten the railway bureau. His contract to repair the water tower project should be terminated and he should be sent to the Zhengzhou People's Court for handling according to law.

　　政务院人民监察委员会发表通报
    查办郑州路局水塔工程贪污案
    对有关失职及犯法人员分别予以处分
    【新华社五日讯】中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会于四日发表关于查办郑州铁路管理局水塔工程贪污浪费案件的通报，公布案件经过、原因和对有关人员的处分。该案发生后，人民监察委员会曾于三月间派出监察小组，会同最高人民检察署和铁道部派出的检查人员组成调查委员会，进行了周密的调查，并提出处理意见，兹经政务院批准公布。
  事件经过
    通报略述事件经过称：一九四九年十一月郑州路局发包十六座一百二十吨水塔。每座概算为六十一万八千五百斤小麦。由于工事股泄漏路方秘密，勾通包商抬高标价，工务处课长、处长不负责任，未加审核研究，路局领导人马虎批准，该项工程竟以每座九十六万九千二百斤小麦的高价包出。加上由路局供给的钢筋，每座实折合一百二十三万三千二百斤，超出概算百分之九十九点四。除钢筋、洋灰不计外，按照当时市价，每座包价损失五十一万九千二百斤，加上合同中规定完工后将模型板、脚手板无价归于包商，十六座水塔共计损失九百一十万九千零四十斤小麦。虽因事件被发觉较早，双方议定将原合同废除，另立合同，避免了大部损失，但包商已多领六十四万斤小麦，这笔款项一时收不回来，呆滞资金，已造成不小损失。而包商利用工款以囤积物资和购买黄金等项投机活动，更使国家经济受到不良影响。此外，水塔事件又直接引起了以高价发包十三座四等票房工程的事件，增加损失小麦五十余万斤。
  事件发生的直接原因是工作人员贪污腐化
    通报指出事件发生的直接原因，是负责水塔工程发包工作的工事股正、副主任课员裴保仁、古宝山等贪污腐化，泄露秘密，勾通包商抬高标价。裴、古二人和包商来往很多，经常一起吃喝、赌博。开标前，裴、古二人即将路局建修水塔的重要秘密泄露给包商。开标后裴保仁又歪曲事实，捏造理由，认为标价虽高“尚属合理”，且几次欺瞒领导人员，向课长、处长说：“单价已审核过了，绝无问题。”裴、古等又要求降低包商的取保条件，多次催促财务处给包商发款等。郑州包商因未能参加上述包商（系外地客商）的水塔投标，表示不满，古宝山即要包商胡迪松出面请客，并以高价发包十三座票房的修建工程，收买了裕华等八家包商，不使告发，致路局又损失五十余万斤小麦。此外工务员于汝翼不遵规约，曾额外给包商（非水塔包商）开免费托运单五千三百二十余万元，免票八十余万元。这证明他们与包商的勾结作弊，已非一日。
    裴、古在勾结包商中，包商曾允许在工程完工后重酬。至事件被发觉时，古宝山已要了包商的现款、皮袄、自行车等二十多种东西，总值小麦三千余斤。包商并在郑州给他娶小老婆。司事陈慰慈赴上海对保时，向包商要了手表、钢笔等东西，总值一百八十余万元。财务处帮助对保的朱俊明也向包商要了一只手表。于汝翼向包商要了一枝钢笔。
  工务处各级负责人员对事件发生应负责任
    其次，工务处各级负责人员不负责任，也是事件发生的重要原因。
    工务处副处长程屏藩、工程课长张乙铭都是工程师，但对修建水塔始终没有详细计划、研究，没有到现场进行调查。修建的地点是在办公室里确定的，水塔的大小是想像出来的。水塔的图样也是从东北搬来的，以致地点、大小等不得不一改再改，造成许多损失。他们对工事股的工作放弃领导，没有督促检查。开标时不去参加，水塔事件发生很久以后，他们对工地情况仍知道得很少。这说明他们对工作很不负责任。
    副工程师赵宪曾恂于情面，玩忽工作，明知标价太贵，不向领导干部反映，认为标价贵贱与设计人无关。裴保仁要他照兴华建筑公司标价补造一百三十万斤小麦的预算，心里虽不同意，但怕得罪人，仍然照办。
    秘书兼人事股长路明，负责掌握开发免票。当于汝翼要求掌管时，路明明知不对，又经别人提出不同意见，而竟然允许，使于得以滥发免票。
    工务处长章奋骄傲自满，无组织无纪律，不负责任和用人不当，对水塔事件的发生应负重大责任。章奋虽对工程业务不够熟习，但又不虚心，对领导干部也尊重不够。修建水塔，事前没有和局长、军事代表详细商讨，亦毫无调查研究。他把批公文推给了副处长，两个手章，交给了财经课长和秘书。他只是简单地指示下级：“你们大胆地干，作了再说，错了我负责任”，盲目地认为公文划行是官僚主义的藏身窝。因而对水塔工程的设计、发包过程及公文往来都不清楚。当水塔发包后，有人提出“水塔包贵了”，他仍然不及时认真追查处理。直到贪污内幕揭明，他才手忙脚乱。在任用古宝山问题上，章奋也犯了原则错误。古于一九四九年二月才开始参加工作，出身包商，品质极坏。但章奋对于古宝山的恶劣的思想作风却毫无警惕，反而为他一时工作的假积极所蒙惑，不仅把他自新乡调来郑州路局升为副主任课员，而且有意识地叫他冒充老干部，因而古宝山成了工事股的“红人”，敢于无法无天，胡作非为。
  事件发生的根本原因是路局存在官僚主义
    通报指出郑州路局去年保证了军运，完成了线路大修，特别最近四个月来，在业务上有显著的成绩和进步。但此次检查中发现路局领导方面还存在着严重的官僚主义作风和缺乏爱护国家人民财产的观点。路局的负责人员只想到任务迫切，物价波动，催着工务处快用工款。这就直接促成工务处一面发包，一面呈报的行动。对这样大的水塔工程，路局负责人既未派负责干部参加监标，以后明知标价过高，也未审核研究，糊里糊涂地盖章批准，贪污案情被揭发后，直到监察组到达以前，路局负责人始终没有把水塔事件真正重视起来。路局并缺乏集体领导分工负责制度，批阅公文互不接头。因而裴保仁就得以利用这个空子获得了领导人员的“照签”。
    一年多来，郑州铁路局在发动工人及管理民主化方面工作也做得很差，工人觉悟未能提高到应有的程度。因此路局政治空气不浓厚，职员和工人的积极性不能充分发扬，团结也不够好，个别坏分子便有机可乘，兴风作浪，这就是水塔事件的根本原因。
    宣布处分
    通报宣布对上述人员分别予以处分：裴保仁、古宝山均予以撤职，根据铁道部规定，开除路籍，并解送司法机关依法惩办。工务处长章奋予以撤职。路局局长吴士恩、军事代表许子威各记大过一次。副局长张之生、耿一凡各记小过一次。陈慰慈、于汝翼、程屏藩、张乙铭、路明、朱俊明、赵宪曾由铁道部根据其所犯错误之轻重分别予以处分。此外，郑州市公营兴华建筑公司工程师黄彤光参与私商抬标活动，经理李兰谷明知不问，副经理于斌于案情揭露后，不积极检查追究，由该市府分别予以处分。汉口包商复兴营造厂经理胡迪松是抬标之领导者和组织者，不断以金钱、物品、赌博、女人拉拢和腐化公务人员，并串通包商计议标价，组织抬标。事件被发觉后毫不悔悟，又组织包商，准备威胁路局，应停止其包修水塔工程，送郑州市人民法院依法办理。
