　　Yuehan Railway Miluo Station Train Separation Collision Accident
    Supervisory Committee Disciplines Negligent Personnel
    [Xinhua News Agency] The Yuehan Railway Miluo Station under the Hengyang Railway Administration experienced a train separation collision accident on March 22nd. The People's Supervisory Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council has conducted a detailed investigation into the accident and has disciplined the responsible personnel accordingly.
    The course of the accident is as follows:
    On March 22nd, Freight Train No. 2358, hauling twenty-four cars, departed from Changsha North. While ascending the slope at Fanjia Garden after passing Miluo Station, the train experienced wheel slippage due to rain on the tracks. After a brief stop, the locomotive slightly reversed and then restarted, causing the rear eleven cars to detach and roll downhill towards Miluo. The detached cars passed through Miluo Station and collided with Passenger Train No. 172, which was approaching from the opposite direction, resulting in significant losses. Ten soldiers were killed, and seventeen soldiers were injured, some seriously. The caboose of Train No. 2358 was completely destroyed, the freight car in front of the caboose was overturned, and the remaining nine cars were also damaged.
    The People's Supervisory Committee's handling of the responsible personnel is as follows:
    Liu Fulin, the conductor of Train No. 2358, was fully responsible for the train's operation. When the train experienced wheel slippage and stopped, he neither got out of the train to inspect and handle the situation, nor did he take effective measures after the cars detached. He also failed to inform the soldiers inside the train to prepare for the danger. When he saw Train No. 172 approaching head-on, he jumped off the train and escaped. Cheng Zaizhong, the driver of Train No. 172, saw a red light (the caboose’s red light from the runaway cars) when entering Miluo Station at the distant signal, but he did not reduce speed or pay attention to observation. The above two individuals should bear primary responsibility for this accident. In addition to being dismissed and expelled from the railway system according to the Ministry of Railways' regulations, they will be handed over to the judicial organs for punishment according to the law.
    The leading cadres of the Hengyang Railway Administration were ideologically paralyzed, did not work hard enough to eliminate accidents, and lacked concrete supervision and inspection to prevent accidents. For example, regarding the installation of air pipes, neither the vehicle nor the locomotive departments of the administration gave any instructions to the various stations. The rear fourteen cars of Train No. 2358 did not have air pipes and could not be used for braking after separation. One-fifth of the freight cars in the administration were not equipped with air pipes, but the inventory of air pipes was sufficient for installation. Furthermore, although the administration had regulations to prevent the expansion of train separation accidents, they were not actively implemented, and the importance of traffic safety was severely lacking. Therefore, Wu Yinglun, the director of the Traffic Department of the Hengyang Railway Administration, Gu Qiweng, the director of the Locomotive Department, and Zhou Wuyi, the director of the Changsha Office, were each given a minor demerit. Guo Weicheng, the director of the Hengyang Railway Administration, Ma Zai, the political commissar, and Liu Chuanshu, the deputy director, were each given a warning.
    Other negligent staff and workers, including Zhang Yanxuan, the inspector foreman of the Changsha Inspection Section, Lu Ronggui, the inspector craftsman, Xu Gangfeng, the brakeman of Train No. 2358, Song Fuhua, the train driver, Lü Xunqing, the stationmaster of Miluo Station, Lu Erchuan, the fireman of Train No. 172, Fu Guoqing, the bridge worker of Miluo River, Su Shirong, the director of the Wudong Locomotive Depot, Lu Weizhou, the director of the Changsha Traffic Section, and Liu Baixiang, the director of the Changsha Inspection Section, will be punished by the Ministry of Railways according to the severity of their responsibilities.
    The People's Supervisory Committee believes that Liu Shicai, the switchman of Fanjia Garden, worked conscientiously and responsibly and reported the train separation promptly. He should be rewarded by the Ministry of Railways.

　　粤汉路汨罗站发生列车分离冲突事故
    监察委员会处分失职人员
    【新华社讯】衡阳铁路管理局粤汉路汨罗车站，曾于三月二十二日发生列车分离冲突事故。中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会已对该事故作了详密调查，并分别处分了各失职人员。
    该事故发生的经过如下：
    三月二十二日，第二三五八次货物列车牵引二十四辆车，由长沙北开，经过汨罗车站到范家园上坡时，因天雨轨滑，发生空转现象，机车略停后退，再开时，后部十一辆车脱钩，顺坡向汨罗方面溜逸。脱钩车辆溜过汨罗站后，与对面开来的一七二次客车相撞，造成重大损失。计死亡战士十名，轻重伤战士十七名。二三五八次车守车全毁，守车前之货车颠覆，其余九辆亦均有损伤。
    人民监察委员会对各失职人员的处理办法如下：
    二三五八次列车车长刘福林身负列车运转全责，在列车发生空转停止时，既未下车检查料理，迨车辆脱钩溜逸后又未及时作有效措施，亦未告诉车内战士作防险准备，至发现一七二次列车迎头驶来时，却自行跳车脱险。一七二次列车进入汨罗站远距标时，司机程再忠发现前面有红灯（即溜逸车辆守车之红灯），但并未降低速度，亦未注意了望。以上两人对此次事故应负主要责任，除予以撤职和根据铁道部规定开除路籍外，送司法机关依法惩办。
    衡阳铁路管理局领导干部，思想麻痹，对消灭事故努力不够，对防止事故缺乏具体督促与检查。如安装风管问题，该局车、机两处对各站段均未作任何指示。二三五八次列车后部十四辆车没有风管，分离后不能用以停车。该局运货车辆有五分之一未装风管，但库存风管数量足够装用。又该局虽定有防止列车分离扩大事故办法，但未积极执行，对行车安全重视极为不够。为此，衡阳路局车务处长吴应伦、机务处长顾启文、长沙办事处处长周武彝，各记小过一次。衡阳局局长郭维城、政委马载、副局长刘传书，各予警告处分。
    其余长沙检车段验车领班张延选、检车匠鲁荣贵、二三五八次列车司轫徐钢锋、列车司机宋傅华、汨罗站长吕勋卿、一七二次列车司炉陆二川、汨罗江桥工傅国清、武东机务段长苏世荣、长沙车务段长鲁维周、长沙检车段长刘柏祥等各失职职员、工人由铁道部分别责任轻重，予以处分。
    人民监察委员会认为范家园转辙员刘世才，工作认真负责，发现列车分离即迅速报告，应由铁道部予以奖励。
