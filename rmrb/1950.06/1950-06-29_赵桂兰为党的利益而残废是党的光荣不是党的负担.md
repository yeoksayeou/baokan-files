　　Zhao Guilan's Disability for the Party's Interests is the Party's Glory, Not the Party's Burden
    Duan Xingcan
    Nai Dong's viewpoint is extremely harmful. Because today, within our ranks, there already exist such individuals (even if they are few or isolated): they believe that the past environment was unfavorable, causing them much suffering. And now that victory has been achieved, they feel entitled to some enjoyment, thus demanding that the Party provide care and promotions; they compare benefits, seek comfort, and become dissatisfied with the Party when their goals are not met, complaining, even engaging in corruption, degeneration, wavering, and even falling to betrayal of the Party and the revolution. This stems precisely from a failure to understand that a Communist Party member must strive for the cause of communism for life, and from using so-called "major and minor importance, as well as temporality," as excuses to handle personal interests and the interests of the Party.

    Wang Zhihong only knows that the life of an outstanding and excellent Communist Party member is precious, but he does not understand why a Communist Party member is outstanding and excellent, and why his life is precious. It is precisely because a Communist Party member strives for the ultimate liberation and lasting happiness of mankind, he lives not for his own selfish interests, but to do more work for the Party and the people. Therefore, when a conflict arises between the interests of the Party and personal interests, he can unhesitatingly obey the interests of the Party and sacrifice his own. These comrades who have lost their health or even become disabled for the cause of the Party are by no means a burden to the Party, as Zhao Guilan said, she will still use her right hand and brain to work for the Party and the people. On the contrary, those who are truly a burden to the Party are those who are constantly calculating personal gains and losses, seeking status, pursuing enjoyment, and planning solely for themselves.

    I suggest that local Party newspapers reprint the deeds of Comrade Zhao Guilan to encourage and inspire readers everywhere to make heroic and selfless struggles for the cause of the people!

　　赵桂兰为党的利益而残废是党的光荣不是党的负担

    耐冬的观点是非常有害的。因为今天在我们队伍中就已经有了这样的人（即使是少数的或个别的）：他们以为过去环境不好，使他们吃了许多苦。而今天胜利了，需要享受点了，因而要求党这样照顾那样提拔；比待遇、图舒服，达不到目的就对党不满，发牢骚甚至贪污、腐化、动摇以至堕落到背叛党与革命。这正是不懂得共产党员是要终生为共产主义事业而奋斗到底，而把个人利益和党的利益用所谓“主要性和次要性以及时间性”等借口来处理的结果。
    汪志鸿只知道一个卓越优秀的共产党员的生命是可贵的，但他不了解共产党员之所以卓越优秀，以及他的生命之所以宝贵。正是因为共产党员要为人类的最后解放与永久幸福而奋斗，他活着不是为了自己的私利，而是为着能为党为人民多做工作。因此在党的利益和个人的利益发生矛盾时，可以毫不踌躇的服从党的利益，牺牲个人。这些为党的事业失去健康甚至残废的同志对于党决不是一种负担，正如赵桂兰所说的，她还将用她的右手和脑子为党为人民工作。相反的，真正成为党的负担的倒是那些整日计较个人得失、闹地位、求享受，专为个人打算的人。
    我建议各地党报应将赵桂兰同志的事迹转载，以便鼓舞启发各地读者为人民的事业作英勇的忘我的斗争！
