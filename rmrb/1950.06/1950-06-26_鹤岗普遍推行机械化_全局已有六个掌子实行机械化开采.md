[Hegang News] Special correspondent Xu Tiemin reports: Since the Northeast Hegang Coal Mine implemented the policy of centralized working faces, centralized machinery, and centralized production in November of last year, it further concentrated pit entrances in April of this year, stopping eight inclined shafts, achieving further concentration of production management and coal mining methods, creating favorable conditions for mechanized coal mining. As of the end of May, six working faces in the mine had implemented mechanized coal mining. This is a major change in the coal mining industry.

On April 25, the mine used the 120 working face of the Second Inclined Shaft of the Dongshan No. 6 Mine as a model, and the trial mechanized coal mining method was successful. The 81 workers in the working face were divided into three shifts according to all the machinery to implement specialized division of labor. The planned daily output during the trial was 300 tons. On April 25, the first day of mechanized coal mining, the output was 366 tons. After May 18, the daily output was often maintained at around 500 tons. On June 1, the coal production has risen to 675 tons. The coal cutting machine was originally planned to advance 30 meters per hour, and it has now been increased to 45 meters. The coal production of each pneumatic pick per shift has increased from 42 tons to 84.5 tons. From May 1, the mine universally promoted the mechanized coal mining movement. As of the end of May, six working faces had implemented the mechanized coal mining method, and the output generally reached or exceeded the technical regulation of 350 tons per day. The mine also decided to carry out mechanization to twelve large working faces in June, ensuring that 80% of the overall coal production is completed by mechanized coal mining.

Since the mine implemented the mechanized coal mining method, the overall efficiency in May increased by 8.8% compared with April. The efficiency per worker increased from 0.757 tons to 0.82 tons, setting the highest record of production efficiency in the history of Hegang. If calculated by individual working faces, it is even more obvious: the average underground efficiency of the 120 working face on May 3 was 1.93 tons, and it has increased to 5.28 tons by June 1. Workers' skills are constantly improving, mechanical efficiency is fully utilized, and material consumption is greatly reduced; the 150 working face used 174 watts of explosives per ton of coal before mechanization, and only 67 watts after mechanization, a reduction of slightly less than three-fifths. The mechanized coal mining method also guarantees safe production and improves the recovery rate. The mortality rate of the mine in May decreased by 38% compared with April, and the injury rate decreased by 25%. The recovery rate of the 103 and 108 working faces increased from 50% to 80%.

Before the highly centralized production, the mine conducted sufficient preparations, detailed investigations of the status quo and reserves of each inclined shaft and working face, and studied the annual output in line with the requirements of the three-year plan, in order to complete the concentration more reasonably. The method after concentration is to extend the working face, add machines, improve efficiency, and improve coal mining methods. While implementing the mechanized coal mining method, the Soviet production chart management method was implemented, clearly stipulating that each type of worker should do a certain type of work at a certain time and at a certain location, making the labor organization more rational and the responsibilities more clear. Timely rewards, the combination of technicians and workers, the division of labor and responsibility of leading cadres to personally go to the site for specific guidance, etc., are all factors that make the mechanized coal mining method show results.

With the development of the mechanized coal mining movement, the labor organization will undergo tremendous reforms. According to the current production capacity of the mechanized coal mining working faces, the production tasks of Hegang can be completed with only twelve mechanized working faces and twenty-odd tunneling working faces. After each 300-horsepower winch in each inclined shaft gives full play to its efficiency, it can pull 1,000 to 1,200 tons. Each inclined shaft has two mechanized working faces, and the entire bureau only needs six mechanized inclined shafts and three rapid mining inclined shafts. At present, although the mine has undergone two concentrations, there are still 136 working faces (including tunneling working faces) and 22 inclined shafts in production. Therefore, after the implementation of the mechanized coal mining method, it will inevitably lead to further concentration, stopping a large number of working faces and inclined shafts. Coal miners and indirect workers on the pit can be greatly reduced. The bureau and mine leadership organizations also need to be greatly reduced. This will allow the surplus personnel to participate in other jobs, reducing the waste of manpower. At the same time, the allocation of administrative and technical management personnel for the working faces can be strengthened, so that each working face can have mining engineers, electromechanical technicians, management, statistics, cost, and material personnel, and the bureau can directly grasp the working conditions of each working face.

　　鹤岗普遍推行机械化
    全局已有六个掌子实行机械化开采
    【本报鹤岗讯】特约通讯员许铁民报道：东北鹤岗煤矿自去年十一月间实行集中掌子、集中机械、集中生产的方针后，今年四月间又进一步集中坑口，停止了八个斜井，达到生产管理及采煤方法的进一步集中，给机械化采煤创造了有利条件。系五月底止，该矿已有六个掌子实行了机械化采煤。这是煤矿工业的一个重大变革。
    四月二十五日，该矿以东山六坑二斜井一二○掌子做典型，试验机械化采煤法获得成功。该掌子八十一个工友，依照所有机械分成三班实行专业分工。试验时计划日产三百吨。四月二十五日，机械采煤第一天，即产三百六十六吨，五月十八日以后经常保持日产五百吨左右，六月一日产煤量已升达六百七十五吨。截煤机原计划每小时前进三十米，现已提高至四十五米。风镐每台每班产煤量由四十二吨提高至八十四点五吨。五月一日起，该矿即普遍推行机械化采煤运动。截至五月底止，已有六个掌子实行了机械化采煤法，产量一般达到或超过日产三百五十吨的技术规定。该矿并决定在六月份进行机械化至十二个大掌子，保证全局百分之八十的产煤量由机械化采煤来完成。
    该矿自实行机械化采煤法后，五月份全局效能较四月份提高了百分之八点八，每工能率由○点七五七吨提高到○点八二吨，创鹤岗有史以来生产效率的最高纪录。如以个别掌子计算则更为明显：一二○掌子五月三日井下效率平均为一点九三吨，至六月一日已提高到五点二八吨。工人技术不断提高，机械效能充分发挥，材料消耗大大降低；一五○掌子在机械化以前每吨煤用一七四瓦火药，机械化后只用六七瓦，降低了五分之三弱。机械化采煤法也保证了安全生产和提高了回采率。该矿死亡率，五月份较四月份减少百分之三十八，负伤率减少百分之二十五。一○三及一○八两个掌子的回采率，则由百分之五十提高到百分之八十。
    该矿在高度集中生产前，曾进行了充分的准备工作，详尽的调查了各斜井及掌子的现状及蕴藏量，并配合三年计划的要求，研究了逐年的产量，以便更合理地完成集中。集中后的办法是延长工作面，增添机器，提高效率，改善采煤方法等。实行机械化采煤法的同时，实行了苏联生产图表管理方法，明确规定了每一类工人在某一个时间、某一个地点，做某一种工作，使劳动力组织更趋合理，责任愈见分明。及时奖励，技术人员与工人结合，领导干部分工负责亲临现场具体指导等，也都是使机械化采煤法显出成绩的因素。
    随着机械化采煤运动的开展，劳动组织必将进行巨大的改革。根据目前机械化采煤掌子生产能力来计算，鹤岗的生产任务，只需十二个机械化掌子及二十几个掘进掌子即可完成。每个斜井中三百马力绞车发挥效率后可拉一千至一千二百吨。每个斜井设两个机械化掌子，全局只需六个机械化斜井及三个快采斜井。而目前，该矿虽已经过两次集中，尚有一百三十六个掌子（包括掘进掌子在内）、二十二个斜井在生产。因此，实行机械化采煤方法后，必然引起进一步集中，停止大量的掌子和斜井。采煤工人、坑上间接工等均可大大减少。局矿领导机构也需要大大减缩。这就可使多余的人员，参加到其他的岗位上去工作，而减少了人力的浪费。同时，掌子行政技术管理人员的配备可以加强，使每个掌子都可以有矿师、机电技术人员，管理、统计、成本、材料人员，局方对每个掌子工作情况也能直接掌握。
