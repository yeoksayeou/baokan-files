Xinhua News Agency, June 28th – The Central People's Government Committee held its eighth meeting at 5 PM today. The agenda included listening to Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's report on the current international situation, discussing and passing the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China, the National Emblem of the People's Republic of China, and a list of appointments.

After the meeting began, Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai reported to the meeting on the current international situation and the content of his statement regarding U.S. President Truman's declaration. The meeting held a heated discussion on this. Speakers unanimously agreed that Truman's statement thoroughly exposed the true face of American imperialism and believed that the People's Government and the people of the whole country would victoriously repel any provocation by American imperialism and liberate Taiwan and all other territories belonging to China. Committee Member Zhang Zhizhong said: "This American action has been premeditated for a long time. This action is a狂妄 provocation to the people of all Eastern nations. China and the Eastern people will resolutely counterattack. Truman's statement and the White Paper published by the U.S. State Department last year echo each other, educating and motivating the people of the whole country to unite more closely and oppose the aggression of American imperialism." Committee Member Huang Yanpei said: "The Chinese people should fully prepare their strength to repel any provocation by American imperialism. Final victory will surely belong to us, because the people's hearts are on our side, while imperialism has no masses." Committee Member Zhang Bojun said: "The U.S. government's provocation will only arouse greater anger among the Chinese people. All democratic parties and people's organizations across the country should unite more closely to oppose the provocation of American imperialism." Vice Chairman Li Jishen said: "This kind of action by the U.S. government is a completely planned action. We must solemnly express our attitude towards this act of aggression and interference in our country." Other speakers included Committee Member Li Zhuchen, Committee Member Xu Teli, and Committee Member Li Xijiu.

After a heated discussion, Chairman Mao spoke, saying: "The Chinese people have long declared that the affairs of all countries in the world should be managed by the people of each country, and the affairs of Asia should be managed by the people of Asia, and should not be managed by the United States. The United States' aggression against Asia can only arouse widespread and resolute resistance from the people of Asia. Truman declared on January 5 this year that the United States would not interfere in Taiwan, but now he himself has proven that it was false, and at the same time tore up all international agreements of the United States regarding non-interference in China's internal affairs. The United States has exposed its imperialist face in this way, which is of great benefit to the Chinese and Asian people. The United States' interference in the internal affairs of Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, and other countries is completely unreasonable. The sympathy of all the Chinese people and the sympathy of the vast majority of people in the world will stand on the side of the aggressed, and will never stand on the side of American imperialism. They will neither be tempted by the lure of imperialism nor afraid of the threat of imperialism. Imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, because it has no support from the people. The people of the whole country and the whole world unite, make full preparations, and defeat any provocation by American imperialism."

The meeting unanimously approved the content of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement.

The meeting then discussed the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, as suggested by the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. After discussion and amendment, the meeting unanimously adopted the bill.

The meeting then discussed and passed the Trade Union Law of the People'

　　中央人民政府委员会举行第八次会议
    听取周总理报告目前国际形势
    通过土地改革法工会法及国徽
    毛主席讲话，号召全国和全世界的人民团结起来，进行充分的准备，打败美帝国主义的任何挑衅。
    【新华社二十八日讯】中央人民政府委员会今天下午五时举行第八次会议，会议议程为听取周恩来总理兼外交部长关于目前国际形势的报告，讨论和通过中华人民共和国土地改革法，中华人民共和国工会法，中华人民共和国国徽和任命名单一批。
    会议开始后，周恩来总理兼外交部长向会议报告了目前的国际形势和他就美国总统杜鲁门声明所发表的声明的内容。会议就此进行了热烈的讨论。发言的人一致认为杜鲁门的声明彻底地暴露了美帝国主义的真面目，并认为人民政府和全国人民将胜利地击退美帝国主义的任何挑衅，解放台湾和其他属于中国的全部领土。张治中委员说：“美国这次行动是蓄谋已久的。这个行动是对于东方各民族人民的狂妄的挑衅。中国和东方人民将坚决地予以回击。杜鲁门的声明和去年美国国务院发表的白皮书前后呼应，将教育和激励全国人民更加团结起来，反对美帝国主义的侵略。”黄炎培委员说：“中国人民应该充分准备力量，击退美帝国主义的任何挑衅。最后的胜利定属于我们；因为人心是向着我们方面，而帝国主义则是没有群众的。”章伯钧委员说：“美国政府的挑衅只有引起中国人民更大的愤怒。全国各民主党派、各人民团体应该更加团结起来，反对美帝国主义的挑衅。”李济深副主席说：“美国政府的这种行动是完全有计划的行动。对于这种侵略和干涉我国的行动，必须严正地表示我们的态度。”其他发言的还有李烛尘委员，徐特立委员，李锡九委员等。
    在热烈讨论后，毛主席讲话说：“中国人民早已声明，全世界各国的事务应由各国人民自己来管，亚洲的事务应由亚洲人民自己来管，而不应由美国来管。美国对亚洲的侵略，只能引起亚洲人民广泛的和坚决的反抗。杜鲁门在今年一月五日还声明说美国不干涉台湾，现在他自己证明了那是假的，并且同时撕毁了美国关于不干涉中国内政的一切国际协议。美国这样地暴露了自己的帝国主义面目，这对于中国和亚洲人民很有利益。美国对朝鲜、菲律宾、越南等国内政的干涉，是完全没有道理的，全中国人民的同情和全世界广大人民的同情都将站在被侵略者方面，而决不会站在美帝国主义方面。他们将既不受帝国主义的利诱，也不怕帝国主义的威胁。帝国主义是外强中干的，因为它没有人民的支持。全国和全世界的人民团结起来，进行充分的准备，打败美帝国主义的任何挑衅。”
    会议一致同意周恩来外长的声明的内容。
    会议继就人民政协全国委员会第二次会议建议的中华人民共和国土地改革法进行讨论。会议经讨论和修改后，全体一致地通过了该法案。
    会议接着讨论和通过了中华人民共和国工会法。
    会议在讨论和通过了人民政协全国委员会建议的中华人民共和国国徽图案及各项任命名单后结束。
    出席此次会议的有中央人民政府主席毛泽东、副主席朱德、刘少奇、李济深、张澜，委员李立三、林伯渠、叶剑英、何香凝、刘伯承、吴玉章、彭真、薄一波、聂荣臻、周恩来、董必武、赛福鼎、陈嘉庚、罗荣桓、乌兰夫、徐特立、蔡畅、刘格平、马寅初、马叙伦、郭沫若、张云逸、高崇民、沈钧儒、沈雁冰、陈叔通、司徒美堂、李锡九、黄炎培、蔡廷锴、彭泽民、张治中、李章达、李烛尘、章伯钧、张奚若、陈铭枢、谭平山、张难先、柳亚子、张东荪、龙云。
