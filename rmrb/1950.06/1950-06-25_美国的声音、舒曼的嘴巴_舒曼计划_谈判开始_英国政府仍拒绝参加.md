　　The Voice of America, Schuman's Mouth
　　Negotiations on the "Schuman Plan" Begin
　　British Government Still Refuses to Participate
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] Representatives from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the West German puppet government formally began negotiations in Paris on the 20th regarding the so-called "joint management of Western European coal and steel resources" under the "Schuman Plan." The opening ceremony was personally presided over by the plan's initiator, French Foreign Minister Schuman. Actual negotiations will be conducted by national "experts." Reuters predicts that the negotiations will not conclude until late autumn.
　　According to Schuman's pronouncements at the opening ceremony, the content of the negotiations will be: (1) to draft a treaty among the countries participating in the joint management of the coal and steel industry, to establish a supranational high authority to manage the consortium; (2) to review the technical details of the consortium so that, after the treaty is ratified, it can be clarified by a series of agreements.
　　In his opening speech, Schuman spoke almost with the voice of America, and he openly admitted his intention to sell out the interests of the French people, saying: "In today's situation, national interests mean seeking various ways beyond national borders to achieve a more rational structure, achieve more economical and higher production, and achieve a broader and more accessible market." In reality, given the clear fact that France is at a disadvantage in coal and steel production, the so-called broader market can only facilitate the easier entry of West German coal and steel industries controlled by American capital.
　　The Schuman Plan negotiations have received the "blessing" of its American masters. On the day the negotiations began, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Perkins released a statement: "Wishing them success in their great efforts." However, on the other hand, although Schuman repeatedly expressed the hope that Britain would participate in the negotiations before the meeting, Britain has still not changed its decision not to participate, but only maintains contact with the French government through liaison officers to learn about the progress of the negotiations.

### 美国的声音、舒曼的嘴巴  “舒曼计划”谈判开始  英国政府仍拒绝参加

　　美国的声音、舒曼的嘴巴
    “舒曼计划”谈判开始
    英国政府仍拒绝参加
    【新华社二十三日讯】法、意、荷、比、卢五国与西德傀儡政府的代表，已于二十日起在巴黎正式开始举行关于所谓“联合经营西欧煤钢资源”的“舒曼计划”的谈判。开幕式系由该计划的创议人法国外长舒曼亲自主持。实际谈判将由各国“专家”进行。路透社预料谈判将至秋末始能结束。
    据舒曼在开幕式上宣称：谈判的内容将为：（一）拟订一项参加联合经营煤钢工业各国间的条约草案，以成立管理联营事宜的超国家的高级共同机构。（二）审查联营事宜技术上的细节，俾上述条约被批准后，得以一连串协定厘定之。
    舒曼在开幕辞中几乎是以美国的声音说话，他公开承认他的出卖法国人民利益的意图说：“在今日的局势下，民族利益就是超越国界寻求各种办法，以实现一个更为合理的机构，达到更为经济和更高的产量，实现一个更为广阔和更易进入的市场。”实际上，既然明白的事实是法国在煤钢生产上居于劣势，因此，所谓更为广阔的市场，只能便于美国资本控制下的西德煤钢工业更易进入而已。
    舒曼计划的谈判，受到了其美国主子的“祝福”，在谈判开始之日，美国助理国务卿柏金斯特发表声明：“祝福他们伟大努力的成功”。但是，另一方面，虽然舒曼在会前一再表示希望英国参加谈判，英国却仍然没有改变其不参加的决定，而只以联络员与法国政府保持接触，以获悉谈判的进程。
