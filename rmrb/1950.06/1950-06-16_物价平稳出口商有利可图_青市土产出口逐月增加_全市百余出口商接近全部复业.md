　　Stable Prices Benefit Exporters;
    Qingdao Native Produce Exports Increase Monthly
    Nearly All of the City's Hundred-Plus Exporters Have Resumed Business
    [Qingdao News] According to the Qingdao Daily, the private import and export firms in Qingdao, when organizing the export of native products and foreign exchange earnings, have seen significant monthly increases since April. The total value of goods exported in April, converted to US dollars, reached $1,626,000, exceeding the sum of the goods exported in January, February, and March by 300%. This increased to $1,683,731 in May. The export settlement figures have been increasing month by month. Taking January's export settlement as the base, February was 148%, March was 196%, April increased to 365%, and May reached 491%. The Qingdao branch of the Bank of China has vigorously organized the export of native products to support the import and export industry. In addition to providing various business conveniences, it has also provided large-scale export loans. The total number of private export loans from January to May reached over RMB 22.55401 billion, of which the loans for January, February, and March totaled 1.92934 billion yuan, while the loans for April and May increased to over 20.61081 billion yuan. The number of loans also increased from 14 in January to 93 in May. Another reason for the turnaround in export trade is the stable prices and the reasonable adjustment of exchange rates, which has enabled importers and exporters to generally obtain fixed profits. Of the city's 130-plus import and export firms, less than 80 were operating in January and February; after price stabilization, this increased to 110 in April and continued to increase to 118 in May. The gross profit on exported goods in January and February was only 15% to 20%; after the exchange rate adjustment in April, the average net profit reached 10% to 20%.
