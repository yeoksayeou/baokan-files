Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 7th. TASS, Moscow, June 4th: *Izvestia* recently published an editorial calling on working people to fight for the strict implementation of the thrift system. The editorial pointed out: The Communist Party and the Soviet government demand that we wage a tireless struggle to strive for all-out savings, that we must consolidate and develop socialist management methods, oppose wasteful phenomena that are incompatible with socialism, and use all sources that can accumulate funds to expand public wealth. Working people should protect the people's wealth as they protect their own eyes, and should carry out savings with all their might in enterprises, and should use the people's money economically. This means fighting for the further consolidation of our motherland's strength, for the prosperity and growth of the Soviet economy and culture, for the further increase of the material welfare of the working people, and for winning new victories in building a communist society.

　　消息报社论号召  严格推行节省制
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：消息报顷发表社论，号召劳动人民为严格推行节省制而斗争。社论指出：共产党与苏维埃政府要求为争取全力的节省而进行不倦的斗争，必需巩固与发展社会主义的经营方法，反对与社会主义不相容的浪费现象，利用一切可以积累资金的泉源，以扩大公有财富。劳动人民应该像保护自己的眼珠一样地来保护人民的财富，应当在企业中全力进行节省，应当经济地使用人民的金钱。这就意味着为进一步巩固我们祖国的力量、为苏维埃经济与文化的繁荣滋长、为劳动人民的物质福利的进一步增长、和为在建设共产主义社会中获取新的胜利而斗争。
