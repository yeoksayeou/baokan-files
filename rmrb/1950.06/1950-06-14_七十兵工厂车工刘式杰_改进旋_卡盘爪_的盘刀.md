　　Liu Shijie, a lathe operator at the 70th Ordnance Factory
    Improves the Disc Cutter for Rotating "Chuck Jaws"
    [This newspaper reports] Since the 70th Ordnance Factory transitioned to peaceful industry, it began producing three-jaw chucks. Over the past year, workers have demonstrated a high degree of creativity. Last year, lathe operator Fu Wanyu invented a disc cutter for rotating chuck jaws (circular, with seventy-five helical teeth), which increased product quantity sixfold and also improved quality. This March, Fu was transferred to the Municipal Party Committee Training Class for study, and this work was handed over to lathe operator Liu Shijie. Liu Shijie first realized that the teeth of this disc cutter were used to rotate the teeth of the chuck jaw, using the outer teeth for rotating and the inner teeth for polishing. This meant that the outer teeth would wear out, but the inner teeth would still be in good condition. It took ten work hours to make this type of disc cutter, and it would be discarded after rotating a maximum of two thousand chuck jaws. Some people had thought about embedding white steel blades between the outer teeth of this disc cutter, but the distance between the teeth was too small, and even if white steel blades were embedded, it would not be easy to maintain accuracy during work. Liu Shijie then considered how to ensure that all the teeth could bear force and also extend the tool's lifespan. After improvement, the inner and outer teeth of the disc cutter could bear force simultaneously, reducing vibration and doubling the lifespan of the disc cutter. Production has also increased. Previously, the highest output per work hour was sixty pieces, but now it is possible to rotate one hundred and sixty pieces per work hour, with a maximum of one hundred and eighty-five pieces. (Note: The rotating chuck jaw disc cutter is a disc cutter used for rotating "chuck jaws." Chuck jaws are a type of part on a lathe.)

　　七十兵工厂车工刘式杰
    改进旋“卡盘爪”的盘刀
    【本报讯】七十兵工厂自转为和平工业后，即开始做三爪卡盘。一年来，工人发挥了高度创造性。去年车工傅万煜发明了旋卡盘爪（圆形，上面有七十五个斜齿）的盘刀，使产品数量提高了六倍，质量也提高了。今年三月，傅调市委干训班学习，这项工作交车工刘式杰来做。刘式杰首先感到这盘刀旋卡盘爪的牙，是用外围的齿旋而用里周的齿来光，这样外围的齿使坏了，但里周的齿还很好。这种盘刀做一个需用十个工，最多旋两千块卡盘爪就废了。有些人曾想在这盘刀外围齿与齿间镶上白钢刀，但齿与齿之间距离太小，就是镶上白钢刀，工作时也不容易掌握准确。刘式杰就想怎样能使所有的齿都吃上力，同时还要工具寿命延长。经过改进，使里外周的盘刀齿同时吃力，减少振动，延长了盘刀的寿命到一倍。产量方面也提高了，以前每工最高能做六十块，现在每工能旋一百六十块，最多到一百八十五块。（按：旋卡盘爪盘刀，是旋“卡盘爪”用的盘刀。卡盘爪是车床上的一种零件。）
