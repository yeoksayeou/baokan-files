State-owned Hebei Fengfeng Coal Mine Tongshun Well
Successfully Trials New Coal Mining Method

[This newspaper reported] The Tongshun Well, belonging to the state-owned Hebei Fengfeng Coal Mine, officially began implementing the three-layer longwall retreating zonal filling and centralized mining method on May 18th after thorough publicity and meticulous preparation. It began recovery on May 31st with good results.

In the past, the Fengfeng Coal Mine had always used the old-fashioned residual pillar caving method for mining, resulting in numerous and scattered working faces, leading to a low recovery rate of 35% to 55%. Furthermore, the roadways were difficult to maintain, increasing repair costs and the consumption of pit props, which in turn increased costs. In terms of safety, it was difficult to control ventilation, posing dangers such as spontaneous combustion and roof collapse injuries, adding considerable difficulties and suffering to the workers during the mining process.

In order to implement the resolution of the First National Coal Mine Conference in November of last year on improving coal mining methods, the North China Coal Mine Administration specifically organized administrative responsible cadres and technicians from various state-owned coal mines in North China to visit the Northeast in February of this year. The representatives from Fengfeng vividly introduced the benefits of the new mining methods implemented by the Hegang Coal Mine in the Northeast, which increased production and improved safety work, arousing the attention of the mine's workers. However, the ideological concerns of general technicians and workers remained serious. The mine's management committee took cautious and steady steps, conducting planned publicity and educational work and preparation. They patiently helped the groups to conduct research and discussions, explaining to the workers with theory and the facts from the Northeast. At the same time, they opened short-term training courses, absorbing 104 people, including those who visited the Northeast, production activists, experienced Party and Youth League members, technicians, and workers to participate in the training; and made models of the new coal mining methods for explanation. The management committee also publicly guaranteed to install new-style machines, making the installation as simple as possible, and guaranteeing that the parts for the machinery would be fully prepared, repaired as soon as they broke down, and would not delay production. From then on, the workers gradually increased their confidence and accepted the new coal mining methods.

After careful research, the management committee decided to use Tongshun Well as a pilot project, and decided to use the area between 40 meters and 60 meters from the left sixth road to the left fifth road of the seventh winch lane as the new method recovery location. Thus, various preparation works began, first modifying the old roadways according to the needs of the new method, installing machines, improving the ventilation system, arranging the working face of the new coal mining method, and preparing the initial filling materials.

When the preparatory work was ready, some workers were concerned that the efficiency may be low during the trial period, affecting their wages (Editor's note: The mine uses piece-rate wages). The mine immediately announced that before a certain standard for the quota was available, it would guarantee that wages during the trial period would not be less than the original average wage. And it requested that a standard for the quota be actively sought without violating the principles of safety.

On May 18th, Tongshun Well officially began the trial implementation of the new mining method. Because the results were not good, the organization was changed again, the distribution of machinery and tools was adjusted, and the work plan was revised, so that the new method of coal mining could proceed smoothly. Since May 22nd, within nine days, not only has the recovery work of the new method been fully launched, but also the most difficult initial filling project has been done very well, and the recovery has officially begun on May 31st. During this period, there was not a single work-related injury. The successful trial of the new coal mining method encouraged all the mine workers, who asked the mine leaders to universally use the new mining method for production. The well has now been designated as one of the key points for the trial implementation of the new coal mining method in state-owned coal mines in North China. Until the end of September, it will continue to test and implement a series of work after the new coal mining method is implemented, in order to learn from experience and promote the mine.

### 国营河北峰峰煤矿通顺井  试行新式采煤法成功

　　国营河北峰峰煤矿通顺井
    试行新式采煤法成功
    【本报讯】国营河北峰峰煤矿所属通顺井，经过深入的宣传和周密的准备工作，于五月十八日正式开始实行三层长壁后退带状充填集中采煤方法，五月三十一日已开始回采，成绩良好。
    过去峰峰煤矿在开采方法上，一向是使用旧式残柱陷落法采煤，工作面多而分散，致使回采率低到百分之三十五至五十五。又因巷道难以维持，修理费及坑木使用量均增多，致使成本提高。且在保安上不易控制通风，有自然发火以及冒顶伤人等危险，给职工们在开采过程中，增加不少的困难和痛苦。
    为贯彻去年十一月第一次全国煤矿会议关于改进采煤方法的决议，华北煤矿管理局于今年二月间特组织华北各国营煤矿的行政负责干部、技术人员去东北参观。峰峰代表回矿后，生动地介绍了东北鹤岗煤矿实行新开采方法，对提高生产和改善保安工作的好处，引起了该矿职工的注意。但一般技术人员和职工的思想顾虑仍然是严重的。该矿管委会即采取了慎重稳健的步骤，有计划的进行宣传教育和准备工作。他们耐心的帮助小组进行研究讨论，以理论和东北的事实向职工进行解释。同时又开设短期训练班，吸收去东北参观的人员，生产积极而有经验的党、团员，技术人员及工人等一百零四名参加训练；并制造了新采煤方法的模型，进行讲解。管委会并公开提出保证，安装新式机器，尽可能装设简单，并保证将机械的零件准备齐全，随坏随修，不误生产。从此，职工渐渐提高了信心，接受了新的采煤方法。
    管委会经过慎重的研究，决定以通顺井作试点，并决定在七号绞车道左六路至左五路间工作面四十米至六十米之处，为试验新法回采地点。于是各项准备工作开始进行，首先是按新法需要修改旧巷道，装添机器，改进通风系统，布置新采煤法的工作面，准备首次充填材料等。
    当准备工作就绪时，有些工友又顾虑到在试行期间可能效率低，影响工资（编者按：该矿为计件工资）。矿方当即宣布了在定额未有一定标准前，保证试行期间，工资绝不少于原平均工资。并要求在不违反保安的原则下，积极寻找定额标准。
    五月十八日，通顺井正式试行新法开采，因成绩不佳，又经改变组织，调整机械和工具分配，以及修正工作计划，才使新法采煤得以顺利进行。自五月二十二日起，在九天内，不但将新方法回采工作全面展开，而且最困难的首次充填工程亦作得很好，三十一日已正式开始回采。在此期间内没有发生一次公伤。新采煤方法的试验成功，鼓舞了全矿职工，纷纷向该矿领导要求，普遍运用新开采方法进行生产。现该井已被定为华北国营煤矿试行新采煤方法的重点之一，至九月底止，将继续试验实行新采煤方法后的一系列的工作，以便吸取经验，推广矿。    （中央燃料部通讯小组·陈扬）
