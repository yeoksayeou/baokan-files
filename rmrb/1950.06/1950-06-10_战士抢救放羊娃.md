Soldier Rescues Shepherd Boy
    Zhao Chunbao
    This is the story of an old soldier from the Battle of Huailai Frontline during the Liberation War. In this quiet wilderness, only the soldiers of the Eighth Company are planting peanuts, chatting and laughing.

    Suddenly, a "boom" of explosion came from the north. The soldiers looked in surprise towards the small mound to the north. Platoon Leader Xu said, "Is someone throwing a grenade?" They immediately ran to the small mound, and saw a shepherd boy of fifteen or sixteen years old, hurriedly driving a flock of sheep towards the village to the north. He looked back at the soldiers and shouted in fear, "Dead! Dead!" The soldiers looked around and saw two dead sheep lying straight not far from the earthen slope; beside the dead sheep, a child was lying. The soldiers rushed to the child as if charging. It turned out that the child was injured by a landmine buried by the Kuomintang bandit troops before they were annihilated. His clothes were blown to pieces, his body was covered in blood, his head was on the ground, and his feet were kicking. Communist Party member Guo Junjie recalled how he had herded sheep for the landlord in the deep water during the continuous rainy season since he was ten years old, and suffered from leg sores that have not yet healed. His eyes moistened. He couldn't help bending down to stroke the child's head. The child raised his head, opened his eyes, looked at Guo Junjie, and cried out, "Comrade, save me!" Then his head was tightly pressed to the ground again. At this time, Guo Junjie found that the child's right hand had been blown off, and fresh blood was pouring out. He quickly took off his own trousers and tightly and skillfully bandaged the child's bleeding half-arm. The wind blew, and the soil and sand flew, making it impossible to open one's eyes. Guo Junjie was afraid that the child would get tetanus, so he quickly bandaged his injured legs. Comrade Zhao Jishan also panted and brought the "basket" in which they were holding peanut seeds, as a temporary "stretcher," and took their cotton clothes to spread on it, just like arranging a place for wounded comrades.

    Comrade Guo Junjie leaned over the child's face and asked, "Which village are you from?" The child replied in a weak voice, "Duokouying." "How old are you?" "Fourteen." Guo Junjie had been on the battlefield, and he knew that when moving the wounded onto the stretcher, talking to the wounded could reduce the unbearable pain. So he talked while gently lifting the child onto the "stretcher." The soldiers carried him carefully, and the child gritted his teeth in pain. Comrade Guo Junjie comforted him and said, "Don't worry! Go to the hospital to get medicine, and it won't hurt after you get the medicine… We're almost to the village, and we'll change you to a better stretcher when we get to the village."

    When they arrived at the village, they gently placed the "stretcher" on a flat place and immediately went to find a door panel. The villagers all gathered around. The child's mother rushed over like a madwoman. Seeing that her child was seriously injured, she fell to the ground with a thud. The villagers quickly carried her home.

    After changing to a stretcher, the soldiers sent the child to the hospital of the army and settled him down. When they were about to leave, the child said reluctantly, "My name is Feng Jinquan. I will never forget your kindness! Comrade! What's your name?"

    When the soldiers returned to the company, the village cadres of Duokouying had already brought a "report of merit" letter. They were narrating the incident to the company cadres.

　　战士抢救放羊娃
    赵春保
    这是解放战争中怀来前线保卫战的老战士。在这静静的原野上，只有八连几个战士边说边笑地在点种花生。
    突然，从北边传来了“轰隆”的爆炸声。战士们都惊异地向北边小墩上望去。徐排长说：“不是谁在打手榴弹吧？”他们立刻都跑到那小土墩上，只见一个十五六岁的放羊娃，慌慌张张地赶着一群羊向北边的村里走。他回头看了看战士们，惶恐地喊：“死了！死了！”战士们往四周一望，看见离土坡不远，直挺挺的躺着两只死绵羊；死绵羊的一边，躺着一个孩子。战士们像冲锋似地飞跑到孩子跟前。原来这孩子被国民党匪军在被歼前埋下的地雷炸伤了。他的衣服被炸得稀烂，满身血淋淋的，头顶住地，两只脚在蹬踏。共产党员郭俊杰同志回想起自己从十岁起，在连阴的雨季里，踏着膝盖深的水给地主放羊，而害了至今尚未痊愈的连疮腿的情景，他的眼睛润湿了。他情不自禁地弯下腰去抚摸孩子的头。孩子抬了抬头，睁开眼，看了看郭俊杰，就哭着喊：“同志，救命！”接着他的头又紧紧地贴着地。这时郭俊杰发现孩子的右手已被炸掉，鲜血在倾注。他赶快脱下自己的单裤，紧张而熟练地为小孩绑扎流着血的半截手臂。风刮起来，土沙飞扬，使人睁不开眼。郭俊杰同志怕这孩子受了破伤风，又赶紧代他绑扎受伤的两条腿。赵计山同志也气喘喘地把他们盛花生种的菠箩拿来，作为临时“担架”，并把他们的棉衣拿来，和安置受伤的战友一样给他铺好。
    郭俊杰同志俯在孩子的脸上问：“你是啥村的？”孩子声音细弱地回答：“垛口营。”“多大啦？”“十四岁。”郭俊杰上过战场，他懂得当把伤员移到担架上去的时候，和伤员说话，能减少伤员疼痛难忍的感觉。他就这样一边谈着，一边把孩子轻轻地抬到“担架”上。战士们小心谨慎地抬着，那孩子痛的直咬牙。郭俊杰同志安慰他说：“别着急！到医院里去给你上药，上了药就不疼啦。……快到村里了，到村里给你换好担架。”
    抬到村里，他们轻轻地把“担架”放到平坦的地方，马上去找门板。村里人都围拢来了。孩子的妈妈像疯了似的赶来。一见她的孩子伤势很重，就咚的一声昏倒在地上。老乡们赶紧把她抬回家去。
    换了担架，战士们把孩子送到部队的医院里安置好。当他们要回来时，孩子恋恋不舍的说：“我叫冯金全。我忘不了你们的恩情！同志！你叫啥？”
    当战士们回到连上，垛口营的村干部，已带来一封“报功”信。他们正在和连干部叙述这件事情的经过。
