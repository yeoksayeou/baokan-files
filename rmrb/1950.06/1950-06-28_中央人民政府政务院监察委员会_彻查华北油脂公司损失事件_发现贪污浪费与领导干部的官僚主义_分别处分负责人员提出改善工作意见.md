　　Central People's Government, Government Administration Council, Supervisory Committee
    Thoroughly Investigates Losses at North China Oil Company
    Discovers Embezzlement, Waste, and Bureaucracy of Leading Cadres
    Punishes Responsible Personnel Accordingly, and Proposes Suggestions for Improvement
    [This Newspaper's Report] Regarding the event of the North China Oil Company damaging a large quantity of vegetable oil, which was successively revealed by the Tianjin Daily and this newspaper, the People's Supervisory Committee of the Central People's Government, together with the Ministry of Trade, sent personnel to the North China Oil Company for a thorough investigation. The cause of the oil damage was clarified, and embezzlement and waste were discovered within the company. The Supervisory Committee has now drafted its handling opinions, which have been approved by the Government Administration Council.

    Oil Damage and Embezzlement and Waste: Loss of Over 1 Million Jin of Millet
    The North China Oil Company was formerly the Oil Department of the North China Foreign Trade Company. From the Oil Department period onwards, a total of more than 4.3 million jin of oil was damaged, accounting for over 12% of the total incoming goods. After refining, some of it could be used, but the net loss was more than 550,000 jin. Together with other waste in purchasing, storage, and transportation, and individual embezzlement, the total loss exceeded 1.79 million jin of millet.

    Leading Cadres Exhibit Bureaucracy: No Plans, No Systems, Little Inspection
    The cause of the loss was partly due to the fact that the oils purchased by the various branch companies were handmade products that did not meet the standards; but mainly due to the bureaucracy of the company's leadership. Yun Si, the first Deputy Manager and Head of Processing and Storage (Manager during the Oil Department period), did not utilize his considerable technical skills and turned a blind eye to the various problems that occurred in processing and storage. Li Guangjun, the Manager of the Oil Company, who was originally the Deputy Manager of the North China Foreign Trade Company during the Oil Department period, directly led the Oil Department and was not alert to the chaotic phenomena in the department. After the establishment of the Oil Company, he served as Manager, busy with affairs all day long, but failing to grasp the center of work. The company's entire work lacked complete plans and sound systems. Leading cadres conducted few inspections of the work, and even when problems were discovered, they were not dealt with in a timely manner. For example, when the Oil Company was established, the leadership failed to fulfill its responsibility for handover and inventory. During the Oil Department period, bad oil accounted for 19% of the total revenue, and no active refining or disposal was carried out. After the establishment of the Oil Company, another million jin of bad oil was continued to be received. There were no plans for storing the oil, and rainwater leaked in, causing more than 600,000 jin of vegetable oil to spoil. Due to delays in unloading trains, oils shipped from other locations were repeatedly fined, incurring a total of over 12 million yuan in demurrage and storage fees. In procurement, due to the lack of a sound system, the purchase of lead wire, wooden screens, and motorcycles exceeded the market price by more than 77,000 jin of millet; the purchase of wood resulted in a loss of 18 million yuan. Furthermore, Shang Qingming, a secretary in the Business Department, violated the central government's foreign exchange management policy and handed over a sum of foreign exchange to a private bank that was not allowed to operate in foreign exchange, which Xu Roma, the Deputy Director of the Business Department, blindly approved. Dong Junmin, the Director of the Business Department, knew about this matter but did not actively stop it, and afterwards pretended not to "know," and tried to shirk responsibility by saying he was "not familiar with business and policies."

    Failure to Implement Superior Instructions, Failure to Listen to Lower-Level Opinions
    Secondly, the company's leading cadres failed to implement superior instructions and failed to listen to lower-level opinions. For example, the higher authorities approved the construction of three sheds for storing oil, but only one was built. The higher authorities gave him the task of regulating the market, but he did not make specific sales plans. Fan Yongzhong, the second Deputy Manager of the Oil Company, reported the company's situation to the Administration Bureau three times, but the figures reported were inconsistent. He said, "Now no one can summarize the situation of the Oil Company." Not only did he not pay attention to problems and opinions reflected by subordinates, but Manager Li Guangjun instead said that "comrades' thinking is one-sided and narrow," and Deputy Manager Fan Yongzhong said it was "nitpicking."

    Neglecting Ideological Leadership of Cadres, Failing to Pay Attention to Reforming Old Personnel
    Thirdly, the company's leadership simply emphasized the cultural level and technology of cadres, neglecting ideological leadership, especially neglecting the education and transformation of old personnel. Individual cadres in charge of leadership responsibilities made a fuss about their positions and emotions. Li Yue, who initially served as the military representative of the Oil Department and later as the Deputy Manager of the Oil Department, expressed dissatisfaction with the position of Deputy Manager, adopted an antagonistic attitude towards higher authorities, and was excessively accommodating to lower levels. Fan Yongzhong, the second Deputy Manager of the Oil Company, also did not actively assist the Manager in performing his duties but made a fuss about his personal position. The repeated embezzlement and fraud committed by a few old personnel were also not inspected and dealt with. Pang Chunrui, a staff member of the Procurement Section, often borrowed salary to support his family before becoming a procurement officer; after serving as a procurement officer, his life suddenly became wealthy, and he often invited the Section Chief of his section to dinner. The leadership did not pay attention to this. As a result, according to Pang's own confession, he embezzled nearly 5.7 million yuan. Shen Guoliang, an clerk in the Storage and Transportation Section, falsely reported the number of workers and embezzled more than 900,000 yuan of public funds. Zhang Qingxiang, an accountant in the Business Department, exposed market conditions and attempted to collude with private merchants to engage in speculation and fraud, but no active prevention was taken.

    Relevant Responsible Personnel to be Punished Accordingly
    Due to the above circumstances, the people's property has suffered great losses, which has affected the unity of the company's cadres and the development of its business. The Supervisory Committee analyzed the responsibilities of the relevant personnel and decided to impose the following punishments: First Deputy Manager Yun Si is removed from his current position; Manager Li Guangjun is given two major demerits; Second Deputy Manager Fan Yongzhong is given one major demerit; Deputy Director of the Business Department Xu Roma is demoted; Director of the Business Department Dong Junmin is given a warning; Li Yue, the former Deputy Manager of the Oil Department (currently the Manager of the Beijing Oil Branch), is given one minor demerit. The relevant responsible cadres of the North China Trade Corporation, especially the North China Foreign Trade Corporation, are instructed to conduct self-criticism. In addition, Pang Chunrui, Zhang Qingxiang, and Shen Guoliang, who were guilty of embezzlement and dereliction of duty, were dismissed from their posts or given major demerits, the embezzled money was recovered, and Pang Chunrui was sent to the court for prosecution.

    During the investigation, Huo Weisheng, Xuan Long, Li Yamin, Meng Gufeng, Wu Ying and other five employees of the company were conscientious and responsible in their inspection. The Supervisory Committee suggested that the China Oil Company give them appropriate commendation.

    Through this investigation, the outstanding cases were resolved, the business level of the Oil Company was improved, the cadres were educated, and their attention was drawn to the importance of state property, and other specialized companies were alerted. Finally, the Supervisory Committee also put forward three specific suggestions for improving the company's future work.

　　中央人民政府政务院监察委员会
    彻查华北油脂公司损失事件
    发现贪污浪费与领导干部的官僚主义
    分别处分负责人员提出改善工作意见
    【本报讯】关于天津日报及本报先后揭载的华北油脂公司损坏大量植物油的事件，中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会曾会同贸易部派人前往华北油脂公司彻查。查明了油类损坏的原委，并发现该公司有贪污浪费现象。监委会现已拟具处理意见，并经政务院批准。
    油类损坏与贪污浪费  损失小米一百余万斤
    华北油脂公司前身为华北对外贸易公司油脂部。自油脂部时期起，前后共损坏油类四百三十余万斤，占进货总额的百分之十二强。除经提炼后一部分可供使用外，净损失五十五万余斤。加上采购储运工作中的其他浪费和个别人员的贪污，损失总数超过小米一百七十九万斤。
    领导干部有官僚主义  无计划无制度少检查
    造成损失的原因，一方面是各分支公司所购油类是手工产品，不合标准；但主要是由于该公司领导上的官僚主义。油脂公司第一副理兼加工储运部长恽思（油脂部时期任经理），不发挥其颇强的技术能力，对加工储运中发生的种种问题，熟视无睹。油脂公司经理李光军，油脂部时期原任华北对外贸易公司副理，直接领导油脂部，对该部所有紊乱现象毫无警觉。油脂公司成立后，他任经理，一天到晚忙于事务，抓不紧工作中心。油脂公司的全部工作无完整的计划，缺乏健全的制度。领导干部对工作少检查，发现了问题也不及时处理。如油脂公司成立时，领导上未尽接交清点责任。油脂部时期坏油占总收入量百分之十九，没有积极加以精炼与处理，油脂公司成立后又继续收入坏油一百余万斤。保管油脂无计划，漏进雨水，使六十余万斤植物油变坏。外埠运来油类屡因卸火车延期被罚，前后共付延期费及屯存费一千二百余万元。在采购上，因无健全制度，买铅丝、板筛、摩托车三项，超过市价小米七万七千余斤；买木料损失一千八百万元。又如业务部秘书尚庆铭，违犯中央管理外汇政策，将一笔外汇交给不允许经营外汇的私人银行办理，该公司业务部副部长徐罗马竟盲目批准。业务部长董俊民明知此事，既不积极制止，事后还装作“不知道”，又以“对业务和政策不太熟悉”来推卸责任。
    不执行上级指示  不听取下层意见
    其次，该公司领导干部，不执行上级指示，不听取下层意见。如上级批准搭盖保管油类的天棚三个，只搭了一个。上级给以调剂市场的任务，他亦未作具体销售的计划。油脂公司第二副理范永中，曾三次至管理局汇报公司情况，所报数目字前后不符。他说：“现在谁也归纳不出油脂公司的情况来。”对下级反映问题、提供意见，不但不加注意，经理李光军反说是“同志们思想片面狭隘”，副理范永中则说是“吹毛求疵”。
    忽视干部思想领导  不注意改造旧人员
    第三，该公司领导上单纯强调干部的文化程度和技术，忽视政治思想上的领导，特别是忽视了对旧人员的教育改造。个别负领导责任的干部闹地位、闹情绪。初任油脂部军代表，继任油脂部副理的李越，对副理职务表示不满，对上级采取对抗态度，对下层则过分迁就。油脂公司第二副理范永中，也不积极协助经理执行职务而为个人地位闹情绪。少数旧人员屡犯贪污舞弊，也未检查处理。采购科科员庞春瑞，在未任采购员以前，时常借薪来供应家庭；担任采购员后，生活突然富裕了，还经常请本科科长吃饭。领导上竟未加以注意。结果，据庞自己供认，前后贪污近五百七十万元。储运科办事员沈国良，虚报工人数额，贪污公款九十余万元。业务部会计张庆祥，暴露行情，企图勾结私商，投机舞弊，也未积极加以防范。
    有关负责人员  分别予以处分
    由于以上情况，人民财产受到很大损失，影响了该公司干部的团结与业务的开展。监察委员会分析了各有关人员应负的责任，决定分别予以处分：第一副理恽思撤现职；经理李光军记大过二次；第二副理范永中记大过一次；业务部副部长徐罗马降级；业务部长董俊民处警告一次；原任油脂部副理李越（现任北京油脂分公司经理）记小过一次。华北贸易总公司，特别是华北对外贸易公司有关负责干部，着其自行检讨。此外，贪污失职的庞春瑞、张庆祥与沈国良，分别撤职或予以记大过处分，追回赃款，庞春瑞并送法院究办。
    在清查中，该公司职工霍维胜、宣龙、李亚民、孟古风、吴颖等五人，认真负责检查，监委会建议由中国油脂公司予以适当表扬。
    经过此次清查，解决了悬案，提高了油脂公司的业务水平，也教育了干部，引起他们对国家财产的重视，并使其他专业公司知所警惕。最后，监委会为改进该公司今后工作，还提出了三项具体意见。
