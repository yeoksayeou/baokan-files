　　Baoding Adjusts Public-Private Relations: Private Sector Improves After Support

　　[Report from our newspaper in Baoding] To help private industry and commerce overcome current production and sales difficulties, the Baoding Municipal People's Government and state-owned specialized companies have adopted a series of active measures in accordance with the central government's policy of overall consideration and adjustment of industry and commerce. From June 4th to 6th, the Municipal Government convened a joint meeting of the Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and other departments, conducted an in-depth analysis and study of the current situation of private industry and commerce, and formed a "Private Industry and Commerce Production Work Committee" to specifically promote and guide production in the private sector. On June 9th, a mobilization meeting was held for more than 200 people, including members of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, directors and secretaries of various industries, and managers of larger businesses. Mayor Kang Xiumin spoke, mobilizing everyone to find all means to overcome temporary difficulties, actively improve management, and develop production. Now it is being mobilized and implemented industry by industry.

　　According to the current situation, the Baoding Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has supported 4,000 looms in the disaster areas of Gaoyang, Anxin, Lixian, and Renqiu. They can weave 2,000 bolts of cloth per day, earning 56,000 catties of red sorghum in processing fees. In this way, the Baoding weaving industry was helped to overcome the off-season.

　　The Hebei Provincial Company of the Department Store has also established consignment relationships with private stores such as Demao Long and Yuan Feng. Active adjustments have also been made to prices. From mid-March to mid-May, the difference between wholesale and retail prices of various companies was very small, or even non-existent. Adjustments began in late May, raising the retail price to 4% to 8% higher than the wholesale price. On June 5th, another adjustment was made, increasing it from 8% to 17%. The Grain Company increased it from 4% to 5% and is preparing to increase it again. This has allowed private industry and commerce to obtain a certain profit.

　　From late May to June 7th, the Hebei Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China has successively extended loans of 1.1 billion yuan to 111 households in 18 industries in Baoding, such as oil pressing, weaving, and soy sauce; and appropriately lowered interest rates, greatly facilitating the turnover of funds for private industry and commerce, and enabling many industries to start operating. For example, after six paint industry households borrowed 15 million yuan, they jointly went to Tianjin and Hankou to purchase paint. Nine hemp rope industry households also organized long-distance joint purchases to buy raw materials in Chahar. The weaving industry is also brewing the organization of long-distance sales. Fifteen electrical appliance households formed the Electrical Appliance Joint Store and began to buy raw materials in Tianjin. Seventeen brick kiln households organized a purchasing and sales committee. Other soy sauce and pig bristle industries are organizing joint operations to solve production and sales problems.

　　保定调整公私关系
    私营行业经过扶植开始好转
    【本报保定讯】保定市人民政府及国营各专业公司，为扶助私营工商业度过目前产销困难，根据中央统筹兼顾、调整工商业的方针，采取了一系列的积极措施。六月四日到六日，市府召开了中共市委、市工会、市团工委、工商联等部门联席会，对目前私营工商业的情况，进行了深刻的分析研究，并组成了“私营工商业生产工作委员会”，专门推动和指导私营行业进行生产。六月九日又召开了全市工商联合会委员、各行业主任、秘书及较大商户经理二百余人的动员大会，康修民市长讲话，动员大家想一切办法，度过暂时困难，积极改善经营，发展生产。现在正分行分业动员贯彻。
    中国花纱布公司保定分公司根据目前情况，在高阳、安新、蠡县、任邱等地灾区对织布业扶植了四千张机子。每天能织布二千匹，得加工费五万六千斤红粮。这样，就扶植保定织布业度过了背月。
    百货公司河北省公司，亦与德茂隆、源丰等私营商店建立了代销关系。并对价格积极进行了调整。三月中旬到五月中旬，各公司批发和零售价格差额很小，甚至并无差额，五月下旬开始调整，使零售价高于批发价百分之四到百分之八。六月五日再次调整，由百分之八提到百分之十七。粮食公司由百分之四提到百分之五，还准备再度提高。这就使私营工商业获得了一定利润。
    中国人民银行河北省分行营业部，从五月下旬到六月七日止，先后对保市榨油、织布、酱等十八个行业、一百一十一户放款十一亿元；并适当降低利率，大大便利了私营工商业资金的周转，使不少行业开始活动起来。如油漆业六户，贷款一千五百万元后，即联合起来到天津、汉口购买油漆。麻绳业九户也组织长途联购，到察南买原料。织布业亦正酝酿组织长途远销。电业十五户组成了电业联营总店，开始到天津买原料。砖窑业十七户组织了购销委员会。其它酱业、猪毛业，均在组织联营，解决产销问题。
