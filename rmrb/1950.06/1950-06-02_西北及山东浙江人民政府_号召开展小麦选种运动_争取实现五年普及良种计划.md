　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

　　The wheat in the Northwest region is already at the milky ripe stage, and the harvest is imminent. To this end, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northwest Military and Political Committee issued instructions on conducting wheat seed selection, calling on governments at all levels in the region to lead farmers in conjunction with the summer harvest to conscientiously carry out seed selection and gradually achieve the five-year plan for popularizing improved varieties. The instructions also require that for the improved wheat varieties that have been promoted in the past, field inspections should be carried out before the wheat harvest, and indoor inspections should be carried out after the harvest.
　　In order to carry out the wheat seed selection work, the department dispatched seed selection personnel to the Guangji District People's Government in Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, to convene a seed selection symposium with local veteran farmers. The heads of Jinghui Farm and Sanyuan Agricultural Extension Station also attended. After discussion, the symposium proposed that each village in the district should form a seed selection committee based on production teams, inviting experienced farmers and staff from farms and extension stations to lead the masses in seed selection, with the district people's government responsible for inspection. Currently, each village in the district is holding mobilization meetings for seed selection, publicizing the importance and methods of seed selection, and launching and organizing seed selection competitions between villages and households, striving to ensure that each household can select enough seeds for all their wheat fields for the coming year.
　　The Shandong Provincial People's Government also issued instructions a few days ago, requiring governments at all levels in the old and new areas of the province to make specific plans according to local characteristics, establish seed selection committees at all levels, mobilize and organize all possible forces to lead the masses in carrying out and promoting the seed selection movement. The instructions made the following provisions for seed selection methods: Before the wheat matures, the village seed selection committee should lead and organize farmers to evaluate the good varieties in the village. Before harvesting, they should guide farmers to remove impurities, inferior plants, and diseased plants from the selected good varieties, implement separate harvesting, separate threshing, and separate storage, and mobilize the masses to select seeds locally. At the same time, the village seed selection committee should also be responsible for registering the good varieties selected in the village and the quantity required for autumn planting in the whole village, so as to facilitate the adjustment of good varieties in the future. After threshing, the village seed selection committee will send the selected good varieties (three catties of seeds and thirty specimen plants) along with the village seed selection registration form to the county seed selection committee to participate in the county's good variety competition. The county seed selection committee will select the county's good varieties, which will be collected and exchanged by the county government and handed over to the farms and the village seed retention land (the number of seed retention land should be sufficient for the whole village to exchange varieties) for breeding, for promotion in the village next year. Other good varieties selected by the village will be mobilized by the village seed selection committee for local exchange, for sowing this autumn. In addition, the work of promoting good varieties must also be evaluated by the village and county and opinions from the masses should be sought as much as possible. All excellent varieties that have been inspected and approved should be collected and exchanged by seed companies or farms with additional rewards for breeding and promotion.
　　The Shandong Provincial People's Government has also appointed Ai Chunan, Director of the Provincial Department of Industry, and eleven others to form the Shandong Provincial Good Variety Popularization Committee to start the work of popularizing good varieties. The committee also plans to purchase 11 million catties of wheat promotion seeds this year for promotion in various places. Seed selection committees at the prefectural, county, district, and village levels throughout the province have also been established one after another, and will soon mobilize the masses to launch a wheat seed selection movement before the wheat harvest. The Shandong Provincial Department of Industry has dispatched ninety-three agricultural technicians to Xuzhou, Tai'an, Zou County, Wendeng, Licheng and other regions to assist these regions in carrying out seed selection work.
　　[Hangzhou News] The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Industry issued the "Specific Arrangement Methods for Launching the Wheat Seed Selection Movement" on the 10th, deciding to focus on Hangzhou, Hang County, Lin'an, Jiaxing, Jinhua, Lanxi, Shaoxing, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Songyang nine counties and one city this year. The county and city are responsible for promotion, and seed selection committees or seed selection groups are established under the production committees at the county (city), township, and village levels. The county (city) industrial departments are the main body, absorbing farms, seed management stations, agricultural associations, agricultural schools, and other relevant agricultural research and education institutions, as well as farmers with production experience and technical cadres to form a team to strengthen leadership and preside over the evaluation work at the county (city), township, and village levels respectively. The evaluation method is mainly based on the needs of the local masses, according to the amount of harvest, the severity of diseases and insect pests, the variety and the strength of the base and the resistance to humidity, drought, and wind. The wheat seeds that have passed the evaluation will be retained and promoted by the technical cadres of the county (city) agricultural departments, farms, and seed stations, as well as local technical experts and production activists in appropriate areas, encouraging the masses to exchange seeds with each other, or to collect and exchange with public grain, and to breed them on farms or specially appointed farmers in each district and township. At the same time, the industrial departments and farms in each special zone should jointly select disease-resistant varieties with the masses in areas where rust disease is serious, and purchase and adjust them if necessary.
　　[Xi'an News] According to the Masses Daily, the Jinghui Farm of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the Sanyuan Agricultural Extension Station of Shaanxi Province, in order to carry out wheat seed selection work, specially collaborated with the Guangji District Government of Jingyang County to launch a symposium for village chiefs and veteran farmers in the district on the 18th of this month. After discussion, it was decided that: (1) Each village should form a seed selection committee based on production teams, and invite experienced farmers or staff from farms and extension stations to lead the masses in seed selection work, with the district government responsible for inspection. (2) Each village should hold a mobilization meeting for seed selection to publicize seed selection methods and launch a seed selection competition between villages and households. Labor models for seed selection will be elected before the wheat harvest next year. (3) In order to take care of the shortage of labor during the harvest, women should be vigorously mobilized to go to the fields for seed selection. (4) Each household should select at least enough seeds for all their wheat fields next year. Seed selection methods: 1. For those who plant improved wheat varieties from farms, they can select a piece of wheat land that grows vigorously, neatly, without diseases and insect pests, and with fewer weeds for separate harvesting and storage. 2. Ordinary wheat varieties can be carefully selected with large ears, strong stalks, full grains, and no diseases and insect pests for separate threshing and storage.

　　西北及山东浙江人民政府
    号召开展小麦选种运动
    争取实现五年普及良种计划
    【本报讯】新华社息：西北地区小麦已经乳熟，收割在即。为此西北军政委员会农林部特发出关于进行小麦选种的指示，号召该区各级人民政府领导农民，结合夏收，认真进行选种，逐步实现五年普及良种的计划。指示并要求，对于以往曾经推广的优良麦种，在麦收前要进行田间检查，收获后进行室内检定。
    该部为展开小麦选种工作，曾派遣选种人员至陕西泾阳县广吉区人民政府，召集当地老农举行选种座谈会。泾惠农场和三原农业推广站负责人亦前往参加。经过讨论后，座谈会提出：该区各村应以生产小组为基础组成选种委员会，邀集选种有经验的农民和农场、推广站工作人员领导群众进行选种，由区人民政府负责检查。现该区各村正分别召开选种动员大会，宣传选种的重要和方法，发动和组织村与村、户与户间的选种竞赛运动，争取每户均能选够自己麦田明年所需的全部种子。
    山东省人民政府亦于日前发布指示，要求全省新老地区各级政府，按照当地的不同特点，作出具体计划，成立各级选种委员会，动员组织一切可能参加的力量，去领导群众开展和推广选种运动。指示对选种办法作了如下的规定：在小麦成熟前，村选种委员会应领导组织农民评出村中良种，收割前则要指导农民将所评良种去杂、去劣、去病株，实行单收、单打、单藏、发动群众就地选种。同时，村选种委员会还应负责登记村选良种及全村秋种所需的数量，以便将来进行良种调剂。打场后，村选种委员会将选出的良种（种子三斤、标本三十棵）连同村选种登记表，送给县选种委员会，参加县的良种比赛。县选种委员会选出县选良种，由县府收换，交给农场及各村留种地（留种地数目应足够全村换种之用）繁殖，以备明年村内推广。其他村选良种，则由村选种委员会发动群众就地互换，以备今秋播种之用。此外，推广良种的工作，也须通过村、县评选并尽量征求群众意见。凡经检定认可的优良品种，应由种子公司或农场加成收换，以供繁殖推广之用。
    山东省人民政府并已指派省府实业厅厅长艾楚南等十二人，组成山东省良种普及委员会，着手进行良种普及工作。该委员会并计划今年将收购小麦推广种一千一百万斤，以供各地推广。全省各专署、县、区、村的选种委员会也已经纷纷成立，即将在麦收前发动群众开展小麦选种运动。山东省人民政府实业厅已于日前派出农业技术人员九十三人，分赴徐州、泰安、邹县、文登、历城等地区，协助各该地区进行选种工作。
    【杭州讯】浙江省人民政府实业厅，于十日发出“关于发动小麦选种运动的具体布置办法”，决定本年先就杭州、杭县、临安、嘉兴、金华、兰溪、绍兴、宁波、温州、松阳九县一市作重点进行。以县、市为单位负责推动，于县（市）、乡、村各级生产委员会下成立选种委员会或选种小组，以县（市）实业部门为主，吸收农场、种子管理站、农协、农业学校及其他有关农业研究教育机构与有生产经验的农民、技术干部等参加组成，加强领导，分别主持各该县（市）、乡、村级评选工作。评选方法，主要以当地群众的需要为标准，根据收获量、病虫害轻重、品种和基杆和抗湿、抗旱、抗风力的强弱来决定。经评选合格的麦种由县（市）农业部门、农场、种子站的技术干部以及当地技术能手、生产积极分子，发动群众在适当地区予以保留推广，鼓动群众互相换种，或以公粮收换，在农场、或各区乡特约农家进行繁殖。同时各专区实业部门及农场，应就附近锈病发生严重地区，作有重点的与群众共同选取抗病品种，必要时可予以收购调剂。
    【西安讯】据群众日报消息：西北军政委员会农林部泾惠农场、陕西省三原农业推广站，为了开展小麦选种工作，特于本月十八日协同泾阳县广吉区政府，展开了该区各村长、老农座谈会。经讨论决定：（一）各村以生产小组为基础，组成选种委员会，邀请选种有经验农民或农场、推广站工作人员领导群众进行选种工作，区政府负责检查。（二）各村举行动员选种大会，宣传选种方法，发动村与村、户与户选种竞赛。明年麦收前选举选种劳动模范。（三）为照顾收割时的劳力不足，应大力动员妇女群众下地选种。（四）每户至少选够明年自己全部麦田的种子。选种办法：一、种农场改良麦种的，可挑选一块生长旺盛、整齐、没有病虫害、杂草较少的麦地，单行收割、收藏。二、普通麦种可仔细挑选穗大杆壮、颗粒饱满、没有病虫害的，单行脱粒、收藏。
