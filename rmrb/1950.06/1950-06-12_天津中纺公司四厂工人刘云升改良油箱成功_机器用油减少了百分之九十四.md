Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th. Liu Yunsheng, a technical worker at the Tianjin Zhongfang Company No. 4 Factory, successfully improved the cutter oil tank of the steel wire machine, reducing the machine's oil consumption by ninety-four percent and solving the long-standing problem of oil leakage.

　　Oil leakage from cutter oil tanks is a common problem in many textile factories across various regions. In the past, the factory's oil tanks required refueling twice a day, with an average monthly oil consumption of over one hundred pounds per hundred steel wire machines. Last year, after Liu Yunsheng's initial improvements, the monthly oil consumption per hundred steel wire machines was reduced from one hundred and twenty pounds to fifty pounds. In January of this year, he further identified the cause of oil leakage. After repeated research and experimentation with fellow steel wire maintenance workers at the No. 4 Factory, he finally found a way to prevent oil leakage. Now, the frequency of refueling the oil tanks has been reduced to once every month or so, and the monthly oil consumption per hundred machines has been reduced to seven pounds, completely eliminating the phenomenon of oil leakage.

　　Liu Yunsheng has now been promoted to steel wire specialist technician at the company, and the new method will be widely promoted in various factories. According to calculations, if all factories make improvements, more than 11,700 catties of corn flour can be saved daily.

    机器用油减少了百分之九十四
    【新华社天津九日电】天津中纺公司第四厂技术工人刘云升改良钢丝机斩刀油箱成功，使机器用油减少了百分之九十四，并解决了从来没有解决的漏油问题。
    斩刀油箱的漏油，是各地很多纺织厂中存在的困难问题。过去该厂油箱要每天加油两次，每百台钢丝机每月平均用油都在一百磅以上。去年，经过刘云升初步改进，每百台钢丝机每月的用油量，便由一百二十磅，减少到五十磅。今年一月份，他更进一步找出漏油原因，经过他同四厂钢丝保全工友反复研究试验，终于找到了防止漏油的办法。现油箱的加油次数，减到一个多月一次，每百台每月用油量减少到了七磅，漏油的现象根本没有了。
    现刘云升已被提升为该公司钢丝专门技师，新的办法亦将在各厂普遍推行。根据计算，如各厂全部改进后，每日可节省玉米面一万一千七百多斤。
