　　"Man Can Conquer Nature"
    ——A Record of Wuxiang Second District's Victory Over Hail Disaster
    Li Pengfei, Ji Xijian, Li Chunren
    I. The Hailstorm's Attack
    On the afternoon of May 25th, starting from 1:00 PM and lasting until dinner time, all thirty-three administrative villages and one hundred and eighty-two natural villages in Wuxiang Second District were simultaneously attacked by a hailstorm. Yaoshangou and the other four administrative villages were hit by hail as many as six times.

    II. The Anti-Hail Struggle
    When heavy, dense hail clouds pressed upon the head of the Second District, the prepared masses of the Second District began to fight the hail clouds. The first to fire cannons was Shangbeizhang Village. After Dou Zengrong, an old man from the "Weather Observation Team," reported his observations and stated that the cloud formation was unusual, Guo Buxiang, the organization member of the CCP District Committee stationed in the village, immediately led the militia to open fire. Immediately afterwards, the cannons of Yaoshangou, Xibao, Hanbi, Zhuanbi and other villages also sounded. In an instant, all nine hundred and thirty-one iron cannons, earthen cannons, and elm cannons in the district were fired at the hail clouds.

    As soon as the hail began to appear, it was immediately met with a rumble of cannon fire, and the attacking hailstones were beaten into rain. In Shangbeizhang, under the personal leadership of Guo Buxiang of the CCP District Committee, more than fifty militiamen were distributed across six hail defense platforms, and fifty iron cannons fired four times into the air. Li Shude, a Party member from Yaoshangou, and Gong Sanhai, director of the Military Affairs Committee, led eighty militiamen in a battle against the hailstorm, firing a total of six times. During the "May 25th" anti-hail struggle, the entire district used a total of ninety-nine and a half catties of gunpowder; villages with less gunpowder fired six hundred and fifty-eight bullets and one hundred and forty-seven hand-thrown grenades. After seven hours, the villages, through five or six intense battles, finally defeated the hailstorm, protecting the safety of more than sixty thousand mu of wheat and seedlings from major damage.

    After the victory of the anti-hail struggle, old man Chai Qinghai of Shangbeizhang Village clapped his hands happily and said, "It really works, it really works!" He then gave a years-old iron cannon he had stored to the militia. Li Laiyin, Li Wuqi, and four others from Baijiazhuang voluntarily donated six dou of rice, requesting more gunpowder and iron cannons. The masses of Zhuanbi, on the second day after the anti-hail victory, requested that the cadres add twenty-two more iron cannons.

    III. Experiences from the Anti-Hail Struggle
    After the victory of the anti-hail struggle, the district government convened a meeting of village chiefs from the entire district on the 27th to summarize the experiences of this struggle:

    First, the preparations were relatively good. In the past month, under the repeated emphasis by the CCP County Committee on preventing hail, protecting wheat, and protecting seedlings, the District Committee also emphasized the leadership of anti-hail preparation work, enabling the villages to make appropriate preparations before the hail disaster, which was the basic reason for this victory over the hail disaster. Since the deployment of anti-hail work at the village cadre meeting on May 3rd, the entire district has built two hundred new iron cannons, purchased three hundred and fifty-six catties and ten taels of new gunpowder, and repaired and newly built one hundred and seventy-five hail defense platforms. In particular, Yaoshangou, Shangbeizhang, Hanbi and other villages have repaired their hail defense platforms very well.

    Second, the organizational leadership of anti-hail work was strengthened. All villages in the district have reorganized the organization of the anti-hail headquarters: a headquarters is set up in the village, and a group is set up in the natural village. Among the thirty-three administrative villages, a total of five hundred and thirty-five anti-hail committee members, group leaders, etc. were selected; the militiamen of each village were uniformly under the direct leadership of the anti-hail headquarters. Such organized and led actions guaranteed the victory of this struggle.

    Third, all villages have "Weather Observation Teams" to identify cloud formations and strive for timely cannon fire. In this struggle, the weather observation teams that played the greatest role were Dou Zengrong of Shangbeizhang, Hu Yongsheng of Hanbi, and Li Yueyun of Xibao. As soon as they saw that the sky was not right, they immediately beat gongs, rang bells, and blew horns to gather the militia for defense, thus achieving timely cannon fire.

    Fourth, the sub-districts were organized into hail defense networks, with district cadres responsible for observing the sky. If the cloud formations were unusual, they used cannon fire and horn signals to contact neighboring villages.

    Fifth, Party members and cadres took the lead and played an exemplary role. For example, Li Bing, a Party member from Hanbi Village, seeing that the gunpowder on the hail defense platform had run out, braved the hail and rain to return to the village to get gunpowder. Li Haiwang, a Party member from Zhuanbi Village, after the matches on the hail defense platform were used up, braved the wind, rain, and hail to return to the village to get matches.

    IV. Losses, Lessons, and Problems
    In this hailstorm, twenty-six natural villages in six administrative villages suffered greater losses. It is estimated that 2,856 mu of wheat fields will suffer a 26% reduction in yield; 2,348 mu of autumn seedlings need to be replanted. The most severely affected were Zhujiashan, Nanshan, and Xiabeizhang villages. Zhujiashan had almost prepared its cannons and gunpowder, but the reason was that it fired too late. The hail came down while they were in a meeting, so they suffered losses. Xiabeizhang suffered because the preparation work was not done well; the entire village only had one hail defense platform.

    In this anti-hail struggle, it was discovered that some problems still need to be resolved in administrative villages with dispersed natural villages. Shangbeizhang Village is a main village, and the cannons and gunpowder are concentrated here. As a result, Shangbeizhang's gunpowder was not used up, while the subordinate natural village of Yangtaowan suffered a disaster. This problem must be solved by increasing gunpowder and cannons.

    V. Continue to Prepare, Don't Let Hail Become a Disaster
    After the village cadre meeting summarized the experiences and lessons of this struggle, it immediately made arrangements to continue strengthening anti-hail preparation work. Dongbao and sixteen other villages have established plans to increase iron cannons by two hundred and ninety-three. All thirty-three villages in the district have established plans to increase gunpowder by seven hundred and twenty-seven catties to continue preventing hail. The slogan of everyone is: "Don't let hail become a disaster."

    After defeating the hailstorm, the county leadership considered it an unprecedented glorious achievement. The CCP County Committee, the County People's Government, and the County People's Armed Forces Department specially issued a circular to commend them.

　　“人定胜天”
    ——记武乡二区战胜雹灾
    李鹏飞　籍希俭　李纯仁
    一、雹灾的袭击
    五月二十五日下午，从一点钟开始，一直到吃晚饭的时候，武乡二区三十三个行政村、一百八十二个自然村同时遭到雹灾的袭击。窑上沟等四个行政村，落雹达六次之多。
    二、防雹斗争
    当沉重浓密的雹云压在二区头顶上的时候，有准备的二区群众便开始向雹云战斗了。第一个打炮的是上北漳村，在“观天组”窦增荣老汉报告观察结果、说明云头不对之后，驻在该村的中共区分委组织委员郭步祥，立即领导民兵开炮射击。紧接着窑上沟、西堡、韩壁、砖壁等村的炮，也都打响了。一霎时全区九百三十一门铁炮、土炮、榆木炮，都朝着雹云轰打起来。
    雹子刚一露头，立即就是一阵隆隆的炮声，袭来的冰雹，就被打得变成了雨水。上北漳在中共区分委郭步祥亲自领导下，五十多个民兵分布在六个防雹台上，五十门铁炮，对空进行了四次射击。窑上沟党员李树德、武委会主任弓三孩，领导八十个民兵，与冰雹展开战斗，共放炮六次。全区在“五、二五”防雹斗争中，共用了火药九十九斤半；火药少的村庄，打子弹六百五十八发，手溜弹一百四十七颗。前后七小时，各村经过五、六次的紧张战斗，终于战胜了雹灾，保护了六万余亩麦子和小苗的安全，没有遭受大的损失。
    防雹斗争胜利结束后，上北漳村柴清海老汉，高兴地拍着手说：“就是顶事，就是顶事！”随即把他存放多年的一门铁炮给了民兵。白家庄李来银、李五七等六人，自动献出六斗米，要求增加火药和铁炮。砖壁群众，在防雹胜利的第二天，要求干部再增加二十二门铁炮。
    三、防雹斗争的经验
    防雹斗争胜利后，区政府于二十七日召开了全区的村长会议，总结了这次斗争的经验：
    第一，准备工作比较好。近一月来，在中共县委再三强调防雹、保麦、护苗的号召下，区委也重视了防雹准备工作的领导，使各村在雹灾未来前有了适当的准备，这是此次战胜雹灾的基本原因。五月三日村干会上布置了防雹工作以来，全区共新打铁炮二百门，新买火药三百五十六斤十两，修理与新筑防雹台一百七十五个，特别是窑上沟、上北漳、韩壁等村，防雹台修理得很好。
    第二，加强了防雹工作的组织领导。全区各村都整顿了防雹指挥部的组织：村设指挥部，自然村设小组。三十三个行政村中，共选出防雹委员、小组长等五百三十五人；各村民兵，统一受防雹指挥部的直接领导。这样有组织有领导的行动起来，保证了这次斗争的胜利。
    第三，各村普遍设有“观天组”，识别云头，争取打炮及时。在这次斗争中，观天组起作用最大的是上北漳窦增荣、韩壁胡永胜、西堡李月云等。他们一看到天色不对，就立即打锣、敲钟、吹号，集中民兵准备防御，因而作到了及时打炮。
    第四，以小区组织成防雹网，由区干部负责观察天色，云头不对，即用打炮、吹号等记号联络邻村。
    第五，党员干部带头，起模范作用。如：韩壁村党员李炳，看到防雹台火药已经打完，不避雹雨淋打，跑回村去取火药。砖壁村党员李海旺，于防雹台上火柴用完后，不畏风雨雹子，回村拿火。
    四、损失、教训和问题
    这次雹灾有六个行政村的二十六个自然村遭受损失较大。计有麦田二千八百五十六亩减收百分之二十六；秋苗须补种者二千三百四十八亩。其中最重者为朱家山、南山、下北漳三村。朱家山的炮和药都准备得差不多，原因是打得迟了。雹子下来时，正值开会，因此遭受了损失。下北漳是因为准备工作作得不好，全村只有一个防雹台。
    在这次防雹斗争中，发现自然村分散的行政村有些问题还需要加以解决。上北漳村是个主村，把炮和药都集中在这里，结果上北漳的药没打完，而所属自然村杨桃湾却受了灾害。这一问题必须用增加火药和炮来解决。
    五、继续准备，不让下雹成灾
    村干会议总结了这次斗争的经验教训后，随即进行了继续加强防雹准备工作的布置。东堡等十六村，订立了增加铁炮二百九十三门的计划。全区三十三个村，订了增加火药七百二十七斤的计划，以继续防雹。大家的口号是：“不让下雹成灾”。
    战胜雹灾后，县领导机关认为是空前的辉煌成绩。中共县委和县人民政府、县人民武装部等，特通报予以表扬。
