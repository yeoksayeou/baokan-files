Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th—Following the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands, troops of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, from late May to early June, successively occupied Tanhushan Island and Yupanshan Island east of Zhapu Town at the mouth of Hangzhou Bay, and Banji Mountain Island, Baisha Island, Shepan Mountain Island, Chuan’ao Island, Langji Mountain Island, and Gotou Mountain Island along the Zhejiang coast, all of which were entrenched by scattered remnants of the Kuomintang bandits. In occupying Tanhushan Island and Banji Mountain Island, the People's Liberation Army killed more than 20 enemy soldiers and captured more than 120 bandits, including Hu Zhenhua, the captain of the mobile detachment of the First Column of Coastal Bandits. They seized seven light and heavy machine guns, 137 various guns, and a portion of other military supplies. The remnant bandits who fled to the small coastal islands had nowhere to hide under the military suppression of the People's Liberation Army. They attempted to sneak into the mainland, but under the close guard of our coastal defense forces in various places and the close cooperation of the broad masses of peasant self-defense armed forces, all those who dared to land were completely annihilated. A number of remnant bandits attempting to land stealthily were successively annihilated near Laoshan south of Qingdao, near Miaogang in Nanhui County, Jiangsu, and near Zaoshan in Zhangpu County, Fujian. More than 30 bandits were killed, and Guo Limao, the commander of the Second Column of the "Shandong Area People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," Jiang Zhenyu, the deputy commander, and Li Wenlian, the independent second detachment leader of the Bandit National Defense Department's 3861 Unit, and 210 other bandits were captured. Seven light and heavy machine guns, 94 various guns, more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition, and two radio stations were seized. Currently, the military regions of various provinces in East China have issued circulars to the coastal defense forces to continue strict precautions and to closely cooperate with the anti-bandit public security forces, striving to thoroughly eliminate banditry as soon as possible and further stabilize social order.
