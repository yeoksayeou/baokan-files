　　Introduction to Yu Zhanshan's Slide Rule Algorithm (II)
    If you want to divide a strip of wood into five equal segments, simply place the strip of wood diagonally on a wooden board with equally spaced parallel lines. Align one end of the wood strip with the 0 line on the board, and the other end diagonally with the 5 line. Mark a point on the wood strip at the 1, 2, 3, and 4 lines. This will divide the wood strip into five equal segments. Using the same method, the wood strip can be divided into any number of equal segments. This method is called the "planar oblique division method."
    From the above two methods, it can be seen that when a ruler placed obliquely on a plane can divide the plane into equal parts obliquely, the plane can also divide a strip of wood placed obliquely on the plane into equal parts. Therefore, considering these two actions together, they essentially play a role of "mutual bisection." This is called "mutual bisection."
    Through further research and experimentation, he finally succeeded in developing a method for calculating multiplication and division using a ruler.
    Method for Calculating Multiplication and Division Using a Ruler Successfully Developed
    Yu Zhanshan placed a one-foot-long ruler diagonally on a one-foot-wide wooden board marked with equal divisions (as shown in Figure 4). He aligned the 10-inch mark on the ruler with the 8-inch line on the wooden board, and the lower end of the ruler (the 0 point) with the 0-point line on the wooden board. He then observed that the 1-inch mark on the ruler was directly above the 8-fen mark on the board, the 2-inch mark above the 1-cun 6-fen mark, the 3-inch mark above the 2-cun 4-fen mark, ... and the 9-inch mark above the 7-cun 2-fen mark. This perfectly corresponded to the multiplication table: "One eight is eight, two eights are sixteen, three eights are twenty-four, ... eight nines are seventy-two." From this, he discovered a method for calculating multiplication using a ruler. However, the number of digits in the result had to be determined using another method.
    At the same time, he observed that the 1-inch mark on the wooden board was directly above the 1.25-inch mark on the ruler. He realized that dividing one foot into eight equal parts would result in each part being 1.25 inches, i.e., 1 cun 2 fen 5 li. Its mathematical meaning is 10 ÷ 8 = 1.25. From this, he also derived a method for performing division using a ruler. However, the number of digits in the result also needed to be determined using another method.
    He named this calculating tool, consisting of a ruler and a wooden board, the "square ruler calculator." The ruler was called the "heavenly ruler," and the wooden board was called the "earthly ruler."
    Creation of the "Circular Ruler Calculator" and the "Rectangular Ruler Calculator"
    After Yu Zhanshan discovered the method for performing multiplication and division using the "square ruler calculator," he continued his research and subsequently invented methods for using the "square ruler calculator" to solve problems involving exponentiation, square root extraction, cube root extraction, jin/liang calculations, conversions, ratios, and proportions. He felt that although using such a ruler and a wooden board to calculate was simple, it was bulky and inconvenient to carry. Therefore, he continued his research and experimentation. He realized that when using the "square ruler calculator" to calculate various problems, the ruler rotated on the wooden board, forming exactly a quarter of a circle (requiring the 0 point of the heavenly ruler to be aligned with the 0 line of the earthly ruler and kept stationary). This inspired him to utilize the "circle." At the same time, he realized through repeated experiments that the scale on the ruler for calculating multiplication and division could not be equally spaced but should be a gradually decreasing, unequal scale. After repeated research and experimentation, he found a new scaling method. Based on the principle of the "square ruler calculator," he combined the functions of the two rulers into one ruler. Because the heavenly ruler is placed obliquely on the earthly ruler, each horizontal line on the earthly ruler can cause a change in the obliquity of the heavenly ruler. Therefore, dividing one by any number can yield its oblique division distance. Yu Zhanshan called this oblique division distance the "oblique division standard." He calculated this "oblique division standard," formed by the different obliquities of the heavenly ruler and the earthly ruler, using the following method.
    As shown in Figure 6, fix the 0 point of the heavenly ruler on the 0 point of the earthly ruler. Place one foot and one fen (i.e., 1.01 cun) of the heavenly ruler obliquely on one foot (i.e., 1.00 foot) of the earthly ruler. The one-foot mark on the heavenly ruler will be directly above the 0.99-foot mark on the earthly ruler, representing 1 ÷ 1.01 = 0.99. This 0.99 is the oblique division standard for one foot and one fen (1.01). Place one foot and two fen (i.e., 1.02) of the heavenly ruler obliquely on one foot of the earthly ruler. The one-foot mark on the heavenly ruler will be directly above the 0.98-foot mark on the earthly ruler. This 0.98 is the oblique division standard for 1.02. Place one foot and three fen (i.e., 1.03) of the heavenly ruler obliquely on one foot of the earthly ruler. The one-foot mark on the heavenly ruler will be directly above the 0.97-foot mark on the earthly ruler. This 0.97 is the oblique division standard for 1.03.

　　于振善尺算法介绍（二）
    如果想把一根木条分成五个相等的段，只要把这根木条斜在一块画有等分平行线的木板上，木条的一端对在木板的０线上，另一端斜在５线上，在木条对着的１．２．３．４．线上各记上一个点。这样即可把这木条分成五段。用同样的方法，可以把木条分成任何相等的段。这种方法就叫作“平面分斜法”。
    由以上的两种方法看来，当斜在平面上的尺子可以把平面斜分成等份的时候，同时平面亦可将斜在平面上的木条分成等份。所以将这两种作用连系来看，实在是起着一种“互相平分”的作用。这就叫作“互相平分”。
    由此又经过多次的研究试验，他终于研究成功了用尺子算乘除的方法。
    用尺子算乘除的方法研究成功了
    于振善把一个一尺长的尺子斜放在一个一尺宽，且画有相等分寸的木板上（如第四图所示），将尺子的１０寸对准木板上的８寸的线上，尺子的下端（即０点）对准木板上０点的线上，再看木尺上的１寸正对着木板上的８分，２寸对着木板上的１寸６分，３寸对着２寸４分，……９寸对着７寸２分和普通乘法的口诀“一八得八，二八一十六，三八二十四，……八九七十二”完全符合。由这里他找到了用尺子算乘法的方法。不过得数的位数得用另外的方法来求。
    同时，他看到木板上的１寸正对着尺子上的１．２５寸。他想到把一尺分成八份，每份应当是１．２５寸，即１寸２分５厘。它的数学意义，就是１０÷８＝１．２５。由这里他又得了用尺子作除法的方法。不过得数的位数也需要用另外的方法来求。
    他把这由一根尺子、一块木板所组成的计算工具，叫作“方形尺算器”。尺子叫作“天尺”，木板叫作“地尺”。
    “圆形尺算器”和“长形尺算器”的创造
    于振善发现了用“方形尺算器”作乘除的方法以后，又继续研究，相继发明了用“方形尺算器”来解决乘方、开平立方、斤两算法、折合、比例等问题。他感到用这样一根尺子和一块木板来算账虽然简捷，可是很笨重，不便于携带，于是又继续研究试验。他体会到在用“方形尺算器”计算各种算题时，尺子在木板上转动，恰好是四分之一个圆周（需要把天尺的０点和地尺的０线对准不动）。这又启发了他对于“圆”的利用的动机。同时，他由屡次的试验中体会到算乘除法的尺子的刻度，不能是等分的，而应当是一种由大而小的不等长的刻度。经过反复研究与试验，他找到了一种新的刻度方法。他根据“方形尺算器”的道理，把两个尺的作用全归到一个尺子上。因天尺是斜在地尺上的，地尺上的每一条横线都能使天尺的斜度起一次变化。所以如用任何数去除一，便可以得出它的斜分距离。于振善把这个斜分距离叫作“斜分标准”。他就把这种天尺和地尺，由于斜度不同而成的错落的“斜分标准”依下法求出。
    如第六图所示，把天尺的０固定在地尺的０点上，把天尺的一尺一分（即１．０１寸）斜在地尺的一尺（即１．００尺）上，天尺的１尺正对着地尺上的０．９９尺，就是代表１÷１．０１＝０．９９。这０．９９即是一尺一分（１．０１）的斜分标准。把天尺的一尺二分（即１，０２）斜在地尺的一尺上，天尺上的一尺正对着地尺上的０．９８尺。这０．９８即是１．０２的斜分标准。把天尺的一尺三分（即１．０３）斜在地尺上的一尺上，天尺上的一尺正对着地尺上的０．９７尺。这０．９７即是１．０３的斜分标准。
