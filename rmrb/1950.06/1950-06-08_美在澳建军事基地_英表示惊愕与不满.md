TASS, Prague, June 6th: Reuter's London correspondent reports: The British Foreign Office has confidentially asked the Australian government for an "explanation" regarding the actions taken by the Australian government in permitting the United States the right to construct air and naval bases on Australian territory.

During secret negotiations in Canberra between the Australian government and representatives of the US State Department, an agreement was reached to hand over Manus Island in the Bismarck Archipelago, including New Britain, New Ireland, and northeastern New Guinea, to the United States for "protection." The Americans are preparing to build large bases there for the US Pacific Fleet and Air Force.

However, the Australian government did not deem it necessary to notify the British government of the course or results of the negotiations. The British Foreign Office expressed surprise at this matter in a confidential note.

According to sources close to the British Foreign Office: the construction of US military bases on these Australian islands should be regarded as a new attempt by the United States to expand its bases in the Pacific at the expense of British interests.

　　美在澳建军事基地  英表示惊愕与不满
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社布拉格六日讯：电通社伦敦记者报道：英国外交部已机密地请澳大利亚政府“解释”澳政府在准许美国有权在澳大利亚领土上构筑空军和海军基地这件事情上所采取的行动。
    澳政府和美国国务院代表在堪培拉举行秘密谈判期间已取得协议，将新不列颠岛、新爱尔兰岛和新几内亚东北的俾斯麦群岛中的曼纽斯岛，移交美国“保护”。美国人正准备在那些地方为美国太平洋舰队和空军建立大基地。
    但是，澳大利亚政府并不认为有将谈判经过或其结果通知英政府的必要。英国外交部机密照会中对于此事表示惊愕。
    据接近英国外交部的人士称：在澳大利亚的这些岛屿上构筑美军基地一事，应视为美国的新企图，要牺牲英国的利益而扩张美国在太平洋中的基地。
