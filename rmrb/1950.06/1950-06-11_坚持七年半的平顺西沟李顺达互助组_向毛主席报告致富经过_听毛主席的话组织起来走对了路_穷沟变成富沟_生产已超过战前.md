[This news report] The People’s Daily reported that when spring plowing and planting ended, the Ping Shun Xigou Village Communist Party branch led Party members and non-Party members in summarizing and evaluating their work, and held a symposium on summarizing the experiences of the mutual aid teams. Through summarizing, everyone unanimously recognized that organizing to improve technology is a new road to increasing production and becoming rich. Thinking about the past and comparing it with the present, life is becoming more and more prosperous, and the poor valley has become a rich one. Everyone says that this is because they listened to Chairman Mao's words and took the right path. They unanimously proposed to write a letter to Chairman Mao to report the results of organizing to increase production and become rich. The original letter is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

Our village is a small mountain valley in Ping Shun, remote with high mountains and thick rocks. In the old society, feudal landlords exploited and oppressed us. Six of the 20 households in the village were long-term laborers, seven households rented land, and the rest could not make enough to eat for half the year. Only two households had enough to eat. We were often hungry and ate bran and wild herbs. Since the Communist Party came, leading us, we have slowly turned ourselves around. I remember that in 1942, we suffered a great famine. In 1943, in order to survive the famine, you called on us to organize. Listening to your words, we organized a mutual aid team. At first, there were only six households. The original plan was to cultivate 30 mu, but everyone worked hard and cultivated more than 120 mu, all planted with potatoes. This was a turning point. Li Shunda's family alone dug up more than 90 sacks (one sack weighs more than 100 jin), and the whole valley dug up more than 100,000 jin. We safely survived the famine, and we still haven't finished eating the dried potato slices from that year. The next year, the grain harvest was more than 120 shi. This laid a solid foundation. That year, we bought more than 40 shi of rice paddy land, five livestock, and other farm tools. Everyone saw that organizing had great benefits, and more and more people participated, forming a total of five teams. At that time, there were many war support tasks. In the year of Changzhi's liberation, only one person was left in each team. We mobilized women and children to participate in the autumn harvest, overcoming the difficulties of manpower and animal power. After the land reform, the land returned to our homes. In the past, we worked on other people's land, but now we work on our own land, so everyone's enthusiasm for production is even greater. In recent years, war support tasks have decreased, so we have been working diligently on our own land under the leadership of the government, processing and adding fertilizer. Everyone bought two-legged seeders, experimented with planting high-quality varieties such as Golden Queen, and learned techniques such as warm water seed soaking and seed dressing with pesticides. We realized that the saying "farming requires no skill, just hard work" was wrong, and we changed the bad habit of not plowing in the spring. Now we feel that listening to the government is never wrong, and only improving technology will increase grain production. Now, 19 out of the 20 households in our village have joined the mutual aid teams, implementing the principle of voluntary, equivalent exchange, and mutual benefit, and have been consolidated to this day. Because we have been working together for eight years, everyone is used to it, just like a family. Now our lives are better than before, and production has exceeded pre-war levels. The most, such as Li Shunda and five other households, have exceeded it by more than double, and the others by more than half. There were originally 18 livestock, now there are 39, exceeding the pre-war level by 21. There were originally 50 sheep, now there are 120 sheep. Every household has surplus grain, with four households having more than 10 to 15 shi, and the rest having less than 10 shi. The whole valley has a total of 130 shi of surplus grain, and only two households do not have enough labor, but it is still enough to eat. This year, when we summarized the experience of mutual aid, everyone was very happy to summarize it here. Wang Size said: In the past, we ate bran and vegetables, wore torn clothes, and the whole family shared a quilt, using corn stalks to build a house. But now we can wear whole clothes, one person has a quilt, we can spread a felt mat, and we have a cotton robe in winter. This year, we built three new houses, and it doesn't feel very difficult. We really can't forget Chairman Mao. Everyone says that this is because we listened to your words and unanimously thanked you for pointing out the correct direction.

After several years of mutual aid, we have found that organizing and improving technology is a good way to get rich. Fourteen of us have formulated a five-year plan for prosperity and construction, to use our current grain reserves well in reproduction and develop forestry and animal husbandry. When new farm tools arrive, we must buy them to make everyone's life more prosperous. Ma Haixing said: I will never forget the benefits of mutual aid. Listening to Chairman Mao's words, life will get better and better, turning a poor valley into a rich one.

Last autumn, our village labor hero Li Shunda visited Beijing and told us that he saw you and shook hands with you. He also told us that you asked about everyone and wanted us to produce well. Everyone was very happy to hear this and said: You are truly our good leader, and we will never forget you.

Wishing you good health forever!

　　坚持七年半的平顺西沟李顺达互助组
    向毛主席报告致富经过
    听毛主席的话组织起来走对了路
    穷沟变成富沟·生产已超过战前
    【本报讯】山西平顺西沟村中共党支部在春耕下种结束时，领导党内外进行总结评选，并召开了互助组总结经验座谈会。经过总结，大家一致认识了组织起来提高技术，是增产致富的新道路。想了想过去，比了比现在，时光一天比一天富裕起来了，穷沟已经变成了富沟。都说这是听上了毛主席的话，走对了路。一致提出要写信报告毛主席组织起来增产致富的成果。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    俺村是平顺最偏僻的一个小山沟，山高石厚。在旧社会里封建地主压榨剥削我们，全村二十户有六户住长工，有七户租种地，其余的也是一年闹下不够半年吃，只有两户够吃。我们经常是受饥挨饿，吃糠咽菜。自从共产党来了，领导俺们慢慢地才算翻了身。记的在一九四二年遭了大灾荒，一九四三年为了度荒，你号召我们组织起来。听上了你的话，我们组织了互助组。开始只有六户。原计划开三十亩，大家一股劲开了一百二十多亩，全部种成山药蛋。这一下可就抓住了。单李顺达一家就刨了九十多布袋（一布袋有一百多斤），全沟共刨十万多斤。平安度过了灾荒，那年的干山药片现在还没吃完。第二年种的谷打了一百二十多石。这就扎住了根。当年就买了四十多石米的地，五个牲口，及其他农具等。大家看见组织起来好处大，参加的人越来越多，共组织了五个组。那时战勤任务很多，长治解放的那年，一组只留下一个人。我们发动了妇女儿童参加收秋，战胜了人畜力的困难。经过土地改革，土地回了家。过去我们是在别人土地上出力，现在是在自己土地上劳动，这样大家的生产劲头就更大了。这几年战勤减少了，我们就在政府领导下在自己的土地上精耕细作，加工加肥。大家伙买了两条腿耧，试验种金皇后等优良品种，学会了温汤浸种，药剂拌种等技术，知道了过去人们常说的“种地没巧，出力就好”是不对的，改变了过去春不犁地的坏习惯。现在我们感到听上政府的话永没错，只有提高技术才会多打粮食。现在我们全庄二十户就有十九家参加了互助组，执行了自愿等价两利原则，一直巩固到现在。由于八年来在一块劳动，大家已习惯了，就好像一家人一样。现在我们的时光都比以前过好了，产量都超过了战前。最多的李顺达等五户就超过了一倍，其他的超过了半倍以上。牲口原有十八个，现在有三十九个，超过战前二十一个。原有五十只羊，现有一百二十只羊。家家都有余粮，最多的十石以上到十五石的有四家，其余都是十石以下的。全沟共有一百三十石余粮，只有两家因为没劳力，但也够吃了。今年俺们总结互助经验时，总结到这里大家都很高兴。王四则说：过去吃的是糠菜，穿的是挽圪塔衣裳，全家人伙盖一条被子，用玉茭秆围起来就顶房子住；可是现在能穿个囫囵衣裳，一个人盖一条被子，能铺块毡子，冬天还有个棉袍子。今年新盖了三间房，也觉着不很困难，实在不能忘了毛主席。都说这是听上了你的话，一致感谢你指示的方向正确。
    经过几年的互助，我们找到了组织起来，提高技术，这是发家致富的好道路。我们有十四家订出了五年发家建设计划，要把现在的这些存粮，好好的用在再生产上，发展林牧业；新式农具来了，我们一定要买，使大家的生活更富裕起来。马海兴说：我永远忘不了互助的好处，听上毛主席的话一天会比一天好起来，把穷沟变成富沟。
    去年秋后，俺村劳动英雄李顺达在北京参观回来，他告诉俺们说见到了你，还与你握过手。并告说你问讯我们大家啦，要我们好好生产，大家听了都很高兴，都说：你真正是我们大家的好领袖，俺们永远忘不了你。
    祝你身体永远健康！
                        平顺县二区西沟村互助组全体
                                                五月十五日
