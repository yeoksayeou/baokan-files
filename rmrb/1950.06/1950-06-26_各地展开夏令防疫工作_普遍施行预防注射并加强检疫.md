Across the country, various local People's Governments, following the instructions of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Military Health of the Central People's Government to strengthen summer disease prevention work, and based on the general principle of "prevention first, medical treatment as a supplement" for health work, have widely launched various disease prevention measures.

East China

Cities in the East China region, such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Fuzhou, and Xiamen, have universally carried out vaccinations against summer infectious diseases and launched sanitation campaigns. Shanghai plans to vaccinate three million people, and by early June, more than 88% of this goal had been achieved. Hangzhou has vaccinated over 100,000 people. Nanjing has vaccinated 250,000 people. The Anhui North Administrative Office has purchased a combined typhoid and cholera vaccine for 1.75 million people, which has been distributed to various regions for vaccination. Anhui South has also prepared 150,000 cc of cholera and typhoid vaccines.

Central and South China

Cities in the Central and South China region, such as Wuhan and Kaifeng, and provinces such as Hunan and Hubei, have all widely launched summer disease prevention work. From May 22nd to 31st, Wuhan vaccinated over 243,000 people against summer infectious diseases and organized three propaganda teams to carry out disease prevention education along the Yangtze River, the Han River, and the railway lines. Kaifeng has established a disease prevention committee and sub-committees in each district, as well as 25 disease prevention stations and health inspection teams in each district, universally carrying out vaccinations and cleaning up garbage, and repairing streets. The People's Liberation Army stationed in the city actively participated in this work. Hunan Province has determined a disease prevention work policy for this year that focuses on the prevention and control of cholera while also preventing typhoid and dysentery. Disease prevention committees have been established in all counties and cities to carry out disease prevention propaganda and education work. It is planned to add 680 isolation and treatment beds in seven major cities such as Changsha and Changde, and establish a provincial disease prevention team (divided into four squadrons). At the same time, more than 1.8 million cc of cholera and combined cholera-typhoid vaccines have been distributed, with plans to vaccinate 1.7 million people. Quarantine stations will also be established in 15 locations including Changsha, Hengyang, Yizhang, and Yueyang. Anhua County in the province has recently discovered smallpox, which has already caused more than 200 deaths. The local special commissioner's office and county government are vigorously organizing prevention and treatment. Since the beginning of summer, seven districts in Luotian County, Hubei Province, have discovered epidemics such as smallpox, measles, and typhoid. The county and district people's governments have organized public and private medical personnel to carry out emergency treatment, and have trained more than 100 primary and secondary school teachers to assist in vaccinations. Xishui County in the province has formed a medical prevention team to universally carry out disease prevention vaccinations for more than 8,000 dike-repairing workers.

Southwest China

In order to strengthen summer disease prevention, the Health Department of the Southwest China Military and Political Committee has instructed the establishment of quarantine stations in more than 20 key transportation hubs by land and water in Chongqing, eastern Sichuan, northern Sichuan, western Sichuan, southern Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Xikang provinces. Chongqing began preventive vaccinations on May 26th. The Municipal Health Bureau organized 1,068 public and private medical personnel into 268 teams to carry out vaccinations.

North China

In the North China region, Beijing has dredged the Three Seas, which had accumulated silt and water, and cleaned up the ditches. All cities and provinces have vigorously launched summer disease prevention work in urban and rural areas. For example, the Anyang Special District of Pingyuan Province organized doctors and trained teachers to engage in vaccinations. According to statistics from six counties including Tangyin, more than 294,400 people have been vaccinated. Zhang Xiutun in Zhaoyang County, Hebei, and Dong and Xilangziqiao in Hengshui County have recently discovered dry cholera, and Jincheng County has discovered smallpox. The local governments have organized emergency treatment and prevented the spread of the epidemics. Tong County, Zhuo County, and Anci County in the province have begun cholera and typhoid preventive vaccinations, and have carried out work such as cleaning toilets, catching flies, cleaning up ditches, and managing the food industry in cities and towns.
