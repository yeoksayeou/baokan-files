    The Story of a Pencil
    Yu Zhen
    (Comic Strip) (I)
    (I) The superiors gave each comrade a pencil. Jia Guanglin received the pencil and treated it like a treasure, even holding it in his hand while sleeping, and hurriedly putting it in his pocket when he woke up. The comrades were very curious. One day, the comrades asked him, "Why do you love this pencil so much?" Jia Guanglin said, "Don't underestimate this pencil; it can help us learn. The superiors are thinking of us when they call on us to study culture; if we don't cherish the pencil they give us, we'll be letting the superiors down." After a pause, he continued, "I even got into trouble because of a pencil when I was young." So the comrades all gathered around him, listening to him tell the story of a pencil.
    (II) The children of the rich sit in school, while the children of the poor have been working for the landlord since they were young. From the age of eight, I herded pigs for the landlord outside. My father and my brother also worked for the landlord. Year after year, we couldn't pay off the landlord's debts.
    (III) I remember when I was thirteen, I was herding pigs for the landlord, Xue Yongsheng. After the frost, the courtyard was full of snow. The landlord's family, old and young, had already put on their fur coats and were sitting on the heated kang, warming themselves by the fire. That day, after I finished feeding the pigs and locked them in the pen, I suddenly heard the sound of reading. I put down my broom and went to take a look.
    (IV) Around the corner was the elementary school. I quietly walked to the windowsill to listen. I saw other people's children holding pens and writing, and others holding books and reading. The more I looked, the more envious I became.

    一支铅笔的故事
    余真
    （连环画）（一）
    （一）上级发给每个同志一支铅笔。贾广林拿到铅笔，像得到宝贝似的，睡觉时还握在手里，醒来时就忙揣在兜里。同志们都很奇怪。有一天同志们就问他：“你为啥这样爱铅笔？”贾广林说：“别看这支铅笔是个小东西，它能帮助咱学习。上级号召咱学文化是为咱着想；发给咱铅笔，咱不爱护也对不起上级。”停了一会儿他又说：“我小的时候因为一支铅笔还惹了祸。”于是同志们都围着他，听他给讲一支铅笔的故事。
    （二）有钱人的子弟在学堂里坐，穷人家的孩子从小就给地主扛活。我从八岁那年起给地主在外面放猪。我爹和我哥哥也给地主扛活。扛了一年又一年，地主的债务还也还不完。
    （三）记得在我十三岁那年，正给地主薛永生放猪。过了霜降，大雪满院。地主家的老小，早就穿上皮袄坐在炕头上烤火。这天我刚把猪喂完，圈在圈里，忽听到一阵念书声，我放下扫帚过去看一看。
    （四）一拐弯就是小学堂。我悄悄走到窗沿前去听声。看见人家孩子都拿着笔在写字，还有的拿着书本在念。我越看越眼馋。
