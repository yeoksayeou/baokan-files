　　A New Path for Popular Science Magazines
　　——Introducing "Science and Technology Communication"
　　Chen Ping

　　The "Science and Technology Communication," published by Sanlian Bookstore, is a very novel popular science publication. It is a monthly magazine, and the ninth issue has already been published this June.

　　We say that this is a very novel publication because it has some new characteristics that similar publications in our country have not had in the past.

　　First of all, its content can be combined with reality.

　　In the past, science journals, whether specialized or popular, inevitably suffered from a problem: they could not be combined with reality. Specialized journals often published scientific papers that delved into the horns of a dilemma, far removed from practical production. Popular ones, on the other hand, often selected interesting materials from British and American magazines and translated and introduced them. This kind of content might arouse some interest among the petty bourgeoisie in semi-colonial cities and some curious young students; however, this content was completely irrelevant to the broad masses of working people. However, at the very beginning, "Science and Technology Communication" put forward a direction of "combining science with production and labor" in its inaugural speech, and in practice, it is moving step by step in this direction.

　　This is a new direction. Although the content of the first and second issues of the magazine has not been able to fully follow such a new direction, some of the content is very distinctive. For example, the "Creation and Improvement" column specifically introduces new technological creations from various places, which can play a significant role in the exchange of technical experience and the encouragement of worker creativity. There are also some articles whose titles are related to reality, but whose content is not truly related to reality. For example, the article "Brain and Labor" has a very "new" title, connecting it to "labor," but the content uses cycling as an example to illustrate the relationship between the brain and body movements. There are more than just this one similar article. However, after the third issue, the content gradually became more relevant to reality, and by the seventh and eighth issues, the content was quite solid.

　　The second characteristic of "Science and Technology Communication" is that it stipulated a policy from its inception: to take technical workers as its main target audience. Because it targets technicians, the content is generally more popular, which makes it possible for workers with slightly higher cultural levels to understand it. According to what I know, among the more than one hundred technicians in the Sixth Institute of the Beijing 70th兵工厂, more than ninety have subscribed to this publication. There are even more worker readers in industrial cities in Northeast China.

　　From the content point of view, the magazine is making the greatest effort to suit the interests and needs of worker readers. For example, the "Creation and Improvement" column regularly publishes worker creations, there are many articles introducing the deeds of labor heroes, and there are also long serials suitable for use as worker technical teaching materials, such as "Common Sense of Mechanical Engineering" and "How to Draw Mechanical Drawings." From the seventh issue, a column "Technician's Scientific Common Sense" has also been added. This column is very unique, containing physical common sense, mineral common sense, medical common sense, etc. The articles are short, with many pictures, which can attract worker readers. These efforts are very valuable. But this does not mean that it has been very successful in this regard. The writing is not popular enough in many places, and even contains some classical Chinese phrases; and in terms of content, there are still some shortcomings. For example, the articles in the "Technician's Scientific Common Sense" column are good in terms of form and writing style, but many of the examples cited are not familiar to technicians or urgently needed to be understood. These shortcomings remain to be overcome by the magazine in the future. However, as a direction, the magazine has had considerable success.

　　The third characteristic of "Science and Technology Communication" is its mass line working method. Judging from the content of each issue of the magazine, we can believe that it is relatively able to implement the editorial method of coming from the readers and going to the readers. It has contacted a large number of readers and organized many correspondents from among the readers. Those who undertake this work include enthusiastic engineers, young technicians, and advanced workers from all over the country. For example, labor heroes Zhao Guoyou, Zhao Fuyou, and Dang Huian from Northeast China are all correspondents for this publication. These correspondents regularly reflect the technical situation in various places to the editorial department; report the technical creations and improvements of their units to the editorial department; write articles about their own or their colleagues' work experience to the editorial department; and at the same time, collect readers' opinions on the publication and reflect them to the editorial department. The editorial department also improves the content and improves the work in a timely manner based on these opinions. This set of mass line working methods should be adopted by any newspaper or magazine that belongs to the people. However, among scientific publications, it is probably the only one that uses this correct working method and has achieved considerable success. It is said that they have now reached the point where 90% of the materials in each issue are adopted from submissions from correspondents and readers, and they are promoting the role of "everyone contributes ideas and cooperates to run 'Science and Technology' well" among the correspondents, making the publication a publication of the readers themselves with the correspondents as the backbone.

　　For these reasons, we are willing to recommend this publication to technical workers, technicians, and engineers in factories all over the country, as well as all students in engineering and science departments in universities.

　　通俗科学杂志的新道路
    ——介绍“科学技术通讯”
    陈平
    三联书店出版的“科学技术通讯”，是一种很新颖的通俗科学刊物。这是月刊，本年六月份已经出到第九期。
    我们说这是一种很新颖的刊物，因为它具有一些新的特点，为我国向来同类刊物所没有的。
    首先是它的内容能够结合实际。
    过去的科学期刊，不论专门的或者通俗的，都难免犯一个毛病，就是不能结合实际。专门的期刊，常常刊出一些钻牛角尖的科学论文，与生产实际距离很远。通俗的呢，又常常从英美杂志上，选取一些趣味性的材料，加以翻译介绍。这种内容对于半殖民地化的都市小市民，和有些好奇心的青年学生，可能引起一些兴趣；但是，这些内容对广大劳动人民是完全无缘的。但是“科学技术通讯”在一开始时就在创刊词中提出了一个“科学与生产劳动结合起来”的方向，并且实际上朝着这方向一步步做着。
    这是一个新的方向。虽然从该刊的第一、二两期的内容来看，还没有能够完全照这样一个新的方向做，但是其中已有些内容是很特出的。例如“创造与改进”一栏，具体地介绍了各地技术上的新创造，这对技术经验的交流，对工人创造性的鼓励是能起很大的作用的。也有些文章，题目联系到实际了内容可并没有真正联系实际。例如“脑与劳动”这篇文章，题目是很“新”的，联系到了“劳动”，内容却是以骑自行车为例，来说明脑子与身体动作的关系。类似这样的文章还不止这一篇。但是从第三期之后，内容逐步地切合实际，到了第七、八期，内容已经相当结实了。
    “科学技术通讯”的第二个特点，是它从创刊起就规定了一个方针：以技术工人作为它的主要读者对象。因为以技工为对象，所以一般来说，内容都比较通俗，这样就使得文化水平稍为高一些的工人有可能看得懂。据笔者所知道，北京七十兵工厂第六所的一百多个技工中，订购这个刊物的就有九十几位。在东北各工业都市工人读者更多。
    从内容上看，该刊是在尽着最大的努力来适合工人读者的兴趣与需要的。例如“创造与改进”栏经常发表工人的创作，有很多介绍劳动英雄事迹的文章，也有适合于作工人技术教材的长篇连载，如“机械工程常识”和“怎样画机械图”等栏。从第七期起，还加辟了一栏“技工科学常识”，这一栏是很别致的，里面有物理常识、矿物常识、医药常识等等，文章短，图多，很能吸引工人读者。这些努力都是很可贵的。但这并不是说，在这方面已经做得十分成功了。文字上有许多地方不够通俗，甚至还夹杂了一些文言辞句；而且在内容上，也还有一些缺点，例如“技工科学常识”栏的文章，在形式上、写法上总算是不错的了，但所举的例子很多还不是技工所熟悉的或迫切的需要了解的。这些缺点还有待该刊今后努力来克服。不过，作为一个方向来说，该刊已经有了相当的成功。
    “科学技术通讯”的第三个特点，是它的群众路线的工作方法。从该刊的每期内容上来看，我们可以相信，它是比较能实行从读者中来，到读者中去的编辑方法的。它联系了广大的读者群众，从读者中组织了不少通讯员，担任这项工作的有热心的工程师，有年青的技术员，还有各地的先进工人。像东北劳动英雄赵国有、赵富有、党会安等，都是这个刊物的通讯员。这些通讯员经常把各地技术情况反映给编辑部；把本单位在技术上的创造与改进，报道给编辑部；把自己的或周围同志的工作经验写稿给编辑部；同时又把读者对刊物的意见集中起来反映给编辑部，编辑部也就根据这些意见，及时改进内容，改进工作。这一套群众路线的工作方法，是任何一个属于人民的报刊都应该采取的。但在科学刊物当中，运用这种正确的工作方法，而且取得了相当大的成绩的，在目前恐怕也还只有这一种。听说他们现在已经做到每期材料有百分之九十采用了通讯员和读者的投稿，而且在通讯员中，推广“大家出主意，合作办好‘科技’”的作用，使刊物成为以通讯员为骨干的、读者群众自己的刊物。
    因为这些原因，我们愿意把这个刊物推荐给各地工厂中的技术工人，技术员和工程师以及一切在大学中的工学院、理学院的同学。
