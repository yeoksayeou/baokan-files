　　Commissioned Processing, Ordering, Acquisition, Issuing Loans
    State-Owned Enterprises Support Private Enterprises
    Production and Sales in Some Industries Are Gradually Improving
    [This Newspaper's Report] The difficulties of sluggish sales and tight capital turnover faced by private enterprises in major cities across the country are gradually being alleviated through vigorous support from the People's Government, state-owned specialized companies, and state banks in the form of ordering, acquisition, commissioned processing, and loans, as well as through sincere consultations between labor and management in various industries. The production and sales situation in some industries is even showing signs of improvement.

  China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation's Commissioned Processing Significantly Increases Spindle Operation Rate Nationwide
    First, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and its local branches have been commissioning processing and purchasing products from private textile industries. The People's Government is supporting textile industries in various regions with a subsidy equivalent to 800 billion yuan, solely for imported foreign cotton and cotton yarn processing. In Shanghai, the East China Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation established processing, ordering, and purchasing relationships with more than two-thirds of the city's manufacturers in just twenty days, from May 1st to 20th. This included signing 31 contracts for commissioned spinning, allocating over 34,900 dan of raw cotton to various factories, and commissioning the spinning of over 8,500 bales of cotton yarn. This commissioned spinning alone will provide the contracted factories with labor and processing fees of over 1,848,200 real units. From May 10th, the labor and processing fee was increased from 205 Shanghai real units to 224 units, increasing the cotton discount for yarn exchange by 19 jin of cotton per bale. From January to April this year, the company allocated a total of 83,375 dan of cotton, for which it should have recovered 18,031 bales of cotton yarn; it acquired over 19,900 bales of yarn and over 991,000 bolts of cloth. In May, the amount of commissioned spinning increased to over 13,000 bales, accounting for 50% to 60% of the operating rate of private yarn mills. This has enabled the production of Shanghai's private textile industry to be maintained and gradually increase. The North China Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation also continued to sign the fourth phase of cloth-for-yarn processing contracts with Tianjin's power weaving factories on May 3rd, resolving the production and sales difficulties of over 100 weaving factories in Tianjin and enabling over 1,000 power looms to continue production. The Beijing Branch also commissioned private textile factories in Beijing to process over 71,000 bolts of cloth from January to April, incurring a loss equivalent to over 650,000 jin of millet due to the market price being lower than the cost. In addition, the cotton textile industries in Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an, and small and medium-sized cities in North China, East China, Central South, Northwest, and Southwest regions have also received support from local state-owned economic organs, and production and sales difficulties are gradually being overcome.

    China National Goods Company's Acquisition and Ordering Help Private Manufacturers Maintain Production
    Secondly, the China National Goods Company and its local branches are acquiring and ordering products from private manufacturers. According to the head office's statistics, in April, the company invested a total of 232.1 billion yuan in RMB and 2,500 bales of cotton yarn for acquiring or ordering products from private factories and commissioning processing. Of this, the East China region accounted for 148 billion yuan and 960 bales of cotton yarn; North China accounted for 40 billion yuan and 545 bales of cotton yarn. In Shanghai, the East China Goods Company acquired products from 502 private manufacturers from April to May 15th. These factories accounted for over 40% of the number of light industries operating in Shanghai, covering 17 industries including cloth, rubber, and canned goods. For example, in the rubber industry alone, from July last year to April this year, the number of manufacturers receiving acquisitions of finished products and orders from various field armies by the East China Trade Department and state-owned goods companies accounted for about 70% of the industry, and the goods accounted for about 80% of the industry's total output. In April, several dozen factories that had suspended production resumed production due to the Trade Department ordering rubber shoes and the field armies ordering raincoat cloth. The production level of towel and bed sheet industries has even exceeded 25% of pre-liberation levels. In North China, the North China Goods Company acquired products worth 34.1 billion yuan from public and private factories in Tianjin in 40 days in April and the first ten days of May, accounting for over 50% of the company's total purchases during the same period; of which, products from private factories accounted for 80%. The types of products include alkaline noodles, glass, rubber, cigarettes, paper, stationery, toothbrushes, knitwear, and chemical dyes. Among them, the prices of rubber shoes and vulcanized blue have become more reasonable due to acquisitions. In addition, state-owned department stores, fur, egg products, and pig bristle companies in various regions are also coordinating with seasonal needs, systematically acquiring rural native products, organizing the export of local specialties, and promoting a more active market in various regions.

    Ministry of Heavy Industry's Large-Scale Ordering for Machine Industry Satisfies 70% of Production Capacity
    Third, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, after the National Machine Industry Conference, allocated orders to various factories, reaching 70% of the production capacity of the national public and private machine industries for the second half of the year. The orders allocated to the private machine industry in Shanghai reached over 60% of its production capacity, and Tianjin reached over 80%. The order fees paid by the government are equivalent to 900 million jin of millet. However, most of these machines will not be used this year. The Ministry of Heavy Industry had already placed an order with the private heavy industry sector once in the spring of this year. In East China, the order for steel alone was worth 200 million jin of millet. After the Ministry of Heavy Industry allocated 2,500 tons of orders to the hardware and machine industry in Tianjin in early May, production resumed from a state of suspension and semi-suspension. The allocated orders can maintain production for three or four months. By the end of last month, over 340 of the city's 450 factories had organized themselves and established the Machine Industry United Manufacturing Factory to unify purchasing and sales and improve technology. In addition, due to receiving large orders from the Industry Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, the private steel and electrical machinery industries in Shanghai, 19 steel factories and 18 electrical machinery factories have successfully maintained production. Among them, China Iron Manufacturing Factory has been able to balance income and expenditure and can further strive for surplus.

    State Banks Issue Large Amounts of Loans to Overcome Capital Difficulties of Private Enterprises
    Fourth, while vigorously absorbing deposits, state banks have provided loan support to private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. According to statistics from the People's Bank of China, by the end of May, the balance of loans in the seven major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Chongqing alone reached 729.8 billion yuan, of which private loans accounted for 69.3%, public loans accounted for 27.5%, and cooperatives accounted for 3.2%. From January to April in Tianjin, the total amount of public and private loans reached 90.66576 billion yuan. Of this, 58 billion yuan was used to support private enterprises, and loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises accounted for 20 billion yuan in April alone. From January to April, the Bank of China in Tianjin also issued loans of 275.3 billion yuan to the export industry. Of this, over 88% was lent to private manufacturers. The Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China handled re-mortgages for private banks and businesses, accumulating over 534 billion yuan by the end of April, with a balance of over 21.4 billion yuan, directly supporting the lending of private banks and businesses and indirectly supporting private industrial and commercial enterprises. As for private industrial and commercial enterprises directly supported by the bank, public utilities are the main focus, accounting for 38%, followed by the textile and financial industries. In the past four months, the Zhejiang Provincial Branch has lent over 10 billion yuan to Hangzhou alone, solely to support legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises, of which over 84% was lent to industry. Last month, the Central South Regional Bank determined the total amount of industrial and commercial loans for the second quarter to be 200 billion yuan. The loan targets are also production, processing, transportation, and sales manufacturers engaged in the export of native products and domestic sales manufacturers of important materials, as well as private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood and have development prospects but are currently experiencing temporary capital turnover difficulties.

    Through the above-mentioned support, the arrival of the wheat harvest season, and the gradual development of urban and rural trade, the difficulties of private enterprises in major cities are being overcome, production is gradually recovering, and the phenomenon of suspension and closure is gradually ceasing. Shanghai's electricity production in May increased by 11% compared to April and 14% compared to March. Nearly one million spindles in the private cotton textile industry have begun to turn, and the second week of May produced over 12% more cloth than the fourth week of April. Of the 31 steel smelting industries, 29 had started operations in May, and the other two were preparing to resume production. The situation of suspension, closure, or bankruptcy in Tianjin's major industrial sectors has basically ceased. The private industrial and commercial sector in Beijing is also gradually moving towards normal development. In the future, under the central government's policy of adjusting the five types of economy and implementing overall planning, private enterprises will definitely be able to completely overcome temporary difficulties and move towards normal recovery and development.

　　委托加工·定货·收购·发放贷款
    国营企业扶植私营企业
    部分行业产销情况日趋好转
    【本报讯】全国各大城市私营企业产品滞销和资金周转不灵的困难，经过人民政府和国营各专业公司以及国家银行定货、收购、委托加工和贷款等的大力扶植，及各行业劳资双方开诚协商，已在逐步减轻；部分行业的产销情况且已日趋好转。
  中国花纱布公司的委托加工使全国纱锭开动率大为增加
    首先是中国花纱布公司及其所属各地分支公司对私营纺织业的委托加工和收购产品。人民政府仅是外棉进口和棉纱加工，即以八千亿元的赔累扶植各地的纺织业。在上海，华东区花纱布公司从五月一日到二十日二十天中，即与全市三分之二以上的厂家，建立了加工、订货、收购等关系。其中共签代纺合约三十一份，配售各厂原棉三万四千九百余市担，代纺棉纱八千五百余件。单就此项代纺来说，各签约厂即可得到工缴费一百八十四万八千二百余个折实单位。工缴费于五月十日起，又从二○五个上海折实单位，提高至二二四个单位，使以纱易棉的折价每件可增加十九斤棉花。该公司今年一至四月共配棉八万三千三百七十五担，应收回棉纱计一万八千零三十一件；共收购纱一万九千九百余件，布九十九万一千余匹。五月间代纺数额且已增至一万三千余件，占私营纱厂开工率的百分之五十至六十。因而使上海私营纺织业的生产得以维持和逐渐上升。华北区花纱布公司亦于五月三日继续与津市电力织布工厂分组签订了第四期以布换纱的加工合同，使津市一百多家织布厂的产销困难获得解决，使一千多台电力机得以继续维持生产。北京分公司也曾于一至四月份委托京市私营纺织厂加工布七万一千余匹，且因市价低于成本，亏损折小米达六十五万余斤。此外，武汉、重庆、西安及华北、华东、中南、西北、西南等区各中小城市的棉纺织业，亦均受到各该地国营经济机关的扶持，产销困难亦在逐步克服。
    中国百货公司收购定货帮助私营厂商维持生产
    其次是中国百货公司及其所属各地分支公司对私营厂商产品的收购和定货。据总公司统计，四月份内，该公司为收购或订购私营工厂的产品和委托加工等，共投放人民币二千三百二十一亿元和棉纱二千五百件。其中华东区即占一千四百八十亿元，棉纱九百六十件；华北占四百亿元，棉纱五百四十五件。华东区百货公司在上海从四月份起到五月十五日止，对私营厂商五百零二家进行了收购产品。这些工厂即占上海轻工业开工数的百分之四十强，计有布匹、橡胶、罐头等十七个行业。其中只橡胶业在去年七月至今年四月，得到华东贸易部和国营百货公司收购成品和各野战军定货的厂商的数目，就约占该业的百分之七十，货品约占该业总产量的百分之八十。四月份内，有三十几家停工的工厂，因贸易部定购胶鞋和野战军定购雨衣布而复工。毛巾、被单等业，且因之生产水平超过了解放前的百分之二十五。华北区百货公司四月份和五月上旬四十天中，在天津收购的公私营工厂产品，价值即达三百四十一亿元，占该公司同一时期内进货总额的百分之五十以上；其中私营工厂的产品即占百分之八十。其产品种类包括碱面、玻璃、橡胶、纸烟、纸张、文具、牙刷、针织品、化学染料等。其中胶鞋、硫化青等价格因经收购而趋向了合理。此外，各地国营百货、皮毛、蛋品、猪鬃等公司，亦均为配合季节需要，有计划地收购农村土产，组织土产特产外销，促使各地市场转趋活跃。
    重工业部对机器业大批定货满足百分之七十的生产能力
    第三，中央人民政府重工业部经过全国机器工业会议，分配给各厂的定货，达到了全国公私机器业下半年生产能力的百分之七十。上海私营机器业分配的定货达到其生产力的百分之六十以上，天津达到百分之八十以上。政府支出的定货费折小米达九亿斤。而这些机器的大部分今年还是不用的。重工业部且在今年春季已向私营重工业定货一次。在华东，仅钢材一项定货即值小米二亿斤。津市五金机器业五月初经重工业部分配定货二千五百吨后，即由停工和半停工状态中恢复了生产。分配的定货可维持三、四个月的生产。上月底，全市四百五十家工厂已有三百四十余家组织起来，成立了机器工业联合制造厂，以统一购销，改进技术。此外，上海私营钢铁、电机两业，由于收到华东军政委员会工业部的大宗订货，已有十九家钢铁厂和十八家电机厂顺利地维持了生产。其中中华制铁厂已能收支相抵，且可进一步争取盈余。
    国家银行发放大量贷款克服私营企业资金困难
    第四，国家银行在大力吸收存款的同时，对有利于国计民生的私营工商业，进行了贷款扶植。据中国人民银行统计，到五月底止，仅京、津、沪、汉、广州、西安、重庆七大城市，贷款余额即达七千二百九十八亿元，其中私营贷款即占百分之六九·三，公营贷款占百分之二七·五，合作社占百分之三·二。天津一至四月份，公私贷款总额达九百零六亿六千五百七十六万元。其中五百八十亿元是用之于扶助私营企业的，私营工商业贷款在四月份即占二百亿元。津市中国银行一至四月份，亦对出口业发放贷款二千七百五十三亿元。其中百分之八十八以上是贷给私营厂商的。人民银行上海分行对私营行庄办理了转抵押，四月底累计达五千零三十四亿余元，余额达二百十四亿余元，直接支持了私营行庄的放款，间接扶助了私营工商业。至于直接受该行扶植的私营工商业，以公用事业为主，占百分之三十八，纺织、金融等业次之。浙江省分行近四个月来的放款，仅用以扶植正当工商业的，杭市一地即达一百亿元以上，其中贷给工业的占百分之八十四强。中南区行在上月中曾确定第二季工商贷款总额为二千亿元。贷款对象亦为经营出口土产的生产、加工、运销和重要物资的内销厂商，以及有利于国计民生且有发展前途而目前暂时遭遇资金周转困难的私营企业。
    各大城市的私营企业，经过上述的扶植，麦收季节的到来，城乡贸易的逐渐开展，困难已在克服，生产也已逐渐恢复，停工、歇业的现象正在逐渐停止。上海市的电力生产量，五月份已比四月份增加了百分之十一，比三月份增加了百分之十四。私营棉纺业近百万纱锭已开始转动，五月份第二周即比四月份第四周多产布百分之十二以上。三十一家钢铁炼制工业，五月份开工的已达二十九家，其他两家正在准备复工。天津的主要工业行业的停工、歇业或倒闭的情况，已经基本上停止。京市私营工商业亦正逐步走向正常的发展。今后在中央人民政府调整五种经济、实行统筹兼顾的方针下，私营企业定能完全克服暂时的困难，趋向正常的恢复和发展。
