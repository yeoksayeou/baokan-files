Speech at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
April 21, 1950
Speech by Liu Changsheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions
(Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd) Liu Changsheng, member of the National Committee and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the following speech at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's People's Political Consultative Conference on April 21st:

Chairman, fellow members, comrades:

After listening to the reports from the leading comrades of the Central People's Government, we are very happy to see that our country has achieved a series of great victories in military, political, and economic affairs in just eight months. Not only has the mainland of the country been basically liberated, but also the management system of national finance and economy has been unified and centralized leadership has been implemented. As a result, we have achieved near balance in fiscal revenue and expenditure, the cessation of currency inflation, and the stabilization of prices, demonstrating the beginning of improvement in the financial and economic situation, and laying a preliminary foundation for striving for a fundamental improvement in the national financial and economic situation.

Here, we also focus on discussing the central topic of this conference—the land reform issue. This is a great joyous event for the people of our country. This is a matter of resolving the issue of improving the lives of the vast number of working peasants, and at the same time, it is a matter of unleashing their great productive forces in the national economy. Our working class firmly supports the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China." We are willing to vigorously support the land reform work. We are willing to work together with our laboring peasant brothers to complete the great historical task of "abolishing the feudal exploitation of land ownership by the landlord class and implementing the land ownership of the peasants, thereby liberating rural productive forces, developing agricultural production, and opening up avenues for the industrialization of new China." Because this work is of great significance to the fundamental improvement of our country's entire financial and economic situation and to future comprehensive development.

In such a situation, how should our working class strive for the fundamental improvement of the national financial and economic situation?

(1) First of all, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and do a good job of production in state-owned and private enterprises "without discrimination." That is to say, within state-owned and public enterprises, through the workers' representative conferences and factory management committees, we must continue to maintain a leading role over private enterprises in terms of production management, production quantity and quality, and labor discipline. At the same time, production competitions and labor hero model movements should also be launched in private enterprises.

(2) Adjust labor-capital relations based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality between labor and capital: In the past, our shortcomings were that we did not grasp the crucial key of doing a good job in production as the central point for adjusting labor-capital relations. On the contrary, sometimes when dealing with labor-capital disputes, we lacked a comprehensive perspective and did not combine today's interests with tomorrow's interests, or partial interests with overall interests. As a result, in a certain short period in the past, in terms of struggle methods, we only knew the set of "you escape, I surround; the more you escape, the more I surround" which were mutually opposed. This is unnecessary. This can only make our path narrower and narrower. In the end, it only aggravated the complexity of the problem. The capitalists also have shortcomings, such as not being willing to patiently discuss ways to overcome difficulties with the workers in an open and honest manner until the very last minute, but simply demanding how the other party should act, or simply relying on the government and pushing the responsibility onto the government. The most unacceptable thing is to adopt a passive attitude. It should be known that one's own passivity will affect the other party's enthusiasm. As for unilaterally hoping that the government will solve the difficulties for me, while not coming up with any solutions myself, this is unfair. It should be known that the current government represents all the people and serves us equally. There must be a comprehensive perspective of mutual consideration among the people of all walks of life, in order to achieve mutual unity and concentrate our efforts to do a good job in production. Based on our existing experience: To do a good job in the production of private enterprises, on the one hand, labor and capital must have the spirit of sharing weal and woe, and an honest and sincere attitude, and jointly and democratically negotiate. On the other hand, we must concentrate our efforts, face production, and everyone actively put forward concrete opinions. As long as the capitalists express confidence and determination to transform their management, then the workers will more actively come up with various ways to support the capitalists. The workers' spirit of hard work, endurance and sacrifice is admirable. There are many facts in Shanghai that can prove this. In this way, there is no fear of not doing a good job in production. If production is done well, there is no need to worry about labor-capital relations.

Currently, both labor and capital in Shanghai generally recognize that the labor-capital consultation conference is the best organizational form for adjusting labor-capital relations, strengthening labor-capital unity, and doing a good job in production. This is the result and progress of the efforts of labor and capital over the past year. But we must give full play to the due role of the labor-capital consultation conference within enterprises, and not allow it to become a mere formality, or simply biased towards mediating disputes. We must place the work center of the labor-capital consultation conference on doing a good job in production. In order to make the conference better, we must be fully prepared in advance, and be able to discuss issues realistically and concretely during the meeting, and when deciding on issues, we must have practical and feasible methods and steps, so that we have the power to mobilize both labor and capital to seriously and responsibly implement the resolutions.

(3) We must strengthen trade union work. Our work in the previous stage, the large-scale organization of workers, was successful. But in the later stage, delving deeper into the work has become slow and laborious. We are nostalgic for the spectacular set of things in the early days of liberation, unaccustomed to, and even impatient with, the practical, in-depth, and consolidated style. Our trade union work must improve its professional level; we must greatly promote the democratic style; we must learn how to work well with the vast number of members, and oppose the phenomenon of monopolizing everything; we must pay attention to the issues that most workers and staff members care about most, especially production issues; our daily work must continue to implement the unity of all workers and staff, especially the unity of technical personnel; only in this way can we give full play to the power of the working class, and thus learn to manage enterprises and do a good job in production. Only by closely linking with the broad masses, strengthening the leading role of trade unions at all levels, improving the grassroots organizations, enriching the trade union ranks and content, and cultivating our professional ability to run trade unions well, can we truly make our work move towards a step of depth, consolidation, and improvement. Only in this way can we better shoulder the arduous task of maintaining and developing production.

We are fully confident that, based on Chairman Mao's "without discrimination" instructions, and on the basis of existing progress and unity, we will take the initiative to consciously unite all democratic classes. We will resolutely implement all the resolutions of the Central People's Government, and strive to overcome the shortcomings in our work. Under the victorious banner of our working class's own political party—the Chinese Communist Party, and our leader—Chairman Mao, we will work together with people from all walks of life to complete the fundamental improvement of our new China's national financial and economic situation!

　　人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言
    一九五○年四月二十一日
    上海市总工会主席
    刘长胜的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】全国委员会委员、上海市总工会主席刘长胜二十一日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席，各位委员，各位同志：
    我们听取了中央人民政府各位首长的报告后，感到非常高兴，我们的国家，在短短的八个月中，在军事上、政治上、经济上均已取得一连串的伟大胜利。不只基本的解放了全国大陆，而且统一了国家财政经济的管理制度和集中领导。因而获得了财政收支接近平衡、通货停止膨胀、物价趋向稳定，表现了财政经济情况的开始好转，为争取国家财政经济情况的基本好转，奠定了初步的基础。
    在这里，我们也着重的讨论了这次会议的中心议题——土地改革问题。这是我国人民非常兴奋的一件大喜事。这是要解决广大劳动农民靠以改善生活，同时也是靠以发挥在国民经济中伟大生产力的问题。我们工人阶级坚决拥护“中华人民共和国土地改革法”。我们愿以大力支持土改工作。我们愿以大力同劳动农民弟兄们共同完成：“废除地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制，实行农民的土地所有制，借以解放农村生产力，发展农业生产，为新中国的工业化开辟道路”的历史的伟大工作。因为这个工作，有关我国整个财政经济的基本好转，与今后全面的发展，有着重大意义的。
    在这样的情况下，我们工人阶级如何来为着国家财政经济的基本好转而奋斗呢？
    （一）首先我们要本着毛主席所指示，把国营与私营企业的生产“一视同仁”的搞好。这就是说：在国营公营企业内，通过职工代表会议暨工厂管理委员会，必须达到在生产管理上、生产数量与质量上、以及劳动纪律上、继续保持对私营企业的领导作用，同时在私营企业内同样应当展开生产竞赛，及劳动英模运动。
    （二）以劳资两利、平等的原则，调整劳资关系：过去我们有过的缺点，是没有抓住搞好生产，作为调整劳资关系的中心关键，相反，我们有时在处理劳资争议时，缺乏全面观点，没有把今天的利益同明天的利益，把局部利益与全体利益结合起来，以致过去在某一短时期内在斗争方式上，只知道你逃避我包围，你越逃避我越包围相互对立的一套。这是不必要的。这只能使我们的路越走越狭。结果反而加重了问题的复杂化。资方也有缺点，如不到万分时总不愿同工人开诚布公的耐心的商讨，克服困难的办法，只是简单的要求对方如何、如何，或者简单的依赖政府，把责任推到政府身上。最要不得的是采取消极的态度。须知，自己消极就影响对方的积极。至于单面的希望政府，替我解决困难，而自己却不拿出办法来，这是不公平的。须知现在的政府，是代表全体人民一视同仁的给我们办事的。我们各界人民之间，就必须要有相互照顾的全面观点。才能达到相互团结，集中力量，搞好生产。根据我们已有的经验：要搞好私营企业的生产，一面劳资双方必须有同舟共济的精神，坦白诚恳的态度，共同民主的协商。另一面就必须集中力量，面对生产，大家积极的提出具体意见，只要资方表示有信心有改造经营的决心，那末工人会更积极的拿出各种办法来支持资方。工人们吃苦耐劳的牺牲精神是令人敬佩的。这在上海是有很多事实可作证明的。这样就不怕搞不好生产。搞好了生产，劳资关系也就用不着担心。
    目前上海劳资双方都公认：劳资协商会议，为调整劳资关系，加强劳资团结，搞好生产的最好的组织形式，这是劳资双方经过一年来努力的结果和进步。但我们必须发挥企业内，劳资协商会议应有的作用。不使它流于形式，或单纯的偏于调解纠纷方面。必须把劳资协商会议的工作中心，放在搞好生产方面。为要把会议开得更好些，就要在事先有充分准备，在开会时能够实事求是的，具体讨论问题，在决定问题时，能够有结合实际可行的办法和步骤，因而就有力量，动员劳资双方起来，认真负责的执行决议。
    （三）我们必须加强工会工作，我们的工作，在前一阶段，大刀阔斧的组织工人，是有成绩的。但在后一阶段，把工作深入下去，就表示迟缓而吃力。我们留恋于解放初期轰轰烈烈的一套，对切实深入巩固的作风不习惯，甚至不耐烦。我们的工会工作业务水平必须提高；我们必须大大发扬民主作风；我们要学会如何善于同广大会员一道工作，反对包办代替现象；我们一定要关心大多数工人和职员最最关心的问题，尤其是生产问题；我们的日常工作，必须继续贯彻团结全体工人和职员，尤其是团结技术人员；也只有这样，我们才能发挥出工人阶级的力量。因而学会管理企业和搞好生产。只有这样亲密的联系广大群众；加强各级工会的领导作用，健全基层组织；充实工运的阵容和内容；培养我们办好工会的业务能力，也只有这样，才能使我们的工作，真正走上深入、巩固和提高一步。才能更好的担负起维持和发展生产的艰巨任务。
    我们完全有信心，根据毛主席“一视同仁”的指示，在已有的进步和团结的基础上，主动的自觉的团结各民主阶级。坚决贯彻中央人民政府的一切决议，和努力克服我们工作上的缺点。在我们工人阶级自己的政党——中国共产党，及我们的领袖——毛主席的胜利旗帜下，与各界人民在一起共同为完成我们新中国的国家财政经济的基本好转而奋斗！
