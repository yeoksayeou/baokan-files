Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (Reported by Chen Shutong on June 14th at the Second Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC)

Fellow members, fellow comrades:

I present this work report to our meeting on behalf of the Standing Committee.

According to Article 13 of the Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the work of the National Committee, as Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai reported at the last meeting, can be roughly divided into two categories: one is policy-related, and the other is organization-related. After the last meeting, the Standing Committee did some work, but it was not enough. Especially at the beginning, due to the busy schedule of the government work on all fronts, the work of our committee had a phenomenon of relaxation. The work situation is now reported as follows:

I. Important proposals from the successive meetings of the Central People's Government Committee have been discussed by the Standing Committee in consultation with the relevant responsible parties. Among them, the 1950 national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, have been carefully consulted.

II. The work of the various groups has gradually been established, except for the National Defense Group (the group leader is sick, and only three members are in Beijing, making it impossible to hold meetings). The issues researched and discussed by the groups include the following. Those belonging to the Political and Legal Group include: Draft General Rules for the Organization of People's Representative Conferences at All Levels, Draft Interim Measures for the Registration of Social Organizations, Draft Trade Union Law of China, Draft Instructions of the Central Ministry of Labor on the Establishment of Labor-Management Consultation Meetings in Private Enterprises, Draft Interim Organizational Rules for Provincial and Municipal Labor Bureaus, Draft Organizational Rules for Municipal Labor Introduction Offices, Draft Agricultural Tax Regulations for Newly Liberated Areas, and Draft Measures for Summer Grain Collection. Those belonging to the Financial and Economic Group include: Issuance of Public Bonds, Publicity for Public Bonds, Private and Overseas Chinese Investment, Draft Agricultural Tax Regulations for Newly Liberated Areas, and Draft Measures for Summer Grain Collection. Those belonging to the Cultural and Educational Group include: Draft Instructions of the State Council on Launching Vocational and Technical Education, and the Work Plan of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council for 1950. Those belonging to the Foreign Affairs Group include: Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation Agreement. Those belonging to the Ethnic Affairs Group include: The current situation of fraternal ethnic groups and the principles of ethnic policies and ethnic work. Those belonging to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Group include: Policies for protecting Overseas Chinese. Those belonging to the Religious Affairs Group include: Reform guidelines for Christian church work. These studies and discussions were either initiated by the groups or entrusted by the State Council and relevant ministries and commissions, with the latter being in the majority. The State Council and relevant departments provided materials and sent personnel to attend and report. Therefore, the good work of the groups has been of much help to the government. Some groups have begun communicating with members who are not in Beijing, and some groups have also tried to collect opinions outside the meetings, which will make the content of each group's work richer.

III. After the last meeting, we immediately started to organize the Secretariat and began various tasks. In mid-March, we further established a weekly work meeting composed of the Secretary-General, the heads of each group, the Deputy Secretary-General, and the heads of the Secretariat. The task of the work meeting, in addition to organizing and promoting the daily work within the meeting, is to conduct preliminary consultations on issues related to united front work raised by a certain unit or several units participating in the CPPCC. When conducting such consultations, relevant units are invited to send representatives to attend. The results of the consultations are reported to the Chairman for instructions. The motions approved by the Chairman after this consultation procedure include the decision on the funding of local organizations of the democratic parties and the decision on bi-weekly symposiums and learning symposiums. These are some of the important ones. In addition, we also organized symposiums for the headquarters of various democratic parties to meet separately with the local united front workers of the CPC to discuss the work and relationship of the local organizations of the democratic parties.

IV. Bi-weekly symposiums are political symposiums initiated by the China Democratic League, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the China National Democratic Construction Association, and are mainly attended by representatives sent by the headquarters of the various democratic parties and people's organizations participating in the CPPCC, as well as members of the National Committee's Standing Committee. Two sessions have been held, both focusing on the documents "Stalin and Mao Zedong on Communists' Ability to Unite and Cooperate with Non-Party Masses" and "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" promulgated by the CPC Central Committee, in connection with the review of general united front work and the implementation of the Common Program. Minister Li Weihan of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee reported on the main points of the United Front Work Conference. This symposium has not yet concluded and will continue to be held.

V. Learning symposiums are initiated by the headquarters of various democratic parties and organized jointly by our committee. Participants are senior personnel in Beijing from the Central People's Government, the democratic parties and people's organizations participating in the CPPCC, and the National Committee, based on the principle of voluntary participation. As of now, there are more than 200 participants. It is planned to study methodology of thinking, the history of social development, theories of the state, and issues of the Chinese revolution. We have started studying the methodology of thinking, and the situation is extremely enthusiastic. The methods include self-study, large reports, and group discussions, and participants are free to choose without constraint.

VI. The biggest shortcoming in our work is that the connection between the National Committee and the local consultative bodies has not yet been formally established. We have received a number of complaints from citizens regarding local administrative matters or administrative personnel and have decided to refer them to the relevant competent authorities of the Central Government (People's Supervision Committee, Supreme People's Court, or Supreme People's Procuratorate) for handling. We have also received a number of documents from local consultative committees, but have not processed them because there are still no specific regulations in this regard. Now the Standing Committee has submitted to our meeting a draft decision on the local committees, requesting review and approval. After this decision is reviewed and approved, the relationship between the National Committee and the local consultative bodies will be formally established and become closer, and the work of the National Committee will thus be enriched and developed.

These are the specific tasks of the Standing Committee. It has fulfilled a certain responsibility for consolidating the united front and assisting the government's work.

Fellow members, fellow comrades, this meeting will successively hear reports on political, military, land reform, financial and economic, cultural and educational, and court work, and will adopt various proposals to be submitted to the Central People's Government Committee. All of this powerfully proves to the people of the whole country that under the leadership of the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, our country's people's liberation war, the reform and construction of politics, economy, and culture, have all achieved new victories and great achievements. Naturally, there are still many difficulties on the road ahead, but these are difficulties brought about by development. Relying on the unity and efforts of the people of the whole country, we will certainly be able to overcome these difficulties victoriously. There are also many shortcomings in practical work, but these are shortcomings that occur in the initial work of a young country. Relying on the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, we will certainly be able to effectively correct these shortcomings. The general guideline for the work of the National Committee is to unite all democratic forces to ensure the realization of the Common Program and the policies, laws, resolutions, and instructions of the Central People's Government, and to assist the Central People's Government in overcoming difficulties and shortcomings in practical work. Our work, whether in terms of policy or organization, must be subordinate to this purpose. Our study is also for this purpose.

My report is finished.

　　人民政协全国委员会常务委员会工作报告
    （陈叔通六月十四日在人民政协全国委员会二次会议上报告）
    【新华社十七日讯】中国人民政协全国委员会副主席陈叔通十四日在第一届全国委员会第二次会议上作全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，全文如下：各位委员，各位同志：
    我代表常务委员会向我们的会议提出工作报告。
    依据中国人民政治协商会议组织法第十三条的规定，全国委员会的工作如本会周恩来副主席在上次会议上的报告，大致可分为两大类，一类属于政策性方面的，一类属于组织性方面的。上次会议后，常务委员会做了一些工作，但做得不够，特别在开始的时候，因各方面忙于政府工作，致本会工作有放松的现象。现在将工作情况报告于后：
    一、中央人民政府委员会历次会议的重要议案，都经过常务委员会与有关负责方面的协商。其中一九五零年度全国财政收支概算，中苏友好同盟互助条约，中华人民共和国婚姻法等，更经过慎重的协商。
    二、各小组的工作，除国防组（组长生病，只有三个委员在京，无法开会）外，都已逐步地建立起来。各小组研究和讨论过的问题，计有以下各种。属于政治法律组的有：地方各界人民代表会议组织通则草案，社会团体登记暂行办法草案，中国工会法草案，中央劳动部关于在私营企业中设立劳资协商会议的指示草案，省、市劳动局暂行组织通则草案，市劳动介绍所组织通则草案，新解放区农业税条例草案，夏季征粮办法草案等。属于财政经济组的有：公债发行，公债宣传，私人及华侨投资，新解放区农业税条例草案，夏季征粮办法草案等。属于文化教育组的有：政务院关于开展职工业余教育的指示草案，政务院文教委员会一九五○年工作计划。属于外交组的有：中苏经济合作协定。属于民族事务组的有：目前兄弟民族情况及民族政策和民族工作的方针。属于华侨事务组的有：护侨政策。属于宗教事务组的有：基督教教会工作的改革方针。这些研究和讨论，或由小组发动，或由政务院及有关部、会的委托，而以后者占多数，政务院及有关部门供给材料并派员出席报告。所以小组工作做得好，对政府自有许多的帮助。有些小组已开始和不在京的委员通讯，有些小组并设法搜集会外意见，这将使各组工作的内容更为丰富起来。
    三、上次会议后，即着手组织秘书处，开始各项工作。三月中旬进一步建立了由秘书长、各组组长、副秘书长及正副秘书处长组成的每周一次的工作会议。工作会议的任务，除组织和推动会内日常工作外，并得对于参加人民政协的某一单位或几个单位所提出的有关统一战线工作的问题，进行初步协商。进行此种协商时，邀请有关单位派代表出席，协商结果报请主席指示处理。经过这种协商手续，最后经主席批准成立的议案，有关于各民主党派地方组织经费的决定，双周座谈会和学习座谈会的决定。这是重要的几件。此外，并组织了各民主党派总部分别与中共各地统战工作人员的座谈会，座谈各民主党派地方组织的工作和关系。
    四、双周座谈会，这是民主同盟、中国国民党革命委员会和民主建国会等所发起，而由参加人民政协的各民主党派、各人民团体总部所派出的代表及全国委员会常务委员为主体的时事政治座谈会。已举行过两次，皆以中共中央颁布的“斯大林、毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作”的文件及“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”为主题，联系到一般统一战线工作和共同纲领实施情况的检讨。曾由中共中央统一战线工作部李维汉部长报告过统一战线工作会议的要点。此项座谈尚未结束，还将赓续举行。
    五、学习座谈会，这是各民主党派总部所发起而由本会参加筹备组成的。参加学习者为中央人民政府、参加人民政协的民主党派和人民团体、及全国委员会等在京的高级人员，而以自愿参加为原则，截至目前止已达二百余人。拟学习思想方法论、社会发展史、国家学说及中国革命问题。已开始思想方法论的学习，情况至为热烈。方法分自习、大报告及小组讨论，亦听各人自愿取舍，不加拘束。
    六、我们工作中的最大缺点，在于全国委员会同地方协商机关的联系，至今没有正式建立起来。我们接到过若干公民对于地方行政方面或行政人员的申诉，决定分别交由中央政府有关主管机关（人民监察委员会，最高人民法院或最高人民检察署）处理。我们也接到过若干地方协商委员会的来件，却未曾处理，因为这方面还缺少具体办法的规定。现在常务委员会向我们的会议提出了关于地方委员会的决定草案，请求审查和通过。在这个决定审查通过之后，全国委员会同地方协商机关的关系就会正式建立和密切起来，而全国委员会的工作，也将因此更加充实起来和发展起来。
    关于常务委员会的具体工作，就是这些。这对于巩固统一战线和协助政府工作，是尽了一定责任的。
    各位委员，各位同志们，本次会议将陆续听取关于政治、军事、土地改革、财政经济、文化教育和法院工作等报告，并将通过向中央人民政府委员会提出的各种建议案。这一切就向全国人民有力地证明了，在以毛泽东主席为首的中央人民政府领导之下，我们国家的人民解放战争，政治、经济和文化的改革与建设，都取得了新的胜利和大的成就。自然，在前进道路上还存在着许多困难，但这是发展中带来的困难，倚靠全国人民的团结和努力，我们一定能够胜利地战胜这些困难。在实际工作中也还存在着许多缺点，但这是年青国家在初期工作中发生的缺点，倚靠批评和自我批评的武器，我们一定能够有效地纠正这些缺点。全国委员会工作的总方针，就是要团结一切民主力量，去保证共同纲领和中央人民政府的政策、法令、决议和指示的实现，协助中央人民政府克服实际工作中的困难和缺点。我们的工作，不论是政策性方面的和组织性方面的，都要服从这个目的。我们的学习，也是为着这个目的。
    我的报告完了。
