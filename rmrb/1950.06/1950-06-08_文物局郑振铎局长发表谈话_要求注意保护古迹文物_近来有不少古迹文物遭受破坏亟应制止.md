Xinhua News Agency, June 6th. Recently, incidents of damage to historical sites and cultural relics have occurred frequently. Zheng Zhenduo, Director of the Bureau of Cultural Relics of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, issued a statement calling on local authorities, troops, organizations, and active members of the people to pay attention to the protection of historical sites and cultural relics. Director Zheng's statement is as follows:

"Recently, many historical sites and cultural relics have been damaged. This is a significant loss of the country's valuable wealth and must be effectively stopped urgently. For example, the Yin Ruins in Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, and dozens of ancient tombs of the Six Dynasties, the tomb of Consort Li Xian, and the tomb of Mu Ying in the Niushou Mountain area of Nanjing, as well as the Liao tombs in Yixian and Fuxin in Liaoxi Province, Northeast China, have been excavated by local people, and many unearthed cultural relics have been lost. The Huata Pagoda of Guanghui Temple in Zhengding, Hebei Province, built in the Jin Dynasty, is extremely important in the history of Chinese architecture, but it was recently demolished. The Great Samantabhadra Hall of Guangji Temple in Baodi, Hebei Province, built in the fifth year of the Taiping reign of Emperor Shengzong of the Liao Dynasty (1025), was also demolished, and the wood was used to pave bridges. The Haihui Hall of the Lower Huayan Temple in Datong, Chahar Province, also built in the Liao Dynasty, was demolished by the principal of the Xiapo Temple Elementary School, who used the wood to build another house; the brightly colored caisson ceiling in the hall was also dismantled piece by piece and made into dustpans.

"Since the forces of imperialism invaded China, our cultural relics and books have been massively stolen and exported for a long period. Comprador merchants colluded with local bullies to privately dig ancient tombs and steal wooden and stone statues from ancient ancestral halls and temples for export. The Kuomintang reactionary government not only did not prohibit this, but also arbitrarily allowed imperialist scholars to engage in excavation and acquisition in our country. The Kuomintang reactionary government itself also stole many ancient artifacts and transported them abroad for private sale, causing significant losses to the nation's historical heritage. Fortunately, this situation has now fundamentally changed. The Central People's Government attaches great importance to historical sites and cultural relics, and local governments at all levels are also paying attention to this. Some provincial governments have issued special orders for the protection of historical sites and cultural relics, and some cities have intercepted many ancient artifacts intended for private export. However, there are still a few people who fail to recognize the importance of ancient architecture and other cultural relics, or demolish ancient buildings for 'waste utilization,' or excavate ancient tombs for 'production,' acting arbitrarily and causing damage to many historical sites and cultural relics. The above examples are only those known to us. We hope that local authorities, troops, organizations, and all the people will quickly take effective measures to protect all historical sites and cultural relics, prevent damage and unscientific excavation; those that have been damaged or are being damaged should be cleaned up in a timely manner and resolutely stopped; and we hope that people's governments at all levels and cultural and news organizations will widely publicize the significance of protecting ancient cultural relics so that the people can automatically and consciously assist the government in jointly protecting historical sites and cultural relics."

　　文物局郑振铎局长发表谈话
    要求注意保护古迹文物
    近来有不少古迹文物遭受破坏亟应制止
    【新华社六日讯】近来古迹、文物被毁损事件发生颇多，中央人民政府文化部文物局郑振铎局长为此发表谈话，要求各地机关、部队、团体和人民中的积极分子一致注意保护古迹文物。郑局长谈话如下：
    “近来有不少古迹文物遭受破坏，这是国家宝贵财富的重大损失，亟应予以有效的制止。例如平原省安阳县的殷墟，南京牛首山一带六朝古坟、李贤妃墓、沐英墓等数十座，东北辽西省的义县、阜新的辽墓，均为当地人民所发掘，出土古物，散失颇多。河北省正定的广惠寺华塔，为金代建造，在我国建筑史上极为重要，最近竟被拆毁。河北省宝坻的广济寺三大士殿，为辽圣宗太平五年（一二○五年）所建，亦被拆毁，将木材作为铺桥之用。察哈尔省大同的下华岩寺海慧殿，亦为辽代所建筑，被下坡寺小学校长拆毁，将木材另建一屋；殿中色彩鲜明的藻井，也被一块块拆下作了畚箕。
    “自帝国主义势力侵入中国以来，我国的文物图书在长期间曾被大量盗运出口，买办奸商更勾结土劣私掘古墓，盗窃古祠庙的木石雕像，贩卖出口。国民党反动政府不但不加禁止，并擅自准许帝国主义学者在我国从事发掘、收购；国民党反动政府本身也将许多古物盗运国外，私自出卖，造成民族历史遗产的重大损失。所幸现在这种情况已经根本转变。中央人民政府是十分重视古迹文物的，各级地方政府也多能注意及此，有些省政府发了保护古迹文物的专门命令，若干城市截留了许多打算私运出口的古物。但仍有少数人不能认识古代建筑等文物之重要，或为“利用废物”而拆毁古建筑，或为“生产”而发掘古墓葬，任意妄为，致不少古迹文物受到破坏；上举各例，仅为我们所已知者。希望各地机关、部队、团体和全体人民，对所有古迹、文物迅速采取有效办法，加意保护，防止毁坏与非科学方法的发掘；对已经被毁坏或正在被毁坏者应及时加以清理和坚决制止；并望各级人民政府及文化、新闻机构就保护古代文物之意义加以广泛宣传，使人民自动自觉协助政府共同保护古迹文物。”
