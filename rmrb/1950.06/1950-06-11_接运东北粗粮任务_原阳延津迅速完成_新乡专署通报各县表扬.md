[Xinxiang News] The first batch of 840,000 jin of Northeast miscellaneous grains allocated to the Xinxiang Special District by the Pingyuan Provincial Financial and Economic Committee has been transported from Xinxiang Station by Yuanyang, Yanjin, and Huixian counties. After receiving the task, the three counties immediately convened meetings of district chiefs to discuss and specifically arrange the steps and procedures for receiving, transporting, and distributing the grain. On May 20th, Yuanyang and Yanjin counties learned that the grain had arrived at Xinxiang Station, so they notified the districts to send people to the station to collect the grain in sequence from the 21st, and they successfully completed the transportation task by the 24th. Huixian County learned of the task later and had a larger task, but it was also completed by the 27th. The reason why this task could be completed so quickly is mainly because the task itself meets the needs of the masses, who are willing to guarantee the exchange of coarse grains for wheat and cotton. Secondly, sufficient preparation and careful planning were made in advance, and the arduousness of the task was clearly recognized. Medical personnel and veterinarians were equipped along the way, boiled water stations were set up, guards were dispatched, and strong cadres were assigned to be responsible for command and leadership, so fewer problems occurred. In particular, Yuanyang and Yanjin counties performed the best, and the Commissioner's Office has issued a notice calling on other counties to learn from these two counties.

    接运东北粗粮任务
    原阳延津迅速完成
    新乡专署通报各县表扬
    【本报新乡讯】平原省财经委员会拨给新乡专区的东北杂粮，首批八十四万斤，已由原阳、延津、辉县自新乡车站接运完毕。该三县接获任务后，即召集各区区长开会讨论，并具体布置接运、分发步骤和手续。五月二十日，原阳、延津两县得悉粮食已到达新乡车站，遂通知各区自二十一日起依次出动赴车站取粮，至二十四日即胜利完成接运任务。辉县因得悉较晚，且任务也较大，但至二十七日亦已接运完毕。此次任务能很快完成，主要是因为任务本身切合群众需要，都愿以小麦棉花担保预换粗粮。其次是事前准备充分与计划周密，对任务的艰巨性认识明确，沿途配备医务人员、兽医，设开水站，派出警戒，调强有力的干部负责指挥带领等，因此发生问题较少。特别是原、延两县成绩最好，专署已通报号召其他各县向该两县学习。
