　　Adapting to the Needs of Northeast Economic Construction:
    240,000 New Workers Enter Production; Recruitment Plan Basically Completed
    [Shenyang News] Northeast Daily News: The Northeast worker recruitment plan for January to May of this year has been basically completed, with 240,000 new industrial soldiers surging onto the industrial production front.

    In order to adapt to the needs of Northeast's 1950 economic construction, the Northeast People's Government specially instructed the Labor Department, the Industry Department, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and other units to form the Northeast Worker Recruitment Committee in early March to carry out the recruitment of workers in an organized and planned manner. Under the unified leadership of the committee, provinces and cities also organized provincial and municipal worker recruitment committees and employment agencies. In addition, recruitment groups were also organized in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanghai. Over the past five months, according to incomplete statistics, the number of long-term workers has increased by 160,000 compared with the beginning of the year, and the number of seasonal construction workers has reached more than 80,000, completing the five-month recruitment plan.

    Although significant achievements have been made in recruitment work, there are still shortcomings. (1) The leadership of individual units is not thorough, and there is an irresponsible bureaucratic attitude and poor planning. In the case of the labor department, the recruitment of workers is only done by sending letters to the local area, asking for people based on the letters, and only arranging without investigation and research, resulting in passive work. In the case of industrial departments, such as Benxi Coal and Iron Company, 19,979 workers were hired from November last year to April this year, but because the consolidation of new workers was not done well, 6,955 workers left the factory, accounting for 35 percent of the workers hired. For example, Ansteel's construction plan was not well planned, and the supply of materials could not meet the demand, so thousands of workers had to do odd jobs. In addition, among the recruited construction workers, some workers were brought in by foremen, forming small groups; the foremen maintained feudal exploitation relationships, and even the layer-by-layer exploitation of large and small foremen still seriously existed. (2) Some cadres have not studied documents enough, and there is still departmentalism. For example, a county head said: "We have to repair dams. If too many people leave, it will have an impact. Let's not arrange for workers to return to work!" Some cadres even refused to let workers leave when they asked to return to work. These have seriously hindered the progress of the recruitment work.

    In response to the above problems, the Labor Department of the Northeast People's Government convened representatives of personnel work from ten units including the Ministry of Industry, the Railway Bureau, and Ansteel on the 5th and 6th of this month for detailed analysis and discussion, believing that in the future it is necessary to: (1) Strengthen the planning of worker recruitment. Strictly abide by the government's stipulated recruitment methods and promote the worker recruitment contract system. The number of people, types of work, time..., required by each enterprise should be reported to the local labor bureau in detail in advance. (2) Continue to mobilize technical workers scattered in rural areas to return to factories and mines. In order to supply the needs of economic construction for a long time, a long-term plan for training technical workers should be formulated at the same time as formulating production plans. (3) Special attention should be paid to the recruitment and management of construction workers, and the "foreman system" must be resolutely eliminated. (4) Attention should be paid to consolidating the work of workers and overcoming the current mobility of workers (such as Benxi). (5) Strengthen statistical work and the reporting system. It is stipulated that local agencies should report recruitment information to the labor bureau once a month to enhance management strength in order to meet the full supply of labor in the upsurge of economic construction.

　　适应东北经济建设需要
    廿四万新工投入生产  招工计划已基本完成
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：今年一月到五月的东北招聘工人计划，已基本完成，二十四万产业新军涌入工业生产战线。
    为适应东北一九五○年经济建设之需要，东北人民政府特责成劳动部、工业部、东北总工会等单位在三月初组成了东北招聘工人委员会，有组织有计划的进行招聘职工工作。在该会统一领导下，各省市亦组织了省市招聘工人委员会、职业介绍所，此外，还组织了河北、山东、上海三个地区的招聘团。五个月来，据不完全统计，比年初增加了长期工人十六万，季节性的修建工人达八万以上，完成了五个月的招聘计划。
    在招聘工作上虽然有了显著成绩，但还存在着缺点。（一）个别单位领导不深入，存在着不负责任的官僚主义态度，以及计划不周。表现在劳动部门的，是招聘工人只给地方去信算了事，凭信要人，只布置而不调查研究，形成工作被动。表现在产业部门的，如本溪煤铁公司，从去年十一月到今年四月采用职工一万九千九百七十九人，但由于对新工人的巩固工作做得不好，其中去后又离厂工人达六千九百五十五人，占采用工人百分之三十五。又如鞍钢由于修建计划不周，材料供不应求，数千工人就得作杂活。另外，在招聘的修建工人当中，有的工人是由把头接来的，搞小团体；包工头保持封建剥削关系，甚至大、小包工头的层层剥削，仍严重的存在着。（二）由于某些干部学习文件不够，还存在着本位主义思想。如某县长说：“咱们要修坝，人走多了有影响，动员工人回厂工作还是不布置吧！”甚而有的工人提出回厂要求，干部不让走。这些都严重的阻挠了招聘工作的进行。
    针对以上问题，东北人民政府劳动部曾召集工业部、铁路局、鞍钢等十个单位作人事工作的代表，于本月五、六日进行了详细分析、讨论，认为今后必须：（一）加强招聘工人的计划性。严格遵守政府规定的招工办法，推广招工合同制。各企业所用人数、工种、时间……，均应提前向当地劳动局详细报告。（二）继续动员流散在乡的技术工人回厂矿。为长期供应经济建设需要，应在制订生产计划同时，订出长期培养技术工人计划。（三）应特别注意修建工人的招聘和管理工作，坚决消灭“把头制”。（四）要注意巩固工人的工作，克服目前工人的流动性（如本溪）。（五）加强统计工作和报告制度。规定地方机关每月向劳动局汇报一次招聘情况，增强管理力量，以迎接经济建设高潮中劳动力的充分供应。
