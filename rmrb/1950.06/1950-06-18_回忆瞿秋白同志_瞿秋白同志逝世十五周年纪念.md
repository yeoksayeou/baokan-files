　　Remembering Comrade Qu Qiubai
    Commemorating the Fifteenth Anniversary of Comrade Qu Qiubai's Death
    Li Bozhao
    In 1931, Comrade Qu Qiubai was elected as the Minister of Education of the then People's Government by the First National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. In 1932, he came to Ruijin, the center of the Red Area, from the White Area. He suffered from severe lung disease, but his work was heavy, not only managing general cultural and educational work, but also concurrently managing the Art Bureau under the Ministry of Education, so he often worked while ill.

    At that time, the center of mass literary and artistic work in the Soviet Area was at the Red Army University. The Red Army University was successively headed by Comrades Ye Jianying and Liu Bocheng. They both attached great importance to the auxiliary role of literary and artistic work in education. The Workers' and Peasants' Drama Society, initiated and organized by a few literary and artistic enthusiasts from outside and senior cadres in the Red Army, was promoted to various provinces and counties in a short period of time, and even districts organized branches of the Workers' and Peasants' Drama Society. As the scope of work expanded, the need for literary and artistic cadres also increased, so the Central Soviet Area founded the first drama school. At that time, Comrade Qu Qiubai suggested that the name of the school should be named after Gorky. He said:
    "Gorky's literature and art are for the masses, and that should be the direction of our drama school!" He recommended Gorky's novel "Mother" and the play "The Lower Depths," saying:
    "Those are truly novels and dramas that express the working people."

    The establishment of a school without teachers, without textbooks, and without books was difficult and unimaginable. We found a dilapidated temple near Ruijin, slightly repaired it, and built an indoor theater. He used Lu Xun's words to encourage us: "Roads are made by walking." He also said, "The revolutionary drama school is still a newborn baby in the Soviet Area, nurture it slowly! Don't be impatient."

    More than 90% of the students were Communist Youth League members. They were all young men and women from rural areas who had participated in the land revolution and the Soviet struggle, some of whom were literate and some illiterate. The most difficult thing was the teachers, there were only a few, and most of them were part-time. Among them, Comrades Qian Zhuangfei and Hu Di taught the most classes, each teaching 24 hours a week. At that time, there were Kuomintang officers who were good at art and stage design, and some were good at directing. After a period of work and testing, the Party decided to invite them to be teachers. The students made excuses that they could not understand the Cantonese spoken by the captured officers and did not welcome them to teach. Comrade Qu Qiubai advised the students of the drama school:
    "If you can't understand Cantonese, you can listen slowly. At present, you need knowledge of art and knowledge of stage design. They have this kind of specialized knowledge, and you don't, so you must humbly learn from them. They used to be Kuomintang officers, surrendered their guns, and are now working for the Red Army. It's still wrong to hate them and look down on them. If you don't want them to teach you, you won't have teachers. If there are no teachers, the school will have to disband. If it disbands, you'll have to pack your bags and go home, and the school will close... You sing the Workers' and Peasants' Drama Society's song every day: 'We are revolutionary soldiers of the workers and peasants, art is our weapon, fighting for the Soviets!' I will ask you all a question, have you actually gotten the weapon of art in your hands?"

    The students answered neatly and decisively: "No!" The Communist Youth League members were convinced by Comrade Qu Qiubai.

    When discussing the teaching policy and plan of the Gorky Drama School, I remember that he emphasized two points: First, the school should have an affiliated theater troupe, organize tours to the front line to perform, encourage morale, and conduct combat mobilization. Usually, perform at markets on market days to maintain close contact with the masses and collect creative materials. He said, "You can never create popular art by working behind closed doors."

    Second, he advocated that the school should add Red Army classes and local classes in addition to ordinary classes. Cultural and entertainment work in the Red Army and the activities of the theater troupes of each army corps are an important part of political work. He believed that the drama school would lose its important significance if it did not train artistic cadres for the Red Army troops. At the same time, he suggested transferring the head of the Workers' and Peasants' Drama Society of Yunji District in Ruijin, the head of the Workers' and Peasants' Drama Society of Changting County, the head of the Workers' and Peasants' Drama Society of the Central Printing Factory, and the heads of each district to train them and open local classes, graduating in half a year. He said, "Without the backbone of drama work, there is no way to talk about the workers' and peasants' drama movement."

    After the Central Theater Troupe affiliated with the Drama School performed the play "Victory Must Be Achieved No Matter What," he convened a meeting of the authors, directors, and actors, praising the success of the play. This play was written between the fourth and fifth "Encirclement Campaigns," collecting materials from the Guangchang area about how the Kuomintang troops ravaged the people in the red and white border areas. A Young Pioneer member under the age of ten and his blind sister risked their lives to keep secrets, and never told the Red Army's itinerary until they died. Wherever this play was performed, the masses were moved to shout, "Kill the Kuomintang bandits!" Comrade Qiubai said:
    "This play should be performed everywhere in the border areas to resolve the most acute contradictions in the masses' struggle, expose the brutality of the Kuomintang troops, encourage the masses to fight against the Kuomintang troops, and increase the confidence of the masses in the border areas to win."

    At the same time, he also criticized the shortcomings of the script, emphasizing that some lines in the play seemed stiff, abstract, and unpleasant to the ear. He pointed out:
    "Use the words of living people to write lines, don't mechanically copy dead sentences from books. Be sure to make people understand as soon as they hear it, want to hear it, and like to hear it. Let the masses close their eyes and listen, and they can also hear what kind of person it is? Speaking in what kind of environment. The art of language is an indispensable condition for the success of drama."

    Comrade Qiubai encouraged everyone to collect folk songs to fill in the lyrics. At the celebration of the Second Soviet Congress, the club in Yunji District sang several songs that were very pleasant to listen to. Later, it was found out that they were the most popular "Bamboo Flute Song," "Chopping Wood Song," and "Ten Curses Against the Counter-Revolutionary Song" among the people of Jiangxi. He smiled and said to us:
    "Popular lyrics have a great educational effect on the masses. If no one writes the score, fill in the lyrics according to the folk song scores. They are pleasant to listen to, easy to sing, familiar to the masses, and can be spread immediately. They are better than some original tunes!"

    In order to prevent air raids, the school moved to Meicun, only two or three miles away from the Ministry of Education. Comrade Qiubai often came to give political lessons to the faculty and staff of the drama school and answer current affairs questions. Because he was proficient in Marxism-Leninism and could explain current affairs in a simple and easy-to-understand way, the audience was always full of energy and often burst into laughter. As soon as he walked out of the school gate, a large group of students and teachers surrounded him and would not let him leave. He always said:
    "I'll come back in a couple of days to listen to 'Aiyo Lai's' (Liu Xiuzhang's alias, she was the best young rural singer in Xingguo County) Xingguo folk songs."

    A burst of thunderous applause sent him away. The two youngest actors, Qiulan and Guo Dihai, always escorted him to the Ministry of Education before returning.

　　回忆瞿秋白同志
    瞿秋白同志逝世十五周年纪念
    李伯钊
    一九三一年，瞿秋白同志被第一次全国工农兵代表大会选为当时人民政府的教育部部长。一九三二年他由白色区域来到红色区域的中心瑞京。他患很重的肺病，但是工作繁重，不仅管一般的文化教育工作，还兼管教育部所隶属的艺术局，所以常常带病工作。
    苏区当时群众性的文艺工作中心在红军大学。红军大学先后由叶剑英同志和刘伯承同志任校长。他们都很重视文艺工作对教育工作所起的辅助作用。由外来的少数文艺工作的爱好者与红军中高级干部发动组织的工农剧社，很短期间就推广到各省县，以至于区都组织起工农剧社的分社。工作的范围扩大，文艺工作干部的需要也随着增加，中央苏区就创办了第一所戏剧学校。当时瞿秋白同志提议学校的名称应以高尔基来命名。他说：
    “高尔基的文艺是为大众的文艺，应该是我们戏剧学校的方向！”他推荐高尔基的小说《母亲》和戏剧《下层》说：
    “那真正是表现劳动人民的小说和戏剧。”
    没有教员，没有教材，没有书的学校创办是艰难的，难以想像的。我们在瑞京附近找着一所破庙，略加修理，建设了一个室内剧场。他用鲁迅的话来鼓励我们：“路是人走出来的。”他又说：“革命的戏剧学校在苏区还是初生的婴孩，慢慢抚育吧！不要性急。”
    学生百分之九十以上是共产青年团员。都是参加过土地革命苏维埃斗争的农村青年男女，有粗通文字的、也有文盲。最感困难的是教员，只有数的几个人，又多是兼职，内中钱壮飞同志、胡底同志的课最多，每周每人竟要担任二十四小时。当时俘虏来的白军军官中有擅长美术与舞台装置的，有长于导演的，经过一时期工作的考验，党就决定请他们当教员。学生借口听不懂俘虏军官的广东话，不欢迎他们讲课。瞿秋白同志劝告戏剧学校的同学们：
    “广东话听不懂可以慢慢听。目前你们需要美术的智识，舞台装置的智识。他们有这种专门智识，你们没有，要虚心跟他们学习。他们过去是白军军官，缴枪过来了，替红军做事了，仍然讨厌他们，瞧不起他们，这是不对的。你们不要他们教，你们就没有教员，没有教员的学校就只好散伙，散伙就只好请你们收拾包袱回家，学校关门……你们天天在唱工农剧社的社歌：“我们是工农革命的战士，艺术是我们的武器，为苏维埃而斗争！”我问你们大家一个问题，艺术这个武器你们究竟拿到手没有？”
    学生整齐而干脆的答道：“没有！”青年团员们被瞿秋白同志说服了。
    当着高尔基戏剧学校讨论教学方针计划的时候，我记得他强调了两点：第一，学校要附设戏团，组织到火线上去巡回表演，鼓励士气，进行作战鼓动。平时按集期到集上流动表演，保持同群众密切的联系，搜集创作材料。他说：“闭门造车是绝不能创造出大众化的艺术来的。”
    第二，他主张学校除普通班外应添设红军班和地方班。红军里面的文化娱乐工作与各军团剧社的活动是政治工作的重要部分。他认为戏剧学校如果不为红军部队培养艺术干部，就失掉了创办的重要意义。同时他建议把瑞京云集区工农剧社的社长，长汀县工农剧社社长，中央印刷厂工农剧社社长，各区的社长调来训练，开设地方班，半年毕业。他说：“没有戏剧工作骨干，就谈不到什么工农戏剧运动。”
    剧校所属中央剧团演出了《无论如何要胜利》一剧以后，他召开了作者、导演、演员的会议，称赞这个戏的成功。这出戏是在四次“围剿”和五次“围剿”之间，搜集了广昌一带白军如何蹂躏赤白交界的老百姓的材料写成的。一个不满十岁的儿童团员和他双目不明的姊姊用生命来保守秘密，至死不说出红军的行程。这个戏无论到那里演出，群众都被感动得高呼：“打死白匪！”秋白同志说：
    “这一出戏应当到边沿区到处去演，解决群众斗争最尖锐的矛盾，暴露白军的残暴，鼓励群众如何同白军作斗争，增加边沿区群众胜利的信心。”
    同时，他也批评剧本存在的缺点，着重指出该剧作中有的台词显得生硬，抽象，听起来不入耳。他指出：
    “要用活人口里的话来写台词，不要硬搬书上的死句子。务要使人一听就懂，愿意听，欢喜听。让群众闭上眼睛听，也能听出来是什么样的人？在什么样的环境下讲话。语言艺术是戏剧成功必不可少的条件。”
    秋白同志鼓励大家搜集民歌来填词。庆祝二苏大会上，云集区的俱乐部唱了几个歌子，很好听，后来打听出来都是江西老百姓中最流行的《竹片歌》、《砍柴歌》、《十骂反革命歌》。他笑着对我们说：
    “通俗的歌词对群众教育作用大，没有人写谱就照民歌典谱填词。好听，好唱，群众熟悉，马上能流传。比有些创作的曲子还好些！”
    为了防空，学校搬到梅村，离教育部只三二里路。秋白同志常来，为戏剧学校的教职员讲政治课，解答时事问题。由于他精通马列主义，能够深入浅出地讲解时事，听众总是精神饱满，常常发出笑声。他一走出校门，总有一大群学生和先生围住他，不让他走掉。他每次都说：
    “隔两天我再来听《哎哟来》（刘秀章的别名，她是兴国县最好的青年农妇歌手）的兴国山歌。”
    一阵如雷的掌声把他送走。两个最小的演员秋兰、郭滴海每次都把他送到教育部才回来。
