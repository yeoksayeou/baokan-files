　　On the Issue of Demolished and Sold Houses in Hug 각 Zhuang: Investigation and Handling Report from the Luan 남 County Government

Comrade Editor:

　　The article "Village Cadres in Hug 각 Zhuang Demolish and Sell People's Houses," published in the People's Garden on May 10th, was a very good criticism. We are now informing you of the results of our investigation and handling of the situation, and request that you publish it.

　　1. The article states: "Hug 각 Zhuang used to be a prosperous market town, but now it has become a sparsely populated, desolate and dilapidated village." This is a fact. The situation of house demolition in the village is as follows: In 1945, when the puppet Manchukuo army occupied the area, they demolished 60 houses to build barracks; villagers themselves demolished 13 houses. In 1947, during the land reform, villagers demolished 40 houses belonging to landlords and the "Huohui" (a kind of landlord armed force). In 1949, after a resolution by the mass meeting, 12 "Shaoguofang" houses (these were the village's fruits of victory, not distributed) were sold to buy vaccine injections for the masses. Villagers themselves demolished and sold 68 houses that had been distributed to them. Village cadres Yan Qing and Jin Shan demolished a total of five houses of their own (using the dismantled materials to repair other houses). From this, it can be seen that the statement "village cadres demolish and sell people's houses" is not factual.

　　2. Village Director (i.e., Village Head) Ma Shangwen, has few methods in his work, his approach is simple, and his speaking attitude is poor, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. For example, when military dependents ask him to solve problems, he sometimes argues with them, making them afraid to report problems to him.

　　3. Regarding the point that "district and village cadres are corrupt after liberation," this is something that happened in the past. The former village party secretary Ma Dianchen, and organization committee member Hao Junshan, were punished last year for embezzling public grain from the village and the government. The current cadres have no facts of corruption.

　　In summary, the reasons for the serious house demolition incident in the village are: (1) Because the county and district leaders turned a blind eye to this issue and failed to stop it in time. (2) Because the village had few people and many houses, and the land reform distributed them scattered, making it inconvenient for the masses to live in them, so they demolished the houses. (3) The village has suffered from floods for five consecutive years, making it extremely difficult for the masses to live, so they demolished and sold houses to maintain their lives. We have conducted three investigations on this issue. The masses have opinions on the current cadres, especially on Village Director Ma Shangwen, mainly saying that he uses coercion and commandism, and his attitude towards the masses is poor. Therefore, we have adopted a policy of reforming and educating the cadres, having Village Director Ma Shangwen publicly apologize to the masses, admit his mistakes, and guarantee that he will no longer use coercion and commandism in the future, and asking the masses to supervise him. The county and district governments also made self-criticisms at the mass meeting, so as to further unite the government and the masses, and the cadres and the masses, to do a good job.

### 关于胡各庄拆卖房屋问题  滦南县府报告调查处理经过

　　关于胡各庄拆卖房屋问题  滦南县府报告调查处理经过编辑同志：
    五月十日人民园地刊登了批评我县胡各庄“村干部拆卖群众房屋”一文。这个批评是很好的。现将我们调查处理的情况告诉你们，请予公布。
    一、文中说：“胡各庄过去是一个繁华的集镇，现在却成了个人烟绝少、荒凉破落的村庄了。”这是事实。该村拆房的情况是这样的：一九四五年，伪满军占据这里的时候，为了修兵营拆掉房子六十间；本村农民自己拆了十三间。一九四七年土地改革时，本村农民拆了地主和伙会（一种地主武装）的房子四十间。一九四九年，经过群众大会决议，把烧锅房十二间（这是本村胜利果实，未分配）卖掉，买了防疫苗给群众注射。农民自己将分得的房子拆卖了六十八间。村干部阎青、靳杉拆掉自己的房子共五间（将拆下的材料修理了别的房子）。由此看来，说“村干部拆卖群众房屋”不是事实。
    二、村主任（即村长）麻尚文，在工作上办法少，方式简单，说话态度不好，引起群众不满。譬如军属找他解决问题，他有时就和军属吵起来，使军属有问题也不敢向他反映。
    三、“解放后区村干部贪污腐化”一点，这是过去发生的事情。前任村支书麻殿臣，组织委员郝俊山二人，因贪污本村和政府的公粮，已在去年受到处分。现任干部没有贪污的事实。
    总之，该村造成严重的拆房子事件的原因是：（一）因为县、区领导上对此问题熟视无睹，未能及时予以制止。（二）该村人少房多，土地改革时分得零散，群众不便居住，因此将房拆了。（三）该村连续五年都发生水灾，群众生活异常困难，因此拆卖房屋维持生活。对此问题，我们前后曾进行了三次调查。群众对现任干部，特别是对村主任麻尚文有意见，主要是说他强迫命令，对待群众态度不好等等。因此，我们对于干部采取了改造教育的方针，让村主任麻尚文群众公开道歉，承认错误，保证今后不再强迫命令，并要求群众监督。县、区政府也在群众会上作了自我检讨，以便由此达到政府与群众、干部与群众的进一步团结，把工作做好。
