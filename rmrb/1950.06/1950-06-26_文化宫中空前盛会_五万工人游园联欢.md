　　Unprecedented Grand Gathering in the Palace of Culture
　　Five Thousand Workers Participate in Garden Party and Get-Together
　　[Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal Workers' Garden Party and Get-Together was held yesterday (the 25th) at the Laboring People's Cultural Palace. More than 50,000 participating workers spent the day happily with extremely warm hearts.
　　The conference began with reports from labor heroes Liu Yingyuan and Zhao Guoyou. Liu Yingyuan's report, "Do a Good Job in Production and Create New Records," and Zhao Guoyou's report, "How I Created New Records" and "Impressions of Visiting the Soviet Union," received continuous and warm applause from the workers. Shouts of "We must do a good job in production and improve technology," "Learn from the two labor heroes!" and "Learn from their production experience and create new records" rose one after another.
　　When the cultural and recreational activities began, the first event was a neat and majestic waist drum team of 400 workers parading and performing in the park. Subsequently, various literary, artistic, and sports activities also took place.
　　Among the cultural programs, the military music "We Workers Have Strength," the grand chorus of "Building the Motherland" and "Ode to the Communist Party," and the new folk art performances "New Five Saints Paying Homage to Heaven," "Ten Daughters Praising Their Husbands," and "Examining the Witch" were the most popular among the workers. In the sports activities, workers felt a strong interest in the relay cross-country race, tug-of-war, and various group games and dances.
　　Major bookstores and publishing houses in Beijing set up cultural service stations and cultural supply stations in the park. Many workers surrounded the stands to buy and read books. The supply stations sold more than 1,000 books, among which "The Constitution of the Communist Party of China" and "One Hundred Questions on the Labor Movement" sold the most.
　　In addition, the Municipal People's Broadcasting Station set up a broadcasting station in the park, broadcasting many recordings of workers' own cultural and artistic programs. The New Folk Art Experimental Activity Group of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Folk Art Improvement Association also rushed to the venue to perform many programs, adding a lot to the conference.
　　In the evening, more than 7,000 workers watched the films "The People's New Lushun-Dalian" and "Little Hero". The conference ended at 11 p.m.
