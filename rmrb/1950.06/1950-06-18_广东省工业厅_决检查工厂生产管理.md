　　Guangdong Provincial Department of Industry
    Decides to Inspect Factory Production Management

    [Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] The Guangdong Provincial People's Government Department of Industry has decided to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the production management of its affiliated factories in June and July. At present, the phenomenon of waste and damage to state property due to poor management in some state-owned factories under the Guangdong Provincial People's Government Department of Industry is quite serious. For example, at the No. 1 Branch of the Iron and Steel Machinery Factory, from the end of December last year to the end of April this year, due to engineering personnel's disregard for workers' suggestions, five furnaces of steel were not produced, and nearly half of the steel in nine furnaces was lost, resulting in a total loss of more than 180 million yuan. The factory leaders neither seriously inspected and corrected this, nor did they report it to higher authorities in a timely manner. At the Guangdong Textile Factory, due to negligence in inspection, the front part of the high-speed gear of a 500-kilowatt turbine generator suddenly broke in mid-April, causing serious losses. Afterwards, the factory did not investigate the cause of the accident. To this end, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government has formed an inspection committee to investigate the above-mentioned incidents in the two factories and decided to conduct a general inspection in the affiliated factories and mines.

　　广东省工业厅
    决检查工厂生产管理
    【新华社广州十五日电】广东省人民政府工业厅决定在六、七两月全面检查所属工厂的生产管理工作。目前广东省人民政府工业厅所属部分公营工厂因管理不力而浪费损毁国家资财的现象相当严重。如钢铁机械厂第一分厂炼铸场自去年十二月底至今年四月底，由于工程人员的不重视工人建议，五炉钢没有炼成，九炉钢损失几达半数。损失共约一亿八千多万元。该厂领导人员对此既不认真检查、纠正，也没有及时报告上级。广东纺织厂由于疏于检查，五百千瓦透平发电机高速齿轮前部于四月中突然断裂，造成了严重的损失。事后，该厂亦未调查事故原因。为此，广东省人民政府已组成检查委员会，对该两厂上述事件进行调查，并决定在所属厂矿中普遍进行检查。
