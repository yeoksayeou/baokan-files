　　Hegang Workers Are Living Happily
    Liu Tieci
    After visiting the single workers' dormitory in Dongshan, Hegang, a responsible comrade from the Northeast Coal Mine Management Bureau excitedly said, "You are living a socialist life!"
    This is not an exaggeration. The lives of workers in many places, especially single workers, are indeed superior. In the past four years, the workers have personally experienced how the wealth they produce has improved their lives. Everyone can clearly remember how the "four-season pants," "flowering coats," and "burlap sacks," moldy rice, chaff, and dirty workers' quarters of the enemy and puppet period have been transformed into the current buildings, new clothes, and cafeterias... This dream-like, enormous transformation in such a short period of time often leads workers to ask naively, "If we live such a good life under the New Democracy, how will we live under Socialism?!"
    Let's take the Dongshan Building, which was recently made into a documentary by the Beijing Film Studio under the title "Workers' Home," as an example:
    The building was completed in December 1949 and houses nearly nine hundred single workers, who live in rooms accommodating a dozen to twenty people. Whenever the workers get up (regardless of whether it's the first, second, or third shift), the dormitory attendant has already prepared what they need. After washing up, they take their meal tickets to the cafeteria. Whether it's day or night, if you want ordinary meals, you go to the first cafeteria; if you want white rice and fried fish, you go to the second cafeteria; if you want noodles and any stir-fried, steamed, or fried dishes, or want a couple of drinks, you go to the third cafeteria. The cups, plates, tables, and chairs are much cleaner than those in ordinary restaurants, and the prices are also cheaper. The male and female comrades in charge of taking care of the meals are so sincere and enthusiastic. After eating, they return to the dormitory, where the dormitory attendant has already prepared boiling water. When the time comes, everyone sets off together for "collective work." After getting off work, everyone jumps into the bathhouse, takes a good bath, changes into comfortable clothes, and returns to the dormitory. The dormitory attendant has already made the beds neatly, smoothing out the sheets and blankets; the tables, chairs, and floors, and glass are wiped clean; boiling water is also prepared. Those who like musical instruments sit by the warm window and play; some even bought their own phonographs. Those who want to perform go to the club. There, the mining bureau's cultural troupe often helps the workers' amateur drama troupe rehearse plays and sing. The library is always crowded with people, and there are hundreds of books, journals, and newspapers. On clear days, the ball fields are rarely idle; there are always people playing ball intensely. Many also like to play cards, chess, etc. in the recreation room. On the green grassy slopes, people often lie down and sing loudly and heartily. Large wall newspapers and blackboards often attract some people, with the production achievements of each pit, team, and group, the deeds of individual model heroes, and the works of workers full of joy, enthusiasm, and revolutionary heroism. The most boiling day is Saturday evening, and the gorgeously decorated club is filled with people early on. Most are workers and staff, as well as their families. A thousand freely foldable easy chairs can be sat on for several hours without feeling tired. Sometimes movies are shown on the stage, sometimes the cultural troupe performs plays, and sometimes the workers' amateur drama troupe performs. The programs are all closely related to the workers' lives and production. But even more fascinating is the dance party. With the help of the cultural troupe, many workers have learned to dance. In the light music, they dance happily. The workers have no worries; if they unfortunately get sick, they don't have to spend any money on medicine, and proper treatment will quickly restore them to health. Those suffering from long-term illnesses are transferred to the mainland sanatorium in the suburbs for long-term recuperation. The old and homeless go to nursing homes.
    The Dongshan Building is just a corner of the life of Hegang workers.
    The newly built Western-style family residences are in Dongshan and Nanshan. Xingshan and Xishan are where the Japanese residences of the puppet Manchukuo were repaired. On both sides of the stone and asphalt streets, the light gray and red Western-style houses are hidden among the lush weeping willows, which are very beautiful and comfortable. Half-price movies, free bathhouses, ball fields, and dances can also be taken to the family. The department store with all kinds of goods is located in the center of the family residence.
    Regular spare-time schools have long been established, and more than 3,400 workers and staff are studying culture hard. Everyone knows: "To manage the country and master technology, it is impossible without culture!"
    With the improvement of technology and the implementation of mechanized coal mining methods, production efficiency has been continuously improved, so the income of workers has been continuously increased, and their lives have been continuously improved. New residences and schools are being built, and New Antai is planning to excavate new wells and build new cities. Now they are using Saturday half-day voluntary labor time to build a garden.

　　鹤岗工人在愉快地生活着
    刘铁慈
    东北煤矿管理总局一位负责同志来鹤岗参观了东山工人独身宿舍以后，兴奋地说：“你们过社会主义生活了！”
    这话并不夸张。许多地方的工友们，特别是独身工友们的生活，确是优越的。在四年多中间，工友们亲身体验到：自己生产的财富怎样改善了自己的生活。每人都能清楚的记得从敌伪时期的“四季裤”、“开花袄”、“麻袋片”、霉米、糟糠、肮脏的工舍怎样变成了现在的大楼、新衣、食堂……。在这短时间内梦一般的巨大转变，也常常引起工友们天真的发问：“新民主主义就过这样好的生活，社会主义时将怎样过法呢？！”
    拿最近由北京电影制片厂，以“工人之家”为题，摄成记录片的东山大楼做例子吧：
    大楼是一九四九年十二月落成的，里面住着近九百名独身工友，分住在可容十几至二十几人的房间里。工友们随时起了床（不管是一班二班三班），宿舍员早已把需要的东西准备好了。洗漱完毕，拿起饭票到食堂去，不论日夜，如果你要吃普通饭菜，就到第一食堂；想吃白饭煎鱼之类，就到第二食堂；如果想吃面饭和随意要些熘炒蒸炸各种菜，或想喝两杯酒就到第三食堂。杯盘桌椅比一般街上的饭馆要洁净得多，价钱也便宜。负责照顾吃饭的男女同志，都是那样诚恳热心。吃完饭回到宿舍里，宿舍员早已准备好了开水。时间到了，大家一齐出发“集体上班”。下班回来，大家先跳进澡塘里，痛痛快快洗个澡，换上轻松的衣服，回到宿舍。宿舍员早把被褥铺得整整齐齐，被单、毯子，按得平平乎乎；桌椅、地板、玻璃，擦得干干净净；开水也准备好了。喜欢乐器的人，就坐在温暖的窗前玩乐器；还有的人自己买了留声机。愿意演剧的，就到俱乐部去。那里经常有矿务局文工团帮助工人业余剧团排剧，唱歌。图书馆总是挤满了人，那里有几百种书籍、刊物和报纸。晴朗天气，球场很少有闲着的时候，总是有人激烈的在赛球。也有许多人喜欢在游艺室打扑克、下橡棋等。绿草如茵的山坡，也常有些人在那里躺着，大声尽情的歌唱。大幅的墙报和黑板报前面，常常吸引住一些人，上面是各坑各班各组的生产成绩、个人英模事迹，还有充满了欢喜与热情、革命的雄英气概的工友著作。沸腾的日子，是星期六晚间，装璜华丽的俱乐部老早就坐满了人。多数是工友职员，也有他们的家属，一千张自由张合式安乐椅连着坐几个钟头也不感到疲累。台上有时演电影，有时由文工团演剧，也有时由工人业余剧团出演。节目都是与工人生活、生产有密切联系的。但比这更引人入胜的是跳舞晚会，工友们在文工团帮助下很多人都学会了跳舞。在轻快的音乐声里，愉快的舞着。工人们没有一丝顾虑，万一不幸生病了，医药一切都不必花钱，适当的医治很快就会使人恢复健康。患长期疾病的，就被转到郊外大陆疗养所长期休养。老而无家的，进养老院。
    东山大楼不过是鹤岗工人生活的一角。
    新建起来的洋式的家族住宅，在东山、南山都有。兴山、西山是把伪满日本人住宅重新修补起来的。石头的和沥青的街道两旁，葱绿的垂杨间，掩映着浅灰色的和红色的洋房，很好看也很舒适。半价的电影，不花钱的澡塘，球场和跳舞会，还可以带家族去。百货俱全的百货公司，就在家族住宅的中心。
    正规业余学校早就成立了，三千四百余名工友及职员，正在紧张学习文化。大家都知道：“要管理国家、掌握技术，没有文化是不行的！”
    随着技术改进，实行机械化采煤法，生产能率不断提高，因之工人收入不断增加，生活也不断提高。新的住宅、学校不断建立起来，新安台方面正在计划开凿新井，和建立新都市。现在正用星期六半日义务劳动时间，修筑一处花园。
