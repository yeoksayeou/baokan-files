Xinhua News Agency, Inner Mongolia, 13th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government is vigorously promoting new farm tools to improve agricultural production. In November of last year, the Inner Mongolia People's Government Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry ordered 300 improved plows and harrows and 4,500 cultivator-ridgers from the Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department and the Harbin Farm Tool Factory. It also ordered more than 1,000 weeder-hilling plows and "Songnong" brand cultivator-ridgers from the Wulanhot People's Iron Factory, the Farm Tool Factory, and other places, totaling more than 6,100 units. These were loaned to farmers in various regions for trial use in April and May of this year. At the same time, as early as January of this year, the Autonomous Region People's Government distributed 146 harvesters, mowers, and other machines purchased from the Soviet Union to the Xing'an, Jerim, Hulun, and Zhaowuda leagues and the Nawen Farm and Ranch for trial use. Thanks to the government's vigorous promotion and the active publicity and promotion by labor models and cadres, new farm tools have been welcomed by the broad masses. Farmers not only like to use new farm tools, but also enthusiastically study them during the trial use process and offer suggestions for improvement.

    农民喜欢使用并提出改进意见
    【新华社内蒙十三日电】内蒙自治区人民政府大力推广新式农具，以提高农业生产。去年十一月间，内蒙人民政府农牧部向东北农林部和哈尔滨市农具工厂订购改良耲耙三百台、铲趟机四千五百台，并在乌兰浩特市人民铁工厂、农具工厂等处订购铲草培土犁和松农号铲趟机一千余台，总共六千一百余台，于今年四、五月中分别贷给各地农民试用。同时，自治区人民政府早在今年一月间即将从苏联买来的收割机、割草机等共一百四十六台，发给兴安、哲里木、呼纳、昭乌达四个盟区和纳文农场、牧场试用。由于政府大力提倡和劳动模范、干部积极宣传推广，新农具已为广大群众所欢迎。农民不仅喜欢使用新农具，并能在试用过程中热心研究，提出改进意见。
