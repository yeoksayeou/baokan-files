How to Understand the Issue of Joint Operations
    Zhang Yuexia

    I. The Current Situation of Joint Operations

    The great victory of the Chinese revolution and the steady advancement of the New Democratic economy have placed Chinese society as a whole in a major transformation. Private industrial and commercial enterprises have encountered difficulties of varying degrees in this historical transformation. In order to overcome these difficulties, many places have already organized various joint operations under the guidance of the government; some regions are in the process of酝酿 and promoting them. There are also different views and evaluations of the nature and role of joint operations from all sides.

    Now, let's first introduce the situation of joint operations in several cities:

    First, the regions and industries involved in joint operations: The regions involved in joint operations include cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Shenyang, and the Southern Jiangsu Area; the industries participating in joint operations include more than 30 industries such as sausage casing processing, soap making, knitting, weaving and dyeing, cigarette making, brick and tile making, carpet making, sheet metal, refining and dyeing, toothbrush making, papermaking, sauce making, new medicine, shoemaking, soda water, construction, leather making, transportation, canvas, silk weaving, pencil making, shirt making, sewing machine manufacturing, wool spinning machinery, iron industry, silk weaving, matches, flour, cotton spinning, and cloth industry joint operations.

    Second, the number of participating enterprises: According to preliminary investigations, Shanghai has 320 enterprises in eight industries such as wool spinning and silk weaving; Tianjin has 389 enterprises in nine industries such as brick and tile and carpet making; Hangzhou has 469 enterprises in five industries such as weaving, dyeing, and cloth factories; Shenyang has 1,116 enterprises in three industries such as machinery and ironwork.

    Third, the types of joint operations: The types of joint operations can be roughly divided into the following categories: (1) Joint procurement. Its purpose is relatively simple, only to raise funds to purchase raw materials, and distribute the purchased raw materials according to the proportion of capital contributed. For example, the joint cotton purchasing office led by public and private yarn factories in Shanghai has purchased raw cotton in two phases. The cotton industry in Tianjin raises funds to jointly purchase waste cotton for弹轧废棉; the oil mill industry raises funds to jointly purchase flax seeds. The pencil industry in Shanghai jointly purchases wood, and so on, all of which have achieved considerable results.

    (2) Sales joint operations: Mainly through collective agreements, evaluate product prices, and mutually help solve difficulties in sales, eliminating excessive intermediary exploitation. For example, matches in Qingdao are sold to the Northwest while grain is transported back; flour in Shanghai, weaving and dyeing, papermaking, and scale making in Tianjin, and knitting industry in Beijing all adopt joint sales.

    (3) Production and sales joint operations: The content is more complex, and the participating industries and organizational forms are also more numerous. It not only needs to standardize prices, but also plans production and uniformly adjusts machinery and technology. One type is to allocate production according to the capacity of each factory based on the orders received. Such as the textile supplies and shirt industries in Shanghai. Another type is to allocate production according to possible actual sales. Such as the cigarette and silk weaving industries in Shanghai, and the silk weaving industry in Hangzhou. This joint operation has more complex content, and therefore requires more effort than the previous two types. The organizational forms include the establishment of joint operation offices and joint operation limited companies.

    (4) Unified acceptance and handling of joint operations: This is mainly for industrial product processing or undertaking public orders. The purpose is also simpler, just to use the overall organization to accept orders, and then distribute them to processing factories according to proportion. Public and private parties sign contracts to determine unified delivery dates and standardize specifications and quality. Such as the brick and tile industry in Tianjin, and the towel, blanket, bleaching and dyeing, refining and dyeing, shipping, and construction industries in Shanghai.

    (5) Temporary joint operations: This is mainly a joint operation implemented by a few factories to undertake large batches of orders from the state and institutions. For example, Hangzhou organized weaving groups to jointly size and weave cloth for the public, the Shenyang textile industry jointly operated for a certain processing for the public; the Tianjin hardware smelting industry undertook parts for the Railway Bureau, and the wooden boat industry undertook the wooden boats ordered by Pingyuan Province. Once a batch of orders is completed, the joint operation ends.

    II. The Role of Joint Operations

    First, there should be a clear understanding of the role of joint operations. Because Chinese private enterprises have always had many weaknesses. For example, reliance on foreign countries, most are small and medium-sized industries, insufficient capital, decentralized management, backward technology, and blind production. These conditions make the strength of Chinese private enterprises very weak, and there is an objective need for joint operations. At present, some local governments are promoting joint operations; some private enterprises hope to organize joint operations to overcome difficulties, which is good. Organizing small and medium-sized industries can not only jointly overcome difficulties at present, but also transform private enterprises, making them move towards organized and planned production. Because overcoming the difficulties left over from the old society contains the meaning of innovation, and this innovation needs to be completed by the collective strength of the same industry.

    Second, whether in production, sales, or raw material procurement, small and medium-sized private enterprises can increase production power by implementing joint operations. For example, the capital of the cotton spinning industry in Wuxi City, Southern Jiangsu, increased from 200 yarn spindles to 812 yarn spindles after the joint operation; the cotton spinning industry in Suzhou increased from 95 yarn spindles to 185 yarn spindles, and plans to increase to 1,000 yarn spindles, all of which solved some difficulties in capital turnover at that time. For example, the Zhendan Silk Factory in Hangzhou received an order for 17,000 yards from Wing Tai Trading Company in Hong Kong in December, but it could not be completed due to insufficient funds; only after the joint operation did it have the power to produce export orders. Not only that, joint operations can also expand credit and facilitate the struggle against dominant foreign merchants. Such as the situation in the cigarette industry in Shanghai. On the other hand, it also facilitates obtaining loans from private banks.

    Third, joint purchase or joint sales can avoid excessive exploitation by intermediate merchants caused by small-scale decentralized operations, can save unnecessary and overlapping expenses of transportation, storage, management, and personnel, reduce the production cost per unit; and can also avoid unnecessary losses such as mutually raising prices when each factory purchases or sells separately. For example, many manufacturers in Nantong area, Southern Jiangsu, raised prices last year when purchasing cotton, but this problem was overcome after the joint operation. For example, the match industry in Jinan and Qingdao used to have difficulties in negotiating train wagons for one factory, and it was also a waste. After adopting joint sales, the transportation difficulties were solved.

    Fourth, the production and sales combined mode can streamline personnel, save expenses, and reduce costs. The examples of the brick and tile industry in Tianjin and the soap production and sales cooperative in Beijing can illustrate this point. When the soap industry was not in a joint operation, the total working capital converted into soap was 850 boxes, which was not enough; after the joint operation, only 650 boxes were enough to pay. In terms of personnel, the four factories had 34 employees before the joint operation. The monthly salary, food expenses, and business expenses totaled 10,285 catties of millet. After the joint operation, the number of employees was reduced to 16 (mainly reducing the managers and staff with high salaries). The monthly salary, food expenses, and business expenses were reduced to 4,299 catties of millet, which was 5,786 catties of millet less than before the joint operation. In addition, sales were expanded, and the monthly output increased from 700 boxes to 803 boxes, while the cost per box was also reduced by 9.34 catties of millet.

    III. The Shortcomings of Joint Operations

    First, the joint operations of private enterprises are still capitalist organizations. Due to the long-term abnormal development of the Chinese business community, serious improper practices have arisen. Such as monopoly speculation, mutual infighting, and evasion of taxes, which are not easy to eliminate in a short time. Therefore, the organization of joint operations is not easy to improve in a short time and requires great efforts.

    Second, joint operations sometimes need to achieve consistency in technology. However, due to the narrow-mindedness and selfishness of some capitalists, factories with high technology are unwilling to disclose and help each other. Some capitalists participate in joint operations when they encounter difficulties, but when the situation improves, they want to break up and still want to adopt blind competition methods.

    Third, it is easy to generate dependence. After the joint operation, unified material purchase and unified sales make some factories generate dependence, and they are not concerned or active in the public affairs of the joint operation, only wanting to sit back and enjoy the success, or only wanting public loans, orders, and processing assistance.

    Fourth, there have been egalitarian tendencies in some places. Some manufacturers participate in joint operations for loans and credit, which instead affects the role of their capital. Because after the loan is obtained, it is distributed equally according to the size of the factory. This is beneficial to small and medium-sized factories, but it causes a side effect of restricting investment for large factories with more abundant funds, wasting capital. Conversely, factories with weaker capital need more loans, but actually get very little.

    In summary: The joint operation method has advantages and disadvantages, but the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Joint operation is a more progressive operating method for private enterprises at present. It can organize decentralized enterprises, facilitate mutual assistance and mutual observation, save manpower, material resources, and financial resources, reduce expenses, improve credibility, and also facilitate accepting large-scale processing and orders from the state, with uniform specifications and consistent quality. At the same time, it facilitates the state to guide decentralized private enterprises, and provide loans and acquisitions under possible conditions. Moreover, it can adjust the phenomena of blind competition and mutual exclusion. These have been proven by the joint operation experiences in various places. As for all the above shortcomings, as long as the public pays attention to leadership and the private business community makes its own efforts, they can be gradually overcome.

    IV. The Leadership Issue of Joint Operations

    As mentioned above, joint operations must have the leadership of the state-owned economy. Joint operations are better in regions and cities where the leadership is more effective. Most of the joint operation organizations and methods have been promoted, supported, and guided by the local government. The following principles must be paid attention to in the leadership:

    First, before the joint operation, we should attach importance to whether the conditions are ripe, conduct prior醞釀, and conduct investigations and studies. We must fully prevent acute diseases or blind joint operations to avoid disputes after the joint operation.

    Second, we should help as much as possible in the direction of production, pointing out which industries have prospects and which regions have sales channels. We must prevent unnecessary blind competition between joint operation organizations.

    Third, pay attention to mutual unity in joint operations, negotiate affairs, and reduce disputes. Adopt appropriate methods, strengthen ideological education, and correct possible problems.

    Fourth, the experience of various places has proven that the guiding methods for joint operations should be applied specifically and flexibly under a unified policy, according to different actual conditions. For example:

    (1) Guiding joint operations through processing and ordering. This is very effective. For example, Tianjin's leadership of the brick and tile industry joint operation and the sheet metal industry joint operation were promoted through processing and ordering, while helping them solve the difficulties of grain and coal at that time.

    (2) Under possible conditions, the public participates in joint operations. Such as joint loans from public and private banks, the joint cotton purchasing office of public and private factories in Shanghai, and the Southern Jiangsu Cotton Spinning Joint Operation Office, in which state-owned trading companies participated with part of the funds, and the government played a role in promoting and guiding. However, the government does not have to directly participate in every industry, because there are actually many difficulties in this regard.

    (3) Promoting joint operations through trade associations, and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce directly taking responsibility to help and lead the joint operation organization when necessary, have a great effect.

    V. Important Conditions for Doing a Good Job in Joint Operations

    First, we must truly grasp the raw materials and sales channels and seek a balance between production and sales in order to last. Therefore, after the joint operation of various industries, we should try every means to face the vast rural market in China, take farmers and the broad working people in cities as the main sales targets, and produce more of what they need. At the same time, we should adopt various methods to strive for the export market. In addition, accept state processing orders and use consignment sales and other methods to ensure sales and profits. For industries with considerable overproduction at present, such as the cigarette industry, the soap industry, and matches, the joint operation must formulate a production and sales plan to achieve a balance between production and sales; otherwise, the sales problem will not be solved, and disputes will occur when the joint operation is established, which will be difficult to maintain.

    Second, participation in joint operations should be based on the principle of voluntariness, and no coercion of any degree or in any way should be applied. If there is no understanding of joint operations in ideology, reluctantly participating in joint operations will increase the trouble within the joint operation. For example, in the joint operation of the Beijing Mass Socks Factory, one of them lacked a fundamental understanding of joint operations and participated a bit out of politeness. It still withdrew from the joint operation halfway, while the other four, because they were willing, have persisted to this day.

    Third, a thorough investigation should be conducted in advance on the situation of each factory preparing to participate in the joint operation, and there should be full醞釀, formulate agreements, negotiate articles of association and detailed rules, and elect prestigious and impartial activists to take on the work of the joint operation leadership organization. Reward progressive technologies and work attitudes, advocate ordering production plans, pay attention to quality and specifications, evaluate prices, etc.

    In short, in order to do a good job in joint operations, on the one hand, there must be correct guidance from the government, and on the other hand, efforts are also needed from the joint operation enterprises themselves.

　　怎样认识联营问题
    张月霞
    一、联营的现况
    中国革命的伟大胜利，新民主主义经济的稳步前进，使整个中国社会正处在一个大转变中。私营工商业在这一历史转变中，遇到了程度不同的困难。它们为着克服困难，很多地方已经在政府的指导下，分别组织了各种联营；有的地区，则正在酝酿推进中。对于联营的本质和作用，各方面也有不同的看法和估价。
    现在先把几个城市的联营情况，介绍如下：
    第一，联营地区与行业：联营地区，计有北京、天津、上海、杭州、济南、青岛、沈阳、苏南区等城市；参加联营的行业，计有肠衣整理、造胰、针织、织染、卷烟、砖瓦、地毯、白铁、炼染、牙刷、造纸、酱料、新药、制鞋、汽水、营造、制革、运输、帆布、丝织、铅笔、衬衫、缝纫机制造、毛纺机器、铁工业、织绸、火柴、面粉、棉纺、及布业联营等三十余行业。
    第二，参加联营的家数，据初步调查，上海为毛纺丝织等八个行业，共计三百二十家；天津为砖瓦地毯等九个行业，共计三百八十九家；杭州为织染布厂等五个行业，共计四百六十九家；沈阳为机器铁工等三个行业，共计一千一百十六家。
    第三，联营的类别：联营类别，大体可分为下列几种：（一）联合采购。它的目的比较简单，仅是为着集资采购原料，将购买来的原料，按所出资金比例分配之。如上海由公私营纱厂联合购棉处，领导采购原棉，已办了二期。天津的棉花业为弹轧废棉，集资采购废棉；油坊业集资联购麻子。上海铅笔业联购木料等，都收了相当的效果。
    （二）推销联营：主要是通过集体协议，评定产品价格，互助解决推销上的困难，免去过份的中间剥削。如青岛之火柴，销往西北，同时运回粮食；上海的面粉，天津的织染、造纸、制秤，北京的针织业等，都采取联合推销。
    （三）产销联营：内容比较复杂，参加的行业及组织形式也比较多。它不仅要划一价格，而且也要计划生产，统一调整机器和技术。其中有一种是把承接的定货，按各厂能力，定出比例，分配生产。如上海的纺织用品，衬衣等业。另一种是按照可能的实销情况，分配生产。如上海的卷烟，丝织，杭州的织绸等业。此项联营内容比较复杂，因而比前述二种费力要大一些，组织方式，有的是成立联营处，有的是联营股份有限公司。
    （四）统接统办联营：这主要是为工业品加工或承受公家定货，目的也较单纯，只是利用整体的组织，去承接定货，再按比例分配给加工的厂家，公私双方签定合同，确定统一交货日期，划一规格质量。如天津的砖瓦业，上海的毛巾、被毯、漂印、炼染、航运、营造等业。
    （五）临时性的联营：这主要是少数工厂为承制国家和机关的大批定货而实行联营。如杭州组织了织布小组，共同替公家浆纱织布，沈阳纺织业为公家某种加工而联营；天津的五金冶制业为了替铁路局承制零件，木车船业为了承制平原省所订购的木船等。一批定货完毕，联营即行结束。
    二、联营的作用
    第一，对于联营的作用问题，应有明确的认识。因为中国私营企业历来存在着许多弱点。例如依赖外国，中小型工业占多数，资金不足，经营分散，技术落后，盲目生产等。这些条件，使中国私营企业本身的力量甚为软弱，客观上有联营的需要。目前有些地方政府，推动联营；有些私营企业，希望组织联营，来克服困难，这是好的。将中小工业组织起来，这不仅在目前可以共同克服困难，同时也可改造私营企业，使它走向有组织有计划的生产。因为克服旧社会遗留下来的困难，就含有革新的意义，而这个革新是需要用同行同业本身的集体力量去完成的。
    第二，不论在生产上、贩售上、或原料收购上，中小的私营企业实行联合经营是可以增加生产的力量。如苏南无锡市的棉纺业的资金，联营后由二百件纱增到八百十二件纱；苏州的棉纺业，由九十五件纱增到一百八十五件纱，并拟增到一千件纱，都解决了当时资金周转上的一些困难。再如杭州的震旦绸厂，十二月间就接受了香港永泰商行一万七千码的定货，因资金不足，不能完成；联营后才有力量生产外销定货。不仅如此，联营又能扩大信用，便于与占优势的外商作斗争。如上海的卷烟业的情形，就是如此。另一方面，也便于向私营银行进行贷款。
    第三，联购或联销，可以避免由于小规模分散经营而引起过份的中间商人剥削，能够撙节不必要的、重叠的运输、保管、管理等机构和人员的费用，减低每单位的生产成本；也能避免各厂单独采购或推销时，互抬价格等不必要的损失。如去年苏南南通一带收购棉花，很多厂商你争我抬，提高物价，联营后克服了这一弊病。又如济南、青岛的火柴业，以前一个工厂交涉火车皮有困难，同时也是浪费，采用联销后，解决了运输上的困难。
    第四，产销联合的方式，可以精简人员，节省开支，降低成本。如天津的砖瓦业，北京的肥皂产销联营社等的例子，就可以说明这点。当肥皂业在联营前，共有流动资金折合肥皂八百五十箱，还不够用；联营后只要六百五十箱，即够支付了。而人员方面呢，联营前四个厂有职工三十四人，每月薪金伙食费用加营业费用，共需小米一万○二百八十五斤；联营后职工人数减为十六人（主要减少了支大薪的经理和职员），每月薪金伙食及营业费用等等开支，降低至小米四千二百九十九斤，比联营前减少了五七八六斤小米。再加上销路有开展，每月产量由七○○箱增加到八○三箱，而每箱成本也减少了九·三四斤小米。
    三、联营的缺点
    第一，私营企业的联营还是资本主义性质的组织，由于中国企业界在长期不正常的发展中，产生了严重的不正派的作风。如垄断投机，互相倾轧，逃避税收等，不易一时消灭。因此，联营的组织，一时不易健全，需要作很大的努力。
    第二，联营在技术上，有时需取得一致。但是，由于有些资本家的狭窄短视和自私，技术高的厂家，就不愿公开，不愿互助。有的资本家遇困难时，就参加联营，一到情况好转，就要散伙，仍想采用盲目竞争的办法。
    第三，容易产生依赖性。联营后统一购料，统一销售，使一些工厂产生依赖思想，对联营的公共事情，不关心，不积极，光想坐享其成，或光想公家贷款、定货、加工等帮助。
    第四，有些地方发生了平均主义的偏向。有的厂家为了贷款，为了信誉而参加联营，反而影响了它的资力的作用。因为贷到款后，按工厂大中小比例，平均分配。这对中小厂来说是有利的，对大厂资金比较雄厚者，则引起限制其投资的副作用，浪费了资金。反过来，资金较弱的厂家，需要贷款多，而实际得到的很少。
    总起来看：联营方式存在着优缺点，但是，优点是多于缺点的。联合经营在目前是私营企业一种较进步的经营方式，能将分散的企业组织起来，便于互相帮助，互相观摩；节省人力、物力、财力，减少开支，提高信誉，也便于接受国家的大批加工和定货，规格统一，质量一致。同时便于国家对分散的私营企业，加以指导，及可能条件下的贷款和收购。并且，能将盲目竞争，互相排挤的现象，加以调整，这些都已经由各地联营经验证明了的。至于所有的上述缺点，只要公家注意领导，加以私营企业界自己的努力，是可以逐渐克服的。
    四、联营的领导问题
    上面已经说过，联营必须要有国营经济的领导，凡是领导比较切实的地区和城市，联营就做得较好。大多数的联营组织和办法，是经过当地政府的推动扶持及指导的，对领导的原则问题，必须注意：
    第一，联营前应重视条件成熟与否，事先酝酿，经过调查研究，必须充分防止急性病或盲目进行联营，免得联营后又发生纠纷。
    第二，生产方向上，应尽可能加以帮助，指出那些行业有前途，那些地区有销路。必须防止联营组织之间，发生不必要的盲目竞争。
    第三，注意联营中的互相团结，协商办事，减少纠纷。采用适当方式，加强思想教育，纠正可能发生的毛病。
    第四，对联营的指导方式，各地经验证明，应依据不同的实际条件，在统一政策下，具体而灵活地运用。例如：
    （一）经过加工和定货，指导联营。这是很有效的，例如天津领导砖瓦业联营，白铁业联营等等都是经过加工订货推动起来的，同时并帮助它们，解决当时粮煤的困难。
    （二）在可能条件下，公家参加联营。如公私银行的联合贷款，上海的公私营工厂联合购棉处，苏南棉纺联营处，国家贸易公司参加了一部分资金，政府起了推动和指导作用。但是，并不是什么行业政府都要直接去参加，因为这在实际上是有很多困难的。
    （三）通过同业公会推动联营，必要时工商局直接负责去帮助和领导联营组织，都有很大的作用。
    五、做好联营的重要条件
    第一，必须确实掌握原料和销路，求其产销平衡，才能持久。因此，各行业联营后，应极力想各种办法，面对国内广大农村市场，以农民与城市广大的劳动人民为主要销售对象，多生产他们所需要的东西。同时，再采用各种办法，去争取外销的市场。另外接受国家的加工定货，运用代销等方式，以保证销路和利润。对于目前生产已相当过剩的行业，例如卷烟业、造胰业、火柴等等，联营必须制订产销计划，求得产销平衡；否则解决不了销路问题，联营起来便会发生纠纷，难以维持。
    第二，参加联营应以自愿为原则，不能施用任何程度或任何方式的强迫。如果在思想上对联营没有认识，勉强来参加联营，反要增加联营内部的麻烦。例如北京群众袜厂联营，其中有一家根本对联营缺乏认识，参加时有点碍于情面，半途仍然退出联营，而其它四家，因出于自愿，坚持到现在。
    第三，事先应对准备参加联营的各厂情况作深入调查，并应经过充分的酝酿，制定协议，议好章程细则，推选有威望、办事公正的积极分子来担任联营领导组织的工作。奖励进步的技术和工作态度，提倡订生产计划，注意质量和规格，评定价格……等等。
    总之，联营要想做好，一方面必需有政府的正确指导，另方面，也需要联营企业本身的努力。
