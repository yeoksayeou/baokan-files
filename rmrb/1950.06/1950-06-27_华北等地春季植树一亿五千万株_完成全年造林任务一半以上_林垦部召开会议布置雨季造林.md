Xinhua News Agency: In order to summarize the afforestation experience of North China this spring and to arrange for rainy season afforestation work, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government convened a meeting of forestry cadres from Shanxi, Chahar, Hebei, Pingyuan, Suiyuan, Shandong, and Henan provinces from June 5th to 8th. Representatives from Northeast and Northwest China also attended. Shi Yudian (a farmer), the famous tree-planting hero from Pingyuan Province, also participated in the meeting.

In his concluding report at the meeting, Minister Liang Xi pointed out that, according to incomplete statistics, the five provinces of North China and Shandong and Henan provinces planted a total of more than 150 million trees this spring, which is equivalent to more than 54% of the total afforestation task for the year. The achievements of Pingyuan, Chahar, and Shanxi provinces in spring afforestation have already exceeded their total achievements for the entire previous year. The reason why the aforementioned provinces and regions were able to achieve these results in afforestation this spring are due to the following reasons:

First, governments at all levels vigorously implemented the forest protection policy. This year, all regions have appropriately strengthened and expanded forestry professional institutions, and actively established and restored nurseries and forest farms. Provincial leading organs have also attached unprecedented importance to forest protection work this year. Zhang Su, Chairman of Chahar Province, personally conducted an in-depth inspection and review of the case of damage to the forest trees on Cier Mountain in Zhangjiakou, and submitted a report to the Central People's Government on the details of the case and the review. Shanxi Province also promptly handled some cases of damage to forest trees and personnel who failed to protect forests effectively; registered timber and organized unified supply and marketing of timber. All these measures have increased the people's enthusiasm for afforestation.

Second, responsible cadres at all levels went deep among the people to call for and organize afforestation, launching a broad mass afforestation movement. For example, Zhang Su, Chairman of Chahar Province, personally served as the director of the Zhangjiakou Afforestation Committee, promoting the participation of personnel from more than 100 agencies in the province in spring afforestation work, planting trees on 9,280 mu. This spring, the county magistrate of Wanquan County personally led cadres to lead the people in planting trees across the mountains. In the eight key sandy waste afforestation counties in western Hebei, under the joint efforts of the county governments and the afforestation bureau, more than 100,000 people were mobilized for afforestation, completing more than 63,200 mu of farmland and riverbank protection forests, and planting more than 5.46 million trees. During the afforestation movement, Hebei, Shandong, Pingyuan and other provinces also organized the masses to form afforestation cooperatives with labor, tree seedlings, cash, and land as shares, opening up a new and important way for large-scale afforestation in the future. Under the call and cultivation of governments at all levels, a large number of tree-planting heroes and models have emerged in various places. They played a central role in the afforestation movement.

Minister Liang pointed out: We cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements, but must achieve greater results. In order to improve our work, we should carefully examine and correct the shortcomings in our work.

Minister Liang also emphasized the direction of afforestation in the future. He believes that in order to solve the serious wind, sand, water, and drought disasters in Chinese agriculture, and to supply the large amount of timber urgently needed for future industrial construction, we must have the foresight to identify such a direction: that is, to aim at the purposeful and planned elimination of barren mountains and wastelands and carry out large-scale afforestation as the main direction of afforestation. At the same time, we must distinguish this large-scale afforestation from the sporadic tree planting by the masses in principle, so as to avoid ideological ambiguity in the direction of afforestation. We should also realize that large-scale afforestation is an arduous and difficult task, and we must resolutely follow the mass line, organize the masses to carry out cooperative afforestation, or public-private cooperative afforestation, in order to achieve greater results.

Regarding the work plan, Minister Liang requested that the shortcomings of some plans that are not realistic should be overcome. In the future, attention should be paid to the following when making plans: (1) A prior investigation and research must be conducted on suitable afforestation land, seedlings, labor, etc. If there are not enough people, even a rough survey is better than no survey at all. (2) After the plan is made, it must be submitted from top to bottom to the production meetings at all levels from the province to the village for discussion and modification, so that the plan becomes the plan of governments at all levels and the people. (3) A strict inspection system should be established to regularly check the implementation of the plan, and the plan can be appropriately modified when it is found to be inconsistent with the actual situation.

Finally, Minister Liang also gave specific instructions on the implementation of rainy season afforestation. He called for the rainy season to be listed as one of the main afforestation seasons in North China, and as one of the main tasks of summer production in rural areas. It is necessary to select key points, conduct in-depth publicity and education, break traditional habits and conservative thinking, remember the experience and lessons of spring afforestation, strengthen planning, effectively master technology, and improve the survival rate. Each province is required to aim at completing more than 20% of the annual afforestation plan during the rainy season.

　　华北等地春季植树一亿五千万株
    完成全年造林任务一半以上
    林垦部召开会议布置雨季造林
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府林垦部为总结华北本年春季造林经验，并布置雨季造林工作，在六月五日至八日召开了山西、察哈尔、河北、平原、绥远和山东、河南七省的林业干部会议。东北、西北也派有代表列席。平原省著名的植树英雄石玉殿（农民）也参加了这次会议。
    梁希部长在会议的总结报告中指出：根据不完全的统计，华北五省和山东、河南两省，本年春季所完成的植树，共有一亿五千余万株，已相当于本年全年造林任务总数的百分之五十四以上。单平原、察哈尔和山西省，春季植树造林的成绩，就已超出他们去年全年的总成绩。上述省区在今春的造林工作所以能够作出这些成绩，有下列的几个原因：
    第一，各级政府大力贯彻了护林政策。各地区今年都适当地加强和扩充了林业专业机构，积极建立和恢复苗圃和林场；各省省级领导机关今年也空前重视了护林的工作。察省张苏主席对张家口赐儿山林木遭到破坏一案，曾亲自进行深入的检查和检讨，并就该案经过情形和检讨向中央人民政府提出了报告。山西省也及时地处理了一些破坏林木的案件与护林不力的人员；登记了木材并组织了木材的统一供销。所有这些措施，都提高了人民对造林的积极性。
    第二，各级政府负责干部深入人民群众号召与组织造林，展开了一个广泛的群众造林运动。如察省张苏主席亲任张家口市造林委员会的主任，推动了该省一百多个机关的人员参加春季造林工作，植树达九千二百八十亩。该省万全县县长今春曾亲率干部，翻山越岭地领导人民植树。河北西部地区的八个沙荒造林重点县，在各县政府和造林局的通力合作下，发动了十万余人造林，共完成农地和河岸防护林六万三千二百余亩，植树达五百四十六万余株。造林运动中，河北、山东、平原等省还组织了群众以劳力、树秧、现款及土地等入股的造林合作社，开辟了今后大规模造林的一个新的重要的途径。在各级政府的号召和培养下，各地涌现了大批的植树英雄和模范。他们在造林运动中起了核心的作用。
    梁部长指出：我们不能满足于已有的成绩，而要收得更大的成绩。为着把工作更提高一步，就应该很好地检讨和改正我们工作中的缺点。
    梁部长同时强调地提出了今后造林的方向问题。他认为：要解决中国农业上严重的风、沙、水、旱灾害，以及供应今后工业建设所迫切需要的大量木材，必须要有远见地认定这样一个方向：即是要以有目的、有计划地消灭荒山荒地，进行大面积造林为主要造林方向。同时，要把这种大面积造林和群众的零星植树，从原则上区别开来，以免在造林方向问题上发生思想模糊。还应该认识到：大面积造林是繁重艰巨的任务，必须坚决走群众路线，组织群众进行合作造林，或公私合作造林，才能收到较大成效。
    关于工作计划问题，梁部长要求克服某些计划不切合实际的缺点；今后作计划应注意：（一）必须在事先作好对宜林地、种苗、劳动力等的调查研究。如人手不够，即使调查得概略点，也比毫无调查要好。（二）作好计划后，必须自上而下地提到从省到村的各极生产会议上去讨论、修改，使这个计划成为各级政府的和人民群众自己的计划。（三）要严格建立检查制度，经常检查执行计划的情况，发现计划不切合实际情况时可适当地加以修改。
    最后，梁部长对雨季造林的进行，也作了具体的指示。他号召把雨季列为华北造林的主要造林季节之一，并列为农村中夏季生产的主要任务之一。要选择重点，深入宣传教育，打破传统习惯与保守思想，记取春季造林的经验教训，加强计划性，切实掌握技术，提高成活率，要求各省在雨季中以争取完成全年造林计划的百分之二十以上为目标。
