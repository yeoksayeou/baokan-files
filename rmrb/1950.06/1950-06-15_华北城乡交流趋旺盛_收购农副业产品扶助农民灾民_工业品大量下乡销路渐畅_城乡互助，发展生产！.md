Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 13th: Since May, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in North China has gradually become more active. State-owned specialized trading companies purchased a large number of agricultural and sideline products in May. The amount of ginned cotton purchased by the companies in May exceeded that of April by more than 32 percent; various oils amounted to more than 1.4 million jin, and various oilseeds amounted to more than 14.7 million jin; the amount of oilseeds purchased exceeded that of April by more than 185 percent; 219,000 jin of processed bristles and 215,000 jin of raw bristles were purchased, with the purchase volume of processed bristles exceeding that of April by 97 percent and raw bristles exceeding by 47 percent. In addition, large quantities of egg products, mountain goods, medicinal materials, straw braid, homespun cloth, etc. were also purchased. At the same time, the companies also transferred a large number of industrial products to the countryside for sale; the amount of various fabrics, soda ash, sugar and other daily necessities transferred and sold to the countryside by the companies in May reached about twice the total amount transferred in April; the amount of cotton yarn transferred exceeded that of April by 180 percent, and the total amount of kerosene transferred reached more than 276,000 gallons.

When purchasing local agricultural products, the companies appropriately increased the prices of agricultural products to take care of the interests of farmers. For example, in Shijiazhuang, the ratio of peanuts to millet was 1:1.6 jin in January, and increased to 1:2.34 jin in May; the ratio of peanut oil to millet also increased from 1:3.2 jin to 1:5 jin.

The purchase of agricultural and sideline products supported the disaster-stricken people in overcoming the famine. For example, the Pig Bristle Company entrusted the North China Cooperative Supply and Marketing General Office to purchase pig hair produced in Shanxi and Pingyuan provinces, and organized local farmers to process it locally, supporting the local sideline production. The Tangshan branch of the North China Native Produce Company prepaid for 2 million jin of chestnuts produced by disaster victims in Qianxi County, with the advance payment equivalent to 1.8 million jin of millet.

After the active exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in North China, a large number of industrial products went to the countryside, and the operation of some commodities has changed from loss to profit. For example, the selling price of "Gongzi" vulcanized blue in April was lower than the cost by 18 percent, but in mid-May, it was 1.77 to 4.68 percent higher than the cost; the loss of "foreign money" soap per box turned from 3 percent in March to a profit of 2 percent. The phenomenon of price inversion between production and sales areas has also been gradually reversed. For example, in April, the price of cotton cloth per piece in Tianjin was 30,000 to 40,000 yuan higher than in Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, and Guihua, and sales were sluggish; in May, the price in other places was higher than in Tianjin, and merchants found it profitable to transport and sell, and sales have gradually improved.

　　华北城乡交流趋旺盛
    收购农副业产品扶助农民灾民
    工业品大量下乡销路渐畅
    城乡互助，发展生产！
    【新华社天津十三日电】华北地区的城乡物资交流自五月份以来，已渐趋活跃。国营各贸易专业公司曾在五月份收购大量农、副业产品。各公司五月份所收购的皮棉超过四月份的百分之三十二强；各种油品一百四十万余斤，各种油料一千四百七十万余斤；油料收购量超过四月份的百分之一百八十五强；收购熟鬃二十一万九千余斤，生鬃二十一万五千余斤，熟鬃收购量超过四月份百分之九十七，生鬃超过百分之四十七。此外还收购了大批蛋品、山货、药材、草帽辫、土布等。同时各公司又调运大量工业产品向农村推销；各公司五月份所调拨销售于农村的各种布匹、碱面、糖类等日用品约达四月份调拨总额的两倍；棉纱调拨量超过四月份的百分之一百八十，煤油调拨的总数达二十七万六千余加仑。
    各公司在收购当地农产品时，适当提高了农产品的价格，以照顾农民的利益。如石家庄一月份花生米与小米的比值为一比一点六斤，五月份增为一比二点三四斤；花生油与小米的比值亦由一比三点二斤增至一比五斤。
    农业副产品的收购支持了灾区人民的度荒。如猪鬃公司委托华北合作供销总社代购山西、平原两省所产猪毛，组织当地农民就地加工，扶植了该地副业生产。华北土产公司唐山支公司曾预购迁西县灾民所产栗子二百万斤，预付款折合小米一百八十万斤。
    华北城乡物资交流活跃后，大量工业品下乡，部分商品经营已由亏本变为有利，如公字硫化青四月份售价低于成本百分之十八，五月中旬已高出百分之一点七七至四点六八；洋钱皂每箱由三月份亏本百分之三转为盈利百分之二。产销地区差价倒悬现象也被逐渐扭转。如四月份津市棉布每匹价格较太原、张家口、归绥等地高出三、四万元，销路呆滞；五月份外地价格高于津市，客商贩运有利，销路已渐畅。
