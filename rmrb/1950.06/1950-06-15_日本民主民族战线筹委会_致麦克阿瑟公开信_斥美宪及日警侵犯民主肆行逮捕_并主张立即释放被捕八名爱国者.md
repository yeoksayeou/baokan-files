Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 14th: It is learned here that the Preparatory Committee of the Japanese Democratic National United Front delivered an open letter to MacArthur a few days ago, which was passed at a conference in Tokyo on June 3rd. The letter stated: The Preparatory Committee of the Japanese Democratic National United Front urges MacArthur to pay attention to certain prominent facts related to the events that occurred during the mass demonstration in Tokyo on May 30th. The letter cited the following facts: "(1) One of your soldiers, without any reason, used the authority of the Supreme Commander's Headquarters to interrogate a patriotic Japanese worker who had exposed a Japanese plainclothes policeman engaged in detective activities that day. This policeman violated the Far Eastern Commission's resolution on the Japanese labor movement. Such behavior cannot be considered democratic.
    (2) One of your soldiers, who was present with the people participating in the conference, attempted to arrest a patriotic worker holding a trade union flag without any reason when the flag touched the soldier's head. We cannot consider this kind of action reasonable.
    (3) Several of your soldiers, including military police, arrested six workers on the same day when the workers participating in the march and demonstration—the patriots—passed through the stadium in Hibiya Park. The soldiers did not explain the reasons for the arrest, but brutally pushed and beat the arrestees. When two patriots representing the group went to the Central Police Headquarters to demand the immediate release of the arrestees, they were also arrested on the spot by the American military police, without stating the reasons for the detention. Because we are human, not dogs, we believe that this behavior is not democratic, but a rude atrocity. We insist on demanding the immediate release of the eight patriots.
    (4) According to reports, the eight arrested Japanese workers and students are considered to have committed the crime of violence against the occupation personnel and have been sent to a military court for trial. However, none of the eight participated in the actions reported in the newspaper. Yomiuri Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, and other Japanese newspapers deliberately distorted the incident. With the same purpose, The Japan Times openly stated in one issue that the slogans written on the flags, such as "Strive for peace," "Oppose war," "Iers, we hate you to death!" and "We don't want to see the Hiroshima incident repeated," all contained anti-occupation elements. We believe that such reporting is intentionally violating the current press regulations.
    (5) The next day, the eight arrestees were brought to a military court. Initially, the defendants had neither a defense lawyer nor witnesses. The trial continued until late at night. Inside the Tokyo Police Headquarters where the trial was held, the above-mentioned eight patriots were subjected to abuse and were not even allowed to wash. All of this is reminiscent of court trials under colonial rule."
    In conclusion, the letter stated that the task of the Japanese Democratic National United Front is: "We want to fight for the following points: (1) Oppose war and the manufacture of atomic weapons, establish international control of atomic energy, and judge the government that first uses atomic weapons as a war criminal. (2) Immediately sign a comprehensive peace treaty, and all occupying forces should be withdrawn immediately after the treaty is signed. (3) Strive for normal living conditions, strive for peace, and strive for national independence."
    The letter was signed by Nakahara Junkichi on behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the Democratic National United Front.
    According to reports, the open letter from the Preparatory Committee of the Japanese Democratic National United Front to MacArthur was read out on the 3rd by Nakahara Junkichi, one of the leaders of the Preparatory Committee and the All-Japan Metalworkers' Union, at the "General Uprising Conference to Break Through the Industrial Crisis" sponsored by the All-Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union. The US and Japanese reactionaries falsely claimed that the letter "slandered the occupying forces." Since the 6th, they have illegally arrested Nakahara Junkichi and several trade union leaders related to the reading of the letter, such as Sato Yasumasa, Chairman of the National Council of Government and Public Workers' Unions, and have illegally searched thirty trade unions for this reason.

　　日本民主民族战线筹委会
    致麦克阿瑟公开信       
    斥美宪及日警侵犯民主肆行逮捕
    并主张立即释放被捕八名爱国者
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社平壤十三日讯：此间获悉，日本民主民族战线筹备委员会数日前将六月三日在东京一大会上通过的一封公开信送达麦克阿瑟。该信称：日本民主民族战线筹备委员会促请麦克阿瑟注意与五月三十日在东京群众示威时所发生的事件有关的若干突出事实。该信举出下列事实：“（一）你处兵士之一，并无任何理由，运用统帅总部的职权，盘问一个有爱国思想的日本工人，此人曾于是日揭露一个从事侦探活动的日本便衣警察，该警察违犯了远东委员会关于日本工人运动的决议。这类行为是不能认为民主的。
    （二）与参加大会的人民一起在场的你处兵士之一，毫无任何理由，企图将任何一个手执工会旗帜的爱国工人，在他的旗帜碰着这个士兵的头时，加以逮捕。我们不能认为这一类的行动是合理的。
    （三）你处有好几个兵士，包括宪兵，于同日当参加游行示威的工人们——爱国者们——经过日比谷公园的运动场时，逮捕了六名工人。兵士们并不解释逮捕的理由，却残暴地推拖与殴打被捕者。代表中有二名爱国者到中央警察本部要求立即释放被捕者时，也当场遭美国宪兵逮捕，但并未说明拘禁的理由。因为我们是人，不是狗，所以我们相信这种行为并不民主，而是粗鲁的暴行。我们坚持要求立即释放八名爱国者。
    （四）据报载，八名被捕的日本工人与学生被认为犯有对占领人员施行暴行的罪名，并已解赴军事法庭审讯。但八人中实无一人参加过报上所载的行动。读卖新闻、每日新闻、朝日新闻及其他日本报纸均故意曲解此次事件。抱着同样的目的，日本时报在有一期里竟公然说：那些写在旗帜上的“争取和平”、“反对战争”、“意尔斯，我们讨厌死了你！”、“我们不愿看见广岛事件重演”等口号，都含有反占领的性质。我们相信这样的报道，是有意违犯现行的新闻条例。
    （五）次日，被捕的八人都被提到军事法庭。在最初，被告既无辩护律师，也无证人。审讯继续到深夜。在举行审讯的东京警察本部内，上述八名爱国者备受虐待，甚至不准盥洗。所有这一切都令人想起在殖民地统治下的法庭审讯的情形。”
    在结束时，该信讲到日本民主民族战线的任务为：“我们要为以下各点而斗争：（一）反对战争与制造原子武器，建立原子能国际管制，判定首先使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯。（二）立即签订全面和约，和约订立后应立即撤退一切占领军。（三）争取正常的生活条件，争取和平，争取民族独立”。
    该信由中原淳吉代表民主民族战线筹备委员会签字。
    按日本民主民族战线筹备委员会致麦克阿瑟的公开信，曾于三日由该筹委会及全日金属工人工会的负责人之一中原淳吉在全日汽车产业工人工会主办的“突破产业危机总奋起大会”上宣读。美、日反动派诬称该信“诽谤占领军”，六日起曾先后非法逮捕中原淳吉及与宣读该信有关的全国官厅职工工会协议会主席佐藤安政等工会领袖数人，并曾为此非法搜查了三十个工会。
