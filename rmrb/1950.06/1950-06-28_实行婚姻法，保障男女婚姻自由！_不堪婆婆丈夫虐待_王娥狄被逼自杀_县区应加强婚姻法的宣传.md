Implement the Marriage Law, Protect Freedom of Marriage for Men and Women!
　　Unable to Endure Abuse from Mother-in-Law and Husband
    Wang E'di Forced to Commit Suicide
    County and District Should Strengthen the Publicity of the Marriage Law
    Wang E'di, the daughter of Wang Ru of Dongxinzhai, Fifth District, Yongnian County, Hebei Province, is twenty years old this year. After divorcing Bai Xicheng's son in the same village last year, she married Zheng Hongsheng (twenty-three years old) of Qihexinzhai in July of the old lunar calendar last year. At that time, the two had a good relationship. However, after the marriage, Zheng Hongsheng's mother (née Zheng Gao) treated Wang E'di very badly, and often spoke ill of Wang E'di to Zheng Hongsheng. As a result, Zheng Hongsheng gradually became bad to Wang E'di as well, often beating and scolding her. Zheng Gao had adulterous behavior with Zhang Huidi, the village office secretary. Wang E'di often exposed her mother-in-law's shortcomings when she was upset. This made Zheng Gao even more angry, and she regarded Wang E'di as a thorn in her side.
    In February of this year, the spindle Wang E'di was spinning was bent. She asked the daughter-in-law of her western neighbor, Hou Mingshan, to fix it for her. Hongsheng then beat her. Wang E'di went to the government to request a divorce, but was stopped by neighbors and relatives. The matter reached the village government. The village cadres did not mediate reasonably, but instead used their authority to suppress Wang E'di's divorce request. Police officer Dong Nuodi (a member of the Communist Party village branch committee) even reprimanded Wang E'di, saying, "This one isn't good, that one isn't good, only you are good!" Wang E'di had no choice but to go to her mother's house to stay. The next day, Dong Nuodi and Zheng Baodi (a member of the Communist Party village branch committee), the secretary of the Communist Youth League village branch, went to Wang Ru's house and forced Wang E'di to go to her husband's house. Zheng Baodi also said, "You want a divorce? It's as hard as climbing to the sky! Even if you die in his house, you won't get a divorce." At that time, Wang E'di was desperate and once wanted to jump into a well to commit suicide. On April 17th of this year, Wang E'di returned from gleaning wheat. She said to Sister-in-law Shenghua in the same courtyard, "My mother still thinks I didn't glean enough." As she was speaking, her mother-in-law came in, and they started arguing. Wang E'di again spoke of her mother-in-law's shortcomings. Zheng Hongsheng then beat and scolded Wang E'di. His uncle's elder brother, Zheng Shenghua (a Communist Party member), also cheered him on from the side. Wang E'di, in a fit of anger, threw herself into the well in the northeast corner of the courtyard. At this time, Zheng Gao, Zheng Hongsheng, Zheng Shenghua, and others did not think of trying to save her, but instead sent someone to Wang Ru's house in Dongxinzhai to call for people to come and retrieve her. By the time Wang E'di was pulled out of the well, it was too late to save her. Afterwards, the village cadres sent Zheng Hongsheng to the district. That night, District Chief Gu of the Fifth District and Judicial Assistant Comrade Li went to the village to investigate. The county people's court also sent people to the village to investigate once. Zheng Hongsheng has now been sent to the county people's court for detention.
    Zheng Gao and Zheng Hongsheng abused Wang E'di, forcing Wang E'di to commit suicide in anger. We suggest that the county people's court give them the punishment they deserve. Communist Party village branch committee member and police officer Dong Nuodi, Communist Youth League branch secretary Zheng Baodi, Communist Party member Zheng Shenghua, and others suppressed women's freedom of marriage, which is also wrong. They should also be held responsible for this incident of Wang E'di being forced to commit suicide.
              Zhan Gui
    Editor's Note: From the situation described in the letter above, Comrade Zhan Gui's opinion is correct: Not only should her husband and mother-in-law be held responsible for Wang E'di's suicide, but the relevant village cadres should also bear considerable responsibility. It is hoped that the local government will handle this case seriously. At the same time, this case shows that some village cadres and masses still do not understand the Marriage Law, and some resist the Marriage Law ideologically and in action. Therefore, the local county and district governments should systematically check the cadres' understanding of the Marriage Law, make specific arrangements for publicity and education on the Marriage Law, earnestly correct the erroneous ideas of disrespect for women's rights among some cadres and the masses, and first correct the erroneous ideas of party member cadres.

    实行婚姻法，保障男女婚姻自由！
　　不堪婆婆丈夫虐待
    王娥狄被逼自杀
    县区应加强婚姻法的宣传
    河北省永年县五区东辛砦王儒的闺女王娥狄，今年二十岁。她在去年和本村白喜成的儿子离婚后，于去年旧历七月和骑河辛砦郑鸿生（二十三岁）结婚。当时，两人感情很好。可是结婚后郑鸿生的母亲（郑高氏）待王娥狄很不好，并且常常对郑鸿生说王娥狄坏话。因此，郑鸿生对王娥狄也渐渐坏起来，经常打她骂她。郑高氏跟村公所书记张会狄有通奸行为。王娥狄常常在受气时揭发婆婆这个短处。这样，郑高氏更加恼怒，便把王娥狄看成眼中钉。
    今年二月间，王娥狄纺花的锭子弯了。她叫西邻侯明善的儿媳妇给她掏了掏。鸿生就打她。王娥狄到政府去要求离婚，被邻家和亲戚拦回来了。事情闹到了村政府。村干部们并不合理调解，反而利用职权，压制王娥狄的离婚要求。公安员董挪狄（中共村支部委员）还训斥王娥狄说：“这头也不好，那头也不好，就是你好！”王娥狄没法，便到娘家去住。第二天，董挪狄和青年团村支部书记郑堡狄（中共村支部委员）到王儒家，硬逼着王娥狄到婆家去。郑堡狄还说：“你想离婚比登天还难！死到他家里也离不了。”当时王娥狄走头无路，曾一度想跳井自杀。今年四月十七日，王娥狄拾麦子回来。她对同院的生华嫂说：“俺娘还嫌俺拾的少哩。”正说着，婆婆进来了，便吵了起来。王娥狄又说到了她婆婆的短处。郑鸿生便对王娥狄打骂交加。他叔伯哥哥郑生华（中共党员），也在旁助威喝打。王娥狄一时气愤，就投入院东北角的井内。此时，郑高氏、郑鸿生、郑生华等竟不想法打救，反派人到东辛砦王儒家叫人来捞。到王娥狄从井内被捞出来时，已经无救了。事后，村干部把郑鸿生送到区里。当夜五区谷区长、司法助理李同志同到该村检验。县人民法院也派人到该村检验了一次。现已把郑鸿生送押县人民法院。
    郑高氏、郑鸿生虐待王娥狄，逼使王娥狄愤而自杀。我们建议该县人民法院给他们以应得的处分。中共村支部委员兼公安员董挪狄、青年团支部书记郑堡狄、中共党员郑生华等压制妇女婚姻自由，也是错误的。他们对这次王娥狄被逼自杀事件，亦应负责任。
              展圭
    编者按：从上面这封信所叙述的情况看来，展圭君的意见是对的：王娥狄自杀事件，不但她的丈夫和婆婆应负责任，各有关村干部亦应负相当责任。望当地政府严正处理这一案件。同时，这个案件说明了一部分村干部和群众还不懂得婚姻法，有的在思想上和行动上抗拒婚姻法。因此，当地县区政府应有计划地检查干部对婚姻法的认识，具体布置关于婚姻法的宣传教育工作，切实纠正某些干部和群众中蔑视女权的错误思想，而且首先纠正党员干部的错误思想。
