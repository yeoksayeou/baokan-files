　　The Emancipated Peasant Dong Jinshui
    Chai Yuzong
    Dong Jinshui, the director of the Jixian Village Farmers' Association in the 14th District of the Beijing suburbs, always carries two treasures with him: a black pencil and a notebook. He asks everyone he meets and writes whenever he has time. He was originally illiterate, but now he can write notes and read workers' textbooks.
    Dong Jinshui is thirty-two years old this year. He started working as a hired farmhand at the age of fifteen, serving landlords and wealthy people as a beast of burden for more than ten years. In the past, poor people blamed their fate. Dong Jinshui often said: "God is truly blind, creating so many poor people!"
    If God is blind, the eyes of the people are discerning. Last spring, Beijing was liberated. In November, land reform was carried out in the village. The peasants elected Dong Jinshui as the director of the Farmers' Association. In leading the peasants' emancipation movement, he worked hard and diligently, regardless of day or night, wind or snow, often running from the east of the village to the west, from this village to that village, sometimes even forgetting to eat. He said: "Now that we poor people are the masters, cadres should serve everyone well." His selfless spirit has deeply won the support of the peasants in the village. After the land reform, he was re-elected as the director of the Farmers' Association.
    Because of his active work and faithful service to the people, he was approved as a member of the Chinese Communist Party last December.
    In his work, Dong Jinshui tasted the bitterness of illiteracy. He often said indignantly: "The landlords really harmed us poor people! We worked for them, plowing the land, and toiling all day long until our backs ached, only to end up illiterate." He asked the comrades of the work team in the village: "If I am illiterate, have a simple mind, and know little, I cannot do my job well, what should I do?" The comrades of the work team told him: "Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it. As long as you are determined to learn, you can learn anything."
    Dong Jinshui remembered this sentence.
    On one occasion when going to market, Dong Jinshui bought a pencil and some scrap paper. He went home and bound them into a notebook. The pencil and notebook became his closest friends. He asked and wrote whenever he saw someone who was literate. He asked people to explain and write down any new terms he heard. His notebook was filled with black scribbles: Party member, branch, feudalism, landlord.... These words were unfamiliar to him not long ago, but now he can say, write, speak, and use them. In addition to studying in his spare time, he also goes to the village literacy class every other day to study for two hours. He has already finished the first volume of the workers' textbook and is reading the second volume. He is also learning to use an abacus and do arithmetic. He plans to learn addition and subtraction this year and learn to keep simple accounts. For convenience, he is also learning the "Hundred Family Surnames."
    From the beginning to now, in just four or five months, Dong Jinshui has learned three or four hundred characters. Someone asked him how he was learning? He said modestly: "I am still far behind, I can only write a simple note."

　　翻身农民董金水
    柴玉宗
    京郊十四区集贤村农会主任董金水，常常随身带着两件宝贝：黑铅笔，笔记本，他逢人便问，有空就写。原先大字不识，如今已经能开便条、能读工人课本了。
    董金水今年三十二。他从十五岁开始当长工，整整地给地主老财当了十几年的牛马。过去，人穷怨命。董金水常说：老天爷真不长眼，生下这么多的穷人！
    老天爷不长眼，人民的眼睛可是雪亮的。去年开春，北京解放。十一月间，该村进行了土地改革。农民选举董金水当了农会主任。在领导农民翻身运动中，他刻苦耐劳，不管黑夜白天，不管大风大雪，常常从村东跑到村西，从这村跑到那村，有时连饭都顾不得吃。他说：现在咱们穷人做主人了，干部应当好好给大家办事。他的大公无私的精神，深深得到该村农民的拥护。土地改革过后，他又被选为农会主任。
    由于他工作积极，忠实地为人民服务，去年十二月间，他被批准为中国共产党员。
    在工作中，董金水尝尽了不识字的苦处。他常愤愤地说：“地主真害死咱穷人了！咱成年给他们扛活，种地，整天累得腰酸腿疼，到头落个大字不识。”他找到该村工作组同志问道：“不识字，脑筋简单，知道的少，作不好工作，怎么办？”工作组同志告诉他：天下无难事，只怕有心人。只要下决心学习，什么东西都能够学会。
    董金水记下了这句话。
    在一次赶集的时候，董金水买了一支铅笔，一些废纸。回家订了个本子。笔和本子成了他最亲密的朋友。他见了识字的就问，就写。听见个新名词就让人给解释，给记下。他的本本上，黑鸦鸦地写满了：党员、支部、封建、地主……。这些字眼，不久以前对他还是陌生的，现在他已能说，能写，能讲，能用了。除了平时学习外，他每隔一天还要到村识字班去学习两个钟头。他已经读完了工人课本第一册，正读第二册。他又学习打算盘和笔算。他计划今年学会加减法，学会记简单的账。为了方便，“百家姓”，他也学。
    从开始到现在，不过短短四、五个月的功夫，董金水已经学会三、四百字了。有人问他学得怎样了？他很谦虚地说：还差的多，才能开个便条。
