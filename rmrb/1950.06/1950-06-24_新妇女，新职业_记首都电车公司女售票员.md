　　New Women, New Occupations
    ——A Record of Female Conductors at the Capital Tram Company
    Han Zhenxing, Ning Yuantao
    In May of this year, the tram company recruited twelve female conductors. Before the recruitment, the Party, government, labor union, and youth league of the tram company had held thorough discussions, considering whether women could undertake conductor work. After a period of struggle, the final decision was: resolutely open up new paths for the women of New China.

    Among the twelve female conductors, some volunteered and were recommended by the labor bureau; others came with the encouragement and assistance of the organization. Among them, three were labor heroes and model workers from clothing factories. Of the twelve, nine were members of the Youth League, including two probationary Party members.

    On June 2nd, they officially arrived at the tram company. The administration and the labor union set a curriculum for them: focusing on professional skills, supplemented by politics, in addition to studying relevant enterprise management documents. During the learning process, the labor union explained the current labor union work and the situation of group life. The labor union was also preparing to explain and publicize to male members in various meetings that they should unite and help them well, and not look at them with feudal and backward eyes.

    On the afternoon of the 11th, the administration and the labor union mobilized off-duty drivers to operate the "May 1st Labor Day" tram, making three round trips from Dongdan to Xizhimen, for them to practice selling tickets. Each of them worked with extreme caution. Passengers also tried their best to help them calculate fares. After their first ticket sales, female conductor Zhao Ailian said: "When selling the first ticket, I was very flustered, and couldn't find the place to mark the stops; but after selling a few tickets, I became more familiar with it and became interested. We all rushed to sell them." That day, they sold a total of 169,400 yuan worth of tickets, and the accounting matched the exact amount. Their first time on the tram for practice left such good results.

    They talked about their motives for joining the tram company: When applying, they did have concerns, fearing they couldn't do it, fearing that people would satirize and despise them, but, they said: "When we think of the female train drivers and female tram drivers in the Northeast, we gained courage! Furthermore, thinking that under the leadership of the Communist Party, any difficulty can be overcome, our courage increased even more. Now we want to use the strength of young people to overcome all difficulties." They have already developed an internship plan: First, learn from the older workers anytime and anywhere; Second, the style should be upright, and the attitude should be generous and amiable; Third, be responsible for the work, and promote the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and fraternity; Fourth, humbly accept criticism, and correct their own mistakes and shortcomings.

　　新妇女，新职业
    ——记首都电车公司女售票员
    韩振兴·宁源涛
    今年五月，电车公司招考了十二名女售票员。在招考之前，电车公司的党、政、工、团曾缜密地作了讨论。考虑妇女是否能担任售票工作。经过一番斗争，最后决定：坚决为新中国妇女开辟新道路。
    十二名女售票员中，有的是自愿向劳动局报名介绍来的；有的是经组织上鼓励和帮助而来的。其中更有三人是被服厂的劳动英雄和模范工作者。十二人中，有九人是青年团员，其中有两名是候补党员。
    六月二日，她们正式到了电车公司。行政和工会给她们定了学习课程：以业务为主，政治为辅，此外还学习了有关企业管理的文件。在学习过程中，工会方面给她们讲解了目前工会工作，及小组生活状况。工会更准备在各种会议上，向男会员解释宣传，要好好地团结、帮助她们，不要以封建的落后的眼光来看她们。
    十一日下午，行政、工会发动了落班的司机员，开着“五一劳动号”，自东单到西直门往返行驶三次，由她们实习售票。她们每人都极谨慎地工作着。乘客也尽量地帮助她们算着票价。她们第一次售票之后，女售票员赵爱莲说：“卖第一张票的时候，心里很慌乱，划站也找不着地方；可是卖了几张以后，熟悉了些，也有了兴趣，我们大伙都抢着卖。”那天她们共卖了十六万九千四百元的票，结账的时候，正好是这个数目。她们第一次上车实习，便留下了这样好的成绩。
    她们曾谈到入电车公司的动机：投考时，确实有顾虑，怕干不了，怕有人讽刺和轻视，可是，她们说：“我们一想到东北有火车女司机员和电车女司机员，我们就有了勇气！再一想，在共产党的领导下，什么困难也是能克服的，勇气更增加了。现在我们要用青年人的力量，克服一切困难”。她们已订出实习计划：一、要随时随地的向老年工友学习；二、作风要正派，态度要大方和蔼；三、对工作要负责，发扬团结互助友爱的精神；四、虚心接受批评，改正自己的错误和缺点。
