Moscow News Agency: On March 31, the organ of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, "Culture and Life," published an article by S. Vigotsky, "The Growth of Economic Crisis in Capitalist Countries," which detailed the current economic crisis in capitalist countries. The full text is as follows:

No matter what tricks bourgeois economists play, no matter what spells the imperialist bosses cast, they cannot cover up an unchangeable fact: capitalist countries are sinking deeper and deeper into a new economic crisis.

This crisis is developing under the conditions of further deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, under the conditions of weakening of the imperialist camp and the continuous strengthening of the democratic camp, at a time when the strength of the Soviet Union is growing, the people's democratic countries are consolidating, and the workers' movements and democratic movements in capitalist countries, and the national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries, are growing and expanding.

Some bourgeois economists comfort themselves by saying that the current crisis is a re-enactment of the crisis of 1920 to 1921, as if both of them were directly post-war crises. This consolation is futile. There is an essential difference here. The crisis of 1920 to 1921 developed under the conditions of the maturity of the temporary stabilization of capitalism, while the current crisis is developing under the conditions of the long-collapsed stabilization of capitalism. After the Second World War, some new countries broke away from the imperialist system, capitalism became increasingly narrow, its internal and external contradictions became increasingly acute and deepened, the balance of power on the world stage changed, and continued to change unfavorably for capitalism and favorably for socialism.

The decay and bankruptcy of the capitalist system have never been exposed so clearly as they are now, and the superiority of the socialist economic system has never been demonstrated so clearly as it is now.

The Soviet Union, which bore all the burdens in defeating German fascism and Japanese imperialism, successfully solved the task of restoring its national economy and achieved further strength of the socialist economy. The Soviet Union's industry in the fourth quarter of 1949 had already exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 by 53 percent, and exceeded the 1929 level by nine times.

In the United States, whose territory has not encountered enemies, and which made more money in the Second World War than in the First World War, the output of industrial products in 1949 was only 42.1 percent higher than the level of 1929. At the same time, since the autumn of 1948, a continuous decline in industrial production began in the United States. Truman carefully tried to convince Americans that: "Now, under God's blessing, our free country is prospering." Calling a crisis prosperity is not enough to overcome the crisis. The decline in industrial production that has occurred in the United States and other capitalist countries is nothing but a new economic crisis, the cause of which lies in the capitalist economic system.

              ★       ★         ★

The characteristics of the new economic crisis are most evident in the main capitalist country—the United States. The level of industrial production in the United States fell by 22 percent from October 1943 to October 1949. The material published by the United Nations Secretariat in the report on the world economic situation in 1949 shows that the crisis is also growing in other capitalist countries. For example, the index of industrial production in the third quarter of 1949 decreased compared with the second quarter of the same year: Norway decreased by 16.8 percent, France decreased by 13.6 percent, and Belgium decreased by 9.4 percent. During the same period, the production of pig iron and ferroalloys in Australia decreased by one-third. The compilers of the report had to declare that the decline in industrial production and the growth of unemployment in the United States and other capitalist countries of the world were "too large to be considered seasonal phenomena."

Comrade Stalin pointed out when analyzing the characteristics of the 1929 crisis: "The crisis hit the main capitalist country, the nurturer of capitalism—the United States, which concentrates in its hands no less than half of the world's production and consumption. Obviously, this situation cannot but cause a great expansion of the scope of the crisis, sharpen the crisis, and accumulate unexpected difficulties for world capitalism" (Collected Works, Volume 12, page 245). The same can be said of the current crisis. The increase in the proportion of the United States in the industry of the capitalist world compared with the pre-war period has strengthened the destructive actions of American capitalism as the source and seedbed of the crisis, causing the deepening of economic differences between the United States and other capitalist countries, especially between the United States and Britain, and weakening the position of the entire world imperialism.

The growing power of American monopoly capital, the close combination of the upper echelons of the financial oligarchy with the state machine, has strengthened the imperialist expansion of the United States, and has produced various plans for the economic and political enslavement of other countries in the capitalist world by American imperialism.

American monopoly capitalists have proposed to serve almost the entire economy of the capitalist world for themselves. They have tried in every possible way to transfer the losses in the crisis to the shoulders of the people of other capitalist countries through the Marshall Plan and similar methods. The implementation of the Marshall Plan has made the economies of Western European countries increasingly damaged. American imperialists are strangling the development of Western European industry. French industry is experiencing difficult situations: aircraft factories are closing down, and the automobile, textile, and other industrial sectors are declining. In Italy, the production of pig iron and steel in September 1949 was 60 percent of the level of 1948 and 49 percent of the level of 1938. In Belgium, the mining of coal, the smelting of pig iron and steel, and the production of textiles have been greatly reduced. The Marshall Plan, which the imperialists have widely touted, has accelerated and sharpened the economic crisis in Western European countries.

As in the period of past economic crises in the imperialist era, modern capitalist monopolies, despite overproduction, are still frantically resisting price declines. In the United States, the prices of agricultural machinery and equipment, the prices of iron and steel, and the value of automobiles continued to rise from September 1948 to September 1949. The decline in wholesale prices of agricultural products did not affect retail prices.

The resistance of capitalist monopolies to price declines strengthens the inherent disorder and anarchy of capitalism, causing the crisis to deepen and prolong.

The competition to maintain the high level of monopoly prices of the means of production prevents the process of renewal of fixed capital (which is one of the most important prerequisites for recovery and prosperity), hinders the dispersal of inventories, and gives the crisis a particularly profound, acute, and prolonged nature. In the United States, in terms of capital equipment in China, the level of 1920 had not been reached until before the Second World War; the renewal of fixed capital was reduced during the years of crisis and depression, and it was still restrained and exhausted during the years of "prosperity." In the post-war period, investment in new enterprise construction and equipment in American industry and transportation reached its maximum in 1947, and has begun to decline since 1948. And in 1949, these investments were 27 percent lower than the level of the fourth quarter of 1948.

How bleak the situation in the United States in 1949 in terms of the renewal of fixed capital can be seen from the following facts published in "Business Week" on November 5 and 26, 1949: "Throughout 1949, the replacement of lathes was 20 to 40 percent lower than the average level from 1945 to 1947." Secondly, the weekly complained about the "backwardness of the metal processing industry," complained about "equipment that does not meet the latest requirements of the times," and complained about "the trend of extending the use period of equipment typical of the 1930s has reappeared." At the same time, the weekly pointed out the large reduction in lathe exports. A large lathe manufacturing company announced: "Before the war, exports accounted for 40 percent of production, now it is 10 percent." In this way, the capitalists themselves had to admit the existence of a crisis in the renewal of fixed capital.

The contradiction between the growth of production possibilities and the relative narrowing of the market is very sharp, making a large number of existing means of labor useless, and preventing them from being replaced with new means of labor. The decay process of capitalism has developed so deeply that the economic crisis is not enough to be an effective stimulus for large-scale fixed capital renewal.

The current economic crisis is maturing in the environment of an unprecedented arms race being carried out by American imperialism, which hopes to remedy its precarious cause in a new war. The economies of the United States and the Marshallized Western European countries have not, in fact, left the track of military economy that they turned to during the years of the Second World War. It is known that the direct expenses for armaments in the United States from the 1947 (——48) fiscal year to the 1949 (——50) fiscal year reached 57.4 billion U.S. dollars, and the total amount of military expenditures reached 92.3 billion U.S. dollars, which is equal to 3.6 times that of 1941, and almost 20 times that of 1939. British military spending now costs twice as much as in 1939.

The military expansion that stimulated the "prosperity" of the United States from 1947 to 1948 was able to slightly delay the arrival of the economic crisis. It is now also able to slightly hinder the rapid development of the economic crisis, but this situation could not in the past, and cannot now, prevent the crisis or eliminate the crisis. Comrade Stalin pointed out at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks): The capitalist economy's turn to the track of military economy, the one-sidedness of industry, and the military direction put capitalist countries in the face of economic crises. Indeed, a new economic crisis has begun in the United States, which was the first of any capitalist country to militarize its economy on a large scale.

The economic crisis is hitting all aspects of the world capitalist economy. World trade in 1949 was only 95 percent of the level of 1937. American exports in 1947 were 255 percent of the level of 1938, while in 1948 they were 197 percent of the level of 1938.

The emergence of people's democratic countries in Central and Southeastern Europe and the establishment of the People's Republic of China are the most powerful blows to the entire system of world capitalism. The U.S. ruling bloc, overwhelmed by malice and fury, is implementing a discriminatory trade policy against the new China, which the U.S. ruling bloc has adopted against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries throughout the post-war period, to its own great loss. This policy can only promote the further reduction of American exports and the deepening of the economic crisis in capitalist countries.

As a result of the unlimited inflation including the entire capitalist world, the new economic crisis has become more acute. Inflation is a tool for American monopoly capital to enslave and plunder other capitalist countries. The decline in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar and the surge in the prices of goods imported from the United States by capitalist countries have increased the trade deficit of these countries. For example, the price of wheat imported from the United States, calculated in U.S. dollars, was 2.8 times higher in 1948 than in 1938, and the price of beef was four times higher.

Regarding the currency devaluation of capitalist countries after the First World War, Lenin wrote: "This fact shows that the entire world capitalist economic mechanism is disintegrating. It is impossible to continue to maintain the trade relationship of obtaining raw materials and selling finished products under the capitalist system; the reason why it cannot continue is precisely because due to the change in the value of currency, a series of countries are subject to one country." Lenin's principle profoundly exposes the contradictions that are eroding the capitalist world.

Under the guise of fighting for stable currencies, the United States forced the devaluation of the pound and other currencies, from which it obtained huge benefits. Due to the devaluation, American monopoly capital was able to stipulate the lowest prices for raw materials purchased in British, French, and other colonies. At the same time, the devaluation of the pound is Wall Street's attempt to finally bring the pound under the U.S. dollar. The devaluation of the currencies of Western European countries, as well as the decline in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar, is a reflection of the growing economic crisis in capitalist countries, which itself further promotes the deepening and complication of the economic crisis.

No country in the capitalist world now has a stable currency, and inflation is rampant everywhere. Only in the Soviet Union is there a solid and stable currency. This reflects the strength of the Soviet socialist economy and its continuous growth.

          ★            ★            ★

The new economic crisis has brought new countless disasters to the laborers of capitalist countries, a further decline in living standards, and a growth in mass unemployment and poverty. Comrade Stalin said in the summary report of the First Five-Year Plan in January 1933: "Look at the capitalist countries, what kind of terror is caused there by unemployment. There are now no less than thirty or forty million unemployed in these countries. Who are these people? It is generally said that these are 'people who have no way out'." Comrade Stalin pointed out that unemployment not only makes the unemployed suffer, but also because of the existence of a large number of unemployed, it forms the instability of the position of working workers in production and the loss of confidence in tomorrow.

The economic crisis from 1929 to 1933 was the deepest economic crisis that capitalist society has ever had. At that time, the industry of the major capitalist countries fell to the lowest point. During this period, there were no less than thirty or forty million unemployed. Now, in the process of the growth of the new economic crisis, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed in capitalist countries is no less than forty-five million.

Even the official materials of bourgeois statisticians cannot cover up the fact that the number of fully unemployed people in the United States in 1949 increased by 94.5 percent, while the number of partially unemployed people increased by 111 percent (compared with 1948). In September 1949, compared with the same month in 1948, the number of unemployed people in Belgium increased by more than two times, France—2.6 times, West Germany—more than two times, Finland—4.2 times, Australia—about two times, and Japan—1.6 times.

In capitalist countries, workers' wages and farmers' incomes are constantly shrinking, while the prices of daily necessities are growing sharply. The real wages of workers engaged in industry in the United States at the end of 1948 were 20.9 percent lower than in 1939. From October 1948 to September 1949, in the United States, wages in the coal mining industry decreased by 20 to 31.5 percent, wages in the iron manufacturing industry decreased by 6.2 percent, wages in the steel manufacturing industry decreased by 14.8 percent, and wages in the steel casting industry decreased by 14 percent. In 1949, American farmers' income decreased by 4.7 billion U.S. dollars.

The situation in European capitalist countries is even worse. For example, in France, in the period from its liberation to the end of 1947, wages decreased by 45 percent compared with the crisis year of 1938. During the same period, the profits of monopoly capital increased 15 times! In France and in other capitalist countries, the cost of living continued to grow in 1948 and 1949, while real wages continued to decline even more. According to the materials of the World Economic Situation Report, the cost of living in France in the second quarter of 1949 increased by 56 percent compared with the same period in 1948, and the cost of living in Japan increased by 47 percent, and so on.

The growth of unemployment and poverty at one end is accompanied by the growth of the fantastic profits of American monopoly capitalists. In the third quarter of 1949, when even according to official materials, the number of unemployed people in the United States doubled compared with the third quarter of 1948, the profits of "General Motors" increased by 66 percent, or 199 million U.S. dollars. During the same period, the profits of "Westinghouse" increased by 109 percent, Chrysler's profits increased by 85 percent, and DuPont's profits increased by 26 percent.

The oppression of monopoly capital intensified by inflation, the huge and increasingly growing tax burden transferred by the ruling class to the shoulders of the working masses for the purpose of preparing for a new world war, the attack of the reactionaries on the vital interests of the working class, the cancellation of the last remnants of bourgeois democracy, the revival of fascism, and finally, the preparation for war—these are the basic factors of the domestic and foreign policies of American imperialism and its Western European partners.

The imperialists are looking for a way out of the economic crisis on the road to inciting a new world war and on the road to a new enslavement of the people. However, the powerful, already organized, and growing and expanding front of peace defenders is blocking the road to a new world war and bankrupting the imperialists' aggressive plans. The imperialists are trying to transfer the burden of the crisis to the shoulders of the laborers. But they have encountered increasingly resolute resistance from the working class and all other working strata in capitalist countries. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the laborers are fighting for their rights and interests, for improving their living standards, and for bread, peace, and freedom. The strike movements unfolded in Italy and France and other capitalist countries clearly confirmed the sharpening of social contradictions in capitalist countries.

The capitalist system is collapsing, whether in the center or on the periphery, whether in the suzerain state or in the colony. If the result of the First World War was that Russia broke away from the capitalist system, then the Second World War caused a series of countries in Europe and Asia to break away from the imperialist system. Under such conditions, it is becoming more and more difficult for the imperialists to play tricks and find a way out of the crisis. The broad working masses in capitalist countries are increasingly and deeply aware that there is only one road—the socialist road—that can liberate mankind from war, poverty, and hunger.

The living strength of the Soviet socialist economic system has new proof every day. This strength is clearly expressed in the smooth implementation of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, in the continuous growth of the Soviet economy, in the unprecedented scale of capital increase (the increase in investment in economic sectors—translator's note), in the rapid development of new technologies, only the socialist system has no crisis, unemployment, and poverty. The high tide of the Soviet national economy guarantees the growth of the Soviet national income used for the benefit of the laborers. The increase in workers' real wages and farmers' incomes, and the three reductions in the prices of daily necessities from 1947 to 1950, are clear manifestations of the continuous rise in the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people.

When the capitalist economy has been rolling downward, when the economic crisis has been growing in capitalist countries, and when unemployment, poverty, and hunger are entrenched, the Soviet socialist economy has been rising upward, and in the Soviet state there exists an unprecedented high tide in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life, and the continuous growth of the material welfare of the laborers.

Capitalism is becoming more and more entangled in unsolvable contradictions. The capitalist world has encountered a dead end and can only find a way out on the socialist road.

　　资本主义国家经济危机的增长
    Ｓ·维高得斯基  李何  译
    莫斯科航讯：三月三十一日联共中央宣传鼓动部机关报《文化与生活》，发表Ｓ·维高得斯基作的《资本主义国家经济危机的增长》一文，详细分析了资本主义国家当前的经济危机。全文如下：
    无论资产阶级经济学家什么样的诡计，无论帝国主义头子什么样的符咒，都不能够掩盖一个改变不了的事实：资本主义国家愈来愈深地陷在新的经济危机中。
    这次危机是在资本主义总危机进一步加深的条件下，是在帝国主义阵营削弱和民主阵营不断加强的条件下，发展着的，这时苏联的国力增长着，人民民主国家巩固着，这时资本主义国家内的工人运动和民主运动，殖民地和附属国内的民族解放运动，增长和扩大着。
    某些资产阶级经济学家安慰自己说：现在的危机是一九二○年到一九二一年危机的再演，仿佛它们两个都直接是战后危机，这种安慰是徒劳的。这里有本质的不同。一九二○年到一九二一年的危机，是在资本主义暂时稳定时机成熟了的条件下发展的，而现在的危机是在资本主义稳定老早已经崩溃的条件下发展的。第二次世界大战后，发生了一些新的国家之脱离帝国主义体系，资本主义愈来愈狭窄，它的内外矛盾日益尖锐与加深，世界舞台上的力量对比改变了，而且继续改变得不利于资本主义而有利于社会主义。
    资本主义制度的腐朽和破产，从来也没有像现在暴露得这样显明，社会主义经济制度的优越性，从来也没有像现在表现得这样清楚。
    苏联，曾经在击溃德国法西斯主义和日本帝国主义中负了一切重担，顺利地解决了恢复自己的国民经济的任务，和取得了社会主义经济进一步的强盛。苏联的工业，在一九四九年第四季，已经超过战前一九四○年百分之五十三，超过一九二九年水平九倍。
    在美国，它的领土没有遇过敌人，而且它在第二次世界大战中比之在第一次大战中，发了更多的财，但一九四九年的工业品的产量只不过高过一九二九年水平百分之四十二·一。同时，从一九四八年秋季起，在美国开始了工业生产的不断下跌。杜鲁门小心地企图使美国人相信：“现在，在上帝保佑下，我们自由的国家繁荣着”。把危机说成繁荣，不足以克服危机。在美国和其他资本主义国家发生的工业生产的下跌，不是别的，就是新的经济危机，其原因就在资本主义经济制度身上。
              ★       ★         ★
    新的经济危机的特征，在资本主义的主要国家——美国，表现得最为明显。美国的工业生产水平，从一九四三年十月到一九四九年十月，降低了百分之二十二。联合国秘书处在一九四九年世界经济状况的报告中所发表的材料，说明危机也在其他资本主义国家增长着。例如：一九四九年第三季的工业生产品的指数，比同年第二季降低了：挪威降低了百分之十六·八，法国降低了百分之十三·六，比利时降低了百分之九·四。在同一时期中，澳大利亚的生铁和含铁合金的生产降低了三分之一。编纂报告者不得不声明：美国和其他资本主义世界的国家内工业生产的下跌，和失业的增长，“过大了，不能够算做季节的现象。”
    斯大林同志在分析一九二九年危机的特点时指出了：“危机最强烈地打击了资本主义的主要国家，资本主义的养育者——美国，它在自己的手里集中着不下半数的世界各国所有的生产和消费。显然，这种情况不能不引起危机影响范围的大大扩大，引起危机的尖锐化，和引起世界资本主义意外困难的累积”（全集第十二卷，二四五页）。对于现在的危机，更可以这样说。在资本主义世界的工业中，美国分量比战前时期的增大，更加强了作为危机策源地和苗床的美国资本主义的破坏性行动，引起美国和其他资本主义国家之间，首先是美英之间，经济分歧的加深，引起整个世界帝国主义地位的削弱。
    美国垄断资本增长着的势力，财政寡头政治上层分子跟国家机器的密切结合，加强了美国的帝国主义扩张，并且产生了美国帝国主义在经济上和政治上奴役资本主义世界的其他国家的种种计划。
    美国垄断资本家替自己提出了为几乎资本主义世界的整个经济服务。他们多方力图借马歇尔计划和类似的方法把危机中的损失转嫁到其他资本主义国家的人民的肩上。马歇尔计划的实施，使得西欧各国经济愈来愈甚地受到破坏。美国帝国主义者绞杀着西欧工业的发展。法国工业经受着困难的情况：飞机工厂倒闭，汽车、纺织和其他工业部门走着下坡路。在意大利，一九四九年九月的生铁和钢的生产，为一九四八年水平的百分之六十，为一九三八年水平的百分之四十九。在比利时，煤的开采，生铁和钢的熔炼，纺织品的生产，大大降低了。帝国主义者所广为吹嘘的马歇尔计划，使得西欧各国的经济危机加速并尖锐化。
    也像在已往帝国主义时代的经济危机的时期中一样，现代的资本主义垄断，虽然生产过剩，还是疯狂地抵抗物价下跌。在美国，农业机器和装备的价格，铁和钢的价格，汽车的价值，从一九四八年九月到一九四九年九月继续上升。农产品批发价格的下跌，没有影响到零售价格。
    资本主义垄断对物价下跌的抵抗，加强着资本主义固有的紊乱性和无政府状态，引起危机的加深和延长。
    为了保持生产资料的垄断价格的高度水平而进行的竞争，阻止着固定资本的更新过程（而这是恢复和繁荣的最主要前提之一），妨碍着存货的销散，赋予危机以特别深刻、尖锐和延长的性质。在美国，在华资本的装备方面，直到第二次世界大战之前，还没有达到一九二○年水平；固定资本的更新，在危机和萧条的岁月中缩减了，而在“繁荣”的岁月中仍然是有节制的和疲惫的。在战后时期中，美国工业和运输业中新企业建设和装备的投资，一九四七年达到了最大限度，而从一九四八年起已经开始下降。而在一九四九年，这些投资已比一九四八年第四季水平低百分之二十七。
    一九四九年美国在固定资本的更新上光景如何暗淡，由一九四九年十一月五日和二十六日《商业周刊》上发表的下面事实可以看到：“在一九四九年全年中，车床的卸换比一九四五年到一九四七年的平均水平低百分之二十到四十”。其次，该周刊抱怨“金属加工工业的落后”，抱怨“装备不合乎时代的最新要求”，抱怨“延长三十年代中典型的装备的使用期限的趋向，重新出现了”。同时，该周刊指出车床输出的大大缩减。一家车床制造大公司宣布：“战前，输出为生产的百分之四十，现在为百分之十”。这样，资本家们自己不得不承认在固定资本的更新方面危机的存在。
    生产可能性的增长和市场的相对缩小之间的矛盾非常之尖锐，使大批现有的劳动手段归于无用，而且阻止着用新的劳动手段来更换它们。资本主义腐朽过程发展得这么深，使得经济危机对于大规模固定资本的更新，都不足为有效的刺激物。
    现在的经济危机是在美国帝国主义进行的空前的军备竞赛的环境中成熟的，美国帝国主义指望在新的战争中补救自己风雨飘摇的事业。美国和马歇尔化的西欧各国的经济，事实上没有离开它们在第二次世界大战的岁月中所转上的军事经济的轨道。大家知道，美国一九四七（——四八）年度到一九四九（——五○）年度。用于军备的直接费用，达五百七十四亿美元，而军费的总数达九百二十三亿美元，即等于一九四一年的三·六倍，几乎等于一九三九年的二十倍。英国军费现在耗费着两倍于一九三九年的资财。
    刺激了一九四七年到一九四八年美国的“繁荣”的军事膨胀的情况，曾经能够稍许延缓经济危机的到来。它现在也能够稍许阻碍经济危机的迅速发展，可是这种情况过去不能够，而现在也不能够防止危机，排除危机。斯大林同志在联共（布）党第十八次代表大会上指出过：资本主义经济之转上军事经济轨道，工业之片面性的，军事的方向，使资本主义国家面临着经济危机。的确，新的经济危机在美国开始了，而美国是比任何别的资本主义国家更早地把自己的经济大规模地军事化了的。
    经济危机打击着世界资本主义经济的一切方面。一九四九年世界的贸易仅为一九三七年水平的百分之九十五。美国的输出在一九四七年为一九三八年水平的百分之二五五，而在一九四八年为一九三八年水平的一九七。
    中欧和东南欧人民民主国家的产生，中华人民共和国的成立，是对于世界资本主义整个制度最有力的打击。为恶意和暴怒所冲昏的美国统治集团，对新中国实行着贸易的歧视政策，这个政策是美国统治集团在战后全部期间对苏联和人民民主国家所采取的，于它自己有极大的损失。这个政策只能够促使美国输出的进一步缩减，和资本主义国家经济危机的加深。
    由于包括整个资本主义世界的无限制的通货膨胀的结果，新的经济危机更加尖锐起来。通货膨胀是美国垄断资本手里奴役和掠夺其他资本主义国家的工具。美元购买力的下跌，和资本主义各国从美国输入的商品价格的猛涨，使这些国家贸易差额的赤字增大。例如，从美国输入的小麦价格，以美元计算，一九四八年比一九三八年高了二·八倍，牛肉价格高了四倍。
    关于第一次世界大战后资本主义国家的货币贬值，列宁写过：“这个事实说明：世界资本主义经济机构整个地瓦解。在资本主义制度下保持那种获得原料和销售成品的贸易关系，不可能继续；其所以不能继续，正是因为由于货币价值的变更，一系列国家服从于一个国家。”列宁这一原理，深刻地揭露了腐蚀着资本主义世界的矛盾。
    在为稳定货币而斗争的假面具下，美国强迫了英镑及其他货币贬值，从中取得巨大的利益。由于贬值，美国垄断资本得以对在英国的、法国的及其他的殖民地购买的原料，规定最低的价格。同时，英镑贬值，是华尔街使英镑最后从服于美元的企图。西欧各国货币的贬值，以及美元购买力的下跌，是资本主义国家内增长着的经济危机的反映，它本身又促使经济危机进一步加深和复杂化。
    资本主义世界的任何一国，现在都没有稳定的货币，通货膨胀到处肆虐。只有在苏联有结实的、稳定的货币。这反映着苏维埃社会主义经济的力量及其不断的增长。
          ★            ★            ★
    新的经济危机带给资本主义国家的劳动者以新的数不尽的灾害，生活水平的进一步降低，大批失业和贫穷的增长。斯大林同志一九三三年一月在第一次五年计划的总结报告中说过：“请看资本主义国家吧，在那里因为失业造成什么样子的恐怖。这些国家现在有不下三四千万个失业者。这是些什么人呢？普通都说这是一些‘走头无路的人’哩。”斯大林同志指出过：失业不但使失业者受难，而且因为大量失业者的存在，对于有工作的工人形成了他们在生产中地位的不稳，对明天失掉信心。
    一九二九年到一九三三年的经济危机，是资本主义社会所曾有的最深的一次经济危机，当时，主要的资本主义国家的工业下降到了最低点，在这个时期中，失业者不下三四千万人。现在，在新的经济危机增长的过程中，资本主义国家失业者和半失业者数目已不下四千五百万人。
    甚至资产阶级统计学者的官方材料，也不能够掩盖一件事实，即：一九四九年美国完全失业者的数目增加了百分之九四·五，而部分失业者数目增加了百分之一一一（与一九四八年的比较。——译者注）。一九四九年九月份比一九四八年同月，比利时失业者数目增加了两倍多，法国——二·六倍，西德——两倍多，芬兰——四·二倍，澳大利亚——约两倍，日本——一·六倍。
    在资本主义国家，工人的工资和农民的收入不断地缩减，同时，日用必需品价格则猛烈地增长。在美国从事工业的工人的实际工资，一九四八年末比一九三九年降低百分之二○·九。从一九四八年十月到一九四九年九月，在美国，采煤工业工资降低百分之二十到三一·五，制铁工业工资降低百分之六·二，制钢工业工资减低百分之一四·八，铸钢工业工资降低百分之十四。一九四九年美国农民的收入减少了四十七亿美元。
    欧洲资本主义国家的情况还要坏。例如法国，从它解放起到一九四七年底止的时期中，跟一九三八危机年比较，工资降低了百分之四十五。同一个时期，垄断资本的利润增加了十五倍！在法国和在其他资本主义国家一样，一九四八年和一九四九年的生活费继续增长，同时实际工资则继续更加降低。根据世界经济状况报告的材料，一九四九年第二季法国的生活费比一九四八年同期增加了百分之五十六，日本的生活费增加了百分之四十七，等等。
    失业和贫穷在一端的增长，随着而来的是美国垄断资本家奇谈式的利润的增长。一九四九年第三季，当着甚至依照官方材料，美国失业者数目比之一九四八年第三季倍增的时候，“通用汽车公司”利润增加了百分之六六，即一亿九千九百万美元。同一时期内，“西屋”公司的利润增加了百分之一○九，克莱斯勒利润增加了百分之八五，杜邦利润增加了百分之二六。
    由于通货膨胀而加厉的垄断资本的压迫，以准备新的世界大战为目的的，巨大的和愈来愈增长的，由统治阶级转嫁到劳动群众肩上的捐税重担，反动派对于工人阶级切身利益的进攻，资产阶级性民主的最后残余的取消，法西斯主义的复活，最后，战争的准备，——这便是美国帝国主义及其西欧伙伴们的内外政策的基本因素。
    帝国主义者们在煽动新的世界大战的道路上，在新的奴役人民的道路上，寻找经济危机的出路。然而强大的，已经组织起来的，拥护和平者的阵线在增长和扩大着，这个阵线堵塞着新的世界大战的道路，使帝国主义者们的侵略计划破产。帝国主义者们企图把危机的重负转加到劳动者肩上。可是它们遇到了从资本主义国家的工人阶级和其他一切劳动阶层方面来的愈来愈坚决的抵抗。在共产党的领导下，劳动者进行着为自己的权利和利益，为提高自己的生活水平，为面包、和平和自由的斗争。在意大利和法国和其他资本主义国家展开的罢工运动，明确地证实了资本主义国家内社会矛盾的尖锐化。
    资本主义体系统不论在中枢或是外围，不论在宗主国或是殖民地，都崩坏了。如果说第一次世界大战的结果，俄国脱离了资本主义体系，那么，第二次世界大战使得欧亚一系列国家脱离了帝国主义体系。在这样的条件下，帝国主义者们愈来愈难耍手段，愈难找到危机的出路。资本主义国家的广大劳动群众愈来愈深刻地觉悟到：只有一条道路——社会主义道路，能够使人类摆脱开战争、贫穷、饥饿。
    苏维埃社会主义经济制度的活生生的力量，每天都有新的证明。这力量明确地表现在顺利地实现战后斯大林五年计划上，表现在苏联经济的不断增长上，表现在空前规模的资本增大上（对经济部门投资的增大——译者注），表现在新技术的猛烈发展上，只有社会主义制度才没有危机、失业和贫穷。苏维埃国民经济的高涨，保证着用在有利于劳动者上的苏联国民收入的增长。工人实际工资和农民收入的增长，一九四七年到一九五○年中日用必需品价格的三次减低，是苏维埃人民物质福利和文化水平不断地高涨的明显表现。
    当着资本主义经济一直向下滚，当着在资本主义国家内经济危机增长着，失业、贫穷、饥饿盘据着的时候，苏维埃社会主义经济一直向上升，在苏维埃国家内存在着政治、经济和文化生活一切方面空前的高涨，劳动者物质福利的不停增长。
    资本主义愈来愈纠缠在不可解决的矛盾中。资本主义世界碰到了绝路，只能在社会主义道路上寻找出路。
