　　Why My Work Was Not Done Well
　　Li Chenglin, Secretary of the First District Committee of the CCP Zhangwu District, Liaoxi
　　After studying the documents of Comrades Stalin and Mao Zedong on self-criticism, I conducted a review of my work style and discovered many errors and shortcomings:

　　First, I did not study and discuss the instructions issued by the higher authorities sufficiently, and I rarely considered the specific circumstances of this district. As a result, my work arrangements were not specific enough, and the implementation of policies was not thorough. For example, in preparing for spring plowing, the county committee instructed the district committee to go deep into the difficult groups or households with no labor, livestock, or insufficient grain to help them solve specific problems. However, after accepting this task, I convened the district committee meeting without any preparation. After a simple discussion, I convened a meeting of district and village cadres, first asking them to report on the situation, and then making a plan was considered complete. I failed to analyze and study according to the specific circumstances of this district, distinguish the priorities, and solve various difficulties. Therefore, the four plans made in preparation for spring plowing were not completed. For another example, when the county committee instructed our district committee to discuss the provincial government's "Construction Plan for Dike Repair" and the "Military Dependent Land Plowing Draft," I believed that our district was doing well and there were no problems, so I did not check my work according to the spirit of the documents, let alone implement them specifically. Later, when I inspected the villages, I found many problems: the method of dike repair was not uniform throughout the district; some villages used land, and some used labor and livestock. The masses agreed to contribute labor according to the land, but many cadres were still afraid of trouble and continued to contribute labor. In the work of plowing for military dependents, there were also many deviations. For example, some only contracted for plowing but not for grain, and no contracts were signed. Therefore, the contracting households only busied themselves with their own land and did not care about the land of the dependents. Secondly, I did not pay attention to implementing the regulations on protecting forests. Although I discovered that landlords and rich peasants in Fuxingdi Village were cutting public trees, I did not punish them, and the masses followed suit, causing damage to the forests. The above shortcomings all show that I did not seriously study and implement the instructions of the higher authorities and government decrees in the past, which caused considerable losses to the work.

　　Secondly, my democratic style was insufficient, and I did not implement the Party committee system well. At the same time, my work was not in-depth and superficial. Every time I held a district committee meeting, I did not prepare or plan in advance, nor did I let everyone deliberate. At the meeting, everyone talked about some fragmentary things, failing to grasp the center, wasting a lot of time. In the end, I just talked about the work and considered it done. But I felt good about myself. The county committee issued instructions to "strengthen the leadership of preparatory plowing." After reading it once, I could not come up with new problems, so I just read it to everyone at the district committee meeting as a general letter. In my work, I failed to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, after understanding a few households in difficulty in the villages, I heard village cadres and the masses say that they were good-for-nothings or lazy people, and I did not conduct further investigation and research, so I thought it was unnecessary to help them solve their problems. Sometimes I understood some households in difficulty, but I did not personally help solve the problems, and I left them to the village cadres and left. My work had no focus. For example, regarding the issue of mutual aid teams, the county committee repeatedly instructed us to cultivate typical examples, but we only conducted general appeals and did not provide specific leadership. Until now, we have not led a single team well.

　　I only criticized the district and village cadres and Party members more and praised them less. The discovery and resolution of problems were not timely, so the bad tendencies among the cadres continued to develop. District cadre Chen Yu embezzled and then broke away from the revolution; district youth cadre Fang Yaochen drank with village cadres and did not work after arriving in the village. Bai Shuqi, who managed the warehouse, was irresponsible, resulting in the spoilage of more than one hundred catties of wheat flour. The Party members of Fuxingdi Village only cared about gambling, and did not report the cutting of trees by landlords and rich peasants.

　　After studying the documents of Comrades Stalin and Mao Zedong on self-criticism this time, I am determined to overcome these shortcomings in future work. First of all, I must study the instructions of the higher authorities well, thoroughly implement the policies and grasp the work situation, go deep into the groups and households to understand the problems, discover problems and solve them in a timely manner. Problems related to policies must be brought to the district committee for research and discussion. Before the district committee meeting, I must be fully prepared. The discussion at the meeting should grasp the center and distinguish the priorities to solve the problems. When implementing policies, if there are unclear points, I must ask the higher authorities for instructions and strengthen contact with the higher authorities. In my work, I must be careful and diligent, accept the criticism of the higher authorities and comrades, listen to the opinions of the masses, and truly be a loyal servant of the people.

### 我的工作为什么没有作好

　　我的工作为什么没有作好
    中共辽西彰武一区区委书记  李成林
    我在学习了斯大林、毛泽东同志论自我批评的文件后，对自己的工作作风作了一次检查，发现了许多错误和缺点：
    首先对上级发布的指示文件研究讨论不够，对本区具体情况也很少考虑，因之布置工作不具体，贯彻政策不彻底。如在准备春耕工作中，县委布置区委要深入到无劳力、畜力和缺粮食的困难的小组或户里去，帮助他们解决具体问题。但我接受了这个任务后，毫无准备地召开了区委会，经过简单的讨论之后，就召开区、村干部会，先叫他们汇报了一下情况，然后订个计划就算完事。我未能根据本区具体情况，加以分析研究，分别轻重缓急，解决各种困难。因此，准备春耕中订的四次计划都没完成。又如，县委指示我们区委讨论省府的“关于修堤施工方案”和“军属包耕草案”两文件时，我却自认为我区执行的不错，没有什么问题，就没依据文件的精神检查自己的工作，更未具体贯彻执行。后来到村里检查时，才发现问题很多；修堤出工办法全区不统一，有的村按土地，有的村按人力、畜力。群众同意按地出工，而不少干部因怕麻烦仍按劳力出工。军属代耕工作中，也有不少偏差。如有的包耕不包粮，未订合同，因此包工户只忙自己的地，不顾代耕户的地。其次对保护林木法令也未注意贯彻。虽然发现了福兴地村地主富农砍公共树，但未加以制裁，群众也就随着砍伐起来，使林木遭到了破坏。上述缺点都说明我过去没有认真研究并贯彻执行上级的指示和政府法令，因而使工作受到不少损失。
    其次，民主作风不够，没有很好的贯彻党委制。同时工作又不深入，浮皮了草，每次开区委会，我事先不作准备和计划，也未让大家酝酿。会上你一言我一语，扯些零碎事情，抓不住中心，浪费了不少时间，而在最后我把工作说一下就算完了。但自己却还感到不错。县委发下来的“加强备耕领导”指示，我看完一遍后，提不出新问题，拿到区委会上当一般信给大家念一遍就完事。工作上未能作到及时发现问题、解决问题，如到村里了解了几户困难户后，听到村干部和群众反映说他们是二流子或懒汉，我再未作进一步的调查研究，就认为不必去帮助解决了。有时了解了一些困难户，但自己也没亲自帮助解决问题，推在村干部身上就走了。工作无重点，如关于互助组的问题，县委屡次指示要培养典型，但我们仍只是进行一般的号召，没有具体领导，直到现在也没领导好一个组。
    对区、村干部、党员也只是批评多，表扬少，发现与解决问题都不及时，因而干部中的不良倾向得以继续发展。区干部陈玉贪污后脱离了革命；区青年干事方耀臣到村后却和村干部喝酒不做工作。管理仓库的白戍启，不负责任，因而霉烂了一百多斤小麦面。福兴地村党员只顾赌博，地主富农砍了树林也不报告。
    这次学习了斯大林、毛泽东同志论自我批评的文件后，我下定决心在今后工作中去克服这些缺点。首先要很好学习上级指示，很好贯彻政策与掌握工作情况，深入到组、户里去了解问题，发现问题并及时解决。有关政策的问题，一定拿到区委会上研究讨论。区委会开会前要有充分准备，会上讨论要抓住中心，分出轻重缓急解决问题。执行政策时有不明确的地方要向上级请示，加强与上级的联系。工作中要细心钻研，接受上级与同志们的批评，倾听群众意见，真正作个人民的忠实勤务员。
