　　Launching the Model Locomotive Team Movement

    The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has decided to launch a model locomotive team competition movement in the Northern and Southern Railway Administrations, and has announced the implementation measures. This is a measure of great significance for the current railway construction undertaking of the people.
    Previously, the Northeast Railway Administrations launched the "Iron Ox Movement" and achieved great results. In this movement, workers actively implemented the responsibility system, cared for locomotives, and maintained normal standards for water supply and refueling; they regularly checked and maintained the good condition of locomotives, improved locomotive quality, ensured safe operation, and extended the period between major inspections. Workers learned new operating methods for locomotives, as well as the "three-shovel system" for coal loading, saving coal consumption and reducing costs. This movement is continuing in the Northeast.
    The model locomotive team competition movement decided by the Ministry of Railways this time summarizes the experience of the Northeast Railway Administrations in carrying out the Iron Ox Movement for the past year, and is proposed after studying the specific conditions within the customs (Guannei - i.e. the rest of China). Its purpose is to comprehensively implement the responsibility system, improve locomotive quality, reduce costs, create new quotas, and safely complete and exceed the state's transportation tasks. Its steps are: starting from the locomotive department, gradually popularizing to the traffic, engineering, electrical, inspection, and factory affairs departments. The promulgation of this decision will undoubtedly be supported by all railway workers, and will set off a new upsurge of labor competition in the people's railway transportation business.
    The model locomotive team competition movement is very different from past temporary or seasonal crash competition movements. First, it is a lasting revolutionary competition, which has many advantages over short-term competitions. In the past, short-term competitions often had biases such as emphasizing quantity over quality, simply increasing labor intensity while ignoring the intelligence of workers; when the supply of raw materials was uncoordinated, it even caused production shutdowns. During the competition, production often increased temporarily, but after the competition ended, production declined instead. The current model locomotive team competition movement is different. It stipulates the work standards for team members, so that everyone has clear goals to strive for, implements strict technical inspections and review, approval, promotion, demotion, and other procedures, and stipulates specific rewards and punishments. Therefore, this movement can avoid some of the above shortcomings. Second, it organizes the typical locomotives that create new records, the crew teams, the maintenance teams, the advanced workers, and the winners in technical improvement and rationalization proposals in the form of "model locomotive teams," so that this movement has a core and a leading force. Staff who have achieved certain work results in this movement all have the possibility of becoming reserve members. This makes the movement more broadly based.
    At present, the conditions for carrying out the model locomotive team competition movement in the railway administrations within the customs are fully available. Because first, we have the valuable experience of the Northeast bureaus in carrying out the Iron Ox Movement for the past year, which can shorten the time for exploration. The Northeast Railway has undergone a completely new look due to the Iron Ox Movement. The same effect will surely be achieved within the customs after accepting this experience. Second, the "Mao Zedong" heroic locomotive has been spreading advanced experience, promoting the responsibility system, imparting new technologies, cultivating typical locomotives (such as the "No. 1939" locomotive in Fengtai), and driving the backward locomotives for more than a year within the customs, laying the foundation for carrying out the model locomotive team movement. Third, the responsibility system has been implemented in the Northern and Southern bureaus for a year, and considerable achievements have been made; management democratization has also been gradually realized, and the enthusiasm of workers is generally rising. The Northern and Southern Railways have only been restored for more than a year, and it is expected that after a certain period of effort, good results will be produced.
    How to carry out this movement at present? First of all, extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization work should be carried out among railway workers, and the implementation measures stipulated by the Ministry of Railways should be explained in detail to give full play to the enthusiasm of the workers and strive to become model locomotive team members. Secondly, units with better conditions should be selected as key demonstrations, and after experience is gained, they should be fully promoted to combine general calls with individual and specific guidance. Thirdly, administratively, we should strengthen the planning of production, solve production difficulties in a timely manner, approve and reward in a timely manner, encourage activists, and regularly announce production results. The Party, the League, and the trade union should go deep into workshops and groups to help them hold good production meetings, help each worker formulate plans, and regularly check the degree of implementation of the plans. Fourthly, we must strengthen technical learning, learn new locomotive operating methods, new firing methods, thoroughly implement the three-shovel system; mobilize workers to use their brains and promote rationalization proposals. In this way, the movement can be consolidated and sustained, and develop in a higher direction. The most important thing is to strengthen the class education of workers, improve their awareness, and make this movement advance steadily on the basis of broad mass consciousness.

### 开展模范机车队运动

　　开展模范机车队运动
    中央人民政府铁道部决定在北方及南方各铁路管理局开展模范机车队竞赛运动，并公布了实施办法。这是目前人民铁路建设事业上有重大意义的措施。
    前此，东北各铁路管理局曾开展“铁牛运动”，收到很大成绩。在这个运动中，工人积极实行了负责制，关心机车，保持给水、加油的正常标准；经常检查与保持机车的良好状态，提高机车质量，使之安全行驶，延长甲检。工人们学会了对机车的新操纵法，也学会了“三锨制”的加煤方法，节省了用煤量，降低了成本。这个运动，在东北正继续开展。
    此次铁道部决定开展的模范机车队竞赛运动就是总结了东北各铁路管理局一年来开展铁牛运动的经验，研究了关内的具体情况而提出的。它的目的是：全面贯彻负责制，提高机车质量，减低成本，创造新的定额，安全完成与超过国家的运输任务。它的步骤是：从机务部门开始，逐渐普及到车务、工务、电务、检车和厂务方面去。这一决定的颁布，无疑地将会得到全体铁路工人的拥护，将会在人民铁路的运输事业上掀起劳动竞赛的新高潮。
    模范机车队竞赛运动与过去临时性或季节性的突击竞赛运动有很大区别。第一，它是一种持久性的革命竞赛，比短期的竞赛有许多优越的地方。过去短期的竞赛，往往发生重量不重质、单纯地增加劳动强度而忽略了发挥工人的智慧等偏向；在原料和材料供给不协调时，甚至会引起生产停顿的现象。在竞赛期间，往往使生产暂时提高，但在竞赛结束之后，生产反而下降。现在的模范机车队竞赛运动则不同。它规定了队员的工作标准，使人人都有明确的奋斗目标，实行严格的技术检查和审查、批准、升级、降级等手续，并规定了具体的奖励和处分办法。因此，这个运动就可以避免上述的一些缺点。第二，它把创造新纪录的典型机车、包乘组、包修组、先进工人及在技术改进和合理化建议中的获奖者，用“模范机车队”的形式组织起来，使这一运动有了核心和带头的力量。在这个运动中有一定的工作成绩的工作人员，都有成为预备队员的可能。这就使运动更加有了广泛的群众基础。
    目前，在关内各铁路管理局开展模范机车队竞赛运动的条件是充分具备的。因为第一，我们有东北各局一年来开展铁牛运动的宝贵经验，可以缩短摸索的时间。东北铁路由于开展了铁牛运动，使整个铁路建设的面貌焕然一新。关内接受这一经验后一定也会收到同等的效果。第二，“毛泽东号”英雄机车在关内一年多的时间，传播了先进的经验，推广了负责制，传授了新的技术，培养了典型机车（像丰台的“一九三九号”机车），并带动了落后的机车，为开展模范机车队运动打下了基础。第三，北方和南方各局负责制已推行了一年，获得不少的成绩；管理民主化也逐步实现，工人的劳动热忱正在普遍高涨。北方和南方铁路才恢复了一年多，预计再经过一定时间的努力，将会产生良好的成果。
    目前怎样开展这一运动呢？首先应在铁路工人中进行广泛深入的宣传动员工作，详细解释铁道部所规定的实施办法，发挥工人群众的积极性，争取作模范机车队员。其次，要选择条件较好的单位作重点示范，俟取得经验后，再加以全面推广，使一般号召与个别的具体指导相结合。第三，行政上要加强生产计划性，及时解决生产上的困难，及时地批准、奖励，鼓励积极分子，定期公布生产成绩。党、团、工会应深入车间、小组，帮助他们开好生产会议，帮助每个工人订出计划，并经常检查计划执行的程度。第四，要加强技术学习，学会新的机车操纵法、新的焚火法、彻底实行三锨制；发动工人开动脑筋，提倡合理化建议。这样，才能使运动巩固持久，向着更高的方向发展。最重要的是要加强工人的阶级教育，提高其觉悟程度，使这一运动在广泛的群众自觉的基础上稳步前进。
