　　Wang Fuzhi, Deputy Company Commander of a Certain Unit of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district
    Violently Beat a Woman and Forced Her to Divorce
    The Party Committee of the Military Sub-district Has Already Disciplined Him
    Wang Fuzhi (Communist Party member), Deputy Company Commander of a certain unit of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district, forced a woman, Fan Zangni, to divorce and assisted backward parents in torturing Fan Zangni by suspending and beating her, seriously violating the laws and policies of the Party and the People's Government guaranteeing freedom of marriage. The Party Committee of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district has given him a warning as a disciplinary action.

    Fan Zangni is from Dongguan, Luancheng, and is nineteen years old this year. She and her neighbor, Zhang Changyuan (twenty-one years old, currently a member of the Luancheng Public Security Team), have a good relationship, and both want to get married. However, Zangni's parents did not allow them to marry. In February and March of this year, Zangni again proposed to her parents that she wanted to marry Changyuan, but her father still refused, beat her several times, and busied himself with finding a husband for her. Zangni insisted on her right to choose her own marriage and personally went to the village women's association director and village head Zhao Fu, and village branch secretary Song Erchou, asking them to help her solve her marriage problem. The women's association director and the village head went to Zangni's father, Fan Zhicai, explained the marriage policy of the People's Government to him, and persuaded him to agree to Zangni marrying Changyuan. At first, Fan Zhicai was unwilling, but later he reluctantly agreed. On March 26th, Changyuan and Zangni officially registered their marriage with the government, and the young couple lived a very happy life.

    Zangni's older brother, Fan Liandong, was a soldier in a certain unit of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district. After learning about this, he felt that Changyuan and the village cadres had bullied his family. Wang Fuzhi, the deputy company commander of the unit, also believed that this was an issue of insulting a military family member. On March 29th, he took three soldiers and Fan Liandong to the Fan family. At this time, Zangni was at her husband's home. Wang Fuzhi then asked Fan Zhicai to call Zangni back. After Zangni returned, Wang Fuzhi persuaded her to divorce Changyuan. Zangni said, "Marriage should be free, and I am willing to marry Changyuan." Wang Fuzhi became angry and said to Fan Zhicai, "You should use family law." So Fan Zhicai tied Zangni up and hung her from the beam. Wang Fuzhi also ordered the three soldiers he brought to stand guard on the roof and at the door to prevent anyone from coming. Wang Fuzhi wanted Zangni to take out her marriage certificate. Zangni refused. Her brother, Liandong, then hit her with the butt of a gun. When Zangni cried out in pain, her father covered her mouth with a towel until Zangni fainted. Wang Fuzhi, fearing for her life, untied Zangni, searched her pockets, and tore up the marriage certificate. While they were beating Zangni, her mother was heartbroken and dared not say anything, secretly sending a message. Village head Zhao Fu and militia captain Rong Xixiang learned about this and went to the Fan family. However, they were blocked by the guards twice. Zangni's mother made cornmeal mush for Wang Fuzhi and the others. She scooped a bowl for Zangni to eat, but Wang Fuzhi said, "Should such a daughter still be allowed to eat!" Her mother was so frightened that she quickly took the food back. Finally, Wang Fuzhi felt that the matter was almost done and returned triumphantly.

    After Wang Fuzhi left, Fan Liandong and his father locked Zangni at home and continued to force Zangni to divorce Changyuan. Zangni had no choice but to pretend to agree to divorce Changyuan and went with her father to the Luancheng County People's Court to complete the procedures. When they arrived at the court, Zangni told the facts and insisted on the principle of freedom of marriage. After a detailed interrogation, the Luancheng County People's Court determined that the marriage between Fan Zangni and Zhang Changyuan was legal; Fan Zhicai restricted his daughter's freedom of marriage and used torture to beat her, and should be temporarily detained and educated. Wang Fuzhi expressed his dissatisfaction when he heard that the government had ruled Fan Zangni's marriage valid.

    After learning about this incident, the Party Committee of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district, in order to rectify military and party discipline, gave Wang Fuzhi a public warning within the Party and a warning outside the Party, and reported the facts and the handling of the matter to the entire army.

　　石家庄军分区某部副连长王福芝
    吊打妇女强迫离婚 
    该军分区党委会已予处分
    石家庄军分区某部副连长王福芝（中共党员）强迫妇女范赃妮离婚，并协助落后家长，将范赃妮非刑吊打，严重违犯了党和人民政府保障婚姻自由的法令和政策。石家庄军分区党委会已给以警告处分。
    范赃妮是栾城东关人，今年十九岁。她和邻居张昌元（二十一岁，现为栾城公安队队员）感情很好，双方都有结婚的要求。但赃妮的父母不允许他们俩人结婚。今年二、三月间，赃妮又向他父母提出要和昌元结婚，她父亲还是不许，把她打了几顿，并忙着给她找婆家。赃妮坚持要求婚姻自主，亲自去找村妇会主任和村长赵福、村支部书记宋二丑，要求帮助她解决婚姻问题。妇女会主任和村长等便去找赃妮的父亲范志彩，向他解释人民政府的婚姻政策，劝他同意赃妮和昌元结婚。范志彩起先还是不肯，后来就勉强同意了。三月二十六日，昌元和赃妮就向政府正式登记结了婚，小俩口的生活挺美满。
    赃妮的哥哥范连东，在石家庄军分区某部当战士，知道这事后，便认为是昌元和村干部欺侮他家。该部副连长王福芝，也认为这是一个侮辱军属问题，便在三月二十九日带了三个战士，和范连东到范家。这时赃妮在婆家。王福芝便叫范志彩把赃妮叫回来。赃妮回来后，王福芝便劝她和昌元离婚。赃妮说：“婚姻要自主，我愿意和昌元结婚。”王福芝恼羞成怒，便和范志彩说：“你们动家法吧。”于是范志彩便把赃妮绑起，吊在梁上。王福芝并叫他所带来的三个战士到房上、门口站岗，以防有人来。王福芝要赃妮拿出结婚证来。赃妮不给。她哥哥连东便用枪托打她。赃妮嚷痛时，她父亲便用手巾堵住她的嘴，直到赃妮昏迷过去。王福芝怕出人命，才把赃妮解下来，从她衣袋里搜出结婚证扯掉了。在他们吊打赃妮时，她母亲心痛不敢说，偷着传出信去。村长赵福、民兵中队长荣喜祥知道了，便到范家去。但去了二次，都被门岗挡了回去。赃妮的母亲给王福芝等做杂面。她盛了一碗要给赃妮吃，王福芝便说：“这样的闺女，还让她吃饭！”吓的她娘把饭赶紧端回。最后，王福芝觉得事情办得差不多了，便得意洋洋地回去了。
    王福芝走后，范连东与其父把赃妮锁在家里，继续强迫赃妮和昌元离婚。赃妮没有办法，便假装应允和昌元离婚，和她父亲同到栾城县人民法院去办手续。到了法院，赃妮便说出事实经过，并坚持婚姻自主原则。栾城县人民法院经过详细审讯，认为范赃妮与张昌元的婚姻是合法的；范志彩限制女儿婚姻自主，并用非刑吊打，应予暂时扣押、给予教育。王福芝听说政府判决范赃妮婚姻有效，还表示不满。
    石家庄军分区党委会知道这件事情之后，为整饬军纪、党纪，给王福芝以党内当众警告、党外警告的处分，并把事实经过及处理情形通报全军。
