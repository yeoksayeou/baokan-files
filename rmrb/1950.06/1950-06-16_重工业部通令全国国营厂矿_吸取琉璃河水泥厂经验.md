　　Ministry of Heavy Industry Issues Circular to National State-Owned Factories and Mines:
    Learn from the Experience of the Liulihe Cement Plant
    [Our Newspaper News] The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government issued a circular on June 13th to the heavy industry bureaus, factories, and mines of major administrative regions across the country, requiring them to remember the lessons of the Liulihe Cement Plant and its experience in production transformation, and use it as a reference for improving their work.

    The circular pointed out: The transformation of a factory is inextricably linked to the transformation of the company (or bureau) that leads the factory (or mine) in production. Similarly, when a factory or mine experiences serious problems, it is inseparable from the bureaucracy of the factory's direct leading agency. The relationship between the North China Ceramics Company and the Liulihe Cement Plant illustrates this point. When the situation at the Liulihe Cement Plant became serious, the North China Ceramics Company was criticized by the Ministry of Heavy Industry. Under the supervision and assistance of the Ministry, the company underwent significant changes and did its work well, and should be commended along with the plant's workers.

    The circular continued: The Liulihe Cement Plant is a relatively prominent example, which easily attracts the attention of various levels. At present, there are also many problems in the general work of heavy industrial factories and mines in various places, which are often easily overlooked and disregarded by leading cadres. Therefore, in addition to paying attention to factories with prominent problems, the work of improving general factories and mines should not be ignored, otherwise serious situations may also occur. The leading heavy industry agencies in major administrative regions, in addition to carrying out general guidance work, should regularly provide practical assistance to various factories and mines, grasp typical examples to promote others, and cooperate with the leadership of policies and principles.

　　重工业部通令全国国营厂矿
    吸取琉璃河水泥厂经验
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部于六月十三日向全国各大行政区重工业部局、厂、矿发布通令，要求记取琉璃河水泥厂的教训及其生产转变的经验，做为改进工作的参考。
    通令指出：工厂转变与领导厂（或矿）生产之公司（或局）的转变有不可分的关系。同样，厂或矿发生了严重问题，与厂之直接领导机关的官僚主义是分不开的。此次华北窑业公司与琉璃河水泥厂的关系，正是说明这个问题。琉璃河水泥厂情况发展严重时，华北窑业公司曾受到重工业部批评。在本部督促与帮助下，该公司有了很大转变，把工作做好，亦应与该厂职工同受到表扬。
    通令继指出：琉璃河水泥厂较为突出之典型，易引起各级间注意。目前各地重工业厂矿中，一般工作中亦存在不少问题，往往容易被领导干部所忽略与漠视。因此，除对问题突出的工厂应加以注意外，对一般厂矿的改进工作，亦不容忽视，否则亦会发生严重情况。各大行政区重工业领导机关，除进行一般指导工作外，应经常给予各厂矿以实际帮助，抓住典型推动其他，以配合政策原则的领导。
