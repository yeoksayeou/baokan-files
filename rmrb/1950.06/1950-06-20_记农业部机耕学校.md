　　Record of the Ministry of Agriculture's Agricultural Mechanization School
　　By Our Correspondent Bai Sheng
    Editor's Note: The Agricultural Mechanization School was developed on the basis of the former North China People's Government Tractor Training Class. Before the liberation of Beijing, a tractor training class was held at the Ji'nan Jiheng Farm, with more than 70 students, who graduated in March 1949. It was later taken over by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. In December of last year, another tractor training class was opened at Shuangqiao Farm in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, training more than 500 staff members from national mechanized farms. After graduating in March of this year, they have gone to various farms to carry out mechanized farming work. On April 1, the tractor training class was officially changed into a formal agricultural mechanization school. In addition, the repair factory originally belonging to the Shuangqiao Tractor Training Class has also been expanded and officially became the state-owned farm supply station directly under the Ministry of Agriculture in mid-March of this year, responsible for transferring Soviet agricultural machinery to various state-owned farms for use. This newsletter can help readers understand the outline of this new type of school.

    More than thirty miles east of Beijing, near Shuangqiao Railway Station, a field of golden wheat and tender green cotton seedlings surrounds the recently established Agricultural Mechanization School of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government—the first new type of school to train Chinese workers, peasants, youth, and intellectuals to become agricultural mechanization talents.
    Here, more than 80 percent of the 317 students are young men and women of worker-peasant origin (32 female students in total) (the others are junior high school, high school, or university students). Some of them have lived a fighting life in the revolutionary ranks since they were young, some grew up working in the fields, and some have operated machines in factories or mined coal in mines. Most of them were recommended to the Ministry of Agriculture by various agencies, organizations, and troops and were admitted after a simple examination and physical examination. The school has 13 teachers, who teach general science knowledge, agricultural machinery, agricultural knowledge, and political classes.
    At the end of March, when they first arrived at the school, it was the time when a large number of Soviet agricultural machines and farm implements were shipped to our country. This is the first batch of agricultural construction materials China ordered from the Soviet Union. How exciting! They all ran to Shuangqiao Railway Station to welcome this batch of new machines. They used their own hands to move more than 10,000 tons of steel machinery loaded on more than 500 train carriages from the train, and it was spread for half a mile at Shuangqiao Railway Station. There are brand-new tractors of various types, combine harvesters, threshers, seed selectors, seeders, manure spreaders, as well as disc harrows, tooth harrows, plowshares, and so on. If you understand the mood of a soldier getting a good gun or a worker getting a good tool, then you can also understand their mood when they see these brand-new agricultural machines.
    In early April, they began their studies. These young people of worker-peasant origin have never had the opportunity to come into contact with general scientific knowledge in the past. Therefore, when they studied general scientific knowledge such as physics, chemistry, botany, and arithmetic in the first month, they felt it was more difficult than any work they had done in the past. But they are not afraid of difficulties. They are studying hard, not wasting a single minute or second of study time. They adopted the methods of self-study and tutoring, joint research, and established study mutual aid groups. With the help of some students from intellectual backgrounds with higher educational levels, they made rapid progress, and everyone improved their confidence in learning. When they learned about the principles and structure of tractors, they felt even more happy and interested.
    The school's education combines theory with practice, and it emphasizes both machinery and agriculture. The study period for students in school is currently set at six months. After the end, they will be assigned to various state-owned farms for internships, and they will be allowed to graduate after half a year. The learning process in the first month focuses on strengthening the labor viewpoint and political study, transforming thoughts, supplemented by general science knowledge learning and farm planting labor. The second to fifth months are for learning the principles, structure, performance, maintenance, and use of tractors. The sixth month is for learning to drive tractors and use various new farm implements. Not only should each person be trained to become an excellent tractor driver, but also each person should learn to cultivate. Therefore, in their study courses, there are not only agricultural machinery but also agricultural knowledge. In addition, there are three afternoons a week to participate in field labor on the practice farm. When they learn about the principles, structure, and performance of tractors, the teachers first explain it, and then immediately let the students see the real objects. When teaching agricultural knowledge, it is also coordinated with field labor. Their entire study is integrated with practice. The 2,400-mu practice farm has cotton fields, wheat fields, orchards, vegetable gardens, and livestock farms. The pasture also raises 39 dairy cows and more than 300 Leghorn chickens hatched by themselves. In addition, there is a flour mill that produces Longkou vermicelli, which is sold overseas. Any bit of book knowledge the students learn can be tested here immediately.
    On May 1st, Labor Day, they elected labor models based on labor and academic performance. Seven students were elected as labor models (in addition, three workers from the farm were also elected as labor models). The first-class female labor model, Cui Shuqin, is the daughter of a poor peasant. She grew up in a poor life. She worked as a nurse in the army and as a female worker in the Harbin Workers' Clothing Factory. She felt extremely excited when she was recommended to the Agricultural Mechanization School by the All-China Women's Federation this time. Although she felt difficult when she first started studying, after two weeks of study, due to her continuous research, hard work, and the help of her classmates, she made rapid progress. She not only works hard in her studies but also is a diligent worker in labor. Hao Xiwang, who was selected as the first-class labor model of the whole school, is only nineteen years old this year. This child, who grew up eating chaff in the countryside, started working in coal mines at the age of fourteen and joined the People's Liberation Army at the age of sixteen. Before he was admitted to the Agricultural Mechanization School, he served as a service member in this newspaper. When he first entered the school, he only scored 50 points on general scientific knowledge. He worked hard, and in the second month, he scored 95 points in the tractor principle exam, becoming one of the most outstanding students in the school. Zhang Chenglin, who entered the Agricultural Mechanization School from this newspaper with Hao Xiwang, was also selected as the third-class labor model this time. This child of a poor peasant family had been working as a short-term worker for landlords since he was a child. He had not attended school until he participated in revolutionary work, and then he learned some culture in the revolutionary ranks. When he first came to the Agricultural Mechanization School, he felt that his education level was low, and it was difficult to absorb scientific knowledge such as physics and chemistry. But after a period of hard work, he overcame these difficulties, and now he understands those common terms in physical and chemical sciences and their functions. The second-class female labor model, Dai Jialing, could not even take notes when she first arrived at the Agricultural Mechanization School. Now she can not only take notes but also has learned many, many common terms about tractors. The third-class female labor model, Zheng Sulian, a female worker in a printing factory, is also never behind in learning and labor. The spirit of hard study and active labor of each of them makes the students feel admiration.
    Currently, they are studying the courses of the tractor's engine system, fuel system, and power generation system. In terms of agricultural labor, they are enthusiastically carrying out thinning, weeding, controlling aphids, and wheat harvesting in cotton fields. In the vast campus, from morning to night, you can see groups of them walking from the classroom to the field, and from the field to the classroom, studying and working happily and intensely.

　　记农业部机耕学校
    本报记者  柏生
    编者按：机耕学校是在原华北人民政府拖拉机训练班的基础上发展起来的。北京解放前，在冀南冀衡农场开办了一期拖拉机训练班，有学员七十余人，一九四九年三月毕业。后由中央人民政府农业部接办。去年十二月在北京东郊双桥农场又开办了一期拖拉机训练班，调训全国各机耕农场工作人员五百余人。今年三月毕业后，已分赴各农场开展机耕工作。四月一日起，拖拉机训练班改成了正式的机耕学校。此外，原属双桥拖拉机训练班的修理厂，亦已扩大组织，于本年三月中正式成为农业部直接管辖的国营农场供应站，负责转运苏联的农业机器给各个国营农场使用。这篇通讯，可以帮助读者认识这个新型学校的轮廓。
    离北京东三十多里，在双桥车站附近，一片金黄色的麦田和嫩绿的棉苗，围绕着中央人民政府农业部最近创办的机耕学校——这是培养中国工农青年和知识分子成为机耕人才的第一个新型学校。
    这里，三百一十七名学生中有百分之八十以上的学生是工农出身的男女（女同学共三十二人）青年（其他是初中、高中或大学的学生）。他们有的从小就在革命队伍里过着战斗的生活，有的是在庄稼地上干活长大的，有的曾在工厂里开过机器，在矿山里挖过煤。他们这次入学，大部分是由各机关、团体以及部队介绍到农业部，经过简单考试和体格检查后录取的。全校有教员十三人，分别讲授普通科学常识、农业机械、农业常识和政治课等。
    三月底，他们刚到学校的时候，正值大批苏联农业机器和农具运到我国。这是中国向苏联订购的第一批农业建设物资。多么令人兴奋！他们大伙儿一齐跑到双桥车站去迎接这批新机器。他们用自己的手把五百余辆火车皮装运的万吨重的钢铁机器，从火车上搬运下来，在双桥车站摆满了半里地。这里有崭新的各型拖拉机、联合收割机、打麦机、选种机、播种机、撒粪机以及圆盘耙、丁齿耙、犁尖等等。谁要是了解一个战士得到一杆好枪，一个工人得到一个好家具时候的心情，那么也能了解他们看到这些崭新的农业机器时的心情。
    四月初，他们开始了学习。这些工农出身的青年，对于一般科学知识过去是没有机会接触的。因此当第一个月学习物理、化学、植物、算术等普通科学常识的时候，他们感到比自己过去作过的任何工作都难。但他们是不怕困难的。他们刻苦地学习着，不让学习时间有一分一秒的浪费。他们采取了自学辅导，共同研究的方式，建立了学习互助小组，经过一些文化程度较高的知识分子出身的同学的帮助，他们进步很快，每个人都提高了学习的信心。当他们学习拖拉机的原理和构造的时候，他们更感到愉快、有兴趣。
    学校的教育是理论与实际结合，机农并重的。学生在校学习期间目前暂定为六个月，结束后，分配到各国营农场去实习，半年后始准予毕业。学习进程，第一个月是以加强劳动观点及政治学习、改造思想为主，辅以普通科学常识学习和农场种植劳动等。第二个月到第五个月是学习拖拉机的原理、构造、性能、保养、使用等。第六个月学习驾驶拖拉机和各种新农具的使用。不仅要培养每一个人成为一个优良的拖拉机驾驶员，同时要使每一个人都学会耕种。因此在他们学习的课程中，不但有农业机械，还有农业常识，此外每星期还有三个下午参加实习农场的田间劳动。他们学拖拉机的原理、构造和性能的时候，教员先讲解一遍，马上便让同学们去看实物。讲农业常识时，也是配合田间实地劳动的。他们整个的学习都是与实际结合在一起的。二千四百亩的实习农场里，有棉田、麦田、果园、菜园及畜牧场等，在牧场中并养有奶牛三十九头及自孵的莱亨鸡三百余只，另外还设有一个粉房，出产销行海外的龙口粉，同学们所学到的任何一点书本知识，都可以立刻在这里得到实验。
    五月一日劳动节，他们选举了一次劳动模范，根据劳动与学习的成绩，有七个同学当选了劳模（另外农场中还有三个工人也当选了劳模）。头等女劳模崔淑琴是一个贫农的女儿。从小在贫苦的生活中长大。她在部队中作过护士，在哈尔滨工人被服厂作过女工。这次由全国妇联介绍到机耕学校来学习，她感到极大的兴奋。虽然刚开始学习时曾感到困难，但经过两周的学习后，由于她的不断钻研，自己苦读，和同学们的帮助讲解，她进步很快。她不仅在学习上努力，在劳动上更是一个勤快手。被选为全校头等劳模的郝西望，今年才十九岁。这个从小在农村吃糠长大的孩子，十四岁就开始到煤窑去做工，十六岁参加了解放军。他在考进机耕学校以前，曾在本报担任勤务员。他初进学校时，普通科学常识只考到五十分，他刻苦努力，第二个月考拖拉机原理时，得到了九十五分的成绩，成为全校最优秀学生中的一个。还有和郝西望一块从本报进入机耕学校的张成林，这次也被选为三等劳模。这个贫农的孩子，从小就给地主家做短工，没有读过书，直到参加革命工作后，才在革命队伍中学习了一些文化。他刚来到机耕学校的时候，感到自己文化程度低，学习物理、化学等科学常识，很难吸收进去。但是经过一段苦读后，他克服了这些困难，他现在懂得那些理化科学上普通常用的名词和它们的作用。二等女劳模戴家玲，刚到机耕学校时，连笔记也抄不上来，现在她不但能抄笔记了，而且已经学会了许多许多关于拖拉机的常用名词。三等女劳模郑素莲，一个印刷工厂的女工，她在学习与劳动中，也是绝不落后的。他们每一个人的努力学习和积极劳动的精神，都使同学们感到敬佩。
    目前她们正在学习拖拉机的引擎系、燃料系和发电系的课程。在农业劳动方面，他们正热烈地进行棉田的间苗、锄草、治蚜虫，以及麦收等工作。广阔的校园中，从清晨到天黑，你可以看到他们一群群地从教室走向田间，又从田间走向教室，愉快地、紧张地学习着，劳动着。
