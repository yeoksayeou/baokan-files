　　Village Women's Association Director Liu Rongxiao Takes the Lead in Learning with Great Success

　　Liu Rongxiao, the director of the Women's Association in Shibadu Village, Fourth District, Tang County, Hebei Province, is twenty-two years old and a Communist Party member. She attended the village primary school for three years in her childhood. She usually went to the fields with her father for production. At the age of sixteen, she was elected as the director of the Women's Association due to her active labor. Since then, the women's work in the village has been quite active. Due to the education of the Communist Party and her own hard work and active work, she was promoted to a non-detached-from-production women's federation sub-district committee member at the age of eighteen. At the age of twenty, she freely fell in love with Shi Fake, the current secretary of the Youth League Committee in the village, and got married.

　　In addition to actively participating in production and working hard, she also seizes every opportunity to learn. She used the money she earned from spinning and weaving to buy study notebooks, pens, textbooks, etc. She insists on learning two new characters every day. She also takes her study notebook when she returns to her parents' home. In order to facilitate memorizing the characters she has learned, she annotates a familiar character with the same sound next to the new character; during production breaks, she opens the book to read and takes out a pen to write. In this way, she learns and remembers one character at a time until she can recite and write it. Over time, she learned to use a dictionary (a simple dictionary) from others, and took time to ask the school teacher to teach her pinyin. Since then, the dictionary has become her teacher that she carries with her. Now she can write simple letters and notes, and can also understand the Hebei Youth Daily. She often reports the women's work in the sub-district and village to the district at any time, or writes letters. At the same time, she also teaches her husband to read and write letters.

　　She often wants to organize all the young women in the village to learn culture. She convened a women's committee meeting, and with the deputy director Yuan Xiuqin and other seven cadres, actively aroused the women's enthusiasm for learning; and used her own example of learning culture to publicize to everyone. She told them the bitterness of being illiterate, which slowly aroused everyone's interest in learning. At the common request of the young women, the women's noon school was officially established last autumn, and she was elected as the cultural teacher of the noon school. Since then, under her leadership, all sixty-eight young women in the village automatically participate in learning every noon. According to the statistics of the past six months, illiteracy among young women in the village has been basically eliminated, and the least literate know more than fifty characters. After the promulgation of the New Marriage Law, she first took the newspaper to study, used the dictionary to find out the characters she didn't recognize, and asked the primary school teacher about the sentences she didn't understand. After she understood it herself, she explained it to everyone in the noon school class. Afterwards, she organized everyone to discuss in groups. The women felt that they had learned a lot of new and fresh things under her leadership. Everyone praised her and respected her. The work in the village has therefore become more active.

　　村妇女会主任刘荣霄带头学习很有成绩
    河北唐县四区十八渡村妇女会主任刘荣霄，今年二十二岁，是个共产党员。幼时她在本村小学里念过三年书。平时她经常和父亲一块下地生产。十六岁时因积极劳动，村里选她当了妇女会主任。自此以后，该村妇女工作搞的挺活跃。由于共产党对她的教育和她自己埋头苦干，积极工作，十八岁那一年又被提拔为不脱离生产的妇联小区委员。二十岁上，她和该村现任青年团委书记施法科自由恋爱结了婚。
    她除积极生产、努力工作外，还时时刻刻抓紧学习。她把自己纺线、织布赚来的钱买了学习本、钢笔、课本等。天天坚持学会两个生字。回娘家时她也带着学习本子。为了便于记忆学过的字，她在生字旁边注上一个同音的熟字；生产休息的当儿就翻开书来看，拿出笔来写。就这样学一字记一字，直到会背会写时为止。日子久了，她又跟着别人学会了查字典（简单的字典），抽空到学校里请老师教会她拼音。从此字典就变成她随身带着的老师了。她眼下会写简单的书信、便条，也能看懂河北青年报了。她经常把小区及村里的妇女工作随时向区做报告，或写信。同时她还教自己的丈夫识字、学写信。
    她时常想把全村青年妇女组织起来学习文化。她召开了一次妇委会议，与副主任苑秀琴等七名干部积极鼓起妇女的学习情绪；并用自己学习文化的实际例子向大伙宣传。她把不识字的苦处告诉她们，慢慢地引起大伙的学习兴趣。在青年妇女共同要求下，去年秋后正式成立了妇女午校，并选她为午校的文化教员。从此以后，全村六十八名青年妇女，在她的领导下每天晌午自动参加学习。据六个月来的统计，全村基本上扫除了青年妇女中的文盲，识字最少的也在五十个字以上。新婚姻法公布后，她首先把报纸拿来学习，用字典查出不认识的字，不懂的句子就请问小学教员。自己懂得以后，就在午校上课时讲给大伙听。事后又组织大家分组讨论。妇女们觉得在她领导下学到的东西又多又新鲜。大家都称赞她、尊重她。村里的工作也因此搞得更活跃了。
