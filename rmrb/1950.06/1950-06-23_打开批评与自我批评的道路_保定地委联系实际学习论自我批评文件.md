Opening the Path of Criticism and Self-Criticism
    Baoding Prefectural Committee Links Study of Self-Criticism Documents to Reality
    Wang Guiji
    After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals, and the five documents of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong on self-criticism, the Baoding Prefectural Committee of Hebei Province immediately organized cadres to study them seriously. Participants included county committee members, communication officers, and all party member cadres of the prefectural committee's directly affiliated organs, totaling more than 370 people (all studying during work hours to avoid affecting the study of theory and policy). The organs of the prefectural committee and others started from May 8th and ended on the 21st; the counties started from the 10th and ended before the 25th. The method of study was to first study on one's own, discuss, and understand the spirit of the documents, and then conduct self-examination in connection with one's own thinking. After studying, some county committees also explained to district cadres. During the study, everyone felt that the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism in the district was still weak. After a fierce ideological struggle within the Party, the main reasons why criticism and self-criticism could not be launched were found, and several major ideological problems were solved, which improved the ideological level of party member cadres and laid an ideological foundation for carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the future.
    The main reasons why criticism and self-criticism could not be carried out were:
    First, some leading organs adopted a suppressive attitude towards criticism. Some individual leading cadres even retaliated and struck at critics. In this way, lower-level cadres dared not offer opinions, and leaders became detached from the masses. In addition, when shortcomings occurred in the work of some counties, they were only allowed to issue circulars within the county and were not allowed to send them to newspapers for publication. The idea of "family scandals should not be publicized" was very strong. The Anxin and other county committees once withheld criticism manuscripts written by communication officers from sending them to the newspapers. Conversely, they turned a blind eye to reports and praise, even when they knew they contained elements of exaggeration. This bad practice of leaders liking to report good news but not bad news is the main obstacle to the development of criticism and self-criticism.
    Among ordinary cadres, there is a lack of courage to adhere to principles, uphold the truth, and fight against bad ideas; they are afraid of retaliation, afraid of offending people, flattering leaders to their faces, not offering opinions when they have them, and gossiping behind their backs, spreading rumors. The practice of not expressing dissenting opinions on the instructions and handling of problems by higher authorities, even when they know they are wrong, also seriously affects the work and harms the interests of the Party and the people.
    Secondly, the existence of a tendency of harmony at all costs within the Party, caring about face, fearing to hurt feelings, engaging in private favors, mutual accommodation, and mutual cover-up, also hinders the development of criticism.
    Those who are criticized (including leaders) are often afraid of losing face and fear that their superiors will have a bad impression of them when they know their shortcomings, thus creating a bias of secretly correcting shortcomings but not willing to expose them publicly. Comrade Cao Mengchun of the Public Security Department could not sleep for three nights because he was afraid of being published in the newspaper when a mistake occurred in his work. In addition, some counties and districts could not sincerely accept criticism from higher authorities but expressed resistance.
    Finally, the Party's life system is unsound. Some have not held Party group meetings for a long time, so they have not established the habit of regularly carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Or they are all about harmony when there is no criticism, but once criticism is launched, it often leads to unprincipled quarrels, and they cannot use this weapon with the correct attitude to improve their thinking and improve their work.
    After studying the documents and examining their thoughts! The following issues have been initially resolved:
    1. It is recognized that the suppression of criticism by leading organs and leading cadres is a manifestation of being contaminated with bureaucratic habits and feudal ruling ideas. These leaders always feel that they are superior to the masses, only allowing praise and not allowing criticism. They believe that exposing their shortcomings will lose prestige and damage dignity to their subordinates; to their superiors, they fear that the higher party committee will have a bad impression of them. After recognizing the serious harm of this kind of thinking to the Party and the people, leading cadres above the county committee generally have a deeper understanding of the importance of criticism and self-criticism, and have initially established the view of sincerely accepting criticism and using this weapon to improve their work. Wanxian and other counties specifically convened county committee meetings to conduct criticism and self-criticism, and made profound self-examinations of the shortcomings in their work.
    2. The ideological roots of individuals' failure to adhere to principles and uphold the truth are mainly individualism and liberalism. These comrades fear that the higher authorities will not promote them after their shortcomings are exposed. Due to their concern about their own position, they have formed the phenomenon of praising them to their faces and talking nonsense behind their backs. In this study, a sharp criticism was made of this bad idea, and the general comrades began to have the courage to adhere to the truth and carry out criticism. In terms of self-examination, they have also initially established a sincere and humble attitude. For example, in studying the Marriage Law, the general comrades have criticized their own feudal ideas. Several comrades from the Public Security Department have made profound self-examinations of their "only think the Marriage Law is beneficial to women", "cannot get used to free love", and "are patriarchal towards their wives", which was unprecedented in the past.
    3. According to everyone's analysis, the ideological root of the failure to carry out mutual criticism is that petty-bourgeois sentimentalism is at work. The study exposed the harm of sentimentalism to the Party and comrades. It further recognized that self-criticism and mutual criticism are good weapons for common progress and common improvement of work. In checking the unity and cooperation with non-Party people, the revolutionary cadre school of the special zone and Wanxian, etc., criticized certain comrades' left-leaning closed-doorism tendencies, "despising non-Party people", "thinking they are unreliable", and "being superior and arrogant". For example, in checking organizational discipline, the prefectural committee, the commissioner's office, and various departments criticized those who did not return on time after returning home and those who did not adhere to the work system, which all yielded good results.

　　打开批评与自我批评的道路
    保定地委联系实际学习论自我批评文件
    王桂冀
    中共中央发布了关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定，和斯大林毛泽东同志论自我批评的五个文件后，河北省保定地委即组织干部认真学习。参加学习者有各县县委、通讯干事及地委直属机关所有党员干部共三百七十余人（为不影响理论政策学习，均是抽工作时间学习的）。地委机关等从五月八日开始至二十一结束，各县从十日开始至二十五日前结束。学习方法是首先自学、讨论，领会文件精神，然后联系思想进行检查。有的县县委学习后，还向区干部作了讲解。学习中，大家都感到在本区批评与自我批评的空气还很淡薄。经过了激烈的党内思想斗争，找出了批评与自我批评不能展开的几个主要原因，解决了几个主要思想问题，使党员干部的思想水平，提高了一步，给今后开展批评与自我批评，打下了思想基础。
    批评和自我批评开展不起来的原因，主要在于：
    首先，有些领导机关对批评采取压制态度。甚至有个别的领导干部，对批评者实行报复打击。这样，下层干部不敢提意见，领导者脱离了群众。还有的县工作中发生缺点，只准在本县发通报，不许寄报纸发表，“家丑不可外扬”的思想非常浓厚。安新等县县委曾将通讯干事写的批评稿件扣压不寄报社。相反的，对报导表扬的稿件，有时明知有“客里空”的成份，却置之不理。领导干部中这种喜欢报喜不报忧的不良作风，是批评和自我批评开展不起来的主要障碍。
    在一般干部中存在着不能坚持原则，坚持真理，向不良思想进行斗争的勇气；怕报复，怕得罪人，对领导上是当面奉承，有意见不提，背后讲怪话，小广播。对上级的指示及处理的问题，明知不对，但少说为佳，不提反面意见的作风，也严重的影响了工作，损害了党和人民的利益。
    其次，党内存在着一团和气，爱面子，怕伤害感情，私人拉拢，互相迁就，互相包庇的无原则的庸俗的不良倾向，也妨碍了批评的开展。
    被批评者（包括领导在内）往往怕丢面子，怕上级知道了自己的缺点而对自己印像不好，因而产生了有缺点暗里改而不愿公开暴露的偏向。公安处曹孟春同志工作中发生了一点错误，因怕登报，曾三夜睡不着觉。还有的县、区对上级批评不能诚恳接受而表示反抗。
    最后，党的生活制度不健全，有的很长时间不开党的小组会，因之没有树立起经常开展批评与自我批评的习惯。或者是不批评就是一团和气，一旦开展批评起来往往又形成无原则的争吵，不能以正确的态度运用这一武器，提高思想改进工作。
    经过学习文件检查思想！初步解决了以下几个问题：
    一、认识了领导机关和领导干部压制批评是沾染了官僚习气，封建统治思想的表现。这些领导者总觉得自己高出群众一头，只准赞扬，不准批评。认为暴露了自己的缺点，对下丧失威信损害尊严；对上则怕上级党委对自己印象不好。认识了这种思想对党对人民的严重危害后，在县委以上领导干部中一般均较深刻的认识了批评和自我批评的重要，初步的树立了诚恳接受批评并运用这一武器改进工作的观点。完县等县专门召开县委会，进行了批评和自我批评对于工作中的缺点，作了深刻的检讨。
    二、个人方面不坚持原则，不坚持真理的思想根源主要是个人主义自由主义。这些同志怕揭露了缺点后，上级不提拔自己。由于对自己的地位患得患失，就形成了当面捧场，背后乱讲的现象。这次学习中对这种恶劣思想进行了尖锐的批判，一般的同志开始有了坚持真理进行批评的勇气。在自我检讨方面，也初步树立了诚恳虚心的态度。譬如学习婚姻法中，一般同志对自己的封建思想，都进行了批评。公安处有几个同志对自己“只认为婚姻法对妇女有利”、“对自由恋爱看不惯”、“对自己妻子是大丈夫主义”等进行了深刻的检讨，这在过去是从所未有的。
    三、互相批评不能开展的思想根源，据大家分析的结果，认为是小资产阶级的温情主义思想作怪。学习中揭露了温情主义对党和同志的遗害。进一步认识了自我批评与互相批评是共同进步、共同搞好工作的良好武器。专区革命干部学校及完县等在检查与非党群众团结合作中，对某些同志的左倾关门主义倾向，“轻视非党人士”、“认为他们不可靠”、“高人一头，盛气凌人”等进行了批判，又如在检查组织纪律中，地委、专署、各部门对回家不按期回来和不坚持工作制度者，进行了批评，均收效很好。
