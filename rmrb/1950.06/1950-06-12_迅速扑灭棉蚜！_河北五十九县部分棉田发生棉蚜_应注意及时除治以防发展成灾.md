Swiftly Eradicate Cotton Aphids!
    Cotton Aphids Appear in Some Cotton Fields in 59 Counties of Hebei Province; Attention Should be Paid to Timely Prevention and Treatment to Prevent Disastrous Development

    [By Our Newspaper] According to reports from correspondents in various parts of Hebei Province: Aphids have appeared in cotton fields in some areas of Hebei Province and are currently being treated to prevent disastrous development. This year, the province has planted a total of 14 million mu of cotton, and the cotton seedlings have grown to two or three inches. Since early May, cotton aphids have occurred in some cotton fields in eight special districts and 59 counties throughout the province. The southern region experienced earlier infestations, while the northern region experienced later infestations. Aphids are found on approximately 50% of cotton seedlings in the affected areas, with severe infestations reaching 70 to 80 aphids per plant and lighter infestations having 20 to 30 aphids. In response to this situation, the Hebei Provincial People's Government issued instructions to governments at all levels, farms, and cotton production guidance zones on May 18, emphasizing that the success of the cotton harvest directly affects national economic construction and people's livelihoods. It called on cadres at all levels to raise their vigilance with a high sense of responsibility towards the people, overcome the idea of underestimating and neglecting pests, and actively prevent and treat them to avoid widespread disasters. All existing pesticides and machinery stored in provincial and county farms, supply and marketing cooperatives, and cotton production guidance zones must be fully utilized to ensure that pest control and seedling protection work is carried out conscientiously. Special districts also attach great importance to aphid control work, having successively convened agricultural technology conferences or held training classes to study aphid control methods. Technical cadres from provincial farms or high-quality cotton guidance zones explained techniques and practiced preparing pesticides. According to statistics from eight special districts (excluding Tangshan Special District and Tianjin Special District), 1,759 people have been trained. Most counties in Baoding and Tongxian Special Districts have established pest control committees, with villages organizing pest control based on existing mutual aid teams. The Handan Prefectural Office has prepared 400,000 jin of tobacco stems and dispatched 100,000 jin to various counties to solve the problem of pesticides for the masses, and has distributed 3,300 sprayers to various counties. On May 29, the special district organized technicians to carry a large number of sprayers to Yongnian, Wu'an, Cheng'an, Linzhang, Linqing, Guantao, Qiuxian and other places to help control aphids. Currently, aphid control work in various counties has been rapidly launched and initial results have been achieved. For example, in the 50 villages in Hejian, Suning, Renqiu, Jiaohe, and Xianxian where aphids were found, the widespread use of tobacco leaf water and lime water has eliminated 60% to 80% of the cotton aphids. In Wu'an County, the use of sprayers for pest control has had a great effect. Cadres in Yunjialing Village in the Fifth District used two sprayers for an experiment and eliminated aphids on 20 mu of cotton in just one day, boosting the confidence of the masses. The next day, more than 60 people used 30 sprayers. At the same time, weeding and hoeing work has been widely carried out in various places. For example, cotton fields in Xingtai and Dingxian Special Districts have been hoeed once, and two-thirds of the cotton fields in Handan Special District have been hoeed twice. In the high-quality cotton areas of five counties in Shijiazhuang Special District, women and children have been mobilized to pull out more than 218,000 jin of weeds, which has played a significant role in preventing and eliminating aphids. However, at present, some cadres in various counties still do not fully understand the harm of cotton aphids, and there is more or less paralysis of thought. This has caused the aphid infestation in some villages to develop further. In addition, as various places are carrying out the adjustment of cadres, the division of districts, and the upcoming summer harvest and planting, it is easy to relax the pest control work, which should be paid attention to and corrected by leading cadres in various places in order to ensure planting and harvesting, and to successfully achieve this year's cotton production increase target.

　　迅速扑灭棉蚜！
    河北五十九县部分棉田发生棉蚜
    应注意及时除治以防发展成灾
    【本报讯】据河北省各地通讯员报道：河北省部分地区棉田已发生蚜虫，现正进行除治，以防发展成灾。该省今年共种棉花一千四百万亩，棉苗已长到二、三寸。自五月上旬以来，全省已有八个专区五十九个县的部分地区棉田发生棉蚜。南部地区发生较早；北部发生较晚。在已发生的地区约有百分之五十的棉苗上有蚜虫，重者每棵上有七、八十个，轻者有二、三十个。针对这种情况，河北省人民政府曾在五月十八日向各级人民政府、各农场、各棉产指导区发出指示，着重说明棉花的收成与否，直接影响到国家的经济建设和人民生计，号召各级干部必须以对人民高度负责的精神，提高警惕，克服轻视与忽视虫害的思想，必须主动除治，免致蔓延成灾。各省、县农场、供销社、棉产指导区等所存药械必须充分利用，一定要保证认真的作好除虫保苗工作。各专区对除蚜工作亦很重视，曾先后召开了农业技术会议，或举办了训练班，研究治蚜办法，并由省农场或良棉指导区技术干部讲解技术，实习配制药剂。据八个专区（缺唐山专区、天津专区）统计，已训练一千七百五十九人。保定、通县两专区大部县份均已成立防虫委员会，村以原有互助组为基础组织除虫。邯郸专署已准备好烟茎四十万斤，并派汽车送往各县十万斤，以解决各县群众治蚜药剂问题，并已分发各县三千三百架喷雾器。五月二十九日该专区又组织技术人员携带大批喷雾器，分赴永年、武安、成安、临漳、临清、馆陶、邱县等地帮助治蚜。目前各县治蚜工作已迅速展开，并做出了初步成绩。如河间、肃宁、任邱、交河、献县发现蚜虫的五十个村子，曾广泛运用了烟叶水、小灰水等消灭棉蚜百分之六十到百分之八十；武安县使用喷雾器除虫效果很大，五区云驾岭村干部使用两架喷雾器作试验，仅一天就消灭了二十亩棉蚜，群众信心增强，第二天即有六十多人使用起三十架喷雾器。同时，各地还普遍展开了锄棉、拔草工作，如邢台、定县两专区的棉田已普锄一遍，邯郸专区有三分之二棉田锄过两遍；石家庄专区五个县良棉区发动妇女、儿童拔草二十一万八千多斤，对防蚜、灭蚜工作起了很大作用。但目前各县在治蚜中，尚有部分干部对棉蚜的危害性认识不足，或多或少地存在麻痹思想。造成有些村的蚜害更加发展，再加各地正在进行调整干部、划区和即将进行夏收夏种，而容易放松灭虫工作，应引起各地领导干部的注意与纠正，以求保种保收，胜利实现今年棉花增产任务。（陈明善、李锋、树春、展圭、何清、贺年、王万国、崔金祥、纪志彬、高自明、晨山、文元）
