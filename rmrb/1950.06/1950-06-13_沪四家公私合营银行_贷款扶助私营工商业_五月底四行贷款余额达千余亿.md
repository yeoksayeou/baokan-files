[Shanghai News] According to the Liberation Daily, four joint public-private banks in Shanghai, Xinhua, Siming, China Industrial, and China General Commerce, are providing loans to support private enterprises in maintaining production and further improving their operations, under the guidance of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China.

The outstanding loan balance of these four banks reached 102.7 billion yuan by the end of May, an increase of 20% compared to the end of April. Over 90% of the loans were invested in production, especially targeting factories with the determination to overcome difficulties, with a focus on providing loans to them. In the May loan disbursements, 10.7 billion yuan went to the Shanghai Xin Xin Textile Factory General Management Office, 1.5 billion yuan to the Xin Yu Textile Factory (including 1 billion yuan in People's Bank of China acceptances), 2 billion yuan to the De Feng Textile Factory, 1 billion yuan to the China Chemical Industrial Society, 1.15 billion yuan to the Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, 1.4 billion yuan to the Great China Match Company, 875 million yuan to the Fu Zhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, 590 million yuan to the Feilun Thread Factory, and 400 million yuan to the Rong Feng Yarn Factory. Loans are generally granted on the preconditions of normal labor-management relations and self-sufficiency, with borrowers required to propose repayment plans. These plans include using processing fees or the sale of products or surplus materials as collateral. For example, the Shanghai Xin Xin Textile Factory General Management Office repaid 5 billion yuan by the end of May. The loan terms vary; some use acceptance and discount methods with shorter terms, while most loans have terms of one month or more, and some even extend to three months. After the loans are granted, the banks regularly monitor the situation of the borrowing companies and help them improve their operations, with the aim of enabling the companies to generate profits in production.
