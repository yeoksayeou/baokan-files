Ministry of Interior Directs Continued Famine Prevention

[This newspaper report] According to news from this newspaper: The Ministry of Interior of the Central People's Government issued instructions on June 8 regarding the continued prevention of famine. The instructions pointed out that although the spring famine has passed and the wheat harvest is underway in various regions, the disaster relief work of the people in disaster areas and the People's Government cannot be relaxed. It must be recognized that farmers whose families have long been impoverished can only have a slightly better situation after the summer harvest than before, and it is still impossible to completely escape the threat of famine. Moreover, since the beginning of spring, the Su County area in northern Anhui and the Huaiyin area in northern Jiangsu have suffered from floods. Wheat yellow dwarf disease has occurred in some areas of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces. Hailstorms have been very severe in individual areas of southern Shanxi and Henan. Some areas in Suiyuan and Qinghai provinces have also experienced snow disasters and freezing disasters. This has resulted in reduced wheat production or complete crop failure in some areas. We must face this serious situation squarely and continue to fight against new disasters that have occurred or may occur. Any thoughts of complacency or slackness are not allowed.

The instructions pointed out that disaster relief is not easy, and continuous disaster relief is even more difficult. Disaster relief with experience and preparation is easier than disaster relief without experience and preparation. Therefore, the People's Governments in disaster-stricken areas should give full play to the rich experience and tenacious spirit of fighting against famine over the past year and implement the following tasks:

(1) Thoroughly understand the disaster situation. Responsible persons of governments at or above the provincial level should inspect key areas; responsible persons of special districts and county governments should visit all places to grasp the disaster situation and be able to write out practical figures.

(2) Formulate a more comprehensive and long-term disaster relief plan. This plan should include how to organize production for self-relief, how to replant autumn fields, how to thoroughly promote thrift and mutual assistance, how to implement work-for-food programs, and how much material strength the government needs to pay and how to regulate grain.

(3) People's representative conferences or peasant representative conferences at the county level in disaster-stricken areas, and people's representative conferences or peasant representative conferences at the district and township levels, should specifically discuss disaster relief issues to enhance the people's confidence in production and self-relief and promote various production and self-relief methods.

(4) Send capable cadres to help with the work in districts and villages to prevent the recurrence of past work deviations.

(5) Practice thrift in disaster relief. In areas with slightly better summer harvests, we should "use sparingly" and exchange fine grains for coarse grains and mix in substitute foods. In areas with poor summer harvests, thrift should be promoted even more. The movement for thrift and disaster relief in institutions and troops should continue where possible.

(6) Local governments should help disaster victims who have not yet returned home to return or find ways to properly resettle them.

(7) In disaster relief, all departments such as civil affairs, finance, industry and commerce, trade, cooperatives, and health should cooperate well, and there should be no imbalance in any aspect. Production relief committees at all levels should prevent phenomena such as only managing the production of disaster victims' side businesses without managing sales, or blindly purchasing goods that cannot be sold, and disaster victims becoming ill without medicine.

The instructions concluded by saying that this year's disaster relief has achieved great results, demonstrating the superiority of the people's democratic regime. However, some areas started late or the work coordination was not good, and some cadres had bureaucratic and other bad work styles, causing some avoidable harm to the disaster victims. The People's Government, which is responsible to the people, should not allow these phenomena to repeat themselves at all. The National Civil Affairs Conference, scheduled to be held on July 15, will focus on summarizing disaster relief work in addition to discussing democratic governance issues. The People's Governments in areas that are still suffering from famine should take a further step forward on the existing work foundation, grasp policies, conduct in-depth inspections, organize forces, and overcome the summer famine that has occurred and may occur, as well as possible future disasters.

The instructions require all regions to deploy work in a timely manner and report the progress to the Ministry of Interior at any time.

### 内务部指示继续防荒

　　内务部指示继续防荒
    【本报讯】中央人民政府内务部六月八日发出关于继续防备灾荒的指示。指示指出：虽然目前春荒已过，各地正在麦收，灾区人民和人民政府的救灾工作仍然不能松懈。必须认识：家底久空的农民，在夏收以后，光景只能比前稍好，仍不可能完全挣脱灾荒的威胁；而且自入春以来，皖北宿县专区、苏北淮阴专区又遭水灾，河北、平原两省部分地区发生小麦黄疸病，晋南、河南个别地区雹灾甚重，绥远、青海等省亦有部分地区发生雪灾、冻灾，因此造成部分地区小麦减产或根本无收的损失。我们必须正视这一严重情况，继续与已发生或可能发生的新的灾害作斗争。任何麻痹、松懈的思想，都是不能允许的。
    指示指出：救灾不易，救连续的灾更不易，而有经验、有准备地救灾，比无经验、无准备的救灾要易。因此，各有灾地区的人民政府应发挥一年来与灾荒斗争的丰富经验和顽强精神，贯彻进行下列各项工作：
    （一）深入了解灾情。省级以上政府负责人要有重点地去视察；专署、县政府负责人要遍到各处，把握住灾情，要能写出切合实际的数字。
    （二）订出较全盘的、较长期的救灾计划。这个计划应该包括如何组织生产自救，如何补种秋田，如何深入展开节约互助，如何实行以工代赈，以及需要政府支付多少物质力量和如何调剂粮食等项目。
    （三）有灾地区的县各界人民代表会议或农民代表会议，区、乡人民代表会议或农民代表会议，应专门讨论救灾问题，借以提高人民生产自救的信心，推广多种多样的生产自救方法。
    （四）派遣得力干部去帮助区、村工作，防止再发生以前发生过的工作上的偏差。
    （五）节约救灾。夏收稍好地区，应“细水长流”，以细粮换粗粮，掺食代食品。夏收歉收的地区，更应提倡节约。机关、部队的节约救灾运动，在可能情况下仍宜继续。
    （六）目前尚未回家的逃荒灾民，当地政府应帮助他们回家或想法妥为安置。
    （七）救灾中，民政、财政、工商、贸易、合作社、卫生等各部门都应配合得好，不应有那一方面失调。对于灾民副业，只管生产不管销路，或盲目收购销不出去，以及灾民生病无医药等现象，各级生产救灾委员会均应预为防止。
    指示最后说：今年救灾得到很大成绩，表现了人民民主政权制度的优越。但有些地区动手迟了或工作配合不好，有些干部有官僚主义等不良作风，致灾民受到一些可能避免的损害。对人民负责的人民政府，一点也不应使这些现象重复发生。定于七月十五日召开的全国民政会议，除讨论民主建政问题外，将着重总结救灾工作。现在仍有灾荒的地区的人民政府，要在已有的工作基础更向前推进一步，掌握政策，深入检查，组织力量，战胜已发生和可能发生的夏荒以及以后可能有的灾荒。
    指示要求各地及时布置工作并将进行情况随时报告内务部。
