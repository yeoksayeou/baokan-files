　　Resolutely Implement the Guiding Principle of Safe Production

    Today, this newspaper publishes the notice from the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council regarding the handling of the "February 27th" methane gas explosion disaster at the Yiluo Coal Mine in Henan. This notice analyzes the causes of the disaster at the mine, announces the punishments for responsible personnel at all levels, and proposes suggestions for improving industrial and mining safety work. The Organization Department of the National Federation of Trade Unions should carefully study this notice from the People's Supervision Committee to improve safety work in China's industrial and mining industries.

    In the past, the industrial and mining industries operated in China by imperialists and bureaucratic capitalists only focused on increasing production and did not value the lives of workers. In order to obtain super-profits, they drove workers to produce at full capacity while neglecting necessary safety equipment and scientific technical regulations, leading to constant disasters. For example, during the Japanese imperialist rule in Northeast China, more than 3,000 people died in an explosion at the Fushun Coal Mine. In 1939, 342 workers were killed in a single explosion at the new Jingxing Coal Mine.

    In contrast, the management principle of people's industrial and mining enterprises is to value both production and worker safety. This is the "safe production" guiding principle established by the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government at the First National Coal Mine Conference last November. Many of our industrial and mining enterprises have implemented this guiding principle and achieved great success. The Northeast Coal Mine Administration has long put forward the slogan "actively preventing accidents is better than passively handling accidents." And specific measures have been stipulated for ventilation, explosion prevention, fire prevention, and water prevention. Since its implementation, liability accidents have gradually decreased. The Jiaozuo mines in North China and the Jiawang mines in East China have launched mass safety movements and established mass safety groups, which have also played a significant role. This shows that as long as effective safety measures are taken, the situation can be improved, and improvements have already been made.

    However, many unnecessary disasters still occur in many factories and mines. Of course, the safety equipment and safety systems of many factories and mines that we received from the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit gangs were not good, and many disasters could not be prevented. However, a more important reason is that the responsible personnel of many factories and mines have violated the correct guiding principle of "safe production" and have actually implemented wrong guiding principles. The actual daily production capacity of the Yiluo Coal Mine was only about 100 tons, but during the "production competition," the highest daily output reached 302 tons. As a result, damage occurred to the mine's infrastructure, which became the main cause of the accident.

    Those who violate the "safe production" guiding principle do not understand how to rely on the working class to manage industrial and mining production. They ignore the conscious initiative and creativity of the working class and adopt bureaucratic methods of coercion and command towards workers. Therefore, they cannot absorb the wisdom and experience of the working class to avoid many preventable accidents. Before the explosion disaster at the Yiluo Coal Mine, workers had raised objections to the mine's blind production and destruction of infrastructure, pointing out that there was too much methane in the mine and that an explosion was possible. However, these correct opinions were ignored by bureaucrats, and the unfortunate disaster occurred.

    To eliminate accidents, we must first rely on the working class. Because workers have been producing for a long time and understand the situation of factories and mines best; and because of their vital interests, they understand the importance of safety work best. Therefore, by mobilizing the workers' sense of ownership and combining it with safety education, so that they can master safety techniques and scientific principles, a reliable mass safety movement can be formed. On the other hand, a genuine safety responsibility system must be established in the factory management organization. Responsible cadres at all levels in factories and mines should understand that it is a criminal act to cause serious accidents due to neglecting the safety of workers and machines, and they will be subject to legal sanctions.

    To oppose the guiding principle of only focusing on production and neglecting safety, and to promote and implement the guiding principle of safe production, all industrial and mining workers and all workers should work together for this principle.

### 坚决执行安全生产的方针

　　坚决执行安全生产的方针
    本报今日发表政务院人民监察委员会处理河南宜洛煤矿“二、二七”沼气爆炸灾变事件的通报。这个通报分析了该矿这次灾变发生的原因，公布了对各级负责人员的处分，并提出了改进工矿保安工作的意见。全国工矿组织部应当认真学习人民监察委员会这个通报，以改进我国工矿业的保安工作。
    帝国主义者、官僚资本家过去在中国所经营的工矿业，是只顾多生产，不重视工人生命的。他们为了获得超额利润，驱策工人竭力生产，而对于必要的保安设备与科学的技术规程，不加注意，以致灾变不断发生。例如在日本帝国主义统治东北时期，抚顺煤矿在一次爆炸中死去三千余人。一九三九年，井陉煤矿新井也一次炸死工人三百四十二人。
    与此相反，人民工矿业的管理方针，是既重视生产，又重视工人安全。这就是中央人民政府燃料工业部去年十一月在第一次全国煤矿会议上所确定了的“安全生产”的方针。我们许多工矿执行了这个方针，取得了很大的成绩。东北煤矿管理局早已提出“积极防御事故，胜于消极处理事故”的口号。并且规定了通风、防爆、防火、防水等具体办法。施行以来，责任事故已逐渐减少。华北焦作及华东贾汪等矿山，开展了群众性的保安运动，建立了群众保安小组，也有了很大作用。由此可见，只要采取有效的保安措施，情况是可以改善的，而且已经有了改善。
    但是还有不少工厂、矿山，仍然发生了许多不应有的灾变。固然，我们从日寇和国民党匪帮手中接收来的许多工厂矿山的保安设备和保安制度是不好的，有许多灾变是不能预防的，但是更重要的原因，却是许多工厂矿山的负责人员违背了“安全生产”的正确方针，实际上实行了错误的方针。宜洛煤矿实际日产能力只有百吨左右，但在“生产竞赛”中，日产量最高曾达到三○二吨。结果发生矿内工程损坏现象，造成了这次事故的主因。
    违背“安全生产”方针的人，是不懂得依靠工人阶级办理工矿生产的。他们忽视工人阶级自觉的积极性与创造性，而对工人采取强迫命令的官僚主义方法。因此，他们就不能吸收工人阶级的智慧与经验，以避免许多可以避免的事故。宜洛煤矿爆炸灾变发生以前，工人曾对该矿盲目生产、破坏工程的现象提出异议，指出该矿内沼气过多，有发生爆炸的可能。但是，这些正确意见都被官僚主义者置之不理，不幸的灾变于是就发生了。
    消灭事故，必须首先依靠工人阶级。因为，工人长期生产，最了解工厂矿山的情况；更由于切身利害关系，他们最懂得保安工作的重要性。因此，把工人的主人翁思想发动起来，再配合以保安教育，让他们掌握保安技术和科学道理，就可以形成一个可靠的群众性的保安运动。另一方面，必须在工厂管理组织中建立真正的保安负责制度。应该让工厂矿山中各级负责干部懂得，由于忽视工人、机器的安全而发生恶性事故，是一种犯罪行为，是要受到法律制裁的。
    反对只顾生产，不顾安全的方针，提倡与贯彻安全生产的方针，全国工矿工作人员和全体工人，应当为这个原则共同努力。
