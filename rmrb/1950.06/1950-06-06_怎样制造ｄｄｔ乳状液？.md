　　How to Make DDT Emulsion?
    Mr. Su Mianceng, an assistant teacher in the Chemistry Department of Peking University, has recently successfully experimented with a new method for preparing DDT emulsion. The effectiveness of this DDT emulsion is the same as that of commercially available DDT solutions, but its cost is only 1,500 yuan per pound, which is only one-fifth of the selling price of DDT solutions on the market. The preparation method of this DDT emulsion is very simple. It is now introduced as follows:
    First, dissolve 22 grams of pure DDT powder in 44 CC of light oil (light oil can be purchased cheaply from the Shijingshan Coking Plant); separately dissolve 12 grams of soap in 90 CC of water. Pour the light oil solution into the soapy water little by little, stirring vigorously to make the two solutions a very uniform mixture. Then pour this mixed solution little by little into 280 CC of water, stirring constantly, and shaking continuously for five minutes to make a pound of 5% DDT emulsion. If this DDT emulsion is left for a long time, there will be some cheese-like precipitate (but the emulsion is not broken). It can be used again by shaking it.

　　怎样制造ＤＤＴ乳状液？
    北大化学系助教苏勉曾先生，最近实验用新法配制ＤＤＴ乳状液，已经成功。这种ＤＤＴ乳状液的效力和市上出售的ＤＤＴ溶液一样而其成本每磅只需一千五百元，只合市上ＤＤＴ溶液卖价的五分之一。这种ＤＤＴ乳状液的配制方法很简单。现在介绍如下：
    先把二十二克纯ＤＤＴ粉溶解在四十四ＣＣ的轻油里（轻油可以从石景山炼焦厂廉价买到）；另外把十二克肥皂溶解在九十ＣＣ的水里。将轻油溶液一点一点倒在肥皂水里，倒时并不断用力搅拌，使两种溶液成为很均匀的混合溶液。然后再把这种混合溶液一点一点倒在二百八十ＣＣ的水里，并随时搅匀再不断摇动五分钟，就作成了一磅百分之五的ＤＤＴ乳状液。这种ＤＤＴ乳状液放置久了，会有一些乳酪似的沉淀（但并不是乳状液破坏了），只要振荡一下又可使用。
