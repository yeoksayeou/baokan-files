　　Xinji Town Handicraft Industry
    Trials Partnership Management
    [This newspaper, Xinji Town] Since the third session of the People's Representatives Conference in Xinji Town this February, clarified that small handicraftsmen should implement joint sales and joint operations, and partnership production. Four industries including leather shaft industry, knitting industry, leather whip industry, and felt industry, totaling twenty-five households, have been organized to implement a scientific division of labor. As a result, quality has been improved, output has been increased, and costs have been reduced. Now each factory has begun to establish a bonus system for exceeding quotas, and wages are gradually becoming more rational. (Zhao Chun)

　　辛集镇手工业
    试行合伙经营
    【本报辛集镇讯】辛集镇自今年二月第三届各界代表会议，明确了小手工业者要实行联销联营、合伙生产方向后，已先后有皮轴业、针织业、皮鞭业、毡业等四个行业共二十五户，组织起来，实行了科学的分工。因而提高了质量，增加了产量，并降低了成本。现各厂已开始建立了超额奖励制，工资也渐趋合理化。（赵纯）
