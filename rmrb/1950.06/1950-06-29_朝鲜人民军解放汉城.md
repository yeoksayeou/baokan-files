　　Korean People's Army Liberates Seoul
    The Korean People's Army liberated Seoul, the military, political, economic, and cultural center occupied by the Syngman Rhee puppet group, at noon on the 28th of this month. This is a great victory for the Korean people.
    Under the leadership of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and General Kim Il-sung, the patriotic soldiers and civilians of all Korea repelled the invaders in the area north of the 38th parallel on the 25th, the day the Syngman Rhee group launched a full-scale offensive. In order to achieve the unification, independence, freedom, and democracy of the Korean people's motherland, they resolutely eliminated the military forces and terroristic rule of the Syngman Rhee puppet group, which was splitting Korea and launching a civil war, and launched a counter-offensive. This is a completely just action. The people of South Korea warmly welcome the People's Army, support this just counter-offensive, and celebrate their liberation. The rapid liberation of Seoul demonstrates the will of all the Korean people.
    Although the Syngman Rhee group received the full support of American imperialism in its offensive, it still failed rapidly. This is because the Syngman Rhee group has completely lost the support of the people. The planes and cannons of the American imperialists can only help Syngman Rhee lose even more support, and cannot help him gain the support of the people.
    The development of the first few days of the Korean War already shows that, in any case, final victory will inevitably belong to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which represents all the Korean people.

　　朝鲜人民军解放汉城
    朝鲜人民军，已于本月二十八日中午解放李承晚傀儡集团所盘踞的军事政治经济文化中心汉城。这是朝鲜人民的一个伟大胜利。
    全朝鲜的爱国军民，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和金日成将军的领导下，在李承晚集团发动全面进攻的二十五日当天，就在三八线以北地区击退了进犯者，并为了朝鲜人民祖国的统一独立自由和民主，坚决消灭分裂朝鲜、发动内战的李承晚傀儡集团的武力和恐怖统治，实行了反攻。这是完全合乎正义的行动。南朝鲜人民热烈欢迎人民军，支援这一正义的反攻，庆祝自己的解放。汉城所以会这样迅速被解放，正说明了全朝鲜人民的意向。
    李承晚集团虽然得到美国帝国主义的全力支持而进攻，但是仍然迅速失败，这就是因为李承晚集团完全丧失人心的原故。美国帝国主义者的飞机大炮，只能帮助李承晚更加丧失人心，而不可能帮助他取得人心。
    朝鲜战争的最初几天的发展，已经可以叫人看出，无论如何，最后胜利必然属于代表全朝鲜人民的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
