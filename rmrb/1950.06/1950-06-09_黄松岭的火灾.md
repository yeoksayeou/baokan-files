    "The Fire at Huangsongling"
    Su Jian (Artwork) Ma Xun (Poetry)
    (12) Old Zhao was furious when he heard this: "Yan Guaitou, how can you spread such rumors? The Communist Party has led us to turn ourselves over and be liberated, feudal superstition must be overthrown! If this wasn't unintentional, then you are deliberately trying to sabotage things!" Yan Guaitou was clearly timid and panicked, but instead, he yelled loudly: "My good intentions are wasted, and you’re slapping a label on me! Fine! Fine! I can't do this work!"
    (13) The head of the station came to inspect hastily. Yan Guaitou grinned again; "I see this is not right, once in ten years, how could there be a fire?" The head of the station looked it over carelessly, a path was cut through the weeds, "Very good, very good..." and then he hurried away.
    (14) Zhao Jinglin caught up with the head of the station, clumsy and anxious, he spoke: "The firebreak is too narrow, in case the weeds catch fire, the wind will blow the fire over!" Then he said: "Yan Guaitou, his behavior is suspicious, I think you should be vigilant, station chief..." The head of the station disliked Old Zhao's nagging, "Hey, I'm here for everything, don't worry! Go put on your own show! The victorious liberation army is achieving victory after victory, what problems could there be in our Northeast..."
    (15) The head of the station returned, very satisfied; he picked up his pen and laid out the paper, reporting to the higher-ups: "Fire prevention at Songling, measures completed; after inspection, quite reasonable!..." Yan Guaitou, peeking from outside the window; in the large room, only the head of the station. A great opportunity, how could he let it go? Three steps, two steps, he ran towards the lumber yard!

    “黄松岭的火灾”
    苏坚画  马寻诗
    （十二）老赵一听心好恼：“阎怪头，你怎么胡造谣？共产党领导咱们翻了身，封建迷信要打倒！这若不是你无意的话，就是你存心把蛋捣！”阎怪头明明是胆虚心又跳，反倒哇啦哇啦嗓门叫：“咱好心变成了驴肝腑，惹得你给我扣大帽！好！好！这个活，我没法干了！”
    （十三）所长匆匆来检查。阎怪头又裂开大嘴笑；“我看这就不对头，十年九不遇，那能遭火烧？”所长马马虎虎看了看，荒草割开了一条道，“满好，满好……”说完就匆忙的走开了。
    （十四）赵景林追上了所长，嘴笨心急把话讲：“防火道太窄，万一荒草着了火，风一刮火就会扑过来！”接着说：“阎怪头，形迹可疑，我看所长你要提高警惕……”所长嫌老赵啰嗦，“嗳，都有我，你放心吧！快放洋去！解放大军胜利接着胜利，咱们大东北还有啥问题……”
    （十五）所长归来，十分满意；提笔铺纸，汇报上级：“松岭防火，措施完毕；既经检查，颇为合理！……”阎家怪头，窗外偷望；偌大房间，只有所长。大好时机，他岂肯放？三步两步，跑向楞场！
