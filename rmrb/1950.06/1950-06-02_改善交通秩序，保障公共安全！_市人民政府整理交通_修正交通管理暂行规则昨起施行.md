【Beijing Municipal News Agency】To improve traffic order and ensure public safety, the Beijing Municipal People's Government recently announced the "Amended Interim Traffic Management Rules for Beijing," and instructed the Public Security Bureau to reorganize citywide traffic starting from June 1st. The Municipal People's Government promulgated the "Interim Traffic Management Rules for Beijing" on September 10, 1949. Since its implementation, there has been a significant improvement in the city's traffic order. However, recently, individual incidents of rule violations causing accidents have occurred from time to time. The Sixth Meeting of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee also discussed this serious phenomenon. Based on the recent actual traffic conditions in the city, the Municipal People's Government has made relatively important amendments to the management of vehicle speed, pedestrians, and roads in this new set of rules. The amended rules stipulate that the maximum speed for vehicles in urban areas is: small vehicles and motorized bicycles shall not exceed 30 kilometers per hour, and large vehicles shall not exceed 25 kilometers per hour. However, when vehicles are passing by orderly lines, pedestrian crossings, railway and road intersections, warning signs such as "Hospital" and "School," road repair or other construction sites, or passing in front of public places (such as government offices, factories, schools, hospitals, and entertainment venues), the speed should be reduced to no more than 15 kilometers per hour. When vehicles are leaving parking places, passing through city gates or archways, entering main roads from side roads, turning at intersections, traveling on sharp curves or roads with poor visibility, crossing railways or bridges, turning around or reversing, going down steep slopes, or when vehicle brakes, horns, lights, etc., temporarily malfunction, the speed should be reduced to no more than 5 kilometers per hour. Cars are not allowed to overtake trams when they are stopping to pick up or drop off passengers. Regarding the management of pedestrians, the rules stipulate that pedestrians (including children's strollers or similar small vehicles) must walk on sidewalks; where there are no sidewalks, they should walk along the right side of the road. Pedestrians are not allowed to cross roads in areas where crossing is prohibited. Loitering and playing on the road are prohibited, and children under the age of six must not walk alone on the road without being led by someone. Fishing or loitering near bridges is prohibited. The amended rules also stipulate that when military or school groups are passing in formation, they should maintain columns of no more than three lines, unless otherwise approved by the Public Security Bureau under special circumstances, and leave a distance of more than 10 meters between each company or groups of 120 to 150 people, so as to facilitate the passage of vehicles, horses, and pedestrians. When passing through intersections, they should pass at a run. When traveling at night, the lead and tail of the procession, and the leftmost personnel, should carry marker lights.
    Regarding road management, the amended rules stipulate that all temporary sheds, arches, or piles of goods occupying roads must be reported to the Public Security Bureau for permission. Street vendors must also obtain permission from the Public Security Bureau before setting up stalls. Street vendors who have already set up stalls before the promulgation of these rules may be ordered by the Public Security Bureau to relocate if they are deemed to obstruct traffic. The amended rules also contain detailed provisions regarding penalties for violations, with efforts made to persuade and educate in cases of minor violations, and penalties imposed in accordance with regulations for more serious cases.

　　改善交通秩序，保障公共安全！
    市人民政府整理交通
    修正交通管理暂行规则昨起施行
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府为改善交通秩序，保障公共安全，顷公布“修正北京市交通管理暂行规则”，并饬由公安局自六月一日起重新整理全市交通。市人民政府曾于一九四九年九月十日公布“北京市交通管理暂行规则”，自施行以来，市内交通秩序已有显著改进。但近来又时常有个别违犯规则肇祸事件发生，京市第二届各界人民代表会议协商委员会第六次会议上亦曾对此种严重现象提出讨论。根据近来市内交通实际情况，市人民政府在此次新规则中对汽车行驶速度的管理和行人、道路的管理等方面都作了较重要的修正。修正规则规定：汽车在市区行驶的最高速度为：小型车及机器脚踏车每小时不得超过三十公里，大型车每小时不得超过二十五公里。但是汽车行驶中如经过整队行列旁边或行人杂沓、铁道与道路交叉、设有“医院”、“学校”等警告标牌，修路或其他施工地点等处所，或经过公共场所（如机关、工厂、学校、医院及娱乐场所等）门前时，速度应减低到每小时不超过十五公里。汽车驶出停车地点时，通过城门或牌坊时，从支路进入干路时，在交叉路口转弯时，行经急弯或弯路视线不清时，经过铁路或桥梁时，调转车头或倒车时，下陡坡时和车辆制动器、喇叭、灯光等临时发生故障时，速度应减低到每小时不超过五公里。电车停车上下乘客时，汽车一律不得超越。关于行人的管理，该规则规定：行人（包括儿童坐卧游戏车，或与其相类似之小车）须在人行道上行走，没有人行道的道路，应沿道路右侧行走。各路口禁止横断区域内，行人不得擅行通过。道路上禁止逗留玩耍，未满六岁的儿童无人率领者，不得在道路上单独行走。桥梁附近禁止垂钓或任意逗留。该修正规则并规定：军队、学校整队通行时，除有特殊情况经公安局核准者外，应保持三路以下纵队，并于每连或一百二十人至一百五十人的队伍间，酌留十公尺以上距离，以便车马行人通行。行经交叉路口时，并应跑步通过。夜间通行时，行列排头、排尾，最左侧人员应携带标灯。
    关于道路的管理修正规则规定：凡支搭临时席棚、牌楼、或堆置物品占用道路时，都须报请公安局许可。摊贩亦须经公安局许可后方得摆设。在本规则未公布前已摆设的摊贩，公安局认为有碍交通时，得令其择地迁移。关于违章罚则，该修正规则中亦有详细的规定，除情节轻微的应尽量进行说服教育以外，较重的则实行按章处罚。
