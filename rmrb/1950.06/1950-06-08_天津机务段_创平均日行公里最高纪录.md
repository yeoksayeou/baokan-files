　　Tianjin Locomotive Depot
    Sets Highest Average Daily Mileage Record
    [Tianjin News] Tianjin Daily News: The average daily locomotive mileage of the Tianjin Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Railway Bureau has reached 474.2 kilometers, creating the highest average daily locomotive mileage record among all locomotive depots in the country. The quality of locomotives has been continuously improved, accidents caused by poor maintenance of locomotives have disappeared, and temporary repairs have also been greatly reduced.
    The main reason for the depot's creation of a new record for daily locomotive mileage is that, on the basis of launching the Red Flag Emulation Drive in April and the promulgation of reward measures by the Tianjin Bureau, it also absorbed the advanced experience of the Northeast and launched the Model Locomotive Team movement, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of locomotive crew members. At present, among the 53 operating locomotives in the depot, 7 have reached the standards of basic team members of the Ministry's Model Locomotive Team; 18 have become formal members; and 28 have become reserve members. In order to improve their technical level, crew members actively learn from the workers in the maintenance group, which improves the quality of the locomotives and greatly reduces temporary repairs. In early May, the number of locomotive inspection subsidy workers was reduced by eleven.

　　天津机务段
    创平均日行公里最高纪录
    【天津讯】天津日报消息：天津铁路局天津机务段机车日行公里，平均已达四七四点二公里，创造了全路各机务段平均机车日行公里的最高纪录。机车质量不断提高，机车因检修不良而发生的事故，已经绝迹，临时修理亦大大减少。
    该段创造了机车日行公里新纪录的主要原因，是在四月份开展红旗竞赛运动，及天津局颁布奖励办法的基础上，又吸收了东北的先进经验，发起了模范机车队运动，大大刺激了机车乘务员的积极性。目前，全段五十三台运用机车中，已有七台达到部令模范机车队基干队员的标准；十八台成为正式队员；二十八台成为预备队员。乘务员为提高技术水平，主动向检修组的工人学习，使机车质量提高，临时修理大大减少。五月初即减少了机车检点补助工十一人。
