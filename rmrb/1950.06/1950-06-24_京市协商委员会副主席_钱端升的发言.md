Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: The following is the text of the speech given by Qian Duansheng, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Consultative Committee, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: Chairman, esteemed members, comrades:

	I am speaking on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee.

	The first session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference was convened even before the People's Political Consultative Conference. We followed the instructions personally given by Chairman Mao, and then, in accordance with Article 14 of the Common Program, when we convened the Second Session of the People's Representative Conference in November of last year, we elected our own Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and members of the Municipal People's Government. Since then, in a short period of six months, our own people's government has completed land reform in 280 villages in the suburbs, formulated a work plan for 1950 focusing on the restoration and development of production, and on municipal construction, cultural, educational, and health undertakings serving the working people, compiled a revenue and expenditure budget for 1950 that basically achieves a balance, and convened people's representative conferences in two districts to carry out democratic government construction. The reason we have been able to achieve these excellent results is primarily due to the direct and close leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and also because the democratic parties, people's organizations, and ethnic groups in Beijing have been able to unite and cooperate. The people of Beijing, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, have formed a strong and powerful united front. Our united front has achieved results in the past because it adhered to the Common Program, and we believe that it will be able to achieve even better results in the future.

	The reports made by Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Liu, and the heads of the government have inspired us and the people of China. From the work in Beijing, we have keenly experienced how the various departments of our Central People's Government are working loyally to realize the Common Program and striving for China's independence, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity. Whether in democratic government construction, in military affairs, in diplomacy, in finance and economics, in culture and education, or in the judiciary, the achievements of the past eight months have been brilliant and enormous. We express our warmest support for all the measures taken by the Central People's Government.

	We support Chairman Mao's instruction to make the land reform issue the central topic of this conference. We unanimously believe that land reform is the most fundamental condition for liberating rural productive forces and for China to move towards industrialization. We fully agree with Vice Chairman Liu's report on land reform and the draft Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China.

	Future land reform, as Vice Chairman Liu said, must be carried out "with leadership, in a planned way, and in an orderly manner" in full accordance with government decrees and decisions, and "chaotic phenomena must not be allowed to occur." Precisely because "land reform is a systematic and fierce struggle," the leading organs must "effectively grasp the leadership of the movement." In the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, we personally experienced that this is very important. The correct leadership was a decisive key to why no chaotic phenomena occurred in the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing.

	The widespread study of policies related to land reform among cadres, so that cadres, especially some newly recruited intellectuals, can correctly understand and grasp the policies, is very important for ensuring the smooth progress of land reform. We have also fully proven this point in the practice of land reform in the suburbs of Beijing.

	To implement the land reform policy, it is necessary to rely on the poor peasants and farm laborers as the backbone and consolidate the unity of the middle peasants, form a strong team, and rely on farmers' associations, farmers' representative conferences, rely on the combination of work teams composed of cadres and farmers' associations, and rely on the masses of peasants to carry it out. This will not only ensure the smooth completion of land reform but also establish and maintain the revolutionary order in the countryside and prevent indiscriminate arrests, beatings, killings, and other chaotic phenomena. This point may be difficult for some of our friends without land reform experience to understand at first, but some friends who have actually participated in land reform in the suburbs of Beijing quickly understand this truth.

	Establishing a revolutionary order of people's democracy in the countryside is an extremely great task. The broad masses of peasants have been oppressed by the feudal landlord class for a long time, and now that they have turned over, it is very natural for them to complain and even seek revenge. However, some landlords may feel that the peasants turning over is disorder, so it is impossible for them to maintain the feudal order of the landlord class's rule. As long as there are no indiscriminate arrests, beatings, or killings, and no chaos occurs, this is a good order.

	Regarding rich peasants, the principle of preserving the rich peasant economy is correct. The experience of land reform in the suburbs of Beijing also proves that the policy principle of generally not touching the land and property of rich peasants in the future is correct and feasible.

	There is also an experience from land reform in the suburbs of Beijing that is worth mentioning. During the land reform, hundreds of university students and professors also participated in the work. They helped explain the land reform policy to the peasants; they helped do investigation and registration work. They have made certain contributions to the progress of land reform work. In the actual work, the intellectuals themselves have also acquired a relatively firm class stance, abandoning the position they used to think was supra-class but was actually dependent on the reactionary ruling class. They are able to further move closer to the laboring people, know how to rely on the masses, how to take the mass line, and thus improve their attitude of serving the people. In this one or two months of practical work, the transformation that intellectuals have obtained is far greater than the transformation that can be obtained by staying in school for a year and a half. Due to participating in land reform work, the educational method that actual practice is consistent with theory has been specifically proven to be the truth.

	This experience in the suburbs of Beijing is beneficial to both the progress of land reform and the transformation of higher education, and it is worth appropriately promoting.

	Esteemed members, comrades, completing this great revolutionary cause of land reform is the most necessary condition for striving for a fundamental improvement in the state's financial and economic situation. Let us, all the members and comrades, call on every unit in the united front, call on the people of the whole country, to assist the government and strive to implement the land reform law that will be promulgated and to complete land reform!

    京市协商委员会副主席
    钱端升的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】北京市各界人民代表会议协商委员会副主席钱端升在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，文如下：主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我代表北京市各界人民代表会议协商委员会发言。
    北京市各界人民代表会议首次召开尚在人民政协召开以前。我们遵照了毛主席亲自给予的指示，后又依据共同纲领第十四条，于去年十一月召开第二届各界人民代表会议时，即选举了我们自己的市长、副市长和市人民政府委员。从那时起，在短短六个月期间内，人民自己的政府完成了郊区二百八十个村庄的土地改革，制定了以恢复和发展生产，并以服务于劳动人民的市政建设文教卫生事业为重点的一九五○年度工作计划，编定了基本上做到收支平衡的一九五○年度收支概算，又召开两个区的各界人民代表会议，以开展民主建政的工作。我们所以能够获得这些优良成绩，首先是由于毛主席和中央人民政府直接的、就近的领导，同时也是由于北京市各民主党派、各人民团体及各民族能够团结与合作。我们北京市的各界人民，在中国共产党北京市委员会领导之下，已经结成了一个坚强有力的统一战线。我们的统一战线在过去因为遵守共同纲领有了成绩，我们相信今后必可做出更好的成绩。
    毛主席、刘副主席及政府各位首长所作的报告，鼓舞了我们，鼓舞了全中国的人民。从北京市的工作中，我们亲切地体验到：我中央人民政府各部门怎样忠诚地为实现共同纲领而努力，为中国的独立、民主、和平、统一和富强而奋斗。无论在民主建政方面，在军事方面，在外交方面，在财经方面，在文教方面，在司法方面，八个月来的成绩都是辉煌而巨大的。我们对于中央人民政府的一切设施，表示最热烈的拥护。
    我们拥护毛主席指示，以土地改革问题为此次会议的中心议题。我们一致认为土改是解放农村生产力，是中国走向工业化的最基本的条件。我们完全同意刘副主席关于土地改革问题的报告，和中华人民共和国土地改革法草案。
    今后的土地改革，诚如刘副主席所说，必须完全按照政府的法令及决定，“有领导地、有计划地、有秩序地去进行”，“不能容许混乱的现象发生”。正因为“土地改革是一场系统的激烈的斗争”，所以领导机关，必须“切实地掌握运动的领导”。在京郊土地改革中，我们亲身体验到这一点很重要。京郊土地改革所以没有发生混乱现象，正确的领导是一个决定的关键。
    在干部中普遍进行有关土地改革政策的学习，使干部，特别是一些新参加工作的知识分子，正确地了解掌握政策，对于保证土地改革的顺利进行，关系甚为重要。我们在京郊土地改革的实践中也充分证明这一点。
    执行土地改革政策，必须依靠贫农雇农作中坚并且巩固的团结中农，组成有力的队伍，必须依靠农民协会、农民代表会，依靠由干部组成的工作队和农民协会相结合，依靠农民群众来进行。这样不仅可以保证土改顺利完成，而且可以建立与保持农村的革命秩序，防止乱捕乱打乱杀及其他混乱现象。这一点，对于我们一些没有土改经验的朋友们，开始时也许很难理解，但有些朋友凡是到京郊实际参加土改以后，都很快地了解了这一真理。
    在农村建立人民民主的革命秩序，是一件极其伟大的工作。广大农民长期在封建地主阶级的压迫下，现在一翻身就要诉苦，甚至要报复，这本是很自然的。但是一些地主阶级也许觉得农民翻身，就是无秩序，因此他们要想保持地主阶级统治的封建秩序，那是不可能的。只要不乱捕乱打乱杀，不发生混乱，这就是很好的秩序。
    关于富农，保存富农经济的原则是正确的。京郊土地改革的经验也证明了今后一般地不动富农土地财产这一政策原则是正确而可行的。
    京郊土地改革还有一个经验值得提出。在土地改革进行中，有几百个大学生和教授也参加了工作。他们帮助向农民讲明土改政策；他们帮助做调查和登记的工作。对于土地改革工作的进行，他们有过一定的贡献。在实际的工作中，知识分子自己也取得了比较坚定的阶级立场，抛弃了过去自以为是超阶级而实则是依附反动统治阶级的立场。他们能够进一步的向劳动人民大众靠拢，晓得怎样依靠群众，怎样走群众路线，因而改进了为人民服务的态度。在这一两个月的实际工作中，知识分子所得到的改造，远过于一年半载留在学校中所能获得的改造。由于参加土地改革工作，实际与理论一致这个合乎真理的教育方法乃有了具体的证明。
    京郊这一个经验对于土地改革的进行，对于高等教育的改造，两有利益，值得适当的加以推广。
    各位委员，各位同志，完成土地改革这一伟大的革命事业，是争取国家财政经济状况基本好转的最必要的条件。让我们全体委员同志们，号召统一战线中的每一个单位，号召全国人民，来协助政府，为实施将要公布的土地改革法，为完成土地改革而奋斗！
