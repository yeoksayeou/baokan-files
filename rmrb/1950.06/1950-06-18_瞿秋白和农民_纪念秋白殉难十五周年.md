　　Qu Qiubai and the Peasants
　　——Commemorating the Fifteenth Anniversary of Qiu Bai's Martyrdom
　　Yang Zhihua
　　Qiu Bai was one of the outstanding leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. Qiu Bai's views on the peasant question during the First Great Revolution showed that he stood on the same position as Comrade Mao Zedong at that time.

　　As early as the Third National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1923, Qiu Bai, in the draft party program he drafted, put forward the assertion that "the revolution cannot succeed without the participation of peasants" (this sentence was modified by Chen Duxiu to "the revolution will be very difficult to succeed without the participation of peasants"). At the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Party in Beijing in September 1925, he "first firmly supported the proposition of land to the tillers." (See Qu Qiubai: "Controversial Issues in the Chinese Revolution," 1928 edition, pages 94-95). In August 1926, Qiu Bai's speech in Guangzhou, "The Peasant Question in the National Revolution," further affirmed that "the history of the Chinese revolution was previously a history of peasant revolution," and pointed out that the key to the success or failure of the National Revolution at that time lay in whether the peasant land problem could be solved. Qiu Bai said:

　　"If the National Government can gain the support of the peasants, then the National Government can be consolidated, and the struggle against imperialism can be victorious. Only a party that truly supports the workers and peasants can lead the Chinese revolution.

　　In fact, whoever can represent the interests of the workers and peasants, whoever can give the workers and peasants political power, then whoever can solve the peasant problem. It is necessary to suppress the landlords and overthrow the landlord forces in order to win over the peasant masses, consolidate the foundation of the revolution, and eliminate the power of imperialism in China. If one is afraid of the strength of peasant organizations, afraid of peasant riots and shrinks back, and does not dare to put forward a political program for the benefit of the peasants, and does not implement a political program for the benefit of the peasants, one will certainly not be able to gain the support of the peasants, and will be attacked and opposed by the peasants. In short: the Chinese National Revolution is to solve the peasant problem, the land problem, and to fight with the united front of all classes and the leadership of the working class in order to achieve victory. ……

　　The peasant movement has now risen higher and higher, and urgently needs a political program to protect the peasants and the combination of worker-peasant forces. Party members who are loyal to the revolution must immediately make a determination to punish landlords, compradors, local bullies, and evil gentry. Do not ignore that this is a major issue at present, a major issue of the National Revolution.

　　The most concrete methods are:

　　(1) Solve the economic constraints of peasants, and solve them practically with political forces, setting the slogan of "land to the tillers."

　　(2) Arm the peasants and organize peasant self-defense forces so that they have their own armed forces to protect their own interests.

　　(3) Peasants participate in political power, rural political power belongs to the peasants, and cities should also have peasant representatives. All administrative matters must be decided by the peasants and general people's representative assembly before they can be implemented.

　　(4) Severely and ruthlessly suppress all counter-revolutionary movements of the comprador landlord class and deprive them of their political power." (See Qu Qiubai's unpublished manuscript, Volume 5)

　　Qiu Bai's revolutionary ideas were suppressed by right-leaning opportunists such as Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi within the Party at that time. Qiu Bai's struggle with right-leaning opportunists within the Party reached an extremely acute point in the booklet "Controversial Issues in the Chinese Revolution" he wrote in February 1927. The original title of Qiu Bai's booklet was "The Third International or the Zero International? - Menshevism in the Chinese Revolution -", which meant that Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi were Mensheviks, who would be rejected by the revolutionary Third International and despised by the imperialist Second International. Chapter 4, "How to Compete for Leadership," section 5 of this booklet specifically talks about the peasant question, refuting Peng Shuzhi's rhetorical question, "Is the Chinese revolution a peasant revolution?" Qiu Bai said here:

　　"The central point of the Chinese revolution is the peasant revolution. Our attack on the counter-revolutionary landlord class is for the thorough solution of the farmland problem; our... joint action with the national bourgeoisie (united front) should be limited to not undermining the work among the peasants, beyond this limit, there is a bounden duty to part ways with the national bourgeoisie. ... The basic slogan of land to the tillers is very important. ... Peasant tenants may themselves take action to occupy farmland. Such "riots" are not what revolutionaries are afraid of. Of course, we should strive to organize this offensive. In short, we must make the peasant tenants feel that the land they cultivate should rightfully belong to them." ("Controversial Issues in the Chinese Revolution" pages 133-136)

　　In March 1927, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote the immortal "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," but Peng Shuzhi and others prevented it from being published in the Party newspaper. Qiu Bai fought for its publication as a separate edition and also wrote a preface. In his continuous speech "The Fundamental Problems of the Chinese Revolution" in June of that year, Qiu Bai emphasized that the Chinese revolution at that time had penetrated into the "stage of peasant land revolution." This speech made the following enthusiastic eulogy to the peasant movement:

　　"Peasants account for the absolute majority of the Chinese population. If the Chinese population is 450 million, and peasants account for 80 percent, then the number of peasants is 360 million, which is an alarming number. Just from this point, we can see that the importance of Chinese peasants in the Chinese revolution is absolute. We said earlier that the real foundation of exploitation in China by imperialism and warlords is built on the exploitation of peasants. Therefore, the only way to truly break the foundation of imperialism and warlords in China is for the peasants to rise up in revolution.

　　The exploitation and oppression suffered by Chinese peasants, and the hardships of their lives, can be said to be unparalleled in the world. ... They only have one way out, which is to resolutely rise up to resist, rise up to break the status quo, and rise up in revolution. Therefore, the revolutionary nature of Chinese peasants is stronger than that of peasants in any country in the world, especially the poor peasants. Poor peasants account for a large number of all Chinese peasants. According to the survey of the peasant associations in Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong, poor peasants account for about 70 percent of the peasants. Comrade Mao Zedong personally went to Hunan to investigate several counties in Xiangtan and Hengyang, and poor peasants accounted for 70 percent. The lives of these 70 percent of poor peasants are in a state of extraordinary hardship, so their revolutionary spirit is stronger and more resolute, and they are more courageous and thorough on the revolutionary front. ... Here we should 'thank, thank' the imperialist warlords, compradors, bureaucrats, landlords, local bullies, and evil gentry! Because as a result of the harsh exploitation and oppression they have inflicted on the peasants, the peasants have become the bravest, most resolute, and greatest revolutionary force in the Chinese revolution. In other words, the imperialist warlords, compradors, landlords, local bullies, and evil gentry have used their 'exploitation and oppression' to train a vast, powerful, brave, and good-at-fighting army for our Chinese revolution. This is a priceless treasure in the Chinese revolution and a guarantee for the future victory and success of the revolution." ("The Fundamental Problems of the Chinese Revolution" pages 70-73)

　　Elsewhere, Qiu Bai described the peasant movement in Hunan at that time in more detail:

　　"Now the peasants in Hunan have risen up to seize arms and seize political power, and have demanded a fundamental solution to the land problem. There are similar situations in Hubei. This phenomenon proves that the Chinese revolution has indeed reached the deepest stage, the stage of peasant revolution, the stage of land revolution. Since the peasants rose up to seize arms and seize political power, and demanded land, the entire feudal system in the countryside has been shaken and overthrown. ... In short, it's reversed, reversed! The entire feudal rural society has been completely reversed, it is truly 'turning the world upside down', 'reversing the universe'! But this is a real revolutionary phenomenon, this is a real 'peasant revolution', a revolution that thoroughly sweeps away all feudal and patriarchal remnants in the countryside, and a revolution that fundamentally eliminates the foundation of exploitation of imperialism and feudal warlords in the countryside." (Ibid., pages 170-172)

　　In the conclusion of this booklet, Qiu Bai proposed: "Now there is a touchstone of revolution, placed in front of all revolutionary parties and all revolutionaries. This touchstone is the issue of the peasant land revolution. I think all revolutionary parties and revolutionaries will reveal their true colors in front of this peasant issue. In other words, the current test of whether a revolutionary party or a revolutionary is truly revolutionary is to look at their attitude towards the peasant land revolution. This is something that cannot be faked." (Ibid., pages 199-200). How similar this is to what Comrade Mao Zedong said at the beginning of the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," "All revolutionary parties and revolutionary comrades will be tested by them and decide whether to adopt or discard them"!

　　Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese revolution, after experiencing countless hardships, has finally succeeded, and the ideals of all the martyrs who died for the revolution in Chinese revolutionary history have finally been realized. The Chinese people's democratic revolution, mainly composed of peasants, overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and expelled the aggressive forces of imperialism. In the old liberated areas where land reform has already been implemented, farmers and farm women have obtained land and farm implements, obtained political power, obtained freedom, and are obtaining the right to improve seeds, build water conservancy projects, and develop cooperatives. Land reform in the newly liberated areas will also be carried out soon. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which is holding a meeting in Beijing with the central topic of realizing land reform on a national scale, will soon pass the draft of the new Chinese Land Reform Law. This will be the greatest fruit of the Chinese revolution. Chinese peasants cannot but thank Chairman Mao for his wise leadership for obtaining this great fruit, and the hot blood shed by Qiu Bai and thousands of martyrs has thus been exchanged for a great price. At such a time, we commemorate Qiu Bai and revisit Qiu Bai's remarks on the Chinese peasant question more than 20 years ago, and we also feel comforted!

　　瞿秋白和农民
    ——纪念秋白殉难十五周年
    杨之华
    秋白是中国共产党杰出的领导者之一。秋白在第一次大革命时代对农民问题的见解，表现了他在那个时期是和毛泽东同志站在一个立场上的。
    早在一九二三年中共第三次代表大会时，秋白在他所起草的党纲草案中，就提出了“不得农民参加革命不能成功”的论断（这句话被陈独秀修改为“不得农民参加革命很难成功”）。到了一九二五年九月党中央的北京扩大会议，他“首先坚决赞成耕地农有的主张。”（见瞿秋白：《中国革命中之争论问题》，一九二八年版九四——九五页）。一九二六年八月，秋白在广州的演讲“国民革命中的农民问题”，进一步认定“以前中国革命史是一部农民革命史”，并且指出当时国民革命成败的关键，也就在于能否解决农民土地问题。秋白说：
    “国民政府能够得到农民，则国民政府才能巩固，反帝国主义的斗争才能得到胜利。真实拥护工农的党，才能够领导中国革命。
    在事实上，谁能代表工农利益，谁能给工农以政权，那末谁就能够解决农民问题。必需要压迫地主，打倒地主势力，才能获得农民群众，革命的基础才能巩固，才能排除帝国主义在中国的权力。如其怕农民组织的强大，怕农民暴动而畏缩，不敢提出为农民利益的政纲，不实行为农民利益的政纲，必定因此不能得到农民的拥护，且要受农民的攻击和反对。总之：中国国民革命是要解决农民问题，土地问题，用各阶级的联合战线和工人阶级的领导来斗争，才能得到胜利。………
    农民运动到现在已日益高涨了，很急切的需要一个保护农民的政纲及农工势力的结合。忠实于革命的党人要即刻拿出决心来制裁地主、买办、土豪、劣绅。不要忽视了，这是目前重大的问题，是国民革命的重大问题。
    最具体的办法是：
    （一）解决农民经济的束缚，用政治势力切实解决之，定“耕地农有”的标语。
    （二）武装农民，组织农民自卫军，使他有自己的武装保护他自己的利益。
    （三）农民参加政权，乡村的政权归农民，城市的也要有农民代表，凡是行政要有农民与一般人民代表会决定后才能实行。
    （四）严厉的无情镇压一切买办地主阶级之反革命运动，剥夺其政权。”（见瞿秋白遗稿抄本第五册，未出版）
    秋白的这种革命主张，在当时是受到党内右倾机会主义分子陈独秀、彭述之等压制的。秋白与党内右倾机会主义分子的斗争，在一九二七年二月他所写的《中国革命中之争论问题》的小册子中达到了极尖锐的地步。秋白的小册子原题“第三国际还是第零国际？——中国革命中之孟塞维克主义——”，便是指陈独秀彭述之等为孟塞维克，将被革命的第三国际所拒绝，被帝国主义的第二国际所唾弃而说的。这本小册子的第四章“如何去争领导”的第五节专讲农民问题，驳斥彭述之关于“中国革命难道是农民革命？”的反诘。秋白在这里说：
    “中国革命中的中枢是农民革命。我们对反革命派地主阶级的进攻，是为着农地问题的彻底解决；我们……和民族资产阶级的共同行动（联合战线），应当以不破坏农民中的工作为限度，过此限度，便有与民族资产阶级分道扬镳的天职。……耕地农有的基本口号是非常重要的。……农民佃户亦许自己就要动手占据耕地。这种“暴动”不是革命党人所怕的。当然，我们应当努力去组织这种进攻。总之，要使农民佃户觉得他所耕的田是理应属于他自己的。”（《中国革命中的争论问题》一三三—一三六页）
    一九二七年三月，毛泽东同志写了不朽的“湖南农民运动考察报告”，但是被彭述之等阻止不能在党报上发表。秋白力争出了单行本，还写了序。秋白在这年六月所作的《中国革命的根本问题》的连续讲演，着重指出当时的中国革命已经深入到“农民土地革命的阶段”。这个讲演对农民运动作了如下的热烈的歌颂：
    “农民在中国人口中，占绝对的大多数。如果以中国人口四万万五千万，农民占百分之八十计算，则农民人数为三万万六千万，这是一个可惊的数目，我们单就这一点，看中国农民在中国革命中的重要是绝对的。我们在前面曾经说过，帝国主义和军阀在中国剥削的真正基础，是建筑在农民的剥削上。那末，要真正打破帝国主义和军阀在中国的基础，就只有农民起来革命。
    中国农民所受的剥削，所受的压迫，其生活的困苦，可以说在全世界上是无比的。……他们只有一条生路，便是坚决地起来反抗，起来打破现状，起来革命。因此，中国农民的革命性，比现在世界任何国家的农民要强烈，特别是那班贫农。贫农在中国全体农民中，要占一个很大的数量。据湖南湖北广东农民协会的调查，贫农在农民中约占百分之七十。毛泽东同志曾经亲到湖南调查湘潭衡阳数县，贫农都占百分之七十。这些百分之七十的贫农，其生活都呈奇异的困苦状态，所以他们的革命精神更强烈而更坚决，他们在革命战线上更勇敢而更彻底。……我们在这里应该‘感谢感谢’帝国主义军阀买办官僚地主土豪劣绅！因为农民受他们严酷剥削和压迫的结果，变成了中国革命中最勇敢的最坚决的最伟大的革命势力，换句话说，就是帝国主义军阀买办地主土豪劣绅，用他们的‘剥削和压迫’，替我们中国的革命，锻炼一支广大的强有力的勇敢善战的军队。这是中国革命中无价之宝，是中国将来革命得到胜利和成功的保障。”（《中国革命的根本问题》七○——七三页）
    在另一处，秋白更详细地描写了当时湖南的农民运动：
    “现在湖南的农民已经起来夺取武装夺取政权了，已经要求根本解决土地问题了，湖北也有同样的情形。这种现象证明中国革命确是到了一个最深入的阶段了，农民革命的阶段，土地革命阶段了。自从农民起来夺取武装夺取政权，要求土地，于是把乡村整个封建制度动摇了，而且推翻了。……总而言之，反了，反了！整个封建乡村社会完全倒转来了，真是‘翻天覆地’，‘倒转乾坤’！可是这是真正的革命现象，这是真正的‘农民革命’，是真正彻底扫荡乡村一切封建与宗法的残余势力的革命，是根本扫除帝国主义和封建军阀在乡村的剥削基础的革命。”（同上书一七○——一七二页）
    秋白在这本小册子的结论中提出：“现在有一个革命的试金石，摆在一切革命党及一切革命党人的前面。这试金石便是农民的土地革命问题。我以为一切革命党和革命党人都将要在这农民问题前面显露他们的本来面目，换言之，现时测验革命党或革命党人是否真正革命的，只要看他们对于农民土地革命问题的态度，这是一点也不能作伪的。”（同上书一九九——二○○页）这和毛泽东同志在“湖南农民运动考察报告”开始时所说的“一切革命的党，革命的同志，都将在他们面前受他们的检验而决定弃取”的话，是多么相象啊！
    在毛主席的领导下，经历了千辛万苦的中国革命终于成功了，中国革命史上一切为革命死难烈士们的理想终于实现了。以农民为主力的中国人民民主革命，推翻了国民党的反动统治，驱逐了帝国主义的侵略势力。在已经实现了土地改革的老解放区，农夫和农妇得到了土地和农具，得到了政权，得到了自由，并且正在得到改良种子、兴办水利和发展合作社的权利。新解放区的土地改革，很快也就要进行了。以实现全国范围内的土地改革为中心议题的中国人民政治协商会全国委员会正在北京开会，日内即将通过中国新土地改革法草案。这将是中国革命最大的果实。中国农民能获得此伟大的果实，不能不感谢毛主席英明的领导，而秋白和千百万烈士们所流的热血，因此而换得了莫大的代价。在这样的时候，我们纪念秋白，重温秋白在二十多年前对中国农民问题的言论，也觉得安慰了！
