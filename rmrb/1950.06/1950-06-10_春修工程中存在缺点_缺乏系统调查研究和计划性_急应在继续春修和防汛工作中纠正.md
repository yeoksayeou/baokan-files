Xinhua News Agency, June 4th. This year's spring irrigation projects have achieved great results, but there are still various shortcomings in the process, which urgently need to be corrected in future spring repairs and flood control work. These shortcomings are mainly:

First, there is a lack of systematic investigation and research, insufficient understanding of the conditions of various rivers and regions, and the engineering plan is based on rough estimates. Therefore, the work has failed to grasp the key points, resulting in a reversal of priorities. For example, the Huai River did not breach its banks last year; in northern Anhui, only waterlogging due to rain or poor drainage of tributaries inundated 10.94 million mu of land. This year's projects in this area should focus on both restoring dikes and dredging drainage, with dredging drainage being particularly urgently demanded by the masses. However, the local leading organs did not grasp this principle well when formulating the engineering plan. The original plan for the Huai River this year was 7.64 million cubic meters of earthwork for dike restoration, but only 3.7 million cubic meters for dredging. As a result, the areas in northern Anhui that suffered from flooding last year due to poor drainage are still likely to be flooded this year. Another example is the Yongding River in Hebei Province, which is related to the safety of traffic on the Beijing-Tianjin section of the Beining Railway, as well as the lives and property of the people of Beijing, Tianjin, Anci, Liangxiang, Gu'an, Xincheng, Rongcheng, Wuqing, and other counties. Last year, the flood flow at Lugou Bridge was only over 500 cubic meters per second, and individual dike sections were about to overflow. However, the local leading organs only planned 600,000 cubic meters of dike work for the river this year, which is far from the standard for guaranteeing river defense safety.

Second, there is a lack of planning, no calculation of economic benefits, and blind work based solely on subjective demands, which affects the quality of the project or leads to errors in the engineering plan. For example, the Zhengnan Huai Dike project undertaken by the Northern Anhui and Huai River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau was built on silt due to insufficient investigation. Before the project was completed, part of it was washed away on the evening of April 6 due to the spring flood of the Zhe River, resulting in loss of manpower and material resources, and the project was forced to stop. Many regions have planned many dike repair projects, but have not calculated how much farmland these dikes can protect from flooding.

Third, some water conservancy cadres still have a bureaucratic work style. In the preparation and construction process, some areas have failed to effectively and responsibly solve the problems of the migrant workers. For example, in the Jianghuai Dike Restoration Project in northern Anhui, some dike sections failed to properly solve the food and lodging problems of the migrant workers. Some migrant workers dug holes in the dikes for accommodation, and 15 people were killed or injured due to cave-ins in Fengtai County. In the Yellow River Dike Restoration Project in the Liangshan section of the plain, the leaders, without detailed consideration, stipulated that a warehouse should issue 660,000 jin of wages and food in two days, but the warehouse only had one scale and three warehouse keepers. More than 5,000 migrant workers came to collect food in one day. On the first day, the warehouse only issued more than 48,000 jin of grain. As a result, thousands of migrant workers were frozen and hungry for a whole day and night while waiting for the food to be distributed, and 7,800 workdays were missed.

The above-mentioned main shortcomings have been strictly criticized at the National Flood Control Conference, and remedial measures have been studied.

### 春修工程中存在缺点  缺乏系统调查研究和计划性  急应在继续春修和防汛工作中纠正

　　春修工程中存在缺点
    缺乏系统调查研究和计划性   
    急应在继续春修和防汛工作中纠正
    【新华社四日讯】今年的水利春修工程，虽有很大的成绩，但在工程进行中，还存在着各种缺点，急需在今后继续春修及防汛工作中，予以纠正。这些缺点主要是：
    第一，缺乏系统的调查研究，对各河流、各地区情况了解不足，把工程计划建立在粗略的估计上，因而在进行工作中没能掌握重点，形成轻重倒置的现象。如淮河去年并未决口，在皖北仅由于雨涝积水，或支流排水不畅，淹地一千零九十四万亩，今年该区域的工程，应当是复堤与疏浚排水并重，而疏浚排水尤为群众迫切要求。但当地领导机关在制定工程计划时，却没有很好地掌握这个原则。淮河今年原计划复堤土方为七百六十四万公方，疏浚仅三百七十万公方，以致皖北去年因排水不畅遭受水灾的地区，今年仍有大部可能遭受水淹。又如河北省永定河，关系北宁路京津段交通，及京、津二市和安次、良乡、固安、新城、容城、武清等县人民生命财产之安全，去年在芦沟桥洪水流量仅五百多秒公方，个别堤段即将漫溢，但当地领导机关今年仅计划该河堤工六十多万公方，距离保证河防安全的标准甚远。
    第二，缺乏计划性，不计算经济效益，仅凭主观要求，盲目地进行工作，影响了工程质量，或在工程计划上犯了错误。如皖北及淮河水利工程总局举办之正南淮堤工程，由于调查不足，将堤线筑在积淤上，工程尚未完成，即于四月六日晚因渒河春汛水涨，淤泥流动，被冲毁一部分，人力、物力受到损失，工程亦被迫停顿。不少地区计划了很多修堤工程，但没有计算这些堤防究竟能保护多少农田免受水患。
    第三，部分水利工作干部还存在着官僚主义作风。在施工准备及施工过程中，有的地区未能切实负责地解决民工的问题。如皖北江淮复堤工程中，有的堤段因未很好地解决民工的食宿问题，部分民工在堤上挖洞住宿，凤台县即因洞塌伤亡十五人。平原梁山段黄河复堤中，领导人员未经详细考虑，即规定一个仓库两天发工资粮六十六万斤，但该库只有一个秤和三个管库员，领粮民工一天即到五千余人，在第一天库中仅发出四万八千余斤粮食，结果几千民工因等待发粮，冻饿了一昼夜，还误了七千八百余工。
    对于上述主要缺点，全国防汛会议已予以严格的批判，并研究了补救的办法。
