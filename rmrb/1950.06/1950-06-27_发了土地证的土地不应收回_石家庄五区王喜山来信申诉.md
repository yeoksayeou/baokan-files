　　Land with Land Certificates Should Not Be Taken Back
    Letter of Complaint from Wang Xishan, Fifth District, Shijiazhuang
    To the Editor:
    I am Wang Xishan from Xiwang Village, Fifth District, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, and my family's class status is middle peasant. I work as a miner at Yuhua Coal Mine in Yangquan City. When the Japanese devils occupied Shijiazhuang, they built a large parade ground near my village, which occupied two mu of my land. At that time, some land compensation was issued. After the Japanese surrendered, the Kuomintang puppet government leased the land occupied by this parade ground to the original owners for cultivation. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, during the land reform, this part of the land belonging to landlords and rich peasants was distributed to poor peasants, while the land belonging to middle peasants was not touched. My two mu of land were also returned to me for cultivation. This April, I was issued a land certificate. But a few days later, because a canal was built in the village, occupying other people's land, my two mu of land, along with the land certificate, were taken back and given to others as compensation. I went back to the district government to ask for the reason. The district head said, "This is public land. You are now working as a worker outside and don't need the land." I would like to ask the editor, how should this problem be solved?
              Wang Xishan, Yuhua Coal Mine, Hantinggou, Yangquan
    Editor's Note: Judging from the situation described in the letter above, it was wrong to return the two mu of land to Comrade Wang Xishan and issue a land certificate, and then take his land away. We hope that the local district government will re-examine this matter and inform us of the result.

　　发了土地证的土地不应收回
    石家庄五区王喜山来信申诉编辑同志：
    我是河北石家庄五区西王村人，家庭是中农成份。我在阳泉市裕华煤矿当工人。日寇占领石家庄时，在我村附近修了一个大操场，其中占用我的土地二亩，当时也发过一些地价。日寇投降后，国民党伪政府把这个操场所占用的土地都出租给原主耕种。石家庄解放后，土地改革时，这部分土地凡属地主富农的都分配给了贫农，属中农的未动。我的二亩地也归还我种。今年四月间已给我发了土地证。但不几天，因村中修了一条水渠，占用了别人的土地，又把我这二亩地连土地证一并要回去补给了别人。我当时回去找区政府问理由。区长说：“这是公家的地，你现在出外当了工人，用不着土地了。”请问编辑同志，这个问题应如何解决？

    编者按：从上面这封信所叙述的情况看来，当时把那二亩地归还王喜山同志，并发给了土地证，现在又把他的土地拿走了，这种做法是不对的。望当地区政府应重新处理这件事，并将处理结果告诉我们。
