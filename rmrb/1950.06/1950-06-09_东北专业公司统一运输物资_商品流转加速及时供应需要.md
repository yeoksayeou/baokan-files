Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th. After the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government unified the material transportation plans of its affiliated specialized companies, commodity circulation has greatly accelerated, gradually achieving timely supply to meet the production and living needs of the people. Last year, when the specialized companies under the department transferred materials, they were handled separately according to a single system. Due to the lack of scientific organization and meticulous planning for transportation, serious shortcomings such as wasted transportation capacity and increased material consumption occurred in various units. For example, materials allocated from Shenyang to Tonghua and Pulandian in Liaodong Province had to be transported first to the Liaodong Provincial Specialized Company in Andong City, unloaded, stored, and inventoried, and then returned to Shenyang for transshipment to Tonghua and Pulandian. This not only wasted time but also increased the cost of goods. In January of this year, the department established a Transportation Bureau, which, with the active assistance of the Railway Bureau, changed the past decentralized situation to unified and centralized transportation. The allocation of large quantities of materials is now handled by railway transportation, striving to reduce warehousing or even allocate directly without warehousing; small and scattered commodities are also promptly shipped as less-than-carload freight instead of waiting for full carloads as in the past. This has increased the speed of material allocation and reduced the rate of cargo loss. The time for goods arriving from Shanghai has been reduced by half compared to last year; the time for goods shipped from Shenyang to various provinces has also been reduced by half compared to the past.

　　东北专业公司统一运输物资
    商品流转加速及时供应需要
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北人民政府贸易部统一所属各专业公司的物资运输计划后，商品流转已大为加速，逐渐做到及时供应人民生产与生活的需要。去年该部所属各专业公司调运物资时，系按单一系统分别处理，各单位因对运输缺乏科学组织及周密计划，发生浪费运输力、增加物资耗损等严重缺点。如由沈阳分拨辽东省通化、普兰店等地的物资，须先运到在安东市的辽东省专业公司，卸车入库清点后，再返回沈阳转往通化、普兰店，不但浪费时间，且使货物成本增加。今年一月间该部成立了运输局，在铁路局积极协助下，改变过去的分散状况，转为统一集中运输。大批物资的分配皆由铁路转运，力求减少入库，甚或不入库而直接分拨；零星商品也由以往的等待整车装发转为及时零担托运。这样就提高了物资调拨速度，减低了货物损耗率。现由上海来货的时间已比去年缩短一半；从沈阳运往各省的商品也比以往减少一半时间。
