　　After the proposal to expel the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representatives was rejected
    Representatives from Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia withdrew from the International Labor Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] The International Labor Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations, has been holding its 33rd International Labor Conference (the organization's general assembly) in Geneva since June 7th. The delegations from Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia proposed on the first day of the meeting that the representatives of the Kuomintang clique be expelled; this proposal was rejected by the US and British representatives using their majority. The three delegations immediately withdrew from the meeting. According to a Polish News Agency report on the 20th, the three delegations have left Geneva and returned home because the Credentials Committee of the conference finally decided to retain the so-called "representatives" of the Kuomintang. Before returning home, they issued a joint statement, reiterating that their governments will not accept any resolutions passed by this conference or other bodies of the International Labor Organization until the Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China's request to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang clique is accepted.

    波、匈、捷三国代表退出国际劳工大会
    【新华社二十三日讯】联合国专门机构国际劳工组织，自六月七日起在日内瓦举行第三十三届国际劳工大会（该组织之代表大会）。波兰、匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克三国的代表团，曾于第一日会议上提出建议，要求开除国民党集团的代表；此项建议竟遭美英代表利用多数加以否决，三国代表团当即退出会议。据波兰通讯社二十日报道：三国代表团由于大会资格审查委员会最后竟决定保留国民党的所谓“代表”，已离日内瓦返国，在返国前并发表联合声明，再次宣布：在中华人民共和国外交部长关于驱逐国民党集团代表的要求被接受之前，他们的政府将不接受此次大会或国际劳工组织其他机构所通过的任何决议。
