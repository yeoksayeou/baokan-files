　　World Peace Movement Fortnight
    ——June 6th to June 19th
    Signature Campaign Advances
    Responding to the call of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council's London meeting, peace-loving people in many countries have enthusiastically launched a friendly competition of peace signatures, resulting in even more brilliant achievements and a more rapid increase in the number of signatures. As of the beginning of June, the incomplete statistics of signatures in various countries are as follows:
    China                     111,239,713
    Albania                     400,000

    Czechoslovakia     9,482,422

    Poland                    18,000,000

    Austria                     500,000
  Protest Against Unreasonable Summons of Mrs. Gordon
    Following the persecution of Frédéric Joliot-Curie, President of the World Peace Council, the French government unreasonably summoned Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, on May 26th, because she led French women to launch a peace struggle and opposed the colonial war of aggression against Vietnam. The Women's International Democratic Federation immediately notified people around the world that day to protest to the French government and demand the revocation of this absurd accusation. Democratic women's groups from various countries, as well as peace-loving and democratic people around the world, also sent letters and telegrams to condemn this reactionary measure by the French authorities and to express their condolences to Mrs. Cotton. On June 7th, Romanian working women held a protest rally in Bucharest.
  Peace Movements in Various Countries
    China—The signature campaign has been extended from cities to rural areas and is being further expanded.
    Poland—The signature campaign has ended victoriously, with signatures reaching four-fifths of the total population. The Polish National Committee for the Defense of Peace held a conference on the 17th to celebrate the great achievements of the signature campaign.
    Romania—The signature campaign ended victoriously on June 5th. A grand celebration was held on the same day.
    Germany—At the beginning of June, young people in Berlin initiated a friendly signature-collection competition with young people in Paris and Rome.
    Around June 10th, soldiers of the American occupation forces in Bavaria and Hesse, West Germany, and a large number of African-American soldiers stationed in Mainz signed their names, indicating their unwillingness to serve the war-mongers.
    United States—The newly established "Peace Information Center" and the "American Youth Committee for World Peace Appeal" are conducting a campaign to collect five million signatures in various places. According to a TASS report on June 9th: the American Evangelical Church and other groups recently passed a resolution in Minnesota, demanding a ban on the Cold War and condemning the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.
    Italy—On June 17th, the Italian Peace Committee announced that the mayors of eighteen cities, including Genoa, Turin, and Venice, sent letters to the mayors of major cities around the world, urging them to support the Peace Appeal on behalf of the citizens of their respective cities.
    Austria—On June 10th, Austrian peace supporters, despite the Austrian government's resolution against the peace movement passed on May 23rd and other various obstacles, held the first meeting of the All-Austria Peace Conference in Vienna. The Austrian Youth League also held a peace relay race.
    Greece—At the beginning of June, peace supporters established underground organizations of the Peace Committee in Athens, under reactionary rule, to launch a peace signature campaign.
    Japan—Following the illegal "purge" of all Central Committee members of the Japanese Communist Party on June 6th, the reactionary authorities of the United States and Japan have continued to persecute Japanese peace-loving patriots. On June 13th, the reactionary authorities prohibited the screening of the film "Listen, the Ocean is Calling!" sponsored by the War Dead Student Memorial Association. This film depicts Japanese students opposing world war and arrested students distributing peace leaflets. However, Japanese students are still collecting peace signatures at Shibuya Station in Tokyo and other places.
