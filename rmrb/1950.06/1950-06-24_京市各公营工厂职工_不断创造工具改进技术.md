Beijing Public Factory Workers
Constantly Create Tools and Improve Technology
Administrative leaders in some factories underestimate rationalization proposals and fail to provide timely assistance and encouragement for inventions and innovations, which urgently needs improvement.
[Report from this newspaper] According to Workers' Daily, workers' inventions, rationalization proposals, and technological improvements in public factories in the capital are increasingly prevalent in various factories. Preliminary investigations show that the trolleybus company's repair shop had 28 technological improvements, 13 rationalization proposals, and 1 invention from January to May this year. The Shijingshan Power Plant has had 72 rationalization proposals. The Agricultural Machinery Branch Factory had 41 tool improvements alone from October last year to March this year. Model figures are also emerging in large numbers. Shi Chongzhen of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant used waste iron and surplus gas instead of coal for burning, saving 1,000 tons of coal per month and reducing the cost of each ton of pig iron by 20 catties. He also purified iron slag, producing an additional 600 kilograms of pig iron per day. Zhu Lin of the Automobile Company created the May 1st model gas vehicle, reducing costs by one-fifth. Liu Mengxing of the Trolleybus Company contributed three technological improvements and one rationalization proposal in succession. Luo Wenzhong alone made six rationalization proposals. Lu Yuntai also made three rationalization proposals and two technological improvements. Hou Deyuan of the Telecommunications Bureau invented the Type 88 and Type T crossovers, reducing crosstalk and leakage, saving more than 1.8 million catties of rice in manpower and materials per year. Wang Changpei and Liu Wenru of the Agricultural Machinery Factory created a waterwheel pipe machine, completing a month's task in half a month. A rationalization proposal by Zhu Zhimo and Zhou Hongsheng of the Shijingshan Power Plant saved more than 500,000 catties of rice. Such examples are too numerous to mention.
When Beijing was first liberated, some workers did not believe in their own wisdom and strength and still believed that only foreign goods were good. Now it is different. When there are difficulties, they find ways to overcome them themselves. Not only are past wastes useful today, past records have been broken, but also things that China has never made before can now be made, and some problems that could not be solved for decades have now been solved. Guo Manyi and Zhang Honglun of the Telecommunications Bureau created the "No. 13 G Impedance Tester" to improve work efficiency, which is half the cost of the Japanese "No. 201" and No. 4 "TA," and the work efficiency is four times higher. The other foreign goods currently in use do not have as wide a range of applications as their creations. Antenna insulators have always been imported from foreign countries. Qiu Qicai, Li Derui, and Factory Director You Qidong of the newly built Glass Factory finally succeeded in manufacturing them after several experiments, which are better than Japanese products. They also made glass oil eyes. Trolleybuses of the Trolleybus Company have been breaking down every rainy season for nearly 20 years. Since the company adopted the suggestions of two workers, Lu Yuntai and Deng Faxi, in April and installed resistance water baffles and motor water baffles, the problem has been solved. During the "May Day" holiday this year, all the vehicles equipped with water baffles did not break down in the rain. In the future, trolleybuses can still run as usual even in half a foot of water.
In the process of workers' inventions or proposing rationalization proposals, many leading comrades have adopted a bureaucratic attitude and intentionally or unintentionally "poured cold water" on the workers' enthusiasm. For example, Deng Faxi of the Trolleybus Company proposed the water baffle method at the first waterproofing meeting in February this year. Because the administration did not pay attention to it and did not adopt it, it caused the loss of 24 vehicles damaged in the heavy rain on April 15. Xu Jiaxing of the Automobile Company proposed the transformation of the coal stove before Zhu Lin transformed the coal stove, but the company's administration never paid attention to it. Wu Zelin, deputy director of the planning office of the Automobile Company, said to worker Wei Xiangshan, who was doing engine test bench: "There is nothing rare about it." Many factories are stingy, do not reward or are reluctant to reward achievements. The administrative负责人 of individual factories even said: "Workers are the masters of the country, and it is only natural to be enthusiastic about production. If they still need to be rewarded, it means that their awareness is not high." Zhu Jinglin and Song Wenhao of the Construction Bureau manufactured a rotary screen, which can save more than 20,000 catties of millet per year. The administration only rewarded them with a towel, a bar of soap, a not-very-good fountain pen, and a notebook. After the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant transformed the gas scrubber, it saved more than 1,700 catties of rice per day, and more than 600,000 catties per year, but the administration only rewarded the three people who made the suggestion with 250 catties of rice. When the Trolleybus Company issued awards in the spring of this year, the highest individual award was 35 catties of rice, and the lowest was as little as 6 catties, with a difference of only 2 catties between each level. And the awards for November and December of last year were only evaluated in March. On the 16th of this month, the staff and worker representatives' meeting of the Car and Road Company discussed the draft reward plan for January to April. Some factories' regulations do not conform to the principle of more work, more pay, and some do not conform to the principle of excess reward. Among the fifteen factories and enterprises of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Power Plant, Trolleybus Company, Automobile Company, Automobile Repair Shop, Telecommunications Bureau, Construction Bureau, Water Company, Clothing Factory, Machine General Factory, Branch Factory No. 2, Agricultural Machinery General Factory, Mentougou Coal Mine, Beijing Branch of Tianjin Railway Bureau, and Fengtai Bridge Factory, there are forty-one more prominent inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals. Because the leaders of factories and enterprises are unwilling to reward, or have been "investigating," twenty-four items have not been given any rewards so far. Some have been delayed again and again on the pretext of not having unified regulations and no production quotas, and have failed to give workers praise and rewards in a timely manner.
If appropriate rewards are not given to workers' enthusiasm, the result is certainly very bad. In some factories, because there has been no reward, the workers said: "I work hard or I don't work hard, it's the same." After the Xinhua Printing Factory established a management committee, most of the opinions raised by the workers were about management system and rewards. Some units only rewarded a few of the best people, and the workers said: "If only a few of the best people are rewarded (even so, the rewards are not completely appropriate), the workers will lose energy in the middle of the month when they see that they can't squeeze into the top few."

　　京市各公营工厂职工
    不断创造工具改进技术
    若干工厂行政负责人员轻视合理化建议，对创造发明未能及时给予帮助与鼓励，亟应改进。
    【本报讯】据工人日报消息：首都公营工厂工人的创造发明、合理化建议、技术改进，已普遍在各厂日渐增多起来。据初步调查，电车公司修造厂，今年一至五月间就有技术改进二十八件，合理化建议十三件，创造发明一件。石景山发电厂的合理化建议，已经出现七十二件。农业机械一分厂从去年十月到今年三月，只工具改进一项，就有四十一件。模范人物也大批地涌现。石景山钢铁厂石重珍利用废铁剩余煤气代替煤烧，每月省煤一千吨，使每吨生铁降低成本二十斤。他又使铁渣纯化，每天可多出六百公斤生铁。汽车公司朱临创造了五一式煤气车，使成本降低了五分之一。电车公司刘梦星曾接连贡献了三件技术改进，一项合理化建议。罗文忠一人就提了六项合理化建议。卢运泰也提了三项合理化建议，作了二个技术改进。电信局侯德原发明八八式、Ｔ式交叉，减少了串话、漏话，一年可节省人力、物力折米一百八十多万斤。农业机械厂王长佩、刘文儒等创造了水车管子机，一个月的任务，半月内就完成了。石景山发电厂朱致墨、周洪声的一项合理化建议就省下米五十多万斤。像这样的例子是不胜枚举的。
    在北京刚一解放时，有些职工不相信自己的智慧与力量，还迷信只有外国货好的说法。现在不然，有了困难，自己就想法克服。不仅过去的废物今天有用了，过去的纪录打破了，而且中国从来没造过的东西，也能造了，几十年来不能解决的问题现在有一些也解决了。电信局郭曼一、张鸿伦为了提高工作效率，创造了“十三号Ｇ阻抗测试器”，比日本的“二○一号”和四号“ＴＡ”成本低一半，工作效率提高了四倍。现在用的其他几种外国货，还没有他们的创造品适用的范围大。天线绝缘子，一向是从外国进口，新建玻璃厂的工人邱起才、李德瑞和厂长尤其侗，经过数次试验，终于制造成功，比日本货好。他们并制成了玻璃油眼。电车公司的电车，近二十年来，每到雨季就要坏车。自四月间该公司采纳了卢运泰、邓发熙两个工人的建议，装置了阻力挡水板和马达挡水板之后，问题就解决了。今年“五一”节那样的雨，凡安装有挡水板的车，全没有坏。今后雨水深及半尺，电车仍可照样行驶。
    工人在创造发明过程中，或提出合理化建议时，不少的领导同志采取了官僚主义的态度，有意无意的对工人的积极性“泼了冷水”。如：电车公司邓发熙，在今年二月第一次防水会议上，就提出了挡水板的办法。因为行政不加重视，没采用，造成了四月十五日大雨坏车二十四部的损失。汽车公司徐嘉兴早在朱临改造石炭炉以前就提了石炭炉的改造建议，但该公司行政上始终没理。汽车公司企划室副主任吴泽霖对工人魏香山做引擎试验台，却说：“没什么希罕。”不少厂子小手小脚，有功不奖或舍不得奖，个别厂子的行政负责人还说：“工人是国家主人，生产积极理所当然，如果还要奖励，那是觉悟不高。”建设局朱景林、宋文浩制造了回转筛，每年可省两万多斤小米，行政上只奖了毛巾一条，肥皂一块，不很好的自来水笔一支，笔记本一个。石景山钢铁厂改造洗气机后，每天省米一千七百多斤，一年能省六十多万斤，可是行政上对建议的三个人只奖了二百五十斤米。电车公司今年春季发奖，个人奖最高的是三十五斤米，最低的少到六斤，每一级也只差二斤。并且是三月份才评了去年十一、二月的奖。本月十六日，车路职工代表会才讨论一至四月的奖励草案。有的厂子规定的条例不合乎多劳多得的原则，有的不合乎超额奖励的原则，石景山钢铁厂、发电厂、电车公司、汽车公司、汽车修配厂、电信局、建设局、自来水公司、被服厂、机器总厂、二分厂、农业机械总厂、门头沟煤矿、天津铁路局北京分局和丰台桥梁厂十五个工厂企业中，比较突出的创造发明、技术改进、合理化建议就有四十一件。因为工厂企业领导者不愿奖励，或者一直在“调查”，所以至今还有二十四件没有给过任何奖励。有的借口没有统一条例，没有生产定额，一拖再拖，未能及时给工人表扬与奖励。
    对于工人积极性，不给予适当的奖励，结果当然是很坏的。有的工厂，因为一直没有奖，工人说：“我好好干也是这样，不好好干也是这样。”新华印刷厂成立管委会，工人提的意见中大部分是管理制度和奖励方面的。有的单位只奖了几个最好的人，工人说：“如果只奖几个最好的人（就是这样，也还奖的不完全适当），工人在月中一看挤不到头上几名就泄劲了。”
