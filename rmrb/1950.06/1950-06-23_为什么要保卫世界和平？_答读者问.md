　　Why Defend World Peace?
    Answering Readers' Questions Special Edition Editorial Board for Defending World Peace:
    I have a question I can't figure out and would like you to answer it. I have always had full confidence in the power of the world's people. After reading the reports of Molotov and Malenkov not long ago, this confidence was greatly strengthened, but a problem also arose. Molotov and Malenkov both said in their reports: if imperialism dares to launch a war, it would mean the destruction of the entire capitalist system. I remember that many articles in China have also talked about this. In that case, wouldn't it be better if a third world war broke out sooner? Wouldn't this allow the capitalist system to die earlier and the whole of humanity to be liberated sooner? Why do we have to oppose a third world war?
           Reader Yifeng
Yifeng Comrade:
    We believe that if imperialism dares to risk launching a third world war, the result will indeed be its own demise, and there is no doubt about this. Historical experience has already proven this. For example, the First World War launched by imperialism led to the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, liberating one-sixth of the earth's land first. Another example is the Second World War launched by imperialism, which promoted the establishment of people's democratic regimes in many countries in Central and Southeastern Europe, resulting in the victory of the great Chinese people and the climax of other Eastern national liberation movements, making the peace and democracy camp a invincible force of more than one billion people. Today, when the forces of peace and democracy are unprecedentedly strong, if imperialism makes a desperate attempt to launch a third world war, it will mean the end not only of individual capitalist countries, but of the entire capitalist world. Is there any room for doubt about this? Therefore, it is just a pipe dream for imperialism and its running dogs to rely on a third world war to turn themselves around. We must not think that our active opposition to wars of aggression is because we are frightened by the war-mongers sharpening their knives. This is one aspect of the matter.
    However, war is still opposed by the people of the world, because war will inevitably cause great destruction and casualties, and the laboring people will be the first to suffer.
    First of all, a third world war means the death of tens of millions of peaceful people and the destruction of a large number of peaceful cities and property and materials. This is an incalculable and irreparable disaster for the people of the world. For example, according to the calculations of Soviet economist Leontiev, the First World War cost 200 billion US dollars and resulted in the death of 10 million people. The Second World War cost approximately 1 trillion US dollars and resulted in the death of approximately 50 million people. In order to avoid this great disaster, we should try our best to stop this war of aggression. We must not use one-sided and naive ideas to solve such a serious problem concerning the lives of tens of millions of people.
    The people's democratic countries of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Asia engaged in peaceful construction, including our country which is about to be fully liberated and enter peaceful construction, urgently need a peaceful environment worldwide to concentrate their efforts to heal the wounds of war and restore and develop production in order to build a prosperous and happy life. But war will destroy the peaceful construction of these countries and postpone the time for the people of these countries to move towards a comfortable and happy life, thus violating the basic requirements and highest interests of the people of these countries.
    Of course, socialist countries and people's democratic countries are not afraid of war, but they are especially not afraid of peace, and only imperialist countries are afraid of peace. This is because socialist systems and people's democratic systems are absolutely certain to defeat capitalist systems through peaceful competition. Everyone knows that the social and economic systems of socialist countries and people's democratic countries no longer have the possibility of crisis. Peaceful development is absolutely beneficial to them, allowing them to become more prosperous and stronger in peaceful development. The astonishing speed of the Soviet socialist economic development over the past thirty years has proven the absolute superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system. However, the capitalist system itself contains insurmountable contradictions. It is currently on a downward slope, and economic and political crises are deepening day by day. In peaceful competition, they will be more difficult and weaker, and will therefore be completely defeated in peaceful competition. This is why they are afraid of peace and are painstakingly trying to undermine peace.
    From this, it can be seen that resolutely opposing a third world war and striving for world peace in order to defeat the capitalist system in peaceful competition; and if the imperialists dare to risk launching a new war, preparing to defeat the capitalist system in war - this is the direction of struggle for the people of the world.

### 为什么要保卫世界和平？  答读者问

　　为什么要保卫世界和平？
    答读者问保卫世界和平特刊编者：
    我有一个问题想不通，请你们予以解答。我一向对世界人民的力量有着充分的信心，当我不久以前读了莫洛托夫、马林科夫的报告后，更使这种信心大为增强，但是问题亦就跟着发生了。莫洛托夫、马林科夫的报告中都说：假如帝国主义敢于发动战争，那就意味着整个资本主义制度的毁灭。我记得中国也有不少文章这样谈过。既然这样，第三次世界大战早些爆发不是好得很吗？这不是可以使资本主义制度提早死亡，而使全人类提早翻身吗？为什么我们又要反对第三次世界大战呢？   
           读者逸峰逸峰同志：
    我们认为：如果帝国主义胆敢冒险发动第三次世界大战，其结果的确是自取灭亡，这是毫无疑问的。因为历史的经验已经给予了证明。例如由帝国主义发动的第一次世界大战，造成了苏联十月社会主义革命的胜利，使地球上六分之一的土地首先得到了解放。又如由帝国主义发动的第二次世界大战，促成了中欧和东南欧许多国家内人民民主政权的建立，造成了伟大中国人民的胜利，和其他东方民族解放运动的高潮，使和平民主阵营壮大成为拥有十万万以上的一支无敌大军。在和平民主力量空前强大的今天，如果帝国主义孤注一掷地冒险发动第三次世界大战，那将意味着不只是个别资本主义国家的末日，而是整个资本主义世界的末日，这难道还有怀疑的余地吗？因此，帝国主义及其走狗想依靠第三次世界大战来翻身，这不过是在做梦。决不可以认为，我们之积极反对侵略战争，是因为被战争贩子的磨刀霍霍所吓坏了。这是事情的一方面。
    但是战争仍然是全世界人民所反对的，因为战争毕竟会造成极大的破坏和伤亡，遭受灾难的首先是劳动人民。
    首先，第三次世界大战意味着千千万万和平人民的死亡，大量和平城市和财产、物资的毁灭。这对于全世界人民来说，是一个无法计算、难于弥补的大灾难。例如，根据苏联经济学家列昂节夫的计算，第一次世界大战耗费为二千亿美元，死亡的为一千万人。第二次世界大战的耗费约达一万亿美元，死亡的约五千万人。为了避免这一大灾难，就应该尽可能制止这一侵略战争。我们决不能以片面的天真的想法，来解决这样关系着数以千万计的生命的严重问题。
    从事和平建设的苏联、东欧和亚洲的人民民主国家，包括即将全部解放并进入和平建设的我国，都急切需要一个世界范围的和平环境，好集中努力，来医治战争的创伤，恢复和发展生产，以建立繁荣和幸福的生活。但是战争就将破坏这些国家的和平建设，推迟这些国家的人民走向康乐和幸福生活的时间，因而违反了这些国家人民的基本要求和最高利益。
    当然，社会主义国家和人民民主国家是不害怕战争的，但是它们尤其不害怕和平，只有帝国主义国家才害怕和平。这是因为，社会主义制度和人民民主制度用和平的竞赛来战胜资本主义制度，是有绝对把握的。谁都知道，社会主义国家与人民民主国家的社会经济制度，已经没有发生危机的可能，和平发展对它们绝对有利，使它们能在和平发展中更趋繁荣与壮大。三十多年来苏联社会主义经济发展的惊人速度，证明了社会主义经济制度对资本主义经济制度具有绝对的优越性。但是，资本主义制度本身，却包含着不可克服的矛盾，目前它正在向下坡路滚，经济与政治的危机正在日益加深，在和平竞赛中，它们将更加困难，更加削弱，从而在和平竞赛中完全被打败。这就是它们害怕和平，处心积虑地要破坏和平的原因。
    由此可见，坚决反对第三次世界大战，争取世界和平，以便在和平竞赛中战胜资本主义制度；而如果帝国主义者竟敢冒险发动新战争，就准备在战争中战胜资本主义制度：——这才是全世界人民奋斗的方向。
