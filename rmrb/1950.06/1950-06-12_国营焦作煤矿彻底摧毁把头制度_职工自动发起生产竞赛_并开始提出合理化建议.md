　　State-owned Jiaozuo Coal Mine Thoroughly Destroys the Ba Tou System
    Workers Automatically Initiate Production Emulation and Begin to Propose Rationalization Suggestions
    [Our Newspaper, Jiaozuo] The anti-Ba Tou movement in the state-owned Jiaozuo Coal Mine has been widely launched throughout the mining area. The feudal Ba Tou system of the mine for the past fifty years will soon be completely eliminated, and a democratic enterprise management system is gradually being established. Ba Tou who have committed heinous crimes have been handed over to the government for handling, and general Ba Tou elements are being reformed through labor. Active elements among the miners have been promoted to leadership positions.
    The mine's anti-Ba Tou movement began in March of this year. First, the situation of the Ba Tou was investigated, and active elements were selected from the workers to fill deputy positions such as "team leader" and "district leader," so that the workers gradually became familiar with the business of leading production. Before the official start of the movement, a general meeting of Party and League members was held, and training classes for active elements were held to explain the principles and policies and enhance the workers' confidence in managing the factory themselves. At the same time, a forum for staff members was held, putting forward the slogan "Workers and staff unite to oppose Ba Tou." The leadership focused its main efforts on mobilizing the workers to conduct grievance-airing and reasoning struggles to further enlighten class consciousness. Various mines also convened workers' representative meetings to establish factory-level factory management committees, fully implementing the spirit of democracy in handling the Ba Tou issue. The big Ba Tou Jin Peilin, who was hated by the masses, was handed over to the government for legal action, and the remaining thirty-odd Ba Tou were dismissed and allowed to participate in above-ground labor for education and reform.
    After the abolition of the Ba Tou system, the mine's workers put forward the slogan of "Safe Production Month" in May and launched an emulation movement. The efficiency of the No. 2 plant's underground operations has increased from 0.9041 tons to 0.9697 tons. Safety work has also improved, and the rate of work-related injuries has gradually decreased. Workers have begun to put forward rationalization proposals. For example, the workers of the No. 2 plant put forward 79 safe production proposals at the workers' congress. The next day, the factory director answered them one by one, stipulated the dates for handling the proposals that could be realized, and the workers selected an inspection team to supervise the implementation.

　　国营焦作煤矿彻底摧毁把头制度
    职工自动发起生产竞赛  并开始提出合理化建议
    【本报焦作讯】国营焦作煤矿的反把头运动，已在整个矿区广泛展开。该矿五十年来的封建把头制度即将彻底肃清，民主的企业管理制度正在逐步建立。罪大恶极的把头已被送交政府处理，一般把头分子正在劳动中改造。矿工中的积极分子已被提拔到领导岗位上来。
    该矿反把头运动，从今年三月份开始。首先调查把头的情况，并从工人中选拔积极分子，充任“领班”、“领区”等副职，使工人逐渐熟悉领导生产的业务。运动正式开始以前，又召开了党团员大会，举办积极分子训练班，讲明方针政策，提高工人自己管理工厂的信心。同时，召开职员座谈会，提出“职工团结反对把头”的口号。领导方面以主要力量，发动工人进行诉苦说理斗争，进一步启发阶级觉悟。各矿又召开了工人代表会，成立厂一级的工厂管委会，在处理把头问题时，充分贯彻民主精神。把群众痛恨的大把头靳佩林送交政府法办，把其余三十余名把头撤职，让他们参加井上劳动，进行教育改造。
    该矿职工于废除把头制后，即于五月份提出“安全生产月”的口号，发动了竞赛运动。二厂井下效率已由零点九○四一吨增至零点九六九七吨。保安工作亦有改进，公伤率已逐渐减少。工人开始提出合理化建议，如二厂工人，在工人大会上提出七十九条安全生产建议，第二天厂长即一一答复，对可能实现的建议规定了办理的日期，并由工人选出检查小组，监督执行。
