　　The Steel Regiment
    ——A Record of the Construction of the Manas Bridge
    Zhao Wenjie

    The Manas River Bridge is completed. The heroic and invincible soldiers of a certain engineering regiment of the Xinjiang Military Region have won unparalleled honor in the cause of the country's peaceful construction.

    The Manas River is located in the territory of Suilai County, 144 kilometers away from Dihua. The Northwest International Highway trunk line from Lanzhou to Horgos on the Sino-Soviet border passes over this mighty river. In 1945, the people of the Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan regions ignited the flame of national liberation to resist the dark and reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The war spread like wildfire towards Dihua. Zhu Shaoliang, terrified and at a loss, ordered the burning of the bridge over the Manas River in an attempt to prevent the eastward advance of the Three Districts' forces. From then on, the forces of the Three Districts and the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek army held each other across the river until the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, a period of five years.

    After the complete liberation of the Northwest region, the People's Liberation Army actively responded to Chairman Mao's call and launched an enthusiastic production and construction movement. On November 25, 1949, 650 soldiers from four companies of a certain engineering regiment of the Xinjiang garrison accepted the task of building the Manas Bridge. Led by Regiment Commander Yin Baoren, the soldiers, as if accepting a combat mission, marched to the banks of the Manas River in the severe winter snow.

    The engineering regiment is a steel regiment that has been tested in war. In the long march westward, they acted at the forefront of the battle. They had built the Yellow River Bridge, the Wei River Bridge, and the Tao River Bridge with unparalleled courage, and opened up the Qilian Mountains. A seven-day task was completed in three days, ensuring the smooth westward advance of the army to annihilate the Hu-Ma bandit troops. Now they are participating in the country's peaceful construction with unparalleled courage.

    In the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius, the soldiers of the engineering regiment braved the wind and snow, crossed the Tianshan Mountains, which are as high as 2,000 meters, to cut and transport large trees in valleys 50 to 60 kilometers away. The snow in the valleys was up to the waist. The soldiers set off from the banks of the Manas River in the morning, arrived in the valley at dusk, and used the sliding force of the snow to drag the trees back overnight. Six hundred and fifty soldiers, day after day for sixty days, transported back 5,500 large trees, eight to nine meters long and forty to fifty centimeters in diameter. The most arduous part of the bridge construction work was ice breaking and water drainage. The Manas River is about 240 meters wide, and the river surface was frozen with a meter-thick layer of ice, and under the ice was a meter-deep flowing water. When the air compressor was turned on, the soldiers lit bonfires on the river bank day and night, and automatically jumped into the river to drain water, reduce the water level, so as to build the bridge foundation. In the arduous work of transporting wood and breaking ice, some soldiers were frostbitten, and some were injured by trees. However, they did not fear or retreat. They remembered what General Wang Zhen said at the mobilization meeting: "Comrades! We were not afraid under the enemy's guns and artillery fire. Comrades! We should be even braver in the severe cold and snow. We must build this bridge. We must complete this construction task. We must maintain the tenacious fighting spirit of the People's Army." This is courage, this is confidence, and under the encouragement of General Wang Zhen, 650 soldiers completed the task of transporting wood and breaking ice and draining water on February 25, 1950, and made all the preparations. The time was exactly three months. From February 26, 650 soldiers turned into ironworkers and carpenters, and officially began to build the bridge. Under the guidance of collective wisdom, the bridge foundation and bridge were quickly built. On April 15, a brand-new bridge appeared on the Manas River. The whole bridge has sixteen holes, 240 meters long and 8.5 meters wide. On the sidewalks on both sides of the bridge, there are solid and beautiful railings, and heavy trucks safely tested past the bridge.

    The Manas Bridge, which had been burned by Zhu Shaoliang's bandits for six years, was completely completed! The construction time was four months and twenty days, completing the planned six-month construction plan ahead of schedule. Forty-one special-class meritorious personnel and 107 first-class meritorious personnel emerged in this construction project, and were rewarded by the government and praised by the people.

    On April 23, the completion ceremony of the Manas Bridge was held. Bao Erhan, Chairman of the People's Government of Xinjiang Province, and Saifuding, Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region, both went to the banks of the Manas River to attend this grand ceremony. Chairman Bao Erhan made a vivid comparison in his speech. He said: "In the past, the Kuomintang reactionary government also fantasized about repairing this bridge. Their employed engineers calculated and said that it would take two years and 125,000 silver dollars, and it could only carry ten tons after it was built. Today, the People's Liberation Army soldiers have really built this bridge, and the time used is only four months and twenty days, and the cost is only equivalent to 90,000 silver dollars, but the carrying capacity has been increased to 25 tons. This is truly a great miracle."

    This great miracle shows the essence of the People's Army's love for the motherland and the power of the great working people. (Reprinted from the Northwest Mass Daily, May 3)

    ——玛纳斯大桥修建记
    赵闻捷
    玛纳斯河上的大桥落成了。新疆军区工兵某团英勇无敌的战士们，在祖国和平建设的事业上，又赢得了崇高无比的荣誉。
    玛纳斯河位于绥来县境，距离迪化一百四十四公里。由兰州至中苏边境霍尔果斯的西北国际公路干线，便从这条巨流上通过。一九四五年，伊宁、塔城、阿山三区人民，为着反抗蒋匪黑暗反动统治，燃起民族解放之火。战争以燎原之势燃向迪化。朱匪绍良惊慌失措，下令焚毁玛纳斯河上的大桥，企图阻挡三区人民力量东进。从那时起，三区人民力量便和蒋匪反动军队隔河相持，直到新疆和平解放，时达五年之久。
    西北地区全部解放后，人民解放军积极响应毛主席的号召，展开了热烈的生产建设运动。一九四九年十一月二十五日，新疆驻军工兵某团四个连队六百五十名战士，接受了修建玛纳斯大桥的任务。战士们由团长尹保仁率领，如同接受了战斗任务一样，在严冬的风雪中，开赴玛纳斯河畔。
    工兵某团是久经战争考验的钢铁的团。在西进的万里长征中，他们行动在战斗的最前列。他们曾以无比的勇敢，抢架过黄河大桥、渭河大桥、洮河大桥，开辟过祁连山小道。七天的任务三天完成，保证了大军顺利西进，追歼胡马匪军。现在他们又以无比的勇敢，参加祖国的和平建设了。
    在摄氏零下二十度的严寒中，工兵某团的战士们冒着风雪，翻过高达二千公尺的天山，到五六十公里以外的山谷中砍伐与拖运大树。山谷中积雪没及腰部。战士们早晨从玛纳斯河畔出发，黄昏到达山谷，利用雪的滑力，连夜将树拖回。六百五十名战士，六十天如一日，运回了长达八、九公尺，直径四、五十公分的五千五百根大树。架桥工作中最艰苦的是打冰排水。玛纳斯河宽约二百四十公尺，河面上冻结了一公尺厚的冰，冰下面又奔流着一公尺深的水。当气压机开动时，战士们不分昼夜在河畔上烧起野火，自动地跳进河中排水，减低水位，以便架设桥基。在拖运木料与打冰的艰苦工作中，有些战士被冰雪冻坏了，有的被树木碰伤了。但是，他们没有畏惧，更没有退却。他们记起王震将军在动员会上的话：“同志们！在敌人的枪炮火网下，我们没有畏惧。同志们！在严寒的风雪下，我们更应勇敢。我们一定要架起这座大桥。一定要完成这个建设任务。我们一定要保持着人民军队顽强的战斗精神。”这就是勇气，这就是信心，六百五十名战士在王震将军的鼓舞下，于一九五零年二月二十五日，完成了拖运木料和打冰排水的任务，做好了一切准备工作，时间恰恰是三个月。从二月二十六日起，六百五十名战士又转为铁工木工，正式进行架桥。在集体智慧的指导下，桥基桥梁很快修建起来。四月十五日，一座崭新的大桥，出现在玛纳斯河上。全桥共十六孔，长二百四十公尺，宽八·五公尺。桥下两旁的人行道上，围着坚固而美丽的栏杆，载重汽车从桥上安全的试行过去。
    被朱匪绍良焚毁六年之久的玛纳斯大桥全部完工了！修建时间共四个月零二十天，提前完成了预定六个月的修建计划。在这次修建工程中涌现的四十一名特等功臣，一百零七名甲等功臣，受到政府的奖励，人民的歌颂。
    四月二十三日，玛纳斯大桥举行落成典礼，新疆省人民政府鲍尔汉主席、新疆军区赛福鼎副司令员，均亲赴玛纳斯河畔参加此一盛典。鲍尔汉主席在致词中有一段生动的对比，他说：“过去国民党反动政府也曾幻想过修复这座大桥，他们御用的工程师们算来算去，说是需要二年时间，十二万五千银元，修成后只能载重十吨。今天人民解放军战士真的修成了这座大桥，而所用的时间只四个月零二十天，经费只合九万银元，载重量却提高至二十五吨，这真是一个伟大的奇迹。”
    这个伟大的奇迹，显示着人民军队热爱祖国的本质和伟大劳动人民的力量。（转载自五月三日西北群众日报）
