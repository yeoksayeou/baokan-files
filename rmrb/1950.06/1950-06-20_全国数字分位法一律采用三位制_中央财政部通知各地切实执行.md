　　The National Numerical Grouping Method Should Uniformly Adopt the Three-Digit System
    The Central Ministry of Finance Notifies All Regions to Implement It Conscientiously
    [From This Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, in the past, the numerical grouping methods were not consistent across the country. Some used three-digit grouping, and some used four-digit grouping. This not only made it inconvenient to read but also easily caused errors in numerical consolidation calculations. It issued a notice to all levels of institutions across the country in April of this year, stipulating that numerical grouping should uniformly adopt the three-digit system. Recently, as some local agencies are still using the four-digit system, the ministry specifically re-issued a notice on the 14th of this month, stipulating that numerical grouping should uniformly adopt the three-digit system (for example: 34,508,236,00), in order to achieve national uniformity and be in line with international practice. The notice has been issued on the 14th of this month, and it is hoped that government agencies and enterprises at all levels will earnestly implement it.
