　　Schools' Production Already Yielding Surplus
    Individual Schools' Poor Management Leads to Stagnation
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The extracurricular production of major universities and middle schools in Beijing has achieved considerable success in just four months. Students' meals have improved, and the amount of vegetables in their diets has significantly increased. Most schools have also generated a surplus from their production funds. According to the income and expenditure of many schools with better production results, the expenses per mu in a season (four months) are: 60 baskets of manure, about 96,000 yuan; technicians, an average of one person for every 15 mu, with a monthly salary of 300 jin of millet, or 80 jin of millet per mu per season, about 96,000 yuan; agricultural tools, including one sickle, hand hoe, iron shovel, and leveling rake, about 36,000 yuan, averaging two years of use, or 6,000 yuan per season; water well, including water wheel, labor and materials costing about 6,000 jin of millet, used by 10 mu for 20 years, or 10 jin per mu per season, about 12,000 yuan; miscellaneous expenses, calculated at 10 jin of millet, about 12,000 yuan; interest, with a loan of 300 jin of millet per mu, at 3% interest, or 36 jin per season, about 43,200 yuan. Income: an average of 6,000 jin of vegetables produced per mu per season, calculated at two-fifths of the market price of 150 yuan per jin, or 60 yuan per jin, totaling 360,000 yuan. After deducting expenses, there is a surplus of 94,800 yuan.
    The above figures use the highest standards for expenses and the lowest standards for income. Some schools do not pay for manure, or their products fetch higher prices, resulting in even greater surpluses. Some individual schools have poor soil, leading to smaller surpluses, but with diligent management, a surplus is assured.
    However, a few schools have not paid enough attention to production due to insufficient administrative leadership, and their management plans are not refined enough. Lacking experience and unwilling to learn humbly, they have negatively impacted production, even leading to stagnation, which urgently needs to be corrected.
    [Another Dispatch] Tsinghua University has now formulated its second-season production plan and has already begun work. Their plan is based on the total need for vegetables by the dining hall in the second season, the types of vegetables needed, and the amount of each type. They then allocate the acreage for planting various vegetables based on the nature of the soil. This planning method is worthy of reference by other schools.

    [Another Dispatch] The first batch of crops at Huiwen Middle School, except for wheat, was completely harvested on the 2nd. The total was 2,227 jin of spinach, 7,460 jin of Chinese cabbage, and 5,228 bundles of red radishes. All were sold to faculty, staff, and students at half the market price. Based on the experience of the first season, the school's production committee purchased red alum and millet to mix and apply to the soil to kill insects before planting the second season's crops. The second season is currently being sown, focusing on potatoes, tomatoes, celery, and eggplant.

### 学校生产已有盈余  个别学校生产经营不善形成停顿

　　学校生产已有盈余
    个别学校生产经营不善形成停顿
    【本报讯】京市各大、中学校的课余生产，在短短四个月内，已有了相当好的成绩。学生伙食得到改善，饭食中的青菜量已较前大为增加。多数学校所投入的生产资金，也已有了盈余。根据许多生产成绩较好的学校的收支情况看来，若以一亩为单位，在一季中（四个月）共支出：粪肥六十筐，约九万六千元；技工，平均十五亩用一人，月薪小米三百斤，每亩每季工薪八十斤小米，约九万六千元；农具，镰刀、手锄、铁锨、平钯各一具，约三万六千元，平均用二年，每季为六千元；水井，包括水车，工料约小米六千斤，按十亩使用二十年，每亩每季十斤，约一万二千元；杂费，按十斤小米计，约一万二千元；利息，每亩贷款小米三百斤，利息三分，每季三十六斤，约四万三千二百元。收入方面：平均每亩每季生产六千斤菜蔬，按市价一百五十元一斤的五分之二，即六十元一斤计算，为三十六万元。收支相抵，尚盈余九万四千八百元。
    以上数字，支出是按最高标准，收入按最低标准。有些学校所用的粪肥不是花钱买的，或产品售价较高，盈余就会更多。个别学校的土壤不好，盈余就要少些，但只要努力经营，盈余是肯定了的。
    但也有少数学校，因行政领导对生产重视不够，对于经营打算的不够精细，没有经验又不肯虚心学习，影响了生产，甚至形成停顿状态，亟待纠正。
    【又讯】清华大学现已订出第二季生产计划，并已开始工作。他们的计划是根据伙食团第二季的总需要量所需要菜的种类及每种菜的需要量，再根据土壤的性质，分配种植各种青菜的亩数。这种计划方法值得各校参考。

    【又讯】汇文中学第一期农作物，除麦子外，已于二日全部收割。计菠菜二千二百二十七斤，小白菜七千四百六十斤，红萝卜五千二百二十八把。全部按市价对折售给教职员工及同学。该校生产委员会根据第一期生产的经验，第二期下种之前买了红矾和小米，混起来下地杀虫。现第二期正在播种，将以土豆、西红柿、芹菜、茄子为主。
