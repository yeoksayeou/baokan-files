　　Zhao Xiya, Deputy Propaganda Officer of the Eighth District Committee of Wu'an County (also a member of the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the district), illegally prevented women from divorcing and arbitrarily tortured women, seriously violating the policies and laws of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party that guarantee human rights and freedom of marriage.

　　Liu Zhuanying, 20 years old, is from Tuling Village in the Eleventh District of Wu'an. She became a child bride at the age of six. Because of abuse by her husband's family, her marriage contract with her husband was terminated with the approval of the district government in 1948. At that time, Zhao Xiya was working in the district, and without Liu Zhuanying's consent, he acted as a matchmaker and introduced her to his cousin, Zhao Tingdi. After the marriage, because Liu Zhuanying discovered that Zhao Tingdi's mother was having an affair with Zhao Migui, they harbored resentment and often made Liu Zhuanying suffer. Influenced by his mother, Zhao Tingdi's relationship with his wife gradually deteriorated. Liu Zhuanying could not bear the abuse from her mother-in-law and husband, and twice last year petitioned the district government for divorce, but was blocked by Zhao Tingdi and his mother. On February 28th of this year, Liu Zhuanying went to the district government again to request a divorce. At this time, Zhao Xiya was at home (Nanzhuang Village, Eleventh District) recuperating. After he found out, he sent someone to pull Liu Zhuanying back from halfway. Zhao Tingdi's mother had asked Zhao Xiya to prevent her divorce, saying to him: "You are a district cadre, are you afraid to fight a woman? Can't you even handle this matter?" That same night, Zhao Xiya, together with his clansmen Zhao Ximei, Zhao Tingyou, and village cadre Zhao Xinian, broke into Liu Zhuanying's house, forcing her to say who was instigating her to divorce, and attempted to prevent Liu Zhuanying from divorcing by threatening her. Liu Zhuanying said: "The government stipulates freedom of marriage, and I have the right to file for divorce. Can you stop me?" At that time, Zhao Xiya forced Liu Zhuanying to put on her clothes and dragged her to the north room for interrogation. He ordered Zhao Xinian and Zhao Ximei to tie Liu Zhuanying to a bench, tying her thighs to the bench, and placing bricks under her legs. He also placed a brick under her tied hands. At the same time, Zhao Tingdi also beat Liu Zhuanying, saying: "I'll teach you to divorce me!" After an hour, Liu Zhuanying fainted from the pain. The next day, Liu Zhuanying could not walk on her legs and crawled to the village chief to complain, but was dragged back by Zhao Tingdi and his mother, and was not allowed to go out. On the morning of the third day, Liu Zhuanying took advantage of the absence of anyone at home, and escaped to her parents' home in Tuling Village with a stick, and reported the incident to the district government with her uncle. Zhao Xiya attempted to cover up his crimes and twice sent letters to the district government distorting the facts. Guo Shixing, the head of the district, mistakenly believed that cadres should be treated leniently when they broke the law, and released Zhao Xiya and other criminals after a perfunctory inquiry. Later, the county party committee discovered the truth and sent Zhao Xiya to the court for detention and prosecution.

　　The Wu'an County People's Court has now sentenced Zhao Xiya to six months of imprisonment; Zhao Migui and four others were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from one month to three months. The county committee has also decided to give Zhao Xiya a disciplinary punishment of probation within the Party.

　　武安县八区区委赵锡亚非法阻挠离婚拷打妇女
    河北省武安县八区区委会副宣传委员赵锡亚（亦系该区中共区委委员），非法阻止妇女离婚，并擅自拷打妇女，严重违犯人民政府与中国共产党保障人权和婚姻自由的政策法令。
    刘专英，年二十岁，是武安十一区土岭村人。她六岁即当了童养媳。因受婆家虐待，于一九四八年经区政府批准和她男人解除婚约。当时赵锡亚在该区工作，未经刘专英本人同意，硬给她做媒，介绍她与自己堂弟赵廷弟结婚。婚后因为赵廷弟母亲与赵米贵通奸被刘专英发觉，因而他们怀恨在心，经常给刘专英气受。赵廷弟因受母亲挑拨，夫妇关系也日渐恶化。刘专英因无法忍受婆婆与丈夫的虐待，在去年曾两次到区政府呈请离婚，但均被赵廷弟与他母亲拦阻。今年二月二十八日，刘专英又去区政府请求离婚。这时赵锡亚正在家（十一区南庄村）养病。他知道后，即派人从半路将刘专英拉回。赵廷弟母亲曾托赵锡亚阻止她离婚，对他说：“你是个区干部，就不敢给个娘们斗？连这事也办不了？”当日半夜，赵锡亚便协同同族赵西梅、赵廷有，村干赵西年闯进刘专英屋内，逼问刘专英要离婚是谁挑拨的，并企图以威胁方式阻止刘专英离婚。刘专英说：“政府规定婚姻自主，我有权利提出离婚，你挡的住吗？”当时赵锡亚即强迫刘专英穿上衣裳，拉到北屋去审问。他令赵西年、赵西梅，将刘专英捆在板凳上，把大腿与板凳捆在一起，向腿下垫砖。并在背手底下还垫砖一块。同时，赵廷弟还打着刘专英说：“我叫你给我离婚！”经过一个钟头后，刘专英疼得昏过去了。第二天刘专英两腿已不能走路，便爬着去找村长诉苦；但又被赵廷弟及其婆婆拉回，并不让出门。第三天上午，刘专英趁家里无人，拄着棍子逃到土岭村娘家，同伯父一起向区政府告发。赵锡亚企图掩饰自己的罪恶，曾两次向区政府去信歪曲事实。该区区长郭士兴错误地认为干部犯法应从轻处理，只草率的问了一下，即将赵锡亚等凶犯放走。后经县委发觉，才将赵锡亚送交法院扣押法办。
    武安县人民法院现已判处赵锡亚半年有期徒刑；赵米贵等五人则分别判处一个月至三个月徒刑。该县县委会亦已决定给赵锡亚以留党察看处分。
