Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Significant progress has been made in the inventory of warehouses in North China provinces. The inventory work began in April and is expected to be completed by the end of this month.

During this inventory process, various regions have discovered a large amount of unaccounted-for materials. For instance, the Zhangjiakou Railway Machinery Factory in Chahar has over 4 billion yuan worth of such materials. This includes nearly 5,000 types of equipment, weighing approximately 4,000 tons, that have been stockpiled for over 40 years. The Chahar Central Electric Power Bureau cleared over 200,000 pieces of unaccounted-for equipment. The Datong branch of the Grain Company cleared over 370,000 catties of various unaccounted-for grains. Twenty-six state-owned factories and mines in Hebei Province have preliminarily identified unaccounted-for materials equivalent to 1.03 million catties of millet. Among them, the Linqing Factory has stockpiled pig iron sufficient for six years of production. The Shanxi Province Match Factory cleared 320,000 catties of rosin stockpiled by the Japanese invaders. The Taiyuan Railway Bureau cleared over 3,600 types of finished products, spare parts, and semi-finished products, valued at 3.4 billion yuan, in two months. The Ordnance Repair Shop of the Suiyuan Military Region found a pair of scissors binoculars worth 70 million yuan in a pile of scrap iron, as well as nearly 500 types of important tools and gun parts. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Pingyuan Province cleared unaccounted-for property equivalent to 378,000 catties of rice.

In addition to urban enterprises and departments, some rural areas in Hebei Province have also conducted inventory work. The Tianjin Special District has cleared over 190,000 catties of grain, 14 horsepower machines, 17 livestock, as well as clothing, timber, salt, and other items. Ji County in the Tongxian Special District has cleared 140,000 catties of grain, 27,000 catties of gasoline, over 5,000 catties of lubricating oil, as well as cotton military uniforms, sacks, and other items. The Baoding Special District has cleared 119 types of materials, valued at approximately 130,000 catties of millet. The sources of these materials include supplies and spoils of war left in the villages by the troops during the Beijing-Tianjin Campaign. Because the main forces moved south and were unable to handle them promptly, and village cadres feared the troops would return with receipts to claim them, they did not report them. Another part consists of materials from various organs, troops, and factories during the guerrilla war, which were dispersed and stored continuously, and were not promptly cleared and handed over after the cadres in charge were transferred, and have been scattered in various places. Through in-depth investigation and explanation, as well as exposing and punishing the concealment and corruption of a few district and village cadres and bad elements, these materials have been cleared out.

During this inventory, many serious shortcomings were found in past material management, in addition to the large number of useful items being shelved, there were also: (1) Some warehouses had records but no actual stock. For example, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau warehouse had 660 million yuan worth of materials on the books, but they had actually been lost or corroded during the enemy-puppet era, while the records still showed them as present. The state-owned factories and mines in Hebei Province also falsely recorded materials equivalent to over 550,000 catties of millet. Once the higher authorities called for them, they could not be produced. (2) Some warehouses were stockpiling materials that could not be used for a long time and were not properly handled. (3) Some warehouse managers only cared about the quantity of materials and not the quality. For example, the Guisui Electric Flour Mill stored 8,000 pounds of sulfuric acid, which was found to have completely deteriorated during this inventory, resulting in a loss of over 25 million yuan. In response to the above phenomena, various regions have paid attention to correcting them after this inventory.

　　华北查出大量账外物资
    部分仓库有账无物或存积变质物品
    【新华社十日讯】华北各省清理仓库工作已有很大成绩。清理工作于四月开始，本月底可结束。
    此次各地在清库工作中发现账外物资甚多。察哈尔张垣铁路机厂即有总值达四十余亿元的账外物资。其中有积存了四十多年重约四千吨的近五千种器材。察中电业局清理出账外器材达二十余万件。粮食公司大同支公司清出各种账外粮食三十七万余斤。河北全省二十六个省营厂矿，已初步查出账外物资合小米一百零三万斤。其中临清工厂积存生铁，足供该厂六年生产之用。山西省火柴厂清理出日寇积存的松香达三十二万斤。太原铁路局两个月中共清出三千六百多种成品、备料与半成品，价值三十四亿元。绥远军区修械所在废铁堆中，清出一架价值七千万元的剪形望远镜，另有重要工具、枪炮零件近五百种。平原省焦作煤矿清出账外财产折米三十七万八千斤。
    除各城市的企业部门等外，河北省部分农村也进行了清库工作。天津专区已清出粮食十九万多斤、马力机十四架、牲口十七头，以及衣服、木料、食盐等物。通县专区的蓟县，清出粮食十四万斤、汽油两万七千斤、滑机油五千多斤，另有棉军装、麻袋等物。保定专区已清出物资一百十九种，约值小米十三万多斤。以上物资的来源，一部分是在京津战役时，部队存在村中的供应品和战利品，因大军南下未及时处理，村中干部又怕部队凭条来取，没有报告。一部分是在游击战争时期各机关、部队、工厂的物资，因不断分散存放，而经手干部调动后，未能及时清理和交代，一直被散弃各地。这次经过深入调查、解释，并揭发和处罚了少数区村干部及坏分子隐瞒贪污的行为，这些物资都被清理了出来。
    此次清库中，发现过去在物资管理上存在许多严重缺点，除大量的有用物品被搁置外，尚有：（一）部分仓库有账无物。如太原铁路局仓库账目上有六亿六千万元的材料，实际上已在敌伪时代遗失或腐蚀了，而账目上仍然写着。河北全省各省营厂矿亦虚存物资合小米五十五万多斤。一旦上级调用时，即无法拿出。（二）有些仓库存积着长期不能使用的材料，未作适当处理。（三）部分管理仓库人员，只管物资数量，不管质量。如归绥电面厂存放八千磅硫酸，这次清库时，发现全部变质，损失达二千五百余万元。对上述现象，各地在此次清理后，多已注意纠正。
