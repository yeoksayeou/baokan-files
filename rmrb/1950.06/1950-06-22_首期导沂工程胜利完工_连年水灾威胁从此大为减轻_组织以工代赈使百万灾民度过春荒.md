Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th. The great first phase of the Yi (River) Diversion Project in northern Jiangsu has been successfully completed on June 10th, according to the planned schedule. This project, after two construction periods lasting more than three months from last winter to this spring, involved approximately 570,000 civilian workers from ten counties in the Huaiyin Special Region, over 5,000 government working staff, and over 300 engineering technicians. To transport grain and grass to the construction areas, mobilization extended to provinces such as Anhui and Zhejiang.

The main aim of the Yi River Diversion Project is to open a wide new lower course of the Yi River in the area under the jurisdiction of the Huaiyin Special Region in northern Jiangsu, so that the excessive floodwaters of the Yi River during summer and autumn can directly flow into the sea. The northern Jiangsu plain is where all the rivers from southern Shandong, northern Anhui, and southeastern Henan converge into the sea, and it is a well-known water network area. Since the Yellow River diverted into the Huai River, the rivers in northern Jiangsu, especially the lower reaches of the Huai River, have been silted up, the river systems have been disordered, and they have been encroaching on each other. The Yi, Shu, and Si rivers all originate from the Yi Meng Mountains, with high sources and rapid flows, coming with fierce momentum. According to measurements, the maximum flow of the Yi, Shu, and Si rivers, plus the amount of torrential rain in the Huai River northern basins, totals about 11,000 cubic meters per second, and in normal years it is also 6,700 cubic meters per second, but the total drainage capacity of the Yi, Shu, and Si rivers at their tail ends is only 1,500 cubic meters per second. Therefore, the flooding of the above rivers is inevitable. Moreover, because the lower reaches of the Yi River are scattered into the Grand Canal, the Guan River, and the Qiangwei River, one river's rise causes the flooding of all rivers, and floods occur year after year. Last year's flood was the worst in forty years. Therefore, the people of northern Jiangsu urgently demand the harnessing of the Yi, Shu, and other rivers. To meet the needs of the broad masses of the people, the People's Government, despite being in financial difficulties, still took out the forces it could use to carry out water control projects.

The surveying and mapping of the Yi River Diversion Project began between August and September last year. In late November, the East China Military and Political Committee's Water Conservancy Department, the Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office, and the Northern Jiangsu District Committee of the Communist Party of China jointly decided to establish the Yi River Diversion Project Headquarters and Political Department in northern Jiangsu to directly lead the project. The newly opened lower course of the Yi River is 190 kilometers long. That is, diverting water from Zhouzui in Xin'an County (a newly established county, formerly Xin'an Town on the Longhai Railway), cutting off Zhangshan, diverting the water eastward, following the Shuh River channel north of Shuyang City, and then passing eastward through the Guantian River, the Yan River, the Xiaochao River and other rivers, and entering the sea at the Guan River estuary. This new lower course of the Yi River is aimed at smoothly discharging approximately 4,000 cubic meters of floodwater per second. To excavate such a 190-kilometer-long new river channel is beyond today's financial and material resources, and cannot be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, the Yi River Diversion Project adopted a plan of building dikes to confine water and floodplains to discharge floods; that is, building two long dikes along the above route, and the area between the two dikes would be used as the river channel for flood discharge. The entire project is scheduled to be completed in four phases.

The first phase of the Yi River Diversion Project completed this year was arduous. The entire project includes: 1. Building two new dikes, 5.1 meters to 11 meters high, extending directly from Zhangshan to the Guan River estuary. The two dikes are a total of 380 kilometers long. 2. Cutting off Zhangshan to divert water eastward. The cutting of the ridge project must be completed in phases in the first, second, and third phases, and the first phase is to cut a river channel 200 meters to 300 meters wide and 2.1 meters deep. 3. Building the Luoma Lake dike and the Zaohe (i.e., the Grand Canal) water confinement dam. 4. Blocking all the branch rivers separated from the Yuan Shu and Yi rivers, such as the Liu Lao Jian, Nan Liu Tang River, and Sha Jiang River. The above projects totaled 38 million cubic meters of earthwork. After two construction periods from last winter to this spring by 570,000 civilian workers, the main projects were completed on May 20th. The water confinement dam of the Zao River and the water blocking dams of the Liu Lao Jian, Sha Jiang River and other rivers were also completed on June 10th. The People's Government is now inspecting the project, organizing flood control, and organizing the relocation of more than 10,000 households living in the new Yi River bed to resettle. Once the riverbed residents are relocated, the water can be released. Although the completion of the first phase of the project cannot completely eliminate the floods in northern Jiangsu, it can greatly reduce the threat of floods faced by the people of northern Jiangsu.

During the construction of the first phase of the project, thanks to strong leadership, the civilian workers fully recognized that the project was crucial to their own interests. More than 15,000 Communist Party members and more than 4,000 Communist Youth League members were able to take the lead and set an example. The morale of the civilian workers was generally very high, creating a record of digging 2.8 cubic meters of earth per person per day. The Yi River model Wang Daqiao team dug 1,291 cubic meters of earth in 14 days, completing the tasks of both the last winter and this spring periods that the team shouldered. Li Lanzhen, the female stretcher hero who was famous in the Huaihai area during the Liberation War, also brought a women's team to participate in the work. More than 1,000 women in Xin'an County fought on the new Yi River line just like the men. In particular, the 39,000 civilian workers from Xin'an and Suining counties made the greatest contribution, completing the most difficult eight-mile-long section of the Zhangshan ridge cutting project in 30 days with iron picks and shovels. Most of the project was carried out in rain and snow and in mud that reached the shins, but the cadres and civilian workers finally overcame these difficulties.

While leading the Yi River Diversion Project, the Northern Jiangsu People's Government also organized work-for-relief to carry out disaster relief work. The first phase of the Yi River Diversion Project cost 186 million catties of rice, most of which was received by disaster victims. The civilian workers who participated in the Yi River Diversion Project were all disaster victims, and more than one million of them and their families relied on this to survive the spring famine.

　　首期导沂工程胜利完工
    连年水灾威胁从此大为减轻
    组织以工代赈使百万灾民度过春荒
    【新华社上海十六日电】伟大的苏北第一期导沂（河）工程，已按预定计划于六月十日胜利完工。该项工程经过去冬、今春前后三个多月两次施工，参加这个工程的，计有淮阴专区十个县的民工约五十七万，人民政府工作干部五千余，和工程技术人员三百余人。为向施工地区运粮运草，动员范围远及安徽、浙江等省。
    导治沂河工程主要是在苏北淮阴专区所属地区开辟一条宽阔的新的沂河下游，使沂河在夏秋间过多的洪水得以直接入海。苏北平原是鲁南、皖北、豫东南所有河流汇流入海的地方，是著名的水网区域。自黄河夺淮以后，苏北各河特别是淮河下游淤塞，各河水系紊乱，互相侵扰，沂、沭、泗诸水又都发源沂蒙山区，源高流急，来势汹涌。据测量：沂、沭、泗诸水最大流量加上淮北各流域的暴雨量，共计约达一万一千秒公方，平常年份亦达六千七百秒公方，但沂、沭、泗诸水尾闾排水量合计仅为一千五百秒公方，因此上述各河泛滥成灾便成为势所必然。又因沂河下游散入运河、灌河、蔷薇河，致一河涨水，各河泛滥，水灾连年不断。去年水灾之重更为四十年来所未有。因此，苏北人民迫切要求整治沂、沭等河流。人民政府为适应广大人民的要求，虽处在财政困难中，仍拿出了所能使用的力量来兴办治河工程。
    导沂工程的勘测系于去年八九月间开始。十一月下旬，华东军政委员会水利部、苏北人民行政公署及中共苏北区党委共同商定，在苏北成立了导沂工程司令部和政治部，直接领导工程进行。新辟的沂河下游计长一百九十公里。即在新安县（新设县，原陇海线上的新安镇）属的周嘴开河引水，切断嶂山，引水东流，沿沭河河道经沭阳城北，向东穿官田河、盐河、小潮河等河，至灌河口入海。这一条新的沂河下游河道，是以能顺畅宣泄四千左右秒公方的洪水为目标。要挖掘这样一条一百九十公里的新河道，不是今天财力物力所能举办，亦非短期所能完成的。因此，导沂工程采用了筑堤束水漫滩排洪的方案；即沿上述路线筑两条长堤，两堤之间即作为河道，用以排洪。全部工程预定分四期完成。
    今年所完成的导沂第一期工程是艰巨的。全部工程包括：一、新筑高达五点一公尺到十一公尺的两条河堤，由嶂山直伸到灌河口。两堤共长三百八十公里。二、切断嶂山引水东流。切岭工程须在一、二、三期中分期完成，第一期为切开一道宽二百公尺到三百公尺、深二点一公尺的河槽。三、筑骆马湖堤及皂河（即运河）束水坝。四、堵闭源沭、沂两河所分出的所有支河，如刘老涧、南六塘河、沙礓河等。以上工程共计土方三千八百万公方，经去冬今春前后五十七万民工的两次施工，五月二十日，各主要工程即已完工，皂河束水坝和刘老涧、沙礓河等河的堵水坝，亦于六月十日全部完成。现人民政府正检验工程、组织防汛，并正组织新沂河河床内的万余户居民移出安家。河床居民移完，即可放水。第一期工程完成后虽尚不能完全消除苏北水患，但已可使苏北人民所受水灾的威胁大大减轻。
    第一期工程施工期间，由于领导强，民工们充分认识到工程与自己切身利益攸关，一万五千多共产党员和四千多青年团员能积极带头起模范作用，民工们的工作情绪一般很高，创造了每人每天挖土二点八公方的纪录。导沂模范王大锹班，曾在十四天内挖土一千二百九十一公方，完成了该班应担负的去冬今春两期的任务。曾在解放战争中名满淮海地区的女担架英雄李兰贞，这次也带了妇女班参加作工。新安县一千多名妇女和男人一样地在新沂河线上战斗。特别是新安、睢宁两县三万九千民工的功绩最大，他们用铁镐、铁铲在三十天内，完成了最艰难的八里长的一段嶂山切岭工程。工程的大部是在雨雪交加和泥泞没胫的情况下进行的，但干部和民工们终于战胜了这些困难。
    苏北人民政府在领导导沂中，并组织以工代赈，进行了救灾工作。导沂第一期工程费为大米一亿八千六百万斤，绝大部分为灾民所得。参加导沂的民工均为灾民，他们及其家属共百余万人即赖此度过了春荒。
