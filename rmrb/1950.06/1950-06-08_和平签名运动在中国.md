　　The Peace Signature Campaign in China
    Zuan Zu
    The signature campaign to defend world peace is vigorously unfolding throughout China.
    Since the Chinese Committee for the Defence of World Peace issued a circular on April 28, calling on compatriots across the country to sign the declaration of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee prohibiting atomic weapons, it has received enthusiastic responses from people's organizations and people from all walks of life across the country, and the signature campaign has rapidly become a mass movement on a national scale.
    Mass rallies to defend world peace have been held one after another in many large cities across the country, and even in remote border areas. Up to the present, according to extremely incomplete statistics, the number of people participating in the signature campaign nationwide has approached five million.
    The scope of participation in the signature campaign is extremely broad, and the genuine feelings of the Chinese people are fully revealed at the same time.
    On the afternoon of May 14, more than 6,000 representatives from all walks of life in the capital held a signature campaign rally in Zhongshan Park, issuing the slogan "A signature is a warning to the warmongers."
    On May 18, more than 50,000 young people in the capital held a signature mobilization rally at the Temple of Agriculture. They shouted, "Ban atomic weapons!" "Long live world peace!"
    The Yichang troops of the Third Field Army, who had fought in the Huaihai area, resolutely stated in the signature campaign that they would respond to the provocations of the warmongers by liberating Taiwan. Zhang Yi, a veteran of honor from Shenyang, joined the liberation struggle at the age of thirteen. In the thirteen years of fighting against the enemy, he was wounded seven times. Now there is still an American-made bullet in his right lung that has not been removed. As soon as he heard about signing against the war of aggression, he said, "We have every right to do so." In the signature campaign in the various units of the North China Military Region, many soldiers who were not very literate, in order to express their determination to defend peace, did not ask others to write for them, but solemnly wrote their names stroke by stroke. A certain soldier of a certain artillery said: "Tell the American imperialists, we have captured American-made artillery, and if you dare to launch a war, we will wipe you out!"
    Workers in various places have expressed their intention to respond to the peace signature campaign by stepping up production and displaying a high degree of labor enthusiasm. Tian Guiying, a female driver from Lushun, said, "Only by striving for peace can we guarantee our work and life." Conductors on various lines of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau mobilized more than 5,000 passengers to sign on the train. Workers who are stepping up the repair of the Pukou wharf said that only by opposing the war of aggression can their labor achievements not be destroyed.
    More than 3,000 people participated in the "Peasant Defence of World Peace Conference" held in Baliqiao, a suburb of Beijing. Some farmers also solemnly put their fingerprints under their signatures according to their own habits.
    The elderly, the old society gave them unspeakable suffering, and finally saw the coming of a bright new society in the last stage of their lives. So their feelings are particularly deep. Mr. Qiao Xiangwei, a 63-year-old man in Beijing, used his signature to condemn the bombing atrocities of the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes. After signing, an old lady Ma in Xi'an said: "Who wants the damn reactionaries to slaughter the people again."
    Yin Shu, a housewife in Shanghai, was blindly followed her husband to Taiwan before liberation due to the influence of the reactionaries' rumors. She personally experienced all kinds of inhuman life under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Finally, she decided to leave her husband and return to Shanghai after many twists and turns. Seeing the vigorous new atmosphere in China, she excitedly wrote her name on the signature book.
    Many rickshaw pullers in Nanjing went to the Xinhua Daily to sign, recalling being beaten by American soldiers during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek bandits and saying: "We can no longer let the imperialists bully us."
    The students of the Beijing Qiming Blind School pierced the declaration of defending world peace and their own names on hard paper. Although their eyes are blind, their hearts are bright.
    The youths of various ethnic groups, including Hui, Han, Uygur, Mongolian, and Tibetan in Northwest China, united as one and launched a widespread and in-depth signature campaign.
    These calls from the vast number of Chinese people demonstrate how determined the Chinese people are to defend world peace and how strong their confidence is in winning peace.

　　和平签名运动在中国
    纉祖
    保卫世界和平的签名运动，已在全中国各地蓬勃展开。
    自中国保卫世界和平大会委员会于四月二十八日发出通告，号召全国同胞在世界和大常委会禁止原子武器的宣言上签名以后，已获得全国性的各人民团体和各界人民的热烈响应，签名运动迅速变成了一个全国规模的群众性运动。
    保卫世界和平的群众大会，在全国许多大城市，以至偏僻的边疆地方，都先后召开了。到最近为止，根据极不完全的统计，全国参加签名的人数，已接近五百万。
    参加签名的范围极其广泛，在签名运动中同时充分地流露了中国人民的真正情感。
    五月十四日下午，首都各界代表六千余人在中山公园举行了签名运动大会，发出“一个签名就是一个对战争贩子的警告”的口号。
    五月十八日，首都五万多青年在先农坛举行签名动员大会。高呼“禁用原子武器！”“世界和平万岁！”
    曾经转战淮海等地的三野宜昌部队，在签名运动中，坚决表示以解放台湾来回答战争贩子的挑衅。沈阳荣誉军人张义，自十三岁即参加解放斗争，在整整十三年的对敌作战中，他曾负伤七次。现在右肺还有一颗美制枪弹没有取出。他一听到签名反对侵略战争的事，就说：“我们有充分的权利这样做。”在华北军区各部队签名运动中，许多识字不多的战士，为了表示自己保卫和平的决心，不叫别人代笔，一笔一划地郑重地写上自己的姓名。炮兵某炮某战士说：“告诉美帝，我们缴获了美制大炮，如果你们敢发动战争，我们就要把你们消灭！”
    各地工人都表示要以加紧生产发挥高度劳动热忱来响应和平签名运动。旅大女司机田桂英说：“唯有争取和平才能保证我们的工作和生活。”齐齐哈尔铁路局各线乘务员在列车中动员了五千多旅客签名。加紧抢修浦口码头的工人表示只有反对侵略战争，他们的劳动成果才不会遭到破坏。
    北京郊区八里庄举行的“农民保卫世界和平大会”有三千多人参加，有的农民还照自己的习惯在签名下郑重地捺上指模。
    老年人，旧社会曾给他们以说不尽的苦痛，在一生的后一段终于看到了光明的新社会的到来。所以他们感受也就特别深刻。北京六十三岁的乔象维老先生以签名来谴责美蒋匪机的轰炸暴行。西安马老太太在签名之后说：“谁还愿意该死的反动派再来屠杀人民。”
    上海的家庭妇女殷淑，解放前受反动派造谣的影响，盲目跟着丈夫逃到台湾，在那里亲身受到蒋匪帮统治下种种非人的生活，终于决心离开丈夫辗转回到上海，看到中国蓬勃的新生气象，极度兴奋地在签名书上写上名字。
    南京许多三轮车夫到新华日报社签名，回忆着蒋匪统治时期遭受美国兵的殴打说：“我们不能再让帝国主义来欺侮我们。”
    北京启明瞽目院的学生们，在硬纸上刺出保卫世界和平的宣言和他们自己的名字。虽然他们的眼睛失明了，但他们的心是明亮的。
    西北回、汉、维、蒙、藏等各族青年团结一致，广泛而深入地展开了签名运动。
    中国广大人民的这些呼声，表现了中国人民保卫世界和平的意愿，是何等坚决，表现了中国人民赢取和平的胜利信心，又是何等强烈。
