Clinic Disregards Workers' Lives

To the Editorial Department:

We are workers from the Tangshan Qixin Cement Plant's Repair Shop. The clinic in our factory is irresponsible towards sick workers and demonstrates a serious bureaucratic style of work. We are writing down the following facts that we know:

On February 8th, worker Wang Shaoxian from the Repair Shop went to the clinic for treatment because of leg pain. Doctor Chen Chongshou used a small wooden hammer to hammer Wang Shaoxian's leg for a long time, but it didn't work. Doctor Chen said to him, "The leg and teeth are related. Your leg pain is because wind entered your teeth. Now only your left leg hurts, but I'm afraid your right leg will also hurt in the future. You must have your teeth pulled out to cure your leg." Wang Shaoxian didn't understand medicine and believed him, so he had a tooth pulled out. But not only was his leg not cured, but it hurt even more. He was in so much pain that he couldn't go to work and stayed at home for four or five days. In the end, he had to ask an outside doctor to cure his leg.

On February 24th, worker Liu Zesui from the second shift went to the clinic to have a tooth pulled because of toothache. Surgeon Zhang Kuangwen performed the operation. Because Doctor Zhang didn't know how to pull teeth, he hadn't pulled it out after an hour. Doctor Zhang told the worker, "Wait for Doctor Ma to come on Saturday to pull it out for you." So, Liu Zesui was sent away. Not only was Liu Zesui's tooth not cured, but it hurt even more. He fainted while working in the factory. Everyone sent him to the clinic again. After Doctor Zhang Kuangwen gave him two injections, Liu woke up. As a result, Liu Zesui was in pain at home for four or five days. He waited until Saturday to have Doctor Ma cure him.

On the morning of March 20th, worker Zhang Zhijun from the Repair Shop suddenly fainted while working. After being revived, he felt a very bad headache and went to the clinic for treatment. Doctor Chen Chongshou diagnosed the condition, wrote a prescription, and Doctor Dong Wenlu from the pharmacy gave him a small bottle of liquid medicine. Zhang Zhijun went back to work at the factory. Later, the clinic suddenly realized that the wrong medicine had been given, but they didn't call the Repair Shop until 5:00 p.m. They didn't say that the wrong medicine had been given, they just asked Zhang Zhijun to pick up the medicine. Zhang Zhijun was not in the Repair Shop at the time, and the clinic didn't bother to look for him, so they just let it go. That night, after Zhang Zhijun took the medicine, he had diarrhea all night. The next day, he went to the clinic to ask. Doctor Chen Chongshou not only didn't say that the clinic had given the wrong medicine, but said, "It's good to have diarrhea." And he laughed loudly. Later, it was learned that he had taken "tetanus antitoxin." Zhang Zhijun had diarrhea for more than a month.

On April 23rd, worker Ju Yuanyou from the third shift slag kiln went to the clinic for emergency treatment because of severe abdominal pain. But the doctors didn't pay attention, and just casually gave him two injections, which didn't work. He was in so much pain that he lay down on a chair in the clinic. By 6:00 p.m., all the doctors had left work, ignoring this groaning worker. Ju Yuanyou began to shout. Doctor Zhang Kuangwen wrote a letter of introduction to the Municipal Hospital, asking Ju Yuanyou to go there. Ju Yuanyou was in severe pain, and after walking twenty steps, he fell to the ground. Fortunately, workers Zhao Changrong and Zhang Fengshan passed by and helped him up and hired a rickshaw to send him. Another worker, Zhai Ruizhi, went to Doctor Zhang and said, "The Municipal Hospital is farther than Kailuan Hospital. Why not write a letter of introduction to Kailuan?" The doctors were frying crabs at this time, so they wrote a letter of introduction to Kailuan Hospital, vaguely saying that it was probably appendicitis.

There are many more things like this; the above is just what we know. We hope you will publish this letter and give the clinic a serious criticism.

Tangshan Qixin Cement Plant Repair Shop Workers Liu Sizhong, Zhang Zeng?

Editor's Note: The completely irresponsible work attitude of the doctors at the Tangshan Qixin Cement Plant Repair Shop clinic is a criminal act of disregarding workers' lives and must be corrected. The person in charge of the factory must pay serious attention to this phenomenon and thoroughly rectify the factory's clinic.

### 卫生所玩忽工人生命  唐山启新洋灰厂工人来信申诉

　　卫生所玩忽工人生命
    唐山启新洋灰厂工人来信申诉编辑同志：
    我们是唐山启新洋灰厂束修机厂的工人。现在我们工厂里的卫生所，对有病的工人们不负责任，有着严重的官僚主义作风。现在将我们所知道的几点事实写在下面：
    二月八日，修机厂的王绍先工友，因为腿疼，便到卫生所去治。陈崇寿大夫用小木锤把王绍先的腿锤了半天，并没生效。陈大夫对他说：“腿和牙有连带关系。你腿疼是因为牙里进了风。现在光是左腿疼，恐怕将来右腿也会疼。必须把牙拔掉，才能把腿治好。”王绍先不懂医学，信了他的话便把牙拔掉一个。可是他的腿不但没有治好，反而疼的更厉害了。他疼得没有办法上班，在家养了四五天。最后还是请了外边的医生来，才把腿治好。
    二月二十四日，二牌工友刘泽绥因为牙疼，到卫生所去拔牙。由外科大夫张匡文施行手术。因为张大夫不会拔牙所以拔了一小时还没有拔掉。张大夫便告诉工友说：“星期六等马大夫来给你拔吧。”这样便把刘泽绥打发走了。刘泽绥的牙不但没治好，反而痛得更厉害了。在厂里工作的时候他痛得晕过去。大家又把他送到卫生所去。经张匡文大夫打了两针，刘才清醒过来。结果，刘泽绥在家疼了四五天。等到星期六，才叫马大夫治好。
    三月二十日上午，修机厂工友张志俊，工作时忽然晕倒了。经人救醒后，他感到头非常疼，便到卫生所去治。陈崇寿大夫诊断了病状，开了药方，由药房董文禄大夫发给一小瓶药水。张志俊就回厂工作。后来卫生所忽然发觉把药水给错了，但他们到下午五点钟，才给修机厂打电话。他们并不说药水给错了，只叫张志俊去拿药。当时张志俊不在修机厂，卫生所也没赶紧去找，就马虎过去了。当天晚上，张志俊把药吃了以后，就泻了一夜肚子。第二天，他到卫生所去问。陈崇寿大夫不但不说卫生所给错了药，反而说：“泻了肚就好了。”并且还哈哈大笑。后来才知道他吃的是“破伤风抗毒素”。张志俊一直泻了一个多月肚子。
    四月二十三号，三牌渣子窑工友壉元有，因为肚子疼得厉害，便到卫生所挂了急诊号。可是大夫们都不加注意，随便给打了两针，没生效。他肚子疼得难受，就躺在卫生所的一张椅子上。到下午六点钟，大夫都下班了，也不管这位呻吟着的工友。壉元有就开口喊了起来。张匡文大夫就写了一封给市立医院的介绍信，叫壉元有到那里去。壉元有肚子正疼得厉害，走了二十几步，就跌倒在地上。当时幸有赵常荣、张凤山二位工友经过，才把他扶起来，并雇洋车送他。另一位工友翟瑞芝，去找张大夫说：“市立医院比开滦医院远。为啥不开介绍信到开滦去呢。”大夫们这时正在炸螃蟹，便开了一个给开滦医院的介绍信，并含糊地说，大概是盲肠炎。
    像这样的事情，还有很多；上面只是我们所知道的。希望你们刊登这封信，并给该卫生所以严重的批评。
        唐山市启新洋灰厂束修机厂工人  刘思仲  张增?
    编者按：唐山启新洋灰厂束修机厂卫生所医生这种完全不负责任的工作态度，是玩忽工人生命的犯罪行为，必须加以纠正。该厂负责人必须严重注意这种现象，彻底整顿该厂医务所。
