　　Party Journal Worker Diligent and Responsible, Comrade Wang Tan Commended

　　Comrade Wang Tan of the General Office of the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is engaged in Party journal editing. Because he actively responded to the Party's call for professionalization of cadre work, he has made great progress in practical work. He strengthened the planning of his work, overcame the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic, and accurately calculated the time for copying, issuing, proofreading, and publishing, arranging it into a schedule. At the same time, he signed a contract with the printing factory to ensure timely publication. Because Comrade Wang Tan truly recognized the importance of specialization, he was determined to study and improve his work. He eliminated the past phenomena of typos and incorrect sentences. He is able to summarize his work monthly and frequently studies ways to improve work methods. Under the guidance of his superiors, he systematically selected and organized the central theme of each issue, strengthening the guiding nature of the Party journal. At the same time, in order to closely connect with reality and the masses, he added a "Comments and Replies" column and established contact with correspondents, increasing the number of submissions. In short, after recognizing the importance of specialization, Comrade Wang Tan strengthened the planning and sense of responsibility in his work, overcame the blind and disorganized style of work, and greatly improved work efficiency.

　　At the beginning, Comrade Wang Tan also mistakenly believed: "If the work is too specialized, my work scope will be narrowed. Without understanding the overall situation, the work will be difficult to do." But later he thought: revolutionary work is diverse, how much can one person do after all? To improve the work, one must be familiar with the business and delve into the business. Based on this thinking, coupled with the leadership of the Party and the help of comrades, he improved work efficiency and was commended by the directly subordinate Party Committee of the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

　　党刊工作者认真负责  王潭同志受表扬
    中共辽西省委办公室王潭同志，是从事党刊编辑工作的。由于他积极响应党关于干部工作专业化的号召，在实际工作中获得了很大的进步。他加强了工作的计划性，克服了忙乱现象，把抄稿、发稿、校对、出刊的时间精确地计算出来，排成日程。同时又和印刷厂订立合同，保证按时出刊。由于王潭同志真正认识了专业化的重要，他决心钻研改进工作。他消灭了过去错字错句的现象。他能够按月总结工作，经常研究改进工作方法。在上级指导下，有计划有系统地选择和组织每期稿件中心，加强了党刊的指导性。同时为了密切联系实际、联系群众，又增设了批答栏，并和通讯员建立了联系，使来稿增多。总之，王潭同志在认识到专业化的重要后，加强了工作的计划性和自己的责任心，克服了盲目乱抓的事务主义作风，使工作效率大大地提高。
    王潭同志在开始时也曾错误地认为：“工作专一了，自己的工作范围缩小了。不了解全面情况，工作难做。”但他后来想到：革命工作是多样的，一个人究竟能作多少？要把工作提高，只有熟悉业务、钻研业务。在这种思想基础上，加上党的领导和同志们的帮助，他把工作效率提高了，而且获得中共辽西省委直属党委的表扬。
