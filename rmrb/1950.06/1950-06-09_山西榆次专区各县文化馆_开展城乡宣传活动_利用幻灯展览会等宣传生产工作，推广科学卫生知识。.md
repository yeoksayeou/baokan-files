(Reported by this newspaper) In the past year, the People's Cultural Centers in various counties of Yuci Prefecture, Shanxi Province, have initially carried out urban and rural cultural propaganda activities in coordination with production and current central tasks. The main forms of activities include projecting slides, holding picture and model exhibitions, publishing mass blackboards, establishing reading rooms for books and newspapers, and providing cultural and remedial education for workers.

In terms of slide shows, various counties have produced a total of 2,765 slides, screened them 209 times, and reached more than 130,000 viewers in the past year. They have toured various towns and villages. The content of the slides includes production, maternal and child health, current affairs policies, etc., which are closely related to the central tasks of each period, especially production; at the same time, they can also make appropriate publicity by utilizing temple fairs or other mass gatherings. The slides have a very deep impression on the masses, who call the slides "local movies," and are warmly welcomed by the masses wherever they go.

In the past year, the counties have held a total of 55 exhibitions, including charts, cartoons, and physical models. The content is divided into industrial and agricultural production, current affairs, hygiene, cultural learning, and other aspects, with more than 190,000 viewers. In the exhibitions in various places, cadres of local farms, primary school teachers and students, and medical personnel are generally mobilized to help explain, and some also have example performances, which are of great educational significance to the masses. For example, the Xiyang Cultural Center publicized the work of soaking seeds in warm water at the temple fair in Mengbi Village, the second district, and compared the differences between soaking and not soaking seeds in warm water, eliminating the idea that some people did not believe that there were germs on the seeds and were afraid that the warm water would burn the seeds, and promoted the soaking work. The Heshun Cultural Center exhibited and publicized the government's production policy and incentive policy for production at the temple fair in Qiaozhuang Village, the third district, eliminating some farmers' concerns and encouraging the enthusiasm for developing production. In particular, the exhibitions on maternal and child hygiene and prevention of infectious diseases in various counties are most popular among the masses. Many people reflected: If I had known this earlier, how many fewer people would have died!

Mass blackboards have been published 1,375 times in the past year, including daily, every other day, three-day, five-day, and other types. Because the words are popular and the forms are lively, with illustrations, songs, fast-clapper talks, ditties, etc., the masses easily accept them.

　　山西榆次专区各县文化馆
    开展城乡宣传活动
    利用幻灯展览会等宣传生产工作，推广科学卫生知识。
    【本报讯】山西省榆次专区各县人民文化馆，一年来配合生产和当前中心工作，初步开展城乡的文化宣传活动。活动的形式主要的有放映幻灯、图片模型展览、大众黑板报、书报阅览室、工人文化补习教育等几方面。
    在幻灯方面，一年来各县共制片二七六五幅，放映二○九次，观众共达十三万以上，并在各城镇及农村巡回放映。幻灯内容包括生产、妇婴卫生、时事政策等，能密切与各个时期的中心工作，特别是与生产相结合；同时又能利用庙会或其他群众性的集会进行适当的宣传，幻灯给群众的印象是很深刻的，群众把幻灯叫作“土电影”，所到之处均受群众热烈欢迎。
    一年来各县共举行了五十五次展览，有图表漫画、实物模型等类，内容分工农业生产、时事、卫生、文化学习等方面，观众在十九万以上。各地展览中，一般发动当地农场干部、小学师生和医务人员等帮助讲解，有的还有实例表演，对群众教育意义很大。如昔阳文化馆在二区孟壁村的庙会上宣传了温汤浸种的工作，并拿实例对比了浸种不浸种的区别，消除了一部分群众不相信种籽上有病菌、怕温汤烧坏了种籽等想法，推动了浸种工作。和顺文化馆在三区乔庄村庙会上展览并宣传了今年政府生产方针和奖励生产政策，消除了部分农民的顾虑，鼓舞了生产发家的热情。特别是各县的妇婴卫生和预防传染病等展览，最受群众欢迎。许多人反映：早知道这样，少死多少人！
    大众黑板报一年来共出版一三七五次，种类有日刊、隔日刊、三日刊、五日刊等，由于词句通俗，形式活泼，有插图、歌曲、快板、小调等，群众很容易接受。
