Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 10th. More than sixty counties in the Central and Southern regions held People's Representative Conferences in May.

The People's Representative Conferences held in the counties focused on examining and implementing the people's government's various policies related to agricultural production, further promoting the completion of spring planting and sowing and the welcoming of the summer harvest by farmers in various regions. In the counties of Henan Province where land reform has already been completed, the People's Representative Conferences focused on discussing the wheat harvesting issues arising from changes in land ownership. The conferences all adhered to the principles of "whoever plants, harvests and bears the burden" and "protecting the fruits of labor," and after repeated study, determined specific methods for wheat harvesting between the original planting households and the newly allocated households. For example, the People's Representative Conferences of Ye County, Lushan, Xinzheng, Mengjin and other counties stipulated after discussion that: Wheat fields originally planted by landlords and rich peasants and then distributed to farmers should still be harvested by the original planting households. Wheat fields leased by farmers and subsequently redistributed should still be harvested by the original planting farmers; however, if the land-recipient households have processed and fertilized on this land, a certain benefit should be given to the processors after consultation between both parties. In counties such as Enshi, Xianning, and Puqi in Hubei Province, which were liberated later and where the rent reduction movement had not yet ended, some farmers did not understand the policies of the people's government sufficiently. The People's Representative Conferences in various counties focused on discussing the re-examination of rent reduction and the people's government's policies of encouraging diligence and wealth creation, guaranteeing freedom of employment, freedom of borrowing and lending, and protecting the right to labor income. They also made resolutions to eliminate farmers' concerns about changes in land ownership, etc. At the conferences in various regions, representatives were very concerned about the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's slogan in the "May Day" Labor Day celebrations that the land and property of rich peasants would not be touched in future land reform. This slogan greatly stabilized the production sentiment of people from all walks of life. At the People's Representative Conference in Duchang County, Jiangxi, many middle peasant representatives who originally had concerns immediately stated at the meeting that they would work hard to produce after returning home.

At the same time, at the conferences in various regions, past work was reviewed based on the policies of the people's government, and phenomena that violated policies were corrected. For example, at the People's Representative Conference in Xianning County, Hubei Province, representatives reflected that the Maqiao and Shuangxi districts of the county had forced grain loans and infringed on the interests of middle peasants. The county people's government immediately made corrections, apologized to the middle peasants and compensated for losses.

After the conferences in various regions concluded, the representatives who attended the meetings were immediately organized to actively convey the resolutions to the masses, and extensive publicity was carried out through district and township farmer representative meetings or village meetings. The representatives also actively assisted the government in implementing various resolutions, thus making the production sentiment of all classes increasingly stable and actively participating in production. For example, after the People's Representative Conference in Zhijiang County, Hubei Province, the farmers' ideological concerns were dispelled, and 11,500 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, which could increase the production of rice by 12,000 shi.

　　中南地区各县
    召开人民代表会议  检查农业生产政策
    【新华社汉口十日电】中南地区在五月间有六十余县召开了各界人民代表会议。
    各县召开的各界人民代表会议着重检查和贯彻执行人民政府的各项有关农业生产的政策，进一步推动了各地农民完成春耕播种和迎接夏收。在河南省已经完成土地改革的各县各界人民代表会议上，着重讨论了因地权变动而引起的收麦问题。会议均本着“谁种谁收谁负担”和“保护劳动所得”的原则，经过反复研究，确定了原种麦户与新分地户之间关于收麦的具体办法。如叶县、鲁山、新郑、孟津等县各界人民代表会议经讨论后规定：原有地主、富农自种的麦田分给农民者，仍由原下种户收割。农民承租的麦田已另行分配者，仍由原种农民收割；但分地户在此项土地上加工施肥者，应经双方协商分给加工者以一定利益。在湖北省恩施、咸宁、蒲圻等解放较晚、减租运动还未结束的县份，因尚有部分农民对人民政府的政策了解不够，各县各界人民代表会议均着重讨论复查减租和人民政府奖励勤劳致富、保证雇佣自由、借贷自由和保障劳动收益权等各项政策，并作出决议，消除了农民害怕地权变动等顾虑。各地会议上，代表们很关心中共中央在庆祝“五一”节劳动口号中提出今后土地改革中不动富农的土地财产。这一口号大大稳定了各阶层人民的生产情绪。江西都昌县各界人民代表会议上，不少原来存有顾虑的中农代表，当即在会上表示回去后一定要勤劳生产。
    同时，各地会议上都根据人民政府的政策检查过去的工作，对违反政策的现象进行了纠正。如湖北咸宁县各界代表会议上，代表反映该县马桥区、双溪区曾发生强迫借粮、侵犯中农利益的行为，该县人民政府当即进行纠正，向中农道歉并补偿损失。
    各地会议结束后，都立即组织出席会议的代表积极向群众传达决议，通过区、乡农民代表会议或村民大会，进行了广泛的宣传。代表们并积极协助政府执行各项决议，因而使各阶层生产情绪日益稳定，积极参加生产。如湖北枝江县各界代表会后，农民思想顾虑解除，开荒一万一千五百亩，可增产稻谷一万二千石。
