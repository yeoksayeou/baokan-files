　　They Conquered the Sanggan River - Model Deeds of Postal Worker Fu Sanhai and Others
　　The branch line from Datong to Hunyuan is separated by the Sanggan River. In previous years, service had to be suspended for several days during the river opening and freezing periods. The reason is that in the period before the river freezes and after it opens, there are always about ten days of ice floe (a large amount of ice floating on the river). At this time, boats cannot travel, livestock cannot cross, pedestrians are cut off, and postal services are also suspended. This year, during the river opening, postal workers Fu Sanhai, Zhang Qiye, and Feng Zhitong, along with the comrades at Jijiiazhuang station, tried various methods and finally overcame all the difficulties during the ice floe period, maintaining smooth postal delivery and preventing service interruptions. When mules were blocked and could not cross the river, the dispatch riders themselves carried fifty or sixty pounds of mail on their backs, braving the danger to cross the river and successfully complete their mission. This is worthy of praise. (Reprinted from "Beijing Postal Workers" No. 8)

　　他们战胜了桑乾河  邮工傅三海等模范事迹
    大同至浑源的支线路上，中间隔着桑乾河。历年来在开河和冻河时必须停班几天。原因是在冻河之先开河之后，总有十天左右的流凌时期（河面上漂着大量冰块）。这时船不能行，牲口也不能过，行人断绝，邮班也停顿了。今年开河时，经该路邮工傅三海、张起业、冯志通三位同志和吉家庄小站各位同志们，多方设法，终于克服了流凌时期的一切困难，保持邮递畅通，不使停班。骡子被阻不能过河时，交通员自己背上五六十斤的邮件，冒着危险渡河，胜利达成任务。这是值得表扬的。（转载《北京邮工》第八期）
