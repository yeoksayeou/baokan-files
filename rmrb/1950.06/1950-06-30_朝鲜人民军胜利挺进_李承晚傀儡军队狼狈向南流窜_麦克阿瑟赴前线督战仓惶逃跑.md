　　Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The direct intervention of U.S. imperialism in the Korean civil war has failed to prevent the victorious advance of the Korean People's Army and the collapse of the Syngman Rhee puppet army. According to the Associated Press, after receiving Truman's order to launch the invasion on the evening of the 27th, MacArthur immediately ordered the navy and air force to participate directly in the Korean civil war, and established a "U.S.-South Korean Joint Command" in Suwon, 20 kilometers south of Seoul. On the 28th, MacArthur mobilized a large number of jet fighters and bombers from bases in Japan to carry out frantic bombing and strafing of the Korean People's Army. However, the efforts of the American air pirates failed to stop the rapid advance of the People's Army. After liberating Seoul at noon on the 28th, the People's Army immediately "continued to pursue the defeated" Syngman Rhee puppet army, and had crossed Seoul, only eight miles away from "South Korea's last effective air force base," Suwon. According to an Associated Press reporter, "All kinds of vehicles flocked to Suwon from all directions, and Suwon was in a state of chaos." Suwon Airport was under the strafing of the Korean People's Air Force, and "everything was in a mess." "The remnants of the 7th and 2nd Divisions who had fled from Seoul are fleeing south in panic, and all American heavy weapons have been abandoned." The Syngman Rhee puppet government, which had just fled from Seoul to Suwon, fled south again to Daejeon, 85 miles from Seoul, on the afternoon of the 28th, and planned to flee to Daegu, 150 miles southeast of Seoul. The so-called U.S.-South Korean Joint Command is also preparing to "retreat" at any time.
　　Not only that, but the American air pirates were also powerfully struck by the Air Force of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. According to Reuters, U.S. Air Force personnel landing at Suwon Airport revealed that a total of six U.S. fighter planes were shot down on the 28th alone.
　　In the face of the rapid collapse of the Syngman Rhee gang, MacArthur flew to a certain place in South Korea in the rain this afternoon to personally supervise the battle. However, after staying for 15 hours, MacArthur fled back to Tokyo in panic that evening. According to the Associated Press, "This indicates that the situation in Korea may have taken a turn that is more serious than generally expected." However, it is worth noting that the Associated Press reporter quoted authoritative sources in the U.S. military in Tokyo as saying that due to the deterioration of the military situation, the U.S. military headquarters may send ground troops to South Korea.

　　朝鲜人民军胜利挺进
    李承晚傀儡军队狼狈向南流窜  麦克阿瑟赴前线督战仓惶逃跑
    【新华社二十九日讯】美帝国主义对朝鲜内战的直接干涉，并未能阻止朝鲜人民军的胜利进军与李承晚傀儡军队的溃败。据合众社报道：麦克阿瑟二十七日晚接得杜鲁门的发动侵略的命令后，随即命令海空军出动，直接参加朝鲜内战，并在汉城以南二十公里的水原成立一个“美韩军联合司令部”。二十八日，麦克阿瑟动员了大批喷气式战斗机及轰炸机，从日本基地出发，对朝鲜人民军进行疯狂的轰炸与扫射。但美国空中强盗的努力，并未能阻止人民军的迅速推进。人民军继二十八日午解放汉城之后，随即“继续穷追溃不成军的”李承晚傀儡军，并已越过汉城，距离“南朝鲜最后一个有力的空军基地”水原仅只八英里。据合众社记者称：“各色车辆自四面八方涌至水原、水原已混乱一片”。水原机场处在朝鲜人民空军的扫射下，“一切事情乱得一团糟”。“自汉城逃跑的第七师及第二师残余一部正仓惶失措地向南流窜，所有的美国重武器都已遗弃”。刚由汉城逃到水原的李承晚傀儡政府，又于二十八日下午向南逃到距离汉城八十五英里的大田，并打算再逃到离汉城东南一百五十英里的大邱。所谓美韩军联合司令部也准备随时“撤退”。
    不仅如此，美国的空中强盗并受到朝鲜共和国空军的有力打击。据路透社报道，在水原机场着陆的美国空军人员透露：美国战斗机在二十八日一天中，共被击落六架。
    在李承晚匪帮的迅速溃败下，麦克阿瑟曾于今日午冒雨飞往南朝鲜某地，亲自督战。但在逗留十五小时后，麦克阿瑟又仓惶于当日晚逃回东京。据美联社称：“这表示朝鲜战况可能发生了较一般预料更为严重的转折”。然而，值得注意的是，美联社记者引东京美军权威方面说，由于军事局势的恶化，美军总部可能派遣地面部队去南朝鲜。
