To meet the urgent needs of current production and construction and to train specialized personnel, Tangshan Engineering College of China Jiaotong University established six specialized courses in the autumn of last year. Tsinghua University has also successively entrusted relevant departments to establish (or jointly establish) a specialized course, a training class (both short-term), a cadre training class, and entrusted the recruitment of advanced students (long-term). The experience of running these courses proves that, under the current conditions, utilizing existing university equipment and faculty to establish specialized courses is an effective method for training a large number of technical cadres in a relatively short period of time. Moreover, it can also bring the relationship between business departments and universities closer, and there are many conveniences in solving educational funding, teaching equipment, and student internships.

The specialized courses established by Tangshan Engineering College include the Railway Route Specialized Course, the Bridge Specialized Course (both run by the Civil Engineering Department), the Locomotive Specialized Course, the Rolling Stock Specialized Course (both run by the Mechanical Engineering Department), the Railway Telecommunications Specialized Course, and the Railway Signaling Specialized Course (both run by the Electrical Engineering Department). The duration of study for each specialized course is two years, with 20 to 30 students in each course. Students must have at least a high school diploma to be admitted, and will be assigned work by the Ministry of Railways after graduation. The curriculum of the specialized courses is basically based on the specific conditions and needs of production work. General courses taught in the university undergraduate program are suspended or the teaching time is reduced, while specialized courses are added in a planned and focused manner. For example, in the Bridge Specialized Course, general physics was suspended in the first year, calculus was reduced to four hours, and courses such as Mechanics of Materials, Engineering Mechanics, and Railway Engineering were added in addition to courses such as Engineering Drawing and Surveying. In order to avoid the specialized courses simply becoming a simplified version of the university undergraduate courses, each specialized course gradually explored and improved in the teaching process, and paid special attention to internships. Students spend an average of one to two days per week on internships. Each specialized course has established close ties with the Tangshan Rolling Stock Factory of the Ministry of Railways, providing students with many conveniences for on-site internships. Over the past nine months, students in each course have made rapid progress in their studies and internships. It is expected that they will be competent for certain on-site work after graduating in two years.

The specialized courses established by Tsinghua University include the Farmland Water Conservancy Specialized Course, which was entrusted to the Civil Engineering Department by the Ministry of Agriculture, with a duration of eight months; the Meteorological Observation Personnel Training Class, which was jointly organized by the Meteorological Bureau of the Military Commission and the Department of Meteorology of the university, with a duration of five months. Most of the students in the above two courses and classes are high school graduates, and some are cadres recommended by government agencies. In addition, the Department of Chemistry established a Chemical Engineering Specialized Class, and the Departments of Physics and Electrical Engineering recruited advanced students, all entrusted by government industrial departments. The students are all in-service cadres recommended by their units, and will graduate in three or four years. Although these recommended students generally have a relatively poor foundation in mathematics, physics, and foreign languages, and encountered some difficulties in mathematics when they first entered the university, they have made rapid progress with the hard work of the students and the enthusiastic help of the teachers. The university has added English and Chemistry remedial classes for them, and improved teaching methods, avoiding lecturing in English as much as possible. The students put forward the slogan: "If others use one hour, we will use three hours to study!" They have high confidence and expect to reach the same level as undergraduate students after graduation.

The difficulties encountered by the two universities in running specialized courses and departments are that both schools and teachers lack experience in running specialized courses, and the students' levels are relatively uneven, which increases the difficulty of teaching and thus somewhat affects the teaching work of regular classes. In terms of students' thinking, some students are not content with studying in specialized courses and hope to transfer to other departments; a few students in undergraduate programs also look down on students in specialized courses. To overcome this, it is necessary to strengthen students' political education, establish their ideas of not admiring vanity, being realistic, and valuing labor and operation; on the other hand, the school should also attach importance to specialized courses and treat them at least the same as undergraduate programs in terms of faculty allocation. In addition, when industrial departments entrust universities to run specialized courses, issues such as leadership relationships and funding systems still need to be more appropriately regulated.

### 适应建设需要加速培养专材  交大清华开办专修科

　　适应建设需要加速培养专材
    交大清华开办专修科
    【本报讯】为了适应当前生产建设的迫切需要，培养专门人材，中国交通大学唐山工学院于去年秋季开办了六个专修科；清华大学亦先后由有关部门托办（或与之合办）了一个专修科、一个训练班（都是短期性的），一个干部训练班及委托招收的晋修生（长期性的）。这些科班举办的经验证明，在目前条件下，利用现有大学设备和师资开办专修科，是在较短期内培养大量技术干部的有效方法之一；而且还可使业务部门与大学的关系趋于密切，在解决教育经费、教学设备和学生实习等问题上也有不少便利。
    唐山工学院开办的有铁道路线专修科、桥梁专修科（以上为土木系办的），机车专修科、车辆专修科（以上机械系办的），铁道电讯专修科、铁道号志专修科（以上电机系办的）。各专修科修业期规定为二年，每科学生二十人至三十人不等。学生入学须有高中毕业以上程度，毕业后由铁道部分配工作。专修科的课程，基本上是根据生产工作的具体情况和需要，将大学本科所授一般课程停开或酌减授课时间，而有计划有重点地增加专门课程。如桥梁专修科一年级停开了普通物理，微积分减为四小时，并在工程画、测量等课之外，增加了材料力学、工程力学、铁路工程等课。为避免专修科的课程单纯地变为大学本科课程的简化，各专修科均在教学过程中逐步摸索改进；并特别注意了实习，学生实习时间平均每星期有一天到两天。各专修科均与铁道部唐山机厂取得了密切联系，给学生作现场实习以许多方便。九个月来，各科学生在学习上和实习中进步很快，预计两年毕业后可胜任一定的现场工作。
    清华大学开办的有农田水利专修科，由农业部委托该校土木系代办，修业期八个月；气象观测人员训练班，由军委气象局与该校气象系合办，修业期五个月；以上两科、班学生大部分为招收的高中学业学生，一部分为政府机关保送的干部。另外，化学系开办了化工专修班、物理及电机系招收了晋修生，均为政府产业部门所委托办理，学生均系保送的在职干部，三年或四年毕业。这些保送的学生，虽然一般地数理和外国文基础比较差，初入学时在数学上曾遇到一些困难，但在同学们的刻苦用功与教师的热情帮助下，进步很快。该校曾为他们增开了英文、化学补习班，并改进教学方法，尽可能避免用英文讲课。同学们提出口号：“人家用一个钟头的，我们用三个钟头学习！”信心很高，预计毕业后完全可以达到与本科学生相同的水平。
    两校开办专门科、系所遇到的困难，是学校与教师均缺乏办理专修科的经验，同学的程度比较参差，加重了教学的困难，因之也就多少影响了正规班系的教学工作。在学生的思想方面，一部分学生不安心于专修科的学习，希望转系；本科中少数学生也有瞧不起专修科同学的表现。为克服这一点，需要一面加强学生的政治教育，树立他们不慕虚荣，实事求是，重视劳动操作的思想；另一方面，学校也要重视专修科，在师资配备上，至少与本科同样看待。此外，由产业部门委托大学办理专修科时，其领导关系与经费制度等问题，也还待作更适当的规定。
