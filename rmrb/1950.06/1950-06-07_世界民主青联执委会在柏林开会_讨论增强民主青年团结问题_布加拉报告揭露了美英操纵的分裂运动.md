Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 6th: According to TASS, the Second Second Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which opened in Berlin on May 31st, held its second agenda item on the 2nd (i.e., the 3rd) and 3rd (i.e., the 4th) meetings, listening to and discussing the report by World Federation of Democratic Youth Secretary-General Bugala on "The Task of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in the Struggle to Consolidate the Ranks of Democratic Youth Worldwide."

In his report, Bugala exposed the divisive activities of the so-called "Socialist Youth International," a tool of US and British imperialism. He said: Uniting youth in the peace front, establishing joint organizations that include all youth regardless of political belief or other distinctions, and exposing the agents of imperialism are decisive prerequisites for strengthening the unity of democratic youth.

During the discussion of Bugala's report, executive committee members Wu Xueqian (China), Brock (England), Maitre (France), Bassev (Bulgaria), Bauer-Esson (France), and sixteen others reported on various measures taken by youth organizations in their respective countries to unite youth in defending world peace.

The Finnish youth representative said: The Finnish Democratic Youth League is competing with the Finnish Democratic Women's League in the peace signature campaign, striving to be the group that collects the most signatures. The Dutch youth representative reported on the preparations for the pro-peace conference to be held in the country on June 23rd. In his speech, the Austrian youth representative exposed the conspiracy of right-wing Social Democratic youth organizations to split the Austrian democratic youth movement.

The 3rd-day Executive Committee meeting also began its third agenda item, listening to a report by World Federation of Democratic Youth Secretary Hokeham on "Progress in the Preparations for the Child Welfare and Democratic Education Conference."
