    The Story of a Pencil
    Yu Zhen
    (Comic Strip) (II)
    (V) I went home and said to my dad, "I want to go to school to study." Dad sighed deeply. Mom said, "Child, our clothes are torn and we don't even have thread to sew them up!"
    (VI) Xue Yongsheng's nephew, Little Stone, who is a year younger than me, deliberately waved a fancy pencil in front of my eyes and said, "You poor people don't have money, you can't afford it."
    (VII) I ran home to ask my mom for money, but she didn't have any. So, I took the two big eggs my mom had saved and traded them with the neighbor's child for a red pencil. I treasured it like a treasure and kept it by my side.
    (VIII) One day I went to the landlord's house to work and saw a book lying on the edge of the kang. I went over and opened it to read.

    一支铅笔的故事

    （连环画）（二）
    （五）我回家跟爹说：“我要上学去读书”。爹爹低头长叹。娘说：“孩子，咱衣裳破了还没有针线缝呢！”
    （六）薛永生的侄儿小石头，比我小一岁，拿着一支花铅笔故意在我眼前晃，还说：“你们穷人没有钱，使不起”。
    （七）我跑回家找娘要钱，娘没有钱；我就把娘留下的两个大鸡蛋拿来，跟邻家小孩换了支红铅笔。它像个宝贝似的藏在我身边。
    （八）有一天我到东家上房去干活，看见一本书放在炕沿上，我走上前把它翻开来看。
