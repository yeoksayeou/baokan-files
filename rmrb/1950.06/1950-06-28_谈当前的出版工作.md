On Current Publishing Work
    Editor

    Recently, we read more than two hundred newly published social science books (including some publications from twenty-seven bookstores), and at the same time listened to talks from friends in various places who are concerned about publishing work, and read some reports on publishing work in local newspapers. We have a preliminary and relatively specific understanding of the current situation of our publishing. Here, based on these materials, we briefly discuss our opinions.

    First of all, it should be pointed out that the vast majority of our publishers are moving towards progress. The political and ideological level of books is generally gradually improving. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. Among the books published after liberation, the proportion of books with bad content is very small. Although some books have shortcomings in content, they are mostly due to the limitations of the writers' theoretical and cultural levels, and they are not intentionally distorting facts or deceiving readers.

    The tendency of publishers to strive for progress is commendable. But at the same time, it should also be pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in editing, publishing, and distribution. The most serious shortcoming is being too careless in reprinting books. Today, the number of new publications is still small and cannot meet the needs of readers. Good books published before liberation should be reprinted. However, before reprinting, a review is necessary. Some books that should have been considered good books before liberation are now considered insufficient, and may even be harmful to readers to some extent. Some books that were never considered good books in the past are still being printed by some publishers as they are. No review or revision is done in advance, and the authors are not consulted. Some authors have even made requests to publishers to modify or add to the books, but publishers, out of concern for costs, are unwilling to reset the type and still reprint the original version. This should not be done. On the other hand, some authors should also bear some responsibility. The authors should know the content of the books they write. If they find that the books they wrote in the past have problems, they should proactively notify the publishers to stop reprinting or revise them before reprinting. However, some authors do not seem to be doing this. Secondly, in the translated books, the translations are often awkward and difficult to read (we have not been able to compare them with the original texts to see if there are any mistranslations, so we will not discuss them). Translating books from the Soviet Union and Eastern European New Democratic countries and absorbing the construction experience of advanced countries is an extremely important task today. We hope that translators will work hard to improve their skills and do this work better. Thirdly, the proofreading work of books, except for a few bookstores such as Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, and Kaiming Bookstore, which are more serious, is generally too careless. Many incorrectly printed words and punctuation errors have not been corrected. Finally, what we want to say is that the tendency of publishers to compile and print books with a division of labor is not yet very obvious. The situation of simply striving for business interests without purpose and direction still exists in some bookstores. It is true that it is still impossible to make excessively high demands on general publishers today; however, to do a good job in publishing, division of labor and specialization are necessary. Without specialization, the quality of publications cannot be improved. We hope that publishers can pay attention to this issue, assess their own subjective strengths, and coordinate with the needs of the entire country to begin preparing for specialization. The division of labor and specialization of publishing is the path that the people's publishing事业 should take, and there is no doubt about that.

    The following is a discussion of distribution work. It is also a major task for publishers to disseminate excellent books and periodicals in a timely and universal manner and reach the hands of readers. It is very wrong to neglect this work. This mainly includes promotion and distribution. Promotion work is to use an honest attitude and effective methods to let readers know what good books have been published so that readers can buy and read them. This work was done very carefully by Mr. Zou Taofen when he was in charge of Life Bookstore. It is hoped that general distributors can learn this excellent style and carry it forward. At present, the distribution work of general progressive bookstores is considered insufficient. Good books have been published, but they have not been able to attract the attention of readers. Storefront work and mail order work are often also poor and cannot satisfy readers. Some time ago, I heard a sentence from a Soviet friend: "Books piled up in the warehouse are like fish晒 in the sun, which is a very sad sight." This is a very profound sentence. People who do distribution work should keep it in mind. Of course, only good books should be promoted and distributed, not bad books. Some irresponsible publishers are exaggerating bad books and deceiving readers. For example, the "Ci Yuan" published by Shanghai Qingguang Bookstore is not only randomly and vulgarly selected, but also has many political errors. However, the bookstore publishes large advertisements in local newspapers to attract readers. This approach should be opposed.

    In recent months, the atmosphere of criticism in the publishing industry has gradually unfolded. Shanghai Dagongbao has added a "Reading and Publishing" column. Other local newspapers and magazines have paid considerable attention to the work of book review and evaluation. This is a very good phenomenon. Criticism and self-criticism are the most powerful weapons for promoting work. It is hoped that everyone who cares about cultural construction and the vast number of readers will enthusiastically participate in the criticism work of the publishing industry.

　　谈当前的出版工作
    编者
    最近我们读了两百多种新出版的社会科学书籍（包括二十七家书店的部分出版物），同时听了各地关心出版工作的朋友们的谈话，看了各地报纸上一些关于出版工作的报导，对当前我们的出版情况有了初步的、比较具体的了解。这里根据这些材料，简略地谈谈我们的意见。
    首先应该指出的，我们绝大多数的出版业者都在向进步的道路走。书籍的政治思想水平一般地在逐渐提高。这是很可喜的现象。在解放后出版的书籍中，内容恶劣的书籍所占的比率很小。有些书籍，内容虽然有缺点，大都是写作者受着理论水平和文化水平的限制，并不是存心歪曲事实，欺蒙读者。
    出版家努力求进步的倾向是值得赞扬的。但同时也应该指出，在编辑、出版、发行种种方面，缺点依然很多。最严重的缺点是印重版书太不谨慎。今天，新出版物数量还不多，不能供给读者的需要，解放前出版的好书，应当重版。可是在重版之前，总得经过一番检查的工作。有些书籍，在解放前应该认作好书的，在今天就嫌不够了，甚至于在某种程度上对读者有害了。有的即使在从前也不能认作好书的，可是有些出版家还是照样在印。事前并不经过检查、修订，也不去问一问作者。甚至有的作者向出版家提出了修改或增订的要求，出版家为了顾虑成本，不愿重排，还是照原版翻印了。这是不应该的。另一方面，一部分作者也该担负一些责任。作者自己写的书，内容如何应该知道。发觉从前写的书有问题，就应该主动地通知出版家停止重印。或者经过了修正再印。然而某些作者似乎并没有这样做。其次，翻译的书籍，译文很多生硬难读（内容是否有误译，我们没有能够对照原文，只好不谈）。翻译苏联和东欧新民主主义国家的书籍，吸收先进国家的建设经验，在今天是一种极其重要的工作。我们希望翻译工作者努力提高自己的修养，把这工作做得更好一些。再次，书籍的校对工作，除了商务、中华、开明等少数书店比较认真以外，一般都嫌太粗疏，误植的字和标点符号上的错误很多没校正。最后要说的，是各出版家编印书籍，分工的倾向还不大看得出来。单纯争取营业利益，漫无目的和方向的情形，在某些书店中依然存在。这在今天，固然还不可能向一般出版家提出过高的要求；可是要做好出版工作，分工和专业化是必要的。不专业化，出版物的质量就无法提高。我们希望出版家能注意到这个问题，各自审度主观的力量，配合整个国家的需要，开始作专业化的准备。出版的分工和专业化，是人民出版事业应走的道路，那是无可怀疑的。
    以下谈谈发行工作。把优良的书刊及时地普遍地传播出去，达到读者的手里，同样是出版业者的重大任务。轻视这一工作是非常错误的。这里面主要包含着推广、发行两大项目。推广工作，是用诚实的态度和有效的方法来使读者知道有什么好书出版，好让读者来购买阅读。这项工作，从前邹韬奋先生主持生活书店的时候是做得很周到的。希望一般的发行工作者都能够学习这个优良作风，并且加以发扬光大。现在一般进步的书店，发行工作都嫌做得不够。出版了好书，没有能够引起读者的注意。门市工作和邮购工作往往也很差，不能使读者满意。前一些时候，听到一位苏联朋友的一句话：“书籍堆在仓库里，好比鱼晒在太阳里，是很凄惨的景象。”这是句极深刻的话。做发行工作的人，应该牢记在心头才是。当然，应该努力推广、发行的只是好书，决不是坏书。有些不负责的出版家，在把坏书大吹大擂，欺骗读者。例如上海青光书局出版的《辞渊》，不但取材很杂乱庸俗，而且政治上的错误很多。该书局却在各地方报纸上大登广告，吸引读者。这种作风是应当反对的。
    这几个月来，出版界的批评风气逐渐展开了。上海大公报已增辟了《读书与出版》栏。其他各地报纸和杂志中对书刊评介的工作都已相当注意。这是很好的现象。批评与自我批评是推进工作最有力的武器，希望每一个关心文化建设的人和广大的读者，都热烈地来参加出版界的批评工作。
