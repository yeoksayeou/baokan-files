    苏联小朋友热烈献花充满了国际友爱精神
    大会播送了朱副主席向大会小朋友们讲话的录音片，随后有吴晗副市长的讲话、中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若的献诗、全国妇联副主席邓颖超和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬的讲话。他们都勉励小朋友们要好好学习，锻炼身体，长大了好把伟大的祖国建设得更美丽。
    大会中充满了国际主义的友爱精神。当二十多个天真活泼的苏联小朋友向主席团献花时，全场热烈鼓掌，中国的母亲们把苏联小朋友们抱起来，苏联的母亲们也把中国小朋友抱起来。大会主席接着宣读了印尼工人中央组织代表团给中华全国民主妇联向中国母亲们的致敬电。大会于最后通过了向毛主席、斯大林大元帅致敬电及向全世界小朋友的贺电。会后中国、苏联、朝鲜的儿童们都表演了游艺节目。（附图片）
