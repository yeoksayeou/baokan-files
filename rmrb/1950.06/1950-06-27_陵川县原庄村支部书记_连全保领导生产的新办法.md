　　Lian Quanbao, the Communist Party Branch Secretary of Yuanzhuang Village in Lingchuan County, Shanxi, is an outstanding labor hero. During this year's spring plowing and sowing, he created new experiences for the branch to lead production based on the new situation in the countryside. As a result, the village's production work achieved great success this spring. Of the 43 party members in the entire branch, 35 were able to unite the masses well and engage in production, with only two party members not playing a role. A large number of labor heroes and activists emerged among the masses. Eighty percent of the village's autumn fields were plowed twice, and 15 percent were plowed three times. Each mu (Chinese unit of area, approx. 0.165 acres) was fertilized with 70 dan (Chinese unit of dry measure, approx. 50 kg) of fertilizer. Good results were also achieved in promoting improved varieties and improving farming techniques. Except for six households with 24 mu of land, the entire village carried out warm water seed soaking, and some implemented chemical seed dressing; the area under improved varieties such as Golden Queen and Baiyanggu increased by 950 mu compared to last year. These achievements are inseparable from the new leadership methods of branch secretary Lian Quanbao. On June 4th, the Pingcheng District Committee of Lingchuan County convened a party congress. At the meeting, Lian Quanbao introduced his leadership experience in detail, which was warmly welcomed by all the representatives, and called for a movement to study Lian Quanbao's new experience in leading production.

　　The new method of production leadership in Yuanzhuang Village first learned to use people's representatives conferences at all levels to implement the party's policies, unite and promote the masses of all strata to step up production. In using people's representative conferences to lead production, the branch has gained two experiences:

　　That is, it is necessary to attach great importance to and respect the opinions of the people's representatives conferences, and to adhere to the correct opinions of the party in appropriate ways. Once, when a people's representatives conference was held, most of the branch's suggestions were adopted, except for the tree planting plan. The branch suggested planting two trees per person, but the people's representatives conference advocated one tree per person. The branch checked and found that its own suggestion was correct, so through the party member representatives in the people's representatives conference, it repeatedly explained, starting from the advantages and disadvantages of tree planting to enlighten everyone to recognize the correctness of the tree planting plan. Finally, the people's representatives conference passed the plan of planting two trees per person. This method of patiently persuading and explaining, seriously adhering to correct opinions, and implementing the party's policies and guidelines is good. This not only respected the opinions of the people's representatives conference, but also implemented the party's resolutions, and at the same time enabled the representatives to truly recognize the correctness of the party's opinions ideologically. After the meeting, Lian Quanbao immediately convened a branch committee meeting, calling on all party members to continue to lead the masses from action to realize the party's resolutions, and party members should become models for implementing the party's and the people's representatives conference's resolutions. Lian Quanbao first led his family of eight to plant 59 trees, exceeding the branch's plan by three times. Party members Wang Jinshan and Wang Fashan helped the masses cut and plant trees. As a result, the entire village planted 3,783 trees, exceeding the original plan by 1,131 trees.

　　During the second people's representatives conference in the village, Lian Quanbao discovered that the representatives had a tendency to follow the crowd in discussing issues, and immediately conducted detailed research within the party, and found that the main reason was that there were too many party member representatives. After discussion by the branch, it was decided that seven party members would withdraw from the people's representatives conference, and seven non-party representatives would be re-elected. In the re-election, special attention was paid to representation: a well-to-do middle peasant, two middle peasants (who had been wrongly struggled against), two old middle peasants, and two women who were the best laborers were selected. At the representatives meeting, the branch repeatedly publicized and explained the party's policy of rewarding production, which greatly inspired the production enthusiasm of all strata.

　　Second, give full play to the collective leadership of the branch committee. When the branch arranges any work, it first deliberates and discusses within the branch committee to make everyone's understanding consistent. For example, when Lian Quanbao returned to the village from the county party congress this spring to arrange the branch's leadership of production work, branch committee member Wang Jinshan could not understand the leadership of production. He believed that it was difficult for the branch committee to lead production: if they spoke lightly, the masses would not listen; if they spoke heavily, it would reflect that their work style was not good; he also believed that leading the masses to produce would delay his own affairs, and he would be impoverished if the masses became rich. At this time, the deputy branch secretary proposed to hold a branch meeting, and Lian Quanbao said: "Our branch committee members have not yet reached a consensus, how can we hold a branch meeting?" Therefore, it was decided to postpone the convening of the branch meeting. After returning home, Quanbao thought about it and analyzed the ideological situation of branch committee member Wang Jinshan, and believed that his main problem was the ideological troubles after the revolution, which lowered the communist party member's thinking to the ideological level of ordinary peasants. Early the next morning, he personally used the method of talking about his thoughts to explain to Wang Jinshan the arduous history of the Party climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands, and explained that the Party members' leadership of the masses in production and their own production were not contradictory, and the importance of the Party leading the masses in production to change from an agricultural country to an industrial country. After more than a day of mobilization, the branch committee meeting was reconvened. At the meeting, the leadership of the branch committee was examined in connection with the arrangement of work. With Quanbao's help, Wang Jinshan's thinking became clear. He made a self-criticism to the party members at the branch meeting for his mistake of only caring about his own production and being unwilling to lead the masses in production; and expressed his attitude and determination to correct it. Party members Xu Yingui, Yuan Renhua and others said: "As long as Wang Jinshan gets up to work, we will all get up to work." And they proposed to compete with Jinshan. Quanbao seized this opportunity to help everyone launch a revolutionary competition movement for party members to lead the masses in production.

　　Third, be good at uniting labor heroes and activists, and improve production techniques. In improving technology, he can also deeply discover the ideological concerns of the masses, and patiently persuade them to eliminate obstacles. After Quanbao participated in the county labor hero conference, he immediately held a village labor hero activist meeting of 64 people. At the meeting, they compared technologies, exchanged experiences, studied scientific knowledge, and mobilized everyone to fight against insect pests. After such mobilization, the masses automatically reported 363 mu of land with insect pests (earthworms, stem borers, etc.) and asked labor heroes to help eliminate the pests. The masses also respectfully called the labor heroes insect-killing teachers. When promoting the double-legged seed drill to sow millet, it was found that Yuan Shuang's mother was ideologically conservative, did not believe in the technology, and was afraid that using the double-legged drill would reduce grain production. Quanbao seized the old woman's demand for "more grain production," and repeatedly explained to her that if you want to produce more grain, you must first pay attention to technology, and gave the old lady a guarantee, saying: "If you apply enough fertilizer and pay attention to technology, I will be responsible if you produce less grain." But the old woman's thinking was still not clear. She always thought that if one leg was missing from the three-legged stool, one-third of the grain would be reduced, and she did not think about the result of the two-legged drill sowing, which would allow ventilation and strong seedlings. Quanbao was not discouraged by this. He continued to explain, and used drawing lines on the ground to explain the relationship between the distance of the seedlings, the land fertility, and the growth. In this way, the old lady suddenly realized and used a two-legged drill to sow all five mu of millet. Quanbao's tireless work style in improving technology is deeply welcomed by the masses of the village.

　　Because Lian Quanbao studied the new situation in the old revolutionary base areas of the countryside, he clarified that in the case of the end of the war and the relative reduction of labor and livestock difficulties, the main demand of the masses is to improve technology. Therefore, he said that if party members want to lead production, they must pay attention to improving technology. The consolidation of mutual aid teams must also be combined with the improvement of technology. The reason why the mutual aid team he leads has been able to persist for six years is mainly because of this. For example, this year his team has set a plan to produce 12 shi (Chinese unit of dry measure, approx. 100 liters) and 5 dou (Chinese unit of dry measure, approx. 10 liters) more grain. He summed up from the past years of farming that if you want to increase production, you must sow in a timely manner. For example, if you sow Golden Queen jade dumplings, half of those sown in Qingming (solar term, around April 5th) in 1947 will mature; two-thirds of those sown in Guyu (solar term, around April 20th) in 1948 will mature; and those sown after Guyu in 1949 will mature with other crops. This year, in order to achieve timely sowing, the whole team was mobilized to cultivate and sow according to the 1949 method.

　　陵川县原庄村支部书记
    连全保领导生产的新办法
    山西陵川县原庄村中共支部书记连全保是一个出色的劳动英雄。在今年春耕下种中他根据农村的新情况创造了支部领导生产的新经验。因此今春原庄村全村生产工作得到很大成绩。全支部四十三个党员中有三十五个能很好团结群众进行生产，只有两个党员不起作用。在群众中涌现了大批的劳动英雄与积极分子。全村秋田耕两遍的占百分之八十，耕三遍的占百分之十五。每亩均上肥七十担。在推广优良品种及改进耕作技术上均有很好的成绩。全村除六户二十四亩地外全部进行了温汤浸种，有的则实行了药剂拌种；金皇后，白洋谷等优良品种比去年多推广了九百五十亩。这些成绩的取得和支部书记连全保的新的领导方法是分不开的。六月四日，陵川县平城区委召开党代会议。会上连全保详细的介绍了他的领导经验，受到了全体代表的热烈欢迎。并号召开展学习连全保领导生产的新经验运动。
    原庄村支部领导生产的新方法中，首先是学会了运用各界人民代表会议贯彻党的政策，团结并推动各阶层群众加紧生产。在运用人代会领导生产方面，支部已取得两点经验：
    就是必须十分重视与尊重人代会的意见，并以适当方式坚持党的正确意见。有一次开人代会时，支部的建议人代会大多通过了，就是植树计划未通过。支部建议每人种二株，但人代会主张每人一株。支部检查自己的建议是正确的，因此通过人代会中的党员代表再三解释，从植树利害上去启发大家认识植树计划的正确，最后人代会通过了每人植树二株的计划。这种以耐心说服解释的方法，认真坚持正确意见，贯彻党的政策方针的方法是好的。这，既尊重了人代会意见，又贯彻了党的决议，同时使代表们真正从思想上认识了党的意见的正确。会后，连全保立即召开了支委会，号召全体党员要继续从行动中带动群众实现党的决议，党员要成为执行党与人代会决议的模范。连全保并首先带起全家八口人植树五十九株，超过支部计划三倍。党员王金山、王发山等并帮助群众砍树栽树。结果全村植树三千七百八十三株，超过原计划一千一百三十一株。
    该村在第二次人代会时，连全保发现了代表们在讨论问题中有随波逐流现象，立即在党内详细研究，发现了主要原因是党员代表太多。经支部讨论决定，党员在人代会内退出七席，补选非党代表七人。补选中并特别注意了代表性：选了一个富裕中农，两个中农（被错斗过的），两个老中农，两个劳动最好的妇女。在代表会上支部反复宣传解释党的奖励生产政策，对各阶层的生产热情启发很大。
    第二、充分发挥支委的集体领导力量。在支部布置任何工作时，首先在支委中酝酿讨论使大家认识一致。如今春连全保从县党代会回村布置支部领导生产工作时，支委王金山对领导生产就想不通。他认为支委领导生产很困难：说的轻了群众不听，说的重了反映咱作风不好；他还认为领导群众生产会误了自己的事，群众发了家自己要受穷。这时副支书提出要开支部会，连全保就说：“咱们支委中思想还不通，怎能开支部会呢？”于是决定暂缓召开支部会。全保回家后左思右想分析了支委王金山的思想情况，认为他主要是革命成功思想在作祟，把共产党员思想降低到了一般农民的思想水平。第二天一早，他便亲自用谈心思的办法向王金山说明党爬雪山过草地的艰苦历史，并说明党员领导群众生产和自己生产并不矛盾，以及党领导群众生产由农业国变为工业国的重要。经过了一天多的动员才又召开支委会。会上结合布置工作检查了支委的领导。王金山在全保的帮助下思想通了。他在支部大会上向党员检讨了自己只顾个人生产，不愿领导群众生产的错误；并表明态度决心改正。党员徐银贵，原仁花等说：“只要王金山起来干，我们就都起来干。”并提出要和金山比赛。全保抓住这个时机，帮助大家展开了党员领导群众生产的革命竞赛运动。
    第三、善于团结劳动英雄积极分子，提高生产技术。在改进技术中并能深入发现群众思想顾虑，耐心说服排除障碍。全保参加了县劳英会后，回村立即开了六十四人的村劳动英雄积极分子会。在会上比技术，比经验，研究科学知识，并发动大家向虫害作斗争。经过这样的发动，群众自动报出病虫害地三百六十三亩（土蚕、钻心虫等）要求劳动英雄想法帮助除虫。群众并把劳动英雄们尊称为杀虫老师。在推广双腿耧种谷时，发现了原双的母亲思想保守，不相信技术，怕用双腿耧少打粮食。全保就抓住这位老人“多打粮食”的要求，再三向她解释要想多打粮食必须先讲究技术才行，并给老太太提出保证说：“要是上到肥，讲到技术，少打了粮食我负责。”但老人思想仍然不通，总认为三条腿少了一条，就要少打三分之一的粮食，而不从两条腿耧种的结果通风苗壮上去想。全保并不因此灰心。他继续解释，并在地上用划道办法说明苗的距离，地力与生长的关系。这样老太太才恍然大悟，把五亩谷全部用两条腿耧耩种。全保在改进技术工作上的这种诲人不倦的作风，深受全村群众的欢迎。
    因为连全保研究了老区农村的新情况，他明确了在战争结束，劳畜力困难相对减少的情况下，群众的要求主要是改进技术。因之他说党员要领导生产，必须注意改进技术。互助组的巩固也必须和改进技术相结合。他领导的互助组所以能坚持六年，这是主要原因之一。如今年他组订计划要多打粮食十二石五斗。他就从历年的耕作中，总结出要想增产必须适时下种的经验。如种金皇后玉茭，一九四七年清明下种的成熟一半；一九四八年谷雨种的成熟三分之二；一九四九年谷雨后种的和其他庄稼一齐成熟。今年为了作到适时下种，发动了全组都按一九四九年办法耕种。
