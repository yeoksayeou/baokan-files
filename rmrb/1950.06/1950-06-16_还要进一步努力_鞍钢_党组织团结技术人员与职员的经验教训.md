　　Further Efforts Needed
　　Lessons Learned from the "Anshan Iron and Steel" Party Organization in Uniting Technical Personnel and Clerical Staff
　　中共鞍山市委会 (CPC Anshan Municipal Committee)

　　Anshan Iron and Steel Company currently has 5,702 technical personnel and clerical staff cadres, including 873 technical personnel (technical personnel promoted from workers are not included). Among them, 102 joined after "August 15th" [end of WWII in Asia]; 771 joined or were recently recruited after 1949, with the newly arrived accounting for 88%. Only 19 members of the Communist Party are among all the technical personnel, accounting for slightly more than 2%. The number of members of the Communist Youth League and those participating in the trade union is also very small. Among the 4,829 clerical staff, the vast majority are newly joined, and there are also very few Party and League members. These personnel come from various sources. Except for a small number who have undergone short-term studies in Guannei [areas within the Great Wall], most have not received political education.

　　These technical personnel and clerical staff can be roughly divided into three types: One type was already at Anshan Iron and Steel during the puppet Manchukuo or Kuomintang reactionary rule. Most are proficient in their business and can also get along well with the workers, but they have complacency and are technically conservative. Another type is promoted from veteran workers. They have a lower level of education, but are experienced in operation, and have been very active in various movements. And most of them have become Party members. But there are still individuals who blindly worship the puppet Manchukuo system, and still take a skeptical attitude towards the technical opinions of Soviet experts. The third type is recently joined or recruited from the South. Some of them are looking for a job, so they have an employment mentality and a sojourner mentality; others admire the rich mineral deposits in the Northeast and come with an admiring attitude. When they come, they have great hopes for Anshan Iron and Steel Company, but after coming they feel that it is completely different from what they thought, and they gradually become dissatisfied. However, the vast majority come to learn skills and do work, so they are active and serious about their work, and some even ask to join the Party.

　　The Anshan Municipal Committee of the CPC has issued two instructions successively in order to unite these technical personnel and clerical staff, but because they have not been carefully checked and urged, some factories have done it, and some factories have not done it at all. Moreover, the Party organizations, trade unions, and Communist Youth League of most factories have not paid attention to this issue, so they have not corrected some things that violated the principle of unity in a timely manner. For example, some people call certain technical personnel "Three Dynasties Veterans" and "Two Dynasties Veterans." Some people do not go to the shop floor to criticize technical personnel directly, but sarcastically say to them: "You have worn out your chairs." As a result, some technical personnel and clerical staff are uneasy, depressed, and disappointed, feeling that they have no support, dare not speak their minds, and reduce their production enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for production. As a result, some technical negligence accidents occurred, such as: the stove tire being burned down by the preparatory furnace in January, resulting in a loss of more than 100 million yuan, and affecting production. In February, gas rushed out of the power plant, fumigating 16 people and killing 2.

　　Later, the higher-level Party committee conveyed Comrade Gao Gang's report at the Northeast Party Congress, and in conjunction with the situation in Anshan, pointed out that in addition to uniting workers, the Party in Anshan City must also take on the task of uniting, transforming and educating technical personnel and clerical staff. The second Party Congress of Anshan City also pointed out the importance of actively uniting, transforming, and educating technical personnel. In its work in May and June, the Anshan Municipal Committee listed uniting technical personnel and clerical staff as one of the central tasks. The Municipal Committee successively held several symposiums for technical personnel and clerical staff, and appropriately solved some ideological and livelihood problems of the technical personnel and clerical staff. A joint meeting of the secretaries of the Party committees and general branches was also held to discuss how to unite technical personnel and clerical staff. In order to strengthen the political study of technical personnel, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee, in addition to formulating a study plan, also compiled a "Reference Materials for Political Study for Technical Personnel" and distributed it to technical personnel as study materials.

　　After this effort, some technical personnel began to show their active role in production. For example, before January, the proportion of unqualified products in the steelmaking plant was 25%. After the cooperation of technical personnel and workers, by the first half of May, this phenomenon was basically eliminated. Their attitude towards the workers has also changed. Some often work with workers to study and overcome operational difficulties and give workers technical and cultural lessons.

　　However, most technical personnel and clerical staff still have the following shortcomings:

　　1. Lack of the idea of ​​relying on the working class. The idea of ​​relying on the strength of workers to promote production is very unclear. They generally treat workers with old eyes and want to use "power" to manage workers' production. Therefore, they demand that the factory give them "power" and strengthen the "power" of technical personnel. This idea seriously hinders technical personnel from humbly studying and improving production technology with workers; humbly learning practical experience from workers and enriching their book knowledge. And after accidents and problems occur, they have to look up books, but sometimes they cannot solve the problem from the books. And after an accident occurs, they are good at shirking responsibility, such as saying: This is a management problem, a responsibility problem, not a technical problem. Therefore, some workers look down on technical personnel.

　　2. Employment mentality and sojourner mentality. There is such a thing: After they read the Northeast Bureau's instructions on further uniting technical personnel and clerical staff in public enterprises, they generally paid attention to the pronouns "we" and "they" in the instructions, and some were very sad because of this. Some even questioned: "What does 'they' mean? Does it also refer to technical personnel who have joined the Party and the League as 'they'?" Some said: "If you want to unite, you must first clarify 'they' and 'we'." At the same time, they are very concerned about the amount of salary and the size of the position. They also pay close attention to qualifications and conditions such as university, elementary school, Guannei, Guanwai [outside the Great Wall], first comer, late comer, South, and North.

　　3. They are willing to study politics, but their attitude toward learning is not honest. Some boast that they have studied "Capital" and "History of the CPSU (B)" and the Municipal Committee's pamphlets are worth studying. Others simply oppose political study, and they openly say: "Even if you don't study politics, you can still serve the people!"

　　4. Some people still worship the production technology of capitalist countries, but they are prejudiced against the production technology of the advanced socialist country, the Soviet Union, and are unwilling to adopt the technical opinions of Soviet experts, insisting on the outdated capitalist set.

　　The Anshan Municipal Committee is now further strengthening the unity, education, and transformation of technical personnel and clerical staff. And summed up the following lessons:

　　First, in the past, uniting technical personnel and clerical staff was limited to the upper level. In the future, every Party member must be mobilized and combined with the broad masses of workers to form a mass unity of the whole Party. In the past, not enough was done in this regard, which made technical personnel and clerical staff still feel uneasy and disappointed, affecting their production enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for production. In the future, every Party member must learn to make friends with technical personnel and clerical staff, hold chats, promptly understand their ideological situation, and conduct necessary propaganda and explanation work to eliminate the estrangement with them, especially should quickly eliminate the sojourner mentality of "we" and "they" that still exists today. Every Party member must have a plan to help technical personnel and clerical staff make progress and establish a realistic style of serving the people. In the past, it was wrong for some Party members not to approach them because they were proud, arrogant, and aloof. It was also wrong to abandon their leadership responsibility because they could not be commanded to work for a while. The more these situations exist, the more we must adhere to the policy of uniting, educating and transforming them.

　　Second, administratively, they must be boldly used. In the past, there were some concerns, always afraid of not doing well and having problems. Facts have proved that the more you dare to boldly hand over tasks to them, the more you can strengthen their sense of responsibility and the more you can make them carefully complete the tasks. On the other hand, as long as we strengthen the inspection and supervision work, we can make the work move forward. In addition, we should encourage them to go deep into the scene more often. And encourage them to participate in mass work (they should be absorbed into the trade union), establish close relationships with workers, learn from the workers' strengths, and change their own work style. At the same time, workers should also be organized to learn technology from them.

　　Third, lead them to study in a planned way, mainly to study politics, improve their political consciousness, and establish a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people. In order to make the study better, active members among them can be absorbed to participate in the study leadership. This can make the study plan and study system that are formulated more suitable for their requirements.

　　Fourth, strengthen their education in internationalism and patriotism, so that they can humbly learn technology from Soviet experts and abandon the outdated capitalist set.

### 还要进一步努力  “鞍钢”党组织团结技术人员与职员的经验教训

　　还要进一步努力
    “鞍钢”党组织团结技术人员与职员的经验教训
    中共鞍山市委会
    鞍山钢铁公司现有技术人员和职员干部五千七百零二名。其中技术人员八百七十三名（由工人提拔的技术人员尚未计算在内）。其中在“八一五”以后参加的一百零二人；一九四九年以后或最近招聘来的七百七十一人，新来的占百分之八十八。在全部技术人员中共产党员只有十九名，占百分之二强。青年团员及参加工会的人数也很少。在四千八百二十九名职员中，绝大部分是新参加的，并且，党、团员也很少。以上这些人员来自各方，除少数在关内经过短期学习外，大多数没受过政治教育。
    这些技术人员与职员，大致可分为三种：一种是从伪满或国民党反动统治时期就在鞍钢的，多数精通业务，也还能和工人打成一片；但存在着自满情绪，对技术保守。再一种是老工人提拔起来的。他们文化程度较低，但操作有经验，在各种运动中表现很积极。并且大多数已成为党员。但还有个别盲目崇拜伪满一套，而对苏联专家的技术意见也还采取怀疑态度。第三种是最近参加的或由南方招聘来的。他们中有的是因为寻找职业，所以存有雇佣观点和作客思想；有的是羡慕东北矿藏丰富，抱着欣赏态度而来，来时对鞍山钢铁公司希望很大，来后觉得和自己所想的完全不同，也就逐渐不满起来。但是绝大部分是为学本领、做工作而来的，因此对工作积极认真，有的还要求参加党。
    鞍山市委曾为团结这些技术人员和职员，先后发过两次指示，但因没有认真检查和督促，所以有的厂作了，有的厂根本没有作。并且大多数工厂的党组织、工会和青年团对这问题没有引起注意，因而对一些违反团结原则的事情也没及时纠正。如有人叫某些技术人员为“三朝元老”和“二朝元老”，有人对技术人员不下场子，并不正面批评，却讥讽他们说：“你们把椅子都坐烂了。”以致某些技术人员和职员情绪不安，苦闷失望，感到没有依靠，有话不敢说，减低了生产热情与对生产的责任心。因此发生了一些技术上的疏忽事故，如：一月间预备炉烧毁炉胎，损失一亿多元，并影响了生产。二月间发电厂煤气冲出熏倒十六人，死二人。
    以后上级党委传达了高岗同志在东北党代会上的报告，并结合鞍山情况，指出鞍山市的党除了团结工人以外，还要担负起团结改造技术人员与职员的任务。鞍山第二次党代会上又指出了主动团结改造教育技术人员的重要性。鞍山市委在五、六月份的工作中，就将团结技术人员与职员作为中心工作之一。市委接连举行了几次技术人员与职员座谈会，适当地解决了技术人员与职员思想上和生活上的一些问题。又召开了各党委、总支书记的联席会议，讨论如何进行团结技术人员与职员的问题。市委宣传部为了加强技术人员的政治学习，除制订学习计划外，并选编了一本“技术人员政治学习参考资料”发给技术人员作学习材料。
    经过这一努力，部分技术人员在生产中开始表现了自己的积极作用。如炼铁厂一月以前产品中不合格的占百分之二十五，经过技术人员与工人的合作，至五月份上半月止，基本上消灭了这种现象。他们对工人的态度也有所转变了。有的经常和工人在一起研究和克服操作上的困难和给工人上技术课，上文化课。
    但是，大多数技术人员和职员还存在着下面一些缺点：
    一、缺乏依靠工人阶级的思想。对于依靠工人力量去推进生产的思想是很不明确的，一般还以旧的眼光对待工人，要用“权力”来管理工人生产。因此要求厂方给予“权力”和加强技术人员的“权力”。这一思想严重阻碍了技术人员虚心与工人一起研究与改进生产技术；虚心向工人学习实际经验，充实自己书本知识。而在发生事故与问题后，又不得不翻阅书本，有时却又不能从书本上解决问题。且在发生事故后，又好推卸责任，如说：这是管理问题、责任问题、而非技术问题。因此有些工人也就瞧不起技术人员了。
    二、雇佣观点与作客思想。有这么一件事情：他们在读到东北局关于进一步团结公营企业中技术人员与职员指示后，普遍的对指示中的“我们”和“他们”的代名词很注意，有的因此很伤心。有的还质问：“‘他们’是什么意思？是否对参加了党、团的技术人员也称‘他们’呢？”有的说：“要团结，先得把‘他们’和‘我们’搞清楚。”同时他们对薪金多少，职位大小非常计较。又非常注意大学、小学，关里、关外，先来、后来，南方、北方等资格和条件。
    三、愿意学习政治而学习态度却并不老实。有些吹嘘自己学过“资本论”、“联共党史”，市委的小册子还值得学习。另有些人根本反对政治学习，他们公开说：“不学习政治，还不是一样为人民服务了！”
    四、有一些人还崇拜资本主义国家的生产技术，而对先进的社会主义国家苏联的生产技术抱有成见，不愿采纳苏联专家对技术上的意见，坚持落后的资本主义的一套。
    鞍山市委现正进一步加强团结教育改造技术人员与职员。并总结出以下几点经验教训：
    第一，过去团结技术人员与职员，还限于在上层，今后要发动每个党员和结合广大工人群众，形成全党的群众性的团结。过去在这方面作的很不够，使技术人员、职员仍感到不安，失望，影响到他们的生产热忱，和对生产的责任心。今后每个党员，必须学会和技术人员与职员交朋友，开漫谈会，及时了解他们的思想情况，进行必要的宣传解释工作，消除与他们的隔阂，特别应当迅速的消除至今还存在着的“我们”和“他们”的作客思想。每个党员要有计划的帮助技术人员和职员进步，建立为人民服务的实事求是的作风。过去有些党员因为他们骄傲自大，清高孤僻而不接近他们是不对的，又因为工作上一时指挥他们不动而放弃了对他们的领导责任，也是不对的。越在这些情况下，越要坚持对他们的团结教育改造的方针。
    第二，行政上要对他们敢于大胆使用。过去曾有一些顾虑，总怕作不好，出问题。事实证明越是敢于大胆交给他们任务，越能加强他们的责任感，越能使他们细心地来完成任务。另一方面，只要加强检查督促工作，就能使工作得以前进。此外，要多鼓励他们深入现场。并鼓励他们参加群众工作（应吸收他们参加工会），与工人建立密切关系，学习工人的长处，转变自己的作风。同时，亦应组织工人向他们学习技术。
    第三，有计划的领导他们学习，主要学习政治，提高他们的政治觉悟，建立为人民服务的革命人生观。为使学习的更好，可以吸收他们中间的积极分子参加学习领导。这样可以使订出来的学习计划，学习制度，更适合于他们的要求。
    第四，加强对他们的国际主义与爱国主义的教育，使他们虚心的向苏联专家学习技术，抛弃落后的资本主义的一套。
