　　To Improve Farmers' Scientific Knowledge and Summarize Farming Experience:
    Agricultural University Establishes Model Worker Class
    Ge Hetang and Others from Changzhi Prefecture Have Enrolled

    [This Newspaper Dispatches] In order to raise the scientific level of farmers and absorb excellent farming experiences, Beijing Agricultural University has established a model worker study class this semester. The first group of recruits includes Ge Hetang, Wang Gengyin, Niu Renshun, Han Qiming, Meng Fadui, Wang Yanyan, and other labor heroes and farmers with rich farming experience from Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi. The enrolled model workers will work with the university's experts and professors to study and summarize farming experiences, and also serve as instructors for the students' farming techniques in order to combine agricultural education reform with production improvement. The study period is tentatively set for six months to one year. After the completion of the program, the model workers will return to their local areas to serve as a bridge for farmers to learn science and technology and improve production.
