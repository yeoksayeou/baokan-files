　　Japan's Trade Deficit Last Year Exceeded 300 Million US Dollars; Economy Increasingly Subordinate to American Monopoly Capital
    Yoshida Government Admits Expanding Exports is Difficult
    [Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] The "Second White Paper on Commerce and Industry," released by the Japanese Yoshida government's Ministry of Commerce and Industry (previously mistranslated as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry) on May 29th, exposed the increasing subordination of the Japanese economy to American monopoly capital. According to Reuters and Kyodo News Agency Tokyo dispatches: The "White Paper" revealed that although Japan's exports reached 510 million US dollars last year, nearly double the previous year, they were only about 30 percent of pre-war levels. On the other hand, last year's imports exceeded exports by 370 million US dollars, bringing Japan's total trade deficit since the end of the war to 1.35 billion US dollars. The "White Paper" had to admit that Japan's economy still relied on American "aid" for support. This dependence was created by the implementation of the "Dodge Plan," formulated by Detroit banker Dodge based on the so-called "Nine-Point Plan for Stabilizing the Japanese Economy." This plan greatly weakened the purchasing power of the domestic market, "causing a buildup of unsold goods," thus creating an urgent need to expand exports. However, according to the book: "Economic competition among capitalist countries is becoming increasingly fierce, and world trade in general is stagnating, which places a heavy burden on Japan, which relies on increasing trade to become self-reliant."

　　日本去年入超三亿余美元  经济日益从属美垄断资本
    吉田政府承认扩大出口很困难
    【新华社三日讯】日本吉田政府通商产业省（前误译为国际贸易及工业省）于五月二十九日发表的“第二次通商产业白皮书”，暴露了日本经济日益从属于美国垄断资本。据路透社、共同社东京讯：该“白皮书”透露：去年一年，日本的出口虽达五亿一千万美元，比前年约增加一倍，但与战前比较，仅及百分之三十。另一方面，去年的入口超过出口三亿七千万美元，这使日本自战争结束以来的入超总额达十三亿五千万美元。“白皮书”不得不承认：日本的经济依然仰赖着美“援”来支撑。这种从属性的造成，乃是由于执行美国底特律银行家道奇根据所谓“稳定日本经济九点计划”而制订的“道奇方案”。该方案大大削弱了国内市场的购买力，“使货物滞销累增”，因此迫切需要扩大出口。但是，据该书透露：资本主义国家间的“经济竞争日益激烈，世界贸易一般均陷于停滞状态，对于依靠增加贸易以求自立的日本，加上了很重的压力”。
