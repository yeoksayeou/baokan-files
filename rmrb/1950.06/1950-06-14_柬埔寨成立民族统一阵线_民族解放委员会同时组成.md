　　Cambodian National United Front Established
    National Liberation Committee Formed Simultaneously
    [Xinhua News Agency, dated 13th] According to Vietnam News Agency’s report from North Vietnam on the 9th: The Cambodian National United Front was established on April 19th. At the same time, the Cambodian National Liberation Committee was also officially formed recently. Ton Duc Thang, Acting Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, recently issued a congratulatory telegram, encouraging the people of Vietnam and Cambodia to "unite closely to achieve our common goal of annihilating the enemy." Cambodia is located west of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, with an area of approximately 67,000 square miles and a population of approximately three million. According to the "Agreement" approved by the French Parliament on January 29 this year, France allows Bao Dai's Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and other "three countries" to obtain so-called "autonomy" within the French Federation. But in reality, Cambodia, Laos, and Bao Dai's Vietnam, like before, are still French colonies.

　　柬埔寨成立民族统一阵线
    民族解放委员会同时组成
    【新华社十三日讯】据越南通讯社北越九日讯：柬埔寨民族统一阵线已于四月十九日成立；同时，柬埔寨民族解放委员会亦于最近正式组成。越南国民议会常务委员会代理主席孙德胜特于最近发表贺电，并勉越南和柬埔寨两民族的人民“紧密地团结起来，以达到我们歼灭敌人的共同目标”。按柬埔寨位于越南民主共和国的西面，面积约六万七千方英里，人口约三百万。根据法国议会于今年一月二十九日批准的“协定”，法国准许保大的越南和柬埔寨、老挝等“三国”，在法兰西联邦内取得所谓“自主”。但实际上，柬埔寨、老挝和保大的越南一样，仍然是法国的殖民地。
