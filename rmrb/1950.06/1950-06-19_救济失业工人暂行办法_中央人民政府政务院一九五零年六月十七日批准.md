Approved by the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government on June 17, 1950

Chapter I General Provisions

Article 3: The scope of relief is, in principle, temporarily limited to workers and staff formerly employed in state-owned and private industrial and commercial enterprises and dock transport businesses, as well as personnel engaged in cultural, artistic, and educational undertakings, who became unemployed after liberation and currently have no work or other income. Unemployed workers and staff who lost their jobs before liberation may be eligible for relief upon approval by local unemployed workers' relief committees if they have special difficulties.

Chapter II Organizations for Implementing Relief Work

Article 4: Any city organizing relief for unemployed workers should establish an Unemployed Workers' Relief Committee under the municipal people's government to plan and guide all relief matters. It shall be composed of representatives designated by the municipal government from the labor bureau, construction bureau or public works bureau, civil affairs bureau, public security bureau, trade union federation, federation of industry and commerce, and other relevant organs and organizations. The chairman shall be concurrently held by the mayor or deputy mayor, and one or two vice-chairmen shall be appointed by the municipal people's government.

Each office shall have a director, and each section shall have a section chief, all appointed by the Unemployed Workers' Relief Committee. In addition to personnel transferred from relevant organs, unemployed staff and workers should be given priority for employment.

Chapter III Relief Fund

Article 6: The sources of relief funds are as follows:

	(1) In all cities organizing relief for unemployed workers, the administrative side or the capitalists of all state-owned and private factories, workshops, and shops must contribute 1% of the total actual wages paid each month.

Chapter IV Registration of Unemployed Workers

Article 10: All unemployed workers and staff who meet the provisions of Article 3 of these measures may apply for registration. However, those who have already returned to the countryside for production or have found other jobs will not be registered.

Article 11: The registration of unemployed workers shall be handled by the grassroots organizations of the industrial trade unions affiliated with the municipal trade union federation, as entrusted by the Unemployed Workers' Relief Committee.

Article 12: When applying for registration, unemployed staff and workers must submit the following documents:

	(1) A certificate issued by the applicant's original trade union organization or the factory, shop, or school where they originally worked. If the original enterprise has been closed for a long time and it is impossible to obtain a certificate from the trade union organization or the capitalist, a certificate from two employed workers is required;
	(2) A certificate issued by the district government or police station in the applicant's current place of residence, proving that they are indeed an unemployed worker residing in that area.

The organs and personnel issuing certificates to unemployed workers shall be legally responsible for the events certified. Any discrepancies from the facts shall be subject to legal sanctions.

Article 13: Unemployed workers who have worked in several enterprises may only register in one place.

Article 14: Unemployed workers applying for registration must fill out an unemployed worker registration form.

Chapter V Work-for-Relief

Article 17: The scope of work-for-relief projects shall primarily include projects undertaken for national needs and projects beneficial to municipal construction, such as dredging rivers, repairing dikes, planting trees, repairing docks and sewers, and building roads and parks.

Article 18: The work-for-relief section of the local Unemployed Workers' Relief Office shall, in coordination with the construction bureau or public works bureau of the municipal people's government, formulate various work-for-relief project plans based on the specific situation, and submit a budget for the required labor and expenses.

Article 19: The funds required for work-for-relief projects shall be paid from the unemployed workers' relief fund allocated by the Central People's Government or local people's governments.

If it exceeds 20%, it shall be paid from the municipal construction fund.

Article 20: The workers required for work-for-relief projects shall be mobilized by the registration section of the Unemployed Workers' Relief Office in coordination with the municipal trade union federation from among the registered unemployed workers.
