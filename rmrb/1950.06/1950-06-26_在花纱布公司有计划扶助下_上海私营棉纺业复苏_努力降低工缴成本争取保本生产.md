With the Planned Assistance of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company
    Shanghai's Private Cotton Textile Industry Recovers
    Striving to Reduce Processing Costs and Achieve Break-Even Production
    [Shanghai News] Shanghai's private cotton textile industry has begun to see a turnaround. Of the cotton spinning mills, with the exception of fifteen that have ceased operations and one that has relocated inland, 73% of the 37 operating yarn mills in May have received planned and principled assistance from the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. In May, a total of 10,034 bales of cotton yarn were processed, which is the sum of March and April, accounting for more than 50% of the total output of these factories in the same month. According to the expanded processing plan for June, 90% of the aforementioned 37 yarn mills will be able to obtain cotton allocation for spinning, meaning that 77.23% of the existing spindles will be turning for commissioned spinning.

    According to statistics for the first week of June, the number of spindles in operation has reached 71.85% of the spindles capable of operating. Yarn production increased to 6,591.09 bales, setting a new record for weekly output since "February 6th," equivalent to 85% of the weekly yarn production before "February 6th." As a result, some factories have been able to gradually repay the outstanding commissioned spinning and weaving yarn and cloth owed before and after liberation. According to statistics from the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, in May, 2,050 bolts of cotton cloth and 818 bales of cotton yarn were recovered from old debts owed by factories in East China and Shanghai before liberation, and 1,890 bolts of cotton cloth and 1,768 bales of cotton yarn were recovered from debts owed after liberation. Thanks to the expansion of commissioned spinning and the planned procurement and allocation of raw cotton, the difficulties faced by private yarn mills in terms of raw cotton supply, product sales, and capital turnover have been largely resolved. The current issue is how each factory can strive for break-even production on this basis.

    Trade Unions Focus on Production - Spindle Draught Sets New Record
    In the process of striving for break-even production, the efforts of the workers have played a significant role. The trade unions in most factories have focused on production. Some have mobilized the masses to organize production and frugality committees, others have democratically formulated workshop labor agreements, and some have even launched production emulation campaigns. As a result, production efficiency has gradually improved. According to statistics for the first week of June, the average spindle draught (output per spindle in 20 hours) of the 37 operating yarn mills has reached 0.816 pounds, not only exceeding the 0.779 pounds before liberation but also setting a new record since liberation. The highest, Zhaofeng Yarn Mill, has reached over 1.1 pounds. Rongfeng No. 1 Mill, which originally had a lower spindle draught, has also increased from 0.66 pounds to over 0.762 pounds. At the same time, the amount of cotton and electricity used per bale of yarn has generally decreased. Wage and food reductions for workers have become a common phenomenon. Therefore, production costs in various factories have generally decreased. Taking Dafeng Yarn Mill, which has achieved break-even commissioned spinning, as an example: cotton consumption per bale of 20-count yarn decreased from 414.28 jin in April to 410.88 jin in May; during the same period, electricity consumption per bale of yarn decreased from 215 kWh to 200 kWh; worker wages per bale of yarn decreased from 106.74 real units to 90.36 units; and worker meal subsidies per bale of yarn decreased from 12.56 units to 8.98 units. The processing cost of Grade B yarn at this factory has now decreased from 275 units per bale to 219 units, meeting the commissioned spinning processing standard of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. In other factories, such as Qingfeng, cotton consumption per bale of yarn has decreased by 12 jin, and electricity consumption has decreased by 40 kWh; in Shenxin No. 2 Mill, cotton consumption per bale of yarn has also decreased from 417 jin to 411 jin, and electricity consumption has decreased from 250 kWh to 220.61 kWh. The processing costs of Rende, Hongfeng, Guoxin, and Rongfeng mills are now close to the commissioned spinning processing standards of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company.

    At the same time, some enterprises themselves have also begun to transform, some streamlining their organizations, some adjusting internally, and moving towards production rationalization and business enterprise. For example, the general production situation has improved significantly in Shenxin Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9, six factories, the private Zhongfang Yarn Mill, and the Dazhong Yarn Mill after rectification and operation. Furthermore, the cotton spinning section of Defeng Yarn Mill has two independent departments, the Yangzi (machine name) Department and the British Spinning Department. The former has only 3,000 spindles, and it is wasteful to be a separate unit. Recently, it is planned to merge it into the British Spinning Department, which can save more than 100 people. At the same time, the dyeing and finishing department of the factory currently has no work and also needs to be streamlined. These plans have been supported in principle by the workers. Labor and management are now negotiating a plan for break-even production.

    Management Policies and Methods Still Need to Be Improved
    Currently, the general difficulty in striving for break-even production in various factories is the issue of handling surplus labor. Comparing the existing number of spindles in operation with the number of workers in each factory, few meet the staffing standards determined by the first East China Textile Conference. Therefore, worker wages account for a significant proportion of processing costs. Taking the private Qixin Yarn Mill, which has an inflated workforce, as an example, in April, the processing cost per bale of 20-count yarn (excluding depreciation) reached 340 units, the highest processing cost among yarn mills in the city, with worker wages accounting for more than half of the processing cost. In contrast, at Dafeng Yarn Mill, which is close to the staffing standard, wages accounted for 43% of the processing cost in the same month. The second is the issue of the management policies of the business operators, such as unstable management and high debts, which increase the expenditure of financial expenses. Taking Qixin Yarn Mill as an example again, in April, the financial expenses per bale of yarn accounted for 7% of the processing cost, while at Dafeng Yarn Mill, it only accounted for 1.6%. Therefore, in order to achieve break-even production, in addition to the workers' efforts in production and frugality, business operators must find ways to reduce debt and reduce the expenditure of financial expenses.

    In addition, the quality of the cotton yarn commissioned by various factories is still far from the standard quality. According to the recent inspection by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, only five yarn mills, such as Zhaofeng, produce yarn that meets the Grade A standard, and most manufacturers have defects in their products.

    Individual Breaches of Contract Should Be Corrected Quickly
    Some manufacturers have even violated the commissioned spinning contract, such as Shenxin Nos. 2 and 5 mills delaying delivery (the person in charge of the factory has made a written self-criticism). Shenxin No. 7 Mill signed a contract on March 23 to commission the spinning of 409.5 bales, which should have been delivered by April 11. However, after accepting the commissioned spinning, from March 18 to April 19, the factory sold a total of 420 bales of 20-count yarn, and on April 22, it pledged 50 bales of 20-count yarn to the People's Bank. When the commissioned spinning contract expired, only 129 bales were delivered. Shenxin No. 6 Mill commissioned the spinning of 559 bales of 20-count Double Happiness yarn on March 23, which should have been delivered by April 11, but only 60 bales of cotton yarn were actually received by the deadline. During the commissioned spinning period, the factory sold 287 bales of 20-count yarn and 29 bales of 10-count yarn. These breaches of contract must be resolutely corrected.

　　在花纱布公司有计划扶助下
    上海私营棉纺业复苏
    努力降低工缴成本争取保本生产
    【上海讯】沪市私营棉纺业已开始有了转机，棉纺纱厂除十五家停工、一家内迁外，五月份三十七家开工纱厂已有百分之七十三获得花纱布公司的有计划、有原则的扶助。五月份加工棉纱计一○、○三四件，为三、四两月份的总和，占同月份各厂生产总量百分之五十以上。根据六月份的扩大加工计划，在上述三十七家纱厂中，百分之九十的厂家将可获得配棉代纺，亦即占现有开工锭数百分之七七·二三的纱锭，将为代纺而转动。
    据六月份第一周统计，开工纱锭已占可能开工纱锭的百分之七一·八五。产纱量增达六、五九一·○九件，创“二·六”后各周产量的最高纪录，相当于“二·六”前一周产纱量的百分之八五。因此，若干厂家已能将解放前后欠缴的代纺代织纱布逐步偿清。据花纱布公司统计，五月份收回解放前华东及上海各厂旧欠棉布二、○五○匹、棉纱八一八件，及解放后欠缴的棉布一、八九○匹、棉纱一、七六八件。由于扩大代纺及有计划地采购与分配原棉的结果，私营纱厂对原棉供应、产品销路及资金周转等困难，基本上已获得解决。目前的问题，是各厂如何在这个基础上，努力争取保本生产。
    工会面向生产  锭扯创新纪录
    在争取保本生产过程中，职工们的努力起了很大的作用。大部分厂的工会均已面向生产，有的发动群众组织生产节约委员会，有的民主订立车间劳动公约，有的且已展开生产竞赛运动。因而生产效率已逐步提高。据六月第一周的统计，三十七家开工纱厂平均锭扯（每枚纱锭二十小时产量）已达○·八一六磅，不仅超过解放前夕○·七七九磅的出数，且创解放后的新纪录。最高的兆丰纱厂已达一·一磅以上。原来锭扯较低的荣丰一厂也已从○·六六磅提高到了○·七六二磅以上。而每件纱的用棉量与用电量则普遍降低。职工的减薪、减膳更成为普遍现象。因此，各厂生产成本一般都在减低。如以达到保本代纺的大丰纱厂为例：每件二十支纱用棉量由四月份的四一四·二八斤减至五月份的四一○·八八斤；同时期，每件纱用电量由二一五度减至二百度；每件纱职工薪资由一○六·七四折实单位减至九○·三六单位，每件纱贴职工膳食由一二·五六单位减至八·九八单位。该厂乙级纱的工缴成本，现已由每件二七五个单位降至二一九个单位，达到了花纱布公司的代纺工缴标准。其他工厂如庆丰每件纱用棉量已减少十二市斤，用电量已减少四十度；申新二厂每件纱用棉量亦已由四一七斤减低到四一一斤，用电量则已由二五○度减少到二二○·六一度。仁德、鸿丰、国信、荣丰等厂的工缴成本，现均已接近了花纱布公司的代纺工缴标准。
    同时，有些企业本身亦开始改造，有的精简机构，有的调整内部，走向生产合理化、经营企业化的道路。如申新一、二、五、六、七、九，六个厂、私营中纺纱厂、大中纱厂等，在整顿经营后，一般生产情况均有显著改进。再如德丰纱厂棉纺部分为扬子（机器名字）部和英纺部两个独立部门，前者只有三千锭子，自成一个单位是很浪费的，最近计划把它合并到英纺部，这样可省去一百多人。同时该厂染整部目前没有工作也需要精简。这些计划原则上已得到职工们的支持。现劳资双方正协商保本生产的计划。
    经营方针方法还须继续改善
    现各厂争取保本生产中，一般的困难是剩余劳动力的处理问题，如按照各厂现有的开工锭数和职工人数比较，很少合乎华东首届纺织会议所决定的定员标准。因此，职工薪资在工缴成本中占相当大的比例。以人事臃肿的私营启新纱厂为例，四月份廿支纱每件工缴成本（折旧在外）达三百四十单位，为本市纱厂中工缴成本最高的一个，其中职工薪资占工缴成本一半以上。而接近定员标准的大丰纱厂，同月份薪资占工缴成本百分之四三。其次是企业经营者的经营方针问题，如经营不稳健、负债多，因而增加了财务费用的支出。再以启新纱厂为例，四月份每件纱财务费用竟占工缴成本的百分之七，而大丰纱厂仅占百分之一·六。所以要达到保本生产，除职工们的努力生产节约外，尤须企业经营者设法减轻负债，减低财务费用的支出。
    此外，各厂代纺棉纱的品质，与标准品质相去尚远，根据最近花纱布公司的检验，品质能合乎甲级纱的仅有兆丰等五家纱厂，多数厂家出品都有缺点。
    个别违约行为应即迅速纠正
    有的厂家甚至违反了代纺合同，如申新二、五两厂延期交货（该厂负责人已作书面检讨）。申新七厂于三月二十三日订约，代纺四○九·五件，应于四月十一日交清。但该厂承接代纺后，由三月十八日到四月十九日，共卖出二十支纱四百二十件，四月二十二日向人民银行押去廿支纱五十件。而代纺合约到期仅交出一百二十九件。申新六厂于三月二十三日代纺廿支双喜纱五五九件，应于四月十一日交清，但到期仅实收棉纱六十件，该厂在代纺时期中，曾卖出二十支纱二百八十七件，十支纱二十九件。这些违反合约的行为必须予以坚决纠正。
