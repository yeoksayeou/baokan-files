Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd -- State-owned trading companies in Northeast China are actively supporting the restoration and development of legitimate private industry and commerce. From January to May, the Northeast China branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company commissioned private weaving factories to process 229,000 bolts of finished products and private dyeing businesses to dye 310,000 bolts of various colored cloths, paying over 250 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) in dyeing and weaving processing fees. Since the beginning of this year, the Shenyang Department Store has organized processing orders for private factories, accounting for 43% of all knitting machines and 80% of all looms in the city's private enterprises. In April and May, the quantity of processed textile and knitted products increased approximately fivefold compared to the first quarter. In Harbin, the looms processed for the Songjiang Provincial Department Store account for 60% of the total number of looms in all private enterprises in the city.

The production of private factories that accept orders from and process for state-owned enterprises has expanded compared to before, as the supply of raw materials and sales channels have been resolved. The Huijuyong Weaving Factory in Shenyang was on the verge of ceasing production before establishing a processing relationship with state-owned enterprises. In the past two months, it has expanded to having over 20 power looms due to weaving over 3,000 bolts of finished products. In Harbin, the number of processing motor-driven weaving factories has increased from 40 to 650 looms; the number of dyeing factories has also increased from four to eight. Many private factories in the city have also accepted suggestions from state-owned trading companies to improve management and reduce costs. For example, the Wanchang and Gonghecai dyeing factories have reduced their product loss rate from 10% to 1%. Private enterprises can obtain legitimate profits through processing orders.

The consignment sales of finished products between public and private enterprises have also helped the development of private enterprises. The Northeast China branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company has entrusted 258 private enterprises to sell coal on consignment, with consignment sales reaching 280,000 tons in the first quarter of this year. Timber consigned for sale by private enterprises accounted for 40% of the total sales of the Northeast State-Owned Coal Industry Company in April. The Northeast Hardware and Electrical Materials Company entrusts private enterprises to sell calcium carbide, paraffin wax, fertilizer, etc. Private enterprises obtain appropriate profits from consignment sales. State-owned enterprises also help private enterprises sell products on consignment to solve their sales difficulties. The industrial service department of the Harbin Department Store sells products on consignment for over 1,000 private enterprises. In April, the Shenyang Department Store sold over 1,300 kinds of products on consignment for private enterprises, accounting for 34.6% of the total number of goods sold in the store.

　　东北国营企业扶助私营企业
    接受加工订货的工厂生产较前扩大
    不少厂家接受建议改善经营成本降低
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】东北各国营贸易专业公司积极扶助私营正当工商业的恢复与发展。中国花纱布公司东北区公司自一月至五月内，委托私营织布厂加工的成品达二十二万九千匹，委托私营染色业染的各种色布达三十一万匹，支付染、织的加工费即有二千五百余亿元（东北币，下同）。沈阳市百货公司自今年以来，组织加工订货的私营工厂，占全市私营企业所有针织机的百分之四十三和织布机的百分之八十。四、五两月，其加工纺织和针织的产品数量，较第一季度增加了五倍左右。哈尔滨市为松江省百货公司加工的织布机占该市所有私营企业织布机总数的百分之六十。
    接受国营企业订货的和为国营企业加工的私营工厂的生产，由于原料和产品销路得到解决，都较前扩大。沈阳惠聚永织布厂在未与国营企业建立加工关系前，生产陷于停顿状态。两月来由于加织成品三千余匹，已发展到拥有二十余台电力机。哈尔滨四十家加工的电机织布厂，织布机已由四百台增加到六百五十台；染厂亦由四家增至八家。该市不少私营工厂并接受国营贸易公司建议，改善经营，降低成本。如万昌、公和彩两染厂，已将产品损失率由百分之十减到百分之一。私营企业通过加工订货，均能获得正当的利润。
    公私企业彼此间代销成品，也帮助了私营企业的发展。中国煤业建筑器材公司东北区公司委托私营企业代销煤炭的已有二百五十八家，今年第一季度代销量达二十八万吨，委托私营企业代销的木材，四月份占东北国营煤业公司销售总额的百分之四十。东北五金电料公司则委托私营企业代销电石、石腊、肥田粉等。私营企业在代销中都取得适当的利润。国营企业也帮助私营企业代销产品，解决其销路的困难。哈尔滨市百货公司工业服务部为一千余家私营企业代销产品，沈阳市百货商店四月份代销私营企业产品一千三百余种，占该店经营商品总数的百分之三十四点六。
