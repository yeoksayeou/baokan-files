To Strengthen Work Planning and Improve the Custody System:
Beijing's Specialized Companies Inventory Assets
Discovering Unaccounted Items and Unclear Accounting in Some Units' Warehouses

[Reported by this newspaper] Since late April, thirteen specialized companies in Beijing, including those dealing in grain and general merchandise, have been inventorying all their assets. As of the end of May, nine specialized companies dealing in native produce, bristles, eggs, hides and furs, petroleum, oils and fats, cotton yarn and cloth, salt, and trust have completed their inventories. The four companies dealing in grain, retail, general merchandise, and coal construction will conclude their work by the end of this month. This inventory work will not only enable the government to further grasp the asset situation of state-owned trading departments, which is conducive to asset turnover, but also lay a favorable foundation for the specialized companies to strengthen work planning and improve various custody systems in the future.

Through this inventory, in terms of goods, it was found that some specialized companies' warehouses contained items that were not recorded in the books and items that were not needed by the units themselves. The grain company's warehouse had 69 pairs of Yuanbao cart wheels (for light railway small iron vehicles), 104 iron plates, about 300 jin of iron waist pieces, and 700 railway sleepers that were not on the books; items not needed for the unit's business included 720 bolts of fine white cloth and 3 pieces of imitation paper. The cotton yarn and cloth company cleared out 884 unaccounted-for Japanese-style rubber hats. There were discrepancies between the number of goods in stock and the number recorded in the books in some companies. In terms of accounting and cashiering, there were generally more problems. When the city's clearing team randomly checked the cash of various companies, they found many instances of overages and shortages. The hides and furs company had two shortages totaling 2.3 million yuan. The general merchandise company had a shortage of over 90,000 yuan. The first business office of the retail company had an overage of over 40,000 yuan. The third grain depot of the grain company had an overage of over 700,000 yuan. The main reason for this situation was unclear accounting and unsound cash management systems. For example, the first business office of the retail company did not have daily cash balances, only monthly balances. The office accumulated a large number of receipts, many of which were not recorded in time, and the recorded and unrecorded receipts were mixed together in great disorder. When the city's clearing team inquired about its cash on hand, they were at a loss for an answer. The phenomenon of using informal receipts or IOUs to offset cash (although the amounts were not large) was common in other companies. The loan system of various companies, except for the petroleum company, was relatively lax. Many of the oil and fats company's cadres' salary loan slips were not approved by the person in charge, and some even borrowed money without any IOUs. The egg products company had many small loans. The grain company had 179 loans, equivalent to more than 20,000 jin of millet. In addition, the coal construction company had 670 million yuan of futures payments that should have been received, but they have not been actively pursued.

Before the start of this clearing work, the city's commercial bureau convened meetings of the managers of various specialized companies three times to convey the Ministry of Trade's order on clearing the property of state-owned trade departments, study clearing methods, and form a city clearing team led by Zhang Jincheng, deputy director of the commercial bureau, as director, and the managers of the grain, general merchandise, and retail companies as deputy directors. Nineteen capable cadres were transferred from various units to take charge of daily secretarial, auditing, and inspection work. Each company also formed an inventory team, led by the manager of the company.

When this work was first deployed, some personnel in the companies had insufficient understanding of the inventory work, thinking that it was a "new setup" and that "there was nothing there." For this reason, the leadership uniformly arranged for the study of relevant documents and sent personnel to the companies at any time to check on the study situation. The staff gradually gained a clear understanding.

The methods adopted by the companies in the inventory work were of three kinds. (1) The sequence and time limit for inventorying cash, fixed assets, and commodities were determined, and the work was carried out in a "one-whip" style. The advantage of this method is that it saves manpower and is easy to control. The disadvantage is that it can easily take a long time. This method is suitable for units with simple materials. The eight companies that adopted this method were salt, coal construction, petroleum, hides and furs, bristles, native produce, egg products, and trust. (2) The retail company adopted a method of unified deployment and simultaneous action. This method is suitable for the specific situation of the company. However, because there were fewer cadres responsible for supervision and guidance, the inventory was not thorough enough. Now, the company has strengthened its efforts and is preparing for a review. (3) The four specialized companies of grain, general merchandise, oils and fats, and cotton yarn and cloth adopted the method of breaking through one point and leading the general. First, the inventory team was divided into three groups: cash, fixed assets, and commodities, which were inventoried simultaneously in one warehouse, depot, and department. After one place was cleared, another place was cleared. Experience was summarized at any time to improve working methods. This method is better when manpower is sufficient.

In the entire inventory process, the city clearing team adopted a method of division of labor and responsibility, timely checking whether there were any omissions or hidden problems in the inventory of each company, whether the storage methods were suitable, randomly checking the accounts and cash of each company for violations of regulations, waste, corruption, and so on, mastering the plan, and completing the task on schedule. In the inventory, the companies generally attached importance to this work. The grain company also formulated a custody system in conjunction with its business. However, some units still failed to better organize their forces, or the lack of planning affected the progress of the work.

At present, the city clearing team is stepping up the supervision and guidance of the inventory work of the retail and coal construction specialized companies, as well as the various review work of other companies, striving to complete all the work by the end of June.

### 为加强工作计划性健全保管制度打下基础  京各专业公司盘点资财  查出部分单位仓库存有不在账的物品和会计账目不清的现象

　　为加强工作计划性健全保管制度打下基础
    京各专业公司盘点资财
    查出部分单位仓库存有不在账的物品和会计账目不清的现象
    【本报讯】北京市粮食、百货等十三个专业公司自四月下旬开始盘点全部资财，截至五月底止，土产、猪鬃、蛋品、皮毛、石油、油脂、花纱布、盐业、信托等九个专业公司已盘点完毕；粮食、零售、百货、煤建等四个公司将于本月底结束工作。这次盘点工作，不但能使政府进一步掌握国营贸易部门的资财情况，有利资财周转。同时，为各专业公司今后加强工作计划性，与健全各种保管制度打下了有利基础。
    通过这次盘点，在货物方面，查出部分专业公司仓库中，存有未记账及存有非本单位所需物品。粮食公司仓库有不在账的元宝车轮（轻便铁道小铁车用的）六十九副，铁板一百零四块，铁腰子约三百斤，枕木七百根；非本单位业务需用的物品有白细布七百二十匹，模造纸三件。花纱布公司清出不在账的日式胶皮帽八百八十四顶。部分公司库存货物与账簿记载数目不符的现象。会计出纳方面，一般问题较多。市清理小组抽查各公司现金时，发现不少长、短款情形。皮毛公司短款两笔共计二百三十万元。百货公司短款九万余元。零售公司第一营业处长款四万余元。粮食公司第三粮栈长款七十余万元。造成这种情形的原因，主要是会计账目不清，现金出纳制度不健全。如零售公司第一营业处，现金没有日结数。仅在月末结存一次，该处积累大批单据多未及时登账，已登记与未登记的单据又混淆一起异常紊乱。当市清理小组询其库存现金时，茫然无从置答。其他公司以非正式单据或借条顶现款的（数字虽都不大），几成普遍现象。各公司的借支制度，除石油公司外，均较松弛。油脂公司干部借薪条据多未经负责人批准，甚至有没有借据而借去款项的。蛋品公司零星借款很多。粮食公司有一百七十九笔借支，折合小米两万余斤。此外，煤建公司应收到期货款达六亿七千余万元，至今仍未抓紧处理。
    这次清理工作开始之前，市商业局曾三次召集各专业公司经理开会，传达贸易部关于清理国营贸易部门财产的命令，研究清理办法，并组成市清理小组，领导各公司进行清理工作。小组系以商业局副局长张锦成为主任，粮食、百货、零售三公司经理为副主任，由各单位抽调得力干部十九人，分担日常秘书、审计、检查工作。各公司也分别组成盘点小组，由本公司经理任组长。
    这一工作开始布置时，各公司尚有部分人员对清点工作认识不足，认为“新建摊子”，“没有什么”。为此，领导方面统一布置学习有关文件，并随时派员到各公司检查学习情况。职工逐渐有了明确认识。
    各公司在盘点工作中，所采用的方法有三种。（一）把现金，固定资产，商品等订出盘点的先后次序及期限，互相衔接，“一条鞭”式的进行工作。这一方法的优点是：节省人力，便于掌握。缺点是：容易拖长时间。物资简单的单位适用此法。采用者有盐业、煤建、石油、皮毛、猪鬃、土产、蛋品、信托等八公司。（二）零售公司采取统一布置、一齐动手的方法。此法适宜于该公司的具体情况。但因负责督导干部较少，盘点不够彻底，现已加强力量，准备复查。（三）粮食、百货、油脂、花纱布四专业公司，采用了突破一点、带起一般的办法。首先将盘点小组分为现金、固定资产、商品三组，在一个库、栈、部同时盘点。清完一处再清一处。随时总结经验，改进工作方法。在人力充实的条件下，采用此法较好。
    市清理小组在整个盘点过程中，采用了分工负责的办法，及时检查各公司盘点时有无遗漏、埋伏，保管方法是否适合；抽查各公司账目、现金有无违反制度、浪费、贪污等情形，掌握计划，按期完成任务。各公司在盘点中，一般都重视这一工作。粮食公司并结合业务订出保管制度。但部分单位仍未能更好组织力量，或因计划性不够，影响了工作的进行。
    目前市清理小组正抓紧对零售、煤建专业公司盘点工作的督导，以及其他公司的各项复查工作，争取六月底完成全部工作。
