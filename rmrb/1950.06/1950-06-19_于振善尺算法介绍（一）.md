　　Introduction to Yu Zhendan's Ruler Algorithm (Part 1)
    Since our journal published the article "Yu Zhendan, Inventor of the Ruler Algorithm" on May 19th, many readers have written to inquire about the ruler algorithm. Our journal will present a more detailed introduction to the ruler algorithm starting today for everyone's study.
                                                 —Editor
    Discovering the Function of the Ruler through Practical Observation
    When Comrade Yu Zhendan began researching the new algorithm, he spent five years creating a "wooden calculator." Due to insufficient technology and material conditions, it was unsuitable for the needs. He felt it was necessary to change his research tools. So he began practical observations, studying various things, and came to the following conclusion: Whether it's trains, ships, houses, tables, chairs, or any utensils, when manufacturing begins, the dimensions are first measured with a ruler, then calculations and designs are made, and then a ruler is used to measure while making them. Therefore, he thought that a ruler could definitely be used to calculate accounts. He selected the "ruler" as his research tool.
    Discovering Addition and Subtraction Calculations with a Ruler from Labor Experience
    Yu Zhendan gained an experience while working as a carpenter: If you want to divide a piece of wood into two equal parts, you don't need to measure how wide the wood is first; you only need to use two rulers with the same scale, align the 0 of one ruler with one side of the wood, and align the 0 of the other ruler with the opposite side. Mark a point where the scales of the two facing rulers are the same, and draw a vertical line from that point to divide the wood into two equal parts.
    He carefully studied the relationship between these two rulers, and found that the 0 of the upper ruler (which he called the positive ruler) was directly opposite the 8 on the lower ruler (which he called the inverted ruler), the 1 of the positive ruler was directly opposite the 7 of the inverted ruler, the 2 of the positive ruler was directly opposite the 6 of the inverted ruler...; at the same time, the 7 of the positive ruler was directly opposite the 1 of the inverted ruler, the 8 of the positive ruler was directly opposite the 0 of the inverted ruler. From this, he came to the conclusion that the numbers represented by all the opposite scales of these two rulers add up to 8. Thus, he obtained the method of using a ruler to calculate addition and subtraction.
    Getting Inspiration from "Obliqueness" from Labor Experience
    After Yu Zhendan researched the method of using a ruler to calculate addition and subtraction, he thought: Since you can divide a piece of wood into two equal parts without using a ruler to measure, you must also be able to divide a piece of wood into any number of equal parts without measuring the dimensions first. After much thought and experimentation, the result was that the wood could only be divided into even numbers (e.g., two, four, six, ...) of equal parts, but not into odd numbers (e.g., three, five, ...) of equal parts. One day, he was chopping a wooden stick with an axe, and he felt that chopping horizontally was very laborious, but if he chopped it obliquely, it would be very easy to break the wooden stick. At the same time, he also thought of when he was harvesting crops with a sickle in the autumn, cutting horizontally was laborious, but cutting obliquely was labor-saving; and he saw that the planes, chisels, saws, ... used in carpentry were all oblique-edged. Therefore, he became very interested in the function of "obliqueness," and he thought that if a ruler was used to obliquely divide wood and calculate accounts, it would definitely be possible.
    "Planar Oblique Division Method," "Planar Division Oblique Method," and "Mutual Bisection"
    After Yu Zhendan discovered the function of "obliqueness," he immediately devoted himself to the research and experimentation of this new method. From this, he discovered the principles of "planar oblique division method," "planar division oblique method," and "mutual bisection."
    If you want to divide a piece of wood into five equal parts, you only need to use an equally divided wooden ruler, align the 0 of this wooden ruler with one side of the wood, and slant the five-inch mark to the opposite side of the wood, as shown in the second diagram. At the places passing through the one-inch, two-inch, three-inch, and four-inch marks of the ruler, mark each point, and draw four lines parallel to the edge through these four points, and you can easily cut the wood into five equal parts. Using the same method, the wood can be divided into any number of equal parts. This method is called "planar oblique division method."

　　于振善尺算法介绍（一）
    自从本刊五月十九日发表“尺算法发明者于振善”的文章以后，许多读者来信询问关于尺算法的问题。本刊特从今天起将尺算法作一次较详细的介绍，以供大家研究。
                                                 ——编者
    从实地观察中发现了尺子的作用
    于振善同志在开始研究新算法的时候，曾花了五年的时间，造成了一种“木质计算器”。因为技术及物质条件的不足，不适合需要。他感到有改换研究工具的必要。于是他开始实地观察，研究各种东西，得出如下的结论：无论火车、轮船、房屋、桌椅及一切用具，在开始制造时，都是先用尺子量一量，定出尺寸，然后进行计算、设计，再用尺子量着作。因此，他想到尺子一定可以用来计算账目。他便选定了“尺子”作为他研究的工具。
    由劳动经验中发现用尺子计算加减
    于振善在做木工时得到了一个经验：如果想把一块木板分成二等份，不必先去量一量木板有多宽，只需用两根有同样刻度的尺子，把一根尺子的０，对在木板的一边上，把另一根尺子的０对在相反的对边上，在两根相对着的尺子刻度相同的地方记上一点，由这一点做一根垂直线，就可以把这块木板分成相等的两块。
    他仔细研究这两根尺子的关系，发现上面尺子（他叫作正尺）的０，正对着下面尺子（他叫作倒尺）上的８，正尺的１正对着倒尺的７，正尺的２正对着倒尺的６……；同时正尺的７正对着倒尺的１，正尺的８正对着倒尺的０。由这里他得到一个结论，就是：这两根尺子所有相对着的刻度所代表的数目，加起来都等于８。于是他得到了用尺子算加减的方法。
    由劳动经验中得到了“斜”的启示
    于振善研究出了用尺子算加减的方法以后，他就想到：既然可以不用尺量就能把木板平分成两份，也一定可以把木板分成随便多少等份，而无须先量尺寸。经过多次的思考与试验，结果只能把木板分成双数（例如二、四、六、……）的等份，而不能分成单数（例如三、五……）的等份。有一天，他用斧子砍一根木棒，他感觉到横着砍非常费劲，要是斜着砍，很容易就把木棒砍断了。同时，他又联想到在秋天用镰刀割庄稼的时候，横着割费力，斜着割省力；又看到作木工时所用的刨子、凿子、锯，……全是斜刃的。因此，他对“斜”的作用发生了很大的兴趣，他就想到如果用尺子来斜分木板及算账也一定是可以的。
    “平面斜分法”“平面分斜法”及“互相平分”
    于振善发现了“斜”的作用以后，他即努力于这个新方法的研究与试验。他由这里发现了“平面斜分法”、“平面分斜法”及“互相等分”的道理。
    如果想把一块木板分成五等份，只要用一个等分的木尺，把这木尺的０对在木板的一边上，将五寸的刻度斜在木板的对边上，如第二图所示，在通过尺子的一寸、二寸、三寸、四寸的地方各点一个点，过这四点画四条与边平行的线，即可很容易的把这木板截成五等份。用同样方法可将木板分成任何等份，这种方法就叫作“平面斜分法”。
