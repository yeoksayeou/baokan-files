　　Harbin Automobile Factory Branch's Guarantee and Supervision of Production
    Harbin Public Transportation Party Committee
    The Harbin Automobile Factory Branch, because it combined Party building with production and paid attention to building the Party in important departments and among technicians, constantly absorbing technical and skilled workers into the Party, enabled the Party organization to master production technology, creating a foundation for guaranteeing and supervising production.

  Political and Ideological Leader
    In the work of each period, the branch has paid attention to making itself a political and ideological leader for the employees, constantly struggling against various erroneous ideas and guiding them to the correct direction, creating favorable conditions for the administrative department to complete its tasks.
    When the anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign began last August, some employees thought: "Our work is not bad, there is nothing to check." Some workers thought: "We don't manage money, there is no waste." These ideas hindered the development and deepening of the inspection work. At this time, the branch, within the Party and through the trade union, used the method of detailed accounting to mobilize Party members and the masses, putting forward some specific examples, such as: "Cars on the line often add Mazout oil carelessly, spilling a pile outside. Calculating a minimum waste of one jin per day, nine months would waste 14 million yuan." This made the masses realize that "small waste becomes big waste when accumulated," thus launching the anti-waste movement.
    After the anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign was launched, it was discovered that there were phenomena of only talking about others and not oneself, and attacking each other. For example, drivers complained that minor repairs were not thorough enough, resulting in more breakdowns, while minor repairers complained that drivers did not take care of their cars; when cars that had undergone major repairs broke down, they complained that the materials purchased by the material section were not good, without examining whether there was a problem with their own work. This made it difficult to distinguish right from wrong, and everyone was unhappy, and the problem could not be solved. In order to seriously expose shortcomings and overcome waste, the branch held a meeting of Party members, calling on Party members to first examine themselves and guide the masses to carry out correct criticism and self-criticism. After the meeting, under the influence of the Party members' lead, four cases of corruption and theft were exposed, nine cases of waste in administrative management, nine cases of waste in production processes and labor organization, and two cases of waste in raw material supply and business management. A total of 74,829,000 yuan was wasted in nine months.
    The result of the anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign exposed that the serious problem in administrative management was the unsound system and the lack of necessary system establishment. Therefore, the Party groups put forward opinions on establishing a system. After discussion, the branch committee comprehensively submitted them to the administrative side, establishing and implementing the garage management system, the inspection and repair system, and abolishing the large and small repair warehouse system.
    When quota management was implemented this April, many workers thought: "Quotas are superfluous, it's enough to work hard." The more backward workers thought that the marking should be slower during standardization, fearing that the quota would be too high and they would not be able to bear it. Some even joked with the standardization personnel. Although they understood the quota, they insisted that they didn't understand, and said to the standardization personnel: "How can this be done? It will kill people." In response to this situation, the branch first discussed it within the Party, cleared the Party members' minds, and decided that Party members should first find the standardization personnel to standardize themselves. They also discussed with the administrative department, held a meeting to criticize the idea of resisting quotas and mischievous workers. They also explained to the workers in various ways: "If we can't come up with quotas, we can't give bonuses for exceeding the quotas, and at the same time, the public can't manage production well in a planned way." This paved the way for the formulation of technical standards and quotas.

    Overcoming the Administrative Leadership's Bureaucracy
    On the basis of the anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign, the factory launched a new record creation movement last October. However, as the movement unfolded, it exposed the phenomenon of the top not moving while the bottom moved, and the existence of some administrative management obstacles to the development of the movement. For example, electrician Xing Liyuan proposed to try to make an electric meter and buy a small pressure gauge. Section Chief Liu of the Motor Section repeatedly questioned him, asking Xing Liyuan for insurance, instead of adopting a research and help attitude. Secondly, the newly created record was delayed for a month without being rewarded. The administrative department didn't know who created the new record, and couldn't figure out who the inventor was. Administrative cadres were busy with meetings all day long and didn't go deep into the lower levels of work. In December, the management committee held seven meetings, the factory affairs meeting was held five times, and the standing committee was held every two or three days. One meeting lasted for a day at most and four hours at least. Many projects were discussed at the meeting, such as buying parts, wooden samples, and even the fact that haircuts were not good had to be discussed. This consumed most of the administrative cadres' time in meetings. The branch studied this situation and believed that the main problem was that the bureaucratic leadership method affected the work. Therefore, it suggested to the administrative department to reduce the time and frequency of meetings: the management committee should meet twice a month, and the factory affairs meeting should meet four times; and change the method of discussing everything, big and small, at the meeting. At the same time, it criticized individual Party member administrative cadres who did not support workers' new record creation within the Party.

    Struggling to Improve Quality
    After the launch of the new record movement, production efficiency generally improved, but product quality decreased with the improvement of production efficiency. Forty percent of the screws were not up to specifications; twenty-two of the machines that underwent major repairs broke down in a month, of which ten were due to poor repairs and twelve were due to poor raw materials; some of the newly repaired cars were pulled back after four or five days, while the machines that had undergone major repairs before the movement could run for an average of three to four months. Now, due to the creation of new records, one-sided attention has been paid to increasing output, and product quality has been generally ignored. Therefore, the branch, through the trade union, put forward the slogan "Improving quality is also creating new records," and explained that "Reducing quality will destroy the results of the new records." At the same time, it suggested to the administrative department to increase two inspectors who were detached from production and were specifically responsible for product quality inspection and guidance to improve quality. In addition, all Party members in the engineering department reviewed the reasons for the decline in quality and criticized the shortcomings of being too fast and causing products not to meet specifications. As a result, the situation of quality decline in major repairs changed, and quality was rapidly improved, from an average efficiency of 4,000 to 5,000 kilometers of operation to 15,000 kilometers. This April, it was raised again to 18,000 kilometers.

    Establishing Labor Discipline
    In the past, there was a lack of serious labor discipline in production, and the employees lived scattered and the work style was quite lax. There were often late arrivals and early departures from work. Some employees even went dancing at night and slept on their desks in the office after work. Some technicians even slipped away after work, so that the faulty cars pulled back from the line sometimes couldn't find technicians to repair them. In order to overcome this disorganized and undisciplined phenomenon, the branch began to study the issue of establishing and consolidating labor discipline. At the Party member meeting, it put forward the opinion of formulating service regulations and establishing a roll-call system for going to and from work. After discussion, everyone agreed, and then suggested this opinion to the administrative side. After discussion and supplementation by the workers' congress and the management committee, two plans were passed and implemented on a trial basis. The regulations are now being submitted to the company for approval.

    Listening to the Opinions of the Masses
    Because Party members took an active lead in production, the Party's prestige among the masses increased, and the relationship between the Party and the masses was also very close. The Party often listened to and collected the opinions and demands of the masses, and helped them to realize and solve them. For example, the masses proposed: it is not easy for the furnace core to crack when dipped in soybean oil, which is a good method; there are not enough small repair tools, which affects production, and tools need to be added. The branch promptly reflected these to the administrative side and solved them, and adopted and promoted these good methods. Therefore, the masses praised the Party for being truly resourceful.
    In a period last year, the food and accommodation of the employees were very bad: in terms of food, in the case of price fluctuations, they bought as they ate, resulting in more sharing and poor food. After research by the branch and the trade union committee, it was decided to temporarily borrow 1,000 points from the welfare fund as a food fund, which solved the difficulty of eating now and buying now, sharing more money and eating poorly. In terms of dormitory management, there was a lack of system, unsanitary, and things were often lost. The branch cooperated with the trade union to make suggestions to the administrative authorities, improve the system, the dormitory was painted with whitewash, and a daily inspector was set up to check hygiene. The lives of the workers have gradually improved.

　　哈市汽车厂支部对生产的保证与监督
    哈尔滨市公用交通党委
    哈市汽车厂支部因为在建党中结合生产，并注意了在重要部门与技工中建党，把技术与熟练工人不断的吸收到党内来，使党的组织掌握了生产技术，创造了对生产保证监督的基础。
  政治思想上的领导者
    在各个时期的工作中，支部都注意使自己成为员工政治思想上的领导者，经常的向各种错误思想做斗争，并引导到正确的方面，为行政上完成任务创造有利的条件。
    去年八月反贪污浪费开始时，一部分职工认为：“我们的工作不算坏，没有什么可检查的。”有的工人则认为：“我们不管钱，没有浪费。”这些思想阻碍着检查工作的展开和深入，这时支部在党内并经过工会以算细账的方法向党员群众进行启发动员，提出一些具体例子，如：“汽车在线路上，经常上麻斯油不小心，流到外边一堆。每日最低以浪费一斤计算，九个月就得浪费一千四百万元。”这样使群众认识到了：“小浪费多了就是大浪费”，从而展开了反浪费运动。
    反贪污浪费展开后，又发现只讲别人不讲自己，及互相攻击的现象。如司机嫌小修理不彻底，故障多，小修理则嫌司机不爱护车；大修理的车出了故障则嫌材料股买的材料不好，而不检讨自己工作是否有毛病。这样弄得是非不清，大家都不痛快，问题无法解决。支部为认真揭发缺点，克服浪费，召开了党员大会，号召党员首先检讨自己，引导群众开展正确的批评与自我批评。会后，在党员带头影响下，揭发出贪污偷盗四件，事务管理上的浪费九件，生产过程与劳动力组织方面的浪费九件，原材料供应与业务管理方面的浪费两件。九个月内总计有七千四百八十二万九千元的浪费。
    反贪污浪费的结果，暴露了行政管理上严重的问题是，制度不健全与缺乏必要制度的建立，因之党的各小组提出了关于建立制度的意见。支委讨论后综合向行政方面提出，建立并实行了车库保管制度、检修制度和废除大修理小仓库制度。
    今年四月搞定额管理时，很多工人认为：“定额是多余的，好好干活就算了。”较落后的工人认为在标定时要慢一点，怕额定高了吃不消，还有的开标定员的玩笑，本来明白定额的，硬说不懂的，给标定员说：“这怎么整，非把人累死不可。”针对这样情况，支部先在党内作了讨论，打通党员思想，决定由党员先找标定员给自己标定。又和行政方面商讨，开会批评了抵制定额的思想和调皮的工人。并向工人多方解释：“弄不出定额来，就不能给超额奖励，同时公家亦不能很好的有计划的管理生产。”这才为技标与定额的制定打通了路。
    克服行政领导的事务主义
    在反贪污浪费的基础上，去年十月工厂开展了创新纪录运动。但随着运动的展开，暴露出上面不动下面动，及行政管理上存在一些阻碍运动发展的现象。如电工邢立远提出要试做电表，买一个小压力做表计。电机股刘股长再三考问，要邢立远保险，而不采取研究与帮助的态度，其次对已创出的新纪录，拖拉一个月还不奖励。谁创了新纪录行政方面也不知道，弄不清谁是发明者。行政干部整天忙于开会，不深入下层工作。十二月份一个月管委会就开了七次会议、厂务会开了五次、常委会则三两天开一次。一个会多则一天少则四个小时。会上讨论的项目很多，如买零件，木样子，甚至剃头的不好等都要讨论，这样使行政干部的时间大部消耗在会议上。支部研究了这种情况，认为主要的问题是事务主义的领导方法影响了工作。因之向行政方面建议，减少会议时间与次数：管委会一月开两次，厂务会开四次；并改变在会上大小事什么都讨论的办法。同时在党内批评了个别不支持工人创新纪录的党员行政干部。
    为提高质量而斗争
    新纪录运动展开后，生产效率普遍提高，但产品质量却随着生产效率的提高而降低了，螺丝有百分之四十不合规格；大修理的机器一个月有二十二台坏的，其中有十台是因修理的不好，十二台是因原材料不好；刚修完的车有的出去四五天就拉回来，而运动前大修理完的机器平均都可跑三至四个月。现在却因创新纪录而片面的注意了提高产量，普遍忽视了产品质量，所以支部又经过工会在工人中提出：“提高质量亦是创新纪录”的口号，并说明“质量降低就破坏了新纪录的成果”。同时向行政方面建议增加，两个脱离生产的检查员，专门负责产品质量的检查，和指导提高质量。另外在工务科部门的全体党员中对降低质量的原因进行了检讨，批评了图快而致产品不合规格的缺点。因之大修理中质量降低的情况随之转变，并迅速提高了质量，由运行四五千公里的平均效率提高至一万五千公里，今年四月再次提高至一万八千公里。
    建立劳动纪律
    过去在生产中缺乏严肃的劳动纪律，员工们又住的分散，工作作风相当散漫。上下班常有迟到早退。更有的职员晚上去跳舞，上班后爬在办公室桌上睡觉。甚至有的技工上班后又溜走了，以致从线路上拉回来的故障车，有时竟找不上技工修理。为了克服这种无组织无纪律现象，支部着手研究了建立与巩固劳动纪律的问题。在党员会议上提出制订服务规程与建立上下班翻牌制的意见。经过讨论，大家意见一致后，即将此项意见建议到行政方面，经工人大会和管委会的讨论、补充，通过了两个方案，先行试行。该规程则正呈请公司批准中。
    倾听群众意见
    由于党员在生产的积极带头，党在群众中威信提高了，党群关系也很密切了。党经常倾听与收集群众的意见和要求，并帮助其实现与解决。如群众提出：作炉心子沾豆油不易裂，是好办法，小修理工具不够，影响生产，需要添制工具。支部都及时反映到行政方面解决了，又采用与推广了这些好办法。因之群众都称赞党是真有办法的。
    去年一个时期职工食宿情况很坏：伙食方面在物价波动的情况下，现吃现买，结果摊的多、吃的不好，支部和工委研究后，决定从福利基金中暂借一千分作为伙食基金，解决了现吃现买，多摊钱还吃不好的困难。在宿舍管理方面缺乏制度，不卫生，又经常丢东西。支部协同工会向行政上提出建议，健全了制度，寝室又刷了石灰水，并每天设了值日员检查卫生。使工人们的生活逐渐得到了改善。
