　　交通银行举行董事会
    南汉宸等当选常务董事
    总经理张平之报告业务
    【新华社五日讯】交通银行董事会已于三日在北京举行。出席公私股董事共二十人，已超过法定人数。国外少数因病或因事不能出席者，亦书面委托其他董事为代表。会议票选南汉宸等七人为常务董事，已呈报政务院就常董中指定董事长。此次董事会并通过要案甚多，其中有：（一）建议政府修订公布该行原条例。（二）追认上海解放后因总处负责人员离散，由政府临时任命的张平之为总经理，洒海秋为副总经理，并追认他们在本届董事会以前自一九四九年十一月一日起的一切行务措施，包括编制之变更、人员之任免、业务、会计事务，以及对国内外行处所发之指示。（三）追认该行总管理处迁京办公。（四）该行发给国外行处主持人及派往国外人员之授权书，决定仍照例由董事长或总经理签发。（五）通过总经理张平之关于复业后的业务及组织与人事变更报告。（六）决定了董事会及常务董事会的集会时期。
    该行总经理张平之在业务报告中指出，解放后该行国内行处依据人民政府的指示，在人民银行总行领导下，已把交通银行改造成为一个名符其实的实业专业银行。一年来该行通过存、放、汇等业务，扶植了有利于国计民生的工、矿、交通等事业的恢复与发展，工作中获得不少成绩，并创造了很多适合当时需要的新型贷款方式。关于海外行处工作，截至目前止，在八个海外行处中已有香港、加尔各答、仰光等三行在战胜国民党反动派各种阴谋破坏后，与总处恢复了正常关系。
    按交通银行为公私合营的专业银行，中央人民政府政务院曾于今年五月五日发布命令，承认除战争罪犯以外的原有商股董事和监事，并任命南汉宸、胡景澐、曹菊如、何长工、章伯钧、王绍鏊、杨卫玉、武竞天、钱之光、钱昌照、陈穆、张平之、李钟楚等十三人为公股董事，朱学范、陈郁、孙越崎、何松亭、王磊等五人为公股监事。自命令发布后，该行即积极筹备此次董事会的召开。
