    【Report from our newspaper in Taiyuan】The people's school in Liubao Village, Yuci County, Shanxi Province, has maintained its original teaching system during the intense spring plowing period of the past two months. In addition to literacy education, it has also explained knowledge on increasing production, organizing mutual aid teams, warm water seed soaking, and preventing wheat seedling yellowing and blight, which has generally improved farmers' enthusiasm for production. Residents living by the roadside at the entrance of the village reflected: "We are really thriving this year! From early morning till night, people are like attending a fair. This hasn't happened in years." Women have also begun to break traditional customs and participate in labor production. Some women bring their farming tools to the people's school and go to work in the fields after class.

    During this stage, the female students in the village's people's school have been particularly enthusiastic about learning. The reason is that more than twenty female cadres and activists in the village, who were originally illiterate, are working hard to learn and can lead other women to learn. The self-awareness of all young and middle-aged women in learning has been improved, overcoming the shortcomings of the winter school, such as "not coming unless called, not coming even when called, attending perfunctorily, and taking longer to gather people than to hold class." About ten women who had never attended winter school before have now become regular and good students at the people's school. Many women carry books and chalk with them after class, learning to write characters anytime, anywhere. The students' textbooks and notebooks have increased by half compared to winter school. A test was recently held, and in the past two months, the most learned one hundred and twenty to thirty characters, and the least could write more than ten characters.

    Conversely, the male students in the village are not enthusiastic about learning. On the one hand, this is because most male cadres, militiamen, and Youth League members, except for a few who actively study, do not study hard themselves and affect the mood of other students; on the other hand, there are also problems with the teaching in the people's school. The teaching of political lessons is not closely linked to reality, and the lessons are based on rote memorization of regulations, lacking lively materials, which makes everyone uninterested in listening. In literacy education, those with higher levels of education feel that they cannot meet their learning requirements and are not interested. The assistance to illiterate learners is also poor. Moreover, when literacy classes are held at night, a small lamp is placed in front of the blackboard, which can only be used by the teachers, and the students cannot see clearly, so they sleep in the back. Therefore, people with urgent learning needs, such as Zhang Wubao and Ji Tu only and seven or eight others, do not attend night school but study in their own homes when they have time. Some let their wives study and then teach them when they return. Others go to the primary school to learn from students or teachers.

    The village's Cultural and Educational Committee recently held a meeting to review the learning situation in this stage, conducted criticism and self-criticism, and decided to strengthen the mobilization and leadership of male students in literacy, while improving the teaching of political lessons. The members of the village's Cultural and Educational Committee and the village's main cadres formed a separate study group, and according to the production policy and the instructions of higher authorities at various times, as well as the Shanxi "Peasant Daily," they collectively studied and researched three times a month, linked to the actual work in the village and the thinking of the masses, jointly selected the teaching materials for the three political lessons each month (the content includes praising production models, exchanging production experiences, etc.), and designated someone to teach. Everyone was assigned to be responsible for guiding group discussions in the school and publicity work outside the school. The teaching of cultural courses has also been improved, and classes are now held during the day (political lessons are still held at night); students who have a rudimentary understanding of writing are mobilized to study the "Peasant Daily."

　　山西榆次六堡村民校  结合生产改进教学
    【本报太原讯】山西省榆次县六堡村的民校，两个月来在紧张的春耕中坚持了原定的教学制度，除进行识字教育之外，还讲解了增产、组织变工、温汤浸种、防止麦苗黄疸黑疸等知识，普遍提高了农民的生产情绪。住在村头路旁的群众反映：“俺们今年可红火哩！一早一晚上地的人就像是赶会一样。这是几年来没有的事情。”妇女们也开始打破了传统惯例，参加了劳动生产。有的妇女带着农具上民校，下了课就到地里干活去了。
    在这一阶段中，该村民校的妇女学员学习情绪特别高。原因是村里的妇女干部和妇女积极分子二十多个人原来都是文盲，自己努力学习并能带领别的妇女学习。全部青壮年妇女的学习自觉性提高了，克服了过去冬学里那种“不叫不来，叫也不来，来了应付，集合人比上课时间长”的缺点。有十来名从没有上过冬学的妇女，现在都成了经常上民校的好学员。许多妇女在课外都带着书和石灰块，随时随地学写字。学员们的课本和笔记本比冬学时增加了一半。最近举行了一次测验，两个月中最多的学了一百二三十个字，最少的也能写十几个字。
    相反的，该村的男学员们学习不起劲。这一方面是因为男干部、民兵、青年团员除个别积极学习外，大多数是自己不好好学，并影响别的学员的情绪；另一方面，民校的教学也有问题。政治课教学结合实际不够，死搬条文，缺乏活材料，大家听得不起劲。在识字教育上，文化程度较高的感到不能满足学习要求，没有兴趣。对文盲学习的帮助也差。而且在夜里上识字课时，黑板前放一盏小灯，只能供教员使用，学员们看不清楚，便在后边睡觉。因此，有迫切学习要求的人，如张五保、冀秃只等七八人，不上夜校而在自己家里抽空学习。有的人则让妇女去学，回来再教他。有的人则自己到小学校里去向学生或教员学习。
    该村文教委员会最近开会检查了这一阶段的学习情况、进行了批评与自我批评，决定加强对男学员识字的动员领导，同时改进政治课的教学。村文委会委员和村主要干部单独组成学习小组，根据生产政策与上级各个时期的指示以及山西《农民报》，联系村内实际工作和群众思想，每月集体学习研究三次，共同选定每月三次政治课的教材（内容包括表扬生产模范、交流生产经验等），指定专人上课。大家分工负责辅导校内小组讨论和校外的宣传工作。文化课教学也加以改进，改在白天上课（政治课仍在晚上）；对粗通文字的学员，则动员他们学习《农民报》。
