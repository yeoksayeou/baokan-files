Fellow Committee Members, Comrades:

Eight months have passed since the establishment of the Central People's Government. During this period, the Government Administration Council and the Financial and Economic Commission have done some work in the financial and economic fields. Several of these tasks concern the entire country and the vast people, namely: unifying the management and leadership of national financial and economic work, levying grain taxes and issuing public bonds to balance national revenue and expenditure, stabilizing currency and prices, taking over, establishing, and beginning to restore various state-owned industrial, commercial, and financial enterprises, investing in transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, and some industries, adjusting public-private relations and labor-management relations, transporting grain to supply large cities, and allocating grain and funds to relieve disaster victims and unemployed workers. Some of these tasks have achieved significant results, while others are only beginning to show results. The achievements of all tasks depend on the support, assistance, and hard work of the broad masses of people across the country, government personnel at all levels, and democratic figures from all walks of life. All tasks have shortcomings, and some have even made mistakes, mostly due to a lack of understanding of the situation and a lack of experience, which are being improved. The future task is to uphold and promote the victories and achievements already achieved, consolidate these victories and achievements, summarize experiences, analyze the situation, educate cadres, act prudently, and strive to gradually realize the various financial and economic tasks stipulated in the Common Program, to live up to the expectations of the people of the whole country and fight for a fundamental improvement in the overall financial and economic situation. Today, I want to report to the Second Session of the National Committee on three issues that concern everyone: the general situation on the current economic front, the adjustment of industry and commerce, and the adjustment of taxation, because these issues are of concern to everyone.

(1) On the General Situation on the Current Economic Front

The economic and financial situation of our country is currently at a major historical turning point. This is a historical turning point in transforming the semi-colonial and semi-feudal economy into an independent and free New Democratic economy throughout the country, a historical turning point from backwardness to progress, and a historical turning point from a bad situation to a good situation.

The long-term inflation and commercial speculation caused by the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries are backward and constitute a bad situation. Without changing this bad situation, we cannot stabilize the economic and market order and enable social production and commerce to move forward along the right track. This is a very important beginning for us to establish a New Democratic economic order and transform the national economy throughout the country. Now it can be said that we have begun to achieve victory in this matter. Of course, we must not be complacent in the slightest, because our great cause lies in the future, and our tasks on the economic front are many and significant. Many disasters left to the people by the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries still need to be eliminated step by step, the wounds of war still need to be healed, and the people still have many difficulties. Moreover, we still lack experience in this work, and we can only gradually accumulate experience in the work. However, it should be admitted that a batch of victories we have already achieved, namely, the unified financial and economic work, the approaching balance of financial revenue and expenditure, and the stabilization of currency and prices, are undoubtedly the right things to do and are a manifestation of the beginning of the improvement of our country's economic situation. The vast majority of the people have seen and begun to benefit from the stability of currency and prices. Many far-sighted and patriotic national capitalists have also begun to understand that this stability will be beneficial to their future business.

Many difficulties have arisen in the industrial and commercial circles at present, which are due to the following circumstances: First, the stability of currency and prices has exposed and stopped the false purchasing power in the past society. That is to say, during the inflation period of the past ten years or so, in order to avoid the loss of currency depreciation, people were unwilling to deposit currency and preferred to compete to purchase and hoard goods that were not for consumption. This situation has now changed. They not only no longer hoard goods, but also spit out the goods they hoarded in the past to the market. This has created a temporary situation in the market where the supply of some materials exceeds the demand, business is not good, and many industrialists and businessmen have difficulties. This situation is extremely temporary, and once the original hoarded goods are sold out, the relationship between supply and demand will move towards a normal state. Second, some industries and commerce that were suitable for development in the colonial and semi-colonial economy have lost their markets due to the elimination of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and many other goods do not meet the specifications of the people's needs. This situation has caused the closure of some industrial and commercial enterprises, resulting in the unemployment of some workers, who need relief and re-employment. Third, many private enterprises have bloated and large institutions, unreasonable business management methods, high costs, low profits, or even losses. This has also caused many industries and commerce to shrink their business or even stop work and close their shops. It must be readjusted before there is a way out. Fourth, the blindness in the economy, the blind competition within the same industry, and the lack of coordination between supply and demand between regions. This has also caused many reductions in production, shutdowns, and bankruptcies. As for the fact that the long-term war has greatly reduced the purchasing power of the people, making industry and commerce depressed, it is a phenomenon that everyone sees.

All of these are left to us by history. These problems are now prominent because the long-standing semi-colonial and semi-feudal economic situation has undergone fundamental changes. Although the change is painful, the nature of this change is not bad. It will lead to new life, reconstruction, prosperity, and the establishment of a sound New Democratic economy. This change is the result of the great people's revolution. The revolution overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and destroyed the economic order of this reactionary rule. As Chairman Mao said: "The entire socio-economic structure is reorganized to varying degrees," which is the change that is taking place now. This change is indeed a kind of pain and a kind of difficulty in the temporary sense, but it is a kind of pain and difficulty towards new life, reconstruction, and prosperity. On the whole, it is temporary. Chairman Mao analyzed the two situations of the old liberated areas and the new liberated areas, pointing out that the above-mentioned pain and difficulty are only phenomena in the new liberated areas; in the old liberated areas, the problem of this pain and difficulty has either been solved or is close to being solved. Chairman Mao cited three conditions for solving this pain and difficulty, namely (1) the completion of land reform; (2) the rational adjustment of existing industry and commerce; (3) a large reduction in the expenses required by state organs; and these conditions can be strived to be realized throughout the country in about three years. All pessimistic arguments on economic issues are groundless. This is our simple analysis of the general situation on China's current economic front.

(2) On Adjusting Industry and Commerce

There are many problems in the topic of adjusting industry and commerce. It includes the problem of adjusting the relationship between public-owned industry and commerce and private-owned industry and commerce, the problem of adjusting the relationship between public-owned and public-owned, the problem of adjusting the relationship between private-owned and private-owned, the problem of adjusting the relationship between industry and commerce, the problem of adjusting the relationship between the financial industry and industry and commerce, the problem of adjusting the relationship between urban and rural areas, the problem of adjusting the relationship between domestic regions, the problem of adjusting the internal relations of various enterprises, and the problem of adjusting import and export relations. Here, I will mainly talk about some policies and methods of the People's Government on the issue of adjusting public-private relations.

The People's Government protects national industry and commerce. Everyone has known this for a long time. The Common Program recognizes the existence and development of all private capitalist economies that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and do not manipulate the national economy and the people's livelihood. In industrially backward China, for a long time, national capitalists developing industry and investing in industry are progressive and beneficial to the country and the people. Although commercial capital in China is too inflated in large cities, at the same time, we understand that China is a large country with a scattered small production dominating. The existence of private merchants is unavoidable. In order to develop commodity exchange, the state allows private capital to operate commerce, which is also beneficial to the country and the people. The People's Government protects the interests of all capitalists who are conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood, but at the same time opposes the behavior of all people who are harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood and engage in speculation and sabotage. The state-owned economy is the leading force of all social economic components. The above are the basic starting points for our various tasks of adjusting public-private economic relations today.

Regarding the basic policy of the People's Government on public-private economic relations, Article 26 of the Common Program is written very clearly and appropriately, namely: "The state should adjust the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, the individual economy of farmers and handicraftsmen, the private capitalist economy, and the state capitalist economy in terms of business scope, raw material supply, sales market, labor conditions, technical equipment, financial policy, and monetary policy, so that various social economic components can cooperate under the leadership of the state-owned economy, each performing its own functions, so as to promote the development of the entire social economy." Thus, the so-called public-private relationship includes the relationship between five social economic components. Today, I am not prepared to explain in detail all the problems of all these relationships here, but only to explain some problems that must and can be solved now.

We believe that in order to achieve a certain coordination between public-private relations and alleviate the difficulties that occur at the current historical turning point in our country's economy, the People's Government should take the following measures.

In the industrial aspect:

1.  Whenever possible, the government and state-owned enterprises entrust private factories to process and order goods from private factories. The Financial and Economic Commission of the Government Administration Council will uniformly organize the orders for processing and ordering goods required by various state-owned enterprises, organs, and troops, hoping to distribute these orders to public and private factories twice a year and sign contracts so that public and private factories can organize production in a planned manner.
2.  The government purchases a portion of agricultural products and provides favorable conditions for industrial products that are still difficult to export but may be strived to export, thereby expanding the domestic and foreign markets for industrial products.
3.  Unite public and private forces to organize the turnover of industrial funds.
4.  Call on private enterprises to improve business management methods, improve labor-management relations, and jointly overcome difficulties in enterprises.
5.  In order to adjust the relationship between public and private enterprises, the government is prepared to unify and adjust the production undertakings scattered by various organs, troops, and groups other than state-owned enterprises in a step-by-step manner, so that they are coordinated with private enterprises, handicrafts, and farmers' sideline occupations without conflict.
6.  Announce to the whole country at any time which industrial sectors have temporarily been overproduced or have reached saturation, so that people know where to go and avoid the disadvantages of engaging blindly.
7.  Focus on unemployment relief and try to organize the unemployed to participate in national public works, such as building water conservancy projects and constructing municipal engineering projects.

In the commercial aspect:

1.  As stipulated in the Common Program: "State-owned trading agencies should be responsible for regulating supply and demand, stabilizing prices, and supporting the people's cooperative undertakings." Here, the government is required to stipulate an appropriate price policy at any time according to the economic situation, that is, to maintain an appropriate distance between wholesale prices and retail prices, and between regions. The limit of this distance is to enable retailers and distant merchants to have appropriate profits, so that commerce is smooth, which is convenient for the restoration and development of production.
2.  The number of retail stores and department stores set up by state-owned trading agencies is limited to stabilizing retail market prices and preventing speculative merchants from disrupting the market. Retail stores only sell six kinds of daily necessities for the people: grain, coal, yarn, cloth, edible oil, edible salt, and petroleum. The responsibility of state-owned wholesale companies lies in withdrawing currency and stabilizing wholesale prices.
3.  Whether agricultural products have sales and how fast they are sold is a major event related to people's livelihood. At present, the purchase scope of state-owned trading agencies can only be a part of the main agricultural products, export materials, and main agricultural by-products. The rest must be encouraged to be purchased by cooperatives and private merchants.
4.  It is necessary to maintain appropriate prices for agricultural products and protect the legitimate production interests of farmers, but it is also necessary to take care of sales and transportation profits, so that agricultural products can sell well, which is beneficial to farmers.
5.  In order to accelerate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and make farmers and urban people benefit from it, local people's governments should provide private merchants with full convenience in transportation procedures and transportation conditions, and give appropriate consideration in tax policies and tax procedures.

In the financial industry aspect:

What can be said in this regard at present is that state banks continue to sponsor joint loans from public and private banks and gradually expand their business on the existing basis.

In the aspect of industrial and commercial organizations:

In order to adjust public-private enterprise relations and negotiate related issues at any time, it is appropriate for public and private industry and commerce to form trade associations and federations of industry and commerce.

Some of the above-mentioned measures have begun to be implemented, and some are being prepared for implementation. Among them, the first measure in the industrial aspect, that is, the government and state-owned enterprises entrust private factories to process and order goods from private factories, is relatively important in the position it occupies today, whether for the entire national economy or for private industry. Regarding this measure, we believe that the following two methods should be followed:

First, when entrusting private factories to process or ordering goods from private factories, the cost calculation of processing fees or commodity prices should not be calculated according to the level of production technology of each factory, but should be calculated according to the average standard of general factories in the same region under reasonable operating conditions. This standard of processing fees or commodity prices also applies to public and private factories. For the processing or ordering of certain products, if the government and state-owned enterprises are not for their own needs, but only to maintain the production of private factories so as not to stop, in this case, in order to reduce the burden on the government and state-owned enterprises, the calculation of processing fees and commodity prices of private factories should be lower than the general normal processing fees and commodity prices. However, the prices and delivery conditions of all processing orders should be agreed upon by both parties, and whether the transaction is concluded or not is entirely voluntary.

Second, in order to appropriately distribute processing orders to various public and private factories, all processing orders from the government and various state-owned enterprises must be managed and distributed by the local people's government's industry and commerce bureau. The local federation of industry and commerce, the federation of trade unions, the trade association, and the industrial trade union must assist in carrying out the contract, guaranteeing the fulfillment of the contract, and clearing the payment for goods on time, in quantity, and in quality.

We believe that if the above-mentioned measures in all aspects can be implemented smoothly, it will be helpful for the national industry and commerce to overcome the current difficulties.

In addition, some people have proposed that the government formulate investment regulations or company laws. We believe that this is necessary and is currently being drafted.

Regarding the issue of adjusting public-private economic relations, this is what I want to say now.

(3) On Adjusting Taxation

Since the unification of national financial and economic work in March this year, the national finance has shown a new situation of near balance between revenue and expenditure. Due to the near balance of financial revenue and expenditure in the three months of March, April, and May, the fiscal deficit is not large, and the newly issued banknotes are very few, so the stability of finance and prices has been achieved. However, some deviations have also occurred in our work. Some deviations and problems have occurred in our work of collecting agricultural tax, collecting industrial and commercial tax, and issuing public bonds. The people have expressed their dissatisfaction with these deviations and problems. We must correct these deviations and problems. For example, in the work of collecting public grain, there are phenomena of unevenness in regions and in the burden surface. The burden surface is too narrow, so the phenomenon that some people bear too heavy a burden is relatively large. In terms of urban taxation, there are also cases of unevenness and tax evasion. There are too many tax items, some are repeated, and some are unclear. The method of calculating tax and the method of valuation are not unified, and many procedures are wrong. These deviations should mainly be borne by the top, that is, by the financial and economic authorities, and should not be blamed on the tax workers.

The tax personnel of the People's Government have generally done their duty. They are ordered to collect all the taxes due to ensure the needs of the national finance. Without their efforts, this arduous task cannot be completed. This should not be called "greed for merit," but should be said that they are doing their duty. But deviations exist. The cadres sent from the old areas to the new areas are unfamiliar with the place, do not understand the situation very well for a while, and lack experience. The personnel who originally worked in the old government and were retained by us accounted for the majority of the tax personnel. Many of them are good and conscientious, but some of them still follow the bad habits of the past without change, and at the same time, a small number of corrupt elements have been found. All these bad phenomena are mainly due to our insufficient education for them. Once sufficient education work is implemented and the work style is rectified, these bad phenomena can be eliminated.

Based on the work in the past period, we have gained considerable experience and are confident that we can do a good job in our tax work. In order to make our tax work fully comply with the provisions of the Common Program on tax policy, that is, "The state's tax policy should be based on the principle of ensuring the supply of revolutionary war, taking care of the restoration and development of production, and meeting the needs of national construction, simplifying the tax system, and implementing reasonable burdens." The People's Government should take the following measures in a step-by-step manner.

Regarding agricultural tax:

1.  Only tax major agricultural products. All miscellaneous taxes that hinder the development of agriculture, rural sideline occupations, and livestock are not levied.
2.  In order to take care of the current rural economic situation and encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production, appropriately reduce agricultural taxes and must be collected in accordance with the prescribed standards, not allowed to be raised or lowered. The decision on the summer levy of public grain in the newly liberated areas in 1950, which was recently announced by the Government Administration Council, has started this work.
3.  Agricultural tax should be based on the usual yield as a fixed standard. For the part of the usual yield that farmers exceed through hard work, no additional tax should be levied to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production.
4.  The transaction tax in rural areas should stipulate an appropriate starting point for tax collection. Only relatively large transactions of goods should be taxed, and very small transactions by farmers should not be taxed.

Regarding industrial and commercial tax:

1.  Continue to implement the tax policy of industry being lighter than commerce and daily necessities being lighter than luxury goods.
2.  The collection shall not exceed the tax rate that should be levied.
3.  Implement simplified tax items. It is planned to reduce more than 200 tax items, and simplify and merge more than 200 tax items (for example, various cotton textiles are unified into cotton yarn for one-time tax collection, and various wool textiles are unified into wool yarn for one-time tax collection), and the two items total more than 500 tax items.
4.  In order to facilitate the vast consumers, implement a reduction in salt tax.
5.  Unify the tax calculation method and the valuation method, and make a unified explanation according to the actual situation.
6.  According to the differences in industrial and commercial development and accounting systems in various regions, the collection of industrial and commercial tax is divided into three methods and collected according to the tax rate, namely: (1) industrial and commercial enterprises with sound accounting systems that can be used as a basis for collection should adopt the method of self-reporting and actual collection, combined with account checking; (2) those who do not meet the above standards should adopt democratic evaluation, but still need to collect tax according to the tax rate; (3) small-scale industry and commerce and small towns that have difficulties in both account checking and democratic evaluation should adopt the method of regular fixed tax amount.
7.  Major cities shall establish tax review committees, which shall be composed of personnel from the tax bureau, the industry and commerce bureau, and the federation of industry and commerce to review matters related to tax amount and penalties.

Regarding tax personnel:

In order to ensure that the tax personnel of the People's Government have the necessary policy mind, the necessary tax knowledge, and a good work style, and unanimously adhere to the policy, cooperate with the people without causing dissatisfaction among the people, without having bureaucracy and commandism, and at the same time must block loopholes and be honest and dedicated, the People's Government must strengthen the education work for tax personnel and must achieve effective results in the summer, autumn, and winter seasons of this year.

The above are my opinions on the three issues of the economic situation, adjusting industry and commerce, and adjusting taxation. Please review whether they are appropriate.

In the past three months, the Central Ministry of Labor convened a meeting of labor bureau chiefs of various provinces and cities, the Financial and Economic Commission of the Government Administration Council convened a meeting of industry and commerce bureau chiefs of major cities, and the Central Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of tax bureau chiefs of major cities to discuss in detail issues related to labor-management relations, adjusting industry and commerce, and adjusting taxation. Representatives of private industry and commerce participated in these three meetings. What I am reporting now is mostly the common opinions and conclusions of these meetings, especially the latter two meetings.

Our country and people still have many difficulties at present. In order to successfully complete the tasks in the economic and financial aspects, we request all military, government, public, and teaching staff to be responsible and automatically save money, and strictly practice saving all possible expenses; properly organize the staffing of military and government agencies, and all military, government, public, and teaching staff who are ordered to transfer to work areas should actively go to the transfer and reduce the waste of national manpower and funds; thoroughly clean up the warehouse; and fully reorganize the operation of state-owned enterprises and increase the task of handing over to the national treasury. At the same time, we request the national industrial and commercial circles to pay taxes actively in accordance with the tax regulations and eliminate evasion. We request trade unions, federations of industry and commerce, and trade associations and all employees in various places to assist tax personnel in completing the national tax collection task. Our purpose is to achieve the restoration and development of the people's economy, while reducing and eliminating the national fiscal deficit. We believe that as long as the government and the people work together, this goal can be achieved, and our country has unlimited prospects.

    关于经济形势、调整工商业和调整税收诸问题
    （在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上的报告）
    陈云诸位委员，诸位同志：
    自从中央人民政府成立到现在，时间过了八个月。在这个时期中，政务院和财政经济委员会在财政经济方面做了一些工作。其中有几项是有关整个国家和广大人民的，这即是：统一国家财政经济工作的管理和领导，征收粮税发行公债以平衡国家财政收支、稳定通货和物价，接管建立和着手恢复各项国营工商金融业，投资运输事业、水利事业、农业和若干工业，调整公私关系和劳资关系，调运粮食供应大城市，拨出粮款救济灾民和失业工人等。这些工作，有些有了显著的成绩，有些才开始看见成绩。各项工作成绩都有赖于全国广大人民群众、各级政府工作人员和各界民主人士的支持、协助和努力工作，方才取得的。各项工作中都有缺点，有些则犯了若干错误，大都由于不明情况和缺乏经验而来，正在给以改进。今后任务是坚持和发扬已经取得的胜利和成绩，巩固这些胜利和成绩，总结经验，分析情况，教育干部，谨慎从事，努力以赴，逐步实现共同纲领上所规定的各项财经任务，以副全国人民的期望，为争取整个财政经济状况的根本好转而斗争。此次我要向全国委员会第二次会议报告的，是关于目前经济战线上的一般形势，关于调整工商业和关于调整税收这三个问题，因为这些问题是大家所关心的。
    （一）关于目前经济战线上的一般形势
    我们国家的经济和财政状况，目前正处在一个重大的历史转折点。这就是在全国范围内改造半殖民地半封建经济而为独立自由的新民主主义经济的历史转折点，由落后到进步的历史转折点，由坏情况到好情况的历史转折点。
    帝国主义和国民党反动派的统治所造成的长期的通货膨胀和商业投机，这是落后的，是坏情况。不改变这种坏情况，我们就不可能稳定经济和市场的秩序，并使社会的生产事业和商业沿着正当的轨道前进。这是我们在全国范围内建立新民主主义的经济秩序和改造国民经济的一个非常重要的开端。现在可以说，我们在这个问题上开始取得了胜利。当然，我们丝毫不能自满，因为我们的伟大事业还在将来，我们在经济战线上的任务是很多，很重大。帝国主义和国民党反动派的统治留给人民的许多灾难，还待我们一步一步地去消除，战争的创伤还待我们去医治，人民还有很多的困难。而且我们在这个工作上还缺乏经验，我们只能在工作中逐步积累经验。但是，应该承认：我们已经取得的一批胜利，即财经工作业已实行统一，财政收支业已接近平衡，通货和物价业已趋于稳定，这些工作，无疑是做得对的，是我们国家经济状况开始好转的表现。最广大的人民已经看到并开始得到通货稳定和物价稳定的利益。不少有远见的爱国的民族资本家，也已经开始领会到这种稳定对于他们将来的营业是会有好处的。
    目前工商业界发生了许多困难，这是由于以下几种情况而来的：第一是由于通货和物价的稳定，暴露了同时又停止了过去社会上的虚假购买力。这就是说，人们在过去十余年的通货膨胀时期，为了避免钞票跌价的损失，不愿存放钞票，宁愿竞购和囤积并不是为了消费的货物。现在这种情况已经起了变化。他们不但不再囤积货物了，而且将过去囤积的货物吐到市场上来。这样就形成市场上若干物资一时供过于求，生意不好，许多工商业者发生困难。这种情况是极暂时的，原来囤积的货物一经销完，供求关系即将走向正常状态。第二是过去适合于殖民地半殖民地经济中发展的若干工商业，由于帝国主义制度、封建制度和官僚资本制度在中国的消灭，许多货物根本失去市场，另有许多货品也不合人民需求的规格。这种情况引起了一部分工商业的倒闭，从而发生一部分工人失业的现象，须要救济及转业。第三是许多私营企业机构臃肿庞大，企业经营方法不合理，成本高，利润少，或者还要亏本。这也引起许多工商业发生缩小营业、甚或停工歇店的现象。必须重新调整，才有出路。第四是经济中的盲目性，同一行业内部盲目竞争，地方与地方之间供求不协调。这也引起许多减产、停工、倒闭的现象。至于因为长期战争，人民购买力大为降低，使得工商业不景气，则是人人共见的现象。
    所有这些，都是历史遗留给我们的。这些问题现在之所以突出，是因为长期间存在的半殖民地半封建的经济情况现在发生了根本的变化。变化虽然有痛苦，但这种变化的性质，却并不是坏的，它将走向新生，走向重建，走向繁荣，走向健全的新民主主义经济的建立。这种变化是伟大的人民革命的结果。革命推翻了帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义的统治，破坏了这个反动统治的经济秩序，正如毛主席所说：“整个社会经济结构在各种不同的程度上重新改组”，这就是现在所发生的变化。这个变化在暂时说来确是一种痛苦，一种困难，但是走向新生，走向重建，走向繁荣的一种痛苦和困难。整个地说来，它是带暂时性的。毛主席分析了老解放区和新解放区两种情况，指出上述的痛苦和困难，现在只是新解放区的现象；在老解放区，则这种痛苦和困难的问题或者已经解决，或者接近于解决了。毛主席举出解决这种痛苦和困难问题的三个条件，即（一）土地改革的完成；（二）现有工商业的合理调整；（三）国家机构所需经费的大量节减；而这些条件是在三年左右的时间内可以在全国范围内争取其实现的。一切在经济问题上的悲观论点是毫无根据的。这就是我们对中国目前经济战线上的一般形势的简单分析。
    （二）关于调整工商业
    调整工商业这个题目中，问题很多。它包括调整公营工商业与私营工商业之间的关系问题，调整公营与公营之间的关系问题，调整私营与私营之间的关系问题，调整工业与商业之间的关系问题，调整金融业与工商业之间的关系问题，调整城乡关系问题，调整国内各区域间关系问题，调整各企业内部关系问题和调整出入口关系问题等。我在这里，主要地只说人民政府对于调整公私关系这个问题上的一些政策和办法。
    人民政府是保护民族工商业的，这点大家早已知道。共同纲领承认了有益于国计民生而不是操纵国计民生的一切私人资本主义经济的存在和发展。在工业落后的中国，在一个长时期内，民族资本家发展工业，向工业投资，是带进步性的，是对国家和人民都有利的。虽然中国商业资本在大城市中过于膨胀，但是，同时我们了解，中国是散漫小生产占优势的大国，私商的存在是不可免的。为着发展商品的交流，国家允许私人资本经营商业，这也是对于国家和人民都有利的。人民政府保护一切有利于国计民生的资本家的利益，但同时反对一切有害于国计民生而从事投机捣乱的人们的行为。国营经济是一切社会经济成份的领导力量。以上这些是我们今天进行调整公私经济关系的诸项工作的基本出发点。
    关于人民政府对公私经济关系的基本政策，共同纲领第二十六条写得很明白，很妥切，即：“国家应在经营范围、原料供给、销售市场、劳动条件、技术设备、财政政策、金融政策等方面，调剂国营经济、合作社经济、农民和手工业者的个体经济、私人资本主义经济和国家资本主义经济，使各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展。”由此可见，所谓公私关系是包括五种社会经济成份的关系而言。今天我在这里不准备详细说明所有这些关系的一切问题，只说明现在必须而且可能解决的一些问题。
    我们认为，为使目前公私关系取得一定的协调，减轻目前在我国经济的历史转折点所发生的困难，人民政府应当采取如下的各项措施。
    在工业方面：
    一、只要有可能，即由政府和国营企业委托私营工厂加工及向私营工厂订货。政务院财政经济委员会将统一组织各国营企业和机关部队所需要的加工订货的定单，希望做到一年分两次把这些定单分配给公私工厂，订立合同，以便公私工厂能够有计划地组织生产。
    二、政府收购一部分农产品，并给目前还难出口但是可能争取出口的工业品以便利条件，借以扩大工业品在国内外的市场。
    三、联合公私力量，组织工业资金的周转。
    四、号召私营企业改善经营方法，改善劳资关系，共同克服企业中的困难。
    五、为了调整公私企业的关系，政府准备有步骤地把国营企业以外各机关各部队各团体分散经营的生产事业统一起来，并加以调整，使之与私人企业、手工业和农民副业相协调而不相冲突。
    六、随时公告全国，那些产业部门的生产暂时已经过剩，或已达饱和点，使人们知所趋避，减少盲目从事的弊害。
    七、有重点地举办失业救济，尽量把失业者组织起来参加国家公共工程，例如兴修水利，修建市政工程等。
    在商业方面：
    一、照共同纲领规定：“国营贸易机关应负调剂供求、稳定物价和扶助人民合作事业的责任。”这里要求政府依照经济情况，随时规定一个适当的价格政策，即是要把批发价与零售价、地区与地区间的差价，保持一种适当距离。这种距离的限度，要使零售商人和远地商人有适当的利益可图，借使商业畅通，便利于恢复和发展生产。
    二、国营贸易机关所设的零售店和百货公司，其数量以能够稳定零售市场价格，制止投机商人扰乱市场为限度。零售店只卖粮食、煤炭、纱布、食油、食盐、石油六种人民日用必需品。国营批发公司的责任，在于回笼货币，稳定批发价格。
    三、农产品有无销路和销得快慢，是一件有关民生的大事。目前国营贸易机关的收购范围，还只能是主要农产，外销物资及主要农业副产的一部分。其余部分，必须鼓励合作社和私商收购。
    四、必须维持农产品的适当价格，保护农民正当的生产利益，但又必须照顾销路和运销利润，借以使农产畅销，方于农民有利。
    五、为了加速城乡物资交流，使农民与城市人民都受其益，地方人民政府对私商的运销手续及运输条件，应给以充分的便利，并在税收政策和税收手续上给以适当的照顾。
    在金融业方面：
    这方面目前可以说的是这样一点，即国家银行继续赞助公私行庄联合贷款，并在现有基础上逐步扩大其业务。
    在工商界组织方面：
    为了调整公私企业关系，随时协商有关问题，公营和私营工商业以合组同业公会和工商业联合会为适宜。
    上述各方面措施，有些已开始实行，有些正准备实行。其中关于工业方面的第一个措施，即由政府和国营企业委托私营工厂加工及向私营工厂订货，不论是对于整个国民经济或对于私营工业来说，在今天所占的地位都是比较重要的。关于此项措施，我们认为应当遵守以下两项办法：
    第一、委托私营工厂加工或向私厂订货时，加工费或货价的成本计算，不应该依照各个工厂生产技术的高低来计算，应该依照同一地区一般工厂在合理经营条件之下的中等标准来计算。这种加工费或货价的标准，同样适用于公私工厂。对于某些产品的加工或订货，如果政府和国营企业方面并非为了自己的需要，只是为了维持私营工厂的生产不使停顿，在这种情况下，为了减轻政府和国营企业的负担，私营工厂的加工费和货价的计算，应该低于一般正常的加工费和货价。但是所有加工订货的价格与交货条件，均需双方同意，成交与否，悉听自愿。
    第二、为使加工订货的定单，适当分配于各公私工厂，凡属政府和各国营企业的加工订货单，均需经过当地人民政府工商局的经管分配，当地的工商联、总工会、同业公会、产业工会均需协助进行，保证履行合同，按时、按量、按质、实行货款两清。
    我们相信，上述各方面的措施，如能顺利执行，对于全国工商业度过目前的困难，是能有所帮助的。
    此外，有些人提议由政府制订投资条例或公司法。我们认为有此必要，现正在起草中。
    关于调整公私经济关系的问题，现在我要说的就是这些。
    （三）关于调整税收
    从今年三月统一全国财经工作以来，国家财政出现了收支接近平衡的新局面。由于三、四、五这三个月的财政收支接近平衡，财政赤字不大，增发的钞票很少，也就取得了金融物价的稳定。但是，我们的工作也出现了一些偏差。在我们的征收农业税、征收工商业税和发行公债等项工作方面，都出现了一些偏差，发生了一些毛病。人民对于这些偏差和毛病，已经表示了他们的不满意。我们必须改正这些偏差和毛病。例如征收公粮的工作，在地区上和在负担面上有畸轻畸重的现象，负担面太窄，使得一部分人负担过重的现象是比较地多。城市税收方面，同样有畸轻畸重的情况，也有逃税漏税的情况。税目太多，有的重复，有的不明确。计税方法和估价不统一，许多手续错误。这些偏差，主要应由上面负责，即应由财经主管机关负责，而不应责备税务工作人员。
    人民政府的税务人员一般地是尽了职的。他们受命要把应征税额全部征起，以保证国家财政的需要，没有他们的努力，是不能完成这个艰巨任务的。这不应当叫他们为“贪功”，而应当说他们是尽职。但是偏差是存在的。由老区派往新区去的干部，人地生疏，一时不甚了解情况，经验又感不足，有些人作风生硬。原在旧政府工作由我们留用下来的人员占了税务人员的大多数。他们中许多人是好的，是尽职的，但有些人则还是沿袭过去的不良作风没有改变，同时也发现了少数贪污腐化分子。所有这些不良现象，主要地是由于我们对他们教育不足而来。一经实施充分的教育工作，整顿作风，这些不良现象便可以消除。
    根据过去时期的工作，我们已取得了相当丰富的经验，有把握使我们的税收工作做好。为使我们的税收工作完全符合于共同纲领关于税收政策的规定，即“国家的税收政策，应以保障革命战争的供给、照顾生产的恢复和发展及国家建设的需要为原则，简化税制，实行合理负担。”人民政府应当有步骤地采取以下各项措施。
    关于农业税方面：
    一、只向主要农产物征税，凡有碍发展农业、农村副业和牲畜的杂税，概不征收。
    二、为着照顾目前农村经济的情况，鼓励农民的生产积极性，恰当地减轻农业税、并必须按照规定的标准征收，不许提高，也不许降低。最近政务院公布的一九五○年的新解放区夏征公粮的决定，已开始了此项工作。
    三、农业税应以通常产量为固定标准。对于农民群众由努力耕作而超过通常产量的部分，不应加税，借以鼓励农民的生产积极性。
    四、农村中的交易税，应该规定一个恰当的起征点，只是对于比较大量的货物交易才去征税，对于农民很小数量的交易则不应征税。
    关于工商税方面：
    一、继续执行工轻于商和日用品轻于奢侈品的征税政策。
    二、征收不得超过应征的税率。
    三、实行简化税目。准备减少的税目有二百余种，简化合并的有二百余种（例如各种棉织品统一于棉纱作一次征税，各种毛织品统一于毛纱作一次征税），两项共减去五百余种。
    四、为便利广大的消费者，实行减轻盐税。
    五、统一计税方法和估价方法，并按照实际情况作统一的解释。
    六、根据各地工商业发展及会计制度的差别状况，工商税的征收分为三种方法，依照税率征收，即：（一）工商企业有健全的会计制度可资为征收确据的，采用自报实征，配合查账的办法征税；（二）不合前项标准的，采用民主评议，但仍须根据税率去征税；（三）小工商业及小城镇，用查账和民主评议两项办法都有困难的，采用定期定额的征税办法。
    七、各大城市设立税各复议委员会，由税务局、工商局、工商联合会三方面派员组成，复议有关税额及处罚事项。
    关于税务工作人员方面：
    为使人民政府的税务人员具有必需的政策头脑，必需的税收知识和良好的工作作风，全体一致地做到严守政策，与人民合作而不要引起人民不满，不要有官僚主义和命令主义，同时必须堵塞偷漏，廉洁奉公，人民政府必须加强对于税务人员的教育工作，并须在今年的夏秋冬三季确实收到成效。
    以上是我对于经济形势，对于调整工商业，对于调整税收这三项问题的意见，是否有当，请予审议。
    最近三个月来，中央劳动部召集了一次各省、市的劳动局长会议，政务院财经委员会召集了一次各大城市的工商局长会议，中央财政部召集了一次各大城市的税务局长会议，详尽地讨论了有关劳资关系，调整工商业和调整税收诸问题。这三次会议均有私人工商业代表参加。我现在报告的，大都是这些会议特别是后两个会议的共同意见和结论。
    我们国家和人民目前还是有许多困难的，为了顺利地完成经济和财政方面的任务，我们请求全国军政公教职工，人人负责，自动节约，厉行节省一切可能节省的开支；妥善地整理军政机构的编制，一切受命调动工作地区的军政公教职工，踊跃赴调，减少国家在人力和资金上的浪费；彻底清理仓库；全力整理国营企业的经营，增加上缴国库的任务。同时，我们请求全国工商界，遵照税章踊跃纳税，消灭逃漏。请求各地工会、工商联合会和同业公会及全体职工，协助税务人员完成国家征税任务。我们的目的，是要达到恢复和发展人民经济，同时又减少和消灭国家的财政赤字。我们相信，只要政府与人民共同努力，这个目的是可以达到的，我们的国家是有无限前途的。
