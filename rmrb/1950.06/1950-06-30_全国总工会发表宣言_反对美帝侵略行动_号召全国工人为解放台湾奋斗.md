Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a declaration on June 29th opposing US imperialist acts of aggression, as follows:

After directing its running dog, the South Korean Lee Seung-man puppet government’s army, to launch a full-scale attack on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, on June 27th, US imperialism, in the name of Truman, issued a wildly arrogant statement challenging all the people of Asia. In this statement, Truman openly declared that the US government had decided to use force to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. The US Seventh Fleet has also been dispatched to the Taiwan coast on Truman's orders. This series of facts more clearly exposes the true face of US imperialism as a bandit aggressor against China and Asia. Truman stated on January 5th of this year that the United States would not interfere in Taiwan, but now his own statement proves that this was nothing but a deceptive trick.

The US imperialist statement and actions of June 27th, in the eyes of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, are merely a manifestation of the frenzy and recklessness of US imperialism, this paper tiger, under the shock of the Chinese people's unprecedented victory and the power of the world's people's powerful camp of peace and democracy. We warn the vicious war-mongers – US imperialism: The Chinese working class and the Chinese people are a people who have been tempered in the struggle against imperialism and who have already won victory! The Chinese people are not to be bullied! We have already overthrown a Japanese imperialism and the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, which was strongly supported by the United States. If you dare to directly infringe upon the interests of the Chinese people this time, then the road of failure of Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek is waiting for you.

We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou’s solemn statement of June 28th on behalf of our entire nation: “No matter what obstructive actions US imperialists take, the fact that Taiwan belongs to China can never be changed!” We warmly respond to the call of Chairman Mao Zedong and Foreign Minister Zhou that the working class and the people of the whole country should unite more closely, intensify our preparations in all aspects, and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan from the hands of the American aggressors!

The Chinese working class and the Chinese people express sympathy and respect to the people of Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan and other countries who are also suffering from US imperialist aggression and are engaged in resistance struggles. We firmly believe that the people of all China and the world who love peace and democracy, united firmly, will surely be able to stop the new aggression of US imperialist bandits in the East and repel any provocation by US imperialism!

　　全国总工会发表宣言
    反对美帝侵略行动
    号召全国工人为解放台湾奋斗
    【新华社二十九日讯】中华全国总工会二十九日发表反对美帝国主义侵略行动的宣言如下：
    美国帝国主义在指使其走狗南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府军队向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动了全面进攻之后，在六月二十七日，又用杜鲁门的名义发表了一个向全亚洲人民挑战的狂妄声明。在这个声明中，杜鲁门公开宣布美国政府决定以武力阻止中国人民解放台湾。美国第七舰队并已奉杜鲁门的命令开到台湾沿海来了。这一连串的事实，更清楚地暴露了美帝国主义强盗侵略我们中国，侵略亚洲的真面目。杜鲁门在今年一月五日还声明过美国不干涉台湾，现在从他自己的声明中证实了完全是骗人的把戏。
    美国帝国主义六月二十七日的声明及其行动，在中国工人阶级和中国人民看来，只不过是美帝国主义这只纸老虎在中国人民的空前胜利和全世界人民和平民主强大阵营的威力震撼之下，发疯、冒险的表现而已。我们警告穷凶极恶的战争制造者——美帝国主义：中国工人阶级和中国人民，是在反对帝国主义的斗争中久经锻炼、而且是已经获得胜利的人民！中国人民是不可欺侮的！我们已经打倒了一个日本帝国主义，打倒了美国极力支持下的蒋介石国民党的反动统治，如果你们这回竟敢直接侵犯中国人民的利益，那么，日本帝国主义和蒋介石的失败道路，就正在等着你们。
    我们完全拥护周外长六月二十八日代表我们全国人民所发表的严正声明：“不管美国帝国主义者采取任何阻挠行动，台湾属于中国的事实，永远不能改变！”我们热烈响应毛泽东主席和周外长的号召全国工人阶级和全国人民要更紧密地团结起来，从各方面加紧我们的准备工作，为从美国侵略者手中解放台湾而奋斗到底！
    中国工人阶级和中国人民，对于同受美帝国主义侵略并正在进行反抗斗争的朝鲜、越南、菲律宾和日本等国人民，表示同情和敬意。我们坚信：全中国和全世界爱好和平民主的人民巩固地团结起来，一定能够制止美帝国主义强盗在东方的新侵略，击退美国帝国主义的任何挑衅！
