　　I. Basically All Illiterate Employees Participated in Learning

In the literacy campaign in the Dalian area, the Jinzhou Textile Factory is one of the units with the most remarkable achievements. After more than a year of cultural learning, they have eliminated illiteracy for 1,315 people. Of the factory's current 3,568 illiterate employees, 3,428 are participating in learning, accounting for about 97 percent of the total number of illiterate people. Of the 2,870 non-illiterate employees, 2,071 are also participating in learning, accounting for 72 percent of the total number of non-illiterate people. A total of 5,499 people in the factory are participating in learning, accounting for more than 85 percent of the factory's total of 6,438 employees. Those who have not participated in learning are mostly elderly workers and school staff.

　　II. Absenteeism Reduced to Two Percent

The vast majority of employees participating in learning in the factory maintain regular attendance. According to statistics from March and April, the average daily absence in the factory was only three people; early departures and late arrivals were only ten people. In May, in the No. 2 Weaving Workshop, Branch B, among 478 students, absences accounted for only 2.6 percent; early departures and late arrivals accounted for only 1.5 percent. Such a high attendance rate for after-work learning is rare in general factories.

　　III. Results of Cultural Learning

Their teaching progress is very uniform. According to a recent survey, 858 first-year students have learned to the 20th lesson of the literacy textbook (self-edited by the factory), and can recognize about 200 new words. 1,207 second-year students have learned to the 22nd lesson of the second volume, and can recognize more than 500 words. 1,260 third-year students have learned to the 25th lesson of the third volume, and can recognize about 900 words. 991 fourth-year students have learned to the 25th lesson of the fourth volume, and can recognize about 1,100 new words. 1,183 fifth-year students have finished learning the "Creating New Records" textbook and can recognize more than 1,200 words.

The test results are also very good. According to statistics at the end of March, the average score for the first grade in the whole school was 86.6 points; the average for the second grade was 85.5 points; the average for the third grade was 93.7 points; the average for the fourth grade was 94 points; and the average for the fifth grade was 89.3 points. Individual study groups, such as the Wang Shuqing group in the third grade of No. 1 Spinning Workshop, had a perfect score for every member of the group three times, becoming a model group in the factory.

In addition, according to our investigation, among the 71 students at the third-grade level, in terms of reading ability, 58 can now understand the "Workers' Daily"; 8 can understand "People's Daily," "Labor Daily," and other newspapers; and 7 can understand "Democratic Youth." In terms of writing ability, 44 can fill out simple forms; 7 can write short articles; 19 can write simple letters; and 26 can write simple wall newspaper articles. Comrade Qi Dexiang of the No. 2 Weaving Workshop Branch, who was illiterate in the past, can now take notes at group meetings and also write simple summaries. Comrade Qu Zhenxing of the No. 2 Spinning Workshop Branch, who is the administrative director, was illiterate in the past, but now he can not only write the names of various machines but also read technical books.

　　IV. Learning Promoted Production

The workers have not only made significant progress in learning, but they are also excellent in production. Learning not only does not hinder production but also promotes it. From January to April of this year, they completed 117.32 percent of the spinning task and 111.94 percent of the weaving task. In terms of product quality, first-class products accounted for 97.11 percent, second-class products accounted for 2.82 percent, and third-class products accounted for only 0.07 percent. In terms of cost reduction, it decreased by 5.19 percent in January, 4.14 percent in February, 5.10 percent in March, and 4.81 percent in April.

　　V. Party, Government, Trade Union, and Youth League Attach Importance to Employee Learning

The reason why the literacy campaign in the Jinzhou Textile Factory has been so successful is mainly that the leaders of the Party, government, trade union, and youth league attach importance to employee learning and can cooperate closely in their work. For example, the Party branch often consults with the trade union's culture and education department on workers' learning issues, and calls on Party members during Party lectures not only to take the lead as models in production but also to ensure the completion of literacy tasks. The factory director has also repeatedly called on illiterate cadres to participate in literacy learning at administrative cadre meetings and has helped solve the problem of desks and chairs for thousands of people to study. The Communist Youth League has indeed played a promoting and guaranteeing role in the entire literacy campaign. Their work plans for each period include the task of doing a good job in cultural learning, and they often hold meetings with Youth League members, young workers, and "little teachers" to study and discuss specific implementation methods for the literacy campaign, and call on Youth League members to actively participate in learning and teaching and strive to completely eliminate illiteracy within the League. Sometimes they also conduct separate tests of Youth League members' literacy achievements to urge everyone to study hard. Comrade Wang Xingyu, secretary of the No. 1 Spinning Workshop Youth League Committee, is also enthusiastic about participating in school work. Among the 31 branch schools, his branch school is the best-run. The leading comrades of the trade union have consistently attached importance to the literacy campaign. Shortly after the start of the campaign, they hired five full-time teachers to be responsible for teaching literacy classes. At that time, some administrative cadres at the site occupied study time for meetings, and they immediately raised the issue for discussion and resolution at Party and administrative meetings. Liu Tianjun, the director of the trade union, has a firm grasp on workers' education. She asks the teachers for work plans and work summaries every month, and also wants to understand the students' learning enthusiasm and teaching progress. At the same time, she often goes to the classroom to chat with the students, asking them how many words they know and what difficulties they have in learning, and provides specific help.

　　VI. Learning Time is Fully Guaranteed

The learning time for employees of the Jinzhou Textile Factory has been fully guaranteed and has not been squeezed out by meetings or other activities. This year, except for a two-day suspension of classes when the three-shift system was first implemented, and a two-day suspension of classes when the learning production responsibility system was implemented, there has been no day without classes until now. The reasons are as follows:

First, because the responsible comrades of the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League have repeatedly conducted publicity and education at meetings, everyone has ideologically recognized the importance of workers' cultural learning. For example, during a general meeting of No. 1 Spinning Workshop to sign a collective contract, when it was time for free speeches, the study time arrived. The factory director proposed, "The study time has arrived, let's end the meeting here."

Second, the contradiction between learning, meetings, and three-shift production time has been resolved. They stipulate that the first shift works from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and the learning time is from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., and the meeting time is from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. The second shift has meetings and learning earlier, that is, from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. for meeting time, and 2:45 p.m. to 3:45 p.m. for learning time, and the work time is from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. The third shift works from 12:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. the next morning, and the learning time is from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.; 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. is the meeting time.

Third, they have developed a unified meeting system, which specifically stipulates how many meetings the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League need to hold each month or week, and on which day, so that everyone has meeting time and does not need to occupy each other's time.

Fourth, they stipulate that there are five days of cultural learning per week (from Monday to Friday), one day of technical learning (Thursday), and one day of political learning (Friday). Technical and political learning are conducted after cultural learning on the same day, using meeting time, which solves the contradiction in time between cultural, technical, and political learning.

Fifth, in order to cooperate with the trade union to do a good job in learning, the administration has formulated a unified whistle-blowing method according to the learning time, so that workers can work and study on time without any confusion.

Sixth, they have also established a new system this year, that is, the learning time is uniformly controlled by the trade union's culture and education department, and no one can occupy it at will. If workers need to go out for personal matters during learning time, they must go through leave procedures and obtain the consent of the culture and education department.

### 金州纺织厂的职工学习是怎样搞好的？

　　金州纺织厂的职工学习是怎样搞好的？
    旅大总工会文教部
    一、文盲职工基本上全部参加学习
    在旅大地区的识字运动中，金州纺织厂是成绩最显著的一个单位。经过一年多的文化学习，他们已经消灭了文盲一、三一五名。厂内现有的三、五六八名文盲，有三、四二八名参加学习，占文盲总人数的百分之九十七左右。非文盲职工二、八七○名，也有二、○七一人参加学习，占非文盲总人数的百分之七十二。合计全厂有五、四九九人参加学习，占全厂六、四三八名职工总数的百分之八十五强。未参加学习的人，大都是老年工友和学校的工作人员。
    二、缺席人数减低到百分之二
    全厂参加学习的职工，绝大部分均保持经常上课。据三、四两月份统计，全厂每天平均缺席的只有三个人；早退和迟到的只有十个人。五月份二织乙班分校四七八名学员中，缺席的仅占百分之二点六；早退和迟到的只占百分之一点五。业余学习能保持这样高的出席率，在一般工厂内是少有的。
    三、文化学习的成绩
    他们的教学进度很整齐。据最近调查，一年级八五八人，已学到识字课本（该厂自编的）第一册第二十课，能认识生字二百个左右。二年级一、二○七人，已学到第二册第二十二课，能识字五百多个。三年级一、二六○人，已学到第三册第二十五课，能识字九百个左右。四年级九九一人，已学到第四册第二十五课，能认识生字一千一百个左右。五年级一、一八三人，已把创新纪录课本学完，都能识一千二百个字以上。
    测验成绩也很好。根据三月末的统计，全校一年级平均分数为八六点六分；二年级平均八五点五分；三年级平均九三点七分；四年级平均九四分；五年级平均八九点三分。个别的学习组，如一纺三年级王淑清组，曾有三次全组每人都考一百分，成为该厂的典型组。
    另外，根据我们调查，在七十一个三年级程度的学员中，以阅读能力说，现在能看懂职工报的有五十八人；能看懂人民日报、劳动日报及其他报纸的八人；能看懂《民主青年》的七人。以写作能力说，能填写简单表格的四十四人；能写短文的七人；能写简单书信的十九人；能写简单壁报稿的二十六人。二织分校戚德祥工友，过去不识字，现在能在小组会上作记录，同时还能写简单的小总结。二纺分校曲振行同志，他是行政主任，过去一字不识，现在不但会写机器上的各种名称，还可以看技术书籍了。
    四、学习推动了生产
    工友们不光在学习方面有显著进步，在生产方面也是顶好的。学习不独不妨碍生产，而且推动了生产。从今年一月到四月，他们共完成纺纱任务百分之一一七点三二，完成织布任务百分之一一一点九四。在产品的质量方面，一等品占百分之九七点一一，二等品占百分之二点八二，三等品只占百分之零点零七。在降低成本方面，一月份降低百分之五点一九，二月份降低百分之四点一四，三月份降低百分之五点一零，四月份降低百分之四点八一。
    五、党政工团重视职工学习
    金州纺织厂识字运动的所以搞得较好，主要是党政工团领导上重视了职工学习，在工作上能密切配合。如党总支经常找工会文教部门研究工人学习问题，在上党课时号召党员不但在生产上要带头做模范，在学习上也要保证完成识字任务。厂长在行政干部会上，也是三番五次的号召文盲干部参加识字学习，并帮助解决几千人学习用的桌凳问题。青年团在整个识字运动当中，确实起了推动作用和保证作用。他们每期工作计划上，都有搞好文化学习这一项，并经常召开团员、青工、小先生等会议，研究与讨论识字运动具体实施办法，号召团员积极参加学习、参加教学、争取在团内完全消灭文盲。有时还单独测验团员识字成绩，以督促大家努力学习。一纺团支委王兴玉同志，还热心参加学校工作。在三十一个分校中，他这个分校办得最好。工会领导同志对识字运动更是一贯重视。运动开始不久，他们就聘请了五个专任教员，负责教识字课。当时有个别现场的行政干部占用学习时间开会，他们马上就在党的会议和行政会议上提出讨论和研究解决办法。工会主任刘天均，对工人教育抓的很紧，她每月都向教员们要工作计划和工作总结，还要了解学员学习情绪和教学进度。同时，她经常到课堂里找学员们漫谈，问他们识多少字，在学习方面有那些困难，并给以具体帮助。
    六、学习时间得到充分保证
    金州纺织厂的职工学习时间，得到了充分的保证，没有被开会或其他活动所挤掉。今年，除了刚开始实行三班制时停课两天，实行学习生产责任制时停课两天之外，一直到现在没有停止过一天学习。原因如下：
    第一，由于党政工团的负责同志屡次在会议上进行宣传教育，大家在思想上都已认识到工人文化学习的重要。如一纺有一次在签订集体合同的大会上，到自由讲话时。学习时间到了。厂主任就提出说：“学习时间已到，会就开到此地为止吧。”
    第二，解决了学习、开会与三班制生产时间的矛盾。他们规定第一班从上午八时上班到下午四时下班，学习时间从下午四时半学到五时半，会议时间从五时半到六时半为止。第二班提前开会和学习，即从下午一时半到二时半为会议时间，二时四十五分到三时四十五分为学习时间，工作时间是从下午四时到半夜十二时。第三班从半夜十二时到第二天早上八时下班，学习时间从上午八时半到九时半为止；九时半到十时半就是开会的时间。
    第三，他们制订了一种统一的会议制度，把党、政、工、团每月或每周需要开几个什么会，那一天开，都具体的规定好，使得大家都有开会时间，不需要互相占用。
    第四，他们规定每周五天文化学习（从星期一到星期五），一天技术学习（星期四），一天政治学习（星期五）。而技术、政治学习都在当天文化学习以后，利用会议时间进行，解决了文化、技术、政治三项学习在时间上的矛盾。
    第五，行政上为了配合工会把学习搞好，根据学习时间制订统一鸣笛办法，使工友都能够按时工作，按时学习，丝毫不乱。
    第六，他们在今年又订了一条新的制度，就是学习时间由工会文教部统一掌握，任何人不能随便占用。工友们在学习时间内因事外出，也必须履行请假手续，经文教部同意才行。
