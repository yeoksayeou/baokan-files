　　Introducing the International Children's Day Exhibition
    Room 1: Photos of Chinese Children's Lives, etc.
    Room 2: Photos of Soviet Children's Lives
    [Report from our newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Capital's June 1st International Children's Day, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Beijing Library are jointly holding an exhibition celebrating International Children's Day on May 31st at 9:00 AM at the Beijing Library. The exhibition hall is located in the west hall downstairs in the library and is divided into two exhibition rooms. The first room features photos of Chinese children's lives, books, creations, wall newspapers, and photos of the lives of children from North Korea, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and other New Democratic countries, as well as books and creations. There are approximately 300 photos in total. The very realistic and clever large dolls (a miner and a girl) sent to Chinese children by the Hungarian Democratic Women's League, and toys sent to Chinese children by Finland are also on display here. From here, we can see the miserable situation of Chinese children under the devastation of Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the vigorous spirit of children in the liberated areas actively participating in sentry duty, guarding, studying, and production, as well as the happy lives of children in nurseries, kindergartens, and schools in the new China, and the various labor and artistic creations of Beijing primary school students after liberation.
    The second room features photos of Soviet children. Here, we see how the lives, health, wisdom, and creativity of children in a socialist society are valued and nurtured by the state. The story of the Young Pioneers' hiking trip is particularly fascinating. In addition, there are also on display the team flags, scarves, snare drums, bugles, etc., sent by the Soviet Young Pioneers to the Chinese Young Pioneers team. These gifts will inspire every child who visits the exhibition with a spirit of internationalist friendship.
    The exhibition will last for one week, and the opening hours are from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily. (Beijing Democratic Women's Federation)

    【本报讯】首都六一国际儿童节筹委会、苏联对外文化协会及北京图书馆联合举办的庆祝六一儿童节展览会，定于五月三十一日九时在北京图书馆开幕。展览室在图书馆楼下的西边大厅里，共分成两个展览室，第一室是中国儿童生活照片，书籍，创作，壁报和朝鲜、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、捷克、保加利亚等新民主主义国家儿童的生活照片，书籍，创作等。共有照片约三百幅。匈牙利民主妇联送给中国儿童的作得很逼真灵巧的大娃娃（矿工和女孩），和芬兰送给中国儿童的玩具等，都在这里陈列。从这里我们可以看见中国儿童在日寇蒋匪摧残下的惨状，和解放区儿童积极参加放哨、站岗、学习、生产的生气勃勃的精神，以及新中国儿童在托儿所、保育院和学校里的愉快生活，北京市小学生在解放后的各种劳动与艺术创作等。
    第二室是苏联儿童的照片。这里使我们看到社会主义社会儿童的生活，健康智慧和创造力是怎样受到国家的重视与培养，少年先锋队远足旅行的故事尤其引人入胜。此外还陈列着苏联少先队送给中国少年儿童队的队旗、领巾、洋鼓、洋号等。这些礼物，将会激发每一个看过展览会的小朋友的国际主义的友爱心情。
    展览会将展览一星期，每日上午九时至下午六时为开放时间。（北京民主妇联）
