Model League Member Kuang Lianying
　　Luo Guangshang

　　Kuang Lianying is the vice-chairman of the Farmers' Association of the Eleventh Village, Chajiang Township, Fourth District, Shaoyang County, Hunan Province, and is 23 years old this year. Her family was of poor peasant origin, and six or seven people cultivated only a little more than two mu of land, and every year they were short of a large portion of "eating grain". When Kuang Lianying was seventeen years old, she married a man surnamed Yang, and life became even harder. The Yang family only had a few fen of dry land: in a good year, they could only harvest a stone of grain; in a bad year, they wouldn't get anything. Her husband was also an idiot and couldn't work. The lives of the two of them depended on Kuang Lianying's own hands. She worked from dawn to dusk every day, never having a free day. Kuang Lianying had suffered oppression and bullying from the landlords and hooligans in the village since she was a child. She lived through humiliation and pain.

　　After liberation, Kuang Lianying personally witnessed the benefits of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and her political awareness improved. When the Eleventh Village carried out the struggle for rent reduction and deposit refunds, she was the first woman to join the Farmers' Association. Because she worked actively, she was soon elected as the vice-chairman of the Farmers' Association in her village.

　　Once, the village was preparing to struggle against the local tyrant landlord Liu Yao. Because the news had leaked beforehand, Liu Yao fled to a mountain in Qiyang to hide. Kuang Lianying led everyone in reconnaissance for more than ten days and finally found Liu Yao's address. The next morning, she took two militiamen to find him. That day happened to be a day of strong wind and rain. Kuang Lianying, barefoot (she couldn't afford straw sandals), led two militiamen, climbing over rugged mountains. When they arrived in Qiyang, they searched everywhere according to the address, but still couldn't find Liu Yao. Although Kuang Lianying was very anxious, she was not discouraged. Later, she finally found Liu Yao in a small shed. Kuang Lianying went in first to reason with Liu Yao. Liu Yao ran towards the mountains behind the house. Kuang Lianying immediately threw away her umbrella and clothes to chase after him, and caught Liu Yao on the top of the mountain. Kuang Lianying shouted loudly to the militiamen while holding on to Liu Yao tightly. Liu Yao twisted Kuang Lianying's arm with force, causing her to almost roll down the mountain. Kuang Lianying gritted her teeth and grabbed Liu Yao. The two fought in the heavy rain for ten minutes. The militiamen arrived and captured Liu Yao. That day they walked more than eighty li of mountain roads back and forth, Kuang Lianying's feet were torn by thorns and stones, and her hands ached for several days. The peasants made a reasoned struggle against Liu Yao at the struggle meeting. Everyone vented their anger and also recovered more than twenty stone of rent.

　　Another time, when struggling against the landlord Liu Guangyu, Liu Guangyu secretly sent Kuang Lianying several silver dollars, trying to buy her off. Kuang Lianying sternly refused. She said, "Ten thousand taels of gold cannot buy my heart! We will not mess around with those who should not be struggled against; we will not let go of anyone who should be struggled against." Kuang Yinglian was not only active and brave but also mastered the policy of reasonable and legal struggle. The Eleventh Village successively struggled against several local bullies and landlords, and no deviations occurred. Kuang Lianying often said to people, "The Communist Party is thinking of us in every way, leading us to turn over. No matter what we do, as long as we follow the policy, we will definitely be right. If we mess around, we won't be able to turn over properly." Because of these things, after mass evaluation and leadership approval, Kuang Lianying became a glorious Youth League member at the Second District Peasant Congress in the Fourth District. Now that the men are busy with production, she is also leading women in the work of rent reduction review.

　　Kuang Lianying is not only active in struggle but also good at production and study. The Eleventh Village has a small irrigation ditch more than three li long. The riverbed is narrow and shallow, and if the water is slightly larger, it will flood the entire village. To reduce the flood, before and after the spring plowing, Kuang Lianying mobilized the women to cooperate with the men to widen the ditch by a factor of two, greatly increasing the amount of water it could hold. She also led the women to plant melons and vegetables, transport public grain, and earn money to survive the famine. She often summoned women to hold group meetings in the evening, saying, "If women want to fight for equality between men and women, they must work hard themselves." Kuang Lianying deeply understands the pain of illiteracy. In addition to leading production, she also leads women in learning. Every night, she invites some female members of the Farmers' Association to learn to read together, and comrades from the work team come to teach. Everyone enthusiastically said: "If Chairman Mao hadn't come, how would the women in the countryside have books to read?"

　　When Kuang Lianying first started leading everyone in struggle and production, some conservative members ridiculed and said, "What can women accomplish?" Now these words can no longer be heard. The masses call her a model League member and are willing to learn from her.

　　模范团员匡莲英
    罗光裳
    匡莲英是湖南省邵阳县四区槎江乡十一村农会副主席，今年二十三岁。她娘家是贫农成份，六七口人只种了二亩多地，年年“吃粮”要差一大半。匡莲英在十七岁时，嫁给一个姓杨的，日子就更苦了。杨家只有几分干田：年成好，只能收石把谷；年成不好，就什么也捞不到。他的丈夫又是个白痴，不会干活。两口子的生活就靠匡莲英的一双手。她每天从天亮干到黑夜，从来没有一天空过。匡莲英从小就受尽了村里的地主、流氓的压迫和欺侮。她是从屈辱和痛苦中生活过来的。
    解放以后，匡莲英亲眼看见了共产党和人民政府的好处，政治觉悟提高了。当十一村进行减租退押斗争时，妇女中她第一个参加了农会。因为她工作积极，不久当选为本村农会的副主席。
    有一次，本村准备斗争恶霸地主刘尧。因为事先走了风声，刘尧便逃到祁阳一个山上去躲起来了。匡莲英领着大家侦查了十多天，终于查出了刘尧的住址。第二天一早，她就带了两个民兵去找。那天正碰着大风雨，匡莲英赤着脚（没钱买草鞋），带了两个民兵，在崎岖的山岭上翻爬。到了祁阳，她们按着住址到处找，还是找不到刘尧。匡莲英虽然很着急，但并不灰心。后来她在一个小窝铺里终于把刘尧找到了。匡莲英自己先进去和刘尧说理。刘尧撒脚就往屋后的山岭上跑。匡莲英立刻丢了雨伞和衣服去追，在山顶上捉住了刘尧。匡莲英一面大声喊民兵，一面死抓着刘尧不放。刘尧用力扭匡莲英的手臂，痛得她几乎从山顶上滚下来。匡莲英咬紧了牙根，抓住刘尧。两个人在大雨里搏斗了十分钟。民兵赶到，才把刘尧捉住了。这一天来回走了八十多里山路，匡莲英两只脚被荆棘和石头刺烂了，手也痛了好几天。农民们在斗争大会上向刘尧作了说理斗争，大家出了气，还退回了二十多石租子。
    另一次斗争地主刘光裕时，刘光裕曾偷偷地送了几块光洋给匡莲英，想买动她。匡莲英严词拒绝了。她说：“万两黄金也买不动我的心！不应该斗的，我们不乱搞；应该斗的，一个也不放松。”匡英莲不只积极勇敢，还掌握了合理合法斗争的政策。十一村先后斗争了好几个恶霸和地主，没有发生过偏差。匡莲英常常对人说：“共产党处处为我们着想，领导我们翻身。无论什么事情我们只要照政策去办，就一定没错。要是乱搞，翻身就会翻不好。”由于这些，经过群众评议和领导上批准，匡莲英在四区第二次区农代会上，成了光荣的青年团员。现在，男子们正忙着生产，她又在领导妇女搞减租复查的工作了。
    匡莲英不但斗争积极，生产和学习也都不错。十一村有条三里多长的灌田的小涧，河床又狭又浅，水稍微大一点，就满村泛滥。为了减少水患，春耕前后，匡莲英就发动妇女配合男子把涧加宽了一倍，容水量增大了很多。她又领导妇女们种瓜菜、运送公粮，赚钱度荒。她常常在晚上召集妇女开小组会说：“妇女要争取男女平等，就一定要自己好好劳动。”匡莲英深知不识字的痛苦，在领导生产之外，又领导妇女学习。每天晚上邀集农会里的一些女会员在一起学认字，由工作组同志来教。大家都很热心地说：“不是毛主席来了，乡里的妇女那里有书读”。
    当匡莲英刚开始领导大家搞斗争搞生产的时候，有些保守的会员还讥笑说：“女人家能搞出什么名堂来？”现在这些话再也听不到了，群众都称他为模范团员，都愿意向她学习。
