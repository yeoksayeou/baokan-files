　　Malayan People's Armed Forces
    Continue to Strike British Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd dispatch from Singapore] According to a United Press report from Singapore: The new offensive launched by British Malayan Commander-in-Chief Brigadier Briggs against the Malayan People's Armed Forces on June 7th has once again failed to achieve its objectives. Briggs planned to cut off the supply of food and other materials to the Malayan People's Armed Forces through blockades and curfews, thereby "forcing" the Malayan People's Armed Forces in the jungle to come out and fight openly. However, two weeks after the launch of this new offensive, there was no indication that the Malayan People's Armed Forces were in urgent need of supplies, nor were they forced to come out of the jungle to "fight openly." On the contrary, the Malayan People's Armed Forces continued to strike the British colonial army and police with "hide-and-seek tactics." According to a Reuters report from Singapore: Last weekend, the Malayan People's Armed Forces killed and wounded three British colonial police officers each in two attacks in Johor and Pahang. Furthermore, on the 12th, two British colonial officers were killed only thirteen miles from Kuala Lumpur, the capital of the Federation of Malaya.

　　马来亚人民武装
    继续打击英军
    【新华社二十二日讯】据合众社新加坡讯：马来亚英军总司令布里格斯于六月七日向马来亚人民武装所发动的又一次新进攻，仍然没有成就。布里格斯计划以封锁和实行宵禁去断绝马来亚人民武装的粮食和其它物资的供应，从而“强迫”在丛林中的马来亚人民武装出来公开作战。然而，这一新进攻发动两周之后，马来亚人民武装并没有迫切需要供应品的迹象，也没有被迫从丛林中出来“公开作战”的意图。与此相反，马来亚人民武装却以“捉迷藏战术”，继续予英国殖民军警以打击。据路透社新加坡讯：上周末，马来亚人民武装在柔佛州和彭亨州的两次袭击中，击毙和击伤英殖民警察各三名。另于十二日在距马来亚联邦首府吉隆坡仅十三英里处，击毙了两名英殖民军官。
