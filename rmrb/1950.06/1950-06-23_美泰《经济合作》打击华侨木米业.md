Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch from Bangkok: According to delayed news from Bangkok, the U.S. Embassy in Thailand has secretly signed numerous so-called "economic cooperation" treaties with the Thai authorities, with the aim of severely undermining the economic status of Overseas Chinese.

One example of U.S.-Thai "cooperation" is the organization of the "Thai-American Forestry Co., Ltd.," which plans to monopolize the entire Thai forestry industry. To this end, the U.S. and Thailand are now working together to survey Thai forests.

The expansion plan for the Port of Bangkok, approved by the Thai State Council in early March, is an important part of U.S.-Thai "cooperation." According to the Thai Ministry of Transportation, under the guise of joint investment, the port authorities will open American-style large hotels, large docks, transportation companies, rice mills, and other large enterprises.

Note: Currently, most of Thailand's timber and rice industries are operated by Overseas Chinese.

　　美泰《经济合作》打击华侨木米业
    【新华社二十二日讯】据曼谷迟到消息：美国驻泰大使馆已与泰国当局秘密签订了不少的所谓《经济合作》条约，其目的在于严重地打击华侨的经济地位。
    美泰“合作”的例子之一是组织“泰美森林业有限公司”，准备包办全泰国的森林业。为此，美泰双方现已协同进行勘察泰国森林的工作。
    泰国国务院于三月初所通过的扩大曼谷码头方案，是泰美“合作”的重要部分。据泰国交通部消息：在联合投资的名义下，码头当局将开设美国式的大酒店、大船坞、交通运输公司、碾米厂及其它大企业。
    按：目前泰国的木业和米业大部为华侨所经营。
