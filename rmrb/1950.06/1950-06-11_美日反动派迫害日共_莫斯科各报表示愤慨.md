Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th Dispatch from Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS): The Japanese government's immediate execution of MacArthur's directive to strip Communist leaders of their legal status has aroused angry reactions here. This morning, all newspapers published the full text of reports from their London and Shanghai correspondents, with headlines such as "Fascist Methods."

This news aroused not so much surprise as indignation. Everyone sees that the entire course of MacArthur's dictatorial rule is moving in the direction of suppressing the voices of Japanese patriots, because these patriots oppose turning Japan into an American aircraft carrier in the Pacific. Anti-communist measures are being revived under American instigation. Japanese reactionary newspapers are treating the Soviet Union as Japan's "main enemy," the United States plans to exclude the Soviet Union from the Japanese peace treaty, and Dulles's upcoming visit to Tokyo—all of these are seen as milestones in America's intention to establish a pseudo-independent Japan as an American naval and bombing base.

It is noted here that British Dominions such as Australia and New Zealand have abandoned their original positions on the Japanese question. In this regard, it is believed that the closure of the New Zealand Legation in Moscow and the withdrawal of the Australian Ambassador indicate that the governments of these Dominions have now agreed to leave the question of the Soviet Union's status in Pacific affairs to the United States. The official excuse that they are unable to afford the expenses of representatives stationed in Moscow can be regarded as a mere bluff. The price reductions over the past two years have not only compensated for the losses suffered due to the revaluation of the ruble, but have also left a surplus. In addition, Australia and New Zealand have both found the Soviet Union to be their best wool customer and have recently received many millions of pounds in payments.

　　美日反动派迫害日共  莫斯科各报表示愤慨
    【新华社讯】电通社莫斯科七日电：日本政府立即执行麦克阿瑟取消共产党领袖合法地位的指令，已激起此间愤怒的反响。今晨各报都加上“法西斯手法”等类小标题，发表驻伦敦和上海记者的报道全文。
    这一消息与其说引起惊异，无宁说引起愤慨。大家都看出：麦克阿瑟独裁统治的全部过程，都朝着镇压日本爱国者的声息的方向走，因为日本的爱国者反对把日本变成美国在太平洋的航空母舰。反共措施，在美国怂恿之下复活。日本反动报纸把苏联当作日本的“主敌”，美国计划把苏联摈于对日和约之外，以及杜勒斯即将访问东京——大家都把这一切看作美国意欲建立一个作为美国海军基地与轰炸基地的假独立的日本的里程碑。
    此间注意到澳大利亚和新西兰等英国自治领已放弃了他们原先对日本问题的立场。在这一方面，大家认为：新西兰驻莫斯科公使馆的关闭和澳大利亚大使的撤回，表示这些自治领的政府现在已同意把苏联对太平洋事务的地位问题交给美国处置了。说它们无力供给驻莫斯科代表的费用这一个官方的借口，可被认作是虚声恫吓。过去两年物价的低降，不但已补偿了因卢布改订比值而遭受的损失，而且还有余。此外，澳大利亚和新西兰全都发现苏联是他们最好的羊毛主顾，而且最近还获得了许多百万英镑的付款。
