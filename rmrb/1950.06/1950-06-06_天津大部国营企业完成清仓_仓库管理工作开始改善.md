　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 1st—The Tianjin Paper Mill, North China Machinery Company and other sixteen major state-owned factories in Tianjin completed their inventory of warehouse materials in late May, and are now beginning to improve warehouse management systems. During this stocktaking, various units discovered a number of useful materials. The Tianjin Paper Mill cleared up more than 1,500 pieces of unaccounted materials, worth more than 2.2 billion yuan; there were also as many as 174 incorrect accounts. The factory also cleared out four steam gauges and electric paper testers, transformers, automatic circuit breakers and other valuable equipment necessary for current production from waste materials. There were also unaccounted large drying cylinders and calendering shafts for the No. 2 machine, worth 1 billion yuan. Among the materials cleared by the Automobile Repair Factory, which belongs to the North China Machinery Company, are gas furnaces and a large number of engines sufficient to assemble 100 cars. The No. 7 Factory of the China Textile Corporation has 2,000 kilograms of indanthrene dye (worth about 1.2 billion yuan), and the No. 1, 2, and 4 factories also have hundreds of electric and foot sewing machines, which are urgently needed for the current production of clothing factories. All the cleared items are now kept by each factory, pending unified allocation and use by the central government. During this stocktaking, it was found that the shortcomings of materials management were very serious. In addition to the confusion and inaccuracy of accounts, many facts were discovered of huge losses of state property due to the carelessness of warehouse managers. Eighty percent of the ironware stored in the Tianjin Equipment Depot of the North China Electric Power Administration was rusted. The Liuliutai warehouse of the bureau placed a large number of high-voltage porcelain bottles, transformers, motors and other valuable equipment in the open air, or only covered them with a layer of rags, and let them be exposed to the sun and rain. The warehouse management system of the Central Electrical Equipment Factory was also extremely chaotic, and raw iron and other materials were often placed together with waste materials. Through this stocktaking, the warehouse managers of most factories have realized the seriousness of the past shortcomings, made self-criticisms, and begun to improve warehouse management.

　　天津大部国营企业完成清仓
    仓库管理工作开始改善
    【新华社天津一日电】天津市天津造纸厂、华北机器公司等十六个主要国营企业工厂已于上月下旬完成仓库物资的清理工作；并正在着手改善仓库管理制度。此次清理中各单位查出不少有用的物资。天津造纸厂共清出漏账物资一千五百余件，约值二十二亿余元；错误的账目亦有一百七十四起之多。该厂并在废料中清出了为目前生产所必需的四个干汽表和电动纸张试验器、变压器、自动电闸等贵重器材。另有漏账的价值十亿元的二号机大烘缸和轧光轴。华北机器公司所属的汽车修配厂清理的物资中，有足够装配一百辆汽车的煤气炉和大批引擎等物。中纺公司第七厂存有阴丹士林颜料二千公斤（约值十二亿元），第一、二、四厂亦存有电力和脚踏缝纫机数百部，都是被服工厂目前生产所急需的。现清出各物均由各厂保管，以待中央统一调拨、使用。在此次清查中，发现物资管理工作的缺点很严重，除账目混乱和不确实以外，并发现了许多由仓库经管人员的麻痹大意而使国家财富受到巨大损失的事实。华北电业总局天津器材库所存铁器竟有百分之八十生了锈。该局六里台仓库将大批高压磁瓶、变压器、电动机等贵重器材置于露天的空地上，或仅盖一层破布，任其日晒雨淋。中央电工器材厂的仓库管理制度也极为混乱，原铁等物资常与废料放在一起。通过这一次清理工作，大部工厂的仓库管理人员都认识到过去的缺点的严重性，并作了检讨，开始进行改善仓库管理的工作。
