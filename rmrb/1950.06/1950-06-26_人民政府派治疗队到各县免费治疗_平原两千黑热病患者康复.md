The People's Government Sends Medical Teams to Various Counties for Free Treatment
    Two Thousand Kala-azar Patients Recover in Pingyuan

    [Our Newspaper News] Correspondent Chao Han reports: Kala-azar is prevalent in various parts of Pingyuan Province. In order to focus on the prevention and control of this endemic disease, the Provincial People's Government, in addition to designating several hospitals for free treatment, has organized kala-azar medical teams to go to various places to adopt the method of large-scale centralized treatment, providing free treatment for the masses. From August of last year to May of this year, 2,764 patients have been cured in Qinyang, Bo'ai, Jiyuan, and Wenxian. Some patients who were not treated in a centralized manner continue to receive treatment in their respective counties. The Bo'ai Hospital alone has treated 134 people. This treatment work has further strengthened the relationship between the government and the masses, and has enhanced the prestige of Western medicine among the masses, laying a favorable foundation for the future eradication of kala-azar.

    The Kala-azar medical team of the province has explored the following work experiences in organizing treatment during more than half a year of work:

    1. Closely integrate with the local government to mobilize and organize patients: When arriving in a county, a joint meeting should first be held with relevant departments such as the county government, the county committee, the hospital, and the women's federation to jointly select cadres to form a working group. They should regularly do patient organization work to understand the number of patients, mobilize patients, expose rumors, and dispel patients' concerns and actual difficulties.

    In the early stage of opening a clinic, many patients often come to seek treatment ahead of others, regardless of the area; some patients listen to rumors (such as saying that free treatment cannot cure the disease, and that money will still be required after the disease is cured; that so many people have died in a certain place, etc.) and wait and see, resulting in the situation that on the one hand, patients are crowded and cannot be seen; on the other hand, many patients do not come and cannot be fully treated. Therefore, the working group must plan to organize and mobilize patients by region so that a certain number of patients come every day.

    When registration is particularly crowded, to avoid making seriously ill patients wait too long, they can be divided into groups of ten according to the order of arrival and registered by group.

    2. Solve the actual difficulties of patients. This disease requires twelve to fifteen days of treatment. Patients who live nearby can come for injections every day; those who live more than ten miles away need to move in for treatment. Rooms capable of housing more than one hundred to several hundred patients should be found in nearby villages in advance. When there are many patients in a certain district or village, cadres should lead them. If it is cloudy or raining, and the patients cannot bring firewood and rice, the government should find a way to lend it to them, or organize the patients to send a few people from each village back to each household to collect them. This is to stabilize the patients' lives and prevent them from giving up halfway. As for the poor families of revolutionary martyrs or extremely poor people, the county government can provide appropriate relief. Among the thousands of patients treated in Qinyang, the government temporarily lent and relieved more than one hundred kilograms of grain to the patients.

    In hot summer, drinking water should be supplied to patients who come from afar, and suitable places for rest should be found as much as possible. Some people have severe reactions after the injection, such as fever and vomiting, and cannot go back, so appropriate care should be given.

    3. Accurate diagnosis, so that no one slips through the net. Timely check for reactions, and detect complications as early as possible. The medical team should have a scientific division of labor. For example, registration, calling numbers, weighing, writing medical records, filling in dosages, and dispensing medicines all require dedicated personnel to be responsible. Strive for accurate diagnosis, because this disease is sometimes difficult to distinguish from chronic malaria and spotted fever. Therefore, it is necessary to cooperate with laboratory tests, perform various tests, check white blood cells, and even perform spleen punctures.

    Reactions to injections of Neostibosan are very large, especially in winter, when it is easy to suffer from combined pneumonia or die from low blood sugar. Reactions must be checked. If complications are found, the injection should be stopped immediately and treatment should be administered. A ward should be set up near the medical team, specifically for critically ill patients. The medical team in Qinyang once rescued several critically ill children; also, one patient died because complications were not detected in time.

　　人民政府派治疗队到各县免费治疗
    平原两千黑热病患者康复
    【本报讯】通讯员超韩报道：平原省各地黑热病普遍流行。为了有重点的防治此项地方病，省人民政府除指定若干医院免费治疗外，特组织黑热病医疗队赴各地采取大批地集中治疗的方法，为群众免费治疗。自去年八月至今年五月，已在沁阳、博爱、济源、温县治愈患者二、七六四人，一部分没有集中治疗的病人，也在本县继续施治，仅博爱医院已治了一三四人。此次疗治工作，使政府与群众的关系更密切了，并提高了西医在群众中的威信，为今后扑灭黑热病打下了有利的基础。
    该省黑热病医疗队，在半年多工作中，摸索到了下面一些组织治疗的工作经验：
    一、密切结合当地政府，动员与组织病人：每到一县，首先应与县府、县委会、医院、妇联等有关部门开联席会议，共同抽调干部，组成工作组，经常做病人组织工作，以了解病人数目，动员病人，揭破谣言，解除病人的顾虑与实际困难等。
    在开诊初期，往往有许多病人，不按地区，争先来治；一部分病人则听信谣言（如说不花钱治不了病，病好后还是要钱；在某处治死多少人等）观望不来，以致一方面病人拥挤，看不过来；另一方面，许多病人不来，不能全部治疗。因此，工作组必须有计划地分区组织动员，使每天来一定数量的病人。
    在挂号特别拥挤时，为避免使重病人等待过久，可按来到次序，每十人编为一组，按组挂号。
    二、解决病人的实际困难。此病需十二天至十五天的治疗，距离近的病人，可以每天来注射；十里以外，就需搬来治疗，应该在附近村庄预先找好可容百余人至数百人的病房。某区或村病人多时，应有干部领导。如遇天阴下雨，病人拿不来柴米，政府应设法借给，或组织病人，每村派数人回去到各家代取。以安定病人生活，勿使半途而废。至于贫苦的烈军工属或极贫人民，县府可予适当救济。在沁阳治疗千余病人中，曾由政府暂借和救济病人粮食百余斤。
    夏季炎热，病人远路前来应诊，应供应开水，尽可能找适当的休息地点。有的人注射后，反应较重，发烧呕吐，不能回去，应给予适当的照顾。
    三、诊断准确，勿使漏网。及时检查反映，及早发现合并症。医疗队要有科学的分工，如挂号、叫号、称体重、写病历、填药量、配药等，都需有专人负责。诊断务求准确，因为此病有时与慢性疟疾、斑体斯病很难鉴别，所以配合化验，做各种试验，检查白血球，甚至刺脾，都有必要。
    注射牛斯登，反映很大，特别在冬季，容易患合并肺炎或血糖降低而死。必须检查反映。发现了合并症，应立即停止注射，施以治疗。并在医疗队左近，设立病房，专住危急病人。医疗队在沁阳，曾经抢救了几个垂危的小孩；也曾有一病人因合并症未及时发现而死亡。
