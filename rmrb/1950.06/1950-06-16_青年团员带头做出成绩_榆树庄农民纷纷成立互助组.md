Youth League Members Take the Lead in Achieving Results
    Yushuzhuang Farmers Establish Mutual Aid Groups One After Another
    [Our Newspaper] Youth League members in Yushuzhuang, Fifteenth District of Beijing's suburbs, responded to the government's call for increased production by organizing propaganda teams to explain production policies, dispelling the concerns of rich peasants and some middle peasants about increasing production. They also used the practical results of mutual aid in production to motivate farmers and launch a production increase campaign. When the government put forward the call for a 10% increase in production this February, the village's rich peasants were still afraid that hiring long-term laborers would lead to being struggled against in the future. Some middle peasants were also concerned that producing more grain would mean paying more public grain. Therefore, these people's enthusiasm for production was not high. The village's Youth League members first persuaded their own families and organized propaganda teams, using fast-clapper rhymes, Yangko dances, and other forms to carry out propaganda, explaining that the government's policy was to reward labor and become rich through hard work, and that the portion of increased production due to diligence would not be subject to excessive public grain levies. After extensive propaganda and explanation, the farmers began to break down their production concerns. After understanding the policy, the father of League member Zhang Benrong proposed a plan to increase production by 50%, and saved money to buy a large amount of manure for the land.
    When a production increase campaign was launched in the whole village, the Communist Party branch called on farmers to organize production mutual aid groups. Most farmers had no confidence in production mutual aid groups, generally believing that "mutual aid is not as good as not mutual aid, saves trouble." Therefore, although some mutual aid groups were organized, most were merely symbolic and ineffective, and some quickly collapsed. At this time, Wang Jinzhen, a female League member (Communist Party member and branch committee member of the village League branch) in the natural village of Luotuo Village, led three female League members in the same village to form a mutual aid group and actively engaged in production. At first, ordinary farmers looked down on them. But they were not discouraged. They formulated labor allocation methods and rules based on the principle of equal value and mutual benefit. They went to the fields before dawn every day and insisted on literacy learning every night. The work efficiency of the mutual aid group was greatly improved compared to working separately. In the past, a female worker was worth half a male worker, but now each of them surpassed male workers in performance.
    The achievements of Wang Jinzhen's mutual aid group made the farmers truly realize the benefits of mutual aid groups. Those who had already joined mutual aid groups were actively rectifying their original organizations. Many who had not participated before also asked to join mutual aid groups. Now there are thirteen sound mutual aid groups in the whole village. Due to the different labor power of men and women, everyone has studied practical methods of fair mutual benefit and flexible application during busy and slack farming seasons. This is directly promoting increased production.

　　青年团员带头做出成绩
    榆树庄农民纷纷成立互助组
    【本报讯】京郊十五区榆树庄青年团员，响应政府增产号召，组织宣传队，解释生产政策，消除了富农及部分中农对增产的顾虑。他们并以生产互助的实际效果，带动农民，展开增产运动。今年二月间，政府提出增产一成的号召时，该村富农还怕雇了长工，将来被斗。部分中农也顾虑多打了粮食，多缴公粮。因此，这些人的生产情绪都不高。该村青年团员们首先说服自己的家庭，并组织宣传队，利用快板、秧歌等方式进行宣传，说明政府的政策是奖励劳动发家致富，因勤劳增产的部分，并不多缴公粮。经过广泛地宣传解释，农民们开始打破了生产顾虑。团员张本容的父亲在了解政策后，就提出了增产五成的计划，并且省吃俭用，大量买粪上地。
    在全村展开增产运动时，中共支部号召农民，组织生产互助组。一般农民对生产互助组没有信心，大都认为“互助不抵不互助，省得麻烦”。因此，虽组织起来一些互助组，大多徒具形式，不起作用，有的很快就垮了。此时，该村所属骆驼庄自然村中的女团员（中共党员兼该村团支委）王金珍，即带头与同村的三个女团员，组成互助组，积极投入生产。一般农民开始还轻视她们。但她们并没灰心。她们按等价两利原则，订出拨工办法和规则。每天天不大亮就下地，每晚还坚持识字学习。互助组的工作效率较分散工作时大大提高。过去一个女工抵半个男工，现在她们每个人的成绩都超过了男工。
    王金珍互助组的成绩，使农民们真正认识了互助组的好处。已经参加了互助的，都在积极整顿原有组织。很多从前没有参加的人，也都要求参加互助组了。现全村已出现健全的互助组十三个。由于男女劳动力的不同，大家又研究出切合实际的公平互利及农忙时农闲时的灵活运用等办法。对增产直接起着推动作用。
