　　【Chahar News】 The Zhangjiakou City People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held an enlarged meeting on May 20th. The meeting approved that the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Government's focus for June will remain on guiding private industry and commerce to overcome difficulties. In terms of specific measures, in addition to the already established "Labor-Capital Relations Guidance Committee," a "Price Consultation Committee" will be established to ensure that both public and private sectors can obtain profits within a reasonable price range. A "Tax Research Committee" will be established to specifically study tax adjustments, evaluation methods, inspection of payment status, and other related issues. In order to adjust the relationship between the public and private sectors, public-private symposiums for various industries will continue to be widely held and made into regular consultation meetings to promptly exchange information and opinions and resolve issues related to the public and private sectors. In addition, to solve the problem of unemployed workers, the Municipal Labor Bureau will establish a "Labor Registration and Referral Office" to investigate the number of unemployed people and grasp employment opportunities in order to allocate labor. It is also preparing to implement work-for-relief programs, such as road repairs and fly and rat catching in the summer epidemic prevention and sanitation work. In order to ensure the implementation of these tasks, it has been decided to rectify the work style of cadres. Under the supervision and criticism of the broad masses of the people, it will correct the commandist and mass-detached tendencies that exist in some staff members.

　　张市协商委会通过政府工作重点
    指导私营企业克服困难
    【察哈尔讯】张家口市各界人民代表会议协商委员会，五月二十日特召开扩大会议。会议通过了市人民政府六月份仍以指导私营工商业克服困难为工作重点。在具体措施上，除现已组成之“劳资关系指导委员会”外，即将成立“物价协商委员会”，以期在合理价格范围内使公私都能获得利润。成立“税收研究委员会”，专门研究税收的调整、评议办法、检查缴纳情况等各种问题。为了调整公私关系，将继续广泛召开各行业的公私座谈会，并使之成为定期的协商会议，及时交换情况和意见，解决有关公私间的问题。此外，为解决失业职工问题，市府劳动局将设立“劳动登记介绍所”，清查失业人数，掌握就业机会，以调配劳动力。并准备实行以工代赈，如修路及夏季防疫卫生工作中之捕蝇、捕鼠等。为使这些任务得以贯彻执行，并决定进行整顿干部作风。在广大人民监督、批评下，纠正在某些工作人员中存在的命令主义的脱离群众的倾向。
