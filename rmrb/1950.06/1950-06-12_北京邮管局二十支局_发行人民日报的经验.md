　　The Experience of the Beijing Postal Administration's 20th Branch in Distributing the People's Daily

Since the People's Daily decided to entrust its distribution to the post office in March of this year, the Dongsi Pailou 20th Branch of the Beijing Post Office was the first to accept this task. Thanks to the active efforts of all postal workers in the branch over the past two months, great achievements have been made.

First, it is reflected in the speed of distribution, which has been increased from three hours in the past to half an hour now. The branch distributes 1,188 copies of the People's Daily, most of which are within the city. Before the integration of postal and distribution services, it took three hours to deliver them all. After the branch took over, it was reduced to two hours. However, everyone was not satisfied with this. Director Zhao of the branch mobilized everyone to discuss how to increase the speed and create new records. All the staff mobilized, and the suburban deliverymen and substitute deliverymen also participated in the delivery of newspapers. As a result, the distribution speed in the city was tripled—it was completed in half an hour. A comrade in charge of receiving and dispatching at the Central Finance and Economics Committee said, "The newspapers are delivered much faster than before. We often receive the newspapers at 6:30 in the morning, and the number is also very accurate, not missing a single copy. In the past, there were frequent shortages of newspapers."

Secondly, the delivery is accurate. The deliverymen always try to deliver the newspapers to the subscribers themselves. The deliverymen, fearing that subscribers who get up late would not receive the newspapers, agreed with the subscribers on the location where the newspapers would be placed, and the next day they would ask the subscribers if they had seen yesterday's newspaper.

Thirdly, they actively solicit subscriptions. In this area, private distributors and newspaper vendors still distribute many copies of the People's Daily. After the integration of postal and distribution services, some postal workers, in order to actively complete the distribution task, suggested developing newspaper subscriptions from the subscribers of distributors and newspaper vendors. After the leadership explained the distribution policy, explaining that the post office should support, develop, and unite and transform distributors and newspaper vendors to sell our newspapers in large quantities, everyone thought of ways to develop new subscribers in blank spots. They used various methods to carry out extensive publicity, promoting to people who came to the post office to mail letters, to acquaintances and friends, and to neighbors, and even to recipients. In this way, they developed 229 new newspaper subscriptions in less than a month. Among them, 22 were from urban residents, 7 from commercial firms, 5 from factories, and the rest were subscribed to by government agencies and schools. Recently, a subscription blitz week was launched, and more than 30 subscriptions were developed in five days.

These are the main achievements of the 20th Branch in distributing the People's Daily since its inception. This fact proves that the policy of integrating postal and distribution services decided by the National Newspaper Management Conference is completely correct.

The reason why the 20th Branch has been able to achieve such results is due to the following three reasons:

First, the leadership has a correct understanding of distributing newspapers, believing that newspapers are the "leading link" between the Party and the People's Government and the broad masses, and that distributing the People's Daily is a political task that cannot be done or not done, only allowed to be done well, not allowed to be done badly. Therefore, at the beginning of the integration of postal and distribution services, ideological education was carried out universally. First, the thinking of Party members, administrative team leaders, and trade union group leaders was cleared, and activists were organized to persuade those who lagged behind. The leadership also introduced to everyone the heroic and moving deeds of deliverymen in the Liberated Areas during the Anti-Japanese War, who delivered newspapers to the front lines and to enemy areas through blockades. This eliminated the idea that delivering newspapers was dishonorable, troublesome, and tiring, so the work went very smoothly.

Second, praise is given in a timely manner. Those who deliver quickly and those who help each other actively are praised, and the praise and commendations of readers are also told to everyone in a timely manner. This makes all the staff eager to work hard. Because everyone's work enthusiasm is very high, they not only do not feel tired, but also feel very happy.

Third, difficulties are resolved in a timely manner. After the deliverymen took on the task of delivering newspapers, collecting subscription fees, and developing subscribers, the shifts increased from three to four, and sometimes they had to go out to collect subscription fees. After everyone raised the issue and the leadership studied the need to increase the repair fees for bicycles, it was decided to subsidize each person with 18 kilograms of millet per month for bicycle repair fees. As the rainy season approached, the request to add raincoats was also resolved in a timely manner.

The 20th Branch still has areas that should be further improved, such as the procedures and systems are not sound enough. For example, when a reader moved away, the newspaper continued to be delivered for ten days before it was discovered; there is no material reward system for deliverymen, and so on.

### 北京邮管局二十支局  发行人民日报的经验

　　北京邮管局二十支局  发行人民日报的经验
    自今年三月人民日报决定交给邮局发行后，北京邮局东四牌楼二十支局首先接受了这个任务。两个月来在该局全体邮工的积极努力下已有很大成绩。
    首先表现在发行速度上，由过去的三点钟，提高到现在的半个钟头。该局发行人民日报一一八八份，大部分在城内，在邮发合一以前，要三个钟头才能送完。该局发行后，便减为两个钟头。可是大家对此并不满足，该局赵局长发动大家研究讨论，如何提高速度，创造新纪录后，全体员工一齐动员起来，城外投递员和备补投递员也参加送报，这样一来，城内发行速度又提高了三倍——半点钟就送完了。中央财委会的收发同志说：“现在报纸比以前送得快多了，我们经常是早上六点半收到报纸，而且数目也很准确，一份不错，在过去短报的现象经常有。”
    其次就是送的准确，投递员总是想法把报纸交给读者本人。投递员怕起身较迟的订户收不到报，便与订户规定放报地点，第二天还要问订户见到昨天的报没有。
    第三是积极征求订户。这一地区私人代销处和报贩还发行着许多人民日报。邮发合一后，有些邮工同志为了积极完成发行任务，提议向代销处和报贩的订户发展报纸，经过领导方面解释了发行政策，说明邮局对代销处和报贩应当扶植发展和团结改造来大量推销我们的报纸后，大家便想办法向空白点发展新订户。利用各种方式展开了广泛宣传，向来邮局寄信的人，向熟人和朋友以及邻居，甚至于向收信人都进行宣传。这样不到一月便发展报纸二百二十九份。其中市民二十二户，商号七户，工厂五户，其余是机关学校订的。最近又发动了订阅突击周，五天内就发展了三十多份。
    这些就是二十支局发行人民日报以来的主要成绩，从这个事实中可以证明全国报纸经理会议决定的邮发合一的方针是完全正确的。
    二十支局所以能获得这样的成绩，是有以下三个原因的。
    第一是领导思想上对发行报纸，有正确的认识，认为报纸是党和人民政府与广大群众联系的“引带”，发行人民日报是一个政治任务，不是可作可不作的问题，只准作好，不准作坏。所以在邮发合一开始，就普遍的进行了思想教育，首先打通党员、行政组长、工会小组长的思想，组织积极分子向落后者进行说服工作。领导上又把过去解放区抗日战争时期的投递员往前线送报、往敌区送报通过封锁线等英勇动人的光荣事迹向大家介绍。这样就把送报不光彩、嫌麻烦、怕劳累的思想消除了，因此工作进行得很顺利。
    第二是及时进行表扬。报送的快和互助积极的都表扬，又把读者的称赞和表扬也及时的讲给大家听，这样就使得全体人员都争先恐后的工作。由于大家工作热情很高，不但不觉累，反而感到很愉快。
    第三是及时解决困难。投递员自担负了送报、收报费、开展订户的任务以后，班次由三班增到四班，有时还要出去收报费，经过大家提出和领导方面研究需要增加修车费后，便决定每人每月津贴十八斤小米修车费。雨季到来了，添置雨衣的要求也及时解决了。
    二十支局目前还有应该进一步改进的地方，如手续制度不够健全，有一个读者走了，报纸还继续送了十天才发觉；对投递员没有规定物质的奖励制度等等。
                                                      （赵国臣）
