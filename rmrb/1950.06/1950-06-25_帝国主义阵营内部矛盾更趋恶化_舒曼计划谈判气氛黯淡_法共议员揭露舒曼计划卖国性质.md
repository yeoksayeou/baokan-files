Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow: "Pravda"'s Paris correspondent Zhukov, in a report on the gloomy atmosphere as six Western European satellite states of the United States began negotiations on the so-called "Schumann Plan," stated that the Schumann Plan negotiations exposed the further deterioration of internal contradictions within the imperialist camp. Britain has frankly refused to participate in the negotiations, and the six-nation conference obviously intends to compete with Britain, which powerfully exposes how hypocritical the United States' propaganda about Western European "unity and harmony" is. On the opening day of the conference, the British "Sunday Express" even published a long article entitled "Who is Schuman?" which detailed that the current French Foreign Minister was originally an officer in the army of the German Emperor Wilhelm. Schuman felt extremely uncomfortable about this article, but it delighted the people of Paris.

Zhukov further pointed out: In his opening speech at the conference, Schuman repeatedly emphasized that abandoning national sovereignty was the most important feature of the plan. However, such remarks, once outside the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, could not gain enthusiastic support.

Coincidentally, at the same time that Schuman was giving his speech at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the French National Assembly also began to review a clause in the 1950 national budget related to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Deputies from various parties expressed anger at the government for starting the Schumann Plan negotiations without informing the parliament and demanded that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explain the matter. The first speaker, the right-wing deputy Morin, angrily denounced Schuman's policy of surrender. Communist deputy Biscarlet pointed out the treacherous essence of the Schumann Plan. He listed that when the Schumann Plan was proposed, seventy mines in France had already closed down, and another twenty-five would soon suffer the same fate, followed by a staggering increase in unemployment, while the war factories in the Ruhr area would be working intensely day and night. Deputies of various political factions successively expressed their opposition to the Schumann Plan and warned the public about the consequences of this plan.

　　帝国主义阵营内部矛盾更趋恶化
    舒曼计划谈判气氛黯淡
    法共议员揭露舒曼计划卖国性质
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫报道西欧六个美国附庸国家在开始所谓“舒曼计划”谈判时的黯淡气氛称：舒曼计划的谈判，暴露了帝国主义阵营内部矛盾已更趋恶化。英国已直率地拒绝参加谈判，而六国会议则显然有意要与英国抗衡，这就有力地暴露了美国所谓西欧“团结和谐”的宣传是多么虚伪。在会议开幕的那天，英国的《星期快报》上竟发表了一篇长文，题目叫做《舒曼是谁？》其中详细说明目前法国外交部长的出身，原来是德国威廉皇帝军队中的一名军官，舒曼对这篇文章感到异常地不舒服，然而却使巴黎人心大快。
    朱可夫又指出：舒曼在会议的开幕词中再三强调放弃国家主权是该计划最重要的特点。但是，这种言论出了法国外交部的大门，就不能获得热烈的支持。
    与舒曼在外交部发表演说的同时，法国国民议会很凑巧地也开始了审查一九五○年度国家预算中有关外交部的一条。各党派的议员对于政府不告诉议会就开始进行舒曼计划谈判一事，表示愤怒，并要求外交部说明事情的原委。第一个发言的右翼议员摩林愤怒地斥责舒曼的投降政策。共产党议员比斯卡列指出舒曼计划的卖国本质。他列举舒曼计划提出时法国已有七十家矿场倒闭，另外二十五家不久也要遭受同样的命运，随着而来的将是失业人数的惊人上升，而鲁尔区的战争工厂却会日以继夜地紧张工作。各种不同政治派系的员议，都相继明白地表示他们反对舒曼计划，并警告公众这个计划会发生什么后果。
