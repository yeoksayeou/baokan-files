Xinhua News Agency, Dihua Telegram: The People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region troops have overfulfilled their spring ploughing production tasks. As of early May, the entire army has reclaimed 673,500 mu of land (exceeding the original plan of 600,000 mu by 12.2%); sown 430,000 mu; and built a huge water conservancy project capable of irrigating over one million mu of land.

Before the spring ploughing, the Military Region called on the entire army to ensure the success of the production tasks set by the Military Region, "Only success is allowed, failure is not; only exceeding is allowed, no reduction is permitted." The commanders and fighters responded to the call from their superiors with practical actions, overcoming all difficulties with a fighting spirit. They made their own tools and built their own barracks and tents; disregarding the freezing cold, the blisters on their hands, and the swelling of their feet from the alkaline water (Xinjiang land is highly alkaline and must be irrigated before reclamation to remove the alkalinity), they enthusiastically launched a large-scale production campaign.

The Chinese Communist Party branches and all Communist Party members in the companies played a decisive role in overcoming these difficulties and ensuring the completion of production tasks. The production plan and major issues in production were first discussed and studied in detail by the Communist Party branch committee, and then the entire command and fighters were mobilized and organized to consciously implement them. The soldiers expressed one after another: they would strive to earn merit in production and strive to join the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. During the spring ploughing period, 56 outstanding soldiers from a certain regiment gloriously joined the Communist Party, and 211 young soldiers gloriously joined the Communist Youth League.

Across the vast reclaimed wilderness of the motherland's frontier, bright red flags fluttered everywhere, and the soldiers raced forward towards the victorious red flags, with joyful songs rising one after another.

The blackboard newspapers and broadcasting stations of each company powerfully encouraged the production enthusiasm of the commanders and fighters.

New production records are constantly emerging. In a certain company repairing canals, the average person moved 19 cubic meters of earth per day; Niu Qinghai, the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary of a certain company who had participated in the Great Production Movement in Nanniwan, Shaanxi, created a record of reclaiming 3.35 mu of land in one day.

The hard work of the people's soldiers is changing the face of the motherland's frontier and transforming themselves at the same time.

In production, some units also had some biases and shortcomings. Some troops neglected scientific production knowledge and production technology. One unit, unable to use a foreign plow, said that the foreign plow was not good and continued to use hoes to cultivate the land. Some canal-building troops neglected the guidance of science and technology, resulting in a waste of labor. Some leading cadres took the soldiers to the fields every day and only said to them: "Dig!" Some did the same work as the soldiers, abandoning the planning, organization, and leadership of production work. At the production representative meeting held by a certain army in southern Xinjiang, representatives from various units pointed out these biases and shortcomings one by one. The commanders and fighters all asked the leading cadres to overcome the work style of being bogged down in routine matters and to spend more time planning, organizing, and leading the production movement.

### 新疆驻军超额完成春耕任务  垦地六十七万亩  修成巨大水利工程

　　新疆驻军超额完成春耕任务
    垦地六十七万亩
    修成巨大水利工程
    【新华社迪化电】人民解放军新疆军区部队已超额完成春耕生产任务。截至五月初止，全军已开地六十七万三千五百亩（超过原计划六十万亩的百分之十二点二）；播种四十三万亩；并修建可灌地百余万亩的巨大水利工程。
    春耕前，军区曾号召全军对军区所规定的生产任务“只能成功，不许失败；只能超过，不能减少”。指战员们以实际的行动回答了上级的号召，他们以战斗的精神克服了一切困难。他们自己制造工具，自己修筑营房和帐篷；不顾天寒地冻，不顾手上打起血泡和脚掌被碱水泡肿（新疆土地碱性大，开垦前须灌水以去掉碱性），热烈地展开了大生产运动。
    连队中的中国共产党支部及全体共产党员，在克服这些困难和保证完成生产任务方面，起了决定的作用。连队的生产计划及生产中的重大问题，首先经过共产党支委会的详细讨论和研究，然后发动和组织全体指战员自觉地去执行。战士们纷纷表示：要在生产中争取立功，争取加入共产党、青年团。某团在春耕期间，有五十六个优秀战士光荣地加入了共产党，有二百十一个青年战士光荣地加入了青年团。
    在祖国边疆的广漠的垦区原野上，到处飘扬着鲜艳的红旗，战士们向着胜利的红旗竞赛前进，愉快的歌声此起彼落。
    各连队的黑板报、广播台都有力地鼓舞着指战员们的生产热情。
    新的生产纪录不断地出现。某连在修渠中，平均每人每天起土十九公方；曾参加过陕北南泥湾大生产运动的某连中国共产党支部书记牛清海，创造了一天开地三亩三分五的最高纪录。
    人民战士的辛勤劳动，在改变着祖国边疆的面貌，同时也改造着自己。
    在生产中，有些单位也存在着一些偏向和缺点。有些部队忽视了科学生产知识与生产技术。某部不会使用洋犁，就说洋犁不好，仍然用砍土镘开地。有的修渠部队忽视了科学技术的指导，以致浪费了不少劳动力。有的领导干部每天把战士带到地里，只对他们说：“挖吧！”有的完全和战士们一样的干活，而放弃了对生产工作的计划、组织与领导。南疆某军召开的生产代表会议上，各部代表一一指出了这些偏向和缺点。指战员们都要求领导干部克服事务主义的作风，用更多的时间去计划、组织和领导生产运动。
