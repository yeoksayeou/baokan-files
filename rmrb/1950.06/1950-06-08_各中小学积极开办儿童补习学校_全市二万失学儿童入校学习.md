[Beijing News Agency Report] Children's remedial schools are developing universally throughout Beijing and are gradually becoming standardized. As of the end of May, 195 children's remedial schools had been established in the urban area, with a total of 771 classes and 21,912 students. There are 2,400 teachers, all teaching on a voluntary basis. The teachers include middle school students, primary school teachers, and a few active members of the community who are capable of teaching. There are also primary school students teaching classes. Detailed statistics for the suburban areas are not yet available, but there are approximately several thousand students.

Most of the children's remedial schools are run by relying on middle and primary schools. Due to the uneven distribution of middle and primary schools in the region, with more schools in the inner city, development is easier. The conditions in the outer city are poor, and teachers and classrooms are problematic, making establishment more difficult. Therefore, there are more children's remedial schools in the inner city than in the outer city. Education for out-of-school children in the suburban areas has not been well developed. In addition to children's remedial schools, some children are still attending classes with adults. Some primary schools are solving the education problem for some out-of-school children by running kindergarten classes.

These children's remedial schools have gradually become standardized. They are designated to have a six-year graduation period, with classes held for 40 weeks each year, six to seven days per week. There are no rigid requirements for winter and summer vacations. The curriculum includes core subjects such as Chinese language, arithmetic, and general knowledge. Primary school textbooks are used for all subjects. Systems for exams, promotions, and transfers are also made as consistent as possible with regular primary schools. Many remedial school students have reached the academic level of regular primary schools. Some students have transferred to regular primary schools, and some have even entered junior high schools.

Currently, there are approximately 80,000 out-of-school children in the city (over 45,000 in the urban area and over 34,000 in the suburban area), with the majority being the children of working people. This year, primary schools are only planning to add 65 classes, which can only accommodate over 3,000 children. Therefore, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education plans to appropriately consolidate and expand existing children's remedial schools under the current conditions, and plans to add 350 classes (approximately 196 in the suburban area, 94 in the outer city, and 60 in the inner city), which can accommodate 14,000 children.

The biggest difficulty facing children's remedial schools is the lack of teachers. The main sources of teachers are primary school teachers and middle school students. Primary school teachers generally feel too busy. Middle school students often arrive late for remedial school classes due to some middle schools emphasizing extracurricular group activities, which affects the children's class time. "Little teachers" (students in primary schools) have solved part of the teacher shortage problem, but they often make mistakes when teaching due to their low cultural and political level. Under these circumstances, on the one hand, the administrations of universities and middle schools and the Communist Youth League organizations should be used to mobilize students with excellent grades and active work to participate. On the other hand, local intellectuals should also be mobilized to teach. Primary school teachers are already relatively busy, but schools should also find ways to allocate some time to take care of them, such as planning school work and organizing little teachers. Regarding the study issue for teachers who are separated from production, political study can be combined with the study of middle and primary school teachers. In terms of professional development, demonstration teaching, forums, and experience reports can be held without hindering work and on a voluntary basis to improve professional skills. In the suburban areas, many cadres of the cultural and educational sections of the districts have been transferred to cooperate with the district's central work (such as land reform and production). Some district cultural and educational sections have a staffing of four or five people on paper, but in reality, only one person is doing education work. Therefore, they cannot take good care of children's remedial schools, and this problem has not been resolved.

　　各中小学积极开办儿童补习学校
    全市二万失学儿童入校学习
    【京市新闻处讯】京市儿童补习学校正普遍地发展，并日渐走向正规化。到五月底为止，城区儿童补习学校已开办了一百九十五处，共七百七十一班，学生二万一千九百十二人。教员二千四百名，全部义务教学。教员中包括有中学生、小学教员和少数能担任教学的居民中的积极分子，也有小学生来教课的。郊区还没有详细的统计数字，学生大约有数千人。
    儿童补习学校大部分是依靠中、小学来办的，由于中小学在地区上分布的不平均，内城学校多，发展较容易，外城条件差，教员和教室都成问题，开办比较困难；所以儿童补习学校也是内城多于外城。郊区失学儿童教育还没有很好的开展，除儿童补习学校之外，有些儿童还是和成人在一起上课。有些小学则用办幼稚班的办法解决了一部失学儿童的教育问题。
    这些儿童补习学校已逐渐走向正规化。规定六年毕业，每年上课四十周，每周上课六天至七天，寒暑假不作硬性规定。课程有国语、算术、常识等主要科目，教科书都采用小学课本。考试、升级、转学等制度也尽可能与一般小学一致。有不少补习学校学生成绩达到了普通小学的水平。有一部分学生已转入正规小学，还有升入初级中学的。
    目前全市失学儿童大约还有八万人（城区四万五千多名，郊区三万四千多名），其中以劳动人民的子弟占多数。今年小学只计划增六十五班，仅能容纳儿童三千多名，故市文教局拟在现有的条件下，适当地整顿和扩充现有的儿童补习学校，并计划增开三百五十班（约郊区一百九十六班，外城九十四班，内城六十班），可容纳儿童一万四千人。
    儿童补习学校最感困难的是教员的缺乏。教员的来源，主要是小学教员和中学生。小学教员一般都感到太忙；中学生则因有些中学强调课外集体活动，到补习学校上课常常迟到，影响儿童上课时间。“小先生”（小学里的学生）解决了一部分教员荒的问题，但因文化政治水平低，讲课时常发生错误。在这种情形下，一方面应通过大、中学行政和团的组织，动员成绩优良工作积极的同学参加；另一方面也应动员地方知识分子来教课。小学教员本来比较忙，但在学校方面也应设法分出一部时间来照顾，如计划学校工作和组织小先生等。关于脱离生产教员的学习问题，政治学习可与中、小教员学习合并进行；业务方面，在不妨碍工作和自愿的原则下可举办示范教学、组织座谈会和经验报告等，以提高业务水平。郊区文教科，为了配合区的中心工作（如土地改革、生产等），干部多被调走，有的区文教科在编制上是四、五个人，实际上却只有一个人作教育工作，因此对儿童补习学校也不可能很好的照顾，这个问题一直没有得到解决。
