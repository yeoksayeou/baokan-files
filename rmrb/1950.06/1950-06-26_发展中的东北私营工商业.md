Developing Private Industry and Commerce in Northeast China
    Huashan
    The support of the state-owned economy and the rapid increase in farmers' purchasing power have opened up broad avenues for the development of private enterprises in Northeast China.

    The number of private industrial enterprises in Shenyang, the capital of Northeast China, has more than doubled since liberation. The number of private enterprises in Harbin, the largest city in North Manchuria, has also exceeded the highest record during the wartime boom.

    Shenyang is a heavy industrial center where the state-owned economic power occupies an overwhelming advantage. Harbin is a processing industrial city developed in a war-torn environment. Each has its own characteristics, and private industry and commerce have experienced a painful journey and have developed rapidly.

    "Hit it fast, grab a handful, get immediate profit." This phrase was once popular in Harbin. Industries that processed for military industry and military supplies, such as ironworks, leather, clothing, and textiles, became upstarts. Small weaving factories increased from 700 in 1946 to 2,000 in 1948. The total number of private enterprises in the city increased more than threefold. In the first five months after the liberation of Shenyang (November 1948 to April 1949), the needs of the southward People's Liberation Army and the restoration of urban and rural transportation also increased the number of private entrepreneurs by 170 percent.

    However, with the beginning of comprehensive peaceful construction and the smooth flow of materials inside and outside the customs, the blindness of this development was fully exposed. More than ten industries in Harbin, which relied on war profiteering, such as ironworks, leather, and leather goods, declined sharply; 4,000 garment and dyeing workers and 8,000 textile workers lost their jobs; and shoddy rubber, paper, dyes, pencils, toothbrushes, caustic soda, etc., were squeezed out of the market. Thousands of enterprises and 30,000 workers were on the verge of closure and unemployment. In Shenyang, the textile industry and other industries also lost their market due to poor quality, and production was intermittent. In particular, high-end consumer goods industries serving bureaucrats, compradors, and landlords collapsed one after another. The number of gold shops, silk and cotton groceries, and fine leather clothing and hat shops alone decreased from 1,455 in May 1949 to 360 in October of the same year. Only commerce related to industrial production, such as iron shops and industrial raw material sales, continued to develop.

    It was precisely during this transitional period of reorganization that the surging farmers' purchasing power poured into the market, which was particularly exciting and made people anxious: Last winter, farmers in Northeast China bought 900,000 bolts of cotton cloth at once, and before April this year, they bought another 900,000 bolts. According to past practice, farmers would withdraw from the market after the spring plowing, but this year, even when it came time for summer hoeing, they continued to demand industrial products: They bought coarse cloth and also wanted fine cloth, printed cloth, and twill cloth, but there were no strong and beautiful goods on the market; they bought handmade "wula" (traditional straw shoes) and also wanted "rubber cotton shoes" and "water shoes", but the existing rubber shoes were not suitable for working in the fields; they bought paper and pens and also wanted to buy foreign socks and "colorful clothes" for women, children, and Yangko dance teams, but the frivolous stocks of silk stockings and other goods on the market did not suit the tastes of farmers. When the market was still anxious about not being able to produce goods suitable for rural needs, spring plowing brought new demands from farmers. Farmers wanted improved farm tools, new farm tools, saddles, whips, reins, harnesses, etc. Even when watering horses, they wanted to buy a foreign iron bucket.

    The new purchasing power was knocking on the door of private capital, but it encountered a series of difficulties when facing the countryside. Take the manufacture of a weeder: it requires ironworkers, carpenters, and different equipment and technologies for manufacturing various machine parts. To reduce costs, it is necessary to manufacture in large quantities. These are not problems that can be solved by the equipment and funds of individual iron factories. At this time, the state-owned economy demonstrated the great role of supporting private capital: only because the state-owned economic organs organized the processing and ordering of 14,000 new agricultural implements, eight agricultural implement factories and twenty-five iron factories in Harbin were able to exert their full productive capacity this spring. The development of these production undertakings also drove the partial production of ninety-two related industries.

    With the development of state-owned enterprises, the form of public-private cooperation in processing and ordering pointed out another prospect for the development of private capital.

    The total value of processing fees for the machinery and iron industry in Shenyang. Only in the first quarter of this year did it exceed 7 billion yuan for the entire year, and the total value of orders reached 461 percent of the entire year last year (28.3 billion yuan).

    Private dyeing and weaving factories, which had shrunk due to poor quality, also began to embark on the road of normal development under the same assistance. From January to May this year, private dyeing and weaving industries in Northeast China accepted 229,000 bolts of weaving processing and nearly 310,000 bolts of dyeing processing from the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company, earning a total of more than 250 billion yuan in processing fees. The number of dyeing and weaving factories in Shenyang that received processing commissions increased from 33 to 481, and the machines involved accounted for 43 percent of the city's knitting machines (614 units) and 80 percent of the weaving machines (2,128 units), with more than 7,500 workers. In Harbin, the output of the forty motor-powered weaving factories that received processing commissions accounted for 60 percent of the city's total private weaving output. In particular, because they accepted the suggestions of state-owned companies and began to improve their management methods, the processing profit, which was only enough to maintain expenses last year, has now increased to a net profit of 30,000 yuan per bolt of cloth. The loss rate of two dyeing factories has also been reduced from 10 percent to 1 percent, which greatly reduced costs. A weaving factory in Shenyang that was on the verge of shutting down developed more than 20 power looms in more than two months and added more than 3,000 bolts of cotton cloth. A small knitting factory with only four machines and six workers has now increased to fifteen machines and more than fifty workers. This factory has also shifted from the intermittent state of "grabbing a handful" to regular two-shift production.

    Some industries that are not necessary for the national economy and the people's livelihood have begun to switch to other industries in the face of market tests. In Shenyang, 544 private industrial and commercial enterprises have directly switched to other industries in the past year. Among them, gold shops have switched to operating rubber industry and electric saw material industry, and silk and cotton groceries have switched to operating cotton industry. Forty-nine superstitious goods businesses in Harbin have seen a resurgence in business by switching to operating color paper needed for rural cultural life and account books and packaging paper needed for industry and commerce.

    After a series of transformations, the number of private enterprises in Harbin has developed to 24,957, which is 2,375 more than the highest record during the wartime boom. The main industry, iron industry, has developed from 220 to 479. The number of private enterprises in Shenyang has increased from 17,580 at the time of liberation to 30,043 in April this year. In the past year and a half, the development of private industry has been particularly significant: the number of factories has increased from 6,546 to 13,459 (that is, an increase of 205 percent); the number of employees has increased from 26,008 to 56,328 (216 percent); and the capital has increased by 240 percent from April last year to April this year alone.

    In addition to helping solve the difficulties of raw materials and funds by means of "processing" and "ordering", state-owned enterprises also helped private products find markets through "consignment sales". In Shenyang alone, the products sold to various parts of Northeast China through the state-owned trade network in the first four months of this year reached 106.25 billion yuan, which is more than one and a half times the total value of consignment sales for the entire year last year. More than 1,000 products in Harbin have also been widely distributed to rural areas with the help of state-owned department stores. Even so, industrial products still lag far behind the needs of farmers. According to a rough calculation, farmers in Songjiang Province require more than 200 kinds of living materials and production materials, but Harbin City can only supply less than 30 kinds. And Songjiang was still a province that suffered from drought last year. Last autumn, it was generally estimated that farmers in the province had at most 80,000 tons of surplus grain. However, as soon as industrial products worth 80,000 tons were invested last winter, farmers immediately took out another "80,000 tons"; after investing another "80,000 tons", another "80,000 tons" of demand emerged; ... By April this year, farmers in Songjiang had bought 320,000 tons of grain's worth of industrial products, and now there are still more than 60,000 tons of surplus grain waiting to be exchanged for industrial products.

    Sixty thousand tons! Enough for the entire population of Shanghai to eat for twenty days. And this year's autumn harvest will soon bring 4 million tons of surplus grain to farmers in Northeast China. In addition to rural by-products equivalent to 2 million tons of grain, such a large purchasing power is indeed enough for state-owned enterprises and private enterprises to work together to cope with. And the workers' purchasing power in the cities, which is equivalent to 3.2 million tons of grain this year, is still waiting.

    "Combine with the state-owned economy, face the people, especially the farmers." This is the direction that the private industrial and commercial circles in Northeast China are striving for at present, and it can also be said to be the direction that the private industrial and commercial circles across the country are striving for. The development of private industry and commerce in Northeast China today is only a good start. How to more organizedly and more planned combine with the national economy, divide labor and cooperate, improve management, and increase products requires every ambitious industrialist and businessman to work harder.

　　发展中的东北私营工商业
    华山
    国营经济的扶助和农民购买力的迅速提高，给东北私营企业开辟了广阔的发展道路。
    东北首府沈阳的私营工业，解放以来增加一倍以上。北满最大城市哈尔滨的私营企业，也超过了战时繁荣时期的最高纪录。
    沈阳是国家经济力量占压倒优势的重工业中心，哈尔滨是在战争分割环境中发展起来的加工工业城市。它们各有特点，私营工商业在经历了一段痛苦路程后都同样得到了迅速发展。
    “打快锤，抓一把，现得利。”这句话在哈尔滨曾经流行一时。为军事工业和军需工业加工的行业如铁工、皮革、被服、纺织等成了暴发户，小型织布厂从一九四六年的七百家增至一九四八年的二千家，全市私营企业总数突增三倍以上。沈阳解放后的最初五个月（四八年十一月到四九年四月），南下大军的需要和城乡交通的恢复也使得私营企业家数增至百分之一百七十。
    可是，随着全面和平建设的开始和关内外物资的畅流，此种发展的盲目性就充分暴露出来了。靠战争暴发的哈尔滨铁工、皮革、皮具等十余个行业顿形衰退；四千被服染织工人和八千纺织工人失业；粗制滥造的橡胶、造纸、染料、铅笔、牙刷、火碱等被挤出市场；数千家企业和三万工人濒于歇业失业危险。在沈阳，纺织业等也因质量不佳而失去市场，时做时停；特别是为官僚、买办、地主服务的高级消费品行业纷纷倒闭，仅金店、丝棉杂货、细皮衣帽等三类即由一九四九年五月的一千四百五十五家减至同年十月的三百六十家。只有与工业生产有关的商业如铁店业、工业原料贩卖业等仍在继续发展。
    正是在这重行改组的过渡时期，汹涌投入市场的农民购买力特别令人兴奋，也特别叫人着急：去年冬天东北农民一下了买了九十万匹棉布，今年四月以前又买了九十万匹；历年惯例，开春以后农民即退出市场，可是今年到了夏锄的时候依然不断要求工业品：买了粗布还要买细布、花布、斜纹布，但市场上却没有结实美观的货色；买了手工做的乌拉还要买“橡胶棉鞋”和“水鞋”，现有的胶鞋却不适合于下地耕作；买了纸笔还要给妇女、小孩和秧歌队买洋袜子和“花花衣裳”，但市场上丝袜子之类的虚华存货却不合农民口胃。当市场上还在着急拿不出适于农村需要的货色的时候，春耕又带来农民的新要求了。农民们要改良农具，要新农具，要鞍、鞭、缰、套，……连饮马也要买个洋铁吊桶。
    新的购买力敲着私人资本的大门，可是面向农村却碰到了一连串的困难。就说一台除草机的制造吧：又是铁工，又是木工，各部分机件的制造都要有不同的设备和技术，要想降低成本还得大批制造。这些都不是单个铁工厂的设备和资金所能解决的。国营经济这时候就更表现了扶助私人资本的巨大作用：仅仅是由于国营经济机关组织了一万四千台新农具的加工订货，哈尔滨今春就有八个农具工厂和二十五个铁工厂得以发挥全部生产力。这些生产事业的发展并且还带动了九十二家有关行业的部分生产。
    随着国营企业的发展，加工订货的公私合作形式给私人资本指出了另一个发展前途。
    沈阳机械铁工业的加工费总值。只今年第一季即超过去年全年的七十亿元，定货总值则达去年全年百分之四百六十一（二百八十三亿元）。
    因质量低劣而萎缩的私营染织厂，在同样的扶助下也开始走上正常发展的道路。从今年一月到五月，全东北私营染织业从国营花纱布公司接受了织布加工二十二万九千匹，染色加工近三十一万匹，共得加工费二千五百余亿元。沈阳市获得加工委托的染织厂由三十三户增至四八一户，参加的机器占全市的针织机百分之四十三（六一四台），占织布机百分之八十（二一二八台），工人达七千五百余人。在哈尔滨，获得加工委托的四十家电机织布厂，生产量达全市私营织布总量百分之六十。特别是由于他们接受了国营公司的建议，开始改善了经营方法，去年仅够维持开支的加工利润现已增加到每匹布纯利三万元。两家染厂的损耗率也由百分之十减到百分之一，因而使成本大大降低了。沈阳一家濒于停工的织布厂，两个多月中发展了二十余台电力机，加织棉布三千余匹。一家只有四台机器和六个工人的小针织厂，现已增加到十五台机器和五十余个工人，这个工厂并且由“抓一把”的时冷时热的状态转入两班制的正规生产。
    不为国计民生所必需的行业，在市场考验面前已有部分开始转业。沈阳全市私营工商业一年来直接转业的有五百四十四家。其中有金店转营橡胶业和电锯材料业，丝棉杂货业转营制棉业等。哈尔滨四十九家迷信品业由于改营农村文化生活需要的彩色纸张和工商业需要的账本、包装用纸等，营业转旺。
    经过了一番改造以后，哈尔滨的私营企业数目已发展到二万四千九百五十七家，比战时繁荣的最高纪录多出二千三百七十五家。主要行业铁工业由二百二十家发展到四百七十九家。沈阳私营企业则由解放时的一万七千五百八十家增至今年四月的三万零四十三家。在这一年半中，私营工业的发展尤为显著：工厂由六千五百四十六家增加到一万三千四百五十九家（即增至百分之二○五）；职工由二万六千零八人，增加到五万六千三百二十八人（百分之二一六）；资金仅从去年四月到今年四月，即增加到百分之二百四十。
    除了以“加工”、“订货”的办法帮助解决原料资金困难以外，国营企业又以“代销”的方式帮助私营产品寻找市场。仅仅沈阳一地，经过国营贸易网销售到东北各地的产品，今年头四个月即达一万零六百二十五亿元，等于去年全年代销总值的一倍半以上。哈尔滨一千余家的产品，也在国营百货公司帮助下广泛深入农村。即使这样，工业品仍然远赶不上农民的要求。根据一个粗略的计算，松江省农民要求的生活资料和生产资料达二百余种，哈尔滨市能够供给的却不足三十种。而松江去年还是遭受旱灾的省份。去秋一般估计，全省农民顶多有八万吨余粮。可是去冬刚刚投入价值八万吨的工业品，农民马上又拿出另一个“八万吨”；再投入“八万吨”，又冒出再一个“八万吨”的需要；……到今年四月，松江农民已买了三十二万吨粮的工业品，现在还有六万吨以上的余粮等待换回工业品。
    六万吨！够上海全市人口吃二十天的。而今年秋收，马上又要给东北农民带来四百万吨余粮了。再加上相当于二百万吨粮的农村副产品，这样大的购买力，的确够国营企业和私营企业共同努力应付的。而今年等于三百二十万吨粮食的工人购买力还在城市里等待着。
    “结合国营经济，面向人民特别是面向农民。”这是目前东北私营工商业界努力的方向，也可以说是全国私营工商业界努力的方向，今天东北私营工商业的发展只是一个良好的开端。如何更有组织地和更有计划地与国家经济结合起来，分工合作，改善经营，增加产品，都有待每一个有事业心的工商业者加倍努力。
