　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 19th: The Chinese Communist Party member cadres of various agencies at the Northwest Administrative Region level officially began the rectification campaign on the 15th. This is the starting point for the large-scale campaign to rectify the work style of cadres throughout the Northwest region. The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a conference of over a thousand Party member cadres on the 14th to mobilize for the rectification campaign. Jia Tuofu, a member of the Northwest Bureau, reported on the significance of the rectification, the main targets, objectives, methods, and steps of the rectification.

　　The General Study Committee of the Northwest Region Agencies and the Directly Subordinate Party Committee of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, based on the instructions issued by the Northwest Bureau on May 30 regarding the rectification of cadres' work style, have formulated specific plans. The plan stipulates that the steps for this rectification study should begin with the leading organs. Leading cadres should come before general cadres, and veteran cadres before new cadres. On the basis of studying documents, connecting with reality, combining top and bottom, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, a general survey and key inspections should be conducted on the current existing problems according to the principles of voluntariness and problem-solving. The plan determines that from June 15, the rectification movement will proceed in three stages: The first stage mainly involves in-depth mobilization, eliminating concerns, reading designated documents, brewing opinions, conducting informal discussions, and raising questions. The second stage directly enters the work inspection phase. Leading cadres should, based on the questions raised by everyone, make a comprehensive report on the work of their departments, analyze their main shortcomings and ideological style problems in their work, and organize everyone to conduct heated discussions and debates. At the same time, everyone should combine document study to analyze the existing problems in their work and seek a unified understanding. During discussions, not only should shortcomings and errors be pointed out, but also strengths and achievements should be pointed out, and criticism and praise should be given to determine the correct ideological style and working methods. The third stage is to read the designated documents more deeply, focusing on the CPC Central Committee's decision on leadership methods, discuss specific opinions on improving the work of the department, and write a written conclusion. All cadres participating in the study should write their own ideological summaries based on the results of the review, to achieve the purpose of generally improving the theoretical level and improving work.

　　In order to strengthen the leadership of the rectification movement, the General Study Committee of the Northwest Region Agencies has been expanded on the existing basis and has organized specialized departments responsible for understanding the situation, exchanging experiences, studying problems, and promoting study. It has now begun operations. The sub-General Study Committees of major agencies have also assigned full-time personnel to carry out the daily work of rectification study.

　　In addition: The Party committees of Gansu and Ningxia provinces made rectification plans at the end of May, which have been reviewed by the Northwest Bureau and opinions have been put forward, and they are preparing to modify them before implementation. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC convened the provincial committee at the beginning of this month to discuss and revise the original rectification plan, which has begun on the 15th.

　　西北区开始整风
    总学委会扩大组织  作出整风具体计划
    【新华社西安十九日电】西北大行政区一级各机关中国共产党的党员干部，已于十五日正式开始整风。这是此次西北全区大规模整顿干部作风运动的起点。中共中央西北局于十四日召开了千余人的党员干部大会，进行整风动员，由西北局委员贾拓夫报告了整风意义，整风的主要对象、目的、方法和步骤。
    西北区机关总学委会及中共中央西北局直属党委，根据西北局五月三十日发布的关于整顿干部作风的指示，已作出具体计划。该计划规定：此次整风学习的步骤，首先应从领导机关着手。领导干部先于一般干部，老干部先于新干部。在学习文件、联系实际、上下结合、开展批评和自我批评的基础上，根据自觉自愿、解决问题的原则，就当前存在的问题进行普查和重点检查。该计划确定自六月十五日起，整风运动分三个阶段按步进行：第一阶段，主要是深入动员，消除顾虑，阅读指定文件，酝酿意见，进行漫谈，提出问题。第二阶段即直接进入工作检查。由领导干部根据大家所提问题，作出本部门工作的全面情况的报告，分析自己在工作中主要缺点和思想作风问题，组织大家热烈讨论和争论；同时，大家结合文件学习，分析工作中存在的问题，求得一致的认识。在讨论时，不仅要指出缺点与错误，同时也指出优点与成绩，予以批评和表扬，以确定正确的思想作风和工作方法。第三阶段是更深入地阅读指定文件，以中共中央关于领导方法的决定为主，讨论改进本部门工作的具体意见，写成书面结论。所有参加学习的干部，应根据检讨结果，分别写出自己的思想总结，达到普遍提高理论水平和改进工作的目的。
    为了加强对整风运动的领导，西北区机关总学委已在现有基础上加以扩大，并组织了专门部门，负责了解情况，交流经验，研究问题，推动学习，现已开始办公。各大机关的分总学委会亦抽出专人，进行整风学习的日常工作。
    又：中共甘肃、宁夏两省党委，已于五月底作出整风计划，经西北局审查并提出意见，准备加以修改后开始执行。中共陕西省委于本月初召集省委会，对原来整风计划加以讨论修改后，已于十五日开始进行。
