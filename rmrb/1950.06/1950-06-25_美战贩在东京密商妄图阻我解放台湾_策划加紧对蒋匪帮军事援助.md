Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, and MacArthur held secret talks in Tokyo, plotting not only to turn Japan into a permanent U.S. military base for aggression but also to intensify aid to the dying Kuomintang remnants in their final struggle, attempting to obstruct the Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan.

During Johnson and Bradley's secret meetings with MacArthur and his senior officials from the 18th to the 20th, the Taiwan issue was discussed. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo, senior officials at MacArthur's headquarters reported to Johnson on the 18th regarding the Far East military situation, stating that the situation in Taiwan was "extremely serious" and that the liberation of Taiwan would "severely threaten" the U.S.'s line of aggression in the Far East. They advocated: "American equipment is now needed to save Taiwan. This equipment should be shipped quickly for the Kuomintang to use, supervised by a U.S. military delegation, just as in Greece." On the 19th, Johnson and others held direct secret talks with MacArthur for three hours. The Associated Press stated: "It is reported that MacArthur emphasized that the U.S.'s position in Asia is very serious... He urged the United States to provide immediate material assistance to Taiwan and Southeast Asia." On the morning of the 20th, Johnson met with the acting commander of the U.S. Far East Air Force, Partridge, to hear "the Air Force's assessment of the strategic value of Taiwan." Partridge also emphasized Taiwan's strategic importance to U.S. aggression in the Far East and advocated that the U.S. obstruct the Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan.

According to a United Press reporter in Tokyo on the 20th, Johnson and Bradley will propose to Truman the suggestion of supporting the Kuomintang remnants to obstruct the liberation of Taiwan after returning home.

　　美战贩在东京密商妄图阻我解放台湾
    策划加紧对蒋匪帮军事援助
    【新华社二十四日讯】美国国防部长詹逊、参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷与麦克阿瑟在东京所进行的秘密会商，除企图将日本变为美国永久性的军事侵略基地以外，另一阴谋是设法加紧援助已临末日的国民党残匪进行最后挣扎，妄图阻挠中国人民解放军解放台湾。
    詹逊与布莱德雷在十八日至二十日与麦克阿瑟及其高级官员的秘密会谈中，均商讨了台湾问题。据美联社东京消息透露：麦克阿瑟总部高级官员十八日在汇报远东军事情况时告詹逊说，台湾的情势“极端严重”，台湾的解放将使美国的远东侵略线“受到严重威胁”。他们主张：“现在需要美国装备来挽救台湾，这些装备应当迅速启运供国民党使用，由美国军事代表团加以监督，正如同对希腊监督的那样”。十九日，詹逊等与麦克阿瑟直接秘密会谈三小时。美联社称：“据悉，麦克阿瑟曾强调美国在亚洲的地位非常严重，……他敦促美国对台湾和东南亚立即给予物资援助。”二十日上午，詹逊与美国远东空军代理司令柏特利基会谈，听取“空军方面对于台湾战略价值的估计”。柏特利基亦强调台湾对美国侵略远东的战略重要性，并主张美国阻挠中国人民解放台湾。
    据合众社东京记者二十日称：詹逊与布莱德雷回国以后，将向杜鲁门提出支持国民党残匪阻挠台湾解放的建议。
