　　Jiangxi State-Owned Mines
    Tungsten, Tin, and Coal Production Exceeds Targets
    Pingxiang Coal Mine Produces 20,000 Tons of Coal in One Month
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 12th] The Jiangxi Provincial Branch of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee Nonferrous Metals Administration Bureau (formerly the Jiangxi Tungsten and Tin Company) and the Pingxiang Mining Bureau under the Coal Mining Administration have exceeded their production targets for May. Tungsten ore exceeded the original plan by 2.2%, tin exceeded by 39.8%, and coal exceeded by 7.4%.
    [Report from Pingxiang] In the "Red May" great production competition, the Pingxiang Coal Mine produced 20,889 tons of coal for the entire month, successfully exceeding its target. At the same time, the quality of coal has also improved. The raw coal to clean coal conversion rate has increased from an average of 60% in December 1948 to 79%, and the ash content has decreased from over 25% to below 22%. The cost per ton of coal has decreased from 300-400 jin of rice to over 200 jin. In December 1948, Pingxiang Mine had a total of 6,054 workers, with a monthly coal output of 13,289 tons. This May, with only 3,596 workers, the monthly output increased to 20,889 tons. The reason is that since March of this year, the mine has established a series of safety regulations and strengthened underground safety equipment. However, safety education has not yet deeply penetrated the masses, resulting in production costs still being far from reasonable. To consolidate the above production achievements, an anti-waste movement and inventory check are underway, and quota work is being done to further increase production.

　　江西国营矿山
    钨锡煤生产超过任务
    萍乡煤矿全月产煤两万吨
    【新华社南昌十二日电】中南军政委员会有色金属管理局江西省分局（即原江西钨锡公司）和煤矿管理局萍乡矿务局，五月份已超额完成生产任务。计钨砂超过原计划百分之二点二，锡超过百分之三十九点八。煤超过百分之七点四。
    【本报萍乡讯】萍乡煤矿在红五月大生产竞赛中，全月产煤二万零八百八十九吨，胜利超过洗务；同时煤质亦见提高，毛煤任净折合率已由一九四八年十二月平均百分之六十增至百分之七十九，灰分亦由百分之二十五以上降至百分之二十二以下。每吨煤的成本则由三、四百斤大米降为二百余斤。一九四八年十二月，萍矿共有工人六千零五十四人，月产煤一万三千二百八十九吨；今年五月仅有工人三千五百九十六人，月产量即增为二万零八百八十九吨。原因是该矿自今年三月以来，建立了一系列的保安制度，加强了井下安全设备。但安全教育还没有深入群众，致生产成本距合理成本还远。为巩固以上生产成绩，现正结合反浪费运动、清查仓库物资，做好定额工作，把生产继续提高一步。
