    Sujiatun Grinding Wheel Factory
    Corundum Production Increases Eightfold
    [This Dispatch from Shenyang] Zhao Guanghe, an advanced production worker at the Sujiatun Grinding Wheel Factory in Shenyang, has further researched and improved operational techniques, increasing corundum production eightfold while simultaneously improving quality.
    Since Zhao Guanghe successfully trial-produced corundum at the factory, the initial maximum output per furnace was only 55 kilograms due to equipment limitations, and the quality was very low. Zhao Guanghe united with other workers in the factory to jointly research and improve technology. At the end of April this year, large furnaces were used for smelting, increasing the output to 133 jin, but the quality was still not good enough. Everyone continued to research and identify the fundamental reason for this shortcoming: the electrode resistance rod was too thin, and the heat was not high enough to fully melt the raw materials. After modifying the electrode rod, the output of the second trial smelting increased to 282 jin. Then, they theoretically discovered that the reason for the poor quality was that the energizing time in the past was insufficient, and the standard time should be 30-40 hours. When smelting on May 8th, the energizing time was extended to more than 30 hours, but the energizing was stopped after 27 hours and 55 minutes due to the small transformer. Although the time was not long enough, the output and quality had been greatly improved. This furnace produced 450 kilograms of corundum, including 300 kilograms of Grade 1 sand and 150 kilograms of Grade 2 sand, an eightfold increase in output compared to the past. It is estimated that the output can be further increased after replacing it with a large transformer. From then on, the raw material problem that the grinding wheel factory had been unable to solve for a long time could be easily solved.
    In addition: The factory's research on improving the quality of abrasive cloth has also been successful. The long-suspended production of abrasive cloth has now been officially resumed. The abrasive cloth produced by the factory does not lose sand or flake, and the quality of the products has exceeded that of Shanghai's products.

    苏家屯砂轮厂
    金钢砂产量提高八倍
    【本报沈阳讯】沈阳苏家屯砂轮厂先进生产工作者赵广和，经过进一步研究，改进了操作技术，使金钢砂的产量增加八倍，质量亦同时提高。
    该厂自赵广和试制金钢砂成功后，当初因受设备限制，每炉最高产量仅为五十五公斤，且质量很低。赵广和团结该厂其他职工，共同研究改进技术。于今年四月底，改用大炉炼制，产量升至一百三十三斤，但质量还不够好。大家又继续研究，找出这种缺点的基本原因，是电极抵抗棒太细，热量不高，不能使原料充分熔解。改造电极棒后，第二炉试炼时，产量即增至二百八十二斤。接着又从理论上发现了质量不好的原因，是过去送电的时间不够，依照标准时间应该是三十——四十小时。五月八日炼制时，延长送电时间到三十小时以上，但因变压器太小，炼到二十七时五十五分就停止送电了。虽然时间还不够长，产量和质量却已大大提高。该炉计出金钢砂四百五十公斤，其中一级砂三百公斤，二级砂一百五十公斤，产量比从前增加了八倍。估计换成大变压器以后，产量还可提高。从此砂轮厂长期所不能解决的原料问题，即可迎刃而解。
    又：该厂改进砂布质量的研究，亦告成功。停止已久的砂布生产，现已正式恢复。该厂所出砂布不掉砂，不起片，产品的质量已超过上海的出品。
