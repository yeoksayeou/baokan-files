The Western Hebei Sand Land Afforestation Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government launched a large-scale spring afforestation campaign in March of this year in eight key sand land afforestation counties in western Hebei Province, including Quyang, Tangxian, Zhengding, Xinle, Wuji, Gaocheng, Lingshou, and Dingxian. Over 100,290 farmers enthusiastically participated. A total of 2,200,370 windbreak and sand-fixation trees were planted; 3,265,300 flood-prevention trees were planted; 2,360,400 general trees were planted; and 143,200 trees were planted in public-private cooperative forest farms directly invested in by the Afforestation Bureau, for a total of 7,972,600 trees planted, basically completing the massive task of planting an estimated eight million trees. This is more than double the 2.75 million trees planted in the spring of the previous year when the Afforestation Bureau was first established in seven counties (excluding Lingshou), and it eliminated over 63,200 mu of riverside sand and dry sand. Among them, Tangxian and Xinle counties, with larger organizational strength, both achieved the significant result of planting over 1.7 million trees. Other counties also exceeded or basically completed their plans.

The emergence of these achievements is mainly due to the following reasons:

First, the attention and in-depth, specific leadership of governments at all levels. At the beginning of this spring's afforestation, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and the Afforestation Bureau all held forestry conferences to uniformly formulate the annual three-season afforestation plan. The Afforestation Bureau also held a half-month forestry training class. The Shijiazhuang and Dingxian Special Administrative Offices and the leading organs of each county all listed afforestation for disaster prevention and transforming sand land as one of the measures for increasing agricultural production. They discussed it through representatives' conferences, made resolutions, and used various methods to widely carry out propaganda and mobilization for afforestation and forest protection. The county heads of Tangxian and Quyang personally wrote letters to afforestation models in various villages, encouraging them to lead the masses in planting trees on a large scale. The Afforestation Bureau and agricultural and forestry cadres from the special administrative regions and counties organized work teams, absorbed local tree-planting experts to participate, and went deep into key districts and villages to comprehensively mobilize tree planting and afforestation.

Second, land certificates were issued, property rights were determined, tree planting was rewarded, and forest protection covenants were established. For example, in Xisunjialou Village, Tangxian, after a forest protection covenant was democratically established, the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation soared. They immediately sent people to Lingshou to buy more than 30 large cartloads of poplar seedlings and planted more than 40,000 trees. Zu Erlai, a labor model from Beigaoli, Tangxian, sold piglets to buy tree seedlings, leading the whole village to plant more than 36,000 trees.

Third, cooperative afforestation was carried out. After patient propaganda and deliberation by cadres in Gaoling Village, Wuji, and through the demonstration of activists such as Guo Logong, the whole village was led to carry out small-scale cooperative afforestation of more than 16,000 trees. The afforestation cooperatives organized last year in key villages in Tangxian, Zhengding, Xinle, and other counties continued afforestation this spring, expanding the area of ​​barren land being reclaimed. The Lao Zi River and Dong Changshou cooperative farms, invested in by the Western Hebei Sand Land Afforestation Bureau with tree seedlings, also expanded their organization and established windbreak forest belts and forest networks of 1,475 mu on both sides of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Due to the development of cooperative afforestation, organized forest protection belts were established, and private tree planting was universally promoted.

　　冀西八个沙荒造林重点县
    十万余农民参加春季造林
    植树八百万株灭荒六万亩
    【本报讯】中央人民政府林垦部冀西沙荒造林局，于今年三月间，在河北省西部的曲阳、行唐、正定、新乐、无极、藁城、灵寿、定县等八个沙荒造林重点县，发动了大规模的春季造林运动，有十万零二千九百余农民热烈参加。计完成防风、防沙林二百二十万零三千七百株；防洪林三百二十六万五千三百株；一般植树二百三十六万零四百株；加上造林局直接投资的公私合作林场造林十四万三千二百株，共计造林植树七百九十七万二千六百株，基本上完成了预计八百万株的巨大任务。较去年春季造林局刚成立时的七县（灵寿除外）造林二百七十五万株的成绩，超过两倍多，消灭了沿河沙滩和干燥沙滩六万三千二百余亩。其中行唐、新乐两县组织力量较大，均做出了种植一百七十多万株的巨大成绩。其他各县，亦超过或基本上完成了计划。
    以上这些成绩的出现，主要有以下几个原因：
    首先是各级政府的重视与深入具体领导。今春造林开始时，林垦部、河北省人民政府与造林局均召开了林业会议，统一制定了全年三季造林计划。造林局并举办为期半月的林业训练班。石家庄与定县两专署及各县领导机关，均把造林防灾、改造沙荒，列为农业增产措施之一，通过各界代表会讨论，作出决议，利用各种方式，广泛进行造林、护林的宣传动员。行唐、曲阳两县长并亲自写信给各村造林模范，鼓励他们带动群众广泛植树造林。造林局与专县农林干部，组织工作组，吸收当地植树能手参加，深入重点区村，全面发动植树造林。
    其次是颂发土地证，确定产权，奖励植树，并订立了护林公约。如行唐西孙家楼村，经过民主订立护林公约后，群众造林情绪高涨，随即派人到灵寿买青杨树秧三十多大车，植树四万余株。行唐北高里劳动模范祖二来卖了小猪换树秧，带动全村造林三万六千多株。
    第三是开展合作造林。无极高陵村经过干部耐心宣传酝酿，并通过积极分子郭洛公等的示范，带动全村小型合作造林一万六千余株。行唐、正定、新乐等县各重点村去年组织的造林合作社，今春均继续造林，扩大灭荒面积。冀西沙荒造林局以树秧投资的老滋河、东长寿两大合作农场，并扩大组织，在京汉路两侧建立防风林带林网一千四百七十五亩。由于合作造林的开展，有组织的建立了护林带，又普遍的带动了私人植树。
