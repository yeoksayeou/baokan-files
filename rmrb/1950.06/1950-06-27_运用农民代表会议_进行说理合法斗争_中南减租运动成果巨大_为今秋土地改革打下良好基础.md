Xinhua News Agency, Hankou Electric Dispatch: The rent reduction movement launched in rural areas of various provinces in the Central and South China region this spring has largely concluded by the end of May. The scale of the movement is unprecedented. According to statistics, 80% of the rural areas in the entire region, excluding Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, have carried out rent reduction based on the rent reduction decrees of the People's Government. Some rural areas in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have also reduced rents. During the rent reduction, farmers recovered a total of 886 million jin of grain that should have been reduced according to the decrees. Farmers' associations have grown to more than 13.5 million people. This has not only enabled the vast number of farmers in various provinces of the Central and South China region to overcome the severe spring famine, but also laid the foundation for the implementation of land reform in these areas in the future.

This rent reduction movement in the Central and South China region was not only large in scale, but also carried out under leadership, with policies and in an orderly manner. This is because: 1. County, district, and township farmers' representative conferences were generally convened in various provinces, and rent reduction work was carried out through the farmers' representative conferences; 2. Farmers generally adopted rational and lawful forms of struggle against landlords who violated the law.

In this rent reduction movement in the Central and South China region, the farmers' representative conferences played a huge role. Various provinces fully utilized the farmers' representative conferences in the movement, raising its role from publicizing policies and connecting with the masses to organizing and mobilizing the masses. Once farmers' representative conferences were convened in various places, the movement quickly unfolded. For example, in the Huangchuan Special District of Henan Province, in the ten days from late March to early April, the rent reduction and anti-local tyrant movement in the entire special district developed rapidly due to the full utilization of the farmers' representative conferences, and the number of farmers involved in the movement increased from one million to more than two million. In Hunan Province, various levels of farmers' representative conferences were convened more than 1,500 times during the rent reduction movement. In the six special districts of Changsha, Shaoyang, etc., the rent reduction movement was launched in one-third to one-half of the regions in less than half a month after the farmers' representative conferences were convened. The method of convening joint village farmers' representative conferences adopted in various parts of Hubei Province was even more effective. For example, after the joint village farmers' representative conference was convened in Wuchang County's Wulijie and other districts, the rent reduction movement was launched in dozens of villages in a very short period of time.

The rational and lawful method of struggle fully mobilized the vast number of farmers and ensured that the movement proceeded in an orderly manner. Under the farmers' rational and well-founded struggles, the landlords were speechless and had to reduce rents according to the law, and the landlords' prestige was completely defeated. The illegal acts of a few landlords who stubbornly resisted rent reduction and spread rumors and sabotage were punished by the people's courts according to the law.

This rent reduction movement in the Central and South China region has directly promoted agricultural production this year. In areas where rent reduction has been successful, not only have many difficulties in farmers' lives and seeds been resolved during the spring famine, but many farmers have also used the fruits of rent reduction to purchase many farm tools and plowing cattle. Therefore, the enthusiasm for production among farmers in various parts of the Central and South China region has greatly increased. In addition to planting all the original cultivated land this summer, farmers in many areas have also reclaimed a lot of wasteland. According to statistics from the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, and Guangxi alone, 930,000 mu of new wasteland have been reclaimed this year.

Through this rent reduction movement, the awareness of farmers in various places has been raised, and the number of farmers participating in farmers' associations throughout the region has reached 13.5 million. At the same time, rural political power has also been partially transformed, and feudal evil forces in rural areas have been severely hit. All of these have laid the foundation for the implementation of land reform in the Central and South China region this autumn.

### 运用农民代表会议·进行说理合法斗争  中南减租运动成果巨大  为今秋土地改革打下良好基础

　　运用农民代表会议·进行说理合法斗争
    中南减租运动成果巨大
    为今秋土地改革打下良好基础
    【新华社汉口电】中南区各省农村今春展开的减租运动，已于五月底大体告一段落。运动的规模是空前的。据统计，全区除粤、桂两省外，已有百分之八十的农村，都依据人民政府的减租法令进行了减租。粤、桂两省亦有部分农村减了租。在减租中，农民共收回按法令应减的租粮八亿八千六百万斤，农民协会发展到一千三百五十余万人。这样，不仅使中南区各省广大农民度过严重的春荒，并为今后在这些地区实行土地改革打下了基础。
    中南区这一次减租运动，不仅规模宏大，而且是在有领导、有政策和有秩序的情况下进行的。这是因为：一、各省较普遍地召开了县、区、乡的农民代表会议，通过了农代会进行减租工作；二、农民对违法地主的斗争普遍采用了说理合法的斗争形式。
    在中南区这次的减租运动中，农代会起了极大的作用。各省在运动中都充分地运用了农民代表会议，使它的作用由宣传政策联系群众，进一步提高到组织与发动群众。各地一经召开农代会，运动就迅速的开展起来。如河南省潢川专区，在三月下旬到四月初的十几天内，由于充分运用了农代会，全专区的减租反恶霸运动即迅速发展，卷入运动的农民从一百万增至二百万以上。湖南全省在减租运动中召开各级农代会在一千五百次以上。长沙、邵阳等六个专区，召开农代会后不足半月，便在三分之一到二分之一的地区展开了减租运动。湖北省各地采取召开联村农代会的办法，成绩更是显著。如武昌县属五里界等区召开联村农代会后，很短时间就在几十个村展开了减租运动。
    说理合法的斗争方式，使广大农民充分发动起来，并保证了运动有秩序地进行。在农民有理有据的说理斗争下，地主理屈辞穷，不得不依法减租，地主威风被彻底打垮。少数地主顽抗不减和造谣破坏的不法行为，受到了人民法庭的依法制裁。
    中南区这次减租运动，对于今年的农业生产起了直接的推动作用。凡减租有成绩的地区，不仅解决了农民在春荒中生活和种籽的很多困难，许多农民还利用减租果实，添置了许多农具、耕牛。因此，中南区各地农民生产情绪大大提高，今年夏耕除原有耕地全部播种以外，不少地区农民还开垦了许多荒地。仅湘、鄂、赣、豫、桂五省统计，今年新开荒地即达九十三万亩。
    经过这次减租运动，各地农民的觉悟都提高了，全区参加农民协会的农民已达一千三百五十万人。同时，农村政权亦部分获得改造，农村中封建恶势力受到严重打击。这些，都为中南区今秋实行土地改革打下了基础。
