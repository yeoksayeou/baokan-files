　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th: Tokyo news, Akahata newspaper published the Japanese Communist Party's call to all Japanese patriots on the 6th, which reads in essence:
　　The Yoshida Cabinet's brutal suppression of expelling all members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party is a clear violation of the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's Sixteen Principles. This clearly proves that international reactionary forces have suffered a crushing defeat worldwide, and especially in Asia, they have entered a dead end, and are therefore doing everything possible to turn our motherland into a military base. Domestic and foreign reactionaries are trying to suppress the activities of our party, which has been bravely fighting in the recent House of Councillors election, opposing the establishment of military bases, and striving for national independence and peace, but they have not succeeded. Therefore, like a fatally wounded beast, they have begun to take extremely brutal actions.
　　Fellow patriots across the country! The suppression of our party by domestic and foreign reactionaries is nothing more than an attack on all the people. The examples of Hitler and Tojo show that if we retreat one step in the face of such suppression, the freedom of the Japanese people will be trampled on, and all the people will become slaves. Patriotic compatriots! We call on you to rise up with us to defend our beloved motherland from becoming a base for new wars and being destroyed, and to defend our party, which is committed to our national independence to the end. No suppression can break the strong bond between our party and the people. No suppression can shatter our party and our nation. The history of the world shows that our party will live forever while advancing together with all patriotic people! Today, four-tenths of humanity, together with the communist parties of all countries, are building a fortress of peace, freedom, and independence, socialist and people's democratic countries. The dawn of liberation is approaching the sky above our motherland. Fellow patriots! Led by the working class, rise up and dispel the darkness before dawn with resolute mass action. Justice and victory are on the side of our party and all the patriots of our country!

　　日共向爱国者发出号召
    保卫祖国反对作新战争基地 
    美日反动派的镇压决阻止不住人民前进
    【新华社讯】据莫斯科八日广播：东京消息，赤旗报发表日本共产党六日向日本一切爱国者发出号召，大意如下：
    吉田内阁驱逐日本共产党全体中央委员的狂暴镇压，是很明显地违反了波茨坦宣言及远东委员会的十六项原则的。这很明显地证实了国际反动力量在全世界遭受到惨败，特别是在亚洲它已走进了死巷，因此竭尽全力企图将我们的祖国当作军事基地。国内外反动派企图把最近在参院选举上、在反对设立军事基地、争取民族的独立与和平方面进行英勇斗争的我党的活动，压制下去，但却未成功。因而好像负了致命伤的野兽一般，开始采取极狂暴的行动。
    全国的爱国同胞们！内外反动派对我党实行的镇压，不外是对全体人民的进攻。希特勒和东条的实例表明了在遭受到这种镇压时，如果后退一步的话，日本人民的自由便被蹂躏，全体人民将成为奴隶。爱国的同胞们！我们向你们号召：和我们一道起来，拥护保卫我们亲爱祖国以免变为新战争的基地和遭受破坏、并保卫我们民族独立到底的我们的党。任何镇压都不能分散我们的党和人民的坚强的结合。任何镇压都不能打碎我们的党和我们的民族。全世界的历史都表明我们的党在和全体爱国人民共同前进期间，会永远生存下去的！现在，十分之四的人类与各国的共产党一同在建设着和平、自由、独立的堡垒，社会主义和人民民主主义国家。解放的曙光在接近着我们祖国的上空。全体爱国同胞们！以工人阶级为首起来用坚决的群众性的行动驱散黎明前的黑暗，正义和胜利是在我们的党和我们国家全体爱国者这一方面的！
