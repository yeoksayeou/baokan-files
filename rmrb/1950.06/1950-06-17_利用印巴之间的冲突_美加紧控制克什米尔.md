Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: Imperialist America is taking advantage of the conflict between India and Pakistan in the Kashmir region to try to deepen its influence there. According to Agence France-Presse: Australian Judge Dixon, an agent of the United States, recently arrived in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, and held talks with Kashmiri Prime Minister Abdullah. Dixon was illegally appointed by the Security Council at the instigation of the United States, after the Soviet Union withdrew, as the so-called "arbitrator of the Kashmir issue." Dixon attempted to persuade Abdullah to agree to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir as soon as possible, under the "supervision" of U.S. Admiral Nimitz, to decide the fate of Kashmir. The United States, through the United Nations organization, has also appointed former commander of the U.S. First Army, Hodges, as Dixon's "military advisor," enabling Dixon to better serve his American masters. The United Nations has notified the Indian government of this appointment.

Kashmir was originally a princely state in northern India. After World War II, Abdullah of the Kashmir National Congress overthrew the rule of the maharajah. On October 22, 1947, under British instigation, the Pakistani government sent troops to invade Kashmir. Abdullah resisted the Pakistani offensive while introducing Indian troops into Kashmir, thus forming the ongoing confrontation between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.

### 利用印巴之间的冲突  美加紧控制克什米尔

　　利用印巴之间的冲突
    美加紧控制克什米尔
    【新华社十五日讯】美帝国主义正利用印度和巴基斯坦两国在克什米尔地区的冲突，努力将自己的势力深入该地。据法新社讯：美国的代理人澳大利亚法官迪逊，已于最近抵达克什米尔首府斯利那加，并与克什米尔总理阿伯杜拉举行过会谈。迪逊是在苏联退席之下，由美国促使安理会非法任命其为所谓“克什米尔问题的仲裁人”的。迪逊曾图说服阿伯杜拉同意在美国海军上将尼米兹的“监督下”，尽早举行克什米尔的公民投票，来决定克什米尔的命运。美国又经由联合国组织任命前美国第一军军长赫奇斯为迪逊的“军事顾问”，使迪逊更好地效忠于其美国主子。此项任命已由联合国通知印度政府。
    按克什米尔原为印度北部的一个土邦。第二次世界大战后，克什米尔国大党的阿伯杜拉推翻了王公统治。一九四七年十月二十二日，巴基斯坦政府在英国策动下派兵侵入克什米尔，阿伯杜拉一面抵抗巴基斯坦的进攻，一面把印度军队引入克什米尔，遂形成了持续至今的印度和巴基斯坦在克什米尔的对峙局面。
