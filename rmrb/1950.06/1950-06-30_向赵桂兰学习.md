　　Learning from Zhao Guilan
    How to Learn from Zhao Guilan
    Li Changhan
    Since reading the story of Comrade Zhao Guilan's heroic sacrifice for the interests of the Party and the people, I have constantly examined myself against the principle that a Communist Party member should be prepared to sacrifice himself for the cause of the Party and the people at any time and in any place. Some comrades who have been tested through long and arduous struggles may say: In the long War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, holding explosives, carrying landmines, blowing up bunkers, scaling city walls, and even engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, weren't these all concrete examples of comrades bravely sacrificing themselves for the interests of the revolution? So what's so remarkable about Zhao Guilan's sacrifice? Yes, we do not deny these great achievements. And we recognize that without the tireless and selfless struggles of our Party members and revolutionary soldiers charging into battle day and night, there would be no victory today. However, when among us appears a young and outstanding Party member like Zhao Guilan—a twenty-year-old girl, who has been a Party member for only one year, who can so bravely sacrifice herself to protect the property of the people; who, despite being severely injured and disabled, still thinks about the work of the Party and does not worry or fret about personal matters. Isn't this worthy of our learning? Especially for comrades who are boasting of their past achievements to the Party and the people and demanding personal enjoyment, it is even more necessary to learn from her.

    Perhaps some comrades will say, "If I were in that situation, I would definitely learn from Comrade Zhao Guilan and decide not to throw the fulminate of mercury." This is also not a realistic and honest attitude. History will not repeat itself, and individual work positions are different, so this assumption is just an assumption and is not true. I think learning from Zhao Guilan is not about learning her specific action of not throwing the fulminate of mercury and hurting herself, but about learning her selfless and selfless, noble qualities of being ready to sacrifice herself for the cause of the Party at any time and in any place. And use this to block the shameful excuses of those vacillating, compromising, and betraying opportunists who claim to have "the right to protect their health and value their lives."

    Clear Away the Influence of the Old Society and Better Accept the Education of the Party
    For the People
    After I read the article "The Good Daughter of the Communist Party - Zhao Guilan" in the newspaper, I examined my past. During a certain pre-battle sprint, each comrade was responsible for fourteen hours of work, but what about me? I went to rest because of a slight stomach ache, abandoning my work to take care of my body. Usually, I often doze off at work, do my work very carelessly, do it when work comes, and play when it's done. I don't even think about studying. Compared with Comrade Zhao Guilan, I feel very ashamed. Why do I do such things under the same leadership of the Party? The Party has made great efforts to educate me, mainly because my level of awareness is too low, and I am too deeply influenced by the old society and old ideas, which prevents me from quickly accepting revolutionary education. This time, Comrade Zhao Guilan has opened up a path for me to move forward. I want to learn from Comrade Zhao Guilan very well.

    Resolutely Overcome My Complacency
    Zhao Qingyu
    Comrade Zhao Guilan: You are an excellent and outstanding daughter of New China. You were gloriously injured and disabled in order to protect the property of the motherland. After I saw your deeds in the newspaper, I always felt a kind of class affection. I am writing you a letter in my busy schedule as a consolation after you come to Beijing, and I wish you good health.

    I am also a disabled person who has been nurtured by the Party. I was injured in the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1942, and my right arm lost its function. At that time, I was very depressed and pessimistic, but the Party educated me and cultivated me, and I have never left the Party. I have made three major contributions in the War of Liberation and the Land Reform, and have been elected as a model twice. But disability is always a mental burden for me personally. In addition, I sometimes carry the burden of being a "meritorious person," especially since entering the city, my progress has been very slow. This time, what you said at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Although I was injured and disabled because of my love for labor and love for the property of the motherland, my mind is not disabled, so I am not discouraged at all" deeply inspired me. I will resolutely overcome this complacency under the correct leadership of the Party.

    Examine My Individualistic Thoughts Under the Guise of Revolutionary Interests
    Zhou Pan
    Comrade Zhao Guilan's heroic behavior has deeply enlightened and educated me—an intellectual from a petty-bourgeois background. The first thing I thought was, if I were her, how would I deal with my life? Undoubtedly, the first thought that would appear would only be: "What if it explodes and kills me? I am still very young, I cannot die! If things are damaged, they can be rebuilt, and living can better serve the Party." This fully demonstrates my petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness—first calculating personal interests, then thinking of the interests of the people, and finally putting a hat of the interests of the people on personal interests. For example, when I was elected by my classmates to do some copying work, I didn't think about whether these tasks were beneficial to everyone's studies, but only thought that I didn't like doing such work. So I said that I should seize the time to study, so that I can better serve the people in the future. For example, during the winter vacation, I clearly wanted to go home to see my mother, but I had to say that going home could transform the family and understand the living conditions of the peasants after liberation, etc. It sounds like it is really starting from the interests of the people; but in essence, it is all for personal calculation. Comrade Zhao Guilan's heroic behavior made me reflect that if it comes to "personal interests unconditionally obeying the interests of the people," I would say it more beautifully than her, but when it comes to actual tests, I will be exposed. I think Comrade Zhao Guilan's greatness lies in the fact that in such a serious situation, she can first consider the interests of the motherland and the people; instead of just saying or writing in words that personal interests should obey overall interests.

    Resolutely Fight Against Individualistic Thoughts
    Huang Yineng
    I am not a Party member, but "Party life" has become a part of my life. When I came into contact with the question of whether Zhao Guilan should throw the fulminate of mercury, I thought that Zhao Guilan's spirit of obeying the interests of the people was really great, but I did not admire her handling method. As Wang Zhihong said, "Her personal interests are not equal to her health and life." But after repeated thinking, I made a firm struggle with this thought. I found that I had not yet dug out the poisonous roots of individualism. I am only "appreciating" those heroic deeds of sacrificing oneself to obey the interests of the people, while I am trapped in the circle of personal interests all day long. In front of Zhao Guilan, my individualism was exposed. I sang loudly, "Obey the interests of the people! Great! Glory!" But when the fulminate of mercury is about to explode in your hand, throw it away! Losing some machines is much less than sacrificing yourself. Because cadres are more important than machines! Because I am still young, I want to do more work for the people! Because personal interests are not equal to one's own life. I carefully examined my thoughts and found that these "reasons" were the demons in my thoughts, and these reasons were all fabricated by individualism. "The interests of the people? The interests of the Party? But it's not worth it to die!" This is the essence of my individualistic thinking. The Party helped me fight a battle, and Zhao Guilan helped me fight a battle. In front of the Party, in front of Zhao Guilan, I will resolutely fight against individualism and declare its death sentence.

　　向赵桂兰学习
    怎样学习赵桂兰
    李长汉
    自从读了赵桂兰同志为了党和人民的利益英勇牺牲自己的故事后，我时刻拿着共产党员要随时随地准备为党与人民的事业牺牲自己的原则来检查自己。有些经过长期艰苦斗争考验的部队同志，也许会这样说：在长期的抗日战争和解放战争中，抱炸药，捧地雷，炸堡垒，爬城墙，以至于和敌人肉搏等等，难道不都是同志们为革命利益而英勇牺牲的具体事实吗？那么赵桂兰这样的牺牲又有什么了不起呢？是的，我们并不否认这些伟大的功绩。并且认识到如果没有我们这些党员与革命战士的日以继夜的冲锋陷阵的忘我的斗争，就不可能有今天的胜利。但是，当在我们中间，出现了像赵桂兰这样年青优秀的党员——一个二十岁的女孩子，党龄才满一周岁，能够这样英勇地为保护人民财产而牺牲自己；伤势惨重已成残废的情况下仍然念念不忘党的工作，而未丝毫为个人问题而忧愁烦恼。这难道不值得我们学习吗？特别是正在以自己过去的功绩向党向人民骄傲而要求个人享受的同志，是更应当来学习的。
    也许有的同志会这样说：“我要遇到那种情况，一定向赵桂兰同志学习，决定不扔雷汞。”这也不是实事求是的老实态度。历史是不会重复的，个人工作岗位也不同，因此这个假定仅仅是一个假定，是不真实的。我认为学习赵桂兰并不学习她的不扔雷汞炸坏自己的具体事情，而是要学习她忘我无私，为党的事业随时随地准备牺牲自己的高贵的品质。并以此堵死那些动摇、妥协变节的机会主义者的“有权保护自己的健康和重视自己的生命”的可耻的借口。
    清算旧社会的影响  更好地接受党的教育
    为民
    当我读了报纸上登载的“共产党的好女儿——赵桂兰”以后，我检查了我的过去。在某次战役前的突击工作中，每个同志都肩负起十四小时的工作，但我呢？却因一点胃病而去休养，就这样抛弃了自己的工作而照顾了自己的身体。平时我常在工作中打瞌睡，做工作非常马虎，工作来了就做，做完了就玩。根本想不到学习。和赵桂兰同志一比之下，我感觉到非常惭愧。为什么我同样的在党的领导下而做出这样的事情呢？党是尽了很大的力量来教育我的，主要由于自己的觉悟程度太低，而受旧社会、旧思想的影响太深，使我不能很快的接受革命教育。这次赵桂兰同志给我开辟了前进的道路，我要很好的向赵桂兰同志学习。
    坚决克服我的自满情绪
    赵清玉
    赵桂兰同志：你是新中国的一个优秀杰出的女儿，你为了保护祖国的财产，光荣负伤成了残废。我在报纸上看到了你的事迹后，总感到有一种阶级的亲爱，我在百忙中给你写一封信，作为你来京后的慰问，并祝你身体健康。
    我也是受过党的培养的一个残废人。我在一九四二年抗日战争负伤，右胳膊失去作用。当时非常苦闷悲观，但党教育了我，培养了我，我始终也没离开过党。在解放战争和土地改革中曾经立过三次大功，当选过两次模范。但残废对于我个人来说终是一个精神上的负担。再加上有时还背着“功臣”包袱，特别是进城以来，我的进步就非常慢了，这次你在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上讲的：“我虽是由于热爱劳动和热爱祖国的财产负了伤成了残废，但我的思想并未残废，因此我一点也不灰心”深深启发了我。我将在党的正确领导下坚决克服这种自满情绪。
    检讨我以革命利益为掩护的个人主义思想
    周盼
    赵桂兰同志的英雄行为，深深地启发教育了我——一个小资产阶级出身的知识分子。我首先想，假若我是她的话，我将怎样来处理自己生命呢？毫无疑问，第一个出现的思想只能是：“炸死了怎么办呢？我还很年轻，我不能死！东西炸坏了可以重新建设，活着可以更好地为党工作。”这就充分地表现了我的小资产阶级的思想意识——首先盘算个人利益，然后想到人民利益，最后将个人利益戴上人民利益的帽子。例如当我被同学选出作一些抄写工作时，我并没有想一想这些工作对大家的学习是否有利，而只想到我不喜欢作这样的工作。于是我说，我应该抓紧时间读书，这样将来才能更好地为人民服务。又如寒假期间，我明明是想回家去看我的妈妈，却偏要说回家去可以改造家庭，可以了解解放后农民生活的情况等。说起来，好像真是从人民利益出发；而实质上却全是为个人盘算。赵桂兰同志的英雄行为使我反省，如果说起“个人利益无条件服从于人民利益”来，我是会比她说得漂亮的，然而一遇到实际的考验，就原形毕露了。我觉得赵桂兰同志的伟大，就在于她在这样严重的情况下，她能够先考虑祖国和人民的利益；而不是只在口头上说或字面上写着要个人利益服从整体利益。
    坚决和个人主义思想作斗争
    黄异能
    我不是一个党员，但“党的生活”成了我生活的一部分。当我接触到赵桂兰应不应扔雷汞的问题时，我想赵桂兰这种服从人民利益的精神真伟大，但她的处理方法我就不佩服了。正如汪志鸿所说的“她个人的利益并不等于她的健康和生命呵”。但经过了反复的思考，我与这种思想作了坚决的斗争。我发觉我还没有挖掉个人主义的毒根。我只在“欣赏”着那些牺牲自己服从人民利益的英勇事迹，而自己则终日困在个人利益的圈子里。在赵桂兰的面前，暴露了我的个人主义，我高唱着“服从人民的利益呵！伟大呵！光荣呵！”但雷汞要是在自己手上爆炸时，扔掉它吧！损失一些机器比牺牲自己是轻微得多。因为干部比机器更重要呀！因为我还年青我要为人民作更多的工作呀！因为个人利益并不等于自己的生命呀。我仔细检查了自己的思想，发觉这些“理由”是我思想中的恶魔，这些理由全是个人主义驱使着我去捏造的。“人民的利益吗？党的利益吗？但自己死了划不来呀！”这就是我个人主义思想的本质。党帮我打了一仗，赵桂兰帮我打了一仗。在党的面前，在赵桂兰的面前，我将坚决地和个人主义作斗争，并宣布它的死刑。
