　　Village Cadres Obstruct Freedom of Marriage, Assist Parents in Beating Daughter-in-Law
　　Liu Daling, a woman from Xisun Village, Third District, Rongcheng, Hebei, personally came to this newspaper on May 30th to complain about being beaten by village cadres, militia, and her father-in-law due to a marriage issue. The following is a record of her complaint.
　　When I was very young, my parents betrothed me to Bao Zhenmei of Xisun Village, Third District, Rongcheng. When I grew up, I heard people say that he had a mental illness. The surrounding villages all knew he had this problem, but my family didn't tell me. When I found out, I asked to dissolve the engagement, but my father refused, telling me to "follow the chicken if you marry a chicken, follow the dog if you marry a dog." When I was nineteen, I was forced to marry Bao Zhenmei. After the marriage, I indeed found that Bao had a mental illness, sometimes clear, sometimes confused. He often hit me. He couldn't even carry water, so I had to carry water with the child in my arms. He couldn't do any other productive work. My father-in-law also hit me, even dragging me outside to beat me, sometimes not letting me eat, hiding the food. In the second year of marriage, I asked for a divorce. At that time, the village cadres said, "If you leave, he won't be able to find a woman," and wouldn't let me divorce. When my father-in-law heard that I wanted a divorce, he cursed in the streets and beat me with the boards from a large cart. Once, my father-in-law hit three bumps on my head. I complained to the village cadres, and the village cadres said, "It doesn't matter, adults beating children." I really couldn't bear this anger, so I had to go back to my parents' home to live. The village cadres and militia came to my parents' home to force me to return. When I refused, they tied me up with ropes and took me away. Back in the village, they locked me up during the day and hung me up to beat me at night. They were cruel, using leather whips and water-soaked hemp ropes to beat me. Those who beat me included militiamen Gao Daluan, Gao Zhaohu, and village chief Bao Wuzi, among others. They beat me more than once. Because of this, I don't know how many times I went to the district government. But the district asked me for a letter of introduction from the village government. The village cadres wouldn't let me divorce, so how could they write me a letter of introduction? Later, I went to the county government to ask for a divorce. The people at the county government wouldn't let me in, asking me for a letter from the district. My divorce issue has been dragging on. I still live in my parents' home. I secretly ran to Beijing. I went to the court, and the court asked me to return to the defendant's place to file a lawsuit. What can I do if I go back? I can only ask the People's Daily to help me solve this problem.

　　Editor's Note: According to the situation described by Liu Daling, her request for divorce is legitimate. The Rongcheng County Government and People's Court should resolve it. The parents, village cadres, and militia who illegally beat Liu Daling should be given legal punishment. Liu Daling said that after the newspaper publishes this event, she will definitely suffer more beatings. The stubbornness of the parents and the barbarity of the backward village cadres are evident. It is hoped that the local county and district governments will be responsible for protecting Liu Daling's safety, so that illegal retaliatory behavior does not occur.

### 村干部阻挠婚姻自由  协助家长毒打儿媳妇

　　村干部阻挠婚姻自由  协助家长毒打儿媳妇
    河北容城三区西孙村妇女刘大领，于五月三十日亲来本报申诉因婚姻问题被村干部、民兵及公公毒打的情形。下面就是她的申诉的笔录。
    在我很小的时候，父母就把我许给容城三区西孙村鲍振梅。到我大了，才听人说他有神经病。附近各村都知道他有这毛病，但我家并没告诉我。我知道了，要求解除婚约，但父亲不答应，要我“嫁鸡随鸡，嫁狗随狗”。在我十九岁那一年，我即被迫与鲍振梅结婚。婚后果然发现鲍是有疯病的，一会儿清醒，一会儿糊糊涂涂。他经常打我。他连水也不能挑，我只好抱着孩子去提水。其他生产工作他都不能干。我公公也打我，甚至把我拖到门外去打，有时不让我吃饭，把饭藏起来。结婚第二年，我就要求离婚。当时村干部说：“你走了，他就寻不着女人了”，不让我离婚。公公听说我要离婚，就到处骂街，用大车上的枷板打我。有一次公公在我头上打了三个包。我向村干部申诉，村干部说：“这没关系，大人打小人。”这种气，我实在受不了，我只好回娘家去住。村干部和民兵就到我娘家来，要我回去。我不回去，他们就用绳子把我捆走。回到村里，白天把我关起来，晚上把我吊起来打。他们心狠，用皮鞭、用水浸湿的麻绳子打。打我的有民兵高大銮、高赵虎，和村长鲍吾字等。他们打我不止这一次。为了这事，我不知去过区政府多少次。但是区里向我要村政府的介绍信。村干部既不让我离婚，怎么会给我写介绍信呢？后来我到县府去要求离婚。县府的人不让我进去，向我要区上的信。我的离婚问题就一直拖下来。我现在还住在娘家。我偷偷跑到北京来。我到法院，法院要我回到被告的地方去起诉。我回去有什么办法呢？我只有找人民日报帮助我解决这个问题。
    编者按：根据刘大领所述的情形来看，她的离婚要求是正当的。容城县府及人民法院，应该予以解决。对非法毒打刘大领的家长、村干部、民兵等，应该分别给以法律处分。刘大领说报纸发表此一事件后，她一定又要遭受毒打。顽固家长和落后村干部的蛮横可见一斑。望当地县区政府负责保护刘大领的安全，使非法的报复行为不致发生。
