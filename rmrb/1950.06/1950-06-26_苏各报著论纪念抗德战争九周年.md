Xinhua News Agency, June 24th dispatch from Moscow (TASS): Soviet newspapers all published editorials on June 22nd to commemorate the ninth anniversary of the treacherous invasion of the Soviet Union by the Hitlerite gang.

　　The *Pravda* editorial, titled "The Strength of the Soviet System," pointed out: The enormous damage inflicted on the Soviet national economy by the vile and shameless enemy would have inevitably caused even the largest capitalist country to regress for decades and inevitably be reduced to a second-rate power. However, the Soviet Union was not like that. In the years after the war, thanks to the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people, the Soviet economy has achieved one victory after another, developing at an unprecedented pace according to a unified plan. The great superiority of the Soviet social and state system has become even more evident.
　
Xinhua News Agency, June 24th dispatch from Moscow, June 22nd: To commemorate the ninth anniversary of the Hitlerite gang's invasion of the Soviet Union, the magazine *New Times* published a special article by Major General Isayev entitled "Great Lessons of History."

　　Major General Isayev wrote: The decisive failure of the Hitlerite German army's strategy in its armed struggle against the Soviet Union was essentially the failure of bourgeois military science in general when it encountered Stalin's Soviet military science.

　　The American and British imperialists are meticulously drawing up a war plan, deliberately seeking to establish their world hegemony, and aiming the spearhead of this war at the Soviet Union. They are preparing to use atomic bombs, as well as chemical and bacteriological weapons of mass destruction. However, all these aggressive plans for war adventures have even less chance of success than the aggressive plans for war adventures of the German fascists in their day.

　　A large-scale modern war cannot be won by the destructive air raids of American planes, even if they use atomic bombs, especially since the country being attacked is now able to retaliate with atomic weapons. A large-scale modern war requires powerful armed forces to conduct extensive ground combat operations. However, the American and British warmongers do not have, and cannot have, even the army that Hitler once had.

　　In modern warfare, as Comrade Stalin has defined with brilliant precision: the moral factor is one of the basic and permanently operating factors that, along with the stability of the rear, the quantity and quality of divisions, the equipment of the army, and the organizational ability of the commanders, determine the outcome of the war. The closer the social and state system, as well as the state policy and war aims, conform to the fundamental interests of the people, the more vigorous the morale of the people at the front and in the rear in their struggle for victory. The social and state system of imperialist countries, as well as the policies of their ruling classes and their aims in war, directly violate the fundamental interests of the masses. This is the weakness of today's imperialist warmongers.

　　American warmongers have not yet abandoned the hope of using the people of Western European countries as cannon fodder. However, the people of all countries have learned a great deal in the past ten years, and it can be boldly said that this trump card of American politicians and strategists has already been lost in advance.

　　Hundreds of millions of people around the world are determined to prevent American imperialists from launching another world war. The indisputable proof of this is the peace defenders' movement. Hundreds of millions of people have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal, and the warmongers have become increasingly isolated.

　　The relative strength of the forces of imperialism compared to the forces of democracy and socialism has clearly changed. And, of course, not in a way that is favorable to the conspirators of the London business district and New York's Wall Street.

　　Modern warfare, in many respects, is already decided before the war begins. The American and British bloc has already lost its planned war of aggression morally and politically. The powerful movement to defend peace is proof of this. Peace defenders need to make great and ever-increasing efforts to prevent the imperialists from plotting a new world war. However, even if the imperialists start a war, it will inevitably end with the collapse of the entire imperialist system. This is the lesson of the Second World War, and a rigorous analysis of the balance of power between the two sides on the international political stage has confirmed that this is correct.

### 苏各报著论纪念抗德战争九周年

　　苏各报著论纪念抗德战争九周年
    《新时代》指出：希特勒德军战略的失败，是资产阶级战争科学遇到了斯大林战争科学时所受到的失败。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各报于二十二日都发表社论，以纪念希特勒匪帮背信弃义侵略苏联的九周年。
    真理报在题为《苏维埃制度的力量》的社论中指出：卑鄙无耻的敌人所加于苏联国民经济的巨大破坏，是会使一个最大的资本主义国家，也不可避免地倒退数十年，而且必然会因之降为二等国的。然而，苏联这个国家却不是这样。在战后数年内，由于苏联人民的和平的与创造性的劳动，苏维埃经济已取得一个接着一个的胜利，正空前迅速地依照单一的计划发展着。苏联社会和国家制度的伟大优越性，已变得更为明显了。
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：为纪念希特勒匪帮进犯苏联第九周年，《新时代》杂志刊载伊萨耶夫少将所撰题为《历史的伟大教训》的专文。
    伊萨耶夫少将写道：希特勒德军的战略在对苏联武装斗争中所受到的决定性的失败，实质上就是一般的资产阶级的战争科学遇到了苏联斯大林的战争科学时所受到的失败。
    美国和英国的帝国主义者们，正在精密地拟订一种战争计划，蓄意建立他们的世界霸权，又使这种战争的刀锋针对着苏联。他们准备运用原子弹，以及从事大规模毁灭的化学武器和细菌武器。但是，所有这一切从事战争冒险的侵略计划，比当年德国法西斯战争冒险的侵略计划，是更少成功的机会了。
    大规模的现代战争，不能凭美国飞机的破坏性的空袭赢得胜利，即使他们使用了原子弹，也不能获胜，何况现在被进攻的国家已能够用原子武器还击了。大规模的现代战争，需要强大的武装部队以进行广泛的地面上的战斗行动。然而，连像希特勒所曾有过的陆军，美英战争贩子们也都没有，而且也不可能有。
    在现代战争中，正如斯大林同志以辉煌的精确性所下的定义：士气的因素，是与后方的稳定、师团的数量和素质、军队的装备以及指挥人员的组织能力，一同决定战争胜负的那些基本的永久发生作用的因素之一。社会制度和国家制度，以及国家政策与战争目的，对人民的基本利益符合得越密切，前方和后方人民在为胜利而斗争中所表现的士气，也就越旺盛。帝国主义国家的社会制度和国家制度，以及他们的统治阶级的政策和他们在战争中的目的，都直接违反群众的基本利益。这便是今日帝国主义战争贩子们的弱点。
    美国战争贩子们还不曾抛弃关于利用西欧各国人民充当炮灰的希望。然而，各国人民在这过去十年间已懂得了许多事情，可以大胆说一句，美国政治家们和战略家们的这张王牌，已预先打输了。
    世界各地亿万人民都抱定决心，要阻止美国帝国主义者发动另一次世界大战。关于这一方面的不容争论的明证便是：和平保卫者的运动，几万万人民已在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签了名，而战争贩子已日益陷于孤立了。
    帝国主义的势力，跟民主与社会主义的势力相对的强度，已显然起了变化。而且，当然不是对伦敦商业区和纽约华尔街阴谋分子有利的一种变化。
    现代战争，就许多方面而言，在战争开始以前就已经分出胜负来了。美英集团在士气上和政治上已经把他们所准备的侵略战争打输了。保卫和平的强大运动，便是这一方面的明证。和平保卫者们需要作极大的日益增强的努力，来防止帝国主义者们在阴谋策划的新的世界大战。然而，即使帝国主义者们使战争爆发了，那将必然地以整个帝国主义制度的崩溃为结局。这是第二次世界大战的教训，而就国际政治舞台上双方实力的对比所作的严谨的分析，已确证这一点是正确的。
