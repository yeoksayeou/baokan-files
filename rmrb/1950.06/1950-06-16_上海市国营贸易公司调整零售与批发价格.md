The difference between the wholesale and retail prices of grain has been adjusted twice: the first time on June 5th, the difference between the retail and wholesale price of rice per dan was expanded from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan; the second time on the 12th, both the retail and wholesale prices were adjusted simultaneously, with the difference between the retail and wholesale prices expanding from 10,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan. The price difference between the wholesale and retail prices of edible oil was increased from 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent on the 12th. The price difference between the warehouse price and the zero-batch price of edible salt increased by 5 to 6 percent at the beginning of the month. The difference between the wholesale and retail prices of sugar was increased from the original 10 to 15 percent to 12 to 15 percent on the 10th. The wholesale price of cloth also underwent two adjustments in a week, with Longtou fine cloth falling from 250,000 yuan per bolt on the 4th to 240,000 yuan on the 12th. The adjustment of the listed prices has made retail business profitable. According to the head of the Rice Industry Association, after deducting industrial and commercial tax, transportation costs, stamp tax, and other expenses, the retail price of rice after the adjustment can yield a gross profit of 3,179 yuan per shi.
