Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd (TASS dispatch): Today's *Pravda* published an article by Loshchakov entitled "Important Factors in the Economic Development of People's Democratic Countries," which discusses in detail the trade relations between the People's Democratic Countries and the Soviet Union.

　　Loshchakov begins the article by comparing the two approaches to mutual economic relations - the socialist approach and the capitalist approach.

　　Loshchakov states: The basis of business relations between capitalist countries is the attempt by powerful monopolies to dominate the economies of other countries, to make them conform to the demands of imperialist powers, and thus to enslave these countries and their people. This is the case with the "economic cooperation" between the United States and Western European countries.

　　The trade relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries, however, are based on completely different principles. The treaties and agreements concluded by the Soviet Union with the governments of the brotherly republics are equal treaties and agreements based on respect for national interests, ensuring that the People's Democratic Countries can obtain the Soviet Union's selfless assistance in their economic development and prosperity.

　　The Soviet Union helps the People's Democratic Countries consolidate and develop their national industries by supplying them with industrial equipment and raw materials, enabling them to re-equip their national economies on the basis of new technologies.

　　Loshchakov emphasizes that before the Second World War, there were only weak economic ties between the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe, as well as between them and the Soviet Union, and discusses the economic cooperation that immediately began between the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe after they were liberated from fascist shackles. He then writes: The fact that the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe have adopted a planned approach to their economies has greatly helped to expand economic relations between these countries and the Soviet Union. The total volume of trade is increasing year by year. The total trade volume between Poland and the Soviet Union in 1945 was 350 million rubles, but in 1948 it had increased to 1.2 billion rubles. In 1949, the total trade volume between the Hungarian Republic and the Soviet Union increased by more than twofold compared to 1948.

　　The industrialization of the People's Democratic Countries is a major and indispensable condition for building socialism, and the Soviet Union provides the People's Democratic Countries with enormous and selfless assistance in this regard.

　　Loshchakov continues: The various agreements on the total volume of trade in 1950 stipulate that the exchange of goods between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries will be much greater than last year.

　　Long-term agreements play a significant role in expanding trade volume and completing national economic plans. These agreements establish permanent ties between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries, ensuring a continuous flow of goods.

　　According to these agreements, the Soviet Union will supply Poland and Bulgaria with the complex equipment needed for new steel plants, especially the complex equipment needed for the metallurgical combine near Krakow, as well as the equipment needed for the Polish cement industry and large power stations, and the equipment needed for the large textile factory currently under construction in Hungary and the equipment needed for several enterprises in other countries. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also providing extensive technical assistance in the construction of new enterprises, railways and irrigation canals in the People's Democratic Countries.

　　The Soviet Union supplies Albania with industrial, railway and other equipment, raw materials, agricultural machinery and various goods needed by the Albanian national economy. In addition to economic assistance, the Soviet Union is also providing Albania with the technical assistance needed to build industrial enterprises, power plants, etc., on the basis of strengthening foreign trade relations.

　　Trade with the Soviet Union plays a very important role in the successful completion of national economic plans by the working men and women of the People's Democratic Countries. The Soviet Union's assistance, especially the assistance provided in the form of equipment and raw materials, will help promote the industrialization of the People's Democratic Countries, and first of all help the establishment and development of heavy industry.

　　Loshchakov points out the great role played by the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in promoting and strengthening economic relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania participate in the committee on an equal footing. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance greatly helps to expand trade between the member states of the committee. In 1948 and 1949, the People's Democratic Countries all concluded long-term trade agreements with each other.

　　Loshchakov points out: The close economic cooperation between the People's Democratic Countries and the Soviet Union has great benefits, which has been proven in practice. These benefits are indisputable. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic Countries are triumphantly laying the foundation for socialism.

　　Loshchakov further points out: The achievements made by the People's Democratic Countries in building the foundations of socialism - the achievements made thanks to the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union - are another heavy blow to bourgeois nationalists, to the despicable Tito-Rankovic clique that has turned Yugoslavia into a colony of Anglo-American imperialists.

　　In the People's Democratic Countries, working men and women feel the benefits of the Soviet Union's selfless assistance, while the people of all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia feel incredible hardship and harm, and are persecuted daily by the fascist police rule of the Tito clique.

### 人民民主国家在苏联的援助下正胜利地为社会主义奠定基础  真理报论人民民主国家经济发展要素

　　人民民主国家在苏联的援助下正胜利地为社会主义奠定基础
    真理报论人民民主国家经济发展要素
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二日电：今天真理报发表的洛希查科夫的题为《人民民主国家经济发展中的重要因素》一文，详论人民民主国家与苏联之间的贸易关系。
    洛希查科夫在文章开头，先将相互经济关系中的两种方针——社会主义的方针和资本主义的方针加以对比。
    洛希查科夫称：各资本主义国家之间的商务关系的基础，是强大的垄断企业想支配他国的经济、使之顺应帝国主义大国的要求、从而奴役这些国家及其人民的这种企图。美国和西欧各国的“经济合作”便是这样。
    苏联与人民民主国家的贸易关系却基于全然不同的原则。苏联与各兄弟共和国政府缔结的条约和协定，都是以尊重国家利益为基础的平等的条约和协定，确保人民民主国家在其经济发展和繁荣中，必能获得苏联大公无私的援助。
    苏联以工业装备和原料供给人民民主国家，从而帮助人民民主国家巩固和发展其民族工业，使之能把国民经济在新技术的基础上重新装备起来。
    洛希查科夫强调指出在第二次世界大战前，中欧和东南欧各国相互间以及和苏联之间仅有薄弱的经济联系，并且论及中欧和东南欧各国从法西斯羁绊下获得解放以后相互间立即开始的经济合作，接着写道：中欧和东南欧各国使经济采取有计划的方针，这个事实在很大的程度上有助于扩大这些国家和苏联之间的经济关系。换货总额一年比一年增加。一九四五年波兰和苏联之间的贸易总额是三亿五千万卢布，而一九四八年已增加到十二亿卢布。一九四九年匈牙利共和国与苏联之间的贸易总额已比一九四八年增加了两倍多。
    人民民主国家的工业化是建设社会主义的一个主要的不可缺少的条件，苏联在这一方面给予人民民主国家以巨大的大公无私的帮助。
    洛希查科夫继称：一九五○年关于换货总额的各项协定，规定了苏联和人民民主国家之间互相交付的货物更比去年大为增加。
    长期协定在扩大贸易额和完成国民经济计划方面起着重大的作用。这些协定确立了苏联和人民民主国家之间的永久的联系，保证货物得以源源交流。
    苏联根据这些协定，供给波兰和保加利亚的新钢铁厂所需的复杂装备、特别是克拉科附近的冶金康拜因所需的复杂装备，供给波兰水泥工业和大电力站所需的装备，供给匈牙利目前正在建设的大纺织厂以及其他国家若干企业所需的装备。同时，在人民民主国家建设新的企业、铁道和灌溉渠方面，苏联还给予广泛的技术援助。
    苏联以工业、铁道及其他的装备、原料、农业机器和阿尔巴尼亚国民经济所需要的各种货物供给阿尔巴尼亚。除了经济援助以外，苏联在加强对外贸易关系的基础上，还给予阿尔巴尼亚以建造工业企业、电力厂等所需的技术援助。
    与苏联贸易，在人民民主国家劳动男女们顺利完成国民经济计划方面，起了非常重要的作用。苏联的援助，特别是以交付装备和原料的方式所给予的援助，必将有助于促进人民民主国家的工业化，首先有助于重工业的创立和发展。
    洛希查科夫指出经济互助委员会在促进和加强苏联与人民民主国家之间的经济关系方面所起的巨大作用。在平等的基础上派遣代表参加委员会的有：苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚。经济互助委员会大有助于扩大该委员会的会员国相互间的贸易。在一九四八年和一九四九年，人民民主国家相互间都已缔结了长期的贸易协定。
    洛希查科夫指出：人民民主国家与苏联之间亲密的经济合作，具有极大的好处，这一点已在实际生活中获得证明。这些好处是无可争论的。人民民主国家在苏联的援助下，正胜利地为社会主义奠定基础。
    洛希查科夫进而指出：人民民主国家在建立社会主义的基础方面所得到的成就——由于苏联兄弟般的援助所得到的成就，对于资产阶级民族主义者，对于那个已把南斯拉夫变为英美帝国主义者之殖民地的卑劣的铁托——兰科维奇集团，是另一次沉重的打击。
    在人民民主国家中，男女劳动者身受到苏联大公无私的援助所产生的实惠，而南斯拉夫各族人民却感受到令人难以置信的困苦和损害，天天受到铁托集团的法西斯警察统治的迫害。
