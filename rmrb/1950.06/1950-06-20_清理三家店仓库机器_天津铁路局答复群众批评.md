　　Clearing Machines from the Sanjiadian Warehouse
　　Reply from the Tianjin Railway Bureau to Public Criticism

To the Editor:

　　I frequently travel on the railway, and every time I pass Sanjiadian Station, I see machines lying in the wasteland beside the railway. I don't know the exact name of these machines, but as far as I know, they were used by the Japanese invaders to mix sand and cement when building railway bridges. They are probably gasoline-powered and more efficient than manual labor. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, they were abandoned in the wasteland next to Sanjiadian Station and have remained untouched ever since. Recently, when I passed the station again, I saw that the iron sheets on the roof of a nearby warehouse had been removed for some reason, and the warehouse door had also been damaged. Through the broken door, I could see that there were about a dozen or twenty similar machines inside. Such many useful machines are exposed to the sun and rain, I am afraid they will be completely destroyed! I hope the railway bureau will conduct an investigation and deal with this matter as soon as possible.

　　After we forwarded this matter to the Tianjin Railway Bureau for investigation, we have received their reply. We are now publishing the reply below.

　　The Sanjiadian warehouse was originally a construction warehouse built by the Japanese invaders for the Tong (Datong) Tang (Tanggu) line. After the August 15th surrender of the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang reactionaries did not take good care of it and allowed people to destroy and steal. After liberation, it was continued to be managed by the Beijing Engineering Section of the Engineering Department of the Railway Bureau. Later, the Ministry of Railways planned to build the Tong-Tang line, and because some of the machines could still be repaired and used, they were not dealt with in a timely manner. The Railway Engineering Corps, which was undertaking the Tong-Tang project, had intended to take over these machines. However, after investigation, it was found that they were too old and the repair costs were too high, so the original proposal was withdrawn. This time, in order to unify the state's finances, the government thoroughly cleaned up and allocated the scattered materials and established the National Warehouse Material Clearing and Allocation Committee. In order to carry out this work, the Railway Bureau also cooperated with the Ministry of Railways to establish a branch within the bureau and transferred the three warehouses including Sanjiadian to the Xizhimen Engineering Machinery Repair Factory of the Engineering Department for management. The roof lead sheet of the original temporary warehouse was blown off by the last storm, and was not deliberately removed. During this cleanup, it was decided to dismantle it because the frame was found to be decayed and tilted, and the machines were moved to another warehouse for concentration. This project is being undertaken by the Sanjiadian Loading and Unloading Branch and will be completed soon. After the cleanup is completed, the allocation work will be carried out. Our Railway Bureau will definitely use great efforts to complete this work. As for the fact that our Railway Bureau failed to take the initiative to deal with these machines in the past, it is indeed because we did not pay enough attention to them. We sincerely accept the opinions raised by a reader in the newspaper. We hope that the broad masses will continue to supervise and help us to check our work.

### 清理三家店仓库机器  天津铁路局答复群众批评

　　清理三家店仓库机器
    天津铁路局答复群众批评编者同志：
    本人因经常在铁路上往来，每次途经三家店车站时都看见放在铁路旁荒地上的机器。此种机器名字不详，但据本人所知，这是日寇统治时期修铁路桥梁时用以混合沙土与洋灰者。它大概是用汽油发动的，效率大于人工。日寇投降后即弃置于三家店车站旁的荒地上，至今未动。最近本人经过该站时，复见该站附近仓库屋顶之铁板不知为何被掀去，库门也被破坏。由破烂之库门看见里面原来也有同样机器大约在一二十架以上。这样许多有用的机器在日晒雨淋之下，恐怕将要完全毁坏了！希望铁路局赶快进行调查处理。
                                          一读者
    这件事经我们转请天津铁路局进行调查后，已得到他们的答复。我们现在把复信公布在后面。
                                                  ——编者
    三家店仓库，原为日寇修建同（大同）塘（塘沽）线之工务仓库。八一五日寇投降后，国民党反动派即未加意保管，任人破坏偷窃。解放后归路局工务处北京工务段继续保管。后来铁道部计划准备修建同塘线，因有一部分机器尚可修配使用，遂未及时处理。承担同塘工程的铁道兵团曾拟接收此项机器。但经调查结果，以其残旧太甚，修理费用太大，遂又撤销原议。此次政府为了国家财经的统一，将遗散的物资彻底清理调配，成立全国仓库物资清理调配委员会。路局为了执行此项工作，也配合了铁道部成立了局内分会，将三家店等三仓库一并移交工务处西直门工务机械修配厂接管。原临时库房一所，房顶铅板系由上次暴风吹落，并非故意拆去。此次清理时因检查房架腐朽倾斜，现已决定拆除，将机件移至另一库房集中。此工程正由三家店装卸支会承做，即将完工。待清理完了，即进行调配工作。我们路局一定用大力来完成此工作。至于过去我们路局对此机件未能自动抓紧处理，确是对它重视不够，报纸一读者对我们提的意见，我们诚恳接受。希望广大群众继续督促，帮助我们来检查工作。
