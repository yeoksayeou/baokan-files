　　Cultural Palace Holds Photo Exhibition Commemorating the Ninth Anniversary of the Soviet War Against Germany
    [This newspaper dispatch] To commemorate the ninth anniversary of the treacherous invasion of the Soviet Union by Fascist Germany on June 22nd, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters and the Beijing Branch, with the assistance of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association, are holding a "Photo Exhibition Commemorating the Ninth Anniversary of the Soviet War Against Germany" at the Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace. The exhibition will run from today until July 10th. The exhibition will be open to the public from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM and from 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM daily. The exhibition consists of three parts: industry, military, and agriculture. There are over 300 pictures with explanatory text, filling a large hall.

    In the center of the hall hangs a large map of Europe. In the upper left corner is a famous quote from Stalin: "Now people recognize that the Soviet people, through their selfless struggle, saved European civilization from the iron heel of the fascist thugs. This is the great achievement of the Soviet people before human history." This statement is absolutely true. In the lower corner of the map is a small map of Europe, with Hitler's black spider resting in Berlin, spreading its black web over most of Europe! Millions upon millions of peaceful people groaned under the Nazi tyranny, and countless elderly, weak, women, and children were thrown into concentration camps! This simple little picture reminds people of the painful days of the past. But look at the whole map, the heroic Soviet army first drove the German invaders out of the country, recovered all its territory, and further advanced, liberating the capitals and people of eight European countries. Warsaw, Vienna, Prague, Bucharest, Sofia, Belgrade, Budapest, and Berlin on the map successively raised the victorious flags of the people.

    After seeing the pictures of Soviet industry and agriculture in the exhibition, people will understand why the Soviet Union played a decisive role in the final defeat of the German and Japanese fascists. At the exit of the exhibition hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao and a quote from him, explaining all this: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history. The Soviet people created great strength and acted as the main force in defeating fascism."

　　文化宫举行图片展览纪念苏联抗德战争九周年
    【本报讯】今天，六月二十二日，是法西斯德国背信弃义侵入苏联的九周年纪念日。在苏联对外文化协会的协助下，中苏友协总会及北京分会，特假北京劳动人民文化宫举行“纪念苏联抗德战争九周年图片展览会”，这一展览会将自今日开始，至七月十号结束。每日上午七时至十时，下午三时至八时，为开放展览会时间，欢迎各界市民前往参观。展览会由三大部分组成：工业、军事和农业。有解释文字的图片计三百多张，布满了一个大厅。
    在大厅正中悬挂了一幅很大的欧洲地图。左上角写着斯大林的一句名言：“现在人们都承认苏联人民以其奋不顾身的斗争从法西斯凶徒铁蹄之下救出了欧洲文明。这就是苏联人民在人类历史面前的伟大功勋。”这句话是千真万确的。挂图的下角有一个小欧洲地图，卧在柏林的希特勒黑蜘蛛，将它的黑网布满了大半个欧洲！千千万万个和平人民呻吟在纳粹淫威下，无数的老弱妇孺被投入集中营！这一张简单的小图使人忆起了已往的痛苦的日子。但再看全图吧，英勇的苏军首先驱逐了境内的德寇，光复了全部国土，并进一步向前推进，解放了八个欧洲国家的首都和人民，地图上的华沙、维也纳、布拉格、布加勒斯特、索非亚、贝尔格莱德、布达佩斯和柏林，先后插上了胜利的人民旗帜。
    看了展览会中苏联工业农业的图片后，人们便会明白为什么苏联在最后击溃德日法西斯的战争中起着决定性作用。展览会的出口，挂着毛主席的像和他的一句话，为这一切作了解释：“人民，只有人民，才能创造世界的动力，苏联人民创造了重大力量充当了打倒法西斯的主力军。”
