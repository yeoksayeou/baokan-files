　　Public Bus Company Holds Conference
    Awarding Those Who Contributed to Inventions
    Zhu Lin Awarded 10,000 Jin of Millet for Creating the "May 1st Type Gas Generator"
    [This newspaper reports] The Beijing Public Bus Company held its second awards ceremony on the 16th at the Dahua Cinema. Zhu Lin, the deputy director of the company's repair shop, designed the "May 1st Type Gas Generator" bus, which solved the serious fuel problem and played a significant role in reducing costs. The conference awarded him a banner and 10,000 jin of millet. According to current calculations, the "May 1st Type Gas Generator" bus saves more than 80,000 yuan in fuel per vehicle per day compared to charcoal buses and nearly 10,000 yuan compared to wood-burning buses. The May 1st Type Gas Generator also has the following advantages: 1. It is equipped with a slag remover, which separates the slag from the fire zone, not affecting combustion and increasing gas production; the engine does not need to be turned off during operation. 2. It is equipped with an automatic regulator, which mixes water vapor into the air and presses it into the air inlet pipe of the ignition furnace, which can maintain a certain high temperature in the furnace, increase the ignition gas, absorb hydrogen sulfide, and avoid corrosion of machine parts. 3. It is equipped with a water filter, which can prevent sulfur in the gas from entering the engine, extending the life of the machine. The furnace also uses electric blowing, which solves the difficulty of reignition after stalling, which has always been a problem for coal vehicles. In addition, saving engine oil and maintaining the cleanliness of the vehicle are also advantages of this gas generator.
    Lathe operator Zhu Guangming created a tool for polishing crankshafts. In the past, polishing crankshafts involved first filing with a file and then polishing with sandpaper, which could not guarantee that the finished product met specifications. Polishing one crankshaft took 24 hours. Now it only takes 6 hours. From January to May this year, 94 vehicles were overhauled and repaired, saving a total of 2,115 jin of millet due to the use of this new tool. The conference awarded Zhu Guangming a banner and 400 jin of millet.
    Repair worker Wei Xiangshan installed an engine test bench. On this engine test bench, the crankshaft speed can be adjusted arbitrarily using two gearboxes. In addition, a special type of clutch is installed. When testing a vehicle on this bench, if the engine speed exceeds the gearbox shaft speed, the clutch automatically separates the crankshaft from the gearbox. This saves three-quarters of a gallon of oil per vehicle tested, saves four labor hours, and reduces battery damage and wasted towing. Each repaired vehicle can save 60,000 yuan. From January to May this year, a total of 94 vehicles were overhauled and repaired, saving a total of more than 5,100 jin of millet. The conference awarded Wei Xiangshan a banner and 400 jin of millet. In addition, Li Dequan previously modified wood-burning furnaces, playing a certain role in reducing costs, and was awarded 400 jin of millet. Li Zhiping helped improve workers' skills and made a great contribution to improving wood-burning furnaces, and was awarded 400 jin of millet. Ironworker Shen Er created a set of "flange punches," which improved the quality and reduced working hours when making "flanges," saving more than 700 jin of millet, and was awarded 50 jin of millet.
    In terms of administrative affairs, 26 vehicles were rewarded, and a total of 170 drivers and conductors were rewarded. Eleven model workers were commended, and some were awarded medals.
    Jia Tingsan, Deputy Director of the Industrial Bureau, said at the conference that the public bus company has developed from the original five vehicles to the current 150; from 10,000 passengers per month to the current 1.11 million, which is the result of the efforts of all employees. He also encouraged the award winners not to be arrogant, but to set new records; those who did not win awards should catch up and strive to become heroes and models in the next period.
    Comrade Zhu Lin finally announced that he decided to donate 5,000 jin of millet from his 10,000 jin as a welfare fund for the trade union; 1,500 jin will be awarded to those who further improve the "May 1st Gas Generator" in the future; and 500 jin will be awarded to the drivers Li Zhongxian and Gao Feng who were the first to test the gas generator.
    In addition, before the awards ceremony, the trade union launched trade union group discussions on the award recipients and award conditions, and revised them according to the opinions of the workers, so it was more reasonable than the first award. In addition, the repair department in the repair shop did not have detailed records of work performance, so it was unable to select model workers.

　　公共汽车公司举行大会
    创造发明有功者受奖
    朱临创造“五一式煤气炉”得奖小米一万斤
    【本报讯】北京公共汽车公司于十六日假大华电影院举行第二次给奖大会。该公司修理厂副厂长朱临所设计的“五一式煤气炉”汽车，解决了严重的燃料问题，并对减低成本起了很大作用。大会奖予锦旗一面，小米一万斤。根据目前计算，“五一式煤气炉”汽车，较木炭汽车每车每日节省燃料八万余元，较木柴汽车节省近一万元。同时五一式煤气炉还有如下优点：一、装置有溶渣降落器，使溶渣脱离火带，不影响燃烧，增加煤气；在工作时，不必使引擎熄火。二、装置有自动调节器，使水蒸气混于空气中，压进发火炉的进风管内，可以保持炉中一定高温，增加发火煤气，吸收硫化氢，避免侵蚀机件。三、设置有一只水滤清器，可以使瓦斯中硫质不致侵入引擎，能延长机器寿命等。该炉并利用电动吹风，解决了历来煤车认为熄火后不易再燃的困难。此外，如节省机油，能保持车上的清洁等也都是这种煤气车的优点。
    车工朱光明创造了光曲轴的工具。过去光曲轴是先用锉刀锉后，再用砂纸磨光，不能保证成品合乎规格。每光一曲轴，要用二十四小时。现在只需要六小时。今年一至五月大修中修车九十四辆，因为利用了此项新工具，共节省小米二千一百一十五斤。大会奖给朱光明锦旗一面，小米四百斤。
    修理工魏香山装设了一部引擎试验台。在这种引擎试验台上，利用两个变速箱可以任意调节曲轴转速。此外并装置有特制克崩一只。在此台上试车，引擎转速超过闸箱轴速时，克崩即自动使曲轴与闸箱分离。这样每试一部车可省油四分之三加仑，省工四个，并减少电瓶损坏和浪费拖车现象。每修一辆车可节省六万元。今年一至五月共大修及中修车九十四辆，共节省小米五千一百多斤。大会奖予魏香山锦旗一面，小米四百斤。此外，李德全过去改装木柴炉，在减低成本方面起一定作用，奖给小米四百斤。李治平帮助提高工人技术，对改进木柴炉也有很大贡献，奖小米四百斤。铁工沈耳，创造了一套“法兰冲子”，用此“冲子”作“法兰盘”，提高了质量，减少了工时，节省了小米七百余斤，奖小米五十斤。
    事务方面受奖者计有二十六部车，受奖司机、售票员共一百七十人。十一位模范工作者受到表扬，有的并颁发了奖章。
    工业局贾庭三副局长在大会上说：公共汽车公司从原来五辆车发展到现在的一百五十辆；从每月一万乘客发展到现在的一百一十一万人，这是全体职工努力的结果。他并勉励得奖者不要骄傲，再创纪录；未得奖者要迎头赶上，争取下期当英雄模范。
    朱临同志最后宣布，他决定从一万斤小米中，拿出五千斤作为工会福利基金；以一千五百斤奖给今后对“五一煤气炉”进一步改进者；以五百斤奖给最初试用该式煤气炉的司机李仲贤和高峰。
    又，此次发奖前，工会曾发动工会小组讨论受奖人及受奖条件等，并根据工人意见加以修正，因此，比第一次奖励更为合理。此外，修理厂中修理部因平时对工作成绩没有详细记载，故未能选出模范工作者。
