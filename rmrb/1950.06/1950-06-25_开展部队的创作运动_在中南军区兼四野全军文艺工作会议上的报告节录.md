Launching a Creative Movement in the Troops
--Excerpts from a Report at the Literary and Art Work Conference of the Central and Southern Military Region and the Entire 4th Field Army
Chen Huangmei

    To launch a literary and art movement in the troops is to educate the troops with a high degree of revolutionary spirit and patriotism through the form of literature and art. Therefore, the achievements and effects of the literary and art movement in the troops, from the perspective of the troops, are manifested in the enthusiasm for consciously implementing various military and political tasks, the consolidation and unity of the troops, and the activity and fullness of emotions (of course, it must be stated that the above is a reflection of the achievements and effects obtained by all political work; literary and art work can only play a part, but its role is sometimes considerable). From the perspective of literary and art work, it depends on whether the company-level literary and art movement is carried out well, whether backbones have been cultivated, and whether company-level cultural and entertainment organizations have been established as regular and solid organizations; on the other hand, it depends on how many works that correctly reflect the life of the troops have been produced. One point should be affirmed: without creation, it is difficult to comprehensively assess the achievements and effects of this movement, and it is also difficult to understand the depth and impact of the movement.

    Because our troops' literary and art movement has clear political requirements and content, and in order to educate and improve the troops, it is necessary to require the production of educational creations. Only with such creations can the literary and art movement have rich content, and can the literary and art movement be enriched and improved. Without such creations, it is more difficult for the literary and art movement to continue to move forward, and it is also easy to stagnate or decline.

    Therefore, we must all attach importance to this issue ideologically. If we want to launch the literary and art movement of our entire army, we must advocate and reward creation in a planned and organized manner. Ignoring creation, not requiring creation from literary and art workers, not encouraging cultural troupes and propaganda teams to take action and create collectively, and not listing creation as one of the main tasks of literary and art work is a completely intolerable mistake! This is equivalent to asking soldiers to actively fight, but allowing them to put down their weapons and let them rust there.

    In order to launch the creation movement of the entire army, the Political Department of the 4th Field Army has decided to establish the "August 1st" Literary and Art Creation Award this year to reward various excellent creations, including news reports, dramas, music, novels, poems, and various fine arts creations. At the same time, we are strengthening the publishing work of literary and art aspects of the troops. At the same time, we put forward the following requirements to the propaganda departments at all levels:

    1. Propaganda departments at all levels should frequently and timely mobilize, organize, and reward creation, paying special attention to rewarding the creation of soldiers and the masses; and lead literary and art sections, cultural troupes, and propaganda teams to conduct research and summaries of creation work, and strengthen ideological leadership of creation. Good creations should be collected and sent to the Literary and Art Work Committee of the Propaganda Department of the Political Department of the 4th Field Army in a timely manner.

    2. Appropriately concentrate comrades engaged in creation, and cultivate them in a planned and led manner: give them time and various conditions and conveniences needed for creation, help them collect, study, and organize materials; be good at enlightening the creators' thoughts, and absorb them to participate in certain political work meetings, understand the situation in advance, understand the current political tasks and requirements, as well as the intentions of the leadership, and then stipulate the creation tasks.

    3. It is required that the cultural troupes of each corps, military region, and army gradually achieve in the future that at least ten short plays suitable for performances by divisional and regimental propaganda teams, a multi-act drama or opera, and ten songs can be produced each year. Each division and regimental propaganda team should also produce at least ten short plays suitable for performances by regiments and companies each year, as well as ten songs. And actively help, collect, participate in, and sort out the creation of soldiers. The creation of cultural troupes and propaganda teams should focus on being short, concise, and suitable for the level of soldiers, but also encourage good long works suitable for cadres; advocate writing more scripts, songs, and other singing materials, but also encourage other forms of creation.

    4. Comrades with certain creative abilities should carry out long-form creation of the epic of the Liberation War in a planned way. It is best to write an outline, conduct consultation and research, and carry out writing with the help of the leadership after approval.

    Secondly, regarding the creation aspect, I will only raise some ideological issues to discuss.

    What to write? Do our comrades engaged in creation have a clear understanding of this point ideologically? I don't think the understanding is very clear. Judging from the creation I have seen, there is not enough expression of the most excellent feelings and qualities of countless commanders and fighters in our troops, and the heroic spirit and great character of the new heroes who have lofty ideals, are full of optimism and confidence, can overcome all difficulties, are invincible, courageous, advance bravely, and sacrifice blood. Speaking in terms of ideology, this is a serious shortcoming in our creation.

    Chairman Mao instructed us to write about workers, peasants, and soldiers, saying, "What we write should unite them, make them progress, make them of one heart and one mind, and struggle forward, remove backward things, and promote revolutionary things, and never the opposite." And he repeatedly emphasized that we should sing praises of the revolutionary struggle of the people's masses.

    Zhdanov also said: "To show these new lofty qualities of the Soviet people, not only to show our people today, but also to look forward to his tomorrow, and to illuminate the way forward with a searchlight - this is the task of every conscientious Soviet writer."

    From the criticism and works of Soviet literature and art, we can see that there is a strong spirit of patriotism, and that there is such an enthusiastic demand for expressing the excellent typicals of Soviet society and Soviet people.

    The problem is very clear. We should and must write about the most excellent feelings and qualities of the commanders and fighters in our people's army, and the typical characters with this noble quality. However, we have written too little in the past, and although we have written, we have not written well enough. Perhaps not every comrade engaged in creation has fully understood this problem ideologically.

    As early as 1936, Chairman Mao wrote in "Strategic Issues of China's Revolutionary War": "The banner of China's revolutionary war is the banner of saving China. The war waged by the majority of mankind and the majority of China is undoubtedly a sacred war, a just war, a supreme glorious undertaking to save mankind and save China from destruction, a bridge to turn the entire history to a new era, and a lighthouse to turn the entire earth into a new world." He also said: "The Chinese Communist Party has led and continues to lead the vigorous, glorious, and victorious revolutionary war. This war is not only the banner of liberating China, but also has international revolutionary significance. The revolutionary people of the world are all watching us." What a great prediction! Now the victory of the Chinese revolution—which is primarily determined by our revolutionary army's destruction of millions of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary armed forces supported by US imperialism in the three-year Liberation War—has been fully confirmed.

    From the first day of its birth, this army has stood closely with the people, loved the people, and been loyal to the revolution. No matter how difficult the environment, it has shown unparalleled bravery and tenacity, and has been able to win countless victories in combat, rectification, and production. Only such an army can acquire a good work style and tradition of courage, hard work, and endurance. Such an army has been maturedly established with a complete set of political work system because of the leadership of our Party. Such an army has also grown countless military and political cadres who have experienced Chairman Mao's strategic thinking and have fully learned to master the art of revolutionary warfare in more than 20 years of revolutionary war. Only such an army can have emerged countless new heroic figures that have never appeared in history in every battle.

    Many of our comrades yearn to write great works. What exactly are great works? I think that the great works that literary and art workers in the troops want to write lie in their ability to educate the troops: what kind of army were we originally, and what kind of army should we become? The greatness of literary and artistic creation lies in expressing people, expressing that era and society through expressing people, and in turn educating the people and young people: how should a person struggle to build a people's country, and how many arduous roads have the past struggles gone through! In other words, where should people go? The literature and art of our troops should be about the noble feelings and qualities shown by our People's Liberation Army in the revolutionary war, mainly about the outstanding figures in the People's Liberation Army, about their positive side, about how they wholeheartedly serve the people; using this to educate the troops, this is a good example of the People's Liberation Army, an example that everyone should learn, the best army and the People's Liberation Army should do this, this is the great creation needed in our troops.

    We literary and art workers, creators, directors, actors, composers, painters, every comrade should examine themselves ideologically, we should feel that: although we have experienced war, we have not yet clearly defined this idea, mainly to show the most progressive, active and excellent aspects of our troops, or written, written too little, or written our heroes not real and vivid enough, written in concepts. This is a serious problem. We should feel ashamed. For example, no matter which battle, the proportion of our Party members in the casualty statistics is very large. Let us imagine, why shouldn't these people be the protagonists of our works? Why are they not vivid when they appear in the works? Why do we often put these figures in a secondary position? The noble qualities of these people have a positive educational significance, why do we often love to write about the transformation of backward elements? (Of course, it is not to say that such works have no educational significance and cannot be written at all).

    This shows that the main advancing and active heroic figures who have been tempered and grown up in the army in the 20-year revolutionary war have not received the due attention and familiarity of the literary and art workers in our troops. This has to be said to be a serious shortcoming in our creative work and deserves everyone's vigilance.

    In this regard, we should learn well from Soviet literary and art workers. Most of the many good works produced in the Soviet patriotic war are mainly about the active and brave commanders and fighters in the Soviet army. We should also learn from Comrade Liu Baiyu. His collection of short stories "Battle Fires" gives us a lot of inspiration. His works mainly write about the heroic figures of the troops. He is full of optimism, joy, and enthusiastic praise for the figures he writes about.

    Precisely because we want to promote writing about heroic deeds and figures in the troops, and write about the positive aspects of the troops, I feel that it should also be pointed out that our past creations about the history of the troops, about the military and political cadres, about the embodiment of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking in our troops, about our political work, etc., these aspects have not been written enough. If we cannot start from these aspects, and cannot well reflect these aspects, it will be difficult to write about the positive aspects of our troops, and it will not be comprehensive enough, so the ideology of the works will be poor.

    For example, the history of our troops, any troop has its process of growth in struggle and its historical tradition, and therefore develops a good work style. Often the title of "Iron Company" and "Heroic Regiment" can permanently maintain the heroic combat style and tradition of this company and regiment, because the commanders and fighters (even if there are many new components) cherish and value the glorious history of this unit, and the educational significance of this troop history is very great for the troops.

    For example, the cadres of our army, many cadres, some from the Red Army era, some from the War of Resistance, grew from soldiers to commanders, from guerrilla warfare to mastering large-scale mobile warfare with modern weapons, especially some cadres of the Fourth Field Army who fought out of the Soviet area of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, and returned after more than 20 years of revolutionary war. Their personal history is inseparable from the history of China's revolutionary war, and their history is also the history of the growth of our troops. Moreover, it should be recognized that without these battle-tested, loyal, and dedicated army cadres who have dedicated their lives to the revolution and mastered the art of revolutionary warfare, there would be no victory today!

    A series of political work in our army, which shows the strong leadership of the Party, is the soul of our army. Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, without Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu building the system and tradition of our army's political work from the beginning of the founding of the Red Army, there would be no such immensely powerful, heroic, and flesh-and-blood People's Liberation Army today! In the past, many of our creations reflected the mobilization, grievance, education, and the exemplary role of the Party's branches and members in the war in the political work of the Liberation War, but the requirement to be able to show the leading role of the systematic and complete political work from bottom to top in the war is not enough.

    As for writing about Chairman Mao's strategic thinking, writing about several important historical turning points in the Liberation War, writing about how our troops won victories under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great strategic thinking, writing about how our generals understood Chairman Mao's strategic thinking and were good at mastering and applying the art of revolutionary warfare, writing about how our troops resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, and established the idea of being an eternal combat team, a production team, and a work team,... these are even less reflected in our creations.

    If our creations reach the level mentioned above, our creations will shine with a kind of brilliance--that is, the lofty ideal of revolution and communism that our troops have held for a long time in such a long history. Without this revolutionary lofty ideal, the arduousness, courage, and growing struggle of our troops would become an unimaginable miracle.

    In general, we demand to write about the glorious history and tradition of our troops, the role of political work led by the Party, Chairman Mao's strategic thinking and cadres under the guidance of this thinking, and the good models of thousands of commanders and fighters with lofty revolutionary ideals who can follow one another, bravely sacrifice for the people, for the revolution, and for the country. To repeat, the main thing is to write about the excellent feelings and qualities of this type of good model. We should use such creations to conduct patriotic education for the troops.

    The content of this creation is very rich, and it is also necessary to write about the outstanding models of troops becoming localized, taking on the task of work teams, in suppressing bandits, reducing rent and anti-hegemony, and mobilizing the masses, write about the active models of building the national defense army in rectification and production, write about some of the typicals who were demobilized and participated in national construction, write about the typicals of many guerrilla teams who persisted in the Soviet area until now; and also write about the good typicals of our military families in the rear, and various aspects, to implement the ideological education of patriotism.

    Is it too high to make such demands on literary and art workers in the troops? It is not high. We must work hard in this direction. Do our best to do it; just like a miner, regardless of how much strength he has, he should understand how rich and deep the entire mineral layer is.

　　开展部队的创作运动
    ——在中南军区兼四野全军文艺工作会议上的报告节录
    陈荒煤
    开展部队文艺运动，是为了通过文艺的形式，给部队以高度的革命精神和爱国精神的教育。所以，部队文艺运动的成绩和效果，从部队方面来看，是表现在自觉执行各项军政任务的积极性，部队的巩固与团结，情绪的活跃与饱满（当然，一定要说明：以上所表现的是全部政治工作所获得的成绩与效果；文艺工作只能起一部分作用，但其作用有时是相当大的），从文艺工作来看，就要看连队文艺运动是否开展得好，是否培养了骨干，建立了连队文娱组织，成为经常性巩固的组织；另一方面就要看产生了多少正确反映部队生活的作品，应该肯定一点；没有创作就很难全面的估计这个运动的成绩和效果，也很难了解运动深入的程度和影响。
    因为，我们部队文艺运动既然有明确的政治要求和内容，为了教育和提高部队，那么，就不能不要求产生有教育意义的创作，有了这样的创作，文艺运动才能有丰富的内容，文艺运动才能得到充实和提高，没有这样的创作，文艺运动继续前进，就比较困难，也容易停滞或消沉。
    因此，我们大家要在思想上重视这个问题。如果要开展我们全军的文艺运动，就必须有计划有组织地提倡与奖励创作。忽视创作，对文艺工作者不要求创作，不鼓励文工团宣传队大家动手，集体创作，不把创作列为文艺工作之主要任务之一，是完全不能容忍的错误！这等于要求战士积极作战，却容许他搁下武器在那里生锈一样。
    四野政治部为了开展全军的创作运动，已经决定今年开始设立“八一”文艺创作奖金，奖励各种优秀的创作，包括通讯报告，戏剧音乐、小说诗歌，以及各种美术创作。并加强部队文艺方面的出版工作。同时，我们向各级宣传部提出以下几点要求：
    １．各级宣传部要经常和及时地发动组织和奖励创作，特别注意奖励战士群众的创作；并领导文艺科、文工团和宣传队进行创作工作的研究与总结，加强创作的思想领导。有好的创作要及时搜集寄交四野政治部宣传部文艺工作委员会。
    ２．适当地集中搞创作的同志，有计划有领导地予以培养：要给以时间和一定的创作所需要的各种条件和便利，要帮助搜集、研究、组织材料；要善于启发创作者的思想，吸收他们参加一定的政治工作会议，预先了解情况，懂得当前政治任务和要求，以及领导上的意图，然后再规定创作任务。
    ３．要求各兵团、各军区、各军文工团今后逐步作到，每年至少能产生十个短小的适合师团宣传队演出的剧本，一个多幕话剧或歌剧以及十个歌曲，每个师和团宣传队每年也至少产生十个短小适合团连演出的剧本，以及十个歌曲。并且要积极帮助、收集、参加、整理战士的创作。文工团宣传队的创作以短小精悍，适合战士水平为主，但同时也鼓励适合于干部的好的长篇创作；提倡多写剧本、歌曲及其他演唱材料，但也鼓励其他形式的创作。
    ４．有一定创作能力的同志，有计划地进行解放战争史诗的长篇创作，最好写出提纲经过商研，经领导上同意予以帮助下进行写作。
    其次，关于创作方面，我只提出一些思想问题来谈谈。
    写什么？我们搞创作的同志是否在思想上都很明确地认识到这一点呢？我觉得认识还不很明确。就我所看到的创作来讲，表现我们部队方面无数指战员最优秀的感情和品质，表现那种有崇高理想，充满乐观和信心，能克服一切困难，战无不胜，勇往直前，牺牲流血的新英雄的气概和伟大性格都很不够。提到思想方面来谈，这是我们创作中一个严重的缺点。
    毛主席指示我们，要写工农兵，说“我们所写的东西，应该是使他们团结，使他们进步，使他们同心同德，向前奋斗，去掉落后的东西，发挥革命的东西，而决不是相反。”又一再强调指出，我们应该歌颂赞扬人民群众的革命斗争。
    日丹诺夫也讲过这样的话：“表现苏联人民的这些新的崇高的品质，不但表现我们人民的今天，而且还展望他的明天，用探照灯照亮前进的道路——这就是每个有良心的苏联作家的任务。”
    从苏联文艺的批评和作品中，我们都可以看到有一种强烈的爱国主义的精神，那样热情地要求着表现苏维埃社会和苏维埃人的优秀典型。
    问题很清楚，我们应该也一定要写出我们这支人民军队中指战员中最优良的感情和品质，和具有这种崇高品质的典型人物。但我们过去写得太少，写了但是写得不够好。每个搞创作的同志恐怕没有全部在思想上认识这一个问题。
    毛主席早在一九三六年写的《中国革命战争的战略问题》中，曾写道：“中国革命战争的旗帜，是拯救中国的旗帜。人类大多数与中国大多数举行的战争，毫无疑义的是神圣战争，是正义战，是拯救人类拯救中国出于毁灭的至高无上的荣誉的事业，是把全历史转到新时代的桥梁，是把全地球翻成新世界的灯塔。”又说：“中国共产党领导了、而且继续领导着轰轰烈烈光荣胜利的革命战争，这个战争不但是解放中国的旗帜，而且是具备了国际革命的意义的，世界的革命人民都把眼睛望着我们。”多么伟大的预言啊！现在中国革命的胜利——这首先决定于我们这支革命军队在三年多解放战争中摧毁了美帝支持下的几百万蒋介石的反动武装——已经完全得到证实了。
    这一支军队从他诞生的第一天开始，就紧紧和人民站在一起，热爱人民，忠于革命，无论在任何坚苦困难的环境，都表现得无比的英勇和顽强，在作战、整训、生产中都同样能获得无数次胜利。只有这样的军队才能获得一种勇敢刻苦耐劳的优良作风和传统。这样的军队，是因为有我们党的领导，成熟地建立了一套完整的政治工作制度。这样的军队，也生长了无数体验毛主席战略思想，完全在二十多年革命战争中学会了掌握革命战争艺术的军政干部。也只有这样的军队，才能在每次战斗中涌现了无数历史上从来所没有的新的英雄人物。
    我们有很多同志向往着写出伟大的作品来，倒底什么是伟大的作品呢？我想，部队文艺工作者要写的伟大的作品，就是在于能教育部队：我们原来是一个什么样的军队，应该成为一个什么样的军队。文艺创作的伟大，就是表现人，通过表现人来表现那个时代和社会，又反转来教育人民和青年：一个人应该如何为建设一个人民的国家而斗争，过去的斗争又经历了多少艰苦的道路啊！换句话说，人应该走向那里。我们部队的文艺，就应该是写我们解放军在革命战争中所表现的崇高的感情和品质，主要写解放军中的优秀人物，写他们的积极面，写他们如何全心全意为人民服务；用这来教育部队，这就是解放军的好的榜样，每个人应该学习的榜样，一个最好的军队和解放军人应该这样作，这就是我们部队中所需要的伟大创作。
    我们文艺工作者，创作者、导演、演员、作曲者、画家们每一个同志都应该在思想上检查自己，我们应该感到：我们虽然经历了战争，但还没有明确这个思想，主要要表现我部队最进步，积极和优秀的方面，或者写了，写得不多，或者把我们的英雄写得不够真实和生动，写得概念。这是一个严重的问题。我们应该感到羞耻。举个例子来说，无论那一次战役中的伤亡统计中，我们党员的比例数字都是很大的。我们试想一下，为什么这些人不应该是我们作品中的主人翁呢？为什么他们出现在作品中就不生动呢？为什么我们还常常把这些人物放到次要的地位去呢？这些人的崇高品质就具有积极的教育意义，为什么我们还常常喜爱写落后分子的转变呢？（当然，不是说，这样的作品没有教育意义，根本不能写）。
    这说明：我们军队在二十多年革命战争中锻炼和成长起来的，已经形成部队中主要的前进的积极的英雄人物，还没有得到我们部队文艺工作者应有的重视和熟悉。这不能不说是我们创作工作中的一个严重缺点，值得大家警惕。
    这方面我们应该很好地向苏联文艺工作者学习，在苏联爱国战争中所产生的许许多多好的作品，绝大部分主要是写苏联军队中积极勇敢的指战员的。我们也应该向刘白羽同志学习，他的《战火纷飞》短篇集给我们不少的启发，他的作品主要是写部队的英勇人物，对他所写的这些人物，他充满着一种乐观的、喜悦的、热情的歌颂。
    正因为我们要提倡写作部队中英雄事迹和人物，写部队的积极方面，我觉得还应该指出，我们过去的创作写部队的历史，写军政的干部，写毛主席战略思想在我部队方面的体现，写我们的政治工作等，这些方面都还写得不够，不能从这几方面着手，不能很好地反映这些方面，也就很难写出我们部队的积极方面来，也就不够全面，因之作品的思想性也就差了。
    比如，我们部队的历史，任何一支部队都有它在斗争中生长的过程及其历史传统，也就因此养成一种优良的作风。常常有一个“钢铁连”、“英雄团”的称号可以永远保持这个连、团英勇作战作风和传统，就因为指战员（那怕是有很多新的成分）爱护和重视这部队的光荣历史，这种部队历史对部队的教育意义是很大的。
    比如我们军队干部，许多干部有的从红军时代，有的从抗战开始，从战士成长为指挥员，从打游击战到掌握近代化武器的大规模运动战，特别是四野有些干部是从江西湖南湖北苏区打出去，经过二十多年革命战争又打回来的，他们个人的历史和中国革命战争历史分不开，他们的历史也就是我们部队成长的历史。而且，应该认识到：没有这些身经百战，忠心耿耿，将一生都贡献给革命的掌握了革命战争艺术的军队干部，就不可能有今天的胜利！
    我们军队的一系列的政治工作，表现着党的坚强领导，这是我们军队的灵魂。如果没有中国共产党的领导，没有毛主席朱总司令在创立红军开始就建设了我军政治工作的制度和传统，就没有今天这样壮大无比、英勇的、和人民血肉相连的解放军！我们过去有不少创作反映了解放战争政治工作中的动员、诉苦、教育以及党的支部及党员在战争中的鼓动模范作用，但是要求能表现出在战争中自下而上成为系统的完整的政治工作的领导作用则不够。
    至于写毛主席的战略思想，写解放战争中几个重要的历史转折点，写我们部队如何在毛主席伟大的战略思想指导之下赢得胜利，写我们将领如何体会了毛主席的战略思想而善于掌握和运用革命战争的艺术，写我们部队如何坚决执行毛主席的指示，建立永远的战斗队，又是生产队，又是工作队的思想，……在我们创作中就反映得更少更少了。
    如果我们的创作达到以上所说的水平，我们的创作才会闪耀着一种光芒——这就是我们部队在这样长久历史中对革命、对共产主义抱有崇高的理想。没有这种革命的崇高理想，我们部队的那种坚苦、勇敢、成长的斗争情形，就成为不可想像的奇迹。
    总的来说，我们要求写我们部队的光荣的历史和传统，党所领导的政治工作的作用，毛主席的战略思想以及在这种思想指导下的干部，以及千千万万有崇高革命理想因而能为人民、为革命、为国家前仆后继、英勇牺牲的指战员们的好的典型。再重复地说一句，主要的要写这一类好的典型的优秀感情和品质。我们应该以这样的创作来对部队进行爱国主义的教育。
    这个创作的内容是非常丰富的，还要写部队地方化，担任工作队任务，在剿匪、减租反霸，发动群众的优秀典型，写建设国防军在整训生产中的积极典型，写一部分复原参加国家建设的典型，写许多坚持苏区到现在的游击队的典型；还要写我们军属在后方生活等、各方面好的典型，来贯彻爱国主义的思想教育。
    对部队文艺工作者提出这样的要求是不是太高呢？是不高的。我们必需朝这方面努力。尽我们的力量去作；好像一个采矿的人一样，固不论自己有多少力量，但应该了解全部的矿层有多么丰富和深厚。
