Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd:

    Speech by Uprising General Pei Changhui, specially invited to attend the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:
    Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, esteemed members, ladies and gentlemen:
    I am very excited to be here in Beijing as a delegate to the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I have studied the reports presented by various departments and the various documents of the conference, and I have received many valuable insights and understandings.
    Thanks to the correct leadership of the people's leader, Chairman Mao, and the long-term heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the people's revolutionary cause has been basically victorious. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, in a very short period, we have curbed inflation and stabilized prices in finance and economy. In particular, the land reform policy has eliminated the obstacles to productivity caused by the feudal land ownership system in China for thousands of years and has freed the oppressed and exploited working masses from poverty, backwardness, and shackles, paving the way for the industrialization of the new China. This is exactly in line with the interests and demands of the broad masses of the people, and I absolutely support and resolutely implement it.
    I am very ashamed that I have always been dominated by old ideas in the old society. When the War of Resistance Against Japan was about to end, I was transferred to Hu Zongnan as an assistant in Chiang Kai-shek's direct line of reactionary group. In the spring of 1947, I attacked Yan'an with Hu Zongnan, and I became an accomplice to them in opposing the Communist Party and the people, committing serious crimes. Looking back, this was my biggest mistake, and I should confess my guilt to the people. At the same time, during that period, seeing the troops destroy, burn, kill, rape, loot, arrest soldiers, and drag laborers, trampling on the people of more than a dozen counties in northern Shaanxi, I deeply felt the counter-revolutionary and anti-people atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government and Chiang Hu's reactionary army, which accelerated the demise of the Chiang Hu bandit gang. I was unwilling to aggravate my sins, and only by standing with the people to fight could I follow the correct path. However, because the troops were all directly controlled by Hu Zongnan, and there were special agents everywhere, I did not have enough courage to take practical action for a while. Until last winter, before Hu Zongnan fled from the outskirts of Chengdu, he gave me a series of reactionary orders, asking me to carry out blocking battles and then conduct guerrilla warfare by district. There was also a telegram saying: "This battle has completely failed. We have become revolutionaries and sinners, and there is still much to be done in coordination with the international situation." This telegram proves that the Chiang Hu bandit gang colluded with imperialism to stop the people's revolution and that the crime of slaughtering the Chinese people was not big enough. They wanted to turn China into a colony of American imperialism, and they still used this kind of traitorous act to fool and deceive people. We had already seen through this trick and hated it to the extreme. He said that failure in combat would make us revolutionary sinners. Of course, we admit that what we have done against the Communist Party and the people makes us sinners. The faster the battle fails, the sooner we can stop continuing to act evilly and no longer aggravate the damage to the people. In order to strive for self-service, I immediately broke away from the reactionary rule and called on the troops under my command in northern and western Sichuan to stop fighting and accept the orders of the southward army commanded by General He Long, and mutiny on the spot.
    Since the uprising, I have returned the troops under my command from the reactionary camp to the people, and I have received the generous tolerance of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the broad masses of the people, allowing us to forever escape the darkness and find the light. Thanks to the guidance and assistance of the Second Working Group dispatched by the Southwest Military Region to the troops, after more than four months of study and transformation, a democratic movement was launched in the troops, gradually consolidating the troops, strengthening mass discipline, and generally improving the ideology of officers and soldiers. We also transformed ourselves through labor practice in suppressing bandits, repairing roads, building dams, assisting people in production, and cultivating wasteland and growing vegetables to save money. However, after the exposure, we know that there are still some serious problems, and we deeply realize that all the previous sins harmed the people. We must start from scratch, learn from scratch, transform and progress, and eliminate all the old ideas and bad habits from the past in order to serve the people. At the same time, under the great spirit of the leaders of the People's Liberation Army military region who are responsible for taking care of the uprising troops, treating people with kindness, and healing and saving lives, we have also strengthened the desire of all officers and soldiers to strive for progress. After the transformation is completed, we must resolutely accept the instructions in the military report of Acting Chief of the General Staff Nie, under the command of the People's Government and under the leadership of the Southwest Military and Political leaders, and we are willing to stand on the most difficult, the most difficult, and the foremost line of battle missions or production and construction work, and be the most loyal people's fighters and service personnel. Finally, I shout: Celebrate the success of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference! Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

    特邀列席起义将领
    裴昌会的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】起义将领裴昌会在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，文如下：主席、副主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    我这次来京列席人民政协全国委员会第一届第二次会议，学习了各部门提出的报告和大会的各种文件，又接受了很多宝贵启示和体认，感觉万分兴奋。
    由于人民领袖毛主席的正确领导，及中国人民解放军长期英勇奋斗，人民革命事业已经基本上胜利完成。自从中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立以后，很短过程中，在财政经济上制止了通货膨胀，稳定了物价，特别是土改政策，是扫除中国几千年来封建土地所有制对生产力的障碍，和解脱被压迫剥削劳动大众贫苦落后的桎梏，为新中国的工业化开辟道路，这正符合了广大人民的利益和要求，我是绝对拥护和坚决执行的。
    我很惭愧，在旧社会中一直被旧思想支配着。在抗战将要结束时又被调到蒋介石嫡系的反动集团给胡宗南当了副手。一九四七年春同胡宗南进攻延安，给他们当了反共反人民的帮凶，铸成严重罪恶。回想起来，这是我最大的错误，应当向人民认罪的。同时在那个期间，看到部队破坏、烧杀、奸淫，掳掠、抓兵、拉夫，蹂躏了陕北十几个县的人民，我深深感觉到蒋介石反动政府和蒋胡反动军队的反革命反人民暴行，更加速蒋胡匪帮的灭亡。我既不愿加重自己的罪恶，只有站到人民一起去奋斗，才是正确的大道。但是因为部队都归胡宗南直接掌握，特务密布，一时又没有足够的勇气采取实际行动。直到去冬在成都外围胡宗南逃走之前还给我下了一连串反动命令，叫我实施阻击战斗后再分区进行游击。又有电报说：“此次作战全般失败，我们已成革命罪人，以后配合国际情势，仍大有可为”。就在这个电报里面证明蒋胡匪帮勾结帝国主义阻止人民革命，屠杀中国人民的罪行还觉着不够大，他们想把中国变成美帝国主义的殖民地，还拿这种卖国勾当来唬人、欺骗人，这种把戏我们早已看穿，痛恨到极点了。他说作战失败就成了革命罪人，当然，我们承认所做反共反人民的事情就是罪人，作战失败的快，倒可以终止我们继续反动作恶，不再加重人民的损害。为争取自效，我即时脱离了反动统治，并号召蒋胡在川北、川西曾经我指挥过的部队停止战斗，接受贺龙将军统帅的南下大军的命令，就地起义。
    自起义后，已将所属部队从反动阵营交还给人民，并得到毛主席、朱总司令，以及广大人民的宽大优容，使我们永远脱离了黑暗，找到了光明。由于西南军区派遣第二工作团到部队指导并帮助，经过四个多月的学习改造，展开了部队中的民主运动，逐渐巩固了部队，加强了群众纪律，一般官兵在思想上提高了一步。也在剿匪、修路、筑坝、协助人民生产、以及自己开荒种菜、节约等，从劳动实践中改造了自己。但经过揭发后，知道仍还存在着一些严重问题，并深切认识到以前种种罪恶都是危害人民的，必须从头学起，从学习中再改造进步，脱胎换骨的把从前旧思想坏习气消除净尽，才能做到为人民服务。同时我们在人民解放军军区首长们对起义部队负责照顾，与人为善、治病救人的伟大精神感召下，也更坚定了全体官兵争取进步的愿望。在改造完成以后，我们要坚决在人民政府的指挥、和西南军政首长的领导下，接受聂代总长军事报告中的提示，愿在战斗任务，或生产建设工作上，站在最艰难最困苦的最前哨，做一个最忠实的人民战士和勤务员。最后我高呼庆祝人民政协全国委员会议成功！中华人民共和国万岁！毛主席、朱总司令万岁！
