　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, in order to lead and support the wool and linen industry in a planned way, to improve management, and to restore and develop production, convened a wool and linen textile conference on the 1st of this month, which closed on the 9th. A total of forty-six factory directors, managers, and trade union representatives from public and private wool and linen industries from various regions attended the meeting. Representatives from relevant departments such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the People's Bank, the Ministry of Trade, and the National Textile Workers' Union also participated. At the meeting, representatives from various regions reported on the equipment, production, and management of their factories. The Ministry of Agriculture reported on issues such as improving the quality and increasing the production of wool and linen. Representatives from the wool and linen industries also discussed in detail the issues of raw material supply and product sales. Discussions were held on the relationship between public and private sectors and labor-management relations. During the meeting, Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Textile Workers' Union, made a detailed speech on labor-management relations issues.

　　The meeting pointed out that the current difficulties in the wool textile industry are mainly due to the fact that raw materials have always relied on foreign supply, and most manufacturers cannot even directly use raw wool, but must import wool tops from abroad before they can be processed into woolen fabrics. The wool textile industry is more semi-colonial than other textile industries. At the same time, most consumers of woolen fabrics are upper-class people in cities, which does not meet the needs of the general public, resulting in poor sales. Therefore, the future of the wool weaving industry must turn to the path of mass production and industrial use of woolen fabrics in order to develop. Under the current circumstances, only factories with complete equipment, high technical standards, and better conditions can be maintained as much as possible. The meeting also discussed and made decisions on the methods of maintenance, which stipulated that those who produce finished products that can be exported can apply for importing wool tops for processing and exporting finished products duty-free. Domestic wool should mainly supply domestic needs, and the surplus part should be exported abroad.

　　As for the linen textile industry, the meeting believed that the country has both raw materials and a vast market, and can develop in a planned way. Before the new hemp is on the market in 1950, production can be carried out according to the amount of hemp in stock; after the new hemp is on the market, production can be appropriately expanded according to plan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government held a national conference on machinery and materials for the cotton, wool, linen, printing, and dyeing industries on the 10th. More than forty representatives and consultants from public and private factories from various regions attended the meeting. This meeting will be divided into groups to discuss unified numbering, unified classification, unified names, unified specifications and units, as well as the amount of demand and storage methods, and formulate specific plans. The meeting is expected to end in early July.

　　纺织工业部召开毛麻纺织会议
    讨论毛麻工业生产问题         
    棉毛麻等业机物料会议亦揭幕
    【新华社十日讯】中央人民政府纺织工业部为有计划地领导与扶持毛、麻工业改善经营，恢复与发展生产，于本月一日召开毛、麻纺织会议，该会已于九日闭幕。到会有各地毛、麻工业公、私营厂长、经理及工会代表共四十六人。农业部、人民银行、贸易部、全国纺织工会等有关部门，亦派代表参加。会上各地代表报告了工厂设备、生产和经营情况。农业部报告了关于改良羊毛与麻的品质、增产诸问题。毛、麻业代表并分别详尽地讨论了原料的供应和成品的销路问题。对公私关系和劳资关系问题，进行了座谈。会间全国纺织工会陈少敏主席，对劳资关系问题曾作了详细的发言。
    会议指出，目前毛纺织业的困难，主要是原料一向依靠外国供给，极大部分的厂家甚至不能直接利用原毛，而必须从国外输入毛条，然后才能加工制成呢绒，毛纺织业较之其他纺织工业，更富于半殖民地性。同时，大部分毛织品的消费者，又是城市的上层人物，不适应人民大众的需要，销路困难。因此，今后的毛织业必需转向大众化及工业用呢的途径，以求发展。在目前情况下，对毛纺工业只能尽可能地维持设备齐全、技术较高等条件较好的工厂。关于维持的办法，会议亦作了讨论，并作出了决定，其中规定：凡生产成品而能出口的，可以申请进口毛条加工，免税出口成品。国内的羊毛，主要应该供给国内的需要，就其有余部分输出国外。
    至于麻纺织业，会议认为本国既有原料，又有广大的市场，可以有计划地发展。在一九五○年新麻上市以前，可按存麻数量生产；新麻上市之后，可以照计划适当扩大生产。
    【新华社十日讯】中央人民政府纺织工业部于十日举行全国棉、毛、麻、印染等业的机物料会议，到会各地公、私营厂的代表及顾问共四十余人。这次会议将分组讨论统一编号、统一分类、统一名称、统一规格和单位以及需用量及保管方法等问题，并拟定出具体方案。该会议预计在七月上旬结束。
