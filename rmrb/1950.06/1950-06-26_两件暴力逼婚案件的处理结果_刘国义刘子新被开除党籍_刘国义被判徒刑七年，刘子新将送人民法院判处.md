Handling Results of the Liu Guoyi Case

The case of Liu Guoyi, a clerk from the Public Security Bureau of Hejian County, Hebei Province, who used violence to force marriage and violated human rights (details published in this journal on April 4th), has been finalized.

The Hejian County People's Court officially announced on June 5th: Liu Guoyi was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Zhang Ruixiang (village public security officer) helped Liu Guoyi force marriage and violated human rights, sentenced to two years of imprisonment, and ordered to bear 60,000 yuan for Li Xiuying's mother's medical expenses. Yu Daqiu (village militia captain) used Liu Guoyi's forced marriage opportunity to carry out revenge and assisted in violating human rights, sentenced to three months of imprisonment.

In addition, Wang Changbai, the Magistrate of Hejian County, Zhao Lianbi, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Yang Qingzeng, the Deputy Director, lacked a serious and responsible spirit towards the people and policies when handling this case. The Hebei Provincial People's Government has given them appropriate criticism and punishments.

The "Decision on Handling the Problem of Liu Guoyi's Illegal Forced Marriage and Violation of Human Rights" by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Cangxian Prefectural Committee of the CPC has been approved by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC. It pointed out that Liu Guoyi's arrogant and domineering behavior fully demonstrates that Liu Guoyi has no political consciousness and no sense of discipline. As a public security cadre, Liu Guoyi acted recklessly and knowingly violated the law. In order to achieve his personal desires, he used the people's armed forces to illegally arrest and beat the people, destroying the policies of guaranteeing human rights and freedom of marriage. This severely damaged the prestige of the People's Government and the Party among the masses and is not tolerated by the discipline of the People's Government and the Party. In order to uphold Party discipline, it was decided to expel him from the Party. In addition, it was decided to give Zhang Ruixiang the punishment of expulsion from the Party; to give Yu Daqiu the punishment of probation within the Party; and to give Yang Qingzeng a public warning.

Handling Results of the Liu Zixin Case

The case of Liu Zixin, Secretary of the Fourth District Committee of Shouzhang County, Pingyuan Province, who illegally forced marriage (details published in this journal on May 18th), has been decided by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the CPC on June 1st to expel him from the Party. The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government also ordered the Liaocheng Special Prefecture on June 18th to send Liu Zixin to the court for sentencing according to law.

The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Pingyuan Provincial Committee pointed out in its decision: "Liu Zixin had certain achievements in his work when he was the Secretary of the District Committee. However, Liu Zixin did not consider his achievements in work and the improvement of his personal position as the result of the Party's leadership and the heroic struggle of the broad masses of people. He did not consider how to work more humbly under the new victorious situation to repay the Party's training and the people's trust. Instead, he became arrogant and complacent, resulting in serious thoughts of privilege and rule. He placed himself above the people, acted arbitrarily, gradually became corrupt and degenerate, and even committed illegal forced marriage.

Liu Zixin's mistake is extremely serious. At a time when we are carrying out production and disaster relief, our Party calls on every Party member to share weal and woe with the people in the disaster areas; while Liu Zixin, as the Secretary of the District Committee, pursued personal enjoyment and disregarded the tens of thousands of disaster victims. What is even more serious is that he used deception and coercion to achieve his personal marriage goals. This not only violates government laws and infringes on human rights and freedom of marriage; but is also a feudal class of local bullies who oppress the people and exploit women. He has completely lost the basic qualities of a Communist Party member. In order to maintain the purity of the Party, it is decided to expel him from the Party and publish it in the newspaper to educate the whole Party."

　　两件暴力逼婚案件的处理结果
    刘国义刘子新被开除党籍
    刘国义被判徒刑七年，刘子新将送人民法院判处
    本刊曾先后发表了河北省河间县公安局股员刘国义逼婚案及平原省寿张县区委书记刘子新逼婚案。六月二十一日河北日报及六月十九日平原日报分别发表两案处理结果，刘国义及刘子新都受到人民政府和共产党的纪律制裁。兹将两案处理结果摘要发表如下。
            编者
    刘国义案件的处理结果
    河北省河间县公安局股员刘国义暴力逼婚、侵犯人权事件（详情已载四月四日本刊），业经最后处理。
    河间县人民法院于六月五日正式宣判：刘国义处有期徒刑七年。张瑞祥（村公安员）帮助刘国义逼婚，侵犯人权，处有期徒刑二年，并负担李秀英之母医药费六万元。于大秋（村民兵队长）借刘国义逼婚机会，进行报复，帮助侵犯人权，处有期徒刑三个月。
    此外，河间县县长王常柏、公安局长赵连璧、副局长杨庆增等人，在处理这一案件时，缺乏对人民、对政策严肃负责的精神，亦经河北省人民政府分别给以适当批评与处分。
    中共沧县地委纪律检查委员会“关于刘国义非法逼婚侵犯人权问题处理的决定”，已经中共河北省委纪律检查委员会批准。它指出：刘国义蛮横的恶霸行为，充分说明刘国义毫无政治觉悟和毫无纪律观点。刘国义身为公安干部，竟毫无顾忌，明知故犯。为达个人私欲，他竟使用人民武装，非法捕打人民，破坏保障人权与婚姻自由政策。严重的损害了人民政府和党在群众中的威信，实为人民政府和党的纪律所不容。为严肃党纪，决定开除其党籍。此外，并决定给张瑞祥以开除党籍处分；给于大秋以留党察看处分；给杨庆增以当众警告处分。
    刘子新案件的处理结果
    平原省寿张县四区区委书记刘子新非法逼婚案件（详情已载五月十八日本刊），业经中共平原省委纪律检查委员会于六月一日决定开除其党籍。平原省人民政府亦于六月十八日令聊城专署将刘子新送交法院依法判处。
    平原省委纪律检查委员会在决定中指出：“刘子新在任区委书记时，工作上曾有一定成绩。但刘子新对于工作的成就，个人位置的提高，不认为是党的领导与广大人民英勇奋斗的结果。他不考虑在新的胜利形势下，应如何更虚心工作，回答党的培养与人民的委托。反而骄傲自满，产生了严重的特权统治思想。把自己放在人民头上，作威作福，逐渐腐化堕落，竟发生非法逼婚事件。
    刘子新的错误是极端严重的。正值紧张进行生产救灾之际，我们党号召每个党员要与灾区人民同甘苦共患难；而刘子新身为区委书记，竟追逐个人享乐，置数万灾民于不顾。更严重的是用欺骗威逼手段，达到个人结婚目的。这不仅违犯政府法令，侵犯人权，侵犯婚姻自由；而且是一种封建阶级土棍恶霸压迫人民、鱼肉妇女的行为。他完全丧失了共产党员的起码条件。为了保持党的纯洁，故决定开除其党籍，并在报纸上公布，以教育全党。”
