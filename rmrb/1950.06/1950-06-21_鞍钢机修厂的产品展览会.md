　　I. In the Past, No One Was Responsible, and There Were Waste Products Everywhere
　　In the machine and casting workshops of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Repair Shop, there were many defective products in the past. The casting workshop only completed 63.8% of its production task in February, and the finished product rate was only 80%. There were defective products everywhere in the machine workshop, and no one was responsible. Workers pushed responsibility onto each other, from shifts to shifts, from machinists to fitters, and from the machine shop to the casting shop, making it impossible to count the defective products. Everyone paid no attention to defective products, and there was a phenomenon of material loss. After the team received the materials, the workers took them as they used them, and threw them away when they were damaged, and took them again after throwing them away.
　　II. Preparation Process of the Product Exhibition
　　In mid-March, when the machine shop held a production meeting, in response to the above situation, after research, it was unanimously agreed that in order to reduce defective products, it was necessary to understand the number of defective products and implement management of defective products. Gao Fumian, the leader of the machinist team and a member of the Communist Party, proposed: "I suggest holding an exhibition and taking these defective products to the exhibition at the end of the month." This proposal won everyone's approval. This proposal put forward a form of propaganda and mobilization work that was in line with the actual situation and played a key role in production.
　　Then the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of the workshop held a joint meeting, and put forward the slogan of "struggling to improve quality, reduce costs, and reduce the rate of defective products," and decided to exhibit all the defective products in April, mainly in casting and machines, and at the same time implement management of defective products. When the inspector found a defective product during inspection, he immediately put on a "tag," writing down the item, team, name, wage level, estimated price, reason, etc. Because it attracted everyone's attention, defective products gradually decreased during the preparation period. At the beginning, some workers were unhappy when they heard that their work was defective and had to be taken to the exhibition, and some were afraid that it would not look good if they were taken to the exhibition, so they secretly threw them away or buried them. But this also shows that: first, defective products have generally attracted attention, and it is no longer the idea that "good or bad doesn't matter"; second, only some very small parts can be thrown away, and large, labor-intensive jobs cannot be thrown away. Because everyone was monitoring each other, and the leaders gave timely mobilization and explanation, it was quickly corrected. In order to make a comparison between good and bad, the defective product exhibition was changed to a product exhibition, which exhibited both bad and best products. In this way, there was not only criticism but also praise, and the content of the meeting could be more substantial.
　　III. The Effect and Reflection of the Exhibition
　　The exhibition officially started on May 5th. Each product, whether good or bad, had instructions, introductions, propaganda posters, slogans, etc. In addition to defective products, there were also self-criticisms, and the content was quite substantial.
　　The staff was very satisfied with the exhibition. They said, "Who knew whether we were doing good or bad in the past? This time, we have a goal in our hearts!" Each team paid great attention to the defective products of each team. They compared them with rulers and measured them to see how much larger they were and how to start when machining. They pointed and talked, and gathered together in groups, and were holding discussions at the time. During the five-day exhibition, many workers came three or four times. After the visit, the leaders organized a forum to let everyone express their feelings about the exhibition and how to overcome defective products.
　　The workers expressed many opinions: they all believed that "good work is our goal, and bad work is a warning to us," and "we must strengthen individual responsibility in the future and prevent defective products from appearing again." They believed that the reasons why the work was not done well were mainly that the work was sloppy and the sense of responsibility was not strong; secondly, the technology was not enough; thirdly, the raw materials were not good; and fourthly, the machines and tools were not carefully inspected. Therefore, they said: "In the future, we should pay attention to our work as soldiers do on the battlefield, and not let useful things become useless things. Understand the drawings before doing them, and ask the superiors if you don't understand."
　　IV. Product Exhibition is a Powerful Tool to Improve Quality and Reduce Defective Products
　　The exhibition played a great role in promoting the improvement of product quality, the implementation of the production responsibility system, the inspection of waste, the strengthening of administrative management, the improvement of operating methods, and the change of labor attitudes. Taking the product quality of cast iron as an example, it only reached 80% in January and February; in March, due to the strengthening of leadership in administration, it reached 85% of the original quality; in April, through various propaganda and mobilization work, it reached 96.42%. In terms of the entire production task, it only completed 63.8% in February; it rose to 75.7% in March; and reached 116.2% in April, exceeding the task by 16.2%. Taking the iron bed team of the machine shop as an example, there were only two defective products out of more than 7,000 pieces of work in April. Since early May, only two defective products have appeared in the finished products of the entire machine shop. In terms of cast iron, the quality was generally only 70% - 80% during the puppet Manchuria, but now it has reached 96%, breaking the level of the puppet Manchuria and changing the conservative thinking of the workers (although this thinking has not been completely eliminated). Therefore, through the exhibition and other various propaganda and mobilization work, production has indeed been improved, and the work has been pushed forward.

### 鞍钢机修厂的产品展览会

　　鞍钢机修厂的产品展览会
    鞍山市委宣传部
    一、过去无人负责，到处是废品
    鞍钢机修厂的机器、铸造两场中，过去废品很多。铸造场二月份只完成生产任务百分之六三·八，成品率只达百分之八十。机器场的废品到处有，无人负责，工友互相推，上班和下班互相推，车工和钳工互相推，机器和铸造互相推，使废品无法统计。大家对废品不注意，并且发生丢料现象。组里把料领来后，工友们随用随拿，坏了扔了，扔了再拿。
    二、产品展览会的筹备经过
    三月中旬，机器场召开生产会议时，针对以上情况经过研究，一致认为为了减低废品，必须了解废品数，实行对废品的管理。车工班长党员高富绵提出：“我建议开个展览会，月末把这些废品拿到会上去展览展览”。这一提议博得大家的赞成。这一提议给宣传鼓动工作提出了一个切合实际情况而且对生产起了关键作用的形式来。
    接着该场党、行政、工会、青年团开了个联席会议，提出了“为提高质量、降低成本、减少废品率”而斗争的口号，决定以铸造、机器为主，将四月份废品全部展览出来，同时实行了对废品的管理。当检查员检查出坏活时，马上就拴上一个“飞子”，写上项目、组别、姓名、工薪等级、估价、原因等。因为引起了大家的注意，在筹备期间坏活即逐渐减少。开始时有的工友活做坏了，听说要拿去展览很不高兴，也有的怕拿去展览不好看，把它偷偷扔了，或埋起来了。但这也说明了：第一、坏活已普遍引起了注意，不是“好坏没有关系”的想法了；第二、扔掉的也只能是些很小的零件，大的费工的活是扔不掉的。因为人人互相监视着，加之领导上及时给以动员解释，因此，很快也就纠正了。为使好与坏之间有个比较，又将废品展览改成产品展览，既展览坏的，也展览最好的。这样，不但有了批评也有了表扬，会议内容也就能更加充实。
    三、展览会的效果与反映
    五月五日展览会正式开始。每件产品不论好坏都有说明、介绍、宣传画、标语等等。废品之外还有自我检讨，内容相当充实。
    职工们对展览会非常满意。他们说：“过去作好作赖谁知道？这回心里有个奔头了！”各班很注意各班的废品，他们拿着尺子比了又比，量了又量，到看它大了多少，车的时候该怎样下手。他们指着说着，无形中一组一组集合起来，当时就在开着讨论会。五天的展览中，好多工友竟有来三、四次之多的。参观后领导上又组织了座谈会，让大家发表对展览会的感想，以及如何克服废品的办法。
    工友们发表了很多意见：都认为“好活是我们前进的目标，坏活是我们的一个警惕”、“今后要加强个人负责制，不能再出废品”。他们认为活未做好的原因，主要是工作马虎，责任心不强；其次是技术不够；第三、原料不好；第四、对机器工具没有认真检查等。所以他们说：“今后在工作中应该像战士在战场上作战一样的注意，不让有用的东西变成无用的东西。看明白图纸再做，不明白要问上级。”
    四、产品展览会是提高质量减少废品的有力工具
    展览会对提高产品质量、贯彻生产责任制、检查浪费、加强行政管理、改善操作方法、改变劳动态度等，起了很大的推动作用。以铸铁的产品质量来说，一、二月份只达百分之八十；三月份由于行政上加强了领导，已达原定质量百分之八十五；四月份又通过了各种宣传鼓动工作，达到了百分之九六·四二。在整个生产任务上说，二月份只完成百分之六三·八；三月份上升到百分之七五·七；四月份则达到了百分之一一六·二，超过了任务百分之一六·二。以机器场的铁床班来说，四月份七千多件活中，只两件废品。五月上旬以来，整个机器场的成品中只出现两件废品。以铸铁来说，伪满时质量一般只达百分之七○——八○，现在却达到百分之九六，打破了伪满水平，改变了工人的保守思想（虽然这思想还未完全清除）。因此，通过展览会以及其他各种宣传鼓动工作，确实提高了生产，使工作向前推进了一步。（摘自六月三日东北日报）
