　　Shijiazhuang Main Private Enterprises
　　Temporary Difficulties Gradually Overcome
　　Commodity Sales Volume Increased Significantly
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] Under the support of the People's Government and state-owned enterprises, the main private industrial and commercial enterprises in Shijiazhuang City have gradually overcome difficulties such as sluggish sales of products and lack of funds. At present, the sales volume of major commodities in the city has increased significantly. Sales of iron products increased from more than 160,000 jin in March to more than 490,000 jin in May, and most of the spring inventory has been sold. The monthly sales volume of white cloth was 1,750 bolts before mid-May, and then increased to 4,152 bolts. Grain sales increased from 80,000 jin per day to about 300,000 jin, which has returned to normal sales volume. Flour sales to rural areas are over 1,000 bags per day. Farmers have already pre-ordered all of the bean cake produced by the oil pressing industry in the next eight months. The brick industry is also experiencing a supply shortage due to the need for bricks and tiles for farmers to repair their houses.
　　When the city's private industrial and commercial enterprises generally encountered difficulties, the Municipal People's Government and state-owned enterprises carried out a series of support measures. First of all, the Municipal People's Government convened various meetings with the business community, focusing on pointing out to them that the difficulties were temporary and could be completely overcome. In the stage of New Democracy, the prospects for the development of private enterprises were broad, thus initially reversing the private industrialists and businessmen's doubts about the policies of the People's Government and enhancing their confidence in management. Around mid-May, state-owned enterprises purchased agricultural products worth 39 billion yuan, which greatly increased farmers' purchasing power and created favorable conditions for the sales of private enterprises' products. At the same time, state-owned enterprises also supported private enterprises through entrusted processing and ordering. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company continued to provide entrusted processing support to Daxing Yarn Factory and small and medium-sized cotton weaving industries. The Railway Machinery Factory ordered machine parts worth more than 30,000 jin of rice from the iron stove industry. The State Bank also issued a large number of loans, with over 100 billion yuan issued by the end of May alone. In addition, the People's Government also assisted private small handicraft workers in organizing joint operations and joint sales. These have played a significant role in the recovery of private enterprises. At the beginning of June, the city also adjusted the scope of operations and prices of public and private businesses, deciding to reduce the original 30 state-owned retail companies to 22, only operating major goods such as grain, salt, coal, and cloth; and determined that the difference between wholesale and retail prices should be 3% to 10%, so that private businesses could obtain a certain profit.
　　At present, the wheat harvest season has arrived, and some industrial and commercial enterprises have encountered a favorable season. Therefore, there were no closed businesses in June, and some of the past closed businesses have resumed operations or are preparing to resume operations.

　　石家庄主要私营企业
    暂时困难逐渐克服
    商品销售量显著增加
    【新华社二十三日讯】石家庄市主要私营工商业在人民政府和国营企业的扶助下，已逐步克服了产品滞销、资金缺乏等困难。目前该市主要商品的销售量已有显著增加。铁货产品，三月份只销十六万余斤，五月份增至四十九万斤，春季存货已大部卖出。白布月销量在五月中旬以前为一千七百五十匹，以后增至四千一百五十二匹。粮食由日销八万斤增至三十万斤左右，已恢复了正常销售量。面粉日销农村千余袋。榨油业今后八个月生产的豆饼，已为农民全部订购。窑业也因农民修理房屋需要砖瓦，产品供不应求。
    在该市私营工商业普遍遭到困难时，市人民政府与国营企业曾进行了一系列的扶助。首先，市人民政府召集了工商界举行各种会议，着重向他们指出困难是暂时的，而且是完全可以克服的，在新民主主义阶段，私营企业发展的前途是广阔的，因而初步扭转了私营工商业家对于人民政府政策的怀疑，提高了他们经营的信心。五月中旬前后，国营企业以三百九十亿元收购农产品，使农民购买力大大增加，为私营企业的产品销售创造了有利的条件。同时，国营企业又以委托加工、定货等方式扶助私营企业。花纱布公司对大兴纱厂和中小棉织业都继续予以委托加工的扶助。铁路机厂订购铁炉业的机件价值三万余斤米。国家银行并发放大量贷款，仅五月底即发放百余亿元。此外，人民政府并协助私营小手工业者，组织联营联销。这些对于私营企业的恢复都起了很大的作用。六月初，该市又调整了公私商业的经营范围和价格，决定将原有的三十个国营零售公司缩减为二十二个，只经营粮、盐、煤、布等主要货物；确定批发与零售价格有百分之三到百分之十的差额，使私营商业获得一定的利润。
    目前，麦秋已届，部分工商业已逢有利季节。因此六月份已无歇业户，若干过去的歇业户并已恢复营业或正在准备恢复中。
