　　North China Material Exchange Gradually Becomes Active
    Various Specialized Companies Purchase Large Quantities of Local Products to Supply Daily Necessities
    [This Newspaper's Report] Material exchange between small and medium cities and the broad countryside in the North China region is gradually becoming active. Various state-owned specialized companies are actively purchasing local products to promote the use of the local currency in rural areas, while also supplying daily necessities to farmers.
    In order to vigorously purchase and sell local products from various parts of the province and increase the purchasing power of farmers, the Hebei Provincial Native Produce Company convened a meeting of its branch companies stationed within the province in late May in Shijiazhuang. It was decided that in future business operations, the practice of only focusing on purchasing without considering sales should be corrected, and the phenomenon of capital accumulation and poor turnover should be overcome. Currently, various localities are actively purchasing. The Baoding Special District and the city's supply and marketing cooperative have signed business contracts with various specialized companies. They have now completed the collection of 7 million jin of cotton and the purchase of 1.35 million jin of cotton on behalf of the government. More than 7 million jin of peanuts have been collected, and the allocation of improved varieties has been carried out. In addition, more than 4,167,000 fresh eggs have been purchased on behalf of the government. At the same time, in conjunction with state-owned companies, the task of promoting industrial products and withdrawing currency from circulation has been completed. Since May, more than 1.35 million jin of edible salt have been sold on commission.
    In Zhangjiakou City, Chahar Province, the fur industry, after price stabilization, with the RMB penetrating deeply into the rural areas, the number of new wool shipments to the city for resale is increasing. The Zhangjiakou Fur Company has also been purchasing in large quantities since May. Purchases in April were only 120,000 jin, but in May, in just 25 days, 250,000 jin were purchased, accounting for 75% of the city's total purchases. From May 22nd onwards, the purchase volume increased daily. Purchases on the 22nd were only 10,900 jin, but by the 25th, they had increased to nearly 50,000 jin per day. All 32 private trading houses in the city are also experiencing a busy month with people coming and going. After purchasing, some of the houses transfer the goods to the Fur Company, while others directly transport them to Tianjin for export. Due to the active trade between urban and rural areas, the turnover of several private businesses in the city has also increased significantly. For example, the turnover of Yongfa, a grocery store, in the first nine days of June reached more than 43.6 million yuan, equivalent to 151% of the total turnover in May. Furthermore, Hengfa Long, a department store in Xuanhua City, has seen a rapid improvement in its business situation and an increase in turnover from more than 6 million yuan in January to 10.83 million yuan in May, because the goods it sells are mostly daily necessities needed by farmers, and the store has established credit wholesale relationships with more than 30 small vendors, selling as far as Huashao Ying and Shenjing areas. The goods supplied to small vendors account for 80% of the total turnover.
    The Gui Sui Fur Purchasing Team of the former Baotou Fur Branch Company in Suiyuan Province, after signing a short-term wool purchase contract with the province's Supply and Marketing Cooperative at the beginning of May, and coinciding with the peak wool production season, has also seen a large increase in purchase volume. Purchases have increased from 2,000 to 3,000 jin per day to a maximum of more than 30,000 jin per day. Currently, there are more than 20 staff members who are continuing to strengthen over-the-counter purchases. In addition, the original Gui Sui Native Produce Company (formerly affiliated to the Baotou Native Produce Company), after being reorganized into a provincial company on May 20th, immediately determined that its central task was to face the countryside and purchase farmers' by-products. It has now established three purchasing teams in Chasuchi, Qixiaying, and Gong Lama, and began purchasing in Gong Lama in early May, mainly mobilizing local farmers to dig up medicinal materials. Initially, only 2,000 to 3,000 jin could be purchased per day, but this gradually increased to more than 10,000 jin. In order to supply farmers with clothing, tools, daily necessities, etc., the company not only pays cash for purchases but also provides some goods in kind. In twenty days, more than a thousand bolts of homespun cloth, 600 jin of naked oat flour, 30 iron shovels, 20 reed mats, and more than 25.4 million yuan in cash have been exchanged. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, since establishing a supply and marketing cooperative in Tuoketuo County in March, has supplied a large number of daily necessities, and in the past two months, it has changed the situation in the past where silver dollars and opium were used as trading media in the market and were unwilling to accept RMB, thus establishing solid credit for RMB. In the most recent two months, according to incomplete statistics, more than 40,000 jin of licorice root, more than 112,000 jin of grain, and more than 400 jin of sheep wool have been purchased; and many 2,000 bolts of homespun cloth and other daily necessities have been sold.
    In order to complete the withdrawal of currency from circulation and supply daily necessities to the vast number of farmers, the Anyang City Department Store in Pingyuan Province has also recently organized four sales teams to go to Lin County, Jun County, Tangyin and Shuiye to sell department store goods. Each sales team has put forward the slogan of not only going deep into the countryside, but also delivering department store goods to the doorsteps of the farmers. The Xinxiang Oil Company, as the new rapeseed is about to enter the market, in order to stabilize the price of rapeseed, has also signed a contract with the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, entrusting it to purchase 8 million jin of rapeseed.
    In addition, the Taiyuan Branch of the China Oil Company, in order to correctly implement the purchase and sales policy and closely integrate with local cooperatives, has purchased more than 53,960 dan of various oilseeds from January to May, exceeding the original plan. At the same time, it has sold more than 197,910 gallons of kerosene, also exceeding the original plan.
    Currently, purchasing work is still continuing in various places, and many regions are preparing to purchase large quantities of wheat from farmers when the new wheat is on the market, supplying daily necessities, and striving to achieve equivalent exchange in price, so as to effectively protect the interests of farmers.

　　华北物资交流渐活跃
    各专业公司大量收购土产供应日用品
    【本报讯】华北地区各中小城市与广大农村间，物资交流渐趋活跃，各国营专业公司积极进行土产收购，推行本币下乡，同时供应农民日用必需品。
    河北省土产公司为大力收购和推销省内各地土产，提高农民购买力，曾于五月下旬在石市召开驻省内各支公司会议，确定今后在业务经营上，要纠正过去只作收购不顾销路的做法，克服积压资金周转不灵的现象。现各地正在积极收购。保定专区及市供销社与各专业公司订立业务合同，现已完成代征棉七百万斤，代购棉一百三十五万斤。征花生米七百多万斤，并进行了优良品种的调剂，另外还代购鲜蛋四百一十六万七千余个。同时，结合国营公司完成了工业品的推销和货币回笼任务，五月份以来，仅食盐即代销了一百三十五万余斤。
    察省张家口市皮毛业，在物价稳定后，人民币深入农村，新毛输往市内转销者日益增多。张市皮毛公司从五月份起，亦大量收购，四月份收购仅十二万斤，到五月份只二十五天即收购二十五万斤，占全市收购量百分之七十五。从五月二十二日以后，收购量更逐日增加，二十二日收购仅一万零九百余斤，到二十五日即增到每日收购近五万斤。全市三十二家私营贩卖栈，亦正处于人出人进的旺月。各栈收购后，有的转给皮毛公司，有的直接运往天津输出。由于城乡交易的活跃，该市若干私营商号营业额亦显著增加。如杂货业永发和六月上旬九天内的营业额即达四千三百六十余万元，相当于五月份全月营业额的百分之一五一。又宣化市百货业恒发隆，由于经营的物品多半是农民必需的日用品，且该号与三十余个小商贩建立了信用批发关系，远至花梢营、深井一带推销。供给小贩的货品占总营业额的百分之八十，致营业情况迅速好转，营业额从一月份的六百多万元增至五月份的一千零八十三万元。
    绥远省原包头皮毛分公司驻归绥皮毛收购小组，自五月初与该省供销总社订立短期购毛合同后，又正值产毛旺季，收购额亦大增。从每日收购二、三千斤增至每日最多可收三万余斤。现有工作人员二十余人仍在进一步加强门市收购。又原归绥土产公司（原属包头土产公司）自五月二十日改组为省公司后，即确定中心工作为面向农村，收购农民副产品，现已在察素齐、旗下营、公喇嘛等三地设立了三个收购小组，五月初在公喇嘛开始收购，主要发动当地农民刨采药材。最初每日只能收购二、三千斤，后逐日增加到了万余斤。公司为供应农民穿衣、使用工具、日用品等需要，故除付现款收购外，也供给一部分实物。二十天工夫已经换出土布千余匹，莜面六百斤，铁锹三十把，芦席二十领及现款二千五百四十多万元。该省供销总社自三月间在托县建立供销社外，大量供应日用必需品，两个月来，已改变了过去市场上以银元和烟土作交易媒介、不愿接受人民币的局面，而使人民币建立了巩固的信用。到最近两个月中，据不完全统计，共收购甘草四万余斤，粮食十一万二千余斤，羊毛四百余斤；出售土布两千匹及其他日用物品甚多。
    平原省安阳市百货公司为完成货币回笼与供应广大农民日用必需品，亦于最近组织了四个推销组分赴林县，浚县、汤阴及水冶四处推销百货，各推销组均提出不但要深入农村，而且要把百货送到农民群众家门口的口号。新乡油脂公司，因目前正值新菜籽即将上市，为平稳菜籽价格，亦与省供销社签订合同，委托收购菜籽八百万斤。
    另外，中国油脂公司太原分公司，为正确执行收购与推销政策。密切结合各地合作社，一至五月份，已收购各种油料五万三千九百六十余担，超过了原订计划。同时，推销了煤油十九万七千九百一十多加仑，亦超过了原订计划。
    现各地收购工作仍在继续进行，不少地区并已准备在新麦上市时，大量收购农民小麦，供应日用必需品，并在价格上力求做到等价交换，切实保障农民利益。
