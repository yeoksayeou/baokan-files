　　A Production Model Company
    A unit of the People's Liberation Army now stationed in southern Xinjiang, which has a glorious tradition in the Nanniwan Great Production Movement in northern Shaanxi, has achieved brilliant results since launching the Great Production Movement this spring. In just over a month, from March 10th to April 14th, the unit reclaimed more than 51,000 mu of wasteland and sowed more than 38,000 mu of spring wheat, cotton, flax, and rapeseed.

    The unit has been able to achieve such great production results because it has adopted a series of measures to mobilize the production enthusiasm and creativity of the soldiers. The Third Machine Gun Company of a certain regiment of the unit is a good example of leading troops in production. The company has won the title of "Production Model Company." The Third Machine Gun Company has a total of 102 people, and more than 80 people are engaged in agricultural production. In one month, they reclaimed 1,200 mu of wasteland, completing the production plan of 12 mu of reclamation per person for the entire company. The company's main experience is to give full play to the core role of the Communist Party branch, the backbone role of heroes and models, and to carry out democratic movements in production.

    Before the start of the production movement, the Communist Party branch of the company led the entire company in carrying out ideological mobilization work of "calculating the victory account" and "pouring out grievances," overcoming the incorrect understanding of the production movement by a few people.

    After the start of production, the branch promptly understood the ideological situation, and all the problems arising in production were discussed in depth within the Party, and solutions were devised. During the production process, due to the high production enthusiasm of everyone, especially the high enthusiasm of heroes and models, the company had experienced a phenomenon of excessive shock work. In response to this situation, the Communist Party branch of the company promptly made a decision to make long-term plans and cherish labor; and proposed that "reducing attrition" is one of the conditions for evaluating the merits of each squad.

    At the same time, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party branch of the company, heroes and models played a backbone role in the entire company. They led the masses forward with active labor. For example, Special Class Model He Zedi, Class A Model and squad leader of the Fifth Squad, Yang Yaohua, led everyone in intensive cultivation in the wasteland overgrown with thorns. In order to eradicate the grass, they sometimes dug more than a foot deep. They put forward the slogan "Dig up one more grass, harvest one more grain." Special Class Hero Model, platoon leader of the Third Platoon, Shi Peiyu, in addition to leading everyone to work actively, also paid special attention to the health of the soldiers. He often got up at night to cover the soldiers with quilts; he effectively grasped the time during production and cherished labor, so the entire platoon had a high production enthusiasm.

    Under the correct grasp of the Communist Party branch and leading cadres of the company, the company adopted the form of "small-scale appraisals" and "production research groups" to carry out democratic movements in the great production. They consolidated and improved everyone's production enthusiasm through mass commendation and criticism, and concentrated everyone's experience and wisdom. The conditions for "appraisal" included production performance (including intensive cultivation), labor attitude, labor discipline, unity and mutual assistance, etc. In order to take care of the differences in physical strength, they were divided into three groups, A, B, and C, according to physical condition. When evaluating merits, they were divided into upper, middle, and lower class merits within the same group. The soldiers were very satisfied with this kind of appraisal, and those with poor physical strength also eliminated their negative emotions. After the merits were evaluated, on the way back, the soldiers collectively created small poems with the materials of the merit evaluation, one sentence at a time. For example: "Li Chonghui, short in stature; Good at doing things, strong in strength; High enthusiasm for production; One breath, not tired; Makes contributions on the production front." The propagandist recorded it and wrote it on the blackboard newspaper for everyone to see.

    Each platoon established a "production research group" responsible for improving production technology and labor organization. They studied how to prevent blisters on hands, how to dig dry land, wetlands, and grasslands, how to avoid damaging the adze, and how to prevent the flax seeds from being blown away by the wind. They told the soldiers about the methods they had researched, and the soldiers were also happy to tell the research group about their own experiences and situations. This kind of democratic movement of "everyone contributing ideas and everyone thinking of ways" played a great role in promoting the production of the company. (Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 29th)

### 一个生产模范连

　　一个生产模范连
    过去在陕北南泥湾大生产运动中有着光荣传统的现驻新疆南部的人民解放军某部，自今春开展大生产运动后，已有了辉煌的成绩。在三月十日到四月十四日一个多月的时间中，该部垦荒达五万一千多亩；播种春麦、棉花、胡麻、油菜等三万八千多亩。
    该部所以能够做出这样大的生产成绩，是由于它采取了一系列的办法，发动了战士们的生产热情和创造性。该部某团机枪第三连就是一个领导部队生产的好典型。该连已取得“生产模范连”的称号。机枪第三连共一百零二人，参加农业生产的有八十余人，在一个月中开荒一千二百亩，完成了全连每人开荒十二亩的生产计划。该连的主要经验是充分发挥共产党支部的核心作用、英雄模范的骨干作用和展开生产中的民主运动。
    该连共产党支部于生产运动开始以前，领导全连展开了“算胜利账”、“诉苦”的思想动员工作，克服了少数人对生产运动的不正确认识。
    生产开始后，支部及时了解思想情况，对于生产中所产生的一些问题都在党内进行深入的讨论，并想出解决的办法。在生产过程中，由于大家的生产情绪的高涨，尤其是英雄模范们的高度的积极性，该连曾发生过分突击的现象。针对这种情况，该连共产党支部及时地作出了要作长期打算，爱护劳动力的决定；并提出“少减员”是各班评功条件之一。
    同时，在连的共产党支部的正确领导下，英雄模范们在全连中发挥了骨干作用。他们以积极的劳动带领群众一同前进。如特等模范何泽弟，甲等模范、五班班长杨耀华，带领大家在荆棘丛生的荒地中精耕细作，为了要斩草除根，有时挖到一尺多深。他们提出了“多挖一颗草，多打一颗粮”的口号。特等英雄模范、三排排长史培玉，除了带着大家积极劳动外，还特别注意战士们的健康。他在晚上经常起来为战士们盖被子；生产时切实掌握时间，爱护劳动力，所以全排生产情绪很高。
    在连的共产党支部和领导干部正确掌握下，该连采取了“小型评比”和“生产研究小组”的形式，来开展大生产中的民主运动。他们通过群众性的表扬、批评，集中大家的经验和智慧，来巩固和提高大家的生产积极性。“评比”的条件是生产成绩（包括精耕细作）、劳动态度、劳动纪律、团结互助等项。为了照顾体力上的差别，又按体力情况分为甲、乙、丙三组。评比功绩时，在同一组内又分为上、中、下三等功。对这种评比战士们很满意，体力较差的人也因而打消消极情绪。评完功后，战士们在回去的路上，就以评功的材料，你一句我一句地集体创作出小诗来。例如：“李崇会，个子小；干事情，力量好；对生产，情绪高；一股劲，不疲劳；生产战线立功劳。”宣传员就把它记了下来，写在黑板报上给大家看。
    各排都成立了“生产研究小组”，负责改进生产技术和劳动力的组织。他们研究出怎样防止手打泡，怎样挖干地、湿地、草地，怎样可以少弄坏镢头，怎样使播的胡麻种不被风吹掉。他们把研究出来的办法告诉战士们，战士也乐意把他们自己的经验和情况告诉研究小组。这种“人人出主意，个个想办法”的民主运动，对该连的生产起了很大的推动作用。（新华社迪化二十九日电）
