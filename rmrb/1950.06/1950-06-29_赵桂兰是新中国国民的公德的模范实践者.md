　　Zhao Guilan is a Model Practitioner of Public Morality of the New China's Citizens
    Zuo Zhenguo
    Comrade Zhao Guilan did this to protect the property of the country and the people, thus modeling the public morality of "love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, and protect public property" of the new China's citizens. As a party member, he resolutely implemented the party's organizational principle—the individual interests of party members unconditionally subordinate to the overall interests of the party. Such a group of excellent and outstanding party members who can sacrifice themselves has become a major condition for the victory of the revolution. They are the glory of the party, and definitely not the party's "burden" as some comrades say!

　　赵桂兰是新中国国民的公德的模范实践者
    左振国
    赵桂兰同志这样做，保护了国家人民的财产，这就模范地实践了新中国国民“爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物”的公德。以一个党员来说，他坚决地执行了党的组织原则——党员个人利益无条件服从党的整体利益。这样一批能牺牲自己的优秀卓越的党员已经成为革命取得胜利的一个主要条件。他们是党的荣誉，决不如某些同志所说的是党的“负担”！
