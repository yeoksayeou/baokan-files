　　Shaanxi Huaxian Communist Youth League Members Actively Participate in Wheat Harvesting

　　The Huaxian People's Government in Shaanxi Province, during this year's summer harvest, assigned cadres at all levels to go to the countryside to help families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, as well as farmers lacking labor, with the wheat harvest. The County Communist Youth League Committee sent Comrades Zhao Lingqi and Wang Yanlin to the Sixth Township of the First District. They were very responsible in their work and, within a week, carried out the following tasks:

　　(1) They assisted nine Party and League members in the township, including Li Zicai and Gu Yubang, in organizing nine mutual aid teams to harvest 63.5 mu of wheat for 30 households of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, as well as farmers lacking labor. Currently, all 6,261 mu of wheat fields in the township have been completely harvested, and some have already been threshed. Party and League members played an active leading role in the mutual aid. For example, when harvesting wheat for the family of revolutionary martyr Wang Qinzhi, Gu Yubang led two mutual aid teams to harvest two mu of wheat overnight. Female League members Li Yinqiao and Li Fenwa, among others, not only finished their own field work early but also helped a military family surnamed Li thresh and winnowed 2.4 shi of wheat. In addition, during the summer harvest, the children of Yapo Fort Village, under the leadership of Comrades Zhao Lingqi and Wang Yanlin, voluntarily organized themselves into two wheat cutting teams and one wheat gleaning patrol team, totaling 18 people, which was very lively. On the first day of wheat cutting, they harvested 5.5 mu of wheat in the rain and carried it to the threshing ground themselves. The wheat gleaning patrol team discovered three wheat thieves, who were caught and educated before being released after they reported them to the working comrades.

　　(2) In order to ensure increased wheat production next year, the government called on the masses to pay attention to seed selection. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry also compiled and printed a booklet entitled "How to Select Wheat Seeds." Based on this booklet, they widely publicized the importance of seed selection and the methods of seed selection to the farmers. According to statistics, a total of 252.8 shi of various high-quality wheat seeds were collectively selected from 81 mu of wheat fields, which provided a good guarantee for the township's wheat seed needs for increased production next year.

　　陕西华县青年团员  积极参加麦收工作
    陕西省华县人民政府，在今年夏收工作中，曾分派各级干部下乡，帮助军工烈属及缺乏劳力的农民进行麦收。县青年团工委派赵玲琪、汪炎林二同志前赴一区六乡。他们在工作中，很负责任，在一周的时间内，进行了以下的工作：
    （一）协助该乡党、团员李子才、古毓邦等九人，组织了九个变工组，给烈军工属及无劳力的农民三十户共收了六十三亩五分地的麦子。目前该乡所有麦田六千二百六十一亩，都通通割完，并有一部分已经碾过了。在变工中，党、团员起了积极带头的作用。如给工属王钦志收麦时，古毓邦领了两个变工组一夜割了二亩麦子。女团员李银巧、李芬娃等三人，不但把自己场里活早早做完，而且还打伙帮助一位姓李的军属碾场，并且帮助扬出了二石四斗麦子。此外，在夏收中，崖坡堡村的少年儿童在赵玲琪及汪炎林二同志的领导下，自愿的组织起来，编成了两个割麦组、一个拾麦巡查组，共计十八人，搞得非常热闹。在割麦的第一天，他们冒雨割了五亩五分地的麦子，并由他们自己抬到场里。拾麦巡查组，曾发现了三个偷麦的，经他们报告工作同志，捉住后予以教育才释放了。
    （二）为了保证来年增产麦子，政府号召群众重视选种工作。陕省人民政府农林厅，并编印“怎样选小麦种籽”小册子一本。他们根据这个小册子，将选种的重要性，和选种的办法向农民作了广泛宣传。据统计，全乡从八十一亩麦田中，以集体进行的方式，共选出各种优良麦种二百五十二石八斗，使该乡来年增产所需的麦种获得了很好的保证。
