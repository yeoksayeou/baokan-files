　　【Wuhu News】According to the Southern Anhui Daily: State-owned native produce companies in various parts of Southern Anhui are vigorously supporting rural sideline production and actively purchasing local and special products. The Southern Anhui Branch of the State-owned China Native Produce Company established branch companies in Chizhou, Xuancheng, and Tunxi, as well as offices in Jingxian, Ningguo, and Qingyang, in mid-April. These companies immediately began purchasing local and special products in their respective areas. According to incomplete statistics, in less than a month, from late April to May 15th, the total value of local and special products purchased by these companies reached approximately 5 billion yuan. The main products purchased included over 300,000 jin of tea, over 110,000 jin of tung oil, over 500,000 jin of charcoal, over 130,000 jin of alum, over 12,000 jin of green hemp, and over 3,000 jin of native medicine. Other products included native coal, hide oil, green oil, raw silk, watch paper, and pine boards. With the rapeseed harvest beginning, the large-scale purchase of rapeseed is also gradually underway. The native produce company's purchase of local and special products during this period has played a significant role in helping the vast number of farmers overcome livelihood difficulties during the spring famine. For example, in most areas of the Chizhou and Xuancheng regions, farmers rely on sideline production to solve their food problems during the lean period between harvests. This year, through the purchases made by the native produce company, and with the cooperation of state-owned specialized companies dealing in grain and general merchandise, a large supply of various daily necessities was provided at reasonable prices, ensuring the farmers' food and daily needs.
