　　One of the Markers of the Fundamental Change in China's Political and Economic Nature
    Customs Regulations to be Drafted
    National Customs Conference to be Held Soon
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] The General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government recently issued a notice deciding to convene a national customs conference starting June 19 to discuss the draft customs regulations. This draft regulation was drafted by the General Administration of Customs after four months of meticulous research and extensive discussion in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council. Responsible cadres from customs offices across the country will be sent to participate in this conference.
    Note: In its nearly century-long history, the old Chinese customs has always operated according to the orders and directives of imperialism and its agents – foreign Inspector Generals of Customs – and individual separate regulations of government agencies. There has never been, nor could there ever be, a true basic customs law. However, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the new customs has completely broken free from the control of imperialism and is now completely independent and autonomous. It is necessary and possible to formulate customs regulations. This is one of the markers of the fundamental change in China's political and economic nature.

　　我国政治经济性质根本转变的标帜之一
    海关法规将着手制订
    全国关务会议不久即将召开
    【新华社四日讯】中央人民政府海关总署日前发出通知，决定于六月十九日起召开全国关务会议，讨论海关法规草案。该法规草案，系海关总署遵照政务院的指示，经过四个月的缜密研究与广泛讨论后所草拟者。全国各海关均将派负责干部参加这一会议。
    按：旧中国海关在其存在将近百年的历史中，一向是按着帝国主义及其代理人——外籍总税务司的通令、指令和政府机关个别的单行规章办事，从来没有也不可能有真正的海关基本法，而中华人民共和国成立后，新海关已完全摆脱帝国主义的控制，已完全独立自主，必须而且也可能制定海关法规。这是我国政治和经济性质的根本转变的标帜之一。
