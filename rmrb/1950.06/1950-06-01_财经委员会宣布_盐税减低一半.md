　　Xinhua News Agency, May 31st: The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, in order to alleviate the people's burden and effectively eliminate private salt production, has decided to reduce the current salt tax rate by half, effective June 1st. Based on the different salt production and marketing costs in various regions, the national salt tax rates will be re-determined as follows: North China and East China, 70,000 yuan per dan; Shanxi and Southwest, 50,000 yuan; Guangdong and Guangxi, 60,000 yuan; Northwest, 30,000 yuan (Northeast and Inner Mongolia to be determined separately); sea salt will be taxed at 30% of the salt tax rate (Guangdong reduced to 10%); earth salt and gypsum salt will be taxed at 60% of the salt tax rate.

　　Regarding the losses suffered by salt merchants due to the tax reduction on existing salt stocks, although this is a special phenomenon in some regions and the quantity of salt stocks held by salt merchants is not large, the Financial and Economic Committee, to take care of the difficulties of salt merchants, has also stipulated the following compensation measures: (1) These measures only apply to the North China, East China, and Central South regions. (2) Salt merchants eligible for compensation are limited to those who have registered with the China Salt Industry Corporation before June 1st and continue to operate transportation and sales businesses. (3) Existing salt stocks purchased with high taxes or on which excessive profit tax has been paid will be compensated according to the following provisions: A. For existing salt on which excessive profit tax has been paid, those who paid 30 jin of staple grain per dan will be compensated 10 jin, those who paid 35 jin will be compensated 15 jin, those who paid 40 jin will be compensated 20 jin, and those who paid 45 jin will be compensated 25 jin. B. Existing salt purchased with high taxes will be compensated 50 jin of staple grain per dan. (4) The collection of excessive profit tax on existing salt that has been registered in the past but has not yet paid excessive profit tax should be stopped immediately. (5) Local salt bureaus should, together with the tax bureaus and the salt industry corporation, register the quantity of salt stocks held by salt merchants within a specified time limit based on the situation, and report the amount of staple grain to be compensated (the price of staple grain should be calculated based on the local wholesale price) to the Salt Affairs General Bureau for verification and compensation. (6) The amount of grain compensated to salt merchants will not be paid in cash, but the salt bureau can issue a voucher to be deducted from the tax payment when purchasing and transporting salt in the future. (7) These measures and the regulations for reducing tax rates will be published and implemented on June 1st.

　　财经委员会宣布
    盐税减低一半
    【新华社三十一日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会为减轻人民负担，并以有效办法取缔私盐，决定自六月一日起将现行食盐税额减半征收，并根据各地产盐与运销成本的不同情况，将今后全国各区食盐税额，重新核定为：华北、华东每担七万元，山西、西南五万元，两广六万元，西北三万元（东北、内蒙另定）；渔盐按食盐税额百分之三十计征（广东减按百分之十计征）；土盐、膏盐按食盐税额百分之六十计征。
    对于盐商存盐因减税所受亏损，虽属部分地区的特殊现象，且盐商存盐数量不大，但财经委员会为照顾盐商困难起见，亦规定补偿办法如下：（一）本办法只适用于华北、华东、中南三区。（二）受补偿之盐商以自六月一日前已向中国盐业公司申请登记，继续经营运销业务者为限。（三）盐商重税购进或已缴纳过份利得税之现存盐斤，依下列规定补偿之：甲、已缴纳过份利得税之存盐，每担缴纳主粮三十斤者，补偿十斤，缴纳三十五斤者，补偿十五斤，缴纳四十斤者，补偿二十斤，缴纳四十五斤者，补偿二十五斤。乙、重税购进之存盐，每担补偿主粮五十斤。（四）过去已进行登记而尚未缴纳过份利得税之存盐，应即停止征收。（五）各地盐局应会同税局、盐业公司，依据情况，限期将盐商存盐数量登记，并将应补偿之主粮数（主粮价格以各地批发价为计算标准）报经盐务总局核实补偿。（六）补偿盐商之粮数，不发现款，可由盐局发给凭证于日后购运盐斤时，在税款中扣除。（七）本办法与减低税额之规定，同于六月一日登报公布施行。
