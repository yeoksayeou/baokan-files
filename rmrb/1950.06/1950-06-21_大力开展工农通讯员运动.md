　　Vigorously Develop the Worker-Peasant Correspondent Movement
    To attract a broad base of worker and peasant readers to participate in newspaper work, to make newspapers the newspapers of the worker and peasant masses themselves, and to fill newspapers with the voices of the worker and peasant masses—this is the fundamental difference between the people's newspapers and all other newspapers. In the Soviet Union, as early as 1926, Pravda already had more than 200,000 correspondents; today, with the great achievements of socialist construction, the number of worker-peasant correspondents must have grown even more significantly.
    In addition to reporting news, worker-peasant correspondents are also an important political force in the country, a vital force for uniting and elevating activists among the people, mobilizing the masses to participate in construction and self-criticism. Comrade Stalin, in his article "Concerning the Question of Self-Criticism," said: "It is also undeniable that, as a result of self-criticism, our newspapers have become more active and lively, and our ranks of newspaper workers, such as the worker correspondent organizations, have begun to turn into a major political force." Clearly, if we do not pay attention to the organization of worker-peasant correspondents, we will not have this major political force.
    How have our newspapers performed in this regard? Individual newspapers in the old liberated areas have a relatively solid foundation in communication work and a relatively large number of worker-peasant correspondents. For example, the Hebei Daily had 16,000 correspondents in March of this year; the Northern Jiangsu Daily had 12,000 correspondents in May of this year, including 550 rural communication groups and 2,922 farmer correspondents (including rural cadres and rural primary school teachers) in Shuyang County alone. With such a relatively extensive network of worker-peasant correspondents, newspapers can better reflect the state of people's labor and production. As the Northern Jiangsu Daily stated: "A large number of contributions are supplied to us by a wide range of correspondents from factories, rural areas, and government offices, reflecting everything from the arrangements of leading organs to the specific implementation in townships and villages." Without such a network of worker-peasant correspondents, the reflection in the newspapers would be like that of the Jiangxi Daily, which, in its anniversary review, admitted: "There are only activities of leading organs, but no practical actions of the masses."
    However, most of our newspapers, including those in both the old and new areas, have not actively developed worker-peasant correspondents. The Pingyuan Daily had more than 5,000 correspondents in May of this year, but only 440 of them were worker-peasant correspondents, and only 54 farmer correspondents maintained close contact with the newspaper.
    The fact that the people's newspapers have not mobilized the vast worker-peasant masses to participate in the work, and that the number of worker-peasant correspondents is so small, should be seen as a very important problem.
    What are the reasons for this phenomenon? We believe that the most fundamental reason is that our newspaper workers still have a weak mass viewpoint, and have long held the idea that newspapers are for cadres to read, without clearly recognizing that newspapers are generally first and foremost for the people, for speaking to the masses. Therefore, in communication work, the organization of correspondents is also limited to cadres. The Jiangxi Daily, in its review of its communication work, said: "Correspondents are mostly limited to the circle of cadres, not deeply involved in all levels of society and different work departments... Simply relying on the promotion and organization of leading organs, neglecting and loosening the combination of top-down promotion with bottom-up mobilization."
    Relying on leading organs and organizing correspondents among cadres was once the main method of developing correspondents in rural areas and in wartime, and it was necessary at the time. But today, this can no longer be regarded as the main method. However, either due to the force of habit, or due to reliance on this seemingly easy top-down approach, most newspapers still adopt this method. Comrades of the Changjiang Daily had taken such a "winding road" in communication work: They once developed correspondents through open solicitation, and as a result, a large number of articles from activists at all levels flooded into the newspaper office, but because they found that these articles were difficult to adopt and these correspondents were difficult to cultivate, they even "abandoned contact with these already mobilized large numbers of correspondents." They returned to seek help from the leading organs and developed correspondents among cadres from the top down, thus embarking on the old road of "trapping correspondents only in the circle of cadres, and not paying attention to developing correspondents among the activists in the worker and peasant masses." As the Changjiang Daily said, this "winding road" is the result of a "harmful ideology."
    Another reason why our newspaper workers have neglected the development of worker-peasant correspondents is that they lack sufficient understanding of the truth that news should reflect the lively and vivid facts among the people. Because they one-sidedly pursue "guidance" in news reporting, believing that only comprehensive, integrated, and summary articles written by cadre correspondents can have "guiding significance," they regard the vivid facts written by worker-peasant correspondents as unable to have "guiding significance." Kalinin said: "Soviet journalists should seek the connection between every local phenomenon and the overall phenomenon, the unified connection between the local and the whole, which is precisely in line with the true development of people's social life." Lacking this understanding, our newspaper workers have not given enough attention to the worker-peasant correspondents who mainly provide us with vivid "local phenomena."
    These are the reasons that hinder us from vigorously developing the worker-peasant correspondent movement and mobilizing the broad worker-peasant masses to participate in newspaper work. It is precisely because of this that our newspapers appear rigid, dull, and lacking specific and vivid social narratives in front of the people.
    The lack of extensive worker-peasant correspondents participating in newspaper work is one of the main shortcomings in the current newspaper work. Naturally, the help of leading organs for communication work and the network of correspondents among cadres are still necessary. The General Administration of News's "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work" has clearly pointed out: "The newspaper's correspondent network should be based on activists among the people, in addition to activists among workers and peasants, it should also absorb active staff members from government agencies and progressive intellectuals." However, since our current shortcoming is primarily the lack of extensive worker-peasant correspondents participating in newspaper work, vigorously developing the worker-peasant correspondent movement should be the main direction of efforts to improve work. In order to implement this effort, overcome ideological and methodological obstacles, value the vivid and specific reflections of actual life from the worker-peasant masses, improve our reporting work, and change the way of relying solely on leading organs to develop correspondents among cadres from the top down, are all extremely necessary.
    Let us open the doors of our newspapers, and let thousands upon thousands of worker-peasant correspondents actively participate in our newspaper work!

### 大力开展工农通讯员运动

　　大力开展工农通讯员运动
    吸引广大的工农读者参加报纸工作，使报纸成为工农大众自己的报纸，使报纸上充满工农大众的声音，这是人民的报纸与其他一切报纸的根本区别。在苏联，还在一九二六年，真理报便已经有了二十万以上的通讯员；到了现在，随着社会主义建设的伟大成就，工农通讯员的数量一定有更大的发展。
    工农通讯员除了报道新闻之外，还是国家的一个重要的政治力量，是团结和提高人民群众中的积极分子，动员群众参加建设事业和自我批评的一个重要力量。斯大林同志在《反对把自我批评口号庸俗化》一文中说：“也不可否认，由于自我批评的结果，我们的报刊成为了更加活跃和生动的报刊，而我们的报纸工作人员队伍，类如工人通讯组织，已经开始变成重大的政治力量了。”显然，如果我们不注意工农通讯员的组织，我们就不会有这种重大的政治力量。
    我们的报纸在这一方面表现得怎样呢？个别老解放区的报纸，通讯工作比较有基础，工农通讯员的数量比较多。例如，河北日报在今年三月间有一万六千个通讯员；苏北日报在今年五月有一万二千个通讯员，其中沭阳一县便有五百五十个乡村通讯小组，二千九百二十二个农民通讯员（其中包括乡村干部和乡村小学教师）。有了这样比较广大的工农通讯员网，报纸便能更好地反映人民劳动生产的状况了。苏北日报说：“广大的通讯员从工厂里、农村中、机关里供给我们大批稿件，从领导机关的布置，到一个乡、村的具体贯彻，都有了反映。”如果没有这样的工农通讯员网，那么报纸上的反映就会如江西日报在其出版一周年时所检讨的那样：“只有领导机关的活动，而没有群众的实际行动。”
    然而我们的大多数报纸，包括老区和新区的报纸，却正是没有积极发展工农通讯员。平原日报在今年五月有五千多通讯员，但工农通讯员却只有四百四十人，经常与报社保持密切联系的农民通讯员只有五十四人。
    人民的报纸而没有动员广大的工农群众来参加工作，工农通讯员的数量这样少，应该看成一个很重要的问题。
    产生这种现象的原因是什么呢？我们以为，最根本的原因是我们的报纸工作者的群众观点还很薄弱，长期地存在着一种思想，以为报纸是给干部看的；而没有明确地认识，报纸一般地是首先给人民大众看的，是向群众说话的。因此，表现在通讯工作上，通讯员的组织也就只是在干部中打圈子。江西日报检讨他们的通讯工作说：“通讯员多限制在干部的圈子里，没有深入到社会各个阶层、各个不同的工作部门中去，……单纯依靠领导机关推动组织，忽视和放松了自上而下的推动结合自下而上的发动。”
    依靠领导机关，在干部中组织通讯员，在农村和战争环境中曾经是发展通讯员的主要办法，在当时是必要的。但到了今天，这已经不能再作为主要办法了。然而或者由于习惯的力量，或者由于对这种似乎是轻而易举的自上而下的方法的依赖，至今大部分报纸仍然采取着这种办法。长江日报的同志们在通讯工作上就曾经走过这样的“弯曲的道路”：他们曾用公开征求的方式发展通讯员，结果各阶层的积极分子的稿件大量地涌到报馆里来了，但他们因为发现这些稿件很难采用，这些通讯员很难培养，竟至把这些“已经发动起来的大批通讯员放弃了联系”。他们重新走回来向领导机关请求帮助，由上而下地在干部中发展通讯员，因而也走上了“把通讯员只陷在干部的圈子里，而不注意在工农群众中的积极分子里面去发展通讯员”的老路。诚如长江日报所说，这种“弯曲的道路”是一种“有害的思想”的结果。
    使我们的报纸工作者忽略了发展工农通讯员的另一个原因，是他们对新闻应该反映人民群众中生动活泼的事实这一真理，还缺少足够的认识。由于他们在新闻报道中片面地追求“指导性”，以为只有干部通讯员写出来的全面的、综合的、总结性的稿件，才能有“指导意义”，就把工农通讯员所写来的生动事实看作是不能有“指导意义”的。加里宁说：“苏维埃新闻记者应该寻找每一个局部现象和总的现象的联系，局部和整体统一的联系，这正是符合人们社会生活的真正发展的。”缺少这种认识，我们的报纸工作者对于那些主要是向我们提供生动的“局部现象”的工农通讯员，就没有给予足够的重视了。
    阻碍我们大力开展工农通讯员运动，动员广大的工农群众来参加报纸工作的原因就在这里。也正因此，使我们的报纸在人民群众面前，显得生硬、乏味，缺少具体生动的社会记事。
    缺少广大的工农通讯员参加报纸工作是目前报纸工作中的主要缺点之一。自然，领导机关对通讯工作的帮助、干部中的通讯员网还是必要的。新闻总署“关于改进报纸工作的决定”中已经明白指出：“报纸的通讯员网应当以人民群众中的积极分子为主体，除工人农民中的积极分子外，也要吸收政府机关中的积极的工作人员和进步的知识分子参加。”但是我们今天的缺点既然首先是缺少广大的工农通讯员参加报纸工作，大力开展工农通讯员运动就应该是改进工作的主要努力方向。为了贯彻这种努力，克服思想上和工作方法上的障碍，重视从工农大众中来的实际生活的生动具体的反映，改进我们的报道工作，并改变单纯依靠领导机关自上而下地在干部中发展通讯员的方式，都是极为必要的。
    让我们把报纸的大门打开来吧，让成千成万的工农通讯员来积极参加我们的报纸工作吧！
