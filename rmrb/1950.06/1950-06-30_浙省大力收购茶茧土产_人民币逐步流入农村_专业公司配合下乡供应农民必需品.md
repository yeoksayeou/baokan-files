　　Zhejiang Province Vigorously Purchases Tea Cocoons and Native Products
    RMB Gradually Flows into Rural Areas
    Professional Companies Cooperatively Supply Farmers' Necessities to the Countryside
    [Hangzhou News] Zhejiang Daily News: In various parts of Zhejiang, thanks to the government's vigorous purchase of tea, cocoons and other native and special products, RMB has been gradually flowing into rural areas in large quantities. At the same time, due to stable prices and the increasing credibility of RMB, the majority of farmers have fundamentally reversed the mentality of valuing goods over money that has persisted for more than a decade, and are happy to engage in monetary transactions and store money. According to statistics, Zhejiang Province's purchase of spring tea and spring cocoons, through one hundred and fifty cocoon purchasing stations and thirty tea purchasing stations, has resulted in a large amount of RMB flowing into the tea and cocoon producing areas. Of this amount, only about 40% has been recovered through cooperatives and specialized companies. The ongoing purchase of rapeseed and other native and special products is also prompting a large amount of RMB to flow into rural areas. The influx of RMB into rural areas has greatly enlivened the markets in rural towns in tea and cocoon producing areas, and prices have not fluctuated as a result. Bartering has decreased accordingly in tea and cocoon producing areas. For example, in Changle Town, Sheng County, a tea-producing area, the total amount of RMB circulating in the market was about 4 million yuan in February and March, and it had increased to 12 million in May. The local joint venture store did much better business in the second half of May than in the first half, but the amount of rice received from door-to-door sales in the first half of the month was 5,113 catties and 10 taels, while in the second half it had decreased to 816 catties and 1 tael, which means that the proportion of transactions in currency had increased. When silkworms in Sixi Township, Wuxing, were in their second or third sleep stage, the price of mulberry leaves was calculated in rice, 1 dou of rice per 100 catties. But when the silkworms were in their fourth sleep stage, the price of mulberry leaves was calculated in RMB, 20,000 yuan per 100 catties. Farmers cherish and store the RMB they have earned with their sweat, not only keeping it themselves, but also depositing it in banks. For example, the Huzhou branch of the People's Bank of China and its various offices, in conjunction with the cocoon purchasing work, launched publicity campaigns and organized farmers' principal-protected and value-maintained deposits. In just five days from June 3rd to 7th, they received deposits from 587 farmers, totaling 141.32 million yuan.
    In addition, during this tea and cocoon purchasing work, grain, general merchandise and other specialized companies simultaneously supplied tea farmers and silkworm farmers with grain, fertilizer and various general merchandise and fabrics at appropriate prices. In addition to entrusting cooperatives and private stores to sell on their behalf, the grain and general merchandise companies themselves specially set up fifty sales stations and mobile sales teams, so that tea farmers and silkworm farmers could buy the items they needed at appropriate prices after selling their tea cocoons, at most within ten li. This further convinced farmers of the value of RMB and encouraged them to cherish it.

　　浙省大力收购茶茧土产
    人民币逐步流入农村
    专业公司配合下乡供应农民必需品
    【杭州讯】浙江日报消息：浙江各地由于政府大力收购茶、茧等土产和特产，人民币已大量地逐步流入农村。同时由于物价稳定，人民币信用日益提高，广大农民基本上已扭转了十余年来的重货轻币心理，乐于进行货币交易并储存货币。据统计，浙江省收购春茶春茧，通过一百五十个收茧站与三十个收茶站，流入各茶茧产区的大量人民币，其中通过各合作社与专业公司回笼的仅占百分之四十。正在进行的菜籽和其他土产和特产的收购工作也促使大量人民币流入了农村。这批人民币的流入农村，大大地活跃了茶茧产区农村集镇的市场，物价亦未因此而波动。以物易物的交换情形在茶茧产区已随之减少。例如茶叶产区嵊县长乐镇，二、三月份市面上流通的人民币总数约四百万元，五月份已增至一千二百万。当地的联营商店，五月下半月的生意比上半月好得多，但上半月门市卖货收进的稻谷有五千一百十三斤十两，而下半月则已减至八百十六斤一两，亦即以货币成交的比例提高了。吴兴思溪乡当蚕养到二三眠的时候，还以米计算桑叶价格，一斗米一百斤，而到蚕四眠后就以人民币计算桑价，两万元一百斤。农民珍惜地储藏他们用血汗换来的人民币，不仅自己藏，有的还存到银行里去。如人民银行湖州支行及各办事处，结合收茧工作，展开宣传，举办了农民保本保值存款，仅六月三日到七日五天功夫，就收进五百八十七个农民的存款，共计一亿四千一百三十二万元。
    此外，在这次茶茧收购工作中，粮食、百货等专业公司同时以适当的价格供应茶农蚕农以粮食、肥料和各种百货布匹。除委托合作社与私营商店代售外，单粮食、百货公司本身，就特地设立了五十个出售站和流动出售组，使茶农蚕农在出卖茶茧后，至多不出十里路就可按适当价格买到所需的物品。因而使农民进一步相信人民币、珍视人民币。
