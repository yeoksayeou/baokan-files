Xinhua News Agency, 18th: "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 36 (Overall Issue 75) of the Chinese edition has been published here. The editorial in this issue is titled "Strive for the Signature of the Broad Masses on the Appeal for the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons." The editorial states: Launching a mass, nationwide movement demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, and striving for millions of people to sign the peace appeal, is the central task of the current struggle for peace. It would be a great mistake for anyone to think that any signature cannot prevent war and protect peaceful residents from being wiped out by atomic bombs. Signing the appeal condemning atomic weapons is not just many lists, lists of representatives of Soviets and Americans, British and Germans, French and Poles, Chinese and Japanese, and other nations around the world. The signature will express the firm will and determination of millions of people – workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other people's strata – to defend peace. In the current situation, this will of all nations and the active actions of peace fighters are of particular importance. The editorial pointed out: Maintaining the interests of peace, the vital interests of all progressive humanity, requires this movement to have a much larger scale and organization. Promoting the peace signature movement should be, at present, the central issue for all democratic groups in the struggle for peace. Every gathering, every demonstration, and all mass work methods must be used to strengthen the peace signature movement. All social organizations – trade unions, women's, youth, veterans' groups, cultural and educational institutions, cooperatives, etc. – should actively participate in this movement. The responsibility and obligation of all sincere peace advocates and the entire progressive press is to redouble their efforts to make everyone aware of the appeal for the prohibition of atomic weapons, to ensure that this appeal is spread to every corner of the earth, to explain its significance, thereby causing the war instigators' plans to suffer fatal blows.
　　
This issue of the journal published an article written by Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of Spain. The article briefly discusses the history of the Communist Party of Spain's struggle. The article states: Since the failure of the Republic, the Communist Party – which has never considered this a final failure – has made its best efforts to restore the unity of the working class and all anti-Franco forces. The Communist Party of Spain, trained in the school of Stalin's revolutionary struggle, loyal to the working class, and to the oppressed and exploited classes, is now doing its utmost to continue its activities in Spain and among expatriates abroad. The Communist Party of Spain now has greater persistence and consistency than in 1933 and 1935, and they are contributing and will continue to contribute their strength in the struggle to unite the working class and all anti-Franco forces, not only to fight for the revival of the Republic, but also to prevent Spain from becoming a war base for Anglo-American war instigators. The article pointed out: The Communist Party of Spain faces two main tasks arising from the domestic and international situation: The first is to constantly fight to defend the peace threatened by Anglo-American warmongers, because the struggle for peace is closely linked to the struggle for a republican and democratic Spain. The second is to fight for the unity of the working class, for the unity of anti-Franco forces, and for the establishment of a National Republican Democratic Front.
　　
In addition, this issue of the journal also published the report "The New Situation and the Policies of the Japanese Communist Party" made by Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, at the 18th Enlarged Central Committee Meeting of the Japanese Communist Party in January this year, and the letter to the French people from the 12th Congress of the French Communist Party, etc.

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》
    中文版第三十六期介绍
    【新华社十八日讯】《争取持久和平，争取人民民主!》中文版第三十六期（总第七十五期）已在此间出版。本期社论题为“争取广大人民在禁止原子武器的呼吁书上签名”。社论说：展开群众性的全民要求禁止原子武器运动，争取数以百万计的群众在和平呼吁书上签名，乃是目前争取和平斗争的中心任务。如果有人认为任何签名都不能防止战争和保卫和平居民不被原子弹消灭，那就大大地错了。在谴责原子武器的呼吁书上签名，这不仅是许多张名单，苏联人与美国人、英国人与德国人、法国人与波兰人、中国人与日本人，以及全世界其他各民族代表的名单。签名将表示出千百万人——工人、农民、知识分子以及其他人民阶层——保卫和平的坚定意志与决心。在目前情况下，各族人民的这一意志与和平战士的积极行动，具有特别重要的意义。社论指出：维护和平的利益，全体进步人类的切身利益，要求这一运动有更大得多的规模和组织性。推动和平签名运动，在目前，应该是一切民主团体为和平而斗争的中心问题。必须利用每一个集会，每一次示威，一切群众工作方法，来加强和平签名运动。一切社会团体——工会、妇女、青年、退伍军人的团体，文教机关，合作社等等都应该积极参加这个运动。全体真诚的和平拥护者与整个进步报刊的责任和义务，就是十倍地加紧努力，使每一个人都知道关于禁止原子武器的呼吁书，保证把这个呼吁书传到地球的各角落，解释它的意义，从而使战争挑拨者的计划蒙受致受的打击。
    该刊本期发表了西班牙共产党总书记伊巴露丽为纪念西班牙共产党三十周年而写的一篇文章。该文扼要地论述了西班牙共产党的斗争历史。该文说：自从共和国失败以后，共产党——它从来没有认为这是最后的失败——尽了最大努力，使工人阶级与一切反佛朗哥的力量之团结恢复起来。在斯大林的革命斗争的学校里受过锻炼的，对工人阶级、对被压迫被剥削的阶级效忠的西班牙共产党，现在正竭尽全力地继续在西班牙和国外侨民间进行他们的活动。西班牙共产党现在有着较一九三三年和一九三五年更大的坚持性和一贯性，他们正在并将继续在团结工人阶级和一切反佛朗哥力量的斗争中贡献出他的力量，不仅为复兴共和国而奋斗，而且为防止西班牙成为英美战争煽动者的战争基地而奋斗。该文指出：西班牙共产党面对着由国内和国际局势所产生的两个主要任务：第一是不断地为保卫受着英美战争贩子威胁的和平而斗争，因为争取和平的斗争，是与争取共和的民主的西班牙的斗争紧密地联系着的。第二是为工人阶级的团结，为反佛朗哥的力量的团结，为成立全国共和民主阵线而奋斗。
    此外，该刊本期并登载了日共总书记德田球一今年一月间在日共第十八次扩大中央委员会会议上所作的“新的形势与日本共产党的政策”的报告，和法国共产党第十二次代表大会告法国人民书等。
