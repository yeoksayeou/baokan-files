　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch: The "Labor Daily" recently published an article by Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, discussing the current tasks of the World Federation of Trade Unions, stating: All the resolutions passed by the Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Budapest serve the struggle to defend peace. The main task facing the world labor movement is to ensure that the working people of all countries obtain lasting and solid peace. As the Executive Committee pointed out, all trade union organizations must fight against the arms race and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

　　Saillant emphasized: The World Federation of Trade Unions must, without delay, unite the working people of the United States, Britain, the Scandinavian countries, and other countries where the peace movement has not reached the necessary breadth, into the ranks of active supporters of peace. Participating in the peace signature campaign will help to establish unity between the workers of the United States and Britain and their worker brothers in other countries. Only by adopting measures to strengthen the unity of the working people and resolutely protect their rights in every enterprise can the workers of the United States, Britain, and other countries overcome the consequences of the treacherous divisive activities carried out by labor traitors in those countries.

　　赛扬论世界工联当前任务
    广泛团结各国劳动人民  到保卫和平的队伍中来
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报顷刊载世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬所著一文，论述世界工联的当前任务称：世界工联布达佩斯执委会会议所通过的一切决议，都是服务于保卫和平的斗争的。世界工人运动所面临的主要任务，就是确保各国劳动人民得到持久与巩固的和平。正如执委会所指出的，一切工会组织都必须为反对军备竞赛与禁止原子武器而斗争。
    赛扬着重指出：世界工联必须毫不迟延地把美国、英国、斯堪的纳维亚国家以及其他和平运动尚未达到应有广泛程度的国家的劳动人民，团结到积极拥护和平者的队伍中来。参与和平签名运动，必将有助于建立美国和英国的工人兄弟与其他国家的工人兄弟之间的团结。只有采取加强劳动人民团结以及在每一企业中坚决保护他们权利的办法，美国、英国和其他若干国家的劳工，才能克服各该国工贼罪恶地进行分裂活动所造成的后果。
