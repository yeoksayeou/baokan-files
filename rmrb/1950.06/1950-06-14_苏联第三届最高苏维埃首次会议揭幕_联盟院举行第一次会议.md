Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 13th: The first session of the Third Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened on the 12th in the Kremlin. The Soviet of the Union held its first meeting at 5 p.m.
　　
Guests attending the meeting included diplomatic missions from various countries, workers in industry, representatives from the fields of science, art, and literature, and representatives of the working people of Moscow.
　　
As Soviet leaders Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Khrushchev, Shvernik, Suslov, and Ponomarenko took their seats on the presidium, thunderous applause resounded throughout the hall.
　　
The delegates accepted the suggestion of delegate Ivan Rumyantsev to invite one of the oldest delegates, the President of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Alexander Baradin, to preside over the opening ceremony of the first meeting.
　　
In his opening address, Baradin stated: The first session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is convened at a moment of great significance. At this time, the Soviet state is completing and surpassing the Stalin post-war Five-Year Plan. The power of the Soviet country is growing day by day, and its international prestige is increasing. The progressive forces of the world are gathering around it. The achievements of our working people in restoring and further developing the national economy vividly demonstrate to the world once again the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. All nationalities are increasingly convinced that there is only one road leading to freedom and happiness, leading to world peace – the road of socialism. Our socialist motherland leads the powerful international camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. This camp has become the greatest force. The guarantee of this force is the great leader Stalin.
　　
After Baradin finished his speech, cheers resounded throughout the hall in praise of Comrade Stalin, the great organizer and inspirer of the victories of the Soviet people.
　　
The meeting then unanimously elected Mikhail Yasnov, Chairman of the Moscow Soviet, as Chairman of the Soviet of the Union and discussed the proposal to increase the number of Deputy Chairmen of the Soviet of the Union to four instead of the two Deputy Chairmen stipulated in the Constitution. This proposal stemmed from the need for broader contact between the leadership of the Soviet of the Union and the delegates. The meeting passed this proposal and decided to make corresponding amendments to the Constitution. Subsequently, delegates Alexei Kirichenko, Tatyana Zhuyeva, Antanas Sniečkus, and Yamin Niyazov were elected as Deputy Chairmen of the Soviet of the Union.
　　
The congress then adopted the following agenda: 1. Election of the Credentials Committee of the Soviet of the Union. 2. Election of the Standing Committees of the Soviet of the Union. 3. Approval of the decrees promulgated by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. 4. Election of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. 5. Formation of the Soviet government – the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. 6. Approval of the Soviet Union's national budget for 1950 and report on the implementation of the budget for 1948-1949.
　　
The meeting delegates carried out the first and second items on the agenda on the 12th, electing a Credentials Committee of seventeen members to review the credentials of the delegates of the Soviet of the Union; and electing the Standing Committees of the Soviet of the Union: the Legislative Proposals Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Foreign Affairs Committee.
