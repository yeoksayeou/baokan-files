　　Rongcheng People Dissatisfied with Delayed Dike Repair Fees; Hebei Water Conservancy Bureau Should Resolve Quickly

　　Last August and December, when the government blocked the breaches in the Chenyangzhuang dike section of the Juma River and the Zhaocun section of the Daqing River in Rongcheng County, Hebei Province, it used a total of over one million catties of rice (which did not exceed the budget). At that time, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau only allocated more than 600,000 catties of rice, owing the masses over 400,000 catties of rice for piling materials, firewood, and wages, which has not been returned to this day. The masses are very dissatisfied with this matter. At each county people's representative meeting, villages raise this issue, but it has not been resolved. When the masses went to the district, the district cadres said, "We have requested instructions from the county, but there has been no reply." The county pushes it to the province, and the province pushes it to the central government, saying, "When reporting the total accounts to the central government, we forgot about this account, and we have to ask the central government again, and we don't know how to resolve it." (This is what the person sent by the county to negotiate with the province said upon his return).

　　According to comrades in the Rongcheng County government, on February 14th of this year, the county government sent Wen Xingge, a clerk from the Agriculture and Forestry Section, and Zhang Pu, from the Water Conservancy Bureau, to the Tianjin Water Conservancy Bureau to report the accounts. Because the accounts were not classified, the comrades at the Water Conservancy Bureau said that they must be clarified before they can be reimbursed. Comrades Wen and Zhang worked there for more than twenty days. Later, because of the lack of original receipts (there were notes issued by the dike blocking committee, but no receipts from the original sellers of piling materials and firewood, or from those who had not received wages), the accounts were still not reimbursed. They returned to the county on March 17th. Because the Water Conservancy Bureau did not tell them when the accounts had to be cleared, they put the matter aside after returning. In April, they suddenly received an order from the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, forwarded by the Daqing River Bureau, which roughly stated: "For the dike blocking budget approved in 1949, if the funds have not been received or only partially received, they will no longer be issued; those who have received the funds, if the receipts are not submitted quickly, will be considered as not having been spent and will be treated as the balance for the next year." After the county received the order, it clarified the accounts according to the procedures and reported them to the Water Conservancy Bureau for reimbursement. The Water Conservancy Bureau said, "When reporting to the Central Ministry of Water Conservancy, we forgot about your account, so we have to ask the central government again and wait for instructions." Therefore, this account has been delayed until now.

　　Rongcheng suffered from floods last year, and the lives of the masses are very difficult. When blocking the river dike breaches last year, Chenyangzhuang village alone owed the masses more than 300 piles, equivalent to more than 20,000 catties of rice; in Nanwenying village, one large poplar tree three zhang long and one elm tree one zhang eight long were bought from Li Baozhong's family, and not a single grain of rice has been given to this day. His family has a total of seven people, and their lives are very difficult. Now, people go to the district and county governments every day to demand these outstanding payments.

　　We believe that this matter has not been resolved well, and the Rongcheng County Dike Blocking Committee should be held responsible, because it did not establish accounts according to the prescribed procedures and did not seize the time to deal with it in advance. The Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau pushes it again and again, and is not responsible for the interests of the masses, which is a concrete manifestation of bureaucracy. In any case, this money should be repaid. Therefore, we suggest that the Rongcheng County Government, the Daqing River Affairs Bureau, and the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau should quickly resolve this issue.

### 容城民众不满拖欠修堤费  河北水利局应赶快解决

　　容城民众不满拖欠修堤费  河北水利局应赶快解决
    去年八月与十二月，政府在河北容城县堵塞拒马河陈杨庄堤段及大清河赵村段两道决口时，总计用米一百余万斤（并未超过预算）。当时省水利局只拨给了六十余万斤米，欠下群众的桩料、柴料、工资等合米四十余万斤，到现在还没归还。群众对这件事非常不满。在每次县人民代表会上，各村都提出这一问题，但到现在尚未解决。群众找到区里，区干部说：“已向县里请示尚未答复”；县推给省，省又推到中央，说“向中央报总账时忘了这笔账，只有再行请示中央，还不知如何解决。”（这是县里派去省里交涉的人回来说的）。
    据容城县政府的同志说，今年二月十四日，县政府曾派农林科员文星阁及水利局张普二同志去天津水利局报账。因为账目没有分类，水利局的同志说：必须搞清才能报销。文张二同志便在那里搞了二十多天。后来又因缺少原来的单据（有堵口委员会开的条子，而没有原卖桩料、柴料及未领工资者的单据），还是没有把账报了。他们便于三月十七日回了县。因为水利局并没有告诉他们必须在什么时候报清，他们回来后便把这事搁下了。至四月间忽接大清河河务局转来省水利局一道命令，大意是说：一九四九年已批准之堵口预算，如尚未领款或只领到一部分的，一律不再发给；已领款者，如单据不赶紧交来，即认为尚未开支，作为下年度的存额。县里接到命令后，即按手续将账弄清，到水利局报销。水利局说：“向中央水利部报结时，忘记了你们这笔账，只好再向中央请示，听候处理。”因此这笔账一直迟延到现在。
    容城去年遭受水灾，群众生活非常困苦。去年堵塞河堤决口时，如陈杨庄一个村即欠群众三百多棵桩，合两万多斤米；在南文营村，买李宝忠家一棵三丈长的大杨树、一棵一丈八的榆树，至现在一粒米也没给。他全家共有七口人，生活非常困难。现在每天都有人到区、县政府要这些欠款。
    我们认为，这件事情没有很好解决，容城县堵口委员会是应该负责的，因为它没按规定手续立账，事先没有抓紧时间处理。省水利局一推再推，对群众利益不负责任，这是官僚主义的具体表现。无论如何这笔款是应该还的。因此我们建议容城县政府，大清河务局及省水利局，应该赶紧解决这一问题。
