[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Public Security Bureau arrested and prosecuted eleven counter-revolutionary Yiguandao heads and bandit special agents, including Liu Xieyuan, on the 7th. Liu Xieyuan was a Yiguandao altar master who served as the head of the puppet Lianbao during the Japanese puppet regime and murdered four anti-Japanese guerrillas. After the Japanese surrender, he joined the Central Statistics Bureau (CC Clique) special agent organization as a central group leader. Mu Zhaozeng was a Yiguandao follower, a Kuomintang member, and came from a background as a local tyrant and landlord. During the Japanese puppet period, he served as the director of the puppet Qingmiao Association and the head of the Bao, and later as a member of the Kuomintang Anti-Communist Committee, colluding with the enemy to murder three Liberation Army soldiers. Chen Qixiang was a Yiguandao altar master who served as the president of the Japanese puppet Maintenance Association, the head of the Bao, and the supervisor of the Xinmin Association. Later, he joined the Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau. Bai Xiuru was a Yiguandao altar master who organized a "violence squad" specializing in luring young men to rape young women and framed our revolutionary cadres before liberation. Liu Jingtai was a Yiguandao preacher who served as the head of the puppet Bao and later joined the Sanqing Corps and the Central Statistics Bureau, serving as an intelligence officer of the Puppet New Beijing Third Branch. Lü Shanting was a Yiguandao altar master who served as the head of the Japanese puppet railway protection team, village chief, and special agent for the Japanese military police. In 1948, he joined the Central Statistics Bureau and served as the leader of a commando team. Zhang Baoyuan was a Yiguandao altar master who was a bandit and served as the chief of the economic section of the Beijing Police Department during the Japanese puppet period. Zhang Renwei was a Yiguandao preacher who served as the commander of the garrison of the six counties of eastern Hebei under the puppet regime, and later colluded with the Kuomintang to continue his evil deeds. Liu Linge was a Yiguandao preacher who specialized in using preaching to fool followers and spread rumors to confuse the public. Lü Hanqing was a Yiguandao altar master who served as the head of the puppet Bao and the Xinmin Association president, and in 1948, he joined the Central Statistics Bureau as a central group leader. Sun Hongliang was a Yiguandao follower who served as the director of the Third Branch of the Fifth District of the Puppet Outer City and a member of the Xinmin Association in 1941. Later, he developed a relationship with Ma Hansan, the head of the Military Statistics Bureau special agents, and also joined the Kuomintang. He ran rampant in the Tianqiao area and has long been hated by the masses. The above-mentioned criminals have been carrying out counter-revolutionary activities under the cover of the Taoist organization. During the Anti-Japanese War, they colluded with the enemy and puppet regimes to undermine the resistance against Japan, and later colluded with the Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau to persecute the people. After liberation, these criminals continued to carry out counter-revolutionary conspiracies, such as printing and distributing reactionary leaflets, using divination to spread rumors to confuse the public; and further undermining land reform, sabotaging production and construction, and disrupting social order, with countless crimes. In order to protect the interests of the people and maintain social order, the Beijing Public Security Bureau arrested them according to law and will prosecute them or give them the opportunity for labor reform based on their crimes and the degree of their confession. (Publicity)

The Beijing Public Security Bureau cracked a major special agent sabotage operation on the 7th. The ringleaders Gang Tiedong, Wang Wenya, Kang Yafan and more than ten others were all arrested. When the Public Security Bureau arrested the above-mentioned criminals, they also seized pistols and reactionary documents and other physical evidence. This group of special agent bandits formed gangs and carried out covert activities in Beijing, plotting to sabotage certain military facilities, spying on military and political intelligence, and printing counterfeit money. They also vainly attempted to carry out armed "guerrilla" activities in Beijing and its suburbs when the time was ripe. The Beijing Public Security Bureau learned of the above situation and arrested them all. After preliminary interrogation, Bandit Gang and others confessed to all kinds of crimes. Bandit Gang Tiedong used the aliases Jiang Changjiang and Li Gang, and served as the leader of the intelligence and action team of the Chiang Kai-shek’s Shenyang Security Bureau with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and the leader of the group of the Second Division of the Puppet Northeast Headquarters with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Bandit Wang Wenya served as the commander of the pistol battalion of Jiang Bandit Wang Fenggang's troops. Bandit Kang Yafan served as the deputy group leader of the bandit Central Statistics Bureau. These bandits were all die-hard special agents who had long opposed the people. The Public Security Bureau arrested them after confirming the facts through investigation.

Furthermore, the Beijing Public Security Bureau arrested seventeen special agent elements, including Zhu Zhenxin, on the 7th for registering with the government on one hand and continuing to carry out counter-revolutionary conspiracies on the other. Zhu Bandit Zhenxin, who had served as a member of the puppet North China Political Affairs Committee's Anti-Communist Committee, president of the Xinmin Association, and major group member of the Second Department of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, was very dishonest during registration, feigning compliance while acting in opposition, failing to hand over information about the organization, and continuing to carry out conspiracies after registration. Wu Bandit Jianshan, who had served as an executive member of the Kuomintang District Party Department and a member of the Anti-Communist Vanguard, continued to win over workers who had participated in the Kuomintang to undermine the trade union organization after registration. Jia Bandit Bohou, who had worked as a staff member of the Security Bureau, continued to commit robberies in the Outer Fifth District after registration. Yan Special Agent Li Qirui never handed over information about the organization during registration. It was not until he was arrested this time that the list of Yan Special Agent's organization and credentials were found in his home. The other bandits, such as Military Statistics Bureau special agents An Bangfu, Wu Dazheng, Lu Chengye, Hou Wenbin, Central Statistics Bureau special agents Lei Baoshan, Man Xin’san, Pan Junbao, Party Statistics Bureau special agent Zhang Guichun, specialist of the Political Work Bureau of the puppet Ministry of National Defense Liu Xiaoshen, probationary warrant officer of the Military Police Special High Team Liu Ziliang, secretary of the Kuomintang District Party Department Xu Zhaolin, and chief of staff of Wang Fenggang's bandit troops Liu Fumin, continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities even after registration. In order to enforce national laws and discipline, the Beijing Public Security Bureau arrested the above-mentioned criminals.
