Title: Leading Organs at All Levels Should Effectively Utilize Radio Broadcasting

Radio broadcasting is one of the most powerful tools for mass propaganda and education. The Chinese people's own radio broadcasting事业 (shìyè - undertaking, cause, enterprise), from its creation to the present, has been less than five years. However, due to the great victory of the People's Liberation War, it has developed rapidly in the past year or so. There are now a total of fifty-one People's Broadcasting Stations in the country, and a considerable number of regular listeners. Many provinces and cities have established or are establishing radio networks. Thousands of broadcasting workers have accumulated some experience in connecting with the masses and conducting propaganda and mobilization work. The prestige of the people's radio among the masses has also begun to grow. All of these have given our people's broadcasting事业 (shìyè) considerable material conditions, making it possible to carry out propaganda and education work on a large scale.

Experience over the past year or so has proven that radio broadcasting, as an important tool for mass propaganda and education, has great potential. Especially in our country's current situation of inconvenient transportation, numerous illiterate people, and insufficient newspapers, if we are good at using it, it can play a huge role. The report on radio work in Hebei and Chahar provinces published in this newspaper today is a thought-provoking example.

However, because the broadcasting事业 (shìyè) appeared relatively late, the role it plays is still not very significant. Until now, this事业 (shìyè) has not received the due and sufficient attention it deserves. When we were in the countryside, our leading organs at all levels already had the habit of using newspapers for propaganda and education, and to promote and improve work. Recently, they have also used news agencies to a relatively limited extent. But they still do not quite understand the performance of radio broadcasting and rarely use this modern new weapon.

Even the propaganda and education organs generally are not good at using broadcasting. For example, we are now facing such a situation in propaganda and education work: the whole country is surging with a wave of learning; the new cadres, who account for a large proportion of the cadres, the old cadres, mostly of worker-peasant origin with a lower cultural level, and the vast number of intellectuals in the new areas are all eager to improve themselves in theory or culture. The laboring people in the new areas who are not highly conscious, and the laboring people in the old areas after land reform, also have an urgent demand for learning. In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, ensure the country's economic construction, and welcome the upcoming high tide of cultural construction, it is necessary to meet the requirements of all these people. This is an urgent and important task at present. At this time, it is best for us to recall Lenin's words. In his letter to all members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in May 1922, he said:

"I think that both from the point of view of propaganda and agitation, and for the purpose of broadcasting learning lectures, it is absolutely necessary to realize this plan (referring to the plan of 'maximizing the promotion of well-equipped loudspeakers and establishing millions of radios throughout the republic'), especially for the illiterate people. ... We have no other way but to have the few Communists who are good at teaching social sciences lecture to hundreds of cities scattered throughout the republic."

But how do some of our propaganda and education organs now meet the learning requirements of the masses? They did not think of using radio stations as huge classrooms that can teach tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of people at the same time, but only spend great efforts in a handicraft manner to organize large classes or lectures that can only accommodate dozens, hundreds, or at most a few thousand people; and our good lecturers, who are already few in number, are exhausted and overwhelmed, and as a result, only a very small number of people can be satisfied.

Radio broadcasting is also an excellent tool for disseminating news, issuing government orders, exchanging experiences, and providing legitimate entertainment. There was such a thing in Northwest China: the government's instructions on spring plowing were published in the newspaper, but by the time the newspaper was delivered to remote areas, spring plowing had already passed. If this instruction were issued through radio stations and radio networks, then the entire region could follow the same instruction without exception. We believe that after the major administrative regions implement the News Administration's decision on establishing radio and receiving networks, our propaganda and education work will usher in a great situation unprecedented in thousands of years: every order or instruction of the Central People's Government, or every important domestic and foreign news item, can be transmitted to more than two thousand counties and cities across the country on the same day, and can be transmitted to local cadres, troops, and the broad masses of people in a timely manner through various forms such as small newspapers, express newspapers, mimeographed newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and rooftop broadcasting. The speed and ubiquity of radio broadcasting are indeed of greater significance for our country, which is vast and has inconvenient transportation.

Similarly, in the land reform that will be implemented this year, which involves 300 million people, if the leading organs in various places, in addition to adopting methods such as telephones, telegrams, meetings, instructions, reports, briefings, people coming and going, and letters, also make full use of broadcasting, and systematically broadcast special programs to the land reform army in the front through the radio network, then the radio station and its radio network will be the most flexible tool for the head office to command operations. Utilizing this modern weapon can greatly facilitate the close connection between the head office and the lower levels, the transmission of orders, the exchange of experiences, the control of movements, the correction of policies, and the prevention of deviations, and will greatly improve work efficiency.

We live in the age of radio, and we must make full use of this new weapon. Therefore, leading organs at all levels should promptly implement the decision of the News Administration on establishing radio and receiving networks, and fully and comprehensively use broadcasting to promote and improve work. We also suggest that propaganda organs at all levels should pay more attention to and strengthen the leadership of broadcasting and radio network work, regularly review its work plan, equip it with appropriate cadres, and ensure that its content has a high level of political awareness. Caring for and leading broadcasting work should be one of the important daily tasks of propaganda organs at all levels.

### 各级领导机关应当有效地利用无线电广播

　　各级领导机关应当有效地利用无线电广播
    无线电广播事业是群众性宣传教育的最有力工具之一。中国人民自己的无线电广播事业，从创立到现在，还不满五年。但是，由于人民解放战争的伟大胜利，一年多来，它已有迅速的发展。全国现在共有五十一座人民广播电台，并有相当数量的经常听众。许多省、市已经成立了或正在成立收音网。几千个广播工作者在联系群众和进行宣传鼓动工作方面，已积累了一些经验。人民广播在群众中的威信，也开始增长起来。所有这些，使我们的人民广播事业具备了相当的物质条件，有可能去执行巨大规模的宣传教育工作。
    一年多以来，经验证明了，无线电广播作为群众性宣传教育的重要工具，存在着极大的可能性。特别是在我国目前交通不便、文盲众多、报纸不足的条件下，如果我们善于利用它，它可以发挥极大的作用。今天本报发表的冀察两省收音工作的报道，就是一些富有启发性的实例。
    但是，由于广播事业出现较迟，它所发挥的作用还较不显著。直到现在，这一事业还没有得到应有的足够的重视。在农村的时候，我们各级的领导机关，就已有了利用报纸来进行宣传教育和推动、改进工作的习惯。最近也比较有限度地利用了通讯社。但是他们还不大懂得无线电广播的性能，还很少利用这个现代化的新式武器。
    就是宣传教育机关，一般地也还不善于利用广播。例如，现在我们在宣传教育工作上正面临着这样的一种情况：全国激荡着学习的热潮；在干部中占极大比重的质量不高的新干部，大部分工农出身的文化水平较低的老干部，新区广大的智识青年，都迫切要求在理论上或文化上提高一步。觉悟不高的新区劳动人民，和土改之后的老区劳动人民，也都有着迫切的学习要求。为着巩固人民民主专政，保证国家的经济建设和迎接行将到来的文化建设的高潮，就必须满足所有这些人的要求。这是目前一个紧急而重大的任务。在这时候，我们最好回忆一下列宁的话，他在一九二二年五月给联共中央政治局全体委员的信中，曾这样说：
    “我想无论从宣传鼓动的观点来看，无论是为了播送学习讲座，都有实现这个计划（按指《最大限度地促进装置优良的扩音器和在全共和国设立千万个收音机的工作》的计划）的绝对必要性，特别是对于不识字的人民来说。……除了使我们善于讲授社会科学的少数共产主义者教授，给散处共和国各方的数百个城市播讲讲座之外，我们再没有别的办法可想了。”
    可是我们的一些宣教机关现在怎样来满足群众的学习要求呢？他们并没有想到利用广播电台这个可以同时教授几万人、几十万人、甚至几百万人的巨大课堂，而只是手工业方式地花费极大力气去组织只能容纳几十人、几百人、至多也只有几千人的大课或是讲演会；而我们为数本来就很少的好讲师，虽然唇焦舌敝，疲于奔命，结果也只能使极少数的人得到满足。
    无线电广播在传布新闻，下达政令，交流经验和提供正当的娱乐等方面，也是极出色的工具。西北有过这样的事情，政府关于春耕的指示发表在报上，但当报纸送到边远地区时，春耕业已过去。如果这一指示经过广播台和收音网下达，那么全区就可以毫无例外地按照同一指示办事。我们相信，各大行政区实现了新闻总署关于建立广播收音网的决定之后，我们的宣传教育工作，将出现几千年来所未有的伟大局面：中央人民政府的每一个命令或指示，或是每一个重要的国内外新闻，都可以在当天传到全国的二千多个县市，并通过小报、快报、油印报、黑板报和屋顶广播种种形式，及时地传达给当地的干部、部队和广大人民。无线电广播的迅速和无远不届，对于幅员辽阔和交通不便的我国，确实有着更其重要的意义。
    同样，在今年即将实行的关系三万万人口的土地改革中，各地领导机关，如果除了采取电话、电报、开会、指示、报告、汇报、人来人往、信来信往等等方式之外，又充分利用了广播，有计划地通过收音网，向前方土改大军播送专门的节目，那么，广播电台及其收音网，将是首脑机关用来指挥作战的最灵活的工具。利用了这一现代化的武器，在密切首脑机关与下级的联系，在传达命令、交流经验、掌握运动、端正政策、制止偏向等等方面，都可以得到极大的便利，并将大大提高工作的效率。
    我们是生活在无线电的时代，我们必须充分利用这一新式的武器。因此，各级领导机关，应当迅速执行新闻总署关于建立广播收音网的决定，充分地和多方面地利用广播来推动和改进工作。我们又建议各级宣传机关，要更多地关心和加强对广播和收音网工作的领导，要经常审查它的工作计划，配备适当的干部，和保证它的内容有着高度的政治水平。关心和领导广播工作，应是各级宣传机关的重要日常事务之一。
