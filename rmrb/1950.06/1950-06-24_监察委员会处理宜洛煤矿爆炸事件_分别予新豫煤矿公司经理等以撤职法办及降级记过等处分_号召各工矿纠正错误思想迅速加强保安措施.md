Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:
The People's Supervisory Committee of the Government Administration Council issued a circular regarding the handling of the "February 27th" methane gas explosion disaster at the Yiluo Coal Mine of the Henan Xin Yu Coal Mine Company. The full text is as follows:

(I) Disaster Losses and Aftermath:
The Yiluo Coal Mine of the Henan State-owned Xin Yu Coal Mine Company is located seventy li southwest of Luoyang. The coal quality of this mine is good, with estimated reserves of 220 million tons and a coal seam thickness of over 20 meters. After the complete liberation of Henan in 1948, the Yu Xi Administrative Office sent Zhang Jingru as manager to take over in September, and it officially started work on October 3rd, starting coal production on January 1st of the following year.

At 18:45 on February 27th of this year, a methane gas explosion disaster occurred in the mine. The area affected by the explosion was 10,600 square meters, accounting for more than one-third of the total underground area. Final statistics: 174 workers died (including 12 who died from serious injuries), 2 were disabled, and 24 were slightly injured (now recovered). The estimated loss is a reduction of 4,000 tons in production (calculated based on a daily production of 100 tons and a 40-day shutdown); plus burial, compensation, and repair project costs, the total is equivalent to over 1.8 million jin of wheat. After the disaster occurred, the mine established a post-disaster committee and mobilized employees to actively rescue; the Luoyang Prefectural Office, Yiyang County Government, and the local garrison Independent Regiment 11 all sent doctors to rush to the rescue. The injured were treated on the spot, the dead were coffined and buried, and condolences were given to the families of the deceased and the injured. The Henan Provincial People's Government, the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Heavy Industry Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee, the Central Fuel Industry Department, the Ministry of Labor, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the National Coal Miners' Union, and the Central People's Supervisory Committee all sent personnel to the mine to express condolences and assist in the repair work and post-disaster work.

(II) Causes of the Disaster:
(A) Direct cause: The coal seam of the mine contained a large amount of methane gas. Because it was mined using indigenous methods with natural ventilation, most of its engineering did not meet standards. Every time between spring and summer and between summer and autumn, the wind pressure sometimes reached equilibrium, the airflow was not smooth, and methane gas accumulated. When encountering an open flame, an explosion would occur. In addition, the mine had suffered serious damage from previous disasters and serious destruction by the Chiang bandits before liberation, and the engineering equipment was dilapidated. Under these unfavorable objective conditions, the mine workers habitually smoked underground. According to inspection, it was generally determined that the direct cause of this disaster was an explosion caused by workers striking a match and smoking underground.

(B) Errors in work: This disaster was not accidental but was caused by the mine's failure to implement the "safe production" policy determined by the National Coal Mine Conference, the unclear understanding of relying on the working class, and the commission of serious bureaucratic work style. To investigate the reasons:
(1) The guiding ideology had a purely business perspective, blindly pursuing production figures. Last year, on the "May 1st" Labor Day, the Yiyang County Government sent people to the mine to launch a "production competition," and the highest daily output reached 302 tons (the actual daily production capacity was around 100 tons, and the rest was stolen by destroying engineering), causing serious phenomena such as roof collapse, spalling, and collapse of support structures and damage to high vehicles. The mine not only did not pay attention to this but also blindly launched "model selection campaigns" and "production competition campaigns" in July and November. Last November, it blindly stipulated excessive reward standards, competed for three days, the project was severely damaged, and labor discipline was fundamentally abandoned. The leading cadres of the mine were not alert, did not ask about it, or thought that "output has always increased," or thought that "the increase in output is a manifestation of the increased awareness of the working class," did not deeply review it, and did not propose effective measures. Still busy with "numbers," "selling coal," "accounts," "expenses," and did not care about the production situation, so the phenomenon of destroying engineering still existed seriously until before the disaster. This is one of the important reasons for the disaster.

(2) Neglecting safety, the work has no focus. Leading cadres at all levels of the mine did not pay attention to safety at all. They did not use the previous disasters in the mine before liberation (from 1946 to 1948, there were four explosions, large and small, killing and injuring 112 workers) as a warning to educate employees. They did not promptly convey and implement the "safe production" policy clearly stipulated by the National Coal Mine Conference in December of last year. Knowing that the project was damaged and the methane gas was very large, they never paid attention to it. For example, a few days before the disaster, more than 20 workers almost suffocated to death due to roof collapse, but they were still not alert. The mine engineers shouted about ventilation, but the safety lamp was always put aside and never used. The chairman of the trade union misunderstood "security" as "public security." The production minister of the trade union mistakenly believed that the inspection at the mine entrance was an insult to the workers. The feudal foremen and some backward workers opposed progressive mining and support methods, but the leadership took a laissez-faire attitude, forming a phenomenon of support structures collapsing as soon as they were built. The work of the company and the mine did not focus on production. In order to get money and cope with "errands," they had subjectively set ten production plans. Except for one drainage plan that was successful, the rest failed or were shelved. In the more than 30 meetings held by the mine's engineering section, management committee, and representative meeting, and the so-called "successful democratic movement" meeting, the issues of production engineering were not discussed and arranged. The workers reflected: "The management committee is an official meeting." The trade union also did not conduct safety production and labor discipline education for workers, unilaterally believing that the machine workers above ground were progressive, and the underground workers were all backward and complicated. The trade union organization was detached from production and the masses, conducted trade union work in isolation, blindly responded to administrative calls, and launched production competitions, sometimes acting on behalf of the administration. This kind of leadership that does not implement resolutions, does not care about the life safety of workers, and neglects production and fails to grasp the focus of work is also one of the important reasons for the disaster.

(3) The system is chaotic, and bureaucratic work style exists seriously. The leading cadres of the mine failed to reform the foreman system in a step-by-step and planned manner, and did not implement the policy of uniting and transforming old employees, which aggravated the phenomenon of disunity, irresponsibility, abandonment of labor discipline, and chaotic system. For example, mine engineers, coal engineers, and team leaders (the names of coal engineers and team leaders were changed from foremen) often did not go down the mine, no one supervised the work underground, no one seriously reviewed the reports, people could enter and exit the mine entrance at will, no one was responsible, and no one cared about the destruction of engineering underground. Serious mistakes occurred in the "democratic movement" and "production competition" launched in November, allowing the development of unorganized democratic thought, contributing to the bad consequences of no one being responsible, losing leadership, and destroying engineering. For these serious situations, the administrative and trade union leaders have always believed that "the democratic movement has made great achievements, and all problems are gone," and never went deep to understand. What is particularly serious is that from the chief of the engineering section, the chairman of the trade union, the head of the welfare agency, down to the team leader and the material manager, they could all detain workers at will without anyone asking. The longest detention was 20 days, and the shortest was two or three days. Finding a guarantor to release them was the only way to deal with it. According to preliminary statistics: 60 people were detained last year, and 33 people were detained from January to March this year. This extremely serious bureaucratic work style is also one of the important reasons for the disaster.

(4) Serious mistakes occurred in leading the democratic movement, resulting in disunity and detachment from the masses. Due to the unclear understanding of relying on the working class, the disconnection between the leadership and the working class, and the disunity between new and old cadres, there has always been a serious situation of mutual opposition and attack among the personnel of the mine. Manager Zhang Jingru unconditionally trusted the old personnel and relied on the feudal foremen to carry out production; another group of cadres, however, ignored the victory situation, overestimated the enemy's strength, exaggerated the dark side, and regarded the old employees as a feudal group and attacked them indiscriminately. This situation has been developing until the "democratic movement" in November last year, which was the highest stage. In this movement, the method of "struggle meeting" was adopted, dismissing or imprisoning the chief of the general affairs section, the chief of the accounting section, and the chief of the engineering section, and confiscating the manager's self-defense pistol. This created a sense of fear among the general staff, which contributed to the development of phenomena such as the agreement without concurrence between the new and old staff, no one being responsible, and the detachment of all levels; however, the real important problems and the foreman system were not asked or understood. On the contrary, the foremen were rewarded, some were selected as production models; some were selected as employee representatives and participated in the management committee; some joined the trade union and became members; some increased their wages. At the same time, workers' wages were issued through the foremen, and the leaders praised them for being capable, helping these people to make waves, threatening the leadership, and often demanding wage increases, so that some systems could not be implemented. This situation still existed even after the disaster. The consistent practice of the foremen was to arbitrarily oppress and exploit the workers, create right and wrong, and often make sectarianism, making the workers split apart. Some cadres believed that the complexity of the workers was the workers' fault. As a result, upright workers were not mobilized, activists were detached from the masses, and the leadership was seriously detached from the working class. This is the basic reason for this disaster and all the mistakes.

In addition, the failure of the provincial-level leading organs to check and solve the problems in a timely manner, and the conservativeness and ignorance of the company and mine managers were also factors that were inextricably linked to this explosion. These comrades only saw the "achievements" but not the shortcomings and mistakes, and even treated their work with the excuse of not understanding and with an attitude of not seeking progress. They did not seriously study production knowledge and continue to improve their technical level and strive to learn to manage enterprises. This is a lesson worthy of great attention.

(III) Responsibility Analysis and Punishment
1.  Wang Xiangqian, manager of Henan Xin Yu Coal Mine Company (Yiluo Coal Mine is one of the seven mines under the company), has a serious bureaucratic work style. Since taking office in May last year, he has directly led the work of Yiluo Coal Mine, blindly conducting production regardless of supply and demand, and never asked about the safety of miners and machines, and did not establish necessary safety systems. After participating in the National Coal Mine Conference, he did not pay attention to the resolution on safe production and delayed it for as long as 40 days without conveying and arranging it (it was conveyed one day before the disaster). He never asked about or understood the production engineering matters of the mine, and the old feudal foreman system was kept intact. It was also a mistake to decide that the workers' wages should be issued through the foremen, which aggravated the disadvantages of the foremen not going down the mine and oppressing and exploiting the workers. Blindly demanded to increase output, calling for production competitions, turning a blind eye to the "production competitions" that repeatedly damaged the project, and did not pay attention to and correct them. He had no understanding of the actual situation of Yiluo Coal Mine, such as the fact that the chief of the engineering section, the chairman of the trade union, and the foreman could detain workers at will (more than 100 workers were detained from last year to March this year). And there is a serious bureaucratic work style. He failed to implement the policy of uniting and transforming old personnel. There were serious mistakes in leading the democratic movement in Yiluo Coal Mine. He took an attitude of distrust and attack towards Zhang Jingru, the manager of Yiluo Coal Mine, which resulted in chaotic system, disunity between new and old cadres, and no one being responsible for the work. Therefore, Wang Xiangqian should bear the main responsibility for this disaster in leadership and actual work, and should be dismissed and sent to the judicial organs for punishment according to law.

2.  Shi Xinlin, chief of the engineering section and mine engineer of Yiluo Coal Mine, abandoned his responsibilities, did not plan or arrange the work, and did not often go down the mine to inspect the work. He knew that destroying the project was wrong, but he did not stop it, holding an extremely irresponsible attitude. He usually did not pay attention to safety and did not establish a mine entrance inspection system. In mid-February, after receiving a phone call from Liang Boju, an engineer of Xin Yu Coal Mine Company, regarding paying attention to security, he did not pay attention to it and did not implement it. He had a safety lamp but did not use it, violating scientific principles. And he often illegally detained workers. Therefore, Shi Xinlin should bear the main responsibility for the disaster engineering, and should be dismissed and sent to the judicial organs for punishment according to law.

3.  Mao Decai, the coal engineer of Yiluo Coal Mine, was the coal engineer of the class that died in the disaster and was a former foreman. He abandoned his duties and did not lead the work underground. During the "production competition" in December last year, in order to gain merit and benefit, he led the workers to collectively steal coal underground, causing serious destructive consequences such as roof collapse, spalling, and collapse of support structures. And he once deceived his superiors and attempted to steal more than 3,000 jin of public food. Therefore, Mao Decai should bear the main responsibility for the disaster engineering and should be expelled and sent to the judicial organs for severe punishment according to law.

4.  Zhang Jingru, manager of Yiluo Coal Mine, has achieved results in the work of restoring production since taking over the mine in September 1948. Due to his strong conservative thinking, he unconditionally trusted the old personnel and relied on the feudal foremen to carry out production, and did not carry out any reforms in management and system. He was dissatisfied with the job transfer in May last year, and after being attacked in the democratic movement in November last year, he became even more negative in his work. On certain issues, he took "a wait-and-see attitude." He did not ask about the phenomenon of destroying the project, nor did he put forward any active opinions to try to stop it. And he once falsely made a production plan, deceiving his superiors, and attempted to receive more funds. Zhang Jingru's lack of a sense of ownership in his work attitude and abandonment of the responsibilities of the manager should bear the important responsibility for the leadership of the disaster and should be dismissed.

5.  An Shiheng, the mine engineer of Yiluo Coal Mine, abandoned the responsibilities of the mine engineer and did not often go down the mine to arrange production engineering work. He found that the project was being destroyed, but he neither reported to the superiors nor stopped it, taking a laissez-faire attitude. He expressed dissatisfaction with being assigned to work as the director of the well affairs section, and has been procrastinating from taking office (from the time the administration announced An as the director of the well affairs section on January 13th until shortly before the incident, he was only preparing to accept the position). He was very paralyzed when he went down the mine to inspect two hours before the disaster, and he did not find any signs of methane gas explosion (the actual temperature was already very high). Afterwards, he still failed to seriously review and still said that the airflow in the mine was normal, attempting to shirk responsibility. Therefore, An Shiheng should bear the important responsibility for the disaster engineering and should be dismissed immediately.

6.  Zhang Baoshan, the deputy chief of the engineering section of Yiluo Coal Mine, was a former foreman and could not be competent for the job. After being appointed to this position administratively, he did not actually take on the responsibilities of the deputy chief. He did not actively stop the phenomenon of destroying the project. He went down the mine with An Shiheng at the same time two hours before the incident, and he did not pay attention to the signs of methane gas explosion. Afterwards, he still could not seriously review and still said that the airflow in the mine was normal, attempting to shirk responsibility. Therefore, Zhang Baoshan should bear the secondary responsibility for the disaster engineering and should be dismissed.

7.  Liang Boju, an engineer of Xin Yu Coal Mine Company, was busy with the daily affairs assigned by the leaders and did not seriously ask about the engineering matters, abandoning his responsibilities. After participating in the National Coal Mine Conference, he did not pay enough attention to the "safe production" resolution that should be conveyed at the meeting. He only simply notified Shi Xinlin, the chief of the engineering section of Yiluo Coal Mine, on the phone that he should pay attention to security work, and then left it at that. Liang Boju should bear considerable responsibility for the disaster engineering and should be demoted.

8.  Huo Tianmin, the former deputy manager of Yiluo Coal Mine and current director of the business section of Xin Yu Coal Mine Company (transferred from Yiluo Coal Mine to Xin Yu Coal Mine Company in December last year), blindly approved unreasonable production quotas when he was the deputy manager and blindly rewarded the "production competition" that destroyed the project. Wrongly treated Manager Zhang Jingru and unreasonably confiscated his self-defense pistol. He should bear the direct responsibility for the disunity between the managers at that time, contributing to the bad consequences of disunity and no one being responsible in the mine afterwards. He should be given a major demerit.

9.  Liu Xiaoguang, Xu Sheng, and Feng Wu, the coal engineers and team leaders of Yiluo Coal Mine, were all former foremen. They abandoned their duties, did not lead the work underground, and intentionally encouraged workers to steal coal and destroy the project. They should all be expelled and investigated.

10. Ge Jiwu, deputy director of the Henan Provincial Industrial Guidance Committee, improperly appointed the main cadres of Xin Yu Coal Mine Company and Yiluo Coal Mine. He failed to clearly implement the policy of uniting and transforming old employees, so that the phenomenon of disunity among the cadres of the mine was never resolved. Although problems were found in Yiluo Coal Mine, he failed to check them in time and solve them appropriately. He did not deeply study the wrong experience in the "democratic movement" in Yiluo Coal Mine and promoted it blindly. He has deeply and painfully examined himself after the disaster and has requested punishment himself. He should be given a major demerit.

11. Wu Zhipu, chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, and Niu Peicong, vice chairman, failed to closely lead the industrial and mining business and improperly appointed cadres. Although they knew about the problems existing in Yiluo Coal Mine in the past, they failed to pursue them in depth and solve them in time. After the disaster occurred, they led their subordinates to work hard to deal with the aftermath and were extremely deeply and painfully examined themselves and have requested punishment themselves. Wu and Niu should both be given a warning.

12. Zhu Yi, minister of the Heavy Industry Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee, has requested punishment himself. It was found that the department was established not long ago, and only half a month had passed from the time it received the notice to take over the mine to the time the disaster occurred. It was actually impossible to send people to take over in time. He is not responsible for this incident and should be exempted from discussion.

13. Li Huimin, director of the preparatory committee of the Xin Yu Coal Mine Trade Union, made serious mistakes in leading the democratic movement in Yiluo Coal Mine, aggravating the phenomenon of disunity between new and old cadres and no one being responsible for the work. He did not understand the actual situation of Yiluo Coal Mine and blindly launched a production competition, causing the bad consequences of destroying the project. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions should be informed by letter to dismiss him.

14. Sun Jixian, chairman of the Yiluo Coal Mine Trade Union, did not actively conduct political education, production education, and labor discipline education for the workers. He acted on behalf of administrative work. He illegally detained workers and blindly implemented the instructions of the "production competition," causing the bad consequences of seriously destroying the project. Sun has deeply reviewed himself in this review and should be dealt with leniently. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions should be requested by letter to dismiss him.

15. Wang Zhihao, deputy director of the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, went to Yiluo Coal Mine in November last year to inspect the work, but he did not understand the basic situation of the mine. Instead, he blindly promoted the wrong experience in the "democratic movement" in Yiluo Coal Mine, contributing to the errors of the mine and causing losses in the work. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions should be requested by letter to give Wang Zhihao a major demerit for this serious bureaucratic work style.

(IV) Several Opinions on Future Industrial and Mining Safety Work
1. First of all, the erroneous viewpoints of "going down the mine is a disaster" and "to produce coal is inevitable to die" existing in the thinking of leading cadres, as well as the negative attitude of some engineering personnel who believe that it is impossible to do a good job of security work without perfect equipment. In addition, the leading cadres of general industrial and mining enterprises also have the following shortcomings in their thinking and work: some simply pursue the quantity of production and ignore the safety of workers' lives and state property; some do not reform the old system for a long time, rely on the feudal foremen instead of relying on the workers to implement democratic management, and are indifferent to the security education and worker welfare of the workers. In terms of engineering and technical personnel, they do not seek to improve the engineering design that violates scientific principles, and often show a perfunctory and irresponsible attitude. Therefore, we require: competent departments at all levels, enterprise managers, technical personnel, and all employees must conduct a serious struggle against this erroneous thinking and attitude.

2. Rapidly establish security organizations and systems. First, a security responsibility system must be established. Leading cadres and engineering personnel at all levels of factories and mines should be naturally responsible for all accidents. In terms of responsibilities, they should not only complete the state's production tasks but also complete security tasks, otherwise, they should be condemned by the state. This year, factory and mine management departments must quickly formulate security regulations, technical operating procedures, and security reward and punishment methods to clarify the responsibilities of employees and pay attention to safe production. Second, establish technical security supervision organizations to conduct top-down supervision and inspection of industrial and mining security work. At the same time, establish mass safety supervision organizations in each factory and mine to mobilize the masses to conduct bottom-up supervision and assist in the implementation of security work. Third, at present, all factories and mines should organize an emergency safety inspection, and the relevant central departments should quickly formulate inspection regulations and establish a regular inspection system.

3. Improve equipment and mining methods. The old residual pillar method of coal mining followed by various coal mines not only causes continuous accidents of spalling, roof collapse, and handling but also poor ventilation, which can easily cause methane gas explosions, and should be improved according to Soviet experience. Most of the accidents in various factories and mines are related to poor safety equipment and must be improved as much as possible. According to statistics for the first quarter of this year, a total of 326 workers died in coal mines across the country, and methane gas explosions accounted for 59.1 percent of the causes of accidents. Each mine must especially increase ventilation capacity to reduce methane gas hazards. Secondly, military, chemical, iron and steel, and other industries are also prone to accidents, causing major deaths, injuries, and property losses, and special attention must also be paid to the equipment for safety and hygiene.

4. The equipment of mines operated by provincial, cooperative, government, and military units and private mines is generally worse, and the management is even worse. In particular, most private mines only know how to make profits and ignore the safety of workers' lives. In most mining areas, small kilns stand in great numbers, and they are opened everywhere, which not only wastes national resources but also easily causes accidents and endangers the safety of large mines. Therefore, the people's governments of major administrative regions or provinces and cities should conduct strict inspections and supervision on the security issues of the above-mentioned mines and prevent the bad phenomena of random mining and harm to safety. The recent practice of Chahar Province in conducting a general survey of public and private mines in the province is very good. It is hoped that various provinces can also organize the strength of governments at all levels to conduct a general survey of the security work of public and private mines in the near future.

　　监察委员会处理宜洛煤矿爆炸事件
    分别予新豫煤矿公司经理等以撤职法办及降级记过等处分
    号召各工矿纠正错误思想迅速加强保安措施
    【新华社讯】政务院人民监察委员会处理河南新豫煤矿公司宜洛煤矿“二、二七”沼气爆炸灾变事件通报，全文如下：
  （一）灾变损失及善后情形
    河南公营新豫煤矿公司宜洛煤矿，位于洛阳西南七十华里。该矿煤质良好，蕴藏量估计为二亿二千万吨，煤层厚达二十余公尺。一九四八年河南全部解放，豫西行署于九月派张镜如为经理前往接收，十月三日正式开工，次年一月一日开始产煤。
    本年二月二十七日十八时四十五分，该矿发生井下沼气爆炸灾变。被炸面积一○六○○平方公尺，占井下全部面积三分之一以上。最后统计：工人死亡一百七十四名（内伤重而死者十二人），残废二人，轻伤二十四人（现已痊愈）。损失约计减产四千吨（以日产一百吨停工四十天计算）；加埋葬、抚恤、抢修工程等费共折麦子一百八十余万斤。灾变发生后，该矿成立善后委员会，发动员工积极抢救；洛阳专署、宜阳县府及当地驻军独十一团，均派医生赶往救治，伤者就地治疗，死者成殓埋葬，并抚恤难属，慰问伤员。河南省人民政府、河南省工会、中南军政委员会重工业部、中央燃料工业部、劳动部、全国总工会、全国煤矿工会筹委会、中央人民监察委员会等机关均曾派员先后赴该矿慰问，并协助抢修工程与善后工作。
  （二）灾变原因
    （甲）直接原因：该矿煤层，内含大量沼气。因系土法开采，自然通风，其工程多不合规格。每届春夏及夏秋季之交，风压时达平衡，风流不畅，沼气存积，遇有明火，即起爆炸。加以该矿历次灾变与解放前遭蒋匪严重破坏，工程设备破落不堪。在这种不利的客观条件下，而该矿工人平日井下吸烟，习为常事。根据检查，大致确定，这次灾变的直接原因，即为工人在井下划火吸烟引起爆炸。
    （乙）工作上的错误：这次灾变，不是偶然的，而是由于该矿没有执行全国煤矿会议所确定的“安全生产”的方针，依靠工人阶级的思想不明确，以及犯有严重的官僚主义作风所造成的。追究其原因：
    （１）领导思想具有单纯营业观点，盲目追求生产数字。去年“五一”劳动节，宜阳县府曾派人赴该矿发动“生产竞赛”，日产量最高竟达三○二吨（实际日产能力百吨左右，其余都是破坏工程偷出来的），造成冒顶、片帮、棚架倒塌，高车损坏等严重现象。该矿对此不仅未予注意，又于“七一”与十一月先后盲目掀起“选模运动”与“生产竞赛运动”。去年十一月，曾盲目规定超额奖励标准，竞赛了三天，工程破坏极重，劳动纪律也根本废弛。该矿领导干部，未有警觉，不加过问，或认为“产量总是提高了”，或以为“产量提高是工人阶级觉悟提高的表现”，并未深刻检讨，提出有效办法，仍然忙于“数字”、“卖煤”、“账目”、“开支”等而不过问生产情况，因而直至灾变前破坏工程的现象仍然严重存在。这是造成灾变的重要原因之一。
    （２）忽视安全，工作无重心。该矿各级领导干部，对安全毫不重视，对该矿解放前历次灾变（自一九四六年至一九四八年，曾发生大小爆炸四次，共伤亡工人一一二人），既未引以为戒，教育职工；对去年十二月全国煤矿会议明确规定的“安全生产”方针，亦未及早传达布置执行。明知工程破坏，沼气甚大，亦从未提起注意。例如灾变前几天，因冒顶堵塞，二十余工人几乎窒息而死，仍不警觉。矿师们空喊通风，但有安全灯而始终搁置未用。工会主任误解“保安”为“公安”。工会生产部长误认为井口检查是侮辱工人。封建把头和部分落后工人，反对进步的开采和搭棚方法，而领导上却采取听任的态度，形成棚架随搭随塌的现象。公司与矿上的工作没有以生产为重心，为了要钱与应付“差事”，曾经主观地订过十个生产计划，除了一个排水计划成功外，其余均告失败，或束之高阁。在该矿工务课、管委会、代表会举行的三十余次会议上和所谓“成功的民主运动”会上，未进行讨论和布置生产工程问题。工人反映：“管委会是官会”。工会也没有对工人进行安全生产及劳动纪律的教育，片面的认为井上机务工人进步，井下工人一概落后、复杂。工会组织既脱离生产，也脱离群众，孤立的进行工会工作，盲目响应行政号召，发动生产竞赛，有时包办代替行政。这种不执行决议，毫不关心工人生命安全和忽视生产，未能抓住工作重心的领导，亦为灾变的重要原因之一。
    （３）制度混乱，官僚主义作风严重存在。该矿领导干部对于把头制度未能有步骤有计划地进行改革，又不执行团结改造旧职员的方针，加重了不团结、不负责、劳动纪律废弛和制度混乱的现象。例如矿师、煤师、大组长（煤师大组长均系把头的改名），经常不下井，井下工作无人督促，表报无人认真审核，井口可以随便出入，无人负责，井下破坏工程，无人过问。在十一月展开的“民主运动”和“生产竞赛”中发生严重错误，放任了漫无纪律的民主思想发展，助长了以后无人负责，失却领导和破坏工程的恶果发生。对于这些严重的情况，行政和工会的领导人反一直认为“民主运动大有成绩，一切问题都没有了”，再也不去深入了解。特别严重的是上自工务课长、工会主任、福利社长，下至大组长、管料员。都可随便扣押工人，无人过问，多则二十天，少则二、三天，找保释放是惟一处理办法。据初步统计：去年共押六十余人，今年一月至三月共押三十三人。这种极端严重的官僚主义作风，也是造成灾变的重要原因之一。
    （４）在领导民主运动中发生严重错误，造成了不团结、脱离群众的恶果。由于依靠工人阶级的思想不明确，领导与工人阶级脱节和新老干部不团结等原因，该矿人员间一直严重存在着相互对立与攻击的状况。经理张镜如，无条件信任旧人员和依赖封建把头进行生产；另一部分干部，却忽视胜利局面，过高估计敌人力量，夸大黑暗的一面，把旧职员看成封建集团，不加区别的予以打击。这种状况一直发展到去年十一月“民主运动”时，为最高阶段。在这一运动中，曾采取了“斗争会”的方式，把总务课长、会计课长、工务课长等撤职或禁闭，并把经理的自卫手枪也没收了。这就造成一般人员的恐惧情绪，助长了新旧人员间貌合神离，无人负责，各级脱节等现象的发展；但对真正重要的问题和把头制度却没有过问和了解。相反的，把头们反而受到了奖励，有的被选为生产模范；有的被选为职工代表，参加了管委会；有的参加工会，当了委员；有的提高了工资。同时工人工资又经过把头们发给，领导上还口口声声称赞他们能干，更帮助了这些人的兴风作浪，威胁领导，经常要求增加工资，使有些制度不能执行。这种情形即在灾变后仍有。至随意压迫剥削工人，制造是非，常闹宗派，把工人闹得四分五裂，更是把头们的一贯作风。而有些干部却认为工人复杂是工人的过失。结果造成了正派工人没有发动起来，积极分子脱离群众，领导与工人阶级严重脱节的现象。这是造成这次灾变和一切过失的基本原因。
    此外，省级领导机关未能及时地检查与解决问题，以及公司和矿上的管理人员的守旧与无知。工程人员的技术水平不高与经验不足，也是与这一爆炸事件不无关系的一个因素。这些同志们，只看见“成绩”的一面，而看不见缺点和错误，甚至以不懂为借口，以不求进步的态度，来对待工作。他们没有认真的去学习生产知识和继续提高技术水平，努力学会管理企业。这是值得十分重视的经验教训。
  （三）责任分析与处分
    一、河南新豫煤矿公司（宜洛煤矿系该公司所辖七矿之一）经理王象乾存在着严重的官僚主义作风。自去年五月到任以来，即直接领导宜洛煤矿工作，不按供求情况，盲目进行生产，尤其对矿工及机器之安全从不过问，没有建立必要的安全制度。参加全国煤矿会议后，对安全生产的决议不加重视，竟拖延四十天之久，不作传达布置（灾变前一日才作传达）。对该矿生产工程事项从未过问和了解，对旧有的封建把头制度，原封未动。更错误的决定工人工资经过把头发给，加重了把头不下井和压迫剥削工人的弊病。盲目要求提高产量，号召生产竞赛，对屡次破坏工程的“生产竞赛”熟视无睹，未予注意与纠正。对宜洛煤矿的实际情况，如工务课长、工会主任、大小把头均可随意扣押工人（由去年至今年三月扣押工人百人以上）等情况毫无了解。并存在着严重的官僚主义作风。对团结改造旧人员的方针，未予执行。在领导宜洛煤矿民主运动中，有严重的错误。对宜洛煤矿经理张镜如等采取不信任与打击的态度，其结果造成了制度紊乱与新老干部不团结和工作上无人负责的现象。因此，王象乾在领导上与实际工作上应负这次灾变的主要责任，应予撤职，送司法机关依法惩办。
    二、宜洛煤矿工务课长兼矿师石新林放弃自己责任，对工作无计划无布置，平时不经常下井检查工作。对破坏工程明知不对，而不加制止，抱着极端不负责任的态度。平时不注意安全，未建立井口检查制度。二月中旬接到新豫煤矿公司工程师梁伯举关于注意保安的电话后，不予重视，更未执行。有安全灯而不用，违反科学原则。并经常非法扣押工人。因此，石新林应负灾变工程上的主要责任，应予撤职，送司法机关依法惩办。
    三、宜洛煤矿煤师毛得才，为灾变工人死难班的煤师，系过去大把头。平日放弃职责，不在井下领导工作。去年十二月“生产竞赛”时，为了邀功得利，领导工人在井下集体偷煤，造成冒顶、片帮、棚架倒塌的严重破坏恶果。并曾欺上瞒下，企图窃取公家粮食三千余斤。因此，毛得才应负灾变工程上主要责任，应予开除，送司法机关依法严惩。
    四、宜洛煤矿经理张镜如，自一九四八年九月接收该矿后，在负责恢复生产工作中，尚有成绩。由于浓厚的守旧思想，无条件的信赖旧人员和依靠封建把头进行生产，在管理上和制度上未进行任何改革。对去年五月调动工作不满，又在去年十一月民主运动中受到打击后，工作更加消极。在某些问题上，抱着“看笑话的态度”。对破坏工程现象不加过问，亦未提出积极意见设法制止。并曾虚造生产计划，欺瞒上级，企图多领资金。张镜如这种缺乏主人翁思想的工作态度与放弃经理职责，应负灾变领导上重要责任，应予撤职。
    五、宜洛煤矿矿师安士恒，放弃矿师职责，不常下井布置生产工程工作。发现破坏工程情事，既不向上级报告，亦不加制止，采取自由主义态度。对分配其担任井务股主任工作，表示不满，一直延不就职（自一月十三日行政上宣布安为井务股主任起至事变前不久才准备接受）。灾变前二小时下井检查，十分麻痹，竟未发现沼气爆炸征候（实际温度已经很高），事后还未能认真检讨，仍说井内风流正常，企图推却责任。因此，安士恒应负灾变工程上的重要责任，应即撤职。
    六、宜洛煤矿工务课副课长张宝山，系过去把头，本不能胜任职务。行政上任命此职后，实际未负起副课长职责。对破坏工程现象，未积极制止，事变前两小时与安士恒同时下井，亦未注意沼气爆炸征候。事后仍不能认真检讨，还说井内风流正常，企图推却责任。因此，张宝山应负灾变工程上的次要责任，应予撤职。
    七、新豫煤矿公司工程师梁伯举，平日忙于领导上所分配的日常事务工作，未认真过问工程事项，放弃自己职责。参加全国煤矿会议后，对会议中应予传达的“安全生产”的决议，重视不够，仅在电话上简单通知宜洛煤矿工务课长石新林，应注意保安工作，即为了事。梁伯举应负灾变工程上相当责任，予以降级处分。
    八、前宜洛煤矿副经理现任新豫煤矿公司经营课长霍天民（去年十二月由宜洛煤矿调赴新豫煤矿公司），在任副经理职务时，盲目的批准不合理的生产定额，盲目奖励破坏工程的“生产竞赛”，错误的对待经理张镜如，无理收缴其自卫手枪。应负当时经理间不团结的直接责任，助长了该矿以后不团结、无人负责的恶果。应记大过一次。
    九、宜洛煤矿煤师刘小光、徐升、大组长冯五，均系过去大把头，平日放弃职责，不在井下领导工作，并有意助长工人偷煤破坏工程。均着予开除，究办。
    十、河南省工业指导委员会副主任葛季武，对新豫煤矿公司与宜洛煤矿之主要干部，任用不当。执行团结改造旧职员方针不明确，致使该矿干部间不团结的现象始终未得到解决。对于宜洛煤矿虽发现问题而未能及时检查，加以适当解决。对宜洛煤矿“民主运动中”的错误经验，未深入研究，即予推广，灾变后自我检讨，深刻沉痛，曾自请处分，应记大过一次。
    十一、河南省人民政府主席吴芝圃、副主席牛佩琮，对工矿业务未能抓紧领导，任用干部不当，过去对宜洛煤矿存在的问题虽有所知，但未能深入追究，及时解决。灾变发生后，领导下级，处理善后甚力，自我检讨亦极深刻沉痛，曾自请处分。吴、牛二人均予以警告处分。
    十二、中南军政委员会重工业部部长朱毅，自请处分。查该部成立未久，奉到接管该矿通知至灾变发生，为时仅半月，事实上不可能及时派人前往接管。对此次事件并无责任，应予免议。
    十三、新豫煤矿工会筹备委员会主任李惠民，在领导宜洛煤矿民主运动中有严重错误，加重了新老干部不团结和工作上无人负责的现象，不了解宜洛煤矿的实际情况，盲目的发动生产竞赛，造成破坏工程的恶果。应函知全国总工会，予以撤职处分。
    十四、宜洛煤矿工会主任孙即显，对工人未积极的进行政治教育、生产教育及劳动纪律教育。包办行政工作。非法扣押工人，盲目执行“生产竞赛”的指示，造成严重破坏工程的恶果。孙在这次检讨中甚为深刻，应从轻处理，函请全国总工会，予以撤职处分。
    十五、河南省工会筹委会副主任王志浩，曾于去年十一月赴宜洛煤矿检查工作，但并未了解该矿基本情况，反将宜洛煤矿“民主运动”中的错误经验盲目推广，助长了该矿的错误，造成工作上的损失。王志浩此种严重的官僚主义作风，函请全国总工会，予以记大过一次的处分。
  （四）对今后工矿保安工作的几点意见
    一、首先，在领导干部思想上存在着的“下井三分灾”、“要出煤就不免死亡”的错误观点，以及某些工程人员认为没有完善设备就不可能做好保安工作的消极态度。此外，一般工矿企业的领导干部，思想上及工作上还存在着如下的缺点：有的单纯追求生产数量，忽视工人生命与国家财产的安全；有的对旧制度长期不加改造，依靠封建把头而不依靠工人实行民主管理，对工人进行保安教育与工人福利更是漠不关心。在工程技术人员方面，对违反科学原则的工程设计不求改进，经常表现着敷衍塞责，因袭旧规，不负责任的态度。因此，我们要求：各级主管部门、企业管理人员、技术人员与全体职工，必须针对此种错误思想与态度，进行严肃的斗争。
    二、迅速建立保安组织与制度。第一、必须建立保安责任制。各级工矿领导干部与工程人员，均应为一切责任事故的当然责任者。在职责上，不仅应完成国家的生产任务，亦须完成保安任务，否则即应受到国家的谴责。工矿管理部门，今年必须迅速制定保安规程、技术操作规程及保安奖惩办法，使员工职责明确，注意安全生产。第二、建立技术保安监察组织，对工矿保安工作，进行自上而下的监督与检查。同时在各工矿建立群众性的安全监督组织，发动群众自下而上的监督与协助保安工作的进行。第三、目前各工矿应组织紧急的安全大检查，中央有关部门应迅速制订检查条例，建立定期检查制度。
    三、改善设备与采矿方法。各煤矿因袭旧的残柱法采煤，不仅片帮、冒顶、搬运事故不断发生，且通风不良，亦易引起沼气爆炸，应根据苏联经验加以改进。各工矿大部事故之发生，均与保安设备不良有关，必须尽可能加以改善。根据本年第一季统计，全国煤矿共死亡工人三二六人，事故原因沼气爆炸占百分之五九点一，各矿须特别加通风能力，减少沼气为害。其次军工、化学、钢铁等工业，亦易发生事故，造成重大死伤与资财损失，亦须特别注意安全卫生之设备。
    四、省营、合作社、机关、部队经营与私营之矿山，一般的设备更差，管理更为不善。特别是私营矿山，大多只知赢利，忽视工人生命安全。多数矿区，小窑林立，到处乱开，不仅浪费国家资源，而且易生事故，危害大矿安全。因此，各大行政区或各省市人民政府，应对上述矿山的保安问题，进行严格检查、监督并防止胡乱开采与妨害安全的不良现象。最近察哈尔省对全省公私矿山进行普查的作法很好，希望各省最近亦能组织各级政府力量，对公私矿山之保安工作，进行一次普查。
