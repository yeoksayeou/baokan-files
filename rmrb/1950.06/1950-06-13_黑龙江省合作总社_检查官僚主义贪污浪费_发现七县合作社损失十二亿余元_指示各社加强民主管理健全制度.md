【Qiqihar News】 Heilongjiang Daily News: In the work of cooperatives in some counties, districts, and villages of Heilongjiang Province, due to the bureaucracy of leading organs and leading cadres, there are shortcomings such as unclear responsibilities and unclear accounts, resulting in serious embezzlement and waste. According to inspections by the Heilongjiang Provincial Cooperative Headquarters in the Suihua and Hailun County Joint Cooperatives, and reports from the Baiquan, Gannan, and other five County Joint Cooperatives, losses in the seven counties due to embezzlement by some cooperative cadres, as well as theft, fire, and loss incidents, totaled 1,263,900,000 yuan (Northeast currency, same below), not including the losses of materials that have not been converted into cash. The most serious embezzlement occurred in the Hailun County Joint Cooperative, where seven people embezzled more than 56 million yuan. Zhang Pengwan, who was in charge of managing cash, embezzled 120,000 yuan of food expenses for the first time. The director discovered this but did not pursue it. He then embezzled another 7 million yuan, which also was not seriously addressed. Later, he was exposed for his corrupt lifestyle, and he absconded with 20 million yuan in cash. In the Qingshan Village Cooperative of the Seventh District of Gannan County, Li Mingda, a former "Xingnong Association Chief" during the puppet Manchukuo regime, served as an accountant. The superior cooperative and local Party and government cadres did not strengthen education and supervision, leading to him running off with 10 million yuan in cash. In the Zhongjia Village Cooperative of the Xingren District of Baiquan County, the accounts were chaotic, and the director and accountant embezzled 20 million yuan. Secondly, due to lax systems and unclear responsibilities, theft, fire, and loss incidents occurred from time to time in some cooperatives. For example, when the Provincial Cooperative Headquarters inspected the warehouse of the Hailun County Joint Cooperative in early May, it was found that the warehouse was not managed by a dedicated person, the doors were not locked, and the windows were not closed. All nine table looms were broken, and more than 200 iron boxes were rotten. Fourteen bags of sorghum rice had been stockpiled for three years and were rotten beyond edibility. Five bags of wheat were left in the courtyard to be blown by the wind and eaten by pigs. 1,500 jin of gun sand were rusted, and one-fifth of the 700 jin of iron wire had rotted, yet the masses could not buy any for repairing agricultural tools. In the Seventh Village Cooperative of the Jinhe Seventh District, no one was on duty at night, and a fire started in the stove hole, burning down the house and materials, causing a loss of 78.5 million yuan.

The reasons for the above phenomena are, on the one hand, that cooperatives have developed rapidly in the past year, the quality of cadres is still very low, they are not proficient in their work, some cadres have a poor ideological style and lack a mass perspective, and the connection between cooperatives and the broad masses of members is not very close. On the other hand, there is a considerable degree of bureaucracy in the leadership of the provincial and county cooperatives, and they do not regularly conduct work inspections in villages and cooperatives. Some counties, even when they discovered shortcomings, mostly adopted a lenient attitude, emphasizing objective difficulties, and even thinking that "a little embezzlement doesn't matter." At the same time, the provincial and county cooperatives have not established a system for managing cadres and educating cadres in service, nor have they established a system of criticism and rewards and punishments; the democratic management of village cooperatives is not sufficient, thus losing the supervision of the masses.

In order to overcome the above phenomena, the Heilongjiang Provincial Cooperative Headquarters issued an "Instruction on Launching a Struggle Against Bureaucracy and Embezzlement and Waste" to its subordinates on May 28. The instruction made self-criticism and instructed cooperative at all levels to establish and improve the responsibility system for business management. It requires leading cadres and all staff of the cooperative to first launch a mass ideological struggle against bureaucracy and embezzlement and waste. Mobilize all cooperative cadres to democratically inspect work, examine ideology, launch criticism and self-criticism, and investigate the responsibility for theft and fire, and severely punish embezzlers. Secondly, it is necessary to do a good job in inventorying materials and settling accounts. Thirdly, model cooperative workers should be commended, and a conference of model cooperative workers should be held by the end of June, with the county cooperative as the unit. Fourthly, it is necessary to do a good job in the responsibility system for business management, first of all, to do a good job in setting expenditure quotas and commodity reduction quotas, and to establish a personal responsibility system for warehouse management, sales, and transportation. Fifthly, it is necessary to do a good job in the regular management and education system for cadres. Strengthen the business, cultural, and political studies of cadres in service. County and district cooperatives should establish a regular examination system. Village cooperatives should do a good job in democratizing management and strengthen the role of the board of directors and the members' representative assembly.

When Heilongjiang Daily published the above news on May 28, it also published a short commentary, calling on cooperatives throughout the province to follow the instructions of the Provincial Cooperative Headquarters, take immediate action, promote democracy, solicit the opinions of the broad masses of members, mobilize the masses to supervise, and further improve the cooperatives.

    检查官僚主义贪污浪费
    发现七县合作社损失十二亿余元  指示各社加强民主管理健全制度
    【齐齐哈尔讯】黑龙江日报消息：黑龙江省部分县、区、村的合作社工作中，由于领导机关与领导干部的官僚主义，存在着责任不明、账目不清等缺点，产生了严重的贪污浪费现象。据黑龙江省合作总社赴绥化、海伦两县县联社的检查和拜泉、甘南等五县县联社的反映，七县中因部分合作社干部贪污以及偷盗、火灾、丢失等事件所引起的损失共达十二亿六千三百九十万元（东北券，下同），未折成现款的物资损失还不在内。贪污现象最严重的是海伦县联社，七个人贪污了五千六百多万元。管理现金的张鹏万第一次贪污伙食费十二万元，主任发觉后未加追究，第二次又贪污七百万元，也未认真处理。后来因其生活腐化被揭发出来，他竟带现款二千万元潜逃了。甘南县七区青山村合作社，由伪满“兴农会长”李明达当会计，上级合作社和当地党、政干部又未加紧教育、监督，以致使他拐跑了现款一万万元。拜泉县兴仁区众家村合作社，账目混乱，主任和会计贪污了二千万元。其次，部分合作社因制度不严，责任不清，以致偷盗、火灾、丢失事件不时发生。如省总社在五月初检查海伦县联社仓库时，发现仓库没有专人管理，门不锁、窗户不关，九台织布机都坏了，烂了二百多个铁盒子。有十四袋高粱米积压了三年，烂得不能吃了。有五袋小麦放在院里让风吹猪掏。有一千五百斤枪砂生了锈，七百多斤铁丝子烂了五分之一，而群众修理农具等着用都买不到。津河七区七村合作社，夜里无人值宿，炕洞着火，烧了房子物资，损失七千八百五十万元。
    产生上述现象的原因，一方面是一年来合作社发展快，干部质量还很低，业务不熟练，部分干部思想作风不良并缺乏群众观点，合作社与广大社员群众的联系还不很密切；另一方面，是省、县合作社领导上存在着相当严重的官僚主义，没有经常深入村社进行工作检查；有的县发现了缺点，也多采取迁就的态度，强调客观困难，甚至以为“贪污点算不了啥”。同时，省县社没有建立起干部管理和在职干部教育的工作制度，没有建立起批评与奖惩的制度；村社的民主管理做得不够，因而失去了群众的监督。
    黑龙江省合作总社为克服上述现象，于五月二十八日向所属发出了“开展反对官僚主义和贪污浪费的指示”。指示中作了自我批评，并责成各级合作社建立和健全业务管理的责任制。要求合作社领导干部和全体工作人员，首先开展群众性的反对官僚主义和贪污浪费的思想斗争。发动全体社干部民主检查工作，检查思想，展开批评与自我批评，并追查偷盗、火灾的责任，严惩贪污分子。其次，要做好清查物资和结清账目的工作。第三，要评奖合作社模范工作者，六月底以县社为单位召开合作社模范工作者会议。第四，要做好业务管理上的责任制，首先搞好开支定额和货物减量定额，建立仓库保管、卖货、运销等个人负责制。第五，要搞好经常的干部管理和教育制度。加强在职干部的业务、文化和政治学习。县区社要建立定期的考试制度。村社搞好管理民主化，加强理监事会和社员代表会的作用。
    黑龙江日报于五月二十八日发表上述新闻时，并发表了短评，号召该省各地合作社遵照省总社指示，马上行动起来，发扬民主，征求广大社员的意见，发动群众来监督，进一步把合作社搞好。
