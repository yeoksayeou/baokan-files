　　Important Correction
　　Yesterday, there were several significant errors in the text of Article 26 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as quoted in our newspaper's editorial, "How to Adjust Relations Between Public and Private Industry and Commerce": The phrase "rural-urban mutual assistance" was omitted after "labor-capital benefit"; "scope of business" was mistaken for "economic scope"; and "various social economic components" was mistaken for "each social economic component." There were also punctuation errors. The original text of Article 26 of the Common Program is hereby reprinted as follows for correction: "The fundamental policy of economic construction of the People's Republic of China is to achieve the goal of developing production and promoting economic prosperity through a policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and exchange between domestic and foreign entities. The state should adjust the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, the individual economy of farmers and handicraft workers, the private capitalist economy, and the state capitalist economy in terms of scope of business, raw material supply, sales markets, labor conditions, technical equipment, financial policies, and monetary policies, so that various social economic components can, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, divide their labor and cooperate, and each obtain their due, in order to promote the development of the entire social economy."

　　重要补正
    昨天本报社论《如何调整公私工商业关系》中所引用的中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第二十六条，文字上有几处重要错漏：“劳资两利”下遗漏“城乡互助”，“经营范围”误为“经济范围”，“各种社会经济成份”误为“每种社会经济成份”；标点亦有错误；应予更正。特重刊共同纲领第二十六条原文如下：“中华人民共和国经济建设的根本方针，是以公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的政策，达到发展生产、繁荣经济之目的。国家应在经营范围、原料供给、销售市场、劳动条件、技术设备、财政政策、金融政策等方面，调剂国营经济、合作社经济、农民和手工业者的个体经济、私人资本主义经济和国家资本主义经济，使各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展。”
