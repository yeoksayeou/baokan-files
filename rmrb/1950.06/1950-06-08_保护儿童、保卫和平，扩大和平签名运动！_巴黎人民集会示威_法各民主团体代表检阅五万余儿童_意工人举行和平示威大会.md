Xinhua News Agency, June 6th, TASS, Paris: On June 4th, a mass demonstration to protect children, defend peace, and sign the declaration for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons was held at the "Buffalo" Stadium in Paris. The stadium, which could originally accommodate about 25,000 people, was packed to capacity. Tens of thousands of Parisian citizens gathered outside the venue in the square in front of loudspeakers to listen to reports.

On the rostrum sat representatives of the French Women's Union, the French Republican Youth Union, the "Association of Fighters for Freedom and Peace," the Women's International Democratic Federation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and many other democratic groups. During the children's inspection, over 50,000 children marched past the rostrum for three hours. The children held various flags and banners with slogans such as: "We want to live! We want peace! We want bread! Mothers and fathers, please protect us from atomic bombs!", "We want to study, but our education funds are being taken away to pay for military expenses!"

After the inspection, Mrs. Gordon, representative of the Women's International Democratic Federation, gave a congratulatory speech to the children. Subsequently, the "Association of Fighters for Freedom and Peace" read out its appeal to the children.

In the square where the demonstration was held, a mother held a memorial statue of her dead child, with the inscription "This is War"!

    在主席台上坐着法兰西妇女联盟、法兰西共和青年联盟、“争自由和平战士协会”、国际民主妇联、国际民主青联、法共中央委员会以及其他许多民主团体的代表。当举行儿童检阅时，有五万余儿童走过主席台前，历时达三小时之久。儿童们手执各种旗帜标语，上面写着：“我们要生活！我们要和平！我们要面包！父亲母亲们，求你们保护我们，不受原子弹杀害！”，“我们要求学，可是，我们的教育经费被夺去充军费了！”
    检阅之后，国际民主妇联代表戈登夫人向儿童们致祝词。随后，就宣读了“争自由和平战士协会”对儿童的号召。
