    Ping Shan Yan Fort Village Cadres Punished for Embezzling Public Grain

    Cadres in Yan Fort Village, Pingshan County, Hebei Province, collectively embezzled and sold public property. The county government has severely punished them.

    During the summer grain collection in 1949, the village should have first completed the quota for that year and then cleared the arrears from 1948. However, the village cadres used the wheat collected that year to first clear the arrears. As a result, the masses were unable to pay the new levy, and the new levy could not be completed as required. To overcome the problem of arrears in grain collection every year, the county and district governments emphasized that the new levy must be completed. After their demands that the masses pay proved ineffective, Yu Xixiu (village chief), Qi Moxi (branch secretary), and Yu Laixiao (finance committee member) discussed drawing 13,838 catties of wheat from the already paid arrears to supplement the newly levied public grain.

    The 1948 arrears were calculated at one catty of millet per catty of wheat, while the summer levy last year was calculated at fourteen taels of wheat per catty of millet. Due to the different conversion rates, an excess of 1,729 catties and twelve taels of wheat was generated. Yu Xixiu and the other three secretly embezzled this grain. Besides the 13,838 catties of wheat used to supplement the new levy, more than 10,000 catties of wheat from the 1948 arrears were deposited in the local granary. The sub-granary director, Qi Linlin (from Yan Fort Village), seeing that other villages had not paid much in arrears, said to the village finance committee member, Yu Laixiao: "Our village has collected too much in arrears." So Yu Laixiao discussed it with Yu Xixiu and Qi Moxi, and they took out more than 4,000 catties of wheat that had already been stored as private shares for 18 people, including the village cadres, to invest in the village cooperative. In addition to dividing up the large shares, Yu Xixiu, Qi Moxi, and Yu Laixiao also took out 1,204 catties of wheat from the local granary and bought a flock of sheep. Disregarding the interests of the masses, they let the sheep graze on the people's wheat seedlings. Furthermore, Qi Moxi and others led the village militia squad to steal part of the lumber from the public houses on Jianjian Mountain in the village to make eighteen benches and five beds. They also stole and sold some of the public's odds and ends.

    According to the investigation, Yu Xixiu and others embezzled a total of 693,312 catties of wheat (some public property has not yet been ascertained). Among them, Yu Xixiu, Qi Moxi, Yu Laixiao, and Qi Linlin should bear the main responsibility for the case.

    In order to strictly comply with the financial system, ensure state revenue, overcome embezzlement and waste, and educate all cadres, the county people's government has sentenced Yu Xixiu and the other four to eight months in prison by the county people's court and recovered the embezzled and stolen money and goods that have now been ascertained.

### 平山烟堡村干部贪污公粮受处分

　　平山烟堡村干部贪污公粮受处分
    河北平山县一区烟堡村干部，集体贪污，窃卖公物。该县县政府已给予严厉处分。
    一九四九年夏征时，该村本应先完成当年分配数字，再清理一九四八年的尾欠。但该村干部却把当年征收的小麦，先顶清了尾欠。结果使群众无力缴纳新征，致新征不能如数完成。县、区政府为要克服过去年年征粮有尾欠的毛病，强调新征一定要完成任务。该村干部在要求群众缴纳无效后，便由于喜秀（村长）、齐墨喜（支书）、于来销（财政委员）等三人商议，再从已缴的尾欠项下提出小麦一万三千八百三十八斤补入新征的公粮。
    一九四八年的尾欠，是按小麦一斤折小米一斤计算的，而去年夏征则是小麦十四两折小米一斤。由于折合率不同，便长出了小麦一千七百二十九斤十二两。于喜秀等三人便将这笔粮食暗中贪污中饱了。一九四八年尾欠，除了小麦一万三千八百三十八斤挪补新征外，尚有一万余斤小麦入了地方粮库。该分库主任齐林林（烟堡村人），因见其他村庄尾欠数字补交不多，就对该村财政委员于来销说：“咱村征收尾欠太多了。”于是于来销与于喜秀、齐墨喜商量，将已经入库的麦子四千余斤取出，作为村干部等十八人私股投入村合作社。于喜秀、齐墨喜、于来销除分了巨股外，又从地方粮库内取出一千二百零四斤小麦，伙买了一群羊。并且不顾群众利益，让羊群到处吃老百姓的麦苗。此外，齐墨喜等又带领村民兵小队，盗窃该村尖尖山上的公房木料一部，作了十八条板凳，五个床铺；还窃卖公家的零星东西一部。
    据调查结果，于喜秀等前后共贪污小麦六十九万三千三百一十二斤（还有一部公物尚未查清）。其中于喜秀、齐墨喜、于来销及齐林林四人应负该案的主要责任。
    县人民政府为严格遵守财政制度，保障国家收入，克服贪污浪费及教育全体干部，已由县人民法院判处于喜秀等四人徒刑八个月，并追回现已查明之贪污及盗窃款物。
