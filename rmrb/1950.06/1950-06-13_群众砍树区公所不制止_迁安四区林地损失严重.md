　　Serious tree felling has occurred in villages such as Dawangdu Village, Xiaowangdu Village, Qianwozi, Houwozi, and Daguo Village in the Fourth District of Qian’an County, Hebei Province. According to investigations, over 3,000 trees have been cut down, covering an area of more than 60 mu. The situation is most serious in Qianwozi, where over 30 mu of woodland has been cleared. The reasons for this incident are: First, the people are facing economic hardship after the famine, and the district government has failed to effectively lead the masses to actively engage in production for self-relief. Second, district and village cadres have failed to promptly stop those who violate government decrees and sabotage production. For example, Wang Zeng (a party member) and Liu Shun of Qianwozi were caught stealing trees by Cao Zhengshan, the village militia captain, who tried to stop them. Not only did they refuse to listen, but they also verbally abused and physically assaulted Cao Zhengshan, chasing him away with an axe. Cao Zhengshan then reported to the district office. The district office only summoned Wang Zeng and Liu Shun for a brief criticism before sending them home, failing to effectively stop their illegal tree felling. Village cadres, believing that the district office could not make a decision, also ceased to intervene. After returning to the village, the tree cutters became even bolder, recklessly felling trees, and the trend of stealing trees expanded, causing significant losses to the people.
　　Now, the Qian’an County government has taken notice of this issue and dispatched the Director of the Public Security Bureau and two section chiefs from the county government to the district to assist the district government in conducting an investigation and handling the matter.

　　群众砍树区公所不制止  迁安四区林地损失严重
    河北省迁安县四区大望都庄、小望都庄、前窝子、后窝子、大郭庄等村，都发生了偷砍树木的严重现象。据调查：被砍树木已达三千余棵，面积有六十余亩。其中前窝子情况最为严重，三十余亩树林已被砍成空地。这一事件发生原因是：一、人民经过灾荒，生活困难；而区政府没有很好领导群众积极生产自救。二、区、村干部对违犯政府法令、破坏生产者，未能及时进行制止。如前窝子王增（党员）、刘顺两人偷砍树木，该村民兵中队长曹正山发觉后，即予制止。他俩不但不听，反而破口大骂，还打了曹正山，并用斧子将曹正山赶跑。曹正山便去报告区公所。区公所只将王增、刘顺叫去批评了一顿，即令其回家；没有有效地制止他们偷砍树木的违法行为。村干部认为区里不能作主，也就不管了。砍树者回村后，更放胆大肆砍伐，偷树风潮日益扩大，造成了人民的巨大损失。
    现在迁安县县政府已经注意了这个问题，派公安局长及县政府二个科长到该区协同区政府进行调查处理。
