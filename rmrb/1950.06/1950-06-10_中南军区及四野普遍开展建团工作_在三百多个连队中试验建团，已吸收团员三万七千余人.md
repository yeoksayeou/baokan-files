　　Central South Military Region and Fourth Field Army Universally Carry Out Youth League Building Work
    Trial Youth League Building Conducted in More Than 300 Companies, Absorbing More Than 37,000 Youth League Members
    [Report from this newspaper] The Central South Military Region and the various units of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army began to universally establish the work of the Youth League organizations in May. The Military Region's Communist Party Committee and the Fourth Field Army's Political Department jointly issued a decision on universally building the Youth League in the entire army. The Political Department of the Military Region also established a Youth Work Department (referred to as the Youth Department) to strengthen the leadership of youth work in the army. Prior to this, the various departments of the army had conducted large-scale trial youth league building work since October of last year. The various units focused on establishing Youth League organizations in more than 300 companies and other units, trained more than 3,000 youth work cadres and youth league building backbones, and the entire army (including the five provincial military regions under its jurisdiction) has developed 37,100 Youth League members. A vigorous new atmosphere has emerged in the troops where the Youth League has already been established.剿匪 Suppressing bandits in combat and production labor have become more active, learning has become more intensive, and life has become more active. There are songs everywhere in the company, and there are educational evenings every week. The thinking of commanders and fighters has also been improved a step further in the building of the Youth League, a large number of activists have emerged, and backward phenomena have been decreasing day by day.
    The youth league building work of various units is carried out under the policy of being open and bold, prepared, and step-by-step. Generally, it goes through three steps from top to bottom: The first is to prepare for youth league building: The work includes the Party committee's discussion, research, resolution, formulation of plans, mobilization of cadres, equipping and training youth work cadres above the company level, and through them, training and cultivating a group of company youth league building backbones by the regiment (or division) as a unit. The second step is to focus on pilot projects: that is, within a regiment or a division, select companies with more suitable conditions to conduct youth league building pilot work. Finally, summarize the experience of trial youth league building and promote it to the entire army for universal youth league building.
    The six-month experience of trial youth league building proves that youth league building in the company should first cooperate with the company's current tasks, carry out universal and in-depth education, systematically introduce the basic knowledge of the Youth League, and carry out in-depth education in light of the current ideological situation of the soldiers and the understanding of various people, establish the idea of ​​building a national defense army as a combat team, and mobilize everyone to strive to join the League with the performance of actual work. Youth League building propaganda mainly adopts methods such as large classes, lectures, discussion groups, individual talks, etc., and uses evening schools, entertainment evenings, blackboard newspapers, visits, and other occasions to carry out publicity. To set off a large-scale conscious and voluntary upsurge of applying to join the League, creating an atmosphere of universal seeking of progress in the company. Then, conduct key public discussions to educate League members and educate the masses. There must be preparation before the public discussion, and objects with more educational significance should be selected from the applicants for public discussion. The Party must conduct discussions in advance, and the masses must be mobilized first. And educate the applicants to prevent negative emotions when the application to join the League is not approved. When absorbing League members, one should carefully select according to the provisions of the League Constitution, but one should prevent various closed-door phenomena. The oath ceremony of joining the League should be held solemnly to expand the influence of the League among young people. After the establishment of the Youth League organization, it should closely unite the vast number of young people, actively carry out work to complete the various current tasks of the Party and the administration, and cooperate with the central task to carry out cultural learning, political learning, and entertainment activities to enrich the life of the League, strengthen the education of League members, cultivate grassroots cadres of the League, and continuously absorb advanced young people into the organization of the League.

　　中南军区及四野普遍开展建团工作
    在三百多个连队中试验建团，已吸收团员三万七千余人
    【本报讯】人民解放军中南军区及第四野战军各部队已于五月份开始普遍建立青年团组织的工作。军区中共党委与四野政治部联合发出了关于全军普遍建团的决定。军区政治部以下并成立了青年工作部（简称青年部），以加强部队青年工作的领导。在此以前，该军各部曾于去年十月起大规模地进行试验建团工作。各部队有重点地在三百多个连队和其他单位中建立了团的组织，训练了三千余名青年工作干部与建团骨干，全军（包括所属五个省军区）已发展团员三万七千一百余人。在已经建团的部队中，出现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。剿匪作战、生产劳动更积极了，学习也更紧张，生活活跃起来，连队中到处是歌声，每星期都有富有教育意义的晚会。指战员的思想也在建团中提高了一步，积极分子大批涌现，落后现象日益减少。
    各单位的建团工作是在公开大胆、有准备、有步骤的方针下进行的。一般都是自上而下地经过三个步骤：首先是准备建团：其工作包括党委讨论、研究、作决议、制订计划、动员干部、配备与训练连以上青年工作干部并通过他们以团（或以师）为单位训练与培养一批连队建团骨干。第二步是重点试办：即在一个团或一个师内，选择条件较适宜的连队，进行建团试验工作。最后，总结试验建团经验，推广到整个部队去进行普遍建团。
    六个月试验建团的经验证明，连队中建团首先应配合连队的当前任务，进行普遍深入的教育，有系统地介绍团的基本知识，并针对着战士们当前的思想情况与各种人的认识，进行深入的教育，树立建设国防军当一个战斗队的思想，并发动大家以实际工作的表现来争取入团。建团宣传主要是采取上大课、讲演会、座谈会、个别谈话等方式，并利用夜校、娱乐晚会、黑板报、参观访问等场合进行。以掀起大量的自觉自愿的申请入团热潮，造成连队普遍求进步的气氛。然后再进行重点公议，以教育团员、教育群众。公议之前必须有准备，应在申请者中选择较有教育意义的对象进行公议，党内要事先作讨论，群众中先作动员。并教育申请者，防止申请入团未被批准时产生消极情绪。在吸收团员时应根据团章的规定，慎重选择，但应防止各种关门现象。入团宣誓典礼应隆重举行，以扩大团在青年中的影响。建立团的组织后，应紧紧团结广大青年，为完成党与行政的各种当前任务积极展开工作，并配合中心任务开展文化学习、政治学习和娱乐活动，以充实团的生活，加强团员的教育，培养团的基层干部，并不断吸收先进青年到团的组织中来。
