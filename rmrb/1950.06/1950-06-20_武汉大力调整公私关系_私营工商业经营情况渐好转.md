　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 18th: Public-private industrial and commercial relations in Wuhan are being vigorously adjusted; private industrial and commercial enterprises beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are becoming increasingly active. Since mid-April, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, in accordance with the instructions of the Central People's Government and the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, has begun to adjust the public-private relations of industry and commerce in the city in a step-by-step manner. First, through the city's People's Representative Conference and various symposiums, it reviewed the past public-private relations, widely publicized policies, and enabled government cadres, workers, and private industrialists and merchants to correctly understand public-private relations and strengthen the relationship between them.

　　At the same time, various state-owned specialized companies have successively adjusted wholesale and retail prices based on retail costs and reasonable profit margins. The focus of their business has been shifted to operating wholesale and extensively uniting private businesses, vigorously developing rural markets, and appropriately reducing their operating scope in cities. As of now, except for some retail institutions retained to stabilize the retail prices of major materials such as grain, coal, and salt, excessive retail and consignment stores have been abolished. Commercial activities operated by government agencies, troops, cooperatives, etc., have also been stopped, and the stores they opened have been closed. In market management, the People's Government has abolished the purchase certificate and negotiated pricing system, as well as various restrictions on exchanges. In addition, there have been improvements in taxation and processing and ordering policies.

　　These measures have provided a broad scope of activity for legitimate private capital, and legitimate legal profits have been further guaranteed, which has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of private capital operation. In addition, with stable financial prices, private business activities have gradually become active since May. Judging from the changes in the proportion of public and private market transactions in April and May: In May, except for grain, salt, and cotton cloth, where state-owned companies maintained the same proportion of transactions as in April, the transaction volume of state-owned companies' cotton dropped from 41.75% of the total transaction volume in April to 10.3%; cotton yarn decreased from 88.30% to 78.91%; edible oil decreased from 40.78% to 5.24%. Conversely, the proportion of private merchants' transactions gradually increased. By early June, the purchase volume of major materials such as grain, cotton, cloth, salt, and oil by private merchants had increased to more than 95% of the total transaction volume. The quantity of the above-mentioned materials sold by state-owned companies from January to May this year accounted for an average of 70% to 80% of the total transaction volume, which has been reduced by an average of about 50% in early June. In the past few months, most of the funds of private merchants in the city's grain, coal, salt, oil, and other industries have been stagnant, relying on consignment sales for state-owned companies to maintain. At present, state-owned companies have cancelled consignment sales business, and many private merchants have taken out funds to purchase materials in the countryside. The operating conditions of the automobile and shipping industries have also greatly improved due to the active exchange of materials.

　　As a result of the improvement of public-private relations and the active exchange between urban and rural areas, state-owned companies have also made new developments in their business. Although the proportion of transactions by state-owned companies has decreased, the absolute number of transactions has greatly increased and prices have been stabilized at reasonable levels. In April, the sales volume of grain by state-owned companies was less than 150,000 jin. In May, the focus of business was placed on wholesale, retail sales were reduced, and the method of regular payment was adopted to vigorously unite private merchants to operate together. The total sales of grain in the whole month reached more than 6 million jin. In early June, the sales of rice alone reached more than 3.8 million jin. Due to the vigorous development of rural markets by state-owned companies, many rural merchants have entered the city to sell local products and transport daily necessities back, and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas has become more active.

　　武汉大力调整公私关系
    私营工商业经营情况渐好转
    【新华社汉口十八日电】武汉市公私工商业关系正在大力调整中；有利于国计民生的私营工商业已日见活跃。武汉市人民政府根据中央人民政府及中南军政委员会指示，自四月中旬以来，有步骤地开始调整该市工商业的公私关系。首先是通过该市各界人民代表会议及各种座谈会，检讨了已往的公私关系，广泛宣传政策，使政府工作干部、工人及私营工商业者正确了解公私关系，密切彼此之间的关系。
    与此同时，各国营专业公司相继根据零售成本及合理的利润比例，调整了批发和零售价格，其业务重点改为以经营批发及广泛团结私商为主，大力开辟农村市场，适当地缩小了在城市中的经营范围。截至目前止，除了为稳定粮、煤、盐等主要物资零售价格而保留的部分零售机构外，过多的零售、代销店等都已撤消。机关、部队、合作社等所经营的商业活动亦已停止，他们所开设的商店则已取消。在市场管理上，人民政府已废除了采购证和议价制度以及交易所的各种限制。此外，在税收及加工、订货政策方面，也都有了改进。
    这些措施给予正当私人资本提供了广阔的活动范围，正当的合法利润亦因之有了更大保证，而大大地鼓舞了私人资本经营的积极性。再加以金融物价平稳，自五月份以来，私营商业的活动已渐见活跃。以四、五两月市场成交量公私所占比重上的变化来看：五月份除在粮、盐、棉布方面，国营公司仍保持四月份的成交比重外，国营公司棉花成交量由四月份占总成交量的百分之四十一点七五，降到百分之十点三；棉纱由百分之八十八点三零，降到百分之七十八点九一；食油由百分之四十点七八，降到百分之五点二四；相反，私商成交比重则逐渐增加，至六月上旬，粮食、棉花、布匹、盐、油等主要物资，私商购进数量，均增加到总成交量的百分之九十五以上。而上述物资从今年一至五月由国营公司所售出数量，平均占总成交量百分之七十至八十以上，六月上旬都平均降低百分之五十左右。在过去数月中，全市粮食、煤、盐、油等业的私商大部资金都曾呆滞，依靠替国营公司代销维持。目前国营公司已撤销代销业务，许多私商已拿出资金下乡采购物资。汽车、轮船业的经营情况也都因物资交流活跃而大为好转。
    公私关系改进和城乡交流活跃的结果，国营公司业务也有新的发展。国营公司的成交比重虽已降低，但其成交数量的绝对数却大有增加并做到了稳定物价在合理的水平上。四月份国营公司粮食销出量不到十五万斤，五月份将业务重点放在批发，缩小零售，采用定期交款办法，大力团结私商共同经营，全月销出粮食竟达六百多万斤。六月上旬，仅大米一项就销出三百八十多万斤。由于国营公司大力开辟农村市场，许多农村商贩进城出售土产，又贩运日用必需品回去，城乡物资交流已因之更为活跃。
