(Guangzhou News) *Southern Daily* reports: Since the liberation of Guangzhou, workers at the Guangzhou Bridge Factory have successively completed the first and second phases of production, producing nearly ten thousand tons of steel beams for use in building main bridges in various locations.

The first phase of the task began on January 6th and was completed on February 13th. In order to complete the bridge assembly task, the workers diligently studied technology, and the work progress was extremely impressive. Taking rivet guns as an example, before liberation, each gun would drive one hundred rivets per day, but now it has rapidly increased to two hundred and fifty. Individual workers have even set a record of riveting six hundred. From February 11th to March 2nd, the factory produced a total of 7,769 tons of steel beams, and was rewarded by the Guangzhou Railway Bureau. The second phase of the task was also completed on time.

The third phase of the factory's task is inventory and organization. All employees, with high enthusiasm, in the first stage (April 22nd to May 15th), sorted out more than five thousand tons of steel beams and over a million screws, demonstrating the working class's high level of class consciousness and sense of responsibility.

　　广州桥梁厂工人造成钢梁近万吨
    【广州讯】南方日报消息：自广州解放后，广州桥梁厂工人先后完成了第一、二两期生产任务，造成近万吨钢梁，供给各地修建正桥使用。
    第一期任务自一月六日开始，二月十三日完成。工人们为了完成拼桥任务，努力学习技术，工作进度极为惊人。以持枪铆钉为例，解放前每枪每天打一百个，现则迅速增到二百五十个，个别工人曾创造了铆六百个的最高纪录。从二月十一日至三月二日间，该厂共造成七千七百六十九吨钢梁。受到广州铁路分局的奖励。第二期任务亦是按时完成。
    该厂第三期任务是清点整理工作。全体职工又以高度热情，在第一阶段（四月二十二日至五月十五日），整理了五千多吨钢梁与百万多个螺丝，表现了工人阶级高度的阶级觉悟和责任心。
