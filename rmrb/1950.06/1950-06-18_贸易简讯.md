    Zhengzhou Department Store Exceeds Currency Withdrawal Target
    In May, the Zhengzhou Department Store continued to implement the policy of stabilizing prices, withdrawing a total of 2.66 billion yuan in currency for the month, exceeding the original target of 2.4 billion yuan by 10.83%. The company will hold commendation and model worker evaluation meetings to encourage personnel who are actively responsible in their work. Those who are indifferent to their work will also be criticized.

    Furthermore, when market prices fell, the company promptly released a large amount of currency to purchase slow-moving commodities on the market. For example, from late April to May 27, the company released a total of over 1.4 billion yuan, gradually raising market prices to approach the company's listed prices.

    Suzhou Grain Branch Reverses Bureaucratic Style
    The Suzhou Branch of the China Grain Company vigorously improved its working methods in May, reversing the long-standing bureaucratic style of the past, enabling the monthly currency withdrawal target to exceed the original plan by 25.12%.

    Tianjin North China Cooperative Goods Station Changes Style, Business Expands
    Before May, the Tianjin North China Cooperative Goods Station neglected procurement and sales business with various cooperatives due to being busy with its own business operations. In addition, there was a serious problem of bureaucracy and a bureaucratic work style, which greatly hindered business development, resulting in a sharp decline in transaction volume. After leading cadres conducted inspections and called on cadres to closely connect with residents and change their style, business has recently seen daily expansion. Transaction volume has increased from an average of over 200 million yuan per day to 1.2 billion yuan, with a maximum of 5.1 billion yuan in one day.

    郑州百货公司超额回笼货币
    郑州百货公司五月份继续贯彻稳定物价的方针，全月回笼货币二十六亿六千万元，超过原定任务二十四亿元的百分之一○·八三。该公司为此将举行评功评模，借资勉励在工作中积极负责的人员。对工作漠不关心者亦将受到批评。
    又在市价下落时，该公司及时投放大量货币，收购市场上滞销的商品。如在四月下旬到五月二十七日这一段时期中，该公司就投放了货币共十四亿余元，使市场物价逐渐上提与公司牌价接近。

    苏州粮食支公司扭转机关化作风
    中国粮食公司苏州支公司，五月份经大力改进工作方法，扭转过去长期存在的机关化作风，使全月回笼任务超过原计划百分之二五·一二。
    天津华北合作货栈转变作风生意开展
    天津华北合作货栈，于五月份前，因忙于本身业务经营，对各地社购销业务即形忽略，加之本身严重存在官僚主义与机关化作风，大大阻碍了业务发展，致使交易额锐减。后经领导干部对此作了检查，号召干部密切联系住客，转变作风，最近生意已日见开展。交易额由平均每日二亿余元增至十二亿元，最多一天曾达到过五十一亿元。
