　　Tianjin Farmers' Service Cooperative Handles Purchasing and Sales on Commission
　　Farmers Save Over 20 Million Yuan in Three Months
　　[Tianjin News] According to the Tianjin Daily, the Farmers' Service Cooperative under the Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has played a significant role in serving farmers and promoting mutual assistance and material exchange between urban and rural areas. The main work of the cooperative from January to March was: (1) Establishing exchange venues and handling purchasing and sales on commission to facilitate direct exchange among farmers from various regions. Public enterprises, factories, consumer cooperatives, and other departments could also purchase or sell goods at the markets under the cooperative's leadership. In three months, this saved farmers over 6,471,000 yuan in handling fees (compared to market handling fees). Furthermore, the cooperative provided free accommodation and meals at 20% lower cost than private vendors. Statistics show that 15,000 farmers stayed at the cooperative in three months, saving them 17,965,000 yuan. (2) While developing purchasing and sales on commission, the cooperative assisted the government in tax collection. The tax bureau set up a tax collection office within the cooperative. From January to March, the total value of purchases and sales on commission exceeded 490 million yuan, with daily tax revenue reaching approximately 1 million yuan. (3) Establishing relationships with public enterprises to ensure farmers could exchange for necessary goods. For example, the Grain Company supplied coarse grains, the Salt Industry Company supplied edible salt, and cooperative warehouses supplied kerosene. In addition to various local products, waste materials such as rags, broken hemp fibers, scrap copper, and scrap iron from rural areas were also beneficial for industrial needs. (4) Coordinating with disaster relief efforts, organizing farmer transportation and sales teams, and organizing collective purchasing by farmers. This allowed farmers to use their own tools for quick round trips and operations, which they found very convenient.
