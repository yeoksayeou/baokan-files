Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch: The China Association for Promoting Democracy sent a telegram to the All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions Liaison Committee and the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, expressing sympathy and respect for the "May 30th" incident. The telegram reads as follows:

To the All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions Liaison Committee and the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations:

We express our deep indignation at the malicious creation of an "incident" by the American occupiers during the Tokyo People's Congress on May 30th, and the illegal arrest and interrogation of eight patriots from your country. We extend our sincere sympathy and respect to the heroic and persecuted people of your country.

Today's situation shows very clearly that the national liberation movement and the people's democratic movement of the Japanese people will surely move forward and will surely be victorious. However, imperialism and its running dogs, in order to prolong their criminal rule, will inevitably continue to intensify their attacks and persecution of the people. Resolutely struggle, strengthen unity, and victory will surely belong to you. Although there are many thorns, the light is in sight. We sincerely wish you glorious success as brothers!

China Association for Promoting Democracy

    对日本人民斗争表示敬意
    同济大学学生声援日本青年
    【新华社八日讯】中国民主促进会致电全日工会联络委员会和全日学生自治会联合会，对“五·三○”事表示同情和敬意。电文如下：全日工会联络委员会全日学生自治会联合会：
    五月三十日东京人民大会中，美国占领者恶意制造“事件”，非法逮捕和审讯贵国八位爱国者，我们深表愤慨，并对英勇而横遭迫害的贵国人民，谨致诚挚的同情和敬意。
    今天的形势显示得很明白：日本人民的民族解放运动与人民民主运动，一定要向前发展，一定要获得胜利。但是帝国主义及其走狗，为了苟延他们罪恶的统治，亦必将继续加紧其对人民的进攻和迫害。坚决斗争，巩固团结，胜利必将属于你们。荆棘虽多，光明在望，我们谨以兄弟之诚，预祝你们光荣的成功！
