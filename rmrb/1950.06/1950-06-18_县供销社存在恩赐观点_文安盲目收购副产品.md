　　The County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Exhibits Patronizing Attitudes;
    Wen'an Blindly Purchases Sideline Products
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Wen'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative seriously exhibits patronizing attitudes and bureaucratic work styles. When purchasing sideline products from the masses, it does not strictly implement the contract stipulations, resulting in purchased finished products being unable to be sold and a large amount of capital being tied up and unable to circulate.

    During the disaster relief and production campaign last winter and this spring, the cooperative achieved great success in supporting disaster victims' production, supplying production materials, and promoting finished products; and it strengthened the organization of cooperatives during the campaign. However, according to an inspection on May 3, due to the existence of a purely patronizing attitude and blind purchasing, the county and district cooperatives have a total of 31,857 bolts of homespun cloth (each bolt costing 32 jin of corn) and 66,907 mats in stock. There are also crude saltpeter and saltpeter temporarily stored according to instructions from higher authorities. In addition to tying up all the county cooperative's working capital and preventing it from circulating, it also owes the county government 30,000 jin of disaster relief grain, 50,000 jin of grain subsidies for military dependents (both allocated to the district cooperatives by the county government through the county cooperative), and 1.1 million jin of corn in loans from the special district general cooperative. At the same time, on April 27, the county cooperative, due to a shortage of grain, instructed the sixth and seventh branch cooperatives to stop purchasing mats, but the two branch cooperatives continued to purchase as before. The seventh district branch cooperative alone purchased 6,025 mats on credit in three days. After the mat weavers sold on credit, they lacked working capital, which affected production.

    There are two main reasons for blind purchasing: First, each cooperative has a patronizing attitude, proceeding purely from disaster relief, and accepting masses' homespun cloth and reed mats regardless of whether they meet specifications, making them impossible to sell. When some cooperatives signed contracts for mat purchases, they had already issued grain in advance. They were afraid that if they did not accept the mats, the mat weavers would not be able to fulfill the contract, so they themselves lowered the authority and credibility of the contract, causing many mat weavers to neglect improving quality, or not act according to the contract, and some even failed to deliver on time.

    Second, some branch cooperatives did not follow the county cooperative's instructions, and were seriously disorganized and undisciplined. For example, for homespun cloth, the county cooperative began to issue three instructions and five notices to each branch cooperative to stop purchasing as early as February, but the third district continued to purchase until April 16, purchasing 4,890 bolts in April, of which 80% should not have been purchased. Moreover, because other cooperatives had stopped purchasing, it caused dissatisfaction among the masses towards other branch cooperatives. On April 15, the county cooperative held a meeting of branch cooperative directors, emphasizing signing fewer contracts with advance grain issuance and later product collection, and expanding the scope of transactions, in order to leverage capital turnover capacity, but the seventh district branch cooperative, after returning, signed contracts to issue 16,000 jin of grain in advance within four days. The director of the branch cooperative believed that not issuing grain would affect production, thereby fostering the masses' mentality of dependency.

### 县供销社存在恩赐观点  文安盲目收购副产品

　　县供销社存在恩赐观点
    文安盲目收购副产品
    【本报讯】文安县供销社严重存在恩赐观点与官僚主义作风，在收购群众副业产品时，不严格执行合同规定，致收购成品无法销出而使大量资金积压，不能周转。
    该社在去冬今春两季生产救灾运动中，在扶植灾民生产、供给生产原料与推销成品上均做出很大成绩；并在运动中发展壮大了合作社的组织。但据五月三日检查，由于存在着单纯的恩赐观点，盲目收购，致县、区社共积压产品土布三万一千八百五十七匹（每匹开支玉米三十二斤），席六万六千九百零七片。另有按上级指示暂时收存的皮硝、火硝等。除使县社全部活动资金积压不能周转外，尚欠县政府赈粮三万斤，军属补助粮五万斤（均为县政府通过县社拨到区分社的），欠专区总社贷售粮一百一十万斤玉米。同时，四月二十七日，县社因缺粮已指示六、七两分社停止收席，但该两分社仍照旧进行收购，仅七区分社三天就赊购了六千零二十五片席。席民赊售后，因无活动资金，致影响了生产。
    盲目收购的主要原因有二：首先是各社存在着恩赐观点，从单纯救灾出发，群众土布、苇席来者就收，大部不合规格也不管，致使无法推销。有的社订收席合同时，多已先发给粮食，不收又怕席民不能履行合同，以致本身先降低了合同的威信和信用，造成许多席民忽视提高质量，或不按合同办事，甚至有逾期不交者。
    其次是有的分社不遵守县社指示，严重的无组织无纪律。如土布一项，县社远在二月即开始三次指示、五次通知各分社停止收购，但三区至四月十六日仍在继续收购，计四月份收购了四千八百九十匹，其中有百分之八十是不应收购的。且因其他社已停止收购而引起了群众对其他分社的不满。四月十五日县社召开分社主任会议，为发挥资金周转能力，强调少订先发粮后收产品的合同，扩大交易面，但七区分社回去后，四天内即订合同先发粮食一万六千斤。该分社主任认为不发粮会影响生产，因而助长了群众的依赖思想。
