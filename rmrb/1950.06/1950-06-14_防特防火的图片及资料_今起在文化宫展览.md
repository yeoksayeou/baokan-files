　　Exhibition of Anti-Espionage and Fire Prevention Pictures and Materials Opens Today at the Cultural Palace
　　[News Dispatch from Kyoto City] The Kyoto City Public Security Bureau's anti-espionage and fire safety exhibition will be held at the Labor People's Cultural Palace for half a month starting today (the 14th). The exhibition content is divided into five parts. The first part exposes the Kuomintang bandit gang's special agent organizational system. The second part uses comic strips to record the crimes of special agents in oppressing the people and endangering the revolution before liberation, including the evil deeds of KMT bandit gang-supported special agent students persecuting progressive students, humiliating female students, and oppressing the masses in schools. The third part exposes the sabotage activities carried out by American imperialist and KMT special agents who sneaked into Kyoto after liberation, including the cases of KMT special agent Ji Zhaonan and American agent Xiong Xianli. The fourth part is a fire prevention feature, with detailed analysis of the causes of fires and prevention methods. The fifth part introduces the general situation of factory security work in Kyoto over the past year. The above exhibition photos profoundly expose the harm of the Jiang-American special agents to the people's revolutionary cause and their deliberate sabotage plot against the people's capital. At the same time, it clearly tells us that to safeguard the capital and ensure the smooth progress of construction, we must raise vigilance and prevent all kinds of conspiracies and sabotage by enemy agents.
