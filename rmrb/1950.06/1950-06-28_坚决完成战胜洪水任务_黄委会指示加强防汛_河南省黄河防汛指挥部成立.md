　　Resolutely Complete the Task of Defeating Floods
    Yellow River Commission Instructs Strengthening Flood Control
    Henan Province Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters Established
    [Kaifeng Dispatch] The Yellow River Conservancy Commission, in order to implement the spirit of the National Flood Control Conference and resolutely complete the tasks stipulated by the Central Government (Editor's Note: The task assigned to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission by the Central Government is to prevent floods higher than those of 1949, and under normal circumstances, to ensure that no breaches occur when the flow at Shaan County is 17,000 cubic meters per second.), and to protect the lives and property of the 100 million people along the river, issued instructions on June 7 to strengthen flood control. The instructions pointed out that, based on the central government's stipulations and in light of the specific conditions of the Yellow River, the specific tasks for this year are: to ensure that no breaches occur when the flow at Gaocun in Pingyuan Province is 11,000 cubic meters per second, and the flow at Luokou in Shandong is 8,500 cubic meters per second.
    Based on the experience of defeating floods in previous years, and after analyzing the favorable conditions and actual difficulties in completing the task, the instructions emphasized that it is entirely possible to overcome the difficulties and defeat the floods. It pointed out that ten tasks must be done well, and emphatically proposed the "Six Steps, Three Keys," which must rely on the masses and be vigorously carried out in order to complete the task. The first step is to publicize and mobilize, and do a good job in preparation. Conduct a thorough inspection of the dikes and dangerous works to eliminate hidden dangers and repair dangerous works; allocate materials to meet needs, and organize communication tools and transportation equipment before the flood season. The second step is to do meticulous and strict organizational work. Quickly establish unified flood control headquarters at all levels under the leadership of the local Party and government organs; flood control personnel should be universally organized according to river dikes and river conditions, appropriately allocated, and flexibly controlled; defend the entire line and strengthen key points. The third step is to investigate and study, analyze the enemy (flood) and ourselves, and know ourselves and the enemy. Organize special personnel to study river conditions, dikes, and water conditions; conduct frequent inspections, analyze more, and strengthen the leadership's foresight, and oppose complacency and bureaucracy. The fourth step is to strictly defend and prevent problems before they occur. After the high water arrives, patrol day and night, and discover and remedy weaknesses in the dikes in a timely manner. The fifth step is to maintain a high degree of vigilance from beginning to end during the high flood period, increase inspections, establish smooth intelligence, and maintain close contact between superiors and subordinates; at the same time, organize anti-espionage and anti-special forces to prevent sabotage by hidden enemies. The sixth step is to quickly and stubbornly conduct emergency repairs and plugging of leaks. In ordinary times, workers and the broad masses should be educated to learn emergency repair and plugging techniques, and once a dangerous situation occurs, concentrate all efforts and bravely and stubbornly carry out emergency plugging. The instructions pointed out that publicity and mobilization, organizational work, and bravely and stubbornly carrying out emergency plugging are the three keys to defeating floods. The instructions hoped that flood control headquarters at all levels would earnestly study and implement the above spirit in light of local conditions.
    [Another Dispatch] According to the instructions of the Central Government and the Yellow River Commission, Henan Province formally established the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters on June 15. Niu Peicong, Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Government, was appointed as the Director, and Liu Pengxu, Director of the Military Region Office, and Sun Zhanbiao, Deputy Director of the River Affairs Bureau, were appointed as Deputy Directors. The meeting adopted a decision on flood control work, requiring all levels of command headquarters to complete all preparations for flood control by July 10.
