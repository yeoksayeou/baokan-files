【Beijing News Agency Dispatch】 The First District People's Representative Conference of Beijing Municipality opened yesterday (the 28th) at 2:00 PM. Zhang Youyu and Wu Han, Deputy Mayors of Beijing Municipality, and Qian Duansheng, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, attended the meeting to provide guidance. Deputy Mayor Zhang and Vice Chairman Qian Duansheng delivered impromptu speeches. Yesterday's meeting included work reports by the District Chief of the First District and the Chief of the First Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau.

In his speech, Deputy Mayor Zhang emphasized the significant meaning of convening the district's People's Representative Conference for further developing people's democratic politics. On behalf of the Municipal Government, he gave instructions on the three main issues to be discussed at this meeting: inspecting the work style of cadres, increasing the welfare of residents, and repairing houses. He hoped that all representatives would uphold the spirit of "saying everything you know and saying it without reservation," and actively offer suggestions to assist the people's own government and staff in better carrying out various construction projects.

Qian Duansheng, Vice Chairman of the Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, emphasized in his speech that this meeting, like the Sixth and Seventh District People's Representative Conferences held not long ago, would make great contributions to the construction of democratic power in Beijing and even in major cities across the country. He encouraged all representatives to work together to make this a successful meeting.

Su Jie, District Chief of the First District, reported on the work of the First District Office in the past year. Regarding the work guidelines and plans for the next half-year, he pointed out: in addition to focusing on and appropriately improving the environmental sanitation within the district, strengthening leadership in production work, developing social education, and especially focusing on solving the problem of out-of-school children of the working people, they will also launch a summer sanitation campaign to prevent the spread of epidemics. With housing issues as the focus, they will quickly clear all pending cases in the mediation department. Zhao Lian, Chief of the First Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, reported on the public security work of the past year, explaining that in the future, in addition to further consolidating revolutionary order under the direct leadership of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, they will also strengthen fire prevention work, educate public security personnel, and improve the work style of public security personnel.

Among the guests yesterday were Li Leguang, representative of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Ling Qijun, representative of the preparatory committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Liu Junying, representative of the Municipal Women's Federation, who all delivered speeches and congratulations to the meeting in succession.
