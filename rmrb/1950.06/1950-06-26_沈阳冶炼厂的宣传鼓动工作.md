The propaganda and mobilization work of the Shenyang Smelting Plant has gradually strengthened with the development of the New Record Movement.

Under the leadership of the Party and the specific organization of the Trade Union, they specially established an organization to carry out this work, absorbing the cultural and educational committee members of each branch and the active elements of propaganda and mobilization work, and established the plant's Cultural and Educational Committee. Under it are groups for night school, communications, comics, singing, drama, ball games, and writing. The plant also has three cultural and educational committee members and staff members who are detached from production. The cultural and educational committee members of each branch and the cultural and educational staff members of the trade union group regularly organize this work directly. In addition, there are more than seventy active elements who are enthusiastic about propaganda and mobilization work, distributed in various departments and workshops, mostly on-site workers.

The propaganda and mobilization work of the smelting plant has become a powerful weapon for promoting production. Its most basic feature is to make propaganda and mobilization work closely serve production, which is the basic reason why it can become a powerful weapon for promoting production. The content and slogans of their propaganda and mobilization are proposed according to the needs of production tasks, and are organized specifically based on different situations and needs in the specific process of production. Under this general spirit, the propaganda and mobilization work of the plant shows four characteristics: mass character, timeliness, specificity, and diversity:

I. Mass Character: The propaganda and mobilization work of the smelting plant has a mass character. Not only is the content of propaganda and mobilization fully adapted to the current requirements of the workers, but also the form of propaganda and mobilization work is adapted to the needs of the workers. From the plant headquarters to the workshop, from the plant courtyard to the office, in important places, in places where workers often pass by going to and from work, in workers' lounges, and in health canteens, blackboards, production charts, circulars, express reports, and comics are arranged everywhere according to needs and environmental characteristics, making it convenient for everyone to accept. Looking at the composition of participants in this work, it is also the same. There are activists among the workers, staff members, and technicians. The Party branch and the Trade Union lead this work. The plant director also uses various opportunities to carry out propaganda and mobilization. Therefore, it is often seen that a worker is still writing production express reports in the workshop office after work, or filling in the daily production comparison table in the workshop lounge, and surrounding him are workers who have just finished work. It can also be seen that when a worker injures his foot, the plant director immediately writes a letter of condolence; when a deputy section chief refuses to accept a gold ingot offered as a bribe by a private construction company, the plant director, the Party committee secretary, and the director of the Trade Union jointly sign a circular to reward him. Making propaganda and mobilization work a mass and universal activity can achieve a broader and deeper effect on ensuring production.

II. Timeliness: Propaganda and mobilization workers can conduct timely propaganda on major and minor events in production. The blackboards of each workshop are directly responsible by the cultural and educational committee members of the workshop branch and the cultural and educational staff members of the trade union group. These people are not detached from production, so they can always find vivid materials, and they can write one or two sentences of mobilization text at any time, taking advantage of the gaps between shifts. Therefore, it is very timely, and a issue can be published in one or two days, sometimes several issues a day. Workers also constantly write articles, the content of which is mostly the production situation of the workshop that day, such as who produced well, who created a new record, who did not complete the task, etc. The following figures also show its timely and regular characteristics. As of March this year, the blackboards of various departments and workshops numbered forty-two, and have published ninety-three issues, express reports have published forty-two to fifty-two issues, comics have published more than fifty, hero lists have published nine issues with a total of one hundred and nineteen photos, wall newspapers have published thirteen issues, the plant's big chimney newspaper has published sixteen issues, and workers perform plays themselves once a week. Only by constantly changing and constantly changing the form and content of propaganda and mobilization according to the requirements of the production situation can propaganda and mobilization work better play its role in promoting production.

III. Specificity: In the propaganda and mobilization work in enterprises, it is not enough to talk about general principles; the more specific, the more vivid and powerful. It is inseparable from specific numbers here. The propaganda and mobilization work in the workshops of the smelting plant sometimes only uses one or two sentences, or a simple number, and publishes it on the blackboard or express report in a timely manner, which can play a great role. For example, "Group × produced how many tons of copper more than the task in ten days, and will continue to work harder in the future!" Such as "Which class has no absenteeism, how much absenteeism in which class!" For example, in order to persuade workers to pay attention to eating health eggs, a large and obvious table was made and pasted in the health canteen to compare and explain that the nutritional value of eating eggs is better than eating rice. These methods are specific, fresh, and flexible, and can naturally receive greater results. This kind of specific mobilization work is combined with more propaganda and mobilization that explains a principle (which is of course also specific). Because only in this way can the political consciousness of the workers be gradually improved through vivid and powerful propaganda and mobilization, thereby combining economic work with political work.

IV. Diversity: Because the production work of the factory is complex, and the situations and requirements of various objects are different, the forms adopted for propaganda and mobilization work are also diverse. There are more than nineteen forms, such as blackboards, production charts, express reports, comics, hero lists, wall newspapers, theatrical performances, workshop red flags, exhibitions, circulars, letters of condolence, broadcasts, comparison tables, large chimney newspapers, clippings, reading newspapers, advanced producer meetings, workshop production meetings, and oral propaganda. More than eight forms are frequently used in the workshop. Most of these forms are eye-catching, easy to understand, interspersed, short and powerful, and unrestrained. In this way, they are easily welcomed by the masses and give play to the power of propaganda and mobilization work.

The propaganda and mobilization work of the Shenyang Smelting Plant serves production and has the above-mentioned characteristics, so it has a great effect on promoting production. Specifically, it is:

First, it turns the production plan into simple and popular mobilization slogans, so that the production plan can be completed victoriously. When the Shenyang Smelting Plant arranged the production plan for May, they requested that the entire plan for the first half of the year be completed in May. The detailed production plan is in a booklet. If it is generally conveyed, it will cause headaches. According to the current situation of the development of production in the smelting plant, the main current requirement is to reduce costs. To reduce costs, it is necessary to improve and improve technology. Therefore, they turned this production task into a popular mobilization slogan, proposing: "Improve technology, create new records for reducing costs, greet Red May, and strive to complete the semi-annual task by the end of May!" This slogan unified different contents such as "improving technology, reducing costs, creating new records, the work of Red May, and the completion of the May production plan" into a mobilization slogan. In terms of practice, it is more simply proposed: "Focus on cost, start with technology!" This makes it easy for the lower levels to remember and master, and it also forms the plant's struggle slogan. This is of great significance for striving for the realization of the production plan.

When they arranged the production tasks for May, they also convened a meeting of advanced producers attended by 153 advanced producers from the entire plant, including a wide range of aspects, including cadres, technicians, staff members, Party branch secretaries, squad leaders, and workers. At this meeting, many advanced producers made typical reports and introduced advanced experiences. The venue was filled with slogans and charts related to completing the May production tasks and the April production results, as well as comics and hero lists of production models. All advanced producers also received awards. The various departments and workshops of the plant wrote congratulatory letters to this meeting on red paper, and also read out letters of encouragement from Soviet experts. This mass meeting was actually a very powerful mobilization meeting. Therefore, the one hundred and several advanced producers played a great role in promoting production after returning to the site.

Second, through propaganda and mobilization, the production progress is grasped in the workshop, and the production efficiency is improved. For example, their production charts, there are fifty-eight kinds in the whole plant, including various comparison tables, such as rewards and punishments, attendance, new records, etc. twenty-six sheets, product statistics tables such as crude copper, electrolytic copper, etc. thirty sheets, labor performance tables nine sheets, distributed in various departments and on various sites. These charts vary in style, some are simple and clear, some use red and blue pens to mark the production situation of each group, which group is good and which group is bad, at a glance, literate or illiterate can understand. In addition, there are also charts made of blackboards, using red, blue and yellow colors as marks, blue indicates the original planned production number, red indicates the actual completion and exceeding the production task number, and yellow indicates the number that has not completed the task. This kind of production chart is drawn once a day, so that everyone knows how much the production task is, how much has been completed, and how much is still lacking. This is not only one of the best forms of propaganda and mobilization, but also the best way to plan production and manage production.

When requiring to improve production efficiency, reduce absenteeism, and save tools, they also flexibly and timely carried out propaganda and mobilization work. For example, in February, the roasting furnace was not good due to poor ore, and the lump rate decreased. Administratively, it was called to improve the lump rate. Worker Zhao Baisui only burned out 10% of the lump rate, and worker Xin Lianfen, after research, burned out 65% of the lump rate. The Trade Union seized this material and immediately put a slogan on the blackboard to the workers: "Eliminate Zhao Baisui! Establish Xin Lianfen!" Although this slogan may be misunderstood, it did have an effect. As a result, Zhao Baisui also burned out 65% of the lump rate.

Third, when difficulties arise in production, revolutionary competitions are launched through propaganda and mobilization to solve the difficulties. In January, the weather was severely cold, and the ore-loading team of the smelting department had difficulty loading frozen ore. If this difficulty is not resolved, production will be difficult to proceed normally. The Party branch secretary of the workshop mobilized at the branch meeting, proposing the slogan: "Party members take the lead in breaking through the difficulty of loading frozen ore!" At the same time, Party members were called upon to combine with the masses. Through the mobilization of Party members among the workers, each group launched a competition. Class C did not improve the amount of ore loaded on the first day, so they immediately wrote on the blackboard: "Class C! Do you not want to compete? Why didn't you complete the task on the first day?" This question-and-answer slogan was very timely and powerful because it was related to the beginning of a production competition. Sure enough, later, the entire class C moved, and as a result, the amount of ore loaded was higher than that of any other class. They tightly grasped this example and immediately announced the results of each class on the blackboard. The classes with poor results were not convinced, and the production competition was launched again. After this competition, the difficulty of hitting and loading frozen ore was overcome, ensuring the supply of raw materials, and as a result, the under-lump rate increased from 40% to 70%.

It is the same when solving technical difficulties. For example, the workshop put forward a slogan: "The scene is the church, and the accident is the teaching material!" This slogan mobilized the technicians to go deep into the scene to solve the specific difficulties existing on the scene.

In addition, when a temporary surprise task comes, they concentrate on using various appropriate forms of propaganda and mobilization to carry out extensive propaganda and mobilization. For example, when the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance was signed, more than forty blackboards, wall newspapers, express reports, and broadcasting equipment in the plant concentrated their efforts, and cooperated with symposiums to promote the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

Of course, this method of concentrating on a specific content and uniformly using various forms of propaganda and mobilization cannot be used lightly. It can only be used when a pressing and universal practical task comes that is worth using this method, otherwise it may affect the normal progress of propaganda and mobilization work.

The propaganda and mobilization work of the Shenyang Smelting Plant is significant for promoting production, but there are also some shortcomings, such as: the Party's regular leadership of this work is not enough, it cannot regularly check and summarize this work, and improve this work. The propaganda and mobilization work is still uneven, some departments are active, and some departments are poor. These shortcomings need to be improved in the future.

　　沈阳冶炼厂的宣传鼓动工作
    李潜
    沈阳冶炼厂的宣传鼓动工作，是随着新纪录运动的开展而逐渐加强起来的。
    在党的领导和工会的具体组织之下，他们专门建立了具体进行这一工作的组织，吸收了各分会的文教委员及宣传鼓动工作的活动分子，成立了全厂的文教委员会。下设夜校、通讯、漫画、歌咏、戏剧、球类、编写等小组。全厂并有三个脱离生产的文教委员和干事。各支会的文教委员及工会小组的文教干事都经常直接组织这一工作。另外有七十多个热心宣传鼓动工作的积极分子，他们分布在各部和各个车间里，大部分都是现场的工友。
    冶炼厂的宣传鼓动工作，已经成为一种推动生产的有力武器了。它的最基本的特点就是使宣传鼓动工作密切地服务于生产，这也就是他能够成为推动生产的有力武器的基本原因。他们的宣传鼓动的内容和口号是根据生产任务的需要而提出的，又是在生产的具体进行中，依据不同的情况和需要而具体来进行组织的。该厂的宣传鼓动工作在这种总的精神下表现着群众性、及时性、具体性、多样性等四个特点：
    一、群众性：冶炼厂的宣传鼓动工作是带有群众性的，不仅宣传鼓动的内容，完全适应当前工人群众的要求，即宣传鼓动工作的形式，也是适应工人群众的需要的。从厂部到车间，从厂院到办公室，在冲要的地方，在工人上下班常经过的地方，在工人休息室里，在保健食堂里，到处都根据需要和环境的特点布置了黑板报、生产图表、通报、快报、漫画，便利于大家接受。再从参加进行这一工作的成分来看，也是如此。有工人中间的积极分子，有职员，有技术人员。党的支部和工会就是领导这一工作的。厂长也利用各种时机进行宣传鼓动。因此常常可以看到一个工友在下班后还在车间办公室里写生产快报，或者车间休息室里填写每日生产比较表，而围在他周围的正是刚刚下班的工友。也可以看到当一个工友砸了脚，厂长立即写信慰问；当一个副股长拒绝接受私营建筑公司贿送给他的一个金溜子时，厂长、党委书记、工会主任，立即联合签名通报奖励。使宣传鼓动工作成为群众性、普遍性的活动，就能收到在保证生产上的更广泛更深刻的效果。
    二、及时性：宣传鼓动工作者，对生产上的大小事，都能及时进行宣传。各车间的黑板报，都是由车间支会文教委员及工会小组文教干事直接负责。这些人是不脱离生产的，所以时刻能找到生动的材料，利用上下班的空隙，随时就可写好一两句的鼓动文字。因此非常及时，一天或两天就可出一期，有时一天出数期。工友们也不断写稿，内容多是当天车间的生产情况，如那个人生产好，那个人创了新纪录，那个人没有完成任务等。从下面的数目字来看，也可以看出其及时经常的特点，截至今年三月止，各部车间的黑板报四十二块，已出九十三期，快报出四十二到五十二期。漫画出五十余张。英雄榜出九期共照片一百一十九张。壁报出十三期，全厂的大烟筒报出十六期，工人自己演剧每周一次。只有随着生产情况的要求，经常变动和经常改换宣传鼓动的形式和内容，才能使宣传鼓动工作更好地发挥其对生产的推动作用。
    三、具体性：企业中的宣传鼓动工作，不能只讲大道理，越具体就越生动有力。在这里是脱离不开具体数目字的。冶炼厂的车间的宣传鼓动工作有时只用一句或两句话，或者一个简单的数目字，在黑板报上或快报上及时公布，就起很大作用。如“第×组十天出铜超过任务多少吨，今后还要加油！”如“某班没有缺勤的，某班缺勤多少！”又如为了说服工友重视吃保健鸡蛋，就制成一个大而明显的表贴在保健食堂里，来比较说明吃鸡蛋要比吃大米的营养价值好。这些方式又具体、又新鲜、又灵活，自能收到较大的效果。这种具体的鼓动工作，和更多的说明一个道理的宣传鼓动（当然也是具体的）是结合进行的。因为只有这样，才能通过生动有力的宣传鼓动，来逐渐提高工人群众的政治觉悟。从而把经济工作与政治工作结合起来。
    四、多样性：因为工厂的生产工作是复杂的，各种对象的情况要求不同，因此，他们进行宣传鼓动工作所采用的形式也是多种多样的，有黑板报、生产图表、快报、漫画、英雄榜、壁报、演剧、车间红旗、展览会、通报、慰问信、广播、比较表、大烟筒报、剪报、读报、先进生产者会议、车间生产会议、口头宣传等十九种形式以上。在车间经常运用的形式有八种以上。这些形式，大部分都是醒目易懂，穿插运用，短小有力，不受拘束。这样就容易被群众所欢迎而发挥了宣传鼓动工作的力量。
    沈阳冶炼厂的宣传鼓动工作既是服务于生产，而又具备上述的各种特点，因之推动生产的作用很大，分别说来是：
    第一、把生产计划变成简明通俗的鼓动口号，使生产计划得以胜利完成。沈阳冶炼厂布置五月份的生产计划时，他们曾要求在五月份完成今年上半年全部的计划任务。详细的生产计划有一本子，如果泛泛的去传达，就会叫人听了头痛。他们根据冶炼厂生产发展的现状，当前主要的要求应是降低成本，要降低成本就必须提高和改进技术，于是他们就把这个生产任务变成了通俗的鼓动口号，提出：“提高技术，创造降低成本的新纪录，迎接红五月，为五月底完成半年任务而奋斗！”这个口号就把“提高技术，降低成本，创造新记录，红五月的工作，五月生产计划的完成”等这些不同的内容统一起来，变成一个带有动员性的斗争口号了。在作法上更简明的提出：“成本着眼，技术着手！”这样就容易让下面记忆和掌握，也就形成了全厂的斗争口号。这对争取生产计划的实现有很大的意义。
    当他们布置五月份生产任务的时候，又召开了全厂一百五十三名先进生产者参加的先进生产者会议，包括的方面相当广泛，干部，技术员，职员，党的支部书记，班长，工友全体参加。这个会议上，很多生产先进者作了典型报告，介绍了先进经验。会场上布满了有关完成五月生产任务和四月生产成绩的口号，图表，此外并有生产模范的漫画、英雄榜。全体先进生产者并受了奖。该厂的各部及车间给这个会用红纸写来了贺信，又宣读了苏联专家的鼓励信。这个群众性的会议，实际上就是个很有力的鼓动会议。所以一百几十名先进生产者回到现场后，对推动生产起了很大的作用。
    第二、通过宣传鼓动，在车间来掌握生产进度，并提高生产效率。如他们的生产图表，全厂有五十八种，其中有各种比较表，如奖惩、出缺勤、新纪录等二十六张，产品统计表如粗铜、电铜等三十张，劳动成绩表九张，分布在各部及各个现场上。这些图表样式不一，有的简单明了，有的用红蓝笔标出各组的生产情形，那组好那组坏，一目了然，识字不识字都能看得懂。另外还有用黑板制成的图表，用红蓝黄三种颜色作标记，蓝色表示原计划生产数，红色表示实际完成和超过生产任务数，黄色表示没完成任务数。这种生产图表，一天一画，使每个人都知道生产任务是多少，已完成了多少，还差多少。这不仅是宣传鼓动的最好形式之一，同时也是计划生产和管理生产的最好办法之一。
    在要求提高生产效率、减少旷工、节省工具时，他们也灵活而及时的进行了宣传鼓动工作。如二月间，焙烧炉因旷矿不好，块率降低，行政上就号召提高块率，工友赵百岁只烧出百分之十的块率，工友辛连芬经过研究烧出百分之六十五的块率。工会抓住这个材料，立刻就在黑板报上向工友提出一个口号：“消灭赵百岁！树立辛连芬！”虽然这个口号可能被人误会，但却发生了作用，结果赵百岁也烧出了百分之六十五的块率来。
    第三、在生产发生了困难时，就通过宣传鼓动，去发起革命竞赛，解决困难。一月份天气严寒，熔炼部的上矿股，冻矿难上。不解决这个困难，生产就难以正常进行。该车间党的支部书记，就在支部大会上进行了动员，提出口号：“党员带头，突破冻矿难上！”同时号召党员要和群众结合起来，通过党员在工人中的鼓动，各组就发起了竞赛。丙班第一天上矿量没有提高，就立刻在黑板报上写上：“丙班！你们不愿竞赛吗？怎么第一天就没完成任务？”这个带问答性的口号，很及时有力，因为它关系着一个生产竞赛的开端。果然后来丙班全体都动起来了，结果上矿量比那班都高。他们紧紧抓住这个例子，立刻又在黑板报上公布了各班的成绩，成绩坏的班就不服气，生产竞赛就又掀起来了。经过这次竞赛，克服了冻矿难打难上的困难，保证了原料的供给，结果使下块率从百分之四十提高到百分之七十。
    在解决技术困难时也是如此。如车间提出了一个口号：“现场就是教堂，事故就是教材！”这个口号鼓动了技术员的深入现场，去解决现场存在的具体困难。
    此外，当一个临时突击任务来到时，他们就集中使用各种适当的宣传鼓动形式，来展开广泛的宣传鼓动，如中苏友好同盟条约签订时，全厂四十多块黑板报、壁报、快报、广播器等集中力量，并配合座谈会，宣传中苏友好条约及中苏的伟大友谊。
    当然这种集中于一种具体内容，而统一使用各种宣传鼓动的形式的作法，不能轻易使用，只有当一个急迫而又带普遍性的现实任务来到而值得使用这种作法的时候，才能这样作，否则容易影响正常的宣传鼓动工作的进行。
    沈阳冶炼厂的宣传鼓动工作，对推动生产是显著的，但是也还存在一些缺点，如：党对这一工作的经常领导还不够，不能够经常检查和总结这一工作，提高这一工作。宣传鼓动工作进行的仍不平衡，有些部门活跃，有些部门较差，这些缺点，今后还须加以改进。
