(Xinhua News Agency, 24th) Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee, delivered a speech at the Second Meeting of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 22nd. The full text is as follows: Chairman, Members, Ladies and Gentlemen:

	I completely support the reports of the responsible comrades of the Central People's Government on land reform, economic and financial work, politics, diplomacy, military affairs, cultural education, and court work.

	The Central People's Government, in the eight months since its establishment, has achieved such great scale and success, and such grand plans and prospects, as have never been seen in Chinese history. This shows that only the People's Government can serve the people, and only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the will of the people be transformed into reality with such unprecedentedly great spirit and unprecedentedly magnificent strength.

	Many of you have spoken about the various achievements already made by the Central People's Government. I will now cite only a few specific facts to illustrate how much difficulty we faced and how much arduous struggle we had to go through to achieve these results.

	Disaster relief work is one of the hallmarks of the power of our People's Government. Last year, the total area of farmland affected by disasters of varying degrees across the country reached 121,156,000 mu, and the total number of disaster victims affected to varying degrees was approximately 40 million. Among them, the most severely affected disaster victims who were most in need of relief numbered about 7 million. The number of disaster victims was so large, and in some large disaster areas, they had reached a state of utter destitution and hopelessness, where they could not survive without relief. In some areas, rescue efforts were continuous, and new disasters occurred continuously. People reflected, "The Eighth Route Army saves people, but Heaven kills people!" Under the slogan of "No one is allowed to starve to death," the Central People's Government and local governments at all levels organized forces, adhered to the principle of grain transfer, production for self-salvation, and work relief, and persevered in their struggle. Now, they have basically overcome and triumphed over the famine.

	Nationwide grain transfer is one of the basic conditions for our disaster relief, famine control, and price stabilization. In history, probably no one has dared to conceive of doing this. Today, the People's Government has done so. As of now, nearly 1.4 million tons of grain have been transferred. Under the conditions of our backward transportation and vast land, to transport large quantities of grain from remote provinces and remote areas to various disaster areas and major cities is a huge task and a complex organizational undertaking. Just to transport this grain from remote villages to transportation lines, with each person carrying an average of 100 jin, would require mobilizing tens of millions of people, taking countless days, and overcoming countless unimaginable difficulties. Only the people's own government dares to do this, and has basically completed it.

	In terms of water conservancy projects, as of now, the people and the army have completed 350 million cubic meters of earthwork. If it were built into a dike one meter wide and one meter high, it could circle the equator more than eight times. According to the total of guarantees put forward by various regions, the benefit of this project is that if a flood similar to last year's occurs, 70 million mu of the 100 million mu of land flooded last year can be guaranteed to be protected from flooding. However, this guarantee still needs to be tested by this year's floods, unlike disaster relief work and grain transfer work, which have already been completed.

	Based on the above few things alone, it is sufficient to explain that what the people need, the government will definitely do, and what the government decides to do, it will definitely be able to do. It is with such confidence and on such a basis that the People's Government formulates plans and completes plans; and it is precisely through the People's Government that the will of the people is concentrated and expressed.

	We have achieved such great work achievements inseparable from Chairman Mao's leadership, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the leadership of the State Council and various committees of the Central People's Government. Equally important, to complete such arduous and complex tasks, it is unimaginable without the political level and high working enthusiasm of the local party leadership and the implementation of the local grass-roots cadres. Facts have proven that it is precisely because our local grass-roots cadres resolutely implement policies and have a tenacious and unyielding work spirit, leading the masses and overcoming countless difficulties, that they can complete such unimaginable tasks. Based on what I have seen and heard, the achievements of these comrades should be deservedly praised by the people. They usually do not complete tasks easily. The tasks are heavy and there are many difficulties. They often rely on their two legs to work tirelessly; they work in many remote villages, not with good nutrition but with very poor nutrition; they do not avoid working in the sun, but work under the sun; they often sleep on the ground, covered by the sky, with mosquitoes. But they never forget to implement policies, and are always thinking about completing tasks. Implementing policies, completing tasks, and serving the people wholeheartedly is all they have. Their material life is already very low, and many comrades still save some of their own food or clothing to help disaster victims. Their work tasks are not completed by signing documents in the office, but are completed in the masses with blood and sweat, with a selfless spirit. "Task" is already a very ordinary thing for them, but they still have to "endure grievances" for a certain period of time. For example, in water conservancy projects, sometimes the work starts here, but the benefit is there, and the work starts upstream, but the benefit is downstream. Before the backward regional concepts and localism in the masses are completely overcome, some complaints are inevitable. In the grain transportation work, it is also inevitable to suffer temporary suspicion or complaints. Without a high degree of political awareness and policy viewpoints, it is not easy to complete tasks.

	This is the style and outlook of our new grass-roots cadres in new democratic construction.

	Some people are not without criticism of the cadres. I believe that individual deviations and shortcomings do exist, but some of these deviations and shortcomings are unavoidable in completing tasks, and some can be completely overcome through internal and external criticism and self-criticism within the party, and through continuous learning and education. As for criminals, the People's Government never tolerates them.

	Land reform issue. I wholeheartedly support Vice Chairman Liu's report and the proposed Land Reform Law. We rely on these strong local grass-roots cadres to implement such a perfect Land Reform Law, and we are full of confidence in achieving land reform in a guided, planned, and orderly manner.

	Of course, such a huge revolutionary project as land reform will encounter difficulties in the actual implementation process, and some people will feel pain. Because this is class struggle, not class reconciliation. Since it is a revolution, changing property relations inevitably involves struggle, and since a sore has grown, surgery is required, so it is impossible not to feel considerable pain. We are confident that we can completely overcome these difficulties and have a guarantee of successfully completing the task of land reform. Because we have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, which adheres to seeking truth from facts and controls policies, the perfect Land Reform Law negotiated and formulated at this meeting, and the local grass-roots cadres who work diligently, implement policies, and complete tasks. This will enable us to reduce deviations, reduce resistance, and properly and steadily complete the land reform work.

	In the eight months of work, the Central People's Government, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, has achieved extremely great work achievements. This is the glory of the Central People's Government, and of course also the glory of the National Committee of the CPPCC.

	The task before us is to strive for a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, and the fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation is based on completing land reform, developing rural productive forces, and adjusting industry and commerce as its basic prerequisites. We are confident that we can overcome all difficulties and complete this glorious historical task.

	Let us unite closely under the banner of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and advance for the long-term happiness of the people and the bright and brilliant future of the country!

	Let us shout:

	Glory to Chairman Mao! Happiness belongs to all the working people!

### 绥远军政委员会主席  傅作义的发言

    绥远军政委员会主席
    傅作义的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】绥远军政委员会主席傅作义二十二日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    听了中央人民政府负责同志关于土地改革，财经工作，政治，外交，军事及文化教育，法院工作等各项报告，我完全拥护。
    中央人民政府成立，八个月的时间，工作的规模和成绩，如此之大，计划和远景如此之壮伟，在中国历史上是不曾有过的。这说明只有人民政府，才能给人民办事，也只有在中国共产党领导之下，才能以这样空前伟大的气魄和空前壮阔的力量，把人民的意志变成事实。
    中央人民政府所已获得的各项成绩，各位的发言说的很多，我现在只举出几件具体事实，说明我们是在如何困难的情况下，要经过多少艰苦斗争，才作出这些成绩。
    救灾工作是我们人民政府表现力量的标志之一。去年全国被灾程度不同的农田达一万万二千一百五十六万亩，受灾轻重不同的灾民，共约四千万人。其中最需要救济的重灾民，约达七百万人。灾民人数如此之众，并且在相当大的灾区内，到了一无所有非救不活的绝望程度。有些地区还是连续抢救，又连续发生新的灾情。人民反映说：“八路救人，老天杀人！”中央人民政府和各级地方人民政府，在“不许饿死一个人”的口号下，以粮食调运，生产自救和以工代赈的方针，组织力量，坚持奋斗，现在已经基本上度过和战胜了灾荒。
    全国范围的粮食调运，是我们救灾度荒和稳定物价的基本条件之一。这个工作，在历史上恐怕还没有人敢于这样设想过，今天人民政府这样做了，截至现在已调运了将近一百四十万吨粮食。在我们交通工具如此落后而土地又这样广大的条件下，要把大量粮食从边远省份和偏僻的地方，送到各个灾区和各大都市，是一个如何巨大的任务和复杂的组织工作。只是把这些粮食从偏僻乡村送到交通线上，每人平均担一百斤，就需要动员几千万人，做多少时日，和克服多少难以想像的困难。只有人民自己的政府，才敢于这样做，并且在基本上把它完成了。
    在水利工程上，截至现在，人民和军队，已经完成了三亿五千万土方，如把它筑成一公尺宽一公尺高，可以在地球上绕赤道八遭还多。这个工程的效益，据各地区所提出的保证的总和，假如发生与去年同样的洪水，去年被淹地一亿亩中的七千万亩，可以保障免遭水患。不过这个保障，还有待于今年洪水的考验，不像救灾工作，粮食调运工作，都是已经完成了的。
    只就以上几件事，满足以说明：人民需要的事，政府一定做，政府决定要做的事，一定能做成。人民政府就是以这样的信心和在这样的基础上，制定计划，完成计划；人民意志也正是这样的经过人民政府，而集中表现出来。
    我们获得这样巨大的工作成绩，是和毛主席的领导，中国共产党的领导，中央人民政府政务院和各委员会的领导，分不开的。同样重要，要完成这样艰巨繁难的任务，如果没有政治水平和高度工作热情的地方党的领导，地方基层干部的贯彻执行，也是不能想像的。事实证明，正是由于我们地方基层干部，坚决执行政策，和顽强不屈的工作精神，带领群众，克服无数困难，才能完成这样难以想像的工作任务。根据我自己耳闻目见的事实，这些同志们的功绩，是应该无愧的受到人民的表扬。他们完成任务，通常总是不轻松的，任务很重而困难不少。他们常是靠着两条腿，不休止地去工作；他们在许多偏僻的乡村，不是营养很好而是营养很坏的去工作；他们不是避开太阳工作，而是顶着太阳工作；他们常常是下铺地，上盖天和蚊虫一块儿睡觉。但他们念念不忘的是执行政策，时刻在怀的是完成任务。执行政策，完成任务，无保留的为人民服务，就是他们所有的一切。他们的物质生活，已经很低了，很多同志，还是节省出自己的一些粮食或衣服，救济灾民。他们的工作任务，不是用签字在公文上去完成，而是在群众中用血和汗，用忘我的精神去完成。“任务”在他们已经是很平常的事了，但他们还得在一定时期内“任怨”。如水利工程，有时是这里动工，而其利在那里，上游动工而其利在下游。群众中落后的地域观念、本位思想没有完全克服以前，一部分怨言是不免的。运粮工作中，遭受一时的怀疑或抱怨，也是不免的。如果没有高度的政治认识和政策观点，要想完成任务，是不容易的。
    这就是我们新民主主义建设中，全新的基层工作干部的作风和面貌。
    有些人对于干部不无指责。我认为个别的偏差和缺点是有的，但这些偏差和缺点，有些是完成任务不可免的，有些是运用党内党外批评与自我批评，和不断的学习教育，完全可以克服的。至于犯法分子，人民政府是向不宽贷的。
    土地改革问题。我对于刘副主席的报告，和所提出的土地改革法，衷心表示拥护。我们依靠这些坚强的地方基层干部，来执行这样一个完善的土地改革法，就满有信心做到有领导的，有计划的，有秩序的土地改革。
    当然，土地改革这样一件巨大的革命工程，在实际执行过程中，是有困难的，有些人是要感觉痛苦的。因为这是阶级斗争，不是阶级调和。既然是革命，要改变财产关系，就不可避免的要有斗争，既然生疮，要开刀，就不能不感受相当痛苦。对于这些困难，我们有信心完全加以克服，有保障胜利的完成土改工作的任务。因为我们有毛主席的英明领导，有实事求是的中国共产党掌握政策，有我们此次会议所协商拟定的完善的土地改革法，又有任劳任怨，执行政策，完成任务的地方基层干部。这就可以使我们减少偏差，减少阻力，妥善的稳步的完成土地改革工作。
    八个月的工作中，中央人民政府在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下，获得了极其巨大的工作成绩，这是中央人民政府的光荣，当然也是政协全国委员会的光荣。
    摆在我们面前的任务，是争取财政经济状况的基本好转，而财政经济状况的基本好转，是以完成土地改革，发展农村生产力，和调整工商业为其基本前提。我们有信心克服一切困难，完成这个光荣的历史任务。
    让我们紧密的团结在毛主席和共产党的旗帜之下，为人民的长久幸福，和国家光明灿烂的前途，前进！
    我们高呼：
    光荣归于毛主席！幸福属于全体劳动人民！
