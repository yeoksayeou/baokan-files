    [This newspaper dispatch] This newspaper has received 30,124 peace signatures from various locations in the three days from June 8th to 10th.

Comrade Chen Chu, who lost both eyes in the revolutionary war, refused to let others sign on his behalf and wrote his name on the paper himself. He also wrote "Oppose the conspiracy to launch war!" The crooked but powerful handwriting is a javelin thrown at the warmongers. Comrade Liu Zhengming, who lost his right arm, wrote this vow with his left hand: "War has taken away my hand. I want to oppose war and support peace, but I am not afraid of war or seeking peace from imperialism. If the war traffickers dare to launch a new war, I will continue to fight to the end for the cause of world people's peace with my only left hand." The customer signature book mobilized by Beijing Lianying Bookstore was entrusted to this newspaper for forwarding. The total number of peace signatures received by this newspaper, including those previously received, has reached 540,893.
