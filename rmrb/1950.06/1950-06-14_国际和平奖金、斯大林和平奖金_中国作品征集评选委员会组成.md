Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: The preparatory committee for the recently established Chinese Works Solicitation and Evaluation Committee for International Peace Prizes and Stalin Peace Prizes held a meeting on the 8th, presided over by Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the First National Congress of Natural Science Workers of China. More than 20 representatives from four units attended: the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Preparatory Committee for the First National Congress of Natural Science Workers of China. At the meeting, Wu Yuzhang pointed out: The International Peace Prize solicitation campaign is a very important task in striving for international peace, and we must do this work well. He said: "The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War is a victory against the imperialists. It not only helped the national liberation movements of colonial countries, but also made a great contribution to the world peace movement. We should pay attention to these characteristics when selecting works." Then, Tian Han reported on the initiation process and methods of the Peace Prize. He pointed out: In order to strive for and consolidate lasting world peace, two types of peace prizes have been established in the past year: one is the International Peace Prize adopted by the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris and Prague last April. This prize is for films, literature, and art works that have made the most significant contributions to promoting peace among people worldwide. Each winner can receive five million francs (approximately 5,000 pounds). The evaluation method is that organizations from various countries representing the world peace movement first review the submitted works and conduct a preliminary selection, then submit them to a judging panel composed of eleven members of different nationalities for review and recommendation, and then the World Committee makes the final decision. All works must be submitted to the judging panel before January 1st each year, and only works published after 1945 are eligible for submission. Recently, the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council announced its decision to invite celebrities from all over the world to form a judging committee in order to award the Peace Prize in late August. China's submission for this year has expired, and preparations should be made early for next year. The other is the International Stalin Peace Prize, established by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the occasion of Stalin's 70th birthday, with five to ten prizes. Each prize includes a peace certificate, a gold medal with Stalin's portrait, and 100,000 rubles (approximately 7,000 pounds). This prize is awarded to individuals in any country who have made outstanding contributions to the cause of world peace, including painting, music, literature, film, architecture, sculpture, science, and applied science. These prizes will be awarded annually on Stalin's birthday starting in 1950. In China, the solicitation and evaluation of works for both peace prizes will be handled uniformly by the same organization.

The meeting then elected Wu Yuzhang, Shen Yanbing, and 28 others to form the Chinese Works Solicitation and Evaluation Committee for International Peace Prizes and Stalin Peace Prizes, actively launching this work.

　　国际和平奖金、斯大林和平奖金
    中国作品征集评选委员会组成
    【新华社十二日讯】最近成立之国际和平奖金、斯大林和平奖金中国作品征集评选委员会筹备委员会，八日在中华全国第一次自然科学工作者代表大会筹委会主任委员吴玉章主持下召开会议。出席者有中国保卫世界和平大会委员会，中苏友好协会总会，中华全国文学艺术界联合会，中华全国第一次自然科学工作者代表大会筹备委员会等四单位代表二十余人。会上吴玉章指出：国际和平奖金应征运动，是争取国际和平的一个非常重要的工作，我们必须作好这一工作。他说：“我们中国人民解放战争的胜利，就是反对帝国主义者的胜利。它不仅帮助了殖民地国家的民族解放运动，对保卫世界和平运动也有极大贡献。我们选择作品时应注意这些特点。”继由田汉报告和平奖金发起经过及办法。他指出：为了争取并巩固世界持久和平，一年来曾建立了两种和平奖金：一是去年四月巴黎、布拉格世界拥护和平大会通过的国际和平奖金。这奖金系为在全世界人民中推动和平最有贡献的电影、文学、艺术作品而设。每一得奖者可得五百万法郎（约五千英镑）。评选办法是先由代表世界和平运动的各国组织审查应征作品，实行初选，送交由不同国籍的十一个委员所组成的评判组审查推荐，然后由世界委员会作最后决定。一切作品要在每年一月一日前提交评判组，作品要一九四五年以后发表的才有应征资格。最近世界和大常委会执行局宣布决邀请世界各方名流组成评判委员会，以便在八月下旬颁发和平奖金。本年度中国应征已过期，来年度准备应早着手。一是斯大林七十寿诞前苏联最高苏维埃主席团决议设立的五名到十名国际斯大林和平奖金。每名有一和平奖状，斯大林肖像金奖章及十万卢布（约七千英镑）。此种奖金颁给任何国家中对世界和平事业有卓越功绩者，包括绘画、音乐、文学、电影、建筑、雕刻、科学和应用科学等。此等奖金从一九五○年起在每年斯大林诞生日颁给。在中国这两种和平奖金作品之征集与评定将由同一机构统一处理。
    会议接着推选吴玉章、沈雁冰等三十人，组成国际和平奖金、斯大林和平奖金中国作品征集评选委员会，积极展开这一工作。
