　　Yongyu County, Shanxi Province, Neglects Public Grain Storage
    Grain Bureau Should Conduct Strict Self-Criticism
    [Our Dispatch] Due to serious bureaucracy and disregard for the safekeeping of state property within the Yongyu County Grain Bureau in Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province, the county suffered a loss of 260,000 jin of public grain due to embezzlement and misappropriation.
    When transferring grain to Yuxiang County after the county was divided this year, it was discovered during the inventory that none of the 260,000+ jin of public grain stored in the county's Kaizhang Grain Depot remained. Further investigation revealed that all the grain had been embezzled and misappropriated by Feng Jingquan, the depot's storage director. This included over 13,800 jin of Central grain wheat, over 18,600 jin of bank wheat, over 120,500 jin of county local grain wheat, over 100,900 jin of civil affairs department's wartime service wheat, and a total of over 262,600 jin including village expenses temporarily stored grain from various villages. In addition to detaining Feng Jingquan, the county dispatched special personnel to conduct a thorough investigation.
    The investigation revealed that the fundamental reason was that the County Grain Bureau did not take the safekeeping of state public grain seriously, did not educate the grain depot management personnel, did not conduct in-depth inspections of the warehouses, and lacked a strict management system. Furthermore, the depot's use of public grain for government office production and other activities began as early as June 1948, with the direct support of district chief Wu Shimin, such as a district financial assistant borrowing 20 *shi* of wheat. However, the bureau did not handle this issue carefully, which emboldened the depot cadres to boldly and extensively borrow public grain. Moreover, the main culprit, Feng Jingquan, was from a merchant background with very backward thinking, yet the bureau did not examine his background and re-used him as the storage director, carelessly entrusting the grain contributed to the country by the people's year-round labor to such a speculative merchant with no concept of the state. Although inspections were conducted in the past, they were not in-depth, allowing the illegal misappropriation of 260,000 jin of grain to spread across twelve villages without being detected. Last August, the Songjiazhuo storage depot under the branch depot embezzled and misappropriated over 9,000 jin of wheat, but the County Grain Bureau did not take this as a serious warning. It was not until the director of the Jinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office went to Yongyu County for inspection in December of last year that the matter was discovered, and they were instructed to immediately handle it and report it, but the county magistrate also shelved it, and it had not been reported by the end of February of this year. Later, Yuncheng Prefecture specifically instructed in writing in late February to carry out this work and sent two cadres to assist, but the county still did not take it seriously. The County Government and Grain Bureau should immediately conduct a serious and thorough inspection of all grain depots in the county based on the spirit of the instructions from higher authorities and should conduct a strict self-criticism.

### 山西永虞县不重视公粮保管  粮食局应严格检讨

　　山西永虞县不重视公粮保管
    粮食局应严格检讨
    【本报讯】山西运城专区永虞县因粮食局存在着严重的官僚主义作风，漠视国家资财的保管，以致造成二十六万斤公粮被贪污挪用的损失。
    该县于今年划县后向虞乡县移交粮食时，在清点中始发觉该县开张粮库所存公粮二十六万余斤，竟无一粒现粮。经进一步调查了解，始知粮食悉数被该库支仓主任冯镜权贪污挪用尽净。其中计有中央粮麦子一三、八○○余斤，银行麦子一八、六○○余斤，县地方粮麦子一二○、五○○余斤，民政科战勤麦子一○○、九○○余斤，连同各村村经费暂存粮共计二六二、六○○余斤。该县除将冯镜权扣押外，同时派专人进行清理。
    经检查结果，基本原因是该县粮食局对国家公粮的保管工作根本不重视，对粮库管理人员不教育，对仓库不深入检查，更没有一套严格的管理制度。且该库动用公粮搞机关生产等，远在一九四八年六月在区长武世民直接支持下即已开始，如该区一财政助理员就挪借过麦子二十石。但该局对此问题根本未慎重处理，致使该库干部敢于大胆大量挪借公粮；再加以主犯冯镜权系商人出身，思想非常落后，而该局竟不加审查，重用为支仓主任，将人民常年劳动所得，贡献给国家的粮食，随便交与这样一个毫无国家观念的投机商人去管理。过去虽亦派员检查，但未深入了解，致使二十六万斤粮被非法挪用，范围遍及十二个村而尚无所闻。去年八月该支仓所属宋家卓保管库曾将九千余斤麦子贪污挪用，县粮食局亦未因此而引起重视和警惕，直至去年十二月晋南专署秘书主任前往永虞县检查工作时始发现，才责成即时处理具报，但该县县长对此亦置之高阁，到今年二月底尚未呈报。后运城专署于二月下旬又专文指示进行此项工作，并派干部二人协助，但该县依然未加重视。该县县府和粮食局应即根据上级指示精神，认真、彻底将全县所有粮库进行检查，并应进行严格的检讨。
