　　Berlin – Capital of the German Democratic Republic
　　By Krasnopolski, translated by Lin Yuyi
　　Following an unusually mild winter, spring arrived quickly in Berlin this year. The weather is beautiful and warm, and the old trees scarred by bombing and street fighting are sprouting buds. Parks and courtyards are crowded with children. Countless tour boat stations and small restaurants outside the city are being repaired and repainted. Berlin in the spring of 1950 is bustling and vibrant, with bright flags and slogans on the buildings of the German Democratic Republic government, and construction timber piled up on Unter den Linden.

　　The face of the German capital has changed a lot in the five years since the war. These years have not been easy. This is because the people's democratic creativity has generated the vitality to overcome difficulties. Wherever this creativity has not been suppressed by the Anglo-American occupation authorities, life is vigorously pulsating. The smoking chimneys of factories, the intense work in housing construction areas, and the streets crowded with busy people – this is the capital of the German Democratic Republic today.

　　Political activity has reached a climax. Preparations are now underway for the National Youth Congress scheduled for the end of May. Half a million young men and women are coming to Berlin from all over Germany to participate in this important political event, to express the determination of far-sighted German youth to defend peace, strive for the unification of the motherland, and be friendly with the progressive people of the world. These hundreds of thousands of young people will be guests of the residents of Berlin, but because the West Berlin police authorities have forbidden them to reside there, they will all have to live in East Berlin. Many Berliners have volunteered to host these young representatives from Thuringia, Bavaria, and Mecklenburg. But more accommodation is needed, so the Free German Youth League is sending members to ask people for help.

　　Here, a tall young man and a lively and clever girl are visiting an old barber, Hengqi. Mrs. Hengqi stares disapprovingly at the young man's feet: it's been raining outside, and she doesn't think he's cleaned his boots carefully enough. In short, she doesn't like any of this: it means a few extra days of trouble. Old Hengqi sees that his wife is about to lose her temper, so before she can open her mouth, he quickly says:

　　"We are happy to host four representatives, in fact, I think we can even find a place for five. Write down the address. We will do our best to make them comfortable," he smiles slightly.

　　"I'm cleaning and washing all day long," Mrs. Hengqi complains, "even during the war, I tried to keep everything tidy, and now you're letting this group of people in; they're likely to ruin half the furniture."

　　"Don't get excited," her husband says. "It's lucky that the house is still here. We might have been bombed more than ten times during the war, what does your cleaning and washing count for? Remember how scared you were in the air-raid shelter? You said that as long as those horrors could stop, you would be prepared to eat bread and drink plain water for the rest of your years. And now you're making a fuss because I'm going to host a few young people for a few days – tell you, young people are fighting to prevent another war, so that ordinary people like us can have a life worth living. Don't I have a lot of work now? And in the American occupation zone, my old friend Crowe hanged himself, because unemployment and the damn West German Mark made him lose his customers, and he had to close the shop he had been running for thirty years. Why don't you think about that?"

　　Mrs. Hengqi doesn't speak, and after thinking for a while, she says:

　　"I think we still have that old canvas bed and wicker chair in the attic, I'll go and see. We should see what those things look like, maybe they need repairing. You can't ask these young people to sleep on the floor."

　　The ancient, destroyed Berlin is being restored to order and improved. The city's largest and best stadium – the Olympia – is in the British zone, but the British authorities and their West Berlin municipal government puppets forbid the democratic youth of Berlin to use it. Therefore, the young people decided to build their own stadium. The new "Midd Stadium" will be a large-scale stadium, including the old ruins of several bombed barracks and a former parade ground, with a capacity of 70,000 people. This stadium is being built in the city center, bordering the French zone. Hundreds of young people are working there. This will be their gift to the capital. Groups are competing to achieve the best results. The people taking over shifts run to work with great enthusiasm, carrying the blue Free German Youth League flag, playing the accordion, and singing songs.

　　In another part of the city, on the Huheide grassland, a "Young Pioneers Republic" is being built for children. There will be a clubhouse, a library, a sports field, a playground, a swimming pool, a small railway managed by the young people themselves, and many other facilities for recreation.

　　Democratic youth play an important role in Berlin. In many factories, it is the youth who have launched the production activist movement.

　　In political life, young people are also at the forefront. For example, let me describe a youth gathering held that day at the corner of Bruns Street and Burnas Street, at the border between the Soviet and French zones. This gathering was convened to protest the mass arrests of democratic youth in West Berlin. Several hours before the meeting, the West German police set up a tight defense line at the junction of the two occupation zones, and a team of about four hundred policemen riding motorcycles was also present: West Berliners were prevented from participating in this gathering.

　　At five o'clock in the afternoon, two processions appeared: one was the Free German Youth League procession, and the other was the youth organization of the Social Democratic Party – the Eagle League, or rather, the part of the Eagle League that supports cooperation with the democrats. Amidst slogans of "intimate friendship," the two teams mixed together, and right in front of the police, they planted flags on the boundary line of the occupation zones, and hundreds of leaflets flew over the heads of the police to the French zone.

　　One of the speakers was a young Social Democratic journalist from Westphalia. He was sent to Berlin by his editors to collect materials on the "oppression" of Social Democrats in the Soviet occupation zone. But only after staying in Berlin for a day or two, and happened to participate in an anti-war demonstration in Charlottenburg in the British occupation zone, he was beaten by Stam's police; it was some Free German Youth League members who helped him up and sent him to the hospital.

　　"Therefore, I myself discovered which side is the camp of freedom and which side is the camp of oppression," he concluded to enthusiastic applause, "I joined the Free German Youth League and want to make it my own business to report the truth about Berlin to the people of my hometown in the Ruhr area."

　　At the end of the meeting, the police line cracked open and allowed a group of fascist thugs to rush over, who threw stones at the dispersing demonstrators and chased them with wooden sticks and iron bars.

　　In West Berlin, this kind of thing is very common, there are countless organized fascist party members. These organizations are established by the American authorities according to the Nazi model, centered on the so-called American Youth Club, in which degenerate, unemployed youth are trained as secret agents, saboteurs, and political hooligans, and they are also supplied with prostitutes for the American military officers. In every street conflict or accident, this group of well-dressed, well-fed playboys who frequent these clubs always participate. Some of them wander around in the black shorts and boots of the Nazi stormtroopers, some like to show off on the streets in American military pants, and others still like to wear brightly colored plaid shirts, much longer coats, and narrow-legged pants. But they all have long hair – this is the most fashionable style of the turtle. These thugs attack anti-fascists under the protection of Stam's police, beat them, and drag them to the police station.

　　This time, the fascist bandits' attempt to disrupt the situation did not materialize. They were driven back to the French zone. Stam's police rushed to help and beat them with batons. The democratic youth and the workers who rushed to help from the surrounding streets showed a high degree of calm and restraint. Thousands of young men and women lined up in a strong human wall facing the police at the junction of the two districts. At that moment, a truck carrying the Free German Youth League trumpeter appeared there, the bugle sounded, and thousands of people sang "The Song of Democratic Youth." The song floated over the heads of the police and into the gloomy streets of the French zone.

　　★　　　★　　　★

　　In West Berlin, all democratic organizations – political, civic, and cultural – are suffering cruel persecution. Just being seen reading a newspaper published in the East Zone in the subway or on a park bench will get you sent to the police station. Selling any publications of the German Democratic Republic – even German classics – is strictly prohibited, and many news vendors have already been detained for distributing democratic newspapers and magazines.

　　But, despite all this, the democrats of Berlin, especially the democratic youth, are fearlessly fighting for peace, for German unity, and for friendship with the Soviet Union in words and deeds. Progressive newspapers, prints, and pamphlets have found many readers. Democratic slogans and leaflets often appear on the walls. The English slogan "Go Home," is written in chalk on buildings housing Anglo-American agencies, on barracks walls, and sometimes even on military trucks. Although the West German authorities have recently banned all gatherings of democratic organizations, gatherings are still being held – the young Social Democrat who came from the Ruhr to see how the Communists "oppress the Social Democrats" was beaten by the police at one of these gatherings.

　　Of course, some people in West Berlin enjoy freedom of action. For example, a branch of the West German Justice Party was recently established here. The hall is decorated with the black, white, and red colors of the Wilhelm Empire. An old gentleman, with distinguished military emblems and stylishly curled beard, gave a speech praising the German Emperor. In his opinion: Emperor Wilhelm only made one big mistake, that is, he was too gentle and compliant. In West Berlin, along with this kind of political organization, there are also spy and profiteer agencies and a large number of "clubs," "federations," and "associations" of suspicious nature.

　　In the effort to maintain West Berlin as a hotbed of espionage, sabotage, and fascist propaganda in the center of the German Democratic Republic, the Americans and British are not opposed to any waste. Subsidies flow generously into the West Berlin municipal government, the city bank, and the yellow unions, and also into the pockets of their leaders. The Berlin Western puppet municipal government, in the eighteen months of its existence, has managed to spend 1.5 billion West German marks from donations and loans outside of the normal budget funds. Now, under the instructions of the American authorities, it receives large subsidies from the West German budget every month. But despite this, it is still unable to make ends meet. Municipal employees can only receive their salaries after long delays, and those who receive pensions and unemployment benefits have to wait for weeks to get their money, and the number of qualified recipients is reduced every month by various illegal means.

　　The financial situation of the puppet municipal government is very bad. But "Mayor" Luther and his colleagues are enriching themselves, as are the scores of people who manipulate commerce connected with them. Particularly rich profits fall into the hands of the owners of the fifty-four currency exchange bureaus. This forms a regular monopoly business supported by American merchants. Through American radio in Berlin and some subsidized West Berlin newspapers, they spread rumors to cause panic in the money market, and enable them to seize millions of dollars from the easily deceived masses. The latest panic of this type was created last month. It hit craftsmen, clerks, and small and medium-sized merchants hard. The resentment against the currency exchange bandits has reached such a degree that they fear their exchange agencies will be attacked. Official warnings appeared in the newspapers, emphasizing that currency exchange agencies are completely legal institutions and enjoy the protection of the authorities. But Berliners at the time didn't need to be told this was the case. Double-posted patrol police officers were on duty day and night outside the exchange agencies.

　　It is not surprising that the economic situation in West Berlin is unfortunate, due to its unnatural isolation from the German Democratic Republic, and the terrible plunder of its public funds.

　　A very significant sign is its number of more than 300,000 unemployed – more than in the worst months of the economic crisis in 1932. When the West German Mark began to be issued in mid-1948, the number of unemployed was only 40,000, and after the harsh rule of the Anglo-American authorities and their puppet Luther, the number of unemployed has increased almost eightfold.

　　Of these 300,000 unemployed, only 100,000 receive relief. Two-thirds of the unemployed and their families are doomed to starve. The situation of most craftsmen is equally miserable. Suicides by shoemakers, tailors, and barbers are common occurrences. Small and medium-sized enterprises are closing down one after another.

　　But, although the workers of West Berlin live in the shadow of unemployment, poverty, espionage, sabotage, and the rampant hooligans, the fashionable nightclubs and similar places of entertainment are crowded with idlers looking for pleasure. Fortune tellers, soothsayers, and other street performers are taking advantage of people's anxiety to do their business. Some fortune-telling magazines sell better than any West German newspaper, and people who want to have their fortune told by the "clairvoyant" Mrs. Kodoss have to register months in advance; thousands of people often line up on the small street where she lives, so that the police finally have to intervene. Unexpectedly, this woman has been issued a license by the municipal government.

　　★　　　★　　　★

　　Just a short distance away – sometimes just across a street, where housewives used to chat with their neighbors across the street, and shop assistants used to spend their time crossing the narrow road – a completely different world, a world of labor and striving to create, is growing up. The scars of war in East Berlin are still new, and there are still many places that need to be rebuilt. But the most difficult days are over. Everyone realizes this. Workers have enough food and clothing, and they don't freeze in the winter. If their houses are damaged, they are now being repaired. Most importantly, there is hope for the future, and a sense of security for tomorrow, which is so obviously lacking in West Berlin. There are no unemployed people in the eastern region. On the contrary, the newspapers are full of "job recruitment" advertisements: workers, engineers, medical personnel, and all kinds of professionals are needed. More than 100,000 Berliners from the western district have found work in the eastern district, and this number would be even greater if the western district authorities did not suppress those who dare to accept jobs in East Berlin.

　　The municipal economic and financial situation of East Berlin is proof of this. When the new democratic municipal government took over the regime from the reactionary saboteurs who fled to the western district on November 30, 1948, the city treasury was empty, the municipal economy was out of sync, and the municipal government was a bureaucratic organization full of superfluous personnel. It seemed that there was no hope. However, after a short period of time, great achievements were made. Not only was the financial budget balanced without subsidies and donations, but most of the budget was also used to build houses. This is also the first time in Berlin's history that the municipal government has made large investments in industry.

　　At the beginning of last year, East Berlin's industry began production for the first time according to a unified economic plan. Even though the reactionaries fiercely resisted and openly sabotaged, the plan was exceeded. The reason why this became possible is largely due to the establishment of the new democratic municipal government, and the fact that Berlin's economy, in the form of state-owned enterprises, is its stable foundation. While the main factories in the western district remain in the hands of monopoly enterprises, 465 large and medium-sized enterprises in East Berlin have been handed over to the people, which has provided a solid foundation for developing the economy along the democratic line.

　　The results were quickly shown. In 1949, the output of state-owned enterprises exceeded that of 1948 by 60 percent. The financial situation has also improved. The West Berlin government overspends 70 to 80 million marks per month, while the result of the democratic government's fiscal year is that revenue exceeds expenditure.

　　The matter of building houses is being addressed with the greatest care, and whole rows of houses are being rebuilt. Among the six major construction plans, the construction of streets including a large number of standard apartment houses is given the greatest attention, and these houses are being rebuilt one after another. This is the first time since the war that construction work has been carried out on such a large scale, and machines are also used. This year, the municipal government has begun a large, new worker housing project near Stalin Road.

　　When Albert presented the 1950 plan to the municipal government, he pointed out that the speed of progress will now increase greatly compared to the past.

　　The investment figure under this plan is 400 million marks, and the appropriation for building houses is 80 percent more than last year. And in April, it can already be safely said that the planned investment figure will be exceeded.

　　Of course, all this is not produced by itself. It is the achievement of the vibrant people, the working people. The spirit of Berliners, especially Berlin workers, has undergone a huge transformation. Now the workers know that their labor helps to rebuild the economic life, and helps to reduce prices. And the various democratic organizations, led by the Socialist Unity Party, have made a great contribution to establishing this understanding among the workers. The Socialist Unity Party has successfully transferred the center of its mass activities to factories, which is a major achievement. The Socialist Unity Party is a true working-class party, a working-people's party, and their vanguard.

　　In these big and small things, we can see that people's thoughts and actions are beginning to be dominated by new feelings and new consciousness. Workers are increasingly proving that they will defend the rights they have obtained and resist the encroachment of Anglo-American reactionaries.

　　There is a remarkable example. The American authorities and their German pawns have long wanted to usurp control of the electric railway that runs through the western district. They tried to do so, but failed repeatedly, so they decided to use destructive methods. The sabotage groups established by the American authorities systematically damaged and removed wires, insulators, and other equipment. It was by no means easy to fight against this kind of sabotage, because the western police condoned it. This situation did not stop until the railway workers organized their own self-defense teams outside the regular railway police. This proved to be very effective, and the situation of sabotage or removal of equipment was greatly reduced. How much sabotage in the factories has been stopped due to the vigilance of the workers!

　　Ordinary German men and women are being tempered into steel in the struggle against the enemies of their country and against all kinds of Americanized reactionaries. Berlin is their city, the capital of a new, democratic Germany.

　　Berlin, April 1950

　　柏林——民主德国的首都
    克拉斯诺波尔斯基  著  林玉仪  译
    紧随着一个不平常的温和的冬天，今年柏林的春天很快到来。天气是美好而温暖的，带着轰炸和巷战的疮疤的老树正在长出叶芽儿来。公园和庭院里挤满了小孩。无数的游船站和城外的小菜馆正在赶着修理并刷上新漆。一九五○年春天的柏林，大街上是匆忙而生气勃勃的，德意志民主共和国政府的大厦上有着鲜明的旗帜和标语，菩提树大街上堆满了建筑木材。
    战后五年以来德国首都的面貌已改变了很多。这些年头并不是轻易度过的。那是因为人民的民主的创造性产生了克服困难的活力。凡是这种创造性没有被英美占领当局所压制的地方生命就有力地在跃动着。工厂冒烟的烟囱，造屋区紧张的工作，挤满了忙碌的人群的街道——这就是今日的德意志民主共和国首都。
    政治活动达到了高潮。现在正在准备订于五月底举行的全国青年大会。五十万青年男女正从德国各地到柏林来参加这个重要的政治事件，来表示有远见的德国青年为保卫和平、争取祖国统一、以及与全世界进步人类友好相处的决心。这数十万青年将成为柏林居民的宾客，但是因为西柏林警察当局禁止他们在那边居留，他们将不得不全部住在柏林东区。许多柏林人自动报效招待这些来自杜林吉亚、巴伐利亚、麦克伦堡的青年代表。但是还需要更多的住所，所以自由德国青年联盟正派出盟员去请求人们帮助。
    这儿是一个高高的青年和一个活泼而伶俐的女孩子来访问一个老理发匠恒琪。恒琪太太嫌恶地注视着那青年的一双脚：外面老在下雨，她认为他没有很细心地去擦净他的靴子。总之，她就不喜欢这一切：这意味着要有几天额外的麻烦。老恒琪看出他的妻子快要发脾气了，所以她还没来及张嘴，他就很快地说：
    “我们很高兴来招待四个代表，实际上我想我们甚至能找到五个人住的地方。记下地址吧。我们将尽力使他们舒服，”他微微地笑了笑。
    “我整天在打扫洗刷，”恒琪太太抱怨说，“甚至在战争时期我也尽量使每件东西都很整齐，现在你却让这一群人进来；他们很可能会毁掉一半家具。”
    “不要激动，”她的丈夫说。“这房子还在，总算是一个幸运的事吧。在战时我们也许会被炸十次以上的，你的打扫洗刷算什么呢？还记得在防空壕里时你是多么害怕吗？你说过只要那些恐怖能够停止，你准备吃面包喝白水来度过余年。而现在因为我要招待几个青年人来住几天你就吵扰不休——告诉你，青年人正在防止另一次战争而斗争着，使像我们这样的小百姓可以有一个值得活的生活。现在我不是常有很多的工作吗？而在美国占领区那边，我的老友克劳上吊死了，由于失业和该死的西德马克使他失去了他的顾客，他不得不关闭了已经经营三十年的店铺。你为什么不想想这个呢？”
    恒琪太太不说话了，想了一会以后她说：
    “我想我们还有那个旧帆布床和柳条睡椅存在阁楼上，我要上去看看。我们该看看那些东西什么样子了，也许要修理一下。你总不能叫这些青年人睡在地板上呀。”
    古老的、被破坏了的柏林正在恢复秩序，并且有了改进。这城市的最大和最好的运动场——奥林匹亚——是在英占区，而英国当局及其西柏林市政府的傀儡禁止柏林的民主青年使用它。因此青年们便决定建造他们自己的运动场。新的“米德运动场”将是一个规模宏大的运动场，包括若干被炸毁的营房的旧墟和一个过去的练兵场，可容七万人。这运动场建筑在市中心，与法占区毗界的地方。几百青年人正在那里工作。这将是他们献给首都的礼物。各小组竞相做出最好的成绩。换班轮替工作的人带着蓝色的自由德国青年联盟的旗帜，奏着手风琴唱着歌，以高度的热情跑来工作。
    在城市的另一部分，在胡海德草地上，正在为儿童们建筑一个“青年先锋共和国”。这里将要有一个俱乐部，一个图书馆，运动场，游戏场，一个游泳池，一条由青年人自己管理的小铁路以及许多供休憩用的其他设备。
    民主青年在柏林担任着重要的角色。在许多工厂里是青年们发动了生产积极分子运动。
    在政治生活方面，青年们也位居前列。举例说，让我来描述那天在布伦斯街和布纳斯街拐角，即苏占区与法占区交界地方举行的一个青年人的集会吧。这个集会是为了抗议西柏林成批逮捕民主青年而召开的。开会前数小时，西德警察在两个占区的交界处布置起了一条紧密的防线，一队约四百多个驾着摩托车的警察亦在场：西柏林人是被阻止参加这一集会的。
    下午五点钟，两个游行队伍出现了：一个是自由德国青年联盟的队伍，另一个是社会民主党的青年组织——鹰团，或者说是鹰团中拥护与民主分子合作的那一部分人的队伍。在“亲密友好”的口号声中，这两支队伍混合在一起了，就在警察面前，他们把旗子插在占领区的界线上，成百张传单越过警察的头顶飞到法占区去。
    讲演人中有一个是来自威斯特发里亚的社会民主党的青年记者。他是被他的编辑先生们派来柏林搜集苏占区“压迫”社会民主党人的材料的。但仅只在柏林耽了一两天，碰巧参加了一次英占区沙罗腾堡的反战示威游行，他却被斯达姆的警察打了一顿；还是几个自由德国青年联盟的盟员把他扶起来并且送他到医院去的。
    “因此我自己发现了那一边是自由的阵营，那一边是压迫的阵营，”在热烈的掌声中他这样地结束说，“我加入了自由德国青年联盟，并欲把向鲁尔区家乡人民报导柏林的真象当作我自己的事业”。
    在大会结束时，警察的防线裂开了让一群法西斯暴徒冲过来，他们以石块投掷散开的示威者并用木棍和铁棒追打他们。
    在西柏林，这种事情是很普通的，那里有无数有组织的法西斯党徒。这些组织是由美国当局按照纳粹的模型建立起来的，以所谓美国青年俱乐部为中心，在这些俱乐部中，堕落、失业的青年被训练为特务、破坏分子和政治流氓，它们并且以妓女供给美国的军官老爷们。在每一次街上的冲突或事故中，这班经常出入这些俱乐部的穿着时髦衣服、饱食终日的纨裤子弟总是参加了一手的。他们中有的穿着纳粹的冲锋队的黑短裤和长靴子到处浪荡，有的喜欢穿着美国军裤在街头炫示，另有一些却仍然喜欢穿着鲜艳夺目的格子布衬衫，较普通长得多的外衣和裤管窄小的裤子。但他们都留着长头发——这是乌龟最时髦的式样。这些暴徒们在斯达姆警察的庇护下攻击反法西斯者，殴打他们，并把他们拖到警察局去。
    这一次法西斯匪徒捣乱的企图没有实现。他们被赶回法占区去。斯达姆的警察赶来援助，用指挥棒打他们。民主青年们和从周围街道上匆忙跑来援助的工人表现出高度的冷静与自制。几千青年男女在两区交界处排列成一堵坚强的人墙面对着警察。正在那时，一辆载着自由德国青年联盟的喇叭手的卡车在那儿出现了，号声响起了，成千的人唱起《民主青年之歌》。歌声飘过警察的头顶，传入了法占区阴郁的小街。
    ★      ★      ★
    在西柏林，所有的民主组织——政治的、市民的和文化的——都遭受着残忍的迫害。仅仅因为被看见在地下火车里或公园凳子上阅读了东区出版的报纸，就会被送入警察局。出售德意志民主共和国的任何出版物——甚至德国古典作品——是被严格禁止的，并且有许多卖报小贩因为送发民主报纸和杂志已经被拘禁起来。
    但是，不管这一切，柏林的民主分子，尤其是民主青年，他们以语言和事实，为和平、为德国统一、为对苏友好而毫不畏惧地战斗着。进步的报纸、印刷品和小册子找到了很多读者。民主的标语和传单经常在墙上出现。英文的“滚回家去”的标语，用粉笔写在驻有英美机关的建筑上，兵营墙上，有时甚至在军用卡车上。虽然最近西德当局已经禁止了所有民主组织的集会，可是集会仍在举行——那个从鲁尔来看共产党怎样“压迫社会民主党”的年轻的社会民主党员，便是在这样的一次集会上，被警察打了一顿的。
    当然啦，有些人在西柏林是享受到行动自由的。例如，最近在这儿成立了一个西德正义党的支部。大厅以威廉帝国的黑、白、红三色为装饰。一位年老的、佩有显赫的军事纹章、时髦地卷曲着胡子的绅士发表了一篇赞美德国皇帝的演说。按他的意见：德皇威廉只犯过一个大的错误，就是他过于温和而顺从了。在西柏林，和这种政治组织一起，那里还充斥着奸细和奸商的机关以及性质可疑的大批“俱乐部”、“联合会”和“协会”等。
    在保持西柏林作为在德意志民主共和国中心的一个间谍、破坏和法西斯宣传的温床的努力中，美国人和英国人是不反对什么浪费的。津贴慷慨地流入西柏林市政府，市银行和黄色工会，并且也流入它们的领导者的腰包中。柏林西部伪市政府，在它存在的这十八个月中，设法在正常预算基金之外耗费了从赠与和借贷得到的十五亿西德马克。现在由于得到了美国当局的指令，它每月从西德预算获得大量津贴。但是尽管如此，它还是不能够收支相抵。市政职工只有经过长时延搁之后才能领到薪水，领取养老金和失业救济金的人要等候几星期才领到钱，而合格领款的人数每月却被用各种非法的手段减少着。
    伪市政府的财政情况很坏。但是“市长”路德和他的同僚却营私自肥，而与他们有联系的成打的操纵商业的人们也是如此。特别丰厚的利润落入五十四个货币兑换局所有者的手中。这就形成了一个背后有美国商人支持的正规的独占商业。通过在柏林的美国无线电和一些接受津贴的西柏林报纸，他们散布谣言以引起货币市场恐慌，并使他们能从易于受骗的群众那儿夺取百万资财。最近一次的这种类型的恐慌，是在上月制造出来的。它重重地打击了手工业者、职员和中小商人。对兑换货币的匪徒的愤恨达到了这样的程度，以致他们害怕他们的兑换机关会受到袭击。官方的警告出现在报纸上，强调货币兑换机关完全是合法的机构，享受当局的保护。但是当时的柏林人用不着人告诉就知道这是事实。双岗的巡逻警察日夜在兑换机关门外值班。
    正由于西柏林与德意志民主共和国的不自然的隔离，以及它的公共资金受到可怕的掠夺，对于它的经济情况的不幸就不必感到惊异了。
    非常显著的征象是它的三十万以上的失业者的数目——比一九三二年经济危机时期最坏的月份还要多。当一九四八年年中西德马克开始发行时，失业人数只有四万人，经过英美当局和他们的傀儡路德的苛政统治，失业者数目差不多增加了八倍。
    在这三十万失业者当中，只有十万人得到救济。三分之二的无业者及他们的家庭是注定要挨饿了。大部分手工业者的情况也同样悲惨。鞋匠、成衣匠和理发匠自杀，是寻常的事情。中小企业接连地倒闭。
    但是，虽然西柏林的工人生活在失业、贫困、特务、捣乱和流氓猖獗的阴影中，时髦的夜总会和类似的娱乐场却挤满着找寻快乐的懒汉。卖卜者、算命者和其他走江湖的人利用人们不安的心情大做他们的买卖。某些刊印算命的杂志比任何西德报纸的销路还要好些，去“千里眼”科多斯夫人那里占命的人几个月前就要登记；成千的人经常在她住的那条小街上排列成行，使得警察最后不得不过问一下。意外的是，这个妇人已从市政府领到了一张执照。
     ★     ★     ★
    仅仅在相隔不远之处——有时只要跨过一条街，那儿主妇们惯于同她们的邻居隔街聊天，店员们惯于跨过狭窄的马路消磨他们的时辰——一个完全两样的世界，一个劳动的和努力创造的世界成长起来了。东部柏林的战争创伤犹新，还有许多地方需要重建。但最艰苦的时日已经过去了。每个人都意识到这一点。工人的衣食是充足的，冬天不致受冻。假如他的房屋损坏了，现在正在补修呢。最重要的，是对前途有希望，对明日有安全感，而这个是在西部柏林所如此显然缺少的。在东部地区没有失业的人。相反地，报纸上充满了“招工”的广告：需要工人、工程师、医务人员及各类职业者。从西区来的十多万的柏林人在东区找到了工作，如果不是西区当局对敢于接受东柏林的职业的人加以镇压的话，这个数字会要更大。
    东柏林的市政经济和财政状况就是一个证明。当一九四八年十一月三十日新的民主市政府接替了那些逃往西区的反动破坏者的政权时，市库是空空的，市政经济脱节了，市政府是一个冗员充斥的官僚机构。看来事情是没有希望的了。然而经过一个短时期之后，却有了很大的成就。不仅是无需补助和捐款，财政预算就平衡了，而且预算的大部分还用来修建房屋。这也是柏林历史上第一次市政府在工业上有了很大投资。
    去年年初，东柏林的工业第一次根据一个统盘的经济计划而开始生产。纵然反动分子猛烈对抗与公开破坏，计划还是被超过了。这一点之所以成为可能，大部系由于新的民主市政府之成立，柏林的经济，以公营企业形式为其稳定的基础。当西区的主要工厂还留在独占企业的手里时，东柏林却有四百六十五家大中企业已经交予给人民，这就使沿着民主路线发展经济有了一个坚固的基础。
    事情的结果很快就显示出来了。一九四九年国营企业的生产量超过一九四八年百分之六十。财政方面的情况亦已改善。西柏林政府每月超支七千至八千万马克，而民主政府这财政年度的结果却是岁入超过支出。
    造房子的事情被最关心地解决着，整排整排的房子正在重新建筑。在六个主要的建设计划里，建造包括有大批标准式的公寓房子的街道被付以最大注意，而这些房子正在接一连二地重建着。这是自战争以来，建筑工程第一次在如此大规模地进行，而且还使用了机器。今年，市政府已开始在斯大林路附近，进行一个大的、新的工人住宅的计划。
    艾伯特在向市政府提呈一九五○年计划时指出，现在进步的速度将比以往大有增加。
    在该计划下的投资数字是四亿马克，建筑房屋的拨款较去年增多百分之八十。而在四月份，已经能保险地说，计划中的投资数字是会被超过的。
    当然，所有这一切并非是自己产生的。它是有活力的人民，劳动人民的成就。柏林人，特别是柏林工人的精神已有了巨大转变。现在工人知道他的劳动有助于重建经济生活，有助于减低物价。而以统一社会党为首的各个民主组织，对建立工人的这种理解，有莫大的贡献。统一社会党胜利地将它群众活动的中心转移至工厂，这是一个主要的成就。统一社会党是一个真正工人阶级政党，一个劳动人民政党，是他们的先锋队。
    在这样大大小小的事情里，我们可以看出人们的思想与行动是在开始被新的感情与新的意识支配着。工人们越来越证明他们将保卫他们已得的权利，反对英美反动分子的侵害。
    有一个显著的例子。美国当局及其德国爪牙久欲篡夺穿越西区的电气铁道的控制权。他们试图这样做，但屡次都失败了，因而他们决定用破坏的办法。由美国当局建立的破坏集团有组织地损毁与拆除电线、绝缘器及其他设备。与这种破坏行为作斗争决非易事，因西部警察纵容它。这种情形一直到铁路工人在正规的铁路警察之外组织起自己的自卫队时方才停止。这证明是非常有效的，破坏或搬除设备的情形大大减少了。工厂里的破坏有多少是曾经由于工人的警戒而加以制止呵！
    德国普通男女正在反对他们国家的敌人、反对各种各样的美国化的反动分子的斗争中，锻炼成钢。柏林是他们的城市，一个新的、民主的德国的首都。
