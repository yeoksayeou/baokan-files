Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 11th: The Ningxia Province held a general education administrative conference in late May, deciding to establish Hui primary schools in areas where the Hui people live in concentrated communities, appropriately allocate Hui principals and teachers, and add Arabic courses. Since liberation, the province has not only restored 13 former Hui primary schools and the middle and primary schools in Alxa League, but also newly established two primary schools in Yinchuan City. These schools have all added Arabic courses. However, the administrative personnel in some individual areas did not pay enough attention to the education work of ethnic minorities, which caused dissatisfaction among some Hui people. After the administrative leading organs discovered this, it was promptly corrected.

　　宁夏举行教育会议
    决定增设回民学校
    【新华社西安十一日电】宁夏省五月下旬举行的普通教育行政会议，决定今后在回族人民聚居地区，设立回民小学，适当配备回民校长、教员，并增设阿拉伯文课程。该省自解放以来，除已恢复过去回民小学十三所和阿拉善旗的中、小学外，并在银川市新设小学二所。这些学校都增设了阿文课程。但也有个别地区的行政人员对少数民族的教育工作，不够重视，曾引起一部分回族人民的不满，后经过行政领导机关发现，都得到了及时的纠正。
