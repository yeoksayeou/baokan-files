The September 3rd Society Issues Statement:
	Chinese People Firmly Believe They Can Drive the American Imperialists Out of Taiwan
[This newspaper report] (By this paper) The September 3rd Society issued a statement on the 29th of this month, denouncing Truman's preposterous declaration of plotting to launch a world war and armed aggression against Chinese territory. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	On June 27th, U.S. President Truman, disregarding the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations that Taiwan should be returned to China, went so far as to order MacArthur to dispatch naval and air forces to support the South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet clique, which had initiated the offensive and was collapsing under the counterattack of North Korea. At the same time, he also ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the Pacific to assist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in obstructing the Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan. Regarding Truman's preposterous statement, our Foreign Minister Zhou issued a statement on the 28th of this month to refute it, which the members of this society warmly support.

	Since the strength of the world's democratic and peace-loving camp has grown day by day, the American imperialists, as the last bastion of capitalist imperialism, have completely torn off their past masks of "democracy and freedom" and "respect for the territorial sovereignty of other countries" throughout the world. This does not show its stubbornness, but rather indicates its death throes as it approaches its end. We firmly believe that the broad masses of the Chinese people were able to drive the American imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek out of mainland China in the past, and now we are 100% sure that we can drive the American imperialists and their running dogs out of Taiwan again. This kind of intimidation by the American imperialists not only fails to threaten the Chinese people, but on the contrary, it has aroused the anger of the broad masses of the Chinese people and accelerated the timetable for the liberation of Taiwan. We should thank the warmonger Truman for once again exposing the hideous face of American imperialist aggression, giving the Chinese people another lesson in "Imperialism."

	The affairs of Asian countries are matters for the people of Asian countries to handle themselves with full authority. What business is it of you, American imperialists? The affairs of China are matters for the Chinese people to handle themselves with full authority. What business is it of you, Truman? The American imperialists, who are singing the praises of the American Century, should look at the fate of your fascist predecessors Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo! People all over the world who are unwilling to be slaves, unite and treat this new warmonger Truman with the same determination and strength that you used to deal with the Hitlers of the past.

### 九三学社发表声明称：中国人民坚决相信能把美帝逐出台湾

　　九三学社发表声明称：
    中国人民坚决相信能把美帝逐出台湾
    【本报讯】九三学社于本月二十九日发表声明，斥杜鲁门阴谋发动世界战争武装侵略中国领土的狂妄声明。声明全文如下：
    六月二十七日美总统杜鲁门不顾开罗与波茨坦宣言台湾应归还中国的规定，竟疯狂的于命令麦克阿瑟派遣海空军支持首先发动进攻而在北朝鲜反攻下陷于崩溃状况的南朝鲜李承晚傀儡集团的同时，又命令美驻太平洋第七舰队协助蒋匪帮阻碍中国人民解放军解放台湾。对于杜鲁门这种狂妄声明，我周外长已于本月二十八日发表声明，予以驳斥，本社同人表示热烈的拥护。
    自从世界民主和平阵营的力量日渐壮大以来，作为资本帝国主义最后堡垒的美帝，即在全世界范围内把过去的“民主自由”与“尊重他国领土主权”等等假面具完全撕碎了，这并不显示它的倔强，而是表示它接近末日的垂死挣扎。我们坚决相信，中国广大人民过去既能把美帝及其走狗蒋介石赶出中国大陆，现在更百分之百的相信，是能够再把美帝及其走狗逐出台湾的。美帝这种虚声恫吓，不惟威胁不了中国人民，相反，它激起了广大的中国人民的愤怒，加速了解放台湾的日程。我们应该感谢战争贩子杜鲁门，再一次的把美帝侵略的狰狞面目，赤裸裸地暴露出来，给中国人民又上了一课“帝国主义论”。
    亚洲各国的事，亚洲各国人民有充分的权力自己来处理，干你美帝何事？中国的事，中国人民有充分权力自己来处理，干你杜鲁门何事？高唱美洲世纪的美帝，看看你的法西斯前辈希特勒，墨索里尼与东条的前路罢！全世界不甘做奴隶的人们，团结起来，拿过去对付希特勒们一样的决心和力量，来对待今天这个新的战争贩子杜鲁门。
