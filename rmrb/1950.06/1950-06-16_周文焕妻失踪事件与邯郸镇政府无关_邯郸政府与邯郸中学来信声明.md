Zhou Wenhuan's Wife's Disappearance Unrelated to Handan Town Government
Statements from Handan Government and Handan Middle School

I. Letter from Handan Town People's Government to the Editor:
Regarding the article "Revolutionary Soldier's Family Member Remarries, Second Field Army's Zhou Wenhuan Protests in a Letter" published in the People's Forum on May 18th, it does not align with the facts (please refer to the letter from Handan Middle School for the actual course of events). Based on our investigation, the facts are as follows:

First, on November 7th of last year, we received an official letter from the Political Department of the First Detachment of the North China Military and Political University. This year in January, we received a letter from Comrade Zhou Wenjie (Comrade Zhou Wenhuan's elder brother) inquiring about the marriage of Comrade Zhou Wenhuan's wife, Li Xianmei, to another person. The letters were brief and did not specify where Li Xianmei was from or where she was in Handan. We inquired with the Judicial Section and the Civil Affairs Section, but neither knew about Li Xianmei's marriage to another person. Therefore, it was not until February that the Judicial Section replied, stating "We are unaware of a person named Li Xianmei," and requested that they provide us with detailed information about Li Xianmei so that we could continue the investigation, it was not a matter of ignoring it.

Second, after the People's Forum published Comrade Zhou Wenhuan's letter, we immediately investigated with the responsible comrades of Handan Middle School. The actual course of events is as stated in the Handan Middle School's reply. As for the claim that Li Xianmei was "seized by a cadre of the Handan Municipal Government with significant responsibility through fabricated rumors and deception," it is entirely untrue. Among the current cadres and those who have already gone north or south, no such incident has been heard of. Comrade Zhou Wenhuan's statement is likely a misunderstanding based on hearsay.

In conclusion, where Li Xianmei has gone is still unclear. It is a fact that Li Xianmei did not marry a government cadre with government approval. Since Comrade Zhou Wenhuan's wife, Li Xianmei, studied at Handan Middle School, we have a responsibility to investigate this matter. Once we have any information, we will notify you by letter.

II. Excerpts from a Letter from Handan Middle School to the Editor:

Regarding the issue of Comrade Zhou Wenhuan's wife, Li Xianmei, the truth is as follows:

Li Xianmei was admitted to our school on August 30, 1947. Around October or November, Li Xianmei received a letter from her sister-in-law, which stated, "I heard that your husband was seriously injured," etc. Li told Comrade Yu Ping of our school, "He must have sacrificed himself; my sister-in-law is not telling me." During this period, Li Xianmei was detained by the Public Security Bureau for secretly carving the seal of the Wu'an County Committee on the street. She was released after Principal Zhang Bosheng of our school vouched for her. When asked why she carved the seal of the Wu'an County Committee, she said, "For fun." She also engaged in a romantic relationship with Li Yongshan, a student at our school. The school tried to dissuade her, but to no avail. Later, because Li Yongshan's father disagreed, their relationship did not succeed.

In the spring semester of 1948, Li Xianmei's enrollment was suspended by the school due to her improper behavior. She then returned to the Wu'an Rear Area Family School. We do not know what happened after that.

Comrade Zhou Wenhuan said, "Why did the Handan Middle School authorities approve her marriage to another cadre without any investigation?" The school is not a judicial administrative organ; what authority does it have to approve someone's marriage? We are issuing this correction to the newspaper to avoid misunderstandings.

Hebei Provincial Handan Middle School

Editor's Note: Regarding the issue of Zhou Wenhuan's wife, Li Xianmei, after receiving the replies from the Handan Town People's Government and Handan Middle School, we dispatched a special person to Handan for investigation. After various investigations, it has been proven that Li Xianmei did not marry any cadre of the Handan People's Government. Where Li Xianmei has gone has not yet been clarified. In addition to requesting the Handan Town People's Government to continue to investigate, we are publishing the corrections from the Handan Town Government and Handan Middle School.

### 周文焕妻失踪事件与邯郸镇政府无关  邯郸政府与邯郸中学来信声明

　　周文焕妻失踪事件与邯郸镇政府无关
    邯郸政府与邯郸中学来信声明
    一、邯郸镇人民政府来信编辑同志：
    五月十八日人民园地所载“革命军人家属另行结婚，二野周文焕来信抗议”一文，与事实不符（事实经过请参看邯郸中学的信）。根据我们的调查，事实如下：
    一、去年十一月七日，我们收到华北军政大学一总队政治部公函一件，今年一月又收到周文杰同志（周文焕同志的哥哥）来信一件，询问关于周文焕同志的妻子李仙梅与别人结婚一事。来信简单，没写明李仙梅是那里人，在邯郸何处。我们询问司法科，询问民政科，都不知道李仙梅与人结婚一事。所以迟至二月份，才由司法科复信说“不知有李仙梅此人”，请他们将李仙梅的详细情形告知我们，以便继续调查，并不是置之不理。
    二、人民园地发表周文焕同志的信以后，我们即向邯郸中学负责同志调查，事实经过一如邯郸中学复信中所说。至于说李仙梅“被邯郸市政府一个负有较大责任的干部以造谣撞骗手段侵占去了”一节，全非事实。在现有干部中，在已经北上或南下的干部中，都不闻有此事。周文焕同志所述恐系传闻之误。
    总之，李仙梅到那里去了，现在仍调查不清。李仙梅并没有经过政府批准与政府干部结婚，这是事实。周文焕同志的妻子李仙梅既在邯郸中学读过书，我们有责任调查这一问题。一有着落，即当函告。
                                  邯郸镇人民政府
    二、邯郸中学来信摘要编辑同志：
    关于周文焕同志的妻子李仙梅的问题，事实真相是这样的：
    李仙梅于一九四七年八月三十日考入我校。十月或十一月间，李仙梅接到她嫂嫂的信，信中有“听说你爱人受重伤”等语。李曾对我校俞平同志说：“他一定牺牲了，我嫂嫂不告诉我。”在这期间，李仙梅曾在街上偷刻武安县委会公章，被公安局扣留，经我校张泊生校长证明后释放。问她为什么刻武安县委会图章，她说：“为了玩”。她并和本校学生李永善搞恋爱。学校曾加以劝说，但无效。后因李永善父亲不同意，他们的恋爱并未成功。
    一九四八年春季开学，因李仙梅的行为不正，学校停止了她的学籍。她即回到武安后方家属学校。以后情形，我们不知道。
    周文焕同志说：“为什么邯郸中学当局，竟不经调查，随便批准她与另一干部结婚？”学校不是司法行政机关，有什么权力批准别人结婚呢？我们特向报纸提出更正，以免发生误会。
                                     河北省立邯郸中学
    编者按：关于周文焕的妻子李仙梅的问题，我们接到邯郸镇人民政府及邯郸中学的答复后，即派专人前往邯郸调查。经多方调查结果，证明李仙梅并未与邯郸人民政府的任何干部结婚。李仙梅到那里去了，还没有调查清楚。我们除请邯郸镇人民政府继续设法调查外，特把邯郸镇政府及邯郸中学的更正信发表出来。
