Unemployment and Unemployment Relief
	Shí Chǔ

	In recent months, the number of unemployed workers in major cities across the country has surged, with the situation being particularly severe in Shanghai, Wuhan, Nanjing, Chongqing, and Guangzhou. In Shanghai alone, the total number of unemployed workers has exceeded 150,000, and the total number of unemployed workers in major and medium-sized cities across the country is close to 1.2 million. After workers become unemployed, they and their families are in a state of extreme hardship: some live on thin gruel, some eat bean dregs, soybean cakes, chaff, and wild vegetables to stave off hunger, and the situation for some individuals is even more difficult than this. Among the unemployed workers, the majority are industrial workers, and a small number are clerks, shop assistants, and apprentices in factories.

	This serious situation has already attracted great attention from all levels of the country. Chairman Mao emphasized in his report on June 6th: "It is necessary to earnestly carry out relief work for unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals, and help the unemployed find employment in a step-by-step manner..." as one of the eight major tasks in the current struggle to achieve a fundamental improvement in the nation's financial and economic situation. The State Council has also followed Chairman Mao's instructions and promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Relief to Unemployed Workers" and issued the "Instructions on Relief to Unemployed Workers," specifically stipulating the principles, steps, and methods for relieving unemployed workers; and decided to allocate 400 million catties of grain from the national budget's reserve fund as an unemployment relief fund for this year.

	On the other hand, this serious situation has been widely met with high sympathy from employed workers, liberation fighters, public employees and teachers, various democratic parties, and people from all walks of life across the country, who have extended warm and loving hands to support their temporarily distressed brothers. As of the end of May, donations for relief to unemployed workers received from various parts of Guannei totaled 13,665,390,000 yuan; in the Northeast: as of May 26, a total of 78,300,050,700 Northeast yuan and more than 200,000 catties of grain had been received in donations for relief to unemployed workers.

	Why does such a serious unemployment problem still exist after the victory of the Liberation War?

	The reasons are complex but also simple: it is entirely a legacy of the old society. Generally speaking, unemployment is a product of the capitalist system. Capitalist countries constantly create a huge reserve army of labor, which continues to increase with the development of the capitalist system. Although China has not yet become a capitalist country in the past, due to the long-term rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, continuous plunder and destruction, draining the people's blood, and destroying the national industry and commerce, the entire country has fallen into a state of poverty, financial exhaustion, decline, and destruction. In this way, the unemployment problem existing in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China is sometimes even worse than that in capitalist countries! The current unemployment problem is undoubtedly created and accumulated by the reactionary regime before liberation, and is the result of the reactionary regime's long-term and cruel plunder of the people, but some of it was hidden in the past.

	After the liberation of the mainland, the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandits, with the direct support of US imperialism, carried out long-term blockades and bombings of our major coastal cities, causing major difficulties in our foreign trade, which in turn affected industrial production, commerce, and finance. Some industrial and commercial enterprises were unfortunately poisoned by the remaining bandits. On the other hand, after liberation, the national industry and commerce are facing a serious historical test. The semi-feudal and semi-colonial economy must be transformed into a new democratic economy, which makes those industrial and commercial industries that used to be exclusively for the extravagant luxury of landlords, compradors, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie, such as dance halls, restaurants, large hotels, silver and gold shops, silk shops, antique shops, etc., have to decline one after another with the collapse of the reactionary ruling class. In addition, a part of legitimate industry and commerce has also been greatly reduced because the purchasing power of the vast number of peasants and urban working people has been greatly reduced due to their long-term exploitation in the past and the disasters in some areas last year. At the same time, the price stability that came with the unified financial and economic work reversed the social psychology of "valuing goods over money," which on the one hand formed a temporary state of narrow market, and on the other hand, had to make the various business styles and backward and outdated business methods that had grown up in the long-term war caught off guard, and exposed their weaknesses one after another. All of the above have caused difficulties in industry and commerce, which in turn is the basic reason for the current unemployment of workers in major cities.

	From the above explanation, it is not difficult for us to understand that today's unemployment problem is entirely a legacy of the old society. It is the result of China's economy being exploited to the extreme poverty and decline, and it cannot continue to be hidden but is fully exposed in the process of China's economic transformation. It is also not difficult to understand that this unemployment phenomenon is only temporary. It is a difficulty in progress and development, and thus a difficulty that can be overcome. This unemployment phenomenon is fundamentally different from the unemployment phenomenon in capitalist countries. For capitalism, the unemployment phenomenon is a product of the system, something inherent and constant. Not only that, but capitalists create unemployment and are deeply interested in it because it can be shamelessly used as a powerful weapon against the proletariat. In capitalist countries, although the unemployment phenomenon can be temporarily reduced a little during the intervals of panic cycles, basically they are unwilling and unable to solve the unemployment problem. On the contrary, the unemployment phenomenon that occurs in the new democratic New China will inevitably gradually and step by step tend to disappear with the restoration and development of the entire Chinese national economy, because it is not a product of a social system but a legacy of the old society. Taking the Northeast as an example, because the land reform has been completed, social order has been stabilized, and economic construction has been on track, not only has the unemployment problem been solved, but also there is a shortage of workers and a large number of workers are being recruited from Guannei.

	In the new democratic economic system, it is possible and inevitable to eliminate unemployment. However, this does not mean that we can solve this problem all at once. No, basically, it will not be successful without three to five years or even more time to eliminate unemployment nationwide. Therefore, the work of relieving unemployed workers has to be planned for a relatively long period of time, with planning and steps. However, the current unemployment situation is very serious, and the lives of unemployed workers are very difficult, so emergency relief must be carried out immediately.

	Regarding the specific measures for relieving unemployed workers, the "Provisional Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers" promulgated by the State Council stipulate the following:

	1. Relief through work: The main thing is to carry out municipal construction projects, such as dredging rivers, repairing embankments, planting trees, repairing sewers, docks, building roads, parks, etc. The scope of these projects is very wide, accommodating a relatively large number of people, and generally does not require specialized technology, and the proportion of material costs is not large. Therefore, this is a more appropriate method and the main method for relieving unemployed workers at present. For example, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau has carried out five municipal construction projects, including leveling dirt roads, removing accumulated soil, tidying up sidewalks, dredging the Yuhe River, and quarrying, with a total of 29,987 people participating in the relief work, and a total of 164,300 catties of relief rice were issued.

	2. Production for self-relief: This method achieved great results in overcoming disasters last winter and this spring. Various production cooperatives can be organized, and workshops, farms or sideline production can be established according to the needs of the local conditions and the principle of voluntariness. In this way, some of the unemployed workers' families can also be organized into production, reducing the burden on the unemployed workers. It must be noted here that some workers were originally unemployed because the production sector in which they worked had a temporary relative surplus of production. When carrying out production for self-relief, do not blindly develop into sectors that are already oversupplied. Otherwise, it will squeeze out existing employed workers and create new unemployment, which is not good for the unemployed workers themselves.

	3. Returning to the countryside for production: Many of the workers in Chinese cities come from the countryside. They are bankrupt peasants, and many have not been in the city for long. They are familiar with the situation in the countryside, can generally engage in agricultural labor, and have relatives, friends, and friends in the countryside. Organizing this group of people to return to the countryside for production can not only reduce the burden on the city, but also increase agricultural production. Naturally, whether to return to the countryside should mainly be based on voluntariness, and forced orders should not be used. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth mobilization in advance, encourage them, and help them solve practical difficulties in various ways.

	4. Issuing relief money: The government still has to take care of unemployed workers who have not yet participated or cannot participate in the above three tasks and who are actually in real difficulty. That is, the situation is taken into consideration and relief money is issued, but the issuance of this relief money is subject to certain conditions, and will be stopped upon employment or resumption of work.

	5. Education and training: This is carried out in conjunction with the entire relief work in order to improve the political, cultural and technical level of unemployed workers. And organize retraining according to social needs. In terms of methods, those who participate in work relief and self-relief take part-time study, and the rest can organize collective study or retraining on the principle of voluntariness. For some unemployed workers who have a history of revolutionary struggle or have a certain level of education, they can be selected to participate in cadre training classes.

	The above methods fully demonstrate the government's truly responsible attitude and pragmatic spirit towards unemployed workers. Only the people's own government can specifically and actively solve such a serious unemployment problem.

	Capitalist countries sometimes handle unemployment relief in a plausible manner, but their relief methods are mainly a more cruel enslavement of unemployed workers. Under the names of "compulsory labor service" and the like, they adopt a military concentration camp method, forcing workers to do inhuman labor and live a miserable life worse than cattle and horses. Sometimes capitalists put on a hypocritical mask and give out some leftovers to deceive and mislead unemployed workers in order to ease workers' class struggle.

	Needless to say, the methods of relieving unemployed workers implemented by the People's Government today are fundamentally different from the methods of the above-mentioned capitalist countries. We replace forced enslavement with voluntary labor, and replace deception and camouflage with education and training. The government resolutely allocates 400 million catties of grain as a fund for relieving unemployed workers in the situation of extremely difficult national finances, and stipulates that people's governments at all levels should also try to allocate a part of the funds for the use of relieving unemployed workers. This is something that no capitalist country can do.

	People from all walks of life across the country must recognize that today's urban worker unemployment phenomenon is a legacy of the old society, and this difficulty must be overcome because it is very unfavorable to the recovery and development of the entire Chinese economy. The pain of unemployed workers is their own pain, and everyone should give the greatest sympathy. At the same time, they must not think that the government has carried out vigorous relief and stand idly by. They should uphold the spirit of "riding in the same boat" to unite and help each other, and continue to extend their supporting hands and actively transport them. Industrial and commercial operators should understand that the relationship between workers and themselves is the closest. In order to help the capitalists solve difficulties, the workers have already and continue to take measures such as increasing production and reducing wages, taking turns going home, and automatically suspending wages, and have done their best! It must be understood that worker unemployment is also detrimental to the development of industry and commerce. Employed workers should understand even more: "Workers all over the world are one family," and highly promote class friendship. Therefore, it is very reasonable and should be for industrial and commercial operators and employed workers to pay 1% of their monthly wages as an unemployment worker relief fund in accordance with the regulations of the State Council.

	As for unemployed workers, they must recognize the true meaning of this relief method, recognize that this is to overcome the difficulties left over from the reactionary regime. Recognize that the basis of this relief work is the government's spirit of being responsible to the people and the broad sympathy of society, and do not develop a one-sided dependence on this. They should work hard to produce, study hard, work hard, and automatically try to reduce the burden on the government in various ways and strive for the improvement of the situation.

	Our relief methods are correct, the relief fund is solid, and the government is taking a series of adjustments and support and other effective measures to improve the national private industry and commerce. This can guarantee that with the concerted cooperation of the whole country, we will be able to overcome the difficulties and steadily move from relieving unemployment to eliminating unemployment.

　　失业与失业救济
    石础
    最近几个月来，全国各大城市的失业工人人数激增，上海、武汉、南京、重庆、广州等地情形更为严重。仅上海一地，失业工人总数就已超过十五万人，全国大中城市失业工人总数约近一百二十万人。工人失业以后，他们及其家属的生活，都处于极端困苦的状态中：有的喝粥汤度日，有的以豆渣、豆饼、糠秕、野菜充饥，个别的景况甚至比这还更艰难一些。失业工人当中，主要是产业工人，也有一小部分是工厂里的职员、店员和学徒。
    这一严重的情况，早已引起全国上下极大的注意：毛主席在六月六日的报告中，更着重指出：“必须认真地进行对于失业工人和失业知识分子的救济工作，有步骤地帮助失业者就业……”为当前争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争的八大任务之一。政务院并已遵照毛主席的指示，公布了“救济失业工人暂行办法”，发布了“关于救济失业工人的指示”，具体规定了救济失业工人的方针、步骤与办法；并决定在本年度国家财政概算预备费项内，拨出四亿斤粮食作为失业救济基金。
    另一方面：这一严重的情况，普遍地获得了全国在业职工、解放战士、公教干部、各民主党派以及社会各阶层人士高度的同情，纷纷伸出热情友爱的手，来支援暂时处于困难中的自己的弟兄。截至五月底为止，已经收到关内各地救济失业工人捐款一百三十六亿六千五百三十九万元；东北方面：截至五月二十六日止，共计收到救济失业工人捐款东北币七百八十三亿零五十万七千余元及粮食二十余万斤。
    为什么在解放战争取得胜利以后，还会存在着这样严重的失业问题呢？
    原因很复杂但也很简单：这完全是旧社会所遗留下来的。一般地说：失业是资本主义制度的产物。资本主义国家经常制造出庞大的产业后备军，并且随着资本主义制度的发展而不断增加。中国虽然过去还未成为一个资本主义的国家，但是，由于帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的长期统治，不断的搜括掠夺与不断的战争破坏，吮尽了人民的膏血，摧毁了民族工商业，使整个国家陷于民穷财尽、衰落毁灭的境地。这样，半殖民地半封建的中国所存在的失业问题，有时竟比资本主义国家的严重性更恶劣一些！目前存在的失业问题，无疑的是解放前反动政权所制造与累积起来的，是反动政权对人民长期的、残酷的掠夺的结果，不过在过去有一部分被隐藏着罢了。
    大陆解放以后，残余的蒋匪帮在美帝国主义的直接支持下，对我沿海各大城市，肆行长期的封锁与轰炸，使我们的对外贸易发生重大困难，从而影响到工业生产与商业，金融业，一部分工商业不幸就遭了残余匪帮的毒手。另一方面：解放后全国工商业，正面临着一个严重的历史考验，半封建半殖民地的经济必须改造成为新民主主义经济，这就使得过去那些专供地主、买办、官僚资产阶级荒淫奢侈的工商行业，如舞厅、酒楼、大旅馆、银楼金铺、绸缎行、古董店等，不得不随着反动统治阶级的崩溃而纷纷趋于没落。另外一部分正当的工商业，则又因为广大的农民与城市中劳动人民的购买力，由于过去他们长期的被剥削与去年部分地区的灾荒而大为减低。同时，随着财经统一工作而来的物价稳定，扭转了社会“重物轻币”的心理，这在一方面形成了市场一时的狭小状态，另一方面则不得不使过去在长期战争中成长起来的各种习惯于投机倒把的经营作风与落后陈旧的经营方式，一时措手不及，纷纷暴露出自己的弱点。所有以上这一切，都使工商业发生了困难，从而也便是形成目前各大城市工人失业的基本原因。
    从上述说明中，我们不难了解，今天的失业问题完全是旧社会所遗留下来的，它是中国经济被剥削至极度贫困与破落的结果，在中国经济改造过程中无法继续隐藏而全部暴露出来的。同样也就不难了解：这种失业现象只是暂时的，它是进步与发展中的困难，从而也是可以克服的困难。这种失业现象与资本主义国家的失业现象根本是不同的，失业现象对资本主义来说：它是一种制度的产物，是内在的与经常的东西。不仅如此，资本家制造了失业并对其发生浓厚的兴趣，因为它可以被无耻地利用来作为反对无产阶级有力的武器。在资本主义国家中，失业现象虽然在恐慌周期的间歇中，能够暂时缩小一点，但是基本上它们是不愿意也不能够解决失业问题的。相反的，新民主主义新中国所发生的失业现象，由于它并不是一种社会制度的产物而是旧社会所遗留下来的，它就必然能够随着整个中国国民经济的恢复和发展，逐渐地，有步骤地趋于消灭。以东北为例：由于土地改革已经完成，社会秩序已经安定与经济建设工作已经走上轨道，不仅失业问题已经解决，而且感到工人不足大批向关内招聘。
    在新民主主义经济制度中，消灭失业是可能的与必然的。但是，这却并不是说我们一下子就可以解决这个问题。不，基本上要消灭全国的失业现象，没有三、五年以至更多的时间是不成功的。因此，救济失业工人的工作，不得不作比较长期的，有计划、有步骤的打算。然而目前失业情形是很严重的，失业工人生活是非常困难的，这又必需立即进行紧急的救济。
    关于救济失业工人的具体办法，政务院公布的“救济失业工人暂行办法”中规定如下：
    一、以工代赈：主要是举办市政建设工程，例如浚河、修堤、植树、修理下水道、码头、修建马路、公园等，这些工程的范围是很广的，容纳人数比较多，一般也不需要专门的技术，材料费用所占比例不大。因此，这是一种比较适宜的办法，也是目前救济失业工人的主要方法。例如北京市人民政府建设局举办了平修土路，清除积土，整理便道，疏浚御河及采石等五项市政建设工程，参加工赈劳动者共计二九、九八七人，共发工赈米一六四、三○○斤。
    二、生产自救：这一方法在去冬与今春克服灾荒中收到很大的效果。根据当地情况的需要与自愿的原则，可以组织各种生产合作社，设立工场作坊农场或进行副业生产。这样，就可以把一部分失业工人的家属也组织到生产里面来，减轻失业工人的负担。这里必须注意的是有些工人本来是因为他所工作的生产部门，发生一时的相对的生产过剩而失业的，在举办生产自救时，不要盲目的向生产已经过剩的部门发展。否则，便会排挤现有的在业工人，制造新的失业，对于失业工人自己也是不利的。
    三、还乡生产：中国城市里的工人，很多是从农村来的，他们是破了产的农民，而且很多到城市里也为时不久。他们熟悉农村的情形，一般都能从事农业劳动，并且与农村中都有亲属、亲戚、朋友等联系，把这一部人组织起来，还乡生产，既可减轻城市负担，又可增加农业生产。自然，还乡与否，主要应该根据自愿，不能使用强迫命令。因此，事前必须进行深入的动员，鼓励他们，并多方帮助他们解决实际的困难。
    四、发救济金：对于以上三项工作，一时尚未参加或不能参加而实际上又真正有困难的失业工人，政府仍然要予以照顾的。即酌量情形，发给救济金，但此项救济金的发放，要受一定条件的限制，同时，在就业或复工时即行停发。
    五、教育训练：这是结合整个救济工作来进行的，以便提高失业工人的政治、文化与技术水平。并根据社会需要，组织转业训练。方式方面，凡参加工赈与自救者采取业余学习，其余可在自愿的原则下，组织集体学习或转业训练，对于部分有革命斗争历史或有相当文化程度的失业工人，可选拔参加干部训练班。
    以上这些办法，充分表现了政府对于失业工人切实负责的态度与实事求是的精神，也只有人民自己的政府，才能够具体地与积极地来解决这样严重的失业问题。
    资本主义国家有时也若有其事地办理失业救济，然而它们的救济办法，主要是对于失业工人更残酷的奴役，在“义务工役”等名义下，采用军事集中营方式，强迫工人做非人的劳动，过着牛马不如的悲惨生活。资本家有时则戴上虚伪的面具，布施一些残羹冷饭来欺骗与蒙蔽失业工人，借以缓和工人的阶级斗争。
    不待说，今天人民政府所实施的救济失业工人的办法，与上述资本主义国家的办法是根本不同的。我们以自愿劳动代替强迫奴役，以教育训练代替欺骗蒙蔽，政府在国家财政极度困难的状况下，毅然拨出四亿斤粮食，作为救济失业工人的基金，并规定各级地方人民政府也应设法拨出一部分资金，作为救济失业工人之用，这都是任何资本主义国家所无法做到的。
    全国各阶层人民，必须认清今天城市工人失业现象，是旧社会遗留下来的，这一困难必须设法克服，因为它对整个中国经济的恢复与发展是十分不利的。失业工人的痛苦就是自己的痛苦，每个人都应该寄予最大的同情。同时，也不能以为政府已进行大力救济而袖手旁观，应该本“同舟共济”的精神，团结互助，继续不断地伸出支援的手，踊跃输将。工商业者应该明了工人与自己的关系最密切，工人为帮助资方解决困难，已经并继续采取增产减薪，轮流回家，自动停薪等办法，尽了他们最大的努力！必须明白工人失业对于工商业的发展也是不利的。在业职工更应明了：“天下工人是一家”，高度发扬阶级友爱。因此，工商业者与在业职工，依照政务院规定，按月缴付工资的百分之一作为失业工人的救济基金，都是十分合理与应该的。
    至于失业工人，必须认清这种救济办法的真实意义，认清这是为了克服反动政权遗留下来的困难。认清这种救济工作的基础是政府对人民负责的精神与社会广大的同情，不可因此产生片面的依赖思想。应该努力生产，努力学习，艰苦奋斗，自动的多方设法减轻政府的负担，争取情况的好转。
    我们的救济办法是正确的，救济基金是稳固的，加以政府对全国私营工商业的好转，正在进行一连串的调整与扶植等有效措施，这就可以保证在全国上下通力合作中，一定能够度过难关，稳步地从救济失业逐渐走向消灭失业的大道上去。
