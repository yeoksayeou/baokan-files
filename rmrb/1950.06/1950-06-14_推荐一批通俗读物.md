Recommending a Batch of Popular Readings
    Wen Chong, Han Bo
    Recently, we have heard many comrades working in factory libraries or people's cultural centers say that there are not many new popular readings, and the content varies in quality. They don't know which books are more appropriate to buy. Therefore, we have compiled a list of the popular books we have recently reviewed, selecting those with relatively accessible language, generally sound content, and beneficial to workers and peasants, for your reference.
    (1) Popular Small Library, published by Xinhua Bookstore. This is a series of small books, including short popular literature and various common knowledge. Each book ranges from four or five thousand words to more than ten thousand words, printed in 50-open format. It is suitable for workers, peasants, and general citizens with a literacy level equivalent to upper primary school and first-year junior high school. More than 20 volumes have been published. Here are a dozen or so for your consideration:
    The Sun Shines into Everyone's Home (Selected Poems by Textile Workers)
    The Song of the Railway (Selected Poems by Railway Workers)
    Transformation (Collection of Short Stories, Works by Workers)
    Red Flowers Need Green Leaves (Novel Written by Workers)
    We Workers Have Strength (Collection of Workers' Songs)
    Dragon (Selected Folk Tales)
    Studying Well (Yangko Opera)
    Competition (Yangko Opera)
    Emancipation and Happiness (Yangko Opera)
    Good Friends (Some Stories About How Soviet People Help Chinese People)
    The Story of Lenin
    Quick Clapper: Little Erhei Gets Married
    The Way of Persistent Harm (Yangko Opera)
    Don't Rely on Gods for Everything (Talks on Everyday Knowledge)
    Methods of Raising Pigs
    Infant Care Knowledge
    Women's Health Knowledge
    Prevention and Control of Crop Pests
    (2) Mass Literature Series, edited by Beijing Literature Society, distributed by Beijing Book Industry Association Service Department. This series of books is written by literary writers such as Zhao Shuli. Each book is only a few thousand words long and printed in 32-open format. The following are the titles we have seen so far:
    Shi Bulan Drives the Cart (Recitative, telling the story of peasants' liberation)
    Sending the Red Jacket (Quick Clapper Opera, writing about marriage in the new countryside)
    Wang Xiaocai Enters Winter School (Quick Clapper Opera, promoting the literacy campaign)

Unlike the Beijing Literature Society series, which is almost entirely recitative, this series includes works of various genres, and the length is also relatively long, ranging from fifteen thousand to thirty thousand words per volume. The following are the titles we have seen so far:
    Dan Bianlang (Collection of Folk Tales)
    Borrowing Rice and Returning Rice (Collection of Folk Tales)
    Zhang Suo Buys a Cow (Three Long Poems, about free marriage and land reform, etc.)
    Wang Piqin Walks the Southern Road (Two Recitatives)
    (4) New Quyi Series, published by Xinhua Bookstore, co-edited by Beijing Mass Literature Creation Research Association and two other units. It is a collection of new Quyi scripts (that is, the Mass Literature Series mentioned above) selected from performances in Beijing. The content is all about singing the stories of workers, peasants, and soldiers. A small part is adapted from old stories. The following collections have been published, each collection containing four or five to seven or eight recitatives:

    Female Driver Tian Guiying
    Twenty Catties of Rice
    (5) Some books published by the Workers' Publishing House, except for some that are more in-depth content for trade union cadres, the rest are popular literary works or supplementary teaching materials, such as:
    Shi Bulan Drives the Cart (Same as the one published by the Book Industry Association)
    Tiger (Seven short stories, writing about workers after liberation, all works by workers)
    Nine Clothes (Comic Strip)

    The above are popular books published in Beijing. Now let's talk about other places.
    (6) Hebei United Publishing House has published dozens of popular books, including some small pamphlets on agricultural production technology. They are short in length and the selection of materials is very relevant to the actual needs of the countryside. The titles are:
    How to Raise Chicks
    How to Prevent Chicken Plague
    A Brief Introduction to Manure Accumulation
    Prevention and Treatment of Wheat Yellowing Disease

    The Mine is My Home (Four Short Stories)

    Civil School Production Knowledge Teaching Materials (A total of four volumes: 1. Fertilizer, farm tools, livestock; 2. Intensive cultivation; 3. Eliminating diseases and insect pests; 4. Water conservancy construction. The above is published in Shandong.)
    In addition to the above publishing houses, some other bookstores also have some popular books worth introducing. Now, according to the nature of the content, here are some listed below:
    (8) Several collections introducing labor heroes, production models, or the progress of general workers:
    Work Harder (Published by Dalian Xinhua)
    Heroic Deeds (Compiled and printed by the Dalian General Trade Union)
    The Banner of the Working Class (Published by Shanghai Labor Publishing House) The latter two are more in-depth in writing and are suitable for readers with higher levels.
    (9) Regarding political common sense, Shanghai Popular Culture Publishing House published a set of Mass Political Readers. The writing is quite popular and easygoing. Except for "New Democracy and Old Democracy," which is inappropriate, most of the others also have their own shortcomings. Two are relatively well written, namely
    Chinese Geography

　　推荐一批通俗读物
    文崇　韩伯
    近来听到许多工厂图书室或人民文化馆的工作同志们说，新的通俗读物不太多，内容好坏也不一致，不知道有些什么比较适当的书可以购买。因此我们把最近来翻阅过的通俗书，就其中文字比较通俗、内容没大毛病而有益于工农的开一个单子，供大家参考。
    （一）通俗小文库，新华书店出版，这是一套小型的丛书，内容包括短篇通俗文艺和各种常识，每册篇幅自四五千字到一万多字不等，用五十开本排印，适合于高小和初中一年级程度的工农和一般市民阅读，已出版二十多册，现在拣十几种介绍如下：

    （九）关于政治常识的，上海通俗文化出版社出了一套大众政治读本，文字相当通俗轻松，内容除“新民主与旧民主”一种不妥，其余多数也各有缺点外，有两种比较写得好，就是

    至于识字教材，另外再写文介绍。
