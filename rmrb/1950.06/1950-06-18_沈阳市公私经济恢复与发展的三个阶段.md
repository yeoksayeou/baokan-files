　　The Three Stages of Public and Private Economic Recovery and Development in Shenyang

Shenyang is an industrial city and the political and economic center of Northeast China. The recovery and reconstruction of Shenyang's public and private production after liberation has become our overriding central task. According to statistics from March of this year, the city's state-owned factories, which at the time of liberation included only 25 factories operating or partially operating (excluding railway factories), have now been fully restored. The number of employees has increased from 4,675 at the time of liberation to 152,679, including those in publicly owned factories. In the first quarter of this year, with the exception of a few factories that did not fully complete their production plans, the remaining factories have completed or even exceeded their production plans.

The main reason for the rapid completion of the recovery plan by state-owned enterprises is that they changed the management of factories under imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, and adopted a policy of relying on workers and uniting technical personnel and staff. Factory management committees were universally established, making factory management democratic, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the working class. They engaged in restoring production and participating in factory management with the attitude of masters.

Due to the recovery and development of state-owned factories, private enterprises have also been strongly supported and assisted in their recovery and development, giving full play to the leading role of the state economy. This is particularly evident in processing orders and supplying raw materials. Without the recovery and development of state-owned enterprises, the development of private enterprises would be unimaginable. At the same time, it also solved the serious problem of unemployment at that time. Since liberation, more than 100,000 people have found employment in public and private enterprises, and the lives of the working people have begun to improve initially. For example, the actual income of employees in state-owned enterprises has increased by 27 percent from the time of liberation to the end of last year, and the funds paid by the state for labor insurance and various welfare benefits have reached about 10 percent of the total wage bill. This shows that although the Northeast People's Government was still in a situation where Tianjin and Peiping had not yet been liberated and supporting the war was still the top priority, it resolutely adopted the correct policy of tightening government spending and keeping wages low in order to increase investment in production to restore all important industries in Shenyang. Regarding private industry in Shenyang, due to the recovery and development of state-owned and public-owned enterprises and agricultural production in the entire Northeast, as of the statistics for April of this year, the number of factories increased from 6,546 at the time of liberation to 13,459, and the number of employees increased from 26,008 to 56,328. Comparing April 1949 with April this year, the capital increased from 710.5 million yuan to 1,708.1 million yuan (Northeast currency, the same below).

The recovery and development of private industry and commerce in this city has generally gone through the following three stages:

First stage: From the liberation of Shenyang in November 1948 to the end of April 1949, the number of industrial enterprises suddenly increased from 6,546 to 9,727. The most prominent industries were textiles, knitwear, iron, and vegetable oil manufacturing. In commerce, the number also increased from 11,034 to 20,094. The most prominent were gold shops, hardware stores, agencies, cart inns, sundries shops, and peddlers. The main reasons for the development of industry and commerce during this period were: 1. The liberation of the entire Northeast and the unimpeded transportation ended the long-term isolation between urban and rural areas, and rapid urban-rural exchanges enabled industry and commerce to recover and develop. 2. The active recovery and operation of state-owned enterprises stimulated private factories that had previously processed for these enterprises, and they also prepared to resume operations, such as the iron and electrical industries. 3. Politically, the implementation of the urban policies of the Communist Party of China, the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Government, shattered the rumors and slanders of the US-Chiang reactionaries, coupled with the influence of the protection of legitimate industry and commerce in cities such as Harbin in North Manchuria, dispelled the concerns of industrialists and merchants, and also played a significant role.

Second stage: From May to October 1949, the private industry and commerce suddenly showed a state of stagnation, wait-and-see attitude, and shrinkage. In industry, although the total number of households did not change much, the number of employees decreased, and the production of iron and textile industries was abnormal. Some factories in the paper-making, dyeing and finishing, rubber, and grain processing industries closed down. The situation in commerce during this period was that a total of 1,670 households went bankrupt, among which gold and silver shops, silk and cotton sundries shops, clothing and leather goods shops, grain shops, and agencies suffered the most bankruptcies. However, some industries directly related to industrial production and rural needs still achieved relative development, such as the iron shop industry and the industrial raw material industry, both of which increased in the number of households. The stagnation and shrinkage of private industry and commerce during this period was partly an inevitable result of the transformation of the old economic organization, the old production system, and the old management methods, and partly due to its recovery and development in the first stage being incompatible with the recovery and development of the new national industry and the new agricultural production, while also being seriously blind and speculative.

Third stage: From October 1949 to the present. This period is the beginning of the normal development of industry and commerce in this city. On the one hand, industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have continued to develop, such as the machinery and iron industry. From April 1949 to April this year, the number of households increased from 506 to 909, the capital increased from 107.4 million yuan to 544.1 million yuan, and the number of employees increased from 4,041 to 8,097. During the same period, the rubber industry increased from 70 households to 340 households, the capital increased from 11.1 million yuan to 88.4 million yuan, and the number of employees increased from 526 to 3,076. The paper industry increased from 9 households to 39 households, the capital increased from 4.1 million yuan to 25.6 million yuan, and the number of employees increased from 168 to 497. On the other hand, industries that are not conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood or are not needed by the masses at the moment continue to shrink or even shut down and go bankrupt. This is particularly evident in commerce, such as agencies, silk and cotton sundries shops, and gold shops. However, legitimate commerce has also achieved some development. The 544 households that the government helped to switch industries have also developed after switching industries. Peddlers have also gradually entered production with the development of production. According to statistics for April, they have decreased from 40,376 households at the time of liberation in 1948 to 20,171 households.

The main reason for the beginning of normal development of private industry and commerce during this period is that the recovery and development of industry and agriculture in Northeast China has provided private industry and commerce with a certain guarantee in the supply of raw materials and products, and found a way out in processing orders and markets. For example, the total output value of the machinery and iron industry in the first quarter of this year is equal to 41 percent of the total for the entire year of last year. The total amount of processing and ordering entrusted by state-owned and public-owned enterprises in the first quarter has exceeded the total amount of processing and ordering for the entire year of last year. In addition, the government is also making necessary adjustments in public-private relations, helping private industry solve difficulties in raw materials and sales, and appropriately adjusting labor-capital relations, all of which are reasons for the normal continued development of industry and commerce.

In terms of public-private relations, after the instructions and approval of the higher-level government, some necessary adjustments have also been made in the past, resolving the multi-headed management of military supplies, railway, and electric power-specific equipment and raw materials under military control, thereby helping private industry with difficulties in raw materials, power, and capital turnover. For example, during the off-season, it supported 25 tons of picric acid, 13,550 tons of hardware raw materials, 15 tons of oil, 1,552 horsepower of power equipment, and 90 billion yuan in bank loans. The problem of private enterprises freely engaging in concurrent industries and transactions was resolved, and a relationship was established between state-owned stores as agents for private enterprises, solving the difficulties in promoting various products of private enterprises. The total sales volume in 1949 was 408.9 million yuan. From January to April of this year, it has also sold 106.25 billion yuan. Due to the adjustment and care of public-private relations (although not enough, and some problems still exist), private enterprises have not only developed, but also, by helping them overcome the difficulties of the off-season, this has greatly helped the public in this year's processing orders and agency purchases.

Regarding the production and sales problems of private enterprises, in addition to organizing public processing orders and agency sales, we have helped several industries to try to organize their own joint venture institutions to solve their difficulties in promoting finished products, undertaking processing orders, and purchasing raw materials. The iron industry, paper industry, and textile industry have now been formed. The number of households that have participated in the joint venture organization includes 661 iron factories, 22 paper mills, and 416 textile mills.

In terms of labor-capital relations, necessary adjustments have been made in response to the specific situation in this city. From the time the iron industry labor-capital collective contract was deliberated and signed in September last year to the present, collective contracts have been signed in 25 major industries in the city and have been approved and implemented by the Labor Bureau. In addition, 144 various contracts and agreements have been approved for the record. Since the signing of these contracts and agreements, labor-capital relations have generally been developing in accordance with equal, mutually beneficial, and normal contractual relations. At the same time, in early February of this year, appropriate adjustments were made in a timely manner to the issue of old year-end bonuses and gifts, which were beneficial to both labor and capital. Therefore, labor-capital disputes decreased from 113 in December last year to 45 in April of this year.

Since the signing of labor-capital contracts and various agreements in this city, not only has labor-capital relations been appropriately adjusted, but it has also promoted the continued development of production. For example, Jianxing Iron Factory once shrunk due to abnormal labor-capital relations, from 75 workers to 31 workers. After the contract was signed, labor-capital relations were adjusted, and with the development of the state-owned economy, production gradually recovered and developed. There are now 95 workers and 29 various lathes. The production enthusiasm of the workers has also been improved. For example, in March, the capital contracted 1 billion yuan of work from the Non-Ferrous Metals Administration, with a deadline of 30 days. As a result, the task was completed six days ahead of schedule. Now a labor-capital consultation meeting has been organized to negotiate and pass the factory's three-month production plan, and both parties guarantee to complete the task on time.

　　沈阳市公私经济恢复与发展的三个阶段
    沈阳是一座工业城市，是东北政治经济的中心，解放后恢复与重建沈阳市的公私生产，成为我们压倒一切的中心任务。根据今年三月份的统计，本市的国营工厂，由解放当时接收中仅开工或半开工的二十五厂（铁路工厂不在内），现在所有国营工厂都已全部恢复了，职工从解放当时的四千六百七十五名，现在连公营工厂在内共增加到十五万二千六百七十九名，今年第一季除个别工厂未全部完成生产计划外，其余工厂都完成以至超过了生产计划。
    国营企业迅速完成恢复计划的主要原因，是改变了帝国主义、官僚资本主义的工厂管理，而采取了依靠工人、团结技术人员与职员的方针，普遍建立了工厂管理委员会，使工厂管理民主化，从而大大的发挥了工人阶级的积极性，并以主人翁的姿态，从事恢复生产与参加工厂管理。
    由于国营工厂的恢复和发展，对于私营企业的恢复和发展，也给了有力的支持和帮助，发挥了国家经济的领导作用，特别表现在加工定货和原材料的供给上，没有国家企业的恢复发展，私营企业的发展是不可想像的。同时，还解决了当时职工失业的严重问题。解放以来，有十余万人到公私企业中获得了就业，从而劳动人民的生活，也开始获得了初步的改善。如现在国营企业职工的实际收入，自解放后至去年底已增加了百分之二十七，而国家为劳动保险和各种福利支付的经费，又达到工资总额的百分之十左右。这说明东北人民政府当时虽然处在平津尚未解放，支援战争仍是头等任务的情况下，但却决然采取了紧缩政费与低工薪政策，以增加生产投资，来恢复沈阳市一切重要工业的方针是正确的。关于沈阳市的私营工业，由于全东北国公营企业和农业生产的恢复和发展，截至本年四月份的统计，工厂户从解放当时的六、五四六户，增加到一三、四五九户，职工从二六、○○八人增加到五六、三二八人，资本金以一九四九年四月份与今年四月份来比较，从七、一○五亿元增加到一七、○八一亿元（东北币，下同）。
    本市私营工商业的恢复发展，大体经过了以下三个过程：
    第一阶段：从一九四八年十一月沈阳解放至一九四九年四月末，这时期的工业由六、五四六户，突然增加到九、七二七户。其中最突出的行业有纺织业、针织业、铁工业和植物油制造业等。在商业上也随着由一一、○三四户增加到二○、○九四户。其中最突出的是金店、五金行、代理店、大车店、下杂货和摊贩游商等业。这个时期工商业发展的主要原因是：一、全东北解放，交通畅通，解除了长期间城乡的隔绝，城乡急速交流使工商业得到了复业和发展。二、国营企业积极的恢复和开工，对过去围绕这些企业加工的私营工厂，起了刺激的作用，也纷纷筹备恢复。如铁工业和电器工业。三、在政治上由于中国共产党、人民解放军和人民政府的城市政策的贯彻执行，粉碎了美蒋反动派的造谣污蔑，加上北满哈尔滨等城市保护正当工商业的影响，打破了工商业者的顾虑，也起了很大的作用。
    第二阶段：从一九四九年五月至十月，这时期的私营工商业又突呈停滞、观望、萎缩的状态。在工业上，虽然总的户数没有多大的变动，但职工人员减少了，铁工业、纺织业生产不正常，造纸、染整、橡胶、粮米加工等业，部分工厂歇业。这期间表现在商业上的情况，倒闭的共有一、六七○户，其中金店银楼、丝棉杂货、衣帽细皮业、粮谷业、代理店倒闭者最多。但部分与工业生产和农村需要直接有关的行业仍得到了相对的发展，其中如铁店业工业原料业的户数均有增加。这个时期私营工商业的停滞、萎缩，一方面是旧的经济组织、旧的生产制度、旧的经营方法在改造过程中必然的结果，另一方面也是和它在第一阶段期内的恢复发展与新的国家工业，新的农业生产的恢复发展不相适应而又带有严重的盲目性和投机性所造成的结果。
    第三阶段：从一九四九年十月截至现在。这个时期，是本市工商业开始向着正常发展的时期。一方面，有利于国计民生的行业得到继续的发展，如机械铁工业，从一九四九年四月到今年四月，户数从五○六户增到九○九户，资本金从一、○七四亿元增到五、四四一亿元，职工从四、○四一名增到八、○九七名。同一时期，橡胶业从七○户增加到三四○户，资本金从一一一亿元增加到八八四亿元，职工从五二六名增到三、○七六名。制纸业从九户增至三十九户，资本金从四一亿元增至二五六亿元，职工从一六八名增到四九七名。另一方面，不利于国计民生或一时不为群众所需要的行业，仍然继续在萎缩以至于歇业和倒闭。特别是商业表现得最显著。如代理店、丝棉杂货、金店等业。但正当的商业，也获得了一定的发展。政府帮助转业的五四四户，在转业后也都得到了发展。摊贩游商也随着生产的发展，逐渐转入了生产，据四月份的统计，已从一九四八年解放时的四○、三七六户，减至二○、一七一户。
    这时期私营工商业获得开始正常发展的主要原因是，东北工农业的恢复与发展，使私营工商业在原料和产品的供应上，得到了一定的保证，在加工订货和市场上找到了出路。如机械铁工业今年第一季度之生产总值等于去年全年的百分之四十一。国公营第一季度委托加工及订货之总额已超出去年全年加工、订货之总额。另外，政府尚在公私关系上进行必要调整，帮助私营工业解决原料、销路等困难，并适当调整了劳资关系，均为工商业正常继续发展的原因。
    在公私关系上，经过了上级政府的指示和批准，过去也进行了一些必要的调整，解决了军管期内，军工、铁路、电业专用器材和原料统制的多头管理，从而帮助了私营工业在原料动力和资金周转上的困难，如在青黄不接期间支持了苦味酸二五吨，五金原料一三、五五○吨，油脂一五吨，动力设备一、五五二匹马力，银行贷款九百亿元。解决了私营企业自由兼业和交易的问题，建立了国营商店为私营企业代销的关系，解决私营企业各种产品在推销上的困难。计一九四九年共代销总额为四、○八九亿元。今年一月到四月也已代销到一○、六二五亿元。由于公私关系的调整和照顾（虽不够，并还存有若干问题）不但使私营企业获得了发展，而且，由于帮助他们克服了青黄不接的困难，这对于公家今年的加工订货和代销收购，也获得了很大帮助。
    关于私营企业的产销问题，除了我们组织公家加工定货和代销外，曾帮助了几个行业试行组织了自己联营的机构，解决他们在推销成品、承揽加工订货、购买原料中的困难。现在已经组成的有铁工业、造纸业和纺织业。已参加联营组织的户数，计铁工厂有六六一户，造纸业有二二户，纺织业有四一六户。
    在劳资关系上，针对着本市当时的具体情况曾进行了必要的调整。从去年九月铁工业劳资集体合同酝酿签订至现在，已在全市二十五个主要行业中签订了集体合同，并经劳动局批准执行。另外批准备案的各种契约、合同一四四件。从这些合同、契约签订后，劳资关系一般的是遵循着平等的、两利的、正常的契约关系发展着。同时，在今年二月初，对于旧年年终花红馈赠问题，又及时作了有利于劳资双方的适当调整。因此，劳资争议由去年十二月份的一一三件减为今年四月份的四五件。
    从本市劳资合同和各种契约签订以来，不仅劳资关系得到了适当的调整，也促进了生产的继续发展。如建兴铁工厂过去因为劳资关系不正常，曾一度萎缩，由七十五名工人，减为三十一名。合同订立后，劳资关系得到了调整，因而随着国营经济的发展，生产又逐步恢复与发展起来，现有工人九十五人，各种车床二十九台，工人的生产积极性也提高了，如三月份资方包了有色金属管理局十亿元的活，限期三十天，结果提前六天完成了任务。现在已组织了劳资协商会，协商通过了全厂三个月的生产计划，双方保证按期完成任务。
