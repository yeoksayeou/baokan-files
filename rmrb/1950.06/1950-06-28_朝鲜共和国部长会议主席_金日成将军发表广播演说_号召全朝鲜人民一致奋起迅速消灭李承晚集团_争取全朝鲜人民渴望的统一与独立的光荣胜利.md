Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 27th. General Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Korean Democratic People's Republic, delivered a radio address at 8:00 AM on the 26th, denouncing the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's criminal act of launching a civil war under the instigation of US imperialism and calling on all Korean people to rise up unanimously, unite closely around the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic, and swiftly eliminate the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's military and police system, in order to strive for the glorious victory of national unification and independence that is unanimously desired by all Korean people. The full text of the speech is as follows:

　　Dear compatriots!
　　Dear brothers and sisters!
　　Officers and soldiers of the People's Army!
　　Guerrilla fighters active in the southern half of the Republic!

　　On behalf of the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic, I issue the following call to you:

　　The puppet government army of the traitor Syngman Rhee launched a full-scale offensive against the northern region along the entire 38th parallel on June 25th. The brave security forces of the Republic launched a fierce battle to resist the enemy's offensive and thwarted the Syngman Rhee puppet government's army's offensive.

　　After discussing the current situation, the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic has ordered our People's Army to begin a counter-offensive to eliminate the enemy's armed forces.

　　Following the orders of the Republic's government, the People's Army has driven back the enemy forces in the area north of the 38th parallel and has advanced 10 to 15 kilometers south of the 38th parallel. The People's Army has already liberated cities such as Ongjin, Yeon-an, Baegcheon (all in Hwanghae Province), and Gaeseong (in Gyeonggi Province), as well as many villages.

　　Although all patriotic and democratic forces in our country have been striving to achieve the peaceful unification of the fatherland, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang has launched a fratricidal civil war against the people. As is well known, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, which opposes the peaceful unification of the fatherland, has long been preparing for a fratricidal civil war. Although the South Korean people are hovering on the brink of starvation, the Syngman Rhee puppet government has wasted most of the heavy taxes forcibly collected from the people on expanding military spending and preparing for civil war. The Syngman Rhee reactionaries have frantically prepared graves in order to provoke a civil war.

　　They have established a reactionary police system in South Korea, forced all democratic political parties and social organizations to go underground, and arrested, imprisoned, and murdered patriotic progressive figures. Anyone who expresses even the slightest dissatisfaction with the Syngman Rhee's reactionary system and his preparations for civil war will be persecuted.

　　Syngman Rhee, the national enemy of the Korean people, has implemented anti-people reactionary policies, imprisoning or torturing hundreds of thousands of the best sons and daughters of our country who are fighting for the independence, freedom, and democratic development of the fatherland.

　　In order to cover up their ongoing civil war preparations, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang has continuously created conflicts along the 38th parallel, causing unrest to the fatherland and the people, and attempting to shift the responsibility for the conflicts to our People's Republic government. In the process of preparing for the so-called "Northern Expedition," the Syngman Rhee bandit gang has even unhesitatingly colluded with the Japanese militarists, the mortal enemies of the Korean people, in accordance with the instructions of the US imperialists. In order to maintain their own selfish interests and reactionary rule, and to turn our country into a colony of US imperialism and a military base in Asia, and a source of profit for American monopolistic capitalists, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang has completely placed the economy of the southern half of our country under the control of American monopolistic capitalists.

　　In order to colonize our country economically, the US imperialists have done their utmost to destroy the national economy in the southern half of the Republic. Under the pressure of American capital, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and merchants have been forced to go bankrupt. In the southern half of our country, production has stagnated, most factories and workshops have closed down, and the number of unemployed has reached millions. Farmers have not yet received land. The people are hovering on the brink of starvation.

　　Dear compatriots! The government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic, all patriotic and democratic political parties and social organizations in our country, and the entire people, have made every effort to avoid fratricidal civil war and the tragedy of bloodshed, and to strive for the unification of our fatherland by peaceful means. As early as April 1948, a joint conference of representatives of political parties and social organizations from North and South Korea put forward the desire to peacefully unify our country. However, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang undermined this desire. With the support of US imperialism and its aggressive tool, the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea," the Syngman Rhee bandit gang fabricated a separate "election" in South Korea on May 10, 1948, and strengthened its armed attacks and preparations against the northern half of our country.

　　In order to strive for the peaceful unification and complete independence of the fatherland, last June, seventy-one patriotic political parties and social organizations from North and South Korea, under the banner of the Fatherland Front, proposed to peacefully unify our country by holding general elections. The entire Korean people enthusiastically supported and endorsed this proposal, but the Syngman Rhee bandits also undermined this proposal.

　　On June 7, 1950, the Fatherland Front once again put forward a plan to promote the peaceful unification of the fatherland, reflecting the will of the Korean people who desire the peaceful unification of the fatherland.

　　However, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang threatened that anyone who expressed support for the Fatherland Front's peaceful unification plan would be considered a traitor, and therefore this plan was also undermined.

　　On June 19, 1950, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Korean Democratic People's Republic, based on the firm will and desire of various democratic political parties and social organizations to demand the unification, independence, and democratic development of the fatherland, proposed to realize the peaceful unification of the fatherland by combining the Supreme People's Assembly of the Korean Democratic People's Republic and the South Korean "National Assembly" to establish a single all-Korean legislative body.

　　How did the Syngman Rhee bandit gang respond to this just proposal, which was expected by all the Korean people?

　　The Syngman Rhee bandit gang, which betrayed the interests of the Korean people, responded to the expectations of all the Korean people for the peaceful unification of the fatherland by launching a civil war.

　　What kind of goals do the reactionary bandits want to achieve in the civil war they launched?

　　The Syngman Rhee bandit gang vainly attempts to implement in the northern half of the Republic the anti-people reactionary ruling system that currently exists in the southern half, which is no different from the era of Japanese imperialism, in order to seize the achievements of the democratic reforms that our people have already achieved. The Syngman Rhee bandit gang vainly attempts to seize land from the farmers who have become landowners as a result of the implementation of land reform based on the principle of uncompensated confiscation and uncompensated distribution in the northern half of the Republic, and return it to the landlords, and to deprive the Korean people of all the democratic freedoms and rights they have already achieved in the northern half of our Republic. The Syngman Rhee bandit gang vainly attempts to turn our country into a colony of US imperialism, and to make the Korean people slaves of US imperialists. (14)

　　Dear brothers and sisters: Our fatherland and people are facing great danger. What needs to be done to eliminate the current danger facing our fatherland?

　　In this war against the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, the Korean people must resolutely defend the Korean Democratic People's Republic and its constitution, overthrow the anti-people fascist Syngman Rhee puppet regime in the southern half, liberate the southern half of our country from the rule of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and restore the true people's power—the People's Committee—in the southern half. Under the leadership of the Korean Democratic People's Republic, complete the unification of the fatherland in order to build a strong, democratic, and independent country. The war we are waging against the civil war launched by the Syngman Rhee traitorous bandit gang is a just war to fight for the unification, independence, freedom, and democracy of the fatherland.

　　Dear compatriots: If all the Korean people do not want to become slaves of foreign imperialists once again, they should rise up unanimously in the struggle to save the country by overthrowing the Syngman Rhee traitorous bandit gang, and spare no sacrifice to strive for victory. All Korean people should pay close attention to every move of US imperialism, which is standing behind the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and raise their vigilance.

　　Our People's Army should safeguard the various democratic reforms in the northern half of the Republic, rescue the compatriots in the southern half from reactionary rule, and under the banner of the People's Republic, display our courage and creativity in the struggle for the unification of the fatherland. For the sake of the fatherland and the people, we should spare our lives and devote our patriotic loyalty to fighting to the last drop of blood.

　　The officers and soldiers of our People's Army come from the people and are composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the fatherland and the people. They are cultivated with the spirit of patriotism and love for the people, and are equipped with the latest modern and sophisticated weapons. They are the army of the Korean people, who have a high degree of awareness that they are constantly fighting for the interests of the fatherland and the people.

　　The people in the northern half of the Republic should reorganize all their undertakings into a wartime footing. In order to ruthlessly annihilate and wipe out the enemy in a short period of time, all forces must be mobilized. All work should be subordinated to the task of war and annihilating the enemy. The entire nation should be organized to assist the People's Army, continuously supply the front lines, provide them with all necessities, and ensure the urgent transportation of military supplies. Extensive and loving care work should be organized for the wounded soldiers. Everything must be organized to successfully complete the front-line supply and consolidate the rear of the People's Army.

　　In the rear, there must be a merciless struggle against saboteurs and rumor-mongers, and the work of eliminating secret agents and subversive elements should be carried out swiftly. The enemy is cunning and insidious, and it will inevitably spread rumors in various ways; we must not be deceived by reactionary propaganda. The organs of the Republic's government should eliminate all saboteurs who hinder the entire people from waging a war to achieve unification, freedom, and independence.

　　Workers, technicians, and staff members in the northern half of the Republic must prevent enemy attacks with a high degree of vigilance in order to protect all the Republic's factories, workshops, railways, transportation, communications, post and telecommunications, and organs. They must faithfully implement production plans and the tasks they are responsible for, and guarantee the needs of the front lines in a timely and rapid manner with devoted efforts.

　　Farmers in the northern half of the Republic must strive to ensure the People's Army's food supply and produce more crops. At the same time, in order to guarantee the victory of the People's Army, they should do their best to provide assistance in all aspects.

　　Male and female guerrilla fighters in the southern half of the Republic should launch a more intense and heroic guerrilla movement, strive for the participation of the broad masses of the people in the guerrilla forces, expand and establish liberated areas, annihilate the enemy behind enemy lines, disrupt the enemy's operational plans, attack enemy headquarters, and cut off and destroy railways, highways, bridges, and telecommunication lines. All methods must be used to cut off the enemy's front and rear lines of communication, eliminate traitors everywhere, restore the organs of people's power—the People's Committees—and actively assist the People's Army.

　　Compatriots in the southern half of the Republic must not obey the orders of the Syngman Rhee puppet government, and respond to its orders and instructions with sabotage in order to throw the enemy into chaos.

　　Workers in the southern half should organize general strikes everywhere, hold uprisings, and protect factories, workshops, mines, railways, and other workplaces to prevent destruction by the defeated enemy, welcome and actively assist the People's Army, and ensure victory.

　　Farmers in the southern half must not give food to the enemy, protect this year's harvest, and widely participate in the guerrilla movement. They should spare no effort to assist and support the People's Army.

　　Private enterprises, small and medium-sized industrialists, and merchants should assist the People's Army. In the struggle to liberate our national economy from the rule of American monopolistic capitalists, they should assist the People's Army.

　　Cultural figures and intellectuals in the southern half, for the sake of the unification and freedom of the fatherland, and in order to obtain the conditions to develop national culture, should assist the war against the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and actively participate in mass political propaganda, mercilessly exposing the crimes of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. They should play a role in propagating and mobilizing in the mass uprising movement.

　　Officers and soldiers of the "National Defense Army" of the South Korean puppet government: Your enemies are precisely the Syngman Rhee traitorous bandit gang. For the sake of the fatherland and the people, you must not miss the opportunity to turn your guns around and aim them at the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. You must go over to the side of the People's Army and the guerrillas, and assist the entire people's struggle to strive for the unification and freedom of the fatherland. Only by rising up against the enemies of our people can you obtain an honorable position in the ranks of the fighters for the freedom and independence of the fatherland.

　　Dear compatriots, brothers, and sisters: I call on all the Korean people to unite more closely around the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic in order to swiftly eliminate the military and police system of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. In order to strive for the unification of the fatherland, which is unanimously desired by our people, resolutely rise up to carry out the glorious victory of striving for and guaranteeing independence. The history of mankind tells us that the people who resolutely rise up to fight for freedom and independence will surely achieve victory.

　　Our people's cause is a just cause. Victory will surely belong to our people. I believe that our just struggle for the fatherland and the people will surely be victorious.

　　The time to unify our fatherland has come. With the confidence of victory, let us advance bravely! Let us dedicate all our strength to supporting our People's Army and the front lines. Let our people dedicate all their strength to eliminate the enemy.

　　Long live the Korean people who are fighting for the just war of all the people!
　　Long live the Korean Democratic People's Republic!
　　Forward for victory!

　　朝鲜共和国部长会议主席
    金日成将军发表广播演说
    号召全朝鲜人民一致奋起迅速消灭李承晚集团
    争取全朝鲜人民渴望的统一与独立的光荣胜利
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国部长会议主席金日成将军，于二十六日上午八时发表广播演说，痛斥李承晚匪帮在美帝指使下发动内战的罪恶行为并号召全朝鲜人民一致奋起，紧密地团结在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的周围，迅速消灭李承晚匪帮的武力与警察制度，以争取全朝鲜人民所一致渴望的祖国统一与独立的光荣胜利。演说全文如下：
    亲爱的同胞们！
    亲爱的兄弟姊妹们！
    人民军的军官和战士们！
    活跃在共和国南半部的游击队员们！
    我代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府向你们发出如下的号召：
    卖国贼李承晚的傀儡政府军队，于六月二十五日在三八线全线向以北地区发动了全面的进攻。勇敢的共和国警备队为抵抗敌人的进攻，展开了激烈的战斗，挫败了李承晚傀儡政府军队的进攻。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在讨论了当前的形势后，已命令我们的人民军开始反攻，消灭敌人的武装力量。
    人民军按照共和国政府的命令，已将三八线以北地区的敌军击退，而进入三八线以南十公里至十五公里了。人民军业已解放了瓮津、延安、白川（按均在黄海道）、开城（按在京畿道）等城市和许多村庄。
    我祖国的一切爱国民主力量虽然为争取以和平方式统一祖国而斗争，但是李承晚匪帮却发动了同族相争的内战来反对人民。如所周知，反对祖国和平统一的李承晚匪帮从很早以前就准备了同族相争的内战。南朝鲜人民虽然彷徨在饥饿线上，但李承晚傀儡政府却将从人民手中强迫征收得来的重税的大部分，浪费在军费的扩张和内战的准备上。李承晚反动派为了挑拨内战，疯狂地准备了坟墓。
    他们在南朝鲜树立反动警察制度，迫使一切民主政党与社会团体转入地下，并逮捕、监禁、残杀爱国的进步人士。任何人只要对李承晚的反动制度和他所准备着的内战稍表不满，就会横遭迫害。
    朝鲜人民不共戴天的仇敌——卖国贼李承晚，实施反人民的反动政策，对为祖国的独立、自由、民主发展而斗争的数十万我祖国的优秀儿女，加以监禁或虐杀。
    李承晚匪帮为了掩盖他们进行着的内战准备，继续不断地制造了三八线的冲突事件，致使祖国与人民陷于不安，并且企图把冲突事件的责任，嫁祸于我们人民共和国政府。李承晚匪帮在准备所谓“北伐”的过程中，甚至毫不犹疑地按照美帝国主义者的指示，和朝鲜人民的死敌——日本军阀勾结起来了。李承晚匪帮为了维持其一己的私利和反动统治，并使我祖国变为美帝国主义的殖民地和在亚洲的军事基地，变为美国独占资本家追求利润的泉源，竟把我祖国南半部的经济完全置于美国独占资本家的支配之下。
    美帝国主义者为在经济上使我祖国殖民地化，极力破坏了共和国南半部的民族经济。在美国资本的压迫下，中小企业家和商人不能不陷于破产的境地。在我们祖国的南半部，生产停顿，大部分的工厂和制作所倒闭，失业人数达数百万。农民直到现在尚未得到土地。人民彷徨在饥饿线上。
    亲爱的同胞们！朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府与我们祖国的所有爱国民主政党、社会团体及全体人民，为了避免同族相争的内战和流血的惨祸，曾尽了一切的努力，争取以和平方法统一我们的祖国。早在一九四八年四月，南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体代表的联席会议，即提出了和平统一我们国家的意愿。但是，李承晚匪帮破坏了这一意愿。李承晚匪帮在美帝国主义及其侵略工具所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”的支持下，于一九四八年五月十日捏造了南朝鲜的单独“选举”，并加强了对我们祖国北半部的武装进攻和准备。
    为了争取祖国的和平统一和完全独立，去年六月祖国战线旗帜下的南北朝鲜七十一个爱国政党与社会团体，曾提议以举行总选举的方法来和平统一我们的国家。全体朝鲜人民热烈地支持与拥护了这一提议，但李承晚匪徒们连这一提议也予以破坏了。
    一九五零年六月七日，祖国战线再度提出促进祖国和平统一的方案，反映了渴望祖国和平统一的朝鲜人民的意志。
    但是，李承晚匪帮威胁地说，凡对祖国战线的和平统一方案表示支持的人，将被认为是叛逆，因此这一方案又遭到了破坏。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会，于一九五零年六月十九日根据各民主政党社会团体要求祖国统一独立及民主发展的坚决意志与愿望，提议以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议与南朝鲜“国会”联合成立单一的全朝鲜立法机关的办法，来实现祖国的和平统一。
    李承晚匪帮怎样答复了全朝鲜人民所期望着的这一正当提议呢？
    背叛朝鲜人民利益的李承晚匪帮，以发动内战来回答了全朝鲜人民对祖国和平统一的期望。
    反动的匪徒们在他们所发动的内战中想达到什么样的目的呢？
    李承晚匪帮妄图通过内战，在共和国北半部也实施现存于南半部的、和日本帝国主义时代一般无二的反人民的反动统治制度，以夺取我们人民所业已取得的民主改革成果。李承晚匪帮妄图从由于共和国北半部根据无偿没收无偿分配原则实施土地改革的结果而成了土地主人的农民手中夺取土地，重新还给地主，并剥夺朝鲜人民在我共和国北半部所业已取得的一切民主自由和权利。李承晚匪帮妄图将我祖国变为美帝国主义的殖民地，而使朝鲜人民成为美帝国主义者的奴隶。（⑴⑷）
    亲爱的兄弟姊妹们：我祖国与人民面临着极大的危险。为了消除我祖国当前的危险需要怎样办呢？
    朝鲜人民在反对李承晚匪帮的这一战争中，必须坚决保卫朝鲜民主主义人民共和国及其宪法，推翻南半部反人民的法西斯的李承晚傀儡政权，将我祖国南半部从李承晚匪帮的统治下解放出来，并恢复南半部真正的人民政权——人民委员会。在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领导下，完成祖国统一，以建设强大的民主独立国家。我们为反对李承晚卖国匪帮所发动的内战而进行的战争，乃是争取祖国统一独立自由与民主的正义战争。
    亲爱的同胞们：全体朝鲜人民如不愿再一次成为外国帝国主义的奴隶，就应该在打倒李承晚卖国匪帮的救国斗争中一致奋起，不惜任何牺牲，争取胜利。全体朝鲜人民对站在李承晚匪帮背后的美帝国主义的一举一动应加以密切注视，提高警惕性。
    我们人民军应坚守共和国北半部的各种民主改革，从反动统治下拯救南半部同胞，并在人民共和国的旗帜下，在为祖国统一的斗争中，发挥我们的勇敢及创造性。为了祖国和人民，应不惜自己的生命，竭尽爱国忠诚，斗争到最后的一滴血。
    我们人民军的军官和战士们，是从人民中来的，是由祖国和人民的优秀儿女组成的。他们是以爱国爱人民的精神培养出来的，以最新式的现代精锐武器装备起来的。他们是有经常为祖国为人民的利益而斗争的高度觉悟的朝鲜人民的军队。
    共和国北半部人民，应把自己的一切事业，改编为战时形态。为了在短期间内无情地歼灭扫荡敌人，要动员一切的力量。应使一切工作，服从于战争和歼灭敌人的任务。应组织全国人民对人民军的援助，源源不绝地供应前线，供给他们一切必需品，保障军需品的紧急输送。对于伤兵要组织广泛的热爱的救护工作。应组织能圆满完成前线供应、巩固人民军后方的一切工作。
    在后方要与捣乱分子及造谣分子作无情的斗争，应迅速展开肃清特务破坏分子的工作。敌人是狡猾的阴险的，它必将以各种方法散布谣言，我们不要被反动的宣传所欺骗。共和国政权机关，应消灭一切妨害全人民进行争取统一自由独立的战争的破坏分子。
    共和国北半部的工人、技术人员和职员，要以高度的警惕性防止敌人的侵害，以保护共和国的一切工厂、制作所、铁道及运输、交通、邮电、机关，要忠实地执行生产计划和自己所负的任务，要以献身的努力，来及时地迅速地保障前线的需要。
    共和国北半部农民，要为保障人民军的食粮并更多地生产农作物而努力。同时，为保障人民军的胜利，应在各方面尽力予以援助。
    共和国南半部男女游击队员们，应展开更激烈的英勇的游击运动，争取广大的人民群众参加游击队，扩大与建立解放区，并在敌人后方歼灭敌人，破坏敌人的作战计划，袭击敌人参谋部，切断并破坏铁道、公路、桥梁及电信电话线等。要以一切方法截断敌人前后方的联络，到处消灭卖国者，恢复人民政权机关——人民委员会，同时积极协助人民军。
    共和国南半部同胞不要服从李承晚傀儡政府的命令，以怠工来回答其命令与指示，使敌人陷于混乱。
    南半部工人应到处组织总罢工，举行起义，并应保护工厂、制作所、矿山、铁道及其他工作场所，防止溃败的敌人的破坏，欢迎与积极协助人民军，以保障胜利。
    南半部农民，不要给敌人粮食，保卫今年的收获物，广泛地参加游击队运动。应不惜一切来协助与支援人民军。
    私人企业、中小工业家及商人，应援助人民军。在从美国独占资本家的统治下解放我们民族经济的斗争中，应援助人民军。
    南半部的文化人知识分子，为了祖国的统一自由，并为取得能以发展民族文化的条件，应协助反对李承晚匪帮的战争，并应积极参加大众的政治宣传行列，无情地揭露李承晚匪帮的罪行。在群众性的起义运动中，起宣传鼓动的作用。
    南朝鲜傀儡政府的“国防军”官兵们：你们的仇敌正是李承晚卖国匪帮。为了祖国与人民，你们不要错过机会，应掉转枪口，瞄准李承晚匪帮。你们要转到人民军和游击队这方面来，协助争取祖国统一自由的全人民的斗争。你们只有起来反对我们人民的仇敌，才能在为祖国的自由独立的斗士的行列中，取得荣誉的地位。
    亲爱的同胞、兄弟、姊妹们：我号召全朝鲜人民要更紧密地团结在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的周围，以迅速消灭李承晚匪帮的武力与警察制度。为了争取我们人民所一致渴望的祖国统一，坚决奋起进行争取与保障独立的光荣的胜利。人类的历史告诉我们：坚决奋起进行争取自由独立斗争的人民，必能取得胜利。
    我们人民的事业是正义的事业。胜利是一定属于我们人民方面的。我相信：我们为祖国与人民的正义斗争一定胜利。
    统一我祖国的时机到来了，怀着胜利信心勇敢地前进吧！让我们在支援我们的人民军和前线中，献出我们的一切力量。让我们人民要献出一切力量来消灭敌人。
    为全人民的正义战争而奋斗的朝鲜人民万岁！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    为争取胜利前进！
