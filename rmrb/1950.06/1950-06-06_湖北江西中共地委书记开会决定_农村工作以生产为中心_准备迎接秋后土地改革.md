Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 29th—The rent reduction work in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces has been largely completed. The central task of rural work in the two provinces from now on is to do a good job in production and actively prepare for land reform after the autumn harvest. The CCP Provincial Committees of the two provinces held joint meetings of regional committee secretaries this month and made the above decisions on rural work in their respective provinces.

The joint meeting of the CCP Hubei Provincial Committee secretaries summarized the achievements of the province's past rural work as follows: Rent reduction has been carried out in accordance with the law in 90 percent of the province's areas. Farmers have recovered more than 200 million catties of rent grain from rent reduction. Coupled with measures such as grain loans from the Provincial People's Government, work-for-relief programs, and assistance to sideline production, the province has successfully overcome the spring famine. The meeting decided that before August this year, the province will focus on doing a good job in rural production, further eliminate bandits, implement rent reduction review, consolidate peasant ranks, train cadres, actively prepare to welcome land reform after the autumn harvest, and effectively complete the summer grain requisition.

The joint meeting of the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Committee secretaries pointed out that rent reduction movements have been launched in 60 percent of the areas in Jiangxi Province, and farmers have reduced rent grain by about 500,000 dan. The production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants has been generally improved as a result. More than 10 million mu of early rice have been planted throughout the province, and nearly 300,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. Various water conservancy projects in the province were also completed before the spring ploughing, completing more than 10 million cubic meters of earthwork and building more than 10,000 flood control and drought prevention projects such as weirs and ponds. The meeting decided that in the next three months, the focus of rural work in the province will be on further mobilizing the masses, completing production plans, and preparing for land reform. The meeting stipulated three specific tasks: to further launch rural social reform movements with leadership, policies, and preparation, according to the different conditions of different regions; to concentrate all efforts to strive not to reduce the level of agricultural production in 1949, and to ensure the completion of the province's task of increasing grain production by 5 million dan this year; and to vigorously train rural cadres and thoroughly overcome the work styles of commandism, bureaucratism, and empiricism existing among some cadres.

　　湖北江西中共地委书记开会决定
    农村工作以生产为中心  准备迎接秋后土地改革
    【新华社汉口二十九日电】湖北、江西两省的减租工作已大部完成，今后两省农村工作的中心任务为作好生产，积极准备在秋后进行土地改革。两省中共省委会本月中曾分别召开地委书记联席会议，对于两省的农村工作分别作出了上述的决定。
    湖北省中共地委书记联席会议关于该省过去农村工作的成绩曾概要总结如下：全省已在百分之九十的地区依法进行了减租。农民从减租中共收回租谷达二亿余万斤，加上省人民政府贷粮贷款，以工代赈，扶助副业生产等措施，该省春荒已顺利度过。会议决定：本年八月以前，该省将以做好农村生产工作为中心，进一步肃清土匪，贯彻减租进行复查，整顿农民队伍，训练干部，积极准备迎接秋后土地改革，并切实完成夏征。
    江西省中共地委书记联席会议指出：江西全省已有十分之六的地区展开了减租运动，农民减回租粮约五十万担。广大农民的生产情绪已因此而普遍提高，全省一千余万亩早禾已栽种完毕，并开垦荒地近三十万亩。该省各项水利工程也已于春耕前全部竣工，完成土方一千万公方以上，兴修堰坝池塘等防洪防旱工程万余处。会议决定：今后三个月该省农村工作将以进一步发动群众，完成生产计划，准备实行土地改革为中心。会议规定了三项具体任务，即：根据不同地区的不同情况，有领导、有政策、有准备地进一步发动农村社会改革运动；集中全力争取不降低一九四九年的农业生产水平，保证完成全省今年增产粮食五百万担的任务；大力整训农村干部，彻底克服某些干部中存在着的命令主义、官僚主义、经验主义等作风。
