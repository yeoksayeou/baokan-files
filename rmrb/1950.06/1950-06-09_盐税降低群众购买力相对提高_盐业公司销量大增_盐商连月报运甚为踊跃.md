　　Salt Tax Reduction Relatively Increases Mass Purchasing Power
　　Salt Company Sales Greatly Increase
　　Salt Merchants' Consecutive Monthly Reporting of Shipments is Very Enthusiastic
　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Since the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council announced a 50% reduction in salt tax, the purchasing power of the masses for salt in various regions has relatively increased, and the sales volume of the China Salt Industry Company has increased. According to incomplete statistics from the China Salt Industry Company, from June 1st to June 3rd, the national daily average salt sales reached 64,000 dan, an increase of 3.2 times compared to the daily sales of 20,000 dan before the salt tax reduction. The feedback from various regions is also good. Salt transporters in Tianjin believe that after the reduction of the salt tax, the phenomenon of local salt disrupting the market can be avoided, and the future is promising. Therefore, salt merchants have been enthusiastically reporting shipments in recent days. On June 2nd alone, salt merchants in Tianjin reported shipments of more than 6,800 dan of salt to the China Salt Industry Company. Transporters who had not registered in the past and were preparing to quit are also requesting permission to complete registration and prepare to resume transportation and sales operations. The salt sales volume in Beijing, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou has also increased significantly, and the number of salt vendors is also increasing. The general public said, "Lu salt is cheaper, and we will no longer eat local salt." Sauce garden businesses said, "The salt tax has been reduced, and the price is cheaper, so we can sell more goods and do more business."

　　盐税降低群众购买力相对提高
  　盐业公司销量大增
    盐商连月报运甚为踊跃
    【本报讯】自中央人民政府政务院财经委员会公布盐税减低一半后，各地群众对食盐的购买力已相对提高，中国盐业公司的销盐额已有增加。据中国盐业公司不完全统计，六月一日至三日，全国每日平均销盐达六万四千担，比较盐税未减前之日销二万担，增加了三·二倍。各地的反映亦均属良好。天津的食盐运商认为盐税减低后，可以避免土盐冲销现象之发生，前途大有希望。因而连日来盐商报运踊跃，仅六月二日一天中，津市运商向中国盐业公司办理报运食盐即达六千八百余担；过去未登记而准备不干的运商亦都在请求准予补行登记，准备恢复运销业务。北京、保定、张家口各地销盐数量均有显著增加，盐贩亦在增多。一般市民都说：“芦盐便宜了，将不再吃土盐了。”酱园业则称：“盐税降低，价钱便宜，我们也可多销货，多做买卖了。”
