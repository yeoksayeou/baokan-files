Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Huang Yanpei, convener of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, delivered a speech at the second meeting of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 17th. The full text is as follows:

　　Since the first meeting, only eight months have passed, and the international and domestic situations have made great progress. Internationally, the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing in strength, the market for warmongers is shrinking, and international peace has better guarantees. Domestically, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the united front is broader and more solid. The expanded representation of the people attending this meeting and the enthusiastic atmosphere of the meeting are enough to prove this. The construction of people's democratic power has rapidly unfolded in various places, and most cities and counties have already held people's representative conferences from all walks of life. The heroic People's Liberation Army has basically liberated all of China, leaving only Taiwan and Tibet to be liberated; at the same time, it has also shattered the enemy's blockade of our coast. In terms of foreign affairs, we have established truly friendly and extremely strong diplomatic relations with fraternal countries, and have taken the initiative in the struggle against imperialism. This is a great contribution to world peace and also provides a strong guarantee for China's internal construction. The financial and economic work has made amazing achievements. In a short period of time, it has achieved a near balance of revenue and expenditure and a general stability of prices, eliminated the monetary disaster that has lasted for twelve years, and arranged a strong foundation for the construction of the new country. In addition, the Chinese people have completely overcome serious natural disasters with their own strength; in the midst of financial difficulties, they have completed unprecedentedly huge water conservancy projects; the efforts in industrial and mining construction and cultural and educational construction are also greater than in any previous period. These are all things that everyone should be happy about.

　　Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out that the Chinese nation loves peace and freedom, and that New China needs to heal the wounds of war and carry out economic, political, cultural, and national defense construction. The work of the past eight months has proved that we are already doing this, and doing it quite well. Of course, the progress of various constructions must have a center. In the next stage, the central goal that our people nationwide should strive for is "to strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation," as Chairman Mao pointed out. The central topic of this meeting is also this.

　　There are three conditions for striving for a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation: the completion of land reform, the adjustment of industry and commerce, and a large reduction in the expenditure of state organs. To realize these three conditions, we must first consolidate the unification of financial and economic work, consolidate the balance of financial revenue and expenditure, and consolidate the stability of prices. What Chairman Mao and Vice Premier Chen Yun have told us is completely correct. We members of the Democratic National Construction Association unanimously support this policy.

　　We completely agree with Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the issue of land reform. He instructed us on how to faithfully and properly implement the relevant provisions of the Common Program regarding land reform. That is: we must focus on production and preserve the rich peasant economy; we must act in accordance with policies and laws to prevent the occurrence of chaotic phenomena. This guarantees that future land reform work can be done better than in the past, and can achieve greater results. After the completion of land reform, not only can agricultural production be greatly developed, but it also opens the way for industrialization. The draft land reform law proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is rich and thorough, and after everyone's discussion and modification, it will surely be further improved.

　　The adjustment of industry and commerce mainly lies in adjusting the relationship between public and private sectors, and the method of adjustment is also completely based on the Common Program. When industry and commerce shift from an abnormal inflationary situation to a normal price stability situation, due to the disappearance of false prosperity, they will inevitably encounter great difficulties. However, for the masses, this is obviously a great thing; for the future of industry and commerce, it is also a great joy. After this adjustment, industry and commerce can get on the right track and move towards brightness. But the main thing still depends on self-reliance, and one cannot rely on the government alone. The government will, of course, do everything possible to take care of private industry and commerce. However, the government must never harm the stability that has already been achieved in order to take care of private industry and commerce. Therefore, each industrial and commercial unit must correctly manage its own business guidelines, must reasonably manage its own organization, and must also improve labor-management relations through consultation; more importantly, it must firmly trust the Common Program, be familiar with the Common Program, sincerely accept the leadership of the state-owned economy, enthusiastically support all methods of adjusting industry and commerce, actively pay the taxes that should be paid, and cherish and help tax collectors.

　　We cannot be complacent about the near balance of financial revenue and expenditure, we must further strive for a greater proportion of financial expenditure to be used in construction. Therefore, it is completely necessary to reduce the expenditure of state organs. But this also requires everyone's joint efforts. In streamlining, saving, and budgeting carefully, we must learn from the Communist Party of China. In the work of demobilizing the army, we must do our best and be jointly responsible for solving the problems of the demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns and finding employment.

　　In this way, in the financial and economic aspects, from consolidating the achievements of unity and stability that have already been achieved, gradually striving for a fundamental improvement, the steps are solid and the methods are effective. The glorious victories of the past are enough to guarantee greater victories in the future. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we will all work together, and at the next meeting, we will definitely hear reports that will make everyone even more excited. I sincerely extend the greatest respect on behalf of the Democratic National Construction Association to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao who lead us, and I wish all members and comrades good health, and wish the meeting a complete success.

    黄炎培在大会上的发言
    【新华社二十日讯】中国民主建国会常务委员会召集人黄炎培在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议十七日的大会上的发言，全文于下：
    从第一次会议到现在，仅仅八个多月时间，国际和国内的形势，都有了很大的进步。在国际，以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵线声势日大，战争贩子的市场萎缩了，国际和平有了更好的保障。在国内，由于中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，统一战线是更加广泛而且更加稳固了，这次参加会议人选代表性的阔大和开会情况的热烈，很够证明了这一点。人民民主政权的建设，迅速地在各地方展开，大多数市县已经开过了各界人民代表会议。英勇无比的人民解放军已经基本地解放了全中国，只留下台湾和西藏还待解放；同时还粉碎了敌人对我海岸的封锁。在外交方面，和兄弟国家缔结了真正友好而且极其坚强的邦交，对帝国主义的斗争完全取得了主动。这对于世界和平是一个很大的贡献，对于中国内部建设，也增加了有力的保障。财经工作有了惊人的成绩，在短短期间之内，做到了收支的接近平衡和物价的大体稳定，扫除了绵延十二年的货币灾祸，安排好了新国家建设的有力基础。此外，中国人民还完全用自己的力量战胜了严重的天灾；在财政困难当中，完成了空前巨大的水利工程；在工矿建设和文教建设上的努力，也较过去任何时期为大。这些都是值得大家高兴的。
    毛主席已经一再地指出，中华民族是爱好和平自由的，新中国需要治好战争创伤，进行经济、政治、文化、国防的建设。过去八个多月的工作证明我们已经在这样做，而且做得相当好。当然，各种建设的进行，必须有一个中心。今后一个阶段，我们全国人民所应该努力的中心目标，便是毛主席所指出的“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”。这次会议的中心课题，也正在此。
    争取财经状况基本好转的条件有三个：土改的完成，工商业的调整，和国家机构经费支出的大量节减。要实现这三个条件，还先得巩固财经工作的统一，巩固财政收支的平衡，和巩固物价的稳定。毛主席和陈云副总理所告诉我们的是完全正确的。我们民建会同人一致拥护这种政策。
    我们完全同意刘少奇副主席关于土地改革问题的报告。他指示我们应该如何忠实而妥善地执行共同纲领有关土改的规定。那就是：必须着眼于生产、保存富农经济；必须依据政策和法令，防止混乱现象的发生。这就保证了今后的土改工作，可以做得比过去更加好，而且可以收得更大的效果。土改完成之后，不但农业生产可以大大发展，同时也为工业化开辟了道路。中共中央所提出的土地改革法草案内容是丰富而周密的，经过大家的讨论修改之后，一定可以更臻完善。
    工商业的调整，主要是在调整公私关系，调整的办法也是完全根据共同纲领的。工商业在从不正常的通货膨胀局面，转入正常的通货稳定局面的时候，由于虚伪繁荣的消失，不可避免的要遭遇到很大的困难。可是，为大众想，这显然是一件天大的好事；为工商业前途想，也是一件天大的喜事。工商业经过了这一次的调整，就可以转入正轨，走向光明。但主要的仍靠自力更生，不能一味依赖政府，政府当然竭尽一切可能，来照顾私营工商业的。但是，政府绝对不能为着照顾私营工商业而伤害了已经获得了的稳定。所以，各工商业单位必须正确地自己搞好业务方针，必须合理地自己搞好本身组织，还要通过协商，搞好劳资关系；更重要的，必须坚决信任共同纲领，熟习共同纲领，诚心诚意地接受国营经济的领导，热烈的拥护调整工商业的一切办法，踊跃地缴纳应当缴纳的捐税，爱护并帮助征税人员。
    我们不能自满于财政收支的接近平衡，我们必须进一步争取在财政支出当中，有更大的成份用在建设。因此，节减国家机构的经费支出是完全必要的。但这也需要大家的共同努力。在精简节约和精打细算上面，我们必须向中共看齐。在军队复员工作上，我们必须尽心竭力，共同负责来解决复员军人的还乡、就业等问题。
    这样，在财经方面，从巩固既经得到的统一和稳定的成绩，逐步争取基本的好转，步骤是踏实的、方法是有效的。过去的辉煌胜利，足够保证将来的更大的胜利。我们大家在中共和毛主席领导之下，一齐努力，下一次会议，一定可以听到使得大家更加兴奋的报告。我很诚恳地代表民主建国会向领导我们的中国共产党和毛主席致最大的敬意，恭祝诸位委员、诸位同志的健康，预祝会议的圆满成功。
