Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 31st: Due to the earnest implementation of the temporary agreement by both labor and management, most of the privately-owned machine dyeing and finishing factories in Tianjin have approached a balance in income and expenditure, basically overcoming their temporary difficulties. There were originally forty-four (previously mistakenly reported as forty-seven) privately-owned machine dyeing and finishing factories. In order to assist the capitalists in overcoming temporary difficulties, the industry's employees signed a "Temporary Agreement to Overcome Difficulties" with the capitalists on May 6th. Each factory also signed specific agreements based on their specific circumstances and the spirit of the industry agreement. As of now, more than twenty factories in the industry, including Tianhe, Changxingcheng, and Xintai, have signed temporary agreements, and more than ten factories, including Xinfeng, are in the process of negotiating.

In the factories that have signed temporary agreements, due to the earnest implementation of the agreements by both labor and management, coupled with the support of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company supplying the industry with more than 34,000 bolts of dyeing work in May, the factories' expenses have been greatly reduced, moving from losses towards a balance in income and expenditure. Some factories have even begun to profit. For example, Tianhe Dyeing Factory's monthly wages, food, and other expenses totaled more than 20,000 jin of millet in value. In April, due to limited work, they were two months behind in paying workers' wages and had debts of more than 50 million yuan. Changxingcheng Dyeing Factory also faced a similar situation of income not covering expenses, owing workers' wages for as long as three months. In order to overcome these difficulties, labor and management at both factories, based on the spirit of the industry agreement, specifically stipulated wage reductions and a system of employees taking turns staying at home. The result of the implementation over the past twenty days has been a significant reduction in the factories' expenses, making up for the losses. Tianhe Dyeing Factory saved 2.21 million yuan in food costs alone each month; Changxingcheng saved the equivalent of 17,000 jin of cornmeal in wage expenses in May. Recently, both factories have seen an increase in dyeing work, and their business situation has gradually improved. In May, Tianhe Dyeing Factory not only paid the workers one month's back wages but also paid off the 50 million yuan in external debt. Other dyeing factories, such as Fangda, Tianshengfu, Yichang, and Yihua, have also significantly reduced expenses and increased profits due to the earnest implementation of the agreements, enabling production to be maintained.

In the process of assisting capitalists in overcoming temporary difficulties and implementing temporary agreements, the employees of each factory not only voluntarily reduced their wages and benefits appropriately but also actively worked to improve the quantity and quality of products, playing a significant role in reducing product costs. For example, Fangda Dyeing Factory previously had fifteen workers dyeing 160 bolts of cloth per day, but now ten workers staying at the factory also dye 160 bolts of cloth per day. After Tongshunhe Dyeing Factory secured dyeing work, the workers voluntarily increased their working hours from ten to twelve hours, which increased the daily output from 140 bolts to 200 bolts. In terms of product quality, Changxingcheng used to produce about 100 bolts of defective cloth each month, but in May, not a single bolt of defective cloth was produced.

The employees' practical actions of self-restraint in reducing wages and benefits and actively engaging in production have greatly boosted the capitalists' confidence in management. Currently, many capitalists in the industry are actively improving management methods and unreasonable systems. For example, the manager of Tongshunhe not only personally went to the streets to solicit work but also selected four capable employees to travel around various public and private enterprises to undertake dyeing work all day long. In addition to undertaking 4,000 bolts of dyeing work from the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the factory recently contracted 100 bolts of dyeing work per day from private merchants, allowing for continuous production for more than twenty days. Due to the increasing amount of dyeing work and the continuous improvement of output and quality, the factory has a significant business surplus. The capitalist of the factory not only hired four temporary workers on May 25th but also announced to the employees on the 28th the cancellation of the 50% wage reduction agreement, restoring the employees' full wages, which further boosted the workers' production enthusiasm. On the 29th, the output increased by another forty bolts. In this way, the factory truly realized the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and management. The capitalist of Changxingcheng Dyeing Factory also voluntarily abolished the unreasonable system of nine shareholders nominally receiving salaries. The manager of the factory not only personally went out to solicit work but also participated in the work of arranging cloth.

Currently, except for a few factories such as Xinfeng, which are still in a state of partial shutdown due to less dyeing work, most factories have basically overcome their difficulties. In the future, with the increasing processing work from state-owned trade departments and the beginning of activity in the cloth market, the factories in the industry can embark on a path of normal development.

### 劳资认真执行协定·花纱布公司大力扶植  天津染整业大部已度过暂时困难

　　劳资认真执行协定·花纱布公司大力扶植
    天津染整业大部已度过暂时困难
    【新华社天津三十一日电】由于劳资双方认真执行临时协定，津市私营机器染整业大部分工厂收支已接近平衡，基本上度过了暂时困难。私营机器染整业原有工厂四十四家（前误为四十七家）。该业职工为协助资方克服暂时困难，曾于五月六日与资方签订了“克服困难临时协定”，各厂又根据具体情况及行业协定精神，签订了具体协议。截至目前，该业中已签订了临时协定的有天河、长兴成、信泰等二十余厂，信丰等十余厂正在协议中。
    在签订了临时协定的工厂中，由于劳资双方认真执行了协定，加以花纱布公司五月间供给该业三万四千多匹染活加以扶植，各厂开支大减，由亏累走向收支平衡，有些工厂并已开始获利。如天河染厂过去每月工资、伙食及其他开支共折小米两万余斤，四月间因开工很少，积欠工人两个月工资，并负债五千余万元。长兴成染厂也因入不敷出，积欠工人工资达三个月。该两厂劳资双方为克服困难，即根据行业协定精神，具体规定了减薪及职工轮流住家办法，二十天来执行的结果，两厂开支大减，弥补了亏累数字。天河染厂每月只伙食费一项即节省二百二十一万元；长兴成五月份即节省了工资开支折玉米面一万七千斤。近来该两厂染活日多，营业情况逐渐好转。五月份天河染厂除补发了工人一月欠资外，并已将五千万元的外债付清。其它如方大、天生福、义昌、益华等染厂，也都由于认真执行了协定，开支大减，利润增多，使生产得以维持。
    在协助资方克服暂时困难及执行临时协定中，各厂职工不仅主动将工资、福利待遇适当减低，更以积极劳动，提高产品的数量与质量，对减低产品成本起了巨大作用。如方大染厂过去十五个工人日染布百六十匹，现在十个留厂工人亦日染百六十匹。同顺合染厂自揽到染活后，工人自动由十小时工作增到十二小时，因此使日产量由一百四十匹增至二百匹。在产品质量上，长兴成过去每月常出残布百匹左右，而五月份未出一匹残布。
    该业职工克己减薪、减低待遇与积极生产的实际行动，大大鼓舞了各厂资方的经营信心。现在该业中不少资方正在积极改善经营方法和不合理的制度。如同顺和经理除自己亲自下街揽活外，还选派了四个得力职员终日奔走各公、私营企业承揽染活。该厂最近除承揽花纱布公司四千匹染活外，每天能承揽私营客商染活一百匹，可继续生产二十余日。由于该厂染活日增，产量与质量的不断提高，营业大有盈余。现该厂资方除于五月二十五日增雇四名临时工外，并于二十八日向职工宣布取消减薪百分之五十的协议，恢复职工全部工薪，因而工人生产情绪更加高涨，二十九日即又增加产量四十匹。这样，该厂就真正实现了发展生产、劳资两利的方针。长兴成染厂资方也自动取消了九个股东挂名领薪的不合理制度。该厂经理不仅亲自出外揽活，还参加整布工作。
    目前该业中除信丰等少数工厂因染活较少尚在半停工状态外，大部工厂已基本上度过了困难。今后随着国营贸易部门加工活的日益增多及纱布市场的开始活跃，该业各厂即可步入正常发展的轨道。
