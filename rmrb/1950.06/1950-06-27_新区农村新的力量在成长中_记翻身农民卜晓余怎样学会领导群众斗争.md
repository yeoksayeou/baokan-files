　　New Forces are Growing in the Rural Areas of the New District
    ——On How Turned-Over Peasant Bu Xiaoyu Learned to Lead the Masses' Struggle
    By Our Correspondent Li Wen

    This spring, a large-scale social reform movement unfolded in the rural areas of Hunan. Over ten million peasants were involved in the struggle for rent reduction and the clearing of accumulated grain (most villages in Hunan had voluntary granaries collected by peasants, which were mostly controlled, embezzled, or used for personal gain by landlords before liberation); 5,730,000 peasants participated in the organization of peasant associations; and hundreds of thousands of turned-over activists were elected as representatives to attend peasant representative conferences at all levels. The growth of this immense force has created extremely favorable conditions for the land reform movement that will begin after the autumn harvest.

    Bu Xiaoyu, the chairman of the Qing Shixiang (administrative village) Farmers' Association in Yiyang District 5 and a representative to the First Hunan Provincial Farmers' Congress, is one of these thousands of turned-over activists.

  From Hardship to Liberation
    Bu Xiaoyu helped his parents farm for landlords when he was a child, and became a long-term laborer when he grew up. He is now twenty-seven years old. Bu Xiaoyu's father made a living by selling firewood. He saved diligently, accumulating 300 strings of copper coins (worth 100 piculs of grain at the time) as a deposit, before he could rent three piculs of land from landlord Zou Hongcai. The annual yield was 81 piculs, but he had to pay 54 piculs in rent, and also do odd jobs for the landlord for free. He also had to send chickens and gifts during festivals. In 1945, the landlord, with ulterior motives, not only converted the original deposit of 300 strings of copper coins into 60 silver dollars but also demanded an additional 40 silver dollars as a deposit. His father barely managed to scrape together the deposit by begging friends and relatives. But before long, the landlord used the excuse that he owed seven piculs of rent to forcefully terminate the lease. His pleas were in vain, and the lease was finally terminated. When clearing the deposit, the landlord used his word as proof and insisted that one silver dollar was worth ten piculs of grain (the market price was three yuan), and also deducted two piculs of rent arrears. More than a hundred piculs of grain went into the landlord’s coffers, leaving only eight piculs when they left the village. Bu Xiaoyu was furious, but in the old society, the landlords were rich and powerful, and he could only swallow his hatred and anger.

    After the lease was terminated, his father and his three younger brothers split up the family, and he received one picul of self-cultivated land. He had a wife and children, so how could he make a living? He had no choice but to borrow some high-interest loans and do some small business. From October of that year to September of the following year, the debts forced him to find a job as a long-term laborer at landlord Jia Zicai's house, tilling five piculs and five dou of land. In addition to the field work, he had to feed pigs, pound rice, do chores, and weave bamboo. He even had to carry sedan chairs. Even if he was busy transplanting rice seedlings, he had to rush to carry the chair at the slightest call, and the field work had to be done on time. In April 1947, after he had finished Jia Zicai's "Yangchun" (spring production), Jia found another worker who was willing to work for a lower price and fired him. Without a job as a long-term laborer, there was nothing to eat. In December, he asked his father-in-law to vouch for him and entered the gate of wealthy peasant Jia Runjiang (his uncle's wife's nephew). The rich man did not see him as a poor relative. If he was late for work by one day, his wages were deducted by two piculs of grain. Last April, after just finishing "Yangchun", Jia Runjiang fired him again. Bu Xiaoyu had no choice but to learn to make bamboo hats and brooms to make a living, while his wife took the children to beg for food.

    Bu Xiaoyu hated the landlords. He had heard the elders say, "In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, Yiyang organized a peasant association to fight the landlords and distribute the land. Later, the peasant association was forced to disband, and the Communist Party and the Red Army marched north." He wholeheartedly hoped for the return of the Red Army.

    Last June, while he was selling brooms in Yiyang City, he heard that the People's Liberation Army had captured Wuhan. He couldn't sleep all night when he returned home. On August 3rd, the People's Liberation Army liberated Yiyang City. He was so excited that he couldn't stay at home. He picked up his brooms and went to the city to welcome the People's Liberation Army. Bad elements threatened him: "The People's Liberation Army is conscripting people in the city, you will definitely suffer if you go." Xiaoyu thought: "The People's Liberation Army is fighting the Kuomintang to save the poor, they certainly won't." When he entered the city, he saw that the People's Liberation Army was fair in buying and selling, treating people kindly, and warmly greeting him, asking him about his life. It reminded him that two years ago, when he went to the city to sell charcoal, he put down his load on the street to take a breather, and a puppet policeman rushed up and beat him up, kicking the charcoal all over the street. He grabbed the hand of a comrade from the People's Liberation Army and was so excited that he couldn't speak.

  Firm Stand, Strong Backbone
    Last October, the People's Government called on everyone to reclaim wasteland for production. Bad elements wanted to elect Chen Botai, a loafer who had been a puppet head of the bao, as the leader of the production team. Bu Xiaoyu was so anxious that he felt a fire in his heart. He stood up and spoke to everyone: "The People's Liberation Army and the Communist Party are working for the benefit of our people. They are calling on us to reclaim wasteland for production, so we must elect someone who knows how to produce. Chen Botai is idle and lazy, how can he lead us in production?" At that time, the arrogance of the landlords and bad elements had not yet been suppressed, and the masses did not dare to speak out publicly, but they nodded in agreement. Under the manipulation of the bad elements, Chen Botai was elected as the leader, and Bu Xiaoyu was elected as the deputy leader.

    Later, Chen Botai and Bao Chief Zhao Boyang discussed with the landlords and decided that having Bu Xiaoyu as a village cadre would be an obstacle and inconvenient, so they threatened the masses and forced the removal of Bu Xiaoyu. Bu Xiaoyu did not lose heart. He went to District Chief Zhang in the district to report the situation in the village. The district chief said, "You are wholeheartedly for the masses, so why were you voted out?" Xiaoyu said, "Taking advantage of the fact that the common people had all gone to the mountains to cut firewood, Chen Botai held an election meeting. Out of more than 2,600 people in the village, less than 160 people attended, and some of the poor peasants who attended went home without voting." District cadres went to Qing Shixiang to understand the situation, convened a village-wide peasant meeting, explained the policies, and held a new election. Bu Xiaoyu was elected as the leader, and poor peasant Duan Lianhua was elected as the deputy leader. Chen Botai was voted out.

    Bu Xiaoyu led the masses to settle accounts with the Bao chief, clearing out more than 1,200 catties of excess public grain, buying two piculs and five and a half dou of buckwheat seeds, and 300 catties of potatoes, which were lent to farmers who lacked seeds.

    The landlords saw that Bu Xiaoyu's stand was firm and his backbone was strong. Threats didn't work, so they tried to bribe him with soft tactics. Landlord Jia Yusheng came to his house late at night and secretly gave him three gold rings. He took them and sneered: "Don't dream of bribing me, I'll write down a rent refund for you. Go back and tell others, it should be as much as the government orders, and rent reduction must be thorough." The next day, Xiaoyu announced the landlord's gift of gold, and the peasants happily said: "How can Chen Botai and Zhao Boyang be of one heart with us, it's still better to elect our own people, who can do things for everyone."

  Learning Policies, Learning Skills
    At the end of February this year, Bu Xiaoyu and seven other peasant representatives went to the district to participate in the district peasant representative conference. The main purpose of this meeting was to discuss the policies and methods of organizing peasant associations and carrying out rent reduction and clearing accumulated grain. Bu Xiaoyu saw that some representatives were not studying seriously, so he criticized them: "If you don't learn the policies well and can't remember them, how will you do your work when you return to the village!" He himself was very serious in studying the problems in his work. At one discussion, he raised a question: the government is calling on the masses to produce and reclaim wasteland, but the poor peasants in the village say "reclaiming wasteland is good, but I have nothing to eat right now", and the public doesn't have much grain, so what should we do? He raised this question to encourage everyone to discuss it. He had already figured out how to reduce the rent for large and small plots of land, and how to refund the rent, but he continued to think: "Should the rent from land leased by middle peasants be refunded as well? How should I publicize it to the poor peasants when I return to the village?" If he couldn't figure it out, he would ask the district cadres.

    Because he was willing to use his brain, his academic performance was good, and he remembered the policies clearly, he had ways to do his work.

  Growing in the Movement
    The eight peasant representatives returned from the district conference and developed members after several days of propaganda. The peasant association was officially established on March 5th, and Bu Xiaoyu was elected as the chairman.

    When rent reduction began, although the policies had been publicized repeatedly, many tenant middle peasants were still not active. Bu Xiaoyu talked to several tenant middle peasants to understand their thoughts: "They are afraid that the rent grain refunded will be confiscated by the peasant association." Bu Xiaoyu assured them: "The rent refunded will never be confiscated and forcibly distributed by the peasant association." At the same time, he also carried out "one family" education: "Poor peasants and tenant peasants are one family, if we are not of one heart, the rent will not be reduced. There is a spring famine right now, you have something to eat, but you can't bear to let your poor peasant brothers starve! You should give up some of the fruits of the rent refund." At the same time, he patiently persuaded the poor peasants who wanted to divide the rent grain equally: the rent grain is the tenant peasants' blood and sweat, it is wrong to divide it equally; if the family is not united, the landlords will have loopholes to exploit.

    Because the policies were well implemented, the whole village's enthusiasm for production was high. Most families transplanted rice seedlings earlier than last year, the fertilizer increased by one-third compared to last year, and more than 300 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, and more than ten mu of paddy fields were added. Middle peasants are also discussing giving the peasant association a five-star national flag and a association flag to express their support.

  A Fine Story
    In the first two months of Bu Xiaoyu's participation in the work, his wife, Jia Daoying, had some old ideas and often complained that he could not make money and was busy in the village all day long. Even when Bu Xiaoyu came home late from the meeting at night, she deliberately made things difficult for him and did not open the door. Bu Xiaoyu had told Daoying several times the reasons for standing up, but still could not move her heart. "I can't not do the revolution because my 'wife' is backward!" Bu Xiaoyu wanted to use various methods to help Daoying progress.

    Bu Xiaoyu told the district chief about the whole story and requested that Daoying also be notified to participate in the next meeting, and the district chief agreed with a smile. Once, the district held a meeting of village activists, and Xiaoyu and Daoying went together. The district chief and district political commissar warmly received Daoying, offered her a seat and tea, and said to her: "It is most glorious for a couple to make a revolution together!" Daoying had never been treated with such respect. After this meeting, she figured it out: in the past, no poor woman was looked up to, but now the world has really changed, so she actively participated in the village activities and led women to engage in wasteland reclamation and production.

    One night, it was raining heavily, and Xiaoyu returned home first. Daoying came home late after opening a women's meeting, and her legs were covered in mud when she pushed the door in. Xiaoyu joked with her: "You used to complain that I came back late from the meeting and didn't open the door for me. Today your legs are covered in mud, and I won't allow you to go to bed." Daoying blushed and said, "Why do you still mention the past!" Xiaoyu joked while helping Daoying get water, and the couple became closer.

　　新区农村新的力量在成长中
    ——记翻身农民卜晓余怎样学会领导群众斗争
    本报记者  力文
    今春，湖南农村展开了规模宏大的社会改革运动，千万以上农民卷入减租、清理积谷（湖南农村大多数村庄，都有由农民筹集的义仓谷，解放前多为地主所控制、贪污或中饱）的斗争；五百七十三万农民参加了农民协会的组织；数十万翻身积极分子，当选为出席各级农民代表会的代表——这一巨大力量的成长，给秋后开始的土地改革运动造成了十分有利的条件。
    益阳五区青石乡（即行政村）农协会主席、出席湖南省第一届农代会的代表——卜晓余，便是万千翻身积极分子中的一个。
  从困苦到解放
    卜晓余小时，帮助父母给地主种田，长大以后当长工，现年二十七岁。卜晓余的父亲以卖柴为生，省吃俭用，节省了三百串铜钱（当时值一百石谷）做押金，才佃上地主邹洪才的三石田。常年产量八十一石，便要纳租五十四石，还另外白给地主做零活。逢年节送鸡送礼。到一九四五年，地主心眼一横，除了把原押金三百串铜钱算成六十块银洋，又要增加四十块银洋的押金。父亲求亲告友地勉强凑上押金。但为时不久，地主又借口他欠租七石，硬要撤佃，磕头请求无效，终于撤佃了。清理押金时，地主张口为凭，硬说是十块银洋一石谷（市价是三元），还扣了两石欠租。百多石进庄谷，只落得八石谷，退庄出屋。卜晓余气得咬牙，但旧社会里地主老爷有钱有势，他只好把恨和气咽在肚子里。
    退佃后，父亲和他小弟兄三个分了家，他分到一斗自耕田。他有老婆、有孩子，怎样生活呢？只好借点高利贷，做做小生意。从那年十月到次年九月，债逼得他没有办法，又托人找到地主贾子才家当长工，包作五石五斗田，除掉田里活，喂猪、捣米、打杂工、做篾工，还得抬轿子。那怕是正忙插秧，一声呼唤，就得赶快去抬，地里活又非按时做好不可。一九四七年四月，他把贾子才的“阳春”（春季生产）做好，贾却另外找到一个价钱更低的小工，把他辞掉了。不当长工没得吃，腊月里又托岳父作保，进了富农贾润江（他的叔伯妻侄）的大门。富人眼里没有他这穷亲戚，到工迟了一天，便扣去他两石谷的工价。去年四月，又是刚忙过“阳春”，贾润江又把他辞掉了。卜晓余没奈何，学做斗笠、扫帚维持生活，老婆带着孩子在外讨吃。
    卜晓余痛恨地主。他听过老人讲：“民国十六年，益阳组织过农协会，斗争地主分田地。后来，农协会被迫解散了，共产党、红军北上了。”他一心一意望着红军回来。
    去年六月，他正在益阳城卖扫帚，听说解放军打下武汉，他跑回家一晚上睡不着。八月三日解放军便解放了益阳城，他兴奋得在家蹲不住，挑起扫帚进城欢迎解放军。坏分子吓唬他：“解放军在城里拉夫子，你去一定吃亏。”晓余心里想：“解放军是打国民党救穷人的，一定不会。”进到城里，看见解放军公平买卖，待人和气，亲热的招呼他，向他问长问短。使他想起来：两年前，有次进城卖炭，在街上放下担子歇口气，伪警察迎头扑面打了他一顿，炭被踢得满街乱滚。他抓住解放军同志的手，激动得说不出话来。
  立场稳、骨头硬
    去年十月，人民政府号召大家开荒生产。坏分子要选做过伪保长的二流子陈伯台当生产组长，卜晓余直急得心头冒火，站起来向大家讲话：“解放军、共产党是为我们百姓办事的，号召我们开荒生产，要选会生产的人。陈伯台游手好闲，怎能领导我们生产？”当时地主坏分子的气焰还未打下去，群众不敢公开讲，只是点点头表示赞成。在坏分子的操纵下，陈伯台被选为正组长，卜晓余被选为副组长。
    后来陈伯台和保长赵伯阳与地主们商议，认为让卜晓余当村干，碍事，不方便，便威胁群众硬把卜晓余罢免了。卜晓余并不灰心，到区里找张区长，反映了村上情况。区长说：“你满心为群众，为啥还选掉你？”晓余说：“趁着老百姓都到山上砍毛柴去了，陈伯台开选举会。全村二千六百多人，到会不满一百六十人，到会贫农还有不投票就回家的。”区干部到青石乡了解情况，召开全村农民大会，讲解政策，重新选举。卜晓余当选为正组长，贫农段莲花当选副组长，陈伯台被选掉了。
    卜晓余领导群众向保长算账，清算出超额公粮一千二百多斤，买了二石五半苦荞种，还有三百斤马铃薯，贷给缺种的农民。
    地主们看出卜晓余立场稳，骨头硬，威胁不行，便想用软法来收买他。地主贾玉生深夜三更到他家，悄悄送给他三个金戒指。他接过来冷笑道：“你不要梦想收买我，记上你一笔退租账吧。你回去告诉别人，按政府法令该多少是多少，减租一定要彻底。”第二天，晓余把地主送金子的事宣布了，农民们高兴的说：“陈伯台、赵伯阳怎能和我们一条心，还是选上自家人，能为大伙办事。”
  学政策、学本领
    今春二月底，卜晓余和其他七个农民代表到区里参加区农代会。这个会主要是讨论组织农协会，进行减租、清理积谷的政策和办法。卜晓余看到有的代表不认真学习，便批评他：“政策学不好，记不住，你回村怎么办工作啊！”他自己则是非常认真地钻研工作中的问题。在一次讨论会上，他曾提出一个问题：政府号召群众生产开荒，可是村中贫农说“开荒是好，我现下没得吃”，公家又没得多少粮食，该怎么办？他这样引起大家讨论这一问题。他已闹清了大种地、小种地的租，该怎样减，退租怎样退，但他继续想：“中农出租的土地，是不是一样退租？回村后怎样向贫农作宣传呢？”弄不清了，就去问区干部。
    因为他肯用脑子，学习成绩好，政策记得清，干起工作来也就有了办法。
  在运动中成长
    八位农民代表，从区里开会回来，经过几天的宣传，发展会员。三月五号农协会正式成立，卜晓余当选为主席。
    开始减租时，虽然曾三番五次宣传政策，但仍有不少佃中农表现不积极。卜晓余和几户佃中农谈心，摸清他们的心思是：“怕退出的租粮，被农协会没收。”卜晓余向他们保证：“退出的租，农会决不没收强分。”一面又进行“一家人”的教育：“贫农佃农一家人，不齐心，租也减不出来。现在正闹春荒，你有吃的了，让贫农兄弟饿着也过意不去啊！多少该让出些退租果实。”他同时又向要平分退租粮的贫农，进行耐心说服：租粮是佃农的血汗，平分是不对的；一家人若是不团结，地主就有空子钻了。
    由于政策执行得好，全村生产情绪高涨，多数人家比去年秧插得早，肥料比去年增加三分之一，还开了三百多亩荒地，增修水田十余亩。中农符安秋一个人开荒三亩，买了十五石石灰（去年十石）做肥，往年很少沤青粪，今年用草皮、树叶沤了一百四十多担粪。中农们还商量着，赠送给农协会一面五星国旗和一面会旗，来表示自己的拥戴。
  一段佳话
    卜晓余参加工作的头两个月，他的老婆贾道英，有些旧脑筋，常常埋怨他不能挣钱，整天在村里瞎忙。甚至晚上卜晓余开会回家晚，她故意为难，不给开门。卜晓余向道英讲过几次翻身道理，仍然打不动她的心。“不能因为‘堂客’（老婆）落后，便不干革命啊！”卜晓余想用各种办法，来帮助道英进步。
    卜晓余到区上把前后情节告诉区长，请求下次开会时也通知道英参加，区长笑着答应了。有一次区里召开村积极分子会，晓余、道英两口子一道去了。区长、区政委热情招待道英，让坐让茶，并向她说：“夫妻俩个闹革命，最光荣啊！”道英从来没受人这样尊敬过，这次会后，她想通了：过去穷家妇女谁看得起，如今真是世道变了，于是就积极参加村里的活动，还领着妇女闹荒闹生产。
    有天晚上，雨下得很大，晓余先回了家。道英开妇女会回家晚些，一推门进来，两腿是泥巴。晓余开她的玩笑：“先前你嫌我开会回来晚，不给我开门。今天你两腿泥巴，我也不准你上床。”道英脸一红说：“过去的事，还提那些干么子？！”晓余一面说笑，一面帮着道英弄水，俩口子更加亲密了。
