　　Promoting National Reunification to Commemorate the Fifth Anniversary of Liberation
    Korean Fatherland Front Issues Appeal
    Suggests Convening a Consultation Conference of Democratic Parties
    Holds Regular General Elections to Achieve Peaceful Reunification
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th] The Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front held its fifth Central Committee meeting on the 5th and an enlarged Central Committee meeting on the 7th. The enlarged Central Committee meeting enthusiastically discussed and unanimously passed a resolution: to issue a letter to the democratic political parties, social organizations, and the people of North and South Korea regarding a plan to further promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.
    The letter first pointed out that the plan for peaceful reunification of the fatherland proposed by the Fatherland United Democratic Front last June has not yet been realized. As we are about to welcome the fifth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation, the artificial 38th parallel still exists, dividing our country into two regions. The Lee Seung-man clique, under the direction of its American masters, is using all kinds of conspiracies to hinder the peaceful reunification desired by the entire Korean people, attempting to sell our country and people as colonial slaves to American imperialism.
    The letter emphasized that the Korean people have deeply experienced the misfortune and disaster caused by the artificial division of the country in the past five years. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Fatherland United Democratic Front once again puts forward a specific plan for peaceful reunification to the democratic political parties, social organizations, and the people of the whole of Korea. The people of North and South Korea should commemorate the upcoming "August 15th" fifth anniversary with the reunification of the fatherland. The main contents of the plan are as follows:
    Hold general elections throughout Korea from August 5th to 8th to establish a unified supreme legislative body. This unified supreme legislative body will meet in Seoul on the fifth anniversary of "August 15th". Before the elections are held, convene a consultation conference from June 15th to 17th, attended by representatives of democratic political parties and social organizations from North and South Korea who support peaceful reunification, to discuss and decide on: (1) the conditions for achieving peaceful reunification; (2) the procedures for electing the Supreme Legislative Body of Korea; (3) the establishment of a central steering committee to guide the general elections. The Central Committee of the Fatherland United Front also proposed that: (1) national traitors and criminals who undermine the peaceful reunification of the country, such as Lee Seung-man, Lee Beom-seok, Kim Seong-soo, Shin Sung-mo, Cho Byeong-ok, Chae Byeong-deok, Baek Seong-uk, Yun Chi-young, and Shin Heung-woo, should not participate in the consultation conference; (2) the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea" should not be allowed to interfere in the reunification of Korea.
    The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Front also decided to send special personnel to South Korea to widely convey the above-mentioned suggestions of the Fatherland United Front to the democratic political parties, social organizations, and democratic figures from all walks of life, except for the pro-American and pro-Japanese reactionaries directly affiliated with Lee Seung-man and Kim Seong-soo.

　　促进国家统一纪念解放五周年
    朝鲜祖国战线发出号召
    建议召开民主党派协商会议
    定期举行总选实现和平统一
    【新华社平壤九日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线于五日举行了中央委员会第五次会议，并于七日举行了中央委员会扩大会议。中央委员会扩大会议热烈讨论并一致通过决定：发表为再度促进实现祖国和平统一方案告南北朝鲜各民主政党、社会团体和全国人民书。
    该书首先指出：祖国统一民主主义战线去年六月间所提出的和平统一祖国的方案，迄今尚未实现。当我们即将迎接“八·一五”解放五周年之际，人工的三八线依然存在，使我国分裂成为两个地区。李承晚匪帮在其美国主子的指使下，正以一切阴谋手段妨害着全朝鲜人民所渴望的和平统一，妄图把我们祖国与人民出卖为美帝国主义的殖民地奴隶。
    该书着重指出：朝鲜人民在过去五年中曾深深地体验到由于国土的人工分裂而带来的不幸和灾害。因此，祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会特向全朝鲜的民主政党、社会团体和全国人民再度提出和平统一的具体方案，南北朝鲜的人民，应以祖国的统一来纪念即将到来的“八·一五”解放五周年。该方案的主要内容如下：
    八月五日至八日，在全朝鲜举行总选举，成立统一的最高立法机关。这一统一的最高立法机关，于“八·一五”五周年纪念日在汉城开会。在举行选举之前，于六月十五日至十七日召开一个由赞成和平统一的南北朝鲜的各民主政党与社会团体代表参加的协商会议，讨论并决定：（一）实现和平统一的各项条件；（二）选举朝鲜最高立法机关的程序问题；（三）成立指导总选举的中央指导委员会。祖国统一战线中央委员会并提议：（一）李承晚、李范奭、金性洙、申性模、赵炳玉、蔡秉德、白性郁、尹致映、申兴雨等民族叛徒及破坏国家和平统一的罪犯，不得参加协商会议；（二）不容许所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”干涉朝鲜的统一事业。
    朝鲜祖国统一战线中央委员会并决定派遣专人赴南朝鲜，向李承晚、金性洙嫡系的亲美亲日反动派以外的各民主政党、社会团体及各界民主人士，广泛传达祖国统一战线的上述建议。
