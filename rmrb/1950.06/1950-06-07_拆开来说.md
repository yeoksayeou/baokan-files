　　Breaking It Down
　　Ye Shengtao
　　Let's start with a few examples this time.

　　(1) To coordinate with the All-China Democratic Women's Federation's notice, published in the People's Daily on March 13, urging all female cadres to study the Xinhua News Agency's March 8 editorial "Learn Skills and Do a Good Job," this issue of the magazine specially selected several articles from newspapers and individuals concerning current women's work and ideological issues. -- April 9, sixth page, "Introducing 'New Chinese Women' Issue 9"

　　(2) In order to enable this movement to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of various organizational institutions and staff at all levels, improve work efficiency, and conserve and cherish state property, so as to adapt to and promote the large-scale economic construction of Northeast China, the First Northeast People's Congress, the Northeast People's Government, and the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China successively made resolutions on implementing streamlining in various organs and departments in Northeast China. -- April 8, first page, "Reducing State Expenditures, Improving Work Efficiency, Northeast China Further Implements Streamlining" (The original sentence wasn't finished here; after "resolution" there's a semicolon, and then over one hundred and ten more characters before the period. It's really too complex. For the sake of discussion, let's break the sentence here.)

　　(3) According to reports from Shanghai's Liberation Daily and News Daily: Shanghai's private cotton textile, silk weaving, dyeing, and canvas and other light industries, due to state-owned cotton yarn, silk, trade trust and other companies, adhering to the principle of considering both public and private interests, actively supporting them through methods such as commissioned spinning, weaving, dyeing, and ordering, and under the circumstances of open consultation between labor and management in various factories to overcome difficulties, production has gradually recovered and is trending towards improvement. -- May 30, first page, "State-Owned Enterprises Vigorously Support, Labor and Management Consult Openly, Shanghai's Cotton Textile and Other Industries Trend Towards Improvement"

　　You can have as many as you want, but these three examples are enough. These three examples are generally not wrong in thought or expression, but such complex sentences make readers feel strained to read them. They have to concentrate fully or reread them to understand them clearly. If you read them aloud or broadcast them on the radio, listeners don't have time to analyze them carefully, so they may not be able to understand them completely. When we write, the first thing is, of course, to think correctly and speak correctly. Second, we must consider the reader and make it as easy as possible for them to understand, writing in a way that allows them to understand immediately. I'm bringing up these three complex sentences for this second reason.

　　These three complex sentences are similar; they all describe a situation and explain its purpose or cause at the same time. In example (1), "this issue of the magazine" "selected" some "articles"; in example (2), "the First Northeast People's Congress," etc., "made" "resolutions"; in example (3), the "production" of "Shanghai's private...light industries" "has" "recovered and" "improved": these are the situations. "To coordinate...notice," totaling fifty-five characters, is the purpose of the situation in example (1); "In order to enable this movement...purpose," totaling sixty-three characters, is the purpose of the situation in example (2); "Due to state-owned...circumstances," totaling sixty-five characters, is the cause of the situation in example (3).

　　Among the three statements explaining the purpose or cause, example (1) is the simplest. Only because the descriptive phrase preceding "notice," "All-China Democratic Women's...'Learn Skills and Do a Good Job'," has as many as forty-nine characters, does it feel strenuous to look at and troublesome to listen to.

　　Example (2) is quite complex. The overall purpose is "In order to enable this movement to achieve...purpose." What purpose is to be achieved? Looking at it literally, "give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of various organizational institutions and staff at all levels," this combines "various organizational institutions" and "staff at all levels," which should be counted as two purposes. "Improve work efficiency" is the third purpose. "Conserve and cherish state property" is another two purposes, because "conserve" and "cherish" are two different things (at least a dot should be added in the middle when writing it on paper). Finally, "adapt to and promote the large-scale economic construction of Northeast China," "adapt to..." is the sixth purpose, and "promote..." is the seventh purpose. But thinking about it in terms of meaning, the above analysis is too mechanical; we can't just see a verb and consider it a purpose. In reality, there are probably only two purposes: "adapt to..." and "promote...": "give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of various organizational institutions and staff at all levels" is a way to "improve" their "work efficiency" and also to get them to "conserve and cherish state property"; "improve work efficiency" and "conserve and cherish state property" are ways to "adapt to..." and "promote..." But we can only guess like this, and can't be sure it was the author's original intention, because the text doesn't express this chain of relationships clearly.

　　Example (3)'s statement of cause is divided into two parts, that is, two causes, connected by a "and." The first part is "due to state-owned cotton yarn...support," and the second part is "under the circumstances of various factories...situation." The first part contains two statements, explaining how to "support," which are "adhering to the principle of considering both public and private interests" and "actively using commissioned spinning...and other methods." With such a complex organization, we have to read directly to "gradually recovered and is trending towards improvement" to know how "Shanghai's private...light industries" are doing now, which is a bit far apart. Also, whether we read it ourselves or listen to someone else read it, we can't help but feel awkward at the place of "and in various factories," as if the topic has been diverted. We have to think carefully again to realize that this is talking about the second cause parallel to "due to state-owned cotton yarn...support."

　　Someone might ask: It's good to consider the reader when writing; but like examples (2) and (3), there are so many purposes and causes, do you have to sacrifice all or part of them to take care of the reader?

　　I plan to answer like this: What must be said must be said, and nothing can be sacrificed. But to make it easier for readers and let them understand immediately, we should try to say fewer complex sentences. When you feel that a sentence is too complicated, you might as well break it into several sentences.

　　Now let's try breaking down examples (1) and (3), and see if reading them is less strenuous. The author's original intention in example (2) can't be determined, so let's not change it.

　　(1) The All-China Democratic Women's Federation published a notice to all female cadres in the People's Daily on March 13, asking them to study the Xinhua News Agency's March 8 editorial "Learn Skills and Do a Good Job." This issue of the magazine, in coordination with this notice, specially selected articles written by several newspapers and several female workers on women's work and ideological issues.

　　(3) According to news from Shanghai's Liberation Daily and News Daily: The production of Shanghai's private cotton textile, silk weaving, dyeing, and canvas and other light industries has gradually recovered and is trending towards improvement. There are two reasons for this. First, because state-owned cotton yarn, silk, trade trust and other companies, based on the principle of considering both public and private interests, actively support those factories by means of commissioned spinning, weaving, dyeing, and ordering. Second, because labor and management in those factories can consult openly and overcome difficulties.

　　The word count of the two examples after being broken down is more than the original. However, if it can make it easier for readers and let them understand immediately, it is worth writing more. In addition to breaking them down, there are also some changes in the wording, not entirely according to the original text; this is also for the sake of making it clearer.

　　Complex sentences that state time usually use methods such as "at the time of..." "after..." ; those that limit the scope usually use methods such as "regarding..." "except..." ; those that clarify the conditions usually use methods such as "under..." "in terms of..." When using these methods, they are often made very complicated, with thirty or forty characters separating the "at" and "time" characters, and forty or fifty characters separating the "except" and "outside" characters. This makes readers feel strenuous. If the reader accidentally skips over the "time" or "outside" character, the meaning of the whole sentence will not be accurate. It is especially dangerous when listening with your ears; "time" and "outside" are both monosyllabic words, which are easy to skip over.

　　I am writing this small article to suggest to my friends: If the parts of a complex sentence concerning purpose, cause, time, scope, conditions, etc., are too complicated, it is best to break them down and turn the complex sentence into several simple sentences. This is to make it easier for readers, and it can also make our meaning directly conveyed to the reader.
　　[Additional words]:

　　Last time my article "A Statement Similar to 'Drink Rice'" was published, I met Mr. Zhang Shouchang that afternoon, and he told me that in a small area of ​​Hebei Province, they do say "drink" for "rice." However, he also said that what that area calls "rice" is actually "porridge" and "paste."

　　The next day, I received a letter from Mr. Bi Shutang, and I am now copying part of it here. "'Drinking rice' is not reasonable, but this dialect does exist. For example, in my hometown (the area of ​​Wendeng County, Shandong Province), this kind of saying is popular. Drink is read as Ha, for example, saying 'Drink morning rice' (Ha Chieh Fan) means eating breakfast, 'Drink midday' (Ha Shang) means eating lunch, 'Drink night rice' (Ha Yeh Fan) means eating dinner. Even when neighbors meet, saying 'Have you drunk?' is equal to 'Have you eaten?' I have also thought about why there is this special saying? I haven't gotten a definite explanation until now. Probably because farmers' families don't have much dishes to eat with rice, they eat a lot, often having 'dry' things like corn cakes, and 'thin' things like cornmeal porridge. Dry things must be eaten with thin things, which are easy to swallow, and the poor often have more thin things and less dry things, or even all thin things. So what is called eating rice is actually only drinking, so they simply say 'drink rice.' This is a guess based on facts. I don't know whether there is an accurate source in dialect. ... As for 'eating rice,' it is also often said, more like the words of city people."

　　A few days ago, Mr. Hu Qiaomu also told me that Mr. Shao Quanlin mentioned that in some areas of Henan Province, they also say "drink" for "rice."

　　Because of my limited knowledge, I said in that small article "But there is absolutely no saying of 'drink rice'," and now I am specially declaring it here to replace the correction.

　　拆开来说
    叶圣陶
    这一回先举几个例子。
    （一）为了配合中华全国民主妇女联合会在三月十三日人民日报发布给全体女干部学习三月八日新华社社论“学会本领做好工作”的通告，该刊本期特意选辑了几个报纸与个人有关目前妇女工作及思想问题的文章。——四月九日第六版“介绍‘新中国妇女’第九期”
    （二）为使这一运动达到发挥各种组织机构及各级工作人员的积极性创造性，提高工作效率和节省爱护国家资财，适应和推进东北大规模的经济建设的目的，东北首届人民代表会议、东北人民政府、中共中央东北局曾先后作出关于在东北各机关部门实行整编的决议。——四月八日第一版“减少国家开支，提高工作效率，东北区进一步贯彻整编”（原文到这里全句还没有完，“决议”之下用个分号，以下还有一百一十几字才是个句号。实在太繁复了。为了便于讨论，姑且在这里断句。）
    （三）据上海解放日报、新闻日报讯：上海市私营棉纺、丝织、染织、帆布等轻工业，由于国营花纱布、蚕丝、贸易信托等公司，本公私兼顾原则，积极以代纺、代织、代染及订货等方式，大力加以扶植，和在各该厂劳资双方开诚协商、克服困难的情况下，生产已得以逐步恢复和趋向好转。——五月三十日第一版“国营企业大力扶植，劳资双方开诚协商，上海棉纺等业趋向好转”
    要多尽可以多，就这三个例子也够了。这三个例子大体上没有想错说错，可是这么样的复句叫读者读下去感觉费力，必须一点儿不放松，或者回上去重读一遍，才可以明确的了解。如果念给人家听，或者在电台上广播，听的人没有从容剖析的时间，就未必能够不折不扣的了解。咱们写东西，第一固然要想得正确，说得正确。第二，还得为读者着想，尽量给读者方便，写得能让读者一下就了解。我要提出这三句复句来说，就为的这第二层。
    这三句复句是同类的，都是叙述一种情况，连带说明它的目的或者原因。在（一）例，“该刊本期”“选辑了”一些“文章”；在（二）例，“东北首届人民代表会议”等“作出”了“决议”；在（三）例，“上海市私营……轻工业”的“生产已”“恢复和”“好转”：这些个是情况。“为了配合……的通告”共五十五个字是（一）例情况的目的；“为使这一运动……的目的”共六十三个字是（二）例情况的目的；“由于国营……的情况下”共六十五个字是（三）例情况的原因。
    三个说明目的或者原因的语句里头，（一）例的最简单。只因为加在“通告”前头的形容语“中华全国民主妇女……‘学会本领做好工作’的”有四十九个字之多，才觉得看起来费力，听起来麻烦。
    （二）例的可就复杂了。总的目的是“为使这一运动达到……目的”。要达到什么目的呢？咱们就字面上看，“发挥各种组织机构及各级工作人员的积极性创造性”，这是把“各种组织机构”跟“各级工作人员”合并起来说的，该算两个目的。“提高工作效率”是第三个目的。“节省爱护国家资财”又是两个目的，因为“节省”跟“爱护”是两回事儿（写在纸面上，中间至少得加个尖点儿）。末了儿“适应和推进东北大规模的经济建设”，“适应……”是第六个目的，“推进……”是第七个目的。但是就意义上想，以上的分析太机械了，咱们不能够见一个动词就认为一个目的。实际上恐怕只有“适应……”跟“推进……”两个目的：“发挥各种组织机构及各级工作人员的积极性创造性”是“提高”他们的“工作效率”的途径，也是叫他们做到“节省爱护国家资财”的途径；“提高工作效率”跟“节省爱护国家资财”又是“适应……”跟“推进……”的途径。但是咱们只能这么样猜测，可不能断定准是作者的原意，因为文字并没有把这一串的关系表达清楚。
    （三）例说明原因的语句分两部分，也就是两个原因，用一个“和”连起来。前一部分是“由于国营花纱布……加以扶植”，后一部分是“在各该厂……的情况下”。前一部分里头又包含两个语句，说明怎么样“加以扶植”，就是“本公私兼顾原则”跟“积极以代纺……等方式”。像这么样复杂的组织，咱们必须直读到“逐步恢复和趋向好转”，才知道“上海市私营……轻工业”现在怎么样了，未免隔得远一点。还有，无论咱们自己读或者听人家念，到“和在各该厂”的地方总不免感觉别扭，仿佛话岔开去了。必须再一细想，才知道这是说的跟“由于国营花纱布………加以扶植”并列的第二个原因。
    有人要问：写东西要为读者着想是不错的；像（二）（三）两个例子，目的跟原因就有那么些，难道为了照顾读者，就得牺牲全部或者一部分吗？
    我预备这么样回答：必须说的非说不可，一点儿也不能牺牲。不过要让读者少费些心思，一下就了解，应该设法少说太繁复的句子。觉得某一句句子头绪纷繁的时候，不妨把它拆成几句来说。
    现在试把（一）（三）两个例子拆开来说，请比较读下去是不是可以少费些心思。（二）例作者的原意究竟怎么样不能断定，只好不改算了。
    （一）中华全国民主妇女联合会在三月十三日的人民日报上给全体女干部发布了一个通告，要她们学习三月八日新华社的社论“学会本领，做好工作”。该刊本期配合着这个通告，特地选辑了几家报社写的和几位妇女工作者写的有关妇女工作和思想问题的文章。
    （三）据上海解放日报、新闻日报消息：上海市私营棉纺、丝织、染织、帆布等轻工业的生产已逐步恢复，趋向好转。这有两个原因。第一，因为国营花纱布、蚕丝、贸易信托等公司，本着公私兼顾的原则，用代纺、代织、代染及订货等方式，积极的扶植那些厂家。第二，因为那些厂家劳资双方能够开诚协商，克服困难。两个例子拆开来说，字数都比原来多。可是，如果能让读者少费些心思，一下就了解，多写一些也是值得的。除了拆开来说以外，文字也有些改动，并不全照原文；这也为的说得更清楚些。
    复句里头叙明时间的，通常用“在……时”“在……之后”等方式；限定范围的，通常用“对于……”“除……外”等方式；点清条件的，通常用“在……下”“就……说”等方式。使用这些方式的时候也往往搞得很繁复，“在”字之后隔开三四十个字才来个“时”字，“除”字之后隔开四五十个字才来个“外”字。这都使读者感觉费力。如果读者不小心把“时”字“外”字滑过，全句的意思就认不准了。凭耳朵听的时候尤其危险，“时”跟“外”都是单音词，很容易滑过的。
    我写这篇小东西，想向朋友们提议：复句里头关于目的、原因、时间、范围、条件等等的部分如果太繁复了，最好拆开来说，把复句化作几个单句。这是给读者方便，也可以使咱们的意思直捷的传达给读者。【附带的话】：
    上一回我的那篇“类乎‘喝饭’的说法”登出来了，当天下午遇见张守常先生，他告诉我河北省有一个小区域，对于“饭”的确说“喝”。不过，他又说，那个区域所谓“饭”实际是“粥”跟“糊”。
    第二天又承毕树棠先生给我来信，现在抄一部分在这儿。“‘喝饭’的说法虽不合理，可是确有这个方言，如吾乡（山东文登县一带）民间即流行此种说法。喝读如Ha，例如说‘喝朝饭’（Ha Chieh Fan ）就是吃早饭，‘喝晌’（Ha Shang）就是吃午饭，‘喝夜饭’（Ha Yeh Fan）就是吃晚饭。甚至邻舍相遇，说声‘喝了吗？’就等于‘吃饭了吗？’我也曾想过，为什么有这种特别的说法？直到现在也没得到确切的解释。大概农民之家吃饭没有什么菜，吃得可不少，往往有‘干的’如玉米饼子之类，有‘稀的’如糁面粥之类，干的总得配着稀的吃，易于下咽，而贫苦者时常是稀的多干的少，甚至全是稀的。那么所谓吃饭事实上只有喝的分儿，所以就干脆说‘喝饭’了。这是按着事实的一种推测，究竟是否有方言上的准确来源，可不得而知。……至如‘吃饭’，也是常说的，比较是城里人的话。”
    前几天胡乔木先生又告诉我，邵荃麟先生说起，河南省某几个区域里对于“饭”也说“喝”。
    因为见闻不广，我在那篇小东西里说了“可是决没有说‘喝饭’的”的话，现在特地在这里声明一下，以代更正。
