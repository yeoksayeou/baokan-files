　　Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Officially Commences Construction
    Entire Project Contracted to PLA of Southwest Military Region
    Expected to Open to Traffic by the End of Next Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway (from Chengdu to Chongqing) officially commenced construction on the 16th. The construction project of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is being carried out according to the contract signed between the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and the Department of Transportation of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee. The contract stipulates that the former is responsible for technical guidance, and the latter is responsible for organizational work and material supply. The Department of Transportation has now contracted the entire project to the People's Liberation Army of the Southwest Military Region and has formed the Chongqing Railway Engineering Bureau to be responsible for guidance.
    The raw materials (steel billets) for the steel rails needed for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway are mostly transported from the Northeast and North China, with a portion smelted in Chongqing, and then rolled into steel rails in Chongqing. The huge bridge equipment for the Tuojiang River and other rivers is supplied by East China. Other equipment is manufactured locally. The private steel smelting and machinery industries in Chongqing, which have been stagnant for several years, have now become active due to the start of construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The Southwest Trade Department is placing large orders with private Zhongxing Steel Plant, Yuxin Steel Plant, and more than thirty other machinery and ironware factories. The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has also enabled 20,000 unemployed workers in Chongqing to participate in the work.
    The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway trunk line is 530 kilometers long. The 125-kilometer section from Chongqing to Zhuyangxi (under the jurisdiction of Jiangjin County) will be open to traffic by the end of this year. It is expected that the entire line will be open to traffic by the end of next year. The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has great economic value. The railway runs from southeast to northwest through the center of the Sichuan Basin. The area along the line is extremely rich in products. After the completion of the railway, the rice and grain from the Chengdu Plain, the salt from Zigong and other places, and the sugar cane from Neijiang, Zizhong and other places, as well as coal, tung oil, mountain products, and wood along the line can be exported in large quantities.
    The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is a section of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway (Chengdu to Hankou), which has been in the planning stage for more than forty years. In 1906, the reactionary Qing Dynasty intended to borrow foreign debt to build it but failed. In 1936, the reactionary Kuomintang government, in order to consolidate its rule over Sichuan, organized the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Engineering Bureau and signed a contract with a French imperialist banking group to start construction; Chiang Kai-shek also repeatedly guaranteed "two years to open to traffic"; however, until the liberation of Sichuan, only some easy projects such as surveying, purchasing roadbeds, and building earthwork, bridges, culverts, and tunnels were done, and the track laying work had not started at all.

### 成渝铁路正式开工  全部工程由西南军区解放军包修  预计明年年底即可全线通车

　　成渝铁路正式开工
    全部工程由西南军区解放军包修
    预计明年年底即可全线通车
    【新华社重庆二十日电】成渝铁路（自成都至重庆）已于十六日正式开工。成渝铁路的修筑工程是根据中央人民政府铁道部与西南军政委员会交通部所订合同进行的。合同规定前者负责技术指导，后者负责组织工作和材料供应等工作。现交通部已将全部工程包与西南军区人民解放军修筑，并组成重庆铁路工程局负责指导。
    成渝路所需钢轨的原料（钢坯）除一部在重庆冶炼外，大部分由东北、华北运来，并在重庆压成钢轨。巨大的沱江等铁桥器材由华东供应。其他器材则在当地制作。数年来陷于停顿状态的重庆市各私营炼钢和机械工业，现在由于成渝路兴工已开始活跃。西南贸易部正向私营中兴公司炼钢厂、渝鑫钢铁厂及其他三十余家机械铁器工厂大批订货。成渝铁路的修建，并使重庆两万失业工人得以参加工作。
    成渝路干线共长五百三十公里。由重庆至朱杨溪（江津县属）段一百二十五公里将于今年年底通车。预计明年年底全线即可通车。成渝铁路的修建具有极大经济价值。该路由东南向西北横穿四川盆地中心。沿线物产极为富饶。该路完成后，成都平原的米粮，自贡市等地的食盐和内江、资中等地的蔗糖以及沿线的煤炭、桐油、山货、木料等均可大宗输出。
    按成渝铁路是酝酿了四十余年的川汉铁路（成都至汉口）之一段。一九○六年满清反动朝廷曾拟借外债兴修未果。一九三六年国民党反动政府为巩固其对四川的统治，又组织成渝铁路工程局，并与法国帝国主义银团订立合同，开工兴修；蒋匪介石并屡次保证“两年通车”；但直到四川解放前，只做了一些测量、购买路基、修筑土石方、桥涵、隧道等项轻易的工程，铺路工程完全没有开始。
