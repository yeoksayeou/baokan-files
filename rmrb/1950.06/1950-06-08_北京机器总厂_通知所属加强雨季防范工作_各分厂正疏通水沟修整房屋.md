　　Beijing Machine Factory
    Notifies Subordinates to Strengthen Flood Season Prevention; Various Branches are Dredging Ditches and Repairing Houses
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The Beijing Machine Factory recently formulated a "Flood Season Prevention Work Plan," notifying all subordinate factories and warehouses to implement it conscientiously. The factories are now following the plan to sweep rooftops, dredge ditches, and repair houses to protect national materials from damage during the rainy season. The plan stipulates that the General Factory and its branches will each organize "Flood Season Prevention Work Groups." Among the workshops, the industrial affairs section (or unit) will, in conjunction with the foremen, designate one or two people to be responsible for rain prevention work, under the direct leadership of the "Prevention Work Group." Routine and pre-rain prevention work includes: Materials that cannot be stored in the warehouse should be protected by building sheds (with tile, ash, or oil felt roofs) to prevent damage from exposure; inspecting all factory circuits and wires, as well as all buildings, for damage; inspecting indoor equipment, paying attention to rain, moisture, and pest prevention for stored goods; inspecting and dredging internal and external waterways throughout the factory, and preparing water absorption tools; storing moisture-sensitive materials and items on shelves as much as possible, and applying grease or talcum powder, etc.; explosive items should be stored in separate rooms; before rain, prevention personnel should review the ditches and properly repair door and window gaps and cracks; in the event of rain leaking into the building, moisture-sensitive items must be covered immediately with mats, tarpaulins, etc., moved to a safe place if necessary, and the team leader notified immediately to hire workers for repairs; iron covers, iron hoods, and tarpaulins should always be available for important machine models and electrical equipment.
    The plan stipulates that after rain, the heads of each prevention team must personally inspect each area in detail, comprehensively verify the various situations, and report them to the factory director. Once repair projects or equipment addition items have been decided and the budget has been approved, construction must begin immediately; however, for special and urgent projects, each team may, depending on the situation, proceed with construction after verbal approval and then complete the budget procedures. Repair and equipment addition work will be designed jointly by the team leaders and designated personnel from each department.
