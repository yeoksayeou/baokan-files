    Planned Promotion of Material Exchange
    Pingyuan Province Arranges Purchase of New Wheat
    Welcomes Private Merchants to Purchase at Reasonable Prices
    [Reported from Xinxiang by our newspaper] In order to protect the interests of farmers and promote material exchange, the economic departments of Pingyuan Province have planned to purchase some new wheat and organize industrial and handicraft products to be sent to the countryside. Wheat in the Pingyuan area will be mostly harvested in early June (around the Grain in Ear solar term). According to custom, after the harvest, farmers will sell some of the wheat on the market to exchange for agricultural tools and daily necessities such as oil and salt, which often results in losses to farmers due to low wheat prices. To this end, the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee discussed and decided on the working steps for stabilizing wheat prices this year on May 29th, emphasizing that the purpose of purchasing wheat is to stabilize wheat prices and protect the interests of farmers. At the same time, it was decided that purchases should begin in key large markets when new wheat is on the market. The quantity of purchases should be determined according to market conditions. Various specialized companies and supply and marketing cooperatives should also plan to organize industrial products such as agricultural tools, gauze, general merchandise, oil, salt, matches, and coal, as well as utensils such as vats, basins, and reed mats, to regulate market needs, so as to withdraw some of the currency released due to purchases and achieve the purpose of stabilizing prices. Purchases should be carried out through market transactions, and private merchants should be allowed to purchase at reasonable prices as much as possible in order to coordinate public-private relations.

    有计划地推动物资交流
    平原省布置收购新麦
    欢迎私商以合理价格进行采购
    【本报新乡讯】平原省经济部门为保障农民利益，推动物资交流，已计划收购部分新麦，并组织工业品及手工业品下乡。平原地区麦产于六月上旬（芒种前后）即可大部收获。照习惯，农民在收获后，将以部分麦子到市场出卖，换取农具及油盐等必需品，往往因麦价低廉，而使农民受到损失。为此，该省财经委员会于五月二十九日，着重讨论并决定了本年平稳麦价的工作步骤。首先明确购麦是为了稳定麦价，保护农民利益。同时决定新麦上市时，即开始在大市集重点收购。收购数量应依市场情况来决定。各专业公司及供销合作社，并应有计划地组织农具、纱布、百货、油、盐、火柴、煤炭等工业品，以及缸、盆、苇席等用具，调剂市场需要，以便回笼部分因收购而放出的货币，达到平稳物价的目的。收购时通过市场交易进行，并应尽量让私商以合理价格进行购买，以求公私关系的调协。
