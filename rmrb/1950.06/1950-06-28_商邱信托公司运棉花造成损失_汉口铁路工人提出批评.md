　　Shangqiu Trust Company Loses Cotton in Transit
    Hankou Railway Workers Criticize

    On the 16th of this month, at 12:07, train number 7629, a covered freight train of thirty-nine cars, arrived at the Xunlimen Station in Hankou from Shangqiu Station in Henan province. All the cars were loaded with cotton belonging to the Shangqiu Trust Company, a total of 2,767 large bales. The bales were machine-packed by manpower and were not very sturdy. The cotton bales had already broken inside the cars, and when the doors were opened to unload the cotton at the station, more than half of the bales were scattered and broken. As a result, cotton was everywhere inside the station. The movers and vehicles trampled and rolled over the cotton. Although the company sent people to sweep up the cotton afterwards, they only swept the cotton on the flat ground. The fine cotton that fell on both sides of the tracks, when collected, was still not a small amount. The flatbed trucks hauling cotton out of the station were neither organized into convoys nor were they assigned escorts, so who knows how much more cotton was lost on the road.

    This kind of loss should be avoided. It is hoped that the comrades responsible for this cotton transport will make a serious self-criticism.

　　商邱信托公司运棉花造成损失
    汉口铁路工人提出批评
    本月十六日十二点零七分，由河南商邱站开到汉口循礼门车站的七六二九次大棚车一列，计三十九辆，都装着商邱信托公司的棉花，共二千七百六十七个大包。包是由人力机打的，不很坚固。花包早就在车内撞破，到站卸花时，车门一开，有一大半花包都破散了。因此站内遍地是棉花。搬运的人和车辆在棉花上踏来滚去。事后该公司虽派人来扫花，但只扫了平地上的花。落在轨道两旁的细花，集拢来也不在少数。板车拉花出站，既未编队，又未派人押车，在马路上又不知道要损失多少棉花。
    这种损失是应该避免的，希望负责这次运花的同志作认真的检讨。
