To Chairman Guo Moruo of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and forwarded to Professor Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council Standing Committee:

    We, the 300,000 people of Taiyuan, responding to the call to defend world peace, have established the Taiyuan Branch of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and are enthusiastically and actively participating in the great movement to defend world peace.

    We, the people of Taiyuan, have been liberated from the reactionary rule of the warlord Yan Xishan for a year now; we are building our own city, we have restored and developed production and cultural and educational undertakings, carried out various municipal constructions, and completed land reform in the suburbs. We need peace, we need construction. We unanimously and resolutely oppose the conspiracy of the imperialist group headed by US imperialism to use the atomic bomb as a weapon of aggression to create a new war.

    We, the 300,000 people of Taiyuan, and the 11 million people of Shanxi Province, must raise our vigilance, unite with the peace-loving people of the world, and unite closely around the world peace fortress headed by the Soviet Union, and resolutely fight to defend lasting world peace and defend people's democracy. We firmly believe that we will always be victorious in the great struggle to defend world peace. Long live lasting world peace!"

    China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Taiyuan Branch
