　　A Certain North China Military Corps Manages the Bohai Alkali Flats
    Reclaiming Nearly a Thousand Hectares of Paddy and Dry Land
    [This newspaper reports] A certain military corps of the North China Military Region has reclaimed 6,400 hectares of paddy and dry land in Bohai Bay. Among them, there are 20 farms with more than 66 hectares each, and ten of them use machinery for irrigation. The largest farm has 500 hectares of rice paddies, and it has seven 60-caliber water pumps. Roads have been built in each farm, and there are large bridges where the roads and canals meet. These roads and bridges are currently only used by large carts, but in the future, tractors will be driving on them.

    Preparations for agricultural production began in December of last year. At that time, many division and regiment leaders braved the snow and led land survey teams to conduct surveys. From both sides of the Daqing River to Shanhaiguan, a distance of 700 li (350 km), almost everything was covered in ice, and the cold wind from the sea swirled with snowflakes. The land survey teams carried luggage and grain (because it was a disaster area) on animals and trekked through the icy and snowy conditions all day long, investigating various issues such as water sources, soil, and crops in various locations.

    In early January of this year, each division and regiment successively determined the areas they would reclaim, and the surveying teams dispatched by the General Production Branch of the military corps conducted surveying work. The weather was still cold, but the ice slowly began to melt, and people often fell into ice holes when walking on the ice. The branches or Party groups of each surveying team and exploration team carried out mobilization work, and cadres personally carried stakes and held range poles, and when necessary, they unhesitatingly broke the ice and jumped into the mud and water. This spirit deeply moved the technical personnel.

    In mid-March, the troops held a production mobilization rally. After the meeting, the soldiers carried guns and shovels, beat drums, and sang songs as they plunged into production. From then on, the desolate small villages from the Daqing River, Jinwei River, and Yuanjia River in the west to the Luan River in the east, within hundreds of li (1 li = 0.5 km), suddenly became lively.

    Work such as digging canals, building embankments, and constructing pumping stations was underway. On the first day, everyone looked at the endless wasteland and the wooden stakes sparsely nailed in the weeds and black mud, and did not know where to start. As a result, many units dug the canals in the wrong places. The cadres asked the engineers to give lectures and humbly inquired about the meaning of the various markings on the wooden stakes. In this way, the cadres understood, explained to the soldiers, and after the soldiers understood, they performed a demonstration construction.

    The teams cultivating land also spread out on the wasteland on both sides of the canals. The warhorses that had been pulling cannons and carrying ammunition for many years also pulled plows. At first, the mules and horses did not recognize the plow and pricked up their ears and kicked. But the soldiers finally tamed them, and they skillfully straightened the plow handles, and black waves of soil turned to both sides.

    In order to ensure that the villagers along the Xiyin River were not affected by the excessive water intake of the farm's water pumps, a team was sent to Xikou to build a large sluice gate. It faced the Haihe River estuary, and there were only eight hours of low tide each day. When the tide came in, the poles used to punt boats could not reach the bottom. The first water retaining dam that was built was washed away by the tide overnight. The technician in charge lost confidence and left. The villagers along the coast could only shake their heads and sigh. But the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were not intimidated by the difficulties. They found the local villagers, inquired about the nature of the Xiyin River, the methods of water control, and the time of the tides, and made various preparations based on this information. As soon as the tide receded, the troops immediately launched an attack from both sides. Some people were knocked down by the waves and climbed up again, and some people tied ropes around their waists on wooden stakes and fought with the waves. They worked under the moonlight at night, and worked in the mud and water for two days and nights, finally completing the most difficult part of the construction project - the first water retaining dam. At this time, the technician who had left returned, and the villagers in the village enthusiastically lent the troops various tools and wrote letters of condolences.

    Currently, two victories have been won in agricultural production - water conservancy projects and seedling cultivation. Three farms have dug more than 20 kilometers of main irrigation and drainage canals. Because these canals are too long, red and white flags are used as signals when releasing water. In the seedling cultivation fields, there are long reed windbreaks, and the first batch of rice seedlings have grown to more than 10 centimeters high.

    Now, the farms are preparing to welcome the third battle - rice transplanting. The rice transplanting team, composed of hundreds of people, is being guided by old farmers and practicing the various movements of uprooting seedlings, bundling seedlings, scattering seedlings, and transplanting seedlings.

### 华北某兵团经营渤海碱滩  垦植水田旱地近千顷

　　华北某兵团经营渤海碱滩
    垦植水田旱地近千顷
    【本报讯】华北军区某兵团已在渤海湾开垦了九万六千亩的水田和旱地。其中一千亩以上的农场共二十个，有十个使用机器进行灌溉。最大的一个农场，七千五百五十五亩稻田，光六十生的口径的扬水机就有七座。各农场里都修起马路，在马路和渠道碰头的地方，有很大的桥梁。这些马路和桥梁，现在还只是通行大车，将来，就要从这上边开进拖拉机。
    农业生产的准备工作，开始在去年十二月。那时不少的师、团首长，冒着雪，率领勘地小组，到外边去勘察。从大清河两岸到山海关，上下七百里，几乎都被冰盖起来了，海上袭来的寒风卷着雪花。勘地小组用牲口驮着行李和粮食（因是灾区），整天在冰天雪地里跋涉，勘查各地的水源、土壤、作物等各项问题。
    今年一月初，各师、团先后确定了自己开垦的地区，兵团生产总分社派下来的测量组，又进行了测量工作。天还是那样冷，冰却慢慢开始化了，人走在冰上，往往会陷到冰窟窿里去。各个测量队、勘察队的支部或党小组，进行了动员工作，干部亲自背桩子抱塔尺，必要时，毫不犹豫地掀开冰凌跳到泥水里。这种精神深深地感动了技术人员。
    三月中旬，部队举行了生产誓师大会。会后，战士们背着枪扛着锨，打着锣鼓唱着歌，投入生产中去了。从此西起大清河、津渭河、袁家河，东到滦河沿岸几百里以内的荒僻的小村庄，突然欢腾起来了。
    挖渠、打埝、修建扬水场等等工作展开了。第一天，大家看着那一眼望不到边的荒滩地，和野草里，黑泥巴里，稀稀拉拉钉着的木桩子，都不知从那里下手，结果，不少单位把渠道挖错了。干部们请工程师给上课，虚心地询问木桩上各种标号的用意。这样，干部闹通了，给战士讲，战士闹通了，再来一次示范施工。
    渠道两旁的荒滩地上，耕地的队伍也展开了。多年来拉炮驮弹药的战马，也拖起耕犁来。开始，骡马不认犁，竖起耳朵撂蹶子。但是战士们，终于把它们驯服了，他们熟练地扶正犁把，黑色土浪便向两旁翻开了。
    为了保证西引河沿岸的老乡用水不受农场扬水机吸水太多的影响，一支队伍被派到西河口去修一座大水闸。那里正对着海河口，每天只有八小时的落潮时间，潮水一上来，撑船的竿子够不到底。第一次修起的挡水坝，一夜的工夫就被潮水冲垮了。担任指导的技师丧失信心地走开了。沿岸的老乡也只能摇头叹息。但是解放军的战士们却没有被困难吓倒，他们找当地老乡，询问西引河的水性，治水的办法和潮水的来去时间等，根据这些做好了各种准备工作。潮水一落，部队马上从两岸同时进行突击。有的人被浪头打下去了又爬上来，有的人用绳子把腰拴在木桩上和浪头搏斗，到夜里还在月光下工作，泥里水里足足干了两天一夜，终于完成了修建工程中最困难的一项——第一道挡水坝。这时，走了的技师又回来了，村子里的老乡们热情地借给部队各种工具，并写信慰问。
    目前，在农业生产上已经打了两个胜仗——水利工程和育苗工作。三个农场已经挖好四十华里以上的引排水干渠。这些渠道因为太长，放水时要用红白旗作讯号。在育苗地里，有很长的苇子防风障，第一批稻芽子已经长出四寸多高的苗儿了。
    现在，各农场正准备迎接第三次战斗——插秧。几百人组成的插秧大队，正由老农指点着，练习着起秧、捆秧、撒秧、插秧的各种动作。
