　　Preventing Mold Damage to Grain During the Rainy Season:
    Beijing Grain Company Actively Inventories Warehouses
    [Report from this newspaper] To prevent mold damage to stored grain during the rainy season, the Beijing Grain Company concentrated its efforts in May to inventory warehouses and turn over the grain for ventilation. A total of 1,335 stacks were turned over throughout the month, with the amount of grain exceeding April's figures by nearly 50%. By the end of May, the moisture content of all stored grain had significantly decreased. The amount of grain with a moisture content above 14% had been reduced from 96 million jin at the end of April to 27 million jin. All drying work will be completed before the 15th of this month, striving to reduce the moisture content of all stored grain to around 13%.
    The company had previously studied warehouse storage technology. For example, high empty spaces in ventilated stacks, which are unsuitable for preventing wind, were changed to flat stacks. Lotus leaf mats are good for preventing rain on the top edges of the stacks, but are easily blown off by the wind, so they were replaced with three-strand hemp rope netting over the stacks to prevent the top mats from being blown off. It was also found that ramie threads are brittle and easily rot in the rain and break in the wind. After wind, the stacks are easily loosened or the needle holes in the mats are enlarged, causing leaks. Three-strand hemp rope should be used instead. In terms of rain prevention, based on the experience of the previous spring rain, and in conjunction with turning over the grain, the stack positions were adjusted, using the ground freed up by turning over the grain to level and pad the ground and dig and repair drainage ditches. "Horse racks" were also added to the tops of the stacks to facilitate rain prevention and ventilation. Currently, the weather is gradually getting hotter, and grain is prone to insects. During an inspection of the Yongdingmen warehouse, it was discovered that flour had been gnawed by rats. In response, the company has made specific arrangements and the laboratory is researching pharmaceuticals, which are currently being tested.
    In management, cadres and workers all implement a zone-by-zone and group-by-group responsibility system, which has greatly strengthened the workers' enthusiasm and improved work efficiency. For example, the groups at the Xizhimen warehouse launched a competition, cleaning up a total of 12,000 jin of soil-contaminated grain, reducing the amount of accumulated soil-contaminated grain in the entire warehouse to 7,000 jin. Due to the division of zones and the results of the cleanup, packaging has been categorized into designated areas, and there are no longer scattered packaging materials in the yard.

　　雨季来临预防存粮霉坏
    北京粮食公司积极盘点仓库
    【本报讯】北京市粮食公司预防雨季存粮霉坏，于五月份集中力量盘点仓库，翻倒通风，全月共翻倒囤垛一、三三五个，粮斤数字超过四月将达百分之五十。截至五月末，全部库存粮水分已有显著降低，含水量在百分之十四以上者，已由四月末的九千六百万斤减到二千七百万斤。全部晾晒工作将在本月十五日以前完成，争取存粮水分全部减到百分之十三左右。
    该公司事先曾研究了仓库保管技术工作。如透风垛中空体高，不适防风，即改为一车扁垛。莲花席苫囤牙子大，便于防雨，但遇风易被刮掉，即改用三股线麻作网套在囤上，以免顶席吹落。又发现苎麻大串质脆，遇雨即糟，遇风即断，风后囤垛易被刮松或缝席针眼刮大漏雨，宜用三股麻线绳。在防雨方面，根据上次春雨经验，结合翻倒，调整囤位，利用翻倒腾出地面，进行平垫及挖修水沟，并在囤顶加置“马架”，以利防雨和通风。目前天气渐热，粮食易于生虫。永定门检查仓库时，发现面粉有被鼠咬情事。该公司对此除有具体布置外，并由化验室研究药剂，现正在试验中。
    在管理上，干部工人均实行分区分组负责制，这样大大加强了工人的积极性，提高了工作效率。如西直门仓库各组发起竞赛，清理土粮计达一万二千斤，使全库堆集之土粮数减至七千斤。由于区组划分和清理结果，包装均已归纳到指定区内，场内再不见散乱的包装品了。
