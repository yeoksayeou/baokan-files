　　My Thoughts on Attending the Beijing Literary and Art Congress
    Wang Yaoqing

　　I feel very honored to participate in the first Beijing Municipal Congress of Literary and Art Workers. I would like to share some of my thoughts on attending this congress. The convening of this congress demonstrates the importance the People's Government attaches to literary and artistic work. Therefore, those of us engaged in literary and artistic work should create even more achievements. Speaking of our Peking Opera circles, progress has been slower compared to drama and folk art circles. Why is this? Most of us Peking Opera practitioners lost the opportunity for schooling in our youth. From a young age, we entered opera schools to learn acting, and after graduation, we joined troupes to perform. Generally, people are very conservative, believing that art is transcendent and has nothing to do with politics. We neither study the ideological content of the works, nor do we care whether they have educational significance. Now we already know that literary and artistic work is to serve the broad masses of working people. Recently, the relevant authorities have organized two training courses. The students who graduated have gained a lot of new knowledge. Among them, there are quite a few activists. Now the students in the Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts and the Chinese National Academy of Peking Opera are making great progress in their studies. The plays they perform are also relatively good and can serve as an example for all of us Peking Opera practitioners. The Ministry of Culture's Bureau of Opera Reform and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education's Literature and Art Department have compiled many new scripts and reformed many old scripts. Everyone can muster courage and sing them more often. Every Peking Opera worker must take a firm stand, study politics more, and recognize the role that drama plays in the masses. Our entire literary and artistic community must unite closely, exchange opinions with each other, and form a solid and powerful united front of literary and art workers.

　　Finally, I hope that all comrades in the literary and art circles will guide us and help us at any time. I also hope that all my colleagues in the Peking Opera circles will consciously work hard and strive to be models of opera reform!

　　我参加北京文代会的感想
    王瑶卿
    我这次参加北京市首届文学艺术工作者代表大会，感到非常荣幸。现在略微谈一点我参加这个大会的感想。这个大会的召开正是表明人民政府对于文艺工作的重视。因此，我们作文艺工作的人，更要创作出成绩来。谈到我们京剧界，比起话剧界、曲艺界的进步要慢。这是什么缘故呢？我们京剧工作者差不多都是幼而失学。从小的时候，就入科班学戏，毕业后搭班演戏。一般人都富于保守性，以为艺术是超然的，和政治是无关的。我们既不研究作品的思想内容，也不去管它有没有教育意义。现在我们已经知道文艺工作是为广大劳动人民服务的。最近有关当局主办两期讲习班。毕业出来的同学得了许多新知识。内中很不乏积极分子。现在戏曲实验学校、京剧研究院两单位的同学学习都很进步，所演出各戏也比较好，可以作为我们京剧工作者诸位的榜样。中央文化部戏曲改进局与北京市文教局文艺处两方面已编出许多新剧本，也改革了许多旧剧本。大家可以拿出勇气来，多多演唱。我们每个京剧工作者必须站稳立场，多多学习政治，认识戏剧在群众中所显示的作用。我们整个文学艺术界要密切团结起来，彼此交换意见，结成巩固强大的文艺工作者的统一战线。
    最后我希望文艺界诸同志随时指导我们，帮助我们，更盼望我们京剧界诸同仁自觉努力，争取做戏曲改革的模范！
