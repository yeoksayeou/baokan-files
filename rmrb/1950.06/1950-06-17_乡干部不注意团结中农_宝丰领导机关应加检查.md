　　Township Cadres Neglect Unity with Middle Peasants: Baofeng Leading Organs Should Increase Inspection
Editor Comrade:
    In Baofeng County, Henan Province, many township cadres have a vague understanding of the policy of uniting with middle peasants. They believe that "not infringing upon the middle peasants in the land reform is already a bargain for them." After the land reform was completed, these township cadres always felt that "middle peasants have more land, more houses, and more farm tools," and that "their lives are still better than those of poor peasants." Therefore, after the completion of the land reform, many districts and villages have continuously seen phenomena infringing upon the interests of middle peasants. In the production mutual aid in Yiyang District, middle peasants were forcibly incorporated into groups, saying that middle peasants have livestock and can help those who don't have livestock to cultivate, causing panic to middle peasant Fan Siyuan, who ended up selling an ox. After a certain village in the Sixth District forcibly incorporated middle peasants into groups, thirty middle peasant households were brewing to sell livestock. In March, when Xitaiping Village was repairing a bridge, three stonemasons worked for seven or eight days, and their meals were all assigned to middle peasant families; the thousand catties of grain used to repair the bridge were also planned to be donated by middle peasants, but fortunately the secretary of the district committee discovered and stopped it. Bian Yin, a middle peasant in Xitaiping Village, said dissatisfiedly: "The cadres only see the middle peasants, and they want the middle peasants to do more for everything!" This situation also exists in other districts of Baofeng County. This has seriously affected the production enthusiasm of middle peasants, as well as the relationship between poor and middle peasants and the relationship between cadres and the masses. The leadership of the county should pay serious attention to this. I suggest:
    1.  Strengthen education on uniting with middle peasants for district and township cadres, so that they can clearly understand in their minds that not only should the interests of middle peasants not be infringed upon during land reform, but also after land reform, in terms of burden policy, production mutual aid, and democratic rights, the tendency to infringe upon the interests of middle peasants should be overcome.
    2.  The Baofeng County District Peasants' Association should conduct an inspection on the implementation of the middle peasant policy and correct deviations.
    3.  In the leadership of rural political power and the Peasants' Association, a democratic system should be established, and matters should be discussed jointly by poor and middle peasants, and decisions should be made through everyone's discussion.
                                              Hu Shanghe, Zhang Fengchang

### 乡干部不注意团结中农  宝丰领导机关应加检查

　　乡干部不注意团结中农  宝丰领导机关应加检查编辑同志：
    河南宝丰县有不少的乡干部对于团结中农政策在思想上认识模糊。他们认为“在土地改革中不侵犯中农已经是便宜了他们”。在土改已经完成后，那些乡干部们总觉得“中农土地多，房多，农具多”，“生活还比贫农好”。因此，在土改完成之后，不少区村就连续发生着侵犯中农利益的现象。滍阳区在生产互助中强编中农入组，说中农有牲口，好帮助没牲口的耕种，引起中农范四源的恐慌，结果他卖掉一头牛。六区某村强编中农入组后，有三十户中农酝酿卖牲口。三月间西太平村修桥，三个石匠做了七八天工，吃饭均派到中农家；修桥用的一千斤粮，也打算叫中农捐出，幸被区委书记发觉后制止。西太平村中农边印不满的说：“干部光看见中农，闹什么都要中农多干点！”宝丰县其他区也有这种情况。这样，严重地影响了中农的生产积极性，也影响了中贫农关系及干群关系。该县领导上应严重注意。我建议：
    一、对区乡干部应加强团结中农的教育，使他们在思想上明确认识不仅在土地改革时不能侵犯中农利益，且在土改后，在负担政策上，在生产互助上，民主权利上，均要克服侵犯中农利益的偏向。
    二、宝丰县区农协应对中农政策的执行情形作一次检查，纠正偏向。
    三、在乡村政权及农协的领导上，应当建立民主制度，有事应由贫中农共同商量，大家讨论决定。
