Tangshan Special District Primary School Teachers Tenaciously Fight Against Famine
Combining Production and Disaster Relief to Persist in Teaching
Enrollment of Children in the District Increased by 44,000 Compared to Before the Disaster

[Our newspaper, Changli News] The vast number of rural primary school teachers in the Tangshan Special District, Hebei Province, under the leadership of governments at all levels, have combined production and self-rescue to tenaciously fight against the famine and persist in and develop education in the disaster area over the past year. Of the 4,325 primary schools in the district, 4,152 have consistently maintained classes, and the number of enrolled students has increased from 348,877 before the disaster last year to 392,180 this year. Many primary schools in lightly affected areas have further improved their teaching efficiency.

After the flood last year, in order to maintain education in the disaster area, Tangshan Special District convened teacher symposiums in various counties, and 125 model teachers were selected to attend a meeting in the special district. After careful evaluation, five model teachers, including female teacher Lang Jiehua, who achieved success in persisting in teaching in impoverished mountain villages, were selected, rewarded and commended, and teachers throughout the district were called upon to establish the idea of serving the people's education事业 热诚, to learn from the hard-working spirit of model teachers, to closely integrate the principle of combining production and disaster relief, and to persist in education in the disaster area. This meeting prepared the primary school teachers throughout the district ideologically to overcome difficulties, lower their living standards, and persist in education in the disaster area. Over the year, a large number of model teachers emerged in various counties, carrying out arduous and extraordinary struggles against the famine for the people's education事業, demonstrating the noble qualities of people's teachers.

Persisting in Teaching Despite Not Receiving Salaries and Not Having Enough to Eat

Many teachers managed to not receive or receive less salary, and some even carried rice from home to maintain their lives and persist in teaching, displaying the spirit of selflessness and serving the people. For example, Wang Zizhen, a teacher in Daguan Gu Leng in the heavily affected area of ​​Fengrun County, and Zhang Shigeng, a teacher in Xiaoguan Gu Leng, did not want the village to bear a grain of food, and automatically brought rice from home to maintain their lives. They also patiently mobilized students to persist in school and seized their spare time to lead students to pick up firewood to help students' families solve the difficulty of burning firewood, which was welcomed by the masses and consolidated the students' learning mood. Yue Shiying, a junior female teacher at Dalinggou Primary School in the Eighth District, only ate a sauerkraut every day when she ran out of food for a few days after school started, but she still persisted in class, so that more than 40 students did not drop out of school. More than 80% of the teachers in Qianxi County could only be provided with food by the village, but they still actively persisted in teaching. Liu Zhiyuan, a teacher at Xingcheng Township Senior Primary School, donated his salary to help the school construction and subsidized the tuition fees for two sixth-grade students, which increased the number of students in the school from 200 last year to more than 400 this year. Zhu Wenhua, a teacher in Zhao Zhuangzi, Qian'an First District, had to run back to his home three miles away from the school to eat every day because the village could not afford to pay his salary, but he never delayed the students' learning. Qin Haiyuan, a teacher in Shahezhuang, Sixth District, had a very difficult family life. The village could only provide 45 catties of millet per month, and his wife went out to beg for food, but he still persisted in teaching.

Teaching while Leading Students in Production

In particular, the model teachers in heavily affected counties such as Leting, LuanNan, and Yutian not only painstakingly adopted methods such as having classes in the morning and production in the afternoon, or production during the day and make-up classes in the evening, to organize students to learn, but also used their spare time to find ways to organize students to carry out various sideline productions. This solved the students' learning expenses and helped the students' families through the famine. For example, since last winter, teachers throughout Leting County have actively led students to pick up firewood and accumulate fertilizer in their spare time. Zhao Yongshun, a teacher at Anjia Hai Elementary School in the Fifth District, used two Sundays to lead more than 30 students to sweep niter soil and boil niter, and each person received 16 catties of corn. Teachers in Hu Tuo in the First District also led students to make clay figures with water glue, clay, black soil, and paint, and opened a clay figure cooperative. Each person could make up to 100 clay figures in one night, which were sold to Tangshan and Tianjin, and each one could be sold for 100 yuan. Nearly 200 students in the third grade and above at Xinzhai School in the Sixth District went to pick cotton for the cooperative every Sunday, and each person could earn 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per day. Schools such as Dongxigaodian, Jingtuo, and Jixiang Temple in the First District also organized amateur weaving, pocket weaving, and spinning groups. Zhang Yaoran, a teacher at Yangling Complete Primary School in the coastal area of ​​LuanNan County, first went to Aoshang Village to learn how to weave jar lids and pot lids with reeds in order to teach students how to weave. He seized his spare time to teach the students, so that all the students were engaged in weaving in their spare time and labor classes. Each person could weave a jar lid every day without affecting their classes, and could earn two catties of red grain. The students also taught their parents when they returned home, which led the masses in the whole village to engage in weaving sidelines. In addition, the school also organized younger students into a vegetable digging group to dig vegetables during their free time in the afternoon, which was warmly supported by the masses, who sent their children to school one after another, increasing the number of students in the school from 161 to 211, breaking the highest record of children entering school in previous years.

Teachers in Lightly Affected Areas Donate and Borrow Grain to Help Heavily Affected Areas Persist in Education

In addition, some teachers in lightly affected areas also donated and borrowed grain to help teachers in heavily affected areas maintain their lives, supporting the start of school. For example, in the severely affected 13th District of Fengrun County and some heavily affected villages in the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th, and 11th Districts, the masses were unable to afford the teachers' salaries. The county, through the education association in each district, mobilized teachers in lightly affected areas throughout the county to donate grain to maintain the opening of all primary schools in heavily affected areas. Primary school teachers in Zunhua County launched a movement to donate three catties of rice, which maintained the schools in 13 heavily affected villages from collapsing. Teachers in five lightly affected areas of Yutian County launched a "Bowl of Rice" movement, donating 1,850 catties of millet, and wrote letters to comfort, support, and encourage teachers in heavily affected areas to persist in teaching. Many senior primary school teachers used their salaries to maintain the lives of junior primary school teachers.

At present, due to the fact that the summer famine has developed quite seriously in some areas, some teachers' lives have become unsustainable. After learning about this situation, the Education Department of the Hebei Provincial Government urgently allocated 800,000 catties of education relief grain. The Education Section of the Tangshan Special Commissioner's Office also immediately instructed education cadres in various counties and districts to convene village education committee members and primary school teachers to hold meetings for evaluation and discussion, and to provide relief according to actual needs to maintain the opening of schools. After 38,400 catties of grain were urgently allocated to save the 70 schools that had originally collapsed in Yutian County, 56 of them have now been restored. Other heavily affected counties such as Qianxi and Fengnan are also working hard to restore them.

    唐山专区小学教师顽强与灾荒搏斗
    结合生产救灾坚持教学
    全区入学儿童比灾前还增加了四万四千
    【本报昌黎讯】河北省唐山专区广大农村小学教师，一年来在各级政府的领导下，结合生产自救，顽强地与灾荒搏斗，坚持并发展了灾区的教育工作。全区四千三百二十五处小学，有四千一百五十二处一直坚持上课，而且入学学生由去年灾前的三十四万八千八百七十七名增加到今年的三十九万二千一百八十名；许多轻灾区小学，更提高了教学效率。
    去年水灾发生后，唐山专区为了坚持灾区教育，各县普遍召开了教员座谈会，推选出一百二十五名模范教师到专区开会。经过认真评议，选出了在贫困山庄坚持教学有成绩的女教师郎洁华等五名模范教师，给以奖励和表扬，并号召全区教员要树立为人民教育事业热诚服务的思想，学习模范教师的艰苦奋斗精神，密切结合生产教灾原则，坚持灾区教育。此次会议，给全区小学教师克服困难、降低生活水平、坚持灾区教育，作了思想准备。一年中，各县涌现了大批模范教师，为了人民的教育事业，与灾荒进行了坚苦卓绝的斗争，表现了人民教师的高贵品质。
    领不到薪金吃不饱肚子仍坚持教学
    许多教师作到了不支薪或少支薪，还有的从家里背米维持生活、坚持教学，发挥了舍己为人民服务的精神。如丰润县重灾区大官沽堼教员王子珍和小官沽堼教员张士耕，不要村中负担一粒粮，自动由家带米维持生活，还耐心动员学生坚持上学，并抓紧课余领着学生拾柴，供给学生家庭解决烧柴困难，受到了群众的欢迎，巩固了学生的学习情绪。八区大岭沟小学初级女教员岳士英，开学后有几天断炊时，每天只吃一棵酸菜，仍坚持上课，使四十多名学生没有失学。迁西县百分之八十以上教员，村里只能供给吃的，依然积极坚持了教学。兴城镇高级小学教员刘志远，捐出薪金帮助学校建设，还补助了两名六年级学生上学用费，因此使全校学生由去年的二百名激增到今年的四百多名。迁安一区赵庄子教员朱文华，因该村无力供给教薪，每天跑回距学校三里的家里去吃饭，也从来没有耽误学生学习。六区沙河庄教员秦海元，家庭生活很困难，村里每月只能供给小米四十五斤，老婆出去讨饭，他依然坚持着教学。
    一面教学，一面带领学生生产。
    特别是乐亭、滦南、玉田等重灾县份的模范教师们，不仅辛苦的采取了上午上课、下午生产或白天生产、晚上补课等方法，组织学生学习，并利用课余时间，想办法组织学生开展了各种副业生产。解决了学生学习费用，还帮助了学生家庭度荒。如乐亭全县教员，自去年冬季以来，都积极领导学生课余拾柴、积肥；五区安家海初小教员赵永顺，并利用两个星期日，带领三十多名学生扫硝土熬硝，每人分得玉米十六斤；一区胡坨教员并领导学生，用水胶、土子、黑土、颜料做泥人，开了一个泥人合作社，每个人一天晚上最多能做出一百个，往唐山和天津推销，每一个能卖一百元；六区新寨学校三年级以上学生近二百名，每个星期日都去给合作社摘棉花，每人每天能赚一千元至两千元；一区东西高店、井坨、吉祥寺等学校，并组织了业余织布、织口袋和纺线小组。滦南县沿海区杨岭完小教师张耀然，为了教学生编织，自己先到廒上村学会了用苇子织缸帽和编锅盖，抓紧课余时间教给学生，使全校学生在课余自由活动时间和劳作课中都搞编织，每人每天在不误上课的情况下，都能织出一顶缸帽子，能赚红粮二斤。学生回家并教会了家长，带动全村群众也搞起了编织副业。此外，该校又把小同学组成挖菜组，利用下午自由活动时间去挖菜，受到群众的热烈拥护，纷纷把自己的子女送到学校去念书，使全校学生由一百六十一人增加到二百一十一人，打破了往年儿童入学的最高纪录。
    轻灾区教师捐借粮食，帮助重灾区坚持教育。
    此外，一部分轻灾区教师，还捐借粮食，救济重灾区教师维持生活，支持了开学。如丰润县灾荒严重的十三区全区和二、四、五、八、十一等区部分重灾村，群众无力负担教员薪金。该县通过各区教联会，发动全县轻灾区教员献粮捐助，维持了重灾区小学全部开学。遵化县小学教员发起了捐献三斤米运动，维持了十三个重灾村的学校没有垮台。玉田县五个轻灾区的教员们，开展了一碗米运动，捐助了一千八百五十斤小米，并写信慰问、支援与鼓励重灾区教师坚持教学。许多高小教员，都借助薪金来维持初小教员的生活。
    目前，由于夏荒在部分地区发展得颇为严重，有些教员的生活已经无法维持。河北省府教育厅知道这一情况后，已急拨教育救济粮八十万斤；唐山专署教育科也立即指示各县、区教育干部，召集村教育委员和小学教员开会评议，按实际需要进行救济，维持开学。玉田县原垮了的七十处学校，经拨粮三万八千四百斤急救后，现已恢复了五十六处，其他如迁西、丰南等重灾县份，也正在紧张的进行恢复中。
