　　Moving Forward Along the Road to Happiness
    —Notes on the International Children's Picture Exhibition at the Beijing Library
    By Our Correspondent Mu Yang
    Children living in the era of New Democracy are happy, and children living in the era of Socialism are even happier. The photographs in the International Children's Life Picture Exhibition at the Beijing Library powerfully illustrate this truth.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders frantically massacred the Chinese people, and Chinese children suffered unprecedented disasters. Many children died tragically under the enemy's bombs and bayonets, or became orphans who lost their fathers and mothers. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang inherited the mantle of the Japanese invaders. One bloody hand reached into the Liberated Areas to carry out brutal burning and killing; the other reached into the areas it occupied, imposing exorbitant taxes and levies, and forcing many teenagers onto the battlefield.
    In the Liberated Areas, during extremely difficult days, the Communist Party and the People's Government always cared for the children. Whenever a place was liberated, schools were restored with the establishment of the people's power. As a result of rent reduction and interest rate reduction and land reform, a large number of children of poor peasants and farm laborers gained the opportunity to study. Look! The children of the Liberated Areas are, along with their parents, shouldering the responsibility of defending the motherland. On the hillsides, along the roads, and at the entrances of villages, there are children with red-tasseled spears or in disguise, monitoring the enemy's actions and questioning suspicious passers-by. The deeds of many moving little heroes spread throughout the Liberated Areas.
    The blood and tears of the children and their fathers and mothers were not shed in vain. Now, the children of New China are receiving the close care of the state. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 541 public and private childcare facilities in 27 important provinces and cities across the country, caring for 35,000 children, a threefold increase compared to last October. In some cities, factory nurseries account for about 50% of all nurseries in the city. In education: there are already 300,000 primary schools nationwide, accommodating 20 million children. The number of children attending school in many areas has greatly increased compared to before liberation, with the children of the working people accounting for the majority. Many children abandoned on the streets by the old society have also been adopted by the state. The children of New China have embarked on the road to happiness.
    In the Soviet picture exhibition hall, more children of New China and their fathers and mothers saw a happy vision, a bright and splendid future.
    In the Soviet Union, children's education and all children's welfare undertakings have become one of the main tasks of the state. Nurseries and kindergartens have been widely established throughout the Soviet Union. In 1949, more than 800,000 children entered permanent nurseries, 1.5 million entered kindergartens, and seasonal nurseries were able to accommodate 4 million children.
    Soviet children's education has also been unprecedentedly developed, and the doors of schools are open to the children of every worker. Now, 34 million children are being educated in 220,000 primary and secondary schools in a hundred different languages. In 1914, only 7.9 million children were able to receive such education. Books have also become the property of children across the country. Five state-run publishing houses publish books for children year after year. In the past 20 years, they have printed 714 million copies of books for children.
    In the Soviet Union, children also have a share in drama, film, and radio. One hundred and forty children's theaters and puppet theaters regularly perform for children; many film studios have produced countless literary and educational films for children.
    In the Soviet Union, health care for mothers and children is an important task of the state: there were only nine maternal and child health clinics in 1914, but in 1948 there were 7,552. The number of hospital beds in maternity hospitals has also increased from 6,824 in 1914 to 117,630. Every parturient and sick child can receive free treatment in maternal and child health institutions.
    In the past and present, in capitalist countries, bearing and raising children has always been the pain of working women, but in the Soviet Union it has become a noble vocation and is respected by the state. From 1944 to 1948, 28,500 mothers with ten children were awarded the title of "Mother Heroine" and received medals, and 2.5 million mothers who gave birth to five to nine children were awarded the "Maternal Glory" Medal or the "Maternity" Medal.
    With the help of the Soviet Union, North Korea, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, brotherly countries that gained complete liberation earlier than us, children also gained more happiness earlier. In these countries, the welfare work for working women and their children is receiving the close attention of the state. Take Romania as an example, Article 26 of their constitution stipulates: "Maternity and children under the age of eighteen have the right to enjoy special medical treatment." By 1949, the state had established 734 maternity hospitals and 1,948 children's clinics in rural areas alone. To ensure that mothers participate in the country's construction work, 188 full-time nurseries, 435 day-care nurseries, and 2,888 kindergartens have been established. The state's health aircraft also undertakes high-altitude treatment for the children of workers. This has reduced the child mortality rate in Romania after the establishment of the Republic from 18% to 10%. This year, the state plans to send 57,000 children of workers to summer camps in the mountains and by the sea to enjoy the summer vacation.
    This is the road the Soviet Union has already traveled, and it is the road we are about to embark on. Those children who yearn for a happy vision, and the fathers and mothers who love their children, let us learn more from the Soviet Union and move forward along this road to happiness!

　　沿着幸福的道路前进
    —记北京图书馆国际儿童图片展览
    本报记者  穆扬
    生活在新民主主义时代的儿童是幸福的，生活在社会主义时代的儿童是更幸福的。北京图书馆国际儿童生活图片展览会中的照片，有力地说明了这个真理。
    抗日战争期间，日寇疯狂屠杀中国人民，中国儿童遭受了空前的灾难。许多孩子惨死在敌人的炸弹和刺刀下，或是变成失掉爸爸妈妈的孤儿。日寇投降后，蒋介石匪帮继承了日寇的衣钵。它一只血腥的魔掌伸向解放区，进行残暴的烧杀；另一只魔掌则在被它占领的地方，强征暴敛，派夫抓丁，不少十多岁的孩子，也被他们驱上了战场。
    在解放区，在极艰苦的日子里，共产党和人民政府始终关怀着孩子们。每当解放一个地方，学校就随着人民政权的建立而恢复起来。减租减息及土地改革的结果，大批贫雇农的儿女，得到了求学的机会。看吧！解放区的孩子们，正同他们的父母一起，肩负着保卫祖国的责任。在山岗上，大道边，村子口，到处都有手拿红缨枪或伪装着的孩子，监视着敌人的行动，盘查着可疑的过路人。许多可歌可泣的小英雄的事迹传遍了解放区。
    孩子们同他们爸爸、妈妈的血泪没有白流。现在，新中国的儿童受到国家亲切的关怀。据不完全的材料统计，目前在全国二十七个重要省市中，已有公私立托儿机关五四一处，受托儿童已达三万五千名，较去年十月增加了三倍。其中某些城市的工厂托儿所，则已达全市托儿所的百分之五十左右。在教育方面：全国已有三十万所小学校，可容二千万儿童入学。不少地区的就学儿童已较解放前大大增加，劳动人民的子女在其中占了多数。许多被旧社会遗弃在街头的孩子，也受到国家的收养。新中国的儿童已经踏上了幸福的道路。
    在苏联图片的展览室里，更多的新中国的孩子和他们的爸爸和妈妈，看到了幸福的远景，一个光辉灿烂的未来。
    在苏联，儿童教育与儿童的一切福利事业，已成为国家的主要工作之一。托儿所与幼稚园已在苏联全境广泛地建立起来。在一九四九年，进入常设托儿所的儿童已达八十万人以上，进入幼稚园的已达一百五十万，季节性的托儿所则已能容纳四百万儿童了。
    苏联的儿童教育，更得到了空前的发展，学校的大门向每一个劳动者的子女敞开着。现在，三千四百万儿童正在二十二万所中小学校以百种不同的语言受着教育。在一九一四年能够受到这种教育的儿童，则只有七百九十万。书籍也已经成为全国儿童的所有物。五个国营出版社经年为儿童刊行着书籍。近二十年来，它们为儿童印行的书籍已有七亿一千四百万册。
    在苏联，戏剧、电影、无线电，也都有了儿童的一份。一百四十所儿童剧院和偶剧院经常为儿童们演出；许多电影制片厂已为儿童们制作了无数的文艺片、学习片。
    在苏联，对母亲与孩子的保健工作，是国家的重要任务：妇婴咨询所在一九一四年时只九个，一九四八年时已经是七千五百五十二个了。产院床位也已由一九一四年的六千八百二十四个增到十一万七千六百三十个。每一个产妇及患病的儿童都能在妇幼卫生机关得到免费治疗。
    过去和现在，在资本主义的国度里，生儿养女一直是劳动妇女的痛苦，这在苏联却已成为崇高的天职，并被国家所尊重。从一九四四年到一九四八年，有二万八千五百位十个孩子的母亲荣膺“母亲英雄”称号并获得勋章，二百五十万生养过五个到九个孩子的母亲，获得“母性光荣”勋章或“母性”奖章。
    北朝鲜、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚和保加利亚，在苏联的帮助下，比我们早日获得了全部解放的兄弟国家，孩子们也早日获得了更多的幸福。在这些国度里，劳动妇女及其子女的福利工作，正受着国家的密切注意。以罗马尼亚为例，他们在宪法第二十六条规定着：“母性及未满十八岁的儿童的诊疗，有享受特别医疗之权。”至一九四九年止，国家仅在乡村就已建立起七百三十四座产院，和一千九百四十八座儿童诊所。为保障母亲们参加国家的建设工作，建立了一百八十八所全托托儿所，四百三十五所日托托儿所和二千八百八十八所幼稚园。国家的卫生飞机，更担任着工人子女的高空治疗工作。这就使罗马尼亚共和国成立后的儿童死亡率由百分之十八减少至百分之十。今年，国家更计划使五万七千名工人子女，到设在山上和海边上的夏令营中欢度暑假。
    这是苏联已经走过的道路，也是我们即将踏上的道路。那些响往着幸福远景的孩子们，热爱着孩子们的爸爸、妈妈们，让我们更多地向苏联学习，沿着这条幸福的道路前进吧！
