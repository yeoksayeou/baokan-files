Production Record of a Certain Unit in Southern Xinjiang
　　People say the Northwest is too desolate,
　　But they don't know the Northwest has treasures.
　　Labor can transform the world,
　　The Northwest will surely become paradise.
　　A certain army unit in southern Xinjiang has launched a large-scale production campaign on the banks of the Kashgar River and Yarkand River at the foot of the Pamir Plateau in the western border of the motherland. In just over a month, more than 100,000 mu of wilderness has been turned into fertile fields under the sharp hoes of the people's soldiers. Thousands of newly built canals crisscross the field ridges. Countless tents and newly built barracks are tightly arranged on the endless wilderness.
　　In the production campaign, many vivid model deeds have emerged. Comrade Lu Yuncheng of the artillery squad of the ninth company of a certain division was seriously injured in battle in the past, and a piece of bone was knocked off his right arm. The superiors did not allow him to participate in land reclamation. He said, "Although I am disabled, I guarantee that I will not fall behind others in land reclamation." As a result, he created a new record of one mu and five fen of land per day, the highest in the entire regiment. Li Decai, a Communist Party member of the communications company of a certain division, had blisters all over his hands while reclaiming wasteland, and blood stained the hoe handle red. The leading comrades wanted him to rest. He said, "I cannot stand outside the production front." He continued to reclaim wasteland. Finally, the leadership ordered him to rest. He still made suggestions, saying, "I can't reclaim wasteland, but I can still exchange labor with the cooks to deliver tea, meals, and firewood." These people's soldiers have shed much blood and sweat for the people in the war. Today, they are diligently and happily shouldering the dual tasks of defending the national defense and developing production.
　　The border of the motherland, which was once called a desolate place, is now changing its face day by day under the labor of thousands of people's soldiers. As the soldier poet Yang Rusheng of the fourth company of a certain regiment said, "People say the Northwest is too desolate, but they don't know the Northwest has treasures; labor can transform the world, the Northwest will surely become paradise."

　　南疆某部生产记
    人说西北太荒凉  不知西北有宝藏
    劳动能够翻天地  西北定会变天堂
    南疆某军在祖国西陲帕米尔高原下的喀什噶尔河与叶尔羌河两岸，掀起了大规模的生产运动。一个多月时间内，在人民战士锋锐的镢头下，十余万亩荒野，变成了良田。界垅间纵横着千百条新修的水渠。一望无际的原野上，紧排着无数的帐棚和新建的营房。
    在生产运动中，出现了很多生动的模范事迹。某师九连炮班鲁云成同志，过去在战斗中屡负重伤，他的右臂被打掉了一片骨头。上级不让他参加开荒。他说：“虽然我是残废，但开起荒来保险不落在人后边。”结果，他创造了一天一亩五分地的全团最高纪录。某师通讯连共产党员李德财，开荒时两手长满了泡，血把镢把都染红了。领导同志要他去休息。他说：“我不能站在生产战线外面。”仍旧继续开荒。最后领导上命令他去休息。他还提意见说：“我不能开荒；但还可以和炊事员变工送茶、送饭、烧火。”这些人民的战士，在战争中不知为人民流过多少血汗。今天，他们又辛勤而愉快地担负起捍卫国防、发展生产的双重任务。
    祖国的边疆，以前曾被人称为荒凉之地，现在正在千万个人民战士的劳动下一天一天地改变着它的面貌。正如某团四连战士诗人杨洳生所说：“人说西北太荒凉，不知西北有宝藏；劳动能够翻天地，西北定会变天堂。”
