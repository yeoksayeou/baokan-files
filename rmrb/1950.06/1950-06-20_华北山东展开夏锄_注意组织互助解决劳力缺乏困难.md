　　Huaibei and Shandong are launching summer weeding
    Pay attention to organizing mutual assistance to solve the problem of labor shortage
    [Our Newspaper News] Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Summer weeding of crops has been widely launched in North China and Shandong Province. After completing spring plowing and sowing, summer weeding is an important link in ensuring the realization of the grain and cotton production increase plan this year. To this end, local people's governments have called on farmers to actively weed.
    Shanxi Province put forward the slogan of "weeding and protecting seedlings." More than 320 cadres have been dispatched to the countryside in the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi to mobilize farmers to weed and protect cotton seedlings. Most of the more than 2 million mu of cotton fields planted this year in the province had been weeded for the first time before the wheat harvest, and some had begun the second weeding. Farmers in Guanghua Village, Ronghe County, have cleared all weeds from inside and outside the village, roadsides, and corners of the land, eliminating the conditions for the spread of cotton aphids. Hebei Province began thinning and weeding cotton fields in early May, and other autumn crops have also begun to be weeded. Jixian County has completed the first weeding throughout the county. In the summer weeding, the people's governments at all levels in the province paid attention to mobilizing women, children, and other semi-labor forces to go to the fields to assist in the work. According to statistics from 54 villages in Anguo and other three counties alone, there were more than 3,400 children weeding. In Pingyuan Province, all the seedling fields of cotton, sorghum, and millet throughout the province have been weeded for the first time. The climate in Chahar and Suiyuan provinces is relatively cold. In early June, Wudong and Fengzhen counties in Suiyuan Province and Chicheng County in Chahar Province also began weeding. Balin Left Banner, Buhate Banner, Keshiketeng Banner, and Kailu County in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are starting to weed wheat, sorghum, corn, and other autumn crops.
    In Shandong Province, large seedling fields such as sorghum and corn have generally been weeded for the first time, and small seedling fields such as millet and rice are also rushing to weed.
    In the summer weeding, the people's governments at all levels paid attention to leading and organizing farmers' labor mutual aid to solve the difficulties of labor shortage. At the same time, they also paid attention to solving the difficulties of farmers' shortage of agricultural tools. In disaster areas, the people's governments paid special attention to solving the rations needed by the victims in summer weeding. The people's governments in the disaster areas of Shandong and Chicheng County in Chahar Province are distributing summer weeding relief grain and loan grain.

　　华北山东展开夏锄
    注意组织互助解决劳力缺乏困难
    【本报讯】新华社消息：华北区和山东省等地农作物夏锄已普遍展开。在完成了春耕播种后，夏季锄苗即为今年保证实现粮棉增产计划的一个重要环节。为此，各地人民政府均号召农民积极锄苗。
    山西省提出了“锄草护苗”的口号。晋南产棉区各县已派遣三百二十多个干部下乡，发动农民锄草以保护棉苗。该省今年所种的二百余万亩棉田，在收麦以前大部已锄了头遍，部分已开始锄二遍。荣河县光华等村的农民，并把村内村外路边地角的一切杂草都已铲得精光，消灭了棉蚜传播的条件。河北省在五月初就开始了棉田的间苗和锄草，其他各种秋禾均已开始锄苗。蓟县全县已锄过了头遍。该省各级人民政府在夏锄中注意了动员妇女儿童等半劳动力下地协助工作，仅据安国等三个县中的五十四个村的统计，下地拔草的儿童即达三千四百余人。平原省全省所有棉花、高粱和谷子的苗田都已锄完头遍。察、绥两省气候较寒，六月初，绥远省的武东、丰镇和察哈尔的赤城等县，也已开始锄苗。内蒙自治区的巴林左旗、布哈特旗、克什克腾旗和开鲁县等地，正开始锄小麦和高粱、玉米等秋禾。
    山东全省高粱、玉米等大苗地一般已锄过头遍，谷子、稻子等小苗地也正在赶锄。
    各地人民政府在夏锄中，均注意领导和组织农民劳动互助，以解决劳动力的困难。同时，并注意解决农民短缺农具的困难。在灾区，人民政府特别注意解决灾民夏锄中所需的口粮。山东灾区和察省赤城县等地人民政府正在发放夏锄救济粮和贷粮。
