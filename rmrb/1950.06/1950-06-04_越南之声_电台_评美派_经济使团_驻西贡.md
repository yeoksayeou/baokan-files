    Comments on US Sending "Economic Mission" to Saigon
    Points out that US imperialism wants to use this mission to completely drive out French colonialists from Indochina
    [Xinhua News Agency, dated 3rd] Vietnam News Agency on the 1st cited a recent commentary by "Voice of Vietnam" Radio on the news that US imperialists will send a "special economic mission" to be stationed in Saigon, stating: The establishment of a US "economic mission" headed by Blum in Indochina is new proof of the US attempt to directly participate in the Indochina colonial war. It wants to turn Indochina into an aggression base for suppressing the ever-increasing people's liberation movement and a military base for the new war that international reactionaries are preparing. This new action by the United States also shows that Wall Street recognizes the incompetence of the French colonialists in Indochina, who have suffered repeated failures in the past five years. The rulers in Washington want to use this "economic mission" to ensure that the so-called US "aid" can be used according to their will; at the same time, it wants to completely drive out the French colonialists from Indochina, just as British forces were excluded from the whole of Greece by the United States.
    The commentary ended by saying that the people of Indochina strongly oppose the US imperialists' plot to turn Indochina into a base of aggression. Therefore, the US attempt will encounter serious failure.

　　“越南之声”电台
    评美派“经济使团”驻西贡
    指出美帝想靠这使团，把法国殖民者完全赶出印度支那
    【新华社三日讯】越南通讯社一日引“越南之声”电台最近评论美帝国主义者将派“特别经济使团”长驻西贡的消息称：美国在印度支那设立一个以布拉姆为首的美国“经济使团”，是美国企图直接参预印度支那殖民战争的新的证明。它想把印度支那变为镇压日益增涨的人民解放运动的侵略基地，并作为国际反动派正在准备中的新战争的军事基地。美国这一新的行动，也表示了华尔街认识到过去五年来屡遭失败的法国殖民者在印度支那的无能。华盛顿的统治者们想靠这个“经济使团”，来保证所谓美“援”能按其意旨使用；同时它想把法国殖民者完全赶出印度支那，就像英国势力曾被美国排除出整个希腊一样。
    评论末称，印度支那人民强烈地反对美帝国主义者把印度支那变为侵略基地的阴谋。因此美国的企图将遭遇严重的失败。
