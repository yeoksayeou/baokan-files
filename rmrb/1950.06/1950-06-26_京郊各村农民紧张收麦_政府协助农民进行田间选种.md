　　Suburban Beijing Farmers Tensely Harvest Wheat
    Government Assists Farmers in Field Seed Selection
    [Our Newspaper Dispatch] Correspondent Leng Lin reports: The villages in the suburbs of Beijing have now entered the wheat harvest season and are carrying out field seed selection work. North of Tucheng, many farmers plant red awn wheat, which has a higher yield. Near Deshengmen, the maximum yield per mu can reach one stone and two dou. Farmers say this is an eight-tenths harvest. According to statistics from the 423 mu of wheat fields in Sijie, 144 mu yielded one stone and two dou. Outside Tucheng, the wheat varieties are more mixed, with the highest yield being one stone, the lowest three dou, and the general yield around six dou. The Dajiaoting Mutual Aid Group in the eastern suburbs has transitioned into a wheat-pulling team, pulling wheat from 12:00 midnight to the next morning. They pull wheat for others, providing water but not food, with wages of ten to twelve jin of corn per mu. This corrects the past wasteful phenomenon of not paying wages and only providing excessive eating and drinking. In Dajiaoting and Balizhuang, more than two hundred threshing floors have been prepared for use by the newly liberated farmers. In the southern suburbs, harvesting takes place in the evening when the weather is cool, the wheat grains do not fall off, and it is not prickly. In the western suburbs, the troops stationed in Xiyuan, Dayouzhuang, Changxindian, and Zhangguozhuang are actively helping farmers with the harvest. It is estimated that Shijingshan District, Dayu Chengzi in Mentougou, and other places will complete the harvest by the 25th or 26th of this month. Much of the wheat in the suburbs is infected with jaundice, and it is estimated that yields will be reduced by 20-30%. In Mentoucun, Dazhongsi, and Dongbeiwang in the western suburbs, more than one hundred mu of wheat fields have contracted water rust, which will reduce production by about 30%.
    During the wheat harvest, the government is organizing farmers to carry out field seed selection. The severity of wheat diseases this year has directly educated farmers and made them pay attention to seed selection. After extensive publicity and mobilization in Shijingshan District, farmers' concerns about trouble and selecting their own wheat fields were dispelled. The slogans "If you select seeds in the field this year, you will have a good harvest next year" and "Like begets like, good seeds make good harvests" were put forward. Communist Party members and Youth League members were called upon to take the lead and set an example, with each party and league member selecting ten jin of wheat seeds by ear. The North Suburbs organized seed selection in three ways: First, adjustment was carried out on a neighborhood basis. Second, seven or eight households freely combined into a group. Third, seed selection was organized on an administrative village basis. In the western suburbs, working groups led farmers in seed selection. In Shuanghuaishu, selection was carried out by section. In Madaomiao, several good wheat varieties were selected and exchanged for planting within the village using a reasonable exchange method. In Xiaojiahe, the good wheat from the Xinying Natural Village in Hebei was used as seed. In Fengtai District, a seed selection committee was established to lead the work. Shijingshan District emphasized the method of ear selection in the field, supplemented by section selection, and organized the masses to remove inferior and miscellaneous plants in the selected wheat fields. At present, 3,194 mu of wheat fields have been selected in 36 villages in the northern suburbs, with Xiaohongmang and Heshangtou being the most common. In Dayouzhuang in the western suburbs, fifteen households selected 31.5 mu of wheat fields. In Zhangguozhuang in Fengtai District, 150 mu of Henan white variety have been selected, and in Baicaowa, 45 mu of Henan white variety have been selected. In the southern suburbs, the masses mostly selected Xiaohongmang, Heshangtou, and Dabaimang. According to farmers, the Henan white variety has large ears and fewer jaundice diseases; the characteristic of Xiaohongmang is that it is wind-resistant, resistant to black jaundice, and has a high yield, yielding one stone and two dou per mu. The advantage of Heshangtou and Dabaimang wheat is that they are of good color and sell for a high price.

　　京郊各村农民紧张收麦
    政府协助农民进行田间选种
    【本报讯】通讯员冷林报道：京郊各村现已进入麦收时际，并展开田间选种工作。北郊土城以内多种红芒麦种，产量较多，德胜门附近一带每亩最多可打一石二斗，农民说这是八成年景。以四街四二三亩麦田统计，打一石二的有一四四亩。土城外麦种较杂，产量最高打一石，最低打三斗，一般打六斗左右。东郊大郊亭互助组已转为拔麦组，每晚十二时至翌晨拔麦。替旁人拔，管水不管饭，每亩工资玉米十斤至十二斤，改正了过去不给工资，只管大吃大喝的浪费现象。大郊亭八里庄已准备了二百余场子，为新翻身的农民使用。南郊晚上收割，天气凉快，麦粒不脱，不扎手。西郊西苑、大有庄一带及长辛店张郭庄在麦收中，当地驻军纷纷帮助农民收割。石景山区及门头沟大峪城子等地，估计本月二十五、六日即可全部收完。郊区麦子多染有黄疸病，估计将减收二三成。西郊门头村，大钟寺、东北旺一百余亩麦田发生水锈，将减产三成左右。
    在麦收中，政府组织农民进行田间选种。尤其今年麦子的病害严重，更直接教育了农民，注意了选种工作。石景山区经过广泛宣传动员，打消农民怕麻烦，怕挑选自己麦田等思想顾虑，提出“今年田里选了种，明年庄稼收成好”，“龙生龙，凤生凤，好种籽才有好收成”等口号。并号召共产党员、青年团员起带头模范作用，每个党、团员要穗选麦籽十斤。北郊组织选种有三种方式：第一，以闾为单位进行调剂。第二，自由结合七、八户为一组。第三，以行政村为单位选种。西郊由工作组领导农民进行，双槐树按片选，马道庙选出几户好麦种，在村内用合理交换方式换种，萧家河把河北新营自然村一带的好麦作种籽。丰台区成立了选种委员会领导工作。石景山区强调田间穗选方法，以片选方法补助，并在片选的麦地中，组织群众进行去劣去杂的工作。目前北郊三十六个村中已选出三、一九四亩麦地，其中以小红芒、和尚头为最多。西郊大有庄十五户选出三十一亩五分麦地。丰台区张郭庄已选一百五十亩河南白种，白草洼已选了四十五亩河南白种。南郊群众多选小红芒、和尚头及大白芒。据农民谈：河南白种穗大，黄疸病少；小红芒种的特点是抗风，抗黑疸，产量大，每亩可打一石二。和尚头及大白芒小麦的好处是成色好，价钱高。
