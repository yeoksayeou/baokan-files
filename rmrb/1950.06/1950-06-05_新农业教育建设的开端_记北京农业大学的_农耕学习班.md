　　The Beginning of New Agricultural Education Construction
    A Record of the "Farming Study Class" at Beijing Agricultural University
    By Our Reporter Jin Feng

    I. The Establishment of a New Policy

    Beijing Agricultural University, formed last December by the merger of the agricultural colleges of the former North China University, Tsinghua University, Peking University, and the Department of Agronomy of Fu Jen Catholic University, has preliminarily implemented a new agricultural education policy oriented towards agricultural production and integrating theory and practice, that is, a policy integrating education, research, and production. The implementation of the new policy is reflected in the reform of the academic system and, more specifically, in the establishment of the "Farming Study Class."

    The Agricultural University broke with the old four-year academic program and is now piloting a new academic system that includes four teaching stages. The first stage is seven months (from September to March of the following year), during which students mainly study basic science courses such as mathematics, chemistry, and zoology and botany. The second stage is six months (from April to September, including the entire production season from spring plowing to autumn harvest), during which students go to the Lugouqiao Farm (in coordination with the Miaofeng Mountain Forest Farm) for farming studies. The third stage is two years, during which students begin to study basic agricultural science and compulsory and elective courses in their respective departments. The fourth stage is one year, during which students conduct research work under the guidance of teachers; or go to internship positions to work, and report on their work, problems, and experiences to the guiding teachers at any time.

    The new academic system was established after careful research and heated debate. Some people worried that it would "lower academic standards." Some cited foreign and past examples, arguing that "scientific theory" is mainly a product of elaborate laboratories and extensive libraries, and that the task of the Agricultural University is to cultivate talents who can master these "scientific theories" so that they can apply these "scientific theories" to the "backward and ignorant" Chinese countryside; therefore, they opposed "wasting" learning time in production labor in this way. However, when everyone reviewed the past failures in agricultural education, such as "theory divorced from practice," "agricultural students not recognizing crops," and "agricultural science remaining only in laboratories and classrooms," the policy of "agricultural education oriented towards production" was first affirmed; when everyone further considered the agricultural science and technology talents needed for the construction of the new China and the actual situation of Chinese agricultural students (most agricultural students are unfamiliar with the countryside, do not understand farmers, and do not have the habit of production labor), a consensus was gradually reached on the establishment of the new academic system.

    II. Farming Study Class

    At the end of March, more than 580 first-year students, under the leadership of the "Farming Teaching Committee," formed the "Farming Study Class" and went to the Lugouqiao Farm in early April to begin the second stage of study in the new academic system.

    The Farming Study Class is divided into nine teaching stages according to the farming season, such as spring plowing and sowing, harvesting and storage. Each department has established a farming teaching group to offer various lectures in coordination with the various stages of farming study. During the spring plowing stage, they study for half a day and labor for half a day; after listening to lectures, they immediately follow up with labor. For example, after lecturing on "soil improvement," the students go to the field to do soil improvement work. This enables them to verify the theories they hear in class in actual labor; and to discover problems in actual labor and bring them to the classroom to ask teachers for answers. This is a process of recognizing the unity of theory and practice, and also a process of developing a labor perspective.

    III. The Issue of the Unity of Theory and Practice

    When they first arrived at the farm, in terms of labor, they picked up stones, dug up tree roots, planted trees, and leveled the ground. Some students felt that these were just "simple labor" and that they could not learn anything, so they felt depressed. Some students were enthusiastically trying to discover and study problems from actual labor: they wanted to study whether a stone was igneous rock or sedimentary rock when they saw one; they wanted to study the cause of the red outside and white inside of peanuts; some students were also enthusiastically experimenting with grafting and hybridization. However, many problems were discovered, and they could not be solved one by one; the experiments were not successful either. So they began to doubt: should they learn more "theory" first and then relate it to practice, or should they learn practice first and then relate it to theory? They thought that they had not learned enough "theory," so the connection to practice was not very effective.

    But actual labor educated them.

    Lu Zhihao, the head of the first branch class, and some students came up with ways to organize labor such as "great convergence," "small convergence," and "running in opposite directions" when picking up stones, which increased students' interest in labor and the efficiency of picking up stones, and the work originally scheduled for fifteen days was completed in one day. He also came up with a way to tie wooden sticks to the tree roots and pull them down with ropes when digging up tree roots, which reduced the original two-hour work to a dozen minutes. This made the students realize that picking up stones and digging up tree roots is not simple, and that theory and knowledge can be generated in the process of labor.

    The students participated in more production labor—preparing the land, building ridges, digging ditches, selecting seeds, soaking seeds, sowing seeds, etc., and gradually recognized some field crops, learned how to use some agricultural tools, and understood some farming knowledge. They realized that these actual labor is real production knowledge. They gradually realized that the so-called agricultural scientific theory is generated, enriched, and improved from agricultural production, and then guides agricultural production in turn. They realized that theory and practice are unified in the production process, not opposed or separated. Therefore, they reflected on the idea of "learning theory first and then relating it to practice," in fact, that was to understand theory only as "theory" in books and laboratories; they also criticized the impatient idea of trying to dig out a theory with one hoe. In this way, in actual production labor, they experienced and affirmed the correctness of the teaching policy of "the unity of theory and practice."

    IV. A Thorough Bath in the Mud

    At the same time, in the process of labor, they were developing a labor perspective. When they experienced the difficulty of labor, they began to cherish the fruits of labor. When a vegetable ridge they had built was accidentally stepped on by someone, they felt very sorry. From this, they thought of how heartbroken the farmers would feel when most of the fruits of their hard work were taken away by the landlords in the past! This enabled them to have a relatively deep understanding of the crimes of the landlord class. Their thoughts and feelings also began to change: they began to cherish agricultural tools as much as they loved their pens. When the wind rose, they no longer just admired the ups and downs of a wheat wave when they saw the field, but began to worry about the damage of the wind disaster to the crops. They no longer held an extremely disgusting attitude towards manure, but realized that it is an extremely useful fertilizer for crops, so they were afraid that there would be too little when cleaning the toilets. In this way, in labor, they gradually washed away the past dirty consciousness of the exploiting classes, and began to nurture the thoughts and feelings of the working people. "Combining with the peasants" was no longer an abstract empty talk for them, but had concrete content, and no longer stayed in subjective wishes but was seen in actual actions.

    V. Teaching Starts from Practice

    Conducting teaching in coordination with these labor production is also a difficult learning process for the teachers. Some teachers have tried to proceed from the "labor perspective" and "production perspective" to conduct teaching in connection with actual production: for example, Mr. Chen Yusheng's report on "human excrement and urine" analyzed the composition and function of human excrement and urine and proposed methods of preservation. After listening to it, the students not only understood the value of human manure, but immediately set about transforming the toilets; Mr. Yu Zaixun's lecture on "cooperative farms" enabled the students to understand not only the nature and situation of the existing cooperative farms, but also the path of development of individual agricultural economy in the new democratic society; Mr. Feng Zhaolin lectured on "soil improvement," leading the students to the field to observe in practice, comparing the stone-accumulated land of the farm with the land of the neighboring villagers, and explaining to the students that these two pieces of land belong to the same soil system; however, the villagers' land grew very well because they picked up stones, opened wells, and applied organic fertilizer, and they harvested three crops in two years; while the farm's land was very bad and only harvested one crop a year because no one had managed it in the past. So the students set about picking up stones and carrying out the labor of improving the soil. These teachings, which were connected with practice, started from practice, and guided practice, were warmly welcomed by the students. However, because the habit of frequently using foreign textbooks in the past could not be changed for a while, and it also took a period of time to collect teaching materials in the actual production process for teaching in connection with practice, the teaching of some courses was still inevitably divorced from practice, and still needs to be overcome.

    VI. Preliminary Results

    The achievements of the Farming Study Class are affirmative. When the teachers and students of the Farming Study Class reported their teaching, ideological gains, and production gains (they planted more than 6,000 trees, sowed cotton and vegetables on 205 mu, and improved 100 mu of soil) at the summary meeting of the spring farming study at the Agricultural University, when they enthusiastically shouted "It is the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who have made us close to the truth at once!", an old professor of the Agricultural University said with emotion: "Congratulations to Lugouqiao for becoming the starting point of new agricultural education construction!"

　　新农业教育建设的开端
    记北京农业大学的“农耕学习班”
    本报记者  金凤
    一、新方针的确立
    由前华北大学、清华、北大三校的农学院和辅仁大学农学系在去年十二月合并组成的北京农业大学，已经初步执行了面向农业生产、理论和实际一致的新农业教育方针，也就是教育、研究、生产三位一体的方针。新方针的实施表现在学制改革方面，更具体地表现在“农耕学习班”的成立。
    农大打破了旧有的四年制的学程，正试行着包括四个教学阶段的新学制。第一阶段是七个月（从九月到来春三月），学生主要学习数学、化学、动植物等基本科学课程。第二阶段六个月（从四月到九月，包括春耕到秋收的整个生产季节），学生到芦沟桥农场（配合妙峰山林场）进行农耕学习。第三阶段是两年，学生开始分系学习基本农业科学和本系的必修课和选修课。第四个阶段是一年，学生在教师指导下进行研究工作；或到实习工作岗位上去工作，并随时向指导的教师报告工作情况、问题和经验。
    新学制确立前曾经过慎重的研究和热烈的争论。有些人担忧会“降低了学术水平”。有些人引用了一些外国的、过去的例子，认为“科学理论”主要是精致的实验室和宏博的书室中的产品，而农大的任务就是在于培养能掌握这些“科学理论”的人才，使他们能把这些“科学理论”应用到“落后愚昧”的中国农村中去；因此他们反对将学习时间这样整段地“浪费”在生产劳动中。但是，当大家回顾了过去农业教育中“理论脱离实际”、“农科学生认不得庄稼”以及“农业科学仅仅停留在实验室和课堂”等失败的教训时，“农业教育面向生产”的方针首先被肯定下来了；当大家进一步联系到新中国建设所需要的农业科学技术人才以及中国农科学生的实际情况（大部分农科学生不熟悉农村，不了解农民，没有生产劳动的习惯）时，对于新学制的建立逐渐取得了一致的看法。
    二、农耕学习班
    三月底，一年级学生五百八十多人，在“农耕教学委员会”的领导下，组成了“农耕学习班”，四月初赴芦沟桥农场开始了新学制中第二阶段的学习。
    农耕学习班根据农耕季节划分为春耕播种、收获与贮藏等九个教学阶段。各系则成立了农耕教学小组，配合着农耕学习的各个阶段开设各种课程的讲座。在春耕阶段中，他们半日上课，半日劳动；听课以后，立即跟着劳动。譬如讲了“土壤改良”以后，学生们就下地去做改良土壤工作。这就使得他们能够将课堂上所听到的学理，在实际劳动中得到印证；又在实际劳动中发现问题，提到课堂上来请求教师解答。这是一个理论与实际一致的认识过程，也是一个锻炼劳动观点的过程。
    三、理论和实际一致的问题
    刚下农场，在劳动方面，他们拾石子、刨树根、种树和平地。一部分学生觉得这些只是“简单的劳动”，学习不到什么东西，于是感到苦闷。一部分学生倒是热心地要从实际劳动中发现和研究问题：他们看到一块石子就要研究那是火成岩还是水成岩；看到花生外边红里面白又要研究它的成因；一部分学生还热心地试验着嫁接和杂交。但是问题发现很多，不能一一解决；实验也没有成功。于是他们就发生怀疑：究竟还是多学一些“理论”，再来联系实际，还是学了实际再去联系理论。他们以为还是“理论”学得少了，因此联系实际没有多少效果。
    但实际劳动教育了他们。
    第一分班主任陆志豪和一些学生在拾石子时想出了“大会师”、“小会师”、“相背而驰”等组织劳动的方式，使得学生劳动的兴趣和拾石子的效率都提高了，原定十五天的工作一天就干完。他又在刨树根时想出将木棒缚在树根上，用绳子拉倒树根的办法，使原来需要两小时的工作在十几分钟内就完成。这就使得学生认识到拾石子和刨树根也不简单，劳动过程中尽能产生理论和学问。
    学生们参加了更多的生产劳动——整地、筑畦、开沟、选种、浸种、播种等等，逐渐认识了一些田间作物，学会了一些农具的使用，懂得了一些农耕知识。他们了解到这些实际劳动就是真实的生产知识。他们逐渐认识到所谓农业科学理论就是从农业生产中产生、丰富和提高，再反过来指导农业生产的。他们认识到在生产过程中理论与实际是统一而不是对立、分立的。因此，他们反省了那种“学了理论再来联系实际”的想法，事实上那是把理论仅仅了解为书本上和实验室的“理论”；他们也批判了一镐想刨出个理论来的性急的想法。这样，他们在实际的生产劳动中，体会和肯定了“理论与实际一致”的教学方针的正确。
    四、泥土中洗了个翻身澡
    同时，在劳动过程中，他们锻炼着劳动观点。当他们体会到了劳动的艰难，他们开始珍惜劳动的成果。当他们筑成的菜畦被别人不小心地踩了一脚，他们感到十分惋惜。由此，他们联想到过去农民辛辛苦苦劳动的成果大部分被地主夺去时将感到如何的心痛！这就使得他们能够比较深刻地认识到地主阶级的罪恶。思想感情也开始变化了：他们开始爱惜农具，像爱他们的钢笔一样。大风起来，他们看到田野时不再光是欣赏一片麦浪的起伏，却开始担心风灾对于庄稼的损害。对于粪尿不再抱着极端厌恶的态度，而是认识到这是对于农作物极其有用的肥料，因此掏厕时就唯恐它太少了。这样，他们在劳动中逐渐洗涤过去的肮脏的剥削阶级的意识，而开始滋生劳动人民的思想感情。“和农民结合”对于他们不再是一句抽象的空话而有具体的内容了，不再停留在主观的愿望而是见之于实际的行动了。
    五、教学从实际出发
    配合着这些劳动生产进行教学，对于先生们也是一个艰难的学习过程。一些先生们尝试着从“劳动观点”和“生产观点”出发，联系实际生产来进行教学：譬如陈禹绳先生的“人粪尿”的报告，分析了人粪尿的成分和作用，提出了保存的办法，学生们听了以后不但由此明白了人粪的价值，并立即着手改造厕所；裕载勋先生讲的“合作农场”，使学生们不但明白了现有的合作农场的性质和情况，而且明白了新民主主义社会中的个体农业经济发展的道路；冯兆林先生讲授“土壤改良”，领着学生到地里去实际观察，比较了农场的石子累积的土地和相邻的老乡的土地，向学生说明这两块土地同属一个土系；但老乡的土地由于拾去了石子、开了水井和上了有机肥料，地里的庄稼就长得很好，而且两年三熟；而农场的土地则由于过去无人经营，地里收成就很坏，一年只一熟。于是学生们就着手拾去石子，具体进行改良土壤的劳动。这些联系了实际，从实际出发而又指导了实际的教学，都受到学生热烈的欢迎。但由于过去经常搬用外国教材的习惯还不是一时能改得过来，而联系实际的教学要到实际生产过程中搜集教材也需要一段时间，因此有些课程的教学还不免脱离实际，尚待继续加以克服。
    六、初步的成果
    农耕学习班的成绩是肯定的，当农耕学习班的师生在农大春耕学习总结大会上报告着一个月来他们的教学、思想收获和生产收获（他们植树六千多株，播种棉花、菜蔬二百零五亩，改良土壤一百亩），当他们热烈地喊出“是共产党、毛主席使我们一下靠近了真理”时，农大一位老教授感动地说：“恭贺芦沟桥，成为新农业教育建设的起点！”
