Ningjin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Loans Out 2 Million Jin of Coarse Grains
    The Ningjin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xingtai Prefecture, Hebei Province, has been "exchanging coarse grains for fine grains" to help the masses solve difficulties in production and life, and has developed its membership in conjunction with the establishment of the cooperative. The cooperative received over 1,583,000 jin of coarse grains allocated by the prefectural cooperative, plus 500,000 jin of local corn from the county. All of these were loaned out before the wheat harvest. This helped the masses purchase 168 waterwheels, repair 391 old waterwheels, and repair 313 old wells. This will expand irrigated land and watered land by more than 2,900 mu, increasing grain production by more than 174,000 jin. In addition, it has supported sideline production, increasing the actual income of farmers. In conjunction with the establishment of the cooperative, 16 new and renovated old cooperatives were established, and more than 9,400 new members were recruited.
