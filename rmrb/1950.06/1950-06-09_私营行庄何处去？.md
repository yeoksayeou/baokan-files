Where are Private Banks and Credit Societies Heading?
    Zhang Naiqi

    In May or June of last year, I published two articles on the future of private banks and credit societies, putting forward the following two points:

    1. The number of private banks and credit societies is too large, far exceeding the needs of the people. Those surplus banks and credit societies must quickly switch to other businesses or merge.

    2. Although private banks and credit societies can still exist for a considerable period, their path is much narrower than that of productive enterprises. Therefore, their only way out is to actively integrate with production and eventually dissolve into production.

    Now, a year later, the answer to the question "Where are private banks and credit societies heading?" can at least only be the above two points for me. However, the general situation of banks and credit societies is much more difficult than it was last year.

    Speaking of numbers, although quite a few have closed down or gone bankrupt in the past year, their total capital is still greatly excessive. As far as I understand, the total deposits of all private banks and credit societies nationwide, converted to the purchasing power of pre-war silver dollars, may be less than 50 million yuan. But before the war, the total deposits of a single private bank's head office and branches exceeded 200 million yuan. Inflation, on the one hand, stimulates the massive establishment of private banks and credit societies, but on the other hand, it inevitably leads to the gradual disappearance of their strength, eventually forming a complete collapse. This is the general process of the economic false prosperity caused by inflation, from development to disillusionment, but it is particularly concentrated in the financial sector. The disaster was clearly left over by the Kuomintang. Thoughtful bankers have been worried about this disaster for many years, and economists have been constantly discussing this issue for many years. The crisis was once exposed after the Japanese surrendered and during the temporary decline and stability of prices during the issuance of pseudo-gold yuan notes, but the final disillusionment of false prosperity occurred after this basic stabilization of the currency value.

    The situation is still developing. Those banks and credit societies with weak foundations, unreasonable organizations, and poor credit have obviously lost the trust of the people. The flow of deposits from small banks and credit societies to large banks (generally from credit societies to banks), and from private banks and credit societies to joint public-private and public banks, has become a universal trend. Therefore, it is entirely possible that more than half of the private banks and credit societies will be eliminated in the future. The stability of the currency value will increase deposits. The increase in number, taking 1936 as an example, may be twenty times the current amount. Those private banks and credit societies that have stood firm through the storms may regain the trust of the people at that time, and deposits will increase by a certain amount. They can move forward again on the path of normal operation.

    In the era of inflation, it is inevitable for banks and credit societies to seek profits through speculation and maintain their survival through high-interest loans. When the situation becomes such that even investing in productive enterprises is speculative, it is truly impossible and unnecessary for any private bank and credit society to deny speculation. High-interest loans are even more obvious: deposits cannot be collected without high interest rates, and naturally loans cannot be made without even higher interest rates. Even state-owned banks are no exception to this. In fact, the interest rate at this time mainly includes compensation for the depreciation of the currency value, and it is reasonable to say that it cannot be too low. After liberation, the speculative behavior of private banks and credit societies has been greatly reduced due to strict management, but high-interest loans cannot be completely eliminated for a while. This allows the excessively large number of banks and credit societies to rely on extremely limited real capital to barely survive—of course, many of them are already living off their capital, and some have even closed down.

    The stability of the currency value inevitably brings about a decrease in interest rates. If borrowing money to purchase goods cannot earn enough to cover the interest on the loan, and even results in losses, who would be willing to borrow money? If there are any, they are either chronically suicidal people drinking poison to quench their thirst, or big adventurers. However, these types of people are the ones that banks and credit societies are unwilling to lend to. Of course, there will be some with particularly high profits who can afford high interest rates, and those who need extremely short-term turnover do not need to excessively care about interest rates, but of course there cannot be many. This has formed the difficult situation in the past period where banks and credit societies had money but could not lend it out. Originally, industrial and commercial enterprises that needed loans had long called for lower interest rates, and state-owned banks also had the task of lowering interest rates in a timely manner. Now, even private banks and credit societies feel that it is necessary to lower interest rates, and the objective situation is completely mature. The current loan interest rate has generally fallen to only one-tenth to one-fifteenth of the highest period; of course, compared to the black market interest rate during the highest period, the drop is far more than this.

    Then the problem comes. If the past loan interest rate was 60-70%, and the deposit interest rate was 20-30%, the bank or credit society could earn a gross profit of 20-30% in addition to the deposit reserve. Now, if the loan interest rate is reduced to 3%, and in slightly higher regions it is no more than 5%, and the deposit interest rate is reduced to a few tenths of a percent to 2-3%, then it is only possible to earn a gross profit of 2-3%. At the same time, deposits have not increased significantly, it is still not easy to issue loans, and expenses have not decreased much, so life is of course even more difficult. According to the trend, interest rates will still have to be lowered, and it is entirely possible that the loan interest rate will be reduced to less than 2% per month this year. At that time, the gross profit between deposits and loans may be less than 1%. If there is no ten-fold or twenty-fold increase in deposits, business will be unsustainable. Such a large increase in deposits can obviously only be limited to a small number of banks and credit societies with a solid foundation, sound organization, and modern management through labor-management consultation. Then it still has to go through a fairly drastic elimination process. "It is necessary to improve quality by reducing quantity, and to achieve normal business by concentrating strength." These are two sentences I wrote last year, and they are still applicable today.

    Taking Shanghai as an example, the current deposits of joint public-private and private banks and credit societies total only 500 billion, which is worth only about 25 million pre-war silver dollars when converted to the price index. But before the war, the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank alone had deposits of more than 100 million yuan in Shanghai. That is to say, the current deposits of all joint public-private and private banks and credit societies in Shanghai are only one-fourth of the local deposits of a single bank before the war. With one-fourth of the deposits of a single bank before the war, it is truly obvious that it is unreasonable, and even ultimately impossible, to maintain the survival of more than 70 banks and credit societies today.

    More seriously, more than half of the current 500 billion deposits are concentrated in four joint public-private banks, and the remaining more than 70 private banks and credit societies account for less than half. Among the private banks and credit societies, the total deposits of the 40% of banks and credit societies, account for only 4% of the total deposits, and each bank has less than 500 million deposits, so how can they survive? Of course, the same or even more serious situation exists elsewhere. For example, in Beijing, there are credit societies with deposits of only 50 million yuan.

    Under the anarchic production of capitalism, the mass bankruptcies of banks and general enterprises were originally supposed to occur cyclically. The situation in the United States after 1929 is a very typical example. The economic development of semi-colonial old China during the period of inflation concentratedly and significantly showed the state of anarchy; and the focus of this expression was the financial sector. The unconditional expansion of quantity brought about an unlimited reduction in quality. Financial professionals also shook their heads and sighed at the deformity of the organization and the ugliness of the style of some newly established banks and credit societies during this period. It would be truly strange if this unreasonable state could be allowed to continue to exist! It is the people's wish and the proper atmosphere of the new country to allow the progressive and solid ones to be retained and the backward and fragile ones to be eliminated through the elimination of the trend of the times.

    All accusations directed at others are unreasonable. Should state-owned banks not compete? The New Democratic state-owned banks must not allow the financial market related to the national economic lifeline to be manipulated by private capital. It cannot detach itself from the masses and take the capitalist path of "bank of banks". It must achieve the goal of completely leading the financial market by directly serving the people. Moreover, the deposit interest rate of the People's Bank of China is generally lower than that of private banks and credit societies, so there is no question of competition. The amount of private deposits it absorbs is also very small, and even if all of it is given to private banks and credit societies, it will never be able to maintain the survival of all banks and credit societies.

    Should the state's management not be too strict? Facts have proven that this is precisely necessary to prevent speculation, and preventing speculation is for the benefit of banks and credit societies, and even more so for the benefit of the vast number of depositors. If there were no relatively strict management, the disasters caused by those private banks and credit societies that did not follow the right path and the damage suffered by depositors would be even more unfathomable.

    Is it because the burden of donations and taxes and public bonds is too heavy? Obviously, even if the burden of donations and taxes and public bonds is completely exempted, those banks and credit societies with weak foundations will not be able to exist. Generally speaking, the private banks and credit societies that have gone bankrupt are precisely not the ones that bear a lot of donations and taxes and public bonds.

    Is it due to the competition of joint public-private banks? They do not possess any privileges, but only have more state management. The people trust the state and trust this extra state management, so they send their deposits there. There is no reason to reject this, and it cannot be considered unreasonable competition.

    Is it because the labor demands are too high and the expenses are too large? The labor side should certainly conduct self-criticism, and the capital side can also negotiate and resolve issues with the labor side in accordance with the law. The state's policy is "both labor and capital benefit", and it certainly does not want to see the capital side harm the labor side, or the labor side harm the interests of the capital side. However, in addition to negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and even court judgments, it can never interfere with the actions of the capital side or the labor side within the scope of the law. In reality, even if wages are reduced to the minimum and personnel are reduced to the minimum, private banks and credit societies will never be able to retain all of them.

    The policy of "taking into consideration both public and private interests" is definite. However, one prerequisite is indispensable: private enterprises must be beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and only if they are needed by the people can they receive state care. Those private enterprises that do not meet the requirements of the Common Program will of course not be guaranteed by the Common Program. In addition, there is a basic condition: private enterprises must be suitable for the requirements of the times and the environment in terms of organization and equipment. "Taking into consideration both public and private interests" is only a policy that can help the development of those private enterprises that are suitable for survival; but it is by no means a panacea that can cure all incurable diseases. Enterprises with unsuitable production conditions, even state-owned ones, must also be eliminated, not just private ones. That is "beyond help" and cannot be taken care of.

    The economic situation has obviously improved, but from the perspective of various departments and units of industry, commerce, and finance, any improvement will not be comprehensive - those that do not meet the needs of the people and do not meet the conditions will still be eliminated. Private banks and credit societies must firmly grasp this opportunity for improvement. Those that can switch to other businesses should resolutely switch to other businesses. Those that really have no other way to think of will have to close down and wait. Observation is useless. It is easier to switch to other businesses during times of improvement, and closing down may also reduce some difficulties. It must be believed that no future economic prosperity can accommodate all existing private banks and credit societies. That kind of false prosperity that could accommodate so many banks and credit societies will never appear again in the future.

    Then the question comes: How should we switch to other businesses? This is not an easy question to answer, and it is even impossible to answer in this short article. Although the government's guidance has been unfolding in a planned and step-by-step manner, any guidance is unlikely to compensate for the shortcomings of the subjective conditions of each enterprise. For example, land reclamation can accommodate a large amount of capital and manpower; but this is obviously not suitable for the transfer of banks and credit societies. Many industries that require advanced technology can be developed; but even the state does not have the conditions to handle those industries, let alone private individuals? Today, only two points can be said: First, passively, we must never transfer to commerce again, nor can we transfer to industries with too low technical conditions and too easy to handle, as they are generally already in surplus. Second, actively, the two principles of "facing the countryside" and "facing the people" are still correct, but they must be deeper and higher. For example, in the area around Wuxi, the equipment for power irrigation of farmland is already in surplus, but in the more distant inland areas, this is still in great need. Agricultural services with higher technology are of course needed in many places.

    Joint operations, mergers, and jointly organizing investment companies are all encouraged. Internal organizational adjustments and changes in operating methods are also completely necessary. From the perspective of the financial industry, joint public-private operation is a relatively narrow path. Because, obviously, changing the surplus of private ownership into the surplus of joint public-private ownership cannot solve the problem of surplus, and joint public-private operation must also meet certain conditions.

    The main thing today is to rely on the masses. The responsible people of private banks and credit societies are more familiar with the affairs of private banks and credit societies than we are. They should collectively discuss their common future. The employees of banks and credit societies are bound to be concerned about their future, and this discussion can be further expanded to all employees. Banks and credit societies have a very wide range of contacts in society, and they can further consult with the public. As a result of gathering ideas, all kinds of creations will be produced.

### 私营行庄何处去？

　　私营行庄何处去？
    章乃器
    去年五六月间，我曾经发表了两篇关于私营银行钱庄前途的文字，提出了下列两点：
    一、私营行庄家数太多，远超过了人民的需要。那些过剩的行庄必须赶快转业或合并。
    二、私营行庄虽然还可以存在一个相当长的时期，但比起生产事业来，道路却狭窄的多。因此，它们的出路只能是积极的与生产结合，最后融化在生产里面。
    如今事隔经年，对于“私营行庄何处去”这一问题的答案，至少在我还只能提出上述两点；但，一般行庄的情况，却已经比去年困难得多了。
    说家数，一年来停业倒闭的虽然已经数不在少；但从它们所拥有的资力来说，依然是大大的过剩。依我所了解，全国所有私营行庄的存款总额，折合战前银元的购买力，可能还不到五千万元。但在战前，一家私营银行总分行的存款总额，就有超过二亿元的。通货膨胀一面会刺激私营行庄的大量增设，然而，另一面又必然会使它们的实力逐渐消失，最后形成了整个崩溃的局面。这是通货膨胀所造成的经济虚伪繁荣由发展到幻灭的一般过程，但特别集中表现在金融事业。祸害显然是国民党遗留下来的，有思想的银行家多年以来就已经为这一祸害而耽忧，经济学者多年以来也在不断讨论这一个问题。危机曾经在日帝投降以后和伪金元券发行时期物价暂时下跌和平稳当中暴露过，但虚伪繁荣最后的幻灭，却在这次币值基本稳定以后。
    形势还在继续的发展。那些基础薄弱，组织不合理、信用不良的行庄，显然已经失去了人民的信任。存款由小的行庄流入大的行庄（一般的由钱庄流入银行），由私营行庄流入公私合营和公营银行，已经成为普遍的趋势。因此，私营行庄今后再有半数以上的淘汰，是完全可能的。币值的稳定会使存款增加。增加的数目，如以一九三六年为例，可能是目下的二十倍。那些经过了风浪依然能够站得住的私营行庄，到那时可能重新获得人民的信任，存款会有一定数量的增加。它们可以在正常经营的道路上再向前进。
    在通货膨胀时代，行庄要靠投机觅取利润，靠高利贷维持生存，都是必然的。当局势变成连投资生产事业都带着投机性，任何私营行庄要否认投机，真是不可能也不必要的了。高利贷更是众目昭彰的事情：非出高利息便收不到存款，贷款自然更非高利不可。这一点，连公营银行都不能例外。实际上，这个时候的利息，主要是包括币值跌落的赔偿在内的，照理说也是不能不高的。解放以后的私营行庄，投机行为是因为严格管理而大大的减少了，高利贷却一时还不能不放任其存在。这就使得家数过多的行庄能够依靠实值极其有限的资力，苟延残喘的支持下去——当然，内中已经有很多已在吃老本，有的而且已经停业了。
    币值的稳定必然带来了利率的下降。倘使借款进货而赚不出应付借款的利息，甚至还要赔了本，还有谁愿意借款呢？真有的话，那不是饮鸩止渴的慢性自杀者，便是大冒险家。但，这一类的人物又是行庄所不愿意借给款项的。利润特别高，负担得起高利贷的，和极短期的周转不必过分计较利息的，当然会有一些，但当然不可能多。这就形成了过去一个时期行庄有款放不出去的苦况。本来，需要借款的工商企业，很早已有减低利率的呼吁，公营银行而且有及时压低利率的任务，现在连私营行庄也觉得非降低利率不可，客观形势就完全成熟了。目下的贷款利率，一般的已经跌到仅为最高时期的十分之一以至十五分之一；当然比起最高时期的黑市利息，跌落程度还远不止此。
    于是问题来了。倘使过去的贷款利率是六七十分，存款是二三十分，行庄除了准备金的提存之外，还可能赚到二三十分的毛利。现在贷款利率减到三分，高一点的地区也不过五分，存款利率减到几厘到二三分，那就只可能赚到二三分的毛利了。同时，存款并没有大量的增加，放款依然不容易放出去，而开支却没有多大的减少，日子当然是更不好过了。照趋势来看，利率还是要降低的，今年内贷款利率降到月息二分以内是完全可能的。那时存放之间的毛利，可能不到一分。倘使没有十倍、二十倍的存款的增加，营业便会无法维持。存款要有这样大量的增加，显然只能限于少数基础巩固，组织健全，再加上实行劳资协商经营现代化的行庄，那就还得经过一个相当剧烈的淘汰过程。“必须从数量的减少以求质量的提高，从力量的集中达到营业的正常”。这是我去年写的两句话，今天依然是适用的。
    以上海为例，目下公私合营和私营行庄的存款，一共只有五千多亿，以物价指数折合战前银元，只值二千五百万左右。但在战前，上海商业储蓄银行一家，在上海的存款，就达一亿元以上。那就是说：目下上海全体公私合营和私营行庄的存款，只及战前一家银行当地存款的四分之一。以战前一家银行四分之一的存款，今天要维持七十多家行庄的生存，其不合理甚至终于是不可能，真是再明白不过的了。
    更严重的是，目前五千多亿的存款，半数以上集中在四家公私合营的银行，其余七十家以上的私营行庄所占的还不足半数。在私营行庄当中，占家数百分之四十的行庄的存款总数，只占全部存款数的百分之四，每家的存款都在五亿元以下，那又如何过得了？当然，同样的甚至更严重的情形还在别处存在着。比方，在北京，就有存款只有五千万元的钱庄。
    在资本主义无政府的生产之下，银行和一般企业的大批倒闭本来是要按周期发生的。美国一九二九年以后的情况，就是一个很典型的例子。半殖民地的旧中国，在通货膨胀时期的经济发展，更集中的、更显著的表现出来无政府的状态；而这一表现的焦点，便是金融事业。量的无条件的扩大再带来了质的无限止的降低。这一时期若干新设行庄组织之畸形与作风之丑恶，金融界正派人士也为之摇头叹息。这种不合理的状态如能任其继续存在，那才真是怪事！经过时势潮流的淘汰，让进步的、结实的保留下来，让落后的、脆弱的消灭下去，那才是人民的愿望，也是新国家应有的气象。
    一切归咎他人的说法，都是没有什么理由的。说公营银行不应该竞争吗？新民主主义的公营银行决不能让有关国家经济命脉的金融市场操纵在私人资本的手里，它不能脱离群众去走资本主义的“银行之银行”的道路。它必须通过直接服务人民以达到完全领导金融市场的目的。中国人民银行的存款利率，而且一般的都低于私营行庄，谈不到什么竞争。它所吸收的私人存款为数也很小，即使全部交给私营行庄，也决不能维持全部行庄的生存。
    说国家的管理不应该太严密吗？事实已经证明，这正是防止投机所必需，而防止投机正是为着行庄的利益，更是为着广大存款人的利益。倘使没有比较严密的管理，那些不循正轨的私营行庄所闯的祸水和存款人所受的损害，将更不知伊于胡底。
    说是由于捐税和公债的负担过重吗？显然的，即使完全豁免了捐税和公债的负担，那些基础薄弱的行庄，也无法存在。一般说来，倒闭的私营行庄而且都正不是负担捐税和公债很多的行庄。
    说是由于公私合营银行的竞争吗？它们并不具备任何的特权，而只是多了一些国家的管理。人民信任国家，信任这多了一些的国家的管理，因而把存款送上去，那是没有理由拒绝，也决不能算是不合理的竞争的。
    说是由于劳方要求过高，开支过大吗？劳方固然应该自我检讨，而资方也是可以依法和劳方来协商解决的。国家的政策是“劳资两利”，决不愿见资方损害劳方，或劳方损害资方的利益。但除了协商、调解、仲裁，以至法院判决之外，也绝不能干涉资方或劳方在法律范围以内的行动。实际上，即使工资减至最低限度，人员裁至最少限度，私营行庄也决无法全部保留。
    “公私兼顾”的政策是确定的，然而，有一个前提是不可少的：私营企业必须有利于国计民生，为人民所需要才可能得到国家的照顾。那些不符合于共同纲领的要求的私营企业，当然是不可能得到共同纲领的保障的。此外，还有一个基本的条件：私营企业在组织和设备上，必须适合于时代和环境的要求。“公私兼顾”只是一种政策，可以帮助那些适于生存的私人企业的发展；但，它决计不是一颗万应万灵的仙丹，能够包医五痨七伤等等不治之症。生产条件不适合的企业，公营的也要加以淘汰，不独私营为然。那是“爱莫能助”的，是无法照顾得了的。
    经济情况显然已经好转，但从工商金融事业的各个部门和各个单位来说，任何好转都不会是全面的——不合人民需要、不够条件的还是要淘汰。私营行庄必须紧紧的把握住这好转的时机，可以转业的就应该毅然决然的转业，真正无法可想的还只好停闭，观望是无益的。在好转的时候，转业固然是比较的容易，停闭也可能减少一些困难。必须相信一点，今后任何的经济繁荣都不可能容纳现有的全部私营行庄。可以容纳那么多行庄的那种虚伪的繁荣今后是再也不会出现了。
    问题于是来了：应该如何转业？这是一个不容易回答的问题，更不可能在这一篇短文里面答复。政府的指导虽然已经有计划有步骤地展开，但，任何指导也不大可能弥补各个企业主观条件的缺陷。比方说：垦荒的工作可以容纳大量的资本和人力；但，这就显然不适宜于银行钱庄的转业。不少需要高级技术的工业都可以发展；但那些工业连国家都还不具备办理的条件，何况私人？今天所能说的只有两点：第一，消极的，千万不能再向商业转，也不能再向技术条件太低，办理太容易的工业转，那是一般的都已经过剩的。第二，积极的，“面向农村”、“面向人民”两句原则性的话依然是对的，但必须更深入、更提高一些。比如，在无锡周围，动力灌溉农田的设备都已经过剩了，但到远一些的内地，这依然是切需的。技术更高一些的农业服务，当然在许多地方都需要。
    联营、合并、以及共同组织投资公司，都是可以鼓励的。内部组织的调整和经营方式的改变，也是完全必需的。公私合营从金融业来说，是一条比较窄狭的路。因为，显然的，把私营的过剩改变为公私合营的过剩，并不能解决过剩的问题，而公私合营也是必须具备一定的条件的。
    今天的事情主要的还是依靠群众。私营行庄的事情，私营行庄的负责人比我们更熟悉，他们应该集体的来讨论共同的前途。行庄的从业人员必然关切自己的前途，这一个讨论就可以更扩大的发展到全体从业人员。行庄在社会上的接触面是很广大的，他们还可以进一步和大众商量。集思广益的结果，种种的创造是会生产出来的。
     一九五○、六、六、于北京。
