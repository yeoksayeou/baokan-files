　　Model Cadre Li Jike
　　Comrade Li Jike (Communist Party Member), the director of the Second District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Tang County, Hebei Province, comes from a peasant background and started working in February 1946. In September of last year, the county supply and marketing cooperative transferred him to work in the Second District Supply and Marketing Cooperative. When he was transferred, Director Li of the county supply and marketing cooperative told him: "The Second District has been a disaster area in Tang County for many years. You have to put in more effort to help the masses improve their production."
　　After Comrade Li Jike arrived in the Second District, he first convened a meeting of the supply and marketing cooperative's cadres, established learning and work systems, made clear divisions of labor, and personally went to the countryside to understand the actual situation and determine the work steps. From January to the present, thanks to Comrade Li Jike's efforts, supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in twenty-two villages, supplying farmers with oil, salt, matches, and other items. In terms of leading the masses in sideline production, a total of 23,000 jin of medicinal herbs have been dug up, which can be exchanged for 30,000 jin of rice. The Ding County branch of the Native Produce Company has also signed a contract with the cooperative to purchase 18,000 jin of medicinal herbs. To facilitate farmers' sale of medicinal herbs, Comrade Li Jike also led the organization of three purchasing stalls. Originally, the farmers in this district did not have the habit of growing yams. Comrade Li Jike publicized to the farmers that planting one mu of yams could yield the equivalent of two mu of grain, and the district supply and marketing cooperative used the method of lending seedlings to mobilize farmers to plant yams, so that the farmers in the district accepted the demand for planting yams. Comrades from the district supply and marketing cooperative also personally went to Xin Zhuang, Mang Lan and other six villages to provide technical guidance. The district originally had no habit of growing cotton, but thanks to the mobilization and guidance of the district supply and marketing cooperative, a total of 1,151 mu of cotton were planted this year. In order to complete this year's agricultural production increase task, the cooperative is also actively promoting the work of improved varieties.
　　In mid-May, when the Second District was selecting model cadres for leading production, Comrade Li Jike was selected as a model cadre. The county party committee issued a notice of commendation for this.

　　模范干部李计科
    河北省唐县二区供销合作社主任李计科同志（中共党员），农民出身，于一九四六年二月参加工作。去年九月县供销社调他到二区供销社工作。在调工作时，县供销社李主任告诉他说：“二区是唐县历年来的灾区，你得多卖些力气，才能帮助群众把生产搞好。”
    李计科同志到二区后，首先召开了供销社干部会议，建立了学习及工作制度，进行了明确的分工，并亲自下乡，了解实际情况，确定工作步骤。从一月起至现在，由于李计科同志的努力，在二十二个村成立了供销社，供给农民油、盐、洋火等物品。在领导群众进行副业生产方面，共刨药材二万三千斤，可换米三万斤。土产公司定县分公司并与该社订立了收购药材一万八千斤的合同。为便利农民的出售药材，李计科同志又领导组织了三个收购摊。本来该区农民没有种山药的习惯，李计科同志向农民宣传种一亩山药可顶二亩谷的收成，又由区供销社以贷秧办法发动农民栽种，使该区农民接受了种山药的要求。区供销社同志并亲自到新庄、蟒栏等六个村作技术指导。该区原无种棉习惯，也由于区供销社的发动和指导，在今年共栽种了一千一百五十一亩棉花。为完成今年农业的增产任务，该社并积极进行推广优良品种的工作。
    五月中旬，二区评选领导生产的模范干部时，李计科同志即被选为模范干部。县委为此特通报表扬。
