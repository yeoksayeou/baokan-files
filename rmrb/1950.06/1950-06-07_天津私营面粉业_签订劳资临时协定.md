Tianjin Private Flour Industry
 Signs Temporary Labor-Management Agreement

[Tianjin News] Tianjin Daily News: The Tianjin Private Flour Industry's Temporary Labor-Management Agreement has been approved by the Tianjin Labor Bureau. Twenty-four companies, including Shoufeng, Fuxing, and Yitai, participated in the agreement. The agreement, based on the principle of mutual benefit for labor and management, resolves issues such as converting temporary workers to permanent workers, labor protection and welfare, work stoppages, and factory management. In the past, there were some unreasonable phenomena in the industry's conversion of temporary workers to permanent workers and in the wage system. For example, Shoufeng Factories No. 1 and No. 2 had a total of 273 employees, with temporary workers accounting for nearly half. Some temporary workers had worked for two or three years, or even more than ten years. Many temporary workers possessed excellent skills, but they had not yet been converted to permanent workers, which seriously affected their enthusiasm for production. This agreement appropriately stipulates the conditions for converting temporary workers to permanent workers based on skills and labor intensity. It is estimated that more than 90 temporary workers in Shoufeng and four other factories can be converted to permanent workers. Regarding labor protection and welfare issues, the agreement stipulates the temporary cancellation of profit sharing, double pay, and holiday bonuses. This is the result of the efforts of the factory's employees to restrain themselves and voluntarily assist the capitalists in overcoming temporary difficulties. Regarding work stoppage issues, the agreement stipulates different methods for paying wages during three different work stoppage periods, which can ensure the minimum living expenses of employees are maintained within a certain period, and also take care of the factory's special difficulties as much as possible. Regarding factory management issues, the agreement specifically stipulates labor discipline, administrative management, and reward and punishment methods, laying a good foundation for the gradual implementation of democratic management in the industry.

Currently, each factory is making concrete plans based on the spirit of the agreement. Labor and management of Yitai and Fuxing factories have already begun to reform some of the unreasonable systems existing in their respective factories. Yitai workers have lower wages, but profit sharing is too high. This time, the factory's labor-management agreement cancelled the profit-sharing system and appropriately adjusted wages. The factory can still save the cost of 100 bags of flour per month. Fuxing Factory's labor force allocation was improper. Now, the workers have taken the initiative to implement a three-shift fixed staffing system, reallocate labor, and promote three workers to serve as foremen. The factory can save more than 17 million yuan per month.

Since liberation, with the strong support of state-owned enterprises, the larger factories have all been profitable by February of this year. Since March, products have been temporarily slow-selling, but each factory has been able to continue production. The signing of this temporary labor-management agreement by the industry can normalize labor-management relations and pave the way for the development of the industry.

　　天津私营面粉业
    签订劳资临时协定
    【天津讯】天津日报消息：天津私营面粉业劳资临时协定，业经天津市劳动局批准。参加协定者，计有寿丰、福星、益泰等二十四家。该协定本劳资两利精神，解决了临时工改长工、劳保福利、停工及工厂管理等问题。过去，该业临时工改长工的问题，及工资制度中，均存在着若干不合理的现象。如寿丰一、二两厂，共有职工二百七十三人。其中临时工几达半数。临时工的工龄有两三年、甚至十余年者，许多临时工技术极为优良，但至今仍未能改为长工，严重地影响生产情绪。此次协定根据技术、劳动强度等，适当地规定了临时工改长工的条件。估计寿丰等四厂约有九十多名临时工可改为长工。关于劳保福利问题，协定中规定暂时取消分红、双薪及节赏，这是各厂职工努力克己，自愿协助资方克服暂时困难的结果。关于停工问题，该协定规定了三种不同的停工期内发放工资办法，既可保证在一定期间内维持职工的最低生活费用，也尽可能地照顾了厂方的特殊困难。关于工厂管理问题，协定中具体规定了劳动纪律、行政管理及奖惩办法，为该业逐步实行民主管理奠定良好的基础。
    现在各厂正根据协定精神，做具体计划。益泰、福星两厂劳资双方，已开始着手改革各该工厂中存在的某些不合理的制度。益泰工人工资较低，但分红则过高，此次该厂劳资协议取消分红制，适当调整工资。厂方每月仍可节省支出折面粉百袋。福星厂劳动力配备不当，现工人主动提出实行三班定员制，从新配备劳力，并提升三个工人担任领班，厂方每月可节省一千七百余万元。
    解放以来，该业在国营企业大力扶助下，较具规模的厂户，至今年二月均有盈利。三月以来，产品暂时滞销，但各厂尚能继续维持生产。该业此次签订劳资临时协定，劳资关系可臻正常，为该业的发展开辟了道路。
