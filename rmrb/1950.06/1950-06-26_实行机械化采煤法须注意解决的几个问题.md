Several Problems to be Solved in Implementing Mechanized Coal Mining

Xu Tiemin, Director of Hegang Coal Mining Bureau

After the implementation of mechanized coal mining methods in the Hegang Coal Mine, the following problems still need to be solved:

I. Mechanical coordination. After the development of mechanized coal mining, the work progress was affected due to improper mechanical coordination. For example, the coal cutting machine operator is not skilled, the electric roller is prone to heat up, the parts are broken and cannot be replaced, the electric chute is insufficient, the winch has insufficient horsepower to pull, the air compressor leaks a lot, the pressure is small, and so on. These problems must be solved in three aspects: (1) The overall machinery must be re-adjusted, and the main pit mouth must be equipped with a 300-horsepower winch, and a spare winch should be equipped as much as possible. (2) Improve operation technology, train coal cutting machine operators, and equip dedicated repair personnel. To this end, the Hegang Coal Mining Bureau began on June 5th to transfer 25 young and strong coal mining workers to concentrate on running a coal cutting machine operator training class, specializing in coal cutting machine operation and simple repair technology. At the same time, it was decided that each mechanized coal mining face should be equipped with at least two more skilled mechanical and electrical workers, specializing in solving inspection and repair work. (3) Prepare sufficient spare parts and manufacture a batch of easily damaged parts for coal cutting machines and electric chutes for timely supply, to avoid affecting the work due to failure to repair in time.

II. Consolidation and continued training. At present, the mechanized coal mining work in Hegang has shifted from pilot to full-scale deployment, but not all of the twelve designated faces have been successful; those that have been successful are not solid enough. Therefore, consolidation and continued training are very important and arduous tasks at present. In addition to equipping strong cadres to strengthen leadership in each mine, the bureau plans to form a working group in early July, and the main cadres will go deep into the pits to lead this work.

III. Implement the graph management method. We should further implement the production graph management method taught to us by Soviet experts and strictly carry out professional division of labor. Because the graph system itself is a concrete guide to scientific division of labor. Some of our faces have not yet implemented the graph system to the workers, and many workers still do not understand it. We must patiently educate and launch a upsurge in learning the graph system.

IV. Main roadway transportation. The result of mechanized coal mining will sharply increase the output of a single face. The increase in the output of a single face is also related to the problem of main roadway transportation. At present, except for a very few main roadways, the general main roadways are completely single-line equipment and are made crooked, which affects the installation of card machines. Relying solely on manpower and single-line transportation will result in the phenomenon that coal cannot be transported out. Therefore, in order to adapt to the new coal mining methods, it is necessary to excavate roadways with sufficient cross-sectional area and straightness. In addition, in addition to using upper and lower layers and a few card machines for transportation, it is planned to select an appropriate pit mouth to test the installation of a belt conveyor device, in preparation for gradually entering a higher stage of mechanized coal mining.

V. Working face preparation. Generally speaking, our working face preparation work is not sufficient, as can be proved by the current situation. A face is bound to reduce its output before it ends and before it starts, so the output cannot be kept constantly balanced. This phenomenon is even more obvious, especially when arranging work through mechanized coal mining. Therefore, the preparation work of the coal mining working face must be done in advance. After a period of preparation, it will not affect the formal coal mining work. When a face ends or an accident occurs, and it is moved to another face, it can start producing coal immediately, so as not to cause an imbalance in production with sudden ups and downs.

VI. Wage issues. It is difficult to improve the work enthusiasm of workers if they do not understand how much they are being paid. For example, after the workers of the first, second, and third faces of Dongshan began to prepare for the mechanized coal mining face work, they did not clarify how the wages were calculated, and the leaders did not solve it in time. The workers saw that the output could not be increased during the preparation period, and believed that the wages would definitely be less. The lower the mood, the lower the mood, and finally a phenomenon was formed that they did not care whether the face was maintained or not, they would dig as long as there was coal, and they would leave after digging. Therefore, the leaders must promptly explain the wage issues to the workers, so that the workers can dispel their concerns about wages. During the preparation period, a certain amount of subsidy wages can be given when necessary, otherwise the workers will lose confidence in mechanized coal mining.

VII. Support technical personnel's correct improvement opinions and the combination of technology and labor. For example, the Dongshan Mining Bureau working group rarely consulted with workers when things happened, and did not teach the production graph management method to the workers, so they could not mobilize the workers to work according to the plan. Some administrative cadres also failed to fully support and adopt the correct improvement opinions of the technical personnel. For example, problems such as paving double tracks in the yard, sorting out ventilation roadways, filling gangue, and picking the top at the rear were not solved until the end of May, resulting in the collapse of the face and the need to re-equip personnel and organize forces. These are all experiences and lessons worthy of great attention.

VIII. Cultivate new-type heroes and struggle to implement mechanized coal mining. To struggle for the implementation of mechanized coal mining is the eternal and unchanging direction in the coal mining industry in the future. At the same time, in order to implement the mechanized coal mining movement, we must plan and step-by-step cultivate and encourage our heroes and models to quickly master technology and become new-type figures.

　　实行机械化采煤法须注意解决的几个问题
    鹤岗煤矿局局长  许铁民
    鹤岗煤矿实行机械化采煤方法后，还存有下面几个需要解决的问题：
    一、机械配合问题。机械化采煤开展以后，迎头便遇着因为机械配合不当，影响工作进展的问题。如截煤机手不熟练，电滚好发热，零件坏了配不上，电溜子不足，马机马力小拉不过来，压风机漏风多，压力小等等一连串的问题。这些问题必须从三方面来解决：（１）全局机械必须重新调剂，主力坑口一律配上三○○匹马力绞车，并尽可能的配备预备绞车。（２）提高运转技术，培养截煤机手，配备专人修理。为此，鹤岗煤矿局由六月五日开始抽调了年青体壮的采煤工友二十五名，集中开办截煤机手训练班，专门进行截煤机运转及简单修理技术。同时决定每个机械化采煤掌子，起码配备两名较熟练的机电工，专门解决检查修补工作。（３）准备充足的备品，制造一批截煤机及电溜子易于损坏的部分品，以便及时供应，避免因不能及时修理，影响工作的现象。
    二、巩固与继续培养问题。目前鹤岗机械化采煤工作已由试点转向全面展开，但决定了的十二个掌子并未全部成功；成功了的亦不够十分巩固，因之巩固与继续培养是目前十分重要而较为艰巨的工作。各矿除应配备有力干部加强领导外，局方准备在七月初组成工作组，各主要干部均分头深入坑井领导这一工作。
    三、贯彻图表管理方法。应进一步贯彻苏联专家教导给我们的生产图表管理方法，严格进行专业化分工。因为图表制本身就是一个科学分工的具体指导。我们有些掌子还没有把图表制贯彻到工人中去，许多工人还不懂得。必须耐心的教育，展开一个学习图表制的热潮。
    四、大巷运搬问题。机械化采煤的结果，则将急激增加一个掌子的产量。增加一个掌子产量的结果，又联系到大巷运搬问题。目前除极少数大巷以外，一般大巷完全是单线设备，且做得弯曲不直，因之影响了卡机的按设，单凭人力及单线运搬便会发生有煤运不出的现象。因此，必须适应新式采煤方法，开凿足够使用的断面积与直度的巷道。另外，目前除利用上下层及少数卡机运搬外，拟选择一适当坑口试设皮带运搬装置，以备逐步走入机械化采煤更高的阶段。
    五、工作面准备问题。一般说来，我们工作面准备工作做得是十分不够的，根据目前情况可以证明。一个掌子临终及临开始前，必定要降低产量，因而产量不能保持经常平衡，特别是通过机械化采煤布置工作，这一现象就更加明显。因此，采煤工作面的准备工作必需提前，经过一段准备过程，就不致影响正式采煤工作。在一个掌子结束或发生事故，迁到另一个掌子时，马上能开始出煤，才不致发生产量忽高忽低的不平衡现象。
    六、工资问题。工人对工资多少不摸底，工作情绪便很难提高。譬如东山一二三掌子的工人，开始准备机械化采煤掌子工作后，未弄清工资怎样计算，领导干部也没有予以及时的解决，工人一看准备期间产量提不起来，认为工资一定会少，越弄情绪越低，最后便形成了不顾掌子面维持不维持，有煤就挖，挖完就走的现象。因此领导干部必须及时的把工资问题对工人讲清楚，使工人在工资上去除顾虑。在准备期间，必要时可给与一定的补助工资，否则会使工人对机械化采煤失掉信心。
    七、支持技术人员正确改进意见及技术与劳动结合问题。如东山矿务处工作小组，遇事很少和工人商量，没把生产图表管理方法教给工人，因之不能动员起工人按照计划进行工作。某些行政干部又不能充分支持与采纳技术人员的正确改进意见，如车场子铺双道，整理通风坑道，充填矸石，后面挑顶等问题，一直到五月末仍未解决，以致掌子搞垮，不得不从新配备人员，组织力量，这都是值得很好注意的经验教训。
    八、培养新型英雄与为贯彻机械化采煤而斗争。为贯彻机械化采煤而斗争，是今后采煤事业上永恒不变的方向。同时，为贯彻机械化采煤运动，我们必须有计划、有步骤地培养鼓励我们的英雄、模范们，迅速掌握技术，成为新型的人物。
