　　The Third Reading Room
    Mobilizes Educated Youths to Go Deep Among the Masses to Explain Books
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Third Reading Room on Xisi Dingzi Street in this city recently added a large number of comic books and popular literary pamphlets with political and educational significance, which are displayed in the reading room for the masses to read. The room organized a group of young intellectuals to carry such books to the areas where poor peddlers and housewives who cannot come to the room to read live, and explain them during their spare time every evening. This work has had a very good effect on enlightening the political consciousness of the masses. For example, after reading the comic book on land reform, Fu Jiande said: "Good heavens! The landlords are so vicious! It turns out that the peasants were exploited and impoverished by this group of people." Some illiterate women, after listening to the explanation of the book stories about women's liberation, said: "The Communist Party really helped us to liberate ourselves! It turns out that women are not born to be inferior to men. I have to produce well and not let our women down." The masses welcomed the young people who went to serve them. Someone said: "In the past, a poor boy was destined to be poor for the rest of his life after he was born. What's the use of studying without money! Now the times have changed. Books are delivered to our door, and some people patiently teach us!" At present, at least 350 people come to the room to read every day, and the maximum has reached 630 people.

　　第三书报阅览室
    动员知识青年  深入群众讲书
    【本报讯】本市西四丁字街第三书报阅览室最近添购了大批富有政治教育意义的连环图画及通俗的文艺小册子，陈列室内，供群众阅览。该室组织了一部分青年知识分子，于每晚间空暇时，携带此类图书，到不能来室阅览的贫苦小贩及家庭妇女居住地区给他们讲解。这一工作，对启发群众的政治觉悟，收到了很好的效果。如傅建德看了土地改革的连环图画后说：“好家伙！地主这么狠毒！原来农民是被这群东西剥削穷的。”有些不识字的妇女听了讲解关于妇女翻身的图书故事后，都说：“共产党真是帮助咱们翻了身！原来女人并不是天生来比男人低的，我得好好生产，别给咱们妇女泄气。”群众对于去为他们服务的青年们，都表示欢迎。有人说：“以前穷小子生下后，就注定了穷一辈子，没有钱使什么念书啊！现在这年头儿可就是变了，把书送上门来，还有人耐着性儿教咱们！”目前至该室阅览的，每日至少有三百五十人，最多曾达六百三十人。
