A Letter from Soviet Women to Chinese Women

Dear heroic sisters of free China:

We, the female workers of the North Donets Railway and female social workers, extend our heartfelt congratulations to you.

We rejoice with you in the victory of the Chinese people and are convinced that the solidarity of the Chinese and Soviet people has been further strengthened by the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

The victory of the Soviet people in the war against fascist Germany and Japanese imperialism inspired the national liberation movements in Eastern countries.

The victory of you, the Chinese people, and the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, has also inspired the people of all colonial and dependent countries, strengthening their will to fight for national independence, peace, and democracy.

Your struggle for freedom and independence is closely related to us, the Soviet people, and is deeply understood by us. We Soviet women, as well as our fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers, resolutely defended the sacred Kremlin of Stalingrad and Moscow in the anti-fascist war to defend the freedom and independence of our motherland. They not only defended the freedom of the motherland, but also liberated the people of Eastern Europe from the fascist yoke. Soviet women learned to manufacture weapons in the rear. During the siege of Leningrad, we showed miracles of fortitude and heroism. We once fought side by side with our husbands and sons on the front lines and in the guerrillas, holding weapons.

After the war, we learned to rebuild our huge factories and mines at an unbelievable speed on the destroyed ruins. We learned to build beautiful cities and villages. Fragrant orchards and trees appeared on the land imprinted with the scars of war.

The rapid recovery of our industry and agriculture has enabled the Communist Party and the Soviet government to implement the third post-war price reduction. From March 1, 1950, food and consumer goods prices were reduced by 20 to 30 percent. This is another step forward on the road to rapidly increasing the happiness of our people and one of the most recent victories of the Soviet socialist system.

We, the women of the North Donets Railway, actively participate in the work of defending and building the welfare of our beloved motherland and the happiness of our children. The mothers, wives, and sisters of the workers of the socialist North Donets coalfield trunk railway assisted the workers in their work. In the wind and snow, women organized themselves to deliver hot meals to the workers. We organized ourselves to collect gifts for children who lost their relatives in the Great Patriotic War. We women participated in special groups to study the biographies of Lenin and Stalin.

Dear friends! When sending our first letter, we hope to receive your reply and hope to begin regular correspondence with you to strengthen the friendship and ties between the women of the Soviet Union and free China. We hope you will have greater achievements in your efforts to build for the happiness of the Chinese people and all freedom-loving people in the world.

Long live the eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the All-China Democratic Women's Federation!

Long live the Soviet Union—the vanguard of the world's working people in the struggle for lasting peace, freedom, and socialism!

Long live our beloved leader, mentor, and friend—the great Stalin!

Representatives of the women of the North Donets:

专栏：

　　苏联妇女给中国妇女的信亲爱的英勇的自由中国的姊妹们：
    我们——北顿纳兹铁路女工及妇女社会工作者们，向你们致衷心的祝贺。
    我们与你们一同为中国人民的胜利而欢欣，并确信中苏人民的团结因中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订而更加巩固了。
    苏联人民对法西斯德国与日本帝国主义作战的胜利鼓舞了东方各国的民族解放运动。
    你们中国人民和英勇的中国人民解放军的胜利，又鼓舞了所有殖民地与附属国家的人民，增强了他们为争取民族独立、和平民主而斗争的意志。
    你们争取自由和独立的斗争是和我们苏联人民有着密切关系，并为我们所深刻了解的。我们苏联妇女以及我们的父亲、丈夫、儿子和兄弟们，在保卫祖国自由、独立的反法西斯战争中，坚决地守卫了斯大林格勒和莫斯科神圣的克林姆宫。他们不但保卫了祖国的自由，而且从法西斯桎梏下解放了东欧人民。苏联妇女在后方学习了制造武器，在列宁格勒的封锁中，我们表现了刚毅和英勇的奇迹。我们曾经和我们的丈夫、儿子们拿着武器在前线和在游击队里并肩作战。
    战后，我们学会在毁坏了的废墟上，以令人不能相信的速度重建起我们巨大的工厂和矿业。我们学会了建设美丽的城市和乡村。在印满了战争烙印的土地上，出现了芬芳的果园和树木。
    我们工业、农业的迅速恢复，使共产党和苏维埃政府实行了战后第三次降低物价。从一九五○年三月一日起，食物与消费品价格减低了百分之二十到三十。这是在迅速增进我们人民幸福的道路上的又一步的前进，这是苏维埃社会主义制度最近的胜利之一。
    我们，北顿纳兹铁路的妇女们，积极地参加了保卫和建设我们所热爱的祖国的福利和孩子们幸福的工作。社会主义北顿纳兹煤区干线铁路工人的母亲们、妻子们和姊妹们，协助了工人们的工作。在狂风大雪下，妇女们组织起来，搬送热食给工人们。我们组织起来，收集礼物送给在伟大爱国战争中失去亲属的儿童们。我们妇女参加特别小组，学习列宁和斯大林的传记。
    亲爱的朋友们！在寄上我们第一封信时，我们希望能收到你们的回信，并希望与你们开始经常地通信，借以加强苏联和自由中国妇女的友谊与联系。希望你们在为中国人民和全世界爱好自由的人民的幸福而努力建设的工作中，有更伟大的成就。
    中苏友谊永远存在！
    毛泽东同志领导下的中华人民共和国中央人民政府万岁！
    中华全国民主妇联万岁！
    苏联——全世界劳动人民争取持久和平、自由与社会主义的先锋万岁！
    我们热爱的领袖、导师与朋友——伟大的斯大林万岁！
    北顿纳兹妇女代表：
