　　Xinhua News Agency, June 16th Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch from Cape Town: The South African House of Assembly has passed the apartheid bill. The bill stipulates that non-whites will be expelled from certain areas within the Federation and from areas originally designated for non-white residence. The bill is still awaiting passage by the Senate.

　　This reactionary bill has aroused fierce opposition from people of all races in South Africa. According to Reuters: The African National Congress, the main organization representing Africans in the South African Federation, called on all residents on June 11th to stop work on June 26th to express their protest. The South African Communist Party, the Indian Congress, and the African People's Association, the largest organization of mixed-race people in South Africa, also issued statements guaranteeing their support for this measure and calling on white residents to do the same.

    各族人民激烈反对
    【新华社十六日讯】据电通社驻开普敦记者报道：南非联邦众院已通过种族隔离法案。该法案规定：将非白种人自该联邦境内若干地区及原划定非白种人居住区内逐出。该法案尚待参院通过。
    这一反动法案已引起南非各族人民的激烈反对。据路透社讯：南非联邦内代表非洲人的主要团体——非洲国民大会，于十一日号召所有居民于六月二十六日停止工作，表示抗议。南非共产党、印度人大会和南非混血种最大的团体非洲人民协会也发表声明，保证支持这一措置，并号召白种居民同样予以支持。
