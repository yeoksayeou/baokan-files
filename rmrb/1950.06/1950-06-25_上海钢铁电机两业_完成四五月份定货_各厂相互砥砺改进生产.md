Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th. Public and private factories in Shanghai's steel and electrical industries have successively completed their order tasks for April and May. The output of various factories affiliated with the joint public-private Shanghai Steel Company and various private factories was higher in May than in April. Among them, the output of the private Maoxing Factory increased by 77.5% in May compared to April. The private Yuanshun Factory improved its equipment, reducing the baking time per furnace by half, thereby doubling the baking volume. To ensure that small private factories can accept orders and maintain production, the Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee mobilized large public and private steel mills to open billets for small steel mills. In addition, it helped organize large and small motor factories to conduct technical cooperation, which solved the difficulty for most private motor factories that could not independently manufacture large motors.

The order prices are the same for public and private factories. The principle for determining prices is not to waste state funds, while ensuring that factories accepting orders can obtain certain profits. Because the prices for public and private factories to accept orders are the same, factories encourage each other to improve production. For example, the cost of steel rolling at Shanghai Steel Company decreased from 300 parity units per ton in April to 215 units. Accepting orders at 255 units still yields a profit. This encourages the enthusiasm of private manufacturers to improve production and their confidence in accepting orders at the same price.

In the early stage of ordering, some factories had quality standards not being met because the inspection system was not established in time, resulting in unnecessary losses in production. Since the establishment of the inspection team, this phenomenon has been corrected. The Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee is now preparing to establish a technical team to help factories improve quality, achieve low prices and high quality, and strive to obtain more tasks in the next national ordering.

　　上海钢铁电机两业
    完成四五月份定货
    各厂相互砥砺改进生产
    【新华社上海十三日电】上海钢铁、电机两业公私营工厂，已先后完成四、五月份定货任务。公私合营的上海钢铁公司所属各厂，以及各私营工厂五月份的产量都较四月份为高，其中私营茂兴厂五月份产量较四月份提高百分之七十七点五。私营源顺工厂因改进了设备，每炉烘钢时间较前减少一半，使烘钢量提高一倍。为照顾小型私营工厂能接受定货，维持生产，华东军政委员会工业部曾动员公私营大型钢铁厂为小型钢铁厂开坯。另外又帮助大小电机厂组织起来，进行技术合作，解决了大多数私营电机工厂不能单独制造大型马达的困难。
    定货价格公私工厂均相同。确定价格的原则是不浪费国家资金，同时使接受定货工厂能得到一定利润。因为公私工厂接受定货的价格相同，各厂在改进生产上相互砥砺。如上海钢铁公司轧钢成本四月份每吨由三百个折实单位降到二百十五个单位，以二百五十五个单位接受定货，仍有利可图；这就鼓励了私营厂家改善生产的积极性和以相同价格接受定货的信心。
    在定货初期，因检验制度没有及时建立，若干工厂曾发生质量不合标准的现象，造成生产中不应有的损失。自检查小组成立后，这种现象已得到纠正。现华东军政委员会工业部正准备成立技术小组，帮助各工厂改进质量，达到价廉物美，争取在下次全国定货中得到更多的任务。
