The National News Work Conference in April will occupy an important page in the history of the news industry in New China, because this conference resolved the main issues in the work of newspapers, radio stations, and news agencies; especially, it pointed out a clear direction for improving newspaper work. After the conference, newspapers across the country launched a surge of improvement work based on the "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work" issued by the General Administration of Press. Looking at the newspapers of May and the May work reports of newspapers nationwide to the General Administration of Press, our newspapers have generally made some progress, and some have made relatively significant progress. This is just the beginning of the national newspaper improvement work. Based on these advancements, and following the established path to move forward, our newspapers will present a brand-new look.

Here, we first extract relevant parts of the work reports from various newspapers regarding the reorganization of the editorial department's organizational form and working methods to strengthen connection with reality. This will explain the situations, experiences, and problems in improving work in this aspect.

Judging from the reports, the vast majority of newspapers in various regions have already changed the old organizational form and working methods of the editorial department, and have begun to implement appropriate division of labor according to different aspects of social life. The result of implementing this reorganization has proven to be good. The connection between newspapers and reality has been strengthened, and the content of reports has also become richer.

The Hebei Daily stated in its report: "After the unification of editing, communication, and interviewing, the long-term inconsistencies and mutual blaming of the past among the three were eliminated. More importantly, it strengthened the work of actively organizing manuscripts, because editing work, through the editors' personal participation in manuscript organization, can begin to obtain the manuscripts they need; reporters can conduct purposeful interviews more appropriately according to the editorial plan; communication liaison workers have enriched the content of manuscript organization and rejection, greatly improving the writing enthusiasm of correspondents. Many correspondents wrote to say: 'As long as you come up with special topics, we will definitely guarantee completion.' Some editors explained to correspondents why their manuscripts were modified in this way. The correspondents wrote back gratefully, saying: 'This kind of help is too great.'"

The Beijing Xinmin Bao "began to divide the editing and interviewing staff into three groups from April: finance and economics, politics, and culture and education. Each group has three or two people, and each group has a group leader to discuss editing and interviewing work in a timely manner, led by the editor-in-chief and responsible to the editor-in-chief. After this division of labor, the interviewing activities and the quality of manuscripts have improved somewhat. Night shift editors have the opportunity to go out for interviews, and field reporters can also write more substantial and informative news and feature stories. …

"…The in-depth and improved reporting work has enabled reporters to move from superficial reporting to specific and profound reporting, and some have done more systematic reporting. For example, the adjustment of industry and commerce focused on private factories and shops overcoming difficulties through labor-capital consultations, and several typical examples were reported. …More systematically reported were the district representative conferences, from the preparation work of each district, the election of representatives, and the holding of meetings. The significance of the meeting was pointed out in the reports, the government's experience was initially summarized, the masses' reactions were reported, and the shortcomings in the work were criticized. There was also the improvement of the tram company, from losing money to making money, as well as the acceptance of reasonable suggestions and the creation of water-blocking boards that are not afraid of rain and other inventions. Doing so made the newspaper closer to the general public and played a considerable educational role." Both public and private newspapers have begun to make some progress in their work after implementing this change.

After the reorganization, the organization became more flexible, the manuscripts became more substantial, and the work of editing, interviewing, and communication liaison improved. This is the first benefit.

Second, on the basis of the foregoing, editorial work began to become more planned. The New Hunan Daily stated in its report:

"The editorial department has established unified and centralized leadership, and has implemented grouping according to different aspects of social life. …At present, the editor-in-chief's office has initially been able to formulate weekly reporting plans based on the plans of each group, according to the intentions of the editorial board. …

"Due to the strengthening of planning and the unification of leadership, news reports have become more concentrated than in the past. In general, each page can cooperate with each other, and the situation of each doing its own thing has been reduced somewhat. The newspaper can generally show a clearer focus every day. Various forms of manuscripts, such as daily comments, reports, and readers' letters, all revolve around one or two centers, enhancing the newspaper's guiding role in work."

The Songjiang Daily also said: "In May, we made some progress in striving for initiative and strengthening planning compared to the past, showing that we have begun to pay attention to organizing manuscripts in a planned way." However, the Songjiang Daily still has shortcomings in strengthening planning. They "actively organized many manuscripts in May, but it was still somewhat blind. The 55 actively organized manuscripts of the industrial group were not organized systematically in advance, but rather encountered sporadically by comrades doing specific work. …Because the organization of manuscripts was encountered sporadically, the specific topics of the manuscripts were not planned in advance."

Why do these shortcomings arise? The main reason seems to be the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the actual work and the lack of necessary close contact with the leading organs. Changing the organization and work of the editorial department is precisely for better division of labor and cooperation, and for establishing close contact with the leading organs of various departments. This is the third benefit of the reorganization. The Northeast Daily reported their experience in this regard as follows:

"Because the editors take time to regularly understand the situation in the relevant departments, and have a grasp of the materials and are familiar with the policies, they can naturally better handle the manuscripts of the correspondents, and they can also more purposefully and systematically discover news materials and discuss how to write with the correspondents in person. The manuscripts organized in this way can be used in most cases. This is a good start to changing the past practice of sitting at home, only knowing to urge correspondents for manuscripts, and rarely being able to provide specific opinions. This experience still needs to be summarized and improved as a basis for the future development and improvement of communication work."

The Hebei Daily also "resolutely overcame the bias of running the newspaper behind closed doors. The leading comrades of the editorial department and the editorial staff began to go out and strengthen close contact with various departments, and grasp the intentions of the leading organs and the actual work situation. In addition to participating in the regular and irregular meetings of various departments according to their own division of labor, they also frequently exchanged opinions over the phone and in person. In just half a month, they have initially experienced that strengthening contact with reality can maintain a clear mind in the editorial department and prevent blind leadership. However, some editorial staff are not good at organizing reports based on this after attending meetings."

The "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work" says, "Change the existing state of separate operations in editing, interviewing, communication, liaison, and other work that hinder contact with reality, establish unified and centralized leadership of the editorial department, and implement appropriate grouping according to different aspects of social life." This is a completely new subject for many newspapers. When starting to implement it, some difficulties will be encountered. The following problems have been seen in reports from various regions.

First, after implementing the new organizational form and working methods, there is an urgent need to strengthen the unified and centralized leadership of the editorial department. The Hebei Daily reported their experience, saying: "The leadership mainly grasps four links: First, firmly grasp the task of setting topics and writing articles, and organize manuscripts with emphasis and purpose, and resolutely prevent and overcome the tendency to weaken communication liaison work due to the integration of editing, interviewing, and communication. Second, regularly formulate a monthly editorial plan and a weekly publication plan so that the work of each group has something to follow and does not form its own stream. The general monthly plan should be formulated half a month in advance, so that reporters and communication liaison can organize reports; after the plan is formulated, it must also be supervised and checked and specifically helped to be realized. Third, strive for ample time. Except for manuscripts that are very time-sensitive, general manuscripts should be submitted two days in advance; particularly important manuscripts and editorials should not be included in the number of manuscripts published on the same day, and should be sent to the provincial party committee for review before publication. In this way, the editor-in-chief has ample time to review, consider, and make choices. Fourth, establish some necessary systems such as the daily meeting system of the editor-in-chief's office, the manuscript review and publication sample viewing system, the reporter correspondent manuscript handling system, the inquiry system for criticism manuscripts, and the meeting reporting system. In establishing the system, we must avoid complicated and overlapping procedures and pay attention to implementation. After grasping the above links, the leadership of the editorial department gradually got rid of bureaucratism, overcame the chaotic phenomenon, was able to maintain a clear mind, and strived for more ample time to participate in important meetings of the leading organs and to help the editorial staff improve in their work." In this way, the Hebei Daily "initially and gradually shifted from passive to active in the work of the editorial department."

In fact, the issue of strengthening unified and centralized leadership in the editorial department is mainly the issue of strengthening the planning of editorial work. With a plan, one can avoid the blind and chaotic state of leadership. After the Su'nan Daily implemented the new division of labor, the number of manuscripts greatly increased, which is a good phenomenon. However, due to insufficient prior estimation, the work was once passive. Now, they are solving this problem by strengthening planning. They said in their report:

"Now, each group in the editorial department is calling for more manuscripts, and the newspaper cannot publish them all and is always squeezed down, which affects the timeliness. More manuscripts are a good phenomenon. Originally, we were afraid that there would not be enough manuscripts after the revision, and we did not anticipate this situation in advance. Therefore, we did not come up with specific methods early, such as stipulating the quality of manuscripts and proposing the number of manuscripts that each group should publish every day to restrain each group, and to enable each group to purposefully organize and edit manuscripts and select and streamline manuscripts within this scope every day. We did not do this, and as a result, each group blindly produced, and the editor-in-chief's office was passive when unifying the pages every night, and it was too late to adapt and streamline them. Some manuscripts were squeezed for several days, and the newspaper failed to improve the quality of the manuscripts because there were more manuscripts.

"However, strictly speaking, our manuscripts are not many now, and they are still too few. Many areas and many tasks have not been reported, or have not been reported well. Therefore, in the future, on the one hand, we still have to find ways to increase the source of manuscripts. And we believe that as long as we are willing to find ways, the number of manuscripts will increase; and the increase in the number of manuscripts is the basis for us to improve the quality of the manuscripts. On the other hand, in our editorial work, we should also emphasize better editing and organizing of manuscripts. In addition to specifically stipulating the number of manuscripts published by each group every day (except in special circumstances) and urging them to improve the editing and organization of manuscripts, we should also focus on guiding editors and reporters on how to learn to judge the value of news and take care of the newspaper's space so that the news is shorter and shorter."

The experiences of the Su'nan Daily are worth referencing.

Another issue, the leadership of correspondents after the implementation of the new division of labor, has attracted more general attention from newspapers. The Changjiang Daily stated in its report when talking about their existing problems: "Third, difficulties have arisen in communication work. With the implementation of the integration of editing, interviewing, and communication, the leadership of correspondents cannot be centralized and unified, and we are still studying ways to improve." Regarding this point, the Pingyuan Daily took the following approach: "After the integration of editing, interviewing, and communication, it is very likely to weaken the development of local correspondent organizations and the education of correspondents; in order to make up for this deficiency, we still have a communication section. The personnel in each group who are responsible for communication work belong to the establishment of the communication section, and they live a dual life." It remains to be verified by practical experience what the results of the Pingyuan Daily's approach are, and what the effect of the method of the personnel who are responsible for communication work living a dual life is; but one principle can be affirmed, because our newspaper's correspondent organizations will be developed on a large scale. In the future, the newspaper's correspondents will not be hundreds or thousands of people, but tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people. The leadership of correspondents in the future will be a heavy task; under the principle of the integration of editing, interviewing, and communication, it is necessary to have an independent communication work leadership organization to strengthen the contact between the editorial department and the correspondents.

In short, due to the change in the organizational form and working methods of the editorial department, the connection between the newspaper and reality has been strengthened, the application in work has been more flexible, the quality of manuscripts has been improved, and the planning of editorial department work has been strengthened. These have laid the foundation for improving newspaper work. The shortcomings and difficulties that arise at the beginning of this change can also be overcome. Later, we will see the new achievements after overcoming these shortcomings and difficulties.

However, this does not mean that our newspapers have no problems in connecting with reality. In addition to the shortcomings and difficulties in our work, we have other shortcomings. The Liaodong Youth Daily reviewed their shortcomings in the report, saying:

"The main thing is that the connection with reality is not good enough. Reporting on typical examples is good, but not enough attention is paid to the ordinary work situation, the reflection of the general level of work development, and the problems that must be solved in the journey from the general level to the advanced typical examples. Some places feel: the newspaper introduces it very well, but how to learn? It seems that there is no way to start. Therefore, the guiding role of the work is not strong enough."

The Shenyang Daily also said in the report: "The existing problem is that the connection with the masses is still not close enough, and there are fewer activities of the masses and voices of the masses. The reports on how the instructions and resolutions of the Party and the government are implemented through the masses are not powerful enough. We also paid attention to this issue at the beginning, but not enough, and only understood it one-sidedly, thinking that more feature stories and interviews could solve this problem. In fact, this is not entirely the case.

"For example, the reports on the responsibility system and security inspection, as well as the experience of learning from the Ma Hengchang group, have not penetrated into the group, and the phenomenon of 'running to the upper level' has not been overcome in the interview. The workers have such opinions on us: 'The quality has been strengthened, but it does not help the workers much.'"

This is where our connection with reality is still insufficient. We have changed the organizational form and working methods of the editorial department according to the purpose of facilitating contact with reality; we have improved the relationship with the leading organs and can better understand the overall actual situation. Why are there still these shortcomings? The Shenyang Daily's review is correct. This is because the connection with the masses is still not close enough. Therefore, the specific and vivid reality in the lives of the masses has not appeared more in our newspapers. In order to improve this shortcoming, newspapers must also strengthen contact with the masses. In the future, we will continue to summarize and introduce the situations, experiences, and problems in contact with the masses from various reports for everyone's reference.

　　各地报纸改进工作中的情况、经验和问题
    ——全国各报给新闻总署的五月份工作报告的综合介绍
    新闻总署研究室
    本文所摘引的材料，限于已经收到的一部分工作报告。以后收到的当继续加以介绍。我们希望全国报纸工作者对我们所作的这样一项工作提出意见。
          编者
    四月全国新闻工作会议在新中国新闻事业史上将占据重要的一页，因为这次会议解决了关于报纸、广播电台和通讯社工作中的主要问题；尤其是指出了改进报纸工作的明确的方向。会议结束之后，全国报纸已展开了根据新闻总署发布的《关于改进报纸工作的决定》改进工作的热潮，从五月份的报纸上看，从全国各报给新闻总署的五月份工作报告上看，我们的报纸一般地已有了一些进步，个别的并有了较显著的进步。这还只是全国报纸改进工作的开始，在这些进步的基础上，循着既定的道路大步前进，就会使我们的报纸出现一个全新的面貌。
    这里，首先从各报的工作报告中，摘出有关改组编辑部的组织形式和工作方法，以便加强联系实际的一部分来，说明在这一方面改进工作中的情况、经验和问题。
    从报告中看，各地的报纸绝大多数都已经改变了编辑部的旧的组织形式和工作方法，开始按照社会生活的不同方面实行适当的分工。实行这种改组的结果，证明是好的，报纸与实际的联系加强起来了，报道的内容也随之丰富起来了。
    河北日报在报告中说：“编通采实行统一之后，消除了三者之间过去长期的不协调、互相埋怨的现象，更重要地还在于加强了主动组织稿件的工作，因为编辑工作经过编辑的亲自参加组稿，能开始得到自己所需要的稿件；记者能按照编辑计划更恰当的进行有目的的采访了；通联工作者丰富了组稿退稿的内容，大大提高了通讯员的写稿情绪。不少通讯员来信表示：‘只要出出专题来，一定保证完成。’有的编辑给通讯员讲明为什么如此修改他的稿件后，通讯员来信感激地说：‘这种帮助太大了。’”
    北京新民报“从四月份起，就开始把编采人员分成财经、政治、文教三组，每组三人或两人，各组有组长，及时研讨编采工作，由编辑主任领导，向总编辑负责。这样分工后，使采访活动、稿件质量都有了一些改进。夜班编辑有了出去采访的机会，外勤记者也能写出较充实而有内容的新闻与特写。……
    “……报道工作的深入、改进，使记者从浮面的现象的报道，进入具体的深刻的报道，有的做了较系统的报道。如对调整工商业侧重了私营厂、店通过劳资协商，克服困难，并报道了几个典型。……较有系统报道的有区代表会，从各区的筹备工作，选举代表，开会等都报道的较成功。在报道中指出了会议的意义，初步总结了政府的经验，群众的反映，并批评了工作中的缺点。还有电车公司的好转，从赔钱到赚钱，以及接受合理建议，创造阻水板不怕下雨等发明。这样做，使报纸更接近了广大市民，起到了相当的教育意义。”公营和私营报纸在实行了这种改变之后，工作上都开始有了一些进步。
    改组之后机构灵活了，稿件充实了，编辑、采访、通联的工作都提高了。这就是好处的第一点。
    第二，在前述的基础上，编辑工作开始有了计划性。新湖南报在报告中说：
    “编辑部建立了统一集中的领导，并按着社会生活的不同方面实行分组，……目前总编室已初步做到了根据编委会意图，在各组计划的基础上，制定每周的报道计划。……
    “由于计划性加强，领导统一，新闻报道比过去集中了，各版一般都能做到互相配合，各自为政的情形减少了一些，每天的报纸大都可以看出比较明确的中心，每天评论、报道、读者来信等各种不同形式的稿件，都大体环绕着一个或两个中心，增强了报纸对工作的指导性。”
    松江日报也说到：“五月份我们在争取主动，加强计划性方面，较过去稍有起色，表现我们已开始注意有计划地组织稿件。”但松江日报在加强计划性方面还是有缺点的，他们“在五月份中虽曾主动组织不少稿件，但仍带有盲目性。工业组五十五篇主动组织起来的稿件，尚不是事先有计划系统地组织来的，而是做具体工作同志零星碰到的。……由于组织稿件是零星碰到的，因之具体稿件的题目，事先并没有计划。”
    为什么会产生这样的缺点呢？主要的似乎是在于缺少对实际工作的全面认识，与领导机关缺少必要的密切联系。而改变编辑部的组织与工作也正是为了更好的分工合作，建立与各部门领导机关的密切联系，这就是改组的第三个好处。东北日报在这方面报告他们的经验如下：
    “由于编辑抽空经常到各有关部门了解情况，自己掌握了材料，熟悉了政策，自然能更好地处理通讯员的来稿，而且也更能有目的有计划地发现新闻材料，并当面与通讯员商量如何写作。经过这样组织来的稿件，大部能用，这是转变过去坐在家里，只知向通讯员催稿，而较少能提出具体意见的盲目组织的一个良好的开端。这经验尚需总结和提高，以作为将来发展和提高通讯工作的基础。”
    河北日报也做到了“坚决克服关着门办报的偏向，编辑部领导同志及编辑人员开始走出门去，加强与各部门的密切联系，掌握领导机关的意图与实际工作的情况。除按照自己的分工参加各部门的定期的与不定期的会议外，并在电话上与面谈中经常交换意见。从短短的半月中，已初步体验到加强联系实际能以保持编辑部清醒的头脑，不致形成盲目的领导。但有的编辑人员在参加会议后，尚不善于据此组织报道。”
    改进报纸工作的决定中所说，“改变现有的妨碍联系实际的编辑采访通讯联络等项工作各自为政的状态，建立编辑部门统一集中的领导，并按照社会生活的不同方面实行适当的分组”，对于许多报纸都是一种完全新的课题。在开始实行的时候是会遇到一些困难的，从各地报告中已看出的有以下几个问题。
    首先，实行新的组织形式和工作方法之后，迫切地需要加强编辑部统一集中的领导。河北日报报告他们的经验说：“领导上主要地掌握了四个环节：第一，是紧紧掌握出题目作文章，有重点地有目的地组织稿件，坚决防止与克服因编采通合一而削弱通联工作的倾向。第二，定期地制订一月的编辑计划及每周的发稿计划，使各组的工作有所遵循，不致形成自流。一般的一月计划应提前半月制订，俾便于记者、通联组织报导；计划制订之后，还要进行督促检查并具体帮助实现。第三，是争取从容的时间，除时间性非常强烈的稿件外，一般的稿件均提前两天交稿；特别重要的稿件及言论则不放在当日发稿数内，另行送省委审查后再发排。如此使总编辑有充分的时间来审阅考虑取舍。第四，建立一些必要的会议等制度，如总编室每晚碰头制度，审稿发稿看样制度，记者通讯员稿件处理制度，批评稿件的查询制度及会议汇报制度等。在建立制度中既要力避手续繁杂重叠，又要注意贯彻。抓紧了以上几个环节之后，编辑部的领导上就逐渐地摆脱了事务主义，克服了混乱现象，比较能保持清醒的头脑，争取较充裕的时间，参加领导机关重要的会议，及帮助编辑人员在业务上提高。”就是这样，河北日报“在编辑部的工作上，初步地逐步由被动转入主动”。
    事实上，编辑部加强统一集中的领导问题，主要的是加强编辑工作的计划性问题，有了计划就可以避免领导上的盲目的忙乱状态。苏南日报实行了新的分工之后，稿件的数量大大增加了，这是好现象。但由于预先的估计不足，工作一度陷于被动，现在正以加强计划性来解决这个问题。他们在报告中说：
    “现在编辑部各个组，都在唤稿子多，报纸登不下，老是被压挤下来，影响时间性。稿子多，这是一个好现象。原来怕改版后稿子不够用，没有预先估计到这一情况，因此就没有及早地提出具体办法来，如规定稿件的质量与提出每组每天应发稿的数字来约束各组，并使各组能有目的的在这一范围内每天组织与编辑稿件，并选择与精简稿件。我们没有这样做，结果各组也就盲目地在那里生产，总编办公室每晚统一组版时也就被动，又来不及改编精编，只有天天挤稿子，有些稿子一挤就是几天，而报纸却未能因稿子多了而把稿件质量提高一步。
    “但是，严格地说，我们的稿子现在还不多，而且还太少。有很多地区、很多工作没有报道，或没有很好的报道。因此，我们今后一方面还是要想法子增加稿件的来源。而且相信只要我们肯想办法，稿件还是会增多的；而稿件增多，正是我们提高稿件质量的基础。在另一方面，我们编辑工作上，就应该同时强调更好地编辑与组织稿件。我们除了具体规定各组每天发稿的数量（特殊情形例外），并督促其改进编辑与组织稿件外，还应着重引导编辑记者，如何学习判断新闻的价值，照顾报纸的篇幅，使新闻短些，再短些。”
    苏南日报的这些经验是值得参考的。
    另外一个问题就是实行新的分工之后的通讯员的领导问题，已引起了各报较普遍的注意。长江日报在报告中说到他们现存的问题时说：“第三，通讯工作上发生困难，各组实行编采通合一，通讯员的领导不能集中统一，尚在研究改进办法。”关于这一点，平原日报采取了这样的办法：“编采通合一后，很可能削弱开展地方通讯员组织，及对通讯员的教育工作；为弥补此缺陷，我们仍设有通讯科，各组担任通讯工作的人员，属于通讯科的编制，他们过两重生活。”平原日报的办法实行的结果如何，担任通讯工作的人员过两重生活的方法效果如何，还有待于实际经验的考证；但是有一个原则是可以肯定的，由于我们报纸的通讯员组织还会大量开展，今后报纸的通讯员将不是几百人几千人，而是几万人甚至几十万人，今后的通讯员领导将是一个繁重的工作；在编采通合一的原则之下，同时有独立的通讯工作领导组织以加强编辑部与通讯员的联系是必要的。
    总之，由于改变了编辑部的组织形式和工作方法，报纸与实际的联系加强了，工作上的运用比较灵活了，稿件的质量提高了，编辑部工作的计划性加强了，这些都为改进报纸工作打下了基础。而由于这种改变在开始时所产生的一些缺点和困难也是可以克服的，以后我们将看到克服了这些缺点和困难后的新的成绩。
    然而，这还不是说我们的报纸在联系实际方面已经没有问题了，除了工作中的缺点与困难之外，我们还有另一方面的缺点。辽东青年报在报告中检讨他们的缺点说：
    “主要的是更好地联系实际不够。报道了典型，这是好的，但对普通的工作情况，一般的工作发展的水平的反映上，和一般的水平到先进的典型中间的路程中所必须解决的问题的指出上，则注意得不够。有的地方感到：报上介绍的很好，但怎样学呢？好像无从下手。因此，对工作的指导性还不够强。”
    沈阳日报也在报告中说：“现在存在的问题，是与群众联系的仍不够密切，群众的活动、群众的声音少。党和政府的指示和决议如何通过群众贯彻执行的报道不够有力。开初也曾注意这问题，但注意得不够，只片面地理解，以为多登些特写和访问就可以解决这个问题，事实并不尽然如此。
    “比如责任制和保安检查，以及学习马恒昌小组的经验的报道，均未深入到小组中去，而采访仍未克服掉‘跑上层’的现象。工友对我们有这样的意见：‘质量加强了，但对工人帮助不大。’”
    这就是我们联系实际仍然不够的地方。我们已经按照便于联系实际的目的，改变了编辑部的组织形式与工作方法；我们已经改善了与领导机关的关系，可以更加了解全面的实际情况。为什么还会有这种缺点呢？沈阳日报的检讨是对的，这是由于与群众的联系仍不够密切，因此，群众生活中的具体生动的实际还没有更多地出现在我们的报纸上。为了改进这种缺点，报纸还必需加强联系群众。今后我们将继续把各地报告中关于联系群众中的情况，经验和问题综合起来加以介绍，供大家参考。
