　　US-British Oil Trade Dispute
    Britain Forced to Yield to the US
    Announces Abolition of Rationing System and Allows Import of American Oil
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th] In the struggle between the US and Britain over oil trade, the British government has begun to show signs of yielding.

    At the end of last year, the British government announced that it would reduce imports of American oil starting this year, hoping to slightly delay the depletion of its dollar reserves. However, according to the Associated Press: on May 26th, the British government suddenly announced the abolition of the oil rationing system, which had been in place since the war, effective from the 27th. The increased oil demand resulting from this will be supplied by American oil companies. Although negotiations on the US demand for Britain to lift restrictions on US oil imports are still ongoing, Britain has, in fact, been forced to open its market to the United States.

    As the Associated Press stated, this decision by the British government is the result of its "long and fierce dispute with American oil companies." As soon as the British government announced that it would reduce US oil imports by 5% starting January 1st of this year, the US State Department issued a statement opposing it. The British government had to postpone the aforementioned ban to February 15th under the direct pressure of US Secretary of State Acheson. The US continued to attack Britain and made various threats. The British government's announcement of the abolition of oil rationing is the result of the US exerting this pressure.

    Although the British Minister of Fuel and Power, Noel-Baker, tried his best to deny that this move by the British government would have any adverse consequences for the dollar reserves, which are the lifeline of the British economy, and officials also announced that Britain would pay for American oil in British pounds in cash (United Press), the New York Journal of Commerce revealed that Mobil Oil was able to convert 40% of its income into dollars. United Press also quoted sources from the American oil companies as saying: "It is expected that the British government will give lenient consideration to the issue of American companies converting profits earned in Britain into US dollars." In reality, this move by Britain is a prelude to the abolition of the ban on restricting US oil imports. The aforementioned personnel from the American oil companies believe that this move "has a clear meaning, that is, the British government will now handle these negotiations from a more favorable perspective for American oil companies, and it is expected that American oil will be allowed to compete in the sterling area." Even Reuters believes that: "This is a major step towards the free convertibility of the pound."

    The American oil monopoly capital is clearly not satisfied with the concession that Britain has already begun to make. According to United Press, American oil industry figures said: "The problem has not been solved," "This measure must not relax the company's determination to strive for a solution to what it considers to be a fundamental problem."

### 美英石油贸易之争  英被迫向美表示屈服  宣布取消配给制允许美油入口

　　美英石油贸易之争
    英被迫向美表示屈服 
    宣布取消配给制允许美油入口
    【新华社七日讯】英国政府在美英之间关于石油贸易问题的斗争中，已开始表示屈服。
    去年年底，英政府曾宣布自今年起削减美国石油入口，希望以此稍稍延缓其美元存底的枯竭。但是，据美联社报道：五月二十六日，英政府突然宣布自二十七日起取消自战时以来实行的石油配给制。因此而增加的石油需要，将由美国石油公司供应。虽然美国方面要求英国取消限制美油入口的谈判仍在进行中，但实际上，英国已被迫将其市场向美国开放。
    如美联社所称，英国政府的这一决定，乃是它“与美国石油公司间长期激烈争执”的结果。早在英国政府刚一宣布自今年一月一日起削减美国石油入口百分之五以后，美国国务院即声明反对。英国政府不得不在美国国务卿艾奇逊的直接压力之下，将上述禁令延期到二月十五日起实行。美国方面仍继续向英国进攻，并作出各种威胁。这次英国政府宣布取消石油配给制，就是美国施行这些压力的结果。
    英国燃料大臣诺尔·贝克，虽然曾竭力否认英国政府此举对于作为英国经济命根的美元存底有任何不利后果，官方虽然也曾宣布英国将以英镑现款偿付美国石油（合众社），但是，纽约商务日报却透露，美孚油公司得以其收入的百分之四十兑换为美元。合众社并引美国石油公司方面人士的谈话称：“预料英国政府对美国公司在英国赚到的利润兑换成美元的问题，将予通融考虑。”实则英国此举是取消限制美油入口禁令的前奏。上述美国石油公司的人员即认为：此举“有一个明确的含义，即英国政府目前将从更有利于美国石油公司的观点来处理这些谈判，并且预料将允许美国石油在英镑区从事竞争。”甚至路透社也认为：“这乃是走向英镑自由兑换的一个重大步骤。”
    美国石油独占资本对英国所已开始的屈服，显然并不满足。据合众社报道：美国石油界人士表示：“问题还没有解决”，“这一措施绝不能松懈公司对它所认为是基本问题的解决办法尽力争取的决心。”
