　　Jiangxi Prevents Cattle Disease: 7,000 Cattle Immunized
　　[This newspaper reports] According to Jiangxi Daily: The Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute, in order to safeguard agricultural production in the province and protect draught cattle, is actively carrying out epidemic prevention work. According to the institute's investigation: due to continuous years of flooding throughout the province, straw is scarce, draught cattle suffer from cold and hunger, infectious diseases are prevalent, and the mortality rate of draught cattle is extremely high. After liberation, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government instructed the Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute to carry out cattle disease prevention and control work, producing large quantities of serum and vaccines, and providing free draught cattle immunization injections for farmers. From March to mid-May this year, more than 7,000 head of draught cattle were injected and some sick livestock were treated. The institute is now stepping up the production of serum and vaccines, and has decided to manufacture more than 4 million cc of rinderpest serum this year, injecting at least 150,000 head of draught cattle; it also plans to strengthen research work and train a large number of veterinarians in order to carry out province-wide cattle disease prevention and control work.

　　江西防治牛病  七千耕牛免疫
    【本报讯】江西日报消息：江西省农业科学研究所为了保障该省农业生产，保护耕牛，积极进行防疫工作。据该所调查：全省由于连年水灾，稻草少，耕牛受冷挨饿，传染病流行，耕牛死亡率极高。解放后，江西省人民政府责成省农业科学研究所进行防治牛病工作，大量制造血清及疫苗，免费为农民施行耕牛防疫注射。今年三月至五月中旬，注射了七千多头耕牛，并治疗了一部分病畜。现该所正加紧赶制血清和疫苗，决定在本年度制造牛瘟血清四百万西西以上，至少注射耕牛十五万头；并准备加强究研工作，并大量培养兽医人员，以开展全省性的防治牛病工作。
