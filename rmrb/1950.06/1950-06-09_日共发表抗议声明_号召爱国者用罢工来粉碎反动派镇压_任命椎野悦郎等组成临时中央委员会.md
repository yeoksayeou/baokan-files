    Calling on Patriots to Use Strikes to Crush Reactionary Suppression
    Appoints Etsuro Shiino and Others to Form Provisional Central Committee
    [Xinhua News Agency, 8th] Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party published a statement in Akahata (Red Flag) on the 7th, protesting MacArthur's order to the Yoshida government to "purge" all members of the JCP Central Committee as a violation of the Potsdam Declaration, a four-power agreement. The statement pointed out that the Communist Party is inseparably linked with the Japanese people. The statement called on patriots to use strikes to crush the reactionaries' suppression. The statement declared that sixty-five Japanese trade unions have already decided to hold strikes soon. In the same statement, the Japanese Communist Party announced the appointment of Etsuro Shiino, the former Chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee, and seven others to form a provisional Central Committee to replace the twenty-four Central Committee members who were illegally "purged."
