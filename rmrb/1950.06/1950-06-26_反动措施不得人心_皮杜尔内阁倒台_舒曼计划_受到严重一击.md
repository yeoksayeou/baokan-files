Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 25th: According to Agence France-Presse, the French Bidault cabinet was forced to resign on the 24th after failing a vote of confidence in the National Assembly. The Bidault cabinet was defeated by a vote of 230 to 352 on the question of whether to increase the salaries of civil servants. Bidault had requested the parliament to delete the clause in the civil servant salary bill regarding salary increases in 1950 in order to "balance" his war budget. The Bidault cabinet, due to its pursuit of imperialist war preparations following the United States, its continued colonial war in Vietnam, its suppression of the working people and progressive forces, and other anti-people measures, had long been unpopular. Recently, it has been even more criticized by all sides for openly proposing the traitorous so-called "Schuman Plan". The failure of Bidault's confidence vote will be a serious blow to the already difficult "Schuman Plan."

　　反动措施不得人心
    皮杜尔内阁倒台
    “舒曼计划”受到严重一击
    【新华社二十五日讯】据法新社巴黎消息：法国皮杜尔内阁因在国民议会中举行信任投票失败，于二十四日被迫提出辞职。皮杜尔内阁在关于是否提高公务员薪给问题的信任投票中，以二百三十票对三百五十二票被击败。皮杜尔曾要求议会删去公务员薪金法案中关于在一九五○年增加薪给的条款，以“平衡”其战争预算。皮杜尔内阁由于追随美国从事帝国主义战争准备，继续越南殖民战争，镇压劳动人民及进步力量等等反人民措施，而早已不得人心，最近又因公开提出卖国的所谓“舒曼计划”，而更加遭到各方的责难。皮杜尔这次信任投票的失败，对已经难产的“舒曼计划”，将是一严重打击。
