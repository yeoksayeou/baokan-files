(Dalian News) A report from the Lüda People's Daily: The Guanghe Machinery Factory's foundry has implemented a defective product registration system to clarify work responsibilities, enforce strict rewards and punishments, thereby reducing the defective product rate and improving quality.

Foundry work has always been collective in nature. Each piece of work must go through the joint operation of workers in various departments such as the iron-smelting furnace, mold-making, and core-making. Any slight negligence by workers in any department will affect the quality of the work. Due to the relatively complex nature of the work, it is also more difficult to find the cause and responsible party when a piece of work is scrapped. In addition, the foundry operates on a collective contract basis. If it is impossible to distinguish between good and bad performance and wages are distributed equally, it will inevitably encourage backwardness. For example, in April, six-grade worker Liu Peixi scrapped 186 kilograms of work, but received the same amount of money as six-grade workers Li Zhien and Li Jinfu, who only scrapped 22 kilograms. This hindered the improvement of quality.

The factory's first workers' representative conference passed the responsibility system regulations, which stipulated the following principles in response to the above situation: "Workers' income should be based on the principle of 'to each according to his work' to ensure clear rewards and punishments." "Individuals are responsible for individual mistakes, and collectives are responsible for collective mistakes." In order to implement the method of clarifying responsibilities and enforcing strict rewards and punishments, after nearly a month of repeated publicity and research, it was unanimously agreed to implement a defective product registration system that clarifies responsibilities and a method of implementing rewards and punishments based on this system.

The defective product registration system stipulates that after each group produces defective work, the group leader will immediately fill out a "Group Defective Product Record Form." The record form specifies the date of production, the name and grade of the producer, the output per furnace (number of pieces, weight), the amount of defective products per furnace (number of pieces, weight), and the reason for the scrapping. The responsible party for the defective work and the reason for the scrapping are democratically evaluated by the foundry's Defective Product Evaluation Committee. The committee is composed of one representative (a total of five people) elected by each group and meets regularly for evaluation. If the committee cannot make a decision, it may invite the factory director and technicians to conduct joint research. Once the responsible party for the defective work has been determined, they must stamp the form to acknowledge responsibility. The record form is submitted to the workshop director by the group leader every day and serves as the basis for deducting wages and awarding bonuses according to the reward and punishment regulations that will soon be implemented.

After the implementation of this system, the workers' sense of responsibility has been further enhanced. Some backward workers have begun to correct their careless work attitudes and are being more careful in their work. For example, Liu Peixi's group used to have the worst quality, with a defective product rate often reaching 30%. After the implementation of this system, it has been reduced to 10%. In April, the number of people producing defective products in the foundry accounted for two-thirds of all workers; in May, it has been reduced to less than one-half.

　　广和机械工厂翻砂场
    实行废品登记制度
    分清责任严明赏罚减少废品
    【大连讯】旅大人民日报消息：广和机械工厂翻砂场实行废品登记制度，分清工作责任，严明赏罚，使废品率下降，质量提高。
    翻砂场工作向来是集体性质，每一件活都必须经过化铁炉、模型、芯子等各部门工友共同操作，任何一部门工人工作稍有疏忽，就会影响到活的好坏。由于工作性质比较复杂，作废了活要找出原因和责任者，也比较困难。再加翻砂场是集体包活，如不能分清成绩好坏，而平均分摊工资，势必形成鼓励落后。如该厂四月份，六级工友刘培喜废了一百八十六公斤活，却和只废二十二公斤的六级工友李植恩、李金福得到一样多的钱。因而阻碍了质量的提高。
    该厂第一次工代会通过责任制条例，针对以上情况，规定如下原则：“工友所得应依按劳取酬原则，使赏罚分明。”“个人做坏个人负责，集体做坏，集体负责。”为实行分清责任，严明赏罚的办法，经过将近一个月反复的宣传和研究，一致同意实行分清责任的废品登记制度，和根据这一制度实行奖罚的办法。
    废品登记制度规定各个小组在干出废活后，小组长随即填写“小组废品记录表”。记录表注明出活日期、制作者姓名、级别、每炉产量（件数、重量）、每炉废品量（件数、重量），以及作废的理由。对于废活的责任者和作废的理由，由翻砂场废品评定委员会民主评定。委员会由每一小组推选代表一人（共五人）组成，定期开会评定。委员会如不能决定时，得邀请职厂长和技师共同研究。废活的责任者一经确定，即须在表上盖章承认。记录表每天由小组填送职场长，按照即将实行的奖罚条例的规定，作为扣发工资和奖励的根据。
    实行这一制度后，工友们进一步提高了责任心，部分落后的工友开始纠正马虎潦草的工作态度，干活小心起来，如刘培喜小组过去质量最不好，废品率经常达到百分之三十，实行这一制度后，已降低到百分之十。四月份翻砂场出废品的人数占全体工友的三分之二，五月份已降低到二分之一以下。
