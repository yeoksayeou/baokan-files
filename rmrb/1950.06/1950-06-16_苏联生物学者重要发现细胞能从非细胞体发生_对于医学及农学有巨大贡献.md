　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: According to TASS, Soviet biologist Professor Lepeshinskaya is conducting research on the origin of cells from living organisms and the role of cells in organisms. This research is of great significance to biology and medicine.
    Professor Lepeshinskaya has successfully demonstrated that in living organisms, the formation of new cells occurs not only through the reproduction of cells themselves but also through the development of new cells directly from so-called non-cellular matter (which is constantly present in organisms). This refutes the Weismannist dogma that "cells" can only be formed by the reproduction of other cells and the notion that "there is no life outside the cell."
    Professor Lepeshinskaya recently reported on her research at a meeting of the USSR Academy of Sciences. She demonstrated the possibility of biological organisms and cells developing from the non-structural proteins of various bird eggs. The proteins in eggs are not merely lifeless nutritional media but are living organisms capable of developing and forming cells.
    Distinguished scientists of the USSR Academy of Sciences gave Professor Lepeshinskaya's work a high evaluation. Academician Lysenko believes that this is a major contribution to the development of the Michurin doctrine. The meeting also suggested that Soviet scientists engage in large-scale research in this area and apply the achievements already obtained to medicine and agriculture.

　　苏联生物学者重要发现细胞能从非细胞体发生
    对于医学及农学有巨大贡献
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联生物学家勒柏辛斯卡娅教授，正进行关于细胞从有生物发生的起源、关于细胞在有机体中所起的作用的研究。这一研究对生物学和医学都具有重要的意义。
    勒柏辛斯卡娅教授已成功地证明：在有生命的有机体内，新细胞的形成，不仅是经由细胞本身之繁殖而发生，而且还经由新细胞直接从所谓非细胞体（这是经常都在有机体内存在着的）发展出来而发生的。这就驳斥了魏斯曼主义的教条，即“细胞”仅能由另外的细胞繁殖形成，而且“细胞之外便无生命”的论点。
    勒柏辛斯卡娅教授最近曾在苏联科学院会议上报告她的研究工作。她证明了生物有机体与细胞从各种鸟卵之非结构性的蛋白质中发展出来的可能性。卵中的蛋白质不仅只是无生命的营养媒介物，而是能够发展和形成细胞的有生物。
    苏联科学院的杰出的科学家对勒柏辛斯卡娅的工作给予很高的估价。李森科院士认为这对米丘林学说的发展是一个重大的贡献。会议并建议苏联科学家大规模从事这方面的研究，并把已经获得的成绩应用到医学和农业中去。
