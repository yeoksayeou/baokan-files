　　A County Magistrate in Weinan, Shaanxi, Punished for Violating Policies
    Wei Guangbo (a member of the Chinese Communist Party), the magistrate of Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, repeatedly violated the policies and laws of the People's Government. The leadership repeatedly educated him, but he still refused to correct his mistakes. The Weinan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued him a warning; the Special Commissioner's Office has also submitted a request to the Provincial Government for approval to remove him from his post.
    Wei Guangbo is from Weinan. He joined the revolution in 1932 and had achieved certain successes in his work in the past. Since the liberation of Weinan in May of last year, Wei Guangbo has served as the county magistrate. Over the past year, in his work, he did not seek instructions from higher authorities on principled issues related to policies, but made decisions and handled matters on his own, thus committing many serious errors. For example, not long after the liberation of Weinan, he issued a notice to "Stop paying rent and interest" without seeking instructions from higher authorities. During the takeover period, he used the excuse that the county government had financial difficulties and arbitrarily levied 40 shi and 8 dou of wheat, 52,680 jin of coal, weighing commission, measuring commission, firewood, rafters, and straw braid taxes totaling 1,025,275 yuan in local currency in Weinan City. This aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses and made them doubt the government's tax policies.
    He was also very irresponsible in his financial management. Last year, when collecting public grain, because the masses enthusiastically delivered it and the warehouse was too small to store it, Wei Guangbo did not actively solve the problem, but casually deposited part of the public grain in private flour mills. These flours were neither numbered and sealed nor managed by special personnel. As a result, private merchants privately used more than 60,000 jin, which has not yet been returned. He took more funds from higher authorities than needed for the county government's expenses and issued them late to lower levels. In seven months of last year, he withheld 5.1 million yuan of funds and 14,000 jin of grain from various districts (which were later reissued). Without seeking approval from higher authorities, he arbitrarily used funds to open bookstores, printing houses, and mills as institutional production.
    He had no principles in using cadres. For some cadres from the old liberated areas, he felt they did not suit his "interests," so some of them lived in the county government for more than two months without being assigned work; some were not even given allowances. But for those who were emotionally close to him, he was all smiles and never criticized them.

### 陕西渭南一县长违反政策受处分

　　陕西渭南一县长违反政策受处分
    陕西省渭南县县长魏光波（中共党员），屡次违犯人民政府的政策法令，领导上曾屡次予以教育，但他仍不改过。中共渭南地委已给以警告处分；专署亦呈请省府批准，予以撤职处分。
    魏光波是渭南人，一九三二年参加革命，过去在工作中曾有一定成绩。自去年五月渭南解放后，魏光波就任该县县长。一年来，他在工作中对有关政策的原则性问题，不向上级请示，擅自决定处理，因此犯了不少严重的错误。如渭南解放不久，他竟不向上级请示，擅发“停止交租交息”通知。在接管时期，他借口县府开支困难，擅自在渭南市征收麦子四十市石八斗，煤炭五万二千六百八十斤，秤佣、斗佣、柴、椽、草帽辫等税洋人民币一百零二万五千二百七十五元。引起群众极大不满，使群众对政府的税收政策发生怀疑。
    他平常对财政管理也很不负责任。去年征收公粮时，因群众踊跃送缴，仓库太小放不下。魏光波不积极解决困难，随便将部分公粮寄放私营面粉厂中。这些面粉，既未编号封存，也无专人管理。结果为私商私自动用了六万余斤，至今尚未归还。他对县府经费，向上多领，向下迟发。去年七个月中，他扣发各区经费五百一十万元，粮食一万四千斤（后来已补发）。并未经请示上级批准，随意动用经费，开设书店、印刷馆、磨坊等，作为机关生产。
    他在使用干部方面，毫无原则。对老区来的一些干部，觉得不合自己的“兴趣”，使他们有的住在县府两月多，不分配工作；有的还不发给津贴。但对于跟他情感相投的，则一团和气，从不批评。
