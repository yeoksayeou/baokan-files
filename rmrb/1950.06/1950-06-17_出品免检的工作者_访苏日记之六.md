　　Workers with "Exemption from Inspection" Products
    ——Diary of a Visit to the Soviet Union, No. 6
    At ten o'clock on the morning of May 8th, we, the Chinese delegation, took three cars to visit the Leningrad Machine Factory. Before getting into the cars, everyone happily asked me, "Old Zhao, this time you should be the guide and give us a good introduction to the machine terms." After arriving at the factory, the factory director led us into the workshop. Although I am considered an expert on these machines, I was still a bit dazed by the sight of the giant machines and the lathes spinning at breakneck speed. I ran to a lathe and milling machine to take a closer look, and realized that all the turning and milling were done with diamond steel knives. The first few workshops had automatic lathes, milling machines, hook machines, slotting machines, horizontal boring machines, and eyelet machines, which I could roughly introduce to them. Later, when we got to a few more workshops, there were some machines I had never seen before, and everyone and I had to listen to the introductions given by the machine operators. After turning around and around, we came to a workshop upstairs, and the factory director introduced to me, "All the workers in this workshop are Stakhanovite workers, and the finished products they produce are not inspected at all." We were very surprised to hear this, and we walked to the machines to take a look. There were no male workers at all, and the huge machines were entirely operated by Stakhanovite female workers. We looked at them, and then at the work photos and performance charts on the walls, and we felt their immense greatness. We continued to ask the factory director about the reason for not inspecting the finished products, and the factory director said, "They are all workers of excellent quality. After daily work assessment, they do not produce a single defective product, and after being approved and stamped by the factory director, they can be exempted from inspection. There are such people in all departments." After listening to the factory director's introduction, on the one hand, I felt very ashamed; on the other hand, it also gave me a great encouragement. I am determined to be an "exemption from inspection" worker after returning to my post.

　　出品免检的工作者
    ——访苏日记之六
    五月八日上午十点钟，我们中国代表团分乘三辆小汽车去参观列宁格勒机器工厂。在临上汽车前，大家高兴的问我说：“老赵，这回你应该是向导啦，要好好给我们介绍机器上的名词。”到工厂后，厂长就引着我们进了车间。虽然我对这些机器算内行，可是看见巨型机器，车床飞也似的旋转，使我也有点发蒙。我跑到车铣床跟前仔细一看，才知道全部车铣都是用钻石钢刀工作。头几个车间是自动车床、铣床、钩床、插床、躺床、眼床，这些我还能大概给他们介绍一下；后来再到几个车间，有些机器我从来就没有看见过，大伙和我只好听机器使用者的介绍。转来转去转到一个楼上车间，厂长向我介绍说：“这个车间全部工人都是斯达哈诺夫工作者，她们生产的成品全不检查。”我们听了非常惊讶，走到机器跟前去看，一个男工也没有，巨大的机器完全是斯达哈诺夫式的女工驾驶，我们看看她们，又看看壁上的工作照片和成绩表，我们感觉到她们无比的伟大。我们继续的问厂长成品不检查的道理，厂长说：“她们都是优良品质的工作者，经过日常工作的考查，不出一件废品，被厂长批准盖章后，就可以免检。像这样的人各部分都有。”我听了厂长的介绍，一方面感觉十分惭愧；一方面也给我一个很大的鼓舞。我决心回到工作岗位上后，也要作一个出品免检工作者。
