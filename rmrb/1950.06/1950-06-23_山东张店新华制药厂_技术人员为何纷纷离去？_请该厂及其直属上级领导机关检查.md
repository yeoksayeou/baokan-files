To the Editor:

I am a technician at the Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory in Shandong. After graduating from the East China People's Revolutionary University last year, I was assigned to work in the engineering section of the Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory in Zhangdian City, Shandong. Since arriving at the factory more than half a year ago, there have been constant errors and disputes caused by principled deviations in administrative and trade union leadership. At that time, although criticism meetings and wall posters were used to start discussions, the criticisms were fruitless. In the end, the only option was to make suggestions to superiors level by level. However, most of the suggestions disappeared without a trace once they reached the section chief. Some even lost the original copies of the suggestions. It was even more difficult to see the factory director. How can we ring the bell of democratic management? Now I have no choice but to raise the issue in the newspaper.

Currently, the main problem is the mass departure of technicians, and some are preparing to leave. What is causing such a great sense of unease at work? This is mainly because:

(1) Leading comrades and some veteran cadres are prejudiced against technicians from petty-bourgeois backgrounds. For example, the engineering section chief (a veteran cadre) said in an article published on the wall newspaper this year: "The children of the bourgeoisie in the old society, in order to climb on top of the people, used the formula of time plus money to obtain qualifications; thus, those who studied military affairs became warlords, those who studied politics became bureaucrats, and those who studied economics and natural sciences became managers and engineers."

(2) Misuse of talent. Take me as an example: I am a pharmacist with more than ten years of experience. Unexpectedly, because I made suggestions about eliminating "disorder" in the product and packaging when I arrived at the section, the entire set of packaging and design work was piled on me. At first, when I made some suggestions about the work, everyone said that my attitude and temper were bad, and they mobilized the masses to "criticize" me.

(3) Administrative leaders pretend to know what they don't know and are obstinate. From group leaders and section heads to section chiefs and factory directors, few are not complacent about their technical knowledge. Therefore, the correction of a technical error requires multiple debates and persuasions. For example, some people once made soda rhubarb into a kind of tablet called Jianwei Pian (Stomachic Tablets), saying that it was formulated according to a prescription from the Japanese Pharmacopoeia. As a result, the prescription could not be found, but they did not have the courage to scrap this batch of dozens of kilograms of wrongly formulated and poorly made (wet granulation was mistakenly used instead of dry granulation) raw materials, so they insisted on making this batch of things and pushing it to the market. They didn't care about the impact on patients. To give another example: For some reason, the factory put aside the existing pharmacists and researchers in the factory some time ago and hired a technician from Qingdao who claimed to have many years of experience in manufacturing liver extract. In a room in the Qingdao business department, with the simplest equipment (not even a decompression device), more than 10,000 ampoules of liver extract were made. Without bacterial examination, animal testing, let alone pharmacological experiments, it was packaged up. After preparing the leaflets, it was sent to a hospital in Jinan.

(4) The trade union and the Party and Youth League have not done enough to unite new cadres, and they do not have an in-depth understanding of everyone's ideological situation. At gatherings, we often hear: "What's so great about technicians? The Communist Party is about to liberate the whole country. If you don't want to work, just leave, there are plenty who are willing to come!" They do not use methods of unity and transformation to win over new cadres, but use unpleasant words to stimulate new cadres. How can the relationship between new and veteran cadres be improved in this way? Xin Litian and someone surnamed Zhang asked the director of the research office (concurrently the engineering section chief) for a long leave to prepare for college entrance exams. The director was drunk and said: "Okay, if you want to leave, just leave!" Intellectuals are sensitive, how can their thinking not waver? An engineer who is responsible and works actively also wants to resign. The problems are not too complicated, and they are all caused by family burdens that have created ideological burdens. The treatment of these senior technicians is also too poor, less than half the salary of a senior technician. The administrative side may be too busy to take care of it; how can the Party not understand the ideological situation of important technical personnel?

The attitude of our factory towards the retention of technical personnel seems to be gradually becoming clearer recently. Recently, when I talked to the section chief about work, he said: "The factory is developing towards enterprise management, and it is free to stay or leave. If you want to leave, it is better to talk directly to the factory director." The implication is that if you are not satisfied with the work, there is no problem with resigning, but if you want to improve the working conditions, it may not be easy. I have never intended to resign, and I am not prepared to resign.

Now the situation has been explained. But after writing for so long, I have only talked about some situations related to technical personnel. If necessary, I will talk about other aspects later. I hope the editor will express an attitude on this issue and give me more instructions.

Editor's Note: According to the situation reflected in the above letter, the Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory in Zhangdian City, Shandong Province, has biases in its leadership thinking and style, especially in the relationship between cadres and the masses and in uniting technical personnel. We hope that the responsible cadres of the factory and the competent authorities directly leading the factory will earnestly investigate the situation of the factory, take effective measures, and correct the existing biases. And tell us the actual situation and the results of the handling.

### 山东张店新华制药厂  技术人员为何纷纷离去？  请该厂及其直属上级领导机关检查

专栏：

　　山东张店新华制药厂
    技术人员为何纷纷离去？
    请该厂及其直属上级领导机关检查编辑同志：
    我是山东新华制药厂的技术人员。去年由华东人民革命大学毕业后，被分派到山东张店市新华制药厂工务课工作。来厂迄今已半年多了，中间不断的发生一些由于行政和工会领导上的原则性的偏差所造成的错误和纠纷。当时虽经批评会及墙报上展开讨论，但是批评以后毫无结果。最后只有按级向上面提建议。但建议多半是一到课长那里就如石沉大海。有些连建议的原件都找不到了。厂长更难见到。怎样来把民主管理的钟敲响呢？现在我只有把问题提到报纸上来。
    目前，主要的问题是技术人员的纷纷离去，有的正准备离去。什么原因造成这样大的不安于工作的现象呢？这主要是因为：
    （一）领导同志和一些老干部对小资产阶级出身的技术人员有偏见。例如工务课长（老干部），今年在墙报上发表的一篇文章里说：“旧社会的资产阶级子弟为了爬到人民头上，于是用时间加金钱这公式来取得资格；于是学军事的当了军阀，学政治的就成了官僚；学经济和自然科学的就成了经理和工程师。”
    （二）用人不当。拿我做例子来说：我是一个工作了十多年的药剂师。不料因我到课时对出品、包装提出了应该消灭“杂乱无章”的意见，于是就把整套包装、设计工作堆到我头上来。起初我稍微对工作提了点意见，大家就说我态度脾气不好，发动群众“检讨”我一顿。
    （三）行政领导同志强不知以为知，刚愎自用。下起组长、室长，上至课长、厂长很少不在技术上自满的。因此，一个技术上的错误的纠正，就得准备多次的争论与说服。例如有的曾经把苏打大黄打成一种名叫健胃片的药片，说是根据日本药局的药方配成的。结果却找不到那个药方，但又没有勇气把这批数十公斤配错而又做坏（应用干法制粒，误用了湿法）的原料报废，就硬把这批东西做出来推到市场上去。至于对病人的影响如何就不管了。再举一个例子：厂方不知何故，前些时放着厂里现有的药剂师、研究员们不用，在青岛聘了一位自称有多年制造肝精经验的技工。在青岛营业部一个房间内，以最简陋的设备（连减压装置都没有）就做了一万多安瓿的肝精。既未经细菌检查，也没有经动物试验，药理实验更不必说，就叫包装起来。准备好仿单，送到济南医院去了。
    （四）工会和党、团方面对团结新干部做得不够，对各人的思想情况了解不深入。在集会时经常听到：“技术人员有什么了不起？现在共产党快把全国解放了。不愿干只管走，有的是愿来的！”他们不用团结、改造的方法来争取新干部，而是用不好听的话来刺激新干部。这样新老干部的关系怎能搞好？辛力田和一位姓张的向研究室主任（工务课长兼）请长假，准备去考大学。主任喝醉了，说：“好，你们要走就走吧！”知识分子是敏感的，思想上怎能不动摇？一位负责而且工作积极的工程师也要辞职。问题都不太复杂，说起来都是因家庭负担造成了思想负担。这些高级技术人员的待遇也太差，比高等技工的工资一半还不到。行政方面或许因为事务忙顾不到；党的方面怎好连重要技术人员的思想情况都不了解呢？
    我厂对技术人员去留的态度近来似乎渐趋明确。最近，我向课长谈工作，他就说：“厂子正向企业化发展，去留都是自由的。如果要去时，直接向厂长谈更好。”言外大有你如不满意工作，辞职并无问题，但如要想改善工作情况，那恐怕不大容易之意。我一直就没有打主意辞职，更没有准备辞职。
    现在情况都已说明了。但是写了半天，只说了一些有关技术人员的情况。尚有关于其它方面的情形，如果需要的话，以后再谈。希望编辑同志就这问题表示态度，并给我多多指示。

    编者按：根据上面这封信所反映的情况来看，山东张店市新华制药厂在领导思想和作风上，特别是在干群关系及团结技术人员等方面，是存在着偏向的。我们希望该厂负责的干部及直接领导该厂的主管机关，切实调查该厂的情况，采取有效办法，纠正现存的偏向。并将实际情况和处理结果告诉我们。
