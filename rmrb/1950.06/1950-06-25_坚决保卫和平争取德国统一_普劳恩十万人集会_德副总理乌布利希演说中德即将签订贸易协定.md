Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 24th: According to TASS, Plauen in Saxony, German Democratic Republic, held a National Front Day on the 18th. On that day, a rally of 100,000 people was held under the slogan of defending peace and restoring German unity.

　　German Democratic Republic Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht delivered a speech at the meeting, pointing out that the struggle to defend peace must be strengthened especially because the Democratic Germany can only be built under conditions of peace.

　　Ulbricht said: Although the enemies of the democratic system oppose the government of the German Democratic Republic, they cannot prevent the further planned development of the democratic economy. The diplomatic representatives of the German Democratic Republic have begun activities in various People's Democratic countries, and the diplomatic personnel who have arrived in Beijing are about to prepare to sign a broad trade agreement.

　　When discussing the proposal of the Western High Commissioners regarding the so-called "free elections," Ulbricht pointed out that the German people are able to establish their election system and do not need to import such a system from the United States or Britain. The High Commissioners must give the German people the opportunity to choose their future path. They must withdraw the occupying forces and give the German people freedom and independence.

　　Ulbricht finally pointed out: The election on October 15th will show that the German people are willing to fight for peace and democratic construction. This day should and must become a powerful recognition of a peace-loving, democratic, and unified Germany, and a recognition of friendship with the Soviet Union and peace-loving forces worldwide.

    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国萨克森州的普劳恩，曾于十八日举行全国阵线日。当天在保卫和平与恢复德国统一的口号下举行了十万人的大会。
    德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希在会上发表演说，指出要格外加强保卫和平的斗争，只有在保持住和平的条件下，民主德国才能进行建设。
    乌布利希说：虽然民主制度的敌人反对德意志民主共和国政府，但他们不能阻止民主经济的进一步有计划的发展。德意志民主共和国的外交代表，已在各人民民主国家开始活动，而已经抵达北京的外交人员，即将准备签订一项广泛的贸易协定。
    乌布利希在论及西方国家高级专员关于举行所谓“自由选举”的建议时指出：德国人民能够建立他们的选举制度，用不着从美国或英国输入这种制度。高级专员们必须给德国人民自己选择他们未来道路的机会。他们必须撤退占领军，给德国人民以自由与独立。
    乌布利希最后指出：十月十五日的选举，将表明德国人民愿为和平与民主建设而斗争。这一天，应该而且势必成为对于爱好和平的、民主与统一的德国的有力承认，以及对于与苏联及全世界爱好和平力量的友谊的承认。
