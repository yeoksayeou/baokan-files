　　Tangshan Railway Factory Workers
    Write to Chairman Mao Reporting Production Success
    Half-Year Production Target Completed Ahead of Schedule at the End of May
    Striving to Complete the Entire Year's Production Target Before the October Revolution Anniversary
    [Our Dispatch] The workers of Tangshan Railway Factory completed their half-year production target by the end of May and specially wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to report this good news. The original letter is as follows:
    Chairman Mao:
    At the end of the red May, we are pleased to have completed the half-year production target and the team wants to report this good news to you.
    Chairman Mao! You are always thinking of the people and us workers, and working so hard. We have many heartfelt things to say to you. From the day Tangshan was liberated, the demons who made us suffer were driven away. We have changed from the status of "coolies" and slaves in the old society under Kuomintang rule to masters of the country and society. The Staff and Workers Representative Council and the Factory Management Committee have been established in the factory, and we are participating in factory management, which makes us feel so much more comfortable. During the Kuomintang rule, we were forced to eat sorghum flour, "Man Tian Fei" (a type of coarse bread), and peanut skins; after liberation, we receive wages in kind, and we eat our fill and wear warm clothes. Recently, prices have stabilized, and life is getting better and better. When we think of these things, we think of you, and we work with extra vigor.
    In March this year, our factory launched the New Record Movement. Everyone knows that it is for the rapid construction of a new country, and we are working enthusiastically! In just over two months, we created 2,400 new records and 97 inventions, making production in March and April exceed the plan. During the production competition in red May, everyone worked even harder, burying their heads and working straight through. By the end of the month, we added it all up and found that we had not only completed the half-year production task, but also produced an extra 0.3 locomotives, 84.9 passenger cars, and 16.9 freight cars. Everyone was so happy to see this and thought: "Producing one more locomotive will give the country more strength and support the liberation war to fight Taiwan. At the same time, the country will become stronger day by day, and the imperialists will never dare to bully us again!"
    In the course of production, we encountered many difficulties. The vehicles entering the factory were too badly damaged, and there was a shortage of materials. Couplers, springs, and other parts had to be found in the scrap heaps. As a result, we not only completed the task but also saved 1,194,847 jin of millet in material costs.
    In response to the Central People's Government's call for thrift, all kinds of expenses are used sparingly. We saved 3,276,618 jin of millet in management fees in five months. In addition, we had a surplus of 7,632,934 jin of millet in five months, greatly reducing the cost of repairing vehicles.
    There has also been progress in production management. We are learning modestly from the Soviet elder brother and the advanced factories of our brothers in the Northeast. We have begun to establish a production responsibility system, implemented a production chart system on a trial basis, formulated liaison contracts between workshops, and initially adjusted labor organization to gradually move the factory towards enterprise management.
    Although we have made some achievements, we are not complacent. Everyone is confident that we will continue to work hard to improve the quality of vehicle repairs, reduce unnecessary work, and improve production further. We are determined to complete the original full-year production task set by the ministry before the October Revolution anniversary. We will write to you again then. Wishing you good health!

                                     May 31st
    [Our Dispatch] At 3:00 p.m. on May 31st, the Tangshan Railway Factory of the Ministry of Railways completed and exceeded the Ministry's designated production target for the first half of 1950 one month ahead of schedule, announcing the successful realization of the huge production plan for red May. In the past five months, the factory has earned a profit surplus of more than 7.63 million jin of millet; totaling over 22.8 million jin of millet in wealth created for the state. The Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Tangshan Municipal People's Government, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Competition Committee have all sent letters to the railway factory to express their congratulations. All the workers of the railway factory also wrote a letter to their beloved leader Chairman Mao, reporting their production achievements, and expressed their determination to complete the annual production task before the October Revolution anniversary.
    On March 1st of this year, the Tangshan Railway Factory officially launched the New Record Creation Movement, and has completed and exceeded its production targets every month. Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Ministry of Railways, arrived at the factory on May 16th to congratulate and give a report, announcing that the Ministry of Railways would award the Tangshan Railway Factory 10,000 jin of millet, which inspired all the workers even more. After the red May production and conservation modeling competition movement was launched, the railway factory faced a series of difficulties. For example: the locomotives entering the factory for repairs in May were too badly damaged, and 29 of the damaged locomotives needed furnace repairs. The number of boilers requiring the fitting of screw stays and iron plates was more than double that of April. Completing such a task with the existing manpower and machinery was a major difficulty. In addition, the track wall of the crane was repaired in mid-May, and more than half of the mechanical equipment and work sites could not be used; the damaged freight cars to be repaired did not enter the factory until May 13th; and there was a shortage of materials (shortage of car pots, shortage of springs, and inability to match strips), which made the difficulties even more serious. The person in charge of the factory resolutely implemented the policy of democratization of management, trusted and relied on the workers, did a good job in the Factory Management Committee and the Staff and Workers Representative Council; strengthened the planning of work, learned from the experience of the Northeast, promoted the production chart system, adjusted the labor organization, allocated manpower and machinery, adopted the operation mode of people resting and machines not stopping, implemented the specialized vehicle repair system, and generally established contact contracts. These measures brought into play the unparalleled strength hidden in the workers, and ultimately overcame these difficulties and created excellent results. Whether it was locomotives, passenger cars, freight cars, castings, or forgings, the half-year task was overfulfilled.

　　唐山铁路工厂全体职工
    给毛主席写信报告生产喜讯
    上半年生产任务已于五月底提前完成
    争取十月革命节前完成全年生产任务
    【本报讯】唐山铁路工厂职工到五月底就完成了上半年的生产任务，特地写信向毛主席报告这个喜讯。原信如下：
    毛主席：
    红五月的月底，我们高兴地完成了上半年的生产任务，大伙愿意向你报告这个喜信。
    毛主席！你处处为人民和为我们工人着想，太辛苦了，我们有许多心事话要和你诉说。从唐山解放那天开始，就把我们受苦的恶魔赶跑了。从旧社会把我们看成“工化子”奴隶的地位，变成了国家社会的主人。工厂里成立了职工代表会和工厂管理委员会，我们参加工厂管理，心里可痛快多了。国民党统治时候，让我们吃高粱面、“满天飞”、“花生皮”；解放后，发实物工资，吃的饱穿的暖；近来物价平稳，日子更好过得多了。我们想到了这些，就想到了你，干起活来，也就特别起劲。
    今年三月，我们工厂开展新纪录运动，大家知道是为着快些建设新国家，干的可热火啦！两个多月创造了两千四百件新纪录，发明创造就有九十七件，使三、四月份生产都超过计划。在红五月的生产竞赛中，大家更努了劲，都闷着头直干，到了月底，我们合计起来，不但完成了半年生产任务，而且还多出了机车○·三台，客车八四·九辆，货车一六·九辆。大家一看真高兴，想着：“多出一辆火车头，就给国家增了一份力量，也支援了打台湾的解放战争，同时使国家就一天天强盛起来，帝国主义就再也不敢欺侮我们了！”
    在进行生产时候，我们碰到不少困难。进厂车辆破损的太厉害，材料缺乏，车钩、弹簧等件都到废铁堆去翻。结果不但完成了任务，还节省材料费一一、九四八、四七○斤小米。
    为响应中央人民政府节约号召，各种开支都省着用，五个月省下管理费三、二七六、六一八斤小米，另外我们五个月还盈余七、六三二、九三四斤小米，把修车的成本费大大减低了。
    在生产管理方面，也有进步。我们虚心向苏联老大哥和东北的兄弟先进工厂学习，开始建立了生产责任制，试行了生产图表制，订立各场间联系合同，初步调整了劳动组织，使工厂逐步走向企业化。
    我们虽然有了些成绩，可是并不自满，大家有信心继续努力，提高修车质量，减少反手活，把生产再提高一步。决心在十月革命节前完成原部定全年的生产任务，那时候再给你写信吧。祝你身体健康！
                                唐山铁路工厂全体职工
                                     五月三十一日
    【本报讯】五月三十一日下午三点钟，铁道部唐山铁路工厂，提前一月完成并超过部定一九五○年上半年的生产任务，宣布如期实现红五月的巨大生产计划。五个月来，该厂共获得利润盈余七百六十三万多斤小米；总计为国家创造财富达二千二百八十余万斤小米。中共唐山市委、唐山市人民政府、市总工会、市竞赛委员会纷纷致函铁路工厂祝贺。铁路工厂全体职工也向自己热爱的领袖毛主席写信，报告生产成绩，并表示决心在十月革命节前完成全年生产任务。
    今年三月一日，唐山铁路工厂正式开展了创造新纪录运动，每月都完成并超过了生产任务。铁道部滕代远部长特于五月十六到达该厂祝贺并作报告，宣布铁道部奖给唐山铁路工厂一万斤小米，全体职工更加振奋。红五月生产节约创模竞赛运动展开后，铁路工厂面临着一连串的困难。例如：五月份进厂修理的机车破损得太厉害，破损机车有二十九个需要吊炉。锅炉需要配装螺丝撑和铁板的，比四月份增加两倍以上。在原有人力和机器设备条件下，完成这样的任务，是一个大困难。再加上五月中修理起重机跑道墙，一半以上的机械设备和工作场地不能使用；待修的破损货车直到五月十三日才进厂；以及材料缺乏（短少车锅，短少弹簧，无法配条）等原因，困难显得更严重。该厂负责人坚决贯彻管理民主化的方针，相信工人，依靠工人，搞好了工厂管理委员会及职工代表会；并加强了工作中的计划性，吸取东北经验，推广生产图表制，调整劳动组织，配备人力和机器，采用人歇机器不停的运转方式，实行专责修车制，普遍订立联系合同。这些办法，发挥了蕴藏在工人身上的无比力量，终究克服了这些困难，创造了良好的成绩，无论机、客、货车和铸件、锻件，都超额完成了半年任务。
