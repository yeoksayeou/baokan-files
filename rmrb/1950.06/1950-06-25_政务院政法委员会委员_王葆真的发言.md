(Xinhua News Agency, June 24th) The following is the full text of the speech given by Wang Baozhen, a member of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Government Administration Council, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 22nd:

Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Fellow Committee Members, Comrades:

I have read Vice-Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the land reform issue and the draft Land Reform Law. These are for completing the greatest and most fundamental historical task in the Chinese revolution. It can thoroughly solve problems that countless wars over thousands of years have failed to resolve. It can lay the foundation for the true interests of the vast majority of the people. It grasps the fundamental factors of social and economic disputes and is based on practical land experience. This report and draft are exactly in line with the long-held wishes of us revolutionary comrades. We have fought for the revolution for many years but have not been able to achieve or solve what we have now been able to in recent years due to Chairman Mao's correct leadership. How happy and excited we should be! How enthusiastically we should support it! I think that after this law is passed and implemented, people will no longer have to worry about social order being constantly turbulent, or about the disparity between the rich and the poor, the oppression of landlords, or the lack of security in life. Therefore, we earnestly hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible.

I have seen that since the farmers in various regions of North China obtained land through land reform, they have actively supported the front lines of the revolutionary war, delivered public grain, and volunteered for military service. The People's Liberation Army has received the support of the broad masses of the people, and is invincible, winning unprecedented victories in history. This clearly proves that land reform meets the demands of more than 80% of China's population, the peasants. This is clearly the correct step and method of "land to the tiller." Our support for land reform did not begin today. In the spring of 1948, I saw the Land Law of the Liberated Areas and Chairman Mao's instructions correcting the errors in the implementation of land reform in the Taiyue Mountain area and other regions. Chairman Mao's instructions were not to cause unnecessary harm to the people due to land reform. Just like Vice-Chairman Liu's report today, in the great movement of the people's liberation and social revolution, not only did the vast working people gain land and liberation, but at the same time, the lives of landlords and rich peasants were taken care of. Such greatness and fairness have long been worthy of the sincere admiration of us revolutionary comrades.

I was originally a member of the Kuomintang. Why did I resolutely oppose the Nanjing Jiang government? Why did I consistently oppose the Northern warlords for many years and resolutely carry out the revolutionary movement? It was because they could not implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of equal land ownership. Therefore, the failure of the Xinhai Revolution was because there was no land reform. The failure of the Nanjing Kuomintang was also because there was no land reform. The warlords, bureaucrats, and party members of reactionary factions like Chiang Kai-shek not only abandoned Dr. Sun's legacy of equal land ownership, but also disregarded the interests and power of the working masses, only knowing how to protect bureaucratic capital and feudal landlords, arbitrarily exploiting and embezzling, making it impossible for the majority of the Chinese people to live. Their delusion of relying on imperialism to suppress the people's revolution was doomed to failure. Fortunately, with the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the working people have been liberated, and the Chinese land revolution has been put into practice. This revolution will certainly not fail again. I feel that those who can understand "equal land ownership" should cherish the revolutionary united front and firmly support the central government's land reform policy. Moreover, the Land Reform Law is very attentive and thorough. When land reform initially started, village and district cadres inevitably had some deviations in their work. I had raised some opinions with the authorities at that time. Now, past experiences have been summarized, and past shortcomings have been overcome. Land reform will be better completed. This is something that we no longer need to worry about today. Therefore, I need to state that for all true revolutionary comrades, with a basic understanding of the truth, supporting the central government's land reform policy is natural and absolute. Comrades who truly fight for the revolution have even sacrificed their personal lives, so how could they still be attached to the old land system and unwilling to advance towards the paradise of the new society? Our support for land reform is not just empty slogans, but we must also strive to assist and actively carry it out, striving to achieve the great victory of comprehensive land reform, complete a stage of the people's revolution. Comrades, it should be an honor for all to be able to fulfill a share of responsibility for this great historical land reform. Today, based on the perspective of the interests of the people of the whole country, we should pay tribute to Chairman Mao and the responsible comrades who led the arduous struggle of the great land revolution. At the same time, we should also extend our greetings to the local comrades who have worked hard to correctly implement the central government's land reform policy.

    王葆真的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】政务院政治法律委员会委员王葆真二十二日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席、副主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我读了刘少奇副主席关于土改问题的报告和土地改革法草案，都是为了完成中国革命中一个最伟大最基本的历史任务。他能够彻底解决了几千年来多少次战争所不能解决的问题，他能够奠定了最大多数人民真实利益的基础，他是抓紧了社会经济纷争的根本因素，而结合实际的土地经验以决定的。这个报告和法案，正是符合我们革命同志多年来的愿望。我们多年来，为革命奋斗不能得到的成就，不能解决的问题，近几年来因为毛主席正确的领导，解决了，成就了，我们该是何等欣快兴奋！该是何等热烈拥护！我想本法案通过实行后，一切的人们，再不必忧虑社会秩序常常动荡不安了，再不必忧虑贫富悬殊、地主压迫、生活无保障了。所以我们恳切的希望他早日施行。
    我看到华北各地区的农民，自从土改分得了土地以后，他们支持了革命战争的前线，送缴公粮，请愿参军，都是很踊跃的。人民解放军得到了广大人民的支援，所向无敌，赢得了历史上空前未有的胜利，这显然证明土改，是顺应中国人口百分之八十以上的农民的要求，这显然是“耕者有其田”的正确的步骤和办法。我们拥护土改，不自今始，我在四八年春季，看到解放区土地法，又看到毛主席纠正太岳山区及各区执行土改错误的文告，毛主席的指示，是不愿因土改而使人民受到不必要的损害，正如今天刘副主席的报告一样，是在伟大的人民翻身，社会革命的运动中，不但使广大的劳动人民，获得了土地，获得了解放，而且同时照顾到地主富农的生活，这样伟大而公平，早就值得我们革命同志的衷心倾佩。
    我原来是国民党人，为什么坚决反对南京蒋政府？为什么多年一贯的反对南北军阀，坚决进行革命的运动？就是为了他们不能实行孙中山先生平均地权的主张。所以辛亥革命的失败，是因为不土改。南京国民党的失败，也是因为不土改。蒋介石一类反动派的军阀、官僚、党徒们，不但背弃了孙先生平均地权的遗教，并且漠视了劳动群众的利益与力量，只知道保护官僚资本和封建地主，任意剥削贪污，使中国大多数的人民都不能生活。妄想依赖帝国主义镇压人民革命，其失败是早已注定的了。幸有毛主席和中共的领导，劳动人民才获得了解放，中国土地革命，才见诸实行，这次革命，当然不会再失败了，我觉得能够了解“平均地权”的人们，便应当爱护革命的统一战线，便要坚决的拥护中央的土改政策。况且土地改革法案，是很注意周到的。当最初土改时，村区干部在工作中，不免有一些偏差，我当时曾向当局提过一些意见。现在，已是总结了过去经验，克服了过去的缺点，土改将会更好地完成。这一层至今天更不必顾虑了。所以我需要说明，凡是真实的革命同志，基本真理的认识，拥护中央土改的政策，是当然的，是绝对的。真实为革命奋斗的同志们，连个人生命都付之牺牲了，岂还有留恋旧土地制度，而不肯向新社会的乐园前进吗？我们拥护土改，不只是空喊，更要努力赞助，积极进行，务求达到全面土改的伟大胜利，完成人民革命的一个阶段，同志们，能够为这伟大的历史性的土改，尽到一分责任，都该是感觉到很荣幸的了。今天，我们基于全国人民利益的观点，应当向领导艰苦斗争伟大的土地革命的领袖——毛主席和各位负责的同志们致敬。同时，也应当向为了正确地执行中央土改政策而艰苦奋斗的地方同志们，敬致慰问。
