　　Model Military Family Member Wang Hualan
    Narrated by Farmer Meng Xianlian, Recorded by Zhou Rongxian
    Military family member Wang Hualan is the Women's Chairperson of Taohuabu Village, Tieshan District, Yinan County, Shandong Province. She is twenty-seven years old this year. Her family has seven mu of land. She actively participates in the mutual aid team to cultivate her own land.

    Wang Hualan has been working in agriculture since she was a child. After her husband joined the army, she learned to do everything from plowing and planting to weeding and harvesting. In the autumn, there was a lot of rain, and the mud in the fields was very deep. Wang Hualan rolled up her trousers and went to the fields to cut crops, chop sorghum, and carry grain. At first, some people criticized her behind her back, saying, "What a good wife, she's like a man, covered in mud and water, looking like a mud monkey." But Wang Hualan didn't care about people's ridicule and continued to work hard. She understood that women can only achieve true equality by actively participating in labor. She believed that while her husband was fighting on the front lines, she should focus on production at home and strive to be a model worker. Her wish has already been realized. She has been selected as a labor model in Tieshan District.

    She not only participates in labor herself but can also actively mobilize all the women in the village to participate in labor. During plowing, she organized a group of young women to work together. She and female youth league member Wang Lianxiang worked together to transport manure, one pushing and one pulling. Each cart could carry three hundred catties. During spring weeding, she worked "equally" with the men, and could weed half a mu every day.

    After spring planting last year, the government called on everyone to weed wheat. Some people were not convinced. Wang Hualan then went to female youth league members Wang Lianxiang, Meng Xianlian, Wang Yuehua, and others to discuss how to mobilize all the women in the village to respond to the government's call to weed wheat. They then convened a village women's meeting, mobilized twenty women, formed a large team, and divided them into wheat-weeding mutual aid groups. At this time, some parents disagreed with weeding wheat and even said to their daughters who participated in weeding wheat, "Go weed other people's wheat! Our wheat doesn't need weeding." When they first started weeding, no one knew how. Wang Hualan patiently taught everyone, and the women learned enthusiastically. In just three days, they weeded 120 mu of land and picked up all the weeds. When the wheat was harvested, the land that had been weeded yielded more grain.

    This year, the government again called for weeding wheat. Wang Hualan and female league member Meng Xianlian, etc., told everyone at the women's meeting about the benefits of weeding wheat and their achievements in weeding wheat last year, and mobilized the women to participate in weeding wheat. The women all believed it. Before the meeting was over, some women clanged and carried out their hoes. As a result, many women participated, including eight elderly women and many military family members. That day, everyone gathered to weed wheat.

    The women were very enthusiastic when they worked. During breaks, the young women learned to read or sing together, and the old women followed along. Under their influence, the whole village started weeding wheat enthusiastically. In three days, the whole village's wheat was weeded.

　　模范军属王化兰
    农民 孟现莲说  周荣贤记
    军属王化兰是山东省沂南县铁山区桃花埠庄的妇女会长，今年二十七岁。她家里有七亩地。她积极参加变工组，耕种自己的土地。
    王化兰从小就干庄稼活。丈夫参军后，耕、种、锄、收，她都学着做。秋天雨水多，地里泥水很深，王化兰把裤腿一挽就下地割庄稼、砍秫秫、挑谷子。开始时，有些人见了就在背后乱批评，说：“怪好一个媳妇，像男人一样泥里来水里去的，弄得像个泥猴。”可是王化兰却不管人家笑话，仍是一个劲儿的猛干。她懂得妇女只有积极参加劳动，才能得到真正的平等。她认为丈夫在前方作战，自己在家应该好好生产，争取做个劳动模范。她这个希望已经实现了。她已被选为铁山区的劳动模范。
    她不但自己参加劳动，还能积极动员全庄妇女都参加劳动。耕地时，她组织了一伙青年妇女，大伙在一块干活。她和女青年团员王连香两人合一把车子送粪，一个推一个拉。一车可运三百斤。剜春时，她和男子“平打平”的干，每天都能剜半亩。
    去年春种以后，政府号召大家锄麦子。有些人不大信服。王化兰便去找女青年团员王连香、孟现莲、王月华等，讨论如何发动全村妇女，响应政府锄麦子的号召。她们便召开了全村妇女会，动员了二十个妇女，编成一个大队，分成锄麦互助小组。这时，还有些家长不同意锄麦，竟对他们参加锄麦的女儿说：“去锄旁人的麦吧！俺家的麦可不用锄。”乍锄地时，大家都不会。王化兰耐心地教大家，妇女们学得很起劲。只有三天功夫，她们就锄了一百二十亩地，并把草都拾干净了。到麦收时锄过麦子的地都多收了粮食。
    今年政府又号召锄麦，王化兰和女团员孟现莲等便在妇女会上把锄麦的好处和她们去年锄麦的成绩告诉大家，并动员妇女们参加锄麦。妇女们都相信了。会还没开完，有的妇女就叮叮当当的把锄抗了出来。结果，参加的妇女很多，其中还有八个老年妇女和不少军属。当天，大家就集合起来锄麦去了。
    妇女们干活的时候都很起劲。在休息时，青年妇女们大家在一块学字或者唱歌，老大娘们也跟着大家唱。在她们的影响下，全村热火朝天地锄开了麦。三天功夫，全村麦子都锄了一遍。
