Examples of Applying the Marriage Law to Resolve Marriage Cases
    A Glimpse of the Beijing Municipal People's Court's Work in Clearing Backlogged Cases
    Chen Hong
    "The fundamental principle of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China is to completely destroy the shackles imposed on the people by the long-term feudal system in marriage relations. Its legislative spirit is to overthrow the 'husband power' domination centered on men and protect the legitimate interests of women and children." (People's Daily Editorial)
    Based on the basic spirit of the New Marriage Law, the Beijing Municipal People's Court, in this clearance of backlogged cases, has given decisive, prudent, and reasonable solutions to marriage cases involving arranged, forced, and buying marriages, early marriages, bigamy, concubinage, child brides, and abuse and persecution of daughters-in-law by parents-in-law and husbands in the family.
    Here are a few examples:
    Liu Xiulan requested a divorce, but her husband refused. The court mediated the divorce.
    This spring, the People's Government of the 17th District of the suburbs forwarded to the Municipal People's Court a case of unsuccessful mediation: A rural woman named Liu Xiulan firmly requested a divorce from her husband, Liu Fuming, but her husband always refused.
    In May, in court, Liu Xiulan righteously stated her reasons: "When I was fifteen years old, I married into the Liu family. After marriage, my relationship with Liu Fuming was always bad. I suffered beatings and scolding from his family. They (referring to her husband and mother-in-law) once forced me to hang myself and jump into a well. This marriage was arranged and forced by my parents. I couldn't object at the time, but now that we are liberated and marriage is free, I am determined to divorce him, otherwise I really can't stand it!"
    Her husband could not offer any "counter-evidence" to these facts, nor did he have any reason to force Liu Xiulan to continue living with him. He only stubbornly argued before the court judges: "I am thirty-five years old this year. We had a good relationship for ten years after marriage, but after the land reform, she became bad to me."
    Indeed, after the liberation of Beijing, especially after the implementation of land reform in the suburbs, Liu Xiulan, who had endured ten years of grievances and pain, quickly changed. She actively participated in the land reform and strived to learn and improve herself. Due to the rapid improvement of her political consciousness and working ability, she is now the honorable deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of Wudaomiao Administrative Village in the suburbs. What she could endure before, she can no longer endure now. In order to seek her own complete liberation, she is fighting against the dark and corrupt feudalism.
    After investigating the actual situation, the judge asked her: "What do you plan to do after the divorce? What conditions do you have?" "I have labor power. I can go back to my parents' home to engage in production. Anyway, I just want to leave him. I don't want anything from his family except my clothes."
    The court considered her reasons to be legitimate, so it patiently persuaded Liu Fuming, explained the spirit of the New Marriage Law to him, and warned him and his mother that they must never use such barbaric means to treat other women again. Finally, both parties agreed to divorce, and the court issued a divorce mediation statement to close the case.
    Marital dissolutions caused by abuse of women after marriage account for a large number in all marriage cases.
    After Pan Shuqin's divorce, the man bears the living expenses, and the person who abused her will also be subject to criminal trial.
    The court ruled on the divorce case between female teacher Pan Shuqin and her husband, and treated the lawsuits against the defendant's mother, He, for abusing her daughter-in-law and grandson to death, and the husband for defrauding the woman of her property, as criminal cases.
    Pan Shuqin is currently a teacher at a primary school in Beijing. In 1947, she was introduced to Fang Xuanfu in Beijing by their parents. The Fang family was a landlord family in Zhenhai County, Ningbo, Zhejiang. The wedding was held according to old customs, with all six rites complete. However, shortly after the marriage, all of Pan Shuqin's dowry jewelry and clothing were taken away by the Fang family. Later, the Fang family returned to their hometown of Zhenhai from Beijing via Shanghai, and her husband, Fang Xuanfu, went to Guangzhou for business.
    Pan Shuqin wrote in her complaint: "Since arriving in Zhenhai, I was simply managed like a prisoner. I worked all day at home. My mother-in-law did not allow me to talk to neighbors, let alone communicate with my family in Beijing or even my husband in Guangzhou. Their letters were often opened or hidden." She continued: "My child was born safely, but the Fang family did not give him clothes to wear, saying that there were rules in the south that children could only wear clothes from their maternal grandmother's house within three years of birth. Due to insufficient nutrition during the pregnancy, the child suffered from an eye disease. He cried day and night, but the defendant, He (her mother-in-law), refused to treat him. Soon the child went blind. At this time, the mother-in-law said even more bitterly: 'Such waste is better off dead!' She also declared: 'My son has fallen in love with someone else outside and has already married. You are still living shamelessly in the world. Anyway, I don't want to support you!' The child's condition became more and more serious. The defendant forced him to be placed in the toilet, saying, 'If the child dies in this house, the room will not be habitable for a year.' And before the child had stopped breathing, she wanted to hire someone to bury him."
    After suffering all kinds of torture and torment, Pan Shuqin was forced to commit suicide by drowning in Zhenhai, but was fortunately rescued by neighbors.
    Last year, Ningbo was liberated, and the Fang family, fearing being liquidated and struggled against, fled to Shanghai. At the same time, they sent Pan Shuqin to her parents' home in Beijing, and also lied to her: "Your husband has gone to the United States. You wait at your parents' home!" However, not long after, Pan Shuqin discovered that Fang Xuanfu had not gone to the United States, and was in Beijing with He and others. Therefore, she bravely sued the court, demanding justice for her.
    In addition to ruling that they were divorced and that the man was responsible for the woman's living expenses, the court, in accordance with the principle of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women and children under the Marriage Law, handed over their past series of crimes, such as abuse, abandonment, infanticide, and defrauding property, to the criminal court for sentencing.

　　适用婚姻法解决婚姻案件的实例
    京市人民法院清理积案工作之一斑
    陈泓
    “中华人民共和国婚姻法制定的基本原则，是要彻底摧毁中国长期封建制度在婚姻关系上所加于人民的枷锁，它的立法精神是要推翻以男子为中心的‘夫权’支配，保护妇女和子女的正当利益。”（人民日报社论）
    根据新婚姻法的基本精神，北京市人民法院在这次清理积案中，对包办、强迫、买卖、早婚、重婚、纳妾、童养媳以及在家庭中翁姑和丈夫虐待与迫害媳妇等等婚姻案件，都给了果断、慎重合理的解决。
    下面是几个实例：
    刘秀兰要求离异，丈夫不愿意，法院调解离婚。
    今年春天，郊区十七区人民政府向市人民法院转报一件调解无效的案件：农村妇女刘秀兰坚决的要求和她丈夫刘富明离婚，但她的丈夫总不愿意。
    五月在法庭上，刘秀兰理直气壮申诉了她的理由：“当我十五岁那年，我就嫁给刘家了，结婚之后，我和刘富明的感情始终不好，我受尽了他家的打骂，他们（指丈夫婆婆）曾逼得我上吊、跳井，这个婚姻是我父母强迫包办的，当时我怎么反对也不行，可是现在解放了，婚姻可以自由了，我坚决要和他离婚，不然我实在受不了啊！”
    对于这些事实，她的丈夫提不出任何“反证”，更没有理由一定要强迫刘秀兰再跟他继续同居。只是在法院审判员面前强辩着说：“我今年三十五岁，结婚十年来我们感情还好，只是搞土改以后，她就对我不好了”。
    的确，北京解放后，特别是在郊区实行了土地改革，那忍受了十年委屈和痛苦的刘秀兰很快的改变了，她积极的参加土改，努力学习要求上进，由于政治觉悟和工作能力的迅速提高，她现在已经光荣的当了郊区五道庙行政村青年团副支书，原先能忍受的事情，现在再也不能忍受了。为了求得她自身的彻底翻身，她与黑暗腐朽的封建主义展开斗争。
    审判员调查了实际的情况后问她：“离了以后，你打算怎么办呢？你有什么条件？”“我有的是劳动力，我可以回娘家搞生产，反正我只要离开他就行，他家的东西除了我的衣服外我什么也不要。”
    法院认为她的理由正当，因此就耐心的说服刘富明，给他讲解新婚姻法的精神，并警告他和他母亲，以后绝不能再用如此野蛮的手段来对待其他妇女。最后，双方同意离婚，并由法院发给离婚调解成立书结案。
    由于婚后女方受虐待而造成的婚姻离异，在全部婚姻案件中占着较大的数字。
    潘书琴离婚后，男方负担生活费，虐待她的人还要受刑事审判。
    法院判决了女教员潘书琴与她丈夫的离婚案件，并将被告之母贺氏虐待媳、孙致死和丈夫骗取女方财物的诉讼案，作为刑事犯处理。
    潘书琴，现在任教北京市某小学。一九四七年在北京经人介绍由双方父母作主与方轩福结婚。方家是浙江宁波镇海县的地主，婚礼是依照旧俗举行，六礼具备。但是婚后不久，潘书琴所有陪嫁的首饰衣物等，全被方家索去。后来方家由北京经上海返回原籍镇海，她丈夫方轩福赴穗经商。
    潘书琴在诉状里写道：“自从到了镇海，我简直被管束得像囚犯一样了，我在家里成天操作，婆婆不许我和邻居谈话，更不许我和北京家里乃至广州的丈夫通信，他们来信也常被拆看或藏匿。”她继续写道：“我的小孩平安的生了下来，可是方家不给衣服穿，说什么南方有规矩，小孩出世三年内只能穿外婆（姥姥）家的衣服。由于产期营养不足，小孩患了眼病，他日夜啼哭，但被告贺氏（她婆婆）拒绝为他医治，不久小孩就双目失明了。这时婆婆更发恨的说：‘这样的废物不如早死！’又声言：‘我儿子在外已另有所恋，且已结婚，你们还无耻地活在人间，反正我是不想养活你们了！’小孩的病愈来愈重了，被告强迫把他放在厕所里说‘假如小孩死在这房屋里，那房间在一年内都不能住人的’。并在小孩还未断气的时候就要雇人把他掩埋。”
    受尽了一切折磨和摧残，潘书琴在镇海曾被迫投河自杀，幸被邻居发现救活。
    去年宁波解放，方家怕被清算、斗争而逃到了上海，同时把潘书琴送到北京娘家，还骗她说：“你丈夫去美国了，你在娘家等着吧！”但是，相隔不久，潘书琴发现方轩福并未去美国，并和贺氏等一起都在北京，因此她勇敢的向法院起诉，要求为她伸冤。
    法院除判决他们离异，由男方负担女方生活费外，并按照婚姻法保护妇女和子女合法利益的原则，将他们过去一连串的罪行如虐待、遗弃、溺婴、和骗取财物等交刑庭判处。（未完）
