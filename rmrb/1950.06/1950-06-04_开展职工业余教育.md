The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has issued the "Instructions on Developing On-the-Job Education for Workers," which is a major measure taken by the People's Government in accordance with Article 47 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which calls for "strengthening the spare-time education of workers and the on-the-job education of cadres."

The instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government are based on the experiences gained from the widespread development of spare-time education across the country. According to statistics from last year alone, there were 340 spare-time cultural schools in the five provinces of North China; and more than 2,110 workers' spare-time schools nationwide, with more than 751,000 workers participating in learning. More spare-time schools have been established throughout the country this year. Taking Beijing and Tianjin as examples, the number of students enrolled in various spare-time schools in Beijing has reached more than 57,000; and the number of students enrolled in spare-time schools in Tianjin is more than 35,000. These spare-time education programs, which are widely carried out throughout the country, have not only achieved remarkable results in improving the cultural level of workers and staff; but also gained many good experiences in the work of spare-time education. In terms of principles, content, systems, organization, and leadership, they have created a certain scale based on realistic conditions. The instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government were issued after summarizing these experiences and should be universally implemented throughout the country.

In the instructions of the Government Administration Council, it is first pointed out that "developing on-the-job education for workers and staff is one of the most important ways to improve the political, cultural, and technical levels of the broad masses of workers and staff." This is because the construction of the country needs to rely on the broad masses of workers and staff, and it also requires these broad masses to have a high level of development in politics, culture, and technology, and these masses can only learn in their spare time. For the long-term interests of the country and based on the current conditions, developing "spare-time education" is one of the important tasks that should be given great attention. On the issue of spare-time study, the Government Administration Council specifically stipulated in item 8 of the instructions: "The study time should be carried out outside of working hours. General classes and technical classes must have at least two study sessions per week; intermediate classes, advanced classes, and political classes must have at least three study sessions per week, each lasting at least ninety minutes. Those who participate in study on study days may be exempt from extra overtime and from participating in various meetings and activities." This provision, on the one hand, ensures the production or work time of workers and staff, and on the other hand, ensures their study time. Such a guarantee is extremely necessary. Studying for three sessions of ninety minutes (a total of four and a half hours) per week is not too much, and it should be said that it is entirely possible to achieve. However, under the existing conditions, it still requires the joint and persistent efforts of the enterprise management organs and the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations in various places to thoroughly realize it.

The learning content and methods listed in the instructions of the Government Administration Council include four items: literacy education, higher-level on-the-job cultural education for workers and staff, political education, and technical education. And it specifies: "The content of on-the-job education for workers and staff should focus on literacy education, and various and regular methods can be adopted to carry it out." Therefore, literacy education is listed as the first item in the instructions, and higher-level spare-time cultural education is listed as the second item. This is because not only is diversified literacy education a mode of education that can be universally and massively developed, but also because literacy education is the foundation of all education. The Government Administration Council stipulated in the third item of the instructions: "Political education for workers and staff can be carried out through current affairs reports, thematic lectures, and other methods. In larger factories and enterprises, worker political classes can be set up to absorb workers with a certain level of education to participate." This is based on this spirit. Therefore, in addition to carrying out general reporting and lecturing political education among workers and staff, the focus of spare-time education should be literacy education. Only by improving the level of education can there be a possibility of improving the study of political theory. Eliminating illiteracy and improving the level of education should be the primary task of on-the-job education for workers and staff.

Chairman Mao instructed us in his book "On Coalition Government": "Eliminating illiteracy from 80 percent of the population is a necessary condition for building a new China." The development of on-the-job education for workers and staff is, of course, only a prelude to the nationwide work of eliminating illiteracy and popularizing education. Popularizing education first starts with workers and staff, not only because workers and staff are more concentrated, and education is easier to carry out, but also because the working class is the leading class of new China, and must first master culture in order to more effectively play the role of the leading class. Let the activists of the working class and the intellectuals who are willing to serve the working people work together to carry out the glorious task given to us by the Government Administration Council!

### 开展职工业余教育

　　开展职工业余教育
    中央人民政府政务院发布《关于开展职工业余教育的指示》，这是人民政府根据政协共同纲领第四十七条中《加强劳动者的业余教育和在职干部教育》的一个重大措施。
    中央人民政府政务院的指示，是根据全国各地正在普遍发展的业余教育所得到的经验，总结出来的。按去年一年的统计，仅华北五省所开办的业余文化学校，有三四○所；全国的工人业余学校达二千一百一十多所，参加学习的工人有七十五万一千多人。今年在全国各地开办的业余学校更多。单以京津两市而论，北京的各种业余学校入学人数达五万七千多人；天津业余学校的入学人数在三万五千以上。这些在全国各地普遍开展的业余教育，不但在提高职工文化程度上收到显著的成效；而且在业余教育的工作中，取得很多良好的经验。无论在方针、内容、制度、组织和领导上，都根据现实的条件，创造出一定的规模。中央人民政府政务院的指示，正是总结了这些经验发布出来的，应该在全国各地普遍执行。
    在政务院的指示中，首先指出：“开展职工业余教育是提高广大工人职员群众的政治、文化与技术水平的最重要方法之一。”这是因为国家的建设需要依靠广大的工人和职员群众，也需要这些广大的群众在政治、文化和技术上有高度的发展，而这些群众只能在业余的时间来进行学习。为了国家的远大利益和根据目前的条件，开展“业余的教育”是重要的工作之一，应该受到极大的重视。在业余学习的时间问题上，政务院在指示的第八项中特别规定：“学习的时间应在工作时间以外进行，普通班和技术班每周至少须有两次学习；中级班、高级班和政治班每周至少须有三次学习，每次至少九十分钟。在学习日参加学习者，可不作额外加班，并免除其参加各种会议活动。”这个规定，一方面保证了工人和职员群众的生产或工作的时间，另一方面又保证了他们的学习时间。这样的保证是极有必要的。每周以三次九十分钟（共四小时半）的时间来进行学习并不算多，应当说是完全可能做到的，但是在现有条件下要加以彻底实现，仍然须要各地企业管理机关以及党、团、工会的组织共同作坚持的努力。
    政务院在指示中所列的学习内容和方式，包括识字教育、较高级的职工业余文化教育、政治教育、技术教育等四项。并且指明：“职工业余教育的内容以识字教育为重点，可采取多种多样并能保持经常的方式来进行。”因此在指示中把识字教育列为第一项，较高级的业余文化教育列为第二项。这是因为不但多种多样方式的识字教育，是一个能够普遍大量发展的教育方式，而且因为识字教育是一切教育的基础。政务院在指示的第三项中规定：“职工的政治教育，可用时事报告、专题讲演等方式进行。在比较大的工厂、企业中，可设立职工政治班，吸收有相当文化程度的职工参加。”就是根据这个精神规定出来的。因此，在职工中除了进行一般的报告讲演的政治教育以外，业余教育的重点应当是识字教育。只有提高了文化程度，才有提高政治理论学习的可能。扫除文盲，提高文化程度，应该是职工业余教育首要的工作。
    毛主席在《论联合政府》一书中指示我们：“从百分之八十的人口中扫除文盲，是建设新中国的必要条件。”开展职工业余教育，当然还只是全国扫除文盲、普及教育工作的一个先奏。普及教育先从职工开始，这不但是因为职工比较集中，教育进行较易，而且因为工人阶级是新中国的领导阶级，必须首先掌握文化，才能更有力地发挥领导阶级的作用。让全国工人阶级的积极分子和愿为劳动人民服务的知识分子们共同努力，来执行政务院所给予我们的光荣的任务吧！
