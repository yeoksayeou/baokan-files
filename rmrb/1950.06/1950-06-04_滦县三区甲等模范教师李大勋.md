　　Luan County's Third District First-Class Model Teacher, Li Daxun

    Li Daxun, a teacher at the Xianhe Village School in the Third District of Luan County, Hebei Province, was recently selected as the first-class model teacher for the entire district at the Third District's Model Teacher Election Conference. The Xianhe Village School had been abandoned for many years and was only restored after liberation. There are a total of 101 school-age children in the village. Comrade Li Daxun used various methods to mobilize children to attend school, and the number of out-of-school children gradually decreased. Now, the number of boys and girls enrolled has reached 86% of all school-age children, and one classroom could no longer accommodate them, so another classroom was added. Since he began teaching, he has consistently worked actively and has a spirit of serving the cause of education for life. Last November, he suffered from sores and was unable to move. He leaned on crutches and had difficulty walking and sitting. He leaned over the desk to teach, persisting in this way for more than a month. This year, due to financial difficulties in the village, he has only received 120 jin of salary rice since the beginning of the school year, which is not enough to maintain the minimum standard of living. However, his spirit of serving the people remains the same. During the noon break, he also tutors some students who have asked for leave due to lack of labor in their families, and conducts individual education or extracurricular supplementary education for different students according to the requirements of students and parents. For example, he teaches bookkeeping and abacus to the children of tofu shops and noodle shops. Therefore, he has won the support of students and parents. He is also able to help out-of-school youths study in his spare time. Li Haozhong, who is eighteen years old, dropped out of school after the third grade of elementary school. Comrade Li Daxun tutored him at night, and his studies were not delayed. Now Li Haozhong has been admitted to the sixth grade of the Youzha Village Elementary School in the district.

　　滦县三区甲等模范教师李大勋
    河北滦县三区西安河村学校教师李大勋，最近在三区选举模范教师的大会上，被选为全区甲等模范教师。西安河村学校已经荒废多年，解放后才恢复起来。村中学龄儿童共一百零一名。李大勋同志用各种方法动员儿童入学，失学儿童逐渐减少。现在男女入学儿童竟达全部学龄儿童百分之八十六，一个教室容纳不下，又添了一个教室。他自任教以来，一贯工作积极，具有终身为教育事业服务的精神。去年十一月间，他因生疮，不能行动，双手扶着拐棍，步行、坐立都很困难，伏在桌上授课，这样坚持了一个多月。今年因村中财政困难，他从开学到现在，仅支领薪米一百二十斤，不够维持最低生活。但他为人民服务的精神，始终如一。在晌午休息时间，他还给一些因家庭缺乏劳动力而请假的学生补课，并针对学生及家长的要求，对不同的学生进行个别教育或课外补充教育。如对豆腐房、面铺的子弟，教以记账、珠算等。因此得到学生及家长的拥护。他又能在课余时间帮助失学青年学习。十八岁的李好忠，在小学三年级就失学了，李大勋同志在夜间给他补课，学习没有耽误。现在李好忠已考入了该区油榨村完小六年级学习。
