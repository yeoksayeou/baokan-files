    Stable Prices, but RMB Can't Keep Up with Demand
    Silver Dollars Re-circulating in Parts of Henan
    Provincial Finance Committee Decides to Organize RMB Circulation to Rural Areas
    [Report from this newspaper in Henan] Since prices stabilized and currency contracted in various parts of Henan Province, there has been a shortage of RMB in the market. As a result, silver dollars have re-circulated in some areas, which has drawn the attention of the Provincial Finance Committee. They have decided to organize the circulation of RMB to rural areas. It has been discovered that silver dollars or copper coins are being used for transactions in parts of the four special districts of Huangchuan, Huaiyang, Shangqiu, and Xinyang. According to investigations, silver dollar transactions account for 75% of market transactions in Shangcheng, and about 40% in Huangchuan and Guangshan. The proportion is smaller in Xiping and Xincai, accounting for 20% to 25% of transactions. In addition, silver dollars and copper coins are also in circulation in the counties of Zhengyang, Runan, Queshan, Suiping, Shenqiu, Huaiyang, Luyi, Xiangcheng, Taikang, Xiayi, and Zhecheng. The main reason is not that people don't want to use RMB, but that they feel there is too little RMB. The masses in Shibalimiao in Runan said, "There are so few bills, what can we spend?" Therefore, the Henan Provincial Finance Committee has decided to organize various specialized companies and cooperatives to systematically inject RMB, purchase agricultural products, and sell daily necessities, in order to invigorate finance, regulate supply and demand, and prevent silver dollars from circulating in the market.

    物价稳定人民币赶不上需要
    河南部分地区又流通银元
    省财委会决定组织人民币下乡
    【本报河南讯】河南省各地自物价稳定，通货收缩后，市场人民币短少，因而白洋又在部分地区相继流通，已引起该省财委会注意，并决定组织人民币下乡。现潢川、淮阳、商邱、信阳四个专区的部分地区已先后发现有用银元或铜元进行交易的。据调查，商城银元交易占市场成交量百分之七十五，潢川、光山亦占百分之四十左右，西平、新蔡较少，占成交量百分之二十至二十五。此外，正阳、汝南、确山、遂平、沈邱、淮阳、鹿邑、项城、太康、夏邑、柘城各县亦有银元和铜元的活动。主要原因，并不是人民不用人民币而是嫌人民币太少。汝南十八里庙群众就是这样说：“票子这样少，花什么？”因此，河南省财委会已决定组织各专业公司和合作社有计划的投放人民币，收购农产品，推销日用品，以活泼金融，调剂供求，使银元不再在市场上行使。
