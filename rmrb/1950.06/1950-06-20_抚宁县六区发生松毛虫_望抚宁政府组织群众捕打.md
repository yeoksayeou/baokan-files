　　Pine Caterpillar Infestation in the Sixth District of Funing County - Hoping the Funing Government Organizes the Masses to Catch and Kill
To the Editors:
    Pine caterpillars have broken out extensively in the northeastern part of the Sixth District of Funing County, Hebei. We went there to investigate. First, we went to the district office and asked how large the affected area was. They said they didn't know and seemed indifferent to the problem. Many mountains in the area are forested. The masses mostly rely on the mountains and forests to maintain their lives. Chief Wang of the County Agricultural and Forestry Section also went to Wanghangou, Majiagou, Dengjiagou, and other villages to organize the masses to kill the insects once. A total of 180 people were mobilized, and in two days, they caught 40 jin of insects, eliminating the pine caterpillars on one mountain. However, since Chief Wang left, no cadres have taken charge. Currently, the affected area covers approximately 45 li, and the trees eaten by the insects account for 40 percent of all trees. Farmers take the insect-eaten trees home to burn as firewood. According to them, the insect outbreak began as early as 1948 and has become more severe each year. The largest insects are more than three cun long. These insects produce two generations each year, one between April, May, and June, and the other between July, August, and September. Now is precisely the time when they are about to turn into moths and lay eggs. We hope that the Funing County People's Government will quickly organize the masses to catch and kill them to avoid losses to the people.

　　抚宁县六区发生松毛虫  望抚宁政府组织群众捕打编辑同志：
    河北抚宁县六区东北部，普遍发生了松毛虫。我们到那里去调查，先到区公所，问虫灾有多大面积？他们说不知道，似乎对这问题漠不关心。当地很多山地是森林。群众多半是依靠山林来维持生活的。该县农林科王科长，也曾到王汉沟、马家沟、邓家沟等村，组织群众打了一次虫。共发动群众一百八十名，两天内，打虫四十斤，消灭了一个山头的松毛虫。但自王科长走后，就没有干部管了。现在灾区面积方圆约有四十五里，被虫吃过的树，占全部树木百分之四十。农民们将虫吃过的树，抱回家中当柴烧。据他们说，虫的发生，早在一九四八年，此后一年比一年厉害。最大的虫有三寸多长。此虫每年产生两代，一代在四、五、六月间；一代在七、八、九月间。现在正是将要变蛾产卵的时候。我们希望抚宁县人民政府迅速组织群众，进行捕打，以免人民受到损失。
