　　Huangmei First District Party Secretary Embezzles and Engages in Malpractice; Huanggang Prefectural Committee Imposes Disciplinary Action

　　Hou Jianshan, the Secretary of the CCP Huangmei County Xiaochi District Committee in Hubei Province, has continuously violated policies and engaged in embezzlement for personal gain since taking office last summer. He has now been severely punished by the Party. The facts of his errors are listed below:

　　First, after the district experienced flooding last autumn, a small number of disaster victims used silver dollars to buy things. Hou Jianshan took advantage of the district office's name to privately print silver dollar confiscation certificates and sent people out to confiscate silver dollars. On one occasion, he confiscated ten silver dollars, two gold rings, and a pair of gold earrings in the twelfth bao of Xiaochi District under the pretext of investigating opium.

　　Second, Hou Jianshan privately printed and forcibly sold travel permits in the name of the district office, stipulating that pedestrians must have them and that they must have their own photos attached. He gave the travel permits to the Xiaochi Photography Studio to sell on his behalf, charging three to five sheng of rice per permit. He admitted that he had sold more than 500 copies in total, and the travel permits were numbered over 700.

　　Third, he organized a dozen or so vagrants to cut down more than 70 trees on the dike under the guise of collecting firewood. He also introduced these people to the bank to borrow 800,000 yuan. As a result, some of the vagrants ran away or went into hiding, and the loans have not been recovered to this day.

　　Fourth, last year, the higher authorities allocated 5,000 jin of rice, instructing the district to buy medicine for the masses to treat illnesses. However, he hired three doctors at a salary of 60 jin of rice per person per month to open a cooperative in the street, allowing sick people to spend money at the cooperative for treatment. As a result, poor people who could not afford treatment did not receive timely medical care.

　　Fifth, last winter, the masses struggled against the local tyrant landlord Wang Renwang, demanding that he compensate 15,000 jin of grain. The local tyrant landlord could have compensated it all at once, but Hou Jianshan stipulated that 1,000 jin should be delivered before the New Year, 1,000 jin before the tenth day of the first lunar month, and the remaining 13,000 jin should be delivered after the wheat harvest this year. The masses were very dissatisfied. Later, when the CCP County Committee sent people to handle the matter, the local tyrant landlord Wang Renwang quickly handed over all 15,000 jin of grain that he was supposed to compensate.

　　Last year, after the CCP Huanggang Prefectural Committee discovered Hou Jianshan's misdeeds, it instructed the CCP Huangmei County Committee to first remove him from his position. However, the County Committee felt that there were few cadres, and thus showed hesitation and connivance, only transferring him from Xiaochi District to Caishan District, where he still served as the Chairman of the District Peasants' Association and participated in the CCP District Committee. Recently, in order to rectify cadre discipline, the CCP Huanggang Prefectural Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee has decided to remove Hou Jianshan from his position as District Party Secretary and give him a punishment of being placed on probation within the Party for half a year.

### 黄梅一区书贪污舞弊黄冈地委给予处分

　　黄梅一区书贪污舞弊黄冈地委给予处分
    湖北省黄梅县小池区中共区委书记侯建山，自去年夏天到职后，接连违犯政策，贪污自肥。现已受到党的严厉处分。兹将其错误事实列举如下：
    第一，去年秋天该区水灾发生后，少数灾民使用银洋买东西。侯建山就利用区公所名义，私印银洋没收证，派人四出没收银洋。有一次，他以清查鸦片为名，在小池区十二保没收了银洋十元、金戒指两个、金耳环一对。
    第二，侯建山以区公所名义私自印发并强卖通行证，规定行人必备，且都要贴本人相片。他把通行证交给小池照相馆代卖，每张索价三升到五升米。他承认前后共卖了五百多张，通行证的号数已有七百多号了。
    第三，他组织了十几个流氓，以打柴作借口，砍了堤上七十多棵树。他又介绍那些人到银行借款八十万元。结果那几个流氓跑的跑，躲的躲，借款迄今无法追还。
    第四，去年上级拨五千斤米，叫该区买药品给群众治病。他却以每人每月六十斤米的薪金请了三个医生在街上开合作社，让患病者往该社花钱治病。致无钱治病的贫苦群众，得不到及时治疗。
    第五，去年冬天，群众斗争恶霸地主王任旺，要他赔出粮食一万五千斤。该恶霸地主本可一次赔偿出来，而侯建山却规定：年前交一千斤，正月初十以前交一千斤，其余一万三千斤延到今年麦收时交清。群众非常不满。后来该县中共县委派人去处理时，恶霸地主王任旺应赔偿的一万五千斤粮食很快都拿出来了。
    去年中共黄冈地委发觉侯建山的劣迹后，就指示中共黄梅县委首先予以撤职处分。但该县县委认为干部少，因而表现犹豫、姑息，只把他从小池区调到蔡山区，仍当区农会主席，并参加中共区委会。最近中共黄冈地委会为了整饬干部纪律，地委纪律检查委员会已决定撤销侯建山区委书记之职，并给以留党察看半年的处分。
