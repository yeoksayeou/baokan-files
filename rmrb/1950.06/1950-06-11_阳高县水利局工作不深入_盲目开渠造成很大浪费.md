　　Yanggao County Water Bureau's Work is Not Thorough
    Blindly Digging Canals Causes Great Waste
    To the Editors:
    East of Yangjiabao Village, District 9, Yanggao County, Chahar, a canal was dug in late April. It took half a month to complete the entire canal, using 1,800 workers and borrowing 2,250 jin of grain. After inspection, the canal was found to be unusable, resulting in a waste of manpower and resources. The reason is that the county People's Government has serious bureaucracy, and the Yanbei Special Prefecture has a careless style of work. The area, from Zh窝沟 village in the north to Yangjiabao in the south, originally had a sand river, running diagonally from the southeast of Yangjiabao village and the northwest of Liulin village into the Liulin River. This river only flows during heavy rains and is otherwise dry all year round. In April last year, Feng Huan, a staff member of the county government's industry department, without careful consideration, blindly proposed to block the river course three li south of Zh窝沟 village and dig a new canal one and a half li long, attempting to divert water into an earthen ditch to turn some of the dry land in Yangjiabao village into paddy fields. This plan was immediately opposed by the masses, who said, "This water only comes once in ten years, it is a waste of manpower and resources to build the canal." If the original river course is blocked and water is diverted into the new canal, there will be no drainage canal downstream of the new canal, which will wash away 300 mu of farmland in Liulin village and the railway subgrade there during the rainy season. Ren Xu, the village chief of Yangjiabao village, and the cadre Hua Min (former pseudo-Luzhang) attempted to profit from this, and regardless of the opposition from the masses, reported to the county, saying, "The villagers are unwilling to dig the canal because they don't have enough grain to do so." The county Water Bureau did not investigate the reasons for the masses' opposition to the canal, but instead listened to the village cadres' reports. When the Water Bureau made the 1950 water conservancy project plan in December last year, it sent Li Jinbao to survey the canal. He did not conduct an on-site survey, but only listened to the village cadres such as Hua Min saying, "With grain, we can dig, and at least 800 mu of land can be irrigated." He then went back and reported to the county Water Bureau. Based on Li Jinbao's report, the county Water Bureau blindly decided to include the project in the plan and reported it to the Yanbei Special Prefecture for a loan of grain. The Special Prefecture did not conduct a detailed study of this unrealistic plan, and hastily approved the issuance of a water conservancy loan of 2,250 jin of millet. In March of this year, the county Water Bureau sent Li Jinbao and "expert" Zhu Wancheng to survey again and plan the start of construction. They still did not conduct an on-site survey, but only listened to Hua Min and several main village cadres saying, "We guarantee that the downstream of the new canal will not wash away the farmland and railway subgrade in Liulin village." They immediately appointed Hua Min as the water conservancy director of the canal, and then turned around and reported what the village cadres said to the county Water Bureau. The county government immediately instructed the District 9 government to send people to lead the start of construction. District 9 sent industry assistant Du Linchang to lead. On the first day of construction, the cadres of Liulin village and the Liulin Engineering Section of the Railway Bureau questioned, "What if there is a flood and the farmland and roadbed are washed away?" Du Linchang said sternly, "It will never be damaged." After the start of construction, the masses of Yangjiabao were extremely dissatisfied and expressed their opposition. The village cadres used coercive methods: all laborers had to work. And they arbitrarily stipulated: pre-land reform poor peasant components were paid two jin of rice per worker, middle peasants one jin of rice per worker, and rich middle peasants, rich peasants, and landlords were not paid for their work. Hua Min and six or seven other village cadres took two and a half jin of rice every day, whether they worked or not. Hua Min's nephew, Hua Jinyuan, only worked two shifts and got ten jin of rice. Because the masses in the village had no confidence in digging this canal, they were forced to work by the village cadres, and the distribution of wages in rice was extremely unreasonable, so they were all passive in their work. It was originally planned that 500 workers would be enough to complete the project, but as a result, 1,800 workers were used. Four days after the start of construction, Qian Feng, the director of the county Water Bureau, went to inspect the opening of the new canal and was surrounded by several village cadres. He also did not know about the above problems. After the completion of the canal, the actual inspection showed that: small amounts of water seeped into the sand and could not irrigate the land; when the water was strong, because there was no drainage canal downstream of the canal, it was very easy to wash away the houses, land, and railway subgrade in Liulin village. Now the relevant departments of the railway have repeatedly asked the county People's Government to "urge the change of the river course"; the masses of Liulin village have also filed many complaints with the cadres of Yangjiabao. On May 20, Liu Zhengguo, secretary of the Yanggao County Party Committee, and Wang Chunshan, director of the Industry Department, went to inspect the canal. On the 25th, the county government ordered the District 9 government to block the mouth of the new canal and let the water flow back to the old course.
                                              Qiao Lin, Jia Rui
      Editor's Note: The situation reflected in the letters from Qiao Lin and Jia Rui shows that the Yanbei Special Prefecture and the Yanggao County government lacked investigation and research on the water conservancy problems in Yangjiabao, and made blind plans and decisions, resulting in a great waste of manpower and material resources. The Yanbei Special Prefecture and the Yanggao County government should give appropriate punishment to these cadres who are corrupt and negligent.

### 阳高县水利局工作不深入  盲目开渠造成很大浪费

　　阳高县水利局工作不深入
    盲目开渠造成很大浪费编辑同志：
    察哈尔阳高县九区杨家堡村东面，于四月下旬开了一道渠。历时半月，全渠修成。计用人工一千八百个，贷粮二千二百五十斤。后经检查该渠不能使用，造成人力财力的浪费。原因是该县人民政府存在严重的官僚主义，以及雁北专署在工作上有粗枝大叶的作风。该地北起猪窝沟村，南至杨家堡原有一道沙河，由杨家堡村东南、柳林村西北斜行注入柳林大河。该河在下暴雨时才流水，此外则长年涸竭。去年四月，县政府实业科员冯焕没有经过周密考虑，盲目倡议从猪窝沟村南三里处堵死河道，另辟一条里半长的新渠，企图引水注入一道土质壕沟，使杨家堡村的一部分旱田变成水田。这一计划当时即遭到群众的反对，他们说：“这水十年九不遇，修了渠也是白费人力财力。”如果再堵死原来这一道河的河道，引水注入新渠，新渠下游又无泄水渠，在雨季就会冲毁柳林村的三百亩田地和该处的铁路路基。杨家堡村村长任绪和干部滑民（前伪闾长）企图从中取利，竟不顾群众的反对，便向县里反映说：“老乡不愿开渠，是因为没粮开不起。”县水利局对群众反对开渠的原因未经调查研究，即听信村干部的反映。去年十二月水利局作一九五○水利工程计划时，派李进宝前去勘查渠道。他没到现场进行勘查，只听了滑民等村干部说：“有粮就能开，开成最少也能浇八百亩地。”即回去向县水利局汇报。县水利局根据李进宝的汇报，即盲目决定把该项工程列入计划，并报请雁北专署贷粮。专署对这一脱离实际的计划也没有进行精细研究，就草率的批准发给水利贷粮二千二百五十斤小米。今年三月县水利局又派李进宝率同“专家”朱万成再次前往勘查并筹划开工事宜。他们仍未到现场勘查，只听了滑民和几个主要村干部的话：“保证新渠下流不会冲毁柳林村的田地和铁路路基。”当即任命滑民为该渠水利主任，就转身回县，将村干部所说的话向县水利局报告。县政府马上指令九区政府派人领导开工。九区派实业助理杜林昌去领导。开工的第一天，柳林村的干部和铁路局柳林工务段即提出质问：“如果洪水暴发，冲毁了田地和路基怎么办？”杜林昌声色俱厉的说：“保险坏不了。”开工后，杨家堡群众极不满意，表示反对。村干部就用强制的办法：凡有劳力的一律出工。并擅自规定：土地改革前的贫农成份每人出一个工给二斤米，中农一个工给一斤米，富裕中农、富农、地主出工不给米。滑民等六、七个村干部出工不出工，每天都拿二斤半米。滑民的侄子滑金元只出了两个工就得米十斤。因为该村群众对开这道渠毫无信心，在村干部的强制下动工，加以发给工资米的极端不合理，所以都消极怠工。原计划用五百个人工即可完工，结果用了一千八百个工。开工四天后，县水利局长钱峰曾到新渠道开口处去检查，为若干村干部所包围。他对以上问题亦不知道。该渠修成以后，经实际检查的结果是：小水渗入沙里不能浇地；水势大时，因渠下流没有泄水渠，极易冲毁柳林村的房屋、土地和铁路路基。现在铁路有关部门已数次向县人民政府提出“督促改变河道”；柳林村群众亦向杨家堡干部提出多次控告。五月二十日阳高县委书记刘正国、实业科长王春山亲去该渠检查。县府于二十五日令九区政府堵死新渠口，使水流仍归旧道。
                                              乔林、嘉瑞
      编者按：乔林、嘉瑞来信所反映的情形，说明雁北专署及阳高县政府对杨家堡的水利问题，缺乏调查研究，盲目计划，盲目决定，结果造成了人力物力很大的浪费，雁北专署与阳高县府对这些贪污渎职的干部，应分别加以适当的处分。
