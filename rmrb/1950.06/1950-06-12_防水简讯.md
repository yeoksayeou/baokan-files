    Ensure Smooth Railway Traffic During the Rainy Season
    Ministry of Railways Issues Instructions to Strengthen Waterproofing
    In order to prevent flood damage and ensure the smooth passage of all railway lines during the rainy season, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government recently issued an order calling on railway workers and staff across the country to quickly carry out waterproofing work. The order requires all bureaus and engineering sections to establish specialized waterproofing organizations and inspection teams, to prepare all waterproofing materials and tools before the end of May and transport them to the nearest locations where flood damage may occur; to prepare standby flood control trains in areas where severe flood damage is expected; to complete the repair of main bridges before the rainy season, to clear blockages in bridge culverts, and to pay attention to roadbed drainage and other facilities. After the order was issued, the ministry convened a waterproofing symposium for railway bureaus on May 22 to listen to and inspect the waterproofing plans and work of each bureau. After the meeting, the ministry sent five groups to inspect waterproofing work across the country.
    Pukou River Dredging and Embankment Protection Project Mostly Completed
    The Pukou Wharf repair project in Nanjing, its bank protection project has been fully completed, and the river dredging project has also been nearly half completed. Pukou Wharf is Nanjing's main wharf and an important hub for water and land transportation between the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and both the north and south banks, where the Jinpu and Huning railways are connected by ferry. With the intense work of nearly 10,000 people for more than three months, by May 20, the 2,600-meter-long Pukou Wharf bank protection project was successfully completed according to plan. The dredging project is scheduled to excavate 6 million cubic meters of earth, and more than 2.64 million cubic meters have been completed. More than one-third of Baisha Island has been excavated. The dredging project is now being stepped up.
    The Jiang, River, and Zhou embankment repair project, which protects 160,000 mu of farmland in the suburbs of Nanjing, has been fully completed after the efforts of more than 63,000 people for three and a half months. A total of 1,294,400 cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. The Jiang, Zhou, and River embankments along the Yangtze River and various islands in the river in the suburbs of Nanjing are 372 li long. The completion of this embankment repair project not only ensures that 160,000 mu of farmland in the suburbs of Nanjing is not affected by floods, but also enables 280,000 mu of farmland to benefit from irrigation by using culverts and channels.
    Minjiang River Mountain Flood Outbreak - Government Allocates Grain for Emergency Relief
    In the last ten days of last month, mountain floods broke out in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River, causing the low-lying fields on both sides of the lower reaches of the Minjiang River to be 5 to 6 feet deep, and the water in the streets along the river in the urban area to be waist-deep. The flood gradually receded on the 30th. Before this mountain flood broke out, because preparations had been made in advance, the houses of people and animals in the suburbs of Fuzhou and Minhou were not damaged after the flood arrived. Now the Fuzhou Suburban Production Relief Association has allocated grain and firewood for emergency relief. The People's Government will soon provide loans for grain seeds to help farmers sow late rice in the early rice fields that have been flooded for too long.
    Jiyun River Breaches in Baodi - Local People Make Every Effort to Rescue
    On May 27, the water level of the Jiyun River rose sharply, and a breach occurred at Maguozhuang in Baodi County, with the water flowing towards Dazhongzhuangwa (a depression where water had not yet dried up). According to the statistics of one district in the county alone, more than 2,000 mu of wheat fields have been flooded. Due to the excessive water, the embankments downstream overflowed in many places, making it impossible to prevent. In order to prevent the flooded area from expanding, the county government immediately took emergency measures, in addition to wrapping the two embankment heads at the breach to prevent the mouth from expanding, it immediately stopped the dike restoration project in that section and concentrated 3,000 laborers to fully protect the Xinlin (Xinan Town to Lintingkou) highway, protecting the wheat and large fields in the 12th and 13th districts of the county.

    On May 27, the Zhanghe River in Weixian County, Hebei Province, surged, causing flooding and submerging part of the wheat fields. After the flood occurred, the county people's government immediately took emergency measures, notifying the districts along the river and the ChunGong Committee to mobilize the masses to block the breaches, drain water, and harvest wheat. Cadres and the masses of the Sixth District of the county blocked five breaches of the river embankment, 55 zhang long in one day, and rescued more than 5,000 mu of wheat.

    卫护南京郊区十六万亩农田的江、河、洲堤培修工程，经六万三千余人历三个半月的努力，现已全部竣工。共计完成土方一百二十九万四千余公方。宁市郊区沿江和江心各洲的江、洲、河堤长达三百七十二华里。这次修堤工程完工后，不仅保障了南京郊区十六万亩农田不受水患，并且可以使二十八万亩农田能利用涵闸、通渠，得到灌溉之利。
    闽江山洪暴发  政府拨粮急赈
    上月下旬，闽江上游山洪暴发，致使闽江下游两岸低洼田地水深五、六尺，市区沿江各街水深及腰，三十日洪水渐降。在此次山洪暴发前，因为预有准备，故洪水到来后，福州市郊及闽侯等地人畜房舍均无伤损。现福州市郊生产救济会已拨下粮食、柴草，作急赈用。对被淹时间过长的早稻田，人民政府即将贷放种粮，帮助农民播种晚稻。
