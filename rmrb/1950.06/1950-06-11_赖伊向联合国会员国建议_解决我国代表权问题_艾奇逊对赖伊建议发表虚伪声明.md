　　Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, starting in late April, successively met with the leaders of the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to conduct activities aimed at resolving the current stalemate in the United Nations. On June 6th, Lie sent a letter to the 59 member states of the United Nations, suggesting a solution to the problem of China's representation in the United Nations. In the letter, Lie stated: "If the member states of the United Nations still have serious differences of opinion regarding the issue of the representation of China, a permanent member of the Security Council, then it will not be possible to make significant progress on other issues. Resolving the issue of China's representation is necessary." At a press conference on the 8th, Lie stated that the main problem facing the United Nations is that 475 million Chinese people must immediately obtain representation in international organizations. In response to reporters' questions, Lie said that he believed the China issue "must" be resolved by the second half of July, because the UN Charter stipulates that the Security Council must take action on certain issues 60 days before the UN General Assembly convenes on September 19th, so the final deadline for the decision is July 19th.

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: US Secretary of State Acheson issued a hypocritical statement on the 7th regarding the proposal by UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie to resolve the issue of China's representation in the United Nations. Acheson disguised his conspiracy to prevent the representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, who truly represent the Chinese people, from attending various meetings of the United Nations by saying that the United States would "accept the decisions taken by the necessary majority in any United Nations body." Because everyone knows that it is none other than Truman, Acheson, and their ilk of American imperialist elements who manipulate the "majority vote" in the United Nations; it is they who stubbornly keep the political zombie of the Kuomintang in the United Nations; therefore, it is they who have caused the current paralysis of the United Nations.

　　赖伊向联合国会员国建议
    解决我国代表权问题
    艾奇逊对赖伊建议发表虚伪声明
    【新华社十日讯】联合国秘书长赖伊，于四月下旬开始，曾先后与美、英、法、苏四国政府领袖会晤，进行企图解决联合国目前僵局的活动。六月六日，赖伊向联合国五十九个会员国发出公函，建议解决中国在联合国的代表权问题。赖伊在公函里说：“如果联合国的会员国对于安全理事会的一个常任理事国——中国的代表权问题仍然存在着严重分歧意见的话，那末，在其他问题上也不可能得到重大进展。解决中国代表权的问题是必要的。”赖伊在八日的记者招待会上表示，联合国面临的主要问题，是四万万七千五百万中国人民立刻要在国际组织中取得代表权的问题。赖伊在回答记者询问时说：他认为中国问题“必须”解决的日期是七月下半月，因为联合国章程规定安理会对于某些问题采取行动，必须在联合国大会于九月十九日举行会议之前六十日，因此，决定的最后期限便是七月十九日。
    【新华社十日讯】美国国务卿艾奇逊，对联合国秘书长赖伊所提出的解决中国在联合国的代表权问题，于七日发表了虚伪的声明。艾奇逊以美国将“接受联合国任何机构中必要的多数所采取的决定”，来掩饰其阴谋，即阻止真正代表中国人民的中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表出席联合国的各种会议。因为尽人皆知，操纵联合国的“多数票”的不是别人，正是杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流的美国帝国主义分子；死死把国民党政治僵尸安在联合国中的也正是他们；因此，使联合国目前陷于瘫痪状态的也就是他们。
