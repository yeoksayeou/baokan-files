Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: TASS reported on May 30th: The newspaper "Izvestia" published the last section of Professor Popov's article entitled "The United States Colonizes Japan." The author first pointed out Japan's dependence on the United States, and the resulting deterioration. The cultivated area of ​​Japanese agriculture has decreased from an average of 3.2 million hectares in 1936-40 to 2.9 million hectares in 1950. While the level of general industrial production is very low, the production of certain departments of war importance has greatly increased. The purpose of the US occupation authorities in encouraging the development of Japanese military industry is to turn Japan into a US military bridgehead in the Far East. The civilian-serving sectors of Japanese industry have suffered a general crisis, primarily the textile and food industries. The Japanese cotton textile industry is directly dependent on the United States. Japan is one of the largest consumers of American cotton. American entrepreneurs also exploit the labor of Japanese workers with meager wages and obtain huge profits from the export of Japanese cotton textiles. The United States not only profits from Japan's exports, but also profits by selling American goods at high prices. For example, the price of the best Japanese coal is $15 per ton, Chinese coal is $11, but American coal delivered to the Japanese coast is $23. American entrepreneurs also take advantage of the Japanese famine to import large quantities of grain to rake in unreasonable profits. American goods are dumped in Japan, while very few Japanese goods are imported into the United States. The United States artificially tailors Japanese trade to the interests of American monopoly capitalists. This creates a huge trade deficit for Japan. From September 1945 to the beginning of this year, the above-mentioned deficit has reached more than 1.3 billion US dollars. This huge gap ties Japan to the double harness of American imperialism.

The author further pointed out that US measures are implemented under the guise of Japan's "economic stability." These measures violate the decisions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945, pursuing the same goals as the Marshall Plan in Europe. The implementation of these measures has further deteriorated Japan's economic situation and aggravated the poverty and suffering of the working masses. At the beginning of 1950, there were approximately 13 million unemployed people in Japan.

The author finally pointed out that the Japanese working people, led by the Communist Party, have risen to resist the policy of US imperialists to colonize Japan and the traitorous Japanese ruling clique. The organizational strength of the working class and peasants has risen to an unprecedented level. Currently, the trade unions unite 7.5 million factory and office workers. Progressive peasant organizations have grown up and gained strength. It is impossible for US imperialists to turn the history of Japan back to the dark days of the fascist militarist police regime.

### 美帝使日本殖民地化  鼓励军火生产恶化了经济情况

　　美帝使日本殖民地化
    鼓励军火生产恶化了经济情况 
    日失业者本年初已达千三百万
    消息报续载波波夫专文末节
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社五月三十日讯：消息报刊载了波波夫教授所著以“美国使日本殖民地化”为题的专文的最后一节。作者首先指出了日本对美国的依赖，以及因此而发生的恶化。日本农业的耕种面积，已从一九三六——四○年的平均面积三百二十万公顷，降低至一九五○年的二百九十万公顷。在一般工业生产的水平都很低的时候，某些具有战争重要性部门的生产，却有极大的增加。美国占领当局鼓励日本军事工业发展的目的，在于把日本变为美国在远东的军事桥头堡。日本工业中服务于平民的部门，已遭到了总危机，其中首先是纺织工业和食品工业。日本棉织品工业已直接依赖于美国。日本是美棉的最大消费者之一。美国企业家还剥削工资微小的日本工人的劳动，从日本棉织品的输出上获得巨额利润。美国不仅从日本的出口方面获得利润，并靠着把美国货高价出售获利。例如，最好的日本煤价格是每吨十五美元，中国煤十一美元，但运交到日本海岸的美国煤却是二十三美元。美国企业家并趁着日本的饥荒，输入大量粮食来搜刮不近情理的利润。美国货在日本倾销，日本货则很少输入美国。美国人为地使日本贸易适应于美国垄断资本家的利益。这使日本的贸易平衡产生巨大的逆差。从一九四五年九月到今年初，上述逆差已达十三亿美元以上。这个巨大的差额把日本系在美国帝国主义的双轮马车上。
    作者进一步指出：美国的措施是在日本的“经济稳定”的伪装下实行的。这些措施违犯了一九四五年十二月莫斯科外长会议的决定，追求着马歇尔计划在欧洲所追求的同样的目标。这些措施的实行，进一步地恶化了日本的经济情况，加剧了劳苦大众的贫穷和痛苦。在一九五○年初，日本已约有一千三百万人失业。
    作者最后指出：由共产党领导的日本劳动人民，已起来反抗美帝国主义者将日本殖民地化的政策和卖国的日本统治集团。工人阶级和农民的组织力量，是空前未有地高涨。目前，各工会团结了七百五十万工厂和机关的职工。进步的农民组织已成长起来，并已获得力量。美帝国主义者不可能把日本的历史，转到法西斯军国主义者警察政权的黑暗日子里去。
