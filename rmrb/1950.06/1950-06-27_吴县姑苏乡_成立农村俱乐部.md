　　Wuxian County, Gusu Township
    Establishes Rural Club
    [Suzhou News from this newspaper] Gusu Township, a key township in the Mudu District of Wuxian County, Southern Jiangsu Province, has established a rural club under the guidance of the county education section, due to the increasing political awareness of the peasants and their urgent demand for proper cultural and recreational activities. The club is led by a specially established committee (reorganized from the winter school committee), which includes 17 members consisting of peasant association cadres, township administrative cadres, primary school teachers, Youth League members, and work team cadres. The club is divided into four sections: cultural and educational (responsible for running people's education classes, learning mutual aid groups, reading groups, blackboard newspapers, reading rooms, and mobile libraries, etc.), entertainment (responsible for leading theater troupes, singing teams, children's singing teams, etc.), production (responsible for leading silkworm breeding groups, mountain reclamation groups, embroidery groups, fishing groups, and grass shoe and grass bag making groups), and general affairs (responsible for managing miscellaneous affairs, providing writing services, public health, and mass meeting halls, etc.). The club's funding is solved by voluntary donations from the masses and sideline production.
    The people's education classes run by the club adopt the methods of "production teaching" and "itinerant teaching" to guide peasants in learning, and have achieved good results. Production teaching is conducted by using the farmers' rest time in the fields to teach in a conversational way, explaining rice stem borer control, fertilization, etc.; sometimes newspapers are also read. Itinerant teaching is to divide the students into groups according to natural villages, with primary school teachers and club cadres taking turns teaching in each village every evening, and using little teachers (fifth and sixth grade primary school students) to help the peasants learn to read.

　　吴县姑苏乡
    成立农村俱乐部
    【本报苏州讯】苏南区吴县木渎区的一个重点乡——姑苏乡，由于农民群众政治觉悟提高，迫切要求正当的文化娱乐活动，在县教育科派员指导下，成立了农村俱乐部。俱乐部由专设的委员会（由冬学委员改组的）领导，委员中包括农会干部、乡行政干部、小学教师、青年团员、工作队干部等十七人。俱乐部下分设文教（负责办民教班、学习互助组、读报组、黑板报、阅览室及流动图书室等）、娱乐（负责领导剧团、歌咏队、儿童歌咏团等）、生产（负责领导蚕桑组、开山组、刺绣组、捕鱼组、制草鞋草包组）、总务（负责管理杂务、办代笔问事、大众卫生、及群众会堂等）等四股。俱乐部的经费由群众自愿捐助并由副业生产来解决。
    俱乐部所办的民教班，采取“生产教学”、“巡回教学”的方法，领导农民学习，获得了很好的成绩。生产教学是利用农民在田里生产休息时间，以漫谈方式进行教学，讲解治螟、施肥等；有时还读报。巡回教学是把学员按自然村分编小组，由小学教师与俱乐部干部在每天傍晚到各村轮流教学，并利用小先生（五六年级小学生）来帮助农民识字。
