　　The Inventors of the Trolley Company
　　Lu Yuntai
　　Lu Yuntai, the creator of the trolley's splash guard, has been working at the trolley company's repair shop for nearly thirty years. He is skilled in his craft and friendly, and everyone calls him Old Lu. Before liberation, he was a deputy foreman in the factory, but he didn't actually manage anything; he always had to take orders. As a result, his work was also sloppy. In the early days of liberation, Old Lu was still the same. He said, "I don't care about the Communist Party or the Kuomintang, I just want to work, eat, and not make trouble." In March of last year, the municipal government held a workers' symposium. The cordial care of the leaders present moved this old worker. He began to feel that he was truly a master today and became more active in his work. The administration saw that the riveting team had no leader and asked him to work during the day as the foreman of the riveting team. Although the deputy foreman was demoted to foreman in name, his responsibilities increased, but he was even happier. He patiently discussed matters with his workmates, and the whole team worked together to research and improve production.
　　Trolleys being vulnerable to rain has been an unresolved problem for over twenty years. Last August, a heavy rain destroyed more than thirty locomotives. From that time on, the trolley company's Party, government, labor union, and Youth League called on employees to find ways to waterproof the trolleys. At the first waterproofing meeting in February, the reasons why trolleys are vulnerable to rain were studied: 1. The resistor is installed under the car, and water stored on the track is splashed onto the resistor by the wheels, causing the resistor to short-circuit and burn out. 2. The lowest part of the motor skin has a hole close to the ground, which also easily allows water to enter, causing the roller coil to get wet and burn out. Everyone racked their brains for this matter. Someone suggested adding rubber pads behind the rollers and using iron plates to block them from behind to waterproof them. Lu Yuntai put even more effort into this matter. He initially tried using iron sheets to block the resistor, but after testing, it failed because it was not ventilated and the resistor generated heat. He also studied installing mudguards next to the wheels, using seven-and-a-half-millimeter iron sheets chopped into eight-and-a-half-inch wide and eighteen-and-a-half-inch long iron plates, with rubber attached below, to completely block the mud and water brought up by the wheels. This solved the problem of driving in rainy weather, reduced the damage rate of driving in rainy weather, and provided convenience for citizens to ride in rainy weather. This rationalization proposal received first prize. In addition, he improved four tools, all of which won fourth prize: (1) Adding impact-absorbing bumpers to the locomotive's front, reducing damage to the car. (2) When carpenters overhaul the cars, they used to use manpower and ropes to lower the car roofs, which was not only laborious but also dangerous. He studied using pulleys, which reduced manpower and increased safety. (3) Carpenters used to chisel round holes in the electric cylinder wooden seats, and it took thirty minutes to manually make one hole. He designed and manufactured a sliding drill, which only takes three minutes to make one round hole. (4) The cotter pins used by riveters to rivet the car skin were easily bent, and the lead screws were also easily damaged. He used waste materials to make short cotter pin lead screws and widened the cotter pin iron, which improved the cotter pin's effectiveness and made it less likely to bend.

　　Liu Mengxing
　　Liu Mengxing, who constantly improves tools to increase production efficiency at the trolley company, became an apprentice at the factory at the age of fifteen and wandered around outside after completing his apprenticeship. He believed that he could eat anywhere with his skills. He has left his mark on various factories in North China, the Taiyuan, Kailuan, and Mentougou coal mines. He has been to the trolley company four times before and after.
　　After liberation, he felt that the times had changed and also felt the pain of his past wanderings. He settled down to work at the trolley repair shop. Originally, the factory had a contract work system, which was a way for workers in the past to earn more money by contracting out some work outside of working hours because their wages were too low. After liberation, he believed that workers had become masters of their own house and should no longer do this. Therefore, he took the lead in giving up contract work and volunteered to work overtime when necessary. Liu Mengxing also constantly thought of ways to improve production. At that time, there was a shortage of insulating boards for the automatic brake boxes on the trolleys, and there were no foreign goods available. The factory made them with brittle slate. He studied using asbestos paper and also studied using asbestos ash. Finally, he cooperated with other workers and successfully experimented.
　　After studying at the cadre training class, Liu Mengxing joined the Party, recognized that he had to serve the people, and became even more active in production. This year, after everyone divided up the work and set plans, work efficiency has greatly improved. He has racked his brains even more and improved many tools. In the past, the trolley company used to saw the copper heads of electric cylinder brushes by hand, and each worker could make 150 per shift. He made a set of semicircular hole cutters, which can make more than 100 per hour. To make the hexagonal caps of the iron screws for the electric cylinder brushes, they used to be filed by hand, and 60 could be filed each day. Later, he studied using a pressure die to make them, which could produce 60 per hour and were more regular than those filed by hand. Recently, he and Zhang Yubo made copper head pieces. Initially, they were picked by hand and then filed, and 15 pieces could be filed per hour. Liu Mengxing studied using pneumatic shears to cut them, which can cut 40 pieces per hour. Because the pneumatic shears are powerful, they often cut the pieces out of shape, and it is also very laborious to hold them with pliers. He and Zhang Yubo jointly studied ways to improve the method and plan to make another die. After the experiment is successful, 240 pieces can be cut per hour.
　　These achievements have greatly encouraged the workers in the filing team and have become the direction of everyone's future efforts. This time, the company awarded him first or second prize for each of his contributions.

　　电车公司的创造发明者
    卢运泰
    创造电车挡水板的卢运泰，在电车公司修造厂工作快三十年了。他技术熟练，待人和气，大伙都叫他老卢头。解放前他在厂子里当副工头，实际上不管事，老得听喝。所以他干起活来也是马马糊糊。解放初期，老卢头还是那样。他说：“什么共产党、国民党，咱全不管，反正是干活吃饭不多事。”去年三月间，市府召开了一次工人座谈会，与会首长对工人们的亲切关怀，感动了这位老工人。他开始感觉今天真当了主人，工作积极起来了。行政上看到铆工班没有领导，就叫他到白天工作，当铆工班的领班。副工头改领班，名义上降级了，但责任加重了，他反到更高兴了。他有事耐心和工友商量，全班打成一片，共同研究改进生产。
    电车怕雨，是二十多年来都没有解决的问题。去年八月一场大雨毁了三十多辆机车。由那时起，电车公司党政工团号召职工想法防水。二月的第一次防水会上，研究出电车怕雨的原因：一、阻力装在车下，轨道上存水被车轮带起溅到阻力上，使阻力短连而烧坏。二、马达皮的最下面有一个洞接近地面，也容易进水，使滚子线圈受潮烧坏。大家都为此事开动了脑筋。有人提议滚子后加设胶皮垫，后面用铁板挡着防水。卢运泰为这事更费了心血。他最初试用铁皮把阻力挡着，但试行后，因不通风，阻力生热而失败。他又研究在车轮旁装设挡泥板，用七厘五的铁皮剁成八英寸半宽十八英寸半长的铁板，下面接上胶皮，整个挡住车轮所带起的泥和水。这样解决了雨天行车的问题，减少了雨天行车的损坏率，并给市民在雨天乘车以便利。这个合理化建议，得到了一等奖。另外他还改善了四种工具，都得了四等奖：（一）机车头增设缓冲的碰木护铁，减少了车的损坏。（二）木工大修车时，拆车顶子，原来用人力加绳子系下，不但费劲也太危险。他研究用滑轮，减少了人力，增加了安全性。（三）木工凿电缸木座圆眼，原用人力一个眼需三十分钟，他设计制出滑钻，一个圆眼只用三分钟。（四）铆工铆车皮用的卡蓝易弯，丝杠也易坏，他用废料制短卡子丝扣，并加宽卡子铁，使卡蓝效力提高，不易弯了。

    刘梦星
    电车公司不断改良工具提高生产效率的刘梦星，十五岁就到工厂学徒，期满后在外边流荡。他认为凭技术到那里也能吃饭，华北各工厂，太原、开滦、门头沟各煤矿，都有过他的足迹。电车公司先后来过四次。
    解放了，他感到时代变了，同时也感到过去奔走的痛苦。他安下心来在电车修造厂工作。原来厂里有包活制度，是过去工人因为工资太低，把些活放在工作时间外包件，可以多挣些钱。解放后，他认为工人当家做了主人，不应再这样作。于是他首先放弃包活，有必要时义务加班。刘梦星并时刻在生产上想办法。当时电车上自动闸盒的隔电板缺乏，外洋货也没有，厂里用石板做的性脆，他研究用石棉纸做，又研究用石棉灰作。终于和别的工友合作试验成功。
    刘梦星在干训班学习后，加入了自己的党，认清了要为人民服务，在生产上就更加积极了。今年各人分工订计划后，工作效力都提高了很多。他更开动脑筋，改良了很多工具。过去，电车公司做电缸大刷子铜头都是用人工锯，每工可做一百五十个。他做了一套半圆窟窿的剪子口，每小时就能做一百多个。做电缸大刷子铁螺丝六方帽，以前用手锉，每天锉六十个。后来他研究用压力焖子作，每小时就能出六十个，比手锉的更规矩。最近和张玉波做铜头片，最初用人工剔，然后锉，每小时锉十五片。刘梦星研究用汽剪子铰，每小时能铰四十片。因汽剪子力大，时常铰走了样子，而且用钳子挟着很费力。他和张玉波共同研究改善办法，计划再做一个焖子。试验成功后，每小时可铰二百四十片。
    这些成绩给了案工班工人很大的鼓舞，成为大家今后努力的方向。这次公司对他的每一种供献都给了一等奖或二等奖。
