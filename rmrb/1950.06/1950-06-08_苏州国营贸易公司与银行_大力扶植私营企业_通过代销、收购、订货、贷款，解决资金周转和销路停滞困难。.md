　　Suzhou State-Owned Trading Company and Banks
    Vigorously Support Private Enterprises
    By Providing Solutions to Difficulties in Capital Turnover and Stagnant Sales Through Consignment Sales, Acquisitions, Orders, and Loans.
    [Report from this Newspaper] According to the Xin Suzhou Bao (New Suzhou Daily) news: The Suzhou Municipal State-Owned Trading Company and the People's Bank of China are supporting private industrial and commercial enterprises to solve difficulties such as capital turnover, raw material shortages, and sluggish sales through methods such as processing, consignment sales, acquisitions, orders, and loans.
    In addition to entrusting private manufacturers such as Youlian, Hengyuan, and Gongmao to sell more than 1.4 million catties of rice and over 7,600 bags of flour in March and April, the Suzhou branch of the China National Cereals Corporation has, since May, entrusted the private Zhenda Rice Mill to process more than 1,022,000 catties of indica rice, and the Yong'an Rice Mill to process more than 1,251,000 catties of indica rice. The Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company supports private textile manufacturers through methods such as contract spinning and weaving and temporary acquisitions, having acquired more than 30,000 bales of cotton yarn from January to the end of April. For example, in April, to help the private Yuankang Yarn Factory solve its capital turnover difficulties, the company acquired 100 bales of cotton yarn from the factory. To address the difficulty of sluggish sales of finished products from private knitting, chemical, and other factories, the Department Store, even during the preparatory period for its official opening, acquired 1,000 cases of soap from Yuhua Factory, and a total of more than 260 dozens of socks, towels, and undershirts from Xinguang, Yude, Dakang Shifuhua, Hongji, and other factories, worth 30 million yuan, which partially helped these factories solve their capital turnover difficulties.
    The outstanding balance of loans issued by the Suzhou branch of the People's Bank of China to support private industry has been increasing month by month, from 532,442,850 yuan at the end of February to 645,405,1467 yuan at the end of March, and reaching 936,861,600 yuan by May 13. In addition, at the end of last year, the bank lent 128 pieces of "Awakening Lion" yarn to the private Litai Weaving Factory through the method of ordering, and in January of this year, it ordered 150 pieces of "Daguan" yarn and 50 pieces of "Hongli" yarn from the Cotton Textile Industry Joint Management Office to help them overcome capital turnover difficulties. In mid-March, it also granted Suzhou Silk Factory overdrafts and collateral loans of 150 million yuan, and Suzhou Yarn Factory an overdraft of 100 million yuan. Furthermore, Dongwu Silk Factory was granted a rollover of loan interest payments equivalent to 5,900 real units. Last year, the bank also organized private banks to pool funds for production lending to the cotton spinning and flour industries' joint management office in Suzhou. In late April of this year, it guided private banks to formally establish the Suzhou Banking Industry Joint Lending Office, guiding private funds to legitimate industrial and commercial businesses. For example, on May 18, the Joint Lending Office signed a regular pledge loan contract with the Sulun Textile and Dyeing Factory, initially lending the factory 350 million yuan, solving Sulun's difficulty in lacking funds to purchase raw materials.
