    Workers Voluntarily Reduce Salaries and Economize to Overcome Difficulties and Continue Production
    [Our Newspaper] Since the stabilization of prices, the flour produced by the Xinzhong Flour Mill, a publicly operated enterprise under the Beijing Industrial Bureau, has experienced temporary sluggish sales, resulting in consecutive losses in April and May. In order to maintain the factory's continued production, at the workers' meeting on the 8th of this month, workers Wang Jianping and five others voluntarily proposed a salary reduction. After the meeting, accountant Liu Zhenhua and storekeeper Jiang Zhijun requested the factory to reduce their salaries even further, sincerely stating: "For the sake of long-term interests, overcoming the current difficulties, even a larger reduction is something we are happy to do!" On the evening of the 9th, all workers' groups held enthusiastic discussions on increasing production and practicing economy. Technicians proposed working one extra hour each day and decided to reduce the original twenty-nine lights in the machine room by half, or replace the large bulbs with smaller ones, without hindering work. Technicians Wang Fu and the cook also requested a salary reduction and the cancellation of the coal-saving bonus, but the factory politely declined, considering their family lives and work morale. At the group meeting, young technician Li Dianhe proposed: "As long as there is time, I guarantee to do the factory's scattered carpentry work without any compensation." Wang Binggeng also proposed: "I will take on any ironwork that I can do." Foreman Shi Zhigao stated: "As long as I know how to do it, I will personally provide guidance." Now, the workers are actively taking action. They say with confidence: "As long as everyone is of one mind, our factory will definitely be run well."

    职工自动减薪节约  克服困难继续生产
    【本报讯】北京市工业局所属公营新中面粉厂职工，自动减薪节约，提高生产。物价稳定以来，该厂所产面粉一时呈现滞销现象，四、五两月连续亏空。职工为了保持工厂继续生产，于本月八日职工大会上，职员王建屏等六人自动提出减薪，会计刘振华、保管姜之俊二人，会后更要求厂方多减，他们诚恳地表示：为了永久利益，克服目前困难，即是多减也是高兴的！九日晚，各职工小组热烈讨论了增产节约问题。技工提出每日加班一小时，并决定将机房原有电灯二十九个，在不妨碍工作的原则下，减少一半，或将大灯泡换成小灯泡。技工王福、伙房大师夫也要求减薪和取消节煤奖金，但厂方照顾其家庭生活及工作情绪，婉言谢绝。青年技工李殿河在小组会上提出：厂方零星的木活，只要有时间，自己保证无代价地去做。王丙更也提出：凡是能干的铁活，我打包去干。领班石志高表示：只要我会作的，一定亲身去指导。现在工友已积极行动起来，他们充满信心地说：“只要大家一条心，咱们的工厂一定会搞得好。”
