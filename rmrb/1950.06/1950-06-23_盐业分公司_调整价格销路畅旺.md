　　Salt Branch Company
    Adjusts Prices, Sales Flourish

    [From Our Newspaper] Since the Beijing Direct Branch of the China Salt Industry Company adjusted salt prices on the first of this month, the sales of coarse salt have been brisk. In the first half of the month, the market transaction volume was over 1,000 dan (approximately 50 metric tons), already reaching the total sales volume for the entire month of May. Among farmers in the villages near Beijing, every 100 jin of millet could only be exchanged for 76.57 jin of coarse salt in May, but in early June, it could be exchanged for 116.6 jin. According to statistics from the Beijing Salt Industry Company, the company's salt sales network only covered 17 cities and counties in May, but in the first half of this month, it has expanded to 26 cities and counties.
