　　【Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Fifteenth】 TASS Moscow: At the joint session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet's Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities held on the 13th, Soviet Finance Minister Zverev delivered a report on the Soviet Union's national budget for 1950 and the execution of the national budget for 1948-1949.
    Zverev stated: The revenue of the Soviet national budget increased from 410.5 billion rubles in 1948 to 437 billion rubles in 1949, while expenditures also increased from 370.9 billion rubles to 412.3 billion rubles. Two-thirds of the budget revenue in 1949 came from sales taxes and profit taxes from socialist enterprises. Due to the substantial increase in the profits of the national economy, the income from profit taxes increased by 55 percent compared to 1948. According to the plan, 161.9 billion rubles were allocated in 1949 for the development of the national economy. Expenditures on social and cultural facilities reached 116 billion, defense expenditures were 79.2 billion rubles, and administrative expenses were 13.5 billion rubles.
    Zverev then reported on the national budget for 1950, stating: The budget revenue for 1950 is 432 billion rubles, and the expenditure is 427.9 billion rubles, with a surplus of 4.1 billion rubles. The majority of the budget funds are allocated for the development of the national economy and further improvements in culture and people's welfare. The budget allocates 164.4 billion rubles for national economic expenses and 120.7 billion rubles for social and cultural facility expenses; the total of the two items accounts for about two-thirds of the total budget expenditure. The budget stipulates further expansion of the education and health organization network. Of the total amount of social and cultural facility expenses, 59.5 billion rubles will be used for education, and 22.4 billion will be allocated for social welfare needs. Expenditures under the national social insurance budget will reach 18.1 billion rubles. The cost of developing science will reach 8.1 billion rubles.
    In order to further strengthen the defense capabilities of the socialist motherland, the budget has allocated the necessary funds to maintain the Soviet armed forces, which defend the peaceful labor of the Soviet people. The 1950 budget stipulates that 79.4 billion rubles will be allocated to the Ministry of the Army and the Navy. Defense expenditures account for 18.5 percent of the total budget expenditure. Before the war, in 1940, defense expenditures accounted for 32.6 percent of the total budget; in the first year of the post-war five-year plan, they accounted for 23.9 percent. These figures once again demonstrate that the Soviet Union is unswervingly pursuing a policy of peace, which is fully supported by all progressive mankind.
    Zverev concluded: The 1950 budget has guaranteed the necessary funds for the Soviet Union to further develop its national economy, improve the welfare and culture of the working people, and implement various measures. The Soviet people will mark this new year with new victories.

    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：在十三日举行的苏联最高苏维埃联盟院与民族院联席会议席上，苏联财政部长兹维列夫作了关于苏联一九五○年国家预算，与一九四八——一九四九年国家预算的执行情况的报告。
    兹维列夫称：苏联国家预算的收入自一九四八年的四千一百零五亿卢布增至一九四九年的四千三百七十亿卢布，而支出也自三千七百零九亿卢布增至四千一百二十三亿卢布。一九四九年的预算收入的三分之二系征自社会主义企业的营业税及利得税。由于国民经济利润的大大增加，利得税的收入较一九四八年增加了百分之五十五。依照计划，一九四九年指拨了一千六百十九亿卢布作为发展国民经济的费用。社会及文化设施费用的开支达一千一百六十亿、国防费为七百九十二亿卢布、行政费为一百三十五亿卢布。
    兹维列夫继报告一九五○年的国家预算称：一九五○年预算岁入为四千三百二十亿卢布，岁出为四千二百七十九亿卢布，收支相抵，尚余四十一亿卢布。预算资金的大部拨供发展国民经济与进一步提高文化及增进人民福利之用。预算中指拨一千六百四十四亿卢布为国民经济费用；一千二百零七亿卢布为社会与文化设施费用；两项总计约占预算总支出的三分之二。预算规定进一步扩大教育与卫生机关网。社会与文化设施费用总额中将有五百九十五亿卢布用于教育，有二百二十四亿拨供社会福利事业之需。国家社会保险预算项下的支出将达一百八十一亿卢布。发展科学的费用达八十一亿卢布。
    为了进一步加强社会主义祖国的防御力量，预算指拨了必需的款项，作为维持保卫苏联人民和平劳动的苏联武装部队的经费。一九五○年预算规定拨予陆军部及海军部的款项是七百九十四亿卢布。国防经费在预算的总支出中占百分之一八点五。在战前一九四○年，国防经费占总预算的百分之三十二点六；在战后五年计划第一年，占百分之二十三点九。这些数字再度表明了苏联是坚持不渝地奉行着为一切进步人类所全力拥护的和平政策。
    兹维列夫结语称：一九五○年的预算，已为苏联进一步发展国民经济、增进劳动人民福利与文化的种种措施，保证了需用的基金。苏联人民将以新的胜利标志这新的一年。
