　　Summary of Health Work Inspection in Lin County
    Pingyuan Provincial Health Bureau
    Lin County is a key health county in the Anyang Special District of our province, with a population of 457,805, including 229,573 males and 228,232 females. It has twelve districts and 541 villages. There is a Lin County Normal School, ten senior elementary schools, and 533 junior elementary schools, with 760 primary and secondary school teachers.
    Health Organization: The county has 605 doctors, including 42 Western medicine doctors and 563 traditional Chinese medicine doctors. There are 22 model doctors in the county, 13 in the ten districts, and 11 who have been awarded certificates by the county People's Government. The organizational system is as follows: the County Health and Epidemic Prevention Committee leads the district Medical Research Association, the district Medical Research Association leads the joint ward doctor teams, and the joint ward doctor teams lead the village health committees. The county has a total of 12,400 health teams. The responsible persons of all the above associations are democratically elected, and the connection between the associations is very close. If an infectious disease occurs in a certain area, they report and transmit it upwards according to the organizational system, all the way to the district. In addition to reporting the situation to the County Health and Epidemic Prevention Committee, the district immediately organizes the local doctors into a "shock treatment team," which is then divided into smaller teams to carry out suppression and treatment.
    Health slogans are posted in every village, such as: "Pay attention to hygiene and prevent disease," "See a doctor when you are sick," "Don't engage in superstitious nonsense like praying to gods and Buddha," "Don't drink raw water, there are microorganisms in the water, drinking it can easily cause illness," and so on.
    Every ten households on the streets and alleys hang a "Hygiene Boundary Sign," "Hygiene Team Leader Sign," and "Cleaning Duty Sign." It is stipulated that there should be a major cleaning every three days and a cleaning of the courtyard every day. The team leader and inspection and publicity committee member check and summarize in a timely manner, and announce the good and bad teams and family hygiene on the radio station. Every family is required to bring boiled water when working in the fields, not to wear dirty clothes on a daily basis, and to frequently sun their bedding. It is also necessary to summarize and create the experience of model families. Half of the villages in the county are already doing this.
    In twenty-five villages in the seventh district, a total of 1,396 people suffered from measles. After receiving the report, the county immediately mobilized and organized 32 doctors, who divided the work to carry out suppression and treatment, stopping the spread in seven and a half days. In Honghe Village in that district, where measles was most serious, the children of Village Chief Li and a public security officer were about to die and had already been placed on straw mats. Five model doctors from the tenth district, Fu Wanchun, Shen Huaide, Liu Peichun, Qin Shouzheng, and Cui Fusong, rushed to the scene to diagnose and treat them, giving injections and medicine. They improved the same day, and the patients escaped danger, which was greatly appreciated by the people. These five doctors were in charge of treatment in the village, and no patients died.
    Because the tenth district is the key district of Lin County, with a sound medical association organization, a health committee in each village, and a health team for every ten households, measles did not spread in the tenth district. It was eliminated in time after being discovered, and there were no deaths.
    Meeting System: The County Health and Epidemic Prevention Committee holds irregular meetings. When there are major tasks or an epidemic is discovered, it convenes the Medical Research Associations of each district to discuss and negotiate everything. In addition to meetings, the Medical Research Association and the County Health Committee make a work briefing once a month and a summary report every two months. The doctor teams report to the district Medical Research Association every five days, a ten-day report, and a monthly summary. Each doctor makes irregular briefings to the doctor teams.
    Review of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Doctors: The district Medical Research Association leads the doctor teams to identify and approve doctors in a democratic manner. The conditions are: the medical point of view must be correct, they must have technical ability, and they must have prestige among the masses. After everyone's comments, a medical practice certificate is issued. Those without skills are transferred to other jobs, and weaker groups help each other to cultivate.
    The review of all doctors in the county was completed in late March, and medical practice certificates will be issued soon. The tenth district did the best in this work.
    Finally, everyone made a twelve-point work plan for 1950, which is to implement the health policy of "prevention first, treatment second"; organize traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors, strengthen treatment to cooperate with agricultural production, and increase grain production by ten catties per mu; respond to every request and automatically go to the countryside to find patients; traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors should unite, exchange experience and oppose conservatism....
    Training of Midwives: Two sessions of intensive training were conducted, totaling 178 people. In December 1949, 68 people were trained (20 in the second district, 23 in the third district, and 25 in the fifth district). In 1950, 110 people were trained (40 in the first district, 30 in the eighth district, and 40 in the tenth district). On average, there is one to two midwives per administrative village. During the training, lectures, casual talks, posters, and various other methods were used to make it easier for them to accept. The enthusiasm of the midwives was high, and even when sleeping at night, they were still discussing new midwifery methods in twos and threes.
    After the training, each district established a midwifery team to establish working connections, exchange experiences, and discuss how to carry out publicity. They held a meeting once a month, some joined the Women's Federation, and some joined the Medical Research Association.
    Wang Xinyue, a midwife from Hexi Village in the second district, organized Li Suzhi, Guo Yulan, Niu Lianhua, and Li Heyu after returning from training. In addition to publicity, the five people personally tested the benefits of washing menstrual cloths and washing the vulva, and promoted these benefits at the representative meeting, advocating that women wash the vulva and menstrual cloths with cold water, scald them with boiling water, and dry them in the sun to keep them clean.
    The mother of Wang Shanlin in Yao Village in the tenth district is the captain of the midwives. After learning the new method, she delivered a total of ten children this year, all of whom survived. In Caiyuan Village, a woman could not give birth, and because the time was too long, the child was in great danger. The old woman Wang used artificial respiration to save the child, and the mother was also safe. The masses said: "A sage has appeared, and even the dead can be saved." The Special Commissioner's Women's Federation specially awarded her a red flag of "Savior of Women and Infants."
    In villages where new methods of delivery are used, infants are very safe. Liu Lin Village had a total of four births, Xiaodongpo Village had a total of six births, Lijia Village had a total of seventeen births, Yuan Kang Village had a total of seven births, and Hexi Village had a total of nine births, and none of them died. Wangjiazhuang had a total of eight births, with only one death (umbilical tetanus).
    The situation with the old method of delivery is different. Guojiagang had a total of four births with one death. Guojiatun had a total of nine births with four deaths. Bageda Village had a total of five births with two deaths. Liushitang Village had a total of eight births with three deaths.
    Organize Medical Cooperatives: At present, only districts four, five, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve have organized this kind of cooperative. They are all operated by the masses voluntarily investing in shares. The cooperative has managers and accountants, whose salary is two catties of millet per day, without food, which is democratically determined.
    Publicity on Vaccination and Immunization Injections: Before the injection, the county mobilized and promoted the benefits of vaccination at a teachers' conference attended by 570 teachers. A total of 93,000 people were vaccinated in the county, and each district made a summary and selected models.
    Before the immunization injections, 30 teachers were trained, and the work was studied, discussed, arranged, and specifically divided at the County Health Committee and the District Medical Research Association. During the injection, cadres were mobilized to take the lead in getting injections without delaying production, and injections were concentrated in one place. When it rained, they went door-to-door to give injections. Injections were not given to those who were sick, pregnant, or children under ten years old. The injection task is 100,000 people, and 68,318 people have already been injected.
    The main reasons why Lin County has achieved the above results are as follows:
    First, the leadership attaches importance to health work. For example, Yang Jue, Secretary of the Anyang Prefectural Committee, conveyed the provincial government's 1950 health work instructions at the Party Congress of the Prefectural Committee and specifically arranged the work. The work was checked and summarized in a timely manner, and the policy of establishing meritorious models was implemented. Doctors Guo Shouguang and Liu Jianxun, etc., have won the glorious title of model three times in seven months. At the same time, the leadership can promptly criticize and correct shortcomings.
    Second, the leadership solves problems relatively quickly. For example, the representatives of the Medical Education Research Association raised three issues at the county and district people's congresses: travel expenses, production mutual assistance, and the issue of doctors' meals when they go to the countryside for epidemic prevention. After discussion at the county people's congress, a resolution was made and handed over to the county government and district and village governments for implementation. During the epidemic prevention period, you can be exempt from travel. During the production period, doctors participating in epidemic prevention work are cultivated and harvested by the village mutual aid group. The problem of meals for large epidemic prevention work groups is solved by the county and district in a unified manner, and the rest is left by each village with one dou of local grain for doctors to eat when they go to the village.
    Although we have achieved the above results, we believe that there are still shortcomings, and we put forward the following opinions: First, the hygiene of the organs is relatively poor, and the provincial party committee and the provincial government's instructions on organ hygiene, development, and strengthening of cadre health care work have not been well implemented. Second, the method of training midwives is relatively good, but the investigation work before the training is not enough, and the universal organization work after the training is also not enough. Third, the development of rural health work mainly relies on the three-level health committees and health teams of the county, district, and village. This work has now been given attention, and we must further strengthen supervision, inspection, and commendation work in the future so that the grassroots organizations can be consolidated. The experience and lessons of other areas are: "If the leadership attaches importance to it, there will be very good results; if the leadership lets go, the center shifts, and everything will collapse." Fourth, according to the experience of areas where measles, smallpox, cholera, typhoid and other infectious diseases occurred last year, publicity should be carried out well in the area, and universal immunization injections and vaccinations should be carried out, and epidemic stations should be established in order to grasp the epidemic situation and deal with it in a timely manner so as to avoid repeating the mistakes of Yuanyang of Xinxiang Special Commissioner's Office and Hebi Town of Anyang Special Commissioner's Office.

　　林县卫生工作检查总结
    平原省卫生局
    林县是我省安阳专区的卫生重点县，人口有四五七八○五人，男二二九五七三人、女二二八二三二人。有十二个区、五四一村庄。有一个林县师范学校、十座高小、五三三座初级小学，中小教员七六○位。
    卫生组织机构：全县有医生六○五人，西医四二人、中医五六三人，全县模范医生二二人，十区占十三人、经县人民政府批准发给奖状的十一人。组织系统是：县卫生防疫委员会领导区的医药研究会，区的医药研究会领导联坊的医生小组，联坊的医生小组领导村卫生委员会。全县共有一二四○○个卫生小组。以上各会的负责人员都是经过民主选举的，会与会连系也很周密，设若某地区一旦发生传染病，他们按组织系统迅速向上级报告传达，一直到区。区除向县卫生防疫委员会汇报情况外，马上将当地之医生组织起来，定名为突击治疗队，再分成小队，进行扑救。
    各村普遍贴有卫生标语，如：注意卫生防止疾病，有病要请医生瞧，求神拜佛瞎胡闹。不喝生水，水里有微生物，喝了容易生病等等。
    街道胡同每十户悬挂卫生交界牌、卫生组长牌、清洁扫除值日牌，并规定三天一大扫除，院内一天一扫除，并且组长与检查宣传委员及时检查总结，在广播台上宣布好坏小组及家庭卫生。每家都规定下地作活要带开水，日常不穿脏衣服，被褥要经常晒。还要总结创造模范家庭的经验。全县已有二分之一村庄都这样做。
    七区二十五个村子计有患麻疹者一三九六人，县得报后，马上调动组织医生三二人，分工进行扑灭治疗，七日半即停止蔓延。该区洪河村，麻疹最严重，李村长及一位公安员的小孩将死，已放在草扇子上，十区五位模范医生傅万春、申怀德、刘培春、秦守政、崔甫松，赶赴诊治，进行打针吃药，当天好转，病人逃出了危险，众人感激不尽。这五位医生担任该村治疗，病人无一死亡。
    由于十区为林县重点区，医联组织健全，每村有卫生委员会，每十户有卫生小组，故麻疹未在十区流行。发现后即时消灭，未有死亡。
    会议制度：县卫生防疫委员会，开会不定期，遇有重大任务，发现疾病流行时，即召集各区医药研究会，来讨论商议一切，除开会外，医药研究会同县卫生委员会，一月作一次工作简报，两个月作一次总结报告，医生小组向区医药研究会五天一汇报，十天一旬报，一月一总结，每个医生不定期的向医生小组作简报。
    审查中西医：以区医药研究会领导医生小组用民主方式甄别审定，条件是：行医的观点要正确，要有技术能力，并在群众当中有威信者，经大家评论，发给行医证。没有技术的使他转业，较弱的小组互助培养。
    全县医生审查在三月下旬进行完竣，即将发行医证。该项工作做得最好的是十区。
    最后大家又订了一九五○年工作计划十二条，要贯彻防疫为主，治疗为辅的卫生方针；组织中西医，加强治疗配合农业生产，每亩地要增产食粮十斤；有求必应，自动下乡找病人；中西医生要团结起来，交流经验反对保守……。
    训练接生员：集训两期共训练了一七八人，计一九四九年十二月训练了六八人（二区二○、三区二三、五区二五），一九五○年训练了一一○人（一区四○、八区三十、十区四○），平均每行政村有一至二个接生员。一九五○年计划将全县接生员轮训完毕。在训练当中，利用讲解、漫谈、挂图及各样不同的方式方法，使他们容易接受。接产员的情绪高涨，甚至晚间睡觉时，三三两两的还在讨论新接生法。
    训练完后每区成立接生小组，建立工作连系，互相交流经验，商讨如何进行宣传。一个月开会一次，有的加入妇联会，有的加入医药研究会。
    二区河西村接生员王新月受训回来后，便组织了李素之、郭玉兰、牛莲花、李和玉四人。除进行宣传外、五个人并亲自试验洗月经布、洗外阴部的好处，并在代表会上宣传这种好处，要妇女洗外阴部，洗月经布要用凉水洗，开水烫，太阳晒，保存得干净。
    十区尧村王山林的母亲是接生员队长，学了新办法后，今年共接了十个孩子都活了。在菜园村有一个产妇，产不下来，因时间过长，孩子很危险。王老太太用人工呼吸法把小孩救活了，大人也安全。群众都说：出了圣人，死人也给救活了。专署妇联特奖他一面“妇婴救星”的红旗。
    用新法接生的村庄，婴孩都很安全。柳林村共生四个，小东坡村共生六个，李家村共生十七个，元康村共生七个，河西村共生九个，都无一死亡。王家庄共生八个，仅死亡一个（脐风）。
    用旧法接生的情况就不同了。郭家冈共生四个死亡一个。郭家屯共生九个死亡四个。八各答村共生五个，死亡二个。刘石棠村共生八个，死亡三个。
    组织医药合作社：现只有四、五、九、十、十一、十二等区已组织了此种合作社，都是群众自愿入股经营。社里有经理、会计人员，待遇是每日二斤小米，不管吃，是民主评定的。
    宣传种痘及防疫注射：在注射前县里作了动员，在五七○位教员参加的教员会议上，宣传种痘的好处。全县共种了九三○○○人，各区作了总结，选出了模范。
    在防疫注射前训练了三○位教员，并在县卫生委员会上与区医药研究会上作了研究讨论、布置工作、具体分工。在注射当中发动干部，带头打针，不误生产，集中一地注射。下雨时即挨门去打针。不给有病者、怀孕者、以及十岁以下的小孩打针。注射任务是十万人，现已注射六八三一八人。
    林县取得上述成绩的主要原因如下：
    第一、领导上重视卫生工作。如安阳地委书记杨珏同志，将省府一九五○年卫生工作指示，在地委党代会上加以传达，并具体布置工作。及时检查与总结工作，贯彻了立功表模的方针。郭守光、刘建勋等医生七个月中前后共得三次模范的光荣称号。同时有了缺点领导上也能及时加以批评与纠正。
    第二、领导上解决问题比较及时。如医教研究会之代表在县区各界代表大会上提出出差问题、生产互助问题、以及医生们下乡防疫时的吃饭问题等三项，经县代表会讨论作出决议，交县府及区、村政府执行。在防疫期间可免差。在生产时期，医生参加防疫工作，由村互助组代耕代收。大的防疫工作组的吃饭问题，由县区统一解决，其他由每村留地方粮一斗，作为医生到村吃饭之用。
    虽有以上成绩，但我们认为还有缺点，我们提出如下意见：第一，机关卫生比较差，没有很好执行省委及省府有关机关卫生、开展及加强干部保健工作的指示。第二，训练接生员办法比较好，但训练前调查工作做得不够，训练后普遍组织工作亦做得不够。第三，农村卫生工作的开展，主要靠县、区、村三级卫生委员及卫生小组。这一工作现已重视，今后更要加强督促检查和表扬工作，以便基层组织巩固起来。其他某些区域的经验教训是：“领导上重视，即有很好成绩；领导一松手，中心一转移，即全面垮台了。”第四，应该根据去年发生麻疹、天花、霍乱、伤寒等传染病的地区的经验，很好的在该区开展宣传，并普遍进行防疫注射与种痘，建立疫情站，以便掌握疫情，即时处理，以免重蹈新乡专署的原阳与安阳专署的何壁镇的覆辙。
