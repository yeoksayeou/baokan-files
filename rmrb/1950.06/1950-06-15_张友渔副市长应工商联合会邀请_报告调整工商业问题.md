　　Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu, Invited by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Reports on Adjusting Industrial and Commercial Issues

　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, at the invitation of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, delivered a three-and-a-half-hour report at the Democratic Theater to more than 1,000 industrialists and businessmen in Beijing on the issue of adjusting industry and commerce. Based on the resolutions of the National Conference of Industry and Commerce Bureau Directors, he analyzed the general situation of industry and commerce across the country and explained some of the measures taken by the Central People's Government to adjust industry and commerce. He also explained the following specific measures taken by the Beijing Municipal People's Government:

　　First, Adjusting Public-Private Relations: (1) More planned efforts will be made in processing, ordering, and purchasing from private industries, and processing profits will be adjusted; the Industry Bureau will uniformly manage processing and ordering to ensure reasonable distribution. (2) Regarding public-private commercial relations, the scope and proportion of retail companies' operations have been adjusted, and the wholesale and retail prices are being adjusted.

　　Second, Calling on Labor and Management to Cooperate to Overcome Difficulties: Labor-management consultation meetings have been established in nine industries in Beijing, including mechanized flour milling, as well as in many factories and stores. The general results have been very good, and it is hoped that they can be universally established throughout the city. Consultation means discussion, and there will be small troubles in the process of discussion, but small troubles can solve big troubles. Secondly, it is necessary to actively manage and improve management to have a future. The government will definitely help those who actively manage but have real difficulties. Two types of business practices must be changed: one is the dishonest and irregular adventurous speculation; the other is the old method of not paying attention to sales, which is already outdated! The current business method must be oriented towards the broad masses of the people, with small profits and quick turnover. For enterprises with excessively high wages that are indeed losing money, even if various methods are used and they still cannot be maintained, wages can be appropriately reduced or temporarily reduced through labor-management consultation based on specific circumstances. In addition, labor discipline should be strengthened, and work efficiency should be improved. The attitude of a few employees who hinder production and do not work hard is also not allowed.

　　Third, Solving the Problem of Funding Difficulties for Industry and Commerce: (1) Establishing a joint public-private banking syndicate: More than 500 million has already been loaned out, and it is planned to relax the conditions further in the future. (2) Establishing a joint public-private Industry and Commerce Co., Ltd. to concentrate social idle capital and invest it in production. (3) The People's Bank of China will strengthen its lending business. It has now decided to relax the conditions and provide loan support to commerce, especially transportation, which connects urban and rural material exchanges.

　　Fourth, Improving Taxation to Take Care of the Current Difficulties of Industry and Commerce: (1) The Tax Bureau has酌予 reduced, exempted, and deferred tax payments for industrial and commercial tax arrears households in the second half of 1949 who are genuinely experiencing difficulties, totaling more than 2.85 billion yuan. (2) Simplifying tax collection procedures.

　　Fifth, the government and the industrial and commercial sectors are studying how to improve the planning of public and private industry and commerce and strive to overcome blindness. It is also planned to form a special committee with people from the industrial and commercial sectors to adjust industry and commerce. As for the working group formed by various financial and economic units three weeks ago, it has been decided to continue working, going to major industries, factories, and stores to understand the situation and solve problems.

　　Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu emphasized in his report that the government's policy of stabilizing prices is beneficial to the broad masses of the people, including the industrial and commercial sectors, and cannot be changed. As for the temporary difficulties currently encountered by industry and commerce in Beijing, on the one hand, the government will resolutely implement the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and provide care in all aspects. On the other hand, industrialists and businessmen must also recognize the important role of private industry and commerce in today's national construction, respond to the call of Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Central People's Government on "May Day" Labor Day, spend a little effort, and actively engage in business to keep up with the times. The current situation in the Beijing market has improved. As long as the government, the industrial and commercial sectors, and the workers cooperate, industry and commerce have a future.

　　张友渔副市长应工商联合会邀请
    报告调整工商业问题
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府张友渔副市长十二日应工商联合会筹委会之请，在民主剧场向京市工商业家一千余人作了历三小时半的关于调整工商业问题的报告。他根据全国工商局长会议的决议，分析了全国工商业目前一般情况，说明中央人民政府对调整工商业的一些措施；并对京市人民政府所采取的一些具体办法，作了如下的解释：
    第一、调整公私关系：（一）更有计划地进行对私营工业加工、订货、收购等工作，并调整加工利润；由工业局统一管理加工订货，以期分配合理；（二）在公私商业关系上，现已调整了零售公司的经营范围与比重，正在调整批发与零售价格。
    第二、号召劳资协力度过困难：京市已有机制面粉等九个行业以及不少工厂商店建立了劳资协商会议，一般的效果都很好，希望全市能普遍建立起来。协商便是商量，商量当中是会有小麻烦的，但小麻烦能解决大麻烦。其次必须积极经营，改善管理，才有前途。对于积极经营而确实有困难的，政府一定会帮助他们。有两种经营方式必须要改，一种是不老实、不规矩的冒险家投机倒把的办法；一种是太不讲究推销的老办法，这些都已经过时了！现在的经营方法必须是面向广大人民，薄利多销。对于工资过高，而目前确实赔钱的企业，虽用种种办法仍不能维持的，可经过劳资协商，根据具体情况，适当降低或暂时降低工资。此外，还应加强劳动纪律、提高工作效率，少数职工妨碍生产、不好好做工的态度，也是不允许的。
    第三、解决工商业资金困难问题：（一）举办公私联合银团：已贷出五亿多，今后拟更放宽条件；（二）举办公私合营的兴业股份有限公司，集中社会游资，投向生产；（三）人民银行加强贷款业务，现决定放宽条件，对沟通城乡物资交流的商业特别是运输业，也给与贷款扶植。
    第四、改进税收，照顾工商业目前困难：（一）税务局于一九四九年下半年工商业税滞纳户，其确实困难者，已酌予减、免，缓缴税款，共达二十八亿五千余万元；（二）简化征税手续。
    第五、政府与工商业界正研究如何提高公私营工商业的计划性，竭力克服盲目性。并拟与工商界人士筹组一个专门调整工商业的委员会，至于三星期前由各财经单位组成的工作组，决定继续工作下去，到各主要行业各厂店去了解情况，解决问题。
    张友渔副市长在报告中最后并强调说明：政府稳定物价的方针，是对全国广大人民包括工商业界在内都是有好处的，是不能变的；至于京市工商业目前所遇到的暂时困难，一方面政府一定坚决执行公私兼顾政策，予以各方面的照顾；另一方面，工商业家一定也要认识私人工商业在今天国家建设中的重要作用，响应中央人民政府刘少奇副主席“五一”劳动节的号召，花费一点气力，积极起来经营，赶上时代。目前北京市场情况已有好转，只要政府、工商业界、工人大家合作，工商业是有前途的。
