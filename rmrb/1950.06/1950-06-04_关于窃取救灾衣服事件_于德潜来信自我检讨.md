　　On the Theft of Disaster Relief Clothing: A Self-Criticism Letter from Yu Deqian
　　To the Editor:
　　After reading the article "Some Cadres in the Fourth District of Yutian Steal Disaster Relief Clothing and Infringe Upon the Interests of the People" published in the May 16th "People's Garden," and the letter from a reader at the Tangshan Public Security Bureau on May 23rd suggesting that "the people's court should impose legal sanctions," I have reflected on myself and realized that the criticism in the "People's Garden" and the reader's opinion are completely correct. Since coming to the court, I have not only reflected on the theft of disaster relief clothing, but also deeply recalled all the incorrect ideological viewpoints and bureaucratic work styles that infringed upon the interests of the people in the past. Now I will write down the facts of my mistakes and my self-criticism below, and I hope that my fellow readers will help me correct them.
　　1. Infringing upon the interests of the people and embezzling public grain. Due to my incorrect ideological viewpoint and selfishness, I not only illegally exchanged disaster relief clothing this time, but also secretly smoked one or two liang and two qian of opium confiscated by the organization with the secretary in the past. In March of this year, I and four other people used 290 jin of rice converted from public firewood from the past, and I used 90 jin of rice to make two suits of clothes and a pair of shorts for myself; nominally it was borrowed, but it has not been returned to this day. In 1948, when the district collected cotton, I overweighed 75 jin, and did not report it to the higher authorities, but sold it privately; in addition to taking out 220,000 yuan to buy a set of mimeograph equipment, I used six dou of corn, one dou of sorghum, and three jin of cotton for myself. In addition, I also privately used 60 jin of river labor grain from the district.
　　2. Bureaucratic work style: I myself am the deputy district head, and the finance and grain assistant dared not stop me from taking clothes and using public grain. Although I was doing disaster relief work in the disaster area, my thoughts were not truly serving the people. Looking back, I really ate the people's millet for nothing, and I am sorry for the cultivation and education of the people and the revolution. In addition to returning the things in time, I also ask the people to accuse me, and the higher authorities to punish me. I must thoroughly correct my mistakes and start anew, and do more good things for the masses to atone for my sins.

　　Yu Deqian, Deputy District Head of the Fourth District of Yutian County

　　关于窃取救灾衣服事件  于德潜来信自我检讨编辑同志：
    看到五月十六日“人民园地”登载“玉田四区部分干部窃取救灾衣服侵犯人民利益”一文，和二十三日唐山市公安局读者来信提出“应由人民法院依法制裁”的意见后，我经过自己反省，认识到“人民园地”的批评和读者的意见是完全正确的。自我到法院后，不仅对窃取救灾衣服的事作了反省，对于过去侵犯人民利益的一切不正确的思想观点和官僚主义作风也作了深刻回忆。现在把我所犯错误的事实和检讨写在下面，并希读者同志帮助我改过。
    一、侵犯人民利益，贪污公粮。由于我的思想观点不正确，自私自利，不但这次非法换取救灾衣服；以前并曾把机关没收的一两二钱大烟，和秘书俩人私下吸了。今年三月份，我和其他四个人动用了过去公柴折下的大米二百九十斤，自己用九十斤米做了两身衣服、一个裤衩；名义是借，但至今没还。一九四八年区里收棉花，我多秤了七十五斤，没向上级报告，私自卖掉；除了拿出二十二万元买了一套油印器具外，自己用了六斗玉米、一斗红粮、三斤棉花。此外，还曾私用区里河工粮六十斤。
    二、官僚主义作风：我自己是副区长，拿衣服和动用公粮，财粮助理不敢制止。自己虽在灾区做救灾工作，但思想上不是真正为人民服务。检讨起来，真是白吃了人民的小米，对不起人民和革命的培养与教育。我除了及时将东西补还外，并请求人民对我控诉，上级给我处罚。我今后一定要痛改前非，重新作人，为群众多办些好事来赎罪。
    玉田县四区副区长  于德潜
