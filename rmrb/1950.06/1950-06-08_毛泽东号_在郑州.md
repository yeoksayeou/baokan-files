　　“Mao Zedong” Locomotive in Zhengzhou
　　By Our Correspondent Chen Ji
　　"Learning from the Soviet Union" -- This is the consistent and unremitting goal of all crew members of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, and one of the main reasons why they have become the national locomotive banner. They brought the advanced experience of the Soviet Union from Northeast China to Fengtai. Fengtai implemented the crew responsibility system, producing model drivers like Li Yonglu. They helped promote the responsibility system in Zhengzhou, which made the backward Zhengzhou locomotives look brand new. Under their influence, Zhengzhou launched a model locomotive team movement, with ninety locomotives having safely traveled more than 10,000 kilometers, and more than one hundred and forty locomotives having established a contracted responsibility system. Now, the old hero Li Yong is again calling on everyone in Zhengzhou: "Learn from the Soviet Union and launch a 500-kilometer locomotive movement!"
　　In the early days of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive's arrival in Zhengzhou, it encountered numerous difficulties and obstacles. Their task was to assist in the work in Zhengzhou, but many crew members of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot were not open to accepting their help. At the crew meetings, when the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew introduced their experience with the responsibility system, some people said: "What contracted responsibility system? We've been driving locomotives for more than ten years without learning this, and we can still make a living with our own skills." The "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew never lost heart when they heard these reactions. They always maintained the attitude of "learning from comrades in the new area" and explained to everyone sincerely. They understood that words alone could not clear up the masses' conservative thinking, so they decided to go to each locomotive to provide concrete assistance. Zhang Yuhai and Wu Haimin went to the "1554" locomotive, and everyone felt strange: "Why did the 'Mao Zedong' locomotive send people to work on our train?" Some people even guessed: "This must be the superiors sending them to monitor us." Guo Shude and Yue Shangwu also encountered resistance from conservative thinking and complacency on the "777" locomotive. But Li Yong said: "We must be even more humble." Driver Guo Shude also said: "Let's work patiently, and they will slowly understand us."
　　The "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew took the lead in wiping the trains and oiling them on each locomotive, without showing any pride. The "1554" locomotive crew said: "The 'Mao Zedong' locomotive old comrades are working even harder than us." Some old drivers who had been driving for more than twenty years saw Yue Shangwu driving fast and operating the locomotive skillfully, and they nodded with admiration: "The 'Mao Zedong' locomotive crew really has what it takes." When Yue Shangwu taught them how to use emergency braking, Wang Deyou said with great emotion: "We have never learned this new operating procedure. It's a wonder we haven't had an accident after driving blindly for decades!" After listening to Yue Shangwu's technical lesson, Wang Deyou said: "Old Yue's guidance has given me confidence when driving." When Zhang Yuhai helped them work, he taught them how to make daily plans, how to oil, stoke the fire, call out, and respond. Sometimes he even used diagrams to dissect the principles of the machine, explaining why it was necessary to do so. Stoker Yuan Shirong originally didn't understand the technology, but after Zhang Yuhai's half-month of assistance, he learned the principles of oil cups and air compression.
　　This concrete and patient assistance changed the Zhengzhou crew's perception of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive.
　　Wherever the "Mao Zedong" locomotive driver Li Yong went, there was a chorus of welcome. Wherever the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew went to work, the staff there would say: "This is great!" The slogans "Learn from the Mao Zedong Locomotive" were plastered all over the stations and sections of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. They began to manage their locomotives with the "Mao Zedong" locomotive's work attitude. In the past, the locomotives of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot had a nickname: "Oil Bags," because the locomotives were covered in oil and mud inside and out, and the locomotive metal never saw the light of day. Since learning from the "Mao Zedong" locomotive and implementing the responsibility system, these locomotives have changed their appearance (for details, see page two of this newspaper on May 28). They began to cherish their locomotives as they cherish their own bodies, carefully checking the locomotive parts at each stop, keeping the water level and oil volume at a certain standard. They seriously studied maintenance. Before each shift change, they carefully checked the locomotive. Now, the locomotives of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot have been polished brightly, and they are no longer called "Oil Bag" trains. Journal burnouts and wear accidents have been reduced: in the past, they occurred three or four times a week, now they occur less than once every two weeks. Locomotive quality has improved, and the safe running kilometers have gradually increased. Eleven locomotives in the entire Zhengzhou Railway Bureau have safely traveled more than 40,000 kilometers.
　　The "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew not only sincerely helped others to improve, but also always led everyone with their exemplary behavior. The Ministry of Railways required them to never have an accident, and the old hero Li Yong said: "We will definitely be able to do it!" They highly displayed the working class's enthusiasm and creativity, and under extremely difficult conditions, they once pulled 2,015 tons, exceeding the Zhengzhou Bureau's standard traction tonnage by 315 tons, and also saved more than 4,000 kilograms of coal. On a 6% gradient, they always maintained a speed of 18 kilometers per hour (equal to the speed of other locomotives pulling 1,000 tons), creating a new record in the history of Longhai and Jinghan lines, breaking the conservative thinking of some locomotive personnel in Zhengzhou who believed that "the tonnage cannot be increased." Deng Changlin, a 58-year-old boilermaker, said: "At first, I doubted whether the 'Mao Zedong' locomotive could go uphill with such a heavy load? Now the facts prove that my doubts were unfounded." After the news that the "Mao Zedong" locomotive exceeded the traction tonnage spread, the "258" locomotive crew held a meeting to discuss it, and everyone said: "The 'Mao Zedong' locomotive has opened up a path for us, and we must follow it together." Recently, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive has formulated a new plan: to regularly exceed the traction of 1,800 tons without delay; to guarantee a 50% saving of coal, a 5% saving of gasoline, a 10% saving of axle oil, and a 30% saving of wind pump oil... The "Mao Zedong" locomotive will definitely achieve these plans.
　　The model locomotive banner of New China -- the "Mao Zedong" locomotive will forever illuminate all the locomotives of New China with its victorious light. We will soon see thousands of model locomotives becoming the second "Mao Zedong" locomotive.

　　“毛泽东号”在郑州
    本报记者  陈迹
    “学习苏联”——这是“毛泽东号”机车全体乘务员始终不懈地奋斗目标，也是他们所以能成为全国机车旗帜的主要原因之一。他们把苏联的先进经验，从东北带到丰台。丰台实行了乘务负责制，产生了像李永禄这样的模范司机手。他们在郑州帮助推行负责制，使落后的郑州机车都焕然一新。在他们的影响下，郑州开展了模范机车队运动，已有九十台机车安全走行一万公里以上，一百四十余台机车建立了包乘制。现在，老英雄李永又在郑州号召大家：“学习苏联，来一个机车五百公里运动！”
    “毛泽东号”机车开到郑州的初期，曾碰到重重的困难和阻挠。他们的任务是在郑州帮助工作，但是，郑州机务段许多乘务员并不虚心接受他们的帮助。在乘务员会议上，“毛泽东号”乘务员介绍负责制的经验时，有些人就说：“什么包乘制？咱们开车十来年，没学这一套，照样能靠自己的本领吃饭。”“毛泽东号”乘务员听了这些反映，从不泄气。他们始终抱着“向新区同志们学习”的态度，诚恳地向大家解释。他们明白：仅仅用口说，不能澄清群众的保守思想，他们决定到各机车上具体地帮助工作。张玉海和武海民到了“一五五四”机车上，大家都觉得奇怪：“为什么‘毛泽东号’派人到我们车上来工作？”有些人甚至猜想：“这一定是上级要他们来监视我们的。”郭树德和岳尚武在“七七七”机车上，也同样地遇到保守思想和自满情绪的抵抗。但李永说：“咱们更要虚心。”司机郭树德也说：“咱们耐心地干，他们会慢慢了解我们的。”
    “毛泽东号”的乘务员在各个机车上，都带头擦车、给油，没有丝毫骄傲的表现。“一五五四”机车乘务员说：“‘毛泽东号’的老大哥比咱们干得还有劲。”有些干了二十多年的老司机看见岳尚武沉着地开快车，熟练地操纵机车，他们点头羡慕：“毛泽东号的乘务员真有一手。”当岳尚武教他们使用紧急制动时，王德有很感慨地说：“咱从来没学过这新操纵规程。咱几十年来瞎开车，不出事故，那才怪呢！”王德有听了岳尚武的技术课以后，他说：“老岳的指导，使咱开车时心里有了把握。”张玉海帮助他们工作时，教他们怎样按日订计划，怎样给油、焚火、呼喊、应答，有时他还以图画剖解机器原理，说明为什么要这样做。司炉原世荣本来不懂技术，经过张玉海的半个月的帮助，学会了油盅和空气压缩的原理。
    这种具体、耐心地帮助，使得郑州乘务员改变了对“毛泽东号”的看法。
    “毛泽东号”司机长李永走到那里，那里就响起一片欢迎的声音。“毛泽东号”乘务员到那里工作，那里的员工就说：“这太好啰！”郑州铁路局所属各站段，贴遍了“向毛泽东号学习”的标语。他们开始以“毛泽东号”的工作态度，管理自己的机车。郑州机务段的机车，过去有个外号，叫做：“油包”，因为机车里外都是油泥，机车铁皮永远见不着天日。自从学习“毛泽东号”，贯彻负责制后，这些机车都变了模样（详情见五月二十八日本报二版）。他们开始像爱护自己身体一样来爱护自己的机车，每到一站，就仔细检查机车零件，使水位、油量保持着一定的标准。他们认真学习了检修。每次交班以前，都详细检点机车。现在，郑州机务段的机车都被擦得发亮，不再让人家叫做“油包”车了。烧轴和磨耗事故已经减少：过去每星期发生三四次，现在每两星期还发生不了一次。机车质量提高，安全走行公里逐渐增多。全郑州铁路局已有十一台机车安全走行了四万多公里。
    “毛泽东号”乘务员不但诚心诚意地帮助别人进步，而且时时刻刻以自己的模范行为带动大家。铁道部要求他们永远不出事故，老英雄李永说：“我们一定能办到！”他们高度发挥了工人阶级的积极性与创造性，在极困难的条件下，曾经一次拉了两千零十五吨，超过郑州局标准牵引吨数三百一十五吨，还节省了四千多公斤煤。在千分之六的坡道上，始终保持每小时十八公里的速度（与其他机车拉一千吨时的速度相等），创造了陇海、京汉有史以来的新纪录，打破了郑州某些机务人员认为“不能多拉吨数”的保守思想。五十八岁的老锅炉匠邓长林说：“起先咱怀疑‘毛泽东号’拉这么重，能上坡不能？现在的事实，证明咱的怀疑没有根据。”“毛泽东号”超过牵引吨数的消息传出后，“二五八号”机车乘务员开会讨论，大家说：“毛泽东号给咱们开出了道路，咱们要跟随它一同前进。”最近，“毛泽东号”又订出了新的计划：经常超过牵引一千八百吨，不迟缓；保证省煤百分之五十，省汽油百分之五，省轴油百分之十，省风泵油百分之三十，……这些计划，“毛泽东号”一定会实现的。
    新中国模范机车旗帜——“毛泽东号”机车将永远以它的胜利光芒，照耀着新中国的所有火车头。我们不要多久就会看见千百个模范机车都会成为第二个“毛泽东号”。
