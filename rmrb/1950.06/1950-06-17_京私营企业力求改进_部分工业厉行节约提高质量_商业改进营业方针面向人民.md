Private Enterprises in Beijing Strive for Improvement
Some Industries Vigorously Practice Economy and Improve Quality
Commerce Improves Business Policies to Serve the People

[Our Newspaper] Reporter Lin Hong reports: Under the new situation of financial and price stability, private industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing are changing their business policies, reforming internal organizations, and vigorously practicing economy to improve product quality, reduce costs, and open up sales channels. At the beginning of March this year, when national prices fell, industrial and commercial circles in Beijing generally encountered difficulties in product sales and capital turnover, resulting in negative emotions. After explanations and assistance from relevant departments such as the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the Labor Bureau, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the factories and shops in Beijing have gradually been transformed over the past three months and have made many achievements. The output of Cihua Weaving Factory increased by 49 percent in April, and the quality increased by 27 percent. On April 5, the factory delivered 153 rolls of cloth to the Hua Sha Cloth Company, of which 10 rolls were returned; while on April 16, it delivered 160 rolls, but only 8 rolls were returned. The proportion of Class B cloth in Jingwei Weaving Factory decreased from 45 percent in March to 20 percent in April; while Class A cloth increased from 55 percent to 80 percent. In addition, cotton weaving cooperatives, Huadong Weaving Factory, Yuhua Xing Weaving Factory, and Xin Sheng and Yi Hua wool spinning factories have all made certain achievements in improving the quality and quantity of their products. In order to save raw materials and reduce expenses, factories and shops have also begun to adjust their organizations, reduce redundant personnel, and launch economy campaigns. The finished product losses of Nanyang and Huaxing Match Factories have decreased by 2.7 percent compared to the past, and the stem losses have decreased by 10 percent. Due to the decrease in retail business, Tian Zeng Hou Flour Mill transferred six apprentices from the front counter to the machine room to participate in production. Workers in the medicine tray department of Housheng Match Factory have also improved their working methods, saving one dose of medicine per day, equivalent to approximately 150,000 yuan; the box material factory sorts out unusable wood paper and sells it to fishmongers, increasing revenue by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per day; similar savings have been made in the packaging department, pharmacy, and other departments. Heng De Cheng Weaving Factory mobilized eight staff members to participate in production. Factories and shops have also dismantled unnecessary telephones, electric lights, or stoves, greatly reducing monthly expenses. For example, Tongfuju Restaurant cancelled its telephone, saving 360,000 yuan per month.

In the private commercial sector, in addition to coming up with ways to reduce wages and vigorously practice economy, they have also adopted the business policies of "serving the people" and "small profits and quick turnover," and the phenomena of slow sales and poor capital turnover have gradually changed. For example, Longsheng Cloth Store sold off high-end goods such as silks and woolens at low prices, replenished with mass-market goods needed by the general public, and appropriately reduced profits, and business has gradually improved. In May, daily turnover increased from more than one million yuan to more than two million yuan, and sometimes even exceeded five million yuan. Ruifuxiang and Sanyou Industrial Cooperative (department store) adopted the same policy, and the former's daily turnover increased from four to five million yuan to more than 20 million yuan, while the latter's daily turnover increased fivefold compared to March. Similar management methods have now been popularized in the catering, department store, traditional Chinese medicine, and bathhouse industries.

　　京私营企业力求改进
    部分工业厉行节约提高质量
    商业改进营业方针面向人民
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：在金融物价稳定的新局面下，京市私营工商业纷纷改变经营方针、改革内部组织、厉行节约，以求提高产品质量，减低成本，打开销路。今年三月初，全国物价下落，京市工商业界普遍遇到产品滞销和资金周转不灵的困难，产生了消极的情绪。经过京市人民政府、劳动局和市总工会等有关部门的解释和帮助，三个多月来，京市各工厂商店已在逐渐改造，作出了许多成绩。慈华织布厂四月份的产量提高了百分之四十九，质量提高了百分之二十七。该厂四月五日向花纱布公司交布一百五十三匹，即退回了十匹；而四月十六日交一百六十匹，却仅退回了八匹。经纬织布厂三月份的乙级布占百分之四十五，四月份减少到百分之二十；而甲级布则由百分之五十五增到百分之八十。此外，如棉织合作社、华东织布厂、裕华兴织布厂及新生、艺华两纺毛厂等，在提高产品的质与量上均有一定的成绩。为了节省原料、减少开支，各工厂商店并已着手调整机构、减少冗员，开展节约运动。南洋、华兴火柴厂的成品损失较过去减少百分之二点七、杆子损失减少百分之十。天增厚面粉厂由于门市业务减少，将前柜的六个练习生调到机器房参加生产。厚生火柴厂药盘部工人并改进工作方法，每日可节省一个药，约合十五万元；盒料厂将不能用的木纸整理卖给鱼贩，每日增加三、四万元的收入；包装部、药房等部门也有类似节约的事实。恒得成织布厂动员了八名职员参加生产。各工厂、商店并将不需要的电话、电灯或火炉等拆除，每月开支减少很多。如同福居饭庄撤消电话，每月节省三十六万元。
    在私营商业方面，除想出了一些减低工资、厉行节约等办法外，还采取了“面向人民”和“薄利多销”的营业方针，货物滞销和资金周转不灵的现象已逐渐改变。如隆盛布店，将绸缎呢绒等背货低价卖出，补进为广大人民所需要的大路货，并适当降低利润，营业便日渐好转，五月份时，每日流水由一百多万元增至二百多万元，有时甚至到过五百多万元。瑞蚨祥及三友实业社（百货）采取同一方针后，前者每日流水由四、五百万元增至两千多万元，后者每日流水则较三月份增加五倍。类似这样的经营方法，现已普及到饭食、百货、国药及浴堂等行业中。
