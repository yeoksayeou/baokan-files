　　From the Disappearance of False Purchasing Power to the Growth of Real Purchasing Power

　　In March and April of this year, private industrial and commercial enterprises across the country generally felt serious difficulties, but since May, they have partially begun to improve. The main reason for this widespread difficulty was the sudden stagnation in sales of goods; and the basic reason for the sudden stagnation in sales of goods was that after price stabilization, the market suddenly lost a large amount of false purchasing power.

　　In old China, the people's purchasing power was originally very low, because imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism had long exploited the Chinese people, especially after the Kuomintang reactionary government's twelve years of inflation, the actual purchasing power of the Chinese people became even lower. However, during the period of inflation, until January and February of this year, the purchasing power manifested in the market was much higher than after price stabilization in March and April of this year. What is the reason for this? This is mainly because as prices continued to rise, people across the country, in order to escape the losses from currency devaluation, rushed to purchase and hoard goods, coupled with large-scale hoarding by speculators, which abnormally created a false purchasing power and a false prosperity in the market.

　　This purchasing power was false because, except for a very few speculators, the actual income (purchasing power) of the people across the country not only did not increase at all, but instead decreased day by day. The extent of the economic losses inflicted on the Chinese people by the reactionary rulers of old China is impossible to calculate for the time being. The inflation alone was astonishing. In the eleven years from the beginning of the War of Resistance to the bankruptcy of the puppet "legal tender," prices rose a total of six million times, and the total amount of puppet "legal tender" issued was claimed by the Kuomintang puppet government to be six million trillion (actually more than this); during the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the areas occupied by the Japanese invaders, the Japanese puppets also had significant inflation; after Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang forced the issuance of "gold yuan coupons," and all these currencies subsequently became waste paper. The devaluation and collapse of these currencies undoubtedly inflicted losses on the people several times greater than the burden of grain taxes. Therefore, in old China, the actual purchasing power of the people did not increase, but rather continuously and rapidly declined.

　　The "market prosperity" caused by inflation forcing people to rush to purchase and hoard goods was also false, and it only manifested the prosperity of speculation. As a result of the rush to purchase and hoard goods, in addition to a portion of commodities such as grain and cotton cloth being dispersed and stored by the people, a large amount of goods were also hoarded in the hands of speculators and industrialists and businessmen themselves, and had not yet been consumed by society. The financial industry in old China was a major factor in promoting speculation. During the rapid rise in prices, although bank interest rates also rose, they often lagged behind prices. Therefore, many speculators, and even general industrialists and businessmen, competed to borrow money from banks to hoard materials. The faster prices rose, the more money they made, the greater the trend of speculation became, and the more false prosperity of supply falling short of demand appeared in the market. Obviously, behind this false prosperity, serious crises were hidden. If inflation accelerated, this false prosperity could be maintained temporarily; but as the actual purchasing power of the people decreased with inflation, the real market for these speculative hoarded goods would shrink. Once prices stopped rising, these speculative hoarded goods would inevitably have no sales outlets, and speculators with large inventories and heavy debts would inevitably find no way out, leading to bankruptcy.

　　In the twelve years of inflation, China's social economy and even the people's lives were completely changed, becoming very畸形 (deformed/abnormal). First, a large number of speculators appeared, who completely abandoned production, relying solely on speculation and profiteering, and enjoying a life of indulgence and decadence. This group of speculators, whose profession was "kicking the ball" and "snatching hats," became increasingly numerous during the period of inflation. It is estimated that there were 300,000 in Shanghai alone. Around this group of speculators, many extravagant and wasteful occupations developed. Second, a large number of banks and money shops serving speculation were formed, whose task was to absorb social idle funds, provide speculative funds, and encourage industrial and commercial capital to turn to the speculative market. Third, many industrialists and businessmen were also lured into the speculative market. They often devoted 90% of their energy to chasing prices and transferring funds, obtaining windfall profits from speculation and hoarding; and only 10% of their energy to taking care of their daily production and business operations. Therefore, many industrial and commercial enterprises had bloated organizations, corrupt management, and relied entirely on speculative profits to maintain themselves. As for the broad masses of the people, they were the victims of inflation, especially wage earners, whose salary increases could never keep up with rising prices. However, in order to survive, they also had to rush to purchase and store their necessary living materials, such as grain and cotton cloth, with meager salaries. The phenomenon of barter trade was widespread in the countryside. As a result, urban-rural exchange stagnated, and the lives of farmers were further plunged into poverty.

　　Twelve years of inflation disrupted the laws of production, sales, supply, and demand throughout society, and the blindness of the old Chinese economy developed to an unprecedented height. During inflation, prices often fluctuated violently, completely deviating from the norm. Under normal circumstances, the relationship between supply and demand and price changes often influenced each other. Supply and demand affected prices, and prices affected supply and demand, so that production and consumption could restore balance according to economic laws. But in inflation, currency issuance and rush purchasing and hoarding strongly stimulated prices, submerging the normal relationship between supply and demand, thus completely decoupling production and consumption. Although certain commodities were overproduced, they were still in short supply in the market. In essence, it was the decline in purchasing power, but on the surface, it presented "strong" purchasing power.

　　This abnormal phenomenon, of course, cannot continue to exist after price stabilization.

　　However, the real purchasing power of the people across the country will not only not disappear due to price stabilization, but will also steadily rise. Price stabilization only protects the people's consumption power from being constantly plundered by inflation, and will never reduce this consumption power. Of course, in order to restore the purchasing power of the people who have been plundered to the level before inflation, it will still take a considerable period of recuperation. However, the special state of stagnation that occurs in the early stage of the transition from inflation to price stabilization, that is, the stagnation caused by the sudden withdrawal of false purchasing power from the market, will pass quickly. The reason is: the amount of hoarded goods across the country is not too large, whether it is grain or yarn; and the inventory of each private factory is not thick. In order to meet the necessities of life and production, after these customers have used up their hoarded goods, and after seeing that prices do not continue to fall, they cannot always hold on to money and not buy things. In fact, the sales of goods across the country did not stop in March and April, and since May, the initial signs of improvement have begun to appear. And after the agricultural and industrial production of the whole country is gradually restored on a reliable basis, that is to say, after the land reform is completed, industry and commerce are adjusted, the war ends, military and administrative expenses are greatly reduced, and the state and the people can develop production in a planned way, the real purchasing power of China's hundreds of millions of people will inevitably gradually grow enormously.

　　Some industrialists and businessmen in the past and present have had some doubts about the central People's Government's policy of balancing financial revenue and expenditure and stabilizing financial prices. First, is price stabilization good, or is it better to continue inflation? Second, is it too early to stabilize financial prices before the war is completely over? Can it be delayed for another year or two before stabilizing? This meeting of directors of industry and commerce bureaus seriously discussed this issue, but the conclusion reached was: prices must be stabilized. Since we have the strength to stabilize prices this year, we should strive to stabilize prices this year. Because the fact is very clear, inflation has made the Chinese economy completely rotten, and we must never be infatuated with this false "prosperity" that poisons the people and poisons production, and continue to move towards destruction. If prices are stabilized next year, the same difficulties as in March and April of this year will still occur next year, which will only make the people across the country suffer an extra year of pain, consume the vitality of the national economy for an extra year, and make future recovery more difficult.

　　Therefore, we should maintain financial balance and financial and price stability, and steadily advance towards the bright future of the ever-increasing real purchasing power. On this broad road, we should have no doubts or wavering.

### 从虚假购买力的消失到真实购买力的增长

　　从虚假购买力的消失到真实购买力的增长
    今年三、四月间，全国私营工商业曾经普遍感到严重的困难，五月起则已部分开始好转。造成这种普遍困难的主要原因是商品突然滞销；而造成商品突然滞销的基本原因，则是由于物价稳定后，市场上突然失去了大量的虚假购买力。
    在旧中国，人民的购买力本来很低的，因为帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义长期地压榨中国人民，特别是经过国民党反动政府十二年的通货膨胀，中国人民的实际购买力更加低落。但在通货膨胀期中，直到今年一、二月为止，市场上表现出来的购买力，远比今年三、四月份物价稳定以后要高。这是什么原因呢？这主要是由于在物价继续高涨中，全国人民为着逃避货币贬值的损失，竞相抢购囤积，加上投机商人的大量囤积，这样就变态地出现了一种虚假的购买力，和市场的虚假的繁荣。
    这种购买力是虚假的，因为除极少数投机商人外，那时全国人民的实际的收入（购买力）不但没有丝毫增加，相反的是日益减少了。旧中国反动统治者所加于中国人民经济的损失，其浩大程度，一时无法计算，单就通货膨胀一项来讲，已属惊人。从抗战开始到伪“法币”宣告破产这十一年中，物价共上涨了六百万倍，伪“法币”发行总数据国民党伪政府宣称是六百万亿（实际不止此数）；抗日战争时期，在日寇占领区，日伪也有很大的通货膨胀；日本投降后，国民党又强迫发行了“金元券”，所有这些货币均先后成为废纸。这些货币的贬值与崩溃，所加于人民的损失，无疑是若干倍于粮税的负担。因此，在旧中国，人民的实际购买力，不是增长而是不断地迅速地降落。
    由于通货膨胀逼使人民抢购囤积而造成的“市场繁荣”也是虚假的，它所表现的只是投机的繁荣。抢购囤积的结果，除有一部分粮食棉布等商品被人民分散保存外，还有大量商品囤积在投机商人和工商业家自己的手中，并不是已经被社会所消费。旧中国的金融业是促进投机的一个重大因素，在物价迅速高涨中，银行利息虽然跟着高涨，但常落在物价后面。因此许多投机商人以至一般工商业家，竞向银行贷款用于囤积物资。物价涨得越快，他们便赚钱越多，投机的风潮愈大，市场上便出现各货供不应求的虚假的繁荣。显然，在这种虚假繁荣的后面，正隐藏着严重的危机。如果通货膨胀愈转愈快，这种虚假繁荣虽能暂时保持；但人民的实际购买力跟着通货膨胀愈转愈小，这些投机囤积的商品便愈缩小其真正的市场。一旦物价高涨停止，这些投机囤积的商品必然没有销路，囤货多、负债多的投机商人就必然找不到出路，以至于破产。
    在这十二年通货膨胀中，中国的社会经济以至人民生活完全改变了面貌，变得十分畸形。首先是出现了大量的投机商人，他们完全脱离生产，专靠投机捣把追逐暴利，并享受着醉生梦死，奢侈堕落的生活。这种以“踢皮球”、“抢帽子”为职业的投机商人在通货膨胀期间愈来愈多，据估计在上海一地就有三十万人。围绕着这一群投机商人，又发展了许多奢侈浪费的职业。其次，是形成了一大批为投机服务的银行钱庄，它们的任务是吸收社会游资，供给投机资金，鼓励工商资本转向投机市场。第三，许多工商业家也被引诱上投机市场，他们往往用百分之九十的精力去追逐物价，调动头寸，从投机囤积来获取暴利；而只用百分之十的精力来照顾其日常的生产和业务经营。因此许多工商企业机构臃肿，经营腐败，完全依靠投机获利来维持。至于广大人民则是通货膨胀的牺牲者，特别是薪资劳动者，他们薪资的增加永远跟不上物价的上涨。但他们为求生存，同样不得不以微薄的薪资抢购和储存其必要的生活资料，如粮食和棉布等。乡村中普遍发生物物交易现象。其结果是城乡交换停滞，农民的生活更加陷入困境。
    十二年来的通货膨胀使整个社会产销和供求的规律陷于混乱，使旧中国经济的盲目性发展到了空前的高度。在通货膨胀中物价经常剧烈波动，完全脱离常轨。在正常的状态下，供求关系与物价变化常常互相影响，供求影响物价，物价又影响供求，这样使生产与消费能按经济规律恢复平衡。而在通货膨胀中，货币发行和抢购囤积强有力地刺激物价，淹没了正常的供求关系，这样使生产与消费完全脱节。某些商品尽管生产过剩，但市场上仍供不应求。实质上是购买力的低落，而表面上却呈现着购买力的“旺盛”。
    这种畸形的现象，在物价稳定之后，当然是不可能继续存在的。
    但是，全国人民的真实购买力是不但不会因物价稳定而消失，而且必将稳步地上升的。物价稳定，只是保护了人民的消费力量不再受通货膨胀的不断掠夺，决不会使这种消费力量反而降低。当然，为了把已经饱受掠夺的人民的购买力恢复到通货膨胀前的水平，还须经过相当长的休养生息的时间。但从通货膨胀转入物价稳定的初期所发生的特殊的滞销状态，即虚假的购买力突然退出市场而引起的滞销状态，却是会很快过去的。原因是：全国的囤货并不太多，无论粮食纱布都是如此；而各私营工厂的厂存也并不厚，这些顾客为了生活和生产的必需，在将囤货用完以后，在看到物价并不继续跌落以后，不能老是守着货币不买东西。事实上，全国的商品销售情况，在三、四月并不曾停止，而且从五月份起已经开始显露初步好转的象征了。而在全国的农业和工业的生产在可靠的基础上逐步恢复以后，就是说，在土地改革完成，工商业经过调整，和战争结束，军政费用大量缩减，国家和人民都能有计划地发展生产以后，中国几万万人民的真实的购买力，就必然会一步步地得到巨大的增长。
    一部分的工商业家过去和现在都对中央人民政府平衡财政收支，稳定金融物价的方针有些疑问。首先，物价稳定好，还是继续通货膨胀好？其次，在战争还未完全结束前，稳定金融物价是否过早？可否迟一、二年再来稳定？这次工商局长会议曾郑重讨论了这个问题，但所得到的结论是：物价必须稳定。今年既然有力量把物价稳定下来，应该力争在今年稳定物价。因为事实非常明显，通货膨胀已使中国经济遍体腐烂，我们决不应当迷恋这种毒害人民毒害生产的虚假的“繁荣”，而继续朝着毁灭前进。物价延至明年稳定，明年仍然会发生今年三、四月这样的困难，徒然使全国人民多受一年痛苦，使全国经济的元气多遭一年消耗，使将来的恢复更加困难。
    因此，我们应当在保持财政平衡，金融、物价稳定的基础上，向着未来的真实购买力日益增长的光明前途稳步前进。在这个康庄大道上，我们不应当有任何怀疑和动摇。
