Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th. According to Saigon news: The Vietnamese French authorities and the Bảo Đại puppet government have recently colluded with Kuomintang remnant bandit secret agents to wantonly arrest and kill overseas Chinese students. On the afternoon of April 22nd, Liu Ruisheng, the principal of the Fujian School in the Embankment of Vietnam, who was controlled by Kuomintang remnant bandit secret agents, and Luo Wei, a Chinese secret agent of the French colonial authorities, colluded with French detectives to arrest ten overseas Chinese students without any reason. The arrested students were beaten and threatened before being released. At the same time, Liu and Luo colluded with the reactionary authorities and ordered the suspension of the school's middle school department. On the morning of May 6th, all the students of the school's middle school department returned to school to request resumption of classes. Liu and Luo actually colluded with the police station and arrested more than seventy students, and beat several people on the spot. The arrested students were all subjected to humiliation and abuse, and some of those on the "blacklist" were even subjected to torture. One of the female students, Chen Peiji, was tortured to death. This matter has aroused widespread anger among overseas Chinese in Vietnam and local people. The Vietnamese Embankment Overseas Chinese Student Union has appealed to overseas Chinese from all walks of life and compatriots in the motherland on May 17th, requesting support.
