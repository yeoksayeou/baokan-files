Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: The following is the full text of the speech delivered by Shu Sheyu (Lao She), a member of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council and a writer, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 21st: Chairman, fellow members, ladies and gentlemen:

I have only been back in the motherland for half a year. It is a deep honor for me to be able to attend the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, to hear important reports, and to see our great leader and celebrities from all walks of life.

Since returning to the motherland, my work has been to continue studying literary creation and to participate in various literary and artistic activities in Beijing. Therefore, I understand that the current literary and artistic activities are based on Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. That is to say, literature and art must serve the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. With this principle, the unity of the literary and artistic circles has a driving force, because everyone's thoughts can be consistent, and feelings are easily harmonious. Everyone is willing to work together towards the same direction and the same task. The successive and smooth establishment of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and local federations is a clear proof. Today, because literary and artistic workers have clarified the task and purpose of literature and art, the sour old saying "writers despise each other" has been changed to "writers love each other."

Because of unity, the literary and artistic camp has also increased a lot of soldiers. At the recent Beijing Literary and Art Congress, representatives from the old opera circles and folk art circles accounted for almost a quarter of the total number of representatives; in addition, workers, students, and famous old opera amateurs also had representatives present. This proves that everyone has a clear understanding of the famous saying "unity is strength."

We have already seen in newspapers, publications, and theaters, many poems, novels, and dramas written by worker comrades; we have also seen writers enthusiastically participating in land reform and going to factories. All this makes us happy and excited. However, if everyone acts on their own, workers do workers' literature and art, and writers do writers' literature and art, without contact between each other, there will be no rapid progress. On the contrary, if writers and workers can unite like brothers, we believe that the progress of both sides will be rapid.

Regarding the issue of artists and the reform of old literature and art, the first issue is also one of unity. The new society has changed the social status of artists (from being despised to being valued) and raised their political consciousness. With this consciousness, their creativity will naturally develop. So, at this time, if they and the writers can unite and work together to reform old literature and art, making the best use of their talents, then it will achieve twice the result with half the effort, and the reform work can be done perfectly. Reforming old literature and art, and bringing forth new ideas, is a very important task at present. However, without a group, there is no way to start, and there is no way to become a universal movement.

Of course, under this principle of unity, we still have some difficulties that we cannot overcome ourselves, such as how can writers have closer contact with the vast number of young people? How to go to factories, rural areas, and troops in large numbers? How to regularly exchange knowledge and cooperate accurately with artists, and so on. This includes economic, time, work allocation, convenient transportation, and personnel transfer issues. I roughly raise these issues, hoping that all those who care about the popularization of culture will pay attention, give guidance and assistance, so that the work of popularizing culture can be carried out quickly and accurately. We have been and are continuing to carry out unity; we hope that the society will give us more encouragement, so that unity can blossom and bear plump fruit.

    舒舍予的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】政务院文教委员会委员、作家舒舍予（老舍）二十一日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言全文如下：主席，诸位委员，诸位先生：
    我回到祖国不过才有半年。这次能够列席人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议，听到各项重要的报告，见到我们伟大的领袖及各界的名人，我深深的引为荣幸。
    回到祖国来，我的工作是一面继续学习文艺创作，一面参加北京的各种文艺活动。因此，我理会到：当今的文艺活动是以毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲演为准则的。那就是说，文艺须为工农兵大众去服务。有了这个原则，文艺界的团结便有了原动力，因为大家的思想既能一致，感情便也容易融洽，都愿携手朝着同一个方向，同一个任务，前进。全国的与各处的文联能够相继顺利的成立便是个明证。今天，因为文艺工作者们弄清楚了文艺的任务与目的，所以那句酸溜溜的老话“文人相轻”已改为“文人相爱”了。
    因为团结，文艺的阵营也增多了不少的战士。在刚开过不久的北京市文代大会上，旧剧界与曲艺界的代表差不多占了代表总数的四分之一；此外，工人、学生、和旧剧的名票，也都有代表出席。这证明了，大家对“团结就是力量”这句名言已有了明确的认识。
    我们已经在报纸上，刊物上，戏园里，看见了不少工人同志们所写的诗歌，小说，与戏剧；也看见了文人们热诚的去参加土改，下工厂。这都使我们欢喜，兴奋。可是，大家若各自为政，工人干工人的文艺，文人干文人的文艺，彼此之间没有联系，便不会有迅速的进步。反之，文人与工人若能亲兄弟似的打成一片，我们相信，双方的进步必会突飞猛进的。
    关于艺人问题和旧文艺的改革问题，首先也是一个团结问题。新社会改变了艺人们的社会地位（从被轻视变为被重视），提高了他们的政治觉悟。有了这觉悟，他们的创造力是自然会发展的。那么，在这时候，他们和文人们若能团结起来，各尽所长的共同去搞旧文艺的改革，那才会收到事半功倍的效果，才能把改革工作做得美满。改革旧文艺，推陈出新，是当前的一件极重要的工作。可是，没有团体便没法动手，没法成为一种普遍的运动。
    当然，在这大家团结的原则下，我们还有些不是我们自己所能克服的困难，像文人们如何与广大的青年们更密切的联系？如何大量的到工厂，农村，与部队里去？如何经常的与艺人们交换知识与确切的合作等等。这里包含着经济，时间，工作的分配，交通的便利，人事的调动，种种问题。我糙糙的提出这一些问题，希望一切关心文化普及问题的人士，加以注意，予以指导与援助，好教文化普及的工作迅速而确切的展开。我们已经，也还继续着进行，团结；我们盼望社会上给我们更多的鼓励，使团结由开花而结成肥硕的果实。
