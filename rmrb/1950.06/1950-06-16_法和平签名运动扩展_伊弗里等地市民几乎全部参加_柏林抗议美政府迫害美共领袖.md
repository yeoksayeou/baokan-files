Xinhua News Agency, June 15th dispatch from Paris: The peace signature campaign in France continues to achieve new successes. For example, by June 12th, the Pas-de-Calais department had already collected 500,000 signatures. In the coastal town of Brêmes in the same department, 29,000 residents had signed, accounting for 65% of the town's population. In Gennevilliers, Seine, 24,000 out of 25,000 residents had signed. In Ivry-sur-Seine, which has a population of 42,500, 98% of the people have signed the declaration.

　　The "Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom" in Pas-de-Calais has challenged the same organization in Seine, guaranteeing to collect one million signatures before July 14th.

　　The Fifth National Congress of the French National Association of Former Deportees, Concentration Camp Inmates, and Resistance Fighters, which closed in Paris on June 11th, passed a resolution calling on all French patriots to sign the declaration of the World Peace Congress.

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 15th dispatch from Berlin, June 12th: On June 11th, representatives of all strata of Berlin's population held a grand rally in the Friedrichstadt Palace to protest against the US government's persecution of the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party.

　　Speakers at the meeting included: Diether, First Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation of Greater Berlin; Kajamin, Deputy Dean of the Supreme Court of the German Democratic Republic; Hoffmann, Second Secretary of the Greater Berlin Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany; Zweig, a writer; and Eisler, Director of the News Bureau of the German Democratic Republic.

　　Kajamin emphasized at the meeting that the American judicial organs, serving monopoly capital, are paving the way for American fascism. Hoffmann pointed out that the best contribution the German people can make to demanding the release of the American Communist leaders and other American peace fighters is to work harder to collect signatures for the peace declaration.

　　Finally, the大会 unanimously passed a resolution expressing firm protest against the American persecution of peace fighters, and demanding the immediate release of the eleven American Communist leaders.

　　This conference was jointly organized by the "Committee to Rescue Those Persecuted by American Reactionaries," the National Front of Democratic Germany, the Free German Trade Union Federation, the Free German Youth League, the Cultural Association, the German Democratic Lawyers Association, the Association of Nazi Victims, and the German Democratic Women's League.

    柏林抗议美政府迫害美共领袖
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国的和平签名运动，继续获得新的成就。例如，到六月十二日为止，加来海峡省已经征得了五十万人签名。该省的海滨布伦已有二万九千名居民签名，占该城人口百分之六十五。在塞纳省珍尼维利埃的二万五千名居民中，已有二万四千人签名。拥有人口四万二千五百人的塞纳河畔的伊弗里已有百分之九十八的人民在宣言上面签名。
    加来海峡省的“争和平与自由战士协会”并已向塞纳省的同样组织挑战，保证在七月十四日以前征得一百万人的签名。
    六月十一日在巴黎闭幕的法国前流放犯、集中营犯与抵抗运动者全国协会的第五次大会，曾通过决议，号召法国所有的爱国志士都在世界和大常委会的宣言上签名。
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林十二日讯：六月十一日，柏林各阶层的民众代表在腓特烈斯塔得宫中举行了盛大的集会，抗议美国政府迫害美国共产党的十一位领袖。
    会上演说的人有：大柏林自由德国工会联合会第一主席狄特、德意志民主共和国最高法院副院长卡雅明、德国统一社会党大柏林委员会第二书记霍夫曼、作家斯威格和德意志民主共和国新闻局长艾斯勒。
    卡雅明在会上强调称：为垄断资本服务的美国司法机关，正为美国法西斯主义铺平道路。霍夫曼指出：德国人民对于要求释放美共领袖和美国其他和平战士的最佳贡献，就是更努力地征集和平宣言的签名。
    最后，大会一致通过决议，表示坚决抗议美国迫害和平战士，要求立刻释放美共十一位领袖。
    这次大会是由“营救被美国反动派迫害者委员会”、民主德国全国阵线、自由德国工会联合会、自由德国青年联盟、文化联盟、德国民主律师公会、纳粹受难者协会和德国民主妇女联盟共同组织的。
