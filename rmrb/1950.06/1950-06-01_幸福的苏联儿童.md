　　Happy Soviet Children

　　Soviet children are most valued by the state. Babies can enter nurseries 42 days after birth, kindergartens from four to seven years old, schools at seven, and join the Young Pioneers from eleven to sixteen. They grow into new people under the education of the socialist system and culture.

　　The state protects mothers with many children. Mothers with three children can receive a subsidy of 400 rubles, mothers with seven children can receive 2,500 rubles, and mothers with ten or more children can receive 5,000 rubles. From 1944 to 1950, the state spent 16.5 billion rubles helping pregnant women and mothers. The Soviet Union has 30,750 "Hero Mothers" and more than 2.77 million mothers who have received the "Maternal Glory" Order and the "Maternity Medal."

　　The capacity of Soviet fixed nurseries will increase to 1,251,000 this year, and the capacity of kindergartens will increase to 2,260,000, a twofold increase compared to 1940. Last year, the government passed a resolution to further expand children's institutions and maternity homes. Now, every factory with more than 500 female workers has a kindergarten. In rural areas, seasonal kindergartens and nurseries set up during the busy farming season accommodate 4 million children.

　　Children are protected by the state's network of child health and welfare agencies. Milk stations, health camps, children's medical consulting rooms, children's hospitals, and children's clinics are set up throughout the country. In the Russian Federation alone, sanatoriums can accommodate 25,000 children at the same time.

　　Soviet children generally receive education. Compulsory education is implemented for all school-age children (over seven years old). It is a seven-year system in towns and a four-year system in villages.

　　The state has widely established children's homes, children's palaces, clubs, children's technology stations, juvenile science halls, art galleries, theaters, and cinemas for children, and publishes children's newspapers and pictorial magazines.

　　The Soviet Union currently has 160 children's theaters, 500 music and art schools, and 16 dance schools. The Soviet system provides broad possibilities for the development of children's talents.

　　There are now more than 1,300 children's libraries in the Soviet Union. Since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has published 850 million books for children; in the post-war period alone, 1,300 kinds of books have been published, with a print run of 100 million copies. It is common for children's favorite books to be published in editions of 200,000 to 400,000 copies.

　　The Young Pioneers now have more than 13 million members. Organized life and training have made Young Pioneers excellent citizens. During the war, they worked in the fields, collected scrap metal, and donated money to buy tanks and planes. Many children even directly participated in the fighting. Three thousand children were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, and thousands of children received medals and awards.

　　The summer vacation for Soviet children has now begun. This summer, the summer camps sponsored by the Soviet Trade Union will accommodate 2.55 million schoolchildren. They will spend a pleasant holiday in the forests and flowers.

　　幸福的苏联儿童
    苏联的儿童最受国家重视。婴儿出生四十二天，便可以进托儿所，四岁到七岁进幼稚园，七岁进学校，十一岁到十六岁可以参加少年先锋队。他们在社会主义制度和文化的教养下，成长为崭新的人。
    国家保护多子的母亲。三个孩子的母亲可领四百卢布的津贴，七个孩子的母亲可领二千五百卢布，十个孩子以上的母亲，可以领五千卢布。从一九四四年到五○年，国家帮助孕妇和母亲们已用去了一百六十五亿卢布。苏联有三万零七百五十个“英雄母亲”，有二百七十七万以上的母亲，获得“母性之光”章及“母性奖章”。
    苏联的固定托儿所的收容名额，今年将增加到一百二十五万一千，幼稚园名额将增加到二百二十六万，比一九四○年增加两倍。去年政府通过了进一步扩充儿童机关及产妇之家的决议，现在每个有五百女工以上的工厂，都有幼稚园。在农村里，农忙时期设立的季节性幼稚园和托儿所，收容儿童四百万人。
    儿童受国家儿童保健福利机关网的保护。全国各地都设有给乳站、健康营、儿童医药顾问室、儿童医院、儿童门诊所等。仅在俄罗斯联邦境内，各地疗养院即能同时收容二万五千儿童。
    苏联儿童普遍受教育。全体学龄儿童（七岁以上）都实行强迫教育。在城镇中是七年制，在乡村中是四年制。
    国家给儿童广泛设立了儿童之家、儿童宫、俱乐部、儿童技术站、少年科学馆、艺术馆、剧院、电影院，并且出版儿童报和画报杂志。
    苏联现有一百六十所儿童剧院，五百所音乐和艺术学校，十六所舞蹈学校。苏维埃制度提供了发展儿童天才的广泛可能性。
    苏联全国现有一千三百余所儿童图书馆。从十月革命以来，苏联已为儿童出版了八亿五千万册书；仅在战后时期，就已出版了一千三百种书，印行了一亿册。受儿童欢迎的书，每种发行二十万到四十万册是常事。
    少年先锋队现在有一千三百余万队员。有组织的生活与训练已使少先队员成为优秀的公民。在战争时期，他们下田工作，收集废铁，献金购买坦克飞机。许多儿童更直接参加了战斗。有三千儿童荣膺了苏联英雄的称号，成千的儿童获得了勋章和奖章。
    目前苏联儿童的暑假已经开始。今夏苏联工会主办的夏令营，将容纳二百五十五万学校儿童。他们将在森林和花卉之中度过愉快的假期。
