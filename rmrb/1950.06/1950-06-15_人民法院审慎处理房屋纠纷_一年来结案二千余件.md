　　People's Court Prudently Handles Housing Disputes
    Over Two Thousand Cases Concluded in One Year
    [Beijing News Agency Report] From March 18, 1949, to May 20, 1950, the Beijing People's Court received a total of 2,542 housing rental cases, accounting for more than 24 percent of all civil cases. Among these, lawsuits initiated by landlords accounted for 97 percent, while those initiated by tenants accounted for 3 percent.

    Among the 2,302 cases that have been concluded, the majority are lawsuits caused by tenants paying low rent, being in arrears with rent, forcibly renting, or refusing to vacate. This shows that the main problem in implementing the urban housing policy at present is how to achieve reasonable rent and protect the property rights of landlords.

    Over the past fourteen months, as a result of the prudent and correct handling by the People's Court, lawsuits involving rent arrears and excessively low rents have generally been resolved. However, in some mediation processes, some individual cadres have not proceeded from the long-term interests of the broad masses of citizens, but have one-sidedly "taken care" of the interests of tenants, resulting in disputes not being resolved reasonably.

    After the lawsuit is established through judgment or mediation, the parties generally fulfill the agreement as scheduled. However, there are also cases where one party does not fulfill the agreement, and the other party files an application for enforcement with the court, which is mostly due to the tenant's failure to pay rent or vacate the house according to the judgment or mediation. Although this situation is a minority, its impact on undermining the government's housing policy is serious.

    In order to reasonably resolve housing rental disputes, the Beijing People's Court announced the "Measures for Compulsory Enforcement of Housing Rental Disputes" on June 2 (already published in the city's newspapers). Compulsory enforcement will be carried out against the few who fail to comply with court judgments, but reasonable and due care will still be given to tenants who do have actual difficulties.

### 人民法院审慎处理房屋纠纷  一年来结案二千余件

　　人民法院审慎处理房屋纠纷
    一年来结案二千余件
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民法院自一九四九年三月十八日至一九五○年五月二十日止共收房屋租赁案件二千五百四十二件，占全部民事案件的百分之二十四强，其中，由出租人起诉的占百分之九十七，由承租人起诉的占百分之三。
    在已结案的二千三百零二件中，多数是由于承租人的低租，欠租，强租，拒让而引起的诉讼，这说明目前贯彻城市房屋政策的主要问题是如何实现合理房租并保障房主的产权。
    十四个月来，由于人民法院审慎、正确处理的结果，欠租、过分低租的诉讼一般都得到了解决。但在某些调解过程中，也有个别干部不是从广大市民的长远利益出发，而是片面“照顾”房客的利益，致使纠纷不能合理解决。
    诉讼经判决或调解成立之后，当事人一般都能如约履行，但也有因一方不履行，他方向法院提出执行申请的，这多是由承租人不依判决、调解交租或腾房。这种情形虽是少数，但其破坏政府房屋政策的影响却是严重的。
    京市人民法院为了合理解决房屋租赁纠纷，乃于六月二日公布了“房屋租赁纠纷强制执行办法”（已载本市各报），对少数不履行法院判决者，决强制执行，但对确有实际困难的房客，仍给以合理和应有的照顾。（朱明）
