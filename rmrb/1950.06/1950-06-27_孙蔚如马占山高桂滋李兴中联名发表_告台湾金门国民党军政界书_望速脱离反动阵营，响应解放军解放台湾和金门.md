Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: Beijing Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast on the evening of the 25th of this month a letter to the Kuomintang military and political circles in Taiwan and Kinmen from Sun Weiru, former Commander-in-Chief of the Sixth War Zone of the Kuomintang, and others. The full text is as follows:

Fellow friends in the Kuomintang military and political circles in Taiwan and Kinmen:

　　Hainan Island and the Zhoushan Islands have been liberated one after another. This proves that Chiang Kai-shek's boasted "strong defense" is absolutely unable to withstand the offensive of the People's Liberation Army. Neither American equipment nor the vast ocean can save Chiang Kai-shek from his doomed fate. The liberation of Taiwan and Kinmen is imminent.

　　Of course, your hearts today must be very conflicted and painful, always hesitating and lingering, feeling unable to find a way out. In fact, the way out has long been placed before you, but your determination is not enough. In the past, you were deceived by Chiang Kai-shek and followed him to Taiwan and Kinmen. Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy is nothing more than to use you to make a final struggle, to use you as a tool to maintain his dying regime. This conspiracy is destined to fail. When Taiwan and Kinmen are liberated, the Kuomintang reactionary regime will be completely declared extinct. Where will you run to then? American imperialism will never take you in! Therefore, if you do not quickly break away from the reactionary camp, you will inevitably head towards the path of destruction. You should all understand this by now.

　　Until now, because you do not understand the situation in the new China, and you have been subjected to years of rumor-mongering propaganda by Chiang Kai-shek, it is inevitable that you have some doubts. We have had this kind of mentality in the past. But in the past year, what we have seen and personally experienced has made us deeply feel that our past ideas were completely wrong. All concerns are completely unnecessary. People like us, who have been in the reactionary camp for so many years and served Chiang Kai-shek, always feel sorry for the country and the people. However, Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the people of the whole country are so magnanimous, based on the spirit of "benevolence," not only do they not hold us accountable for the past, but they also help us progress in every way, enabling us to gradually establish new ideas and new styles.

　　Today, the new China is full of light and hope. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the entire people are working hard to carry out national construction. Inflation has been eliminated, prices are unprecedentedly stable, and people's lives have basic guarantees. Everyone has the opportunity to work and can fully发挥 their abilities to serve the people. All of this is something you would never have imagined.

　　Friends, the final moment has arrived. I hope you will resolutely break away from the reactionary camp and respond to the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Taiwan and Kinmen. Don't hesitate any longer, don't linger any longer. If you lose this last opportunity, you will surely regret it endlessly in the future. Your future is bright, or dark, new life, or destruction, it is up to you to decide.

　　Former Commander-in-Chief of the Sixth War Zone of the Kuomintang, Sun Weiru; Former Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Advance Army of the Kuomintang, Ma Zhanshan; Former Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the First War Zone of the Kuomintang, Gao Guizi; Former Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Army Group of the Kuomintang, Li Xingzhong.

    告台湾金门国民党军政界书
    望速脱离反动阵营，响应解放军解放台湾和金门
    【新华社二十六日讯】北京中央人民广播电台于本月二十五日晚广播前国民党第六战区司令长官孙蔚如等告台湾、金门国民党军政界书，全文如下：台湾金门国民党军政界的朋友们：
    海南岛和舟山群岛已经先后解放了。这证明了蒋介石所夸耀的“坚强防御”，是绝对经不起解放大军进攻的，不管美式配备也罢，汪洋大海也罢，都挽救不了蒋介石的死亡命运。台湾金门的解放，已在眼前了。
    当然你们今天的内心一定是非常矛盾和痛苦的，老是犹豫徘徊，觉得找不到出路。其实，出路早就摆在你们的面前，只是你们的决心不够罢了。过去，你们受了蒋介石的欺骗，跟着他跑到台湾金门。蒋介石的阴谋，无非是想利用你们来作最后的挣扎，想把你们当作工具来维持他那垂死的政权。这一阴谋，是注定了要失败的。等到台湾金门解放以后，国民党反动政权便彻底宣告灭亡，那时候你们又往那里跑？美帝国主义是决不会收留你们的！因此，你们如果不赶快脱离反动阵营，那么就势必走向毁灭的道路。这一点，想来你们现在都应该明白的了。
    直到目前为止，你们由于对新中国的情形不了解，加以受了蒋介石多年的造谣宣传，难免存在着一些疑虑。这种心理，我们过去也曾有过。但这一年来，我们亲眼看到和亲自经历的，使我们深切感到过去的想法完全错误。一切的顾虑是完全不必要。像我们这样的人，以前在反动阵营里那么多年，替蒋介石服过务，自己总觉得对不起国家人民。可是，毛主席、中国共产党和全国人民却那么的宽大，本“与人为善”的精神，非但对我们不究既往，而且还处处帮助我们进步，使我们逐步的建立起新的思想和新的作风。
    今天，在新中国到处充满了光明和希望。全体人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，正在努力进行国家的建设工作。通货膨胀已经消灭，物价空前稳定，人民生活有了基本的保障。每一个人都有工作的机会，并且可以充分发挥他的能力，来为人民服务。这一切，在你们是万万想不到的。
    朋友们，最后的一刻已经来到了。希望你们毅然决然的脱离反动阵营，响应人民解放军解放台湾金门。不要再犹豫了，再徘徊了。失去了这最后的一个机会，将来一定会后悔无穷的。你们的前途是光明、是黑暗、是新生、是毁灭，就在你们自己抉择了。
    前国民党第六战区司令长官孙蔚如、前国民党东北挺进军总司令马占山、前国民党第一战区副司令长官高桂滋、前国民党第四集团军总司令李兴中。
