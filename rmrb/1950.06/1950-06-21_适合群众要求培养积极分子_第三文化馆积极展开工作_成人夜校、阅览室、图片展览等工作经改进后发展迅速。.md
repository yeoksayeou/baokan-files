　　Suitable for Mass Needs, Cultivating Activists
    Third Cultural Center Actively Expands Work
    Adult Night Schools, Reading Rooms, Photo Exhibitions, and other work have developed rapidly after improvements.
    [Reported by this newspaper] The experience of the Municipal Third Cultural Center over the past six months has proven that the successful development of mass education work must grasp the ideological situation of the masses, suit the actual needs of the masses, take into account the difficult conditions of the masses, and provide as much convenience as possible for the masses to read. It is also necessary to cultivate activists as the backbone to promote the broad masses.
    The public lectures initially held by the center were not very much in line with the current needs of the masses, resulting in less enthusiastic attendance. Later, when it was understood that the masses generally had the ideological question of "whether the Third World War is about to happen," the center held a public lecture on answering this question, and the number of listeners more than doubled compared to usual, laying the foundation for future lectures. The center learned that the masses had many difficult problems in reading newspapers, so it set up a "Reading Q&A Column" to answer various questions. Every day, there were many readers watching and copying in front of the "Reading Q&A Column." Later, to meet the needs of readers, a "Clipping Column" was set up, which daily clipped and posted important materials, policies, and laws from newspapers, making it clear to readers at a glance, and was generally welcomed by the masses. The selection of books is also based on the requirements of the masses. As a result, the number of people coming to the library increased, and according to statistics in mid-May, the average daily number had exceeded 350. The center's adult night school was also established according to the learning requirements of the masses. The center's original literacy class had only 30 students. Due to the efforts of the center's teachers, various methods suitable for students' requirements were used for teaching, and the number of students gradually increased, and the students' requirements had exceeded literacy, so the adult night school was expanded. Now there are 284 students.
    At first, the cadres of the center relied only on their own observations to understand the ideological work of the masses, and gained little. When digging the Beihai, activists among the night school students of the center reflected many citizens' views on this matter, inspiring the cadres of the center to investigate the ideological situation of the masses from the student activists. The center then formed a "Social Situation Symposium" with activists from the night school students in the district. Through this meeting, many real thoughts of the masses were understood. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "May 1st" report, the center learned in the symposium that the masses had many different understandings and ideological concerns, and therefore, in response to this situation, adopted forms such as women's symposiums and public lectures, and through activists, carried out publicity and education to the broad masses, and achieved greater results. After the Standing Committee of the China Peace Congress issued a call to defend world peace and ban atomic weapons, the center first carried out publicity in the night school. Within ten minutes, all 200 students signed their names. Many student activists also automatically helped the center's cadres to carry out street propaganda and home visits, explaining the significance of the signature, and mobilized a total of 4,155 people to sign their names. During the "June 1st" Children's Rights Protection signature campaign, the parents of 7,681 children were mobilized to sign their names within three days through night school students. Ren Shuhua, a student in Class A, visited and explained door to door, and she alone mobilized 1,020 people. In the center's various publicity and education work to the broad masses, the activists among the night school students became a powerful assistant to the center's cadres and played a huge role in promoting mass education work.
    The center's photo exhibitions used to be held in the center. The site is in a hutong, and the broad masses of working people and ordinary citizens rarely can run from far away to the center to visit. Therefore, despite all the efforts to promote and mobilize students to visit collectively, the most people in one day did not exceed 600. Later, the center came up with the idea of ​​street exhibitions, and cooperated with the 10th police station to hold a street photo exhibition in the Taiping Lake area, a gathering place for working people in the southwest corner, for three days, with more than 2,000 visitors each day; then it was moved to Xidan North Street for three days, with 6,000 visitors each day. Also, the center's reading room, in order to take care of the current conditions that working people cannot have time to go to the cultural center to read, adopted the method of "bringing books to the door," in addition to setting up six reading stations, and also handling book lending. In May, the number of people borrowing books reached more than 4,200, of which workers and general working people accounted for more than 80%. The center's reading room also plans to organize a large number of reading groups in June and July to gradually promote and help the learning of the broad masses of working people.

　　适合群众要求培养积极分子
    第三文化馆积极展开工作
    成人夜校、阅览室、图片展览等工作经改进后发展迅速。
    【本报讯】市立第三文化馆半年来的工作经验证明：群众教育工作的顺利开展，必须要掌握群众的思想情况，适合群众实际需要，照顾群众的困难条件，尽量给群众阅读方便。并须培养积极分子作为推动广大群众的骨干。
    该馆起先举行的大众讲座，因为有些是不太合乎群众的当前需要，致听讲者不够踊跃。后来当了解到群众普遍有着“第三次大战是否要发生”的思想问题时，该馆举行了关于解答这一问题的大众讲座，听讲者比平常增多一倍以上；并为以后举行讲座打下了基础。该馆了解到群众在读报中有不少疑难问题，即设立了《阅读问答栏》，解答各种问题。每天《阅读问答栏》前总有很多读者观看与抄写。后又适应读者需要，设立了《剪报栏》，每日将报纸上重要材料政策法令等剪集贴出，使读者一目了然，得到群众普遍欢迎。选购图书也都依据群众要求。因之来馆阅览者日众，据五月中旬统计，平均每日已超过三百五十人。该馆的成人夜校也是根据群众的学习要求而举办的。该馆原有的识字班仅有学生三十人，因该馆教员的努力，运用各种适合学生要求的方法进行教学，学生人数日渐增多，而且学生的要求已超过了识字，因之扩大成立了成人夜校。现在已有学生二百八十四人。
    该馆干部最初对于了解群众思想工作，只靠干部们自己的见闻，所得无多。及至挖北海时，该馆夜校学生中的积极分子反映了许多市民对这事的看法，启示了该馆干部从学生积极分子中调查群众思想情况。该馆乃将该区各夜校学生中的积极分子，组成“社情座谈会”。通过这个会，了解了许多群众的真实思想。当婚姻法及刘少奇同志“五一”报告发表后，该馆就在座谈会中获悉了群众中有许多不同的认识和思想顾虑，因而针对这种情况，采用了妇女座谈、大众讲座等形式，并通过积极分子，向广大群众进行宣传教育，获得了较大效果。中国和平大会常委会发出保卫世界和平，禁用原子武器的号召后，该馆首先在夜校中进行宣传，在十几分钟内，二百余学生全体签了名。许多学生中的积极分子，并自动帮助该馆干部进行街头宣传和家庭访问，解说签名意义，共发动了四千一百五十五人签了名。“六一”节保卫儿童权利签名运动，也通过夜校学生，三天内发动了七千六百八十一个儿童的父母签了名。甲班学生任淑华挨户访问解释，她一人就发动了一千零二十人。在该馆向广大群众进行各种宣传教育工作中，夜校学生中的积极分子，成了该馆干部的有力助手，对群众教育工作起了巨大的推动作用。
    该馆的图片展览，过去一向在馆内举行。馆址在胡同内，广大劳动人民和一般市民很少能从远处跑到馆中参观。因之历次的展览，虽用尽力量宣传与发动学生集体参观，最多一天也没有超过六百人。后来该馆想出街头展览的办法，乃与第十派出所合作，在西南角劳动人民集聚地太平湖一带，举行街头图片展览三天，每天阅览者均超过两千人；其后又移至西单北大街展览三天，每天有六千人参观。又该馆阅览室，为照顾目前劳动人民还不能有到文化馆阅览的时间等条件，采用了“把图书送上门”的办法，除设立阅览站六处外，并办理向外借书。五月份借书的人数达四千二百余人，其中工人及一般劳动人民占百分之八十以上。该馆阅览室并拟于六、七两月大量组织读书组，以逐渐普遍地推动与帮助广大劳动人民的学习。
