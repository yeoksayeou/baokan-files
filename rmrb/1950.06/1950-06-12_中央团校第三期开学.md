Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The opening ceremony of the third session of students at the Central Youth League School of the New Democratic Youth League was held on the 10th. Over a thousand students and staff attended. Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League and Principal of the Central Youth League School, attended and spoke. The Central Youth League School was founded in the summer of 1948 with the purpose of conducting education in the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and studying the work and knowledge of the Youth League, in order to train cadres for the Youth League. The first session had 665 students, most of whom were youth work cadres from various liberated areas, and a small number were activists from the middle school student movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The second session began last August with 1,294 students, including local cadres, industrial workers, students, and young intellectuals. Most of the graduates from the two sessions have been assigned to various parts of the country to participate in the middle and lower-level leadership work of the Youth League. The students in this session are all drawn from the Youth League's prefectural committees, county standing committees, district committees in large cities, as well as propaganda and education cadres from various regions. The training period is eight months. The educational content mainly focuses on the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, the issues of the Chinese revolution, the Party Constitution, the construction of the Youth League, as well as various policy education, current affairs education, and courses related to propaganda work.
