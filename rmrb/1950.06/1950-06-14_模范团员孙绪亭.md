Red List

　　Model League Member Sun Xuting
    Lu Shuyi
    League member Sun Xuting is a oil pressing worker at the Huimin Oil Mill in Dongning, Songjiang Province, Northeast China. This factory is considered very important in Dongning, as all the streets and villages eat the soybean oil produced by this factory. There are more than thirty workers in the entire factory, all working enthusiastically, and Sun Xuting is the most active among them. Therefore, at this year's "May Day" County Model Worker Conference, he received the glorious title of First-Class Model and wore a big red flower.
    I. Not Afraid of Cold Water
    In February of this year, Dongning Street experienced a power outage that would take twenty to thirty days to restore. As a result, the supply of soybean oil to the entire street became difficult. The factory called for the repair of the factory's large steam boiler. Sun Xuting was the first to respond to this call. However, he encountered difficulties from the beginning: to provide water for the boiler, the well needed to be repaired. At that time, however, the well opening was frozen, and someone needed to go into the water to install the water faucet; but no one dared to go down. In order to complete the task as soon as possible, Sun Xuting, unafraid of the difficulties, took off his clothes and went into the water to install the water faucet. However, some of the water faucets were not working well. When the water gate was opened, the water flowed out very quickly, freezing on the ground in a short time. There was nothing to block the faucet opening. If it was not blocked, not only would the soybeans be lost, but work could not be done. The water was gushing out continuously. Everyone was helpless. Sun Xuting saw that there was nothing to block the opening, so he took off his new cotton coat and stuffed it into the faucet opening.
    II. Improving the Oil Press
    The factory had few tools, so work was divided into two shifts. Sun Xuting was assigned to the night shift. The day shift used an oil press that produced less oil, but no one had thought of a way to improve it. Sun Xuting's shift, however, used a good oil press. When he heard this news, he switched the oil presses; his shift used the one that did not work well. In order to make this press produce as much oil as the good one, he put in some effort, always watching the oil press while working: Why is it producing less oil? During breaks, he also studied the problems with the oil press. As a result, he realized that the oil lever was too short and could not apply enough force. When he was off duty, he did not go to sleep, but found a large iron bar and spent two days making a new oil lever. After a night of testing, it worked very well. Previously, each shift produced four hundred and a few jin of oil, but now each shift can produce more than four hundred and forty jin, an increase of forty jin compared to before. The daily output of the two shifts can be increased by seventy or eighty jin in total.
    III. Caring for the Factory
    During the Spring Festival, the factory was closed, and no one was on night watch. Sun Xuting still remembered the words "Prevent fire and theft, stay vigilant, do not be careless," so he himself did the night watch every night. In April, it was about to rain, and the torch house in the square had no roof. If it rained, the electric rollers would be damaged. During his rest time, he took the lead in encouraging everyone to carry the electric rollers back for safekeeping.
    IV. Taking Care of Work
    One day, he had just finished his shift and was very tired, and should have gone to sleep. But it happened that a worker on the day shift was sick and could not work. The oil pressing work could not be done without one person, and there were so few people that there was no one available. What could be done? Sun Xuting, who should have been sleeping, got out of bed, put on his clothes, and went to work with the day shift workers. Work was therefore not stopped.

　　模范团员孙绪亭
    卢树义
    团员孙绪亭是东北松江省东宁惠民油房的打油工。这个工厂在东宁说起来很重要，全街各屯都吃着这工厂制出来的豆油。全厂有三十多名工友，干的都是那么起劲，孙绪亭是当中最积极的一个。所以在今年“五一”节全县工人劳模大会上，得到头等模范的光荣称号，带上了大红花。
    一、不怕水凉
    今年二月间，东宁街上停电了，要二、三十天才能恢复，因此，全街豆油供给，就发生了困难。厂方号召将本厂的大汽炉修复起来。孙绪亭首先响应了这一号召。但他一开始就遇到了困难：要使锅炉有水用，需要把水井修理好。然而那时井口都冻了，需要下到水里去才能按上水笼头；可是谁也不敢下去。孙绪亭为了早日完成任务，不怕困难，把衣服脱下来下到水里把水笼头按上了。但是有些水笼头不好使，一开水门，水就很急的流出来，在地上一会儿就冻了。又没有什么东西堵水笼口。若是不堵住的话，不但豆子受损失，就是活也没法干。水哗哗的向外一个劲的直流。大家都没办法，孙绪亭一看没什么东西堵，就把自己新棉衣从身上脱下来，把水笼口塞上。
    二、改进打油榨
    工厂里的工具少，所以作工分两班。孙绪亭分在晚班。日班使的油榨出油少，但谁也没想出什么办法改进它。孙绪亭那班却使着一个好的油榨。他知道了这个消息，就把油榨调换过来了；他那班使那个不好使的榨来工作。为了使这个榨也能和好的一样出油，他下了些功夫，工作的时候老是瞅着油榨：为什么少出油呢？到了休息的时候，他也研究着油榨的毛病。结果他看出油杠太短，用不上劲。到休班的时候，他不去睡觉，自己找了一个大铁杠，费了两天工夫，作出一个新油杠。经过一夜的试验，很好使。以前每班一个油榨出四百零几斤，现在一班能出四百四十多斤啦，比以前增加了四十斤油。一天两班共能增加七八十斤的产量。
    三、爱护工厂
    过年的时候，工厂放假，没有人打更了。孙绪亭还记着“防火防盗，提高警惕，不要麻痹”的几句话，因此他自己每天晚上打更。四月间天快要下雨啦，在广场上的火炬房没有顶盖，若是一下雨电滚就得受损失。他在工余休息时候带头推动大家，把电滚抬回保存起来了。
    四、照顾工作
    有一天他刚下班，十分疲乏，本该睡觉了。可是恰好日班有一个工友生病，不能上班，而榨油工作少一个人就不行，人又那么少，没有一个闲人，这可怎么办呢？本该睡觉的孙绪亭，从炕上爬起来，穿上衣裳又跟日班工人上班去了。工作因而未停。
