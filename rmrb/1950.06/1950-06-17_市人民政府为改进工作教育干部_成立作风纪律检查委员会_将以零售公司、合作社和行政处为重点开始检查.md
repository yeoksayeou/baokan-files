[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government has now established a Work Style and Discipline Inspection Committee, focusing on three units—retail companies, cooperatives, and administrative offices—for initial inspections. After gaining experience, a comprehensive inspection campaign will be launched across all units. Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing and Director of the People's Supervisory Committee, serves as the Chairman of the Work Style and Discipline Inspection Committee, with Xue Zizheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, as the Vice Chairman. On the 14th, Deputy Mayor Wu convened a mobilization meeting for all Municipal Government cadres regarding the work style and discipline inspection, elucidating the purpose and content of this inspection campaign, as well as the steps for its implementation. He stated that the purpose of this inspection campaign is to improve work, educate cadres, promote achievements, and correct mistakes. The achievements and merits of the Municipal People's Government's work are undeniable, but there are also shortcomings and errors. Some of these relate to the work style of cadres, namely, bureaucracy and commandism; others are the individual disciplinary violations of some cadres, that is, oppressing the masses and engaging in corruption. Although these are only the actions of a few cadres, the damage to the People's Government is extremely serious. The content of this inspection campaign is to oppose four things: bureaucracy, commandism, oppressing the masses, and corruption. The goal is that through this inspection, the connection between the people and the government will be closer, the work efficiency of the People's Government itself will be further improved, and the purity of the People's Government will be maintained.

The Work Style and Discipline Inspection Committee has decided to organize Work Style and Discipline Inspection Sub-Committees in various bureaus of the Municipal Government, with branches organized in large affiliated units and groups organized in small units, in order to conduct this campaign in a guided manner. Currently, the three key units are studying documents and conducting inspections in conjunction with summarizing their work. This is expected to conclude within approximately three weeks. During this period, other units will also begin reading documents.

　　市人民政府为改进工作教育干部
    成立作风纪律检查委员会
    将以零售公司、合作社和行政处为重点开始检查
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府现已组成作风纪律检查委员会，并以零售公司、合作社和行政处等三个单位为重点，首先进行检查；等到取得经验以后，即在各单位展开普遍的检查运动。作风纪律检查委员会以北京市人民政府副市长兼人民监察委员会主任吴晗为主任委员，市府秘书长薛子正为副主任委员。吴副市长于十四日召集市府全体干部举行了作风纪律检查动员大会，对这一次检查运动的目的与内容，和进行的步骤加以阐明，他说：这次检查运动的目的，是在改进工作，教育干部、发扬成绩、改正错误。市人民政府的工作成绩和优点是肯定的，但是同时也有缺点和错误，一部分是属于干部作风的，即官僚主义和强迫命令；另一部分是个别干部违反纪律的行为，即欺压群众和贪污腐化。这虽然仅仅是部分干部的行为，但是对于人民政府的损害，却极其严重。这次检查运动的内容，也就是反对官僚主义、强迫命令、欺压群众和贪污腐化等四项，以期经过这次检查，使人民与政府的联系更加密切，使人民政府本身的工作效率更提高一步，并保持人民政府的纯洁。
    作风纪律检查委员会决定在市府各局组织作风纪律检查分会，其附属大单位组织支会，小单位组织小组，以便有领导地展开这一运动。现在三个重点单位正在学习文件，结合总结工作进行检查，大约三个星期以内可以结束。在此期间，其他单位亦即开始进行阅读文件。
