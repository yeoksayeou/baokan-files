Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: In view of the approaching final victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the high tide of the Japanese people's revolutionary movement, and the increasing strength of the national liberation movements in Southeast Asian countries, the US government is once again in a panic, dispatching its Secretary of Defense Johnson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, and Senior Advisor to the State Department Dulles to Japan to confer with MacArthur. They will conduct a "survey" of the overall military situation in the Far East and Japan, as well as the political and economic situation in Japan, in order to "re-" formulate the US conspiracy to invade Asia, and especially to turn Japan into a colonial military base. Johnson and Bradley left the US on the 11th and traveled to Pearl Harbor, Kwajalein, the Philippines, and other places along the way. They arrived in Tokyo on the 17th and began a series of meetings with MacArthur and US officials from the 18th. Dulles and the Director of the Northeast Asian Affairs Division of the US State Department, Allison, left the US on the 14th, transited through Tokyo to Seoul on the 17th, and are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the 20th.
