　　Regarding the Stealing of Disaster Relief Clothes Incident, Report on the Investigation Results by the Yutian County Government

Editor:
    We have seen the reader's critical letter published in the People's Voice on May 16th regarding the theft and exchange of disaster relief clothes by cadres in the Fourth District of Yutian County, and we immediately conducted a rigorous investigation. We are now informing you of the investigation process. Cadres in the Fourth and Seventh Districts of our county successively committed incidents of stealing and exchanging disaster relief clothes, and the situation was extremely serious.  Yu Deqian, Deputy District Chief of the Fourth District, Feng Boyi, work team leader, and seven others stole and exchanged a total of twenty-three items of clothing; in the Seventh District, led by District Chief Han Guangde and District Secretary Li Changfu, eleven comrades used civilian clothes to exchange for military uniforms, shirts, and other items, totaling forty-six pieces.  District Secretary Li Changfu alone stole and exchanged eleven items of clothing.

    During this investigation, we also discovered that Zheng Yunfang, the secretary of the Fourth District Government, and Yu Deqian, the Deputy District Chief, stole 1 million yuan of public funds, embezzled 290 catties of rice, and secretly smoked one tael and one mace of opium confiscated by the government.

    Regarding the embezzlement cases in our county, the county government reviewed its mistake of lacking education for cadres on weekdays, and strictly ordered the cadres in the two districts who had stolen and exchanged clothes to return all the stolen and exchanged clothes (the Fourth District has now returned part of them, with thirty-six items still unclear). In addition, we have ordered Han Guangde, the District Chief of the Seventh District, and Li Changfu, the District Secretary, to conduct self-criticism; Zheng Yunfang, the Secretary of the Fourth District, Yu Deqian, the Deputy District Chief, and Feng Boyi, the work team leader, are reflecting in the county government. Now, in addition to reporting the problem to the special commissioner's office, we are continuing to investigate the matter. After thoroughly clarifying the problem, we will give appropriate punishment to each of the cadres who violated the law.

　　关于窃取救灾衣服事件  玉田县府报告检查结果编辑同志：
    我们看到了五月十六日人民园地上刊登的读者对玉田县四区干部窃换救灾衣服的批评信，立即作了严格检查。今将检查经过告诉你们。我县四区和七区都曾相继发生干部窃换救灾衣服的事件，情形极为严重。四区副区长于德潜、工作队长冯柏益等九人共窃换衣服二十三件；七区在区长韩广德、区书李长富的带动下，有十一个同志用便衣换取军服、衬衫等共四十六件，而区书李长富一人竟窃换了衣服十一件。
    在这次检查中，我们又发现了四区区政府秘书郑云芳与副区长于德潜偷取公款一百万元、贪污大米二百九十斤和偷吸政府所没收的大烟一两一钱等事情。
    对于我县发生的贪污案件，县政府检讨了平日对干部缺乏教育的错误，并严饬该两区窃换衣服的干部、将窃换的衣服全部退回（四区现已退回一部，尚有三十六件未弄清）。此外，我们已令七区区长韩广德、区书李长富二人作自我检讨；四区秘书郑云芳、副区长于德潜、工作队长冯柏益等三人在县府反省。现在我们除已将问题发生经过呈报专署外，并继续追查此事。俟将问题彻底弄清之后，分别给各违法干部以适当处分。
   玉田县人民政府
