    To Protect the Interests of Silkworm Farmers and Expand Export of Native Products
  　Jiangsu and Zhejiang Are Widely Purchasing Spring Cocoons
    Material Exchange Becomes Smoother, Market Transaction Volume Increases
    [Our Newspaper] Spring cocoons have been successively hitting the market in vast areas such as Zhejiang, Southern Jiangsu, and Northern Jiangsu. In order to protect the interests of silkworm farmers and expand the export of native products, the China Silk Company is actively conducting purchases. As a result, material exchanges between Hangzhou and coastal cities have gradually become smoother, and market transactions have also become active. This year, Zhejiang, Southern Jiangsu, and Northern Jiangsu distributed more than 822,000 improved silkworm egg sheets. It is estimated that cocoon production can reach more than 270,000 dan (a unit of weight), of which Zhejiang's 21 counties and cities account for more than two-thirds of the egg sheet distribution. Therefore, it is estimated that the province's output this year can exceed the planned target by 34.08 percent, and Southern Jiangsu can exceed it by 8.46 percent. The China Silk Company's purchase work in Zhejiang has been started successively since April, and Southern and Northern Jiangsu have also started purchasing at the beginning of this month. To facilitate the purchase work, cocoon collection stations have been set up in various places, totaling 158 in Zhejiang, 168 in Southern Jiangsu, and 4 in Northern Jiangsu. A total of 12,070 people have been mobilized in the three regions to engage in cocoon collection work.
    In addition, specialized companies such as grain, cotton yarn, general merchandise, and local products have also mobilized most of their personnel to set up material supply stations in rural areas to cooperate with the cocoon collection work, so that silkworm farmers can obtain a large number of cheap daily necessities after selling fresh cocoons. At the same time, part of the released currency is withdrawn to stabilize the market. During this period, the People's Bank of China also organized cadres to go to the countryside to engage in rural financial work and promote the use of Renminbi in rural areas. For example, Southern Jiangsu sent 140 bank cadres to the countryside and established 13 offices. Each region plans to circulate a considerable amount of currency in rural areas, and the rest will be recovered through material supplies. For example, Zhejiang provides silkworm farmers with rice (70 percent), cotton yarn (5 percent), and general merchandise (5 percent), and circulates the remaining 20 percent in currency. It is estimated that Northern Jiangsu can produce more than 2,000 dan of fresh cocoons, and purchasing cadres have been sent to Huaiyin, Gaoyou, and other places. The total purchasing funds will reach more than 1 million jin of rice. At present, preliminary achievements have been made in the work of purchasing and withdrawing currency in various places. For example, Wuxing County in Zhejiang Province, due to tight administrative control, recovered 20 percent of cash on the first day after opening on May 20, and 50 percent on the second day. However, in some individual areas, the fluctuation of rice prices was caused due to poor material coordination, and more attention should be paid in the future.
    Due to the successive listing and purchase of spring cocoons in various places, the markets in various places have begun to break through the stagnant situation, and the sales of products suitable for farmers' needs have gradually expanded. For example, the turnover of the Hangzhou Native Products Company's store on May 26 was 40.09 million, which was more than three and a half times higher than that of the 15th, and it increased day by day. The sales volume of fertilizer from the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, kerosene from the department store, yarn from the cotton yarn company, and various colored fabrics suitable for farmers' needs produced by private factories have all increased significantly since the end of April. Another example is the private Meilun Silk and Cloth Shop, which has changed its business policy, and its daily turnover has increased from 4.5 million in April to about 6 million in May. At the same time, the general price level is stable, and the Renminbi has gradually established a solid reputation among the vast number of farmers.

### 照顾蚕农利益·开展土产外销　江浙广泛收购春茧  物资交流转畅市场成交量增加

    照顾蚕农利益·开展土产外销
  　江浙广泛收购春茧
    物资交流转畅市场成交量增加
    【本报讯】浙江、苏南、苏北等广大地区，春茧相继上市。中国蚕丝公司为照顾蚕农利益，开展土产外销，正积极进行收购。因而杭州与沿海各城市之间物资交流渐畅，市场交易亦呈现活跃。浙江、苏南、苏北三区今年曾发放改良蚕种量八十二万二千余张，产茧估计可达二十七万余市担，其中浙江二十一县市即占发种量的三分之二以上，故估计该省今年产量可超过预定计划百分之三四·○八，苏南可超过百分之八·四六。中蚕公司在浙江的收购工作自四月份以来，即相继开始，苏南、苏北亦于本月初相继开秤。为便利收购工作，各地并设收茧站，计浙江区一百五十八个，苏南区共有一百六十八个，苏北区四个，三区共动员一万二千零七十人从事收茧工作。
    此外，粮食、花纱布、百货、土产等各专业公司亦动员大部人力，下乡设立物资供应站，配合收茧工作，使蚕农出售鲜茧后，就可获得大批便宜的日用必需品，同时也使放出货币部分回笼，以稳定市场。人民银行亦于此期间组织了干部下乡，从事农村金融工作，推动人民币下乡。如苏南即有一百四十个银行干部下乡，建立了十三个办事处。各区准备以相当数量的货币在乡间流通，其余则以物资供应收回。如浙江以大米百分之七十，纱布百分之五，百货百分之五下乡，供应蚕农需要，另以百分之二十的货币流通。苏北估计可产鲜茧二千余市担，收购干部已派赴淮阴、高邮等地，全部收购资金将达一百余万斤大米。现各地收购与回笼工作，已做出初步成绩。如浙江吴兴县因行政上抓得紧，于五月二十日开秤后，第一天即回笼现钞百分之二十，第二天回笼百分之五十。但也有个别地区，因物资配合得不好，曾引起过米价的波动，今后应加倍注意。
    由于各地春茧相继上市和收购，各地市场已开始打破停滞局面，适合于农民需要的产品销路已渐扩大。如杭州土产公司门市部五月二十六日的营业额为四千零九十万，比十五日增加了三倍半以上，其中每天有增无减。市供销总社的肥田粉，百货公司的煤油，花纱布公司的纱布，及私营厂商所出的各色适合农民需要的色布，销售数量从四月下旬以来均有显著增加。又如私营美纶绸布庄因改变了经营方针，每天营业额已从四月份的四百五十万元增加到五月份的六百万元左右。同时一般物价均呈平稳，人民币在广大农民中逐渐建立了巩固的信用。
