　　The Songs and Dances of Southwestern Minorities Express Strong Love and Hatred
　　Mu Xin
　　When we marched into Yunnan, from the border between Yunnan and Guizhou to Kunming, what touched people the most was the sincere enthusiasm of the minority compatriots for our army. In every area and village inhabited by the Yi, Miao, Sa, and Yao ethnic groups we passed, there were teams in brightly colored costumes welcoming us. They paid tribute to the passing commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army with the most respectful ethnic etiquette, and entertained the people's troops with the best songs and dances.
　　All minority ethnic groups have a common characteristic: they love singing and dancing, and men, women, old, and young of all ethnic groups sing and dance very well. From their ancient costumes and enthusiastic songs and dances, one can see their simplicity, kindness, and enthusiasm. On the day of the Spring Festival, we passed through Guishan District (located between Mile, Lunan, and Luliang counties, where the Sani people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, established a liberated area and persisted until the liberation of the entire province). At the foot of the famous scenic spot—the Stone Forest—the Sani people of Wukeshu sang the glorious history of their ethnic group on the grassland, singing of the painful experiences of thousands of years. The song "Guandou Seedling" they sang and danced was extremely tragic and moving. "Guandou seedling, just sprouting, the cruel cats and dogs ate it. The brother across the street just grew up, the unlucky Baozhang dragged him away. Dragged him away, to do what? Fight on the rolling riverbank. The foolish brother became cannon fodder, the clever brother ran away, deserted and came back as a hero. The brothers in the liberated area welcomed him, hand in hand, to rejoin the ranks, and we are ready to welcome him. ...” In addition, there are many lyrical songs, which are also very beautiful and moving.
　　The Miao people living in the border area between Yunnan and Guizhou also sang many songs during the process of awakening and struggle. One song, "The Suffering of the Miao People," accused the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang: "The sun sets red! The moon rises yellow! The Miao people want to stand up and get rid of suffering and sorrow. It's like the moon chasing the sun! The more you chase, the more hopeless it becomes!"
　　"The sun sets in the west! The moon rises in the east! The Miao people want to live, busy bowing their heads every day! It's like the moon and the sun! Busy all year round! So busy that our backs ache and our bones break, but in the end, we don't have a single grain!"
　　"The Miao people want freedom, the Miao people want equality! We provide food and we serve as soldiers. Why are others enjoying themselves, but we have no share? Why are we not allowed to ask about national affairs?"
　　Later, in Yiliang and Kunming, we saw the songs and dances of ethnic minorities again and again. More than 40 Sani Yi compatriots from Guishan District also brought Xiao drums and some simple costumes, traveling a long way to Kunming to perform. People recalled: Five years ago, a person named Taiyang once brought a group of minority sisters from Guishan and Xishan, and hurriedly walked through the streets of Kunming. People watched this group of people in colorful clothes with curious eyes. When they performed their songs and dances in the theater, military police came to stop them and tricked them back to Guishan and Xishan. However, today the times have changed, and Taiyang's sisters are wearing brand-new clothes, striding forward on the streets of Kunming. They took the stage and were wildly welcomed by the citizens. They sang many songs and performed many plays. One song called "Old Guishan" sorrowfully sang of the past suffering of the Sani people, but it was also full of joy after the victory of the struggle: "Old Guishan, Old Guishan, the mountains are high and the forests are dense and dark. Old Guishan, Old Guishan, na li li yo, the Axi flute plays sadly, and the Sani girls are full of tears. We can't get enough to eat of the soybean rice, and the linen clothes are tattered and cold. The landlord is like an executioner, and the official is a living閻王 [Yan Wang, King of Hell]. The Communist Party, fighting for liberation, planted the red flag on Old Guishan. The people of Yunnan made revolution, and Guishan fired the first shot. The Axi young men became Red Army soldiers, and the Sani girls delivered military rations. Chiang Kai-shek's three levies were terrible, but the people became stronger and stronger, and their blood and sweat spread all over Old Guishan. Old Guishan, shines with red light."
　　These songs showed their awakening process. They used strong emotions to express their infinite hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries and their infinite love for the Communist Party.

### 西南少数民族的歌舞表现了强烈的爱与憎

　　西南少数民族的歌舞  表现了强烈的爱与憎
    穆欣
    当我们进军云南时，从滇黔边境到昆明的路上，最使人感动的，便是那些少数民族同胞对于我军的真挚热情。我们经过的每一处彝族、苗族、沙族、徭族集居的地区和村寨，都有穿着鲜艳服装的队伍在欢迎我们。他们用最尊敬的民族礼节，向经过的解放军指战员致敬，拿最好的歌曲和舞蹈来招待人民的部队。
    所有少数民族有一个共同的特点，就是喜欢歌唱和舞蹈，各族的男女老幼都舞唱得很好。从他们古老的装束和热情的歌舞中，可以看出他们的朴实，善良与热情。春节那天，我们经过圭山区（在弥勒、路南、陆良三县之间，住在这里的撒尼族人民，曾在共产党的领导下，创立了解放区，坚持到全省解放。）在著名的风景区——石林的山脚下，五棵树的撒尼族人民，在草地上唱了自己民族的光荣历史，唱出了数千年来的痛苦经历。他们舞唱的一曲“莞豆秧”，极其悲壮动人。“莞豆秧，才发芽，狠心的猫狗吃了它。对门的哥哥才长大，背时的保长拉了他。拉了他，去作啥？滚滚江边把仗打。愚蠢的哥哥当炮灰，聪明的哥哥逃掉啦，开小差来顶瓜瓜，解放区的哥哥欢迎他，手拉手来归队伍，咱们就准备欢迎他。……”此外，还有许多抒情的歌子，也非常幽美动人。
    居住在滇黔边境地区的苗族，在觉醒与斗争的过程中，也唱了许多歌子。有一首“苗家苦”，对国民党反动统治控诉道：“太阳落山红啊！月亮出来黄啊！苗家要出头，摆脱苦和愁。好比月亮赶太阳啊，越赶就越没下场！”
    “太阳西边落啊！月亮东边升啊！苗家要活命，天天低头忙！好比月亮和太阳啊，一年到头忙啊！忙得腰酸骨头断啊，到头来没有一颗粮！”
    “苗家要自由啊，苗家要平等啊！我们出了粮，我们当了兵。为什么别人在享福啊，我们就没有份哪？为什么国家事，不让我们问啊”？
    以后，在宜良与昆明，我们一次又一次地看到少数民族的歌舞。圭山区也有四十多个撒尼族的彝胞，带着萧鼓和一些简单的化装衣服，老远的赶到昆明来演唱。人们回忆起：五年以前，有一个名叫太阳的人，曾经从圭山、西山带来了一群少数民族的姊妹们，匆匆地走过了昆明的马路，人们都以新奇的眼光，注视这一群穿着花花绿绿衣服的人群。当他们在戏院里演出自己的歌舞时，宪兵警察便前来制止，把她们骗回圭山、西山去。但是，今天时代变了，太阳的姊妹们，穿上了簇新的衣服，挺胸迈步在昆明马路上。他们登台表演，受到市民狂烈的欢迎。他们唱了许多歌演了许多剧。有一首叫作“老圭山”的歌，很悲痛地唱出撒尼族过去的苦难，但也充满了斗争胜利后的欢欣：“老圭山，老圭山，山高林密黑茫茫。老圭山，老圭山，哪哩哩哟，阿细笛子吹得惨，撒尼姑娘泪汪汪。菽子饭，吃不饱，麻布衣裳破又凉。地主好比催命鬼，官家就是活阎王。共产党，争解放，红旗插在老圭山。云南人民闹革命，圭山打出第一枪。阿细小伙当红军，撒尼姑娘送军粮。蒋匪三征搞得惨，人民越打越坚强，血汗洒遍老圭山。老圭山，闪红光。”
    这些歌唱，表现出了他们觉醒的过程。他们用强烈的感情，诉述了他们对国民党反动派的无限仇恨和对共产党的无限热爱。
