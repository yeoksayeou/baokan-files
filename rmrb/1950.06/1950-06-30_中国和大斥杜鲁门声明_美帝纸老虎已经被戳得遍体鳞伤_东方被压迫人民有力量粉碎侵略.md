Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: The China Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued the following statement on June 29th regarding Truman's challenging statement of June 27th:

　　In his statement, Truman openly announced the participation of the U.S. Air Force and Navy in the war against the Korean people, brutally supporting the Lee Seung-man puppet clique, the culprit who first launched the war, openly announced naval control of Taiwan, and adventurously interfered in the just war of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan; at the same time, he also openly announced the strengthening of military assistance to the reactionary government of the Philippines and the French occupying forces and the Bao Dai puppet government in Vietnam, viciously opposing the national liberation movements of the people of the Philippines and Vietnam. Truman's statement and the subsequent dispatch of the U.S. Air Force and Navy have disrupted peace in the Far East. The U.S. government has revealed its hideous face as the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, the Korean people, the Vietnamese people, the Filipino people, and the people of other Asian countries. The U.S. government has violated the territorial integrity and sovereignty of various countries, completely tearing up previous international agreements and the United Nations Charter.

　　This further act of aggression by U.S. imperialism in interfering in Asian affairs can only arouse the unparalleled indignation and strong resistance of the Chinese people and the people of other countries. It will never frighten the awakened or awakening people of Asian countries, especially the victorious Chinese people. The Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries have sufficient strength to crush the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism and expose the paper tiger of U.S. imperialism, which appears strong but is weak inside. The Chinese people, in the heroic battles of the past four years, have defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries, who were fully armed by U.S. imperialism, and have already stabbed the paper tiger of U.S. imperialism all over; now, the Korean People's Army, after the open participation of the United States in the war, has rapidly liberated the Korean capital, Seoul, which has once again exposed the true face of the paper tiger of U.S. imperialism. China's sacred territory of Taiwan must be liberated, the Korean people must win, and the oppressed people of the East must stand up. This is a matter of course, and it can never be stopped by the evil forces of U.S. imperialism.

　　We, representing the peace-loving Chinese people, express our utmost anger and contempt for Truman's challenging statement that openly disrupts peace in the Far East. We warmly support the solemn statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our country and vow to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the liberation of all of China; and together with the people of the Far East and peace-loving people all over the world, we will fight to crush the challenging acts of U.S. imperialism and to defend peace in the Far East and world peace.

### 中国和大斥杜鲁门声明  美帝纸老虎已经被戳得遍体鳞伤  东方被压迫人民有力量粉碎侵略

　　中国和大斥杜鲁门声明
    美帝纸老虎已经被戳得遍体鳞伤  东方被压迫人民有力量粉碎侵略
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国保卫世界和平大会委员会二十九日就杜鲁门二十七日的挑战声明发表声明如下：
    杜鲁门在声明中公然宣布美国空海军参加对朝鲜人民的作战，横暴地支持首先发动战争的祸首李承晚傀儡集团，公然宣布以海军控制台湾，冒险地干涉中国人民解放台湾的正义战争；同时还公然宣布加强对菲律宾反动政府和越南法国占领军及保大傀儡政府的军事援助，凶恶地反对菲律宾和越南两国人民的民族解放运动。杜鲁门的声明和接踵而来的美国空海军的出动，破坏了远东的和平。美国政府已露出了它是中国人民、朝鲜人民、越南人民、菲律宾人民以及亚洲其他各国人民的死敌的狰狞面目。美国政府侵犯了各国领土主权的完整，完全撕毁了历次的国际协定和联合国宪章。
    美帝国主义这一进一步干涉亚洲事务的侵略行为，只能激起中国人民以及其他各国人民的无比义愤和有力的反抗。它决不能吓唬已经觉醒的或正在觉醒的亚洲各国人民，特别是决不能吓唬胜利了的中国人民。中国人民和亚洲其他国家人民有足够力量粉碎美帝国主义的侵略行为，戳穿美帝国主义这只外强中干的纸老虎。中国人民在四年来的英勇战斗中打垮了为美帝国主义全副武装起来的国民党反动派，早已把美帝国主义这只纸老虎戳得遍体鳞伤；现在，朝鲜人民军在美国公开参战后仍迅速解放了朝鲜首都汉城，这就又一次戳穿了美帝国主义这只纸老虎的真面目。中国神圣的领土台湾一定要解放，朝鲜人民一定要胜利，东方的被压迫人民一定要翻身，这是天经地义的事，这决不是美帝国主义的恶势力所能阻挡得住的。
    我们代表爱好和平的中国人民，对杜鲁门的公然破坏远东和平的挑战声明，表示无比的愤怒与鄙视。我们热烈拥护我国外交部周恩来部长的庄严声明，誓为解放台湾、解放全中国而斗争；并与远东人民及全世界爱好和平人民一起，为粉碎美帝国主义的挑战行为，为保卫远东和平与世界和平而斗争。
            中国保卫世界和平大会委员会
              六月二十九日
