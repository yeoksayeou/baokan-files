　　Railway Engineering Corps Achieves Brilliant Success
    Major Bridge Projects on the Jinghan, Yuehan, and Longhai Trunk Lines Nearing Completion
    Soldiers Selflessly Labor and Diligently Study Technology
    New China's Bridge Engineering Increasingly Standardized
    [This newspaper reports] Our correspondent Chen Ji reports: The various detachments of the Railway Engineering Corps, fighting valiantly on the Longhai, Yuehan, and Jinghan three major railway trunk lines, are about to victoriously complete the permanent repair of bridge projects. The completion of these tasks will ensure the safety of bridges during the rainy season, lay a solid foundation for future transportation work, and move New China's railway construction towards standardization. The First Detachment on the Longhai Line, while repairing the Luoyang Yellow River Railway Bridge, has completed the major part of the construction of the remaining four iron bridges in Lingbao and other places, and is now actively constructing three dangerous high-fill soil culvert projects. All bridge projects of this detachment will be completed before June 20. The Second Detachment working on the Yuehan Line has completed the repair of twenty-four bridges including Qujiang and Qianjiang ahead of schedule; and is cooperating with the Hengyang Railway Bureau to repair the lines to improve the line quality of the Yuehan Railway. The Third and Fourth Detachments on the Jinghan Line have also completed their bridge projects on schedule. The famous First, Second, Third, and Fourth Shahe Railway Bridges on the Jinghan Line, except for the First Shahe Bridge, which is currently erecting steel beams, have been completed by the heroic soldiers of the Fourth Detachment. The newly established Sixth Detachment and the First Engineering Office have also created many moving deeds in the construction of bridge projects. After completing the seven major bridge projects on the Jinghan Railway, the First Engineering Office said with confidence: "We are no longer afraid of flood invasions." The acceptance team composed of the Ministry of Railways, the Railway Engineering Corps, and the Tianjin Railway Bureau inspected the substructure of their seven major bridges and considered: the quality of their construction is either good or excellent.
    In the construction of bridge projects by various detachments, special attention was paid to saving materials and labor. They fundamentally reversed the previous wasteful phenomenon of "only caring about the task and not accounting." They can carefully protect and cherish a sleeper, a screw, and a pair of iron pliers. During their spare time, the soldiers of the First Detachment generally collected materials scattered in various places and launched a material collection competition. Sometimes, in order to retrieve an iron hammer lost in the water, they bravely jumped into the icy water, regardless of the severe cold, and only felt happy after retrieving the hammer. No less than a hundred people have been credited for saving materials. The soldiers of the Second Detachment are the same. They carefully protected the old wood and old iron materials when dismantling the temporary bridges. Some soldiers tied the screws one by one with ropes and put them around their necks when removing screws, for fear of losing them. In the past, the various detachments did not calculate enough in the organization of manpower, which wasted countless man-hours. Now they also pay attention to the rational allocation of labor and the establishment of a contract responsibility system. According to the nature of work such as pile driving, material transportation, and paving, several groups are appropriately formed to work separately. As a result, work efficiency has been significantly improved. For example, in the beam project of the First Detachment, the work efficiency increased three times due to the proper coordination of labor. For another example, when the Fourth Detachment first erected the Second Shahe Railway Bridge, it took two hours to erect the first span; later, it reorganized the labor force and made all preparations, and the span was erected in fifteen minutes. The Second Detachment also paid attention to reducing the number of staff in the organs, and transferred more than 500 people from the detachment and brigade to direct production, so that the number of attendance days of the team increased by more than 10,000 per month, so their attendance rate in the first quarter was higher than any other detachment, which played a great role in their work progress.
    Another feature of the work of the detachments this year is the improvement of the technical level of the soldiers. Before the permanent repair of bridges, the soldiers did not understand the formal bridge engineering technology. Some soldiers had never seen large steel beams, could not distinguish between screws and pins, could not use iron hammers, did not know how to rivet, and did not know how to make concrete. Due to their dedicated study and apprenticeship to workers as technical masters, today they are about to become technical soldiers. The Second Detachment sent 300 soldiers to the Hengyang Railway Bureau to learn from technicians; the First Detachment had workers to help guide them in the construction project; at the same time, the technical personnel of the various detachments were able to go deep into the site, which accelerated the technical learning of the soldiers. For example, the soldiers of the Sixth Detachment used to need to hit a railroad spike more than twenty times; now they only need to hit it five or six times, and it is firmly fixed. The soldiers of the First Detachment not only understood general technology, but also had some new technological innovations in their actual work. In their meritorious deeds, most of the soldiers have won great merits because of new inventions and creations. They said: "We want to learn technology and become a regular technical corps." Some soldiers discussed technology with each other during their rest time, and also established a regular "Zhuge Liang Conference" system for studying technology.
    The soldiers' labor enthusiasm in the work is high, they maintain and carry forward the fighting spirit when rushing to repair the lines, and they are constantly advancing valiantly. They are not afraid of the miasma in the south, and they don't care about the wind and sand in the northwest. They never stop working in the cold snowy weather; in the hot summer, they advance joyfully. The soldiers of the First Detachment forgot to eat during the competition; they still attacked the task during the rest time. Some soldiers were injured at work, but they did not leave their posts. The soldiers of the Railway Engineering Corps have thus won victory, and the railway bridge construction of New China has also won victory.

　　铁道兵团创造辉煌成绩
    京汉、粤汉、陇海三大干线主要正桥工程即将完成
    战士忘我劳动艰苦学习技术
    新中国桥梁工程益趋正规化
    【本报讯】记者陈迹报道：转战在陇海、粤汉、京汉三大铁路干线上的铁道兵团各支队，奋勇进行永久修复桥梁工程，即将胜利完成任务。这些任务的完成将保证雨季期间桥梁的安全，为今后运输工作打下巩固的基础，并使新中国的铁道建设趋向正规化。陇海线上的第一支队在修通洛河大铁桥的同时，已将其余灵宝等四座铁桥的大部工程修建完成，现正积极建筑三处险峻的高填土涵洞工程。该队全部桥梁工程，将在六月二十日以前竣工。在粤汉线上工作的第二支队，已提前完成曲江、潜江等二十四座桥梁修复工程；并配合衡阳铁路局补修线路，以提高粤汉路的线路质量。在京汉线上的第三、四支队，亦按期完成桥梁工程的任务。京汉线上有名的第一、二、三、四沙河铁桥，除正在架设钢梁的第一沙河桥外，已被第四支队英勇的战士修筑完竣。新近成立的第六支队和第一工程处，在修筑桥梁工程中，亦创造了不少动人的事迹。第一工程处把京汉路的七大桥梁工程修成以后，他们自信地说：“咱们再不害怕洪水的侵犯了。”铁道部、铁道兵团和天津路局组成的验收小组，曾对他们七大桥梁的下部工程加以验收，认为：他们修建的工程质量不是好，就是优。
    在各支队修建桥梁工程中，特别注意了省料和省工。他们根本扭转了以往“只顾任务，不算账”的浪费现象。对于一根枕木，一个螺丝，一把铁钳，都能认真保护，加以爱惜。一支队的战士们，在工余时间，普遍地搜集散失于各处的器材，并发动了搜集材料的竞赛运动。有时，为了捞起一把失落水中的铁锤，他们不畏严寒，奋勇地跳进冰水，把铁锤捞上来，才感到愉快。他们因节省器材而立功的不下百人。二支队的战士们也是一样。他们在拆卸便桥时，都还仔细地爱护旧木料和旧铁料。有些战士在起螺丝钉的时候，害怕螺丝失落，用绳子把螺丝一个个地拴起来，套在自己的颈项里。过去各支队在组织人力方面，计算不够，曾浪费了无数的人工。现在他们也注意了合理地分配劳动力，建立包工负责制。按照打桩、运料、铺道等工作性质，适当地组成几个小组，分头工作。因而工作效率显著提高。例如一支队在对梁工程中，因劳动力配合得当，工作效率提高了三倍。又如四支队在起初架第二沙河铁桥时，花了两小时还没架上第一孔梁；后来重新组织劳动力，做好一切准备工作，十五分钟就架好了一孔梁。二支队并注意紧缩机关的工作人员，从支队、大队抽出五百多人投入直接生产，使该队每月出勤工数增加一万多工，因此他们第一季度的出工率，比任何一个支队都要高，这对于他们的工作进展，起了莫大的作用。
    各支队在今年工作中的另一特点，就是提高了战士们的技术水平。在永久修复桥梁之前，战士们是不懂得正规的桥梁工程技术的。有些战士没看见过大的钢梁，分不清螺丝、梢子，不会使用铁锤，不懂得铆铆钉，不知道怎样打混凝土。由于他们的钻心学习，拜工友为技术师傅，今天他们已快成为技术兵了。二支队曾派了三百个战士到衡阳铁路局，向技术工人学习；一支队在建筑工程中，曾有工友们帮助指导；同时，各支队的技术人员都能深入现场，这样就使得战士们的技术学习加快一步。比如六支队战士过去打一根道钉，需要打二十多锤；现在只要打五、六锤，而且打得坚牢。一支队战士们不仅懂得了一般技术，而且在实际工作中还有一些新技术的创造。在他们立功的事迹中，多数的战士都因为有新发明和新创造，而获得大功。他们说：“我们要学习技术，成为正规技术兵团。”有些战士在休息的时间，互相讨论技术，还建立了经常研究技术的“诸葛亮会议”制度。
    战士们在工作中的劳动热情是高涨的，他们保持和发扬着抢修线路时的战斗精神，始终不懈地奋勇迈进。他们不怕南方的瘴气，不管西北的风沙。在寒冷的雪天，他们从不停止工作；在炎热的暑天，他们欢跃地前进。一支队的战士在竞赛运动中，忘记了吃饭；在休息的时刻，还突击任务。有些战士在工作中受了伤，还是不下工作岗位。铁道兵团的战士们由此获得了胜利，新中国的铁道桥梁修建也由此获得了胜利。
