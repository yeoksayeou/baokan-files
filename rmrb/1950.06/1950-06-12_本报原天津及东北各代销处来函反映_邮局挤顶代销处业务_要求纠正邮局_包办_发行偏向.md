　　Original Tianjin and Northeast Sales Agents of This Newspaper Report
    Post Office Squeezes Out Sales Agents' Business
    Request Correction of the Post Office's "Monopolizing" Issuance Bias
    [This Newspaper] Recently, the original Tianjin sales agent of this newspaper sent a letter to Hu Qiaomu, Director of the News Publication Administration. The sales agents in Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, Andong, Anshan, Harbin, and Dalian sent letters to the business department of this newspaper, reporting on the situation of local post offices squeezing out the sales agents' newspaper distribution business. They requested a response and correction of the biases occurring in the post office's newspaper distribution work. The letters mentioned the following situations: 1. The post office's newspaper distribution is not aimed at promoting subscriptions to readers who have not yet subscribed, but rather at developing the original subscribers of the sales agents, thus seizing the original subscribers of the sales agents. For example, the Jilin sales agent had 48 of its original subscribers taken away by the post office. 2. The post office has raised wholesale prices, making it unprofitable for sales agents. The Tianjin Post Office wholesales newspapers at an 80% discount, with the wholesale price being the same as the subscription price for readers; in the Northeast, the wholesale price has been changed from a 75% discount to an 85% discount. These factors prevent the sales agents from obtaining reasonable profits, making it difficult for employees to maintain their livelihoods. 3. In Tianjin and the Northeast, some post offices, in order to win subscribers, make propaganda to readers that is detrimental to the business of the sales agents, such as saying that the sales agents are private profit-seeking entities, are exploitative, and lack integrity. As a result, the business of each sales agent has suffered losses, and the distribution of the Party newspaper has also been affected. 4. According to reports from sales agents in the Northeast, post offices in various parts of the Northeast openly demanded lists of subscribers from the sales agents, ordering them to hand over the business of distributing this newspaper. On May 21, the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration even published a notice in the Northeast Daily announcing the complete cancellation of all sales agents in the Northeast from June 1 due to the sales agents giving preferential treatment to readers. Based on the above situation of the post office squeezing out the business of the sales agents, the Tianjin sales agents and the Northeast sales agents urgently request that the biases occurring in the post office's newspaper distribution work be corrected.

　　本报原天津及东北各代销处来函反映
    邮局挤顶代销处业务
    要求纠正邮局“包办”发行偏向
    【本报讯】最近本报原天津代销处致函新闻总署胡乔木署长，沈阳、长春、吉林、安东、鞍山、哈尔滨、大连代销处致函本报经理部，报告各地邮局挤顶代销处发行报纸的情况，要求给以答复，并纠正邮局方面发行报纸工作中所发生的偏向。来函中提到下面这些情况：一、邮局发行报纸，不是向着尚未订报的读者推广，而是向着代销处的原有订户发展，这样就夺取了代销处的原有订户。如吉林代销处原有的订户便被邮局夺去四十八户。二、邮局提高了批发价格，使代销户无利可图。天津邮局以八折批发报纸，批发价与读者订阅价格相同；东北则将批发价由七五折改为八五折。这些都使代销处不能得到合理的利润，职工生活难以维持。三、在天津和东北有些邮局为了争取订户，向读者作对代销处营业不利的宣传，如说代销处为私人营利，是含有剥削性，没有信义等等，这样各代销处的业务都受到了损失，同时对于党报的发行也受到了影响。四、据东北各代销处报告称：在东北各地邮局公然向代销处索取订户名单，令将代销本报的业务交出，五月二十一日东北邮电总局更因代销处给以读者优待，而在东北日报登出自六月一日全部撤销东北各地代销处的启事。根据以上邮局对代销处业务挤顶的情况，天津各代销处及东北各代销处均迫切要求纠正邮局方面在发行报纸工作中发生的偏向。
