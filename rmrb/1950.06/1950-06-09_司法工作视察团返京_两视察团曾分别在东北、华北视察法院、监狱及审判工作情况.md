Judicial Work Inspection Teams Return to Beijing
Two Inspection Teams Visited Courts, Prisons, and Trial Work in Northeast and North China

To prepare for the first National Judicial Conference to be held in the near future, the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government, together with the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Legislative Affairs Commission, organized two judicial work inspection teams to go to the Northeast and North China to understand the actual situation of local judicial work. Both teams have now completed their inspections and returned to Beijing.

The Northeast Inspection Team was headed by Minister of Justice Shi Liang and Deputy President of the Supreme People's Court Wu Gaizhi as the chief and deputy leaders, respectively. The team consisted of twenty-two people, divided into three groups: judicial administration, trial, and prison. The team departed on May 7th and returned to Beijing on the 2nd of this month. They visited the courts and prisons in Shenyang, Fushun, Jilin, Harbin, Dalian, and Lushun. The groups also went to Xinmin, Benxi, Gongchangling, Shulan, and Jiutai to inspect prison administration and trial work.

The North China Inspection Team was led by President of the Supreme People's Court Shen Junru, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Li Liuru, and Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission Chen Shaoyu, with a total of thirty-six people. They departed on May 25th and returned to Beijing on the 3rd of this month. During the ten days, the team visited the courts, prisons, and public security bureau detention centers in Tianjin, Tangda District, Cangxian Prefecture, and Tangshan. The Supreme People's Procuratorate also invited relevant parties to exchange views on the establishment of local procuratorial organs.

During the inspection period, both inspection teams paid close attention to the public response and implementation experience after the promulgation of the Marriage Law. Through reports or symposiums, the teams corrected deviations in implementation in various places and answered many related questions.

According to the负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge) of the Northeast Inspection Team, the judicial work in Northeast China is adapting to the development of political and economic construction in the Northeast. People's courts have been established in 192 of the six provinces, one administrative office (Luda), four directly-administered cities, and 164 cities, counties, and banners. The majority of cadres in courts at all levels have been cultivated through work. Various working systems (such as review, reporting, and trial levels) have been established and are gradually being improved. Thanks to the leadership of the Northeast People's Government, the efforts of judicial cadres themselves, and the assistance of relevant departments, the judicial work in the Northeast has achieved many creative accomplishments.

The visits of the inspection teams to the Northeast and North China greatly encouraged judicial cadres at all levels in the area and strengthened their confidence in their work. At the same time, the heads of the central judicial leading organs also drew rich experience from the work at the lower levels. The two inspection teams are now sorting out materials from various places, summarizing experiences, and will submit written reports at the National Judicial Conference.

　　司法工作视察团返京
    两视察团曾分别在东北、华北视察法院、监狱及审判工作情况
    【新华社七日讯】中央人民政府司法部与最高人民法院、最高人民检察署、法制委员会等四机关，为开好将在近期举行的首次全国司法会议，曾组织两个司法工作视察团，分赴东北和华北了解地方司法工作实况。现两团均已视察完毕返回北京。
    东北视察团由司法部部长史良、最高人民法院副院长吴溉之分任正、副团长。全团共二十二人，分成司法行政、审判、监狱三组。该团于五月七日出发，本月二日返北京，曾先后视察了沈阳、抚顺、吉林、哈尔滨、大连、旅顺等地的法院和监狱工作，并分组前往新民、本溪、弓长岭、舒兰、九台等地视察狱政和审判工作。
    华北视察团由最高人民法院院长沈钧儒、最高人民检察署副检察长李六如和法制委员会主任委员陈绍禹等率领，一行共三十六人，于五月二十五日出发，本月三日返北京。十天中该团曾视察了天津、塘大区、沧县专区、唐山市一带的法院、监狱、公安局看守所等的工作情况；最高人民检察署并曾邀集有关方面，对建立地方检察机构问题交换意见。
    两视察团在各地视察期中，对婚姻法颁布后的群众反映和执行中的经验，也非常注意。两团曾通过报告或座谈会，纠正了各地在执行中的偏差，解答了许多有关问题。
    据东北视察团负责人谈：东北司法工作适应着东北政治、经济建设的发展，在六省、一行署（旅大）、四直属市、一百六十四个市、县、旗中，已设立人民法院一百九十二个。各级法院的干部，绝大部分都是从工作中培养出来的。各种工作制度（如复核、报告、审级等制度）多已建立，并渐臻健全中。由于东北人民政府的领导、司法干部本身的努力和有关部门的协助，东北司法工作已获得许多创造性的成就。
    此次视察团赴东北和华北，给当地各级司法干部很大的鼓舞，加强了他们的工作信心。同时，中央司法领导机关各负责人也从下级工作中吸取了丰富的经验。现在两视察团正在整理各地材料，总结经验，将于全国司法会议上提出书面报告。
