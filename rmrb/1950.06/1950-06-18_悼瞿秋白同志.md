　　In Memory of Comrade Qu Qiubai
    Wang Huizhi
    The Yan and Yi Mountains stand guard at the northern frontier, through the Tang, Song, Liao, and Jin dynasties, steadfast in defense. The royal aura of Youdu once stretched far and wide, a gathering place for talent and heroes. Comrade Qiubai, from his youth, cherished great ambitions and strove to be first in learning. Generously he often wielded Zu Ti's whip, his masculine spirit soaring to the heavens. Following the revolution on the Long March, he vowed to help the people eradicate injustice, regarding wealth and position as light as a feather, determined to cleanse the filth of feudalism. His personality shunned being a parasitic plant, instead striving to be a lamp in the long night for the masses. Braving wind and rain, wearing the moon and stars, he fought and rushed on an endless journey. Never imagining that strong grass would meet the frost, misfortune struck, and the jade tree was wounded. You were able to serve the country with loyalty, and though your body died, your name remains fragrant for eternity. Worthy of emulation, deserving of praise, your heroic spirit will forever shine in the world. Alas, from ancient times to the present, who can escape death, but only you, sir, will be admired for generations to come!

　　悼瞿秋白同志
    王惠之
    燕山易水号雄边，唐宋辽金守卫坚，幽都王气曾绵延，人文会萃多英贤。秋白先生自少年，早怀大志学争先，慷慨常持祖逖鞭，男儿壮气迫云天。追随革命作长征，愿助人民铲不平，已视富贵鸿毛轻，誓除封建洗污腥。个性羞为桑寄生，拚作人群长夜灯。栉风雨，戴月星，转战奔突无限程。不图劲草遇寒霜，厄运袭来玉树伤。君能报国叹忠良，身死名留万古香。堪标榜，足称扬，壮烈常存世界光。呜呼，古去今来谁不死，独佩先生百代有芬芳！
