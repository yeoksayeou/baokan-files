    The Story of a Pencil
    Yu Zhen
    (Comic strip) (6)
    (Nineteen) Muttering in his sleep, using his finger as a pen to write on himself, stroke by stroke until his eyes closed.
    (Twenty) Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it. After three months of this, I learned to write letters home, compose clappers, and keeping a diary didn't feel difficult anymore.
    (Twenty-one) The division's battle report published my clapper talk. I also wrote a "singing narrative" with my comrades. We revised it again and again, adding and adding; finally, I read it to my comrades, and they all said it was good. So I sent the "singing narrative" to "Soldiers' Life" (published by the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army).

    一支铅笔的故事
    余真
    （连环画）（六）
    （十九）睡觉时嘴里嘟哝着，手指当笔在身上写，一笔一划写到合上眼。
    （二十）天下没有难事，就怕心不专。这样三个月后，我学会写家信，编快板，记日记也不觉得困难。
    （二十一）师的战斗报登了我的快板。我又和同志们写了一篇“说唱”。改了又改，添了又添；最后我念给同志们听，同志们都说好。我便把“说唱”寄给“战士生活”（四野政治部出版的刊物）。
