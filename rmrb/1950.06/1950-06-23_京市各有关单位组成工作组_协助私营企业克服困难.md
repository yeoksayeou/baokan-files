　　Beijing Municipal Units Form Working Groups to Assist Private Enterprises in Overcoming Difficulties

　　[Beijing News Agency] To assist private industrial and commercial enterprises in overcoming temporary difficulties, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has specially formed working groups composed of cadres drawn from relevant organs and groups such as the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee, the Bureau of Industry, the Bureau of Commerce, the Taxation Bureau, the Labor Bureau, the Municipal Government Research Office, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The working groups have achieved some successes since they began work on May 18th.

　　Regarding the adjustment of public-private relations: The working groups first contacted various state-owned enterprises to place processing orders with private factories and purchase finished products, resolving some of the raw material, sales, and capital problems of private industry. For example, processing and ordering contracts have been signed with the iron industry as follows: The Ministry of Agriculture ordered 1,200 corn threshers; the North China Electric Power Bureau ordered 9,000 magnetic bottle screws and 6,000 high-voltage line hemp iron magnetic bottle seats. Agencies such as the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Machine Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory are preparing to place orders. In order to uniformly manage the processing and ordering work, the working groups assisted and led the Iron Industry Guild to organize the Iron Industry Processing and Ordering Management Committee. The machine paper-making industry, which had completely shut down, was contacted by the working groups with the Beijing branch of the Department Store to purchase one hundred reams of stored paper, enabling it to obtain funds, and three companies in the industry have now resumed work. The capital-weak cigarette industry is also being helped by the Department Store branch to purchase 200 to 300 boxes of finished products each month to solve the difficulty of capital turnover. Due to overproduction in the match industry, the working groups only provide key support. Regarding taxation, the working groups investigated the burden situation and, for industrial and commercial households with excessive tax burdens and poor business conditions, the Taxation Bureau separately reduced, exempted, or postponed tax payments. The tax collection procedures have also been adjusted, such as changing the cigarette industry's tax payment from the day after leaving the factory to once every ten days; tax assessment has been changed to be based on the ex-factory price. In addition, the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China also provides loan support to qualified factories.

　　Regarding the adjustment of labor-capital relations: Through the working groups, capitalists have been helped to improve their understanding of the government's economic policies, dispelling some of their ideological concerns. For example, Wu Jincui, manager of Jinli Iron Factory, who participated in the work of the working group, said: "Working with the working group, I realized that the People's Government is truly for the benefit of both labor and capital, and for the development of production." In the process of adjusting labor-capital disputes, the working groups adopted the method of labor-capital consultation for factories and shops with difficulties, in order to improve the enthusiasm of the capital side for management and improve management methods; at the same time, workers were educated to proceed from long-term interests and assist the capital side in overcoming difficulties. For example, after the labor-capital relations in Cihua Weaving and Dyeing Factory improved, the capital side increased investment by four pieces and ten bundles of yarn, and the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China provided a loan equivalent to ten pieces of yarn. Eight of the factory's eighteen employees directly participated in production. The factory is currently considering adjusting the unreasonable wage system. For another example, after labor-capital consultation in Hongxingde Rice Shop, the capital side increased investment by 20,000 catties of wheat to continue operations. The labor-capital consultation meetings have been established in Beiping, Chuqi, Yihe, Beiyang and other factories in the paper industry, and temporary labor-capital agreements have been signed. Workers voluntarily reduced their wages by 40% or 50% temporarily during the shutdown period, and decided to take turns returning to their hometowns to produce; the capital side also guaranteed to do its best to start work. After the working group mobilized the employees of the Zhonghua Department Store Sales Office and signed a temporary labor-capital agreement, the employees strengthened labor discipline and wages were reduced by 30% to 50%.

　　There are still some shortcomings in the work of the working groups, such as insufficient preparation work in advance, lack of in-depth analysis of the situation, and the selected typical households are not typical enough, which should be corrected urgently.

### 京市各有关单位组成工作组  协助私营企业克服困难

　　京市各有关单位组成工作组
    协助私营企业克服困难
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府为协助私营工商业度过暂时困难，特由市财经委员会、工业局、商业局、税务局、劳动局、市府研究室及中共北京市委会、市总工会、工商联合会筹备委员会等有关机关团体，抽派干部，组成工作组，协助私营工商业解决具体困难问题。工作组自五月十八日开始工作以来，已获得了一些成绩。
    在调整公私关系方面：工作组首先联络各国营企业向私营工厂进行加工订货，收购成品，解决私营工业的一部分原料、销路和资金等问题。如与铁工业签订加工订货合同的已有：农业部订了玉米脱粒机一千二百台；华北电业总局订了磁瓶螺丝九千个及高压线麻铁磁瓶座六千个。准备订货的有铁道部、农业部、水利部、重工业部机器工业局等机关和华北农业机械总厂等。为了统一掌握加工订货工作，工作组协助并领导铁工业同业公会，组织了铁工业加工订货管理委员会。已经全业停工的机器造纸业，经工作组向百货公司北京分公司联络，收购存纸一百令，使能获得资金，现该业已有三家复工。资金薄弱的卷烟业，也同样由百货分公司每月收购成品二百箱至三百箱，解决资金周转的困难。火柴业因生产过剩，工作组对其只作重点扶植。在税收上，工作组调查了负担情况，对税分过重、营业情况不好的工商业户，由税务局分别予以减税、免税，或缓缴。在征税手续上，也加以调整，如卷烟业过去是出厂后第二天纳税，现在改为每旬纳税一次；核税改为以出厂价为标准。此外，人民银行北京分行，并对合于条件的各厂予以贷款扶植。
    在调整劳资关系方面：通过工作组，帮助资本家提高对政府经济政策的认识，解除了他们思想上的一些顾虑。如参加工作组工作的金利铁工厂经理吴金萃说：“跟工作组在一起工作，我才知道人民政府真是为了劳资两利，发展生产。”在调整劳资纠纷过程中，工作组对有困难的工厂、商店，采取劳资协商的方式，提高资方经营的积极性，改善经营方法；同时并教育工人从长远利益出发，协助资方度过困难。例如慈华织染厂，劳资关系改善后，资方增资四件零十捆纱，并由人民银行北京分行贷款折十件纱。该厂十八个职员中，有八人直接参加了生产。厂内现正酝酿调整不合理的工资制度。又如鸿兴德米粮店劳资协商后，资方增资两万斤麦子，继续经营。造纸业中的北平、初起、义和、北洋等工厂，都成立了劳资协商会议，签订劳资临时协议，工人自愿在停工期间暂时降低工资百分之四十或五十，并决定轮流回乡生产；资方也保证尽力开工。中华百货售品所，经工作组动员签订劳资临时协议后，店员加强了劳动纪律，工资降低了百分之三十到五十。
    在工作组的工作中，现在还存在一些缺点，如事前准备工作作得不够，对情况缺乏深入分析，所选的典型户不够典型等，亟应纠正。
