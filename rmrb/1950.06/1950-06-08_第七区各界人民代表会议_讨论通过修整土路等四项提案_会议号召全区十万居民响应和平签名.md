　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The People's Representatives Conference of the Seventh District of Beijing discussed and approved proposals regarding sanitation and construction yesterday (the 7th).

　　This conference received 1,492 opinions and proposals from representatives of all sectors and residents. After excluding 192 opinions related to the work style of cadres, the remaining 1,300 opinions were consolidated and organized by the conference preparatory committee into more than 980 items. At yesterday's meeting, Han Linguang, the head of the Seventh District, reported on the results of the examination of these opinions on behalf of the presidium. After careful and enthusiastic discussion by all the representatives, they were unanimously approved by a show of hands. The meeting also discussed and approved three proposals put forward by the preparatory committee regarding repairing dirt roads in the district, repairing houses, and establishing sanitation regulations, as well as a proposal put forward by the Seventh District Public Office regarding launching a summer sanitation campaign. According to these four proposals, the meeting decided: (1) to suggest that the government call on street residents to contribute labor and money on a voluntary basis to repair certain streets in the district, and that the government provide assistance in terms of technology, organization, and leadership; (2) to suggest that the District Public Office and the Consultation Committee of the People's Representatives Conference of the District, invite certain individuals within the district to form a house repair committee, responsible for supervising and promoting the relevant work of repairing houses; (3) to establish three sanitation regulations to be jointly observed and implemented by all residents of the district; (4) to have the District Public Office and the Public Security Sub-bureau invite people from all walks of life in the district to jointly form a sanitation committee, and to establish branches in each police station to carry out the summer sanitation campaign.

　　In the group discussions and plenary speeches on the 7th, representatives from all walks of life enthusiastically supported the motions and opinions passed by the conference and decided to do their utmost to assist the government in mobilizing all residents to resolutely observe and implement them. Elementary school teacher Chen Jingyi said: Now the country's financial resources are limited, and the government still has many things to do. Therefore, we must adopt the attitude of being masters of our own affairs and consciously and voluntarily repair dirt roads. Doctor Zhang Xuchu said: The roads around Hongqiao used to be very bad, but later everyone worked together with one heart and repaired them in one day. Trolleybus company worker Hu Quangui said: We must bring the spirit of the conference back and take the lead in implementing the decisions of the conference.

　　Finally, the meeting unanimously passed a resolution calling on 100,000 residents of the district to respond to the World Peace Signature Campaign.

　　On the 8th, the conference will begin to criticize and examine the work style of the staff of various government departments.
