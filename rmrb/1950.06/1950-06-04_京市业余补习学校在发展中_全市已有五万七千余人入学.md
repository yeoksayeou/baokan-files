Beijing's Amateur Supplementary Schools are Developing
    Over 57,000 Students Enrolled Citywide
    Regular amateur schools have a total of 25,000 students; industry worker amateur schools have 10,000 students; adult supplementary schools have 22,000 students.
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: Based on the resolution of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, the Beijing Municipal Amateur Education Working Committee began establishing regular amateur schools for industrial workers and government cadres in various districts and major factories. Furthermore, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions respectively reorganized the original adult supplementary schools and worker supplementary schools in each district. Since then, 32 formally opened amateur schools have been established throughout the city, with 25,067 students (including 19,607 industrial workers) and 475 teachers. Industry worker amateur schools (including supplementary schools, training courses, and study groups) have approximately 10,000 students and 208 teachers (including 10 full-time teachers). Adult supplementary schools have a total of 682 classes with 22,072 students (women accounting for over 65%), and 966 teachers. In addition, seven amateur schools in units such as the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory are also in preparation and will soon open.
    Various necessary learning systems are gradually being established.
    In the process of establishing and reorganizing the above-mentioned various amateur schools, the first issue to be resolved was the education target. During this time, the labor union offices in various districts mobilized more than 3,000 industrial workers to transfer to amateur schools. Adult supplementary schools also introduced students with higher levels of literacy to political study classes held by cultural centers, while students under the age of fifteen were sent to children's supplementary schools. The second issue to be resolved was class organization: some students had strong reading abilities but weak written expression skills. The results of the class placement exams were very poor. After being assigned to classes, they felt the courses were too easy after a short period of study and requested to be promoted. Moreover, most of them had lower arithmetic skills than Chinese language skills. Therefore, after the exams, some schools examined the students' level from the classes and then adjusted them to determine their grade level. Some used a cross-class system (Chinese language and arithmetic classes were not taught in the same class) to solve the problem of inconsistent Chinese language and arithmetic levels. After that, the academic affairs departments of various schools formulated formal regulations such as meetings, reports, leave, roll call, exams, and supplementary lessons. At the same time, they helped students organize mutual aid groups, which played a role in mutual supervision and tutoring.
    This method of unified leadership and division of responsibility for running amateur education is still in its initial implementation stage in Beijing. The following problems have now been discovered: 1. Leadership issues: The three systems in amateur education are led by three different departments, and the specific work arrangements and promotion must be done through the cultural and educational sections of the district offices and the labor union offices. Due to the multiple contacts of the leading units and the small number of cadres below, the cultural and educational sections and the district offices felt that they could not complete these three tasks well. 2. Absenteeism: The most serious absenteeism in several district-based amateur schools reaches one-third or one-quarter of the students. Meetings, being on duty, irregular shifts, and rush overtime work are the main reasons for student absenteeism. 3. Regarding teaching materials: Those who use the textbooks compiled by the Amateur Education Working Committee mostly feel that the depth of the Chinese language texts is inappropriate and lacks scientific planning. There are few opportunities to review new words, and there are few annotations and explanations, which is not convenient for previewing and reviewing. There are too few exercises in arithmetic textbooks, and the content is not substantial. 4. Regarding teachers: The cultural and political level of some teachers is relatively low. They cannot grasp the key points when lecturing, or they make mistakes in their explanations, which affects the students' learning enthusiasm.
    Six improvement measures have been set to address existing shortcomings.
    In response to these shortcomings, the Amateur Education Working Committee has decided: 1. The three leading organizations (the Amateur Education Working Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education) will each send one person to work jointly once a week. In addition, each district will separately organize a district amateur education working committee to unify planning and lead the three types of amateur education work in the entire district. 2. Strengthen the cultural and educational sections of each district. 3. Reduce the number of absences in each school as much as possible. The method is that the Party, government, labor union and youth league guarantee that meetings will not be held during class time, appropriately adjust work under the conditions of not hindering production and business, improve students' mutual aid organizations, and make sure to catch up on missed lessons after absences. 4. Try to use supplementary teaching materials as much as possible to compensate for the lack of teaching materials. 5. Organize teachers to conduct political and professional studies. Political studies are led by the Beijing "Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Learning Committee," and professional studies are led by the Amateur Education Working Committee. Invite experts to give reports. And publish "Amateur Education Newsletter" as a reference material for teachers' professional learning. 6. Conduct inspection work in a planned and focused manner, deepen understanding of the situation, and specifically guide the work of each school.

### 京市业余补习学校在发展中  全市已有五万七千余人入学

　　京市业余补习学校在发展中
    全市已有五万七千余人入学
    正规业余学校共有学员二万五千人；行业工人业余学校共一万人；成人补习学校共二万二千人。
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：京市业余教育工作委员会根据市第二届各界人民代表会议的决议，在各区与各大工厂着手建立以产业工人和机关干部为对象的正规业余学校，以及市文教局和市总工会分别整顿各区原有的成人补习学校和工人补习学校以来，全市正式开课的业余学校已有三十二校，学员二万五千零六十七（内产业工人一万九千六百零七）人。教员四百七十五人。行业工人的业余学校（包括补习学校、训练班和学习小组）共有学员约万人，教员二百零八（内专任十）人。成人补习学校共六百八十二班，学员二万二千零七十二人（其中妇女占百分之六十五强），教员九百六十六人。此外尚有正在筹备中的华北农业机械总厂等单位的七个业余学校不久也将开学。
    各种必要的学习制度，正在逐渐建立起来。
    在建立与整顿上述各种业余学校的过程中，首先解决的是教育对象问题。其间各区工会办事处曾先后动员三千多产业工人转到业余学校。成人补习学校也介绍文化较高的学员参加文化馆举办的政治学习班，十五岁以下的学员则送入儿童补习学校。其次解决的是编班问题：有些学员阅读能力较强，文字表达能力差，编班考试的成绩很坏，分班后经短期学习就感到课程浅，要求升班。且多半是算术程度低于国文。因此，有些学校在考试之后，从上课中来考察学生的程度高低，然后加以调整，确定年级。有些便用交叉编班的办法（国语和算术不在同一班级上课）解决了国语、算术程度不一致的问题。之后，各种学校的教务部门即订出了会议、汇报、请假、点名、考试、补课等正规制度。同时帮助学员们组织了互助小组，起了互相督促和补课的作用。
    这种统一领导与分工负责办业余教育的办法，在北京还是初步实施，现在已发现了如下几个问题：一、领导问题：业余教育中的三个系统，由三个部门分别领导，而具体工作的布置与推动，都须通过区公所的文教科和工会办事处。由于领导单位多头联系，下面干部又少，因而使文教科和区办事处感到对这三重任务不能很好的完成。二、缺课问题：现在有几个以区为单位的业余学校缺课现象最严重的达人数的三分之一或四分之一，开会、值班、没有规律的倒班、突击加班，是学员缺课的主要原因。三、关于教材：采用业余教育工作委员会所编的课本的，大多感到国语课文的深浅不适当，缺乏科学的计划性。生字复习机会少，注解说明少，不便于预习和复习。算术课本习题太少，内容不充实。四、关于师资：一部分教员文化政治水平比较低，讲课时抓不住重点，或讲解错误，影响学员的学习情绪。
    针对现有缺点，定出六项改进办法。
    针对这些缺点，业余教育工作委员会已决定：一、三个领导机构（业余教育工作委员会、市总工会、市文教局）各派一人每星期联合办公一次。另由各区分别组织区业余教育工作委员会，统一计划，领导全区的三种业余教育工作。二、加强各区文教科。三、尽可能减低各校缺席人数，办法是党政工团保证在上课时间不开会，在不妨碍生产和业务的条件下适当地调整工作，健全学员的互助组织，缺课后一定抓紧时间补课。四、尽量采用补充教材，以补教材的不足。五、组织教员进行政治业务学习，政治学习由京市“中小学教职员学委会”领导，业务学习由业余教育工作委员会领导。请专人作报告。并出版“业余教育通讯”，作为教员业务学习的参考资料。六、有计划有重点地进行视导工作，深入了解情况，具体指导各校工作。
