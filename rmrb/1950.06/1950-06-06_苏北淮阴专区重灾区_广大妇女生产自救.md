　　[Subei News] Huaiyin Prefecture in Subei, one of the major disaster areas, has seen broad masses of women participating in a production self-salvation movement under the leadership and assistance of the district's Democratic Women's Federation in the struggle to overcome the famine through production. After being hit by the disaster last year, the people in the disaster area of Huaiyin Prefecture faced considerable hardship. The Huaiyin District Democratic Women's Federation, based on the district leadership's call to "grow household vegetables, dig for wild vegetables," and the principle of "three parts grain, seven parts vegetables," extensively mobilized women to grow vegetables last autumn. In winter, they mobilized the planting of winter vegetables, and called on women to dig vegetable plots, accumulate fertilizer, and prepare to plant spring vegetables this year. They also promptly coordinated with the local government to solve the difficulties faced by the disaster area, such as a lack of vegetable seeds, labor, and vegetable plots. Women in Huaiyin, Lianshui, Siyang and other places were mobilized to collect vegetable seeds and send them to the severely affected areas; helping families without labor to engage in mutual aid vegetable planting, and mobilizing families without vegetable plots to plant vegetables in wheat fields. At the end of last year, according to statistics from nine counties in the prefecture, 77,435 women participated in digging vegetable plots, cultivating 143,611 mu of land. In Shuangyao Township, Shuyang County alone, 588 mu of spring vegetables were planted this year. The entire township has 4,382 people, with an average of 0.013 mu of vegetable land per person, which can solve one month's living problems. The Women's Federation also, according to the principle of "relying on the mountains if you live near mountains, and relying on the water if you live near water," mobilized women in various places to participate in various sideline productions according to local conditions. Huai'bao County mobilized women to catch fish and shrimp. In Ruyi Township, Shanyang District, Li Jinxiang led 50 women from two villages to catch fish, obtaining 40 dan of fish, which was exchanged for 10 dan of rice. The rice was then sold and 40 dan of rice bran were bought, with 8 dou distributed to each of the 50 disaster victims. In addition, women were mobilized to engage in sideline industries such as grinding flour, spinning, weaving, and pressing oil. According to incomplete statistics from six counties, a total of 4,934 households and 9,631 women participated in weaving mats, folding screens, and cattail bags. In one village in Guanyun, each person can weave an average of four mats a day, earning four jin of grain, and can also collect straw for fuel. A family with one person weaving mats can support four people. In Shuangyao Township, Shuyang, a total of 4,360 men and women in the township participated in sideline production, including 2,965 women, accounting for 68 percent of the total, overcoming the difficulty of labor shortage. In order to respond to the government's disaster relief work instructions, women in non-disaster areas or lightly affected areas also launched mutual aid and mutual assistance movements. Liu Dianzhen, chairman of the Women's Federation of Dang Township, Hudong District, Shuyang County, took a Shao woman who was about to give birth and whose family had run out of food to her home, gave her a quilt to cover, and asked her grandmother to take care of her. After the child was born at home, she stayed for half a month before leaving. Because women cadres and women masses have made remarkable achievements in production and disaster relief, their social status has been improved. Among the 21 model cadres in Shuyang County who were commended in a circular for leading production and disaster relief, nine were women cadres; the head of the women's group in Siyang was elected as the chairman of the township women's association because she led the production and disaster relief and was supported by the masses. Men and women, old and young, in Chengnan District of Huaiyang all say, "The Women's Federation does a good job," and the prestige of the Women's Federation has also been improved.

　　苏北淮阴专区重灾区
    广大妇女生产自救
    【苏北讯】苏北重灾区之一的淮阴专区，在生产度荒的斗争中，广大妇女群众在该区民主妇联领导与帮助下，普遍参加了生产自救运动。淮阴专区去年被灾后，灾区人民生活相当艰苦。淮阴区民主妇女联合会，根据该区领导上所提的：“种家菜、挖野菜”，“三分粮、七分菜”的号召，在去年秋天曾普遍发动妇女种菜；冬天又发动了栽种寒菜，并号召妇女挖菜地，积肥料，准备今年春天种春菜。并及时协同当地政府解决了灾区没有菜种、缺乏劳动力、没有菜地的困难。发动淮阴、涟水、泗阳等地妇女募集菜种送给重灾区；帮助没有劳动力的家庭进行互助种菜，发动没有菜地的人家，在麦田里附带种菜。去年年底，据该专区九个县的统计，参加挖菜地的妇女有七万七千四百三十五人，挖地十四万三千六百十一亩。仅沭阳县双窑乡，今年即种春菜五百八十八亩，全乡四千三百八十二人，平均每人一分三厘菜地，可解决一个月的生活问题。妇联又根据“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”的原则，按各地具体条件，发动各地妇女参加各种副业生产。淮宝县发动妇女捕鱼虾，山羊区如意乡妇女李进香领导两个村妇女五十人捕鱼，得鱼四十担，换得大米十担，又把大米卖了，买了四十担米糠，五十个灾民每人分到八斗。此外并发动妇女磨粉、纺织、编织、榨油等副业。据六个县的不完全统计，参加编织席子、折子、蒲包等的妇女共有四千九百三十四户，九千六百三十一人。灌云一个村，每天每人平均可出席四张，赚粮四斤，还可落下草来烧，一家有一个人编席，即可养活四口人。沭阳双窑乡，全乡男女参加副业生产的共四千三百六十人，其中有妇女二千九百六十五人，占总数百分之六十八，克服了劳力缺乏的困难。为了响应政府救灾工作指示，非灾区或轻灾区的妇女，也都开展了互助互济运动。沭阳湖东区荡乡妇联会长刘殿贞，把一个将要分娩而家中已经断炊的邵姓妇女带回家去，给她被子盖，叫老奶奶照顾她，小孩子在家生下来后，又住了半个月才走。由于妇女干部和妇女群众在生产救灾中做出了显著成绩，因而提高了她们的社会地位。沭阳县通令表扬的二十一名领导生产救灾的模范干部中，九名是妇女干部；泗阳妇女小组长，因领导生产救灾得到群众拥护，被选为乡妇女会长。淮阳城南区的男女老少谈起来都说：“妇联会办事好”，妇联会的威信也提高了。
