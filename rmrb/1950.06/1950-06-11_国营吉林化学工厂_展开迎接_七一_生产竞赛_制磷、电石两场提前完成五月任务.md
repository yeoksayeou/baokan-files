State-owned Jilin Chemical Plant
Launches Production Competition to Welcome "July 1st"
Phosphorus Production and Calcium Carbide Production Workshops Complete May Tasks Ahead of Schedule
[Jilin News] According to the Jilin Daily, all employees of the state-owned Jilin Chemical Plant launched a heated production competition in May to complete the second quarter's production tasks ahead of schedule and to welcome and celebrate "July 1st" – the Party's birthday. The workshops and walls of each branch plant were covered with bright red and eye-catching slogans, writing the fighting goals of the workers. Thanks to the workers' active efforts, the phosphorus production and calcium carbide production workshops successively completed their monthly production tasks ahead of schedule on the 20th and 21st of May. The labor efficiency of the phosphorus production workshop increased by 78% compared to the previous month. All products met the specifications. The production efficiency of the calcium carbide production workshop increased by one-tenth compared to the previous month. On May 25th, the calcium carbide production had exceeded the factory's assigned task by 17%. The quality exceeded the standard specifications. The two workshops also saved a lot of raw materials in these twenty days. The cost was reduced compared to before. In order to do a good job in the competition movement, the factory's Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League closely cooperated, went deep into the workshops, and encouraged and helped the workers solve specific problems. Party branch and trade union cadres were always on the scene at the calcium carbide production workshop, helping workers to set competition plans and promoting the experience of advanced groups in the workshop. The administration used workshop production instruction charts to clearly point out the production progress and strictly implemented the production responsibility system and the inspection system for handover shifts. Each workshop specifically assigned and arranged work 15 minutes before going to work, and held production meetings 20 minutes after work to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the work. Lively propaganda and mobilization work was carried out around the competition. The more than eight-foot-high "Hall of Glory" was plastered with photos and model deeds of labor models. The trade union collected materials in a timely manner to write production quick reports for each workshop, promoting good working methods and experiences. Black and red flags and red and black dot recording activities were launched in the workshops. Workshops or individuals who completed the production tasks were given red flags and red dots; those who fell behind were given black flags and black dots. For units that completed their tasks, the administration, the Party, and the trade union used congratulatory letters and other methods to encourage and commend them. The trade union encouraged members to strive to join the Party with practical actions in the competition. These propaganda and mobilization efforts greatly improved the workers' production enthusiasm and further promoted the unity of technical personnel and workers.
