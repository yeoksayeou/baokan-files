[News from the Beijing Municipal News Office] The director and workers of the newly built municipal Beijing glass factory have successfully trial-produced antenna insulators and glass oil eyes. These two items have never been made in domestic glass factories and have always had to be purchased from abroad.

In early November of last year, the Central Telecommunications Bureau and the Broadcasting Administration Bureau approached the factory to order 7,000 high-frequency corrugated glass antenna insulators. These items require very high standards: high tensile strength, low expansion coefficient, and low metal content. According to the Telecommunications Bureau, they had previously used foreign products, and China had never made them before. Therefore, the factory agreed to try to produce them, but could not guarantee success.

There were no problems with the mixing of the materials, especially under the guidance of Director You Tong; the difficulty lay in the shaping process. The initial products always had a large upper eye and a small lower eye, which did not meet the specifications. Technicians Qiu Qicai and Li Derui spent all day working on the pressure machine and mold, trying to find a solution. They tried using different materials, but the result was still a large upper eye and a small lower eye. Therefore, the problem was neither with the material nor with the pressure. After studying the problem for several days, Li Derui suddenly remembered seeing American table lamp molds with needle-sized air vents when he was an apprentice twenty years ago; the current problem was probably that the mold was trapping air. However, it was impossible to drill such small holes in the mold using a blacksmith's shop; if the holes were too large, the material would leak out and the mold would be unusable. Finally, he came up with a solution: he hollowed out the four "pipe nails" in the mold and opened a small hole in the nail head, allowing the air to escape. As a result, the upper and lower eyes of the finished product were indeed the same size.

However, after a few days, another problem arose. This time, the upper eye was small and the lower eye was large. Li Derui studied the problem again for a long time and discovered that the "pipe nails" in the upper part of the mold were exposed to the glass solution first, and the heat they received was greater than the "pipe nails" in the lower part, so they burned out quickly and became thinner and thinner. Replacing the mold every few days would be too wasteful. Li Derui came up with a solution: he knocked out the "pipe nails" on the mold and replaced them with live screws, so that when they burned thin, he could simply replace the screws.

After the insulator was successfully tested, the Telecommunications Bureau sent two finished products to the Civil Engineering Department of Tsinghua University for tensile testing. The results showed that one had a tensile strength of 450 kilograms and the other had a tensile strength of 380 kilograms, which was completely sufficient (the tensile strength of the electric wire was only 260 kilograms). In terms of color, the iron content was lower than that of Japanese products, meaning that the insulation was even better than Japanese products.

Glass oil eyes are circular pieces of glass installed at the oil filling points of train axles, allowing one to see the amount of oil. These items must be of good quality and able to withstand high heat and vibration, otherwise they will easily break and become non-transparent. According to the Tianjin Railway Bureau, they had previously used foreign products, and domestic factories had never made them before. In January of this year, the Materials Department of the Tianjin Railway Bureau approached the factory, not to order oil eyes, but to give them old and discarded American oil eyes to melt down and remake. Factory Director You Tong agreed to try to make two types of oil eyes: one was a re-made product of foreign goods, and the other was a finished product made from the factory's own materials. Later, because the railway bureau's materials department sent too little broken glass, which was not enough for a pot, Director You only delivered the finished products made from the factory's own materials to the railway bureau for trial use. According to the notification from the Materials Department of the Railway Bureau, the trial results were good, and no cracks had occurred after twenty days. The factory also sent the stored oil eyes from the "Beizhi Glass Factory" (the factory's predecessor, built during the Japanese occupation of Beijing) for testing, and the result was that they could not be used.

### 新建玻璃厂厂长和工人试制天线绝缘子和玻璃油眼成功  工人阶级智慧无穷！

　　新建玻璃厂厂长和工人试制天线绝缘子和玻璃油眼成功
    工人阶级智慧无穷！
    【京市新闻处讯】京市市营新建玻璃厂的厂长和工人试制天线绝缘子和玻璃油眼成功。这两件东西都是国内玻璃厂从来没做过，一向都得到外国去买的。
    去年十一月初，中央电信总局和广播事业管理处找该厂定做七千个高周波波浪形玻璃天线绝缘子。这种东西，需要条件很高：拉力要大、膨胀系数要小、含的金属要少。据电信总局方面讲，以前用的都是外国货，我国自己从来没做过。所以该厂也答应试试看，能不能作出来，不敢保证。
    配料方面，在该厂尤其侗厂长指导下，还没有问题；困难在成形方面。最初做出的活，总是上眼大，下眼小，不合规矩。技工邱起才、李德瑞成天守着压力机和模子想办法。拿别种料来试，也是上眼大，下眼小。所以毛病不在料上，也不在压力上。研究了好几天，李德瑞忽然想起二十年前当学徒时，曾看见过师父们用的美国台灯模子，上面打的有针眼大的气眼；而现在的毛病、恐怕是模子里瞥住气了。但是找铁铺打眼，又打不了那么细，打粗了，又跑料，不能用。最后，他想了个办法，把模子里四截“管钉”掏空，在钉子头开个细口，气就跑出来了。结果作出来的活，上下两个眼，果然能一般大小了。
    可是过了几天又出了毛病。这回是上眼小，下眼大了。李德瑞又研究半天，发现上半部模子的“管钉”，因为先遇见玻璃溶液，受的热比下边的“管钉”大，所以烧坏的快，越来越细。要是用几天就换一回模子，又太浪费。李德瑞就想了个办法，把模子上的“管钉”打掉，换成活的螺丝钉，烧细了只要换个钉子就成了。
    绝缘子试验成功，电信总局把两个成品送到清华大学土木系去作拉力试验。结果，一个拉力达到四百五十公斤，一个是三百八十公斤，完全够用（电线拉力仅二百六十公斤）。从色泽来看，含铁量比日本货还低，也就是绝缘程度比日货还好。
    玻璃油眼是火车车轴加油处装置的圆形玻璃，可以从它看出机油多少的情况。这种东西，质地要好，能耐高热和震动，不然就容易破碎和不能透明。据天津铁路局方面讲，以前用的都是洋货，国内工厂从来没有做过。今年一月，天津铁路局机材处找到该厂，并不是订制油眼，而是把旧存的美国油眼废品，交他们溶化再制。该厂厂长尤其侗答应做两种油眼试试：一种是洋货再制品，一种是用该厂自料制的成品。后来因为铁路局机材处送来的碎玻璃太少，不够一锅，尤厂长就只把自料的制成品交路局试用。据铁路局机材处的通知，试用成绩良好，二十几天还没发生破裂现象。该厂也曾将库存的“北支硝子厂”（该厂前身、日寇占领北京时间所建）的油眼送去试验，结果是不能使用。
