　　Introduction to Three Tools for Eliminating Armyworms
    Qian Daosheng
    I. Armyworm Net
    Nail a wooden handle to a horizontal stick, forming a T-shape. Then, bend willow branches into four small hoops, sew a cloth bag onto each hoop, and attach them to both ends of the horizontal stick according to the width of the ridge. Place a small stone in each bag for use. (See figure)
    To use the armyworm net, hold the wooden handle and place the crops between the two bag hoops at the ends of the horizontal stick. Push forward along the ridge, shaking it as you go, so that the bottom of the net touches the millet stalks, shaking the worms off into the bags.
    II. Armyworm Boat
    One person carries two armyworm boats, using the crossbar on the boat handles to automatically press and strike the armyworms on the crops on both sides. The bottom of the boat is made of tinplate, five inches deep and about one foot wide, and can be customized according to the width of the ridge. (See figure)
    To use, a small wooden carrying pole two or three feet long is used to carry the two armyworm boats on the shoulders. Walk along the ridge, and one pass can remove insects from four ridges of millet seedlings. According to experienced people, each person can remove armyworms from ten or so mu of land per day.
    III. Animal-Powered Armyworm Capture Device
    This is a capture device newly designed last year by the Pest and Disease Group of the Gongzhuling Agricultural Experiment Station in Northeast China. This capture device has a wooden trough four and a half feet long, one foot seven inches wide at the top, and eight inches wide at the bottom, with skids installed underneath. A wooden platform is installed vertically inside the trough, with two columns attached to the platform. Two sets of wooden sticks, three feet long and at a sixty-degree angle, are attached to the columns. There is an eyelet for attaching livestock harnesses in the front and a handle in the back. (See figure)
    This device is pulled by livestock along the ridge furrow. The first set of wooden sticks presses the millet or wheat into the trough, and when it stands up again, it hits the second set of wooden sticks. The larvae on the millet, wheat, and other crops are shaken off into the wooden trough. The upper part of the trough has a baffle made of iron sheets to prevent the insects from crawling out.
    This capture device is very light and can simultaneously work on two ridges. It has a high efficiency in eliminating insects. One person and one animal can work on more than thirty mu of land per day.
    The size and width of the wooden trough listed above may not be consistent with the ridge width in various regions. Various regions can flexibly trial-produce and test them according to the local conditions based on this principle.

　　介绍三种除治黏虫的工具
    前刀生
    一、黏虫网
    在一根横棍上，钉上个木把，成丁字形。再用柳条弯成四个小圈，每个圈上缝个布袋，按垅的宽窄，按在横棍的两端，每个布袋里放上一块小石头就可使用。（见图）
    黏虫网的用法是手拿着木把，把庄稼放在横棍两端的两个布袋圈的夹缝里，顺垅往前推，随走随晃动，使网底碰谷子秆，把虫震下来，掉在布袋里。
    二、黏虫船
    一个人担着两个黏虫船，由船把上的阻棍自行压打两旁庄稼上的黏虫。船底是用洋铁片做的，深五寸，宽约一尺左右，可按垅的宽窄而制定。（见图）
    用法是用一条二、三尺长的小木担子，把两个黏虫船担在肩膀上，从一条垅背上走，一过去能够除四垅谷苗上的虫子。据有经验的人说，每人每天能除虫十来亩地的黏虫。
    三、黏虫畜力捕杀器
    这是东北公主岭农事试验场病虫组去年新设计的一种捕杀器，这种捕杀器是在长四尺半，上宽一尺七寸，下宽八寸的木槽下面安置橇脚，在槽底纵设一台木，在台木上按两个立柱，在立柱上按两组长三尺成六十度角的木棍，前有系牲口套的眼，后有把手。（如图）
    此器用牲口拉着在垅沟内行走，第一组木棍把谷或麦压到槽内，及至立起又打在第二组木棍上，谷、麦等庄稼上的幼虫受此震动即掉落木槽里，槽内上部有铁片制的挡板，使虫子不能爬跑。
    此种捕杀器重量很轻，同时能打两垅，除虫能率较高，一人一畜一天可打三十多亩地。
    上列木槽的大小宽窄，可能与各地的垅宽不一致，各地可根据此种原理，按当地情况灵活地试制试用。
