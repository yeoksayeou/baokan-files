　　State-owned Enterprises Provide Effective Support
　　Tangshan's Private Enterprises Gradually Recover
　　Kailuan, Qixin, and Huaxin Achieve Significant Progress in Production and Sales
　　[Tangshan News from this Newspaper] State-owned enterprises in Tangshan City have successively adopted effective support measures for private industrial and commercial enterprises through methods such as processing, ordering, purchasing and selling, and acting as sales agents, enabling them to maintain production and overcome difficulties on the basis of labor-capital coordination.
　　First, the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company signed contracts with Kailuan and Qixin to guarantee the sales of coal and cement. Since April, the Tangshan Coal Branch has vigorously promoted the sales and transportation of Kailuan coal and cement. By the end of the year, it is expected to reach more than 40% of Kailuan's annual output. The transportation and sales of cement reach 10,000 tons per month, accounting for 90% of Qixin's total production. After Huaxin Textile Factory signed a processing and sales contract with the North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the Tangshan Branch has been supplying Huaxin with sufficient raw materials on a monthly basis since March and guaranteeing the sales of all its products. As a result, the long-standing problems of sales channels and raw material supply for these three major factories and mines have been specifically resolved, production has increased, and labor-capital relations have also improved. For example, since Kailuan signed a contract with China Coal Industry Company, it can receive 150,000 bags of flour and cash for 20,000 tons of coal every month, solving the serious difficulty of Kailuan's arrears in employee wages, greatly improving the workers' production enthusiasm. The daily output in May reached more than 16,500 tons, exceeding the highest record in the six years since Japan's surrender. Qixin's cement production is also developing daily. For example, the output in March exceeded February and exceeded the March production plan by 35.78%. March and April were overhaul periods, and the cement output in April reached 12,400 tons. Huaxin exceeded its original production plan by 22% in April. With the workers' high production enthusiasm, the unreasonable wage system was initially reformed, and the "Zhong" shift was added. The factory is also planning to restore the second factory in the future, expand operations, and increase the number of looms.
　　At the same time, state-owned enterprises have also provided necessary support to small and medium-sized enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, can be maintained, and are currently encountering difficulties. From January to May of this year, various professional companies entrusted the following processing to small and medium-sized industries through processing business: 179,087 jin of peanut oil, 5,889 bolts of cotton cloth, 7,895 bolts of dyeing, 591 dozens of socks; 570 boxes of soap, 180 boxes of matches, 136 shirts, 349,685 jin of flour, 7,727,541 jin of sorghum rice, 2,690,865 jin of millet, 75,411 jin of corn flour. From January to April, the peanut oil entrusted by the Oils and Fats Company accounted for 68.2% of the total output of the vegetable oil industry during the same period, and the flour entrusted by the Grain Company accounted for 38.36% of the total output of the mechanized flour industry. Since the beginning of spring, 90% of the output of the grain processing industry has been entrusted processing products by the company. For private businesses, support is provided through agency sales, purchases, and other businesses. For example, the Grain Company developed more than 20 agency stores from January to May, and from January to April, it sold 4,106,000 jin of coarse grains, 287 bags of flour, and 29,730 jin of corn flour, with a commission of 3%. The Salt Company entrusted commercial firms to sell edible salt, with a daily agency sales volume of 1,500 jin, with a commission of 1.5%, and the gross profit was equivalent to more than 20 jin of salt. Five private stores have established agency sales relationships with the Oils and Fats Company, maintaining a profit of 1%. The company also acquired 200,000 jin of peanuts from private merchants in April through acquisition business. Other companies, such as the Coal Industry Building Materials Company, are also expanding the establishment of agency sales and processing businesses with private enterprises.
　　After expanding deposit business in April, it is planned to use 15% of deposits to support public and private enterprises. The loans of more than 200 million yuan in late May were purely to support private enterprises, and large-scale lending is also planned in June to maintain the production of private enterprises and overcome temporary difficulties.

　　国营企业进行有效扶植
    唐山私营企业逐渐恢复     
    开滦启新华新产销均有显著进展
    【本报唐山讯】唐山市国营企业，先后通过加工、定货、购销、代销、包销等方式，对私营工商业采取了有效的扶助办法，使能在劳资协调的基础上维持生产，克服困难。
    首先是中国煤业建筑器材公司与开滦、启新订立包销煤炭和洋灰的合同。唐山煤业支公司四月份以来，即大力进行销、运滦煤、洋灰，至年底止，可达开滦全年产量的百分之四十以上。洋灰运销每月达一万吨，占启新全部生产量的百分之九十。华新纺织厂与华北区花纱布公司签订加工包销合同后，唐山支公司自三月份起即按月供给华新足够的原料，并包销其全部产品。因而使该三大厂矿长期无法获得解决的销路、原料供给问题，都获得了具体解决，生产增加，劳资的关系也得到改善。如开滦自与中国煤业公司订立合同后，每月可得到十五万袋面粉，和两万吨煤的现款，解决了开滦拖欠职工工薪的严重困难，使工人生产情绪大为提高，五月份日产量曾达到一万六千五百余吨，超过了日本投降后六年来的最高纪录。启新洋灰产量亦日有发展，如三月份产量即超过二月份，并且超过了三月份生产计划百分之三十五点七八，而三、四月均值检修时期，四月份洋灰产量即达一万二千四百余吨。华新四月份即超过原生产计划百分之二十二，在工人生产情绪高涨下，初步改革了不合理的工资制度，增添了中字班，厂方还正在计划今后恢复第二厂，扩大经营，增加织机台数。
    同时，国营企业对于有益于国计民生、可能维持而目前遭遇困难的中、小企业，亦作了必要的扶植。今年一月至五月份，各专业公司通过加工业务，委托中、小工业加工计：花生油一七九、○八七斤，棉布五、八八九匹，染色七、八九五匹，袜子五九一打；肥皂五七○箱，火柴一八○箱，衬衣一三六件，面粉三四九、六八五斤，秫米七、七二七、五四一斤，小米二、六九○、八六五斤，玉米面七五、四一一斤。一至四月份油脂公司委托加工的花生油，占植物油业同期总产量的百分之六八点二，粮食公司委托加工面粉占机制面粉业总产量百分之三八点三六。入春以来，粮食加工业有百分之九十的产量系公司委托加工品。对于私营商业，则通过代售、收购等业务，加以扶助，如粮食公司一至五月份发展的代售商店即达二十余家，一至四月份代售粗粮四百一十万六千余斤，面粉二百八十七袋，玉米面二万九千七百三十余斤，代售手续费为百分之三。盐业公司委托商号代售食盐，每日代销量即达一千五百斤，以百分之一点五的手续费计，毛利折盐二十余斤。私营商店与油脂公司建立代销关系的有五户，利润保持百分之一，公司又通过收购业务，四月份收购私商花生即达二十万余斤；其他如煤业建筑器材公司亦正扩大与私营企业建立代销、加工业务中。
    四月份扩大存款业务以后，计划专以存款百分之十五扶植公私营企业，五月下旬二亿余万元的贷款，则纯系扶植私营企业，六月份也计划大批放款，以维持私营企业生产，克服暂时困难。
