The People's Supervisory Work
    By Our Reporter Bai Sheng

    "Within the people's governments at and above the county and municipal levels, people's supervisory organs shall be established to supervise whether the state organs at all levels and various public servants are performing their duties, and to expose and bring to justice those organs and personnel who violate the law or are derelict in their duties. The people and people's organizations have the right to accuse any state organ and any public servant of illegal or derelict conduct to the people's supervisory organs or the people's judicial organs." - Article 19 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    In Guantao County, Hebei Province, two district cadres, eager to complete the bridge construction task, cut down an ancient tree in Beiliuzhuang Village that the people had cherished for generations. When cutting down the tree, they did not consult with the masses properly or explain the situation. When villagers came out to negotiate and stop them, the district cadres threatened them with guns, causing anger among the villagers and creating a rift between the masses and the government. Someone reported this matter, and the case reached the people's supervisory organ. After the matter was dealt with, the responsible cadres were punished and made self-criticisms. The masses accepted the government's cordial consolation, and everyone felt that the people were truly the masters.

    A serious case of corruption and waste occurred in the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's water tower repair project. The supervisory team of the People's Supervisory Committee spent more than twenty days clarifying the facts and investigating the causes of the incident. The results of the handling were announced to the people of the whole country. This educates public servants throughout the country: Cherish state property! Be vigilant against bureaucracy!

    In the five months since its establishment, the Central People's Supervisory Committee has handled a total of 142 such cases, large and small. Some were filed by the people, some were assigned by the State Council, and some were reported by lower-level organs. Among these cases, the more significant ones, in addition to those mentioned above, include the Huachiying train collision, the Yiluo Coal Mine gas explosion, the Nanjing Dongshanqiao Forest Farm destruction, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant gas poisoning incident, the North China Oil Company loss incident, the Xingang Engineering Bureau corruption incident, the Yuehan Railway Leiluo Station train collision incident, and the Beijing Coal and Iron Company cadre corruption incident. In addition, they also inspected production and disaster relief work in various places, discovering and handling many problems. The handling of these cases not only corrected errors and improved work, but also educated the vast number of cadres and masses.

    The Central People's Supervisory Committee was established on the basis of the former North China Supervisory Court. It officially started work in January of this year. Its internal organization is divided into four departments: The First Department is in charge of the supervision of financial, banking, customs, cooperative trade, agriculture, forestry and land reclamation, water conservancy and other organs and their enterprises, as well as handling complaints against relevant public servants. The Second Department is in charge of the supervision of various industrial, railway, postal and telecommunications, transportation, labor and other organs and their enterprises, as well as handling complaints against relevant public servants. The Third Department is in charge of the supervision of political, legal, cultural, educational and other state organs and their enterprises that do not fall under the First and Second Departments, and handles complaints against relevant public servants. The Fourth Department is the General Office, mainly responsible for internal affairs.

    The People's Supervisory Committee not only handles cases that have already occurred, but also conducts in-depth investigations and research through each case to find the root causes of the events, so that state organs and their staff can avoid repeating mistakes, thereby improving work. For example, in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant gas poisoning incident, after the Supervisory Committee investigated, it clarified that the main reason for this incident was the lack of careful planning in engineering management, the lack of planning in the progress of the project, the lack of timely and regular inspections, and the unclear division of labor and responsibilities in factory management. There was no clear relationship or connection between superiors and subordinates and among various production organizations. As a result, a serious phenomenon of disorganization and lack of discipline was formed. This awakened the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to pay attention to improving all aspects of its work.

    In addition, the Supervisory Committee also took the initiative to send people to understand the work of certain departments, discover problems, and solve problems. For example, in April of this year, they sent personnel to join the Ministry of Finance in inspecting tax collection work in Beijing, discovered many problems in the work, and discovered thousands of cases of violations and tax evasion, thereby prompting the tax authorities to formulate methods for rectifying tax collection and strictly preventing tax evasion, which made a great contribution to increasing tax revenue. At the same time, they also successively participated in professional meetings convened by various government departments, which strengthened their connection with various departments and expanded and deepened the scope and depth of understanding the situation and discovering problems.

    In carrying out supervision and inspection work, they adopted a working line that closely integrates with the masses. For example, when they inspected the Huachiying train collision and the Yiluo Coal Mine gas explosion, they first mobilized the broad masses of workers to review their work, so that the top-down supervision work was combined with the bottom-up supervision work, achieving more comprehensive and in-depth results.

### 人民的监察工作

　　人民的监察工作
    本报记者  柏生
    “在县市以上的各级人民政府内，设人民监察机关，以监督各级国家机关和各种公务人员是否履行其职责，并纠举其中之违法失职的机关和人员。人民和人民团体有权向人民监察机关或人民司法机关控告任何国家机关和任何公务人员的违法失职行为。”——人民政协共同纲领第十九条。
    河北馆陶县八区的两个区干部，为了急于完成建桥任务，把北留庄全村人民多少代以来相传着珍爱着的一棵古老的大树砍伐了。伐树时没有好好和群众商量解释，村里群众出来交涉阻止，区干部们就开枪威吓，引起了全村群众的愤怒，造成了群众与政府的隔阂。村里有人把这件事报告上来，案件到了人民的监察机关。事情处理完了，负责的干部受了处分，检讨了错误。群众接受了政府亲切的抚慰，大家感到人民真正做主人了。
    郑州铁路局包修水塔发生了严重的贪污浪费事件。人民监察委员会的监察小组忙了二十几天，查清了事实的真相，追究了事件发生的原因。处理的结果向全国人民公布了。这教育着全国公务人员：爱护国家财产！警惕官僚主义！
    像这样大大小小的事件，中央人民政府人民监察委员会在成立以来的五个月中一共处理了一百四十二件。有的是由人民提出控告的，有的是政务院交办的，也有下级机关报告上来的。这些案件中，比较重大的，除了上述的那些案件外，还有花旗营撞车事件，宜洛煤矿瓦斯爆炸事件，南京东善桥林场破坏事件，石景山钢铁厂煤气薰死人事件，华北油脂公司损失事件，新港工程局贪污事件，粤汉路泪罗站的撞车事件，北京煤铁公司干部贪污事件等。此外，并检查了各地生产救灾工作，发现与处理了许多问题。这些案件的处理，不但纠举了过失，改进了工作，而且教育了广大干部和群众。
    中央人民监察委员会是在前华北监察院的基础上成立的。今年一月正式开始办公。它的内部组织分为四个厅：第一厅掌管关于财政银行、海关、合作贸易、农业、林垦、水利等机关及其企业部门的监察事项，以及处理有关公务人员的控诉案件。第二厅掌管关于各种工业、铁道、邮电、交通、劳动等机关及其企业部门的监察工作，以及处理有关公务人员的控诉案件。第三厅掌管关于政、法、文、教以及其他不属于第一、第二两厅的一切国家机关及其企业部门的监察事项和处理有关公务人员的控诉案件。第四厅是办公厅主要负责会内的事务。
    人民监察委员会不独处理已发生的案件，而且通过每一案件，进行深入的调查研究，找出事件的根源，使国家机关及其工作人员能够避免重复错误，从而改进工作。例如在石景山钢铁厂煤气薰死人事件中，监委会调查后，弄清了这次肇事的主要原因是在工程管理上没有周密的布置，工程的进行缺乏计划性，缺乏及时的与经常的检查，在工厂管理上分工不明，责任不清，上下级之间，各生产组织之间，无明确的关系及联系。因此形成了严重的无组织无纪律现象。这样，唤起了石景山钢铁厂对各方面工作改善的注意。
    此外，监委会还主动地派人深入了解某些部门的工作，发现问题，解决问题。例如今年四月，他们派员会同财政部检查了北京的税收工作，发现了工作中不少问题，发现了数千件违章漏税案，从而促使税务部门拟定了整理税收及严密防止漏税的办法，对增加税收的贡献很大。同时，他们又相继参加了政府各部门召开的专业会议，使他们与各部门的联系加强了，扩大了与加深了了解情况发现问题的范围和深度。
    在进行监督检查工作时，他们采取了与群众密切结合的工作路线。如他们检查花旗营撞车与宜洛煤矿瓦斯爆炸事件时，都是首先发动广大工人群众来检讨工作，这样使自上而下的监察工作与自下而上的监察工作结合起来，收到了更全面更深入的效果。
