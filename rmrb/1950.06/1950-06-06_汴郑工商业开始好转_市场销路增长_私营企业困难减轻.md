Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th: The markets in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou have gradually become more active since April. The temporary stagnation in market transactions that began in March has begun to improve.

In the new situation of stable prices, due to the smooth progress of social reform in rural Henan and the planned adjustment of urban industry and commerce, the people's purchasing power has gradually increased relatively. Therefore, a new trend has emerged in the market in April. Taking Zhengzhou as an example, the average daily amount of grain entering the market from April 6th to April 15th increased by approximately 60% compared to the average from March 26th to April 5th, while the volume of transactions increased twofold. In Kaifeng City, the transaction volume of agricultural products in April, except for soybeans and tobacco leaves, also greatly increased compared to March; and except for tung oil and tobacco leaves, the transaction volume exceeded the amount entering the market. The sluggish situation in the sales of industrial products has also begun to change. In Kaifeng in April, sales of the towel industry increased threefold compared to March, and the production and sales of knitwear, weaving, soap, as well as industrial products related to the people's livelihood such as public weaving factories and vegetable oil factories, have increased significantly compared to March.

Due to the increase in market sales, a new atmosphere has also emerged in industrial production. The Xin Yi Yarn Factory, which relocated to Zhengzhou, has recently found that its daily products cannot meet the demand. Therefore, the factory added spindles in April, increasing production by 14% compared to March, while sales increased by 65.61%. The industrial electricity consumption in Kaifeng City also increased from more than 43,000 kilowatt-hours in March to more than 59,000 kilowatt-hours in April, exceeding the amount during the price fluctuations in January. More than 200 blacksmith shops in Kaifeng City are now working day and night to produce wheat shovels and sickles to supply the needs of farmers for the wheat harvest.

Although these signs of improvement in industry and commerce are still only partial and not stable before the land reform in the entire province is fully completed and industry and commerce are adjusted, they indicate a good start for the prospect of economic recovery.

[Reported by this newspaper] According to Henan Daily: State-owned trading departments in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou are vigorously supporting private enterprises to maintain production through methods such as commissioned processing and purchasing finished products.

From April 25th to May 20th alone, the Kaifeng Department Store invested 1,179,420,000 yuan in RMB, placing orders, purchasing, or processing for industries such as leather, stationery, knitwear, cotton textiles, and Western medicine, which solved the sales and capital turnover difficulties of some industrial and commercial households. For example, the leather industry, where more than 20 factories were in a state of semi-shutdown, maintained production due to orders from the department store. In the cotton textile industry, 14 factories, including Zhenxing, Weiji, and Shenzifeng, accepted the company's commissioned processing to weave mosquito net cloth, which promoted and encouraged the improvement of product quality in the industry, and the Weiji factory also automatically added self-winding wheels to make the woven cloth tight and suitable. From late April to the first half of May, the Zhengzhou Department Store purchased more than 2,000 packages of Yongli Alkali, 1,100 boxes of glass, and fabrics, soap, red and white sugar, totaling 1,400,998,000 yuan. This played a considerable role in activating the market and overcoming the current recession.

The Kaifeng Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch purchased more than 2,205,000 dan of cotton in Bian, and exchanged yarn and cloth for more than 1,200 dan, solving the sales problem of cotton merchants, and also allocated more than 12,000 jin of raw cotton through commissioned processing to support the private Tiantong Yarn Factory to start production. On May 22nd, the Zhengzhou Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch also signed a two-month processing contract with the private Xinyi Yarn Factory to spin 600 pieces of 20-count yarn.

In addition, the grain, egg, and oil companies in Zhengzhou and Bian also provided appropriate care and support to private flour mills, egg factories, and oil pressing cooperatives based on the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests. At the same time, due to the purchases of various companies, the difference between the market price and the list price has also been appropriately adjusted.

　　汴郑工商业开始好转
    市场销路增长
    私营企业困难减轻
    【新华社开封四日电】开封、郑州市场四月份以来已逐渐趋于活跃，三月间开始的市场交易暂时呆滞的情况业已开始好转。
    在物价稳定的新局面下，由于河南农村社会改革的顺利进行与城市工商业的计划调整，人民购买力已相对地逐步提高。因此，四月份市场上便出现了一种新的迹象。拿郑州来说，四月六日到四月十五日平均每日粮食上市量已较三月二十六日到四月五日的平均数增加约百分之六十，而成交量则增加了两倍。开封市四月份市场农产品成交量除黄豆烟叶外，也均较三月份大有增加；且除桐油烟叶以外，成交量都超过上市量。工业品方面销路死滞的局面也开始变化。四月份开封的毛巾业销售量较三月份增加三倍，针织业、织布业、肥皂业以及公营织布厂、植物油厂等有关国民生计的工业品产销量均较三月份增加很多。
    由于市场销路的增长，工业生产方面也出现新气象。内迁郑州的新毅纱厂每日产品最近均感供不应求。因此，该厂四月份又增装纱锭，较三月份增产百分之十四，而销售量则增加了百分之六十五·六一。开封市的工业用电量也由三月份的四万三千多度增到四月份的五万九千多度，超过了一月份物价波动时期的度数。开封市两百多家打铁业现亦正日夜赶工，打造麦铲、镰刀，准备供应农民麦收需要。
    这些工商业情况好转的迹象，在全省土地改革尚未全部完成，工商业未行调整以前，虽还只是局部的、不够稳固的，但却为经济恢复的前途标明了良好的开端。
    【本报讯】据河南日报消息：开封、郑州两市国营贸易部门，正以委托加工、收购成品等方式，大力扶助私营企业维持生产。
    自四月二十五日到五月二十日止，仅开封百货公司就投放人民币十一亿七千九百四十二万元，先后对皮革、文具、针织、棉织、西药等行业进行了订货、收购或加工，解决了部分工商户的销路及资金周转的困难。如二十多家生产已陷于半停顿状态的皮革业，由于百货公司的订货，维持了生产。又如棉织业中，振兴、魏记、申子丰等十四家厂，接受了该公司的委托加工代织纹帐布，推动和鼓励了该业产品质量的提高，且魏记厂还自动添置了自卷轮，使所织纱布紧密适当。郑市百货公司从四月下旬到五月上半月，曾收购永利碱二千多包，玻璃一千一百箱，及布匹、肥皂、红白糖等，总共投放货币十四亿零九百九十八万元。这对于活跃市场，克服目前的萧条现象，起了相当作用。
    开封花纱布支公司曾在汴收购了二百二十万五千余担棉花，另以纱布交换回一千二百余担，解决了棉商的销路问题，同时又以委托加工方式拨出原棉一万二千余斤，支持了私营天同纱厂开工。郑市花纱布支公司亦于五月二十二日与私营新毅纱厂签订了两个月的加工合同，代纺二十支纱六百件。
    此外，郑、汴两市之粮食、蛋品、油脂等公司亦根据公私兼顾的原则，对私营面粉厂、蛋厂及榨油合作社加以适当的照顾和扶助。同时由于各公司的收购，使市价和牌价的差额亦得到适当的调整。
