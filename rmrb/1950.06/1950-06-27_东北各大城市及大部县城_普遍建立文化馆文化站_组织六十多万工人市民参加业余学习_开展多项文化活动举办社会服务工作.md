　　Northeast China's Major Cities and Most County Towns
    Universally Establish Cultural Centers and Stations
    Organize Over 600,000 Workers and Citizens to Participate in After-Work Study
    Carry Out Various Cultural Activities and Provide Social Services
    [By Our Newspaper] Major and medium-sized cities and most county towns in Northeast China have universally established people's cultural centers, achieving remarkable results in mass education. According to recent statistics, there are 214 people's cultural centers in Northeast China, in addition to 3 cultural palaces and 455 cultural stations. Of the people's cultural centers (palaces), 93 are located in the 24 directly administered and provincial-level cities in Northeast China, while the remaining 124 people's cultural centers are distributed in various counties and banners, accounting for approximately 74% of all counties and banners. The work of the people's cultural centers in various localities primarily focuses on conducting after-work supplementary education for workers and citizens: According to statistics, the people's cultural centers have established 817 workers' night schools, with 66,769 students; in addition, there are 6,283 mass night schools, with a total of 221,002 students; and 9,644 literacy classes, with 271,379 participants. Furthermore, 4,936 newspaper reading groups have been organized, with 50,141 participants. In total, the above-mentioned activities have absorbed over 609,000 workers and citizens to participate in various after-work studies, accounting for 8.3% of the total urban population of Northeast China.

    Secondly, carrying out cultural propaganda activities: People's cultural centers in various localities universally have reading rooms for newspapers and periodicals and publish wall newspapers and blackboards. For example, the Songjiang People's Cultural Center has established and leads a total of 2,934 blackboards, which published a total of 12,631 times in 1949. Most cultural centers are also equipped with microphones and loudspeakers for broadcasting propaganda; organize amateur theatrical troupes, Yangge dance teams, and propaganda teams; in addition, various exhibitions are held. For example, the 17 people's cultural centers in Shenyang City have organized a total of 49 amateur theatrical troupes and held 41 various exhibitions. Some local cultural centers have also assisted local governments in conducting sports and health campaigns. For example, the Anshan People's Cultural Center has organized workers' basketball, volleyball, and table tennis competitions.

    Thirdly, providing social services: People's cultural centers in various localities have carried out services such as writing letters and providing consultations. For example, the nine people's cultural centers in Harbin City handled a total of 21,320 instances of letter writing and consultations in 1949, averaging seven to eight times per day per center.

    Many people's cultural centers have also created some methods to go deep into the masses to carry out work: For example, the Tongtian District Cultural Center in Jilin City purchased a batch of popular books and used carts to deliver them to factories and streets for roving exhibitions. The Lüda People's Cultural Center organized reading groups in factories and streets, with group leaders taking books from the center for group members to read in turn, and then returning to exchange for new books after a certain period. The Shenyang People's Cultural Center also publishes blackboards in various factories and streets to facilitate mass reading.

    Over the past year, these organizational activities of the people's cultural centers have played a certain role in coordinating urban production and construction, timely publicizing current affairs and policies, inspiring workers' production enthusiasm, and improving the people's cultural, political, and production skills. At present, the following shortcomings still exist in the work of cultural centers in various localities:

    1. Some people's cultural centers do not have a clear enough work policy and fail to grasp the central focus. For example, the Chengde People's Cultural Center specializes in lectures for primary school students, but does not pay enough attention to urban workers and other working masses. Some local cultural centers have opened up "game rooms" in large rooms of the center for some idle people nearby to come to the center to play chess, but there are no rooms for running night schools and literacy classes.

    2. The leadership over the people's cultural centers in various localities is not yet unified, and some places do not pay enough attention to them. The propaganda departments of the party committees, educational administrative departments, literary federations, and trade unions in many places all manage the work of the cultural centers, making the staff of the cultural centers at a loss; sometimes, no one cares about them. Some areas provide very little concrete help to the cultural centers, and only scramble to handle things temporarily when something happens. For example, when there is a meeting, they call the cultural center to arrange the venue, and when there is an evening party, they call the cultural center to organize the program. The people's cultural center has become a "odd job man."

    3. Some people's cultural centers have not completely overcome the phenomena of "setting up an agency," "guarding a stall," and pursuing formalism, which prevent them from deeply connecting with the masses. The work is only carried out by a few cadres of the cultural center, and they are not good at seeking the assistance of relevant parties and organizing activists among the masses to carry out the work, so the work is not easy to carry out.

    4. Some local people's cultural centers have extravagant and wasteful phenomena, improper use of funds, and chaotic expenditures.

    These shortcomings are now being improved in accordance with the "Draft Outline of the Organizational Work of Cultural Networks in the Northeast Region" issued by the Northeast People's Government.

### 东北各大城市及大部县城  普遍建立文化馆文化站  组织六十多万工人市民参加业余学习  开展多项文化活动举办社会服务工作

　　东北各大城市及大部县城
    普遍建立文化馆文化站
    组织六十多万工人市民参加业余学习
    开展多项文化活动举办社会服务工作
    【本报讯】东北各大、中城市和大部分县城，普遍建立了人民文化馆，在开展群众教育方面已有显著成绩。据最近统计，全东北共有人民文化馆二百一十四处，另有文化宫三处、文化站四百五十五处。人民文化馆（宫）分布在东北二十四个直属市和省属市里的有九十三个，其余一百二十四个人民文化馆分布在各县、旗，占全部县、旗的百分之七十四左右。各地人民文化馆的工作，首先是举办工人与市民群众的业余补习教育：据统计，人民文化馆所举办的工人夜校共有八百一十七处，有学员六万六千七百六十九人；另有群众夜校六千二百八十三处，学员共二十二万一千零二人；识字班九千六百四十四处，有二十七万一千三百七十九人参加学习；另外还组织了四千九百三十六个读报小组，有五万零一百四十一人参加读报。上述各项合计共吸收了六十万九千余工人、市民群众参加各种业余学习，占全东北城市人口的百分之八点三。
    其次是开展文化宣传活动：各地人民文化馆普遍设有书报阅览室，出刊墙报和黑板报。如松江人民文化馆设立和领导的黑板报共有二千九百三十四块，一九四九年内共出一万二千六百三十一次。大部文化馆还设有麦克风和喇叭筒作播音宣传；组织了业余剧团、秧歌队、宣传队等；此外，并举办各种展览会，如沈阳市十七个人民文化馆，共组织了业余剧团四十九队，举办了各种展览会四十一次。有些地区的文化馆还协助地方政府进行了体育、卫生运动，如鞍山市人民文化馆曾组织过工人篮、排球以及乒乓球比赛。
    第三是举办社会服务工作：各地人民文化馆都进行了代笔问事等项工作。如哈尔滨市九个人民文化馆，一九四九年内共办代笔、问事二万一千三百二十次，平均每个馆每天要办七次到八次。
    许多人民文化馆还创造了一些深入群众进行工作的办法：如吉林市通天区文化馆，购买了一批通俗图书，用小车推着送到工厂和街道去巡回展览。旅大人民文化馆在工厂、街头组织了读书小组，由组长来馆取书，给组员轮流阅览，到一定时期再来换取新书。沈阳市人民文化馆并在各工厂和街头出黑板报，以便利群众阅览。
    一年多来，人民文化馆的这些组织活动，在配合城市生产建设，及时宣传时事和政策，鼓舞工人的生产情绪，提高人民文化、政治水平和生产技能等方面都起了一定的作用。目前，各地文化馆工作中还有下列几个缺点：
    一、有些人民文化馆的工作方针不够明确，抓不住中心。例如承德市人民文化馆，专门搞小学生讲座，但对城市工人及其他劳动群众却注意不够。有的地方文化馆用馆内很大房间开辟了“游艺室”，供附近一些闲散杂人来馆下棋游戏，但办夜校和识字班却没有房子。
    二、各地对人民文化馆的领导还不统一，有的地方则不够重视。许多地方的党委宣传部门、教育行政部门、文联、工会都管文化馆工作，使得文化馆工作人员无所适从；有时则各方面都不管。有的地区对文化馆的具体帮助很少，有了事情就临时乱抓。如开会时，就叫文化馆布置会场，搞晚会就叫文化馆给组织节目。人民文化馆变成了“打零杂”的。
    三、有些人民文化馆还没有完全克服“摆机关”、“守摊子”以及追求形式等不能深入联系群众的现象。工作只由几名文化馆干部唱独角戏，不善于争取有关方面的协助和组织群众中的积极分子来进行工作，因此工作不易开展。
    四、有些地方人民文化馆有铺张浪费现象，经费使用不得当，开支紊乱。
    这些缺点，现正根据东北人民政府颁发的《东北区文化网的组织工作试行纲要》，在改进中。
