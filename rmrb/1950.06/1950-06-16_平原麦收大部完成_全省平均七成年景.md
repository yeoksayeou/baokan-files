Xinhua News Agency, Xinxiang, 15th: The wheat harvest in Pingyuan Province is mostly complete. It is estimated that the small amount of late wheat can also be completely harvested before the 20th of this month. Farmers throughout the province are now working hard to thresh and dry the wheat, preparing it for storage. This year, the wheat field area in Pingyuan accounts for about 60 percent of the cultivated land area (80 to 90 percent in individual areas), about 10 percent more than last year. Although some areas suffered hail and jaundice, the average wheat harvest in the province is still at 70 percent of a normal year, with an average yield of about 80 jin per mu.

The wheat harvest order this year is extremely good. Before the wheat harvest, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government specifically issued instructions to protect the wheat, calling on all localities to earnestly protect the wheat harvest. Local troops, public security organs, and militia throughout the province formed a strong wheat protection team. They patrolled the fields day and night, enabling the wheat harvest to proceed smoothly and be completed quickly. During the wheat harvest, under the leadership of the People's Government, farmers in various localities organized large-scale mutual aid and exchange of labor according to the differences in the ripening time of wheat in disaster areas and non-disaster areas, and in mountainous areas and plains; or adjusted labor forces by means of mutually agreed contracts, effectively solving the difficulties of labor and animal power shortages in the wheat harvest. In addition, under the leadership of selection committees at all levels composed of agricultural farm cadres and experienced farmers, the masses of farmers universally carried out field selection of seeds.

　　平原麦收大部完成
    全省平均七成年景
    【新华社新乡十五日电】平原省麦收已大部完成。少数晚麦估计在本月二十日前亦可全部收割完毕。全省农民现正紧张地进行麦子的打晒，准备入仓。平原今年麦田面积约占耕地面积的百分之六十（个别地区占百分之八十到九十），比去年多百分之十左右。虽有个别地区遭受雹灾和黄疸病害，但全省平均麦收也有七成年景，每亩平均产量八十斤左右。
    今年的麦收秩序极为良好。麦收前平原省人民政府曾特地发出护麦的指示，号召各地认真保护麦收。全省各地方部队、公安机关和民兵组成了强大的护麦队伍。他们日夜在田间巡逻，使麦收工作得以顺利进行和迅速完成。麦收中，各地农民在人民政府的领导下，根据灾区与非灾区、山地与平原麦熟时间的早晚的差别，组织了大互助换工；或以互订合同的办法调剂劳动力，有效地解决了麦收中劳、畜力缺乏的困难。此外，农民群众在各地农场干部和老农组成的各级选种委员会的领导下，普遍进行了田间选种。
