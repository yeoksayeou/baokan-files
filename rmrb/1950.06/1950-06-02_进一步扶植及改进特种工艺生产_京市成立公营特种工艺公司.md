    Beijing's special handicrafts are the crystallization of the working people's artistic talents, with strong national characteristics and a long history, and have always been sold overseas. At present, there are nearly 2,000 workshops in Beijing engaged in special handicrafts, with more than 7,000 workers; according to the industry, there are 22 kinds, including: enamel, copper and tin, porcelain firing, silver blue, ivory, drawnwork embroidery, inlay (gilt lacquer, wood lacquer), filigree, stone and wood carving, jade ware, glass ware, carpets, embroidery, jade tree bonsai, carved lacquer, bone ware, velvet and silk paper flowers, murals, fireworks, toys, palace lanterns, iron flowers, etc. After the liberation of Beijing, the People's Government, in accordance with the policy of support, held many symposiums with representatives of the industry and experts who have studied special handicrafts. In addition to giving due and possible guidance in pattern design and production direction, and giving consideration to tax revenue, it also provided necessary loans through the Bank of China. With the help of the government, the production of special handicrafts in Beijing has been initially restored. In the first half of last year, the value of export products with statistics was about 780,000 US dollars. Although the first, second, third and fourth months of this year were the off-season for the sale of products in this industry, the total value of products sold overseas has exceeded 400,000 US dollars.
    The Special Handicraft Company, established to further support the production of this industry, has purchased finished products from various special handicraft workshops worth 60 million yuan during the preparation period, and Harbin Department Store has also purchased a batch of small glass ware and toys. Obviously, the establishment of this company will be of great help to the production and sales of special handicrafts in Kyoto City in the future.

　　进一步扶植及改进特种工艺生产
    京市成立公营特种工艺公司
    【京市新闻处讯】公营北京市特种工艺公司业已筹备就绪，地址设在崇文门内大街五十九号，于六月一日正式开幕。该公司主要工作内容是：改善并加强特种工艺品的图案设计与技术指导，做到产品实用，美观，质高价廉的地步。并做一部分加工订货，供给原料，收购成品，推广销路的业务，供应国外市场特别是社会主义苏联与东欧新民主主义国家市场的需要。
    北京特种手工艺是劳动人民发挥艺术才能创造的结晶，具有浓厚的民族色彩与悠久历史。一向行销海外。目前北京经营特种手工艺的作坊近两千户，工人七千多名；按行业有二十二种，包括：珐琅、铜锡、烧瓷、银蓝、象牙、挑补花、镶嵌（金漆、木漆）、花丝、石木雕刻、玉器、料器、地毯、刺绣、玉树盆景、雕漆、骨器、绒绢纸花、壁画、花炮、玩具、宫灯、铁花等。北京解放后，人民政府本扶植的方针，曾多次与该行业等的代表及对特种手工艺有研究的专家们举行座谈。除在图案设计，生产方向上给以应有与可能的指导，税收方面给以照顾外，并通过中国银行给以必要的贷款。在政府的帮助下，京市特种手工艺的生产得到了初步的恢复，去年大半年中，出口产品有数字可统计的约值七十八万美元，今年一、二、三、四四个月中，虽值该业产品行销淡季，产品行销海外的总值亦已超过四十万美元。
    为进一步扶植该业生产而成立的特种工艺公司，在筹备期间已收购各特种手艺作坊价达六千万元的成品，并有哈尔滨百货公司购去一批小料器与玩具。显而易见，这个公司的成立，对今后京市特种工艺品的产销将有很大帮助。
