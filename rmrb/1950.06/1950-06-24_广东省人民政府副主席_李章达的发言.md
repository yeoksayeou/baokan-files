Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Speech by Li Zhangda, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The full text is as follows: Chairman, Vice Chairmen, Committee Members, Comrades:

Our great revolution succeeded, and all of China was liberated. This was achieved thanks to the correct and great leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and the heroic and skilled fighting of our powerful People's Liberation Army. In the future, we will build a new China, and we can be proud of this meeting today, and it is an honor for all comrades to participate.

This conference was solemnly convened under the leadership of Chairman Mao. We have heard the reports from the responsible leaders, which are the first important reports presented to the National Committee since the establishment of our Central People's Government. Among the most important are: First, land reform was mentioned, which is to liberate the vast rural productive forces, develop agricultural production, and provide a foundation for the industrialization of the new China. Second, the adjustment of public-private relations and fiscal taxation was mentioned, which shows that we have indeed implemented the unified financial and economic policy, the rational burden policy, the streamlining and economy policy, and the public-private balance policy, so that the recovery and development of industry and commerce throughout the country, and the balance of national revenue and expenditure, will certainly be able to move the economic situation from a good start to a consolidated one. Third, in terms of politics, it was pointed out that the current domestic and international situation is developing favorably for us, which greatly enhances the patriotism of the people across the country, cherishes the motherland, strengthens the unity of the people across the country, seeks progress in unity, and strengthens the confidence of the people across the country in carrying out the cause of safeguarding peace and democracy, and resolutely implements the long-term friendly cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union to safeguard world peace. Fourth, in terms of military affairs, we are very happy to know that our motherland will establish a new and powerful army, navy, and air force to consolidate national defense and ensure that our country is not invaded by imperialism. These particularly important reports, which were correctly and appropriately put forward by the responsible leaders of our Central Government today, are fully in line with the interests of the people across the country. The people across the country are of course very excited and feel satisfied, especially the people of Guangdong will be greatly encouraged. I would like to express my wholehearted and resolute support for the above-mentioned reports on behalf of the people of Guangdong Province, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, I am willing to strive to achieve these resolutions. We must achieve the goal of building a new China and a new Guangdong.

Since the liberation of Guangdong and the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, the people and the government of the province have closely united and cooperated. In addition, with the cooperation of the military and civilians, and the cooperation of the military and government, we have been working hard to do what we should do under the leadership and instructions of the Central Government, with the two major tasks of consolidating public security and restoring production as the center, and carrying out various tasks. Recently, our heroic People's Liberation Army liberated Hainan Island, and the people of the province rejoiced and our work has developed more smoothly. At present, Guangdong has a special feature, that is, it is too close to Hong Kong and Macau, the two Far East outposts of imperialism, so the struggle between the people of Guangdong and imperialism is particularly sharp. Where is this struggle manifested? On the one hand, it is manifested in their collusion and indulgence of special agents, bandits, and spies to carry out sabotage, so that we cannot but increase the degree of suppressing reactionaries. On the other hand, it is manifested in the financial struggle, that is, the issue of Hong Kong currency circulating in the mainland and smuggling and tax evasion, which is a major economic loophole. The amount of Hong Kong currency flowing into Guangdong is about 200 million yuan, and smuggling is rampant. This kind of imperialist economic aggression has caused great damage to the people of Guangdong, and the people of the province are helping the government to deal with this problem. The government has ordered the prohibition of the use of Hong Kong dollars and strengthened anti-smuggling work. The people are happy to accept the government's methods, and there is no question that we will achieve victory. Chairman Mao told us: Fight to achieve a basic improvement in the national economy. The people of Guangdong accept Chairman Mao's words and are determined to plug this economic loophole in Guangdong. Therefore, the people of Guangdong Province, in the course of the struggle against imperialism, will take out their utmost sincerity, utmost courage, utmost determination and confidence to support the reports made by the central leaders and to support the resolutions of the conference, and to strive for their realization.

Finally, on behalf of the people of Guangdong Province, I would like to pay tribute to Chairman Mao, and wish Chairman Mao and all comrades of the conference good health!

　　广东省人民政府副主席
    李章达的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】广东省人民政府副主席李章达在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言。全文如下：主席、各位副主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我们伟大的革命成功，全中国解放，这是由于毛主席和中国共产党正确而伟大的领导并由于我们强大的解放军英勇善战而获得的。今后我们要建设新中国，我们今天这个会是很可以骄傲的，来参加各位同志都是很光荣的。
    这次大会，很隆重地在毛主席领导工作之下而召开了。我们听到各位负责首长的报告，这是我们中央人民政府成立以来，在全国委员会提出的头一次的重要报告。其中最重要的有几项：第一、提到土地改革，这是为了解放广大农村生产力、发展农业生产、使得新中国工业化有了基础。第二、提到调整公私关系和财政税收，这可以看出我们确实贯彻了财经统一政策，贯彻了合理负担政策，贯彻了精简节约政策，贯彻了公私兼顾政策，使得全国工商业恢复和发展，国家收支做到平衡，一定能够把经济局面从开始好转走到巩固好转。第三、提到政治方面、指出当前国内国外形势对我们有利的发展，就这大大地提高了全国人民的爱国心，爱护祖国，加紧了全国人民一致团结，并在团结中求进步，加强了全国人民对于进行保卫和平民主事业的信心，坚决实行中苏两大民族长期友好合作以保卫世界和平。第四、提到军事方面，我们很高兴地知道我们祖国将要建立新的强大的陆海空国防军，巩固国防。保证我们国家不受帝国主义侵略。这些特别重要的报告，今天由我们中央各位负责首长很正确的很适当的提出来，这完全符合全国人民的利益的。全国人民当然很兴奋的感觉到满意，尤其是广东人民会受到很大的鼓励。我谨代表广东全省人民对于上述几项报告全心全意表示坚决拥护。并在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，愿意为实现这些决议而奋斗。务必达到建设新中国建设新广东这样一个目的。
    广东解放后，广东省人民政府成立以来，全省人民和政府紧密团结合作，再加之军民合作、军政合作，在中央领导和指示之下努力做自己应该做的工作，把巩固治安和恢复生产这两大任务为中心，进行各种工作。最近我们英勇解放军把海南岛解放了，全省人民欢欣鼓舞，我们的工作更加顺利发展。目前广东情况有个特点，那就是太靠近了香港、澳门这两个帝国主义的远东前哨，因此广东人民与帝国主义斗争特别尖锐。这斗争表现在那里呢？一方面表现在他们勾搭和放纵特务土匪间谍肆行捣乱，使我们镇压反动不能不提高程度。另一方面表现在金融斗争，那就是香港币流通内地和走私漏税问题，这是一个经济大漏洞。香港币流入广东的数目，大约有两万万元，走私活动很猖獗，这种帝国主义经济侵略，给广东人民的损害很大，全省人民正在帮助政府处理这个问题。政府曾经下令禁止行使港币，并加强缉私工作，人民乐于接受政府的办法，我们取得胜利是不成问题的。毛主席告诉我们：为争取全国经济基本好转而斗争。广东人民接受毛主席这一句话，决心把广东这一个经济漏洞来堵住。因此广东全省人民在进行对帝国主义斗争当中，拿出万分诚意，万分勇气，万分决心和信心来拥护这次中央各位首长所提的报告，和拥护大会决议，并为它的实现而奋斗。
    最后，我代表广东全省人民谨向毛主席致敬，并祝毛主席和大会全体同志们健康！
