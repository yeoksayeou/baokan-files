American imperialism continues to persecute the Japanese Communist Party

The American and Japanese reactionaries are continuing their frantic offensive against the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people, according to a pre-determined plan. After MacArthur, the American dictator in Japan, ordered the Japanese Yoshida government on the 6th to "purge" all 24 members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, he ordered the Yoshida government on the 7th to purge 17 people, including employees of the JCP's newspaper, *Akahata*, and JCP member of parliament, Tatsuki Katsumi. Mass arrests of Japanese communists and other patriots have begun, and the dark plot to declare the Communist Party illegal is being accelerated. The white terror of American imperialism has spread throughout Japan.

This time, American imperialism directed its Japanese lackeys to launch an open and barbaric offensive against the Japanese people. This is a continuation of American imperialism's reactionary policy of enslaving the Japanese people. In the five years of the American occupation of Japan, the Japanese people have been subjected to ferocious oppression, devastation, trampling, and persecution. As early as May 1946, when strikes and slowdowns by Japanese workers demanding wage increases were surging, MacArthur publicly issued a violent statement interfering with the freedom to strike. In September of the same year, MacArthur approved the Yoshida government's promulgation of the "Labor Relations Adjustment Law," openly interfering with the Japanese working people's right to strike. Since then, decrees undermining the democratic rights of the people have followed one after another. In November and December 1948, the Japanese reactionary government passed amendments to the National Public Service Law and implemented the Public Corporation Labor Relations Law, prohibiting civil servants and employees of public corporations from staging general strikes and depriving civil servants of the freedom to speak, demonstrate, and march. In addition, a series of fascist decrees were promulgated, such as the "Public Security Ordinance" to suppress people's gatherings and demonstrations, the so-called "Group Regulation Order" to persecute progressive people's organizations, and the "Basic Law on Education" and "Teacher Qualification Examination Law" to exclude freedom of academic thought in schools. The American and Japanese reactionaries' restrictions, oppression, and persecution of the Japanese Communist Party, the loyal defender of the rights of the Japanese people, have also been long-standing, and have intensified, especially since last year. In March last year, the Japanese House of Representatives decided to establish a so-called "Special Investigation Committee," similar to the American "House Un-American Activities Committee," specifically to deal with the Japanese Communist Party. In July of the same year, the Japanese reactionary authorities fabricated the "Shimoyama Incident" and the "Yama-inu Incident" in an attempt to frame the JCP and create a pretext for declaring the JCP illegal. The slander and libel against the JCP, and the searches and arrests of JCP organs and communists, are even more commonplace.

The hostile policy adopted by American imperialism towards the Japanese people and the Japanese Communist Party endangers the interests of the Japanese people and threatens their survival. Therefore, the Japanese people, united under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, oppose this evil policy and demand an overall peace treaty, and demand freedom, independence, and liberation. The rising people's movement in Japan has become a serious obstacle to American imperialism's policy of transforming Japan into a colony and a base for aggressive war. To clear this obstacle in the path of American imperialism's aggressive policy, that is the real motivation for American imperialism and its Japanese lackeys' brutal persecution of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people this time.

However, this naked fascist action by the American and Japanese reactionaries, although it may cause some difficulties and setbacks to the Japanese people's movement, will not only fail to subdue the Japanese people's just struggle, but will inevitably cause more serious consequences. The Japanese working people are rising up to oppose this repressive measure by American imperialism and its Japanese lackeys. The Japanese Communist Party has declared its oath to fight the anti-communist conspiracy to the end, "If one person is arrested, ten will rise up" (as stated by Ito Ritsu, member of the JCP Political Bureau). At the same time, this vicious atrocity by the American and Japanese reactionaries will powerfully educate the Japanese people, making them more clearly recognize the hideous true face of American imperialism, and making them understand all the more that under the occupation rule of American imperialism, it is completely impossible for the Japanese people to gain liberation. From now on, whatever "democracy" American imperialism mouths will become the most hateful word among the broad masses of the Japanese people. Even the Christian Science Monitor, one of the American bourgeois opinion organs, cannot but worryingly state about this crackdown on the Japanese Communist Party: this cannot become "a good example of democracy."

### 美帝继续迫害日共

　　美帝继续迫害日共
    美日反动派正在按照预定步骤，继续向日本共产党和日本人民进行疯狂的进攻。美国在日本的独裁者麦克阿瑟，在六日命令日本吉田政府“整肃”日共中央委员会全体委员二十四人以后，又于七日下令吉田政府整肃日共机关报赤旗报职员和日共议员听涛克己等十七人。对日本共产党人和其他爱国分子的大逮捕，已经开始，宣布共产党为非法的黑暗勾当，正在加紧进行。美帝国主义的白色恐怖，已经弥漫日本全国。
    美帝国主义这次指使其日本走狗向日本人民实行公开而野蛮的进攻，乃是美帝国主义执行奴役日本人民的反动政策的继续。在美国单独占领日本的五年当中，就一直对日本人民实行凶恶的压迫、摧残、蹂躏和迫害。远在一九四六年五月，当日本工人要求增加工资的罢工怠工运动风起云涌之时，麦克阿瑟即公开发表了干涉罢工自由的暴戾声明。同年九月，麦克阿瑟批准吉田政府发布了“劳动关系调整法”，公开干涉日本劳动人民的罢工权利。从此以后，摧残人民民主权利的法令，接踵而至。一九四八年十一月和十二月，日本反动政府通过了国家公务员法的修正案，实施了公共企业劳动关系法，禁止公务员和公共企业的职工实行总罢工，剥夺公务员讲演、示威游行等自由权利。此外，还颁布了一系列的法西斯法令，如取缔人民集会、示威的“治安条例”，迫害进步人民团体的所谓“团体规正令”，排斥学校学术思想自由的“教育基本法”、“教员资格审查法”等等。美日反动派对日本人民权利的忠贞保卫者日本共产党的限制、压迫和迫害，也由来已久，特别自去年以来，更变本加厉。去年三月，日本众院决议设立了类似美国“非美活动委员会”的所谓“特别考查委员会”，专门对付日本共产党。同年七月，日本反动当局制造了“下山事件”和“山鹰事件”，企图嫁祸日共，制造宣布日共为非法的借口。对日共的诬陷、诽谤，对日本共产党机关和共产党人的搜查、拘捕，更属常事。
    美帝国主义对日本人民和日本共产党采取的这种敌视政策，危害着日本人民的利益，威胁着日本人民的生存。因此，日本人民在日本共产党的领导下团结起来，反对这一罪恶政策，要求全面媾和，要求自由、独立和解放。日本国内日益高涨的人民运动，变成了美帝国主义推行变日本为殖民地和侵略战争基地这一政策的严重障碍。为了扫清美帝国主义侵略政策途中的这一障碍，这就是美帝国主义及其日本走狗这次残酷迫害日本共产党和日本人民的真实动机。
    可是，美日反动派这一次赤裸裸的法西斯行动，虽然可能使日本人民运动遭受某些困难和挫折，但是这不但不能压服日本人民的正义斗争，而且必将造成更严重的后果。日本劳动人民正在奋起反对美帝及其日本走狗的这一镇压措施，日本共产党已声明誓与反共阴谋斗争到底，“一个人被抓，就有十个人起来”（日共政治局委员伊藤律语）。同时，美日反动派的这次凶恶的暴行，将有力地教育日本人民，使他们更加认清美帝国主义狰狞的真面目，使他们更加懂得在美帝的占领统治之下，日本人民要得到解放是完全不可能的。从今以后，美帝国主义口中的什么“民主”，将在日本广大人民中变成最可憎恶的字眼。这就连美国资产阶级的言论机关之一的基督教科学箴言报，对此也不能不忧虑地表示：对日本共产党的这一镇压行动，不能成为“民主的好榜样”。
