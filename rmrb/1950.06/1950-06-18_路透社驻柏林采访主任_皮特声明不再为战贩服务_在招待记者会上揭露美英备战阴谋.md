Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 13th (TASS): John Peet, Reuters Berlin Bureau Chief, held a reception for German and foreign journalists on June 12th at the Press Office of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin. He issued a statement saying that he would no longer serve the warmongers. Peet said that he would subsequently request protection from the German Democratic Republic.

John Peet's statement to the press stated in brief: I stand here because I can no longer serve the warmongers. As a Western journalist, and in my capacity as Reuters Berlin Bureau Chief, I have involuntarily and unintentionally become a tool of the US-controlled war machine.

Today, this is precisely the tragic and humiliating fate of most Western journalists who serve newspapers that have become mouthpieces of the warmongers.

As a British patriot, democrat, and friend of peace, I can no longer continue down this road. If anything else was needed to convince me of this, the last thing was the fabricated propaganda published in the US and British newspapers about the Free German Youth League's national congress.

Each of you knows, or should know, that the aim of the US and British occupation policy is to turn West Germany into a staging ground for a new war. The re-militarization of West Germany is being accelerated, although not a word has been said about it publicly. Recently, Atlantic Pact chiefs of staff, Bradley suggested bringing West Germany into the military Atlantic Pact "based on purely military motives." I now quote a dispatch from the German News Agency in Washington, which states: "In any case, Germany's enormous industrial capacity will strengthen the West's defense."

At the same time, the Western occupying powers have also re-authorized West German companies to manufacture weapons and poison gas.

You all know these facts very well. Perhaps you do not yet know the role played by British officers in establishing the new German army.

A few days ago, when General Keightley, British Commander in the Rhine, was in Berlin, I had cocktails with him. During our conversation, he frankly said: "I have discussed all of this with Monty (Field Marshal Montgomery), and he completely agrees with me that a German army must be established as quickly as possible. Some stupid politicians are still against it, but that won't last long now."

His tone made it very clear that he often talked about this in officers' clubs and in formal conversations. He believed that if he talked about this in the British Press Club, he would find many who agreed with him.

The consistent US policy of instigating war in the world, especially in Germany, is sometimes obscured by the fact that Britain often still wants to pursue an independent policy, not, of course, because the current British government is a peace-loving government, but usually to protect the interests of capitalists.

The historical, democratic, and progressive stance taken by most of the British people prevents the government from openly launching a war.

The recent Schuman Plan is a particularly obvious example, which is nothing more than a plan to adjust the configuration of Western European war potential.

The British government and the British steel magnates are afraid of the competition from this mining consortium supported by US capital.

Because Britain stubbornly closes off all opportunities for cooperation with the peace-loving Soviet Union and the people's democracies, the increasing pressure from the US may force the British government to participate, disregarding British interests.

This US pressure and US contact can be fully illustrated by the British occupation policy. I only need to give one example that I know myself: from July 1st, foreign journalists in West Germany will be treated "the same as Germans," meaning they can no longer claim confiscated houses, military rations, and cheap gasoline. However, a special decision was made for British journalists in Berlin, because General Bourne, the British Commander in Berlin, told us that we were considered "an important component of the occupying forces." Under this decision, British journalists will retain their previous privileges, such as the right to obtain free cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, etc. For some reason, the Americans did not like this special decision, even though it only concerned about twenty people in total. We heard that this special decision has been cancelled "due to American opposition."

This is just a small and insignificant example in this regard, proving that the once proud and independent British Empire now listens to the Americans in everything it does.

You may ask, what does all this have to do with the press conference I am giving here, in the democratic zone of Berlin? By the way, I made this decision not because I received "Russian money," or because I was influenced by taking "mysterious Asian drugs."

I said at the beginning that I do not intend to participate in the propaganda that provokes war any longer, the propaganda that not only threatens the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, but also deliberately wants to turn my country, my England, into a US colony.

Peet emphasized that journalists in the capitalist newspapers have no opportunity to report objectively. He continued: Experience has made it increasingly clear to me that honest reporting, such as honest reporting on all the progress in the German Democratic Republic, will never be published in those newspapers.

Every imaginary piece of news that I reported to the Daily Telegraph (a British newspaper specially allowed to be published in Berlin) was published in the British newspapers, while the refutations of these slanders are practically never seen.

Here, I want to cite one particular example. General Bourne, the British Commander in Berlin, spoke at a press conference before the German Youth Congress, on the one hand, talking about the Western countries' crazy countermeasures against the imaginary "Communist rebellion," and on the other hand, also pointed out with resentment that "the East German economy has made significant achievements." This sentence was said by a senior British official, which is an extraordinarily important confession, and I commented on it accordingly. The next day, every British newspaper published General Bourne's remarks about the armed threat in the most prominent position. However, his remarks about the economic achievements of the German Democratic Republic were omitted.

My respectable colleagues in the Western press, who have not yet sold their bodies and souls to the warmongers, each of you can probably collect hundreds more examples of this kind.

My two colleagues from The Times and the Daily Telegraph, in their dispatches reporting on the May Day celebrations, carelessly said: The East Zone People's Police showed great discipline on Potsdam's May Square, West Zone thugs threw stones, and the Sturm (police chief of the West Berlin district - translator's note) police turned a blind eye.

The next day, both of them were reprimanded by the British senior authorities, saying that their reports "endangered the British position in Berlin."

The Daily Telegraph reporter said in a dispatch on Pentecost: The German youth demonstration left a strong impression. Perhaps "coincidentally," he soon learned that he was to be transferred back to the London newspaper office.

I think it is unnecessary to waste time reporting on the German Youth Congress in more detail. Every journalist in Berlin knows how shamelessly the Western newspapers smeared this grand peace demonstration. Every stupid "dispatch from our reporter" in the Daily Telegraph and any other newspaper of the same kind, every warmongering cry from Schumacher for tanks, was published in newspapers all over the world. But, for example, I had already reported in March that there would be a demonstration of all the youth in the German democratic zone, and that there was no intention of planning a rebellion at all. I then received an angry telegram from London, telling me that other reporters had issued "thorough reports on the conspiracy plans for rebellion," and asking me why I did not make the same report.

I am a peace-loving person, and I can no longer supply the warmongers with weapons. Thirteen years ago, in order to fight for peace and a better world, I went to Spain as an ordinary British democrat to fight in the ranks of the International Brigade. Later, the democratic forces were defeated on that battlefield, but we will surely win the victory in the struggle for peace, and this struggle is now in full swing.

Every Western journalist, if he is an honest person, can only smile bitterly at the so-called Western freedom of the press. There is only a freedom for warmongers there. We are paid to supply them with a kind of false report that they like.

But we do not have the freedom to fight for peace, the freedom to report the actual situation truthfully. It is precisely for this reason that I have made this decision today, regardless of the personal consequences I may encounter as a result.

I am sure that the day will eventually come when all journalists will no longer serve as the fountain pens of the warmongers as they do today, but will become upright and dignified people.

John Peet finally answered the questions raised by the reporters. When asked if he was a communist, he specifically stated in response to this question that he was not a communist.

An Associated Press reporter asked him if he still worked for Reuters. Peet replied that, until this moment, he was still the Reuters Berlin Bureau Chief, and that he would send a telegram to Reuters in London reporting on this press conference.

　　路透社驻柏林采访主任
    皮特声明不再为战贩服务
    在招待记者会上揭露美英备战阴谋
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林十三日电：路透社驻柏林采访主任约翰·皮特六月十二日曾在柏林德意志民主共和国新闻处内招待德国及外国的记者。他发表声明说他不再为战争贩子服务了。皮特说，他随后将向德意志民主共和国请求保护。
    约翰·皮特向记者发表的声明略称：我站在这个地方，因为我不能再为战争贩子服务了。作为一个西方的新闻记者，同时在我的职务上作为路透社驻柏林的采访主任，我曾不由自主地而且不是出于本意地变成了美国所控制的战争机构的工具。
    在今天，这正是大多数为那些已成为战争贩子喉舌的报纸服务的西方新闻记者的悲惨而屈辱的命运。
    作为一个英国的爱国者、民主分子与和平的友人，我不能再继续走这一条路。如果还需要什么事情来使我相信这一点的话，那末最后的一件事便是美英报纸上关于自由德国青年联盟全国大会一事所刊登的造谣宣传的消息。
    你们每一个人都知道或者应该知道，美英的占领政策目的在使西德变为新战争的出击地。使西德重新军事化的工作正在加速进行中，虽然关于这件事并不曾公开说过一句话。日前，大西洋公约签字国参谋总长布莱德雷建议，“根据纯粹军事的动机”将西德拉进军事性质的大西洋公约。我现在引用一下德意志通讯社华盛顿的来讯，其中说：“无论如何，德国巨大的工业能力必将加强西方的防御”。
    同时，西方占领国家也已经重新准许西德的公司制造武器与毒气了。
    这些事实，你们都是知道得很清楚的。也许你们还不知道英国军官在建立新德国的军队方面所起的作用。
    几天以前，当莱因的英军司令凯特莱将军在柏林的时候，我曾跟他一道喝过鸡尾酒。我们谈话时，他坦白地说：“我又曾跟蒙蒂（蒙哥马利陆军元帅）谈过这一切事情，他完全同意我的意见，认为必须尽可能迅速地建立德国军队。某些蠢笨的政客们还在反对这件事，但现在不会长久了。”
    他的语气使人十分明白，他是常常在军官俱乐部和正式谈话中说起这件事的。他相信他如果在英国记者俱乐部里面谈这话，他是不乏同感者的。
    美国人在世界上、尤其在德国所执行的一贯的挑拨战争的政策，有时因为这种事实而掩蔽了它本来的面目，就是英国往往还想执行独立的政策，当然并不是因为英国的现政府是一个爱好和平的政府，而通常是为的要保护资本家的利益。
    大多数英国人民所采取的有历史性的、民主的和进步的立场使得政府没有机会来公开地发动战争。
    最近的舒曼计划便是一个特别明显的例子，这个计划不是别的，不过是一个调整西欧战争潜力之配置的计划罢了。
    英国政府和英国的钢铁大亨们都害怕美国资本所支持的这种采矿联营组织的竞争。
    因为英国顽固地关闭了一切与爱好和平的苏联及人民民主国家进行合作的机会，美国日益增大的压力也许会迫使英国政府参加进行，而将英国的利益置之不顾。
    美国的这种压力和美国的这种接触，可以用英国的占领政策来作详尽的说明。我只要说出我自己所知道的一个例子就够了：从七月一日开始，西德的外国记者们将受“与德国人同等”的待遇，就是说他们不能再要求没收的房屋、军用配给和便宜的汽油了。对于柏林的英国记者们却通过一项特别的决定，因为柏林英区司令长官鲍尔恩将军曾对我们说，我们被视为“占领军重要的成分”。根据此项决定，英国记者们将保留他们以前的特权，例如获得免费的香烟、酒精饮料等等的权利。美国人为着某种理由并不喜欢这项特别的决定，虽然它总共不过跟二十个人有关。我们听说，这项特别的决定已经“由于美国的反对”而被取消了。
    这还不过是这一方面的一个小小的无关重要的实例，证明了曾经是骄傲而独立的不列颠帝国，现在一举一动都听从美国人的吩咐了。
    你们或许会问，这一切跟我在这儿、在柏林的民主区域举行的记者招待会中，对你们说的决定有什么关系呢？顺便说一句，我作这样的决定时，并不是由于得到“俄国钱”，或者由于服下“神秘的亚洲迷魂药”而受到影响。
    我在开头的时候已经说过，我不打算再参加挑拨战争的宣传了，那种宣传不仅使苏联和人民民主国家受到威胁，而且还蓄意要把我的国家、我的英格兰变成美国的殖民地。
    皮特强调指出资本家报纸的记者们，没有作客观报道的机会。他继续说：经验使我越来越明白：忠实的报道，例如关于德意志民主共和国一切进步情况的忠实报道，决不会在那些报纸上登载出来的。
    我向伦敦报道的电讯报（英国特准在柏林发行的报纸）上的每一则狂想出来的消息，都在英国报纸上登出来了，而驳斥这些谰言的辟谣声明，实际上却永远不会见报的。
    在这儿，我要特别举一个实例。柏林英区司令长官鲍尔恩将军，在德国青年大会之前举行的一次记者招待会上发言时，一方面说起西方国家为反对凭空想出来的“共产党叛乱”而采取的疯狂的对策，另一方面也以忿恨的口吻指出“东德经济方面已有显著的成就”。这句话是从英国高级官员的嘴里说出来的，这是异常重要的自白，我就照样加以评述。第二天，英国每一家报纸上都以最显著地位登载鲍尔恩将军所说的关于武装威胁一节的谈话。但是他所发表的关于德意志民主共和国经济成就的谈话，都被略去不提了。
    还不曾把自己的肉体和灵魂出卖给战争贩子的，西方新闻界的我的可敬的同业们，你们中间的每一个人，大概都能够再搜集到几百则这一类的例证来。
    泰晤士报和每日电讯报的我的两位同业，在报告庆祝五一国际劳动节情况的电讯稿中，不小心地说了一句：东区人民警察在波茨坦麦广场上表现出很有纪律，西区暴徒投掷石子，而斯图姆（按为柏林西区警察局长——译注）警察竟不闻不问。
    第二天，他们俩都由英国高级当局加以申斥，说他们的报道“危及英国在柏林的地位”。
    每日电讯报的记者在降灵节的电讯中说：德国青年示威已留下很强烈的印象。也许是“偶然”的罢，不久以后，他就知道，他要被调回伦敦报馆去了。
    我想，关于德国青年大会，不必枉费时间再作更详细的报道了。在柏林的每一个记者都知道，西方报纸多么无耻地污蔑这次盛大的和平示威。电讯报上以及属于同一类的任何其他报纸上的每一则愚蠢的“本报记者通讯”，关于舒马赫要坦克车的每一次战争贩子的叫嚣，都在全世界报纸上登载出来。但是，例如我在三月间就已经报道说在德国民主区域将举行全体青年示威游行，说根本没有布置叛乱的意向，我当时就接到伦敦拍来的一封愤怒的电报，告诉我说：别的记者都发出了“关于叛乱阴谋计划的缜密的报道”，并且责问我为什么不作同样的报道。
    我是一个爱好和平的人，我不能再以武器供给战争贩子们了。十三年前，我为了争取和平与较好的世界，曾以一个普通的英国民主分子的资格，到西班牙去，在国际纵队的队伍中作战。后来民主势力在那战场上打败了，但是我们在为和平而斗争中必将赢得胜利，这种斗争现在正在如火如荼地进行中。
    每一个西方的记者，如果他是诚实的人，对于所谓西方的新闻自由，唯有苦笑而已。那儿仅有一种战争贩子的自由。我们供给他们所喜欢的一种虚妄的报道而得到报酬。
    但是，我们却没有为和平而斗争的自由，没有忠实报道实际情况的自由。正因为这个缘故，我今天已作了我的这种决定，不管我个人会因此而遭遇到怎样的后果。
    我确信，这样的日子终会来临的，那时所有一切记者们不再像今天这样充当战争贩子们的自来水笔，而变成正直及庄重得体的人了。
    约翰·皮特最后答复记者们所提出的问题。有人问他是不是共产党员，他在回答这个问题时特别说明他并不是共产党员。
    美联社记者问他是否还为路透社工作，皮特回答时说：直到此刻为止，他还是路透社驻柏林采访主任，他要发电报向伦敦路透社报告这次记者招待会的情形。
