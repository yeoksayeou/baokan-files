　　Visiting a Soviet Textile Factory Kindergarten
    ——One of My Soviet Diary Entries
    Zhao Guoyou
    At twelve o'clock on April 29th, our Chinese delegation took a car to visit a Soviet textile factory. The factory director introduced the factory's situation and then led us to visit the factory producing various kinds of silks. Finally, we visited the kindergarten of this factory.

    The person in charge of the kindergarten was a female comrade in her forties and very healthy. She moved the kindergarten chairs over for us to sit down. She said to the translator, "I will speak to you in Chinese." But she said the first sentence wrong, which made everyone laugh, and she laughed too. Later, we learned that she was just joking with us. Then she introduced the kindergarten's situation.

    The children in this kindergarten are all children of workers, aged from five to seven. Workers leave their children here when they go to work, and they take them home in the evening when they get off work. These children live a very happy life: three meals a day, two hours of sleep at midday; two classes a day, and the rest is playtime. The children's monthly expenses are only 3% to 10% of their parents' wages, and the rest is subsidized by the factory. After she gave a brief introduction of the kindergarten's situation, she led us inside for a tour. Upon entering, we saw many small lockers, each with a different small flower painted on the door. She pointed with two fingers and said, "This is where the children take off their coats and hats when they come in. The flowers on the doors are their markers." Further inside are the beds. At this time, the children were sleeping in their beds, all covered with bleached sheets. Each row of beds (one room has four rows of beds, accommodating two hundred children) is supervised by a comrade. After we entered the room, the children all opened their eyes to look, and some wanted to stand up. The female comrade said a few words to them, and the children lay down nicely. Old Wang of the delegation said to me, "They live such a collective life from a young age, cultivating organized and mass-oriented living habits." We entered another room, and the female comrade took out some drawings from a small box for us to see. She pointed to the Kremlin on the drawing and said, "These are all works of five-year-old children!" The box also contained various drawing tools, which are the children's supplies. They have a special class every week to teach the children to draw. There were many toys on the small tables and shelves for the children to play with. We entered another room, which was the second group's music room. Their play items and tables and chairs were also larger. In the third room, the walls were covered with posters, and there were handmade small trees, etc., on the ground, which were especially beautiful. The female comrade said excitedly: These are all decorated by the children themselves, in preparation for welcoming "May Day." In this room, we walked around several times and didn't want to leave. We entered another room. The things in this room were even more interesting: small round tables next to small chairs, all covered with white cloths, and small sofas all around. We all felt like it was a dining room in a small people's country. Finally, we passed through a room where the children were sleeping. The children greeted us warmly, which made us very moved.

　　参观苏联纺织工厂幼儿院
    ——访苏日记之一
    赵国有
    四月二十九日十二时，我们中国代表团坐着汽车，去参观苏联纺织工厂。该厂厂长介绍了一番工厂情况，便引着我们参观了纺织各种绸子的工厂；最后我们又参观了这个工厂的幼儿院。
    幼儿院的负责人是个四十多岁的女同志，身体很健康。她把幼儿院的椅子搬过来，让我们坐下。她对翻译说：“我用中国话给你们讲话。”但是她头一句话就说错了，引得大家都笑起来，她也笑了。后来，才知道她原来是给我们开玩笑。接着她便介绍了这个幼儿院的情况。
    这个幼儿院里的小孩都是工人的子女，年龄自五岁到七岁。工人们上工时把孩子放在这里，晚上工人下班时就把孩子带回家去。这些小孩子过着很幸福的生活：每天三顿饭，午间有两小时睡觉；每天还上两堂课，此外就是游玩。小孩每月费用只由他父母担负工资百分之三到百分之十，其余全是工厂补助的。她把幼儿院的情况作了一个简单的介绍以后，就领着我们进去参观。一进门看见许多小立柜，门上都画着不同的小花。她两只手指点着说：“这是小孩进屋脱大衣和帽子的地方，门上的花是他们的记号。”再往里走，就是睡床。这时候小孩正在床上睡觉，床上都铺着漂白的被单。每行床（一个房间有四行床，可容二百个孩子）有一个同志照管。我们进屋之后，小孩们都睁开眼睛看，有的要站起来看。女同志对他们说了几句话，小孩便很好的躺下来。代表团的老王对我说：“他们从小就过这样的集体生活，养成了有组织的群众性的生活习惯。”又走进一个房间，那位女同志从小箱子里拿出一些图画给我们看。她指着画上的克里姆林宫说：“这都是五岁小孩的作品！”箱子里还有各种画笔，这是小孩的用具。他们每星期专门有一课教小孩画。小桌子上和架子上摆着很多玩具，给小孩子玩耍。又进了一个屋，这是第二组学音乐的房子。他们玩耍的物品和桌椅也大一些。到第三个屋子里，满墙是画报，地上又有手工作成的小树等，特别好看。女同志很兴奋地说：这都是小孩们自己装饰的，准备迎接“五一”节。在这个屋子里，我们转了好几圈都不想离开。我们又进了一个屋。这屋子里的东西更有趣：小圆桌子旁边是小椅子，上面都铺着白布单子，四面有小沙发。我们都觉得真像小人国的食堂。最后又经过一个小孩子们睡觉的屋子。小孩子们热情地向我们招呼，真使我们十分感动。
