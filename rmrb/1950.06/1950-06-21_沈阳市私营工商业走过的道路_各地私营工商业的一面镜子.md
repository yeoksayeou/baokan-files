The Path Taken by Private Industry and Commerce in Shenyang:
A Mirror for Private Industry and Commerce in Various Regions
By Our Special Correspondent Tian Liu

Did state-owned enterprises squeeze out private enterprises?

After national price stabilization, the false purchasing power and morbid "prosperity" in major city markets disappeared, and industry and commerce encountered difficulties such as sluggish product sales and tight capital turnover. Some industrialists and businessmen mistakenly believed that their difficulties were the result of state-owned enterprises squeezing out private industry and commerce. In fact, this is not the case at all. Let's take a look at the Northeast. There, state-owned industry already accounts for more than 85% of all industry. This year, state-owned trading institutions will directly sell daily necessities to the people, accounting for 50% of the total social retail sales. Last year alone, state-owned industry there added 240,000 workers, and this year's production will increase by nearly double that of last year, with an additional 240,000 workers already added. In the Northeast, where the state-owned economy is developing so rapidly, what has happened to private industry and commerce?

Shenyang is the political and economic center of the Northeast region. By looking at the recovery, development, and changes of private industry and commerce in Shenyang, we can see the recovery, development, and changes of private industry and commerce in major and medium-sized cities in the Northeast, and we can also see the path that private industry and commerce across the country should take today in overcoming temporary difficulties.

Private Industry and Commerce Has Traveled a Winding Road

After liberation, private industry and commerce in Shenyang went through a winding road. In the early days of liberation, there was a period of recovery and development, followed by a period of stagnation and contraction after price stabilization. Then, with the recovery and development of state-owned industry and commerce, it received support, assistance, and guidance, and embarked on a path of normal development. The city's state-owned industry and commerce, in its substantial development, used entrusted processing, order placement, agency purchasing, agency sales, and raw material supply to private industry and commerce, enabling private industry and commerce to recover and develop along with it. Therefore, the private industry, which initially had only 6,546 businesses and more than 26,000 employees, had grown to 13,459 businesses and 56,328 employees by the end of April this year, an increase of more than double. The private commerce, which originally had only 11,034 households, had also increased to 16,584 households. As for the capital of private industry and commerce, it has increased from 133.93 billion (Northeast currency, same below) in April last year to 250.13 billion in April this year. In one year, it increased by more than 80%. Among them, the capital of private industry increased from 71.05 billion to 170.81 billion, an increase of 1.4 times; the capital of private commerce also increased from 62.88 billion to 79.32 billion, an increase of 26%.

A Period of Development in the Early Days of Liberation

Before the liberation of Shenyang, there was a popular folk song in the city: "Wei Lihuang is truly unkind, from the South Railway Station to the North Railway Station." This described the situation of traffic congestion and urban-rural separation at that time. After liberation, this situation underwent fundamental changes – the city, which had been bound for a long time, was suddenly liberated, and the urban and rural areas, which had been separated, were linked together, forming a rapid exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. As a result, private industry and commerce experienced rapid development. Within five months, industry suddenly increased from more than 6,000 households to more than 9,000 households, and commerce surged from more than 10,000 households to more than 20,000 households. Even industries such as gold and silver shops increased from 29 to 144, agency stores increased from 23 to 215, and the grain industry also increased fourfold.

Temporary "Slump" After Price Stabilization

In April last year, the Northeast People's Government took effective measures to stop the constant and drastic fluctuations in prices that had persisted for many years; subsequently, the "prosperity" in the market "slumped." The grain industry and speculative gold shops, which had blindly developed after liberation, collapsed one after another; those industries such as large hotels, luxury goods, and superstitious items, which had previously served the ruling class and speculators of the old society, had only been able to barely maintain themselves after liberation, and they also collapsed at this time. Industries such as grain and rice processing, leather, and clothing, which had developed during the war, lost their processing and sales targets with the victory of the People's Liberation War and the entry of the army into the customs. Industries such as knitting and rubber, which had developed under conditions of regional division and traffic obstruction, were squeezed out of the market by the high-quality and low-priced goods from Tianjin and Shanghai after the transportation was smooth, and thus stagnated, contracted, or collapsed. In total, from April last year, after price stabilization and the market's entry into normalcy, 1,670 industrial and commercial businesses in the city closed down or suspended operations.

Changing Business Policies, Recovering and Developing

It is an inevitable trend for these speculative, high-end consumer, and blindly developed industries to change with the development of social economy. However, the capital, equipment, and manpower of these industries are beneficial wealth for the country and the people. Therefore, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government initially actively led and helped them to turn to industries facing rural areas and facing production. Far-sighted industrialists and businessmen also accepted the guidance of the government and promptly changed their business policies. Over the past year, 544 industrial and commercial businesses (not including those who switched industries automatically after suspending operations without direct government assistance) that changed industries under the direct leadership of the government have implemented correct business policies and have all achieved good development. For example, the Dong Fuxing Weaving Factory was only a sales business before switching industries, with only 50 million in capital. After switching industries, with the assistance of the state-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's entrusted processing, it now has 1.65 billion in capital and can undertake the processing of 1,000 bolts of cloth per month. After deducting wages and other expenses, it can obtain a net profit of 100 million from processing fees.

State-Owned Enterprises Are Strong Supporters of Private Enterprises

For private industrial and commercial businesses that have encountered temporary difficulties in the period of social economic restructuring, receiving large orders, entrusted processing, and agency sales of products from state-owned enterprises is the most effective assistance. Last year, the government organized orders of more than 6 billion yuan from the city's iron industry, and paid more than 7 billion yuan in processing fees, which played a great role in helping the city's iron industry overcome difficulties. Various state-owned enterprises also directly entrusted private industries with processing and placed orders with private industries, the numbers of which far exceeded this number. For example, the Railway Bureau alone placed orders worth 9 billion yuan with the Dongmin Iron Factory, enabling the factory to quickly develop from a small factory with 20 people when it started work in May to a factory with 60 workers. Without the recovery and development of state-owned enterprises, this kind of processing and order placement would not have occurred. The development of the city's state-owned enterprises is causing processing and order placement to increase day by day. In the first quarter of this year, the processing fees paid by the state were equal to the total for the entire year last year, and the total value of orders placed exceeded 3.6 times that of last year. Negotiations are now underway to sign order contracts worth 3,000 tons of grain. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company recently signed a processing contract for 75,000 bolts of cloth with the textile industry. Private enterprises that meet the needs of the people have reached the peak of their existing production capacity under the continued large-scale entrusted processing and order placement of state-owned enterprises. In addition, state-owned stores sold products worth more than 400 billion yuan on behalf of private factories last year, and have already sold products worth more than 1 trillion yuan from January to April this year. In terms of raw materials, power, and capital, the People's Government has, over the past year, through planned adjustments and allocations, given private industry 15 tons of oils and fats, 25 tons of picric acid, 13,550 tons of metal raw materials, and 1,550 horsepower of power. The Northeast Bank has provided private enterprises with loans of more than 90 billion yuan. All of these measures have helped the recovery and development of private enterprises.

Labor-Management Consultation, Improving Production Enthusiasm

Another extremely important reason for the recovery and development of private enterprises in Shenyang is the signing of collective contracts and the organization of labor-management consultation meetings. The business of the Jianxing Iron Factory once shrank last year, reducing from 75 workers to only 25 workers. After the signing of the collective contract last winter, the enthusiasm of both labor and management quickly increased. As a result, from January to May this year, the monthly production plans were exceeded by 30% to 40%, enabling the factory to gradually recover and develop, and the number of workers has increased to 95. Recently, the factory organized a labor-management consultation meeting to discuss and approve a three-month production plan. Both labor and management have guaranteed to complete their tasks on time. On June 9, the factory held a commendation meeting for model workers, and the capitalist awarded 30 million yuan to 23 model producers, including Sun Rongyi. After the machinery and iron industry signed collective contracts last winter, in less than half a year, the capital increased by two and a half times, the number of employees increased by about three and a half times, the sales amount increased by six times, and the use of raw materials increased by eleven times compared with the same period last year. Now, collective contracts have been signed in all 25 major industries in Shenyang.

Continuous Growth of Farmers' Purchasing Power After Land Reform

Both Public and Private Industry and Commerce Have Broad Prospects for Development

Private industry and commerce in Shenyang is now developing normally; industry and commerce in other large and medium-sized cities in the Northeast are also recovering and developing. What is the fundamental reason for this normal development? One of the most important reasons is that the entire Northeast region has completed land reform, and the productivity and purchasing power of the broad masses of the people, especially the peasants, have been greatly improved, the supply of food and industrial raw materials has greatly increased, and the demand for industrial products has also greatly increased. In 1947, the entire Northeast sold 800,000 bolts of cloth, in 1948 it sold 1.2 million bolts, and in 1949, the first year after the completion of land reform, it sold 3.2 million bolts, an increase of more than 1.6 times compared with 1948, and an increase of three times compared with 1947. This year, the second year after the completion of land reform, it was originally expected to sell 9 million bolts of cloth, but 2.5 million bolts have already been sold in the first quarter. At the same time, not only has the quantity of demand greatly increased, but the types, specifications, and other requirements have also become more complex and improved. In 1947, it was enough to have blue and white cloth; farmers even only wanted white cloth, and after buying white cloth, they would casually dye it some color with stove ash, leaves, and other things. Now, the demand for beautiful floral cloth is gradually increasing.

After land reform, the purchasing power of farmers has increased. To what extent has it increased? Let's look at the facts in Songjiang Province: After last autumn, the National Grain Company initially planned to purchase only 80,000 tons because the amount of grain that farmers could sell was insufficient. Moreover, cadres from the province to the county were not confident, thinking that the number was too large. The fact is that this number was quickly purchased, and the farmers' grain continued to be delivered, and it was purchased all the way to 320,000 tons, more than three times the original plan. This spring, at the people's representative meetings in various counties, peasant representatives also criticized the state for purchasing grain, saying that the government was not actively purchasing farmers' grain, so that they wanted to buy things, because the grain could not be sold, could not be bought in full. They also criticized the state-owned stores for having too few goods and incomplete varieties, and the things they wanted to buy were either bought by others first or were simply not available. Later, the Songjiang Provincial People's Government conducted an investigation into this matter. The result was: farmers still have 60,000 to 70,000 tons of grain in their hands that they are eager to sell; and state-owned stores and cooperatives either do not have or have very few of the more than 30 kinds of items needed by farmers in extremely large quantities.

The above situation is not only the case in Songjiang Province, but throughout the Northeast region. State-owned stores originally planned to purchase 900,000 tons of grain, but they purchased 1.7 million tons, and farmers still have more than one million tons of surplus grain in their hands that they are eager to sell. If the farmers' sideline income is included, according to the Northeast People's Government's Trade Department, the farmers' purchasing power this year can reach more than 5 million tons of grain, and next year it can rise to more than 8 million tons. One-quarter of the 40 million people in the Northeast are urban residents, of which workers account for 1.3 million. The purchasing power of one worker is equal to 25 farmers, which means that the purchasing power can reach the same level as 30 million rural residents. Facing such a huge social purchasing power, the prospects for public and private industry that supply daily necessities to the broad masses of the people and public and private commerce that connects producers and consumers are very broad and bright.

　　沈阳市私营工商业走过的道路
    各地私营工商业的一面镜子
    本报特派记者  田流
    国营企业排挤了私营企业吗？
    全国物价稳定后，各大城市市场上虚假的购买力和病态的“繁荣”一同消失了，工商业遇到了产品滞销和资金周转不灵的困难。部分的工商业家错认为他们的困难是国营企业排挤私营工商业的结果。事实上完全不是这样的。我们且看一看东北吧，在那里，国营工业已占全部工业百分之八十五以上，今年国营贸易机构要直接卖给人民日用品将占社会零售总额百分之五十；那里的国营工业，去年一年之内就增加了二十四万工人，今年的生产量还要比去年提高近一倍，现已增加了工人二十四万。国营经济如此迅速发展着的东北区，私营工商业怎样了呢？
    沈阳市是东北区的政治经济中心。我们看了沈阳市私营工商业的恢复、发展和变化，就可以看出东北各大、中城市私营工商业的恢复、发展和变化，也就可以看出今天全国私营工商业在克服暂时困难时所应走的道路。
    私营工商业经过了曲折的道路
    解放后的沈阳市，私营工商业经过了曲折的道路。初解放时曾有一度恢复和发展，物价稳定后又一度停滞和萎缩，然后又在国营工商业恢复和发展的同时得到支持、扶植和引导，走上了正常发展的道路。该市国营工商业在长足发展中，对私营工商业的委托加工、定货、代购、代销以及供应原料，使私营工商业伴随着恢复和发展起来了。因此，初解放时只有六千五百四十六家、职工二万六千余人的私营工业，到今年四月底止已经发展到一万三千四百五十九家、职工五万六千三百二十八人，增加了一倍以上；原来只有一万一千零三十四户的私营商业，也已增加到一万六千五百八十四户。至于私营工商业的资金，则已从去年四月的一万三千三百九十三亿（东北币，下同）增加到今年四月的二万五千零十三亿。一年之中，增加了百分之八十以上。其中私营工业资金由七千一百零五亿增到一万七千零八十一亿元，增加了一·四倍；私营商业资金也由六千二百八十八亿元增加到七千九百三十二亿元，增加了百分之二十六。
    初解放时一度发展
    沈阳解放前，市内流传着一首歌谣：“卫立煌，真不善，火车南站到北站。”这是形容当时交通阻塞、城乡隔绝的局面的。解放后这种情况有了根本变化——长期被束缚着的城市一下子解放了，被隔绝着的城乡联结在一起了，一时形成城乡物资的急速交流，因而私营工商业就有了飞跃的发展，五个月内工业由六千多户突增到九千多户，商业由一万多户骤增到两万多户。甚至连金店银楼那样的行业也由二十九家增到了一百四十四家，代理店由二十三家增到了二百一十五家，粮业也增加了四倍。
    物价稳定后暂时“萧条”
    去年四月间，东北人民政府采取有效措施停止了多年来不断剧烈波动的物价；接着，市场上的“繁荣”便“萧条”下来了。解放后盲目发展起来的粮业和投机性的金店业等，一个跟着一个垮下来了；那些过去专为旧社会统治阶级和投机商人们服务的大饭店、奢侈品、迷信品等行业，解放后就已是仅能勉强维持的，这时也就垮了下去。战时发展起来的粮米加工、皮革、被服等行业，随着人民解放战争的胜利、大军的入关，失掉了加工和销售的对象；在地区分割、交通阻塞情况下发展起来的针织、橡胶等行业，交通运输畅通后，又被津沪等地的物美价廉的好货色挤出了市场，因而也就停滞、萎缩或垮台了。总计从去年四月物价稳定、市场纳入正规后，全市工商业曾倒闭和歇业了一千六百七十家。
    改变业务方针，恢复发展
    这些投机性的、高级消费性的和盲目发展起来的行业，随着社会经济的变化发展而改变，是必然的趋向。但这些行业的资金、设备和人力，却是对国家、对人民有益的财富。因此，沈阳市人民政府一开始就积极地领导和帮助他们转向面对农村、面对生产的行业。有远见的工商业家也接受了政府的指导，及时地转变了业务方针。一年来，经政府直接领导转业的五百四十四户（不经政府直接帮助，歇业后自动转业的未计在内）工商业执行了正确的经营方针，都得到了很好的发展。如东复兴织布工厂，未转业前是贩卖业，仅有资金五千万元；转业后，在国营花纱布公司委托加工的扶助下，现已有资金十六亿五千万元，每月能承作加工布一千匹，得到加工费除工资及其他开支外，能得纯利一亿元。
    国营企业是私营企业有力的援助者
    在社会经济改组期中遭到暂时困难的私营工商业，得到国营企业的大量定货、委托加工和代销产品，对他们是最有效的援助。去年政府有组织地向该市铁工业定货达六十余亿元，支付加工费七十余亿元，对该市铁工业度过困难起了很大的作用。各国营企业又直接委托私营工业加工、向私营工业定货，其数目更远远超过此数。如铁路局仅向东民铁工厂一家的定货就达九十亿元，使该厂由五月开工时二十个人的小工厂，很快就发展成为六十个工人的工厂。如果没有国营企业的恢复和发展，这种加工和定货是不会出现的。该市国营企业的发展，使加工和定货正在一天天增加。今年第一季度国家付出的加工费等于去年全年的总和，定货总值更超过了去年三·六倍，现在又在进行着签订价合三千吨粮食的定货合同的谈判。花纱布公司最近又和纺织业签订了七万五千匹布的加工合同。合乎人民需要的私营企业，在国营企业继续大量委托加工、定货的情况下，已达到现有生产能力的顶点了。此外，国营商店在去年为私营工厂代销了价值四千余亿元的产品，今年一至四月则已经代销了价值一万余亿元的产品。在原料、动力和资金方面，人民政府一年来又经过有计划的调剂、分配给私营工业十五吨油脂，二十五吨苦味酸，一万三千五百五十吨五金原料和一千五百五十匹马力的动力。东北银行给私营企业贷款九百余亿元。以上这些措施，都帮助了私营企业的恢复和发展。
    劳资协商，提高生产积极性
    沈阳市私营企业的恢复和发展的另一个极重要的原因，则是订立集体合同，组织劳资协商会议。建兴铁工厂的营业，去年曾一度萎缩，由七十五名工人缩减到只剩二十五名工人。经过去冬订立集体合同后，劳资双方的积极性随即迅速提高。因之，今年一月至五月，每月的生产计划都超过了百分之三十至四十地完成，使该厂逐渐地恢复和发展起来，工人已增到了九十五人。最近该厂又组织了劳资协商会议，协商通过了三个月的生产计划。劳资双方都保证按期完成自己的任务。六月九日，该厂举行奖励模范大会，资方以三千万元奖给了孙荣义等二十三名模范生产者。机械铁工业去冬签订集体合同后，不到半年的时间，资金增加了两倍半，职工增加了约三倍半，卖钱额增加了六倍，使用原料比去年同期增加了十一倍。现在，沈阳市二十五个主要行业，已都签订了集体合同。
    土地改革后农民购买力不断增长
    公私营工商业都有广阔的发展前途
    沈阳市私营工商业现在是在正常发展中；东北其他的大、中城市工商业也在恢复和发展着。这种正常发展的根本原因是什么呢？最重要的原因之一是东北全区已经完成了土地改革，广大人民、特别是农民的生产力和购买力已经大大提高，食粮和工业原料的供给大大增加了，对工业品的需要也就大为增加了。全东北在一九四七年销布八十万匹，一九四八年一百二十万匹，在土地改革全部完成后的第一年——一九四九年，就销了三百二十万匹，比一九四八年增加了一·六倍多，比一九四七年增加了三倍。今年，土地改革完成后的第二年，原来预计销布九百万匹，但第一季就已实销了二百五十万匹。同时，不仅数量的需要大大地增加了，而且种类、规格等要求也复杂和提高了。一九四七年只要有蓝、白二色布就足够了；农民甚至只要白布，买回白布后随便用灶膛灰、树叶等胡乱染上个什么颜色就算了。现在，要漂亮的花布的渐渐增多了。
    土地改革后，农民的购买力是提高了。究竟高到了什么程度呢？看松江省的事实吧：去年秋后，最初国家粮食公司因对于农民能出卖的粮食数量不足，只计划收购八万吨。而且从省到县的干部都没有信心，以为数字太大。事实是很快就购足了这个数目，而农民的粮食仍源源送来，一直收购到了三十二万吨，较原计划超过了三倍。到今春各县开人民代表会议时，农民代表们还对国家购粮提出了批评，说政府不积极收购农民的粮食，以致使他们想买的东西，因为粮食卖不出，不能如数买进来。还批评国营商店的货物太少，货色不全，想买的东西不是让别人先买完了就是根本没有。后来，松江省人民政府为此事进行了一次调查。结果是：农民手里到如今还存有急于出售的粮食六、七万吨；而农民需要的三十多种数量极大的物品，国营商店和合作社不是没有就是数量很少。
    上述的情况，不仅是松江省如此，全东北区都是如此。国营商店原计划收购九十万吨粮食，结果收购到一百七十万吨，而农民手里还积压着百万吨以上的多余粮食急于出售。如果把农民的副业收入计算在内，据东北人民政府贸易部估计，今年农民的购买力能达到五百余万吨粮食，明年则能升至八百万吨以上。东北四千万人口中有四分之一是城市人口，其中工人占一百三十万人。一个工人的购买力等于二十五个农民，就是说购买力可以达到和三千万农村人口相等的程度。面对着如此庞大的社会购买力，供给广大人民日用品的公私营工业和沟通生产者与消费者的公私营商业的前途都是非常远大光明的。
