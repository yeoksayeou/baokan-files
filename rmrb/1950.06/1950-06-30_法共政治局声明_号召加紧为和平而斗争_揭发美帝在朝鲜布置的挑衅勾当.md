　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 29th: TASS, Paris, June 29th: "L'Humanité" published a statement from the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party regarding the Korean situation. The statement said: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, before the eyes of all peace defenders, exposes the provocative schemes orchestrated in Korea by the warmongers serving American imperialism.

　　The puppet Syngman Rhee, having failed in the elections of May 30, 1950, resorted to provocation and launched a war in order to continue playing the role he is playing in South Korea. His lackey government, as admitted by government newspapers, is solely engaged in deception, speculation, and all sorts of trickery. This government has received instructions from Dulles in the past few days. The facts have shown what these instructions are about.

　　The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party emphasized: The American imperialists, obstructing the reunification of Korea desired by the entire Korean people and supporting the puppet Syngman Rhee government, want to maintain a hotbed of unrest in the Far East, just as they are dividing Germany for strategic interests and using the Bonn ruling clique to obstruct the normalization of the European situation.

　　The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party stated: The Korean provocation occurred just after General MacArthur took measures against the Japanese Communists, and is an integral part of a conspiracy planned by the same master, with the aim of using military provocations to oppose the people's will to fight for national independence.

　　The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party is convinced that the French people, who feel deeply connected to the Korean people, will shatter the evil conspiracies of the war instigators and will win victory in the struggle against foreign agents and for the defense of national unity.

　　The statement of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party finally called for intensified struggle for peace.

    号召加紧为和平而斗争
    揭发美帝在朝鲜布置的挑衅勾当
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十九日电：《人道报》刊载法国共产党中央委员会政治局发表的关于朝鲜事件的声明。声明中说：法国共产党政治局要在一切和平保卫者们的万目睽睽之下，揭发那些为美帝国主义服务的战争贩子们在朝鲜所布置的挑衅勾当。
    傀儡李承晚，在一九五○年五月三十日的选举中既已失败，就进行挑衅并发动战争，以便继续扮演他正在南朝鲜扮演的脚色。他的奴才政府，正如政府报纸所承认，一味从事欺骗、投机、诡谲百出。这个政府过去几天来奉到了杜勒斯的指令。事实已表明了这些指令是关于什么事情的。
    法共政治局强调说：美国帝国主义者们，阻挠朝鲜全国人民所力求的朝鲜的统一，而支持傀儡李承晚政府，想由此保持住远东动乱的温床，正像他们为了战略的利益使德国分裂，并利用波恩统治集团，以阻挠欧洲局势正常化的政策一样。
    法共政治局声明：朝鲜的挑衅事件是刚在麦克阿瑟将军对日本共产党人采取措施之后发生的，乃是同一个主子的阴谋计划中的一个组成部分，其目的在于用军事的挑衅来反对人民争取民族独立的意志。
    法共政治局确信不疑，法国人民对他们表示休戚相关的朝鲜人民，一定会打破战争煽动者们的罪恶阴谋诡计，在反对外国代理人、保卫国家统一的斗争中必将赢得胜利。
    法共政治局的声明最后号召加紧为和平而斗争。
