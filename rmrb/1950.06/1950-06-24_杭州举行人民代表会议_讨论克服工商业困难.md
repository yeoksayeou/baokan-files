Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Dispatch: The Fourth Hangzhou Municipal People's Representative Conference, lasting five days, concluded on the 26th of last month. Two hundred and seventy-five representatives from all sectors attended. The conference focused on discussing how to correctly understand the nature of the current difficulties encountered by industry and commerce in Hangzhou and how to overcome them. The conference unanimously agreed that the current national prices have stabilized, providing favorable conditions for the recovery and development of legitimate industry and commerce. Private industrialists and merchants should quickly change the serious shortcomings of blind production, bloated organizations, backward technology, and poor management in the past. Representatives from all walks of life fully promoted the spirit of criticism and self-criticism during the discussion and put forward many positive opinions on overcoming difficulties. Worker representatives stated that they would continue to actively unite with capitalists, establish new labor-capital relations, strengthen labor discipline, and jointly improve production. Representatives from the business community criticized and persuaded a few representatives who only relied on government assistance in overcoming difficulties and attempted to delay the arrears of public bonds and taxes, unanimously expressing their determination to change the direction of production and management methods to adapt to the new situation. Government representatives, in addition to providing a detailed explanation of the policy of considering both public and private interests, also made a profound review of some deviations that occurred in the specific implementation of the policy.

The conference unanimously passed resolutions on transforming production to overcome temporary difficulties, on completing the 1950 tax revenue task, and on providing relief to unemployed workers, and re-elected the Hangzhou Municipal Consultative Committee. Before the closing of the conference, Tan Zhenlin, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government, attended and delivered a speech. He gave a detailed explanation of the causes of the current difficulties in Hangzhou's industry and commerce, the achievements and shortcomings of the government's tax work, and the relationship between public and private sectors.
