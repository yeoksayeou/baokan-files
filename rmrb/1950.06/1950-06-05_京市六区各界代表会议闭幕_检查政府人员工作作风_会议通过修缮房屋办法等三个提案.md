　　Beijing News Agency: The People's Representative Conference of the Sixth District of Beijing victoriously closed on the afternoon of June 3rd. The morning session was devoted to criticism and self-criticism regarding the work styles of personnel from various government departments. This conference received a total of 121 proposals from representatives from all walks of life criticizing the work style of cadres, targeting personnel from the District Office, the Public Security Sub-bureau, and the Tax Sub-bureau. Based on the review results and handling suggestions of the proposal review committee regarding these proposals, Gao Yunchao, the head of the Sixth District, Wang Zhenzhong, the head of the First Foreign Affairs Division of the Public Security Bureau, Xin Liang, the head of the Second Foreign Affairs Division, and Li Ren, the head of the Sixth Tax Division, respectively delivered reports at the meeting and conducted self-criticism. They believed that the continuous occurrence of improper work styles by individual cadres within their respective departments was due to their own bureaucratic tendencies. They had failed to adequately educate cadres, promptly correct shortcomings, and delve into the masses to listen to their opinions and reports. Five criticized public security personnel from the Second Foreign Affairs Division made public self-examinations, unanimously requesting the representatives to continue to offer criticism to help them further correct shortcomings and improve their work. The government personnel openly and sincerely accepting criticism and honestly conducting self-criticism and self-examination at the People's Representative Conference was unprecedented, greatly moving the representatives. The representatives immediately responded with thunderous applause, warmly welcoming the self-examination. Li Ren, the head of the Fourth Tax Division, reported to the representatives on the 18 proposals criticizing the work style of tax bureau cadres, and represented the Tax Division in expressing full acceptance of these reports. He said: Everyone should not have any reservations, I will definitely be responsible for keeping the secrets of the informants. Li Rui, the chairman of the presidium, pointed out: Inspecting and correcting the work style of cadres is a regular task and requires long-term continuous effort. What we have done today is only opening the door to criticism and self-criticism. We hope that all representatives will continue to submit opinions to the consultation committee, the district office, or relevant departments at any time after the meeting, and truly play a role in managing and supervising the work of the government.
    In the afternoon, the meeting continued to listen to and adopt the report of the Proposal Review Committee on the review opinions of the proposals of the Civil Affairs and Public Security groups, and unanimously agreed to send the proposals related to industry, commerce, and taxation to the relevant departments of the Municipal Government for reference, because these issues cannot be solved by the District Office alone. Then, after Li Rui delivered a closing speech on behalf of the presidium, the conference successfully concluded.
    Beijing News Agency: The People's Representative Conference of the Sixth District of Beijing, on the day before the closing (June 2nd), discussed the work report of the District Office and discussed and approved the three proposals put forward by the preparatory committee on measures for repairing houses, repairing dirt roads, and launching a summer and autumn public health campaign. Representatives from all walks of life spoke one after another, unanimously expressing that they would properly convey and assist the government in doing these things well.

　　京市六区各界代表会议闭幕
    检查政府人员工作作风 
    会议通过修缮房屋办法等三个提案
    【本报讯】京市新闻处消息：京市第六区各界人民代表会议于六月三日下午胜利闭幕。上午的大会展开了对于政府各部门工作人员作风的批评与自我批评。这次会议共收到各界代表批评干部作风的提案一百二十一件，批评对象包括区公所、公安分局和税务分局的工作人员。根据提案审查委员会对于这些提案的审查结果和处理意见，第六区高云超区长、公安局外一分局王振中局长和外二分局辛良局长、税务第六分局李仁局长在会议中分别作了报告，并进行了自我批评，认为他们负责的部门内不断发生个别干部作风不正的现象，是由于自己犯了官僚主义的毛病，没有好好教育干部及时纠正缺点，没有深入群众，听取群众的意见和检举。外二分局有五个被批评的公安人员当众作了检讨，一致要求代表们继续提出批评，帮助他们进一步纠正缺点、改进工作。政府工作人员公开在各界代表会议上诚恳接受批评，并老老实实地进行自我批评和检讨，这是破天荒的事情，使代表们受到极大的感动，代表们立刻掌声如雷，极热烈地欢迎这个检讨。税务第四分局李仁局长在会上报告代表们批评税局干部作风的十八件提案，并代表税务分局表示完全接受这些检举。他说：大家不要有什么顾忌，我一定负责代告发者保守秘密。主席团主席李锐指出：检查和端正干部作风，是一个经常工作，须长期不断努力。今天我们所作的还只是打开了批评和自我批评的大门，希望各位代表会后继续向协商委员会、区公所或有关部门随时提出意见，真正起到管理监督政府工作的作用。
    下午，会议继续听取并通过了提案审查委员会关于民政、治安两组的提案审查意见的报告，并一致同意将有关工商、税收的提案送请市政府各有关机关参考，因为这方面的问题，不是区公所所能单独解决的。接着，李锐代表主席团致闭幕词后，大会即告胜利结束。
    【又讯】京市新闻处消息：京市六区各界代表会议，在闭幕前一日（六月二日），曾讨论了区公所的工作报告并讨论通过了筹委会提出的关于修缮房屋办法，整修土路，开展夏秋公共卫生运动等三个提案。各界代表先后发言，一致表示要好好传达，协助政府把这些事情办好。
