Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th. The China Native Produce Company has recently begun to vigorously regulate native products from all over the country. Since the company convened a national native products conference in April and determined the business policy of "domestic regulation as the main focus," the total value of various native products directly transferred in and out of the North China region by the company in just the second half of May reached approximately 8 billion yuan. Among them, the native products transferred to Beijing and Tianjin from various regions include: Zhejiang's cool mats, alum, and rosin; Xuchang's tobacco leaves; the Southwest region's gallnuts; Shandong's flax; Northeast China's lard; Southern Anhui's tea; and the Northwest region's angelica and rhubarb. The native products shipped out of the North China region include rhubarb and anemarrhena for the Central and Southern China regions. The company's vigorous regulation of native products not only solves many sales difficulties for the masses in various regions but also strengthens the exchange of materials between various regions in the country. For example, cool mats are produced in large quantities in Zhejiang Province, but sales are difficult, while shipping them to the Beijing-Tianjin area is perfect for meeting seasonal demand and ensures brisk sales.

　　中国土产公司开始调剂国内土产
    【新华社天津十日电】中国土产公司最近已开始大力调剂全国各地土产。该公司自四月间召开全国土产会议，确定以“国内调剂为主”的业务方针后，仅五月下半月经该公司直接由华北区调出调进的各项土产，总值约达八十亿元。其中由各地区调到京、津两地的土产计有：浙江的凉席、明矾及松香，许昌的烟叶，西南区的五倍子，山东的线麻，东北区的猪油；皖南的茶叶，西北区的当归、大黄等。由华北区运出的土产有运给中南区的大黄、毛知母等。该公司大力调剂土产，不但为各地群众解决了不少推销上的困难，而且加强了国内各地区间的物资交流。例如凉席在浙江省生产很多，但推销困难，运到京、津一带则正好适应季节而畅销。
