Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 14th: The "Letter to the Entire People" issued on June 7th by the Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland has been warmly supported by the Korean people.

Factories, mines, and schools in North Korea are holding mobilization rallies one after another. At all mobilization rallies, the masses present unanimously expressed their determination to fight to the end to realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. Since the 9th, major newspapers in North Korea have successively published editorials on the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Workers' Party's organ, *Rodong Sinmun*, wrote in an editorial entitled "Arise! Greet the Fifth Anniversary of the 'August 15th' Liberation by Realizing the Unification of the Fatherland": "The Fatherland Front has twice issued calls for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, the purpose of which is to avoid internecine warfare and strive for the unification of the fatherland through peaceful means. Therefore, it has been supported by all Korean patriots, but it has been repeatedly sabotaged by the anti-popular Syngman Rhee clique and their master, American imperialism." The editorial continued: "The Korean people cannot bear to see the fatherland continue to be divided, but must resolutely use their own strength to solve the fate of the fatherland." The editorial emphasized: "There are only two paths before the entire Korean people: to be loyal to the fatherland or to betray the fatherland. There is no third path." The editorial called on political parties and organizations in South Korea that have not yet joined the Fatherland Front, as well as those who have been persecuted and deceived by the reactionary government and have remained silent or temporarily taken the wrong path, to turn back as soon as possible and rise up to respond to the call of the Fatherland Front.

However, in South Korea, according to a report by the Korean Central News Agency on the 12th, the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique was extremely shocked after the Fatherland Unification Front issued the "Letter to the Entire People." The Seoul puppet government issued an order on the 8th to universally implement "special alert" in various parts of South Korea, and closely monitor the actions of South Korean political parties, social organizations, and democratic figures from all walks of life, in an attempt to obstruct the convening of the North-South representative consultative conference. The pseudo-Army Chief of Staff, Chae Byong-duk, openly declared: "The peaceful unification advocated by the Fatherland Unification Democratic Front is absolutely not allowed."

　　朝鲜人民拥护和平统一号召
    北部工厂学校集会宣誓将坚决斗争
    美帝走狗李承晚卖国集团极为震惊
    【新华社平壤十四日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线六月七日为促进祖国和平统一而发表的告全国人民书，获得朝鲜人民的热烈拥护。
    北朝鲜各工厂、矿山、学校，正纷纷召开动员大会。在所有动员会上，到会的群众都一致表示要为实现祖国的和平统一而坚决斗争到底。九日以来，北朝鲜各重要报纸均相继发表了有关朝鲜和平统一的社论。劳动党机关报《劳动新闻》在题为《起来！以实现祖国的统一来迎接“八、一五”解放五周年》的社论中写道：“祖国战线曾两度发表了和平统一祖国的号召，其目的在于避免同族相争的内战，争取以和平方法求得祖国的统一。因此，它得到朝鲜一切爱国者的拥护，但却遭到反人民的李承晚党徒及其主子美帝国主义的一再破坏。”社论继指出：“朝鲜人民不能目睹祖国继续分裂下去，而要坚决以人民自己的力量，来解决祖国的命运。”社论强调指出：“摆在全朝鲜人民当前的道路只有两条：为祖国尽忠或是背叛祖国。除此再没有第三条道路。”社论号召南朝鲜至今尚未参加祖国战线的政党团体与遭到反动政府迫害和欺瞒而保持沉默或一时走错路的人士，及早回头，奋起响应祖国战线的号召。
    但在南朝鲜，据朝鲜中央通讯社十二日报道，祖国统一战线告全国人民书发表以后，李承晚卖国集团极为震惊。汉城傀儡政府已于八日下令在南朝鲜各地普遍施行“特别警戒”，并严密监视南朝鲜各政党社会团体及各界民主人士的行动，力图阻碍南、北代表协商会议的召开。伪陆军参谋总长蔡秉德公然声称：“祖国统一民主主义战线所提倡的和平统一是绝不能允许的”。
