　　Introducing Soviet Factory Newspaper Workers
　　Li He
　　Among Soviet newspapers, the factory small newspapers are widely circulated and have a great influence. This is a new type of newspaper that emerged during the years of socialist construction. Factory small newspapers, like those of universities, state organs, and cultural institutions, are based on dozens or hundreds of wall newspapers. In Moscow alone, there are now more than 120 kinds of small newspapers. Moscow's machine-building workers, metallurgical workers, electrical workers, railway workers, textile workers, food workers... almost all industrial workers have their own printed newspapers. There are newspapers that are the oldest, published for twenty or twenty-five years, and there are also newspapers that have only recently been published. They each have distinct characteristics that clearly express their production nature, and they also have a common task, which is primarily to promote and popularize the experiences of advanced producers, the initiatives of production innovators, and the achievements of outstanding Stakhanovites, science, technology, and art workers. More than 30 years ago, Lenin instructed that the Soviet newspaper has the mission to "put concrete and practical labor issues in" the primary position. Lenin's instructions became the direction of the factory small newspaper activities. The joint saving method advocated by Kollabernikova, a female worker at the "Paris Commune" shoe factory, who is well known throughout the Soviet Union, and the initiative to use saved materials to produce one day per month, was echoed by the shoe factory newspaper "Commune Member." The initiative of tram female driver Donnikova to implement socialist responsible protection system for trams and other public transportation, was supported by the "Moscow Tram Newspaper." Such facts, which were first introduced and supported by the factory small newspaper, and then promoted and popular throughout the country, illustrates the role of the factory small newspaper.
　　The following is an example of a Moscow factory small newspaper - the Kaganovich State Bearing Factory's "Stalin's Call Newspaper."
　　Two rooms, the windows facing the factory yard - this is the ordinary editorial office.
　　The telephone rings, an editor of the editorial office picked up the phone, according to the habit of reporters, took out a small notebook, and whispered: "Hello! This is the 'Stalin's Call Newspaper' editorial office. Is that the workshop director? What's new? Completed a month's plan ahead of schedule! Great. ... No, I'll ask about the details myself. Such materials cannot be interviewed on the phone." He ran out with the notebook.
　　One visitor after another walked into the editorial office. A workshop union leader brought the results of the Stakhanovite shift in the press shop. Two factory sports association athletes came to complain that the sports association did not guarantee the clothing for participation in the May Day parade. An ironworker sent in a poem he wrote to defend peace.
　　The themes of the factory newspaper are broad. However, everything he publishes is subject to the sole purpose: to fight for the completion of the production plan. This purpose inspires all the editorial staff and worker correspondents.
　　Many people participate in newspaper work: there are nearly two hundred regular worker correspondents. The power of "Stalin's Call Newspaper" lies in the fact that it is a collective propagandist, agitator and organizer.
　　The merit of the "Stalin's Call Newspaper" journalists lies in their ability to select the most typical, the most prominent, the phenomena and facts that promote factory progress, accelerate factory speed, and improve labor productivity from the collective life of thousands of people in the factory, from the many phenomena and facts. The newspaper lovingly supports every new initiative, explains and promotes the founder's experience, and showcases the deep roots of patriotism of these initiatives.
　　If you flip through the bound volume of the "Stalin's Call Newspaper", you can see how the "implementation team movement" initiated by Alexander Bulov grew and expanded. There was a time when the factory had such a rule that the repairman only cared about satisfying his class of workers. Only when he saw that the lathe was not maintained until the next shift, he started to repair it. Bulov proposed a new organization method of repairmen's labor. Now all lathes are handed over to the next shift in operation and in complete good condition, and with this situation, the principle of remuneration for repairmen's labor has also changed: their wages are not calculated by shift, but by the productivity of the repair team taking care of all lathes. The newspaper widely promoted Bulov's valuable new suggestion and urged its implementation in production practice. We soon learned that the wages of the first implementation team repairmen in the factory increased by 150 percent, and the wages of the workers managing the lathes also increased appropriately. The labor productivity of the lathes that are often repaired well increased by 40 percent, and the unqualified products were reduced by half. The "Stalin's Call Newspaper" reflected the progress of all workers in the past year and the first months of this year, their creative explorations and production achievements. We saw that, following the implementation team, the entire implementation department was also established. The movement initiated by Bulov extended to non-production workshops. The Stakhanovite creative ideas produced new initiatives: workers implemented the socialist protection system for valuable measuring instruments. Then, according to the initiative of technicians Ivanov and Barasov, the socialist cooperation movement between engineers, technicians and workers began.
　　More than 40 wall newspapers and many cartoon wall newspapers have regular staff members who are active members of the worker correspondents. The "Stalin's Call Newspaper" almost every issue reports to readers which new cartoon wall newspapers have been published. These cartoons use the sharp pens of worker painters and correspondents to fight against the shortcomings in production and life.
　　The critical articles, communications and sketches of the "Stalin's Call Newspaper" are aimed very accurately. Recently, according to the newspaper's materials, a repair shop director and a group leader of the wheel axle shop were dismissed because of their poor leadership style. The editorial office published an article describing the irresponsible treatment of a new construction (a suggestion on saving non-ferrous metals), called "The Miserable Life of an Important New Construction", and the management issued an order to handle this matter.
　　This is how the fighting Bolshevik journalists of one of Moscow's largest factories are working, this is skilled, purposeful, passionate, and truly professional work. Here is the only factory news research room in Moscow, where many wall newspaper editors and staff members often gather to exchange experiences. Many articles and communications of "Stalin's Call Newspaper" are written interestingly and vividly. Not long ago, the editorial office asked readers a question: "If you were to speak at the International Conference for the Support of Peace, what would you say?" The answers of many Stakhanovites, engineers, scientists, doctors, and housewives are filled with love for the socialist country and Comrade Stalin, demanding world peace and hating war instigators.

　　介绍苏联的工厂报纸工作者
    李何
    苏联报纸中销路很广，影响很大的是工厂的小型报纸。这是社会主义建设年份中才出现的新型报纸。工厂小报和大学校、国家机关、文化机关的小报一样，是以几十几百个壁报为基础的。仅在莫斯科，现在就有小报一百二十多种。莫斯科的机器制造工人、冶金工人、电气工人、铁路工人、纺织工人、食品工人……差不多所有产业工人都有自己的印刷的报纸。有最老的、出版二十年或二十五年的报纸，也有新近才出版的报纸。它们各有明确表现自己生产性质的特点，也有共同的任务，就是首先宣传和推广生产先进者的经验，生产革新者的倡议，优秀的斯达哈诺夫者、科学、技术、艺术工作者的成就。列宁在三十多年前就指示说：苏维埃报纸负有使命“把具体的实际的劳动问题放在”首要地位。列宁的指示，成为工厂小报活动的方向。全苏驰名的“巴黎公社”鞋厂女工柯拉别尔尼科娃所提倡的联合节约方法和每月拿出一天用节约的材料来生产的创议，受到了鞋厂报纸《公社员》的唱和。电车女司机顿尼科娃所提倡的对电车及其他公共交通工具施行社会主义负责保护制的创议，受到了“莫斯科电车报”的支持。诸如此类，首先受工厂小报介绍和支持，而后推广和风行全国的事实，说明了工厂小报的作用。
    下面是莫斯科一家工厂小报——卡冈诺维奇国家轴承工厂《斯大林的号召报》的例子。
    两间房子，窗户朝着工厂的院子，——这是平常的编辑部。
    电话铃响了，编辑部一个工作人员拿起电话筒，依照记者的习惯，拿出小本子，小声地说：“喂！这是‘斯大林的号召报’编辑部。车间主任吗？有什么新的事情？提前完成了一个月计划！很好。……不，关于详细的情形，我亲自去问。这样的材料，不能在电话上访问。”他拿着小本子向外跑了。
    一个又一个访问者走进编辑部来。一个车间工会负责人拿来了压榨机部斯达哈诺夫者值班的成绩。两个工厂体育会运动员来诉说体育会没有保证给参加五一检阅的服装。一个打铁工人送来了他写的保卫和平的诗。
    工厂报纸的题材很广。然而他发表的一切东西，服从于唯一的目的：为完成生产计划而斗争。这目的鼓舞着全体编辑部工作人员和工人通讯员。
    参加报纸工作的人不少：差不多有二百个经常的工人通讯员。《斯大林的号召报》的力量在于它是集体的宣传家、鼓动家和组织者。
    《斯大林的号召报》新闻工作者的功劳，在于他们能够从几千人的工厂的集体生活上，从许许多多现象和事实中，选最典型的、最特出的、推动工厂进步的、加速工厂速度的、提高劳动生产率的现象和事实。报纸疼爱地支持每一个新创议，解释和推广创始人的经验，展示这些创议的爱国主义的深刻的根源。
    翻阅一下《斯大林的号召报》合订本，那么就可以看到亚历山大·布洛夫发起的“贯彻组运动”是怎样生长和扩大的。曾经有一个时候，工厂有这样的规矩，修理匠只关心使他那一班工人满意。只有他看到冷眼看待的车床维持不到下一班时，才着手修理它。布洛夫提出了修理匠劳动的新组织方法。现在一切车床都是在开动中而且完全完好的交代下一班，随着这种情况，修理匠劳动报酬的原则也改变了：他们的工资不是按班次来计算，而是按修理组照顾全部车床的生产率来计算。报纸广泛宣传布洛夫的宝贵的新建议，鼓动把它贯彻到生产的实践中去。我们很快知道了，工厂的第一个贯彻组修理匠的工资提高了百分之一百五十，管理车床工人的工资也适当地提高了。经常修理得好好的车床的劳动生产率增长了百分之四十，不合格的产品减少了一半。《斯大林的号召报》反映了去年和今年头几个月全体工人的进展过程，他们的创造性的探讨和生产的成就。我们看到了，继着贯彻组，整个贯彻部也建立起来了。布洛夫发起的运动推广到非生产的车间。斯达哈诺夫者的创造性思想，产生了新的创议：工人们对贵重的度量计器施行社会主义保护制。接着，根据技师依凡诺夫和巴拉梭夫的创议，开始了工程师技师和工人之间社会主义合作运动。
    四十多个壁报和许多漫画壁报的经常工作人员，是工人通讯员当中的积极分子。《斯大林的号召报》几乎每期都向读者报告有那些新漫画壁报出版了。这些漫画用工人画家和通讯员的锋锐的笔跟生产和生活中的缺点作斗争。
    《斯大林的号召报》的批评文章、通讯和小品文瞄得很准。最近根据报纸的材料解除了一个修理车间主任和轮轴车间的一个组长的职务，因为他们的领导作风不良。编辑部发表了一篇叙述不负责地对待一个新建设（关于节约有色金属的建议）的文章，叫做“一个重要新建设的苦命”，经理处为了处理这件事下了命令。
    莫斯科最大工厂之一的战斗的布尔什维克新闻工作者就是这样工作着，这是熟练的、有目的的、热情的、真正专业的工作。这里有莫斯科唯一的工厂新闻研究室，常常有许多壁报的编辑和工作人员集合在那里交换经验。《斯大林的号召报》的许多文章、通讯，都写得有趣、活泼。不久前编辑部向读者提出一个问题：“如果在国际拥护和平会议上要你讲演的话，你说什么话？”许多斯达哈诺夫者、工程师、科学工作者、医生、家庭主妇的回答中，充满着对社会主义国家和斯大林同志的热爱，要求世界和平，痛恨战争挑拨者。
