　　Nationwide General Inspection of Grain Depots
    Many Regions Emphasize Grain Storage; Several Shortcomings Require Vigilance and Correction
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Following the notices issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and the Ministry of Finance regarding strengthening the work of public grain storage, public grain management departments across the country mostly launched grain inspection work before the start of summer. The East China Grain Bureau dispatched four inspection teams, employing a work method of "breakthrough on key points, comprehensive mobilization" to conduct warehouse inspections. The Hebei Provincial Grain Bureau dispatched 20 cadres from the provincial bureau and 9 cadres from district warehouses, forming 8 groups, combined with 94 district and warehouse cadres, to go deep into various counties to conduct inspections. The Pingyuan Provincial Grain Bureau, learning from the lessons of grain damage last year, had the director of the grain bureau personally lead the inspection work and transferred 12 cadres from the provincial bureau and more than 60 students from cadre schools, dividing them to work in various prefectures and counties, with particular emphasis on Puyang Prefecture, conducting a comprehensive inspection. The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government also sent cadres to assist in the work.
  Most Regions Emphasize Grain Storage Work
  Model Examples Appear in Many Regions
    During the inspection work, it was learned that many local governments and grain departments from top to bottom attached considerable importance to and made considerable efforts in grain storage work, and launched mass grain protection work. Commissioner Wang of Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province, personally went to the grain depot to inspect the grain. The magistrate of Mancheng County personally led more than 20 cadres to help rescue grain in the rain. The head of the Public Security Bureau also participated, and within two hours, more than 70,000 jin of grain were unloaded. Director Cui of Zhuoxian County Depot personally tied himself with a rope around his waist and had others pull him to the top of the large grain pile to sort out the grain. Magistrate Ma of Guangzong County constantly went to the grain depot to inspect and guide the work, and urged cadres to study storage methods. Director of Tangshan Prefecture Qian'an County branch depot led all cadres to personally unload about 200,000 jin from three rice depots. A female comrade surnamed Feng in Huolu Chengguan promoted grain protection at mass meetings and helped establish neighborhood grain protection groups. For example, Xu Hongqian, a temporary warehouse keeper in Xuzhuang, although old, was very active and conscientious in his work, braving the rain to inspect during the rainy season, and personally repaired the warehouses after the rain. There are many other similar examples. The Zichuan County Party Committee in Shandong Province proposed the slogan of strengthening grain storage, "internal storage" and "external defense," and has achieved preliminary results. The grain protection organizations in Jiaodong's Jimo, Jubei, Pingnan, Jiao, Huang and other counties are even tighter, with most of the granary cadres and militia self-defense teams taking turns guarding the warehouses at night. The director of the Daquan District Grain Depot in Yiyuan County set an example in storage work, implementing "diligent mind" (i.e., constantly considering unfinished work), "diligent hands" (i.e., diligently tidying up storage tools, etc.) and "diligent legs" (i.e., frequently inspecting the grain depot and patrolling at night). The neighborhood grain protection group in Zichuan Longquan District also formulated its own plan, holding two grain protection meetings every month to ensure no fires or thefts occur, reporting any incidents immediately, and in the event of an emergency at night, the neighborhood grain protection group would gather at the grain depot upon signal. Thanks to the attention of leaders at all levels in Lanxi County, Zhejiang, except for Majian Houren District, all districts have established grain protection and storage committees, and each warehouse has armed guards (district squad, county brigade, township government). Most of the various systems are also observed and implemented. Since the autumn grain levy of 1949, there have been no cases of robbery or theft.
    From this inspection, the following problems that generally existed in grain management work in various places in the past were also discovered:
  Public Grain Revenue and Expenditure System is Imperfect
  Management of Grain Affairs Fees is Not Strict Enough
    First, the public grain revenue and expenditure system is imperfect, the use of grain coupons and the management of grain affairs fees are not strict enough, and most grain depot accountants cannot close accounts on time or handle reporting procedures. There are still many cases of unauthorized use of public grain, with discrepancies between the books and the inventory. The Gu'an County government in Hebei Province misappropriated more than 20,000 jin of public grain, and the expenditure of grain affairs fees was chaotic. For example, the director of the Neiqiu County branch depot (concurrently the head of the Finance Section) in Xingtai Prefecture arbitrarily lent 3 million yuan to the county agency's production oil mill, 1 million yuan to the Finance Section, and 840 sacks to the agency's production oil mill, supply and marketing cooperative, and grain company, and 3,120 jin of rice and 1,746 jin of grain to the county joint cooperative and grain company. There are many other similar examples. The director of the No. 1 Warehouse of the Wuxi Grain Bureau arbitrarily withdrew 850 jin of rice. While the books in northern Anhui showed a surplus of more than 25 million jin of rice, the actual inventory in the warehouse was more than 50 million jin. Violations of the grain coupon system included: The Wuji County branch depot of Dingxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, used grain coupons to pay for the purchase of vehicles, cloth, and barber equipment.
  Satisfied with Narrow Experience
  Ideological Paralysis and Even Corruption
    Second, there is satisfaction with past narrow experience, ideological paralysis, and serious bureaucratic work styles, and even corruption. A small number of grain cadres in Qianhu District, Yin County, Zhejiang, had insufficient understanding of the climate and rainy season in the south, made the mistake of empiricism, and were ideologically paralyzed, thinking that everything would be fine after the grain was put into storage. Cadres of the Quyang County Depot in Hebei Province even mistook two thefts for rat eating until all the grain was gone. An Qingxiang, a temporary warehouse keeper in Yinyao Village, Puyang County, Pingyuan Province, was irresponsible in his work, the warehouse walls cracked, the grain was scattered, and he even colluded with village cadres to embezzle 140 jin of wheat. An accountant of a grain depot in Hang County, Zhejiang, colluded with the township chief to embezzle public grain worth one jin, twelve taels, eight qian and five fen of gold. Wang You, Li Shu, Zhang Qingxi and others, temporary warehouse keepers in Chu Wang, Neihuang County, Pingyuan Province, embezzled 15,000 jin of public grain.
  Not Closely Connected with Relevant Departments
  Did Not Mobilize the Masses to Participate in Grain Protection
    Third, there is a lack of close contact with relevant departments, and insufficient attention is paid to mass grain protection work. The contact between the No. 1 Warehouse of the Wuxi Grain Bureau and the fire brigade of the Public Security Department is only known to superiors, and other cadres are unaware of it. There is even less contact with surrounding residents.
    The Qizhi warehouse in Qianhu District, Zhejiang, relies on the idea of garrison troops protecting grain and relying on the township government, and does not pay attention to contacting the masses and establishing grain protection organizations, so that grain protection work is limited to the government and the army, losing the assistance of the masses.
  Neglecting Technical Research on Grain Storage
  Even Simple Equipment is Not Scientific Enough
    In addition, many regions generally neglect technical research on grain storage, and insufficient attention is paid to the moisture content of grain, the temperature inside the grain depot, and pest control equipment; some grain depots are equipped with ventilation equipment, but the installation is not scientific enough. The Ningbo warehouse set up ventilation pipes on the floor, with bamboo cages installed on top. Although this could ventilate, the humid air underground flowed into the warehouse with the wind, increasing the moisture content of the grain. In other places, such as Qianhu District in Yin County and Changyuan County in Pingyuan Province, the temperature and moisture content of some stored grain do not meet standards. About 4,000 jin of wheat in the Yinyao Village Temporary Depot in Puyang County, Pingyuan Province, was mildewed. Later, it was found to be infested with insects, and the temporary warehouse keeper said, "If insects are born, what can I do?"
    After these problems were discovered during this inspection, they have aroused the attention of leaders at all levels and public grain management departments. After the inspection, they have successively begun to correct them. For example, the East China Grain Bureau has armed guards stationed at all existing centralized grain depots, and grain scattered in various places is concentrated in towns. The Hebei Provincial Grain Bureau has also created some storage methods, such as using reed-woven pepper-eye-shaped curtains instead of wire mesh to prevent birds, using a bottle of wine with a peeled sorghum stalk stopper in the bottle mouth, buried in three to five feet deep in the wheat pile of three to five million jin, and storing what kind of grain in what kind of chaff can prevent insects; laying ash or wheat chaff on the bottom of the warehouse, then building bricks or placing sleepers and then laying reed mats or sorghum stalks or smooth stalks (i.e. wheat straw stalks) can prevent moisture and mildew.

　　全国普遍检查粮库
    不少地区重视保管粮食  若干缺点亟应警惕纠正
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会及财政部先后发出关于加强公粮保管工作的通知后，全国各地公粮管理部门，大部已于入夏前先后展开粮食检查工作。华东区粮食局派出四个检查组，以“重点突破、全面发动”的工作方式进行查仓。河北省粮食局由省局派干部二十人、区库九人混合编为八组，结合区库干部共九十四人，分赴各专县深入检查。平原省粮食局接受去年损坏粮食的教训，粮食局长亲自领导检查工作，并抽调省局干部十二人、干校学员六十余人，分赴各专、县工作，并特别以濮阳专区为重点，进行全面检查。中央人民政府财政部亦派干部前往协助工作。
  大部重视粮食保管工作
  不少地区出现模范事例
    各地在检查工作中，了解到不少地方政府与粮食部门自上而下地对粮食保管工作，均相当重视与努力，并展开了群众护粮工作。河北省保定专区王专员，亲自到粮库检查粮食。满城县长亲自率领二十多个干部，在雨中帮助抢救粮食，公安局长也参加，不到两个钟头，即倒完七万多斤粮食。涿县库崔主任亲自用绳索捆在腰间，让别人将他曳到大粮囤的顶上去整理粮食。广宗县马县长不断到粮库检查指导工作，并督促干部研究保管办法。唐山专区迁安县分库主任带领全体干部亲自倒三个米库约二十万斤。获鹿城关一位姓冯的女同志，在群众会上宣传护粮，并帮助建立护粮四邻小组。平原濮阳专区朝城县县长亲任护粮委员会主任，健全了县、区、村护粮组织，一年来从未发生过公粮被抢劫偷盗等事件。再如徐庄代库库员徐洪乾等，虽然年老，但工作十分积极认真，雨季冒雨检查，雨后亲自动手抢修库仓。其他类似例子还很多。山东省淄川县委提出加强粮食保管必须作到“对内保管”、“对外保卫”的口号，并已获有初步收获。胶东即墨、莒北、平南、胶、黄等县的护粮组织更为严密，绝大部分粮仓干部和民兵自卫团，分班夜间站岗护仓。沂源县大泉区粮库主任在保管工作上以身作则，实行了“心勤”（即经常考虑应作未作的工作）、“手勤”（保管工具勤收拾等）、“腿勤”（即经常检查粮库并夜间巡查）。淄川龙泉区的四邻护粮组，并自行订定计划，每月开二次护粮会议，保证不发生火灾、偷盗，有事随时报告，夜间发生意外，以号为令，四邻护粮组即到粮库集合。浙江兰溪县由于各级领导的重视，除马涧厚仁区外，各区皆已建立了护粮保管委员会，各库皆有武装看护（区中队、县大队、乡政府）。各种制度亦绝大部分遵守执行。自一九四九年秋征入库后，迄今从未发生抢劫、偷盗等案件。
    从这次检查中，同时也发现了过去各地粮食管理工作中，普遍存在以下几个问题：
  公粮收支制度不健全
  粮务费掌握不够严紧
    首先是公粮收支制度不健全，粮票使用和粮务费的掌管不够严紧，大部分粮库会计不能按期结账，办理报解手续。擅自动用公粮，账面与库存不符现象还很多。河北省固安县政府挪用公粮两万多斤，粮务费开支混乱。如邢台专区内邱县分库主任（财政科长兼）擅自借给县机关生产油坊三百万元，财政科一百万元，借给机关生产油坊、供销社、粮食公司麻袋八四○条，借给县联社米三、一二○斤、粮食公司一、七四六斤；其他类似的例子还不少。无锡市粮食局第一仓库主任擅自动支大米八五○斤；皖北账存米二千五百余万斤，而库实存却有五千余万斤。破坏粮票制度的如：河北省定县专区无极县分库购买车子、布、理发器具等，均以粮票付价。
  满足于狭隘的经验
  思想麻痹且有贪污
    其次，满足于过去狭隘的经验，思想麻痹，存在严重的官僚主义作风，甚至有贪污现象。浙江鄞县钱湖区少数粮食干部，对江南气温及霉雨季节认识不足，犯了经验主义的错误，思想麻痹，以为粮食入仓后即百事大吉。河北省曲阳县库干部，竟将两次失盗误认为鼠吃，直到粮食出尽才发现。平原省濮阳县尹窑村代库代库员安庆祥对工作不负责，仓房撑裂，粮食失散，还结合村干部贪污小麦一四○斤。浙江杭县一粮库会计结合乡保长贪污公粮价值黄金一斤十二两八钱五分。平原省内黄县楚旺代库员王有、李澍、张青西等贪污公粮一万五千斤。
  与有关部门联系不密切
  没有发动群众参加护粮
    再次，缺乏与有关部门密切联系，对群众性的护粮工作重视不够。无锡市粮食局第一仓库对外与公安部门救火会的联系，仅上级晓得，其他干部则不知道。对周围居民联系更少。
    浙江钱湖区五乡碶仓库，存在依赖驻军护粮与依赖乡政府的思想，不注意联系群众，建立护粮组织，致护粮工作仅限于政府军队，失去群众力量的协助。
  忽视粮食保管的技术研究
  即有简单设备亦不够科学
    此外，不少地区普遍忽视粮食保管的技术研究，粮食所含水分与粮库内温度及防虫设备均重视不够；有的粮库虽设有通风设备，而装置不够科学。宁波市仓库在地板上设置通气筒，上装竹笼，虽能通气，但地下潮湿气随风流入仓内，致粮食增加了水分。其他如鄞县钱湖区、平原省长垣县等地，有些粮库存粮温度含水量均不合标准。平原省濮阳县尹窑村代库霉蚀小麦约四千余斤，后发现生虫，该代库员反说“生了虫子，我有什么办法。”
    以上问题经过这次检查、发现后，已引起各级领导及公粮管理部门的注意。在检查后，并已先后着手纠正。如华东区粮食局对现有之集中粮库，均由武装驻守警卫，散存各地的粮食向城镇集中。河北省粮食局并创造了一些保管办法，如以苇编胡椒眼形的帘子代铁丝网防雀，以酒一瓶，瓶口塞以去皮的秫秸塞，埋入三至五万斤麦粮堆内二、三尺深处，及仓内存什么粮盖什么糠，均可防虫；于仓底先铺灰或麦糠，其上砌砖或放枕木后再铺苇席或秫秸、滑秸（即麦穰秸）等可以防潮湿和霉坏。
