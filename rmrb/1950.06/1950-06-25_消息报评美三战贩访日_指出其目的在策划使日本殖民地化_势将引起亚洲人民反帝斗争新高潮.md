Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 23rd: *Izvestia*'s observer commented on the visits to Japan by John Foster Dulles, a senior adviser to the U.S. State Department, Defense Secretary James Forrestal, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Omar Bradley.

The observer pointed out: The trip to Japan by these three notorious warmongers is related to the study of plans for the long-term control of Japan by U.S. imperialism and plans to turn Japan into a U.S. colony in reality. Although the current U.S. occupation policy, thanks to MacArthur's efforts, has become a policy of colonizing Japan, it does not give Washington much hope. The U.S. occupation authorities' policy of openly restoring Japanese militarism and restoring the domestic police regime has aroused the growing resistance of the broad masses of the Japanese people. The U.S. efforts to turn Japan into a military springboard against the Soviet Union, New China, and the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia, and to use the Japanese people as "cannon fodder" for the gambling of U.S. imperialists, have aroused the growing and widespread anger of the Japanese people. Japanese workers are demanding the early conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty and the withdrawal of U.S. occupation forces; they are protesting against the U.S. attempt to deprive Japan of its national independence and against the U.S. construction of military bases on the Japanese islands.

In such circumstances, Washington has encountered the question of how to maintain and consolidate U.S. control over Japan and how to suppress the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism. This problem, which U.S. imperialists cannot solve, has caused differences of opinion between the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense.

The idea of concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan to maintain indefinite U.S. control over the country has resurfaced in the State Department. This plan by the State Department has not satisfied U.S. militarists, who fear that the trick will eventually be exposed, and that even a fake peace treaty will to some extent limit their "freedom of action."

In short, U.S. militarists want to turn Japan into a U.S. colony without disguise. MacArthur, the representative of these militarists, believes that the Japanese people's resistance to the U.S. policy of colonizing Japan can and must be broken by naked fascist methods. The declaration of the illegality of the leading organs of the Japanese Communist Party and the police suppression of the progressive democratic movement of the Japanese people are manifestations of this policy.

The observer concluded that the police terror in Japan, which began under MacArthur's orders, is proof of the weakness of U.S. imperialism in the Far East, not proof of its strength. The trip by Dulles, Bradley, and Forrestal is due to the fact that MacArthur's occupation policy has reached a dead end. However, as the facts show, the visit to Japan by these three warmongers can only arouse a new upsurge in the struggle of the Asian people against their deadly enemy—U.S. imperialism.

　　消息报评美三战贩访日
    指出其目的在策划使日本殖民地化
    势将引起亚洲人民反帝斗争新高潮
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：消息报观察家就美国国务院高级顾问杜勒斯、国防部长詹逊、参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷等访问日本一事发表评论。
    观察家指出：这三个著名战争贩子的日本之行，是与研究美帝国主义长期控制日本计划，把日本实际上变成美国殖民地计划有关。虽然由于麦克阿瑟的努力，目前美国的占领政策已成为使日本殖民地化的政策，但是，并不能引起华盛顿方面很大的希望。美国驻日占领当局所采取的公然恢复日本军国主义与恢复国内警察政权的政策，已引起广大日本人民群众的日益增长的反抗。美国努力要把日本变成反对苏联、新中国和东南亚民族解放运动的军事跳板，要把日本人民充作美帝国主义者赌博的“炮灰”，这已引起日本人民日益增长的普遍愤怒。日本的职工们要求尽早缔结全面和约，撤退美国占领军；他们抗议美国企图剥夺日本的民族独立，抗议美国在日本各岛建筑军事基地。
    在这样的情况下，华盛顿方面就遭遇到如何保持并且巩固美国对日的控制，如何镇压日本人民反对美帝国主义斗争的问题。这个美帝国主义者所不能解决的问题，引起了美国国务院与国防军事部门之间意见的分歧。
    与日本缔结单独和约，以保持美国无限期地控制这个国家，这样的意见又在国务院抬头了。国务院这个计划并没有使美国军国主义者感到满足，他们恐怕这个骗局终将暴露，而且即使是假和约，在某种程度上也将限制他们的“行动自由”。
    简单地说，美国军国主义者想毫不掩饰地把日本变成美国的殖民地。这些军国主义者的代表麦克阿瑟认为：日本人民对于美国把日本殖民地化政策的反抗，是能够而且必须用赤裸裸的法西斯方法来打破的。宣布日本共产党领导机关的非法，用警察镇压日本人民的进步民主运动，都是这一政策的表现。
    观察家结语称，在麦克阿瑟命令下开始的日本警察恐怖，乃是证明美国帝国主义在远东地位的脆弱，而不是证明其强大。杜勒斯、布莱德雷与詹逊的此行，是由于麦克阿瑟的占领政策已经走入绝路。然而，正如事实所显示的，三个战争贩子此次的访问日本，只能引起亚洲人民反对他们的死敌——美国帝国主义——的斗争的新高潮。
