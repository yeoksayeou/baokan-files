    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Troops from the Yunnan and Eastern Sichuan Military Regions of the People's Liberation Army are actively helping poor people transplant rice seedlings and harvest wheat. From May 10th to 12th, the direct unit of a certain division of the Lijiang Garrison District of the Yunnan Military Region extracted 1,091 people to help 144 local farmers plow 678 mu of fields and harvest 28 mu of beans. Local armed forces, who had just returned from suppressing bandits in the area, also extracted more than 500 people during their reorganization and training to help farmers in more than 20 villages in the resident area to produce. In three days, they plowed 154 mu of fields and harvested 129.7 mu of beans. Soldiers volunteered to help poor villagers transplant rice seedlings and harvest wheat.
    Cadres of a certain regiment of the Eastern Sichuan Military Region personally jumped into the paddy fields to help farmers transplant rice seedlings. From May 8th to 15th, the regiment helped poor farmers transplant 140 mu of rice seedlings and harvest 12 mu of wheat, beans and other miscellaneous grains in one week. It rained heavily for three days on the 8th, 9th and 10th, but the soldiers did not stop. Each unit also put forward competitions. The competition conditions included helping the masses without delaying study, not dropping a single grain of wheat during harvesting, transplanting rice seedlings well, not eating villagers' things, publicizing policies and discipline, and improving the relationship between the army and the people.
