　　Denouncing Truman
    Peng Zemin
    American imperialism's aggressive East Asia conspiracy, not hesitating to provoke a world war, has actually issued statements and naval actions, directly attempting armed aggression against us. Since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has called for the defense of world peace every day. Truman, Acheson, and others, who clamor for war every day, willingly act as enemies of peace-loving people around the world, exposing their ambition to invade Asia. We firmly support the statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and will certainly unite as a nation to strive to the end to protect our territory. The intimidation of the American imperialists will never make our people afraid!

    美帝国主义的强霸东亚阴谋，不惜挑起世界战争，竟然发出声明和海军行动，直欲对我作武装侵略。我中华人民共和国自建立以来无日不以保卫世界和平相号召，乃日以战争为叫嚣的杜鲁门艾奇逊等，甘作世界爱好和平人民的公敌，暴露其侵略亚洲的企图，我们坚决拥护外交部长周恩来的声明，必当全国一致戳力同心为保护我国领土奋斗到底，美帝国主义者的恫吓，断不能使我人民有所畏怯的！
