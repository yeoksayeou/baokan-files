　　In a Big Family
    Shijingshan Power Plant Branch Unites Workers and Staff
    The General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China Shijingshan Power Plant

    Since July of last year, the Shijingshan Power Plant Branch of Beijing has paid attention to uniting and cooperating with non-Party masses. After half a year of effort, by the end of March this year, it clearly put forward that: closely uniting the masses to carry out production is the task of every Party member. It also specifically stipulated a plan that each Party member must unite with at least one member of the masses. Now these have been achieved and are being done very well. Comrade Zhang Limin, the branch secretary of the Boiler A class, is a good example of uniting the masses. He first influenced foreman Zhang Yusan to work for seven hours in the air preheater at a high temperature of over 40 degrees through his own exemplary role. He also worked with other workers to study the replacement of the No. 14 furnace grate, which reduced coal consumption by 37 percent. He and staff member Liu Duzhi jointly proposed a rationalization proposal to improve ventilation. After staff member Pan Qiutai put forward a rationalization proposal to change the water supply system, he discussed and supplemented it with the workers of the whole class, supporting the proposal. In particular, he led the staff and workers to break with conservative ideas and implemented the suggestion of Soviet engineers to raise the high-pressure water tank temperature to 103 degrees Celsius, saving a lot of coal. In addition, he united the workers of the whole class to protect the machines, exposed the sabotage plot of saboteur Li Xiutian to destroy the machines; and solved the problem of disunity between Song Wenying and Zhang Yusan. He was also able to humbly learn technology from technicians. Comrade Han Boqin, a member of the Steam Turbine Branch Committee, also united well with the masses, jointly studied the vibration problem of the No. 6 machine, and put forward rationalization proposals. When training lathe operator Zhang Xueyi, Comrade Han patiently talked to Zhang Xueyi more than ten times, persuading him to study hard. Therefore, when another lathe operator in the same class requested to join the Party, he specifically asked to talk to him, requesting his help.

    The Party members of Shijingshan Power Plant, from all aspects, closely unite the workers and staff around them, and work together to increase production.

    First, they unite the masses in production, study technology with the masses, and jointly put forward rationalization proposals. For example, Party member Liu Mingqing and Yang Jinsheng, a worker in his class, studied and restored the water supply office's proposal. With the support and help of staff member Zhu Zhimuo, it was realized, and a plant-wide rationalization proposal movement was launched. Zhu Zhimuo's proposal to use a pressure reducing valve was supported and jointly tested by Party member Zhou Hongsheng, so tens of thousands of catties of millet could be saved throughout the year. These rationalization proposals show a common feature, that is, they are all proposed and mutually supported by Party members and non-Party workers and staff.

    Secondly, Party members unite workers and staff through their own exemplary role. In all kinds of production activities in the plant, in the most difficult and arduous places, Party members always act first. Once, it was difficult to transport coal due to heavy rain, and Party members Zhao Tongyun and others took the lead in completing the task. When an accident occurred with the No. 5 circulating pump after work hours, the branch committee members and Party members of the steam turbine and electrical departments automatically rushed to participate in the repair, working for more than four hours. This temporary accident only delayed dozens of work hours and did not affect the monthly production plan.

    Party members can truly humbly learn technology from the masses and help the masses to learn, which is also a way to unite workers and staff. Party member Lü Changqing could not draw drawings, so he humbly went to the engineers to learn. When others couldn't draw, he quickly taught others what he had learned. Party member Zhang Yuting (an old worker) signed the plant's first apprenticeship contract with a young worker, and taught him a month's worth of learning content in half a month. This made the masses realize that Party members are truly practical and realistic, learning when they don't know, and teaching when they do know. This spirit should be learned.

    Another method is to actively help the masses progress politically, so that the political awareness of the masses is constantly improved, and they are determined to follow the Communist Party. Gui Shixiang, a member of the Repair Branch Committee, spent three months helping his united object abandon Yiguandao and believe in the Communist Party. Many workers and staff talked to the Party about their thoughts and "heart diseases." Some people even told the Party about their past criminal history.

    The last method is that Party members are very concerned and take care of the lives of the masses. When the coal feeder looked after by coal feeder worker Zhuang Baoshan broke down, the Party members of the Boiler C class not only helped him repair it, but also helped him find medicine and bandage his hand after Zhuang's hand was cut. Afterwards, they went to comfort him, making him feel happy and comforted. Some Party members also helped non-Party masses repair their houses. Old worker He Yu said: "If it weren't for everyone's help, my house would not have been repaired."

    Therefore, the non-Party masses all felt happy and comforted, as if they were in a big family. They are closer to the Party, dedicating their technology to the Party and the people, and working hard for the Party and the people.

### 在一个大家庭里  石景山发电厂支部团结了工人和职员

　　在一个大家庭里
    石景山发电厂支部团结了工人和职员
    中共石景山发电厂总支委员会
    北京市石景山发电厂支部，从去年七月起，就注意了与非党群众的团结合作。经过半年的努力，至今年三月底，又明确的提出了：紧密团结群众进行生产是每一个党员的任务。并具体规定了每一个党员至少必须团结好一个群众的计划。现在这些都作到了。并且都作得很好。锅炉甲班分支书张利民同志就是团结群众的一个好例子。他首先以自己的模范作用，影响了领班张玉三在四十多度的高温空气预热器中工作七小时之久。又和其他工人研究改换了十四号炉条，使煤耗减低了百分之三十七。他和职员刘笃智共同提出了改善通风的合理化建议。在职员潘求泰提出了改变给水系统的合理化建议后，他就和全班工人一起讨论补充，支持了这项建议。特别是他带动了职员、工人打破了保守思想，实现了苏联工程师的建议，把高压水箱温度提高到摄氏一○三度，省煤很多。此外，他团结全班工人保护了机器，揭发了破坏分子李秀田破坏机器的阴谋；又解决了宋文英和张玉三不团结问题，他并且能够虚心的向技术人员学习技术。汽机分支委韩伯勤同志也和群众团结很好，一起研究六号机的震动问题，并提出了合理化建议。在培养旋工能手张学义时，韩同志耐心的和张学义一连谈话十多次，劝他好好学习。因而同班另一旋工要求入党时，指名要和他谈话，要求他的帮助。
    石景山发电厂的党员，从各方面把工人、职员紧紧团结在自己的周围，共同为增加生产而奋斗。
    首先，他们从生产中团结群众，和群众一起研究技术，共同提出合理化建议。例如党员刘明清和他班工人杨金声研究恢复给水办建议，在职员朱致墨的支持和帮助下得到了实现，并由此掀起了全厂合理化建议运动。而朱致墨的使用减压弁的建议又为党员周鸿声所支持和共同试验，因此全年可节省小米数十万斤。这些合理化建议表现了一个共同的特点，就是都由党员与非党工人、职员共同提出与互相支持实现的。
    其次，党员以自己的模范作用，团结了工人和职员。在全厂各种生产活动中，在最困难和最艰苦的地方，总是党员首先行动。有一次下大雨运煤困难，党员赵同云等就带头完成了任务。五号循环泵在下班时间出了事故，汽机、电气的支委、党员自动赶去参加修理，一直工作了四个多小时。使这次临时事故只耽误了数十个工，没有影响全月生产计划。
    党员们真正能够虚心的向群众学习技术，并帮助群众学习，也是团结工人和职员的一个方法。党员吕长庆不会画图，他就虚心的向工程师去学习。当别人不会画时，他又赶快把自己所学习的教给别人。党员张雨亭（老工人）与一个青工订了全厂第一个师徒合同，半月就教会了一个月学习的内容。这样使群众认识了党员真是实事求是，不会就学，会的就教，这种精神是应当学习的。
    再一个办法是在政治上积极的帮助群众进步，使群众的政治觉悟不断提高，有决心跟随着共产党走。修理分支委桂士祥用了三个月时间，帮助自己的团结对象放弃了一贯道，相信了共产党。许多工人、职员向党谈出了自己的心思与“心病”。甚至有人，把过去的罪恶历史，也告诉了党。
    最后一个办法是党员们对群众的生活十分关心和照顾。运煤器工人庄宝山看守的运煤器坏了，锅炉丙班分支党员不但帮助他修理，在庄的手被割破后，还帮他找药包扎。事后又去安慰他，使他感到了愉快和安慰。有些党员还帮助非党群众修理房屋。老工人何玉说：“要没有大家帮忙，我的房子就修不上了。”
    因此，非党群众都感到了愉快和安慰，像是在一个大家庭里一样。更加靠近了党，把自己的技术献给党，献给人民，为党为人民好好地工作。
