　　A Record of the Workers' Garden Party
    By our reporter Feng Zhong
    On June 25th, the capital's workers held an unprecedented large-scale garden party. As the sun rose, thousands upon thousands of workers from all over the city poured into the Palace of Culture for the Working People. Under the towering ancient pine trees, groups of workers sat in circles, playing collective games. The sounds of waist drums and songs echoed in every corner. In the cultural garden, labor heroes were reporting on how they created new records; in front of the main hall, there were endless song and dance performances; on the sports field, basketball, volleyball, and track and field competitions took place one after another; the radio continuously broadcast recordings of workers singing folk arts, dramas, and songs; in the afternoon, there were new folk arts and technical performances; in the evening, movies were shown. With thousands of programs, the garden was filled with joyful sounds all day long.
    Under the leadership of their own political party, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class, after arduous struggles, has achieved liberation, transformed from the oppressed and exploited into the leading class of society, from slaves of machines into masters of machines, living a free and happy life. A few days before the Party's birthday, they gathered together, reminiscing about the past and looking forward to the future, how could they not be happy? How could they not be excited? Many workers came to the garden party by train from suburban factories, and many workers also brought a day's worth of dry food, enjoying themselves to the fullest in their own Palace of Culture all day long.
    The magnificent performance of the Beijing Workers' six to seven hundred-person large waist drum team was one of the most exciting programs. The Telecommunications Bureau and Garment Factory workers' singing team and waist drum team also participated in the song and dance performances of the cultural troupe. The tug-of-war competition was entirely organized by workers' sports teams, and ball game and track and field worker athletes also showed off their skills.
    Liu Yingyuan, director of the Shijingshan Power Plant and labor hero, gave a speech, pointing out a path for workers on how to improve production. Zhao Guoyou, a specially invited delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and labor hero, reported in detail on how he created new records. He said: New records are not created by one person alone; as long as everyone is willing to use their brains, anyone can create them. Zhao Guoyou recently returned from a visit to the Soviet Union, and he also introduced the advanced production situation and the happy lives of workers in Soviet factories, and told everyone that this was achieved through hard work and struggle. Their speeches attracted the hearts of every comrade in the garden party. Movie cameras and more than a dozen cameras competed to capture the posture of the two labor heroes speaking. Workers becoming factory directors and representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference is the glory of the entire working class, and thousands upon thousands of workers are following their path forward.

　　记工人游园联欢大会
    本报记者  冯仲
    六月二十五日，首都工人举行空前大规模的游园联欢。太阳刚升起，来自全市各个工厂上千上万的工人，陆续涌进了劳动人民文化宫。耸天的古松树下，一群群工人围坐一圈，玩着集体游戏。腰鼓声，歌声，响遍每一个角落。文化园里，劳动英雄正报告怎样创造的新纪录；大殿前，有看不尽的歌舞表演，运动场上一场接一场的篮球、排球和田径赛；广播器不断地播送着工人演唱的曲艺、戏剧、歌咏的录音；下午又有新曲艺和技术表演；晚间放映电影。节目万千，满园竟日欢声洋溢。
    中国工人阶级在自己的政党——中国共产党的领导下，经过艰苦的斗争，获得了翻身解放，由被压迫被剥削者，变成社会的领导阶级，由机器的奴隶变成机器的主人，过着自由愉快的生活，在党的生日的前几天，欢聚在一起，抚今追昔，能不快乐？能不兴奋？许多工人由郊区工厂坐火车赶来游园，也有许多工人携带了一日干粮，在自己的文化宫里，尽情的欢乐终日。
    北京工人六、七百人大腰鼓队雄壮的表演，是最精彩的节目之一，电信局、被服厂工人歌咏队和腰彭队也参加了文工团的歌舞表演，拔河比赛完全是工人组织的运动队，球类和田径工人运动员也大显着身手。
    石景山发电厂厂长、劳动英雄刘英源讲话，给工人指出一条怎样搞好生产的道路；人民政协特邀列席代表劳动英雄赵国有详细报告了自己怎样创造的新纪录，他说：新纪录不是一个人创造的，只要大家肯用脑筋，谁都可以创造。赵国有最近访苏归来，他又介绍了苏联工厂先进的生产情况和工人美满的生活，并且告诉大家，这是在艰苦困难中，努力奋斗中得来的。他们的讲话吸引住每一个游园同志们的心。电影机、十几架照像机争着摄下两位劳动英雄讲话的姿态。工人当了厂长，当了人民政协的代表，这是全工人阶级的光荣，千千万万的工人正循着他们的道路前进。
