    Jiaozuo Mine Stops Operating Native Kilns
    In order to ensure the safety of workers' lives and avoid waste and loss of state property, the North China State-owned Jiaozuo Mining Bureau implemented the policy of "centralized wellheads and safe production," stopping the operation of native kilns and reducing the number of mines from three mines and eleven wellheads to two mines and four wellheads. After the centralization, the mine's daily output can still maintain around 1,970 tons, which still exceeds the planned average daily output of 1,935.84 tons for the mine in 1950. Each month, it saves 6,438 workers and staff in wellhead work, underground security work, roadway maintenance work, and miscellaneous work, and also saves a lot of materials such as pit props, mineral oil, and coal power.

    焦作矿停办土窑
    华北国营焦作矿务局为保障工人生命安全，避免国家财物浪费损失，执行“井口集中、安全生产”的方针，停办土窑，由过去的三个矿十一个井口减少到两个矿四个井口。集中后，该矿日产量仍能保持一千九百七十吨左右，仍超过一九五○年该矿平均日产一九三五点八四吨的计划产量。每月节省井上工、井下保安工、巷道修护工、杂工及职员达六千四百三十八人，其他坑木、矿物油、煤电等材料也节省很多。  （焦作煤矿总局工作组）
    雁北整顿小窑
