　　To ensure production safety and strictly guard against sabotage by spies and secret agents, nineteen enterprises and institutions under the Beijing Municipal Government's Bureau of Industry, Enterprise Companies, and Yongmao Company have, with the assistance of the Public Security Bureau, established mass security organizations in April and May, and have established security committees. Under the committees, security groups were also established. The tasks of the security groups are: preventing spies, preventing fires, preventing theft, preventing accidents, and protecting state secrets. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Huaxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory have formulated handover systems, machine safety responsibility systems, and conventions for warehouses and gatekeepers. The Tram Company and the Automobile Company have established safety groups to ensure road safety, implementing mutual supervision and inspection and a responsibility safety system. Hu Quangui, the chairman of the trade union at the South Repair Factory of the Tram Company, said at the security group members' meeting: "The factory is our rice bowl. Last year, the special agents burned our vehicles. We learned a lesson. The factory is our own, and everyone should have the responsibility to protect it." Before the establishment of the security group at the Huaxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory, theft and the throwing of stones into the factory often occurred, and the order within the factory was very chaotic. After the establishment of the security group, members suggested that the leadership improve and strengthen the system, and add necessary safety equipment. Currently, factory accidents have gradually decreased. Under the education of the security committee, workers in various enterprises have increased their sense of being masters of the country and have further recognized the importance of security work. Li Shun, a transmission worker at the Tram Company, said: "I have a responsibility here, and no one can enter or exit casually." Du Xingqi of the Automobile Company said: "Our company has had several fire alarms that were discovered early, and no problems occurred. We should be more vigilant in the future." Because various factories and enterprises feel the need for current security organizations, ten factories, including the Water Supply Company, Qinghe Woolen Mill, and Beijing Pottery Factory, are actively preparing for their establishment.

    京十九个企业单位建立安全组织
    【本报讯】京市府工业局、企业公司及永茂公司所属十九个企业单位，为保障生产安全，严防奸特破坏，已在公安局协助下于四、五两月份，先后建立了群众性的安全组织，并成立了安全委员会。委员会下，并成立了安全小组。安全小组的任务是：防奸，防火，防盗，防事故，保守国家机密。石景山钢铁厂、华兴染织厂并制定了接交班制度、机器安全责任制及仓库、门卫等公约。电车公司、汽车公司为了车路安全，建立了安全小组，实行互相督促检查及责任安全制。电车公司南修造厂工会主任胡泉桂，在安全组员大会上说：“工厂就是我们的饭碗子，去年特务把我们的车子烧了，我们得到教训，工厂是自己的，大家都应有责任保护。”华兴染织厂未建立安全小组以前，经常发生偷盗、厂内被投入石头的事情，厂内秩序很乱。安全小组建立后，组员建议领导上改进与健全制度，添设了必要的安全设备。现厂内事故已逐渐减少。各企业工人在安全委员会教育下，提高了国家主人翁的感觉，对安全工作有了进一步认识。电车公司的传达工友李顺说：“我这里有责任，谁也不能随便进进出出。”汽车公司杜兴歧说：“咱们公司几次火警都是发觉的早，没有发生问题，我们今后应该提高警惕。”由于各工厂企业感到目前安全组织的需要，自来水公司、清河制呢厂、北京窑业厂等十个厂也正积极筹备建立中。
