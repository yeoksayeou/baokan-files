Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 7th: The industrial and commercial situation in major cities of Hunan Province has begun to improve due to stable prices and strong support from the People's Government. Prices throughout the province have remained stable for the past two months. In mid-May, the composite price index of major commodities in eight cities including Changsha, Hengyang, Lingling, and Xiangtan rose by an average of only 4.98% compared to the first ten days of the month. Lingling saw the largest increase, at 9.1%, while Xiangtan had the smallest, at only 0.6%. The slight increase in prices was mainly due to state-owned trading companies taking the initiative to make adjustments to take into account the relationship between public and private sectors and between urban and rural areas. As a result, the unreasonable scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products is gradually shrinking. For example, one piece of 20-count cotton yarn can be exchanged for 6,433 jin of rice in Changsha and 7,149 jin in Hengyang, approaching the more reasonable ratio of 1936. Through appropriate adjustments by trading companies, market prices and list prices are becoming more balanced, and the gap between wholesale and retail prices is also becoming more reasonable. As a result, merchants can make profits, and retail and wholesale transactions are greatly invigorated. According to statistics from the Provincial Department of Commerce: in mid-May, the trading volume of rice merchants increased by 30.3% compared to the first ten days of the month; in the total volume of tung oil transactions for the entire month, the proportion accounted for by private merchants increased by 81.6% compared to April, and the sales volume of retail companies in Changsha also increased. At the same time, due to the People's Government correcting tax biases and providing private industrial and commercial enterprises with various forms of assistance such as commissioned processing, ordering, agency sales, and agency purchases, most industrial and commercial operators have begun to eliminate concerns and are actively engaged in improving operations, organizing joint ventures, raising funds, and improving production equipment. According to statistics from the Changsha Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce: more than 400 industrial and commercial households applied for business closure in April, but only more than 360 in May, and 152 were approved to open. In late May, another 87 applied to open. The capital of industrial and commercial households applying to open increased by 44.4% compared to the capital of those closing down. In addition, more than 50 households that had originally applied for business closure voluntarily withdrew their applications and continued to operate; and there are nearly 200 households that were approved for business closure in February but have not yet cancelled their business licenses, some of whom are still continuing to operate.

　　湖南工商业情况好转
    适当调整物价交易大为活跃
    【新华社长沙七日电】湖南省各主要城市的工商业情况由于物价稳定和人民政府的大力扶助已开始好转。全省物价近两月来始终保持平稳状态。五月中旬长沙、衡阳、零陵、湘潭等八个城市的主要商品价格综合指数平均只比上旬上涨百分之四点九八，以零陵上升较多，为百分之九点一，湘潭最少，仅达百分之零点六。物价微升的主要原因是国营贸易机关为照顾公私关系及城乡关系主动作了调整，工农业产品间不合理的剪刀差额因之日趋缩减，如每件二十支棉纱在长沙可换大米六千四百三十三斤，在衡阳可换七千一百四十九斤，已与一九三六年较合理的比率相接近。经过贸易机关的适当调整，市价与牌价趋于平衡，批发价与零售价距离亦渐趋合理，因之商人有利可图，零售与批发交易大为活跃。据省府商业厅统计：五月中旬米商交易数量较上旬增加百分之三十点三；全月桐油成交总量中，私商所占比率较四月份提高了百分之八十一点六，长沙市零售公司销货额也有增加。同时，由于人民政府纠正税收偏向，并予私营工商业以委托加工、订货、代销、代购等多方扶助，一般工商业者多已开始消除顾虑，转而积极从事改善经营，纷纷组织联营机构，调集资金，改善生产设备。据长沙市工商局统计：四月份中申请歇业的工商业户达四百家以上，五月份只有三百六十多家，另批准开业的有一百五十二家，五月下旬，又有八十七家申请开业。申请开业的工商业户的资金较歇业户的资金增加百分之四十四点四。此外，原已申请歇业又自动撤回申请而继续营业的有五十多家；还有二月份已批准歇业而至今尚未缴销营业证的近二百家，其中有部分仍在继续营业。
