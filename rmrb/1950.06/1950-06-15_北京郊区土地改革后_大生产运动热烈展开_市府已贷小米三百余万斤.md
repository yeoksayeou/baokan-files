Xinhua News Agency, June 11th - Following land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, the enthusiasm of the emancipated peasants for production has generally surged. With the strong assistance of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, they are enthusiastically devoting themselves to building prosperity through production, primarily striving to achieve this year's agricultural production plan with a 10% increase.

The suburbs of Beijing have a total of approximately 1,097,000 mu of cultivated land, of which over 300,000 mu are planted with winter wheat. This year in March, when land reform in the suburbs was completed in most rural areas, the suburban peasants, under the leadership of the government, actively carried out spring plowing preparations such as accumulating fertilizer, harrowing land, and delivering manure. Many emancipated peasants collected manure before dawn and enthusiastically went to the city to transport the silt dredged from the sewers being repaired in the urban areas and from the dredging of the North, Central, and South Seas to increase fertilizer application to the land. In addition, the Municipal People's Government loaned fertilizer worth over 1,855,000 catties of millet this year to help peasants purchase fertilizer, making fertilizer application in the suburbs generally more than double that of last year.

This year, suburban peasants are very enthusiastic about improving cultivation methods during spring plowing. Starting in early April, they intensified their plowing, ensuring that most of the autumn fields sown this year were plowed twice. Currently, except for a few low-lying areas, the sowing of major autumn crops has been completed. During sowing, some peasants also used superior crop seeds such as the "Huabei Agricultural Science Institute No. 1 Valley" developed by the North China Agricultural Science Institute. To prevent water and drought disasters and improve irrigation, they also actively repaired canals, renovated old wells, dug new wells, dredged rivers, and dug drainage ditches during spring plowing. As of now, all of this spring's planned drainage projects in the Beijing suburbs have been completed, and the dredging of rivers and excavation of canals are also nearing completion. Once these projects are fully completed, they will not only protect 120,000 mu of fertile land from flooding but also irrigate 19,000 mu of dry land. This year in April, over 6,000 mu of wheat in the suburbs were found to be infested with wheat sawflies, and 13,000 peasants immediately rose up under the leadership of the government to catch and kill them, eradicating them within half a month.

The Beijing Municipal People's Government has vigorously supported this production movement. This year, the municipal government's budget for agricultural loans to suburban peasants for developing production, including various loans for farm tools, draft animals, fertilizer, waterwheels, wells, and seeds, amounts to 4.5 million catties of millet, of which over 3,690,000 catties have already been loaned out. These loans have greatly helped solve various difficulties in peasants' production. The municipal government also conducted a spring epidemic prevention injection for livestock in the suburbs in March, injecting over 24,000 horses, mules, donkeys, cattle, and camels (accounting for over 80% of the livestock in the entire suburbs). Recently, the municipal government has begun to lend out over 700 new-style waterwheels. These new-style waterwheels are lighter and more convenient than the old-style waterwheels, and their prices are half that of the old-style waterwheels, making them popular among suburban peasants.

### 北京郊区土地改革后  大生产运动热烈展开  市府已贷小米三百余万斤

　　北京郊区土地改革后
    大生产运动热烈展开
    市府已贷小米三百余万斤
    【新华社十一日讯】北京市郊区经土地改革后，翻身农民生产情绪普遍高涨。他们在北京市人民政府的大力帮助下，正热情地致力于生产发家，首先是争取达到今年增产一成的农业生产计划。
    北京市郊区耕地共约一百零九万七千多亩，其中种冬麦三十多万亩。今年三月，当郊区土地改革在大部农村中完成后，郊区农民在政府领导下，积极进行积肥、耙地、送粪等春耕准备工作。许多翻身农民天不明就拾粪，并踊跃进城拉运市街区修整下水道和掏北、中、南三海所挖出来的淤泥，以增施土地肥料。加以市人民政府今年贷放了价值一百八十五万五千多斤小米的肥料贷款，帮助农民购买肥料，使今年郊区农田施肥普遍超过去年一倍。
    今年春耕中郊区农民对耕作法的改进很热心。四月初起他们就加紧耕作，使今年播种的秋田大部分都犁过两遍。现除少数低洼地外，大秋作物的播种已告完成。播种中，部分农民并采用了华北农业科学研究所培植的“华农一号谷”等优良作物的种子。为了防止水、旱灾害和改进灌溉，他们在春耕中还积极修渠、整理旧井、凿新井、疏浚河道和开挖排水沟。截至目前为止，京郊今春计划的排水工程已全部完成，疏浚河道和开凿水渠的工程也将近结束。这些工程全部完成后，不仅可使十二万亩良田免遭水患，而且可使一万九千亩旱地得到灌溉。今年四月，郊区有六千多亩小麦发现麦叶蜂为害，一万三千多农民立即在政府领导下起来捕打，半个月内即予扑灭。
    北京市人民政府大力扶持了这一生产运动。今年，市府预算贷予市郊农民发展生产的农贷，包括农具、耕畜、肥料、水车水井、种子等各种贷款为小米四百五十万斤，现已贷出三百六十九万余斤。这些贷款对解决农民生产中的各种困难帮助很大。市府并曾于三月间为郊区农民进行了一次牲畜的春季防疫注射，共注射了马、骡、驴、牛、骆驼共二万四千多头（占全郊区牲畜的百分之八十以上）。最近，市府又开始贷放新式水车七百余辆。这种新式水车较旧式水车轻便，价格则较旧式水车低廉一半，为郊区农民所乐用。
