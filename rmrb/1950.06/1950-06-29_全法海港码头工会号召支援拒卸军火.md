　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 26th (Tass dispatch): The congress of the National Federation of Harbor Workers and Dock Workers' Unions, belonging to the French General Confederation of Labor, has concluded here.

　　The congress unanimously passed a resolution praising the actions of dock workers and working people in other related industries aimed at "opposing the vile war in Indochina and opposing the unloading of American munitions equipment." It believes that the actions of dock workers should receive the practical support of labor unions in all ports and the entire people.

　　The resolution "urges the working people of all ports to down tools and hold demonstrations whenever dock workers refuse to load and unload munitions and military equipment."

　　The resolution concludes by urging the working people of all ports to expand the movement to collect signatures on the Stockholm Appeal demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, and to establish peace committees in all ports.
