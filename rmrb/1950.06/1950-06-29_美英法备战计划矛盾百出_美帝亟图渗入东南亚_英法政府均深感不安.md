Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 27th: TASS Rome, June 26th: The "National Evening News" here published a dispatch from Paris stating: According to information obtained from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during the Three Foreign Ministers' meeting in London, Acheson and Bevin, following the advice of their respective chiefs of staff, decided that once the North Atlantic Group launched a war against the Eastern European countries, France and West Germany should supply the North Atlantic Group with infantry.

To achieve this goal, the United States and Britain will do everything possible to increase the land forces of the continent, regardless of how much economic burden this plan will place on the countries concerned. However, France has no intention of bearing the brunt of a possible war.

It is also learned that representatives from the United States, Britain, France, and other countries met in Paris to discuss the establishment of an "Eastern Affairs Research Center." The task of this research center is to guide activities against the national liberation movements in Southeast Asian countries.

Well-informed sources in London believe that the initiative to establish this research center was proposed by the United States; the United States plans to use it to advance its own purposes, turning this research center into a command post for implementing colonial policies; attempting, under the pretext of helping Southeast Asian countries resist national liberation movements, to infiltrate its own forces into Southeast Asian countries, primarily the territories of Britain and France.

Although in fact British representatives are also participating in the work of this center, people in London political circles are deeply disturbed by this trend of the United States taking advantage of the situation, because this is clearly acting against British interests in India, Pakistan, Burma, Malaya, and other territories.

　　美英法备战计划矛盾百出
    美帝亟图渗入东南亚  英法政府均深感不安
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社罗马二十六日讯：此间“国家晚报”刊载巴黎消息称：据自法国外交部方面获息，伦敦三外长会议期间，艾奇逊与贝文二人曾按照双方参谋总长的建议，决定一旦北大西洋集团对东欧各国发动战争时，法国及西德应供给北大西洋集团以步兵。
    为达到此目的，美英两国将竭尽一切可能扩增大陆的陆军兵员，而不顾这一计划将使有关各国增加多么大的经济负担。但是法国却无意在可能发生的战争中，承受主要的打击。
    同时又悉：美、英、法及其他各国代表曾在巴黎开会，讨论成立“东方事务研究中心”的问题。这一研究中心的任务，是指导反对东南亚各国民族解放运动的活动。
    伦敦方面消息灵通人士认为：成立这一研究中心的倡议，是由美国提出的；美国计划用它来推进自己的目的，把这一个研究中心变为执行殖民政策的司令部；企图在援助东南亚国家抵制民族解放运动的口实下，把自己的势力渗入东南亚各国，首先是英法两国的领地里去。
    虽然事实上英国代表也正在参与着这一个中心的工作，伦敦政界方面人士却对美国这种趁火打劫的趋势深感不安，因为这明明是和英国在印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、马来亚及其他领地内的利益作对的。
