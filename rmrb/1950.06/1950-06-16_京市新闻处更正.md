　　Beijing News Office Correction
    In the report issued by this office on June 3rd regarding the closing of the Beijing Sixth District People's Representative Conference, the phrase "Tax Bureau Fourth Branch Chief Li Ren reported at the meeting" was a mistake and should have read Tax Bureau Sixth Branch. (See page 1 of this newspaper on the 5th.)
    Also: In yesterday's report "Explosion at Fuhua Fireworks Factory," the Fuhua Fireworks Factory is located at 117 Chaoyangmenwai Street, not 177. This correction is hereby made. (See page of this newspaper on the 15th.)
