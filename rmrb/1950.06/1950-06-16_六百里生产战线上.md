On the Six Hundred Li Production Front
    Collective research by Xu Decao, Qi Yuanwo, Wang Songling, Qi Lu, and Sun Tie, written by Shen Shu

    (I) Collective Pioneers and Builders

    From Chadong to Yanbei, the labor songs of tens of thousands of collective pioneers resound across the vast fields of six hundred li. Our entire command and fighters of a certain army of the People's Liberation Army stationed in this area have been carrying out various production activities for the construction of the motherland with a fighting attitude, enthusiasm, and tension since mid-March: land reclamation, road construction, canal digging, mine repair, etc. In two and a half months, more than 31,000 mu of wasteland have been turned into arable land. Among them, nearly 8,000 mu can be used as vegetable gardens, and 6,000 mu have been transformed from mud ponds covered with reeds and cattails or alkali flats into paddy fields. The endless, crisscrossing ridges and neatly arranged rice paddies exude the smell of fresh soil, and the green seedlings are thriving. In Yanbei and Chanan, the battle to conquer the Sanggan River and the Yongding River is being carried out intensely. The huge water canal project, running through the saline-alkali wilderness of Shanyin and Yingxian for thousands of hectares, with a total length of 300 li, is nearing completion (while also completing a highway of the same length as the canal). The siltation and irrigation project of the Sanggan River will add 500,000 mu of fertile paddy fields to our country next year; this year, 150,000 mu have been sown. In the upper reaches of the Yongding River in Chanan, the transportation line needed for the Guanting Reservoir project is also being opened up from the steep mountains. This is the beginning of a major facility that will free more than 10 million people in Chanan, Jibei, and Rehexi from river disasters and obtain agricultural reclamation benefits. On the Pangjiabao mine, thousands of laborers are engaged in the intense work of various civil construction projects. All these different production activities are aimed at a common goal: to fight for overcoming the backwardness and poverty of the motherland and for opening up a prosperous and happy life. In terms of the actual welfare of our troops themselves, the total net profit from the army's production this year is estimated to be 12 million jin of millet; eight to ten months of vegetables can be completely self-sufficient.

    (II) Heroic Deeds and Heroic Actions

    As early as the cold winter, when Chairman Mao's order for the army to participate in production was issued, we were already carrying out various preparations in the midst of intense training. The entire army unanimously proposed: "Guarantee to win a great victory on the production front, and do all preparatory work as if performing combat missions." After the higher-ups deployed and mobilized, enthusiastic actions unfolded from every company. In order not to delay daytime training and study, the soldiers automatically got up early to collect manure for fertilizer; ran 30 to 40 li away, climbed snow-covered mountain peaks to cut timber for tools, regardless of hunger and cold, striving to exceed the tasks required by the higher authorities. Many soldiers did not rest on Sundays, busy weaving baskets, mending shoes, repairing wooden handles, etc. They did everything themselves; if they didn't know how, they learned. Under the leadership of party members and activists, a few comrades who lacked labor experience and were afraid of hardship were also swept into the mass production preparation upsurge. Many squads and platoons accumulated more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer in one winter, and many comrades learned various skills such as weaving baskets and making farm tools. The technology and production efficiency of the newly opened iron and wood factories are rising linearly. The "labor mutual aid" movement spontaneously expanded from individuals to groups to squads and platoons. Tian Fuxiang, a soldier of the reconnaissance company of a certain division (party group leader), initiated the signing of a "mutual aid contract" in the entire squad, which motivated three comrades in the squad who had never had the habit of labor to ask the superiors to participate in making strips for weaving baskets. Wang Yongfu, the squad leader who had been a soldier in the old army for more than ten years and was most afraid of labor, also actively took action. On this "mutual aid contract," according to each person's strengths or weaknesses (amount of labor experience, physical strength, cultural level, etc.), it was specifically written what you teach me and what I help you with, and things were done according to the contract, which increased everyone's confidence in production. Zhang Zhongyun, a soldier from a wealthy family, said confidently after signing the contract: "Everyone is human! If we learn to work, we will slowly improve with help." Whether it is combat, marching, training, study, or completing various tasks, mutual aid and friendship are always a driving force for progress.
   
    In early March, the troops entered the production front with high morale on the basis of fully prepared materials. The expeditionary force that went to Yanbei to dig canals completed a 600-li long march along the railway and highway in ten days. The soldiers did not complain about walking, they said: "We are going to produce for the country, and we haven't produced anything yet. If we take the train, how much money will it cost?" Everyone started calculating: how many people, how many train tickets, how many tools and equipment, how much freight, and the total cost would be 400,000 jin of millet. If this expenditure is saved to help disaster victims, it is enough for 10,000 people to eat for a month. So the soldiers themselves came to the conclusion: "This is too uneconomical, it's better to walk!" He Xiufang, a female propagandist of a certain division who had only been in the army for less than three months, persisted in marching without falling behind, encouraged by the army's enthusiasm despite blisters on her feet. After the start of production, in addition to participating in canal digging, assault dances, and performing plays every day, she also squeezed time to fetch water for the landlord's house to fill the tank, without interruption. She regarded helping the masses with work as an important part of her own improvement and striving to become a good soldier of the people. This is the glorious historical tradition of our army. Even in heavy labor, the troops never forgot the masses. During the busy farming season, the agricultural reclamation troops also set aside a certain amount of time to help the local people with spring plowing. After the canal digging troops arrived at the work site, without mentioning rest and preparation, all the officers and soldiers spent three whole days helping the masses with production. The seventh company of a certain regiment carried water, cleared manure, repaired houses, and chopped grass for the villagers every day after returning from digging canals, as if they were contracted workers. The villagers felt that there was nothing to reward them with, so the whole village performed Yangko dances, beat gongs and drums, and sent two red flags. There are many such things, and the People's Liberation Army and the people are like a family everywhere.

    It's not just about helping with labor, the troops take Chairman Mao's instruction "production should not compete with the people for profit" even more seriously. In order to take care of the masses' production, the army's units gave about 2,000 mu of cultivated land to the masses without compensation. The troops digging canals and repairing mines automatically gave the masses about 50,000 workdays. In addition, under the influence of our land reclamation labor, the masses' idea of increasing production and getting rich has been greatly encouraged. The number of mu they reclaimed land just by being motivated exceeded 5,000 mu. This not only enhances the unity and harmony of the military and the people, but also has a profound political significance in educating the masses to develop economic construction. These are all indirect gains from the troops' production enthusiasm.

    (III) Infinite Mass Wisdom

    Our production is not only supported by enthusiasm. It is through the development and improvement of organizational strength in the complex struggle process, and opening the door to the wisdom of the broad masses, that we have initially mastered the key to victory. Our leading comrades understand that they have more ability to learn, organize, and command combat in the past, but today their ability to command production is too little. They use careful research, meticulous planning, inspection, and diligently learning, carefully and cautiously, regardless of all the troubles, to make up for their shortcomings. Li, the political commissar of a certain division, led regimental cadres to survey a large beach pond with a depth of seven or eight feet and an area of more than a thousand mu. After carefully studying the possibility of opening canals for drainage, as well as the soil quality and the number of workers needed, they decided to turn the entire beach pond into paddy fields. This plan was laughed at by the masses in nearby villages at the time, thinking it was completely a dream. An old farmer in his sixties kindly repeatedly advised Political Commissar Li not to be foolish, saying: In the past, the Japanese devils had the same plan, arrested 2,300 laborers, and experts in water conservancy projects commanded them. After more than three months of efforts, they did not succeed. Moreover, today our technical conditions are not as good as the Japanese? But this did not shake Political Commissar Li's determination. He told the old farmer: The strength and wisdom of the People's Liberation Army can conquer any difficulty, and the experience of the Japanese era in the past cannot be compared. But the old farmer was not willing to easily admit defeat before things were confirmed; he and the peasants in nearby villages waited for the opponent's failure. As a result, after 43 days of labor by 250 soldiers, Political Commissar Li completely won. Three main canals with a total length of 3,400 zhang and 1,300 zhang of branch canals were completed, and the water in the beach was completely drained, and nearly 500 mu of paddy fields were dug out. The farmers in nearby villages also competed to participate at this time, and dug out 500 mu separately, a total of 1,000 mu of paddy fields, which had been completely sown before Xiaoman. In this way, the situation changed greatly! The old farmer and the peasants everywhere praised the People's Liberation Army's creative ability, shouting everywhere to "record a great contribution for General Li (that is, the political commissar of a certain division)!" Similar struggles are also being carried out within the troops: Hu Guanmin, a soldier of the fourth company of a certain regiment, after participating in a collective visit to a reservoir, studied how to solve the problem of watering the company's more than two mu of vegetable garden. He surveyed the water source of a small ditch outside the dike of the vegetable garden, measured the water level and the height of the vegetable beds, and believed that it was entirely possible to build a dam to store water, increase the water level, and then draw water to irrigate the garden. He gave this suggestion to the platoon leader, but the platoon leader did not believe it. Hu used his production break time every day to build a dam by himself, stacking stones and carrying soil. After a week of repairs, the dam was washed away by rain, so he mobilized the comrades in the class to help him. After a week of sacrificing rest time by several people, they finally built a water storage dam that was nine feet high, one zhang and five feet wide, and two zhang long. A rainwater channel was also repaired on the right side, and a 380-meter-long canal was dug to lead to the vegetable field. The actual benefit of this project is that the two mu of vegetable gardens, a total of 1,500 small beds, used to require 1,005 loads of water to be carried manually, and eight people needed to carry it for seven days to water them once. Now, the same thing only requires three people to spend two hours. At the same time, the three mu of vegetable gardens of other companies and the ten mu of fruit and vegetable gardens of the common people can also be used. This matter greatly enlightened the leaders of the division and regiment, and immediately called for the promotion of Hu Guanmin's creation, finding water sources to draw water for irrigation, solving the difficulty of water shortage and frequent drought in the local area, and opposing empiricism and conservative thinking. In this way, many units implemented it, and now only a certain regiment has used this method to transform more than 80 mu of dry land into water land.

    The combination of leadership and mass wisdom has become an infinite source of creativity. This argument is particularly obvious on the construction sites of the canal digging troops. Walking to the canal section is like walking into the ocean of wisdom, where there are fresh events everywhere, and the rich creativity of the soldiers and the masses can be seen everywhere. There are complete sets of ditch digging and drainage methods, and a "standard pole" that can simply and accurately measure the slope without pulling ropes and meters to reduce man-hours, and a "three-line" method of soil loading and pushing that saves time and does not delay work (fixed positions for placing baskets, certain distances and angles for soil loading and carrying). As for the position of the legs and the use of arm strength when lifting soil, and the labor allocation method of "two shovels and three frames" to reduce fatigue and increase speed. All new and effective methods are constantly being invented, verified, and promoted, and the vast majority are extracted from the actual labor experience of the soldiers. If you walk to that construction site and talk to the soldiers, they will explain to you how many meters multiplied by how many meters equals how many slopes and how many bottom widths. The order of digging and unloading soil should be what, so that it is not reworked and meets the requirements. Just like a technical expert, he speaks in a well-organized manner. At the conference, a worker-student representative of a certain regiment (selected by the soldiers themselves, a model in various jobs) reported his mutual aid experience, vividly explaining how he installed different amounts of soil according to different personalities and psychology when supplying soil. For example, less for those who are impatient and love to run, more for those who are gentle and strong, more when starting work after breakfast, and less in the afternoon, etc., carefully promoting the spirit of friendship and consideration, and maintaining continuous labor. These methods were greatly admired by the canal management personnel, who believed that "The People's Liberation Army does not do muddled work, they are full of talents!" An engineer said: "I have been an engineer for more than ten years, and I have never seen so many methods like yours, everything works."

    Indeed, "everything works." Our road-building troops are carrying out the task of leveling cliffs and opening roadbeds on the top of steep mountains. In order to avoid casualties and improve work efficiency, the leading comrades called on everyone to use their brains and think of ways. The squad leader led the soldiers to a meeting to study every day, and finally came up with a method of digging ditches, chiseling the bottom, cutting them into large pieces, and pushing the soil down. As a result, the average amount of soil dug by each person per day increased from three and a half cubic meters to eleven and a half cubic meters, and the efficiency increased by three and a half times, which also ensured safety. The labor efficiency of the entire canal digging troops is also increasing steadily. Initially, each person averaged 3.5 cubic meters of soil per day, gradually increasing to 4.5 cubic meters, six cubic meters, and even reaching a record of 7.2 cubic meters. Due to the rapid increase in efficiency, the completion schedule was greatly shortened. In addition to the original earthwork, a certain division also added 30,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and it will be completed half a month earlier than the originally planned date.

    (IV) Healthy and Active Life

    What other forces guarantee this sustained and full labor mood? Let's take a look at the life aspect!

    Whether it is on the canal section, in the farmland, or on the side of the road, every work place is like a field work-study school. During the break time, the club of the canal digging troops is always active: some people are reading newspapers, learning culture, and composing allegro; another group of people are clapping and cheering for their "artists" to sing drums and play acrobatics; propagandists are performing military dances. During the game time after work, baseball, basketball, and volleyball are all on the field, which is very lively. A certain division generally achieves that each battalion holds an entertainment evening once a week, and each company performs a program once a week. Using short forms such as allegro plays and square dances, they sing about the model characters of their company or show the joy of labor. In the evening, the class holds a criticism meeting to evaluate technology, evaluate activity, evaluate creativity, and evaluate learning, and comprehensively and specifically carry out mass commendation or criticism. The company leaders also conduct a daily comment during the roll call after work, and the atmosphere of supporting the soldiers' enterprising spirit and revolutionary sense of honor permeates everywhere.

    The food management is very good. Even in the remote Yanbei area where material conditions are extremely difficult, long-distance purchasing personnel are organized to ensure the supply of vegetables and meat. The third company of a certain regiment achieved four meals a day: soy milk and fried dough sticks for breakfast, dry rice for noon and evening, and porridge for lunch. Each person is guaranteed at least 1.5 liang of meat, 1.2 liang of oil, 1 liang of salt, and one egg every day. In this way, the entire company can save four or five jin of millet every day (the canal digging troops increase half a jin of millet per person per day in addition to the supply standard). Some units added a little saccharin to the boiled water because the local water was salty, fearing that the soldiers would not want to drink it, to ensure sufficient drinking water during labor. The higher authorities are doing their best to find ways to make the soldiers eat enough, have great energy for labor, and have a high mood for learning. In fact, cultural learning has improved more than during training, and generally two or three characters can be learned every day, and even the worst can learn two characters in three days.

    Behind the healthy and active image of the soldiers, the hard work of the leading comrades is condensed. While participating in labor and organizing and mastering labor every day, the cadres devote their energy to the soldiers' thoughts, learning, life, and health. In the command post on the earthen mountain outside Zhangjiakou, in the temporary shelter cave built in the ruins under Taiyuan, in any battle, those faces that forgot the whistling of shells overhead and lacked sleep can be seen on the canal section or under the sesame oil lamp in the rural grass house today. This is also a battle! They have to be responsible for the hundreds of soldiers in their company or the thousands of soldiers in their team, and they have to be responsible for the current work tasks; and this action of being responsible for the soldiers and for the work is all summed up in one point: being responsible for the motherland and for the people, and doing the work well and doing more. They repeatedly and carefully check the plans, tools, seeds, weeding, turning the soil, and labor organization and distribution in agricultural reclamation - holding the rudder tightly for "deep plowing and careful cultivation to ensure the amount of harvest." On the canal section, they check the slope, bottom width, soil removal, labor allocation and use, etc. They correct the shortcomings in time; if there is any place that does not meet the standard, they rework it without any negligence. The company, battalion, and regiment each organized work inspection teams to check section by section every day, report level by level, and request inspection. After such strict inspections, the entire unit has completely achieved engineering standardization. In the beginning, the engineers on the canal section came to inspect the project every day, but now they rarely come or do not come at all. These engineers said: "You are now experts, you are more careful and responsible for your work than we are, we completely believe it." The local people unanimously praised: "The People's Liberation Army is very capable! They win battles in war, and they also win battles in production!"

    Yes, in war, production, and any future work, we will always grasp victory. We can be victorious, to sum it up in a short sentence: it is because we stand on the land of the motherland with the diligence and courage of masters.

　　六百里生产战线上
    徐德操·漆远渥·王松龄·齐鲁·孙铁集体研究，申述执笔
    （一）集体开拓者与建设者
    从察东到雁北，六百里长的广阔原野上，响彻着数以万计的集体开拓者的劳动歌声。我们驻在这个地区的人民解放军某军全体指战员，从三月中旬正式开始，以战斗姿态，热情紧张地进行着建设祖国的各种生产活动：开荒、筑路、挖渠、修矿、……。两个半月中，已将三万一千多亩荒土变成了可耕的熟地。其中近八千亩可作菜园，有六千亩是从长满了芦苇、蒲草的泥塘或一片碱滩改造成的水田。一望无际纵横交错的垅亩和匀整排列着的稻畦，发散着新的泥土气味，绿苗正欣欣向荣地生长起来。在雁北和察南，征服桑干河、永定河的战斗在紧张地进行着。贯穿山阴、应县几千顷盐碱荒野中间，全长三百华里的巨大水渠工程，已接近完成（同时并附带完成了与渠线同样长短的一条公路）。桑干河的淤灌工程，将使我们国家，在明年新添五十万亩肥沃的水田；今年已有十五万亩完成了播种。在察南永定河上游，兴修官厅水库工程所需要的交通线，也正从险峻的山岭上开辟出来了。这是使察南、冀北、热西千余万人民摆脱河水灾害，获得农垦实利的重大设施的开端。在庞家堡矿山上，成千个劳动力，投入了各种土木兴建工程的紧张工作中。所有这些不同的生产活动，都是指向一个总的目标：为战胜祖国的落后贫困和开拓富裕幸福的生活而战斗。即就我们部队本身现实的福利来说，全军本年生产纯益总值，预计可收入小米一千二百万斤；八至十个月的菜蔬可全部自给。
    （二）英雄的行为与英雄的事迹
    还在冰天雪地的严冬，当毛主席的军队参加生产的号令刚发出来，我们就在紧张的练兵中，进行着各种准备工作了。全军上下一致提出：“保证在生产战线上打大胜仗，和执行战斗任务一样，做好一切准备工作。”上级布置动员后，热烈的行动，就从每个连队里开展起来了。战士们为了不误白天的练兵学习，自动的起大早拾粪积肥；跑到三二十里外，爬上积雪的山峰采伐木材做工具。不顾饥饿和寒冷，争取自己的工作成绩超过上级要求的任务。许多战士们星期日也不休息，忙着编筐、补鞋、修木柄等。什么都自己动手干；什么不会，就学什么。在党员和积极分子的带头下。少数缺少劳动经验和怕受苦的同志们，也卷入了群众性的生产准备热潮里边。不少班排一冬天积肥超过万斤之上，好多同志学会了编筐、造农具各种技术。新开办的铁木工厂的技术和生产效率，都是直线的上升着。“劳动互助”运动从个人到小组，到班排，自发的扩展起来。某师侦察连战士（党的小组长）田福祥发起全班订“互助合同”后，带动了班里三个从来没有劳动习惯的同志，他们自己向上级要求参加打条子编筐。连在旧军队当兵十多年最怕劳动的班长王永福，也积极行动起来。这个“互助合同书”上面，根据每个人的特长或弱点（劳动经验多少。体力强弱、文化高低等），具体的一条条写好你教我什么，我帮你什么，按条办事，增加了大家的生产信心。原来富裕家庭出身的战士张忠云，订了合同书后，满怀自信地说：“谁都是人呀！咱学着干活，有人帮着慢慢就锻炼好了。”不管是战斗、行军、练兵、学习以及完成各种任务，互助友爱，总是一种前进的推动力。
    三月初，部队在有充分准备的物质基础上，士气昂扬地开进了生产阵地。到雁北开渠的远征部队，沿着铁路、公路，十天完成了六百里长途行军。战士们对走路并没有怨言，他们说：“咱们这是去给国家生产呀，现在还没生产出什么来，先坐上火车，算算要花多少钱哩？”大家算起账来了：多少人，打多少张车票，多少工具、器材，要花多少运费，总共算起来需要四十万斤小米。如果把这笔开支节省下来救济灾民，足够一万人吃一个月的口粮。于是战士们自己做出了结论：“这太不合算了，还是走着好！”某师一个参军才不到三个月的女宣传员何秀芳，在部队这种热情鼓舞中，带着两脚泡坚持行军没掉过队。生产开始后，她每天除了参加挖渠、突击舞蹈和演剧外，还要挤时间给房东挑水满缸，从未间断。她把帮助群众做工，列为自己锻炼进步，争取当一名人民好战士的重要的一条。这是我们部队的光荣历史传统。即使在繁重的劳动中，部队也从未忘过群众。农垦部队在农忙时期还要抽出一定时间，帮助驻地群众春耕。挖渠部队开到工作地后，先不讲休息准备，全体指战员用三个整天帮助群众生产。某团七连每天挖渠回来，给全村老乡担水、出粪、修房、铡草，好像包了工一样。老乡觉得没有什么东西酬劳，全村扭秧歌敲锣打鼓，送来两面红旗。这类事情多得很，解放军和老百姓到处都像一家人一样。
    还不止于帮助劳动，部队对毛主席指示：“生产不与民争利”更做得认真。为了照顾群众生产，全军各单位曾无代价让给群众约两千亩开好了的土地。挖渠修矿的部队，自动让给群众约五万多个工。另外，在我们开荒劳动的影响下，大大鼓舞了群众添产致富的思想。仅带动他们开荒的数字就超过了五千亩以上。不只增进了军民关系的团结融洽，而且具有教育群众开展经济建设的深远政治意义。这些都是部队生产热情的间接收获。
    （三）无穷的群众智慧
    我们的生产，也并不是单靠热情支持着的。而是从复杂斗争过程中，发展并健全了组织力量，打开了广大群众智慧的大门，才使我们初步的掌握了胜利的锁钥。我们的领导同志们懂得自己过去学习组织和指挥战斗的本事多一些，而今天指挥生产的本事却太少了。他们就用精心钻研，周密计划、检查，虚心学习，谨慎小心，不顾一切烦劳，来弥补自己的缺点。某师李政委，带着团干部勘查一个方圆千余亩，深达七八尺的大滩池，他们仔细研究了开渠排水的可能及土质、需要工数后，决定动手把这片滩池全部变成水田。这个计划当时成为附近村庄群众的笑料，认为完全是梦想。一个六十多岁的老农民善意地一再劝阻李政委不要傻干，说：当初日本鬼子曾为这同样计划，抓夫两千三百名，还有水利工程专家指挥，经过三个多月的努力都没有成功，何况今天我们技术条件又比不上日本？但这些并未动摇李政委的决心。他告诉这位老农民：解放军的力量和智慧能够征服任何困难，不能拿过去日本时代的经验来比。但这位老农民却并不肯在事情未证实之前，轻易服输；他同近村农民群众一起，等待着对手的失败。结果，是经过二百五十个战士四十三天的劳动后，李政委完全取得了胜利。全长三千四百丈的三条干渠和一千三百丈的支渠完成了，把滩里的水完全排了出去，挖出了近五百亩的水田。附近村庄的农民群众这时也争着参加，又分别挖出五百亩，共计一千亩水田，已在小满前全部播种完毕。这样一来，情况就大变了！那位老农民和农民群众到处夸称着解放军的创造本领，到处嚷着要“给李将军（即某师政委）记一大功！”同样的斗争在部队内部也进行着：某团四连战士胡贯民，参加集体参观某水库后，就研究着怎样解决连里二亩多菜园子的浇水问题。他勘查了菜园堤外低处一条小水沟的水源，测量水位及菜畦高低，认为完全可以做到筑堤储水，把水位增高了，就可以引水浇园。他把这个意见提给排长，排长不肯相信。胡就利用每天生产休息时间，自己动手叠石挑土修筑堤坝。修了一个星期后，堤被雨水冲毁，他就动员班里的同志们帮着做。这样经过几个人的一星期牺牲休息时间的劳动，终于筑成一个九尺高、一丈五尺宽、两丈长的储水堤坝，右侧还修好一条防雨的水道，另挖出一条三百八十公尺长的水渠，引向菜地。这个工程所得实利是：二亩多菜园共一千五百个小畦，从前人工挑水共需一千零五担，八个人挑七天才能浇一次，现在呢，同样的事情，就只需三个人花费两个钟头的时间。同时，其他连队的三亩菜园，老百姓的十亩果菜园也可以利用上。这件事，大大启示了师团领导同志，立即号召推广胡贯民的创造，找水源引水浇地，解决当地水少常旱的困难，反对经验主义和保守思想。这样一来，许多单位都实行起来，现在仅某团就用这个方法，把八十多亩旱地，改造成水地。
    领导力量与群众智慧相结合，就成了无限的创造源泉。这个论据，在挖渠部队的工段上，表现得特别明显突出。走到渠段上，就如同走进智慧的海洋里，随处都有新鲜事件，随处都可以见到战士群众丰富创造力的表现。那里有整套的挖沟排水方法，有不用拉绳和米突尺就可以简单准确的量好坡度减少工时的“标准竿”，有“三线式”的既节省时间，又不误工的装土推土法（放筐有一定位置、装土及挑土人各有一定距离米数和角度）。以至于扬土时腿的位置臂力使用的要领，“两锨三副筐”减少疲劳增加速率的劳动配备法等。所有新的有效的办法，总在不断地发明、证实、推广着，绝大多数是战士们从自己实际劳动体验中提炼出来的。随便走到那个工段上找战士们谈起来，他们就会给你讲解多少米乘多少米，等于多少坡度、多少底宽，挖土出土的顺序应该怎样，才不反工又合乎要领。俨然是一位技术专家的样子，讲的满有条理。某团一位工学代表（战士们自己选出来的，各种工作中的模范人物），在大会上报告他的互助经验，生动的解说着他在供土时怎样根据不同的性格和心理，装不同数量的土。如性急爱跑的少装，性柔体强的多装，早饭后开始工作时多装，下午少装等等，处处细致地发挥着友爱体贴的精神，又保持了持续的劳动力。这些办法使得渠工管理人员大为赞叹，认为：“解放军不干糊涂活，满是人才！”一位工程师说：“我当过十几年的工程师，从没见过像你们这么多的办法，到处都做得通。”
    的确是“到处都做得通”。我们修公路的部队，在险峻的山顶上，执行削平峭壁开辟路基的任务。为了避免伤亡，提高工作效率，领导同志号召大家开动脑筋想办法。班长每天领着战士们开会研究，终于想出一个挖沟凿底切成大块向下推土的办法。结果从每人每天平均挖三方半土，一跃而上升到十一方半，效率提高了三倍半，又保证了安全。整个挖渠部队的劳动效率，也在节节提高，最初每人每天平均挖土三方半，逐渐到四方半、六方，直达到七·二方的纪录。由于效率提高的快，大大缩短了完工日程。某师除原有土方外，又新增加三万土方，还要比原预计完工的日期提前半个月。
    （四）健康活跃的生活
    还有什么力量保证着这种持续饱满的劳动情绪呢？我们再从生活方面看一看吧！
    无论是渠段上，农田里或公路边，各个劳动场所，都好像是野外的工读学校。在休息时间里，挖渠部队的俱乐部总是活跃着：有的人在读报，学文化，编快板；另一部分人在拍手欢呼他们的“艺术家”唱大鼓，玩杂耍；宣传员们在表演军事舞蹈。收工后的游戏时间里，棒球、篮球、排球都上场了，非常热闹。某师普遍做到以营为单位每周开一次娱乐晚会，连为单位每周演出一个节目。以快板剧，广场舞等短小形式，歌唱着自己连队的模范人物，或表现劳动的愉快。晚上，班里开批评会，评技术，评积极，评创造，评学习，全面而又具体地进行群众性的表扬或批评。连的领导也在收工点名时进行一天的讲评，到处弥漫着扶植战士们的上进心和革命的荣誉心的空气。
    伙食管理的很好，即在物资条件极感困难的偏僻的雁北地区，也组织了远路采购人员，保证解决菜疏和肉类的供应问题。某团三连做到每天四餐：早饭豆浆、油条，傍午和晚上干饭，过午一顿稀饭。每天每人保证最少一两五钱肉，一两二钱油，一两盐，一个鸡蛋。这样全连每天还可节余小米四、五斤（挖渠部队除按供给标准外每人每天增加小米半斤）。有些单位因当地水咸，怕战士不愿喝，在开水里加少许糖精，保证劳动中饮水充足。上级总在尽心竭力的想办法使战士们吃的饱，劳动劲头大，学习情绪高。事实上文化学习成绩确比练兵时期提高了，一般的是每天可学会两三个字，最差的也能做到三天学会两个字。
    在战士们这种健康活跃的生活形象后面，都凝结着领导同志的心血。干部们每天在参加劳动与组织掌握劳动的同时，更为战士们的思想、学习、生活、健康而倾注着精力。在张家口外围土山的指挥所里，在太原城下废墟中临时搭就的掩蔽洞里，在任何一次战斗中，你所看到的那些忘掉了头上炮弹呼啸睡眠不足的面孔，今天在渠段上或乡村草屋的麻油灯下，同样可以看得到。这也是在进行着战斗啊！他们要为自己连队百十个或自己团队几千个战士负责，要为当前的工作任务负责；而这为战士、为工作负责的行动，又都归结在一点上：为祖国、为人民负责，要把工作做得好、做得多。他们在农垦中反复细致地检查着计划、工具、籽种、除草、翻地、劳动力组织的分配等——为着“深耕细作保证收获量”而紧握着舵盘。在渠段上则是检查着坡度、底宽、除土、劳动力配备使用等。发现缺点及时纠正；凡是有一点不合乎标准的地方，就丝毫不苟地反工重来。连、营、团，各级分别组织了验工组，每天逐段检查、逐级上报，请示点验。经过这样多次严格的检查，整个部队完全做到了工程标准化。开头，渠段上工程师们还每天来检查工程，现在却很少来或完全不来了。这些工程师们说：“你们现在是行家了，你们自己对工作比我们还精心负责，我们完全相信。”当地老乡一致称赞：“解放军本事强着哩！战争打胜仗，生产也打胜仗！”
    是的，在战争、生产和在未来的任何工作上，我们都将永远把握着胜利。我们所以能够胜利，用一句简短的话来做总结：就是因为我们以主人翁的勤劳和勇敢，站在祖国的土地上。
