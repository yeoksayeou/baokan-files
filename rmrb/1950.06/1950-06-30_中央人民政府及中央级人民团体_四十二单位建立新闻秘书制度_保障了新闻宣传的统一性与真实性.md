[Beijing News] Since the promulgation of the "Provisional Measures for the Unified Release of News" by the Government Administration Council, various departments of the Central People's Government and central-level people's organizations have successively established a news secretary system, now reaching forty-two units. Important government documents such as laws, announcements, directives, and decisions can be promptly submitted to the Xinhua News Agency for unified publication through the news secretaries, ensuring the uniformity and authenticity of news propaganda. According to Xinhua News Agency statistics, in March, 113稿件 (gaojian, manuscripts/articles) came from news secretaries, with an adoption rate of approximately 65 percent; in April, the number of 稿件 increased to 141, and the adoption rate also rose to 78 percent. In addition, news secretaries directly submit 稿件 to various newspapers in the capital, helping reporters in the capital understand the situation and organize 稿件. All of this has gradually improved the quality and quantity of reports on the actual work of various departments.

　　After half a year of efforts, the work of the news secretaries has yielded two points of experience: First, news secretaries must be full-time. According to the experiences of the Financial and Economic Committee and the All-China Women's Federation, full-time news secretaries, under the leadership and assistance of their leaders, can promptly select materials, organize 稿件, and send them to the Xinhua News Agency for unified release, or directly to various newspapers for selection and publication, with good results. However, in some units, the news secretaries are concurrently held by cadres with more important responsibilities. Due to busy administrative work, the 稿件 issued are mostly announcements, lacking national comprehensive reports, and even failing to promptly issue news that should be released. Second, holding press conferences or symposiums in a planned manner is a good organizational form for uniting and improving reporters and concentrating the use of reporter resources. For example, the Ministry of Internal Affairs now holds a press conference every weekend convened by the news secretary. The central content of the meeting is determined by the minister before the meeting according to needs, and relevant responsible personnel are designated to speak, and their speaking outlines are reviewed in advance. Because the meeting is prepared and the content is practical, the number of participating reporters has gradually increased, and news reports related to the work of the department have also increased significantly.

　　Currently, the central government agencies and organizations are further improving the work of news secretaries based on these two experiences to strengthen reports on actual work.

### 中央人民政府及中央级人民团体  四十二单位建立新闻秘书制度  保障了新闻宣传的统一性与真实性

　　中央人民政府及中央级人民团体
    四十二单位建立新闻秘书制度
    保障了新闻宣传的统一性与真实性
    【本市讯】自政务院统一发布新闻暂行办法公布后，中央人民政府各部门和中央级人民团体先后建立新闻秘书制度，到现在已达四十二个单位。重要的政府文件如法令、公告、指示、决定等，都能经由新闻秘书及时交新华社统一发表，保障了新闻宣传上的统一性和真实性。根据新华社统计，三月份来自新闻秘书的稿件为一一三件，采用率约百分之六十五，四月份稿件增为一四一件，采用率也提高到百分之七十八。此外，新闻秘书并向首都各报直接投寄稿件，帮助首都记者了解情况、组织稿件，所有这些，使各部门实际工作报导在质和量方面都已逐步提高。
    经过半年来的努力，新闻秘书的工作已取得了两点经验：第一，新闻秘书必须专任，据财委和全国妇联等处的经验，专任新闻秘书在首长的领导和帮助之下，可以及时选择材料、组织稿件，按性质分别送新华社统一发布，或径送各报社选载，效果很好。而有些单位则因新闻秘书由负有较重要责任的干部兼任，由于行政工作繁忙，所发稿件多为公告性质，缺少全国性的综合报导，甚至使应发布的新闻未能及时发出。第二，有计划地举行记者招待会或座谈会，是团结和提高记者，集中使用记者力量的较好的组织形式，例如内务部现每周末由新闻秘书召集一次记者招待会，会议中心内容由部长于会前根据需要决定，指定有关的负责人员发言，并事先审阅其发言提纲，由于会议有准备，内容切实，与会记者逐次渐多，有关该部工作的新闻报导也显著增加。
    现在，中央各机关团体正根据这两项经验，进一步改进新闻秘书的工作，以加强实际工作的报导。
