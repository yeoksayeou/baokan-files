　　Hebei Takes Serious Measures to Manage Local Salt
    Sea Salt Sales Increase Significantly
    Local Salt Producers Stop Leaching and Change Professions
    [Our Correspondent in Baoding] Since the Central People's Government instructed Hebei Province to manage local salt in mid-April, local salt production has gradually decreased, and sea salt sales have increased. In addition to the five special districts of Handan, Xingtai, Hengshui, Cangxian, and Tangshan, which are directly managed by the Changlu Salt Administration Bureau through the establishment of three offices in Xinghan, Hancang, and Tangshan (the Tangshan office was established earlier), with salt affairs offices set up in key areas for management, other regions are managed by local tax authorities, which also collect local salt taxes on behalf of the government. All regions began publicizing, registering, and managing salt affairs successively in early and mid-May. Since January, many salt farmers have already changed professions or are contemplating doing so. All salt producers in the fifth district of Handan have stopped leaching and are preparing to switch to agricultural production. In the Baoding municipal district, there were a total of five salt leaching households, of which three have switched professions, and the remaining two are also preparing to do so. Generally, local salt has greatly decreased or completely disappeared from markets, so sea salt sales have increased significantly. The Hengshui Salt Company sold 116,368 catties of sea salt in April, and 283,766 catties in May, an increase of nearly one and a half times. Xingtai Town sold 3,786 catties of sea salt in early May, which increased to 53,192 catties in late May, an increase of more than thirteen times, and it is still increasing daily. The number of sea salt vendors has also increased from the original three to twenty-six, and many continue to apply for business licenses. Sea salt sales have also increased in other regions.
    Although local salt has mostly disappeared from the market, some has gone underground, changing to night-time trafficking or mixing local salt into sea salt, or openly selling sea salt but secretly selling local salt, as well as using taxed local salt to cover up the sale of untaxed smuggled salt. These phenomena should be noted and corrected.

　　河北各地认真管理土盐
    海盐销量显著增加         
    各地土盐户纷纷停淋转业
    【本报保定讯】河北省自四月中旬奉中央人民政府指示对土盐进行管理以来，各地土盐已渐减少，海盐销量增加。该省除邯郸、邢台、衡水、沧县、唐山五个专区由长芦盐务局直接设邢邯、衡沧、唐山三办事处（唐山办事处早已建立），并重点设盐务所管理外，其他地区均由各级税务机关进行管理，并代征土盐税。各地均先后于五月上、中旬开始宣传登记与管理。一月以来，不少产品盐民均已转业或正酝酿转业。邯郸五区盐户已全部停淋，准备转入农业生产。保定市辖区共有五户淋盐，现有三户转业，共余二户也准备转业。一般集市土盐已大见减少，有的已完全绝迹，故海盐销量已显著增加。衡水盐业公司四月份销海盐一一六、三六八斤，五月份即销到二八三、七六六斤，增加了将近一倍半。邢台镇五月上旬销海盐三、七八六斤，下旬即增至五三、一九二斤，增加了十三倍以上，现仍日有增加。海盐商贩也由原来三户增至二十六户，继续申请经营者仍不少。其他地区海盐销量亦均增多。
    目前土盐虽已大多在市场绝迹，但有的却走向暗流，改由夜间贩运或在海盐内掺上土盐，或明卖海盐，暗卖土盐，以及用已税土盐掩护未税私盐出售等现象。这些均应引起注意和加以纠正。
