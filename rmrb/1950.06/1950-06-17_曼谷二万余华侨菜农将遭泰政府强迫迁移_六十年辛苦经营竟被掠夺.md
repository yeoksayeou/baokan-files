Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to delayed news from Bangkok: The persecution of overseas Chinese vegetable farmers in the suburbs of Bangkok by the reactionary Thai authorities is intensifying. In the autumn of last year, the bureaucratic capitalist group of the fascist Luang Phibuns ordered the relocation of over 20,000 overseas Chinese vegetable farmers (including some poor Thai farmers) in the Khlong Toei area in the northeastern suburbs of Bangkok under the pretext of establishing a state-run tobacco factory. In late April of this year, the Thai authorities dispatched armed police to force each household of the Khlong Toei vegetable farmers to affix their fingerprints to pre-printed relocation agreements, threatening that they must relocate within the shortest possible period, otherwise they would be "prosecuted." Representatives of the Khlong Toei vegetable farmers have appealed to the Chinese and Thai press in Bangkok for support, demanding that the authorities withdraw the order.

Khlong Toei was originally a wilderness of weeds and thorny bushes. It is only after more than sixty years of hard work by the overseas Chinese that the basis for today's livelihood has been established. The more than 20,000 vegetable farmers own a total of thousands of mu of vegetable gardens and hundreds of fish ponds.

　　曼谷二万余华侨菜农将遭泰政府强迫迁移
    六十年辛苦经营竟被掠夺
    【新华社十六日讯】据曼谷迟到消息：泰国反动当局对曼谷市郊华侨菜农的迫害，日益紧逼。去年秋季，銮披汶法西斯的官僚资本集团，即以筹建国营烟草工厂为名，下令曼谷东北郊孔堤地区的二万余华侨菜园农民（其中并有泰国贫苦农民若干）迁移。今年四月下旬，泰国当局出动武装警察，强迫孔堤菜农各住户，在其预先印好的迁移字约上按手印，并威逼须于最短期间内搬迁，否则将被“控告”。孔堤菜农代表曾吁请曼谷中泰报界，予以声援，要求当局收回成命。
    按孔堤本属野草丛生、荆棘纵横的荒野，经华侨六十余年来之惨淡经营，始有今日的生活基础。二万余菜农共有菜园千亩，鱼池百口。
