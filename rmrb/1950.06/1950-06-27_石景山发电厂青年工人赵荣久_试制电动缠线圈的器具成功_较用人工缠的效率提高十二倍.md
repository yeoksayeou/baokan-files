Shijingshan Power Plant Youth Worker Zhao Rongjiu
Successfully Trial-Produces Electric Coil Winding Device
Increasing Efficiency Twelvefold Compared to Manual Winding

[Our Newspaper News] Zhao Rongjiu, a young worker in the electrical workshop of Shijingshan Power Plant, invented an electric coil winding device. Preliminary test results show that its efficiency is twelve times higher than manual coil winding. In the past, the electrical workshop of the plant wound coils entirely by hand. It took two workers two hours to wind a 300-turn coil, and the tightness was uneven, the surface was not smooth, and sweat easily corroded the wires. In June, the plant signed a collective contract, and the trade union called for creating new records. Zhao Rongjiu consulted with veteran workers and planned to use a machine to wind coils. At this time, they were working on the electrical part of the No. 5 machine's circulating water pump. The veteran worker took over the remaining work, allowing Zhao Rongjiu to focus on research. Zhao Rongjiu saw that the lathe rotated very quickly, so he wanted to manufacture a device to install on the lathe and use the lathe's rotation to wind coils. He ran to the lathe and consulted with veteran technicians in the production technology section, learned about the lathe's rotation in detail, and then combined it with his past experience of winding coils by hand, finally figuring out a set of devices. However, after the initial trial, it was found that many parts were not suitable. He continued to research with the help of veteran technicians, replacing the wooden core with an iron core and enlarging the "cone." After this step-by-step improvement, he finally succeeded. The current test results show that it only takes one person twenty minutes to wind a coil. If the technique is skilled, the efficiency can be further improved.

　　石景山发电厂青年工人赵荣久
    试制电动缠线圈的器具成功
    较用人工缠的效率提高十二倍
    【本报讯】石景山发电厂电气场青年工人赵荣久发明用电动缠线圈的器具，经初步试验结果，比以前用人工缠线圈效率提高十二倍。该厂电气场过去缠线圈完全是用手缠，两个工人缠一个三百圈的线圈需要二小时，而且松紧不一，表面不平，汗水又易腐蚀电线。六月份该厂签订集体合同，工会号召创造新纪录。赵荣久与老师父商量，计划用机器缠线圈，这时他们正做五号机循环水泵上电气部分的活，老师父就把这件工作的尾活接下来，让赵荣久用心研究。赵荣久看到旋床转动速度很快，就想制造一件器具按装在旋床上，利用旋床的转动缠线圈。他跑到旋床旁向生产技术科老技工请教，详细了解床子转动情况，再与过去用手缠线圈的经验相溶合，终于琢磨出一套器具。但制造出来经过初步试验后，发现许多处不合用。他又在老技工帮助下继续研究，将木胎换成铁胎，又旋大了“圆椎体”，经过这样一步一步的改进，最后终于成功了。现在试验的结果，一个人缠一个线圈只用二十分钟。如果技术熟练了，效率还能提高。
