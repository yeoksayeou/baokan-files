(From Our Correspondent in Shenyang) The Political Department of the Northeast Military Region of the People's Liberation Army convened a political work conference in May to specifically discuss and resolve the issue of cultural education in the troops in the future. The conference determined that from around September of this year to the end of next year, the entire army will shift to focusing on cultural learning. Of the weekly education time, culture will account for 70.2 percent; military will account for 20.4 percent (only review, no new subjects added); and politics will account for 9.4 percent.

The requirements for soldiers' cultural learning: Troops participating in agricultural production this year should learn 600 to 800 characters per person by the end of the year; other troops must learn 800 to 1,000 characters and the four arithmetic operations. By the autumn of 1952, all soldiers should generally be raised to the level of elementary school graduation. To achieve the above requirements, it was decided to equip each battalion with a central cultural instructor and each company with three cultural instructors, and appropriately solve the issue of cultural textbooks for soldiers.

The requirements for cadres' cultural learning: In the four and a half to five years from September of this year, company and platoon-level cadres should be raised to the level of junior high school graduation; cadres above the battalion level should be raised to the level of senior high school graduation where possible. Cadres in high-level organs and special departments of all troops should mainly adopt the long-term, formal, on-the-job study approach; cultural learning for cadres in troops below the division level will mainly be off-the-job study (rotational training). All cadres working on the job will implement a half-day study system. For the cultural learning of on-the-job cadres, starting around September of this year, each regiment will set up three primary school classes; each division will set up three primary school classes and one first-year junior high school class; each provincial military region will set up three primary school classes and two first and second-year junior high school classes; the Northeast Military Region Headquarters and Political Department will each set up three primary school classes and three junior high school classes. In addition, each division, provincial military region, and the Northeast Military Region will also establish a number of primary and junior/senior high school classes for off-the-job cadres to study culture, with the expectation of rotating the majority of the existing 17,000 cadres below the junior high school level through training in three phases. In this way, most cadres can achieve the required goals through one and a half years of rotational training and three years of on-the-job study. The conference also discussed and resolved issues such as teachers, teaching materials, and funding for cadre cultural schools.

The conference required the leading organs of all troops to not only actively carry out necessary material preparations but also to conduct full ideological mobilization throughout the army so that all officers and soldiers understand the importance of improving culture for building a regularized national defense army; it also required them to conscientiously organize and lead this work, closely integrating it with production, training, work, and political and professional studies, and progressing regularly, systematically, and gradually.

　　争取两年里全军战士达到高小毕业程度
    东北军区订出具体学习办法
    今年九月全军教育转入以文化为主
    师团各级领导机关普遍设文化学校
    【本报沈阳讯】人民解放军东北军区政治部于五月间召开了政治工作会议，专门讨论与解决今后部队的文化教育问题。会议确定从今年九月前后到明年年底止，全军转入以学习文化为主。每周的教育时间，文化占百分之七十点二；军事占百分之二十点四（只进行复习，不增加新课目）；政治占百分之九点四。
    对战士文化学习的要求：今年参加农业生产的部队，到年底每人学会六百至八百字；其他部队须学会八百至一千字和算术的四则题运算法。到一九五二年秋季，所有战士应普遍提高到高小毕业程度。为达到上述要求，决定给各营配齐一名中心文化教员；各连补齐三名文化教员，并适当解决战士的文化课本。
    对干部的文化学习要求：在今年九月以后的四年半至五年中，连排级干部要提高到初中毕业程度；营以上干部要在可能条件下提高到高中毕业程度。各部队的高级机关与特殊部门的干部主要采取长期的正规的在职学习方针；师以下部队的干部文化学习则以离职学习（轮训）为主。所有在职工作的干部均实行半日学习制。对于在职干部的文化学习，从今年九月前后起，每团设完小三个班；各师设完小三个班、初中一年级一个班；每省军区设完小三个班、初中一、二年级两个班；东北军区司令部和政治部各设完小、初中各三个班。另外，各师、省军区和东北军区还要分别设立若干供离职干部学习文化的完小及初高中班次，预计分三期将现有初中程度以下的干部一万七千名大部轮训完毕。这样，大部分干部皆可经一年半轮训和三年在职学习，达到所要求的目标。关于干部文化学校的教员、教材及经费等，会议中也已讨论解决。
    会议要求各部队的领导机关除积极进行必要的物质准备外，还必须在全军中进行充分的思想动员，使全军指战员明了提高文化对于建设正规化国防军的重要性；还必须认真地组织领导这一工作，使其与生产、练兵、工作及政治、业务学习密切结合，正规地、有计划地循序渐进。
