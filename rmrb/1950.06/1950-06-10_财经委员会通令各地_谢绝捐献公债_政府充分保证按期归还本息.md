　　Xinhua News Agency, June 9th—The Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government recently issued a circular instructing local finance committees to politely decline all donations of People's Victory Bonds. During the issuance of the People's Victory Public Bonds, some individuals in certain areas expressed a desire to donate their bonds to the government. The Central Financial and Economic Committee believed at the time that the promotion of the first phase of the People's Victory Discount Public Bonds was nearing completion. These bonds are a form of borrowing from the people by the People's Government during a period of current financial difficulty. The government has full assurance that the principal and interest can be repaid on schedule in the future. The people who subscribe to the bonds should regard these bonds as extremely reliable property. Although the motives of these individuals who donate the bonds are to support the government, if the government accepts them, it may affect the credit of the bonds and cause unnecessary concerns for some people. Therefore, a circular has been issued to all regions to politely decline.

　　财经委员会通令各地
    谢绝捐献公债
    政府充分保证按期归还本息
    【新华社九日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会日前发出通告，指示各地财委，对捐献人民胜利公债者，一律婉言谢绝。在人民胜利公债发行过程中，个别地区即有部分人士愿将公债捐献政府情事。中央财经委员会当时即认为人民胜利折实公债第一期的推销工作已接近完成，此项公债为人民政府在目前财政困难时期，向人民举办的一种借款，政府有充分的保证，将来定可按期归还本息。认购公债的人民，应把此项公债当作极可靠的财产。这些捐献公债人士的动机固然是拥护政府，但如政府予以接受，即可能影响公债的信用，使有些人产生不必要的顾虑，故已通令各地婉谢。
