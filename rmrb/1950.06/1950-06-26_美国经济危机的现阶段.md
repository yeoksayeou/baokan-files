　　The Current Stage of the American Economic Crisis
    By A. Manukyan
    Translated by Sun Rui and Chen Youmin

    The year 1949 marked the beginning of a new economic crisis for the entire capitalist world. In the initial post-war period, the industrial production of major capitalist countries, though growing slowly, generally trended upward. However, by 1949, industrial production began to decline. Concurrent with this decline was the increasing impoverishment of workers, and the widening and deepening gap in living standards between the working masses and a handful of bourgeois parasites.

    In the United States, the leading capitalist nation, industrial production fell by 8.3 percent in one year. The increase in production that the U.S. had achieved in the three years after the war was wiped out, almost reverting to the production level of 1946. However, during the same three-year period, the Soviet Union's industrial output increased by 85 percent.

    However, the decline in U.S. industrial production does not fully reflect the full picture of the development of the American economic crisis. The American reactionaries are pursuing an arms race policy, and a large number of war contracts have inflated arms production. According to estimates by an American economist, Joris Hills, by the end of 1949, 6.5 million people in the United States were directly or indirectly working in factories related to the arms race and war preparations. Regardless of the position of this estimate, it is an open admission that preparations for aggressive war and militarization have become the foundation of the capitalist economy.

    The decline in output in important industrial sectors is above the general level of decline. For example, coal production fell by 27.5 percent in 1949, steel by 12.2 percent, motor trucks by 18 percent, and railway vehicles by 17.8 percent. Cast aluminum production fell by 42.6 percent. Industrial consumption of lead fell by 22 percent. Railway transport volume fell by 15.9 percent. In those industrial sectors where rises and falls can be calculated with specific figures, the decline in production is in fact much greater than can be judged by the general industrial production index. Furthermore, some facts, like the ones below, cannot be reflected by a simple index, such as:

    Total agricultural income fell by 20.3 percent in 1949;

    The number of unemployed, according to greatly underestimated official statistics, increased by 80 percent (1,941,000 at the end of 1948 to 3,489,000 at the end of 1949), not including those partially unemployed;

    Business bankruptcies increased by 75 percent;

    Consumer debt increased by 15.1 percent, etc.

    The following facts should also be added: the volume of industrial and commercial construction in 1949 was 70 or 80 percent of that in 1948, and U.S. coal and automobile exports fell by 36 to 38 percent.

    All the above figures and facts are outside the scope of the industrial production index. However, this is enough to illustrate the development of the agricultural crisis, the increasing impoverishment of farmers and the working class, the bankruptcy of a large number of small businesses, the reduction of investment, and the shrinking of U.S. industrial products in foreign markets.

    It should still be noted that in 1949, many signs of the economic crisis had not fully matured, and their impact had not been fully exerted. However, there is no doubt that American industry and commerce will feel this effect in the near future. For example, although the decline in farmers' income did not affect the production of agricultural machinery in 1949, in the first quarter of the 1950 fiscal year, sales of the largest American agricultural machinery factory (International Harvester Company) decreased by 19 percent compared with the same quarter of the previous year, and another factory (Case Corporation) decreased by 62.3 percent. Tractor production decreased by 25 percent in the first quarter of 1950 compared with the same quarter last year.

    Now, installment payments are the main force stimulating industrial production, but the increase in consumer debt in the following months will inevitably seriously affect retail business.

    At the same time, it is even more noteworthy that the American economic crisis is developing unevenly. Industrial production is affected by many factors, and the curve of industrial output is jagged. In addition, it must be noted that official indexes often have large discrepancies. For example, in order to stabilize people's hearts, the index for October 1949 was hastily "revised."

    Industrial production in July 1949 decreased by 18 percent compared with the level of October 1948, followed by a new decrease in the index in October, a decrease of 22 percent compared with October 1948. After this sharp drop, American industrial production showed an upward trend. The table is as follows:

      U.S. Industrial Production (1935-39=100) Time
              Index 1948.10

            179 1950.2

    Seasonal fluctuations not included

    In the autumn of 1949, when the contraction of business activity was particularly significant, the American newspapers' views on the prospects were very pessimistic. For example, the monopoly capital's organ, "Business Daily," wrote on November 7, 1949:

    "The rebound in production after the strike cannot be considered to have changed the basic situation of the commercial scene."

    But as soon as the production curve rose slightly, the bourgeois economists began to be infinitely optimistic. Even those newspapers that had always affirmed that there was no crisis are now shamelessly declaring that "the crisis has passed." Thus, we have a startling replica of what happened in 1929-30. In February to April 1930, when the industrial production index rose to 12 to 14 percent higher than in December 1929, specialized optimists came out triumphantly claiming that the crisis had passed. But the development of the crisis in 1930 proved how little these economists understood the trend of development. Today, the optimistic assurances made by the American bourgeois newspapers that the United States has passed or is passing through the crisis are typical wishful thinking.

    In fact, in those basic sectors that determine the long-term future of American economic activity, there has been no change in the general conditions of the crisis. Let us list some typical examples.

    In February and March 1950, U.S. exports were 26 percent lower than in the same period in 1949. The amount of investment in the first quarter of this year, calculated for the whole year, is 15.3 billion U.S. dollars. It must be noted that all major companies have announced that their development plans have either been completed or are nearing completion. This leads American economists to expect a further sharp drop of 13 percent in investment in 1950. At the same time, railway companies will reduce investment by 44 percent, mining companies by 17 percent, and electricity companies by 32 percent.

    The current increase in U.S. industrial production is mainly due to temporary reasons, especially in the coal and steel industries. The current output of 13.3 million tons of coal per week is largely due to the need to replenish reserves due to the long-term coal miners' strike. This productivity clearly exceeds the current consumption. As a reader of the Wall Street Journal wrote in a letter, this will cause a large amount of hoarding, which will trigger fierce price struggles in the next two or three months, resulting in the destruction of a large number of small businesses and the closure of a large number of coal mines. Newspaper reports indicate that the decline in coal prices and production has already begun.

    The same scene can be seen in the steel industry. "Moody's Stock Survey" magazine said: "The current activity is partly artificial." It estimates that steel exports and consumption by the railway and shipbuilding industries in 1950 will decrease by 25 to 30 percent, and the needs of the agricultural and automobile industries will decrease by 10 to 15 percent. "The artificial surge in the first few months of this year and the corresponding downturn in the second half of the year" is "Moody's Stock Survey" magazine's prediction of the production situation in 1950.

    American economists are particularly excited about the fact that bus production is maintained at an artificial high level through special measures. The installment payment sales system has reached the breaking point in the automobile sector. Newspapers commented with regret that Charles Riley Company "missed the opportunity" and lost its position in the market due to the strike in its factory from February to April. This eagerness for opportunities that exist today and disappear tomorrow is the general characteristic of the American market situation. And when the American economy is becoming more and more dependent on narcotic stimulation, the particularity of this situation becomes even more serious.

    The production increase in some industrial sectors is fragile and temporary, while the indicators of other economic activities prove the steadfastness of the crisis trend.

    The most typical is the production of trucks, which fell by 18 percent in 1949 and another 11 percent in the first quarter of 1950. New orders for railway cars in 1949 were reduced to a fraction of those in 1948. The number of houses under construction in January and February increased, but the volume of industrial and commercial buildings was 22 percent less than at the beginning of 1949.

    In the development of the economic crisis, purchasing power is declining day by day. A significant sign is that department store retail sales (clothing, shoes, textiles, including food) decreased by 2-7 percent compared with 1949, while 1949 was already lower than 1948.

    American economists use statistics to point out that in January 1950, the purchase of durable goods (such as automobiles, televisions, etc.) has increased to some extent. They are trying to eliminate the impression caused by the shocking figures. But they did not point out where the funds that contributed to the increase in purchasing power came from. The general situation is that durable goods are purchased in installments, which turns consumers into debtors. The installment payment purchase system is boasted as one of the greatest achievements of the United States, because this system can bestow all the happiness of heaven on ordinary people. But this heaven is a "fool's paradise" because as long as the buyer fails to make a payment on time, he will not only have to return what he has bought, but also lose the amount he has already paid.

    Consumer debt increased by nearly 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1949 alone and is continuing to increase. Non-agricultural product mortgage debts have now doubled the total in 1945 and are increasing rapidly.

    The American banking community is also troubled by these facts. On March 28, 1950, new stocks worth 734 million U.S. dollars were still held by the companies that issued the stocks. Because the "public" has no purchase requests.

    One of the very few indicators in commercial activity that continues to show an upward trend is the profits of large monopoly capital. The crisis has painfully attacked workers and small farmers, but it has never affected the interests of large enterprises. According to newspaper reports, cash dividends alone (stock dividends not included) increased from 6.093 billion U.S. dollars in 1948 to 6.495 billion U.S. dollars in 1949.

    Due to rising prices, some industrial sectors whose sales volume decreased in 1949 still increased their profits. For example, the sales volume of U.S. Steel Corporation decreased from 2.481 billion U.S. dollars in 1948 to 2.302 billion U.S. dollars in 1949, but during the same period, its profits increased from 288 million U.S. dollars to 348 million U.S. dollars.

    The exclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises by large monopoly enterprises continued to intensify dramatically in 1949. Under the guise of the so-called "people's capitalism," monopoly capital is merciless to its peers in "private enterprise competition." In 1949 alone, 480,000 American small and medium-sized enterprises closed down in the commercial sector. The dissatisfaction among small businesses is so significant that President Truman recently felt it necessary to supplement his campaign promise program to guarantee the interests of small businesses. But this promise is no more valuable than other lies. At the same time, the total assets of manufacturers with capital less than 5 million U.S. dollars decreased by 1.537 billion U.S. dollars in one year, while manufacturers with capital of 5 million to 100 million U.S. dollars or more increased their capital by 5.0021 billion U.S. dollars. The reason is very clear. Monopoly capital, by intensifying the exploitation of the working class and sacrificing non-monopoly industries and factories, can still maintain its high level of excess profits. The percentage rate of sales can illustrate this point. In the first type of enterprise (referring to those with capital less than 5 million U.S. dollars), this rate increased from 0.1 percent of commerce in 1949 to 5.7 percent, while in the second type of enterprise (referring to those with capital more than 5 million U.S. dollars), it was as high as 12.6 percent.

    Small and medium-sized automobile manufacturers are suffering losses and struggling on the verge of collapse. On the other hand, large monopoly capital such as General Motors Corporation is increasing its profits year after year. The average number of workers' exploitation from this company increased by 6.9 percent in 1949 compared with 1947. During the same period, its total sales increased by 50 percent, and its total profit increased by 101.1 percent. These figures show that General Motors Corporation on average had to exploit 1,585 U.S. dollars from each worker it employed in 1947, 2,295 U.S. dollars in 1948, and 2,990 U.S. dollars in 1949.

    Large monopoly enterprises continue to prosper, but their prosperity comes from the blood and sweat of the working class, who are becoming absolutely and relatively more impoverished. Although the official figures have been systematically tampered with and repeatedly falsified, this fact cannot be concealed. Even according to these figures, it can be explained that although the average weekly income of proletariat employees increased by 19 percent in 1949 compared with 1944, prices increased by 35 percent during the same period.

    The Marshall Plan was originally planned by American monopoly capitalists as a tool to export crises and unemployment to Western European countries. In the first few years after the war, the capitalist countries of Europe repeatedly flaunted their recovery plans and programs, but when the crisis just began to show its ferocity, all these plans and programs were shelved. The French government officially announced its decision to reduce the planned coal production in 1950 from 64.5 million tons to 54 million tons, which is roughly equal to the 1949 production and is 1 million tons less than the 1929 production. For the sake of surplus commodities, coal mines were ordered to suspend work for two days a month. However, it is worth noting that France is still importing American and German coal—this is a "gift" from the Marshall Plan that France does not dare to refuse.

    In the past few months, the gradually increasing crisis in the United States and several capitalist countries in Europe has not caused new reductions in their total industrial production. In its current stage, the crisis is mainly manifested in the increase in debt, the accumulation of surplus goods, and the failure of small business wholesalers. But in addition to this, under some less obvious circumstances, the development of the crisis is inseparable from the sharp increase in unemployment, the deterioration of the working class's living standards, and the development of the agricultural crisis.

    The characteristic of economic activity in capitalist countries is that the number of unemployed is increasing regularly, universally, and rapidly. According to official U.S. figures, the number of people completely unemployed in the United States in February this year was 4,684,000. But in addition, 2,258,000 people were considered to "only have job positions but not be at work," and 8,927,000 people were partially employed and partially unemployed. This autumn, another 1.7 million people will become "job seekers." The opportunities for these millions of job seekers are very slim. The U.S. Department of Labor also admits that the prospect in this regard is extremely bleak: "The employment outlook is the most miserable in a decade."

    The Department of Labor's survey report proves that the areas where unemployment is particularly serious are increasing. More than 20 percent of the working people in Lawrence, Massachusetts, are unemployed. The survey report says that the only jobs that are easy to get are doctors, dentists, and—people who take care of lunatics! The warmongers and instigators of war hysteria can at least boast that they have created job opportunities for these people.

    The current increase in unemployment is even more serious because it is accompanied by only a slight decrease in industrial production, or even no decrease at all.

    According to the published index, in West Germany, the total industrial output in 1949 was higher than in 1948. However, according to official figures, the number of unemployed in December 1948 reached 759,000, which doubled by the end of 1949, and in mid-February this year, the number of unemployed in West Germany reached 2,018,000. This figure does not include the 400,000 unemployed in West Berlin.

    There is only one reason for the huge increase in unemployment in Western Europe, and that is the cruel capitalist "rationalization system," which is inseparable from the development of the economic crisis. And the root of all these evils can be summarized in one term—Marshall Planning. The entire industry in France and Italy has been almost completely excluded, and dozens of state-owned machine manufacturing plants and metallurgical plants have been sold as parts; and in Japan, many coal mines have been closed on the grounds that they are unprofitable. Various industries in West Germany, Scandinavia, and other countries that have been suffocated by American competition have closed down.

    There are no official statistics in any capitalist country that do not indicate that unemployment is increasing sharply. In one year, the number of unemployed in Finland increased by 103.4 percent, the U.S. and British occupied areas of Germany increased by 100 percent, the French occupied areas increased by 375 percent, Switzerland increased by 100 percent, France increased by 56 percent, Canada increased by 54 percent, the Netherlands increased by 52.6 percent, Austria increased by 49.5 percent, Belgium increased by 22 percent, and Norway increased by 21 percent. In Italy, despite the repeated "removal" of unemployed people in official figures, there are still 2 million registered unemployed, not including 250,000 government unemployed employees and 1.5 million temporary agricultural workers.

    A particularly significant sign is the increase in the employment of female and child labor, which is a common phenomenon during the crisis. American "Business Week" claimed that the number of female workers employed in the United States increased by 350,000 in a few months in 1949, while 700,000 male workers lost their jobs during the same period. "Business Week" cleverly explained that this was only to reduce labor costs.

    Another characteristic of the current economic situation in capitalist countries is the continued development of the agricultural crisis, which is not only deeply manifested in the United States, but also spread to other countries under the Marshall Plan. Just like the situation in 1929-33, the current surplus of agricultural products is increasing rapidly. In the United States, precious agricultural products that are urgently needed by the masses are used as feed or simply destroyed.

    In order to save the decline in prices (which is detrimental to monopoly capital and landlords), the U.S. government ordered a 23 percent reduction in cotton fields and planting areas, a 14 percent reduction in wheat fields, a 13 percent reduction in corn fields, and a 20 percent reduction in peanut fields this year. As a result, one of the most terrifying phenomena of all unemployment will appear—rural unemployment, because this unemployment is invisible and unregistered. Millions of tenant farmers in the South will suffer deeply. The mobile and wandering agricultural labor unemployment team is even deprived of their only season's income.

    France recently announced the abolition of sugar rationing, but immediately faced overproduction of sugar beets. The French government has no other countermeasure than to copy the old trick of the United States and reduce the sugar beet planting area by 15 percent. Whenever the consumption of major foods is particularly low, it becomes necessary to reduce production. For example, the commercial organ newspaper "Economic and Financial Gazette" said that although it has reached saturation, the general consumption is lower than the pre-war level, but the high price of olive oil is still maintained.

    This newspaper continued to say, just like the great crisis of 1929-33,

    "The bumper harvest of Tunisian olives (which can harvest 100,000 tons) has been regarded as a disaster."

    On the one hand, there is a close and organic connection between the increase in unemployment and the reduction in consumption, and on the other hand, the agricultural crisis continues to expand. This situation has never been more obvious than today.

    This is exactly the policy of the bourgeois government, which guarantees the huge profits of monopoly capital by brutally exploiting the working masses as consumers and taxpayers, regardless of the serious growth of the agricultural crisis.

    Between 1943 and 1949, the U.S. government spent 500 million U.S. dollars of public funds to maintain the high price of potatoes. These state funds went into the pockets of agricultural capitalists and rich peasants. In addition, they stole a lot of money directly from the taxpayers' pockets in the form of surplus profits. Because the price maintenance system has increased the cost of potatoes by at least double for consumers.

    The consumption base, which is already narrow in capitalist society, has become narrower since the war, which is not surprising. Lenin cited the example of replacing butter with margarine as a characteristic of the poverty of the proletariat. In 1949, the consumption of butter in the United Kingdom was only half of that before the war. The per capita consumption of butter in the United States was particularly lower than before the war, and it decreased by 36.5 percent in 1949. But according to bourgeois newspapers, the consumption of margarine is doubling in the United Kingdom and the United States.

      ×      ×      ×

    The newspapers owned by monopoly capitalists often depict a prosperous and thriving situation and avoid facing the future, but the economic crisis in the capitalist world is not lessened by this. Naturally, some bourgeois economists occasionally look ahead, but their views on the future are not "auspicious." "U.S. News & World Report" recently made an estimate that if everything continues to develop as it is today, by 1954, the number of unemployed people in the United States will increase to 7.3 million: 4.4 million are unemployed due to increased production efficiency, and another 2.9 million are unemployed due to the growth of the labor force. This is the prospect that the capitalists have arranged for the American working class.

    No matter how stubbornly the monopoly capitalists and their hired scholars deny reality, the economic crisis in the capitalist world is increasing its momentum. The sharp rise and fall of the industrial production index cannot get rid of the fact that the road the capitalist economy is taking is the road of crisis.

　　美国经济危机的现阶段
    Ａ·马努库安作
    孙瑞·陈右民合译
    对于整个资本主义世界来说，一九四九年是新的经济危机的第一年。战后初期，主要资本主义国家的工业生产，虽然增长得缓慢，一般的趋势是上升的；但到了一九四九年，工业生产开始下降了。与这一下降同时，是工人们益趋贫困，是劳动群众与一小撮资产阶级寄生虫之间在生活水平上的鸿沟更加阔而深。
    首要资本主义国家的美国，它的工业生产在一年内降低了百分之八点三。战争结束后三年来美国所获的增产已为之一笔勾消，差不多回复到了一九四六年的生产水平。但是在同时期的三年内，苏联的工业产量却增加了百分之八十五。
    然而美国工业产量的降低尚未能说明美国经济危机发展的全貌。美国反动派正执行军备竞赛政策，大量的战争契约膨胀了军火生产。据一位美国经济学家约里斯·希尔斯的估计，至一九四九年年底，美国有六百五十万人直接或间接在为军备竞赛和准备战争的有关的工厂内工作。无论这一估计的立场如何，这等于公开承认：准备侵略战争和军国主义化已成为资本主义国家经济的基础了。
    重要工业部门的产量降低是在一般降低的水平以上的。例如，煤产在一九四九年降低百分之二十七点五，钢百分之十二点二，摩托卡车百分之十八，铁路车辆百分之十七点八。铸铝产量降低百分之四十二点六。工业消费用铅降低百分之二十二。铁路运输量降低百分之十五点九。在能以具体数字计算升降情况的那些工业部门，事实上生产下降要比一般工业生产指数所能判断的大得多。进一步再看，像下面的一些事实，单纯的指数即反映不出来，如：
    全部农业收入在一九四九年降低百分之二十点三；
    失业人数，依据大大低估的官方统计，增加了百分之八十（一九四八年底是一百九十四万一千人，一九四九年底是三百四十八万九千）尚不包括部分失业者在内；
    企业倒闭增加了百分之七十五；
    消费者负债额增加了百分之十五点一等等。
    下列事实也应加上：一九四九年工业与商业建筑的体积等于一九四八年的百分之七十或八十，美国煤炭与汽车出口降低了百分之三十六至三十八。
    所有上述数字与事实均在工业生产指数的范围以外。然即此已足够说明农业危机的发展、农民与工人阶级的日趋贫困、大量小企业的破产、投资的减少和美国工业品在国外市场的缩减。
    仍应注意者是在一九四九年内，许多经济危机的征象尚未完全成熟，其影响也尚未完全发挥。然而毫无疑义，美国的工商业即将在不久的将来感受到这一效果。例如，农民收入降低虽然没有影响一九四九年的农业机器产量，但一九五○年财政年度的首季，美国最大一个农业机器工厂（国际哈瓦斯特公司）售出量与上年同季比较已经减少了百分之十九，另一工厂（凯斯公司）竟减少了百分之六十二点三。一九五○年首季与去年同季比较，拖拉机产量减少百分之二十五。
    现在，分期付款办法是刺激工业生产的主要作用，但此后数月内消费者负债的增加，必然要严重的影响零售商业。
    同时，更值得注意的事实是美国经济危机不平衡的发展。工业生产要受许多因素的影响，工业产量的这一曲线是锯齿状的。另外，不得不加以注意的是官方的指数常有很大出入。例如，为了安定人心，一九四九年十月的指数即曾匆匆加以“修正”。
    一九四九年七月工业产量与一九四八年十月的水准相较降低了百分之十八，接着又是十月里的指数一次新的降低，和一九四八年十月相较降低了百分之二十二，猛降之后，美国工业生产才又显示出上涨趋势。列表如下：
      美国工业生产（以一九三五——三九＝一○○）时间
              指数一九四八、十 
               一九九一九四九、二        
        一八五一九四九、七     
           一六三一九四九、十（原来）    
    一五五一九四九、十（修正后）         
       一六九一九五○、一      一七九一九五○、二      一七六
    季节升降不计
    一九四九年秋天，企业活动的紧缩现象特别显著的时候，美国报纸对远景的看法是非常悲观的。例如独占资本的机关报“商务日报”一九四九年十一月七日写道：
    “罢工后的生产回升不能认为是改变了商业情景的基本状况。”
    可是生产曲线只有些微的上升，而资产阶级的经济学家就开始无限乐观了。连那些一向肯定说并没有危机的报纸现在也大言不惭地宣称“危机已经过去”。这样，我们有了一九二九至三○年所发生过的情形的惊人的翻版。在一九三○年二月至四月，当工业生产指数升至较一九二九年十二月高达百分之十二至十四时，专门的乐观派就出来得意的力称：危机已经过去。但是一九三○年危机的发展已证明这些经济学家对发展的趋势懂得多么少。今天，美国资产阶级报纸所作关于美国业已度过或正在度过危机的乐观保证，都是典型的主观愿望。
    实际上，在那些决定美国经济活动长远前途的基本部门中，没有能够改变危机的一般条件。我们试列出一些典型的例证。
    一九五○年二月和三月，美国的出口低于一九四九年同期百分之二十六。今年第一季的投资数额作为整年计算是一百五十三亿美元。必须注意到所有大企业都已宣布它们的发展计划不是已经完成便是接近完成。这使美国的经济学家也预料一九五○年的投资将再锐降百分之十三。同时，铁路公司将减少投资百分之四十四，矿业公司将减少百分之十七，电业公司将减少百分之三十二不等。
    目前美国工业产量的增加主要是由于临时性的原因，特别是在煤矿和钢铁工业。目前煤斤每周一千三百三十万吨的产量大部分是由于长期煤矿工人罢工而需要补充储备才有增加，这一个生产率显然是超过当时的消费的。正如华尔街日报的一位读者投书说的，这样造成大量囤积势将在以后两三个月引起激烈的价格斗争，结果是摧残广大的小企业和大量煤矿的倒闭。报纸上的报道指出煤的价格与生产的下落已经开始了。
    在钢铁工业中也可以看到同样的景象。“摩地股票观察”杂志说：“目前的活跃一部分是人为的。”它估计一九五○年钢的输出与铁路及造船工业消费量将下降百分之二十五至三十，农业与汽车工业的需要则下降百分之十至十五。“今年最初几个月人为的高涨与后半年的相当低下”是“摩地股票观察”杂志对一九五○年生产情况的预言。
    美国经济学家感到特别兴奋的公共汽车生产是靠特殊措施才维持着一个人为的高水平。分期付款售货制度在汽车部门中已达于破裂点。报纸在评论中很惋惜地说，查里斯莱公司“错过了时光”，由于其工厂二月至四月的罢工，丧失了市场中的地位。这种对于今天存在而明天便过去的时机热望，就是美国市场情形一般的特性。而当美国的经济愈来愈须要依赖麻醉的刺激的时候，这局势的特殊性就更加严重了。
    一些工业部门的生产上升是脆弱和暂时的，另外一些经济活动的指数证明了危机趋势的坚定不移。
    最典型的是卡车的生产，一九四九年下降了百分之十八，一九五○年第一季再下降了百分之十一。一九四九年对铁路车皮的新订货单降低到等于一九四八年的零头。一月和二月在建筑中的房子数目是增加了，但是工商业建筑物的体积比一九四九年年初少了百分之二十二。
    经济危机在发展中，购买力日渐低下，一个显著的标志是百货商店零售（衣着、鞋、纺织品，也包括食品）较一九四九年减少百分之二——七，而一九四九年则已低于一九四八年了。
    美国的经济学家们用统计数字指出在一九五○年的一月份内，耐久商品（如汽车、电视机等等）的购买是有某些增加了，他们企图以此来消除由于惊人的数字所引起的印象。但是他们并没有指出促成购买力增加的款额是从什么地方来的。一般情形都是如此，耐久商品是以分期付款的方式来购买的，这就使得消费者变成了债户。分期付款购买制度是被夸耀为美国最大的成就之一的理由是：这一制度能把所有的天堂幸福赐给普通人民。但这一天堂却是“愚人的天堂”，因为购买者只要有一次不能按期付款，就不但要交回他所买得的，而且还得丧失已付出的款项。
    消费者的负债仅在一九四九年一年内就增加到近乎二十五亿美元，并且还在继续增加。非农产品抵押债款现已两倍于一九四五年的总数，并且还在迅速地增加着。
    美国的银行界也同样为这些事实所烦恼，在一九五○年三月二十八日，价值七亿三千四百万美元的新股票还是留在发股票的企业手中。因为“公众”没有购买的要求。
    商业活动中有非常少数继续表示有上升倾向的指数之一，就是大独占资本的利润。危机已痛苦的袭击了工人与小农户，但是它却绝未影响到大企业的利益。据报纸的报导，仅仅是现金红利（股票红利未计算在内）就从一九四八年的六十亿零九千三百万元，增加到一九四九年的六十四亿九千五百万美元。
    由于物价的上涨，一些在一九四九年内销售量减少的工业部门，其利润依然在增加。例如美国钢铁公司的销售量从一九四八年的二十四亿八千一百万美元降至一九四九年的二十三亿零二百万美元，但在同时期内，它的利润却从二亿八千八百万美元增加到三亿四千八百万美元。
    大独占企业对于中小企业的排斥，在一九四九年内继续剧烈的增强了。在所谓“人民的资本主义”的幌子下，独占资本在“私人企业竞争”中对它们的同业是毫不怜悯的。仅仅在一九四九年内，商业部门中倒闭的有四十八万家美国中小企业。小企业中间的不满是如此显著，以至于使得杜鲁门总统最近感到有必要补充他的竞选诺言的纲领，保证要保障小企业的利益。但这个诺言并不比其他的谎话更有价值。同时，那些资本少于五百万美元的制造商的总资产在一年内减少了十五亿三千七百万美元，而那些拥有五百万至一亿美元或更大资本的厂商却增加了五十亿零二千一百万美元的资金。这个道理是非常清楚的。独占资本借着加紧对于工人阶级的剥削和牺牲非独占性的工业与工厂，在目前还能够维持它们高度的超额利润。销售量上的百分比率便可以说明这一点，在第一类企业（指资本少于五百万美元者）内，这个比率由一九四九年商业的百分之○·一增加到百分之五·七，而在第二类企业（指资本多于五百万美元者）中它竟高达百分之一二·六。
    中小汽车制造业正在招致亏累而挣扎在崩溃的边缘上。另一方面，大独占资本如通用汽车公司却一年一年的增加利润。这个公司自工人剥削所得的平均数一九四九年比一九四七年增加了百分之六·九，而在同一时期里，它的总销售量增加了百分之五十，它的总利润则增加了百分之一百零一点一，这些数字说明了通用汽车公司在一九四七年平均要从它所雇用的每一个工人身上剥夺一千五百八十五美元，一九四八年为二千二百九十五美元，而在一九四九年则增为二千九百九十美元。
    大独占企业继续走向繁荣，但是它们的繁荣是得自工人阶级的血汗，工人阶级正日益绝对地也是相对地更加贫困。官方的数字虽经有系统的窜改与一再的伪造，但掩盖不了这一事实，即根据这些数字也能够说明：无产阶级雇用工人一九四九年每周平均收入虽较一九四四年增加百分之十九，但同期内物价却增加了百分之三十五。
    马歇尔计划原为美国独占资本家所策划作为将危机和失业输往西欧国家的工具的。在战后最初几年中，欧洲的资本主义国家都一再炫耀其复兴计划与方案，但是当危机刚刚开始露出其凶焰时，所有这些计划与方案都加以搁置了。法国政府官方宣布决定一九五○年煤产量计划从六千四百五十万吨减少到五千四百万吨，这个数目大致和一九四九年相等，而比一九二九年的产量还要减少一百万吨。为了过剩的商品，煤矿受命在一个月内停工两天。然而，值得注意的是法国仍在输入美国和德国煤——这是马歇尔计划的“礼物”，法国不敢拒绝的。
    在过去几个月中，美国和欧洲几个资本主义国家中的逐渐增涨着的危机还没有使它们的工业总生产量遭到新的减缩。在它的现阶段，危机主要的表现在债务的增加，剩余物品的堆积以及小企业者批发的失败。但除此之外，在某些不大明显的情形下，危机的发展与失业的急剧增加，工人阶级生活水平的恶化以及农业危机的发展是不可分离的。
    资本主义国家的经济活动中的特征，就是失业人数在有规律地普遍地和急速地增加着。根据美国官方的数字，今年二月间美国完全失业的人数是四百六十八万四千人。但另外必须加上二百二十五万八千人被认为“只有工作职位而不是在工作”的人，以及只做部分工作的半失业者八百九十二万七千人。今年秋天仍将有一百七十万人成为“寻找工作者”。这数百万人寻找工作者的机会是非常渺茫的，美国劳工部也承认在这方面的前途是异常暗淡：“就业的远景是十年来最凄惨的了。”
    劳工部的调查报告证明失业特别严重的地区正在增加，麻萨诸塞州劳伦斯地方的劳动人民百分之二十以上失业，该调查报告说工作易于到手的职业只是医生、牙医和—侍候疯子的人！战争贩子和战争歇斯底里的煽动者至少可以吹嘘说已经给这些人制造了工作机会了。
    由于伴随着失业而来的仅是工业生产的些微下降，甚至完全没有下降，因此目前失业的增加情况是更加严重了。
    据公布的指数来看，在西德，一九四九年全部工业产量比一九四八年增高了，然而根据官方数字，一九四八年十二月失业人数达七十五万九千人，一九四九年底则倍于此数，而在今年二月中旬，西德失业人数达二百零一万八千人。这一数字尚未包括柏林西区的四十万失业者在内。
    西欧失业的巨大增加只有一个原因，就是残忍的资本主义的“合理化制度”，这一“制度”与经济危机的发展密不可分。而这一切恶果的根源用一个名辞即可概括——马歇尔计划化。法国和意大利整个工业为其排斥殆尽，数十个国营机器制造厂和冶金工厂当做零件出卖；而在日本则以无利可图为口实，使许多煤矿倒闭。由于美国的竞争而窒息的西德和斯堪的那维亚国家以及其他国家的各种工业，都倒闭了。
    没有一个资本主义国家官方统计没有注明失业在急剧增长。在一年里，芬兰失业人数增加百分之一百零三点四，德国美英占领区增加了百分之一百，法占领区增加了百分之三百七十五，瑞士增加了百分之一百，法国增加了百分之五十六，加拿大增加了百分之五十四，荷兰增加了百分之五十二点六，奥地利增加了百分之四十九点五，比利时增加了百分之二十二，挪威增加了百分之二十一。在意大利，尽管官方数字中一再“拔除”失业者，但失业人数的登记仍有二百万，而尚不包括二十五万政府失业雇员和一百五十万临时性质的农业工人。
    特别显著的征象是女工和童工受雇的增加，这是在危机期中常有的现象。美国“商业周刊”称，一九四九年美国雇用女工在几个月内增加了三十五万人，而在同期男工却有七十万人失了业。“商业周刊”巧妙地解释说，这样做，只是为了减低劳工成本。
    资本主义国家当前经济情况的另一特性，是农业危机的继续发展，这不仅深刻表现在美国，而且也蔓延至马歇尔计划化的其他各国。正和一九二九——三三年情形相同，现在的农产过剩品正急剧增加。在美国，为人民大众急切需要而珍贵的农产物，用作饲料，或干脆毁掉。
    为了挽救价格的下降（这一下降不利于独占资本与地主），美国政府下令今年棉田和种植面积减缩百分之二十三，麦田面积减缩百分之十四，玉蜀黍田面积减缩百分之十三，花生田面积减缩百分之二十。这一结果，将使所有失业中最恐怖的一种现象出现——农村失业，因为这一失业是无形的和未登记的。南部的千百万的佃农将因此而深受痛苦。流动漂泊的农业劳动失业队伍，甚至连他们仅有的一季所得也被剥削了去。
    法国不久前宣布废止食糖配给，然而又立即面临甜菜生产过剩。法国政府除抄袭美国的老法子减缩甜菜种植面积百分之十五以外，其他对策是没有的。每当主要食品消费特别低落的时候，缩减生产就成为必要了。例如商业机关报《经济财政公报》说，虽然已达饱和状态，一般消费量又低于战前水平，但橄榄油的高价仍然维持着。
    这一报纸继续说，正如一九二九——三三年大危机一样，
    “突尼斯橄榄的丰收，（可以有十万吨的收成）已被人视为灾祸了。”
    一方面是失业增涨与消费减缩中间密切而有机的联系，一方面是农业危机继续扩展，这一情况再也没有比今天更加明显。
    这正是资产阶级政府的政策，不顾农业危机的严重增长，把工人大众当作消费者兼纳税人加以残酷的剥削，而保证了独占资本的丰厚利润。
    一九四三年至四九年间，美国政府支出五亿美元的公帑，维持马铃薯的高价格。这些国家公帑都进到农业资本家和富农的腰包里。此外，他们又以剩余利润的方式直接从纳税人钱袋里窃取了不少数目。因为维持价格制度对消费者来说，就使马铃薯的成本至少增加了一倍。
    消费基础，在资本主义社会里已经是狭小的了，而自战后以来，则变得更为狭小，此事原不足奇。列宁曾举例说，以人造奶油代替牛油是无产阶级贫困的一个特征。一九四九年英国牛油消费量仅为战前之一半。美国每人的牛油消费量已特别低于战前，在一九四九年则又降低了百分之三十六点五。但据资产阶级报纸载称，人造奶油的消费量在英国和美国都在加倍的提高。
      ×      ×      ×
    独占资本家所有的报纸，往往描绘出繁荣与景气的统治局面，而避免正视未来，但资本主义世界经济危机却并不因此而稍减。自然，偶尔也有一些资产阶级的经济学家望望前面，但他们对未来的看法，却非“吉兆”。“美国新闻与世界报道”最近曾做过一个估计，如果一切都照今天的情形发展下去，则到一九五四年为止，美国失业人数将增加到七百卅万：其中四百四十万是由于生产效率增加而失业，另外二百九十万是由于劳动力之生长而失业。这也就是资本家为美国工人阶级安排下的远景。
    不管独占资本家与其御用学者们如何顽强地否认现实，但资本主义世界的经济危机正在增加其态势。工业生产指数的猛烈升降，总摆脱不开这一事实，即资本主义经济正在走着的这一条道路是危机之路。
