　　Improving the Efficiency of Soldiers' Cultural Learning
    A Certain Division Adopts the "Writing Sentences" Method
    To Enhance Learning Interest and Achieve Writing and Application
    [This Newspaper Report] A certain division of the Northeast Military Region has universally adopted the "writing sentences" method in its cultural learning, greatly improving the learning efficiency of the soldiers. In March and April, over 90% of the comrades in the division completed the task of learning 300 characters, and the rest learned more than 100 characters. Comrades in the entire division who knew less than 300 characters accounted for only 6% of the total number of people. The "writing sentences" method was first created by individual units in their cultural learning. After the division's leading organs summarized and improved it, the division's political department formulated specific measures and instructed the entire division to implement it universally. The regulations are as follows: All comrades participating in the learning of Groups B and C (knowing 600-700 to 200-300 characters) must write one or several sentences every day; Group A must write a diary every day; Group D must write the new characters they have learned until they can write them. There are several ways to "write sentences": The first is that soldiers use the characters they have learned to write a sentence or several sentences at will in their spare time, and ask others if they encounter characters they don't know how to write. After writing, the learning group leader of the platoon revises it and records it in the individual's study notebook. The second is "dialogue." Every day, the cultural instructor or learning group leader writes half a sentence or several characters, and everyone completes it into a sentence, which is copied into the notebook after revision. Another is "dialogue competition." During the competition, a blackboard is placed in the yard, and each learning group lines up. First, the first person in the first group writes a character on the blackboard, and then the first person in the second, third, and other groups adds characters in turn to form a sentence. Then, in turn, the second, third, and other members of each group do the same. After completion, the grades of each group are evaluated.
    Since the launch of the "writing sentences" movement in the division, it has corrected the problem of soldiers only knowing how to recognize but not how to write, or only knowing how to write but not how to use the characters they have learned. It has also helped everyone's memory and improved everyone's interest in learning. According to statistics from a certain regiment, more than 90% of the comrades in the regiment can now "write sentences," and they have universally established "writing sentences notebooks."
    When "writing sentences," the cultural instructors of each unit should first teach the soldiers some basic cultural knowledge, explaining what constitutes a sentence. At the beginning, soldiers often write things that are not sentences or incomplete sentences, and they should be patiently helped to learn to write complete sentences. Secondly, when many soldiers start writing, they always feel that they don't know where to start, or they write things like "Dear Parents," "Finished eating," or copy from books. Therefore, they should be guided to pay attention to writing more sentences related to daily work and life, preferably sentences with educational significance, such as "The company is going to hold a democratic meeting, and I want to prepare my opinions well." etc. Thirdly, the sentences written by the soldiers must be carefully revised, especially paying attention to correcting incorrect and misused characters. It is best to have everyone revise them in learning groups after writing them every evening, and the learning group leader evaluates the quality to encourage progress. In addition, the "writing sentences" notebooks should be bound uniformly, and the date should be recorded for each day's writing for future inspection to compare the degree of progress of each person. When the time is right, soldiers should be guided to gradually write paragraphs of diary. ("Forward" Newspaper)

### 提高战士文化学习效率  某师采用“写话”方法  提高学习兴趣·做到会写会用

　　提高战士文化学习效率
    某师采用“写话”方法
    提高学习兴趣·做到会写会用
    【本报讯】东北军区某师在文化学习中，普遍采用“写话”方法，大大提高了战士的学习效率。该师在三、四两月，百分之九十以上的同志完成了学会三百字的任务，其余也都学会百字以上。全师识三百字以下的同志，仅占总人数的百分之六了。“写话”方法首先是个别部队在文化学习中创造出来的，后经该师领导机关总结提高，师政治部规定具体办法，指示全师普遍推行。其规定是：凡参加乙、丙组（识六、七百到二、三百字的）学习的同志，每人每天都要写一句话或几句话；甲组每天都要写日记；丁组则每天把所学的生字写会。“写话”的方法有几种：第一种，战士们在课外时间，用学过的字随便写成一句或几句话，遇有不会写的字则问别人。写好之后经排的学习组长修改后，记在个人的学习本子上。第二种是“对话”，每天由文化教员或学习组长写出半句话或几个字，让大家对成一句话，经修改后抄在本子上。另一种是“比赛对话”，比赛时在院子里放一块黑板，各学习组排好队，首先由第一组第一名到黑板上写一个字，然后由第二、第三等组第一名依次去加上字联成一句话。再依此轮到各组的第二名、第三名等。完毕之后，评定各组成绩。
    该师自“写话”运动开展以来，纠正了战士们学了字光会认不会写或光会写不会用的毛病，而且帮助了大家的记忆，提高了大家的学习兴趣。据某团统计，全团已有百分之九十以上的同志能“写话”了，而且普遍建立了“写话本”。
    “写话”时各单位的文化教员应首先教会战士们一些简单的文化常识，说明怎样才能算一句话。开始时战士们常常写一些话不成话、句不成句的东西，应耐心地帮助他们学会写完整的句子。其次，许多战士开始写时，总感到不知从什么地方着手写，或者写些“父母亲大人”、“吃饭完了”之类，或者照着书抄。因此，应引导他们注意多写与日常工作、生活有联系的句子，最好是富有教育意义的句子，如“连里要开民主大会，我要好好准备意见。”等。第三，战士写了的句子必须细心修改，特别是错、别字要注意纠正。最好每天晚上写完之后，以学习小组为单位由大家来修改，并交学习小组长评定好坏，以鼓励进步。另外，“写话”本子应统一装订，每天写的记上日期，以备日后检查，对照每个人的进步程度。到了适当时期，应引导战士逐步写成段的日记。（《前进》报）
