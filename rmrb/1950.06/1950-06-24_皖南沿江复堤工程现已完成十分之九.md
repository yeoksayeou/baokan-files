　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhu, 13th. The project of repairing embankments and restoring dikes along the Yangtze River in Southern Anhui District has been basically and successfully completed after two seasons of construction, last winter and this spring. The total length of the key dikes and weirs to be repaired in the district is 1,632 kilometers, with a total earthwork of 16,916,000 cubic meters. Except for a few weir areas that are still being repaired, 91% of the total project has been completed. A total of more than 100 large and small dikes have been repaired, involving more than 11 million workers and the distribution of more than 50 million catties of work grain. During the concentrated dike repair in March and April this spring, the average number of workers on the dikes in the district reached more than 200,000 per day. The in-depth leadership of cadres at all levels of the people's government and the day and night rush repairs by the workers enabled the project to be completed quickly, ensuring that farmers did not miss the farming season and could carry out spring plowing in a timely manner.
　　The winter repair project in the whole district lasted from the end of December last year to the middle of February this year. Due to the lack of experience in leadership and insufficient preparation, the winter repair project progressed very slowly, and only 16% of the winter repair plan for the whole district was completed. Therefore, before the spring repair began in late February this year, the leading organs first convened the Southern Anhui District Spring Repair Conference to learn from the winter repair experience. During the spring repair, the commissioners and county heads of the counties along the river, as well as more than 6,000 cadres and 100 technical personnel, personally went to the dikes to provide specific leadership. In addition, the method of calculating work and distributing grain had been improved, and the combination of work-for-relief and disaster relief was effectively implemented. The number of workers on the dikes increased greatly, more than four times that of the winter repair, and the work progress also exceeded more than three times that of the winter repair. In terms of engineering quality, the work of ramming and tamping has been carried out extensively on each dike, which has also been greatly improved compared to the past. At the same time, the old dike committees have also been gradually transformed, and experienced and active elements have been trained and absorbed in large numbers to participate, so as to achieve close integration of technology, administration and the masses. In total, the district has trained 850 engineering recorders in the repair project, and 141 dike repair models have emerged, and 91 cadres have been promoted.

　　皖南沿江复堤工程现已完成十分之九
    【新华社芜湖十三日电】皖南区沿长江修堤复圩的工程，经过去冬今春两季兴修，已基本上胜利完成。全区计划修复的江堤重点圩共长一千六百三十二公里，总工程一千六百九十一万六千多土方，现除个别圩区尚在继续培修外，共已完成总工程的百分之九十一强。计共修好大小圩堤一百余个，动用民工一千一百多万工，发放工粮五千余万斤。今春三、四月间突击修堤时，全区每日上堤民工平均达二十万人以上。各级人民政府干部的深入领导与民工的日夜赶修，使工程得以迅速完成，并作到使农民不误农时，及时春耕。
    全区冬修工程系自去年十二月底至今年二月中旬止。由于领导上缺乏经验，准备工作不充分，冬修工程进展很慢，全区冬修计划仅完成百分之十六。因此，在今年二月下旬开始春修前，领导机关先召开了皖南区春修会议，以吸取冬修经验。在春修中沿江各县专员、县长及六千余干部、百余技术人员均亲自上堤具体领导，加上计工发粮办法已有改进，并切实实行以工代赈与救灾工作密切结合，民工上堤人数乃大大增加，超过冬修时四倍，工作进度也超过冬修时三倍以上。工程质的方面，由于各堤普遍进行夯硪工，也较前大大提高。同时旧堤委会亦逐步改造、大量培养和吸收有经验的积极分子参加，做到技术、行政与群众的密切结合。总计全区在修复工程中共培养了八百五十名工程纪录员，涌现了一百四十一名修圩模范，提拔了九十一名干部。
