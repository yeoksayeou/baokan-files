　　Digging the Canal
    Li Mu
     Coarse wire, tied to dirt baskets,
     Shiny stones sharpen iron picks,
     What is all this bustling about for?
     Everyone rejoices to start digging the canal.
　
     Stars still in the sky,
     Who is running on the riverbed?
     It seems a breakthrough has been made,
     The pursuing Liberation Army has charged in.
　
     Not afraid of rain, not afraid of wind,
     Nothing can stop the people's soldiers,
     Digging the canal is for the people,
     Sore backs and aching legs are nothing!
　
     The loudspeaker broadcasts from west to east,
     The blackboard news is filled to the brim,
     Magic lantern shows never end, clappering rhymes are endless,
     The model deeds, the heroic people!
　
     "Young man, you're great, even better than us!"
     The villagers' thumbs go up again and again.
     We fought a beautiful battle in production,
     A fifty-day project was completed in a month.
　
     On the site, red flags are red,
     The valiant soldiers are beaming with joy,
     The red flag illuminates our faces,
     Chairman Mao illuminates our hearts!
            May 1950

　　挖河
    力牧
     粗铁丝，绑土篮，
     光光的石头磨铁铣，
     忙忙碌碌为什么？
     开工挖河人人欢。
　
     天上还有星星，
     河床上谁在跑动？
     好像打开了突破口，
     冲进了追击的解放军。
　
     不怕雨，不怕风，
     啥也挡不住人民的兵，
     挖河为的是人民，
     腰酸腿痛算不了甚！
　
     广播筒从西到东，
     黑板报写得没了缝，
     洋片拉不完，快板数不尽，
     模范的事迹，英雄的人！
　
     “小伙子真棒，比我们还行！”
     老乡的大拇指伸了又伸。
     生产当中打了个漂亮仗，
     五十天的工程一个月交了工。
　
     现场上，红旗红，
     善战的健儿喜盈盈，
     红旗照红了咱的脸，
     毛主席照亮了咱的心！
            一九五○年五月
