　　Thirteenth District Cadre Spare-time School Takes Care of Study for Cadres Sent to the Countryside

　　[Report from this newspaper] The spare-time cadre school in the Thirteenth District of Beijing suburbs has formally started. Participating units include the District Committee, District Government, Public Security Bureau, Public Security School, District Trade Union, Chaoyang Coal Mine, and cadres from various units in nearby streets and villages, totaling 242 people.

　　Before the school was established, special consideration was given to the study problems of cadres who frequently go to the countryside. Among the cadres sent to the countryside, the vast majority are of worker-peasant origin, making it impossible for them to study with the regular classes. Now, each work team has a兼任 (兼任 jiānrèn is a word that means something like "concurrent post" or "additional task". Let's translate it to "part-time") teacher, who is a cadre of worker-peasant background from the same team. They set aside fixed time each day to teach worker-peasant cadres to learn to read and write, teaching in the same way as the regular classes and following the same rules.

　　The school, based on the principle of standardization, has established teaching regulations, classroom rules, etc.; opposing the "come as you please" guerrilla style. If students are absent or need to take leave, they must first obtain approval from the head of their unit, and then submit it to the class teacher.

　　At the beginning of the semester, the students were in high spirits, shouting slogans everywhere such as "Without learning culture, we cannot learn Marxism-Leninism theory!" and "Improving culture will allow us to better serve the people!"

　　At the opening ceremony, student representative Wang Zhengmin said: In the school, there are only principals, teachers, and students. There are no ministers, directors, or section chiefs. Some of the teachers have lower positions and shorter working hours than the students, but they are educated, and we must learn culture from the teachers!

　　Many comrades recalled the pain of not having culture for many years, and remembered the difficulty poor people had in attending school in the old society, greatly increasing their enthusiasm for learning. Zhang Qinggui, a cadre from Chaoyang Market Street, said: "I was a rickshaw puller. In the past, the Kuomintang oppressed us, and we couldn't even get enough to eat, let alone have the opportunity to go to school. Now that the Communist Party has come, it has established spare-time schools, and I must study hard!" Comrade Wang Haihui said: "I have been working for three years, and I often feel the pain of not having culture. Sometimes, a word or a clause is hard to understand, and I don't know how to work." Female cadre Liu Shutian said: "I have been working for a long time, but I have never attended a formal school. In the guerrilla environment, there was no opportunity to sit down and study. The victory of the revolution has given us the opportunity to learn. I am a woman and a mother, but I must also take the time to study hard!"

　　Cadres of intellectual background voluntarily offered to help worker-peasant cadres learn to read and write, saying: "This is our duty, and we must help our comrades improve their culture!"

### 十三区干部业余学校照顾下乡干部学习

　　十三区干部业余学校照顾下乡干部学习
    【本报讯】京郊十三区干部业余学校已正式开学。参加的单位有区委会、区政府、公安分局、公安学校、区工会、朝阳煤厂、附近街村各单位干部共二百四十二人。
    该校成立之前，特别照顾了经常下乡干部的学习问题。下乡干部中，工农出身的同志占绝大多数，不可能随班学习。现在每个工作组设立了兼任教员一个，由该组学生出身干部担任，每天抽出固定时间，教授工农干部学文化，同样按班级教课，执行同样制度。
    该校本着正规化方针，定出了教学规定，教室规则等；反对“想来就来”的游击作风。学员缺课请假，必先经本机关首长批准，再交班主任。
    开学时，学员的情绪都很高，到处喊“不学习文化就不能学习马列主义理论！”“提高文化才能更好的为人民服务！”的口号。
    在开学典礼大会上，学生代表王政民说：在学校里只有校长、教员、学生，没有什么部长、主任、科长，教员同志有的还比学生的工作岗位低，工作时间短，但是他们有文化，我们要向老师好好学文化！
    许多同志回忆起多年来没有文化的痛苦，想起在旧社会中穷人上学的难处，大大提高了学习情绪。朝阳市场街干部张庆贵说：“我是三轮工人出身，过去国民党压迫我们，饭也吃不上，那有上学的机会？今天共产党来了，办了业余学校，我一定好好学习！”王海会同志说：“我参加工作三年了，常感到没有文化的痛苦，有时候一个字，一个条文，不懂意思，就不知怎样工作。”女干部刘书田说：“我工作时间不短，可是没有上过一天正式的学校。在游击环境里，没有坐下念书，革命的胜利给了我们学习的机会。我是妇女，又是孩子的妈妈，可是我也要拿出时间来好好学习！”
    知识分子出身的干部们，自愿提出帮助工农干部学文化，他们说：“这是我们的义务，一定帮助同志们提高文化！”
