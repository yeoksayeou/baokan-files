Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: Violating the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's regulations on guaranteeing the basic human rights of the Japanese people, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries continue to prohibit assemblies and demonstrations organized by progressive groups. According to Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo: In order to alleviate the Japanese people's opposition to the authorities' tyrannical prohibition of all demonstrations and assemblies, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department held a meeting of station chiefs on the 24th. Police Superintendent General Eiichi Tanaka stated in a speech that, from the 25th onwards, "daily public activities and normal labor movement assemblies, etc." would no longer be prohibited. "However, based on the nature of the sponsoring groups or leaders, assemblies, collective marches, or collective demonstrations that threaten public peace and welfare, or are similar to violations of the purposes of the Allied Powers and the Allied authorities, will continue to be prohibited."

According to Reuters: When Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsuo Okazaki announced on the 17th that he would "relax" the order prohibiting assemblies and demonstrations, he shamefully equated the Communist Party with extreme nationalist groups, thus depriving the Japanese people of their right to assemble and demonstrate. He shamelessly claimed: "If assemblies and demonstrations are presided over by 'bad' groups such as the Communist Party or extreme nationalist groups, the ban will continue to be enforced."

　　美日反动派加紧摧残基本人权
    继续禁止日本人民集会与示威
    【新华社二十六日讯】美、日反动派违背波茨坦宣言与远东委员会关于保障日本人民基本人权的规定，继续禁止进步团体主办的集会和示威游行。据共同社东京讯：东京警察局为了缓和日本人民反对当局横暴地禁止一切示威及集会的情绪，于二十四日召开分局长会议。警视总监田中英一发表谈话称：自二十五日以后，对“日常的公共性质的活动及正常的劳工运动集会等”，将不再加以禁止。“但由主办团体或领导人的性格推断，关于威胁公共和平与福利，或类似违反盟国当局及盟国当局的目的的集会、集体游行或集体示威运动，今后仍在被禁止之列”。
    另据路透社讯：吉田内阁书记长官冈崎胜男在十七日宣布将“放宽”禁止集会及示威游行的命令时，竟将共产党与极端国家主义集团相提并论，与此剥夺日本人民集会与示威的权利。他无耻地声称：“如果集会与游行示威是由共产党或极端国家主义集团之类的‘不良’团体所主持，则禁令将继续予以执行”。
