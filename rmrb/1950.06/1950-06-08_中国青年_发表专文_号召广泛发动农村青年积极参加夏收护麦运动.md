　　“China Youth” Publishes Special Article
    Calling for Extensive Mobilization of Rural Youth to Actively Participate in the Summer Harvest Wheat Protection Campaign
    Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The 40th issue of "China Youth," published on June 3rd, released an article entitled "Extensively Mobilize Youth to Actively Participate in the Summer Harvest Wheat Protection Campaign." The article pointed out that rural Youth League members and League cadres should recognize the great importance of doing a good job in the wheat harvest for the national economic construction, the economic lives of the broad masses of farmers, and especially for resolving the current spring famine during the period between harvests. The article called on League members in areas where farmers have already been organized to help mutual aid teams formulate detailed summer harvest plans; in areas that have not been organized, to publicize the benefits of organizing; and in newly liberated areas, to become models for protecting the wheat, guarding against hidden special agents, bandits, scattered soldiers, and local bullies and landlords who may engage in theft, looting, arson, and other activities to sabotage the wheat harvest. The article pointed out that in order to improve rural production technology, Youth League members should publicize seed selection to the masses and participate in seed selection work themselves. League members should conscientiously help the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers who lack labor power with their wheat harvest. The article concluded by suggesting that after the harvest begins, League branches should hold fewer large meetings to avoid delaying the youth's labor time and causing them to become overly fatigued. After the wheat harvest, Youth League members should patiently promote "a steady flow of small streams" and practice thrift to the masses.

　　“中国青年”发表专文
    号召广泛发动农村青年积极参加夏收护麦运动
    【新华社五日讯】六月三日出版之“中国青年”第四十期发表《广泛发动青年积极参加夏收护麦运动》一文。该文指出，农村青年团员和团的干部应该认识到作好麦收，对于全国人民的经济建设，对于广大农民的经济生活，特别是对于解决当前青黄不接的春荒，有极大重要的意义。该文号召团员在农民已经组织起来的地区，帮助互助组制定周密的夏收计划；在没有组织起来的地区，宣传组织起来的好处；在新解放区，应成为护麦模范，防备潜藏的特务、土匪、散兵游勇以及恶霸地主等进行偷窃、抢掠、放火等破坏麦收的活动。该文指出，为提高农村生产技术，青年团员应向群众宣传选种和自己参加选种工作。对无劳动力的烈、军、工属，团员应认真帮助他们麦收。该文最后提出在收割开始后，团支部要少开大会，以免耽误青年的劳动时间与使他们的身体过分疲劳。麦收后，青年团员应向群众耐心宣传“细水长流”，实行节约。
