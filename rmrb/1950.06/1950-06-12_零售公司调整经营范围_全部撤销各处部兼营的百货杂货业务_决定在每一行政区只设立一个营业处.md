　　Retail Company Adjusts Business Scope
    All Departments and Sections' Concurrent Operation of General Merchandise Business Canceled
    Decision to Establish Only One Business Office in Each Administrative District
    [Beijing News Agency] In order to accommodate the sales market of private businesses, the Beijing Retail Company has decided to appropriately adjust its business scope on the principle of not affecting the stability of retail market prices. In addition to completely canceling the general merchandise business concurrently operated by various departments and sections (including ten sections concurrently operating general merchandise and twenty-eight sections concurrently operating sundries) since the 1st of this month, and suspending the preparation of a meat products department and a food products department that had been in the works for a long time, it was also decided to set up only one business office in each administrative district in the city, and adjust the retail stores under each department: canceling three business offices, seven grain retail stores, and three cloth retail stores. This specific measure by the government to adjust the relationship between public and private businesses has further stabilized the business sentiment of legitimate private industrialists and merchants in Beijing.
    After the Beijing Retail Company was officially established in January this year, it quickly developed more than 100 retail stores under the leadership of the People's Government, directly supplying citizens with essential daily necessities such as food, which played a significant role in stabilizing retail prices in the market and guaranteeing the lives of the majority of citizens. For example, around the Spring Festival in February, some merchants in Beijing mistakenly tried to speculate by taking advantage of the Spring Festival holiday period to hoard and refuse to sell. The retail company then vigorously supplied goods, remaining open until late at night on New Year's Eve, selling more than 700,000 catties of grain in one day, and starting business as early as the third day of the Lunar New Year, which was supported by the majority of citizens. At that time, the company began to concurrently operate a part of the general merchandise business due to the needs of the citizens. In March, after the central government unified financial and economic work, the company added several cotton cloth and general merchandise stores in order to assist various specialized companies in completing the task of stabilizing prices and withdrawing currency from circulation. As a result of the expansion of retail business, some private industrialists and merchants became concerned. In order to implement the government's economic policy of taking into account both public and private interests, the company, under the correct leadership of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, took measures to adjust its business scope.
    The task of state-owned retail companies is to control and retail a certain amount of people's daily necessities such as grain, salt, coal, cooking oil, cloth, and kerosene in order to stabilize urban retail market prices and prevent speculative merchants from arbitrarily raising prices. It is not an attempt to replace all private business operations. The adjustment of the business scope of the Beijing Retail Company specifically illustrates that the government's policy of overall consideration of the five types of economy is firm and unwavering.

　　零售公司调整经营范围
    全部撤销各处部兼营的百货杂货业务
    决定在每一行政区只设立一个营业处
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市零售公司为了照顾私营商业销售市场，决定在不影响稳定零售市场物价的原则下，适当调整经营范围。除自本月一日起已全部撤销各处、部兼营的百货、杂货业务（其中兼营百货的十处，兼营杂货的二十八处）停开筹备已久的一个肉品部、一个食品部外，并决定在市内每一行政区只设一个营业处，调整各处所属零售店：撤销三个营业处、七个粮食零售店、三个布匹零售店。政府这一调整公私商业关系的具体措施，更进一步稳定了京市正当私营工商业者的经营情绪。
    京市零售公司在今年一月正式成立后，很快便在人民政府领导下发展了一百多个零售店，直接供应市民食粮等生活必需品，对稳定市场零售价、保障广大市民的生活起了很大作用。如二月间春节前后，京市一部分商人错误地想借春节休假期间投机，囤积拒售，零售公司乃大力供应，除夕营业至深夜，一日间售出粮食达七十余万斤，并于旧历正月初三便开始营业，受到广大市民的拥护。这时，该公司由于市民需要即开始兼营一部分百货、杂货业务。三月，中央统一财经工作后，该公司为了协助各专业公司完成稳定物价、回笼货币任务，并增设棉布，百货门市部数处。由于扩充零售业务的结果，引起一些私营工商业者的疑虑。该公司为了贯彻执行政府公私兼顾的经济政策，在中央人民政府贸易部与京市政府商业局正确领导下，做了调整经营范围的措施。
    国营零售公司的任务，在于掌握并零售一定量的粮、盐、煤、食油、布、煤油等人民生活必需品，以稳定城市零售市场物价，防止投机商人任意抬高价格，并不是企图代替一切私营商业的经营，京市零售公司对经营范围的调整，具体说明了政府对五种经济统筹兼顾的政策是坚定不移的。
