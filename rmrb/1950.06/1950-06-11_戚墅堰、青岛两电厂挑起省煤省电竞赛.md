    Qishuyan and Qingdao Power Plants
    Launch Coal and Electricity Saving Competition
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] The Qishuyan and Qingdao Power Plants have mutually launched a coal and electricity saving competition. This is a pioneering initiative for competitions between similar factories within China. In order to guarantee the fulfillment and surpassing of the factory's production plan and reduction of coal and electricity consumption standards stipulated by the National Electricity Industry Conference in February of this year, all employees of the Qishuyan Power Plant recently issued a challenge to their brother workers at the Qingdao Power Plant. After discussion, the Qingdao Power Plant workers unanimously decided to accept the challenge. Both sides have jointly drafted "Measures for the Coal and Electricity Saving Competition," and submitted them to the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry for record. The competition will run from June 1st to the end of December. The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry has prepared three brocade banners and plans to send personnel to jointly evaluate the results of one month, four months, and seven months with representatives from both factories at the end of June, September, and December respectively; the three brocade banners will be awarded to the winner who exceeds the task in reducing total power generation coal consumption, power transmission coal consumption, and self-used electricity each time. The December evaluation will be a summary of the seven-month long-term competition. The final winner of the brocade banner will be the ultimate winner. The two factories have also agreed to exchange various production results every five days during the competition period to facilitate mutual learning.

    戚墅堰、青岛两电厂
    挑起省煤省电竞赛
    【新华社四日讯】戚墅堰电厂和青岛电厂，互相开展省煤、省电竞赛。这是关内同类工厂间竞赛的创举。戚墅堰电厂的全体职工为保证完成与超过今年二月全国电业会议规定的该厂的生产计划和降低煤电消耗的标准，最近向青岛电厂的职工弟兄们提出挑战。青岛电厂职工经讨论后，一致决定应战。双方已共同拟定“省煤、省电竞赛办法”，呈报中央燃料工业部备案。竞赛自六月一日起，至十二月底止。中央燃料工业部已制就锦旗三面，准备于六月底、九月底及十二月底分别派员会同两厂代表评判一个月、四个月及七个月的成绩各一次；并将三面锦旗分别奖励每次在减低总发电煤耗、送电煤耗及自用电等方面超过任务的优胜者。十二月底的一次评判为七个月长期竞赛的总结。最后获得锦旗者即为最后的优胜者。两厂并约定在竞赛期间每隔五天交换各项生产成绩一次，以便互相学习。
