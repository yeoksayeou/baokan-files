　　Beijing Tram Company's First Workers' Congress
    Reports Production Achievements to Chairman Mao
    Launches Rationalization Proposals to Create New Records to Welcome "July 1st"
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Beijing Tram Company's First Workers' Congress on the 25th sent a letter to Chairman Mao reporting on the production plan (see this newspaper's Beijing News column for news of the congress). All employees of the company's repair and manufacturing plant also reported to Chairman Mao that they had completed the production of eighteen new locomotives ahead of schedule and resolutely guaranteed to strive to complete the annual task by September.
    The full text of the letter from the First Workers' Congress of the Tram Company to Chairman Mao is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    Under your wise leadership, we convened a meeting of all employee representatives on the 24th and 25th of this month to summarize the work from January to May. In the past five months, we have completed 51% of the annual task; the repair and manufacturing plant completed the production plan of manufacturing eighteen new locomotives in eight months in five months and twenty-five days. Worker Lu Yuntai suggested installing a water deflector on the tram, solving the problem of driving in rainy seasons for many years. The rectifier plant repaired the mercury rectifier that had been stored for seven years without repair, solving the power supply problem for 220 trams in the future. The coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of the power plant is also constantly decreasing, from 1.55 kilograms in 1949 to 1.36 kilograms. The tram lines have implemented a contract system for trams and routes, successfully operating the circular route that failed several times during the Japanese and Kuomintang reactionary rule. At this meeting, it was resolved to launch rationalization proposals and create new records in production and conservation to welcome the Party's birthday, and to use this as the direction of our future efforts. The repair and manufacturing plant strives to complete the annual production task in nine months. The power plant strives to break the new record of 1.1 kilograms of coal consumption per kilowatt-hour. The tram lines strive to create a new record of 10,000 kilometers of safe driving. At the same time, the draft reward regulations were adopted, and fourteen outstanding advanced producers were rewarded. Respected Chairman Mao: We will use the practical action of striving to complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule to respond to your call at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to "strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation"!
            Wishing you good health.
        Sincerely, The First Workers' Congress of the Beijing Tram Company

    Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant Employees Report to Chairman Mao
    Eight-Month Vehicle Manufacturing Task Completed Ahead of Schedule – Strive to Complete Annual Task by September
    The full text of the letter from the employees of the Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant to Chairman Mao is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
    We, all the employees of the Beijing Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant, report to you with great enthusiasm: We have completed the task of manufacturing eighteen new vehicles in eight months of 1950, 65 days ahead of schedule. On June 25, the new vehicles we manufactured were all running on the streets of the capital.
    After liberation, our factory launched the first "Hundred Vehicle Movement" in preparation for welcoming the first "May 1st" Labor Day after liberation; because we relaxed our vigilance against hidden enemies, 58 vehicles were burned by special agents and bandits on April 24 last year. This further increased our resentment towards the enemy. Under the active leadership of the Party and the People's Government, we turned grief into strength and completed the second "Hundred Vehicle Movement" ahead of schedule when welcoming the October Revolution Day.
    Starting in 1950, production began to be carried out in a planned manner. Each of us has a clearer division of labor, set personal plans, and everyone strives to exceed the quota. The production plan for the first half of the year has been overfulfilled by 31.2%. In the work of January and February, Zhang Fulai exceeded the original plan by 120%, and Su Lanpo exceeded the original plan by 116%. The production plans for March and April were formulated according to the overfulfilled amount of January and February, but Su Lanpo exceeded by another 49.6%, and Fan Baoquan exceeded by 45.9%, so the production efficiency is increasing day by day. In particular, the workers used their brains and put forward 42 rationalization proposals from January to May. The trams, which were damaged by rain for more than 20 years, overcame the difficulty of driving in the rain by adding a resistance water deflector after everyone came up with ideas. The number of savings is also increasing day by day, saving a total of 100,450 jin of millet from January to May. It is under these circumstances that we completed the task of manufacturing eighteen new vehicles ahead of schedule.
    In order to welcome the birthday of our own Party and respond to the government's call, we are actively preparing to launch a new record movement for production and conservation. We have full confidence that through this movement, we will continue to improve production, continuously improve the management system, and achieve the goals of enterprise management and democratic management.
    We resolutely guarantee to you that, under your wise leadership, we will strive to complete the annual production task by September; and universally launch rationalization proposals to improve quality, meet specifications, and strive for the economic construction and industrialization of the motherland!
    Finally, wishing you good health!
      Respectfully, All Employees of the Beijing Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant
          June 26, 1950

　　京市电车公司第一届职工代表大会
    向毛主席报告生产成绩
    开展合理化建议创造新纪录迎接“七一”
    【本报讯】北京市电车公司第一届职工代表大会二十五日上书毛主席报告生产计划（大会消息见本报京市新闻栏）。该公司修造厂全体职工亦向毛主席报告已提前完成十八辆新机车，并坚决保证争取把全年任务提前到九月份完成。
    电车公司第一届职工代表大会给毛主席的信全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    在您英明的领导下，我们在本月二十四、二十五两天，召开了全体职工代表会，总结了一至五月份的工作。五个月来，我们完成了全年任务的百分之五十一；修造厂以五个月零二十五天，完成了八个月新造机车十八辆的生产计划。工人卢运泰建议，在电车上按装了挡水板，解决了多年来雨季行车的困难。变流厂修竣了存放七年来未能修好的水银整流器，解决了今后出车二百二十辆的供电问题。发电厂每度电的燃煤量亦在不断的降低，由一九四九年的一点五五公斤，降低到一点三六公斤。车路上实行了包车包路制，把日本和国民党反动统治时代几次试行失败了的环行路，胜利地走好了，在这次会上，决议以开展合理化建议、创造生产与节约的新纪录来迎接党的生日，并以此作为我们今后努力的方向。修造厂争取九个月完成全年生产任务。发电厂争取突破每度电燃煤一点一公斤的新纪录。车路争取创造安全行车一万公里的新纪录。同时通过了奖励条例草案，并奖励了十四位突出的先进生产者。敬爱的毛主席：我们要用争取提前完成全年生产计划的实际行动，响应您在三中全会上“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”的号召！
            祝您身体健康
        北京市电车公司第一届职工代表大会谨上
                一九五○年六月二十五日
    电车公司修造厂职工报告毛主席
    八个月造车任务提前完成  争取到九月完成全年任务
    电车公司修造厂职工给毛主席的信全文如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们北京市电车公司修造厂的全体职工，以万分的热情向您报告：我们已把一九五○年八个月造新车十八辆的任务，提前六十五天完成。六月二十五日，我们所造的新车，已全部行驶在首都的街头了。
    解放后，我们工厂就展开了第一次百辆车运动，准备迎接解放后第一个“五一”劳动节；因为我们放松了对隐蔽敌人的警惕，以致在去年四月二十四日被特务匪徒烧毁了五十八辆车。这更加重了我们对敌人的愤恨。在党和人民政府积极的领导下，我们把悲愤变成了力量，在迎接十月革命节的时候，提前完成了第二次百辆车运动。
    一九五○年起，生产有计划的开展起来了。我们每人都有了比较明确的分工，定出个人计划，人人争取做到超额。上半年生产计划已超额完成百分之三十一点二。一、二月份的工作中，张福来超过原计划百分之一百二十，苏兰坡超过原计划百分之一百一十六。三、四月份的生产计划是按一、二月份超额完成量制定的，但苏兰坡又超过百分之四十九点六，范宝泉超过百分之四十五点九，生产效率因此就一天一天的提高。特别是工友们开动脑筋，一月至五月提出了四十二件合理化建议。二十多年来下雨就坏的电车，经过大家想法子，增设了阻力挡水板，克服下雨行车的困难。节约数字也一天天的增加，一月至五月共节约小米十万零四千四百五十斤。我们就是在这种情况下，提前完成了十八辆新车的任务。
    为了迎接自己党的生日，响应政府号召，我们正积极地准备开展生产节约的新纪录运动。我们有充分的信心通过这一运动把生产继续提高，把管理制度不断的改进，达到经营企业化和管理民主化的目的。
    我们向您坚决保证，在您英明的领导下，争取把全年生产任务提前到九月份完成；并普遍展开合理化建议，做到提高质量，合乎规格，努力为祖国的经济建设与工业化而奋斗！
    最后，祝您身体健康！
      北京市电车公司修造厂全体职工鞠躬
          一九五○年六月二十六日
