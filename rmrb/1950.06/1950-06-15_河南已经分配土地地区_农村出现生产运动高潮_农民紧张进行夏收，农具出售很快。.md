Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 6th: A production upsurge is emerging in rural areas of Henan Province where land has been distributed. Under the call of the local people's government to vigorously develop production and get rich through labor, and with specific and timely organizational leadership, the broad masses of farmers are joyously engaged in production. In the Luoyang Special District, because land reform has been largely completed, this year's spring plowing plan has not only been fully completed but also greatly exceeded. According to statistics, farmers in the district have newly reclaimed more than 12,000 mu of wasteland this spring, repaired more than 28,000 mu of beach land, built five new irrigation canals, and planted 631,712 mu of cotton, an increase of more than 177,000 mu compared with last year, exceeding the original plan by more than 87,000 mu. The early autumn crops in the district have all been sown, and multiple hoeing and fertilization have been universally carried out. Production mutual aid organizations have also been restored and developed. In the past, the "team plowing groups" in the mountainous areas of the district have all been restored, and new production mutual aid groups are also being organized. The above situation has also appeared in Nanyang, Xinyang, Xuchang and other special districts. In Xuchang Special District, the newly liberated poor and hired farmers are all vying to buy draft animals and farm implements, and are actively engaged in labor production. According to some incomplete statistics in Xiangcheng County of the special district, 91 townships in the county have increased by 1,749 head of livestock after the completion of land reform; farmers in 62 townships have added 240 carts and more than 1,400 pieces of agricultural implements. In Juling Township, Lin颍 County, less than a month after the distribution of land, farmers have newly purchased more than 60 head of draft animals. In these areas, landlords, after receiving the same share of land as the farmers, have also taken out their original hidden assets to buy livestock and farm implements. For example, according to statistics in the first district of Suiping County in Xinyang Special District, landlords and rich peasants bought more than 80 head of draft animals after land reform. This phenomenon is even more common in Luoyang Special District. Therefore, blacksmiths and carpenters in rural areas are particularly busy, and the agricultural implements they make cannot meet the needs of the vast number of farmers. At the "Xiaoman Fair" held in various places as usual, there are a large number of agricultural implements, vehicles, draft animals, and grains on the market. The fair is filled with goods and crowded with people; the amount of transactions and the speed of sales are unprecedented in the past ten years.

The upsurge of the production movement in these areas that have completed land reform is now being pushed towards the summer harvest. Since late May, men and women, young and old, in rural areas everywhere have gone to the fields to harvest wheat. In Xuchang Special District, four million liberated farmers have harvested all of the more than two million mu of barley, and wheat is also being harvested. On the vast Henan Plain, a new scene of celebrating the harvest is everywhere.

After the completion of land reform, local people's governments immediately publicized the production policy to the broad masses of farmers through people's representatives conferences and farmers' representatives conferences, and strengthened the leadership of rural production in a timely manner, which played a great role in the development of the production movement. The concept of getting rich through labor has been well known in these areas, and the production enthusiasm of all strata in rural areas is very stable. The people's government has also effectively solved the difficulties of farmers in production, such as agricultural implements and seeds, through a large number of loans and the organization of mutual adjustment among the masses, which has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the farmers.

　　河南已经分配土地地区  农村出现生产运动高潮
    农民紧张进行夏收，农具出售很快。
    【新华社开封六日电】在河南省部分已分配土地地区的农村中，正出现着一个生产运动的高潮。广大农民群众在当地人民政府大力发展生产、劳动发家的号召和具体及时的组织领导之下，无不欢天喜地地进行生产。洛阳专区由于土地改革已大部完成，今年的春耕计划不仅全部完成且大大超过。据统计，该专区农民今春即新开荒地一万二千余亩，修出滩地二万八千余亩，增修灌溉渠道五条，植棉六十三万一千七百十二亩，比去年增加十七万七千余亩，超过原计划八万七千余亩。该区早秋作物早已全部下种，并普遍做到了多锄多上粪。生产互助组织也随着恢复和发展起来，过去该区山地的“趟耩班子”已全部恢复起来，新的生产互助组亦正在组织中。上述的情形也出现于南阳、信阳、许昌等专区。在许昌专区，新翻身的贫、雇农民都争买耕畜、农具，积极劳动生产。据该专区襄城县的一些不完全统计，该县有九十一个乡在土地改革完成后增加了牲口一千七百四十九头；六十二个乡农民添置了大车二百四十辆、农具一千四百余件。临颍县巨陵乡分配土地不及一月，农民已新买耕畜六十余头。这些地区的地主在分得和农民同样的一份土地后，也纷纷拿出原有的浮财底产购买牲口和农具。如信阳专区遂平县一区统计：土地改革后地主富农买的耕畜即达八十余头。在洛阳专区，这种现象更是普遍。因此农村的铁匠木匠们就特别忙碌起来，他们所制造出来的农具已供不上广大农民的需要。各地按照常例所举行的“小满会”上，农具、车辆、耕畜、粮食等上市极多，会场货物堆积，人群熙攘；其成交之多、销售之快，为十数年来所仅见。
    这些已完成了土地改革地区的生产运动的高潮，现正推向夏收。自五月下旬开始，各地农村中的男女老少无不下地收麦。许昌专区四百万翻身农民已将二百余万亩大麦全部收割完毕，小麦亦正开镰。在广阔无边的河南平原上，到处呈现着一副欢庆丰收的新景象。
    土地改革完成后，各地人民政府曾立即通过各界人民代表会、农民代表会等向广大农民宣传生产政策，并及时加强对农村生产的领导，这对生产运动的开展起了极大的作用。劳动发家的观念在这些地区已家喻户晓，农村各阶层生产情绪都很安定。人民政府又以大量贷款和组织群众间的互相调剂等办法，有效地解决了农民在生产中所发生的农具、种子等困难，更大大鼓舞了农民群众的生产热情。
