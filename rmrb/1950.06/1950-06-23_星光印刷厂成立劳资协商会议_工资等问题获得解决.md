　　Xingguang Printing Factory Establishes Labor-Management Consultation Meeting
    Wage and Other Issues Resolved
    [This newspaper reported] The privately-owned Xingguang Printing Factory in the First District of Beijing established a labor-management consultation meeting on May 26th, resolving existing issues within the factory concerning wages, working hours, and more. Labor-management relations have taken on a new atmosphere, and both sides are striving to develop production. The factory's employees are all from Shanghai, where wage levels are higher than in Beijing. When the employees came to Beijing, they had higher expectations for wages. However, during the factory's construction, the workers demonstrated great enthusiasm, voluntarily laying concrete floors and installing machinery, saving the capitalist 4 million yuan. The capitalist also focused on production, spending nearly 150,000 jin of millet to move all the factory's machinery and equipment, as well as the labor force, north.

    After officially starting operations in May, business was relatively slow. When salaries were paid in the middle of the month, the capitalist did not adequately consult with the trade union and unilaterally reduced the originally agreed-upon monthly wages, causing dissatisfaction among the workers. Later, through methods such as general meetings, group meetings, and labor-management discussion meetings, and after ideological mobilization, the current difficulties of industry and commerce were analyzed. The workers abandoned their excessive demands, and the capitalist also resolved concerns that excessive demands from workers would affect the factory's development. Both sides were willing to establish a labor-management consultation meeting based on joint cooperation.

    The first meeting determined that monthly wages would be reduced by 20 jin of millet from the original 400-450 jin of millet; agreements were also reached on other issues such as piecework wages, holidays, machine repairs, and subsidies for the number of typesetting plates. After the meeting, the capitalist announced plans to add a typesetting workshop, and that the factory had agreed with Sanlian Bookstore in June to print 1,200 reams of books and magazines. The factory's labor-management consultation meeting is now scheduled to be held every half month.

　　星光印刷厂成立劳资协商会议
    工资等问题获得解决
    【本报讯】京市第一区私营星光印刷厂，于五月二十六日成立了劳资协商会议，解决了该厂现存的工资、工时等问题，劳资关系有了新的气象，双方正努力发展生产。该厂职工均系由上海迁来，上海工资待遇较北京为高，职工来京时曾对工资有较高要求。但在建厂中，工人曾以高度的劳动热忱，自动打洋灰地，按装机器，为资方节约了四百万元。资方亦能从生产出发，化了近十五万斤小米，将全厂机器设备及人工北移。
    五月正式开工后，生意较为清淡。月中发薪时，资方未曾与工会很好协商，即将原定月工工资数降低，引起工人不满，后经采取大会、小组会及劳资座谈会等方式，经过思想动员，分析了目前工商业困难情况，劳方放弃了过高要求，资方也解决了怕工人过高要求影响工厂发展的顾虑。双方愿在共同协力的基础上，成立劳资协商会。
    首次会议确定月工工资从原定四百——四百五十斤小米各减二十斤；其他如件工工资、例假休息、机器修理、装版多寡津贴等问题，也取得了协议。会后资方宣布添设排字房的计划，及六月份该厂已与三联书店商妥承印一千二百令书籍杂志等事项。现该厂劳资协商会议定每半月召开一次。
