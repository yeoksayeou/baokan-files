Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: Special Invited Guest Gentry Li Genyuan’s full speech at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference on June 21st is as follows: Chairman, esteemed members, ladies and gentlemen:

　　I am very happy to have this opportunity to attend this grand meeting of the National Committee. Since the Anti-Japanese War, I have been in poor health for several years, resting in the mountains and forests, living in seclusion. This time, General Liu Bocheng forwarded me the telegram from Beijing, sent by Generals Chen Geng and Zhou Baozhong, asking me to come out. At that time, my stomach was not good, and I was afraid of flying, so some friends advised me not to come. But I saw that after the establishment of our new government, in a very short period of time, it has made many remarkable achievements in economic, political, and cultural construction, which shows that the Chinese people have infinitely bright and promising future. I felt that even if it was just to express my congratulations to the people, I should make this trip. My wife also advised me, saying that as long as people know that Li Genyuan is in Beijing, that would be enough. Therefore, despite my old age and ill health, I struggled to come to Beijing. After arriving in Beijing, I met Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and other leaders. Their sincere and humble attitude, and their loyalty to serving the people, made me very happy and admired. Since participating in the meeting, I have also seen representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations across the country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, with a spirit of unity, jointly seeking to eliminate the reactionary forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. The atmosphere of the meeting shows that our country will be very prosperous, and our people will receive immense happiness. This is also very inspiring to me. At the meeting, I heard Vice Chairman Liu's report on land reform, Vice Premier Chen's report on finance and economy, Premier Zhou's political report, Acting Chief of General Staff Nie's military report, and Vice Premier Guo and President Shen's report on cultural education and judicial work. These reports further systematically and correctly solved the problems of various aspects of the construction of the new China, and I admire them very much. I think the most important thing is Vice Chairman Liu's report on land reform. This report explained the principles and methods of carrying out land reform in a guided and orderly manner, so that the Chinese people can smoothly overthrow the unreasonable feudal system that has existed for thousands of years, eliminate the root causes of their poverty, backwardness, oppression, and aggression, and lay a solid foundation for the country's democratization, industrialization, independence, unification, and prosperity. We should resolutely support this report. Secondly, what moved me the most and what I admired the most was Premier Zhou's report on diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. I remember when Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, I was recuperating at Anning Hot Springs in Yunnan. The newspaper carrying the news happened to be received on New Year's Eve, when we were eating New Year's Eve dinner. At that time, I was so happy that I shouted wildly. I was originally forbidden to drink alcohol, but at this time I led my whole family to drink a toast and wrote four lines of poetry as proof. These four lines of poetry are: "Suffered a hundred years of unequal treaties, equality given to me by the Soviet Union; news of the Sino-Soviet treaty signing reported, the old man happily drinks a toast." This poem was copied everywhere in Yunnan, because this treaty is an unprecedented initiative in China's foreign relations since its existence. China's unification, independence, well-being, and world peace will all be based on this treaty, so the significance of signing this treaty is incalculable, and it is also something that I admire very much. In short, at this meeting, I saw that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, have already made many great undertakings that have turned the world upside down and shaken the past and the present. Therefore, I want to warmly celebrate the success of the people's great cause led by Chairman Mao.

　　特邀列席绅耆
    李根源的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】绅耆李根源二十一日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    我这次有机会来参加全国委员会的这个盛会，是非常高兴的。自从抗战以后，几年中间我身体不好，休息山林，过着隐居的生活。这次刘伯承将军转给我北京的电报，由陈赓、周保中两将军送来，叫我出来。我当时肠胃又不好，又怕坐飞机，有些朋友就劝我不要来。但是我看到我们新的政府成立以后，在很短的时间内，已经在经济、政治、文化，各方面的建设工作中，做出了许多显著的成绩，这就表示中国人民有了无限光明远大的前途。我觉得就是单单为了表示一下对人民庆祝的意思，也应该来走一趟。我的内人也劝我说，只要让人家知道李根源在北京就可以了。因此，我不顾年老，和有病的身体，奋力来到北京。到京以后，会见了毛主席朱总司令，以及各位领袖，他们诚恳谦逊的态度，以及为人民服务的一片忠心，使我非常愉快，非常佩服。参加会议以来，又看到全国各民主党派，各人民团体的代表，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下面，以团结一致的精神，共同来图谋肃清帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动势力。会议的气象，表示我们的国家，将要十分的兴旺起来，我们的人民，将要得到莫大的幸福。这也是使我非常感奋的。在会上听到刘副主席的土地改革报告，陈副总理的财政经济报告，周总理的政治报告，聂代总参谋长的军事报告，以及郭副总理沈院长的文化教育及司法工作报告。这些报告，进一步有系统的正确的解决了新中国的各方面建设的问题，我都非常佩服。我认为最重要的，第一是刘副主席的土地改革的报告。这个报告，说明了有领导有秩序的进行土地改革的方针和办法，使中国人民能够顺利去推翻几千年来不合理的封建制度，解除自己的穷困，落后，被压迫，被侵略的根本原因，打好国家民主化，工业化，独立，统一和富强的基础。我们应该坚决拥护这个报告。其次，使我最感动，最佩服的，是周总理报告的对苏联的外交关系。我记得毛主席周总理订立中苏友好同盟条约的时候我正在云南安宁温泉休养。登载这个消息的报纸，恰好是在除夕，我们吃年夜饭的时候接到的。我当时真是高兴得狂呼大叫。我本来禁喝酒，这时率领全家喝干一杯，并写了四句诗作证。这四句诗是：“百年受尽不平等，平等交我苏维埃；报到中苏约签字，老夫欢喜喝干杯。”这首诗在云南到处传抄，因为这个条约，是中国自有外交以来，空前的创举。中国的统一、独立、康乐以及世界和平，都要奠定在这个条约上，所以订立这条约的意义之重大，是不可计算的，也是使我非常佩服的。总之，在这个会议上，我看见中国的人民，在毛主席领导下面，已做出了许多翻天覆地震古烁今的伟大事业，因此我要热烈庆祝毛主席领导的人民大业的成功。
