　　Valuing Workers' Life Safety
    Zhangjiakou City Strengthens Safety and Health Work
    [Our Report from Zhangjiakou] Since early April, when the Zhangjiakou Municipal Labor Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions conveyed the spirit and instructions of the National Labor Bureau Chiefs Conference, leading cadres of state-owned factories and the Telecommunications Bureau in Zhangjiakou have further clarified the viewpoint of "valuing people." They have collaborated with the trade unions to formulate safety and health plans and improve labor protection work.
    Regarding safety equipment: The Chahar Daily Printing Factory has added safety boxes to the electrical switches to prevent electric shock. The Vegetable Oil Factory has also added railings to dangerous areas such as main shafts and belt pulleys. Regarding adjusting working hours: The Alcohol Factory and the Vegetable Oil Factory have both established a three-shift system with eight-hour workdays. Regarding daily hygiene: All factories have repaired toilets and assigned dedicated personnel to clean them. Cleaning systems have also been established for workshops, factories, and courtyards. Spittoons have been added, garbage bins have been placed, and family members have been mobilized to clean dormitories. Washbasins and towels have been provided in the work areas. Dust masks have been issued to work departments with dust or hazards to health. Regarding diet: All factories have paid attention to providing workers with sufficient boiled water. The Transportation Company has added a boiler, and the Alcohol Factory ensures that each person has a bowl. All factories have equipped stoves or steamers for employees to heat meals. The Cigarette Factory, Vegetable Oil Factory, Alcohol Factory, and Rubber Factory have all repaired bathhouses. Medical equipment in various factories is also being actively improved.
    Experience from strengthening labor protection work over the past two months has proven that to do a good job in factory safety and health, leaders must first attach importance to it and regularly put factory safety and health work on the agenda of the management committee for discussion and research. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate workers, mobilize workers and their families to take action, and cultivate hygienic habits. It is also necessary to concentrate the opinions, requirements, and wisdom of the workers to improve equipment. Only in this way can problems be solved practically.

　　重视工人生命安全
    张市加强安全卫生工作
    【本报张家口讯】张家口市省营各厂及电信局等单位，自四月初市府劳动局及市工会联合传达了全国劳动局长会议的精神与指示后，各单位领导干部进一步明确了“重视人”的观点，协同工会作了安全卫生计划，改进劳动保护工作。
    在安全设备方面：察哈尔日报印刷厂电闸上已加了保险箱，以防触电；植物油厂亦在大轴、皮带轮等危险处增添了栏杆。在调整工时方面：酒精厂和植物油厂都已建立了每日工作八小时的三班制。在日常卫生方面：各厂都修理了厕所，并设专人打扫清洁；车间、厂、院也建立了清扫制度，增加痰盂，添置垃圾箱，并动员家属打扫宿舍；工作间设备了脸盆、毛巾；有尘土或有害身体健康的工作部门都发了口罩。在饮食方面：各厂都注意到供给工人足够的开水，运输公司添设了一个锅炉，酒精厂做到每人一个碗；各厂均已为职工设备了热饭的炉灶或蒸笼。纸烟厂、植物油厂、酒精厂和橡胶厂都修好了浴室。各厂医药设备方面也正在积极改进中。
    从两个多月来加强劳保工作的经验证明：要作好工厂安全卫生工作，首先是领导干部要重视，把工厂安全卫生工作经常提到管委会的议事日程上去讨论研究；同时也要教育工人，发动工人和家属大家动手，养成卫生习惯；并且要集中工人群众的意见、要求和智慧，来改进设备。只有这样，才会切合实际的解决问题。（葛兰、张文明、徐淑敏）
