　　CPC Leting County Committee Directs District Committees to Mobilize Private Soil Salt Boilers to Change Professions
　　[Our Newspaper] During the sideline production upsurge last winter in Leting County, Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, the masses in the coastal areas of the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Districts extensively boiled saltpeter. Since spring, due to the small amount of saltpeter, some disaster-stricken people switched to boiling salt, with 726 households in the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Districts alone. However, since the provincial government issued an order to control local salt, to avoid affecting the state's salt tax revenue, the CPC Leting County Committee has issued three instructions to the district committees, mobilizing private salt boilers to change professions or register. By the middle of last month, the number had been reduced from more than 700 households to more than 200, with most switching to sideline occupations such as picking fish.

　　中共乐亭县委指示各区委
    动员私熬土盐户转业
    【本报讯】河北省唐山专区乐亭县在去冬副业生产热潮中，沿海一带二、三、四、五、九区群众大量熬制皮硝。入春以来因硝量过少，便有一部分灾民转为熬盐，仅二、四、五、九区即有七百二十六户。但自省府通令管制土盐，免致影响国家盐税收入后，中共乐亭县委即三次指示各区委，动员私熬盐户转业或进行登记，至上月中已由七百余户减至二百余户，大部分转入挑鱼等副业。
