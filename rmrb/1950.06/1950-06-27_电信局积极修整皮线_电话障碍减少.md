　　Telecom Bureau Actively Repairs Drop Wires
    Telephone Outages Reduced
    [This newspaper reported] Since the Beijing Telecom Bureau's Line Section merged the installation and removal team with the Mechanical Section's troubleshooting team to form a maintenance team in early April, unifying the city's telephone troubleshooting, installation, and removal work, it has not only saved some manpower but also increased work efficiency by more than 80%. Currently, over 70% of users' drop wires in the city have been thoroughly repaired, telephone outages have been reduced, and repair time has been greatly shortened. After the establishment of the bureau's maintenance team, the Fourth Branch Maintenance Team first learned the methods of the Lüda Telecom Bureau, which cooperated with the measuring station and took responsibility for specific areas, shortening the time to repair telephone outages. Other branch maintenance teams also implemented this successively. In early May, at the inaugural meeting of the Enterprise Management Committee Branch of the bureau's Line Section, the Fourth Branch proposed a friendly challenge competition to the maintenance teams of each branch with the slogan "Complete the task of repairing users' drop wires before the rainy season and ensure that the repair time does not exceed 60 minutes." This was met with a response from each team, and the bureau's trade union formed a competition committee to lead the competition. During the competition, everyone demonstrated a high level of work enthusiasm. The workers of the Fourth Bureau were able to repair the drop wires of more than 20 users per day. Su Fuyao of the Seventh Bureau proposed the "three clears" method of "reporting forms must be clear, work orders must be clear, and materials and tools must be clear," and so on. As of the end of last month, more than 70% of users' drop wires in the city had been repaired, and user call outages had been greatly reduced. In the past, every branch would have more than 200 telephones out of service every time it rained. During the heavy rain on the night of May 29, the number of users experiencing outages would have exceeded 1,000 in the past, but this time less than 100 users experienced outages. The repair situation is also completely different. In the past, it took two or three days to repair each telephone; now it only takes about 60 minutes, and the fastest only takes 10 minutes.

　　电信局积极修整皮线
    电话障碍减少
    【本报讯】北京电信局线路科自四月初将装撤班与机械科的查修班合并组成维护班，统一了全市电话的查修装撤工作以来，除节省了部分人力外，并提高了工作效能百分之八十以上。现全市用户皮线经彻底整修的已超过百分之七十，电话障碍已减少，修复时间大大缩短。该局维护班成立以后，四分局维护班首先学习了旅大电信局与测量台配合工作、分区负责的方法，缩短了修复电话障碍的时间；其他各分局维护班亦相继实行。五月初旬，该局线路科企业管理委员会分会成立大会上，四分局以“完成雨季以前整修用户皮线任务及保证修复时间不超过六十分钟”的口号，向各分局维护班提出友谊挑战竞赛，得到各班响应，并由该局工会组成竞赛委员会领导竞赛。在竞赛中，大家都表现了高度的工作积极性，四局的工友每人每日均能整修二十余用户的皮线，七分局的苏福尧提出“报告表要清、派工单要清、材料工具要清”的“三清”办法等。截至上月底止，全市用户皮线经整修的已有百分之七十以上，用户通话障碍大量减少。过去每逢下雨每一分局都要有二百多户电话发生障碍，五月二十九日夜间大雨，若在以前发生障碍的用户定要过千，但此次不足百户发生障碍。修复的情形也完全不同，过去每一个电话，有需要两三天修复的，现在只需六十分钟左右，最快的只要十分钟。
