　　Beijing Grain Company Supports Private Grain Merchants, Increases Delivery Stations and Consignment Shops

　　[Reported by this newspaper] To facilitate grain purchases by merchants, the Beijing Grain Company recently increased the number of delivery stations and consignment shops.

　　In the past, the company sold grain by displaying samples in the market. Merchants, after inspecting the samples, would first pay at the bank, then complete procedures at the company, and finally go to the warehouse to pick up the goods, which was time-consuming. Now, to address the difficulties faced by merchants and save time, the company has set up an additional delivery station near the market, stipulating that those purchasing less than 3,000 jin of grain can pay and pick up the goods at the delivery station immediately. Since the establishment of this station, merchants have found it very convenient. The company's daily sales in the market have now increased three to four times compared to before.

　　Furthermore, to support the private grain shop industry, the company has signed consignment contracts with twelve private grain merchants. It is stipulated that each grain shop will receive a commission of one and a half jin per hundred jin of coarse grains sold on consignment, and one jin per hundred jin of fine grains. Consignment sales have now begun. Each shop can sell 10,000 to 30,000 jin per day.

　　北京粮食公司扶植私营粮商
    增设付货栈及代销店
    【本报讯】北京市粮食公司为便利商人购粮，最近增设了付货栈及代销店。
    该公司过去是拿粮样在市场出售的。商人看准粮样后，先到银行交款，再到公司办理手续后，才能赴仓库提货，以致往返费时。现为解决商人的困难与节省时间起见，该公司特在市场附近增设付货栈一处，规定购粮数量在三千斤以内者，均可当时到付货栈交款提货。该栈增设以来，商人均感便利。该公司每天在市场上的销售量，现已较前增多三、四倍。
    又，该公司为了扶植私人粮栈业，该公司已与十二家私营粮商订立了代销合同。规定各粮栈每代销粗粮一百斤提手续费一斤半，细粮一百斤提手续费一斤。现已开始代销。每日每家可销一万斤至三万斤。
