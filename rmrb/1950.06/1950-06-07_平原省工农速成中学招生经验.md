　　Experiences in Recruiting Students for the Pingyuan Province Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School

  I. Recruitment Process
    Pingyuan Province established a Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School, with three classes and a total of one hundred and twenty students for this term.

    On April 3rd, the Provincial Government notified the Military Region, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and the Special Commissioner's Offices and Municipal Governments to recommend students for the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School. However, the recommended students did not arrive completely by the scheduled examination date, so it was temporarily changed to a batch examination. Sixty people participated in the first examination, and twenty-six were admitted; in the second examination, sixteen were admitted out of forty-six; finally, a third examination was held separately at the Provincial Party School, the Provincial Government Cadre School, and the Security Department Cadre School, with one hundred and twenty people taking the test, and seventy-eight were admitted.
  II. Students' Cultural Level and Learning Enthusiasm
    The exam questions this time were easier than those of ordinary middle schools; the standard for calculating scores was also relatively lenient. Generally, those with an average score of 35 or higher in Chinese and arithmetic were mostly admitted. However, the number of people who failed was still greater than the number of those admitted.

    While grading the test papers, the teachers appropriately considered the students' age, work history, family situation, and future prospects. For example, one student scored 55 in arithmetic but only 13 in Chinese. Later, during the oral examination, it was discovered that his reading ability far exceeded his writing ability, so it was decided to admit him.

    The vast majority of cadres who were recommended had an urgent desire to learn. For example, Comrades Wei Dongyuan and Feng Suqing from Anyang City were very anxious before the results were announced. They said, "If we cannot be admitted, can the school ask us to pay our own money and be auditors here?" Liu Jisheng from the Anyang Special Commissioner's Office said, "If I am not accepted, it is okay for me to be a worker or do half-work and half-study here." Wu Chunying and others from the Military Region Political Department wrote to comrades outside after being admitted: "I never dreamed that I could study in such a good school. I hope you hurry up and prepare your lessons and strive to be admitted in the next enrollment."
  III. Several Lessons

    This time, due to insufficient publicity about the significance of the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School in advance and poor contact with various parties, some units recommended students who did not meet the specified conditions. Some units issued "insurance tickets" to students, intentionally or unintentionally concealing the matter of the entrance examination. The Education Section of the Xinxiang Special Commissioner's Office even kept the enrollment notice issued by the Provincial Government in the archives until long after the examination deadline, and only conveyed it after the Provincial Government inquired. Five people (the original quota was ten) were sent temporarily for the second examination, and only one was admitted after the examination.

    Some leading comrades in some units were reluctant to transfer outstanding cadres with more than three years of work history, or delayed the transfer, or transferred cadres with lower levels to fill the numbers.

    Many comrades do not have enough understanding of the Workers and Peasants School, and therefore are dissatisfied with the examination, believing that since it is a Workers and Peasants School, it is not necessary to examine so seriously.

    There were also individual students who were unwilling to study themselves, and the leadership recommended them before doing a good job of mobilization. As a result, in the examination, some people erased the arithmetic problems they had answered correctly, hoping to fail and return.

    In addition, the time allotted for this enrollment was quite rushed. The notice was issued on the 3rd, and the students were required to arrive completely by the 15th. After receiving the notice, a unit needs to conduct full discussions, research, publicity, mobilization, and student selection. The recommended cadres inevitably have official and private matters to explain and take care of before leaving. It is not easy to do well within such a short period. This also increased the difficulty of this enrollment. Therefore, the examination was repeatedly postponed, and finally, the students were only recruited from the three cadre schools.

　　平原省工农速成中学招生经验
    本报通讯员  刘定一
  一、招生经过
    平原省创办了一所工农速成中学，本期招生三班，共一百二十名。
    四月三日，省府通知军区、省工会、各专署和市政府保送工农速成中学的学生，但到了预定考期，保送学员仍未到齐，只好临时改为分批考试。第一次考试六十人参加，录取了二十六人；第二次考试，在四十六人中录取了十六名；最后，又在省委党校、省府干校和保安厅干校分别举行了第三次考试，一百二十人应试，录取了七十八人。
  二、学生的文化水平与学习情绪
    这次考试的题目，比普通中学都容易些；计算分数的标准也比较宽。一般国语算术平均在三十五分以上的大部都录取了。但落榜的人数还是多于取录的人数。
    教员们评阅试卷中，都适当地考虑了学生的年龄、工作历史、家庭情况、培养前途等。例如有一位学生的算术得了五十五分，而国语只十三分，后来在口试时发现了他的阅读能力远远超过写作能力，也就决定把他录取了。
    绝大多数被保送来的干部，都有迫切的学习要求。如安阳市韦东元、冯素清等同志，在未发榜之前十分焦虑。他们说：“如果不能录取，学校能叫我们自己拿出钱来，在这里当个旁听生也行。”安阳专署刘吉生说：“取不上叫我在这里当个工友、半工半读也好。”军区政治部吴春英等在录取之后给外边同志写信说：“作梦也想不到，我能在这样好的学校里上学了。希望你们赶紧预备功课，争取下次招生时给录取上。”
  三、几点教训
    这次招生，由于事先对工农速成中学的意义宣传不够，与各方面的联系也很差，因之，某些单位保送的学生不够规定的条件。有的单位对学生开“保险票”，有意无意地把入学考试的事掩盖不说。新乡专署教育科，竟至把省府发出的招生通知押在档案里，直到考试期限过了很久，经省府催问后才把它传达下去，在第二次考试时临时送来五人（原配额是十名），经考试只录取了一名。
    有的单位的领导同志，对抽调有三年以上工作历史的优秀干部有些“舍不得”，或者拖延不调，或者调些水平较低的来充数。
    有很多同志对工农学校的认识不够，因而对考试不满，认为既然是工农学校，就不必考得那么认真。
    还有个别学员自己不愿来学习，领导上未作好好的动员就把他保送来了。以至在考试中，有人把答对了的算术题又涂掉，希望落第回去。
    此外，这次招生时间规定得相当仓促。三号发通知，十五号就要学生到齐。一个单位接到通知后要作充分的讨论、研究、宣传、动员、选择学生等工作，被保送的干部动身前免不了还有公事、私事需要交代料理，在这样短促时期内是不容易办好的。这也增加了这次招生的困难。因之考试一再延期，最后还是在三个干部学校中才把学生招足的。
