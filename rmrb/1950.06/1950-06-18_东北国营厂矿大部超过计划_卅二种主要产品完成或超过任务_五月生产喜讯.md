Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th. Most of the products manufactured by state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China in May were completed and exceeded planned targets; product quality has also generally improved. According to statistics from the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government, thirty-two of the forty-three major products were completed or exceeded the plan. The production of electric motors, which had not met the plan in April, also exceeded the plan by 132.3% for standard products in May. However, due to many shortcomings and difficulties in raw material supply and operating technology, eleven major products from some factories and mines did not meet planned targets. For example, the production of transformers by the Electrical Industry Bureau was affected by incorrectly drawn blueprints, and only 72.3% of the plan was completed.

A characteristic of production in May was the general emphasis on quality improvement in all units. For example, the pig iron produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company has basically eliminated the previously serious "off-grade iron" (pig iron that does not meet steelmaking and casting standards). The problem of the poor quality of light bulbs from the Electrical Industry Administration, which had not been resolved for a long time, also showed significant improvement this month.

　　东北国营厂矿大部超过计划
    卅二种主要产品完成或超过任务
    五月生产喜讯
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】东北国营厂矿五月份所制产品，大部分完成并超过了计划；质量亦普遍提高。据东北人民政府工业部统计：在四十三种主要产品中，有三十二种完成与超过计划。四月份未完成计划的电动机生产，五月份的标准品亦超过计划百分之一百三十二点三。但有的厂矿因在原材料供应和操作技术上存在许多缺点和困难，致有十一种主要产品未完成计划。如电器工业局的变压器生产，即因图纸绘错而影响了工作的进度，仅完成计划百分之七十二点三。
    五月份生产的特点，是各单位普遍重视了质量的改进。如鞍山钢铁公司生产的生铁，已基本上消灭了过去严重存在的“号外铁”（不合炼钢和铸造标准的生铁）。很久未获解决的电器工业管理局灯泡质量不高的问题，本月也有显著改进。
