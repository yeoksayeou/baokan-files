　　New Trolleybuses to Run in Time for "July 1st"
    Trolleybus Company Completes Annual New Trolleybus Production Task Ahead of Schedule
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Trolleybus Repair and Manufacturing Factory, in celebration of "July 1st," has completed its annual new trolleybus production task ahead of schedule. The factory's annual production task was to build eighteen new trolleybuses, overhaul twenty-four trolleybuses, and perform intermediate repairs on twenty-four trolleybuses. The original plan was to complete the new trolleybus production by the end of August. However, due to the active work of all teams and monthly over-fulfillment, the original plan was completed by the end of June, ensuring that all new trolleybuses would be running by "July 1st." In addition, the original plan was to complete the overhaul of three motor vehicles and three trailers by the end of June. Due to actual needs, the plan was changed, and two motor vehicles and two trailers have been overhauled, and two new trailers have been built. Intermediate repairs on one vehicle and the construction of three new trailers will begin soon. The annual plan is to build ten more trailers than originally planned. The reasons for achieving such results are as follows:

    Planning together from top to bottom provides a clear goal. In the past, the production of the repair and manufacturing factory was chaotic, doing whatever came along without a specific plan. Beginning in 1950, the Municipal Bureau of Industry made a request to the factory: to go from losing money to making money. How could this be guaranteed? The administrative side of the factory first divided the annual task into six stages, each lasting two months, and developed a two-month production plan; it also clearly divided the work of each team and presented the plan to the workshops for discussion. At the same time, each team and individual also developed specific plans. Because the production tasks were clear, most workers exceeded their plans. During production in January and February, carpenter Zhang Fulai exceeded his original plan by 120%, Su Lanpo exceeded it by 116%, and the collective of foundry workers exceeded it by 42%. The production tasks for March and April were based on the working hours completed in January and February, but carpenter Su Lanpo exceeded them again by 49%, and blacksmith Fan Baoquan exceeded them by 45%.

    Implementing an over-achievement reward system consolidates production enthusiasm. In 1949, there was no reward system, and the production enthusiasm of employees fluctuated. This year, an over-achievement reward system was established. After the rewards were introduced, everyone's production enthusiasm was even more encouraged. For example, Liu Mengxing actively researched and improved four types of tools, each of which increased production by six to seven times. In particular, the red flag competition further encouraged the production enthusiasm of employees. After the foundry team won the "Production Champion" red flag in January and February, they often worked continuously during lunch breaks to ensure that the red flag was not taken away by other teams. They also switched to using continuous molds, which saved time, and won the red flag again in March and April. In January and February, Guo Jin's two carriage assembly teams won the red flag for an average monthly vehicle availability of 95%. The two teams retained the red flag in March and April. Through the red flag competition, not only was work efficiency improved, but also a lot of materials were saved.

    Organizing a core group to focus on production. In 1949, the Party and Youth League forces were weak, administrative plans were not thorough, the trade union focused more on administrative work, and the management committee members went to training classes, so there was no unified system. This year, the policy of "everything for production" was clarified. To remedy the aborted management committee, a core group of experienced master workers with the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League was organized to jointly study production plans and various systems. Employees consciously observed labor discipline, ensuring that they were not late, did not leave early, worked on time, and took care of machinery, which played a decisive role in improving production.

    Employees' awareness is raised, and they strive to save and continuously improve production. More importantly, employees' awareness has been raised. From January to mid-May this year, employees put forward a total of forty-two rationalization proposals of various sizes, including one invention (welding oil), thirteen rationalization proposals (resistance baffle, etc.), and twenty-eight technical improvements (modified oil baking, research on stewed meat, improved milling cutters, etc.). Other examples of saving and increasing production, such as the North Factory group setting a plan to save machine oil, foundry worker Ming Chunlin imitating the iron smelting furnace, carriage assembly and blacksmith teams utilizing scrap iron and screws, and Ma Kanfeng and Zhao Chongyou inventorying toolboxes and discovering a large number of parts, are too numerous to mention. Jin Guicai of the carriage assembly team said, "When we see a drop of oil on the ground, we really feel the pain in our hearts."

    Close cooperation between the repair and manufacturing factory and the trolleybus routes. Finally, and more importantly, there is close cooperation between the repair and manufacturing factory and the trolleybus routes. Trolleybus drivers implemented a duty responsibility system, and the repair and manufacturing factory also implemented a repair responsibility system, which greatly reduced the failure rate. This year, the failure rate (including loss of business and non-loss of business) was 15.5% in January, 14.75% in February, 11.65% in March, 12.69% in April, and 11.9% in May. The reduction in the failure rate played a certain auxiliary role in the repair and manufacturing factory completing its production plan ahead of schedule. (Peng Zhensui)

　　迎接“七一”行驶新车
    电车公司提前完成全年造新车任务
    【本报讯】北京电车修造厂迎接“七一”，提前完成全年造新车任务。该厂全年生产任务，为造新车十八辆，大修车二十四辆，中修车二十四辆。造新车计划原定八月底全部完成。由于各班积极工作，每月超额完成，使原计划可提前到六月底完成，保证在“七一”行驶全部新车。又原定六月底完成大修机、拖车各三辆，现因实际需要，改变计划，已大修机车二辆，大修拖车二辆，造新拖车两辆。最近将开始中修一部车，并再造新拖车三辆。全年准备比原计划多造拖车十辆。获得如此成绩的原因，有以下几点：
    上下一齐订计划，有了明确的奋斗目标。过去修造厂的生产是混乱的，来什么活做什么活，没有一定计划。一九五○年开始，市工业局向该厂提出要求：由赔钱做到赚钱。怎样保证呢？该厂行政方面首先把全年任务分做六个阶段，两个月一段，并制订了两个月的生产计划；又把各班明确分工，把计划交到车间讨论。同时，各班以及个人也都订出了具体计划。因为生产任务明确，大多数工人都超额完成了自己的计划。一、二月份生产中，案工张福来超过原定计划百分之一百二十，苏兰坡超过百分之一百一十六，铸工集体超过百分之四十二。三、四月份的生产任务是按一、二月份完成的工时订出的，但案工班苏兰坡又超过百分之四十九，锻工班范宝泉超过百分之四十五。
    实行超额奖励制度，巩固生产情绪。一九四九年中没有奖励制度，职工生产情绪就忽高忽低。今年制定了超额奖励办法。有了奖励以后，更鼓舞了大家的生产情绪。象刘梦星积极研究改良工具四种，每种都使生产提高六、七倍。尤其是争红旗竞赛，更鼓励职工的生产积极性。铸工班一、二月份夺得“生产冠军”的红旗以后，为了保证红旗不被别班夺走，中午吃饭时常不休息而连续工作。他们又改用了连环模子，节省了时间，三、四月份又夺得红旗。一、二月份架车班郭金两班以全月平均出车百分之九十五而夺得红旗。三、四月份两班又保住红旗。通过红旗竞赛，不但工作效率提高了，且节省了不少材料。
    组织核心小组，一致面向生产。一九四九年中，党、团力量薄弱，行政计划不周密，工会多注重事务工作，管委会委员到干训班学习，因此没有统一的制度。今年明确了“一切为了生产”的方针。为了补救流产的管委会，特组织了党、政、工、团与生产上有经验的老师傅的核心小组，共同研究生产计划及各种制度。职工自觉地遵守了劳动纪律，保证不迟到，不早退，按时工作，爱护机器等，对提高生产起了决定作用。
    职工觉悟提高，努力节约并不断改进生产。更重要的是职工觉悟提高了。今年一月至五月中，职工共提出大小合理化建议四十二种，计发明创造（焊油）一件，合理化建议（阻力挡水板等）十三件，技术改进（改制烤油、研究焖子、改良铣刀等）二十八件。其他像北厂小组定计划节省机器油，铸工明椿林仿造炼铁炉，架车班、锻工班利用废铁、螺丝，马堪峰、赵宠佑清点工具箱发现大批零件等节约增产事件不胜枚举。架车班金桂才说：“我们看见地上有一滴油，真从心里疼。”
    修造厂与车路密切配合。最后而又较重要的是，修造厂与车路之间的密切配合。车路司机实行了乘务负责制，修造厂也实行了检修负责制，因而坏车率大大降低。今年坏车率（包括损失营业与非损失营业）一月份百分之一五·五，二月份百分之一四·七五，三月份百分之一一·六五，四月份百分之一二·六九，五月份百分之一一·九。坏车率的降低，对修造厂提前完成生产计划起了一定的辅助作用。（彭振绥）
