　　Following Rejection of Proposal to Expel Kuomintang Representative
    Soviet Representative Withdraws from UN Trusteeship Council
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from New York] TASS, New York: The seventh session of the United Nations Trusteeship Council opened here on the 1st. At the beginning of the meeting, the Soviet representative, Mr. Tsarapkin, proposed to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang remnant clique from the council and demanded that the meeting recognize Mr. Meng Yongqian, appointed by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, as the representative to attend the meeting.
    When the Soviet representative's proposal was put to a vote, it was rejected by a vote of nine against, with the representatives of Britain and Argentina abstaining. After the vote, the Soviet representative withdrew from the meeting. The Soviet representative pointed out that as long as the Kuomintang representative remained on the Trusteeship Council, the Soviet Union could not participate in the work of the Council and would not recognize any resolutions or proposals with the participation of the Kuomintang representative as legitimate.

    苏代表退出联合国托管理事会
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国托管理事会第七次会议已于一日在此间开幕。苏联代表苏达托夫在会议开始时即提议自该会中开除国民党残余集团的代表，并要求会议承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府所任命的孟用潜为出席该会的代表。
    苏联代表的提议于付表决时竟因九票的反对而被否决，英国与阿根廷代表弃权。苏联代表在表决后，即退出会场。苏联代表指出：只要国民党代表还留在托管理事会中，苏联就不能参加该会的工作，并不承认有国民党代表参加的任何决议或提议是合法的。
