　　Work Group Assists Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises in Improving Operations
    Yuhua Textile and Dyeing Factory and Three Other Factories Show Improvement
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Four private textile, dyeing, and knitting factories in Beijing, including Yuhua, Cihua, Daxin, and Hefengcheng, have been assisted by the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee's Work Group for Adjusting Industry and Commerce in actively improving their operations and management. These improvements include improving labor-management relations, improving the wage system, increasing capital to expand equipment, and streamlining operations to reduce redundancies. The factories' appearance has now been completely renewed, and production is moving towards normal development.
    The basic link in improving business management is that each factory has adopted labor-management consultation to solve internal problems. The Daxin Textile and Dyeing Factory's capitalist told the workers about the actual difficulties of the business, and labor-management consulted on how to avoid losing money. This improved the workers' enthusiasm and ensured that the monthly output increased to 450 bolts, improved quality, and reduced the rate of defective cloth. The capitalist then guaranteed timely supply of materials, which reversed the loss-making situation. The Yuhua Cotton Weaving Factory is the largest factory in the city's knitting industry, but production has never been on the right track. Recently, after the establishment of a consultation system between labor and management, the old wage system that was unfavorable to production was improved. Workers' morale was high, and they voluntarily formulated labor discipline, consciously abided by it, and put forward slogans such as cherishing machines and not wasting raw materials and materials. They also suggested establishing a technical research association with the factory to improve quality. After the establishment of a labor-management consultation meeting at the Cihua Textile and Dyeing Factory, workers automatically reduced their wages from 6.4 catties of millet per bolt of cloth to 5 catties, and meals from 90 catties of millet per person per month to 80 catties, in order to assist the capitalist in striving for improved business and reducing expenses.
    Improving the unreasonable wage system is a necessary condition for improving workers' enthusiasm. The wages at the Yuhua factory originally had no standards and were determined entirely according to business conditions. The highest wage once reached 600 catties of corn, but when business was bad, the highest wage was only 100 catties of millet, and the lowest wage was as low as 30 catties of millet. Although grades were later divided and fixed wages were implemented, the main condition for grading was the time of arrival at the factory. This resulted in the phenomenon of the same technology having different wages or there being no distinction between skilled labor and simple labor. Therefore, workers were not at ease in production. Now, after democratic evaluation through self-reporting and public discussion, a seven-level wage system is implemented based on technology, seniority, and labor attitude. As a result, workers' enthusiasm has increased, and output has increased by 15% compared to before, and quality has also improved a lot.
    Having too many redundant personnel is also a common problem for many factories, and each factory is striving to streamline operations and economize. The Cihua factory has a total of 52 employees, including 18 staff members. Now, 8 of them are directly involved in production, which has also played a certain role in reducing production costs. In addition, each factory has made achievements in terms of savings. For example, the waste rate of the cutting department of the Yuhua factory was originally 15%, but now it has been reduced to 3%, saving a lot of raw materials.
    Each factory is working hard to increase capital and improve production equipment. The Cihua factory originally lacked working capital, and raw materials could not be supplied sufficiently, so only 12 of the 57 electric machines were running, and they often stopped working due to waiting for materials. The low output was not enough to cover expenses. After increasing capital by more than 25 million yuan and obtaining a loan of 70 million yuan from the People's Bank, 18 machines are now running, and the estimated monthly output can reach 700 bolts of cloth, which can not only maintain expenses but also have a surplus. It is estimated that a net profit of 5,000 catties of millet can be obtained this month, which is a clear change compared to the loss of 8,000 catties of millet in April. The factory will also install the "warp stop" equipment for weaving machines, so that each person can watch two more machines, and production costs will be further reduced.

　　工作组协助私营工商业改善经营
    裕华织染厂等四家情况好转
    【京市新闻处讯】京市私营裕华、慈华、大信、和丰成等四个织染、针织工厂，经市财经委员会调整工商业工作组的协助，积极以改进劳资关系、改善工资制度，增加资金扩充设备，精简节约减少冗员等方法改进经营管理。现工厂面貌已焕然一新，生产步向正常发展。
    改进经营管理的基本环节，是各厂都采取了劳资协商方式解决内部问题。大信织染厂资方把业务实际困难告诉工人，劳资协商怎样做才不赔钱，提高了工人积极性，保证月产量增加到四百五十匹，提高质量减少次布率，资方则保证供料及时，结果扭转了赔累状态；裕华棉织厂是本市针织业最大的工厂，生产始终未入正轨，最近劳资之间建立了协商制度后，改善了不利于生产的旧工资制度，工人情绪高涨，自动订出劳动纪律，自觉地遵守，提出爱护机器，不浪费原料、材料等口号，并建议与厂方成立技术研究会以提高质量。慈华织染厂成立劳资协商会议后，工人为协助资方争取业务好转，减少开支，自动降低工资，由每匹布六斤四两小米降为五斤，伙食由每月每人九十斤小米降为八十斤。
    改善不合理的工资制度，是提高工人积极性的必要条件。裕华工厂工资原来没有标准，完全按业务情况决定，最高工资曾达六百斤玉米，营业不好时最高工资只一百斤小米，最低工资低到三十斤小米，后虽分出等级，实行固定工资，但按到厂时间为分级主要条件，发生同等技术两样工资或熟练劳动与简单劳动没有分别的现象，因此工人不安心生产，现在经自报公议民主评定，改按技术、工龄、劳动态度实行七级工资制。因而工人积极性提高，产量比以前增加达百分之十五，质量也改进不少。
    冗员多也是许多工厂共同的毛病，各厂都在力求精简节约。慈华工厂共有职工五十二人，其中职员达十八人，现已有八人直接参加生产，这对减低生产成本也起了一定作用。此外各厂在节约方面，也有了成绩。如裕华工厂裁剪部废品率原来达百分之十五，现降低到百分之三，节省不少原料。
    增加资金改进生产设备，各厂正向这方面努力。慈华工厂流动资金原极缺乏，原料不能充足供应，所以五十七台电力机只开动十二台，并且还经常因待料停工，产量低，以致不够开支，经增加了资金二千五百多万元，并向人民银行贷款七千万元后，现已开动十八台机器，预计月产量可达七百匹布，不仅能维持开支，且有盈余。预计本月可获纯利五千斤小米。和四月份赔八千斤小米比显已改观。该厂并即将按装织布机的“经停”设备，每人可多看两台机子，生产成本将更降低。
