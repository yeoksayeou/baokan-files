　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: The Philippine reactionaries and the remnant bandits of the Kuomintang are preparing to persecute the vast number of overseas Chinese in the Philippines. According to a dispatch from the Manila office of the Kuomintang bandit gang's Central News Agency on the 12th: The ringleaders of the Kuomintang's Philippine General Branch and the notoriously infamous Non-Philippine Activities Committee of the House of Representatives "will cooperate closely in the future to combat the Philippine Communists" and the so-called "underground CCP workers" in the Philippines. In addition, according to a May 27th Baguio dispatch from the Kuomintang bandit gang's Central News Agency, citing a report from Philippine "senior intelligence" agencies, among the more than 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, 50,000 are considered to be members of "underground organizations" opposing the Quirino government. Tison, chairman of the Non-Philippine Activities Committee, and Shi Yisheng, secretary of the Chiang Kai-shek Party's General Branch in the Philippines, recently held talks and guaranteed mutual cooperation in this persecution work. Tison invited Shi Yisheng to provide intelligence, and Shi Yisheng invited Tison to attend the general branch meeting of the Chiang Kai-shek Party in the Philippines. Chen Zhiping, the bandit gang's ambassador to the Philippines, also stated that he is "currently willing to do everything possible to assist the Philippine Ministry of National Defense." He said: "This is not the first time the embassy has cooperated with the ministry."

    【新华社十六日讯】菲反动派和国民党残匪准备对菲律宾广大的华侨进行迫害。据国民党匪帮中央社马尼拉十二日电：国民党驻菲总支部的匪首与菲律宾臭名远扬的众院非菲活动委员会，“今后将密切合作来打击菲律宾境内的菲共”及所谓“中共地下工作人员”。另据国民党匪帮中央社五月二十七日碧瑶电引菲“高级情报”机关人员的报告，菲律宾的十余万华侨中，五万人被认为是反对季里诺政府的“地下组织”人员。非菲活动委员会主席铁松与驻菲蒋党总支部书记施逸生最近并曾举行会谈，保证在这一迫害工作上相互配合。铁松邀请施逸生供给情报，施逸生邀请铁松参加驻菲蒋党的总支部会议。匪帮驻菲大使陈质平亦表示，他“目前愿意尽一切可能协助菲国防部”。他说：“这并不是大使馆和该部合作的第一次。”
