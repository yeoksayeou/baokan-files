Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th—The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front held a meeting on the 16th, listening to and discussing the report by Xu Xian, member of the Presidium of the Fatherland Front, on the Lee Seung-man gang's sabotage of the Fatherland Front's plan to promote peaceful reunification of North and South Korea and further efforts to achieve peaceful reunification.

　　In his report, Xu Xian emphasized that after the open letter to the entire Korean people from the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front was published, it received enthusiastic support from all patriotic political parties and social organizations and the people of all Korea. Tens of millions of people from all walks of life held mass rallies in response to the call of the Fatherland Front, demonstrating the will of the broad masses of people to live in a unified country. The Lee Seung-man gang implemented a "state of emergency" along the "38th parallel" and in all areas of South Korea, not only preventing representatives of patriotic political parties, social organizations, and democratic figures from all walks of life in South Korea from participating in the North-South representative consultative conference, but also suppressing and persecuting patriotic people with all tyrannical means, and arresting the representatives sent by the Fatherland Front to South Korea to convey the peaceful reunification plan, causing the North-South representative consultative conference originally scheduled to be held from June 15th to 17th to be sabotaged.

　　Xu Xian pointed out that the Lee Seung-man gang, with the military support of US imperialism, is attempting to provoke a civil war in order to maintain its anti-people fascist rule. This once again exposes the Lee Seung-man gang's traitorous crimes of fearing the people and opposing their desire for peaceful reunification.

　　The meeting adopted the following resolutions based on Xu Xian's report: 1. Call on all democratic political parties and social organizations in Korea to mobilize party members, league members, and all the people to further launch a broad struggle against the Lee Seung-man gang, which is undermining the peaceful reunification of Korea; 2. Request the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to urge the Republic's government to study the issue of national peaceful reunification and take appropriate countermeasures; 3. Launch a struggle to rescue the Fatherland Front representatives arrested by the Lee Seung-man puppet government.

　　朝鲜祖国战线号召人民为全国和平统一而斗争
    要求共和国政府研讨并采取适当对策
    【新华社平壤十八日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会于十六日举行会议，听取并讨论了祖国战线主席团委员许宪关于李承晚匪帮破坏祖国战线促进南北朝鲜和平统一方案的实现与为实现和平统一而进一步展开斗争的报告。
    许宪在报告中强调指出：祖国战线中央委员会的告全国人民书发表后，受到全朝鲜所有爱国政党社会团体和全国人民的热烈拥护与支持，数以千万计的各阶层人民纷纷举行群众大会，响应祖国战线的号召，表现了广大人民渴望在统一的国家里生活的意志。李承晚匪帮在“三八线”沿线及南朝鲜全部地区施行了“非常警戒令”，不但阻止南朝鲜爱国政党社会团体的代表和各界民主人士参加南北代表协商会议，而且以一切横暴手段对爱国人士进行镇压与迫害，并逮捕了祖国战线派往南朝鲜传达和平统一方案的代表，致使原定于六月十五日至十七日召开的南北代表协商会议遭到破坏。
    许宪指出：李承晚匪帮在美帝国主义的武力支持下，正妄图挑拨内战以维持其反人民的法西斯统治。这又一次暴露了李承晚匪帮惧怕人民及其与人民要求和平统一的意愿为敌的卖国罪行。
    会议根据许宪的报告通过如下的决议：一、号召全朝鲜各民主政党社会团体发动党员、盟员和全体人民进一步展开广泛的斗争，反对破坏朝鲜和平统一的李承晚匪帮；二、要求朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会促使共和国政府，对国家和平统一问题加以研讨，并采取适当的对策；三、展开营救被李承晚傀儡政府逮捕的祖国战线代表的斗争。
