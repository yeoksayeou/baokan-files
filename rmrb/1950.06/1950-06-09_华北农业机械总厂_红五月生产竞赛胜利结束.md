North China Agricultural Machinery Plant
    Red May Production Competition Concludes Victoriously
    Surpassed the one-and-a-half-month waterwheel production plan, increasing output by 133% compared to April.

    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Lán Cūn reports: The North China Agricultural Machinery Plant launched a production competition movement in Red May. The assembly volume of the plant's main product—waterwheels—and the output of various parts continuously increased with the development of the movement. A total of 1,050 waterwheels were produced throughout the month, an increase of 133% compared to the monthly output of 450 units in April. One group in the fitter workshop assembled 30 waterwheels on May 8th, completed 45 units on the 11th, and further increased to 70 units on the 18th. The foundry workshop produced 23 waterwheel frames on May 3rd, reaching 48 on the 16th. The waterwheel frame processing in the lathe workshop had an output of 18 units on May 2nd, reaching 40 on the 7th. In mid-May, the lathe workshop launched a new challenge to the foundry and forging workshops, proposing to complete the task of 350 waterwheels in the first half of June all at once. On the 25th, the entire plant began to implement the production plan for the first half of June. The Zhāng Fèngquán group in the lathe workshop completed the production task of parts for 1,050 waterwheels ahead of schedule on the 26th. During the same period, product quality also greatly improved. Taking the machine workshop as an example, the scrap rate in April accounted for 0.35% of all products, which was reduced to 0.015% in May; the rework rate was 8.56% in April, while in May, only six out of 19,020 products were reworked.

    The conservation movement, an important part of the Red May production competition, also achieved remarkable results. The plant reduced its daily electricity consumption from 107 kilowatt-hours in the past to 70 kilowatt-hours. The forging workshop also utilized two tons of scrap iron bars. With the development of the movement, the factory's raw material consumption standards, working hour standards, and material requisition and warehouse management systems began to be established, promoting the gradual regularization of the plant.

    The Red May competition movement in the plant was developed on the basis of the production competition in April. During the April competition, with the assistance of technicians, workers created machines for manufacturing waterwheel pipes and improved and created 28 kinds of production tools, enabling the April production task to be completed two days ahead of schedule. The workers received material rewards, and production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. On this basis, the plant's Party, government, and labor union leaders arranged the Red May competition. At the same time, they adjusted the labor force, mobilized workers to repeatedly discuss and revise the May production plan. After the movement started, Party, government, and labor union cadres went to the workshops to discover and cultivate backbone groups, and mobilized Party members, Youth League members, and worker activists to take the lead, so that the movement could continue to develop.

    The Zhāng Fèngquán group in the machine shop's lathe section is a key group for cultivating and learning from the experiences of the Mǎ Héngchāng group. This group has achieved unity and mutual assistance, often studies technology, and pays attention to saving working hours, so that the output of waterwheel vertical shafts in May increased by 77% compared with April, the output of tenons increased by 66%, and the output of horizontal shafts increased by 116%. Due to the challenges of the Zhāng Fèngquán group and the Sūn Zhìfù group, a heated competition was launched in the machine shop. The machine workshop has become the "locomotive" in the whole plant's competition movement. Lǚ Fù, the Communist Party member and leader of the third group in the foundry workshop, made a special trip to the foundry workshop of the Beijing Machinery Plant before the competition to visit and learn about the leadership methods and production methods of their group leader; he returned and mobilized the whole group to increase output. In the competition, he first broke the highest record of two people making six waterwheel frames per day in April, increasing the production from eight or nine frames per day to twelve frames. He also motivated other groups, so that the foundry's sand casting production met the needs of the entire plant. The highest output of screw production in the forging workshop in April was 400 per day per group. If the screw output was not increased, the plant's May competition task could not be completed. Veteran worker Chén Yǒngxiáng led a helper and two apprentices to study a method of adding furnace fire outside of production time, and carefully organized the labor force. His group's daily screw output increased to 900, earning him the title of "Screw King." Other groups adopted this method and also increased their output to 600 or 700. In addition to over-fulfilling the production plan for waterwheels, the plant also greatly exceeded the April level in the output of other agricultural implements such as threshing machines and chaff cutters.

　　华北农业机械总厂
    红五月生产竞赛胜利结束
    超额完成一个半月水车生产计划，较四月份产量提高百分之一百三十三。
    【本报讯】记者蓝村报道：华北农业机械总厂在红五月中，展开了生产竞赛运动。该厂主要产品——水车的装配量和各种零件的产量，随着运动的发展不断提高。全月共生产水车一千零五十架，较四月份月产四百五十架，提高了百分之一百三十三。钳工房一个小组，五月八日装配水车三十架，十一日完成四十五架，十八日更提高到七十架。铸工场制造水车机架，五月三日生产二十三个，十六日达到四十八个。车工房的水车机架加工，五月二日的产量是十八个，七日达到四十个。五月中旬，车工场向铸工、锻工两工场发起新的挑战，提出要将六月份上半月三百五十部水车的任务一齐完成。二十五日，全厂即开始实施六月份上半月的生产计划。车工房张凤泉小组，于二十六日就提前完成了一千零五十部水车部分零件的生产任务。同一时期，产品质量也有了很大改进。以机工场为例，四月份的废品率占全部产品的百分之○·三五，五月份降低为百分之○·○一五；退修率四月份是百分之八·五六，五月份一万九千零二十件产品中，退修的只有六件。
    为红五月生产竞赛重要内容的节约运动，也收到了显著效果。该厂从过去每日用电一百零七度，减少到每日用电七十度。锻工场将两吨废铁条也利用起来。随着运动的发展，整个工厂的原料消耗标准、工时标准及领料、仓库保管等制度，都开始建立起来，促进该厂逐步走向正规化。
    该厂红五月竞赛运动，是在四月份生产竞赛的基础上发展起来的。四月竞赛中，在技术人员的协助下，工人们创造了制造水车管子的机器，改良与创造了二十八种生产工具，使四月份的生产任务提前两天完成。工人们得到了物质奖励，生产情绪空前提高。在这个基础上，该厂党、政、工负责人布置了红五月的竞赛。同时，调整了劳动力，发动工人反复讨论并修改了五月份生产计划。运动开始后，党、政、工干部分头深入车间，发现与培养骨干小组；发动党、团员及工人积极分子带头，使运动能够一直向前发展。
    机器场车工间张凤泉小组，是培养学习马恒昌小组经验的重点小组。该小组已做到团结互助，经常研究技术，注意节省工时，使五月份水车立轴的产量，比四月份提高了百分之七十七，梢子产量提高百分之六十六，横轴产量提高百分之一百一十六。由于张凤泉小组和孙致富小组的挑战，掀起了机器场的热烈竞赛。机器工场又成为全厂竞赛运动中的“火车头”。铸工场第三组组长共产党员吕富，在竞赛之前，特别跑到北京机械场铸工房参观，学习他们小组长的领导方法和生产方法；回来发动全组提高产量。在竞赛中，他首先突破了四月份两人每日翻砂六个水车机架的最高纪录，由两人每日生产八、九架，提高到十二架。并带动了其他小组，使铸场的翻砂生产，供上了全厂的需要。锻工场的螺丝生产，四月份最高产量是每日每组四百个。如螺丝产量不提高，五月份全厂的竞赛任务将不能完成。老工人陈永祥，带领着一个帮匠，两个学徒，研究出不在生产时间添炉火的办法，又精细组织了劳动力，他这一小组的螺丝日产量，竟提高到九百个，得到了“螺丝大王”的称号。其他小组采用了这个办法后，也提高到六、七百个。该厂除水车部分超额完成生产计划外，其他农具如打谷机、铡草机的产量，也大大地超过了四月份的水平。
