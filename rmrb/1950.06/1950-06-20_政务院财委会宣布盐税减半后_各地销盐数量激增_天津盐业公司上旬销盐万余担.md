　　After the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee Announced Halving the Salt Tax
    Salt Sales Increased Sharply in Various Regions; Tianjin Salt Company Sold Over 10,000 Dan of Salt in the First Ten Days of June
    [This newspaper reports] After the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government announced the reduction of salt tax and compensation for salt merchants' existing salt stocks, the general reaction has been very positive, and salt sales have increased sharply in various regions. According to reports from various places, on June 1st, the price of salt was half of what it was on May 31st. People on the streets were discussing, "The current government is truly our people's government, even taking care of salt, one of the seven necessities of life!" Salt transporters and salt peddlers generally have no objections to the tax reduction, but hope that prices will not fall sharply in the future. Transporters are also very satisfied with the compensation method. Members of the Tianjin Salt Merchants Association said, "The government compensating merchants for losses is unprecedented, especially given the current financial difficulties. Reducing taxes takes care of the people's burden, and compensation solves the salt merchants' difficulties. It's truly comprehensive." Some transporters said, "We never dreamed that the government would refund taxes. Therefore, when the Salt Bureau registered existing salt stocks the day before yesterday, we were suspicious and still reported less than we had, as we had done in the past. Although we suffered a small loss, we learned a lesson from this and further experienced the People's Government's concern for the people." In the past, the Da Cheng Salt Store in Tianjin purchased 8,000 jin of salt at a light tax rate and 20,000 jin at a heavy tax rate. Most of it had been sold before the tax reduction, and now only 5,000 jin remain. After offsetting the gains and losses, there is still a profit of 2,500 jin. According to a report from the Salt Affairs General Bureau: Because it is currently the peak season for salt sales, the salt market has begun to improve since late May, and transportation and sales businesses have begun purchasing and transporting salt. After the salt tax reduction, sales have increased even more sharply. The actual sales volume in Changlu from June 1st to 5th increased twentyfold compared to May 1st to 5th. According to incomplete statistics from the East China Salt Bureau during the same period, it also increased twenty-fourfold compared to April 1st to 5th, and increased several times compared to May 1st to 5th.

    [Tianjin News] Tianjin Daily News: Since the Tianjin branch of the China Salt Industry Company adjusted salt prices on the 1st of this month, salt sales have surged. In the first ten days of June, a total of 13,792.31 dan of salt were sold, completing over 45% of the monthly plan. According to the company, upon the Central Financial and Economic Committee's announcement of halving the salt tax, the price of each dan of salt was immediately reduced from 154,000 yuan to 92,000 yuan, and the retail price was adjusted to 950 yuan. Salt transporters and merchants responded very well, believing that the salt price adjustment took care of their reasonable profits. In total, the salt sales volume of more than 60 private salt stores in the first ten days of this month increased by over 121% compared to the last ten days of last month, exceeding the total sales volume in April by 34%. The sales volume of Hefeng Salt Store in the first ten days of this month exceeded that of the last ten days of last month by 164%. Registered transporters are actively reporting shipments. The total number of reported shipments in the first ten days of this month will exceed that of May by one time. Due to the reduction in salt prices, not only has the burden of salt consumption for citizens been reduced, but it has also enabled rural peddlers to come to Tianjin to purchase and transport Lu salt to rural areas with lower purchasing power.

　　政务院财委会宣布盐税减半后
    各地销盐数量激增   
    天津盐业公司上旬销盐万余担
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会公布减低盐税并对盐商存盐予以补偿后，一般反映，均极良好，各地销盐量激增。据各地报导，六月一日盐价比五月三十一日低落了一半，人们在街头巷尾，纷纷谈论说：“现在的政府真是咱们人民的政府，连咱们开门七件事之一的食盐都照顾到了。”各地运销商及食盐小贩一般对减税没意见，惟希望以后不要猛落。运商对补偿办法也很满意，天津盐商公会的委员们都说：“政府赔偿商人损失，是史无前例的，尤其在目前财政困难的情况下，减税照顾了人民负担，补偿又解决了盐商困难，真是面面俱到。”有些运商说：“做梦也没梦到政府还会退税，因此，前天盐局登记存盐，我们猜疑不定，仍按过去作风，以多报少，这样虽吃了一点亏，但由此却得到了一次教训，并更体验到人民政府对于人民的关心。”天津大城盐店过去以轻税购进了八千斤，重税购进了两万斤，减税前多已售出，现在存余不过五千斤，损益相抵，尚得利二千五百斤。另据盐务总局报导：由于目下是销盐旺季，销盐市场自五月下旬以来即已开始好转，运销商业已开始购运，而盐税减低后，更促使销量激增，长芦六月一至五日的实销数比五月一至五日，增加二十倍。华东盐局在同一时间据不完全的统计，也比四月一至五日增加二十四倍，比五月一至五日增加了数倍。

    【天津讯】天津日报消息：中国盐业公司天津直属公司，自本月一日调整盐价后，销盐量突增，六月上旬共销售盐斤一三、七九二·三一担，完成全月计划的百分之四十五强。按该公司根据中央财委会公布食盐税减半征收的同时，即将每担盐由十五万四千元落至九万二千元，零售价调整为九百五十元，运销盐商反映很好，认为盐价的调整，照顾了他们合理的利润。总计本旬六十余家私营盐店总销盐量较上月下旬增销百分之一百二十一强，超过四月份全月售量的百分之三十四。合丰盐店本旬的售量，超过上月下旬百分之一百六十四。已登记的运商，纷纷报运。本旬总的报运数将超过五月份的一倍。由于盐价降低，不但减轻了市民食盐的负担，同时能使农村小贩们纷纷来津购买，将芦盐运到购买力较低的农村去。
