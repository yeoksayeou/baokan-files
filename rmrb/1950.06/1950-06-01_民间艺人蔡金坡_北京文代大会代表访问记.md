　　Folk Artist Cai Jinpo
    ——A Reporter's Visit with a Representative to the Beijing Literary and Art Congress
    By Our Reporter Mu Yang
    Cai Jinpo is a female performer of Xihe Dagu (a type of storytelling with drum accompaniment).
    Xihe Dagu originated in the rural areas west of the Daqing River in Hebei Province and is one of the main forms of entertainment for local farmers. Initially, its melody was slow. It was only twenty or thirty years ago that performers changed it to the fast-paced tune favored by urban laborers. Cai Jinpo, who is now only thirty-one years old, has been performing Xihe Dagu for nearly twenty years.
    Cai Jinpo's father, Cai Baoxing, is a simple farmer and also a veteran of Xihe Dagu. Cai Jinpo fell in love with her father's art from a young age, often drumming on the copper hinges of boxes and singing the tunes she secretly memorized. By the age of thirteen, she had already learned several short pieces familiar to farmers and began to follow her father to Baoding and Beijing, performing at various temple fairs around Beijing and Baoding. At this time, she was distressed: she knew too little material, and she was always singing the same few pieces, often facing "awkward silences." Not only could she not earn money, but some listeners would also stand far away and "make fun of her." This situation did not dampen her ambition. In her spare time from performing, she intensified her studies. Every day before dawn, she would get up to recite lyrics and practice tunes. Sometimes she could only sleep four or five hours a day. These days of hard work lasted for six years, and by the age of seventeen, she had become a regular performer. Soon, she became a famous performer and was invited to Qinhuangdao and the Northeast to perform.
    Xihe Dagu was considered by "officials and dignitaries" to be an art form that could not be brought to the forefront, but they did not relax their oppression of these artists. When Cai Jinpo first arrived in Qinhuangdao, because she had solicited money from a relative of the puppet police chief, all the actors were subjected to beatings, and finally, they had to pay a fine and close their doors. Subsequently, every time they arrived in a new place, they had to first visit these gentlemen. The days in Tianqiao (a popular entertainment district in Beijing) were not easy either. Until before liberation, they still dared not ask a person who was dressed slightly well-off for a penny; when they saw those local ruffians, they had to respectfully call them "uncle" a few more times.
    After liberation, this artist, who had once performed "The Farmer's Happiness" and "Celebrating the New Year" for the farmers, and "The Yang Family Generals" for the people who had fallen under the iron heel of the Japanese invaders, also began to perform new content such as "Wang Yinsheng Leads the Way to Take Beifeng," "The Liberation Army Crosses Xiaoxitian," "Dong Cunrui Sacrifices Himself to Blow Up the Bunker," and "The Great Production." It was praised by the majority of the audience.
    She is one of the initiators of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles Preparatory Committee and a representative to this Literary and Art Congress. She said that she had studied art from a young age, lived a very hard life, and never had the opportunity to learn culture. She felt difficulties in singing new lyrics. She hopes that through this Literary and Art Congress, she can ask friends in the cultural circles to give her more help in the future.

　　民间艺人蔡金坡
    ——北京文代大会代表访问记
    本报记者  穆扬
    蔡金坡，是一位西河调大鼓的女演员。
    西河大鼓起源于河北省大清河西的农村，是当地农民的主要娱乐形式之一。最初，它的调子是缓慢的。二、三十年以前艺人们才把它改成城市劳动人民所喜爱的快调。现在才三十一岁的蔡金坡，演唱西河调已近二十个年头了。
    蔡金坡的父亲蔡宝兴，是个朴实的农民，也是西河调的前辈。蔡金坡从小就爱上了她老人的技艺，常常敲打着箱子上的铜合页，唱起自己偷偷记下来的调子。十三岁时，她已经学会了几段为农民所熟悉的短调，开始跟着老人去保定，串北京，唱遍了京、保左近的各个庙会。这时她是有着苦闷的：会唱的东西太少，唱来唱去老是那几段，“冷场”常常等待着她。不只挣不上钱，有些听客还会远远的站着“瞅臊”。这种情况并没有打消她的进取心，她在演唱的空余时间，加紧苦学。每天天还不亮，她就爬起来背唱词，练调子。有时她一天只能睡四、五小时。苦练的日子持续了六年，到十七岁时，她已成为中常演员。不久，即成为著名的演员，被邀往秦皇岛和东北演唱。
    西河调是被“达官贵人”认为不能登大雅之堂的玩艺儿，但是，他们却没有放松对这批艺人的欺压。蔡金坡初到秦皇岛时，因为向伪警察局长的亲戚敛了钱，所有演员都饱受吊打，最后还要罚钱封门。嗣后，他们每到一个地方，只得先去拜访这群老爷们。天桥的日子也不是好过的。直到解放前，仍不敢向一个穿得稍微阔绰的人要一个钱；见到那些地痞，还要必恭必敬地多叫几声“叔”。
    解放后，这位曾经为农民们演唱过《农人乐》、《过新年》，为沦陷于日寇铁蹄下的人民演唱过《杨家将》的艺人，也开始演唱一些《王银生带路取北峰》、《解放军横过小西天》、《董存瑞舍身炸碉堡》、《大生产》等新内容的鼓词。受到了广大听众的赞扬。
    她是北京市文联筹委会的发起人之一，是这次文代会的代表，她说：她自己从小学艺，过着相当艰苦的生活，一直没有得到学习文化的机会，在演唱新词时感到了困难。她希望通过这次文代大会，请文化界的朋友们在今后多给她一些帮助。
