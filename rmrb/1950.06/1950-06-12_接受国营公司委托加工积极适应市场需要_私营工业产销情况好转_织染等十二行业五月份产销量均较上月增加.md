[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Beijing's private industry, under the correct leadership and strong support of the People's Government and with the gradual revitalization of market transactions, is showing signs of improvement in production and sales. The sales volume of twelve industries, including weaving and dyeing, significantly increased in May compared to March and April. Many factories that had previously suspended or reduced production have gradually resumed operations. Factory management is increasingly confident in overcoming temporary difficulties such as product stagnation and tight capital turnover, and some are working hard to move towards normal development.

The reasons for the improvement are, first, that state-owned specialized companies continue to support private industrial production through commissioned processing, exchange, and procurement, solving the problems of capital, raw materials, and sales channels for many factories. The Beijing Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation organized 644 weaving and dyeing factories to produce in March, April, and May, supplying a total of 80,831 pieces of yarn and cloth, paying 3,720,000 jin of millet in processing fees, and exchanging 79,313 bolts of finished cloth. In those three months, they lost a total of 707,715 jin of millet. As a result, more than 70% of the factories in the weaving and dyeing industry were able to continue to operate in extremely difficult circumstances. By May, the industry's ability to produce and sell on its own gradually strengthened, and the total output of the industry increased by 10% compared to April. In order to support the knitting, match, paper-making, soap, and cigarette industries, department stores invested more than 8.1 billion yuan in March, April, and May, with the main products processed, exchanged, and purchased including 24,840 dozens of socks, 30,580 dozens of towels, and 1,658 boxes of soap. The business conditions of the factories that received support have also improved. Taking the 49 typical households in the knitting industry with better product quality as an example, the total output of socks in May (including processing and self-sales) was 8,046 dozens, an increase of 18% compared to April, and the total sales of socks were 8,604 dozens, an increase of 26% compared to April. Furthermore, the increase in processing orders from state enterprises such as the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and the North China Construction Company enabled most factories in the machinery and metallurgical industries to have work to do in May, reducing the number of factories in a semi-suspended state. The metallurgical industry undertook 666 tons of orders for waterwheels, trench covers, etc., in May, an increase of 36% compared to April and 90% compared to March. In addition, in the machinery and dyeing industry, in addition to the dyeing work processed by the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation, the state-owned clothing factory processed and distributed 13,104 bolts of dyed cloth to various factories in May, so the output of this industry also increased compared to April.

Secondly, new changes in market supply and demand are also an important reason for the improvement in production and sales. After the price stabilization, hoarding households sold off some daily necessities, and some factories suspended or reduced production, the market inventory decreased, and the real purchasing power gradually increased. Therefore, transactions gradually became active in May. At the same time, the price difference between regions and between raw materials and finished products gradually became reasonable. Factories were able to secure a certain profit from production, and the sales of products began to show signs of improvement. Therefore, most factories are actively resuming production or absorbing new capital to improve operations. For example, in the machine-made paper industry, only the Dongfang Factory was intermittently operating in March and April, but three factories had resumed operations in May. In the cigarette industry, only the Xin Yi Factory was originally operating, but the Xin Zhong and Xin Zhongguo factories resumed operations in May. Among them, the products of the Xin Yi Factory were all sold out in May due to their better quality, and the factory increased its machines and capital this month. The production and sales of other industries such as soap, sesame oil, soy sauce, and rubber have also slightly increased compared to April. In addition, the joint efforts of labor and management to overcome difficulties, loans from the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, and certain tax concessions have also played a certain role in promoting the improvement of production and sales.

It must be noted that during the initial improvement, the Bureau of Industry and the industrial sector should, based on market conditions, effectively control the quality and quantity of products, and strive to appropriately balance the relationship between supply and demand to avoid blind recovery and development.

　　接受国营公司委托加工积极适应市场需要
    私营工业产销情况好转
    织染等十二行业五月份产销量均较上月增加
    【京市新闻处讯】京市私营工业在人民政府正确领导、大力扶助和市场交易逐渐活跃下，产销情况呈现好转。织染等十二个行业五月份的产销量比三、四月份显著增加，一度停工、减产的工厂已有不少陆续恢复开工。工厂厂方对克服产品滞销、资金周转不灵的暂时困难，信心益增，有些正努力步向正常发展。
    好转的原因，首先是国营专业公司继续以委托加工、交换、收购等方式扶植私营工业生产，解决了许多工厂的资金、原料、销路问题。花纱布公司北京分公司在三、四、五三个月中，组织了六百四十四个织染厂生产，共供应纱料八万零八百三十一件，付出三百七十二万斤小米的工缴费，交换成品七万九千三百十三匹布，三个月中共赔七十万七千七百十五斤小米，织染业百分之七十以上的工厂因此在极度困难中得以继续维持。到五月份，该业自产自销的力量逐渐增强，全业产量比四月份增加百分之十。百货公司为扶植针织、火柴、造纸、肥皂、卷烟等业，三、四、五三个月里共投入资金八十一亿余元，加工、交换、收购的主要产品共有袜子二万四千八百四十打、毛巾三万零五百八十打、肥皂一千六百五十八箱。得到扶植的工厂业务情况也都见好转，以针织业中产品质量较好的四十九个典型户为例，五月份共产袜子（包括加工、自销）八千零四十六打，比四月份增加百分之十八，共销袜子八千六百零四打，比四月份增百分之二十六。再如铁道部材料局、华北建筑公司等国家企业机关加工订货数量的增加，使机器、冶制等业大多数工厂五月份里都有活可做，半停工状态的工厂减少。冶制业五月份承做了水车、沟盖等订货六百六十六吨，比四月份增加百分之三十六，比三月份增加百分之九十。另外，机器染业除去有花纱布公司加工的染活外，五月份里又有公营被服厂加工染布一万三千一百零四匹分配给各厂，因此该业产量也比四月份增加。
    其次，市场供需关系的新变化也是使产销情况好转的重要原因。有些日用必需品自物价平稳囤户抛售和一些工厂的停工减产后，市场存货量减少，真实购买力逐渐增长，所以五月份成交渐活跃，同时，地区与地区间，原料和成品间的差价逐渐合理，工厂生产既能掌握一定利润，产品销路又露出起色，故多数厂方正积极复工生产或吸收新资金改进经营。如机器造纸业三、四两月只有东方工厂一家断续开工，五月份已有三家复工；卷烟业原来只有信一工厂一家开工，五月份又有新中、新中国两家复工，其中信一工厂因质量较好，五月份里产品全数销出，该厂本月又增开机器增加资金。其他如肥皂、芝麻油、酱油、橡胶等业产销量也都比四月份略有增加。此外劳资协力克服困难，人民银行北京分行的贷款以及某些税收的照顾等，对促成产销情况好转，也起着一定的作用。
    必须注意的是：在开始好转时，工业局和工业界应根据市场情况切实掌握产品的一定质量和产量，力求供需关系适当平衡，避免盲目恢复和发展。
