　　North China Department Store Adjusts Commodity Prices
    Wholesale Volume of Major Commodities Increases Significantly
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th] Since the North China Department Store adjusted retail and wholesale prices of commodities starting on the 6th of this month, the wholesale volume of major commodities has increased significantly compared to before. For example, the wholesale volume of "Victory" brand tires on the 4th was 20, but on the 6th it increased to 255; the wholesale volume of coarse granulated sugar increased from 6,230 jin on the 4th to 43,779 jin on the 7th. Private merchants purchasing from the company have increased to approximately 70 percent of the total number of purchasers.
    The reason for the rapid increase in wholesale sales is primarily that, after the adjustment, the difference between wholesale and retail prices has increased, and private stores purchasing goods can now obtain a certain profit. Secondly, the company proactively promotes sales to various commercial firms, providing private merchants with various conveniences. For example, in the past, private merchants had to use cash to buy goods from the company, but now they can use People's Bank checks as cash; the purchased goods can also be delivered by the company to designated locations.

　　华北区百货公司调整商品价格
    主要商品批发量大增
    【新华社天津八日电】华北区百货公司从本月六日开始调整商品零售和批发价格后，主要商品批发量已较前大为增加。如胜利牌外胎四日批售量为二十副，六日即增至二百五十五副，粗砂糖的批售量由四日的六千二百三十斤增至七日的四万三千七百七十九斤。向公司批购的私商增至约占批购者总数的百分之七十。
    批发销售量迅速增加的原因，首先是经调整后，批发与零售价格之间的差额增大，批货的私营商店已能获得一定的利润。其次，该公司主动向各商号进行推销，给私商以各种便利。如过去私商向公司买货，必须使用现款，现在则可用人民银行的支票抵现；所购货物并可由公司负责送至指定地点。
