Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd: Xining News: The Qinghai Provincial People's Government convened a symposium on the 12th of this month, inviting over 60 representatives from various ethnic groups, including Hui, Han, Mongolian, Tibetan, Tu, and Salar, as well as responsible comrades from provincial and municipal organs. The meeting discussed issues such as the construction of political power in areas inhabited by single or mixed ethnic groups, the development of the economy and culture of minority nationalities, and the training of minority nationality cadres. At the meeting, Vice Chairman Zhang Zhongliang gave a report on the general situation of ethnic work in Qinghai. He pointed out that the Qinghai Provincial People's Government is a joint political power of all ethnic groups and strata, formed in accordance with the principles of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the actual situation of mixed ethnic habitation in Qinghai. In areas of the province inhabited by a single ethnic group, ethnic regional autonomous institutions will be gradually established; in areas of mixed ethnic habitation, joint political power of all ethnic groups and strata will be formed. The representatives unanimously supported this report, believing that the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy and joint political power of all ethnic groups and strata is a concrete manifestation of the policy of equality, mutual assistance, and unity among all ethnic groups. The representatives also suggested that the government should, as much as possible, absorb just and popular princes and nobles, Qianhu, Baihu, etc., from the Mongolian and Tibetan regions to participate in the work of the People's Government. When discussing the development of economic undertakings, the representatives condemned the cruel oppression and exploitation of the reactionary rule of the Ma Bufang bandit gang, which had led to the increasing bankruptcy of the pastoral industry of nomadic peoples. The representatives suggested that the government should vigorously set up veterinary epidemic prevention stations in pastoral areas, strengthen livestock maintenance and focus on trial breeding, restrict the slaughter of female livestock, in order to improve the output and quality of wool. Regarding the development of cultural education for minority nationalities and the training of minority nationality cadres, the representatives of all ethnic groups suggested that the government should focus on establishing educational undertakings for various ethnic groups; and enthusiastically supported the People's Public School that has been established to train minority nationality cadres. They believe that the fact that young people of all ethnic groups can learn revolutionary knowledge together, regardless of each other, is a happiness given to them by the People's Government. Mongolian and Tibetan representatives suggested that the government set up branches of the People's Public School in Dulan, Tar Monastery, and other places, and suggested organizing mobile education teams to go deep into nomadic areas to educate nomadic youth.

    【新华社西安二十二日电】西宁讯：青海省人民政府于本月十二日邀集回、汉、蒙、藏、土、撤拉等各族代表及省、市各机关负责同志六十余人举行座谈会，讨论民族聚居和杂居地区的政权建设及发展少数民族经济、文化与培养少数民族干部等问题。会上，张仲良副主席就青海民族工作的概况作了报告。他指出：青海省人民政府是按照人民政协共同纲领原则及青海民族杂居的实际情况组成各民族各阶层联合的政权。在省内单一民族地区，逐渐建立民族区域自治机构；在民族杂居地区，组成各民族各阶层联合政权。代表们对于这一报告一致表示拥护，认为实行民族区域自治和各族各阶层联合政权是各民族平等、互助、团结政策的具体表现。代表们并建议政府应尽量吸收蒙、藏地区公正的和受人民欢迎的王公、千百户等，参加人民政府工作。在讨论发展经济事业时，代表们痛斥马匪步芳反动统治的残酷压迫和剥削，曾使游牧民族的牧畜业日益破产。代表们建议政府在游牧区大力设置兽疫防治站，加强牲畜的保养和重点试办选种，限制屠宰母畜，以提高羊毛的产量和品质。关于开展少数民族文化教育与培养少数民族干部问题，各族代表建议政府有重点地创办各民族的教育事业；并热烈拥护已开办的培养少数民族干部的人民公学。他们认为各民族青年能不分彼此，在一起学习革命知识，这是人民政府给他们的幸福。蒙、藏代表建议政府在都兰、塔尔寺等地设立人民公学分校，并建议组织巡回教育队，深入游牧地区，教育游牧民族青年。
