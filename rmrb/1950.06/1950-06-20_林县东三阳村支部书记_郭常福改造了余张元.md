　　Lin County's Dong Sanyang Village Party Branch Secretary Guo Changfu Transforms Yu Zhangyuan
　　Guo Changfu, the Communist Party branch secretary of Dong Sanyang Village in the Second District of Lin County, Pingyuan, helped lazy man Yu Zhangyuan in spring production and transformed him. Yu Zhangyuan and his son were both capable of working. Zhangyuan's father had no plan for production. Zhangyuan had always been unwilling to work hard and didn't understand production techniques. His family of seven cultivated sixteen mu of good land, but they never harvested enough grain to eat. Last autumn, they only harvested nine shi of grain. The land became worse and worse, and they became less and less motivated to produce, resulting in only consumers and no workers, which led to family discord. The family was almost bankrupt. Because Yu Zhangyuan was lazy, no one in the village wanted to cooperate with him in production. Seeing this situation in his family, Branch Secretary Guo Changfu was determined to first cooperate with Zhangyuan's family in order to help and transform him.
　　Yu Zhangyuan and forty or so other farmers in the village had jointly bought a cotton gin last winter, but they stopped ginning cotton before the new year. So Guo Changfu mobilized Zhangyuan to buy the cotton gin with him, preparing to gin cotton after the autumn harvest. Each household contributed 250 jin of rice. However, Zhangyuan's family didn't have enough rice and could only contribute 100 jin. Guo Changfu paid 150 jin for him, to be repaid after making a profit from ginning cotton. In the first month of the lunar calendar, Guo Changfu also mobilized Zhangyuan's father to work in Shanxi. He said to Zhangyuan's father, "Your family's sixteen mu of land will be cultivated by me and Zhangyuan in mutual aid, and I guarantee that this year's cultivation will be better than in previous years." Zhangyuan's father went out to work as a craftsman. But there was no food to eat at home immediately, and it was impossible to sow seeds in the spring. Zhangyuan wanted to sell one mu of land or sell the donkey to maintain spring life. Guo Changfu immediately lent him 70 jin of millet, 20 jin of wheat, and 10 jin of corn, a total of 100 jin of grain. The two also jointly contracted to build a toilet, which was completed in two days. Zhangyuan also got 20 jin of rice. In February, Guo Changfu went to Shanxi twice with him and carried back 240 jin of rice, the wages earned by his father, which, after paying off some debts, was enough for spring consumption.
　　With the grain problem solved, they began spring production. Together they built 38 zhang of embankments, reclaimed one mu of river beach land, and opened three mu of virgin land. Zhangyuan's family had four fen of good land that had been abandoned for several years, and it took more than twenty workdays to plow it once. But Guo Changfu and he only spent twelve workdays to plow it. In the past, Zhangyuan didn't harrow or weed the wheat he planted in the spring. This year, with Guo Changfu's mutual aid, his thirteen mu of wheat was harrowed once and weeded twice, and he mobilized the women in his family to pull the grass along the wheat ridges. He planted three fen of cotton last year, but this year he planted one mu. Guo Changfu planted one mu and two fen last year, but this year he planted three mu. During mutual aid work, Guo Changfu taught him how to cultivate the land. Zhangyuan's family life improved, and the phenomenon of disharmony disappeared. In order to thoroughly transform Yu Zhangyuan, Guo Changfu always worked with him this spring, regardless of the work, and constantly carried out ideological education on him. Whoever owed work tried to repay it with labor, or used the grain earned from the reclaimed land to offset wages. Now the coal they have prepared can be burned until after the wheat harvest. According to the land planted by Zhangyuan's family now, in a normal year, they can harvest five or six more shi of grain than in the past. They calculated that the cotton gin could earn 1,500 jin of rice this year, and they would buy another small cart after the autumn harvest. In this way, Yu Zhangyuan's family completely overcame the difficulties of life, and the whole family produced in harmony. Guo Changfu also educated all party members and cadres in Dong Sanyang Village with his experience of implementing mutual aid and transforming Yu Zhangyuan. Therefore, every party member and cadre realized that as long as they were determined and found a way, there were no difficulties that could not be overcome, and no work that could not be done well. The village branch plans that during the busy farming season, every party member should take the lead in implementing mutual aid and drive the production of all the villagers.

　　林县东三阳村支部书记  郭常福改造了余张元
    平原林县二区东三阳村中共支部书记郭常福，在春季生产中与懒汉余张元互助生产，改造了余张元。余张元父子两个都能劳动。张元的父亲在生产上无计划。张元则一贯不肯好好劳动，也不懂生产技术。他家七口人，种了十六亩好地，可是年年打的粮食不够吃。去秋只打了九石粮食。地越种越坏，他们越生产越没劲，弄得只有吃饭的，没有做活的，因此家庭不和睦。家庭几乎要破产了。因为余张元懒惰，村中的人谁也不愿和他互助生产。支书郭常福看到他家这种情况，下决心要先与张元家实行互助，以便帮助他、改造他。
    余张元去冬曾与同村四十来户农民合买了一架轧花车，但是他们在年前就停止轧花了。于是郭常福就动员张元，和他伙买下这辆轧花车子，准备秋后轧花。两户各出米二百五十斤。但张元家米不够，只能出一百斤。郭常福给他垫出一百五十斤，等轧花赚利后再还。阴历正月，郭常福又动员张元的父亲到山西做工。他向张元父亲说：“你家十六亩地由我和张元互助来种，保证今年比往年种得强。”张元父亲就出外去当匠人。但是家中当下就没得吃，春季也无法下种。张元想卖掉一亩地或卖掉驴子来维持春季生活。郭常福当即借给他小米七十斤，麦子二十斤，玉茭十斤，共一百斤粮食。两人还合伙包工，盖了一个厕所，二天就做完。张元又得米二十斤。二月间郭常福又和他去山西两次，担回他父亲挣的工资米二百四十斤，除还了一些账以外，足够春季的食用。
    吃粮解决了，他们就开始春季生产。他们共同筑了三十八丈岸，修河滩地一亩，开了三亩生荒。张元家有四分好地，荒了好几年，翻一遍需要二十多个工。但郭常福和他只费十二个工就翻完了。张元过去种的麦子，春天也不耙不锄。今年和郭常福互助，他的十三亩麦子，耙了一遍锄了两遍，并动员家中妇女拔了一遍麦垅边的草。他去年种棉花三分，今年却种了一亩。郭常福去年种了一亩二分，今年则种了三亩。在互助作活中，郭常福教他学会种地的方法。张元家庭生活好转，不和睦的现象也没有了。郭常福为了彻底改造余张元，今春不管啥活，总是和他在一块做，并不断地对他进行思想教育。谁欠下了工，尽量用工来还，或者用开的荒地所收入的粮食来顶工资。现在他们准备的煤已可烧到麦后。根据现在张元家所种的地，按平常年景，今年就可比过去多收五、六石粮食。他们计算今年轧花车可赚米一千五百斤，秋后再买一辆小车子。这样，余张元家就完全克服了生活的困难，全家和睦生产。郭常福并将他和余张元实行互助、改造余张元的经验，教育了东三阳村全体党员干部。因此使每个党员干部都体会到：只要下决心，想办法，没有克服不了的困难，没有做不好的工作。该村支部计划在农忙时，每个党员都要带头实行互助，把全村农民的生产带动起来。
