　　Shijiazhuang Special District Commissioner's Office Decides to
    Punish Cadres Obstructing Freedom of Marriage
    藁城 County Court President Li Cede Receives Demerit

[This newspaper, Shijiazhuang News] The Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office of Shijiazhuang Special District, Hebei Province, recently decided to punish Li Cede, president of the Gaocheng County People's Court, and others who hindered free marriage. Sun Zhisuo, a liberated farmer from Shuixiang Village, Sixth District, Gaocheng County, and Zhao Xiaoyan, a working woman, freely married, but were disrupted by village cadres Sun Luojie and others, forcing Zhao Xiaoyan to wander outside for more than 20 days. District Chief Li Jike and others did not handle it appropriately. Later, Zhang Qingshen and Wang Yugui, cadres of the CPC Gaocheng County Committee, discovered this and persuaded the woman's parents to agree to Sun and Zhao's marriage. Just as the wedding was about to take place, Sun Zhisuo was arrested by the county People's Court (because the court president Li Cede and judge Zhang Mingcun had bureaucratic and feudal ideas, did not conduct in-depth investigations, and listened only to one side of the accusation. They believed that "marriage is not allowed without the consent of the woman's parents," which led to the destruction of Sun and Zhao's marriage again. (See page 3 of this newspaper on May 25 for details). After discovering this matter, the Shijiazhuang Commissioner's Office immediately sent personnel to understand the situation from all relevant personnel and cooperated with the Special District Women's Federation to conduct investigation and research. On May 21, it made a decision on the marriage issue of Sun and Zhao and a decision on handling those who obstruct and destroy it: (1) The marriage of Sun Zhisuo and Zhao Xiaoyan is purely free and voluntary, and is completely reasonable and legal. The government should allow them to register their marriage. The Commissioner's Office instructed county and district cadres to go to the village to cooperate with village cadres (branch secretary, village head) to preside over the wedding of Sun and Zhao and conduct education among the masses. The president of the court and the district chief of the Sixth District should apologize to the masses and admit their mistakes to establish the masses' correct understanding of the new Marriage Law. (2) Sun Luojie (previously reported as Sun Luojie), a village representative of Shuixiang Village, Sun Zhengzhong, a security officer, Sun Qiuyou, a squad leader, and Zhao Xiaoyan's brother Zhao Xiaozhuan, destroyed and interfered with freedom of marriage, and illegally imprisoned and beat Zhao Xiaoyan, violating policies, laws and disciplines. They should be detained to the county for introspection and given appropriate punishment according to law. Li Genbao, a cadre of the water conservancy promotion agency, played a major role in obstructing and destroying it, and should be dismissed and sent to the court for punishment. (3) Li Cede, president of the Gaocheng County People's Court, Li Jike, district chief of the Sixth District, Zhang Ming, a judge of the court, and other cadres showed serious bureaucracy, listened to only one side of the story, did not conduct in-depth investigations, illegally arrested people, had insufficient understanding of the Marriage Law, and supported the backward side. In addition to ordering them to conduct a review and apologize to the masses, Court President Li Cede should be given a demerit, District Chief Li Jike should be given a demerit, Judge Zhang Ming should be given a criticism, and the county government should be ordered to implement it. (4) After discovering the problem, comrades Zhang Qingshen and Wang Yugui of the Gaocheng County Party Committee actively understood and researched it, and conducted explanations and education from all aspects to support the free, independent, and voluntary marriage of Sun and Zhao. They were able to thoroughly implement the new Marriage Law and should be commended. (5) In order to implement the new Marriage Law, in addition to the Commissioner's Office issuing a notice to the entire special district, the Gaocheng County Government will issue a notice to all districts and villages in the county, requiring cadres at all levels to study and research seriously to establish a correct understanding of the Marriage Law.

    藁城县法院院长李策德记大过一次
    【本报石家庄讯】河北省石家庄专区行政督察专员公署最近决定处分妨碍自由婚姻的藁城县人民法院院长李策德等。该专区藁城县六区水香村翻身农民孙志锁与劳动妇女赵小烟自由结婚，被该村村干部孙洛杰等多方破坏，迫使赵小烟在外流浪二十多天，区长李计科等未作适当处理。后被中共藁城县委会干部张清深、王玉贵发觉，曾说服女方家长，同意孙、赵二人结婚。正在将举行婚礼之际，又被该县人民法院将孙志锁拘捕（因该院院长李策德、审判员张明存有官僚主义与封建思想，未深入了解情况，偏听一面的控诉。并认为“不得女方家长同意不得结婚”，以致孙赵二人的婚姻又遭受破坏。（详情见五月二十五日本报三版）。石家庄专署发觉此事后，即派员找各有关人员了解情况，并协同专区妇联进行调查研究，已于五月二十一日作出对孙赵婚姻问题的决定及处理阻挠破坏人员的决定：（一）孙志锁赵小烟的婚姻问题，是纯粹自由自愿，完全合理合法的，政府应准其登记结婚。专署责成县区干部亲赴该村协同村干部（支部书记、村长）主持孙赵二人婚礼，向群众进行教育。法院院长、六区区长应向群众道歉，承认错误，借以树立群众对新婚姻法的正确认识。（二）水香村村代表孙洛杰（前次报载为孙洛解），治安员孙正中，中队长孙秋有，赵小烟之兄赵小转，破坏、干涉婚姻自由，并非法禁闭绑打赵小烟，违反政策法纪，应拘留到县进行反省，并依法予以适当处理。水利推进社干事李根保在阻拦破坏中起着主要作用，应撤职送交法院处分。（三）藁城县人民法院院长李策德，六区区长李计科，法院审判员张明等干部，表现了严重的官僚主义，偏听偏信，不深入了解情况，非法拘捕，对婚姻法认识不足，支持落后的一方。除令其检讨并向群众悔过道歉外，院长李策德应受记大过处分，区长李计科应受记过处分，审判员张明应受批评处分，责成县府执行。（四）藁城县委机关张清深、王玉贵二同志发现问题后，积极了解研究，从各方面进行解释教育，支持孙赵二人自由自主自愿的婚姻，能彻底执行新婚姻法，应受到表扬。（五）为了贯彻新婚姻法，除专署通报全专区外，并由藁城县府通报全县各区村，要各级干部认真学习、研究，以确立对婚姻法的正确认识。
