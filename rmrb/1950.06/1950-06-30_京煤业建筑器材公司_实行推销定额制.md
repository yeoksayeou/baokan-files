　　Beijing Coal Industry Building Materials Company
    Implements Sales Quota System
    [From Our Own Correspondent] In May, when coal sales were sluggish, the Beijing Coal Industry Building Materials Branch Company guaranteed the fulfillment of its sales and monetary return tasks by implementing a sales quota system. The company's May plan was to sell over 50,000 tons of coal, 2,000 tons of cement, and 3,000 cubic meters of timber, with a planned monetary return of 7,981 million yuan. At the beginning of the month, through meetings, coal plants, timber yards, and other units first made their own sales estimates based on their capabilities, followed by public discussions, and finally the leadership determined the quotas. This ensured a reasonable allocation of tasks. Within the plants, the same method was used to assign specific quotas to sales teams and individual salespersons. This approach greatly enhanced the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the staff. For example, Li Hongru from the Chaoyangmen Coal Plant, a newly promoted salesman from the logistics staff, initially estimated selling 380 tons of coal that month. With great enthusiasm and confidence, he contacted customers daily and personally hired vehicles to deliver coal for them. As a result, he not only completed his task but also sold an additional 40 tons. Wang Jianhua from the same plant sold 2,600 tons of coal in May. Zhang Fulai from the Andingmen Coal Plant voluntarily gave up his Sunday rest to ensure the completion of his task. At the Guang'anmen Timber Yard, the cadres' morale was extremely high due to the implementation of the quota system, completing more than 100% of their tasks, exceeding April's performance by six times.
    However, some deviations occurred during the implementation process. For example, in the allocation of tasks, individual units and a small number of salespersons emphasized self-estimation, neglecting leadership; some salespersons harbored conservative ideas and were unwilling to share new methods they had created with others; and some focused solely on sales, neglecting monetary returns, resulting in large amounts of credit. The company has now proposed improvement measures: both sales and monetary returns should have quotas, leading cadres and non-business departments should strictly implement the work responsibility system, a comprehensive inspection of each unit's task completion should be carried out, democratic evaluation should be conducted at the end of the month, and rewards and punishments should be given based on performance.

### 京煤业建筑器材公司  实行推销定额制

　　京煤业建筑器材公司
    实行推销定额制
    【本报讯】北京煤业建筑器材分公司在煤炭滞销的五月里，由于实行了推销定额制，保证了推销与货币回笼的任务。该公司五月份计划推销煤炭五万余吨，洋灰二千吨，木材三千立方米；计划回笼货币额七十九亿八千一百余万元。月初曾通过会议形式由各煤厂、木厂等单位根据自己的推销能力，先行自认，然后公议，最后由领导确定。任务得以合理分配。厂内以同样方式具体到推销小组及推销员个人。这种办法，大大提高了工作人员的积极性与责任心。如朝阳门煤厂李洪儒是由勤杂人员中新提拔的推销员，当月自认推销三八○吨煤。他有高度的热情与信心，终日在外联络用户，并亲自代客雇车送煤。结果完成任务外又推销了四十吨。该厂王建华五月份推销了二千六百吨煤。安定门煤厂张福来为保证完成自己任务，自动放弃了星期日休息。广安门木厂由于定额制的实行，干部情绪极其高涨，完成任务百分之百以上，超过四月份的六倍。
    但在执行过程中也发生了一些偏差，如在分配任务时，个别单位及少数推销人员强调自认，忽视领导；个别推销员存有保守思想，创造的新办法不愿介绍给别人；有的单纯推销忽视货币回笼，造成很大赊欠数字。现该公司已提出改进办法：推销与货币回笼均要实行定额，领导干部及非业务部门严格执行工作责任制，全面检查每个单位完成任务程度，月终进行民主评定，并根据成绩好坏进行奖惩。
