Instances of Applying the Marriage Law to Resolve Marriage Cases (Continued from Yesterday)
A Glimpse of the People's Court of the City Clearing Backlogged Cases

Bigamy and concubinage are strictly prohibited by the new Marriage Law. Therefore, if such acts occur after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the court will convict the perpetrator of bigamy.

But how to deal with the facts of bigamy and concubinage that were already established before the promulgation of the Marriage Law?

If the woman files for divorce from a man with bigamy or concubinage, the court will approve the divorce.

The Second District Office once handled such a case: A woman in her thirties, Wang Shu, requested to end her cohabitation relationship with an old man in his seventies, Zhou. The case was as follows: Old man Zhou was originally an old-fashioned warlord. In the old society, he relied on money and power to mess around with women everywhere. According to witnesses, "The number of women ruined by Zhou is countless. He has seven or eight wives and concubines at home." Wang Shu—a woman from a poor family with a weak temperament—was one of them. When Wang Shu applied to the government to end the cohabitation relationship, she said, "In 1937, I went to work in the antique shop he opened, and he forced me to cohabit with him. For more than ten years, due to the pressure of life, I have not been able to break free from the cage. Now I have found a job, and I can live independently. I am no longer willing to cohabit with him against my will." The government accepted her request, asked Zhou to take out 3,000 catties of millet as alimony, and issued a divorce certificate to close the case.

In addition, the former wife (the first wife) of a landlord in the suburbs and the later wife (the concubine) of a guard chief of a pseudo-garrison headquarters, filed for divorce with the court. The city court granted the divorces in both cases.

Generally speaking, regarding the polygamous behavior of bigamy and concubinage left over from the old society, if the woman files for divorce from the man, the government or the court will approve or grant the divorce, and provide for her in terms of property. If the man files for divorce from the later wife, it will also be approved or granted, and provision will also be made for her in terms of property. For the man's act of bigamy before the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the law may not investigate the past (that is, not convict him of bigamy). However, other crimes such as abuse and abandonment will still be punished according to law.

A child bride, Li Guiying, requested to break off the relationship, and the court immediately granted it.

The cruel system of child brides will disappear forever with the promulgation of the new Marriage Law. When dealing with cases in which child brides request to break off the relationship, the people's courts always decisively grant the divorce.

For example, Li Guiying was brought to Lei Changsheng's house as a child bride at the age of eleven. When Guiying arrived at the man's house, she worked all day long without being given enough food or clothing, and she was also made to watch the manure factory in winter. Excessive labor prevented the young Li Guiying from developing normally. She is now eighteen years old, but she is still very thin.

Today, Li Guiying is no longer willing to be a child bride. But when she proposed to break off the relationship, Lei Changsheng's mother, Zhao, was furious and shouted, "Your family owes my family money. Six years ago, your family borrowed more than fifty yuan in United Bank currency and couldn't repay it, so I took you in." Lei Changsheng said, "You can't leave today, or you have to pay me back the money!" However, despite the defendant's sophistry, the court's judgment still solemnly stated:

"The system of child brides is prohibited by the Marriage Law of our People's Government. The plaintiff's request to terminate the relationship as a child bride is completely justified, and the court should unconditionally guarantee it. The related person Lei Zhao said, 'Because her mother borrowed sixty yuan from us (pseudo-United Bank currency), I let her be a child bride in my family' and presented a written statement as proof. However, this behavior of treating women as commodities must be opposed. Moreover, the plaintiff has worked in the defendant's house for seven years and has been driven and used. The value created by her labor is far more than a mere sixty yuan of pseudo-United Bank currency. The defendant's request to claim this money for buying her body is even more forbidden by current laws. Therefore, the judgment is as follows:

One, the marriage contract between the plaintiff and the defendant is terminated.

Two, the defendant's counterclaim is rejected."

The above examples powerfully illustrate that only under the shining light of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, all acts of oppression and abuse of women are being duly punished; all the legitimate rights and interests of women and children have been protected; and the birth of the new Marriage Law is creating millions of happy families where husbands and wives love, help, unite, and work together!

　　适用婚姻法解决婚姻案件的实例（续昨）
    市人民法院清理积案工作之一斑

    重婚、纳妾的行为是为新婚姻法所严格禁止的。因此，如果在婚姻法公布以后，再有此种行为发生，法院即判他重婚罪。
    但是在婚姻法公布以前既成的重婚、纳妾的事实怎么办呢？
    女方提出与重婚纳妾多妻的男子离异，法院予以判准。
    二区区公所曾经处理过这样一个案件：一个三十多岁的妇女王淑要求和一个七十多岁的老头脱离同居关系。案情是这样的：老头儿周某原系旧式军阀，在旧社会里，仗着金钱和势力，到处胡搞女人，据证人称：“被周某糟塌的妇女实在已经数不清了，光是娶在家里的妻妾就有七八个之多。”而王淑——一个家庭清苦，性情懦弱的女子——就是其中之一，王淑在向政府申请脱离同居关系时说：“民二十六年，我到他家开的古玩店做事，他就强迫我跟他同居，十几年来，由于生活所迫，我始终不能挣脱牢笼，现在我已找到工作，我能够独立生活，我再也不愿勉强跟他同居了。”政府接受了她的要求，让周某拿出三千斤小米作为赡养费，并发给离异证明文件结案。
    此外还有一个郊区地主的前娶妻（大老婆）一个伪警备司令部警卫处长的后娶妻（小老婆），向法院提出离婚。市法院都判离了。
    一般地说：对待旧社会里遗留下来的重婚、纳妾的多妻行为，如果女的提出和男的离婚，政府或法院即予批准或判离，在财产上给以照顾，如果男方提出和后娶的离婚，亦批准或判离，财产上亦给以照顾。对于婚姻法公布前男方的重婚行为，法律上可以不究既往（即不判重婚罪）。但对其他罪行如虐待、遗弃等罪，则照样还是要依法制裁。
    童养媳李桂荣请求脱离关系，法院立即判准。
    残酷的童养媳制度，将随着新婚姻法的公布而永远一去不复返了。人民法院在处理童养媳要求脱离关系的案子时，总是果断地判处离异。
    例如李桂荣在十一岁那年就被雷长生家领来当童养媳，桂荣到了男家，成天干活也不给吃饱、穿暖，冬天还让他看粪厂。过度的劳动使年青的李桂荣不能正常的发育，今年她已经十八岁了，可是个子却长得还是很瘦小。
    今天李桂荣不愿再当童养媳了，但当她提出了脱离关系的时候，雷长生之母赵氏竟大发雷霆，嚷道：“你娘家欠了我家的债，六年前你家借了我五十多块联银币还不起，我才把你领来的。”雷长生说：“今天你不能走，不然就得还我的钱！”然而尽管被告等如何诡辩，法院的判决书上还是严正的写着：
    “查童养媳为我人民政府婚姻法所禁止，今原告提出解除童养媳的要求是十分正当的，法院应无条件的予以保障。关系人雷赵氏说‘因为她母亲借我们六十块钱（伪联币），所以我让她当我家童养媳’并提出字据作证。但是这种以妇女为商品的行为，必须反对。且原告在被告家劳动七年，身受驱使，其劳动所创之价值岂止区区六十块伪联币。被告要索此项买身钱债，更为现行法令所不许，故为判决如下：
    一、原被告之婚约解除。
    二、被告反诉请求驳回。”
    上面一些例子，有力地说明了：只有在中华人民共和国婚姻法的光辉照耀下，一切压迫虐待妇女的行为，正在得到应有的惩处；一切妇女和子女的合法利益已经获得了保护，新婚姻法的诞生，正在创造着千万个夫妻互爱、互助、团结、劳动的幸福家庭！
