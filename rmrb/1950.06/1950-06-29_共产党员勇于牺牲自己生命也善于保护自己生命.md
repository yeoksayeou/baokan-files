　　Communists are brave in sacrificing their own lives and also good at protecting their own lives
    Pei Hongwei
    If a Communist Party member cannot sacrifice himself for the overall interests of the revolution when necessary, and regards his own life as "infinite and invaluable," thinking that "treating one's life in this way is a waste," and even grandiosely uses "In order to adhere to the tasks given to her by the Party, she has the right to protect her health and value her life, so as not to fail the education given to her by the Party" to defend herself, then we cannot imagine what kind of work such a Party member can do for the Party. We also cannot understand what this "right" to "have the right to protect oneself" means. In fact, this statement is defending one's own personal interests and is helping individualism grow within the Party. The result will be that the Party loses its purity and combat effectiveness.
    Zhao Guilan was absolutely right not to throw away the mercury fulminate; she made her life shine for the cause of the Party.
    There are many stories of Communist Party members correctly cherishing their lives. I once heard the story of Comrade Tong Jiali, who persisted in tunnel warfare in central Hebei. Surrounded by the Wang Fenggang bandit troops, Comrade Tong Jiali led four comrades into the tunnel to persist in the battle. In the first five days, he divided his one and a half cornbread buns among everyone, saying, "Because I am a Communist Party member, I cannot value my own life more than others." On the fifth day, the tunnel was destroyed by the enemy, and the four comrades were captured. The two entrances to the section of the tunnel he was in were also filled with earth by the enemy. At this time, he had to dig an opening to go out and continue fighting, but he was extremely hungry. Later, he found half of a dead piglet, but it was so rancid that it was inedible. At this time, a fierce struggle unfolded in his mind. He thought: For the cause of the Party and for the interests of the people, I should live on. I should rush out. In this way, the Party gave him courage and strength. In the next two days, he endured the rancid smell and used this half of the dead piglet to prolong his life. He dug open the blocked entrance and finally completed the glorious combat mission on the seventh day. Now he is still loyally working for the Party. On the surface, Tong Jiali and Zhao Guilan's practices are completely different, but in essence they are consistent, that is, they truly gave their lives to the Party and the people. For the interests of the Party, they can bravely sacrifice themselves, and they can also bravely protect their lives. Their actions inspire the hearts of millions of Party members and soldiers, making them fight more heroically. Therefore, the power of this kind of action is immeasurable and invincible!

　　共产党员勇于牺牲自己生命也善于保护自己生命
    裴鸿维
    假如一个共产党员在必要的时候不能为革命的整体利益而牺牲自己，而把自己的生命看做“是无限的，无价的”；认为“这样处理自己的生命是一种浪费”。还冠冕堂皇的以“为了坚持党给她的任务，她有权保护自己的健康和重视自己的生命，这样才不辜负党给她的教育”来为自己辩护，那么我们不能想像这样的党员能为党做些什么工作。我们也无法了解“有权保护自己”的这个“权”作何解释。实际上这种说法是在给自己的个人利益作辩护，是在扶助个人主义在党内成长。其结果将会使党失去纯洁性与战斗性。
    赵桂兰不扔雷汞是完全正确的，她使自己的生命为党的事业发挥了光辉的作用。
    共产党员正确爱护生命的故事是很多的。我曾经听过在冀中坚持地道战的佟家力同志的故事。在王凤岗匪部的包围圈中，佟家力同志领着四位同志转入地道坚持战斗，在前五天内他把他的一个半窝窝头分给大家吃了，他说：“因为我是共产党员，我不能把自己的生命看得比别人的更重要。”在第五天地道被敌人炸坏了，四位同志被俘了。他所在的一段地道的两个口，也被敌人用土填死了。这时他必须掘开口子出去继续战斗，但他已极度饥饿。后来他摸索到半截死小猪，但已腥臭得不能吃。这时在他思想中展开了剧烈的斗争。他想：为了党的事业、为了人民的利益，我应该活下去。我应该冲出去。就这样党给了他勇气与力量。在后两天中，他忍受着腥臭用这半截死小猪延续了他的生命，他掘开了填塞的口子，终于在第七日完成了光荣的战斗任务。现在他仍然忠诚地为党工作着。就表面看，佟家力和赵桂兰的作法是完全不同的，但实质上他们是一致的，那就是他们真正的把生命交给了党和人民。为了党的利益他们能勇敢的牺牲自己，也能勇敢的保护生命。他们的行动鼓舞着千百万党员和战士的心，使他们战斗得更为英勇。因之，这种行动的力量是不可估量的，不可战胜的！
