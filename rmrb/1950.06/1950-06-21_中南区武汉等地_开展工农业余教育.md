　　Central South China, Wuhan and other regions
    Launch Industrial and Agricultural Spare-Time Education
    [From Our Newspaper] Spare-time education for workers and peasants has been gradually launched in various parts of the Central South China region. In Wuhan, according to incomplete statistics for May, 103 workers' night schools have been established, with more than 13,000 students. In addition, many units have established regular study groups, with more than 11,000 workers participating in the study. In the past three or four months, some workers have learned five or six hundred characters, and most have learned about three hundred characters. Since March, various units under the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau have established 37 spare-time schools, with a total of more than 3,300 employees enrolled. In addition, some small and medium-sized cities in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces have also established some spare-time schools for workers and peasants, organized by local factories, schools, and cultural centers.
    In the process of running industrial and agricultural education, some regions have gained preliminary experience. For example, Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, in the process of running literacy classes for workers and peasants in their spare time, realized that spare-time schools must have fixed teachers and must teach according to the characteristics of the students. The county simultaneously ran two literacy classes. One was taught by a fixed teacher who could grasp the students' ideological situation, relate the lectures to the actual problems in the workers' lives, and establish an examination system. The students were highly motivated and progressed rapidly. The other literacy class did not have a fixed teacher, resulting in disjointed lectures, and the teachers could not grasp the students' situation and needs. The students felt that the class was boring, and the number of people studying gradually decreased. The workers' and peasants' night school in Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei, found that the worker and peasant cadres who participated in the study were often absent from class due to work and could not keep up. It has now been decided to adopt a "little teacher" system to strengthen tutoring to solve this difficulty.
    At present, although some areas have started night schools, the leadership is not sound, and there are often many people at the beginning of the class, but the number of students gradually decreases, and the teachers also relax. There is also a lack of teaching materials. Some use Northern teaching materials, which do not suit the tastes of workers and peasants in the South; some use primary school teaching materials, which are not welcomed by workers; some compile their own, or use materials from newspapers, etc., each doing their own thing. These problems remain to be solved.

### 中南区武汉等地  开展工农业余教育

　　中南区武汉等地
    开展工农业余教育
    【本报讯】中南区各地已逐渐开展工、农业余教育工作。在武汉市，据五月份不完全统计，已建立了工人夜校一百零三所，学员共一万三千余名。另外还有许多单位建立了经常的学习小组，参加学习的工人也有一万一千余人。三、四个月来，有的工人已经学了五、六百字，一般学了三百字左右。郑州铁路局所属各单位，自三月以来共举办了三十七所业余学校，入学职工共三千三百余人。此外，湖北、湖南、江西等省一部分中小城市，也由当地工厂、学校、文化馆等创办了一些工农业余学校。
    在举办工农教育中，有的地区已取得了初步经验。如江西宜春县在办理工农业余识字班的过程中，体会到了业余学校必须有固定的教员，并须根据学员特点教学。该县同时举办两个识字班，一个由固定的教员上课，能掌握学员的思想情况，讲课时联系到工人生活中的实际问题，并订定了考试制度，学员的学习情绪很高，进步很快。另一个识字班的教员不固定，结果讲课不衔接，教员也不能掌握学生的情况与需要，学员们感到上课枯燥无味，学习的人便逐渐减少了。湖北黄岗专署的工农夜校，发现了参加学习的工农干部常常因工作而缺课，赶不上，现已决定采用“小先生”制，加强补课来解决此一困难。
    目前，有的地区虽然办起了夜校，但领导还不健全，常常开课时人多，慢慢地学员少下去，教员也松劲了。教材也很缺乏，有的采用北方教材，不合南方工农口味；有的采用小学教材，工友也不欢迎；有的自己编选，或采用报纸上的材料等，各搞一套。这些问题，还待进一步解决。
