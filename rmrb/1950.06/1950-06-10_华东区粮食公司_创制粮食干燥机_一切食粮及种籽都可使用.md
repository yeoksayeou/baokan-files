Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th: The China Grain Company's Huadong District Company has created a grain dryer, solving the problem of grain being prone to mold and rot due to excessive moisture or dampness. According to the company's laboratory results, using this machine to dry grain from 17% moisture content to 14% allows the grain to safely survive the plum rain season. If dried to 13%, it will not spoil for one or two years. At the same time, the temperature inside the dryer reaches around 90 degrees Celsius during drying, which can kill all the pests inside the rice without any loss to the rice's quality or nutritional components. The Zhongnan Grain Company, in order to strengthen grain storage management, has sent people to Shanghai to negotiate and prepare for adoption.

　　The designer and builder of the rice dryer is the China Diesel Engine Company. According to the company's explanation, all food grains and plant seeds can use this type of dryer. They have now designed six types of stationary dryers, the largest of which can dry 4.5 million jin of grain every 24 hours, and the smallest of which can dry 300,000 jin every 24 hours. They have also designed two types of mobile dryers that can be loaded on trucks or ships. Each can dry 600,000 jin of grain every 24 hours. Drying one shi (150 jin) of grain requires approximately one jin of anthracite coal and consumes 0.2 kilowatt-hours of electricity.

    创制粮食干燥机
    一切食粮及种籽都可使用
    【新华社上海九日电】中国粮食公司华东区公司创造粮食干燥机，解决了粮食因水分过多或因受潮湿而易于霉烂的问题。根据该公司化验的结果，使用该机将粮食所含水分由百分之十七干燥至百分之十四，粮食就可以安度黄梅季节，如干燥至百分之十三，那么保存一、二年也不会损坏。同时烘干时机内温度达摄氏九十度上下，可将米里面害虫全部杀死，至于米的品质、营养成份完全不受损失。中南粮食公司为加强粮食保管工作，已派人至上海接洽，准备采用。
    烘米机的设计和建造者是中国柴油机公司。据该公司的说明，一切食粮及植物种子，都可使用此种干燥机。他们现已设计出六种固定式的干燥机，最大型的每二十四小时可烘干粮食四百五十万斤，小型的每二十四小时可烘干三十万斤。另又设计了活动式的干燥机两种，可以装载在汽车上或船上使用。每二十四小时可烘干粮食六十万斤。每烘干粮食一石（一百五十斤）约需焦煤一市斤，消耗电力零点二度。
