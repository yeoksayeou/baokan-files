　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th. According to TASS, a protest rally was held in New York City on the 5th, attended by over three thousand workers and intellectuals, in support of the twenty-one American progressives who will be imprisoned in federal prison within weeks on charges of "contempt" of the House Un-American Activities Committee. These twenty-one progressives are the eleven members of the board of directors of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee and ten writers and directors from Hollywood.

　　Actor Blumberg gave the opening address, welcoming the assembled masses on behalf of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee and the National Council of the Arts, Sciences and Professions.

　　Professor Bradley delivered a speech at the meeting. He had been dismissed from his position as head of the German Department at New York University due to persecution by the House Un-American Activities Committee. He said that despite the cruel persecution, he would continue to fight against fascism. He said that the center of fascism has now shifted to the United States.

　　Bartsky, Chairman of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, who was sentenced to six months in prison, pointed out that the act of imprisoning twenty-one anti-fascist fighters was an act of weakness and despair by the U.S. government, rather than an act of strength. He cried out, "Tell them they haven't scared us, they haven't separated us!"

　　Lustig, a leader of the United Electrical Workers Union, said that the Wall Street monopolists will find that the conspiracy to suppress anti-fascism by imprisoning a few anti-fascist fighters will ultimately fail, because more and more Americans know that "the real criminals are those public enemies of mankind who are plotting a third world war and trying to suppress anyone who exposes their conspiracy."

　　Hollywood writer Lawson called on all Americans to join this winnable battle—the battle against war, against fascism, the battle sufficient to make America a good motherland for good people.

　　Progressive writer Fast also delivered a speech at the meeting.

　　声援被迫害的反法西斯战士
    纽约数千人举行大会   
    演说者一致谴责“非美活动委会”
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：有三千多工人和知识分子参加了五日在纽约市举行的抗议大会，声援在数周内就会在“蔑视”众院非美活动委员会的罪名下被投入联邦监狱的二十一位美国进步人士。这二十一位进步人士为反法西斯难民联合委员会干事会的十一名干事和好莱坞的十位作家和导演。
    演员布伦堡致开会词，他以反法西斯难民联合委员会和艺术、科学与自由职业全国委员会的名义欢迎与会群众。
    布拉德莱教授在会上发表演说。由于非美活动委员会的迫害，他已被纽约大学解除德语系主任的职务。他说：尽管有残酷的迫害，他仍将继续为反对法西斯主义而斗争。他说，法西斯主义的中心现已移至美国。
    被判处六个月徒刑的反法西斯难民联合委员会主席巴尔斯基指出：囚禁二十一名反法西斯战士的行动，是表现美国政府孱弱和绝望的行动，而不是表现它有力的行动。他大声疾呼地说：“告诉他们，他们没有吓倒我们，没有分开我们。”
    联合电气工人工会领袖勒斯蒂格说：华尔街垄断资本家们将发现，以监禁少数反法西斯战士来压制反法西斯主义的阴谋终将失败，因为越来越多的美国人知道“真正的罪犯就是那些正在策划第三次世界大战，企图压制任何人来揭穿他们的阴谋的人类公敌”。
    好莱坞作家劳森号召一切美国人必须参加这一能够获胜的战斗——反对战争，反对法西斯主义的战斗，足以使美国成为善良人民的好祖国的战斗。
    进步作家法斯特也在会上发表了演说。
