　　Business of Electrical Supply Stores Improves After Joint Operation

　　[This newspaper, Baoding News] Electrical supply, brick kiln, sauce, shoe, and pig bristle industries in Baoding, Hebei, are actively organizing joint operations to overcome the difficulties in sluggish sales encountered after price stabilization. The electrical supply industry in the city felt the difficulties after March, and some had already closed down due to pessimism. Managers of electrical supply stores such as Huazhong Mingchang actively initiated the organization of joint operations, which was warmly supported by their counterparts and approved by the government. Various businesses have subscribed for shares. As of May 16, 15 households had subscribed for shares. Formal operations began on the 16th under the name of the Electrical Supply Joint Operation General Store. The result of organizing the various stores has solved the difficulties of having too few people and incomplete stock, so that they will no longer have to decline large projects. On the other hand, it has accelerated the turnover of funds, preventing a large number of electrical materials and equipment from becoming backlogged due to being unsaleable. At the same time, it has provided opportunities for mutual research, learning, and improvement in technology. For example, some workers in the wired department who did not understand the work of the wireless department now have the opportunity to learn. The cost of electrical materials has also been reduced. Before the organization, each household had to go to Beijing and Tianjin to buy goods even if they did not buy much. After the joint operation, only one person from the 15 households needs to go to Beijing and Tianjin to buy goods, saving a lot of travel expenses. As a result, the price of light bulbs below 40 degrees has dropped from 5,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan each, and black wire has dropped from 250 yuan to 200 yuan per foot. Recently, they also bought 8 million yuan worth of equipment and radio parts from Tianjin and plan to install radios themselves. To support their production, the bank has temporarily loaned 3 million yuan as working capital, which has further encouraged the industry's confidence and enthusiasm in operation. Under the influence of the electrical industry's joint operation and the government's publicity and education, 27 brick kiln businesses have successively formed a brick kiln industry purchasing and marketing committee, jointly purchasing and marketing on the basis of the old production, reducing blind production and mutual exclusion. Sauce businesses Wensheng Yong, Yongchang, Yongmao and Xinglong, Jinshengtang Sauce Garden, as well as the pig bristle and shoe industries, have successively initiated joint operations. In order to implement the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference, the People's Government has instructed the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to actively assist and organize private businesses to form joint operations, so as to help them overcome temporary difficulties.

　　保定中小型工业联营
    电料行联营后营业情况好转
    【本报保定讯】河北保定电料业、砖窑业、酱业、鞋业、猪毛业等，为度过各该业在物价稳定后，所遇到的销路呆滞困难，积极组织联营。该市电料业在三月后即感到困难，有的已因消极而歇业。华中明昌等电料行经理积极发起组织联营，受到同业的热烈拥护，并取得了政府同意。各同业纷纷入股。截至五月十六日已有十五户入股。十六日已正式开始营业。名称为电料联营总店。各行店组织起来的结果，解决了人少货不全的困难，不致再在遇有大工程时，做不了而最后只好谢绝。另一方面加速了资金的周转，不致再使大批电料器材因卖不出去而形成背货。同时，在技术上也获得了互相研究、学习与提高的机会。如过去有线部工人有的不懂无线部工作，现在也有机会可以学习了。电料成本也有所降低，未组织前每户虽买货不多也得到京津去买，联营后十五户只要一个人到京津买货就行，节省往返的开支不少。致使四十度以下的灯泡每个由五千元降到四千元，黑线每尺由二百五十元降到二百元。最近并新从天津买回八百万元器材及无线电零件，计划自己安装无线电。银行为扶植其生产，已暂贷三百万元为活动资金，更鼓舞了该业经营的信心与热情。在电业联营影响和政府宣传教育下，砖窑业二十七户也相继组成了砖窑业购销委员会，在旧的生产基础上联合购销，减少盲目生产与互相排斥的现象。酱业文盛涌、永昌、永茂和兴隆、锦生堂酱园及猪毛业、鞋业均先后发起联营。人民政府为贯彻人民代表会议的决议，责成工商局及工商联合会负责积极协助并组织私商联营，使其度过暂时困难。
