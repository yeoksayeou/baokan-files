Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: Speech by Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 22nd. The full text is as follows: Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, National Committee Members, Comrades:

    At the Second Session of the First National Committee, I, on behalf of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, would like to present brief opinions:
    We have listened to Chairman Mao's opening remarks, Vice-Chairman Liu's report on land reform, and the reports from the heads of various departments of the Central People's Government on economic adjustments, industry and commerce, taxation, political affairs, military affairs, cultural and educational matters, and the work of the courts. All of these prove that significant achievements have been made in the eight months since the establishment of the Central People's Government. Difficulties in the course of victorious development have been and are being overcome, and efforts are being made to improve the work. We are deeply satisfied. We sincerely support the land reform that will be implemented this winter in areas with a population of one hundred million farmers.
    Land reform is indeed a systematic and fierce struggle. It is necessary to overthrow the feudal land system and the rule of the landlord class that have existed for thousands of years and to implement the system of land ownership by farmers, so that the oppressed men and women laborers can be emancipated, thereby liberating rural productive forces, developing agricultural production, and paving the way for the industrialization of New China. This is an arduous and difficult task.
    Therefore, we must extensively mobilize and organize farmers to participate in land reform, and at the same time, we must pay attention to absorbing women, who account for half of the rural population, to participate, so that the mass base of land reform is wider and deeper, and it is also more conducive to developing production. This is beneficial to both land reform and women's liberation. According to old liberated areas and areas where land reform was implemented last winter (such as Henan), large numbers of women have been organized to actively participate in land reform, and they have played a great role in land reform. This is a good proof.
    Regarding the organization of women, there have been three situations in the past. First, when land reform began, both male and female farmers were mobilized and organized to join the peasant associations together. As a result, the awareness of both male and female farmers was raised, their work was active, the unity of male and female farmers was strengthened, and the ranks of farmers were expanded. Second, enlightenment and education were first carried out among male farmers, and after the peasant association was established, men were mobilized to mobilize women. As a result, although women joined the peasant association, they did not receive sufficient education and influence, and their awareness and enthusiasm for work could not keep up with the progress of land reform. Third, the peasant association had been organized, and the struggle had passed. Only when it was checked and found that women had not been mobilized, were women pulled out, which resulted in formalism and no effect. Based on this, we would like to suggest to the people's governments, leaders, and land reform implementation organs at all levels in the areas where land reform is being implemented: adopt the first method, organize male and female farmers into peasant associations and peasant representative conferences at the same time, and pay attention to absorbing women activists to participate in the work of the leadership organs of the peasant associations. In the process of land reform, women's representative conferences can be convened as needed. In areas where women's federations have been organized, the women's federations should focus on land reform work and actively assist the peasant associations in carrying out their work, so as to carry out land reform more effectively.
    Article 11 of the Land Law stipulates the principle of uniform land distribution according to population. This is fair and reasonable and in line with the principle of equality between men and women. Only the People's Government led by the Communist Party can guarantee the land rights of male and female farmers. It has been proven from areas where land reform has been implemented that women's enthusiasm for production has been greatly encouraged and their enthusiasm for participating in production has been increased after they have obtained a share of land. In the old liberated areas where land reform has been completed, women participating in agricultural production generally account for about 50 to 70 percent of the female labor force. In areas with a good foundation for women's work and a particular shortage of labor, they account for about 80 percent of the female labor force. During busy farming seasons, women in some areas universally go to the fields. In addition to actively participating in production, they further learn and improve agricultural techniques, becoming an indispensable force in the restoration and development of agricultural production.
    To this end, we suggest that when land reform is implemented this winter, leading cadres at all levels should educate male and female farmers to clearly recognize and value women's due land ownership and use rights. When distributing land or issuing land certificates, the principle of distribution according to population must be implemented, so that women can also receive a share of land. In the process of land reform, special feudal constraints on women should be gradually and appropriately removed as necessary and possible.
    Finally, we firmly believe that under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the people's governments at all levels, we will surely successfully complete this largest-scale land reform in history. We firmly believe that through this land reform, the rights of equality between men and women in all aspects as stipulated in Article 6 of the Common Program will be implemented in a wider area.
    We wish the land reform a successful victory!

### 全国妇联副主席  李德全的发言

    全国妇联副主席
    李德全的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全二十二日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席、副主席、全国委员、各位同志：
    在第一届全国委员会第二次会议上我代表中华全国民主妇女联合会提出简要的意见：
    我们听了毛主席的开会词，刘副主席关于土地改革问题的报告，以及中央人民政府各部门负责人关于经济形势调整工商业和税收、政治、军事、文教、法院工作等报告。都证明了自中央人民政府成立以来八个月的工作中获得了显著的成绩，曾经克服了和正在克服着胜利发展中的困难，并力求工作的改进，我们深感满意。对于在今冬将要在一亿农业人口的地区实行的土地改革，我们更衷诚地拥护。
    土地改革确是一场系统的激烈的斗争，要推翻几千年来的封建土地制度及地主阶级的统治，而实行农民的土地所有制，使被压迫的男女劳苦农民得到翻身，借以解放农村生产力，发展农业生产，为新中国的工业化开辟道路，这是一个繁重而艰巨的任务。
    因此，我们必须广泛地发动和组织农民来参加土地改革，同时必须注意吸收占农民半数的妇女群众来参加，使土地改革的群众基础更广泛而深入，亦更有利于发展生产。这是对土地改革也是对妇女解放有利的。根据老解放区及去年冬季实行土改的地区（如河南）都曾组织了广大的妇女积极参加土地改革，她们在土地改革中表现了很大的作用，这是很好的证明。
    关于组织妇女，过去有三种情况，第一种：在开始进行土地改革时，即一起发动与组织男女农民加入农会，其结果是男女农民的觉悟都提高了，工作都积极，加强了男女农民的团结，壮大了农民的队伍。第二种：先在男农民中进行了启发教育，农会已成立，再动员男人发动妇女，其结果妇女虽参加了农会，但所受的教育和影响不足，觉悟程度及工作的积极性不能配合和赶上土改进程。第三种：农会已组织起来了，斗争也过去了，一检查没有发动妇女，这才把妇女拉出来，结果流于形式，没有作用。据此，我们特向实行土改地区的各级人民政府、领导与执行土改的机关建议：采用第一种办法，把男女农民同时组织到农民协会和农民代表会议中，并注意吸收妇女积极分子参加农民协会领导机关的工作，在进行土改的过程中，根据需要可召开妇女代表会议。凡已有妇联会组织的地区，妇联应以土改工作为中心，积极协助农民协会进行工作，以便更有力的进行土地改革。
    土地法第十一条规定按人口统一分配土地的原则，这是公平合理，亦合乎男女平等的原则的，只有共产党领导的人民政府才能保证男女农民的土地权。从已实行土改的地区证明出来，妇女在分得一份土地以后，即大大的鼓励了妇女生产的热情，提高了妇女参加生产的积极性：在已经完成土改的老解放区，参加农业生产的妇女一般约占妇女劳动力的百分之五十到七十，在妇女工作基础好，劳动力特别缺乏的地区约占女劳力的百分之八十左右，农忙时有些地区妇女普遍下地。她们除了积极参加生产外并进而学习与提高农业技术，成为恢复与发展农业生产中的一支不可缺少的力量。
    为此，我们建议，在今冬实行土改时，各级领导干部应教育男女农民明确认识并重视妇女应有的土地所有权与使用权，在分配土地或颁发土地证时，必须贯彻按人口分配的原则，使妇女同样分得一份土地，在土改过程中，根据必要与可能的情况，逐步地适当地解除妇女所受的特殊封建束缚。
    最后，我们深信，在中央人民政府和各级人民政府的领导下，一定能胜利地完成这次历史上最大规模的土改，我们深信经过这一次土地改革，共同纲领第六条所规定在各方面的男女平等的权利将在更宽广的地区里得以贯彻。
    我们预祝这次土改的胜利成功！
