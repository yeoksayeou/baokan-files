　　Lüda Creates New Type of Industrial School
	To facilitate workers' further education, the school curriculum connects with enterprise-run spare-time schools and university engineering colleges.
	[Our newspaper's Dalian dispatch] After nearly half a year of preparation, the Lüda area has established its first new type of industrial technical school. The school is divided into three parts: undergraduate, preparatory, and training courses, with more than 500 students. The school's educational policy is to "cultivate a large number of excellent technicians, engineers, and other industrial professionals from the working class and other strata of young people." Therefore, the school's curriculum is connected at one end with the technical schools and training courses attached to various enterprises in Lüda, and at the other end with the curriculum of the Dalian University of Technology. In this way, it paves the way for the working class in Lüda to gradually pursue advanced studies in culture, science, and technology. In order to take care of the current situation of low cultural level and advanced age of workers, and the uneven curriculum standards of night schools or training courses run by various factories and enterprises, the school has established three worker preparatory courses (preparatory), so that outstanding workers from various enterprises can enter the school on the basis of learning in training courses and night schools, complete the junior high school curriculum after two years of preparatory study, and continue to advance to undergraduate and university studies.
	The technical school's education plan is closely integrated with the actual needs of current production and construction. According to the current production situation in the Lüda area, the school's undergraduate program has first established mechanical and chemical engineering departments, and plans to add chemical engineering and electrical engineering departments in the second half of the year. The purpose of preparatory study is to enable students to enter specialized studies after learning general technical theory and basic knowledge. Therefore, it adopts the policy of focusing on learning essential courses well, and secondary courses can be learned less or not at all.
	The teaching method is to integrate theory with practice. In order to facilitate students' internships, the Dalian Industrial Museum, rich in content, has been entirely handed over to the school. Teachers and students can make full use of the museum's equipment and materials for in-depth research and practice. At the same time, the leading authorities have allocated a large amount of funds as the school's operating expenses for this year, for the purchase of instruments, expansion of school buildings, and the needs of the practice factory.
	The Lüda Industrial Technical School has gradually grown up in the process of the recovery and development of industrial production in the Lüda area. In 1948, when industrial production in the Lüda area had just entered the construction stage, the Guandong Industrial Company (the predecessor of the Lüda Administrative Office's Industrial Department) held a training course in which 63 factory administrative personnel were trained in two and a half months, and they participated in the restoration of production work. In 1949, a technical school was established on the basis of the training course, with five classes in mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, and textile engineering, as well as two training courses for accountants. The technical study time for the students was six months, and a large number of technicians were trained and hundreds of grassroots cadres were trained in rotation in a short period of time. At the end of 1949, after the closing of the Industrial Exhibition marking the development of industrial construction in Lüda, the Lüda District Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Lüda Administrative Office, and the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions jointly decided to establish this regular new type of industrial technical school to meet the needs of industrial development; and determined the school's guiding principles, tasks, and educational methods. Over the past six months, the leading authorities have allocated a large amount of funds and sent capable cadres to prepare. New school buildings have been built, and many teachers have been hired from Shanghai and other places. Currently, there are 29 full-time teachers and 77 administrative cadres and staff in the school. On June 5th, the school officially held its opening ceremony. Han Guang, Chairman of the Lüda Administrative Office, and other leaders of various agencies and organizations, as well as Zhang Zhicheng, Secretary of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, went to congratulate.

　　旅大创建新型工业学校
    为便利工人逐步深造，学校课程与各企业业余学校及大学工学院相衔接。
    【本报大连讯】经过将近半年的筹备，旅大区建立了第一所新型的工业技术学校。全校分设本科、预科、训练班三部分，现有学生五百余人。该校的教育方针，是“从工人阶级及其他各阶层青年中，培养大批的优等技工、技师、工程师及其他工业专门人材”。因此，该校的课程一端与旅大各企业单位附设的技术学校和训练班相衔接；另一端与大连大学工学院的课程相衔接。这样，就为旅大工人阶级铺平了在文化、科学、技术上逐步深造的远大前途。为照顾目前工人文化程度低、年龄大，各工厂企业所办夜校或训练班的课程标准还不整齐的具体情况，该校设立了三个工人准备科（预科），使各企业的优秀工人能在训练班与夜校学习的基础上，考入该校，经过两年预科的学习，修完初中课程，继续升入本科、大学深造。
    技术学校的教育计划，紧密结合当前生产建设的实际需要。根据旅大区目前生产情况，该校本科首先建立了机械、化工两科，下半年还准备增加化工与电工两科。预科的学习是为了使学生经过一般的技术理论和基础知识的学习之后，进入分科学习，因之采取有重点地学好必需的课程的方针，次要的课程可以少学或不学。
    教学方法是理论与实际一致的。为了便利学生实习，大连市内容丰富的工业博物馆已全部交给该校。师生们可以充分运用该馆的设备与材料，作深入的研究和实习。同时，领导机关拨出了大量款项作为该校本年的办学费用，以供购置仪器、扩大修建校舍和实习工厂之需。
    按旅大区此一工业技术学校是在旅大区工业生产的恢复与发展过程中逐步成长起来的。一九四八年，旅大区工业生产刚步入建设阶段时，关东实业公司（旅大行署工业厅前身）曾举办一期训练班，在两个半月中训练了六十三名工厂行政人员，他们参加了恢复生产工作。一九四九年在训练班基础上建立了技术学校，分设机械、化工、纺织等五个班，另外还训练了两期会计员。学员的技术学习时间为六个月，在短期内培养了大批技术工人和轮训了数百名基层干部。一九四九年末，标帜着旅大工业建设发展的工业展览会闭幕后，中共旅大区党委、旅大行署、旅大总工会就会商决定成立此一正规的新型的工业技术学校，以适应工业发展的需要；并确定了该校的方针任务和教育方法。半年来，领导机关拨出了大量经费和派出得力干部进行筹备。修建了新校舍，并在上海等地聘请了多名教师。现全校各科已有专任教师二十九名，行政干部、职员七十七名。六月五日，该校正式举行了开学典礼。旅大行署韩光主席及其他各机关团体首长，中共大连市委书记张志诚等均前往祝贺。
