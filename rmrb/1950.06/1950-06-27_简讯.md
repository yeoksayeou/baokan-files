　　Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Actively Promotes This Newspaper
　　The Beijing Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is actively promoting this newspaper. On the 14th, the first group of the bureau's trade union advocated that each person should promote at least one copy. Comrade Jiang Runtian sold four copies that day. The trade union used loudspeakers to report on the distribution situation in each bureau and explained the key points of promotion and the methods of the reading group. To facilitate statistics and reporting, the trade union also sent a special person to collect information on the newspaper promotion situation of each group and readers' opinions on this newspaper.

　　Beijing People's Art Theatre Work Team Returns from Factory
　　The Beijing People's Art Theatre work team returned on the 2nd of this month after completing its mission in the factory. The factory work team was divided into two groups: one to the Changxindian Railway Factory and the other to the Xinhua Printing Factory outside Fuchengmen. In addition to rehearsing plays in the large railway factory, the Changxindian factory group assisted workers in performances from "May 1st" to "May 7th" and taught workers basic knowledge and skills of recreational activities. Because the level of the railway factory's recreational cadres needed to be improved, the theater has decided to send a comrade to help them rehearse the play "Towards a Road," and promote their recreational activities through the performance of this play. The Xinhua Printing Factory group rehearsed the collective creation of the factory workers, "Get United and Boost Production". After going to the factory, they invited the original author and workers who had performed the play to participate in revising the script, interview the "real people" in the play, and collect "factual" materials. They also participated in the actual production in the factory, helping workers with "folding pages" and "book sewing". After this factory work, the political thought and professional level of the factory work team has generally improved a step.
