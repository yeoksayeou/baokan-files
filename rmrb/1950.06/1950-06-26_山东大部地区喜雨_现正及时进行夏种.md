Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd. Most areas of Shandong Province received widespread rainfall on the 17th and 18th. People's governments at all levels are leading farmers to sow crops such as corn (maize), beans, and sweet potatoes. In areas with less or no rain (east of Weixian County), the local government is also mobilizing farmers to carry water for planting. Shandong had been lacking rain for a long time before the wheat harvest, and farmers were worried about not being able to carry out summer planting. This rainfall can be said to be timely.

　　山东大部地区喜雨  现正及时进行夏种
    【新华社济南二十三日电】山东省大部地区于十七、十八两日普遍得雨，各县人民政府正领导农民播种苞米（玉蜀黍）、豆类和地瓜（甘薯）等作物。在雨小或无雨地区（潍县以东），当地政府亦正发动农民挑水点种。山东在麦收前久已缺雨，麦收后农民正愁无法进行夏种，此次降雨，可称及时。
