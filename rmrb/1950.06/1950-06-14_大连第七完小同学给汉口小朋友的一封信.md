Dear children of Hankou:

　　All of us students miss you very much. We would like to communicate with you and introduce each other's learning and living situations.

　　Before August 15th, the people of the Lüda area were under the rule of the Japanese invaders, living a dark and miserable life. Since August 15, 1945, when the heroic Soviet Red Army liberated us from the hands of the Japanese invaders, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have intensified production and construction and improved the people's lives. Now Lüda has become a paradise for the people.

　　During the Japanese occupation, less than 30% of children in the Lüda area were able to attend school, and they received a slave education. Now it is completely different. Under the care and cultivation of the People's Government, we are receiving the new education of the motherland. The number of children entering school has reached more than 93% of school-age children. In order to facilitate the schooling of children of workers and peasants, the People's Government has established scholarships and publicly funded students for us in various schools. In the city, there is a cultural palace for our children. This is where our children seek knowledge. Tens of millions of children's favorite books, picture albums, specimens, scientific instruments, etc., are available for us to study at any time. Every Saturday night, we jump and skip to participate in the evening party or watch educational movies. In addition, the city has also opened a children's park, which is very large in scale. There are hills, rivers, bridges, and pavilions, as well as various birds and animals, and ingenious toys. When we get there, we always play to our heart's content. Now the students no longer call it "Children's Park" but call it "Children's Paradise."

　　Our school is located in the center of the city. There are more than 2,000 students in the school, and the teachers are kind, enthusiastic, and patiently teaching us. In addition to regular classes every day, we also have many extracurricular activities: gardening labor, running wall newspapers, and various competitions, challenges, and battles, which are very lively. In order to prevent insects from damaging the apples on our trees (the apples in Lüda grow large and sweet and can be called the best in the country), the students responded to the government's call to paste paper bags. More than 95% of our young students have gloriously become members of the Young Pioneers, and the rest are striving to join.

　　Dear children of Hankou! We know that although the areas south of the Yangtze River have not been liberated for a long time, under the leadership of the great Communist Party, we believe that you are also vigorously moving towards the road of construction. We would also like to know a little about your situation and hope you will write to us. Let us unite and learn from each other and serve the people in the future!

　　With best regards,
　　All the students of Class 4, Grade 5, Dalian No. 7 Complete Primary School

### 大连第七完小同学给汉口小朋友的一封信

　　大连第七完小同学给汉口小朋友的一封信亲爱的汉口小朋友们：
    我们全体同学都很想念你们。我们愿以通信方式和你们互相介绍学习生活情形。
    在八一五以前，旅大地区的人民受着日寇的统治，过着暗无天日的生活。自从一九四五年八月十五日，英勇的苏联红军把我们从日寇手里解放出来以后，在共产党领导下，加紧生产建设，改善了人民的生活，现在旅大已变成人民的天堂。
    在日寇统治的时候，旅大区就学的儿童，不到百分之三○，受的是奴化教育。现在已迥然不同了。我们在人民政府的爱护和培养下，接受着祖国的新教育。入学儿童已达到学龄儿童百分之九十三以上了。人民政府为了便利工农子弟的求学，各校为我们设立了奖学金和公费生。在市内，有我们儿童的文化宫。这里正是我们儿童求知识的地方，成千万部的儿童所最爱看的图书、画报，以及标本、科学仪器等，随时可供我们学习。每到星期六晚上，我们都是蹦蹦跳跳的去那里参加晚会，或看有教育意义的电影。另外，市内还辟有儿童公园，规模极大。那里有山丘、河流、桥梁和亭子等，还喂有各种鸟兽，设置着新巧的玩具。我们到了那里，总是尽情的玩。现在同学们都不叫它“儿童公园”，而称它为“儿童乐园”了。
    我们的学校正在市区的中心，校里有两千多个同学，老师都是和蔼热诚耐心地教导我们。我们每天除上正课外，还有许多课外活动：园艺劳动、办壁报，以及各项竞赛、挑战、应战，闹得火热一般。为防止虫子蛀坏我们树上的苹果（旅大的苹果长得大又甜，可称全国第一），同学们响应了政府糊纸袋的号召。我们小同学们有百分之九十五以上都已光荣的做了少年儿童队队员，其余的都在争取入队。
    亲爱的汉口小朋友们！我们知道长江以南的地区虽然解放没有好久，但在伟大的共产党领导下，我们相信也是朝气勃勃地向着建设的大道迈进。我们也想知道你们的一点情形，希望你们给我们写信。大家互相团结，互相学习，将来为人民服务！                      此致敬礼
                            大连第七完全小学五年四班全体同学
