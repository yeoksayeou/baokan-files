　　People Begin to Live a Stable Life
    ——Changsha Under Stable Prices

    The Laboring Masses Are Relieved of Worries About Their Livelihood

    "The world has changed" - the people of Hunan are beginning to look at this new era with new eyes. They believe that the People's Government has a solution: "Prices have been stabilized." People's lives are stable, the market situation is improving, and everything is moving in a new direction. The people bid farewell with excitement to the twelve years of suffering from inflation. A farmer in Changsha County said: "This is thanks to Chairman Mao's blessing."

    From mid-March to the end of April, in just over a month, prices fell by thirty-six percent, which means the value of the Renminbi increased by thirty-six percent. The general trend of prices in the eight major cities of the province is to maintain a relatively stable state. People from all walks of life have breathed a sigh of relief, especially workers who rely on wages and the broad masses of laboring people, who are relieved of their worries about their livelihoods. In the past, professors at Hunan University, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, had to rush across the river to buy silver dollars or buy rice together after receiving their salaries. Now they don't have these troubles and are beginning to live a peaceful life that they haven't had in twelve years. The workers of the Hunan Machinery Factory used to have the mentality of "spending it all in three days" when prices fluctuated. When they received their salaries, work in the factory virtually stopped, and everyone rushed to buy things, grabbing whatever they could, whether they needed it or not, buying handfuls of toothbrushes, and spending the rest of their money in restaurants. Now, they say: After receiving their salaries, they don't need to worry about those things anymore. They hide their money and are reluctant to spend it, and their enthusiasm for production is particularly high. The workshops no longer hear complaints about prices.

    This is a big change, and people from all walks of life are showing infinite joy.

    I asked some employees of private banks and money shops, and they said: In the past, "one-night, two-meal" deposits were frequent, and it was too troublesome to count the bills. Now there are more fixed deposits, and the work is easier than before. Jiang Zhonghe, a technician at the Changsha Maintenance Plant, and his family of six, could hardly buy six dou of rice with a month's salary during the rule of the Jiang bandit gang, which was only enough for him to live on. After liberation, he now receives 120 work points, and his son is learning in the factory, and the family's life is taken care of. In the past, the silver dollar market around Taiping Street in Changsha City was very "prosperous." Recently, I met an old silver dollar dealer, Wang, and asked, "What's the price of 'zao bizi' (silver dollar slang)?" He said, "Now we are doing small business honestly, washing our hands of it, and we can be clean people. We are steady and make a little at a time. The previous 'road' was too risky and not for humans."

    Just as Industrialists and Businessmen Have Largely Recognized the Direction

    After price stabilization, the changes in people's lives are significant. For example, in the past, the capitalists in industry and commerce were very worried. They said, "Liberation is good, but the counters are overgrown with grass." Because at that time, when the policy of withdrawing currency was being implemented, prices were constantly falling, and merchants were generally accustomed to the speculative business of the past in hyperinflation. They couldn't change all of a sudden, and they happened to encounter the payment of public debt and the start of spring tax collection, coupled with the spring famine, business was depressed. Special agents took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying: "Chairman Mao has returned from the Soviet Union and wants to implement socialism early." Therefore, various places were depressed, factories stopped work, shops closed, large shops became small shops, and residential merchants became traveling merchants. Later, state-owned trading organizations provided strong support, actively adjusting prices, processing, ordering, agency sales and other measures. At the same time, the People's Government began to adjust the relationship between public and private sectors, convened meetings with people from industrial and commercial circles, corrected tax deviations, and granted postponement of payment or reduction of burdens according to actual conditions. The views of industrialists and businessmen also changed, and concerns have gradually been eliminated. A businessman in Changsha City said at a symposium: "I only believed in the People's Government by two or three points at the beginning of liberation. At the end of last year, I believed by five points, and this year I believed by eight points. Today, I believe by ten points." Now, many legitimate industrialists and businessmen have recognized the direction and know that to solve the difficulties of production and business, the capitalists must improve management methods, the labor side must give play to their enthusiasm for production, and both sides must work together to overcome the difficulties. Now the market is developing gradually normally, and the industrial and commercial situation is beginning to improve. In particular, after the announcement of the policy of adjusting industry and commerce and implementing the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, it greatly encouraged their enthusiasm for active management. Various places have organized joint ventures and labor-capital consultation meetings, and some have raised funds to expand production equipment. Retail and wholesale business has also tended to be active. For example, the daily sales of Changsha Private Yisheng Cloth Shop in May reached about 10 million yuan, more than double the past. The phenomenon of some industrial products losing money began to be reversed. For example, from February 22 to the end of April, Changsha Guangda Dyeing and Weaving Factory lost more than 34 million yuan. Deng Jimei, the manager of the factory, had participated in the Northward Visit Group. Seeing the development of industry and commerce in Northeast and North China, he was very confident in his own business. He improved management, improved labor-capital relations, and implemented savings. As a result, production increased day by day, and by May, income and expenditure were close to balance, and now it is beginning to be profitable. Recently, I met some people in the industrial and commercial circles. They were all smiling and not as sad and full of complaints as before. They all said that business is easier to do after the price is stable. There is also a gratifying phenomenon: the development of closed factories has tended to stop. According to statistics from the Changsha Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, more than 400 industrial and commercial households were approved for closure in April, and only more than 360 were closed in May, and 152 were opened. However, the funds for opening increased by 44.4% compared with the funds for closure. Moreover, in the last week, 87 households applied for opening, which is currently under review. Recently, more than 50 households have automatically withdrawn their applications for closure. Businessmen in Hengyang said: "The current difficulties are temporary. As long as we see that the People's Government is so capable of dealing with prices, we can believe that it will also be able to deal with national economic construction."

### 人们开始过着安定的日子——物价稳定下的长沙

　　人们开始过着安定的日子
    ——物价稳定下的长沙
    罗厚仁
    劳动群众解除了生活上的顾虑
    “世界变了”——湖南人民开始用新的眼光来看这个新的时代。他们相信人民政府是有办法的：“物价硬是平住了”。人民生活安定，市场情况好转，一切都在朝着新的方向迈进。人民怀着兴奋的心情向十二年来受通货煎熬的日子告别了。长沙县的一个农民说：“这是享毛主席的福。”
    从三月中到四月底止，一个多月的工夫，物价下降了百分之三十六，也就是人民币的币值提高了百分之三十六。全省八个主要城市物价总的趋势，是保持相对平稳的状态。各阶层人民都感到松了一口气，特别是依靠薪水过日子的工人以及广大劳动群众，解除了生活上的顾虑。湖南大学的教授们过去在国民党反动统治时期，发了薪水以后，就要赶快过河来买光洋或合伙买米，现在没有这些麻烦了，开始过着十二年来所未有的安静的日子。湖南机械厂的职工们，在物价波动时是抱着“发饷三天冲”的心理，到发薪水时，厂里工作无形停顿，大家都抢购东西去了，不管需要与否一把抓，牙刷买上把数，剩下一点钱也要进馆子把它吃光。现在，他们说：发了薪水，用不着操那些空心了，都把票子藏在身边舍不得用，生产情绪也特别高，工场里也再听不到为物价而发的牢骚了。
    这是一个大的转变，各阶层人民，都表现无限的欢欣。
    我问一些私营银行钱庄的职员，他们说：过去“一宿两餐”的存款，出进频繁，清点票子太麻烦，现在定期存款多了，工作比以前轻松。长沙保养场技工蒋中和他一家六口人，过去在蒋匪帮统治时期，一个月工资难买六斗米，只够他一个人生活，解放后，现在他拿一二○个工薪分，儿子在厂里学习，一家人的生活都解决了。过去长沙市太平街一带的银元市场是很“繁荣”的，最近我碰到一个银元贩子王老头，问“遭鼻子（即银元暗语）什么价”？他说：“现在我们规规矩矩做小生意了，洗手不干，可以做个清白人了，稳扎稳打，赚一个算一个，以前那个“路”风险大，不是人干的。”
    正当工商业家大都认清了方向
    物价稳定以后，人民生活的变化是很大的。例如：过去工商业的资方顾虑很深，他们说：“解放好是好，柜头长青草”。因为那时正当执行回笼政策的时候，物价不断下落，一般商人习惯于过去在通货膨胀中的投机经营，一下转变不过来，恰巧又碰上公债交款、春季税收开征，加之春荒时期，生意萧条。特务便乘机造谣说：“毛主席从苏联回来，要提早实行社会主义”。因此各地都呈现不景气，工厂停工，商店关门，大店变小店，住商变行商。后来，国营贸易机关大力扶助，主动调整价格、加工、订货、代销等措施，同时人民政府开始调整公私关系，召集工商界人士开会，纠正税收偏向，根据实际情况给予延期缴纳或减轻负担，工商业家的看法也转变了，顾虑已逐渐消除。长沙市有个商人在座谈会上说：“我在解放之初只有两三分相信人民政府，去年年底相信五分，今年相信八分，今天才十分相信了。”现在很多正当工商业者都已认清了方向，知道要解决生产和业务的困难，必须资方改善经营方法，劳方发挥生产积极性，双方协力才能度过难关。现在市场发展渐趋正常，工商业情况开始好转。特别是调整工商业，贯彻公私兼顾、劳资两利政策的方针宣布后，更大大鼓舞了他们积极经营的热情，各地纷纷组织联营及劳资协商会，有的则调集资金，扩充生产设备。零售和批发生意也已趋向活跃。如：长沙私营益盛细布庄五月份每日的销货额达千万元左右，较过去增加一倍多。部分工业品亏本的现象开始扭转过来。如：长沙广大染织工厂，自二月二十二日至四月底结算，赔本三千四百多万，该厂经理邓济美曾参加北上参观团，他看到东北和华北一带工商业发展的情形，对自己经营的事业很有信心，就进行改善经营，搞好劳资关系，实行节约，因而产量日益增加，到五月间收支已接近平衡，现在开始已有利可获了。最近碰到一些工商业界，他们一个个笑逐颜开，不像以前那样愁眉苦脸满腹牢骚，他们都说物价稳定后，生意好做些了。还有一个可喜的现象：就是歇业厂商发展已趋停止。据长沙市工商局统计，四月份批准歇业的工商业户达四百家以上，五月份歇业的只有三百六十余家，开业的一五二家，开业的资金却比歇业的资金增加了百分之四十四点四。而且最后一周还有八十七户申请开业，现正审核中。最近自动撤回歇业申请书的有五十余家。衡阳的商人说：“目前困难是暂时的，只要看人民政府对物价这样有办法，就可相信对国家经济建设也一定会有办法的。”
