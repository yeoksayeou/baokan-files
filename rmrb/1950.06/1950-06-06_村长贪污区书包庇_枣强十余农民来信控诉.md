　　Village Chief Embezzles, District Secretary Protects
    More Than Ten Farmers in Zaoqiang Complain in Letters
    To the Editor:
    We are a group of farmers from Dateng Village, Eighth District, Zaoqiang County, Hebei Province. We now have something to tell you, and we ask you to help us solve it.
    Our village's Ruan Dezhen, during his tenure as village chief from April 1948 to July 1949, embezzled multiple times. In June 1948, he levied half a jin of wheat per mu of land as a corvée grain, which should have amounted to more than 600 jin, but he over-collected more than 270 jin. Two or three months later, he again levied half a jin of millet per mu of land as a corvée grain, collecting over 900 jin of millet. The other village cadres and the masses knew nothing about this collection. When someone asked him, "What is this collection for?" he actually said, "For wine and meat money!" The masses dared to be angry but dared not speak out. In October, he levied corvée grain for the third time. Everyone asked, "What is this for? What if people don't want to pay?" He said, "Whoever refuses to pay, the militia will detain them and send them to the district, and there will be a solution." So he announced, "Collect twelve taels of rice per mu of land, for a total of one thousand four to five hundred jin for the whole village." When it came to the third *lü* (a unit of area), farmer Dong Jinzhuo asked him about the purpose of this corvée grain. He again said it was for "wine and meat money." Dong Jinzhuo said, "Didn't the district say not to levy corvée? Let me go to the district to ask first, and if the district tells me to pay, I will pay." Ruan Dezhen slapped Dong Jinzhuo twice and ordered the militia to detain him, forcing him to pay the corvée grain. Dong Jinzhuo reported this situation to the district government, but the district cadres had long been inseparable from Ruan Dezhen in eating and drinking, and instead punished him by making him keep watch at night. As a result, no one dared to speak again. In January 1949, Ruan Dezhen levied corvée grain for the fourth time, requiring one jin per mu of land. Many households with difficulties requested to pay after selling their goods. Ruan Dezhen then invited district cadre Wang Changqi to urge collection, and took Dong Jinzhang, the director of the Armed Forces Committee (one of the households requesting deferred payment), to the district, demanding that he pay the grain. In February, Ruan Dezhen again asked the village to provide stretchers and apportioned "comfort money" of one hundred yuan per mu of land. But in the end, the stretchers did not go, and the so-called comfort money of 170,000 yuan was all embezzled by him.
    In addition, he also sold the village's large bell (converted to 500 jin of millet), the large beam in the temple (converted to more than 140 jin of millet), and the temple bricks (selling price unknown).
    In March 1949, when the People's Liberation Army passed through our area, they borrowed grain and firewood from the local area. At that time, our village borrowed two eggs from each household, totaling more than 200 eggs. But Ruan Dezhen only gave 80 to the district government, and he ate the rest. At the same time, the egg money received from the district government was also spent by Ruan Dezhen. The village also borrowed 500 jin of millet, and the army issued a voucher. Later, when the villagers went to the district to collect the millet, the district government said that our village still owed public grain and withheld the voucher. On April 30, the villagers asked the *lü* head for the millet. The director of the Armed Forces Committee also went to ask the village chief. Village chief Ruan Dezhen said, "Let's go to the district to discuss it tomorrow!" The next day, he invited district cadres Sun Jinchun and Chang Shuwen to our village to hold a mass meeting, only talking about production matters. After the meeting, the masses asked again, "What about our millet?" The village chief did not answer. District cadre Chang Shuwen scolded the people for making trouble and said that whoever wanted the millet was a bad kid. Everyone said, "Didn't the district say before that the borrowed millet would be returned?" The district cadre replied, "Whoever wants millet, come over here. Are you rebelling? No one can leave!" Chang Shuwen went to Majiazhuang to call for armed militia, forcing the masses to say who was the initiator. The masses said, "We all asked the *lü* head for the millet." The district cadre had no choice but to let the masses leave. The next day, when everyone was busy with the wheat harvest, the district called the *lü* head and other village cadres to ask, "Who is the initiator?" At that time, everyone dared not speak. On July 1st, during the autumn harvest, District Committee Secretary Zhang and four or five district cadres came to the village and held a mass meeting. In advance, they also transferred the militia from Majia Village and Si Shang Village. At the meeting, he detained village chief Ruan Dezhen and Armed Forces Committee Director Dong Jinzhang. The village cadres asked, "What mistake did the Armed Forces Committee Director make?" He said, "You all have made mistakes, reflect on it!" Village chief Ruan Dezhen was only detained for three to five days, and the district did not investigate his embezzlement and released him. On July 11, the district dismissed both of them. On July 12, the District Committee Secretary brought four district cadres to the village to conclude the case, convened an accounting committee to calculate Ruan Dezhen's embezzlement accounts. But Ruan Dezhen's accounts were all just wine money and meat money, all large accounts, not knowing who ate and drank it. There were no receipts or dates. Everyone calculated for seven or eight days, but could not come to a conclusion. The District Committee Secretary protected him everywhere, not considering him as an embezzler. He said, "These accounts were made by him in three or two days, you don't need to calculate them." The accounting committee said, "If the accounts are not cleared, we cannot explain to everyone!" The District Committee Secretary handed the list to Ruan Dezhen and said to everyone, "I have no way to solve this problem. Whoever feels wronged, go to the county to sue Ruan Dezhen! But don't go in groups, that is illegal." The people went to the county several times, but did not get any results.

    Editor's note: The above letter was brought to this newspaper by a working comrade of the Fourth Bureau of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission. It is said that mailing it would risk interception by local cadres. This shows how serious the bad habit of suppressing criticism is among local district and village cadres! At the same time, village chief Ruan Dezhen violated government decrees, repeatedly arbitrarily apportioning taxes in the village, embezzling and enriching himself. The district government and the district committee initially did not interfere, but instead protected him; later, they did not seriously investigate and deal with it. This style of embezzlement, dereliction of duty, and suppression of criticism must be corrected. The Zaoqiang County Government and the County Committee must quickly investigate and deal with this matter, and publish the results of the handling in this newspaper.

　　村长贪污区书包庇
    枣强十余农民来信控诉编辑同志：
    我们是河北省枣强县第八区大滕村的一群农民。我们现在有一件事情要告诉你们，请你们帮我们解决。
    我村阮德贞，在一九四八年四月到一九四九年七月担任村长期间，曾贪污过多次。一九四八年六月间，他派差米每亩地派麦子半斤，应收六百多斤，但他多收了二百七十多斤。二、三个月以后，他又派差米每亩地小米半斤，共收了小米九百余斤。这次收米，村里其他干部和群众都不知道。有人问他：“这次收米是干什么用的？”他竟说：“酒钱肉钱！”群众都敢怒而不敢言。十月间，他第三次派差米。大家问：“这是干什么用的？要是大家不肯出怎么办？”他说：“谁不肯出，叫民兵把他扣起来，送到区里就有办法。”于是他就宣布：“每亩地收十二两米，全村共收一千四五百斤。”收到第三闾时，农民董金琢问他这次差米的用途。他又说是“酒钱肉钱。”董金琢说：“区里不是说不叫派差吗？让我先到区里去问一下，区里叫我出我就出。”阮德贞就打了董金琢两个嘴巴，并叫民兵把他扣起来，强迫他缴了差米。董金琢到区政府反映这个情况，谁知区干部早就和阮德贞吃喝不分，反而罚他在晚上打更。这样一来，老百姓谁也不敢再讲话了。一九四九年一月，阮德贞第四次派差米。每亩地要出一斤。有许多花户因为实在困难，要求等卖了东西再缴。阮德贞便请区干部王长起来催收，并把武委会主任董金章（要求缓交的花户之一）带到区里，要他把米缴上。二月，阮德贞又要村中出担架，并摊派“慰劳金”每亩地一百元。但结果，担架没走成，所谓慰劳金十七万元，也都被他私吞了。
    此外，他又变卖了村中的大钟（折小米五百斤）、庙中的大梁（折小米一百四十多斤）和庙砖（卖价不明）。
    一九四九年三月间，人民解放军经过我们地区时，向当地借粮食、柴火。当时我们村子每户借出鸡蛋两个，全村共借鸡蛋二百多个。但是阮德贞只交给区政府八十个，其余的鸡蛋都被他吃了。同时从区政府领来的鸡蛋钱，也被阮德贞花了。村中又借出小米五百斤，由军队出了借条。后来村人到区上去领米时，区政府说我村还欠着公粮，就把条子扣下了。四月三十日，村民向闾长要米。武委会主任也去问村长。村长阮德贞说：“明天到区上去讨论一下吧！”第二天，他请区干部孙金春、昌书文到本村来开群众大会，只谈生产的事情。会后群众又问：“我们的米怎样？”村长不答复。区干部昌书文竟骂老百姓捣乱，并说谁要米就是坏小子。大伙说：“以前区上不是说过借米一定还吗？”区干部回答说：“谁要米就过来。你们造反了？谁都不能走！”昌书文到马家庄去叫来武装民兵，逼迫群众说出谁是主动人。群众说：“是我们大家找闾长要米的。”区干部没办法，就让群众走了。第二天，大家正忙着麦收，区上把闾长和其他村干部叫去，问：“倒底谁是主动人？”时，大家都不敢说话。到七月初一，正是秋忙期间，区委书记张同志带了四、五个区干部到村子里，召开群众大会。事前把马家村和寺上村的民兵也调来了。开会时他把村长阮德贞和武委会主任董金章扣了起来。村干部们问：“武委会主任犯了什么错误？”他说：“你们都有错误，好好反省一下吧！”村长阮德贞只被扣了三五天，区上没有追问他贪污的事情，就把他放了。七月十一，区上把他们两人都撤职了。七月十二，区委书记带了四个区干部到村上来结束这个案子，召开了算账委员会，来算阮德贞的贪污账。可是阮德贞的账上只是什么酒钱肉钱，全是大笔账，不知道是谁吃喝的。既没有凭据，也没有日期。大家算了七八天，也算不出个结果。区委书记竟处处为他掩护，不认为他是贪污。他说：“这账是他三两天内造的，你们不用算了。”算账委员会说：“账不算清，我们不能向大伙交待！”区委书记便把清单交给阮德贞，并向大家说：“这问题我没有办法解决。你们谁觉得受了冤，就去县上告阮德贞吧！但是不要成群结伙的去，那是违法的。”老百姓曾到县里去了几次，也得不到什么结果。

    编者按：上面这封信是当地农民托人民革命军事委员会四局一个工作同志带给本报的。据说，邮寄怕被当地干部扣留。这说明了当地区村干部压制批评的恶劣作风何等严重！同时村长阮德贞违反政府法令，一再向该村擅自摊派，贪污中饱，区政府和区委会初则不加干涉，反加包庇；以后也没有认真查办。这种贪污渎职、压制批评的作风，必须加以纠正。枣强县政府和县委会必须迅速查究处理此事，并在本报公布处理结果。
