Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a statement on the situation in Japan on June 12th. The full text is as follows:

The American imperialist MacArthur, abusing the power of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, ordered the Japanese Yoshida government on June 6th to "purge" all members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, including Tokuda Kyuichi, Nosaka Sanzo, and 24 others. On June 7th, he ordered the Yoshida government to "purge" staff of the Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, Akahata, and Japanese Communist Party Diet member, Kikunami Katsumi, and 17 others. He also began arresting Japanese communists and other patriotic elements throughout Japan.

The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that this action by the American imperialists and their Japanese lackeys completely violates the Potsdam Declaration issued jointly by China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States in 1945 to Japan, and completely violates the "Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan" announced by the Far Eastern Commission. Therefore, it is completely illegal. The Chinese Communist Party resolutely condemns the illegal atrocities of MacArthur and the Yoshida government, warmly sympathizes with the just resistance of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese patriotic people against the illegal atrocities of MacArthur and the Yoshida government, and demands that all the people of China, all the people of Asia, and all the people of the world unanimously support the Japanese Communist Party and the patriotic people of Japan.

The American imperialists' policy toward Japan is to transform Japan into an American colony and a new base for aggressive war. This policy harms the common interests of the Japanese people, the Chinese people, and all the people of Asia and the world. Under the call of the Japanese Communist Party, the patriotic people of Japan are uniting to oppose the American aggressors and the Japanese traitors in order to achieve a swift and comprehensive peace treaty between Japan and the Allied Powers and to achieve the liberation of the Japanese people. This is the real motivation behind MacArthur and the Yoshida government's suppression of the Japanese Communist Party and the patriotic people of Japan.

For the same motivation, the American imperialists are instigating reactionary governments in Australia, the Philippines, West Germany, South Africa, and other places to declare the Communist Party illegal, and have already ordered reactionary governments in Bolivia, Panama, Venezuela, and other countries to do so recently. The American imperialist government tyrannically persecutes the American Communist Party and sentenced the General Secretary of the American Communist Party, Dennis, to imprisonment, precisely because the American Communist Party dares to stand at the forefront of the American people in opposing the aggressive policy of its own imperialist government.

The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the American imperialists are attempting to drive the Communist Party underground in all places within their reach, in order to clear obstacles for their preparation of a new war of aggression. This can never stop the advance of the great just movement of the world for lasting peace, people's democracy, and social progress. The history since the advent of the communist movement, especially the history since the Second World War, runs completely counter to all the delusions of the reactionaries of the past, the imperialists of all countries, and the current American imperialists. The history of the reactionaries is the history of failure, and the history of the revolutionary people is the history of victory. Reactionaries sometimes seem very rampant and achieve some "victories" in suppressing the people, but in the end, they all fail. Revolutionary people sometimes suffer some setbacks, but in the end, they all win. The history of the whole world is written in this way, without exception. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution is the most recent evidence. Now the strength of the world peace and democracy camp is growing stronger, and the united front of the oppressed peoples of all countries against imperialism is developing. These facts make people confident that the ultimate failure is inevitable for the heinous American imperialism and its running dogs, and the revolutionary struggles of the Japanese people and the peoples of all countries will always be victorious.

### 中共中央发表声明  斥责麦克阿瑟和吉田政府非法暴行  号召全国人民声援日共和日本人民

　　中共中央发表声明
    斥责麦克阿瑟和吉田政府非法暴行
    号召全国人民声援日共和日本人民
    【新华社十二日讯】中国共产党中央委员会十二日发表关于日本情势的声明，全文如下：
    美国帝国主义者麦克阿瑟滥用盟军驻日统帅的权力，在六月六日下令日本吉田政府“整肃”日本共产党中央委员会全体委员德田球一、野坂参三等二十四人，在六月七日又下令吉田政府“整肃”日本共产党机关报赤旗报职员和日本共产党众议员听涛克己等十七人，并在日本各地开始逮捕日本共产党人和其他爱国分子。
    中国共产党中央委员会认为美国帝国主义者及其日本走狗的这种行动，完全违背中苏英美四国在一九四五年联名对日本发布的波茨坦宣言，完全违背远东委员会所宣布的“日本投降后对日基本政策”，因此是完全非法的。中国共产党坚决斥责麦克阿瑟和吉田政府的非法暴行，热烈同情日本共产党和日本爱国人民对于麦克阿瑟和吉田政府的非法暴行的正义反抗，并且要求全中国人民全亚洲人民和全世界人民一致声援日本共产党和日本的爱国人民。
    美国帝国主义者的对日政策，就是变日本为美国殖民地和新侵略战争基地的政策。这个政策危害日本人民、中国人民以及全亚洲和全世界人民的共同利益。日本爱国人民在日本共产党的号召之下，正在团结起来，反对美国侵略者和日本卖国贼，以求得日本与同盟国迅速全面媾和，以求得日本人民的解放。这就是麦克阿瑟和吉田政府镇压日本共产党和日本爱国人民的真实动机。
    由于同样的动机，美国帝国主义者正在策动澳大利亚、菲律宾、西德、南非等地反动政府宣布共产党为非法，并已经命令玻利维亚、巴拿马、委内瑞拉等国反动政府在最近这样做了。美国帝国主义政府横暴地迫害美国共产党，将美国共产党总书记但尼斯判处徒刑，也就是因为美国共产党敢于站在美国人民的最前面反对本国的帝国主义政府的侵略政策。
    中国共产党中央委员会认为：美国帝国主义企图在其力之所及的一切地方将共产党驱入地下，以便扫清其准备新侵略战争的障碍。这决不能停止全世界争取持久和平、人民民主和社会进步的伟大正义运动的前进。自有共产主义运动以来的历史，特别是世界第二次大战以来的历史，都是和历来的反动派，和各国帝国主义，和现在的美国帝国主义的一切妄想背道而驰。反动派的历史都是失败的历史，革命人民的历史都是胜利的历史。反动派有时也显得很猖獗，取得一些镇压人民的“胜利”，但最后无不失败。革命人民有时也会遭受一些挫折，但最后无不胜利。全世界的历史都是这样写的，无一例外，中国人民革命的胜利，就是最近的证据。现在世界和平民主阵营的力量日益强大，各国被压迫人民反对帝国主义的统一战线日益发展。这些事实使人们确信：最后失败的必然是穷凶极恶的美国帝国主义及其走狗，日本人民和各国人民的革命斗争总是要胜利的。
