　　Price stability is a prerequisite for developing production and ensuring the lives of the broad masses of the people. The situation of price stability that began in March of this year must be resolutely maintained.
    Price increases are a cruel plunder of the lives of the broad masses of the people, especially the working people, as is well known. But the harm of price increases is more than that. In the context of continuous price fluctuations, general enterprises strive to seek excessive profits from the commodity circulation process, thus diverting social funds from industry to commerce and concentrating them in a few central cities for speculation.
    In the long process of price increases, industrial capital continues to shrink, and the legitimate industry and commerce of small and medium-sized cities continue to shrink, and the social productivity and purchasing power continue to weaken, while a few large cities, due to the active commercial speculation, have created a temporary false prosperity. If this phenomenon is not fundamentally remedied, economic development is impossible. Only when prices are stable can producers let go of expanding reproduction, and social funds can gradually be transferred to the production sector.
    The Chinese People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party have always advocated price stability. However, national prices still experienced four major fluctuations last year. This is because the unprecedented scale of rapid development of the Liberation War last year required unprecedentedly large war expenses, and the government's revenue at that time was far from sufficient to pay for it, so it had to issue more currency to meet the urgent needs. However, were all the losses suffered by the broad masses of the people due to the depreciation of currency used to support the war? No! Only a part of the losses suffered by the people in the process of currency depreciation was transformed into war expenses, and another significant part became the speculative profits of speculators, becoming the sacrificial victims of the decadent luxuries in the cities' false prosperity.
    When the mainland war had basically ended in early 1950 and the fiscal revenue and expenditure had the conditions to approach a balance, the Central People's Government took timely and resolute steps to stabilize prices. The inflation problem, which had plagued the country for more than ten years and which the Kuomintang government had repeatedly announced it would solve but had repeatedly failed to do so, was effectively solved by the People's Government in the shortest period of time. The people of the whole country warmly support this great victory. Although after price stabilization, the social economy that has long been adapted to inflation has to undergo a large-scale reorganization, and a series of difficulties cannot but occur in the process of this reorganization, the people are willing to endure these temporary difficulties and strive to seek all ways to alleviate and overcome these difficulties, and are determined not to go backwards because of this, and to endure the endless difficulties of inflation again.
    This is the basic position that the Chinese people must adhere to on today's financial, monetary, and price issues.
    The reason why this view needs to be repeatedly publicized is that in the current economic difficulties, a very small number of industrialists and businessmen have developed a kind of wavering on this issue. On the one hand, they admit that price increases are detrimental to the national economy, on the other hand, they advocate a slow rise in prices, saying that this can "stimulate production". This view is wrong and must be rejected. The so-called slow price increase is nothing more than gradually implementing inflation, expanding credit, and allowing entrepreneurs who borrow money to profit from the price increase by invisibly plundering the people's wealth. Even so, do Chinese industrialists have a way out? If social purchasing power is constantly weakening, where will industrialists obtain and expand their reliable rather than false markets?
    The view that prices must be stable also needs to be promoted because while the People's Government is trying to reduce the burden on the people, implementing orders and purchasing products from industrialists and farmers, and providing relief to the unemployed and disaster victims, some speculators are maliciously spreading the illusion that prices will rise again. But these illusions are doomed to fail, because all these measures of the People's Government are still limited to maintaining price stability.
    Of course, continuous price declines are also detrimental to production. Continuous price declines will also make producers afraid to expand reproduction, because consumers will hesitate and wait and see, unwilling to buy, merchants will be unwilling to purchase or dare not purchase, and producers' products will not be easily sold, and the selling price will not be easy to maintain costs. The stagnation of production caused in this way is of course also detrimental to the entire people. From April of this year, prices in major cities across the country began to decline. By the end of May, the average price in the seven major cities across the country had fallen by 22% (taking March as 100). This decline, on the one hand, increased the purchasing power of the money saved by the broad masses of the people and struck a blow to the speculative merchants who should be hit, but at the same time brought many difficulties to general industrialists and businessmen. The People's Government, standing on the position of the people's interests, strives for price stability and avoids price declines. Therefore, during the period of price declines, state trading companies have tried their best to hold the listed prices in order to stabilize the market. However, due to the large amount of depreciated goods sold by hoarders, the power of state trading companies can only reduce the degree and speed of price declines, but cannot make prices not fall at all.
    Guaranteeing long-term price stability is a necessary part of the People's Government's general policy of developing production and promoting economic prosperity. Now prices are only close to stability, and they are not already immune to fluctuations. In order to achieve the ultimate goal of price stability, serious efforts are still needed. It should be pointed out that the speculative capital in the country has not been completely transformed, and the power of speculation is still latent. If the government is slightly negligent, or if there is a partial imbalance in the supply and demand of certain materials, price fluctuations are still possible. Especially in the newly liberated rural areas, although the Renminbi has begun to go to the countryside, there are no strong state-owned economic institutions and cooperatives to control market prices there. Therefore, the Renminbi may still be squeezed back to the cities, and the possibility of price fluctuations is even greater. Therefore, we must continue to work hard to completely control various prices across the country. However, in any case, the main daily necessities of the people's lives across the country are no longer in the hands of speculators, but in the hands of the government, and some major industrial raw materials have also been mastered by the government. Under these circumstances, if any speculator dares to take risks and be an enemy of the people, he will only be waiting for the fate of bankruptcy.
    The staff of financial organs, state trading organs, and cooperatives at all levels, patriotic industrialists and businessmen, and all the people should recognize that the current situation of price stability has been achieved through arduous efforts. We should use all methods to jointly consolidate this victory and strive to achieve the ultimate goal of price stability.

### 为物价完全稳定而努力

　　为物价完全稳定而努力
    物价稳定，是发展生产与保障广大人民生活的先决条件。今年三月开始的物价稳定的局面，必须坚决的加以保持。
    物价高涨对于广大人民，尤其是劳动人民的生活，是残酷的掠夺，是众所周知的。但是物价高涨的毒害还不止此。在物价不断波动的情况下，一般企业就争着从商品的流通过程中追求超额利润，因而使社会资金不流入工业而流入商业，并且集中于几个中心都市作投机活动。
    在长期的物价高涨过程中，工业资本不断地萎缩，中小城市的正当工商业也不断地萎缩，社会的生产力和购买力不断地削弱，而少数大城市却因商业投机的活跃，造成了暂时的虚假的繁荣。这种现象如不从根本上加以救治，经济的发展是不可能的。只有物价稳定了，生产者才能放手进行扩大再生产，社会的资金才能逐渐转移到生产部门来。
    中国人民政府和中国共产党从来是主张物价平稳的。但是去年全国物价仍然发生了四次大波动。这是因为去年解放战争的空前规模的迅速发展，需要空前庞大的战费，而当时人民政府的收入却远不足以支付，因而不能不较多地增发通货来应付迫切的需要。但是，是不是广大人民因币值跌落而遭受的损失，都是支援了战争呢？不是的！人民在币值跌落过程中所受的损失，只有一部分是转变为战费，而另外的不小的一部分，却变成投机家的投机利润了，变成都市虚假繁荣中酒绿灯红的牺牲品了。
    当一九五○年初大陆战争已基本上结束，财政收支已有条件可以接近平衡的时候，中央人民政府就及时地采取了坚决的步骤来稳定物价。十多年来贻害全国，国民党政府多次宣布要加以解决而多次失败了的通货膨胀问题，人民政府在最短期间就有效地解决了。对于这个伟大的胜利，全国人民是热烈拥护的。虽然在物价稳定以后，长期适应于通货膨胀的社会经济不能不进行一个大规模的改组，而在这个改组过程中间又不能不发生一系列的困难，但是人民是宁愿忍受这些暂时的困难，并且努力寻求一切方法来减轻和克服这些困难，而决不愿意因此而走回头路，重行去忍受通货膨胀的无穷的困难的。
    这是中国人民在今天的财政金融物价问题上所必须坚持的基本立场。
    这个观点之所以需要反复宣传，是因为在目前的经济困难中，有极少数工商业家在这个问题上发生了一种动摇。他们一方面承认物价上涨不利于国民经济，另一方面又主张物价缓慢上升，说是可以借此“刺激生产”。这种意见是错误的，是必须拒绝的。所谓物价缓慢上升，不外是逐步实施通货膨胀，扩展信用，使借款的企业家由于无形地掠夺人民财富而坐得涨价的利益。即令如此，中国的工业家是不是就有了出路呢？社会购买力不断地削弱，工业家从那里去取得和扩大他们的可靠的而不是虚伪的市场呢？
    所以需要宣传物价必须稳定的观点，还因为当人民政府正在设法减轻人民的负担，向工业家和农民实行订货和收购产品，并救济失业者和灾民的时候，有些投机家又在恶意地散布物价将从新高涨的幻想。但是这些幻想是要落空的，因为人民政府的这一切措施，仍然是以保持物价稳定为界限的。
    当然，物价不断下跌，对于生产事业也是不利的。物价不断下跌也会使生产者不敢进行扩大再生产，因为消费者将要徘徊观望，不愿购买，商人将不愿进货或不敢进货，生产者的生产品将不易脱售，而售价也不易维持成本。这样造成的生产事业停滞，对于全体人民当然也是不利的。从今年四月开始，全国各大都市的物价开始下跌，至五月底止，全国七大都市物价平均（以三月为一○○）下跌百分之二二，这种下跌一方面固然提高了广大人民所存货币的购买力，打击了应该打击的投机商人，但同时也带给一般工商业家很多的困难。人民政府站在人民利益的立场上，是力求物价平稳而避免物价大跌的，因此，在物价下跌期间，国家贸易公司曾竭力拉住牌价，以求稳定市场。但由于囤户大量地贬价抛售物资，国家贸易公司的力量，就只能减少物价下落的程度和速度，而不能使物价完全不下跌罢了。
    保证物价长期稳定，是人民政府发展生产、繁荣经济的总政策的一个必要部分。现在物价只是接近稳定，并不是已经再不会波动了。为了达到物价最后稳定的目的，现在还需要作严重的努力。应当指出，目前全国的投机资本还没有彻底改造，投机的力量仍然潜伏，如果政府稍有疏忽，或者某些物资发生局部的供求失调，物价的波动还是有可能的。尤其是在新解放的乡村，那里人民币虽开始下乡，但是还没有有力的国营经济机构和合作社来掌握市场物价，因此人民币仍有被挤回城市的可能，物价波动的可能性就更大。因此，必须继续努力，才能完全控制全国各地的各种物价。但是，无论如何，全国人民生活的主要日用必需品已经不操于投机家之手，而操于政府之手了，某些主要工业原料，也已为政府所掌握了。在这种情况下，如果有投机家敢于冒险，与人民为敌，他就只有等着破产的命运。
    各级财政机关、国家贸易机关和合作社的工作人员们，爱国的工商业家们，以及全体人民，都应当认识现在的物价稳定的局面，是经过艰巨努力才得来的，我们应当用一切方法来共同巩固这个胜利，为达到物价最后稳定的目的而努力。
