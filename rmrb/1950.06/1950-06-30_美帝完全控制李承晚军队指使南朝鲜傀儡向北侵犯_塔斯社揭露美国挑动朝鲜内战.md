　　U.S. Imperialism Completely Controls Syngman Rhee's Army, Directing the South Korean Puppet to Invade the North
    TASS Reveals the U.S. Provocation of the Korean War
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 29th] TASS, New York, June 29th: Under the direction of the Syngman Rhee puppet clique, lengthy and tense preparations preceded the adventurous invasion of the Korean People's Democratic Republic. Official statements and newspaper reports published in the United States clearly show that this aggression, which has now been appropriately answered, was by no means a sudden action. Under the command of U.S. Brigadier General Roberts, a military advisory group including more than five hundred U.S. military personnel had been training Syngman Rhee's army in South Korea for many months in preparation for military action.

    New York Times reporter Salivan, who was recently stationed in South Korea, reported from Hong Kong: "Of all the foreign troops trained by U.S. military officers, the South Korean army is the most Americanized. They wear American-style uniforms, ride in American-made vehicles, and carry American-made weapons. After years of intensive training, even their marching style, and in many ways, their every move, is like Americans—so much so that visitors are surprised to think that the U.S. military is still there to take on the occupation duties."

    Salivan, while acknowledging the complete U.S. control over the South Korean puppet armed forces, wrote: "Five hundred U.S. military advisors have desks throughout the Ministry of Defense. They are also assigned to Korean field units, to regiments, and sometimes even to battalions."

    On the eve of the invasion of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, Syngman Rhee's American masters were apparently deeply satisfied with the puppet South Korean army and confident that this army was capable of carrying out the tasks assigned to it. General Roberts repeatedly boasted to American reporters about his "success" in developing the South Korean army.

    On June 5th, the New York Herald Tribune published a telegram from its Seoul correspondent Higgins, which quoted Roberts as saying: "In Korea, U.S. taxpayers have an army that is a good watchdog for safeguarding U.S. investment in the country; it is also the least expensive and most effective force." Roberts also boasted: "The military advisory group is living proof that with the intelligence and intensive 'investment' of just five hundred battle-hardened U.S. officers and soldiers, you can train one hundred thousand people to fight for you."

    Roberts also told Higgins about the details of the "effectiveness" and "morale" of these puppet troops he expected to fight for the United States. Roberts also bluntly described how U.S. soldiers controlled the South Korean army, even down to the battalion level. Roberts said: "If you are going to train foreign troops, you have to decide to bring a large number of cadres, enough to have Americans placed in every layer, including the battalion. I have assigned at least thirteen or fourteen Americans in each division. They work with Korean officers, they live with Korean officers on the front line—at the 38th parallel—together in combat and during rest."

    This description of the role of U.S. "advisors" clearly shows that the situation of the South Korean troops invading the Korean People's Democratic Republic could not have happened without the knowledge and guidance of the American rulers in South Korea.

    The invasion of North Korea occurred less than a week after Wall Street and Washington's special envoy Dulles visited Seoul and told the South Korean "National Assembly" on June 19th that "the free world is watching you." This is significant. Dulles's statement was clearly a signal, hinting that the time for Syngman Rhee's adventure had arrived.

    In his speech, Dulles warned that "compromise" with communism would be "a road to disaster," in other words, a demand to reject the peaceful reunification of North and South Korea.

    Syngman Rhee and his clique have repeatedly issued bellicose declarations for several months, clearly showing their aggressive ambitions towards the Korean People's Democratic Republic.

    Speaking in Seoul on March 1st, Syngman Rhee asserted that he would never know peace and tranquility until Korea was "unified"—presumably unified under the control of the reactionary puppet guided by Washington. This clearly shows that he was confident that his activities to place the entire Korea under imperialist rule would be fully supported by the United States.

    In a speech to the South Korean "National Assembly" on June 19th, during Dulles's visit to Seoul, Syngman Rhee went even further, urging a "hot war" against North Korea.

    Shin Ik-hee, the speaker of the so-called "National Assembly," also made similar bellicose remarks.

    New York Times reporter Salivan had to admit on June 26th: "Almost all the bellicose remarks came from South Korean leaders." Salivan recalled Syngman Rhee's speech on March 1st: "On many occasions, Syngman Rhee has indicated that if Washington had agreed, his army would have already taken the offensive."

### 美帝完全控制李承晚军队指使南朝鲜傀儡向北侵犯  塔斯社揭露美国挑动朝鲜内战

　　美帝完全控制李承晚军队指使南朝鲜傀儡向北侵犯
    塔斯社揭露美国挑动朝鲜内战
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：李承晚傀儡集团在美国的指挥之下，对朝鲜人民民主主义共和国进行冒险的侵略行动之前，曾有长时间的紧张准备。美国国内所发表的一些官方声明和报纸消息明确地显示出：这种目前已受到适当答复的侵略，绝不是一种突然的行动。在美国准将罗伯茨指挥下，包括有五百多个美国军人的军事顾问团，许多月来就在南朝鲜训练李承晚的军队，以准备军事行动。
    不久前曾驻在南朝鲜的纽约时报记者沙利凡，曾自香港报道说：“在经美国军官训练出来的所有外国军队中，南朝鲜军队是最美国化的。他们穿着美国式的军服、乘坐着美制车辆、佩带着美制武器。经过数年来的加紧训练，甚至他们的步法，而且在许多方面，他们的一举一动，都像美国人一样——是这样地相像，以致参观的人会惊愕地以为，美国军队还在那里负担占领勤务呢。”
    沙利凡在承认美国对南朝鲜傀儡武装部队施行完全控制时写道：“五百个美国军事顾问在整个国防部里都有办公桌。他们并被派到朝鲜的野战部队中，派到团里，有时甚至派到营里。”
    在侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的前夕，李承晚的美国主子们显然对傀儡南朝鲜军队深感满意，并自信这个军队有能力来执行分配给它的任务。罗伯茨将军曾屡次向美国记者们吹嘘他在发展南朝鲜军队工作上的“成功”。
    六月五日，纽约先驱论坛报曾刊载其驻汉城记者希金斯发出的一个电讯，内中引证了罗伯茨这样的话：“在朝鲜，美国纳税人有着一支军队，这支军队是看守美国在该国的投资的一头很好的看家狗；也是花钱最少而效果最大的一支兵力。”罗伯茨并夸口说：“军事顾问团就是一个活的证据，说明了只要有五百个久历战场的美国官兵的颖慧而紧张的“投资”，就可以训练出十万个为你打仗的人。”
    罗伯茨并把他指望着会替美国打仗的这些傀儡军队的“效能”和“士气”的详细情形，告诉了希金斯。罗伯茨还赤裸裸地描述美国军人怎样控制着南朝鲜的军队，甚至一直控制到营级。罗伯茨说：“如果你要去训练外国军队，你得打定主意带大批的干部，足使每一层，包括营在内，都有美国人安插在里面。我在每一个师里面至少派了十三个或十四个美国人。他们和朝鲜官佐一块工作，他们和朝鲜官佐一块儿住在前线——在三八线——在作战时和休息时都和他们在一起。”
    这种关于美国“顾问”的作用的描述，清楚地表示：南朝鲜部队入侵朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的情势，如果不是在南朝鲜美国统治者的知悉和指导之下，就不可能发生。
    在华尔街和华盛顿的特使杜勒斯访问汉城并在六月十九日告诉南朝鲜“国民议会”说“自由世界都瞩望着你们”之后不到一个星期，对北朝鲜的入侵便发生了。这一点是意味深长的，杜勒斯的这句话，显然是一个讯号，暗示李承晚的冒险时机已到。
    杜勒斯在他的演说中警告说：和共产主义“妥协”，将是“走向灾祸的道路”，换句话说，也就是要求拒绝南北朝鲜的和平统一。
    李承晚及其集团，好几个月以来，屡次发表好战的宣言，清楚地显示了他们对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的侵略野心。
    李承晚于三月一日在汉城发表演说时，断言他将永远不知道和平与安宁，直到朝鲜“统一”——大约是统一在华盛顿所指导的反动傀儡的控制下——为止。这就清楚地显示了他确信他力求把整个朝鲜置于帝国主义的统治之下的那种活动，将完全获得美国的支持。
    李承晚于六月十九日杜勒斯访问汉城时向南朝鲜“国民议会”发表的演说中，甚至更进了一步，竟力促对北朝鲜进行“热战”。
    所谓“国民议会”的议长申翼熙也同样发表了好战的言论。
    纽约时报记者沙利凡在六月二十六日不得不承认说：“几乎所有一切好战的言论都出自南朝鲜各领袖。”沙利凡追述李承晚三月一日的演说道：“在许多场合，李承晚曾表示：如果华盛顿曾予同意，那么，他的军队就会已经采取攻势。”
