Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The fascist bill proposed by the South African Malan government to the parliament on May 5th, aimed at declaring the Communist Party and progressive groups illegal, passed its first reading in parliament on June 5th.

Once passed by parliament, this bill will be implemented in the Union of South Africa and South West Africa to persecute progressive organizations, individuals, publications, and gatherings. The bill stipulates that the Governor-General may at any time declare any group, individual, publication, or gathering that identifies itself or is deemed to have one of its purposes as engaging in various communist activities, or is deemed to have communist overtones, as an "illegal organization" or "illegal."

The bill further stipulates that the property (including documents) of those declared "illegal organizations" shall be confiscated by the so-called "state." No one may become a member of an "illegal organization" or provide support in any way. Existing members or supporters must immediately sever their original ties and be deprived of certain civil rights, such as not being allowed to serve as members of parliament, provincial councils, legislative councils, and certain public bodies in South Africa or South West Africa, or hold certain public offices. If the person concerned was originally a member of the aforementioned bodies, they must resign immediately.

The bill grants specially appointed government officials the privilege of enforcing police rule: they can arbitrarily search any agency or residence and interrogate any person. If the person concerned is deemed to be "resisting or failing to fully comply with their inquiries and requests," they may be sentenced to a maximum of ten years in prison and fined 250 pounds. If the person concerned is not a citizen of South Africa or South West Africa, they will be deported.

　　南非政府迫害进步人民  议会初读通过反动法案
    【新华社十六日讯】南非马兰政府于五月五日向议会提出的旨在宣布共产党及进步团体为非法的法西斯法案，已于六月五日在议会一读通过。
    这个法案经议会通过后，即将施行于南非联邦和西南非地区，以迫害进步组织、人士、出版物和集会。该法案规定：凡自认或被认为以进行共产主义各种活动为其宗旨之一，或被认为具有共产主义色彩的团体、人士、出版物、集会，总督得随时宣布其为“非法组织”或“犯法”。
    该法案又规定：被宣布为“非法组织”的财产（包括文件），由所谓“国家”没收。任何人不得成为“非法组织”的成员，或用任何方法给予支持，原有成员或支持者必须立即断绝原有关系，并被褫夺一定的公权，诸如不得充当南非或西南非的议会、省议会、立法议会及某些公共团体的成员，或担任某些公职。假使当事人原是上述机关的成员，便须立即辞职。
    该法案授予政府特派官员以执行警察统治的特权：可以任意搜查任何机关、住宅，审讯任何人士。当事人只要被认为是“抗拒或未尽力满足其询问与要求”，便得被处以最高十年的徒刑，并被课以二百五十镑的罚金。若当事人非南非或西南非公民，则将被驱逐出境。
