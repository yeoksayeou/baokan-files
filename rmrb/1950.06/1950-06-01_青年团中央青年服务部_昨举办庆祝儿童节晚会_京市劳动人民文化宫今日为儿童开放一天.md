　　Held Children's Day Celebration Evening
　　Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace Opens to Children for One Day Today
　　[Our Newspaper] Yesterday—on the eve of the "June 1st" International Children's Day, the Youth Service Department held a celebration evening. More than 3,400 children gathered in the square in front of the department to celebrate the festival. Because this evening was not aimed at school children, most of those who attended were out-of-school children from the general public. The evening began at 8 o'clock. Chairman Liu Xiu reported the significance of holding the celebration evening, and on behalf of the Youth Service Department, extended congratulations to the children attending the meeting, encouraging them to cherish the spring of their lives; and called on every child to persuade his parents to sign the peace declaration. Zheng Yan of the Children's Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Fan Baoyun of the Youth Service Department, and Du Yunsheng, a member of the Children's Team of Huiwen Middle School, spoke successively. After the speeches, the Children's Team of Huiwen Middle School played the harmonica, and the Youth Service Department presented the children with exquisite bookmarks commemorating the famous sayings of great people, and screened two color films donated by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of the Soviet Union to the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China: "Life in the Summer Camp of the Soviet Young Pioneers" and "World Democratic Youth Festival". The evening ended happily at 11 o'clock.
　　[Another News] In order to celebrate the June 1st International Children's Day, the Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace has decided to open the amusement hall and library for one day, welcoming children to play.

    【本报讯】昨天——“六一”国际儿童节前夕，青年服务部举办了庆祝晚会，三千四百余儿童，团聚在该部前面的广场中，欢庆佳节。此次晚会，因不以学校儿童为对象，故到会者多为社会上一般失学儿童。晚会于八时开始。主席刘修正报告了举办庆祝晚会的意义，并代表青年服务部向与会儿童致贺，勉励儿童们珍惜人生的春天；并号召每一个儿童劝告他的父母们在和平宣言上签名。青年团中央少年儿童部郑延、青年服务部范宝云及汇文中学少年儿童队员杜云生相继讲话。讲话完毕后，即由汇文中学少年儿童队演奏口琴，青年服务部赠送给儿童们印有伟人名言的精美书签纪念品，并放映苏联共产主义青年团中央赠给中国新民主主义青年团中央的“苏联少年儿童先锋队夏令营生活”及“世界民主青年联欢大会”两部五彩电影。晚会在十一时尽欢而散。
    【又讯】北京市劳动人民文化宫为了庆祝六一国际儿童节，决定将游艺厅、图书馆开放一天，欢迎小朋友们去玩。
