　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 5th, via Telecommunications Agency: The Bulgarian Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party have recently announced a decree to improve trade measures. The decree emphasizes that the sales of food and industrial products have been continuously increasing. Currently, wholesale trade is directly controlled by the state and cooperatives, with only 14% of retail trade belonging to private merchants. To adapt to the people's ever-increasing purchasing power, the decree stipulates new methods that Bulgarian trade must follow in the future, including plans for commodity exchange, increased variety of goods, and improvements in product quality.

    The decree announces that in the near future, free market prices will be balanced with rationed prices, as a foundation for a comprehensive transition to free trade (i.e., free sales as opposed to rationing).

    The decree further reduces the price of bread on the free market by 25% (the price of bread was reduced by 20% a month ago) and announces that white bread and wheat bread will be available on the market.

    According to TASS on June 9th: The Bulgarian Council of Ministers, in order to further improve the material life of the working people, has decided to reduce the prices of various dairy products by 6% to 23.5%.

    【新华社十二日讯】据电通社索非亚五日讯：保加利亚部长会议及保共中央顷公布改进贸易措施的法令。法令强调指出食品与工业品的销售已不断增加。现在批发贸易已由国家和合作社直接掌握，零售贸易仅有百分之十四属于私营商人。为了适应人民日益提高的购买力，法令规定了保国贸易今后必须遵循的新方法，规定了货物交换的计划、货物种类的增加及货物品质的改善等。
    法令宣布在最近期内，将使自由市场货价与配给货价达到平衡，以作为全面过渡到自由贸易（即与配给制相对的自由发售）的基础。
    法令再度减低了自由市场面包价格百分之二十五（一个月以前面包价格曾减低百分之二十），并且宣布市场上将有白面包和小麦面包出售。
    又据塔斯社九日讯：保加利亚部长会议为更进一步改善劳动人民的物质生活，已决定将各种乳制品的价格削减百分之六到百分之二十三点五。
