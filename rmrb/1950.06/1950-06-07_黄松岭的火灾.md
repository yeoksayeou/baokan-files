    “The Fire at Huangsongling”
    Painting by Su Jian, Poem by Ma Xun
    (4) Old Yan spoke from the sidelines: "Since ancient times, forest farms have had weeds; we've never seen a year or month when they could all be burned away! Right now, the timber transport task (logging) is the most critical. If we stop work to focus on fire prevention, I'm afraid the task won't be completed!" Hearing that "the task might not be completed," the director's heart felt like it was roasting on a fire; he decided Old Yan's view was the best.
    (5) Seeing the director's delighted expression, Old Yan gestured even more emphatically. He said: "Director, Director, come with me. I think: if we do it this way and that way, it's impossible *not* to exceed the task!" The director listened and walked away with him. Leaving Zhao Jinglin, alone and dazed: he thought: "Could it be because I'm so clumsy and inarticulate that the director won't follow my lead?"
    (6) The director returned to the forestry office, and the postman arrived with a letter. Receiving instructions from higher authorities, "It's about preventing spies and fire again, I knew it...." He glanced at it perfunctorily and then called the section chief: "Leave this to you; report back to me when it's done!"
    (7) The director walked into the office and casually picked up a newspaper. At that moment, there was a soft knock at the door, and the section chief came in: "Special instructions have come down from higher authorities; fires have broken out in some places. It seems we can't be careless; shouldn't we send a group of people to thoroughly deal with fire prevention?"

    “黄松岭的火灾”
    苏坚画  马寻诗
    （四）阎怪头一旁开言道：“自古以来林场都有荒草，咱没见过那年那月能全烧掉！现在呀，放洋任务（流送）最紧要。若是停工搞防火，任务怕是完成不了！”听说是“任务怕是完成不了”，所长的心像架上火烤；他认定阎怪头的看法高。
    （五）一看所长喜上眉梢，阎怪头更是指手又划脚。他说：“所长所长，你跟我来，我看哪：这般如此，如此这般，不超过任务那才怪！”所长一面听，一面跟他走开。留下赵景林，独自在那里发呆：他想：“莫非因为咱拙嘴笨腮，所长才不顺着咱的道儿来？”
    （六）所长回到林务所，邮差送信来到了。接过上级指示，“又是防奸防火啊，我早知道……。”他走马观花地看了看，回头就把股长叫：“这事交给你，办完向我来报告！”
    （七）所长走进办公室，顺手取过报。这时门外轻声敲，股长进来了：“上级特别指示下来，有些地方，起了火灾。看样子咱们不能马虎；是不是应当派一批人，把防火彻底搞起来。”    （附图片）
