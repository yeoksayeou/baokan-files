　　To promote superior varieties, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued a "Draft Five-Year Plan for Popularizing Improved Varieties" to all provinces in early April this year, requiring all parts of the country to refer to the draft plan and, based on local conditions, formulate improved variety popularization plans suitable for their respective regions. Because the superior varieties currently propagated by farms are not yet widely available for promotion, the draft plan stipulates that a widespread mass publicity campaign should be the basic work for carrying out variety improvement. According to the provisions of the draft plan: 1950 is the year to lay the foundation for the seed selection movement, and vigorous mass seed selection work must be carried out. All parts of the country should use methods such as comparing crops, comparing harvests, and field inspections to select improved crop varieties; and the selected improved varieties should be exchanged among farmers on the spot, and sent to the county seed selection committee for evaluation to select "preliminary selected seeds." Starting in 1951, the county promotion stations and village seed retention plots (fields specifically for propagating improved varieties) will propagate the county's "preliminary selected seeds" and existing superior varieties, as well as continue to select improved varieties. After this kind of propagation, superior varieties can be promoted to vast lands in 1952. In 1953, the provincial farms will compare and test the county's "preliminary selected seeds," select "final selected seeds," and send them to the special district propagation stations or county promotion stations for propagation, and continue to refine them once. In 1954, these carefully selected new varieties will be promoted to village seed retention plots for propagation. In 1955, this new seed can be universally promoted. In this way, improved varieties can be popularized throughout the country within five years.

　　争取五年之内良种普及全国
    中央人民政府农业部为推广优良品种，曾于今年四月初向各省发出“五年普及良种计划草案”，要求全国各地参照计划草案再根据当地条件，制定适合于各该地区的良种普及计划。由于目前农场繁殖的优良品种尚不够普遍推广之用，因此该计划草案规定以广泛开展群众性的宣传运动，为进行品种改良的基本工作。按照该计划草案的规定：一九五○年是选种运动奠定基础的一年，必须大力开展群众选种工作，全国各地应运用比庄稼、比收成、田间检查等方式选出作物良种；并将选出的良种一面组织农民群众就地互相交换，一面送县选种委员会评定，选出“初选种”。一九五一年起各县推广场和各村留种地（专为繁殖良种的田地），即将县的“初选种”和现有优良品种以及继续选出的良种进行繁殖。经过这种繁殖，一九五二年就可将优良品种推广到广大的土地上。一九五三年，各省农场将县“初选种”予以比较试验后，选出“决选种”，发到各专区繁殖场或县推广场进行繁殖，并继续精选一次。一九五四年就将这样精选的新的品种，推广到各村留种地繁殖。一九五五年这种新种就能普遍推广。这样，五年之内良种就可普及全国。
