Shanghai Cold Casting Factory Deputy Director Chi Jinlong
Shelters Embezzlement and Illegally Detains People

Chi Jinlong, the deputy director of the state-owned Shanghai Cold Casting Factory, detained the chairman of the labor union and sheltered corrupt former employees, causing serious errors of disorganization and lack of discipline.

Because of the embezzlement of former employees, the labor union chairman of the factory, Li Yongduo, reported to the East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department when the deputy director and director ignored the issue. Who knew that when the Industry Department sent people to investigate, Deputy Director Chi Jinlong falsely claimed that he was unaware of it? On May 18, he detained the labor union chairman Li Yongduo, ordering him to write a "confession" admitting the error of reporting to a higher level.

On the morning of the 19th, the labor union chairman again reported to the Industry Department by telephone and sent the labor union vice chairman to report the truth to the Hudong District Party Committee and the Hardware Labor Union. When the Hudong District Party Committee etc. went to investigate again, Chi Jinlong not only refused to admit his mistakes, but also opposed the comrades sent by the superior to investigate, saying, "Why make such a fuss!"

According to the investigation results of the East China Industry Department, in mid-April, the factory purchased a batch of scrap steel (about sixty or seventy tons), which was purchased by Hua Maoxing, a small contractor, in collusion with foreman Yang Shengde. The price was 9 million yuan per ton (the market price was 4.9 million to 7 million yuan). Yang received a bribe of 1.2 million yuan, and Zhou Jinsheng, a clerk in the purchasing department, received 500,000 yuan. After receiving the money, Zhou Jinsheng, fearing that other manufacturers would report him, reported to the factory director Xu Dexin (retained personnel). Xu replied, "There is no need to publicize it." On May 10, Zhou reported the facts to Deputy Director Chi Jinlong, who also did not reveal the case or report it to the higher authorities.

The main reason for this embezzlement was that Factory Director Xu Dexin indulged foreman Yang Shengde based on personal feelings and shielded Yang after the incident. Deputy Director Chi Jinlong, on the other hand, looked down on the masses. He had always held a contemptuous attitude towards labor union chairman Li Yongduo.

After investigation by the higher authorities, the factory held a mass meeting at 6:00 p.m. on June 6. The director and deputy director, as well as foreman Yang Shengde, clerk Zhou Jinsheng, etc., all confessed in public.

　　上海冷铸厂副厂长迟金龙
    包庇贪污非法扣人
    国营上海冷铸厂副厂长迟金龙，扣押工会主任，包庇旧职员贪污，造成无组织、无纪律的严重错误。
    该厂工会主任李永铎因旧职员贪污，正副厂长不闻不问，特向华东军政委员会工业部报告。谁知副厂长迟金龙在工业部派人前往调查时，伪称不知。并于五月十八日将工会主任李永铎扣押，命令他写“坦白书”，承认越级报告的错误。
    工会主任于十九日晨又用电话向工业部报告，并派工会副主任将实情报告沪东区党委及五金工会。当沪东区党委等再去调查时，迟金龙非但不承认错误，反对上级派去调查的同志说：“何必大惊小怪！”
    经华东区工业部调查结果，该厂于四月中旬买进废钢一批（约六七十吨），由小包工头华茂兴勾结领工杨盛德经手购买，每吨九十万元（市价四十九万到七十万），杨得贿赂款一百二十万元，购料科科员周金生得五十万元。周金生受款后，因怕其他厂商告发，曾报告厂长徐德新（留用人员），徐答以“不必声张”。至五月十日周又将事实报告副厂长迟金龙，迟亦不将案情揭露，也不向上级报告。
    造成这次贪污的原因，主要是厂长徐德新，从私人感情出发，纵容领工杨盛德，事发后又代杨包庇。副厂长迟金龙，则轻视群众。对工会主任李永铎则一向存在着轻视心理。
    经上级机关调查后，该厂于六月六日下午六时召开群众大会。正副厂长及领工杨盛德、科员周金生等均当众坦白。
