　　According to the Tianjin Daily, the Tianjin hardware and machinery industry has accepted an order of 2,500 tons from the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, overcoming the temporary difficulties of some factories and resuming production. The industry also established the Tianjin Private Machinery Industry Joint Manufacturing Plant on May 15th.

　　Since the spring of this year, due to sluggish sales of products, some medium-sized and small factories have been poorly managed and have successively fallen into a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown. In order to help solve the temporary difficulties of the industry and implement the policy of benefiting both public and private sectors, the Ministry of Heavy Industry allocated an order of 2,500 tons to the industry in early May, including 14,000 Liberation-style waterwheels, 300 sets of backboard signals, 34,600 sets of agricultural machinery such as seeders and disc harrows, four sets of power tools, and more than 200 various agricultural tools. The securing of this order not only maintained the industry's production for three or four months, but more importantly, made the capitalists of the industry further recognize the public-private benefit policy of the People's Government in supporting private industry and commerce. Now the industry's business confidence has been greatly enhanced, and under the leadership of the trade association, it has decided to establish the Tianjin Private Machinery Industry Joint Manufacturing Plant. Personnel and organization have been determined. In the future, unified purchasing and sales will be implemented, and attention will be paid to improving technology. As of now, 345 of the 450 private machinery factories in Tianjin have joined the Machinery Industry Joint Manufacturing Plant, and the factories that have not joined are also considering participating. According to the manager of the factory's management committee, in the past, when factories contracted national orders, there were often shortcomings such as non-compliance with specifications and failure to deliver goods on time. In the future, centralized management and improved technology can eliminate the above shortcomings. Due to the large number of national orders, everyone's business confidence has been enhanced. In order to strictly fulfill the contract provisions, the industry has also decided to jointly work with the Tianjin foundry industry and the blacksmithing industry to complete all orders before October 10th.

　　[Another Dispatch] The labor-capital collective contract that the hardware and machinery industry has been brewing for a long time has been formally signed by representatives of both labor and capital on the 26th of this month after being approved by the Tianjin Labor Bureau. A total of 52 factories participated in the signing of the contract, among which, except for a few factories manufacturing cotton gins, oil presses, match machines, and bicycle parts, which had temporary difficulties due to sluggish sales, most of the production conditions were extremely good. For example, Lianchang Machinery Factory and other factories have continuously accepted large orders, and Tianchang Machinery Factory has implemented preliminary democratic management, workers' production enthusiasm is high, and capitalists' business confidence has doubled.

　　中央重工业部订货二千五百吨
    津五金机器业恢复生产
    三百余厂组联合制造厂统一购销改进技术
    【本报讯】据天津日报消息：津市五金机器业，接受中央人民政府重工业部订货二千五百吨，克服了部分工厂的暂时困难，恢复了生产。该业并于五月十五日成立了津市私营机器工业联合制造厂。
    该业自今春以来，由于产品销路滞塞，一部分中、小工厂经营不善，便先后陷于停工或半停工状态。重工业部为帮助解决该业的暂时困难，贯彻公私兼顾方针，于五月初旬分配该业订货二千五百吨，其中包括解放式水车一万四千架，背板号志三百套，播种机和圆盘耙等农业机器三万四千六百套，电动工具四部及各种农业工具二百余台。这批订货订妥后，不仅维持了该业三、四个月的生产，更重要的是使该业各厂资方进一步认清了人民政府扶助私营工商业的公私兼顾政策。现该业经营信心已大大提高，在同业公会领导下，决定成立津市私营机器工业联合制造厂。并已确定人选和机构。今后将统一购销，注意改进技术。截至目前，津市私营机器业四百五十家工厂，已有三百四十五家加入了机器工业联合制造厂，未加入的厂家亦在酝酿参加。据该厂管理委员会经理表示：过去各厂承揽国家订货，往往有规格不合与不按期交货等缺点，今后集中经营，提高技术，当可以免除以上缺点。由于国家大量订货，使大家经营信心增强。该业为了严格履行合同规定，并决定联合津市铸铁业和打铁业共同在十月十日以前将全部订货做好。
    【又讯】五金机器业酝酿已久的劳资集体合同，经津市劳动局批准后，劳资双方代表已于本月二十六日正式签订。参加签订合同的工厂共五十二家，其中除制造轧花机、榨油机、火柴机、自行车零件等少数工厂，因销路不畅，曾经发生暂时困难外，大部分生产情况异常良好。如联昌机器厂等连续接受大批订货，天昌机器厂实行了初步民主管理，工人生产情绪高涨，资方经营信心倍增。
