Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: Speech by Hu Ming, Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The full text is as follows: Chairman, esteemed members, comrades:

　　After listening to Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the land reform issue, we express our complete support. We believe that Vice Chairman Liu's report and the draft of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China are entirely suitable for the conditions in the newly liberated areas of East China.

　　The basic situation in the rural areas of Jiangnan is no different from that in the rural areas of North China in the past. The landlord class cruelly exploited the peasants. Taking southern Anhui (皖南) (southern Anhui, before liberation, was a guerrilla zone) as an example, landlords occupied 50 to 60 percent of the land in the countryside, while poor peasants and farm laborers accounted for about 50 percent of the population, but owned less than 15 percent of the land. In addition to rent and usury, landlords also exploited peasants through rental deposits. On the peasant side, they worked hard all year round, and after paying rent and repaying debts in the autumn, they had very little left. Most peasants in southern Anhui could only afford to eat grain until the New Year, and some even became destitute and penniless after paying rent and repaying debts. This situation has changed somewhat since the rent reduction last year, and the lives of peasants have improved to some extent, but the fundamental problem has not been solved. Therefore, peasants in the newly liberated areas, like peasants in the old liberated areas in the past, have a very urgent need for land. The Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, which is to be passed this time, is entirely suitable for the conditions in the newly liberated areas and meets the demands of the vast number of peasant masses in the newly liberated areas.

　　We also express our full support for the issue of preserving the rich peasant economy in the Land Reform Law. As a result of generally not moving the land property of rich peasants, undoubtedly, poor peasants and farm laborers will get less land. However, this point should be explained to the poor peasants and farm laborers and can be explained to them. Vice Chairman Liu pointed out in his report: "Under the current situation, in the upcoming land reform, adopting a policy of protecting the rich peasant economy is both politically and economically necessary, and it is more beneficial to overcoming the current financial and economic difficulties and to our country and people." If we explain and persuade the poor peasants and farm laborers from their long-term and overall interests, this problem can be resolved. Moreover, there are considerations for special areas in the Land Reform Law, and the government will also provide assistance and care to peasants who receive less land.

　　Some people, due to the composition of peasant associations and the work style of cadres, doubt whether land reform can be carried out in the Jiangnan newly liberated areas this winter. Taking southern Anhui as an example, in the early days of liberation last year, the organization of some peasant associations was once impure. In these impure places, there were the most problems and deviations. The reason for this was that, on the one hand, the peasant masses had not been mobilized, and on the other hand, landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to infiltrate, and some even took the opportunity to organize peasant associations, so some peasant associations were simply landlord associations. This impure situation gradually improved with the development of mass movements such as bandit suppression, opposition to local bullies, rent reduction, and the implementation of reasonable burdens, and after the widespread convening of peasant representative conferences. There are still some impure situations at present, but this is not due to poor peasants and farm laborers acting as leaders. On the contrary, the reason why some places are still impure is precisely because the peasant masses have not been fully mobilized and the arrogance of the landlords is still rampant. In these places, landlords, rich peasants, and their agents still infiltrate various organizations. The landlord class not only takes all measures to resist in various movements, but also takes all measures to infiltrate peasant associations and other organizations. This is one of their important methods of resistance. Vice Chairman Liu pointed out: "Land reform is a systematic and fierce struggle." This is entirely correct. Therefore, to carry out land reform, we must first resolutely rely on the poor peasants and farm laborers, the peasant masses who are the most numerous, the most oppressed, and the most suffering in the countryside. Without this, not only can land reform not be carried out, but even movements such as opposing local bullies and reducing rent cannot be launched. Land reform requires correct policies and laws, but policies and laws must be combined with the masses to generate great power. Any detachment from the masses and failure to rely on the masses is destined to fail. The general line of land reform pointed out by Vice Chairman Liu is entirely correct and must be resolutely implemented.

　　Regarding cadres: In the southern Anhui area, a group of cadres came south from the old liberated areas of North China and Shandong. They have experience in land reform. Another group is cadres who persisted in guerrilla warfare, and this group of cadres has also been tested through struggle. In addition, a large number of new cadres have been added after liberation. Most of the above cadres are very good. They endure hardship and work tirelessly day and night, thereby achieving great results. On the other hand, shortcomings and deviations also exist. There were more in the early days of liberation, mainly because some cadres were unfamiliar with the situation at the beginning, and some lacked experience. In addition, the heavy and urgent tasks and the lack of time for education and training were also reasons. But these shortcomings can be completely corrected and are being corrected. Recently, training of land reform cadres has begun and rectification is underway.

　　Considering the above-mentioned mass conditions and cadre conditions, land reform can be carried out in the southern Anhui area this winter. We believe that with the above conditions and under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and by correctly implementing the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, it is possible to carry out land reform in an orderly manner this winter. Any excessive concern about the masses and cadres in the newly liberated areas and excessive emphasis on shortcomings and errors are unfounded.

### 人民政协全国委员会委员  胡明的发言

　　人民政协全国委员会委员
    胡明的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】人民政协全国委员会委员胡明在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言。全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    听了刘少奇副主席关于土地改革问题的报告后，我们表示完全拥护。我们认为刘副主席的报告与中华人民共和国土地改革法草案是完全适合于华东新区情况的。
    江南农村的基本情况，和过去北方农村的情况并没有什么不同，农村中同样是地主阶级残酷的剥削农民。就皖南（安徽南部，解放前是一个游击区）新区来说，农村中地主占有土地百分之五十到六十，贫农和雇农占人口约百分之五十，占有土地则不到百分之十五，地主对于农民除了地租和高利贷的剥削外，还有押租的剥削。在农民方面，他们终年辛苦劳动，一到秋后交了租还了债，就剩下无几。皖南大部分农民的粮食只能吃到过年，甚至有部分农民在交了租还了债以后就倾家荡产，一无所有了。这种情况在去年减租以后有了某些改变，农民生活得到某些改善，但根本问题并没有得到解决。所以新区农民和过去的老区农民一样，他们对于土地的要求是非常迫切的。这一次要通过的中华人民共和国土地改革法完全是适合于新区情况，适合于新区千千万万广大农民群众的要求的。
    对于土地改革法中保存富农经济的问题，我们也表示完全拥护。由于一般地不动富农土地财产的结果，无疑的贫雇农是会少得一些土地。但是对于贫雇农来说这一点是应当说服而且可以说服的。刘副主席在报告中指出：“在目前的形势下，在今后的土地改革中，采取保护富农经济的政策，不论在政治上经济上都是必要的，是比较的对于克服当前财政经济困难，对于我们的国家和人民为有利些。”对贫雇农从他们的长远利益及全面的利益上来加以解释和说服，这个问题是可以说服的。更何况在土改法上对特殊地区有照顾，政府对于少得土地的农民还会加以帮助和照顾。
    有些人就农会成份及干部作风问题怀疑到江南新区在今冬能否进行土改。就皖南区来说，去年解放初期，某些农民协会组织曾经一度表现不纯，就在这些不纯的地方，毛病和偏差最多，其原因一方面是农民群众尚未发动，另一方面地主富农乘机混进，甚至有乘机组织农会，因此有的农会简直就是地主会。这种不纯的情况，随着剿匪，反对恶霸，减租，贯彻合理负担等群众运动的开展，并普遍召开农民代表会议后，这些农会组织便逐渐走向健全。目前尚有部分不纯的情况，但这并不是由于贫雇农充当领导人的结果，恰恰相反，目前凡属不纯的地方，正是农民群众还未充分发动，地主气焰还在嚣张的地方。这些地方地主富农及其代理人，仍然混进各种组织，地主阶级不但在各种运动中采取一切办法来进行抵抗，而且用一切办法混进农会及其他组织。这正是他们进行反抗的一种重要方法之一。刘副主席指出：“土地改革是一场系统的激烈的斗争”。这是完全正确的。所以土地改革的进行，首先必须坚决依靠贫雇农发动这一部分在农村中人口最多最受压迫最受痛苦的农民群众，不如此，不但土地改革无法进行，就是连反对恶霸和减租等运动也会发动不起来。土地改革中需要有正确的政策和法令，但政策法令必须和群众结合才能发生伟大的力量，任何脱离群众、不依靠群众，注定是要失败的。刘副主席指出的土改总路线是完全正确的，必须坚决贯彻执行。
    干部方面：皖南区的干部有一批是从华北和山东老区南下的干部，他们有土改的经验；另外一批是坚持游击战争的干部，这批干部也是经过斗争考验的。此外，解放后增加了大批新的干部。上述这些干部绝大部分都是很好的。他们吃苦耐劳，日以继夜，不疲倦地进行工作，从而获得很大的成绩。另一方面缺点和偏差也是存在的。解放初期较多，主要原因是由于有的干部开始时情况生疏，有的缺乏经验，此外由于任务繁重而紧迫，来不及教育训练也是原因之一。但这些缺点是完全可以纠正，而且正在纠正之中，最近已经开始进行土改干部的训练并进行整风。
    综合上述群众条件和干部条件，皖南区在今年冬季是可以进行土改的，我们相信有了上述条件，并在毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导下，正确执行中华人民共和国土地改革法，是可以做到有秩序地进行今冬的土地改革，任何对于新区群众干部问题过分顾虑和过分强调缺点与错误，是没有根据的。
