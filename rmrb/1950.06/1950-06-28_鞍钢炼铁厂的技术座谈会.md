　　Technical Symposium at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Wen Liangxian
　　Since the second half of last year, technical personnel at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Ironworks have organized a technical research association, which was later formalized into a weekly technical symposium. Over the past six months, this symposium has played a certain role in improving technology, exchanging experiences, and increasing production and quality, while also creating some valuable experience.

　　I. Discussion Methods Should Implement the Principle of Combining Theory and Practice.

　　The issues discussed at the symposium are all based on existing practical problems. For example, when hanging or bridging occurred in the blast furnace in the past, the technicians prepared records of the circumstances when hanging or bridging occurred. They then analyzed the raw material situation, the operating situation, and the batching situation to understand the causes of hanging or bridging and to determine the steps and methods for dealing with it. Through such detailed research, the conclusions drawn from the summation of experience were elevated to theory, becoming a guiding direction for operation.

　　II. Implement the Spirit of Self-Criticism, Encourage Debate, and Prevent Bias.

　　Because the participants in the research had different educational backgrounds and worked in different locations, their operational experiences also differed, leading to inconsistencies in their views and handling of problems. Therefore, it was necessary to engage in debate. For example, there were some disputes in the past regarding the slag ratio in steelmaking, and what kind of basicity was required for making certain types of steel. Some advocated acidity, some advocated alkalinity, and some advocated neutrality or near-basicity. For this reason, it was necessary to engage in criticism and prevent bias. At the same time, for some issues that could not be uniformly resolved in the meeting, practical operation was used to gain experience, and finally a more practical unified method and opinion were obtained.

　　III. Discuss and Determine Production Quotas Through Technical Symposiums.

　　Whether the blast furnace production can complete its task depends not only on the close cooperation of various departments and the efforts of the workers, but also on the technical operations of the blast furnace technicians. The technicians of each furnace are very concerned about whether the production tasks of their furnaces are reasonable and whether the allocation of raw materials is good. If handled improperly, it will affect their operational morale. Therefore, the factory takes the quota and batching plan to the technical symposium for research every month. The technicians are very serious in the discussion and argue fiercely. But after the quota and batching plan are decided, everyone works hard to implement it. In the past two months, blast furnace production has been very good, and a new atmosphere of activity and tension has emerged in the work.

　　IV. The Technical Symposium is a Good Way for Leaders to Learn from the Masses and for Technical Personnel to Learn from Each Other.

　　Most of the leading comrades in the technical symposium can carefully listen to the various opinions of the technical personnel, so they can get more specific knowledge. At the same time, the technical symposium can make everyone understand the problem more comprehensively, so that some scattered opinions can be integrated into more comprehensive and mature opinions. For the technical personnel themselves, this is also a good form of collective research and mutual learning.

　　鞍钢炼铁厂的技术座谈会
    本报特约通讯员  温良贤
    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂技术人员，从去年下半年便组织了技术研究会，后来又将它确定为每周举行的技术座谈会。半年来，这种座谈会对于改进技术，交流经验，提高产量质量都起了一定的作用，同时创造了一些经验。
  一、讨论方法要贯彻理论和实际相结合的原则。
    座谈会所讨论的问题均是从实际所存在的问题出发。比如过去高炉发生棚吊，事先由技术员准备发生棚吊时的记录材料，从实际的材料中了解原料情况，操作情况，配料情况，然后加以分析，了解棚吊的成因，确定处理的步骤和方法。经过这样细密的研究，由经验的总结上升到理论，得出的结论便成为操作上的指导方向。
  二、贯彻自我批评的精神，展开争论，防止偏向。
    由于参加研究的人员中过去所学的不同，工作地点不同，所得的操作经验也有所不同，以致对于问题的看法与处理并不一致，为此，需要展开争论。比如在作制钢铁的渣比上，对于制那种钢铁需要什么样的盐基度，过去是有些争论的，有主张带酸性的，有主张带碱性的，有主张中性的、近盐基性的，为此需要展开批评，防止偏向。同时对于一些不能在会议上作出统一的规定的问题，便从实际操作上去体验，终于求得了更切实际的统一的办法和意见。
  三、通过技术座谈会讨论和确定生产定额。
    高炉生产的能否完成任务，除各部门密切配合与工人的努力操作互相保证外，还取决于高炉上的技术人员的技术操作。各炉的技术人员对于本炉的生产任务订得合理不合理，原料的配备好不好都很关心。如果处理的不适当，便会影响他们操作的情绪。因此该厂每月都将定额与配料计划拿到技术座谈会去研究。技术人员在讨论时是非常认真的，而且争论得很厉害。但定额与配料计划决定以后，大家便努力执行。最近两个月高炉生产很好，工作中呈现了活跃紧张的新气象。
  四、技术座谈会是领导向群众学习与技术人员互相学习的好形式。
    大部分领导同志在技术座谈会中，都能细心的听取技术人员的各种意见，因而可以得到更多具体的智识。同时在技术座谈会上可以使大家了解问题更全面，使一些零细的意见综合成为比较全面的成熟的意见。对于技术人员本身来讲，这也是一种集体研究、互相学习的好形式。
