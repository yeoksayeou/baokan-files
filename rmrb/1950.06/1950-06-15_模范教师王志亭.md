　　Model Teacher Wang Zhting

　　Wang Zhting, a model teacher from Jingxing County, Hebei Province, is a native of Dishui'an Village in the county and is thirty-four years old this year. He came from a poor family and had no formal education, only attending night school for three winter sessions.

　　In 1949, the village began to establish an elementary school. He took on the role of teacher. Due to his active and practical work, he ran the school very well. Therefore, during the spring vacation awards in 1948, he was rated as one of the three model teachers in the county. This encouraged his interest and confidence in education. In the same year, he was transferred to Houting Village, a neighboring village, to serve as a teacher, but he encountered difficulties. The village cadres and masses of Houting Village knew that he had not attended a formal school and were afraid that he would not teach well, so they wanted to ask the higher authorities to transfer him away. This gave him a great stimulus, making him deeply feel that if he did not work hard to study and improve himself, and run the school well, he would not be supported by the masses. Therefore, he worked hard to study and delve into the textbooks. In May 1949, he was transferred to the county teacher training class for study. He was extremely happy. During the three-month study period in the training class, he worked hard to study and concentrated on learning arithmetic.

　　In August 1949, he was sent to Dongjianshan Village, seven miles away from Houting Village, to serve as a teacher. The cadres and masses of the village also looked down on him and did not care about the school. The school lacked desks, chairs, and supplies. He discussed this with the village cadres. Education Committee member Ma Deshuang said, "You take care of it!" But Comrade Wang Zhting did not lose heart. He thought, "I'm not afraid of your contempt, I am determined to run the school well."

　　At that time, it was the autumn grain collection season, and the village had challenged other villages to complete the grain collection work early. However, the village lacked people who could calculate accounts, and the masses were waiting to hand in grain but could not calculate the accounts. The village cadres and masses were very anxious. He immediately helped with the calculations, which led to the successful completion of the grain collection work. From then on, the village cadres and masses did not look down on him as much as before. Everyone said, "Our Lao Wang is capable!" He also discussed the issue of school opening with the village cadres. With the help of the village cadres, they held a parents' meeting. He sincerely said to the parents, "As long as you send your children to school, I guarantee I will teach them well!" Some parents then sent their children to the school.

　　After the school opened, Wang Zhting was determined to teach the students well. Before lecturing, he fully prepared his lessons. Outside of class, he often spent time with the students, telling them stories and jokes, making the students willing to approach him. In this way, he gained the support of all the students. The students all said to their parents, "Teacher Wang is pretty good, his lectures are even better than Teacher Li (the previous teacher), and he often tells us stories." As a result, his prestige increased. No one in the village looked down on him anymore.

　　Comrade Wang Zhting also adopted many new teaching methods. He organized lower grade students into groups to learn characters, allowing them to study collectively and check each other during extracurricular time. When teaching older students, he paid attention to connecting learning with practice. Once, the school bought coal, and he told the students the weight of the coal and the price per unit, asking everyone to calculate. In this way, students could apply what they learned, and their interest in learning increased.

　　In addition, he adopted individualized education methods for children from poor families who often asked for leave. For example, Ma Deshuang's child, Ma Niuxiao (sixteen years old), often missed class because the family needed him to work. Wang Zhting tutored him in his spare time.

　　Due to Comrade Wang Zhting's active efforts, the number of students gradually increased. Of the thirty-two school-age children in the village, twenty-nine have enrolled. The masses in the village are now concerned about the school. Last winter, the masses discussed and decided to repair the existing desks and benches and added eleven more desks. This spring, they whitewashed the classroom walls and opened windows, making the school look brand new. Some people told him their heartfelt feelings: "Lao Wang! When you first came, we looked down on you. We didn't expect you to teach the children in our village so well!"

　　At the county-wide teacher awards conference this June, he was rated as a first-class model teacher.

　　模范教师王志亭
    河北省井陉县模范教师王志亭，该县滴水岸人，今年三十四岁。他出身贫苦，没有上过学，只在夜校里念过三冬书。
    一九四九年，该村开始设立小学。他担任了教员。由于他积极实干，把学校办得很好。因此，在一九四八年春假进行评奖时，他被评为全县三个模范教师之一。这鼓舞了他对教育事业的兴趣与信心。同年他被调到邻近的后亭村任教员，却碰到了钉子。后亭村的村干部和群众都知道他没有上过正式的学校，怕他教不好书，想要求上级将他调走。这给了他一个极大的刺激，使他深深感到：如不努力学习，提高自己，将学校办好，是不会受到群众拥护的。因此，他便努力学习，钻研课本。一九四九年五月，他被调到县教员轮训班去学习。他高兴极了。在轮训班三个多月的学习时间中，他努力钻研，专心学习算术。
    一九四九年八月他被派到与后亭村相距七里路的东尖山村任教。该村的干部和群众也都瞧不起他，对学校也不关心。学校里的桌椅用具都很困难，要啥没啥。他就和村干部去商量。教育委员马德双说：“你瞧着办吧！”但王志亭同志毫不灰心。他想：“不怕你们轻视，我有决心把学校办好。”
    当时正在秋征，该村与别村挑了战，要提早完成征粮工作。可是村里会算账的人很缺，群众老等着交粮，就是算不出账来。村干部与群众都很着急。他便立即帮着算账，使征粮工作胜利完成。从这以后，村干部和群众就不像以前那末瞧不起他了。大家都说：“咱们老王有两下子！”他又和村干部研究开学问题。在村干部的帮助下，他们召开了家长会。他诚恳地向家长们说：“只要你们把儿童送到学校里，我就保证把他们教好！”一部分家长便把孩子送到学校里来了。
    开学后，王志亭就决心教好学生。在讲课前，他就充分地准备功课。在课外，他又经常与同学们在一起，给他们讲故事、说笑话，使同学们都乐意接近他。这样，他就得到了全体同学的拥护。同学们都对家长说：“王老师可不错哩，讲课比李老师（前任教员）讲得还好，平时又常给俺们讲故事。”这样一来，他的威信提高了。全村再没人瞧不起他了。
    王志亭同志还采用了许多新的教学方法。他把低年级学生编成小组学生字，让他们在课外时间也能集体学习，互相检查。他教高年级学生时，便注意使学习联系实际。有一次学校里买了炭，他便把炭的斤数和每斤多少钱告诉同学，要大家来算。这样学生们学了就能应用，学习的兴趣也就高了。
    此外，他对于家庭生活贫苦、经常请假的儿童，采取了个别教育的办法。如马德双的孩子马牛小（十六岁），因为家中要他干活，便常常误课。王志亭便在课余时间为他补课。
    由于王志亭同志的积极努力，学生便逐渐增多。全村三十二个学龄儿童，已有二十九个上了学。全村群众对学校都关心起来。去年冬天群众自议，除修理了旧有的桌凳外，又增加了书桌十一张；今春又用白粉刷了课堂的墙壁，另开了窗户，使学校焕然一新。有些老百姓对他说出了知心话：“老王！你刚来时，俺们可是看不起你。可想不到你能把俺村儿童教得这么好！”
    在今年六月全县教员评奖大会上，他被评为甲等模范教师了。
