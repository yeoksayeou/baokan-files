　　Guanghua Holds Ball Games to Relieve Unemployed Workers
　　To relieve unemployed workers in Shanghai, Guanghua Girls' High School held a sports performance meeting on May 27th. The meeting included apparatus exercises performed by the school's skills team and the Beijing Skills Joint Team, as well as basketball games between the Normal University Men's Red Team and the Weiming Basketball Team, and the Normal University Women's Red Team and the Beiman Girls' High School Basketball Team. All proceeds, totaling 900,000 yuan, have been handed over to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for transfer to unemployed workers in Shanghai.
　　In addition, the school's current affairs quizzes have sparked students' interest in reading newspapers. Since April, the school has held a school-wide current affairs quiz every two weeks. This has greatly helped students understand current affairs. Some students said: "In the past, I couldn't get a handle on the newspaper and couldn't understand it. Now, reading the newspaper has become a necessity." (Guanghua Girls' High School Student Union Correspondence Group)
　　Hebei High School Visits Factories
　　The Hebei High School Education Department, in order to enhance students' practical knowledge, has led students of various grades to visit eight places, including factories, schools, and prisons, since mid-April. First-year students visited Peking University Medical College and the People's Court Prison; second-year students visited Peking University Chemistry Department, Xinhua Rubber Factory, and Peking University Geology Department; third-year students visited the Tram Company Repair Factory, Feima Brewery, Beijing Branch of North China Paper Company, and North China Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Factory. Each visit was warmly guided by the staff of the relevant institutions and factories. The students all believe that these visits are very helpful for learning. The school will continue to conduct such visits in the future. (Hebei High School Correspondence Group)
　　Xinhua Middle School Inspects Learning
　　The Xinhua Middle School Education Department, in order to understand students' learning situation, convened some students for a chat on May 20th and found that some students' past reviews were not thorough enough and their learning was not solid enough. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the Education Department has strengthened guidance on students' self-study and held temporary examinations. In addition, it combines mutual aid groups to check learning results every week, and holds criticism and self-criticism every two weeks, with students who are active in learning urging and leading lagging students to study. Since its implementation, it has achieved great results.

Now, each person only needs to pay 50 jin of millet for food each month. Steamed buns are available for half a month each month, and there are plenty of vegetables.
