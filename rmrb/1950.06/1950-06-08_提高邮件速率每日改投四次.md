    To improve the speed of mail delivery, the Beijing Postal Administration has decided to increase the number of daily deliveries for ordinary and registered mail from three to four times (and express mail six times) starting on Monday, June 5th.
    [Another News Item] Regarding the "bulk posting and bulk payment" method for large quantities of mail sent by various government agencies, organizations, newspapers, and bookstores, some agencies and organizations have reported that it is still troublesome to pay postage each time they send mail. The Beijing Postal Administration has now obtained approval from the General Post Office to allow senders to prepay an amount equivalent to one month's postage as a deposit, which will be settled at the end of the month or every half month. Units requiring this service may contact the Business Section of the former Beijing Postal Administration.

    提高邮件速率每日改投四次
    北京邮政管理局为提高邮件投递速率，决定自六月五（星期一）日起将平日普通邮件与挂号邮件投递次数，由三次增为四次（快信投递六次）。
    【又讯】各机关、团体、报社、书局交寄的大批邮件，邮局原定有“整寄整付”办法，有些机关团体反映，每交一次付一次邮资仍感麻烦。兹经北京邮政管理局呈准邮政总局，可由寄件人预交相当于一个月邮费的预存金，至月终或半月结算一次。各单位如需要时，可至前内北京邮管局营业科洽办。
