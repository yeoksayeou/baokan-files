　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Compiled from TASS dispatches: The Fifth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe opened in Geneva on May 31. Attending the meeting were Soviet representative Yaruzhan, American representative Harriman, British representative Davies, and representatives from other European countries.

　　At the meeting on June 2, Swedish representative Karlin Kirk and Czechoslovak representative Tauber were elected as the chairman and vice-chairman of the meeting, respectively.

　　Soviet representative Yaruzhan spoke at the meeting on the 2nd. He criticized the Economic Commission for Europe and its affiliated committees for failing to complete their tasks. He pointed out that Western European countries are currently encountering serious market problems, which are the result of the forced massive import of American goods into Western Europe under the Marshall Plan, and the United States' oppression of several Western European countries in adopting discriminatory policies towards trade with Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union. Yaruzhan listed the reduction of production and the increasing severity of unemployment in Western European Marshallized countries.

　　Yaruzhan, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, proposed: (1) to instruct the Commission's Foreign Trade Committee to formulate proposals for the development of trade between European countries, especially between Eastern and Western European countries; (2) to instruct the Executive Secretary of the Commission to submit a report on the economic deterioration of European countries under the Marshall Plan for reference by the Foreign Trade Committee; (3) to instruct the Executive Secretary of the Commission to formulate measures to reduce unemployment and improve the lives of workers, to be submitted to the Commission's Labor Committee for discussion; (4) to instruct the Executive Secretary of the Commission to submit a report to the Commission's Agricultural Committee on assisting small and medium farmers.

　　In his speech, Yaruzhan also stated that the Soviet Union supports the proposal by the Commission's Executive Secretary, Myrdal, to conclude a European grain agreement. This proposal is conducive to the development of trade between Eastern and Western Europe. If Western European countries can withstand the pressure from the United States, the Soviet Union can participate in discussions on concluding this agreement at an appropriate time.

　　Note: The Commission's Executive Secretary, Myrdal, visited the capitals of various European countries before the meeting. During his stay in Moscow from May 7 to 16, he met with the heads of the Soviet government. According to Agence France-Presse, Myrdal's purpose in this trip was to discuss the issue of restoring trade between Eastern and Western Europe with the governments of various European countries. Prior to the opening of this session of the Economic Commission for Europe, Myrdal had put forward a proposal to conclude a European grain agreement for discussion at the meeting.

　　联合国欧洲经济委员会开会
    苏建议发展东西欧贸易 
    并斥马歇尔计划使西欧经济恶化
    【新华社九日讯】综合塔斯社消息：联合国欧洲经济委员会第五次会议，已于五月三十一日在日内瓦开幕。出席会议的有苏联代表亚鲁疆、美国代表哈里曼、英国代表戴维斯以及其他欧洲国家的代表。
    六月二日的会议上，瑞典代表卡林·柯克和捷克斯洛伐克代表塔乌贝尔分别当选为该会的主席与副主席。
    苏联代表亚鲁疆于二日在会上发言。他批评了欧洲经济委员会及其所属委员会未能完成它们的任务。他指出：目前，西欧国家遭遇严重的市场问题，这是由于马歇尔计划下美国货物强制大量输入西欧，以及美国压迫若干西欧国家对于东欧各国和苏联的贸易采取歧视政策的结果。亚鲁疆列举了西欧马歇尔化国家生产缩减、失业日趋严重的情况。
    亚鲁疆代表苏联代表团建议：（１）责成该会所属对外贸易委员会拟订发展欧洲各国间，尤其是东西欧国家间的贸易的建议；（２）责成该会执行秘书就欧洲国家在马歇尔计划下经济恶化的情况，提出一个报告，以供对外贸易委员会参考；（３）责成该会执行秘书拟出一个减少失业、改善工人生活的办法，交该会所属劳工委员会讨论；（４）责成该会执行秘书向该会所属农业委员会提出一个援助小农及中农的报告。
    亚鲁疆在发言中并表示：苏联赞成该会执行秘书密达尔所提出的缔结欧洲谷物协定的建议。这一建议有助于发展东西欧之间的贸易。假如西欧国家能够抵挡得住美国的压力，苏联在适当时候可以参加缔结这一协定的讨论。
    按：该会执行秘书密达尔曾于会前访问欧洲各国的首都。在其于五月七日至十六日逗留莫斯科期间，曾与苏联政府首长会谈。据法新社消息：密达尔此行的目的，是与欧洲各国政府商谈恢复东西欧之间贸易的问题。此次欧洲经济委员会开会前，密达尔曾提出了一个缔结欧洲谷物协定的建议，供会议讨论。
