　　Beijing Branch of the China Department Store
    Adjusts Prices to Accommodate Private Businesses
    And Supports Factory Production Through Exchanges, Acquisitions, and Commissioned Sales of Finished Products

    [News from Our Newspaper] Following the instructions of the Ministry of Trade, the Beijing Branch of the China Department Store adjusted its wholesale and retail prices starting June 7th. The increase in retail prices ensures legitimate profits for private businesses. The company also helps factories and workshops resolve current production difficulties by establishing production exchange contracts, acquisitions, and commissioned sales of finished products.

    After the company increased retail prices, a certain distance was maintained between wholesale and retail prices. For example, the prices on June 7th were: Taiwan 3-5 brand sugar, wholesale price 5,200 yuan per jin, retail price 5,800 yuan; Smart socks, wholesale 87,000 yuan per dozen, retail 8,000 yuan per pair; Qingzhi Long toothpaste, wholesale 28,600 yuan per dozen, retail 2,600 yuan per tube, etc. In order to further establish business relationships with private merchants, the company's wholesale department sent cadres to contact various retail stores and solicit opinions. Recently, they have further simplified purchasing procedures and helped purchasing merchants handle transportation tax certificates and other procedures. As of the 20th, 117 merchants had established business relationships with the company.

    In terms of helping factories, workshops, and family handicraft producers overcome current production difficulties, the company not only purchases finished products but also establishes production exchange contracts with knitting industries (towels, socks) that have better production equipment and superior products, exchanging raw materials for finished products. Currently, ten sock factories and eighteen towel factories have signed contracts with the company, exchanging more than 300 dozen socks and towels each day. In order to improve the quality of each factory's products and open up sales channels, the company specially transported dyed electric yarn from Tianjin for the factories to use in production and created the new "Unity Brand" towel. Regarding the acquisition of finished products, the company has been continuously acquiring matches from Danhua and Houchang factories, Pianyan paper from Yanjing and Dongfang factories, and products from other factories of all sizes. As of now, the total amount of acquisitions and exchanges has reached 10.5 billion yuan. The company also helps factories promote finished products through consignment sales. Currently, 130 manufacturers have established consignment sales relationships with the company, with daily consignment sales reaching 20 million yuan. Consignment sales payments are settled and withdrawn the next day, and remittances are made on behalf of companies from other regions.

    在帮助工厂、作坊、家庭手工业者度过目前生产困难方面，该公司除收购成品外，并与生产设备较好、产品较佳的针织业（毛巾、袜子）订立生产交换合约，以原料交换成品。现已有织袜厂十家，织毛巾厂十八家与该公司订立了合约，每日交换袜子、毛巾各三百余打。该公司为提高各厂产品质量，以打开销路，特由天津运来染制电光纱供各厂生产；并新创“团结牌”毛巾。收购成品方面，最近对丹华、厚生厂之火柴，燕京、东方厂之片艳纸及其他大小厂之产品均不断收购。截至目前止，收购及交换之总额已达一百零五亿元。该公司复以代售方式，帮助各厂推销成品，现已与该公司建立代售业务的有一百三十余厂家，每日代售货款达二千万元，当日代售货款均于次日算清取款，外埠则代为汇寄。
