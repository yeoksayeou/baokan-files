　　All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Issues Statement
    Protesting US Government Persecution of Progressive Writers
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles issued a statement strongly protesting the US government's sentencing of Hollywood progressive writers Lawson and Trumbo to prison for so-called contempt of the House Un-American Activities Committee. The statement said: The shameful and dark verdict of the reactionary American government against the two progressive writers, Lawson and Trumbo, is another proof of the Truman reactionary government's destruction of democracy and suppression of culture. This act not only directly infringes upon the freedom rights of the American people, but also poses a serious threat to peace-loving people around the world. People all over the world will fully support the just stand of the two progressive writers, Lawson and Trumbo.

　　我全国文联发表声明
    抗议美政府迫害进步作家
    【新华社二十日讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会发表声明，严重抗议美国政府对好莱坞进步作家劳森和特鲁波因所谓蔑视众院非美活动委员会而判处徒刑。声明称：美国反动政府对于劳森和特鲁波两位进步作家的无耻而黑暗的判决，正是杜鲁门反动政府摧残民主，压迫文化的又一次证明。这一行为，不但直接侵犯了美国人民的自由权利，而且对于世界爱好和平的人民是一种严重的威胁。全世界人民将以全力支持劳森和特鲁波两位进步作家的正义立场。
