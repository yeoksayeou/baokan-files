Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st. In the two months of general survey work of grain warehouses in Shanxi Province, a serious phenomenon of massive grain loss was discovered. According to preliminary statistics from early May alone, the total amount of new and old grain lost throughout the province due to mildew, spoilage, germination, insect infestation, embezzlement, theft, illegal misappropriation, warehouse collapses, etc., reached more than 1,138,000 jin. The most serious loss was mildew and spoilage, amounting to more than 710,000 jin.

The reasons for the losses, in addition to poor natural and material conditions of the warehouses and insufficient experience of the cadres, are mainly: First, the bureaucratic work style of many local governments in managing state property. In September of last year, although the Shanxi Provincial People's Government had instructed all localities to immediately carry out inventory and handover while establishing grain warehouse institutions, the special districts and counties did not pay attention. Some county governments simply ignored the instructions, claiming to be "too busy to take care of it." Many leading bodies had arrangements for work but no inspection, failing to discover problems, or failing to solve problems in a timely manner when they were discovered. The Provincial Grain Bureau did not know the exact amount of grain currently available in the province; the district and branch warehouses did not know the amount of grain in their respective special districts and counties. Due to the bureaucratic style of the leading bodies, coupled with insufficient education for the cadres, some working cadres developed corrupt practices. Zhu Junxiu, the administrator of the Yongyu Fourth Branch Warehouse, privately used more than 16,000 jin of public grain in two years, and the amount of grain stored in the warehouse accounts was about 100,000 jin less than the amount stored in the county finance section accounts. The county leadership did not pay attention to or promptly inspect this matter. The incident of Wen Xugang, secretary of the Linjin County Government, and Xing Tai, the former county magistrate, privately borrowing more than 13,700 jin of public grain has not yet been thoroughly dealt with. According to preliminary statistics for the province, the total amount of public grain illegally misappropriated and embezzled reached more than 138,200 jin.

Second, some warehouse cadres are extremely irresponsible towards state property, resulting in a large number of grain thefts. In Yuncheng Special District alone, there have been a total of eleven thefts from November last year to the present, and in Changzhi, there have been nine theft cases from January to April. A total of more than 55,200 jin of public grain has been stolen throughout the province. The reason is, first of all, the widespread and serious phenomenon of cadres leaving their posts without permission. The cadres of the Wenxi Dongyao Warehouse went home for a month without returning to work, resulting in the theft of more than 20,000 jin of public grain. Among the thirteen cadres of the Yishi Branch Warehouse, ten focused on taking care of their families as their main priority and their work as secondary, resulting in the occurrence of theft incidents in four of the six branch warehouses in the county. For example, the Xiangle Warehouse stored a total of 40,670 jin of grain, of which more than 19,000 jin were stolen by the reactionary landlord Yan Dayong. Secondly, grain cadres do not pay attention to storage work. Some people think: "So much grain, it doesn't matter if three or two thousand jin are spoiled!" When summarizing warehouse storage work at the provincial district and branch warehouse director meeting in late March, it was emphasized that mildew was due to objective reasons such as climate, moisture, temperature, and poor equipment, and it was not recognized that irresponsibility was the main reason for the losses.

In contrast to the above situation, the Qingyuan and Jinyuan counties in the Fenyang Special District did not suffer any grain losses due to the active responsibility of the warehouse cadres. In particular, Zhang Wuliang of the Qingyuan Warehouse personally inspected with the warehouse keepers every ten days and also adhered well to various systems. However, this exemplary action of actively taking responsibility for state property did not receive the praise it deserved. In the past, the unclear rewards and punishments of the leading bodies undoubtedly contributed to the development of irresponsible and bad work styles among the cadres.

The above situation has been improved after two months of inventory work. Various localities have generally carried out turning over, drying, reversing warehouses, and loosening warehouses, temporarily preventing the development of mildew and insect infestation. At the same time, warehouse protection work has also been strengthened. All seven special districts in the province have begun to establish warehouse protection committees, among which the public security departments in Changzhi, Yuncheng, and Yuci have dispatched public security forces specifically responsible for protecting warehouses. Embezzlement, illegal misappropriation and other cases will be dealt with severely in various localities.

### 地方干部官僚主义  保管干部不负责任  山西各地存粮损耗严重  经过两月普查情况已有改进

　　地方干部官僚主义
    保管干部不负责任
    山西各地存粮损耗严重
    经过两月普查情况已有改进
    【新华社太原一日电】山西省在两个月来的普查粮食仓库工作中，发现大量粮食遭受损耗的严重现象。仅据五月上旬初步统计，全省新旧粮食因霉烂、变味、生芽、生虫以及贪污、失盗、非法挪用、塌库等损失的粮食共达一百一十三万八千余斤。损失中最严重的是霉烂、变味，计达七十一万余斤。
    造成损失的原因，除仓库自然条件与物质条件差，干部经验不足等外，主要是：第一，不少地方政府在管理国家财富工作中的官僚主义作风。去年九月，山西省人民政府虽已指示各地在建立粮食仓库机构的同时，立即进行清理移交，但各专区及各县均未重视。有些县政府，接到指示后，竟置之不理。不少县政府推说“事情忙、顾不过来”。许多领导机关对工作有布置，没检查，不能发现问题，或者发现了问题却没有及时解决。省粮食局不知道全省现有粮食的确实数量；各区、分库也不知道自己所辖专、县粮食数量。由于领导机关的官僚主义作风，加上对干部的教育不够，某些工作干部滋长了贪污腐化的行为。永虞四支库管理员朱君秀，二年内私用公粮一万六千余斤，仓库账存粮数少于县财政科账存约十万余斤。该县领导机关对此事竟未加以注意与及时检查。临晋县政府秘书温旭岗和前任县长邢钛，私借公粮一万三千七百余斤的事件，到现在还没有彻底处理。据全省初步统计，非法挪用及贪污公粮，共达十三万八千二百余斤。
    第二，有些仓库干部对国家财富极不负责，以致发生大量粮食被盗的事件。仅运城专区去年十一月至现在即一共发生偷盗十一次，长治从一月到四月发生失盗案九件。全省失盗公粮共计五万五千二百余斤。其原因首先是干部擅离职守的现象普遍而严重。闻喜东窑库干部回家经月不返职工作，使公粮被盗二万余斤。猗氏分库十三个干部中有十人以顾家为主，工作为副，致使全县六个支库中有四个支库发生了失盗事件。如香乐仓库共存有粮食四万零六百七十斤，被反动地主阎大勇窃去一万九千余斤。其次是粮食干部对保管工作的不重视，有人认为：“这么多粮食，坏三、两千斤不要紧！”三月下旬全省区、分库主任会议上总结仓库保管工作时，强调霉烂是由于气候、水分、温度以及设备不好等客观原因，没有认识到不负责任是造成损失的主要原因。
    与上述情况相反的是：汾阳专区清源、晋源等县，由于仓库干部的积极负责，粮食未受损失。特别是清源仓库张悟良，每隔十日即协同保管员亲自检查，同时很好地坚持了各项制度。但这种对国家财富积极负责的模范行动，竟未获得应有表扬。过去领导机关对干部的赏罚不明，无疑地是促成了干部不负责的恶劣作风的发展。
    上述情况，经过两月来的清查工作以后，已有所改进。各地已普遍进行了翻晒、倒库、松库，暂时防止了霉烂、生虫等现象的发展。同时，护仓工作亦已加强。全省七个专区均开始成立了护仓委员会，其中长治、运城、榆次等地公安部门已派出公安部队专责保护仓库。对贪污、非法挪用等案件，各地将从严处理。
