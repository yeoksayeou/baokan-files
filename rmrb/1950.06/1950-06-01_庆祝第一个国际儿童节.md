　　Celebrating the First International Children's Day
    Liu Shi
    June 1st this year is the first International Children's Day. Our Central People's Government has announced that June 1st International Children's Day will be China's own children's holiday. In order to prepare for the celebration of the June 1st International Children's Day and respond to the "Appeal to Defend Children's Rights and Strive for Peace" issued by the International Democratic Women's Federation and other groups, eleven people's organizations and relevant children's work departments of the Central People's Government in our country have organized a grand preparatory committee and carried out the necessary preparatory work; and called on all sectors of society and parents across the country who care about children's happiness to prepare to review our children's work on this day throughout the country, promote the cause of defending children's rights, and establish a happy life for our children. For the safety of children all over the world, we should join hands with parents from all countries and all those who care about children's happiness to oppose imperialist war conspiracies and strive for lasting world peace. The people of New China have accepted this international righteous call, and at the same time will take the cause of defending children's rights as their own international responsibility.
    June 1st will be a grand international holiday. Today, it is also an international day of battle. The light of human justice will be developed in this noble struggle to defend children's rights. Parents from all countries in the world will unite on this common basis of loving their own children, raise their political consciousness, increase their vigilance, and strive for lasting peace. Children all over the world will, on this international holiday, enhance their friendship with each other, cultivate the spirit of internationalism, promote greater brotherly love in this great international family, and jointly build their own happy new life.
    June 1st will also be a true holiday for Chinese children themselves. In old China, only a few children had an unhealthy Children's Day based on narrow self-interest. People's China has only now had a national children's holiday for the first time. The state has for the first time shown concern for mothers across the country and the children of the working people, and has included "promoting health and medical undertakings, paying attention to protecting the health of mothers, infants and children" and "popularizing education" in the "Common Program" and made legal provisions for them. Protecting children has become the solemn responsibility and honorable cause of the people's country. Children across the country, especially the children of the working people, will forever enjoy the state's most sincere care and will receive the state's cultivation and education. Our generation has overthrown the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and overthrown it forever; we are beginning to build a new democratic life; we must also create better living conditions for our next generation. We believe that the provisions stipulated in the Common Program will be fully realized with the recovery and development of the national economy. A series of new children's work, from better protection of the health, entertainment and all educational facilities for mothers, infants and children, will be gradually established. Excellent children's workers will be rewarded by the state, and their work will be recognized by society as the most noble and honorable cause.
    But we still need to go through a long struggle to enable every Chinese child to have a happy life. Today, as we review our children's work, we especially feel the great responsibility of our educators.
    The old society's views, methods and habits of treating children still dominate to a certain extent. The habit of beating and scolding children is still common in most families across the country, and even in our primary schools, it is still partially present. Many acts that harm children's innocence, such as unreasonably suppressing or restricting children's due activities and treating children as adults, are still common. Everyone is used to it, and no one finds it strange. As for the adverse effects on children's physical and mental health due to parents' ignorance, superstition, unsanitary habits, prejudices, narrow-mindedness, selfishness, etc., it is even more impossible to describe them all.
    Naturally, changing these situations is a long-term educational problem, but today we should no longer regard these old habits as merely personal matters. Society should criticize and condemn these old habits at any time, and at the same time carry out necessary and possible education for parents. Transforming family education should be listed as an item of attention in our education.
    Primary school education must be gradually popularized in accordance with the steps of national construction. Attention must be paid to pre-school education. The existing primary school education must be improved. First of all, the phenomenon of corporal punishment of children must be thoroughly eliminated, and the views of neglecting children's health, not paying attention to children's physical exercise, and simply focusing on imparting knowledge must be corrected; at the same time, we must prevent all so-called child-centered views that start solely from children's interests and experiences and despise the guiding role of teachers. Teachers must re-examine child psychology with a new perspective, that is, a truly scientific perspective, criticize the erroneous ideological influence of bourgeois psychology they have received in the past, especially the influence of bourgeois so-called child study. Reconsider and establish a new attitude and new educational methods towards children. In short, on June 1st, our primary school teachers and child care workers must thoroughly examine their work, improve their work, and do their work better.
    In our school education and social education, we must use various methods to cultivate new democratic children; these children should be healthy, disciplined, and have the virtues of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property. To carry out this new moral education, we must naturally suit the children's age, use concrete and vivid things, subtle methods, and the influence and suggestion of teachers' own exemplary actions to achieve the purpose of education. We must oppose formalism and dogmatism, and we must oppose acute illnesses. Therefore, teachers must improve their own political, ideological, and scientific cultivation.
    On Children's Day on June 1st, it is especially important to emphasize that our school education should open its doors to the children of workers, peasants and soldiers, and try to absorb as many children of working people who have dropped out of school but can enroll in our schools as possible; we must open schools and literacy classes that use part of the time to attend school for children who do not have enough time to attend school; and strictly protect their physical health.
    We call on all educators, writers and artists, artists, scientists, and cultural workers who care about children's happiness to jointly review all children's publications and pictorials published in the past, especially children's publications such as "Little People's Books"; and create new, ideologically healthy, content-rich, and diverse new readings, pictorials, etc. that children like.
    In short, we should start doing whatever can be done today, and whatever should be prepared to be done today. A place, a school, should not wait for anything that it can do itself.
    To celebrate Children's Day on June 1st, we must let all children who can participate in this festival have a happy day, and we must let more people and parents across the country pay more attention to children's work. We must use improved work related to all children, and step by step promote the work of protecting and educating children, so that the children's work in New China will develop forward day by day.

　　庆祝第一个国际儿童节
    柳湜
    今年六月一日是第一个国际儿童节。我中央人民政府已宣布以六一国际儿童节作为中国儿童自己的节日。为了筹备庆祝六一国际儿童节及响应国际民主妇联等团体发出的“保卫儿童权利、争取和平呼吁书”，我国十一个人民团体和中央人民政府有关儿童工作的部门，组织了盛大的筹备委员会，进行了应有的筹备工作；并号召全国一切关怀儿童幸福的各界人士和父母们，准备在这一天，在全国范围内检阅我们的儿童工作，推进保卫儿童权利事业，建立我们儿童的幸福生活。为了全世界儿童的安全，我们当与各国父母和一切关怀儿童幸福的人们携手，反对帝国主义战争阴谋，争取世界持久和平。新中国的人民已接受了这一国际正义的号召，同时也将保卫儿童权利事业作为自己的国际职责。
    六月一日将是一个盛大的国际节日。在今天，也还是一个国际规模的战斗日。人类正义的光辉，将于保卫儿童权利这一崇高的斗争中，得到发展。世界各国的父母们，将在爱护自己儿童的这一共同基础上团结起来，提高自己的政治觉悟，提高自己的警惕，为争取持久和平而奋斗。全世界的儿童们，将在这一国际节日，增进彼此间的友谊，培育国际主义的精神，促进这一伟大的国际大家庭中更高的兄弟之谊，共同建设自己的美满的新生活。
    六月一日也将是一个真正的中国儿童自己的节日。旧中国只有少数儿童，在狭隘的利己的基础上有一个不健康的儿童节。人民的中国才第一次有了全国的儿童节日。国家第一次关怀到全国的母亲，全国劳动人民的子女，并将“推广卫生医药事业，注意保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康”以及“普及教育”列在《共同纲领》上，加以法律的规定。保护儿童变成了人民的国家的庄严责任、荣誉事业。全国的儿童，首先是劳动人民的儿童将永远享受国家最真诚的关怀，将受到国家的培养与教育。我们这一代的人已把帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的统治推翻了，永远的推翻了；我们正在开始建设新民主主义的新生活；我们还要为我们下一代创造更美满的生活条件。共同纲领中规定的条款，我们相信随着国家经济的恢复与发展必将得到充分的实现。一系列的新的儿童工作，从更良好的保护母亲、婴儿、儿童健康、娱乐到一切教育的设施，必将逐步建立起来。优良的儿童工作者将受到国家的奖励，他们的工作并将被社会公认为最高尚的荣誉的事业。
    但我们要使每一个中国儿童得到幸福的生活还须经过长期奋斗。今天我们检阅我们的儿童工作，我们特别感到我们教育工作者的职责的重大。
    旧社会对待儿童的观点、方法和习惯，现在在一定范围内还占支配的势力。打骂儿童的习惯在全国大多数的家庭中尚普遍存在，甚至我们的小学里，也还不免部分存在着。不合理地压抑或限制儿童应有的活动，把儿童当作成人看待等等观点下许多戕害儿童天真的行为，也还是普遍存在。大家习惯了，谁也不觉奇怪。至于由于父母的无知、迷信、不卫生、偏见、狭隘、自私等等，对儿童身心的不良影响，那更是说不胜说了。
    自然这些情形的改变是一个长期的教育问题，但今天我们却不应再将这类旧习惯看作只是个人的私事，社会应对这类旧习惯，随时加以批评、指责，同时对于父母们进行必要与可能的教育。改造家庭教育应列为我们教育上注意的项目了。
    小学教育必须按照国家建设的步骤，逐渐普及。学前教育必须开始注意。现有的小学教育必须改进。首先应彻底肃清对儿童体罚的现象，纠正忽视儿童健康，不注意儿童身体的锻炼，单纯偏重灌输知识的观点；同时要防止一切单从儿童兴趣与经验出发，轻视教师指导作用的所谓儿童本位的观点。教师们要重新用新的观点，即真正科学的观点，研究儿童心理、批判过去所受资产阶级心理学的错误思想影响，其中尤其是资产阶级所谓儿童学的影响。重新考虑并树立对儿童的新的态度，新的教育方法。总之，在六一节，我们的小学教师，儿童保育工作者，要彻底检查自己的工作，改进自己的工作，把自己的工作做得更好。
    在我们的学校教育、社会教育方面，要用各种方法培养新民主主义的新儿童；这些儿童应是康健的、守纪律的，具有爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物等美德的新儿童。我们进行这新道德教育，自然要切合儿童的年龄，用具体的、生动的事物，潜移默化的方法，教师自己的模范行动的影响与暗示，以达到教育的目的。要反对形式主义、教条主义，要反对急性病。因此，教师们就要提高自己的政治、思想、科学的修养。
    在六一儿童节要特别强调我们学校教育要为工农兵子女开门，要设法使失学而又可以入学的劳动人民子女，尽量吸收到我们学校里来；要为尚不能有全部时间上学的儿童，开办利用部分时间上学的学校、识字班；并严格保护他们身体的健康。
    我们号召一切教育工作者，文艺作家，美术家，科学家，及关怀儿童幸福的文化工作者，共同来检查过去出版的一切儿童读物、画刊，尤其是“小人书”等类儿童出版物；并为儿童创作新的，思想健康的，内容充实的，为儿童所喜悦的，多种多样的新读物、画刊等等。
    总之，凡今天办得到的事，凡今天就应准备开始做的事，我们就应着手来做。一个地方，一个学校，凡是自己可以办得到的事，就不应等待。
    庆祝六一儿童节，要让凡能参加这一节日的儿童尽情快乐一天，要让全国更多的人以及父母们更多多地注意儿童工作。我们要用改进一切有关儿童的工作，并一步步推进保卫、教育儿童的工作，使新中国的儿童工作一天天的向前开展。
