　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 28th -- The vast tea-producing areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, which had been barren for a long time, have begun to recover with the support of the Central South District Company of the China Tea Corporation. The Central South District Company of the China Tea Corporation has completed the distribution of its 1950 spring tea loans, with 54,844 tea farmers receiving nearly 10 billion yuan in tea loans. From April 12th to the present, various regions have purchased 85,000 dan of red rough tea and 12,270 dan of green rough tea; it is estimated that within the next month, the annual task of collecting 114,400 dan of red rough tea and 17,160 dan of green rough tea will be completed. Currently, more than 100 state-owned tea factories in the tea-producing areas are actively rushing to manufacture machines in preparation for tea production.

　　Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are major tea-producing regions in China, with tea-producing areas spread across more than 40 counties including Wuning, Xiushui, Tonggu, Fuliang, Anhua, Xinhua, and Pingjiang in these three provinces. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the annual tea production was nearly 900,000 dan, mainly sold to the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia. After the start of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, internal and external transportation was interrupted, and tea sales were greatly affected. In recent years, Kuomintang bureaucrat-capitalists have long suppressed purchase prices, coupled with the Kuomintang bandit gang's implementation of reactionary foreign policies, cutting off the main sales markets in the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, resulting in long-term stagnation in tea sales. Tea prices plummeted to the point where tea farmers lamented that "carrying a dan of tea to sell is not as good as carrying a dan of firewood to sell." Tea farmers cut down tea trees and switched to planting miscellaneous grains. In 1948, Jiangxi Province produced only 28,000 dan of tea, a decrease of more than 90 percent compared with previous annual production. Eighty percent of the tea mountains in Hunan Province were also barren.

　　After the liberation of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, through large-scale purchases by local people's governments and state-owned trading companies, and assistance in restoring tea production in public and private tea factories, the tea production situation gradually improved. In January and February of this year, the Central South District Company of the China Tea Corporation successively established 38 work stations in various tea-producing areas to distribute tea loans to tea farmers who produced red tea in various places. For every dan of red rough tea produced, tea farmers could borrow six dou of rice. After receiving the loans, tea farmers began to reclaim the long-abandoned tea gardens. For example, Youju Village in Tonggu County, Jiangxi Province, organized ten land reclamation teams to reclaim tea mountains. As of April 28th, the village had reclaimed 2,812 dan (calculated at three dan of tea mountain land equivalent to one dan of grain land) of tea mountain wasteland, and it is expected that tea production will increase by 1,410 jin in two years. As of May 16th, the Fifth District of Fuliang County, Jiangxi Province, had reclaimed 253 mu of tea wasteland and planted tea on 636 mu. At the same time, in order to promote and improve the production technology of red tea, the Central South District Tea Company printed a large number of instructions on the methods of making red tea, helping tea farmers to gradually improve the old-fashioned tea-making methods.

　　The Central South District Tea Company has established more than 80 purchasing stations in the tea-producing areas, directly purchasing tea from tea farmers, eliminating the extra exploitation of intermediate merchants who suppressed the weight of tea purchases. The company's purchase prices are appropriate, and farmers are happy to sell. Every purchasing station has more than 2,000 people coming to sell tea every day. The purchasing power of tea farmers has also been relatively improved, and the market transaction has become very active.

　　中南贷款扶助茶产  茶农积极垦复茶山
    年收茶叶十三万担任务即将完成
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】荒芜已久的湖南、湖北、江西三省广大茶区，在中国茶业公司中南区公司的扶助下，业已开始复苏。中国茶业公司中南区公司一九五○年的春茶贷款，业已发放完毕，五万四千八百四十四户茶农得到了将近一百亿元的茶叶贷款。自四月十二日到目前止，各地已收购红毛茶八万五千担，绿毛茶一万二千二百七十担；预计自目前起的一个月内，即可完成年收红毛茶十一万四千四百担、绿毛茶一万七千一百六十担的任务。目前茶区的一百多家国营茶厂正在积极赶制机器，准备制茶。
    湖南、湖北、江西均为我国主要产茶地区，茶区遍布在该三省之武宁、修水、铜鼓、浮梁、安化、新化、平江等四十余县。抗战前年产茶叶约近九十万担；向以远销苏联、外蒙古为主。一九三七年抗日战争开始后，内外交通中断，茶叶销路大受影响。近年来国民党官僚资本长期压价收购，加之国民党匪帮实施反动的外交政策，断绝了苏联、外蒙古，主要销售市场，致使茶叶长期滞销，茶价跌落到各地茶农所称“挑一担茶卖，不如挑一担柴卖”的惨境。茶农纷纷砍去茶树，改种杂粮。一九四八年江西省产茶仅二万八千担，与以往年产量相较，减少了百分之九十以上。湖南全省茶山荒芜亦达百分之八十。
    湖南、湖北、江西三省解放后，经各地人民政府和国营贸易公司的大量收购，并帮助恢复公私营茶厂的制茶生产，茶叶生产情况遂渐次好转。今年一、二月份，中国茶业公司中南区公司先后在各茶区设立三十八个工作站，发放茶贷，贷给各地产制红茶的茶农。茶农每产红毛茶一担，即可借到六斗米的贷款。茶农得到贷款后，即着手垦复久已废弃了的茶园。如江西省铜鼓县幽居村组织了十个开荒小组，垦复茶山，到四月二十八日止，该村已开出了两千八百十二担（按三担茶山地折合一担谷地）面积的茶山荒地，预计两年后可增产茶叶一千四百一十斤。江西省浮梁县五区至五月十六日止，已开出茶荒二百五十三亩，植茶六百三十六亩。同时，为推广和提高红茶的产制技术，中南区茶业公司印发了大批制红茶方法说明书，帮助茶农逐渐改进旧式的制茶方法。
    中南区茶业公司在茶区设立了八十多个收购站，直接向茶农收购茶叶，免除了居间商人压秤收茶的额外剥削。该公司收购价格适宜，农民乐于脱售。每一收购站每天总有二千多人来出卖茶叶。茶农的购买力也由此而相对提高，市场的交易也大为活跃。
