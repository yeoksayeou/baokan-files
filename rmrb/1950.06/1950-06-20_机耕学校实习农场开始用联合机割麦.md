　　The Mechanized Farming School's Practice Farm Begins Using Combine Harvesters

    [Our Newspaper] All of the Mechanized Farming School's practice farm's more than 630 mu of wheat is ripe, and the school began harvesting all of the wheat yesterday (the 19th) using newly arrived Soviet automatic combine harvesters and Stalin No. 6 tractor combine harvesters. When female tractor driver Ji Fengying and others started the two combine harvesters with a roar, bundles of wheat ears were drawn into the harvesters, and piles of golden wheat grains poured into the iron boxes. The farmers and visitors surrounding the wheat field were extremely excited. At the same time, the school also held a mechanized farming exhibition. The exhibition included briefings on national state farms and briefings on Soviet collective farms, as well as the teaching and student life of the school. In addition, there were a large number of newly arrived Soviet agricultural machines, including various types of tractors and new agricultural implements.

    [Another Report] In order to adapt to the use of a large number of newly arrived Soviet combine harvesters by national state farms for this summer's wheat harvest, the Ministry of Agriculture held a combine harvester training class at the Shuangqiao Mechanized Farming School from May 7th to 20th, transferring 43 of the farms' more technically skilled tractor drivers for intensive study for two weeks. The trainees have now been assigned to various farms to carry out wheat harvesting work.

　　机耕学校实习农场开始用联合机割麦
    【本报讯】机耕学校实习农场六百三十余亩小麦已全部成熟，该校已于昨（十九）日开始用苏联新运到的自动联合收割机和斯大林六号拖拉联合收割机收割全部麦子。当女拖拉机手冀丰盈等将两部收割机隆隆发动后，麦穗一束束的卷入收割机中，金黄的麦粒一堆一堆的涌入铁箱。麦田四周围观的农民与参观者都极为振奋。同时，该校并举行了机耕展览会。展览内容有各国营农场的简报和苏联集体农场的简报以及该校的教、学生活等。此外并有大批苏联新运到的农业机器，包括各型拖拉机和各种新农具。

    【又讯】农业部为了适应各国营农场使用苏联新运到的大批联合收割机进行今夏的麦收工作，曾于五月七日至二十日在双桥机耕学校举办了一期收割机训练班，将各场技术比较熟练的拖拉机手调来四十三人突击学习了两个星期。现受训学员已分配到各农场进行麦收工作。
