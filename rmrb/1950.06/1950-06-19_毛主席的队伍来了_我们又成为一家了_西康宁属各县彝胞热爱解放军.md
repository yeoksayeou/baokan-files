Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing - Since a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Southwest Military Region liberated Xichang and entered various counties of Ning Prefecture, they have been warmly loved by the local Yi compatriots. An unprecedented close unity has been demonstrated between the Yi and Han brothers. On April 17th, Yi compatriots Gejimu Gu, He Daxue, and 48 people including local chieftains Amila Que and Awen Aqiao from Liangshan Zhaojue and other places in Puge, Yuejun, and Ningdong counties, representing all Yi compatriots in the area, presented a flag to a certain division of the People's Liberation Army that liberated Ning Prefecture. At the flag presentation ceremony, the commander of the garrison troops gave a speech detailing the Central People's Government's policy on ethnic minorities and encouraged the Yi people to actively participate in labor and production. Yi compatriot representative Gejimu Gu said in his reply: "The Han and Yi people were originally one family, but the historical feudal rulers and the Kuomintang reactionaries separated us for thousands of years. We have suffered enough from the Kuomintang's Great Han chauvinist rule and oppression. Since Chairman Mao's troops and the People's Government arrived, we have become a family again. We have seen the sky and the sun. In the past, who among the Yi people dared to come to Xichang? But today we can hold meetings here. We will definitely respond to the commander's call and everyone will participate in labor and production." Then, everyone joyfully performed songs and dances, exchanging harmonious and loving ethnic sentiments.

Furthermore, more than 300 Yi compatriots Wang Jimin, Gejima Da, and A He Renli, who live in a mountainous area in Yuejun, recently went to Yuejun County to pay their respects to the local garrison commander and received a warm reception. The garrison troops and the Yi compatriots held a grand get-together of more than a thousand people. Yi compatriots who could speak Chinese shouted loudly, asking the cultural troupe to perform more. Yi compatriot Heilie Jianda automatically picked up his folk musical instrument and began to play. Gejima Da said with emotion and affection: "Such a thing has never happened before!"

　　毛主席的队伍来了  我们又成为一家了
    西康宁属各县彝胞热爱解放军
    【新华社重庆电】人民解放军西南军区某部，自解放西昌进驻宁属各县后，受到当地彝族同胞的热烈爱戴。彝、汉两兄弟民族间显示了从来未有的亲密团结。四月十七日，普格、越隽、宁东等县彝胞戈及母谷、何打西和凉山昭觉等地土司阿米拉且、阿稳阿巧等四十八人，代表该区全体彝胞，向解放宁属的人民解放军某师献旗。驻军首长在献旗典礼上致词时详细说明中央人民政府的少数民族政策，并勉励彝胞们努力参加劳动生产。彝胞代表戈及母谷致答词时说：“汉人和彝人原本是一家，历史上的封建统治者们和国民党反动派，使我们两族分离了几千年。国民党的大汉族主义的统治压迫，我们早已经受够了。自从毛主席的队伍和人民政府来了，我们又成为一家了。我们见了天，见了太阳。过去彝人谁敢来西昌？而今天我们能够在这里开会了。我们一定响应首长的号召，人人参加劳动生产。”接着，大家欢乐地表演歌舞，交流着融洽友爱的民族感情。
    又住在越隽境某山区的彝胞王济民、哥几马打、阿何仁李等三百余人，不久前曾赴越隽县城进谒当地驻军首长，受到亲切的接待。驻军和彝胞并举行了千余人的盛大联欢会。能说汉语的彝胞高声地欢叫着，要求文工团多多演奏。彝胞黑烈剪打自动拿起他随身携带的民间乐器演奏起来。哥几马打感慨而亲切地说：“这样的事情，过去从来没有过！”
