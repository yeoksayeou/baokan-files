    Cadres Lack Understanding of RMB Promotion
    Black Market for Silver Dollars Still Serious in Baiyang, Fanshi
    [This newspaper's Xin County dispatch] In Fanshi County, Xin County Special District, Shanxi, some administrative and bank cadres lack sufficient understanding of the prohibition of silver dollars and the promotion of RMB, which has prevented the rapid elimination of silver dollar activity, greatly affecting the exchange of goods between Shanxi and Hebei provinces. Although the special district has designated the county as a key county for gold and silver management, conducting publicity, redemption, and focused audits of accounts, the ideological resistance of cadres is significant, so black market activity for silver dollars remains serious. Even the county magistrate of Bai stated that gold and silver management was the bank's business, shirking his own responsibility. Furthermore, some supply and marketing cooperative cadres even used silver dollars to invest in private businesses as capital. These serious phenomena must be corrected immediately. County magistrate and other leaders must vigorously organize the promotion of RMB in rural areas to implement the elimination of silver dollar circulation in the market.

    干部对推行人民币认识不足
    繁峙白洋暗市仍严重
    【本报忻县讯】山西忻县专区繁峙县，部分行政、银行干部对禁用银洋、推行人民币认识不足，致使白洋活动未能迅速肃清，对晋、冀两省物资交流影响极大。该县虽经专署作为全区金银管理重点县和进行宣传、收兑及重点抽查账目，但因干部思想阻力很大，故白洋暗市活动仍很严重。甚至该县白县长认为金银管理工作是银行的事，以推卸自己的责任。还有供销社干部竟以白洋投入私营商号作为资金的。这些严重现象亟应改正，县长等领导人员必须大力组织人民币下乡，以贯彻肃清银洋在市场上的流通。
