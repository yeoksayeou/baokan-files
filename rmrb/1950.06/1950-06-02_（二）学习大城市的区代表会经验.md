    (II) Learning from the Experience of District Representative Assemblies in Large Cities
    The district people's representative assemblies in large cities are now opening, starting with the Sixth District in Beijing. This marks a new development in the construction of people's democratic political power in large cities.
    According to the "Organizational Regulations for the People's Representative Assemblies of All Circles in Beijing Districts," at present, this assembly is "an advisory body for the District People's Government (District Office) to convey policies and connect with the masses." Its powers are: "1. To assist the District People's Government in implementing the municipal government's policies and plans, and to promote various tasks. 2. To reflect the opinions and demands of the people to the government. 3. To listen to the work reports of the District People's Government (District Office), discuss matters related to municipal construction and welfare undertakings in each district, and offer criticisms and suggestions. 4. To assist the District People's Government (District Office) and the Public Security Sub-bureau in maintaining public order and consolidating revolutionary order." To summarize the nature and functions of this assembly, it means that the people of each district discuss their own affairs, enabling the district government to be directly supervised and criticized by the people of that district.
    The district people's representative assemblies that have been and are being convened in Beijing are established based on these principles. From the enthusiasm of the representative election campaign in recent days and the large number of proposals and opinions collected, it can be seen how urgently the people need such an assembly within a district to concretely solve their various personal problems. The Sixth District People's Representative Assembly, which has already opened, has received more than two thousand proposals and collected residents' opinions. Some of these are related to residents' health and welfare, while others are reviews and criticisms of the work style of government staff. This not only establishes a broader and closer connection between the government and the people, giving the people the opportunity to fully express their opinions and work with the government; but also places the work of the government and its staff under the supervision of the people, subject to examination and criticism. This facilitates improving the efficiency of political power, improving work style, maintaining the purity of the people's political power, and overcoming shortcomings and errors such as bureaucracy, commandism, and corruption. The People's Government and all staff, including Communist Party members, can only maintain and develop the viewpoint and style of serving the people wholeheartedly by establishing broad and close ties with the masses and undergoing regular training through criticism and self-criticism. The District People's Representative Assembly is precisely such a training ground, and should especially play such a role.
    The convening of district people's representative assemblies in Beijing is an initial experiment in large cities, and efforts should be made to conduct it well. The good experiences of this experiment should not only be promoted well in other districts of Beijing, but also be valued in other similar large cities.

    （二）学习大城市的区代表会经验
    大城市中的区各界人民代表会议，现在首先在北京市的第六区开幕了。这是大城市人民民主政权建设工作的一个新的发展。
    根据“北京市区各界人民代表会议组织通则”，在目前，这个会议是“区人民政府（区公所）传达政策、联系群众的协议机关”。它的职权是：“一、协助区人民政府贯彻市人民政府的施政方针和计划，推行各项工作。二、向政府反映人民的意见和要求。三、听取区人民政府（区公所）的工作报告，讨论有关各区的市政建设工作和福利事业，并提出批评和建议。四、协助区人民政府（区公所）及公安分局维持治安、巩固革命秩序”。把这个会议的性质和职权归纳起来，就是：各区人民自己的事，由各区人民自己商讨，使区政府能够直接受到各该区人民的监督与批评。
    北京市已开和准备召开的区各界人民代表会议，就是根据这样的原则建立起来的。从这几天的代表选举运动的热烈和所收集的提案意见数量之多，可以看出在一个区的范围内，人民是怎样迫切地需要这样的一个会议，来具体解决他们切身的各项问题。已经开幕的第六区各界人民代表会议，收到的提案和收集的居民意见有两千多件。其中有一部分是与居民卫生福利等有关的问题，另一部分是对政府工作人员作风的检讨和批评。这不但使政府和人民建立了更广泛密切的联系，使人民有了充分表达意见、与政府协力办事的机会；而且把政府的工作和工作人员放在人民的监督之下，受到考验和批评。这就便利于提高政权工作效能、改善工作作风，保持人民政权的纯洁，克服官僚主义、命令主义和贪污腐化等缺点和错误。人民政府和一切工作人员，包括共产党员在内，要保持和发展全心全意为人民服务的观点和作风，就只有和人民群众取得广泛密切的联系，经过批评和自我批评的经常锻炼，才有可能。区各界人民代表会议正是这样的锻炼场，也特别应该发挥这样的作用。
    北京市召开的区各界人民代表会议，是在大城市首先进行的一个试验，应该努力把它开好。这个试验的良好经验，不但在北京市的其他各区应当很好地加以推广，而且在其他同样的大城市，也应当加以重视。
