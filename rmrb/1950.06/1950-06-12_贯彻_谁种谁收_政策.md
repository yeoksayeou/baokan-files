　　Implement the "Who Plants, Who Harvests" Policy

To the Editor:
    During the land reform last winter, we received land from the landlords, some of which had already been planted with wheat by the landlords. Regarding this wheat, in some places the landlords harvest it, in some places the landlords and peasants divide the harvest, and in other places it belongs to the peasants. We don't know how to handle this. Please explain it to us.
                                                    Tong County, Wang Gui

Comrade Wang Gui:
    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a directive on spring plowing production on March 10, stipulating: "Guarantee the right to harvest for all who cultivate the land. Landlords, in addition to renting out land, if they still have land that they cultivate themselves, their right to harvest the portion of land they cultivate themselves is also guaranteed, but landlords shall not use this as an excuse to forcibly take back land rented to peasants." On June 2, the editorial in this newspaper, "Fully Lead the Summer Harvest and Summer Planting," pointed out: "In areas where land reform was only carried out last winter, the policy of 'whoever plants, harvests, and bears the burden' and 'protecting the fruits of labor' should be resolutely implemented. Wheat fields originally sown by landlords but distributed to peasants should be harvested by the landlords who originally sowed them, and taxes should be paid by the harvester." Therefore, all wheat fields that were self-cultivated and sown by landlords last year, even if they have been distributed to peasants, should be harvested by the landlords this year. If peasants have carried out labor such as fertilizing and weeding after being allocated land already sown by landlords, the harvest should be divided according to the amount of work done by both parties through mutual agreement.

### 贯彻“谁种谁收”政策

　　贯彻“谁种谁收”政策编辑同志：
    我们在去冬土地改革中分得地主的土地，其中有些地已由地主种上小麦。这些小麦，有的地方是地主收，有的地方由地主和农民分收，也有归农民收的。我们不知道应该怎样处理？请编辑同志解释一下。
                                                    通县王贵王贵同志：
    中央人民政府政务院于三月十日发布的关于春耕生产的指示中规定：“保障一切耕种土地者收获的权利，地主除出租土地外，如仍有自耕部分土地者，其自耕部分土地的收获权利亦在保障之列，但地主不得借此强迫收回出租给农民的土地。”六月二日，本报社论“全力领导夏收夏播”一文中指出：“去冬才进行土地改革地区，应坚决执行‘谁种谁收谁负担’，‘保护劳动所得’的政策。原由地主下种的麦田而分给农民者，应由原下种的地主收割，并由收割者纳税。”因此，凡去年由地主自耕自种的麦田，即使已经分给农民，今年亦应由地主收割。如果农民在分得地主已下种之土地后，进行过施肥锄草等劳作，应按双方施工的多少协议分收。
