　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 7th: The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has completed the warehouse material cleanup. The warehouse material cleanup of the commission began in early April. By the end of May, according to preliminary statistics from the provincial river affairs bureaus and their subordinate organizations at all levels, the value of stored materials in various locations, including vehicles, boats, machinery, and equipment, excluding those currently in use, was equivalent to over 21 million jin of millet. This cleanup provided the commission with relatively accurate figures for its stored materials for the first time. After classifying and cataloging all materials and instruments, it greatly facilitated future allocation and inventory. The cleanup also exposed the chaotic state of material management in the past. For example, the accounts of many warehouses did not match the actual stock, and some warehouses had no accounts at all. Corrosion, mildew, rust, and theft of stored materials were also widespread. The total value of various materials that became unusable due to poor storage in various locations amounted to more than 150,000 jin of millet. To improve storage management, the commission decided that each location should inspect warehouses every half month hereafter, conduct a major cleanup twice a year, and periodically evaluate performance to reward the good and punish the bad. Warehouses in various locations should maintain regular contact with and educate the people near the material storage locations to help prevent the continued occurrence of theft and damage.

　　黄河水利委员会仓库清理完毕
    决定今后每半月检查仓库一次
    【新华社开封七日电】黄河水利委员会完成仓库物资清理工作。该会仓库物资清理工作系于四月上旬开始。到五月底止，据各省河务局及其所属各级机构初步统计，各地仓存物资仅车船、机械器材等项，除现用部分外，即值小米二千一百多万斤。该会仓存物资经过这次清理才开始有了比较确切的数字。全部物资仪器经过分类编排后，大为便利于今后的调配和点验。这次清理工作也同时暴露了过去物资保管工作中的混乱现象，如各仓库账目多与实存数不符，有的仓库甚至根本无账可查；各地库存物资腐蚀、霉烂、生锈及被盗的现象也很普遍。各地因保管不善而失去效用的各种物资共折合小米达十五万斤以上。为改进保管工作，该会决定：今后各地每半月应检查一次仓库，每年大清仓两次，定期评定优劣，进行奖惩。各地仓库应经常联系和教育物料所在地附近的人民，帮助防止偷盗破坏等情事的继续发生。
