    Some Doctors at Nankou Railway Hospital Are Irresponsible Regarding Workers' Illnesses
    Request for Investigation of Nankou Railway Hospital
    Cai Peiyin, a train inspector at the Nankou Vehicle Inspection Section of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, fell ill in April during the "Welcoming Red May" competition. His nephew, Cai Xuepeng (deputy station master at Xizhimen), sent him to Nankou Railway Hospital for treatment on April 29th. The doctor diagnosed typhoid fever, and the uncle and nephew requested hospitalization. Dr. Wu of the hospital said, "This kind of illness, we just can't admit." Cai Xuepeng pleaded for a long time, but Dr. Wu actually said, "If you want to stay, then stay, but we won't be responsible for life or death!"

    After Cai Peiyin was admitted to the ward, doctors rarely visited him except for nurses giving him injections. Even when they did go, they only asked, "Is there a fever?" and then left. After Cai Peiyin was admitted, the nurses never gave him a bath. Feces and urine stuck to the bedding and were only changed every two or three days. When Cai Peiyin's family visited him, he cried to them, "The bedding is very thin, and it's uncomfortable to sleep on the wire bed; there are many flies, and no one cares." At the same time, the family found a wound on his leg that was inflamed and festering. Only after the family requested the院长 to do so, was an operation performed on May 19th to drain over 1000 CC of pus. The next day, the patient fell into a coma, but the doctor did not come to examine him, only telling the nurse to take a look. The patient's family requested a transfer to another hospital, but Dr. Wu said, "It's the same in Beijing, he might die as soon as he gets on the train." The patient's family had to inform the Vehicle Inspection Section's trade union, which arranged for Cai Peiyin to be sent to the Beijing Railway Station Hospital for treatment. When the nurses at that hospital bathed the patient, it was difficult to remove the dried feces from his body. Then, four or five doctors examined and diagnosed the patient, and immediately administered a 400 CC blood transfusion.

    Some doctors at the Nankou Railway Hospital have always been irresponsible regarding the diagnosis and treatment of workers' illnesses. Worker Wang Fengqi said, "When I went for a physical examination, Dr. Wu disliked my odor and refused to examine me." Zhou Deshui said, "When I was cleaning a train car, I accidentally cut my hand, and it became inflamed. The surgeon operated, and as a result, he cut off my tendons, crippling my hand." We hope that the Nankou Railway Hospital will conduct a thorough investigation of this situation and publish the results in the newspaper.

### 南口铁路医院部分医生对工人疾病不负责任  望南口铁路医院进行检查

　　南口铁路医院部分医生对工人疾病不负责任
    望南口铁路医院进行检查
    京绥铁路南口检车段列车检查工人蔡培荫，在四月份开展迎接红五月的竞赛时病了，他的侄子蔡学鹏（西直门副站长）于四月二十九日送他到南口铁路医院诊治，医生断定为伤寒病，叔侄俩即请求住院。该院吴医师说：“像这种病，就是不能收。”蔡学鹏同志央告了很久，吴医师竟说：“要住就住，死活不管！”
    蔡培荫住进病房后，除护士给他打针外，医生很少去，偶而去了一趟，也不过问问“烧不烧啊”，问了就走。蔡培荫入院后，护士就没有给他洗过澡，屎尿粘在被褥上，两三天才换一次，蔡培荫的家属去探望他时，他哭着对他的家人说：“被褥很薄，睡铁丝床难受；苍蝇多，没人管。”同时，家属发现他的腿上有伤，并且发炎溃烂了。后经家属向院长请求，才在五月十九日给他开刀抽脓千余ＣＣ。第二天病人昏迷过去，医生也不来诊视，只叫护士看看就算了。病人家属要求转院，吴医师说：“去北京也是这样，一上火车说不定就死了。”病人家属只得告诉检车段工会，即由工会设法将蔡培荫送到北京车站铁路医院医治。该院护士给病人洗澡时，干结在病人身上的屎，好不容易才洗掉，接着四、五个医生围绕病人进行检查、诊断，并立即施行补血四百ＣＣ。
    南口铁路医院部分医生，对诊治工人疾病，向不负责。工人王凤岐说：“我去检查身体时，吴医师嫌我臭，不给检查。”周德水说：“我扫车时因不慎碰破手，发炎，外科医师开刀，结果把筋都给我切断了，使我的手成了残废。”我们希望南口铁路医院对这种情况进行彻底检查，并将检查结果在报上公布。
