　　State-owned Jingxing Coal Mine Exposes Clique Boss Elements
　　[Report from this newspaper] The movement to abolish the remnants of the feudal clique boss system in the Jingxing Coal Mine is currently being vigorously promoted. From early April to early May, the administrative side of the mine initially suppressed the arrogance of the clique bosses, removing thirty-one clique boss elements from their positions. At this time, some deviations occurred in the movement. The main reasons were: the administrative side did not promptly train worker activists to establish strong core leadership organizations; the Party and the Communist Youth League did not provide effective coordination and guarantees; the administrative side's analysis of the clique bosses was unclear, treating big bosses, second-in-commands, middle managers, and chief inspectors all as clique bosses. As a result, the masses developed ideological concerns, fearing that they would be attacked; the remaining clique boss elements took the opportunity to threaten workers and confront the administrative leadership. They also fabricated rumors to undermine worker unity and incite workers to be passive and slack off, which affected production.
　　On May 9th, the administrative负责人 (responsible person) of the mine reviewed the above-mentioned shortcomings and made new overall arrangements. It was decided to carry out the anti-clique boss system movement in a planned and step-by-step manner. From May 13th, the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organized two work groups to hold small-scale worker discussion meetings to stimulate worker enthusiasm for struggle; to hold short-term training classes for Party members, Communist Youth League members, and worker activists; and to organize three propaganda teams to carry out extensive propaganda work. By May 25th, the propaganda and mobilization phase had ended. The mine is now exposing clique boss elements and revealing their crimes. This will be combined with organizational rectification and re-election of the factory management committee, striving to end the anti-clique boss system movement by the end of June.

　　国营井陉煤矿检举把头分子
    【本报讯】井陉煤矿废除封建把头残余运动，现正大力推进中。从四月初到五月上旬，该矿行政方面，即曾初步镇压了把头的凶焰，将三十一个把头分子撤职。这时候，运动发生了一些偏差。主要原因是：行政方面没有及时训练工人积极分子，建立强有力的核心领导组织；党和团没有进行有力的配合和保证；行政方面对把头分析不清，把大头子、二头子、中岔、总查一律当把头处理。结果，群众产生思想顾虑，害怕自己受打击；残留的把头分子乘机威胁工人，和行政领导上对抗。并捏造谣言，破坏工人团结。鼓动工人消极怠工，使生产受到影响。
    五月九日，该矿行政负责人检讨了上述的缺点，又重新作了全面部署。决定有计划有步骤地开展反把头制度运动。从五月十三日起，党、政、工、团组织了两个工作组，普遍召开小型工人座谈会，启发工人斗争积极性；举办党、团员及工人积极分子短期训练班；并组织了三个宣传队，广泛开展宣传工作。到五月二十五日止，宣传动员阶段已经结束。现该矿正检举把头分子，揭发把头罪恶。将结合整顿组织，改选工厂管理委会，争取六月底结束反把头制度运动。
