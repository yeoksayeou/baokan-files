Since its establishment in April, the Northwest Fur Company has established more than a dozen branches in Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, and Yinchuan to prepare for the large-scale purchase of Northwest's famous specialty, casings. It is estimated that the annual output of casings in the Northwest region reaches about 4 million pieces, of which Xinjiang sheep casings account for the largest share in the country.
