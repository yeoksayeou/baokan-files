　　The first season of school production has yielded harvests.
    Most schools have succeeded in improving student diets.
    A few schools do not pay enough attention to production and need to correct this urgently.
    [This newspaper reports] The first season of after-school production in major universities and middle schools in Beijing has generally been harvested. With the exception of a very few schools, students in all schools have generally enthusiastically responded to the call to participate in practical work and have made considerable achievements, partially improving the diets of the students.

    In mid-March, major universities and middle schools in this city, under the call of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, and under the leadership of the Municipal School Production Steering Committee, launched production. A total of 87 public and private universities and middle schools in the city, with more than 37,000 people participating, obtained 1,725.4 mu of land; the government also provided loans of more than 374,800 jin of millet to subsidize production funds. The schools formed seven middle school groups and three university groups according to region, and exchanged experiences, learned from each other, and helped each other through small group leader joint meetings, briefings, reporting systems, and mutual observation. The first season's production yielded a small harvest due to the long land preparation time after the land was distributed and the small number of early seedlings planted. Due to different management methods and technologies in each school, there were also differences in harvest results.

    China-France University and North China Middle School are better in terms of production planning, leadership, labor organization, discipline, and students' labor morale. China-France University began harvesting cabbage on June 5. Now, this one vegetable alone can yield 200 jin per day. Each cabbage weighs an average of 1.5 jin, and the cost is 150 yuan. It is sold to students at 70% of the market price, about 400 yuan per head. Lima beans can be harvested more than 300 jin each time, and other spinach, Chinese cabbage, radishes, etc. are all close to standard yields. Students only take turns doing two hours of production labor once every two weeks. The school's dining hall has 270 people, and in the past, the daily vegetable cost was 100,000 yuan. Now, buying vegetables produced by themselves is half the price of the market price, which can save 50,000 yuan in food costs per day. Therefore, the diet has been improved. The school has the largest amount of loans among universities, but according to the person in charge of the farm, they are confident that they will pay off the loans this year. North China Middle School harvested more than 4,000 jin of vegetables in the second half of May, and the nutrition of more than 530 students was initially improved. Since farm products were sold to the dining hall at 40% of the market price, the students in the dining hall could eat vegetables every day. Since June 1, with the increase in harvest volume, the students in the dining hall can now eat two meals of vegetables every day, which is a significant improvement compared to the past when they could only eat one or two meals of vegetables a week. In the past, the Huaguang Girls' Middle School dining hall had poor meals due to low meal fees, and students ate pickles almost every day. Only when there was a surplus at the end of the month could they eat one or two meals of vegetables. After the farm was harvested, each person could eat more than 20 jin of vegetables in May. Although the after-school production results of most other schools are not as good as those of China-France University and other schools, they can generally improve the diets of students with the harvested products.

    Some schools lack production plans or are eager to recoup their capital, resulting in a surplus of a certain vegetable at a certain period, forcing them to sell it to vegetable merchants; or, vegetables cannot be supplied at a certain period, so students cannot eat vegetables. For example, Girls' No. 2 Middle School sold all 208 spinach ridges (average yield of 70 jin per ridge) to vegetable merchants at 8,000 yuan per ridge. Chinese cabbage was sold to vegetable merchants for 233 ridges at an average of 5,200 yuan per ridge. The scallions of Yude Middle School produced about 100 jin per ridge and were sold to vegetable merchants for 221 ridges at 12,000 yuan per ridge, and the students only ate 7 ridges. Although the 225 ridges of spinach were all sold to the students, the yield was too much to eat all at once. Although the spinach in Girls' No. 2 Middle School and the scallions in Yude Middle School were sown when the land was planted, these shortcomings of temporary overproduction or temporary inability to eat vegetables may be avoided if there is a good plan for this.

    In addition, some schools do not pay enough attention to production and are not responsible enough. The university collective farm in the southern suburbs (Peking University, Jiaotong University, Normal University, Hui Nationality College) was allocated 139 mu of arable land, of which 130 mu were paddy fields and only 9 mu were garden land, but they were not well managed, and some land was still left vacant. The four schools have a labor force of 3,000 people, with Peking University contributing 1,500 people, Normal University contributing 750 people, and Jiaotong University and Hui Nationality College contributing a total of 750 people. However, as of June 6, Peking University students went there six times, with no more than 300 people. In the past three months, the four schools have no more than 600 people. According to this number of shifts, each person will only be assigned once every 15 months; even so, some students still take a wait-and-see attitude. Some students at Jiaotong University asked: "Do students from other schools go? If they don't go, we won't go either." Because of insufficient labor, they cannot work in time, which delayed the transplanting period of 4,000 to 5,000 tomato seedlings. At 100 yuan per seedling, the total loss is 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Because not enough labor is provided, the rice fields rely entirely on long-term, monthly, or short-term workers, which greatly increases the cost. The four mu of white land in Yuying Middle School have two "labor exchange" workers who live on the farm for a long time, but they are still not well managed. Xinsheng Second Hospital and Guanghua Girls' Middle School have also wasted a lot of land.

    The current problems in school production are: First, some schools have not clearly realized that the purpose of school production is to improve students' lives, and they have a strong profit-making view. They believe that vegetable prices are low and there is not much profit, so when harvesting vegetables, they are either reluctant to sell them to students or miss the harvest period. It must be clearly understood that the purpose of allocating five li of land per person for school production is to enable each student to eat an average of about two jin of vegetables every day according to the normal harvest volume to improve students' nutrition. Therefore, products should be calculated according to cost and supplied to students at the lowest price. It is right for North China Middle School to sell cabbage to students at 1,000 yuan for 30 jin when the cabbage production is excessive, and vacate the land to rush to plant other vegetables. Second, technical aspects are neglected. Some schools are afraid of spending money and do not use technicians, or use technicians who are not good at technology, which delays production and reduces output. Hebei Normal University planted more than three mu of zucchini, but because the spacing between plants was too sparse, there were actually only seedlings for more than one mu of land, wasting half of the land. This phenomenon must be corrected as soon as possible. Third, the school's production committee and the dining hall do not cooperate well. This creates difficulties in handling products. The Yenching University dining hall does not buy vegetables from the farm if they have some bugs, and the vegetables that are pulled back cannot be sold out. Once, more than 500 jin of vegetables rotted. The Peking University dining hall does not buy vegetables from the farm because they are not cleaned, and goes to the Academy of Fine Arts to buy vegetables. This is a big shortcoming and should be discussed and overcome by both parties. Fourth, the false image of overproduction. A few schools believe that there is too much land and too many vegetables to eat. In fact, five li of land per person will not produce overproduction. The current false image of overproduction is only because the plan for crop rotation is not good and production is carried out blindly. For example, some schools plant hundreds of ridges of one vegetable at a time, and of course they cannot eat it all at once. But in the past ten days and a half months, there were no vegetables to eat. In the future, school production must make detailed crop rotation plans so that there are always products to harvest and continuously supply the students' dining hall for consumption.

    Under the guidance of the Municipal School Production Committee, although the first season of school production had some deviations due to lack of experience and a few schools not grasping the production work tightly enough, generally speaking, there were achievements and harvests. The existing problems are also confident and possible to overcome.

　　学校生产首季已收获
    大部分学校已做到了改善学生膳食
    少数学校对生产不够重视亟应改正
    【本报讯】京市各大、中学校课余生产第一季已普遍收获，除极少数学校外，各校同学一般地都热烈响应号召参加了实际工作，并作出相当成绩，部分地改善了同学的伙食。
    三月中旬，本市各大、中学校在市委、市府号召及市学校生产指导委员会领导下发动了生产。全市公私立大、中学八十七校共三万七千余人参加，分得土地一、七二五·四亩；政府并贷款三十七万四千八百余斤小米，用以辅助生产资金。各校依地区组成七个中学组、三个大学组，通过小组长联席会、通报、汇报制度及彼此观摩，互相交流经验，互学互助。第一季生产，因分地后整地时间较长，且所种早苗不多，故收获量不大。各校管理方法及技术不同，收获成绩也有差别。
    中法大学及华北中学，在生产计划、领导工作、劳动组织、纪律及学生的劳动情绪方面都较好。中法大学于六月五日起收获洋白菜，现在只这一种菜每天就可收到二百斤，一棵菜平均重量一斤半，成本一百五十元，按市价七折售给同学，每棵约四百元。芸扁豆每次可收三百多斤，其他菠菜、小白菜、红萝卜等均接近标准产量。学生每人每两周才轮到一次两小时的生产劳动。该校膳团二百七十人，过去每天菜金十万元。现在购食自己生产的菜，比市价贱二分之一，每天可节省伙食费五万元。因之伙食得到了改善。该校在大学中是贷款数目最大的，但据农场负责人说，他们有信心在今年还清贷款。华北中学五月下半月中，收获了四千多斤菜，五百三十多个同学的营养得到了初步改善。自农场产品以市价百分之四十售给膳团后，就使膳团同学每天能吃到菜。六月一日起，随着收获量增多，膳团同学每天已可吃到两顿菜，比过去每周只能吃一两顿菜的情形显著提高了。华光女中膳团过去由于膳费少，伙食比较差，学生几乎每天都是吃咸菜，到月底有结余时才能吃一两顿菜。农场收获后，五月份每人即可吃到二十多斤菜。其他大多数学校课余生产成绩，虽不如中法大学等校优良，但一般都能以收获之产品改善了同学的伙食。
    部分学校因缺乏生产计划，或急于归本，造成某一时期某种蔬菜产量过剩，被迫卖给菜商；或某一时期菜又供应不上，使同学反倒吃不到菜。如女二中将二百零八畦菠菜（平均每畦产量七十斤），以八千元一畦全部售给菜商。小白菜以每畦平均五千二百元售给菜商二百三十三畦。育德中学的小葱每畦约产一百斤，以每畦一万二千元售给菜商二百二十一畦，同学只吃到七畦。二百二十五畦的菠菜虽都卖给学生，但产量太多，一时吃不完。女二中的菠菜和育德中学的小葱，虽在接种该地时已经播种，但如对此有很好的计划也可能避免一时生产过剩或一时吃不到菜的缺点。
    另外，部分学校对生产还不够重视，不够负责。南郊的大学集体农场（北大、交大、师大、回民学院）分到可耕地一百三十九亩，其中一百三十亩是稻田，只有九亩园地，还经营不好，有些地还空起来。四校的劳动力是三千人，北大出一千五百人，师大出七百五十人，交大和回民学院共出七百五十人。但截至六月六日止，北大学生去了六次不过三百人。三个月来四校不超过六百人。按照这样的人数轮班每人要十五个月才轮到一次；就这样，有的学生还抱着观望态度。交大有的同学问：“别的学校同学去不？如果不去，我们也不去了。”因为劳动力不够，不能及时劳作，使四、五千棵洋柿子苗，都耽误了移植期。按每棵一百元计，共损失四、五十万元。因为出的劳力不够，种稻田也全靠长工、月工或雇用短工，使成本大大增多。育英中学四亩白地，有两个“变工”长期住在农场，但仍经营不好。新生二院和光华女中，也荒废了不少地。
    在学校生产中目前存在的问题是：第一，有些学校没有明确认识学校生产的目的是为了改善同学生活，而有着浓厚的营利观点。他们认为菜价贱，没有多少利，因此在收获菜蔬时，不是舍不得卖给同学，就是误了收获期。必须明确认识到，进行学校生产每人分配五厘地的用意，是要按普通的收获量，使每个学生每天平均都能吃到二斤左右的蔬菜，来改善学生的营养。因此产品应按成本计算，以最低价格供给学生们食用。华北中学在白菜产量过剩时，以一千元三十斤卖给学生，空出地来赶种别种蔬菜，这是很对的。第二，忽视技术。有些学校怕花钱，不用技工，或用技术不好的技工，结果耽误生产使产量受到损失。河北师范种了三亩多西葫芦，因株间太稀，实际只有一亩多地的苗，浪费了二分之一的土地。这种现象必须及早改正。第三，学校的生产委员会和膳团配合不好。这在处理产品时就有了困难。燕京大学膳团对农场的菜有点虫子就不买，拉回去的菜销不完，有一次就烂坏五百多斤。北大膳团因农场的菜整理得不干净不买，而到美术学院去买菜。这是很大的缺点，应该双方商量设法克服。第四，假象的生产过剩。少数的学校认为地多，菜多，吃不了。实际上，每人五厘地是不会生产过剩的。现在生产过剩的假象，只是因为轮种的计划不好，盲目生产，譬如有的学校一种菜就种几百畦，一次收下来，当然吃不了。但过去十天半月又没有菜吃了。今后学校生产必须作详细的轮种计划，使经常有产品收获，不断地供给学生膳团食用。
    第一季的学校生产，在市学校生产委员会的指导下，虽然由于没有经验及少数学校对生产工作抓得不够紧，发生了一些偏向，但一般地说是有成绩有收获的。现在存在的一些问题，也是有信心有可能克服的。
