　　"Schuman Plan" Sparks Increasing Disputes;
    American and British Newspapers Accuse Each Other

Since the National Executive Committee of the British Labour Party issued a public policy statement on June 12th rejecting the American "integration" plan for Western Europe, the tit-for-tat statements made by the United States and Britain on this issue reflect that the contradiction between the United States and Britain on the Schuman Plan has further intensified.

The United States has issued increasingly blatant threats. Hoffman, the administrator of the Marshall Plan and head of the so-called Economic Cooperation Administration, criticized the British Labour Party's rejection of the Schuman Plan on June 15th as "a most unfortunate example of isolationism," and he advocated that "Congress should demand a full explanation before passing new foreign aid appropriations." Senator Kem more explicitly demanded that "Marshall Plan allocations to Britain should be reduced." The New York Times accused the Labour Party's policy statement of being "negative and destructive," and that it "seriously undermined the hopes and plans for European unification," and demanded that "the Labour Party needs to do something to dispel the impression created so far." In addition, according to the USIS, newspaper editorials and columnists across the United States have paid considerable attention to the Labour Party's statement against moving towards European economic unification and the subsequent developments, and most of the comments criticized the possible consequences of the statement.

However, these threatening remarks from the United States have been met with impolite responses from the British bourgeois newspapers. Although these newspapers treated the Labour Party's statement with different attitudes, according to Reuters: they "showed a remarkable consistency, jointly calling on the government to clarify the 'harm' caused by the dispute over the Schuman Plan and rejecting American criticism of Britain." The Times even declared in an editorial on the 16th: "A fact that responsible figures in British political circles have never concealed is that, based on the full and practical reasons arising from our (referring to Britain) position in the world, our country has never supported a European federation or a complete European alliance." The liberal Manchester Guardian retorted to the attacks of the American newspapers, saying: "If any other country made the same arbitrary demands on the US Congress, the US government's attitude would certainly be the same reserved attitude as the Labour government." The conservative Daily Express demanded that the Americans announce that they are willing to incorporate the American coal and iron industry into the plan proposed by Schuman and praised by Acheson, in order to "set an example for Britain."

　　“舒曼计划”引起争吵日多
    美英报纸互相攻讦
    【新华社二十五日讯】自从英国工党全国执行委员会于六月十二日发表公开拒绝美国的西欧“整体化”计划的政策声明以后，美英两国间就这一问题所发表的针锋相对的言论，反映了美英之间在舒曼计划上的矛盾，已进一步尖锐化。
    美国方面发出了越来越露骨的恫吓。马歇尔计划执行人，所谓经济合作总署署长霍夫曼，六月十五日斥责英国工党拒绝舒曼计划一事，是“孤立主义的最不幸例子”，他主张“国会在通过新援外经费之前，应先要求充分解释”。参议员肯姆更明白要求“马歇尔计划对英国的拨款，应予削减”。纽约时报指责工党的政策声明是“消极的，带破坏性的东西”，它“严重地打击了欧洲统一的希望与计划”，并要求“工党需要做一些事情，借以消除迄今造成的印象”。此外，据美新处报道：全美报纸社论及专栏作家都对工党反对走向欧洲经济统一的声明及相继而来的发展，给予颇大注意，评论中大都批评该项声明的可能后果。
    但是美国这些威胁性的言论，却受到了英国资产阶级报纸不客气的答复，虽然这些报纸以不同的态度来对待工党声明，但是据路透社报道：它们却“表现了显著的一致，一同呼吁政府廓清有关舒曼计划的纠纷所引起的‘祸害’，并拒绝美国对英国的批评。”泰晤士报在十六日社论中竟扬言：“英国朝野政界负责人物所从不隐晦的一个事实是：基于我国（指英国）在世界之地位所产生的种种充分而实际的理由，我国就从来没有支持过欧洲联邦或十足的欧洲联盟。”自由党的曼彻斯特卫报更对美国报纸的攻击反唇相讥称：“假如任何其他国家向美国国会提出同样专断的要求，美国政府的态度一定也是采取和工党政府同样的保留态度。”保守党的每日快报要求美国人宣布他们愿意把美国的煤铁工业并入为舒曼所提出而为艾奇逊所称颂的计划中，借以“给英国做个样子看看”。
