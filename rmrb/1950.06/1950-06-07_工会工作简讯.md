　　Union Work Briefs
    Railway workers of the Sui-Bao section are conscientiously studying the new road maintenance method. The GuiSui Office has specially formed the Sui-Bao Section Road Maintenance Committee and held a mobilization meeting for implementing the new road maintenance method. Many workers' family members have now signed up to participate in the study of the new road maintenance work.

    Since its re-election in August last year, the Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot Branch Union has done a lot of work, but due to the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres, who do not go deep into the lower levels, the workers' reasonable demands are not resolved, and the union's accounts are unclear, which has caused the union to lose its prestige. In order to improve the union's work and give play to the union's role in leading production, under the leadership of the superior union, after the workers' deliberation and discussion, a re-election was held on May 17. The union committee is now studying how to overcome past shortcomings, clear up the accounts, take the union work to a higher level, and prepare to launch a rationalization proposal and create a new record movement.

　　工会工作简讯

    石家庄机务段分工会，自去年八月份改选后，虽然作了很多的工作，但是由于领导干部的官僚主义作风，不深入下层，工人的合理要求不加以解决，并且工会账目不清，因而使工会失去威信。为改进工会工作，发挥工会领导生产的作用，在上级工会的领导之下，经过工人的酝酿和讨论，已于五月十七日进行改选。工会委员会现正研究如何克服过去缺点，清点账目，把工会工作提高一步，并准备开展合理化建议及创造新纪录运动。
