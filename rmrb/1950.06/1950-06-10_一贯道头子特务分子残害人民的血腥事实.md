　　The Bloody Facts of the Yi Guan Dao Leader-Secret Agent's Persecution of the People
　　By our reporter Lin Hong
　　The Yi Guan Dao in Beijing has always been a reactionary, feudal, and superstitious organization manipulated by Japanese invaders and Kuomintang secret agents. More than ten years ago, Zhang Wufu, under the order of Zhang Guangbi, came to Beijing to "open up wasteland" (referring to establishing the Dao) and established the so-called "Xin Yi Altar." Under the slogans of "Ten thousand Buddhas return to one" and "No distinction of race in religion" of the Japanese invaders, it was led by the Japanese secret agent leader Mitsuru Toyama, becoming an active supporter of the "Greater East Asia Policy," undermining the War of Resistance against Japan, and serving the Japanese invaders. After Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionaries held training sessions for the Dao altar leaders and above near the Temple of Earth. Thus, the Yi Guan Dao was transformed from an organization that betrayed national interests into an accomplice that supported the "Suppression of the Rebellion Policy" and undermined the people's revolution. After liberation, the upper-level members of the Dao still did not repent and continued to be enemies of the people.
　　The Yi Guan Dao in Beijing had one general altar, thirty-two main altars, and forty-three branch altars. There were a total of 103 altar leaders, 110 point transmitters, and about 100,000 followers. The general altar set up a "Teacher-Master," who was the highest responsible person. The main altars set up altar leaders, point transmitters, etc. These Teacher-Masters, altar leaders, point transmitters, etc., were almost all from hooligan, bully, and landlord backgrounds, and all had participated in the Japanese invaders and Kuomintang reactionaries' secret service organizations. In the semi-feudal and semi-colonial Chinese society, because many peasants, housewives, and some backward merchants and students had strong superstitious ideas, they used tools such as "automatic writing," "spirit possession," and the Four Books and Five Classics to confuse the masses and recruit "Dao relatives." Generally, "believers," because of their backwardness, did not know that the Yi Guan Dao was a reactionary organization manipulated by enemy agents. After being coerced or lured into the Dao, they became the objects of extortion, deception, and insults by the altar leaders and point transmitters. In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and save the innocent people who had gone astray, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested and brought to justice a small number of Yi Guan Dao leaders and secret agent bandits who had committed numerous evils on June 7th. This was unanimously supported by the two million citizens of Beijing.
　　The crimes of the Yi Guan Dao leaders are countless. Just citing some of the following facts can illustrate how they persecuted the people.
　　1. Participating in Japanese invaders and Kuomintang secret service organizations and persecuting the people. For example, Lu Shanting, the altar leader of the Minghua Altar of the Yi Guan Dao, served as a special agent of the Japanese military police and the head of the railway protection team and village head during the Japanese puppet period. During the Kuomintang rule, he joined the Central Statistics Bureau's secret service organization and served as the leader of the commando team. He colluded with the Japanese invaders' garrison captain in Fengtai and the sergeant of the military police to extort money from the villagers and force the masses to repair roads. If the masses were slightly dissatisfied with him, they would be sent to the Japanese military police to be detained or beaten. Zhang Renwei, the point transmitter of the Duo Yi Altar, served as the garrison captain of the six counties in eastern Hebei during the Japanese invaders' rule and was an enemy of our People's Liberation Army. Point transmitter Liu Xiyuan served as the director of the joint guarantee during the Japanese puppet period and killed four of our guerrillas (one shot and three buried alive). During the Kuomintang period, he joined the Central Statistics Bureau and served as the head of the central team, bullying the masses by relying on his power. Sun Hongliang, the "Living閻王" of Tianqiao, was also a follower of the Yi Guan Dao. He used to collude with Ma Hansan, a secret agent of the Kuomintang Military Statistics Bureau, and bullied others by relying on his power. The merchants in the Tianqiao area were afraid of him like a tiger.
　　2. Spreading rumors and carrying out reactionary propaganda. Last November, the instructions of the leading figures of the Dao were found in the home of Yi Guan Dao follower Zhou Chunshen, including statements such as "The leaders of the Yi Guan Dao are the future true masters, and the point transmitters are positions above the county magistrate." This was clearly to incite the Dao followers to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. In January of this year, when the Dao followers held a meeting at the home of the female demon Bai Xiuru, the leading figures of the Dao even fabricated the story that "World War has already broken out, and the American and Japanese troops have arrived in the Northeast." Such actions of creating rumors to confuse the public and opposing the People's Government were the specialty of the leading figures of the Yi Guan Dao.
　　3. Manipulating farmers' associations and threatening the masses. Yi Guan Dao leader and bully Mu Zhaozeng secretly manipulated the farmers' associations in the suburbs of Beijing when the village political power was first established in Beijing after liberation. He also used others to spread rumors, such as saying, "You poor children can't rely on the Eighth Route Army. You can still eat with us," trying to use this to undermine the prestige of the People's Government.
　　4. Using oracular messages to swindle people of their wealth. Liu Jingtai, the point transmitter of the Tonghua Altar, absorbed more than 3,000 Dao followers and swindled incense money amounting to 15,000 catties of corn. "Dao relative" Liu Wenpu spent one hundred shi of corn in the "Universal Salvation of the Three Realms." Wu Xisan spent two gold bars in passing "Duan Fang." Lu Shanting even relied on the power of his predecessors to dominate the countryside. The masses called him "Huoxiezi" (meaning someone who specializes in doing bad things). During his tenure as the Baozhang of the Japanese invaders, he deducted timber to build five houses when the Fengtai Depot collected sleepers from various villages.
　　5. Raping women. The leaders of the Yi Guan Dao mostly used superstitious tricks such as "oracular messages" and "spirit possession" to confuse female "Dao relatives," or raped women in the name of treating diseases. For example, Yang Shengfu, the point transmitter who committed the crime not long ago, raped two widows, Wei Gongshi and others, and two girls aged sixteen to eighteen, and abducted the eighteen-year-old girl. The female point transmitter Bai Xiuru even organized a so-called "Violence Character Team," with men as the backbone, specializing in raping women. The method was to first write the names of the women to be raped on a piece of paper and place it in a plate of offerings of fruit. After burning incense and worshiping, the point transmitter Bai Xiuru would grab a handful of sand and sprinkle it in the air, and then take out the paper, falsely claiming that there were secret words, and call the women listed on the note to a dark room to rape them. After the rape, she would use a small knife to cut the woman's arm and ask if it hurt. Only when the raped person said "it doesn't hurt" would it indicate that the person's "faith is firm." In order to prevent the scandal from being revealed, the "Violence Character Team" had killed some of those who had been raped.

　　一贯道头子特务分子残害人民的血腥事实
    本报记者  林洪
    京市一贯道一向是日寇和国民党特务操纵下的反动、封建、迷信组织。十余年前，张五福奉张光壁之命来京开荒（指办道）办了所谓“信一坛”后，即在日寇“万佛归一”和“信教不分种族”的口号下，为日本特务头子头山满所领导，成为“大东亚政策”的积极拥护者；破坏抗战，为日寇效劳。日本投降后，国民党反动派曾在地坛附近集训该道坛主以上的分子。这样，一贯道便由出卖民族利益的组织变成了拥护“戡乱政策”、破坏人民革命的帮凶。解放后，该道的上层分子仍不知悔改，继续与人民为敌。
    京市一贯道有总坛一个，本坛三十二个，分坛四十三个。共有坛主一百零三人，点传师一百一十人，道徒约十余万人。总坛设师尊，是最高负责人。本坛设坛主、点传师等。这些师尊、坛主、点传师等，差不多都是流氓、恶霸、地主出身，且都曾参加过日寇和国民党反动派的特务组织。在半封建、半殖民地的中国社会，由于许多农民、家庭妇女及一些落后的商人、学生等存在着浓厚的迷信思想，他们便利用“扶乩”、“神附体”及四书五经等为工具，迷惑群众，招收“道亲”。一般“信徒”因为自己的落后性，不知道一贯道是敌特操纵下的反动组织，被胁迫或被引诱入道后，便成了坛主、点传师等敲诈、欺骗和侮辱的对象。京市公安局为了巩固人民民主专政，和拯救误入歧途的无辜人民，于六月七日，将少数作恶多端的一贯道头子特务匪徒逮捕法办。这是京市二百万市民所一致拥护的。
    一贯道头子们的罪行是数不清的，只要举出下面的一些事实，就可以说明他们是怎样残害人民的。
    一、参加日寇和国民党特务组织，残害人民。如一贯道明化坛主吕善庭，日伪时期曾任日本宪兵队特务及铁路爱护班长、爱护村长等职。国民党统治时，又加入中统特务组织，担任突击小组长等职。他曾勾结日寇驻丰台警备队长、宪兵曹长，向村民敲诈勒索，强迫群众修路；群众对他稍有不满，即被送日宪兵队扣押或毒打。铎一坛点传师张仁维，在日寇统治时期，曾任冀东六县警备队长，与我人民解放军为敌。点传师刘燮元曾任日伪时期的联保主任，杀害我游击队四名（枪毙一人，活埋三人）。国民党时期又参加中统局，任中心小组长，仗势欺压群众。天桥活阎王孙鸿亮也是一贯道徒，以前和国民党军统特务马汉三勾搭，仗势欺人，天桥一带商人，畏之若虎。
    二、制造谣言，进行反动宣传。去年十一月在一贯道徒周纯身家中查获了该道首脑人物的指示，其中有“一贯道的首领即是将来的真主，点传师即是县长以上的职位”等语句。这显然是鼓动道徒作反革命活动。今年一月，道徒在女魔白秀茹家中开会时，该道首脑人物还捏造说：“世界大战已经打起来了，美日军已到东北”。类此造谣惑众，反对人民政府的行动，是一贯道首脑人物的拿手好戏。
    三、操纵农会，威胁群众。一贯道头子恶霸穆肇增，于京市刚一解放开始建立村政权时，即在京郊暗中操纵农会；并利用别人散布谣言，如说：“你们这些穷孩子靠八路军不行，靠我们这些人还能吃碗饭”，想借此打击人民政府的威信。
    四、利用乩语，骗取民财。同化坛点传师刘景泰吸收道徒三千余人，骗取香资先后达玉米一万五千斤。“道亲”刘文圃在“普渡三曹”中，花了一百石玉米。吴锡三在渡“端方”时，花了两条金子。吕善庭更借其前人势力称霸乡间，群众都叫他“豁子”（专搞坏事之意）。他在当日寇的保长任内，曾乘丰台机务段向各村征收枕木时，克扣木材盖了五间房子。
    五、强奸妇女。一贯道的头子，多以“乩语”及“神附体”等迷信技俩迷惑女“道亲”，或以治病为名，强奸妇女。如不久前犯案的点传师杨生甫，就曾奸污魏龚氏等两个寡妇及十六——十八岁的两名少女，并将十八岁的少女拐走。女点传师白秀茹更组织了所谓“暴字队”，以男人为骨干，专门强奸妇女。其方法是，先将欲奸污的妇女的名字写在纸条上，放在供奉水果的盘里。烧香礼拜后，由点传师白秀茹抓一把沙子撒在空中，然后将纸条取出，伪称有密言，将列名条上的妇女唤至暗室，即行奸污。强奸后，复用小刀划该妇女之臂，问其是否痛。直至被奸污者说“不痛”，才表示此人“信心坚定”。“暴字队”为了不使丑事泄露，曾杀害过被奸污者。
