　　Comrade Yang Ruixuan Suggests Establishing Rural Film Projection Stations
    To the Editor:
    Developing the people's drama and film industry is one of the cultural and educational policies of the People's Government. However, at present, our film projection work is still limited to large cities. In order to implement the policy of serving the people with art, it is indeed necessary to carry out this work in rural areas.
    Of course, given the current economic situation in our country, it is still difficult to widely carry out this work in rural areas. However, I believe that the government's cultural and educational departments should at least establish small film stations along the railway lines to tour and screen films, so that the vast number of farmers can enjoy artistic education.
                                                      Yang Ruixuan

　　扬瑞轩同志来信建议
    建立农村电影放映站编辑同志：
    发展人民的戏剧电影事业，是人民政府的文化教育政策之一。但目前我们的电影放映工作，还只限于大城市。为了贯彻艺术为人民服务的方针，这一工作实有在农村开展的必要。
    固然，根据当前我国的经济情况，这一工作在农村中广泛地开展还是有困难的。但我以为政府文教部门至少应在铁路沿线建立小型的电影站，巡回放映电影，使广大农民享受到艺术的教育。
