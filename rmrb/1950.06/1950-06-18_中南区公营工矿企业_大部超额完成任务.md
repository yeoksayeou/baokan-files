Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 17th. Most major publicly owned industrial and mining enterprises in the Central and South region exceeded their quotas in May. Among them, the tin production of the Pinggui Mining Bureau in Guangxi Province exceeded the planned target by 130 percent. Tungsten ore production in Hunan exceeded the target by 66 percent, and manganese ore production in Leping, Jiangxi, exceeded the production target by 85 percent. Other units, such as the automobile repair plant of the Henan Provincial Highway Transportation Company, the factory of the Hubei Provincial Mechanical Land Reclamation Office, and the Enan Power Company, also exceeded their May production plans. The above achievements are the result of the production competition launched by various factories and mines in May. In the early stages of the production competition movement, some units experienced problems such as simply pursuing figures, reducing quality, or affecting the health of workers due to excessive labor intensity. These shortcomings have been corrected after the attention of the higher authorities.

　　中南区公营工矿企业
    大部超额完成任务
    【新华社汉口十七日电】中南区各主要公营工矿企业五月份大部超额完成任务。其中广西省平桂矿务局的锡矿生产，超过预定计划达百分之一百三十。湖南钨矿生产超过任务百分之六十六，江西乐平锰矿超过生产任务百分之八十五。其他如河南省公路运输公司汽车修配厂、湖北省机械农垦处工厂、鄂南电力公司等单位，亦都超额完成了五月份生产计划。上述成绩是各厂矿在五月份开展生产竞赛的结果。若干单位在生产竞赛运动初期，曾发生单纯追求数字，质量降低，或因过分增强劳动强度而影响职工健康的现象。这些缺点经上级机关注意后已得到纠正。
