    Workers Rescue from Rain Risk, Warehouse Turns from Danger to Safety
    [Our Newspaper] Workers at the newly built Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory rescued a warehouse during a rainstorm, preventing the loss of state assets. On the afternoon of June 6th, the rain was pouring down. Workers from the Extraction Group suddenly discovered that the workshop door could not be closed. Upon closer inspection, it was found that the roof was sagging, creating a critical situation. After being informed, the administration instructed the factory's safety team to conduct a thorough inspection and telegraphed the Municipal Liquidation Bureau. The Liquidation Bureau immediately sent someone to investigate and found that the column on the lower floor was nearly half a foot broken off under pressure, and the column itself was slightly tilted. At this point, moving the items upstairs could reduce the pressure. The upstairs was a warehouse with many items. Relying solely on the warehouse comrades to move everything would have been difficult to complete in a short time. It happened to be the end of the workday, and the chairman of the trade union, Chen Dan, mobilized the workers to help move the items. Two hours later, all the materials in the warehouse had been moved out, avoiding an accident. That evening, the Liquidation Bureau sent people to the factory again to erect columns at the site of the incident, and the warehouse has turned from danger to safety.

    职工抢救雨险  仓房转危为安
    【本报讯】新建化学制药厂职工雨天抢救仓房，使国家资财免遭损失。六月六日下午，雨下得正紧。提制组工人忽然发现工房门关不住了。仔细一查，原是房顶下坠，危急万状。行政方面得讯后，一面责成本厂安全小组周密检查，一面电告市清管局。清管局随即派人前来查勘，发现楼下层的立柱底下被压折断有半尺许，柱身微倾。此时如能将楼上东西搬出，可减低压力。楼上是仓房，东西很多。仅凭仓库的同志搬运，一时很难搬完。这时正巧下工，工会主任陈丹遂发动工人帮助搬动。两小时后，仓库物资已全部搬出，避免了事故的发生。当晚，清管局又派人来厂在出事处架起了立柱，仓房已转危为安。
