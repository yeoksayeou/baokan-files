Gaoli State Farm Successfully Plants Rice in Dry Land

The Gaoli State Farm in the Bohai Reclamation Area has adopted a cultivation method of dry land drilling and post-irrigation for rice planting. As of May 25th, over 10,000 mu have been sown. The early sown crops have safely emerged, and the seedlings are lush and strong. In the Bohai area, planting rice in alkaline land without prior alkali leaching presents many technical difficulties. However, after repeated experiments and research by the farm's technical personnel, combined with advanced Soviet knowledge and the experience of nearby farmers, they have adopted a method of multiple irrigation and drainage immediately after mechanized sowing, which can also achieve the purpose of alkali leaching. This poses no problem for emergence and seedling growth, and has been initially proven in actual cultivation. (Speech)

　　高里国营农场旱地播稻成功
    渤海农垦区高里国营农场种稻，已改用旱地机播后灌水的栽培方法。截至五月二十五日已播完一万余亩，早播种的业已安全出苗，幼苗葱绿健旺。渤海区一带碱地种稻，不经过洗碱即行播种，在技术上困难甚多。但经该场技术人员多次试验研究，并结合苏联先进知识和附近农民的经验，采取了机播后，立即进行多次灌溉排水，亦可达到洗碱目的，对出苗及幼苗生长决无问题，在实际耕作上现已得到了初步证明。（语）
