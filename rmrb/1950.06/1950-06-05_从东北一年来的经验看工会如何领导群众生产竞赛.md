　　I. Achievements and Evaluation of Mass Production Competitions in the Northeast

　　The mass production competition in state-owned factories and mines in the Northeast over the past year can be divided into two stages, with the "New Record Creation Movement" in September 1949 as the dividing line. The first stage started with the protection and resumption of factories, went through the donation of materials, the "May 1st" mass production competition, and ended with the anti-waste campaign. During the May 1st mass production competition, the industrial construction of the Northeast achieved significant success. Coal mining exceeded the production target by 14%, and production efficiency increased from 0.28 tons to 0.35 tons. A coke oven and a blast furnace in Anshan successively resumed production, creating favorable conditions for national steel production. The machinery and a boiler of the Fushun plant, the largest thermal power plant in the Northeast that was destroyed by the Kuomintang, were also renovated. The central content of the second stage was the mass production competition to create new records. According to statistics from the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government, a total of 9,842 new records were created in 212 factories and mines. Among them, improved operating methods accounted for 14.8%, inventions accounted for 4.8%, and improved labor organization accounted for 0.16%. In the new record creation movement, rationalization proposals were launched, and the establishment of new labor attitudes was promoted, combined with improving technology and reforming management systems, which increased labor productivity. Compared with June 1949, labor productivity increased by 32.8% in December of the same year. At the same time, the quality of various products has also improved, and costs have also decreased. The new record movement has accumulated huge amounts of capital for the country, greatly accelerating the speed of industrial recovery and development in the Northeast. In the movement, more than 50,000 advanced production workers emerged. The organizational forms and work content of trade union organizations leading mass production competitions have also become richer than before. For example, collective contracts and contact contracts were signed in many factories, and production wage committees, workshop production meetings, advanced producer meetings, and group production meetings were gradually established, and production plans and production charts for groups, workshops, and individuals were formulated.

　　II. How do Trade Unions Organize and Lead Mass Production Competitions?

　　(1) It is necessary to first solve some ideological problems of trade union cadres.

　　For example, some trade union cadres in the Northeast have a one-sided welfare view, and they oppose protecting the interests of the working class with developing production. For example, before September last year, the trade union cadres of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory were busy opening pancake shops, issuing notes, stamping seals, borrowing money for employees, asking for leave, and fighting thieves. But the workers reflected: "The trade union is not working." Later, the trade union cadres established the idea of facing production, and in the mass production competition to create new records, labor productivity continued to increase; workers' welfare and cultural facilities were improved; and the income of bonus wages also greatly increased. At this time, the workers reflected: "The trade union is no longer a drag."

　　Some trade union cadres once had abstract political views and did not understand that developing production is the fundamental interest of the working class. Before September last year, some trade union cadres in the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory believed that some workers were "active in production but ideologically backward." This abstract political view that opposes production and ideology is wrong. Generally speaking, active production signifies ideological progress.

　　Some trade union cadres confuse labor protection safety and health equipment with employee benefits. Safety and health equipment are labor conditions, not employee benefits. It is the duty of trade union cadres to urge the administration to strengthen safety and health equipment and protect the safety of the working class's lives. For the necessary safety and health equipment, the administration should be supervised to solve it promptly and effectively.

　　(2) How to overcome the blindness of mass production competitions?

　　(1) The management policy of factories and mines must conform to the state's unified economic construction policy, and cannot be a blind production of each doing its own thing. For example, last year there was a surplus of matches and foreign wax on the Northeast market, and there was no production competition for these things.

　　(2) In order to complete and exceed the production plan stipulated by the state, it is necessary to mobilize the masses of workers to seriously and repeatedly discuss and formulate a production plan that can be completed when ordinary employees work actively and normally. The plan should not be set too low, trying to complete it easily, but it should not be set too high either. With a correct production plan, and then launch a mass production competition, this can avoid blindness and rushing.

　　(3) When launching a competition, it is necessary to propose clear competition goals based on the specific situation of the unit. When organizing and leading mass production competitions, it is necessary to exert great efforts to launch rationalization proposals. According to production needs, propose topics for rationalization proposals, mobilize employees to propose various rationalization proposals in a led and organized manner, and the Rationalization Proposal Committee will carefully study and submit them to the administration for review and approval. Take rationalization proposals as the main source of improving labor productivity, and take rationalization proposals as a regular, lasting, and important part of mass production competitions. At the same time, we must pay attention to opposing formalism in the competition and the tendency of short-term blind rushes.

　　(4) The trade union group is the organizational cell of the trade union. The success or failure of the group's work is directly related to the success or failure of the production competition. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the group. The characteristics of the Ma Hengchang group are to ensure quality, complete tasks ahead of schedule, and establish reasonable group work methods. Because the group established the first living inspection system, it avoided the large-scale production of waste products. The group also established a three-person mutual aid group, established a responsibility system and a shift handover system, held a 20-minute technical research meeting during the midday break, and carried out criticism and self-criticism. In the mass production competition, the Ma Hengchang group created the valuable experience that eight out of ten people in the group had no waste products throughout the year. The working methods and some systems of the Ma Hengchang group should be widely promoted.

　　(5) When launching a mass production competition, do not rush for quick results. It is best to gain good experience in one group or workshop first, and then universally promote it to the entire factory or mine, and even a region. Taking the competition as the lofty virtue of the working class to build a new China, and organizing technicians, management staff, and all employees into the competition by all means is the responsibility of the leadership. In the past, in mass production competitions, due to poor organization, some advanced elements stood outside the masses, making the production competition lose its mass character.

　　(6) There should not be too many competition conditions. Some individual trade union grassroots organizations in the Northeast have set more than 70 competition conditions, which is formalism in the competition. Generally speaking, on the premise of ensuring quality, ensuring technical quotas, and ensuring cost quotas, the amount of excess production tasks should be taken as the main criterion for evaluating competition results.

　　(7) The rewards for mass production competitions should basically be divided into two types: one is the rationalization proposal reward, and the other is the reward for exceeding the production task. Factories and mines that have implemented piece-rate and excess rewards can be implemented in accordance with the regulations on excess piece-rate wage rewards; in factories and mines that have not yet implemented piece-rate excess rewards, it is necessary to stipulate a certain amount of bonus. In addition to material rewards, a certain social honor reward should also be given. At the same time, the reward policy must implement the principle of more pay for more work and oppose egalitarianism. Rewards must be timely and must be proactive. Only red flag competitions, without material and spiritual rewards, cannot well consolidate the competitive enthusiasm of employees.

　　从东北一年来的经验看工会如何领导群众生产竞赛
    东北总工会生产部
    一、东北群众生产竞赛的成绩和估价
    东北国营厂矿一年来的群众生产竞赛，可以一九四九年九月的创造新纪录运动划分为前后两个阶段。第一阶段由护厂复工起，经过献纳器材、“五一”群众生产竞赛，到反浪费止。在五一群众生产竞赛中，东北工业建设获得了重要的成就。采煤超过生产任务的百分之十四，生产效率由○·二八吨达到○·三五吨。鞍山某炼焦炉与某鼓风炉相继复工生产，创造了全国钢铁生产的有利条件。被国民党破坏了的东北最大火力发电厂——抚顺厂的机器与某锅炉亦修建一新。第二阶段的中心内容是创造新纪录的群众生产竞赛。据东北人民政府工业部统计：二一二个工厂矿山，共创造新纪录九八四二件。其中，改进操作法的占百分之一四·八，创造发明占百分之四·八，改良劳动组织的占百分之○·一六。在创新纪录运动中，开展了合理化建议，提倡树立新的劳动态度，与提高技术，改革管理制度相结合，提高了劳动生产率。以一九四九年十二月与同年六月份作比，劳动生产率提高了百分之三二·八。同时，各种产品的质量也提高了，成本也降低了。新纪录运动为国家积累了巨量资金，大大加速了东北工业恢复与发展的速度。在运动中，涌现了五万多名先进生产工作者。工会组织领导群众生产竞赛的组织形式与工作内容，比较以前也丰富了。例如，在许多工厂签订了集体合同与联系合同，并逐渐建立了生产工资委员会、车间生产会议、先进生产者会议、小组生产会议，制订了小组、车间、个人的生产计划与生产图表。
    二、工会如何组织与领导群众生产竞赛？
    （一）必须先解决工会干部的一些思想问题。
    如东北某些工会干部有片面的福利观点，他们把保护工人阶级利益与发展生产对立起来。比如在去年九月份以前，沈阳机器三厂的工会干部忙于开煎饼铺，打条子，盖戳子，为职工借钱，请假，斗争小偷。但工人却反映：“工会不起作用。”以后，工会干部树立了面向生产的思想，在创造新纪录的群众生产竞赛中，劳动生产率不断提高；工人福利与文化设备得到了改善；奖励工资的收入也大大的增加了。这时，工人反映：“工会再不做尾巴了。”
    有些工会干部曾经存在着抽象的政治观点，不懂得发展生产是工人阶级的根本利益。去年九月以前，沈阳机器三厂有些工会干部，认为某些工人是“生产积极、思想落后”，这种把生产与思想对立起来的抽象的政治观点是不对的。一般地说，生产积极即标志着思想进步。
    有些工会干部把劳动保护的安全卫生设备与职工福利混为一谈。安全卫生设备是劳动条件，不是职工福利。督促行政加强安全卫生设备，保护工人阶级生命的安全，是工会干部的职责。对必须建立的安全卫生设备，应监督行政从速切实解决。
    （二）如何克服群众生产竞赛的盲目性？
    （１）工矿经营方针必须符合国家统一的经济建设方针，不能是各自为政的盲目生产。如去年东北市场上火柴及洋腊过剩，对于这些东西，就没有竞赛生产。
    （２）为了完成与超过国家规定的生产计划，必须发动工人群众，认真地反复地讨论，制订一般职工积极努力，正常工作时能完成的生产计划。计划不应订的过低，企图轻而易举的来完成，但也不能订的过高。有了正确的生产计划，再来发动群众生产竞赛，这样就可以避免盲目性和突击性。
    （３）发动竞赛时，要根据本单位的具体情况提出明确的竞赛目标。在组织与领导群众生产竞赛时，必需以极大的力量来开展合理化建议。根据生产的需要，提出合理化建议的课题，有领导有组织地发动职工群众提出各方面的合理化建议，由合理化建议委员会慎重研究，提交行政审查批准。把合理化建议作为提高劳动生产率的主要泉源，把合理化建议作为经常的、持久的、群众生产竞赛的重要内容。同时要注意反对竞赛中的形式主义，短期盲目突击的偏向。
    （４）工会小组是工会的组织细胞，小组工作好坏，与生产竞赛的成败有直接关系。因此，要加强小组的领导。马恒昌小组的特点是保证质量、提前完成任务，建立合理的小组工作方法。该组由于建立了第一个活的检查制，避免了废活的大量产生。该组还成立了三人互助小组，建立责任制与交接班制，召开午间休息时二十分钟技术研究会，开展批评与自我批评等。在群众生产竞赛中，马恒昌小组创造了全年全组十人有八人没出废品的宝贵经验。马恒昌小组的工作方法和一些制度应该普遍推行。
    （５）开展群众生产竞赛时，不可操之过急。最好先在一个小组或车间取得良好经验，再普遍推广到整个厂矿，以至一个地区。把竞赛当作工人阶级建设新中国的崇高美德，用一切方法将技术管理人员和一切职工组织到竞赛中来，这是领导上的责任。过去在群众性生产竞赛中，由于组织得不够好，某些先进分子站在群众之外，使生产竞赛失掉了群众性。
    （６）竞赛条件不应该订的过多，东北有个别的工会基层组织，曾订了七十多条竞赛条件，这是竞赛中的形式主义。一般的说，在保证质量、保证技术定额、保证成本定额的条件下，应以超过生产任务多少，作为评定竞赛成绩的主要准则。
    （７）对于群众生产竞赛的奖励，基本上应分为两种：一种是合理化建议奖励，一种是超过生产任务奖励。已实行计件与超额奖励的工矿，可按超额计件工资奖励办法规定执行；在尚未实行计件超额奖励的工矿，则需规定一定数额的奖励金。除了物质奖励，还应给予一定的社会荣誉奖励。同时奖励政策必须贯彻多劳多得的原则，反对平均主义。奖励必须及时，必须主动。只有红旗竞赛，没有物质上和精神上的奖励，是不能很好巩固职工群众竞赛情绪的。
