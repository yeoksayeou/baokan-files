　　Glory of the Anci County Labor Team
    Completion of the Beijing-Tianjin Levee Results in a Large Number of Model Workers
    In the process of constructing the Beijing-Tianjin road protection levee (i.e., the Longhe South Levee), Anci County produced two model ramming villages, four model earthwork villages, and two hundred and twenty-one model levee workers, and received commendations from the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Office. The Shigezhuang ramming team of the Seventh District labor team, rammed for thirty days, often lifting a four-hundred-jin roller [translator's note: a jin is approximately 1.1 pounds] overhead. Moreover, the ramming pits were dense, and they were linked together (levees built in this way are more solid). One morning it rained, and other villages wanted to stop work, but they said, "It doesn't matter, let's persevere for a while longer, it won't be too late to leave when the rain gets heavier." Their spirit of friendship and mutual assistance was also very good, and they could often help the earthworkers carry soil. The levee workers of Zhongsuo Village in the Fourth District participated in levee construction twice, and both times they were able to build up and fill the levee according to the specified thickness, and they were able to complete the work ahead of schedule, so they were both selected as models. The laborers of Zhongsuo Village and Shigezhuang Village also had a very good relationship with their landlords, often carrying water and sweeping the yard for them. Cadres being actively responsible for the levee construction work and providing good leadership is also a major characteristic of the county's labor teams. Comrade Zhang Maode, secretary of the Communist Party branch in Nanbei Chen Village, was particularly concerned about the laborers. He often convened meetings of the laborers to understand their situation and solve their difficulties. Every night, after the laborers had fallen asleep, he would go to each room to check whether they were covered with quilts; if they were not, he would cover them. In the morning, he would fill the water tanks and sweep the yard before calling the laborers to get up. Once, he went home on official business and learned that the family of a laborer named Wu had nothing to eat, so he lent her one sheng of his own river worker's grain [translator's note: a sheng is a dry volume measure]. When the laborers heard this news, they worked even more actively. Guo Wanzhong, the captain of the Eighth District labor team, and instructor Liu Xitai (both district cadres) were conscientious and responsible in their work during the levee construction. They often stayed on the construction site, lived with the laborers, cared about their difficulties, and encouraged their morale, ensuring the quality of the project and completing the levee construction task on time. Therefore, the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Office awarded Anci County's model laborers six prize banners, ninety glorious flowers, two hundred and fifty towels, three hundred straw hats, and also issued certificates of merit.

　　安次县民工队的光荣
    修竣京津护路堤涌现大批模范
    在修筑京津路护路大堤（即龙河南堤）的过程中，安次县涌现了两个模范夯工村，四个模范土工村和二百二十一名模范堤工，获得了华北水利工程处的嘉奖。七区民工队石各庄夯工，打夯三十天，经常抬四百斤重轮?（代夯）过顶。而且夯窝密，又是连环套着打的（这样打成的堤比较坚固）。有一天早晨下雨，别村要收工，他们说：“不要紧，再坚持一会吧，等下大了再走也不晚。”他们的友爱互助精神也很好，能经常帮助土工提土。四区中所村堤工，参加修堤两次，都能按照规定的厚度培堤垫土，并能提前完工，所以两次都当了模范。中所村、石各庄村的民工，和房东的关系也搞的很好，经常给房东担水扫院子。干部对修堤工作积极负责，领导的好，也是该县民工队的一大特点。南北陈村中共支部书记张茂德同志对民工特别关心。他经常召集民工开会，了解民工的情况，解决民工的困难。每天晚上等民工睡了以后，他到各房检查民工们盖上了被子没有；没盖的，就给盖上。早晨，他挑满水缸，扫完院子后，才叫民工起床。有一次他为公事回家去了一趟，知道了一个姓吴的民工家属没有吃的，他就把自己领的河工粮借一升给了她。民工们听到这消息，工作更积极了。八区民工大队长国万忠，教导员刘锡泰（都是区干部）在修堤中，工作认真负责，经常不离工地，和民工生活在一起，关心民工的困难，鼓励民工情绪，保证了工程质量，按时完成了修堤任务。因此，华北水利工程处奖给安次县模范民工六面奖旗，九十朵光荣花，二百五十条毛巾，三百个草帽，还发了奖状。
