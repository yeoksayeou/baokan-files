Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: Speech by Liang Juwu, a Miao democratic personage, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The full text is as follows:

Chairman, esteemed members, comrades:

For many years, the Miao people have lived under the oppression of the ruling class, especially during the period of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, leading extremely painful lives. We could only provide money and grain, do hard labor, and be slaves to others. Our economic and cultural development was hindered, and our right to participate in national affairs was restricted.

But now it's different. Our Miao people have also been liberated along with the liberation of other fraternal ethnic groups. We can only completely thank the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for our liberation today, and thank the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army for freeing us from the oppression of reactionary rule. We are willing to follow the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao forever. Only by following the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can our suffering be relieved, our lives improved, our lives and property safely protected, and our culture and political future be guaranteed to be bright.

When the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held last year, Miao representatives participated. This time, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I was invited to attend as a Miao representative. I listened to Chairman Mao's opening remarks, as well as the reports of Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi and other government leaders. I also participated in group meetings and plenary discussions together with advanced Party and government officials and patriotic democratic figures from various regions. This is an extremely glorious event for our Miao people. Therefore, on behalf of the Miao people, I express my firm support for the resolutions of the Second Session of the National Committee, especially the resolution on land reform. I am willing to earnestly convey this message after returning to my region so that our Miao people can understand the importance of land reform. Some provinces and regions have decided to implement this law starting this year, while others have decided to implement it starting next year. The implementation period in areas where ethnic minorities live will be extended a bit. This is the Central People's Government's care for ethnic minorities, giving them more opportunity to prepare. When everyone consciously recognizes the necessity of implementing land reform, the People's Government will definitely help ethnic minorities to thoroughly implement it. Therefore, our Miao people completely agree with this approach.

Now, on behalf of the Miao people, in addition to expressing my complete support for the Land Reform Law, I would like to make a few suggestions:

One, develop transportation in Miao areas, facilitate the trade of Miao local products, and gradually improve the lives of the Miao people.

Two, establish Miao schools extensively, develop the Miao language, and improve the cultural standards of the Miao people.

Three, select promising Miao youth and send them to ethnic education institutions sponsored by the central government to cultivate Miao revolutionary cadres to participate in the construction of New China.

Four, establish hospitals in Miao areas and promote health care for the Miao people.

Five, in areas of Miao regions where land reform conditions are in place, please implement land reform early as a demonstration.

Finally, I shout the slogans:

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live the unity of all fraternal ethnic groups!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　特邀列席苗族民主人士
    梁聚五的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】苗族民主人士梁聚五在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言。全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    苗族人民，多少年来，都在统治阶级的压迫下，尤其是在蒋介石反动统治的时期，过着极痛苦的生活。我们只有出钱出粮、做苦工、做别人的奴隶。妨害我们经济文化的发展，限制我们参与国家大事的权利。
    现在可不同了，我们苗族人民也随着其他兄弟民族的解放而解放了。我们能够得到今天的解放，这要完全感谢中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，感谢人民解放军的英勇作战，使我们脱离了反动统治的压迫。我们愿永远的跟着中国共产党走，跟着毛主席走，我们也惟有跟着中国共产党走，跟着毛主席走，我们的苦痛才会解除，我们的生活才会改善，我们的生命财产才会得到安全的保障，我们的文化和我们的政治前途，才会得到光明的保证。
    去年召开中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议的时候，曾有苗族代表参加，此次中国人民政协第一届全国委员会召开第二次会议，我又以苗族身份被邀列席，聆听了毛主席的开会词，以及刘少奇副主席和其他政府首长的报告，并且与党政先进、各地爱国民主人士共同参加了小组会议，参加了大会讨论，这是我们苗族一件极光荣的事。所以我代表苗族人民，对于全国委员会第二次会议的决议案，尤其是关于土地改革的决议案，表示坚决的拥护，并愿回到地方以后，认真的传达，使我们苗族人民，都能了解土地改革的重要。这法案的推行，有些省区决定从今年开始，有些省区决定从明年开始。少数民族聚居的区域，推行期间是要延缓一点，这是中央人民政府爱护少数民族，让少数民族多有一点准备的机会。到了大家都有自觉的认识到土地改革实施的必要时，人民政府一定会帮助少数民族去彻底执行的。所以我们苗族完全同意这种办法。
    现在我代表苗族人民，对于土地改革法案，除表示完全拥护以外，还要提出几点建议：
    一、发展苗区交通，便利苗族土产交易，使苗民的生活逐渐改善。
    二、普设苗民学校，发展苗民语言文字，以提高苗民文化水准。
    三、选拔苗民有为青年，入中央主办之民族教育机关，培养苗族革命干部，以参加新中国的建设。
    四、在苗区设立医院，推广苗族的卫生保健事业。
    五、在苗区具备土地改革条件的地方，请提早实行土改，以作示范。
    最后我高呼口号：
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    各兄弟民族团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
