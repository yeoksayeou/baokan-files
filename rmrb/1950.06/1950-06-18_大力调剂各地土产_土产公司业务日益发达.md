    Vigorously Adjusting Local Products from Various Regions
    Native Produce Company's Business Flourishes

    [Our Newspaper's Report] Since the National Native Produce Conference in early May, the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Native Produce Company has changed its past focus on mere purchasing and has established a business policy of adjusting native products from various regions, actively promoting sales. Within a month, it sold a total of 740 million yuan worth of products from various regions and purchased a total of 960 million yuan worth of Beijing native products. It has made considerable achievements in supporting Beijing's native product manufacturers, developing rural sideline occupations in various regions, and reducing industrial production costs.

    In early May, the company established wholesale departments in Xidan and Qianmenwai, establishing normal business relationships with department stores, retail companies, and private merchants, and maintaining regular contact with various factories to supply raw materials, vigorously opening up sales channels for native products. In May, the company directly managed and acted as an agent for the sale of the following rural sideline products and industrial raw materials from various regions: 42,840 catties of Northeast lard, 11,552 Zhejiang cool mats, 30,062 catties of Zhangjiakou black melon seeds, 52,470 catties of sunflower seeds, 174 catties of Northeast Yuanmo, and 1,634 catties of Henan wood ear. Native products from various regions needed by Beijing, such as bamboo products, umbrellas, white hemp, pepper, sea cucumber, pickled mustard tuber, oranges, dried persimmons, and black dates, have all begun to be allocated or are preparing to be allocated when the season arrives. For the beef tallow needed by the soap industry, allocations have been made from the Northwest, Kaifeng, and Xuzhou, with a monthly supply of 50,000 catties. For the alum needed by the paper industry, allocations have been made from Wenzhou, with a monthly supply of 15 tons. In addition, industrial raw materials such as Guangdong rosin, Yingcheng and Taiyuan gypsum, Pianguan sulfur, Tangshan red alkali, and Hangu bittern have all been allocated from various regions, with monthly supply quantities all around 50,000 catties.

    In terms of purchasing Beijing native products, due to seasonal factors, only 88,439 catties of vermicelli that were滞销 (were slow moving) in the market were purchased in May. This purchase by the company directly supported 111 large and small vermicelli factories in the city. The company has now sent personnel to Guangzhou to promote sales. The company is also preparing to purchase 100,000 catties of each type of peach kernels and apricot kernels when they come on the market in September and October. Furthermore, in order to appropriately take into account the legitimate profits of private merchants, it has sent a letter to the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, convening various industries in the city that operate in Northern and Southern native products to jointly formulate a year-round sales plan for Beijing with the company. The company will uniformly allocate and wholesale to private merchants for sale according to the plan, and maintain an appropriate difference between wholesale and retail prices. For Beijing native product finished products or raw materials that have sales channels at home and abroad, if private merchants are unable to operate on a large scale or if滞销 (slow sales) cause prices to be too low and affect producers, the company will find ways to purchase them.

　　大力调剂各地土产
    土产公司业务日益发达
    【本报讯】中国土产公司北京市公司，自五月上旬全国土产会议后，改变了过去单纯收购，确定以调剂各地土产为业务方针，积极推销土产。一个月内计销出各地产品总值七亿四千万元，收购北京土产总值九亿六千万元。在扶持京市土产厂家，发展各地农村副业及减低工业生产成本方面，做出了相当成绩。
    五月初，该公司在西单及前门外设立批发部，与百货、零售公司及私商建立了正常业务关系，并与各工厂经常联系，供给原料，大力打开土产销路。五月份，该公司直接经营及代销出的各地农村副产品及工业原料计：东北猪油四二、八四○斤，浙江凉席一一、五五二条，张家口黑瓜子三○、○六二斤，葵花子五二、四七○斤，东北元磨一七四斤，河南木耳一、六三四斤。京市所需各地土产如竹货、雨伞、白麻、胡椒、海参、榨菜、橘子、柿饼、黑枣等，均已开始或准备到季节时调拨。肥皂业所需之牛油，已向西北、开封、徐州调拨，每月可供应五万斤。造纸业所需之明矾，已向温州调拨，每月十五吨。此外广东松香、应城及太原石膏、偏关硫磺、唐山赤?、汉沽盐卤等工业原料，均已向各地调拨，每月供应数量均在五万斤上下。
    收购北京土产方面，因季节关系，五月份仅收购市场滞销的粉丝八八、四三九斤。该公司此次收购，直接扶持了本市大小粉丝厂一百零一家。现该公司已派员携货赴广州推销。该公司并准备在九、十月桃仁、杏仁上市后，每种收购十万斤。又因适当照顾私商的合法利润，已函请市工商联合会，召集本市经营南北土产的各行业与该公司共同制订京市全年销售计划。由该公司依计划统一调拨，批发给各私商出售，并保持批发价与零售价间有适当差额。对在国内外有销路之京市土产成品或原料，私商无力大量经营或因滞销价格过低影响生产者，该公司将设法收购。
