“Welfare State” or War State?
    ——The United States Under Truman
    Zhao Yihe
    Truman's "brain trust" manufactured many high-sounding new terms after Truman's re-election as president in 1948.

    First, they created the slogan of "Fair Deal." According to the Truman group and its journalistic pawns, this was to ensure that all classes and strata would not suffer losses, so as to achieve the consolidation and prosperity of the American economy. They also said that the various bills that Truman requested Congress to pass, such as the "National Housing Act," "Minimum Wage Law," and "Rent Control Law," were aimed at realizing a "welfare state" for the people.

    However, due to the control of speech by the reactionary ruling class in the United States, the average American heard Truman touting his own set of methods to the skies on the one hand, and saw the notoriously Republican newspapers trying to put the hat of "socialism" on Truman's head all day long on the other. Over time, some of the more backward people were fooled and really thought that Truman was working for the benefit of the masses.

    In fact, this cross-talk performance by the Democratic and Republican parties is very easy for us to see through.

    The hypocrisy of the "welfare state" slogan can be fully proved by one fact: at the end of 1948, after Truman was elected president and "returned in glory" to Washington from his hometown of Missouri, the first thing he did was to invite the heads of major companies to talk. He told those big bosses that they "need not be afraid" of his actions in the future. This was to tell them: Although I shouted during the election that I would greatly increase corporate taxes and use the tax revenue for such and such "welfare facilities," I will have a sense of propriety in the future, and I will not let you suffer. This matter was widely published in American newspapers.

    Since there was already an understanding between master and servant, then letting Truman scold the big capitalists while promoting his "Fair Deal" and "Welfare State," and letting the big capitalists in turn accuse him of being a "socialist," was not only harmless, but could also make this drama of deceiving the people more realistic.

    Coincidentally, the pronunciations of "Welfare State" and "Warfare State" are extremely similar in English. The progressive party's newspaper *Daily Worker* often used the latter to replace the former in its headlines, which is a correct statement.

    War state - that is the entire content of the "welfare state."

    We only need to look at the income and expenditure statements recently released by the U.S. government to know the truth about the "welfare state."

    In the 1948-1949 fiscal year, the total revenue of the U.S. federal government was more than $42.017 billion, and the total expenditure was more than $37.057 billion. The expenditure listed under "National Military Facilities" was more than $15.6922 billion, accounting for more than one-third of the total expenditure. In addition, the expenditure under the Atomic Energy Commission, which manufactures murderous weapons, was more than $647 million.

    However, these are only the direct costs spent on preparing for a "hot war." The cost of the "cold war" in preparation for a "hot war" must also be taken into account. On April 2, 1948, Congress passed $6.098 billion for the purpose of aiding the reactionary governments of Europe and Asia. The period of allocation of this sum roughly coincided with the 1948-1949 fiscal year. In addition, the administrative expenses of the "Economic Cooperation Administration" that allocated this money in the same year were more than $1.174498 billion.

    The sum of these expenditures is more than $23.61218 billion. If the above-mentioned total expenditure of more than $37 billion is added to the Marshall Plan appropriation not listed under administrative expenses, the total expenditure is more than $43.10155 billion. In this way, the direct expenditure of the American reactionary government in conducting the "cold war" and preparing for the "hot war" in the same year accounted for more than 54 percent of the total expenditure.

    Recent news reports say that the U.S. government's military expenditure for the 1949-50 fiscal year has actually reached 68 percent of its total expenditure, and will increase to 76 percent next year. This is inevitable. However, since the U.S. official has not yet announced the income and expenditure statements for the 1949-1950 fiscal year, we will temporarily calculate how the American people were forced to shoulder the burden of war preparation a year ago based on the figures for the 1948-49 fiscal year.

    For several years, it has been estimated that the number of employed people in the United States is 60 million. But we can assert that this figure is long outdated. At the beginning of 1949, the number of unemployed people admitted by the U.S. government exceeded 3 million, and the number of other undeclared unemployed and semi-unemployed people is unknown. Therefore, we will count the number of fully unemployed people at that time as 5 million, which is the lowest estimate. We will count the number of employed people at that time as 55 million, which is the highest estimate.

    According to the total income tax revenue of more than $29.982283 billion in the 1948-49 fiscal year announced by the U.S. Treasury Department, this means that 55 million employed Americans paid an average of $545 in tax in the same year.

    As mentioned above, 54 percent of the U.S. government's expenditure in the same year was directly used for war preparation. This means that of the $545 that each employed American paid on average in the same year, $314.30 was directly used for war preparation.

    It must be stated that the above are only extremely conservative, minimum calculations. We should not only see the huge "corporate tax" revenue listed on the U.S. government's financial revenue and expenditure statement and think that capitalists also paid a lot of taxes. The burden of corporate tax is bound to be passed on to consumers by capitalists. It is not an exaggeration to say that the American reactionary government's war preparation expenses come directly and indirectly entirely from the broad working people.

    Although we cannot finally provide accurate calculations for the situation in the current year and next year, judging from the two facts of increased military expenditure and increased unemployment alone, it is entirely possible that the burden of war preparation for American taxpayers will be double the amount of the 1948-49 fiscal year.

    This is the war state under the rule of Truman and his masters - the American big bourgeoisie.

    What kind of "welfare" did the hypocritical Truman seek for the American people?

    In his message to Congress at the beginning of this year, he openly admitted: "It is estimated that one-third of (American) families are unable to make ends meet." The number of fully unemployed people admitted by the U.S. government is about to exceed the 5 million mark. In fact, the number of fully unemployed and partially unemployed people reaches 18 million.

    What solutions did Truman come up with for these families who could not make ends meet and the unemployed?

    During the election, Truman pushed the responsibility for formulating all reactionary measures onto the Republican-controlled Eightieth Congress. Now the "achievements" of the Eighty-first Congress, in which the Democratic Party holds the majority, are all in front of us. Truman's and the Democratic Party's loyalty to the "Taft-Hartley Anti-Labor Act" is well known. It is true that Truman once said that he would abolish the anti-labor law, but when those Democratic colleagues in Congress were still "trying to figure out what the president meant" to see if the president really wanted to abolish it, Truman had already announced that the proposal was over.

    It is easy to understand the truth of the "welfare measures" by looking at the Congressional record. From Truman's re-election as president to the present, there were only 15 bills of this kind originally proposed in Congress, and only seven were passed. These seven are either treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it aches for a dying capitalism, or using a very small amount of money from the budget to hold "welfare" to deceive the people.

    For example, the bill to maintain agricultural product prices is a helpless way to save the crisis of capitalist agriculture. The government uses taxpayers' money to purchase large quantities of surplus agricultural products, so that their prices will not fall too tragically.

    Civil servants got a raise. Truman's own expenses doubled, and senior officials also got a lot, but tens of thousands of low-level civil servants only increased by dozens of dollars per year on average. The statutory minimum wage increased from 40 cents to 75 cents per hour. Who doesn't know the purchasing power of 75 cents today? The federal government continues to restrict rent, but also says that state governments have the right to cancel price limits. Which landlord would stay put without raising prices? How much money has the federal government allocated to build houses for the people, repair roads and bridges, and open some "non-profit" hospitals? The three things combined are only 508 million a year, accounting for 1.2 percent of the total expenditure!

    The "Seven Great Virtues" of the Eighty-first Congress, which are also Truman's, are all here. Among the bills that were not passed, one was about expanding the scope of those receiving pensions, one was about abolishing the poll tax, and another was a bill proposing that the federal government subsidize various educational institutions with 300 million U.S. dollars each year.

    This shows that the reactionary government has extracted a large amount of money from the people and is engaged in preparations to realize its dream of dominating the world; even when it uses a very small part of this money to deceive the people, it is very stingy.

    Isn't it clear what kind of evaluation the American people can make of such a "welfare state"?

### “福利国家”抑是战争国家？——杜鲁门统治下的美国

　　“福利国家”抑是战争国家？
    ——杜鲁门统治下的美国
    赵一鹤
    杜鲁门的“智囊”们，在一九四八年杜鲁门联任总统以后，就制造了不少官冕堂皇的新名词。
    首先，他们创“公平政策”的口号。据杜鲁门集团和其在报界的爪牙解释，这是要使各阶级各阶层彼此不吃亏，达到美国经济的巩固与繁荣。他们又说：杜鲁门所要求国会通过的种种法案、如“全国建屋法”、“最低工资法”及“房租管制法”等等，旨在实现一个为人民的“福利国家”。
    但是，由于美国反动统治阶级对言论的控制，一般美国人一方面听见杜鲁门将自己的一套办法吹得天花乱坠；另一方面，又看见向来声名狼籍的共和党报纸，成天要将“社会主义”的帽子加在杜鲁门头上。久而久之，有一些较为落后的，便上了当，真以为杜鲁门是在为人民大众谋福利了。
    其实，民主共和两党的这一场对口相声，在我们是极易识破的。
    “福利国家”这个口号的虚伪性，首先可以从一件事实中得到充分的证明：一九四八年底，杜鲁门当选了总统，从米苏里故乡“荣归”华盛顿后所作的第一件事，就是邀集各大公司的负责人谈话。他告诉那些大老板说：今后他们对他的所作所为，“不必害怕”。这就是向他们打招呼道：尽管我在竞选时嚷着要大大增加公司税，将税收用在这样那样“福利设施”上，以后做起来自有分寸，不会让你们吃亏的。这件事，是经美国报纸普遍登载过的。
    既然主奴之间早有谅解，那么，让杜鲁门在宣传其“公平政策”与“福利国家”时骂骂大资本家，让大资本家反过来指他为“社会主义者”，不但无害，而且可以使这场愚弄人民的戏更形逼真了。
    凑巧，“福利国家”（“Welfare state”）和战争国家（Warfare state）这两个名词，在英文中的发音极其相近。进步党机关报《民族保卫者》的标题中，往往以后者代前者，这是正确的说法。
    战争国家——这就是“福利国家”的全部内容。
    我们只要看一看美国政府近来所公布的收支结算，便知“福利国家”的真相。
    一九四八——一九四九财政年度中，美国联邦政府的总收入为四百二十亿一千七百余万美元，总支出为三百七十亿五千七百余万美元。列于“国家军事设施”项下的支出，是一百五十六亿九千二百二十余万美元，占总支出的三分之一强。此外，制造杀人凶器的原子能委员会项下的支出，是六亿四千七百余万美元。
    但是，这仅仅是准备“热战”所花的直接费用。作为“热战”准备的“冷战”费用，也不能不计算在内。一九四八年四月二日，国会通过以六十亿九千八百万，作为援助欧亚反动政府之用。这笔款子分配的时期，大致与一九四八——一九四九财政年度相符。此外，分配这笔钱的“经济合作总署”同年度的行政费用，是十一亿七千四百九十八万余美元。
    这几项支出的总和，是二百三十六亿一千二百十八万余美元。如将上述三百七十亿余总开支，加上未列于行政开支项下的马歇尔计划拨款，则总支出是四百三十一亿一百五十五万余美元。这样，同年美国反动政府在进行“冷战”和准备“热战”上的直接支出，占了全部支出的百分之五十四强。
    最近的新闻报道说，美国政府一九四九——五零年度的军费，实已达其总支出的百分之六十八，明年度将增到百分之七十六。这是必然的。但由于美国官方尚未公布一九四九——一九五零年度的收支结算，我们姑且根据一九四八——四九年度的数字，来计算美国人民在一年前已是怎样地被迫肩负着备战的负担。
    若干年来，人们估计美国的就业人数为六千万。但我们可以断言，这个数字早就过时了。一九四九年年初，美国政府所承认的失业人数就超过了三百万，其他未宣布的失业和半失业的人数则不知究为若干。因此，我们将当时的完全失业人数作五百万计，是最低的估计。我们将当时的就业人数作五千五百万计，是最高的估计。
    根据美国财政部所公布的，一九四八——四九年度所得税的总收入是二百九十九亿八千二百二十八万三千余美元。这就是说，五千五百万就业的美国人，平均每人在同年度负担了五百四十五元的税。
    如上所说，同年度美国政府的支出有百分之五十四直接用在备战上面。这就是说，每一个有职业的美国人同年所平均负担的五百四十五元中，有三百十四元三角被直接用于战争的准备上。
    必须说明：以上这些，仅仅是极其保守的，最低限度的计算。我们不要只看见美国政府财政收支表上列着巨额的“公司税”收入，便以为资本家也纳了不少税。公司税的负担，是必然被资本家转嫁在消费者的身上的。如果说美国反动政府的备战费用，直接间接全部来自广大的劳动人民身上，是一点也不过分的。
    虽然我们对于本年度和明年度的情况，还不能最后提供精确的计算，但单就军费增加、失业增加这两个事实看来，美国纳税者对于备战的负担，将倍于一九四八——四九年度的数目，是完全可能的。
    这就是杜鲁门和他的主子——美国大资产阶级——统治下的战争国家。
    欺世盗名的杜鲁门替美国人民谋了些什么“福利”呢？
    他在本年年初致国会的咨文中公开承认：“据估计，（美国）有三分之一的家庭是入不敷出的。”美国政府所承认的完全失业人数，看着就要突出五百万的大关了。实际上完全失业及部分失业的人数，达一千八百万人。
    杜鲁门替这些入不敷出的家庭和失业者想了些什么办法呢？
    杜鲁门竞选时将制定一切反动措施的责任推在共和党所控制的第八十届国会身上。如今以民主党占多数的第八十一届国会的“成绩”，都摆在眼前了。杜鲁门及民主党对于“塔虎特——哈特莱反劳工法”之忠诚，是尽人皆知的。不错，杜鲁门曾说过他要取消反劳工法，但当他在国会中的那些民主党同僚还在“揣摩上意”，看看总统先生是否真的要废除它时，杜鲁门就已宣布此议作罢了。
    翻国会记录便容易明白“福利措施”的真相。从杜鲁门连任总统到最近为止，属于这一类的法案在国会中提出的，本来就只有十五件，通过的只有七件。这七件不是替危亡的资本主义头痛医头脚痛医脚，就是，以占预算极小的一笔款子来举办“福利”以哄骗人民。
    例如，维持农产品价格的法案，就是解救资本主义农业危机的无办法中的办法。政府用纳税者的钱大量购买剩余农产品，借使其价格不致跌得太惨。
    公务员加薪了。杜鲁门自己的费用加了一倍，高级官吏所得也不少，成千成万的低级公务员却平均每人只年增数十元。法定的最低工资由每小时四角增到七角五分。谁不知道七角五分钱在今天的购买力？联邦政府继续限制房租，但又说各州政府有权取消限价，那一个房东会呆着不涨价？联邦政府要替人民造房子，补路修桥，还要开设些“不以营利为目的”的医院，拨出了多少钱？三件事合起来一年才五亿零八百万，占总开支的百分之一点二！
    八十一届国会的，也就是杜鲁门的“七大德政”都在这里了。未通过的法案中，一件是关于扩大领取养老金者的范围的，一件是取消人头税的，另一件就是提议由联邦政府每年以三亿美元资助各教育机关的法案。
    这说明了：反动政府从人民身上榨取了大量金钱，从事于实现独霸世界的梦想的准备；即使以这笔钱的极小部分来哄骗人民时，也是很吝啬的。
    对于这样的“福利国家”，美国人民能作什么样的估价，还不清楚吗？
