Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 28th: According to a report from the Electric News Agency in Rome on June 27th, in response to the current Korean situation, the Secretariat of the Italian National Peace Committee held an emergency meeting on the night of the 26th to discuss how to mobilize the power of Italian peace advocates to resist the "crisis of war." The National Peace Committee has announced that it will hold an emergency meeting in Rome on the 28th, and representatives from the peace committees of various provinces will attend.

During its meeting on the 26th, the Secretariat of the National Peace Committee paid special attention to the fact that the US military is engaging in armed intervention in Korea. The Secretariat of the National Peace Committee issued a communique on the 27th, stating: "This action by the US military indicates that they are substituting themselves for qualified international organizations and risking the expansion of the war."

The Secretariat's communique warned public opinion to be vigilant against the notorious, well-known reactionary newspapers and news agencies' shameless conspiracies of distorting facts and confusing right and wrong in reporting Korean news. At the same time, it called on local peace committees to expand and strengthen the signature campaign for the peace declaration demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, and stated: "The current events have made this movement more urgent and necessary, and therefore we must be more enthusiastic."

The Italian Communist Party's "L'Unità" declared on the 27th: "The imperialists' current aggressive actions in Korea, in fact, prove that in order to save the world from a third world war, it is necessary to strengthen and expand the peace front. While the heroic Korean people are defending their national independence, let the peaceful voices of our people be stronger and resound throughout Italy!"
