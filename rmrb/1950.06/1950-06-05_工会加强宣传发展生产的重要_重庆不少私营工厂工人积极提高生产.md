　　Xinhua News Agency, 1st [of June]. Chongqing: Trade unions in Chongqing's private factories are focusing on production, and production in some private factories has improved. At the beginning of the city's liberation, workers in private factories did not understand that developing production was in the best interests of the working class, and could not understand the policy of "developing production, mutual benefit for labor and capital." Their enthusiasm for production was generally low. Some workers even thought that after liberation everything was free, and they were no longer oppressed. As a result, labor discipline was lax, and they stopped work and vehicles at will, danced the "Yangge" during production time, and excessively demanded wage increases and improved welfare.

　　In February of this year, the expanded meeting of the Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee reviewed this abnormal situation and proposed that trade union work in all public and private factories must be production-oriented. In some private factories, trade union workers widely publicized this correct policy, and workers gradually recognized the importance of doing a good job in production. With the trade union's specific organization and leadership of production work, production in March and April has significantly improved. Before liberation, the private Shashi Yarn Factory averaged 29 pieces of yarn per day. In the early days of liberation, the daily output of yarn had dropped to 23 pieces. In March, the average daily output of yarn was raised to 30.15 pieces, and in April, the daily output of yarn further increased to 31.25 pieces. At the same time, the capitalists also agreed to abolish the body search system and some old and unreasonable management systems, and appropriately improved the food, which further increased the enthusiasm of workers for production. After explaining the significance of being production-oriented to the workers, the trade union of the private Daming Yarn Factory held a meeting of employee representatives to mobilize workers to discuss production issues. As a result, workers understood the importance of doing a good job in production and actively carried out production. The factory's cloth output in March reached 860 bolts, exceeding the pre-liberation monthly output by 128 bolts, and the amount of yarn produced also increased by more than 10 percent compared with the highest monthly output before liberation. Some workers even spun 42 spindles of yarn in 9 and a half hours, breaking the factory's historical record. The factory owner also agreed to abolish the body search system and improve some of the welfare undertakings for employees. After the workers clearly recognized the importance of doing a good job in production, and on the condition that the capitalists agreed to abolish the feudal headman system and implement piece-rate wages, the coal output of several pits in the private Tianfu Coal Mine in the first ten days of March increased from 95 tons per shift in mid-February to 301 tons per shift. The workers of the factory are in high spirits for production.

### 工会加强宣传发展生产的重要  重庆不少私营工厂工人积极提高生产

　　工会加强宣传发展生产的重要
    重庆不少私营工厂工人积极提高生产
    【新华社一日讯】重庆市私营工厂工会面向生产，部分私营工厂生产已获提高。该市解放之初，私营工厂工人由于不了解发展生产是工人阶级最大的利益，对“发展生产、劳资两利”的方针想不通，生产积极性普遍不高。有些工人甚至以为解放后一切都自由了，不受压迫了，因而劳动纪律松弛，随便停工停车，在生产时间内扭秧歌，并过分地要求增加工资和提高福利。
    今年二月，该市总工会筹委扩大会议检讨了这种不正常的情况，提出了在一切公私营工厂中工会工作均须面向生产的方针。部分私营工厂由于工会工作人员广泛地宣传了这个正确方针，职工也逐渐认识搞好生产的重要性，加以工会对生产工作的具体组织与领导，其三、四月份的生产已有显著提高。私营沙市纱厂解放前平均日产纱二十九件，解放初期日产纱曾降至二十三件，三月份平均日产纱已从新提高到三○·一五件，四月份日产纱更增至三一·二五件。同时，资方也同意废除了抄身制度及若干旧的不合理的管理制度，并适当地改善了伙食，因而职工生产积极性更为提高。私营大明纱厂工会在向工人讲解面向生产的意义后，又召开职工代表会议，发动职工讨论生产问题，因而职工了解搞好生产的重要并积极进行生产。该厂三月份产布量竟达八六○匹，超过解放前月产量一二八匹，产纱数量亦较解放前最高月产量提高了百分之十强。有个别工友甚至在九小时半的时间内摇纱四十二车，打破了该厂历年的纪录。该厂资方也同意废除了抄身制度并改进了若干职工的福利事业。在工人明确认识搞好生产的重要性后，在资方同意废除了封建把头制并实行计件工资的条件下，私营天府煤矿的若干坑井三月上旬一轮班的产煤量，已由二月中旬一轮班九十五吨增达三○一吨。该厂职工生产情绪很高。
