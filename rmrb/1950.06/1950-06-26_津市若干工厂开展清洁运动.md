　　Several Factories in Tianjin Launch Cleanliness Campaign
    [Tianjin News] Tianjin Daily reports: In order to promote summer hygiene work in various factories, the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Public Health Bureau, and the Women's Federation organized more than 20 staff and family members to conduct cleanliness and hygiene promotion work in various factories. After the promotion, many factories and workers' residential areas launched cleanliness campaigns, mobilizing all employees to carry out a thorough cleaning. The No. 5 Cotton Mill added 33 sewage pools and 66 trash cans and will renovate toilets and install screen doors soon. The factory's wall newspaper also paid attention to commending employees who valued hygiene work. The long-dilapidated drainage ditch of the Tianjin Factory of North China Paper Company has also been repaired this time. In mid-May, the health clinic of the No. 6 Cotton Mill inspected 520 employee households, and the vast majority met cleanliness standards, with only 19 households still needing improvement. Some factories have also established regular hygiene inspection systems. For example, the No. 6 Cotton Mill stipulated that a dedicated person is responsible for inspecting and supervising the cleanliness of each household; Hengda Tobacco Factory formulated a hygiene agreement and regularly commends cleanliness models.

　　津市若干工厂开展清洁运动
    【天津讯】天津日报消息：为开展各工厂的夏季卫生工作，天津市总工会、公共卫生局、妇联等三单位曾组织二十余名职工家属赴各厂进行清洁卫生宣传工作。经宣传后，许多工厂与职工住宅区都掀起了清洁运动，动员全体职工举行了大扫除。中纺五厂并添设了三十三个污水池，六十六个垃圾箱，不日将翻修厕所，按装纱门。该厂的壁报并注意表扬重视卫生工作的职工。华北造纸公司天津厂多年失修的大水沟，这次也修好了。五月中旬，中纺六厂卫生所检查了职工家庭五百二十户，绝大部分都够清洁标准，仅十九户尚需改善。有的工厂并建立了经常的卫生检查制度，如中纺六厂规定专人负责检查和督促各户的清洁；恒大烟草厂订立了卫生公约，随时表扬清洁模范。
