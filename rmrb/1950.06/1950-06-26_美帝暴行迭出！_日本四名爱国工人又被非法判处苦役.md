　　U.S. Imperialist Atrocities Emerge One After Another!
　　Four Patriotic Japanese Workers Illegally Sentenced to Forced Labor Again
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 25th] Following the U.S. occupying forces' military court in Japan sentencing eight Japanese patriots to long-term forced labor on June 3rd, they recently illegally sentenced four Japanese patriotic workers to two years of forced labor. According to reports from the Associated Press and Kyodo News, four members of the Fuji Iron & Steel Workers' Union and Communist Party members, Ohashi Shuji, Ishikawa Toraji, Kashiwara Toshinori, and Sonobe Yasuo, who were implicated in the open letter of inquiry to MacArthur, were unreasonably sentenced to two years of forced labor on the 23rd after four days of illegal trial by the U.S. military court starting on the 20th.
　　According to the Associated Press, a large number of Japanese patriots arrested in connection with the same "incident," including thirty-seven people, will be tried in various Japanese courts.
　　Note: The letter of inquiry to MacArthur was written by progressive labor unions, led by the All-Japan Federation of Trade Union Liaison Council, and democratic organizations such as the Preparatory Committee of the National Democratic and National Liberation Front, based on the resolution of the "General Mobilization Rally to Break Through the Industrial Crisis" held in Tokyo on June 3rd. The letter questioned MacArthur about the anti-democratic measures taken by the Tokyo Police Department in prohibiting assemblies and demonstrations, and the U.S. military court's trial of eight Japanese patriots, and demanded the release of the eight patriots.

　　美帝暴行迭出！
    日本四名爱国工人又被非法判处苦役
    【新华社二十五日讯】驻日美国占领军军事法庭继六月三日判处八名日本爱国者长期苦役后，最近又非法判处四名日本爱国工人二年苦役。据合众社与共同社讯：被指与致麦克阿瑟的公开质询信事件有关的富士制铁所工人工会会员、共产党员大桥修治、石川寅次、柏原敏则及园部康雄四人，自二十日起经美国军事法庭四天的非法审讯后，于二十三日共同被无理判处苦役二年。
    据合众社讯，因同一“事件”被捕的大批日本爱国者，有三十七名将在各日本法院受审。
    按：致麦克阿瑟的质询信，系以全日本工会联络协议会为首的各进步工会及全国民主民族战线筹备委员会等民主团体根据六月三日在东京举行的“突破产业危机总奋起大会”的决议而写的，该信对于东京警察局禁止集会、示威及美国军事法庭审判八名日本爱国者这些反民主措施，向麦克阿瑟提出质询，并要求释放八名爱国者。
