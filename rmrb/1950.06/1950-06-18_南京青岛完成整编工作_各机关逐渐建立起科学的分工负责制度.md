Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th – The reorganization of the Nanjing Municipal Government agencies, the CCP committees, and the troops and schools has been initially completed, and more than a thousand redundant personnel have been successively gathered awaiting assignment. This reorganization implemented the instructions of the Central People's Government and the East China Military and Political Committee, first merging the superfluous or overlapping institutions. For example, the real estate management office, the literature and art office, and the news and publishing office under the Nanjing Military Control Commission, which had completed the takeover task, have been merged with or reassigned to the relevant departments under the Municipal People's Government. Secondly, new institutions were established according to work needs, especially appropriately expanding and strengthening the organizations at the district level. Four new district-level people's courts have been established in each district of the city. The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the CCP in the urban area has also established district committees at the district level in the city. In addition, a scientific work system has been universally established and improved in all agencies of the city; non-essential personnel have also been greatly reduced, and the number of odd-job workers in various agencies has been reduced from more than 2,000 to 1,093.
    Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 13th – The reorganization of Qingdao City has been basically completed. The new establishment after the reorganization has been reduced by more than a thousand people compared with the past. This reorganization proceeded relatively smoothly due to repeated ideological mobilization. After the reorganization, a system of responsibility at all levels was established in various agencies, and the work efficiency of many departments has been improved. For example, the new establishment of the Secretarial Section of the Municipal Education Bureau has been reduced by seven cadres compared with the past, and the Auditing Section of the Finance Bureau has been reduced by six cadres, but the work efficiency has not been reduced. In the past, all departments of the Education Bureau were busy with administrative affairs and could not go deep into the lower levels to promote work. Although the number of personnel has been reduced after the reorganization, it has been able to organize manpower to go down to inspect and guide due to the clear division of labor. The Municipal Government originally had 158 civil servants, and 108 have been reduced after the reorganization, but it can still complete the work tasks as usual. Qingdao City also handles extra-establishment personnel very carefully, and patients are given recuperation separately. Among the extra-establishment personnel, in addition to the 279 who have been transferred to fill the vacancies in the departments, the rest are currently undergoing study.

　　南京青岛完成整编工作
    各机关逐渐建立起科学的分工负责制度
    【新华社南京十六日电】南京市政府机关、中共党委以及部队、学校的整编工作已初步完成，千余编余人员已陆续集中等候调配。此次整编贯彻了中央人民政府和华东军政委员会的指示，首先裁并了多余的或重叠的机构。如南京市军事管制委员会所属已完成接管任务的房地产管理处、文艺处和新闻出版处等机关，已与市人民政府所属有关部门合并或改属建制。其次，根据工作需要，增设了新的机构，特别是适当地扩大和加强了区一级的组织。城内各区新设了四个区一级的人民法院。城区中共南京市委员会也在市内区一级增设了区委员会。此外，全市各机关普遍地建立和健全了科学的工作制度；非必需的人员也大量减少，各机关的勤杂人员已由二千多人减为一千零九十三人。
    【新华社青岛十三日电】青岛市整编工作已基本完成。整编后的新编制较过去减少千余人。这次整编由于经过反复思想动员，因之进行较为顺利。整编后各机关建立了按级负责制，不少部门工作效率已见提高。如市政府教育局秘书科新编制较过去减少了七个干部，财政局会审科减少六个干部，但工作效率并未减低。过去教育局各科都忙于机关事务，而不能深入下层推动工作，整编后人员虽已减少，但因分工明确，反能组织人力下去检查视导。市政府原有公务员一百五十八名，整编后减少了一○八名，仍能照常完成工作任务。青岛市对编外人员的处理也很慎重，病员分别予以疗养。编外人员中除有二百七十九人已被调配充实缺额的部门以外，其余正在进行学习中。
