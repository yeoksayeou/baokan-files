　　Cotton Yarn Company Supports Private Factories
    Loss of 700,000 Jin of Millet in Three Months
    Brisk Sales of Printed Cloth in June, Some Factories Violate Contracts and Sell Privately on the Market

    [Our Newspaper] In the context of stable prices and sluggish sales of goods, the Beijing Branch of the Cotton Yarn Company entrusted private weaving factories to process more than 79,000 bolts of various cloths and supplied more than 80,000 bundles of various yarns, paying a processing fee of 3.72 million jin of millet in March, April, and May. More than 600 factories, with the support of the company, solved difficulties such as raw materials, sales channels, and capital, and were able to recover and develop. Judging from the number of households supported by the Beijing Branch, the number in March increased by 48% compared to February, and the number in April increased by 4.52% compared to March. With the support of the company, some factories have increased the number of machines (such as the Huadong Factory, Cihua Factory, Jingwei Factory, Hao Xianting Factory, etc.), and opened night shifts (Hengdecheng Factory, Zhongsheng Factory, Hongguang Factory, Huadong Factory, etc.) to expand production. However, on the company's side, due to difficulties in quality and sales, a total of 700,000 jin of millet was lost in three months. Specifically, in March, 21,069 bolts of "August 1st" cloth were received, with a cost of 285,488 yuan per bolt and a selling price of 280,167 yuan per bolt, resulting in a total loss of 112,108,149 yuan, equivalent to 69,274 jin of millet; in April, 25,170 bolts of "August 1st" cloth were received, with a purchasing price of 220,626 yuan per bolt and a selling price of 195,000 yuan per bolt, resulting in a total loss of 645,006,420 yuan, equivalent to 523,120 jin of millet; in May, 12,843 bolts of "August 1st" cloth were received, with a cost of 221,725 yuan per bolt and a selling price of 210,959 yuan per bolt, resulting in a total loss of 138,267,738 yuan, equivalent to 115,223 jin of millet.

    [Another News] Since June, the sales of striped cloth have been brisk and profitable. In order to pursue excess profits, some private weaving factories, such as Yonghe and Fumaohou factories, have abandoned their contracts and did not deliver cloth to the company, but transported it to the market for sale. Furthermore, factories such as Yusheng, Hefengcheng, Shi Kunting, Huisheng, and Longxin, emphasized their difficulties and reduced the number of looms and the quantity of processing, selling the striped cloth on the market, which seriously affected the relationship between the public and private sectors. The company is currently conducting education. (Li Shu)

　　花纱布公司扶植私营工厂
    三个月亏本小米七十万斤 
    六月份花布销路呈旺，部分工厂不守合同，私向市场出售。
    【本报讯】北京花纱布分公司在物价稳定、商品滞销的情况下，三、四、五三个月共委托私营织布工厂加工各种布七万九千余匹，供给原料各支纱八万余捆，支付加工米三百七十二万斤。有六百多家工厂在公司扶植下，解决了原料、销路、资金等困难，并且得到了恢复和发展。就北京分公司扶植户数看，三月份较二月份增加百分之四十八，四月份较三月份增百分之四·五二”。在公司扶植下，一部分工厂已增设机器（如华东工厂、慈华工厂、经纬工厂、郝献亭工厂等），加开夜班（恒德成工厂、众生工厂、宏光工厂、华东工厂等），扩大生产。但在公司方面，则以质量及销路困难，三个月共亏小米七十万斤，计三月份收进“八一”布二一、○六九匹，每匹成本二八五、四八八元，售价二八○、一六七元，共亏一一二一○八、一四九元，折小米六九、二七四斤；四月份收进“八一”布二五、一七○匹，每匹收价二二○、六二六元，售价一九五、○○○元，共亏六四五、○○六、四二○元，折小米五二三、一二○斤；五月份收进“八一”布一二、八四三匹，每匹成本二二一、七二五元，售价二一○、九五九元，共亏一三八、二六七、七三八元，折米一一五、二二三斤。
    【又讯】自六月份起，条布销路呈旺，出售有利。为追逐超额利润，部分私营织布工厂如永和、福茂厚工厂，背弃合同，不向公司交布，竟运往市场出售。又如裕生、和丰成、石昆亭、惠生、隆信等工厂，则强调困难，缩减定织台数和加工数量，将条布去市场出售，严重地影响了公私关系。公司正进行教育中。（李树）
