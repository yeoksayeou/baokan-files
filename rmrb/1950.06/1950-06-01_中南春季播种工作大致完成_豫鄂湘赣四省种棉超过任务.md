Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 30th - Spring planting in rural areas of all provinces in the Central and Southern China region has been largely completed. Thanks to ample spring rains and the people's government's close leadership of spring plowing, planting was done in a timely manner, and the peasants' enthusiasm for production was ignited. Not only was planting completed on existing spring land and paddy fields, but farmers in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi also reclaimed 930,000 mu of wasteland. The cotton planting area has also exceeded last year's. Last year, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi planted a total of 8.63 million mu of cotton. This year, it has increased to more than 11 million mu, exceeding the Central People's Government's target of 10.27 million mu for the region.

The spring planting work was completed earlier in the wheat, cotton, and coarse grain areas north of the Yangtze and Han Rivers. Henan Province completed spring plowing and planting in early April, planting approximately 27.7 million mu of grain and cotton (including approximately 23.5 million mu of grain), accounting for 90 percent of the province's total spring land area (the remainder being fallow land and a very small amount of flooded land). In the rice-growing areas along the Yangtze River, lakes, and south of the Yangtze River, early rice transplanting has been completed. In Hunan Province, 90 percent of the mid-season rice transplanting was completed by the middle of this month. In Jiangxi Province, in addition to the completion of transplanting of 12 million mu of early rice, 20 million mu of late rice have also been sown and are about to be transplanted. Droughts occurred in some areas of Guangdong and Guangxi during rice transplanting this spring, but the transplanting work was not significantly affected due to the timely leadership of water conservancy construction by governments at all levels in the provinces. More than 30 million mu of rice fields in Guangdong Province have now been universally transplanted, and some mountainous areas have also been planted with soybeans, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and other coarse grains.

Because the provincial people's governments correctly implemented the policy of combining rent reduction with production, the peasants' production enthusiasm has been greatly enhanced. During spring plowing, farmers in various provinces also universally launched wasteland reclamation and water conservancy construction. Particularly in terms of water conservancy, great achievements have been made. For example, Jiangxi Province has completed the construction and repair of more than 13,000 ponds and reservoirs, which can irrigate 800,000 mu of farmland; completed the reinforcement of more than 10 million cubic meters of dikes, so that 2 million mu of land that suffered from disasters last year can be protected from flooding if it encounters the same water level as last year. It is estimated that the province will increase grain production by 4 million dan. In Hunan Province, according to statistics from only 23 counties including Pingjiang and Liuyang, more than 43,000 reservoirs and ponds have been completed, which are estimated to increase grain production by 70,000 to 80,000 shi.

The propagation and promotion of improved varieties of various crops is one of the characteristics of this year's spring planting. The promotion of "Ambassador Cotton" in Henan Province has been completed, and it is expected that the province may completely switch to planting "Ambassador Cotton" next year. Jiangxi Province has used more than 460,000 jin of improved rice seeds, such as "Nante No." and "Long-Grain Indica," cultivated by agricultural farms in various parts of the province, and selected key areas in Nanchang, Shangrao, Ji'an, Fuzhou, and other special districts for promotion. Yongxiu and Pengze cotton farms have propagated more than 300 mu of pure-bred Dai Zi cotton. Datopu Farm in Changsha, Hunan, has completed the breeding of 700 jin of excellent sweet potato varieties, which will be supplied to nearby farmers for planting in large quantities.

　　中南春季播种工作大致完成
    豫鄂湘赣四省种棉超过任务
    【新华社汉口三十日电】中南区各省农村的春耕播种均已大致完成。由于今年春雨充足，人民政府抓紧了对春耕的领导，做到不违农时，并启发了农民的生产热情，不仅原有春地、稻田都完成了播种工作，豫、鄂、湘、赣、桂五省农民并垦出荒地九十三万亩。植棉面积也超过了去年。去年豫、鄂、湘、赣四省共植棉八百六十三万亩，今年已增至一千一百万亩以上，超过了中央人民政府规定该区植棉一千零二十七万亩的任务。
    春播工作，以长江、汉水以北的麦、棉杂粮区完成较早。河南省在四月初旬春耕播种即已完毕，计播种粮食、棉花约二千七百余万亩（其中播种粮食约二千三百五十万亩），占该省春地总面积百分之九十（余为休憩地和极少的水淹地）。沿江沿湖及长江以南的水稻区，早稻插秧均已完毕。湖南省中稻插秧，本月中旬已插完百分之九十。江西省除一千二百万亩早稻已完成插秧外，二千万亩迟谷亦已播种，即将插秧。广东、广西部分地区在今春插秧时曾发生干旱现象，经各该省各级人民政府及时领导兴修水利，插秧工作未受到重大影响。广东省三千余万亩稻田现已普遍插秧，部分山地亦已种上大豆、花生、蕃茄等杂粮。
    由于各省人民政府正确地执行了减租与生产相结合的政策，农民生产情绪大为提高。各省农民在春耕中，同时普遍展开了垦荒和兴修水利工作。特别是在水利方面，成绩很大。如江西省已完成兴修水塘、水库共一万三千余座，可灌溉农田八十万亩；完成培修圩堤一千余万公方，使去年受灾的二百万亩田，在遇到与去年同等水位时可免受水灾。这样，估计该省将增产粮食四百万担。湖南省在兴修蓄水塘堰工作方面，仅据平江、浏阳等二十三县统计，已完成四万三千余座，估计可增产粮食七、八万石。
    进行各种农作物优良品种的繁殖和推广，为今年春播的特点之一，河南省“大使棉”的推广工作已经完成，预计明年该省即可能全部改种“大使棉”。江西省已以该省各地农场所育成的“南特号”、“长粒籼”等优良稻种四十六万余斤，分别在南昌、上饶、吉安、抚州等专区选择重点区推广。永修、彭泽两棉场已繁殖纯种岱字棉三百余亩。湖南长沙大托铺农场已完成甘薯优良品种育苗七百斤，将大量供给附近农民栽种。
