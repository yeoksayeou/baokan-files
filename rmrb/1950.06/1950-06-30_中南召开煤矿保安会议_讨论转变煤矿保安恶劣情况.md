　　Central South Holds Coal Mine Safety Conference
    Discussing Reversing Poor Coal Mine Safety Conditions
    [Our Newspaper Hankou News] In order to change the poor state of coal mine safety work in the Central South region, establish a safety production mindset among personnel at all levels, improve safety work, and completely eliminate all preventable accidents, the Central South Heavy Industry Department convened a six-province coal mine safety conference at the Pingxiang Coal Mine starting on the 20th of this month. The conference will convey the spirit of the National Coal Industry Conference in May and the "Resolution on Coal Mine Safety Issues." Based on the safety conditions reported by various provinces and mines, it will formulate the "Resolution on Coal Mine Safety Issues in the Central South Region" and "Implementation Measures for Future Safety Work." At the same time, the conference will specifically study the common and urgent problems existing in various mines.
    Since January of this year, serious accidents have occurred continuously in coal mines in the Central South region. Following the "February 27th" disaster at the Yiluo Coal Mine, major accidents have occurred at the Xiangjiang Coal Mine, the jointly state-private operated Yuanling Xieji Coal Mine, and the private pithead coal mine in Shangrao, Jiangxi. According to preliminary statistics, from January to the end of May, a total of 22 accidents occurred in state-owned and private coal mines in the six provinces of Central South, resulting in the deaths of 218 workers and injuries to 268, a very serious situation.
    The reasons for the frequent accidents and large number of casualties are that the fundamental nature of coal mines in the Central South region has not yet been transformed from old bureaucratic enterprises into new people's enterprises. The masses of workers have not been well mobilized, the "ba tou" (foreman) system has not been completely abolished, and there are still gaps in the relationship between employees. Although the Central Fuel Industry Department and the Central South Region Heavy Industry Department have issued various instructions to strengthen mine safety work, there are extremely divergent views among the leading cadres and engineering personnel of the Central South coal mines. First of all, the leading cadres of factories and mines do not pay enough attention to "safety first." Some administrative heads push safety work to the trade union; some mines lock the safety regulations issued by the Central South Heavy Industry Department in drawers; some mines have formulated more than 200 safety regulations and prohibitions, but the workers do not know about them. Secondly, some engineering personnel mistakenly believe that "going down the mine is a three-point disaster," and whether one is injured or killed depends entirely on fate; others emphasize that equipment determines everything, believing that the safety equipment of Central South coal mines is not as good as that of Northeast and North China, and the casualty rate is naturally incomparable. Furthermore, some leading cadres and engineering personnel are troubled by the lack of solutions, do not know how to do safety work, and feel a heavy responsibility; even a few people have developed negative thoughts and are afraid. For example, an engineering staff member in a certain mine is ready to go to jail at any time and has entrusted friends to take care of his affairs after his death, but has not actively thought of solutions.
    The Central South Heavy Industry Department attaches great importance to this conference. Through the conference, the higher-level leading organs will further study the actual situation and difficulties together with the lower-level cadres, so that the leadership direction and intentions will become clearer to the lower levels, overcoming the bureaucratic style of leading cadres and the fear of responsibility and negative thinking of some factory and mine administrative cadres and engineering personnel; the conference will formulate a series of safety regulations and systems, and actively put forward a set of methods to strengthen safety work; at the same time, the conference will organize joint inspections of the Pingxiang Coal Mine by various units, on the one hand, to improve the shortcomings of the Pingxiang Mine, and at the same time, to learn from experience and implement it in their own mines. Therefore, this six-province coal mine safety conference will be a turning point in changing the current safety situation in Central South coal mines.

### 中南召开煤矿保安会议  讨论转变煤矿保安恶劣情况

　　中南召开煤矿保安会议
    讨论转变煤矿保安恶劣情况
    【本报汉口讯】为改变中南区煤矿保安工作的恶劣情况，树立各级人员保安生产的思想，改进保安工作，彻底消灭一切责任事故，中南重工业部于本月二十日起在萍乡煤矿召开六省煤矿保安会议。会中将传达五月全国煤业会议的精神和“关于煤矿保安问题决议”，并根据各省、各矿所汇报之保安情况，制定“中南区煤矿保安问题决议”及“今后保安工作执行办法”。同时会议还将具体研究目前各矿普遍存在而急待解决的问题。
    中南区煤矿自今年一月以来，不断发生严重事故。继宜洛煤矿“二·二七”灾变后，有湘江煤矿、公私合营的沅陵协记煤矿，及江西上饶私营坑口煤矿等较大事故发生。据初步统计，一月至五月底，中南六省公营、私营煤矿共发生事故二十二次，死工友二百十八名，伤二百六十八名，情况极为严重。
    造成事故频繁和死伤人数众多的原因，是中南煤矿的基本性质尚未从旧的官僚企业转变为人民的新企业，工人群众没有没好地发动起来，把头制度没有彻底废除，职工间的关系还有隔阂。中央燃料工业部和中南区重工业部虽曾发出各项加强矿山保安工作的指示，但中南煤矿领导干部及工程人员中却存在着极为分歧的思想。首先是厂矿领导干部对“安全第一”重视不够。有的行政负责人将保安工作推给工会；有的矿把中南重工业部发的保安规程锁在抽屉里；有的矿虽然订了二百多条保安条例和禁例，工人却不知道。其次，部分工程人员错误地认为“下井三分灾”，伤亡不伤亡全凭命运好坏；有的则强调设备决定一切，认为中南煤矿的保安设备不如东北、华北，伤亡率当然也不能相比。再次，也有部分领导干部及工程人员苦于没有办法，不知保安工作应该怎样做，感到责任沉重；甚至有少数人产生消极思想，害怕，如某矿一位工程人员随时准备坐牢，并已将身后事托朋友照顾，但却没有从积极方面想办法。
    中南重工业部对此次会议极为重视，通过会议将使上级领导机关更进一步与下级干部共同研究实际情况和困难，使下面愈加明确领导方针和领导意图，克服领导干部的官僚主义作风和部分厂矿行政干部及工程人员的怕负责任及消极思想；会议将制定一系列的保安规章和制度，积极的提出加强保安工作的一套办法；同时会议并将组织各单位联合检查萍乡煤矿，一方面改进萍乡矿的缺点，同时可吸取经验，贯彻到自己的矿山中去。因此，此次所召开的六省煤矿保安会议，将是改变目前中南煤矿保安情况的转折点。
