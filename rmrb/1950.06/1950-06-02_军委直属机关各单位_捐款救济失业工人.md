　　Units Directly Under the Military Commission
    Donate Funds to Relieve Unemployed Workers
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission issued a call to the entire army on April 26 to conserve and donate to relieve unemployed worker brothers in Shanghai and major cities, the units directly under the Military Commission, under the supply system, have responded to this call by lowering food standards, and some have contributed allowances and years of savings. In the past two weeks, according to the statistics of only eight units, they have donated 3,925 jin of millet, 57.90712 million yuan in Renminbi, 1.7 liang of pure gold, as well as silver dollars, Hong Kong dollars, watches and other items. This movement is still being vigorously carried out in other units. (Chen Bingchen)

　　军委直属机关各单位
    捐款救济失业工人
    【本报讯】自中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会于四月二十六日向全军发出救济上海及各大城市失业工人兄弟节约捐助的号召后，军委直属各单位在供给制情况下，降低伙食标准，有的献出津贴和长年的积蓄来响应了这一号召。两旬来，仅就八个单位的统计，已捐献小米三千九百二十五斤、人民币五千七百九十万七千一百二十元、赤金一两七钱以及银元、港币、手表等物件。这一运动尚在其他单位热烈开展着。（陈秉忱）
