Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: The Central Ministry of Trade, in order to implement Article 1 of the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee's directive strictly prohibiting government agencies and military units from engaging in commercial activities, which stipulates that "shops established in the past by government agencies, military units, and schools should be transferred to state-owned trading organizations, and cash recovered, or they should be closed down," issued the "Instructions on Measures for Receiving Commercial Operations from Government Agencies and Military Units" on May 29th.

Regarding the scope of reception, the instructions stipulate: Those shops established by government agencies and military units that deal in the main commodities operated by state-owned trading companies and are of a larger scale shall be received by the state-owned specialized trading companies or retail companies that handle those commodities; those shops that deal in commodities not handled by state-owned trading companies or are of too small a scale to be easily received may be closed down on their own. Retail departments established by government agencies and military units for purchasing raw materials and promoting finished products for factories, as well as cooperative societies for government employees and military personnel, are not included in the scope of reception.

The instructions stipulate that the handover work of shops of government agencies and military units in various places shall be led by the local Financial and Economic Committee or the Commerce Department/Bureau, which will form a handover committee. This committee shall be responsible for formulating specific reception plans and adjudicating disputes during the reception process.

Regarding the handling of personnel and goods in the received shops, the instructions stipulate: All personnel shall be transferred to work in state-owned trading companies; all goods shall be handed over and priced, with the local Financial and Economic Committee or the Commerce Department/Bureau deciding on the price based on local market prices, adhering to the principle of fairness and reasonableness.

In addition, the instructions have clear provisions regarding the handling of payments, the buildings and furniture of the receiving units, and debts.

The instructions require that government agency shops and relevant specialized companies must practice strict economy and prevent waste during the handover process; the competent authorities of government agency shops should also conduct a strict inspection of past accounts during the inventory period to eliminate malpractices.
