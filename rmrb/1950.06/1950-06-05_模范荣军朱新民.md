Model Soldier Zhu Xinmin
    By Yu Gengtian
    Comrade Zhu Xinmin, a model soldier, came to Xinglong Village, Shuangjing District, Hulan County, Songjiang Province, for recuperation in June of the year before last. It was during the time when the old crops had been exhausted and the new ones had not yet been harvested, and there was a grain shortage. He and the masses ate vegetable porridge together to get through the famine. Later, the government allocated him one qing (equivalent to ten mu) and one mu and three fen of land, and wanted to send workers to help him with the work. He was unwilling to increase the burden on the masses, so he declined.
    Last spring, he was elected as a village people's representative. During the spring plowing season, the village held a village people's representative meeting to discuss contracting land to military families and soldiers. He was the first to propose that everyone not contract land, and promoted other honored veterans to participate in labor. He took the lead in joining the labor exchange group. The government called for early planting, but the masses were unwilling to plant because the soil was dry. He mobilized his group to plant first, which promoted planting throughout the village.
    In production, he was not only able to take the lead in promoting others, but also very effective in leading the team. In his own team, he led everyone to evaluate work points and record work logs. He not only led his own team well, but also helped other teams. For example, the Song Xi and Zhang Guanghai teams often argued and couldn't work together. He educated and helped them with scoring and accounting, and led these two teams well.
    When delivering public grain, he prepared his public grain very early. He exchanged sorghum for soybeans, sieved them once, and picked out the broken halves. He also mobilized the masses to deliver good grain. Because he was a district representative for veterans, Gao Shigui, a veteran from his village, and several veterans from other villages came to him, asking not to pay public grain. He explained to them, "We fought for the people at the front, and we must serve the people in the rear. If we don't pay public grain, won't it increase the burden on the masses?" After his explanation, the veterans were very willing to pay public grain.
    When the green crops were growing, he organized the village's militia, took the lead in standing guard, patrolling, and preventing sabotage by bad elements. During the autumn harvest, he intensified his leadership of the militia to protect the crops.
    After threshing, he got up early every day to collect manure, collecting eight or nine cartloads throughout the winter, enough for one qing of land. This promoted the manure collection movement throughout the village.
    Last year, he planted one qing and eight mu and five fen of land, applied manure to one qing and two mu of land, and plowing, harrowing, hauling, and threshing were all done by himself through labor exchange. The one qing and one mu and three fen of sorghum, when sowing, he mixed the seeds with two and a half jin of oil, plowed and harrowed three times, and weeded once. He harvested ten shi and six dou; the six mu and two fen of millet yielded seven shi; one mu of corn yielded one shi and five dou; totaling more than nineteen shi of grain. This was all because he worked with the masses through labor exchange, planted early, plowed early, harrowed deeply, and cultivated carefully.
    Last June, during the drought, the government called for conservation and preparation for famine, and he took the lead in doing so. When the crops were no longer being weeded, he ate two meals a day: one dry meal and one thin porridge. He saved a total of more than one hundred and fifty jin of grain. This also influenced the masses, who also saved a lot of grain. After the weeding season, he made more than a thousand mud bricks himself. He also cut two hundred bundles of grass and built a warehouse himself. At this county people's representative meeting, he was elected as a provincial people's representative.

　　模范荣军朱新民
    于耕田
    荣军朱新民同志是前年六月来到松江省呼兰县双井区兴隆村休养的。那时正是青黄不接闹粮荒的时候。他和群众一齐吃菜粥度过了粮荒。后来，政府分给他一垧（合十亩）一亩三分地，并要派工帮他干活。他不愿加重群众负担，就谢绝了。
    去年春天，他被选为村人民代表。在春耕时村里召开村人民代表会，讨论给军属、荣军包耕。他首先提出不要大家包耕，并且推动别的荣誉退伍军人参加劳动。他自己带头参加了换工组。政府号召早种地，可是群众因为土干都不愿意种。他就动员自己的小组先种，推动了全村都种上了。
    在生产上，他不但能带头推动别人，而且在领导小组方面，也是很有办法的。他在自己的小组里，领导大家评马分、记工账。他不但把自己的小组领导好了，而且也帮助别的小组。如宋喜、张广海两组常打唧唧，干不到一块去。他就去进行教育帮助评分算账，把这两小组也领导好了。
    送公粮的时候，他自己很早就把公粮准备好。他用高粱换了黄豆，用筛子筛了一遍，又把破半子都挑了出去。他又发动群众送好的粮食。因为他是区荣军代表，当时本村荣军高士贵和外村的几个荣军都来找他，要求不缴公粮。他给他们解释说：“咱们在前方是为人民打仗，在后方也要为人民服务。咱们要是不出公粮，不是给群众增加了负担吗？”经过他这一番解释，荣军们都很愿意地缴了公粮。
    在青纱帐起的时候，他把全村的自卫队都组织起来，带头站岗放哨、巡更下夜、防止坏分子破坏。到秋收时，他更加紧领导民兵，保护庄稼。
    打完场，他天天起早拾粪，一冬拾了八、九车，能上一垧地。这样就推动了全村的拾粪运动。
    去年他种了一垧八亩五分地，上了一垧二亩地粪，铲、趟、拉、打都是自己换工侍弄的。一垧一亩三分高粱，下种的时候，他把种子拌上了二斤半油，铲趟三遍，耨一遍。打了十石六斗；六亩二分谷子打了七石；一亩苞米打了一石五斗；共计打了十九石多粮。这都是因为和群众在一起换工，种的早，铲的早，趟的深，精耕细作的缘故。
    去年六月天旱，政府号召节约备荒，他就带头做。在挂锄的时候，他每天吃两顿饭：一顿干的，一顿稀的。一共节省了一百五十多斤粮食。并且影响了群众，也节省不少粮食。挂锄后，他又自己托坯一共托了一千多块坯。还打了二百捆草，自己盖了一间仓房。在这次县人民代表会上，他被选为省人民代表。
