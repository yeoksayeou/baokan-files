　　Readers Expose Corruption and Waste by Village Cadres, Hoping the Qingfeng County Government Will Conduct a Thorough Investigation

The village cadres of Tiwa Village in Qingfeng County, Pingyuan Province, are engaged in corruption and waste, and are falsely reporting arrears in public grain. The facts are as follows:

　　(1) Tiwa Village has a total of 96 households. Recently, when the village was filling out land certificates, there were only five working cadres, but eight or nine people were constantly eating public meals. It took 45 days to complete the task. On the day of completion, all 25 village cadres had a feast. In the end, each household had to provide six liang of millet for the people filling out the land certificates to eat, and in addition, each mu of land was assessed one jin and two liang of corn, totaling 502 jin of rice. Each mu was assessed two and a half jin of firewood, totaling 1,115 and a half jin (the village has a total of 446.2 mu of land).

　　(2) During the land reform in the village, three pear trees and one Chinese toon tree that remained after the distribution were sold by the village cadres. The Chinese toon tree was sold for three dou of jade grain, and the pear trees were sold for one dou and three sheng of wheat, all of which were embezzled by the village cadres. They also consumed two jin of lamp oil for the winter school when filling out land certificates, causing the winter school to be suspended due to lack of lamp oil. The youth in the village are extremely dissatisfied with this matter.

　　(3) During the autumn grain collection last year, the masses actively paid public grain, and there were no arrears. However, the village cadres saw that other villages had reported arrears (because of the poor autumn harvest in the area, it was impossible to pay the full amount of public grain), so they deducted 158 jin of millet from the public grain collected from their own village and consumed it when filling out the land certificates. However, they falsely reported arrears to the district, saying that the masses really could not afford to pay. When collecting public grain, they added one jin for every 80 jin collected for their own benefit. In addition, all the village cadres divided the office expenses during the Lunar New Year. Each person received 12 jin of grain.

Regarding the above matters, we suggest that the Qingfeng County Government quickly send someone to investigate and deal with them.

### 读者揭发村干部贪污浪费  望清丰县府深入调查处理

　　读者揭发村干部贪污浪费  望清丰县府深入调查处理
    平原清丰县堤洼村村干部贪污浪费，并假报公粮尾欠。事实如下：
    （一）堤洼村共九六户。最近该村在填写土地证时，工作干部只有五人，而经常吃公饭的却有八九人。连续填了四十五天才完成。在填写完毕的那一日，全村干部二十五人大吃一顿。最后每户除拿出小米六两给填写土地证的人吃饭之外，每一亩地还被派玉米一斤二两，共合五百零二斤米。每亩被摊派柴二斤半，共合一千一百一十五斤半（该村共有地四百四十六亩二分）。
    （二）该村在土地改革时，分配剩下的梨树三棵、椿树一棵，被村干部卖了。椿树卖玉粮三斗、梨树卖麦子一斗三升，都为村干部所贪污。他们并在填写土地证时吃掉冬学的灯油二斤，使冬学因为缺乏灯油而停办了。村中青年对此事极为不满。
    （三）去年秋征时，群众积极缴纳公粮，没有尾欠。但村干部看到外村都报了尾欠（因该地区秋季歉收，缴不齐公粮），即从本村所征公粮中扣下小米一百五十八斤，并在填写土地证时吃了。但是他们却向区上假报尾欠，说群众实在缴不起。在征收公粮时，他们每收八十斤即外加一斤以自肥。此外，全村干部在旧历年关，把办公费分了。每人分到谷子十二斤。
    关于以上的事情，我们建议清丰县政府赶快派专人调查处理。
