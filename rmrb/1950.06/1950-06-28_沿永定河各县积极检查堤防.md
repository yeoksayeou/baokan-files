　　Counties Along the Yongding River Actively Inspect Dikes

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The counties along the Yongding River in Hebei Province are actively conducting a second inspection of the dikes. Before the spring construction began, a major inspection of the dikes was carried out on both sides of the river, laying a good foundation for the spring dike restoration work. Currently, as the spring construction is about to end and the flood season is approaching, the Spring Construction Committee of the river system, on May 30th, made arrangements for a second major inspection of the dikes in the counties along the river, requiring further elimination of animal burrows and water seepage points, and consolidation of the riverbanks. It also emphasized the universal use of probing to lay a solid foundation for flood prevention. The aforementioned work requirements were completed in early June. During this inspection, 46 badger dens were discovered on the dikes in Daxing County. During the inspection, more than 2,000 workers were mobilized in various counties, and they are now excavating, filling, and compacting the areas.

　　沿永定河各县积极检查堤防
    【本报讯】河北沿永定河各县积极进行二次堤防检查。该河两岸在春工尚未动工之前，曾进行了一次堤防大检查，给春工复堤工作打下了良好基础。目前春工将要结束，汛期即将到来，该河系春工委员会，在五月三十日，又对沿河各县作了二次堤防大检查的布置，要求进一步消灭兽窝、水眼，巩固河堤。并强调普遍进行钎试，以奠定巩固河防基础。上述工作要求已于六月上旬完成。在这次检查中，大兴县堤岸即发现了獾窠四十六处。检查中各县共动员民工二千余名，现正于挖掘后，进行填堵夯实工作。
