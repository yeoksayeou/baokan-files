    Over Ten Thousand Children Visit

    [Report from this newspaper] The "Celebrating June 1st International Children's Day Exhibition," jointly organized by the Capital's June 1st International Children's Day Preparatory Committee, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Beijing Library, has attracted over ten thousand visitors in the six days since its opening on June 1st. Children make up the majority of the visitors. The exhibition will close on the 15th of this month. After viewing the exhibited photos, the children felt excited and happy, and gained inspiration from them. A Young Pioneer team member, signing as "Newborn Young Pioneers," wrote in the suggestion book: "Here we see how wonderful the lives of Soviet children are, so we should study hard to make our New China as prosperous and happy as the Soviet Union." Some mothers wrote after seeing the exhibition: "Their (referring to Soviet children) today is our tomorrow." "What should we Chinese mothers do to strive for this?" Others wrote: "Children unite, children's parents unite, oppose wars of aggression, and defend world peace!" (Chen Zhongchi)

　　庆祝“六一”图片展览会
    万余儿童前往参观
    【本报讯】首都六一国际儿童节筹委会、苏联对外文化协会及北京图书馆联合举办的“庆祝六一国际儿童节展览会”，自六月一日开幕后，六天内前往参观者已达万余人。其中儿童占大部分。该会将于本月十五日结束。儿童们看了展览的图片后，都感到兴奋愉快，并从图片中得到了启示。一个署名新生少年儿童队员的在批评簿中写着：“在这里我们看到苏联儿童的生活是那样的美好，所以我们应当努力学习，使我们新中国也和苏联一样的富强康乐。”有些母亲们看后写着：“他们（指苏联儿童）的今天就是我们的明天。”“我们中国作母亲的人应该如何努力呢？”还有人写着：“儿童们联合起来，儿童的父母联合起来，反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平！”              （陈仲篪）
