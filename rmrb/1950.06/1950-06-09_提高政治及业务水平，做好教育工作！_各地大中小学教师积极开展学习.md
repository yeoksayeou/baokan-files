Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th. Teachers at all levels of schools in Northeast China have extensively carried out political and professional studies. Among the 95,000 teachers in universities, middle, and primary schools in Northeast China, the majority have devoted a certain amount of time each day to individual or collective study.

　　In universities, teaching and research groups or lectures composed of professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from the same department or faculty have generally been established. They mainly carry out political and professional studies and scientific research; they help each other solve difficult problems and improve teaching methods in their professional work; they also preliminarily review teaching outlines or lecture notes to provide reference for the president, deans, and department heads during inspections. However, because this type of organization has not been established for long, it is not very sound and is being continuously strengthened.

　　In secondary schools, many have implemented a two-hour daily study system. One hour is for political theory study and one hour is for professional study. Dalian City and the provinces of Songjiang and Heilongjiang have also opened amateur supplementary schools or night schools for middle school teachers. Shenyang City has established a teaching research association to improve teachers' cultural and professional levels. Various regions have organized intensive training for middle school teachers during winter and summer vacations. According to statistics, over 3,500 teachers participated in the intensive training last winter vacation, accounting for 67 percent of the total number of middle school teachers. Teachers in various schools also frequently conduct mutual observation of teaching and discussions in their daily teaching work, which has been very effective.

　　In primary schools in various regions, most also stipulate two hours of political theory and professional study each day. In terms of professional study, there are teaching lectures, typical reports, and observation teaching. Lushun, Dalian, Harbin, Tonghua, and other places have opened in-service primary school teacher refresher night schools, hiring middle school teachers to give subject-based lectures. Intensive training methods are also often adopted during winter and summer vacations or busy farming seasons, so that each teacher can have the ability to teach the main cultural and scientific knowledge of the entire primary school stage. According to statistics from five provinces including Songjiang, Liaodong, and Liaoxi, over 26,500 primary school teachers participated in intensive training last summer vacation, accounting for about one-third of the total number of in-service teachers. The level of teachers in various regions has improved after intensive training. The phenomenon of not being content with primary school education has been greatly reduced.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 2nd. Over the past year, the political theory, cultural, and professional levels of in-service teachers in primary and secondary schools in Shanxi Province have improved a step further through study movements.

　　More than 50 percent of the 22,000 primary school teachers in the province have advanced or primary school graduation qualifications. Among the 1,100 middle school teachers in six counties including Taiyuan, Changzhi, Yuci, Xingxian, Fenyang, and Xinxian, over 700 have high school or junior high school cultural levels, and most of them are new teachers who have joined the workforce after liberation. Most teachers have a poor understanding of the new educational spirit and the responsibilities of teachers. Some believe that educational work has no future, and some view education as a "supra-class" career, and teachers as "supra-political." Some teachers even have the mistaken view that "it's better to have three dou of grain at home than to be a children's king." Therefore, many people are irresponsible in their work; in terms of cultural and professional knowledge, they cannot study and improve in a timely manner. After the establishment of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government in September last year, in order to improve the quality of primary and secondary school teachers in a planned and step-by-step manner, it successively convened meetings of middle school principals and education section chiefs of various special districts, and made specific requirements and arrangements for improving teacher quality and strengthening teachers' political and professional learning. Various special districts and counties, as well as Taiyuan City, successively organized learning committees. Learning committee branches or learning groups were organized in 69 provincial and county-run middle schools and more than 18,860 primary schools across the province. The content of study, in the old liberated areas, focuses on cultural learning and professional research in addition to general political theory study; in the new liberated areas, the emphasis is on the study of political theory and current affairs policies. In addition, teachers throughout the province have also undergone universal centralized learning during winter and summer vacations, with more than 33,000 people participating in the study. Some special districts and county people's governments have also established teacher training classes, and some counties have transferred strong cadres to be specifically responsible for leading teacher learning. After in-service learning, intensive training, and rotational training, teachers in various regions have made significant progress in politics and professional work. Some young teachers have requested to join the League after intensive training during winter and summer vacations. In the three counties of Yuci, Quwo, and Shouyang alone, 68 teachers have joined the New Democratic Youth League. Many teachers have gained the love and praise of the masses for improving their teaching methods. Sun Han-san, a teacher from Shangwujing Village in Pingshun County, was awarded a "Model Teacher" banner by the parents of all the children in the village for his diligent and patient education of children.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 7th. After a year of study, teachers in Wuhan's primary and secondary schools have made significant progress. Teaching plans are established, and the ideological nature of the curriculum is emphasized.

　　After a year of study and transformation, teachers in primary and secondary schools in Wuhan have made significant progress in politics and professional work. Among the 3,931 faculty and staff members in the city, more than 2,000 have participated in winter and summer vacation training courses; 88 percent of teachers have been organized into the Educational Workers' Union, and 66 faculty and staff members who are active in their work and progressive in their thinking have been promoted to principals or directors; 22 outstanding middle school teachers have been trained as teachers for worker-peasant middle schools.

　　After the liberation of Wuhan, the People's Government successively held three sessions of winter and summer vacation teacher training courses, and jointly organized weekly lectures and subject-based business seminars with the Federation of Primary and Secondary School Teachers. After the start of this semester, it also used spare time to organize systematic theoretical studies such as the history of social development, and mobilized teachers to visit factories and rural areas to strengthen the education of labor concepts. After this series of studies and transformations, the vast majority of teachers criticized the past erroneous thoughts of being supra-class, neglecting labor, and holding mercenary views, and initially established a revolutionary outlook on life.

　　In the past year of teaching, teachers in various schools have demonstrated a sense of responsibility and creativity. At the beginning of this semester, teachers in various schools have formulated teaching plans according to the nature of their business, and put forward the slogan of "no unprepared lessons"; and universally emphasize the ideological nature of the curriculum. For example, Liu Hanzhang, a teacher at the No. 1 Girls' Middle School in the city, used the calculation of compound interest in his mathematics class to explain the degree of cruelty of landlords in exploiting farmers by using usurious methods such as "green seedlings" and "donkey rolling." Teachers in various schools have also made considerable achievements in responding to the Education Bureau's call for labor to build schools and implementing the policy of opening the door to workers and peasants. For example, teachers from the Municipal Fifth Primary School, the Forty-seventh Primary School, and the Seventh Primary School have personally repaired dilapidated classrooms, desks, and benches, and made blackboards, saving the school a lot of repair and construction expenses, enabling municipal schools to increase the number of classes by 137 and absorb a large number of workers' and peasants' children. Many primary and secondary school teachers also use their spare time to run worker-peasant night schools or organize cultural study classes in factories to carry out worker-peasant spare time education. In addition, teachers actively participated in the purchase of public bonds, pay cuts, and disaster relief movements. Teachers in only four municipal middle schools purchased 2,242 public bonds and cut their salaries by 4,122 points. At present, teachers in various schools are further unfolding the study of the land reform policy in connection with the central task of the Central South Region this year, preparing to participate in this major rural social reform movement after autumn.

　　提高政治及业务水平，做好教育工作！
    各地大中小学教师积极开展学习
    东北：大中小学教师九万五千余人，大部均已做到每天有一定时间进行学习。
    【新华社沈阳七日电】东北各级学校教员广泛开展了政治与业务学习。东北九万五千余名大、中、小学教员中，大部分已拿出一定的时间进行个人或集体学习。
    在高等学校内，一般均建立了由同科、系的教授、讲师、助教等组成的教学研究组或讲座，主要进行政治业务学习和科学研究工作；在业务上互相帮助解决困难问题和改进教授方法；还初步审查讲授提纲或讲义，以提供校长、院长和系主任检查时的参考，但这种组织由于建立不久，还不很健全，正在继续加强中。
    在中等学校内，许多已执行了每日两小时的学习制。其中一小时为政治理论学习，一小时为业务学习。大连市与松江、黑龙江等省还开办了中学教师业余补习学校或教师夜校，沈阳市成立了教学研究会，以提高教员的文化与业务水平。各地在寒假与暑假中均组织了中学教师集训，据统计：去年寒假参加集训的教员达三千五百余人，占中学教员总数百分之六十七。各学校教员在日常教学工作中亦多进行互相观摩教学和讨论会，收效颇大。
    在各地的小学校中大部分亦规定每日有两小时的政治理论和业务学习。在业务学习方面有教学讲座、典型报告和观摩教学等。旅顺、大连、哈尔滨、通化等地曾开办在职小学教师进修夜校，聘请中学教员作分科讲授，在寒暑假或农忙假中，亦多采取了集训的办法，以使每个教师都能具备教授整个小学阶段主要文化科学知识的能力。据松江、辽东、辽西等五省的统计：去年暑假参加集训的小学教师有二万六千五百余人，约占在职教员总数的三分之一。各地经过集训的小学教师，其水平均有提高。不安心于小学教育工作的现象已大大减少。
    山西：全省一万九千余所中小学均已建立了学委会或学习小组。
    【新华社太原二日电】山西省中小学在职教员，经过一年来的学习运动，政治理论、文化及业务水平均较前提高了一步。
    全省二万二千余小学教员中有百分之五十以上是高级或初级小学毕业程度的。太原、长治、榆次、兴县、汾阳、忻县等六县一千一百余名中学教员中，具有高中、初中文化水平者，就占了七百余人，且多系解放后参加工作的新教员。多数教员对新教育精神与教师的责任认识很差，有的认为教育工作没有前途，有的把教育看成是“超阶级”的事业，而教师又是“超政治”的。甚至有的教师还存在着“家有三斗粮，不当孩子王”的错误观点。因此，不少人在工作中不负责任；在文化及业务知识上，不能及时钻研和提高。山西省人民政府于去年九月成立以后，为有计划有步骤地提高中小学教师的质量，曾先后召开了中等学校校长会议与各专署教育科长会议，对于提高教师质量，加强教师政治、业务的学习，都作了具体的要求和布置。各专区和各县与太原市先后组织了学委会，全省六十九所省、县立中学与一万八千八百六十余所小学中，组织了学委分会或学习小组。学习内容，在老区除一般的政治理论学习外，着重文化学习及业务研究；新区着重政治理论与时事政策的学习。此外，全省教师在寒假、暑假中又进行了普遍的集中学习，参加学习的达三万三千余人。有的专区和县人民政府并成立了教员轮训班，部分县并抽调强的干部，专门负责领导教员学习。各地教师经过在职学习与集训、轮训等学习后，在政治和业务上都有显著进步。有些青年教员在寒暑假集训后，提出了入团的要求，仅榆次、曲沃、寿阳三县，即有六十八名教员加入了新民主主义青年团。不少教员因为改进教学方法，获得了群众的爱戴与表扬。平顺上午井村教员孙汉三，因为勤苦耐心地教育儿童，全村儿童家长送给了他“模范教师”的奖旗。
    武汉：各校教师经一年学习有显著进步，教学订立计划，并重视课程的思想性。
    【新华社汉口七日电】武汉市中小学教师经过一年来的学习改造，在政治上与业务上均获得显著进步。全市三千九百三十一名教职员中，有二千余人参加过寒暑假讲习会的学习；百分之八十八的教师已组织到教育工作者工会中，有六十六个工作积极、思想进步的教职员，被提升为校长或主任；二十二个优秀的中学教师，被培养作为工农中学的教师。
    武汉市解放以后，人民政府曾先后举办了三期寒暑假教师讲习会，并与中小学教师联合会合办了星期讲座和各科业务座谈会。本学期开学以后，又利用业余时间，组织了社会发展史等系统的理论学习，并发动教师们参观工厂和访问农村，加强劳动观念的教育。绝大部分的教师经过这一系列的学习和改造，批判了过去存在的超阶级、轻视劳动等错误思想和雇佣观点，初步树立了革命的人生观。
    在一年来的教学中，各校教师都发挥了责任心与创造性。各校教师在本学期开学时，都按业务性质订立讲授计划，提出“不上无准备的课”的口号；并普遍重视课程的思想性。如市一女中教师刘汉章，在讲数学课时，便以复利息的计算，说明地主用“青苗”、“驴打滚”等高利贷的方法以剥削农民的残酷程度。各学校教师在响应教育局劳动建校的号召和贯彻向工农开门的方针方面，也有不少成绩。如市立第五小学、第四十七小学、第七小学等校的教师，都亲自动手整修破烂的教室、桌凳和制作黑板，为学校节省了不少的修理建设经费，使市立学校得以增办了一百三十七个班，大量吸收工农子女入学。许多中小学教师，并利用课余休息时间，举办工农夜校或在工厂内组织文化学习班，进行工农业余教育。此外，教师们还积极参加了购买公债、减薪和救灾运动。仅四个市立中学的教师即购买公债二千二百四十二分，减薪四千一百二十二分。现各校教师正结合中南区今年的中心任务，进一步展开土地改革政策的学习，准备秋后参加这一重大的农村社会改革运动。
