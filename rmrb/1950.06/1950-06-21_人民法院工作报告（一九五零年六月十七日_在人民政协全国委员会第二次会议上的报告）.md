People's Court Work Report
(Report to the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 17, 1950)
Chairman Shen Junru, members, and gentlemen:

Our Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government was established last November. Before this, local people's courts at all levels had already been established in North China, Northeast China, and parts of the old liberated areas of Northwest China, East China, and Central and South China, and a group of people's judicial cadres had been trained through practical work. They created and accumulated valuable experience in building people's courts, as well as working methods and styles of work that are adapted to the nature of our regime and meet the actual needs of the people, based on the mass line. This provided favorable conditions for us to further build people's courts and people's judicial work on a national scale. Our Supreme People's Court was established on this basis. In the past six months, with the complete liberation of the northwestern, southwestern, and southern provinces along the Yangtze River, the people's courts in these areas have been successively established while destroying reactionary rule and establishing people's rule. Due to the rapid development of the revolutionary situation, we have not been able to universally establish working relationships with the people's courts in many newly liberated areas, and we do not have enough understanding of the court construction and work situation in these areas. Therefore, my report cannot explain the entire situation of the national court work, but only presents a general report on the situation of the courts in the old areas and some new areas to the conference for review and instruction.

  I. Overview of the Construction of People's Courts at All Levels

Because the liberation of various parts of the country occurred at different times, the establishment of people's courts in various places also occurred at different times, and the development of work is uneven. At present, people's courts have been almost universally established in North China and Northeast China, as well as in the old liberated areas of Northwest China, East China, and Central and South China. However, in many counties in the new areas, primarily due to limitations in cadre conditions, they have not been quickly established.

People's courts at all levels are established in accordance with administrative divisions. The principles for the organizational construction and ideological construction of the people's courts are based on Article 17 of the Common Program, which states: "Abolish all laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppressed the people, formulate laws and decrees to protect the people, and establish a people's judicial system." In establishing our people's courts, we first absorbed the 20 years of experience from the old liberated areas, and second, we learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Not only did we thoroughly smash the Kuomintang's anti-people judicial organs organizationally, but we also carried out a resolute struggle against the anti-people old "Six Codes" viewpoint ideologically, and established a truly people's court and a judicial system that serves the people on this basis. Regarding the trial methods and working systems of the people's courts, we abolished the old courts' judicial system of oppressing and fooling the people, established a judicial system that relies on the people, connects with the people, and facilitates the people, and adopted on-the-spot trials and circuit trials, mediation, and guidance of district and village mediation work, so that the courts face the masses and serve the masses. People's assessors have also been tried in some cases. In terms of litigation procedures, the cumbersome and slow litigation procedures of the old courts were abolished, and simple and easy litigation methods were implemented. Inquiry and writing offices were established in courts at all levels to help people solve difficulties and facilitate people's litigation.

In order to better serve the people, our Supreme People's Court recently established branches of the Supreme People's Court in the Northeast and Northwest Administrative Regions. The East China Branch is still under preparation, and branches will also be set up in the Central and South China and Southwest China regions. Each branch is the final instance organ in its respective region and represents the Supreme People's Court in supervising and leading the people's courts at all levels under its jurisdiction. In addition, in Beijing and Tianjin, in order to meet the needs of the work and to make the courts closer to the people and more convenient for the people, we are preparing to establish district people's courts directly under the leadership of the municipal people's courts to handle general civil and criminal first-instance cases. We are prepared to learn from experience so that we can gradually promote it to other major cities across the country.

At present, the number of civil and criminal cases in courts across the country is generally large. The biggest reason is that feudal remnants and the Kuomintang's reactionary rule for more than 20 years have created countless abscesses in society, which have gradually erupted after liberation, requiring the people's courts to resolve them. The large number of housing disputes in big cities and marriage cases in various places are examples. Therefore, most courts in various places have a large backlog of cases, and new cases continue to flood in before the old cases are cleared. When the Supreme People's Court was established last November, it received more than 1,280 civil and criminal cases transferred from the former North China People's Court. Then, a large number of second-instance appeals from North China provinces and Beijing and Tianjin successively poured in. This is because there are no second-instance appeal courts in Beijing and Tianjin. The shortage of cadres and the large number of cases in courts at all levels are the fundamental reasons for the backlog of cases in various places, but the backlog of cases must be actively cleared, so courts at all levels have now designated it as an urgent task.

  II. Current Tasks of the People's Court

Chairman Mao has clearly pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Our current task is to strengthen the people's state apparatus, which mainly refers to the people's army, the people's police, and the people's courts, to protect national defense and protect the interests of the people..." Article 7 of the Common Program also stipulates: "The People's Republic of China must suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, severely punish all Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war criminals and other incorrigible counter-revolutionary ringleaders who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause." At present, the situation of comprehensive construction in the new China has begun, and the task of consolidating the fruits of revolutionary victory and protecting the peaceful construction of the new China by the people's courts, one of the people's ruling weapons, has become even more important. Our people's courts carry out the country's political tasks through their own trial work. At present, the overriding central task in the old liberated areas is to restore and develop production, and the first task in the newly liberated areas is to eliminate bandits, secret agents, bullies, and other counter-revolutionary elements, and to carry out land reform in a planned and orderly manner. Combining the current political tasks of the old and new areas, the main tasks of our people's courts are:

First, resolutely, severely, promptly and timely suppress all counter-revolutionary activities and resistance from reactionary classes that undermine land reform, undermine production, and undermine the people's democratic construction, protect the victory of land reform, production construction, and democratic order. Chairman Mao's policy of combining suppression and leniency towards counter-revolutionary elements is also the policy of our people's courts in dealing with counter-revolutionary elements. All counter-revolutionary ringleaders must be severely suppressed, even to the point of the death penalty. In order to promptly and timely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, the power to review death sentences has been authorized by the Central Government to the branches of the Supreme People's Court or the people's governments of various provinces in major administrative regions. In areas where land reform is being implemented, the people's courts must closely cooperate with the people's tribunals to protect the legitimate struggle of the peasant masses, suppress the sabotage and resistance of illegal landlords to land reform, consolidate the land reform order, and ensure the victory of land reform.

Second, consolidate the unity within the people and adjust the relations within the people through trials. Adjust the relationship between public and private sectors and labor-capital relations based on the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital; protect the lawful implementation of the people's rights and obligations; consolidate families, and at the same time protect freedom of marriage. Resolutely struggle against all illegal elements that endanger production and disrupt revolutionary order, and give them necessary punishments. The people's courts adopt the principle of combining punishment and education in punishing general criminals, opposing both one-sided punitivism and one-sided "omnipotent education." Whether it is civil or criminal trial tasks, the purpose of educating the people and transforming society is always implemented. The role of coercion and punishment in our trials is consistent with the role of transformation and education. For criminals, not only are they passively punished, but they are also actively educated and transformed through trials and prison work, which serves as a condition to achieve the goal of warning bad elements in society and reducing crime.

Combining trial and education is not just a working method issue, but an important political task of our people's courts. The methods adopted by the people's courts in various places, such as public trials, collective trials, on-site trials, and circuit trials, have gained experience and achievements. In order to educate the people to know the law and abide by the law, we have used various forms, such as organizing newsletters, reports, radio broadcasts, speeches, storytelling, performances, wall newspapers, etc., to carry out propaganda and education work. The court's propaganda and education work is an important link in helping to promote laws and policies.

  III. Strengthening Cadres, Replenishing Institutions, and Strengthening Leadership

In order to further build people's courts and better carry out our work tasks, we believe that the important key lies in strengthening cadres, replenishing institutions, and strengthening leadership. At present, the common difficulties faced by courts at all levels are the large number of backlogged cases and too few cadres, especially in the grassroots organizations at the city and county levels. In the past and now, courts in various places have worked hard to clear the backlog of cases, which has partially alleviated the phenomenon of backlog. For example, Shanghai had 10,962 backlogged cases at the end of February this year. After a concentrated effort to clear the backlog of cases in March and April, there were still 6,733 backlogged cases at the end of April. In terms of the ratio of case acceptance, case conclusion, and cadres in Tianjin and Tangshan, Tianjin must handle an average of more than 80 cases per person per month, and Tangshan must handle 50 cases per person per month to achieve a balance between acceptance and conclusion, but this is difficult to achieve. The courts in various places, especially the courts of first instance, not only have fewer cadres, but also generally have low policy and business standards. The common demand of the people is that we handle cases well and quickly. Therefore, we must strengthen cadres, replenish institutions, and especially strengthen and replenish the courts of first instance, because they are in direct contact with the people. We hope that various places can help us solve this difficulty and appropriately transfer some cadres to work in the courts. At the same time, we should pay attention to the improvement of serving cadres and the training of new cadres.

Let's talk about the issue of leadership. In addition to their trial work within the scope of their trial level, the Supreme People's Court and its branches and the people's courts of various provinces are also responsible for supervising and leading the trial work of their subordinate courts. In accordance with the tasks stipulated in the Organic Law of the Central People's Government, in addition to the civil and criminal trial divisions carrying out trial work, the Supreme People's Court has also established supervision and guidance offices and compilation offices to conduct summary research on the policies and business of courts at all levels across the country, exchange experiences, and guide work. Since February this year, we have established a unified reporting system for courts at all levels across the country. In May, our court, together with the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Legislative Affairs Committee, and the Ministry of Justice, successively organized two inspection groups to inspect judicial work in Shenyang, Jilin, Songjiang, Liaodong, and the Lushun-Dalian area in Northeast China, and Tianjin, Tangshan, and Cangxian in North China. Recently, our court, together with the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Justice, and the Legislative Affairs Committee, are preparing to convene the first national judicial conference in order to understand the situation, summarize experience, and further improve judicial work.

In summary, we must overcome the current difficulties and work hard to achieve our tasks. I believe that we can achieve our goals under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao.

　　人民法院工作报告
    （一九五零年六月十七日  在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上的报告）
    沈钧儒主席，各位委员，各位先生：
    我们中央人民政府最高人民法院是去年十一月成立的。在这以前，华北、东北、以及西北、华东、中南部分老解放区早已有了地方性的各级人民法院，并从实际工作中培养了一批人民司法干部。他们创造和积累了建设人民法院的宝贵经验，以及和我们政权性质相适应的、切合人民实际需要的群众路线的工作方法和工作作风，这对于我们在全国范围内进一步建设人民法院和人民司法工作，提供了有利的条件。我们最高人民法院就是在这样的基础上建立起来的。半年以来，随着西北、西南和长江以南各省的完全解放，在摧毁了反动统治，树立起人民统治的同时，这些地区的人民法院也就陆续建立起来了。由于革命形势的迅速发展，我们还没有能够和许多新解放地区的人民法院普遍建立起工作上的联系，对于这些地区的法院建设情况和工作情况还了解得不够。因此，我的报告还不能说明全国法院工作的整个情况，而只就老区和某些新区关于法院的若干情况，提出来向大会作一个概略的报告，请求大会的审查和指示。
  一、各级人民法院建设概况
    由于全国各地的解放有先有后，各地人民法院的建立也就有早有晚，工作发展是不平衡的。就目前来说，华北和东北全区以及西北、华东、中南部分老区各省市县已经差不多普遍建立了人民法院，但新区各省还有不少县份，首先因为干部条件的限制，至今还没有很快建立起来。
    各级人民法院是依照行政区划设立的。关于人民法院的组织建设和思想建设的原则，是根据共同纲领第十七条的规定，那就是：“废除国民党反动政府一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度，制定保护人民的法律、法令，建立人民司法制度。”我们建立人民法院，首先是吸收了老解放区二十年来的经验，其次是学习了苏联和其他人民民主国家的先进的经验。不仅是从组织上彻底粉碎了国民党反人民的司法机构，而且在思想上，和反人民的旧“六法”观点进行了坚决的斗争，并在这个基础上建立起真正人民法院和为人民服务的司法制度。关于人民法院的审判方式和工作制度方面，废除了旧法院压迫人民，愚弄人民的司法制度，建立了依靠人民，联系人民，和便利人民的司法制度，采取了就地审判和巡回审判，调解和领导区村调解工作，使法院面向群众，为群众服务。某些案件并试行了人民陪审制。在诉讼程序上废除了旧法院繁琐迟滞的诉讼程序，实行了简捷易行的诉讼办法，各级法院设立了问事代书处，帮助人民解决困难，便利人民进行诉讼。
    为了更好地为人民服务，最近我们最高人民法院在东北和西北两大行政区设立最高人民法院分院，华东分院尚在筹备中，中南和西南地区亦将同样设置分院。各分院是各该地区的终审机关，并代表最高人民法院对管辖的各级人民法院，实施监督领导的责任。除此之外，我们在京津两市为了适应工作需要，和使法院更好地接近人民，便利人民，已准备设立区人民法院，直属于市人民法院的领导，办理一般民刑事第一审案件。我们准备吸取经验，以便有步骤地推行到全国其他各大城市。
    目前各地法院民刑事案件，一般讲来，数目都不少。最大原因是因为封建遗毒和国民党二十几年的反动统治在社会上造成了无数的脓疱，到了解放之后，渐渐爆发，向人民法院要求解决。即如大城市中房屋纠纷及各地婚姻案件之多，就是例证。因此各地法院大都积案甚多，旧案清理未完，新案又不断涌来。最高人民法院去年十一月成立时，就接收前华北人民法院移交下来的民刑事案件一千二百八十多件，接着华北各省和京津两市第二审上诉的案件又陆续大量涌到。这是由于京津两市没有第二审上诉法院的缘故。各级法院干部少，案件多，是目前各地造成积案的根本原因，但积案必须积极清理，所以各级法院现已把它定为当前急务。
  二、人民法院的当前任务
    毛主席在论人民民主专政中已经明白地指出了：“我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器，这主要地是指人民的军队，人民的警察和人民的法庭，借以保护国防和保护人民利益……”共同纲领第七条也规定着：“中华人民共和国必须镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子。”目前新中国全面建设的局面，已经开始，作为人民统治武器之一的人民法院，巩固革命胜利果实，保护新中国和平建设的任务，显得更加重要。我们人民法院是通过自己的审判工作来执行国家的政治任务的。目前老解放区压倒一切的中心任务是恢复和发展生产，新解放区首先肃清土匪、特务、恶霸及其他反革命分子，并有步骤有秩序地实行土地改革。综合老区和新区的当前政治任务，我们人民法院的主要任务是：
    第一、坚决地、严厉地、迅速及时地镇压一切破坏土地改革，破坏生产，破坏人民民主建设的反革命活动和反动阶级的反抗，保护土改胜利，生产建设，和民主秩序。毛主席所指示的对反革命分子的镇压和宽大相结合的政策，亦就是我们人民法院处理反革命分子的政策。一切反革命首恶分子必须给以严厉的镇压，直至处以死刑。为了迅速及时地镇压反革命活动，对于死刑复核，中央授权于各大行政区的最高人民法院分院或各省人民政府。人民法院在实行土改地区，必须与人民法庭密切配合，保障农民群众的合法斗争，镇压不法地主的破坏和抵抗土改的活动，巩固土改秩序，保证土改胜利。
    第二、通过审判，巩固人民内部的团结，调整人民内部的关系。根据公私兼顾劳资两利的原则，调整公私关系和劳资关系；保护人民权利义务的依法实行；巩固家庭，而同时保护婚姻自由。对危害生产，破坏革命秩序的一切不法分子，进行坚决的斗争，给以必要的惩罚。人民法院惩罚一般犯罪分子是采取惩罚与教育相结合的原则，既反对片面的惩办主义，也反对片面的“教育万能”。无论民事和刑事的审判任务，总是贯彻着教育人民改造社会的目的。我们审判上的强制和惩罚的作用是和改造教育的作用一致的。对于犯罪分子，不只是消极地惩罚，而且积极地通过审判，通过监狱工作，加以教育改造，以此作为条件，达到警戒社会不良分子，减少犯罪的目的。
    审判和教育结合，这不仅是一个工作方法问题，而是我们人民法院的一个重要的政治工作任务。我们各地人民法院所采取的公审、集体审讯、就地审判、巡回审判等方式，已经获得了经验和成绩。为了教育人民知法守法，我们运用了各种不同的形式，如组织通讯报导、广播、讲演、说书、演唱、墙报等，以进行宣传教育工作。法院的宣传教育工作，是帮助法令政策推行的一个重要的环节。
  三、加强干部、充实机构、加强领导
    为了进一步建设人民法院，更好地执行我们的工作任务，我们认为重要的关键，在于加强干部，充实机构，和加强领导。目前各级法院普遍的困难是积案多而干部太少，特别是市县一级基层组织更为严重。过去和现在，各地法院都曾努力进行了清理积案工作，部分地减轻了积案现象。例如上海今年二月底有积案一○九六二件，经过了三、四月份的突击清理积案，到四月底积案尚有六七三三件。天津和唐山就其收案、结案和干部比例来说，天津必须每月每人平均办案八十余件，唐山每月每人办案五十件，才能收结平衡，但这是难以做到的。而各地法院，特别是第一审法院不仅是干部少，而且一般说来，政策和业务水准是低的。而人民的共同要求，是要我们办得好，办得快。所以我们必须加强干部，充实机构，而尤其应该加强充实第一审法院，因为它是直接接触人民的。我们希望各地能帮助我们解决这个困难，酌调一部分干部到法院工作。同时我们应注重在职干部的提高和新干部的培养。
    再说领导问题。最高人民法院及其分院和各省人民法院，除了其审级范围内的审判工作外，还对其所属下级法院的审判工作负有监督领导的责任。最高人民法院根据中央人民政府组织法规定的任务，除了民刑事审判庭进行审判工作外，并建立督导处和编纂处的机构，进行关于全国各级法院的政策和业务的总结研究，交流经验，指导工作。今年二月起，我们建立了全国各级法院统一的报告制度。五月间本院曾与最高人民检察署、法制委员会和司法部先后组织了两个视察团，出发到东北的沈阳、吉林、松江、辽东、和旅大地区及华北的天津、唐山、沧县等地视察司法工作。最近本院与最高人民检察署、司法部、及法制委员会四个机关筹备召开第一次全国司法会议，以便了解情况，总结经验，把司法工作进一步提高。
    总括起来，我们必须克服目前的困难，努力工作，以实现我们的任务。我相信我们在毛主席直接领导下，是能够达到目的的。
