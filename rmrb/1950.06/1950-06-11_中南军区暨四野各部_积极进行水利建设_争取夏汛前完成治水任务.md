Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 9th. The Central-South Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and units of the Fourth Field Army are actively carrying out various water conservancy projects, striving to complete the water control tasks before the summer flood season. The water conservancy projects undertaken by the Central-South Region troops include the old Han River levee south of Zhongxiang in Hubei, the Xiao Zhanggong levee in Hankou, the Hefeng polder in the eastern suburbs of Changsha in Hunan, and the Shuikou Dam in Huiyang, Guangdong. Troops stationed in Henan are also cooperating with local people to participate in dredging the Ying River, Qingyi River (Shiliang River, a tributary of the Ying River), and Shuangbo River, which have been harmful for more than ten years. Except for the old Han River levee and the Ying and Qingyi Rivers, the embankments in other places have been completed. After the restoration of the Shuikou Dam in Huiyang, Guangdong, 18,000 residents will be able to avoid the harm of floods. After the completion of the Hefeng polder in the eastern suburbs of Changsha, Hunan, it is expected that the annual output will increase by 300,000 shi of rice, 30,000 dan of vegetables, and more than 10,000 jin of fish. After the restoration of the old Han River levee, 350,000 mu of swamp will be turned into fertile land.

Before starting the construction project, the commanders and fighters first investigated the origin of the disaster and the water disaster situation over the years, and heard the residents' indignant exposure of the Kuomintang reactionary rulers' deliberate creation of water disasters. This greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the commanders and fighters participating in the water conservancy construction project. They built shacks in the desolate disaster area and on the dilapidated dikes. Regardless of the continuous rain or the scorching sun, the commanders and fighters worked as hard as if they were completing a combat mission. The various units launched a labor competition to create records. In the 24-day river excavation project of a certain unit, the two groups created new records every day, increasing the amount of earth dug per person per day from 3 cubic meters to 9.3 cubic meters. The labor enthusiasm of the commanders and fighters deeply moved the masses along the river and also inspired their enthusiasm. Guo Zhenxi, an old river worker who had worked on the Ying River for more than 40 years, originally held a negative attitude towards river management, but later, under the positive influence of the soldiers, he enthusiastically provided opinions on river management and completely changed his past attitude.

Now, the commanders and fighters active on the water conservancy construction front are working with redoubled efforts to complete the planned water control tasks before the summer flood season.

    中南军区暨四野各部
    积极进行水利建设
    争取夏汛前完成治水任务
    【新华社汉口九日电】人民解放军中南军区和第四野战军各部正积极进行各项水利建设，争取在夏汛前完成治水任务。中南区部队担负修筑的水利工程，计有湖北钟祥以南的汉水旧堤，汉口小张公堤，湖南长沙东郊的合丰垸，及广东惠阳水口坝等处。驻河南各部亦协同当地民众，参加疏浚为害十余年的颍河、青潩河（石梁河、颍河支流）、双泊河。上述工程除汉水旧堤及颍河、青潩河外，各处堤防均已修竣。广东惠阳水口坝修复后，可使一万八千居民避免洪水的危害。湖南长沙东郊的合丰垸完工后，预计每年可增产三十万石稻谷、三万担菜蔬和万余斤鱼。汉水旧堤修复后，可使三十五万亩泽国变为良田。
    指战员们在开始修建工程前，首先调查了灾害的起源和历年水患的情况，听到了居民们愤慨地揭发的国民党反动统治者蓄意制造水灾的罪恶。这大大激发了参加水利建设工程的指战员们的热情。他们在荒凉的灾区和残破的堤上，搭起了窝棚。指战员们不顾霪雨连绵或烈日炎炎，都像完成战斗任务一样紧张地工作。各部相互间展开了创造纪录的劳动竞赛。某部的两个组在二十四天的挖河工程中，每日都互相创造新的纪录，使每人每日挖土量从三立方公尺，提高到九点三立方公尺。指战员们的劳动热忱，深深地感动了沿河的群众，也激发了他们的积极性。一个曾在颍河工作四十多年的老河工郭振喜，本来对治河抱着消极态度，后来在战士们的积极影响下，也热情地提供治河的意见，完全改变了过去的态度。
    现在，活跃在水利建设的战线上的指战员们，正以加倍的努力，争取在夏汛以前完成预定的治水任务。
