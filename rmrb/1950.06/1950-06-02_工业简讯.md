　　The workers of the Anqing Alcohol Factory in Anhui Province have successfully改造改建 a continuous still, potentially doubling production. Previously, the factory, lacking steam boiler equipment, used batch stills to produce alcohol, which hindered production increases and resulted in higher costs. After research and experimentation by the factory's laboratory staff, utilizing the hot water discharged from the condenser and the waste liquid discharged from the boiler to preheat the cold wine twice (to approximately 60 degrees Celsius) before entering the tower for continuous distillation, production doubled. Manpower was reduced by one-third, and firewood consumption decreased by over 43%. This also broke the conservative views of technical personnel and overcame the difficulties of not having foundry machinery. (Zhou Shufan)
　　Counties within the Shijiazhuang Prefecture along the railway line are once again assisting the Zhengzhou Railway Administration in collecting railway materials. According to statistics from five counties up to the end of April, a total of 423 steel rails, 454 track spikes, 83 joint bars, 33 fishplates, and 405 other useful and important materials were collected. (Wang Lu)
　　All the staff of the Kouquan Station on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway utilized their spare time to collect materials in large quantities. From May 2nd to 8th, they collected 16 types of telecommunications materials, 5 types of locomotive materials, 13 types of track maintenance materials, and 16 types of non-railway materials and scrap iron, totaling over 700 pieces. The estimated value is equivalent to over 30,000 catties of millet.

　　The Zhangjiakou Waterworks Company discovered a large quantity of useful materials while clearing scrap iron piles. The factory's material warehouse had already been thoroughly cleaned last year. On April 15th of this year, under the leadership of the Warehouse Material Clearing Committee, a careful inspection of the scrap iron piled in the yard was conducted. As a result, 114 types of water and heating equipment, totaling 873 pieces and equivalent to 9,875 catties of millet, were cleared out. They also cleared out 58 pieces of large and small copper gate valves that are currently urgently needed.

    安徽安庆酒精厂职工，改造连续蒸馏器成功，产量可能提高一倍。该厂过去因无蒸汽锅炉设备，采用间断蒸馏器制造酒精，以致产量无法提高，且成本较高。经该厂化验室职工研究试验，利用分凝器排去的热水及锅炉内排去的废液，将冷酒先行预热两次（约摄氏六○度），再行入塔蒸馏实行连续蒸馏后，产量提高一倍，人力节省三分之一，柴火节省百分之四十三强。并且打破了技术人员的保守观点，克服了没有翻砂机件的困难。（周树藩）
