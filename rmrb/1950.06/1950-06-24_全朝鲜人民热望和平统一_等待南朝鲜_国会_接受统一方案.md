　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 23rd: Kang Liang-uk, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stated in a conversation on the 21st that after the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued its decision on promoting the peaceful reunification of the country on the 19th, it broadcasted it to the South Korean "National Assembly" dozens of times. The entire Korean people are waiting for a response, but three days have passed without receiving a reply from the South Korean "National Assembly," and it is unknown whether the decision has been submitted for discussion. All South Korean newspapers and radio stations, under the instructions of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, are keeping silent about the decision of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly. However, no matter how the Syngman Rhee bandit gang struggles, they cannot block the Korean people's call to respond to the decision of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly. The Korean people are waiting for the South Korean "National Assembly" to discuss the decision of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly. I hope that the true patriots among the South Korean "National Assembly members" who favor the peaceful reunification of the motherland will demand the acceptance of this decision in the South Korean "National Assembly."
　　Xinhua News Agency report: Pyongyang dispatch: Leaders of various democratic parties and social organizations in Korea have successively issued statements in recent days, calling on the so-called "middle-of-the-road" members of the South Korean puppet "National Assembly," which opened on the 19th, to bring the Fatherland Front's plan for peaceful reunification to the National Assembly for discussion. The statements unanimously pointed out that the Korean people's attitude towards those so-called "middle-of-the-road members" will depend on their own performance.

　　全朝鲜人民热望和平统一
    等待南朝鲜“国会”接受统一方案
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会书记长康良煜于二十一日发表谈话称：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会于十九日发表关于促进国家和平统一的决定后，曾向南朝鲜的“国会”广播了数十次。全朝鲜人民都在等待着答复，但到现在已过三天，尚未接到南朝鲜“国会”的答复，不知是否已将该项决定提付讨论。南朝鲜的所有报刊和广播电台，在李承晚匪帮的指示下，对最高人民会议常任委员会的决定保持沉默。但是，不管李承晚匪帮怎样挣扎，也无法堵塞朝鲜人民响应最高人民会议常任委员会的决定的呼声。朝鲜人民在等待着南朝鲜“国会”讨论最高人民会议常任委员会的决定。我期望南朝鲜“国会议员”中赞成祖国和平统一的真正爱国者，一定要在南朝鲜“国会”上要求接受这一决定。
    【新华社讯】平壤消息：朝鲜各民主政党、社会团体的领袖日来相继发表声明，号召于十九日开幕的南朝鲜伪“国会”中的所谓“中间派议员”在国会上提出祖国战线的和平统一方案来讨论。声明中一致指出：朝鲜人民对于那些所谓“中间派议员”的态度，将视他们自己的表现而定。
