　　"New China Women" Publishes Short Article
    Calling on Women in Various Regions to Participate in Summer Agricultural Production
    [This Newspaper News] The All-China Democratic Women's Federation's publication "New China Women" monthly, in its recently published issue No. 12, published a short article titled "Extensively Mobilize Women to Participate in Summer Agricultural Production." It calls on women's federations in various regions to mobilize and organize women to participate in summer agricultural production. The short article explains that the success of summer agricultural production work is greatly related to the annual agricultural income, especially in disaster areas where manpower and animal power have been weakened, and spring planting has been rough, it is even more necessary to use multiple hoeings to remedy this. Experience has proven that mobilizing women to participate in summer production can solve the difficulty of labor shortage and complete tasks such as wheat harvesting, summer planting, and summer weeding in a timely manner. Therefore, women's federations in various regions should regard mobilizing and organizing women to participate in summer agricultural production as an important task at present. Urban women's federations should also allocate considerable resources to lead women in suburban areas to participate in summer agricultural production. The short article points out that when mobilizing women to participate in production in various regions, it is necessary to put forward different requirements based on different situations, mobilize women to participate in all possible labor as much as possible, and organize women without skills to learn from skilled farmers. Secondly, propaganda and education should be strengthened to explain the benefits of women participating in summer harvesting, summer planting, and summer weeding. In new areas, education on the glory of labor should also be strengthened to improve women's understanding of production. In addition, women should be appropriately organized according to their skills, physical strength, and household labor, and labor should be adjusted; such as organizing labor exchange for harvesting and sowing, and labor exchange for field labor and household labor. However, the principles of voluntariness, mutual benefit, and equivalent exchange must be adhered to when organizing. The faults of coercion, commandism, and formalism must be corrected. When checking the achievements of women's organization, do not be satisfied with the number of production groups, but look at the actual effect after organization. At the same time, women's federations in various regions must closely cooperate with the local people's government and leading production organs. Especially in old areas, the production leading organs of districts and villages should absorb district and village women cadres, female labor heroes, and female production models as much as possible, so that they can understand the overall situation and assist the leaders in mobilizing women to participate in production. In labor exchange teams and production groups jointly organized by men and women, attention should be paid to promoting active women to participate in leadership, so that it is easier to reflect women's opinions, so as to take care of women's special interests and further improve their production enthusiasm.
    In mobilizing women to participate in summer production, it is also necessary to conduct thrift education for the masses of women and draw the masses' attention to preventing new disasters.

　　《新中国妇女》发表短论
    号召各地妇女参加夏季农业生产
    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会的机关刊物《新中国妇女》月刊，在最近出刊的第十二期上，以“广泛发动妇女参加夏季农业生产”为题发表短论。号召各地妇联发动并组织妇女参加夏季农业生产。短论说明：夏季农业生产工作的好坏与全年农产收入关系很大，特别是在灾区，因人力、畜力减弱，春种粗糙，更要用多锄来补救。经验证明，发动妇女参加了夏季生产，就能解决劳力缺乏的困难，及时完成麦收、夏种，夏锄等任务。为此，各地妇联应把发动与组织妇女参加夏季农业生产作为目前的重要任务。城市妇联也应拿出相当的力量领导城郊妇女参加夏季农业生产。短论指出：各地发动妇女参加生产时，必须根据不同的情况，提出不同的要求，尽量动员妇女参加一切可能参加的劳动，并组织没有技术的妇女向有技术的农民学习。其次，应加强宣传教育，说明妇女参加夏收、夏种、夏锄的好处，在新区还应加强劳动光荣的教育，提高妇女对生产的认识。此外，要根据妇女的技术、体力及家庭劳作的情况，适当地组织起来，调剂劳动力；如组织收割与下种锄地的变工，地里劳动和家庭劳作的变工等。但进行组织时，一定要坚持自愿两利，等价交换的原则。必须纠正强迫命令、形式主义的毛病。在检查妇女组织起来的成绩时，不要只满足于生产小组的数字多少，要看组织起来后的实际效果。同时，各地妇联必须与当地人民政府及领导生产机关密切配合。特别在老区，区村的生产领导机构应尽可能吸收区村妇女干部、女劳动英雄、女生产模范参加，使她们了解整个情况，协助领导上发动妇女参加生产。在男女共同组织的变工队及生产小组中，应注意提拔积极的妇女参加领导，使更易于反映妇女意见，以便照顾妇女的特殊利益，更加提高她们的生产热情。
    在发动妇女参加夏季生产中，同时要对妇女群众进行节约教育及引起群众注意防止新的灾荒。
