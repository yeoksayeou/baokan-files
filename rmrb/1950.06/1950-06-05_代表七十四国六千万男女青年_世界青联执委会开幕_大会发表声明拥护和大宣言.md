　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch: The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, representing 60 million young men and women from 74 countries around the world, opened in Berlin on May 31st.

　　At the first day's meeting, Erich Honecker, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Free German Youth League, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the German democratic youth. Honecker pointed out that, according to information he had received, in the past two days, thousands of participants of the All-German Youth Congress had been arrested by the British occupation authorities upon returning to West Germany. The Executive Committee expressed its deep indignation at this new act of violence by the British occupation authorities. The Executive Committee decided to send a telegram of protest to British High Commissioner for Germany, Robertson.

　　The meeting then adopted the following agenda: 1. The tasks of democratic youth in further participating in the movement to defend peace; 2. The tasks of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in the struggle to consolidate the ranks of democratic youth worldwide; 3. Progress in the preparation for the conference on child welfare and democratic education.

　　In the second and third day’s meetings, the Executive Committee discussed the report by World Federation of Democratic Youth President Bauer on "The tasks of democratic youth in further participating in the peace movement."

　　Representatives of youth from fifteen countries reported on the situation of youth in their respective countries participating in the campaign to collect signatures for the World Peace Congress Standing Committee declaration.

　　Polish representative Morawski reported that 16 million people in Poland, or more than 90 percent of the total population, had signed the declaration. German representative Honecker declared that 16.8 million signatures had been collected throughout Germany, of which 8 million were collected by young people. Brazilian representative Gastiel stated that 370,000 people nationwide in Brazil had stood up to support the declaration, of whom 300,000 were young men and women. French representative Tenier stated that more than 7 million signatures had been collected in France. In many French towns, soldiers also signed the declaration.

　　During the discussion, the Executive Committee put forward many concrete suggestions for mobilizing more young people to participate in the peace movement. British representative William Bullock mentioned the need to more widely publicize the achievements of the Soviet Union in the struggle for peace and the role it plays in defending the peace and security of all countries. Free Austrian Youth representative Walter-Breisky proposed organizing a "peace relay race." German representative Honecker declared that the youth organizations of Berlin, Paris, and Rome had launched a friendly competition to collect the most signatures for the Stockholm Declaration. Honecker also suggested that the organizations affiliated with the World Federation of Democratic Youth expand the scale of exchanging experiences of young people participating in the peace movement.

　　At the conclusion of the discussion on the first item on the agenda, all participants of the Executive Committee meeting issued a statement, announcing their full support for the World Peace Congress Standing Committee Declaration and signing the declaration.
