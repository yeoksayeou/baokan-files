　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: The large-scale spring river management and water conservancy project in northern Jiangsu this year was completed successively from May to early June. The entire project, in addition to the first phase of the Yi River diversion project, includes coastal dike repair and reclamation projects, Yangtze River dike restoration projects, key embankment reinforcement projects along the Grand Canal, and dredging projects for various inland rivers. It mobilized a total of one million laborers, completing 54.7 million cubic meters of earthwork and 400,000 cubic meters of stonework. The completion of these projects will not only spare 5.5 million mu of grain fields and over 2 million mu of cotton fields in northern Jiangsu, which were often flooded in previous years, from water disasters but also expand cotton fields by 940,000 mu in coastal areas. The 22 million mu of farmland along the Grand Canal and the Yangtze River will also have the threat of flooding reduced. Thanks to the correct implementation of the principle of combining river management with disaster relief by the People's Government, using the work-for-relief method to organize disaster victims to repair rivers, and using all 245.56 million catties of rice in project funds for disaster victims, the severe spring famine in northern Jiangsu this year was overcome. During the construction period, all the laborers and their 2 million family members were able to solve their food problems with the wages they earned.
　　The coastal dike repair and reclamation project started in early March this year and ended in early May. It included reinforcing the Yun Dyke, which stretches 500 li north and south from Lianxing Port (Qidong County) to Jiaoxie (Hai'an County); newly constructing 33 kilometers of sea dikes in the territory of Taipei County (newly established county, northern Dongtai County); and dredging 46 kilometers of the Second, Third, and Fourth Mao You Rivers, totaling 3.72 million cubic meters of earthwork. The Yangtze River dike restoration project covered 900 li, and the key reinforcement of the Grand Canal embankments covered 600 li. The above were undertaken in sections by various special districts and were completed by the end of May. In addition, Nantong Special District dredged 42 major rivers within the district, and over 70,000 laborers in Qidong, Haimen, and other counties excavated 436 small drainage rivers and over 4,490 ditches, and repaired 277 river embankments. Huaiyin Special District, while starting the Yi River diversion project, completed the 600,000 cubic meter earth excavation project of the Wutu River in Guanyun County, and the 80 li of drainage channels from the south of the Xinyi River dike and east of Shuyang City to the Yan River. Yancheng Special District completed the straightening project of the main drainage channel, the Xinyang Port, and the excavation project of the Tangyu River within its territory.
　　During the entire spring repair project construction period, the Central People's Government specially dispatched an epidemic prevention team to treat the diseases of the laborers and sent a photography team to film this great project. Leading personnel from the Party and government at all levels in northern Jiangsu and Qian Zhengying, Deputy Minister of the Water Conservancy Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, personally went to the construction sites to supervise and guide. During the construction, millions of laborers demonstrated a high degree of perseverance and tenacious working spirit. They waged a serious struggle against difficulties such as rain, silt, and flowing sand, so that the spring repair plan for river management in the entire region was finally completed as scheduled.

　　苏北完成巨大春修工程
    七百万亩粮田和棉田免除水患  沿海地区棉田扩大九十四万亩
    【新华社上海十六日电】苏北地区今年规模巨大的春季治河水利工程，已于五月至六月上旬先后完工。全部工程除第一期导沂（河）工程外，包括沿海修堤兴垦工程、长江复堤工程、运河河堤重点培修工程及各内河疏浚工程等，动员民工共达一百万人，完成土工五千四百七十万公方，石工四十万公方。这些工程的完成，不仅可使苏北地区往年常受水淹的五百五十万亩粮田及二百余万亩棉田免除水患；并扩大了沿海地区棉田九十四万亩。运河两岸及沿江二千二百万亩田地，亦因此减轻了水患的威胁。由于人民政府正确地执行了治河结合救灾的方针，用以工代赈方式组织灾民修河，将全部工程费二亿四千五百六十万斤大米均用于灾民，苏北区今年的严重春荒得以度过。施工期中，全部民工和二百万民工家属均靠所得的工资粮解决了口粮。
    沿海修堤兴垦工程系自今年三月初旬开工，至五月上旬结束。计培修了连星港（启东县境）至角斜（海安县境）南北五百华里的云堤；新筑成台北县（新设县、东台县北部）境海堤三十三公里；疏浚了二、三、四卯酉河四十六公里，以上共计土工三百七十二万公方。长江复堤计九百华里，运河河堤重点培修计六百华里。以上由各专署分段负责，均已于五月底完成。此外，南通专区疏浚了区内四十二条主要河道，启东、海门等县七万余民工开挖排水小河四百三十六条、水沟四千四百九十多条，修河堤二百七十七条。淮阴专区在导治沂河工程开始同时，完成了灌云县境五图河六十万公方的挖土工程，和新沂河堤南、沭阳城东到盐河的八十华里的排水河道。盐城专区完成了境内排水主干新洋港的裁弯取直工程，和唐豫河的开掘工程。
    全部春修工程施工期中，中央人民政府特派防疫队，为民工治疗疾病，并派摄影队将此伟大工程摄成影片。苏北各级党、政负责人员及华东军政委员会水利部钱正英副部长均曾亲赴工地监督指导。施工中百万民工表现了高度坚毅顽强的工作精神，他们不屈不挠地与雨水、淤泥、淌沙等困难作了严重的斗争，使全区治河的春修计划终于如期完成。
