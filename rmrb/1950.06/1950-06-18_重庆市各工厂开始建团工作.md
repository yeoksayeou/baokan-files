　　Chongqing Factories
    Start League Building Work
    [This Newspaper] Chongqing Municipality: Factories in Chongqing have begun League building work. The city has a total of 250,000 workers, of whom about 100,000 are young workers. In order to carry out the work of young workers, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Youth League sent cadres to various factories and held a youth worker training class at the 21st Arsenal, absorbing 347 young male and female workers from seven larger factories for three weeks of study. After preliminary class education and League building education, more than 90 percent of the young workers who participated in the study requested to join the Youth League. The factories then began League building work, successively establishing fourteen branches and absorbing more than 370 advanced young people into the League. At the same time, League building has also begun among store employees in the city's finance, books, department stores, and paint industries. Most of the young people who have joined the League are able to actively produce and study hard. League building work has attracted the attention of various factories. At present, the League organization is developing rapidly.

　　重庆市各工厂
    开始建团工作
    【本报讯】重庆市各工厂已开始建团工作。该市共有工人二十五万，其中青年工人约十万名。青年团重庆市工委会为开展青年工人工作，曾派干部分赴各厂，并在二十一兵工厂举办了青工训练班，吸收七个较大工厂三百四十七名男女青年工人学习了三个星期。经过初步的阶级教育和建团教育后，百分之九十以上参加学习的青年工人都要求加入青年团。各厂即开始了建团工作，先后建立了十四个支部，吸收了三百七十余名先进青年入团。同时，在该市金融、图书、百货、颜料等行业店员中，也已开始建团。已入团的青年大多能积极生产，努力学习。建团工作已引起各工厂的重视。目前团的组织正在迅速发展中。
