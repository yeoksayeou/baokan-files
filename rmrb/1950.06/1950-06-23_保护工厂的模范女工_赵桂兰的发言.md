Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: Zhao Guilan, a model female worker for protecting the factory, delivered the following speech at the second meeting of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 21st:

　　Chairman, esteemed members, esteemed representatives:

　　I am an ordinary female worker, and it is a great honor to be able to participate in such a grand meeting today. I fully support the reports of Chairman Mao and the leading comrades of the Central People's Government, especially Vice Chairman Liu's report on land reform and Vice Premier Chen's report on financial and economic issues. These are all issues related to the interests of our people nationwide. Our female workers, together with our male workers, will strive to produce, improve our skills, launch production competitions, and create all kinds of new records to support the thorough implementation of these reports.

　　Although I was injured while loving labor and loving the property of the motherland, and became disabled, my mind has not been disabled. Therefore, I am not discouraged at all. Under the leadership and assistance of the Lushun-Dalian People's Government, I am working hard to improve my cultural and knowledge level so that I can contribute all my small strength to the construction of the motherland and strive to build the Northeast into an advanced base for industrialized China. Strive to assist the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and Tibet.

　　I sincerely wish Chairman Mao good health! Good health to all members and representatives!

    赵桂兰的发言
    【新华社二十一日讯】保护工厂的模范女工赵桂兰二十一日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言全文如下：主席，诸位委员，诸位代表先生：
    我是一个普通的女工，今天能参加这样的大会，实在光荣。我完全拥护毛主席和中央人民政府各位首长的报告，特别是刘副主席关于土地改革和陈副总理关于财政经济问题的报告，这些都是关系我们全国人民利益的问题。我们女工们与男工们一道，将以努力生产，提高技术，展开生产竞赛，创造各种各样的新纪录行动，来拥护这些报告的彻底施行。
    我虽是由于热爱劳动，和热爱祖国的财产负了伤，成了残废，但我的思想并未残废，因此我一点也不灰心。我正在旅大人民政府领导和帮助下努力的提高文化，提高知识水平，以便把自己微小的力量，全部贡献给祖国的建设事业，为把东北迅速建设成为工业化中国的前进基地而奋斗。为援助人民解放军，解放台湾、西藏而奋斗。
    我谨祝毛主席身体健康！诸位委员、诸位代表先生身体健康！
