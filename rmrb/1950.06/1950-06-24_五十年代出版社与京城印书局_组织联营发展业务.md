　　Fifties Publishing House and Jingcheng Printing Bureau
    Organize Joint Venture to Develop Business
    [Our Newspaper News] Correspondent Liming reports: The private Fifties Publishing House and the Jingcheng Printing Bureau in Beijing have pooled manpower, capital, machinery, and equipment to organize a joint venture, resolving the difficulties of the Jingcheng Printing Bureau, which was short of printing work and suffering from excessive losses, enabling the business to be maintained. The factory's labor-management consultation meeting has also initially established various systems and will proceed to formulate production plans and labor discipline.
    The Jingcheng Printing Bureau is a factory in Beijing with sound machinery and equipment, sufficient printing capacity, and relatively good worker skills. However, in recent months, printing business has been sluggish, averaging only about thirty reams of paper printed per month, far from the company's production capacity (printing three hundred reams of paper). The average monthly income was just over 1,000 jin of millet, while expenses were 7,800 jin, resulting in business losses. By the end of April, it owed more than 70 million yuan in external debts. In early May, the factory manager once applied to the Labor Bureau to cease operations and lay off all workers. After the joint venture with the Fifties Publishing House, the production organization was adjusted, and only seven redundant employees were laid off. The Fifties Publishing House also helped to clear 50 million yuan of external debt and paid the arrears for the first half of May, especially solving the bureau's lack of work, allowing the business to be maintained.
    The Fifties Publishing House has relatively sufficient funds and normal business operations, publishing more than 20 kinds of books itself, so printing work is not a problem. However, the publishing house's printing machinery is old and the printing capacity is insufficient, printing less than two and a half reams of paper per day. Some printing work often needs to be contracted out, and all binding is also handled by outsiders, which affects the increase in costs. Therefore, the business also suffered losses from January to April. In addition, the lease on the publishing house's rented premises has expired, and the landlord is about to take it back. The joint venture not only solved the factory site problem but also greatly increased printing capacity due to improved machinery and equipment, with an estimated monthly printing capacity of 120 to 150 reams of paper. After the joint venture, the publishing house has various types of typesetting in Chinese, Russian, and English, and can completely handle its own editing, printing, and binding, which will reduce expenses and lower costs. The two companies now have a total of sixty employees, sufficient printing capacity, and have the full conditions for development.
    On June 10, the labor-management sides each selected five representatives to form a labor-management consultation meeting, which adopted various systems such as working hours, salary payment time, sick leave, medical care, and borrowing. Now both sides are negotiating to formulate production plans and labor discipline.

　　五十年代出版社与京城印书局
    组织联营发展业务
    【本报讯】通讯员黎明报导：京私营五十年代出版社与京城印书局集中人力、资金、机器设备组织联营，解决了京城印书局缺少印活、亏累过甚的困难，使营业得以维持。该厂劳资协商会议并已初步规定了各项制度，将进而制订生产计划和劳动纪律。
    京城印书局是京市机器设备健全、有充分印刷能力、工人技术较好的一个工厂。但近几个月来，印务清淡，平均每月仅能印三十多令纸，距该社具有的生产能力（印三百令纸）相差很远，每月平均收入小米一千多斤，开支七千八百多斤，营业亏累，到四月底共拖欠外债七千多万元。该厂经理五月初曾一度向劳动局申请停业，要解雇全部工人。与五十年代出版社联营后，调整了生产组织，仅解雇了多余的七名职工。五十年代出版社并代为清理了五千万元的外债，开付了五月上半月的欠资，特别是解决了该局缺活的困难，使营业可以维持。
    五十年代出版社资金比较充足，业务正常，自己出版有书籍二十多种，印活不成问题。但该社印厂机器较老，印刷能力不足，每天印不出两令半纸，一部分印活常需找人承印，装订也全部交外人承办，影响成本增高，故一月到四月份营业亦有亏损。此外，该社所租房屋已到期，房主行将收回。联营后不但解决了厂址问题，且因健全了机器设备，印刷能力大大增加，预计每月可印刷一二○令至一五○令纸。联营后该社具有中文、俄文、英文等各种排字，并可完全由自己编排、印刷、装订，将使开支减少，成本降低。现两社共有职工六十人，印刷能力充足，具备了充分的发展条件。
    六月十日该厂劳资双方各选派代表五人组成了劳资协商会议，通过了工时、工资发放时间、病假、医疗、借支等各项制度。现在双方正协商制订生产计划和劳动纪律中。
