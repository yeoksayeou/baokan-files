　　"Sea Storm" Tempered Forty-Two People's Fighters
　　　　Shi Lei

　　The forty-two People's Fighters from the "Sea Storm" have been back for more than four months. After being attacked by storms at sea and on isolated islands, harassed by the enemy, and tormented by hunger, they are like trees that have endured cold and frost, tempered to be even stronger.

　　The half-month of life on the island, from a time perspective, is not very long. However, the vivid fact of "sharing the same boat" told each comrade: "Unity is strength." Now, this experience has had a huge impact on them. The friendly relations between them have been strengthened, and the initiative of each comrade has also been greatly enhanced.

　　Squad Leader Dan Yide used to be impatient and quick to anger when educating comrades. But after being tempered by the "Sea Storm," he changed his leadership style and conducted a self-criticism to the whole squad. Now, the squad is as loving and united as brothers. The soldiers unanimously praised: "Squad Leader Dan has changed! He's at the forefront of work and discusses things with everyone."

　　After returning, Deputy Squad Leader Li Hongbin of the first squad was assigned to the sixth squad as squad leader. He originally had a nickname called "Grandma," and now he seems even more deserving of it. He treats comrades and the work of the squad like a mother in a family, taking care of everything. He is a model communist, working conscientiously and treating people warmly. When Little Yang in the platoon was sick, Squad Leader Li brought water and food during the day, asking about his well-being. At night, as soon as he heard Little Yang move, he would ask: "Little Yang, do you want hot water?" "Are you cold? I'll give you my cotton coat to cover yourself..."

　　Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang, who drifted at sea for four days and four nights, had his legs frostbitten and has not yet recovered. After returning, he was transferred to the seventh company as platoon leader and is very responsible in his work. All the soldiers in the platoon proposed: "Learn from Platoon Leader Zhang's spirit of hard work!"

　　After half a month of island life, they have a greater understanding of the importance of uniting the masses, relying on the masses, and helping the masses. Now they often consciously and automatically help the local people carry water and hoe the fields. They also donated 29,000 yuan to help an old woman who had not eaten for two days. This incident caused a sensation in the whole village. The masses also loved them even more, and they all volunteered to wash their clothes and sew their clothes...

　　After returning, the Party, superiors, leaders, comrades, and the people came to express their sympathy one after another. They felt unspeakable warmth and glory.

　　"How can we repay the Party, superiors, comrades, and the people for their care and love?" This question is strongly stimulating their revolutionary heroism of dedicating themselves to the people's cause: "We must quickly improve our skills, liberate Taiwan, and make new contributions for the people!"

　　They asked their superiors to participate in military training as soon as possible and made a guarantee: "Be exemplary in everything! Take the lead in everything!" "Practice hard what we don't know, and become proficient in what we already know." In January and February, their platoon got up every day before dawn and went to the company's assembly ground to practice on the horizontal bar, vaulting horse, and obstacle course. Their hands developed blisters, which broke and then formed blood blisters, eventually becoming a hard piece of dead skin, and their fleshy hands became "iron hands."

　　The forty-two People's Fighters are rapidly progressing through the cultivation of the Party, the help of brotherly units, and the tempering of the "Sea Storm." They will advance to Taiwan with brotherly units to wipe out the remnant bandits.

　　“海上风暴”锻炼了四十二位人民战士
    石磊
    “海上风暴”中的四十二位人民战士，回来已经四个多月了。他们经过海中和孤岛上风暴的侵袭，敌人的困扰，饥饿的熬煎等等考验，好似经过寒冷、风霜的树木，锻炼得更坚强了。
    岛上半个月的生活，从时间上看来并不算长。可是“同舟共济”的活生生的事实，告诉了每个同志：“团结就是力量”。现在，这个经验在他们之间发生了极大的作用。他们之间的友爱关系增强了，他们每个同志的积极性也更提高了。
    二班长单义德同志，过去在教育同志时老是不耐心，爱发脾气。可是经过“海上风暴”的锻炼后，他改变了领导作风，向全班进行了自我检讨。现在，班里面亲爱团结如兄弟。战士们一致地赞扬着：“二班长变样了！干工作在头里，有事和大家商量。”
    一班副李洪宾回来后，被派到六班当班长。他原来就有个绰号叫“老婆婆”，现在似乎更显得名符其实了。他对待同志和班里的工作，确实像个家庭中的母亲一样，什么事都要照顾。他工作认真、待人热诚，是一个模范共产党员。排里小杨病了，李班长白天送水送饭，问寒问暖。夜里只要听见小杨一动弹，就问：“小杨要开水吗？”“冷不冷？我的棉袄给你盖吧……。”
    在海里漂流四天四夜的张排副，腿冻坏了，到现在还没有好。他回来后调到七连当排长，工作非常负责。全排战士提出：“学习张排长的艰苦精神！”
    经过半个月的岛上生活，他们更加认识了团结群众，依靠群众，帮助群众的重要性。现在他们经常自觉自动地帮助驻地群众挑水锄地。他们还捐了两万九千元钱，救济了两天没吃饭的一个老太婆。这件事情轰动了全村。群众对他们也更加爱戴了，都自动要为他们洗衣服、缝衣服……。
    回来后，党、上级、首长、同志们和老百姓都陆续来慰问。他们感到说不出的温暖和光荣。
    “我们怎样回答党、上级、同志、人民对我们的关怀和热爱呢？”这个问题在强烈地激发着他们献身人民事业的革命英雄主义：“要赶快练好本领，解放台湾，为人民再立功劳！”
    他们向上级要求早日参加练兵，并提出保证：“样样模范！处处带头，”“不会的苦练，已会的熟练。”他们这一排，在一、二月里，每天天还没亮就起床到连的集合场练单杠、木马、障碍。他们两手磨起了水泡，水泡破了又起血泡，结果成了硬梆梆的一块死皮，肉手变成了“铁手”。
    四十二位人民战士，他们经过党的培养，兄弟部队的帮助和“海上风暴”的锻炼，飞速地进步着。他们将与兄弟部队一起进军台湾，把残匪歼灭干净。
