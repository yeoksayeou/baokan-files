Xinhua News Agency, June 11th dispatch from Paris:

    Political commentator Goudard wrote in *L'Humanité*, commenting on the contradictions between Britain and the United States regarding the Schuman Plan for joint management of coal and steel, saying: Britain's resistance to the Schuman-Monnet Plan, instigated by the United States, makes people feel that contradictions have arisen between the imperialists of the anti-Soviet group. Needless to say, the issue is not between Britain and France, but a conflict between Britain and the United States. If Schuman did not have the backing of the State Department, he would not be so bold.

    What distinguishes the British bourgeoisie from the French bourgeoisie is that it still has something to preserve. The partially "restored" British industry is still capable of resisting German competition, at least to some extent it can sustain itself for some time. If Britain joins the "Schuman Combine," it can certainly force France to agree to bear some sacrifices, but in the course of years of constant struggle, it will ultimately fail, and at the very least, it will cause unparalleled difficulties for the British working people, thereby making them finally recognize the nature of their Social Democratic (Labour) Party leaders. This is why the Schuman Plan has met with such twofold opposition in Britain: on the one hand, opposition from financial circles, and on the other hand, opposition from parliamentary politicians who really do not have the courage to face the voters with such a plan in the near future.

    But this does not mean that the British government has abandoned its attempt to seek a hypocritical formula that would allow it to formally participate in the "plan" without actually participating, thereby meeting Washington's demands without harming British interests. London realizes that outright and complete acceptance of Schuman's *diktat* would mean the end of Britain as an industrial power. But on the other hand, it must be admitted that this acceptance is an inevitable result of being subordinate to the United States. Refusal would ultimately mean risking the destruction of the Atlantic alliance. Unconditionally agreeing, in the eyes of the British Empire, would mean a loss of prestige, accelerating the collapse of the British Empire, and completely abandoning the independence of the colonial mother country. The British government, after a final calculation, has apparently decided to try to delay the matter.

    舒曼有美国务院撑腰  英政府试图抗拒拖延
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：
    政论家古达德在人道报著文，评论英美两国间对舒曼的联合经营煤炭钢铁计划所存在的矛盾称：英国对美国策动的舒曼——摩纳计划的抵抗，使人们觉得反苏集团的帝国主义者之间发生了矛盾。无须说就可知道，问题并不是英法之间，而是英美之间的冲突。假如舒曼没有国务院的撑腰，他是不会这样勇敢的。
    英国资产阶级和法国资产阶级有所不同的就是，它还有一些需要保全的东西。部分地“恢复”了的英国工业，仍然有能力抗拒德国的竞争，最少在某种程度上它是能支持若干时候的。英国如果加入了“舒曼康拜因”，当然是可以迫使法国答应承担一些牺牲的，但是在数年的不断斗争过程中，它最终必会失败，并最低限度会使英国劳动人民遭受无比的困难，因而使他们最后认清他们的社会民主党（工党）领袖的本质。这就是舒曼计划为什么在英国遭到这样两重反对的原故：一方面有金融界人士的反对，另一方面有议会政客的反对，他们实在没有勇气在最近的将来拿着这样的计划来面对选民。
    但是这并不意味着英国政府已放弃了寻求一套虚伪公式的企图，这种公式可使它形式上参加“计划”而实际上不参加，从而应付了华盛顿的要求同时又不损害英国的利益。伦敦认识到：干脆而完全地接受舒曼的哀的美顿书，或将意味着英国作为工业强国的告终。但另一方面必须承认：这个接受是从属于美国的一个势所必然的结果。拒绝终将意味着有破坏大西洋联盟的危险。不加讨价还价而表示同意，则在不列颠帝国眼中看来将意味着丧失威信、加速不列颠帝国的崩溃以及完全放弃殖民母国的独立。英国政府最后盘算了一下，显然已决定了试图拖延时日。
