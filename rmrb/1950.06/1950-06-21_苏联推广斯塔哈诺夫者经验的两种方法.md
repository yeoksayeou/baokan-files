　　Two Methods of Promoting Stakhanovite Experience in the Soviet Union

          I. Stakhanovite Schools
    The weaver Maslova, a graduate of a Stakhanovite school, said in her statement: "Before, I did not complete the production quota, and the 40 meters of textiles produced were all of the third grade. After studying, I began to understand my shortcomings. I knew that I did not pay enough attention to the handover procedures, did not change the shuttle in time, and did not pay enough attention to the basic lines. Some movements I did wrong, and others I did too slowly. After studying at the school, I increased my output to 105.7 percent of the quota. Now the products I produce are all of the first grade. My salary has also increased by 100 rubles per month."
    Stakhanovite schools are a way to promote the experience of production innovators. These schools were created based on the Stakhanovites' own initiative, based on their valuable experience and production technology, and starting from the socialist competition principle instructed by Stalin. This principle is: in order to universally improve production, the advanced should provide comradely assistance to the backward. Now, Stakhanovite schools are widely established in industry, transportation, construction, and agriculture. In the years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, more than five million people have been trained in Stakhanovite schools.
    Stakhanovite schools come in various forms. There is a "mutual learning" school, sometimes called a "high labor productivity" school. The teaching basis of this school is: precisely calculating the time of each action in the labor process, and scientifically studying the Stakhanovite experience. The reason why the output of unskilled workers is low is because they are not good at organizing their labor. Precise calculation and research are to help workers think carefully about the labor process and how to rationalize it. The "mutual learning" school organizes three to five workers of the same trade—advanced, average, and backward—together to study, taught by experienced workers such as technicians. The teacher's task is to study the working methods of all workers, prepare a chart of precisely calculated action times for each worker, and then teach the best methods to the learning workers.
    "High labor productivity" schools also adopt such teaching principles. It is located in the factory. Workers learn on the spot at the Stakhanovite's work station. In 1949, 379 workers in the Moscow Electric Wire Factory participated in such learning. Their productivity increased by an average of 14 percent. The textile and light industry sectors have adopted the example of the "Proletarian Victory" factory: using precision timers to study the Stakhanovite's working methods, selecting the most reasonable ones as teaching materials, and having specially trained instructors who have studied the theory teach the workers at the work site, explaining to the workers why a certain method should be adopted.
    There is a school established along with the Stakhanovite movement. When the Soviet Union launched the movement for the production of high-quality products initiated by Zhutkike, many high-quality schools were established in industry, construction, agriculture, and transportation. The High Quality School of the Moscow Shcherbakov Silk Weaving Factory taught 269 workers in 1949. They increased labor productivity by an average of 20 percent and increased first-class products by 30 percent. Each school in this factory always absorbs several workers whose output quality is substandard. Leading each school are Stakhanovites—heads of the workshop administration and the trade union. Foremen or deputy foremen guide them in drawing up plans and study outlines, and teach them theoretical knowledge. Engineers and technicians from the entire factory give lectures on product quality, saving raw materials, and production technology two to three times a week.
    When industry demanded a wider adoption of economic accounting, more than 300 production sections of the Gorky City Molotov Automobile Factory adopted economic accounting. More than 4,500 people participated in individual and group economic accounting. To help them, a network of Stakhanovite schools was established in the factory. In these schools, workers learned about the cost of products and the principles of economic accounting from concrete examples, and learned methods of saving materials, tools, and electricity. Nearly a thousand people studied in these schools, led by planning and accounting staff, workshop directors, and foremen. Stakhanovites were invited to lecture on their own experiences in saving tools and materials. In one workshop's parts section, its workers saved 5,000 rubles worth of materials in the first month after studying; in the second month, they saved 8,000 rubles.
    There is a Stakhanovite school between factories. The first to establish these schools was the Leningrad Typewriter Manufacturing Factory. In order to study ways to improve production, lathe worker schools and chipping machine operator schools were established in the factory. Skilled workers in this field from eight enterprises in the city came to study. Later, the Machine Tool Manufacturing Department and the Central Council of Trade Unions also established such schools in the "Compressor" factory in Moscow. Eighty lathe workers and chipping machine operators from 28 enterprises in Moscow and near Moscow were sent to study. After these Stakhanovites completed their studies, they taught 400 people in their own factories. As a result, the number of machine tool workers producing at high speed has more than tripled, and labor productivity has greatly increased.
    The overall leadership of Stakhanovite schools belongs to the factory's trade union committee and enterprise management. In the workshop, the school is led by the workshop trade union committee and the workshop director, and in the workshop sub-section, it is led by the foreman and the trade union group. The characteristic of the school curriculum is that it is very specific and aims to solve the primary production tasks.
  II. Plan for Imparting Stakhanovite Working Methods
    Matrosov—Stalin Prize winner, instructor of Stakhanovite working methods at the "Paris Commune" Shoe Factory, described another way to promote the experience of production innovators in the Labor Daily. More than three years ago, after carefully studying the "average" number of completed quotas, the tailors at the "Paris Commune" factory concluded that this was mainly due to the achievements of the Stakhanovites. At that time, thousands of tailors in a class completed two to two and a half times the quota, while others did not complete the task. Therefore, one cannot look up to the "average" number. The "average" number does not reflect the true situation. Therefore, these tailors, guided by Stalin's instructions—achieving success and helping comrades—decided to raise the backward to the level of the advanced, by studying the experience of excellent Stakhanovites, summarizing it, and helping each tailor master these advanced working methods. In this way, the idea of formulating a plan for imparting Stakhanovite working methods was born. They organized groups to specifically study the working methods of advanced tailors. They truly collected the advanced, Stakhanovite experience bit by bit. One tailor added an automatic retracting spring device to his cutting machine, thus saving a valuable ten minutes of work time; another tailor made the simplest column for hanging leather, so that he did not have to bend down to the cutting machine to take the leather, and the leather was always at hand; the third tailor adopted a new and more economical method of cutting materials; the fourth tailor arranged the cutting knives in a new way; these and other new methods are reflected in the plan for imparting Stakhanovite working methods, which is to introduce advanced working methods to all tailors, and to impart the best experience at the work site without exception.
    From this time on, the tailors of the "Paris Commune" factory regularly formulate plans for imparting Stakhanovite working methods. These plans are being implemented vigorously in collective life. Three years ago, they cut 13,000 to 14,000 pairs of shoes every day, and today the quota is 32,000 to 33,000 pairs every day. And this is done with the same machines and by the same number of workers.
    Now all sectors of the national economy—machine manufacturing workers, metallurgical workers, coal miners, railway workers, chemical workers, and textile workers—are starting to formulate plans for imparting Stakhanovite working methods. Everywhere, the backward are being promoted, and everywhere, the experience of the advanced is being imparted in an organized manner.

　　苏联推广斯塔哈诺夫者经验的两种方法
    李何
          一、斯塔哈诺夫者学校
    从斯塔哈诺夫者学校毕业的女织工马斯洛娃自述说：“以前我没有完成生产定额，而出产的四十公尺纺织品，品质都是第三等的。学习之后，我开始明白我的缺点。我知道，我没有足够注意接班手续，没有及时换梭，并且对基本线注意得不够。有些动作我做得不对，而另外一些又做得太慢。到学校学习以后，我把产量提高到定额的百分之一零五·七。现在我所生产的产品都是第一等的了。我的工资每月也提高了一百卢布。”
    斯塔哈诺夫者学校是推广生产革新者经验的一种方式。这种学校是根据斯塔哈诺夫者自己的创议而产生的，是以他们的宝贵经验和生产技术为基础的，是从斯大林所指示的社会主义竞赛原则出发的。这个原则就是：为了普遍地提高生产，先进者要给落后者以同志的帮助。现在，斯塔哈诺夫者学校广泛地设立在工业、运输业、建筑业和农业之中。在战后五年计划的年份中，在斯塔哈诺夫者学校受过训练的就超过五百万人。
    斯塔哈诺夫者学校有种种不同的形式。有一种“互相学习”学校，有时叫做“高度劳动生产率”学校。这种学校的教学基础是：精密计算劳动过程中每一个动作的时间，科学地研究斯塔哈诺夫者经验。不熟练工人的产量之所以低，是因为不善于组织自己的劳动。精密的计算和研究，就是为了帮助工人很好地思考劳动过程，思考如何使劳动过程合理化。“互相学习”学校把先进的、普通的、落后的同业工人三至五个组织在一起学习，由技师等有经验的工人执教。教师的任务是研究所有工人的劳动方法，替每一工人制订精密计算动作时间的图表，然后把最好的方法教给学习的工人。
    “高度劳动生产率”学校也采取这样的教学原则。它设在工厂里。工人们在斯塔哈诺夫者工作的岗位上就地学习。一九四九年莫斯科电线工厂中，参加这样学习的工人就有三百七十九人。他们的生产率平均提高了百分之十四。纺织业和轻工业部门都采用“无产者胜利”工厂的范例：用精密测时表研究斯塔哈诺夫者的劳动方法，选择其中最合理的作为教材，由学过理论的专门的指导员在工作地点教授工人，向工人解释为什么应当采用某一种方法。
    有一种随着斯塔哈诺夫运动而设立的学校。当苏联展开朱特基克所倡导的生产优等质量产品运动的时候，在工业、建筑业、农业、运输业中纷纷建立了许多优等质量学校。莫斯科谢尔巴科夫丝织厂的优等质量学校在一九四九年就教会了二六九个工人。他们平均提高了劳动生产率的百分之二十，增加头等产品百分之三十。这个工厂的每一学校总吸收几个产量质量不及格的工人。领导每一学校的，是斯塔哈诺夫者——车间行政和工会的负责人。由领班或副领班来指导他们拟订计划和学习提纲，教他们理论知识。全厂的工程师和技师每周有二至三次来讲授产品质量、节约原料、生产技术的课程。
    当工业上要求更广泛地采用经济核算制的时候，高尔基城莫洛托夫汽车工厂的三百个以上的生产部分都采取了经济核算制。四千五百人以上参加了个人的和小组的经济核算制。为了帮助他们，厂内建立了斯塔哈诺夫者学校网。在这些学校中，工人们从具体的例子上认识了产品的成本和经济核算的原则，学习了节约材料、工具和电力的方法。学习由负责计划、计算的工作人员、车间长、领班领导，请斯塔哈诺夫者讲授自己节约工具和材料的经验，在这些学校里学习的近千人。有一个车间的零件部分，它的工人在学习后的第一月就节省了五千卢布的材料；第二月，节省了八千卢布。
    有一种工厂之间的斯塔哈诺夫者学校。第一个建立这些学校的是列宁格勒的铸字机制造厂。为了研究提高生产的办法，在工厂里建立了旋盘工人学校和削截器使用工人的学校。全城八个企业的这一门熟练工人都来学习。后来机器工具制造部和工会中央理事会也在莫斯科“康普勒梭尔”工厂设立了这样的学校。莫斯科和莫斯科附近二十八个企业派了八十个旋盘工人和削截器使用工人去学习。这些斯塔哈诺夫者学成后，在自己的工厂又教了四百人。因此，以高速度生产的母机工人的数目增加了三倍以上，劳动生产率大大提高了。
    斯塔哈诺夫者学校的总的领导，属于工厂的工会委员会和企业管理人员。在车间里，学校由车间工会委员会和车间长领导，在车间分部里由领班和工会小组领导。学校课程的特色是非常具体、以解决首要的生产任务为目标。
  二、斯塔哈诺夫者劳动方法传授计划
    马特罗梭夫——斯大林奖金获得者，“巴黎公社”鞋厂斯塔哈诺夫者劳动方法指导员，在劳动报上叙述了推广生产革新者经验的又一种方式。三年多以前，“巴黎公社”工厂的裁缝工人在仔细研究了完成定额的“平均”数以后，得出结论说：这主要是靠了斯塔哈诺夫者的成绩。当时几千个裁缝工人在一班中完成了定额的两倍到两倍半，而其他人却没有完成任务。所以“平均”数掩盖了那些落后者。这就是说，不能向“平均”数看齐。“平均”数没有表示出事情的真实情况。于是，这些裁缝工人们以斯大林的指示——取得成功、帮助同志——为指导，决定把落后者提高到先进者的水平上来，方法是研究优秀的斯塔哈诺夫者的经验，加以总结，并且帮助每个裁缝工人精通这些先进的工作方法。这样，便产生了制订传授斯塔哈诺夫者劳动方法的计划的思想。他们组织了小组，专门研究先进的裁缝工人的工作方法。他们真正一点一滴地收集了先进的、斯塔哈诺夫者的经验。有一个裁缝工人在自己的压切机上添加了一个自动收回压切器的弹簧装置，因而节省了宝贵的工作时间十分钟；另一个裁缝工人制造了最简单的挂皮的柱子，因而用不着常常弯腰到压切机底下取皮，皮经常在手边了；第三个裁缝工人采用了新的、更经济的剪裁材料的方法；第四个裁缝工人按新的方式来安排切刀；这些和其他新方法都表现在斯塔哈诺夫者劳动方法的传授计划中，这个计划是要把先进的劳动方法介绍给所有的裁缝工人，是要在工作地点无例外地传授最好的经验。
    从这个时候起，“巴黎公社”工厂的裁缝工人经常制订传授斯塔哈诺夫者劳动方法的计划。这些计划在集体生活中生气勃勃地实行着。三年前他们每天裁好一万三四千双鞋，今天的定额是每天裁好三万二三千双。而这是用同样的机器，由同样多的工人做到的。
    现在国民经济各部门——机器制造工人、冶金工人、煤矿工人、铁路工人、化学工人、纺织工人都着手制订斯塔哈诺夫者劳动方法传授计划。到处推动落后者，到处在有组织地传授先进者的经验。
