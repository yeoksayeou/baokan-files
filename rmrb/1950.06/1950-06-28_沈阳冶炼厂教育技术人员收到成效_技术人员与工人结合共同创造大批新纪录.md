　　Shenyang News: Shenyang Smelter has transformed from a backward factory into an advanced one. One of the reasons for this is the combination of technology and worker labor.
    In the past half-year, the factory has been using technical seminars to enable technical personnel to regularly study technical problems with workers. For example, the zinc electrolysis research group solved 36 technical problems, large and small, in 20 days. Technical personnel also frequently go deep into the field to help workers solve technical difficulties and generally improve the scientific knowledge of the workers. For example, the factory's steel blast furnace improved the feeding method in the joint research of technical personnel and workers, preventing the occurrence of accidents. Among the factory's 30 technical personnel, 22 technical personnel have jointly created new records. This is an important sign of the integration of technology and worker labor in the factory.
    In the past, the factory's technical personnel were disconnected from the workers. This was mainly due to the lack of good education and transformation of technical personnel. To this end, the factory, after review, carried out a series of improvement work: (1) Starting in January this year, the leadership of study for technical personnel and staff was strengthened. More than 50 technical personnel in the factory participated in the theoretical study of political economy. At the same time, policy and ideological education was carried out to eliminate the "guest" mentality of technical personnel in public enterprises. (2) Care for the political life of technical personnel, absorb them into the factory management committee, generally convene symposiums for technical personnel and staff, accept their rationalization proposals, and pay attention to absorbing outstanding elements among them into the Party. (3) Strengthen the supervision, inspection and assistance of various tasks of technical personnel and staff. For example, listening to their periodic reports, organizing technical reports of technical personnel, and holding business examinations to promote their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility in their work. (4) Give full play to the role of technical personnel in production as much as possible, immediately commend those who have achieved results, and support and encourage technical research. For example, after technician Wang Maochuan's research on the electrolytic method to refine bismuth was successful, the cost was reduced by nine-tenths, which was greatly praised and encouraged by the factory. According to the factory's experience, to improve product quality and reduce costs, in addition to improving business management, it is necessary to combine science and technology with the enthusiastic labor of workers and give full play to the role of technology in production.

　　沈阳冶炼厂教育技术人员收到成效
    技术人员与工人结合共同创造大批新纪录
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：沈阳冶炼厂由一个落后的工厂变为一个先进的工厂，其原因之一，就是技术与工人的劳动相结合。
    近半年来，该厂利用技术座谈会的形式，使技术人员经常与工人共同研究技术问题，如锌电解的研究小组，在二十天内解决了三十六个大小技术问题。技术人员也经常深入现场，帮助工人解决技术困难，并普遍的提高了工友们的科学智识。如该厂钢鼓风炉就是在技术人员与工人共同研究中，改进了进料的方法，制止了事故的发生。该厂三十个技术人员中，就有二十二个技术人员与工人共同创造了新纪录。这是该厂技术与工人劳动相结合的一个重要的标志。
    过去，该厂技术人员与工人是脱节的。这主要是对技术人员没有很好的教育和改造。为此，该厂经过检讨，进行了一连串的改进工作：（一）今年一月起，加强了对技术人员与职员的学习领导。全厂五十余名技术人员都参加了政治经济学的理论学习。同时并进行了政策与思想教育，消除了技术人员在公营企业中的“作客”思想。（二）关心技术人员的政治生活，吸收他们参加工厂管理委员会，普遍召开技术人员与职员座谈会，接受他们的合理化建议，注意吸收他们中间的优秀分子入党。（三）加强对技术人员与职员各种工作的督促、检查与帮助。例如听取他们定期的汇报，组织技术人员的技术报告，举行业务考试等方法，以促进其发挥工作的积极性和责任心。（四）尽量发挥技术人员在生产中的作用，对有成绩的立即表扬，对技术研究加以支持和鼓励。如技术员王懋钏研究以电解法来提炼铋成功后，成本减低了十分之九，得到该厂的多方表扬和鼓励。根据该厂经验，要提高产品质量和降低成本，除改进企业管理外，就必须把科学技术和工人的热情劳动相结合，发挥技术在生产中的作用。
