Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Speech by Zhang Feng翙, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The full text is as follows: Chairman, fellow members, gentlemen:

　　At the Second Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Chairman Mao spoke in his opening address that the central issue of this meeting is the land reform plan; followed by Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on land reform and the work reports of many responsible comrades of the Central People's Government. After listening to these reports, we know that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, great progress has been made in these eight months. It must be understood that changing a feudal land system of landlord class exploitation into a democratic, truly equal, mutually beneficial, prosperous, and happy land system is an extremely arduous task. Before today, the government has completed land reform in Northeast China, Hebei, Shandong, Pingyuan, and Henan in order. According to information from various sources, there are, of course, unavoidable deviations, but the majority of peasants are happy and amazed by this measure of the government and have no complaints. In the draft Land Reform Law, attention is also paid to preserving the rich peasant economy and keeping the land untouched. This is, of course, the best step from an agricultural country to an industrialized country. I participated in three land reform group meetings, studied them in detail, and obtained many valuable materials. I returned to Shaanxi to convey them to the people of all strata, all county and city people's governments, people's representative conferences, and peasant representative conferences, so that the general people of Shaanxi, especially the peasants, would develop a sense of trust and consciousness in the central government's instructions on land reform in order to complete this major task. I believe it can be successful. Finally, I shout:

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!
　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government!

　　陕西省人民政府副主席
    张凤翙的发言
    【新华社二十二日讯】陕西省人民政府副主席张凤翙在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次大会上的发言。全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    此次在政协全国委员会第二次会议大会上，毛主席在开幕词中讲，此次会议中心问题是土地改革方案；接着就是刘少奇副主席土地改革报告与中央人民政府许多位负责同志的工作报告，我们听了这些报告，知道自中华人民共和国成立以来，在这八个月中有了很大的进步。要知道将一个封建式地主阶级剥削的土地制度，改成一个民主的真正平等互助的富强康乐的土地制度，是一种极艰巨的工作。政府在今天以前将东北、河北、山东、平原、河南的土改已经次第完成，据各方情报，当然有不可避免的偏差，但大多数的农民皆欢喜赞叹政府这一措施而无闲言。在土地改革法草案中，又照顾到保存富农经济、土地不动，这当然是由农业化国家进展到工业化国家的最好步骤。我参加了三次土地改革小组会议，详加研讨，得了许多的宝贵材料，回到陕西，传达给各阶层各县市人民政府各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议，使陕西一般人民尤其是农民对中央土地改革指示生一种信任心与自觉心，以便完成这一重大工作，我相信可以成功的。最后我高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中央人民政府毛泽东主席万岁！
