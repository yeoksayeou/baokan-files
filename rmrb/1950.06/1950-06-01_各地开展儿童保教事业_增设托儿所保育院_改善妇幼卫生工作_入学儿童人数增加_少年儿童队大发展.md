Across the country, children's education and care undertakings are developing.
	More nurseries and kindergartens added · Improved maternal and child health work
	Number of enrolled children increased · Young Pioneers develop greatly
[Report from this newspaper] The provision in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to "pay attention to protecting the health of mothers, infants, and children" has achieved considerable success in implementation. Children's care, maternal and child health, and children's education are gradually being developed in various regions.

	According to statistics from twenty-seven provinces and cities, there are already more than five hundred nurseries.
In cities, local people's governments, the Communist Party, democratic women's federations, and factories with more female workers generally pay attention to the care of the children of the working people, especially the children of female workers. On the one hand, they are restoring, improving, and expanding the original nurseries and kindergartens, and on the other hand, they are gradually increasing care facilities under the existing conditions. As of May this year, there were 541 public and private childcare institutions in twenty-seven major provinces and cities, caring for 35,000 children. This work is being carried out while overcoming the dual difficulties of current material conditions and lack of talent. The All-China Women's Federation and local women's federations have successively run many short-term training classes for childcare workers in the past year. According to statistics from ten regions including Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenyang, a total of 1,047 people have been trained. In the work of running nurseries, various places have also gained some experience. For example, the nursery of the No. 7 Rubber Factory in Shenyang City is led by a management committee jointly composed of the factory director, the trade union, the medical room, the person in charge of the nursery, and parent representatives. Everyone puts forward opinions, thinks of solutions, and cooperates with each other to do a good job in the care and education of children. The staff in the nursery carefully plan to reduce the burden on the children's parents. Each child only spends 15 to 20 points per month on food (the average salary of female workers in the factory is about 100 points), and the children can get quite adequate nutrition. Eight staff members (six child care workers, one handyman, and the director兼kindergarten teacher) take care of forty-nine children. They have established contact contracts, accurately divided labor, and guaranteed to do their work well, giving full play to their high work efficiency. Over the past year, all the children have made significant progress in their physical and intellectual development. More than forty nurseries in Shandong generally pay attention to the healthy development of children's physical and mental well-being. Nurseries that take care of the existing living standards of the working people and can carefully take care of their children are welcomed. However, some nurseries excessively emphasize the children's nutritional standards and charge very high fees, making it impossible for the children of the working people to attend, and even making the children used to a higher standard of living in the nursery, and they do not eat the food at home after returning home; some cannot properly discipline the children and cannot gain the trust of parents; and some nurseries, especially those run by supply agencies, have a serious waste of manpower. For example, a nursery in Liaodong used seventy-five staff members to take care of forty-six children. These all need to be improved quickly. In addition, the health care work for children in some private nurseries needs to be improved.

	Training rural midwives and conducting publicity on maternal and infant hygiene
Regarding maternal and infant hygiene, in the past year, the people's governments and democratic women's federations in some areas of North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China have vigorously trained and reformed rural midwives and carried out rural maternal and infant hygiene work. According to incomplete statistics from North China and Northeast China, more than 9,000 new and old birth attendants have been trained. These trained personnel have begun to use new methods to deliver babies in rural areas, greatly reducing umbilical cord infection in infants and puerperal fever in women. According to statistics from Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, the infant mortality rate has dropped from 50% to 60% last year to about 16% in May this year. Many places also conduct mass publicity and education on maternal and infant hygiene in urban and rural areas through winter schools, folk schools, or using slides and roving exhibitions. In addition, Beijing, Tianjin, and other cities have banned brothels, and the Inner Mongolia People's Government has sent medical teams to the grasslands to treat the widespread venereal diseases among herders, which are beneficial to the health of the next generation of children.

	Elementary schools in old liberated areas are developing rapidly, and a large number of children of workers and peasants are enrolled.
In terms of children's education, elementary school education in the old liberated areas has made great progress in the past year. For example, there are currently more than 3.77 million elementary school students in the Northeast region, an increase of 48% compared with the Japanese occupation period; a large number of children of workers and peasants have entered elementary schools. According to statistics from the Northeast region, the children of workers, peasants, and other working people account for 81.3% of all enrolled children. In Shanghai, 675 evening classes for workers' children, evening classes for children, and 14 educational institutions for special children have been established, absorbing a large number of children of the working people into schools. Children who are wandering on the streets are also gradually taken into children's reformatories, where they are educated and taught production skills. The New Democratic Youth League and other cultural and educational organizations have published seven or eight newspapers and magazines for children, including the "New Pioneer" newspaper, which has a circulation of nearly 80,000 copies per issue, becoming one of the most popular publications for children in Shanghai and East China. Many schools use it as supplementary teaching material. The Shanghai Municipal Working Committee of the Youth League and the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station jointly run children's radio programs, broadcasting regularly for children, with an audience of more than 20,000 people. Now, local people's governments are working hard to consolidate existing schools and improve the quality of teachers and teaching. In the newly liberated areas and areas affected by disasters last year, the people's government is making great efforts to maintain and restore the original elementary schools, and try to avoid or reduce the phenomenon of teachers and students dropping out of school and losing their jobs. For example, in the severely affected areas of Yutai, Jiaxiang, and other five counties in Pingyuan Province, 71.9% of the elementary schools continue to have classes; in the severely affected area of Huaiyin Prefecture in northern Jiangsu, which accounts for 30% of the total area, only 3% of the schools have been suspended.

	The number of Young Pioneers has surged, and many have become learning models.
In order to cultivate and educate the vast number of new Chinese children, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a decision to establish the Chinese Young Pioneers in October last year. As of April this year, the number of Young Pioneers members has grown to 478,488. The Young Pioneers teams in various schools assist in regular class learning and carry out a variety of extracurricular activities that are beneficial to the physical and mental health of children. Since the establishment of the team in many schools, the students who joined the team have worked hard to study, consciously abide by learning discipline, and their grades have greatly improved. Many children have become models of learning. For example, in Liujiazhuang Elementary School in Jinan City, 133 of the 136 model students are members of the Young Pioneers. At Gaoqiao Elementary School in Nanchang City, the academic performance of the Young Pioneers members has generally improved, and they automatically go to school in the evening to help non-members with tutoring. The Young Pioneers in Harbin City created the "catch typos" game to improve children's attention to typos; and held popular science knowledge lectures, organized children to visit factories, led children to hold various parties and get-togethers, and participate in minor labor, etc., to improve teaching effectiveness and cultivate children's new morality of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and caring for public property.

　　各地开展儿童保教事业
    增设托儿所保育院·改善妇幼卫生工作 
    入学儿童人数增加·少年儿童队大发展
    【本报讯】中国人民政协共同纲领中“注意保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康”的规定，在实行中已获得相当成绩。各地的儿童保育、妇幼卫生、儿童教育等工作正逐步开展。
    据二十七个省市统计  已有五百多个托儿所
    在城市中，各地人民政府、共产党、民主妇联和女工较多的工厂等，一般都重视了劳动人民子女，特别是女工子女的保育问题。他们一面恢复、改进和扩大原有的托儿所与保育院，一面在现有的条件下逐步增设保托机关。到今年五月，二十七个重要省市已有公私立托儿机关五四一处，受托儿童三万五千名。这一工作是在克服了当前物质条件与人材缺乏的双重困难下进行的。全国妇联和各地妇联一年来先后开办了许多短期的保育人员训练班，据北京、上海、沈阳等十个地区统计，受训人员共有一千零四十七名。在办理托儿所的工作上，各地也获得了一些经验。例如沈阳市橡胶七厂的托儿所，他们由工厂的厂长和工会、医务室、托儿所的负责人以及家长代表共同组成管理委员会来领导，大家提意见，想办法，互相配合搞好孩子的保教工作。所内工作人员细心筹划，减轻儿童家长的负担，每个孩子每月仅花伙食费十五分到二十分（该厂一般女工薪金平均约一百分），而孩子们能获得相当充分的营养。所内八名工作人员（保育员六名、杂工一名、所长兼幼稚教员）照顾着四十九个孩子。她们订立了联系合同，精确分工，互相保证作好自己的工作，发挥了高度的工作效能，一年来使所有孩子的身体和智慧都有显著的进步。山东的四十多处托儿所也一般的都注意了儿童身心的健全发展。凡是这样照顾劳动人民现有的生活水平，又能精心带好孩子的托儿所，都获得欢迎。但是，还有某些托儿所过分强调儿童的营养水准，收费很高，使劳动人民子女无法入托，甚至使孩子在所内过惯较高的生活，回家后不吃家里的饭；有的则不能很好地管教好孩子，不能取得家长的信任；还有部分托儿所，特别是供给机关所办的，浪费人力现象很严重，例如辽东某托儿所，收托四十六名儿童用了七十五名工作人员。这些都待迅速改进。此外，有些私立托儿所中对于儿童的保健工作也有待改善。
    训练农村助产人员  进行妇婴卫生宣传
    关于妇婴卫生方面，一年来华北、东北和西北等地的部分地区的人民政府和民主妇联，曾大力训练与改造农村助产员，并开展农村妇婴卫生工作。据华北、东北不完全统计，受训的新旧接产人员达九千名以上。这些受训人员已开始用新方法在农村接生，大大地减少了婴孩的脐带风和产妇的产褥热。据黑龙江省讷河县统计，婴孩死亡率已由去年的百分之五十到六十降低至今年五月的百分之十六左右。许多地方并通过冬学、民校，或利用幻灯、巡回展览会等，在城乡开展群众性的有关妇婴卫生的宣传教育工作。此外，北京、天津等市都取缔了妓院，内蒙人民政府并已派医疗队深入草原为牧民治疗普遍存在的性病，这些都有益于下一代儿童的健康。
    老区小学迅速发展  大量工农子女入学
    在儿童教育方面，老解放区的小学教育一年来获得很大的发展。如东北区目前有小学生三百七十七万余人，较日本占领时期增加了百分之四十八；大批工人、农民的子女进入了小学，据东北区统计，工、农和其他劳动人民子女已占全体入学儿童的百分之八一点三。在上海，创办了六百七十五所工人子弟晚班、儿童晚班和十四所特殊儿童的教育机构，吸收了大量的劳动人民子弟入学。对流浪街头的儿童，也逐渐收容到儿童教养所里，予以教育和授以生产技术。新民主主义青年团及其他文教团体为少年儿童出版了七、八种报纸和杂志，其中“新少年”报每期发行近八万份，成为上海市及华东区少年儿童最爱读的刊物之一，很多学校都用它作为补充教材。青年团上海市工作委员会与上海人民广播电台合办儿童广播节目，定期为儿童广播，听众达二万余人。现在各地人民政府正在努力巩固现有学校，并提高师资和教学质量。在新解放区和去年受灾荒的地区，人民政府以大力来维持与恢复原有的小学，尽量避免或减少师生的失学失业现象。如平原省的重灾区鱼台、嘉祥等五县，百分之七十一点九的小学都继续上课；苏北淮阴专区的重灾区面积占全面积的百分之三十，而停顿的小学仅占学校数的百分之三。
    少年儿童队员激增  很多成为学习模范
    为着培养、教育广大的新中国少年儿童，中国新民主主义青年团于去年十月发布了建立中国少年儿童队的决定。至今年四月止，少年儿童队队员已发展至四十七万八千四百八十八人。各地学校的少年儿童队辅助正课学习，开展了多种多样的有益儿童身心健康的课内课外活动。很多学校自建队以后，入队的学生都努力学习，自觉地遵守学习纪律，成绩大大提高，很多儿童都成为学习的模范。如济南市刘家庄小学，一百三十六名模范学生中，队员就占了一百三十三名。南昌市高桥小学，少年儿童队队员的学习成绩普遍提高，他们并自动在晚上到校帮助非队员补习功课。哈尔滨市的少年儿童队创造了“抓错别字”游戏，以提高儿童对错别字的注意；并举办通俗科学知识讲座、组织儿童参观工厂、领导儿童举办各种晚会、联欢会，参加轻微的劳动等，以提高教学效果和培养儿童的爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的新道德。
