　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: MacArthur, after illegally "purging" all twenty-four members of the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee on the 6th, illegally "purged" seventeen people, including staff members of the Akahata newspaper and JCP member of the Diet, Tokutomi Kekee, on the 7th. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo: MacArthur sent another letter to Shigeru Yoshida on the 7th, making baseless slanders against the Japanese people's mouthpiece – the Japanese Communist Party's organ, the Akahata newspaper – and then instructed his loyal lackey, the Yoshida government, to "purge" seventeen people, including Tokutomi Kekee, who, according to MacArthur, were "responsible for the policies determining the content of the newspaper (referring to the Akahata newspaper)". According to Kyodo News, after receiving MacArthur's instructions, the Yoshida government decided on the same day to take measures based on the "purge order" and issued notifications to the above-mentioned seventeen people.
　　According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 7th, a spokesperson for the Akahata newspaper stated: Of the seventeen people who were illegally "purged," except for three people, including the newspaper's editor, publisher, and printer, Koichi Shimada, the other fourteen people, including Tokutomi Kekee, are not current staff members of the newspaper.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: TASS Shanghai, 8th dispatch: The reactionary forces in Japan are currently very rampant. Japanese radio reported: The Ministry of Justice is studying whether MacArthur's instructions have the meaning of banning the Japanese Communist Party as an organization. Since the 5th, Tokyo has indefinitely banned assemblies, demonstrations, and indoor and outdoor rallies. A meeting scheduled for the 6th by the All-Japan Metalworkers' Union was also banned. Two union leaders, Nakahara and Kondo, were arrested.
　　Japanese police are in a state of readiness for combat.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: TASS, 8th dispatch, citing Tokyo news: Four workers arrested during a mass demonstration for peace held on May 30th were handed over to the American military authorities by the Tokyo police authorities on the 6th. Newspapers pointed out that the Japanese police interrogated them about the leaflets they were carrying, which contained questions addressed to MacArthur. They will be tried by a military court.

　　麦克阿瑟继续横暴进攻日本人民
    又非法“整肃”听涛克己等
    东京无限期禁止集会示威
    【新华社九日讯】麦克阿瑟在六日非法“整肃”日本共产党中央委员会全体二十四名委员后，又于七日非法“整肃”赤旗报职员及日共众议员听涛克己等十七人。据美联社东京讯：麦克阿瑟七日再度致函吉田茂，对日本人民的喉舌——日本共产党机关报赤旗报——进行毫无根据的诬蔑后，随即指令其忠实走狗吉田政府对麦克阿瑟所谓“要对决定该报（按指赤旗报）内容的政策负责”的听涛克己等十七人加以“整肃”。据共同社称，吉田政府接到麦克阿瑟的指令后，当日即决定采取根据“整肃令”的措施，对上述十七人发出通知。
    另据美联社七日讯，赤旗报一发言人称：被非法“整肃”的十七人中，除该报编辑兼发行印刷人岛田小市等三人以外，其他十四人，包括听涛克己在内，都不是该报的现任工作人员。
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社上海八日讯：日本的反动势力目前甚为嚣张。日本电台报道：法务府正在研讨麦克阿瑟的指令，是否有将日本共产党作为一个组织而加以禁止的意义。自五日起，东京已无限期地禁止举行集会、示威和户内户外的大会。全日本金属工人工会定于六日举行的会议也遭到禁止。两位工会领袖中原和近藤被捕。
    日本警察处于准备作战的状态中。
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社八日电引东京消息：于五月三十日举行争取和平的群众示威时被逮捕的四名工人，已由东京警察当局于六日移解给美国军事当局。报纸指出：日本警察就他们携带的传单加以审讯，在这些传单上面写着向麦克阿瑟提出的问题。他们将由军事法庭审讯。
