　　Guarantee Wheat Price Stability, Promote Urban-Rural Exchange
    Prevent Downward Flow of Currency from Suddenly Flooding Cities and Affecting Prices
    State-Owned Specialized Companies Will Jointly with Private Merchants Transport Large Quantities of Industrial Products to Rural Areas
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] This year, due to the expansion of wheat planting area within the customs, the expected harvest is greater than in previous years. In order to purchase surplus grain from farmers within the customs and prevent low wheat prices from harming farmers, the Central Trade Department has now formulated a plan to purchase wheat this year, starting in July and continuing in succession. The entire purchase task is scheduled to be completed by the end of May next year. It is determined that 75 percent of the plan will be completed by the end of this year, and 45 percent of the annual purchase task will be completed in July, August, and September of this year.
    The price for purchasing surplus grain has been principally determined. Based on the wheat price in the wheat-producing areas, it is generally lower than millet and higher than corn. To ensure reasonable wheat prices, the Trade Department has also determined prices based on the natural circulation patterns and price differences of wheat between various regions. The North China region will be slightly lower than East China, the Central South region lower than East China, and the Northwest and Southwest regions will be lower. However, appropriate price differences will be carefully prescribed for areas bordering between regions.
    Along with the purchase of grain, a huge amount of currency will flow into the countryside. However, in order to avoid currency flooding the countryside and suddenly rushing into the cities, causing price fluctuations, the China Grain Company, in coordination with fraternal specialized companies such as those dealing in cotton yarn, cloth, general merchandise, salt, and coal, will carry urban industrial products with a value equivalent to 45 percent of the purchase volume and transport them steadily into the countryside, promptly withdrawing currency to maintain normal prices. It is expected that in addition to the 45 percent of the currency released being withdrawn by various specialized companies, the remaining 55 percent will be withdrawn by private merchants who transport industrial and handicraft products to the countryside, and a portion of the currency will be retained in the countryside as a means of exchange between farmers to expand the monetary front in rural areas. Currently, various specialized companies are actively preparing industrial products based on the needs of farmers.
    To facilitate the completion of the purchase task, it is planned to establish purchasing stations along the railways in various wheat-producing areas to facilitate transportation. In areas with cooperatives, the purchase task will be carried out entirely through the cooperatives.
    Currently, with the unfolding of the huge purchase task, the China Grain Company urgently needs to solve the problems of warehouse storage and packaging equipment to avoid huge waste during the purchase. (Kang Weizhong)

　　保证麦价稳定  促进城乡交流
    预防下乡货币突然冲进城市影响物价
    国营专业公司将联合私商  把大量工业品运到农村去
    【本报讯】今年关内由于种麦面积的扩大，预计收成较往年为多。中央贸易部为收购关内农民余粮，防止麦贱伤农，现已制定今年收购小麦计划，从七月份开始，陆续收购。全部收购任务确定明年五月底完成。今年年底确定完成计划的百分之七十五，而在今年七、八、九三个月将完成全年收购任务的百分之四十五。
    收购余粮的价格已原则确定。按产麦区的小麦价为标准，一般低于小米，高于玉米。为使麦价合理，贸易部又根据各个地区间小麦的自然流转规律和差价，确定价格。华北区稍低于华东，中南区低于华东，西北、西南均低。但对地区间接界处则慎重规定适当的差价。
    随着收购粮食，将使巨量货币下乡。但为了避免货币充斥农村，突然冲进城市，引起物价波动，中国粮食公司又配合花纱布、百货、盐业和煤业等兄弟专业公司，将携带价值相当于百分之四十五收购量的城市工业品，源源运进农村，及时回笼货币，使物价保持正常。预计除由各专业公司回笼所投放货币的百分之四十五外，其余的百分之五十五，则由私商贩运工业及手工业品下乡回笼，并在农村中保留一部货币，作为农民之间的交换手段，以扩大农村的货币阵地。现各专业公司根据农民需要，已积极筹备工业品。
    为便利收购任务的完成，准备在各产麦区铁路沿线设立收购站，便利运送。收购任务，在有合作社的地区全部通过合作社进行收购。
    目前随着巨大的收购任务的展开，中国粮食公司应急待解决仓库保管和包装用具问题，免遭收购中的巨大浪费。（康伟中）
