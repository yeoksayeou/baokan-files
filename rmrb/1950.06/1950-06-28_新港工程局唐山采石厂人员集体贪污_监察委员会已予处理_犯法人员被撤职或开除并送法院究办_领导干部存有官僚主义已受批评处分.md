　　Collective Embezzlement by Personnel at Tangshan Quarry of Xingang Engineering Bureau
    Supervisory Committee Has Handled the Matter
    Law-Breaking Personnel Have Been Removed or Expelled and Sent to Court for Prosecution
    Leading Cadres Have Been Criticized for Bureaucracy
    [Our Newspaper] It has been reported that from June of last year to February of this year, the Xingang Engineering Bureau, under the Navigation General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, sent seven employees from the First Work Zone, including Yang Shoubai and Meng Yucai, and one temporary worker to mine and transport flagstones from Jiajiashan and other locations in Tangshan. During the quarrying period, Yang Shoubai and others colluded with unscrupulous merchants to engage in corruption collectively, with the support of Bao Shengwu, the director of the First Work Zone. Over the course of eight months, they embezzled public funds equivalent to 38,098 catties of corn through methods such as forging receipts, overpricing, making advance payments and then issuing receipts for reimbursement after prices rose, misappropriating public funds for personal gain, and stealing or seizing public property. As a result of the embezzlement and false reporting, the cost of labor was inflated, the unit price was unreasonable, and the public suffered losses worth approximately 280,000 catties of corn. This embezzlement incident came to light on February 6th of this year when Meng Jiude, the brother of Yang Yucai and a supervisor in the First Work Zone, having raised his ideological awareness, revealed the embezzlement by Meng Yucai and others at an ideological self-criticism meeting held by the work zone's staff. On February 14th, the work zone transferred Meng Yucai back from Tangshan, and after persuasion and education by Meng Jiude, he confessed the embezzlement. Subsequently, the Ministry of Communications formed a review committee and sent personnel to Tangshan to investigate, clarifying the entire case and its causes. The People's Supervisory Committee of the Government Administration Council, based on the report of the Ministry of Communications, reviewed the matter and decided on the handling method, which has been approved by the Government Administration Council and ordered to be implemented by the Ministry of Communications. The handling methods are as follows: (1) Bao Shengwu, chief engineer and director of the First Work Zone of the Xingang Engineering Bureau; Yang Shoubai, the person in charge of the Tangshan Quarry; Zhang Hengduo, Wang Xuansheng, Meng Yucai, Li Zuozhou, Qian Hengyu and temporary worker Zhang Jiec忱 are subject to removal or dismissal in addition to the confiscation of embezzled funds at the real-time value, and sent to the judicial authorities for prosecution. (2) Cheng Diben, manager of the Tangshan Xin Xin Theater, Hua Chang Rice and Noodle Grocery Store, and Wang Yuzhong, a former quarry worker, who colluded with public officials in malpractice or participated in embezzlement, shall be prosecuted in local courts and punished according to law. (3) Meng Jiude, the whistleblower in this case, should be commended for not shielding his brother Meng Yucai due to feudal family concepts. (4) Military Representative Zhou Lun and Military Representative Assistant Dong Hongbo were ideologically paralyzed, subjectively believing that "small problems are inevitable, and big problems will not occur" in the First Work Zone and the quarry. They were lenient with Bao Shengwu, trusting and using him unconditionally without further understanding or educating him. They did not give due importance to the quarry, which had few cadres but high expenses. They did not inspect the work, only sending Bao Shengwu to the Tangshan quarry for inspection once in half a year; Bao came back and said, "It's doing well," and they blindly believed it. Dong Hongbo did not inspect the quarry once in the two months he was in the First Work Zone. Zhou and Dong both have a bureaucratic work style, which caused the embezzlement to continue for eight months before being discovered, resulting in the loss of people's property. Each will receive criticism.

　　新港工程局唐山采石厂人员集体贪污
    监察委员会已予处理
    犯法人员被撤职或开除并送法院究办
    领导干部存有官僚主义已受批评处分
    【本报讯】交通部航务总局所属新港工程局于去年六月至今年二月，派第一工区职工杨寿柏、孟玉才等七人，临时工一人，采运唐山贾家山等处片石。在采石期间，杨寿柏等勾结奸商舞弊，集体进行贪污，并得到第一工区主任暴绳武的支持。前后八个月中，以假造单据、多报价款；先期付款，待物价上涨后再行开单据报销；挪用公款营私；盗卖或攫据公物等方法，贪污公款折合玉米共三万八千零九十八斤。贪污虚报的结果，使工价抬高，单价不合理，使公家损失约值玉米二十八万斤。此一贪污事件至今年二月六日，第一工区举行职员思想检讨会时，杨玉才之兄，第一工区监工孟久德因思想觉悟提高，在会上始向该工区揭露孟玉才等的贪污行为。二月十四日该工区将孟玉才自唐山调回，经孟久德说服教育，坦白说出贪污情形。其后交通部为此组成审查委员会，派专人赴唐山调查，查明了全案经过及其产生的原因。政务院人民监察委员会根据交通部的报告加以审议，决定了处理办法，业经政务院批准，令交通部执行。其处理办法如下：（一）新港工程局第一工区主任正工程司暴绳武、唐山采石厂负责人工务员杨寿柏、工务员张恒铎、王旋生、测工孟玉才、制火药工李佐周、搬运工钱恒裕、临时工张洁忱等，集体贪污，除按折实价追回赃款外，并予以撤职或开除处分，送司法机关究办。（二）唐山新新剧院经理程帝炳，华昌米面杂货铺，前采石工人王玉忠，勾结公务人员舞弊或参与贪污事件，均应向当地法院起诉，依法惩办。（三）本案告发人孟久德，不因封建的家庭观念包庇其弟孟玉才，应予表扬。（四）军代表周纶、军代表助理董洪波，思想上麻痹，主观上认为第一工区、采石场“小问题不可避免，大问题不会有”。对暴绳武迁就，无条件地信任使用，没有进一步地进行了解和教育。对干部少而开支大的采石场，未给以应有的重视。不检查工作，半年中只派暴绳武去唐山采石场检查了一次；暴回来说：“做的还不错”，便盲目地信以为真。董洪波到第一工区两个月中，未往采石场检查过一次。周、董均有官僚主义作风，致贪污延续八个月之久，始被发觉，造成人民财产的损失，各予以批评处分。
