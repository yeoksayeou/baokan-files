　　Golden Wheat Fields, Farmers Rejoice
    Summer Harvest Begins Across the Country
    Governments at All Levels Should Concentrate Their Efforts on Leading Harvesting and Seed Selection
    [Our Dispatch] The country has successively entered the tense summer harvest season. Early-maturing crops in North China are being marketed one after another, and barley and wheat are also about to mature. Farmers are repairing farm tools, tidying up threshing grounds, and preparing for harvesting. In most parts of the Northeast and Northwest, the season is later, and wheat will not be harvested for another month. In East China, Central South, and Shaanxi, barley is being harvested. In Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian and other places, the wheat harvest has been completed.
    According to estimates by the Central People's Government, this year's summer harvest crops nationwide cover more than 400 million mu. Except for individual areas where wheat has contracted jaundice, the overall growth is good, and farmers everywhere are happily welcoming the harvest. The more than 20 million mu of wheat in the Guanzhong Plain of Shaanxi are a sea of golden color, promising the most abundant harvest in twenty years. Wheat in Henan is growing well. In Xuchang Prefecture, the wheat seedlings in various counties are lush and the stalks are as high as a person's chest, and the yield may exceed the original target of increasing production by 14 jin per mu. Wheat fields in Shanxi are carefully cultivated, ensuring a good harvest. Shandong Province, with the exception of Cangshan, Pei County, Nanling, and Ni Mountain counties in central and southern Shandong, where wheat fields have been slightly damaged due to excessive rainfall, the province is experiencing a bumper harvest. The wheat harvest in Fujian broke the record of the past twenty years, with an average yield of 140 jin per mu. According to preliminary estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, a total of 262.37 million mu of wheat were planted in the three administrative regions of North China, East China, and Central South this year, which can produce more than 19 billion jin.
    After the early-maturing crops and new wheat are put on the market one after another, farmers can use this to tide over the spring famine. In Hefei, Shucheng, Chaoxian, and Lu'an counties in northern Anhui, after barley, broad beans, and peas were put on the market, poor tenant farmers who used to eat spring vegetables, wild vegetables and husks have switched to eating barley. At present, local people's governments have begun to transfer a large amount of coarse grains, calling on farmers to exchange coarse grains for fine grains, save their resources, and overcome the summer famine.
    In order to ensure the successful completion of the summer harvest, military and political committees and provincial governments in various places have successively issued orders and instructions, requiring governments at all levels to seize the time, concentrate their efforts, and lead farmers in carrying out the summer harvest; and to organize seed selection committees at all levels to conscientiously carry out seed selection and gradually realize the five-year plan for popularizing improved varieties.

　　麦田一片金黄农民欢欣鼓舞
    全国各地陆续进入夏收
    各级政府应集中力量领导收割和选种
    【本报讯】全国各地已陆续进入紧张的夏收季节。华北早熟作物陆续上市，大麦小麦亦将成熟，农民正在添修农具，整顿麦场，准备收割。东北、西北大部地区，季节较晚，小麦尚须一月始能收割。华东、中南及陕西等地正在收割大麦。两广、四川、云南、贵州、福建等地小麦已收割完毕。
    据中央人民政府估计，今年全国夏收作物约四亿余亩。除个别地区小麦发生黄疸病外，一般生长良好，各地农民均欢欣迎接丰收。陕西关中平原二千余万亩小麦，一片金黄，可获得二十年来未有的丰收。河南小麦发育良好，许昌专区各县麦苗旺盛，麦棵高及人胸，产量可超过原订每亩增产十四斤的任务。山西麦田耕作精细，可保丰收。山东除鲁中南苍山、沛县、南陵、尼山等县麦田，因雨水过多，略受损失外，全省丰收。福建小麦的收获量，打破了二十年来的纪录，每亩产量平均一百四十斤。据中央人民政府农业部初步估计：今年华北、华东、中南三个行政区，共种麦二六二三七万亩，可产一百九十亿余斤。
    各地早熟作物及新麦源源上市后，农民得此接口粮食，即已安度春荒。皖北合肥、舒城、巢县、六安等县，大麦、蚕豆、豌豆上市后，过去贫佃农以春菜、野菜和食者，已改食大麦。现各地人民政府已开始调运大批粗粮，号召农民以粗换细，节约度日，克服夏荒。
    为了保证胜利完成夏收，各地军政委员会及省政府均先后发布命令指示，要求各级政府抓紧时间，集中力量，领导农民进行夏收；并组织各级选种委员会，认真进行选种，逐步实现五年普及良种的计划。
