    Important Notice to Post Offices in Various Regions Regarding Taking Over Distribution Work
    I. When post offices in various regions take over newspaper and magazine distribution work, all existing private distribution organizations in those regions should maintain their current status. They must not be disrupted or abolished without the approval of this Bureau.

    V. All agencies, newsstands, news vendors, and newsboys must accept the management and leadership of the local post office in their distribution work and must not violate distribution regulations.
    VI. Post offices in various regions should systematically register and organize local agencies, newsstands, news vendors, and newsboys, and hold regular consultations on issues such as how to adjust public and private distribution organizations after unified distribution and how to expand distribution work.
