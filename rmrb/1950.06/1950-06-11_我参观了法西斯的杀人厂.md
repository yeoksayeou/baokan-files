　　I Visited a Fascist Slaughterhouse
　　Liu Kaiqu

Recently, sculptor Mr. Liu Kaiqu, who went to Warsaw to attend the Polish Fine Arts Conference, visited a concentration camp and slaughterhouse set up by the German fascists during World War II on the German-Czech border. This article is his reflection after the visit. (Editor)

On April 20, 1950, we spent half a day visiting the German concentration camp and slaughterhouse in Oswiecini, near the German-Czech border, 286 kilometers from Warsaw.

The patriotic and hard-working Polish people suffered the most persecution and destruction in World War II because they bravely resisted fascist aggression and occupation. The Polish nation, with a population of less than 35 million, had 6 million victims; out of 3.2 million Jews in Poland, only 350,000 remained; half of Warsaw was razed to the ground; the buildings that were not destroyed were full of bullet marks. The fascists' crimes in Poland were multifaceted, and concentration camps and slaughterhouses were only one aspect of them.

There were 722 concentration camps of all sizes and four slaughterhouses in Poland. The concentration camp we visited covered 40 square kilometers and was located in a humid area with toxic water, a place where Poles usually did not want to live.

This was one of the large concentration camps of the German army in Poland, surrounded by double-layered electric fences. When the German army failed, it was destroyed in an attempt to eliminate the evidence of its heinous crimes. When the Soviet army arrived, there were still 7,000 kilograms of women's hair left, which had not been transported to Germany to be used as lining cloth. Western women's hair is very fine and light. How many women do we have to think of killing to get 7,000 kilograms of hair? And this 7,000 kilograms was still left over and not transported. Perhaps the fascists did not consider it a major crime of killing, so they did not burn it. In this concentration camp, there were thirty-five storage piles of victims' clothes. After being destroyed by Hitler's bandit army, six piles remained, but in these six piles alone, 308,820 sets of men's clothing and 806,255 sets of women's clothing, fully equipped and ready to be sent to the Germans to wear, were discovered. In the one and a half months from December 1944 to January 15, 1945, the German army transported 99,922 sets of children's clothing, 192,652 sets of women's clothing, and 222,269 sets of men's clothing, a total of 514,843 sets, of the victims' clothes to Germany. The slaughterhouse was a half-basement, with a train directly to the entrance. After the prisoners got off the train, the German army pretended that they were too dirty and unclean and needed to take a bath, saying that the basement was a bathhouse and ordered them to go down to take a bath. Luggage was placed outside, and they lined up to enter the underground corridor. After entering, regardless of men, women, old or young, they were stripped naked and forced into the slaughterhouse. The factory was decorated with fake shower funnels on the ceiling, so that the victims really thought they were going in for a bath. In an area of ​​210 square meters, 2,000 people had to be piled up. After the room was full, the door was closed tightly. There were four chimneys on the roof, and the German army released poison gas into the room from here. People could be killed every twenty minutes. Later, in order to save the cost of poison gas, it was changed to once every ten minutes. These poisoned corpses were picked out by the German army from some of the young and strong people who were to be victimized next time or the next time, to move them out of the slaughterhouse, cut off their hair, pull out their gold teeth, rings, and earrings, and then send them to the crematorium for incineration. These workers were poisoned to death together with others the next time after they finished moving. So many corpses needed a way out, so crematories were built. In 1943, four large crematories were built, which could incinerate 12,000 corpses every 24 hours. In August 1944, cremation reached its peak, with 24,000 bodies burned every day. According to the research and estimates of various reliable materials available, from 1941 until the defeat of the fascist German army, the fascist bandits killed a total of about 5 million people here.

The gate of hell, this is really the gate of hell. Even five years later, that place is still terribly gloomy, making people feel that as long as you step in, you will lose your life.

Such cruelty is unimaginable to any normal person. However, the imperialists, headed by the United States, are completely inhuman and want to create a third world war again, and want to prepare to persecute peace-loving people of all countries like the Hitler bandits.

The bandit Hitler was originally just a rogue. When he was at his peak, his gang was not very big; but he was able to give mankind such an earth-shattering disaster that had never happened before. One of the important reasons is that the peace-loving people of all countries did not resolutely and united to strike him and other imperialists who indulged him before and after the event. To love peace, we must first resolutely rise up to defend peace. Just loving peace, but not resolutely rising up to defend peace, and not uniting the scattered forces against aggressive war into a strong force, peace cannot be maintained. Imperialists do not love peace and want to instigate war. The people of all countries love peace and oppose war. Today, the people of all countries are not sitting at home waiting for peace, but are uniting to defend peace with collective strength. If the imperialists do not recognize this, they will inevitably be severely attacked by millions of people all over the world, just as the Hitler bandits were destroyed by the invincible artillery of the great Red Army.

The success of China's liberation has greatly increased the forces of peace. The Soviet Union and all new democratic countries have infinite hopes for the Chinese people. When I was in the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, I often met people who said to me: Stalin, Mao Zedong, and the new democratic countries are united hand in hand, and American imperialism is finished.

Because of visiting this concentration camp and this slaughterhouse, I especially feel the importance of opposing war and defending peace. The Chinese people must build a new China well under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, unite with all peace-loving people of all countries, and resolutely defend world peace. Our art circles must also use the power of art to publicize the importance of defending peace, expose the conspiracies of imperialism, and strive to build a new democratic society that will enjoy happiness forever.

Massacres like the one Poland experienced can be avoided. The great power of peace-loving people all over the world is invincible.

Everyone, arise! Support world peace and defend world peace!

### 我参观了法西斯的杀人厂

　　我参观了法西斯的杀人厂
    刘开渠
    最近到华沙去出席波兰造型美术会议的雕刻家刘开渠先生在德捷边境参观了第二次大战时德国法西斯所设的一个集中营和杀人厂，本文是他参观后的感想。（编者）
    我们于一九五○年四月二十日，去距华沙二百八十六公里，靠近德捷边境亚斯威辛（Oswiecini）的德国集中营与杀人厂里参观了半天。
    爱祖国、爱劳动的波兰人民，由于他们曾英勇反抗法西斯的侵略与占领，所以在这二次大战中，遭受的迫害与破坏也最惨。以三千五百万人口不到的波兰民族，竟有六百万人被害；全波兰有三百二十万犹太人，被杀剩了三十五万人；华沙城一半被夷为平地；未被破坏的建筑，满是弹痕。法西斯在波兰的罪行是多方面的，集中营与杀人厂仅只是其中之一方面。
    全波兰有大小集中营七百二十二个，杀人厂有四个。我们参观的这个集中营周围有四十方公里，是潮湿、水中有毒、平时波兰人都不愿住的地方。
    这是德军在波兰的大集中营中的一个，周围有双层电网围着。当德军失败时，曾加以破坏，以图消灭他们的滔天罪证。在苏军到达时，还剩有未曾运去德国作为做衬布之用的七千公斤女人头发。西洋女子的头发是很细很轻的，我们想想要杀多少妇女才能得到七千公斤头发？而这七千公斤还是剩下来未及运走的。也许是法西斯认为不算一个大的杀人罪证，所以未加焚烧。在这个集中营中，有三十五个堆被害人衣服的堆栈，经希特勒匪军破坏后还剩了六个，但仅仅在这六个堆栈中就发现了配备成套、预备送去德国人穿的、被害人的衣服有三十万八千八百二十套男服，八十万六千二百五十五套女衣。在一九四四年十二月至一九四五年一月十五日的一个半月里，德军运去德国的被害人的衣服，是童衣九万九千九百二十二套，女衣十九万二千六百五十二套，男衣二十二万二千二百六十九套，共为五十一万四千八百四十三套。杀人厂为一半地下室，进口处有火车直达。俘虏下车后，德军佯称他们太污浊不清洁，须洗澡，说地下室为澡堂，命他们下去洗澡。行李放在外边，排队入地下走廊。进去后，不管男女老少一律脱光，随被迫入杀人厂。此厂布置有假洗澡漏斗于天棚，让被害人真以为是进去洗澡的。二百一十方公尺的地方，须堆二千人。待人满后，即将门紧闭。屋顶上有四个烟囱，德军即将毒气从此放进室内。每二十分钟可杀人一次。后因为要经济毒气的费用，改为十分钟一次。这些被毒杀的尸首，由德军从下一次或再下次要被害的人中挑出若干年轻力壮的人，去搬出杀人厂，剪下头发，拔下金牙、戒指、耳环，然后送至尸炉焚烧。这些工作人于搬完后，即在下次同其他人一道毒死。这样多的尸首需要一个去路，于是造焚尸炉。一九四三年造了四个大的焚尸炉，每二十四小时可焚烧一万二千尸首。一九四四年八月焚尸达到了最高潮，每日烧毁二万四千具。根据现有的各种可靠材料的研究和估计，从一九四一年起到法西斯德军失败止，法西斯匪徒在此总杀有五百万人左右。
    鬼门关，这真是鬼门关，就是到了五年后的今天，那个地方还是阴惨的可怕，让人觉得只要一脚踏进门，就没有命了。
    这种残酷的情形是任何一个正常的人想象不出的。但以美国为首的帝国主义者，却全无人心的又想制造第三次世界大战，又想准备象希特勒匪帮一样地来残害爱和平的各国人民。
    匪徒希特勒原只是一个流氓，到了他最盛时，他的贼群也不大；但他居然能够这样惊天动地的给人类一次从来未有的大灾祸。其重要的原因之一，就因为爱和平的各国人民没有事前事后坚决地、一致起来痛击他、痛击放纵他的其他帝国主义者的缘故。爱和平，必须先坚决地起来保卫和平。光是爱和平，而不坚决地起来保卫和平，不把反对侵略战争的分散的力量汇合成一个坚强的力量，和平是保不住的。帝国主义者不爱和平，要挑动战争。各国人民爱和平，反对战争。今天的各国人民不是坐在家里等和平，而是团结起来，以集体的力量来保卫和平。如果帝国主义者不认清这一点，它必遭全世界千百万人民的一致的痛击，如同希特勒匪帮被伟大红军的无敌大炮所毁灭一样。
    中国解放成功，和平力量大增。苏联、各新民主主义国家都对中国人民抱有无穷的希望。我在苏联、波兰、捷克时常遇见人对我说：斯大林、毛泽东，新民主主义国家握手团结，美帝国主义者完蛋。
    由于参观了这个集中营，这个杀人厂，所以我格外觉到反对战争，保卫和平的重要。中国人民必须在毛主席和共产党的英明领导之下建设好新中国，并与一切爱好和平的各国人民联合起来，坚决地保卫世界和平。我们艺术界更要以艺术的力量宣传保卫和平的重要，揭发帝国主义的阴谋，为建设永享幸福的新民主主义社会而奋斗到底。
    象波兰所遭遇的这样的大屠杀是可以避免的，全世界爱好和平者的伟大力量是无敌的。
    大家起来！拥护世界和平，保卫世界和平！
