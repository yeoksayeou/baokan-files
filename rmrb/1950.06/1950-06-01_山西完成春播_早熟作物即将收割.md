Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th: Shanxi Province has completed its spring planting work according to plan before the end of May. A total of 33 million mu of grain crops, 2.2 million mu of cotton, and 420,000 mu of tobacco, peanuts, and hemp have been sown. In order to enable farmers in some non-wheat-producing areas to safely get through the summer famine, the People's Government called for the planting of early-maturing crops such as spring wheat, barley, summer naked oats, and peas. A total of 1.5 million mu have been planted, and they are growing well and will be harvested by Mangzhong (June 7th).

The people's governments at all levels in Shanxi Province have paid close attention to the leadership of this year's spring plowing and production work. First, the provincial, special district, and county people's governments dispatched a total of more than 2,000 cadres to organize inspection groups or inspection teams, led by responsible cadres themselves, to go to the countryside to check the implementation of policies and the execution of plans, so as to ensure the realization of the task of increasing grain and cotton production. Secondly, the policy of organizing was implemented to improve farmers' productivity. The old areas, in conjunction with the intensive spring plowing preparations, rectified the original labor mutual aid organizations, and the new areas also developed mutual aid groups. This improved the quality of spring plowing. Due to the universal organization of labor mutual aid groups, the amount of fertilizer applied in the Changzhi Special District increased by an average of 10 dan per mu compared with last year, and the requirement of two plowings and two harrows was generally achieved; the amount of fertilizer applied in the new areas this year generally exceeded 50% of last year. Advanced areas such as Pingshun, Licheng, Lucheng, Huguan, Yushe, and Wuxiang even used surplus labor for land processing. Thirdly, the government paid attention to the improvement of crops and the guidance of cultivation techniques. In order to improve varieties, the government invested 500,000 jin of millet, so that the planting area of high-quality cotton and grain varieties increased to 500,000 mu. The work of seed disinfection has been carried out quite universally. Taking Heshun as an example in the old area, 80% of the land after disinfection and sowing reached the sowing area, and Pingyao in the new area also reached 30%. Fourthly, during the spring plowing period, the Provincial People's Government announced a series of policies to reward production, protect the ownership of land property of all classes after land reform, and resolutely implement the policy of "whoever sows, reaps" in areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, which played a great role in dispelling farmers' concerns about being "outstanding" and not daring to work hard to become rich.

In order to prevent seedlings from being damaged by wind, hail, and insect pests after they emerge, farmers in Wuxiang, Jiexiu, Yuxian, Pingyao, Huo County, and other places have formed seedling protection and disaster prevention committees to fight against natural disasters. Thirteen villages in the first district of Wuxiang protected 13,000 mu of autumn seedlings by means of lighting fires to prevent frost. However, according to a province-wide survey, some villages in 16 counties have found frost damage, and some villages in 33 counties have found insect pests. Therefore, seedling protection work still needs to be carried out vigorously in various places.

### 山西完成春播  早熟作物即将收割

　　山西完成春播
    早熟作物即将收割
    【新华社太原二十九日电】山西省春季播种工作已按计划在五月底前完成，共下种谷物三千三百万亩，棉花二百二十万亩，烟叶、花生、麻共四十二万亩。为使部分非产麦地区农民安然度过夏荒，人民政府曾号召播种春小麦、大麦、夏莜麦、豌豆等早熟作物，一共种了一百五十万亩，现已长得很好，到芒种（六月七日）就可收割。
    山西省各级人民政府对于今年春耕生产工作的领导是抓得相当紧的。首先，省、专区和县人民政府总共抽调了两千多干部，组织检查团或检查组，由负责干部亲自率领下乡，检查政策的贯彻与计划的执行，以保证粮棉增产任务的实现。其次，贯彻组织起来的方针，以提高农民生产力。老区结合紧张的春耕准备工作整顿了原有的劳动互助组织，新区互助组也有发展。这样便提高了春耕的质量。由于普遍地组织了劳动互助组，长治专区施肥量比去年平均每亩增肥十担，普遍做到耕二耙二的要求；新区今年的施肥量一般超过去年的百分之五十。平顺、黎城、潞城、壶关、榆社、武乡等先进地区，更将剩余劳力用在土地加工上面。再次，政府注意了对于农作物的改良和耕作技术的指导。为了改良品种，政府投资五十万斤小米，使棉粮优良品种的播种面积增达五十万亩。种籽消毒的工作已相当普遍地进行。老区以和顺为例，经过消毒播种的田地达播种面积的百分之八十，新区平遥也达到百分之三十。第四，省人民政府在春耕期间公布了奖励生产，保障土地改革后各阶层土地财产所有权，在未实行土地改革地区坚决贯彻谁种谁收等一系列政策，对解除农民怕“冒尖”的不敢劳动发家致富的顾虑起了很大作用。
    为防备禾苗出土后受风、雹、虫灾害，武乡、介休、盂县、平遥、霍县等地农民组成了保苗防灾委员会，向自然灾害作斗争。武乡一区十三个村以点火防冻的办法，保护了一万三千亩秋苗。但据全省调查，有十六个县的部分村庄发现冻灾、三十三个县的部分村庄发现虫害，因此保苗工作各地仍须大力进行。
