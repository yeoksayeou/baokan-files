Creating the Necessary Conditions for Peaceful Reunification
    National Traitors Syngman Rhee, etc., Should Be Arrested; "United Nations Commission on Korea" Should Leave Korea Immediately
    4. In order to achieve the peaceful reunification of the country and enable the all-Korean legislative body to conduct normal activities, the following necessary conditions must be created: A. Arrest national traitors such as Syngman Rhee, Kim Seong-su, Lee Beom-seok, Shin Sung-mo, Chae Byeong-deok, Baek Seong-uk, Jo Byeong-ok, Yun Chi-yeong, and Shin Heung-woo, who are the chief culprits hindering the peaceful reunification of the motherland; B. Guarantee freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and demonstration; C. Stop the suppression of all democratic political parties, social organizations, and their representatives, release all political prisoners, and guarantee full freedom for all democratic political parties and social organizations to conduct activities.
    5. The government formed by the legislative body should, on a democratic basis, reorganize the existing armies, police, and security forces in North and South Korea into a single army, police, and security force.
    6. Demand that the "United Nations Commission on Korea," the tool of American imperialism for implementing its policy of division and colonization in Korea, leave Korea immediately. The Korean people must reject foreign interference and solve the problem of their country's peaceful reunification by their own strength.
    7. All measures related to the peaceful reunification of the country must be fully implemented before the fifth anniversary of the "August 15th" Liberation Day.
    8. If the South Korean "National Assembly" agrees, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is prepared to send a delegation to Seoul on June 21st, or to meet with the South Korean "National Assembly" delegation in Pyongyang.
