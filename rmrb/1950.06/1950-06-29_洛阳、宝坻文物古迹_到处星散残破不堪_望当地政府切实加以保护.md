　　(I) To the Editor:
　　The Guangji Temple in Baodi County, Hebei Province, was built in the fifth year of the Liao Dynasty's Taiping era and is one of China's well-preserved ancient wooden structures. After Baodi was liberated in 1947, County Head Yu Sheng actually petitioned the 15th Special Prefecture to approve its complete demolition to build the Bailonggang Bridge in the county's 13th District. Now, the temple's three main halls have been flattened into earthen platforms, with only four remaining steles. This is a loss to China's cultural heritage.
　　I believe that the county head's rash demolition of the temple and the special prefecture's approval without understanding the situation both demonstrate a lack of regard for the people's cultural heritage. I hope they will conduct a public self-criticism.

　　(II) To the Editor:
　　Last autumn, I taught at a middle school in Luoyang and saw that the local cultural relics and historic sites were dilapidated and scattered everywhere. People were even using carved stones as steps. Your newspaper's recent call to "Protect Ancient Relics and Cultural Heritage, Oppose Destruction" is worthy of serious attention from leading organs in various regions.
　　The stone Buddha statues at Longmen (anciently called Yique) in Luoyang are cliff carvings dating from the Northern Wei to the Sui and Tang dynasties. According to the Wei Shu records, the construction lasted for as long as twenty-four years, employing more than 800,000 laborers. The mountains are filled with stone statues, the largest being 86 feet tall and the smallest being only an inch. Their expressions are ever-changing, and their artistic value is comparable to the stone Buddha statues in Dunhuang and Yungang. However, due to the reactionary government's years of theft and sale and the lack of supervision, many statues have been beheaded and their bodies damaged.
　　The Civil Education Center in the city houses more than eighty stone carvings, including the Three-Script Stone Classics and ancient epitaphs and statues, mostly scattered in the rooms and courtyards. The stone steps at the west end of the north house of the city's Bureau of Culture and Education are actually rubbings of Yue Fei's cursive script scrolls. One is a stone carving from the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. The backyard of the Dingding Hall of the Zhougong Temple outside Xiguan originally had a small stone forest, which was a collection of Tang and Song dynasty epitaphs, about three hundred pieces. However, the east wing has completely collapsed, and many epitaphs are buried underneath. Moreover, the courtyard wall is incomplete, and the door has no lock, and it is estimated that they are likely to be damaged or lost at any time.
　　I hope that the relevant departments will formulate regulations for the preservation of cultural relics as soon as possible, so as to properly preserve the existing cultural relics and historic sites.

　　(III) To the Editor:
　　Yungang is located more than ten miles west of Datong City and has stone Buddha temples, which are great sculptural artworks of the Northern Wei Dynasty. Due to years of disrepair and lack of management, weeds grow in the halls, and the stairs are damaged. Many stone Buddhas have also been damaged. I hope that the Datong City Sixth District Government and the Sixth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will find ways to quickly protect them!

### 洛阳、宝坻文物古迹  到处星散残破不堪  望当地政府切实加以保护

　　洛阳、宝坻文物古迹
    到处星散残破不堪
    望当地政府切实加以保护
  （一）编辑同志：
    河北宝坻县广济寺，建造于辽太平五年，是我国保存完整的古代木构建筑物之一。一九四七年宝坻解放后，县长于生同志竟呈请十五专署批准，将其全部拆毁，修建了该县十三区的白龙港大桥。现在，该寺三大殿已平毁为土台，仅剩有残碑四统。这是中国文化遗产上的一个损失。
    我认为该县县长如此轻率地拆毁该寺，而该专署未经了解情况即予批准，都是对人民的文化遗产不加重视的具体表现。我希望他们进行公开检讨。

  （二）编辑同志：
    去年秋天，我在洛阳某中学教书，见到当地的文物古迹残破不堪，到处星散。人们或用刻石作石阶。日前贵报发出“保护古迹文物，反对破坏”的号召，是值得各地领导机关严重注意的。
    洛阳龙门（古称伊阙）之石佛造像龛，系北魏以至隋唐的摩崖造像。据魏书记载：营造时间达二十四年之久，用工八十余万。两山石像累累，大者八丈六尺，小者盈寸。神态千变万化，其艺术价值，可与敦煌、云岗石佛像相比拟。但因反动政府历年盗卖，无人看管，致使造像多被碎首损躯。
    城内民教馆，藏有三体石经及古碑志、造像等石刻八十余件，多散置于屋内院中。该市文教局北屋西头两块石阶石，则系岳飞草书手卷刻石之题跋。其一为明万历年刻石。西关外周公庙定鼎堂后院，原造有小型碑林，系唐宋碑志，约三百余件。但东厢房已全部倒塌，碑志多埋在下面，而且院墙残缺，门无锁钥，估计随时都有可能损毁或散失。
    我希望有关方面能早日订出保管文物的条例，以便把现有的文物古迹妥善地保存起来。

    云岗在大同市西十余里，有石佛古寺，为北魏时代的巨大雕刻艺术杰作。因年久失修，管理乏人。现殿阁内杂草丛生，楼梯缺损。石佛亦多毁损。希望大同市六区政府及中共六区区委会设法迅速加以保护！
