　　Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, Issues Statement Condemning MacArthur's Persecution of the Japanese Communist Party
    [This newspaper dispatch] China National Revolutionary Committee Chairman Li Jishen issued a statement to oppose MacArthur's illegal and violent act of removing twenty-four central committee members of the Japanese Communist Party from public office and banning all their political activities. The statement is as follows:
    Recently, the Japanese Communist Party led the patriotic people in opposing the "separate peace" of the Yoshida Cabinet, a running dog of American imperialism, and launched an extraordinarily heroic struggle since the American military occupation. MacArthur could not stop this just struggle, and openly ordered the removal of twenty-four members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party from public office and the cessation of all their political activities as a means of retaliation. This stupid and illegal act only shows that the American imperialists are at a loss in the face of the Asian people's liberation movement, and can only use violent suppression of legitimate struggles, vainly attempting to maintain their unilateral occupation policy for a while, and further to deprive the Japanese people of their basic freedoms, in order to fulfill their conspiracy to arrange a new war. The democracy, freedom and basic human rights that the American imperialists love to flaunt on a daily basis are here more clearly exposed in their true colors.
    MacArthur continuously releases Japanese war criminals on the one hand, and severely suppresses the rise of democratic movements on the other. There is an internal connection between these two actions. He believes that the result of condoning the right wing to suppress the left wing can revive the fascist forces in Japan, and that he can use this notoriously evil force to launch an offensive against the peace-loving people of the Far East—especially the Chinese people—in order to expand its sphere of influence and restore its lost colonies or semi-colonies. I believe that such arrogant behavior by the American imperialists will inevitably lead to a disastrous defeat in the future. Just look at the present: Japanese workers, students, and patriotic people in general are launching general alliance strikes, class boycotts, and speeches against MacArthur's "purge" order, expressing their protests. The American Worker's Daily is also accusing "MacArthur of now implementing the notorious thought control decree of the Japanese militarists." All these internal resistance actions and speeches will combine with the strength of the peace-loving and democratic people of the world to form an incomparably heroic and powerful front, so that the American occupation authorities will one day have to stop their violent behavior and end their unilateral and unreasonable rule early, so that Japan can obtain independence and democracy under the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty, and that the people of the Far East can fundamentally eliminate the threat of war.

　　民革主席李济深发表谈话  斥麦克阿瑟迫害日共
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深为反对麦克阿瑟撤除日共二十四名中央委员的公职，并摈斥其一切政治活动的非法暴行，特发表谈话如下：
    最近日本共产党领导爱国人民，反对美帝走狗吉田内阁的“单独议和”，展开了自美军占领以来无比英勇的斗争。麦克阿瑟对于这个正义的斗争无法制止，竟公然下令撤除日共中央委员二十四人的公职，并停止他们的一切政治活动来作为报复手段。这种蠢笨而非法的暴行，徒然表示美帝国主义者面临亚洲人民解放运动而无所措其手足，只有用暴力镇压合法的斗争，妄图他们片面的占领政策能够苟安于一时，并进一步来剥夺日本人民的基本自由，以遂其布置新战争的阴谋诡计。美帝国主义者日常所爱标榜的民主自由与基本人权，在这里更显明的暴露出它的本来面目了。
    麦克阿瑟一面连续地释放日本战争罪犯，一面严酷地镇压民主运动的抬头，这其间有它的内在关联。它以为纵容右翼压制左翼的结果，可以使日本法西斯势力死灰复燃，并且可以利用这种罪恶昭彰的势力来向远东的和平人民——特别是中国人民进行攻势，以扩张它的支配范围，并恢复它已经失去的殖民地或半殖民地。我以为美帝国主义者这种狂妄的行为，将来必然会招致惨败。就看现在：日本的工人、学生及一般爱国人民，针对着麦克阿瑟的“整肃”命令，正在进行总同盟罢工、罢课、演讲，纷纷表示抗议，美国的工人日报也在指责“麦克阿瑟现在又在实行日本军国主义者臭名昭彰的思想控制法令”。这一切内在的反抗行动和言论，将与全世界爱好和平民主的人民的力量相结合，形成无比英勇强大的阵线，使美国占领当局终有一天不得不停止其狂暴的行为，并提早结束其片面的无理统治，使日本在全面和约签订之下，获得独立和民主，使远东人民根本消灭战争的威胁。
