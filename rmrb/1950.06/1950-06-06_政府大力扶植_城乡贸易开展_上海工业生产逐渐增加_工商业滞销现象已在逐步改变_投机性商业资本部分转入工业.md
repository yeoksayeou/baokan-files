　　Government Strongly Supports · Urban and Rural Trade Development
    Shanghai's Industrial Production Gradually Increases
    The Phenomenon of Sluggish Sales in Industry and Commerce is Gradually Changing
    Speculative Commercial Capital Partially Shifts to Industry
    [Report from this Newspaper] According to a report from the *Jiefang Daily*: Except for a portion of Shanghai's industrial and commercial enterprises that have failed to face the masses and actively change their style, with the strong support of the government, since late April, the difficulties encountered by various industries since March, such as sluggish sales and tight capital turnover, have gradually been alleviated. This is particularly evident in industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

    The signs of this improvement are first reflected in the increased production volume of several industries compared to the low period. The trading volume of market commodities has also increased due to the gradual unblocking of urban and rural material exchanges. In particular, some speculative commercial capital has partially shifted to industrial production. From late April to the end of the month, the production of several industries in the city began to gradually increase. Nearly one million spindles in the private cotton textile industry began to spin. In terms of output, cloth production in the fourth week of April was 38,060 bolts, which increased to 42,723 bolts in the second week of May. The average weekly yarn production also reached more than 6,000 pieces. Among the 31 iron and steel smelting industries, 23 had started operations in April, which increased to 29 in May, and another two are preparing to resume production. Industries such as electrical equipment, dyeing and weaving, and papermaking have also seen a turnaround. According to statistics, Shanghai's electricity production in May was 11.34 million kilowatt-hours in the first week, 12.46 million kilowatt-hours in the second week, and 12.88 million kilowatt-hours in the third week. Comparing the average index in May with that of April, there was an increase of 11 percent, and an increase of 14 percent compared to March. This situation also reflects the alleviation of production difficulties in industry and commerce.

    With the gradual recovery of some industrial production, private banks and firms have gradually expanded their business. For example, the loans issued by Ju Xingcheng Bank increased from 2.8 billion yuan at the end of April to 3.9 billion yuan in mid-May, and the United Bank also increased by 1.3 billion yuan. Many banks and firms have also gradually reduced, recovered, or renewed non-performing loans. Commercial enterprises that have oriented their business towards the masses have also seen improvements. For example, the sales volume of the six major department stores, Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, New China Emporium, China National Goods, and Lai Wah, averaged approximately 180 million yuan per day in the fourth week of April. This gradually increased thereafter, reaching an average of over 320 million yuan per day in the third week of May, an increase of 75 percent. The sales volume index (with the average volume in December of last year as 100) increased from 42.3 to 99.5, breaking the highest record of the average of each week and month since the New Year, approaching the level of December last year. In addition, wholesale markets and over-the-counter transactions have also increased: the trading volume index of eight major commodities was higher in the third and fourth weeks of May than in the second week. Taking yarn factories as an example of over-the-counter transactions, 877 pieces were sold in the second week of May, 1,010 pieces in the third week, and 1,242 pieces in the fourth week. The third week increased by 16 percent compared to the second week, and the fourth week increased by 22 percent compared to the third week. These phenomena indicate that the overall market transaction is gradually trending towards recovery and activity.

    In terms of urban and rural material exchange, there has also been some progress. From May 2nd to 29th, private merchants transported a total of more than 78,000 *shi* of food rice to Shanghai, an increase of 67 percent compared to the entire month of April. The arrival of edible oil also exceeded 10,000 *dan*, an increase of 20 percent compared to April. The sales volume of cotton yarn since the third week of May has been above 1,000 pieces per week.

    Another situation indicating the normal development of the city's industry and commerce is the gradual increase in the transfer of commercial capital with a considerable speculative nature into industrial production. These are mostly wholesale firms that relied on excessive profits for survival in the past. According to incomplete investigation data: recently, more than ten companies have started or are preparing to transfer funds into production. For example, Qingcheng Pigment Company merged 1.2 billion yuan into Qingcheng Pigment Company to engage in production. Zhicheng New Paper Company invested 860 million yuan into Jincheng Paper Factory, and more than 200 million yuan of inventory will be sold off and prepared for investment in production. Kunhe Hardware Company transferred 168.8 million yuan to Dahua Rope Factory, and another 300 million yuan will continue to be invested. Maotaiheng Sugar Firm invested 78 million yuan to jointly establish Hetai Silk Factory in Wuxi with Zhonghe Sugar Firm and Guohua Silk Factory. Jiuchang Industrial Raw Material Company invested over 400 million yuan into Changcheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Yongda Industrial Raw Material Firm merged 120 million yuan into Boss Chemical Factory, and Daxing Industrial Raw Material Firm transferred 20 million yuan to Daxingyong Chemical Factory. The transformation of these commercial capitals began under the circumstances that commercial speculation and excessive profits are gradually eliminated and legitimate industrial and commercial activities are profitable. As long as they can overcome blindness and anarchy in management, it will be beneficial to the country's economic construction and their own future.

　　政府大力扶植·城乡贸易开展
    上海工业生产逐渐增加
    工商业滞销现象已在逐步改变
    投机性商业资本部分转入工业
    【本报讯】据解放日报消息：上海市工商业除部分未能面向大众、积极转变作风者外，经过政府的大力扶植，从四月下旬开始，各行业自三月份以来所遭遇的销路呆滞和资金周转不灵的困难，已在逐步减轻，特别是有利于国计民生的工商业表现得最明显。
    此种好转的迹象，首先表现在若干工业生产量已较低落时期增加，市场商品的交易量亦因城乡物资交流渐畅而增多，特别是有些带有投机性的商业资金已有部分转入工业生产。从四月下旬起至月底止，该市若干工业生产开始逐步增加。私营棉纺业即有近百万纱锭开始转动，产量方面，四月份第四周产布三万八千零六十匹，到五月份第二周即增至四万二千七百二十三匹，产纱量平均每周亦达六千余件。三十一家钢铁炼制工业在四月份开工者即已达二十三家，五月份又增为二十九家，另有二家亦准备复工。电工器材、染织、造纸等工业均有了转机。据统计，五月份沪市电力生产量，第一周为一千一百三十四万度，第二周为一千二百四十六万度，第三周为一千二百八十八万度，以五月份平均指数与四月份相比较，计增加了百分之十一，较三月份则增加了百分之十四。这种情况也可以反映出工商业生产困难的减轻。
    随着某些工业生产的逐渐恢复，私营行庄业务已逐步开展。如聚兴诚银行放款由四月底二十八亿至五月中增为三十九亿元，联合银行亦增加十三亿。放出的呆账方面，不少行庄亦已逐渐减少、收回、或转期。营业方针面向大众的商业亦有起色。如永安、先施、大新、新新、中国国货、丽华六大百货公司销货额四月第四周平均每天约一亿八千万，此后逐渐增加，五月第三周平均每天达三亿二千余万，激增七成半，销货量指数（以去年十二月平均量为一○○）从四二·三增至九九·五，打破了新年以来各月各周平均的最高纪录，接近去年十二月份的水平。此外，批发市场及场外交易也均有增加：八种主要商品交易量指数五月第三、四两周均较第二周为高，场外交易以纱厂为例，五月第二周售出八百七十七件，第三周一千零一十件，第四周达一千二百四十二件，第三周较第二周增加百分之一六，第四周又较第三周增加百分之二二。这些现象，表示了整个市场交易已逐渐趋向恢复和活跃。
    在城乡物资的交流方面，亦有了些进展。自五月二日至二十九日止，私商运沪食米共达七万八千余石，较四月份全月增加百分之六七，食油到货亦逾万担，较四月份增加百分之二○；棉纱客销数量自五月第三周起，每周均在一千件以上。
    表示该市工商业走向正常发展的另一情况是带有相当浓厚投机性的商业资本转入工业生产的在逐渐增加中。这些大多是过去经营批发字号，依靠超额利润生存者。根据不完全的调查资料：最近以来，开始或已准备将资金转入生产的已有十余家，其中如：庆成颜料号十二亿资金合并到庆成颜料公司从事生产，志成新纸号资金八亿六千万投入金城造纸厂，另有二亿余存货售脱后亦准备投资生产，坤和五金号资金一亿六千八百万转入大华绳索厂，尚有三亿资金亦将继续投入，贸泰恒糖行七千八百万资金与中和糖行、国华丝厂联合于无锡开设和泰丝厂，久昌工业原料号四亿余资金投入长城染织厂，永大工业原料行一亿二千万资金并入波斯化工厂，大兴工业原料号资金二千万转入达兴永化工厂。这些商业资本的转变，是在商业投机和超额利润逐渐消灭、正当工商业有利可图的情况下开始的，只要能够克服经营上的盲目性和无政府状态，对国家经济建设及其本身前途都是有利的。
