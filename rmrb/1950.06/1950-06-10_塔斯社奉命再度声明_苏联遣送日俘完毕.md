　　TASS Authorized to Reiterate
    Soviet Union Completes Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners of War
    US and Japanese officials maliciously slander the Soviet Union, with the aim of diverting the Japanese people's attention from the US's policy of enslaving Japan.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 9th] TASS Moscow, 9th: As American and Japanese officials have repeatedly issued statements regarding the number of Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union, and various false rumors are being spread by reactionary foreign newspapers, TASS is authorized to issue the following statement:
    On May 20, 1949, the representative of the Soviet Council of Ministers for the repatriation of prisoners of war pointed out in a statement: as of May 1, 1949, of all the 594,000 Japanese officers and soldiers captured, 418,166 had been repatriated to Japan, not counting the 70,880 released locally in war zones. The statement also pointed out that as of May 1, 1949, 95,000 who had not been repatriated remained in the Soviet Union.
    The "Statement on the Completion of the Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners of War by the Soviet Union," issued by TASS on April 22, 1950, officially stated that the 95,000 Japanese prisoners of war who remained in the Soviet Union as of May 1949 had been completely repatriated. Those not yet repatriated included: 1,487 prisoners of war who had been convicted or were being investigated for war crimes, nine prisoners of war who would be repatriated after medical treatment, and 971 prisoners of war who had committed serious crimes against the Chinese people and were being transferred to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The TASS statement pointed out that all Japanese prisoners of war had been repatriated from the Soviet Union.
    Despite the detailed and exhaustive statistics provided in these official statements, the United States and Japan are spreading fabricated information, insisting that a large number of Japanese prisoners of war remain in the Soviet Union.
    TASS is authorized to declare: The information spread by the aforementioned foreign individuals is in the nature of malicious slander against the Soviet Union, and its purpose is to divert the Japanese people's attention from the policy of economic and political enslavement of Japan pursued by the United States.

　　塔斯社奉命再度声明
    苏联遣送日俘完毕
    美日官方人士恶意诽谤苏联，  目的在于使日本人民不注意美对日实行奴役政策。
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：因为关于在苏联的日本战俘人数一节，美国和日本的官方人士一再发表声明，而且外国反动报纸散播各种虚妄的消息，塔斯社奉命特发表声明如下：
    一九四九年五月二十日，苏联部长会议委派的遣俘事务代表在声明中指出：至一九四九年五月一日为止，在所有被俘的五十九万四千名日军官兵中，已有四十一万八千一百六十六名被遣回日本，在战争地区当地释放的七万零八百八十名不计在内。声明并且指出：到一九四九年五月一日为止，尚有九万五千名未被遣送者留在苏联。
    塔斯社于一九五○年四月二十二日发表的“关于苏联遣送日本战争俘虏完毕的声明”中正式指出：截至一九四九年五月为止尚留在苏联境内的日本战俘九万五千人，已经遣送完毕。尚未遣送者有：一千四百八十七名已定罪的和正在调查其战争罪行的战俘，九名将在医疗完毕后遣送回国的战俘，以及九百七十一名对中国人民犯了严重罪行而且正在移交给中华人民共和国中央人民政府的战俘。塔斯社声明中指出：日本战俘已从苏联全部遣送完毕。
    尽管这些正式的声明中提供了详尽无遗的统计数字，美国和日本却在散布捏造的消息，硬说尚有大量日本战俘留在苏联境内。
    塔斯社奉命声明：上述外国人士所散播的消息，具有恶意诽谤苏联的性质，其目的，在于使日本人民不去注意美国对日本实行的经济与政治奴役的政策。
