　　Saving Physical Labor, Increasing Production
　　Soviet Steel Production Adopts Automated Machinery
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Stalinoro, 3rd] TASS reports: Last year, eight-tenths of all steel products in the Donbas were produced by automated Martin furnaces. Automatic devices have also been more widely used in blast furnace and rolled metal production. In metallurgical factories, many automatic devices have exceeded pre-war levels by several times. Mechanical devices regulate the temperature of Martin furnaces, charge blast furnaces, and regulate heating equipment in the rolled metal sector.

　　The work of completely mechanizing and automating all production processes, from the unloading of raw materials to the transportation of finished products, is being carried out extensively. To meet this objective, mechanized departments have been organized and existing metallurgical machinery factories have been expanded. Stakhanovite workers and engineers working in petroleum enterprises have designed many new machines and mechanical devices. These machines and mechanical devices will save labor in steel and iron smelting or metal rolling.

　　Mechanized conveyor systems have been established in the rolling mill of the Kirov "Makeyev" factory and the "Azov" steel plant. Due to the saving of physical labor throughout the entire metallurgical process, the number of workers can be reduced by fifty percent, but the production of products has almost doubled.

    苏钢铁生产采用自动机械
    【新华社讯】塔斯社斯大林诺三日电：去年在顿巴斯的全部钢产品的十分之八是由自动马丁炉生产的。自动装置在鼓风炉及辗金属生产方面也已得到更大的应用。在冶金工厂，许多自动装置超过战前水准数倍之多。机械调节马丁炉的温度，为鼓风炉装料并调节在辗金部门的发热设备。
    自原料的卸下一直到制成品的运送为止，所有生产过程全面机械化和自动化的工作，正在广泛进行。为适应这个目的，机械化部门已经组织起来，现有的冶金机器工厂已经扩充。在石油企业工作的斯塔哈诺夫工作者及工程师已经设计了许多新的机器和机械。这些机器和机械将在熔钢与熔铁或辗金属方面省去劳力。
    机械化的传送系统已经在基洛夫“马基耶夫”工厂的辗金间及“亚速夫”钢厂建立起来。在冶金工作的全部过程中，由于体力劳动的节省，工作的人数可以减少百分之五十，但产品的生产几乎增加了二倍。
