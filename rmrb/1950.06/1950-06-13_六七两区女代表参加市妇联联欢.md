　　[Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon (the 12th), the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation held a gathering in its conference hall with all the women representatives of the People's Representative Conferences from the sixth and seventh districts of the city. Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Municipal Women's Federation, encouraged the representatives to study culture, learn skills, unite the masses, unite and organize the women of their respective districts, and better serve the people, and not to become proud because they are representatives. Liu Qingyang, Vice-Chairman of the Municipal Women's Federation, also spoke in succession. Afterwards, the representatives spoke enthusiastically. Zhao Xiuwei said, "We must truly come from the masses and go to the masses, and unite the women of our district." Ding Jiayu, a housewife, said, "District representatives can be like a family, discussing the affairs of the district, and this is all thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao."
