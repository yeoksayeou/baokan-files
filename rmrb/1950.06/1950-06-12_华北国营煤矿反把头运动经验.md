Experiences in the Anti-Ba Tou Movement in State-Owned Coal Mines in North China
Chinese Coal Miners Union North China Preparatory Committee

The movement to abolish the Ba Tou system in state-owned coal mines in North China was launched successively in April. The anti-Ba Tou movement in Yangquan Mine has ended; the Jiaozuo Mine is also nearing completion; and some units are continuing to carry it out. Based on the experiences of various mines in abolishing the Ba Tou system, the following points are shared:

I. Unifying guiding ideology and clarifying policies and guidelines are fundamental links in carrying out the anti-Ba Tou movement. In the past, many mine leaders regarded Ba Tous as technical personnel for a considerable period, believing that production would be impossible without them. Some mine leaders believed that since they had opposed local bullies, combated corruption, and reformed the labor organization, the Ba Tou system no longer existed. This is the main reason why Ba Tou remnants were able to exist for a long time. Therefore, to completely abolish the Ba Tou system, it is necessary to first clarify and unify the thinking of leading cadres. It is also necessary to clearly announce the policies and guidelines for abolishing the Ba Tou system to dispel workers' doubts and encourage them to act boldly. The working class should be fully mobilized, relying on their consciousness to resolutely and thoroughly abolish the Ba Tou system and establish a team leader responsibility system; at the same time, improve the management committee and workers' congress, and strengthen the connection between the factory and the workers, so as to achieve democratic management and business enterprise. In implementing policies, be cautious and serious, treat Ba Tous differently, and implement the policy of transformation and education. The movement should be openly led by the trade union. All issues should be discussed by administrative, Party, trade union, and youth league groups and employee representative meetings, and then executed by administrative order. This will ensure that the movement progresses steadily in a planned and step-by-step manner.

II. Full and thorough preparation is a prerequisite for carrying out the anti-Ba Tou movement. The anti-Ba Tou movement is a mass democratic reform movement. Only by truly mobilizing the masses can the success of the movement be guaranteed. First of all, in-depth publicity and mobilization should be carried out, using blackboards, propaganda teams, small worker forums, visits to veteran workers' families, and other methods to expose the crimes of the Ba Tous, summarize the facts of the Ba Tous' oppression and exploitation of workers, and educate the workers. Typical grievance meetings should be used to promote the overall situation. At the same time, a large number of new cadres must be cultivated to serve as the backbone of the anti-Ba Tou movement and to replace the leading positions occupied by the Ba Tous. The North China mines mostly use training classes to cultivate new cadres. Secondly, organizations should be rectified, and democratic management institutions should be improved to remove Ba Tou elements who have infiltrated various institutions; workers with prestige among the masses should be promoted to leadership positions through democratic means. The reorganized workers' representative meeting and factory management committee can not only play a major role in the anti-Ba Tou movement, but also lay a good foundation for the future democratic management of the mine.

III. The purpose of abolishing the Ba Tou system is to liberate the productive forces of employees and develop mine production. Therefore, the anti-Ba Tou movement must be closely integrated with production. In the movement, it must be ensured that the production organization is not disrupted and that production is not reduced. To achieve this goal, leading cadres must, on the one hand, stop the go-slow and sabotage behaviors of the Ba Tou elements and make them honestly await disposal; at the same time, the labor organization should be rectified, labor discipline should be strengthened; a new and old team leader handover and a level-by-level responsibility system should be established. It is necessary to be good at encouraging and using activists to take the lead to educate and influence other workers. Otherwise, confusion will inevitably occur or be prolonged.

IV. Implementing the mass line is the key to determining the success or failure of the movement. The Yangquan Yugong Mine applied the mass line well in the anti-Ba Tou struggle. In the stage of ideological preparation, the mine's cadres were able to go deep into the groups to stimulate the emotions of the workers with vivid facts and guide the masses to speak out universally and boldly. At the same time, attention was paid to solving the urgent problems raised by the workers to stabilize and increase the workers' confidence. In dealing with the Ba Tous, the opinions of the workers should be listened to first, and the disposal opinions put forward by each group should be synthesized, and then submitted to the employee representative meeting for discussion. Leading cadres should express their agreement with the correct opinions put forward by each group; incorrect opinions should also be criticized through activists who can grasp the policies and guidelines, and the leaders should give explanations. In short, the anti-Ba Tou movement is a mass democratic reform movement, which must come from the masses and go to the masses, widely absorb the opinions of the masses, and give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, in order to ensure the complete victory of the movement.

### 华北国营煤矿反把头运动经验

　　华北国营煤矿反把头运动经验
    中国煤矿工会华北筹委会
    华北各国营煤矿的废除把头制运动，于四月份相继展开。现阳泉矿的反把头运动已经结束；焦作矿亦将结束；有些单位正在继续进行。综合各矿废除把头制运动的经验，共有如下几点。
    一、统一领导思想，明确方针政策，是开展反把头运动的基本环节。在过去，有许多矿山的负责人，在相当长的时期内，将把头当成技术人员，认为没有他们，就不能生产。有些矿山的负责人，认为既然反过恶霸，反过贪污，又改革了劳动组织，把头制度已经不存在了，这是把头残余能够长期存在的主要原因。因此，为了彻底废除把头制，必须首先澄清并统一领导干部的思想。并明确宣布废除把头制的政策和方针，使工人免去怀疑，敢于大胆行动。应该充分发动工人阶级，依靠工人阶级的自觉，坚决彻底废除把头制，建立小组负责制；同时，健全管委会和工代会，密切厂方与工人的联系，以便做到管理民主化及经营企业化。在执行政策上，要慎重认真，对把头应分别对待，贯彻改造和教育的方针。运动应由工会公开领导。一切问题应该通过行政、党、工会和团的小组与职工代表会的讨论，然后由行政下命令执行。这样才能使运动有计划有步骤地稳步前进。
    二、充分而周密的准备工作，是开展反把头运动的先决条件。反把头运动是群众性的民主改革运动，必须把群众真正发动起来，才能保证运动的成功。首先，应该进行深入的宣传动员，利用黑板报、宣传队、小型工人座谈会、访问老工人家庭等方式，揭露把头的罪恶，总结把头压迫和剥削工人的事实，向工人进行启发教育。并用典型的诉苦会，来推动全局。同时，必须培养大量新干部，做为反把头运动的骨干，并可代替被把头所占据的领导岗位。华北各矿多用开办训练班的办法来培养新干部。其次，应该整顿组织，健全民主管理机构，把潜入各种机构中的把头分子清洗出去；把群众中有威信的工人，经过民主方式，提拔到领导岗位上来。改组以后的工人代表会和工厂管理委员会，不仅在反把头运动中能发挥很大作用，而且给未来矿山的民主管理打下很好的基础。
    三、废除把头制度的目的，是解放职工的生产力，发展矿山生产，因此，废除把头制运动必须与生产紧密结合。在运动中，必须保证不使生产组织混乱，不使生产降低。为达到这一目的，领导干部一面要制止把头分子的怠工破坏的行为，使他们老老实实听候处理；同时，应整顿劳动组织，加强劳动纪律；建立新旧小组长交替和各级负责制，要善于鼓动用积极分子起带头作用，以教育和影响其他工人群众。否则，势必发生或延长混乱现象。
    四、贯彻群众路线，是决定运动成败的关键。阳泉裕公矿在反把头制斗争中，对群众路线运用的较好。在思想酝酿阶段，该矿干部能深入小组，以生动事实刺激工人情绪，引导群众普遍而大胆地发言。同时并注意解决工人所提出的迫切问题，以稳定并提高工人的信心。对把头的处理，则首先要倾听工人群众的意见，综合各小组所提出的处理意见后，再交职工代表会讨论。对各组所提出的正确意见，领导干部要表示同意；对不正确的意见，也要通过能掌握方针政策的积极分子加以批判，领导则给以解释。总之，反把头运动是群众性的民主改革运动，必须从群众中来，到群众中去，广泛吸收群众意见，发挥群众积极性，才能保证运动的彻底胜利。
