　　Nanyuan State-Run Demao Farm
    Uses Combine Harvesters for Wheat
    Corn is Also Planted by Machine
    [This newspaper reported] Nanyuan State-Run Demao Farm recently had the mechanized farming team from the Beijing Suburban Farm Administration bring in new combine harvesters from the Soviet Union, as well as five-bottom plows powered by 45-horsepower engines, to begin harvesting wheat, plowing land, and planting corn. This 60-horsepower harvester, if running at full capacity, can harvest fifteen mu per hour. Currently, because the machines are new and the workers want to take care of them, they are harvesting twelve mu of wheat per hour. Working ten hours a day, this is equivalent to the amount of wheat eighty people can harvest with sickles in a day. Since the farm began harvesting, nearby farmers and organizations have been visiting in an endless stream to observe.
    Demao Farm has planted a total of 590 mu of wheat, and they plan to complete the harvest within a week. They also plan to plow all 590 mu of wheat fields and plant corn in about ten days. (Pei Lan)

　　南苑国营德茂农场
    用联合机收麦
    种玉茭也用机器
    【本报讯】南苑国营德茂农场近日由京郊农场管理局机耕队开来新从苏联运来的联合收割机及四十五匹马力带动的五骅犁等，开始收麦、耕地、种玉茭。这部六十匹马力的收割机，如果开足了马力，每小时可以收割十五亩。现在因为机器是新的，工人们为了爱护机器，每小时收割小麦十二亩，每天工作十小时，可顶八十个人工，用镰刀收割一天的数量。该场开始收割后，附近农民及机关、团体前往参观者络绎不绝。
    德茂农场共种五九○亩小麦，他们准备在一礼拜内收割完毕。并在十天左右将五九○亩麦田全部耕完，种上玉茭。（培兰）
