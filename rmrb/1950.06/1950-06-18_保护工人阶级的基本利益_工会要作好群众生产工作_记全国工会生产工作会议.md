　　Protecting the Basic Interests of the Working Class
    Trade Unions Must Do a Good Job in Mass Production Work
    ——On the National Trade Union Production Work Conference
    Lei Xijia
    After the first Labor Day in New China, just as the organized working class across the country was universally launching a production competition, the National Trade Union Production Work Conference was held in Beijing from May 22nd to June 7th. This conference was convened after the basic organization of workers in all major industries and major cities. The conference discussed and studied the specific methods for trade union organizations to lead mass production work and made preliminary decisions. At the same time, it reviewed the existing achievements of trade union organizations in various major industries and regions in leading mass production work, and examined the existing biases.

    Trade Union Organizations in Both Public and Private Enterprises Should Focus on Production
    The first problem that must be solved here is: Why should leading mass production work be the central task of trade union organizations? Although trade union organizations in various industries and regions have an understanding of this issue, in practice, they often focus on day-to-day welfare work and place leading mass production work in a secondary position. Some individual trade union organizations even oppose welfare work to the development of production, neglecting that trade unions are mass organizations of the working class, and only by leading the masses to do a good job in production can they protect the basic interests of the working class. During this conference, Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a detailed report on the above issues, greatly enlightening the representatives. The work reports of various industries and provincial and municipal trade union organizations in the Northeast also showed that the reason why the lives of workers in the Northeast can be properly improved is mainly due to the development of production; because workers have played their due role in the development of production under the correct leadership of trade union organizations. This practical example made the ideological understanding of the representatives attending the meeting more clear.

    In private enterprises, trade union organizations should also focus on leading workers to do a good job in production. The labor-management consultation meetings that are currently being widely established in various places should not only discuss and solve some temporary difficult problems, but also discuss production as a regular central content. In private enterprises, the signing of collective contracts and temporary agreements should not only guarantee the establishment of normal labor-management relations, but also include the study of production plans and management. Only in this way can the production work of both public and private enterprises be done well at the same time, achieving the goal of mutual benefit for labor and management and the development of production.

    Experiences in various places have proved that wherever trade union organizations can do a good job in mass production work, the trade union organization can be consolidated; the development of production is clear and consistent, and the relationship between the Party and the trade union can be well coordinated.

    Organizing Production Competitions is the Basic Method for Promoting Mass Production Work
    How do trade union organizations lead mass production work? The conclusion of this conference is that organizing production competitions is the basic method for promoting mass production work. Production competition is a concrete manifestation of the new labor attitude of the working masses. In launching production competitions, productivity can be gradually improved, rationalization proposals can be promoted; and through the mutual supervision and encouragement of the working masses, new labor discipline can be consciously established and implemented; advanced production workers can also help or influence workers with poor skills and awareness in terms of operation methods and labor attitudes, improve production levels, and strengthen worker unity; it can also closely coordinate the production work of various departments and promote the signing of linkage contracts; competitions can also be used to explore preliminary quotas and create preconditions for the signing of collective contracts. Only in this way can the content of production meetings at all levels be enriched, and can democratization of management be implemented in depth. The New Record Movement in the Northeast is actually a production competition movement. According to the facts in the Northeast, it can also be explained that production competition is the basic method for promoting all mass production work.

    The main method for trade union organizations to conduct production competitions is to help workers formulate production plans and competition treaties. This gives the competition a certain goal, and the trade union can check the implementation of the plan, discover good models and promote them, and help those who are lagging behind to progress. According to the existing experience in the Northeast and North China regions, production competitions can be organized wherever production is relatively normal, grassroots organizations have been established, and the new labor attitude of workers has begun to be established. There can be different competition contents under different circumstances. Dalian and Lushun have cost reduction competitions; Tianjin Zhongfang Factory transformed old enterprises through competitions.

    At the same time, production competition should become a regular way of labor and life for the working masses, rather than a surprise attack. At present, some areas regard organizing production competitions as a surprise attack, which often ends after a period of intense activity. For example, Shijiazhuang has conducted three competitions since 1948, and some areas have only had one Red May. In the competition, various places often simply strengthen the intensity of labor. For example, when the Tianjin Tram Company launched a production competition, more than 20 of the 120 workers became ill from fatigue. Or they only focus on increasing quantity, while ignoring the quality and the limits of machine efficiency. The Zhangjiakou Oil Extraction Factory damaged the machines because of the competition. There is also a phenomenon of blind competition: the products of the Xi'an Match Factory have no sales, and they still want to launch a competition to increase quantity. The leadership of the competition in various places is also not unified. The above reasons have caused a wave-like development of production work in some areas. For this reason, the National Trade Union Production Conference affirmed that production competitions should be organized and led by trade unions.

    In addition, some areas have not yet properly resolved the issue of rewards, which has also affected the development of the competition. Generally, there is an emphasis on spiritual rewards, winning red flags, and issuing medals, and the material rewards are not commensurate with the wealth created by the workers. Liaodong Ceramics Company reduced costs by 400 million, and only rewarded workers with 45,000 yuan (Northeast currency), and sometimes only gave a bar of soap or a towel. And the awards are not given in time. The prize for March in a public cotton mill in Tianjin has not been issued yet. The director of the trade union had no choice but to get a red piece of paper to congratulate the workers. Some factories violate the principle of payment according to work and adopt collective rewards. The conference decided that the principle of rewards should be: "Combining the workers' enthusiasm with their stake in the results of their labor."

    Grassroots Trade Unions are the Focus of Leading Mass Production Work
    According to the existing experience of trade union organizations in various industries and regions, grassroots trade unions are the focus of leading mass production work. The focus of grassroots trade unions leading mass production work is on trade union groups (which should be consistent with production groups). Because trade union groups are in direct contact with the masses, only when trade union groups are sound can every worker be motivated to actively participate in production work. The achievements of Ma Hengyi's team in the Shenyang Machinery Factory and the promotion of its experience illustrate the important role of trade union groups in mass production work.

    This conference systematically summarized the experience of trade union organizations in various industries and regions in leading mass production work, clarified the main problems in the work, and decided on some specific methods. According to the unanimous reflection of trade union and administrative cadres and worker representatives attending the meeting, this conference will have a certain role in promoting mass production work nationwide.

### 保护工人阶级的基本利益  工会要作好群众生产工作——记全国工会生产工作会议

　　保护工人阶级的基本利益
    工会要作好群众生产工作
    ——记全国工会生产工作会议
    雷希嘉
    在新中国第一个劳动节后，正当全国有组织的工人阶级普遍开展生产竞赛的时候，全国工会生产工作会议于五月二十二日到六月七日在北京举行了。这个会议是在全国各主要产业的，各大中城市的工人基本上组织起来的情况下召开的。会议讨论和研究了工会组织领导群众生产工作的具体作法，并作出了初步的决定。同时又检阅了各主要产业，各地区工会组织，在领导群众生产工作方面已有的成绩，和检查了现存的偏向。
    公、私营企业中的工会组织都应以搞好生产为中心任务
    这里首先必须解决的问题是：为什么要以领导群众生产工作作为工会组织的中心任务。各产业及各地区工会组织对于这个问题，虽然是有认识的，但在实际工作中，常常偏重于搞日常福利工作，而把领导群众生产工作放在了次要的地位。个别工会组织甚至于把搞福利与发展生产对立起来。忽略了工会是工人阶级的群众组织，只有领导群众搞好生产，才算是保护了工人阶级的基本利益。在这次会议期间，中华全国总工会李立三副主席，曾就以上问题作了详尽的报告，给与会代表以很大的启示。东北地区各产业及各省、市工会组织的工作报告，同时也说明了目前东北工人生活所以能得到适当的改善，主要是由于生产的发展；由于工人在发展生产中，因为工会组织的正确领导，起了应起的作用。这个实际的例证，使出席会议的代表的思想认识愈加明确。
    在私营企业中，工会组织也同样应以领导工人群众搞好生产为中心任务。目前各地正在普遍建立的劳资协商会议，不仅要讨论并解决一些暂时的困难问题，并且应以讨论生产作为经常的中心内容。在私营企业中，订立集体合同和临时协议，除保证了建立正常的劳资关系外，也应包括研究生产计划和管理。这样才能使公私营企业的生产工作同时作好，达到劳资两利、发展生产的目的。
    各地经验证明：凡是工会组织能够作好群众生产工作，工会组织就能巩固；发展生产的方针明确一致，政、工关系就能很好配合。
    组织生产竞赛是推进群众生产工作的基本方法
    工会组织怎样领导群众生产工作呢？这次会议的结论是：组织生产竞赛，乃是推动群众生产工作的基本方法。生产竞赛是工人群众新的劳动态度的具体表现。在展开生产竞赛中，可以逐渐提高生产率，可以推动合理化建议；又可以通过工人群众的互相监督和鼓励，自觉的建立并推行新的劳动纪律；也可以使先进的生产工作者在操作法和劳动态度方面帮助或影响技术和觉悟差的工人，提高生产水平，加强工人团结，也可以密切各部门生产工作的配合，推动连系合同的订立；还可以经过竞赛，摸索出初步定额，为订立集体合同创造先决条件。只有这样，才能充实各级生产会议的内容，并可深入的实行管理民主化。东北的新纪录运动，实际是生产竞赛运动。根据东北的事实，也可以说明生产竞赛是推动一切群众生产工作的基本方法。
    工会组织生产竞赛的主要方法，是帮助工人订生产计划及竞赛条约。这样使竞赛有了一定的目标，工会才可以检查计划的执行，发现好的典型予以推广，对于落后的则帮助他们进步。根据东北和华北地区现有的经验：凡是生产比较正常，基层组织已经建立起来，而工人新的劳动态度已经开始树立，就可以组织生产竞赛。在不同的情况下可以有不同的竞赛内容。旅大有降低成本的竞赛；天津中纺工厂通过竞赛改造了旧企业。
    同时，生产竞赛应成为工人群众经常的劳动和生活方式，而不是突击运动。目前一些地区把组织生产竞赛当作突击运动，常常是轰轰烈烈一阵子就完了。如石家庄从一九四八年以来搞了三次竞赛，有的地区是红五月一次。各地在竞赛中，常常是单纯的加强劳动强度。如天津电车公司展开生产竞赛时，一百二十个工人中有二十多人累病了。或者只顾数量的提高，而忽略了质量及机器效能的限度。张家口榨油厂就是因为搞竞赛，把机器都弄坏了。至于盲目的竞赛现象也是存在的：西安火柴厂产品没有销路，还要展开提高数量的竞赛。各地对竞赛的领导也不统一。以上各种原因，造成了某些地区生产工作上波浪式进行的现象。为此，全国工会生产会议上肯定：生产竞赛应由工会组织和领导。
    此外，有些地区对奖励问题还没有适当解决，也影响了竞赛的发展。一般是偏重精神奖励，夺红旗，发奖章，在物质奖励方面与工人所创造的财富不相当。辽东陶瓷公司成本降低四亿，才奖励工人四万五千元（东北币），有时只发一块肥皂或一条手巾。而且发奖不及时。天津一个公营纱厂三月份的奖，到现在还没有发，工会主任没办法，弄了一张红纸条去给工人道喜。有的工厂则是违反按劳付酬的原则，采取集体奖励。会议决定奖励的原则应当是：“把工人的热忱与他们对自己劳动结果的利害关系结合起来。”
    基层工会是领导群众生产工作的重心
    根据各产业、各地区工会组织现有的经验，基层工会是领导群众生产工作的重心。而基层工会领导群众生产工作的重心是在工会小组（应与生产小组是一致的）。由于工会小组是直接联系群众的，只有工会小组健全，才可以推动每一个工人积极参加生产工作。沈阳机械厂马恒易小组的成就，及其经验的推广，正说明了工会小组在群众生产工作中的重要作用。
    这次会议由于系统地总结了各产业、各地区工会组织领导群众生产工作的经验，明确了进行工作中的主要问题，并决定了一些具体作法。据参加会议的工会和行政干部以及工人代表一致的反映：这次会议对全国范围内的群众生产工作，将发生一定的推动作用。
