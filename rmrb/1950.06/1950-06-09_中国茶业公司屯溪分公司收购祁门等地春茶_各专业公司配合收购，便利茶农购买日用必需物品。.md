　　【Wuhu News】 *Wan Nan Daily* reports: In the large-scale spring tea purchase by the China Tea Company Tunxi Branch, Party and government leading organs and economic departments in various places have closely cooperated, enabling the purchase work to proceed smoothly. State-owned specialized companies stationed in various tea-producing areas, as well as local cooperatives, have cooperated in the tea purchase work with a large amount of manpower and materials. In addition to setting up distribution points at appropriate locations, the leadership also organizes legitimate private merchants to entrust them with the sale of goods, making it convenient for tea farmers to purchase. For example, grain, department store, and salt companies and cooperatives stationed in Qimen County have established a total of 40 distribution points and entrusted sales outlets. From April 24, when tea went on the market, to May 23, Qimen area sold more than 1.86 million jin of rice, 500,000 jin of salt, and more than 3,300 bolts of various cloths. Therefore, after selling tea, tea farmers do not have to spend time buying up physical goods, and can bring the RMB home to rush to the mountains to pick tea or make tea, and only go to the market to buy necessities when they have time to spare. Tea farmers said: "Prices are stable, there is rice when we want rice, we can buy whatever we want, Chairman Mao really has a way!"
    However, some shortcomings and mistakes have also occurred in the purchase work in the past month. For example, in the tea areas of Dingxiangshu, Qili, and Pailou in Guichi County, due to inconvenient transportation and untimely supply of materials, coupled with the lack of experience in the county's leadership, and the failure of cooperatives and trade departments to actively organize forces to cooperate in the tea areas, local prices once fluctuated. Because it was too expensive to buy rice in this area, tea farmers traveled hundreds of miles to Qimen to sell tea. Because of the long distance and the delay of two days in selling, some tea leaves became moldy. In addition, the establishment of purchasing stations in some remote mountainous areas is not widespread enough. Therefore, some tea farmers need to spend a day selling a dan of tea. The above shortcomings should be taken as a lesson by various places, and attention should be paid to them in the continued purchase.
    【Another News】 In order to support and develop tea production, the Tunxi Branch of China Tea Company issued a huge amount of tea loans last winter and this spring. Tea farmers have increased their profits this spring and their enthusiasm for production is high. They have actively repaid their tea loans.
    The company lent more than 2.47 million jin of rice in Qimen County alone. With loans, tea farmers have improved their enthusiasm for production and have generally cultivated tea trees, which has greatly increased tea production this year compared with the past.
    This year, when black tea went on the market, the Tunxi Branch specially set up stations in various tea-producing areas to purchase tea, saving tea farmers’ labor and round-trip expenses. In terms of mastering tea prices, according to the production costs of tea farmers, according to the principle of "good goods and high prices", the various exploitations imposed on tea farmers by the collusion between bureaucratic capital and unscrupulous merchants during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang were forever eliminated. With the increase in production and stable prices, tea farmers have obtained production profits that they have not had in many years. For example, including the summer tea income, each of the county's 70,000 people in Qimen County is expected to receive an average of nearly two shi of rice, which can solve the problem of living for four months. Taking Sanfang Village in Qimen as an example: this year's spring tea harvest was 270 dan. After repaying the tea loan, there are still more than 170 dan. Selling tea can buy 510 shi of rice, with an average of 205 jin of rice per person.
    At present, tea farmers are full of confidence in restoring and developing tea production, and are preparing to continue to expand production. At the same time, they are actively repaying tea loans. For example, as of May 20, according to actual warehouse entry figures in Qimen County, tea farmers have returned 2.22 million jin of rice, accounting for more than 89% of the total tea loans.

　　中国茶业公司屯溪分公司收购祁门等地春茶
    各专业公司配合收购，便利茶农购买日用必需物品。
    【芜湖讯】皖南日报消息：在中国茶业公司屯溪分公司春季大量收购红茶中，各地党、政领导机关和经济部门均密切配合，使收购工作得以顺利进行。驻各产茶区的国营各专业公司，以及各地合作社，均以大量的人力物力来配合收茶工作。除在各适当地址设立分销处外，还有领导地组织正当私商，委托代售物品，便利茶农购买。如驻祁门县的粮食、百货、盐业等专业公司及合作社，即建立分销处和委托代销店共达四十处。自四月二十四日茶叶上市至五月二十三日这一时期中，祁门地区售出大米一百八十六万多斤，食盐五十万零数千斤，各种布三千三百多匹。茶农因此在卖茶之后，用不着再耗费时间，购存实物，即可带上人民币赶回家去，赶忙上山采茶或是制茶，当采制有闲时，才去市场购买必需物品。茶农们说：“物价稳定了，要米有米，买什么有什么，毛主席真是有办法！”
    但月来收购工作中也发生过某些缺点和错误。如贵池县丁香树、七里、牌楼等茶区，由于交通不便物资供应不及时，加上该县领导上经验不足，合作社和贸易部门又未能积极组织力量到茶区配合，致当地物价一度呈现波动，该地茶农因在本区买米太贵，即往返百数十里到祁门境内卖茶。由于路远再在出售时过两天，有的茶叶便霉烂了。另外是有的偏远山区，收购站设立的还不够广。故有的茶农卖一担茶需花费一天时间。以上缺点各地应引为教训，在继续收购中加以注意。
    【又讯】中国茶业公司屯溪分公司，为扶植与发展茶叶生产，去冬今春曾发放巨额茶贷，今春茶农获利增多，生产情绪高涨，已踊跃归还茶贷。
    该公司仅在祁门一县，即贷出大米二百四十七万余斤。茶农获得贷款，生产积极性提高，曾普遍培植茶棵，使今年茶叶产量较过去大为增加。
    今年红茶上市，屯溪分公司特在各产茶区广泛设站收购，节省了茶农的劳力和往返花费。在茶价的掌握上，根据茶农的生产成本，按着“货好价高”的原则，使过去国民党反动统治时期官僚资本和奸商相互勾结，加于茶农的种种剥削，永远解除。加上产量增加，物价稳定，茶农便得到数年来从未有过的生产利润。如祁门县连夏茶收入预计在内，全县七万多人口，每人平均可得约近二石米的收获，可解决四个月的生活。以祁门三方村为例：今年春茶收获二百七十担，偿还茶贷之后，还有一百七十余担，卖了茶可买米五百一十石，平均每人可得大米二百零五斤。
    目前茶农对恢复与发展茶叶生产充满信心，准备继续扩大生产，同时已在踊跃归还茶贷。如祁门县截至五月二十日止，据实际入库数字，茶农已经交还了二百二十万零数百斤的大米，占全部茶贷的百分之八十九强。
