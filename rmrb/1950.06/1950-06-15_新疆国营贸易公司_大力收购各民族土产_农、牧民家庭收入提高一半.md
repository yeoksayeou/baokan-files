    农、牧民家庭收入提高一半
    【新华社迪化十三日电】新疆各地国营贸易分、支公司大量收购各民族人民的土产。迪化、焉耆、伊犁、塔城等四处贸易公司截至目前已购到驼、羊等兽毛一千吨，羔皮八万二千张，粗皮十七万张、细皮二万三千五百张，羊七万六千只，羊肠十二万根，牛八千五百头，使各族农、牧民的家庭经济收入较过去提高百分之五十以上。各族农、牧民对于人民政府这一正确的贸易政策，莫不一致称颂。
    按新疆省自解放以来，在省贸易总公司统一领导下，曾先后在喀什、阿克苏、和阗、焉耆、伊犁、塔城、阿山、霍尔果斯、哈密等地建立了贸易公司的分支机构，并在各地开设了若干门市部和土产庄。未建立公司的地区现正积极筹办中。
