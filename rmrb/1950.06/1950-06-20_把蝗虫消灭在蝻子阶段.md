　　Eliminate Locusts in the Nymph Stage
　　Wu Hongji
　　Beginning in February this year, locust nymphs have been continuously discovered in many regions. As of early June, locusts are still continuing to develop. Not only are there local locusts (grasshoppers), but also large numbers of migratory locusts. In Hebei Province, locust nymphs have appeared in 29 counties including Linyu, Ningjin, Cangxian, Lingshou, Huolu, Handan, Julu, Dacheng, Yuanshi, Daming, Shahe, Quzhou, Zhao County, Cixian, Xingtang, Quyang, Jingxian, Wucheng, Qingxian, Lincheng, etc. Last year in Pingyuan Province, local locusts devoured many green seedlings. This spring, local locusts continue to cause damage in seven counties: Anyang, Lin County, Tangyin, Qi County, Hui County, Xiuwu, and Neihuang. In Shandong, local locusts have infested 22 counties, including Baiyan, Yi County, Rushan, Haiyang, Muping, Wulian, Huimin, Shanghe, Linyi, Wuqiao, Pingyuan, Jiyang, De County, Dongguang, Deping, and Yanshan. In Dezhou Prefecture alone, the affected area in 15 counties has reached over 87,000 mu, with a small portion being migratory locusts. In northern Anhui's Xuyi and Sihong counties, over 24,000 mu have been infested with migratory locusts. In northern Jiangsu's Yizheng and Liuhe counties, and Henan Province's Xihua, Song County, Yiyang, and Yichuan counties, locusts have appeared. In Xihua, the area infested with migratory locusts once expanded to over 19,500 mu. It has been basically eradicated through manual capture. In Xinjiang Province, a major locust plague occurred last year. Since May this year, migratory locusts have infested over 170,000 mu of fields in Jinghua, Suilai, Shawan, Jinghe, and Turpan counties.
　　Because locusts have occurred in various localities over the years, leaders at all levels, as well as the masses and cadres, in the long struggle against locusts, have not only recognized the severity of the locust damage but have also accumulated very rich locust control experience. In Hebei and Pingyuan provinces, although locust nymphs have continuously appeared this year, they are generally eliminated as soon as they are found. For example, in Anyang, Tangyin, Lin County, Xiuwu and other counties in Pingyuan Province, by the time the provincial level received reports of the locust situation, the locusts had already been eliminated by the masses. In Dacheng County, Hebei Province, in eleven days, methods such as digging ditches and surrounding the locusts were used to eliminate various nymph groups within eighty square li. Daming County, combined with disaster relief work, organized the masses and livestock to completely till the migratory locust breeding areas in the Zhang River flooded area, preventing the occurrence of locusts. In addition, after the locusts first appeared in Xinjiang Province, the Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture led technical cadres, carrying a large number of medicines and equipment, to the locust-affected areas for prevention and control, and local troops participated in the fight against locusts, eradicating 55,500 mu of locusts in about ten days. This year, in the locust eradication work, except for some areas where it was not well combined with the summer harvest work, and after the locust nymphs were discovered, the leading organs were not promptly reported, and the masses were not actively organized to eliminate them, the actions were generally taken very early, so that the seedlings avoided losses.
　　However, we cannot be satisfied with these current achievements. According to the law of locust occurrence, spring is only the beginning of locust occurrence, and a large number of locust nymphs will continue to occur afterwards. Therefore, I would like to put forward the following points, hoping that the leading organs in various places will pay close attention:
　　(1) In areas where locusts frequently occur, inspections must be carried out at any time. It is necessary to immediately mobilize and organize the masses, promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, regardless of day and night, regardless of region, regardless of public or private land, using burning, killing, beating, and other effective scientific methods, to treat early, treat quickly, and strive to eliminate them on the spot in the nymph stage, so as not to spread into locusts.
　　(2) This year, the locusts occur mostly in grasslands, cemeteries, slopes, reed ponds, and general wasteland. Therefore, locust eradication and wasteland reclamation should be combined. Only in this way can the locusts' place of origin be completely eliminated.
　　(3) There are quite a lot of local locusts this year. We cannot only think that eradicating migratory locusts is important and ignore the timely eradication of local locusts. In fact, last year in Pingyuan, Hebei and other places, local locusts formed a serious disaster. Therefore, regardless of local or migratory locusts, they must be given equal importance and eliminated at the same time.

### 把蝗虫消灭在蝻子阶段

　　把蝗虫消灭在蝻子阶段
    吴宏吉
    今年从二月开始，不少地区，即连续发现蝗蝻。到六月初旬，蝗虫仍在继续发展。不仅有土蝗（土蚂蚱），而且已有大批的飞蝗。河北省有临榆、宁晋、沧县、灵寿、获鹿、邯郸、巨鹿、大城、元氏、大名、沙河、曲周、赵县、磁县、行唐、曲阳、景县、武城、青县、临城等二十九县发生蝗蝻。平原省去年土蝗吃光了很多青苗，今年春季在安阳、林县、汤阴、淇县、辉县、修武、内黄等七县，仍有土蝗为害。在山东有白彦、峄县、乳山、海阳、牟平、五莲、惠民、商河、临邑、吴桥、平原、济阳、德县、东光、德平、盐山等二十二县，发生土蝗。仅德县专区十五个县中，发生面积即达八万七千余亩，并有一小部分是飞蝗。在皖北盱眙、泗洪二县发生了飞蝗的有二万四千余亩。在苏北的仪征、六合两县，及河南省的西华、嵩县、宜阳、伊川等四县，均有蝗虫发生。西华发生飞蝗的面积曾发展到一万九千五百余亩。经用人工捕打，已基本扑灭。在新疆省去年曾发生过大蝗灾。今年五月以来，在景化、绥来、沙湾、精河、吐鲁蕃等五县，有十七万余亩田发生了飞蝗。
    因为蝗虫在各地历年发生，各地领导上以及群众和干部在长时期的捕蝗斗争中，不仅认识了蝗虫为害的严重性，而且也积累了很丰富的治蝗经验。在河北、平原两省，今年虽然不断有蝗蝻出现，一般随时加以消灭。如平原省安阳、汤阴、林县、修武等县，等到省级得到了蝗情，已是蝗虫被群众消灭了的时候。河北省大城县十一天的时间，用掘沟围打等办法，消灭了八十方里内的各个蝻群。大名县结合了救灾工作，组织群众和畜力，将漳河泛区内飞蝗产卵地区全部耕完，阻止了蝗虫的发生。另外，在新疆省蝗虫刚发生后，省农业厅副厅长率领了技术干部携带大量药械赶往蝗区防治，并有当地部队参加打蝗，在十天左右，即扑灭了五万五千五百亩蝗虫。今年在灭蝗工作中，除部分地区，因未与夏收工作结合好，蝗蝻发现以后，没有及时报告领导机关，积极组织群众扑灭外一般动手都很早，使青苗避免了损失。
    但是我们不能满足于目前的这些成绩。根据蝗虫的发生规律，春季仅是蝗虫发生的开始，嗣后更会陆续发生大批蝗蝻。故特提出以下几点，希望各地领导机关，严切注意：
    （一）在蝗虫常发生地区，必须随时进行检查，要立刻动员组织群众，发扬群众的积极性创造性，不分昼夜，不分地区，不分公地私地，用烧、杀、打及其他有效科学方法，早治，快治，务求在蝻子阶段，就地消灭，不使蔓延成蝗。
    （二）今年春季蝗虫发生地点，仍多在草滩、坟地、坡地、苇塘及一般荒地。因此，灭蝗与灭荒，应该结合进行。只有这样，才能彻底消灭蝗虫的原产地。
    （三）今年的土蝗发生相当多，不能只认为扑灭飞蝗重要，而忽视随时扑灭土蝗。事实上，在去年平原、河北等地，土蝗曾形成严重的灾害。因此，不论土蝗飞蝗，必须同时并重，一概扑灭。
