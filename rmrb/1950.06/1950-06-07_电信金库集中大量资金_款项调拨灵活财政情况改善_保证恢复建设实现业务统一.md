　　Telecom Treasury Centralizes Large Amounts of Funds
    Flexible Allocation of Funds; Improved Financial Situation
    Guaranteeing Restoration and Construction; Achieving Business Unification

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 30th] Since the establishment of the Telecom Treasury at the end of March, it has achieved preliminary results in centralizing funds, flexible allocation, and realizing unified business plans.

　　Telecom enterprises originally inherited a dilapidated mess from the Kuomintang reactionary government, and their finances were extremely difficult. Although income had been reorganized and expenditures reduced, due to the lack of organizational unity and the dispersal of funds across various regions, even sums of three to five hundred million were felt to be difficult to circulate, making it difficult to smoothly carry out supplementary equipment, key restoration, and construction work. The establishment of the Treasury has first improved this past financial situation. As of the 20th of this month, the central treasury has concentrated 36 billion yuan and can regularly control more than 30 billion yuan in cash for centralized use. The Central China Administration of the enterprise originally had extremely tight finances. When issuing year-end bonuses this spring, it requested the General Bureau to allocate 4.2 billion yuan, but after the establishment of the Treasury, the region's financial revenue and expenditure have reached a balance.

　　Secondly, the enterprise has greatly facilitated the unified use of funds due to the centralization of funds. The enterprise has now allocated 23.2 billion yuan from the treasury as expenses for purchasing maintenance equipment (used for maintaining lines and repairing machines). Originally, the funds for purchasing maintenance equipment needed to temporarily misappropriate other expenses or delay payment. Before the establishment of the Treasury, the Central China Administration of the enterprise requested the General Bureau to allocate 800 million yuan in aid to the Hankou Battery Factory under its leadership. The General Bureau tried to allocate 200 million; after the establishment of the Treasury, the remaining 600 million yuan to be continuously allocated was drawn from the funds turned over by Central China, without the need for separate fundraising. Therefore, the Treasury has not only guaranteed the smooth progress of the enterprise's restoration work, but also ensured that the enterprise's other construction expenses would no longer be misappropriated. Of the 340 million kilograms of millet in the enterprise's 1950 new construction project plan, 180 million kilograms of millet needed to be transferred from the business income project. This huge financial plan has also had a reliable guarantee since the establishment of the Treasury and the centralization of funds.

　　Before the enterprise established the Treasury, the profits and losses of various regions could not be mutually adjusted. The profitable regions deposited the surplus funds into local banks, while the loss-making regions, such as Guizhou and western Hubei, had not yet paid the salaries for January in March. After the establishment of the Treasury, the central treasury can make appropriate adjustments to profits and losses, and a portion of the treasury funds can be drawn out to subsidize the loss-making regions, so that the entire enterprise can proceed smoothly.

　　In addition, the establishment of the Treasury has improved the unsound budget system of various bureaus of the enterprise, promoted the organizational unity of the enterprise, and saved unnecessary expenses. In the past, individual bureaus had taken funds from business income without the approval of the general and branch bureaus, causing the phenomenon of spending first and reporting later or chaotic expenditures. After the implementation of the Treasury system, due to the regulations of "no budget, no allocation" and "no calculation, no approval of budget," the budgets of all bureaus are submitted to the General Bureau for review on schedule, thus enabling the enterprise to move more smoothly towards planned management and greatly strengthening unity. At the same time, due to the General Bureau's strict review of the budgets reported by various regions, unnecessary expenses have been reduced, such as a 7% reduction in Xi'an compared to the original budget.

　　Since its establishment, the General Treasury of the enterprise now has 30 branch treasuries, which have been generally established in major and medium-sized cities across the country. The enterprise is now preparing to establish sub-treasuries (third-level treasuries) to concentrate the telecommunications funds of small bureaus in various provinces, so that the enterprise's unified business plan can be more smoothly realized.

### 电信金库集中大量资金  款项调拨灵活财政情况改善  保证恢复建设实现业务统一

　　电信金库集中大量资金
    款项调拨灵活财政情况改善
    保证恢复建设实现业务统一
    【新华社三十日讯】电信金库自三月底建立以来，已在集中资金、灵活调拨和实现统一的业务计划等方面获得了初步成效。
    电信企业原是接收国民党反动政府遗留下的破烂摊子，财政极感困难。虽经整顿收入，缩减支出，但由于组织未经统一，资金分散各地，虽三五亿数目之款，亦深感周转不灵之苦，因而在补充器材、重点恢复和建设工作上均难顺利进行。金库建立后，首先改善了过去的这种财务情况。迄本月二十日止，总库已集中了资金三百六十亿，并能经常掌握现金三百余亿元，集中运用。该企业华中管理局原来财务至为拮据，今春发年终奖金时，曾要求总局拨发四十二亿元，但在建立金库后，全区财务收支上已达到平衡。
    其次，由于该企业集中了资金，对于统一运用资金大感便利。该企业现已由库款中拨出二百三十二亿元作为购买维护器材（用在维护线路和修整机器上）费用，原来购置维护器材的经费，是需要暂时挪用其他费用，或者拖延拨付时间的。该企业华中管理局于建库前曾要求总局拨给该局领导下之汉口电池工厂八亿元扶助费，总局曾设法拨给二亿；金库建立后，原要继续拨给之六亿即由华中缴库之款中抽拨，不需要再另外筹拨。因而金库对该企业既保证了恢复工作的顺利进行，又保证了该企业其他工程费用不致再被挪用。该企业一九五○年新建工程计划三亿四千余万斤小米中，有一亿八千余万斤小米须由营业收入项目中调出，此项巨大财政计划，亦自金库建立、资金得以集中后，才有了可靠的保证。
    该企业未建库前，各地盈亏不能互相调剂，盈的将剩余资金存入该地银行，而亏的如贵州、鄂西地区，三月份尚未发一月份的薪金；金库建立后，总库即可将盈亏加以适当调剂，对亏损地区可抽出一部库款予以贴补，使整个企业得以顺利地进行工作。
    此外，金库的建立，改进了该企业各个局不健全的预算制度，促进了该企业组织的统一性，并节约了不必要的开支。过去个别局曾有未经总分局批准即由营业收入中提用的事情，造成先支后报或支出紊乱的现象；实行金库制度后，由于有了“无预算不拨款”、“无计算不批预算”的规定，各局预算均按期送呈该总局审核，因而使该企业更顺利地走向计划管理，并大大加强了统一性。同时，又由于总局对各地所报预算的严格审核，削减了不必要的开支，如西安比原预算减少了百分之七。
    该企业总金库自建立后，迄今已有了三十处分库，全国各大、中城市均已普遍设立。该企业现正准备建立支库（第三级金库），将各省小局的电信资金亦予集中，以求该企业统一的业务计划能更顺利地实现。
