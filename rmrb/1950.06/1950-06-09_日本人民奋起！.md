    The Japanese People Rise Up!
    Following the illegal arrest by the American occupation authorities of eight participants in the Tokyo "May 30th People's Assembly," and the arbitrary sentencing of these innocent patriotic people to long terms of hard labor, MacArthur, the agent of American imperialism in Japan, on June 6th, arbitrarily issued an order to "purge" all 24 members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, remove them from their public posts, and prohibit them from participating in all political activities. Six JCP members elected by the Japanese people, including JCP General Secretary Tokuda Kyuichi and Politburo member Nosaka Sanzō, have therefore been deprived of the right to fight for the interests of the Japanese people in the parliament. The Yoshida reactionary government is drafting a fascist bill to declare the Communist Party illegal, according to the instructions of the dictator MacArthur. Steps for large-scale bloody suppression are being actively arranged. This is an open and shameless attack by the American and Japanese reactionaries on the Japanese people. They have completely disregarded the principles of democratization of Japan in the Potsdam Declaration, and completely disregarded the provisions concerning the basic rights of the people in their so-called new constitution. They have finally torn off the last layer of the mask of "American-style democracy"!
    Why are the American and Japanese reactionaries so impatient and brazenly taking these measures that are bound to cause serious consequences? The answer is: because the war policy of American imperialism to turn Japan into a military base, and the traitorous policy of the Yoshida puppet government to cater to MacArthur, are being increasingly and heavily resisted by the Japanese people's movement led by the Japanese Communist Party.
    American imperialism had long ago decided to implement the conspiracy of long-term occupation of Japan under the policy of "unproclaimed peace," and recently accelerated the steps to carry out this conspiracy. The American warmongers Dulles, Johnson, Bradley, and Radford, etc., who are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo one after another these days, will secretly discuss with MacArthur how to further concretize the plan to occupy Japan for a long time and turn Japan into a military base. All American and Japanese reactionary newspapers no longer conceal the fact that American imperialism is unwilling to conclude a peace treaty with Japan. MacArthur's toy, the Japanese traitor Yoshida, shamelessly uses "de facto peace" as a smokescreen to welcome the long-term occupation of the United States.
    These plans and conspiracies of the American and Japanese reactionaries violate the principles of the Potsdam Declaration, violate the agreement of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, and at the same time violate the interests and demands of the Japanese people. The Japanese people demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty and oppose any form of unilateral treaty; demand the early withdrawal of the occupying forces and oppose long-term occupation and militarization; demand the restoration and development of a peaceful economy and oppose turning Japan into an "arsenal of Asia"; demand democratization and oppose militarization. These slogans were put forward in the Tokyo May Day demonstration attended by 600,000 people, in the Tokyo "May 30th People's Assembly" attended by 100,000 people, in the national student protest movement against the Yells incident, and in the anti-layoff strike movement of workers at the Toho Film Production Studio and Hitachi Manufacturing. The Japanese people united around the Japanese Communist Party have taken these slogans as their specific goals for striving for peace, democracy, and independence. Therefore, these slogans have become the common action program of the Japanese democratic national front. This huge force of the Japanese people has erected an insurmountable obstacle on the road of the new war being prepared by the American and Japanese reactionaries to attack China, the Soviet Union, and the people of Asian countries. MacArthur and Yoshida's new atrocities are a reflection of the panic of the American and Japanese reactionaries.
    The high-pressure tactics of the American and Japanese reactionaries will never be able to subdue the Japanese people who have already risen up. The Japanese people are not isolated. Their just struggle—the struggle for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty and against long-term occupation, the struggle for independence and democracy and against enslavement and fascism—will be supported by the people of Asian countries, especially the Chinese people. Victory belongs to the people.

### 日本人民奋起！

    日本人民奋起！
    继美国占领当局非法逮捕东京《五·三○人民大会》的八名参加者，并专横地对这些无辜的爱国志士判处长期苦役以后，美帝国主义在日本的代理人——麦克阿瑟，又于六月六日擅自发出命令，要“整肃”日本共产党中央委员会全体委员二十四人，取消他们所担任的公职，禁止他们参加一切政治活动。为日本人民选举出来的日共议员六人，其中包括日共总书记德田球一和政治局委员野坂参三，已因此被剥夺了在议会中为日本人民的利益而斗争的权利。吉田反动政府正在按照着独裁者麦克阿瑟的指令，制订宣布共产党为非法的法西斯法案。大规模的血腥镇压的步骤，正在积极布置中。这是美日反动派对日本人民的公开而无耻的进攻。他们已经完全不顾波茨坦宣言中关于日本民主化的原则，完全不顾他们自己所拟定的所谓新宪法中关于人民基本权利的规定。他们终于撕下了最后一层“美国式民主”的假面具！
    美日反动派为什么迫不及待，悍然采取这些必然将引起严重后果的措施呢？答复是：因为美帝国主义变日本为军事基地的战争政策，吉田傀儡政府逢迎麦克阿瑟的卖国政策，正越来越沉重地遭受到由日本共产党所领导的日本人民运动的抗击。
    美帝国主义早已决定在“不宣而和”的方针下，实行长期占领日本的阴谋，最近则更加速了进行这一阴谋的步骤。定于日内先后抵达东京的美国战争贩子杜勒斯、詹逊、布莱德雷和雷德福等，将与麦克阿瑟密商如何使长期占领日本以及变日本为军事基地的计划进一步具体化。所有美日反动报纸，都不再讳饰美帝国主义不愿缔结对日和约这一事实。麦克阿瑟的玩具、日本的卖国贼吉田，更恬不知耻地以“事实上的和平”为烟幕，来欢迎美国的长期占领。
    美日反动派的这些策划和阴谋，违反波茨坦宣言的原则，违反莫斯科三外长会议的协议，同时违反日本人民的利益和要求。日本人民要求缔结全面和约，反对任何形式的片面和约；要求早日撤退占领军，反对长期占领和军事基地化；要求和平经济的恢复和发展，反对把日本作为“亚洲的兵工厂”；要求民主化，反对军国主义化。在有六十万人参加的东京五一大示威中，在有十万人参加的东京《五·三○人民大会》中，在反意尔斯事件的全国学生抗议运动中，在东宝电影制片厂及日立制作所工人的反解雇罢工运动中，都提出了这些口号。团结在日本共产党周围的日本人民，把这些口号作为他们争取和平、民主、独立的具体目标，因而这些口号已经成为日本民主民族战线的共同行动纲领。日本人民的这种巨大力量，在美日反动派准备进攻中苏两国和亚洲各国人民的新战争的道路上，竖起了一座不可逾越的障碍物。麦克阿瑟和吉田的新暴行，正是美日反动派感到惶恐不安的反映。
    美日反动派的高压手段，绝对不可能使已经奋起的日本人民屈服。日本人民不是孤立的。他们的正义的斗争——要求缔结全面和约、反对长期占领的斗争，要求独立和民主、反对奴役和法西斯化的斗争——将获得亚洲各国人民、首先是中国人民的声援。胜利是属于人民的。
