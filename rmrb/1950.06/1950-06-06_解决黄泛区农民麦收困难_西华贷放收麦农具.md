Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 2nd. In order to solve the difficulty of lacking wheat harvesting tools for farmers in the Yellow River flood area, the Xihua County People's Government of Henan Province allocated part of the 1.2 million catties of grain loaned by the Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Bureau, under the Central People's Government's Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Committee, to farmers in the county's flood area for purchasing agricultural tools and building materials. They purchased more than 37,000 pieces of agricultural tools, including sickles, brooms, and wooden shovels, and loaned them to farmers in the county's flood area in mid-May at half the market price. The county People's Government also allocated another portion of grain to purchase more than 5,600 pieces of agricultural tools and loaned them to farmers in the county's second district, which was more severely affected by the disaster. This year, Xihua has 800,000 mu of wheat fields. Due to sufficient spring rain, the wheat ears are large and the grains are full. The fields are now golden and ready for harvesting.

    【新华社开封二日电】为着解决黄泛区农民缺少收麦农具的困难，河南省西华县人民政府，在中央人民政府黄泛区复兴委员会所属泛区复兴局贷给该县黄泛区农民购买农具和建房材料的粮食一百二十万斤中拨出一部，购买了镰刀、扫帚、木锨等农具共三万七千余件，于五月中旬以低于市价一半作价，贷予该县泛区的农民。该县人民政府并另拨贷粮一部，购农具五千六百余件，贷予该县灾情较重的第二区农民。西华今年麦田达八十万亩，由于春雨充足，麦子穗大籽满，现已一片金黄，即可开镰。
