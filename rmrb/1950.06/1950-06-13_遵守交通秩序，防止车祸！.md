　　Observe Traffic Order, Prevent Traffic Accidents!
    Since the beginning of spring this year, traffic order in Beijing has gradually become chaotic again. As of May 25th, a total of 66 traffic accidents have occurred. In February alone, there were 18 traffic accidents. The main cause of traffic accidents is the carelessness of drivers. The following factors also contributed to the increase in traffic accidents: pedestrians not using sidewalks; mobile vendors in busy areas occupying sidewalks or roads; animal-drawn vehicles not traveling in designated slow lanes, sometimes due to frightened animals or failure to avoid other vehicles (animal-drawn vehicles accounted for 17 accidents, which is a serious phenomenon); illegal parking (mostly pedicabs); failure to turn on lights when driving at night (mostly bicycles); and pedicabs and bicycles racing and riding side-by-side. In addition, traffic management departments are also quite lax in some areas, only emphasizing persuasion and education for vehicles and pedestrians who violate regulations, neglecting necessary penalties, and therefore failing to "learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones." Some provisions in the traffic regulations promulgated last September are no longer in line with the current situation, and the competent authorities have failed to revise and supplement them in a timely manner, causing some traffic police officers to adopt an irresponsible attitude of "unable to manage" and "afraid to manage." In terms of traffic management, in the past, only key sections of trunk lines were managed, neglecting overall control, and when traffic accidents increased, no effective measures were taken in a timely manner. On the other hand, during the Spring Festival, government agencies and organizations were on vacation, and vehicles and pedestrians were concentrated in busy areas, resulting in a sudden increase of traffic accidents to as many as 18 in February. In recent months, due to the dredging of the Three Seas and the renovation of roads and underground drains, the number of vehicles has increased and the road surface has been reduced. These are objective reasons for the increase in traffic accidents.
    The disorder of traffic directly caused losses to the people's lives and property. In the 66 traffic accidents, a total of 18 people died (11 children under the age of 15) and 40 people were injured. The loss of vehicles and property in the past five months is estimated to be worth about 60,997 kilograms of millet.
    In order to learn from experience and carry out comprehensive traffic management, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau conducted key inspections of violations from May 16th to 22nd. In the 190,548 inspections, 15,051 bicycle violations and 5,994 pedestrian violations were found. It can be seen from this inspection that the habit of observing traffic order among the people of Beijing still needs to be actively cultivated and educated. It should be recognized that traffic order is a part of revolutionary order; observing traffic rules is obeying the laws of the People's Government and is a touchstone for testing the spirit of abiding by the law.
    The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, accepting the suggestions of the Municipal Consultative Conference in late May and the lessons learned from the traffic accidents in the past five months, decided to launch a comprehensive traffic management campaign from June 1st. The traffic regulations have been revised and promulgated. The traffic police officers have been trained in batches in May. In the future, all vehicle drivers in the city are required to be highly vigilant, cautious, strictly abide by traffic rules, absolutely obey the command of traffic police, and avoid traffic accidents. Responsible comrades and supervisors of various agencies and units should also regularly check whether the vehicles of their affiliated units comply with traffic rules.
    The people of the whole city should further promote the spirit of being masters of the country, jointly observe traffic rules, and cherish the traffic order of their capital.

　　遵守交通秩序，防止车祸！
    京市交通秩序，自今年入春以来，又渐趋紊乱。截至五月二十五日止，共发生车祸六十六起。仅二月份车祸即达十八起。造成车祸的主要原因，是驾驶员疏忽大意。下面的几个因素，也促成了车祸的增多：行人不走便道；在热闹地区的游击摊贩，占据了便道或马路；兽力车不在规定的慢车道上行驶，有时牲畜受惊，或不及躲闪其他车辆发生车祸（兽力车在车祸中占十七起，实为一严重现象）；不按规定停车（最多的是三轮车）；晚间行车不点灯（最多的是自行车）；三轮车和自行车抢行、并行。此外交通管理部门，在某些地方也相当松懈，对于违章的车辆和行人，只强调说服教育，忽略必要的处罚，因而不能达到“惩前毖后”。去年九月公布的交通规则中的某些规定，已不切合目前情况，主管方面未能及时修正补充，使有的交通警士发生了“无法管”、“不敢管”的不负责任态度。在交通整理方面，过去也只作了干线的重点整理，忽略了全面的掌握，车祸一旦增多，亦未及时采取有效的制止。另一方面：春节期间，机关、团体休假，车辆、行人集中热闹地区，二月份车祸遂突增至十八次之多。近几个月来，因挖掏三海及翻修马路、暗沟等工程，车辆增多，路面缩小。这是车祸增多的客观原因。
    交通秩序的紊乱，直接造成了人民生命财产的损失。六十六起车祸中，共死十八人（十一名十五岁以下的小孩），伤四十人。车物方面五个月来的损失约值小米六○、九九七斤。
    为吸取经验，展开全面的交通整理，京市公安局于五月十六日至二十二日止，举行了重点的违章检查。在检查的一九○、五四八次中，查出自行车违章者一五、○五一起；行人违章者五、九九四人。从这次检查中可以看出，京市人民对于遵守交通秩序的习惯，还亟待积极培养教育。应该认识到，交通秩序是革命秩序中的一部分；遵守交通规则是服从人民政府的法令，是考验守法精神的试金石。
    京市公安局接受五月下旬市协商会议的建议，和五个月来车祸的教训，决于六月一日起展开全面的交通整理。交通规则已重新修订公布。五月份并已将交通警士分批轮训完毕。今后，要求全市的车辆驾驶员，应有高度的警惕，谨慎小心，恪守交通规则，绝对服从交通警的指挥，避免车祸发生。各机关、部队的负责同志和主管人员，也应经常检查所属单位车辆，是否遵守交通规则。
    全市人民，更应发扬国家主人翁的精神，共同遵守交通规则，爱护自己的首都的交通秩序。
