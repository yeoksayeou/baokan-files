　　Our Army on Zhoushan Islands Donates Money to Help Disaster Victims
　　After the People's Liberation Army unit liberating the Zhoushan Islands landed on Daishan Island, they immediately formed three work groups to conduct propaganda among the residents, investigate the difficulties of the masses, open the port, and provide armed protection for fishermen. Within fifteen days, the machine gun company of the first battalion of a certain regiment helped the masses harvest 55 mu of wheat, and plow, plant rice and sorghum on 22 mu of land, and carry 947 loads of water. The landlady of the ninth squad of the machine gun company of the second battalion of a certain regiment ran out of food because her son was arrested. The soldiers of the ninth squad automatically donated 34,000 yuan to buy rice for her. Wu Zhonghuo, the deputy squad leader and Communist Party member, donated all of his May allowance except for the Party dues. The machine gun company of the first battalion of a certain regiment donated 160,000 yuan to help disaster victims; all the commanders and fighters of the first company of a certain regiment voluntarily skipped lunch to save grain to help disaster victims.
　　Slide Show “Not a Cicada” Very Popular with Audiences
　　Recently, the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Education Center turned the comedy "Not a Cicada" created by Wei Lianzhen, a worker in the city, into a seven-color slide show, which was shown in factories, theaters, and streets, accompanied by explanations using loudspeakers, and was very popular with audiences. The center now plans to reproduce and sell the slide show, and offer preferential treatment to factories in various places to purchase it. (Zhang Yong)
　　Yuanshi, Mancheng and Other Counties Use Temple Fairs for Propaganda
　　Yuanshi, Mancheng and other counties in Hebei Province use the folk spring temple fairs to hold mobile picture and model exhibitions. The exhibition propaganda includes agricultural production, maternal and child health, and cultural propaganda. Serial pictures, paintings, photographs, models, and government laws and documents are displayed, and people are responsible for explanations. The visiting farmers carefully observed and inquired about the hanging pictures and photographs of high-quality varieties and prevention of diseases and insect pests, and new agricultural tools. Some also copied down methods for treating insects and jaundice. In the maternal and child health exhibition, many women invited friends to watch for several days, and repeatedly asked about the disinfection of umbilical cord cutting and the treatment of infant asphyxia. When explaining the Marriage Law, many people raised their concerns and asked the explainers to answer them. (Zhang Linou, Jia Shifang, etc.)
