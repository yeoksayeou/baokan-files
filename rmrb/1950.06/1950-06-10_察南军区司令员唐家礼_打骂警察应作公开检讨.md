To the Editor:

    On May 11th, at around 5:00 PM, as we were passing through the south gate of Xuanhua city, we saw Tang Jiali, Commander of the Chahar Southern Military Sub-district (currently stationed inside Xuanhua city), riding a bicycle into the city gate. Because his bicycle did not have a new license plate (The Municipal Public Security Bureau announced: Old license plates must be replaced from April 20th to 30th. In addition to posting notices on the streets, the Chahar Southern Sub-district was also notified twice by phone.), traffic police officer Sun Futao immediately stopped him for questioning. However, Commander Tang ignored him and continued riding his bicycle forward. The police officer caught up and stopped the bicycle, asking, "Comrade, why don't you have a license plate?" "I don't have one!" "The Public Security Bureau announced that without a license plate, passage is prohibited. We must enforce the law." But Commander Tang acted stubbornly and unreasonably, saying, "I am the Commander! My surname is Tang, why are you such a bastard! Otherwise, come with me to the Chahar Southern Sub-district Headquarters." Police officer Sun Futao said very politely, "This is the order from above, I cannot disobey it." Thereupon, the Commander began to shout abuse even louder, and with one hand grabbed the bicycle while hitting Sun Futao twice in the chest with the other. The onlookers were very surprised and discussed among themselves, "Why is a commander of the People's Liberation Army acting so unreasonably?" After the incident, at 7:00 PM that evening, Section Chief Han Wenyao of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and Comrade Sun Jinglu of the Public Security Brigade went to the Headquarters to understand the details of what had happened. Commander Tang declined to meet them, claiming to be busy.

    Comrade Tang Jiali, as the Commander of the Chahar Southern Military Sub-district of the People's Liberation Army, actually beat and swore at a People's Police officer, fully demonstrating serious warlordism. We hope that Commander Tang will make a profound self-criticism of this matter and publish it in the newspaper.

    CCP Xuanhua Municipal Committee, Tian Zhentian

    Editor's Note: We received this report on May 13th. Before receiving this letter, the Xuanhua Municipal Committee made a long-distance call, saying that the matter was under investigation and asking us to postpone publication. After ten days, we still had not received a reply from them. On May 23rd, a special reporter from this newspaper went to the area to investigate. At that time, the Municipal Party Secretary and the Minister of Organization both said, "Commander Tang did not hit anyone, he only pushed the police comrade twice. Therefore, this report does not need to be published." After our reporter returned to Beijing, this newspaper sent another letter to the Xuanhua Municipal Public Security Bureau, inquiring about the truth of the matter. On the 8th, we received their reply, saying that the matter had been dealt with and did not need to be published; that it was not inconsistent with the facts.

    We believe that the act of revolutionary soldiers beating and swearing at people at will is a serious act of warlordism, and should be published in the newspaper to educate all revolutionary workers. We hope that Comrade Tang Jiali will make a public apology.

　　察南军区司令员唐家礼打骂警察应作公开检讨编辑同志：
    五月十一日下午五点多钟，我们路过宣化城南门时，见到察南军分区（现驻宣化城内）司令员唐家礼骑着自行车进城门。因为他的自行车没有新车牌（市公安局布告：自四月二十日至三十日换掉旧车牌。除大街上贴过布告外，也曾打电话告诉过察南分区两次。），交通警察孙福桃同志当即阻止询问，但唐司令员连理也不理，照常骑着车子往前行。该警察赶上前去拦住车子发问：“同志，你怎么没车牌呢？”“没有！”“公安局布告：无车牌子，禁止通行。我们要执行法令。”而唐司令员却蛮横不讲理的说道：“我是司令员！我姓唐，你怎那么混蛋呀！不然跟我到察南分区司令部去。”警察孙福桃同志还很和气的说：“这是上级的命令，我不能违抗。”于是该司令员更加放声大骂，并且一手夺车子，一手就照着孙福桃的前胸打了两拳。围看的行人都很惊奇，纷纷议论：“为什么解放军的司令员还这样不讲理？”事情发生后，当晚七时市公安局韩文耀科长及公安大队孙景禄同志前去该司令部了解事情发生的详细情况。唐司令员推托有事不在，不予接见。
    唐家礼同志身为人民解放军察南军分区司令员，竟打骂人民警察，十足地表现了严重的军阀主义行为。我们希望唐司令员对这一件事情作深刻的自我检讨，并在报上公开发表。
    中共宣化市委会  田震田
    编者按：这篇报道，我们是在五月十三日收到的。在接到此信以前，宣化市委即来长途电话，说此事正在调查中，叫暂缓发表。过了十天，我们还未得到他们的回音。五月二十三日本报特派专人亲往该处调查。当时市委书记与组织部长都说：“唐司令员并没有打人，只是把警察同志推了二下。因此，这个报道就不必发表。”本报记者回京后，本报又给宣化市公安局去了一封信，询问此事真相。八日即得到他们的回答，又说此事业已处理，不需发表了；并非与事实不符。
    我们认为，革命军人随便打人骂人的行动，完全是一种严重的军阀主义行为，应当在报上公开发表，以教育全体革命工作者。并希望唐家礼同志作公开检讨。
