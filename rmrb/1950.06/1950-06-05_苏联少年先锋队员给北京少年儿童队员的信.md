A Letter from Soviet Young Pioneers to Beijing Young Pioneers

Dear Young Pioneers of Beijing:

    We hope to establish close comradely friendship with you. We are writing to you about the situation of the Young Pioneers.

    Our poet C. Mikhalkov once wrote about friendship like this:

    He who believes fervently in friendship,
    He who feels shoulder to shoulder;
    He will never fall,
    He will not fall in any difficulty.
    Even if he stumbles by chance,
    His friends will help him up.
    He will always have friends to help him,
    Always have reliable friends,
    To lend a hand in times of difficulty.

    Young friends, we have learned about the various situations in your country from the newspapers. All the people of the Soviet Union are rejoicing over the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in crushing the Kuomintang bandit army and liberating all of China. In this struggle, the strength of the Chinese people has been forged.

    The victory of the Chinese people is celebrated by the people of the world! The Soviet Union has always been deeply concerned about the heroic struggle of the Chinese people and enthusiastically cheers for the birth of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the Central People's Government.

    We know that the Chinese people, led by the experienced leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, stand firmly in the ranks of the world's democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    Your fathers, brothers, and sisters have ensured your happy childhood. You are now studying freely in schools. Young Pioneers teams will now be established in your schools. According to the academic performance, conduct, and social work of the Young Pioneers, the best students from each school will be admitted into its ranks.

    In our country, the Young Pioneer organization was founded in 1922. But in 1924, when our leader Lenin passed away, the Young Pioneer organization was named after Lenin. We proudly call ourselves "Young Leninists".

    In our seven-year school's children's team, there are a total of 240 members. Our detachment is named after the heroic members of our district, Yelena and Vitaliya, and Gorubatnikova. They were shot dead by the German army when the German fascist army occupied the area. We Young Pioneers all wear red scarves. This signifies a piece of the red battle flag that our fathers and grandfathers used to fight in the days of October 1917.

    We have a five-point grading system in our school. The worst grade is one point, and the highest grade is five points. It is of course not easy to get five points. But many Young Pioneers have scored five points. The outstanding Young Pioneers are rewarded in front of the unfolded team flag by the team meeting and the principal during the school year; at the end of the school year, they receive certificates—the best awards. All members of our school have joined the Red Cross Association.

    We all carry out our work in the team according to plan. The plan is drawn up by ourselves at the team meeting. We make interesting visits, marches, walks, and gatherings. At the Young Pioneer meetings, we learn about new things in our beloved motherland and abroad.

    We know that the Young Pioneers of Hungary wear blue scarves. But when they received the red scarves presented by the Young Pioneers of our capital, Moscow, those outstanding Hungarian members began to wear red scarves. Now hundreds of thousands of Young Pioneers in Hungary are wearing red scarves.

    We ask you, our friends, the Chinese Young Pioneers, to write to us about the work of your Young Pioneers organizations, the color of your scarves, and your studies at school.

    Enclosed with this letter is a red Young Pioneer scarf.

    Looking forward to your reply.

    In Young Pioneer salute!

   Soviet Krasnodar, Third Bryukhovets Seven-Year School

### 苏联少年先锋队员给北京少年儿童队员的信

专栏：

　　苏联少年先锋队员给北京少年儿童队员的信北京市亲爱的少年儿童队员们：
    我们希望和你们建立密切的同志友谊。我们将少年先锋队的情形写给你们。
    关于友谊，我们的诗人Ｃ·米哈尔阔夫曾经这样写道：
    谁对友谊信仰热烈，
    谁感觉着肩头并列；
    谁就永不跌落，
    在任何困难中不至堕落。
    即或偶然失足，
    帮他起立也有朋友。
    帮助他的永远有朋友，
    永远有可信赖的朋友，
    在困难之中援之以手。
    年青的朋友们，我们在报纸上知道了你们国内的种种情况。我们全苏人民都为中国人民解放军粉碎国民党匪军、解放全中国的胜利而欢欣。在这一斗争中，中国人民的力量，锻炼出来了。
    中国人民的胜利受到全世界人民的庆祝！苏联永远深切地关怀着中国人民的英勇斗争，并为中华人民共和国的诞生和中央人民政府的成立，而热烈地欢呼。
    我们知道：中国人民，由中国共产党经验丰富的领袖领导着，在以苏联为首的世界民主阵营的行列中坚决地站起来了。
    你们的父亲、哥哥、姊姊们保障了你们的幸运童年。你们现在自由地在学校里学习着。在你们各学校里现在都将建立少年儿童队。按着少年儿童们的学习成绩、品行和社会工作，将各校的好学生都吸收在自己的行列里面来了。
    在我们国内，少年先锋队的组织是在一九二二年间成立的。可是在一九二四年，当我们领袖列宁逝世的时候，少年先锋队的组织冠上了列宁的名字。我们就很自傲地把自己叫做“青年列宁主义者”了。
    在我们七年学校的儿童队里，共有二百四十个队员。我们的支队以我们这区的英雄队员叶琳娜和维达里亚、郭鲁巴特妮阔娃命名。她们是在被德国法西斯军队占领本区的时候，被德国人的枪弹打死的。我们少先队员们都结着红色领巾。这是意味着我们的父亲和祖父在一九一七年十月的那些日子，打仗用的红色战斗旗帜的一片。
    我们学校里实行五点计分制。最坏的分数是一点，最高的分数是五点。要得到五点，当然不大容易。可是有许多少年先锋队员的分数得到了五点。少年先锋队员的优秀者，在学年中站在展开的队旗前面，由队会议和校长予以奖励；在学年末受奖状——最优的奖品。我们学校的全体队员都参加了红十字协会。
    我们都照计划在队里进行工作。计划是我们自己在队会议上制订的。我们作有意思的参观、行军、散步、集会。在少年先锋队会上，我们知道可爱的祖国和国外的新事物。
    我们知道匈牙利的少先队员都结着蓝色领巾。可是，当他们得到我们首都莫斯科少年先锋队员所送的红色领巾礼品之后，那些优秀的匈牙利队员们就开始结起红色领巾来了。现在匈牙利成千成万的少年先锋队员们都结上红色领巾了。
    我们请你们，我们的朋友们，中国少先队员们，将你们少年儿童队组织的工作、你们的领巾颜色、你们在学校读书的情况，都写信告诉我们。
    随着这封信寄给你们一条红色少年先锋队的领巾。
    期待着你们的回信。
    此致少年先锋队敬礼！
   苏联克拉斯诺达尔，第三布留霍魏茨七年学校
