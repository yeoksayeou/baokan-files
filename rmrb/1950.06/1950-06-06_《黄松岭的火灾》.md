　　《The Fire at Huangsongling》
    Poem by Ma Xun, Painting by Su Jian
    Starting today, this publication will serialize the poem and painting "The Fire at Huangsongling." It was originally published in the Northeast Pictorial. The complete work consists of twenty-six images. The content describes the story of the serious destruction suffered by the Huangsongling Forestry Farm in Northeast China under the bureaucratic leadership of the director of the Forestry Bureau. At the same time, it also depicts the situation of the farm's reconstruction beginning under the leadership of worker Zhao Jinglin.

     (I)
    The people's motherland has endless treasures,
    The forest of Huangsongling is as deep as a green ocean.
    If industrial construction lacks timber,
    It's like a ship stranded in a dry sea.

    Although there are birdsong and the sound of wind in the pine forest,
    They are not as magnificent and pleasing as the music of labor;
    The sound of saws, the sound of felling trees, the sound of trees falling
    Ring out near and far—
    Like the ebb and flow on the seashore!

    The loggers of the Forestry Bureau are working very hard.
    They suffered persecution in the past,
    Today they are the masters of the forest.
    They saw down ancient pines and cypresses, one after another,
    They dedicate their enthusiasm and strength to the motherland!
　 (II)

    In the vast forest farm, logs lie one after another;
    Lovely timber, what are you talking about?
    Are you discussing your aspirations?
    Forming a queue, flowing down the mountain—
    To dedicate yourselves in the great construction of the motherland?

    Labor is the mother of wealth,
    Tell me: which child is not moved by maternal love?
    Here on this forest farm, timber is piled up like mountains,
    Which log does not have the sweat and blood of the mother flowing through it?
　 (III)

    White clouds bring the news of spring,
    Spring wind fills the land, ice and snow melt away!
    Three people are sitting on the timber pile in the forest farm:
    In the middle is the newly appointed director of the Forestry Bureau,
    Beside him are two people:
    One is the secret agent Yan Guaitou,
    The other is the worker Zhao Jinglin.

    Zhao Jinglin pointed to the boundless weeds,
    Saying: "Spring weeds are most prone to fire,
    Fire prevention in the forest farm should be thoroughly carried out!"
    Having turned over from the bitter days, Zhao Jinglin,
    Keeps the people's wealth close to his heart! (Attached picture)

### 《黄松岭的火灾》

　　《黄松岭的火灾》
    马寻诗  苏坚画
    本刊今日起连载《黄松岭的火灾》诗画。它原来曾在东北画报上发表过。全图共二十六幅。内容系描写东北黄松岭林场，在林务所所长的官僚主义的领导下，遭受到严重破坏的故事。同时又写出了该林场在工人赵景林领导下开始重建的情形。
     （一）
    人民的祖国有着无限的宝藏，
    黄松岭的森林，深得像苍绿的海洋。
    工业建设中如果缺少木材，
    就像行船搁浅在枯干的海。
　
    松林里虽说有鸟语、风声，
    却不如那劳动的音乐雄壮动听；
    拉锯声、砍树声、树木倾倒声
    响在近处又响在远方——
    就像那大海滩上的来潮和退浪！
　
    林务局伐木工友干得十分起劲。
    他们过去受迫害，
    今天做了森林的主人。
    锯倒了苍松古柏，一棵又一棵，
    他们把热情和力量，奉献给祖国！
　 （二）
　
    在广大的林场上，木材一棵棵躺下；
    可爱的木材呀，你们在说什么话？
    是谈论着你们的志趣？
    排成队伍，流下山去——
    在伟大的祖国建设中，献出自己？
　
    劳动是创造财富的母亲，
    请问：那一个儿女不受母爱的感动？
    这林场上木材堆积成山，
    那一棵身上不流着母亲的血汗？
　 （三）
　
    白云捎来了春天的音讯，
    满地春风，冰雪融尽！
    林场木垛上坐着三个人：
    当中的是新到任的林务所长，
    身旁两个人：
    一个是特务阎怪头，
    一个是工人赵景林。
　
    赵景林手指着那漫天的荒草，
    说：“春天的荒草最招火烧，
    林场的防火应当彻底搞一搞！”
    从苦日子翻过身来的赵景林，
    人民的财富紧放在心！（附图片）
