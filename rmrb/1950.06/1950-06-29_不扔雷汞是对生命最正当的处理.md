　　Not Throwing Mercury Fulminate is the Most Proper Handling of Life
    Zheng Tianxiang
    My understanding is completely opposite to the opinions of Wang Zhihong and Nai Dong. I believe that this is not a question of cadres being less important at present and more important when there are more machines in the future, but rather that this issue should be analyzed from the relationship between the individual interests of party members and the overall interests of the party. Comrade Zhao Guilan's actions are a concrete manifestation of the effectiveness of the Party's education and a vivid expression of the noblest qualities of a Communist Party member. If a party member does not bravely sacrifice personal interests to take care of the overall interests of the Party and the people in the most dangerous time, but instead thinks about how "living is important" and that living can continuously engage in revolutionary work, then that person has fundamentally lost the qualities that a Communist Party member should have. If one retreats in the face of danger, thinking that sacrificing oneself this time is not worthwhile, and waits for something worthwhile to sacrifice for; then next time when encountering danger, one thinks that sacrificing is not worthwhile, and waits for something even more worthwhile to sacrifice for! If this continues, there will never be anything worth sacrificing for. May I ask, where is the preciousness of such a life that is greedy for life and afraid of death, and retreats in the face of danger? Comrade Zhao Guilan's behavior is correct, and only in this way can one understand why cadres are valuable and why life is valuable. This is the most proper handling of life. Conversely, being greedy for life and afraid of death is precisely the devaluation of life and an improper handling of life.

    我的认识与汪志鸿和耐冬的意见完全相反。我认为，不是在目前干部较次要，将来机器多了干部较重要的问题，而是应该从党员个人利益与党的整体利益的关系来分析这个问题。赵桂兰同志这样作是党的教育效能的具体表现，也是共产党员最高贵品质的生动表现。如果一个党员在最危急的时候不勇敢的牺牲个人利益顾全党和人民的整体利益，而去想个人怎样“活着重要”，活着就可以不断的从事革命工作等等，那就根本失去了一个共产党员应有的品质。如果临难而退缩，想着这次牺牲了个人不值得，等有值得牺牲的事再牺牲吧；待到下次遭遇到危难时，又想牺牲不值得，等到有更值得的事情时再牺牲吧！这样下去就永远不会有值得你牺牲的事了。试问这样贪生怕死、临难不前的生命的可贵在那里呢？赵桂兰同志的行为是对的，只有如此才能理解干部之所以宝贵，生命之所以宝贵。这是对生命的最正当的处理。反之，贪生怕死正是生命的贬值，是对生命的不正当处理。
