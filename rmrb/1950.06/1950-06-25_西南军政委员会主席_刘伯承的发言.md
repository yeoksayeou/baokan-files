Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: The following is the full text of the speech given by Liu Bocheng, Chairman of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 22nd: Chairman, fellow committee members, and comrades:

	I have listened to Chairman Mao's instructions and the reports of the leading comrades of the Central People's Government on land reform, finance and economy, politics, military affairs, culture and education, and court work, and I fully agree with and support their implementation.

	Regarding the struggle against the enemy: The Southwest Region is the last administrative region in the country to be liberated. It is also an area where the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's army made its last stand on the mainland, relying on feudal forces to meticulously plan and transform into bandit guerrilla and espionage activities. Since the end of the Southwest Liberation Campaign at the end of last year, we have been carrying out bandit suppression and launching the advance into Tibet, and the military operations are not yet fully completed. Before the liberation of the Southwest, Chiang's henchmen such as Mao Renfeng gathered local bullies and habitual bandits in Sichuan Province alone, training as many as 5,000 so-called guerrilla cadres. After liberation, with the support of American and British imperialism, they directed the so-called guerrilla warfare in the Southwest from the southwest border and key mountainous areas within the country. In March of this year, the number of bandits in the Southwest Region reached 400,000, who committed murder, arson, and sabotaged production, causing great harm to the masses. In implementing Chairman Mao's policy of severely punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding those who performed meritorious service, we initially relaxed the suppression of the ringleaders, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. More than 2,000 of our personnel who were dispersed to do mass work were killed, and this does not include the casualties of our army on the battlefield. Later, this deviation was corrected. As of May, approximately 1,000 bandit leaders captured on the bandit suppression battlefield in the Southwest were executed with the approval of the military regions and administrative offices of various provinces. However, at this time, someone in Chengdu wrote to us saying, "Don't commit excessive killings," he did not see the even greater and more tragic killings of the masses and mass workers. While comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's policy and closely combining with the broad masses, the troops also reviewed their unfamiliar guerrilla tactics. Senior cadres went to the front lines to fight alongside the troops, not shunning difficulties and dangers, and attacking bandit gangs. Especially since the elimination of the command headquarters of the bandits in Xichang, by the end of May, 220,000 bandits had been eliminated. Large bandit gangs have already been wiped out, and the plains and transportation lines have been purified. The number of bandits who surrendered and reformed exceeded the number of those killed or wounded by more than two-thirds. This fierce struggle of bandit suppression work can be considered a basic victory. We will develop and organize the masses, unite people from all walks of life, and work together to implement the policy of combining suppression and leniency to complete the task of eliminating bandits. Especially in areas close to the border, such as Yunnan, we should be diligent and conscientious to complete this task. In the future, in the establishment of southwest national defense, in urban and rural production, in rent reduction after the autumn harvest, and in subsequent land reform and people's court work, in short, in the process of the victory of the people's great revolution, imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism will never willingly see their reactionary rule of exploitation and freedom overthrown in this way. It is already and inevitably the case that their secret agents, local bullies, and other counter-revolutionary elements will stubbornly struggle to sow discord and sabotage. Our democratic classes and other patriotic people must raise their vigilance, unite as one, and correctly implement the instructions of Article 7 of the Common Program to suppress counter-revolutionary activities and transform them into new people.

	Regarding united front work: Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, before the three conditions for achieving a basic improvement in the financial and economic situation are realized, the democratic classes and other patriotic people will all face difficulties. Taking the Southwest as an example, for example, it is still necessary to liberate Tibet so that it can implement regional autonomy, establish southwest national defense, eliminate bandits, and receive 900,000 Kuomintang troops, 400,000 former personnel, plus the People's Liberation Army, there are a total of 2 million people to feed, which must be strongly supported and supplied. However, the deficit is still large, and to this day, the Southwest Region still relies on subsidies from the Central Ministry of Finance. The rent reduction work to be done now and the subsequent land reform work have not yet been carried out. After striving for a largely stable price level, although the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has also begun, loans have been given to the shipping industry to restore it, and revolutionary universities have been opened, some adjustments have been made to the resumption of industry and commerce, and some assistance has been given to employment and schooling, but in the future, industry and commerce still need to be vigorously adjusted, and unemployed workers and students still need relief. At the same time, in order to save national expenditures, the army must also be partially demobilized and assigned to production. These difficulties are difficulties in victory that we all know. We have jointly consulted on ways to overcome difficulties in people's representative conferences and other meetings at all levels; for example: to solve public-private and labor-capital issues, the capital side, the government, and the workers have earnestly consulted to resolve them. Although there may be some differences of opinion due to inadequate consideration of all parties, in the end, it is still possible to unite in accordance with the principles of the Common Program and overcome some difficulties, which of course is far from enough. In the future, we will continue to unite in the spirit of this consultative conference and, under the leadership of the Central Government, pool our efforts to fight for the basic improvement of the national financial and economic situation.

	Regarding cadre rectification work: Some people say that our cadres are "good at the upper level and not good at the lower level," I don't think it should be said that way. One part of our cadres working in the Southwest Region are cadres who went south and former underground party cadres, one part are students, especially students from the Shanghai-Nanjing area, and students from the Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang regions, and another part are former personnel from various places. Some of these working cadres did indeed commit commandism and bureaucratism in the collection of grain taxes and bandit suppression, and even individual people committed corruption, degeneration, violated laws and discipline, thus causing the phenomenon of detachment from the masses. Some cadres even opposed the completion of tasks to national policies and laws, with a rigid attitude and acting arbitrarily, and even the phenomenon of random beatings and arrests occurred. This is all due to the lack of education of our upper-level cadres. But this must be seen in the main aspects, especially for the cadres who went south: they have been tested in the life-and-death struggle between the enemy and ourselves: they are loyal, hardworking and simple, and fearless in the face of the enemy, and they have made many achievements in liberating the Southwest, suppressing bandits, and stabilizing prices. The revolution should naturally rely on such people to do it. There are also those who, when collecting grain, saw that the land was very concentrated and the peasants were the first to enthusiastically pay the grain, while the local bullies and landlords delayed and denied payment, and a large number had not been paid, especially when the peasants accused the local bullies of never paying grain in the past and shifting the burden to the peasants, they were very angry. In addition, they were not familiar with the situation in the new area, the burden was not entirely appropriate, and it was not adjusted in time. The bandits and special agents then took the opportunity to stir up trouble and obstruct it, so commandism also occurred. This must be corrected by promoting criticism and self-criticism in the general cadre rectification and policy review, and students and former personnel must undergo in-depth education and transformation. Special attention should be paid to educating all cadres that, when carrying out rent reduction and establishing mass organizations after the autumn harvest, they must rely on the masses and follow the mass line, and promote a democratic work style. Past experience in rent reduction and land reform has proven that: if leaders can enlighten the masses' awareness and rely on the masses to carry out work, so that the top-down and bottom-up can be coordinated, commandism and bureaucratism can be greatly reduced. We believe that after this cadre rectification, they will definitely take a step forward politically and a step forward in their work style, and they will definitely be able to unite a broader mass of people and more appropriately complete the tasks given to us by the Central Government.

    西南军政委员会主席
    刘伯承的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】西南军政委员会主席刘伯承二十二日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    这次会议听了毛主席指示及中央人民政府各位首长关于土地改革、财政经济、政治、军事、文教、法院工作报告，我完全同意与拥护实施。
    关于对敌人斗争：西南区是全国最后解放的一个行政区，也是蒋介石匪帮军队在大陆上最后挣扎并依托封建力量周密布置，转化为土匪游击与特务活动的一个区域。我们自去年年底结束了解放西南的会战，跟着进行剿匪与开始进行解放西藏的进军，军事还没有完全结束。西南解放以前蒋匪毛人凤辈仅在四川一省招集恶霸惯匪等训练所谓游击干部即有五千之多，解放之后即在美英帝国主义支持之下，在西南国界以及国内山地要点指挥所谓西南的游击战争，今年三月西南全区土匪曾达四十万人，杀人放火，破坏生产，人民大众受害极大，我们在执行毛主席首恶必办胁从不问立功受奖政策时，开始曾放松了对首恶的镇压，引起了人民大众的不满，我们分散做群众工作的人员，被杀害者即有两千余人之多，我军在战场上伤亡者尚不在此内。后来这种偏向是纠正了，在西南剿匪战场上捉到的土匪头子经各省军区行署批准枪毙者至五月止约一千人，但此时成都有一个人给我们写信说“你们不要犯杀机”，他并未看到人民大众与群众工作者被杀害之更多更惨。我们在全面执行毛主席这种政策并与广大群众密切结合的同时，部队也把生疏了的游击战术温习回来，高级干部亲上前线与部队一起作战，不避艰险，打击股匪，特别在扫除了西昌土匪指挥的首脑机关以来，计到五月底已消灭土匪二十二万，大股土匪业已消灭，平原与交通线上业已净化，投降自新之匪超过其毙伤的数目在三分之二以上。这一场激烈斗争的剿匪工作，算取得了基本的胜利。我们将发展与组织群众并团结各界人民一致努力实行镇压与宽大相结合的政策，以完成肃清土匪的工作，其在接近国境如云南地区，尤应兢兢业业，以完成此项工作。今后在建立西南国防中，在城乡生产中，在秋后减租工作中，和在以后土地改革及其人民法庭工作中，总之，在人民大革命胜利过程中，帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义者总不愿意他们剥削自由的反动统治就这样被推翻下去，已经是也必然是有他们的特务恶霸及其他反革命分子顽强挣扎离间与破坏。我们各民主阶级及其他爱国人士必须提高警惕性，团结一致，正确执行共同纲领第七条的指示镇压反革命活动与改造他们成为新人。
    关于统战工作：全国人民在中央人民政府领导之下，在争取财经情况基本好转的三个条件实现以前，各民主阶级及其他爱国人士都是有困难的。就西南说来，例如还要解放西藏使其能实行区域自治，建立西南国防，肃清土匪，以及接收国民党军队九十万，旧有人员四十万加上解放军共有二百万人要饭吃，这些必须大力支援供给。但赤字还大，至今还靠中央财政部补贴西南区。现在待做的减租与以后土改工作尚未进行。在争取物价大部稳定之后，虽然也着手于成渝铁路的兴筑，贷款给航运业使之恢复及革命大学之开办，于工商复业有所调剂，就业就学有所帮助，但今后工商业还须大力调整，失业工人学生还要救济，同时为节约国家开支，军队还须部分复员安插生产。这些困难乃我们大家所知道的是胜利中的困难。我们曾在各界人民代表会及其他会议上共同协商克服困难办法；例如：解决公私与劳资问题，曾由资方、政府、工人三方切实协商解决，虽其中容或有照顾各方不周而意见有所不同，但最后尚能本共同纲领的原则团结一致克服了若干困难，这当然是非常不够的。今后我们将继续团结一本此次协商会议的精神，在中央政府领导之下，群策群力为实现国家财政经济状况基本好转而斗争。
    关于干部整风工作：有人说我们的干部“上层好下层不好”，我以为不应这样说的。我们入西南区的工作干部人员一部是南下的与原地下党的干部，一部是学生即沪宁地区的学生尤多川滇黔康本地区的学生，另一部是各地旧有人员。这些工作干部人员中有的在征收粮税与剿匪以及在起义部队作政治工作中的确犯了命令主义官僚主义，甚至有个别贪污腐化犯法乱纪的人，从而产生脱离群众的现象。有的干部竟把完成任务与国家政策法令对立起来态度生硬一意孤行，甚至发生乱打乱捕的现象。这都是由于我们上层干部缺乏教育的结果。但这必须在主要方面看到的，特别是对南下的干部要看到的：他们是在敌我生死斗争中久经考验过：忠心耿耿，艰苦朴素在敌人面前奋不顾身，且在解放西南、剿匪与稳定物价等工作中，作了许多成绩出来，革命自然应该靠这样的人去干的。也有在征粮中见到土地非常集中农民首先踊跃完粮，而恶霸地主反拖延抵赖，绝大数目未缴，特别在农民指责恶霸向来不纳粮，把负担转嫁于农民身上时，非常愤慨。加之初入新区情形不熟，负担量不尽恰当，也未及时加以调整。匪特则借题发挥从中煽动梗阻，于是也有发生命令主义的。这在干部普遍整风检讨政策中，必须发扬批评与自我批评改正过来，学生与旧有人员必须深入教育与改造。特别注重教育一切干部，在秋收后进行减租与建立群众组织工作时，必须依托群众走群众路线，发扬民主作风。在以前减租以迄土改工作经验证明：领导者如能启发群众自觉与依靠群众进行工作，以使由上而下与由下而上配合起来，则可大大减少命令主义与官僚主义。我们相信，在干部这次整风以后，他们必能在政治上提高一步，在作风上前进一步，必能团结更广大的群众，更适当地完成中央给予我们的任务。（⑶⑷）
