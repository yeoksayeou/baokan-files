　　Soviet Union's Radio Broadcasting Industry

　　"The Soviet Union has established many radio broadcasting stations. Most towns have their own broadcasting equipment. Radio is also becoming popular in collective farm villages. In 1949 alone, the number of radio sets increased by more than one million, most of which were in rural residential areas. The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government attach great importance to the further development of radio and have set the task of tripling the radio network within five years. This means that radio should be accessible throughout the Soviet Union."
(Excerpt from the speech by the Soviet Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, Pusuerqiefu, on May 7th this year, in commemoration of Radio Day)

　　"The close connection between Soviet radio and its audience is a characteristic of our radio. The All-Union Radio Committee receives thousands of letters from radio listeners every day, and local radio committees also maintain extensive communication with listeners. The vast majority of letters are used in radio broadcasts (music commentary, question and answer sessions, summaries of letters, and others). Listeners' letters provide valuable instructions, suggestions, and criticisms for improving radio broadcasts. These letters reflect the keen concern of Soviet listeners for the quality of radio broadcasts. Therefore, radio broadcasters are required to take a cautious attitude towards listeners' criticisms and more completely answer the increasing number of questions raised by the people." (Excerpt from an essay published in the November 1949 issue of "Radio Magazine" by Labin, Acting Chairman of the Soviet Radio Broadcasting Committee)

　　苏联的无线电广播事业
    “苏联已经设立了许多无线电广播电台。大多数的城镇都有它们自己的广播设备。无线电也在普及到集体农场的乡村中去。单在一九四九年，无线电收音台的数目就增加了一百多万个，大多数都在乡村住民区中。布尔什维克党和苏联政府极为注重无线电的进一步发展，并已规定了任务，要在五年之内把无线电收音网增加三倍。这就是说要把无线电遍及苏联全境。”
   （摘自苏联邮电部长  普苏尔且夫  今年五月七日纪念无线电节的论文）
    “苏联无线电与自己的听众密切地联系着，这是我们的无线电所具有的特点。全苏联无线电委员会每天都接到千百封无线电听众的来信，地方无线电委员会也同样与听众进行着大规模的通信联络。绝大多数的信被用于无线电广播中（音乐解说、问题解答、来信摘要及其他）。听众的来信，具有对改进无线电广播的宝贵指示、建议和批评。这些来信反映出苏联听众对无线电广播质量的敏锐的关心。因此要求无线电广播工作者对听众的批评采取慎重的态度，更完满地回答人民提出的日益增多的质问。”（摘自苏联无线电广播委员会代主席  拉宾  在《无线电杂志》一九四九年十一月号上所发表的论文）
