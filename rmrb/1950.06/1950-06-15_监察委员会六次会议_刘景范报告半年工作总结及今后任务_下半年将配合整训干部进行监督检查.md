　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Government Administration Council's People's Supervisory Committee held its sixth committee meeting on the 12th. The meeting heard Vice Chairman Liu Jingfan's preliminary summary report on the People's Supervisory Committee's work in the past six months and its future work tasks, Deputy Director Cai Yi of the Third Department's report on the inspection of production and disaster relief work, and reports from Committee Members Zhang Nanxian, Dong Luan, and Han Zhao'e on supervisory work in the Central South Region, Hebei, and Shaanxi.

　　In his report, Vice Chairman Liu pointed out that since the People's Supervisory Committee officially began its supervisory work in February this year, supervisory organs at all levels have gained some experience in handling cases, discovered and solved many problems, and thus begun to establish the prestige of the People's Supervisory organs among the people. However, due to objective conditions and insufficient subjective efforts, not enough has been done in advance inspection to prevent accidents; after incidents occur, generally only focusing on investigating responsibility and pointing out the causes of accidents, not enough has been done in conducting in-depth research and specifically pointing out how to improve work.

　　Vice Chairman Liu pointed out that the main work of the People's Supervisory Committee in the second half of the year is: to cooperate with cadre rectification and training, proactively conduct supervision and inspection work, correct the bureaucracy and commandism of public servants at all levels, attach importance to the people's accusations against government agencies and public servants, and select key points for thorough inspection in order to draw experience and promote it to all regions.

　　The meeting discussed the People's Supervisory Committee's inspection of the Government Administration Council and its subordinate agencies' methods for streamlining and economizing, as well as the case of whether administrative supervisory personnel can concurrently hold positions, and formed resolutions; discussed the draft trial regulations for the punishment of derelict public servants, and decided to solicit opinions from all parties in order to revise them and submit them to the Government Administration Council for approval and implementation.

　　监察委员会六次会议
    刘景范报告半年工作总结及今后任务     
    下半年将配合整训干部进行监督检查
    【新华社十二日讯】政务院人民监察委员会十二日举行第六次委员会议。会议听取了刘景范副主任关于人民监察委员会半年来工作的初步总结及今后工作任务的报告、第三厅蔡毅副厅长关于生产救灾工作检查的报告以及张难先、董鲁安、韩兆鹗三委员关于中南区、河北、陕西等地监察工作的报告。
    刘副主任在报告中指出：人民监察委员会自今年二月正式开始监察工作以来，各级监察机关在处理案件中，已取得一些经验，发现与解决了许多问题，因而开始在人民群众中建立了人民监察机关的威信。但是由于客观条件与主观努力不足，在事先检查防止事故发生方面做得不够；事件发生之后，一般只着重追究责任和指出事故原因，对于进行深刻研究，具体指出如何改进工作方面，也做得不够。
    刘副主任指出：人民监察委员会下半年的主要工作是：配合整训干部，主动地进行监督检查工作，纠正各级公务人员的官僚主义与命令主义，重视人民群众对政府机关与公务人员的控告，并选择重点进行彻底检查，以便得出经验，推广各地。
    会议讨论了人民监察委员会检查政务院及所属机关精简节约办法及行政监察人员可否互为兼职案，并制成了决议；讨论了失职公务人员惩戒试行条例草案，决定征求各方意见，以便修正后送呈政务院批准施行。
