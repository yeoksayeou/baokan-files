　　[Beijing News Agency] In order to solve the problem of schooling for children of workers and peasants, and to train worker-peasant cadres, technical personnel, and teachers, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education has decided to add one ordinary middle school and one new-type worker-peasant accelerated middle school after the summer vacation, and to increase the number of classes in municipal middle schools and municipal primary schools.

　　The southern city is the area where the most working people live, but there is not a single municipal middle school. Therefore, the Bureau of Culture and Education has decided to add an ordinary middle school in the southern city. The establishment of a new-type worker-peasant accelerated middle school in the city is to systematically and step-by-step absorb worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant youth into schools, give them cultural and scientific education, and cultivate new-type intellectual cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds. In order to solve the education problem of the children of workers in Changxindian, the Bureau of Culture and Education has decided to expand the two junior high school classes originally attached to the Central Primary School of the 18th District in Changxindian and rename it the Municipal Tenth Middle School. In addition, the two schools, Senior Technical School and Senior Commercial School, will be expanded. In addition to increasing classes, new departments will be added. The Senior Technical School plans to add an electrical engineering department; the Senior Commercial School plans to merge the original banking and accounting departments into an accounting department. If the school building problem is solved, a statistics department and a business administration department will be added. Both schools will recruit female students.

　　This summer vacation, the number of graduating classes from municipal and private senior high schools and normal and vocational schools in the city is 85, with more than 2,800 graduating students; the number of graduating classes from junior high schools and simplified normal schools is 118, with 5,600 students; and the number of graduating students from senior primary schools is 12,800. After the summer vacation, in addition to the 15 classes that have been determined to be added to the three schools of Senior Technical School, Senior Commercial School, and Beijing Normal University, general middle schools will enroll ordinary students based on the original number of graduating classes, and municipal middle schools will increase the number of classes to enroll children of workers. At the same time, private schools are also encouraged to add classes for the children of working people. The government may provide subsidies to private schools that have the conditions to add classes but have financial difficulties due to adding classes. Municipal primary schools will also add classes during the summer vacation according to the original plan.

　　[Another Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Middle Schools plan to hold entrance examinations for new students in the first year of senior and junior high school in the autumn of this year in two batches from July 15th to 25th. The examination subjects for junior high school are Chinese, arithmetic, and general knowledge; the examination subjects for senior high school are Chinese, mathematics, physics and chemistry, history and geography, natural history, and political common sense.

　　吸收工农子弟及工农干部入校学习
    京市将增设三所中学
    并扩充高工、高商等校班次
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府文教局为了解决工农子弟就学问题，及培养工农干部，技术人材和师资，决定暑假后增设普通中学和新型工农速成中学各一所，并在市立中学和市立小学增加班次。
    南城是劳动人民居住最多的地区，但没有一个市立中学，所以文教局决定在南城增设普通中学一所。在本市创办新型工农速成中学一所，是为了有计划有步骤地吸收工农干部及工农青年入学，给以文化科学教育，以培养工农出身的新型知识分子干部。为了解决长辛店工人子弟教育问题，文教局决定将原附设在长辛店第十八区中心小学的两班初中加以扩充，改为市立第十中学。此外，并扩充高工、高商两校，除增班外，并添设新科，高工拟增设电机科；高商拟将原有的银行科与会计科合并为会计科，如校舍问题解决，则另添设统计科和工商管理科。两校均招收女生。
    今年暑假，本市市私立高中和师范、职业学校毕业班数共为八十五班，毕业学生二千八百余人；初中和简易师范共毕业一百一十八班，学生五千六百余人；高级小学毕业学生共一万二千八百余人。暑假后，除高工、高商、北师三校已确定共增十五班外，一般中学则以原有之毕业班数招收普通学生，市立中学并增加班次，招收工人子弟。同时，鼓励私校也为劳动人民的子弟增设班次，有增班条件的私校因增班而经费发生困难者，政府可酌予补助。市立小学亦根据原订计划，将于暑假增班。
    【又讯】京市市立中等学校本年秋季招收高、初中一年级新生，拟于七月十五日至二十五日分两批举行入学考试。考试科目，初中为国文、算术和常识等三门；高中为国文、数学、理化、史地、博物和政治常识等六门。
