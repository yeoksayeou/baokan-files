To Dear Chairman Mao,

A Report on Production and Self-Salvation by Disaster-Stricken People in Siyang County, Northern Jiangsu

Dear Chairman Mao:

Our area is low-lying, and we have suffered from floods for five consecutive years. The floods were most severe last year. It rained continuously from May to September, with hardly any good weather. In August, the water level was high, and the banks of the Shajiang River breached, with floodwaters collapsing many houses, and some livestock drowned. As a result, the people's lives were very difficult, and seven out of ten families were eating elm bark and wild vegetables. Fortunately, the Communist Party and the People's Government have come up with many solutions for us, allocating a lot of grain from far away to help us, and leading us in production and self-salvation, helping us to engage in sideline production such as oil pressing, vermicelli making, weaving, spinning, and mat weaving, and providing us with loans to prepare for spring planting. They also organized disaster victims to dredge the river. Our lives are no longer a concern. The people all say, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us in production, we would have starved to death long ago." Chairman Mao, you are like the sun in the sky, giving us light and warmth. You lead us, take care of us, and think of all ways to solve the difficulties of the disaster. This time, you also sent an inspection team here to see us and solve our difficulties. This has strengthened our confidence in production and self-salvation. We thank you for your concern for us.

Wishing you good health!

Representative of Disaster-Stricken People from Meizhi Township, Chuancheng District, Siyang County, Northern Jiangsu, Zhang Shilan

　　写给亲爱的毛主席
    苏北泗阳县灾民报告生产自救情况亲爱的毛主席：
    我们这里地势很洼，最近五年内连续遭到水灾。去年水灾最为严重，从五月起到九月一直下雨，就没有过什么好天气。八月时，水势较大，砂礓河堤岸决口，大水冲倒了许多房屋，牲畜也有少数被淹死。因此老百姓生活很困难，十家有七家吃榆树皮和野菜过日子。幸亏共产党和人民政府给我们想了很多办法，从老远的地方拨来许多粮食救济我们，并领导我们生产自救，帮助我们搞榨油、做粉条、织布、纺纱、织席等副业生产，贷款给我们准备春种。又组织灾民去扒河。我们的生活也就不愁了。老百姓都说：“要不是毛主席领导我们搞生产，我们早就饿死了。”毛主席呀，你真像天上的太阳，给我们光明和温暖。你领导我们、照顾我们，替我们想一切办法，解决灾荒困难。这次，你又派了视察组到这里来看望我们，解决我们的困难。这使我们增强了生产自救的信心。我们感谢你对我们的关怀。
    祝你身体健康！
                      苏北泗阳县川城区美之乡灾民代表张士岚
