　　National Match Industry Conference Opens
    Efforts to Adjust Match Production and Sales

    [Xinhua News Agency, 5th] The Ministry of Light Industry, in order to resolve the current crisis of imbalanced production and sales in the match industry across various regions, convened the National Match Industry Conference on the 5th. Eighty-six representatives from industrial departments and public and private match factories in various regions, as well as related units, attended. On the first day, Minister of Light Industry Huang Yanpei delivered the opening address, followed by Vice Minister Wang Xinyuan's report on the tasks of the conference. Subsequently, representatives from various regions reported on the local match industry situation. Group discussions will begin on the second day.

    The main task of this conference is to find ways to adjust the production and sales relationship of the match industry under the principle of taking both public and private interests into consideration and providing planned support for production. The conference will realistically estimate the actual demand for matches in various regions and formulate production plans based on demand. At the same time, it is hoped that the balance between production and sales can be achieved through the control of distribution mechanisms and price policies, shifting the match industry from a situation of blind production and mutual competition to a track of planned production and unified sales. On the other hand, efforts will also be made to reduce costs and improve quality, so that manufacturing factories can obtain reasonable profits, and the vast number of people and consumers will not increase their burden. Secondly, the conference will also conduct special studies on the supply and self-sufficiency of match raw materials, the uniformity of match specifications, and quality standards, and formulate specific methods for reference and implementation in various regions, so as to lay the foundation for the future progress and development of the match industry.

　　全国火柴工业会议开幕
    设法调整火柴产销关系
    【新华社五日讯】中央轻工业部为解除目前各地火柴工业产销不调的危机，于五日召开全国火柴工业会议，出席各地工业主管部门及公私营火柴厂、各有关单位代表八十六人。第一日大会由轻工业部黄炎培部长致开会词、王新元副部长报告会议任务后，即由各区代表报告当地火柴工业情况。第二日起，开始分组讨论。
    这次会议的主要任务是在公私兼顾、有计划扶植生产的方针之下，设法调整火柴工业的产销关系。会议将切实地估计目前各地火柴的实际需要量，并根据需要量拟订生产计划；同时希望能够通过分配机构与价格政策的掌握来达到产销的平衡，把火柴工业从盲目生产、相互竞销的情况中扭转过来，走向计划生产统一销售的轨道。另一方面，并力谋减轻成本，提高品质，使制造的工厂得到合理的利润，广大人民消费者不致增加负担。其次，关于火柴原料的供应与自给，火柴规格的统一，品质的标准等，会议也将作专题研究，拟定具体的办法，提供各地参考执行，以便为火柴工业今后的进步和发展奠定基础。
