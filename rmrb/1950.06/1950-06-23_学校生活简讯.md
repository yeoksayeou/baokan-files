　　School Life Briefs
　　The Municipal No. 3 Boys' Middle School's Academic Affairs Office, in coordination with the Communist Youth League branch, held a learning inspection. Through the learning inspection, a "revision movement" was launched. The learning inspection was based on in-class life groups. Each student first did a self-examination within the group, checking which subjects they studied well and which they did not. They identified the reasons for not studying well, in order to make up for it in the "revision movement." (Yuan Heying)
　　Hebei High School invited Yu Zhenshen, the inventor of the "slide rule method," to the school on June 7th to give a lecture on the invention process of the "slide rule method," the basic principles of the "slide rule method," and general algorithms. After the lecture, Yu Zhenshen further taught the calculation methods of the "slide rule method" in detail to the school's mathematics and physics teachers and student representatives recommended by each class, so that all students could learn.

　　In order to closely coordinate family education with school education to improve students' political and cultural levels, Huabei Middle School held a parents' forum on June 11th to solicit parents' opinions and criticisms of the school. During the meeting, the homeroom teachers held individual talks with the parents of students in their classes to discuss how the school should closely cooperate with families to help students make progress faster. Service staff accompanied the parents to visit the students' assignments and conduct evaluation records, and explained them to the parents in detail. During the forum, some parents suggested: "Students have more public and sick leave, and social activities should take care of the students' health." Some parents hoped that teachers would talk more about grammar and the application of punctuation marks to students. The school attached great importance to these opinions.

　　The Affiliated High School of the Normal University held a summer epidemic prevention injection for the whole school and invited personnel from the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau to spray DDT in the classrooms, dormitories, and canteens of each department of the school on the 8th. The hygiene officers of each class are regularly responsible for supervising and inspecting cleanliness and hygiene. (Zhu Liang)
　　The Soviet-China Friendship Association branch of Hebei Provincial Normal School established a Sino-Soviet friendship service counter, purchased many magazines, pictorials, and books related to Sino-Soviet friendship, and subscribed to the Dalian Shishi Bao, which were displayed for reading. Recently, it also published a wall newspaper reflecting members' experiences after watching Soviet movies, books, and newspapers, as well as their opinions on the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, in order to enable members to further understand the Soviet Union.
