Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th. Taiyuan City is developing spare-time remedial education for workers, cadres, and citizens, and has universally established spare-time cultural remedial classes. In the city's four districts and in factories and government offices, 170 cultural remedial classes have opened, absorbing over 9,000 participants. Among these, 120 classes are for workers, with over 6,000 participants; 26 classes are for on-the-job cadres, with over 1,470 participants; and 24 classes are for citizens, shop employees, and women, with over 1,400 participants.

Workers and citizens participating in cultural remedial classes have made significant progress in their education after eight months of study. The majority of illiterate and semi-illiterate individuals have learned two to three hundred characters, and those with good results have recognized over six hundred characters and learned simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Although the on-the-job cadre cultural remedial classes have been running for a shorter period, they have also achieved significant results.

To systematically and methodically eliminate illiteracy and semi-illiteracy among adults in the city, the Taiyuan City Third Session of the First People's Representatives Conference, held in April this year, specifically passed the "Implementation Plan for Establishing On-the-Job Cadre, Worker, and Adult Remedial Schools." It was determined that, in addition to the existing 26 classes, four more cultural remedial classes would be added for on-the-job cadres, absorbing 1,500 worker and peasant cadres to participate in the study; it is planned to enroll 10,000 workers in worker classes; and 250 adult classes are planned, enrolling a total of 12,500 shop employees, citizens, suburban farmers, and women.

　　太原展开业余补习教育
    全市有一百七十个文化补习班开学
    工人、职员及市民等九千余人入班
    【新华社太原五日电】太原市展开工人、干部、市民的业余补习教育，普遍建立了业余文化补习班。全市四个区和工厂、机关已有一百七十个文化补习班开学，吸收了九千余人参加。其中工人一百二十班，参加学习者共六千余人；在职干部二十六班，参加学习者共一千四百七十余人；市民、店员、妇女等二十四班，参加学习者共一千四百余人。
    参加文化补习班学习的工人、市民等，经过八个月的学习，在文化上都有显著的进步。大部文盲、半文盲已经学会了二、三百字，成绩好的已认识六百余字，并学会了加、减、乘、除等简单算法。在职干部文化补习班开办时间虽较短，但也有很大成绩。
    为有计划有步骤地扫除全市成人中的文盲和半文盲，今年四月举行的太原市三届一次各界代表会议，特通过举办在职干部、工人、成人补习学校实施方案，确定在职干部的学习，除现有二十六个班以外，将增加四个文化补习班，吸收工农干部一千五百人参加学习；工人班计划吸收一万人参加学习；成人班二百五十班，计划吸收店员、市民、郊区农民、妇女等共一万二千五百人。
