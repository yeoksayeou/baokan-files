　　Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 24th: The Qingdao branch of the China National Grain Corporation has begun purchasing wheat. The company has allocated a total of 8 million jin of coarse grains and bean cakes, as well as a large amount of cash, to its grain branches in Jimo, Gaomi, Shuigoutou, and other places. These branches will use the cooperatives in their respective areas to exchange these goods for wheat from farmers at equivalent prices, in order to rationally adjust wheat prices and protect farmers' interests.
    After the new wheat entered the market in areas surrounding Qingdao, the price of new wheat in the Gaomi area once fell to 650 yuan per jin due to farmers' eagerness to sell. After appropriate adjustments and purchases by the grain company, it has been raised to 750 yuan per jin. The company is now working with the Qingdao State-Owned Trading Company and private merchants to prepare for the establishment of a joint wheat procurement committee to purchase wheat in a planned manner.

　　合理调整麦价保护农民利益
    青岛粮食公司开始购麦
    【新华社青岛二十四日电】中国粮食公司青岛分公司开始收购小麦。该公司已拨出粗粮和豆饼共计八百万斤以及大批现款，发给即墨、高密、水沟头等地的粮食支公司，通过各该地合作社同农民等价换购小麦，以合理调整麦价，保护农民利益。
    青岛周围各地新麦登场后，由于农民急于出售，高密一带新麦最近曾一度跌到每斤六百五十元；经粮食公司适当调剂和收购以后，已提升到每斤七百五十元。现在该公司正协同青岛市国营贸易公司和私商，筹备组织小麦联合采购委员会有计划的收购小麦。
