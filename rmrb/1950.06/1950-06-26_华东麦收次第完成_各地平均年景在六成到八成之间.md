　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: The wheat harvest in East China is nearing completion, with average yields in various provinces and regions ranging from 60% to 80% of normal years.
    The wheat harvest in Shandong Province has basically been completed, and a bumper harvest has been achieved. This year, the province's wheat field area totals more than 40 million mu, accounting for more than 40% of the province's total cultivated land area. Thanks to sufficient and timely rainfall this spring, and farmers responding to the call for more hoeing and increased fertilization, although many areas suffered from disasters such as jaundice, the province still achieved a bumper harvest, averaging about 80% of a normal year. For example, in Tancheng County, the yield per mu of the 650,000 mu of wheat fields ranged from a high of 250 jin to a low of 45 jin, with a general yield of 150 to 160 jin. Celebrating the bumper harvest, farmers said: "It is truly Chairman Mao's great blessing that we encountered such a bountiful year in the first year of the People's Republic of China."
    South of the Yangtze River, the harvest of wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, and other crops in Southern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, the suburbs of Nanjing, and Zhejiang Province has been completed. The harvest is about 60% to 70% of the normal yield. The work of transplanting rice seedlings in these provinces and regions is also nearing completion. The broad masses of farmers are now working hard to apply fertilizer, eliminate pests, and dig ditches to protect the seedlings.

　　华东麦收次第完成
    各地平均年景在六成到八成之间
    【本报讯】据新华社上海讯：华东各地麦收次第完成，各省区平均年景在六七成到八成之间。
    山东全省麦收已基本完成，并且获得丰收。该省今年麦田面积共为四千余万亩，占该省总耕地面积百分之四十以上。由于今春雨水充足、适时，农民响应多锄和增肥号召，虽有不少地区遭受黄疸等灾，但全省仍获丰收，平均约为八成年景。如郯城全县六十五万麦田每亩产量，最高二百五十斤，最低四十五斤，一般则为一百五十到一百六十斤。农民们在喜庆丰收中都说：中华人民共和国成立第一年就遇到这样丰收的年头，真是毛主席的洪福。
    长江以南的苏南、皖南、南京市郊和浙江省的麦子及油菜、蚕豆等已经全部收割完毕。收成约合常年产量六成至七成。这些省、区的麦田插秧工作亦已接近完成。广大农民现正紧张进行追肥、除虫、挖水护秧等工作。
