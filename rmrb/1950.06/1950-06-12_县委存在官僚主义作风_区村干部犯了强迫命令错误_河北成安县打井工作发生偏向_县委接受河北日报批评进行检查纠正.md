　　County Committee Exists Bureaucratic Work Style · District and Village Cadres Committed Commandism Errors
    Hebei Cheng'an County Well-Drilling Work Suffered Deviation
    County Committee Accepts Hebei Daily Criticism for Inspection and Correction
    In Cheng'an County, Handan Special District, Hebei Province, in the well-drilling work, some Party members and cadres showed a serious commandist work style and the behavior of forcibly borrowing grain and cotton from middle peasants, undermining policies; and exposed the bureaucratic work style existing in the leadership of the county Party committee and county government. Last winter, in conjunction with autumn plowing, the county drilled 773 wells. During and after spring plowing and sowing this year, another 327 wells were completed. In some villages, through the joint efforts of district and village cadres and Party branch members, the masses were led to complete the task well. However, some district and village cadres made many serious mistakes: First, when district and village Party member cadres assigned tasks to households, they did not adopt the method of in-depth publicity and patiently enlightening the masses to act consciously, but used many wrong methods to force the masses to drill wells. For example, some village cadres adopted the so-called "public discussion" method to determine the well-drilling households. If the designated households were unwilling to drill, the village cadres would force the masses to say, "This is the opinion of the 'masses,' you have to drill!" In some districts and villages that had no habit of drilling wells, Party member cadres also forced the masses to drill wells in this wrong way. Another method was direct coercion by district and village Party member cadres. For example, Yang Zizheng, deputy minister of the armed forces department of the First District, when Han Lianrun, a disabled veteran of Linlibao, opposed forced well-drilling and raised difficulties, Yang Zizheng actually said that Han was controlled by saboteurs and sent him to the district for detention overnight. He was only released after Han admitted his "mistake" and agreed to drill a well. Meng Xiu, the propaganda committee member of the Fifth District Committee, supervised well-drilling in Baitian Village. One household that did not drill was also detained by him for a day. In Dongguan South Street, First District, a voting method was used to "elect" well-drilling households. Wanglin Village, Sixth District, held a mass meeting and ordered the masses to report well-drilling; they would not be allowed to leave the meeting if they did not report. Some village Party member cadres also stipulated that the neighbors within 150 to 200 mu of land around the well site of the well-drilling households, regardless of whether they were willing to drill wells, had to pay the well-drilling fee.
    Due to forced well-drilling, many well-drilling households, even if they had savings and could afford it, said they had no way; households without savings were even more clamorous about difficulties. However, the district and village cadres were: as long as there was well-drilling, any request would be granted. Therefore, many district and village cadres did not hesitate to violate the policy of protecting private property rights and free lending, and forcibly borrowed grain and cotton from middle peasants by administrative power. Some village branches and cadres intentionally determined more households when studying well-drilling households; if some of these households were unwilling to drill wells, they would have to provide grain and cotton to "help" others. Party member cadres in six villages including Xiahetuan in the Second District forcibly borrowed 306 dou of wheat from 92 middle-peasant households using this method. Some gathered relatively wealthy middle peasants for a meeting, saying that there were difficulties in well-drilling in the village, and forcibly borrowed grain. Some village cadres and Party members first studied the lending targets themselves, using the excuse of "democracy" to have the masses "pass" it, and they had to give as much as was passed. Some villages borrowed from the middle-peasant neighbors of the well-drilling households, borrowing more from those farther away and less from those closer. The errors in the First, Second, and Third Districts were the most serious. The so-called difficulties of the well-drilling households in 70 percent of the villages in the Second and Third Districts were resolved by forcibly borrowing grain from middle peasants. The grain borrowed from the borrowed households generally had no interest and no fixed repayment period. When solving the difficulties of well-drilling households, some villages also arbitrarily encroached on undistributed property confiscated in the land reform, or apportioned cotton according to mu. Some villages even forcibly "requisitioned" bricks from each household, regardless of whether they agreed or not, and lent them out for well-drilling.
    These mistakes seriously undermined the prestige of the Party and the government among the masses, increased the ideological concerns of the broad masses of peasants, and affected the mood of production. Wang Zhixun, a middle peasant in Beizhang Village, originally planned to repair the waterwheel bucket this year to water the land, but because he was forcibly borrowed 23 jin of cotton, he became skeptical about production and getting rich, and refused to repair the waterwheel bucket.
    The main reasons for the mistakes, in addition to the low policy level and weak working ability of the district and village Party member cadres, is first of all that the county Party committee leadership did not truly clarify that the mass line is an important item of the leadership method decided by our Party Central Committee (the Central Committee's decision on leadership methods passed by the Political Bureau on June 1, 1943), and must be seriously implemented in any work; therefore, it has insufficient understanding of the harm of commandism. When planting cotton last spring, the commandist work style of the county was very serious. After the autumn cotton harvest, the peasants said they benefited from it; therefore, most district and village cadres mistakenly believed: "Forcing cotton planting in the spring was right; although the masses were dissatisfied at the beginning, they will think of the benefits of the cadres after they get the benefits." This sentiment also existed in the county Party committee, thinking that it was okay to temporarily force the masses for the long-term interests of the masses. When the provincial spring plowing inspection team raised this issue this spring, the county Party committee still believed that: there were errors, but they were not serious. Secondly, there is the serious bureaucratic work style of the county Party committee leadership. The county only assigned tasks to the districts and villages, wanted achievements, wanted figures, and paid very little attention to the way the tasks were completed. The district cadres had weak abilities and low policy levels, and the county Party committee provided them with very little specific help. The county Party committee was only satisfied with the achievement figures reported by the lower levels, and rarely conducted in-depth inspections of the work, discovered problems and solved them in time; it did not commend good methods and experiences in time, nor did it criticize bad ones in time. This naturally fostered the commandist work style of district and village cadres and Party members. In addition, the loans for grain and bricks for well-drilling this year were not issued on a large scale until the completion of sowing, which made it impossible to solve the difficulties of the masses in time, and further promoted the commandist errors of district and village Party member cadres. These problems also existed in the administrative leadership of the county government. After the Hebei Daily pointed out the errors in well-drilling in Cheng'an County, the county Party committee has sent a letter to the newspaper to examine its errors and propose corrective measures. The Handan Prefectural Committee also instructed the county on May 30 to correct the errors and restore the prestige of the Party and the government among the masses. And put forward four measures: First, strengthen the policy learning of cadres at all levels, so that cadres at all levels can clarify policy viewpoints and draw clear lines between right and wrong. Summarize work in a timely manner, disseminate experience, and correct deviations. Second, immediately solve the problem of forcibly borrowing cotton and grain from middle peasants. Convene meetings of the borrowed households to publicize the policy of free lending. Propose to the borrowed households to repay after wheat harvest. If the borrower is unable to repay, it will be postponed until autumn, and a certain amount of interest will be agreed upon by both parties. If the borrowed household does not agree, the government will use the well-drilling loan grain to repay it, as a government loan to the well-drilling household. Third, the cadres who illegally detain people should apologize to the masses. Individual unscrupulous elements should be given appropriate punishment according to the seriousness of the circumstances. Fourth, introduce good working methods to Party member cadres, and at the same time point out their shortcomings and help analyze the reasons. Prevent the tendency of cadres becoming hesitant and unable to work freely after correcting the commandist work style.

　　县委存在官僚主义作风·区村干部犯了强迫命令错误
    河北成安县打井工作发生偏向
    县委接受河北日报批评进行检查纠正
    河北省邯郸专区成安县在打井工作中一部分党员干部表现了严重的强迫命令作风及强借中农粮棉，破坏政策的行为；并暴露了该县县委和县政府领导方面存在着的官僚主义作风。该县去冬结合秋耕曾打井七百七十三眼。今年春耕播种中及播种以后，又完成三百二十七眼。其中有些村庄，由于区、村干部和支部党员的共同努力，领导群众很好地完成了任务。但是有些区、村干部则发生了不少严重错误：第一，区、村党员干部向户布置任务时，没有采取深入宣传，耐心启发群众自觉行动的方法，竟运用了许多错误方法，强迫群众打井。如有的村干部采取所谓“公议”的方法，确定打井户。被确定的户若不愿打，村干部就逼迫群众说：“这是‘群众’的意见，不打不行！”有些区、村素无打井习惯，党员干部也以这样错误方式强迫群众打井。另一种是区、村党员干部直接强迫。如一区武装部副部长杨子正，当林里堡荣誉军人韩连润反对强迫打井并提出困难时，杨子正竟说韩为破坏分子所掌握，而送区扣押一夜。直到韩承认“错误”，答应打井，才释放回去。五区区委会宣传委员孟秀，在白坦村坐催打井，有一户不打，也被他扣了一天。一区东关南街，用投票办法“选举”打井户。六区王林村召开群众大会，令群众自报打井，不报时就不让散会。还有的村子的党员干部规定了打井户井地周围一百五十亩到二百亩地以内的地邻，不管是否愿意打井，都得出打井费。
    由于强迫打井，很多打井户纵然有积蓄能打得起，也说没办法；没积蓄的户就更加吵嚷困难了。而区、村干部则是：只要打井，有求必应。因此不少区、村干部不惜违犯保障私人财权和自由借贷的政策，以行政力量强向中农借粮借棉。有些村的支部和干部在研究打井户时，有意地多确定一些户，其中有的户如不愿打井，就得出粮食棉花“帮助”别人。二区下河疃等六个村的党员干部，用这种办法强迫九十二户中农借出麦子三百零六斗。有的则召集比较富裕的中农开会，说是村中打井有困难，强借粮食，有的村干部和党员自己先研究出借粮对象，借口“民主”，由群众“通过”一下，通过多少就要出多少。有的村是从打井户的中农地邻中，远的多借，近的少借。一、二、三区错误最为严重，二、三区百分之七十村庄打井户的所谓困难，都是以强借中农粮食解决的。被借户借出的粮食，一般的没有利息，也没有一定的归还期限。有些村庄在解决打井户的困难时，还随便侵用未分配的土地改革中所没收下的财物，或者是按亩摊派出棉花。有的村甚至强“号”各户的砖，不论是否同意，一律借出打井。
    这些错误，严重地破坏了党和政府在群众中的威信，使广大农民增加了思想顾虑，影响了生产情绪。北漳村中农王志勋，本打算今年把水车斗子修好浇地，因为强借了他二十三斤棉花，以致对生产致富有了怀疑，便不肯修水车斗子了。
    产生错误的主要原因，除区、村党员干部政策水平低、工作能力薄弱外，首先是县委领导上没有真正明确群众路线是我党中央决定的领导方法（一九四三年六月一日中央政治局通过的：中央关于领导方法的决定）的重要一项，在任何工作中都必须认真执行；因而对强迫命令的危害性也就认识不足。去春种棉时，该县强迫命令的作风曾是很严重的。秋后棉花丰收，农民都说沾了光；因此大多数区、村干部就错误地认为：“春天强迫种棉是对的；开始群众虽然不满，以后得到利益便会念叨干部的好处了。”县委中也存在这种情绪，以为为着群众的长远利益，暂时强迫一下不要紧。今春省春耕检查团提出这一问题时，县委还认为：错误是有的，但是不严重。其次是县委领导上的严重的官僚主义作风。县对区、村只是布置任务，要成绩，要数目字，对完成任务的方式极不注意。区干部能力弱，政策水平低，县委对他们很少具体帮助。县委只满足于下面汇报的成绩数字，而很少深入检查工作，及时发现问题解决问题；对好的方法、经验不及时表扬，对坏的也不及时批评。这样自然助长了区、村干部、党员的强迫命令作风。加之今年打井的贷粮贷砖直到完成播种时才大批发下，使群众困难不能及时解决，更促成区、村党员干部的强迫命令错误。这些问题在县府的行政领导上也是同样存在的。成安县打井中的错误经河北日报指出后，县委已致函该报检讨错误提出纠正办法。邯郸地委也于五月三十日指示该县纠正错误，挽回党和政府在群众中的威信。并提出四项办法：一、加强各级干部的政策学习，使各级干部明确政策观点，划清是非界限。及时总结工作，传播经验，纠正偏向。二、立即解决强借中农棉粮问题。召集被借户开会宣传自由借贷政策。向借户提出麦后归还。无力归还者延至秋后，并由双方议订一定利息。如被借户不同意，则由政府用打井贷粮代还，作为政府对打井户的贷款。三、违法扣人的干部应向群众道歉。个别胡作非为的分子，应根据情节轻重，分别给予处分。四、多向党员干部介绍好的工作方法，同时指出其缺点，帮助分析原因。防止纠正强迫命令作风后，发生干部束手束脚不敢放手工作的偏向。
