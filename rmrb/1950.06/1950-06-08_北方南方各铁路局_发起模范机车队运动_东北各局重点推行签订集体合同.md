　　Northern and Southern Railway Bureaus
    Launch Model Locomotive Team Movement
    Northeast Bureaus Focus on Promoting the Signing of Collective Contracts
    [This Newspaper Reports] According to the People's Railway News, in the middle of last month, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, and the Railway Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League jointly convened a joint meeting of responsible cadres from the larger locomotive depots in the Northeast, North, and South. The meeting adopted a decision to focus on promoting the model locomotive team movement in the Southern and Northern bureaus, as well as a decision to promote collective contracts in locomotive depots. The meeting decided that the Northeast should focus on promoting the signing of collective contracts on the basis of the Iron Ox Movement. This is a sustained revolutionary competition launched to further improve locomotive quality, reduce costs, and create new quotas, on the basis of fully implementing the responsibility system.
    The Model Locomotive Team Movement is based on the experience of the Iron Ox Movement and the establishment of Iron Ox Locomotive Teams in the Northeast over the past year, combined with the general improvement in locomotive efficiency in the Northern and Southern bureaus. The scope of organization for model locomotive teams is temporarily limited to the locomotive department's chartered vehicle groups and chartered repair groups, which are divided into three types: probationary members, regular members, and core members, according to the different achievements created by the members. The Ministry of Railways, in accordance with the spirit of "consideration for both public and private interests, and more pay for more work," has also formulated measures for rewarding model locomotive teams. It stipulates that regular members will receive a bonus of 2,000 catties of millet and a collective merit citation; core members will receive a bonus of 3,000 catties of millet, a badge of honor, and a collective major merit citation; 15 percent of the bonuses received by model chartered vehicle groups will be given to the chartered repair groups, and 5 percent to the washing group.
    In order to closely integrate the production plans stipulated by the administration with the enthusiasm of the masses, the meeting decided to focus on promoting the collective contract system. According to the experience of Dalian, Fengtai, and other places, special attention should be paid to formulating various work standards suitable for the current situation before signing collective contracts. The standards should adhere to the principle of "medium-high," because if the standards are too high, they will affect the masses' confidence and enthusiasm in striving to exceed the standards; if the standards are too low, they will limit the masses' creativity in creating new quotas.

　　北方南方各铁路局
    发起模范机车队运动
    东北各局重点推行签订集体合同
    【本报讯】据人民铁道报消息：中央人民政府铁道部、中国铁路工会全国委员会、新民主主义青年团铁道工委，于上月中旬联合召集东北、北方、南方各较大机务段的行政、工会、青年团负责干部开联席会议。会上通过在南方、北方各局重点推行模范机车队运动的决定，及机务段推行集体合同的决定。会上决定，东北应在铁牛运动的基础上，重点推行签订集体合同。这是在全面贯彻负责制的基础上，为进一步提高机车质量，减低成本，创造新定额而发起的持久性的革命竞赛。
    模范机车队运动，是以东北一年来开展铁牛运动，建立铁牛机车队的经验，结合北方、南方各局机务工作效率普遍提高的情况而提出的。模范机车队的组织范围，暂限于机务部门的包车组与包修组，根据队员所创造的不同成绩，分为预备队员、正式队员及基干队员三种。铁道部根据“公私兼顾，多劳多得”的精神，并制订了模范机车队奖励办法。规定正式队员奖金为二千斤小米，集体记功一次；基干队员奖金为三千斤小米，并奖光荣牌一个，集体记大功一次；模范包车组所得奖金，百分之十五给包修组，百分之五给洗罐组。
    为了把行政上规定的生产计划和群众的积极性密切结合起来，会议决定重点推行集体合同制度。根据大连、丰台等地的经验，签订集体合同之前，应该特别注意制定适合于目前情况的各种工作标准。标准应掌握“中等偏高”的原则，因为如果标准过高，会影响群众争取超过标准的信心和积极性；标准过低，则会限制群众对新定额的创造性。
