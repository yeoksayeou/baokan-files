　　People's Insurance Company of China
    Launches Group Fire Insurance for Employees
    [Report from this newspaper] The People's Insurance Company of China recently launched group fire insurance for employees to protect the interests of the working class. The measures are as follows: (1) The insurance premium, regardless of the building structure and fire prevention conditions, is uniformly charged at 0.2% of the insured amount every six months (in the past, if the employees' housing was poorly constructed, they had to pay a higher premium). The insured amount is divided into two categories: calculated in Renminbi, it is divided into four types: 20 million yuan, 15 million yuan, 10 million yuan, and 5 million yuan; calculated in real units, it is divided into four types: 3,000 units, 2,000 units, 1,000 units, and 500 units. Employees can freely choose to insure. If the insured amount is below 5 million yuan or 500 units, it can also be insured with the consent of the insurance company. (2) If a fire occurs after insurance and losses are incurred, the insured can receive full compensation for actual losses within the insured amount. This is different from the general proportional compensation method for fire insurance (proportional compensation means that when the insured goods suffer losses, if the actual total value of all insured goods exceeds the insured amount, the compensation must be paid based on the ratio of the insured amount to the actual total value according to the actual losses. That is, if the insured amount is not enough for the actual total value of the property, full compensation will not be obtained if compensation occurs). (3) The procedures are simple. When insuring, the employee group only needs to fill out a fixed-form insurance list, stating the insured's name, address, and insured amount; the insurance premium is also remitted by the group within seven days of the insurance start date, which indeed provides great convenience to the employees.

　　中国人民保险公司
    开办职工团体火灾保险
    【本报讯】中国人民保险公司为照顾工人阶级的利益最近特开办职工团体火灾保险。其办法是：（一）保险费，不分房屋建筑及防火条件好坏等不同情况，每半年一律按保险金额的千分之二收费（过去如职工们的住屋建筑不好，就须缴付较多的保险费）。保险金额分为二类：以人民币计算的，分为二千万元、一千五百万元、一千万元和五百万元四种；以折实单位计算的，分为三千单位、二千单位、一千单位和五百单位四种。都可以由职工自由选择投保。如果保险金额在五百万元或五百单位以下的，经保险公司同意后，也可投保。（二）投保后如遇火灾，遭受损失，被保险人可以在保险金额范围内，按实际损失得到十足的赔款。这是不同于一般火险比例赔偿办法的（比例赔偿就是当保险物品遭遇损失时，全部保品实际总值，如超过保险金额，其赔款须就实际损失，按照保险金额与实际总值的比例计算付给。也就是保险金额如不够财产实际总值，如发生赔款就得不到十足的赔款）。（三）手续简便，投保时只须由职工团体填写定式保险清单一份，说明被保险人姓名、住所地址和保险金额等项即可；保险费也由团体在起保日七天内汇缴，确实给予职工们很大的便利。
