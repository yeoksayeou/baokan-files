　　U.S. Imperialist Vietnam Invasion Plan Executor
    Blum Arrives in Saigon

    [Xinhua News Agency, 14th] Blum, the executor of the American expansion plan in Vietnam, recently arrived in Saigon. In the name of the head of the American "Special Economic Mission," he is preparing to stay in the areas controlled by the Vietnamese puppet government for a long time in order to directly control the French colonialists and the Bảo Đại puppet government. According to a report by the United Press, Blum made a hypocritical statement in Saigon on the 6th of this month. After announcing that the total amount of the first year's "economic aid" from the United States to Vietnam would be 23 million US dollars, he said: This "aid" from the United States to Indochina is not to be used against the Vietnamese people, but "will only be used for civilian purposes"; at the same time, it is "not to interfere with the existing relations between France and these countries." However, according to a commentary by "Voice of Vietnam" radio station cited by the Vietnam News Agency on the 10th: "Suppressing the Indochinese national liberation movement, and gradually excluding the French colonialists, so as to achieve its goal of monopolizing the natural resources of Indochina, this is the direct and long-term purpose of the American imperialists' interference in Indochina; this purpose has been so clearly revealed in Blum's statement that no Indochinese people will be deceived by the diplomatic rhetoric of this Wall Street agent." The commentary continued: "The people of Indochina, like all other people in Southeast Asia, will fight until victory comes, in order to destroy the aggressive plans of French colonialism and international imperialism."

　　美帝侵越计划执行人
    布鲁姆抵西贡
    【新华社十四日讯】美国对越南扩张计划的执行人布鲁姆已于最近抵西贡，他以美国“特别经济使团”团长的名义，准备长期留在越南傀儡政府控制地区，以直接控制法国殖民者和保大傀儡政府。据合众社讯，本月六日，布鲁姆在西贡发表了一个伪善的声明。他在宣布美国给越南的第一年“经济援助”总额将为二千三百万美元之后说：美国对印度支那的这种“援助”，不是用来反对越南人民，而“将仅用于民事方面”；同时，“也不是来干与法国在这些国家间现存的关系”。但据越南通讯社十日引“越南之声”广播电台的评论说：“镇压印度支那民族解放运动，并逐渐排斥法国殖民者，从而达到其独占印度支那自然资源的目的，这便是美帝国主义者干涉印度支那的直接而长远的目的；这种目的已在布鲁姆的声明里非常明显地泄漏出来，以致没有一个印度支那人民会为这位华尔街代理人的外交辞令所蒙蔽。”评论继称：“印度支那的人民也像东南亚所有的其他人民一样，将要斗争到胜利的到来为止，以便摧毁法国殖民主义和国际帝国主义的侵略计划。”
