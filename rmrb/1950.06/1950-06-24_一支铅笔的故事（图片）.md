    Yu Zhen
    (Cartoon) (Three)
    (Nine) Little Stone rushed in cursing, accusing me of stealing his pencil.
    (Ten) I said, "Though poor, my integrity is not cheap." I was so angry that I hit him back.
    (Eleven) After hitting the child, his mother came out, shouting "The world is turned upside down!" The head manager also picked up a stick and chased after me.

    （十一）打了孩子出来了他的娘，连喊着“反了天”。大掌柜也拿起棍子在后边追我。
