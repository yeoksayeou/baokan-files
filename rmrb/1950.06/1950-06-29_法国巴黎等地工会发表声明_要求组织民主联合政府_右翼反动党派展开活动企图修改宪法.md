Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 27th: TASS reports that French President Auriol has been negotiating with leaders of various political parties for three days, but has so far failed to appoint anyone to form a government. Auriol had wanted to entrust this task to Guy Mollet of the Radical Socialist Party, who had previously presided over the government. However, Mollet replied that in the current situation, he could only undertake a mission of "information gathering," that is, to hold preliminary talks on the possibility of the parties reaching an agreement. Only after these negotiations could Mollet answer whether he agreed to form a government.

At the same time, political leaders and political organizations are issuing statements clarifying their positions. On the one hand, the reactionary camp in France is very active. De Gaulle, who leads the so-called "Rally of the French People," delivered a speech demanding "separation of powers," that is, granting the President of the Republic dictatorial powers. According to him, the government should not be responsible to the parliament, but only to the head of state. Former Minister of Justice Meyer, a member of the Radical Socialist Party, also delivered a speech, putting forward his party's demands for amending the constitution and the electoral law. The Radical Socialist Party is demanding the implementation of the reactionary "majority" voting system. The right-wing groups can use this system to deprive the mass organizations of the working people, especially the Communist Party, of their representation in parliament.

On the other hand, the movement of the working people demanding the establishment of a democratic coalition government has been strengthened domestically. This demand has been supported by the Communist Party and other progressive groups. The Trade Union Federation of Seine-Maritime, the Trade Union Federation of the Paris region, and several other groups have issued statements on this matter.

　　法国巴黎等地工会发表声明
    要求组织民主联合政府
    右翼反动党派展开活动企图修改宪法
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十七日讯：法总统阿里奥尔与各政党领袖进行谈判已有三天之久，但迄今仍未能任命任何人组织政府。阿里奥尔曾想把这项任务交给以前曾经主持过政府的激进社会党的葛义。然而，葛义回答说，他在目前的形势之下只能负起“通报”的使命，就是说，就各党达成协议的可能性举行初步谈判。只有在这些谈判之后，葛义才能答复他是否同意组成政府。
    同时，各政治领袖和政治组织都在发表声明，阐明他们的立场。一方面是法国的反动阵营大为活跃。领导着所谓“法兰西人民联盟”的戴高乐曾发表演说，要求“分权”，也即赋予共和国总统以独裁的权力。根据他的意见，政府不需要对议会负责，而只是对国家的元首负责。前司法部长激进社会党员迈耶也发表演说，提出他的党对于修改宪法与选举法的要求。激进社会党要求实行反动的“多数”投票制。右翼集团利用这个制度就可以剥夺劳动人民的群众组织、首先是共产党在议会中的代表权。
    另一方面，劳动人民要求建立民主联合政府的运动，已在国内增强起来。这个要求获得了共产党和其他进步团体的支持。下塞纳省工会联合会，巴黎区工会联合会以及若干其他团体，均曾就此事发表声明。
