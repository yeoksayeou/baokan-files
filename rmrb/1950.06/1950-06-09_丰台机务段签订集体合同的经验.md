The Fengtai Locomotive Depot had already extensively mobilized its workers and initiated rationalization proposals before signing the collective contract at the end of April this year. The depot had accumulated 380,000 kilometers of safe running and produced six model locomotives. Through mass discussions, the trade union had already formulated a production plan for the entire year of 1950. Therefore, the conditions for signing the collective contract were ripe.

However, there were still many difficulties severely hindering the signing of the collective contract. For example, the planning of production management lacked sufficient rigor, and monthly, quarterly, and annual production targets were not fixed. There was a shortage of mechanical equipment that had not been resolved for a long time, which affected the establishment of normal work order and inevitably led to overtime work. The staffing problem was not properly resolved, with 78 workers being transferred to various locations for training, which affected the calculation of labor costs. The supply of materials was also not timely.

We reported these difficulties to the Tianjin Railway Bureau. The responsible comrades of the bureau proposed a production plan, initially resolved the difficulties with mechanical equipment, determined the staffing plan, and guaranteed the supply of materials. This prepared all the basic conditions for signing the contract. Therefore, grasping favorable conditions, while facing difficulties squarely, maintaining confidence, and fighting against all ideological and material obstacles is a prerequisite for signing a collective contract.

　　Extensive Publicity and Mobilization, In-Depth Discussion

When we confirmed the intention to sign the collective contract, we prepared in two aspects. One aspect was to conduct extensive publicity among cadres and the masses. The other aspect was to submit the administratively stipulated production plan, the production goals determined by the trade union, and the draft collective contract drafted by both the administration and the trade union to the workers for repeated item-by-item discussion after obtaining the approval of the higher authorities (Tianjin Railway Bureau). Through full discussion, the masses understood the content of the draft and were able to supplement and revise its provisions. Therefore, the process of signing the collective contract was also a process of mobilizing and organizing workers. However, in this process, it is necessary to grasp the possible left or right deviations: The left manifests as large plans, high standards, and few rewards, forming a compulsion of a few activists on backward masses; the right manifests as the staff's pure welfare point of view, lowering the achievable work standards, exaggerating objective defects such as mechanical equipment, and accommodating backward sentiments, becoming tailism. Therefore, signing a collective contract is also a combination of in-depth investigation and research and persuasive mobilization. If the publicity and education work is not in-depth, and each clause in the contract cannot be accepted by all workers, the contract will often become a mere formality or change the original plan. Of course, the inspection work during the implementation process is also very important.

　　Mastering the Principle of "Taking into Account Both Public and Private Interests, Rewarding Diligence"

Signing a collective contract must grasp the principle of "taking into account both public and private interests, rewarding diligence," and clearly stipulate the production plan, standards, and reward methods. Regarding the plan and standards, the principle of "medium-high" should be mastered. Standards that are too high will dampen the masses' confidence and enthusiasm in striving to exceed them; standards that are too low will limit the masses' creativity in setting new quotas. After the standards are set, the reward methods must be clearly stipulated. Without reward methods, there will be a lack of attraction to motivate workers to strive to exceed the plan. On the other hand, labor protection, welfare undertakings, and cultural and educational facilities that workers can possibly achieve must also be clearly stipulated in the contract clauses as much as possible, even if they are very minor, they have their political significance.

In addition, a grand ceremony should be held when signing the collective contract. The signing ceremony of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot was attended by Chairman Li of the National Railway Trade Union, responsible administrative officials from higher levels, and responsible comrades from various districts in Fengtai. After such a ceremony, the sense of responsibility of both the administration and the workers for the contract was further enhanced.

It should be especially pointed out that signing the collective contract must be combined with strengthening democratic management. The Fengtai Locomotive Depot re-elected the trade union, the management committee, and the workers' representative assembly during the signing of the collective contract. Through the signing of the collective contract, democratic management will be strengthened. Experience has proven that collective contracts can be signed in places where workers have basically been organized and democratic management has been initially implemented.

Since the Fengtai Locomotive Depot began preparing and signing the collective contract, significant results have been achieved in April and May: the scope of work of the trade union and the administration has been clarified, a normal production order has been established, the phenomenon of overtime work has been basically overcome, relations in various aspects have tended to normalize, and production efficiency has generally exceeded the bureau's set standards. It is expected that the tasks stipulated in the contract will be completed and exceeded at the end of three months.

Finally, it must also be pointed out that the collective contract of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot has shortcomings, especially regarding the "debt repayment," that is, the issue of compensation is not stipulated. Therefore, it may cause workers to develop an insufficiently serious attitude. Secondly, some standards are set inappropriately, leading to repeated requests for modification. There are also many items that should be specific but are not, such as "strengthening lighting equipment in various workplaces: four floodlights in the depot, two floodlights on the west turntable, four floodlights on the new and old lines, and four lighting lamps on the coal platform." These are only generally mentioned in the contract as "lighting equipment to be determined separately." In particular, indirect workers were not included in the contract, and their reaction was great. These experiences are worth studying and referencing in various places.

### 丰台机务段签订集体合同的经验

　　丰台机务段签订集体合同的经验
    岳志坚
    丰台机务段在今年四月底签订集体合同以前，工人群众已有相当发动，合理化建议已广泛开展；全段累积安全走行公里已经达到三八万公里，并出现了六台模范机车；通过群众讨论，工会已订出了一九五○年全年生产奋斗计划。因此，签订集体合同的条件已经成熟。
    但是，还有很多困难，严重地阻碍着集体合同的签订。例如：生产管理的计划性不够严密，月别、季别和年度的生产任务没有固定。机械设备不足，且长期未得解决，因而影响建立正常的工作秩序，不可避免地产生加班加点。定员问题没有适当解决，调往各地受训的工人就有七十八名，影响到人工成本的计算。材料的供给也不及时。
    我们向天津铁路局反映了这些困难。路局负责同志提出了生产计划，初步解决了机器设备上的困难；确定了定员编制；保证了材料的供给。这样，就准备了签订合同的一切基本条件。所以，掌握有利的条件，同时正视困难，坚定信心，和一切思想上、物质上的障碍作斗争，是签订集体合同的先决条件。 　　 广泛进行宣传发动深入讨论
    当我们肯定要签订集体合同时，从两方面进行了准备工作，一方面是在干部、群众中进行广泛的宣传；另一方面，把行政上规定的生产计划，工会确定的生产奋斗目标，行政、工会双方所草的集体合同草案，于取得上级（天津铁路局）的同意后，交给工人逐条反复的讨论。经过充分的讨论，群众就体会了草案的内容，并能补充和修正这个草案的条款。因此签订集体合同的过程，也就是发动与组织工人的过程。但在这一过程中要掌握可能发生的或左或右的偏向：左的表现形式为计划大，标准高，奖励少，形成少数积极分子对落后群众的强迫；右的表现形式为工作人员单纯的福利观点，降低可能达到的工作标准，夸大机械设备等客观的缺陷，迁就落后情绪，成为尾巴主义。所以签订集体合同也是一种深入的调查研究和说服动员相结合的工作，宣传教育工作不深入，合同中的每一条文不能为全体工人所接受，往往会使合同流于形式或改变原来计划。当然执行过程中的检查工作也甚为重要。 　　掌握“公私兼顾多劳多得”原则
    签订集体合同，必须掌握“公私兼顾、多劳多得”的原则，明确的规定出生产计划、标准和奖励办法。关于计划和标准，应该掌握“中等偏高”的原则。标准过高，会打击群众争取超过的信心和积极性；过低就限制了群众对新定额的创造性，标准制定以后，必须明确规定奖励办法。如果没有奖励办法，就会缺乏一种吸引力来发挥工人争取超过计划的积极性。另一方面对工人可能办到的劳动保护、福利事业和文化教育等设施，也必须尽可能在合同条文上明确规定，那怕是很细微的亦有它的政治意义。
    此外，签订集体合同时，要举行隆重的仪式。丰台机务段在签订集体合同的大会上，有全国铁路工会李主席，上级行政负责人及丰台地区各负责同志参加，经过了这样的仪式，行政与工人双方对合同的责任心更加提高了。
    特别应指出的，签订集体合同必须和加强管理民主化相结合，丰台机务段在签订集体合同中改选了工会、管委会和职工代表会。通过集体合同的签订，将会加强管理民主化。经验证明：只要工人已基本上组织起来，管理民主化已经初步实行的地方，就可以签订集体合同。
    丰台机务段自酝酿和签订集体合同以来，四、五月份工作已收到显著效果：明确了工会与行政的工作范围，正常的生产秩序已建立，加班加点现象基本克服，各方面关系趋于正常，生产效率普遍超过局定标准。预计在三个月终了时，合同上规定的任务一定会完成超过的。
    最后，还必须指出：丰台机务段的集体合同是有缺点的，尤其是关于“欠账还账”，即赔偿的问题没有规定。因此就有可能使工人产生不够认真的态度。其次就是有些标准定得不恰当，以致几次提出来修改。还有很多应当具体的项目没有具体，如“加强各职场照明设备：库内投光灯四个，西转盘投光灯两个，新老线投光灯四个，煤台照明灯四个”，这些在合同上仅笼统提出“照明设备另定之”。特别是间接工没有订上，他们的反映很大。这些经验值得各地研究参考。
