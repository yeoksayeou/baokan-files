　　Do you still need us to promote the People's Daily? Editor:
    I am the person in charge of the Yixian distribution point of the People's Daily. I have been promoting the People's Daily in Yixian for more than a year. After hard work, the number of subscriptions has grown to more than 50 copies. Since the merger of postal delivery and distribution in late March this year, the post office has often promoted to our subscribers: "The distribution point cannot exist for a long time. The post office is formal. Please subscribe to the newspaper from the post office." As a result, the newspapers we distributed were reduced to eight copies. Later, after our hard work, it developed to 21 copies. Who knew that on May 25, we received a notice from them (oral) saying that the newspapers of all distribution points would be cancelled in June. At that time, we asked them on what basis, and they said that there were orders within the bureau, etc. On May 26, the People's Daily published an important notice from the General Post Office. After reading it, we took it to the Yixian Post Office to discuss it. Unexpectedly, the director said: "The content of the newspaper does not work. We are based on the order of the Jin County Administration Bureau. The People's Daily is in Beijing, and the Northeast is different from Beijing. The Northeast is special." We were helpless. On June 4, we went to the post office to ask again. According to the post office, we still have to wait a few days. Editor, please, do you still need us to promote the People's Daily? Is the important notice of the General Post Office valid in the Northeast? Now the post office only distributes more than 20 copies. According to the original number, there are still more than 30 copies missing. If we are still allowed to distribute the newspapers, the newspapers can still maintain the original number. If you really don't want us to distribute the newspapers, we will be unemployed. Can your newspaper introduce us to a job to maintain our lives? Please reply.

    Editor's note: If the feedback from the Yixian distribution point of this newspaper is true, then the Yixian Post Office has a serious bias in the newspaper distribution policy. It is hoped that the Northeast Postal Administration and the Jin County Postal Administration will investigate this and make a public reply in this newspaper.

### 还要我们推销人民日报吗？

　　还要我们推销人民日报吗？编辑同志：
    我是人民日报义县代销处的负责人，在义县推销人民日报已经一年多了，经过努力推销，报数发展到五十多份。自今年三月下旬邮发合一以后，邮局经常对我们的订户宣传：“代销处不能长期存在，邮局是正规化的，请向邮局订报。”结果使我们经销的报纸减少到八份。后来经过我们努力推销，又发展到了二十一份。谁知五月二十五日得到他们通知（口头的），说六月份全部取消代销处的报纸。当时我们问他们根据什么，他们说局内有命令等等。五月二十六日人民日报登载了邮政总局的重要通知，我们看了，便拿到义县邮局去商量，不料局长说：“报纸所载不起作用，我们是根据锦县管理局的命令的。人民日报是在北京，东北与北京不同，东北是特殊的。”我们无可奈何了。六月四日又到邮局去问，据邮局谈仍得等几天再说。请问编辑同志，到底要不要我们推销人民日报了？邮政总局的重要通知，在东北是否有效？现在邮局代销数量仅二十余份，按原有数额尚差三十余份，如果仍归我们代销的话，报纸仍能保持原来数额。如果当真不要我们代销报纸了，我们只有失业。贵报能否给我们介绍个工作以维持生活？请示复。

                                    六月四日
    编者按：本报义县代销处的反映，如果属实，则义县邮局在报纸发行政策上有严重的偏向。望东北邮政管理局及锦县邮政管理局对此加以调查，并在本报公开作复。
