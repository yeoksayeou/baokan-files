Contribution of Mass X-ray Screening to Tuberculosis Prevention and Control
    Hu Shuqi

    The purpose of using mass X-ray screening is to examine early-stage lung diseases at the lowest cost and to detect patients who are unknowingly spreading tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is completely different from various climate-restricted diseases, such as malaria. Whether in the frigid zone or the tropics, the speed of transmission of tuberculosis bacteria is equally rapid. Moreover, the early symptoms of tuberculosis are not very significant and are extremely difficult to detect. Therefore, more young people die from tuberculosis than from any other disease.

    For many years, the only way to detect early tuberculosis was to use X-rays to photograph the lungs. At the same time, X-ray photography is also the best way to detect tuberculosis carriers. These carriers are people with low-grade chronic lung diseases who feel very healthy even though there are already large numbers of tubercle bacilli inside their bodies. If we can use X-rays to identify these two types of people, then we can easily and effectively treat the early stages of tuberculosis and guide the chronic type to implement simple hygiene and prevention methods to prevent the tuberculosis bacteria inside their bodies from infecting others. As a result, we have hope of finally eradicating this terrible tuberculosis disease.

    We all know that X-rays themselves are invisible. When X-rays are reflected on a specially made screen, they emit bright fluorescence. At this time, if someone stands behind the screen, their lungs will appear as a green light lung pattern on the screen. However, this green light is not very bright and cannot be photographed with an ordinary camera. This difficulty has been completely resolved in the past by two new inventions. One is a film with extremely sensitive photosensitivity, and the other is a lens that can collect every ray of light.

    Originally, the green light lung pattern appearing on the screen could be used for inspection. This would save the film and shooting procedures, and the cost could be reduced a lot. However, when this method is used in collective lung examinations, several serious drawbacks will inevitably occur. For example, the inspector's work is very busy and there is a risk of being infected. Also, when he speeds up his work, he often neglects many extremely important but not very obvious signs. Furthermore, this simplified and time-saving method lacks permanent records. Therefore, X-ray screening is undoubtedly best done with photographs.

    However, an ordinary X-ray photograph of the lungs is seventeen inches long and fourteen inches wide. Taking and developing such a large photograph costs a lot of materials and time, and it is also very inconvenient to store. Therefore, it is relatively difficult in practice to take tens of millions of such photos to universally expand the work of tuberculosis prevention and treatment. However, mass X-ray screening solves all these problems. From many perspectives, this is the only perfect method. The so-called "mass X-ray screening" is the application of a fluorescent screen to photograph miniature X-ray photos. The equipment used is roughly similar to the camera used to shoot movies.

    Various sophisticated components required for mass X-ray screening, such as precisely matched rotating anode radiation tubes, highly luminous large-aperture lenses, and finely sensitive high-speed films, have appeared one after another. At the same time, in terms of shooting technology, due to diligent research results and the achievements of aerial photography, there have also been special improvements.

    The mechanical part of the miniature X-ray camera is exactly the same as an ordinary miniature camera. The only difference is that it is additionally equipped with a fluorescent screen and a set of standard X-ray equipment. At the same time, its entire structure is extremely precise and can be easily moved from one place to another. The latest type of Dm3A miniature X-ray camera is very simple. However, it can take a thousand miniature X-ray photos every day, and each photo is only the size of a postage stamp.

    Mass X-ray screening is handled by district in all countries where it is used. Each mobile photography unit proceeds to each department in each district in order. When it moves into a factory, barracks, or school, all workers, soldiers, and students are notified separately to come and take X-ray photos according to the time specified in the notice. In fact, the procedure for taking X-ray photos is very simple. Everyone who needs to be photographed walks into the photography room and fills in their name and number on a card. Then they stand in front of the camera, press their chest tightly against a small black screen, and hand their card to the photographer. The photographer puts the card into the card slot of the camera and then tells him to take a deep breath, pause for a moment, and the camera will take a good X-ray photo of the chest. At the same time as taking the X-ray photo, the number on the card is also photographed. Therefore, the photos of each person will never be wrong. Also, when the card is put into the card slot, it also forms a section of the camera circuit. Therefore, the number of each photo will never be omitted. The whole procedure is carried out in sunlight. Each person stands in the photography room for no more than two or three minutes. In fact, the time spent filling out the card is even longer than the time spent taking the photo. Whenever a person's photo is taken, the technician develops the film and then projects it onto a cloth screen in the darkroom. This is the same as a movie screen, but smaller. The person who checks the photos is a doctor who is proficient in pulmonology and also skilled in X-ray photography. He sits in front of the screen, with a clerk beside him, holding a thousand people's cards. The order of the cards corresponds to the order of the photos. When each photo is projected on the cloth screen, the doctor takes a look and then says whether it is normal or suspicious. The clerk immediately records his words on the card. It only takes the doctor about four hours to examine a thousand photos.

    If fifty people out of the thousand examined are suspicious, the doctor will send each of them another notice, asking them to come back and retake large X-ray photos for more detailed examination. Everyone else is also issued a notice telling them that their lungs are normal. However, not all of the fifty people who return have lung disease. Perhaps in a few cases, due to the film being too sensitive, a bit of dust forms a terrible black shadow. This defect can occur even if it is carried out in an air-conditioned room. In other cases, perhaps a suspicious black shadow is produced because there is an old mark on the lung, or there are some slight abnormalities on the heart. But if four to five of these fifty people do have tuberculosis and need treatment; another four may also have tuberculosis, but do not need treatment and can be allowed to heal automatically. They can get extra food and reduce their working hours. They come back to take X-ray photos every three or six months until their photos are completely normal. Even those who need treatment do not have to leave their jobs for long, because lung disease is often easy to treat in the early stages. The doctor must first examine their physical condition, study their own and family history, living environment, and occupation, before deciding on a treatment plan. Many can recover completely with a short period of rest, while others can regain their health simply by changing jobs or changing their environment.

    Due to the prevalence and alarming speed of transmission of tuberculosis bacteria, tuberculosis has always been a major problem in the medical field. But now, due to the adoption of mass X-ray screening, this terrible infectious disease may be eradicated from humans in the near future and will no longer be threatened by it.

　　集团Ｘ光照相对于防治肺结核的贡献
    胡树?
    采用集团Ｘ光照相的目的，是为了以最便宜的费用，来检查初期的肺病，和发现在不知不觉中传布肺结核的病人。肺结核与各种受气候限制的病症，例如疟疾等，是完全不同的。结核菌无论是在寒带，或者是在热带，它的传播的速度，是同样的迅速。而且结核病的初期的症状，并不十分显著，极难发现。因此患肺结核而死的青年，要比任何的疾病为多。
    许多年来，唯一能发现初期肺结核的方法，便是利用Ｘ光拍摄肺部的照相。同时，Ｘ光照相也是侦察肺结核媒介最好的方法。这些媒介是生有低级慢性肺病的人，虽然他们身体内部已经存在着大量的结核杆菌，但是他们自己还觉得很是健康。假使我们能够用Ｘ光查出这两类型的人来，那末，我们就可以很简便的，而且有效的去治疗初期的一类的肺结核症，同时指导那慢性的一类，实行简单的卫生预防法，以防止他们身体内部的肺结核菌传染别人。结果我们就有了希望，以达到最后根绝这可怕的肺结核病。
    我们都知道，Ｘ光本身是看不见的。当Ｘ光反射在某种特制的幕上的时候，它便发出明亮的萤光。此时如果有人站在幕后，他的肺部就在幕上出现为绿光的肺型。但是这绿光并不十分的明亮，不能够用普通的照相机来拍摄照片。这一个困难，过去由于两次新的发明，将它完全解决了。其一为感光极度灵敏的软片，其二为能收集每条光线的透镜。
    本来，幕上出现的绿光肺型，即可以供检验之用。如此可省去软片和拍摄的手续，费用可以因此减省不少。但是当此法用在集体检查肺部的时候，便不免要发生几项严重的弊端。如检查员的工作非常忙碌而且有被传染的危险。又如当他加速工作时，往往会疏忽许多极重要，而又不甚明显的象征。还有，这一种简化省事的办法，缺少永久的记录。所以集团Ｘ光照相的检查，无疑地是用照片为最好。
    但是一张普通肺部的Ｘ光照相，有十七英寸长，十四英寸宽。拍摄和显影这样大小的一张照相，既要花费大量的材料，还要花费许多的时间，而且存储起来，也极不方便。所以，要拍摄千万张这样的照片，以普遍的展开防痨和治痨的工作，在事实上是比较困难的事。可是集团Ｘ光照相，却将这一切难题，统统都解决了。从许多方面看来，这都是唯一完满的方法。所谓“集团Ｘ光照相”，就是应用萤光幕来拍摄缩影的Ｘ光照相。其所用的机件，和拍摄电影片的开麦拉大致相似。
    集团Ｘ光照相所需要的各种精良的机件，例如配光精密的旋转式阳极放射管，高度放光幕阔孔透镜，以及精细感光的高速软片，都已相继出现。同时，在拍摄的技术方面，由于努力研究的结果，以及航空摄影的成就，也有了特殊的改进。
    缩影放射线照相机的机械部分，和普通缩影照相机完全相同。所不同的，不过是额外的装着一幅萤光幕，和一副标准的Ｘ光器具而已。同时，其全部结构，异常的精密，很容易从这一处移到另一处去。最新式的一种Ｄｍ３Ａ式的缩影放射线照相机，非常简单。可是它每天能拍摄一千张的缩影Ｘ光照片，而每张照片都只有邮票那样大。
    集团Ｘ光照相，在所有采用的各个国家，都是分区办理的。每架流动的摄影装置，依着次序在每一区的各部门进行。当它移进一个工厂、兵营或学校时，所有的工人、兵士和学生，都分别的收到通知，按照通知上规定的时间，前来拍摄Ｘ光照片。实际上，拍摄Ｘ光照片的手续是很简便的。每一个需要拍摄的人，走进照相室后，把他的名字和号码填上一张卡片，于是他站到照相机的前面，把胸部紧贴一幅小的黑幕，同时向摄影员交出他的卡片，摄影员便将卡片放进照相机的卡缝里，然后叫他深深的吸进一口气，稍停片刻，照相机即把胸部的Ｘ光照片拍好。在这拍摄Ｘ光照片的同时，也把卡片上的号码拍进去。因此各人的照片决不会有错误的。还有，当卡片放入卡缝以后，也形成照相机电路的一段。每张照相的号码，因此也决不会有遗漏。全部手续在阳光下进行。每个人站在摄影室的时间，并不超过两三分钟。事实上，填卡片所花费的时间，还比拍摄照片的时间长。每当拍好一个人的照片以后，技术员便把软片显影，随后映射到暗室里的一幅布幕上去。这和电影的银幕相同，不过小些。检查照片的是一位精于肺科，而又熟练Ｘ光照相的医生。他坐在幕前，身旁是一位书记员，拿着一千人的卡片。卡片的先后次序，和照相的先后次序相符合。当每张照片映在布幕上的时候，医生便看一下，随后说出这是正常的，还是可疑的。书记员立刻把他的话记录在卡片上。医生每检查一千张照片，只费时约四小时。
    在检验的一千人之中如果有五十人是可疑的，医生即向他们每人再发一封通知，请他们回来重拍大的Ｘ光的照片，以备作更详细的检查。其余的人们，也都再发出通知，告诉他们的肺部是正常的。可是所有回来的五十人中，并不全部有肺病，其中有几位的照片，也许是为了软片感光过于敏锐的关系，一点灰尘就形成了一块可怕的黑影，即使在空气调节的房间内进行，也会发生这种弊病。另有几种情形，也许是为了肺上有个旧的痕迹，或者是心脏上有一些轻微的变态，而产生可疑的黑影。但是如在这五十人中，有四个人到五个人的确是生有肺结核病的，需要治疗；另有四人，也许也患有肺结核病，不过不需要治疗，可任其自动痊愈。他们可以取得额外的食物，同时减少他们的工作时间。他们每隔三个月或六个月，回来拍摄Ｘ光照片一次，一直到他们的照片完全正常为止。甚至那些需要治疗的人，也不必离职很久，因为肺病在初期，常常是很容易医治的。医生必须先检查他们的体格，研究他们自身和家庭的历史、生活环境，以及职业等，然后再行决定处理的方法。有许多只要短时期的休养便能够完全痊愈，另有些只要改调职业，或者变换环境，便能够恢复健康。
    由于结核杆菌的普遍性和惊人的传布速度，肺结核病一直是医学界的一大难题。但是现在由于集团Ｘ光照相的采用，这一个可怕的传染病，不久的将来，可能根绝于人类，而不再受到它的威胁。
