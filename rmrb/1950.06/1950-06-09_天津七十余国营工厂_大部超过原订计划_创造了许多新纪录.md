Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 2nd. Since the launch of the production competition campaign in early May, more than 60,000 employees in over 70 state-owned and public factories in Tianjin have mostly completed or exceeded their May production plans, creating many new records. The construction of the new open-hearth furnace at the Tianjin Steel Plant exceeded the original plan by 65% in May, and the output of steel wire rope exceeded the original plan by 110%. The six cotton spinning mills and seven dyeing mills affiliated with the China Textile Company, as well as the eight factories under the Municipal Industrial Bureau, including iron wire, flour, and bone glue factories, have also completed or exceeded their plans. The output of degelatinized bone meal at the bone glue factory increased from 11 tons per shift in early May to 17 tons.

The quality of general products in various factories has also significantly improved compared to before the competition. The quality of various products at the Tianjin Steel Plant has generally improved by 4% to 30%, with first-grade products of steel ingots, wire rods, manganese iron, and other products accounting for over 90% of the total output. In the first half of the month, first-grade products at Branch Factory No. 3 reached 100%.

In terms of saving raw materials and reducing costs, many factories have also made preliminary achievements. The rolling mill of Tianjin Steel Plant saved more than 32,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in one month, equivalent to more than 30,000 jin of millet. Coal consumption for boilers at China Textile Factory No. 2 was also reduced from 5,000 tons per month in the past to 3,000 tons. The unit cost of Hengda Flour Mill was reduced by 0.49%. The cotton waste and recycled silk at China Textile Factory No. 1 were nearly halved compared to April.

Technical personnel and veteran technicians in most factories have joined the competition and strengthened technical guidance, playing a significant role in improving technology and production. Technical personnel from units such as the Steel Plant and Electric Appliance Factory Nos. 1 and 2 frequently go deep into workshops to discuss and improve technology with workers, and promptly resolve difficulties in production. Engineers from Electric Appliance Factory No. 2 meticulously studied scientific labor organization and completed the assembly line operation method for both motor and transformer groups. Coupled with the powerful coordination of contract links, production efficiency rapidly improved. For example, the manufacturing time for a three-horsepower motor has been reduced from 88 hours to less than 50 hours, creating a new record. Veteran technician Zhu Baoju and others from the Steel Plant improved tools, increasing the efficiency of manufacturing rolled steel copper sheets by seven times.

In terms of production management, most factories have established or improved inspection and production record systems, and some factories have also established or improved machine responsibility systems, warehouse management systems, and attendance systems.

In the competition, many shortcomings and biases have also occurred: Firstly, when formulating plans, some factories did not mobilize employees well for discussions and formulate specific implementation measures, resulting in relatively empty plan content, a lack of focus, unclear goals, and even some employees not knowing what the competition was about. Secondly, most factories in the competition focused on increasing labor intensity and did not focus on improving technology and operation methods, resulting in many factories experiencing accidents such as motor damage and workers fainting from exhaustion. Thirdly, the factory management committees are generally still not sound enough. The leaders of general factories do not pay enough attention to rationalization proposals. Fourthly, although various factories have established a finished product inspection system, most factories have not earnestly implemented it.

　　天津七十余国营工厂
    大部超过原订计划  创造了许多新纪录
    【新华社天津二日电】津市国营、公营工厂七十余单位的六万余职工，自五月初开展生产竞赛运动以来，大部分工厂已胜利完成或超过五月份生产计划，创造了许多新纪录。天津制钢厂五月份新建马丁炉的工程超过原订计划百分之六十五，钢丝绳的产量超过原计划达百分之一百一十；中纺公司所属六个纱布厂及七个染厂，市工业局所属铁丝、面粉、骨胶等八个厂亦均完成或超过计划，骨胶厂的脱胶骨粉产量由五月初每班十一吨，提高至十七吨。
    各厂一般产品质量，亦较竞赛前有了显著提高。天津制钢厂各种产品质量普遍提高了百分之四至百分之三十，其中钢锭、盘条、锰铁等产品的一级产品占总产量的百分之九十以上；三分厂上半月的一级产品曾达百分之百。
    在节约原物料与减低成本方面，不少厂也有了初步成绩。天津制钢厂轧钢场，一个月来省电三万二千多度，折合小米三万余斤；中纺二厂锅炉用煤亦由过去每月五千吨减至三千吨；恒大面粉厂的单位成本降低百分之○·四九；中纺第一厂皮辊花、回丝等几较四月份减少二分之一。
    大部分工厂的技术人员和老技工都投入竞赛热潮，加强了技术指导，对提高技术、改进生产起了很大作用。制钢厂、电工器材厂一、二厂等单位的技术人员，经常深入车间，和工人研讨改进技术，及时解决了生产中的困难。电工器材厂第二厂的工程师，精心钻研科学的劳动组织，完成了马达和变压器两组的流水作业法，加上联系合同的有力配合，使生产效能迅速提高。如三匹马力马达的制造时间，已由八十八小时减到五十小时以内，创造了新纪录。制钢厂老技工朱宝琚等改进工具，使制造轧钢铜片的效能提高了七倍。
    在生产管理上，大部分工厂已建立或健全了检验和生产纪录等制度，部分工厂还建立或健全了机器负责制、仓库管理制及考勤制等。
    在竞赛运动中，也发生了不少缺点和偏向：首先是部分工厂在制订计划时，没有很好地发动职工进行讨论，并订出具体执行办法，致使计划内容比较空洞，缺乏中心，目标不明确，甚至有些职工还不知道竞赛内容是什么。其次，大部分工厂在竞赛中，偏重于提高劳动强度，没有着重提高技术和改进操作法，以致很多工厂发生损坏马达和累晕工人的事故。第三，工厂管理委员会一般仍不够健全。一般工厂的领导人员，对合理化建议还不够重视。第四，各厂虽然建立了成品检验制度，但大部工厂尚未认真贯彻执行。
