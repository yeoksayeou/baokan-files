    "The Fire at Huangsongling"
    Painting by Su Jian
    Poem by Ma Xun
    (20)
    The workers returning from abroad saw the fire,
    Rushing towards the lumberyard with doubled steps;
    "Fire!" they shouted.
    Zhao Jinglin took the lead,
    His expression grief-stricken, extremely anxious!
    "Damn it!" Old Zhao thought:
    He hadn't seen Old Yan, the devil, all day;
    Could he have started the fire?
    Sure enough, as they rushed to the lumberyard, the struggling director cried out:
    "Catch Old Yan, the devil..."
    Zhao Jinglin immediately sent two other workers to find the villain...
    (21)
    Soaring flames!
    Burning a large stack of lumber;
    Then attacking another stack of lumber!
    —Save it!
    —Save it!
    The property of the people's motherland;
    The sweat and blood of our labor!
    Old Zhao climbed onto the lumber stack,
    Moving the lumber;
    Forgetting the danger,
    Forgetting himself!
    Only one will dominated his mind:
    Without lumber, they couldn't survive.
    The fire crackled and popped,
    The director ran through the flames;
    He participated in the rescue,
    Bearing stick injuries!
    (22)
    The ferocious fire burned down the lumberyard,
    Millions of logs reduced to ashes!
    The fire rushed towards the forestry office,
    They began to tear down the wooden houses;
    The fire, like a wicked beast,
    Disregarded all the people's efforts,
    Roaring and expanding its terror!
    (23)
    The forestry office burned down,
    The fire raged on into the forest!
    Every worker was like a soldier going into battle,
    Fighting a desperate struggle against the enemy!
    But there were too few people,
    And the formation was disrupted by the fire!

    “黄松岭的火灾”
    苏坚画
    马寻诗
    （二十）
    放洋的工友们望见了火光，
    两步当一步的跑向楞场；
    “救火啊！”他们在喊。
    赵景林打头当先，
    神色悲愤，万分紧张！
    “糟了！”老赵心想：
    半天不见阎怪头；
    莫非是他放的火？
    果然，当他们奔至楞场挣扎起来的所长叫着：
    “快抓阎怪头……”
    赵景林立刻打发另两个工人去查找坏家伙……
    （二十一）
    冲天的大火啊！
    烧了一大垛木材；
    又扑向另一垛木材！
    ——救啊！
    ——救啊！
    人民祖国的财产；
    咱们劳动的血汗！
    老赵登上木垛，
    拨动木材；
    忘了危险，
    忘了自个！
    横在他心头的只有一个意志：
    没有木材，他们就不得活。
    火烧得劈拍直响，
    火焰中奔跑着所长；
    他参加抢救，
    带着棍伤！
    （二十二）
    凶暴的大火烧完了楞场，
    千百万棵原木归于灰烬！
    火势奔向林务所，
    他们又开始拆毁木屋；
    火像匹万恶的野兽，
    蔑视着人们所有的努力，
    吼叫着扩张它的恐怖！
    （二十三）
    林务所烧完了，
    大火又狂奔森林！
    工友个个像上战场，
    和敌人作殊死斗争！
    只是人手少啊，
    又被大火冲乱了阵营！
