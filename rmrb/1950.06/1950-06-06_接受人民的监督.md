　　Accepting Supervision from the People
    Our Reporter Pei Lan
    "The government in the past protected officials and oppressed the people; the current government promotes democracy and seeks truth from facts" – Representatives who attended the Beijing Sixth District People's Representative Conference all gained a strong impression of this. This is the result of earnestly promoting criticism and self-criticism, which has made the relationship between the government and the people closer than before.
    The representatives of the Sixth District People's Congress brought more than two thousand opinions from the masses to the District People's Congress. More than two hundred of these concerned the work style of cadres. These opinions criticized the bureaucracy of some staff and exposed the corrupt and degenerate behavior of a small number of cadres. The government attached great importance to these opinions. Before the meeting, they were sorted out clearly and sent to the relevant departments, and given to those who were criticized to reflect on and examine themselves, and they were urged to publicly admit their mistakes at the District People's Representative Conference.
    It has been more than a year since Beijing's liberation. Most of the cadres in the Sixth District (formerly Districts Eight and Nine) have been working hard, practically, and conscientiously. Many of them came from the old liberated areas, and because they had worked and lived in rural environments for a long time, they lacked knowledge of urban work when they first entered the city; newly recruited comrades lacked both experience and familiarity with policies; they encountered many difficulties in their past work. However, they did not shrink back from difficulties, and under the leadership of the Party and the government, they carried out and persisted in arduous study. They turned to books, consulted workers, citizens, and capitalists, and slowly found their way. Over the past year, the Sixth District has made considerable achievements in civil affairs, culture and education, production, municipal administration, health construction, consolidating revolutionary order, and stabilizing people's lives. These achievements have been unanimously recognized by the masses.
    Due to the rapid development of the situation, a large number of new districts were opened up one after another, and many cadres from the old liberated areas in the Sixth District were transferred, and a large number of new cadres were promoted. This has resulted in a situation of fewer cadres, lower quality, and heavy work tasks. In order to complete the tasks, the cadres were not good at using the working method of the mass line, which led to bureaucracy and coercion. This problem is quite common among the cadres in the Sixth District. There are also individual cadres with a long history of struggle who could not resist the temptation of urban material life and made mistakes of corruption and degeneration.
    The liberated people know exactly what standards to use to measure their staff. They see the good and bad of cadres very clearly. The masses submitted fifteen proposals to the Second Outer Branch Bureau, three of which praised the staff, and some even proposed to send plaques. But they also made strict and appropriate criticisms of those staff who were detached from the masses. Wang Quanbao, the secretary of the District Office, liked to put on airs and even refused to see family members of soldiers. The masses believe that this style is unacceptable! Fu Sudong of the Civil Affairs Section wrote letters of introduction for the masses. Some who went first waited for several hours without getting them, while some who went later got them first. The masses said that this was very unreasonable and should be improved. Some cadres in the Tax Bureau did not pay attention to publicity and education work. Some merchants asked them to explain some tax matters, which was a very reasonable request. However, some cadres ignored them, and some even said: "I can't delay my work because of you alone." The representatives specifically pointed out that the Tax Bureau should strengthen business education for its staff. Some tax officials went to a private department store to check taxes and casually said: "You can't sell watches!" The merchant asked: "Doesn't the state-owned department store also sell watches?" The cadre was stumped and had to say: "How can you compare with the state-owned department store!" The merchant swallowed the words into his stomach, feeling that there was no appropriate place to say them. The District People's Congress opened the door, and the masses raised many things they had not said in the past at the meeting. Of course, the District People's Congress was held for the first time, and the masses may still have some concerns in their minds, so all the words cannot be said at once. Even those that have been said are still a bit polite. It is believed that as more such meetings are held in the future, the masses will continue to make suggestions to the government and help the government improve its work.
    The District People's Representative Conference carefully studied these opinions, urged the relevant departments to conduct in-depth inspections, and designated the criticized cadres to reflect on and examine themselves. The heads of the District Office, the Public Security Sub-bureau, and the Tax Sub-bureau made self-criticisms at the meeting, affirming that the errors of bureaucracy, coercion, and even corruption and degeneration of cadres show that the heads of the departments themselves have serious bureaucracy, insufficient in-depth work, and insufficient education of cadres. They sincerely accepted the opinions of the representatives and the masses, and further announced a list of bad cadres that the masses had not yet raised, but the government had already discovered and dealt with. For example, Xia Jingui, the former head of the Civil Affairs Section of the Eighth District, had embezzled public funds and blackmailed residents. The District Office immediately launched a criticism after discovering it, asking Xia Jingui to reflect. The person in charge of the District Office reviewed and said: We ourselves also have a bureaucratic style of work, and after criticizing him, we did not do further inspection and supervision. As a result, Xia Jingui committed an irreparable mistake. He even smoked opium and lost public firearms. Now, Xia Jingui has been expelled from the Chinese Communist Party and has been handed over to the court for processing. The director of the Public Security Sub-bureau said: There are also some policemen who have beaten people, arbitrarily punished peddlers, and threatened the masses with guns, and we have dealt with them separately. The responsible persons of various departments' humble and sincere self-criticism further promoted the spirit of criticism and self-criticism at the meeting. There were no criticisms of educators in the original proposal. During the meeting, the principal of the Ninth District Central Primary School voluntarily made a self-criticism. Someone made criticisms on the spot for incidents that had not been raised.
    The five criticized cadres and policemen made public self-criticisms at the meeting, apologized to the masses, promised to correct their mistakes, and asked the masses to supervise them in many ways in the future. This sincere attitude won applause from the audience.
    At this District People's Congress, the government absorbed many opinions that had not been heard in the past, which is a great help for improving the work style of the staff. The people boldly said what they wanted to say and frankly criticized their cadres, which is the most practical democratic education for them. After the meeting, many representatives said with emotion: "This is truly a people's government!"

　　接受人民的监督
    本报记者  培蓝
    “过去的政府是官官相护，欺压百姓；现在的政府是发扬民主，实事求是”——参加了北京市第六区各界人民代表会议的代表，都得到这样一种强烈的印象。这是认真发扬批评与自我批评的结果，它使得政府与人民的关系，较前更密切了一步。
    第六区人代会的代表们，带着两千多条群众意见，到了区人代会上。其中二百多条是有关干部作风的。这些意见批评了某些工作人员的官僚主义，揭发了少数干部贪污、腐化的行为。政府十分重视这些意见。开会之前，即曾分别整理清楚，送交有关部门，交给被批评者反省检讨，并督促他们在区各界代表会上，公开承认错误。
    北京解放一年多了，第六区（原八、九两区）的干部，大多是艰苦、踏实、认真地工作着。其中不少从老解放区来的干部，由于较长时期工作、生活在农村环境中，刚一进城，比较缺乏城市工作的知识；新参加工作的同志，既缺乏经验，又不熟悉政策；他们在过去的工作中，曾遇到不少困难。但是，他们没有在困难之前退缩，他们在党与政府的领导下，进行并坚持了艰巨的学习。他们翻书，向工人、市民，与资本家请教，慢慢地摸到了门路。一年来，第六区在民政、文教、生产、市政、卫生建设；巩固革命秩序、安定人民生活等方面，都作出了不少成绩。这些成绩是被群众所一致公认的。
    由于形势发展十分迅速，广大新区陆续开辟，六区许多由老解放区来的干部被调走了，大量新干部被提拔上来。这就造成干部少，质量不高，工作任务繁重的情况。干部们为了完成任务，但不善于运用群众路线的工作方法，就发生了官僚主义与强迫命令的毛病。在六区的干部当中，这种毛病相当普遍地存在着。也有个别斗争历史较长的干部，经不起城市物质生活的引诱，发生了贪污腐化的错误。
    解放了的人民，完全知道用什么标准来衡量自己的工作人员。他们对干部的好坏，看得很清楚。群众对外二分局提了十五项提案，其中三项是表扬工作人员的，有的并提出要送匾。但对那些脱离群众的工作人员，也做了严格而又适如其分的批评。区公所秘书王全宝，喜欢摆架子，连军属都不敢见他。群众认为：这种作风要不得！民政科傅愫冬给群众写介绍信。有些先去的，等了几个钟头，还没有拿到，有些后去的，反而先拿到了。群众说，这很不合理，应当改进。税务局某些干部，不注意宣传教育工作。有些商人要求他们解释一些纳税的事情，这种要求是很合理的。但是，有的干部不理睬，有的还说：“不能因为你一个人耽误我的工作。”代表们特别提出：税务局对工作人员应加强业务教育。有的税务工作人员到私营百货公司查税，随便说：“你们不能卖手表！”商人问：“公营百货公司不是也卖手表吗？”这个干部被问住了，只好说：“你们怎么能和公营百货公司比！”商人把话咽到肚子里，觉得没有适当的地方去说。区人代会打开了大门，群众把许多过去没有说过的话，都在会上提出来了。当然，区人代会是第一次开，群众思想上还可能有些顾虑，所有的话，不可能一次说完。就是已经说出来的，也还有几分客气。相信今后这种会议开得多了，群众会不断地向政府提出意见，帮助政府改进工作。
    区各界人民代表会议，慎重地研究了这些意见，督促各有关部门深入检查，并指定被批评的干部反省检讨。区公所、公安分局、税务分局等机关的负责人，都在会上作了检讨，肯定指出：干部发生官僚主义、强迫命令、以至贪污腐化的错误，这种情况，说明各部门负责人本身就存在着严重的官僚主义，工作不深入，对干部教育不够。他们诚恳地接受了代表与群众的意见，并且进一步公布了群众还未提出，但是政府已经发觉并已处理了的坏干部名单。例如：原八区民政科长夏金贵，曾经贪污公款，敲诈居民。区公所发觉了马上展开批评，要夏金贵反省。区公所负责人检讨说：我们自己也存在着官僚主义作风，对他批评过后，没有再做进一步的检查监督。结果，夏金贵犯了不可挽救的错误。他甚至吸上大烟，丢了公家的枪支。现在，夏金贵已被开除中共党籍，并已送交法院处理。公安分局局长说：还有一些警士动手打人，随意处罚摊贩，用手枪威胁群众的事情，我们都已分别处理。各部门负责人员虚心诚恳的检讨，进一步推动了大会上批评与自我批评的精神。原提案里没有提出对教育工作者的批评。会中，九区中心小学校长自动作了检讨。有人当场对于未曾提出的事件做了批评。
    被批评的五个干部和警士，在会上作了公开的检讨，向群众道歉，保证改正错误，并要求群众今后多方监督。这种诚恳的态度，博得全场欢迎的掌声。
    在这次区人代会上，政府吸收了许多过去没有听到过的意见，对于改进工作人员的作风，是一个很大的帮助。人民大胆地说出自己想说的话，坦白地批评了自己的干部，对于他们，这是一种最实际的民主教育。会后，好多代表感慨地说：“这才真正是人民的政府！”
