Jingxi Coal Mine and Other Units
　　Neglect Pre-Rain Prevention Work
　　Resulting in Losses to State Assets
[Our Newspaper] Several units under the city, including Jingxi Coal Mining Company, Yanjing Paper Mill, Xin Jian Pharmaceutical Factory, Huaxing Textile and Dyeing Factory, and Longxing Brick Factory, neglected rain prevention work. During the rainfall in April, the machine rooms and warehouses leaked, causing losses to state property. During the three days of rainfall on April 14th, 15th, and 16th, the newly built warehouse of Yanjing Paper Mill leaked, wetting more than 100 reams of paper, of which 18 reams were rendered useless. Calculating an average of 80,000 yuan per ream, the total loss was 1.44 million yuan. The warehouse of the Xin Jian Pharmaceutical Factory leaked, wetting twelve kinds of medicines. Fortunately, they were discarded medicines, so the loss was small. The Huaxing Textile and Dyeing Factory stopped work for one and a half days due to the machine room leaking, producing 60 fewer bolts of cloth (including pocket cloth), dyeing 200 fewer bolts of yarn-dyed cloth, and wetting 24 bolts, of which 4 bolts were damaged and faded. The Longxing Brick Factory had 36 newly built machine rooms collapse from the rain, injuring four contracted workers. At Jingxi Coal Mine, more than 140 worker dormitories collapsed from the rain and were blown down by strong winds. The reason for these serious losses is mainly due to the administrative leadership's negligence in rain prevention, lack of inspection, and failure to take preventive measures beforehand. For example, Huaxing Textile and Dyeing Factory knew that the machine room was leaking, but failed to actively repair it. After the Xin Jian Pharmaceutical Factory discovered the warehouse was leaking, the factory leaders did not pay enough attention and only asked a few workers to move things out of the warehouse. The Mentougou Coal Mine usually does not pay attention to repairing the worker dormitories. After the rain, seeing the worker dormitories constantly collapsing, they gathered 35 employees and the security team overnight to inspect the worker dormitories. Based on the above situation, it is recommended that the administrative leaders of all enterprises: 1. Pay attention to rain prevention work in the rainy season ideologically. Larger industrial and mining enterprises should preferably organize rain prevention work groups. Assign specific personnel to be responsible for rain prevention work in each machine room, warehouse, worker dormitory, etc. Add necessary rain prevention equipment. 2. Regularly inspect machine rooms, warehouses, worker dormitories, and actively repair places that need to be repaired. 3. Educate employees on rain prevention, moisture prevention, and cherishing the property of the motherland.

　　京西煤矿等单位
    疏于雨前防范工作
    国家资财遭受损失
    【本报讯】市属京西煤矿公司、燕京造纸厂、新建制药厂、华兴染织厂、隆兴窑厂等五个单位，忽视防雨工作，四月降雨时，机器房，仓库漏水，使国家财产受到损失。四月十四、十五、十六三天降雨中，燕京造纸厂新修仓库漏进雨水，淋湿纸一百余令，其中十八令作废。每令平均以八万元计算，共损失一百四十四万元。新建制药厂仓库漏水，淋湿十二种药品，幸是废药，损失尚小。华兴染织厂因机房漏雨，停工一天半，少织布六十匹（其中有口袋布），少染纱布二百余匹，淋湿二十四匹，其中有四匹淋坏退色。隆兴窑厂淋塌新修机房三十六间，压伤包工工人四人。京西煤矿淋塌及大风刮倒工房一百四十余间。造成这种严重损失的原因，主要是各单位行政领导上的疏忽防雨、缺乏检查和事先预防。如华兴染织厂早知机房漏雨，但未能积极设法修缮。新建制药厂发现仓库漏雨后，该厂领导方面并未引起足够重视，只叫几个工友搬出仓库的东西。门头沟煤矿平时不注意修补工房，下雨后看到工房不断倒塌，才连夜集合职工三十五人及保卫队，到工人宿舍检查。根据以上情况，建议各企业行政领导：一、从思想上引起对雨季防范工作的注意。较大工矿企业，最好组织雨季防范工作组。各机房、仓库、工人宿舍等，指定专人负责防雨工作。增设防雨必要设备。二、经常检查机房、仓库、工人宿舍，应修补的地方，要积极设法修补。三、对职工进行防雨、防潮、爱护祖国财产的教育。
