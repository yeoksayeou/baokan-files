　　“The motherland’s ocean is vast… Build a steel national defense… Make the people’s power as solid as steel… Forever guarding the motherland’s borders.” This majestic song broke through the howling of the sea breeze and the roar of the waves. The national defense warriors who went to the sea to build the new port sailed eastward into the sea on a boat. Everyone on the boat was happily shouting and singing, some waving to comrades working on the shore. At this time, on the dock, many warriors with sacks around their waists and gloves worn to the point of fraying were pushing four-wheeled flatcars loaded with large stones, running on the tracks. These comrades were also sending them off with challenging looks and smiles. After one hour and forty minutes of sailing, they arrived at the harbor marked with embankment construction. This was already twenty or thirty *li* from the coast. The warriors would build a large eastern commercial port here.

　　The sea breeze in May was still so cold that the comrades were shivering even wearing cotton-padded coats. But when the work started, everyone forgot the cold and took off their cotton clothes. Most comrades only wore shorts, and the ear flaps of their cotton hats were pulled down to tightly wrap their faces. Large stones were quickly thrown from the boat into the sea, splashing more than ten *zhang* high, constantly hitting their faces and bodies. They responded to this relentless attack of the sea with more stones.

　　All the comrades who transported and unloaded stones had injuries on their bodies. But everyone's enthusiasm did not slacken at all. Squad Leader Zhu Yushan was pushing a large stone on the side of the boat, and because he used too much force, the stone fell into the water, and he also fell in with a "plop." After coming up, even though he was soaked and his mouth tasted salty, he continued to work regardless of everything. Company Commander Liu Chen was with everyone, and after quickly unloading the stones from his boat, he went to help other boats. Because they were more than ten meters away from other boats, they waded through the water, stepping on the stones piled up in the sea to swing over. Company Commander Liu lost his footing and slipped into the water. After the workers on the boat rescued him, he continued to lead the warriors to work until everything was unloaded.

　　The anchor was raised, and the boat began to sail back. The warriors lay on the deck, enjoying the caress of the sun and the sea breeze. This arduous project of building the foundation of the new port embankment was being raised higher day by day in the hands of these steel warriors tempered in battle. Now the stones have protruded from the sea.

### 修筑新港的战士们

　　修筑新港的战士们
    鹰
    “祖国的海洋波涛万丈……建设起钢铁的国防……让人民的政权巩固如钢……永远守卫在祖国的边疆。”这雄壮的歌声冲破了海风的呼啸和浪涛的巨响。到海里去修筑新港的国防战士们，坐着船向东方的大海开进了。大家在船上愉快地喊着、唱着，有的和在岸上劳动着的同志们打招呼。这时在码头上，正有不少战士腰间围着麻袋，手上戴着早已磨出棉花来的手套，推着装满大石块的四轮小平车，在铁道上跑着。这些同志也在用挑战的目光和微笑欢送他们。经过一点四十分钟的航行，才到达有修堤标帜的港湾里。这儿已经离海岸二、三十里地了。战士们就要在这里建设起一个东方的大商港。
    五月的海风还是那样的冷，同志们穿着棉袄还被吹得打战。但当工作开始的时候，大家却忘记了寒冷，全都脱去了棉衣。大部分同志下身只穿了一件裤衩，把棉帽子的帽耳放下来，紧紧地裹住了脸。大石块飞快地从船上扔下海去，水花溅起一丈多高，不断地打在他们的脸上和身上。他们就拿更多的石块来回答这无情的海水的袭击。
    所有搬运、装卸石头的同志们，没有一个身上不带伤的。但是大家干的劲头一点也不松懈。一排长朱玉山同志在船边上推着一块大石头，因用力过猛，石头落水，人也“扑通”一声，随着跌了下去。上来以后，虽然混身都是水，嘴里也发咸，但还是不顾一切地工作下去。连长刘臣同志和大家在一起，把自己船上的石头很快卸完之后，又去帮助别的船。因为和别的船相距十几米远，他们就下水踏着海里垫起的石头荡过去。刘连长一脚没站稳，滑到水里。船上的工友把他救上来以后，他依旧带动着战士们干，直到全部卸完。
    起锚了，船开始往回驶。战士们都躺在甲板上，享受着阳光和海风的爱抚。这一艰巨的修筑新港堤基的工程，在这些从战斗中锻炼出来的钢铁战士手下，一天比一天加高起来。现在石头已经突出了海面。
