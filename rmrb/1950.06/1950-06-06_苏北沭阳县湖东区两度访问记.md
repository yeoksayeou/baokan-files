Two Visits to Hudong District, Shuyang County, Northern Jiangsu
	Ye Duyi

In mid-January of this year, I was ordered to inspect the disaster situation in northern Jiangsu. There were ten people in our group. We departed from Yangzhou on January 21st and arrived at Shuyang County, the seat of the Huaiyin Special District, on January 23rd. The disaster situation in the entire northern Jiangsu region was most severe in Shuyang County, and the Hudong District of Shuyang County was the most severely affected. In order to fulfill the instructions given to us by Director Dong when we departed from Beijing: "You must personally experience the disaster situation," we only stayed in the county office for two days to listen to reports. On the morning of January 25th, accompanied by Liu Xijiu, Deputy Commissioner of the Huaiyin District, and Li Lizhao, Deputy County Magistrate of Shuyang County, we went to Hudong District for inspection.

We chose Dingzhuang Township in Hudong District to inspect, because Dingzhuang Township can represent a typical severely affected village. The disaster situation in Xiwu Township was even more severe and prominent than that in Dingzhuang Township, but Deputy Commissioner Liu said, "The special circumstances there cannot represent the general disaster situation. If we believe that all severely affected villages in Shuyang are like that, it would be an exaggeration of the understanding of the disaster situation."

When our group of fifteen people arrived in Dingzhuang Township, the news that "Chairman Mao has sent people!" quickly spread throughout the front, middle, and rear three villages. That evening, dozens of cadres and villagers gathered for informal talks. Everyone talked about the pain of suffering from floods and Chiang Kai-shek's disasters over the years, and then talked about Chairman Mao's concern for the people and how to intensify production to overcome the famine in order to repay Chairman Mao's kindness. During the struggle against the enemy, Dingzhuang Township suffered five "sweeps" and seven robberies. The most serious loss was in May 1947 when wheat was just coming on the market. 420 *shi* of wheat, 57 head of cattle, 6 fat pigs, more than 200 door panels, and more than 100 silver dollars were robbed. Six men and women were killed. Many villagers were severely persecuted by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and fled to other places. In that year, more than 23,000 *mu* of land were abandoned.

The next morning, we divided into three groups and went deep into the severely affected households in the front, middle, and rear villages of the township to conduct investigations and offer condolences. Director Dong instructed us to experience the disaster situation. Without personal experience, it is indeed difficult to imagine the lives of the disaster victims. The disaster victims we saw were not only sallow and emaciated, some had faces that were even darker than the soil, and were so thin that their skin clung to their bones. Some had swollen, pale faces with no trace of blood. Apart from a few cotton clothes that had been provided by the government, most were scantily clad and tattered. The disaster victims lived in dilapidated thatched houses and had nothing in their homes. They slept on the ground on a single straw mat. When we personally saw these snippets of the lives of the disaster victims, we could not help but feel infinitely ashamed when we compared our lives as people's servants with theirs.

When I arrived at the door of Sun Rutian's house, a severely affected household, Sun Laodie, who was in his fifties, and Sun Laonainai thought that Chairman Mao had arrived. They hurried to the door and knelt on the ground to kowtow, saying, "Chairman Mao, you are our great savior!" I told him that I was sent by Chairman Mao to see them. Sun Laonainai said, "Chairman Mao cares about us so much, we will never forget him." After leaving his house, I went to another severely affected household. All the adults in this family had gone out to dig wild vegetables. There was only one child of six or seven years old at home. When he saw me enter his house, he immediately burst into tears and said, "We have no food at home." I was at a loss at the time. After some explanation, the child said that when he saw me enter his house in uniform, he thought that the Kuomintang army had come again. Three years ago, his family had been robbed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, who stole their grain and injured people. So when he saw me, he was scared and cried that they had no food. Here, I not only experienced the disaster situation, experienced the people's love for Chairman Mao, but also experienced the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek.

We were concerned that social order might be chaotic and unstable in such a severely affected area. But after our investigation, not a single robbery occurred here. This is truly a historical miracle. It proves that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people have a high degree of political awareness. The disaster victims all know that the famine is temporary and the future is infinitely bright.

More than 90% of the people in this township rely on a nearby Sijia Marsh. Everyone goes to the marsh every day to dig *fuzi* (plant tubers) to survive. The next day, all the comrades in our inspection group, barefoot, walked two or three *li* to the marsh to visit them. Many disaster victims ran out of the mud, looking at us in surprise. They said to each other: This is really the imperial envoy on an inspection tour, Liu Yong on a private visit. Only people sent by Chairman Mao can do this. The county magistrate of the "little barbarians" (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) does not even come out of the county seat, let alone ask them to come barefoot to the marsh!

On the day our work in this township ended, all the disaster victims in the township decided to write a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting their confidence in production and disaster relief, and thanking Chairman Mao for his concern for them. When we left, we brought back this letter. The content of the letter is as follows: Chairman Mao:

We have been flooded here for five consecutive years, and last year was the worst. It rained continuously from April to August, and the water in the fields was so deep that one could not reach the bottom. It also flooded into the houses. Each *mu* of wheat yielded only thirty to forty *jin* of grain, and the autumn harvest was considered to be zero. Because the floods have been going on for years, and there were also the "sweeps" and grain robberies by Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the past, and the "Homecoming Corps" extorting money, the people have been exhausted. Now, all ten families here are eating *fuyanggen* (grass roots) and wild vegetables. On rainy days, we have to go hungry. The Communist Party and our government have come up with ways to help us, lending us grain to open oil mills, process starch, spin yarn, and so on for production. We also go to the lake every day to dig *fu*, pick wild vegetables, and mix them with grain to eat. Fishing and weaving mats can also earn money. In the spring, the strong people go to dig rivers to earn grain. Although the harvest is poor, we are not worried if we work hard. Chairman Mao:

You led us to distribute land, houses, and cattle. We believe even more that you will be able to lead us to overcome the famine. We are very grateful for your concern for us! You sent more than a dozen people thousands of *li* to see us. These two days, we felt like we were with you. Finally, we wish you good health!

January 27th

We left Dingzhuang Township with this letter. They sent us off, reluctant to part. We told them that we would guarantee to report their disaster situation and their gratitude to Chairman Mao to Chairman Mao and the Central Government when we returned to Beijing.

The Central People's Government is so concerned about the disaster situation in northern Jiangsu. Just one month after sending out one inspection group, it sent out another inspection group to northern Jiangsu. The first inspection group went there to experience the disaster situation. The second inspection group went there again to see if the disaster victims in northern Jiangsu could survive the spring famine, what special difficulties the leadership had, and what help was needed to solve them.

Two months passed, and I came to Shuyang again for the second time. "The famine fears the end, not the beginning." Two months ago, the disaster situation in Hudong District was so severe. I indeed left there with a very heavy heart. Could they safely survive the spring famine? To be honest, I had no confidence at the time. Am I going to Hudong District again this time? On the one hand, I wanted to go, to see them. I really developed feelings for them. But on the other hand, I was afraid to go, afraid to see their disaster situation worsen than last time, afraid to know that they could not survive the spring famine, especially afraid to hear the news that the children I photographed last time might have died. I thought about it for several days. Finally, reason overcame emotion, and I decided to go to Hudong District again for the second time.

This time, I was accompanied by Huang Haiyang, the secretary of the Shuyang County Government. As we entered the territory of Hudong District, I could not help but recall the last time I came here. The wilderness was quiet and there was no sound of people. It made us feel as lonely as in the desert. There were few pedestrians on the road. Occasionally, when we met two or three people, their faces were gloomy and there was no smile at all. They did not say a word to each other on the road. This time the situation was different. Before we even reached Dingzhuang Township, we could hear children blowing through reed-made horns from afar. When I entered the township, I saw children running around in groups, blowing and beating drums. My heavy mood suddenly opened up. After two or three months, the situation in Dingzhuang Township had not deteriorated, but had improved.

As soon as I entered the township, everyone swarmed around me, as if they were meeting an old friend they had not seen for many years. "Chairman Mao has sent someone to see us again." "If it weren't for the Communist Party, eight out of ten people in our village would have died." "The government took so much grain to dredge the river, and took so much grain to help us. We will never forget it." Everyone said one after another, endlessly. Their complexions had generally improved, and their interest was also higher than last time. I also visited each of the children I had photographed last time. Not only were they all still alive, but they were all living better lives than before. The child who cried when he saw me last time smiled when he saw me now. Everyone surrounded me and said, "When you go back, report to Chairman Mao and tell him to rest assured that we can survive the spring famine." That's right, Dingzhuang Township can indeed successfully survive the spring famine.

The disaster situation in Dingzhuang Township represents a typical severely affected village, but there is also Xiwu Township, where the disaster situation is even more severe than that in Dingzhuang Township. Last time I came to Hudong District, Deputy Commissioner Liu did not recommend that I go to Xiwu, because if the situation there is considered general, it would actually exaggerate the understanding of the disaster situation. This time, after seeing the situation in Dingzhuang Township, I decided to go to Xiwu Township to see what the situation was in this famous super-severely affected township.

The day I arrived in Xiwu Township was the day they were holding a village meeting to discuss spring planting. After the meeting, the village cadres introduced me to say a few words to them. I introduced the situation I had seen in Dingzhuang Township twice. When I mentioned what the villagers in Dingzhuang Township said to me, "If it weren't for the Communist Party, eight out of ten people in our village would have died," the masses immediately responded, "If ten out of ten in Dingzhuang Township would die, then ten out of ten of us would die." They asked me to report to Chairman Mao when I returned, that they could survive the spring famine, that they thanked Chairman Mao, and that they would work hard in spring planting and intensify production to repay Chairman Mao's kindness to them.

The next day, I visited the severely affected households in Xiwu Township one by one. I had never been here before and did not know how severe the disaster situation was here in the past, but it is said that the disaster situation here is even more severe than in Dingzhuang Township, so the disaster situation can be imagined. This time I personally experienced it, and there is no doubt that the disaster situation here is severe. In one village, 96% of the disaster victims rely on relief grain to maintain their lives. The disaster situation in this township is severe, but the government has used great efforts to help this township, and there is no doubt that it can successfully survive the spring famine.

After I arrived in Xiwu Township, my heart was completely at ease. Shuyang, the first-class severely affected county in northern Jiangsu, Hudong, the first-class severely affected district, and Xiwu, the super-severely affected township, can successfully survive the spring famine. It can be said with certainty that the spring famine in the entire northern Jiangsu has been basically resolved.

Just as I was about to leave Xiwu, several people were suddenly sent by the village to bring a letter and entrust me to hand it over to Chairman Mao. The content of the letter is as follows: Chairman Mao:

Wishing you good health and building a new China. The masses of Xiwu Village were ravaged by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and suffered from floods. There have been nine major floods in five years. Fortunately, Chairman Mao saved our lives, otherwise we would have starved to death. We have been eating grain since last winter until now without knowing the amount. We respectfully thank Chairman Mao for being our great benefactor. From now on, we will live a peaceful and happy life. All of us will intensify production to support the front line, hoping to conquer Taiwan early and eliminate the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek. With best regards,
The entire villagers of Xiwu Village bowing
Two or three months ago, the letter that Dingzhuang Township entrusted me to bring to Chairman Mao said, "We believe even more that you will be able to lead us to overcome the famine." They were right. Chairman Mao led Hudong District of Shuyang County, led the entire northern Jiangsu, and led the disaster areas across the country. Now it can be guaranteed to successfully survive the spring famine.

　　苏北沭阳县湖东区两度访问记
    叶笃义
    今年一月中旬我奉命到苏北视察灾情，我们一组共十个人。一月二十一日由扬州出发，二十三日抵达淮阴专署驻地沭阳县城。苏北全区的灾情以沭阳县为最重，沭阳县又以湖东区为最严重。为了实现由北京出发时董主任给我们的指示：“你们要亲身体验灾情”。我们在县署里只停留了两天听取汇报，二十五日晨即由淮阴区刘锡九副专员，沭阳县李立沼副县长陪同前往湖东区视察。
    我们选择了湖东区丁庄乡去视察，因为丁庄乡可以代表一般重灾村的典型，西圩乡的灾情比丁庄乡更严重、更突出，但刘副专员说：“那里的特殊情形不能代表一般灾情，假如认为沭阳所有重灾村都是那样，那就扩大了灾情的认识了。”
    我们一行十五人抵达丁庄乡后，“毛主席派人来了！”这个消息很快的传遍了前、中、后三个村子。当晚干部、群众数十人集会漫谈，大家从历年遭受水灾蒋灾的痛苦说起，一直谈到毛主席给予人民的关心，如何加紧生产度荒以报答毛主席的盛意。丁庄乡在敌我斗争中，曾遭五次“扫荡”，七次抢劫，其中损失最重的一次是一九四七年五月麦正登场时，被抢去麦子四百二十石、耕牛五十七头，肥猪六只、门板二百余付、白洋百余元，男女群众遭杀害的六人、群众遭受蒋匪严重残害而逃往他乡，当年土地抛荒达二万三千多亩。
    次晨我们分成三组深入该乡前、中、后三村重灾户，进行调查及慰问。董主任指示我们体验灾情。没有亲身体验，对灾民生活确是难以想像的。所见到的灾民不仅面黄饥瘦，有的脸比泥土还黝黑、瘦得皮包骨头，有的是面孔浮肿苍白，没有丝毫血色。除少数得到政府救济的棉衣，大多数都是衣不遮身、破烂不堪。灾民除住残破草房外，家徒四壁，草席一张就地而寝。我们亲眼看到这些片断的灾民生活，作为人民勤务员的我们的生活与之对照一下不禁无限惭愧。
    我走到重灾户孙汝田家屋门口，五十多岁的孙老爹和孙老奶奶以为是毛主席来了，连忙迎到门口伏在地上磕头说：“毛主席你是大救星呀！”我告诉他说：我是毛主席派来看他们的，孙老奶奶说：“毛主席这样关心我们，永也忘不掉他。”我从他家出来随后又走到一家重灾户去。这家里大人都出去挖野菜去了，家里只有一个六、七岁的小孩，他一见我进到他家，马上放声大哭说：“我们家里没有粮。”我当时弄得莫名其妙，经过解释之后，这个小孩说：他看见我穿着一身制服进到他家，他以为国民党军队又来了。三年前他家曾遭过蒋匪的抢劫，抢走了粮食，还打伤了人，所以他一见我就吓的哭说没有粮食。我在这里不但体验了灾情；体验了老百姓对毛主席的爱戴；并且也体验了蒋介石的罪恶。
    我们曾顾虑：在这样严重灾区，可能发生社会秩序混乱与不安现象。但我们调查清楚后，这里并没有发生一件盗匪抢劫事件，这真是一个历史奇迹。证明人民在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，有了高度的政治觉悟，灾胞都知道灾荒是暂时的，前途是无限光明远大的。
    这个乡百分之九十以上的人，都靠着附近有一个司家荡，大家每天都到荡里挖芙子吃度命。第二天我们视察组全体同志赤着脚走了二三里地下荡去访问他们。许多灾民从污泥中跑来，惊奇的望着我们，他们互相说：这真是巡按出朝，刘墉私访。只有毛主席派来的人能够这样，小蛮子（指蒋匪）的县长连县城都不出来一步，别说叫他们来光着脚下荡啦！
    我们在这乡里工作结束的那天，全乡的灾胞决定写一封信给毛主席，报告生产救灾的信心，和感谢毛主席对他们的关怀。我们临走的时候，把这封信带回来了，信的内容是这样的：毛主席：
    我们这里连住（续）被水淹五年，去年顶厉害。就打四月里滴滴拉拉下到八月，地里水深一人打不到底，还朝屋里漫。麦口一亩地才收三四十斤粮，秋季就算一粒未收。因为水不是一年，还有过去蒋匪军“扫荡”、抢粮食，“还乡团”敲竹杠，老百姓被闹得枯竭透了。现在我们这里十家就十家吃芙秧根（草根）和野菜，阴雨天就要挨饿。共产党和我们的政府已替我们想出办法来了，借粮食给我们开油坊、拐粉、纺纱等等生产。我们又天天下湖挖芙挑野菜拌粮吃，?鱼、织席也能挣钱，春天有劲的人又去扒河挣粮食，年成虽荒，下苦作活就不焦。毛主席：
    你领导我们分到了土地、屋子、耕牛，我们更相信你一定能领导我们度过灾荒。我们非常感谢你对我们的关心！你派十几个人千乡百里的来看我们，这两天我们心里就觉得和你在一块一样。最后祝你身体健康！
    苏北沭阳县湖东区丁庄乡前中后三村全体农民
  一月廿七日
    我们带着这封信、离开了丁庄乡，他们送我们走，依依不舍。我们向他们表示，保证把他们的灾情和对毛主席的感谢，回到北京报告毛主席、报告中央。
    中央人民政府对苏北的灾情太关心了，刚刚派出去一个视察组回来一个月以后，又再度派出去一个视察组到苏北。第一个视察组是到那里体验灾情，第二个视察组再度到那里看了苏北灾胞，究竟能不能度过春荒，领导上有什么特殊困难，需要帮助解决。
    时间隔了两个多月，我第二次又来到沭阳。“灾荒怕尾不怕头”，两个多月以前湖东区的灾情是那样严重，我的确抱着一个很沉重的心离开那里的，究竟他们能不能平平安安的度过春荒？老实说我当时没有丝毫信心。我这次又来到沭阳，是不是再去湖东区呢？我一方面想去，想去看看他们，我对他们实在发生感情了。但是另一方面我又怕去，怕看他们的灾情比上次更恶化下去，怕知道他们度不过去春荒，尤其是怕听说我上次拍下照片来的几个小孩子可能已经死亡的消息。我考虑了好几天，最后理智克服了感情，我决定第二次再到湖东区。
    这次是由沭阳县政府秘书黄海洋同我两个人去的。当我们走进湖东区境内，我不禁回想起上次我来到这里，四野静悄悄的没有人声。使我们寂寞得好像在沙漠中一样，路上行人寥寥，偶尔遇到两三个人，脸上也是阴沉沉的没有一点笑容，走在路上彼此一句话也没有。这次情形不同了，我们还没走到丁庄乡，老远就听见小孩子用芦苇做成喇叭吹的声音。等我走进乡里，看见小孩子吹吹打打三五成群跑来跑去。我的沉重心情顿然开放了，丁庄乡经过两三个月以后，情形并没有恶化，反而变好了。
    我一走进乡里，大家轰的一下马上把我包围起来，如同遇到多年不见的老朋友一样。“毛主席又派人来看我们了”，“要是没有共产党，我们这村里十个人就得死八个”、“政府拿那么多粮食扒河，又拿那么多粮食来救济我们，我们永远也忘不了。”大家你一言我一语，说个不休。他们的脸色一般的都转过来了，兴致也比上次提高了。我又把上次拍下照片的几个小孩子一一访问了一遍，他们不但都还健在，并且都比从前更好的生活着。上次看见我哭的那个小孩，现在看见我笑了。大家围着我说：“你回去对毛主席报告，请他放心，我们可以度过春荒了。”一点不错，丁庄乡确是可以胜利度过春荒。
    丁庄乡的灾情是代表一般重灾村的，但是还有一个西圩乡，灾情比丁庄乡还更严重。上次来到湖东区，刘副专员不主张我去西圩，因为假如把那里的情形认为一般化，实际上就扩大了灾情的认识。我这次看到了丁庄乡的情况以后，决定再到西圩乡去，看看这个出名的超级重灾乡究竟情形怎么样。
    我到西圩乡的那一天，正当那里开村民大会，讨论春种问题。会开过后，村干介绍我向他们讲几句话。我把我两次在丁庄乡看见的情形向他们介绍了一下，当我说到丁庄乡老乡对我说的“要没有共产党，我们这里十个人就得死八个”的时候，群众马上反映说：“丁庄乡要是十个死八个，我们就得十个死十个。”他们要求我回来向毛主席报告，他们可以度过春荒，他们感谢毛主席，他们努力春种加紧生产来报答毛主席对他们的好处。
    我第二天把西圩乡的重灾户逐一访问了一番。我从前没有到过这里，不知道这里的灾情从前严重到什么地步，不过据说这里的灾情比丁庄乡还更重，灾情那也就可想而知了。这次我亲身体验了一下，这里的灾情重是没有问题的，有一个村百分之九十六的灾民赖救济粮维持生活。这个乡的灾情是严重的，但是政府用了绝大的力量救济这个乡，胜利度过春荒是没有任何问题的。
    我到了西圩乡以后，我的心完全放下了。苏北的一等重灾县——沭阳，一等重灾区——湖东，超级重灾乡——西圩，可以胜利度过春荒，整个苏北的春荒应当可以肯定地说已经基本上解决了。
    我正要离开西圩的时候，突然村里派来了几个人，带来一封信，托我转交毛主席，信的内容如下：毛主席：
    祝你身体健康，建设新中国，我们西圩村群众，被蒋匪蹂躏，又招（遭）水患，五年九场大水。全村五百六十四人，幸亏毛主席救命，不然就饿死了。自从去年寒天至现在吃的粮食无有数目，我们敬谢毛主席是我们大恩人，向后就过太平幸福日子了，我们全体加紧生产支援前方，希望提早打下台湾消灭蒋匪残余为祷！此致敬礼    
  西圩村全体村民鞠躬
    两三个月以前，丁庄乡托我带给毛主席的信里面说：“我们更相信你一定能领导我们度过灾荒”。他们说对了，毛主席领导沭阳县湖东区，领导整个苏北，领导全国的灾区现在可以保证胜利度过春荒。
   五月十六日
