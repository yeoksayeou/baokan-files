　　Letter to the Respected Chairman Mao
　　Learning Model of a Certain Division of the People's Liberation Army, Chen Shibin, Writes a Letter to Thank Chairman Mao
Respected Chairman Mao:

　　I used to be a worker. In the old society, I suffered all kinds of torments. My father and mother died very early. I started begging for food at the age of nine, started working at the age of sixteen, and was drafted into the army by the Kuomintang reactionaries at the age of twenty-three. It was not until the liberation of Beijing last year that I returned to the ranks of the people.

　　After I joined the People's Liberation Army under your leadership, the soldiers, cadres, and Party members cared for me like brothers. They patiently explained your ideas to me, making me go from confused to clear-headed, and I knew who my enemies were and who my saviors were. What moved me the most was that since I joined the People's Liberation Army, it was like entering a university. In the old society, I had no opportunity to learn. I have been in the People's Liberation Army for less than a year and a half, and under the leadership of the Party and with the help of comrades, I have learned more than 2,000 characters, and now I can read newspapers and write letters. The newspaper praised me. Beijing People's Broadcasting Station also invited me to broadcast at the station. The division leaders talked to me, bought me pens and books, and let me participate in the instructor training class. These are things I never dreamed of in the past. I can only thank you. I joined the revolution late and contributed very little to the people; but the country cares for me so much that it has turned me from a "pauper" who was looked down upon everywhere into a glorious Communist Party member. I used to be an illiterate ignoramus, but now I have a rough understanding of writing. I can only thank you—Chairman Mao!

　　I will continue to work hard, study culture, and further improve myself. As long as imperialism exists for one day, I will hold a gun to the end to defend the motherland and defend you!

　　I will work harder to learn how to use new weapons and master science and technology. Whatever the people want me to do, I will do.

　　I assure you that I will study hard, produce actively, carry out the revolution to the end under your leadership, and never forget the respected Chairman Mao.

　　With best regards!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Soldier Chen Shibin

　　写给敬爱的毛主席
    人民解放军某师学习模范  陈世彬写信感谢毛主席敬爱的毛主席：
    我以前是一个工人。在旧社会里，我受尽了折磨。我父亲母亲很早就死了。我九岁就开始讨饭，十六岁开始做工，二十三岁时被国民党反动派抓去当了兵。去年北京解放后，我才回到了人民的队伍。
    我参加了您所领导的人民解放军后，战士们、干部们、党员们都像弟兄一样地关心我。他们耐心地向我解释您的主张，使我从糊涂到清醒，知道了谁是我的仇人，谁是我的救命恩人。使我最受感动的是：我自从到了解放军，就像进了大学堂。在旧社会里，我没有学习的机会。我参加人民解放军还不到一年半，在党的领导和同志们的帮助下，学会了二千多字，现在已经能看报、能写信了。报纸表扬我。北京人民广播电台还请我到电台广播。师首长请我谈话，给我买笔、买书，让我参加指导员训练班学习。这些都是我过去做梦也没有想到的事。我只有感谢您。我参加革命很晚，对人民贡献很少；而国家对我这样关怀，使我由一个到处被人看不起的“穷光蛋”，变为一个光荣的共产党员。我原是一个大字不识的睁眼瞎子，现在却粗通文字了。我只有感谢您——毛主席！
    我将继续努力，学习文化，再进一步地提高自己。只要帝国主义还存在一天，我就要手拿枪杆干到底，来保卫祖国，保卫您！
    我更要努力学习使用新的武器，掌握科学技术。人民要我做什么，我就做什么。
    我向您保证：我要努力学习、积极生产，在您的领导下革命到底，并且永远不忘记敬爱的毛主席。
                            此致敬礼！
                                           战士  陈世彬
                                            六月十一日
