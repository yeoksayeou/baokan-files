　　Romania's Oil Industry
    Hu Sisheng
    Romania's oil production ranks fifth in the world. In the domestic economic life, the oil industry occupies an extremely important position. All of Romania's power institutions, such as railways, power stations, heavy industry and other enterprises, mainly rely on oil for fuel.

    The Carpathian Mountains winding through northern and central Romania, and various mountainous areas within the country, are major oil producing areas. Ploiesti, north of Bucharest, is the central oil production area. Constanta, on the Black Sea coast, is the oil export center. In 1936, Romania's oil production reached 8.7 million tons. Its oil well development scale is famous in the world. The deepest oil wells reach 2,700 meters, and the shallowest are also 800 meters. However, such rich oil resources brought great disasters to the Romanian people before the war.

    Because the Romanian regime before the war was controlled by the reactionary Bratianu and Maniu partisans, who acted as lackeys of British and American monopoly capital, and sometimes German capital, selling out national resources, the control of Romania's oil industry fell into the hands of international trusts. These monopoly capitals controlled 91 percent of the oil industry's stock. For example, the American-controlled "Romano-Americana" and the Anglo-Dutch "Shell" oil companies all desperately carried out predatory exploitation. In 1936, German capital followed suit and established the so-called "German-Romanian Economic Agreement," competing with British and American capital for plunder. During the four years of the Second World War, Hitler's Germany plundered 13 million tons of oil from Romania. Due to this cruel plunder, coupled with the war, especially bombing, mine engineering equipment suffered severe damage, causing Romania's oil production to drop from 8.7 million tons in 1936 to 3.5 million tons in 1944.

    On March 6, 1945, the Rădescu reactionary government collapsed. The People's Democratic Front, led by the Communist Party, was established, which opened up broad development prospects for Romania's oil industry. However, due to the severe damage of the war and the serious crisis in the national economic situation, industrial production only reached a quarter of the pre-war production level, and the oil industry was therefore greatly restricted, and production once declined.

    However, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, a series of decisive measures such as land reform, currency reform, and industrial nationalization were implemented domestically; at the same time, the Soviet Union provided various kinds of material, technical, and spiritual help and encouragement, and Romania's oil industry, like other industries, quickly embarked on the road of consolidation and development.

    On July 17, 1945, the Soviet Union and Romania established the Soviet-Romanian joint venture oil company "Sovrompetrol." The company's capital totaled 5 billion Romanian lei, and in terms of management, investment, and profit, it was based on the principle of complete equality and mutual benefit.

    In 1948, Romania implemented the nationalization of the oil industry, completely nationalizing companies controlled by British and American monopoly capital. Due to this fundamental change, the production enthusiasm of the Romanian working class rapidly increased, establishing a new attitude towards labor, and the oil production plan was completed ahead of schedule. Oil production exceeded 16 percent of that in 1947. The drilling plan was completed at 103 percent, more than five times higher than before the war. The refining plan was also completed at 100.6 percent, and the oil field survey plan exceeded 30 percent.

    In 1949, Romania's oil production was originally planned to increase by 15 percent, but within six months, "Sovrompetrol's" oil production reached 122.2 percent of the original target. To further increase oil production, on July 4, 1949, the Soviet Union and Romania signed a draft agreement in Bucharest to increase oil production surveys. With this friendly assistance from the Soviet Union, Romania's oil field infrastructure construction last year doubled that of 1948.

    In recent years, representatives of the American "Standard Oil Company" and the British "Royal Dutch Shell," who were deprived of the right to plunder Romanian oil, have been spreading rumors that Romania's oil resources have been exhausted. However, the national economic plan for 1950 proposed by the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Council of Ministers stipulates that the total output of Romanian industry will increase by 37 percent this year, while oil production will increase by 32.5 percent.

    The rapid development of Romania's oil industry reflects that Romania is undergoing a high degree of industrialization, thereby accelerating the process of moving towards socialism.

　　罗马尼亚的石油工业
    胡思升
    罗马尼亚石油的产量，占全世界第五位。在国内经济生活中，石油工业居于极重要的地位。罗马尼亚的全部动力机构，如铁路、发电站、重工业及其他企业所用的燃料，主要是依靠石油。
    蜿蜒于罗马尼亚北部和中部的喀尔巴仟山脉，及境内各山岳地带，都是石油的大量出产地。布加勒斯特以北的普洛埃斯特，则是石油的中心产地。黑海沿岸的康斯坦萨，是石油的输出中心。在一九三六年，罗马尼亚石油的产量，曾达到八百七十万吨。其油井开凿规模之宏大，是世界上有名的。最深的油井达两千七百公尺，顶浅的也有八百公尺。但是，由于这样丰富的石油资源，在战前曾带给罗马尼亚人民以重大的灾难。
    由于战前罗马尼亚政权掌握在反动派勃拉基安奴和曼纽党徒的手里，他们充当着英美独占资本，有时是德国资本的佣仆，出卖国家资源，所以罗国石油工业的控制权，都落入了国际托辣斯之手。这些独占资本控制了石油业股票的百分之九十一。如美孚石油公司实际控制的美罗石油公司、英荷托辣斯合办的“壳牌”石油公司等，都拚命进行了掠夺性的采掘。一九三六年，德国资本接踵渗入，成立了所谓“德罗经济协定”，与英美资本竞相劫掠。在这次大战的四年时间内，希特勒德国曾从罗马尼亚劫走了一千三百万吨石油。由于这种残酷的掠夺，再加上战争尤其是轰炸，矿井工程设备遭受了严重的破坏，使罗马尼亚的石油产量从一九三六年的八百七十万吨降至一九四四年的三百五十万吨。
    一九四五年三月六日，拉德斯古反动政府倒台。以共产党为首的人民民主阵线成立，虽给罗马尼亚石油工业开拓了广大的发展前途，但由于战争的严重破坏，国家经济情势存在着严重的危机，工业生产仅达到战前生产水平的四分之一，石油工业因而亦受到极大限制，产量亦曾一度下降。
    但是，在罗国工人党领导之下，在国内实行了土地改革，币制改革和工业国有化等一连串决定性的措施；同时苏联在物质上、技术上和精神上又予以种种帮助与鼓励，罗马尼亚石油工业，如同其他工业一样，很快的走上了巩固发展的道路。
    一九四五年七月十七日，苏联和罗马尼亚创办了两国合营的石油公司“苏夫罗姆石油”公司。这个公司的资本共五十亿罗币，在管理、投资及利润等方面，都是基于完全平等互利的原则的。
    一九四八年罗马尼亚实行了石油工业国有化，将英美独占资本所控制的公司完全收归了国有。由于这一基本的转变，罗国工人阶级的生产积极性迅速提高，树立起新的劳动态度，石油生产的计划得以提前完成。石油产量超过了一九四七年的百分之十六。钻井计划完成了百分之一百零三，较战前超过五倍。炼油计划亦完成了百分之一百点六，油田勘测计划则超过了百分之三十。
    一九四九年罗马尼亚石油产量原来计划提高百分之十五，但在六个月内，“苏夫罗姆石油”公司的油产量，就达到了原定目标的百分之一百二十二点二。为进一步增加油产量，一九四九年七月四日，苏罗两国在布加勒斯特又签订增加石油产量的勘测草案。在苏联这种友谊的援助下，罗马尼亚去年的油田基本建设工程，较一九四八年增加了一倍。
    近几年来，被剥夺了劫掠罗马尼亚石油权的美国“美孚石油公司”和英国“皇家石油公司”的代表们，在散布着罗马尼亚油源已枯竭的谣言。但是，由罗工人党中央和部长会议所提出的关于一九五○年度的国家经济法案，规定今年罗马尼亚工业的总产量增加百分之三十七，而石油产量则将增加百分之三十二点五。
    罗马尼亚石油工业的迅速发展，反映着罗马尼亚正在高度的工业化，从而加速了走向社会主义的过程。
