　　In its decision on unifying national financial and economic work, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the following appeal to local governments at all levels, all logistics departments, all enterprises, and all factories: "Leaders at all levels should personally take charge of and guide the inventory of warehouses, ascertain all warehouse stocks before the end of June this year, and report them truthfully and level by level to the National Warehouse Material Inventory and Allocation Committee, without concealment or unauthorized transfer. All warehouse materials shall be uniformly allocated and rationally used by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council in order to reduce this year's financial expenditures and orders from abroad."
