Saying an idea, is it better to say it verbosely or concisely? For the convenience of the listener (changing "saying" to "writing," for the convenience of the reader), of course, it's better to say it concisely, as long as the meaning is conveyed without causing misunderstanding. Moreover, concise words are necessarily clean and neat, which is not only a benefit in terms of speaking, but also in terms of thinking. If it's not possible to be concise, that's saying too much, saying what doesn't need to be said. Exaggerating a bit and comparing it to spending money, that's waste.

This time, let me first give some examples of saying too much, to explain my meaning. I apologize that although I have quite a few examples on hand, I don't have the time to classify and study them, and present typical ones for friends to refer to.

(1) It's not to say that the finances of the Northeast region are already smooth sailing... Difficulties are still great, and continued unremitting efforts are needed to overcome them. – May 9th, Second Edition, "Productive and Constructive Northeast Finance"

(2) The leading organization jointly formed by the Trade Union, the Labor Bureau, and the Industry and Commerce Bureau, etc., first explained the policies to both labor and management and mobilized both parties to fully deliberate, and led the formulation of collective contracts. – May 8th, First Edition, "In Several Small and Medium-Sized Cities in North China, Industries Widely Sign Labor-Capital Collective Contracts"

(3) If such a dark and decadent feudalistic marriage system is not thoroughly abolished... then the slogan of equality between men and women and a democratic and free social life cannot be realized, and the mobilization of the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of women cannot be realized. – April 16th, First Edition, Editorial, "Implementing the New Democratic Marriage System"

(4) Recently, due to our poor business performance, we are unable to afford the telephone bill, and have decided to remove the telephone. – April 7th, Sixth Edition, "How to Charge for Telephone Removal"

(5) All expenses of the tram company rely on fare revenue to maintain, so it cannot allow fare evasion, so as not to affect revenue and cause losses to the people's wealth. – April 16th, Sixth Edition, "Honorary Soldiers Must Also Buy Full Fare When Taking the Tram"

(6) In this situation, if there are speculators who dare to take risks and be enemies of the people, they can only wait for the fate of bankruptcy. – June 11th, First Edition, Editorial, "Strive for Complete Price Stability"

(7) The county's supply and marketing cooperative... once collaborated with the special district's supply and marketing head office to open up sales channels with the Northeast. – May 10th, First Edition, "Luan Nan Supply and Marketing Cooperative Widely Signs Textile Contracts to Support Disaster Victims' Spring Planting"

(8) Xin Xin Textile has been in business for more than thirty years... Due to the large organization, complex personnel, and disorganized structure in the past, these have all become burdens today. – May 12th, First Edition, "Seven Yarn Factories of Shanghai Xin Xin System Jointly Form a New Organization"

(9) The reason why it is necessary to publicize the view that prices must be stable is also because when the People's Government is trying to reduce the burden on the people, placing orders with industrialists and farmers and purchasing products, and providing relief to the unemployed and disaster victims, some speculators are maliciously spreading the illusion that prices will rise again. But these illusions are bound to fail, because all these measures of the People's Government are still bounded by maintaining price stability. – June 11th, First Edition, Editorial, "Strive for Complete Price Stability"

Examples (1) and (2) can be discussed together. I think the two instances of "conduct" are unnecessary. In (1), saying "still need unremitting efforts" (even "continue" can be omitted) and in (2), saying "explain the policies to both labor and management" is clear enough. Saying "unremitting efforts" already includes "continue to conduct." "Explaining policies" is doing an action, and since it is being done, it is "conducting," so it doesn't need to be repeated. Considering "explaining policies" as a piece of work (that is, treating it as a noun) and adding a verb "conduct" above it, this kind of statement is inevitably convoluted and redundant.

In example (3), what I want to say is "the mobilization of labor enthusiasm is impossible to realize." Such a statement is somewhat convoluted and redundant; it would be more concise to say "labor enthusiasm is impossible to mobilize." "Labor enthusiasm is impossible to mobilize" means "the mobilization of labor enthusiasm is impossible to realize." Since it's "impossible to mobilize," "mobilization is impossible to realize" is already included in it.

In example (4), "unable to afford the telephone bill" is also a convoluted and redundant statement; saying "unable to afford telephone bill" is much more concise.

Examples (5) and (6) can be discussed together. Saying "cannot allow fare evasion," "he can only wait for bankruptcy," is clear and practical. Adding "situation" and "fate" reduces the practicality because "situation" and "fate" are abstract.

Example (7) says the extra "with." If you say it again and think about it, you will definitely not say this "with."

In example (8), "large organization," "complex personnel," and "disorganized structure" are the original situation of Xin Xin. Because it is the situation, it will "become today's burden" ("burden" is a metaphorical statement; without metaphor, it is a "suffering burden"). According to the original text, "due to the past… disorganized structure" is a statement indicating the cause. If the cause is indicated, what "has become today's burden"? There's no answer. Investigating here, we know that "due to" is redundant. Removing "due to" fits the meaning the author wanted to say. Also, everyone now understands the meaning of the metaphorical statement "burden," so there's no need to describe it. Adding "difficult" to the description is a bit awkward because simply saying "difficult" doesn't equal "difficult to bear." This "difficult" can very well be removed.

In example (9), what I want to say is "but these illusions are bound to fail." Can illusions still be realized? Saying that speculators' illusions are bound to fail, and then explaining the reason underneath, the reason is that the People's Government's measures "are still bounded by maintaining price stability." It's as if without this reason, the speculators' illusions might be realized. In fact, the meaning of "bound to fail" is already included in "illusion" itself, so there's no need to say more. (Finally, "boundary" also has problems, but because it doesn't belong to the scope of "saying too much," I won't discuss it.)

The opposite of saying too much is saying too little. Of course, saying too little cannot make the meaning clear. Exaggerating a bit and comparing it to spending money, that's stinginess—not using it when it should be used. Now, let me just randomly give some examples to talk about.

(10) The prices of commodities such as cotton and general merchandise will gradually reach the proper and reasonable difference between the producing and selling areas. – June 11th, First Edition, "Prices Turn from Falling to Stabilizing, Wuhan Market Situation Improves"

(11) According to statistics from the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce: In April, the ratio of applications for suspension and closure of businesses to applications for opening businesses was about seven to one. – Ibid.

(12) In raising questions, some units also expressed the erroneous idea that taxation is a troublesome matter... But these problems were finally resolved after full deliberation, organized study, and discussion. – April 8th, Second Edition, "Zhang City Public Enterprises Complete Tax Payment"

(13) I guarantee to organize women and mobilize women to mobilize men to participate in digging the river. – May 10th, First Edition, "Ninghe Women Go to the Fields for Production, Resolving the Contradiction between Spring Planting and River Construction"

(14) In order to improve learning effectiveness... many government agencies and schools have adopted a method that combines top-down leadership emphasis with bottom-up learning awareness. – May 10th, Third Edition, "Six Thousand Cadres in Pingyuan Make Up Cultural Lessons"

(15) Because the branch paid attention to improving Party organizational life, strengthening branch education, and receiving direct help from county and district leaders, it was able to unite all the village's farmers, combine improved technology to consolidate mutual aid organizations, and point out to the broad masses of working people the path of labor mutual aid and production to become rich. – April 22nd, Third Edition, "Improving Technology, Consolidating Mutual Aid: Shanxi Yushe Dazhai Village Branch's Experience in Leading Production"

(16) Therefore, in areas where remnant bandits may carry out sabotage and disruption, all people's armed forces should... pay close attention to all destructive activities of hidden enemies. – June 2nd, First Edition, Editorial, "Lead the Summer Harvest and Summer Planting with All Our Strength"

Examples (10) and (11) both say a little less in the same way. That is, "producing and selling area" and "suspension and closure of business" are not said enough. This cannot be compared to "production and marketing cooperative" and "import and export business." "Production and marketing cooperative" is a cooperative that engages in both production and sales, and "import and export business" is a line of business that does both import and export. "Producing area" and "selling area" are two separate areas—"producing area" and "selling area," and "suspension and closure of business" are two separate matters—"suspension" and "closure," and cannot be combined into one. Or someone will say: "Don't you see a caret there? Using a caret indicates that 'producing' and 'selling' jointly apply to 'area,' and 'suspension' and 'closure' jointly apply to 'business.'" Of course, I understand this principle. But I want to ask: If you read it to someone, how do you pronounce these carets? Also, why must you save saying one "area" and one "business"? The "from falling" in the title of example (10) also says too little; whether you read it or look at it, it always makes you pause.

In example (12), "deliberation, organized study, discussion" also uses carets to save speaking. If you read it out, people will only hear a string of disyllabic words—"deliberation," "organization," "study," "discussion"—and they won't understand the author's original intention. We rely on two carets to speculate, knowing that "deliberation" and "organization" are two different things, and "study" and "discussion" are related to both "deliberation" and "organization," two times two equals four, there are actually four things being said here, which are "deliberation and study," "deliberation and discussion," "organization and study," "organization and discussion." Not to mention not being able to hear clearly, just looking at it, you have to speculate for a while to understand, which is too difficult. I want to advise everyone not to do this (many people like to do this now). This is not concise; it's simply taking care of oneself and not caring about others. But speaking and writing articles can never only take care of oneself.

In example (13), are the participants in digging the river women and men, or only men? "Mobilize" and "motivate" have similar meanings. At first glance, this sentence can easily be understood as calling on women and men to participate in digging the river together. Fortunately, there is a title, and we look at the title (and of course the preceding text) and know that the women have gone "to the fields for production," and only the men are digging the river. Therefore, we determine that this sentence is really "'motivating women' to 'motivate men to participate in digging the river.'" Speaking, there is a "to," and this "to" indicates the relationship. If you write it down and keep this "to," it won't cause people to doubt.

In example (14), what I want to say is "leadership emphasis" and "learning awareness." "Leadership" means leading cadres and leading figures, which is very common now. "Emphasize" what? Emphasize the learning of lower-level cadres and students. So adding "from top to bottom" is not wrong at all. The words below are symmetrical to this. Looking at it from a symmetrical perspective, since the "leadership" above refers to leading cadres and leading figures, the "learning" below should also refer to lower-level cadres and students participating in learning. But this kind of referring method is not yet popular now, and I'm afraid it won't be popular in the future. So "learning awareness" is saying too little; in order to forcibly be symmetrical with the above, the meaning is not made clear. As for "from bottom to top," it is another example of saying too much. Lower-level cadres and students are consciously and willingly learning, how can you say "from bottom to top"? This is difficult to understand.

In example (15), "combining improved technology to consolidate mutual aid organizations" is also a string of disyllabic words, the same as in example (12). This sentence forcibly omits the words expressing relationships, the same as in example (13). Changing it to "combining improved technology and consolidating mutual aid organizations" would be clear. Also, consider the title of this example. It is clearly "consolidating mutual aid organizations," but the title omits "organizations." "Mutual aid" and "mutual aid organizations" are different and cannot be used casually. Sacrificing content for the sake of formal symmetry is inappropriate, whether speaking or writing.

The last example also omits a word expressing the relationship, and the function of "hidden" is not clear. It can be seen as an adjective or a verb. If you see it as a verb, the problem is big, and you can understand the original meaning in the opposite way. In fact, naturally, you won't understand it in the opposite way. But, for the sake of making it clear, why not say "hidden '的' enemies" according to our speaking habits, and determine "hidden" as an adjective?

　　多说跟少说
    叶圣陶
    说一个意思，说得噜苏些好呢，还是说得简捷些好？为听的人方便（说换成写，为看的人方便），当然说得简捷些好，只要传达了那个意思，不至于叫人家误会。而且简捷的话必然干净利落，这不单是说话方面的好处，也是思路方面的好处。如果不能够简捷，那就是多说，说了不必说的。夸张些把花钱来打比，那就是浪费。
    这一回先举些个多说的例子，把我的意思说一说。抱歉的是手头虽然有不少的例子，可没有工夫分类研究，提出典型来，供朋友们参考。
    （一）并不是说，东北区的财政已经是一帆风顺，……困难依然是很大的，还需要继续进行不懈的努力才能克服。——五月九日第二版《生产建设性的东北财政》
    （二）工会、劳动局、工商局等联合组成的领导机构，事先向劳资双方进行解释政策并发动双方充分酝酿，并领导制定集体合同。——五月八日第一版《华北若干中小城市行业，广泛签订劳资集体合同》
    （三）这样黑暗腐朽的封建主义的婚姻制度如不彻底废除，……则男女平等的口号和民主自由的社会生活是不可能实现的，广大妇女群众的劳动积极性的发扬是不可能实现的。——四月十六日第一版社论《实行新民主主义的婚姻制度》
    （四）近因我们营业不振，对电话费无力负担，决定将电话机拆除。——四月七日第六版《电话拆机如何收费》
    （五）电车公司一切开支，依赖票款收入来维持，所以不能允许无票乘车的情况，以免影响收入，使人民财富遭到损失。——四月十六日第六版《荣誉军人乘电车也要买足票》
    （六）在这种情况下，如果有投机家敢于冒险，与人民为敌，他就只有等着破产的命运。——六月十一日第一版社论《为物价完全稳定而努力》
    （七）该县供销社……曾协同专区供销总社打通与东北的销路。——五月十日第一版《滦南供销社广泛订立纺织合同，支持灾民春耕播种》
    （八）申新纺织事业经营三十多年。……由于过去机构庞大，人事复杂，组织散漫，都成为今天困难的包袱。——五月十二日第一版《沪申新系七纱厂合组新机构》
    （九）所以需要宣传物价必须稳定的观点，还因为当人民政府正在设法减轻人民的负担，向工业家和农民实行订货和收购产品，并救济失业者和灾民的时候，有些投机家又在恶意地散布物价将从新高涨的幻想。但是这些幻想是要落空的，因为人民政府的这一切措施，仍然是以保持物价稳定为界限的。——六月十一日第一版社论《为物价完全稳定而努力》
    （一）（二）两例可以合起来说。我以为两个“进行”是多说的。在（一）说“还需要不懈的努力”（连“继续”也可以省），在（二）说“向劳资双方解释政策”，就够明白了。说“不懈的努力”已经包含“继续进行”在里头。“解释政策”是做一种行动，既然在做，也就是“进行”了，不必重复说了。把“解释政策”认为一件工作（就是把它看成名词），上头再加上个动词“进行”，这样的说法未免弯曲、累赘。
    在（三）例，我要说的是“劳动积极性的发扬是不可能实现的”。这样的说法弯曲些，累赘些，不如说成“劳动积极性是不可能发扬的”来得简捷。“劳动积极性不可能发扬”就是“劳动积极性的发扬不可能实现”，既然“不可能发扬”，“发扬不可能实现”已经包含在里头了。
    （四）例的“对电话费无力负担”也是弯曲的累赘的说法，说“无力负担电话费”多简捷。
    （五）（六）两例可以合起来说。说“不能允许无票乘车”，“他就只有等着破产”，够明白了，而且切实。加上个“的情况”“的命运”，反而把切实性减轻了，因为“情况”跟“命运”都是抽象性的。
    （七）例多说了个“与”。如果重说一遍，多想一想，决不会说这个“与”。
    在（八）例里，“机构庞大”“人事复杂”“组织散漫”是申新原有的情况。是情况，才会“成为今天的包袱”（“包袱”是比喻说法，不用比喻，就是“受累的负担”）。照原文，“由于过去……组织散漫”是个表明原因的说法。原因表明了，什么东西“都成为今天的包袱”呢？可没有着落。推究到这儿，就知道原来是多说了个“由于”。去掉“由于”，就切合作者要说的意思了。还有“包袱”这个比喻说法，现在大家都了解它的含义，无须形容。给形容上个“困难”倒有些别扭了，因为单说“困难”并不等于“难以负担”。这个“困难”大可以不要。
    （九）例里我要说的是“但是这些幻想是要落空的”。幻想还有能够实现的吗？说投机家的幻想要落空，底下又给说明原因，原因在人民政府的措施“仍然以保持物价稳定为界限”。好像如果没有这个原因，投机家的幻想也许能够实现似的。其实“要落空”的意思已经包含在“幻想”本身里头，不必多说了。（末了儿“界限”也有问题，因为不属于“多说”的范围，不谈了。）
    多说的反面是少说。少说当然不能把意思说清楚。夸张些把花钱来打比，那就是吝啬——当用不用。现在也随便举些个例子来谈谈。
    （十）棉花、百货等商品价格，则逐渐达到产、销区间应有的合理差额。——六月十一日第一版《物价由落转趋平稳，武汉市场情况好转》
    （十一）根据武汉市工商局的统计：四月份全市工商业申请停、歇业与申请开业两者约为七与一之比。
    ——同上
    （十二）在提问题中，有些单位也曾表现了认为税收是件麻烦事……等错误思想。但这些问题经充分酝酿、组织学习、讨论终于得到解决。——四月八日第二版《张市公营企业完成纳税》
    （十三）我保证把妇女组织起来，并发动妇女动员男子参加挖河。——五月十日第一版《宁河妇女下地生产，解决了春耕与河工的矛盾》
    （十四）为了提高学习效果，……许多机关学校采取了自上而下的领导重视和自下而上的学习自觉相结合的方法。——五月十日第三版《平原六千干部补习文化》
    （十五）由于支部注意了健全党内组织生活，加强支部教育，并得到县区领导的直接帮助，因之能够团结全村农民，结合改良技术巩固互助组织，为广大劳动群众指出了劳动互助、生产致富的道路。——四月二十二日第三版《改良技术，巩固互助：山西榆社大寨村支部领导生产经验》
    （十六）因此，在残余土匪可能进行破坏扰乱地区，一切人民武装均应……严密注意隐蔽敌人的一切破坏活动。——六月二日第一版社论《全力领导夏收夏播》
    （十）（十一）两例同样的少说了一点儿。就是“产、销区”“停、歇业”都没有说够。这不能拿“产销合作社”“进出口生意”来比拟。“产销合作社”是一个合作社，干生产又干销售，“进出口生意”是一行生意，做进口又做出口。“产、销区”可硬是两个区域——“产区”跟“销区”，“停、歇业”可硬是两回事情——“停业”跟“歇业”，不能够合并起来说。或者有人要说：“你不看见有个尖点儿在那里吗？用上个尖点儿，就表示‘产’‘销’共同贯到‘区’，‘停’‘歇’共同贯到‘业’。”这个道理我当然明白。可是我要问：如果念给人家听，这些个尖点儿怎么念出来？还有，为什么一定要省说一个“区”一个“业”呢？（十）例的标题里的“由落”也说少了，无论念起来看起来，总要叫你一愣。
    （十二）例里的“酝酿、组织学习、讨论”也是利用尖点儿省说话。如果念出来，人家只听见一连串的双音词——“酝酿”“组织”“学习”“讨论”，搞不清作者的原意。咱们凭两个尖点儿来揣摩，才知道“酝酿”跟“组织”是两回事，“学习”跟“讨论”又是关合“酝酿”跟“组织”的两回事，二二得四，这里头实际说了四回事，就是“酝酿学习”“酝酿讨论”“组织学习”“组织讨论”。且不说听不清楚，单说看，必须揣摩一会才了解，也太难了。我要劝大家不要这么办（现在很有人喜欢这么办）。这不是简捷，简直是只顾自己，不顾别人。可是说话写文章是决不能只顾自己的。
    在（十三）例里，参加挖河的是妇女跟男子呢，还是只有男子？“发动”跟“动员”意思差不多，骤然一看，这句话很可以了解成号召妇女跟男子一同去参加挖河。幸而有个标题在，咱们看了标题（当然还有上文），知道妇女“下地生产”去了，挖河的只有男子。因此断定这句话实在是“‘发动妇女’去‘动员男子参加挖河’”。说起来有个“去”，这个“去”表明了关系。如果写下来也保留这个“去”，就不至于叫人疑惑了。
    在（十四）例里，我要说的是“领导重视”跟“学习自觉”。“领导”就是领导干部、领导人物，现在很通行的了。“重视”什么？重视下级干部跟学生的学习。所以加上个“自上而下”，一点没有错。底下的话是跟这个对称的。用对称的看法看，上头的“领导”既然指领导干部、领导人物，底下的“学习”也该指参加学习的下级干部跟学生。可是这样的指称方法现在还没有通行，恐怕将来也不会通行。所以“学习自觉”是少说了话，为了硬要跟上头对称，没有把意思说清楚。至于“自下而上”又是多说的例子。下级干部跟学生自觉的乐意学习，怎么说“自下而上”呢？这是难以想通的。
    （十五）例里的“结合改良技术巩固互助组织”又是一连串的双音词，跟（十二）例相同。这个话硬把表示关系的词省去了，跟（十三）例相同。改作“把改良技术和巩固互助组织结合起来”，就清楚了。再说这个例子的标题。明明是“巩固互助组织”，可是标题把“组织”省去了。“互助”跟“互助组织”不同，不能随便。为了形式的对称牺牲内容，无论说话写文章，都是不应该的。
    末了一个例子也为少说了一个表示关系的词，“隐蔽”的作用就不明确，可以把它看成个形容词，也可以把它看成个动词。如果把它看成个动词，毛病可大了，正好把原意了解得相反。事实上自然不至于了解得相反的。可是，为说得清楚起见，为什么不按照咱们说话的习惯，说成“隐蔽‘的’敌人”，把“隐蔽”确定作形容词呢？
