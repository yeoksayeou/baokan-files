　　Remembering the Children's Corps Behind Enemy Lines During the Anti-Japanese War
　　Liu Linzhi
　　In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, in the Jin-Cha-Ji Anti-Japanese Base Area behind enemy lines, with the establishment of various mass anti-Japanese organizations, the children widely established their own organization—the Anti-Japanese Children's Corps—under the direct help of the anti-Japanese government led by the Communist Party and the Youth Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. Under the education and call of this organization, the vast number of children participated in supporting the war, production and other work, winning the praise of the masses.
　　At that time, the children participating in the Children's Corps were boys and girls aged seven to fifteen. Each village and district had Children's Corps organizations, and the border area uniformly stipulated the Children's Salute (right hand with five fingers spread out and placed on the upper part of the nose), Children's Hat, Children's Clothes, Children's Stick, and the Five Disciplines of the Children's Corps. When you walk into every village in the border area, you can hear their singing and see Children's Corps members holding red-tasseled spears standing guard under the literacy sign at the entrance of the village, earnestly performing their duties.
　　When the heinous Japanese imperialists carried out a cruel "mopping-up" operation against the border area behind enemy lines, the enemy's biggest headache was not being able to find food and residents, but everywhere there were landmines and the gunshots of the militiamen. The enemy often grabbed children, using all kinds of intimidation and bribery, trying to get some information from the children's mouths. However, many heroic Children's Corps members kept their "Five Nos Movement" firmly in mind: do not tell the enemy a single truth, do not lead the enemy, do not tell the enemy about food and landmines, do not eat the enemy's candy, and do not read the enemy's books. Many children sacrificed heroically for this. For example, the head of a Children's Corps in a village in Pingyang District, Fuping County, was thrown into a burning house by the enemy in 1943 during an anti-mopping-up operation because he refused to tell the enemy about the grain. In the fire, this Children's Corps member shouted, "Down with Japanese imperialism!"
　　In order to prevent enemy spies and traitors from infiltrating the interior of the border area to carry out sabotage, in order to maintain the democratic order of the border area, and in order to use the main labor force for production, the Children's Corps members took on the task of standing guard and keeping watch. At that time, it was often possible to see suspicious people identified by the Children's Corps being sent to the village office or district government. The masses greatly praised the children's serious and responsible spirit. They all said, "These children have also done great things!" In addition, some older Children's Corps members also helped the government deliver newspapers, send letters, and transmit official documents.
　　Assisting the government and the masses in giving preferential treatment to the families of anti-Japanese soldiers was also a task that the Children's Corps members enthusiastically engaged in. They usually helped the families of anti-Japanese soldiers who had no labor to fetch water, sweep the floor, and collect firewood. During the New Year and festivals, the Children's Corps members lined up, carried glorious flags, and sang songs to pay New Year's greetings and give gifts to the families of soldiers. Many anti-Japanese soldiers' families often mentioned the help and respect of the Children's Corps in their letters to their sons or husbands who were fighting the enemy on the front lines, which gave the soldiers great encouragement. In addition, children in the border areas close to enemy territory often disturbed the enemy, making them uneasy day and night. For example, building a pile of earth on the road for motor vehicles and exposing a bit of cloth head often made the enemy's passing cars think it was a landmine and dared not pass, and it took a lot of time to find sappers to dig it up.
　　On the production front, the children were not behind either. Red dates in Fuping and Tangxian areas are one of the important products of the local area. Every spring, a kind of walking beetle that eats jujube leaves and jujube flowers often grows on jujube trees, which affects the yield of red dates. However, the farmers had a superstition that these were "god insects" and could not be completely eliminated. At that time, the children responded to the call of the anti-Japanese government and, with the direct help of primary school teachers, took on the task of publicizing insect control. For example, in Dongchangdian Village, Tangxian County, the Children's Corps members put the insect eggs they dug up in bottles and explained the process of insect eggs turning into walking beetles to the farmers. At first, the masses were still skeptical, but after a few days, the farmers saw with their own eyes that the eggs had turned into insects and began to believe the Children's Corps' words. So the movement to dig up insect eggs spread from one to ten and from ten to a hundred, and no one said they were god insects anymore. In addition to publicizing scientific knowledge, the Children's Corps also actively participated in some minor labor, such as helping their families plant trees, plant seeds, pick leaves, collect firewood, and pick up manure. During the tree planting campaign launched in 1941, many villages planted "Children's Forests." Some had hundreds of trees. Now on both sides of the Shahe and Yanzhi Rivers, the trees planted by the children in those years have become forests. The Children's Corps also carried out a three-elimination campaign, namely, eliminating pests, harmful birds, and harmful rats, because they damaged crops the most severely.
　　The most important task of the Children's Corps was to lead the members in learning. At that time, although the financial economy was very difficult in the areas behind enemy lines, almost every village in the entire border area had a primary school. Without slates, the children used tiles instead, and without chalk, they used lime instead. The children themselves moved bricks and stones to build desks and benches. These children who entered school also used small teachers and half-day systems to teach those children who could not go to school to read.
　　In this way, the Children's Corps became an indispensable force in the Anti-Japanese War and the subsequent People's Liberation War, and cultivated many outstanding talents. This is a period of history that Chinese children and teenagers are proud of.

　　记抗日战争时期敌后的儿童团
    刘林之
    抗日战争的初期，在晋察冀敌后抗日根据地，随着各种群众抗日组织的建立，在共产党领导的抗日政府和青年抗日救国会的直接帮助下，普遍地建立了广大儿童自己的组织——抗日儿童团。就在这个组织的教育与号召下，广大儿童们参加了支援战争、生产等工作，博得群众的赞扬。
    当时参加儿童团的是七岁至十五岁的男女儿童。每个村庄和区都有儿童团的组织，并由边区统一规定了儿童礼（右手五指岔开放在鼻子上边）、儿童帽、儿童衣、儿童棍和儿童团的五大纪律。你走进边区每一个村庄时，都可以听到他们的歌声，看到一个个手持红樱枪在村头识字牌下站岗的儿童团员，他们正在认真地执行着他们的职务。
    当万恶的日本帝国主义对敌后边区进行残酷的“大扫荡”时，敌人最感头痛的是找不到粮食和居人，而到处却是地雷和民兵们放出的枪声。敌寇们常常抓住儿童，用尽威吓利诱的手段，想从儿童们的口中得到一些消息。但许多英勇的儿童团员们牢记着他们的“五不运动”：不告诉敌人一句实话，不给敌人带路，不告诉敌人粮食和地雷，不吃敌人的糖果，不念敌人的书。不少儿童并为此而壮烈牺牲。如阜平县平阳区一个村儿童团长，在一九四三年反扫荡时，因为拒绝告诉敌人粮食，被敌人扔到正在燃烧着的房子里。在火堆中，这位儿童团员还高呼着“打倒日本帝国主义！”
    为了防止敌探、汉奸混入边区内地进行破坏，为了维持边区的民主秩序，为了把主要劳动力用到生产上去，儿童团员们担负了站岗放哨的任务。当时，经常可以看到被儿童团查出的可疑的人被送到村公所或区政府去。群众对儿童这种认真负责的精神是非常赞许的。都说：“这群孩子也办了大事啊！”另外一些年纪大一些的儿童团员，还帮助政府送报纸、送信件，传递公文。
    协助政府和群众优待抗日军人家属，也是儿童团员们热心从事的工作。他们平时帮助没有劳动力的抗日军人家属们打水、扫地、捡柴。过年过节的时候，儿童团员们就排着队、打着光荣旗、唱着歌，给抗属们拜年、送礼物。许多抗属给前方正在与敌人作战的儿子或丈夫的信中，常常提到儿童团对他们的帮助与尊敬，给与战士们很大鼓励。另外，边沿区接近敌人地带的儿童们，还常常扰乱敌人使敌人昼夜不安。例如在汽车路上堆一个土堆，再露出一点布条头，常使过路的敌人汽车认为是地雷，不敢通过，要花费很多时间找工兵来挖它。
    在生产战线上，儿童们也不落后。阜平、唐县一带的红枣是当地重要的出产品之一，每年春天枣树上常生长着一种吃枣叶、枣花的步曲虫子，影响红枣的产量。但农民有一种迷信，说这是“神虫”，不能除尽。当时儿童们就响应抗日政府的号召，在小学教员的直接帮助下，负起了宣传打虫的任务。如唐县东长店村，儿童团员们把挖到的虫卵装在瓶子里，给农民们讲解虫卵变步曲虫的过程。开始时群众还是将信将疑，但几天之后，农民亲眼看到卵变成了虫，开始相信儿童团的话了，于是一传十、十传百地就展开了挖虫卵运动，再没有人说是什么神虫了。儿童团除了宣传科学知识外，还积极参加了一些轻微的劳动，如帮助家中植树、点种、采树叶、打柴、拾粪等。一九四一年开展的植树运动中，许多村庄种植了“儿童林”。多的有几百棵。现在沙河、胭脂河两岸，当年儿童们种的树，已经蔚然成林了。儿童中还开展了除三害运动，即除害虫、害鸟、害鼠，因为它们损坏农作物最厉害。
    儿童团最主要工作是领导团员学习。当时在敌后地区，虽然财政经济很困难，但全边区差不多每个村庄都有一所小学校。没有石板，儿童们就用瓦片来代替，没有石笔粉笔就用石灰代替。儿童们自己去搬砖头石块来砌成桌凳。这些入校的儿童，还用了小先生、半日制等办法去教那些不能上学的儿童识字。
    就是这样，儿童团成为了抗日战争和以后的人民解放战争中一支不可少的力量，而且培养锻炼出了许多优秀的人材。这是中国的少年儿童们值得骄傲的一段历史。
