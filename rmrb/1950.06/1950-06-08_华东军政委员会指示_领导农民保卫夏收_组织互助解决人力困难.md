　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd: The East China Military and Political Committee issued "Instructions Regarding the Summer Harvest and Summer Planting" on May 30th. The instructions pointed out that the total planting area of wheat and barley in the East China region is approximately 120 million mu. The harvest of rapeseed, peas, and other spring-ripening crops, as well as important cash crops such as tea, are also largely during this time. Therefore, the instructions require governments at all levels in East China to vigorously lead the masses of farmers to strive to protect the summer harvest, protect grain and granaries, and complete the tasks of the summer harvest and summer planting. It is necessary to prevent in advance all illegal actions by bandits and special agents who incite disaster victims to seize wheat and grain and disrupt production. Those bandits and special agents who are found to be factual should be arrested and dealt with according to the law (but it is strictly forbidden to beat, kill, or arrest people indiscriminately). Local garrisons should earnestly implement the orders to protect the summer harvest. In order to solve the problem of labor shortages during the summer harvest and summer planting period, while also paying attention to flood prevention, the instructions require local governments to guide the masses of farmers to adopt various possible methods of mutual assistance such as working together, sharing labor, and exchanging labor, in order to give full play to the role of manpower, animal power, and agricultural implements. All localities must also pay attention to solving the difficulties of the summer harvest for the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as widowers, widows, orphans, and the disabled who lack labor and means of production. All levels of leadership organs should actively help the masses in their resident areas to carry out the work of rushing the harvest and rushing the planting. The instructions further require that local governments must prevent both floods and droughts during the summer harvest and summer planting. It is pointed out that the summer flood season is approaching, and all localities must pay attention to inspecting water conservancy projects, organizing flood prevention forces, and carrying out dike protection and rescue work in a timely manner. In arid areas, attention should be paid to building ponds, digging wells, opening canals, building sluices, and repairing irrigation projects to prevent drought. The instructions finally emphasize that after the summer harvest, farmers should be encouraged to save food and expenses and overcome disasters. In disaster areas, disaster victims should be educated to make long-term plans and prevent continuous disasters. In non-disaster areas, the masses of farmers should also be educated to strive for production and actively prepare for famine.
