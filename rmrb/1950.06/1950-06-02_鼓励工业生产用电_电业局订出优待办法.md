　　Encouraging Industrial Production Electricity Consumption
    Electricity Bureau Formulates Preferential Measures
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Electricity Bureau has overfulfilled many projects in the first quarter of its work. The work for the second quarter has been deployed and communicated at the first session of the staff and workers' representatives' meeting of the bureau. Now all staff and workers are working hard to overfulfill the tasks for the second quarter. The National Electricity Conference requires the Beijing Bureau to keep annual line losses to 23 percent, that is to say: for every 100 kilowatt-hours generated, at least 77 kilowatt-hours should be supplied to users, with a maximum loss of 23 kilowatt-hours. The original target for line losses in the first quarter was 26 percent, but the actual figure reached 20.1 percent. In the first quarter, approximately 2 million kilowatt-hours, equivalent to 2.2 billion yuan, were saved. This achievement has strengthened the confidence of the staff and workers, and the entire bureau is now working hard to reduce line losses.
    Promoting electricity sales is also one of the central tasks of the bureau in the second quarter. The bureau's current power generation capacity has greatly increased, but the daytime electricity sales only account for 45 percent of the possible power supply, and about 73 percent at night. Therefore, promoting electricity sales has become one of the central tasks of the bureau. The number of electricity users in Beijing is gradually increasing. Electricity consumption in March was approximately 3.7 million kilowatt-hours, in April it was slightly over 4 million kilowatt-hours, and in May, there are already large users starting to expand their electricity capacity. Thus, coupled with some technical improvements and meticulous work, electricity sales will achieve better results. The bureau has now begun to actively visit electricity users, deeply understand their difficulties, and seek solutions. Currently, payment methods have been determined for new installations and capacity increases, which can be flexibly applied without violating business regulations. The bureau's administration and labor union are also studying improvements to the application procedures to provide users with all possible convenience to expand electricity sales. To encourage industrial electricity consumption, the bureau has formulated the following preferential measures: If the average monthly electricity consumption per horsepower exceeds 150 kilowatt-hours but is below 250 kilowatt-hours, the excess kilowatt-hours will be calculated at 95 percent of the electricity price; if it exceeds 250 kilowatt-hours but is below 350 kilowatt-hours, the excess kilowatt-hours will be calculated at 90 percent of the electricity price; and if it exceeds 350 kilowatt-hours, the excess kilowatt-hours will be calculated at 70 percent of the electricity price.

　　鼓励工业生产用电
    电业局订出优待办法
    【本报讯】北京电业局第一季工作中，许多项目都是超额完成的。第二季的工作已在该局第一届职工代表会议上布置传达，现全体职工正为超额完成第二季的任务而努力。全国电业会议中要求北京局全年线路损失为百分之二十三，就是说：每发一百度电，供给用户的电至少应有七七度，损失最多二十三度。该行原定第一季路线损失为百分之二十六，但实际已达到百分之二十点一，第一季少损失约计二百万度，合二十二亿元。这样的成绩坚定了职工的信心，现全局正为减低线路损失而努力。
    推销用电也是该局第二季的中心任务之一。该局现在的发电容量大大增加了，但白日的售电量仅占可能供电量的百分之四十五，夜间约百分之七十三。因此，推销用电，就成为该局当前中心任务之一。北京用电户已在逐渐增加，三月份电力用电约三百七十万度，四月份为四百万度强，五月份已开始有扩充电力的大用户。这样，再加上一些技术方面的改进与细致的工作，售电会有更好的成绩。该局现已开始主动地访问电力用户，深入了解用户的困难，谋得解决途径。目前已确定对新装及增容户交款办法，在不违反营业规章原则下，可灵活运用。对报装手续，该局行政与工会也正研究改进，给用户以一切可能的方便，以扩大售电量度。为了鼓励工业生产用电，该局并已订出如下优待办法：每月每马力平均用电度数超过一百五十度而在二百五十度以下时，其超过度数，照电力电价的百分之九十五计算；超过二百五十度而在三百五十度以下时。其超过度数，照电力电价的百分之九十计算，超过三百五十度时，其超过度数，照电力电价的百分之七十计算。（刘彦林）
