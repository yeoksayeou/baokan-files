　　Celebrating "July 1st"
    Beijing People's Art Theatre to Stage "Victory Train" and "Production Grand Song and Dance"
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] To celebrate the Party's birthday, the Beijing People's Art Theatre will perform the four-act play "Victory Train" and "Production Grand Song and Dance" on July 1st.
    "Victory Train" depicts railway workers offering a newly built train as a gift for "July 1st." However, due to the complacency of some comrades, spies took advantage of the situation and burned the train. After this bloody lesson, everyone corrected their mistakes, strengthened unity, established a vigilance team, and actively engaged in production again. Finally, through the tireless efforts of all workers for seven days and nights, they rebuilt the "Victory Train" as a gift for "July 1st."
    "Production Grand Song and Dance" is adapted from Comrade Xian Xinghai's posthumous work "Production Grand Chorus." The entire piece is divided into four scenes: Spring Plowing, Sowing, Autumn Harvest, and Bumper Year. It will be jointly performed by the theatre's dance troupe, orchestra, and choir of over 150 people. (People's Art Theatre Correspondence Group)

　　庆祝“七一”
    京艺术剧院上演“胜利列车”和“生产大歌舞”
    【本报讯】为庆祝党的生日，北京人民艺术剧院将于七月一日演出“胜利列车”四幕话剧和“生产大歌舞”。
    “胜利列车”是描写铁路工人为“七一”献礼。积极生产造成一辆新车，但由于某些同志思想麻痹，让特务钻了空子烧毁了车辆。经过这次血的教训，大家改正了毛病，搞好团结，成立纠察队，又积极生产，终于在全体工人七昼夜不停努力下，又重新造成了“七一”献礼的“胜利列车”。
    “生产大歌舞”是根据冼星海同志遗作“生产大合唱”改编的。全部分为春耕、播种、秋收、丰年四场，由该院舞剧队、管弦乐队、合唱队一百五十余人联合演出。（人民艺术剧院通讯组）
