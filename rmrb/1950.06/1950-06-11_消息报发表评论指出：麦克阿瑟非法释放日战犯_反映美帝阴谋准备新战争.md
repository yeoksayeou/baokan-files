　　News Report Publishes Commentary Pointing Out:
	MacArthur Illegally Releases Japanese War Criminals, Reflecting American Imperialist Conspiracy to Prepare for New War
    【Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th】 TASS, Moscow: Kudryavtsev published an article in the News Report on the 8th titled "MacArthur - Protector of War Criminals."

    The author wrote: MacArthur's fifth directive, issued on March 7, 1950, regarding the release of war criminals before the expiration of their sentences, has aroused the anger of all peace-loving people in the Far East. MacArthur's action once again reflects the aggressive nature of the American Far East policy, which, like the policy it pursues in the West, aims to prepare and launch a new war.

    The author proves the illegality of this directive and points out: Because of this directive, war criminals sentenced for cruel atrocities against personnel of the Allied armed forces have been released in batches. Since MacArthur Headquarters issued the fifth directive, as of May 26, four batches of war criminals have been released, including hardened elements such as General Kato, former commander of the Japanese army stationed in China. Another four war criminals will be released from Sugamo Prison in the first half of June. The "Parole Board" established by MacArthur Headquarters to release war criminals whose sentences have not expired had received 380 applications as of May 15. Currently, preparations are being made to release major war criminals such as Shigemitsu Mamoru whose sentences have not expired.

    Kudryavtsev emphasized that MacArthur had come forward as a protector of Japanese war criminals even before he issued this directive. The author reminds readers of MacArthur's attitude toward the Japanese imperialists' preparation for inhumane bacteriological warfare. MacArthur was the first to come forward to protect those who committed inhumane crimes. As early as the Khabarovsk trial of the organizers of bacteriological warfare, he took pains to hide General Shiro Ishii, who manufactured plagues, in a safe place so that the American world hegemony ambitionists could use his "rich experience."

    At present, just as the US government's policy of reviving Japanese militarism is becoming more and more public and arrogant, MacArthur Headquarters especially feels the need for the services of Japanese war criminals. The anti-Soviet, anti-Chinese political line pursued by the Japanese ruling class, headed by Yoshida's reactionary and revenge-seeking group, is being revived at the same time as Japanese militarism.

    However, the American imperialists have not remembered the lessons of history. Just as they are painstakingly trying to revive Japanese militarism, the people of all Asian nations are unwilling to tolerate American imperialism or the Japanese imperialism it is fostering. The Soviet government's demand to punish Japanese war criminals has been enthusiastically supported by millions of people in all countries who defend world peace and security.

### 消息报发表评论指出：麦克阿瑟非法释放日战犯  反映美帝阴谋准备新战争

　　消息报发表评论指出：
    麦克阿瑟非法释放日战犯  反映美帝阴谋准备新战争
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：库德里雅夫契夫于八日在消息报上发表一篇以“麦克阿瑟——战犯的庇护者”为题的论文。
    作者写道：麦克阿瑟在一九五○年三月七日发表的关于在徒刑满期之前释放战犯的第五号指令，已引起远东一切和平拥护者的愤怒。麦克阿瑟的这一行动，再度反映了美国远东政策的侵略本质，这个政策与它在西方所遵循的政策一样，旨在准备和发动新战争。
    作者证明这个指令的非法性，并指出：由于这个指令，那些因对盟国武装部队人员施以残酷暴行而判处徒刑的战犯，已被整批整批地释放了。自麦克阿瑟总部发表第五号指令以来，到五月二十六日为止，已有四批战犯获释，其中包括像前驻中国日军指挥官加藤将军那样的死硬分子。另外的四名战犯，将在六月上半月自巢鸭监狱释放。麦克阿瑟总部为释放刑期未满的战犯而设立的“假释委员会”，到五月十五日为止，已收到三百八十件申请书。目前，正准备释放像重光葵这类刑期未满的首要战犯。
    库德里雅夫契夫强调指出：麦克阿瑟早在他发表这一指令之前，就出面来作日本战犯的保护人了。作者提醒读者注意麦克阿瑟对日本帝国主义者准备不人道的细菌战争的态度。麦克阿瑟首先出面庇护那些犯不人道的罪行的人们。早在伯力审判细菌战组织者的时候，他就劳神把石井四郎这样制造瘟病的将军窝藏在稳当的地方，以便美国的世界霸权的野心家能利用他的“丰富的经验”。
    在目前，正当美国政府重新复活日本军国主义的政策逐渐公开化并越来越傲慢的时候，麦克阿瑟总部尤其感觉到需要日本战犯的效劳了。以吉田的反动而急求报复的集团为首的日本统治阶级所推行的反苏联、反中国的政治路线，正与日本军国主义同时被复活着。
    但是，美国帝国主义者没有记住历史的教训。正当他们处心积虑地来复活日本军国主义的时候，亚洲各族人民并不愿容忍美国帝国主义或其所正在扶植的日本帝国主义。苏联政府惩处日本战犯的要求，得到了各国千百万保卫世界和平与安全的人民的热烈拥护。
