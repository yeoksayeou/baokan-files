    Resolutely Suppress Secret Agents

    The Public Security Bureau of this city's People's Government, having accepted the accusations and denunciations of the people, has arrested a group of extremely wicked secret agent elements within two days. This is of important help in consolidating the revolutionary order of this city and protecting the safety of the lives and property of the people of this city.

    The secret agent elements arrested this time are of three types: one type is the notorious secret agent bandits who appear as leaders of the reactionary Yiguandao. The Yiguandao is a reactionary superstitious organization controlled by secret agents. The Yiguandao ringleaders arrested this time, such as Liu Xieyuan, are all Japanese secret agents and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang secret agents with obvious crimes. During the period of Japanese puppet rule and the period of Kuomintang bandit gang rule, they used preaching as a cover to actively carry out anti-people activities, massacre revolutionary patriots, extort and blackmail, and do everything. Within the Yiguandao, they implemented feudal rule, exploited and abused their "Dao members" in various ways, even raping young girls and seizing other people's wives. The former North China People's Government issued General Secret Order No. 2, ordering that "all organizations of secret societies and Dao sects should be dissolved immediately and must not engage in any further activities." Liu Xieyuan and other chief culprits dared to despise the laws of the People's Government and have been carrying out counter-revolutionary activities since the liberation of Beijing, spreading rumors, sabotaging production, and disrupting social order. The People's Government, after repeated warnings to them proved ineffective, decided to arrest them. Another type is secret agent elements who continue to operate under the guise of surrender. They had hypocritically gone through the registration procedures with the public security organs of the People's Government, but they were unrepentant, outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant, and refused to hand over reactionary organizations and their documents and weapons. During their detention and training by our public security organs, they continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, conduct counter-revolutionary propaganda, and even hide weapons, plotting wrongdoing. Still another type is secret agent elements who have not surrendered and continue to operate. They are directed by the remnant groups of the Chiang bandits, lurking in the people's capital, and have consistently refused to register. They spy on intelligence, organize armed robbery and sabotage, and print counterfeit money to disrupt finance. Some have also infiltrated the production departments of the troops and organs, using money and beautiful women to seduce cadres, attempting to hide for a long time and establish strongholds for secret agent activities.

    In order to protect the interests of the state and the people, the People's Government must not allow these secret agent elements to continue their anti-people criminal activities. Article 7 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "Suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, and severely punish all Kuomintang war criminals who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause, and other die-hard counter-revolutionary chief culprits." The Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau resolutely implemented this policy of combining leniency and suppression. After the liberation of Beijing, the People's Government Public Security Bureau arrested some extremely wicked secret agent elements in accordance with the law. Among them, some are still in custody and education; some have already engaged in production and are being reformed through labor. At the same time, it ordered other secret agent elements to register with the public security organs and hand over illegal organizations, documents, radio stations, and weapons. And it implemented a certain period of detention and training for the registered secret agent elements in order to promote their awareness and guide them on the road to self-renewal. In the past year, in the capital, more than a thousand registered secret agent elements have repented and renewed themselves under the call of the government's lenient policy. Therefore, the government has lifted the detention and training for them. This fact fully demonstrates that the People's Government is benevolent and righteous, and is willing to save any criminals who can be saved. However, there are still a few obstinate secret agent elements who think that the people can be deceived and continue to do evil. They should understand that the Chiang bandits' last nest and the last stronghold of American imperialism, the Chiang bandits' master, in its aggression against China—Taiwan—will soon be liberated, the Chiang bandits will be completely destroyed, and the American imperialist aggression against China will be completely defeated. If they do not bow their heads to the people, they will only have a dead end. The People's Government has full determination and strength to punish them.

    The People's Government's arrest of these chief culprits of counter-revolution not only has the support of the broad masses of the people, but will also surely promote the sudden awakening of those who have been coerced and deceived by these chief culprits of counter-revolution and led astray, and prompt them to break away from the shackles of reactionary organizations and seek opportunities for repentance and self-renewal.

    The reactionaries will not be reconciled to death. They will still come up with various methods to continue to carry out sabotage activities. The secret agent elements uncovered this time have even infiltrated the production departments of the People's Liberation Army troops and the People's Government organs, and have not been discovered by the organs for a considerable period of time. This should arouse our serious vigilance. We must point out that bureaucracy and carelessness often give secret agent elements an opportunity to take advantage of; the corrupt and pleasure-seeking thoughts and behaviors of certain cadres often become the medium for secret agent elements to invade. Therefore, we should cooperate with the upcoming movement to rectify the work style of cadres, and in the struggle against the erroneous tendencies of bureaucracy, commandism, corruption and embezzlement, improve the people's security system and eliminate all possible loopholes for secret agent elements to harm the people's cause.

### 坚决镇压特务

　　坚决镇压特务
    本市人民政府公安局接受人民的控告与揭发，于两日内逮捕了一批罪大恶极的特务分子。这对于巩固本市的革命秩序，保卫本市人民生命财产的安全，有重要的帮助。
    这次被捕的特务分子有三种：一种是以反动的一贯道首领出现的著名的特务匪徒。一贯道是被特务操纵的反动迷信组织，这次被捕的一贯道首脑刘燮元等都是罪恶昭彰的日本特务和蒋介石匪帮的特务。在日伪统治时期和在国民党匪帮统治时期，他们以传教为掩护，积极进行反人民的活动，残杀革命志士，敲诈勒索，无所不为。他们在一贯道内部，实行封建的统治，多方剥削和虐待他们的“道亲”，甚至强奸幼女，霸占人妻。前华北人民政府曾颁布总秘字第二号命令，限令“所有会门道门组织，应即一律解散，不得再有任何活动”。刘燮元等首恶分子，胆敢蔑视人民政府法令，从北京解放迄今，一直进行反革命活动，散布谣言，破坏生产，扰乱社会秩序。人民政府对于他们，在屡诫无效之后，乃决定将其逮捕。另一种是假自首而继续活动的特务分子。他们曾经虚伪地向人民政府公安机关履行过登记手续，但是他们怙恶不悛，阳奉阴违，拒绝交出反动组织及其证件和武器。在被我公安机关管训期间，竟继续进行反革命活动，从事反革命宣传，甚至私藏武器，图谋不轨。还有一种是迄未自首而继续活动的特务分子。他们受蒋匪残余集团指使，潜入人民的首都，始终拒绝登记。他们刺探情报，组织武装抢掠与破坏，并印制假钞，扰乱金融。有的还潜入部队、机关的生产部门，以金钱美女诱惑干部，妄图长期隐蔽，建立特务活动的据点。
    人民政府为了保护国家、人民的利益，决不能容许这些特务分子继续其反人民的罪恶活动。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第七条规定：“镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子”。北京市人民政府公安局，坚决执行了这一宽大与镇压相结合的政策。北京解放后，人民政府公安局依法逮捕了一些罪大恶极的特务分子。其中，有些尚在羁押和教育；有些已从事生产，从劳动中改造。同时，限令其他特务分子向公安机关登记，交出非法的组织、证件、电台、武器。并对已登记的特务分子，实行一定时期的管训，以便促使他们觉悟，引导他们走上自新之路。一年以来，在首都，已有一千多名登记了的特务分子，在政府宽大政策的号召下，悔过自新了。因此，政府已对他们解除了管训。这种事实，充分说明了人民政府仁至义尽，愿意挽救任何可以挽救的犯罪分子。但是，还有少数执迷不悟的特务分子，以为人民可欺，继续为非作恶。他们应该懂得，蒋匪的最后巢穴和蒋匪的主子美国帝国主义侵略中国的最后据点——台湾，不久即将解放，蒋匪就要完全灭亡，美帝国主义对中国的侵略就要最后地全军覆没了。他们如果再不向人民低头，就只有死路一条。人民政府有充分的决心和力量来惩罚他们。
    人民政府逮捕了这些反革命的首恶分子，不仅得到广大人民的拥护，而且必将促使这些反革命首恶所胁迫欺骗而误入歧途的分子翻然觉悟，促使他们摆脱反动组织的束缚，求得悔过自新的机会。
    反动派是不会甘心死亡的。他们还会想出各种方法，继续进行破坏活动。这次所破获的特务分子竟有潜入人民解放军部队、人民政府机关的生产部门活动，而在相当长时期内，未被该机关所发觉。这应该引起我们严重的警惕。我们必须指出：官僚主义、粗心大意，常给特务分子以可乘之机；某些干部腐化享乐的思想与行为，常常成为特务分子侵入的媒介。因此，我们应该配合即将开始的整顿干部作风的运动，在和官僚主义、命令主义、贪污腐化的错误倾向斗争中，健全人民保安制度，杜绝特务分子危害人民事业的一切可能的罅隙。
