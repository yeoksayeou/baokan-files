　　Helping Farmers Overcome the Lean Season
    Anguo County Actively Loans and Exchanges Coarse Grains
    [Report from Anguo] The Anguo County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in order to solve the difficulties faced by farmers during the lean season and ensure stable wheat prices, has made considerable progress by providing loans and exchanging coarse grains with farmers through contract agreements. Starting from May 19th, all cooperative cadres in the county mobilized to the villages, utilizing evenings and midday breaks to hold meetings with village cadres and mass rallies. Using comparative methods, they explained the significance of exchanging coarse grains for fine grains, breaking the loose thinking of "harvesting wheat and eating wheat." Street poetry, blackboards, and radio stations all cooperated in the propaganda, calling on everyone to be creditworthy and sign contracts. They adopted the method of pre-investigation, examination during exchange, and post-exchange inspection to lend and exchange coarse grains to farmers who truly lacked grain, preventing loafers and lazy people from "fishing in troubled waters and eating first, then talking." In ten days, eighty-five contracts were signed in eighty-two villages, exchanging a total of 468,175 jin of sorghum to cooperative members and 39,539 jin to non-members.

　　帮助农民度过青黄不接
    安国县积极贷换粗粮
    【本报安国讯】安国县供销社为了解决农民在青黄不接时的困难，保障麦价平稳，通过订合同方式，贷换粗粮给予农民，已作出不少成绩。从五月十九日开始，全县合作干部一齐出动到各村，利用晚饭后和歇晌的时间，召开村干部会和群众大会，用对比方法，说明以粗换细的意义，打破了“收麦吃麦”的散漫思想。街头诗、黑板报、广播台一齐配合宣传，号召大家讲信用、订合同，采用事前调查，换时审查，换后检查的办法，把粗粮借换给真正缺粮的农民，防止了二流子懒汉“混水摸鱼，吃了再说”的打算。十天之中，在八十二个村订立了八十五张合同，共换给社员高粱四十六万八千一百七十五斤、非社员三万九千五百三十九斤。
