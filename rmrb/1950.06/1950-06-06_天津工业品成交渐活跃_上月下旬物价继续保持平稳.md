Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th -- According to the Tianjin Daily, Tianjin's commodity prices continued to remain stable in late May. At the same time, as the wheat harvest approaches and the season for industrial products to go to the countryside is about to arrive, the department store and textile markets are gradually becoming more active.

In late May, the average commodity price index in Tianjin (with December 1949 as 100) was 152.4, a decrease of only 1.2% compared to the middle of the same month. Comparing the end and beginning of the ten-day period for 42 commodities, there was also only a slight decrease of 0.8%. Among them, the grain category fell by 6.83%, non-staple food rose by 1.35%, department stores rose by 0.75%, fuel rose by 0.59%, and cotton yarn and cloth rose by 0.07%. These figures show that, except for a slight drop in grain prices, the prices of industrial products, which had fallen too much in the previous period, have slightly rebounded.

The reason for the slight drop in grain prices is mainly because the wheat harvest is approaching, and those with grain in storage are eager to sell, while buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude; moreover, both coarse and fine grains continue to be transported in. The total sales volume of grain in the ten-day period accounted for only 65.85% of the amount on the market, showing a phenomenon of supply exceeding demand. Although the grain company had appropriately lowered the listed price, the gap between the market price and the listed price was still large, and further adjustments are still needed.

In the department store category, also due to the wheat harvest, private merchants are preparing to promote sales in large quantities, and the number of organizations and cooperatives from various places coming to Tianjin to purchase is also increasing day by day, and transactions are gradually becoming more active. Among them, the prices of caustic soda and sugar continue to rise; the peak sales season for sugar has arrived, and private merchants once took the opportunity to drive up prices, with a sudden increase in prices at the beginning of the ten-day period, which was only calmed down after state-owned trading organizations supplied a large quantity. Sales of soap and pigments have also developed; knitwear, matches, cigarettes, etc. are all stable.

In the cotton yarn and cloth category, the demand for cotton yarn by the weaving and knitting industries has increased, and merchants from the Northwest, Northeast, and surrounding areas of Tianjin have also come to Tianjin to purchase, and transactions are becoming increasingly active. The cotton yarn and cloth company supplies steadily, and the price of yarn remains stable. The listed price for this ten-day period has not changed, and the market price has also changed very little. Sales of cotton cloth are not large, and less cotton has been sold than in mid-May.

### 天津工业品成交渐活跃  上月下旬物价继续保持平稳

　　天津工业品成交渐活跃
    上月下旬物价继续保持平稳
    【新华社天津四日电】据天津日报载称：天津市五月下旬物价继续保持平稳。同时，由于麦收已届，工业品下乡的季节即将来到，百货及纺织品市场渐见活跃。
    五月下旬，津市物价平均指数（以一九四九年十二月为一○○）为一五二点四，较同月中旬仅下落百分之一点二。四十二种商品旬末和旬初相较，亦仅微落百分之零点八。其中粮食类下落百分之六点八三，副食品类升百分之一点三五，百货类上升百分之零点七五，燃料类升百分之零点五九，花纱布类升百分之零点零七。这些数字说明：除粮价稍有下落外，前一个时期跌落得过多的工业品价格均略略回升。
    粮价稍有下落的原因，主要是由于麦收已届，存粮者急于销出，买方则观望不前；而且粗、细粮食续有运进。全旬粮食销售量只占上市量的百分之六十五点八五，出现了供过于求的现象。粮食公司虽曾将牌价适当降低，但市价与牌价距离仍大，尚需继续加以调整。
    百货类亦因麦收关系，私商多准备大量推销，各地机关、合作社来津采购者亦日见增多，成交逐渐活跃。其中火碱和糖货价格续升；糖货实销季节已到，私商曾一度乘机哄抬，旬初价格突升，后经国营贸易机关大量供应，方告平息。肥皂及颜料销路均有开展；针织品、火柴、纸烟等均呈平稳。
    花纱布类的棉纱因织布和针织两业需用量增多，西北、东北和津市四周各地客商亦多来津采购，成交日渐活跃。花纱布公司源源供应，纱价保持平稳，本旬牌价未动，市价变动亦甚轻微。棉布销路不大，棉花较中旬销出亦少。
