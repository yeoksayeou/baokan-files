　　Attention to the Health of Railway Workers
    Zou Zhaoxian, Xiao Wu's suggestions to the Taiyuan Railway Bureau
    I am an engineer who recently came from the South, and I have been working in the Line Section of the Engineering Department of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau for a short time. I have noticed that the bureau's newspaper publishes accident reports of drivers passing signals on every issue. I think this is a very serious matter. I previously guessed it was due to the driver's poor skills or insufficient training; after investigation, I discovered that the drivers' and stokers' lack of physical strength and poor mental state is also a reason.
    On the 4th of this month, I was sent on a business trip to Jiangcun on the North Tongpu Railway to survey the Shenshan temporary bridge. I rode in the caboose both ways to inspect the route. In the caboose, I twice met drivers and stokers working with the shift, and saw them looking so haggard, dozing off in the cramped caboose. In our conversation, I learned that they were the drivers and stokers assigned to this locomotive. Now, because the turnover rate has increased, the locomotives stay at the depot for a very short time (no more than three hours). Although it is a three-shift, three-eight-hour system (i.e., each shift works eight hours), they rarely have time to rest at home. For example, the passenger train to Jiangcun takes more than ten hours for one trip. Therefore, in addition to the drivers and stokers on duty working on the locomotive, a shift of drivers and stokers must accompany the train each time to take over the driving of this passenger train. This shift of drivers and stokers cannot get a good rest on the train because there is no place to sleep, so their physical strength is not fully recovered after taking over, and they are in a poor mental state. They said: "Many drivers and stokers are getting sick due to insufficient rest and overwork." If this is true, I think this is a big problem for our Taiyuan Railway Bureau. Of course, it is impossible to attach a car for the drivers and stokers to sleep in every time when vehicles are lacking at present. But I think it would not be difficult to separate a compartment with three or four berths or install hammocks in the caboose of each train. I am very willing to assist and participate in this design work. I hope that we can all understand the physical and mental health of our fellow workers more, so that our railway can better complete the transportation tasks of 1950.

    The staff of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau were, in the past, subject to long-term exploitation by the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs, and most of them are in poor health. In order to improve traffic efficiency and prevent accidents, the railway leadership organs conducted a physical examination of personnel related to traffic safety in March this year. According to the examination results of the Shijiazhuang Railway Hospital for the railway workers in the Shijiazhuang area alone, among the one thousand and eighty-six personnel (such as drivers, transporters, signalmen, switchmen, etc.) directly related to traffic in stations, transportation sections, locomotive sections, inspection sections, motorcycle teams, dispatching offices, and railway factories, there were forty people suffering from color blindness (red, green); one hundred and eleven people with weak vision in one eye; seven people with weak vision in both eyes; twelve people with poor hearing; seventy-nine people with heart disease; seven people with significant lung disease; and one person with high blood pressure. A total of three hundred and twenty people, accounting for 34% of the total personnel. Although this is not the main reason for the frequent occurrence of accidents, it is not unrelated. However, as of now, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau has not paid further attention to this issue. Therefore, I suggest that the Taiyuan Railway Bureau quickly find ways to pay attention to the physical and mental health of the workers, strengthen sanitation facilities, to ensure better completion of railway transportation tasks.

　　注意铁路工人的健康
    邹兆俭、小兀对太原路局的建议
    我是新由南方来的一个工程师，到太原铁路局工务处线路课工作不久。我看到每期路局报纸都刊登有司机冒进信号的事故。我认为这是一件非常严重的事。我以前猜想是司机技术不良或者是训练不够；经过调查，才发现了司机、司炉的体力不够和精神不济，也是一个原因。
    本月四日，我奉派出差，到北同蒲路蒋村去察勘圣山便桥。往返都是坐在后面的守车上，以便巡视路线。在守车上我两次都遇见了随班工作的司机、司炉，看见他们三个人那样憔悴不堪，坐在狭小的守车上打瞌睡。在我们的互相谈话中，才知道他们是这一个机车随班的司机、司炉。现在因为周转率提高，机车在段上停留的时间甚短（不得超过三小时）。虽然是三班三八制（即每班工作八小时），但是他们很少有在家休息的时候。好比到蒋村的客车，一出动就是在十几小时以上。所以除了当班的司机、司炉在机车上工作外，每次尚须有一班司机、司炉随车，来接替这一次客车的开车工作。这一班司机、司炉因为在车上没有睡的地方，得不到很好的休息，所以接班后他们的体力尚未完全恢复，精神不济。他们说：“现在的司机、司炉因得不到充分休息，过于疲劳而生病的甚多。”若真是这样，我觉得这是我们太原路局的一个很大的问题。当然，在现在本路车辆缺乏的时候，每次要挂一个司机、司炉睡觉的车辆是不可能的。但是我想：在每个列车的守车上隔一间三四个人的铺位或安装吊床，是不难办到的。我很愿意从旁协助参加这一种设计工作。我更希望我们大家要多多体会到工友们的心身健康，使本路能更好完成一九五○年的运输任务。

    太原铁路局职工，过去在蒋阎匪帮长期压榨下，大部分身体欠健康。铁路领导机关为了提高行车效率，防止事故，于今年三月间，曾对有关行车安全人员进行了一次生理检查。仅根据石家庄市铁路医院对石家庄区铁路工人的检查结果来看，车站、运输段、机务段、检车段、摩托车队、调度所、铁路工厂等直接有关行车的人员（如司机、运输员、号志员、转辙工等）一千零八十六人中，计患色盲（赤、绿）者四十人；一眼弱视者一百一十一人；二眼弱视者七人；听力不良者十二人；心脏病者七十九人；肺病显著者七人；高血压者一人。共计三百二十人，占全体人员百分之三十四。这虽不是屡次发生事故的主要原因，但也不无关系。但截至目前为止，太原路局对此问题还没有更进一步的注意。因此我建议太原铁路局赶快设法注意工友们的身心健康，加强卫生设备，以保证铁路运输任务的更好完成。
