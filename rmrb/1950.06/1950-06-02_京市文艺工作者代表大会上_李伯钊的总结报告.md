　　Li Bozhao's Summary Report at the Beijing Municipal Literary and Art Workers Representative Conference
　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] At the Beijing Municipal Literary and Art Workers Representative Conference, Li Bozhao's summary report of the conference is as follows:
　　Fellow Representatives! Esteemed Guests! I am honored and excited to deliver the summary of the conference on behalf of the presidium!
　　This Beijing Municipal Literary and Art Workers Representative Conference has lasted for four days. Everyone agrees with the basic spirit of the report. All are willing to carry out popularization work in Beijing. In the representatives' speeches and discussions, many supplementary opinions were put forward, enriching the content of our report. Everyone's thinking is consistent, clarifying the future direction of work, and unanimously agreeing to implement the policy of prioritizing literary and artistic popularization, and to complete the task of popularizing literature and art in Beijing through action. All literary and art workers in Beijing have united under a clear policy. This is the main gain of this conference. With this common goal and a sound organization, mobilizing the strength of all literary and art workers in the city, we will definitely be able to complete future tasks.

  In the conclusion, I want to talk about three issues:

　　I. Factory Literary and Art Work: How do we continue to carry out factory literary and art work? First, we must clarify the policy of factory literary and art work: to serve the restoration and development of production. We must closely cooperate with production and pay attention to resolving the contradictions between literary and art work and production tasks in actual work, to achieve the purpose of literary and art work serving production. Second, there must be a sound Factory Literary and Art Work Committee to uniformly lead factory literary and art work. Third, Beijing's literary and art groups or organizations should include guiding factory literary and art as a regular business. Fourth, going to factories should have a clear purpose, to delve into life, to become one with the workers, to help the workers, and to jointly create educational works that promote enthusiasm for productive labor. Fifth, vigorously cultivate the backbone of workers' amateur literary and art work and carry out the popularization of factory literature and art.

　　II. The Issue of Opera Reform: First, opera must be reformed. Reform is for "weeding through the old to bring forth the new," and for creating and developing new opera, making opera more suitable for the interests of the broad masses of working people. Second, how to reform? First, we must be led by advanced elements of opera performers, and organize more forces to carry out this work in a planned way. Third, Beijing's opera performers already have advanced activists who are carrying out this reform. For more than a year, the graduates of the opera training class have organized an alumni association, and they have already revised more than 20 revised versions. Director Guo Moruo's speech and Comrade Peng Zhen's speech and instructions on opera reform are correct.

　　III. The Issue of Literature for the Broad Masses of Intellectual Youth and Children: In the past, friends in literary and art circles paid little attention to this issue. The broad masses of intellectual youth and children lack excellent literary readings. We should write more poetry, stories, and novels for children to cultivate and educate our younger generation. Do not forget the flowers that the students and Young Pioneers of Beijing presented to our conference!

　　Literary and art workers in Beijing, we must all use our greatest efforts to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and we must carefully study Chairman Mao's speech at the Forum on Literature and Art. If we do not study and research carefully and use it to guide our literary and art work, it will be like a ship without a rudder. A ship without a rudder will not be able to control its direction.

　　The conference is about to close victoriously. I hope that all representatives will bring the spirit of the conference to their work, and unite all literary and art workers in the city to work together. I believe that in the near future, the popularization of literature and art in Beijing will be rapidly developed.

　　京市文艺工作者代表大会上
    李伯钊的总结报告
    【京市新闻处讯】京市文艺工作者代表大会上，李伯钊的大会的总结报告，全文如下：
    各位代表！各位来宾！我代表主席团来做大会的总结，感到光荣和兴奋！
    这次北京市文代大会开了四天，大家都同意报告的基本精神。一致愿意开展北京市的普及工作，在代表发言和讨论中，提出了不少的补充意见，丰富了我们报告的内容。大家思想一致明确了今后的工作方向，一致同意贯彻文艺普及为第一的方针，而且要用行动来完成北京文艺普及工作的任务。全北京市文艺工作者，在明确的方针下，团结起来了。这是这次大会主要的收获，有了这个共同的目标，有了健全的组织，动员全市文艺工作者的力量，一定能完成今后的任务的。
  在结论中我要谈三个问题
    一、工厂文艺工作：我们怎样来继续开展工厂文艺工作？第一、要明确工厂文艺工作的方针：要为恢复和发展生产而服务。要同生产密切的配合，要注意解决文艺工作同生产任务在实际工作中的矛盾，达到文艺工作服务生产的目的。第二、要有一个健全的工厂文艺工作委员会，统一领导工厂文艺工作。第三、北京各文艺团体或机关，应将辅导工厂文艺列入经常业务之内。第四、下厂工作应有明确的目的，为了深入生活，和工人打成一片，帮助工人，与工人共同创作富有教育意义的，发扬生产劳动热情的作品。第五、用大力培养工人业余文艺工作的骨干，开展工厂文艺普及工作。
    二、戏曲改革工作问题：第一、戏曲必须改革，改革为了“推陈出新”，为了创造发展新的戏曲。使戏曲更加适合于广大劳动人民的利益。第二、如何改革呢？首先要通过戏曲艺人的先进分子来领导，组织更多的力量有计划的进行这种工作。第三、北京市的戏曲艺人已经有了先进的积极分子，已经在进行着这种改革，一年多以来戏曲讲习班的毕业生组织了同学会，他们业已改出二十余种修改本。郭沫若主任的发言和彭真同志关于戏曲改革问题的讲话和指示是正确的。
    三、广大知识青年与少年儿童文学问题：过去文艺界的朋友对这问题很少注意，广大知识青年和少年儿童缺少优秀的文学读物。我们应该多写少年儿童的诗歌，故事，小说来培养教育我们青少年一代。不要忘记北京学生、少年儿童队员给我们大会献的鲜花！
    北京市的文艺工作者，我们大家要用最大的力气来学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，要好好的研究毛主席在文艺座谈会上的讲话。我们如果不用心学习和研究，用它来指导我们的文艺工作，就好像一只船没有舵一样，没有舵的船，是会掌握不住方向的。
    大会即将胜利的闭幕，希望各位代表把大会的精神带到工作中去，团结全市文艺工作者一致努力，我相信不久的将来，北京市文艺普及工作一定会迅速开展起来。
