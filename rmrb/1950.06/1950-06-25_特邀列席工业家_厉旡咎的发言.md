    Speech by Specially Invited Industrialist
    Li Wugui
    [Xinhua News Agency, 24th] Specially invited industrialist Li Wugui's speech at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative on the 22nd, full text as follows: Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Esteemed Members, Ladies and Gentlemen:
    In the eight months since the establishment of the Central People's Government, it has done much for the people. Having listened to the reports from the leaders of the People's Government, we are even more aware of the significant achievements in military, political, diplomatic, and economic affairs. Militarily, all territories except Taiwan and Tibet have been liberated, achieving genuine unity and stability. Diplomatically, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with our advanced ally, the Soviet Union, has incomparably strengthened the global forces of peace and democracy, delivering a heavy blow to the schemes of warmongers. Economically, the unification of national finances has been completed, bringing state revenue and expenditure close to balance and stabilizing currency and prices. These are all unprecedented achievements. Such achievements could only be accomplished under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. We are extremely excited and sincerely grateful to our great leader, Chairman Mao.
    Since liberation, due to the drastic changes in the environment, industrialists and businessmen have encountered varying degrees of difficulty. However, these difficulties are brought about by victory and are only temporary. It should be said that these difficulties are beneficial to us industrialists and businessmen, serving as a necessary medicine for us to transition from abnormal to rational business operations. Having experienced these difficulties, we know that we must transform ourselves.
    After listening to Vice-Chairman Liu's report on land reform, we know that land reform will be basically completed nationwide within three years. After the completion of land reform, agricultural production will increase significantly, and rural purchasing power will greatly improve. After listening to Vice-Premier Chen's financial and economic report, we know that the Central People's Government has more explicit instructions and reasonable considerations regarding the adjustment of industry and commerce and taxation issues. This shows that the Central People's Government is laying a good foundation for industry and commerce and creating conditions for development.
    However, if industry and commerce do not transform themselves and only rely on the government, they will not be able to overcome difficulties. If our organizations are bloated, they should be streamlined and strengthened. We must not only increase production but also be meticulous in our calculations and overcome waste. We must trust and rely on workers, establishing new labor-capital relations that are equal, democratic, contractual, and mutually beneficial. We should abide by the Common Program, and under the leadership of the state-owned economy, cooperate to complete the task of restoring and developing production. We must first make efforts ourselves before we can receive the government's care, overcome difficulties, and seek future development.
    I come from Wuhan and would like to report on the general situation of industry and commerce in Wuhan. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, sixty percent of Wuhan's factories, large and small, relocated to the southwest and northwest, suffering great losses. Before liberation, they were subjected to the exhaustive plundering of the White bandit Chong Xi. Therefore, the economic situation in Wuhan cannot be compared with other major ports. However, in the year since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the government and the Communist Party, Wuhan's industry and commerce have gradually improved amidst difficulties.
    In terms of public-private relations, the government can provide timely assistance to industries beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood when they encounter real difficulties, helping them overcome these difficulties. For example, the Hankou No. 1 Cotton Mill, due to a lack of funds in September of last year, was lent 10,000 dan of raw cotton by the Central South Trade Department, which was repaid with cotton yarn three months later. In April and May of this year, the Central South Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company twice lent Shenxin and Yuhua a total of 7,000 dan of raw cotton. In general, the public-private relations in Wuhan are relatively good. In terms of taxation, Wuhan's industry and commerce bear a relatively heavy burden. However, due to the diligence of the tax bureau and the careful and energetic efforts of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce in conducting democratic appraisal work, the task was completed one hundred percent. Wuhan's public bond quota was 6.5 million shares, which was difficult considering the actual economic situation. However, thanks to the call of the municipal government and the enthusiastic support of industry and commerce, more than eighty-three percent was completed. Labor-capital relations in Wuhan are generally very stable. This is the result of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the Labor Bureau's ability to correctly grasp policies. Since liberation a year ago, there have been a total of 359 labor-capital dispute cases, 337 of which have been reasonably handled by the Labor Bureau. The workers in Wuhan have a high level of awareness, and they truly demonstrate the demeanor of the leading class. For example, in the cloth industry, wages were originally calculated based on the "leading dragon" fine cloth, which the capitalists could not afford. The workers voluntarily changed to using work-point scores and reduced their wages. Recently, the cloth factory workers of the No. 1 Cotton Mill reduced their wages by nineteen percent. There are many examples of wage reductions in other small and medium-sized factories and shops. The textile industry in Wuhan first signed a collective contract at the end of last year, and although it had many shortcomings due to the lack of experience on both sides, it played a good role in establishing new labor-capital relations based on equality and contract. Since the timely promulgation of the instructions of the Central Ministry of Labor on labor-capital consultation meetings, Wuhan is actively promoting them, and many have been established in various units and industries. Thanks to this correct method, labor-capital relations have basically moved towards normalcy.
    In March and April, Wuhan's industry and commerce encountered great difficulties due to stable prices and the cessation of false purchasing power, resulting in a disconnection between production and sales, and they cried out. Two phrases well express their mood, called "Hanging the red flag, five hearts are unsettled; twisting the Yangko, it's difficult to advance or retreat." In May, after listening to Vice-Chairman Deng Zihui's speech at the Third Wuhan Municipal People's Congress, the reasons for the difficulties at that time were explained, and a bright future was pointed out. At the same time, prices stabilized, and the government made some appropriate adjustments in public-private relations, so the mood of industrialists and businessmen improved, and they also changed the above two phrases. They said: "Hanging the red flag, five hearts are settled; twisting the Yangko, steadily moving forward." This shows that the most difficult stage for industry and commerce has basically passed, and from now on, it will get better day by day.
    Finally, on behalf of the industrial and commercial circles of Wuhan, I express my sincere support for the reports of Vice-Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, Vice-Premier Chen, and other leaders. And to the great leader Chairman Mao, I extend my highest respect!

　　人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言
    一九五○年六月二十二日
    特邀列席工业家
    厉旡咎的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】特邀列席工业家厉旡咎二十二日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席、副主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    中央人民政府成立八个月来，给人民做了不少事情。现在听了人民政府各位首长的报告，我们更多的知道在军事政治外交财经等工作上，都有了不少的伟大成就。在军事上，解放了除台湾西藏外的全部国土，获得了真正统一安定的局面。在外交上，与先进的友邦苏联，订立了中苏友好同盟互助条约，无比的增强了世界和平民主力量，重重的打击了战争贩子们的阴谋。在财经上，完成了全国财政统一，国家收支，接近平衡，稳定了通货与物价。这都是史无前例的伟大成就。而这种成就，是在毛主席和中共中央的正确领导下才能完成的。我们非常兴奋，衷诚的感戴我们的伟大领袖毛主席。
    解放以来，由于环境的激剧改变，工商业者遭遇了或多或少的困难。但是，这些困难，是胜利带来的困难，而且是暂时的困难。应该说：这些困难对于我们工商业者是有好处的，是我们从不正常的经营转向合理的经营必须忍受的一服良药。我们受了这些困难，才知必须改造自己。
    我们听了刘副主席的土地改革报告，知道在三年以内，在基本上可以完成全国的土地改革。土改完成后，农业生产将大量增加，农村购买力将大见提高。我们听了陈副总理的财经报告，知道中央人民政府对于工商业的调整和税收问题等，都有了更明确的指示和合理的照顾。这说明：中央人民政府正在为工商业安排良好的基石，创造发展的条件。
    但是，工商业本身不加改造，专想依靠政府，那是克服不了困难的。我们的组织臃肿，就应该紧缩而健全起来。我们不但要增加生产，还要精打细算，克服浪费现象。我们要信任工人，依靠工人，建立平等的、民主的、契约的、两利的新的劳资关系。我们当遵照共同纲领，在国营经济领导之下，分工合作来完成恢复与发展生产的任务。我们必须先自己努力，才能接受政府的照顾，才能克服困难，才能求得将来的发展。
    我是从武汉来的，仅向各位报告些武汉工商业的概况。在抗日战争时，武汉百分之六十的大小工厂，向西南西北迁移，遭了很大的损失。在解放前，又受了白匪崇禧的尽情搜括。因此，武汉的经济情况，是不能与其他各大埠等量齐观的。但是，解放一年以来，由于政府与共产党的领导正确，武汉的工商业，已在困难中逐渐好转了。
    就公私关系来说，对国计民生有益的工业，到了实在困难时，政府能及时的予以照顾，协助其克服困难。例如汉口第一纱厂，去年九月间，因缺乏资金，中南贸易部借予原棉一万担，三个月后，再以棉纱抵还。今年四五月间，中南花纱布公司两次借给申新、裕华原棉共七千担。大体上说，武汉的公私关系，是比较做得好的。就税收来说，武汉工商业所负的任务是比较重的。但由于税局的尽职，武汉工商联举行民主评议工作的谨慎而努力，百分之百完成了任务。武汉市公债的认额是六百五十万分，就经济实况来说，是有困难的。但由于市政府的号召，工商业的热忱拥护，完成了百分之八十三以上。武汉的劳资关系，一般来说，是很稳定的。这是武汉市委会，总工会，劳动局能正确掌握政策的成果。自解放一年以来，劳资纠纷案件共三五九起，三三七件已由劳动局作了合理的处理。武汉的工人，觉悟是很高的，他们确实表现了领导阶级的风度。例如布匹业，本来以龙头细布折算工资，资方不胜负担，工人自动改用工薪分数，并减低了工资。最近第一纱厂的布厂工人减低工资百分之十九。其他中小型工厂商店，减低工资的例子很多。武汉的纺织业，首先于去年年底订立了集体合同，虽然因双方都没有经验，缺点很多。但于建立平等契约的新的劳资关系，是起了很好的作用的，自从中央劳动部及时的颁布了劳资协商会议的指示，武汉正在积极推行，各单位各行业已成立了很多。由于这个正确办法，劳资关系，基本上已走向正常。
    在三四月间，武汉工商业，由于物价稳定，虚假购买力的停止，因而产销脱节，遇到了很大困难，也发出了叫喊。有两句话很可表现他们的情绪，叫做“挂红旗五心不定，扭秧歌进退两难。”到了五月间，听了邓子恢副主席在武汉市第三次各界代表会上的讲话说明了当时困难的原因，并指出了光明的远景。同时物价稳定了，政府又在公私关系上作了若干适当的调整，于是工商业者的情绪好转了，他们把以上两句话也改了。他们说：“挂红旗五心已定，扭秧歌稳步前进。”这说明，工商业的困难，最严重的阶段，基本上已将过去了，今后，将一天天的好转。
    最后，我代表武汉市工商界，对刘副主席、周总理、陈副总理以及其他各位首长的报告，表示衷诚的拥护。并向伟大领袖毛主席，谨致崇高的敬意！
