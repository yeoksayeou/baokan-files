Two Lessons:
    Health Propaganda Must Be Combined with Production; Rural Doctors Urgently Need to be United and Transformed

    From the Xinxiang Special District's epidemic prevention work in this phase, two important lessons were learned: First, rural epidemic prevention and health work must be closely combined with production and gradually advanced under the existing conditions; dogmatic propaganda and overly high demands are ineffective. When the district began health propaganda, some people reflected: "The problem of production has not been solved, yet you are talking about hygiene!" Later, the district adopted the method of "calculating accounts," using local sick households as examples, investigating the losses in labor and medical expenses due to illness, to educate everyone, explaining the harm of infectious diseases to production, and reminding everyone to pay attention to health and epidemic prevention. Secondly, many farmers in the district have traditionally lived with their livestock; it is currently impossible to fundamentally improve hygiene. The district combined with the manure accumulation campaign, calling on everyone to sweep more, and frequently add bedding to pens, to gradually improve environmental sanitation.

    Second, uniting and transforming local doctors is an important condition for doing a good job in rural health work. In the spring epidemic prevention in the district, many doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine demonstrated the spirit of serving the people, actively participating in the epidemic prevention team to carry out propaganda and prevention work, and some doctors also contributed effective medical prescriptions to assist the government in epidemic prevention. However, many old doctors were profit-oriented, taking advantage of the prevalence of infectious diseases to deceive and extort sick households and obstruct epidemic prevention work. For example, a Western doctor in Ningzhen charged 90,000 yuan for an injection of penicillin; a Western doctor in Xiaogaozhen used distilled water to impersonate penicillin and swindle money. Many traditional Chinese medicine doctors were afraid that the treatment and vaccination by the epidemic prevention team would steal their business, so they deliberately spread rumors to undermine the credibility of the epidemic prevention team, or promoted that "foreign seedlings (referring to cowpox vaccine) are not as good as old seedlings (referring to the vaccine they use for inoculation)," which increased the difficulty of epidemic prevention work.

　　两点经验教训：
    卫生宣传必须结合生产  农村医生亟待团结改造
    从新乡专区此一阶段的防疫工作中，获得了两点重要的经验教训：第一，农村防疫卫生工作必须和生产密切结合，在现有条件下逐步推进；教条式的宣传与过高的要求都是不起作用的。该区在开始进行卫生宣传时，部分群众反映：“生产问题还解决不了，还讲什么卫生！”后来该区采取了“算账”的办法，用当地生病户作实例，调查他家因生病所耽误的工夫和医药花费等损失，以此教育大家，说明传染病对生产的危害，提醒大家注意卫生防疫。其次，该区许多农户历来都是人畜杂居，要根本改进卫生，目前办不到。该区就结合积肥运动，号召大家多扫除、勤垫圈，以逐步改善环境卫生。
    第二，团结改造地方医生，是作好农村卫生工作的重要条件。该区在春季防疫中，有不少中、西医表现了为人民服务的精神，积极参加防疫队进行宣传防治工作，有的医生并献出有效的医方，协助政府防疫。但还有不少旧医生唯利是图，利用传染病流行的机会欺骗敲诈病户并阻碍防疫工作。如宁镇某西医，打一针盘尼西林索价九万元；小高镇某西医，以蒸馏水假充盘尼西林骗钱。还有不少中医怕防疫队的治疗与种痘抢去了他们的生意，竟故意造谣破坏防疫队的威信，或宣传“洋苗（指牛痘苗）不如老苗（指他们所用以接种的痘苗）”等，增加了防疫工作的困难。（根据新乡专署卫生科工作报告中材料）
