　　Save Administrative Costs, Facilitate Large-Scale Use of Machines
    Soviet Union Launches Collective Farm Merger Movement
    Farmers in New Gorky Farm Expected to Double Harvests
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 12th] According to TASS, Moscow, June 9th: In order to more effectively utilize the benefits of large-scale management, Soviet collective farmers are currently launching a collective farm merger movement in most states across the country. Initiated by Ukrainian farmers, the movement has now seen the emergence of hundreds of large farms in Moscow, Leningrad, Lisson, Gorky, and other states, each formed by the merger of six to ten adjacent labor collectives.

    The merged operation of farms can reduce administrative costs, allow agronomists, livestock breeders, and veterinarians to concentrate their work, enable large-scale use of modern machinery, and facilitate the construction of large-scale power stations, processing plants, and childcare facilities, hospitals, theaters, and cinemas.

    Six small collective farms in the Moscow region merged to form the largest collective farm in the state, named after Lenin, possessing over two thousand hectares of land. After merging, three collective farms in the Velikiye Luki region were named the Gorky Farm, covering one thousand seven hundred and sixteen hectares. Due to the large-scale operation, farmers' harvests are expected to increase two to three times. Hundreds of small collective farms in the Leningrad region are also undergoing mergers. The collective farm "Lenin's Road," formed by the merger of eight villages, possesses six thousand eight hundred hectares of land and is embarking on an ambitious construction plan.

　　节省行政费用便利大规模使用机器
    苏展开集体农场合并运动
    新的高尔基农场农民收成可增加二倍
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：苏联集体农民为了更有效地利用大规模经营的便利，现正在全国多数州中展开集体农场的合并运动。运动由乌克兰农民发起，现在莫斯科、列宁格勒、利森、高尔基等州已经出现了数百个由六个到十个由相邻的劳动组合合并组成的大农场。
    农场的合并经营，可以减少行政费用，可以使农学家、牲畜饲养家和兽医集中工作，可以大规模利用现代化机器，并且便利进行大规模的电力站、加工工厂、以及保育机关、医院、剧院和电影院的建设工作。
    莫斯科州六个小集体农场合并组成了一个以列宁为名的、全州最大的集体农场，拥有二千余公顷田地。维利基·卢基州三个集体农场合并后，命名为高尔基农场，占地一千七百十六公顷，由于大规模的经营，农民的收成可望增加到二倍至三倍。列宁格勒州的数百个小集体农场也在进行合并。由八个村庄合并为列宁之路的集体农场，拥有土地六千八百公顷，正在着手进行宏大的建设计划。
