　　Arab People's Anti-Imperialist Sentiment Surges
    Rejection of Joint Declaration by US, Britain, and France
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 20th] According to a United Press report from Cairo: The joint declaration by the US, Britain, and France concerning the supply of military equipment to countries in the Near East and Middle East "has created a very bad impression in the Arab world." The Arabs "are cold toward this declaration because they fear the Western powers will include the Middle East in their cold war." Currently, "Arab anti-British and anti-American sentiment is not only not decreasing but is rising."
    According to a Reuters report from Alexandria: Iraqi Prime Minister Sudiwi declared on the 12th: "The Iraqi government has decided to reject the declaration by the Western powers on the sale of arms to the Middle East."

　　阿拉伯人民反帝情绪高涨
    摈斥美英法联合宣言
    【新华社二十日讯】据合众社开罗讯：美、英、法三国关于以军火供应近东、中东各国的联合宣言，“在阿拉伯世界中产生了非常恶劣的印象”。阿拉伯人“对该宣言表示冷淡，因为他们恐怕西方列强将把中东包括在它们的冷战之内”。目前，“阿拉伯人反英与反美的情绪，不但没有减低而且正在高涨着”。
    又据路透社亚历山大讯：伊拉克总理苏迪威于十二日宣称：“伊拉克政府已决定摈斥西方三强关于售予中东军火的宣言。”
