　　Science Under Capitalism is in Decline
    Li Siguang

    At a welcoming reception held on April 16th by the cultural, educational, and scientific communities of Nanjing, Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered a speech titled "Science Under Capitalism is in Decline." The speech is as follows:

    Before I begin, I must first state that I have been abroad for the past two years and have not had the opportunity to visit Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union, nor have I been to the United States. Therefore, I cannot provide extensive commentary on the scientific situation in those countries. Some friends have hastily asked me to speak on "Trends in Scientific Development Abroad," which is perhaps too broad a topic. I can only provide a rough overview of the state of scientific development in various Western European countries based on what I have seen and heard. From the state of science in Western Europe, we can roughly discern the direction of global scientific development.

    Prior to the war, Western European countries, having developed science earlier than the United States, generally felt—from scientists to the general public—that Europe was advanced and the United States was a latecomer. Particularly in the realm of "pure science," Western European countries generally conducted more in-depth and extensive research. However, after this World War, the center of scientific activity shifted significantly, seemingly moving from Western Europe to the other side of the Atlantic—the United States. Why did this phenomenon occur? What implications does it hold? I will address this later.

    I recall that after the end of World War I, Western scientists immediately abandoned weapons and weapons research. However, despite the long end of the recent war, scientists in most capitalist countries in Western Europe are still largely engaged in war preparation research and weapons manufacturing. This is not necessarily their own desire, but rather a result of the political and economic systems forcing them to do so. According to a reliable report published by the British Science Association's magazine in 1948, 60 percent of all expenditures on science and scientific research in Britain that year (including both government and private sectors) were used for research related to war preparation or weapons manufacturing. If we consider only the British government's expenditure, the figure rises to 80 percent. The same report indicated that 2,836 scientists in Britain were engaged in war research and weapons research, accounting for approximately 20 percent of all those engaged in applied science in Britain. France spends only eight million pounds annually on scientific endeavors, excluding war research, of which only one million pounds is allocated to so-called basic scientific research. The situation is similar in other capitalist countries in Western Europe. Due to the shortage of funds for genuine scientific research, lack of resources, and the continuation of conditions caused by the war, and also because the main camp of capitalism shifted from Western Europe to the United States, many scientific researchers in Western Europe, enticed by the better treatment offered by American imperialism, have unwittingly and continuously migrated across the Atlantic. According to rough estimates, approximately 50 percent of Western Europe's more established scientists have gone to the United States. What does American imperialism want these people for? Primarily, of course, it is still to engage in war preparation and research and manufacture new weapons. Therefore, since the last war, science in the capitalist countries of Western Europe has shown a declining trend in terms of both personnel and financial resources. This is not to say that Western Europe has no outstanding scientists now, but rather that those talented scientists are absolutely powerless to reverse this trend.

    As for the scientists who remain in Western Europe, they can be broadly divided into three categories: (1) those rejected by American imperialism; (2) those who are reluctant to leave their homeland and their existing positions; these individuals either value their self-respect and dignity and are unwilling to be manipulated by foreigners, or they vaguely harbor a sense of patriotism and follow the orders of their own government; (3) those who have clearly seen the current serious situation in the world and the great conspiracy of the reactionaries in their own countries and American imperialism, firmly stand at their own posts, diligently engage in their respective fields of work, and severely refute the absurd behaviors of American imperialism and the reactionaries in their own countries. Although these individuals are not numerous, they are mostly outstanding scientists. Despite enduring various attacks and unbearable oppression, they are fearless. The future non-decline of science in Western Europe depends entirely on the efforts of these people, but in the current unfortunate situation, their circumstances and emotions are not much different from our circumstances before liberation; they are suffering greatly.

    So, does the decline of science in Western European capitalist countries and the mass exodus of scientists to the United States mean that the future of scientific development in American imperialism holds increased promise? No, quite the contrary. Because American imperialism's recruitment of this group of talent is accommodated under the conditions of the capitalist system, regardless of the ability or inclinations of this group of people, their greatest effect can only be to promote the development of capitalism, but the entire capitalist system is already beyond redemption, and no scientific talent can change this fate.

    In this way, it is not difficult to see that the decline of science in Western Europe, as I mentioned earlier, seems on the surface to be caused by war damage and the failure of society to fully recover to its old scale. In reality, war is not the fundamental cause of this decline. This decline is a decline within the overall decline of the global capitalist system; it is also a phenomenon that occurs simultaneously with the decline of other parts of capitalist society. In Western Europe, it is only a part of it. In other words, the repeated mistakes of Western European capitalism have already determined the fate of American imperialism. The faster it annexes Western Europe, the greater and deeper the contradictions it encounters, and the faster its collapse. This major trend can never be saved by utilizing a few scientific talents. The path indicated by Keynes cannot in the slightest remedy the inherent contradictions of capitalism and its ultimate inevitable collapse, as publicly pointed out by Marx and Engels in November 1847. From the more than 100 years of history, especially since the success of the Soviet revolution, various factual manifestations have shown that the so-called change in "quantity" is about to evolve into a change in the entire "quality."

    American imperialism, relying on its geographical convenience, made huge war profits during both World Wars with minimal sacrifices (for example, during World War II, the number of American deaths and injuries was only three times the number of deaths and injuries caused by car accidents in the United States during the same period, while the total number of Soviet deaths and injuries exceeded seven million). As a result, its production volume greatly increased. For example, in terms of steel production, its output was less than 30 million tons in 1914, comparable to Europe, but by 1917, it had increased to about 50 million tons. Later, due to the inevitable economic decline in the capitalist system, steel production declined twice. By 1944, its output had almost reached 110 million tons, while Europe's output in the same year was only over 20 million tons. The United States, with a population of over 140 million, accounting for only 7 percent of the world's population, possessed 60 percent of the total production volume of the capitalist world in 1948. What is particularly unreasonable is that one-third of the two million US dollars in profits in the same year fell into the hands of one-tenth of the Americans, while one-quarter of the Americans did not receive even half of the average profit, and almost all production agencies were controlled by eight monopoly capital groups. 1948 was the peak of the development of American imperialism and also the year when world peace faced the greatest crisis. At that time, it thought that by holding so many US dollars, it could economically control everything in the world; and by holding atomic bombs, radars, and super fortresses, it would be enough to threaten the whole world, subdue the Soviet Union, and even destroy the Soviet Union, wishing it could make something that, with a flick of a switch while sitting in a lounge chair, would immediately destroy everything in any place in the world. But the reality is not that simple.

    After 1948, American imperialism's production decreased, and the number of unemployed people in the country increased. A group of capitalist countries in Western Europe, dragging their broken empires, were walking towards their end. In the eyes of American imperialism, they "can neither command nor obey." The Soviet Union repeatedly expressed its full commitment to maintaining world peace, and American imperialism could not find an excuse to launch a "third world war." The people of Eastern Europe and China have all stood up, and domestic democrats and promising scientists cannot bear the oppression and sometimes cannot help but express their disgust towards those warlords and plutocrats. Under these circumstances, capitalists feel the same pain in their struggles at home and abroad. They have already climbed the highest peak and are on the path to decline, which has become a definite fact. To prolong their existence, they still need the help of scientists in Western Europe and at home. Therefore, what scientists under the capitalist system feel at the present stage is an extremely important issue.

    Human knowledge is social. Scientists nurtured in a capitalist society based on the principle of free enterprise, free competition in a free market, naturally advocate "academic freedom" and "freedom of thought." At the same time, their minds must also reflect many basic categories of philosophy and science—such as space, time, species, hierarchy, causality, etc.—in the context of capitalist society. In short, the foundation of science under the capitalist system inevitably reflects the model of capitalist society. For example, in the field of physical science, the rigid geometric universe, and even the decay of the universe deduced from thermodynamics, perfectly suit the taste of capitalist society. Another example is the Bessman-Morgan theory of heredity, which perfectly meets the needs of imperialists. This kind of temporarily popular theory, or view, is now shaking and declining along with the shaking and declining of the capitalist system. Changes in basic viewpoints may not be noticed by the general public, but in the minds of scientists, it is a kind of panic or a revolution. Scientists feel that they have now reached a crossroads, and some people have seen through the invisible ideological constraints they have suffered in the past. The so-called ideals of "academic freedom," etc., are just deformations of the spells and other categories used in the early development of science and technology.

    In addition, with the degeneration of the capitalist system to this day, most scientists have to engage in research on deadly weapons and keep secrets. Because of keeping secrets, not only do scientists lose contact with each other's work and lose interest, but also individuals lose their freedom and are like prisoners. For this reason, scientists can no longer comfort themselves with the phrase "doing science for the sake of truth," because of these many unavoidable contradictions, apart from those who are muddleheaded and unpromising, other scientists with slightly progressive ideas either abandon their work decisively due to the reproaches of their conscience, or hold pessimism and wander in different paths. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for us to believe that remarkable contributions will be made. For example, the manufacture of atomic bombs or hydrogen bombs, supersonic aircraft, radar, radioactive poisons, parrot microorganisms, etc., are only some developments in technology, not new inventions in science. The above is a general overview of the situation in the West, as far as I can see.

    Although China's society is not entirely the same as that of Western Europe, today, to lay a new foundation in science, we should not only pay attention to the problems that have already occurred in Western Europe, but also overcome the bad habits brought about by the feudal system and the comprador system. For example, unfortunate signs such as monopolizing academic groups and relying on foreign guarantees have existed in the past. Under the former trend, if one person presides over a scientific institution, this institution seems to belong to them privately. Therefore, what follows is everyone vying to occupy it, which is equivalent to capitalists wanting to create a monopoly. Due to their respective private concepts, gaps inevitably arise between them. Even for the sake of personal interests, they inevitably become jealous and bully each other. Under the latter trend, if a person achieves something abroad, unless they understand it themselves, it is easy to become arrogant and boastful. This is an inevitable phenomenon under the old system. But in today's new society, we should thoroughly eliminate these problems.

    Everything I have encountered since returning to the motherland this time has been significantly different, which is something that makes all of us feel very happy and excited. [Xinhua News Agency]

　　资本主义制度下的科学在衰落
    李四光
    中国科学院副院长李四光于四月十六日在南京市文教、科学界欢迎会上以《资本主义制度下的科学在衰落》为题，发表演说。讲词如下：
    在讲话之前，首先要说明的是：我这两年在国外，没有能够到东欧、苏联，也没有去过美国，所以对上述国家的科学情形我不能做多的说明。有几个朋友仓促要我讲“国外科学发展的趋势”，范围也许太大。现在我只能就所见到或听到的西欧各国科学发展的情形约略的谈一谈。从西欧科学发展的情形也可以大致看出世界科学发展的方向。
    大战以前，西欧各国的科学因为比美国发展得早，他们一般科学家乃至一般社会总觉得欧洲是先进，美国是后起。尤是在“纯粹科学”方面，就一般而言，西欧各国的确研究得比较深入而广泛。但经过这次世界大战，西方科学活动的中心，引起了很大的变动；过去西欧的地位似乎已经转移到大西洋的彼岸——美国去了。为什么发生这种现象？这种现象包含着什么意义？待一会儿再来说明。
    记得第一次世界大战完结以后，西方的科学家，立刻抛弃了武器以及武器的研究。而这一次大战虽然早已结束，但是在西欧一般资本主义国家内的科学工作者，仍然多半从事准备战争的研究工作以及武器的制造。这并不是他们本身都愿意这样作，而是由于政治和经济制度逼迫他们非要这样作不可。根据英国科协杂志在一九四八年发表一篇很可靠的报告，我们知道在同年度英国全部发展科学和科学研究的费用中（包括政府与民间两部分），有百分之六十是用在研究准备战争或制造武器方面。如仅从英国政府方面来说，则有百分之八十是用在研究准备战争或制造武器方面。在同一篇报告中指出英国有二八三六个科学家从事战争的研究和武器的研究。这个数目，要占英国全部从事应用科学人数的百分之二十左右。法国总共用在科学事业上的费用，除了作战争研究以外，不过一年八百万镑，其中只有一百万镑用在所谓基本科学研究上。这种情形在西欧其他资本主义国家也是差不多的。由于研究真正科学的经费短少，物质缺乏，以及其他战时引起的情况延续下去，又由于资本主义的大本营，由西欧迁移到美国，在西欧方面有很多从事科学研究的人们，受到美帝较好待遇的引诱，也不知不觉，随着这种趋势不断的渡到大西洋的彼岸去了！据约略的估计：西欧差不多有百分之五十较有地位的科学家到了美国。美帝要这些人干什么呢？主要的当然依旧是搞战争准备和研究制造新武器。所以这次大战后，在西欧各资本主义国家内，科学方面已呈现着人财两空的衰落现象。这并不是说：西欧现在没有杰出的科学家，而是说那些有才能的科学家，绝对无法挽回这样的风气。
    至于留在西欧的科学家，概括的可以分为三类：（一）是美帝不要的人；（二）是舍不得离开祖国，离开原有的地位的人；这些人或者出于自尊自重，不愿受外国人的摆布；或者是含含糊糊，秉着一种爱国心，听本国政府的驱使；（三）是看清了当前世界严重的局面，以及本国的反动者和美帝联合的大阴谋，坚决站在他们自己的岗位上，一方面苦心从事本行的工作，一方面严厉的驳斥美帝和他们本国反动者荒谬的行为。这些人虽然为数不太多，然而大都是杰出的科学家，虽然忍受着种种的攻击和不堪的压迫，他们是毫不顾惜的。将来西欧科学的发展不坠，全靠这一些人的努力，但在现时的倒楣局势之下，他们的处境和我们解放以前的处境，情绪上相差不远，他们也够苦了。
    那么，是不是说西欧资本主义各国科学呈现着衰落，科学工作者纷纷逃往美国去，美帝科学的发展前途增加希望呢？不是的，恰恰相反。因为美帝收罗这一批人才，是在资本制度条件之下容纳的，不管这一批人的能力如何，倾向如何，他们最大的效用，只能起促进资本主义发展的作用，但是整个资本主义制度已经无可救药，任何科学人才也不能改变这一命运。
    这样，我们不难看出：方才所说到的西欧科学衰落情况，在表面上似乎因为战争破坏，社会一般的旧规模还没有恢复所致。实际上战争还不是这种衰落的基本原因。这种衰落是整个世界资本主义制度衰落中的一种衰落；也是与资本主义社会中其他部分衰落同时发生的一种现象。在西欧还不过是其中的一部分而已。换句话说：西欧资本主义的复辙，已经注定美帝的命运，他吞并西欧愈快，他所遭遇的矛盾愈大而且愈深，他的崩溃愈速。这种大的趋势，决不是利用若干科学人才所能挽救的。凯恩斯所指的路线，不能丝毫补救马克思和恩格斯在一八四七年十一月所公开指出资本主义本身的矛盾和最后必然的崩溃。从这一百多年的历史，尤其自苏联革命成功以后，种种事实上的表现看起来，所谓“量”的变化，就快要演成整个“质”的变化了。
    美帝靠着他地理上的便利，当两次世界大战的时候，以极少的牺牲（例如在第二次大战的时候，美国的死伤，不过同时期在美国国内因汽车出事死伤的三倍，而苏联的死伤总数超过七百万），每次都发了大批的世难财，因此他的生产量大增。比如就钢铁的产量说：在一九一四年他的产量不到三千万吨，和欧洲相等，到一九一七年他增加到五千万吨左右，以后因为在资本制度中无可避免的经济衰落的关系，钢铁产量两次降落，到一九四四年，他的产量差不多达到一万一千万吨，而同年度欧洲的产量不过两千多万吨。美国的人口，有一万四千多万，仅仅占世界人口百分之七，在一九四八年，这百分之七的人口，竟拥有资本主义世界总生产量的百分之六十，尤其不合理的是：同年度两百万万美元的利润的三分之一，落在十分之一的美国人手里，四分之一的美国人，得不着平均利润的半数，而一切的生产机关，差不多都受八个垄断资本集团的控制。一九四八年是美帝资本主义发展的最高峰，也就是世界和平遭遇着最大危机的一年。当时他以为一面拿着这样多的美元，可以在经济上控制世界的一切；一面拿着原子弹、雷达、超级空中堡垒，已经足够威胁全世界，压服苏联，甚至破坏苏联，恨不得作出一种东西，他坐在躺椅里把开关一开，世界上任何地方，立刻全体毁灭。但是事实不是那样简单。
    一九四八年以后，美帝的生产减少，国内失业人数增加。西欧一群资本主义国家拖着他们那残破的帝国，本身走到末路。在美帝看起来，“既不能令，又不受命”。苏联一再表示用全力维护世界和平，美帝无法借口发动“三次大战”。东欧以及中国人民都翻身起来了，国内的民主人士，以及有为的科学家，受不了压迫，有时不免对那些武人财阀表示厌恶。在这种情况之下，资本家们对国内和对国外的挣扎，都感觉到同样的苦恼。他们已经爬过最高峰，走上衰落的途上，成了确实的事实，他们要苟延残喘，仍然少不了要西欧以及国内的科学家替他们帮忙。所以在现阶段资本制度下的科学家感想何如，是一个极重要的问题。
    人的知识是社会的，在一个以自由企业在自由市场中作自由竞争为原则的资本主义社会中陶养出来的科学家，自然以“学术自由”、“思想自由”，彼此互相号召。同时他们心目中，也一定反映着许多哲学、科学上的基本门类——例如空间、时间、种类、等级、因果等——在资本制度社会中关联的情况。简单的说：在资本制度下科学的基础，免不掉反映着资本社会的模型。比如在物理科学方面死板板的几何型的宇宙乃至于从热力学而推到宇宙的衰老，恰好适合资本主义社会的口味。又比如贝斯曼——莫根遗传的学说，恰好切合帝国主义者的需要。这一类一时风行的学说，或者看法，今天也随着资本制度的动摇、衰落而同时动摇、衰落了。基本观点的变更，在普通社会，也许不大注意，但是在科学家的心目，确是一种恐慌，或者一种革命。科学家都感觉到现在已经走到十字路上，同时有若干人识破了过去所受到的无影无形思想上的束缚。而所谓“学术自由”等项理想者，只是在科学和技术初期发展时，所用到的符咒等类的变形而已。
    另外，在资本制度堕落到了今天，要多数的科学家从事研究杀人的利器，不能不保守秘密，就因为保守秘密的关系，不独科学家彼此的工作，失掉联系，了无兴趣，而且个人失掉了自由，和囚犯一样，因为这种原因，科学家再也不能用“为真理而搞科学”这句话自己安慰自己，因为这许多不可避免的矛盾，除了糊里糊涂，没出息的人们以外，其他思想稍稍进步的科学家，不是受良心的苛责，断然抛弃他的工作，就是抱着悲观，彷徨歧路罢了。在这种情况之下，我们很难相信，有了不得的贡献出来。譬如原子弹或者氢气弹，超音速率飞机，雷达，放射毒，鹦鹉微生物等类的制造，都不过是在技术上的一些发展，并不是科学上的新发明。以上西方的情形，就个人能见到的是大致如此。
    中国的社会固然不与西欧尽同，但是今天要在科学上打下一个新的基础，不独应该留心西欧已经发生了的毛病，而且还要克服在封建制度和买办制度下带来的坏习惯。例如把持学术团体，靠外国的保障等类不幸的迹象，过去不是没有的。在前一风气之下，一个人主持某一个科学机构，这机构好像属于他私有的了。因此伴着而来的就是大家争相霸占，等于资本家要造成垄断的现象。由于各自的私有观念，彼此间就不免发生隔阂。甚至于为了个人利害，彼此互相忌妒、欺凌。在后一风气之下，一个人在国外得到一点成就，除非他自己明白，否则就很容易自大自夸起来了。这是旧的制度下必然发生的现象。但是在今天新的社会里，我们应该彻底清除这些毛病。
    我这次回到祖国来，所遇到一切现象，已经有了显著的不同，这是使我们大家感觉得很愉快和兴奋的。【新华社】
