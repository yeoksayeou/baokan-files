Focus on Developing Water Conservancy and Irrigation
    Lutai Electrified Water Conservancy Station Completed
    Seven Water Conservancy Districts Divided, Capable of Irrigating 30,000 Mu of Land
    [Our Tangshan Dispatch] In order to focus on developing water conservancy and irrigation, the Bohai District Agricultural Reclamation Bureau has established the largest electrified water conservancy station in North China in Lutai, using the water of the Ji Canal for water conservancy irrigation. Since its establishment, the station has begun to establish electrified water conservancy districts and, together with the farmers, form joint management organizations. As of now, the station has established seven electrified water conservancy districts, including Dating, Beijian, Nanjian, Dabozhuang, Dayinzhuang, Dongzhuangzi, and Huangguazhuang. Each district has a pumping station, totaling 21 pumps in the seven districts, with a total of 1456 horsepower and 23 transformers, irrigating an area of 32,215 mu of land. With the assistance of the local government, four-level organizations for managing electrified water conservancy production have been established in each district: namely, the Station Affairs Committee (composed of the station director, district chiefs, district committee members, etc.), the Electrified Water Conservancy District Management Committee (composed of responsible cadres of the water conservancy district, leaders of the electrical technician team, district cadres, and village cadres), the Village Water Conservancy Production Committee (composed of the directors of the village farmers' associations and village cadres), and the Water Conservancy Production Team (composed of farmers along each intake ditch). The knowledge of electrified water conservancy has been widely disseminated to the farmers.

　　重点开办水利灌溉事业
    芦台电化水利站告成       
    划分七个水利区可灌溉土地三万亩
    【本报唐山讯】为重点开办水利灌溉事业，渤海区农垦局已在芦台建立了华北最大的电化水利站，利用蓟运河的水施行水利灌溉。该站自建立之日起，即着手建立电化水利区，电化水利站，与农民建立共同管理的组织。至现在为止，该站已建立了大艇、北涧、南涧、大薄庄、大尹庄、董庄子、皇姑庄等七个电化水利区，每区有一个扬水场设备，计七区共有二十一台水泵，共有一四五六马力，变压器二十三台，灌溉土地面积有三二二一五亩。并在当地政府协助下，在各区组织了管理电化水利生产的四级组织：即站务委员会（由站主任及区长、区委等组成）、电化水利区管理委员会（由水利区负责干部、电技工小组长、区干部及各村干部组成）、村水利生产委员会（由各村农会主任及村干部组成）、水利生产小组（由每一进水沟各农户组成）。并普遍对农民灌输了电化水利的常识。
