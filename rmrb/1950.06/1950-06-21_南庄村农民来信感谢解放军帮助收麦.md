To the Editor:

It is now the time for the wheat harvest. The People's Liberation Army stationed in our village (Nanzhuang Village, Fifteenth District, Beijing Suburbs), in order to help farmers and military families solve the problem of labor shortages, are helping us pull wheat and hoe the fields. They work quickly and well. We are extremely grateful and boiled water for the comrades to drink. They refused to drink it, saying, "If we want to drink water, the kitchen will prepare it for us, don't bother the villagers. Everything we eat and wear comes from the people, what does helping you with this little bit of work count for?" This made us even more grateful beyond words. We really don't know how to thank the PLA enough. Please, Editor, publish these words from the bottom of our hearts in the newspaper!

The entire peasantry of Nanzhuang Village, Fifteenth District, Beijing

　　南庄村农民来信感谢解放军帮助收麦编辑同志：
    现在正是麦收的时候。驻在我们村（京郊十五区南庄村）的人民解放军，为了帮助农民及军人家属解决劳力困难，帮助我们拔麦子、锄地。他们干得又快又好。我们感到万分感激，烧了开水给同志们喝。他们不喝，并说：“我们要喝水，有伙房给我们准备，不要老乡们费心了。我们吃的、穿的都是老百姓的，帮助你们干这一点活儿算什么？”这样更使我们感激得无话可说了。我们真不知道怎样感谢解放军才好。请编辑同志把我们这心底的话给登在报上吧！
              北京十五区南庄村全体农民
