Hebei Holds Economic Security Conference
    Determines Security Work Guidelines for the Second Half of the Year
    [Baoding News] Correspondent Zhang Junfeng reports: The Industry Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government convened its first Economic Security Conference on the 16th of this month. The main purpose of the meeting was to implement the spirit of "safe production and eliminating accidents," emphasizing safety first for both public and private mines, and striving to eliminate or reduce avoidable work-related injuries, illnesses, and disasters.
    Over the past year, public and private factories and mines in Hebei Province have undergone three major inspections, and some improvements have been made in security work, leading to a significant reduction in major accidents. For example, from January to May of this year, except for one fatality each at the Huyugou and Shaoming mines, no fatal accidents occurred at other mines. However, disasters and accidents still occur frequently in various factories and mines. According to statistics from the state-owned Zhangcun and Shaoming mines, there are fifty injuries per 10,000 tons of coal, while the Guoerzhuang mine has as many as ninety-five injuries per 10,000 tons of coal, accounting for over 19% of all employees. The main reasons for these problems in the past were that leading cadres did not have a clear understanding of the idea of safety first and treated safety as being in opposition to production tasks; some mine leaders even believed that the occurrence of accidents was a natural force that could not be resisted by human power, and therefore abandoned actively trying to improve the situation. After careful examination at the meeting, everyone agreed that over 70% of disasters, illnesses, and injuries could be avoided, as long as the leadership paid attention and regularly educated workers to overcome superstitious and adventurous thinking, disasters and accidents could definitely be reduced.
    The meeting lasted seven days and determined the guidelines for security work in the second half of 1950: (1) Implement a security responsibility system to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible. In the future, every machine, every tool, and every roadway must not only have someone operating it but also someone inspecting it. Responsibilities for major and minor accidents must be clarified, and rewards and punishments must be clearly distinguished. (2) Improve engineering, adjust power machinery, and study ways to overcome unfavorable conditions in security work. All projects that do not meet specifications and technical regulations must be corrected; and existing machinery and engineering equipment must be improved. (3) Establish a maintenance system for power machinery. All power machinery should be regularly inspected according to the system. The inspection methods may include disassembly inspection, key inspection, normal inspection, special inspection, etc. (4) Strengthen inspection and leadership of small private mines. Private small mines that do not hinder the overall plans of state-owned and collectively-owned enterprises but are needed by the masses should be allowed to operate. In areas with a large number of small kilns, such as Fangshan, Wanping, Wu'an, Cixian, and Quyang counties, security meetings of private small mines should be convened at the county level, in conjunction with local trade unions, in accordance with the spirit of this security conference, to study and improve the safety equipment of each small mine, establish a security system, and establish a joint organization in the nature of a trade association to lead each small kiln to systematically ban illegal exploitation and help achieve worker unity.
    Regarding the health and welfare undertakings of employees, the meeting also made a determination, emphasizing that importance should be attached to the health work of factories and mines in the future, and that the spirit of prioritizing prevention over treatment should be implemented.
    The meeting decided that all factories and mines should launch a safe production campaign in the second half of this year, unite all workers, and fight to eliminate accidents.

### 河北召开经济保安会议  确定下半年保安工作方针

　　河北召开经济保安会议
    确定下半年保安工作方针
    【本报保定讯】通讯员张俊峰报道：河北省人民政府工业厅于本月十六日召开了首次经济保安会议。会议主要是贯彻“安全生产消灭事故”的精神，强调公私矿窑安全第一，争取做到消灭或减少可能避免的公伤疾病与灾害。
    过去一年来，河北省公私营厂矿经过三次大的检查，保安工作已有若干改进，重大事故因之显著减少。如今年一至五月份除胡峪、邵明两矿各牺牲一人外，其他各矿均未发生死亡事故。但各厂矿的灾害和事故仍不断发生，据省营章村、邵明两矿统计，每万吨煤伤五十人，郭尔庄矿每万吨煤竟伤九十五人之多，占全体职工百分之十九强。过去发生这些问题的主要原因是领导干部对安全第一的思想不明确，把安全与生产任务对立起来；有的矿上领导干部竟认为事故的发生，是天然的力量，人力不可抗拒的，因之也就放弃了去积极改进。经过会议认真检查，大家一致认为百分之七十以上的灾害病伤是可以避免的，只要领导上注意并经常教育工人克服迷信冒险思想，灾害及事故一定可以减少。
    会议历经七天，确定了一九五○年下半年保安工作的方针：（一）推行保安专责制，消灭无人负责的现象。今后每架机器，每件工具，每一巷道不但要有人操作，并要有人检查，大小事故要弄清责任，赏罚分明。（二）改进工程，调整动力机械，研究克服保安工作中的不利条件。凡工程按装，不合规格与技术规程的，一律纠正；并根据现有机械设备和工程设备，加以改进。（三）建立动力机械的检修制度。对所有动力机械应按制度经常检查，检查的方法，可采取解体检查，重点检查，正常检查，特种检查等。（四）加强对私营小矿的检查与领导。私人小矿在不妨碍国、公营整个计划，而为群众需要者应准其开采，并在小窑较多的地区，如房山、宛平、武安、磁县、曲阳等县，根据此次保安会议精神，以县为单位结合当地工会召集私营小矿的保安会议，研究改进各小矿安全设备，建立保安制度，并成立同业公会性质的联合组织，领导各小窑有步骤的取缔非法剥削，帮助做到职工团结。
    关于职工卫生福利事业，会议也作了确定，强调提出今后重视厂矿的卫生工作，要将预防重于治疗的精神贯彻下去。
    会议决定各厂矿在今年下半年要展开一次安全生产运动，团结全体工人，为消灭事故而斗争。
