　　China People's Relief Association Issues Statement
    Supporting the Japanese People's Struggle
    Opposing U.S. Imperialist Persecution of Japanese Communist Party Leaders
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] The China People's Relief Association issued a statement on the 16th, supporting the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people. The statement said: The U.S. imperialists, in violation of the Potsdam Declaration, are supporting Japanese fascist forces, delaying the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, releasing Japanese war criminals, restoring Japanese military industry, establishing military bases in Japan, and recently, have intensified their persecution of Japanese Communist Party leaders and all progressive elements in Japan. These illegal and violent acts indicate that U.S. imperialists are trying to turn Japan into a colony and military base, preparing to launch a new war of aggression against peaceful people. For the common interests of the Chinese, Japanese, and all peace-loving people of the world, we support the Japanese people's struggle for democratic freedom and national independence, resolutely oppose the persecution of Japanese Communist Party leaders and other patriotic elements, and call on all peace-loving people around the world to strengthen unity and jointly stop the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to launch a new war of aggression. We firmly believe that the U.S. imperialists' intensification of the enslavement of the Japanese people will promote the further unity and development of the world's anti-U.S. imperialist peace forces, thereby more quickly and thoroughly crushing the culprit and war criminal who harms all mankind – U.S. imperialism.

　　中国人民救济总会发表声明
    声援日本人民斗争     
    反对美帝迫害日共领袖
    【新华社十六日讯】中国人民救济总会于十六日发表声明，声援日本共产党和日本人民。声明称：美帝国主义者违反波茨坦宣言，扶持日本法西斯势力，拖延缔结对日和约，释放日战犯，恢复日军火工业，在日建立军事基地，最近更变本加厉地迫害日共领袖和日本一切进步分子。这种种非法的狂暴行为，表示美帝国主义者正力图变日本为殖民地和军事基地，准备发动反和平人民的新侵略战争。为了中、日和全世界爱好和平人民的共同利益，我们支援日本人民争取民主自由、民族独立的斗争，坚决反对对日共领袖和其他爱国分子的迫害，更呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民加紧团结，共同制止美帝国主义者发动新侵略战争的阴谋。我们深信：美帝国主义者加紧对日本人民的奴役，必将促进全世界反美帝的和平力量更进一步的团结与发展，从而更迅速地彻底粉碎损害全人类的祸首和战争罪犯——美帝国主义者。
