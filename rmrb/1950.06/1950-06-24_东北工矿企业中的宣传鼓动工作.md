　　Propaganda and Mobilization Work in Northeast China's Industrial and Mining Enterprises
    Li Zhuoran, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a conference on propaganda and mobilization work in Northeast China's industrial and mining enterprises in Shenyang on May 20th. Attendees included responsible comrades from the propaganda departments of party committees in cities and industrial and mining enterprises such as Anshan, Fushun, Shenyang, Benxi, Harbin, Dalian, Hegang, Fuxin, as well as cadres from the Cultural and Educational Department of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and various literary and artistic departments directly under the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau. The conference unanimously agreed that with the development of the new record movement in production, the Party's propaganda and mobilization work in enterprises has become particularly important. In some enterprises, remarkable achievements have already been made, and these should be systematically examined and summarized. The conference also put forward the following suggestions: 1. Absorb outstanding elements from the workers to strengthen the propaganda organizations in enterprises; 2. Party organizations in each enterprise should uniformly formulate plans for propaganda and mobilization work for a certain period; 3. Strengthen the inspection and guidance of urban party committees on the propaganda and mobilization work in enterprises, and the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau should convene such meetings regularly to summarize experiences.
    This article is the speech given by Comrade Li Zhuoran, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau, at the conference on May 26th.
          ——Editor
                Comrades:
    Our conference has been very successful. The discussions in groups and at the plenary session have reflected the actual situation of the current work, raised some new issues, exchanged many valuable experiences worth promoting, and criticized certain formalistic styles of work that are divorced from the masses. These are all beneficial to the improvement of our future work. Of course, the systematic establishment of the Party's propaganda and mobilization work in enterprises is only just beginning, and the achievements are still preliminary. The research and summary of the actual situation and work experience in industrial and mining enterprises are still far from sufficient.
    Yesterday, the Northeast Bureau conference, Comrade Gao Gang, specially instructed us not to be satisfied with the existing achievements, but to carry out work more deeply and organize everyone to study better. We should resolutely implement this instruction. Now that the conference is about to end, I would like to express some opinions on the issues raised by the comrades for your consideration:

  I. The Tasks and Role of Propaganda and Mobilization Work in Enterprises

    The task of the Party's propaganda and mobilization work in industrial and mining enterprises is to enlighten and raise the political consciousness of the working class in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to promote the production enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses under the goal of the interests of all the people of our great motherland, to consolidate labor discipline and production order in factories, to fight against all phenomena of extravagance and waste and damage to state property, to encourage engineers, technicians, and staff members to serve enthusiastically and be proficient in their work, to combine labor with science and technology, and to strive to complete and exceed the state production plan in the best possible way.
    Therefore, the propaganda and mobilization work led by the Party is very important in all enterprises. It is a weapon to promote production. Whoever relaxes this work will directly weaken the production initiative in enterprises and hinder the completion of the state production plan. The summary of propaganda and mobilization work in the Shenyang Smelting Plant pointed out: "The propaganda and mobilization work of the smelting plant has become a powerful weapon to promote production. It has been gradually strengthened with the development of the new record movement. It used to be scattered and spontaneous, without attention and organization. Because propaganda and mobilization work played a significant role in promoting the new record movement, the leadership realized that this is a force that cannot be ignored in promoting production." I think this assessment is in line with the actual situation.

  II. Propaganda and Mobilization Work Must Be Closely Combined with Production

    Several comrades pointed out in the discussion that propaganda and mobilization work in enterprises must be combined with production. Without understanding the production technical process, without listening to the opinions of workers, and without understanding the problems in their minds, it is impossible to put forward practical propaganda and mobilization slogans. This is very correct. The experiences of Dalian Glass Factory, Shenyang Smelting Plant, HuangguTun Railway Factory, and other industrial and mining enterprises mentioned in the materials and comrades' speeches all prove the correctness of this view. For example, in order to overfulfill the production task in 1950, the Dalian Glass Factory, after joint research by the Party, the Youth League, and the trade union, put forward four mobilization slogans closely related to production technology: (1) Protect the large kiln (that is, ensure that the large kiln is not repaired for one year); (2) Seventy-one seconds (that is, reduce the time to draw a 1.72-meter wide and 1.240-meter long glass sheet from the original planned 85 seconds to 71 seconds); (3) Ninety percent yield (that is, a glass sheet must maintain 90% of the finished product, only cutting off 10% of the waste edge); (4) Learn new Soviet technology and methods. Under these slogans, a production competition was launched, which promoted the completion and even exceeding of the factory's production tasks. In order to overcome the difficulty of "frozen ore being difficult to load" during the severe cold period, the branch secretary of the Shenyang Smelting Plant proposed at the branch general meeting: "Party members take the lead in breaking through the difficulty of frozen ore being difficult to load." As a result, a competition movement to overcome difficulties emerged, and the difficulty of frozen ore being difficult to dig and load was indeed overcome. The supply of raw materials was guaranteed, and the descent rate increased by 30%. Also, a workshop in the factory put forward the slogan "The site is the classroom, and accidents are the teaching material." As a result, some technicians were mobilized to go deep into the site to seek solutions to technical difficulties. On the March car repair task list of the HuangguTun Railway Machinery Factory, white flags were hung on 14 locomotives. The model number of each locomotive was written on each flag. After each locomotive was repaired, the white flag was dyed red. Each time a part was repaired, it would be dyed red. In this way, all the workers in the factory could clearly know how much of the task had been completed and how much was still unfulfilled. Those who were slow in progress had to intensify their work, which actually played a role in supervising production. Because of sand holes in the cylinder liner, the workers of Chen Zhanpu's group in the foundry department of the factory were drawn on propaganda posters. Everyone felt ashamed. Chen Zhanpu said: "I really feel a little embarrassed. I must find a way to overcome the sand holes in the future." In addition, propaganda and mobilization forms such as waste product exhibitions, workshop production meetings, vivid and eye-catching blackboards, picture newspapers, production charts, and "Glory Stages" and "Accident Product Exhibition Stages" on railways have all proved to be very popular with the masses and have played a timely role in promoting production in enterprises. These good slogans and forms have emerged because the leadership goes deep into reality and is good at understanding the creativity of the masses. By carefully studying their experience, we will know how we should work in the future.

  III. Strengthen Propaganda Organizations and Achieve Unified Leadership

    At present, the propaganda organizations in industrial and mining enterprises are not robust. Comrades propose that some outstanding elements should be selected from the workers to take charge of propaganda work in enterprises and strengthen the Party's propaganda organizations in enterprises. The Northeast Bureau has agreed to this and will make specific regulations separately. However, the increase in the number of people is still very limited. The Party's propaganda department must be good at organizing the forces of all parties to carry out work. This means mobilizing everyone's enthusiasm, especially the responsible cadres in the administration. They understand the overall situation, and their words have a significant effect. Comrade Zhao Lan, Director of the Shenyang Smelting Plant, is very concerned about propaganda and mobilization work in production, so the work there is very good, and production is also very vigorous. Comrade Zhao Lan immediately wrote a letter of condolence when he heard that a worker had smashed his foot. A deputy section chief of the factory was immediately notified with commendations from the factory director, party committee secretary, and trade union chairman after he refused a bribe from a private construction company. These are all very practical and effective propaganda materials and should be used frequently. From the speeches of the comrades, it can be seen that some of our Party's propaganda departments are still not very good at organizing the propaganda forces of all parties, and some even regard the Party's unified leadership as simply "taking over" and thus fail to give play to the role of "collective wisdom and effort." This must be corrected. Of course, the phenomenon of acting independently and not submitting to unified leadership should also be corrected. However, establishing the Party's unified leadership is by no means to weaken or restrict the work enthusiasm of other relevant departments, but precisely to fully utilize and correctly exert this enthusiasm. The correct unified leadership we need in our enterprises is to be able to formulate a work plan to ensure the completion of production tasks in each period, based on the current production tasks and the ideological situation of the workers. The Party's propaganda and mobilization work plan is an important part of this. This propaganda and mobilization work plan should not only specify the regular content of propaganda and mobilization (such as production tasks) and mobilization slogans, but also specify certain temporary content (such as current affairs issues) and specific materials necessary for this period; it should not only specify the implementation steps of the plan (such as the order of work), but also specify the unified distribution of spare time and the various methods of division of labor and cooperation. This plan should be approved by the administration through appropriate procedures to coordinate and assist in the implementation. After the plan is formulated, the responsibility of the leadership lies in timely supervision and inspection, discovering problems at any time, solving difficulties in work, putting forward new slogans, promoting new experiences, and formulating new work plans based on new situations, so as to continuously push the work forward and consolidate and promote production enthusiasm in enterprises. To this end, the Party's propaganda departments in cities and enterprises must always grasp the production situation in the subordinate industrial and mining enterprises, deeply understand the ideological emotions of the workers, closely combine work with production, and discuss and adopt work plans for a certain period through appropriate organizational forms (such as propaganda meetings), so that the entire propaganda organization and various propaganda weapons can fully play their roles and prevent the occurrence of disconnections where work deviates from the center and various parties do not cooperate.
    In order to strengthen the Party's propaganda work, the Party committee's propaganda department must frequently report the work situation to the Party committee and the higher-level propaganda department, make comprehensive and special work reports, so as to obtain timely guidance. The defect that individual provincial and municipal party committees rarely discuss the Party's propaganda work should be corrected.

  IV. Work Hard to Study and Improve Work One Step Further

    In order to complete the above-mentioned political tasks of the Party in enterprises, in addition to practical political mobilization work, it is also necessary to frequently use various organizational forms (group meetings, training classes, supplementary schools, political report meetings, academic lectures, reading rooms, newspaper reading groups, book and newspaper sales offices, etc.) to systematically publicize Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, publicize and interpret the Party's policies, national laws and decrees, and the current international situation. To this end, it is also necessary to organize in-service learning in various enterprises well. The content of this learning should be divided into business learning, cultural and technical learning, and political and theoretical learning according to the different situations of each person. In the past, our regulations stipulated that cadres in industrial and mining enterprises should focus on business learning, and the working masses should focus on cultural and technical learning. The policy is still correct, and we should continue to implement this policy in the future. However, we cannot draw the conclusion from this that the current affairs and policy education of the workers can be dispensed with, the theoretical study of cadres can be simply canceled, or even the decisions and instructions of the Party and the government cannot be discussed. It is not like this at all. Some comrades explained that the reason why they did not convey the instructions and documents of higher authorities well and organize theoretical studies was only a matter of time. I think the main reason is not a matter of time, but a matter of thinking, a matter of organization. In terms of policy, we say "mainly," but not "solely," so we cannot cancel other necessary studies because we emphasize business learning or cultural and technical learning. The experience reflected at this conference also proves that business learning or cultural and technical learning does not take up all the spare time. Some industrial and mining enterprises have also organized current affairs policy education and theoretical studies for some cadres in a timely manner while implementing the policy of focusing on business learning and cultural and technical learning, and it has been proved that as long as the methods are correct and the time is appropriate, these studies are useful and indispensable. If the party member cadres who are in charge of leadership in enterprises have forgotten the importance of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, or even are "busy" to the point that they do not have time to read the policies, decisions, and instructions of the Party and the government, then they must examine their style from the work style, so as not to turn themselves into blind pragmatists. Because this pragmatist style will not only make it impossible to complete the responsibilities entrusted to him by the Party and the country, but will also make things very bad. Changing this situation of neglecting political and theoretical learning is one aspect of strengthening learning; on the other hand, the Party's leading organs must also frequently analyze the situation, sum up experience, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and eliminate the bureaucratic and formalistic styles that are divorced from the masses and divorced from production, so that the Party's propaganda and mobilization work in enterprises can be transformed into a mass-based, diverse, and lively political mobilization, and become a powerful weapon that truly promotes production.

　　东北工矿企业中的宣传鼓动工作
    中共中央东北局宣传部部长  李卓然
    中共中央东北局宣传部，于五月二十日在沈阳召开了东北工矿企业宣传鼓动工作会议。到会者有鞍山、抚顺、沈阳、本溪、哈尔滨、大连、鹤岗、阜新等城市与工矿企业党委的宣传部门负责同志及东北总工会文教部、东北局宣传部直属各文艺部门的干部。会议一致认为：随着生产新纪录运动的开展，企业中党的宣传鼓动工作已显得特别重要。在某些企业中且已作出可观的成绩，应当有系统地加以检查与总结。会上并提出以下几点建议：一、吸收工人中的优秀分子充实企业中的宣传机构；二、由各企业党的组织统一制订一定时期内的宣传鼓动工作的计划；三、加强城市党委对企业宣传鼓动工作的检查与指导，并由东北局宣传部定期召集此种会议，总结经验。
    本文是东北局宣传部部长李卓然同志于五月二十六日在会议上的讲话。
          ——编者
                同志们：
    我们这次会议开得很好，在小组及大会的讨论中都反映了目前工作的实际情况，提出了一些新的问题，交换了许多值得推广的宝贵经验，批评了某些脱离群众的形式主义的作风，这些对于我们今后工作的改进都是很有益处的。当然，我们在企业中有系统地建立党的宣传鼓动工作还只是开始，成绩还是初步的，对于工矿企业中的实际情况和工作经验的研究和总结也还是很不够的。
    昨日东北局会议，高岗同志特别指示我们不要满足于已有成绩，而要更深入地进行工作，更好的组织大家学习，我们应当坚决执行这个指示。现在会议快要结束了，特就同志们所提出的问题，发表一点意见，请考虑：
  一、企业中宣传鼓动工作的任务和作用
    党在工矿企业中进行宣传鼓动工作的任务，在于启发和提高工人阶级的马列主义和毛泽东思想的政治觉悟，在我伟大祖国全体人民利益的目标下，发扬工人群众的生产热情和创造性，巩固工厂中的劳动纪律和生产秩序，同一切铺张浪费和损害国家财产的现象作斗争，鼓励工程师、技术人员和职员们热心服务、精通业务，使劳动与科学技术相结合，争取最好的完成和超过国家的生产计划。
    因此，党所领导的宣传鼓动工作在一切企业中都是很重要的工作，它是推进生产的武器，谁要是放松了这种工作，谁就会直接减弱企业中的生产积极性，妨碍国家生产计划的完成。沈阳冶炼厂关于宣传鼓动工作的总结中指出：“冶炼厂的宣传鼓动工作已经成为一种推动生产的有力武器了，它是随着新纪录运动的展开而逐渐加强起来的，从前是零散自流的，没有加以重视和组织，由于宣传鼓动工作对于新纪录运动的开展起了重大的推动作用，领导方面便意识到这是推动生产不可忽视的力量了。”我认为这种估计是合乎实际情况的。
  二、宣传鼓动工作必须密切结合生产
    在讨论中有几位同志提出，企业中的宣传鼓动工作必须与生产结合，不了解生产技术过程，不倾听工人意见，不了解他们心目中的问题，就无法提出切合实际的宣传鼓动口号，这是很对的。从材料上和同志们的发言中所述大连玻璃厂、沈阳冶炼厂、皇姑屯铁路工厂及其他工矿企业中的许多经验都证明了这种见解的正确性，如大连玻璃工厂为了超额完成一九五○年的生产任务，经党、团、工会共同研究后提出了密切结合生产技术的四个动员口号：（１）保大窑（即保证大窑一年不修理）；（２）七十一秒（即由原计划的八十五秒钟减到七十一秒就要抽出一张一·七二米宽一·二四○米长的玻璃）；（３）九○扣（即一张玻璃要保持百分之九十的成品，只割去百分之十的废边）；（４）学习苏联新的技术和方法。在这些口号下发动了生产竞赛，推动了该厂生产任务的完成以至超过。沈阳冶炼厂为了克服严寒时期“冻矿难上”的困难，支部书记就在支部大会上提出：“党员带头突破冻矿难上”，结果出现了一个克服困难的竞赛运动，冻矿难打难上的困难果然被克服了。原料的供给得到了保证，下块率增加了百分之三十。又该厂某车间提出“现场就是课堂，事故就是教材”的口号，结果动员了一些技术人员深入现场寻求解决技术上的困难。皇姑屯铁路机械厂三月份的修车任务表上十四个火车头上都挂着白旗，每个车头上写着它的型号，每一辆机车修好后，就把白旗染成红旗，修好一部分就染红一部分，这样全厂的工友可以清楚的知道完成了多少任务，还有多少没完成，进展慢的就要加紧工作，实际上对生产起了督促的作用。该厂翻砂部陈占普组的工友因气缸套出了砂眼，被画在宣传画上，大家都觉得耻辱，陈占普说：“我脸上真有些挂不住，今后一定要好好想办法把砂眼克服。”此外，如某些工厂中的废品展览会、车间生产会议、生动显目的黑板报、图画报、生产图表以及铁路上的“光荣台”与“事故品展览台”等等宣传鼓动形式，都证明了很受群众欢迎，在企业中起了及时的推动作用。这些好的口号和形式都是由于领导上深入实际且善于体会群众的创造而出现了的，仔细研究他们的经验就知道我们今后应当怎样工作了。
  三、充实宣传机构，实现统一领导
    目前工矿企业中的宣传机构是不充实的，同志们提议应当从工人中挑选一些优秀分子来担任企业中的宣传工作并充实企业中党的宣传组织。这点东北局已同意，将另作具体规定。但人数的增加还是很有限的。党的宣传部门要善于组织各方面的力量来进行工作。这就是发动大家的积极性，特别是行政上的负责干部，他们了解全面情况，说话作用大，沈阳冶炼厂厂长赵岚同志，很关心生产中的宣传鼓动工作，所以那里的工作很好，生产也很起劲。赵岚同志听见一个工友砸了脚立即写了慰问信。该厂某副股长因拒绝私营建筑公司的贿赂，立即张贴了厂长、党委书记、工会主任的奖励他的通报。这些都是很实际很有效的宣传材料，应当经常利用。从同志们的发言中看出我们某些党的宣传部门至今还不大会组织各方面的宣传力量，有的竟把党的统一领导看成就是简单的“包办”，从而未能发挥“群策群力”的作用，这是必须加以改正的。当然，各自为政不服从统一领导的现象也是应当纠正的。但建立党的统一领导，绝不是要削弱或限制其他有关部门的工作积极性，而正是为了充分利用和正确发挥这种积极性。我们企业中所需要的这种正确的统一领导就是要在每个时期，能根据当前的生产任务和职工中的思想状况，订出保证完成生产任务的工作计划，党的宣传鼓动工作计划就是其中的一个重要部分。这种宣传鼓动工作计划不仅要规定宣传鼓动的经常内容（如生产任务）和动员口号而且要规定这时期所必需的某些临时内容（如时事问题）和具体材料；不仅要规定计划的执行步骤（如工作先后），而且要规定工余时间的统一分配和分工合作的各项办法。此项计划，应经过适当手续，取得行政上的同意，以便配合和帮助进行。计划订定后领导方面的责任在于及时督促检查，随时发现问题，解决工作中的困难，提出新的口号，推广新的经验，并根据新的情况，制订新的工作计划，以便把工作不断推向前进，巩固和发扬企业中的生产积极性。为此，城市和企业中党的宣传部门必须经常掌握所属工矿企业中的生产情况，深入了解工人的思想情绪，使工作与生产密切结合，并通过适当组织形式（如宣传会议）讨论和通过一定时期的工作计划，使整个宣传机构和各种宣传武器均能充分发挥作用，并防止发生工作离开中心，各方不相配合的脱节现象。
    为了加强党的宣传工作，党委宣传部门必须经常向党委和上级宣传部反映工作情况，作综合的和专题的工作报告，以便取得适时的指导。个别省、市党委很少讨论党的宣传工作的缺点是应当注意改正的。
  四、努力学习把工作提高一步
    为要完成上述党在企业中的政治任务，除了切合实际的政治鼓动工作外，还必须经常利用各种组织形式（小组会、训练班、补习学校、政治报告会、学术讲座、阅览室、读报组、书报推销处等），有系统地宣传马列主义、毛泽东思想，宣传和解释党的政策、国家的法令以及目前的国际形势。为此，又必须很好的组织各企业中的在职学习。此项学习内容应按各人的不同情况分为业务学习，文化技术学习及政治、理论学习等方面。过去我们规定：工矿企业中干部应以业务学习为主，工人群众应以文化技术学习为主的方针仍然是正确的，今后还是要执行这样的方针。但不能从此作出结论说工人的时事政策教育可以不要了，干部中的理论学习可以干脆取消了，甚至连党和政府的决定指示也可以不讨论了。完全不是这样的。有些同志解释没有很好传达上级指示文件及组织理论学习的原因只是时间问题。我想主要还不是时间问题，而是一个思想问题，一个组织问题。在方针上我们说的“为主”，但不是说“唯一”，所以不能因为强调业务学习或文化技术学习就取消其他必要的学习。这次会议上所反映的经验也证明并不是业务学习或文化技术学习把工余的一切时间都占去了。有的工矿企业在执行以业务学习、文化技术学习为主的方针下，还及时的组织了时事政策教育和部分干部的理论学习，并证明这种学习只要方法对头、时间适当，都是很有用处的与不可缺少的。如果在企业中负领导责任的党员干部竟忘记了学习马列主义和毛泽东思想的重要，甚至“忙”到连党和政府的政策、决议、指示也无暇看了，那就必须从作风上加以检讨，以免把自己变成盲目的事务主义者。因为这种事务主义的作风不仅会使党和国家所付托他的责任不能完成，而且会把事情弄得很坏。改变这种忽视政治理论学习的情况，就是加强学习的一个方面；另一方面党的领导机关又必须根据中央和东北局的指示经常分析情况、总结经验，展开批评与自我批评，肃清那些脱离群众、脱离生产的官僚主义和形式主义的作风，以便把党在企业中的宣传鼓动工作变为群众性、多样性和生动活泼的政治动员，变为真正推动生产的有力武器。
