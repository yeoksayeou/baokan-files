Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th. The Northeast People's Government, in order to better develop the Northeast economy and facilitate the exchange of goods between the Luda area and other parts of Northeast China, has decided, with the approval of the Central People's Government, to exchange the Kwantung currency issued by the Luda Administrative Office for Northeast currency. The exchange rate is 270 Northeast currency yuan for 1 Kwantung currency yuan, and it is stipulated that the exchange will be completed within eight days from the 16th to the 23rd of this month. At the same time, from the 16th, the Luda Kwantung Bank will be renamed the Luda Branch of the Northeast Bank. Note: For several years, because the value of the Northeast currency was not yet stable, in order to avoid affecting the economic construction of the Luda area, the Northeast People's Government decided that the area should adopt a stable currency system issued by the area. However, since the complete liberation of the Northeast more than a year ago, the Northeast currency has been completely stabilized, and there is no need for the Luda area to maintain a separate currency system. Therefore, the Northeast People's Government has made the above decision.

　　东北区统一币制
    本月底前兑回旅大关东币
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】东北人民政府为更好地发展东北经济、便利旅大地区与东北其他地区的物资交流，经呈请中央人民政府批准后，决定将旅大行政公署发行的关东币以东北币兑回。兑换比值为东北币二七○元换关东币一元，规定自本月十六日起至二十三日止八天内兑完。同时，自十六日起，改旅大关东银行为东北银行旅大分行。按：数年来由于东北币值尚未稳定，为着避免影响旅大地区经济建设的进行，东北人民政府曾决定该区采取本区发行的稳定的币制。但自东北全境解放后一年多以来，东北币已经完全稳定，旅大区已没有保持单独的币制的必要，故东北人民政府有上述决定。
