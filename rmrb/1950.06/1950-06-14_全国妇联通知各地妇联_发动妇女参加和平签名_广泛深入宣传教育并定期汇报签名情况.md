Xinhua News Agency, June 12th. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently issued another notice to local women's federations and affiliated member organizations, calling on them to continue to extensively and deeply publicize and mobilize women to enthusiastically participate in the peace signature campaign, in order to demonstrate the powerful force of the vast number of Chinese women in opposing wars of aggression and defending world peace. The notice pointed out that before launching the signature campaign, it is necessary to understand the specific local conditions at the time and the level of awareness of various different target groups, and to conduct propaganda and explanation of the peace signature campaign accordingly. After the signature campaign, mass feedback should be collected and propaganda and education should continue.

The notice stated that the first step in launching the signature campaign should be to conduct it among organized women's groups in all walks of life, all social strata, and all ethnic groups. If the above-mentioned organizations have already started or other groups are responsible for leading this campaign, local women's federations should pay attention to conducting publicity among unorganized workers' families, staff families, parents of students, urban housewives, and rural women. In areas where there are branches of the World Peace Congress, the women's federations should cooperate with the overall movement to publicize and call on women to participate. In areas where there are no branches of the Peace Congress, the women's federations should jointly launch and divide the work with local trade unions, the New Democratic Youth League, the Democratic Youth Federation, the Student Federation, and other people's organizations to carry out this movement. The notice requires local women's federations to send the number of organized women participating in the signature campaign, the situation, and a written summary to the All-China Democratic Women's Federation as soon as possible before the end of June, and to send a report on the signature situation of unorganized women between the end of July and mid-August, so as to collect and forward it to the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace.

　　全国妇联通知各地妇联  发动妇女参加和平签名
    广泛深入宣传教育并定期汇报签名情况
    【新华社十二日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会顷向各地妇联及所属会员团体再度发出通知，号召它们继续广泛地、深入地宣传并动员妇女群众，热烈参加和平签名运动，以表示中国广大妇女反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的强大力量。通知指出：在发动签名之前，必须了解当时当地具体情况和各种不同对象的觉悟程度，据此来进行和平签名运动的宣传解释。在签名之后，应搜集群众反映，继续进行宣传教育。
    通知称：发动签名运动的步骤，首先应在各行各业，各阶层、各民族有组织的妇女群众中进行。如在上述组织中已经开始进行或已有其他团体负责领导这一运动时，各地妇联即应注意在无组织的工人家属、职员家属、学生家长、城市家庭妇女和农村妇女中进行宣传。凡有保卫世界和平大会分会的地区，妇联应配合整个运动宣传并号召妇女参加。凡没有和平大会分会的地区，妇联应与当地的总工会、新民主主义青年团、民主青年联合会、学生联合会等人民团体共同发动和分工进行这一运动。通知要求各地妇联尽可能于六月底以前将有组织的妇女参加签名的人数、情况及书面总结寄给全国民主妇联，并于七月底至八月中旬将无组织的妇女的签名情况的汇报寄来，以便汇集转报中国保卫世界和平大会委员会。
