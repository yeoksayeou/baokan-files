　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd. Shenyang and Harbin, the two major economic centers of North and South Manchuria, have recently held their second People's Representative Conferences. Both city conferences focused on discussing and resolving issues related to adjusting the relationship between public and private enterprises, in order to further develop economic construction. Both conferences acted on behalf of the Municipal People's Congress, electing mayors, deputy mayors, and committee members to form the Municipal People's Government Committee.

　　The Second Shenyang Municipal People's Representative Conference was held from the 12th to the 15th of this month. The conference heard Mayor Zhu Qiwen's report "Striving to Further Restore and Develop Shenyang's Public and Private Economy." In his report, Mayor Zhu first pointed out that over the past year, the production of public and private enterprises in Shenyang has greatly developed, more than 100,000 unemployed workers at the time of liberation have gained employment, and the living standards of the working people have been initially improved. Next, Mayor Zhu analyzed the difficulties and their causes in the restoration and development process of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and pointed out that under the leadership and support of public enterprises, they have been developing normally since October of last year. In order to further adjust the relationship between public and private enterprises in Shenyang on the existing basis, Mayor Zhu finally put forward specific methods in his report regarding the resolution of processing and ordering between public and private enterprises, the supply of raw materials to private enterprises, the trial establishment of joint ventures, conversion, the adjustment of the relationship between state-owned commerce and private commerce, and the adjustment of labor-management relations, for the conference to discuss. During the group and plenary discussions, all representatives unanimously agreed that Mayor Zhu's analysis and proposed methods were completely in line with the actual situation, and they actively offered many suggestions in connection with their own problems. The conference unanimously adopted the above report and made a resolution, calling on the people of the city to work together to further develop the economy. Subsequently, the conference discussed and approved the Municipal People's Government's work plan and revenue and expenditure budget for this year. Finally, the conference democratically elected the mayor, deputy mayors, and municipal committee members, and elected Huang Oudong and 34 others to form the Second People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee.

　　The Second Harbin Municipal People's Representative Conference was held from the 8th to the 11th of this month. The conference focused on discussing the issues of processing and ordering in the relationship between public and private enterprises. The conference believed that the processing and ordering method not only solved the capital and raw material difficulties of private enterprises, but also enabled the production and equipment of many private enterprises to expand day by day; at the same time, it also combined the production of private enterprises with the needs of national economic construction, strengthening the planning of operations. The conference studied and approved the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Processing and Ordering Contracts in Harbin." In his concluding report, Mayor Rao Bin pointed out that the relationship between public and private enterprises in Harbin has been adjusted over the past few years and is relatively normal. However, due to the increasing stabilization of prices recently, the disappearance of false purchasing power, and the consequent reduction in the scope of speculative activities by some private capital, new difficulties have arisen, requiring further adjustment. He criticized some incorrect practices in the past relationship between public and private enterprises, and called on both public and private enterprises to resolutely abide by the provisional measures for the management of processing and ordering contracts passed by the conference. At the end of the conference, after full deliberation and consultation, the mayor, deputy mayors, and municipal committee members were elected.

　　沈阳、哈尔滨两市
    举行第二届人民代表会议
    代行人民代表大会职权选出市长及市府委员
    【新华社沈阳二十三日电】南北满两大经济中心的沈阳市和哈尔滨市，已于最近相继举行第二届各界人民代表会议。两市会议都着重讨论并解决了关于调整公、私企业关系的问题，以进一步发展经济建设。会议都代行了市人民代表大会的职权，选举了市长、副市长及委员，组成市人民政府委员会。
    沈阳市第二届各界人民代表会议于本月十二日至十五日举行。会议听取了朱其文市长“为进一步恢复发展沈阳市公私经济而奋斗”的报告。朱市长在其报告中首先指出：一年多来沈阳公、私企业生产有了巨大发展，解放时的十余万失业职工均已获得职业，劳动人民的生活已获得初步改善。接着，朱市长分析了私营工商业在恢复和发展过程中的困难及其原因，并指出在公营企业的领导和扶助下自去年十月已获得正常发展。为了在已有的基础上，进一步调整沈阳市公私企业关系，朱市长最后在报告中提出了关于解决公私企业间的加工、订货，私营企业的原料供应，试办联营公司，转业，调整国营商业与私营商业的关系，调整劳资关系等方面的具体办法，供会议讨论。在分组及大会讨论中，全体代表一致认为朱市长的分析和所提办法完全切合实际情况，并纷纷联系自己的问题，提出许多积极的建议。会议一致通过以上报告，并作出决议，号召全市人民共同为进一步发展经济而努力。接着，会议讨论并通过了市人民政府本年度的工作计划和收支预算。最后，会议民主选出正、副市长和市府委员，并选出黄欧东等三十五人组成第二届各界人民代表会议协商委员会。
    哈尔滨市第二届各界人民代表会议于本月八日至十一日举行。会议集中讨论了公、私企业关系中的加工和订货问题。会议认为：加工和订货的办法，不仅解决了私营企业的资金和原料困难，并且使很多私营企业的生产和设备日益扩大；同时更使私营企业的生产与国家经济建设需要相结合，加强了经营上的计划性。会议研究并通过了“哈尔滨市关于订立加工定货合同管理暂行办法”。饶斌市长在总结报告中指出：数年来哈市公、私关系是经过调整的，也是比较正常的。但由于近来物价日益稳定，虚假购买力消失，有些私人资本投机活动的范围从而大减，因此又产生了新的困难，需要再度调整。他批判了过去公私关系中某些不正确的作法，号召公、私企业双方坚决遵守会议通过的加工订货合同管理暂行办法。会议最后经过充分酝酿和协商，选举了市长、副市长及市府委员。
