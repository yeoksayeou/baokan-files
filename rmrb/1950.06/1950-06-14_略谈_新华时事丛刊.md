　　A Brief Discussion on "Xinhua Current Affairs Series"
    Li Min
    The "Xinhua Current Affairs Series," edited by the Xinhua Current Affairs Series Publishing House and distributed by Xinhua Bookstore, has published over forty issues since its inception in September last year.

    Apart from a portion of translated manuscripts, the vast majority of the materials in this series are selected from documents, papers, and materials published by the Central People's Government and various newspapers and magazines. Regarding important current domestic and international issues, this series strives to provide a systematic reflection.

    The materials in newspapers and magazines are vast and numerous, making it impossible for the average reader to read them all, let alone purchase and save them. Even if they are saved, it would be inconvenient to use them without some form of organization—creating an index or clipping. Organizing newspapers and magazines is a heavy task that only a few libraries and archives can manage; it is difficult for individuals to accomplish. In this regard, the Xinhua Current Affairs Series provides great help to the average reader.

    Last year, when the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference successfully concluded and the Central People's Government was established, the Current Affairs Series successively compiled "Important Documents," "Speeches, Reports, and Remarks," "Interviews with Representatives," and "The Birth of New China," totaling four volumes. These booklets are not only convenient for readers to study and research but also have long-term preservation value.

    The Fourth United Nations General Assembly opened on September 20th and closed on December 11th last year, lasting 83 days. The speeches, lectures, and proposals by the Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky totaled 30, scattered across newspapers over two months. The Current Affairs Series compiled "A Collection of Speeches by Vyshinsky and Others at the Fourth United Nations General Assembly," which is very helpful for those studying international issues.

    "The Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference" collected all the relevant materials from this conference. Compiling a special volume for this conference, which "represents the unprecedented great unity of the working class of Asia and Australia," is meaningful.

    According to the copyright page, the print run of "The New Sino-Soviet Treaty" and "Historical Materials on Sino-Soviet Relations" has reached 60,000 and 30,000 copies, respectively, in the North China region alone, demonstrating the readers' need for them.

    The liberation of Taiwan and Tibet is a matter of great concern for the people of the whole country. Therefore, the Current Affairs Series timely compiled "The Taiwan Issue" and "Tibet Awaiting Liberation."

    "The Work of Unifying National Financial and Economic Affairs" collects various decisions, reports, and regulations on financial and economic issues announced from the fourth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2nd last year to the 22nd administrative meeting of the Government Administration Council in March this year. This is an essential handbook for those engaged in economic work and research.

    "Labor-Capital Relations and Collective Contracts" collects relevant documents and experiences from various cities and industries in signing collective contracts, which is very useful for cadres engaged in production administration, labor administration, and trade union work, as well as for the industrial and commercial sectors.

    The first essay of "The Operation and Management of State-Owned Enterprises in Northeast China" is an editorial from the "People's Daily" titled "Learn to Manage Enterprises." The content is divided into four parts: 1. Economic Accounting System; 2. Enterprise Management and Labor Organization; 3. Wages and Quotas; 4. Record-Breaking and Rationalization. Currently, everyone is studying Comrade Gao Gang's "Standing at the Forefront of Northeast Economic Construction," and this is a very useful reference book.

    "Protecting the Property of the People's Motherland" is not only a textbook for economic construction cadres but also a book that every literate citizen should read carefully, because cherishing state property is a common virtue of all citizens.

    "The Embryo of Industrial China" and "Tianjin Industry After Liberation" introduce the industrial exhibitions of Dalian and Tianjin. Reading these two books can increase our confidence in the future of China's industrialization.

    "The Sixteen Union Republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics," "The 32nd Anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution," "From Lenin to Stalin," "The 1950 Soviet Supreme Soviet Election," and "The Soviet Method of Industrialization" are popular booklets introducing the Soviet Union.

    "The Czechoslovakian Experiment in Nationalization" and "The Czechoslovakian School Reform" introduce the experiences of the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe in economic and cultural construction, which is meaningful for our New Democratic construction.

    "The Three Major Resolutions of the Cominform Meeting" (Revised Edition) contains the three resolutions passed at the Cominform meeting in November last year: "Defense of Peace and the Struggle Against Warmongers," "The Unity of the Working Class and the Tasks of Communist and Workers' Parties," and "The Yugoslav Communist Party in the Hands of Murderers and Spies." These resolutions are of great significance for all Communist and Workers' Parties and for the entire international working-class movement.

    "The Economic Crisis in Capitalist Countries" is a collection of more than ten essays by famous Soviet economists such as Leontiev, providing authoritative data and analysis on the current state of the economic crisis in the aging capitalist countries led by the United States and Britain.

    "The Struggle Between Progressive and Reactionary Forces in the United States" was written by the Soviet Vronsky. This is a useful reading for studying the political situation in the United States. When reading this book, it is best to also read Foster's "The Twilight of World Capitalism."

    "A Brief History of American Aggression Against China" was written by Liu Danian. It exposes the consistent aggressive behavior of American aggressors against China based on historical facts over the past century.

    "The Shenyang American Espionage Case," "The Hungarian Treason Case," "The Bulgarian Treason Case," and "The Righteous Trial" (the Soviet trial of Japanese germ warfare criminals) expose the despicable conspiracies of American imperialism and the inhumane crimes of Japanese imperialism.

    "The Labour Party as Seen from the British General Election" and "The Road to the Liberation of the British People" (the political report of Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, at the 21st Congress of the CPGB) are two important materials for studying the current situation in Britain.

    "The Struggle for Liberation of the People in Colonies and Semi-Colonies After the Second World War" and "The New Stage of the Indian People's National Liberation Struggle" discuss the revolutionary struggles in colonies and semi-colonies. The tremendous progress in the revolutionary liberation struggles of dependent countries and colonies after the war has shaken the very foundation of the entire capitalist system, demonstrating that the colonial people are no longer willing to live in the old ways, and the ruling classes of the colonial powers can no longer rule them in the old ways. This situation can be seen from these two books.

    As mentioned earlier, the Current Affairs Series has published more than forty issues. I have only mentioned a portion of the book titles, and the rest will not be listed one by one.

    Although the Current Affairs Series has made great contributions to readers, it still has many shortcomings: First, the scope of its compilation seems to be not broad enough. Judging from the forty-odd issues that have already been published, about thirty are in the political category, ten are in the economic category, and only two or three are about education and health. This does not mean that the number of political volumes should be reduced in the future, but rather that the number of volumes in other categories should be increased. Secondly, the work of timely reflecting issues and providing timely supplies to readers is poorly done. Many books are published too slowly. It is especially regrettable that Xinhua Bookstore has paid too little attention to the publicity and introduction of this series. Although such a large set of series has been published, it has not attracted widespread attention from readers. This is a great loss in political education work and cultural work, and efforts should be made to make up for it!

　　略谈“新华时事丛刊”
    李敏
    新华时事丛刊社编辑、新华书店发行的“新华时事丛刊”，从去年九月创始到现在为止，已陆续出版了四十余册。
    这个丛刊，除了一部分翻译稿之外，绝大部分的材料都是选自中央人民政府和各报纸杂志上发表过的文件、论文和资料。对于当前国内外重要的问题，这个丛刊，努力地作着有系统的反映。
    报纸杂志的材料浩如烟海，一般读者不可能普遍阅读，更不要说购备保存了。即使保存了，如果不加一番整理工作——做索引或剪贴，使用起来也很不方便。报纸杂志的整理是一件繁重的工作，只有少数图书馆、资料室才能办到，个人的力量是难以胜任的。新华时事丛刊在这一点上，对一般读者的帮助是很大的。
    去年当中国人民政协会议胜利闭幕和中央人民政府成立时，时事丛刊曾连续编成“重要文献”，“讲话、报告、发言”、“代表访问记”、“新中国的诞生”等四册，这些小册子不仅便于读者学习研究，而且有长期保存的价值。
    第四届联合国大会是去年九月二十日开幕的，到十二月十一日闭幕，历时八十三日。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基等的发言、讲演、提案共有三十篇之多，散见于两个多月的报纸上。时事丛刊编了“第四届联合国大会维辛斯基等讲演集”，对于研究国际问题的人很有帮助。
    “亚洲澳洲工会代表会议”搜集了这个会议的全部有关材料。为这个“表示着亚澳两洲工人阶级空前大团结的”会议编印一个专册，是有意义的。
    “中苏友好新条约”，“中苏关系史料”，据这两册书版权页刊载的印数，单在华北区前者已达六万册，后者已达三万册，可见读者对它的需要。
    台湾和西藏的解放，是全国人民所十分关心的问题，因此时事丛刊适时地编印了“台湾问题”和“待解放的西藏”。
    “统一国家财政经济工作”收集了去年十二月二日中央人民政府委员会第四次会议以来到今年三月政务院第二十二次政务会议所公布的关于财经问题的各项决定、报告和条例，这是从事经济工作和研究经济问题者必备的手册。
    “劳资关系与集体合同”收集了有关的文件和各大城市各行各业签订集体合同的经验，对于担任生产行政工作、劳动行政工作和工会工作的干部和工商界很有用处。
    “东北公营企业的经营与管理”第一篇代序是“人民日报”的社论“学会管理企业”，内容分四部分：一、经济核算制；二、企业管理与劳动组织；三、工资与定额；四、创纪录与合理化。目前大家正在学习高岗同志的“站在东北经济建设的最前面”，这是一本很有用的参考书。
    “保护人民祖国的财产”，这不仅是经建干部的课本，而且是每一个能读书的公民应该细读的书，因为爱护国家财产是全体国民的公德。
    “工业中国的雏型”和“解放后的天津工业”是介绍大连和天津的工业展览的。读了这两本书，可以使我们对中国工业化的前途增加信心。
    “苏联社会主义共和国联盟十六加盟共和国”，“苏联十月革命节三十二周年纪念”，“从列宁到斯大林”，“一九五○年苏联最高苏维埃选举”和“苏联工业化方法”，是介绍苏联的通俗小册子。
    “捷克国有化的尝试”和“捷克的学校改革”，介绍东欧人民民主国家经济文化建设的经验对于我们的新民主主义建设是有意义的。
    “共产党情报局会议三大决议”（增订本），包含去年十一月情报局会议上通过的“保卫和平与对战争贩子的斗争”、“工人阶级的团结与共产党及工人党的任务”、“在杀人犯与间谍掌握中的南斯拉夫共产党”三项决议，这些决议对于所有的共产党与工人党，对于整个国际工人阶级的运动，具有极大的意义。
    “资本主义国家的经济危机”，这是苏联名经济学家列昂节夫等十余篇论文的结集，对于以美英为首的衰老的资本主义国家经济危机的现状提供了权威的资料，并且作了分析。
    “美国进步力量与反动力量的斗争”是苏联伏龙斯基作的。这是研究美国政治情况的有益读物，读这书时最好同时读一读福斯特的“世界资本主义的末日”。
    “美国侵华简史”，刘大年著。它从近百余年来的历史事实上揭发了美国侵略者对中国一贯的侵略行为。
    “沈阳美国间谍案”、“匈牙利叛国案”、“保加利亚叛国案”、“正义的审讯”（苏联审讯日本细菌战犯经过），这几本书揭露了美国帝国主义的卑鄙的阴谋，和日本帝国主义的灭绝人性的罪恶。
    “从英国大选看工党”和“英国人民解放的道路”（英共总书记波立特在英共第二十一届大会上的政治报告）是研究英国当前情况的两种重要材料。
    “第二次世界大战后殖民地与半殖民地人民解放斗争”和“印度人民民族解放斗争新阶段”是论述殖民地半殖民地的革命斗争的。战后附属国与殖民地的革命解放斗争的巨大进展，动摇了整个资本主义制度的基础本身，表现出殖民地人民再也不愿在旧的方式下生活，殖民地宗主国的统治阶级再也不能用旧的方式统治他们了。这种情形，从这两册书可以看出来。
    如前面所说，时事丛刊已经出版了四十余种，我只提出了其中一部分的书名，其余的不一一列举了。
    时事丛刊对读者虽然有了很大的贡献，可是还有着不少的缺点：第一，它所编选的范围似乎还不够宽广。就已经出版的四十几册来看，属于政治类的约三十种，经济类的十余种，其他关于教育卫生的只有二三种。这并不是说今后要减少政治类的册子，而是说应当增多其他门类的册子。其次是及时反映问题，及时供应读者的工作做的很差。有好些书籍，出版得太慢。尤其可惜的是新华书店对这个丛刊的宣传介绍工作太不注意了，虽然出版了册数这么多的一套丛刊，但并没有引起读者普遍的注意。这是政治教育工作和文化工作上的一个很大的损失，应当努力补偿起来！
