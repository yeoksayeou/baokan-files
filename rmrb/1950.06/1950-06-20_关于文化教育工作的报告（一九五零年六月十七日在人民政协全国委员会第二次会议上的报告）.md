Chairman Guo Moruo, members, comrades:

On behalf of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council, I am reporting to the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the national cultural and educational work.

My report will cover three issues: First, an overview of the national political learning movement; second, an overview of the national cultural and educational construction work; third, several issues in the implementation of cultural and educational policies.

I. An Overview of the National People's Political Learning Movement

I would like to first explain the current political learning movement of the Chinese people.

Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, a large-scale learning movement has unfolded across the country. This learning movement is a movement by the liberated people to educate and transform themselves using democratic methods, and also the foundation for our general cultural and educational work. The development and achievements of this movement deserve special attention. Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Having a people's state, the people have the possibility of educating and reforming themselves on a national scale and on an all-round basis by democratic methods, so as to free themselves from the influence of domestic and foreign reactionaries (this influence is still very great and will exist for a long time and cannot be quickly eliminated), to reform the old habits and bad ideas they have acquired from the old society, to prevent themselves from going down the wrong path indicated by the reactionaries, and to continue to advance towards socialism and communism." The content of the current grand-scale learning movement is precisely this.

The gains of this learning movement can be roughly summarized in the following points:

First, through the study of the three major documents of the CPPCC, especially the "Common Program," the broad masses of the people have clearly recognized the fundamental differences between the new China and the old China. The people across the country, especially workers and peasants, have enhanced their sense of being the masters of the new China. The unity of all nationalities in the new China has also been greatly strengthened. Many old intellectuals and public educators have made self-criticisms of their past erroneous ideas. The influence of the erroneous ideas of the so-called "middle road" has been basically cleared away.

Second, the broad masses of the people have also made great progress in their understanding of the world's two major camps—the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the imperialist aggressive camp headed by U.S. imperialism. Through the education of the diplomatic struggles since the founding of the People's Republic of China, including the criticism movement of the White Paper and the learning movement of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the broad masses of the people have recognized the aggressive face and expansionist ambitions of U.S. imperialism; recognized that U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are the mortal enemies of the Chinese people; and recognized that it is U.S. imperialism that is deliberately attempting to provoke a new world war. The great friendship of the Soviet Union towards the Chinese people has also forcefully refuted the shameless slanders of Chinese and foreign reactionaries. Replacing the suspicion and misunderstanding of the Soviet Union that the imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries had long propagated, the broad masses of the people have recognized that the Soviet Union is the closest friend of the Chinese people; recognized that the Soviet Union is the pillar of world peace; and recognized that the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty is not only beneficial to the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union, but also greatly beneficial to the defense of world peace. In the world's two major camps, there is no middle road, and China must stand on the side of the socialist Soviet Union. The fact that the strength of the world peace and democracy camp has exceeded the strength of the imperialist aggressive camp has greatly enhanced the Chinese people's confidence in victory in the struggle against imperialism. The movement to defend world peace has been increasingly unfolding across the country, and the number of people who have signed the declaration of the World Peace Congress has reached over ten million as of now.

Third, among the broad masses of working people and intellectuals, the view that labor creates civilization has been basically established. Labor has become a glorious thing. Working people have begun to be generally respected. In many factories and mines, workers have launched production competitions and new record movements.

Fourth, the viewpoint of serving the people has become widespread among intellectuals and government workers. After studying, the broad masses of intellectuals and young students participated in revolutionary work and construction work. Most of them have worked hard, demonstrated initiative in their work, and achieved results.

Thus, due to the ideological awakening of the broad masses of the people, our people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated, the cause of national construction has been advanced, and the forces for defending world peace have been expanded.

This is a great victory on the ideological front.

Needless to say, this victory is a reflection in consciousness of the entire revolutionary victory, and it is the result of Chairman Mao's correct leadership, the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, and the efforts and promotion of workers in all fields.

This nationwide learning movement has mainly gone through the following methods:

First, it is the establishment of political universities and political training classes in various places. According to incomplete statistics, more than 470,000 people have already participated in these schools and training classes. In terms of social composition, these participants include college and middle school students, vocational youths, workers, farmers, former public educators, freelancers, housewives, merchants, etc., among whom the most are intellectuals and young students. In terms of political composition, it includes the Communist Party, various democratic parties, non-party members, and even those who participated in reactionary parties and groups in the past.

Second, it is the organization of ideological learning for general college and middle school students and teachers. After liberation in various places, political courses were generally established in universities and middle schools, teaching courses such as the history of social development, political economy, and new democracy. Learning was also generally organized among teachers. After learning, 20 percent of college and middle school students across the country have joined the New Democratic Youth League.

Third, it is the organization of learning for workers, farmers, and citizens. At the beginning of liberation in various places, trade unions and public enterprises and organizations first launched a warm political learning movement. After the workers' political awareness was raised, they generally demanded further improvement of cultural, technical, and political knowledge, so workers' night schools and spare-time cultural schools were established one after another in various places. According to incomplete statistics, more than 500,000 workers are currently participating in this type of cultural and technical learning. An important method of farmer learning is winter school, and the number of people participating in winter school this past winter and spring was ten million. In terms of citizens, spare-time supplementary schools have played a great role. According to statistics at the end of last year, there were approximately 14,000 such schools across the country, with nearly 700,000 students.

In addition, government cultural and educational departments have also organized literary and artistic propaganda, news and broadcasting education, exhibitions of scientific materials and cultural relics, and a large number of publications and distributions of learning books and periodicals to promote this learning movement. According to statistics from bookstores in North China, East China, and Northeast China, a total of 1,013,500 copies of revolutionary theory and policy documents were printed from January to March of this year. The social science lectures recently held by the Central People's Broadcasting Station contacted 206 organized basic listener units in 20 provinces in two months. The drama "Red Flag Song" was performed more than 110 times in Shanghai, breaking the record for Chinese dramas throughout history. These few examples also reflect the extensiveness of the people's learning movement.

Although the liberated people have already shown such great achievements in self-education and self-transformation, we must see that the development of the movement is only in its preliminary stage. We must strengthen the planning of our work to adapt to the further development of this movement and consolidate our existing achievements. Undeniably, there are still many shortcomings in our work. In particular, although we have done a lot of general propaganda for the fundamental law "Common Program," it is relatively empty and lacks in-depth understanding that meets specific needs. These shortcomings should be overcome in future work.

II. An Overview of National Cultural and Educational Construction Work

Now I will talk about the overview of national cultural and educational construction work. The legacy of cultural and educational undertakings that we inherited from the old China was very poor and weak. The quantity was very insufficient, and much of the content could not meet the needs of the people. The old liberated areas did a part of very good cultural and educational work in the past, but the quantity of this work was even smaller. In order to facilitate everyone's understanding of the situation, I will introduce here a few main figures in the six aspects of education, health, science, art, news, and publishing:

(1) Education: According to existing incomplete materials, there are 227 institutions of higher learning in the country, with more than 134,000 students; 3,690 secondary schools, with more than 1,090,000 students; 212,890 primary schools, with more than 16,000,000 students (the above figures do not include political schools and political training classes). In terms of public and private categories, public institutions account for 61 percent of institutions of higher learning, and private institutions account for 39 percent. Private schools also account for a considerable proportion of middle schools and primary schools. In areas where land reform has been completed and economic construction has been initially restored, our education has surpassed the old era in terms of quantitative development, and there have also been fundamental changes in the composition of students. At the end of 1949, the number of schools in Northeast China had increased by 60 percent compared to before liberation, and the five provinces in North China had increased by approximately 50 percent compared to the Kuomintang rule. In Northeast China and North China, the children of workers, farm laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, and urban poor have accounted for the majority of all children enrolled in schools.

(2) Health: According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Health (excluding Southwest and Inner Mongolia), there are 1,285 public medical institutions in the country, including general hospitals, health centers, health clinics, specialized hospitals, and other medical institutions, with approximately 30,000 beds and 28,000 staff members. Private hospitals and medical institutions have not yet been counted. There are approximately 18,000 formal physicians in the country. The number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners far exceeds that of Western medicine, but there are no statistics either.

(3) Science: The Chinese Academy of Sciences has taken over a total of 22 units belonging to the former Academia Sinica and the former Peiping Research Institute, some of which are of the same nature. After reorganization and consolidation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences now has 14 research institutes, one observatory, and one industrial laboratory. Outside of the Academy of Sciences, according to recent preliminary investigations, there are a total of 93 natural science research institutions in the country (including science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine). In addition, there are 17 science museums and 29 scientific instrument manufacturing plants in various places.

(4) Art: There are currently three public film studios in the country, in the Northeast, Beijing, and Shanghai, with film production accounting for two-thirds of the country's total. There are four important private film studios. There are a total of 467 movie theaters in the country, including 206 public, 10 public-private joint ventures, and 251 private. According to incomplete statistics, there are 161 other theaters in 18 major cities in Guannei and 82 in the provinces and cities of Northeast China. There are approximately 400 cultural troupes above the provincial, municipal, military, and division levels in the country, including approximately 40,000 drama, music, and dance workers.

(5) News: There are currently 624 newspapers in the country, including 165 daily newspapers. Among the daily newspapers, 122 are public and 43 are private. In addition, there are 216 military newspapers. According to incomplete statistics in May of this year, the total circulation of 153 daily newspapers in the country was more than 2,600,000 copies. Of the radio stations in the country, 51 are public and 32 are private (22 of which are in Shanghai). Public stations have an absolute advantage in terms of power. In terms of communications, the Xinhua News Agency has seven local general branches and 46 branches nationwide, including three overseas branches.

(6) Publishing: The state-owned Xinhua Bookstore currently has 887 branches and approximately 30 printing plants, with production capacity accounting for approximately one-quarter of the country's total publishing production capacity. According to a survey by the General Administration of Publications in 11 major cities, there are 244 private publishing houses and 6 public-private joint ventures. In the three months from January to the end of March of this year, public, private, and public-private joint publishing industries in the three regions of East China, Northeast China, and North China published a total of 878 new books and printed more than 52 million copies of first editions and reprints, of which the Xinhua Bookstore published more than 40 million copies.

Since its establishment, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, in addition to cooperating with all parties in carrying out the people's political learning movement mentioned in the first part of the report, the main tasks have been to take over and reorganize these cultural and educational institutions, and to focus on restoring, reforming, and developing them. I will now report to the conference on several important ones:

(1) Develop worker-peasant education. After the National Education Work Conference was held by the Central Ministry of Education last December, rapid worker-peasant middle schools were started. In the first half of 1950, 13 experimental rapid worker-peasant middle schools were established in Beijing and major administrative regions throughout the country. In addition to those established by government education departments, this type of school has also been established in many military units and government agencies. Starting in the second half of the year, more will be added in various regions. In addition, many spare-time cultural schools and technical schools have been established in various industrial areas. Recently, the Government Administration Council also issued "Instructions on Developing Spare-Time Education for Staff and Workers," deciding to establish staff and worker spare-time education committees across the country to lead this type of spare-time education. The main method of spare-time education for farmers is winter school. Many of these winter schools have been transformed into regular study schools or groups after the spring. In Northeast China, there are already 26,006 such civilian schools that have been transformed from winter schools into regular study schools.

(2) Reform higher education. Several major tasks have been carried out in this regard: First, the People's University of China was established, adopting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and combining it with the actual needs of our country to implement an educational method that combines teaching with practice, and cultivate construction work cadres for the country. The composition of students includes revolutionary cadres with considerable work experience, outstanding industrial workers, and young intellectuals. Second, in order to train teachers, Beijing Normal University was reformed in the first half of this year in accordance with the new education policy. Reforms of curriculum and teaching methods have also been carried out in other institutions of higher learning. Third, the National Higher Education Conference held this month further discussed and determined the direction and tasks of higher education in the future. The conference adopted draft documents such as the "Decision on Implementing Curriculum Reform in Institutions of Higher Learning," the "Decision on Leadership Relations in Institutions of Higher Learning," and the "Provisional Regulations for Institutions of Higher Learning," pointing out that higher education should cultivate high-level construction talents suitable for the needs of the country with a teaching method that combines theory and practice, and begin to open its doors to worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant youth.

(3) Develop epidemic prevention and health care work. The Central Ministry of Health has issued 395,196 dozen vaccinia vaccine in the first half of this year, which is estimated to be able to vaccinate at least 24 million people. According to incomplete statistics, more than 15,900,000 people have already been vaccinated. Vaccination is most common in places like Lushun and Dalian, accounting for 95 percent of the total population, so there has not been a single smallpox patient this year. In terms of plague prevention and control: The Central Ministry of Health eliminated the plague in Chabei last year, and established the Chabei-Inner Mongolia Plague Prevention and Control Institute this year, establishing epidemic prevention stations and quarantine stations in the area from Zhangjiakou to Guihua. After the plague occurred in the Leizhou Peninsula, the Central Ministry of Health immediately transferred 153 members of the Northeast Epidemic Prevention Team to assist in the elimination, so that our army liberating Hainan Island was spared from the plague. In other places, such as Fujian, Zhejiang, and Yunnan, staff members have been dispatched to assist in prevention and control or to supply plague vaccines. A total of more than 4 million doses of plague vaccine have been issued.

Disaster area epidemic prevention work was one of the central tasks in the first half of this year. The Central Ministry of Health organized a total of 400-member epidemic prevention team, which went to the major disaster areas of the Yellow River flooded area, northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, the plains area, and the Chaobai River construction area to carry out preventive injections and lice elimination baths. Farmers in Fengnan County, Hebei Province, wrote poems praising: "The government treats us well, and farmers take big baths. Clothes are steamed with steam, and lice can't bite. This is a big problem, and it is now solved."

In addition, it is expected that 480,000 people will be vaccinated with BCG this year, and vaccination is currently being promoted in more than a dozen cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Shanghai. This will play a big role in preventing childhood tuberculosis.

(4) Develop the film industry. In 1950, the Film Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture plans to produce 26 feature films, 17 documentaries, 48 newsreels, 1 art film, and translate 40 Soviet films. In addition to a portion that has been completed, most are currently in production. In addition, it helps and develops private film factories and establishes public-private joint film factories in order to increase the output of progressive films and gradually reduce the distribution of bad American and British films. In order to help the development of the private film industry, a method of issuing loans has also been implemented. In the first half of 1950, a total of approximately 6 billion yuan in Renminbi and 220,000 Hong Kong dollars were loaned out. According to statistics at the end of last year, due to the popularity of progressive films, the distribution volume of American and British films in North China has decreased from 63 in January to August to 12 in September to December. In order to establish the dominance of progressive films throughout the country, increasing the production of domestic progressive films and translated Soviet films, and improving the quality of domestic films to win more audiences is an important task in the film work.

Another major task of the film industry is to go deep into the troops, factories, and rural areas. We plan to expand the film projection teams from the existing 100 to 700. In addition to factories, troops, and government agencies, each province will have an average of 20 mobile film projection teams.

(5) Carry out the work of transforming old art. For the transformation of old art, we have adopted the method of closely cooperating with old artists and mobilizing them to jointly carry out reforms. The number of old artists in the country is quite large. According to incomplete materials, there are more than 6,000 in Beijing and Tianjin alone. This is an important force. The reform work adopts a prudent approach, first focusing on revising and reviewing old operas, and secondly on writing new scripts. Under the joint efforts of the government's opera improvement agencies and the leaders of the old art circles, preliminary results have been achieved. Hundreds of Peking operas, storytelling, Ping operas, etc. have been adapted and created in the Northeast and Beijing-Tianjin areas. A Peking Opera Research Institute, a Peking Opera Experimental School, and a Mass Theater have been established in Beijing. In the first half of this year, Beijing also held two old artist training classes, with more than 2,000 participants. Many famous artists have participated. Similar work has been done in other places. This reform movement has won the general support of old artists and has preliminarily changed the atmosphere of the old art circles.

(6) Improve newspaper work and strengthen broadcasting work. In April of this year, the General Administration of News convened a National News Work Conference and issued the "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work." This decision mainly pointed out that newspapers should closely contact the masses, carry out criticism and self-criticism, should cooperate with national construction and economic policies, and strengthen the propaganda and reporting of economic work. This decision quickly took effect in newspaper work in various places. Beijing People's Daily and several other major local newspapers now play a great guiding and critical role in the work of the people and government agencies, and have established a high reputation among readers.

In addition, in newspaper management work, the policy of enterpriseization has been implemented, the division of labor between public and private newspapers has been adjusted, and the system of newspapers being distributed through the post office has been implemented in many places, thereby improving the efficiency of distribution and saving distribution costs.

In terms of broadcasting: In the first half of 1950, an international broadcasting station and nine local people's broadcasting stations were established, six stations were taken over, and five stations are under construction. The National News Work Conference decided to establish a radio receiving network throughout the country, and various places have now begun to implement it.

(7) Adjust public and private publishing industries and establish a specialized distribution system. The General Administration of Publications is preparing to convene a National Publishing Work Conference this autumn to adjust the operations of existing public and private publishing industries, reasonably agree on their division of labor, and overcome the anarchic and unplanned state of publishing work today. In order to effectively promote the books and periodicals published by various public and private publishers throughout the country, reduce distribution costs and book prices, the General Administration of Publications is actively unifying the national Xinhua Bookstore to separate it from publishing tasks and make it a specialized agency responsible for distributing books and periodicals throughout the country. This plan is scheduled to be implemented in the second half of this year.

(8) Promote cultural exchange between all fraternal ethnic groups. For this purpose, we have established broadcasts in Tibetan and Uyghur languages, and are preparing broadcasts in Mongolian, published newspapers in Mongolian, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Korean languages, run Xinjiang College, Lanzhou Nationalities College, and other schools for minority ethnic groups, and dispatched film crews to Inner Mongolia and other places to shoot films depicting the lives of minority ethnic groups. Recently, the Cultural and Educational Committee and the Nationalities Affairs Commission are preparing to organize two central visiting groups to visit and investigate the minority ethnic groups in the Northwest and Southwest, respectively.

III. Several Issues in the Implementation of Cultural and Educational Policies

Accumulating eight months of experience, we have encountered several issues related to policy implementation in promoting cultural and educational work, which I would like to explain here.

First, we should take cautious steps when reforming cultural and educational undertakings. Our country has undergone earth-shaking changes, from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country to an independent, democratic, peaceful, and unified new democratic country. Since the nature of the country and society has changed, cultural education will inevitably undergo a fundamental change. Chapter 5 of the "Common Program" clearly stipulates the cultural and educational policies, especially Article 41, which stipulates: "The culture and education of the People's Republic of China shall be new democratic, that is, national, scientific, and mass culture and education. The main tasks of the cultural and educational work of the People's Government shall be to improve the cultural level of the people, cultivate talents for national construction, eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideology, and develop ideas of serving the people." This shows that the old cultural and educational undertakings in our country must undergo a reform process. Recently, Chairman Mao gave us another clear instruction:

"Reform the existing school education undertakings and the existing social and cultural undertakings step by step and cautiously, and strive to serve the people with all patriotic intellectuals. On this issue, the idea of ​​delaying time and unwilling to reform is wrong, and the idea of ​​being too impatient and attempting to reform by crude methods is also wrong."

We must sincerely follow these instructions and eliminate these two "wrong" deviations of thought, and carry out the reform work stipulated for us by the cultural and educational policies "step by step" and "cautiously." The reform of the old cultural and educational undertakings is indeed an arduous and long-term project, and we must unite all patriotic intellectuals who are willing to serve the people to work together to succeed.

Second, we should adhere to the principle of combining theory with practice and combining improvement with popularization in the construction of cultural and educational undertakings. Article 46 of the "Common Program" stipulates: "The educational method of the People's Republic of China shall be consistent with theory and practice." According to this principle, our higher education and secondary education, our scientific research work, should all serve the construction of our country's economy, politics, culture, and national defense according to actual needs. Ignoring this need, the tendency to pursue academics for the sake of academics is undoubtedly wrong and must be corrected. But on the other hand, we must also prevent the tendency to erase the importance of systematic theoretical research under the pretext of serving the practical, and to reduce educational work and scientific work to seeing the trees but not the forest, only caring about the needs of the moment and neglecting the long-term needs. At this National Higher Education Conference, we criticized these two incorrect tendencies and adhered to the principle of "consistency of theory and practice." We are prepared to do the same in other respects.

In our education work, cultural work, scientific work, health work, and publishing work, there is also the issue that popularization and improvement must be combined with each other. Whether it is for the study of theory or for serving the practical, there are two aspects of the wide needs of the vast majority of people and the specialized needs of a few guiding institutions. Improvement work is necessary, and we have always affirmed this point. Especially at present, when our country's construction work is becoming increasingly complex and specialized guidance is needed, we must especially affirm this point. However, many cultural and educational workers therefore despise popularization work, forget that our country is basically still an agricultural country, forget that 80% of our population is in the countryside, and are unwilling to go to the countryside to engage in various aspects of cultural and educational popularization work. This idea is of course not suitable for the current situation of the country. On the one hand, we should attach importance to improvement work and give improvement work possible and necessary conveniences, but on the other hand, we must strive to call on the broadest intellectuals to take on popularization work.

Third, we should implement the principle of overall consideration for both public and private cultural and educational undertakings. In order to unite all possible forces to develop our country's cultural and educational undertakings, we should resolutely implement the principle of taking into account both public and private interests as stipulated in the "Common Program." To implement public-private balance in cultural and educational undertakings, when supporting private cultural and educational undertakings, we should not only help them overcome economic difficulties, but more importantly, help them achieve ideological transformation and progress. Under the guidance of the government, the same type of cultural and educational undertakings should also have a certain division of labor and cooperation to benefit the needs of the people across the country.

There are many problems that we have encountered and may encounter in our work, but we have the basic conditions to solve the problems. As Chairman Mao said in his opening speech, "We have the great and correct Common Program as the criterion for checking work and discussing issues," so we will not be without basis and lose our way.

Financial economy is the material foundation of all national construction. We should especially thank the comrades working in finance and economy at this conference. They have made great achievements in a short period of time. The national finance has been unified, revenue and expenditure are close to balanced, malignant inflation has been curbed, and prices have gradually stabilized. This has not only laid a solid foundation for our cultural and educational work, but also provided us cultural and educational workers with an excellent model.

In his report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on June 6, Chairman Mao called on the people of the whole country to further "strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation." Chairman Mao said:

"To achieve a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, three conditions are required, namely: (1) the completion of land reform; (2) the rational adjustment of existing industry and commerce; and (3) a large reduction in the expenses required by state institutions. ... These conditions are entirely certain to be achieved in about three years.

At that time, we will be able to see a fundamental improvement in the entire financial and economic situation of our country."

This is another scientific prediction. We cultural and educational workers should, at present, work together to strive for the realization of these three conditions. In another three years or so, we can boldly believe that the entire cultural and educational situation of our country will also improve fundamentally with the fundamental improvement of the financial and economic situation.

Indeed, "No difficulties can stop the advancement of the people's cause."

　　关于文化教育工作的报告
    （一九五零年六月十七日在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上的报告）
    郭沫若主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我代表中央人民政府政务院文教委员会，向中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议作关于全国文教工作的报告。
    我的报告准备说三个问题：第一、全国人民政治学习运动的概况；第二、全国文教建设工作的概况；第三、在执行文化教育政策上的几个问题。
    一、全国人民的政治学习运动的概况
    我想先说明一下目前中国人民的政治学习运动。
    中央人民政府成立后，全国各地展开了大规模的学习运动。这个学习运动是解放了的人民用民主的方法教育自己改造自己的运动，也是我们进行一般文化教育工作的政治基础。这个运动的发展及其成就，是值得特别重视的。毛主席在《论人民民主专政》中说：“有了人民的国家，人民才有可能在全国范围内和全体规模上用民主的方法教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响（这个影响现在还是很大，并将在长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭），改造自己从旧社会得来的旧习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派所指示的错误路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义与共产主义发展。”当前这个规模宏大的学习运动，它的内容就是这样。
    这个学习运动的收获，概略说来，表现在下列几点：
    第一、通过对于政协三大文献，特别是“共同纲领”的学习，广大人民明确地认识了新中国与旧中国根本的区别。全国人民，特别是工人和农民，都增强了自己的新中国主人翁的感觉。新中国各民族的团结，也大大地增强了。很多的旧知识分子和公教人员，对过去的错误思想作了自我批评。所谓“中间路线”的错误思想的影响，基本上是廓清了。
    第二、广大人民对于世界两大阵营——以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营和以美国帝国主义为首的帝国主义侵略阵营——的认识，也有了大的进步。广大人民经过了中华人民共和国成立以来的外交斗争的教育，包括对白皮书的批评运动和对中苏友好同盟互助条约的学习运动，认识了美国帝国主义的侵略面目和扩张野心；认识了美国帝国主义及其走狗，是中国人民的死敌；认识了正是美国帝国主义，处心积虑企图挑起新的世界战争。苏联对中国人民的伟大友谊，也有力地驳斥了中外反动派的无耻谰言。代替过去帝国主义与国民党反动派所长期传播的对苏联的怀疑和误解，广大人民认识了苏联是中国人民最亲密的朋友；认识了苏联是世界和平的支柱；认识了中苏新约的订立不仅有利于中苏两大国家，而且大大地有利于世界和平的保卫。在世界两大阵营中，没有中间的道路，中国必须站在社会主义苏联的一边。世界和平民主阵营的力量，已经超过帝国主义侵略阵营的力量，这个事实，大大提高了我国人民在反对帝国主义斗争中的胜利信心。保卫世界和平运动已在全国日益展开，在全世界保卫和平大会的宣言上签名的人数截至目前止已达一千万人以上。
    第三、在广大的劳动人民和知识分子中，劳动创造文明的观点，基本上树立起来了。劳动成为光荣的事情。劳动人民开始普遍受人尊敬。许多工厂和矿山中，工人展开了生产竞赛和新纪录运动。
    第四、为人民服务的观点，在知识分子和政府工作人员中广泛地流行了。经过学习之后，广大的知识分子和青年学生，参加了革命工作和建设工作。他们大多数都很努力，在工作中表现了积极性，著有成绩。
    这样，由于广大人们的思想觉醒，就进一步巩固了我们的人民民主专政，推进了国家建设事业，扩大了保卫世界和平的力量。
    这是思想战线上的伟大胜利。
    这个胜利，不用说是整个革命胜利在意识上的反映，是由于毛主席的正确领导，由于中央人民政府的正确领导，由于各方面工作人员的努力和推动所得来的。
    这个全国规模的学习运动主要地是经过了以下的几种方法：
    第一、是各地的政治大学和政治训练班的设立。据不完全的统计，已经参加了这些学校和训练班的人数在四十七万人以上。这些参加学习的人们，就其社会成份来说，包括大中学生、职业青年、工人、农民、旧公教人员、自由职业者、家庭妇女、商人等等，其中最多的是知识分子和青年学生。就其政治成份来说，包括共产党、各民主党派、无党无派直到过去参加过反动党团的分子。
    第二、是组织了一般大中学生与教师的思想学习。各地解放以后，大中学校普遍设立了政治课，教授社会发展史、政治经济学、新民主主义论等课程。在教师中，也普遍地组织了学习。经过学习之后，全国已有百分之二十的大中学生参加了新民主主义青年团。
    第三、是组织工人农民和市民的学习。各地解放之初，工会和公营企业组织，首先开展了一个热烈的政治学习运动。在工人的政治认识提高以后，他们就普遍要求进一步提高文化、技术和政治知识，于是各地先后创办了工人夜校和业余文化学校。据不完全统计，目前参加这类文化技术学习的工人有五十余万人。农民学习的一个重要方式是冬学，去冬今春参加冬学的人数有一千万人。在市民方面，业余补习学校起了很大的作用。据去年年底的统计，这种学校全国约有一万四千所，学生近七十万人。
    此外，政府文教部门还组织了文学艺术的宣传、新闻广播的教育、科学资料和文物的展览、学习书刊的大量出版发行等等，来推进这个学习运动。据华北、华东、东北各书店的统计，今年一月到三月，共印行了革命理论及政策文件的书籍一百零一万三千五百册。中央人民广播电台最近举办的社会科学讲座，在两个月中就联系了有组织的基本听众二百零六个单位，遍及二十个省。话剧“红旗歌”，在上海连演一百数十场，打破中国话剧历来上演的纪录。这几个例子，也反映了人民学习运动的广泛性。
    解放了的人民在自我教育和自我改造上，虽然已经显示出了这样巨大的成绩，但我们要看到，运动的发展还仅在初步的阶段。我们必须加强工作的计划性来适应这一运动的更进一步的展开，并巩固我们的已有的成绩。无可讳言，我们的工作中还存在着不少缺点。特别是对于根本大法“共同纲领”的执行，我们虽然做了不少一般的宣传，但是比较空泛，而缺少切合具体需要的深入的掌握。这些缺点应当在今后的工作中注意克服。
    二、全国文教建设工作的概况
    现在我来说一说全国文化教育建设的工作概况。我们从旧中国所接受下来的文教事业的遗产，是很贫弱的，数量上很不够，内容很多也与人民的要求不能适应。老解放区过去做了一部分很好的文化教育的工作，但是这些工作的数量更小。为了便于大家了解情况起见，我这里把教育、卫生、科学、艺术、新闻、出版六个方面的几个主要数字介绍一下：
    （一）教育方面：根据现有不完全材料，全国高等学校有二二七所，学生十三万四千余人；中等学校三六九○所，学生一百零九万余人；初等学校二一二、八九○所，学生一千六百余万人（上述数字，不包括政治学校和政治训练班在内）。就公私立的类别来说，在高等学校中，公立的占百分之六一；私人创办的占百分之三九；在中学和小学中，私立学校亦占相当大的比例。在土地改革已经完成，经济建设已经初步恢复的地区，我们的教育事业，在量的发展上已超过旧时代，并且在学生成份上也起了根本的变化。东北的学校数在一九四九年底比解放前已经增加了百分之六十，华北五省比国民党统治时期增加了约百分之五十。在东北和华北，工人、雇农、贫农、中农及城市贫民的子女，在全体入学儿童中已占大多数。
    （二）卫生方面：根据卫生部不完全的统计（西南内蒙不在内），全国的公立医疗机构，包括普通医院、卫生院、卫生所、专科医院及其他医疗机构，共一二八五个单位，其病床数约为三万个，工作人员二万八千人。私立医院和医疗机构尚未统计。全国正式医师约为一万八千人，中医人数则远超于西医，但也无统计。
    （三）科学方面：中国科学院接收了前中央研究院、前北平研究院所属各研究所共二十二个单位，这些单位有些是性质相同的。经过改组和整理后，现在中国科学院有十四个研究所、一个天文台、一个工业实验馆。在科学院之外，据最近初步调查，全国自然科学的研究机构（包括理工农医）共计九十三个单位。此外，各地有科学馆十七处，科学仪器制造厂二十九家。
    （四）艺术方面：全国现有东北、北京、上海三个公营电影制片厂，电影片生产力占全国的三分之二。重要的私营电影厂有四家。全国的电影院共四六七所，其中公营的二○六所，公私合营的一○所，私营的二五一所。其他剧院，据不完全的统计，关内十八个主要城市中有一六一所，东北各省市有八十二所。全国省、市、军、师级以上的文工团约四百个，包括四万左右个戏剧、音乐、舞蹈工作者。
    （五）新闻方面：全国现有报纸共六二四种，其中日报一六五种，日报中公营的一二二种，私营的四十三种；此外部队报纸二一六种。据今年五月份不完全统计，全国一五三种日报的总发行数为二百六十余万份。全国的广播台，公营的五一台，私营的三二台（其中二十二台在上海），在电力上公营台是占绝对优势。通讯事业方面，新华社全国的地方总分社七个，分社四十六个，其中海外分社三个。
    （六）出版方面：国营的新华书店现有分支店八八七所，印厂约三十所，生产力量约占全国出版总生产力四分之一。据出版总署十一个主要城市的调查，私营出版业为二四四家，公私合营的六家。本年一月至三月底三个月中间，华东、东北及华北三个地区公营、私营及公私合营出版业共出版新书八七八种，印行了初版、重版书五千二百余万册，其中新华书店出版为四千余万册。
    政务院文化教育委员会成立以来，除了配合各方，进行了报告第一部分所说的人民政治学习运动以外，主要的任务就是接收整理这些文教机构，并有重点地进行了恢复、改革和发展的工作。现就其中几件重要的向大会报告：
    （一）开展工农教育。去年十二月，中央教育部召开了全国教育工作会议以后，开始举办工农速成中学。一九五零年上半年，在北京和全国各大行政区已创办了十三所实验性的工农速成中学。除了由政府教育部门设立的以外，在好些部队、机关中也设立了这种学校。下半年起，在各地区还要增设。此外在各工业区域创办了许多业余的文化学校和技术学校。最近政务院并发布了“关于开展职工业余教育的指示”，决定在全国各地建立职工业余教育委员会，来领导这种业余教育。农民的业余教育工作，主要是采取冬学的方式。许多这些冬学在开春后，转变为常年学习的学校或小组。在东北，这种由冬学变为常年学习的民校，已经有二万六千零六处。
    （二）改革高等教育。在这方面进行了几件主要工作：第一，创办了中国人民大学，采取苏联的先进经验，结合我国的实际需要，实施教学与实际联系的教育方法，为国家培养建设工作干部。学生的成份是有相当工作经历的革命干部，优秀的产业工人，和青年知识分子。第二，为了培养师资，在今年上半年，按照新的教育方针，改革了北京师范大学；在其他高等学校中，也都进行了课程与教育方法的改革。第三，本月份所召开的全国高等教育会议，进一步讨论和确定了今后高等教育的方针与任务，在会议中通过了“关于实施高等学校课程改革的决定”、“关于高等学校领导关系的决定”和“高等学校暂行规程”等文件草案，指出高等教育应以理论与实际一致的教学方法，培养适合国家需要的高级建设人才，并开始向工农干部与工农青年开门。
    （三）开展防疫保健工作。中央卫生部在今年上半年已发出牛痘苗三十九万五千一百九十六打，估计至少可接种二千四百万人，据不完全的统计，已经接种的有一千五百九十余万人。接种最普遍的如旅大，占全人口百分之九十五，因此今年就没有一个天花病人。在鼠疫防治方面：中央卫生部去年扑灭了察北鼠疫，今年建立了察蒙鼠疫防治所，在张家口到归绥一带都设立了防疫站和检疫站。雷州半岛的鼠疫发生后，中央卫生部即调东北防疫队一五三人前往协助扑灭，使我解放海南岛的军队免于鼠疫的侵害。其他如对福建、浙江、云南等地的鼠疫，都曾派员协助防治或供给鼠疫菌苗。计已发出的鼠疫菌苗，共四百余万人份。
    灾区防疫工作，是今年上半年中心工作之一。中央卫生部前后组织了四百名的防疫总队，分赴黄泛区、皖北、苏北、平原等各重灾区与潮白河施工区，进行预防注射及灭虱淋浴等工作。河北丰南县农民写诗赞扬道：“政府优待好，农民大洗澡。衣服用汽蒸，虱子不能咬。此乃大问题，现在解决了。”
    此外，预计今年要接种卡介苗四十八万人，目前正在北京、天津、南京、上海等十几个城市推广接种。这对于儿童结核病的预防，将起很大的作用。
    （四）发展电影事业。一九五零年中央文化部的电影局计划拍制故事片二十六部，记录片十七部，新闻简报四十八号，美术片一部，翻译苏联片四十部。除已完成一部分外，大部分正在摄制中。此外并帮助和发展私营影片厂及设立公私合营的影片厂，以期增加进步影片的产量，逐渐减少恶劣的美英影片的发行量。为了帮助私营电影业的发展，并且实施了发行贷款的办法。一九五零年上半年计共贷出人民币约六十亿元和港币二十二万元。据去年年底的统计，由于进步电影片受到了观众的欢迎，华北区美英片的发行量已由一至八月的六十三部减至九至十二月的十二部。为了在全国建立进步电影的优势，增加国产进步片与翻译苏联片的产量，提高国产片的质量，以争取更多的观众，是电影工作中的一个重要任务。
    电影事业的另一重大工作就是深入部队、工厂、农村中去。我们计划扩大电影放映队，从已有的一百队增加到七百队，除工厂部队机关外，使每一省平均有二十个巡回的电影放映队。
    （五）进行改造旧艺术的工作。对于旧艺术的改造，我们是采取了与旧艺人紧密合作，发动他们共同来进行改革的办法。全国旧艺人的数目是相当大的，据不完全的材料，仅京津二地即有六千余人。这是一支重要的力量。改革工作采取稳重的方针，首先着重于修改和审查旧的戏曲，其次才是编写新的剧本。在政府戏曲改进机构与旧艺术界的领导者协力进行之下，已经得到初步的收获。在东北和京津已经改编和创作的京剧、书曲、评戏等数百种。在北京建立了一个京剧研究院、一个京剧实验学校和一个大众剧场。今年上半年，北京还办了两期旧艺人训练班，参加者达二千余人，许多著名的艺人都参加了。其他各地也都作了类似的工作。这个改革运动已经获得了旧艺人普遍的拥护，初步地转变了旧艺术界的风气。
    （六）改进报纸工作和加强广播工作。今年四月新闻总署召集一次全国新闻工作会议，发布了“改进报纸工作的决定”。这个决定主要指出报纸应该密切联系群众，展开批评与自我批评，应该配合国家建设与经济政策，加强经济工作的宣传与报导。这个决定很快在各地报纸工作上发生了效力。北京人民日报和其他几个主要地方报纸，现在对人民和政府机关的工作起了很大的指导和批评作用，在读者中间建立了很高的威信。
    此外在报纸管理工作上，实行了企业化的方针，调整了公私营报纸的分工，在许多地方实施了报纸经由邮局发行的制度，因而提高了发行的效力，节省了发行的费用。
    广播方面：一九五零年上半年建立了一个国际广播台，九个地方人民广播台，接管了六个台，在筹建中的还有五个台。全国新闻工作会议决定在全国建立广播收音网，现在各地已开始执行。
    （七）调整公私出版业，建立专门的发行系统。出版总署准备在今年秋季召集全国出版工作会议，调整现有公私出版业的经营，合理商定它们的分工，克服现在出版工作中的无政府无计划状态。为了有效地在全国推销各公私出版家所出版的书刊，减低发行费用和书价，出版总署正在积极统一全国的新华书店，使它脱离出版任务，成为普及全国的专门负责发行书刊的机关。这项计划，准备在今年下半年实现。
    （八）促进各兄弟民族之间的文化交流。为此目的，我们已经建立了藏语和维吾尔语的广播，并正在筹备蒙语的广播，出版了蒙文、维吾尔文、哈萨克文、朝鲜文的报纸，办理了新疆学院，兰州民族学院和其他为少数民族办理的学校，并派遣了摄影队赴内蒙古等地拍摄表现少数民族生活的电影。最近文教委员会和民族事务委员会，正在筹备组织两个中央访问团，分别到西北与西南的少数民族中去进行访问与考察。
    三、在执行文化教育政策上的几个问题
    积累了八个月的经验，我们在推进文化教育工作中遇到有几个和政策执行有关的问题，我想在这儿申说一下。
    第一、是我们在进行文教事业的改革时应采取谨慎步骤。我们的国家，经过了翻天覆地的改变，由半殖民地半封建的国家，变成了独立、民主、和平、统一的新民主主义的国家。国家和社会的性质既已改变，文化教育也就不可避免地要发生一种根本性质的改变。《共同纲领》第五章文教政策规定得很明白，特别是第四十一条规定：“中华人民共和国的文化教育为新民主主义的，即民族的、科学的、大众的文化教育。人民政府的文化教育工作，应以提高人民文化水平，培养国家建设人才，肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想为主要任务。”这就表明着我国旧有的文化教育事业，必须经过一个改革过程。最近毛主席又给予了我们一个明确的指示：
    “有步骤地谨慎地进行旧有学校教育事业和旧有社会文化事业的改革工作，争取一切爱国的知识分子为人民服务。在这个问题上，拖延时间不愿改革的思想是不对的，过于性急，企图用粗暴方法进行改革的思想也是不对的。”
    我们要诚心诚意地照着这指示做去，摒除这两种“不对的”偏差思想，“有步骤地”而又“谨慎地”进行文教政策所为我们规定着的改革工作。旧有的文化教育事业的改革，的确是一项艰巨的长期的工程，必须团结一切愿意为人民服务的爱国的知识分子来共同努力，才能成功。
    第二、是我们在文教事业建设中应坚持理论与实际相结合，提高与普及相结合的方针。“共同纲领”第四十六条规定：“中华人民共和国的教育方法为理论与实际一致。”根据这个原则，我们的高等教育和中等教育，我们的科学研究工作，都应当按照实际需要，为我国经济、政治、文化、国防的建设服务。忽视这种需要的为学术而学术的倾向，无疑是错误的，必须纠正的。但在另一方面，那种借口为实际服务，而抹杀有系统的理论研究的重要性，把教育工作和科学工作降低为只见树木不见森林、只顾此时此地需要不顾长远需要的倾向，我们也要防止。在这次全国高等教育会议上，我们便批判了这两种不正确的倾向，坚持了“理论与实际一致”的方针。在其它方面，我们也准备这样做。
    在我们的教育工作、文化工作、科学工作、卫生工作、出版工作中，又都存在着普及和提高必须互相结合的问题。无论是为了研究理论或是为了服务实际，都有最大多数人的广泛需要和少数指导机构的专门需要的两个方面。提高的工作是必要的，我们向来是肯定这一点的，目前当我们国家建设工作日益繁复，日益需要专门指导的时候，尤其要肯定这一点。但是有许多文教工作者却因此而轻视普及工作，忘记了我们的国家基本上还是一个农业国家，忘记了我们百分之八十的人口都在农村，不愿意到农村去从事各方面的文教普及工作，这种想法当然也是不适合于国家当前的情况的。我们应当一方面重视提高工作，给提高工作以可能的和必要的便利条件，而另一方面却必须努力号召最广大的知识分子担任普及工作。
    第三、是我们对公营与私营文教事业应实行统筹兼顾的原则。为了团结一切可能的力量来发展我国文教事业，我们应该坚决执行“共同纲领”所规定的公私兼顾的原则。在文教事业上要实行公私兼顾，扶助私营文教事业时，不仅要帮助它克服经济上的困难，更重要的还要帮助它获得思想上的改造和进步。同一类的文教事业，在政府指导之下，还要使它们有一定的分工合作，以利于全国人民的需要。
    在工作中我们所已经遭遇到和可能遭遇到的问题是不少的，然而解决问题的基本条件我们是具备着了。正如毛主席在开会辞中所说：“我们有伟大而正确的共同纲领以为检查工作讨论问题的准则”，因此我们不至于无所依据和迷失方向。
    财政经济是一切国家建设的物质基础。我们在本次会议上应当特别感谢财经方面的工作同志们，他们在短期间内有了很大的成就。全国的财政统一了，收支接近平衡了，恶性的通货膨胀制止了，物价逐渐稳定了。这不仅为我们文教工作打好了坚定的基础，而且为我们文教工作者提供了优良的模范。
    毛主席六月六日在中国共产党第七届第三次中央全体会议的报告上，号召全国人民更进一步地“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”。毛主席说：
    “要获得财政经济情况的基本好转，需要三个条件，即：（一）土地改革的完成；（二）现有工商业的合理调整；（三）国家机构所需经费的大量节减。……这些条件是完全有把握地能够在三年左右争取其实现的。
    到了那时，我们就可以看见我们国家整个财政经济状况的根本好转了。”
    这是又一次的科学性的预言，我们文教工作者在目前自当共同努力来争取这三个条件的实现。再隔三年左右，我们可以大胆相信：我们国家整个文化教育状况也会随着财政经济状况的根本好转而好转了。
    的确的，“任何困难都不能阻止人民事业的前进”。
