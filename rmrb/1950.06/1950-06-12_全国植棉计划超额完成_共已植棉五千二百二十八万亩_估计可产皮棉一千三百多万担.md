Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The national cotton planting plan of 50 million mu has been exceeded this year. According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government at the beginning of this month, the Northeast region has planted 4.05 million mu of cotton this spring, the North China region has planted 20.22 million mu, the East China region has planted 13.13 million mu, the Central South region has planted 11.08 million mu, and the Northwest region has planted 3.8 million mu. The total area planted with cotton nationwide (excluding the Southwest region) has reached 52.28 million mu (the original plan for this year was 50 million mu), an increase of more than 13 million mu compared to 1949. If there are no irresistible disasters, it is estimated that this year's output of ginned cotton will be more than 13 million dan, which, in addition to being used for wadding, can roughly meet the needs of the national textile industry.

The over-fulfillment of this year's cotton planting plan is inseparable from the active leadership of local people's governments. At the beginning of the planting season, local people's governments first thoroughly publicized reasonable grain-cotton price ratios, eliminating farmers' concerns about losing out by planting cotton. At the same time, some special districts and county people's governments in the Northeast region and Shandong and Hebei provinces further provided practical guarantees to cotton farmers by pre-signing cotton purchase contracts with farmers through supply and marketing cooperatives. A new rural proverb recently popular in Shanxi, "Sign a contract in the spring and harvest cotton in the autumn; see if I plant cotton or not!" fully expresses the farmers' enthusiasm for cotton planting after signing purchase contracts. In addition, in terms of cotton seed supply, in addition to conducting local adjustments, the leading organs of major administrative regions and provinces also adjusted a total of more than 74 million jin of cotton seeds on a larger scale nationwide, enabling all cotton-growing areas to complete sowing in a timely manner.

The nationwide over-fulfillment of the cotton sowing plan is only the beginning of this year's cotton production increase. Currently, cotton farmers in various regions are actively carrying out weeding, seedling protection, and pest and disease control under the leadership of the people's governments. After correcting the idea of some cadres that "once cotton seeds are sown, everything will be fine," local people's governments are actively leading farmers to prepare insecticides such as tobacco, lime, and derris root powder to prevent pests, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on preventing cotton aphids. The people's governments of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other places have led cotton farmers to promptly replant any missing seedlings in cotton fields with uneven emergence in their respective areas.

### 全国植棉计划超额完成  共已植棉五千二百二十八万亩  估计可产皮棉一千三百多万担

　　全国植棉计划超额完成
    共已植棉五千二百二十八万亩  估计可产皮棉一千三百多万担
    【新华社十一日讯】今年全国植棉五千万亩的计划已超额完成。据中央人民政府农业部本月初的初步统计，今春东北区已植棉四百零五万亩，华北区植棉二千零二十二万亩，华东区植棉一千三百一十三万亩，中南区植棉一千一百零八万亩，西北区植棉三百八十万亩。全国（西南区未统计在内）共已植棉五千二百二十八万亩（原计划今年植棉五千万亩），比一九四九年增植一千三百余万亩。如无不可抗拒的灾害，估计今年可产皮棉一千三百余万担，除供胎絮之用外，可大致满足全国纺织工业的需要。
    今年植棉计划超额完成，是与各地人民政府的积极领导分不开的。在植棉开始时，各地人民政府首先深入地宣传了合理的粮棉比价政策，消除了农民怕种棉吃亏的顾虑；同时，东北区及山东、河北等省的某些专署、县人民政府，更通过了供销社与农民预先订定购棉合同，进一步给棉农提出了切实的保证。山西农村最近流行着一句“春订合同秋收花，看我种花不种花”的新农谚，充分表露出农民在订立购棉合同后的植棉热情。此外，在棉种的供应上，各大行政区和各省的领导机关除进行就地调剂外，并在全国较大范围内共调剂了棉种七千四百余万斤，使各植棉区均能适时完成播种。
    全国超额完成棉花播种计划，仅是今年棉花增产的开端，现各地棉农正在人民政府领导下积极进行锄苗保苗和防治病虫灾害等工作。各地人民政府在纠正某些干部“棉种下地，百事大吉”的思想后，正根据中央人民政府农业部防治棉蚜的指示，积极领导农民准备烟草、石灰、鲁藤粉等杀虫药品，以防治虫害。陕西、山西、湖南、湖北等地人民政府，已领导棉农将各该地出苗不齐的棉田缺苗，及时补种完毕。
