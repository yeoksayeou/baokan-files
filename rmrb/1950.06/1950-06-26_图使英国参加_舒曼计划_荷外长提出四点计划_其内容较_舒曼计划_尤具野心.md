Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker presented a so-called four-point plan to Western European countries on June 13th, aiming to internationalize all Western European industries. According to a United Press report, Stikker's plan "aims to accelerate the European economic union of the Marshall Plan," and its content is even more ambitious than the "Schuman Plan." The plan proposes: 1. Reorganize all Western European industries, enabling them to "divide labor" and "specialize," thereby completely destroying the economic independence of Western European countries. 2. Each country should raise a so-called "Western European Integration Fund" for the purpose of reorganizing Western European industries in this way. 3. Abolish existing tariff barriers in Western European countries. 4. Unify the economic budgets of Western European countries.

　　This plan is actually a means of pressuring Britain to participate in the "Schuman Plan." Stikker himself said: In order to achieve the integration of the European economy, Britain's participation is urgently needed. "We will do everything possible to persuade Britain to join the Schuman Plan and our plan."

　　Therefore, the "Stikker Plan" has been enthusiastically praised by American newspapers. The New York Times, after praising the plan as a "welcome European self-help measure," threatened Britain, saying: "European integration is moving forward, and those who obstruct its path are becoming the reactionaries of today."

　　However, Stikker's proposal did not have much effect in Britain. The London Times coldly stated: Although all countries hope for a "closer European economic union, the divisions caused by practical problems seem to be more numerous than cooperation." The newspaper also pointed out that this plan would cause a serious commercial crisis, and even eliminate the entire industry of certain regions. Therefore, this plan is "worthy of study."

　　图使英国参加“舒曼计划”
    荷外长提出四点计划
    其内容较“舒曼计划”尤具野心
    【新华社二十五日讯】荷兰外长斯蒂克于六月十三日向西欧各国提出了使全部西欧工业国际化的所谓四点计划。据合众社报道：斯蒂克的计划“旨在加速马歇尔计划的欧洲经济联盟”，其内容较“舒曼计划”尤具野心。这一计划主张：一、改组全部西欧各国工业，使之“分工”和“专门化”，从而全部摧毁西欧各国在经济上的独立性。二、由各国筹集一笔所谓“西欧整体化基金”，以为这样改组西欧工业之用。三、废除西欧各国现存的关税壁垒。四、统一西欧各国经济预算。
    这一计划实际上乃是压迫英国参加“舒曼计划”的一个手段。斯蒂克自己曾说：为了要达成欧洲经济的整体化，英国的参与至为迫切需要。“我们将尽一切力量说服英国让它参加舒曼计划和我们的计划”。
    因此，“斯蒂克计划”受到了美国报纸热烈的赞美，纽约时报在赞扬这一计划为“值得欢迎的欧洲自助措施”后，向英国威胁说：“欧洲整体化在前进中，那些阻拦它的道路的人都在变成当今的反动派了”。
    但是斯蒂克的建议并没有在英国引起多大的效果。伦敦泰晤士报冷淡地表示：虽然各国都希望有一个“更紧密的欧洲经济联盟，但是实际的问题所引起的隔膜，似乎比合作多些”。该报并指出这个计划将引起商业的严重危机，甚至并将消灭某些地区的全部工业，因此这个计划“值得研究”。
