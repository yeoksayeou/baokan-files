Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 26th: The Korean Workers' Party organ "Workers' Daily" published an editorial on the 26th, calling on officers and soldiers of the South Korean puppet "National Defense Forces" to turn their guns against the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. The editorial stated: The Syngman Rhee bandit gang has undermined all efforts by the entire Korean people to achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and attempted to turn Korea into a colony of American imperialism, thus launching a fratricidal civil war. However, all the fruits of freedom and happiness that the Korean people have obtained must not be taken away by American imperialism. The editorial continued: The people of the whole country are very clear that the Syngman Rhee bandit gang is a running dog of American imperialism and a national traitor who sells out the fatherland. They have neither fatherland nor nation. The editorial awakened the puppet "National Defense Forces" officers and soldiers, saying: "Your enemy is not North Korea, but the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, the loyal dog of the United States, who drinks your blood and seizes your land and factories. Therefore, for the sake of the fatherland and the nation, for your own sake, turn your guns around! Capture the Syngman Rhee bandit gang alive, and our country can be unified and independent, and our nation can be liberated." The editorial concluded: "The Korean people, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, will surely be victorious!"

    号召伪军掉转枪口  反对卖国贼李承晚
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】朝鲜劳动党机关报《劳动新闻》二十六日发表社论，号召南朝鲜伪“国防军”官兵掉转枪口，反对李承晚匪帮。社论称：李承晚匪帮破坏全朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的一切努力，妄图将朝鲜变成美帝国主义的殖民地，因此发动了同族相争的内战。但是朝鲜人民所获得的一切自由幸福的果实，是决不能让美帝国主义抢夺去的。社论继称：全国人民都很清楚，李承晚匪帮是美帝国主义的走狗，是出卖祖国的民族叛徒。他们是既无祖国，也无民族的。社论唤醒伪“国防军”官兵说：“你们的敌人不是北朝鲜，而是喝你们的血抢夺了你们土地和工厂的美国忠犬李承晚匪帮。因此你们为了祖国和民族，为了自己，掉转你们的枪口吧！活捉了李承晚匪帮，我们国家就能统一独立，我们民族即可获得自由解放”。社论结语称：“朝鲜人民在金日成将军的领导下，一定要胜利！”
