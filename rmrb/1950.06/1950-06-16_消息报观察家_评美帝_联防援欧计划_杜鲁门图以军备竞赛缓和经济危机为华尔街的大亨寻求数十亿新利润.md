    Comments on US Imperialism's "Joint Defense Aid to Europe Plan"
     Truman Seeks Billions in New Profits for Wall Street Tycoons by Using the Arms Race to Alleviate the Economic Crisis
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 11th] TASS, Moscow, June 11th: An observer of Izvestia commented on Truman's request to Congress for an appropriation of $1.2225 billion for the so-called "Joint Defense Assistance Program" for the next fiscal year, stating that military "aid" programs, like the Marshall Plan, are intended to intensify the arms race in preparation for war. This kind of arms race guarantees Wall Street tycoons billions of dollars in new profits. Truman's message implies that the arms race can alleviate the economic crisis. Truman pointed out that the plan will allow specialized enterprises to be further utilized—that is, to increase the production of war industries, and may have a favorable impact on the labor situation. The observer continued: The American rulers, in order to implement Wall Street's order to intensify the "Cold War" and accelerate the arms race, are trying to find arguments for their aggressive line. The American President openly declared his anti-Soviet policy in his message.

    The area of implementation of the military "aid" program proposed by Truman truly includes the entire capitalist world. Among them, the support for the criminal Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and its sabotage activities against the People's Republic of China occupies a special place. Truman blatantly stated that the Kuomintang bandits received American weapons and were trained by American instructors. This explains why the American government stubbornly opposes recognizing the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

    评美帝“联防援欧计划”           
     杜鲁门图以军备竞赛缓和经济危机为华尔街的大亨寻求数十亿新利润
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：消息报观察家评杜鲁门要求国会拨款十二亿二千二百五十万美元，作为下一年度的所谓“联防援助计划”费用称：军事“援助”计划与马歇尔计划一样，都是要加紧军备竞赛以准备战争。这种军备竞赛保证华尔街的大亨得到数十亿元的新利润。杜鲁门的咨文暗示军备竞赛能缓和经济危机。杜鲁门指出：该计划将使得专门企业能被进一步利用——也就是使战争工业增产，并可能对劳动力情况发生有利的影响。观察家继称：美国统治者为了执行华尔街的加紧“冷战”，并加速军备竞赛的命令，正企图为他们的侵略路线寻找论据。美国总统在咨文中公开地宣布了他敌视苏联的方针。
    杜鲁门提出的军事“援助”计划的实施区域，名符其实地包括整个资本主义世界。其中对支持罪犯蒋介石匪帮及其反对中华人民共和国的破坏活动一事，占有特别地位。杜鲁门露骨地表示，国民党匪徒得到美国的武器，由美国教官施以训练。美国政府为什么顽固地反对承认中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利，从这里可以找到解释。
