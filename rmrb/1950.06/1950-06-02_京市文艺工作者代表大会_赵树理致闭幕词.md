Beijing Municipal Literary and Art Workers Representative Assembly
Zhao Shuli's Closing Address

[Beijing Municipal News Agency News] The Beijing Municipal Literary and Art Workers Representative Assembly concluded with a closing address by Zhao Shuli. The full text is as follows:

This four-day conference has successfully concluded. In these four days, we have had three major gains:

First, after listening to the speeches of the leading comrades and the reports of this assembly, and after brief discussions, we have achieved a unified direction—that is to say, we have clarified how large our team is, who our main service objects are, and how this "service" should be rendered. If we use opera as an analogy, it means we have clarified how large our troupe is, what kind of audience is in the seats, and therefore decided what programs should be performed in this show and how to perform them well.

Second, the establishment of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles will make it easier for workers in various departments to achieve organic connections in the future, to have a place to discuss problems, and to connect with the masses. In the past, our work was certainly not without connections, but there were still some phenomena of working in isolation. For example, some work departments were troubled by not being able to get expert guidance, and at the same time, were there some experts who felt they had no place to use their talents? Now that we have such a group organization, it will be easier for our ten thousand eight generals to cooperate better with each other.

Third, many important issues were raised: Because everyone has a job position, our meeting had to end in these short few days, so it was not possible to solve all the problems. However, the representatives put forward more than seventy proposals (not items), raising the more important issues. These problems cannot be solved all at once, but they can be solved gradually. If there had not been this meeting to discover these many problems at once, who knows how much time it would have taken to grind them out. This is also a major gain of this assembly. Of course, there are other gains, but the above three points are the greatest victories of this assembly, and our meeting will close in this victory.

### 京市文艺工作者代表大会  赵树理致闭幕词

　　京市文艺工作者代表大会
    赵树理致闭幕词
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市文艺工作者代表大会赵树理致闭幕词，全文如下：
    四天大会胜利地结束了。在这四天之中、有三项大的收获：
    第一、听过了各位首长的讲话和本会的几个报告，经过了简短的讨论，使我们有了一致的方向—也就是说：明确了我们的队伍有多么大，主要的服务对象是谁，这个“务”是如何服法。假如用唱戏来作比，就是已经明确了我们的班社有多么大，座上是些什么观众，因而就决定了这一场应该演些什么节目，怎么样才能演好。
    第二、成立了文联，使我们各个部门的工作者今后容易取得有机的连系，遇了问题有个商量处，并和群众取得连系。过去我们的工作固然也不是毫无连系，但也还有些各自打地洞的现象存在。比方说有些工作部门苦于得不到专家的指导，同时是不是也有些专家们感到无用武之地呢？今后我们有了这样一个团体组织，我们这一万单八将就容易彼此配合得更好一点了。
    第三、提出了好多重要问题：因为大家都有工作岗位，使我们的会不得不在这短短几天中结束，因此不能把所有的问题都解决了。但是各位代表提出七十多件提案（不是条）把比较重要的问题都提出来了。这些问题虽不能一下解决，但是总可以逐步解决。要是没有这次会议，发现一下这许多问题，还说不定得磨多少时间。这也是本会一项很大的收获。此外的收获自然还有，但以上三点，是本会的最大胜利之处，我们这个会就在这胜利中闭幕。
