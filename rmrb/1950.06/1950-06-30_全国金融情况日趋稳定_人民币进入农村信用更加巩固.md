　　The national financial situation is becoming increasingly stable.
    Renminbi's entry into rural areas further consolidates credit.
    [This newspaper] As a result of the nationwide financial and economic unification, the national fiscal revenue and expenditure are approaching a balance month by month, and inflation has stopped, the national financial currency value is becoming more stable. In the past three months, bank deposit balances in various places have surged, people's savings have increased, and interest rates have fallen; the Renminbi has begun to occupy the market in vast rural areas.
    First, bank deposits in various places continue to increase. As of May 24, excluding the Northeast, the balance of state bank deposits increased 3.06 times compared to the end of February. From a regional perspective, the People's Bank of China headquarters increased by 2.08 times, North China (five provinces and two cities) increased by 2.47 times, East China increased by 3.39 times, Central and South China increased by 2.43 times, Northwest China increased by 8.49 times, and Southwest China increased by 7.23 times. During the same period, private banks and financial institutions also saw an increase in deposits. According to statistics from seven major cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Chongqing, as of May 20, the deposit balance increased by 0.75 times compared to February 25. The continued increase in deposits is mainly due to the concentration of large amounts of funds originally dispersed among various military and government agencies and state-owned enterprises in the state banks after the implementation of cash management, as well as the increase in private deposits after price stability.
    Second, financial interest rates are gradually decreasing, and the currency circulation speed is slowing down. In Shanghai, the lending rate on March 1 was 15 yuan per thousand yuan per day, and it has fallen to 1 yuan on May 26. In Beijing, the lending rate on March 1 was 22.5 yuan per thousand yuan per day, and it immediately dropped to 1.7 yuan on May 26; the fixed deposit rate on March 1 was 16 yuan per thousand yuan per day, and it has dropped to 0.65 yuan on May 26. At the same time, with the stabilization of the currency value, some large and medium-sized cities such as Shanghai have successively abolished the daily interest system that had arisen under inflation for more than ten years, and have switched to monthly interest calculation. The underground market interest rate has disappeared, reflecting that speculative trading relying on borrowing has disappeared. The speed of currency circulation has also been greatly reduced. For example, the weekly turnover rate of deposits in the Tianjin People's Bank was 3.57 times in the fourth week of January, and it has been reduced to 0.19 times in the fourth week of April. This all shows that after the currency value stabilizes, the currency circulation speed is also gradually returning to normal.
    Third, due to the increased credit of the Renminbi, savings deposits in banks in various places have been increasing, and real value savings are gradually decreasing, while currency savings are gradually increasing. For example, in Beijing and Tianjin, the balance of various savings deposits on May 30 increased by about one time compared to the end of February. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China saw a twenty-seven-fold increase in the number of currency savings deposit accounts on April 22 compared to March, and a six-hundred-fold increase in the amount. The Qingdao Branch's savings deposit balance on May 20 increased by 60% compared to April, with the percentage of real value savings deposits accounting for the total decreasing from 75% in April to 44%; the amount of currency savings deposits increased from 25% in April to 56%. Among the savings deposit methods, "flexible fixed deposits" and "principal-protected" savings methods are the most popular among the masses. Since the Hankou Branch of the People's Bank of China launched "principal-protected" savings deposits on April 20, as of May 20, more than 9,400 depositors have been recorded in one month, with an amount of 11.9 billion. Since the Qingdao Branch of the People's Bank of China launched "flexible fixed deposits" and "principal-protected" fixed savings deposits on April 11 and 21 respectively, the deposit amount reached 11.8 billion yuan by the end of April. Among the "flexible fixed deposit" depositors, workers accounted for 61%, citizens accounted for 31.5%, private industry and commerce accounted for 6.5%, and others accounted for 1%. Among the "principal-protected" deposit depositors, workers accounted for 49.8%, citizens accounted for 26.6%, and private industry and commerce accounted for 23.6%. Since the currency value stabilized, the deposit terms in various places have gradually changed from a few days or half a month to one month, two months, three months, six months, one year, and even two years.
    Fourth, barter trade has gradually decreased in small and medium-sized county towns, market towns, and rural areas across the country, and farmers have changed from fearing money to loving money and saving money. Rural areas already feel that the Renminbi is not enough. In April, grain companies in Yuxian and Shacheng, Chahar Province, used to exchange cloth for farmers' grain, but the farmers said: We used to be afraid of losing out, so we had to have real goods; now that prices are stable, giving us real goods is too inconvenient to carry around, so let's use Renminbi. In the markets of Gaoyang and Zunhua counties in Hebei Province, barter trade accounted for 80% to 90% of market transactions in February, while currency transactions only accounted for 10% to 20%, and the price of currency transactions was about 10% higher than that of barter trade; in late April, currency transactions accounted for more than 50%, and the price of currency transactions was 5% to 10% lower than that of barter trade. The same situation exists in vast newly liberated areas such as southern Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. A large amount of currency invested by the state-owned China Tea Corporation's Tunxi branch in various counties such as Huizhou and Chizhou for the purchase of tea has mostly flowed into rural areas. In Qimen alone, the company invested 6 billion yuan in Renminbi within twelve days from April 15 to May 6. During the same period, only 2 billion yuan was recovered through state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, banks, and tax bureaus; the remaining 4 billion yuan or so was taken back to the countryside by tea farmers. In the past, when the Miao people in western Hunan and the people in the mountainous areas of southern Jiangxi and western Hubei transported and sold mountain goods and timber, they only wanted silver dollars and did not want currency. Now, most of them do not want silver dollars and only want Renminbi. The Guangzhou market, which had been occupied by Hong Kong dollars for decades, has now been occupied by Renminbi. At present, there is a general feeling of currency shortage in rural areas. How to organize Renminbi to go to the countryside in a planned way to meet the needs of farmers has become the main task of current financial work. (Lu Chaoqi)

### 全国金融情况日趋稳定  人民币进入农村信用更加巩固

　　全国金融情况日趋稳定
    人民币进入农村信用更加巩固
    【本报讯】由于全国财经统一、国家财政收支逐月接近平衡，通货膨胀已经停止，全国金融币值益形稳定。三个月来，各地银行存款余额激增，人民储蓄增加，利率下降；人民币已开始在广大农村占领市场。
    首先是各地银行存款不断增加。截至五月二十四日止，除东北外，国家银行存款余额较二月底增加三·○六倍。从地区来看，人民银行总行增加二·○八倍，华北五省二市增加二·四七倍，华东增加三·三九倍，中南增加二·四三倍，西北增加八·四九倍，西南增加七·二三倍。在同一时期内，私营行庄存款也在增加。据京、津、沪、汉、广州、西安、重庆七大城市的统计，截至五月二十日止，存款余额比二月二十五日增加○·七五倍。存款的继续增加，主要是实行现金管理后，原来分散在各军政机关、公营企业的大量资金集中国家银行，以及物价平稳后，私人存款增加的结果。
    第二、金融利率逐渐降低，通货流通速度缓慢。上海的放款利率，三月一日每千元日息为十五元，五月二十六日已降至一元。北京的放款利率，三月一日每千元日息为二二·五元，五月二十六日即降至一·七元；定期存款，三月一日每千元日息为一六元，五月二十六日已降至○·六五元。同时，随着币值的稳定，上海等若干大、中城市，已先后废止了十几年来在通货膨胀下所产生的日息制，已改为月息计算。市场暗息已经绝迹，反映了依靠拆借来搞的投机买卖，已经消声匿迹。通货流通速度亦已大大减低。如天津人民银行存款通货每周流转速度，在一月份的第四周为三．五七次，四月份的第四周已减至○·一九次。这都说明了币值稳定后，通货流转速度亦日渐趋于正常了。
    第三、由于人民币的信用提高，各地银行的储蓄存款已在增多，且折实储蓄逐渐减少，货币储蓄逐渐增加。如京、津两市，五月三十日各种储蓄存款余额与二月底相较，各增加一倍左右。而人民银行北京分行，四月二十二日的货币储蓄存款余额与三月相较，户数增加二十七倍，金额增加六百倍。青岛分行五月二十日的储蓄存款余额比四月份增加百分之六十，其中折实储蓄存款额占总额的百分比，从四月份的百分之七十五减至百分之四十四；货币储蓄存款额，从四月份的百分之二十五增至百分之五十六。在储蓄存款办法中，以“定活两便”和“保本保值”的储蓄办法最受群众欢迎。人民银行汉口分行自四月二十日举办“保本保值”储蓄存款以来，截至五月二十日止，一个月中存户达九千四百余户，金额达一百一十九亿。人民银行青岛分行，自四月十一日、二十一日分别举办“定活两便”和“保本保值”定期储蓄存款以来，至四月底止，存款金额即达一百一十八亿元。“定活两便”的存款户中，职工占百分之六一，市民占百分之三一·五，私营工商业占百分之六·五，其他占百分之一。“保本保值”的存款户中，职工占百分之四九·八，市民占百分之二六·六，私营工商业占百分之二三·六。定期存款的期限，自从币值稳定后，各地都把以前几天或半月为期的存款，逐渐改为一月、两月、三月、六月、一年以至二年为期的存款。
    第四、全国各中小县城和集镇及农村，物物交易逐渐减少，农民由怕票子转为爱票子和存票子了。农村已感到人民币不够用了。四月间，察南蔚县、沙城的粮食公司，曾习惯地以土布换购农民的粮食，农民却说：以前怕吃亏，不得不要实物；现在物价稳定了，还给实物，提来提去的太不方便，还是用人民币吧。河北省高阳、遵化等县的集市，在二月份的市场交易中，物物交换的占百分之八十到九十，以货币交易的只占百分之十到二十，并且用货币交易的价格要比实物交换的价格高百分之十左右；四月下旬，用货币交易的已占到百分之五十以上，并且用货币交易的价格已低于以实物交换的百分之五至十。皖南、浙江、福建、江西、湖南、湖北等广大的新解放区，也有同样的情形。国营中国茶业公司屯溪分公司，在徽州、池州等各县为收购茶叶所投放的大批货币，绝大部分已经流入农村。该公司仅在祁门一地，自四月十五日至五月六日的十二天内，即投放人民币六十亿元。而在同一时期内，经国营贸易公司、合作社、银行和税局等回笼的货币却只有二十亿元；其余四十亿元左右已被茶农带回农村。湘西苗胞及赣南、鄂西山区的人民，过去运售山货木材时，只要银元，不要货币，现在多数是不要银元，而只要人民币了。几十年来一直被港币占领的广州市场，现在已为人民币占领了。现在，农村中已普遍地感到货币缺乏，如何有计划地组织人民币下乡，满足农民的需要，已成为目前金融工作的主要课题。（陆超祺）
