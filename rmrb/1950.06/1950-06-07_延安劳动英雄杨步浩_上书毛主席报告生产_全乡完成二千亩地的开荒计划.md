Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Yang Buhao, a famous peasant labor hero from the former Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia liberated area, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on May 7th, reporting on the production situation in his hometown – the Sixth Township of Chuankou District, Yan'an County. The letter stated: The peasants of the Sixth Township, after learning in October last year of Chairman Mao's call for them to develop production, heal the wounds of war, improve their lives, and raise their cultural level, responded enthusiastically to this call and launched a vigorous production campaign. They have formulated plans to reclaim wasteland, cultivate intensively, and develop production, and have organized 38 mutual aid teams on the principle of voluntarism and mutual benefit, accounting for more than 49 percent of the total labor force of 380 people. The letter said: The whole township has now completed a reclamation plan of more than 2,000 mu of land, and it is estimated that this year the reclamation plan will be exceeded by more than 1,000 mu. The whole township has now sown 5,970 mu of spring wheat, millet, beans and other crops. Women have also voluntarily organized 14 spinning and weaving groups, which are expected to spin a total of 3,090 jin of cotton and weave 1,030 bolts of cloth throughout the year, which can solve the clothing problem for 515 people. The letter said: They overcame this year's spring famine by promoting the spirit of mutual assistance. This spring, the whole township planted a total of 2,900 trees. A small cooperative was also established, a flour mill was opened, and 15 pigs were raised. The number of cattle in the whole township has increased from 120 head last year to 147 head this spring, and there are 600 sheep. In addition, every two households raise an average of one pig, and every household raises an average of five chickens. The letter also reported that a school has been established in the township, with more than 50 students now. Yang Buhao wrote in the letter: "These are the initial results of implementing your instructions."
　　Yang Buhao concluded: This spring in Yan'an, the rainfall has been timely, and the green wheat seedlings (note: the wheat harvest in Yan'an is about a month later than in Guanzhong) and millet seedlings have raised the masses' enthusiasm for production. Now everywhere you can hear voices praising you: "Chairman Mao calls for great production, and another bumper harvest is coming! Work harder to be worthy of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!"

　　延安劳动英雄杨步浩
    上书毛主席报告生产
    全乡完成二千亩地的开荒计划
    【新华社四日讯】原陕甘宁解放区著名的农民劳动英雄杨步浩于五月七日写信给毛主席，报告他的家乡——延安县川口区六乡的生产情况。信中说：六乡的农民们在去年十月间知道了毛主席号召他们发展生产、医治战争疮伤、改善生活和提高文化后，即纷纷响应这个号召，展开了热火朝天的生产运动。他们已订出增辟荒地、深耕细作、发展生产的计划，并在自愿两利的原则下，组织了变工队三十八组，占全部总劳动力三百八十人的百分之四十九强。信上说：全乡现已完成了二千余亩地的开荒计划，估计今年能超过开荒计划一千亩以上。现在全乡已播种春麦、谷子、豆类等作物五千九百七十亩。妇女们并自动地组织了十四个纺织组，预计全年共可纺花三千零九十斤，织布一千零三十匹，能解决五百一十五人的穿衣问题。信上说：他们是以发扬互助互济的精神，度过了今年的春荒的。今年春季，全乡共植树二千九百株。还成立了小型合作社一个，开设粉房一处，喂猪十五口。全乡耕牛从去年的一百二十犋增加到今春的一百四十七犋，羊子有六百只。此外，每两户平均养一只猪，每一户平均养五只鸡。信上又报告了该乡已办了一个学校，现在有五十多个学生。杨步浩在信上写道：“这都是实行你的指示的初步结果。”
    杨步浩最后写道：我们延安今春雨水适时，绿油油的麦苗（按：延安麦收较关中约迟一个月）和谷苗，提高了群众生产情绪。现在到处都可以听到颂扬你的声音：“毛主席号召大生产，又该丰收啦！加油干，才对得起毛主席和朱总司令哪！”
