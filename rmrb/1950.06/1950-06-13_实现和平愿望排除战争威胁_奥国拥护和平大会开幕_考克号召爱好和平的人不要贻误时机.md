　　Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 12th dispatch: Comprehensive reports from TASS Vienna: The first Austrian National Congress for the Defense of Peace opened in Vienna on the 10th, with 2,000 delegates and many guests attending. The congress received hundreds of congratulatory telegrams from various Austrian and foreign organizations. Father Cock reported on the achievements of the Austrian peace movement and the activities of the Austrian Peace Committee. He pointed out that when the Austrian peace movement first began more than a year ago, it was met with responses from more than 600 social celebrities and many factory workers. At that time, reactionary newspapers and radio stations in the country remained silent on the peace movement, and later turned to obstruction. However, the peace movement finally overcame the obstacles of domestic and international reactionaries and developed irresistibly. People from all walks of life in Austria: Social Democrats, Communists, Protestants, Catholics, non-partisan workers, farmers, artists, doctors, engineers, etc., recognized that atomic bombs and other weapons of war that destroy humanity threaten everyone, and voluntarily participated in the movement to defend peace. As of the opening of the congress, more than 454,000 people had signed the peace declaration. Cock called on all peace-loving people not to stand idly by and miss the opportunity. He said: Together with the worldwide movement for peace, the Austrian peace movement can eliminate the threat of war and realize our common and ardent wish for peace.
    Professor Dublitzberg called on national Catholic organizations to participate in the peace movement. When the representative of the Italian peace advocates, Italian parliamentarian Giolitti, reported that more than 8 million Italians had signed the peace declaration, the audience responded with enthusiastic applause.
    Austrian MP Fischer strongly criticized the Austrian government, the Austrian ruling parties, the reactionary trade union leadership, and the Catholic groups for boycotting the peace movement in his long speech.
    As the meeting was coming to a close, the head of the Soviet Peace Committee delegation, Soviet People's Artist and film director Pudovkin, addressed the congress. His speech was constantly interrupted by storm-like applause and cheers to the great Soviet Union and Stalin, the inspirer of the struggle for world peace and international friendship.
    In the evening, a large-scale rally was held in Vienna to celebrate the first Austrian National Congress for the Defense of Peace. Tens of thousands of residents gathered in the square in front of the City Hall, with the national flags of Austria, the Soviet Union, various People's Democratic countries, the German Democratic Republic, and the People's Republic of China hanging on the rostrum. Austria's Cock, Fischer, the Soviet Union's Pudovkin, Italy's Giolitti, and Czechoslovakia's Projhar all spoke at the meeting. The meeting proceeded in a highly enthusiastic atmosphere.

    【新华社十二日讯】综合塔斯社维也纳消息：奥国全国拥护和平大会首次大会十日在维也纳开幕，参加的有代表两千人及许多来宾。大会收到奥国及外国的许多团体的数百封贺电。考克神父报告了奥国和平运动的成就以及奥国和平委员会的活动。他指出：当一年多以前，奥国和平运动刚开始时，就得到六百多社会名流和许多工厂职工的响应。当时国内反动报纸和电台却对和平运动缄口不谈，后来就转为阻挠。然而，和平运动终于克服了国内和国际反动派的重重障碍，不可抑止地发展起来。奥国的各界人民：社会党人、共产党人、新教徒、天主教徒、无党无派的职工们、农民、艺术工作者、医生、工程师等等，认清了毁灭人类的原子弹以及其他战争武器，威胁着每一个人，就都自愿地参加了拥护和平的运动。至大会开幕时止，已有四十五万四千余人在和平宣言上签了名。考克号召一切爱好和平的人们不要袖手旁观，贻误时机。他说：与全世界争取和平的运动一起，奥地利的和平运动可以排除战争的威胁，实现我们共同的热烈的和平愿望。
    杜布利兹贝格教授号召全国的天主教组织参加和平运动。当意大利和平拥护者代表、意大利议员吉奥利蒂报告八百多万意大利人已在和平宣言上签名时，听众报以热烈的掌声。
    奥议员费希尔曾在他的长篇演说中，强烈地指责奥国政府、奥国统治政党、反动的工会领导机构及天主教团的抵制和平运动。
    会议将结束时，苏联和平委员会代表团团长、苏联人民艺术家及电影导演蒲多夫金向大会致词。他的演说不断地为风暴般的掌声及向伟大苏联、和为争取全世界和平与国际友好的斗争的鼓舞者——斯大林致敬的欢呼所打断。
    晚间，维也纳举行大规模集会，庆祝奥地利全国拥护和平大会首次大会。成千成万的居民聚集在市政厅前的广场上，主席台上悬挂着奥地利、苏联、各人民民主国家、德意志民主共和国及中华人民共和国的国旗。奥国的考克、费希尔，苏联的蒲多夫金，意大利的吉奥利蒂和捷克斯洛伐克的普洛伊哈都曾在会上发言。会议在高度热烈的气氛中进行。
