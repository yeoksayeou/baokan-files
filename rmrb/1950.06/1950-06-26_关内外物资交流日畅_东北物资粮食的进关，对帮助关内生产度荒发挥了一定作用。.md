Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th. Under the overall planning and regulation of the Central People's Government, trade between Northeast China and the areas inside the customs is developing rapidly, and the exchange of materials between the two regions is becoming increasingly prosperous. According to incomplete statistics from the three ports of Shanhaiguan, Yingkou, and Andong from January to May this year, the total value of material exchanges between Northeast China and the areas inside the customs (excluding allocations from the Industrial Bank and other units) was 278% higher than the total value of exchanges from May to December last year. Among these materials, state-owned and public enterprises accounted for 70.1%, cooperative enterprises accounted for 2.6%, and private enterprises accounted for 27.3%. Of the total value of exchanged materials, 42% were transported from inside the customs to Northeast China, and 58% were imported from Northeast China to inside the customs.

Of the materials transported from Northeast China to inside the customs, timber, paper, industrial fuel oil, chemical industrial raw materials, ammonium sulfate, electrical materials, and machinery accounted for 31.9% of the total value of exported materials; scrap iron, steel bars, sand, gravel, porcelain, and other building materials accounted for 27.8%; various grains accounted for 22.4%; and mountain and marine products, dried mushrooms, tree fungus, fresh fruits, eggs, medicinal materials, and hides and skins, and other non-staple foods and local products accounted for 17.9%. Among the materials transported from inside the customs to Northeast China, cotton yarn and cloth ranked first, accounting for 35.8% of the total value of imported materials; chemical industrial products accounted for 21.2%; electrical materials and machinery accounted for 15.6%; bamboo, reed mats, and other agricultural implements for farmers accounted for 6.5%; other miscellaneous goods accounted for 15.1%; and building materials suitable for Northeast China accounted for 5.8%. The exchange of these materials has supplied the needs of the people in Northeast China for production and life, and has played a certain role in stabilizing commodity prices inside the customs, opening up the stagnant market for materials inside the customs, and assisting private manufacturers in capital turnover. The entry of Northeast grain into the customs has helped large and medium-sized cities and disaster areas inside the customs solve the problem of grain shortage.

At present, in the exchange of materials between Northeast China and the areas inside the customs, the purchase and sale of other materials besides major commodities such as grain, cotton yarn and cloth, and timber are still far behind the needs of both parties. In the future, under the unified planning of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, more planned mutual procurement will be carried out to meet the needs of developing production and people's lives inside and outside the customs.

　　关内外物资交流日畅
    东北物资粮食的进关，对帮助关内生产度荒发挥了一定作用。
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】在中央人民政府统筹调剂下，东北与关内的贸易日益发展，关内外物资交流日趋畅旺。据今年一月到五月，山海关、营口、安东三个口岸的不完全统计：东北与关内物资交流、总值（工业银行等单位调拨除外）为去年五月到十二月交流总值的百分之二百七十八强，这些物资中，国营和公营企业占百分之七十点一，合作社企业占百分之二点六，私营企业占百分之二十七点三。交流物资总值内，关内运往东北的占百分之四十二，东北输入关内的为百分之五十八。
    由东北输至关内的物资中，木材、纸张、工业用燃料油、化学工业原料、硫安、电料、机械等占出境物资总值的百分之三十一点九，废铁、铁筋、砂石、陶磁器等建筑器材，占百分之二十七点八，各种谷物占百分之二十二点四，山海杂货、元蘑、木耳、鲜果、鸡蛋、药材、皮张等副食品与土产品占百分之十七点九。由关内输至东北的物资以花纱布居首位，占入境物资总值百分之三十五点八，化学工业品占百分之二十一点二，电料机械占百分之十五点六，毛竹、苇席等农民用农具占百分之六点五，其他各种杂品占百分之十五点一，适合东北的建筑材料占百分之五点八。这些物资的交流，供应了东北人民生产和生活上的需要，并曾于稳定关内物价，打开关内物资滞销局面，扶助私营厂商资金周转方面，发挥了一定的作用。东北粮食的进关，则协助了关内大中城市和灾区解决了缺粮的困难。
    目前东北与关内的物资交流中，除粮食、纱布、木材等主要商品外，其他物资的购销还远落在双方需要之后；今后将在中央人民政府贸易部统一筹划下，更有计划地互相采购，以适应关内外发展生产和人民生活的需要。
