　　Hot Repair of No. 17 Furnace
　　By our reporter Feng Zhong
　　The second day after the signing of the collective contract at the Shijingshan Power Plant—at 8:40 p.m. on June 2nd, the back insulation wall inside the No. 17 pulverized coal furnace suddenly collapsed. Two-thirds of the wall bricks were loosened, and more than 200 refractory bricks fell off. The outer iron plate was burned red, a very serious situation. According to past experience, the furnace had to be shut down for repairs, which would take at least three or four days. However, the collective contract stipulated a daily output quota of 52,700 kilowatts. If No. 17 furnace was shut down, it would be necessary to burn low-pressure furnaces instead. The low-pressure furnaces in this plant are the oldest and clumsiest machines, requiring coal to be added shovel by shovel manually. Coal consumption is twice as high as that of high-pressure furnaces, which would inevitably exceed the coal consumption standard stipulated in the collective contract. This was indeed a difficult problem. However, encouraged by the workers' determination to fulfill the collective contract, they did not bow to difficulties, and displayed a high degree of initiative and creativity. Communist Party members took the lead, braving the high temperatures to enter the furnace for emergency repairs. With the close cooperation of crane workers, bricklayers, ironworkers, and welders, and the spontaneous help of workers from various fields, they overcame the difficulties and created a new record of completing furnace repairs in ten hours.

　　When the news of the brick falling from No. 17 furnace spread, the boiler shop workers were extremely anxious, worrying about not being able to complete the production plan stipulated in the collective contract. Bricklayers who had already gone home to sleep hurried back; workers from the turbine shop who had just left the factory after get off work, also ran back to help brainstorm ideas, they said: "If a problem occurs in one place, the entire plant will fail to complete the production plan. If something happens to the boiler shop, it's the same as something happening to the turbine shop." Dozens of workers and technicians surrounded the pulverized coal furnace, holding meetings to discuss solutions. Some suggested adding insulation outside the iron plate, and others advocated drilling holes in the iron plate and applying chicken feather ash inside, but neither was a long-term solution. What if the brick wall inside the boiler collapsed further before the situation was clear? What if the iron plate was burned through? After discussing until midnight, Communist Party members Dai Fengnian, Zheng Guotai, Zhang Chundi, and others suddenly remembered seeing news reports about hot repairs of Martin furnaces in the newspaper and firmly advocated rushing into the furnace for emergency repairs the next morning, braving the high temperatures, striving to complete the work during the daytime when the load was at its lowest, so as not to delay the evening power generation. After everyone could not think of a better solution, they decided to do so.

　　At night, they began to release steam, add cold water, open the inspection doors to let in cold air, and turn on the suction fan to extract the hot air. The temperature inside the furnace slowly decreased. The director and deputy director of the boiler shop ran over at four o'clock in the morning, continuously tested the furnace temperature, opened the manhole cover, and checked the brick falling situation. The workers also arrived one after another, vying to be the first to enter the furnace. Everyone said: "This is an opportunity to become a labor hero, we cannot fall behind."

　　At 8:15 a.m., the furnace temperature had dropped to over seventy degrees. Crane workers Ling Xumu, Zhang Wenxing, and Zhao Kun first drilled into the furnace. Zheng Guotai, Zhang Chundi, and others, fearing to fall behind, also followed in. The first step was to erect scaffolding. Only five crane workers had the skills. Zhang Chundi and Liu Guoyi, the operators of No. 17 furnace, had learned this skill before, so they went up the scaffolding to help tie it. The furnace was filled with ash and smoke, the brick walls were scorching hot, and the water pipes were burning to the touch. The workers' faces were roasted red, and sweat was constantly flowing, soaking through two layers of clothing, but their spirits remained high. When they felt dizzy, they came out to cool off for a dozen minutes, then continued to work, Crane worker Zhou Changhe fainted, and Ling Xumu also vomited several times, but after drinking some water, taking some medicine, and resting for a while, they drilled back in and insisted on working until the task was completed.

　　Erecting scaffolding used to take more than a day, but this time it was completed in four hours. At this time, the bricklayers had already transported enough bricks and ash, and immediately began to repair the furnace wall. Everyone calculated that if they could finish bricklaying in four hours and dismantling the scaffolding in one hour, they would not delay the previous night's power generation. Li Kejiu, the leader of the bricklayers, and worker Wei Jun did not even eat lunch to save time. Four bricklayers from the civil engineering section also came to help chisel bricks. Workers who did not have bricklaying skills helped carry bricks and fetch ash. At the same time, in the place where iron frames were being welded, ironworker Ning Cunyou and Geng Pingan kept hammering frames, and welding leader Dou Yu and worker Wang Yitian followed to weld the frames. At 4:35 p.m., the entire back wall where the bricks had fallen was repaired, with a total of more than 1,500 new refractory bricks laid. Finally, they started dismantling the scaffolding. The workers from the overhaul and repair crews of the boiler shop were just getting off work and all rushed to help, untying ropes, carrying poles, not distinguishing whether you were a crane worker or a repairman. Everyone had only one goal—to complete the production plan and ensure the fulfillment of the collective contract. At six o'clock, all the emergency repairs were completed. After eight o'clock, when the load was at its highest, No. 17 furnace once again shouldered its due responsibility.

　　A total of 40 workers participated in the emergency repairs. Everyone gathered around No. 17 furnace to hold a celebration meeting, and the song "We Workers Have Strength" resounded through the sky.

　　热修十七号炉
    本报记者  冯仲
    石景山发电厂签订集体合同的第二天——六月二日晚八时四十分，十七号煤粉炉内后面保温墙突然倒塌，墙砖有三分之二松动，掉落二百多块耐火砖，外面铁板被烧红了，情况相当严重。根据过去经验，必须停炉修理，最少也要三、四天工夫。但集体合同中规定每日出力定额五万二千七百千瓦，如十七号炉停烧，需增烧低压炉代替。该厂低压炉是最老笨的机器，需要人工一铲铲的添煤，用煤量较高压炉多一倍，这样又必然超过集体合同中规定的煤耗标准。这确是一个难题。但工人们被坚决完成集体合同的愿望鼓舞着，并未向困难低头，发挥了高度的积极性与创造性。共产党员带头，冒高温进炉内抢修。在起重工、瓦工、铁工、焊工紧密配合，各场工人自动帮助下，克服了困难，创造了十小时完成修炉工作的新纪录。
    当十七号炉掉砖的消息传出后，锅炉场工人一个个焦急万分，担心完不成集体合同规定的生产计划。瓦工已经回家睡觉又赶了来；汽机场工人下班刚出厂子，听到消息也跑回帮着出主意，他们说：“一处发生故障，全厂就完不成生产计划，锅炉场出事，就等于汽机场出事。”几十个工人、技术员围着煤粉炉团团转，开会研究办法。有人提议在铁板外加包温，有人主张在铁板上打洞，向里边涂鸡毛灰，但都非长久之计。锅炉里面砖墙倒塌情形没弄清，再继续倒塌怎么办？铁板被烧化了又怎么办？商量到半夜，共产党员戴丰年、郑国太、张春弟等忽然想起曾经看见报上登过热修马丁炉的新闻，坚决主张第二天早晨冒高温进炉抢修，争取在负荷最低的白天完成，不误晚间发电。当大家再也想不出更好的办法之后，大家就这样决定下来了。
    夜间开始放汽，上冷水，打开看火门通冷风，开吸风机抽热温，炉内温度慢慢降低了。锅炉场正副主任早晨四点钟就跑来，连续试验炉膛温度，打开入孔门，查看掉砖情况。工人们也陆续来了，争着要先进炉，大家说：“这可是当劳动英雄的机会，不能落后。”
    八点一刻，炉温已减至七十多度，起重工凌需木、张文兴、赵昆首先钻进炉去，郑国太、张春弟等唯恐落后，也跟着进去。第一步是绑架子，只五个起重工有技术，十七号炉运行工张春弟、刘国义以前学过这手艺，就上架子帮助绑。炉内灰烟呛眼，四面砖墙滚热，水管炙手，工人们脸被烤得通红，汗水不停地流，湿透两重衣褂，但精神始终旺盛。头发昏了，出来凉快十几分钟，又继续干，起重工周长和晕倒了，凌需木也呕吐几次，但喝些水，吃点药，休息片刻又钻进去，坚持干到完成。
    以前绑架子是一天多的活，这次四小时就干完了。这时瓦工早已运来足够用的砖和灰，立即动手修炉墙。大家核算着，如砌墙用四个小时、拆架子用一个小时赶完，就不误前夜发电。瓦工领班李克久，工人魏钧曾为抢时间，连午饭都没吃。土木股四名瓦工也来帮助凿砖，没有砌墙技术的工人，就帮着搬砖拿灰。同时，在焊铁框子的地方，铁工宁存友、耿平安不停地打框子，焊工领班窦钰、工人王义田跟着就把框子焊好。下午四时三十五分，掉砖的后墙全部补完，共新砌耐火砖一千五百多块。最后动手拆架子，锅炉场的大修、检修各班工人正下班，都赶来帮忙，解绳子，扛杆子，也不分你是起重工、我是修理工了，大家只有一条心——完成生产计划，保证实现集体合同的规定。六点钟全部抢修完工，八点以后负荷最高时，十七号炉又负起它应尽的任务。
    参加抢修的工人先后达四十人，大家围着十七号炉开起庆祝会，“我们工人有力量”的歌声响彻了云霄。
