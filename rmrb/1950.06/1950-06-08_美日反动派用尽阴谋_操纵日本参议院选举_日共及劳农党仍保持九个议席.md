　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 7th: The results of the Japanese House of Councillors election have been fully revealed. Although the reactionaries exhausted all conspiracies, two candidates from the Japanese Communist Party were still elected. The progressive Labour-Farmer Party also won two seats. The number of seats obtained by other conservative parties is as follows: 52 seats for Yoshida's Liberal Party, 36 seats for the Socialist Party, 9 seats each for the People's Democratic Party (formed in April by the merger of the conservative Democratic Party, the National Cooperative Party, and the New Political Council) and the Ryokufukai; in addition, 22 seats for independents and small parties. After this by-election, the distribution of all seats in the Japanese House of Councillors is as follows: 4 seats for the Japanese Communist Party, 5 seats for the Labour-Farmer Party, 76 seats for the Liberal Party, 61 seats for the Socialist Party, 50 seats for the Ryokufukai, 29 seats for the People's Democratic Party, and 25 seats for independents and small parties.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, TASS dispatch from Tokyo on June 6th: The Japanese House of Councillors election was held on the 4th. This election was to elect half of the seats in the House of Councillors with a three-year term and seven vacancies. The Japanese Communist Party's campaign was carried out under the slogans of fighting for Japan's peace and national independence, concluding a peace treaty with the victorious nations as soon as possible, and withdrawing the American occupation forces.
    In order to prevent the election of Communist candidates, the Japanese reactionary forces colluded with the American occupation authorities and launched a vicious anti-communist movement long before the election even began. Japanese politicians, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, competed to slander the Japanese Communist Party and discredit the reputation of the candidates nominated by the Communist Party.
    MacArthur's headquarters also repeatedly made defamatory remarks against the Japanese Communist Party, nakedly demanding the outlawing of the Japanese Communist Party. It is no coincidence that MacArthur has twice recently come out to demand that the Japanese Communist Party be declared illegal.
    On the eve of the election, the American occupation authorities held a provocative interrogation of eight participants in the Japanese labor people's rally in Tokyo, giving it a vicious anti-communist nature. On the day of the election, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida declared that his first action when convening a meeting of the Japanese Diet would be to propose a bill to outlaw the Communist Party.
    The election on the 4th was held in an atmosphere of police terror. In Tokyo alone, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries mobilized 25,000 police officers. Police reinforcements filled the streets of the Japanese capital. In order to create chaos and undermine the election of Communist candidates, the police arrested ten Communists who were engaged in campaign work. The Japanese police authorities prohibited all gatherings and demonstrations, and guard lines were placed around parks and squares, creating an atmosphere similar to martial law in Tokyo.
    In addition to this, the reactionary election management committee also used all kinds of fraudulent means on the voter list. It is reported that in many places hundreds of voters were not included on the voter list. For example, in Toyohashi (central Japan), more than 500 people were not included on the voter list; in Yakage Village, Okayama Prefecture, more than 800 voters were not included on the voter list. Similar situations occurred in many other towns and villages. The reactionaries also used bribery and intimidation against voters.

### 美日反动派用尽阴谋  操纵日本参议院选举  日共及劳农党仍保持九个议席

　　美日反动派用尽阴谋  操纵日本参议院选举    
    日共及劳农党仍保持九个议席
    【新华社七日讯】东京七日消息：日本参院选举业已全部揭晓。虽然反动派用尽一切阴谋，日本共产党的候选人仍有二名当选。进步的劳农党亦获得二席。其他保守党派所获得的席数为：吉田的自由党五十二席，社会党三十六席，国民民主党（按系四月间由保守的民主党、国民协同党及新政治协议会合并而建立的）及绿风会各九席；此外，无党无派人士及小党派共二十二席。日本参院经过这次改选后，全部议席的分配如下：日本共产党四席，劳农党五席，自由党七十六席，社会党六十一席，绿风会五十席，国民民主党二十九席，无党无派人士及小党派共二十五席。
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社六日电引东京消息：日本参院选举于四日举行。这次选举是要选出参院中半数任期三年的议席及缺额七席。日本共产党的竞选是在为日本的和平与民族独立、尽早与战胜国缔结和约以及撤退美国占领军而斗争等口号下进行的。
    为了要阻止共产党候选人的当选，日本反动势力与美国占领当局串通一气，在选举还未开始以前很久，就发动了恶毒的反共运动。以首相吉田茂为首的日本政客们，争先恐后地诽谤日本共产党。并诋毁共产党所提名的候选人的名誉。
    麦克阿瑟总部也再三对日本共产党发表诽谤的言论，赤裸裸地要求取缔日本共产党。麦克阿瑟最近两次出面要求宣布日本共产党为非法，也并不是偶然的。
    在大选前夕，美国占领当局，对东京日本劳动人民群众大会的八个参加者，举行了挑拨性的审讯，使之带上了恶毒的反共性质。在选举这一天，日本首相吉田声明，他在日本国会召开会议时的第一步行动，就是要提出一个取缔共产党的法案。
    四日的选举是在警察恐怖的气氛中举行的。仅在东京一地，美日反动派就动员了二万五千名警察。警察的增援队伍布满了日本首都的各条街道。为了要引起混乱和破坏共产党候选人当选，警察逮捕了十名正在从事竞选工作的共产党人。日本警察当局禁止一切的集会与示威，在公园和广场周围布满哨兵线，在东京造成一种类似戒严的空气。
    除此以外，反动的选举管理委员会还在选民名单上用尽各种舞弊手段。据报道，在许多地方有数百选民均未被列入选民名单上。例如，丰桥（日本中部）有五百多人未被列入选民名单；冈山县的矢挂村，有八百余选民未被列入选民名单。其他许多村镇也有相似的情形。反动派并对选民施行贿赂与威吓。
