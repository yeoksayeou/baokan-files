[Beijing News Agency] Under the leadership of the 20th District Government of Beijing, the Western Beijing Mining Bureau, and the Menkou Coal Mine Trade Union, the representatives of labor and management from 89 private coal mines in Western Beijing formally established a labor-management consultation conference. After the establishment of the consultation conference, it first focused on several urgent problems existing in the industry and conducted consultations. Among them, issues such as rewarding overproduction, engineering safety, adjusting the minimum wage standards for direct and indirect production workers, and abolishing the commission system for the "Zuotou" (foreman) wages in various kilns and mines have now reached agreements, and specific solutions have been clearly formulated:

(1) In order to encourage workers' production enthusiasm, the meeting decided to implement a bonus system for overproduction. Kilns and mines with a monthly output exceeding 300 tons will receive a 2% bonus for the excess, with half going to the "Zuotou" (the most experienced coal mining technicians) and half to the employees.

(2) In order to protect workers' production safety and reduce casualties, the "Zuotou" of each kiln and mine must strengthen their sense of responsibility for engineering safety and implement a responsible handover system for coal mining work areas. It is stipulated that during shift changes, the leading "Zuotou" must explain the coal mining situation in detail to avoid danger due to the incoming shift not knowing the details.

(3) Abolish the commission system for "Zuotou" wages: The commission system meant that the "Zuotou" wages were based on the amount of coal produced, resulting in large wage disparities. For example, in April, some kiln "Zuotou" received more than 1,200 jin of rice per person, while those in kilns with low coal output only received a little over 110 jin. The consultation conference fully discussed this unreasonable wage system and finally decided to uniformly change it to a base salary system, stipulating a monthly salary of 300 jin of millet per person.

(4) Adjust the minimum wage standards for direct and indirect production workers, on the one hand, to encourage non-direct production personnel to switch to direct production, and on the other hand, to take care of kilns and mines with poor current production and sales conditions and too many non-direct production personnel. It is stipulated that the minimum wage standard for clerks and handymen will remain at 150 jin of millet, changing from wage rice to rationed millet; the daily wage rice for "Da Huo Gong" (direct production workers) will be increased from ten jin to eleven jin, issued as rationed millet, and the employer will provide drinking water and burning coal.

　　京西八十九家私营煤窑
    正式成立劳资协商会议
    【京市新闻处讯】京西私营煤窑业八十九家劳资双方代表在京市第二十区区政府、京西矿务处及门矿工会领导下，正式成立了劳资协商会议。该协商会议成立后，首先针对该业目前存在着的几个急待解决的问题，进行协商，其中如奖励超额生产、工程安全及调整直接与非直接生产工人的最低工资标准、废除各窑矿作头工资的佣钱制度等问题，现已获致协议，明确订出各项解决办法：
    （一）为鼓励工人生产情绪，会议决定实行超额生产的奖励办法。每月产量超过三百吨以上的窑矿，其超额部分按百分之二提奖，一半分给作头（最有经验的采煤技术工人）一半分给职工。
    （二）为保护工人生产安全，减少伤亡，各窑矿作头须加强对工程安全的责任心，实行采煤活地交接班负责制度。规定在换班时，领班作头必须将采煤进行情况详细交代清楚，以免接班的不知底细，发生危险。
    （三）废除作头工资的佣钱制度：佣钱制度是作头工资按产煤多少提成，因而工资相差悬殊。如四月份有的窑矿作头每人拿一千二百多斤米，出煤少的窑矿有的只拿一百一十多斤。协商会议对于这种不合理的工资制度，作了充分的讨论，最后决定统改为底薪制，规定每人每月工资三百斤小米。
    （四）调整直接与间接参加生产工人的最低工资标准，一方面鼓励非直接参加生产人员转向直接生产，一方面照顾目前产销情况不好非直接生产人员过多的窑矿。规定职员杂工最低工资标准仍为一百五十斤小米，改由工资米降低为口小米；大活工（直接生产工人）每天工资米十斤改为十一斤，按口小米发给，并由资方供给吃水、烧煤。
