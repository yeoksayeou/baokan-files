　　Yuanshi Emphasizes Wheat Seed Selection
    Deeply Mobilizing the Masses for Individual Plant Selection

    [This Newspaper, Yuanshi News] Farmers in Yuanshi County, Hebei Province are actively preparing for wheat seed selection. The county leadership has conducted detailed research on seed selection work, determining to deeply mobilize the masses (especially women and children) to carry out individual plant selection, delineate seed selection areas, and select superior varieties with strong resistance to jaundice. At the same time, model grain growers are mobilized to harvest and thresh separately, setting aside seed for themselves and exchanging it with others or the public. During the investigation of wheat jaundice disease in various villages, it was found that wheat varieties such as Huanong No. 5, Baitouweng (local name, short and thick ears), Dabaimai, and Hongpimai have relatively strong resistance to jaundice. For example, Li Daping in Chi Village planted two mu of Huanong No. 5. The neighboring fields on both sides were planted with local wheat and had jaundice, while his wheat, although also infected with jaundice, was lighter and the yield was higher than the local wheat. Cadres in various districts and villages immediately used examples to carry out propaganda and education among the masses, making them realize that "a little more effort this year will result in better harvests in the future." According to statistics from twenty-six villages in the first, second, and fifth districts, eight hundred and forty-five households with three thousand two hundred and forty-seven mu of wheat have been designated as seed selection areas. All villages have obtained complete agreement from the owners concerned and are carrying out mutual selection and exchange.

　　元氏重视小麦选种
    深入发动群众进行株选
    【本报元氏讯】河北省元氏县农民积极准备小麦选种。该县领导上曾对选种工作作了详细研究，确定要深入发动群众（特别是妇女儿童）进行株选，划分选种区，挑选抗黄疸力强的优良品种。同时，动员良种户另割另打，除自己留种外，换给别人或公家。各村在调查小麦黄疸病情况时，发现华农五号、白头翁（土名，穗短而粗）、大白麦、红皮麦等麦种抗黄疸力较强。如池村李大平种的二亩华农五号，两边地邻都种的本地麦，有黄疸病，他的麦子虽也染上了黄疸，但比较轻，而产量也高于本地麦。各区村干部即拿实例向群众展开宣传教育，使群众认识了“今年费点事，今后收成好”。据一、二、五区二十六个村统计，已有八百四十五户、三千二百四十七亩小麦确定为选种区，各村均已征得本主完全同意，进行互选互换。
