　　Housewife Zhang Shumin
　　Achieves Progress in Learning

　　Over two hundred students studying at the Beijing Normal University Adult Night School have made significant progress in culture and ideology. The majority of students are workers and housewives. Zhang Shumin, a student in the Intermediate Class B, was a housewife with strong feudal ideas when she first enrolled. She was married at the age of fifteen and lived an eleven-year hellish life under the constant abuse of her husband. Once, her husband threw knives, scissors, and ropes in front of her, telling her to die, complaining that she couldn't swim, dance, ice skate, or talk about fashionable things. Her husband sold all sixteen houses, yet said his wife had bad luck, calling her a jinx, and resorted to fists and kicks at the slightest dissatisfaction. After Liberation, her husband still didn't realize the error of his ways and proposed a divorce to Zhang Shumin. She was unwilling to divorce her husband. She thought: I would rather endure all the suffering until I die than be divorced and looked down upon. After she came to the school to study, she gradually realized that women must have the ability to live independently in order not to be oppressed and to have freedom.
　　Now she is a female worker doing work in the Gongjian Hutong Women's Production Cooperative, and continues to come to school to study every day after work. When the Municipal Women's Federation holds report meetings, she also makes time to listen. She is determined to work hard and study hard from now on, hoping to go to Revolutionary University to study in the future, in order to better serve the people.

　　家庭妇女张淑敏
    在学习中获得了进步
    在北京师范大学成人夜校学习的二百多位同学，在文化上、思想上都有显著的进步。同学中以工人和家庭妇女占大多数。中级乙班张淑敏同学，刚入学的时候，还是一位有着浓厚的封建思想的家庭妇女。她十五岁就出嫁了，在丈夫百般虐待下，过了十一年地狱般的生活。有一次，她的丈夫曾把刀子、剪子、绳子扔在她的跟前，叫她死，嫌她不会游泳、跳舞、溜冰、讲时髦。她丈夫把十六所房子都卖光了，却说妻子命不好，说她败家精，一不称心，就是拳打脚踢。解放后她的丈夫仍不觉悟，又向张淑敏提出离婚。她不愿跟丈夫离婚。她想：宁可受尽一切苦痛，熬到死，也不愿离婚被人轻视。从她来到学校学习以后，她渐渐认识了妇女要有独立生活的能力，才不会被压迫，才有自由。
    现在她已是恭俭胡同妇女生产合作社做活计的女工，每天下工继续来学校学习。遇到市妇联开报告会，她也抽空去听。她决心从现在起好好工作，好好学习，希望以后能上革命大学去学习，以便更好地为人民服务。
