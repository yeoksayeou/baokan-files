　　On the Question of Ruler Algorithms: Comrade Yu Zhanshan Answers Readers

Editor:

　　Since the *People's Daily* published the article "Yu Zhenshan, the Inventor of the Ruler Algorithm," on May 19, readers have written letters asking me to explain the principle and application of the ruler algorithm, and asking where they can buy books and calculators for the ruler algorithm. Here are brief answers to the questions raised by readers:

　　The book *Yu Zhenshan's Ruler Algorithm*, previously published by the Jinchaji Xinhua Bookstore, has long been sold out. This book has now been supplemented, revised, and submitted to the Ministry of Education for review. It can be published after review. This "ruler algorithm" can be used to learn addition, subtraction, combined addition and subtraction, multiplication, division, combined multiplication and division, land measurement, mutual conversion between liang and jin, conversion, proportions, percentages, and root extraction (square root, cube root) within four hours. Those without an arithmetic foundation will find it quite convenient to use.

　　Circular ruler calculators (both single and double versions) can be purchased from the Tianjin Printing House at 251 Dongma Road, Tianjin. The price of each ruler calculator is equal to 30 jin of the best Beihe millet in Tianjin, with a 10% discount for those with letters of introduction from organizations and schools. People from distant places can order by mail. Those who cannot afford to buy one can make one themselves according to the diagrams.

　　Sincerely,

　　Yu Zhenshan

　　关于尺算法问题  于振善同志答读者编辑同志：
    自从五月十九号人民日报登载了《尺算法的发明者于振善同志》一文后，读者纷纷来信，要我解释尺算法的原理及运用方法，并问到什么地方可以买到尺算法的书和尺算器。现将读者所提问题，简要答复如下：
    过去晋察冀新华书店出版的《于振善尺算法》一书，早已卖光。现在已将此书加以补充修改，送请教育部审查。审查后即可出版。这种“尺算法”，在四小时内就能学会加法、减法、加减连算、乘法、除法、乘除连算、地亩、两斤互求、折合、比例、百分法、开方（平方、立方）等。如再深造，还能算部分的代数、三角、几何。没有算术基础的人，运用起来颇为方便。
    圆形尺算器（有单式复式二种），在天津东马路二百五十一号天津制版社可以买到。每个尺算器价格等于天津最好北河小米三十斤，有机关学校介绍信者九折优待。远地人士可以函购。无钱购买的人，可以按照图样自己制造。
    此致敬礼
                                          于振善
                                              六月十六日
