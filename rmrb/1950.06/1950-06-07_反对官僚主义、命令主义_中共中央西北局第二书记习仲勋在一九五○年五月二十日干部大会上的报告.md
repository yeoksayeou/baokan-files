　　Comrades: Today is the anniversary of the liberation of Xi'an. It is meaningful that we recall our work over the past year, analyze the situation, point out existing problems, and study solutions on this day to draw the attention of all Party members. Today, I will talk about opposing the bureaucratic and commandist style of thinking in our work.

    I. The Greatest Danger in Our Work

    Since entering the new areas last year, what changes have taken place in our work? First of all, we have achieved a great victory: liberating the five provinces of the Northwest, establishing people's governments at all levels, and beginning various tasks. The arrival of this victory was rapid and smooth. But this rapid and smooth great victory also has another aspect: that is, our work tasks are very heavy, but the subjective forces leading these tasks are not strong enough. In our local work, new cadres account for more than 90 percent, and they have not had time to be educated and transformed. Many of them are still using the old work styles and methods from the Kuomintang era to deal with work; there are very few veteran cadres, and most of them are not good at grasping the situation in the new areas. Many people are developing a sense of pride in the victory, to the point of being infected with various non-proletarian ideas. This has led to the development of various forms of bureaucratic work style in our leading organs, and a serious commandist work style in the organs executing the work below (which is also a manifestation of bureaucracy). As a result, it has damaged the close ties between our Party and the masses of the people. This has become the greatest danger in our work.

    Since Chairman Peng called for opposing corruption, waste, and departmentalism in March, various organs, organizations, and units of the Party, government, military, and people in this area have launched a mass movement against unhealthy tendencies for more than two months. Various provinces and regions have also actively responded. Wherever this movement has been launched, there have been great achievements: corruption and illegal and undisciplined behaviors have been sanctioned by law, extravagance and waste have been significantly reduced, cadres and the masses have been educated, and work has begun to improve. Most importantly, it has progressed from the general opposition to unhealthy tendencies to an in-depth inspection of the leadership work of various professional departments and enterprises. This has hit the key point and illuminated the deepest shadows in our work. Countless vivid facts prove that it is bureaucracy in leadership work that enables various unhealthy tendencies (corruption, illegal and undisciplined behaviors, extravagance and waste, etc.) to exist and develop. It is the bureaucracy of the leading organs and the commandism in the work execution below that cause significant losses to state property and the public and private economy (public and private enterprises, mass production). This is already very clear.

    Our current task is to lead the masses to continue to universally launch and deepen the anti-unhealthy tendency movement, and guide the movement towards carrying out comprehensive inspections and opposing bureaucracy and commandism. There are two deviations to be aware of and correct: one is that leaders adopt a bureaucratic attitude towards the anti-unhealthy tendency movement, do not study the mass movement, do not guide it, and shelve the events that have been exposed, failing to educate and improve the masses through the handling of these specific events, and failing to absorb the opinions of the masses to improve work. Some even use "anti-extravagance" as a shield to refuse to improve work, making the lower levels feel "useless" and "helpless," and become depressed. The other is that the masses, with egalitarian and ultra-democratic sentiments, endlessly pursue trivial details of life. This will cause the movement to lose its direction, make the masses unable to see the future, and be of no benefit to work. The correct principle is to handle matters according to the actual situation. Anything that is not necessary, even if it costs a penny, is a waste; and things that must be done, even if they cost millions, are appropriate. Therefore, in the process of developing the mass movement, we must closely monitor the ideological dynamics of the masses, grasp the direction, and guide the masses to advance along the correct path of opposing bureaucracy and commandism, in order to achieve the purpose of connecting with the masses, establishing various necessary work systems, and improving work efficiency.

    II. Exposing Bureaucracy and Commandism

    The characteristic of bureaucracy is detachment from reality and detachment from the masses. The reason why our cause is great is because we are wholeheartedly fighting for the interests of the entire people. Only by mobilizing millions of people to act under our leadership can we achieve victory and consolidate our victory. If our thinking and work style are not correct, and if we allow the political germs of bureaucracy and commandism to corrode us, and we do not pay attention and seek correction, our various tasks will not be done well, we will lose the love of the masses, and the masses may even leave us, making the great victory we have already won impossible to consolidate, and causing us to suffer failure.

    Unfortunately, there are many, many forms of bureaucracy in our leadership work.

    Let's look at the issue of lending improved cotton seeds! This year, the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Department of Agriculture and Forestry lent more than 2.6 million catties of cotton seeds in the Guanzhong area, which could plant more than 170,000 mu. This is a major task for the department and a major event related to the lives of millions of people. But we did not do it well. The seedlings in most areas are growing very poorly. The worst have only a 10% seedling rate, and must be replanted or re-sown. It is estimated that the state investment has lost more than 3 billion, and the loss to the masses is even greater, directly affecting the plan to increase cotton production. The loss of political prestige suffered by the people's government in leading the production cause is an incalculable loss. A careful study of this matter shows that from acquisition to storage, testing, and distribution, it is a series of bureaucratic work styles. Last year, the inspection during acquisition was not thorough, and new, old, good, and bad cotton seeds were mixed together. Storage was also not taken care of, ignoring the heavy autumn rains and wet cotton seeds, and stacking them in large piles, resulting in dampness and mold. The leading organs did not properly inspect these situations. This spring, the testing at various extension stations showed that some seedling rates were only 30%, but they were not reported; others reported 50%, which was believed to be true and taken as a general standard, adopting the method of doubling the sowing rate and distributing it downwards. When sowing, they did not consult with experienced farmers and masses, and did not provide farmers with technical guidance that was tailored to the specific situation, taking into account the degree of mold and damage to cotton seeds in various places and the heavy rains and cool ground this spring. The result was, of course, very bad. Another example is the repair of the Xu, Bao, and Han three-canal water conservancy project in Hanzhong. The budget was huge, the report was untrue, and the Water Conservancy Department approved the appropriation without proper review. However, the Planning Bureau discovered loopholes and sent people to conduct on-site investigations, only to find out that the original budget of 4.5 million catties of wheat was actually only enough for at most 2.2 million catties; the dam foundation of the Xuhui Canal was not solid, and new cracks appeared just after it was repaired; and there were many malpractices in contracting, factional struggles, and other aspects of the project. There are many similar events, which show that some old technical personnel are still using the old work styles and methods from the Kuomintang era to treat our work. They do not combine technology with politics and the masses, but are detached from politics, self-righteous, and look down on the masses, which inevitably makes technology detached from reality and become worthless, and the work cannot be done well. Our veteran cadres who are responsible for leadership, due to their lack of knowledge, being laymen, and not familiar with the business, blindly worship the old technical personnel, and their minds are captured by them, resulting in things being ruined. In order to overcome this phenomenon, we must work hard to learn, eliminate our backwardness and ignorance as soon as possible, become familiar with our own business, gradually change from laymen to experts, and assume full leadership responsibility. For the old technical personnel, we must unite with them and learn from them. There is nothing wrong with this, and we must continue to do so in the future. But so-called learning refers to using the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method to study and absorb the specific knowledge that others have and we lack. At no time and in no matter should we blindly worship without analysis or criticism. At the same time, it is even more important to be responsible for helping the old technical personnel transform their thinking and guide them onto the correct path of combining with politics and the masses.

    Let's also look at the grain issue. Recently, the Ministry of Finance carefully inspected the public grain situation in the Shaanxi Central area, revealing that our understanding of the situation was inaccurate, which is extremely alarming. According to reports from various places in Shaanxi Central at the end of last year, it was calculated that there would be a shortage of grain for seven months until the summer grain collection this year. A check in February this year showed that there were three more months of grain, but there was still a shortage of four months. Another check in March showed that there would be enough until the summer grain collection. After the recent Northwest Financial and Economic Work Conference, fearing that the stored grain would become moldy, the areas were ordered to report truthfully, and the result was that there was enough to eat until the end of July, with a surplus of more than 400,000 shi. This is how serious bureaucracy is! Due to this inaccurate understanding of the situation, it greatly affected our work in controlling the market and allocating materials. Last winter, due to the overestimation of the degree of grain shortage, public and private hoarding of grain was formed, and grain prices soared. We even requested the Central People's Government to transport 20 million catties of wheat from Henan. After prices stabilized this spring, a large amount of stored grain was released, which again led to a sharp drop in grain prices. To this day, Xi'an is still the basin of grain prices in major cities across the country. These are all difficulties that we have aggravated ourselves due to our own mistakes. Comrades engaged in financial work often show the erroneous view of "only caring about numbers, not asking about policies"; but their numbers are still so unreliable. It cannot be blamed on a lack of knowledge, but on a lack of responsibility for the people's cause, that is, a lack of strong Party spirit. Not going deep into the lower levels, not contacting reality, only asking the lower levels for reports, relying on reports to understand the situation, and then relying on reports to issue instructions and decisions to arrange work without regard to whether these reports and instructions and decisions conform to the facts, this will ruin our cause and turn leadership work into empty talk on paper.

    Why are reports unreliable? This is because there are still many people in our Party who tell lies. These can be divided into two types of people: one is the person who specializes in reporting "bad news." They often sigh and complain to the superiors, saying that there are many difficulties, for fear of increasing their burden. The grain problem is one example. The other type of person specializes in reporting "good news." They think everything is easy, love to boast, and indulge in blind optimism. Seeing the "good news" from below, they believe it to be true and quickly report it; seeing the "bad news" from below, they express doubt and suppress it.

    Here is a typical example of the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Trade Department, which ruined things by only listening to good news. Since September last year, the trade company has purchased more than 5.7 million catties of grain and more than 400,000 catties of cotton in various parts of Guanzhong to supply the market and regulate prices. However, after a thorough inspection recently, it was discovered that this huge reserve of materials was mostly just words on paper, an empty shell. The money was paid out, but the goods were not fully collected, and there were various malpractices. If they had not blindly believed the reports from below, how could this situation have been hidden for half a year?

    To overcome this bureaucratic style of empty talk on paper, we must first not listen to lies and not close the door to do leadership work in the office. Especially in the current situation, only a portion of the responsible personnel of the leading organs at all levels need to stay at home to preside over daily affairs; a portion of the personnel (even the majority) must frequently take turns going down to the lower levels, to the county, district, and township levels, to factories and schools, to carefully inspect the implementation of work, go deep into the masses, study reality, and help the lower levels discover and solve problems. Doing this and making it a system will eliminate the market for those who tell lies and change their practices. This is of great benefit to our cause and to the cadres themselves.

    We must especially mention this type of person: he has a long history of struggle, and the work he does is not unprofessional; it cannot be said that he is incompetent; he cannot sit still in the office, and he is often not at home all day. He often goes to the masses to ask questions, make reports, give speeches, and solve problems. It would be unfair to say that he is an empty talker. He is extremely busy all day long, but the work is indeed not done well. What is the problem? It is that he is not good at using his own strength. He is cautious and meticulous, does not trust others, manages everything, and likes to be a busy monk in a temple, getting up every day to open and close doors, sweep the floor, fetch water, boil tea, cook food, knock on the chime, strike the bell, send off and welcome people, worship the Buddha, and chant scriptures, busy all the time. Such staff members consume their limited energy on dealing with trivial matters, the work cannot be promoted, progress is very slow, and they are increasingly unable to keep up with the development of objective things. There are really too many such hard-working bureaucrats. We must know that leadership work is an art, and enthusiasm alone is definitely not enough. We must also have methods. Like fighting a war, bravery alone is not enough; we must pay attention to strategy and tactics. We must learn to concentrate our strength to solve the most important problems in the current work. There can only be one center in each period. In order to grasp this center, we must put aside and relax some other things. As long as we truly grasp this central problem and solve it thoroughly, other secondary problems will also be solved incidentally, or create conditions that are easy to solve. At the same time, we must be good at organizing the collective strength of all staff members to make our work department a complete set of smoothly coordinated machines. Only in this way can the work continue to progress.

    There are also some people whose bureaucratic atmosphere is extremely strong. The work he does cannot be questioned by others, the wall is very thick, and it is sacred and inviolable. Upon hearing criticism, he becomes fierce and rejects people from a thousand miles away. Or he specializes in boasting, being self-clever, and being satisfied with the formality of a vigorous appearance, without seeking the actual effect of the work. They all use the appearance of swift and decisive action to cover up the essence of disorganized and undisciplined bad thoughts, ruining many things without even knowing it. For example, the United Front Work Department of the Northwest Bureau recently collected some opinions on taxation and sent a comrade to the Northwest District Tax Bureau to check the facts and see if there were any discrepancies. However, a certain person in charge of the bureau put on a bureaucratic show for this comrade, criticized him haphazardly, and sent the comrade back. Just imagine: if such staff members are so rude to the Communist Party cadres, how dare the masses come to the door? Another example is the Xi'an branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration of the Longhai Railway, where many serious problems have occurred in the work, but the Party organization there never reports or asks the Northwest Bureau for instructions. They launched the "Donation of Transportation Equipment" movement, the "Three Assessments" movement, etc., and many serious mistakes occurred, some of which are simply outrageous! For these comrades, we must first help them get rid of the bad ideas of anarchism and indiscipline, and then we can talk about helping them change their bureaucratic work style.

    There are indeed not many purely "full-fed all day, doing nothing" bureaucrats, because everyone is busy working, and the environment is very unfavorable for this type of person. But this group of ideological lazybones is not non-existent. They are consistently passive in their work, "striking the bell as a monk for a day." "Not seeking merit, but seeking no fault," acting according to established rules, following precedents, not pushing, not moving, and even not moving when pushed, in short, they have never proactively done the things that should be done. They are reluctant to part with the old and decadent things; they keep fresh and beneficial opinions out of the door to avoid trouble; and they have the greatest tolerance for various bad phenomena. Their relationship with comrades is "I will not offend others unless they offend me." They adopt a "nice guy" attitude towards any major disputes within the Party. But they often plan their own private affairs very carefully. It is not difficult to imagine that the work under their leadership is extremely bad. This kind of ideological lazybones should never be forgotten in the anti-bureaucracy struggle. We must help them open their minds, start their machines, study hard, correct their mistakes, and move forward; otherwise, they will fall from their leadership positions.

    The above are some of the main manifestations of the bureaucratic work style in our leadership work. As for the commandist work style in the execution of work below, it is even more widespread. Grain collection and taxation were the first large-scale mass mobilization work after we entered the new area. The task has been largely completed, but there are many shortcomings and mistakes. The masses have many criticisms of the staff, the most important of which is the coercive command style. Cadres do not do in-depth publicity and explanation work, but rely on simple orders. A few people divide up the numbers without letting everyone speak and without listening to opinions from all sides. Meetings are also a formality, only allowing people to agree with the opinions of the cadres and not allowing opposition. Without real democracy, malpractices will occur, such as favoritism, protecting relatives and friends, squeezing the big households, and creating a phenomenon of uneven burdens. In urban areas, tax collection procedures only consider the convenience of the staff, regardless of the inconvenience of the masses. Taxes collected quarterly must be paid at once. Goods must be waited for for several days to be inspected. Even worse, they use methods such as beating, scolding, punishing, threatening, and detaining to promote work, which is absolutely wrong. We must know that no staff member other than the public security and judicial organs has the power to arrest people, except for criminals caught in the act. In particular, district and township governments and tax collection organs absolutely do not have the power to arrest people for collecting grain and taxes. Bad elements who truly sabotage grain collection and tax collection work can be sued and sentenced by the judicial organs. People who are punished in accordance with tax regulations should be the very few who deliberately resist the tax burden, not those who have not done their job well, still have doubts, or really have practical difficulties. Xi'an City punished 800 industrial and commercial households and 1,100 bicycle owners, which is obviously a big mistake. The reason for these phenomena is that when we took over the broken household chores left by the Kuomintang, many retained personnel brought over the bad bureaucratic habits and Baojia style; some veteran cadres and new students were also infected by this style. The masses criticize us for saying: "There is too little publicity about policies!" Very true. In the new areas, it is very necessary to hold more prepared mass meetings, combine the arrangement of work, and explain various specific policies. In fact, many staff members themselves are confused about the policies. The fundamental difference between our tax collection and the Kuomintang's tax collection is that we "take from the people and use for the people," while the Kuomintang "takes from the people and uses for themselves." In form, we are also asking the people for things, but the purpose is to do some big things for the people, to do big things to develop production and prosper the economy, for the long-term interests of the people. Our tax policy is fair and reasonable, and our grain collection and tax collection can gain the conscious support of the masses. Many staff members do not understand these principles, and their minds are filled with old ideas: "It is impossible to ask the masses for things without coercion," "Three good words are not as good as one horse whip." Of course, we cannot completely blame the lower levels. The leading organs have not done a good job of educating them. The tasks are urged tightly, and the policies have not been explained clearly, which is the responsibility.

    Indeed, attention has been paid to leading the masses in production. From many specific measures in various places, it has truly been done to center on production and carry out all work around the production task. But the working method is still mostly commandism. There is a farmer in Huayin County who did not plant the cotton seeds issued by the government, but planted his own cotton seeds (which actually sprouted better than the cotton seeds issued by the government). The cadre, on the pretext that he did not use improved varieties, forced him to shovel up the cotton seedlings and punished him for not being allowed to plant cotton for one year. This is really outrageous. In a certain place in Baoji, in order to prevent livestock plague, they ordered the masses to register the number of chickens and pigs, which caused bad people to spread rumors saying: "There is a tax on raising chickens, and stamps are affixed to eggs." In the Guanzhong counties, there is a lot of formalism in organizing labor. For example, a certain township in Weinan has a total of eleven types of production organizations: labor exchange teams, labor selling teams, firewood chopping groups, mutual aid groups, textile groups, straw hat weaving groups, cold noodle selling groups, zongzi selling groups, tofu selling groups, steamed bun selling groups, and egg collecting groups, which at first glance are formalism. Some cadres do not understand the actual situation, do not understand the countryside, have no production knowledge, and are confused themselves, and want to confuse the masses as well. Some cadres do not consider the level of awareness of the masses, and they run too far ahead, mistakenly recognizing what they understand as what the masses understand. They do not know that the peasants are the most practical, and they will only believe everything after they have personally experienced it. The current technical improvements and the future collectivization must be promoted gradually after in-depth publicity and typical demonstration. Any impatience or simple methods are bound to fail.

    In order to overcome the serious commandist work style in mass work, it is necessary to universally implement cadre training, transform thinking, strengthen specific guidance in work, and conduct long-term and continuous education work.

    In the specific work environment of the past year, some of the above-mentioned bad phenomena of being detached from reality and detached from the masses could have been avoided, and some were difficult to avoid. Because more than 90% of our staff members have newly joined the work and have not been well-educated and transformed; a small number of veteran cadres have found it difficult to quickly integrate with the broad masses of people in various places, so it is inevitable that the above-mentioned bad phenomena have occurred to a greater or lesser extent. The problem is that these phenomena absolutely cannot represent our Party's line and policies, absolutely cannot represent our Party's thinking and work style, but are shortcomings in the forward development of our revolutionary cause that need to be opposed and overcome. Now is the time to raise the vigilance of the entire Party! We already have all the necessary conditions to start eliminating these phenomena! And it can't be delayed any longer!

    III. Overcoming Shortcomings and Moving Towards a Victorious Future.

    Do we have the confidence to overcome the shortcomings in our work? We do.

    First, we have the strong leadership of the Party. The Party Central Committee has made a decision to rectify the thinking and work style of cadres. The Northwest Bureau has made specific plans to launch a movement to rectify the thinking and work style of cadres. That is to say, our Party has raised its vigilance in a timely manner. The main content of this rectification of thinking and work style is to oppose bureaucracy in leadership work and commandism in the execution of work. We must first overcome bureaucracy in leadership in order to effectively correct commandism below. The two must be combined with each other. Our movement to oppose bureaucracy and comprehensively inspect work has already begun. Opposing bureaucracy and commandism should not be detached from the past opposition to unhealthy tendencies, but should deal with the events that have been exposed in the past one by one in a concrete manner, guide the masses to carry out comprehensive inspection work; at the same time, in the struggle against bureaucracy and commandism, further expose corruption, extravagance and waste, illegal and undisciplined phenomena, and thoroughly correct them.

    Second, we have the weapons of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We have selected some documents and, through studying the documents, educated the vast number of new and veteran cadres to rapidly improve their ideological awareness, use democratic methods to educate and transform themselves, discard those thoughts, views, and methods that are not suitable for the interests of the people, discard the bad habits and bad thoughts from the old society, and establish a correct leadership work style and work style. To combine the study of documents with reality, we must carry out criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom and from bottom to top. It is very important for the Party's leading cadres to criticize their own work. This makes it easy to hit the key point and promote the overall situation. But the eyes of a few people are limited. We must listen to the criticisms of those below who are led. They can reflect richer and more vivid facts and offer many useful opinions. It's like opening a window to let in sunlight and breathe fresh air. We are in great need of sunlight and fresh air.

    Third, we have the cooperation of the broad masses of the people. There has been great progress within and outside the Party in the past year, and the political enthusiasm of the people of all classes has been greatly enhanced. They dare to criticize our shortcomings and ask us to improve, which is an excellent phenomenon. We must adopt a warm and welcoming attitude towards the criticism of the masses. Through newspapers, representative conferences of all sectors, and various mass representative conferences, attract the broad masses, especially the working people, to inspect and supervise our work. In the movement to rectify thinking and work style, actively absorb non-Party cadres and democratic figures to participate, listen to their opinions, and help them study, make common progress, and do a good job in the people's cause.

    Fourth, we have gained many new working experiences. Whether in united front work, ethnic unity, restoration of production, democratic reform, etc., we have many good examples in our work. These examples are all permeated with the working method of the mass line, full of creative activities, truly representing our Party's line and policies, truly representing our Party's thinking and work style, and truly manifesting the bright future of the people's revolutionary cause moving forward. We must be good at discovering these examples, summarizing experience, and educating the whole Party, so that they become a model for improving thinking and work style. With the development and deepening of the movement against bureaucracy and commandism, these good experiences and correct thinking and work style will be promoted and gradually popularized in all our work.

    The fundamental difference between us and the Kuomintang is that the Kuomintang represents a declining and reactionary class. It is itself a decaying body, and the sores on its body are incurable, only festering and expanding until death. We represent the interests of the working class and the entire people. We are a healthy body. We have problems and sores, but they are relatively minor, and they are transmitted from the outside world (the Kuomintang, the old society), and they are easy to treat. Everyone knows that our Communist Party has developed and grown stronger by constantly overcoming its shortcomings and mistakes. Normal ideological struggle within the Party is the driving force for promoting our Party's progress. Every large-scale ideological struggle or learning movement will inevitably make us stronger.

    Comrades! As long as we earnestly launch the movement to rectify the thinking and work style of cadres and cure the diseases of bureaucracy and commandism, we can unite more closely with the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the entire Northwest, increase our strength countless times, and have the guarantee to do the current work well. I hope that comrades will give these opinions serious consideration. If everyone agrees, we will act together in unity. [Xinhua News Agency]

　　反对官僚主义、命令主义
    中共中央西北局第二书记习仲勋在一九五○年五月二十日干部大会上的报告
    同志们：今天是西安解放的周年纪念日，正当今天，我们来回忆一年来的工作，分析情况，指出存在的问题，研究解决的办法，提起全党同志注意，是有意义的。今天要讲的，就是反对我们工作中官僚主义、命令主义的思想作风。
    一、我们工作中最大的危险
    自去年进入新区以来，我们的工作情况究竟起了什么变化？这首先是我们取得了伟大的胜利：解放了西北五省，建立了各级人民政权，并开始进行各项工作。这个胜利的到来，是迅速的，顺利的。但这个迅速、顺利到来的伟大胜利，也有其另一个方面：这就是我们的工作任务非常繁重，而领导进行这些工作的主观力量却不够坚强。我们地方工作中，新干部占百分之九十以上，还没有来得及进行教育和改造，其中很多人仍在用国民党时期的旧作风、旧办法来对待工作；老干部数量很少，又大部分不善于掌握新区情况，许多人在胜利情况下生长着骄傲情绪，以至沾染各种非无产阶级的思想。这样就使我们领导的机关中发展了各种形态的官僚主义作风，下边执行工作的机关发展了严重的命令主义作风（也是官僚主义的一种表现形态），其结果，当然是损害了我们党与人民群众的紧密联系。这就成为我们工作中最大的危险。
    自三月间，彭主席号召反对贪污腐化、铺张浪费、本位主义等不良倾向后，两月多以来，此间党、政、军、民各机关、团体、单位均开展了群众性的反不良倾向运动。各省各地也都积极响应。凡是在这个运动已经开展起来的地方，都有很大成绩，贪污腐化、违法乱纪的行为受到法律制裁，铺张浪费显著减少，干部和群众受到了教育，工作开始改进。而最重要的，是从一般的反不良倾向，进到深入检查各专业部门、企业单位的领导工作，这才打中了要害，照到了我们工作中阴影方面的最深处。无数活生生的事实证明：使各种不良倾向（贪污腐化，违法乱纪，铺张浪费等）能够存在和发展的，是领导工作中的官僚主义。使国家财产，公私经济（公私企业，群众生产），蒙受重大损失的，是领导机关的官僚主义和下边执行工作中的命令主义。这已经可以看得很清楚了。
    我们当前的任务，就是领导群众将反不良倾向运动，继续普遍地开展起来，深入下去，并引导运动向着开展全面检查工作，反对官僚主义、命令主义的方向走去。有两种偏向，要注意防止和纠正：一种是领导者对反不良倾向采取官僚主义态度，对群众运动不作研究，不加引导，将已经揭发出来的事件，搁置起来，不去经过处理这些具体事件教育和提高群众，并吸取群众的意见，改进工作。有的甚至将“反铺张”作为拒绝改进工作的挡箭牌，使下边感到“不顶事”，“没办法”，消沉下去。一种是群众带着平均主义和极端民主化的情绪，无休止地追求生活细节。这样会使运动迷失方向，使群众看不见前途，对工作没有好处。正确的原则，是按实际情况办事，凡非必办的事，那怕是花一个钱，也是浪费；而必须办的事，即使花百万千万，也是应当的。所以在群众运动发展过程中，必须密切注视群众思想动态，掌握方向，引导群众循着反官僚主义、命令主义的正确轨道前进，以达到联系群众，建立各项必须的工作制度，提高工作效率的目的。
    二、揭发官僚主义、命令主义
    官僚主义的特征，就是脱离实际、脱离群众。我们的事业之所以伟大，就是因为我们是忠心耿耿地为全体人民群众的利益奋斗。也只有动员千百万群众在我们领导下行动起来，我们才会有胜利，才能巩固自己的胜利。如果我们的思想作风不对头，让官僚主义、命令主义的政治微生菌将我们腐蚀起来，再不加警惕，不谋纠正，就会使我们的各项工作都办不好，就会丧失群众的爱戴，甚至会使群众离开我们，使已经获得的伟大胜利不能巩固，使我们遭受失败。
    可惜，我们领导工作中各种形态的官僚主义，正是很多很多的。
    看一看贷放优良棉种的问题吧！今年西北军政委员会农林部在关中地区贷放棉籽二百六十余万斤，共可播种十七万余亩，这是该部的一项重大工作，也是关系百万群众生活的重大事件。可是我们没有做好，大部分地区的苗出得很不好，最坏的只有一成苗，必须补种或翻种。据估计国家投资损失三十多亿，群众的损失更大，直接影响增产棉花的计划。人民政府在领导生产事业中的政治威信所受到的损失更是一项不可计算的损失。仔细研究一下这件事，可以说，从收购到储藏、试验、发放，都是一连串的官僚主义工作作风。去年收购时，检验不认真，将新、陈、好、坏掺杂不齐的棉籽收了进来。储藏又不注意，不顾秋雨多、棉籽湿，大堆积放，以致受潮发霉。这些情况，领导机关都没有好好检查过。今春各推广站试验，有的出苗率只有百分之三十，但不上报；有的报告百分之五十，便信以为真，作为一般标准，采取加倍播种方法，向下布置发放。播种时又不去和有经验的农民群众研究，针对各地储藏棉籽霉坏的程度，和今春雨多地凉等实况，给农民以切合具体情况的技术指导。结果当然是非常糟糕的。又如汉中整修湑、褒、汉三渠水利工程，预算庞大，报告不实，水利部没好好审查便批准拨款。但经计划局发现漏洞，派人实地调查，才查出：原预算四百五十万斤小麦，实际最多二百几十万斤即够；湑惠渠拦河大坝坝基不巩固，刚修起又发生新的裂缝；工程方面的包工剥削，派别斗争，弊端重重。类似的事件还很多，这些事件说明一些旧的技术人员仍然用国民党时代的旧作风、旧办法，来对待我们的工作。他们不是将技术与政治结合，与群众结合，而是脱离政治，自以为是，瞧不起群众，结果也就必然使技术脱离实际，成为无价值的东西，工作做不好。我们担负领导责任的老干部，由于自己的知识不足，外行，不熟悉业务，却又盲目地崇拜旧技术人员，思想上当了他们的俘虏，以致把事情弄坏。为要克服这种现象，就必须努力学习，尽快消灭自己的落后与无知，熟悉本身业务，逐渐地由外行变成内行、专门家，担负起全部领导责任。对于旧技术人员，我们要团结他们，向他们学习，这没有错误，今后还要这样做。但所谓学习，是指应用马列主义的立场、观点、方法，去研究、吸取别人所具有而自己所缺少的具体知识，任何时候，任何事情，都不应当不加分析、不加批判地盲目崇拜。同时，更重要的是要负责帮助旧技术人员改造思想，引导他们走上与政治结合、与群众结合的正确道路。
    再看看粮食问题。最近财政部认真检查了陕中地区的公粮状况，暴露出我们对情况了解的不确实，是极其惊人的。据去年年底陕中各地报告，计算下来，要吃到今年夏征，还差七个月吃粮。今年二月检查一次，多出三个月吃粮，还差四个月。三月份又检查一次，可以吃到夏征。最近西北财经工作会议后，因怕存粮发霉，责成各地实报，结果是吃到七月底，还余四十余万市石。这是何等严重的官僚主义！由于这种对情况了解不确实，就大大影响我们掌握市场，调配物资的工作。去冬因过分估计缺粮的程度，形成公私囤粮，粮价猛涨，还请求中央人民政府从河南运来两千万斤小麦。今春物价稳定后，大量存粮外吐，又形成粮价猛跌，至今西安还是全国各大城市中粮价的盆地，这都是自己的错误加重了自己的困难。搞财政工作的同志，常表现有“只管数字，不问政策”的错误观点；但他们的数字，还是这样的不可靠。就不能怪知识不够，而是对人民事业的负责精神不够，也就是党性不强。不深入下层，不接触实际，光向下边要报告，靠报告了解情况，又靠报告发指示、决定去布置工作而不管这些报告和指示决定是否符合事实，这样就弄坏了我们的事业，使领导工作变为纸上空谈。
    报告为什么不可靠？这因为我们党内说假话的人还多。这又可分为两种人：一种是专门报告“坏消息”的人，他们对上级常是唉声叹气，困难重重，生怕加重自己的负担，粮食问题即其一例。另一种人是专门报告“好消息”的，他们看一切事情都容易，爱放空炮，沉溺在盲目乐观的情绪中。看到下边的“好消息”，都信以为真，赶紧上报；看到下边的“坏消息”，则表示怀疑，压下不管。
    这样专门听好消息而弄坏事情的，可以举出西北军政委员会贸易部的典型例子。贸易公司从去年九月起，在关中各地采买粮食五百七十余万斤，棉花四十余万斤，本为供给市场，调节物价。但在最近切实检查了一下，才发现这一宗庞大的后备物资，原来多半是白纸黑字、空中楼阁，钱放出去，东西没有全部收回来，其中还有种种舞弊。如果不是迷信底下的报告，如何能让这种情况隐藏达半年之久呢？
    要克服这种纸上空谈的官僚主义，首先要不听假话，不要在办公室里关起门来做领导工作。特别在目前情况下，各级领导机关的负责人员，只须有一部分人在家主持日常事情就行了；必须有一部分人员（甚至是大部）经常轮流到下边去，到县上、区上、乡上去，到工厂、学校去，认真检查工作执行情况，深入群众，钻研实际，帮助下边发现问题，解决问题。这样做下去，并成为一种制度，说假话的人的货色，就没有市场了，就会改变作法。这对于我们的事业和干部本身，都是有很大益处的。
    我们特别要提到这样一种人；他有长久斗争历史，做的工作也并非外行，不可说他无能；他在办公室里也坐不住，甚至成天不在家，也常到群众中去问长问短，做报告，讲演，解决问题，说他是空谈家，也冤枉。他成天忙得要命，但工作确实没有做好。毛病在那里？在于不善于使用自己的力量。他谨小慎微，不放心别人，事事都管，爱做寺院里的忙和尚，每天起来，开门闭户，扫地打水，烧茶煮饭，敲罄撞钟，送往迎来，拜佛念经，忙个不停。这样的工作人员把有限的精力，消耗到应付事务细故中去，工作推不动，进步很慢，愈来愈赶不上客观事物的发展。这种辛辛苦苦的官僚主义者，实在是太多了。要知道领导工作是一种艺术，仅有热情，是绝对不够的，还要有办法。像打仗一样，光靠勇敢不行，要讲究战略、战术。要学会集中力量去解决当前工作中最重要的问题。每一时期只能有一个中心。为要抓住这个中心，就要将别的事情，丢开一些，放松一些。只要真正抓住这个中心问题，给以透彻解决，其他次要问题也会连带解决，或造成容易解决的条件。同时要善于组织全部工作人员的集体力量，使自己的工作部门成为一套完整的动作合拍的机器。这样才能使工作不断进步。
    还有一些人，官僚主义的气味极其浓厚。他做的工作别人不能过问，墙堵得很厚，神圣不可侵犯。一听到批评，就疾言厉色，拒人于千里之外。或是专爱自吹自擂，自作聪明，满足于形式上的轰轰烈烈，不求工作的实际效果。他们都是以雷厉风行的外表，掩盖无组织、无纪律恶劣思想的实质，把许多事情弄坏了，自己还不知道。如西北局统一战线工作部最近收集到一些税收方面的意见，派一位同志去西北区税务总局查对事实，看有无出入？但该局某负责人竟对这个同志大摆官僚架子，胡乱批评一顿，把这个同志碰回来了。试想：这样的工作人员对共产党的干部尚且如此蛮横，群众还敢上门吗？又如陇海路郑州管理局西安分局，工作中发生不少严重问题，但那里党的组织，从不向西北局报告和请示。他们所发动“献纳交通器材”运动，“三评”运动等等，都发生许多严重错误，有一些简直是令人非常愤慨的事情！对于这些同志，首先要帮助他们丢掉无政府、无纪律的恶劣思想，然后才可以谈得到去帮助他们改变官僚主义作风的问题。
    那种纯粹“饱食终日，无所用心”的官僚主义者，确实不多，因为大家都在忙着工作，环境对于这种人是很不利的。但这样一批标本的思想懒汉，并不是不存在的。他们对工作是一味消极，“当一天和尚撞一天钟”。“不求有功，但求无过”，等因奉此，照例行事，不推不动，甚至推也不动，总之是从来没有主动地办好应办的事情。他们对陈旧腐朽的东西，恋恋不舍；对新鲜有益的意见，关在门外，避免麻烦；对各种恶劣现象，能有最大的容忍。他们对同志间的关系，是“人不犯我，我不犯人”。对党内任何重大争论，都抱“好好先生”态度。而对自己私人的事情，却往往打算得很周到。不难想像，他们领导下的工作，是糟糕到极点的。对这种思想懒汉，在反官僚主义斗争中，决不应忘记。要帮助他们打开脑筋，开动机器，好好学习，改正错误，向前进步，否则他们是会从领导岗位上跌下来的。
    以上，就是我们领导工作中官僚主义作风的一些主要的表现形态。至于下边在执行工作中的命令主义作风，那就更其普遍了。征粮，收税，是我们进入新区后第一项大规模的群众动员工作，任务大体完成了，但缺点、错误很多，群众对工作人员有很多批评，最主要的就是强迫命令作风。干部不做深入宣传解释工作，靠简单命令行事，由少数人把数目分派好，不让大家讲话，不听取各方面的意见，开会也是形式，只许人家赞成干部的意见，不许反对。没有实际的民主，弊端也就发生了，要私情，包庇亲朋，挤大户，造成畸轻畸重现象。在城市中税收手续只顾工作人员便利，不管群众麻烦。按季征收的税款，要一次缴纳。验货要等几天。更恶劣的是用打骂、处罚、威胁、拘押等办法推动工作，这是绝对错误的。要知道：除现行犯外，公安、司法机关以外的任何工作人员没有捕人权。特别是区、乡政府，税收机关，绝对没有因催收粮款而逮捕人的权力。真正破坏征粮税收工作的坏分子，可以上告，由司法机关判处。依照税收条例规定给予处罚的人，应是那极少数故意违抗税款负担的分子，而不是因为工作没做到，尚有疑虑，或真有实际困难的人。西安市处罚了八百户工商业者，和一千一百辆自行车的持有者，显然是个很大的错误。产生这些现象的原因，是我们在接收国民党留下的破烂家务时，很多留用人员，将那种恶劣的官僚习气、保甲作风也带过来了；有些老干部，新学生也受了这种作风的传染。群众批评我们说：“宣传政策太少了！”很对。在新区多开些有准备的群众会议，结合布置工作，讲解各种具体政策，是非常需要的。其实，很多工作人员自己对于政策就糊里糊涂。我们的税收与国民党税收的根本区别：在于我们是“取之于民，用之于民”，而国民党是“取之于民，用之于己”。形式上我们也是向人民要东西，但目的是为人民办一些大事情，办发展生产、繁荣经济的大事，是为了人民的长远利益。我们的税收政策是公平合理的，我们的征粮、收税是能够获得群众自觉拥护的。这些道理，很多工作人员都不了解，脑子里装满了旧思想：“向群众要东西非强迫不可”，“三句好话不如一马棒”。当然也不能完全怪下边，领导机关没有好好向他们做教育工作，任务催的紧，政策没有讲清楚，是有责任的。
    领导群众生产，是确实注意了。从各地许多具体措施来看，都真正做到以生产为中心，一切工作围绕生产任务进行。但工作方法仍然是命令主义多。华阴县有一家农民，没有种政府发的棉籽，而种了自己的棉籽（实际比政府发的棉籽出苗好），干部借口他没有采用优良品种，强迫他铲掉棉苗，处罚一年不准种棉花。真是岂有此理。宝鸡某地为防治畜瘟，命令群众登记鸡、猪数目，引起坏人造谣说：“喂鸡出税，鸡蛋贴印花”。关中各县组织劳动力，有不少形式主义。如渭南某乡共有十一种生产组织：变工队、卖工队、打柴组、互助组、纺织组、编草帽组、卖凉粉组、卖粽子组、卖豆腐组、卖馍组、收鸡蛋组等，一看就知道是形式主义。有些干部是不懂实际，不懂农村，毫无生产知识，自己糊涂，还要把群众也弄糊涂。有些干部是不顾群众的觉悟水平，自己跑得太前了，把自己了解的东西误认识为群众也了解。不知道农民是最实际的，一切事情都要经过他们亲身体验才会相信。现在的技术改良，将来的集体化，都要经过深入宣传，典型示范，再逐步推广。任何急燥情绪，简单办法，都必定要失败的。
    为着克服群众工作中严重的命令主义作风，必须普遍实行干部整训，改造思想，加强工作中的具体指导，并进行长期不断的教育工作。
    在过去一年的具体工作环境中，上述种种脱离实际、脱离群众的恶劣现象，有些是可以避免的，有些则是很难避免的。因为我们的工作人员有百分之九十以上是新参加工作的，未经很好教育改造；少数老干部，很难迅速地与各地广大群众相结合，这样就难免或多或少的发生上述各种恶劣现象。问题在于：这些现象，绝对不能代表我们党的路线和政策，绝对不能代表我们党的思想和作风，而是我们革命事业前进发展中的缺点，是需要加以反对和克服的。现在到了提起全党警惕的时候了！我们已经有一切必要条件来着手清除这些现象了！而且不能再迟了！
    三、克服缺点，向胜利前途迈进。
    我们有无把握克服自己工作中的缺点呢？是有把握的。
    第一、有党的坚强领导。党中央已作了整顿干部思想作风的决定。西北局已经做出具体计划，要开展一个整顿干部思想作风的运动。这就是说，我们党已经及时地提起了警觉。这次整顿思想作风的主要内容，就是反对领导工作中的官僚主义和执行工作中的命令主义。必须首先克服领导上的官僚主义，才能有效地纠正底下的命令主义，二者要互相结合。我们这种反官僚主义的运动，全面检查工作，已经开始了。反对官僚主义、命令主义，不应与过去反不良倾向互相脱节，而是将过去已经揭发出来的事件，逐一具体处理，引导群众去开展全面检查工作；同时又在反对官僚主义、命令主义斗争中，更深入地揭发贪污腐化、铺张浪费、违法乱纪等等恶劣现象，加以彻底纠正。
    第二、我们有马列主义、毛泽东思想的武器。我们已经选定了一些文件，经过学习文件，教育广大新、老干部迅速提高思想觉悟，用民主的方法，教育改造自己，丢掉那些不适合人民利益的思想、观点和办法，丢掉从旧社会得来的坏习气、坏思想，建立起正确的领导作风和工作作风。要做到学习文件与实际结合，必须开展自上而下与自下而上相结合的批评与自我批评。党的领导干部批评自己的工作是很重要的，这容易击中要害，推动全局。但少数人的眼睛是有局限性的。必须听取下边被领导者的批评，他们能够反映更丰富的生动事实，能够提出很多有益的意见。好比打开窗子才可以放进阳光，呼吸到新鲜空气。我们是非常需要阳光和新鲜空气的。
    第三、有广大人民群众的合作。一年来党内、党外均有很大进步，各阶层人民群众的政治积极性已大大提高，敢于批评我们的缺点，要求我们改进，这是极好的现象。我们对群众的批评，要采取热诚欢迎的态度。经过报纸、各界代表会议、各种群众代表会议等等方式，吸引广大群众、特别是劳动人民来检查和监督我们的工作。在整顿思想作风运动中，积极吸收非党干部和民主人士参加，倾听他们的意见，又帮助他们学习，共同进步，办好人民的事业。
    第四、我们已经取得许多新的工作经验。无论在统一战线、民族团结、恢复生产、民主改革等等方面，我们工作中都有许多好的范例。这些范例，都是贯串着群众路线的工作方法，充满创造性的活动，真正代表着我们党的路线和政策，真正代表着我们党的思想和作风，也是真正表现了人民革命事业向前发展的光明前途的。我们要善于发现这些范例，总结经验，教育全党，使成为改进思想作风的榜样。随着反官僚主义、命令主义运动的开展和深入，将这些好的经验，正确的思想作风，推广开来，逐步地普及到我们的全部工作中去。
    我们和国民党根本不同之处，就在于国民党是代表没落的反动的阶级，它本身就是一具腐朽的肌体，它身上长的脓疮是不可救药的，只有溃烂扩展，直到死亡。我们则是代表工人阶级和全体人民群众的利益，本身是个健康的肌体，我们有毛病，也有脓疮，但这是比较轻微的，而且是外界（国民党、旧社会）传染来的，是容易治疗的。大家知道：我们共产党就是在不断克服自己的缺点、错误中发展壮大起来的。党内正常思想斗争是推动我们党前进的动力。每一次大规模的思想斗争或学习运动，都必然会使我们更加坚强起来。
    同志们！只要我们认真开展整顿干部思想作风的运动，治好官僚主义、命令主义的病害，我们就可以和全西北各族、各界人民更进一步的团结起来，增加无数倍的力量，有保证地做好当前要做的工作。这些意见，希望同志们好好考虑一番，如果大家都同意，我们就一致行动起来。【新华社讯】
