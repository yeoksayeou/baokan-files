　　Permanent Repair Project for Major Zheng Bridges on the Jinpu Railway Line at Huai River and Mingguang Largely Completed
    Great Efforts Underway to Overcome Enormous Difficulties in Cleaning Bridge Piers
    [Our newspaper's Bengbu dispatch] The permanent repair project for the major Zheng bridges on the Jinpu South Section between Bengbu and Pukou, namely the Huai River and Mingguang bridges, is currently being actively carried out. As of early May, the work of salvaging, lifting, and riveting steel beams for these two major Zheng bridges has been basically completed; the work of cleaning and joining cement piers has also been mostly completed. Before our army liberated Bengbu in January of last year, these two major bridges were blown up by the Kuomintang bandit troops. The five middle spans of the Huai River Bridge were blown into the water, and three bridge piers were destroyed; the entire bridge of the Mingguang Bridge was blown into the water, and six bridge piers were also toppled. In order to ensure traffic on this line during the rainy season, the Ministry of Railways instructed the Jinan Railway Administration to organize the Bridge Engineering Department to start the permanent construction of these two major Zheng bridges in November of last winter. Before the start of construction, Soviet expert Kingolink personally went to inspect and introduced advanced Soviet science and technology, which solved many practical difficulties in the project. For example, the methods of using "wooden caissons to build wooden piers" and "I-beam to support the bridge" were adopted to salvage the steel beams that were sunk in the water, saving a large amount of steel materials. During the construction process, many difficulties continued to be encountered. In February and April, there were two spring floods that had not been seen in nearly 20 years, with the water level rising two or three meters; many discarded steel materials left by the Japanese invaders when they repaired the two Zheng bridges in 1939 also became obstacles to underwater work. In order to overcome these difficulties, the workers gave full play to the collective wisdom of the working class and created working methods such as "floating target threading" and "aerial beam alignment," allowing the fourth span of the Huai River Bridge, which was the most difficult to salvage, to emerge from the water; and various steel bridge structures could be spliced ​​together in the air six or seven zhang above the water surface. At present, the biggest difficulty in the project is the cleaning work of piers No. 3 and 5 of the Huai River Bridge and pier No. 5 of the Mingguang Bridge. In particular, the cleaning work of pier No. 5 of the Huai River Bridge, because when the Japanese invaders repaired the bridge in the spring of 1939, in order to rush to open the traffic, the bad foundation underneath was not thoroughly cleaned, and cement was added on top of it, and there were a large number of cement blocks and waste steel materials that had sunk to the bottom of the river around it. Now, when reconstructing the cement pier, the iron cofferdam cannot reach the bottom, the water flow cannot be pumped dry, and the cleaning work is seriously hindered. In addition to continuing to use divers to salvage cement blocks, the Bridge Engineering Department has also made various preparations and will use "pneumatic caissons" when necessary to ensure the rapid completion of the permanent repair project of the Huai River Bridge.

　　津浦线淮河、明光两大正桥
    永久修复工程大部竣工 
    现正克服巨大困难清理桥墩
    【本报蚌埠讯】津浦南段蚌埠至浦口间的淮河。明光两大正桥的永久修复工程，现正积极进行中。截至五月上旬，该两大正桥的打捞、起重、拚铆钢梁的工作，基本上已经完成；清理与接打洋灰墩工作，亦已完成大半。去年一月我军解放蚌埠前，该两大桥梁为国民党匪军所炸坏。淮河桥中间五孔被炸落水，三个桥墩被炸毁；明光桥桥梁全部被炸落水中，六个桥墩亦被炸倒。为确保该线雨季交通，铁道部责成济南铁路管理局，组织桥梁工程处，于去冬十一月开始，修建该两大正桥的永久工程。开工前，苏联专家金果林克曾亲往勘察，并介绍了苏联的先进科学技术，解决了工程中很多实际困难。如采用“木沈箱打道木垛”和“工字梁顶桥”的方法，打捞炸沉在水中的钢梁，节省下大批的钢料。在施工过程中，继续遇到许多困难。二、四两月间，先后两次暴发了近二十年来未曾有过的春季洪汛，水位上涨两三公尺；日寇在一九三九年修复该两正桥时，曾遗弃许多废钢料，此时也成水下工作的障碍。为了克服这些困难，职工们发扬了工人阶级的集体智慧，创造了“浮标穿针”、“空中对梁”等工作方法，使最难打捞的淮河第四孔梁脱出水面；并可在距水面六七丈高的空中拚对各种钢材桥梁。目前工程中最大的困难，是淮河桥三、五号墩及明光桥五号墩的清理工作。特别是淮河桥第五号墩的清理工作，因为日寇在一九三九年春修复该桥时，为了急于通车，对下边的坏基础未彻底清理，就在上面接打洋灰，其周围并有大量的洋灰块和沉陷到河底的废钢料。现在改筑洋灰墩时，铁围堰下不到底，水流抽不干，清理工作受到严重障碍。现桥梁工程处除继续利用潜水员打捞洋灰块外，并作了各种准备工作，必要时将使用“压气沈箱”。以使淮河桥的永久修复工程迅速竣工。（吕光明）
