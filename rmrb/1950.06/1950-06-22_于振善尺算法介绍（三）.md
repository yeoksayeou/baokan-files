Introduction to Yu Zhenshan's Slide Rule Algorithm (3)
    Oblong Slide Rule Calculator – Cutting and straightening either the celestial or terrestrial ruler of a circular slide rule calculator will create an oblong slide rule calculator. There is no need to calculate the hypotenuse because it is created by the oblique division standard. The usage and principles of these three types of slide rule calculators (square, circular, and oblong) are the same. The square one can calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, oblique division, and dividing the oblique. The celestial ruler of the circular and oblong ones loses the function of oblique division, and the terrestrial ruler also loses the function of averaging because they are not equally divided and cannot calculate addition and subtraction. However, it is very convenient to use them for multiplication and division, and they are also easy to carry; moreover, they can calculate trigonometric functions, logarithms, weights and measures, etc., but various calculation scales must be added to the celestial and terrestrial rulers. The square slide rule calculator has achieved success by adding a reciprocal scale, which not only solves problems involving combined addition and subtraction, combined multiplication and division, exponentiation, root extraction, logarithms, and functions all at once, but also solves partial trigonometric function problems, partial binary quadratic simultaneous equations in algebra, and partial plane geometry and triangle area calculation problems, just by slanting the ruler to find the answer.
  I. Addition
    Augend + Addend = Sum
    Ruler Used: Two rulers with identical scales; one is called the celestial ruler, and the other is called the terrestrial ruler.
    Method:
    (1) Align the 0 on the celestial ruler with the augend (or addend) on the terrestrial ruler.
    (2) The number on the terrestrial ruler that is aligned with the addend (or augend) on the celestial ruler is the sum.
    [Example]: A comrade has 50 yuan and receives another 30 yuan. How much money does he have in total?
    Method: As shown in Figure 6.
    (1) Align the 0 on the celestial ruler with the 3 on the terrestrial ruler (representing 30 yuan).
    (2) The 5 on the celestial ruler (representing 50 yuan) aligns with the 8 on the terrestrial ruler, which is the sum (representing 80 yuan).
    (Note) Here, as long as the two rulers are aligned, the 1, 2, 3, 4... on the celestial ruler align with 4, 5, 6, 7... on the terrestrial ruler, representing 3 + 1 = 4, 3 + 2 = 5, 3 + 3 = 6, 3 + 4 = 7...

　　于振善尺算法介绍（三）
    长形尺算器——将圆形尺算器的天地二尺的任何一尺截开、拉直，即可变成长形尺算器。不用去斜，因它是斜分标准造成的。这三种（方形、圆形、长形）尺算器使用法及道理都是一样。方形的能算加、减、乘、除、斜分、分斜。圆形及长形的天尺失去了斜分作用，地尺也失去了平分作用，因为它们不是等分的，也不能算加减。但用它来乘除就很便利，携带也方便；更能计算三角函数、对数、斤两等，但须在天地尺上添上各种计算数目的刻度。方形尺算器添上倒数尺获得了成功，不但把加减连算及乘除连算、乘方、开方、对数、函数混在一起的问题，一次求出；而且对于部分的三角函数问题、代数上部分二元二次联立方程式、部分的平面几何和三角形截亩等问题，只要把尺子一斜即可求出他的得数来。
  一、加法
    被加数＋加数＝和
    用尺：用两根刻度相同的尺子；一叫天尺，一叫地尺。
    求法：
    （１）把天尺上的０对准地尺上的被加数（或加数）。
    （２）天尺上的加数（或被加数）所对着的地尺上的数即是所求的和。
    【例题】：某同志有５０元，又收入３０元，问共有多少元？
    求法：如第六图所示。
    （１）把天尺上的０对准地尺上的３（代表３０元）。
    （２）天尺上的５（代表５０元）所对着的地尺上的８即所求的和（代表８０元）。
    （注）在这里只要把两条尺对准，天尺上的１、２、３、４……，分别对着地尺上的４、５、６、７……，就代表３＋１＝４，３＋２＝５，３＋３＝６，３＋４＝７……。
