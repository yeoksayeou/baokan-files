Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 28th. The People's Government is now actively assisting fishermen in the Zhoushan Islands to prepare to go to sea for fishing, revitalizing the fishing industry that was severely devastated by the Kuomintang remnants.

　　The Zhoushan Islands are one of the three major fishing grounds in the Far East. Shenjiamen on the southeastern coast of the islands, and Daishan and Jieshan Islands are the three major fish markets in the Zhoushan Islands. In the past, during the peak period, there were four fishing seasons each year, with a total of more than 12,000 ocean-going fishing boats, employing more than 60,000 people directly engaged in fishing, and an annual output of more than 2 million dan of fish. The yellow croaker, cuttlefish, jellyfish, and other products were sold well in the southeastern provinces, and a large number of fishery products were salted and sold to various parts of Southeast Asia every year.

　　Before liberation, the fishing industry in the Zhoushan Islands was already declining due to imperialist aggression against China's fishing rights and the brutal exploitation by the Kuomintang bandits. In April last year, when Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces were liberated, the fishing industry suffered even more severe devastation after the remnants of the bandits窜踞 [cuan ju - fled into and occupied] the islands. In addition to levying military supplementary fees, fishing taxes, port donations, pacification fees, passport fees, and daily fresh fish payments from the fishermen, the bandit army also implemented "boat closures" and "port closures." A large number of fishing boats were concentrated and detained on the islands by the Kuomintang bandit army. The fishing boats that were fortunately allowed to go to sea could only fish in the offshore areas designated by the bandit army, and were not allowed to approach the shore, while the islands and shores were exactly where fish breed and inhabit. Many wooden boats could not withstand the impact of strong winds and waves when sailing offshore, and often returned empty. When the wind and waves were strong, the number of boats colliding with each other, resulting in the loss of both boats and people, was extremely large. During the spring fishing season this spring, the Shenjiamen fishing area only caught 15,000 dan of fish, a decrease of more than 81% compared with the spring fishing season last year. In the past, the annual output of jellyfish was 440,000 dan, but in the past year, it has been completely lost because the bandit army strictly prohibited fishing boats from going to sea at night.

　　Low-price unified purchase was another means for the remnants of the bandits to destroy the fishing industry. Before liberation, the remnants of the bandits plundered a large number of fishery products and transported them to Taiwan by exchanging one dan of rice for ten dan of fish in disguise. The fish price fell miserably to only one-tenth of the pre-war fish price. A large number of fishermen, boatmen, and employees of fishery firms and factories on the island lost their jobs, went bankrupt, and fell into a state of hunger and cold.

　　After the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands, the People's Government immediately organized working teams to investigate the fishing industry and actively assist fishermen in restoring production. Now that the fishing season is approaching, the liberated fishermen are full of hope and preparing to go to sea for fishing. In Shenjiamen alone, more than 220 fishing boats have registered with the working team. In addition, fishermen from Zhujiajian, Baishagang and other islands dispatched dozens of small boats to go to sea for fishing on the second day after liberation. Each boat can catch up to 400 to 500 jin of cuttlefish or more than 200 jin of yellow croaker per day. With the lifting of the maritime blockade and the active support of the People's Government, the restoration of the fishing industry in the Zhoushan Islands will be rapid and smooth.

### 远东三大渔场之一  舟山渔业开始恢复

　　远东三大渔场之一
    舟山渔业开始恢复
    【新华社杭州二十八日电】人民政府现正积极帮助舟山群岛渔民准备下海捕鱼，重振被国民党残匪严重摧残的渔业。
    舟山群岛为远东三大渔场之一。群岛东南岸上之沈家门和岱山、街山两岛为舟山群岛的三大渔市。过去极盛时期，每年鱼汛四期，放洋渔船本客帮共达一万二千余艘，直接从事捕鱼者共有六万余人，年产鱼二百余万担。所产黄鱼、墨鱼、海蜇等畅销东南诸省，每年并有大批渔产经咸制后运销南洋各地。
    解放前，舟山群岛渔业因帝国主义侵略我国渔权和国民党匪帮残酷剥削，本已日趋没落。去年四月，江浙等省解放，残匪窜踞群岛后，渔业受到了更加严重的摧残。匪军除了向渔民征收军用补充费、渔税、港口捐、绥靖费、护照费以及每天征收的鲜鱼代金费等等苛捐杂税以外，并实行“封船”、“封港”。大批渔船被国民党匪军集中封扣于岛上。侥幸被允许出海的渔船，也只能在匪军指定的远洋区域捕鱼，不得近岸，而岛岸恰是鱼类繁殖栖息之所。许多木船航行远洋，抵御不住大风浪的冲击，常常空船折回。风浪猛时，船只互撞以至船、人两亡者为数极多。沈家门渔区今春鱼汛时期，仅捕鱼一万五千担，较去年春汛期减少百分之八十一强。海蜇在往时年产四十四万担，一年来则因匪军严禁渔船晚间下海，已全部丧失。
    低价统制收购为残匪摧残渔业的另一手段。解放前，残匪以一担米换十担鱼的变相劫掠，搜括大批渔产，运往台湾。鱼价惨落到仅及战前鱼价的十分之一。岛上渔民、船手以及渔行渔厂的职工等大批地失业、破产，陷于饥寒交迫的困境。
    舟山群岛解放后，人民政府立即组织工作队调查渔业情况，积极协助渔民恢复生产。现鱼汛即届，获得解放后的渔民正满怀希望，准备下海捕鱼。沈家门一地前往工作队登记的已有二百二十多艘渔船。此外，朱家尖、白沙港诸岛渔民，在解放后第二天即出动数十艘小船下海捕鱼，每船每日最多可捕墨鱼四、五百斤或黄鱼二百多斤。随着海上封锁的解除，在人民政府积极扶植下，舟山群岛渔业的恢复将会是迅速和顺利的。
