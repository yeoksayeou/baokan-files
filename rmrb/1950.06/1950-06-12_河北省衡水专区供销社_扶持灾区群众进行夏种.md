　　Hengshui Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Hebei Province Supports Disaster Area Masses in Summer Planting
    [Our report from Hengshui] To support the masses in the disaster areas in carrying out summer sowing on time, the Hengshui Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Hebei Province signed a grain exchange contract with the Grain Company on May 28. The contract stipulates that the supply and marketing cooperative will exchange wheat for 500,000 jin of corn and 30,000 jin of mung beans from the Grain Company, and immediately exchange the corn and mung beans for the masses. After the wheat harvest, the supply and marketing cooperative will collect the wheat and exchange it for the Grain Company's corn and mung beans. Currently, the Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative is organizing manpower and animal power to transport this batch of seeds to Jing County and Fucheng, which are severely affected by the disaster, to solve the difficulties of summer seed in these two counties. At the same time, the Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative has recently transported 8 million jin of fertilizer (bean cake) from Tianjin, which has been specifically allocated to the counties to support the masses in summer planting and top dressing.

　　河北省衡水专区供销社  扶持灾区群众进行夏种
    【本报衡水讯】河北省衡水专区供销社为扶持灾区群众按时进行夏季播种，特于五月二十八日与粮食公司订立换粮合同。合同规定供销社以小麦与粮食公司交换玉米五十万斤，绿豆三万斤，并立即将玉米、绿豆换给群众，待麦收后经供销社收回小麦换给粮食公司。现专区供销社正组织人、畜力将这批种子运往灾情严重的景县、阜城。以解决该两县夏种种子的困难。同时，专区供销社又于最近从天津运到肥料（豆饼）八百万斤，已具体分配到县，以扶持群众夏种和上追肥。
