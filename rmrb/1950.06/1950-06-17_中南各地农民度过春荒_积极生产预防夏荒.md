[Hankou News] Yangtze River Daily News: Farmers in various parts of Central and Southern China are now actively producing to prevent the summer famine after overcoming the spring famine. Farmers in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan and other provinces have largely solved the difficulties of current life and production materials after rent reduction and refund, production self-rescue, government loans and loan assistance, and harvesting wheat and broad beans, but there is still a shortage of food in the summer. Yuan Renyuan, Deputy Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, after inspecting the disaster areas, estimated that the disaster victims in the severely affected areas still lacked 30 to 40 days of food, based on the small number of spring harvest crops in the severely affected areas. After Henan enters the wheat harvest season, the famine problem is generally easier to solve. However, due to excessive rainfall in Xinyang Prefecture, more than 30,000 mu of fields were flooded, and hail disasters occurred in areas such as Shanzhou and Luoyang, damaging some wheat fields, and wheat insect disasters occurred in areas such as Shangqiu and Nanyang. Therefore, the issue of preventing the summer famine cannot be ignored. The People's Governments of Henan and Guangdong provinces issued instructions on preventing summer disasters in late May. Many areas in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangxi and other provinces called on farmers to save food and eliminate wasteful habits such as eating "rice for planting seedlings" when transplanting rice seedlings. Nanxian County, Hunan Province, convened a meeting of district chiefs to specifically discuss methods for leading the masses to prevent the summer famine, and corrected the 麻痹 ideology of some cadres and the erroneous view of simply relying on government loans and relief through typical household surveys and detailed accounting methods. Cili, Changsha and other counties have also made specific arrangements for preventing the summer famine.
Currently, under the leadership of the local people's governments, the masses in various places are actively carrying out production to prevent the summer famine. In terms of planting early-maturing crops: the masses in Sanhekou District, Macheng, Hubei Province, are actively reclaiming wasteland for melon cultivation. Sanhe Village alone has planted 34,000 plants, which can be harvested before the rice harvest. The masses in the Beijiang District of Guangdong have reclaimed more than 10,000 mu of wasteland, and most of it has been planted with early-maturing crops. In terms of sideline production: six households of disaster victims in the Xie'an Township, Nanxian County, Hunan Province, are engaged in oil picking, spinning, and digging water chestnuts, and each person's daily income can maintain the lives of five or six people. In terms of free lending, many village cadres in various regions have taken the lead in lending surplus grain to poor farmers. At the same time, the savings movement is also being launched in various places. The anti-feudal re-examination of rent reduction work in various places can also be combined with the problem of solving the summer famine for poor farmers. For example, from April 28 to May 8, farmers in Puqi County, Hubei Province, reduced 60,546 dan of grain through re-examination of rent reduction; the masses in Si Village, Weidong Township, Shaoyang County, Hunan Province, continued to implement rent reduction, and have now found more than 100 dan of grain, which can also partially solve the problem of the summer famine.

　　中南各地农民度过春荒
    积极生产预防夏荒
    【汉口讯】长江日报消息：中南区各地农民在度过春荒后，现正积极生产预防夏荒。湖南、湖北、江西、河南等省农民，经过了减租退租、生产自救、政府贷粮贷款的扶助，以及收割麦子、蚕豆后，相当解决了当前生活和生产资料的困难，但仍存在着夏季缺粮问题。湖南省人民政府袁任远副主席视察灾区后，根据重灾区春收作物少的情况，估计全省灾民尚差三十天到四十天的口粮。河南进入麦收季节后，灾荒问题一般说来，较易解决。但信阳专区因雨水过多，淹田三万多亩，陕州、洛阳等地发生雹灾，部分麦田受损，商邱、南阳等地有麦虫灾害。因此防备夏荒问题，仍不容忽视。河南、广东两省人民政府曾在五月下旬先后发布了防备夏灾的指示。湖南、湖北、江西、广西等省不少地区在插秧时，即号召农民省吃俭用，废除吃“插秧饭”等浪费习惯。湖南南县召开了区长会议，具体讨论了领导群众预防夏荒的办法，并通过典型户调查与算细账方式，纠正部分干部的麻痹思想与单纯依靠政府贷粮救济的错误观点。慈利、长沙等县对预防夏荒亦已作具体布置。
    目前各地群众在当地人民政府领导下，正积极进行生产防备夏荒。在种早熟作物方面：湖北麻城三河口区群众，积极开荒种瓜，仅三河村已种了三万四千棵，可在收稻前收获。广东北江区群众开荒万余亩，多已种上早熟作物。在副业生产方面：湖南南县协安乡八保六户灾民进行挑油、纺纱、挖菱角，每人每天的收入可维持五、六人的生活。在自由借贷方面，不少地区村干部自动带头把多余的粮食借给贫苦农民。同时节约运动亦在各地展开。各地反封建的复查减租工作，亦可与贫苦农民解决夏荒问题结合。如湖北蒲圻县农民自四月二十八日至五月八日，经复查减租又减出谷子六万零五百四十六石；湖南邵阳县卫东乡四村群众继续贯彻减租，现已查出谷子一百多石，亦可部分解决夏荒问题。
