[This news dispatch comes from Jianghua, Hunan] The Yao people in the mountainous areas on the border of Hunan and Guangxi are gradually embarking on a new path of life under the leadership of the People's Government. There are 18,000 Yao people in Jianghua County, accounting for about one-tenth of the total population. Among them are three types: "Tu Yao" (native Yao), "Guoshan Yao" (mountain-crossing Yao), and "Dingban Yao" (top-board Yao) (formerly called "Dog-head Yao" by the ruling class). The first two types are more numerous. They mostly wrap their heads in cloth, wear short earth-cloth clothes, and tie leggings. Women wear earrings and silver ornaments on their chests. Their outer garments are very loose and embroidered with wide borders. The "Dingban Yao" wear ancient costumes with many embroidered borders.

In the past, under the long-term reactionary rule, the vast majority of Yao people lived in great hardship. Their main food was corn, sweet potatoes, and taro. Most Yao people made a living by cultivating these crops in the mountains, followed by engaging in side occupations such as chopping wood, burning charcoal, and building bamboo flumes (for making rafts to transport timber). Landlords and local bullies exploited and oppressed the vast majority of Yao people with extremely cruel means. For example, when "borrowing mountains" to grow crops, the harvest was divided into three-seven (landlords getting 70%), and tenants had to treat the landlords to meals and give gifts during the New Year and festivals. Every year in April and May, when most Yao people reached the time of year when the harvest was not yet ripe, they would "sell" the soon-to-be-ripe corn and sweet potatoes to the landlords (called "selling seedlings"), only to receive 20-30% of the value. Moreover, because the mountain soil was barren and lacked fertilizer, crops could only be grown for three or four years on a cleared mountain, so the Yao people who cultivated land had to move frequently, suffering exploitation by the landlords in one place after another. They were never able to eat their fill and often lived by digging wild plants such as banana beans, nightshade vegetables, and fern roots on the mountains. The bullies often plundered, seized, and forcibly bought everything the Yao people owned. For example, Zhao You shun, a Yao villager in Shangwujiang Village, blew a buffalo horn three times after seeing wild boars eating corn. The landlord Li Debang fined him one silver dollar for the crime of "blowing a buffalo horn for no reason." In recent years, they have suffered even more from the Kuomintang reactionaries' conscription of soldiers and laborers, and the imposition of levies. For example, in Jin tian Township, Sixth District, in one bao (unit of one hundred households), with only 166 households, 70 people were conscripted in one year.

The Yao people had a low level of education, with very few people literate. They were very superstitious, and every time there was a good harvest, they would invite witches to "settle the dragon," "worship the gods," and "fulfill vows," with a great deal of eating and drinking. The landlords and local bullies took the opportunity to amass wealth.

Since liberation, the rent reduction movement has been launched, and the Yao people have been happily engaged in production. Most farmers have organized farmers' associations, and have shared in the fruits of victory, defeating the rule of the local bullies and landlords. Recently, the Jianghua County Government has also provided interest-free loans of 100,000 catties of grain to poor Yao people as production funds. Many Yao people have organized to reclaim wasteland, and some are engaged in side occupations such as logging and rafting. In Donghe Township alone, the Yao people have reclaimed more than 7,760 mu of wasteland. Many Yao people, with the help of the government and farmers' associations, have developed production plans, eliminating the annual spring famine that has plagued them for many years. The political status of the Yao people has also been raised. Zhao Zixian, a Yao man from the Fifth District, was elected as a delegate to the recent Hunan Provincial Farmers' Congress. The Yao people reflected: "Without the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, we would not have been able to turn ourselves around in thousands of years. In the past, we couldn't even enter the township office unless we were tied up and taken in for conscription or the imposition of levies."

Recently, the Jianghua County People's Government is preparing to establish a "Nationalities Consultation Committee" to unite the Yao people of the county and carry out construction work in all aspects. (Tang Xuekong, Li Kai, Wenzhong, Li Jinzhang)

### 人民政府大力扶助下  江华徭胞获得新生

　　人民政府大力扶助下
    江华徭胞获得新生
    【本报湖南江华讯】湘桂边境山地里的徭胞，在人民政府的领导下，逐渐走上了新的生活道路。江华全县有徭胞一万八千人，约占总人口的十分之一。其中有“土徭”、“过山徭”、“顶板徭”（过去的统治阶级称他们为“狗头猺”）三种。前两种人数较多。他们大多用布包头，穿土布短衣，扎绑腿。女的带耳环子，胸前挂银块作装饰。外衣很肥大，并镶很宽的花边。“顶板徭”则穿镶很多花边的古装。
    过去在长期的反动统治下，绝大部分徭胞的生活很苦。主要粮食是苞米、红薯和芋头等。一般徭胞大多以开山种植上述粮食为生，其次是从事砍柴、烧炭、打竹笕（供制运输木材的木筏之用）等副业。地主、恶霸以极残酷的手段剥削、压迫着绝大多数的徭胞。例如“借山”种地，收成是三七分（地主得七成），佃户还要请地主吃饭，过年过节要送礼物。每年四、五月，大部分徭胞到了青黄不接的时候，就把快要成熟的苞谷、红薯等“卖”给地主（名为“卖秧子”），只能取得十分之二、三的代价。而且因为山地土质硗薄，肥料缺乏，开山一次只能种庄稼三、四年，因此种地的徭胞必须经常迁居，一处又一处地受着地主的剥削。终身不得一饱，时常以挖山上的芭蕉豆、夜寒菜、蕨根等野草为生。恶霸们更时常掠夺、强占、强买徭胞所有的东西。例如上雾江村徭民赵有顺，看见野猪吃苞谷，吹了三声牛角，地主李德榜就以“无故吹牛角”的罪名，罚他出银洋一元。近年来更受尽国民党反动派抓兵、抓夫、派款的压榨。例如六区锦田乡一保，仅一百六十六户，一年中就被抓兵七十名。
    徭胞的文化程度很低，识字的人极少。迷信很深，每遇丰年，就请巫师来“安龙”、“拜士”、“还愿”，大吃大喝一场。地主、恶霸便乘机敛财。
    解放以后，展开了减租运动，徭民们都很高兴地从事生产。大部分农民已组织了农民协会，并分得了果实，打垮了恶霸地主的统治。最近江华县政府又无利贷给贫苦徭民十万斤谷子，作为生产资金。许多徭民已组织起来开荒，有的经营伐木、扎木筏等副业。仅东河一乡徭民，就开出了荒地七千七百六十多亩。许多徭民并在政府和农协会的帮助下，订出了生产计划，免除了多年来一年一度的春荒。徭民的政治地位也提高了，五区徭民赵自宪，被选为最近举行的湖南全省农民代表大会的代表。徭民们反映：“没有解放军到来，我们再过几千年也翻不了身。过去我们连乡公所也不能进去，除非抓兵、派款被绑了进去。”
    最近江华县人民政府正在准备建立“民族协商委员会”，以团结全县徭胞，开展各方面的建设工作。（唐学孔、李凯、文忠、李锦章）
