　　How State-Owned Enterprises Help Private Enterprises?
    (By our special correspondent Lin Wei)
    In the year since Shanghai's liberation, state-owned enterprises have continuously assisted private industrial and commercial enterprises in various ways, tailored to their different situations and needs, to help them solve specific difficulties and maintain production. Especially during the period of price declines and sluggish sales this spring, the assistance of state-owned enterprises to private enterprises became a major condition for several important industries to overcome their difficulties. The main methods of this assistance are as follows:
    First, some factories do not have great difficulty with working capital, but their sales channels are not smooth, and their capital turnover is slow. For these industries, the various specialized trading companies purchase their products, allowing them to maintain circulation. In the single month from mid-April to mid-May this year, the various trading companies purchased more than 54 billion yuan worth of unsold products from private light industry (excluding the textile industry), enabling 502 factories to carry out reproduction smoothly. From June to December of last year, the total of direct and indirect purchases, plus purchases during the Spring Festival this year, was also more than 30 billion yuan.
    Second, some factories have considerable production capacity but lack working capital and rely on borrowing to circulate funds. For these factories, state-owned enterprises generally use methods such as commissioned processing or ordering to provide assistance. From July of last year to the end of April this year, the state, despite great difficulties and losses, allocated more than 30,000 bales of cotton to private factories for spinning and weaving, 710,000 bolts of cotton cloth for weaving, and 170,000 bolts of cloth for dyeing. The East China Textile Conference in May also basically solved the raw cotton problem for each factory before the new cotton went on the market. This April, orders for various types of steel and electrical machinery reached 25% to 100% of the production capacity of each factory from April to December.
    Third, in addition, some factories have been relying on borrowing to circulate funds since liberation. Later, they lost even the borrowed money, so that they had to use fixed assets to pay off debts. Factories with a small number of people and little impact had to stop work. For those with a large number of people and a great impact, in addition to processing and other assistance, state banks provided loan assistance to prevent them from being forced into collapse by debt. For example, the total debt of the Shenxin Group's factories reached more than 100 billion yuan, but because they were large-scale, modern production institutions involving the employment of 18,000 people, the government adopted a policy of assistance. As of the end of April, the outstanding balance of loans from state banks to private industrial and commercial enterprises was still 200 billion yuan.
    Fourth, in order to ensure that social capital can be invested in production, the government has organized private banks to jointly or individually provide loans to various factories. Those who experience turnover difficulties due to lending to factories can re-mortgage or borrow from the People's Bank. In addition, bill acceptance was held to organize mutual assistance among banking firms. Such as holding temporary re-mortgages among firms in the same industry and fixed and current deposit convenient savings between firms in the same industry.
    The above-mentioned assistance is planned and focused. Generally speaking, the focus of Shanghai's assistance is on industry, and the main focus within industry is on the cotton textile industry, and the main focus within the cotton textile industry is on factories with many employees and the possibility of continuing operations. According to statistics at the end of April, 34.14% of the loans from public and joint public-private banks were lent to the textile industry. The new and old loans of Shenxin's factories alone amounted to 29.1 billion. This policy will continue to be followed in the future. However, in view of the fact that many manufacturers in the past could not deliver goods on time, and still owe a lot of money; a considerable amount of loans have become non-performing loans (such as 22.4 billion yuan of loans before April to Shenxin), which has affected the country's ability to provide further assistance; and the effectiveness of the factories in improving their management is not great, and some even rely solely on government assistance without actively producing. Therefore, since April and May, the industrial and commercial, trade, and banking departments in East China and Shanghai have jointly agreed to adopt the following methods to promote private enterprises to improve their operations and production.
    First, private enterprises receiving assistance are required to provide their own production and improvement plans and financial plans under the overall plan of the state, and these must be investigated and verified by the government's competent authorities. The investigation includes not only the size of the enterprise, the quality of equipment, etc., but also whether labor-management relations are harmonious, whether the capital side has the confidence and enthusiasm to operate, whether the enterprise's organization and production system are reasonable, whether assistance can be effective, and whether the plan is feasible. It is also stipulated that strict performance of the contract is an important condition for assistance. Since April, loans and processing orders to private enterprises have been carried out entirely in accordance with this spirit and practice.
    Second, in addition to the above guarantees, the banking, trade, and industrial and commercial departments, as well as cadres and technicians, in cooperation with the trade union, go directly into the factories to check the progress of production and the use of loans in accordance with the contract, and provide necessary supervision and guidance at any time to help the factories carry out reforms of their organization and system and solve difficult problems. At present, industry-wide labor-management consultation meetings have been organized in more than 30 industries, where both parties openly discuss and solve various problems, so that labor-management relations generally tend to normalize. In several industries, such as cotton spinning, wool spinning, and silk weaving, a joint venture organization has been established to solve some difficulties in production and sales, so that these industries have made some improvements in technology and product quality, and costs have been gradually reduced. The supervision of the East China Industrial Department over steel and electrical machinery factories has led to significant improvements in production efficiency in various factories through certain reforms. The output of Maoxing Steel Plant increased by 43%, and the output of China Steel Plant increased by 25%. The raw materials of each factory have also been saved. Generally, factories now obtain considerable profits and can deliver goods on time.
    The capital side of China, Xingya and other factories are now actively increasing capital and improving equipment. Several cotton spinning factories have also begun to make profits. The number of factories losing money is also gradually decreasing.
    Third, correctly grasp the price of processing and ordering. On the one hand, save the country's funds as much as possible; on the other hand, take into account the cost of reproduction of each factory under current conditions, and give a certain profit when conditions permit. The reduction of cost depends on the subjective efforts and improved management of each factory, and profits are generated from this. For example, if the cost calculation of factories for processing and weaving and steel and electrical machinery is based on the standards of the public China Textile and Shanghai Steel Company, private factories cannot meet the standards temporarily. If the current situation of private factories is used as the standard, it will not promote their reform, and the public will not be able to afford it. Therefore, since April and May, an intermediate standard that takes into account both high and low has been adopted. According to this standard, the processing fee has been increased from 205 units to 224 units; the prices of steel and electrical machinery have also been reduced by 25% to 43% compared to the past. According to this figure, as long as each factory strives to reform, it is possible to break even or even make a profit.
    However, the adjustment of prices cannot be simply calculated and announced by the public, but must be jointly discussed by all parties, public and private, labor and management, so that each factory can recognize its feasibility and the new practices that should be adopted. When the East China Industrial Department placed orders, it convened a meeting of representatives from all parties, public and private, labor and management, to repeatedly discuss the matter; and the public Shanghai Steel Company reported on how its steel rolling cost was reduced from 300 units per ton to 215 units, and its monthly output was increased from 500 tons to 1,000 tons, providing each factory with concrete examples and practices. This finally increased the confidence of each factory and determined to actively improve management. The workers of Maoxing Steel Plant enthusiastically proposed a competition to Shanghai Steel Company and quickly increased production.
    In processing and ordering, private small factories should be encouraged to adopt the methods of division of labor, cooperation, and joint production, so that small factories can also give full play to their production capacity. For example, in the steel industry, small factories are limited by equipment and cannot roll four-inch steel ingots, so they cannot take orders. Let large factories and public factories first open two-inch steel ingots and then hand them over to small factories for rolling. The government should make this division of labor method universally adopted and guide several large and small factories to implement joint production (now seven joint factories have been formed). Therefore, some factories that could not accept orders alone in the past have also received some sporadic orders in the joint venture. This can not only speed up the completion of orders, but also allow each factory to save expenses in the joint venture, learn from each other and improve technology. In the seven joint factories, the technical secrets of the past have gradually been made public. Because the technology of each factory has been improved, more orders can be accepted, which is beneficial to everyone.
    In addition, the recent reduction in railway transportation fees, shipping fees, electricity prices, coal prices, the reduction in loan interest rates, and the adjustment of wholesale and retail prices have all created favorable conditions for the maintenance and recovery of Shanghai's legitimate private industry and commerce.

### 国营企业怎样扶助私营企业？

　　国营企业怎样扶助私营企业？
    （本报特派记者林韦）
    上海解放以来的一年中，国营企业曾不断地按照私营工商业的不同情况和要求，以各种不同的方式，分别帮助他们解决各种具体困难，维持生产。尤其在今春物价下落、货物滞销期间，国营企业对私营企业的扶助，更成了若干重要行业得以度过困难的主要条件。这种扶助的办法，主要的有以下几个方面。
    第一、有一些厂子流动资金不很困难，但销路不畅，资金周转不灵。对于这样的行业，便由各专业贸易公司收购其产品，使它们能够周转。仅在今年四月中旬至五月中旬的一个月间，各贸易公司对私营轻工业（纺织业除外）滞销产品的收购，即达五百四十多亿元，使五百零二家工厂得以顺利进行再生产。去年六月至十二月间，直接间接的收购，加上今年春节的收购，一共也在三百亿元以上。
    第二、有一些厂子有相当生产能力，但没有流动资金，而依靠借债来周转，对于这些厂子，国营企业一般是用委托加工或订货的办法加以扶助。从去年七月至今年四月底，国家在重重困难与赔钱的条件之下，向私厂配棉代纺棉纱达三万多件，代织棉布七十一万匹，代染布十七万匹。五月份华东纺织会议，更基本上解决了各厂在新花上市以前的原棉问题。今年四月钢铁、电机的各类订货，已达到四月至十二月各厂生产能力的百分之二十五至一百。
    第三、另外有些厂子，解放以来一直依靠借债来周转，后来连债款也赔了，以致必须用固定资产抵偿债款。其中人数较少、影响不大的厂子，只得停工。人数很多，影响很大的，则除了加工等扶助外，并由国家银行进行贷款扶助，使之不致为债务所逼垮。如申新所属各厂负债总额达千亿元以上，但因他们是大规模的近代化生产机构，且涉及一万八千人的职业问题，政府便采取了扶助的方针。截至四月底，国家银行对私营工商业的贷款余额尚有二千亿元。
    第四、为使社会资金都能投入生产，政府曾组织私营行庄，向各工厂联合放款或单独放款。因向工厂放款而发生周转困难者，均可向人民银行转抵押或拆借。且又举办票据承兑，组织行庄同业间的互助。如举办同业临时转抵押和同业之间定期与活期两便存款等。
    上述各种扶植是有计划、有重点的。一般说，上海扶植的重点是工业，工业中主要的是棉纺业，棉纺业中主要的是员工众多，并有可能维持下去的厂子。四月底统计，公营与公私合营银行的放款，有百分之三四·一四是贷给纺织业的。而申新各厂新旧贷款即达二九一亿。今后当仍本此方针继续扶助。但鉴于过去加工订货中不少厂家不能按期交货，至今仍拖欠甚多；贷款中也有相当数量成为呆账（如申新四月份前贷款二二四亿全部呆滞），影响了国家的再扶助能力；且各厂改进经营的成效也不大，甚至有的单纯依赖政府扶助而不积极生产。因此，从四、五月份以来，华东区与上海市的工商、贸易、银行等部门共同商定采用以下办法，以促进私营企业改善经营，改进生产。
    第一、要求被扶植的私营企业，在国家总的计划之下，提供自己的生产与改进计划、财务计划，并要经过政府主管部门调查核实。调查内容，除企业大小、设备好坏等项以外，并包括劳资关系是否协调、资方是否具有经营的信心与积极性、企业机构与生产制度是否合理、扶助是否确能生效、计划有无实现可能等项目。并规定以严格履行合同为扶助的重要条件。四月份以来，对私营企业的贷款及加工订货，就是完全遵照了这一精神与做法的。
    第二、在上述保证以外，银行、贸易与工商等部门，并调派干部与技术人员，配合工会，直接深入各厂，根据合同，检查生产进行情形与贷款使用情形，随时给予必要的督促与指导，帮助各厂进行机构制度的改革，解决困难问题。现在，三十多个行业中已组织了全行业性的劳资协商会议，双方开诚布公地商量解决各种问题，使劳资关系一般趋向正常化。在棉纺织、毛纺、丝织等若干行业中，组织了联营机构，解决了生产与推销中的若干困难，使这些行业在技术与产品质量上得到了一些改进，成本已逐步降低。华东工业部对钢铁、电机厂的督导，已使各厂经过某些改革，生产效率显著提高。茂兴钢铁厂产量提高百分之四十三，中华铁厂提高产量百分之二十五。各厂原料也节省了。一般厂子现在都获得相当利润，并能按期交货。
    中华、兴亚等厂的资方现正积极增加资金，改良设备。棉纺织厂，也有几家开始有了盈余。赔钱的也在逐渐减少。
    第三、正确掌握加工、订货的价格。一方面尽可能节省国家的资金；另一方面照顾目前条件下各厂再生产的成本，并在条件允许时，给以一定利润。成本的减低要靠各厂的主观努力与改进经营才能达到，利润也由此而产生。比如代纺代织的工厂与钢铁电机的成本计算，如果以公营中纺及上海钢铁公司为标准，则私营厂目前一时不可能达到标准。如果以私营厂的现状为标准，则不能促进其改革，公家也赔不起。所以从四、五月份起，开始采取高低兼顾的中间性标准。按这标准，代纺工缴从二○五单位提高到二二四单位；钢铁、电机价格也比过去降低百分之二十五到四十三。按照这一数目，只要各厂努力改革，是有可能做到保本甚至获得利润的。
    但是，价格的调整，不能单纯由公家计算公布，而须经过公私、劳资各方面的共同协商，才能使各厂认识其实现的可能性和应采取的新的做法。华东工业部订货时，召集了公私、劳资各方代表的会议，反复研讨；并由公营上海钢铁公司报告其轧钢成本由每吨三百单位减低到二一五单位、月产量从五百吨提高到一千吨的经过，给各厂提供了具体的范例与做法。这样终于使各厂信心提高，决心积极改进经营。茂兴钢铁厂的工人则热情澎湃地向上海钢铁公司提出竞赛，迅速提高了产量。
    在加工、订货中，应鼓励私营小厂，采用分工合作、联合生产的方法，使小厂也能充分发挥其生产能力。比如钢铁工业，小厂限于设备，不能轧制四英寸钢锭，不能揽货，便让大厂与公营厂先开成二英寸钢锭，再交小厂轧制。政府应使这种分工办法普遍被采用，并指导若干大小厂子实行联合生产（现已有七联厂组成）。因此，原来有些不能单独接受订货的厂子，也都在联合中得到若干零星定货。这样既能使订货迅速完成，又能使各厂在联合中节约开支，互相观摩研究，提高技术。七联厂中，过去技术上的秘密现已逐渐公开。因为各厂技术都提高了，可以多接受订货，对大家都有利。
    此外，最近铁路运输费、航运费、电价、煤价的减低，贷款利息的减低，批发价与零售价的调整，都使上海正当的私营工商业的维持与恢复获得了有利的条件。
