Ministry of Interior Notifies All Regions
Summarize Experiences in Production and Disaster Relief Work

[This Newspaper’s Dispatch] The Ministry of Interior of the Central People's Government issued a "Notice on Summarizing Production and Disaster Relief Work" on May 28th. The notice pointed out that since last summer, the people in all disaster areas, under the leadership of the People's Government, have been continuously fighting against the disaster and have achieved great results. It is urgent to seriously summarize the work experience in order to guide future production and disaster relief work, and thereby improve other work.

The notice stipulates that the following points should be noted in the summary:

(1) Clarify the disaster situation: How many mu of farmland were affected by the disaster? (The standards for light and heavy disasters must be consistent. Harvests of 20% or less, and no harvest, are considered heavy disasters; 20% to 50% are considered light disasters; 60% or more are not considered disasters.) How many disaster victims are there? (How many disaster victims need relief? How many need long-term relief? How many do not need relief?) The precise figures for all kinds of disaster relief grains and funds spent and how they were distributed, etc.

(2) Write down the disaster relief process: What measures were taken at the beginning of the disaster (last summer and autumn) (such as reinforcing dikes, fighting floods, and catching pests)? What measures were taken when the disaster had already occurred (such as draining water and planting wheat, organizing sideline production, work-for-relief, immigration, etc.)? What measures were taken last winter and this spring and in more urgent times? What experience has been gained? And are there any shortcomings in foresight, delays in action, or underestimation of the disaster?

(3) Understanding and implementation of disaster relief guidelines and methods: The disaster relief guideline is to focus on production for self-relief, supplemented by government relief, social mutual assistance, and economy campaigns. The disaster relief method is for leaders at all levels of government to go deep into the disaster areas, supervise cadres, lead the people, and use the people's wisdom and labor to tirelessly fight against the disaster with various methods. How well did you do? What innovations have you made? What problems have you discovered? Whether they belong to individuals or to the system.

(4) Leadership organs and cadre style: In the struggle against disaster, the good or bad style of cadres is most easily revealed. A good style immediately yields results, and a bad style immediately causes problems. Especially in times of disaster emergency. It is necessary to review good or bad typical examples, so that people can learn from the good ones and be warned by the bad ones.

(5) Lessons learned. After this work, do the leading organs and the people have any guarantees that if they encounter the same disaster situation in the future, they can overcome it without detours; and what measures should be taken in peacetime, and are there any major lessons that can transform our cadre style and advance democratic governance?

(6) Based on the specific experience of various regions, do you have any revisions or supplements to the central government's instructions and the reports of responsible comrades? What are your opinions on the disaster relief measures of the higher-level government?

The notice stated: This year's disaster relief is a great work, related to the life and death of tens of millions of people. It is hoped that all regions will conduct in-depth and humble reviews, and say what they have to say. The summary should not be long, and materials can be attached as appendices. The summary meeting in your area (many places have had summaries, just need to re-examine and revise) can be convened by the Production and Disaster Relief Committee or the civil affairs department, but the government负责人 must participate, and the government负责人 should guide the summary. We will use the summaries of disaster relief work in various regions as the basis for the national disaster relief work summary. Please send your written summary by July 1st.

### 内务部通知各地  总结生产救灾工作经验

　　内务部通知各地
    总结生产救灾工作经验
    【本报讯】中央人民政府内务部于五月二十八日发布“关于总结生产救灾工作的通知”。通知中指出：自去夏以来，各灾区的人民在人民政府领导下，不断地对灾荒作斗争，得到了伟大成绩。亟应把工作经验认真总结一下，以便指导今后生产救灾工作，并由此而改善其他工作。
    通知规定总结应注意之点如下：
    （一）把受灾情况弄清楚：如受灾田亩有多少？（轻重灾标准要一致，收成在二成以下及无收成者为重灾，二成至五成者为轻灾，六成以上者不为灾。）灾民有多少？（需救济的灾民多少？需长期救济的多少？不需救济的多少？）用去各种救灾粮款的精确数字及如何分配等。
    （二）把救灾经过写下来：初灾的时候（去年夏秋间）采取了些什么措施（如上堤抢险捕打害虫等）？已成灾的时候，又采取了些什么措施（如排水种麦，组织副业生产，以工代赈，移民等）？去冬今春及较紧急时候，又采取了些什么措施？有何经验？及有无预见不够、动手过迟与轻视灾荒的毛病。
    （三）把握与贯彻救灾方针与方法的情况：救灾的方针是以生产自救为主、辅之以政府救济，社会互济和节约运动等。救灾的方法，是各级政府领导人深入灾区，督率干部，领导人民，用人民的智慧劳力与各种方法和灾荒作不疲倦的斗争。你处做得怎么样？有什么创造？发现什么毛病？不论是属于个人的或属于制度的。
    （四）领导机关和干部作风：和灾荒作斗争中，最易显出干部作风好与坏。作风好，马上有成绩，作风不好，马上出乱子。特别是灾荒紧急的时候。必须检讨出好的或坏的典型例子，好的使人学，坏的使人戒。
    （五）经验教训。经过这次工作，领导机关及人民有无保证可使今后如遇同样灾情可以不走弯路即可度过；而在平时即要做些什么措施，又有无重大教训材料，可以改造我们干部作风，并可使民主建政前进一步。
    （六）根据各地具体经验，你处对中央指示及负责同志的报告有无修正或补充。对上级政府的救灾措施有何意见。
    通知称：今年的救灾是一伟大工作，关系上千万人的生死问题，望各地深入地虚心地检讨，有什么说什么。总结的文字不要长，有材料可作附件，你处的总结会议（许多地方有过总结，只须重新审核修正）或由生救会召开或民政部门召开均可，但政府负责人必须参加，由政府负责人指导作总结。我们将以各地救灾工作的总结作全国救灾工作总结的张本。你处书面总结，望于七月一日以前送到。
