　　Stable Prices, Increased Real Purchasing Power
　　Smooth Exchange of Industrial and Agricultural Products in Beijing
　　Food Exports and Imports Increased in May, Cotton Cloth Exports Increased by 80% Compared to April.

　　[This Newspaper's Report] With price stabilization, real purchasing power is gradually increasing. The price differences between regions have also been reasonably adjusted, resulting in increasingly active material exchanges between Beijing and other places.

　　First, there is an increase in the quantity of industrial and agricultural product exchanges. In May, 14,013 bolts of cotton cloth were sold through the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, an increase of more than 82% compared to the 7,660 bolts in April. Simultaneously, both food imports and exports increased: May saw imports of over 50,520,000 catties, an increase of more than 27% compared to April; exports were over 10,167,000 catties, an increase of more than 42% compared to April.

　　In May, some materials were also imported through inter-city drafts at the National Bank. According to statistics from the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, a total of three inter-city import drafts and twenty-four inter-city export drafts were collected for a total import value of 400 million yuan. These included: miscellaneous grains transported from Gui Sui, sesame transported from Shangqiu, butter and buckwheat transported from Jining, and fans and paper transported from Shaoxing and Jiaxing. The Beijing Native Produce Company also transported large quantities of Zhejiang cool mats, Zhangjiakou melon seeds, Northeast wild mushrooms, and Henan tree fungus this month to meet market needs. Specialized companies dealing in cotton yarn and cloth, petroleum, etc., also transported large quantities of goods to rural areas through their branches. According to statistics, the Petroleum Company sold a total of 26,013 gallons of petroleum for the month (approximately 90% was transported to various counties in the Baoding and Tongxian special districts). The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company sold 253 bolts of cotton yarn and 218 bolts of cloth directly to Nanyuan, Tongxian, Dingxing, and Zhuoxian areas. All export volumes were higher than in April.

　　Secondly, the business of cooperative warehouses and some private grain and goods warehouses has become more prosperous, and the trading volume between state-owned department stores and merchants from other places has increased. After prices began to stabilize in March, cooperative warehouses experienced a decline in business due to a sudden reduction in material exchanges, but the situation improved in May. In May, the warehouse purchased goods on behalf of others (including cotton cloth, cotton yarn, cigarettes, bicycle tires, and grain, etc.) with a total value of 2,327,700,000 yuan, and sold goods on behalf of others (including Northwest grain and Northeast paper, white sugar, live pigs, etc.) with a total value of 5,466,200,000 yuan. Compared to April, the portion purchased on behalf of others increased by 1,002,718,900 yuan, and the portion sold on behalf of others increased by 1,623,783,300 yuan. Some private grain and goods warehouses have also seen improvements in their business, such as the Huitong warehouse, which saw an increase in customers from Sui and Baotou in the Northwest in May.

　　Outbound sales of department stores have also become smoother. In May, the Dongxiaoshi Wholesale Department of the state-owned Beijing Department Store Company, whose main business is supplying purchases from other places, sold a total value of 799,900,000 yuan of department store goods, more than doubling the total sales in April. Of these, the portion transported to other places accounted for approximately 40% of the total value in April and approximately 60% of the total value in May.

　　Thirdly, remittance business has gradually become more frequent. In May, public and private banks and firms (including postal remittances) remitted a total of 38,967 transactions, totaling 201.3 billion yuan. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China remitted 9,573 transactions, totaling 166.6 billion yuan. The remittance amount was basically the same as in the previous month, but the number of remittance transactions increased by 2,554 in May compared to April. Among the remittances, purchases of grain accounted for more than 12% of the total remittances, an increase of 3.5 percentage points from 8.7% in the previous month. In addition, professional companies such as Jingdan Products remitted 7.3 billion yuan to Tongxian, Baoding, Tangshan, and other places to purchase eggs, and more than 5 billion yuan to Zhangjiakou and other places to purchase furs.

　　According to statistics from the Cooperative Department of the People's Bank of China, the total amount of funds remitted by cooperative societies in various regions through the department in May was more than 1.9 billion yuan, more than doubling the 800 million yuan in April. After entering June, urban-rural exchanges have become increasingly active. The amount of new wheat from the eight counties in eastern Beijing, such as Xianghe, and Baoding and the suburbs of Beijing is increasing daily. The business of cooperative warehouses has also continued to develop. In just the first ten days of the month, the total value of sales and purchases on behalf of others was more than 4.8 billion yuan, exceeding half of the total value of sales and purchases on behalf of others for the entire month of May, which was 7.7 billion yuan. In mid-June, professional companies such as Jinghua Cotton Yarn and Cloth are preparing to cooperate with wheat harvesting and promote the sale of cloth and other products to the countryside. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China is also simplifying inter-city draft procedures in a timely manner to promote urban-rural material exchanges through the development of draft business.

　　物价稳定，真实购买力增长
    京工农业产品交流转畅 
    五月份食粮输出输入均有增加，棉布外销较四月份增多百分之八十。
    【本报讯】物价稳定后真实购买力正在逐渐增长，地区间物价的差额又经过合理调整，京市与外地的物资交流因之日趋活跃。
    首先是工、农业产品交流数量的增加。五月份中，通过纱布交易所外销的棉布有一万四千零十三匹，较四月份的七千六百六十匹增加了百分之八十二强。同时输入、输出的粮食也均有增加：五月份共输入五千零五十二万余斤，较四月份增加百分之二十七强；输出一千零十六万七千余斤，较四月份增加百分之四十二强。
    五月份通过国家银行埠际押汇，还输入了一部分物资。据人民银行北京分行统计：全月共做埠际进口押汇三笔，代收埠际出口押汇二十四笔，共输入总值四亿元货物。其中包括：由归绥运来的杂粮，由商邱运来的芝麻，由集宁运来的牛油、荞麦，和由绍兴、嘉兴运来的扇子和纸张等。京市土产公司在这个月也运来浙江凉席，张家口瓜子，东北元蘑，河南木耳等大批土产，供应了市场需要。花纱布、石油等专业公司也均有大量货物通过分支机构输向农村。据统计：石油公司全月共售出石油二万六千零十三加仑（约百分之九十输向保定、通县两专区各县）。花纱布公司全月有棉纱二百五十三块，布二百十八匹直接销到南苑、通县、定兴、涿县一带。输出量均较四月为多。
    其次是合作货栈、部分私营粮、货栈业务转繁，和国营百货公司与外地行商交易量的增多。合作货栈在三月物价开始平稳后，由于物资交流突然减少，业务曾趋于清淡，五月份又已好转。五月份该栈代购货物（包括：棉布、棉纱、纸烟及自行车胎及粮食等）总值二十三亿二千七百余万元，代销货物（包括：西北粮食及东北纸张、白糖、活猪等）总值五十四亿六千二百余万元。五月和四月比较，代购部分增加十亿零二千七百十八万九千元，代销部分增加十六亿二千三百七十八万三千元。一些私营粮货栈的业务也都有起色，如惠通等货栈，五月份由西北绥、包来的客人增多了。
    百货外销亦已转畅。五月份，以供应外地采购为主要业务的国营北京市百货公司东晓市批发部，全月销售百货总值七亿九千九百余万元，较四月销售总额增加了两倍以上。其中属于外运部分的，四月分约占总值的百分之四十，五月份约占总值百分之六十。
    再次是汇兑业务逐渐频繁。五月份全市公私行庄（邮局汇兑也在内）汇出款项计有三万八千九百六十七笔，共二千零十三亿元。人民银行北京分行汇出款项九千五百七十三笔，共一千六百六十六亿元。汇款金额基本上与上月相同，但在汇款笔数上，五月较四月份增加了二千五百五十四笔。在汇出款项中，购买粮食的占汇出总额百分之十二强，较上月百分之八点七，增加了三点五。此外还有京蛋品等专业公司汇往通县、保定、唐山等地收购鸡蛋的款项七十三亿元，汇往张家口等地收购皮毛的五十余亿元。
    另据人民银行合作部统计，五月份各地区合作社通过该部汇出款项总额十九余亿元，较四月份八亿余元增加一倍多。进入六月后，城乡交流益显畅旺。京东香河等八县和保定及京郊一带所产的新麦上市量日见增加。合作货栈的业务也续有开展，只上旬十天中代销、代购的总额就有四十八亿余元，超过该栈五月全月代销代购总额七十七亿余元的半数。六月中旬，京花纱布等专业公司正准备配合收麦，推销布匹等产品下乡。人民银行北京分行也适时的简化埠际押汇手续，用开展押汇业务，来促进城乡物资交流。
