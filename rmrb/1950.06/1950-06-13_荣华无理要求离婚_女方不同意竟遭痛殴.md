Rong Hua Unreasonably Demands Divorce; Woman Beaten for Disagreeing
To the Editors:

　　Rong Hua, the deputy director of the Fengtai Branch of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, as a revolutionary cadre, has distorted the spirit of "freedom of divorce" in the Marriage Law, unreasonably demanding a divorce from his wife; and has abused her because she did not want a divorce.

　　Rong Hua and his wife, Zhang Ruiru, were married in 1939 and had three children (two of whom have died). In November 1949, Rong Hua brought Zhang Ruiru from the countryside to Beijing. Initially, their relationship was good, but later Rong Hua expressed his dislike for her. On April 24th of this year, Rong Hua filed a divorce request with the Beijing People's Court, citing reasons such as "the woman is fat, stupid and displeasing to the eye, and her speech is nagging and unpleasant to the ear."

　　The Eleventh District Trial Group of the Beijing People's Court conducted mediation on this case in accordance with the Marriage Law. During the first hearing on May 19th, Rong Hua opposed the mediation. During the second hearing on May 26th, he criticized the court for "unprincipled caution" and complained: "I have been a revolutionary for many years and shed much blood and sweat. Today, I can't even solve the problem of my wife." When the recorder read the mediation record and listened to the woman, Zhang Ruiru's, opinions on the record, Rong Hua disregarded the law and lost his temper, kicking Zhang Ruiru in the courtroom. At the same time, he threatened the judge to immediately grant the divorce. The judge immediately gave Rong Hua a serious criticism. However, he remained adamant and did not admit his mistake.

　　After the first mediation in court, Rong Hua beat Zhang Ruiru with a bamboo curtain at home because she did not agree to the divorce, causing her nose and mouth to bleed.

　　Now, the People's Court will impose criminal punishment on Rong Hua for his criminal behavior of abusing his wife and even disregarding the laws and dignity of the People's Government by openly beating her in court. The marriage part will be resolved after the criminal part is settled, in accordance with the spirit of the Marriage Law to protect the interests of women and children, and a reasonable judgment will be made.

### 荣华无理要求离婚  女方不同意竟遭痛殴

　　荣华无理要求离婚  女方不同意竟遭痛殴编者同志：
    北京市供销合作总社丰台分社副主任荣华，身为革命干部，竟曲解婚姻法“离婚自由”的精神，无理要与妻子离婚；并因妻子不愿离婚而加以虐待。
    荣华与其妻张瑞如，在一九三九年结婚，并生过三个孩子（已死了二个）。一九四九年十一月，荣华把张瑞如从农村接到北京。起初双方感情尚好，后来荣华便对她表示厌弃。今年四月二十四日，荣华竟以“女的肥蠢不顺眼，说话絮叨不顺耳”为理由向北京市人民法院提出离婚要求。
    北京市人民法院第十一区审判组曾根据婚姻法，对此案件进行了调解。五月十九日第一次开庭时，荣华对于调解表示反对。五月二十六日第二次开庭时，他批评法院“无原则的慎重”，并发牢骚说：“我革命多年，流了多少血汗。到今天老婆问题都解决不了。”当记录员朗读调解笔录，并听取女方张瑞如对笔录的意见时，荣华竟目无法纪，大发脾气，在法庭上猛踢张瑞如一脚。同时，并威胁审判员，要他立即判决离婚。审判员当即给荣华以严肃的批评。而他却依然态度强硬，不承认错误。
    在法院第一次调解之后，荣华竟因张瑞如不同意离婚，于回家后用竹帘将张痛殴，以致口鼻出血。
    现在人民法院对荣华虐待妻子，甚至不顾人民政府的法令与尊严，公开在法庭上打人的犯罪行为，将予以刑事处分。其婚姻部分则在刑事部分解决之后，再根据婚姻法保护妇女儿童利益的精神，予以合理的判决。
