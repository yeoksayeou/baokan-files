Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 20th: The people of Southwest China are extremely moved after the official commencement of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The Second Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Conference congratulated the event on behalf of 1.2 million citizens. The Chongqing Xinhua Daily, Dagong Daily, and Xinmin Daily all published editorials to celebrate. The Chongqing Xinhua Daily editorial stated: "The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which has been marked as 'incomplete' on maps for over forty years, will gradually be laid on the ground from today. This is a major event related to the construction of Southwest China. All the people of Southwest China are cheering, and it is valued by the people of the whole country." The Xinmin Daily editorial stated: "In the current situation of financial difficulties, the Central People's Government still allocates huge sums of money for construction, turning the decades of hope of the people of Southwest China into reality. All of this demonstrates the People's Government's determination for production and construction, and its responsible attitude towards the people." The Chongqing business community unanimously believes that the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has created favorable conditions for the recovery and development of industry and commerce in Southwest China. The person in charge of the China Shipping Company said: In the past, the reactionary government used the excuse of building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to embezzle countless amounts of the people's wealth, resulting in nothing more than a dotted line on the map. Now, only a few months after the liberation of Southwest China, the forty-year ideal of the people of Southwest China has begun to be realized under the leadership of the People's Government.

    西南人民四十年来的理想在人民政府领导下实现了
    【新华社重庆二十日电】成渝铁路正式开工后，西南人民无限感奋。重庆市第二届各界人民代表会并代表全市一百二十万市民祝贺。重庆市新华日报、大公报、新民报均发表社论祝贺。重庆新华日报社论写道：“过去在地图上以‘未成’符号记载了四十几年的成渝铁路，从今天起将逐步铺设在地面上。这是有关西南建设的大事。全西南人民都在欢腾，并为全国人民所重视”。新民报的社论写道：“在财经困难的目前情况中，中央人民政府仍拨出巨额款子来兴工，把西南人民数十年的希望变成事实。这一切标志出人民政府对生产建设的决心，与对人民负责的态度”。重庆工商界一致认为：成渝铁路的兴建，为西南工商业的恢复和发展创立了有利条件。华中轮船公司负责人称：过去反动政府借口修筑成渝铁路，不知搜刮了多少民脂民膏，结果只是在地图上划了一条虚线。现在西南解放才几个月，西南人民四十多年来的理想，在人民政府领导下就开始实现了。
