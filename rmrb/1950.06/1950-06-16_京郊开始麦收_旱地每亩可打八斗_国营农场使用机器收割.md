　　Suburban Beijing Begins Wheat Harvest
    Dry Land Yields Eight Dou Per Mu
    State-Owned Farms Use Machinery for Harvesting
    [This Newspaper Reports] The suburbs of Beijing in June are filled with the sweet, fragrant aroma of ripened wheat. The 350,000 mu of wheat fields sown last year are partly entering the summer harvest. According to experienced veteran farmers: This year's dry wheat can yield eight to nine dou per mu, which is an 80% yield. Watered wheat fields, due to the effects of wind damage and jaundice disease this year, can yield five dou to one shi per mu. If there are no diseases or disasters, they could yield up to two shi.
    Now, the emancipated peasants in the suburbs of Beijing are tensely and enthusiastically busy with the first year's wheat harvest on the land allocated for their use. (Han Yu)
    [This Newspaper Reports] Wheat in the suburbs of this city is ripe. The state-owned farms under the Beijing Suburban Farm Administration Bureau began harvesting on the 14th. This harvest will utilize three combine harvesters and tractor-combine harvesters imported from the Soviet Union this spring. Each machine can harvest 90 to 120 mu per day. The Zhanghua Farm and Jushan Farm in the western suburbs began harvesting on the 15th; the Tian'enzhuang Farm, Wulidian Farm, and Qianzhuangzi Farm near Wulidian in the southern suburbs will begin harvesting on the 18th; the Demaozhuang Farm and Dashengzhuang Farm in the southern suburbs will begin harvesting from the 16th to the 18th; the Shuangqiao Farm in the eastern suburbs is scheduled to begin harvesting around the 18th. At that time, the Ministry of Agriculture's Mechanized Farming School located at that farm will also hold a mechanized farming exhibition to introduce the school's learning situation and the general situation of Soviet mechanized farming. All organizations and groups are welcome to visit these farms at that time.

　　京郊开始麦收
    旱地每亩可打八斗
    国营农场使用机器收割
    【本报讯】六月的京郊，到处充满着小麦成熟后的芬芳香甜气味。去年播种的三十五万亩麦田，部分已进入夏收。据有经验的老农谈：今年旱麦每亩可打八斗至九斗，是八成年景。水地麦田，因今年风摇及黄疸病的影响，每亩可打五斗至一石，如无病害灾情可打到两石。
    现在京郊翻身农民正紧张热烈地在分给自己使用的土地上忙着第一年的麦收。（寒玉）
    【本报讯】本市郊区小麦已熟，京郊农场管理局所属各国营农场十四日起开始收割。此次收割共出动三部今春从苏联运来的康拜因机和拖拉康拜因机，每部每日可收割九十亩到一百二十亩。西郊区彰化农场、聚山农场十五日即开始收割；南苑五里店附近的天恩庄农场、五里店农场、钱庄子农场，十八日起开始收割；南苑区德茂庄农场和大生庄农场，十六日至十八日开始收割；东郊双桥农场约于十八日开始收割。届时设在该场的农业部机耕学校并举办机耕展览会，介绍该校学习情形及苏联机耕概况。以上各场均欢迎各机关团体届时前往参观。
