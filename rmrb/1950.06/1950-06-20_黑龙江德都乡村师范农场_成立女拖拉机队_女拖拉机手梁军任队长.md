　　Heilongjiang Dedu Rural Normal School Farm

    Establishes Female Tractor Team

    Female Tractor Driver Liang Jun Appointed as Captain
    [Our Newspaper, Dedu County, Heilongjiang Province] The Dedu Mengya Rural Normal School Farm established a female tractor team on June 3rd, with female tractor driver Liang Jun as the captain. Since Liang Jun, the first female tractor driver in New China, appeared at the school farm's tractor team in 1948, it has overcome difficulties and gradually developed over nearly two years. Now it has ten female comrades and forty-five male comrades. When learning the technology initially, there were no technicians. Eighteen young men and women reclaimed wasteland on the boundless grasslands, where wild animals roamed, living in temporary dugouts at night. When the machines broke down, everyone discussed and studied, carefully repairing them according to the "Tractor Manual." In addition to studying technology, they also studied politics and culture during their rest time. Under such harsh conditions, they cultivated 500 hectares of virgin land last year using four tractors (each hectare is equivalent to 15 mu within the customs), and their skills also improved. This year, technicians and full-time teachers have been hired, and with specialized guidance and classes, their technical, political, and cultural levels have rapidly improved. More than half can independently master and drive tractors. On June 3rd, they held a formal establishment meeting for the female tractor team. The Secretary of the Dedu County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Dedu County Head, and the Director of the County Women's Federation all attended. After the meeting, the female team members started three tractors, with red flags presented by the County Committee and County Government hanging in front, and circled the school buildings once. More than 300 faculty and staff of the entire school lined up on both sides of the avenue, enthusiastically applauding and shouting slogans of congratulations. Qiu Jian, Secretary of the Dedu County Committee of the Communist Party of China, said in his speech: "The establishment of our female tractor team is the herald of agricultural mechanization in the Northeast and opens up a new path for female compatriots across the country. Everyone should make persistent efforts, further improve their skills, expand the number of female team members, and strive to transform the backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country as soon as possible." All the female team members solemnly swore an oath before the portrait of the great people's leader Chairman Mao: "... We are determined to unite the broad masses of new women, participate in production and construction together, and strive for the agricultural mechanization of New China."

　　黑龙江德都乡村师范农场
    成立女拖拉机队         
    女拖拉机手梁军任队长
    【本报黑龙江省德都县讯】德都萌芽乡村师范学校农场，于六月三日成立了女拖拉机队，由女拖拉机手梁军任队长。该校农场的拖拉机队，自一九四八年出现了新中国第一名女拖拉机手梁军以来，在将近两年的过程中，克服困难，逐渐发展，现在已有了十名女同志和四十五名男同志，最初学习技术时，没有技师，十八名男女青年，在漫无边际、野兽出没的草原上开荒，晚间住在临时架起的小窝堡里。机器发生了故障时，大家就讨论研究，按着“拖拉机须知”去细心修理。休息时间除钻研技术外，还学习政治和文化。在这样艰苦的条件下，去年中她们利用四台拖拉机开垦了生荒五百垧（每垧合关内十五亩），技术上也有进步。今年起增聘了技师和专任教员，有了专人指导、上课，她们的技术、政治、文化水平均迅速提高，半数以上能独自掌握和驾驶拖拉机了。六月三日，她们举行了女拖拉机队正式成立大会。中共德都县委书记、德都县长、县妇联主任等均前往参加。会后，女队员们开动了三台拖拉机，前面挂着县委、县政府赠送的红旗，在校舍周围绕行一周。全校教职员工三百余人列队于大道两侧，热烈鼓掌、喊口号祝贺。中共德都县委书记邱健在讲话中说：“我们女拖拉机队的成立，是东北农业机械化的先声，给全国女同胞开辟了一条新的道路。大家要再接再厉，进一步提高技术，扩大女队员的数量，争取把落后的农业国早日改变为先进的工业国。”全体女队员在伟大的人民领袖毛主席画像前庄严宣誓：“……我们决心团结广大新妇女，一道参加生产建设，为新中国农业机械化而奋斗。”
