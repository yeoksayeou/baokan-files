　　“New Folk Art Experiment Mobile Group”
    Zhang Shikai
    In order to implement the policy of drama and folk art reform of the Bureau of Drama Improvement of the Ministry of Culture in 1950 and the instructions of the Ministry of Culture for launching literary and artistic work in the spring, the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Folk Art Improvement Association formed the "New Folk Art Experiment Mobile Group" at the end of March this year. The group's members include thirteen folk artists from Beijing, Baoding, Xinxiang, and other places. Its purpose is to create experience, cultivate core artists, improve folk art, and unite old artists to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. The current specific task is to introduce new folk art, give demonstration performances to workers in various places to encourage and improve workers' production enthusiasm, and to collect deeds of labor heroes and model workers at any time to provide materials for creating new folk art lyrics and scripts. The forms of their performances are diverse, including Jingyun Dagu, Xihé Dagu, Danxian, Henan Zhuizi, etc., and they are also accompanied by some magic and various skills and acrobatics.
    In early April, with the assistance of the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union, this group visited Baoding, Changxindian, Fengtai, Huangcun, Beijing, and other stations along the Beijing-Hankou and Beijing-Tianjin Railways. The new programs that can reflect the current stage of workers' lives are generally welcomed by the workers. For example, "Good Couple" and "Great Production," which encourage production enthusiasm; "Train Driver Zhang Fulin" and "Ten Daughters Praise Husband," which explain the greatness of the working people. After watching and listening, the workers felt extraordinarily cordial and deeply moved. The workers of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot wrote in the opinion book: "The workers of our Fengtai Locomotive Depot especially love this new type of art. We hope that the comrades of the new folk art can come to perform for us regularly to improve our production enthusiasm. In these three days of performances, we believe that the most outstanding achievement is Comrade Wei Bingshan's "Chiang Kai-shek Sells the Country," a feeling of hatred and anger that resonated with workers who have personally suffered oppression, strengthening our determination to fight from the sea of hatred. Comrade Li Decheng's "Good Couple" gave a very appropriate evaluation of the new labor attitude, and it was performed both lightly and seriously. Comrade Wei Guoliang's "Train Driver Zhang Fulin" was performed vividly and vividly, showing the firm confidence of the working class..." This is the reflection of the new folk art in the working masses.
    In early May, this mobile group also participated in the literary and artistic work team organized by the Cultural and Educational Department of the Railway Trade Union, working in various stations, sections, and factories of the Tianjin Railway Bureau for a whole month. Their activities spread to various factories, sites, carriages, ticket offices, passenger lounges, and squares for various mass gatherings. Because folk art is an art familiar to the broad masses of working people, it is generally praised by the working masses in various places. In order to make the new folk art universally penetrate the people and occupy the vast positions occupied by the old folk art full of feudal superstition, it is necessary to strengthen ties with old artists in various places and help them progress. Wherever they went with the literary and artistic work team, they planned to hold joint symposiums of new and old artists to introduce materials to each other, discuss the improvement of old folk art, and point out the path of improvement to local old artists.
    Since the establishment of the experimental group, they have adopted the "cooperative and mutually beneficial" approach with the Railway Trade Union and the North China General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore, and have gained good experience:
    The experimental group helped railway workers to engage in recreational activities and assisted the trade union in solving the problem of the lack of recreational work cadres. On the other hand, with the help of the Railway Trade Union, the experimental group solved the difficulty of transportation funds. At the same time, they also got the opportunity to serve the workers directly, get close to the working masses, exercise themselves, transform themselves, and then understand the lives of the workers, collect materials, and provide materials for creation, so as to improve and enrich the content of the new folk art.
    The experimental group also cooperated with Xinhua Bookstore to help the bookstore promote popular books and periodicals to the broad masses of workers and peasants, and posted advertisements for the bookstore to promote and introduce workers' and peasants' reading materials. At the same time, the experimental group also sold popular versions of new folk art. In the promotion work, the bookstore gave them certain preferential discounts. In this way, the experimental group was partially helped to solve the funding problem.
    This method of multi-party cooperation and mutual assistance under the same goal of serving the people is worth introducing and promoting.

### “新曲艺实验流动小组”

　　“新曲艺实验流动小组”
    张世楷
    为了执行文化部戏曲改进局一九五○年戏剧曲艺改革的方针与文化部春季开展文艺工作的指示，中国曲艺改进协会筹备委员会于今年三月底组成了“新曲艺实验流动小组”。小组的成员包括北京、保定、新乡等地的曲艺艺人十三名。它的目的是创造经验，培养艺人骨干，以改进曲艺，团结旧艺人为工农兵服务。目前的具体任务，是介绍新曲艺，向各地工人作示范演出，以鼓励并提高工人的生产热情，并随时搜集劳动英雄、生产模范的事迹，供给创作新曲艺唱词剧本的材料。他们演出的形式是多种多样的，有京韵、西河大鼓、单弦、河南坠子等，还配合着一些戏法与各种技艺杂耍。
    四月初，在铁路工会全国委员会的协助之下，这个小组先后曾赴京汉、京津两铁路沿线的保定、长辛店、丰台、黄村、北京等站演出。那些能够反映现阶段工人生活的新节目，普遍地受到工人的欢迎。例如鼓动生产热情的“好夫妻”、“大生产”；说明劳动人民伟大的“火车司机张福林”、“十女夸夫”等，工人们看后听后，都感到分外的亲切而深受感动。丰台机务段的工友们在意见簿上写道：“我们丰台机务段的工友是特别喜爱这种新型艺术的，希望新曲艺的同志们能经常来给我们演唱，借以提高我们的生产热情。在这三天的演唱中，我们认为成绩最突出的是魏炳山同志的“蒋介石卖国”，一种仇恨与愤怒的感情，使亲身受过压迫的工友起了共鸣，从仇恨的火海中，加强了我们战斗的决心。李德成同志的“好夫妻”，给了新的劳动态度以很适当的评价，演得又轻快又严肃。魏国良同志的“火车司机张福林”，演唱得逼真出神，表现了工人阶级的坚定信心……”这就是新曲艺在工人群众中的反映。
    五月初，这个流动小组又参加了铁路工会文教部所组成的文艺工作队，在天津路局各站、段、厂工作了整整一个月。他们的活动遍及各工厂、现场、车厢、票房、旅客歇息所以及各种群众集会的广场。由于曲艺是一种为广大劳动人民所熟悉的艺术，它普遍地受到各地工人群众的赞扬。为了使新曲艺能普遍深入民间，占领充满着封建迷信内容的旧曲艺所盘踞的广大阵地，必须要加强与各地旧艺人的联系，帮助他们进步。他们随着文艺工作队所到之处，就筹划召开新旧艺人联合座谈会，互相介绍材料，讨论旧曲艺的改进问题，给当地旧艺人指出了改进的道路。
    实验小组成立以来，他们与铁路工会和新华书店华北总分店采取“合作互惠”的方式，得到了很好的经验：
    实验小组帮助铁路工人搞起文娱工作，协助工会解决最感缺乏的文娱工作干部问题。另一方面，实验小组在铁路工会的帮助之下，解决了交通经费的困难。同时，他们更因此而得到了直接为工人服务的机会，与工人群众接近，锻炼自己，改造自己，进而了解工人的生活，收集材料，供给创作材料，以提高、丰富新曲艺的内容。
    实验小组又与新华书店合作，帮助书店向广大工农群众推销通俗书刊，并为书店张贴广告，宣传介绍工农读物。同时，实验小组还连带经销新曲艺普及本。在推销工作中，书店给他们一定的优待折扣。这样，就帮助实验小组部分地解决了经费问题。
    这种在同一的为人民服务的目标下，多方合作，互相协助的方式，是值得介绍推广的。
