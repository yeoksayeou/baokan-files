　　Tianjin Railway Fengtai Sections and Stations
    Jointly Establish Workers' Spare-Time Middle School
    [Report from this newspaper] Tianjin Railway Fengtai units have jointly established a workers' spare-time middle school. Preparations for the school began in early March, and the number of workers enrolling was extremely enthusiastic. After entrance examinations, 120 students were admitted, and classes officially began on April 13th. For over a month, the students' enthusiasm for learning has been extremely high, with daily attendance rates above 95 percent. The administrative departments of each station and section also value the students' learning, and everyone tries to avoid requiring them to work overtime, to ensure that their studies can proceed as planned.

    Most of the spare-time middle school students have a primary school graduation level of education, and some have even studied at the junior high school level for one or two years. The school is currently divided into six classes, with classes scheduled according to the students' work hours. The first class consists of 40 workers from the traffic, locomotive, engineering, telecommunications, and inspection sections, who all work day shifts. Their class time is scheduled from 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM every Monday through Friday. Workers from stations and other units who work two shifts are organized into two separate classes, studying on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays respectively, each class meeting for three days a week for two hours each day. Workers who work three shifts are divided into three classes, studying on Mondays and Thursdays, Tuesdays and Saturdays, and Wednesdays and Fridays respectively, each class meeting for two days a week, also for two hours each day. This arrangement allows workers in each class to continue studying in their original class after shift rotations.

    The current curriculum focuses on mathematics and physics/chemistry. The first class is scheduled to complete the upper and lower volumes of first-year junior high school arithmetic and the first volume of physics/chemistry within the first three-month semester. Starting in the second semester, they will begin studying junior high school algebra.

    The students have established a student association and formulated study discipline rules to democratically manage their learning. Many students have also established mutual aid agreements, promoting a spirit of friendship and mutual assistance to jointly ensure the completion of the study plan. Guarantee agreements have also been established between teachers and students, and between the student association and the school committee. Both teachers and students have high confidence in teaching and learning, and the students' progress has been significant. The first class held four exams in the first month. The average score of the first impromptu exam was 64.3, with five students scoring above 95 and thirteen failing. However, the average score of the fourth exam (monthly exam) increased to 81.75, with fifteen students scoring above 95 and only four failing. The average score of the first monthly exam for the other five classes reached 89.7. Although it is currently a busy period for summer production tasks, the students are able to overcome difficulties and persist in their studies.

　　天津铁路丰台各段站
    联合创办职工业余中学
    【本报讯】天津铁路丰台各单位，联合建立了职工业余中学一所。该校于三月初开始筹备，职工报名入学者极为踊跃。经入学考试后，录取了学员一百二十名，于四月十三日正式开课。月余来，学员们学习情绪极高，每天上课人数均在百分之九十五以上。各站段的行政方面也重视学员的学习，大家尽量避免要他们加班加点，以保证学习能够按计划进行。
    业余中学学员大部分有高小毕业文化程度，一部分并曾在初中肄业一、二年。全校现分六班，根据学员工作时间分别上课。第一班学员为车务、机务、工务、电务、检车各段的四十名工友，他们都是日班工作，上课时间规定在每晚七时半至九时，每周星期一至星期五学习。车站等单位的两班制工友，另编两班学习，各在星期一、三、五、和二、四、六分别上课，每周各上课三天，每天两小时。参加三班制工作的工友，则分编三个班，分在星期一、四、二、六和三、五各天上课，每周学习两天，每天亦为两小时。这样的编制，可使各班工友倒班后仍在原班继续学习。
    课程目前着重数学和理化。第一班预定在第一学期的三个月内把初中一年级算术的上下册和理化的第一册讲完，第二学期起开始学初中代数。
    学员们成立了学生会，制定了学习纪律，民主管理自己的学习。许多学员并订立了互助公条，发扬友爱互助的精神，共同保证学习计划的完成。师生之间，学生会与校委会之间，也都订立了保证公约。师生教与学的信心都很高，学员们进步很显著。第一班在第一个月中举行了四次考试，第一次临时考试平均分数是六十四点三分，九十五分以上者五人，十三人不及格；而第四次考试（月考）平均分数增至八十一点七五分，九十五分以上者达十五人，不及格者仅四人。其他五班第一次月考的平均成绩达八十九点七分。目前虽然是夏季生产任务的紧张期间，但学员们都能克服困难，坚持学习。
