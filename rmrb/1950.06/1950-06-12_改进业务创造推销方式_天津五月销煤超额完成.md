　　Improved Business Practices Create Sales Methods
    Tianjin Exceeds Coal Sales Target in May
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing and Tianjin branches of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company completed 99.56% of their monthly coal sales plan and 94.7% of their monetary recovery plan in May. Among them, the Tianjin branch completed 102.4%, the Beijing branch completed 91.61%, and the Tangshan branch completed 114.65%.
    The main reasons for completing the task this time are: simplified procedures, implementation of quota system, and the creation of new sales methods. For example, Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou have implemented joint office operations for business, warehouses, and cashiers. The Zhangjiakou branch has combined sales slips, stubs, weighbridge tickets, and gate passes together to facilitate customers' picking up goods, and most of them have achieved direct collection, eliminating the trouble for customers to pay at the bank. After the companies in Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou implemented the quota sales system, the sense of responsibility of the staff was greatly strengthened. For example, the Tianjin branch not only implemented quotas for salespersons, but also some personnel from other departments participated in sales work. For example, the accounting department of the branch sold 204 tons of coal within the month, and Tang Yuzhen, a comrade from the kitchen of the Lian San Factory, also took on the responsibility of selling three tons and sold six tons as a result. Another example is Comrade Lin Jiang from the Tangshan branch, who used his spare time after work to sell coal, selling a total of 2,000 tons in a month. Zhao Lianxun from the Zhangjiakou branch went to the countryside to promote sales and sold a total of 30 train cars of coal. The Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou branches also organized train transportation for sales, and the Tangshan branch organized mobile teams to go to the countryside, which were very effective and gave a strong guarantee for the completion of the task.
    There are still some shortcomings in the sales process. For example, the quota system has not yet been universally implemented; the work of going down to the streets and going to government organs has not been divided into regions, resulting in random encounters, which annoys customers and affects business; individual leading cadres still have a bureaucratic work style and have not gone to the lower levels to check and guide the work in a timely manner. These are the issues that should be paid attention to in future sales work.

　　改进业务创造推销方式
    天津五月销煤超额完成
    【本报讯】中国煤业建筑器材公司京、津分公司五月份完成全月销煤计划的百分之九九·五六，完成货币回笼计划的百分之九四·七。其中天津分公司完成百分之一○二·四，北京分公司完成百分之九一·六一，唐山支公司完成百分之一一四·六五。
    此次完成任务的主要原因是：简化了手续、实行定额制与创造了新的推销方式。如京、津、张家口都实行了业务、仓库及出纳员的联合办公，张市支公司并把售货单、存根、磅票、门票制在一起，便利了顾客取货，并大部分做到了直接收款，免去了顾客到银行交款的麻烦。津、唐、张等地公司实行定额销售制度后，大大加强了工作人员责任心，如天津分公司不仅业务员实行了定额，其他部门的人员也部分参加了推销工作。如该分公司会计科月内即卖出了二百零四吨煤，连三厂的伙房同志唐玉珍也认销三吨，结果售出六吨。又如唐山支公司林江同志利用下班后休息时间到外面卖煤，一月内共卖了两千吨。张市支公司赵连勋下乡推销，共售出煤三十火车。京、津、张分支公司并组织火车运销，唐山支公司组织机动小组下乡，均收效很大，给了完成任务很有力的保证。
    在推销中还存在着若干缺点。如定额制尚未普遍实行；在下街下机关工作中未划分地区，以致乱碰头，使顾主厌烦而影响了业务；个别单位的领导干部，还有官僚主义作风，未及时到下级去检查和指导工作。这是在今后推销工作中，应引起注意的。
