Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th. The Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Northeast People's Government, at a recent civil affairs conference, focused on reviewing the formalistic tendencies in convening people's representative conferences and proposed improvement measures.

According to reports from various regions: Since September of last year, the four provinces of Liaodong, Jilin, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang have successively held provincial people's representative conferences exercising the functions and powers of people's congresses; fifty-six cities throughout the region with populations over 30,000 have universally held two to five people's representative conferences, among which the people's representative conferences of eight cities, including Jilin, Changchun, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Qiqihar, Chengde, and Chifeng, exercised the functions and powers of city people's congresses; people's representative conference consultative committees have been established in Shenyang, Harbin, Andong, Jilin, Qiqihar, Jinzhou, Changchun, Jiamusi, Anshan, Fushun, Chengde, Fuxin and other cities. All one hundred and sixty-seven counties and banners (the Northeast has seven banners, equivalent to counties) in the Northeast region have universally convened two people's representative conferences, among which fifteen counties belonging to Liaodong and Rehe provinces exercised the functions and powers of county people's congresses. Among the one thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven districts in the region, one thousand five hundred and eighty-nine districts have held district people's representative conferences (of which three hundred and thirty-seven districts have held district people's congresses), accounting for 84.6 percent of the total number of districts in the Northeast region; among the thirty-one thousand four hundred and sixty-seven administrative villages in the region, twenty-two thousand five hundred and three villages have held village people's representative conferences (of which fourteen thousand one hundred and sixty-nine villages have held people's congresses), accounting for 71.5 percent of the total number of villages in the Northeast region.

The convening of people's representative conferences at all levels has played a considerable role in promoting government work and strengthening the connection between the government and the masses. The most significant aspect has been the implementation of the policy of developing production on the basis of extensively mobilizing the masses, solving a series of major problems existing in urban and rural production; educating government work cadres, overcoming certain bureaucratic work styles, and inspiring the enthusiasm of representatives and the masses, and strengthening the unity of all revolutionary classes.

However, due to the lack of leadership experience in many regions, especially the ambiguous understanding of people's representative conferences by some cadres, many shortcomings and deviations have also arisen, the main one being formalism. For example, a certain county in Songjiang Province made as many as 103 resolutions at one representative conference, the conference lacked a central focus, and most of the resolutions could not be implemented. Cadres in Niumaowu District of Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, adopted a perfunctory attitude towards people's representative conferences, and most of the representatives attending were working cadres, replacing the people's representative conference with a cadre meeting. Some local people's governments do not regard the work of convening people's representative conferences as a regular part of government work; cadres feel it is a burden, and the masses feel that it cannot solve problems. Some places did not conduct post-meeting communication, or only communicated the resolutions without earnestly implementing them. Some cities and counties have not yet established organizational structures for people's representative conference consultative committees, and those that have been established are mostly perfunctory and have not carried out regular work.

This civil affairs conference made a serious criticism of the above shortcomings, and emphasized that in order to lead the work of people's representative conferences at all levels well in the future, it is first necessary to raise the understanding of people's representative conferences among working cadres and resolutely change erroneous attitudes and working methods. Second, it is necessary to conduct careful preparations before the meeting, and determine the central topics of the meeting based on the current work policy and the greatest demands of the local people. The meeting should fully promote democracy, humbly listen to the opinions of representatives from all walks of life, and practically solve problems – mainly solving production problems. Third, it is necessary to implement the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and use this as one of the main tasks of the meeting, so as to further strengthen the connection between the government and the people. Fourth, it is necessary to effectively organize post-meeting communication, mobilize the masses to implement the resolutions, and conduct timely supervision and inspection. In the implementation of the resolutions, attention should be paid to giving play to the exemplary and bridging roles of the representatives.

The conference also emphasized that people's governments at all levels should further consolidate the people's representative conferences, earnestly implement the various provisions of the Central People's Government's Organizational Rules for People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in Provinces, Cities, and Counties, and convene meetings regularly. Each province, city, and county should establish people's representative conference consultative committees to play their role in assisting the government and promoting work.

### 纠正若干地区人民代表会议的形式主义偏向  东北民政会议决定改进办法

　　纠正若干地区人民代表会议的形式主义偏向
    东北民政会议决定改进办法
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北人民政府民政部在最近召开的民政会议上，着重检讨了召开人民代表会议中的形式主义偏向，并提出了改进办法。
    据各地汇报：自去年九月以来，辽东、吉林、松江、黑龙江四省已先后开过代行人民代表大会职权的省人民代表会议；全境五十六个三万人口以上的城市普遍开了二次到五次人民代表会议，其中吉林、长春、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、齐齐哈尔、承德、赤峰八个市的人民代表会议代行了市人民代表大会职权；沈阳、哈尔滨、安东、吉林、齐齐哈尔、锦州、长春、佳木斯、鞍山、抚顺、承德、阜新等市均成立了市人民代表会议协商委员会。东北全区一百六十七个县、旗（按东北有七个旗，等于县），已普遍召开了两次人民代表会议，其中辽东、热河省属的十五个县代行了县人民代表大会职权。全境一千八百八十七个区中，有一千五百八十九个区开过了区人民代表会议（其中三百三十七个区开了区人民代表大会），占东北地区区总数的百分之八十四点六；全境三万一千四百六十七个行政村中，有二万二千五百零三个村开过村人民代表会议（其中一万四千一百六十九个村开了人民代表大会），占东北地区村总数的百分之七十一点五。
    各级人民代表会议的召开，对于推动政府工作，密切政府与人民群众的联系，都起了相当的作用。最显著的就是在广泛发动群众的基础上，贯彻了发展生产的政策，解决了城市和农村生产上所存在的一系列的重大的问题；教育了政府工作干部，克服了某些官僚主义作风，并启发了代表和群众的积极性，增强了各革命阶级的团结。
    但由于许多地区的领导经验不足，特别是某些干部对各界人民代表会议的认识模糊，也产生了不少缺点和偏向，其中主要的是形式主义。如松江省某县在一次代表会议上竟作了一百零三条决议，会议漫无中心，决议大多无法贯彻。辽东省宽甸县牛毛坞区的干部对人民代表会议采取应付态度，出席代表大都是工作干部，以干部会代替了人民代表会议。有的地方人民政府不把召开人民代表会议的工作作为政府的经常工作，干部觉得是个负担，群众认为不能解决问题。有的地方在会后并未进行传达，或只传达而未认真执行决议。有些市县至今尚未建立人民代表会议协商委员会的组织机构，已建立的也多流于形式，没有展开经常工作。
    这次民政会议对上述缺点作了严肃的批判，并着重指出：今后要领导好各级人民代表会议的工作，第一必须提高工作干部对人民代表会议的认识，坚决改变错误的态度与工作方法。第二要在会前认真地进行准备，根据当前工作的方针和当地人民的最大要求，确定会议的中心课题。会上要充分发扬民主，虚心倾听各界代表的意见，切实地解决问题——主要是解决生产问题。第三要贯彻批评与自我批评的精神，并以此作为会议的主要任务之一，以便进一步密切政府与人民的联系。第四要切实组织会后传达，发动群众执行决议，并按时督促检查。在贯彻执行决议中，要注意发挥代表的模范作用与桥梁作用。
    会议并强调指出：各级人民政府要进一步将人民代表会议巩固起来，认真执行中央人民政府关于省、市、县各界人民代表会议组织通则的各项规定，定期召开会议。各省、市、县均应分别成立各界人民代表会议协商委员会，发挥其协助政府与推动工作的作用。
