　　Congratulations to the Beijing Municipal Literary Congress
　　Yu Pingbo

　　Beijing has been a famous capital throughout dynasties. The establishment of the Central People's Government on October 1st last year, with Beijing as its capital, has a profound and significant meaning. It not only sounded the clarion call of a new China but also fully demonstrated Beijing's new atmosphere and bright prospects. Furthermore, since the CCP Central Committee moved here, although Beiping was not yet renamed, it was in fact the people's capital. In July last year, the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers was held, which was a brand-new record in the history of literary and artistic development, and it is no exaggeration to call it unprecedented. The National Federation of Literary and Art Circles was born from the Congress, and under its leadership, regional branches have been successively organized throughout the country. Since our Beijing has become the people's capital! To put it bluntly, it is the "model area", and it should quickly organize the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Therefore, the convening of this Beijing Municipal Literary Congress has a very clear task: first, to bring together many representative literary and art workers to make this congress a success. Second, to efficiently organize the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles and clearly define its future work direction. I believe that with so many friends gathered together, we will surely be able to complete it victoriously.

　　To congratulate this Beijing Municipal Literary Congress, there are quite a few things to say. It cannot be said that China's past literature and art did not have high achievements; this is beyond doubt. Apart from the progressive literature and art of the time, most of the literature and art served the reactionary ruling class. Even if they did not want to serve it, at least the fruits of literature and art were mostly snatched, swallowed whole, and squandered by the people of the ruling class. I often have a wild idea that all genuine literature and art are enlightened, progressive, and for the people. Conversely, if it is not enlightened, not progressive, and not for the people, it must be a counterfeit. However, there is one point: that is, true literature and art have various differences in their composition, differences in the degree of depth, differences in the expression of light and darkness, and differences in the strength of individuality. Therefore, we must use the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism to critically accept it, on the one hand, to find out its significance in that era, and at the same time, restore its original appearance. This work sounds easy, but it is very difficult to do. Although it is difficult, this account must be settled in the end. Otherwise, our new literature and art will have no roots and will not be easily welcomed by the workers, peasants, and masses.

　　For thousands of years, feudal society had a common pattern, that is, the ruling class was hostile to the people. Therefore, literary and art workers at that time had to please the current dignitaries, that is, they had to distort their legitimate positions and surrender to evil forces. If they had the intention to express the suffering of the people and promote their sense of justice, they could not but, to a greater or lesser extent, openly or secretly, betray the ruling class. The choice had to be made between the two, which was another dilemma, so their psychology was always contradictory, wavering, and painful. From now on, however, there is a right-angle turn, which is fundamentally different from the past. The government is the people's, and the people must support the government. However, the old ideas have accumulated deeply enough, and the situation has changed too suddenly. I am afraid that some people in the society cannot fully grasp this new viewpoint. This must be strived for slowly with facts and other methods.

　　Our literary and art workers no longer have to make a living in the cracks, and naturally feel infinite ease and joy, but the old baggage is not easy to discard, and at the same time, they feel that the new burden is very heavy. Even if there are correct viewpoints and positions, it is useless without work. Looking at it from one's own position, it is particularly difficult to use words as a medium to exert its popularization function than to rely on sounds, colors, shapes, etc. We must also strive to overcome it.

　　Our literature and art are very broad, including traditional classical literature and art, Europeanized new literature and art since the May Fourth Movement, and people's literature and art that have been liberated and grown locally. The convening of this Beijing Municipal Literary Congress is really to combine these three aspects and further point out the correct direction for future development. Representatives, friends, what an inspiring event this is. We should confidently wish it success. I grew up in Jiangnan, and I have been living in Beijing as a sojourner for more than thirty years. I am fortunate to be able to participate in this meeting. I am not only very happy, but also feel that I am also a Beijinger.

### 祝京市文代会

　　祝京市文代会
    俞平伯
    北京是历代的名都，去年十月一日中央人民政府成立，定都北京，这意义是深长重大的。它不但吹响了新生中国的号角，并且充分表现出北京新生的气象和光明的前景。再说，自中共中央移到这儿以来，那时北平虽未改名，事实上已为人民的首都了。在去年七月间开了中华全国文代大会，这是文艺发展史上的崭新纪录，誉为空前毫不夸大。从文代大会中即产生了全国文联，又在它领导下，全国各地已将次第组织区域性的分会。咱们北京既成为人民的首都！说句老话，即“首善之区”，自更应当赶快把本市文联组织起来。所以这次北京市文代会的召开，它的工作原十分明白：第一，集合许多有代表性的文艺工作者把这大会开好。第二，有效率的把这市文联组织好，更把它以后工作的路线明确地规定了。我相信，有这许多朋友们聚首一堂，必然能够胜利完成的。
    为这京市的文代会致祝，却也很有些话好说。咱们中国以往的文艺不能说没有很高的造诣，这无可疑惑的。除当时的进步文艺外，一般的文艺都是为反动统治阶级服务的，即不想为它服务，至少文艺的果实也多被统治阶级的人们抢来吃了，囫囵吞了，糟践了。我常怀着一个妄念，觉得所有货真价实的文艺，没有不是开明的，前进的，为人民的。反过来说，假如它不开明，不前进，不为人民，那必是冒牌。不过却有一层，即为真实的文艺，成份亦有种种差别，程度有深浅之别，表现有明暗之异，个性有强弱之分，所以我们必须用马列主义的观点批判地去接受它，一面找出在那时代的意义，同时也还它一个本来面目。这工作说来容易，做却很难。虽然很难，但这本帐总归是要结的。不然，咱们的新文艺便没有根，也就不易为工农大众所喜闻乐见。
    几千年来封建社会有一公共的格局，即统治阶级跟人民敌对。所以当时文艺工作者要讨好当前的权贵，即不能不歪曲了自己的正当立场，向恶势力投降。如有心申说人民的痛苦，发扬自己的正义感，亦不能不多多少少或明或暗，叛变了这统治阶级。二者必取其一，又是两难，所以他们的心理始终是矛盾的，动摇的，痛苦的，从今以后呵，却直角地拐弯，和以前根本不同了，政府是人民的，人民必须拥护政府。然而旧的观念积得实在够深，形势变化亦太骤，社会上恐怕还有些人不容易充分把捉这新观点，这必须用事实和其他的种种方法慢慢地去争取。
    我们文艺工作者不必再在夹缝里讨生活，自然觉得无限的轻松愉快，可是旧的包袱不太容易抛弃同时又感到新的肩担非常重大。就算有了正确的观点跟立场，没有工作也是枉然。再从自己的岗位上看，用文字来做媒介要发挥它的普及功能，比依靠声音颜色形状等等特别困难。我们也必须努力去克服它。
    我们的文学艺术原是很广大的，有传统的古典文艺，有五四以来的欧化新文艺，有解放出来的土生土长的人民文艺，这次北京市文代会的召开，实在要把这三方面都结合起来，进一步指明以后发展的正确方向。代表们，朋友们，这是多么令人感奋的一桩大事。我们应该有信心地预祝它的成功。我生长江南，在北京为侨寓，却不知不觉已过了三十多年，侥幸能参加这个会，不但很快活，而且觉得我也算个北京人了。
         一九五○年五月二十五日
