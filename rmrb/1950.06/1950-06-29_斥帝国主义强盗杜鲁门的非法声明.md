Denounce Truman's Illegal Statement, the Imperialist Robber

U.S. President Truman issued a statement on June 27, announcing intervention in the Korean civil war, supporting the South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet group, which first launched the offensive and was in danger under the North Korean counterattack; announcing increased military aid to the Philippine Quirino government and the Vietnamese Bao Dai government; and at the same time announcing naval control of Taiwan, believing that "the determination of Taiwan's future status must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations." All of this is an imperialist act of aggression that blatantly violates the United Nations Charter, interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, and undermines the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of other countries.

Truman's statement on Taiwan directly violates the declaration of the Cairo Conference of December 1, 1943, by the United States, Britain, and China, which clearly announced that territories such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands seized by Japan from China should be returned to China. Truman's statement directly violates the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, by the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union on urging Japan to surrender, which stipulated that the terms of the Cairo Declaration must be implemented. Truman's statement directly violates the fact that Taiwan has long been recognized by the world, including the United States, as having been returned to our country after Japan surrendered, and even directly violates Truman's own special statement on the Taiwan issue on January 5, 1950. Truman himself said on January 5:

"The traditional policy of the United States toward China can be exemplified by the Open Door Policy, which calls for international respect for China's territorial integrity. This principle was reaffirmed by the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 8 last year. That resolution requires all countries not to (1) acquire spheres of influence or establish regimes controlled by foreign forces within Chinese territory; (2) pursue special rights or privileges within Chinese territory. The above principles apply particularly to Taiwan in the current situation. In the Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the Chairman of China stated their purpose: that territories taken by Japan from China, such as Taiwan, should be returned to China. The United States is a signatory to the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945. The Potsdam Declaration stated that the terms of the Cairo Declaration should be implemented immediately. Japan also accepted the provisions of this declaration upon surrender. In order to implement the above declarations, Taiwan was handed over to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The United States and other Allied countries have also recognized China's exercise of power over the island for the past four years. The United States has never had any ambition to plunder Taiwan or other Chinese territories. The United States has no intention of acquiring special rights or privileges or establishing military bases in Taiwan now. The United States does not intend to use armed forces to interfere in its current situation, and the United States government does not intend to follow any path that would involve the United States in China's internal strife. Similarly, the United States government does not intend to provide military assistance or advice to the Chinese troops in Taiwan."

Truman's statement of January 5 was reaffirmed by the U.S. Department of State on February 5, and as late as the 23rd of this month, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson stated that Truman's statement of January 5 was valid. Now Truman has proven himself to be a liar on January 5 and a robber on June 27.

Truman wants to use the situation in Korea as an excuse, but this is not enough to defend the United States' actions, but is enough to prove that the outbreak of the Korean civil war was a predetermined step by American imperialism. What does Taiwan have to do with Korea? What does Korea have to do with the United States? The South Korean puppet had already clamored for the so-called "Northern Expedition," and after U.S. Secretary of State's special advisor Dulles visited South Korea from the 17th to the 21st of this month, and U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley visited Japan from the 18th to the 23rd of this month, the war immediately broke out; the United States immediately announced armed intervention in South Korea, armed intervention in Taiwan, and strengthened military assistance to the reactionary governments of the Philippines and Vietnam. It can be seen that Syngman Rhee's challenge on June 25 was merely to find an excuse for a series of aggressive actions by the United States.

In his statement, Truman also mentioned the so-called resolution of the United Nations Security Council. However, the Security Council without the participation of Chinese and Soviet representatives, of course, cannot produce any legitimate resolution. In fact, the United States has already torn up the United Nations Charter with its own aggressive actions and used the Security Council as its own toy. But even this Security Council has not asked Truman to publicly take the Hitlerian steps of the 27th. Obviously, whoever is faithful to the United Nations should stand up to sanction the United States government, the destroyer of the United Nations.

American aggression is already disrupting peace in the Far East and threatening world peace. But American aggression must be and can be repelled.

The Chinese people will never recognize any statement or action by Truman and other American robbers regarding Taiwan as valid. Taiwan was, is, and will continue to be the legal territory of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people will continue to work to liberate Taiwan and will surely be able to expel the American aggressors and liberate Taiwan.

The Chinese people also do not consider the actions of American imperialism on June 27 to be anything to be afraid of. The actions of the United States have not strengthened the aggressive camp, but weakened it. Imperialist robbers always want to expand their aggression, but the more they expand their aggression, the closer they get to their doomsday. Japanese imperialism's aggression against China and Southeast Asia proved this, and German imperialism's aggression against Europe and the Soviet Union also proved this. The American robbers have now made enemies on all sides and cannot extricate themselves. Since American imperialism has forced the Korean people, the Chinese people, the Filipino people, the Vietnamese people, and the Japanese people to openly and directly fight against American armed aggression, it cannot but make itself more isolated, more passive, and more exposed to and deeply mired in the great net of the Eastern national struggle, and cannot but get closer to its own doomsday. The oppressed people of the East, final victory is ours, strive forward! The sympathy of the people of the world is on our side, and not on the side of American imperialism.

### 斥帝国主义强盗杜鲁门的非法声明

　　斥帝国主义强盗杜鲁门的非法声明
    美国总统杜鲁门在六月二十七日发表声明，宣布干涉朝鲜内战，支持首先发动进攻而在北朝鲜反攻下陷于危险状况的南朝鲜李承晚傀儡集团；宣布加强对菲律宾季里诺政府和越南保大政府的军事援助；同时宣布以海军控制台湾，认为“台湾未来地位的决定，必须等待太平洋安全的恢复，对日和约的缔结，或联合国的考虑”。所有这一切，都是横暴地违反联合国宪章、干涉他国内政、破坏他国领土完整主权独立的帝国主义侵略行为。
    杜鲁门对于台湾的声明，直接违反美英中三国一九四三年十二月一日关于开罗会议的宣言，这个宣言明白宣布满洲台湾澎湖等日本所窃取于中国之领土归还中国。杜鲁门声明直接违反美英中苏四国一九四五年七月二十六日关于促令日本投降的波茨坦公告，这个公告规定开罗宣言的条款必将实施。杜鲁门声明直接违反全世界包括美国所久已公认的台湾已在日本实行投降以后归还我国的事实，甚至直接违反杜鲁门自己在一九五○年一月五日关于台湾问题的专门声明。杜鲁门自己在一月五日说：
    “美国对中国的传统政策可以门户开放政策为例证，要求国际上尊重中国的领土完整。这一原则为联合国大会去年十二月八日通过的决议案予以重申。该案要求一切国家不得（一）在中国领土内获取势力范围，建立由外力控制的政权；（二）在中国领土内追求特别权益或特权。上述原则在目前的局势下对台湾特别适用。在一九四三年十二月一日的开罗宣言中美国总统、英国首相及中国主席曾申明他们的目的是：日本自中国夺去的领土如台湾应归还中国。美国是一九四五年七月二十六日波茨坦宣言的签字国。波茨坦宣言称：开罗宣言条款应即执行。日本于投降时亦曾接受此宣言的规定。为实践以上各项宣言，台湾即交给蒋介石委员长。过去四年来美国及其他盟国亦承认中国得对该岛行使权力。美国对台湾或中国其他领土从无掠夺的野心。现在美国亦无意在台湾获取特别权益或特权或建立军事基地。美国亦不拟使用武装部队干预其现在的局势，美国政府不拟遵循任何足以把美国卷入中国内争中的途径。同样地美国政府也不拟对在台湾的中国军队供给军事援助或咨询。”
    杜鲁门一月五日的声明，曾被美国国务院在二月五日加以重申，直至本月二十三日，美国国务卿艾奇逊还声明杜鲁门一月五日声明的有效。现在杜鲁门证明了自己在一月五日是一个骗子，而在六月二十七日是一个强盗。
    杜鲁门想拿朝鲜的形势来做借口，但是这不但不足以辩护美国的行动，适足以证明朝鲜内战的爆发是美国帝国主义的预定步骤。台湾和朝鲜有什么相干？朝鲜和美国又有什么相干？南朝鲜的傀儡早已叫嚣所谓“北伐”，而在美国国务卿特别顾问杜勒斯本月十七日至二十一日访问了南朝鲜，美国国防部长詹逊、参谋长会议主席布莱德雷本月十八日至二十三日访问了日本以后，战争就紧跟着爆发了；美国紧跟着就宣布武装干涉南朝鲜，武装干涉台湾，并加强对于菲律宾和越南的反动政府的军事援助。由此可见，李承晚在六月二十五日的挑战，不过是为美国一连串侵略行动寻找一个借口罢了。
    杜鲁门在声明中还提到所谓联合国安理会的决议。但是没有中苏两国代表出席的安理会，当然不能产生任何合法的决议。事实上，美国已经用自己的侵略行动把联合国宪章撕毁了，并且利用安理会作为自己的玩具。但是甚至这个安理会，也没有要求杜鲁门公开采取二十七日的希特勒式的步骤。很明显，谁要是忠实于联合国，谁就应当起来制裁联合国的破坏者美国政府。
    美国的侵略已经在破坏着远东的和平，并且在威胁着世界的和平。但是美国的侵略是必须击退和可以击退的。
    中国人民绝不认为杜鲁门和其他美国强盗对于台湾的任何声明和任何行动为有效。台湾过去是、现在是、将来仍然是中华人民共和国的合法领土。中国人民必将继续努力以解放台湾，并且必能驱逐美国侵略者而解放台湾。
    中国人民也绝不认为美国帝国主义六月二十七日的行动有什么可怕。美国的行动并没有加强侵略阵营，反而是削弱了它。帝国主义强盗总是要扩大侵略的，但是他们愈扩大侵略，就愈接近于末日。日本帝国主义侵略中国和南洋证明了这一点，德国帝国主义侵略欧洲和苏联也证明了这一点。美国强盗现在已经四面树敌，不能自拔。美国帝国主义既然迫使朝鲜人民、中国人民、菲律宾人民、越南人民、日本人民公开地直接地向美国武装侵略作斗争，就不能不使自己更加孤立，更加被动，更加暴露于并深陷于伟大的东方民族斗争的天罗地网中间，就不能不更加接近于自己的末日。东方的被压迫人民，最后胜利是我们的，努力前进啊！全世界人民的同情都在我们方面，而不在美国帝国主义方面。
