　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 29th: The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 28th entitled "Americans Gone Berserk," stating: The Americans are now attempting to conduct a large-scale and cruel massacre of civilians in North and South Korea in order to reverse the situation to favor their puppets and turn the entire Korean peninsula into a base against neighboring countries—China and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the American hooligans provoked the war in Korea to find themselves a pathetic excuse to protect the Chiang Kai-shek regime on Taiwan Island, a group of puppets whose fate is sealed. The claim that these actions are taken after being approved by the United Nations is a brazen lie. The Americans and their vassals have turned the once-respected United Nations Security Council into a discredited body controlled by the United States, similar to the "Rump Parliament" in British history. Unless all permanent members are present and agree, any decision of this body is not legal, and currently the Soviet Union is outside the Security Council because Chiang Kai-shek and his gang continue to be recognized as the government of China. The Security Council, which routinely raised its hands on the evening of the 27th to pass U.S. resolutions, is not a real Security Council.

　　The British people must demand that British soldiers, sailors, or airmen not be used to carry out this U.S. war plan. The British people must force the government to change its policy and oppose U.S. war plans in the United Nations and elsewhere. Frankly, the presence of American aggressor air forces in Britain is an insult and a threat to the British people. The British people must demand that the U.S. Air Force immediately leave British territory to demonstrate their will to fight for peace and national independence.

　　The "Daily Worker" also published an editorial on the Korean issue on the 27th, entitled "Don't Be Fooled." The editorial said: Since the overthrow of Chiang Kai-shek, the United States has been looking for an excuse to take aggressive action in the Far East. They will use the war they provoked in Korea as an excuse to suppress the strength of the Japanese people and implement their plan to turn the country into a war base. The British people have no desire to help American imperialism and its puppets destroy the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and restore capitalism, the landlord system, and a thoroughly corrupt government in North Korea. The British people cannot agree to the American imperialists claiming they have the right to establish bases on the borders of the Soviet Union and China. Let's look at the map: Korea, thousands of miles from the United States, cannot be a base for defending the United States, but a base from which the United States can launch attacks against the Soviet Union and China. The British people will never help the Americans in their attempt to conquer all of Korea for such a purpose. The threat to peace will surely arouse a powerful counterattack from all progressive humanity.

### 英工人日报发表社论  痛斥美帝侵略朝鲜  社论号召反对美国战争计划

　　英工人日报发表社论
    痛斥美帝侵略朝鲜
    社论号召反对美国战争计划
    【新华社布拉格二十九日电】伦敦工人日报二十八日以《美国人发了杀人狂》为题发表社论称：美国人现在企图对朝鲜北部和南部的平民进行大规模残酷的屠杀，以便扭转形势，使其有利于他们的傀儡，并把整个朝鲜变成一个针对邻国——中国和苏联——的基地。此外，美国流氓们在朝鲜挑起战争，是为了给他们自己找寻一个可怜的借口，来保护他们躲在台湾岛上的蒋介石政权那一群命运被注定了的傀儡。那种所谓这些行动是经联合国批准后而采取的说法，真是厚颜无耻的谎话。美国人和他们的附庸们，把一度受人尊重的联合国安理会弄成了美国控制下威信扫地的，类似英国历史上那种尾闾国会之类的东西了。除非各个常任理事国都出席并表示同意，否则这个机构的任何决定都不是合法的，而目前苏联却在安理会之外，因为蒋介石和他那匪帮继续被承认为中国政府。那个在二十七日晚上照例举手通过美国决定的安理会，并不是真正的安理会。
    英国人民一定要要求不许利用英国士兵、水兵或空军来实行美国的这一个战争计划。英国人民必须迫使政府改变他的政策，在联合国和其他地方反对美国的战争计划。老实说，美国侵略者的空军驻扎在英国，是对英国人民的侮辱和威胁。英国人民必须要求美国空军立即离开英国领土，以表现他们争取和平与国家独立的意志。
    工人日报二十七日也发表了关于朝鲜问题的社论，题为《不要受骗》，社论说：自从蒋介石被推翻以来，美国一直在找对远东采取侵略行动的借口。他们将利用他们自己在朝鲜挑起的战争，来作为镇压日本人民力量的口实，并推行其将这个国家变成战争基地的计划。英国人民丝毫不愿去帮助美帝国主义和它的傀儡去摧残朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，以及在北朝鲜恢复资本主义、地主制度和腐败透顶的政府。英国人民不能同意美帝国主义者自命他们有权在苏联和中国边境建立基地的要求。我们且看看地图，距美国数千英里的朝鲜，不可能是一个保卫美国的基地，而是一个美国能用以向苏联和中国发动进攻的基地。英国人民决不帮助美国人为了这样一种目的而征服全朝鲜的图谋。对和平的威胁一定会唤起全体进步人类作强有力的反击。
