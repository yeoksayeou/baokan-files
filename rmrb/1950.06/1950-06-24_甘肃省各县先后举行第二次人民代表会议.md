Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 23rd: With the exception of a few counties like Zhuoni and Xiahe, all other counties in Gansu Province have successively convened their second county-level People's Representative Conferences. Due to the importance attached to this work by the People's Governments of each county, and the relatively thorough preparations made before the conferences, along with timely exchange of opinions with people from all walks of life, the second conferences have achieved greater results than the first. At the second People's Representative Conferences held in various counties, the heads of the People's Governments of each county earnestly reported on their work, conducted self-criticism, and, based on the characteristics of each locality and the urgent demands of the people, put forward central topics for discussion. In ethnic minority areas, the conferences focused on discussing the strengthening of ethnic unity and the restoration and development of production; in general new areas, they discussed issues such as production, disaster relief, and the suppression of bandits, and all made resolutions.

In Jiuquan, Zhangye, Wuwei, Linxia, Dingxi, Tianshui, Qingyang and other places, as well as Lanzhou City, the People's Governments, through the publicity and efforts of representatives of the people, mobilized people of all ethnic groups to lend each other more than 80,000 shi of grain, exceeding the total amount of government loans by more than 30%, which solved the difficulties faced by farmers in the province during spring plowing. After the People's Representative Conference of Jingning County passed a resolution on bandit suppression, the representatives immediately conducted extensive publicity among the masses, and through relatives and friends, called back many farmers who had been deceived by bandits and special agents and were wandering outside to return home for production. Because the conferences fully promoted democracy, inspected and promoted the work of the government, the representatives have realized from the facts that the People's Representative Conferences are meetings to "manage their own affairs well," thereby dispelling the various concerns that existed before. Government workers, after the People's Representative Conferences, also experienced the significant role of the conferences in promoting various tasks. The second People's Representative Conference of Linxia County commended the representatives who performed the best in implementing the resolutions after the first representative conference, thus further encouraging all the representatives who participated in the second conference.

　　甘肃省各县先后举行第二次人民代表会议
    【新华社西安二十三日电】甘肃省各县除卓尼、夏河等少数县份外，均已先后召开了第二次县各界人民代表会议。由于各县人民政府重视这一工作，在会前做了比较充分的准备，及时与各界人士交换意见，第二次会议较第一次会议获得更多的成效。在各县所举行的第二次各界人民代表会议上，各县人民政府的负责人均认真地向代表报告了工作，进行了检讨，并根据各地的特点和人民的迫切要求，提出了中心的议题。在民族聚居地区，各界代表会议着重讨论了加强民族团结和恢复、发展生产的问题；在一般新区，则讨论了生产、救灾、剿匪等问题，都制成决议。
    酒泉、张掖、武威、临夏、定西、天水、庆阳等地和兰州市，人民政府即通过各界人民代表的宣传和努力，发动各族人士互相借粮达八万多石，比政府贷粮总数超过百分之三十，解决了该省农民在春耕生产中的困难。静宁县各界人民代表会议通过剿匪的议案后，代表们立即在群众中进行了广泛的宣传，并经过亲戚朋友关系，叫回不少受土匪特务欺骗而流落在外的农民回家生产。由于会议充分发扬了民主，检查并推进了政府的工作，代表们已从事实上体会到各界人民代表会议是“办好自己的事情”的会议，从而打消了以前所存在的各种顾虑。政府工作人员在人民代表会议之后，也体验了会议对推动各种工作的重大作用。临夏县第二次人民代表会议表扬了第一次代表会议后执行决议最好的代表，因此更加鼓舞了第二次参加会议的全体代表。
