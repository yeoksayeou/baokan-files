　　Soviet Enterprise Managers and Party Organizations
    Ni. Vonarev

    The manager is the fully empowered leader of a state enterprise. His orders and instructions must be unconditionally executed by all his subordinates and cannot be changed by anyone other than the manager himself and the higher economic organs. The state entrusts him with full power to lead the enterprise; he defines the tasks of his subordinates, handles finances and all materials, and is personally fully responsible for the results of his operations. The basic task of an economic leader is to complete the missions assigned by the state in a timely manner and to manage all affairs in the enterprise with the attitude of a master.

    The Party organization is also closely concerned with the improvement of the enterprise's work and is responsible for doing its best to help the economic leader accomplish this task. The Party Constitution empowers the Party organization to supervise the administrative authorities of the enterprise in managing the enterprise. However, the Party organization and its leaders do not have administrative power and should not interfere in the administrative work; they are neither allowed to monopolize nor to take over the work. The Party organization is the basic force for mobilizing and organizing the masses in its own enterprise, and it is the political leader. Its task is to carry out propaganda and organizational work among the masses to implement the Party's calls and decisions, mobilize all employees of the enterprise to complete the production plan, strengthen labor discipline, develop the socialist emulation movement, conduct political education for workers and staff, constantly care about improving their cultural welfare, and supervise the enterprise's compliance with the interests of the state.

    In order to lead the enterprise smoothly, the actions of the administrative organs and the Party organization must be combined consistently, and a working relationship must be maintained between the Party Committee and the manager. Without the support of activists and the Party organization, it is impossible for the manager to lead the enterprise successfully. For example, if a manager wants to implement a certain method, can he achieve the desired effect if he does not mobilize the strength of the entire collective? Of course not. Orders must be carried out by everyone, so the help of the Party organization becomes absolutely necessary.

    An economic leader who does not rely on Party activists and the Party organization, does not adopt collective opinions, and does not listen to the voices of the masses is the worst kind of leader.

    In his report to the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Comrade Zhdanov, when talking about managers who attempt to lead enterprises without relying on Party organizations, believed that these people did not understand the system of one-man responsibility at all. He said: "Our Soviet, Bolshevik system of one-man responsibility means being good at managing, good at organizing affairs, selecting cadres, making correct instructions, demanding summaries, and eliminating irresponsibility and evasion of responsibility. But at the same time, it also means being good at relying on the Party organization, relying on activists in the enterprise, and relying on the entire mass of people in the enterprise in this work."

    The Party Constitution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) empowers the Party organizations in production departments to supervise the administrative authorities of the enterprise in managing the enterprise. This right means that the Party organization can at any time understand the settlement reports and other documents showing the current state of the enterprise's production and financial and economic affairs, listen to the reports of economic leaders at Party congresses and meetings, raise issues concerning production shortcomings and slackness to the enterprise's administrative authorities, and suggest ways to eliminate these phenomena, and report the enterprise's current situation to higher authorities, etc.

    Using these rights, the Party organization can influence the enterprise's production work operationally. Under normal mutual relations between the leaders of the enterprise and the Party organization, the manager's prestige will not be damaged in the slightest. On the contrary, the supervisory power is to make the Party organization responsible for adopting various methods to consolidate the system of one-man responsibility and support the authority of the manager.

    The Party organization has no right to force the manager—an economic leader—to do things that he does not agree with and that are within the scope of his authority as the one person responsible. The Party organization has no right to cancel any disciplinary orders of the manager. When necessary, it only has the right to protest the manager's actions to the higher Party organization. The Party Committee cannot issue any instructions related to production work, or require the economic leader to discuss his disciplinary actions and orders with the Party organization. It also has no right to remove, appoint, or transfer staff, or to infringe upon the inherent powers of the enterprise's administrative authorities. The Party organization should not mix its leadership into operational and economic work; its leadership of the enterprise is different from that of the manager, and it is to ensure the smooth implementation of the Party's calls and instructions.

    Party work cannot be separated from production tasks. Comrade Stalin teaches us that economics and politics are inseparable, and economic achievements and their consolidation and sustainability depend entirely on the level of Party political work.

    In essence, Party supervision is social and mass supervision. Its strength lies in this. The more people who participate in supervision, the more effective and impactful this supervision will be. A Party Committee alone, especially not just the secretary of a Party Committee, cannot understand everything that happens in an enterprise. The situation is completely different if Party members participate in Party supervision. The most important and commonly used methods of Party supervision are to discuss the reports of enterprise managers at Party member meetings, political bureau meetings, and committee meetings. Making detailed preliminary checks on the reports, conducting extensive discussions based on Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, and making concrete resolutions—all of these not only increase the economic leader's sense of responsibility for the enterprise's work, but also increase the Party organization's and every Party member's sense of responsibility for the enterprise's work.

    Other methods can also be adopted, such as the Party Committee taking the initiative to convene work meetings and production meetings on a regular basis: technical meetings, regular gatherings of Stakhanovite workers, and engineering and technical workers. At the same time, the Party organization must develop and support criticism from below, support all legitimate suggestions, and do its best to promote their implementation.

    Correctly implemented Party supervision, sharp criticism of shortcomings in enterprise leadership, will not only not undermine the system of one-man responsibility and the prestige of economic leaders, but will rather consolidate them. An enterprise manager who is willing to rely on the Party organization and the collective of the masses should accept criticism in a Bolshevik manner and should deeply examine himself, without fearing that Party supervision and criticism will lower his prestige. The Party organization's instructions are aimed at improving the enterprise's work; and the growth of the enterprise will also help to boost the prestige of the economic leader.

　　苏维埃企业的经理与党的组织
    尼·沃那列夫
    经理是国家企业的全权领导者。他的命令和指示都必须由其所有的下属人员无条件地执行，除了经理本人和上级经济机关之外，任何人不得加以变更。国家委任他全权领导企业，他规定下属人员的任务，处理财政与一切物资，对其经营事业的结果由他个人担负着全部责任。经济领导者的基本任务，乃是及时完成国家所赋予的使命和以主人翁的地位掌管企业中的一切事务。
    党组织也密切地关怀着企业工作的改进，并负有尽力帮助经济领导者达成这种任务的责任。党章赋予党组织以监督企业行政当局管理事业之权。但是党组织及其领导者并没有行政管理权，也不应干涉到行政管理的业务工作中去，既不许把持，也不许包办代替。党组织在自己的企业中是动员与组织群众的基本力量，是政治上的领导者。它的任务是在群众中进行宣传与组织的工作，以实现党的号召与决定，动员企业的所有工作人员来完成生产计划，巩固劳动纪律，开展社会主义的竞赛运动，对工人与职员进行政治教育；经常地关怀着他们的文化福利的提高，监督企业遵守国家的利益。
    为了顺利地领导企业，行政机构与党组织的行动必须结合一致，党委会与经理之间必须保持着事务上的联系。经理对于企业的顺利领导，没有积极分子和党组织的支持是不可能的。比如说，经理要想推行某种办法，如果不去动员一切集体的力量，是否能够达到所期待的效果呢？当然不能。命令是要靠大家来执行的，因此，党组织的帮助就成为完全必要的了。
    不依靠党的积极分子和党的组织，不采纳集体的意见，不听取群众的呼声的经济领导者，乃是最坏的领导者。
    日丹诺夫同志在联共（布）第十八次代表大会上的报告中，谈到企图不依靠党的组织来领导企业的经理们时，曾认为这些人们一点也不懂得单一负责制。他说：“我们苏维埃的，布尔什维克的单一负责制，是善于管理，善于组织事务，选拔干部，作出正确的指示，要求总结，消除不负责任与逃避责任的现象。但同时，它也就意味着善于在这个工作中依靠党的组织，依靠企业中的积极分子，依靠企业中的群众全体。”
    联共（布）党章赋予生产部门的党组织以监督企业行政当局经营事业的权利。这种权利就是党组织随时可以了解决算报告，及其他表明企业生产与财政经济事业现况的文件，在党的大会上与会议上听取经济领导者的报告，向企业的行政当局提出关于生产上的缺点及松懈的问题，并建议消除这些现象的方法，向上级机关反映企业的事业现况等等。
    利用这些权利，党组织就可能在业务上影响企业的生产工作。在企业的领导者与党组织的正常相互关系之下，丝毫不会损伤经理的威信。相反地，监督权是要使党组织负责采用种种方法来巩固单一负责制，支持经理的权威。
    党组织没有权利强迫经理——一个经济领导者——去作那些为他所不同意的，并在他的单一负责者权限以内的事情。党组织没有权利取消经理的任何的处分命令。在必要时，它只有向上级党组织对经理的行为提出抗议之权。党委会不能发布任何有关生产工作的指示，或要求经济领导者同党组织商讨他的处分和命令。它也无权撤免，任用或调动工作人员，以及侵犯企业行政当局应有的职权。党组织不应将自己的领导混入业务的与经济的工作中去，它对企业的领导不同于经理，乃是要保证党的号召与指示的顺利实现。
    党的工作不可与生产任务脱节。斯大林同志教导我们说，经济和政治是不可分的，经济上的成就和它的巩固与持久性，完全有赖于党政工作的水平来决定。
    就本质而言，党的监督就是社会性的与群众性的监督。它的力量也正在于此。参与监督的人越多，这种监督便越有作用，越有效果。决不是一个党委会，尤其不是一个党委会的书记就可以明了企业中所发生的一切事体。如果党员都参加了党的监督，那情形就全不同了。最重要与最常用的党的监督方式，是在党员大会上，政治局与委员会会议上讨论企业管理者的报告。对于报告作详密的预先检查，根据布尔什维克的批评与自我批评广泛地讨论，作出具体的决议——所有这些不仅提高经济领导者对企业工作的责任感，同时也提高党组织和每一党员对于企业工作的责任感。
    另外还可采用这样一些方式，即由党委会主动地按期召集工作会议和生产会议：技术会议，斯达汉诺夫工作者，工程技术工作者的定期集会。同时，党组织必须开展与支持由下而上的批评，支持一切正当的建议，并尽力促使其实现。
    正确执行的党的监督，对企业领导上的缺点的尖锐批评，不但不会破坏单一负责制和经济领导者的威信，反而是巩固了它们。肯于依靠党组织和群众集体的企业经理，应该布尔什维克地接受批评，并且要深刻地检讨自己，而不必害怕党的监督与批评会降低他的威信。党组织的指示是在于改进企业的工作；而企业的增长，同时也就会助长经济领导者的威信。
