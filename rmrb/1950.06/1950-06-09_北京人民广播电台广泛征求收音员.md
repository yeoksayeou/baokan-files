　　Beijing People's Broadcasting Station Widely Seeks Radio Monitors
    [Our Newspaper] In accordance with the News Administration's "Decision on Establishing a Radio Listening Network," the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station has decided to widely establish radio monitors and radio monitor groups in the urban areas and near suburbs of the city. Any personnel from the city's government organs, military units, factories, enterprises, schools, and mass organizations who are willing to undertake radio listening organization work may apply to the station. Upon passing the station's review and being approved for registration, they will become the station's radio monitors. The main tasks undertaken by radio monitors are: organizing listeners to listen to the station's important programs; reporting on listening situations and listener opinions to the station on a regular basis; and introducing listener contributions and participation in broadcasting. The rights enjoyed by radio monitors are: purchasing, ordering, repairing radios or amplifiers and records from the People's Radio Equipment Factory affiliated with the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau according to preferential methods; subscribing to "People's Broadcasting" (this publication is not for sale) published by the Central People's Broadcasting Station and purchasing various series of books published by the Central People's Broadcasting Station according to preferential methods; purchasing "Beijing Broadcasting" and other publications published by the station according to preferential methods; and participating in forums, get-togethers, and other activities convened by the station.
