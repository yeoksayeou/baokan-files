　　Municipal Government Suburban Committee Issues Instructions:
    All Districts Should Actively Prevent Summer Disasters

    [Beijing News Agency] Since last autumn, the suburban areas of Beijing have made great achievements in production and self-rescue work. The spring famine is about to pass, and the wheat harvest is coming soon. However, due to the long-term devastation by the enemy and puppets in the past, the rural foundation is very weak, followed by the severe flood last year. Very little wheat was planted in some areas, and the wind and rain in April and May this spring caused slight losses, all of which indicate that production and disaster relief work must continue. In order to prevent possible summer disasters, the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government has issued instructions, calling on all districts to combine wheat protection and inspection of autumn sowing, and organize farmers to open canals and dig wells, and prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests according to specific possible conditions; go deep into villages and households, do careful calculations for the masses, and continue to engage in sideline businesses; save food after the wheat harvest, and exchange refined grains for coarse grains; encourage the masses to help each other with loans, organize production, solve the difficulties of households with no or little wheat, and pay attention to relief to the old, weak, orphans and widows.

　　市府郊委会发出指示
    各区应积极预防夏灾
    【京市新闻处讯】去秋以来，京郊生产自救工作已有很大成绩，春荒已快度过，麦收即将到来。但由于过去敌伪多年蹂躏，农村底子很薄弱，继以去年严重涝灾，个别地区种麦很少，今春四五月间的风雨又造成轻微损失，均说明生产救灾工作必须继续进行。为防止可能的夏灾，北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会顷发出指示，号召各区结合护麦及检查大秋播种工作，根据具体的可能条件，组织农民开渠打井，防治病虫害；深入村户，替群众精打细算，继续搞副业；麦收后节约食用，以细粮换粗粮；鼓励群众互助借贷，组织生产，解决无麦少麦户困难问题，并注意救济老弱孤寡。
