Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: The so-called plan for "joint operation" of coal and steel resources of France, Germany, and even the entire Western Europe, proposed by French Foreign Minister Schuman at the instigation of U.S. imperialism, has met with resistance from Britain. The United States is exerting increasing pressure on Britain.

As early as May 9th, when Schuman proposed this plan, British officials expressed "great reservations" (Agence France-Presse). At the London Three Foreign Ministers Conference, even with the personal support of U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, British Foreign Secretary Bevin resolutely refused to discuss it, arguing that Schuman's notification was too hasty and the three foreign ministers could not discuss the plan before it was submitted to experts for review. On May 25th, after Schuman completed negotiations with the West German puppet government in France and reached an agreement to implement the Schuman Plan, he sent a note to Britain requesting an international conference to be held in mid-June to negotiate the steps to implement the Schuman Plan, and requested that the countries concerned first issue a joint statement in principle endorsing the Schuman Plan before the negotiations. However, on the same day that Schuman issued his note, the British government also submitted a note to France after experts had studied the Schuman Plan, stating: "Britain is willing to fully participate in this negotiation, but cannot be bound" (British Information Services). After receiving the French note, Britain immediately submitted a reply note on May 27th, reiterating its views in the first note and rejecting Schuman's proposal.

Before submitting the note to Britain, Schuman had first submitted similar notes to the West German puppet government and the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Italy, and when submitting the above-mentioned note to Britain, some governments had already expressed their acceptance of the French note. Schuman attempted to create a fait accompli to force Britain to accept. However, as the London Times stated: "Even in the face of such pressure, the British government has decided that Britain cannot accept the proposed joint statement until certain issues have been clarified in international discussions" (Agence France-Presse).

Britain's refusal aroused the anger of the United States. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on May 26th: U.S. authorized persons expressed deep regret over this and stated that Britain "should act as a full sponsor of the plan" and that "France will very firmly uphold a plan that has received the full support of the United States."

Under the encouragement and instigation of the United States, Schuman again submitted a note to Britain on May 30th, the content of which, according to a British Foreign Office spokesperson, still insisted on his original proposal. Bevin immediately submitted a reply note again on June 1st. According to the British Information Services: It included a joint declaration format drafted by Britain, hoping that France would accept it. Although the content of the reply note was not disclosed, the British Foreign Office spokesperson still emphasized on May 31st that Britain could not "participate in any statement containing pre-assumed obligations."

Subsequently, after holding an emergency cabinet meeting late on June 2nd, the British government submitted a note to France, which advocated "holding a preparatory meeting of the ministers of the countries concerned in order to reach an agreement on the conditions for the British government to participate in the plenary meeting to discuss the Schuman Plan" (British Information Services). However, this note was flatly rejected by Schuman. The governments of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the West German puppet government issued a joint declaration on the 3rd, stating: "The six governments have decided to negotiate on the joint operation of coal and steel resources." "The six countries regard the establishment of a new high-level authority as the current goal, and its decisions will be binding on the six countries and any other country willing to participate." Based on this, Schuman replied to Britain, believing that Britain's suggestion was therefore "inapplicable" (Agence France-Presse), and that "the coal and steel pool negotiations will proceed as usual even without British participation" (Reuters).

In order to express its attitude towards France's rejection note, the British government also issued a communiqué on the same day, stating: "His Majesty's Government does not believe that it can accept in advance, nor does it wish to reject in advance, the principles on which the French proposal is based. ... It is impossible to participate in negotiations under the conditions proposed by the French government."

Faced with Britain's resolute resistance, the United States has decided to further increase its pressure. Senior U.S. State Department officials hinted on the same day that they would use cuts in Marshall Plan funding to pressure Britain. The U.S. State Department also issued a statement on June 5th, "welcoming" the establishment of the six-nation agreement. On June 7th, U.S. roving ambassador to Western Europe, Harriman, stated at a press conference in Washington, after claiming that he unreservedly supported the Schuman Plan: A portion of the $600 million in Marshall Plan funding originally earmarked for the so-called "European unification cause" may be allocated to support the Schuman Plan (Agence France-Presse). Schuman proposed to the cabinet on June 7th that the six-nation negotiations be held from June 20th. However, Britain has so far shown no indication of accepting the Schuman Plan.

### 舒曼提出“法德联营煤钢”计划  英与美法间矛盾尖锐化  美帝对英压力日益增加

　　舒曼提出“法德联营煤钢”计划
    英与美法间矛盾尖锐化  美帝对英压力日益增加
    【新华社十一日讯】美帝国主义授意法外交部长舒曼提出的所谓“联合经营”法、德两国以至整个西欧煤钢资源的计划，已受到英国的抵抗。美国正对英国施行日益增强的压力。
    早在五月九日舒曼提出这一计划之初，英国官方即表示“极大的保留”（法新社）。在伦敦三外长会议上，纵有美国国务卿艾奇逊的亲自支持，英国外相贝文仍然以舒曼通知过于匆促，三外长不能在该计划交付专家审查前对之进行讨论为辞，断然拒绝加以讨论。五月二十五日，舒曼在法国与西德傀儡政府完成谈判，达成同意实行舒曼计划的协议后，向英国发出照会，要求于六月中举行国际会议，谈判实行舒曼计划的步骤，并要求有关各国在谈判前首先发表一项联合声明，表示在原则上赞同舒曼计划。但是与舒曼发出其照会同日，英国政府也在专家研究舒曼计划完毕后，向法国提出照会，表示：“英国愿意充分参加这个谈判，但不能受约束”（英新处）。而在接获法国照会之后，英国又马上于五月二十七日提出复照，重申其在第一次照会中的意见，对舒曼建议予以拒绝。
    舒曼在向英国提出照会以前，曾先以类似的照会提交西德傀儡政府以及荷、比、卢、意各国政府，而在向英国提出上述照会时，即已有若干国政府纷纷表示接受法国照会。舒曼企图以此造成既成事实，逼迫英国接受。但是，如伦敦泰晤士报所称：“即使在这样的压力之前，英国政府还是决定在某些问题尚未在国际讨论中明朗化之前，英国不能接受这个拟议中的联合声明”（法新社）。
    英国的拒绝引起了美国的震怒，据法新社华盛顿五月二十六日电：美国受权人士对此表示深为遗憾，并称英国“应以该计划的完全赞助国的资格来行动”，而“法国将非常坚决地维护一个已得美国全心赞助的计划”。
    在美国鼓励与授意之下，舒曼又于五月三十日再度向英国提出照会，其内容据英国外交部发言人称，仍然是坚持其原来的建议。而贝文也随即于六月一日再度提出复照。据英新处称：其中包括一项英国拟订的联合宣言格式，希望法国接受。复照内容虽未披露，但英国外交部发言人在五月三十一日仍然强调，英国不能“参加任何包含预先担当的义务的声明”。
    接着，英国政府又于六月二日深晚在举行内阁紧急会议后，向法国提出一项照会，其中主张“由有关国家部长举行预备会议，以期获致有关英国政府参加讨论舒曼计划的全体会议之条件的协议”（英新处）。然而这一照会遭到了舒曼的干脆拒绝，法、意、荷、比、卢五国政府与西德傀儡政府竟于三日发表联合宣言，声称：“六国政府已决定就联合经营煤钢资源问题进行谈判。”“六国把成立新的高级权威机关作为当前目的，它的决定对六国以及任何其他愿参加的国家将有约束力。”舒曼并据此复照英国，认为英国建议已因此而“不合用”（法新社），“联营计划谈判，虽无英国参加，仍将照样进行”（路透社）。
    为了对法国的拒绝照会表明态度，英国政府也于同日发表公报称：“英王陛下政府认为不能预先接受，也不愿预先拒绝法国建议所根据的原则。……根据法国政府所提出的条件参加谈判，是不可能的。”
    对于英国这种断然的抵抗，美国已决定再度加强其压力。美国国务院高级官员于三日当天即暗示将以削减马歇尔计划拨款来压迫英国。美国国务院并于六月五日发表声明，“欢迎”六国成立协定。六月七日，美国驻西欧的所谓巡回大使哈里曼在华盛顿记者招待会上，在声称他毫无保留地赞成舒曼计划之后表示：马歇尔计划拨款中原定用于所谓“欧洲统一事业”的六亿美元中，可能有一部分指拨为支持舒曼计划之用（法新社）。舒曼已于六月七日向内阁提议六国谈判自六月二十日起举行。但是英国迄今仍无接受舒曼计划的表示。
