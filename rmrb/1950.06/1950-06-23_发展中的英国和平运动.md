　　Developing British Peace Movement
    Wei Yi
    The British National Peace Committee was only truly established about ten months ago. Originally, its members mainly consisted of people who had participated in the First World Peace Congress. Therefore, the mass base of this National Peace Committee itself was not very broad. In October of last year, a national conference was organized with a thousand representatives attending, representing over a million people. Since that conference, the work of the National Committee has been greatly strengthened, and the committee's mass base has also been greatly expanded. Up to now, the committee believes that it can be said that it has established a foothold and is carrying out its work normally.

    Currently, about fifty to sixty local peace committees have been established in various cities and regions. About ten of these are in London, and they are preparing to hold a conference to establish a pan-London peace committee. Cities where local peace committees have already been established include Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol, and Reading in England; and Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland. Almost every week, new committees and regional committees of the peace movement are established. In some towns and regions of the British Isles, sometimes even two or three peace committees appear each week.

    The first regional committee established was in West Wales, which is a typical example of the widespread support for local peace committees. Two local peace committees, previously established in the area, took on the initiative of convening a regional conference. In addition to the two local peace committees, the units attending the conference included seventeen branches of the National Union of Mineworkers, twelve local branches of the Communist Party, five churches of various sizes, three trades councils, and three branches of the Amalgamated Engineering Union.

    In addition to gaining the support of trade unions, the peace movement has also gained the support of cooperative organizations. In many places, cooperative societies have initiated the convening of regional peace conferences to establish regional peace committees. This was the case in the Streatham area of London. The local Women's Co-operative Guild was responsible for convening the local peace conference, establishing the committee, and setting up daily work.

    Since the National Peace Committee launched a nationwide peace signature campaign on April 24, the influence of the peace committees has further expanded, and the movement for defending world peace in Britain has rapidly developed. For the British people, nothing is more closely related to their well-being than the issue of peace. However, they have not been able to find effective ways to express their desire for peace in the past. Now, they regard this peace signature as an effective way to express this desire.

    Soon after the National Peace Committee sent out 120,000 declaration forms across the country, the first batch of completed declarations began to arrive one after another. Within a week, the central office of the National Peace Committee had received a large number of completed forms, with 5,000 signatures attached, and the demand for forms was steadily increasing. A 76-year-old man who had lost an arm wrote to request a thousand signature forms, intending to personally collect these signatures. His letter was just one of the countless letters received by the committee requesting forms.

    The committee also printed a leaflet called "Never Again." The first printing was 250,000 copies, each sold at a penny. Only a day or two after these leaflets were printed, the committee had already distributed 60,000 copies.

    The peace signature campaign has also brought together peace-loving people within other groups who have not yet been connected with the overall peace movement around the peace committees. For example, in the past two weeks, the National Council of Churches, which owns most of the Puritan Free Churches, the Buddhist Federation, and the British Red Cross, have all stated that they oppose atomic warfare and another world war under any circumstances.

    The unfolding of the peace signature movement has alarmed the ruling class in Britain. On the one hand, they have hurriedly taken repressive measures to deal with the peace movement. On the other hand, they have had to instigate their pro-government local newspapers to begin to change their attitude of resisting the peace movement, in order to deceive the British people.

    When the West Wales peace conference was held, a most important local newspaper, the *Talbot Port Express*, added a half-page headline to its main news section: "Welsh Peace Movement Begins," and reported on the conference in detail. In Acton, a town within Greater London, when the local peace conference was held, the local newspaper published the large headline: "Acton Supports Peace."

    Currently, the British peace movement is continuing to grow and develop. The peace declaration signature campaign will continue throughout the summer. The number of local peace committees will soon be counted in the hundreds, rather than the tens. The National Peace Committee intends to convene a larger-scale national conference this year to promote the peace movement to every corner of the country.

　　发展中的英国和平运动
    伟一
    英国全国和平委员会是约在十个月前才真正成立的。原来它的组成分子主要是曾经参加了第一次世界拥护和平大会的人们。因此，这个全国和平委员会本身的群众基础，还是不十分广泛的。到去年十月，组织了一个全国性的会议，有一千名代表出席，代表着百万余人民。自从那次会议以后，全国委员会的工作大为加强，委员会的群众基础也大为扩大了。到现在为止，委员会认为已经可以说：它已立定了脚跟，并在正常地进行工作了。
    目前，约五十至六十个地方和平委员会已在各城市和各地区成立。其中约有十来个是在伦敦的，它们正在筹备举行一次会议，以成立全伦敦的和平委员会。已经成立了地方和平委员会的城市，在英格兰，有曼彻斯特、利物浦、北明翰、布利斯托尔和里丁等地；在苏格兰，则有格拉斯哥和爱丁堡两市。几乎每周都有和平运动的新的委员会和区域委员会成立，在英伦三岛的若干市镇和区域，有时甚至每周有两三个和平委员会出现。
    第一个成立的区域委员会，是西威尔斯地方的，这是各地和平委员会受到广泛支持的典型。两个先在该区成立的地方和平委员会，肩负起召开区域会议的倡议工作。出席会议的单位除了两个地方和平委员会外，尚有全国矿工联盟的十七个分会，十二个共产党地方支部，五个大小教堂，三个工会理事会和混合机器工会的三个分会。
    和平运动除了获得工会的支持之外，也获得了合作社组织的支持。在好些地方，是由合作社倡议召集区域和平会议以成立区域和平委员会的。伦敦的斯特利翰区域的情形就是这样。该地的妇女合作公会负责召集地方和平会议，成立了委员会，并建立了日常的工作。
    全国和平委员会自四月二十四日发起了全国性的和平签名运动以后，和平委员会的影响进一步地扩大，英国保卫世界和平的运动，迅速地发展了。对英国人民说来，没有任何东西比和平问题更为休戚相关的了。但是他们过去一直找不到有效的办法，来表达他们对和平的热望。现在这个和平签名，他们把它看成了表达此种愿望的有效办法。
    当全国和平委员会的十二万份宣言表格刚向全国各地发出不久，第一批填好的宣言即开始陆续送来。在一星期内，全国和平委员会中央办公处就收回了大批填好了的表格，附有五千人的签名，而对表格的要求则正有增无已。一位失去了一只手臂的七十六岁的老翁写信索取一千个签名用的表格，他打算亲自从事征集这些签名的工作。他的信件正是委员会收到的无数索取表格的信件之一。
    委员会也印发了一种名为“永远不再发生”的传单。第一次印出二十五万份，每份以一便士的价格出售。这些传单印出才一两天，委员会就已经发出了六万份。
    对于那些与总的和平运动尚未有联系的其他团体内的爱好和平人士，和平签名运动也把他们团聚到和平委员会的周围来了。例如，在过去两星期内，拥有大多数清教派自由教会的全国教会理事会，佛教徒联合会和英国红十字会等，都认为要在任何情况下宣布反对原子战争，反对另一次世界大战。
    和平签名运动的展开，使英国的统治阶级吓慌了手脚，它们一方面慌忙采取镇压措施，来对付和平运动，另一方面，它们不得不嗾使御用的地方报纸，开始改变它们抵制和平运动的态度，借此欺骗英国人民。
    当西威尔斯和平会议在举行的时候，一个最重要的地方报纸《塔尔波特港快报》在其重要新闻版上加上一条半版的标题：“威尔斯和平运动发韧”，并详细地报导了会议的情形。在大伦敦范围内的一个市镇阿克顿，当该地和平会议召开的时候，当地的报纸刊出了这样的大标题：“阿克顿拥护和平”。
    目前，英国和平运动正在继续壮大和发展中。和平宣言的签名运动将在整个夏季中继续进行。地方和平委员会的数目不久当可以百计，而不再是以十计了。全国和平委员会打算在本年内召集一次更大规模的全国会议，把和平运动推广到全国每一个角落去。
