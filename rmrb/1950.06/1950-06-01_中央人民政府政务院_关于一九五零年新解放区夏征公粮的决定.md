Xinhua News Agency, 31st—The full text of the Decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the Summer Grain Collection in Newly Liberated Areas in 1950 (approved at the 34th Government Administration Council meeting on May 30, 1950) is as follows:

　　1. As the summer harvest is approaching, to make it easier for the people to pay public grain, it is decided that in areas with summer harvests and without severe disasters, the public grain to be borne by the people shall be paid in two seasons, summer and autumn. The public grain paid in summer shall be part of the total public grain to be paid for the whole year.

　　2. The total amount of national public grain collected in summer shall not exceed 13% of the total income of summer harvest regular produce on average, taking the large administrative region as a unit; the local surtax shall not exceed 15% of the national public grain collection amount, taking the province as a unit.

　　3. Newly liberated areas refer to areas where land reform has not been implemented. The summer grain collection shall be collected according to progressive methods. The collection methods shall be formulated by the military and political committees of the major administrative regions according to the following principles:

　　A. Households exempt from or with reduced taxes: Poor families of martyrs, military personnel, and supply system workers, as well as orphans, widows, the elderly and weak, and those who are still unable to bear the burden after the summer harvest disaster areas, shall be exempt from or have their public grain reduced in the summer; however, except for disaster areas, in areas with more poor households, the number of households exempt from taxes shall not exceed 20% of the total number of households with summer harvests in the area, taking the district as a unit.

　　B. Progressive rates: Under the proportion that the total amount of summer grain collection does not exceed 13% of the total income of summer harvest regular produce, the progressive rates for the collection of each class are stipulated as follows: The collection amount shall be based on household units, and the maximum for poor peasants shall not exceed 10% of their summer harvest; the maximum for middle peasants shall not exceed 15% of their summer harvest; the maximum for rich peasants shall not exceed 25% of their summer harvest; the maximum for landlords shall not exceed 50% of their summer harvest. For special households with an annual income of more than 2,000 dan, the provincial people's government may separately stipulate the collection amount, but the maximum shall not exceed 80% of their summer harvest. Summer grain collection in various places should be based on this progressive rate and must not be violated.

　　C. For land where landlords have legally implemented rent reduction, the summer public grain shall be reasonably shared by both landlords and tenants; for land where landlords have not legally implemented rent reduction, the summer public grain shall be entirely borne by the landlords, and the tenants shall not bear it.

　　D. After the landlord reduces rent, tenants who can afford to pay rent should pay rent. If, due to natural disasters and poor harvests, tenants are unable to pay rent, the summer public grain of the land where the landlord failed to collect rent can be exempted.

　　4. Agricultural income shall be calculated based on the normal annual yield of the land. The normal annual yield refers to the harvest amount of land with certain natural conditions (such as soil quality, terrain, water conservancy, climate, etc.) under general management conditions and customary planting habits. When estimating the normal annual yield in various places, it must be realistic and must not be overestimated or underestimated. For the same land, those who increase production due to diligent cultivation, good management, or planting "cash crops" shall not have their burden increased for the increased production; those who reduce production due to lazy cultivation shall not have their burden reduced for the reduced production.

　　5. The grain borrowed from the people last year due to war needs that has not yet been repaid, and the portion exceeding the amount of public grain to be collected in the autumn grain collection last year, shall be repaid in installments within three years according to the "Instructions on Land Reform and Collection of Public Grain in Newly Liberated Areas" issued by the Government Administration Council on February 24 this year; part of it may be repaid in this year's summer collection, and the amount shall be proposed by the military and political committees of the major administrative regions and reported to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government for approval. The public grain owed in the autumn grain collection last year shall also be sorted out separately in accordance with the above instructions.

　　6. This year's summer collection will mainly collect wheat and early rice, and a part of cash may also be collected. The amount of cash collection must be proposed by the financial and economic committees of the major administrative regions and reported to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for approval.

　　7. Local people's governments at all levels, especially at the county, district, and township (village) levels, should mobilize all staff and people's organizations to go to the countryside in person based on the principles and methods of this decision, and conduct extensive explanations to the public grain burden households, so that everyone can understand the people's government's summer grain collection policy and tax rate ratio, so as to assist and supervise the grain collection personnel to complete the summer grain collection task correctly and properly in accordance with the actual rural situation and the summer grain collection tax rate. Personnel handling grain collection must act in accordance with this decision, and strictly prohibit commandist work styles. If the public grain burden households or the township (village) government believes that there are cases of excessively light or heavy burdens or exceeding the progressive collection rate, they may file a complaint with the township (village), district, and county people's governments. The township (village), district, and county people's governments shall promptly investigate and make a ruling in accordance with the law, and shall not delay or be perfunctory. However, during the appeal period, taxpayers must pay according to the original amount on schedule, and it will be cleared after the ruling.

　　8. The military and political committees of the major administrative regions and the provincial (municipal) people's governments may formulate implementation measures based on this decision and the specific circumstances of the locality and report them to the Government Administration Council for record. In the implementation, the collection must be carried out in strict accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of this decision; people's governments at all levels must not adopt the method of increasing the number of people and amounts at each level.

　　中央人民政府政务院
    关于一九五零年新解放区夏征公粮的决定
    【新华社三十一日讯】中央人民政府政务院关于一九五零年新解放区夏征公粮的决定（一九五零年五月三十日政务院第三十四次政务会议通过），全文如下：
    一、夏收即届，为使人民易于交纳公粮，决定凡有夏收而非严重灾荒的地区，人民应负担的公粮分夏秋两季交纳。夏季交纳的公粮，为全年应交公粮的一部分。
    二、夏征国家公粮，以大行政区为单位，征收总额平均不得超过夏收正产物总收入的百分之十三；地方附加以省为单位，不得超过国家公粮征收额的百分之十五。
    三、新解放区系指未实行土地改革的地区而言，其夏征公粮按累进办法征收，征收办法由各大行政区军政委员会依下列原则规定之：
    甲、免征或减征户：凡烈士家属、军人家属、供给制工作人员家属之贫苦者，孤寡老弱，及夏收后灾区之仍无力负担者，夏季均得免征或减征公粮；但除灾区外，贫苦户较多地区，以区为单位，免征户不得多于该区有夏收的总户数的百分之二十。
    乙、累进率：在夏征总额不超过夏收正产物总收入的百分之十三的比例下，对各阶层的征收累进率规定如下：征收额均以户为单位，贫农最高不得超过其夏收的百分之十；中农最高不得超过其夏收的百分之十五；富农最高不得超过其夏收的百分之二十五；地主最高不得超过其夏收的百分之五十。特殊户全年收入在两千石以上者，得由各省人民政府另行规定征收额，但最高亦不得超过其夏收的百分之八十。各地夏征应根据此累进率，不得违背。
    丙、地主已依法实行减租的土地，夏季公粮应由地主与佃农双方合理分担；地主未依法实行减租的土地，夏季公粮应完全由地主负担，佃农不负担。
    丁、地主减租后，佃农交得起租者即应交租。如确因天灾歉收，佃农无力交租者，可免除该地主未能收租部分之土地的夏季公粮。
    四、农业收入，按土地的常年应产量计算。常年应产量是指一定自然条件（如土质、地势、水利、气候等）的土地，在一般经营条件和通常种植习惯下的收获量。各地估计常年应产量时，要切合实际，不得估计过高，亦不得估计过低。同等的土地，因勤劳耕作善于经营或种植“经济作物”而增产者，其增产部分，不增加负担；因怠于耕作而减产者，其减产部分，亦不减少负担。
    五、去年因战争需要所借人民的粮食尚未还清者，及去年秋征公粮中超过应征公粮数额的部分，应根据政务院今年二月二十四日“关于新解放区土地改革及征收公粮的指示”在三年内分期偿还之；本年夏征中，得偿还一部，其数额由大行政区军政委员会拟议报中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准。在去年秋征中尾欠的公粮，亦应依上述指示分别清理之。
    六、今年夏征以征收小麦、早稻为主，并得征一部现款，征收现款数额，须由各大行政区财政经济委员会拟议报中央人民政府财政部批准。
    七、各级地方人民政府，尤其是县、区、乡（村）三级应动员全体工作人员及各人民团体，根据此决定原则和办法，亲自下乡，向公粮负担户进行广泛解释，务使大家了解人民政府的夏征政策及税率比例，以协助和监督征粮人员能按照农村实际状况及夏征税率，正确而妥当地完成夏征任务。办理征粮人员，必须按照本决定办事，严禁命令主义的作风。公粮负担户或乡（村）政府如认为有畸轻畸重及超过征收累进率情事，得向乡（村）、区、县人民政府提出申诉，乡（村）、区、县人民政府应及时调查，依法裁定，不得拖延不理或敷衍塞责。但在申诉期间纳税人须按原定数额如期缴纳，俟裁定后清理之。
    八、各大行政区军政委员会和省（市）人民政府得根据本决定及当地具体情况制定实施办法报告政务院备案。在执行中必须严格遵照本决定第三条之规定办法进行征收；各级人民政府不得采用层层增加人数数额的办法。
