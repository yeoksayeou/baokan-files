　　Schumann Plan Negotiations Suddenly Interrupted
    Western European Countries Disagree with France's Proposals
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 26th] The negotiations concerning the Schumann Plan among France, Italy, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, which began in Paris on June 20th, were suddenly suspended on the 24th after five days of discussions. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris: after the French side presented its draft plan, the remaining five delegations have returned to their respective countries to consult with their governments, and are expected to reconvene on the 26th for further discussions. The progress of the meeting revealed that the French (in reality, the American) plan has met with serious resistance from other countries. Reuters, citing sources participating in the meeting, reported that the first week of discussions was almost a one-man show by France, while the representatives of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, and West Germany bombarded the meeting's chairman, the French representative Monnet, with a barrage of questions. The French idea is to first establish a supreme regulatory body, leaving the technical arrangements for managing the coal and steel alliance to be formulated by this new body after it has obtained the specific provisions of the treaty and its existence has been ratified. The questions raised by the representatives of various countries reflected their disagreement with the French proposals.

　　舒曼计划谈判突告中断
    西欧各国不同意法国的意见
    【新华社二十六日讯】六月二十日在巴黎开始的法、意、西德、荷、比、卢六国关于舒曼计划的谈判，在进行五天后，已于二十四日突然中止。据路透社巴黎讯：在法国方面提出其计划草案以后，其余五国代表团已返国向各该政府请示，俟二十六日重行集会讨论。会议进程透露，法国的（实际上是美国的）计划已受到其他各国的严重反抗。路透社引参加会议人士透露的消息称：第一周的讨论几乎等于法国在表演独脚戏，而比、荷、卢、意和西德的代表则向会议主持者、法国代表摩纳发出一连串的问题。法国的意见是首先成立最高管制机构，而把管理煤钢联营的技术布置，留待这一新机构在获得条约的具体规定并批准其存在之后再来拟定。各国代表提出的问题，反映了他们不同意法国的意见。
