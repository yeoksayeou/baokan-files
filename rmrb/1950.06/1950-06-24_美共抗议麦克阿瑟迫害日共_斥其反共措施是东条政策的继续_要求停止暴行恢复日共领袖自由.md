　　Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: The Communist Party of the United States sent a telegram to MacArthur on the 13th, protesting MacArthur's atrocities in persecuting the Japanese Communist Party. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 19th, the protest telegram was signed by Hall, Secretary of the National Committee of the CPUSA. The telegram denounced MacArthur's anti-communist measures as a continuation of Hirohito and Tojo's policies. These measures "violate the Japanese Constitution, scorn the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, and insult the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution." The CPUSA also accused MacArthur's policy of being "a blatant attempt to turn Japan into a huge military base and make it economically and politically a colony of Wall Street." The telegram condemned MacArthur, stating: You should be working to eliminate Japanese militarism, imprisoning all those responsible for the Pearl Harbor incident, and not imprisoning the vanguard of Japanese democratic forces. The telegram demanded: The freedom of all Communist leaders must be restored, all persecution of them and the Communist Party's newspapers must cease, and on the other hand, war criminals who conducted germ warfare against the Chinese people should be brought to trial. The CPUSA concluded its telegram by saying: "The American people have had enough of reactionary Japan. Let the Japanese people independently build a democratic, progressive country!" We should let the Japanese people cooperate with the rising new Asia and engage in democratic and peaceful development.
    The CPUSA sent a copy of the telegram with an accompanying letter to the Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, Akahata, which read: "To the Japanese working class and all fighters for democracy, the Communist Party of the United States is willing to use its utmost strength to mobilize public opinion to support your party and your party's leaders, and to support the democratic development within Japan."

　　美共抗议麦克阿瑟迫害日共
    斥其反共措施是东条政策的继续  要求停止暴行恢复日共领袖自由
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国共产党于十三日致电麦克阿瑟，抗议麦克阿瑟迫害日本共产党的暴行。据美联社东京十九日讯：该抗议电由美共全国委员会书记霍尔签字。该电斥责麦克阿瑟的反共措施是裕仁与东条政策的继续。这种措施“违犯日本宪法，蔑视联合国的人权宣言，而且侮蔑了美国宪法的权利法案”。美共并指责麦克阿瑟的政策是“很明显地企图把日本变成一个庞大的军事基地，并使其在经济上与政治上成为华尔街的殖民地”。该电谴责麦克阿瑟称：你应当进行消除日本军国主义的工作，囚禁所有对珍珠港事件负有责任的人们，而不应当囚禁日本民主力量的先锋队。该电要求：所有共产党领袖的自由必须予以恢复，一切对他们及共产党的报纸的迫害必须停止，另一方面，则应将那些进行危害中国人民的细菌战的战犯送交法庭审判。美共在其电报的结语中称：“美国人民已经受够反动的日本之害了。让日本人民自主地去建立一个民主的、进步的国家吧！”我们应当让日本人民与正在兴起的新亚洲合作，从事民主的、和平的发展。
    美共把这个电报的内容抄了一份，并附了一封信寄给日共机关报赤旗报，信上写道：“日本工人阶级和争取民主的全体斗士们，美国共产党愿意用它的最大的力量动员舆论来支援你们的党和你们党的领袖，支援日本国内的民主发展”。
