　　Millions of laborers crossed mountains to actively transport grain
　　Hunan Province completes surplus grain transfer
　　Expenditure on transportation supports more than two million farmers in overcoming natural disasters.
　　[Changsha News] Xin Hunan Bao news: Hunan Province's surplus grain transfer work has been completed as scheduled. Among them, the 350 million jin of rice transported to East China, Guangdong, Hankou, and within the province for adjustment had already exceeded the target by mid-May; more than half of the 30 million jin transferred to Guangxi has also been transported. At the end of May, the province stopped receiving grain, and the province's grain transportation work came to an end.
　　As early as January this year, the Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau, in accordance with instructions from higher authorities, deployed a large-scale grain transportation work plan. Among the ten special districts and seventy-seven counties in the province, seven special districts and thirty-eight counties were responsible for the task of transferring public grain. During the transportation, eighty handover points were set up, more than one thousand cadres were assigned, and various means of transportation were mobilized, including 3,979 railway cars and more than 19,000 civilian boats. According to statistics from only five special districts, Changsha, Yiyang, Changde, Shaoyang, and Lingling, the number of mobilized laborers reached 1,436,975.
　　At the beginning of the grain transportation, due to rumors and instigation by special agents and illegal landlords, and the lack of correct understanding of the use of public grain by some of the masses, some incidents of obstructing transportation and looting grain occurred. In addition, some cadres had departmentalism and were unwilling to transport grain out. In particular, the lack of a unified grain transportation organization at all levels and poor coordination led to slow progress. Only 11.5 percent of the task was completed in January and February. In early March, the Provincial Grain Bureau, Hunan Shipping Company, and the Changsha branch of the East China Grain Bureau and the Central China Grain Company, which came to take over the public grain, jointly organized the Provincial Grain Transportation Headquarters, and the work gradually improved. However, unified organizations at the provincial level and below had not yet been established, and ideological unity had not been fully achieved. In early April, the Provincial Grain Transportation Headquarters was reorganized into the Grain Transportation Command, and the special districts and counties established command headquarters, and the districts established grain transportation stations. After the organizational structure was improved, leaders at all levels further recognized the important role of the central government's unified allocation and use of public grain in stabilizing prices and overcoming the country's financial difficulties, and initially overcame the one-sided "mass viewpoint" and departmentalism of some cadres. At the same time, in the rent reduction movement in the vast rural areas in March and April, the prestige of illegal landlords was initially suppressed, and the awareness of the peasant masses was generally improved, thereby reversing the masses' misunderstanding of the grain transportation work. The districts, townships, and baos automatically established labor teams and boat transportation teams, transporting grain across mountains and rivers regardless of sunny or rainy days. Due to the enthusiasm of the masses, by the end of April, twenty-three of the thirty-eight counties carrying out grain transportation work had completed their tasks ahead of schedule.
　　During the grain transportation, various places successively spent more than 71.18 million jin of rice in transportation fees, which at least solved the livelihood of more than 2.37 million people for one month, and strongly supported the local farmers in overcoming natural disasters and carrying out spring plowing and production.

　　百万民工翻山越岭积极运送
    湖南全省完成余粮调运
    开支运费支持了二百多万农民战胜灾荒
    【长沙讯】新湖南报消息：湖南省调运余粮工作，已如期完成任务。其中运往华东、广东、汉口以及省内的调剂粮三亿五千万斤大米，早在五月中旬即超额完成；调运广西的三千万斤也已运完一半以上。五月底该省停止接收，全省运粮工作遂告结束。
    早在今年一月间，湖南省粮食局即依照上级指示，布置了一个庞大的运粮工作计划。全省十个专区七十七县中，有七个专区三十八个县担负了调运公粮任务。在调运中，设立了八十个交接点，配备了一千以上的干部，动员了各种交通工具，其中火车皮达三千九百七十九节，民船达一万九千余只，发动民工仅据长沙、益阳、常德、邵阳、零陵五个专区的统计即达一百四十三万六千九百七十五名。
    开始运粮时，由于特务分子、不法地主造谣、挑拨，及部分群众对公粮的运用缺乏正确认识，因而发生过一些阻运和抢粮事件。加上某些干部存在着本位主义思想，不愿粮食外运，特别是因为没有建立各级统一领导的运粮组织，配合不好，步调不一，以致工作进展迟缓。一、二两月份仅完成任务百分之一十一点五。三月初，省粮食局、湖南航运公司与外来接运公粮的华东粮食局、华中粮食公司长沙分公司四单位联合组织了全省运粮指挥部，工作逐渐好转。但省以下各级统一机构尚未建立，思想上仍不能做到完全统一。四月初即将省运粮指挥部改组为运粮司令部，专区及县成立指挥部，区成立运粮站。组织机构健全后，各级领导上也进一步认识到中央统一调度使用公粮对稳定物价、克服国家财经困难的重要作用，初步克服了某些干部的片面“群众观点”和本位主义思想。同时，三、四月间在广大农村的减租运动中初步打击了不法地主的威风，农民群众觉悟程度普遍提高，从而扭转了群众对运粮工作的错误认识，各区、乡、保纷纷自动成立了民工队及船运队，不分晴雨，爬山越岭地运送。由于群众的热情，到四月底进行运粮工作的三十八个县就有二十三个县提前超额完成了任务。
    在运粮中，各地陆续开支运费七千一百一十八万余斤大米，至少解决了二百三十七万以上人口一个月的生活，有力地支持了各地农民战胜灾荒并进行春耕生产。
