　　The Sixth Branch of Factory No. 70
    Workers Enthusiastically Donate Equipment
    [This Newspaper reported] The workers of the Sixth Branch of Factory No. 70, due to their increased political awareness and concern for improving factory production, recently spontaneously launched a "Donation Movement." As of the end of May, more than ten workers have donated a large amount of equipment. In December last year, lathe operator Du Yongshou saw that the factory lacked grinding wheels, so he donated a ten-inch grinding wheel. In January of this year, lathe operator Chu Zirong donated eight 2/3 white steel cutter heads. Lathe operator Wang Yunliang donated a 1/3 white steel cutter head. Workers Wang Junyan, Bao Jigeng, and others also successively donated equipment. The trade union commended these workers. However, because the effort was not vigorously pursued, the movement did not develop further.
    In early May, the factory promoted the democratization of factory management. Leading cadres reviewed their past work, and the workers put forward more than 500 suggestions. The workers further realized that they were the masters of the factory.
    In May, the production task of the Sixth Branch was 1,300 sets of taps and 50 sets of 6 3/8-inch chucks. Because the tap material was too hard, ordinary white steel cutter heads could not withstand it. The factory bought some cutter heads, but they were still not good. In order to complete the production task, the workers actively tried to find solutions. Du Yongshou, the leader of Lathe Group One, brought two 1/3 white steel heads from home, and lathe operator Chu Zirong donated six catties of wind steel and a three-inch pressure ball bearing. Then, lathe operator Wei Zhiyi donated two 2/3 white steel cutter heads. Zang Zhen donated a 1/2 white steel cutter head. Zhang Kun, the deputy leader of Group Four, donated a scribing plate and a six-inch oilstone. Feng Xiaogong donated nine catties of oil steel. The trade union and the administrative side used the blackboard newspaper to commend them and called on workers to actively donate. In recent days, the workers have donated many tools and materials. Lathe operator Liu Fanggui donated a seventeen-twist drill bit. Bao Jigeng donated a small lathe oil pump. Gao Baoyi donated a number two adjustable wrench. Yu Chongqi, the leader of the fitter group, donated a two-twist drill bit. Previously, Zang Zhen brought a micrometer with a range of up to 25 from home for work convenience and also stated that he would donate it to the factory. By the end of May, the things donated by everyone were worth about 1,500 catties of millet.

　　七十兵工厂第六所
    工友踊跃献器材
    【本报讯】七十兵工厂第六所工人，由于政治认识较前提高关心提高工厂生产，最近自动发起“献东西运动”。至五月底止，已有十余位工友献出大批器材。去年十二月间，车工杜永寿见到厂里缺少砂轮，就献出了一个十寸的砂轮。今年一月，车工褚子荣献出八块二分三号的白钢刀头。车工王蕴良献出了一块三分的白钢刀头。工友王俊岩、包继耕等也陆续献出器材。工会表扬了这些工友。但因为抓的不紧，没有使运动发展起来。
    五月初，该厂推行工厂管理民主化运动。领导干部对于过去的工作作了检讨，工友们提出了五百多条意见。工人们进一步认识到自己是工厂的主人。
    五月份，六所的生产任务是一千三百套丝锥，五十套六寸三分卡盘，因丝锥材料太硬一般的白钢刀头都顶不住。厂方买了一些刀头，仍不好用。工友们为了完成生产任务，都积极想办法。车工一组组长杜永寿，从家里拿来两块三分白钢头，车工褚子荣献出六斤风钢，一个三寸压力滚珠。接着，车工魏之一献出了两块二分三号白钢刀头。臧振献出一块二分白钢刀头。四组副组长张锟献出一个划线盘一块六寸油石。冯孝功献出九斤油钢。工会与行政方面利用黑板报进行表扬，并号召工友们踊跃捐献。连日以来，工友们纷纷的捐献了很多工具、材料。车工刘芳桂献出了一个十七糖麻花钻头。包继耕献出一个车床小油泵。高宝义献出一把二号活搬子。钳工组长尤崇麒献出一个二糖麻花钻头。以前臧振为了工作便利，由家拿来一个只至二十五的千分尺也声明献给厂子。这个运动到五月底计大家所献的东西约合小米一千五百斤。
