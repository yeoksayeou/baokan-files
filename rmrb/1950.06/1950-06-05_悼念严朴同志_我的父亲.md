　　In Memory of Comrade Yan Pu – My Father
    Yan Weibing

    Comrade Yan Pu (Yan Daren), a native of Wuxi, Jiangsu, joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1925. During the Great Revolution, he actively led the workers' movement in Wuxi. After the "April 12th" incident, he led the peasants of Wuxi in armed resistance against rent and taxes. In 1928, he attended the Sixth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. In 1929, under the White Terror, he engaged in revolutionary activities in Shanghai. That autumn, he was arrested in the French Concession and endured brutal torture, remaining heroically unyielding throughout. In 1931, Comrade Yan Pu was transferred to the Shanghai Party leadership to work in a covert organization. He later transferred to the Jiangxi Revolutionary Base Area, serving as Deputy Minister of the National Economic Department of the Central Government. During the Long March, he was sent to Chongqing and Yichang to organize transportation stations due to illness. Later, he was sent to the Soviet Union to study. After returning to China in 1938, he served as Chief of the Second Section of the Central Organization Department, Secretary-General and Chief of the Second Section of the Eighth Route Army Office in Xi'an and Chongqing, and other positions. After the Japanese surrender, he was sent to work in the Northeast. Last spring, he was ordered to go south, and he was recuperating in Beijing due to illness. He unfortunately passed away on June 5, 1949.

    It has been a year since my father was laid to rest in the cemetery in the western suburbs of the capital. With a heavy heart, I reminisce about his life and his excellent and exemplary qualities. However, due to long periods of separation, I only spent time with my father during the last two months of his life, when he was bedridden and undergoing treatment in the hospital. Therefore, although I am his comrade and daughter, I do not know much about him.

    My father was born into a wealthy landlord family and was a college student. Before he embraced Marxism, he lived a parasitic life without labor, and the villagers called him "Third Young Master." The Great Revolution of 1925 brought about a tremendous change in my father's thinking. He actively participated in the anti-imperialist May Thirtieth Movement and was among the first fifteen arrested. Later, he resolutely betrayed his class origin and joined the Chinese Communist Party. The Party educated and transformed my father. After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in the "April 12th" coup, under the cruel White Terror, my father led peasants in armed struggles against rent and taxes. He was the first to give his land to the peasants and refused to collect rent. He also led the peasants in fighting against the Kuomintang's armed "rural cleansing" under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions. At that time, he had transformed from a friend of the peasants to a beloved leader of the vast peasantry in several counties in southern Jiangsu. Until the War of Resistance Against Japan, the peasants of Wuxi still hoped for my father to return home. At that time, the Party organization in the Wuxi area of southern Jiangsu raised the banner of "Yan Pu" to organize armed resistance against Japan.

    For twenty-five years, the firm belief in "liberating the suffering masses!" inspired his unremitting fighting spirit. He experienced the trials of a long and arduous life. Under the severe White Terror, in the extremely dangerous secret work in big cities, and under the torture of various cruelties in imperialist prisons, he always advanced bravely and never showed the slightest sign of discouragement or wavering!

    My father was good at approaching and uniting with the masses. Because of his selflessness and willingness to help others, he was able to deeply understand the suffering of the masses and fought selflessly for the revolutionary cause! In the early days of his participation in the revolution, he spent money like water. When the villagers encountered irresistible difficulties such as disasters and diseases, he did his best to help them without being stingy. Therefore, when my father returned to his hometown during summer and New Year holidays, my home became lively. Poor villagers from nearby came one after another to ask my father to solve various large and small problems. Many people came crying, and left smiling. Subsequently, from this sympathy for the peasants, he further organized and led the peasants to struggle against the landlords. In 1927 and 1928, when the Great Revolution failed and the counter-revolutionaries carried out "suppression," the peasants of the surrounding villages used their strength and wisdom to protect our families in distress on the one hand, and to cover my father's work on the other. Old farmers joined several villages to set up guards to deal with the military police and the landlords' armed forces. In the worst situations, my father was often moved several times a night under the cover of the peasants. Once, my father had no choice but to hide in the cemetery, and old women avoided the attention of the landlord's defense corps, secretly bringing him food at night. A kind old woman put boiled eggs and offerings for the gods in her chest and around her waist, delivered them to my father, and asked curiously: "Mr. Yan, your family is rich, you wear silk and eat meat, why are you a communist, suffering this hardship, and if you are caught, you will lose your life?" My father told her: In order to enable all poor people in the world to wear silk and eat meat, he became a communist. And he preached to her the reason for the liberation of the working people. The old woman cried with emotion and sadness. Last May, when my father was critically ill, reviewing this old memory, he asked the doctor to allow him to eat boiled eggs with shells, and strongly hoped that his illness would improve, return to Jiangnan, see the place of refuge, and the kind old woman. In 1929, when my father was conducting trade union activities among rickshaw pullers in the French South District of Shanghai, he lived with the rickshaw pullers day and night. He ate with them during the day and slept with them on the sidewalks by the roadside at night. And he never felt that life was difficult.

    My father was kind and patient with his comrades and subordinates. When he saw the strengths of others, even the slightest progress, he would encourage them with great joy. When he saw the shortcomings of his comrades, or they did not change after repeated persuasion, he would be so sad that he shed tears. During his critical illness, many intern doctors accompanied the chief doctor on rounds every morning. Some young doctors were a little far away from his bed, or did not concentrate on listening, and my father was very anxious. He laboriously waved his hand and called out: "Come! Come closer, you can't hear if you stand far away." "Learn well from me, a critically ill patient, and feel my bulging spleen, and study why?"

    Whenever the Party gave my father any difficult work, or assigned him to any remote and bitter place, he always accepted it gladly and worked hard. He never bargained, never made selfish considerations, and never cared about "fame," "position," or "living conditions." What he considered was only how to complete the task given by the Party and how not to disappoint the Party's expectations of him. He told me that he was often very happy, "I don't have trivial and unnecessary worries, because I don't care about the gains and losses of the small self. I contribute everything I have: property, ability, and life!" "I only want to be an unsung hero, dedicating my life to the cause of our Party!"

    In life, my father was very frugal. He never abused his authority to illegally seek personal enjoyment beyond the prescribed supply system, nor did he make the slightest plan for himself. On the contrary, he often generously gave the organization's share to other comrades. During the Long March, he was physically weak, but when the Party found livestock for him to travel on once or twice, he always gave the livestock to others, and walked step by step with a cane. After he became seriously ill last year, he also used the health care funds given to him by the Party to help comrades in need, or to respond to the Party's various calls, donating generously. Even in his final critical illness, when he saw that there was no rain due to drought, he worried about the poor harvest and feared increasing the burden on the people, and he refused to undergo necessary treatment. When getting an injection, he would ask: "How much millet does an injection cost?" When hospitalized, he would calculate how much it cost every day? He wanted to dismiss the special nurse and move to a second-class ward to reduce expenses.

    My father is dead. To realize his aspirations, he contributed everything he had. The regret is: he failed to see the grand ceremony of the founding of New China, and the complete liberation of China; he failed to return to his beloved Jiangnan to see the comrades with whom he shared hardships twenty years ago.

    The broad masses of working people have been liberated under the new regime and have embarked on the road to prosperity through hard work. The ideal of everyone eating meat and wearing silk will surely be realized. Rest in peace! Dear hero! Your name will always live in the memory of your comrades! Live in the memory of the people of Jiangnan!

   ——编者
    父亲安息于首都西郊的墓地，已经一年了。我怀着沉痛的心情，来追忆他的平生，与他优良而值得学习的品质。但因为长期的颠沛离散，我自知人事以后，与父亲相处的时期，仅仅是在他卧病不起、住院疗治的最后两个月。所以我虽是他的同志与女儿，对于他却知道得并不多。
    父亲出生在富裕的地主家庭，本人是大学生。在他没有接受马克思主义以前，他过着不劳而食的寄生生活，乡里的人们，称之谓“三少爷”。一九二五年的大革命浪潮，使父亲思想上起了绝大的变化，他积极地参加了反帝国主义的五卅运动，是最早被捕的十五人之一。其后他毅然背叛了他出身的阶级，加入中国共产党。党教育并改造了父亲。“四一二”蒋介石叛变革命后，在残酷的白色恐怖下，父亲领导农民进行抗租抗税的武装斗争。他自己首先把土地交给农民，不收地租。并领导农民在万分困难危险的情况下同国民党的武装清乡进行斗争。这时他已由农民的朋友，成为江南几县广大农民所热爱的领袖。直到抗战时期，无锡农民还盼望着父亲回家。当时江南无锡一带的党组织就打着“严朴”的旗号，组织起抗日的武装。
    二十五年来，“要解放劳苦大众！”这一坚定的信念，鼓舞了他始终不懈的斗志。他经历过长期艰苦生活的考验。在严重的白色恐怖下，在情况十分险恶的大城市的秘密工作中，在帝国主义牢狱中各种酷刑的摧残下，他一直是勇猛前进，从未丝毫表示气馁与动摇！
    父亲是善于接近群众与团结群众的。由于他的忘我与乐于帮助他人的精神，使他能深知群众的痛苦，而奋不顾身的为革命事业而奋斗！在他参加革命的初期，他挥金如土，在乡人们有灾祸疾病等不可抗拒的困难时，他尽力帮助，毫不吝啬。因此在暑假年假父亲回到乡里的时候，我的家便顿然热闹起来。附近贫苦的老乡，接二连三的来请求父亲解决各种大小问题，许多人哭着来，而笑着回去。随后，他由这种对农民的同情，更进一步，组织与领导农民向地主进行斗争。在一九二七年到一九二八年大革命失败，反革命进行“清剿”，环境最困难的时候，四乡农民曾以他们的力量，他们的智慧，一方面保护我们被难的老小，一方面掩护父亲工作。老农们联合几个庄子，布置警戒，对付军警与地主的武装。在最恶劣的情况中，父亲常常一夜中被农民掩护着转移几个地方。有一次父亲不得已躲进坟山，老婆婆们躲避了地主保卫团的注意，在夜间偷偷地给他送食物。有一位好心的老婆婆将煮熟的鸡蛋，与供神的糕点，装在胸前与腰间，送到父亲跟前，并好奇地发问：“严先生，你家是财主，穿的是绸，吃的是肉，为什么当共产党，吃这苦头，抓住了连性命也不保？”父亲告诉她：为了使天下穷人，人人都能穿绸吃肉，才当共产党。并向她宣传劳动者翻身的道理。老婆婆感动和伤心地哭了。去年五月，当父亲病危时，他温习着这个旧时的记忆，他曾要求大夫容许他吃带壳煮熟的鸡蛋，并强烈地希望自己的病好起来，重回江南，见那避难的所在，与那好心的老婆婆。一九二九年，父亲在上海法南区的黄包车夫中进行工会活动时，他日夜都和黄包车夫们生活在一起。白天和他们一起吃饭，夜晚就和他们一起睡在马路边的人行道上。而他从来没有感到过生活艰苦。
    对同志对下级，父亲是谆谆善诱的。见到人家的长处，那怕是微小的一点进步，他都眉飞色舞地给予鼓励。见到同志的缺点，或屡劝不改，他就难受得流泪。在病危期间，每早有许多实习大夫，随主任大夫查病房。个别年青大夫，离他的病床稍远，或不集中精神听讲，父亲就顶着急。他吃力地摆着手叫：“来！走近一些，站远听不到。”“在我这重病号身上，好好学习，你也摸摸我这鼓起的脾脏，研究为什么？”
    党给父亲以任何艰难的工作，或分配他到任何偏僻苦寒的地方工作，他无一次不是欣然接受，埋头苦干。他从不讨价还价，从不作自私的考虑，去计较“名誉”、“职位”及“生活条件”。他所考虑的，只是如何完成党所给予的任务，如何不辜负党对他的期望。他告我，他常常是很快乐的，“我没有琐碎的不应该有的烦恼，因为我不计较小我的得失。我贡献出我所有的一切：财产，能力，与生命！”“我只愿作个无名英雄，为我们党的事业鞠躬尽瘁！”
    在生活上，父亲是十分刻苦的，他从不在规定的供给制度以外，滥用他的职权，去非法谋取自己生活上的享受，为自己作一丝一毫打算。相反的，他常常把组织上给予他的一份，也慷慨地让予别的同志。在长征途中，他身体病弱，可是当党一两次给他找到牲口代步时，他总是把牲口让给别人，自己扶着一根拐杖，一步步的步行。去年病重之后，党给他的保健费，也拿去帮助有困难的同志，或响应党的各种号召，慷慨地捐助出来。甚至在最后病危时，他看到天旱不雨，担心遭年景，怕增加老百姓负担，还不肯进行必要的治疗。打针时要问：“一针合多少小米？”住院要算每天多少花消？要辞退特别护士，要搬住二等病房，以减轻费用。
    父亲死了，为实现他的志愿，他贡献了他所有的一切。抱憾的是：他未能见到新中国开国的盛典，和中国全部的解放；未能回到他热爱的江南，见到二十年前他患难相共的战友。
    广大劳动群众，在新政权之下，已经获得解放，走上勤劳致富的道路。人人都吃肉穿绸的理想是一定会实现的。安息吧！亲爱的英雄！您的名字，将永远活在同志们的记忆里！活在江南人民的记忆里！
