Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 13th: With the gradual development and deepening of the rural social reform movement, the broad masses of peasants in Hunan Province have been widely organized, laying the foundation for land reform after autumn this year. According to incomplete statistics from late May, among the 14,830 villages in the province, 9,564 villages (accounting for over 64.4% of the total number of villages in the province) have established farmers' association organizations, with a total of 5,730,000 farmer association members, accounting for over 20% of the total population of the province. Among them, in the six special districts of Changsha, Yiyang, Shaoyang, Changde, Hengyang, and Yongzhou, more than 80% to 90% of the villages have established farmers' associations. Rural women in various places have also been initially mobilized. According to statistics from Yiyang and Shaoyang special districts, women account for 20% to 30% of the farmers' association members, and in Changsha special district, they also account for nearly 20%.

This powerful peasant force has been gradually established and developed in the past ten months since the liberation of Hunan through a series of social reform movements and production movements such as suppressing bandits and eliminating secret agents, rent reduction and anti-despot struggles, repairing dikes and preventing floods, and production for disaster relief. In these movements, especially due to the victory of the rent reduction movement, the broad masses of peasants initially recognized the power of organization and understood the principle that "all peasants under heaven are one family," and therefore urgently demanded to be organized. With the development of peasant organizations, the balance of class forces in rural areas has undergone major changes, and the superiority of peasants in rural areas has been initially established. The feudal rule of the landlord class power-holders in rural areas has been initially attacked and weakened.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 13th: The first Hunan Provincial Peasant Representative Conference was held from the 1st to the 5th of this month. Nine hundred and ninety peasant representatives attended. At the beginning of the conference, Cheng Qian, Director of the Hunan Provincial People's Military and Political Committee, Wang Shoudao, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, and Jin Ming, Deputy Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made reports to the representatives. In their reports, they analyzed in detail the situation of the peasant movement in Hunan and pointed out the current tasks, encouraging the peasants of the province to bravely advance on the basis of the existing victories, actively prepare for the implementation of land reform after autumn, and strive for a great turn over in politics, economy, and culture. After discussing the above-mentioned reports, the representatives passed the following resolutions: 1. Actively prepare for the implementation of land reform after autumn; 2. Restore and develop agricultural production, and continue to implement rent reduction and bandit suppression and anti-despot struggles; 3. Strengthen and consolidate the farmers' associations and transform rural political power; 4. Correctly implement the land reform policy, strengthen organization and discipline, and make the movement organized and orderly. The conference adopted the "Regulations on the Organization of Farmers' Associations in the Central and Southern District," which was suggested by the Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China for discussion and adoption in various places, as the "Regulations on the Organization of Farmers' Associations in Hunan," and elected members of the Provincial Farmers' Association, and elected Jin Ming as the chairman of the Provincial Farmers' Association, formally establishing the Hunan Provincial Farmers' Association as a unified leading organ for the peasant movement in the province.

During the conference, military and government organs, people's organizations, and democratic figures in Hunan Province all expressed their enthusiastic support for the peasant emancipation movement. The peasant representatives visited workers in Changsha factories and held a historically significant fraternal gathering between workers and peasants in Hunan.

　　湖南农民广泛组织起来
    全省已有农协会员五百七十余万
    首届全省农民代表会议决定  积极准备秋后实行土地改革
    【新华社长沙十三日电】湖南省广大农民随着农村社会改革运动的逐步开展和深入，已经广泛组织起来，为今年秋后实行土地改革打下了基础。据五月下旬不完全统计，全省一万四千八百三十个村中，已有九千五百六十四个村（占全省总村数的百分之六十四点四强）建立了农民协会的组织，共发展农民协会会员五百七十三万人，占全省总人口的百分之二十强。其中长沙、益阳、邵阳、常德、衡阳、永州等六个专区，已有百分之八十至九十以上的村建立了农民协会。各地农村妇女也已初步发动。据益阳、邵阳两专区统计，农民协会会员中妇女占百分之二十至三十，长沙专区也占将近百分之二十。
    这支强大的农民队伍，是湖南解放后近十个月来在开展农村工作中，逐步建立和发展起来的。本省在解放后曾相继展开了清剿土匪、肃清特务，减租反恶霸，修堤防汛，生产救灾等一系列的社会改革运动和生产运动。在这些运动中，特别是由于减租运动的胜利，广大农民初步认识了组织力量的强大和懂得了“天下农民是一家”的道理，因而迫切地要求组织起来。随着农民组织的发展，农村阶级力量对比已起了重大变化，农民在农村中的优势已初步树立起来，地主阶级当权派在农村中的封建统治，已初步受到打击和削弱。
    【新华社长沙十三日电】湖南省首届农民代表会议已于本月一日至五日举行。出席农民代表九百九十人。会议首由省人民军政委员会主任程潜、省人民政府主席王首道和中共湖南省委副书记金明向到会代表作报告。他们在报告中详尽地分析了湖南农民运动的情况和指出了当前的任务，鼓励全省农民在已有的胜利基础上奋勇前进，积极准备秋后实行土地改革，争取在政治上、经济上、文化上大翻身。到会代表根据上述报告进行讨论后，通过了如下各项决议：一、积极准备秋后实行土地改革；二、恢复和发展农业生产，继续贯彻减租和剿匪反恶霸；三、壮大和巩固农民协会、改造乡村政权；四、正确执行土地改革政策，加强组织性和纪律性，使运动作到有组织有秩序。会议通过接受中共中央中南局建议各地讨论采纳的“中南区农民协会组织章程”为“湖南农民协会组织章程”，同时选出省农民协会委员，并推举金明为省农民协会主席，正式成立了湖南省农民协会，作为全省农民运动的统一领导机关。
    会议进行期间，湖南省各军政机关、人民团体和民主人士均热情地表示支持和拥护农民翻身运动。农民代表们到各工厂访问了长沙市的工人，举行了湖南工人和农民间有历史意义的兄弟联欢。
