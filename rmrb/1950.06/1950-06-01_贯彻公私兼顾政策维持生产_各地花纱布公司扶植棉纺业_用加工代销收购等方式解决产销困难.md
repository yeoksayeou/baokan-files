　　[This News Agency Report] To address the raw material difficulties faced by private cotton textile enterprises, flower, yarn and cloth companies in various regions are systematically implementing the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests, supplying raw cotton, and supporting their reproduction through processing, sales on commission, and purchasing.
　　Within just three days in the early part of this month, the East China District Company sold over 5,500 dan of raw cotton of various grades, most of which were sold to private yarn factories and joint purchasing offices of public-private yarn factories. To further improve the commission spinning business, the company has also made reasonable relaxations in the processing fees, such as raising the commission spinning fee for 20-count yarn from 205 real units to 224 units starting from the 10th. Based on the current yarn price and the cotton exchange ratio, each yarn can be exchanged for 608 jin of cotton, which is 19 jin more than the cotton a manufacturer can obtain by purchasing cotton from the market; if calculated based on the Jin Cheng yarn exchange ratio, it would be even more, up to about 30 jin. In early April, the Subei Branch also signed a commission spinning and weaving contract with Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory, providing over 1,445,500 jin of raw cotton and 868 pieces of raw yarn to help the factory solve difficulties such as raw materials and sales. In order to take care of the factory's actual operating conditions, the stipulated processing fees were much higher than those in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places at the time; and the raw material handling fees and cargo taxes were all borne by the flower, yarn and cloth company. This batch of raw materials can be used to weave 2,657 pieces of Hongkui yarn and more than 31,000 bolts of Peacock cloth, which greatly helps to solve the factory's current production and sales difficulties. At the same time, the company also signed a contract with Haimen Third Factory, which belongs to the factory, providing 615,000 jin of raw cotton and 419 pieces of raw yarn to commission spin 1,080 pieces of Grade A Cai Kui brand cotton yarn weighing 400 pounds and weave 15,000 bolts of 12-pound Yunlong fine cloth, with processing fees calculated according to Shanghai standards and delivered in four installments. To expand sales and support private factories and stores, the Qingdao Flower, Yarn and Cloth Branch has not only directly supplied and sold yarn and cloth in the market but has also established 20 consignment stores one after another, and signed consignment contracts with them, stipulating a commission of 1.5%. From February 1st to May 10th, the consignment stores sold a total of 114,486 bundles of cotton yarn of various brands, 1,834 bundles of cotton cloth, and 1,854 pieces of various printed fabrics. This has played a significant role in recovering currency and supplying the needs of urban and rural areas.
　　The Central South Flower, Yarn and Cloth District Company has taken care of the current production and sales difficulties of private yarn factories in the Han City, and has purchased yarn from various factories at high prices even as market prices continued to fall. For example, on May 6th, the company purchased 607 pieces of yarn of various brands from various factories at high prices, including 587 pieces of 20-count Siping Lotus and Double Chicken yarn exchanged with Shenxin and Yuhua yarn factories for cotton, and 20 pieces of 20-count Double Chicken yarn purchased for 5.5 million yuan in cash. On the 12th, it once again purchased 300 pieces of Green Double Chicken yarn produced by Yuhua Yarn Factory and 100 pieces of Siping Lotus yarn produced by Shenxin. This has greatly helped the capital turnover of the factories.
　　Since March, the North China Flower, Yarn and Cloth Companies at all levels have also made many achievements in supporting the private cotton textile industry in various places to overcome difficulties in the same way. According to statistics for April alone, companies at all levels supported more than 1,500 power looms and nearly 6,200 manual looms to start production in cities such as Tianjin, Beijing, and Taiyuan, and in vast rural areas, delivering more than 3,300 pieces of various yarns per month and producing up to 124,000 bolts of cloth. Producers can receive a total of 4.2 million jin of processed millet.
　　The Northwest Flower, Yarn and Cloth Company was also officially established on the 25th of last month. In the future, under the guidance of the specialized business policy, it will also play a significant role in supporting the cotton textile industry in the Northwest. The company has now established branches in Weinan and other places, and set up cotton purchasing stations in various cotton-producing areas to engage in the purchase, transportation, and sales of flowers, yarn, and cloth, as well as yarn and cloth processing.

　　贯彻公私兼顾政策维持生产
    各地花纱布公司扶植棉纺业
    用加工代销收购等方式解决产销困难
    【本报讯】目前各地花纱布公司为解决私营棉纺业所需原料困难，正有步骤地贯彻公私兼顾政策，供给原棉，并以加工、代销、收购等方式扶植其再生产。
    华东区公司在本月上旬仅三天内即销售各级原棉五、五○○余担，其中大部系售与私营纱厂及公私营纱厂联购处。该公司并为进一步改进代纺业务，特别对工缴部分加以合理放宽，如从十日起曾把过去代纺工缴每件二十支纱为二○五个折实单位，提高到二二四个单位。这样按当前纱价及对棉花的交换比率，每件纱可交换棉花六百零八斤，比之厂商向市场购买棉花每件纱可多得十九斤棉花；如以金城纱交换比率计，则更多至三十斤左右。苏北支公司为帮助南通大生纱厂解决原料、销路等困难，在四月上旬亦曾经以原棉一百四十四万五千余斤，原料纱八百六十八件与该厂签订代纺、代织合同。并为照顾该厂实际经营情况，订定之工缴费远较当时上海、无锡等地为高；而原料搬运费及货物税均统由花纱布公司负担。此批原料共计可代织红魁纱二千六百五十七件，孔雀纱布三万一千多匹，这对解决该厂目前的产销困难帮助极大。同时，该公司又曾以原棉六十一万五千斤，原料纱四百一十九件，与该厂所属海门第三厂签订了代纺四百磅甲级彩魁牌棉纱一千零八十件，代织十二磅云龙细布一万五千匹的合同，工缴费按上海标准计，分四期交货。青岛市花纱布支公司为扩大销路，并扶助私营厂店，除直接在市场供售纱布外，并先后建立了二十家代销店，并与之订立代销合同，规定佣金为百分之一·五。自二月一日到五月十日止，各代销店共推销各牌棉纱一一四、四八六捆，棉布一、八三四捆，各种花色布一、八五四匹。这对回笼货币与供应城乡需要起了很大作用。
    中南花纱布区公司为照顾汉市私营纱厂目前的产销困难，曾在市价继续降落的情况下，分别以高价收购各厂棉纱。如五月六日该公司即以高价向各厂购进各牌纱六百零七件，其中以棉花向申新、裕华两纱厂掉换二十支四平莲及双鸡纱五百八十七件，现款五百五十万价买进二十支双鸡纱二十件。十二日又再度向裕华纱厂收购该厂所出绿双鸡纱三百件，申新出品四平莲纱一百件。这对各该厂资金周转帮助极大。
    华北各级花纱布公司自三月份以来，以同样方式在扶助各地私营棉纺业克服困难方面亦曾做出不少成绩，仅据四月份统计，各级公司在天津、北京、太原等城市及广大农村就扶持了电力机一千五百多台，人力机近六千二百台开工生产，每月交付各种纱三千三百余件，生产布达十二万四千余匹，生产者共可得加工小米四百二十万斤。
    西北花纱布公司亦已于上月二十五日正式成立，今后在专业化的经营方针指导下，对西北的棉纺业生产亦将起很大的扶持作用。现该公司已在渭南等地设支公司，并在各产棉区设收花站，经营花、纱、布的购运、销售及纱、布加工等业务。
