　　Xinhua News Agency, June 26th – The Legislative Affairs Committee of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government has provided the following answers to several questions concerning the implementation of the Marriage Law:

　　Question 1: According to the principle of freedom of marriage, is engagement a necessary procedure for marriage?

　　Answer: Engagement is not a necessary procedure for marriage. Any arranged or forced engagement is invalid. Those who voluntarily engage are allowed to do so. The minimum age for engagement is nineteen for males and seventeen for females. If one party voluntarily cancels the engagement, they may notify the other party to cancel it.

　　Question 2: How should bigamy and concubinage before the implementation of the Marriage Law be handled?

　　Answer: Bigamy and concubinage before the implementation of the Marriage Law can generally be "ignored if not reported"; however, if the woman files for divorce or makes other legitimate demands, the People's Court shall handle it according to law.

　　Question 3: How should child brides before the implementation of the Marriage Law be handled?

　　Answer: For child brides who have not married before the implementation of the Marriage Law, the man's family shall not obstruct them from voluntarily returning home or choosing another spouse, and shall not demand the return of wedding gifts or living expenses consumed during the period as a child bride. If a child bride who has already married files for divorce or makes other legitimate demands, the People's Court shall handle it according to law.

　　Question 4: How should the Marriage Law's prohibition of extorting property in connection with marriage be interpreted?

　　Answer: Extorting property in connection with marriage refers to: open buying and selling of marriages (demanding a certain price for marrying off a daughter or widow, as well as selling women to be wives), or disguised buying and selling of marriages (making the acquisition of certain property from the other party a condition for marriage). Voluntary assistance or gifts from parents or both parties are not prohibited.

　　Question 5: How should the age of marriage be calculated?

　　Answer: The age of marriage can be calculated according to "full years" or according to people's customs by "calendar years". That is, males who are 20 years old or more, and females who are 18 years old or more, or males who have lived for twenty calendar years and females who have lived for eighteen calendar years, may marry. This is the minimum marriage age, and does not preclude men and women from voluntarily raising the marriage age or raising the marriage age in certain special circumstances.

　　Question 6: How should the issue of prohibiting marriage between collateral relatives within five generations be interpreted in accordance with custom?

　　Answer: The prohibition of marriage between collateral relatives within five generations of different or the same generations shall be handled in accordance with the customs of the people. Some marriages between cousins shall also be handled in accordance with the customs of the people.

　　Question 7: What is the content of family property?

　　Answer: Family property mainly consists of the following three types: (1) property of the man and woman before marriage; (2) property acquired during the joint life of the couple (which can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) property acquired through the joint labor of the couple - the wife's labor in taking care of household affairs and raising children should be regarded as labor of equal value to the husband's labor in obtaining living materials. Therefore, the property obtained by the husband's labor should also be considered property obtained through the joint labor of the couple; (2) inheritance obtained by both or one party during this period; (3) property donated to both or one party during this period.); (3) property of minor children (such as land and other property obtained by children in the land reform, etc.).

　　Question 8: What does it mean that both husband and wife have equal rights of ownership and disposal over family property?

　　Answer: This has two meanings: On the one hand, the family property of most Chinese people is formally a mixed property system, that is, the husband and wife jointly own and jointly handle the property without distinction; but in reality, the rights of ownership and disposal are often only in the hands of the husband, and the wife has no right to intervene or has very little right to intervene. According to the principle of equality between men and women and the equal status of husband and wife in the family, both husband and wife have equal rights of ownership and disposal over the aforementioned first and second types of family property; and equal rights of management over the third type of family property. On the other hand, according to the principle of equality between men and women and the equal status of husband and wife in the family, the rights of ownership, disposal and management of any type of family property may be agreed upon voluntarily by both parties.

　　Question 9: Who are illegitimate children?

　　Answer: Illegitimate children refer to: (1) children born from sexual relations between non-marital partners, also known as "illegitimate children" in the old society; (2) children born to concubines under the marital relationships of the old society.

　　Question 10: What does "if mediation fails, a judgment shall be made immediately" mean when one party firmly demands a divorce?

　　Answer: When one party firmly demands a divorce and mediation fails, the county or city People's Court shall make a judgment based on the specific circumstances of each case; if there are legitimate reasons for not being able to continue the marital relationship, a judgment granting the divorce shall be made; otherwise, a judgment denying the divorce may also be made.

　　Question 11: Why can't the husband file for divorce during the wife's pregnancy or within one year after childbirth, while the wife's divorce petition is not restricted?

　　Answer: During the wife's pregnancy or immediately after childbirth, she is already in great pain, both mentally and physically. The fetus or infant is developing and requires the combined efforts of the parents to provide special protection. If the husband files for divorce at this time, the emotional stimulation to the wife will be too great, which will inevitably seriously affect the mother's health and the nurturing of the fetus or infant. Therefore, the Marriage Law prohibits the husband from filing for divorce during this period. If the wife files for divorce during this period, it means that she is in an unbearable situation and should not be restricted. As for a party who intends to kill the other party or has other serious reasons that make it impossible to continue living together, of course, this can be treated as an exception, and an application can be made to the People's Court for appropriate handling.

　　Question 12: Why can children request either divorced parent for living expenses and education expenses exceeding those stipulated in the agreement or judgment?

　　Answer: The agreement or judgment on children's living expenses and education expenses at the time of divorce is often based on the economic situation of both parties at that time. After the divorce, the economic situation of both or one party may change at any time, and sometimes it is necessary to increase the children's living expenses and education expenses. Therefore, the Marriage Law stipulates that it does not preclude children from making requests to either parent for amounts exceeding those originally stipulated in the agreement or judgment.

　　Question 13: Why is the husband's burden heavier for living expenses and education expenses for children and repayment of debts after divorce; if the wife's economic situation is indeed more affluent than the husband's, can the wife's burden be increased as well?

　　Answer: Under the general circumstances in our country at present, the wife's economic ability is not as good as the husband's, and she cannot be completely equal to the husband in terms of obligations, so the husband should bear more economically. If the wife's economic situation is indeed more affluent than the husband's, she can also bear more of the children's living expenses and education expenses than the husband, and can also repay the debts borne during the joint life.

　　Question 14: Why are some flexible or supplementary provisions allowed to be formulated for the marriage issues of ethnic minorities?

　　Answer: The marriage issues of ethnic minorities often contain religious beliefs. For example, some ethnic minority people need to hold religious ceremonies in addition to registering with the People's Government when they marry, which can be taken care of according to the principle of freedom of belief. Therefore, the Central People's Government has instructed the relevant Greater Administrative Areas or Provincial People's Governments to formulate some flexible or supplementary provisions to the Marriage Law and submit them to the State Administration Council for approval and implementation.

　　中央人民政府法制委员会解答
    有关婚姻法施行的若干问题
    【新华社二十六日讯】中央人民政府政务院法制委员会就有关婚姻法施行的若干问题解答如下：
    问题一、根据婚姻自由的原则，订婚是否为婚姻的必要手续？
    答：订婚不是结婚的必要手续。任何包办强迫的订婚，一律无效。男女自愿订婚者，听其订婚。订婚的最低年龄，男为十九岁，女为十七岁。一方自愿取消订婚者，得通知对方取消之。
    问题二、在婚姻法施行前的重婚、纳妾应如何处理？
    答：对于婚姻法施行前的重婚、纳妾，一般的可以“不告不理”；但女方提出离婚或其他合法要求时，人民法院应依法处理。
    问题三、在婚姻法施行前的童养媳如何处理？
    答：在婚姻法施行前未结婚的童养媳，自愿回家或另择配偶者，男家不得阻碍并不得索还婚礼和讨取在童养期间消耗的生活费。已经结婚的童养媳提出离婚或其他合法要求时，人民法院应依法处理。
    问题四、婚姻法禁止借婚姻关系问题索取财物，应如何解释？
    答：所谓借婚姻关系问题索取财物，系指：公开的买卖婚姻（嫁女或嫁寡妇要一定身价，以及贩卖妇女与人为妻等），或变相的买卖婚姻（以索取对方一定的财物为结婚条件者），至于父母或男女双方出于自愿的帮助或赠与，不在禁止之列。
    问题五、结婚年龄应如何计算？
    答：婚姻计算法可以照“满岁”算，也可以照人民的习惯以“年头”算。即男满二十岁、女满十八岁或男二十个年头、女十八个年头，均得结婚。这是最低婚龄的规定，并不妨碍男女自愿提高婚龄或在某些特殊情况下提高婚龄的规定。
    问题六、五代以内的旁系血亲间禁止结婚问题从习惯，应如何解释？
    答：五代以内辈份不同或辈份相同的旁系血亲间禁止结婚的，依人民的习惯办理，其中有些表兄弟姊妹结婚的，也依人民的习惯办理。
    问题七、家庭财产的内容是什么？
    答：家庭财产主要不外下列三种：（一）男女婚前财产；（二）夫妻共同生活时所得的财产（其中大体上可分三类：（１）夫妻共同劳动所得的财产——妻照料家务抚育子女的劳动应与夫获取生活资料的劳动，看作有同等价值的劳动。因此，男方劳动所得财产，亦应认为夫妻共同劳动所得的财产；（２）双方或一方在此时期内所得的遗产；（３）双方或一方在此时期内所得的赠与的财产。）；（三）未成年子女的财产（如土地改革中子女所得的土地及其他财产等）。
    问题八、夫妻双方对于家庭财产有平等的所有权与处理权是什么意思？
    答：这有两方面的意思：一方面的意思是：中国大多数人的家庭财产，形式上是混合财产制，即夫妻不分彼此地共同所有共同处理；但实际上所有权与处理权，往往均只操于男方之手，女方无权过问或很少权利过问。根据男女权利平等和夫妻在家庭中地位平等的原则，夫妻双方对于上述第一种和第二种家庭财产有平等的所有权与处理权；对于第三种家庭财产有平等的管理权。另一方面的意思是：根据男女权利平等和夫妻在家庭中地位平等的原则，夫妻对于任何种类家庭财产的所有权处理权与管理权，均得由双方自愿约定。
    问题九、非婚生子女是指的什么人？
    答：非婚生子女系指：（一）非夫妻关系间发生性行为所生的子女，也即旧社会所谓的“私生子女”。（二）旧社会婚姻关系下的妾所生的子女。
    问题十、一方坚决要求离婚的“如调解无效时，即行判决”是什么意思？
    答：县或市人民法院对于一方坚决要求离婚经调解无效时，应根据每一案件的具体情况，予以判决；有正当原因不能继续夫妻关系的，应作准予离婚的判决；否则也可作不准予离婚的判决。
    问题十一、为什么男方在女方怀孕期间或分娩后一年内不能提出离婚，而女方提出离婚的则可不受限制？
    答：女方怀孕期间或刚分娩后，精神上肉体上本已十分痛苦，胎儿或婴儿正在发育，均须父母合力特加保护，男方如于此时提出离婚，对女方感情上的刺激过大，势必严重地影响母性健康和胎儿或婴儿的保育，所以婚姻法禁止男方于此时期提出离婚。若女方于此时期提出离婚，则是处于忍无可忍的境地，自应不受限制。至于一方对他方有杀害的意图或有其他确实不能继续同居关系的严重原因时，当然可以作为例外，申请人民法院作适当的处理。
    问题十二、为什么子女可以向离婚的父母任何一方请求超过协议或判决所定的生活费和教育费？
    答：离婚时，对于子女生活费和教育费的协议或判决，往往是以当时男女双方的经济情况为依据。离婚后，双方或一方的经济情况随时都有变动的可能，而子女的生活费和教育费有时又确有增加的必要，因之，婚姻法规定不妨碍子女向父母任何一方提出超过协议或判决原定数额的请求。
    问题十三、为什么离婚后对于子女的生活费和教育费及债务的偿还，男方的负担都要重些；如女方的经济情况确比男方充裕时，是否女方的负担也可以加重些？
    答：在我国目前一般的情况下，女方的经济能力不如男方，在义务上还不能与男方完全平等，所以男方在经济上应多负担一些。如女方的经济情况确比男方充裕时，也可负担较男方为多的子女生活费和教育费，也可偿还共同生活时所负担的债务。
    问题十四、对于少数民族的婚姻问题，为什么准许制定某些变通的或补充的规定？
    答：少数民族的婚姻问题，往往参有宗教信仰成份，如某些少数民族人民结婚时除向人民政府进行登记外，还需举行宗教仪式等，可按信仰自由原则加以照顾。故中央人民政府责成有关的大行政区或省人民政府对婚姻法制定某些变通或补充的规定，提请政务院批准施行。
