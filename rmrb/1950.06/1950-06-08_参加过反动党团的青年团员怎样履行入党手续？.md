To the Editor:
    Regarding Communist Youth League members who have previously participated in reactionary organizations, when they are later accepted by the Party (upon meeting the requirements for Party membership), should they still be treated as individuals who participated in reactionary parties and organizations—requiring a probationary period of two years?

    Answer: Article 4 of the Constitution of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League stipulates: General personnel who have withdrawn from reactionary parties, factions, societies, and organizations may join the League with the recommendation of three formal League members or two formal members of the Chinese Communist Party, and are subject to a probationary period of six months to one year, subject to the approval of the County League Committee; those who held more responsible positions in reactionary organizations must be specially reviewed and approved by the Provincial League Committee or higher before they can become League members. This means that the historical background and political quality of Communist Youth League members who have participated in reactionary parties and organizations have been thoroughly investigated by the League during their admission to the League and after joining the League. Therefore, when joining the Party, they can complete the Party membership procedures based on their own social composition, and there is no need to follow the provisions of Item D, Article 4, Chapter 1 of the Party Constitution.

　　参加过反动党团的青年团员怎样履行入党手续？编辑同志：
    曾经参加过反动组织的青年团员，以后在被党所接受时（在具备了入党条件时），是否仍以参加过反动党、团的人员处理——需要候补期二年。
     中央财经委员会图书馆  李园开
    答：中国新民主主义青年团团章第四条规定：脱离反动党、派、社、团的一般人员入团，其手续则须有正式团员三人或中国共产党正式党员两人介绍，半年至一年的候补期，经县团委批准；其在反动组织较为负责的人员，则应经省级以上团委特别审查批准，方得入团为团员。这就是说参加过反动党、团的青年团员，在入团时及入团后，其历史情况及政治品质已为团所考查清楚。因之在入党时按其本人之社会成份履行入党手续即可，不必再按照党章第一章第四条丁项之规定办理。
