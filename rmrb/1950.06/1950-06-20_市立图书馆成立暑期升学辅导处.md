　　Municipal Library
    Establishes Summer College Entrance Counseling Office

    [This newspaper report] To help young people prepare for college entrance exams during the summer vacation, the Municipal Library established a Summer College Entrance Counseling Office last month. It collected information on school profiles and 1949 entrance examination questions for various subjects from middle schools in Beijing and Tianjin, as well as from well-known specialized schools and vocational schools across the country, along with information on this year's summer admissions. The majority of the materials have now been collected and are being sorted out by staff. The library has purchased a large number of reference books for young people preparing for college entrance exams, which will be available for reading and reference in late June.
