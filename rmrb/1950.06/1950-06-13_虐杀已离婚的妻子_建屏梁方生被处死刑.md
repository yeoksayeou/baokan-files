　　Abusing and Killing Divorced Wife
    Liang Fangsheng of Jianping Executed
    [Our Newspaper] The Jianping County People's Court of Hebei Province recently sentenced Liang Fangsheng, a murderer who abused women and killed his divorced wife, to death. The sentence was submitted to and approved by the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, and the execution by firing squad was carried out on April 29th at the Dajue Temple fair in the third district of the county.
    Liang Fangsheng was from Qiandadi Village, Sixth District, Jianping. He was usually violent. After marrying Liu Fengni from Beiying Village, Lingshou County in 1945, the two did not get along, and Liang Fangsheng often beat and verbally abused his wife for no reason. Unable to bear the abuse, Liu Fengni went to the district office in February last year to file for divorce. Upon hearing this, Liang Fangsheng immediately went to the district to find her, forced his wife to return home, and injured her with stones. After Liu Fengni recovered, she went to the district again to request a divorce. After five summonses from the district, Liang Fangsheng intentionally failed to appear. The district office then granted the divorce based on the woman's application and converted her share of the property into eight dou of corn as alimony after the divorce, and notified Liang Fangsheng that if he disagreed with the district's mediation, he could appeal within ten days. At the time, Liang did not express any opinion. On May 25th of last year, Liu Fengni and her younger brother went to Liang's house to collect grain but were refused by Liang. Liu Fengni and others then went to the district again to request a solution. Liang Fangsheng then ambushed Liu Fengni on the way with an axe and killed her. After the incident, Liang fled for a time, returned home several days later, was discovered by villagers, and sent to the district office for transfer to the county People's Court for legal action. After trial, the People's Court sentenced the perpetrator to death.
    In order to educate the masses, before executing Liang Fangsheng, the county People's Court announced the facts and charges of Liang Fangsheng's abuse and murder of women at a temple fair attended by more than 3,000 people in the third district of the county. The director of the district women's federation also explained the meaning of the Marriage Law at the meeting, calling on everyone to implement the policy of freedom of marriage and to fight against the feudal marriage system and the act of abusing women.

　　虐杀已离婚的妻子
    建屏梁方生被处死刑
    【本报讯】河北省建屏县人民法院近判处虐待妇女、杀害已离婚妻子的凶犯梁方生死刑，已呈经中央人民政府最高人民法院批准，于四月二十九日在该县三区大觉寺庙会上执行枪决。
    梁方生为建屏六区前大地村人，平素性情暴戾，一九四五年与灵寿县北营村刘凤妮结婚后，双方感情不洽，梁方生时常无理殴打辱骂其妻。刘凤妮因不堪虐待，于去年二月间往区公所诉请离婚，梁方生闻讯，立即赴区寻找，强迫其妻回家，并以石块将其击伤。刘凤妮伤愈后，又到区提出离婚要求，经区连传五次，梁方生故意不到，区公所便根据女方申请，准其离婚，并将她应分得的一份财产折成玉茭八斗为离婚后赡养费用，一面通知梁方生，如不同意区方调处，可在十天内上告。当时梁并未表示意见。至去年五月二十五日，刘凤妮和其弟往梁家取粮，遭梁拒绝，刘凤妮等乃再度到区请求解决。梁方生竟持斧预伏途中将刘凤妮杀死。事发后，梁曾一度逃跑，数日后回家，被村人发觉，被送区公所转送县人民法院法办。人民法院审讯结果，判处了该犯死刑。
    为了教育群众，该县人民法院在枪决梁方生前，曾在该县三区大觉寺三千余人的庙会上宣布了梁方生虐杀妇女的事实与罪状；区妇联主任并在会上解释了婚姻法的意义，号召大家贯彻婚姻自由政策，向封建婚姻制度与虐待妇女的行为作斗争。（永明、星焯、张植）
