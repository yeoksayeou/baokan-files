　　Seeing Opportunities from Difficulties
    Government and Industrial and Commercial Operators Should Seize Favorable Conditions
    Yu Huancheng
    From March to May this year, in a short period of just over two months, we experienced a peaceful revolution, an economic revolution, a revolution against the speculative hoarding caused by the inflation left over by the twelve years of reactionary government. After this revolution, many favorable conditions for economic construction were created: stable prices and low interest rates are the most important favorable conditions for industry and commerce, and near-balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure and the large-scale control of daily necessities are important favorable conditions for the government. The people of the whole country have escaped the abyss of inflation and embarked on the right track of economic construction. To achieve such results in such a short period is truly beyond our expectations and an unprecedented achievement in monetary history.

    This victory demonstrates the great determination of the Central People's Government and the effectiveness of the People's Government; therefore, it was able to achieve financial and economic unification in a very short period. Secondly, the farmers across the country worked hard to complete the task of paying public grain, enabling the government to control a large amount of materials. Industrial and commercial workers and the general public worked hard to complete the tasks of tax collection and public bond subscriptions, bringing back a large amount of currency. "Easy success is actually hard work." We have achieved such good results, and we must consolidate these results and continue to develop this achievement.

    In the process of financial and economic unification, the payment of public grain, the collection of taxes, and the raising of public bonds took a lot of effort and aroused a lot of doubts, and there were many difficulties in the middle. The difficulties are real: in the great era of transformation, the abnormal development and morbid prosperity, the transformation of bones and forms, inherently have inevitable difficulties. Added to this is the temporary recession from the stage of inflation to stability, which is inevitable. Capitalist countries must go through a period of recession when they change their monetary systems, as there are precedents in monetary history. Our country's termination of false purchasing power has caused prices to fall, forming a temporary stagnation of commodities, which is of course a kind of pain. It's like using surgery to treat a serious illness; without surgery, life cannot be saved, and surgery inevitably causes some pain. Ancient books also said: "If the medicine does not cause dizziness, the disease will not be cured." Dizziness means vertigo. Taking strong medicine will cause dizziness, but to cure the disease, one must take dizzying medicine. The difficulties faced by industry and commerce are the pain of surgery and the dizziness of strong medicine. Only in this way can they save their lives, let alone restore health and improve health.

    We do not deny that some industrialists and businessmen have withdrawn funds, or even incurred debts, to pay taxes and debts, which of course is a considerable loss. However, compared with the losses caused by price fluctuations and high interest rates, the former losses are limited, while the latter losses are infinite, the former losses are partial, while the latter losses are overall, and the former losses are light and easy to recover, while the latter losses are huge and get deeper and deeper. Comparing the two, industry and commerce should welcome famous doctors and national experts to perform surgery and administer strong medicine to treat chronic diseases that have not been cured for many years. Now it has indeed begun to show spring and has seen obvious and great effects. After that, conditioning and supplementation can not only restore health but also improve health.

    The government has already paid attention to conditioning and supplementation, convening conferences of directors of industry and commerce bureaus and tax conferences to determine plans and medicines. Matters such as ordering, purchasing, loans, processing, public-private adjustments, labor-capital consultations, and tax improvements are all for the purpose of conditioning and supplementing industry and commerce, proceeding in a planned and step-by-step manner. The future development is proper, not abnormal, and the future prosperity is healthy, not morbid.

    Some people believe that reorganizing the monetary system is extremely difficult, so they doubt our current situation of currency stability. After the First European War, Britain and France restored the gold standard, but they could not maintain it for many years. After the Second World War, the currencies of capitalist countries are still swaying, such as the devaluation of the pound last year. After the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, it took two or three years of implementing the New Economic Policy to stabilize the monetary system. Now, our country has not yet ended the War of Liberation, and it is truly unprecedented to stabilize the currency in a very short period. I think there is no need to worry so much, as long as you understand the following conditions: (1) New Democracy is different from the nature of capitalist countries; the monetary system of capitalist countries only takes into account the interests of the exploiting class. Whether they are precious metal currencies or managed currencies, the government cannot control materials and cannot control import and export trade. Especially in terms of finance, in order to plunder and compete for colonial interests, military equipment is expanded without restriction, which is always unsustainable. Although our time is short, we have been able to control major important materials, control national trade, and approach a balance in fiscal revenue and expenditure. The austerity and frugality of our military and administrative expenses are unimaginable for capitalist countries. After we liberate Tibet and Taiwan, we can greatly save military expenses. (2) The situation in the Soviet Union at that time was also different from that of our country; after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, the White bandits were rampant, and imperialism attacked from all sides. After fighting hard for more than two years, the White bandits were finally suppressed and the imperialists were driven out. The domestic destruction was much more serious than ours, so the economic recovery time was longer. China has less destruction than the Soviet Union and recovers faster. There is also a special convenience: the Soviet Union was the first socialist country, and everything was created independently, without help. We can learn from the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and we can also get help from the Soviet Union, saving a lot of detours, and more than doubling our efforts. Therefore, it is absolutely certain to stabilize currency and prices, and there is no need to worry.

    Of course, we must work harder in the future. The fruits of victory were obtained after some difficulties, but they are still preliminary. The government must do a better job in achieving a real balance of revenue and expenditure and even have a surplus. Industry and commerce must follow the government's guidance, and supply and marketing issues, labor-capital issues, capital issues, technical issues, democratic management issues, etc., must be further resolved. We must also take into account the financial tasks, guarantee military and administrative supplies, and meet the needs of developing production and construction. The industrial and commercial sectors should be consistent with the government in implementing comprehensive planning and consideration.

    There is no doubt that the people of the whole country have seen the turning point. Today's turning point is not the old saying of "the darkest hour is before the dawn" or "after suffering comes sweetness," but a great transformation of an era: a dying patient begins to transform into a lively and strong young hero. The semi-feudal and semi-colonial industry and commerce begin to transform into free, independent, and new democratic industry and commerce. All of these confirm that the saying "difficulties in victory, difficulties in progress" is absolutely correct.

### 从困难中见到转机  政府及工商业者都应把握有利条件

　　从困难中见到转机
    政府及工商业者都应把握有利条件
    俞寰澄
    从今年三月到五月，短短的两个多月期间，我们经过了一次平和的革命，是经济革命，是革了十二年反动政府遗留的通货膨胀引起投机囤积的命。经此革命后，造成许多经济建设有利条件：物价稳定，利息低落，是工商业最重要的有利条件，财政收支接近平衡，日用物资大量控制，是政府重要的有利条件。全国人民，脱离了通货膨胀的沉渊，走上了经济建设的正轨。在这样短时期内，得到这样的成果，真是我们意想不到，亦是货币史上从未有过的创举。
    这次胜利，表示中央人民政府极大的英断，与人民政府的效能，因此，能在极短时期，就做到财经统一。其次是全国农民，努力完成了缴纳公粮的任务，使政府得控制大量物资。工商业工人及一般人民，努力完成了税收及公债的任务，使大批通货回笼。“成如容易却艰辛”，我们得到了这样好的成果，我们必须巩固这成果，我们还须继续发展这种成绩。
    在财经统一过程中，缴纳公粮、征取税收、募集公债，曾费了不少的力量，亦惹起了不少的疑虑，中间还有不少的困难。困难是真的：大时代转变中，畸形的发展，病态的繁荣，换骨易形，本来有不可避免的困难。加上了从通货膨胀到稳定阶段的暂时的不景气，这个暂时的不景气是不可避免的。资本主义国家改定币制，必经过一段不景气时期，货币史上，著有先例。我们国家由于结束了虚伪的购买力，使物价下落，形成暂时的商品滞销，当然是一种痛苦。仿佛治重病之用手术，不开刀保不了身命，开刀总不免受点痛苦。古书上亦说过：“若药弗瞑眩，厥疾弗瘳”。瞑眩是眩晕的意思，服猛剂会使人眩晕，然要治好病，非服眩晕之剂不可。工商业所受的困难，是开刀的痛苦，猛剂的眩晕，非如此不能保全身命，更不能恢复健康与增进健康。
    我们不否认有些工商业家曾经抽出资金，甚至于负了债，来纳税缴债，这当然是有相当损失的。然较诸物价波动的损失，高利贷的损失，则前者的损失有限，而后者的损失无穷，前者的损失是局部的，后者的损失是全体的，前者的损失轻而容易恢复，后者的损失巨而愈陷愈深。两两相比，工商业应该欢迎名医国手来开刀，来下猛剂，疗治多年不愈的沉疴痼疾。现在果然著手成春，已见明效大验，此后调理补养，不但可以恢复健康，而且可以增进健康。
    政府已经注意到调理补养，召开工商局长会议，税务会议，来定方案与药剂。关于定购、收购、贷款、加工、公私调整、劳资协商、捐税改进等事，都是为工商业调理补养，有计划有步骤地进行。以后的发展，是正当的不是畸形，以后的繁荣，是健康的不是病态。
    有人以为整理币制，是极不容易之事，因此怀疑我们现在通货稳定的局面。第一次欧战之后，英法恢复金本位，不多几年就都维持不住。第二次世界大战后，资本主义国家的货币，到现在尚摇荡不定，如英镑去年又贬值了。苏联十月革命后，经施行新经济政策二三年，才稳定币制。今我国解放战争尚未终止，在极短促时期内，就要把通货稳住，真是史无前例。我以为是不必如此顾虑的，只要了解了以下的条件就行了：（一）新民主主义与资本主义国家性质不同；资本国家的币制，只顾到剥削阶级的利益，不管他们是贵金属通货，或管理通货，政府均不能控制物资，不能掌握出入口贸易。尤其是财政方面，为掠夺及互争殖民地利益，无限制扩张军备，这样总是入不敷出。我们时间虽短，已能控制大宗重要物资，管制全国贸易，接近财政收支平衡。我们军政费的刻苦节约，是资本主义国家所梦想不到的。在我们解放西藏台湾之后，更可大大的节省军费。（二）苏联当时与我国情况也不同；苏联十月革命之后，白寇鸱张，帝国主义四面环攻，苦战两年余，方才削平白寇，赶出帝国主义，国内的破坏，比我们利害得多，所以经济恢复时间较长。我国比苏联破坏少，恢复快。还有一种特别便益，苏联是第一个社会主义国家，事事戛戛独造，没有帮助。我们可以借镜苏联及东欧新民主国家，而且得到苏联帮助，省绕不少弯子，何止事半功倍。所以稳住通货与物价，是绝对有把握的，用不着顾虑。
    当然，此后须更加努力。胜利成果，经过几许困难，然后得到，然而还是初步。政府更要做到收支实在平衡而且有余，工商业遵从政府指导，供销问题，劳资问题，资金问题，技术问题，民主管理问题等，千头万绪，都要更进一步求得解决。更要顾到财政任务，保障军政供给，与发展生产建设的需要，工商界应同政府一致实行兼筹并顾。
    毫无问题，现在全国人民都已看到了转机。今日的转机，不是“否极泰来”“苦尽还甘”的旧话，而是一个划时代的大转变：是奄奄待尽的病夫，开始转变为活泼壮健的青年好汉。半封建半殖民地的工商业，开始转变为自由独立新民主的工商业。这些都证实了“胜利中的困难，进步中的困难”的说法是万分正确的。
