Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch from Moscow by TASS: The "Truth" newspaper commentator, Marinin, recently wrote a commentary on the recent declaration by the US, British, and French governments regarding the arming of Near Eastern countries, stating that this declaration is one of the blatant and shameless revelations of the US-British imperialist aggression plan.

It has long been known that Britain supplies Egypt, Iraq, and Transjordan with arms, while the United States is also supplying arms to Israel. The US military mission stationed in Israel is "reorganizing" the Israeli army and is establishing a network of military bases.

Obviously, the "Tripartite Declaration" is a smokescreen intended to conceal their plans to peddle war. This plan aims to militarize the Near East on a larger scale and more rapidly, turning it into a US-British military bridgehead. The next step in "overall diplomacy" in the region will apparently be to hastily piece together a Near Eastern bloc.

Marinin then pointed out the growing internal contradictions within the US-British group in the Near East. The United States, by independently assuming responsibility for militarizing Arab countries, has squeezed out Britain, and only gives Britain the possibility of "symbolic participation" in supplying weapons to Israel. Marinin concluded: Thus, the "Tripartite Declaration" conceals the conflicts within the camp of war peddlers and will inevitably lead to a further deterioration of the situation in the Near East. It increases the threat of the US-British imperialist bloc to the vital interests and security of Near Eastern countries. Therefore, the people of Near Eastern countries face a more urgent task—to thwart the aggression plans of the war peddlers and unite with the peaceful and democratic camp that is fighting under the great banner of peace and friendship among nations.

　　美英法阴谋加紧侵略近东
    扬言要武装各国反动政府 
    真理报评论：三国宣言掩饰战贩阵营的冲突，必将导致近东情势更加恶化。    
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报外交评论员马里宁顷著文评论最近美英法三国政府关于武装近东各国的宣言称，这个宣言是直言不讳地、无耻地显露出美英帝国主义侵略计划的文件之一。
    大家老早就知道：英国供应埃及、伊拉克和外约旦以军火，而美国也正在供应军火给以色列。驻以色列的美国军事使团，正在“改组”以色列的军队，并且正在建立军事基地网。
    非常明显地，《三国宣言》乃是一个烟幕，企图掩饰他们贩卖战争的计划。这一计划要更大规模地、更迅速地使近东军国主义化，使近东变成美英的军事桥头堡垒。“总体外交”在该地区的下一步骤，显然将是赶忙拚凑起近东集团。
    马里宁继而指出美英集团对近东的日益加剧的内部矛盾。美国自行担负了军事化阿拉伯国家的责任，已将英国排挤掉，而在输送武器给以色列方面，仅给英国“象征性参加”的可能性。马里宁结语说：这样，《三国宣言》掩饰着战争贩子阵营中的冲突，并且将不可避免地导致近东情势的更加恶化。它增加了美英帝国主义集团对近东国家的切身利益与安全的威胁。因此，近东各国的人民面临更加紧急的任务——挫败战争贩子的侵略计划，并与正在和平与各民族友谊的伟大旗帜下斗争的和平民主阵营联合起来。
