　　Suburban Beijing Wheat is About to Ripen
    Villages Actively Prepare for Harvesting
    Suburban Committee Mobilizes Farmers to Conduct Field Seed Selection
    [Our Newspaper] Suburban Beijing wheat is about to ripen, and villages are actively preparing for wheat harvesting and summer planting. From the end of May to the beginning of June, each district convened joint meetings of village chiefs, agricultural association directors, security officers, and Party and Youth League branch secretaries to arrange for crop watching, seed selection, threshing ground preparation, and autumn planting. Currently, each village has established crop watching organizations under the leadership of the village production committee, with wheat farmers voluntarily participating to help guard the wheat fields. Recently, incidents of wheat seedling damage were discovered in the eastern suburbs, which has aroused the vigilance of farmers. Therefore, everyone supports the method of mutual assistance in watching the wheat.
    In the past, farmers in suburban Beijing mostly did not have the habit of field seed selection. During this seed selection promotion, some farmers reflected: "Seed selection in the threshing ground is okay, but seed selection in the field is too troublesome." However, seed selection in the threshing ground makes it difficult to maintain the purity of the variety, and diseased seeds can mix in, resulting in less effective results. This year, at the end of May, the Municipal Government Suburban Committee concentrated some district cadres to study seed selection under the guidance of experts from the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute. Subsequently, they went to various districts to promote seed selection work. Currently, in conjunction with the situation of wheat yellowing and other diseases in the suburbs this spring, in-depth promotion of field seed selection is being conducted. Five hundred students from the Agricultural University are helping farmers select seeds in seven villages in Fengtai District, including Weicun, Xiaotun, and Tiangezhuang, and organizing village cadres to visit the university's farm. Farmers, seeing the excellent varieties cultivated through seed selection, strengthened their understanding of field seed selection. Each village requested to exchange for excellent wheat seeds from the farm after the wheat harvest. At present, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute has sent personnel to the northern suburbs (where excellent wheat seeds were lent last autumn) to experiment with seed selection, and has selected Xiliucun, Zhufang, and Xierqi as key working areas.
    This year, there is generally no shortage of summer planting fertilizer. Judging from six villages and streets in the eastern suburbs, Qishengmiao, Nanmofang, Guangqumen, Houfengcun, Dajiaoting, and Dongbianmen, each mu of wheat stubble land can be fertilized with 1.5 to 2 cartloads of fertilizer this year. In previous years, the maximum was only one cartload, and some didn't even average one cartload. The six villages will also solve the problem of seed shortage through private exchange and adjustment methods to ensure a solution.

    [Our Newspaper] Villages such as Dajiaoting, Nanmofang, and Qishengmiao in the 13th District of suburban Beijing have prepared more than a dozen threshing grounds, solving the difficulty for newly emancipated poor peasants and hired laborers who lacked threshing yards. In the past, when Dajiaoting village hired people to pull wheat, they had good meals and drank wine, resulting in great waste. Now, the mutual aid group in the village has discussed and stipulated: pulling one mu of wheat, regardless of meals, pays ten jin of corn as wages. Everyone supports this very much. The six villages of Dajiaoting, etc., have prepared to plant sweet potatoes on one-third of the vacant land after the wheat harvest, and late corn on two-thirds of the cultivated land. In order to solve the problem of seed shortage for newly emancipated households, private exchanges and mutual adjustments are advocated. Qishengmiao has made preparations.

    [Our Newspaper] Farmers in Liulangzhuang in the 16th District of suburban Beijing are vigorously撈蝗卵 (lao huang luan = lit. salvage locust eggs - 打捞捞蝗卵 is more like scoop up locust eggs which are floating on the water) after flooding rice paddies to prevent locust plagues, and have now捞蝗卵 more than two hundred jin. After flooding rice paddies, locust eggs float on the water surface, and after being blown by the wind, they gather near the fields or rice stalks, making them very easy to捞蝗卵. In previous years, no one捞蝗卵. Farmers said: "In previous years, the land belonged to others, and it wouldn't help even if one or two households捞蝗卵.” This year, after land reform, farmers have a high enthusiasm for production; the village farmers' representative meeting also passed a plan for the whole village to take action to eliminate pests and prevent disasters. At present, the village Party and Youth League branches and the village government are actively leading farmers to捞蝗卵. It is estimated that if nine hundred jin can be捞蝗卵, three, four, five and six mu of rice land in the village can be protected from locust plagues, further guaranteeing the plan to increase production by one thousand dan of rice.

### 京郊小麦即将成熟  各村积极准备收割  郊委会正动员农民进行田间选种

　　京郊小麦即将成熟
    各村积极准备收割
    郊委会正动员农民进行田间选种
    【本报讯】京郊小麦即将成熟，各村正积极准备麦收、夏种。各区在五月底到六月初，分别召开了村长、农会主任、治安员、党、团支书联席会，布置看青、选种、预备打场、种秋等工作。现各村均在村生产委员会领导下成立了看青组织，由种麦户自愿参加，互助看守麦田。最近东郊区曾发现麦苗遭受破坏事件，已引起农民的警惕。因此，大家对互助看麦的办法很拥护。
    过去京郊农民多无田间选种习惯。这次宣传选种时，有的农民反映：“场里选种还可以，地里选种太麻烦。”但场内选种，品种不易保纯，病种杂入，收效较小。今年市府郊委会在五月底即集中部分区干部，在华北农业科学研究所专家指导下，学习选种。嗣后，即分赴各区推动选种工作。现正结合今春郊区小麦黄疸等病害情况，深入宣传田间选种。农业大学五百同学，在丰台区魏村、小屯、田各庄等七村帮助农民选种，组织各村干部到该校农场参观。农民看到经过选种培育出来的优良品种，加强了田间选种的认识。各村要求在麦收后，向农场换取优良麦种。目前华北农业科学研究所已派员赴北郊（去秋贷放了优良麦种）实验选种，已择定西柳村、朱房、西二旗为工作重点。
    今年夏种肥料一般不缺，从东郊七圣庙、南磨房、广渠门、厚俸村、大郊亭、东便门六个村、街来看，今年每亩麦楂地可上肥一车半到两车。往年最多不过一车，有的一车还平均不上。该六村对缺少种籽的，也将以私人换种调剂办法，保证解决。

    【本报讯】京郊十三区大郊亭、南磨房、七圣庙等村已准备下十几个场，解决了翻身户贫雇农缺乏场院的困难。大郊亭村往年找人拔麦时，吃好饭，喝酒，浪费很大。现在该村互助组讨论规定：拔一亩麦，不管饭，给十斤玉米工资。大家都很拥护。大郊亭等六村，已准备在麦收后的空白地里，以三分之一的面积种白薯，三分之二的耕地种晚玉米。为解决新翻身户缺乏种籽问题，提倡私人对换，互相调剂。七圣庙已作了准备工作。

    【本报讯】京郊十六区六郎庄农民为防止蝗灾，在稻田放水后，大力打捞蝗卵，现已捞出二百余斤。稻田放水后，蝗卵浮于水面，经风一吹，聚拢田边或稻梗左近，很容易捞。往年是没人捞的。农民说：“往年地是人家的，一两户捞了也不顶事。”今年经过土地改革，农民生产情绪很高；村农民代表会又通过了全村动手，除虫防灾计划。目前该村党、团支部和村政府正积极领导农民打捞蝗卵。预计如能捞出九百斤即可使对该村三、四五六亩稻地免受蝗害，进一步保证了增产千石大米的计划。
