　　Crushing the Imperialist Sinister Conspiracy
    Czechoslovakia Sentences Thirteen Traitors

    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th] Comprehensive TASS dispatch from Prague: The Czechoslovak National Court publicly tried thirteen traitors from May 31st to June 8th. They were Nĕsְtaval, a former member of the Central Committee of the National Socialist Party; Golakova, Zimminova, Kleinaroova, active members of the party; Jiida, a former manufacturer; and former Social Democratic Party members and other reactionaries.

    The trial confirmed that the defendants organized a counter-revolutionary secret center, plotting to stage an uprising in 1949, subvert the people's democratic regime, and restore capitalism. The organization also frequently engaged in espionage activities, collecting state secrets related to politics and economics and sending them to foreign intelligence agencies. The activities of the secret center were led by Zanker and Lipka, former leaders of the National Socialist Party, imperialist running dogs who fled abroad during the February events. Certain diplomatic representatives from the United States, Britain, France, Tito's Yugoslavia, as well as Belgium, Norway, and Sweden, all participated in their criminal activities, with American diplomatic spies acting as the commander-in-chief.

    The prosecutor delivered a concluding speech in court on the 8th, pointing out that this trial once again proved the attempt by American imperialists to interfere in Czechoslovakia's internal affairs. All the defendants endangered Czechoslovakia's independence and used their criminal plans to cooperate with the imperialists' preparation for a war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The prosecutor stated: We have received nearly two thousand telegrams from the working people, demanding severe punishment for these criminals.

    The National Court pronounced its verdict on the 8th. Defendants Golakova, Buchal, Karlandra, and Peelker were sentenced to death. Neshtaval, Jiida, Kleinaroova, and Prusursil were sentenced to life imprisonment. The remaining five were sentenced to prison terms ranging from twenty-eight to fifteen years, and were fined between 500,000 crowns (Czech currency) and 15,000 crowns respectively. All property of the defendants was confiscated, and they were deprived of their civil rights.

    Soviet News Agency reporter Bulgakov commented on this espionage trial: The trial demonstrates the new victory achieved by the working people of Czechoslovakia in the struggle to consolidate the people's democratic regime. At the same time, nine million five hundred thousand citizens of Czechoslovakia have signed the Stockholm Declaration of the Standing Committee, which is the best answer to the warmongers.

　　粉碎帝国主义罪恶阴谋
    捷判处十三名叛国犯
    【新华社十五日讯】综合塔斯社布拉格讯：捷克斯洛伐克国家法庭于五月三十一日至六月八日，公开审判了十三名叛国罪犯。他们是前民族社会党中央委员会委员涅斯达瓦尔、该党积极分子戈拉科瓦、齐米诺瓦、克莱伊纳罗娃、前制造商吉伊达，以及前社会民主党分子和其他反动分子。
    审讯证实：被告等组织了反革命的秘密中心，曾图谋在一九四九年举行暴动，颠覆人民民主政权，恢复资本主义。该组织并经常进行间谍活动，搜集有关政治、经济的国家机密情报送给外国谍报机关。秘密中心的活动系由二月事件时逃亡国外的帝国主义走狗、前民族社会党首领赞克尔和李普卡领导。美国、英国、法国、南斯拉夫铁托以及比利时、挪威和瑞典的若干驻捷外交代表均参与其犯罪活动，而由美国外交间谍担任总指挥。
    检察官于八日在法庭上发表总结演说，指出这次审讯再次证明了美国帝国主义者企图干涉捷克斯洛伐克的内政。各被告都危害捷克斯洛伐克的独立，而以其罪恶计划来配合帝国主义者准备进攻苏联和人民民主国家的战争。检察官称：我们已接到近两千件的劳动人民的来电，要求严厉惩处这些罪犯。
    国家法庭于八日宣判。判处被告戈拉科瓦、布恰尔、卡朗德拉和彼克尔等四人以死刑。判处涅斯达瓦尔、吉伊达、克莱伊纳罗娃和普尔苏西尔等四人以无期徒刑，其余五人被判处为期二十八年至十五年不等的徒刑，并分别科以五十万克朗（捷币）至一万五千克朗不等的罚金。各被告的全部财产均予以没收，并褫夺其公权。
    苏联消息报记者布尔加科夫评论此次间谍审讯称：审讯说明了捷国劳动人民在巩固人民民主政权的斗争中所取得的新的胜利。与此同时，捷克斯洛伐克九百五十万公民已在和大常委会斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名，这是给予战争贩子的最好的回答。
