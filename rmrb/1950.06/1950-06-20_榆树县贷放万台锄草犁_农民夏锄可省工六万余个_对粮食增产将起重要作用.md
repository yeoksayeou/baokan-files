　　Yushu County Loans Out 10,000 Weeding Ploughs
    Farmers Save Over 60,000 Workdays in Summer Weeding, Playing a Significant Role in Increasing Grain Production
    [Shenyang News] Northeast Daily News: Yushu County, a famous grain-producing area in Northeast China, is now lending out 10,500 high-crop weeding and soil-cultivating ploughs to improve agricultural technology and increase production. This work began to be planned this spring, and through repeated publicity and education through labor model conferences, people's representative conferences, etc., preparations were made in the minds of farmers. At the same time, special training classes were opened to enable district and village cadres and mutual aid team leaders to fully learn the usage techniques. Zhang Weifan, a provincial labor model from the 15th Village of the 8th District, also used his horse to give demonstrations to farmers in the nearby area. Under the lead of model workers, cadres, and party members, more than 10,000 high-crop weeding and soil-cultivating ploughs in the county have been borrowed by farmers throughout the county. It is estimated that this batch of improved agricultural implements will save more than 60,000 workdays compared to previous years after being put into summer weeding, and will play an important role in increasing the county's grain production by 90,000 tons this year.
    [Report from our correspondent Zhen Linfeng in Dehui County, Jilin] The 200 high-crop weeding and soil-cultivating ploughs lent to Dehui County by the People's Bank of Jilin Province were transported to the county on April 30th and have been distributed to key villages and groups in fourteen districts, mostly borrowed by mutual aid groups. The district party committees and district people's governments in each district have personally experimented with them and taught the farmers how to use them. On the morning of May 28th, the county magistrate, the county party committee, more than 260 people's representatives who were attending a meeting in the county, and 300 mutual aid team leaders personally experimented with the improved weeding plough with livestock. Finally, they also tested the double-wheeled single-row improved harrow invented by Mr. Liu Zhongcheng, an elderly man from Xiushui Village, Chengzijie District, in the county. This kind of harrow saves labor compared to the old-style harrow and can also filter manure. The mutual aid team leaders and representatives expressed great welcome to this kind of harrow and repeatedly visited and experimented with it. They also requested that construction be started as soon as possible so that they could be distributed to the various groups and villages for use as soon as possible. The county's leading organs are carefully studying it and will report it to the province for approval soon so that it can be manufactured on a large scale.

　　榆树县贷放万台锄草犁
    农民夏锄可省工六万余个  对粮食增产将起重要作用
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北著名产粮区的榆树县，为提高农业技术，增加生产，现正进行贷放一万零五百台高作除草培土犁的工作。这一工作从今春开始酝酿，通过劳模大会、人民代表会等反复宣传教育，在农民思想上作好准备。同时开了专门训练班，使区村干部及互助组长完全学会了使用技术。八号区十五号村省劳模张维范，又用自己的马拉着在附近试验给农民看。在模范、干部、党员带头示范下，现全县万余台高作除草培土犁即被全县农民如数贷去。据估计，今年这一批改良农具投入夏锄后，全县较往年可省工六万余个，并可实行四铲四趟，这对今年全县增产九万吨粮食，将起重要作用。
    【本报吉林德惠讯】特约通讯员甄林风报告：吉林省人民银行贷给德惠县的二百台高作锄草培土犁，于四月三十日运到县后，已有重点的发到十四个区的重点村和小组，多为互助小组贷去。各区中共区委和区人民政府大都亲自试验，教会农民使用。五月二十八日早晨，该县县长、中共县委、和正在县里开会的二百六十多位人民代表以及三百名互助组长，亲自用牲口拉着改良锄草犁试验研究。最后又试验了该县城子街区秀水村刘忠诚老先生发明的双轮单拢改良耲耙。这种耲耙比旧式耲耙省工，还能滤粪。互助组长和代表们对这种耲耙极表欢迎，都反复进行参观和试验。并纷纷要求快开工制造，以便早日发到各组各村使用，现该县领导机关正在仔细研究，最近报省批准后，即可大量制造。
