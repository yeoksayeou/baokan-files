　　Ministry of Heavy Industry Instructs North China Ceramics Company
    Be Vigilant Against Bureaucratic Work Style, Remember Lessons and Seek Further Improvement
    [Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government issued an instruction to the North China Ceramics Company on June 13th. The full text is as follows:
    The May production performance of the Liulihe Cement Plant exceeded the highest record since 1944 under the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang, and the liberation. Cement production exceeded the plan by 28.5%, and clinker exceeded the plan by 18%. The employees were united as never before, overcoming various difficulties, and their enthusiasm for production was high. This proves that since the organization of a working group to work in the plant at the end of March, coupled with the efforts of all the plant's employees, the above achievements have been obtained.
    It should be pointed out that in the past, the company had a serious bureaucratic work style in its leadership: lack of self-criticism, emphasis on the age of the machines (age is also a fact), lack of going deep into the grassroots, mobilizing the masses, and relying on the working class to overcome difficulties and improve production. Therefore, for a long time after the takeover, the factory's production did not improve much. Especially at the end of last year and in January this year, the factory was in a serious situation. Cement production only completed 8.28% of the plan, and clinker 56.8%. The machines suffered serious malfunctions (more than 30 large and small malfunctions occurred in January and February alone). After the situation became serious, the company's work on the factory was still the same old set of paperwork leadership; when reporting to the Ministry, the true internal situation (such as the serious disunity of cadres) was rarely mentioned; the failure to complete production tasks was not reviewed from the leadership and your work, but only emphasized the age of the machines, the large plans, and other such reasons. This kind of official report that cannot reflect the true internal situation did not attract your attention until the Ministry repeatedly pointed out that a comprehensive report was needed and sent someone to inspect it. It should be pointed out that this set of bureaucratic work style should be taken as a permanent warning and lesson for you.
    It should also be pointed out that you have made great ideological changes under the criticism and assistance of the Ministry. After the working group headed by Vice Managers Lu Zongxian and Wu Shijie went to the plant, they were able to first report the company's leadership review to the plant's employees and absorb the criticisms of the comrades below. You did well in this regard. This first improved the abnormal relationship between the upper and lower levels. Subsequently, Vice Managers Lu Zongxian and Wu Shijie, as well as the engineering personnel sent by the company, went to the workers and technicians to jointly study improvement methods, and quickly solved a number of urgent problems. You also did well in this regard. Believing in the workers and relying on the masses of workers to jointly solve difficulties resulted in tremendous power. Subsequently, various systems and labor disciplines were established during this period. With the support of the workers, sabotage elements were purged, and the factory gradually established a normal management order. In addition, you cooperated with the plant's CCP branch and trade union to conduct studies on unity and cooperation between party members and non-party members, and on the relationship between superiors and subordinates, thereby promoting further unity among all the plant's employees and between superiors and subordinates, overcoming difficulties, and improving production. This series of practices, except for some that still need to be studied, we believe is basically correct.
    The transformation of the Liulihe Cement Plant this time is inseparable from the transformation of your company's leadership. In addition to the major gains in production (this is the purpose), you must learn from the experience to improve your leadership and ideological level, not be arrogant or complacent, and better improve and promote all production work. The Ministry awaits your new work achievements.

　　重工业部指示华北窑业公司
    警惕官僚主义作风  记取教训再求改进
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部于六月十三日向华北窑业公司发出指示，全文如下：
    琉璃河水泥厂五月份生产成绩超过了一九四四年自日寇、国民党及解放以来最高纪录，水泥生产超过计划百分之二十八点五，熟料超过计划百分之十八，职工空前团结，克服了层层困难，生产情绪高涨，证明了你们自三月底组织工作组下厂工作，结合该厂全厂职工努力，因而获得了上列的成就。
    应当指出，过去公司在领导上，是存在严重的官僚主义作风：缺乏自我批评，强调机器老（老也是事实），缺乏深入下层，发动群众，依靠工人阶级，克服困难，改进生产的信心。因此在接管后，很长时期工厂生产改进不大，特别在去年底及今年一月间，工厂造成严重局面，水泥生产只完成计划百分之八·二八，熟料百分之五六·八，机器发生严重故障（一、二月份大小故障即有三十余次之多）。在局面严重之后，公司对厂的工作，仍是老一套的翻来覆去的文牍领导；对本部做报告时，内部真实情况（如干部严重不团结现象）很少提到；生产任务不能完成，不从领导上和你们工作上检讨，只强调机器老，计划订大了等一套理由。这种对内部真实情况不能反映的官样文章报告，直到本部一再指出须另作综合报告，并派人检查后，才引起你们的注意。应当指出，这一套官僚主义作风，应引为你们永远的警惕与教训。
    也应该指出，你们在本部的批评与帮助之下，曾做了很大的思想上的转变。以陆宗贤、吴士杰两副理为首的工作组下厂后，能对厂的职工首先报告公司领导上的检讨，并吸取下面同志的批评。这点你们做得好。这首先使过去上下之间不正常的关系开始好转。继之，陆宗贤、吴士杰两副经理及公司派去之工程人员，到工人中去与工人、技术人员共同研究改进办法，并迅速解决了若干急待解决的问题。这一点你们也做得好。相信工人，依靠工人群众共同解决困难，因而发生巨大力量。随后，在此期间建立了各种制度，及劳动纪律，在工人拥护之下，清洗了破坏分子，逐步使工厂建立起正常管理秩序。此外，你们配合该厂中共支部及工会，进行党与非党人士团结合作及上下级关系的学习，因而促进全厂职工间、上下级间进一步团结起来，克服困难，改进了生产。这一系列的做法，除了某些还值得研究外，我们认为基本上是正确的。
    此次琉璃河水泥厂转变与你们公司领导上的转变是分不开的，除在生产上得到重大收获外（这是目的），在你们本身要很好地吸取其中经验，提高领导思想水平，不骄不懈，将全部生产工作更好地提高与推动起来。本部等待你们新的工作成就。
