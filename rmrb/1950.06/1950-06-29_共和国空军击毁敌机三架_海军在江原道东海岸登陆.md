　　The Republic's Air Force conducted seven bombing and strafing runs on enemy positions and fortifications south of the 38th parallel on the 25th and 26th. A fighter squadron of the Air Force attacked airfields in Yeongdeungpo (southwest of Seoul) and Gimpo (northwest of Seoul) on the 25th, destroying three enemy planes and burning hangars and oil depots. Another Air Force unit attacked the Seoul area on the 26th, destroying enemy military trains and military buildings. Another Air Force squadron strafed many military vehicles at Susaek Station and Namsan Station on the Han (Seoul)-Uiju railway line on the 26th, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.
　　After landing in Gangneung, Samcheok and other places on the east coast of Gangwon Province south of the 38th parallel, the Republic's naval forces have joined forces with the local people's guerrillas, liberated the nearby areas, and are now advancing towards Uljin County in Gangwon Province and Bonghwa County in Gyeongsangbuk-do.
　　Due to the heroic advance of the People's Army, the Syngman Rhee puppet government has fled in panic from Seoul towards Daejeon (South Chungcheong Province).
　　In the aforementioned battles, the People's Army annihilated and captured more than 6,000 enemy troops and seized a large number of weapons. Detailed results are being tallied.

　　共和国空军击毁敌机三架  海军在江原道东海岸登陆
    共和国的空军在二十五、二十六两天中，对三八线以南的敌军阵地与工事进行轰炸与扫射共达七次。空军某区分队的战斗机于二十五日袭击永登浦（汉城西南）与金浦（汉城西北）的飞机场，击毁敌机三架，焚毁了机库和油库。另部空军于二十六日袭击汉城地区，炸毁敌军用列车及军事建筑物等。空军另一区分队于二十六日对汉（城）义（新义州）铁路线上水色站和南山站的许多军车施以扫射，予敌重创。
    共和国海军部队在三八线以南江原道东海岸的江陵、三陟等地登陆后，已与该地区的人民游击队会师，解放了附近地区，现正向江原道的蔚珍县和庆尚北道的奉化县进击。
    由于人民军的英勇进军，李承晚傀儡政府已仓皇地自汉城向大田（忠清南道）方面逃跑。
    人民军在上述各战役中共计歼俘敌军六千余名，缴获武器甚多。详细战果在清查中。
