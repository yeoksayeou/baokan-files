　　Huai'an Shiqiao District Land Reform Results in High Farmer Production Enthusiasm, Confident of a 10% Increase in Production
　　[Shanghai News] *Jiefang Daily* News: In Shiqiao District, Huai'an County, Northern Jiangsu, after land reform and the establishment of property rights, the emancipated farmers' production enthusiasm has greatly increased. They are universally intensifying fertilization during spring planting and hoeing, adding agricultural tools and livestock, and actively striving to complete the 1950 agricultural production plan to increase production by 10%.
　　In the past, the vast majority of land in this district was occupied by landlords. For example, in the thirteen villages of Jianhe South, over 90% of farmers completely rented land from landlords.
　　Land reform work was implemented in 1946, and the completion of land reform, establishment of property rights, and issuance of land licenses began last winter. As a result, the farmers' production enthusiasm has been greatly encouraged. At the same time, due to the promotion of "Hard Work Builds a Family, Production Leads to Prosperity," the farmers' labor enthusiasm has been further enhanced.
　　In the nearly half-year since the end of land reform, farmers have been diligently working in their own fields during the spring planting and hoeing campaign. For example, in the district's more than 69,900 mu of spring-planted fields, farmers have generally been able to intensify fertilization. Currently, over 55,900 mu, accounting for 80% of the total acreage, have been hoed three times and planted with beans, and 10% of the fields have been hoed four times. A small number of fields, due to delayed planting and replanting, have currently been hoed twice.
　　In terms of fertilization, it not only exceeds previous years but also exceeds the general requirements of the production increase plan. In previous years, rice and wheat fields averaged about 20 dan of manure per mu. Dry land averaged eight or nine small carts. This year's production increase plan requires 22 dan per mu for rice and wheat fields and 12 or 13 small carts per mu for dry land. In reality, the district's rice and wheat fields have been fertilized with over 23 dan per mu, with a large portion of the fields fertilized with 35 to 50 dan of manure per mu. Every day, groups of people go to Huai'an City before dawn to carry manure home; at noon, the manure carriers on the roads east and south of Huai'an City are even more numerous.
　　Regarding the addition of agricultural tools: the original plan was to add 762 iron shovels and 426 iron spades. Currently, 1,540 iron shovels and 303 iron spades have been added and completed. Additionally, 102 plows and harrows have been added. 218 ox carts have been completed, exceeding the original plan by ten carts. 287 head of cattle have been bred and purchased, exceeding the original plan by 37 head. Furthermore, 294 donkeys, 13 mules, and 10 horses have been purchased. The task of raising 3,710 pigs has been 934 pigs accomplished.
　　Based on the existing achievements and the current situation, there is complete confidence in achieving the plan to increase production by 10%, provided there are no other disasters.

### 淮安石塘区土地改革后  农民生产情绪高  增产一成有把握

　　淮安石塘区土地改革后
    农民生产情绪高  增产一成有把握
    【上海讯】解放日报消息：经过土改并确立产权后的苏北淮安县石塘区，翻身农民生产情绪大为提高，春种春锄中普遍加工施肥，增添农具、牲畜，积极努力争取完成一九五○年增产一成的农业生产计划。
    该区土地过去绝大部分为地主占有。如涧河南十三个乡有百分之九十以上农民，完全租种地主土地。
    一九四六年实行土地改革工作，去年冬天又开始结束土改，确立产权，发放土地执照。因此农民的生产情绪受到很大鼓舞。同时由于宣传了“劳动兴家、生产致富”，农民的劳动情绪更加提高。
    在结束土改的近半年来，在春种春锄运动中，农民普遍在自己的田地上辛勤操作。如全区六万九千九百余亩春种稖头田，农民一般都做到了加工施肥。目前锄好三遍并点种豆子的即有五万五千九百余亩，占总亩数百分之八十，并有百分之十的田亩已锄完四遍。有少数田地由于缺种迟种和补种的，目前也锄过了两遍。
    施肥方面不但超过往年，且超过增产计划中的一般要求。往年稻麦田每亩平均约二十担粪。旱田平均八、九小车，今年增产计划中要求稻麦田每亩二十二担，旱田每亩十二、三小车。而全区稻麦田每亩实际施肥到二十三担以上，其中并有大部分田地每亩施肥到三十五担至五十担粪。每天天不亮就有成群结队的人到淮安城内挑粪回家；中午时淮安城东边、南边大路上的粪担子更是络绎不绝。
    增添农具方面：原布置增添铁锹七百六十二把，铁锨四百二十六把，现已增添和完成铁锹一千五百四十把，铁锨三百零三把。另并增添犁耙一百零二张。牛车完成二百一十八辆，超过原计划十辆。繁殖和添购耕牛二百八十七头，超过原计划三十七头。另还添购驴子二百九十四条，骡子十三条，马十匹。养猪三千七百一十只的任务已完成九百三十四只。
    根据现有成绩和目前情况，如无其他灾害，实现增产一成的计划有完全把握。
