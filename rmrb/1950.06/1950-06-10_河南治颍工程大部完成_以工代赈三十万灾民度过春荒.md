Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 8th: The project to dredge the Yi River in Henan Province began in March and April of this year, and now more than 85% of the entire project has been completed. The entire project can be completed before the summer flood season. Upon completion, 180,000 mu of farmland on both banks of the lower reaches of the river will be protected from flooding. 180,000 civilian laborers from ten counties in the Huaiyang, Xuchang, and Xinyang special districts, and 13,000 military laborers from a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army participated in this river excavation project. The Central People's Government and the Henan Provincial People's Government allocated a total of 26,710,000 catties of work grain, and implemented the policy of using work as relief, thereby enabling 300,000 disaster victims in the river area to overcome the spring famine. The Yi River is a relatively large river that runs diagonally through more than ten counties in central Henan. Since the Kuomintang destroyed the Yellow River embankment in 1938, causing a major flood, the river channel has been silted up and has been prone to flooding over the years. This construction adopts a method that combines both short-term and long-term solutions. First, the most vulnerable section of the lower reaches of the river from Liwan in Xihua County to Sunzukou is being renovated. This section is about 72 li long, and the project includes the construction of river embankments and the widening and deepening of the river channel; among them, a 22 li section of the river channel is being straightened. The entire project requires a total of 6,349,000 cubic meters of earthwork. During the project, the commissioners of the Huaiyang and Xuchang special districts and the county heads of various counties personally went to the construction site to supervise and guide, and many district and township cadres carried soil and mud with the civilian laborers, which greatly encouraged the morale of the civilian laborers.

　　河南治颍工程大部完成
    以工代赈三十万灾民度过春荒
    【新华社开封八日电】河南省疏浚颍河的工程，于今年三、四月间开始，现已完成全部工程的百分之八十五以上。全部工程可于夏汛前完成。完成后，可使该河下游两岸的十八万亩的田地免除水患。参加此项挖河工程的有淮阳、许昌、信阳三专区十个县民工，和第四野战军某部一万三千军工，共十八万人。中央人民政府及河南省人民政府共拨出工粮二千六百七十一万斤，实行以工代赈，沿河灾区三十万灾民因此度过春荒。颍河是斜贯河南中部十余县的较大河流，自一九三八年国民党掘毁黄河堤岸造成大泛以来，该河河道淤塞，历年泛滥成灾。这次施工采取治标与治本兼顾办法，首先修整该河下游西华县李湾至孙咀口的最易溃决的一段。这一段长约七十二华里，工程包括修筑河堤及将河道开宽浚深；其中尚有二十二华里的一段河道是改道取直。全部工程共需六百三十四万九千公方的土工。工程进行期中，淮阳、许昌两专区的专员及各县县长均亲到工地督促指导，许多区乡干部与民工一起担土、捞泥，大大鼓励了民工的挖河情绪。
