　　Cultural Learning in Northeast Military Region Units Over the Past Five Months
    Existing Achievements: An average of over 300 characters learned per person in five months.
    Yu Wenqi, Li Zhengzhong
    Since the Northeast Military Region's Propaganda and Education Work Conference last November, cultural learning has been universally launched in units under the Northeast Military Region, achieving great results. According to statistics from the spring general examination of four divisions, each person learned an average of 375 new characters in five months. A certain division with faster progress learned an average of 450 new characters per person; a certain regiment's infantry-artillery company of a certain division learned an average of 600 characters per person. Moreover, they have generally achieved the ability to read, write, speak, and use the characters. According to statistics from two other divisions, after three months of cultural education in the first quarter of this year, the percentage of officers and soldiers who knew fewer than 200 characters decreased from 43.5% to 18.3%; the percentage who knew more than 400 characters increased from 33.3% to 53.6%; and the percentage who knew more than 1,000 characters increased from 12.8% to 21.8%. These figures are representative of the general progress. In a certain division with faster progress, those who knew more than 1,000 characters had reached one-quarter of the total number of people in the division. Judging from the above achievements, the Northeast Military Region's requirement of each person learning 800 to 1,000 characters within one year can be achieved.

    Learning Goals: Learn 1,500 characters and master integer arithmetic within two years.

    The members of the Northeast troops are mostly liberated peasants with low levels of education. Soldiers with an educational level below junior primary school account for 87% of the total number of people. When military training began in June and July of last year, four divisions conducted cultural education, stipulating that Chinese language should be the main subject, with five hours per week. Although the soldiers' enthusiasm for learning was quite high, the results of the first stage were not significant because leaders at all levels did not pay enough attention, various systems were not earnestly implemented, teaching materials were not uniformly resolved, and there were few cultural teachers with weak skills. At the Military Region's Propaganda and Education Work Conference last November, the previous period of cultural and educational work was discussed and summarized, and the future cultural education policy was clearly defined. Subsequently, at the Military Region's training conference, Commander Gao Gang proposed the requirement of learning 1,500 to 2,000 characters and mastering integer arithmetic within two years. The Political Department of the Northeast Military Region uniformly compiled and printed various teaching materials for Chinese language and arithmetic; stipulated that cultural classes should be increased from five to twelve hours per week, with two cultural teachers in each company, and that the military region, divisions, and regiments should respectively stipulate the educational progress for each quarter, month, and week. Later, the military region successively promulgated regulations on cultural and educational work, classroom rules, and a periodic examination system. At the same time, it was determined that each Communist Party Committee of the regiment should appoint a dedicated person to be responsible for the cultural and educational work of the entire regiment, and the regiment propaganda section chief should preside over a "education preparation meeting" once a week. In January of this year, the military region convened a cultural and educational symposium attended by more than 20 cultural teachers from various divisions to broadly exchange teaching experiences and solve some problems existing in teaching methods and mutual aid movements. By putting forward clear policies and requirements at the leadership level, earnestly implementing various systems, and continuously conducting in-depth inspections and specific guidance, cultural education in the troops was able to unfold smoothly.

    Learning Status: Learning is conducted anytime, anywhere, and attention is paid to immediate application of what is learned.

    All soldiers have extremely high enthusiasm for learning culture. Especially after learning hundreds of characters, they can initially apply them to reading newspapers, looking at letters, and writing articles, and they have become even more aware of the benefits of cultural learning, and can use all spare time to review their lessons. Some soldiers even draw characters on their stomachs with their fingers when they go to bed. In production, many soldiers put down their plows and pick up textbooks to read, or practice writing on the ground while pulling up sorghum stubble; many places have used flexible learning methods such as "literacy cards" and "story bags." Soldiers have generally saved their allowances to buy fountain pens. According to statistics from a certain division directly under the military region at the end of March, on average, each person had a fountain pen. The entire army is filled with confidence in cultural learning.

    Teaching Experience: Less lecturing and more practice, carrying out mass mutual aid movement, strengthening pre-class preparation, and enriching lesson plans.

    In terms of teaching methods, some preliminary experiences have also been gained over the past five months. The first is to implement the principle of less lecturing and more practice in teaching. Because the education objects in the troops are all adults with strong thinking abilities, they can understand after the teacher explains it briefly and concisely once. However, adults have poor memory, so repeated practice must be emphasized. In practice, combine more with practical applications so that they can master language rules and various algorithms from practice. More practice does not only refer to practice in the classroom, but also more homework should be done, homework assignments should be issued regularly, and teachers should pay attention to correcting the homework. Classroom practice should generally account for one-half of the teaching time, and homework should be done more than once a week. The second is to carry out a mass learning mutual aid movement, forming mutual aid groups of three or five people in the same study group within the administrative class. Teachers take charge of mutual aid exercises in the classroom, and group leaders lead the preview of texts, research and discuss various difficult problems, and conduct mutual testing and questioning at any time, so that the acquired achievements can be reviewed and consolidated, and the integration of learning and application can be achieved. Finally, strengthening teachers' pre-class preparation, especially the preparation of lesson plans, has the greatest impact on the effectiveness of the class. The lesson plan should include the central content of the text, the specific methods and steps of lecturing, as well as the time allocation, practice content, and methods. With a lesson plan, the lecture can have a center and a system, and the time and progress can be controlled. In order to improve lesson plans and improve teachers' business, various troops have implemented a method of collective evaluation of lesson plans based on the regiment.

　　东北军区各部队五个月来的文化学习
    已有的成绩：五个月中平均每人学了三百多字。
    于文启　李正中
    东北军区所属各部队，自去年十一月军区宣教工作会议后，普遍展开了文化学习，获得了很大成绩。据四个师的春季大测验后的统计，五个月中每人平均学了三七五个生字，进步较快的某师每人平均识四五○个生字；某师某团步炮连每人平均识了六百字。而且普遍做到了会念、会写、会讲、会用。又据另两个师的统计，经过今年第一季度三个月的文化教育，全体指战员中，识二百字以下的由百分之四三点五减至百分之一八点三；识四百字以上的由百分之三三点三增至百分之五三点六；识千字以上的由百分之一二点八增至百分之二一点八。这个数字可代表一般的进步情况。进步较快的某师，识千字以上的已达到全师总人数的四分之一。从以上成绩来看，一年之内可以达到东北军区提出的每人识八百到一千字的要求。
    学习目标：两年内学会一千五百字，算会整数四则。
    东北部队的成员绝大部分是翻身农民，文化程度低，战士中文化程度在初小以下的占总人数百分之八十七。去年六、七月间军事练兵开始时，即有四个师进行了文化教育，当时规定以国文为主，每周五小时。战士们的学习情绪虽相当高，但由于各级领导重视不够，各种制度没有认真贯彻执行，教材没有统一解决，文化教员量少质弱，因此第一阶段收效不大。去年十一月军区宣教工作会议上，讨论和总结了前一时期的文教工作，明确规定了今后文化教育方针。接着在军区练兵会议上，高岗司令员又提出两年内学会一千五百字到两千字，算术学会整数四则的要求。东北军区政治部统一编印了国文、算术各种教材；规定文化课由每周五小时增至十二小时，每连设两名文化教员，由军区、师、团分别规定每季度、每月、每周的教育进度。以后军区又连续颁布了文教工作条例，课堂规则和定期考试制度等。同时，确定各中共团党委指定专人负责全团文教工作，和团宣传股长主持每周召开一次“教育准备会”。今年一月，军区又召集有各师二十余名文化教员参加的文教座谈会，广泛交流教学经验，解决了教学法上及互助运动当中存在着的若干问题。从领导上提出了明确的方针与要求，认真执行各种制度，并不断进行深入检查和具体指导，这样就使得部队文化教育顺利展开。
    学习现状：随时随地进行学习，学了立即注意应用。
    全体战士学习文化的热情极高。特别是在学会了几百个字以后，能够初步应用到读报，看信，写稿上去，就更加体会到了文化学习的好处，能利用一切空隙时间来复习功课。有的战士睡到床上还用手指在肚子上划字。在生产当中，很多战士放下犁杖就拿起课本来念，或拔高粱槎子在地上练写；许多地方利用了“识字牌”、“盛话袋”等灵活的学习方法。战士们普遍地把津贴积存起来买自来水钢笔，如军区直属某师据三月底的统计，平均每人有一支自来水钢笔。全军在文化学习中，充满了前进的信心。
    教学经验：少讲多练，开展群众性互助运动，加强课前准备、充实教案。
    在教学方法上，五个月来也取得了几点初步经验。首先就是在教学中贯彻少讲多练的原则。因为部队教育对象都是成年人，思考力较强，只要教员简明扼要地讲解一遍，就能懂得。但成年人的记忆力较差，所以必须强调反复练习。在练习中多结合实际应用，使其从练习中来掌握语文规律和各种演算法则。多练习不单是指课堂上的练习，还要多搞课外作业，定期发给作业题，教员应注意作业的修改。课堂练习一般应占教学时间的二分之一，作业每周要在一次以上。其次是开展群众性的学习互助运动，在行政班内以同一学习组的三人或五人组成互助小组，在课堂上由教员掌握进行互助练习，课外由小组长领导预习课文，研究和讨论各种疑难问题，并随时进行互测互问，这样，可以复习和巩固既得的成绩，并使学与用能趋一致。最后就是加强教员的课前准备，特别是教案的准备，对上课的收效影响最大。教案要包括课文的中心内容、讲课的具体方法和步骤，以及时间分配、练习内容和方法等。讲课有了教案就能有中心，有系统，也能掌握时间和进度。为了改进教案和提高教员业务各部队曾实行以团为单位集体评教案的方法。
