　　Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch—About five thousand children representatives from the capital gathered at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall today to celebrate the first International Children's Day. Young friends and mothers from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, Korea, Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslovakia were also invited to attend. The national flag of our country, as well as the Young Pioneers team flag and red scarves, fluttered in the sun, painting the venue a sea of red.
　　The assembly first passed a motion to name the people's leader Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu, and the great leader of the world's working people, Stalin, as honorary chairmen of the assembly. The presidium included more than twenty children from Beijing, one child from the Soviet Union, two children from Korea, and over a dozen leaders and leaders of people's organizations. The executive chairman of the assembly—twelve-year-old Young Pioneer Cai Xiang—said in his opening speech: Because of the care and cultivation of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the children of China are able to happily celebrate their own festival today. He called on the children to take practical action, following Chairman Mao's words to "study hard," to strive to realize Chairman Mao's great ideals, and to fight for world peace.
