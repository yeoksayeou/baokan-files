　　Railway Workers' Cultural Troupe Expands Organization
    Completes Performances Along Jinghan and Jingshan Railways, Moves to Stations and Sections Along Jinpu and Other Lines
    [Reported by this newspaper] The experimental "Cultural Work Team" organized by the Cultural and Educational Department of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Union in early May, returned to Beijing on the 8th of this month after working for a month in various stations, sections, and factories of the Tianjin Railway Bureau. It initially summarized its work and expanded its organization. It has now departed on the 14th to continue performing for workers in various stations and sections under the Jinan Railway Bureau. The team is a joint effort of the Railway Union's film team, the Tianjin Railway Bureau's band, and the "New Folk Art Experimental Mobile Group" of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Folk Art Improvement Association. It departed from Beijing on the 8th of last month, and successively performed new folk arts and screened films for railway employees in Guye, Tangshan, Cangxian, Botouzhen, Dexian, Baotou, Guihua, Datong, Zhangjiakou, Nankou, and other places. It held 27 fixed performances, with a total audience of over 80,000 people, averaging over 3,000 people per performance. In addition, it also gave many temporary performances in carriages, stations, waiting rooms, and other places.

    In addition to congratulating and expressing sympathy for the rationalization proposals, new record movement, and model worker movement that are being carried out by railway employees in various places, the team also organized cultural and recreational cadres on the spot to assist the trade union branches of the railway to carry out cultural and recreational activities for employees. At the same time, the artists went deep into the front line to experience the lives of workers, learned from workers, and collected typical materials at any time to create experience to improve their work. In addition, they also paid attention to uniting local old artists and assisting them in carrying out new literary and art activities serving workers and peasants. They held several joint symposiums and parties with local artists, exchanged experiences, and exchanged opinions, which played a certain educational and transformative role for the general old artists. In Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and other places, they also used the local radio station during their daytime spare time to broadcast new folk art, drum lyrics, and other content to the general public.

    The programs they performed in the past month have been widely welcomed by the workers and masses in various places. The workers unanimously hoped that such a cultural work team would come to perform for them regularly. Especially in smaller railway stations, because there are usually few cultural and recreational activities, the performance of this cultural work team was even more cherished. Workers in many areas repeatedly urged them to stay longer and hoped that they would "come often" in the future. Before leaving, some units gave them banners, and many workers collectively signed their names to give them as souvenirs.

    Due to the good results of their performance this time, railway unions in many areas have paid more attention to workers' cultural and recreational activities. Railway employees in Botouzhen, Cangxian, and other places have begun to organize local cultural and artistic talents and prepare to carry out regular cultural and recreational work.

    During this performance, railway employees in some places reflected that the content of the team's performance was not diverse enough. For this reason, the team expanded its organization. In addition to the personnel from the original three units, the Shijiazhuang City Literary and Art Work Troupe also joined the team, preparing to perform the comedy "Not a Cicada" created by Wei Lianzhen, a worker at the Shijiazhuang Vehicle Inspection Section, for railway employees in various places. They also prepared some small operas to make the content of future performances more abundant and vivid. The team has now departed from Beijing for the second time on the 14th and will go to various stations, sections, and factories under the Jinan Railway Bureau and Shanghai Railway Bureau for activities, scheduled to work for two months.

    The Cultural and Educational Department of the National Committee of the Railway Union also plans to publish a "Railway Workers' Club" publication to exchange the creative experiences of workers in various places, enrich the content of cultural and recreational activities, and promote the literary and art work of railway workers in various places.

　　铁路工会文工队扩大组织
    沿京山京汉两路演唱完毕  转赴津浦等线各站段活动
    【本报讯】中国铁路工会全国委员会文教部在五月初组成的实验性的“文艺工作队”，在天津铁路局各站、段、厂工作了一个月以后，于本月八日返抵北京，初步总结了工作，并扩大了组织。现已于十四日出发赴济南铁路局所属各站段继续为工人演出。该队是由铁路工会的电影队、天津铁路局的乐队和中国曲艺改进协会筹委会的“新曲艺实验流动小组”联合组成的。于上月八日由北京出发，先后在古冶、唐山、沧县、泊头镇、德县、包头、归绥、大同、张家口、南口等地为铁路职工演唱新曲艺和放映电影。前后举行了固定性的演出二十七次，观众共达八万余人，平均每次观众都在三千人以上。此外，还在车厢、车站、候车室等处作了许多临时性的演唱。
    该队除为各地铁路职工正在开展的合理化建议、新纪录运动、英模运动等表示庆贺与慰问外，并就地组织文娱干部，协助铁路工会各分会的职工开展文化娱乐活动。同时，艺人们并深入现场体验工人生活，向工人学习，随时收集典型材料，创造经验，以改进自己的工作。此外，他们还注意团结当地的旧艺人，协助当地艺人们开展为工农服务的新文艺活动。他们曾与各地艺人举行过多次的联合座谈会与联欢晚会，彼此交流经验，交换意见，对一般的旧艺人起了一定的教育与改造作用。在唐山、张家口等地，他们还利用白天的空暇，借用当地电台，向广大群众播送了新的曲艺、鼓词等。
    一个月来他们所演出的节目，普遍地受到各地工人群众的热烈欢迎，工人们一致地希望经常有这样的文艺工作队来为他们演出。特别是在各较小的路站，因为平常很少有文娱活动，对这次文艺工作队的演出更为珍视。许多地区的工人一再挽留他们多停留一些时候，并希望他们以后“常常来”。临别时，有的单位并送给他们锦旗，许多工人集体签名送给他们作纪念。
    由于他们此次演出的良好效果，不少地区的铁路工会更为注意工人的文化娱乐活动。泊头镇、沧县等地的铁路职工，已着手组织当地文艺工作人材，准备开展经常性的文娱工作。
    在此次演出中，有的地方的铁路职工反映该队演出的内容还不够多样化。该队为此又扩大了组织，除原有三单位的人员外，石家庄市文艺工作团亦参加了该队，准备为各地铁路职工演出石家庄检车段工人魏连珍创作的喜剧“不是蝉”，并准备了一些小型歌剧，使今后演出的内容更为丰富生动。现该队已于十四日第二次离京出发，将往济南铁路局、上海铁路局所属各站、段、厂活动，预定工作两个月。
    铁路工会全国委员会文教部并拟出版“铁路工人俱乐部”刊物一种，以交流各地工人的创作经验，丰富文娱活动的内容，以推动各地铁路工人的文艺工作。
