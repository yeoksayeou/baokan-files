Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, stated:
America's Reckless Actions are a Sign of Weakness

[This newspaper's dispatch] Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, issued a statement on the 29th, opposing imperialist provocations and supporting Premier Zhou's statement, saying:

    President Truman's statement on June 27th completely exposed the aggressive face of imperialist bandits. Using the situation in Korea as a pretext, American imperialism outrageously claimed that it would use its navy to control Taiwan. This not only violates the Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, and the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, regarding the urging of Japan's surrender, but also contradicts itself, violating Truman's own statement on January 5, 1950, regarding the Taiwan issue. Such blatant acts of aggression by American imperialism will only arouse deeper anger and resolute resistance from the Chinese and even the Asian people. We Chinese people have long recognized that American imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger. America's reckless actions only indicate the weakness of American imperialism, not its strength. We resolutely support Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of the 28th and oppose the unreasonable provocations of American imperialist bandits. We pledge to unite as one, with one heart and one mind, and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan from the hands of American imperialist aggressors. We believe that victory will surely belong to the Chinese people.

　　民进主席马叙伦谈话称：
    美帝胡作妄为正是弱的表现
    【本报讯】中国民主促进会主席马叙伦二十九日发表谈话，反对帝国主义的挑衅，拥护周外长的声明称：
    美国杜鲁门总统六月二十七日的声明，完全暴露了帝国主义强盗侵略的面目。美帝国主义以朝鲜形势为借口，竟然妄称要以海军控制台湾。这不但违反了一九四三年十二月一日的开罗宣言，违反了一九四五年七月二十六日关于促令日本投降的波茨坦公告，同时也打了他自己的嘴巴，违反了杜鲁门自己在一九五○年一月五日关于台湾问题的声明。美帝国主义这样明目张胆的侵略行为，只有引起我中国乃至亚洲人民更深的愤怒和坚决的反抗。我们中国人民早已认识美帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎。美帝这样的胡作妄为，只是表示美帝国主义的弱，而不是表示美帝的强。我们坚决拥护周恩来部长二十八日的声明，反对美帝国主义强盗的无理挑衅。我们誓必团结一致，万众一心，为从美帝国主义侵略者手中解放台湾而奋斗到底。我们相信，胜利是一定属于中国人民的。
