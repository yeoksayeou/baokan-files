Xinhua News Agency, June 9th, Dispatch from Tokyo via TASS, June 9th: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, "Akahata," published a statement on June 8th from the Central Supervisory Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. The statement pointed out: "Due to MacArthur's directive, the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party has been virtually forced to cease its activities. In the current emergency situation, in order to adapt to the revolutionary high tide of the masses and to carry out the major tasks facing the Party, the Supervisory Committee elected by the Party's Sixth Congress believes it is necessary to establish a provisional central leadership body to exercise its powers until the Party's future congress is convened."

The following comrades have been appointed to organize the Provisional Central Leadership of the Japanese Communist Party: Etsuro Shiino (Chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Japanese Communist Party), Ichizo Luneta (Supervisory Committee Member), Fumio Sugimoto (Chairman of the Communist Party's Tokyo District Committee), Ryuji Tada (Chairman of the Communist Party's Kansai District Committee), Ichizo Suzuki (Former Vice Chairman of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union), Katsumi Totoki, Kenji Kawada, and Zentarō Taniguchi (the above three are all members of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet).

Xinhua News Agency, June 9th: According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch: Members of the Japanese Communist Party in the Diet issued a joint statement on June 8th, stating that they are determined to fight to the end against the Yoshida government's attempt to outlaw the Communist Party through legislation. The statement declared that the JCP Diet members are prepared for the Yoshida Cabinet's conspiracy in the upcoming special session of the Diet; and guaranteed that they would "exert their utmost efforts to smash all the policies of the Yoshida Cabinet, which are turning Japan into a colony and a military base in preparation for launching a war." The statement concluded that in the struggle against the Yoshida Cabinet's conspiracy, the Communist Party will not hesitate to fight alongside the people.

The statement announced that they have appointed Karoku Hosokawa, who was re-elected as a member of the House of Councillors on the 4th, as the leader of the JCP Diet members group, replacing Sanzō Nosaka, who was illegally "purged" on the 6th.

    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社九日电引东京消息：日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》于八日发表日本共产党中央监察委员会的声明。该声明指出：由于麦克阿瑟的指令，“日本共产党中央委员会实际上已被迫停止活动。在现已发生的紧急局势之下，为适应群众的革命高潮，并为执行党所面临的重大任务起见，由党的第六次代表大会选出的监察委员会，认为必须成立一个临时中央领导机关，在党的未来代表大会召开之前，行使职权”。
    下列诸同志受命组织日本共产党临时中央领导机关：椎野悦郎（日本共产党中央监察委员会主席），轮田一造（监察委员），杉本文雄（共产党东京区委员会主席），多田留治（共产党关西区委员会主席），铃木市藏（前日本国营铁道工人工会副主席），听涛克己，河田贤治以及谷口善太郎（以上三人均为日本国会众院议员）。
    【新华社九日讯】据路透社东京讯：日本共产党的国会议员们于八日发表联合声明称：他们对于吉田政府用立法手段来宣布共产党为非法的企图，誓将进行贯彻到底的斗争。声明宣称：日共议员对吉田内阁在即将到来的国会特别会议中的阴谋，已有准备；并保证他们要“竭尽最大的努力来粉碎吉田内阁的一切政策，这些政策正在使日本变成殖民地和军事基地，以准备发动战争”。声明结语称：在反抗吉田内阁的阴谋的斗争中，共产党并将毫不犹豫地和人民在一起进行斗争。
    声明宣布他们已推任四日重新当选参议员的细川嘉六为日共国会议员团的领袖，以代替六日被非法“整肃”的野坂参三。
