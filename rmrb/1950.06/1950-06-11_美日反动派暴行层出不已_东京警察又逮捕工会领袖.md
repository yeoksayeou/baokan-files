Xinhua News Agency, 10th. U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, while intensifying their suppression of the Japanese Communist Party, are also brutally arresting leaders of progressive Japanese labor unions. According to Tokyo dispatches from the Associated Press and Reuters: Tokyo police arrested Sato Yasumasa, chairman of the National Council of Government and Public Workers' Unions, and Secretary Nakagawa on the 8th, on the "charge" that they were "related to the open letter to MacArthur by thirty labor unions on June 3." Prior to this, Tokyo police illegally arrested Nakahara Junkichi, one of the leaders of the All-Japan Metalworkers' Union, and Shindo Shigeo, secretary of the All-Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union, on the 6th. Nakahara's arrest was because he had read out the aforementioned open letter to MacArthur at the "General Mobilization Assembly to Break Through the Industrial Crisis" organized by the All-Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union on the 3rd. Shindo's arrest was because of so-called "suspicions of holding demonstrations, violating city regulations, and violating laws prohibiting acts harmful to the occupation forces."

The Yoshida government's brutal act of illegally arresting labor union leaders has aroused strike protests from automobile workers. According to Kyodo News, at the call of the All-Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union, workers at four factories of Nissan Motor Company went on strike for one hour on the 8th to protest the authorities' ban on assemblies and demonstrations, and to demand the release of the illegally arrested labor union leaders.

　　美日反动派暴行层出不已  东京警察又逮捕工会领袖
    【新华社十日讯】美、日反动派在与加紧镇压日本共产党同时，横暴地逮捕日本进步工会领袖。据美联社、路透社东京消息：东京警察于八日逮捕全国官厅职工工会协议会主席佐藤安政及书记中川两人，“罪名”是他们“与三十个工会在六月三日致麦克阿瑟的公开信有关”。在此以前，东京警察曾于六日非法逮捕了全日金属工人工会的负责人之一中原淳吉，及全日汽车产业工人工会书记进藤重男。中原的被捕是因为他于三日在全日汽车产业工人工会主办的“突破产业危机总奋起大会”上，曾宣读上述的致麦克阿瑟的公开信。进藤的被捕是因为有所谓“举行示威，违犯城市条规以及违犯禁止作有害于占领军行动的法令的嫌疑”。
    吉田政府非法逮捕工会领袖的暴行，已引起汽车工人的罢工抗议。据共同社消息，在全日汽车产业工人工会的号召下，日产汽车公司的四个工厂的工人，在八日罢工一小时，抗议当局禁止集会游行，并要求释放被非法逮捕的工会领袖。
