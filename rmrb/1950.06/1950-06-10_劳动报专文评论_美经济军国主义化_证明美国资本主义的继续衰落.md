    U.S. Economic Militarization
    Proves Continued Decline of American Capitalism
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 9th] TASS Moscow, June 7th: Chebrakov recently published a special article in Labor Daily entitled "The Militarization of the American Economy," stating that since the Second World War, the American economy has been accelerating its militarization and is adjusting to conform to the heinous plans of the aggressors. An increasing amount of production capacity, labor, and raw materials are being used to manufacture military supplies. American financial magazines openly admit that the government's military programs mean subsidies for industry. The militarization of the American economy proves the continued decline of American capitalism and means that the contradictions that are now disintegrating the capitalist system are being further deepened.

    美经济军国主义化
    证明美国资本主义的继续衰落
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：切布拉科夫顷以《美国经济之军国主义化》为题在劳动报发表专文称：第二次世界大战以后，美国经济正在加紧军国主义化，并且正在调整以符合侵略者的罪恶计划。日益加多的生产能力、劳动力和原料，正在用来制造军用物资。美国各金融杂志公然承认，政府的军备计划就是意味着给工业以津贴。美国经济的军国主义化，证明了美国资本主义的继续衰落，并且意味着现在正在使资本主义制度分崩离析的矛盾是更进一步地加深了。
