Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: Ten thousands of workers and students belonging to 200 Japanese groups, disregarding the obstruction and suppression by the US-Japanese reactionaries, participated in the "May 30th People's Congress" held by the Tokyo Preparatory Committee of the Democratic National Front in the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo on the 30th.

According to Tokyo reports: Participants in the "May 30th People's Congress" included progressive labor unions such as the All-Japan Metal Workers, the Japan Film and Theater Workers, the Private Railway Workers, and the All-Japan Transportation Workers, as well as units affiliated with the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations. The masses participating in the congress held high red flags and various placards with slogans such as: "We oppose war," "We demand peace," "We don't want US military bases," "We demand the withdrawal of the occupying forces," "Fight against anti-communist bills and measures," and "Down with Eells' anti-communist activities," etc.

Nosaka Sanzō, a member of the Political Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party, as well as representatives from the Labor-Farmer Party, the All-Japan Labor Union Liaison Committee, the Hitachi Works Labor Union, and the Toho Film Studio Labor Union, delivered speeches. The speakers denounced Japanese monopoly capital for dismissing thousands upon thousands of workers "in order to pave the way for foreign monopoly capital to enslave Japan." The speakers called on the masses to resist American movies and refuse to pay taxes used to suppress the working people and build military bases. The congress resolved: oppose the mass layoffs of workers by "Toho" and "Hitachi," oppose the Eells statement, oppose declaring the Communist Party illegal, oppose militarization and colonization, oppose war, and defend peace. After the meeting, the masses held demonstrations throughout Tokyo.

The US and Japanese reactionaries had obstructed the holding of the congress in every possible way. The congress was originally scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 30th in the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace, and prior permission had been obtained from the authorities. However, the Tokyo Police Department suddenly used the excuse that the US military was holding a memorial service for American fallen soldiers in the plaza and prohibited the masses participating in the People's Congress from entering the venue. This obstruction did not prevent the holding of the congress. During the congress, the US and Japanese reactionaries did their utmost to provoke. When a section of the masses discovered a saboteur and questioned him, several US military police officers rushed in to commit violence, arousing the indignation and loud opposition of the masses. The US military police wielded batons to beat the surrounding masses, injuring more than a dozen people. According to the Associated Press, the US military police arrested at least three Japanese people.

　　东京举行“五·三○人民大会”
    日本十万工人学生示威
    反对美帝把日本军事基地化与殖民地化
    【新华社三十一日讯】属于日本二百个团体的工人和学生十万人，不顾美日反动派的阻挠与镇压，于三十日在东京的皇宫前广场参加了民主民族战线东京筹备会所主办的“五·三○人民大会”。
    据东京消息：参加“五·三○人民大会”的有全日金属工人、日本电影演剧、私营铁道工人及全日交通运输等各进步工会，以及全日学生自治会联合会所属各单位。参加大会的群众高举着红旗和各种标语牌，上面写着：“我们反对战争”、“我们要求和平”、“我们不要美军建立军事基地”、“我们要求占领军撤退”、“与反共的法案与措施作斗争”以及“打倒意尔斯的反共活动”等。
    日本共产党政治局委员野坂参三以及劳农党、全日工会联络委员会、日立制作所工会及东宝电影制片厂工会的代表，都发表了演说。演说者斥责日本独占资本解雇成千成万的工人，“以便为外国垄断资本及奴役日本开辟道路”。演说者号召群众抵制美国电影，不缴纳用来镇压劳动人民及建造军事基地的捐税。大会决议：反对“东宝”、“日立”大批解雇工人，反对意尔斯声明，反对宣布共产党非法，反对军事基地化和殖民地化，反对战争，保卫和平。会后，大会群众在东京全市举行示威游行。
    美、日反动派对大会的举行曾横加阻碍。大会原定于三十日上午九时在皇宫前广场举行，事先且已获得当局的许可书。但东京警察局届时突然借口美军要在广场举行美国阵亡士兵纪念会，禁止参加人民大会的群众进入会场。这一阻挠手段，并未能阻止大会的举行。在大会进行过程中，美、日反动派曾极尽挑衅的能事。当大会一部分群众发现一个捣乱分子并加以盘问时，美国宪兵数名竟横冲直闯，赶来行凶，引起群众的愤慨与大声反对。美国宪兵曾挥舞木棍殴打四周群众，有十余人受伤。据美联社称：美国宪兵并至少逮捕了三名日本人。
