Xinhua News Agency, June 6th Dispatch: According to the US News Service in Washington: US President Truman submitted to Congress on the 1st the appropriation bill for the second year of the so-called "Mutual Defense Assistance Program." The total appropriation amounted to 1,222.5 million US dollars.

　　In order to deceive the American people and divert their attention from the fact that the American ruling group is using tens of billions of dollars in financial expenditures to prepare for a war of aggression, Truman, as usual, adopted the tactic of lying and spreading rumors and slanders in his message. Truman portrayed the North Atlantic Aggression Group as facing a fictitious threat of "aggression" and described the United States' continued arming of Western European countries with various offensive weapons as being for its "own security." In his report on the implementation of the so-called military aid program, Truman falsely claimed that the reason why the "Mutual Defense Program continues to be needed" is because "they (referring to the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union) continue to obstruct the efforts to achieve international control of atomic energy and disarmament"; because "they hinder the completion of peace treaties with Japan, Austria, and Germany"; because "they are now engaged in resisting most of the agencies of the United Nations," and so on. However, it is well known that it is US imperialism itself that takes the lead in the United Nations in vetoing the Soviet delegation's proposals to ban atomic weapons and implement universal disarmament, rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal that the five great powers conclude a pact to strengthen peace, and using majority votes to prevent the legitimate representatives of New China from participating in the United Nations, thereby paralyzing the work of the United Nations. It is also the American imperialists who are delaying the signing of peace treaties with Japan, Austria, and Germany, and are actively transforming Japan and West Germany into bases for launching new wars.

　　In addition to openly slandering the Soviet Union to the extreme, Truman also expressed extreme hostility and unease towards the national liberation movements of the people of New China and Southeast Asia. He referred to the fact that the Chinese people had freed themselves from the long-term brutal rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang and become masters of their own country as "the fall of China." He called the vigorous development of people's movements and armed struggles in various parts of Southeast Asia as the "intensification" and "further deterioration" of the "serious situation" in Southeast Asia.

　　It is with this kind of shameless lies and slanders, hysteria of hatred and fear, that Truman spreads the atmosphere of war in order to "prove" the "urgent and continuous need" for his arms race plan.

　　In addition, Truman also requested Congress to grant him greater powers so that he could freely allocate these appropriations and "aid" any country not mentioned in the bill at any time.

　　The allocation of funds in the appropriation bill proposed by Truman is as follows: one billion US dollars to "aid" the North Atlantic Aggression Group, 120 million US dollars to support the reactionary regimes of Greece and Turkey, 27.75 million US dollars to support the Quirino and Syngman Rhee puppet regimes and the Iranian reactionaries, and 75 million US dollars "for the general area of China."

　　杜鲁门散布谎言欺蒙人民提出“联防援助”拨款法案 
    要再以十余亿美元“援助”北大西洋侵略集团及各国反动政权
    【新华社六日讯】据美国新闻处华盛顿讯：美总统杜鲁门于一日向国会提出了所谓“联防援助计划”第二年度的拨款法案。拨款总额为十二亿二千二百五十万美元。
    为了欺蒙美国人民，使他们不注意美国统治集团将成百亿美元的财政开支，用于准备侵略战争的事实，杜鲁门在他的咨文中照例采用了撒谎和造谣诽谤的伎俩。杜鲁门将北大西洋侵略集团描绘成面临虚构的“侵略”的威胁，把美国之继续以各种侵略武器武装西欧国家说成是为了“本身安全”。杜鲁门在其所谓军援计划实施情况的报告中，诬称所以“继续需要联防计划”，是因为“他们（指以苏联为首的世界和平阵营）继续阻挠谋取原子能国际管制与裁减军备”；是因为“他们妨碍完成对日、对奥、对德的和约”；是因为“他们现在正在从事抵制联合国的大多数机构”等等。可是，尽人皆知，在联合国中带头否决苏联代表团所提禁止原子武器与实行普遍裁军的建议的，拒绝苏联关于五强缔结加强和平公约的，利用多数票阻挠新中国合法代表参加联合国，从而使联合国工作陷于瘫痪的，正是美帝国主义自己。而拖延对日、对奥、对德签订和约，并积极地将日本和西德转变为发动新战争基地的，也正是美帝国主义者。
    杜鲁门除公开对苏联极尽诬蔑之能事外，并表示了对新中国和东南亚人民民族解放运动的极端敌视与不安。他将中国人民摆脱帝国主义和国民党长期残暴统治而成为自己国家的主人的事实，称为“中国的陷落”。他将东南亚各地人民，运动和武装斗争的蓬勃发展的形势称为东南亚“严重情势的加剧”与“进一步恶化”。
    杜鲁门就是用这种无耻的谎言和诽谤、仇恨与恐惧的歇斯底里，散布战争气氛，以“证明”他的军备竞赛计划的“迫切与不断的需要”。
    除此之外，杜鲁门并要求国会授予他更大的权力，以便自由调度这些拨款，随时“援助”法案中未曾提到的任何国家。
    杜鲁门提出的拨款法案中的款项分配如下：以十亿美元“援助”北大西洋侵略集团，以一亿二千万美元支撑希腊与土耳其的反动政权，以二千七百五十万美元支持季里诺、李承晚傀儡政权和伊朗反动派，以七千五百万美元“用于中国一般地区”。
