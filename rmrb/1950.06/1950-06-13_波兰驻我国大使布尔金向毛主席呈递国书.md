When Ambassador Burgin presented his credentials, he delivered a eulogy to Chairman Mao Zedong, and Chairman Mao Zedong delivered a reply.

Ambassador Burgin's eulogy is as follows:
Mr. Chairman,

I have the honor to present to you the Letter of Credence from the President of the Republic of Poland, appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to your country.

I am fortunate to be the first to be honored with the glorious task of being an envoy to the great brotherly country, the People's Republic of China. Both our countries are striving towards one goal—socialism. In our struggle for peace and in our labor for building the foundations of socialism, we are walking side by side on the path opened up by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics under the leadership of the great Stalin.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to assure you that the Polish working people have always followed with the deepest concern and ardent sympathy the arduous, selfless, and heroic struggle of the Chinese people under your leadership, Mr. Chairman, for national and social liberation over the past decades. The Polish working class has long written the slogan of freedom for China on its battle banner and has struggled to realize this slogan to the best of its ability in its own position.

Please allow me, Mr. Chairman, to convey to you the brotherly sympathy and deep joy of our people for the historic and remarkable victory of the Chinese people over foreign imperialism and Chinese reactionaries.

In the war for the complete liberation of China, which is still continuing, our people are wholeheartedly with the Chinese people and hope that it will achieve complete victory as soon as possible.

I can assure you, Mr. Chairman, that in my position as Ambassador of the Republic of Poland, I will devote all my efforts to establishing and consolidating the fraternal relations between our people and the great Chinese people, and to establishing and strengthening political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the two countries. Although our countries are far apart, they are very close in terms of ideology and the fact that both belong to the great camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

Mr. Chairman, I will work here for the happiness of our two peoples and the entire camp to which our two countries belong, and I will work for the consolidation of world peace and the victory of democracy and socialism.

I request you, Mr. Chairman, to give me help and support in these efforts.

At the same time, Mr. Chairman, I request you to accept the best wishes of the President of the Republic of Poland for the People's Republic of China and yourself.

Chairman Mao Zedong's reply is as follows:
Mr. Ambassador,

I am very pleased to accept the Letter of Credence presented by Your Excellency, Ambassador, from the President of the Republic of Poland, and I thank you for your warm congratulations.

The profound friendship between the peoples of China and Poland has long existed. During the World Anti-Fascist War, we followed the firm and heroic struggle of the Polish people with infinite sympathy and concern, and today we admire the brilliant achievements of the Polish people in rebuilding their motherland.

Now the governments and peoples of China and Poland are continuing to work hard for the common goal of world peace. I believe that the increasingly close cooperation between China and Poland in political, economic, and cultural fields will not only benefit the two peoples, but will also strengthen and consolidate the camp of world democracy and peace.

I warmly welcome Your Excellency, Ambassador, as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Poland to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to assist you in your work to consolidate the friendship between the two countries.

I wish your country prosperity, your people flourishing, and the health of your head of state.

A Brief Biography of Burgin

Yuli Mikhailovich Burgin was born in 1906 in Warsaw, into the family of a painter. His mother and many relatives actively participated in the revolutionary movement. Imbued with the atmosphere of revolutionary struggle, Yuli Burgin participated in revolutionary work from a young age. When he was a sixteen-year-old worker, Yuli Burgin actively participated in armed demonstrations in Warsaw. He was wounded in street battles with the Polish bourgeois police.

Yuli Burgin joined the Polish Communist Party in 1925 and immediately became an active member of the party. In 1926, Yuli Burgin was arrested for the first time and held in solitary confinement for a year.

From then on, Yuli Burgin embarked on the path of an underground revolutionary worker, and he was constantly promoted to new and more important party positions. He served as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Youth League and Secretary of the Party District Committee. In total, Burgin was imprisoned in fascist prisons for as long as nine years.

The war forced Yuli Burgin to remain in the Warsaw fascist prison. Thanks to the rescue of his comrades, Burgin organized an escape for all the communists imprisoned in the prison. On the same day, he joined a volunteer team and went to the front.

After the German invaders occupied Poland, Burgin went to the Soviet Union, where he engaged in the work of the Polish Communist Party newspaper published by the Bolshevik Party.

From the day the German invaders attacked the Soviet Union, Burgin was mobilized to the front. Until 1943, Burgin worked in the army and engaged in propaganda work. When the new Polish People's Army was established in the Soviet Union, Burgin joined the ranks and fought until the end of the war. At the end of the war, he served as the Director of the Political Department of the Polish First Tank Brigade in Czechoslovakia with the rank of Colonel.

After the war, Burgin left the army to engage in leading work in state organs. Except for a period when he was entrusted by the Party Central Committee to serve as the chief writer of the Party Central Committee's newspaper, he held various positions until recently.

Until Burgin was appointed as the Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, he held a high-level position in the Ministry of National Defense.

Burgin has been awarded many medals and decorations for his work and contributions.

Burgin is married to a female Communist Party member who is the Director of the Fourth Department of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They have a ten-year-old son. (Xinhua News Agency)
