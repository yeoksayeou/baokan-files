Everyone Discusses Matters Together
    People's Representatives Conference Held in Six Districts of Beijing
    District Head Gao Yunchao Delivers Work Report for the Past Year
    Meeting is Discussing Proposals on Public Health Improvements and Repairing Dirt Roads
    [From Our Newspaper] The People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in the Sixth District of Beijing opened at 2:00 PM on May 31st. Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference Negotiating Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, both attended to provide guidance and delivered speeches. Guests attending the meeting included Qiu Elun, Counselor of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Central People's Government, Xue Zizheng, Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, heads of bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government, representatives of democratic parties and organizations in Beijing, and Zhang Taifeng, representative of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government.
    The meeting first approved the list of the presidium. Li Rui, Chairman of the Presidium and Secretary of the Sixth District Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered the opening speech. Deputy Mayor Wu Han then gave a speech, saying: Holding a people's representatives conference in a district is a first for Beijing. The experience of this meeting will be of significant help to the construction of democratic power in other districts of the city and even other cities across the country. He hoped that everyone would say what they wanted to say and make this meeting lively, cordial, and practical, living up to the two slogans displayed in the venue: "Our own government is managed by ourselves, and everyone handles matters together." Subsequently, Chen Dingwen, Fu Huating, and Zhang Taifeng, on behalf of the democratic parties in Beijing, the preparatory committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, respectively, delivered speeches and congratulations to the meeting. After a ten-minute break, the meeting began free speech. Twelve people, including iron industry worker Chang Fuhong and women's representative Chen Peizhen, spoke successively. In their free speeches, they all unanimously stated that the convening of the District People's Representatives Conference fully demonstrates that today the people are the masters of the country. This is the happiness brought to everyone by the great Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. Everyone must convey the resolutions of this meeting to the people, reflect the opinions of the people to the government, and make this meeting a success.
    Peng Zhen Attends and Speaks
    Chairman Peng Zhen of the Municipal Negotiating Committee was warmly welcomed by the representatives when he delivered his speech. He particularly emphasized: First, the affairs of the district are everyone's affairs, and everyone should handle them. How should everyone handle them? There must be an organization, and that is the District People's Representatives Conference. Once organized, everyone discusses the things to be done, and then everyone does them. Second, there are many things to do, so we must plan comprehensively and handle them according to their importance, urgency, and speed. This requires everyone to discuss and do it step by step according to our strength. Third, this representative conference includes a work report from the district office. Everyone at this meeting can review the government's past work and examine the work style of government cadres. The Communist Party has its constitution, the country has its laws, and administration has its discipline. Everyone should not hold back their words and should not be afraid of any retaliation. We will definitely impose due sanctions on those cadres who do not wholeheartedly serve the people and violate discipline. Only in this way can we maintain the purity of our government.
    [From Our Newspaper] The People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in the Sixth District of Beijing continued its general meeting on the morning of the 1st, listening to the work reports of the Sixth District (formerly the Eighth and Ninth Districts) District Office and the Outer First and Outer Second Branch Bureaus of the Public Security Bureau. In the afternoon, all representatives were divided into groups to discuss these two work reports.
    District Head Gao Yunchao gave explanations and self-criticisms on various tasks in his report. In terms of civil affairs: work was carried out to assist residents in production and employment, mediate disputes, provide preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and register resident marriages. In terms of health construction: work was carried out to remove garbage, prevent epidemics, and level dirt roads. In terms of culture and education: vocational schools, workers' night schools, children's remedial schools, adult remedial schools, and women's study classes were established, giving 6,114 out-of-school residents the opportunity to study. In addition, the district office assisted trade organizations and cooperatives in supplying residents with daily necessities, playing a role in stabilizing residents' lives during price fluctuations. In addition to the above achievements, there are still many shortcomings in the work. For example, forced orders occurred in disaster relief fundraising and the promotion of public bonds, and there were also individual cases of corruption and embezzlement by cadres. District Head Gao requested that all representatives examine the government's work and the work style of cadres, and actively put forward criticisms in order to thoroughly correct and improve.
    Xin Liang, Director of the Outer Second Branch Bureau of the Public Security Bureau, reported on the public security work of the Outer First and Outer Second Branch Bureaus over the past year, stating that they would work hard to strengthen contact with the broad masses of residents and thoroughly examine the work style and discipline of all police officers.
    Finally, Li Rui, Chairman of the Presidium, announced three proposals from the Preparatory Committee and the Sixth District District Office: launching a public health campaign in the summer and autumn seasons, repairing dirt roads, and repairing houses. Li Rui pointed out that these three proposals were put forward based on the current urgent needs of the broad masses of residents in the district. He hoped that all representatives would discuss and study them in depth. If these three problems could be properly solved, it would greatly benefit the improvement of residents' welfare.

    市协商委员会彭真主席发表演说时，受到代表们热烈的欢迎。他特别强调指出：一、区里的事是我们大家的事，要大家来办。大家怎么来办呢？一定要有一个组织，这便是区各界人民代表会议。组织起来了，大家所要办的事，大家来讨论，然后大家来办。二、事情很多，必须统盘筹划，分别轻、重、缓、急来办。这就要大家来讨论，按我们的力量，一步一步的做到。三、这次代表会议有区公所的工作报告，大家在这个会上可以检查一下政府过去的工作，检查一下政府干部的作风。共产党有党章，国家有法律，行政有纪律，大家不要话到嘴边留三分，也不要怕什么报复。我们对那些不全心全意为人民服务而违反纪律的干部，一定会予以应有的制裁，只有这样，才能保持我们政府的纯洁。
    【本报讯】京市第六区各界人民代表会议一日上午继续举行大会，听取第六区（原第八第九两区）区公所和公安局外一、外二两个分局的工作报告。下午，全体代表分成小组，对这两项工作报告进行了讨论。

    公安局外二分局局长辛良报告了一年来外一、外二两个分局公安工作，表示今后要努力加强与广大居民联系，彻底检查全体员警的工作作风和纪律。
