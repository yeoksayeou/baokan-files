　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, May 31st: The Wuhan Municipal People's Government has allocated 600,000 jin of grain to urgently aid unemployed workers and the poor who have already run out of food or are about to. The aid measures stipulate that each adult will receive 15 jin of cooked rice, children under eight years old will receive 10 jin, and especially impoverished unemployed workers will receive 20 jin. As of now, over 33,000 people have received 496,000 jin of the aforementioned relief grain. The distribution of relief grain is still ongoing and will be completed within days. In addition, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Cooperative Federation, with the consent of the Municipal Grain Company, has arranged for the company to allocate grain, which will be loaned without profit to members (including workers, farmers, teachers, and students) who have no grain or are short of grain, and to workers and farmers whose lives are truly difficult. Borrowers must repay within three months. This work concluded on May 24th, with over 100,250 people borrowing over 10,025,000 jin of grain. To ensure the smooth progress of the grain distribution, Wuhan Mayor Wu Defeng and more than 30 responsible personnel from relevant departments of the Municipal Government visited various districts to inspect the distribution situation and discovered and corrected shortcomings such as cumbersome registration procedures and slow distribution.
　　[Another Dispatch] The Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese People's Relief Association has now been established. Deputy Mayor of Wuhan, Chen Jingshu, serves as the chairman of the association. The current work of the association focuses on carrying out emergency relief. By the beginning of June, it will begin to organize self-help through production and send disaster victims back to their hometowns for production.
