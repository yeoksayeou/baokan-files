Agricultural University's Fifteen Professors and Teaching Assistants Form Work Group
To Guide Troop Production in Northeast Reclamation Area

[This newspaper report] Reporter Jin Feng reports: Fifteen professors and teaching assistants from Beijing Agricultural University went to the Northeast to help a certain unit with land reclamation and sowing for forty days from April 10th to May 20th. They were welcomed by the majority of officers and soldiers, collected a lot of practical teaching materials, and created a model of scientific and technological service for production and construction, combining theory and practice.

The soldiers who were reclaiming land in the vast desert urgently needed the guidance of science and technology.

The production scale and production tasks of a certain unit in Northeast China are very large, with more than 30,000 laborers, more than 10,000 heads of livestock, 450,000 mu of wasteland to be reclaimed, and a production task of producing 60 million jin of soybeans. In addition to a small number of officers and soldiers engaged in sideline production, the vast majority of officers and soldiers have invested in land reclamation and production. There were many difficulties encountered during the reclamation: the reclamation area was very desolate, and no people were seen within two to three hundred li. The troops first had to build shacks in the icy and snowy weather, dig wells, and establish transportation routes; and the area of wasteland was large and the types were different, including large wasteland, second wasteland, purple flower ridges, etc.; there were many types of soil, including black oil sandy soil, black sandy soil, white pulp soil, gray soil, loess, etc.; the natural environment was very complex, including plains, mountains, and swampy areas. In the process of land reclamation and production, the officers and soldiers overcame various material difficulties with high production enthusiasm, but they urgently needed the guidance of agricultural science and technology in understanding the characteristics of the natural environment and mastering production technology.

The Agricultural University Northeast Work Group went to the reclamation area to study the local situation and guide the troops' land reclamation and production work, and was warmly welcomed by the officers and soldiers.

The Northeast Work Group, composed of fifteen professors and teaching assistants from the seven departments of agronomy, soil science, horticulture, forestry, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and agricultural economics of the Agricultural University, inspected various reclamation areas through Jiamusi, Boli, and Mishan for more than a month. They measured the terrain, examined the soil quality, and understood the local natural conditions; and through inspections or holding discussions with the troops, they understood the situation and problems in the troops' production. At the same time, they visited local old farmers to understand the local production situation and characteristics, listened to the production experience of the villagers, and then compared, analyzed, researched, and discussed it to sort out the experience of the local farmers. They then summoned the officers and soldiers of the troops to report and answer questions to them. These reports were held twenty-two times, which was the main form of agricultural science and technology guidance for the troops' production by the professors. In these reports, the professors analyzed the local natural environment and the properties of various crops, so that the officers and soldiers understood the relationship between crops and the natural environment. They also made systematic scientific explanations on the problems that occurred in the local troops' production in terms of soil, cultivation methods, forestry, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine, and put forward many useful suggestions: such as the planning and comprehensiveness of land reclamation, long-term plans for production, fertilizer accumulation, flood prevention and drainage, afforestation, and rational feeding and management of livestock, so that the troops' production can be improved more rationally. They also answered many production questions raised by the officers and soldiers: such as how to identify the soil, how deep should the land be cultivated, how to build ridges, and why to build ridges, etc. A certain professor also drafted a song for the soldiers about the cultivation method: "Big ridges and deep ditches are not afraid of waterlogging, plow and cultivate with the plow to ensure seedlings, small plants and dense planting (large planting density, wide row spacing) will harvest more, three shovels and two steps will determine the harvest, fine work on the large wasteland (a kind of wasteland, the longest abandoned year) is better than mature land, timely sowing seedlings are strong," these songs, because they are related to the soldiers' production, are therefore loved and remembered by them. In addition, the professors used scientific theories to explain the good cultivation experience of the villagers to the officers and soldiers, and instilled agricultural science knowledge into the officers and soldiers: such as planting leguminous plants with rhizobium bacteria can increase the nitrogen in the soil and increase the nutrition of the soil, etc.; at the same time, they also criticized the narrow empiricism of the villagers. These have played a certain guiding role in the troops' production and improved the confidence of the officers and soldiers in production.

In practical work, the professors increased their practical knowledge of production and enhanced their confidence and enthusiasm in serving the motherland's production and construction.

On the other hand, the professors also gained academically and ideologically through this work. Many professors have increased a lot of practical production knowledge and collected a lot of practical teaching materials. For example, Professor Li Lianjie of the Soil Science Department read in textbooks twenty years ago that the best soil in the world is black soil. This time, he had the opportunity to see it in the Northeast and further understood the various properties of black soil. Professor Cai Xu of the Agronomy Department collected systematic special cultivation methods in Northeast China, such as foreign plows, two plows in one, and fine farming methods, and understood various methods of land reclamation, which can be used as the most practical teaching materials. At the same time, because the officers and soldiers of the troops have received certain political and cultural education, they believe in science and technology, making it easy for professors to promote agricultural technology in the troops, such as contour planting, small plant dense planting, etc., paving the way for a larger scale promotion of agricultural science and technology in the troops' production in the future.

In terms of ideology: the professors saw the soldiers' production enthusiasm (the reclamation area is at 133 degrees to 135 degrees east longitude and 44 degrees to 46 degrees north latitude. The sky is bright at three o'clock in the morning, and the soldiers lead their horses to the ground to work), hard work, study, and overcome difficulties (such as training horses pulling artillery to pull plows, the production efficiency is constantly improving, from a plow opening four or five mu of wasteland per day to opening thirty mu of wasteland per day, exceeding the reclamation efficiency of local skilled farmers), which deepened their feelings for the working people and their confidence in the motherland's production and construction. They also saw that the efficiency of collective production of the troops was one to two times higher than the efficiency of local individual small farmers' production, and saw that the officers and soldiers used collective wisdom to improve many production technologies and agricultural tools, thus concretely seeing the prospects of collective agriculture in the new China and deeply realizing the greatness of organized and led collective power. And the rich farming common sense and experience that the villagers told them also made them fully realize the diligence and wisdom of Chinese farmers, and strengthened their confidence in learning from old farmers, collecting and sorting out folk agricultural experience and technology in the future. These ideological and political gains of the professors have all confirmed the correctness of the new agricultural education policy of agricultural science facing production and combining theory and practice, thus greatly strengthening their determination to work hard for the new agricultural education policy.

　　农大十五位教授讲助教组成工作团
    到东北垦区指导部队生产
    【本报讯】记者金凤报道：北京农业大学教授、讲助教十五人自四月十日到五月二十日的四十天中，赴东北帮助某部队进行垦荒、播种，受到广大指战员的欢迎，并搜集了不少实际教材，创立了科学技术为生产建设服务、理论与实际相结合的范例。
    在广阔的荒漠中开垦的战士们，迫切需要科学技术的指导。
    东北某部队的生产规模和生产任务都很巨大，计有劳动力三万余人，牲口一万多头，开垦荒地四十五万亩，生产任务为生产大豆六千万斤。除一小部分指战员经营副业生产外，绝大部分指战员投入了垦荒生产。垦荒时遭遇困难极多：开垦地区甚为荒凉，有的二三百里内不见人烟，部队首先要在冰天雪地中建立窝棚，开凿水井，建立运输道路；而荒地面积大，种类不同，有大荒、二荒、紫花垄等；土壤种类多，有黑油沙土、黑沙土、白浆土、灰土、黄土等等；自然环境又十分复杂，有平原、山地及沼泽地带等。在开荒生产中，指战员们以高度的生产热情克服了物质上的种种困难，但在了解自然环境的特点、掌握生产技术方面他们却迫切需要农业科业及技术上的指导。
    农大东北工作团到垦区研究当地情况，指导着部队的开荒生产工作，受到指战员们的热烈欢迎。
    农大农艺、土壤、园艺、森林、畜牧、兽医、农经等七系十五位教授、讲助教所组成的东北工作团在一个多月中，经过了佳木斯、勃利、密山，视察了各个垦区。测量地形，考察土质，了解当地自然情况；又通过视察或和部队举行座谈，以了解部队生产中的情况和问题。同时访问当地老农，了解当地的生产情况和特点，听取老乡们的生产经验，再加以比较、分析、研究和讨论，整理了当地农民的经验。他们于是召集部队指战员，向他们报告和解答问题。此等报告共举行了二十二次，为教授们对部队生产进行农业科学及技术指导的主要形式。在这些报告中，教授们分析了当地的自然环境及各种耕作物的性质，使指战员们了解耕作物与自然环境的关系。他们又针对当地部队生产中在土壤、耕作法、森林、畜牧、兽医等方面所发生的问题，分别作系统的科学说明，并提出许多有用的建议：如垦荒的计划化和全面化、生产的长远打算、积肥、防洪排水、植树造林、牲口的合理喂养与管理等，使部队生产能更合理的改进。他们又解答了指战员所提出的许多生产上的问题：如怎样辨认土壤、耕地要耕多深、怎样筑垄以及为什么要筑垄等等。某教授并为战士们拟出了关于耕作法的歌谣：“大垅深沟不怕涝，随犁随耕准保苗，小株密植（播种密度大，株行距宽）收获多，三铲二踏定收成，大荒（荒地的一种，荒废年代最久）细作顶熟地，适期播种苗见壮”，这些歌谣，因为与战士们的生产有关，因之就为他们所喜闻乐记。此外，教授们根据科学的理论为指战员们解释老乡们良好的耕作经验，把农业科学知识灌输给指战员们：如种植豆科有根瘤菌的植物可以增加土壤中的氮素，增加土壤的营养等；同时他们也批判了老乡的狭隘经验主义。这些，都对部队生产起了一定的指导作用，提高了指战员们对生产的信心。
    教授们在实际工作中，增进了生产的实际知识，并增强了为祖国生产建设服务的信心与热情。
    另一方面，教授们通过了这次工作，也有了学理上及思想上的收获。许多教授增加了不少实际生产知识，搜集了不少实际教材。如土壤系教授李连捷在二十年前在教科书上读到世界上最好的土壤是黑盖土，这次去东北时才有机会看到，并进一步了解到黑盖土的各种性能。农艺系教授蔡旭则搜集了系统的东北特殊的耕作法如洋犁片、二犁一个、细作法等，了解了开荒的各种办法，可以作为最实际的教材。同时，由于部队指战员都接受过一定的政治上以及文化上的教育，他们相信科学、相信技术，使教授们易于在部队中推广农业技术，如等高调植、小株密植等，为今后在部队生产中更大规模地推行农业科学技术开辟了道路。
    在思想方面：教授们看到了战士们的生产热忱（垦区在东经一百三十三度到一百三十五度，北纬四十四度到四十六度、早晨三点钟即天亮，战士们就牵马下地工作）、艰苦劳动、钻研学习、克服困难（如训练拉炮的马来拉犁，生产效率不断的提高，由一付犁每天开荒四、五亩地的成绩提高到每天开荒三十亩，超过当地熟练农民的开荒效率）的精神，加深了他们对于劳动人民的感情以及对祖国生产建设的信心。他们又看到部队集体生产的效率比当地个体小农生产的效率提高了一倍到两倍，看到指战员们运用集体的智慧改进了很多生产技术和农具，因而具体地看到新中国集体农业的远景以及深刻地体会到有组织、有领导的集体力量的伟大。而老乡们告诉他们的丰富的农耕常识和经验，也使他们充分认识到中国农民的勤劳和智慧，加强了他们今后向老农学习、搜集和整理民间农业经验和技术的信心。教授们这些思想上以及政治上的收获，一一证实了农业科学面向生产、理论和实际结合的新农业教育方针的正确性，因而也就大大地加强了他们为新农业教育方针努力工作的决心。
