　　Wheat Gradually Matures from South to North, from Plains to Mountains
    Rural North China Enters Busy Wheat Season
    Harvest Generally Better Than Last Year Except in Some Disaster-Stricken Areas
    [Report from this newspaper] Comprehensive reports from various correspondents: This year's wheat in North China is generally better than last year's. The southern regions have begun harvesting, and some regions, after harvesting, are immediately turning to summer planting, summer hoeing, and pest control. The regions that have not yet harvested are also stepping up efforts to organize labor, rectify threshing grounds and granaries, and repair agricultural tools in preparation for the wheat harvest.
    Hebei Province has more than 30 million mu of wheat fields this year. Currently, Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, and other regions in the south of the province have generally entered the high tide of harvesting. Handan region began wheat harvesting on June 1st and is now nearing completion. Qiu County launched a five-day wheat harvesting campaign from May 31st to June 4th. The county's second district, with 45,610 mu of wheat, was completely harvested in four days, from June 1st to 4th. In Xingtai region, Neiqiu County started harvesting wheat on May 31st throughout the county. The first and second districts, which have the most wheat, were mostly harvested by June 3rd and basically completed on the 4th. In Lincheng County's first and second districts, a four-day intensive effort largely concluded the wheat harvest. Zhengding County in Shijiazhuang region, farmers harvested wheat day and night, and by June 10th, in just five days, they had harvested all 180,000 mu of wheat in the county. In Yuanshi County, the wheat harvest in the plains was largely completed by June 5th, and the mountainous areas are undergoing intensive harvesting. New wheat is already on the market. Farmers in Dahujia Village in Shen County, under the leadership of labor hero Gao Guandou, have basically completed the wheat harvest and summer planting, and are now, in conjunction with threshing, turning to hoeing seedlings and pest control.
    The wheat in Pingyuan and Shanxi provinces, except for some areas that suffered from hail, frost, and other disasters and experienced reduced harvests, generally had better yields than last year. Currently, the wheat harvest in Pingyuan Province has basically been completed. In Qingfeng County, under the organization and promotion of people's representatives in various villages, the wheat has largely been harvested, and summer planting is being actively organized. In Anyang County, the harvest work on more than 400,000 mu of wheat land is nearing completion. In Gaizu Village, Qi County, Party members and Youth League members took the lead in mutual assistance to harvest wheat, and the five-day plan was completed in three and a half days. Farmers in Xinting Town, Shen County, are busy harvesting. This year's wheat harvest is the best seen in the last four years.
    Shanxi Province has 15.6 million mu of wheat this year. Due to timely sowing last autumn, careful cultivation, and abundant rainfall this spring, the wheat generally grew well. Since the beginning of spring, nearly 12 million mu of wheat in the province have been hoed once. In Yuncheng region, counties such as Yishi, Yuanqu, and Anyi have hoed two or three times in many places. In Changzhi region, about 100,000 mu have been top-dressed with fertilizer, averaging 8 to 10 dan per mu. Most of the paddy field wheat in the province has been irrigated once. In Jiexiu, Quwo, Jiaocheng, and other places, concentrated use of sprayers and pesticides has exerted scientific pest control effectiveness, protecting the growth of wheat. However, some areas have suffered from frost, freezing, insect pests, and other disasters, especially several hail disasters in April and May, which caused damage to more than 1 million mu of wheat fields. From the province as a whole, if there are no more unexpected disasters, the wheat harvest will still exceed previous years. Currently, the southern regions have begun harvesting. On the vast plains of Yuncheng region, stretching from Yongji in the west to Wenxi and Jiang County in the east, the wheat harvesting campaign has been fully launched since June 1st. Farmers in Yuncheng City, under the slogan of "harvesting as it ripens, preventing wind and hail," harvested 150 mu of wheat in the few days from May 29th to June 1st and are continuing to rush the harvest.
    Before the wheat harvest, all regions made full preparations, and regions that have not yet harvested are continuing to prepare. To solve the difficulty of insufficient manpower and animal power, all regions universally organized mutual aid and labor exchange for the summer harvest; and universally held temple fairs for buying and selling draught animals and agricultural tools. In addition to purchasing agricultural tools themselves, farmers also received supplies from the supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties. Farmers in Ye County, Anyang region, Pingyuan Province, purchased more than 8,000 agricultural tools from the temple fairs. The Jiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi Province recently sold more than 3,700 harrows, sickles, and other tools to farmers in the county. The People's Governments of various counties in southern Shanxi recently also made a key distribution of agricultural tool loans. Farmers in three villages in the first district of Wenxi County alone borrowed more than 11,600 jin of loan grain. The Anyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Pingyuan Province also distributed 210,000 jin of agricultural tool loan grain. Yutai County distributed the third batch of 300,000 jin of production loan grain, as well as 1.1 million jin of food-for-work grain for levee restoration, ensuring the livelihood of the county's disaster victims in the ten days before the wheat harvest and allowing them to make the necessary preparations for the wheat harvest.

　　从南到北从平原到山地小麦渐次成熟
    华北农村全面进入麦忙时节
    除部分受灾地区外收成一般都比去年好
    【本报讯】综合各通讯员报道：华北全区今年小麦一般比去年好。南部地区已开始收割，部分地区在收割完毕后，即转入夏种、夏锄、除虫等工作。未收割地区，亦正加紧进行组织劳力、整顿麦场、麦仓、修置农具等收麦准备工作。
    河北省今年共有麦田三千余万亩。现该省南部的邯郸、邢台、石家庄等专区已普遍进入收割高潮。邯郸专区于六月一日开始麦收，现已接近完毕。邱县从五月三十一日至六月四日，进行五天收麦突击，该县二区四万五千六百一十亩小麦，于六月一日至四日的四天内，全部收割到家。邢台专区内邱县，全县从五月三十一日开始收麦，种麦最多的一、二两区，至六月三日大部割完，四日即基本上结束。临城县一、二两区，紧张突击四天，麦收工作大体结束。石家庄专区正定全县农民星夜收麦，至六月十日止，仅五天时间，即将全县十八万余亩麦子收割完毕。元氏县至六月五日，平原地带麦收大体告竣，山地部分地区正在突击收割，现已有新麦上市。深县大护驾庄农民，在劳动英雄高贯斗领导下，已基本完成了收麦、夏种，现已结合打场转入锄苗、治虫工作。
    平原和山西两省的小麦，除部分地区遭受雹、霜等灾害，收获减成外，一般收获量比去年好。现平原全省麦子已基本收割完毕。清丰县在各村人民代表的组织和推动下，小麦大体收割完毕，正积极组织夏种。安阳全县四十余万亩麦地，收割工作已接近完成。淇县盖族村，党团员带头，互助收麦，五天计划，三天半即全部收完。莘县莘亭镇农民，正忙于收割，今年的麦子丰收，为最近四年来所仅见。
    山西省今年一千五百六十万亩小麦，由于去秋播种适时，耕作周到，加上今春雨水充沛，一般长得好。入春以来，全省近千二百万亩的麦子普锄一遍。运城专区的猗氏、垣曲、安邑等县，多的锄到二、三遍。长治专区约有十万亩上了追肥，平均每亩达八担至十担。全省水田麦子大部浇过一次。介休、曲沃、交城等地，集中使用喷雾器与药剂，发挥了科学杀虫效力，保护了麦子的生长。但部分地区由于发生霜、冻、虫等灾害，特别是四、五月的数次雹灾，使一百余万亩麦田受到损失。从全省看来，如今后不再有意外灾害，小麦丰收，仍超过往年。现南部地区已开始收割，运城专区的大平原上，西起永济，东迄闻喜、绛县的辽阔产麦区，自六月一日起，已全面展开麦收运动。运城城关农民，在熟一块、割一块，严防风吹雹打的口号下，从五月二十九日至六月一日的几天中，割麦达一百五十亩，现仍继续抢收中。
    在麦收以前，各地都作了充分的准备工作，未收割地区仍在继续准备。为解决人、畜力不足的困难，各地普遍组织夏收的互助变工；并曾普遍举行买卖耕畜、农具的庙会，农民们除自购农具外，并获得各县供销社的供应。平原省安阳专区邺县农民，从庙会上购得农具八千余件；山西绛县供销社最近卖给该县农民的杈子、镰刀等即达三千七百多件。晋南各县人民政府，最近并曾有重点地发放了一次农具贷款，仅闻喜县第一区三个村农民，即借得贷粮一万一千六百多斤。平原省安阳专署，亦发放农具贷粮达二十一万斤。鱼台县发放第三批生产贷粮三十万斤，以及复堤以工代赈粮一百十余万斤，使该县灾民在距离麦收前十天的生活有了保障，并借以作麦收的必要准备工作。（高向明、程敬星、陆振华、高元芬、李振文、郭玉琳、路发魁、苑明远、徐爱民、贺祥五、郭际泰、党修生、王宪发、刘志鹏、朱忠智、吴汉杰、王庭栋、靳先为、遥远、郭玉栋、南铭、耿彦龄、张树欣、张连顺、张蕴华、王秀良、李金刚、周子峰、王相、达远、曙光、自箴、刘保身、韩德绪、李鸣、赵英才、树春、余字、号喜林、甄涤非、高顺古、张玉麟、张鹏九）
