Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 24th: Since liberation, under the guidance and assistance of the People's Bank, Shanghai's private financial industry has organized various joint loans, gradually guiding social idle capital into production. Under the guidance and promotion of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China, in September last year, 173 private banks and native banks in Shanghai formed a joint loan office, raising 40 billion yuan to lend to the cotton textile industry's joint cotton purchasing office, helping 52 yarn factories with capital shortages obtain more than 146,000 dan of raw cotton.

In December last year, the Shanghai branches of the People's Bank of China and the joint state-private China and Communications Banks, together with 161 private banks and native banks, raised 30 billion yuan to form the Shanghai Public-Private Financial Industry Joint Loan Office. By the end of May this year, they had successively lent out 24.5 billion yuan. These loans solved the difficulties of some manufacturers who lacked funds to purchase raw materials or had sluggish product sales due to seasonal factors and had poor capital turnover. For example, Sino-French Pharmacy was forced to halt production due to a lack of funds to purchase raw materials. After receiving a loan of 150 million yuan, it used 80 million yuan to buy raw materials and 70 million yuan to buy supplies for production. Labor and management thus increased their confidence in management and improved management methods. Now the factory has been able to break even. Another example is the "Kito DDT" company, which had difficulty maintaining production due to sluggish sales in the spring. After obtaining a loan of 50 million yuan, it has resumed normal production. After the start of summer, its products sold well, and it had repaid all loans by May.

In addition, the private financial industry also lent farmers materials in some areas to support agricultural production. In March, 18 banks and native banks, including China Trust, lent 50 tons of fertilizer and 80,000 jin of potatoes in Wujiang County, Southern Jiangsu. In April, another 35 private banks provided 4.5 million jin of bean cake loans to five counties, including Changshu, in Southern Jiangsu, to help farmers solve the problem of lack of seeds and fertilizer and carry out spring plowing in a timely manner.

In order to further expand the original foundation and organize private banks and native banks to serve production, the Shanghai Public-Private Financial Industry Joint Loan Office held a committee meeting on June 10 to discuss strengthening the organization and expanding joint lending operations, with a view to further expanding lending operations to support industrial production.

    上海人民银行指导私营行庄联合放款
    帮助私营工厂和农民生产
    【新华社上海二十四日电】解放以来，上海私营金融业在人民银行的指导和帮助下，组织各种联合放款，逐步引导社会游资投入生产专业。在中国人民银行上海分行的指导与推动下，去年九月上海全市一百七十三家私营银行与钱庄组成联合放款处，筹集资金四十亿元，贷给棉纺业联合购棉处，帮助资金短绌的五十二家纱厂获得原棉十四万六千多担。
    去年十二月间，人民银行和公私合营的中国、交通两个银行的上海分行暨私营行庄一百六十一家集资三百亿元，组成上海市公私金融业联合放款处，至今年五月底止，已先后贷出二百四十五亿元。这些贷款，解决了一些厂家缺少购买原料的资金或因季节关系发生的产品滞销资金周转不灵的困难。如中法药房，因缺乏资金购买原料，生产陷于停顿，自得到一亿五千万元贷款后，以八千万元买原料，七千万元买物料，进行生产，劳资双方因而增加了经营信心，并改善经营方法，现该厂已能保本自给。又如“鬼头牌ＤＤＴ”公司，因春季销路呆滞，生产难以维持，自获得贷款五千万元后，已恢复了正常生产；入夏后，产品畅销，五月份即已将全部贷款还清。
    此外，私营金融业并在若干地区以实物贷给农民，扶植农业生产。三月份中信等十八家行庄在苏南吴江县贷放肥田粉五十吨和马铃薯八万斤。四月份又有三十五家私营银行到苏南地区的常熟等五县举办了为数四百五十万斤的豆饼贷款，帮助农民解决缺种缺肥的问题，以及时进行春耕。
    上海市公私金融业联合放款处为了进一步扩大原有基础，组织私营行庄为生产服务，曾于六月十日召开委员会，讨论加强组织与扩大联放业务等问题，以期进一步展开扶助工业生产的放款业务。
