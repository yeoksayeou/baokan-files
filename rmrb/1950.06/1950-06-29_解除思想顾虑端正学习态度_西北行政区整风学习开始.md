　　Eliminating Ideological Concerns and Correcting Learning Attitudes
    Rectification Study Begins in the Northwest Administrative Region
    [Xi'an News] The Masses Daily News reports: Since the Northwest Grand Administrative Region-level General Study Committee and the directly subordinate Party Committee announced the study plan for rectifying the work style of Party member cadres, up to June 20th, nine major units, including the major systems and organs at the Northwest Region level, as well as Shaanxi Province, Xi'an City, and the Shaanxi Military Region, have expanded and strengthened their original study committees in accordance with the general study plan, or implemented partial reorganizations. These new branch General Study Committees generally include administrative leaders, Party committees, branches, and active elements among the cadres. The Supervision Committee branch General Study Committee has unified the Party's small groups and study groups to facilitate close cooperation between Party members and non-Party cadres in their studies. Most branch General Study Committees have formulated detailed study plans based on the study plans of the General Study Committee and the directly subordinate Party Committee, in conjunction with the specific conditions of their units. Some branch General Study Committees have also incorporated the problems exposed in the previous anti-bad tendency movement into their plans, preparing for further analysis and criticism in this study. Regarding the establishment of meeting and reporting systems, some branch General Study Committees or branch study committees have also stipulated study discipline. For example, the study discipline of the Ministry of Justice, the Northwest Branch of the Supreme People's Court, and the Northwest Branch of the People's Procuratorate branch General Study Committee is: Guarantee three hours of study every day. Everyone must write notes and reflections connecting their work and thoughts. When others offer opinions, they should record the main points of the opinions in preparation for a general response in the future, etc.
    In their mobilization, each branch General Study Committee and branch study committee emphasized the significance of this rectification study, dispelling ideological concerns. For example, when the Supervision Committee and the Discipline Inspection Committee branch General Study Committee convened a mobilization meeting for all cadres, they first held Party and Youth League group meetings to gather everyone's understanding and concerns about the rectification study, discovering that most comrades had the following two ideological deviations: First, they feared that offering opinions would harm harmony and offend people; they feared that criticizing leaders would be detrimental to themselves (mostly non-Party new cadres); (2) those who had shortcomings themselves were unwilling to offer opinions to others (both new and old cadres); individual Party members with a longer history of struggle believed that they were being "rectified," so they had no intention of offering opinions to others at all. These ideological concerns were fully explained at the mobilization meeting. In particular, Party member leaders sincerely and repeatedly assured everyone that they would accept everyone's criticism with the spirit of "the hearer should take warning," and would never retaliate, urging everyone to speak their minds. For example, in the General Office of the Military and Political Committee, some non-Party cadres believed that they were "being welcomed" in the rectification study, standing aside to see how the Party members would carry out the rectification; while some individual Party members believed that the participation of non-Party cadres in the study was "invited," and therefore did not pay enough attention to them. The branch study committee has prepared to explain to everyone the correct relationship between the Party and the non-Party masses in the rectification study. Now the plans of each study committee have been announced, and each department has entered the first stage of the rectification study movement—beginning to study the documents.

　　解除思想顾虑端正学习态度
    西北行政区整风学习开始
    【西安讯】群众日报消息：自西北大行政区一级总学委及直属党委关于整顿党员干部作风学习计划公布后，至六月二十日止，西北区一级各大系统及机关，以及陕西省、西安市、陕西军区共九个大单位，已经按照学习总计划将原来的学委加以扩大和加强，或实行了部分改组。在这些新的分总学委中，一般都包括了行政首长、党委、支部及干部中的积极分子。监察委员会分总学委并将党的小组和学习小组统一起来，以便党员与非党干部在学习中密切合作。各分总学委大都根据总学委及直属党委的学习计划，结合本单位的具体情况，订出了详细的学习计划。有些分总学委，并将前一时期反不良倾向运动中暴露的问题写入计划，准备在此次学习中做进一步的分析批判。在建立会议、汇报制度方面，有些分总学委或分学委，还规定了学习的纪律。如司法部、最高人民法院西北分院、人民检察署西北分署分总学委的学习纪律是：每日保证三小时学习。每人都要联系工作、连系思想写笔记心得。别人对自己提意见，应将意见的要旨记上，准备将来总的答复等等。
    各分总学委及分学委在动员中，着重讲明这次整风学习的意义，打破思想顾虑。如监察委员会、纪律检查会分总学委，在召开全体干部动员大会时，先开党、团的小组会，搜集大家对整风学习的认识与顾虑，发现大部同志中存在以下两种思想偏差：一、怕提意见伤了和气，得罪人；怕批评首长对己不利（多为非党的新干部）；（二）自己有缺点的不愿再给别人提意见（新老干部都有）；个别斗争历史较长的干部党员，则认为自己是被“整”者，所以根本就不打算给别人提意见。这些思想顾虑，在动员大会都作了充分的解释。特别是党员领导同志，都诚恳的再三向大家提出保证：一定要以“闻者足戒”的精神，接受大家的批评，决不报复，要大家把心里的话都说出来。又如军政委员会办公厅，有些非党干部认为自己在整风学习中是“被欢迎的”，站在一边看党员怎么整；而有个别党员则认为非党干部参加学习是“聘请”来的，因此对他们不够重视。该分学委已准备向大家说明党与非党群众在整风学习中的正确关系。现在各学委的计划已经宣布，各部门已进入整风学习运动的第一阶段——开始学习文件。
