　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th: As of May 25th, the national grain transfer work has completed 81.09% of the total task. Among these, the Central-South region had originally planned to transfer 678 million jin of grain to North China, Northwest China, and East China, but it has exceeded the target, surpassing the original task by more than 3.54%. Its internal adjustment within the region has also completed 72%. The total grain task for internal adjustment in the East China region, which has suffered greater disasters, is 520,050 tons, and 309,455 tons have been completed. The transfer of 115,000 tons of rice from Sichuan to Shanghai has also overcome various difficulties and completed 27,000 tons. The grain transferred from Northeast China to East China and North China has reached 785,000 tons, accounting for 98.13% of the original task of 800,000 tons. The 15,000 tons of coarse grains transferred from North China to East China have already been fully completed.

　　In the past few months, large-scale grain transfers have played a significant role in supplying sufficient grain to major cities, industrial and mining areas, and various disaster areas, stabilizing prices, and helping people in disaster areas overcome the famine. Since the transfer work started in January, grain prices in six major cities, including Shanghai and Tianjin, began to gradually decline in March. For example, the average market price of rice in Chongqing in March was 1,177 yuan per jin, which fell to 994 yuan in April, and further to 983 yuan in May. The average market price of rice in Shanghai was 1,731 yuan per jin in March, 1,626 yuan in April, a decrease of 6%; and 1,646 yuan in May, the same as in April. The average market price of rice in Tianjin was 2,156 yuan per jin in March, 1,666 yuan in April, a decrease of 23%, and 1,481 yuan in May, a decrease of 11%. Grain prices in Hankou and Guangzhou also fell similarly.

　　According to past experience, March to May is usually a period of grain shortage, and grain prices soar. However, this year is completely the opposite, and grain prices have remained stable. The reason is that grain-deficient areas have obtained sufficient grain due to the planned national transfer. For example, cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing now have sufficient grain reserves to guarantee supply for three to five months without any problems. The social trend of panic buying and hoarding has fundamentally changed, and speculators have been completely crushed.

　　This time, the grain transfer in various places has fully taken into account the local supply. This can be seen from the trend of grain price changes in Nanchang, Changsha, Xuchang, and other places that have transported more grain since March. The average market price of rice in Nanchang in March was 1,231 yuan per jin, 929 yuan in April, and 839 yuan in May. In Changsha, it was 1,350 yuan in March, 1,150 yuan in April, and 987 yuan in May. The average market price of wheat in Xuchang in March was 1,731 yuan per jin, 1,015 yuan in April, and 815 yuan in May. The average grain prices in the above three places are lower than those in larger cities, and the trend is also downward. At the beginning of the grain transfer, some farmers in some areas were worried that there would be a grain shortage locally after the grain was transported away. This concern was quickly dispelled by the facts. For example, Hunan Province only transported 235 million jin of grain this time, which is only 2.14% of its normal annual output of 11 billion jin, and naturally will not have any impact on the local grain supply.

　　Grain-deficient Areas Will No Longer Rely on Foreign Rice; Grain-producing Areas Begin to Avoid "Cheap Grain Hurts Farmers"

　　In the past, due to the fact that the Kuomintang bandit gang never considered the interests of the people and made overall adjustments, they blindly relied on foreign rice. Therefore, there was a phenomenon of large-scale imports of foreign rice on the one hand, and "cheap grain hurts farmers" on the other. The largest number of foreign rice imports in history (1935) reached 12,093,903 tons. The largest number of foreign rice imports in Shanghai (1948) reached 5,521,504 dan. And in Sichuan Province, which produces a large amount of rice, farmers were forced to switch to growing opium because the grain could not be transported out and the grain price was too low. This year, the Central People's Government had originally planned to absorb 200 million jin (100,000 tons) of foreign rice imports in addition to organizing grain transfers in various places to supplement possible shortages. Now, only 20 million jin (10,000 tons) have been absorbed. Because the national grain transfer work is nearing completion, no more foreign rice is needed. On the other hand, the phenomenon of "cheap grain hurts farmers" in grain-producing areas in the past has also begun to be avoided this year. For example, in Gan County, Jiangxi Province, the grain price was only 400 to 500 yuan per jin in December last year. Because part of the surplus grain was transported out, the grain price has now been appropriately increased. In the past, the scissor difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products in various places has also been greatly reduced. For example, in Xi'an, during the rule of the Hu-Ma bandit gang, one dou of wheat could only be exchanged for more than two chi of cloth, but now one dou of wheat can be exchanged for more than five chi of cloth.

　　Various places adopted the method of "work-for-relief" when transferring grain, which solved the difficulties of food and seeds for some farmers. For example, in the Changde area of Hunan Province, which was severely affected by floods, the organization of grain transportation solved the life and production problems of more than 88,000 disaster victims. Farmers transporting grain in Jiangxi Province can earn more than 20 jin of rice per day. Therefore, farmers in various places are extremely enthusiastic about transporting grain, which guarantees the rapid completion of the grain transportation task.

　　全国粮食调运接近完成
    供应大城市工矿区及灾区足够的食粮
    三月来粮价始终平稳投机商一蹶不振
    【新华社十六日讯】全国粮食调运工作截至五月二十五日止，已完成总任务的百分之八十一·○九。其中中南区原定调往华北、西北及华东的粮食六亿七千八百万斤已超额完成，较原定任务超过百分之三点五四以上；其本区内部调剂亦已完成了百分之七十二。灾区较大的华东区内调剂粮总任务为五十二万零五十吨，已完成了三十万九千四百五十五吨。由四川调往上海的大米十一万五千吨，也已克服各种困难完成了二万七千吨。由东北调往华东及华北的粮食已达七十八万五千吨，为原定任务八十万吨的百分之九十八·一三。由华北调往华东的杂粮一万五千吨早已全部完成。
    数月来大规模的粮食调运在供应大城市、工矿区以及各灾区以充足的粮食，在稳定物价以及使灾区人民度过灾荒上，都起了巨大的作用。调运工作于一月份开始，三月份起，上海、天津等六大城市的粮价便开始逐渐下跌。如重庆市三月份大米平均每斤市价一千一百七十七元，四月份跌为九百九十四元，五月份再跌为九百八十三元。上海三月份大米平均每斤市价为一千七百三十一元，四月份为一千六百二十六元，下跌了百分之六；五月份为一千六百四十六元，和四月份持平。天津三月份大米平均每斤市价为二千一百五十六元，四月份为一千六百六十六元，下跌了百分之二十三，五月份为一千四百八十一元，下跌百分之十一。汉口和广州粮价也同样下跌。
    按历来每年三五月间本是青黄不接时期，粮价飞涨，但今年却完全相反，粮价始终平稳，其原因就在于各缺粮地区因全国有计划地调运而获得了足够的粮食。如上海、天津、北京等城市，现有存粮可保证供应三、五个月而无问题，社会上抢购囤积之风已根本改变；投机商更一蹶不振。
    此次各地调运粮食是充分照顾了当地的供应的，这可以从运出粮食较多的南昌、长沙、许昌等地三月份以来粮价变化趋势中看出来。南昌三月份大米平均每斤市价为一千二百三十一元，四月份为九百二十九元，五月份为八百三十九元。长沙三月份为一千三百五十元，四月份为一千一百五十元，五月份为九百八十七元。许昌三月份小麦平均每斤市价为一千七百三十一元，四月份为一千零十五元，五月份为八百十五元。以上三地粮食平均价格都较大城市为低，其趋势也是下跌的。运粮开始时，有些地区的农民曾有怕粮食运走后本地闹粮荒的顾虑，这种顾虑迅即被事实打破。如湖南省这次运出粮食仅二亿三千五百万斤，只及其常年产量一百一十亿斤的百分之二点一四，对当地粮食的供应自然不会有什么影响。
    缺粮地方将不再仰赖洋米  产粮区开始避免谷贱伤农
    历来由于国民党匪帮从未为人民利益打算而作通盘调剂，一味仰赖洋米，所以曾有一方面大批洋米进口，另一方面却又谷贱伤农的现象。历年洋米入口数最多时（一九三五年）曾达一千二百零九万三千九百零三吨，上海洋米入口数最多时（一九四八年）竟达五百五十二万一千五百零四石。而产米极多的四川省因粮食运不出，粮价过低，农民纷纷被迫将粮田改种鸦片。今年中央人民政府原曾计划在组织各地调运以外，再吸收两亿斤（十万吨）洋米进口，以补可能的不足，现在仅吸收了两千万斤（一万吨），因我国内粮食调运工作的趋于完成，便不再需要更多的洋米了。另一方面，产粮区历来谷贱伤农现象，在今年也已开始避免。如江西省赣县，去年十二月间粮价每斤只四、五百元，因余粮外运一部分，现在粮价已适当提高。过去各地工农产品价格的剪刀差额也已大大缩小，如西安在胡马匪统治时，一斗麦只能换二尺多布，现在一斗麦可换五尺多布。
    各地调运粮食时采取了以工代赈的办法，解决了部分农民口粮和种子的困难。如水灾严重的湖南省常德区，在组织运粮中即解决了灾民八万八千余人的生活与生产问题。江西省运粮农民每人每天能得工资大米二十斤以上。因此各地农民运粮极为踊跃，保证了运粮任务的迅速完成。
