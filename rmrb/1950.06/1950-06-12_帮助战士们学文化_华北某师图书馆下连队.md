　　Helping Soldiers Learn Culture
　　Library of a Certain Division in North China Goes to the Companies
　　[This Newspaper's News] The library of the Political Department of a certain division of the People's Liberation Army North China Military Region selected a large number of picture books, pictorials, and other reading materials and photographs for soldiers, and went deep into the companies to hold exhibitions during the soldiers' production rest time. When the exhibition team arrived at the Third Company of the First Battalion of a certain regiment, the soldiers were having breakfast. After the duty squad leader told everyone, some people watched the books while holding their rice bowls. While reading, soldier Wang Fenggao said, "Where are these books sold? When I get my allowance, I must buy one." Zhang Mingde, the deputy squad leader of the machine gun squad of the First Platoon of the Seventh Company, said after reading "The Story of the Blind Worker's Grievance": "Reading this book is like attending a political class. After reading about the blind worker carrying work for the landlord, I remembered the suffering I used to have when I worked for the landlord. I must do my work well in the future." Some soldiers shed tears of excitement after reading "Northeast Heroine Zhao Yiman" and "Passionate Man." When they saw the Soviet labor pictorials, they felt great excitement and encouragement. The communications squad leader of the Third Battalion said, "We are now starting production and construction, and in the future, we will be able to live a happy life like the Soviet people!"

　　帮助战士们学文化
    华北某师图书馆下连队
    【本报讯】人民解放军华北军区某师政治部图书馆，挑选大批连环画、画报等战士读物和照片，深入连队，利用战士生产休息时间举行展览。展览队到某团一营三连时，战士们正在吃早饭，值星班长告诉大家后，有的人就端着饭碗围着看起书来。在看书时，战士王凤高说：“这书那儿有卖的？发津贴时，我非买一本不可。”七连一排机枪班副班长张铭德同志看过《瞎目工伸冤记》后说：“看这书就像上了一次政治课。我看了瞎目工给地主扛活的事情，就想起我过去给地主扛活的苦处来，今后一定要好好干工作。”有的战士看了《东北女英雄赵一曼》、《热血男儿》以后，激动的掉下泪来。看到苏联劳动画报时，则感到很大的兴奋与鼓舞。三营通讯班长说：“我们现在正开始生产建设，将来，咱们也能过着像苏联人民那样美满的生活！”
