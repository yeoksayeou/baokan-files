Overview of Prices and Finance in May
    Yang Fangxun
    Prices
    Nationwide prices, which began to decline in March, gradually stabilized by late April. By May, they had basically stabilized. Compared to the end of April, they rose by only 0.7%. This is due to the active control and planned purchasing and selling by the state-owned trading sector. For example, in mid-May, the Shanghai Trading Company adopted the policy of "purchasing cotton yarn when it falls below 5 million yuan and selling it when it rises above 5 million yuan," which resulted in the price of cotton yarn remaining stable around 5.1 million yuan. The price indices of key domestic commodities in six major cities—Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, and Xi'an—are listed below:
    
     Month   Date April 30 May 2nd  10th  15th  20th  25th  Monthly Average Index
     100       97.8   100.1 100.3   100   100.7   100.24
    While general prices were stable, import and export prices rose due to increased demand. Tianjin's import prices rose by 17% at the end of May compared to the end of April; export prices rose by 7% in May. This is a temporary phenomenon, and it should stabilize in the future.
    At the same time, due to the recovery and growth of real purchasing power, the sluggish sales of goods in March and April gradually changed in May. This is reflected in the increase in market transaction volume. For example, in Tianjin, the total transaction volume of wheat flour in early May was 86,000 bags, and in late May it was 100,400 bags, an increase of 20.9%; in Shanghai, the total transaction volume of yarn in early May was 2,600 pieces, and in late May it was 3,900 pieces, an increase of 15%.
    As prices have stabilized after a three-month decline, market transactions have shifted from stagnation to activity; the phenomenon of market prices being lower than listed prices has also gradually changed. In some areas, the listed prices and market prices are close to equilibrium, and in other areas, the difference has narrowed; however, in some areas, the difference is still considerable due to insufficient adjustment. The listed prices and market prices of yarn in several cities on May 31 are listed below (unit: 10,000 yuan):
      
      Tianjin Taiyuan Shanghai Hankou Guangzhou Chongqing Chengdu
      Market Price 577  584  513  564  585  525 480
      Listed Price 577  584  525  570  590  600 692
   Percentage by which
   market price is
   below list price  Equal  Equal  2.3  1.1  0.9  14.3 44.2
    This phenomenon of market prices being lower than listed prices is temporary and will tend to normalize after continued adjustments.
    However, there are still unreasonable differences between regions, which affect the normal circulation of commodities. Taking the Tianjin No. 2 Factory's Wufu cloth as an example, on May 30, the price index in Tianjin was 100, in Baoding it was 102, and in Zhangjiakou it was 101. The price difference is too small, which is not conducive to traders' transportation, and further adjustments are still needed.
    Finance
    As for finance, because inflation has stopped and the National Bank has strengthened its control, interest rates have gradually decreased, and deposit and loan business has gradually expanded. The situation of interest rates, deposits and loans, and remittances is described below:
    Interest Rates
    In order to reduce the burden on industry and commerce and adapt to the new situation of stable prices, the People's Bank took the initiative to lower interest rates in late March. Interest rates continued to decline in the first half of May, and then stopped declining in the second half of the month and tended to stabilize. After May 15, the monthly interest rate on fixed deposits in the People's Bank across the country was generally around 1.5%, and the monthly interest rate on loans was around 3%. The interest rates of private banks and financial institutions also decreased with the reduction of interest rates by the National Bank.
    Deposits
    Deposits in both public and private banks increased in May. According to statistics from seven major cities: at the end of May, the deposit balance of the National Bank increased by 32% compared to the end of April, and the deposits of private banks and financial institutions increased by 12%.
    Loans
    In order to support private industry and commerce, the National Bank increased loans in May. Compared to the end of April, it increased by 49%. Loans from private banks and financial institutions increased by only 0.3%. Joint lending offices and syndicates in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places have expanded their lending business compared to the past.
    Domestic Remittances
    The amount of remittances in both public and private banks increased in May. The total amount of remittances out and in by the People's Bank in late May increased by 3.5% compared to late April, and private banks and financial institutions increased by 10.6%.
    The increase in remittances reflects the increasing activity of domestic trade. With the development of material exchanges between urban and rural areas, the amount of remittances will increase further.
    Foreign Exchange
    Foreign exchange prices were stable in May. For example, the listed price of US dollars in Tianjin remained unchanged at 37,500 yuan after falling from the end of April. This is consistent with the stable domestic prices.
    Securities
    In the financial market in May, securities prices fluctuated the most. The stock of Qixin Cement Company on the Tianjin Stock Exchange rose from 660,000 yuan (100,000 shares) at the end of April to a peak of 1.35 million yuan on May 18, more than doubling the price at the end of April. After the 19th, it gradually declined, and at the end of May it was 1.05 million yuan. The fluctuation of securities prices is also reflected in the fact that they rise and fall several times within a day with considerable amplitude. For example, on May 17, the highest price of Qixin stock in Tianjin was 1.3 million yuan, and the lowest price was 1.06 million yuan, a difference of 22%. At the same time, the actual settlement amount in securities transactions also increased. For example, in Tianjin, the settlement amount accounted for 9.7% of the transaction amount in April and 11% in May.
    The rise in securities prices under these stable financial and price conditions reflects that social idle funds are seeking an outlet after the cessation of inflation. On the one hand, it reflects a good trend, that is, legitimate industry and commerce have bright prospects, funds flow to the industrial sector, and thus industrial stock prices are firm. However, on the other hand, it also reflects a bad trend, that is, social idle funds have not yet been invested in real production capital, but are hovering in the securities market, seeking profits from the difference between the purchase and sale of securities, and even tending to become a disguised speculation. Therefore, how to guide social idle funds to the direction of developing production in the future is an urgent issue to be addressed.

　　五月份物价金融概述
    杨方勋
    物价
    全国各地物价，于三月开始下落，至四月下旬渐趋平稳。五月份则已基本上达到稳定。五月底与四月底比较，仅上升百分之○·七。这是国营贸易部门主动掌握，有计划地进行收购和出售所作出的成绩。如五月中旬，上海贸易公司对棉纱采取“落到五百万元以下收购，涨到五百万元以上出售”的方针，结果使棉纱价格始终稳定在五百一十万元上下。兹将上海、天津、广州、汉口、重庆、西安六大城市国内基要商品物价指数列在下面：
     四月   五月日期 三十日 二日     十日      十五日     二十日 二十五日   全月平均指数 一○○ 九七·八 一○○·一一○○·三 一○○ 一○○·七 一○○·二四
    一般物价虽然平稳，但进出口货价格，却因需求增加而上升。天津进口货五月底与四月底比较上升百分之十七；出口货五月份上涨百分之七。这是暂时的现象，今后当能转趋稳定的。
    同时，由于真实购买力的恢复和增长，三、四月份的货物滞销现象，到五月份也已逐渐改变。这表现为市场成交量的增加。如天津五月上旬麦粉总成交量为八万六千袋，下旬为十万零四千袋，增加百分之二○．九；上海五月上旬纱的总成交量为二千六百件，下旬为三千九百件，增加百分之十五。
    由于三个月来物价由落转稳，市场交易已由停滞转趋活跃；市价低于牌价的现象，亦已逐步改变。有的地区的牌价和市价已接近平衡，有的地区的差额则已缩小；但，有的地区的差额则因调整不够，仍有相当距离。兹将五月三十一日几个城市纱的牌价和市价列在下面（单位万元）：
      天津   太原    上海    汉口    广州    重庆       成都
      市价    五七七 五八四  五一三  五六四  五八五  五二五  
   四八○
      牌价    五七七 五八四  五二五  五七○  五九○  六○○  
   六九二
  市价低于牌
  价的百分比      平     平  二·三  一·一  ○·九  一四·三
   四四·二
    这种市价低于牌价的现象是暂时的，经过继续调整是会趋于正常的。
    但是，地区间的差额，尚存在着不合理的现象，以致影响了商品的正常流转。以天津二厂五福布为例，五月三十日天津价格指数为１００，保定为１０２，张家口为１０１，差价太小，不利于商人的贩运，则是仍须继续努力调整的。
    金融
    至于金融方面，由于通货膨胀已经停止，国家银行又加以大力掌握，所以利率已逐渐降低，存放款业务已逐渐开展。兹将利率、存放款和汇兑等的情况分述如后：
    利率
    人民银行为了减轻工商业负担，适应物价稳定的新情况，三月下旬即主动降低利率。五月上半月利率仍在下降，至下半月停止下降，转趋稳定。五月十五日以后，全国人民银行定期存款月息，一般均在一分五厘左右，放款月息则是三分左右。私营行庄的利率，亦随着国家银行的利率降低而下降。
    存款
    五月份公私银行存款均有增加。根据七大城市统计：五月底国家银行存款余额，较四月底增加百分之三十二，私营行庄存款增加百分之十二。
    放款
    为了扶植私营工商业，五月份国家银行放款增加。五月底与四月底比较，增加百分之四十九。私营行庄放款仅增加百分之○·三。上海、天津等地的联合放款处与银团，放款业务则较过去开展。
    内汇
    五月份公私银行的汇兑额，均有增加。人民银行五月下旬汇出汇入总额，较四月下旬增加百分之三·五，私营行庄增加了百分之一○·六。
    汇兑增加，反映了国内贸易日渐活跃，随着城乡物资交流的开展，汇兑额是更会增加的。
    外汇
    五月份外汇价格是稳定的。如天津美汇牌价，自四月底降为三万七千五百元后，一直没有变动。这和国内物价稳定的情况是吻合的。
    证券
    五月份金融市场中，证券价格波动最大。天津证券交易所启新洋灰公司股票，四月底六十六万元（十万股），五月十八日涨到一百三十五万元的最高峰，较四月底涨了一倍强。十九日以后，逐渐下降，五月底为一百零五万元。证券价格的波动，还表现在一日之内涨落数次且幅度颇大。如五月十七日天津启新股票最高价一百三十万元，最低价一百零六万元，相差百分之二十二。同时，证券成交中的实际交割额也有所增加。如天津四月份交割额占成交额百分之九·七，五月份为百分之十一。
    在此金融物价稳定的情况下，出现了证券价格的上涨现象，是反映了在通货膨胀停止之后，社会游资正在要求出路。一方面反映了好的趋势，那就是正当工商业有着光明的前途，资金流向工业方面，因而工业股票价格坚挺。但，另一方面又反映了不好的趋势，那就是社会游资尚未投向真正的生产资本，而徘徊于证券市场，从证券的出入差额上谋取利润，甚至有趋向变相投机的倾向。因此，今后如何引导社会游资投向发展生产的方向，是亟须注意的问题。
