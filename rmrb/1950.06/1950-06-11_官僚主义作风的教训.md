　　Lessons from Bureaucratic Work Style
　　CPC Mancheng County Committee
　　In April of this year, Wang Yuhua, Deputy Secretary of the Mancheng County Committee of Hebei Province, discovered serious problems in the work of Huazhuang Village, Second District, while leading cotton planting. Some Party members and cadres in the village (actually, traitors to the Party who had their organizational relations restored without formal procedures) were engaging in corruption and embezzlement, colluding with landlords and reactionary elements to seize the fruits of victory from the peasants, forcibly borrowing grain from middle peasants, and undermining policies. The problems in the village also exposed serious bureaucratic work styles in the leadership of the county and district committees.

　　Huazhuang Village is a village of 170 households. Revolutionary power was established in 1943, and a Communist Party branch was established in 1946. The earliest Party members were Wang Luokai, Cui Luojin, Li Luocai, Liang Daxin, and two others. Except for Liang Daxin, who was a ruined landlord, the rest were middle peasants. In March 1947, after the enemy occupied Mancheng, Liang Daxin openly defected to the enemy. Wang Luokai and two others also defected and surrendered. Cui Luojin and Wang Luokai even served as the puppet chief and deputy chief of the bao. After the liberation of Baoding in November 1948, Fan Zhenxiang, the Organization Committee member of the district committee (who has been transferred to another county in this special district), had a vague stance and restored their Party relations carelessly without asking the county committee for instructions. Later, Wang Luokai also served as the village head. Cui Luojin and Li Luocai also became cadres. In the land reform in the spring of 1949, they also served as representatives of the peasant association. At this time, Wang Luokai and others colluded with peasant association representatives Liang Luozhi (non-Party member) and civil affairs committee member Li Junfeng (non-Party member) to engage in corruption and collude with landlords to undermine policies and seize the fruits of victory from the peasants. In April of this year, they illegally dismantled and sold many things that the peasants had already been allocated, such as Wang Lole's three mill sheds, Li Luoxin's two stone slab houses, Cui Zenglu's three factory sheds, and Cui Luoyou's fifteen trees. Without consulting the masses, they privately returned 13 shi of millet to three landlord households, including Liang Chizhang (6 shi of which was specifically for Liang Chizhang to marry his brother's wife). Two large carts and two mules of the peasant association were also seized by Wang Luokai, Li Junfeng, and other four cadres. From February to April, of the more than 60 shi of grain from the peasant association (part of which was converted from goods), apart from 2 shi 4 dou 7 ge given to 66 households of the masses, 8 dou 5 ge given to 20 households of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers, and 13 shi returned to landlords, most of the remaining 43 shi were embezzled by Wang Luokai, Liang Luozhi, Li Junfeng, and others.

　　In August of last year, they used the pretext of solving the difficulties of the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers to forcibly borrow 9 shi 7 dou of grain from 62 middle peasant households, including Liang Meifeng and Cui Luomao, which was divided up by Liang Luozhi and other 12 cadres. In April of this year, because deputy squad leader Li Luocai wanted to build a house, Wang Luokai, Liang Luozhi, Li Junfeng, and other five cadres forcibly borrowed 2 shi of grain from 13 middle peasant households including Liang Fangchun and gave it to him.

　　Wang Luokai and others often colluded with reactionary elements. For example, Liang Cainan, the reactionary leader of the village (former secretary of the puppet Mancheng County government), sneaked back to the village after the liberation of Baoding and was arrested and detained for hiding guns. Wang Luokai and others used the pretext of public opinion to write four joint guarantee letters with thirteen to fifteen or sixteen people's signatures (actually, most of them were fingerprints given by Li Junfeng and Wang Luokai), and went to the government four times to ask for his release. They also took white flour and meat to comfort Liang Cainan's wife, saying: "Don't worry, we will find a way to get him out. If you have any difficulties, just tell us, and we will solve them for you." When several returned personnel returned to the village, Wang Luokai and others said to them: "Don't register with the county, we will be responsible. Don't listen to the public security officer." As a result, Liang Chizhang and others did not register. In March of this year, when superstition and Taoist sects were banned, they said to the public security officer Li Jingxi at the meeting to ban the Yiguandao: "What does it matter if people are in the Yiguandao? That was during the Japanese occupation, why are you still bothering about it now? This is not a political issue; doesn't your family have any problems?" Their actions undermined the ban. In June of last year, the village Party branch secretary Cui Zenglu returned from training at the prefectural Party school. Because he inquired about their accounts, he was opposed by Wang Luokai and others. They reported to the district committee that Zenglu was not good. Liu Yuqing, the Propaganda Committee member of the district (who has been transferred to the provincial Party school for study), stopped Cui Zenglu's work without principle and without asking the facts. By April of this year, Cui Zenglu had not participated in organizational life for eleven months.

　　Wang Luokai and others have always been double-dealers in their work style, flattering superiors, and oppressing and excluding subordinates. They used embezzled money to win over district cadres to eat at their homes. Once, Li Junfeng tried to win over Fan Qing, a cadre from the district brigade, saying: "Do you want me to bring you anything? We go to Baoding constantly. It doesn't matter if we have money or not. We can't handle big things, but we have ways to handle small things." Fan Qing refused and criticized him. They were always eating and drinking in the village. Whoever treated them well would have their affairs handled easily. Li Junfeng also often colluded with people who liked to gamble to go to Liang Luozhi's house to ask for money, and no one dared to arrest them. They often boasted and made a show of power in front of the masses. Liang Luozhi said: "I have the power to appoint and dismiss. Whoever I say should be reformed, I will reform them. Whoever I say should be allocated something, I will allocate it to them. Whoever reports it upwards, we will figure out a way to deal with them. Anyway, the county and district cadres won't stay in this village for long, and we'll see them again after they leave!" The masses were so scared that no one dared to say a word.

　　These serious situations were not discovered until Wang Yuhua, Deputy Secretary of the County Committee, went to the village to lead cotton planting in late April. After research and discussion by the County Committee, it was believed that Wang Luokai and others colluded with reactionary elements, seized the fruits of victory from the peasants, undermined the Party's policies, made the peasants feel uneasy about production, and seriously damaged the Party's political influence among the masses. In order to maintain the policies, restore the Party's prestige, and compensate the losses of the masses, the County Committee decided to ask them to return all the fruits of victory seized from the peasants and the grain forcibly borrowed from the middle peasants. Those who could not return it at the time signed contracts and were given a deadline to return it. The County Committee also immediately convened a mass meeting in the village, announced their criminal behavior, reiterated various policies, and emphasized that in areas where land reform has been completed and land rights have been determined, individuals can freely dispose of all land and property, and the government will resolutely protect them, and no one may infringe upon them. It also made the masses deeply understand that forcibly borrowing grain from middle peasants is against policies and laws and will be punished by the government. Public security officers publicly took out the detention warrants from the county people's court and detained Liang Luozhi, Wang Luokai, Li Junfeng, and landlord Liang Chizhang, and four others, and brought them to the county to await trial. The County Committee also convened a meeting of Party members and village representatives of the village branch to review and criticize the mistakes of Wang Luokai and others, so that everyone could recognize the policies of the Party and the People's Government and clarify the direction of future work.

　　The mistakes of the cadres in Huazhuang Village are inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of the county and district committees in their leadership. First of all, the district committee's political stance was vague, and it casually restored the organizational relations of traitors to the Party without formal procedures, and stopped Cui Zenglu's organizational life. It neither asked for instructions beforehand nor reported it afterwards, which seriously violated organizational principles. At the same time, it did not study the situation of the village in history, did not analyze the problems from the essence of these cadres, and was deceived by the superficial achievements of the village, and actually regarded the village as a model village, so that their mistakes could develop unhindered and become increasingly serious. The district did not even know that the peasant association in the village still had some fruits of victory that had not been distributed in April of this year. Xing Yuzhu, the deputy district chief, also did not discover these problems when he often went to the village to work since February of this year. The main reason is that the work of the district committee is not in-depth, it only takes the cadre route, and does not contact the masses.

　　The county committee did not discover such serious problems in the village and the district committee's casual restoration of Party membership to traitors for a long time, which shows that there is also a serious bureaucratic work style in the leadership of the county committee. Although the county committee suspected when the Second District Committee reported Huazhuang as a model village in August of last year (because the village branch was infiltrated by the Kuomintang in 1945, and the leadership was controlled by the landlord, and the county committee decided to dissolve it), it only remained at the level of suspicion and did not send anyone to conduct an in-depth inspection. It was not until late April of this year when the county committee led cotton planting in the village that these situations were discovered. Now the county committee has instructed the Second District Committee to immediately deny the Party membership of Wang Luokai and other traitors who were restored without formal procedures, and has held a meeting to conduct a deep review of this issue. The materials of the village will be printed and distributed to various districts and agencies as learning materials for educating county and district cadres to go deep into their work and change their work styles.

　　官僚主义作风的教训
    中共满城县委会
    今年四月，河北省满城县委副书记王育华到二区花庄村领导种棉时，发现花庄村工作中存在着严重问题。该村部分党员干部（实际是未经正式手续而恢复组织关系的叛党分子）贪污腐化，勾结地主反动分子侵夺农民胜利果实，强借中农粮食，破坏政策。从该村的问题中又暴露出县委、区委领导上的严重的官僚主义作风。
    花庄村是个一百七十户的村庄。一九四三年建立革命政权，一九四六年建立了共产党支部。入党最早的是王洛开、崔洛金、李洛才、梁大辛等五人。其中除梁大辛一人是破落地主外，其余都是中农。一九四七年三月，敌人占领满城后，梁大辛公开投敌。王洛开等三人也随之叛变自首。崔洛金、王洛开并分任伪正副保长。一九四八年十一月保定解放后，该区区委组织委员范振祥（已调本专区其他县份工作）立场模糊，未向县委请示，即马马虎虎的恢复了他们的党的关系。后王洛开又任村长。崔洛金、李洛才也当了干部。一九四九年春土地改革中，他们又任农会代表。这时王洛开等即结合农会代表梁洛志（非党员）、民政委员李俊峰（非党员）贪污搞鬼，并勾结地主破坏政策，侵夺农民胜利果实。今年四月间，把农民王洛乐已分得的三间磨棚、李洛新的二间石板房、崔增禄的三间厂棚、崔洛有的十五棵树等许多东西，夺回来非法拆卖。他们不经群众便私自退给梁炽章等三户地主小米十三石（内有六石是专给梁炽章娶兄弟媳妇用的）。农会的两辆大车两个骡子也被王洛开、李俊峰等四个干部霸占了。从二月至四月的三个月中，农会的六十多石米（有一部分是东西折合的），除了分给六十六户群众两石四斗七、二十户烈、军、工属八斗半，及退还地主十三石外，其余四十三石大部被王洛开、梁洛志、李俊峰等贪污了。
    去年八月间他们曾以解决烈、军、工属的困难为名，向梁梅峰、崔洛茂等六十二户中农强借粮食九石七斗，由梁洛志等十二名干部分吃了。今年四月，因中队附李洛才要盖房，王洛开、梁洛志、李俊峰等五个干部又向梁房春等十三户中农强借粮食两石给了他。
    王洛开等三人经常与反动分子相勾结。如该村反动头子（前伪满城县政府秘书）梁彩南，保定解放后潜回村中，因匿藏枪枝而被逮捕扣押。王洛开等假借民意写了四个十三人至十五、六个人的联名保状（实际上大都是李俊峰、王洛开二人给打的手印），先后到政府四次要求保他。并拿着白面、肉去安慰梁彩南之妻说：“你心里放宽点，怎么我们也得想法把他保出来。你有什么困难提出来，我们给你解决。”该村几个还乡人员回家时，王洛开等对还乡人员说：“不要到县登记，有我们负责。别听公安员的话。”结果梁炽章等即未进行登记。今年三月取缔迷信道门时，他们在取缔一贯道的大会上，对公安员李景秀说：“人家在个一贯道有什么关系呢？那是日本时候的事，现在还管什么，这又不是政治问题；你们家中都没个毛病吗？”取缔工作受到他们的破坏。去年六月间，该村支部书记崔增禄从地委党校受训回来，因为查问了他们的账目，便遭到王洛开等的反对。他们向区委反映增禄不好。区宣委刘玉清（已调省委党校学习），不问青红皂白，就无原则地停止了崔增禄的工作。至今年四月崔增禄已有十一个月未过组织生活。
    王洛开等在作风上一贯是阳奉阴违，对上奉承，对下欺压排挤。他们曾用贪污的钱拉拢区干部到他家去吃饭。有一次李俊峰拉拢区大队部干部范青说：“你捎什么东西不？我们不断的到保定去。有钱没钱好说。大事办不了，小事咱们有办法。”范青拒绝并批评了他。他们在村一贯是吃吃喝喝，谁请了他们，谁的事情就好办。李俊峰还经常勾搭好赌博的人到梁洛志家去要钱，谁也不敢去抓。他们常在群众面前大吹大擂，装腔作势的抖威风。梁洛志说：“我有指定权、罢免权，我说改革谁就改革谁，说分给谁就分给谁。谁向上反映，就合计着点，反正县、区干部在这村住不长，走了再见！”吓的群众谁也不敢啃气。
    这些严重情况直到四月下旬县委副书记王育华到该村领导种棉工作时方被发觉。经县委会研究讨论，认为王洛开等勾结反动分子，侵夺农民胜利果实，破坏党的政策，使农民生产情绪不安，严重的损害了党在群众中的政治影响。为维护政策，挽回党的威信，并补偿群众损失，县委决定叫他们把侵夺农民的胜利果实和强借中农的粮食悉数退还。当时拿不出的订立契约，限期交还。县委并立即在该村召开了群众大会，公布了他们的犯罪行为，重申各种政策，着重说明：凡完成土地改革和确定地权地区，个人所有土地财产，可以自由处理，政府给以坚决保护，任何人不得侵犯。并使群众深刻了解强借中农的粮食是违背政策和法律的，将受到政府制裁。公安队员当众拿出县人民法院的拘票，把梁洛志、王洛开、李俊峰及地主梁炽章等四人拘提到县，听候审讯。县委又召开了该村支部党员大会和村代表会，对王洛开等的错误进行了检讨与批判，使大家认清了党和人民政府的政策，明确了今后的工作方向。
    花庄村干部的错误，与县委、区委领导上的官僚主义是分不开的。首先是区委政治立场模糊，不经正式手续，随便恢复叛党分子的组织关系，并停止崔增禄的组织生活，事先既不请示，事后又不报告，严重违反组织原则。同时不从历史上研究该村情况，不从这几个干部的本质上去分析问题，而被该村表面成绩所迷惑，竟把该村当做模范村，致使他们的错误得以无阻碍的向前发展并日益严重。该村今年四月农会尚保存一部胜利果实未给分配出去，区上也不知道。副区长邢玉柱今年二月以来，经常到该村工作也未发现这些问题。其主要原因是区委工作不深入，只走干部路线，而不联系群众。
    对该村如此严重的问题，及区委随便恢复叛党分子党籍的问题，很长时期县委竟未发觉，说明县委领导上同样存在着严重的官僚主义作风。去年八月二区区委汇报花庄为模范村时县委虽也发生怀疑（因为一九四五年该村支部混入国民党，领导权被地主所掌握，经县委决定而解散），但仅停留在怀疑上，并未派人去深入检查。直至今年四月下旬县委领导该村种棉时才发觉这些情况。现在县委已指示二区区委立即否认王洛开等叛党分子不经正式手续而恢复的党籍，并已开会对此问题作了深刻检讨。将该村材料印发各区各机关，作为教育县、区干部深入工作，转变作风的学习材料。
