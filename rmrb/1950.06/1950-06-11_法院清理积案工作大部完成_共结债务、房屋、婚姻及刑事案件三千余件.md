　　Court Largely Completes Task of Clearing Backlogged Cases
    More Than 3,000 Debt, Housing, Marriage and Criminal Cases Concluded
    [Kyoto City News Agency Dispatch] The Kyoto City People's Court, after a month of active effort to clear backlogged cases, has now largely completed this task. As of the 10th of this month, the total number of cases concluded has reached 3,019—including 1,925 civil cases within the court and in the various district trial groups involving debt, housing, marriage, industry and commerce, and labor-capital disputes; and 1,094 criminal cases involving spies, corruption, local tyrants, robbery, theft, narcotics, and financial crimes (note: according to the statistics of the 11th of last month, the total number of backlogged cases in the court was 3,521).
    The majority of the remaining backlogged cases that have not been concluded are due to the complexity of the cases, requiring detailed investigation, or preparation for further persuasive mediation. However, a small number of cases have been backlogged for too long by the court, and to date, the address of one or both parties has changed, making it impossible to summon them, resulting in temporary inability to conclude the cases.
    In the process of clearing the backlogged cases, the number of newly received cases has also been increasing daily. In the past month, the court has received more than 1,700 new cases. To date, the court has a total of more than 2,200 new and old cases that have not yet been processed. Therefore, the civil and criminal groups of the court have established external affairs tribunals to quickly handle new cases.
    The number of cases in the mediation sections of the district people's governments is also increasing daily, so the court has decided to transfer the backlogged cases in districts 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11 to the trial groups stationed in the respective districts for handling. The trial groups will first focus on mediation for these backlogged cases; if mediation fails, they will adjudicate according to the law. This can reduce the waste of time and energy for the parties involved, but in the future, new cases filed with the district people's governments for mediation will still be mediated by the district people's governments first. If mediation fails, they will be reported to the court for adjudication according to law, and will no longer be handled by the trial groups. (Chen Hong)

### 法院清理积案工作大部完成  共结债务、房屋、婚姻及刑事案件三千余件

　　法院清理积案工作大部完成
    共结债务、房屋、婚姻及刑事案件三千余件
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民法院清理积案工作，历经一个月的积极努力，现已大部完成。截至本月十日止，结案总数已达三千零十九件——包括院内及各区审判组民事的债务、房屋、婚姻、工商和劳资等案件一千九百二十五件，刑事的奸特、贪污、恶霸、抢劫、窃盗、烟毒和金融等案件一千零九十四件（按：据上月十一日统计法院全部积压案件为三千五百二十一件）。
    积压案件中未结部分大都是由于案情较为复杂，需要进行详细调查，或是准备再作说服调解的。但也有一小部分案件是由于法院积压过久，至今当事人双方或一方住址迁移，无法传到，以致暂时不能结案的。
    在清理积案的过程中，新收案件也日益增加，近一月来院内计收新案达一千七百余件，到目前止，法院总计有新旧案件二千二百余件尚未处理。因此，法院民、刑各组都已成立外勤庭，以便迅速处理新案。
    各区区公所调解科的案件也日益增多，故法院决定将一、二、四、八、九、十及十一各区的积案统移法院驻各该区审判组处理。审判组对该项积案首先是着重调解、如调解不成立时，即依法裁判。这样可以减少当事人对时间精力的浪费，但今后凡向区公所声请调解的新案，仍由该区区公所先行调解，如调解不成立，即转报法院依法裁判，不再由审判组处理。            （陈泓）
