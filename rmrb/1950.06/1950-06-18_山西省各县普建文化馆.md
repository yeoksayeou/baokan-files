Shanxi Province has established 77 People's Cultural Centers in 70 counties, one city, and two industrial and mining areas. In addition, cultural centers in Dingxiang and two other counties are being planned and established. The cultural centers have a total of 318 cadres. Except for the two cultural centers in Taiyuan City, which have 50 cadres, the remaining centers average only three to five people per center, and the fewest have only one person. The main tasks of the centers are: 1. Utilizing temple fairs to conduct production and hygiene propaganda; 2. Organizing literacy education and internal publicity activities for local people; 3. Being responsible for leading rural theater troupes. Among these, temple fair propaganda has the greatest impact, with exhibitions and slide shows as the means of publicity. Slide shows have become the best propaganda tool in rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, there are already 28 slide projectors in the province. They can combine with the current central work to plan and draw slides, which are most popular with the masses.

　　山西省各县普建文化馆
    山西省已有七十个县，一个市和两个工矿区分别建立了人民文化馆七十七所，另定襄等三县的文化馆正在筹备建立。各文化馆共有干部三一八人。其中除太原市两个文化馆有干部五十人外，其余各馆平均每馆只有三、五人，最少的只有一人。各馆的工作，主要是：一、利用庙会，进行生产、卫生宣传；二、组织当地群众识字教育和馆内宣传活动；三、负责领导农村剧团。其中以庙会宣传影响最大，宣传的方式有展览会和幻灯等。幻灯已成为农村中最好的一项宣传工具，据不完全统计，全省已有二十八部幻灯，能结合当前中心工作，有计划地绘制片子，最为群众欢迎。
