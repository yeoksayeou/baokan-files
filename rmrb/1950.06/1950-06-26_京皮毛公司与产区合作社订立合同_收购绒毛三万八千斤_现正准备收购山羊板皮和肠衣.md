　　Beijing Fur Company Signs Contract with Production Area Cooperatives to Purchase 38,000 Jin of Cashmere
    Now Preparing to Purchase Goatskins and Casings
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Branch of the North China Fur Company signed contracts with cooperatives in Zunhua, Yi County, Miyun, and Gu'an, four counties with relatively high cashmere production, in May, and has already purchased a total of 38,000 jin of cashmere. In order to take care of the financial and technical difficulties of the cooperatives, the company adopted a joint venture approach in the contract. The company advanced a considerable amount of funds and temporarily dispatched cadres to provide technical guidance to the cooperatives in each county. If the operation is profitable, the cooperative gets 60 percent; in case of losses, the cooperative only bears 40 percent. The contract is about to expire, and the cashmere season is coming to an end. The peak season for the production of goatskins and casings is approaching, and the company is now preparing to establish business relationships with cooperatives in each area to carry out purchases.
