Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 26th: Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement to reporters on the 23rd regarding the issue of the country's peaceful reunification, stating: Since liberation, all democratic political parties, social organizations, and the people of all Korea have made every effort to realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. In order to realize the decisions of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, to realize the Soviet government's proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea and for the Korean people to resolve the Korean issue themselves, to realize the Fatherland United Front's proposal regarding the peaceful reunification of the fatherland last June, and to realize the Fatherland United Front's renewed proposal on June 7th this year to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, the Korean people have resolutely carried out and are carrying out an unyielding struggle. However, all these efforts have been undermined by the Syngman Rhee gang's frantic suppression and persecution. Kim Tu-bong continued: The Republic's Supreme People's Assembly Standing Committee's proposal to the South Korean puppet "National Assembly" to discuss the issue of the fatherland's peaceful reunification has so far received no response from the South Korean puppet "National Assembly," once again proving that the South Korean "National Assembly" is completely an appendage of the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique and has no power to speak of. They are not only incapable of resolving the issue of the fatherland's peaceful reunification, but also have no intention of resolving it at all.

Kim Tu-bong also said: The Syngman Rhee gang, due to their towering crimes of national destruction and genocide, have become completely isolated among the people. In order to make a desperate struggle, they have exhausted all methods to undermine the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. Kim Tu-bong finally, while condemning the Syngman Rhee gang's repeated clamoring for a "northern expedition" and inciting civil war, said: They have been clamoring and preparing for a long time, attempting to take this adventurous action. But the Korean people will never allow it. The Korean people already have a strong People's Army, capable of defending the People's Republic and its constitution, as well as the achievements of various democratic reforms. At the same time, the entire Korean people, in order to defend the various freedoms and happy lives already achieved in the northern half of the Republic, and to extend these democratic reforms to the southern half, will jointly launch a comprehensive struggle.

　　朝鲜最高人民会议常委会委员长
    金枓奉发表谈话
    斥李承晚集团破坏和平统一  全朝鲜人民将展开全面斗争
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉于二十三日就国家和平统一问题，向记者发表谈话称：解放至今，全朝鲜各民主政党、社会团体及全国人民，为了实现祖国的和平统一，曾尽了一切努力。朝鲜人民为了实现莫斯科三外长会议的决定，为了实现苏联政府关于苏美两军同时自朝鲜撤退，并将朝鲜问题交由朝鲜人民自己解决的提议，为了实现去年六月祖国统一战线提出的关于祖国和平统一的方案，以及为了实现今年六月七日祖国统一战线再度促进祖国和平统一的提议，都曾坚决地进行了、并正在进行着不屈不挠的斗争。但是这一切努力，都给李承晚匪帮的疯狂镇压与迫害所破坏了。金枓奉继称：这次共和国最高人民会议常任委员会向南朝鲜伪“国会”提议商谈祖国和平统一问题，南朝鲜伪“国会”迄今毫无反应，又一次证明了南朝鲜的“国会”完全是李承晚反动集团的附属品，毫无权力可言。他们不仅无力解决祖国和平统一的问题，而且也根本不想解决。
    金枓奉又说：李承晚匪帮由于其亡国灭族的滔天罪行，已在人民中完全陷于孤立。为作垂死的挣扎，他们用尽了一切方法，来破坏祖国的和平统一。金枓奉最后在斥责李承晚匪帮屡次叫嚣“北伐”，挑拨内战的罪行时说：他们已经叫嚣和准备了很久，妄图作此冒险行动。但朝鲜人民是决不能容许的。朝鲜人民已经有了强大的人民军队，已能够保卫人民共和国和它的宪法，以及各种民主改革的成果。同时，全朝鲜人民为保卫共和国北半部已取得的各种自由权利和幸福生活，并把这一切民主改革推行到南半部去，将共同展开全面的斗争。
