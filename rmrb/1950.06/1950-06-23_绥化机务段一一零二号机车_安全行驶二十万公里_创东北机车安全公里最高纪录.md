Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th. Locomotive No. 1102, a freight locomotive of the Suihua Locomotive Depot of the Qiqihar Railway Administration, has traveled 200,000 kilometers safely without accidents in nearly two years and nine months from September 8, 1947, to May 28 this year, creating the highest record for safe locomotive travel mileage in the entire Northeast Railway. To celebrate this glorious achievement of the locomotive, Yu Guangsheng, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Railways in the Northeast, the Northeast Railway Political Department, the Northeast Regional Committee of the National Railway Trade Union, and the Northeast Railway Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League have all sent congratulatory telegrams.
　　The locomotive's success is due to the crew's implementation of the responsible spirit of the "Iron Ox," one of the national locomotive banners, and its persistent adherence to various systems. The crew of the locomotive is still maintaining its past spirit and confidently continuing to strive toward the goal of 300,000 kilometers of safe travel.
　　Previously, the highest safe mileage record for locomotives in the Northeast Railway was held by freight locomotive No. 294 of the Baichengzi Locomotive Depot, which had safely traveled 137,542.4 kilometers in eleven and a half months.

　　绥化机务段一一零二号机车
    安全行驶二十万公里
    创东北机车安全公里最高纪录
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】齐齐哈尔铁路管理局绥化机务段一一零二号货物机车，自一九四七年九月八日至今年五月二十八日为止，将近两年零九个月中未出事故，安全行驶二十万公里，创造了全东北铁路机车安全走行公里的最高纪录。为了庆祝该机车这一光辉成就，铁道部驻东北特派员余光生、东北铁路政治部、全国铁路工会东北地区委员会、新民主主义青年团东北铁路工作委员会，均已分别向其致电祝贺。
    该机车获得以上成绩，是由于乘务员贯彻了全国机车旗帜之一的“铁牛号”的负责精神，始终不懈地坚持执行各种制度。该机车的乘务员现仍本既往精神，有信心地向安全走行三十万公里的目标继续奋斗。
    按东北铁路机车走行安全公里最高者，过去为白城子机务段二九四号货物机车，该机车曾安全运行十一个半月，达十三万七千五百四十二点四公里。
