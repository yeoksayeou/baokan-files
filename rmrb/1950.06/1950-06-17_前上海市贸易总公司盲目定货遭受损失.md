　　Former Shanghai Trade Corporation Suffers Losses Due to Blind Ordering
    [Shanghai News] According to the Liberation Daily, during the warehouse material inventory work in Shanghai by the East China Branch of the National Warehouse Material Clearing Committee, it was discovered that the state-owned Shanghai Trade Corporation (now renamed Trade Trust Corporation) had blindly ordered goods from manufacturers after liberation, resulting in a large number of goods being piled up and unable to be sold, and also suffering bad debt losses.

    The Shanghai Trade Corporation neither investigated the sales of the goods nor understood the credit and capabilities of the ordering manufacturers. In October of last year, it ordered a total of 169,010 national flags from the Xinguang Underwear Factory and the Gulong Silk Weaving and Dyeing Factory. At that time, only 10,300 were sold, less than one-fifteenth. Up to now, half a year later, there are still 39,700 outstanding orders and undelivered goods; and a large number are piled up in warehouses, with as many as 119,010 not yet sold, accounting for more than four-fifths of the total goods delivered. The Gulong Silk Weaving and Dyeing Factory was unable to deliver the goods and became a bad debt. The total amount of trade funds tied up and even the owed funds, according to current estimates, has reached 1.9 billion yuan (excluding other storage rent, interest, etc.), seriously affecting the turnover of state funds.

　　前上海市贸易总公司盲目定货遭受损失
    【上海讯】据解放日报消息：全国仓库物资清理委员会华东分会，在上海的清仓工作中，发现解放后国营上海市贸易总公司（现改贸易信托公司）向厂商盲目定货，造成大批货物堆置无法销出，而且遭受了倒账损失。
    上海市贸易总公司既没有调查货品的销路，又没有了解定货厂商的信用和能力，于去年十月份曾向新光内衣厂、古龙丝织印染厂订制国旗共十六万九千零十面，当时仅出售一万零三百面，不及十五分之一。迄今半年中，尚有呆栈单及未缴货者达三万九千七百面；而大批堆存仓库，至今还未销售的，竟达十一万九千零十面，将及已缴货总数的五分之四以上。古龙丝织印染厂又因无力交货，而成了倒账。总计积压贸易资金及连拖欠的资金总数，照目前估价已有十九亿元之巨（其他栈租、利息等不包括在内），严重影响了国家资金的周转。
