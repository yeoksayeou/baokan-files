Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: TASS news: During the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan after the war, many new schools were established. This year, 34 million students are enrolled in the Soviet Union. The total number of school buildings is now nearly 200,000. There are 1.25 million teachers in rural schools. Thirty new normal colleges were established last year.

The children's education cause in all Soviet Union republics is developing in leaps and bounds. For example, the number of students in the Uzbek Republic has increased 65 times compared to before the revolution, Kyrgyzstan has increased 43 times, and Kazakhstan has increased 72 times.

In the past decade, the Soviet Union has published over 400 million children's books, and the best juvenile books have been printed in millions of copies. The largest children's publishing house in the Soviet Union, the State Publishing House for Children's Literature, published 37 million children's books last year alone. This year, on the anniversary of Pushkin's birth, three million copies of the poet's works were published.

Children's theaters are direct assistants to school and family education. In the first quarter of this year, more than 10 million young people went to the theater. Each time a new play is staged, it arouses enthusiastic responses from young audiences. They write theater reviews, create wall newspapers, and hold debates. After the play "The Young Pioneer" was performed, 70 schools in Moscow held debates on "The Honor of the Young Pioneers," and the theater received thousands of letters offering opinions and suggestions on the performance.

　　苏儿童文教飞跃发展
    今年已有三千四百万学童入学 
     十年来出版四亿余册儿童读物
    【新华社一日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联在战后五年计划时期，建立了许多新的学校。今年苏联有三千四百万学童入学。现在学校建筑物的总数已近二十万幢。乡村学校有一百二十五万教师。去年又成立了三十个新的师范学院。
    苏联各加盟共和国的儿童教育事业都在飞跃发展着。例如乌兹别克共和国的学生，较革命前增加了六十五倍，吉尔吉斯增加了四十三倍，哈萨克增加了七十二倍。
    苏联在过去十年中，出版了四亿余册儿童读物，最好的少年读物印行达数百万册。苏联最大的一家儿童出版局——儿童文学国家出版局，在去年一年中就出版了三千七百万册儿童读物。今年在普希金诞辰时，发行了三百万册诗人的著作。
    儿童剧院是学校与家庭教育的直接助手。今年第一季有一千多万少年到剧院观剧。每次上演新剧，都引起少年观众的热烈反应。他们写剧评，出壁报并开辩论会。“红领巾”一剧演出后，莫斯科有七十所学校举行了“少先队的荣誉”的辩论会，剧院收到了成千累万的信，提出对演出的意见和许多建议。
