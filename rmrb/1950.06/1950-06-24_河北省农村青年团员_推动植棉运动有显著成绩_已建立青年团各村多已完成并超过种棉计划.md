　　Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: New Democratic Youth League members in rural Hebei Province are actively promoting the planting of more cotton among young people and ordinary farmers, expanding the area under cotton cultivation. Many League members have received government awards for their outstanding achievements in promoting cotton planting. For example, in the Dingxian Special District, 231 League members received honorary awards from the government, and 149 League members received material awards from the government. According to incomplete statistics from 27 counties in seven special districts, including Dingxian, Cangxian, Baoding, Xingtai, Handan, Hengshui, and Shimen, villages that have established Youth League organizations have mostly completed or exceeded their cotton planting plans.

　　Since the Central People's Government issued the national grain and cotton production increase plan this spring, the Youth League committees at all levels in Hebei Province have, in accordance with the decisions of the Hebei Provincial CCP Committee and the Provincial People's Government, and the instructions issued by the Central Committee of the Youth League on March 19 regarding rural League members ensuring the implementation of grain and cotton production increases, generally convened meetings of Youth League cadres to mobilize branches and members to actively participate in the cotton planting campaign.

　　Most Youth League members in various localities studied production policies and cotton planting techniques. Some League branches in the Cangxian Special District experimented with the germination rate of cotton seeds; many League members in Anping County learned cotton planting experience from experienced farmers, such as how to prevent cotton wilt and how to cultivate seedlings in alkaline land. After studying, the League members conducted propaganda among the farmers. They used forms such as literacy classes, family meetings, radio stations, blackboards, street poetry, and clapper talk dramas to address farmers' concerns such as "it's labor-intensive and doesn't grow well," "planting more can't be eaten as food," and "lack of experience," explaining the price ratio of cotton to grain, cotton planting methods, and the reasons why planting more cotton can develop industry and reduce the need to buy foreign cotton, mobilizing the masses of farmers to plant cotton.

　　Youth League members in various places all started by mobilizing their own parents to plant more cotton through family meetings. Youth League members in Dingxian, Boye, Xinle, Lixian and other places in Dingxian Special District mobilized their parents to subscribe to cotton planting plans during the Spring Festival. For example, in the twelfth district of Dingxian, 500 League members from 36 League branches mobilized their families to subscribe to plans; in Xinle's three districts, 72 League members from 12 League branches, in addition to their own families subscribing to plans, also helped 12 farmers subscribe to cotton planting plans; Incomplete statistics from three counties in Cangxian Special District show that 653 League members mobilized their parents to subscribe to plans and increase the number of acres planted with cotton.

　　At the beginning of cotton planting, League members generally mobilized their families to plant first, taking the lead. Many League branches launched cotton planting competitions between League members and League members, groups and groups, villages and villages, thus setting off a local cotton planting craze. For example, in six counties and twenty-six districts of Cangxian Special District, 543 League members promoted 1,754 farmers to plant 1,769 mu of cotton; 33 League branches in five counties including Anguo persuaded 568 farmers to plant cotton, thus exceeding the cotton planting plan. In eight counties including Raoyang, Fuping, and Shenze, 95 League branches with a total of 1,117 League members planted a total of 6,072 mu of cotton, accounting for 84 percent of their total land area.

　　In addition to mobilizing farmers to plant cotton, Youth League members in various places also organized labor exchange and mobilized young women to participate in cotton planting. For example, in the Yubei District of Suning County, eight League branches, with 184 League members and 91 adult farmers, organized 19 mutual aid teams, completing the cotton planting plan ahead of schedule. Female Youth League members in counties such as Cangxian, Suning, and Jianguo used their active cotton planting actions to promote many young women to work in the fields.

　　河北省农村青年团员
    推动植棉运动有显著成绩
    已建立青年团各村多已完成并超过种棉计划
    【新华社二十一日讯】河北省农村中的新民主主义青年团员，积极在青年和一般农民中宣传鼓动多种棉花，扩大了植棉的面积。很多团员由于推广植棉运动有显著成绩，曾受到政府的奖励。如定县专区就有二百三十一名团员受到政府的名誉奖，一百四十九名团员得到了政府的物质奖。据定县、沧县、保定、邢台、邯郸、衡水、石门等七个专区二十七个县不完全的统计材料，凡是已建立青年团组织的村庄，大多完成或超过了植棉计划。
    自从今春中央人民政府发布全国粮棉增产计划以后，河北省青年团各级团委，即根据河北省中共党委和省人民政府的决定，以及团中央在三月十九日发出的关于农村团员保证贯彻粮棉增产的指示，普遍召开了青年团干部会议，动员支部和团员积极参加植棉运动。
    各地大部分青年团员学习了生产政策和种棉技术。沧县专区部分团支部试验棉种发芽率；安平县许多团员向老农学习种棉经验，如怎样防治棉疯秧、碱地怎样发苗等。经过学习后，团员就向农民进行宣传。他们利用民校、家庭会、广播台、黑板报、街头诗、快板话剧等形式，针对农民的“费工长不好”、“多种了不能当饭吃”和“没经验”等思想顾虑，讲解棉粮的比价、棉花的种植法以及多种棉花可发展工业而少买洋棉等道理，动员农民群众种棉。
    各地青年团员都通过家庭会议，首先动员自己的家长多种棉花。定县专区的定县、博野、新乐、蠡县等地青年团员，春节中就动员家长订种棉计划。如定县十二区有三十六个团支部的五百个团员，动员家里订了计划；新乐三个区十二个团支部的七十二个团员，除自己家庭订计划外，还帮助十二户农民订了种棉计划；沧县专区三个县的不完全统计，动员家长订计划、增加种棉亩数的团员有六百五十三名。
    在植棉开始时，一般团员都发动自己家里先种，起带头作用。许多团支部发动了团员与团员、小组与小组、村与村的植棉竞赛，因而掀起了当地植棉的热潮。如沧县专区六个县二十六个区中有五百四十三个团员推动农民一千七百五十四人种棉一千七百六十九亩；安国等五个县三十三个团支部，有六百二十二个团员说服五百六十八户农民种棉，因而超额完成了植棉计划。饶阳、阜平、深泽等八个县，有九十五个团支部共一千一百十七个团员，共种棉六千零七十二亩，占他们土地总数百分之八十四。
    各地青年团员除动员农民种棉以外，并组织了拨工互助和发动青年妇女参加种棉。如肃宁县寓北区八个团支部，有一百八十四个团员和九十一个成年农民组织了十九个互助组，提前完成植棉的计划。沧县、肃宁、建国等县的女青年团员用自己积极种棉的行动推动了不少青年妇女下地工作。
