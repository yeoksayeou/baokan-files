Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th: Shandong Province's 1950 spring river management and repair project is nearing completion. The completion of spring repairs on all rivers will realize this year's plan to protect 6.2 million mu of land that suffered from flooding last year from further water damage (the area of ​​land flooded in the province last year was over 12 million mu).

Among the Shandong Province's spring water conservancy projects, the second phase of the Yellow River's spring repair project has been fully completed by the end of May, except for the dike works within Kenli County and Jinan City. The project is quite strong and is expected to be able to defend against the highest flood level of 1949. In addition, the Xuanhui River, Tuhai River, Shuangshan River, Ziyang River, Bailang River, Si River, Wen River, and other rivers within Shandong that are prone to flooding have all undergone spring repairs. The first phase of the Daishu River project, which will not yield benefits this year, has also completed its original plan. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 703,762 workers were mobilized for spring repairs throughout the province, completing over 17 million cubic meters of earthwork and 800,000 cubic meters of stonework. Government allocations for project costs, including just work rations, amounted to over 45 million.

Some shortcomings occurred during the project's progress in various places: the quality of some projects was rough, and the spirit of "using work as relief" was not well implemented in individual areas, turning into a simple distribution of relief grain for disaster relief. Although these shortcomings were corrected in a timely manner, they still affected the progress of many projects. At the provincial water conservancy conference held on the 29th of last month by the Provincial Department of Industry and the Water Conservancy Bureau, the above shortcomings were reviewed.

Now the Shandong Provincial People's Government is planning to lead a concentrated effort to complete the unfinished spring repair projects, while establishing sound flood prevention agencies, consolidating flood prevention organizations along the rivers, preparing flood prevention materials, and preparing to meet the upcoming summer flood season.

　　山东春季治河接近结束
    黄河二期春修工程强固     
    足可防御去年最高洪水位袭击
    【新华社济南十日电】山东全省一九五○年春季的治河春修工程已近结束。各河春修的完成，即可实现今年使去年曾遭水灾的田地六百二十万亩免除水患的计划（去年全省被淹田地面积为一千二百余万亩）。
    山东省水利春修工程中，黄河的第二期春修工程除垦利县、济南市境内的堤工外已于五月底全部完工。工程相当强固，预计足可防御一九四九年最高洪水位的袭击。此外，山东境内易于泛滥成灾的宣惠河、徒骇河、双山河、淄阳河、白浪河、泗河、汶河等河流均经春修。今年还不能得到收益的第一期导沭工程也已完成了原订计划。根据不完全统计，全省春修共动员民工七十万三千七百六十二人，作土方一千七百余万公方和石方八十万公方。政府拨发的工程费仅工粮一项即达四千五百余万。
    各地工程进行中曾发生一些缺点：部分工程质量粗糙，个别地区未能很好贯彻以工代赈的精神，变成单纯发赈粮救灾。这些缺点虽经及时纠正，仍影响了许多工程的进展。在上月二十九日省实业厅和水利局召开的全省水利会议上，曾就上项缺点加以检讨。
    现山东省人民政府正计划领导突击完成未完工的春修工程，同时建立健全的防汛机构，整顿沿河防汛组织，筹备防汛料物，准备迎接即将到来的夏汛。
