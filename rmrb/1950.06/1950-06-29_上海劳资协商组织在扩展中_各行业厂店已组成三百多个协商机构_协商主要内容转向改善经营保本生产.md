Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Labor-management consultation meeting organizations in Shanghai's private enterprises are expanding from various industries to factories and shops throughout the city. As of the 20th of this month, 301 labor-management consultation organizations have been registered or are in the process of registering with the Municipal Labor Bureau. Among them, 58 are organized by industry, and 243 are organized by factory or shop. This represents significant progress compared to April, when only three factories citywide had labor-management consultation organizations. In particular, since May, the main content of labor-management consultations has shifted from disputes over layoffs and dismissals and general industry-wide issues to discussing how to improve factory and shop operations and ensure break-even production. This positive trend is mainly due to the in-depth communication of the resolutions of the Third People's Representative Conference, which strengthened the confidence of some industrialists and businessmen in overcoming current difficulties. At the same time, the government has strengthened its work in entrusting processing and ordering goods from private enterprises, which has not only turned around the production difficulties of private enterprises but also prompted them to demand improved operations to achieve break-even production. Many factories have made significant achievements in improving production after establishing labor-management consultation organizations. For example, after labor and management at the Xiechang Sewing Machine Factory consulted and signed a production contract, daily sewing machine head production increased from 250 to 500 units, doubling the output. After consultation at the Hongda Rubber Factory, workers' enthusiasm for production increased, and labor discipline improved, resulting in improved product quality. Previously, two pairs of substandard shoes were found in every 100 pairs produced by the factory; now, only one pair is found in every 200 pairs. This proves that labor-management consultation can not only resolve disputes between labor and management but also play a significant role in promoting production.
    Establishing labor-management consultation meetings is a new task. Initially, due to a lack of experience, the Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau was distressed by the large number of enterprises and the limited number of cadres, which made it impossible to provide individual guidance. Later, the bureau adopted a collective reporting method to promote experience, convening座谈会 with labor and management representatives from established consultation organizations nine times. It then held a typical reporting conference with more than 2,000 labor and management representatives from various industries and held 18 lecture meetings on the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings, with approximately 8,400 labor and management representatives attending. In addition, the Municipal Labor Bureau also dispatched cadres to participate in consultation meetings in key factories to provide specific assistance and, after the establishment of consultation meetings in several industries, further organized them at the grassroots level of factories and shops to enable the consultation meetings of industries and factories/shops to cooperate with each other in their work. The Municipal Labor Bureau also used newspapers and radio stations to introduce experiences in a timely manner. After adopting these methods, the work of establishing labor-management consultation meetings gradually unfolded.
    Several Main Problems Encountered in the Process of Establishing Labor-Management Consultation Meetings
    The following were some of the main problems encountered in the process of establishing labor-management consultation meetings in Shanghai: (1) Views on labor-management consultation meetings and issues for consultation: In the beginning, there were various views on the matter. Many people regarded it as a "small labor bureau," mainly for resolving labor-management disputes. Some enterprises with good labor-management relations believed, "We have no labor disputes; there is no need to hold consultation meetings." Some workers feared that the capitalists would use consultation meetings to reduce wages and were therefore concerned about establishing labor-management consultation meetings. Some capitalists were afraid that the labor side would make demands for improved treatment and interfere in enterprise operations and management, and they also held a negative attitude towards the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings. Shanghai's experience over the past two months has proven that in order to dispel these concerns, it is first necessary to carry out in-depth persuasive education work. Moreover, it is necessary to clearly state in the consultations that the main task of the consultation meeting is to focus on production and to discuss how to improve production in order to overcome current difficulties. (2) The relationship between industry-wide and factory/shop-level labor-management consultation meetings: The wool textile industry once regarded the industry-wide consultation meeting as a general consultation meeting, establishing branch meetings in each factory, creating a hierarchical leadership relationship. This hindered each factory from effectively solving its own problems. It is now generally believed that industry-wide labor-management consultation meetings mainly consult on the common problems of the industry and assist each factory in establishing and consolidating consultation organizations, cooperating with each other in their work. As for the issues related to each factory in the consultation resolutions, each factory can implement them. (3) The number of labor and management representatives: In some smaller and solely-owned factories, it is difficult for the capitalists to select the same number of representatives as the labor side. Some capitalists were concerned about this, thinking that having fewer people would be disadvantageous, so they appointed engineers and other senior staff as representatives of the capitalist side. This approach is inappropriate. The experience of the Huanqiu Iron Factory shows that as long as both sides are committed to the goal of doing a good job in production and are sincere with each other on an equal basis, agreements can be reached even if the number of representatives from the labor and management sides is not exactly the same. In addition, both sides' representatives should strive for democratic elections and promote the spirit of self-criticism. Both sides should conduct consultations calmly and peacefully with an attitude of mutual trust, frankness, sincerity, and mutual consideration. When there are shortcomings, self-criticism should be carried out. This will eliminate the other party's doubts and concerns, thereby resolving the issues being consulted. For example, at the beginning of the consultations at the Huanqiu Iron Factory, labor and management each held their own opinions. Later, the consultations progressed because they demonstrated a spirit of self-criticism. (4) Some consultation organizations have become mere formalities. The wool textile industry consultation meeting has established guidance, production, and investigation teams, which have played a certain role in helping consultation to solve problems. However, some factory consultation organizations have set up these same bodies without regard to their own specific situations, even including welfare teams, which has led to the phenomenon of replacing the work of trade unions and the administrative work of capitalist factories. These problems are being addressed.

　　上海劳资协商组织在扩展中
    各行业厂店已组成三百多个协商机构
    协商主要内容转向改善经营保本生产
    【新华社二十七日讯】上海市私营企业的劳资协商会议组织，正由各行业向全市工厂、商店中扩展。截止本月二十日，已向市劳动局登记备案及正在准备登记备案的劳资协商机构，已有三百零一个。其中以行业为单位组成的五十八个，以厂、店为单位组成的二百四十三个。目前情况与四月份全市只有三个工厂有劳资协商机构的情况对比，显然已有很大进展。特别是自五月份起，劳资协商的主要内容已由疏散、解雇等争议及同业性的一般问题，转向协商如何使厂、店改善经营、保本生产的问题。这一良好的趋势，主要是由于深入传达了第三次各界人民代表会议决议，加强了某些工商业家克服目前困难的信心。同时政府加强了对私营企业的委托加工和定货的工作，这一方面使私营企业的生产困难获得转机，另一方面也促使他们要求改善经营，以达保本生产。许多工厂在建立劳资协商机构后，在改进生产方面已有不少成绩。如协昌缝纫机厂，劳资经过协商，签订生产合同后，每日车头生产即由二百五十只增至五百只，产量提高了一倍。宏大橡胶厂经协商后，工人生产情绪提高，劳动纪律改进，因而使产品质量已有改善。该厂所产球鞋，以前一百双中有两双副号（次货），现在二百双中只有一双副号。这证明劳资协商不仅能解决劳资双方发生的争议，而且在推动生产上，能起很大的作用。
    建立劳资协商会议的工作是新的工作。开始时，由于缺乏经验，上海市劳动局曾因企业单位繁多，干部太少，无法分别去领导而感到苦恼。以后该局乃采用了集体汇报推广经验的领导方法，先后九次召集已建立协商机构的劳资代表开座谈会，进而召开有各业劳资代表二千余人参加的典型报告大会，又举行了十八次演讲会，讲述建立劳资协商会议问题，劳资双方听讲的约有八千四百余人。另外市劳动局又调派干部有重点地参加各厂协商会议，加以具体协助，并在若干同业的协商会议建立后，进而深入到各厂、店基层单位中去组织，使同业与厂、店的协商会议在工作中能互相配合。市劳动局还运用报纸、广播电台及时介绍经验。采取了这些方法以后，建立劳资协商会议的工作就逐渐展开。
  建立劳资协商会议过程中曾经遇到的几个主要问题
    上海市劳资协商会议建立的过程中，曾经遇到以下几个主要问题：（一）对于劳资协商会议的看法和协商内容问题：在开始时，各方曾有过各种不同的看法，许多人把它看做“小劳动局”，主要只是解决劳资间的争议。有些劳资关系较好的企业，劳资双方都认为：“我们没有劳资纠纷，协商会议不必开。”有些工人怕资方利用协商会议进行减薪，因而对建立劳资协商会议存有顾虑。部分资方则害怕劳方提出改善待遇的要求，和干涉企业经营和管理，也对建立劳资协商会议抱消极态度。两个月来，上海市的经验证明，要解除这些顾虑，首先就要进行深入的说服教育工作。并且要在协商中明确说明协商会议的主要任务是面向生产，协商如何改善生产以克服目前困难。（二）关于同业性的和厂、店的劳资协商会议之间的关系问题：毛纺业曾将同业协商会议作为总的协商会，在各厂建立分会，成为上下级领导关系。这样就妨碍了各厂有效地解决本身问题。目前一般认为，同业劳资协商会议，主要是协商本业的共同问题，同时并协助各厂建立和巩固协商机构，彼此间在工作上互相配合。至于协商决议中有关各厂的问题，各厂可以执行。（三）劳资双方代表等数的问题。某些规模较小和独资经营的工厂，资方很难选出与劳方同等数量的代表。有些资方为此存有顾虑，以为人数少会吃亏，就指定工程师等高级职员作资方代表。这种作法是不妥当的。寰球铁工厂的经验说明，只要双方都本着作好生产的目的，并在平等的基础上真诚相见，即使劳资双方代表数目不完全相等，也同样可以获得协议。此外，双方代表要尽量做到民主选举，同时要发扬自我批评的精神。双方以互相信任、坦白诚恳和互相照顾的态度，平心静气地进行协商，有缺点时，进行自我批评。这样才能清除对方的怀疑和顾虑，从而使协商的问题获得解决。如寰球铁工厂在开始协商时，劳资双方各持成见。后来由于发挥了自我批评的精神，才使协商得到了进展。（四）有些协商机构曾流于形式。毛纺业协商会议曾设立了辅导、生产、调查等小组，在帮助协商解决问题中起了一定作用。但有些工厂的协商机构不根据本厂的具体情况，照样设立，甚至设有福利组等，形成了代替工会工作和资方厂务行政工作的现象。这些问题，正在改进中。
