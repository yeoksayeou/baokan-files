　　American Soldiers in Japan
    Klifzov
    American propaganda tries its best to promote the idea that American troops, from MacArthur down to the soldiers and sailors, have brought freedom to Japan, and that every member of the occupying forces is a guide to high culture and democracy. However, the series of events that have occurred in Japan over the years proves that this is not the case at all.
    The facts of the five years since Japan's surrender indicate that the behavior of the American army in Japan is far from consistent with the lying and exaggerated propaganda of the American reactionaries in MacArthur's headquarters.
    What the Americans have done in Japan is exactly what the most ferocious colonizers would do, treating the Japanese as if they were the lowest race.
    There is a saying popular among the people of southern Korea: "The souls of American soldiers are dirty." This saying is also completely descriptive of the American soldiers and sailors currently stationed in Japan. The main thoughts of the soldiers of MacArthur's army are nothing more than materially ensuring their own comfort as much as possible: getting rich, living comfortably, and enjoying themselves. And the officers are not far from the soldiers. The only difference is that officers have more opportunities to realize their wishes.
    The appearance of American soldiers always causes fear among Japanese residents. Japanese people whose homes are close to American troops are so afraid that they detour home every dusk to avoid encountering American soldiers.
    American soldiers can kill Japanese people for no reason, rob them of their money and other valuables, rape their wives in front of their husbands, or rape their daughters in front of their parents.
    News about the scandals of Americans is only published in the newspapers of the American occupation authorities after it has been spread and with the permission of MacArthur's headquarters. These reports often point out that the perpetrators have been "severely" punished by the command. However, even those news items that have been published in the newspapers are enough to judge the behavior of American soldiers and their attitude towards the Japanese people. Let's mention a few similar newspaper reports. The "Stars and Stripes" reported that in Kobe, a soldier named Brojukitsky, standing on duty next to a cargo ship, began to insult Japanese workers unloading goods on the ship, and later used a machine gun to shoot and kill one of them. The same newspaper also said that three American soldiers stationed on Okinawa kidnapped a Japanese woman, then raped her and beat her husband, who tried to resist, half to death.
    The dozens of incidents of American soldiers terrorizing, killing, and plundering Japanese people that happen every day are proof of the arrogance and rudeness of the soldiers, sailors, and officers of the American occupation army towards Japanese residents. These phenomena have reached such a widespread extent in Japan that even the American occupation army's censorship organs have had to allow a large number of reports about the looting, rape, and seizure of property by American occupation army soldiers to be revealed in their own and Japan's reactionary newspapers month after month. According to the "Stars and Stripes": "Five drunken American soldiers drove a car through a crowd of Japanese people, seriously injuring eleven. Afterwards, they beat two coachmen to death. Continuing their journey along the avenue, they ran over a Japanese man walking on the road, and one of the soldiers jumped out of the car and beat the injured Japanese man to death with a wooden stick."
    The same newspaper reported: "An American soldier entered a small Japanese village before dawn, killing four people and injuring two. The dead included a woman, a man, and two children—one eight years old and one nine years old."
    American soldiers do not take the formal representatives of the Japanese press seriously at all. For example, after several incidents of looting and serious injury to Japanese people occurred within a few days, the president of the "Hokkaido News" published these news items in his own newspaper. The news stated that the "large footprints" left by the criminals in the snow were enough to show the sins committed by the American soldiers. The newspaper president received a severe warning for this report.
    All reports attempt to show the Japanese people that the American occupation authorities "severely punish" those who insult and harm the Japanese people.
    In fact, MacArthur's headquarters publishes such news while not punishing them.
    The "Stars and Stripes" reported that soldiers of the Fourteenth Reserve Battalion massacred a Japanese person with the purpose of looting. The newspaper also wrote that in Tama County near Tokyo, an American soldier massacred an entire family: father, mother, and two girls—one seven years old and one nine years old. At the time, a forty-nine-year-old woman and an eleven-year-old child were also injured. The same newspaper published a news item: A soldier named Roswell destroyed the door of a Japanese store and rushed in, but was discovered by two Japanese girls. He shot and killed one of the girls.
    A Japanese politician recounted the situation in Sapporo City—the only city in Hokkaido where American troops are stationed. Perhaps due to the special strategic conditions and other conditions in the area, these troops are allowed to act freely. These politicians said: "Taking advantage of this, in January alone, American military police shot and killed twenty-one Japanese people on the streets of the city for no reason."
    Another politician declared: As a result of armed looting carried out by American soldiers in Sapporo City, fifty-two Japanese people were killed within a few days. "Hokkaido News" reported that the criminals were several burly men. This implied Americans. The president received a severe warning for this news item.
    American occupation army soldiers, sailors, and officers returning to the United States are usually fully loaded with a large number of "souvenirs" looted in Japan. The sensational incident of Colonel Miles, who looted valuables worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in Japan, is well known.
    The soldiers of MacArthur's occupation army not only loot Japanese residents, but also loot American army warehouses. According to the "Stars and Stripes": "A group of soldiers in the 'Johnson' Airport unit carried out an armed looting of the laundry, where American military uniforms were stored. On the eve of this looting, the above-mentioned soldiers had stolen five automatic rifles, two pistols, and two hundred bullets from the warehouse."
    The rape of Japanese girls by American soldiers and officers has become a mass characteristic of the American army.
    The "Stars and Stripes" reported that in the central area of Tokyo, near the editorial department of the "Asahi Shimbun," in front of a horrified and dumbfounded public, two American soldiers of the First Cavalry Division threw a Japanese girl from the Fukiyabashi Bridge into the surrounding canal below the bridge, simply because she refused to spend the night with them. The same newspaper published a communication about an American soldier, Kang A Xun, raping a twelve-year-old Japanese girl. That newspaper also published news of a soldier in the service team of MacArthur's headquarters raping a twelve-year-old girl.
    The Americans stationed in Japan behave arrogantly, treating the Japanese as slaves. In Tokyo and other cities in Japan, it is often seen that groups of American soldiers swagger and swindle on the streets and in shops. They freely drive rickshaws and wander in bars, theaters, cinemas, and other public places. The soldiers' arrogance is no different from that of hooligans. In theaters and cinemas, American soldiers usually walk around during screenings, whistling, saying vulgar things, and sometimes even cursing. If any Japanese person in the audience dares to remind them to maintain order and keep quiet, they will drag the Japanese person into the street and start beating him.
    But American soldiers not only want to live a carefree life, they believe that every soldier and every officer should make a lot of money for themselves while stationed in Japan. Therefore, they rob the Japanese people, who have already been impoverished by the Japanese warlords. No Japanese person dares to leave home without locking their house tightly. Looting has become a favorite occupation of American soldiers.
    "Mainichi Shimbun" reported: "It is a well-known fact that six American soldiers admitted that they broke into the Thai Embassy in Tokyo late on Friday night, forced the embassy staff to open the vault under the threat of weapons, and robbed 245,000 yen."
    Soldiers, officers, and even generals of the American occupation army take advantage of the difficulty in Japan's food supply to engage in speculative trading and obtain huge profits in speculative trading. According to statistics, 30% of all personnel in MacArthur's army are systematically engaged in speculative trading. Newspapers report daily on news of Japanese people being punished for selling American military supplies and military food. However, Japanese newspapers are prohibited from publishing news that these supplies were bought from American soldiers.
    The speculative trading done by American soldiers is truly all-encompassing: from cheap cigarettes to cars and other military supplies, everything is available. Even American newspapers cannot hide this, and they report many facts about soldiers, sailors, and officers of the occupying forces doing speculative trading. These cunning behaviors on the black market are grandly called "making some supplementary income." And this "supplementary" income often reaches tens of thousands of yen. All of this is considered legitimate, so American soldiers are not punished for it, unless "large-scale speculative business reaches the pinnacle" and the income of those American enlisted men who are skilled in making money "reaches hundreds of thousands of yen," then they will be punished.
    There is simply no end to the events that depict the rudeness of Americans and their inhuman treatment of Japanese residents. However, even the above facts are enough to refute those noble aspirations that the Americans seemed to have when they came to Japan. Even the most ordinary Japanese person fully understands that the Americans do not care about the interests of the Japanese people or improving their living conditions.
    The soldiers and officers of the so-called "civilized" army, who consider themselves representatives of the "most democratic," "free," and "cultural" country, have behaved in Japan like murderers, rapists, and robbers.
    This is the "moral" face of American soldiers and officers.
    Looting, raping women and girls, massacring, hooliganism, treating the people like their own slaves—this is all that American army soldiers and officers have brought to the people of Asian countries.

　　美国军人在日本
    克里夫佐夫
    美国的宣传竭力鼓吹，说美军上自麦克阿瑟下至美军士兵和水手，都给日本带来了自由，又说占领军中每一个人都是崇高文化和民主主义的引路人。可是几年以来，在日本所发生的一系列的事件证实完全不是这么一回事。
    日本投降后五年来的事实，指出了美国军队在日本的行为，远不符合麦克阿瑟总部的美国反动分子们的撒谎和夸大的宣传。
    美国人在日本的所作所为完全是最凶悍的殖民者，他们对待日本人像对待最下等的种族似的。
    在朝鲜南部人民中流行这样的话：“美国士兵的灵魂是肮脏的”。这句话也完完全全是现在驻扎日本的美国兵士和水手的写照。麦克阿瑟军队的士兵们的主要思想不外乎是在物质上保证自己尽可能舒服：发财致富，生活舒适，逍遥自在。而军官们也与士兵相去不远。不同的地方只是在于：军官有更多的可能实现自己愿望而已。
    美国士兵的出现总是引起日本居民的恐惧。凡是其住宅靠近美国部队的日本人都恐惧到这样的程度：每当黄昏都是绕道回家，避免碰见美国士兵。
    美国士兵没有任何理由就可以杀死日本人，抢走他的钱及别的值钱的东西，当着丈夫的面强奸妻子或者当着父母的面强奸女儿。
    关于美国人的丑行的消息，只有已被传开并在得到麦克阿瑟总部的准许之后，才会刊登在美国占领当局的报刊上。在这些消息上往往指出：犯罪者已经受到指挥部“严厉”处分云云。可是甚至就是那些已经为报刊登载过的消息，已足够判断美国军人的行为及其对日本人的态度了。我们来说几件类似的报纸消息吧。“星条报”报道称：在神户有一个叫做布罗朱次基的士兵，站在货船旁的岗位上，开始辱骂在船上卸货的日本工人，后来用马枪扫射，杀死其中一人。同报又称：三个驻冲绳岛的美兵掳到一个日本女人之后，就把她强奸了，而把她的企图反抗的丈夫打得半死。
    每天所发生的美国军人恐吓、屠杀、掠夺日本人的几十件事件，正是美国占领军的士兵、水手和军官对待日本居民的傲慢和粗野态度的确证。这些现象在日本已经达到了这样广泛的程度，甚至就是美国占领军新闻检查机关，也不得不让一月复一月的、大量的关于美国占领军军人掠夺日本人、强奸和劫取财物的消息，透露在自己的和日本的反动报刊的篇幅上。据“星条报”载称：“五个喝醉了酒的美国兵乘了一辆汽车冲过一群日本人，使十一人受重伤。之后他们又打死两名汽车夫。在沿着大道继续其行程时，他们又以汽车轧伤了一个在这条路上行走的日本人，其中一个士兵从汽车上跳出来，用木棍把这个受伤的日本人打死。”
    同报消息：“一个美兵于拂晓前走进一个日本小乡村，杀死四人并打伤两人。被杀者包括：一个女人、一个男人和两个儿童——一为八岁，一为九岁。”
    美国军人一点也不把日本报界的正式代表看在眼里，比如在几天之内发生了若干掠夺和重伤日本人的事件之后，“北海道新闻”报的社长便在他主编的报纸上登载了这些消息。该项消息叙述说，罪犯们在雪地上留下的“很大的痕迹”，即足以说明美国军人所犯的罪孽。该报社长因为这个报道受到了严厉的警告。
    一切报道都企图向日本人民表明：美国占领当局“严惩”那些侮辱与损害日本人的人们。
    而事实上麦克阿瑟总部却一面刊登类似这样的消息，一面并不惩处他们。
    “星条报”报道了第十四预备营的士兵怀着掠夺的目的屠杀了一个日本人。该报也写道：在东京附近多摩郡里，一个美国兵屠杀了一全家人：父亲、母亲和两个女孩——一个七岁，一个九岁。当时并打伤了一个四十九岁的女人和一个十一岁的小孩。同一报纸又发表了一个消息：士兵罗赫威尔打毁了日本商店的门，直撞进去，可是却被两个日本少女发现了。他便开枪打死了其中一个少女。
    一位日本的政治家讲述了札幌市——是在北海道驻扎了美军的唯一的城市——的情形。也许是由于该区特殊的战略条件和其他条件，这些军队被允许自由行动。这些政治家说：“就利用这一点，仅在今年一月份内，美国宪兵便无缘无故地在该城当街枪杀了二十一名日本人。”
    另一位政治家宣称：由于美国军人，在札幌城所进行的武装掠夺的结果，几天之内被杀害的日本人已达五十二人。“北海道新闻”报道称：罪犯——是几个身材魁梧的人。这暗示着美国人。社长因为该项新闻受到严厉警告。
    回美国去的美国占领军中的士兵、海员和军官们，照例是满载了在日本掠夺而来的大量的“纪念物”。那位在日本掠夺了价值数十万美元的贵重东西的迈列上校的轰动一时的事件，是大家都知道的。
    麦克阿瑟占领军的军人们不单是掠夺日本居民，而且也掠夺美军的仓库。据“星条报”报道称：“约翰逊”飞机场部队中一群士兵进行了对洗衣处的武装掠夺，那儿储藏着美军制服。在这次掠夺的前夕，上述士兵曾在仓库里偷窃了五支自动枪、两支手枪和二百发子弹。
    美国士兵和军官强奸日本姑娘成了美军的群众性的特点。
    “星条报”报道称：在东京的中心区，“朝日新闻”报编辑部附近，当着被警惶得目瞪口呆的公众的眼前，第一骑兵师团的两个美国兵把一个日本姑娘从敷寄屋桥上扔到桥下的环城运河里，只不过是因为她拒绝了陪他们过夜。同一报纸刊登了美兵康阿逊强奸十二岁日本女孩的通讯。那张报上也刊登了在麦克阿瑟总部勤务队的一个士兵强奸了一个十二岁女孩的消息。
    驻日本的美国人，行为傲慢，对待日本人犹如对待奴隶。在东京以及在日本其他城市中时常可以看见：一群一群的美兵在街头上、在商店里、招摇撞骗。他们逍遥自在地驱策着人力车，徘徊在酒吧、戏院、电影院以及其他公共场所。士兵们的傲慢真与流氓无异。在剧院和电影院里，美国军人照例是在开映时间内东奔西走，吹口哨，说下流话，而有时甚至漫骂一通。如果在座的任何一个日本人敢于提醒他们遵守秩序，保持清静，那么他们便会把这个日本人拖到街上，开始揍他。
    可是美国军人不单是要过逍遥自在的生活，他们认为：每一个士兵和每一个军官，驻扎在日本时都应为自己弄一大笔钱。所以他们抢劫着已被日本军阀掠夺得穷苦不堪了的日本人民。无论那个日本人在离开家时都不敢不把房屋锁得牢牢的。掠夺已成了美国军人所喜爱的职业。
    “每日新闻”报道称：“这是大家都晓得的事：六个美国兵承认了他们曾于星期五深夜突入了驻东京的泰国大使馆，在武器的恐吓之下逼迫大使馆的工作人员打开金库，抢走了二十四万五千日元。”
    美国占领军的士兵、军官、甚至将军，都利用着日本粮食供给的困难，从事投机买卖，并在投机买卖中获取极大的利润。据统计，麦克阿瑟的军队的全部人员中，百分之三十都在有系统地从事投机买卖。报纸上每天都在报道因为贩卖美国军用物资和军粮而受到惩罚的日本人的消息。可是日本报纸却被禁止登载这些物资是从美国军人那里买来的消息。
    美国军人所做的投机买卖真是无所不包：自廉价的香烟到汽车和其他军用物资，样样具备。甚至美国报纸也不能隐藏这个了，它报道了占领军士兵、水手和军官们做投机买卖的许多事实。这些黑市上的奸狡行为被冠冕堂皇地称做“弄点补充收入”。而且这种“补充”收入往往达到好几万日元。这一切是被认为正当的，所以美军的军人没有因此受到任何处罚，除非是“大规模的投机生意到达了登峰造极的程度”，那些精于发财术的美国丘八的收入，要“到达数十万日元”时才会受到惩办。
    描绘美国人的无礼行为及其对日本居民的非人态度的特色的一切事件，简直是罄竹难书。可是就是上述事实也已够确切地反驳那些美国人到日本来时所抱的好像是高贵的志向。甚至是一个最普通的日本人都完全明白了：美国人完全不想到日本人民的利益和改善日本人民的生活条件。
    所谓“文明”军队的士兵和军官们，自以为是“最高度民主”、“自由”、“文化”的国家的代表们，在日本的所作所为正如杀人犯、强奸者和强盗一样。
    这就是美国士兵和军官的“道德”面貌。
    掳掠、奸淫妇女和姑娘、屠杀、流氓行为，像对待自己的奴隶一样对待老百姓——这就是美军士兵和军官给亚洲各国人民所带来的一切。
