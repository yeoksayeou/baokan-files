The State-Owned Yangquan Coal Mine Victoriously Concludes Anti-Foreman Movement
Establishes New Three-Level Production Organization
Over 300 Workers Promoted to Leadership Positions

[This newspaper reported] The movement to abolish the feudal foreman system at the No. 4 and Yugong Mines, which belong to the state-owned Yangquan Coal Mine, has now basically concluded. The remnants of the old foremen have been thoroughly eliminated, and a new labor organization has been established.

The struggle to abolish the feudal foreman system in this mine was carried out in a prepared, planned, and step-by-step manner. Before the movement, the Mining Bureau organized a training class of more than 150 advanced workers to cultivate the backbone of the movement. In order to create experience in implementing the "individual piecework, group responsibility" system after the abolition of the foreman system, No. 4 Mine also selected 15 cadres and more than 50 workers, organized them into groups according to the principle of voluntary combination, and conducted typical experiments. After all preparations were completed, the anti-foreman system movement began to unfold steadily according to the established guidelines.

After the anti-foreman struggle began, the No. 57 longwall mining team was first used as a typical experiment. Cadres went deep into the group, discovered activists, cultivated the backbone of the struggle, and divided and won over personnel who were drawn in by the feudal relationships of the team leaders to strengthen the power of the working masses and mobilize workers to speak out about their suffering and expose the crimes of the foremen. After gaining some experience in the group, various meetings were held to educate the workers of the entire mine with actual materials to raise their class consciousness. At the mass rally, the administrative负责人负责人 announced the policy of resolutely and thoroughly abolishing the foreman system. The person in charge of the Yangquan Mining Area Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party stated that the party members who were foremen would be suspended from their positions in the party. At the same time, the foreman representatives in the factory management committee were removed and replaced with true worker representatives. Through democratic elections, a temporary workers' representative assembly was also established. The new representative assembly and management committee played a significant role. The review of new cadres and the handling of major issues such as foremen went through the steps of workers expressing their opinions, the representative assembly discussing, and the management committee deciding. Currently, 76 foreman elements who had usurped leadership positions such as section chiefs, team leaders, and group leaders have been removed from their positions. Among them, seven who committed heinous crimes have been handed over to the government for legal action at the request of the masses. In addition, twelve have been expelled from the mine; eight have been transferred for training or reassigned; and forty-nine have been demoted to ordinary workers for reform through labor. Fifteen active workers have been promoted to section chiefs, thirty-eight have been promoted to technicians, and two hundred and seventy-nine have been selected as group leaders.

After the abolition of the foreman system, the miners of Yangquan truly felt that they had become masters. They established a new labor organization; that is, the organization that canceled the two-level rule of team leaders and group leaders, and changed it to the group responsibility system (Editor's note: The old production organization was a five-level system of mine manager, section chief, team leader, group leader, and group leader. The new organization is a three-level system of mine manager, section chief, and group leader). This organizational form strengthened the connection between workers and leaders and made the labor organization more reasonable. The workers of Yugong Mine appropriately divided themselves into 66 groups according to the mining area and the amount of coal produced to undertake tunneling, longwall mining, construction, and transportation work. Workers' welfare matters such as canteens, barbershops, cooperatives, and lamp oil have also been properly resolved. The enthusiasm of the employees for production has been high, and production efficiency has been significantly improved. In the first half of April, the direct efficiency of the underground operations in Pit 1 was an average of 1.0667 tons of coal mined per worker per day; Pit 2 was 1.1577 tons. After the anti-foreman struggle began, in the second half of the month, the direct efficiency of the underground operations in Pit 1 increased to 1.4558 tons, an increase of 37%; Pit 2 increased to 1.3227 tons, an increase of 14%. The workers wrote on the coal cars: "We want to complete the production tasks for 1950!" "We want to be labor heroes!" These are all concrete manifestations of the workers' increased enthusiasm for production after the foreman system was abolished.

　　国营阳泉煤矿反把头运动胜利结束
    建立起新的三级制生产组织
    三百多工人提升到领导地位
    【本报讯】国营阳泉煤矿所属四矿、裕公两矿的废除封建把头制度运动，现已基本结束。旧的把头残余已经彻底肃清，新的劳动组织已经建立。
    该矿废除封建把头制度的斗争，是有准备、有计划、有步骤进行的。运动之前，矿务局曾组织了包括一百五十多名工人先进分子的训练班，培养运动中的骨干。为了创造废除把头制度后、实行“个体计件、小组负责”制度的经验，四矿又抽调了十五个干部，五十多名工人，按自愿结合原则，编成小组，进行典型试验。一切准备就绪后，反把头制度运动始按既定方针稳步展开。
    反把头斗争开始后，首先在回采五十七组作典型试验。干部深入该组，发现积极分子；培养斗争骨干；分化争取大组长以封建关系拉拢来的人员，壮大工人群众的力量；发动工人进行诉苦，揭露把头罪恶。在该组取得一定经验后，即召开了各种会议，用实际材料教育全矿工人，提高他们的阶级觉悟。在群众大会上，行政负责人宣布坚决彻底废除把头制的方针和政策。中共矿区党委负责人声明，停止把头成分的党员在党内所担任的职务。同时，并撤消了工厂管理委员会中的把头代表，补选真正的工人代表。又经民主选举，产生了临时工人代表会。新的代表会和管委会起了很大作用。审查新干部，处理把头等重大问题，都经过工人提意见、代表会讨论、管委会决定的步骤。现在，窃居股长、队长、大组长等领导职位的把头分子七十六人已予撤职。其中七个罪大恶极的分子，经群众要求，已送政府法办。另有开除出矿的十二人；调训或调用的八人；降为普通工人，在劳动中改造的四十九人。工人中的积极分子，已有十五名被提为股长，三十八名被提为技术人员，二百七十九名被选为小组长。
    把头制废除后，阳泉的矿工真正感到自己做了主人。他们建立了新的劳动组织；即取消队长、大组长两级统治的组织，改为小组负责制（编者按：旧的生产机构为矿长、股长、队长、大组长、小组长五级制，新机构为矿长、股长、小组长三级制）。这种组织形式，密切了工人与领导的联系，也使劳动组织更加合理。裕公矿的工人根据采煤地区、出煤多少的情况，适当地分成六十六个小组，分担掘进、回采、修建、运输等工作。工人福利事项如食堂、理发、合作社及灯油等问题，也都获得了适当的解决。职工生产情绪高涨，生产效率已经显著提高。四月份上半月一坑井下直接效率为每天每工平均采煤一点零六六七吨；二坑为一点一五七七吨。反把头斗争开始后，下半月一坑井下直接效率提高到一点四五五八吨，即提高了百分之三十七；二坑提高到一点三二二七吨，即提高了百分之十四。工人们在煤车上写着：“我们要完成一九五○年的生产任务！”“我们要当劳动英雄！”这些都是取消把头制后工人提高了生产积极性的具体表现。
