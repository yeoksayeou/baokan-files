　　North China Cotton Production Survey
    Agricultural Planning Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Central People's Government
    Last autumn, North China conducted a large-scale typical survey, and the cotton production survey was one of the important projects. Some issues from this survey are published here as a reference for increasing cotton production this year.
    This survey covered 49 counties, 107 villages, and 2,229 cotton-growing households in Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces, with a total of 44,847 mu of cultivated land, of which 25.86 percent was irrigated land and 74.14 percent was dry land.
    I. Cotton Planting Area: The original planned cotton planting area was 5,847 mu, but due to damage from drought, floods, hail, and other disasters, the actual area with cotton seedlings was only 5,447 mu, accounting for 93.15 percent of the original planned area. This means that seedling loss was 6.85 percent, which is higher than the 4.5 percent seedling loss in 1935 (see "Chinese Cotton Production Statistics"). Seedling loss was more prevalent in dry land, accounting for 8.8 percent of the original dry land cotton area, while it was less in irrigated land, accounting for 1.7 percent of the original irrigated cotton area. The actual cotton field area accounted for 12.15 percent of the cultivated land, of which irrigated cotton accounted for 34.72 percent and dry land cotton accounted for 65.28 percent. Among the actual cotton fields, American cotton accounted for 70.39 percent and Chinese cotton accounted for 29.61 percent, which is a slight change from the situation in 1936, where American cotton accounted for 66.63 percent and Chinese cotton accounted for 33.37 percent (see same source). However, the current purity of American cotton is lower than before the war.
    II. Yield and Price Ratio: In 1948, the average yield per mu of Chinese cotton (seed cotton) was 53.56 jin, and in 1949 it was 48.15 jin, a decrease of 10.11 percent. In 1948, the average yield per mu of American cotton was 60.41 jin, and in 1949 it was 57.42 jin, a decrease of 4.45 percent. In 1949, the yield of American cotton was 11.3 percent higher than that of Chinese cotton.
    Based on the price ratio of one jin of lint cotton to millet: Before the autumn harvest in 1949, the average for Chinese cotton was 8.73 and for American cotton was 8.88, with American cotton being 1.7 percent higher than Chinese cotton. This price ratio is relatively reasonable, and the masses do not have many objections. This shows that the income from planting American cotton is slightly higher than that from Chinese cotton, but this difference is not enough to strongly stimulate the masses to plant American cotton.
    III. Cultivation Management: The percentages of cotton fields with different numbers of plowing, harrowing, and weeding are as follows: Plowing once: 34.75 percent, plowing twice: 45.08 percent, plowing three times: 20.17 percent; harrowing once: 13.12 percent, harrowing twice: 36.49 percent, harrowing three times: 31.28 percent, harrowing four times: 19.11 percent; weeding once: 0.16 percent, weeding twice: 5.36 percent, weeding three times: 21.61 percent, weeding four times: 34.89 percent, weeding five times: 22.31 percent, weeding six times: 10.11 percent, weeding seven times: 5.56 percent. This is still quite far from the agricultural proverb: "Plow three times, harrow four times, and weed eight times, and the cotton bolls will be as big as garlic braids," especially since the plowing is too shallow (in the Soviet Union, the general plowing depth is 6 to 7.5 inches, and the deepest reaches 12 inches). The plowing and harrowing work for this year's cotton fields has already passed, and we should especially focus on weeding from now on, preferably four to five times or more.
    The average application of soil fertilizer per mu is 2,233 jin (excluding fine fertilizer and topdressing), which is still one-third less than before the war. Very little fine fertilizer (oil cake, chemical fertilizer, etc.) and topdressing are used in various places. Among the villages surveyed, only 11 villages used fine fertilizer and 21 villages applied topdressing. The lack of fine fertilizer and topdressing for cotton is the main reason for the low yield. This year, we should promote the widespread application of topdressing to increase cotton yield.
    The survey of irrigation times for irrigated cotton is incomplete, but it is certain that the number of irrigations is too small. For example, irrigating once accounts for 57.83 percent, irrigating twice accounts for 24.42 percent, irrigating three times accounts for 11.30 percent, irrigating four times accounts for only 4.92 percent, and lack of irrigation due to water shortage accounts for 1.53 percent. In Soviet Central Asia, cotton fields are irrigated at least three times, and at most sixteen times. Of course, the number of irrigations should be based on rainfall and soil quality, and cannot be generalized. According to Soviet experiments: cotton needs the most water when it is growing leaves and forming bolls, and the number of irrigations should be increased during the flowering period, but the amount of water should be reduced. This method of irrigation is most effective.
    According to the survey, generally all cotton plants are topped, with only 0.13 percent not topped, while topping three times accounts for 48.55 percent. The number of households that pinch off the growing tip accounts for 84.2 percent of the cotton-growing households, with an average of 1.64 pinchings per household. The number of households that control pests accounts for only 21.6 percent of the cotton-growing households. This shows that pest control has not been actively and widely carried out. How to organize and lead cotton farmers to widely carry out pest control is also an important aspect of increasing cotton production in the future.
    During the survey, 24.78 percent of the cotton-growing households requested the organization of cotton production cooperatives, which is a new issue worth studying in various places.

### 华北棉产调查

　　华北棉产调查
    中央人民政府农业部农业计划司
    去秋华北曾举行了大规模的典型调查，棉产调查是其中的重要项目之一。现将这个调查的一些问题发表于此，作为今年提高棉产的参考。
    这个调查广及河北、山西、平原四十九县，一百零七村，二千二百廿九个植棉户，共有耕地四万四千八百四十七亩，其中水地占百分之二五点八六，旱地占百分之七四点一四。
    一、植棉面积：原植棉五千八百四十七亩，因受旱涝雹等灾害破坏，实有棉苗仅五千四百四十七亩，占原植棉面积百分之九三点一五，就是说，废苗占百分之六点八五，较之一九三五年废苗占百分之四点五（见《中国棉产统计》）为高。废苗以旱地为多，占原旱地棉百分之八点八，水地棉较少，占原水地棉百分之一点七。实有棉田占耕地百分之十二点一五，其中水地棉占百分之三四点七二，旱地棉占百分之六五点二八。在实有棉田中美棉占百分之七○点三九，中棉占百分之二九点六一，较之一九三六年美棉占百分之六六点六三，中棉占百分之三三点三七（见同上）的情况有些改变，但现有美棉的纯度较战前为低。
    二、产额与比价：中棉一九四八年每亩平均产额（籽棉）五三点五六斤，一九四九年为四八点一五斤，减少百分之十点一一，美棉一九四八年每亩平均产额六○点四一斤，一九四九年为五七点四二斤，减少百分之四点四五，一九四九年美棉较中棉产额高百分之一一点三。
    按一斤皮棉与小米比价：一九四九年秋收前平均中棉为八点七三，美棉为八点八八，美棉较中棉高百分之一点七。这个比价是比较合式的，群众没有很多意见。由此可看出种植美棉的收益较中棉稍高，但如此差额还不能有力的刺激群众种植美棉。
    三、栽培管理：棉田的耕、耙、锄苗次数百分比如下——耕一次的三四点七五，耕二次的四五点○八，耕三次的二○点一七；耙一次的一三点一二，耙二次的三六点四九，耙三次的三一点二八，耙四次的一九点一一；锄一次的○点一六，锄二次的五点三六，锄三次的二一点六一，锄四次的三四点八九，锄五次的二二点三一，锄六次的一○点一一，锄七次的五点五六。较之农谚所说：“耕三耙四锄八遍，结的棉桃赛蒜辫”，尚有相当距离，特别是耕得太浅（苏联一般耕深六至七寸半，最深者达十二寸）。今年的棉田耕耙工作已过去，今后应特别抓紧锄苗，最好要锄四至五次以上。
    每亩平均施土粪二千二百三十三斤（未计细肥及追肥部分），较之战前尚差三分之一。各地都很少施用细肥（油饼、化学肥料等）和追肥，在所调查的诸村中仅有十一村曾用细肥，有二十一村施追肥。棉花不施细肥和追肥，这是产量低的主要原因，今年我们应提倡广施追肥，以提高棉花产量。
    水地棉花灌溉次数调查的不完全，但灌溉的次数太少，这是可以肯定的。例如浇一次的占百分之五七点八三，浇二次的占百分之二四点四二，浇三次的占百分之一一点三○，浇四次的仅百分之四点九二，因缺水未浇的占百分之一点五三。苏联在中亚细亚的棉田最少灌溉三次，最多的灌溉十六次。当然灌溉次数的多少应根据雨量和土质，不能一概而论。据苏联实验：棉花在长叶及结桃时需水最多，在开花期浇的次数要多，但水量要少，这样灌溉的收效最好。
    据调查一般的都打槎，不打槎的仅占百分之零点一三，而打槎三次的占百分之四八点五五，摘尖的户数占植棉户数百分之八四点二，每户平均摘尖一点六四次，防治虫害的户数仅占植棉户数百分之二一点六，由此可见防治虫害尚未积极的广泛的开展，今后如何组织领导棉农广泛的开展防治虫害，这也是提高棉产的重要一环。
    在调查过程中，有百分之二四点七八的植棉户，要求组织棉产合作社，这是值得各地研究的新的课题。
