　　Jiangxi Provincial State Banks and State-Owned Enterprises
    Support Private Industry and Commerce in Nanchang
    [This newspaper, Nanchang] In recent months, the Jiangxi Provincial State Bank and various state-owned enterprises have resolved many difficulties for private industrial and commercial enterprises through methods such as loans, orders, commissioned processing, and acquisitions, and have vigorously supported production endeavors beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. From January to March, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Bank loaned over 26 billion yuan to private industrial and commercial enterprises, exceeding 276 percent of the total amount loaned in the second half of last year. Among state-owned enterprises, in addition to the original Provincial Trading Company, which has been supporting the Nanchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Soap Factory, Match Factory, and Rice Mill since August of last year, the Nanchang branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company exchanged cotton for 66 bales of cotton yarn from the Jiujiang Xingzhong Yarn Factory from the second half of April to mid-May, and purchased 245 bales with cash. This purchase volume accounts for approximately 60 percent of the factory's total production in the first and second ten-day periods of May. Recently, the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company also signed a first-phase (two-month) processing contract with the factory, using 4,000 dan of ginned cotton to process 900 bales of cotton yarn. It is also preparing to sign a processing contract with the Nanchang Xin Sheng Yarn Factory. The company also used 2 billion yuan in cash to purchase 314 bales of cotton yarn and 185 bolts of cotton cloth from private factories in Nanchang. The Jiangxi Provincial Company of the China Department Store has also purchased 850 million yuan worth of finished products to solve the difficulty of sluggish sales for various private factories in Nanchang.
    In addition, the Nanchang Xinhua Bookstore and the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Bureau have also supported some private printing plants and machine iron factories through commissioned processing.
    The government's support has played a significant role in the recovery and development of general legitimate private industry and commerce. The 22 dyeing workshops, including Nanchang Tongqingxiang, were in a state of semi-shutdown in June and July of last year due to tight capital turnover. After dyeing 8,000 bolts of cloth for the Trading Company, they not only resumed normal production but also improved the business of the dye industry. The Xin Sheng Yarn Factory increased from 2,500 spindles to 5,000 spindles. The Continental Machinery Factory increased its monthly consumption of pig iron from 20 dan to 50 dan. Before liberation, there were only eight textile factories and 38 knitting factories; now, there are 20 textile factories and 63 knitting factories.
    However, in supporting private enterprises, both the public and private sectors have experienced some deviations. On the People's Bank side, loose lending has led to a disconnection from currency withdrawal. Moreover, insufficient investigation, review, and inspection of loan applicants, and overly lenient conditions have resulted in some loans not playing their due role or being unable to be recovered on time. On the private side, there has also been a serious reliance on the idea of "using public funds to support private interests" or a tendency to divert order funds for speculation. This shows that there were some problems between public and private enterprises in the past. Today, some of these problems have been appropriately resolved, and others are being planned for gradual resolution.

### 江西省国家银行和国营企业  扶植南昌私营工商业

　　江西省国家银行和国营企业
    扶植南昌私营工商业
    【本报南昌讯】江西省国家银行和各国营企业近数月来曾通过贷款、订货、委托加工、收购等方式，替私营工商业解决了不少困难，并对有利于国计民生的生产事业加以有力的扶植。江西省人民银行一至三月份对私营工商业贷款二百六十余亿元，超过了去年下半年贷出总额的百分之二百七十六。国营企业中，除原省贸易公司从去年八月以来即对南昌市染织厂、肥皂厂、火柴厂、碾米厂进行扶植外，中国花纱布公司南昌分公司于四月下半月起至五月中旬止，又曾向九江兴中纱厂用棉花换进棉纱六十六件，现款收购二百四十五件。此项收购数量约占该厂五月上、中旬生产总额的百分之六十。最近花纱布公司又与该厂订立了第一期（两月）加工合同，以皮棉四千担加工为棉纱九百件。与南昌新甡纱厂亦准备签订加工合同。该公司又另以二十亿现款于南昌市收购私营工厂棉纱三百一十四件，棉布一百八十五匹。中国百货公司江西省公司为解决南昌市各私营工厂成品滞销的困难，亦收购了价值八亿五千万元的成品。
    此外，南昌新华书店，江西省公路局亦曾以委托加工方式扶助了一些私营印刷厂、机器铁工厂等。
    政府以上这些扶植，对一般正当私营工商业的恢复和发展是起了不小作用的。南昌市同庆祥等二十二家染坊去年六、七月间曾因资金周转不灵陷于半停工状态，后经为贸易公司代染八千匹布后，不仅恢复了正常生产，且因而使颜料业生意好转。新甡纱厂由二千五百枚纱锭增到了五千枚。大陆机器厂由每月需用生铁二十担增到了五十担。解放前纺织业只八家、针织业只三十八家，现纺织业已增到二十家，针织业已增到六十三家。
    但在扶助私营企业中，公私双方均曾发生过若干偏差。在人民银行方面，曾因放款松滥，致使与货币回笼相脱节。并且因对贷款户调查、审查、检查不够，条件太宽，致使有些贷款未发挥应有的作用或无法如期收回。私营方面也曾严重地存在着“以公养私”的依赖思想或挪用订货款项进行投机勾当的偏向。这说明了过去在公私企业之间，是存在着若干问题，在今天这些问题有的已获得适当解决，有的正计划逐步解决中。
