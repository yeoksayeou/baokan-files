    Emergency Relief for Members Affected by Explosion
    First District Barber Industry Workers Console Victims of the Explosion
    [This Newspaper's Report] In this explosion at the Fuhua Fireworks Factory, many workshops and independent laborers engaged in special crafts production were damaged. The Beijing Special Crafts Federation specially dispatched Federation Director Liu Zhenhua and others to the scene to investigate and provide assistance. They found that members of the enamelware and ivory industries had their houses destroyed, people were injured, and they were without means of support. Each household was given fourteen days' worth of food expenses, pending resettlement. There must be a large number of households that have not yet been discovered. The Federation has issued a notice to the affected members to register with the Federation. The Federation has prepared "earmarked funds" and has already raised relief funds, preparing to provide practical relief based on the severity of the disaster.
    [This Newspaper's Report] Workers in the barber industry in the First District spontaneously organized a condolence team to comfort the injured victims of the Fuhua Fireworks Factory explosion. On the second day after the explosion at the Fuhua Fireworks Factory, the First District Barber Industry Union decided to launch a fundraising campaign. On that day, all members donated a total of 178,800 yuan; the managers of ten barbershops also donated 24,000 yuan. That evening, they used the money to buy forty catties of cream biscuits and organized a condolence team to visit the Xiehe Hospital and the Municipal Third Hospital. Early in the morning of the 16th, fourteen representatives went to the "Post-Disaster Committee" to hand over the remaining twenty-nine catties of biscuits. They also went to the scene to comfort the frightened masses.
