Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: Speech by Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 22nd. The full text is as follows: Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

    We fully agree with and support Chairman Mao's instructions, Vice Chairman Liu's report on land reform, Premier Zhou's political report, and the reports of Vice Premiers Chen and Guo and other leaders. We will resolutely implement them in our work in the Northeast region. Although land reform in the Northeast has been completed, Vice Chairman Liu's report, its ideology, spirit, and leadership methods, are still of great educational significance for the people of the Northeast and cadres at all levels.

    Chairman Mao instructed us that the main task at present is to strive for a fundamental improvement in the nation's financial and economic situation, pointed out the three conditions needed to achieve this improvement, and pointed out that land reform is the central topic of this meeting. I believe that these reports are a concrete manifestation of Chairman Mao's instructions. Experience in the Northeast also proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's instructions and these reports. Many people have been to the Northeast and have seen that economic construction is proceeding in a relatively orderly manner. Some people have raised the question of why the Northeast's economy is recovering relatively quickly. In fact, there is only one truth: it is because the Northeast completed land reform relatively early under the leadership of Chairman Mao. In the past, when people spoke of the Northeast, they thought of bandits [红胡子, literally "Red Beards"]. But the bandits in the Northeast have been uprooted, and this is also because land reform has been completed. The development of education in the Northeast in recent years, and the establishment of a completely new people's democratic regime in the countryside, are all because land reform has been completed and the peasants have been liberated.

    The Northeast basically completed land reform in the spring of 1948. On this basis, the people were mobilized and the war was won. It was also on this basis that, when the Northeast was completely liberated at the end of 1948, Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China gave us the task of restoring and rebuilding the Northeast's economy and building the Northeast into an industrial base. What has the situation been like since last year? In 1949, the total output value of state-owned industry in the Northeast was 7.96 million tons of grain, accounting for 35 percent of the total industrial and agricultural output. In 1950, state-owned industrial production will be equal to 193 percent of 1949, and the total output value of state-owned industry will reach 15 million tons of grain, accounting for 43 percent of the total industrial and agricultural output for the entire year. As of March this year, 317 factories have started operations, and by the end of this year, 344 factories will have started operations. Since last year, the number of employees in state-owned enterprises has increased by more than 400,000.

    In 1949, investment in national economic construction accounted for 30.6 percent of total fiscal expenditure. According to the 1950 plan, this will increase to 53.74 percent of total fiscal expenditure. This year's administrative expenses will be only 7.33 percent.

    Industrial production in the first quarter of 1950 has completed 109.2 percent of the original plan, which is 24.5 percent of the annual plan.

    This year's agricultural production basically completed the entire planting plan by the end of May. If there are no major disasters, we will strive to achieve 18 million tons of grain. The cotton planting area has reached 2.7 million mu, more than double that of last year. After the land reform, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has generally increased. The slogan of simply plowing more and tilling more is not enough. At the same time, in order to further improve the quantity and quality of agricultural products, this year we have particularly emphasized improving agricultural production technology. Therefore, the fertilizer application area this year has generally increased by 10 percent. Most of the seeds for major grains have been disinfected. The planting area for improved varieties has reached 1 million mu, and it is planned to convert most of the area to improved varieties within three to five years. More than 12,000 improved farm implements and more than 3,000 new Soviet-style animal-drawn farm implements have been distributed. In order to accumulate experience and train cadres, 12 mechanized farms have been established, cultivating 400,000 mu this year, and it is expected to reach 1.5 million mu by the end of 1952. A tractor station for farmers to rent has been established near Shenyang.

    Due to the recovery and development of the economy, prices are relatively stable, and people's lives have been initially improved. The average real wage of workers and staff in May 1949 was 110, and now it averages over 150. According to a survey of 21 villages in 16 counties in Heilongjiang Province, middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants originally accounted for 16.1 percent of the total number of households before the land reform, but now they account for 53.8 percent. According to a report from Jilin Province, the average surplus grain per person in rural areas is 250 jin. The improvement of people's lives has expanded the market for industrial products. In 1948, 1.2 million bolts of cloth were sold in the Northeast; in 1949, 3.2 million bolts; and in 1950, it is planned to sell 9 million bolts. From January to early May, 2.66 million bolts of cloth and 300,000 bundles of yarn have been sold.

    With the rapid recovery and development of the state-owned economy, private industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood have also developed. In 1949, more than 31,000 private industrial and commercial enterprises were added in the entire Northeast. Taking Shenyang as an example, according to statistics as of April 1950, the number of private industrial enterprises increased from 6,546 at the time of liberation to 13,459. The number of employees increased from 36,008 to 56,328. The state's processing and ordering from private enterprises have greatly increased. The total value of processing by state-owned enterprises through private enterprises in the first quarter of this year is equal to 101 percent of the entire year of 1949. The total value of orders placed by state-owned enterprises to private enterprises in the first quarter is equal to 461 percent of the entire year of 1949.

    All of these prove that the completion of land reform has greatly increased the peasants' enthusiasm for production, increased productivity, expanded the market for industrial products, and increased industrial investment, thereby opening the way for industrial construction. It also proves that with the development of state-owned enterprises, legitimate private enterprises have also developed. At the same time, in the recovery and development of the state-owned economy in the Northeast, all public and private enterprises have undergone a process of transformation and reorganization.

    These also prove that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, the Chinese people can not only wage revolutionary wars, but also build a new country and do a good job in economic construction. Let those imperialist elements and Kuomintang reactionaries go ahead and fantasize and shout that we will not be able to manage the economy. I believe that in the near future, the facts that have appeared in the Northeast will also appear everywhere throughout the country. As Chairman Mao said, we have ways, and we have hope.

    The Northeast's economy has recovered relatively quickly not only because the land reform in the Northeast was completed earlier and the victory of the war came earlier, but also because of the great victories in the War of Liberation and in finance and economics on a national scale. It is also due to the joint efforts of all employees, technicians, all working peasants, intellectuals, cadres at all levels, and people from all walks of life in the Northeast, as well as the assistance of Soviet experts. What is particularly important is the correct leadership and various support of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. As early as the beginning of the liberation of the Northeast, Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made the wise decision to minimize the impact of the war on the Northeast as much as possible in many measures, so that the Northeast could devote all its efforts to economic construction. It must be pointed out that without such wise leadership and great measures from the Central Committee, the Northeast could not have achieved these achievements so quickly.

    The work we have already done is only a beginning for the future revolutionary construction cause. There are still many shortcomings and problems in our work. Our economic plan itself is still very incomplete. At the same time, as far as the whole country is concerned, this is still a partial plan, and it can only be a component part of the national economic construction plan. In industrial production, it is necessary to further carry out the new record movement, reduce costs, and improve quality. It is also necessary to further implement democratic management, economic accounting systems, and production responsibility systems. It is still necessary to solve the difficulty of lacking technical personnel and skilled workers. We should thank the Central Committee and various regions for giving us a lot of help in recruitment. In addition, there are still some problems that need to be solved between production and sales, and between the public and private sectors. Therefore, a rational adjustment of industry and commerce is also necessary in the Northeast. There are still bureaucratic and commandist styles of work among some cadres. It is necessary to seriously rectify the style of work and conduct rotational training for cadres. We need to be more vigilant at all times against the sabotage elements of the American-Chiang reactionaries. We must closely unite with the people of the Northeast, consolidate and develop the people's democratic united front, be conscientious and diligent, constantly overcome various difficulties, discover and solve various problems, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, steadily advance together with the various regions within the country!

### 东北人民政府副主席  林枫的发言

    东北人民政府副主席
    林枫的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】东北人民政府副主席林枫二十二日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我们完全同意和拥护毛主席的指示，刘副主席的土地改革报告，周总理的政治报告，陈、郭两副总理和其他首长们的报告。我们一定坚决地在东北地区的工作中贯彻执行。东北的土改虽然已经完成了，但刘副主席报告的思想和精神及领导方法，对于东北人民和各级干部还是有重大的教育意义的。
    毛主席指示我们，目前的主要任务是为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争，指出了为获得这个好转所需要的三个条件，并指出了土地改革是这次会议的中心议题。我认为这些报告正是毛主席指示的具体化，从东北工作的体验中，也证明了毛主席的指示和这些报告的正确性。好多人到过了东北，看到了那里是在比较有秩序的进行着经济建设，有些人发生了一个问题，为什么东北经济恢复得比较快，其实真理只有一个，那就是因为东北在毛主席的领导下比较早的完成了土地改革。在过去一说到东北，就联想到红胡子，但是东北的红胡子已经连根拔掉了，这也是因为完成了土地改革。东北的教育几年来有了发展，以及在乡村里建立了完全新的人民民主政权，这都是因为完成了土地改革，农民翻了身。
    东北是在一九四八年春天基本上完成了土地改革的，在这个基础上发动了人民，赢得了战争。也是在这个基础之上，当一九四八年底，东北全部解放以后，毛主席和中共中央就给了我们恢复和重建东北经济的任务，给了我们把东北建设为工业基地的任务。去年以来的情况怎么样呢？一九四九年东北公营工业生产总值七百九十六万吨粮食，占工农业生产总额的百分之三十五。一九五○年公营工业生产将等于一九四九年的百分之一百九十三，公营工业生产总值将达一千五百万吨粮食，全年公营工业生产总值将占工农业生产总额的百分之四十三。截止到今年三月，已有三百一十七个工厂开工了，到今年年底将有三百四十四个工厂开工。去年以来，公营企业职工，增加了四十多万人。
    一九四九年国民经济建设投资占全部财政支出的百分之三十点六，按照一九五○年的计划将增加到全部财政支出的百分之五十三点七四。今年的行政费则仅为百分之七点三三。
    一九五○年第一季度的工业生产，已完成了原计划的百分之一百零九点二，也就是完成了全年计划的百分之二十四点五。
    今年的农业生产，已于五月底基本上完成全部播种计划。如无大灾，将争取到一千八百万吨粮食，植棉面积已达二百七十万亩，比去年超过一倍。土改以后，农民的生产积极性普遍提高了，只是多铲多趟的口号不够了，同时，为了更加提高农产品的数量与质量，今年我们特别强调了提高农业生产技术。因此，今年的施肥面积，普遍增加百分之十。主要粮食的种籽，大部经过消毒。优良品种的播种区已达一百万亩，计划在三五年内，大部变成优良品种。已发下改良农具一万二千件，苏联新式马拉农具三千余件。为了积累经验，训练干部，开办了十二个机械农场，今年种地四十万亩，一九五二年底可达一百五十万亩。在沈阳附近开始建立了一个给农民租用的拖拉机站。
    由于经济的恢复和发展，物价比较稳定，初步的改善了人民生活。职工的实际工资一九四九年五月份平均为一百一十分，现在平均为一百五十分以上。根据黑龙江省十六个县二十一个村的调查，土改前中农和富裕中农原占总户口的百分之十六点一，现在则为百分之五十三点八。根据吉林省的报告，农村每人平均有余粮二百五十斤。人民生活的改善就扩大了工业产品的市场。一九四八年东北销售布匹一百二十万匹，一九四九年三百二十万匹，一九五○年计划推销九百万匹。一月到五月初已销售二百六十六万匹布，三十万捆纱。
    在国营经济迅速恢复与发展的情况下，有利于国计民生的私人工商业也发展了。一九四九年全东北私人工商业增加了三万一千余家。以沈阳为例，截至一九五○年四月的统计，私营工业由解放当时的六千五百四十六户增加到一万三千四百五十九户。职工从三万六千零八人增加到五万六千三百二十八人。国家向私人企业的加工、订货均有极大增加。今年第一季度国营企业经私营企业加工的总值等于一九四九年全年的百分之一百零一。第一季度国营企业向私营企业订货的总值等于一九四九年全年的百分之四百六十一。
    这些都证明了土地改革的完成，大大地提高了农民的生产积极性，提高了生产力，扩大了工业产品的市场，增加了工业投资，因而就给工业建设开辟了道路。也证明了公营企业的发展，正当的私人企业也发展了。同时，在东北国营经济的恢复和发展当中，所有公私企业大都经过了一番改造和改组的过程。
    这些也证明了中国人民在毛主席、中国共产党、中央人民政府的领导下，不仅会进行革命战争，也会建设新国家，把经济建设事业搞好。让那些帝国主义分子国民党反动派去幻想和叫喊我们是不会管理经济的罢。我相信，不久的将来，在东北出现的事实，也会在全国各地到处出现的。正如毛主席所说，我们是有办法，有希望的。
    东北经济恢复得比较迅速，不仅是由于东北的土地改革完成的较早，战争的胜利较早。同时又是由于全国范围的在解放战争上、在财政经济上的伟大胜利。也是由于东北全体职工、技术人员、全体劳动农民、知识分子、各级干部以及各界人民的共同努力和苏联专家的帮助。特别重要的是由于毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导和各种支持。远在东北解放之初，毛主席和中共中央即英明的决定了在好多措施上，要尽量使东北少受战争的影响，以便东北能以全力从事经济建设。必须指出，没有中央这样英明的领导和伟大的措施，东北是不可能这样迅速的获得这些成就的。
    我们已经做了的工作，对今后整个革命建设事业说来，还只是一个开端。我们的工作中还存在着许多缺点和问题。我们的经济计划本身，还很不周密。同时，就全国讲，这还是一个局部的计划，它也只能是全国经济建设计划的一个组成部分。在工业生产上，还需要进一步地开展新纪录运动，降低成本，提高质量。还需要进一步地贯彻管理民主化，经济核算制和生产责任制。还需要解决缺乏技术人员和熟练工人的困难，应该感谢中央和各地区在招聘工作上给了我们很多的帮助。此外，在产销之间、公私之间还存在着一些需要解决的问题，因此，合理的调整工商业，在东北是同样需要的。在某些干部中还存在着官僚主义和命令主义的作风，认真的整风和轮训干部是必需的。对于美蒋反动派破坏分子，更需要时刻的提高警惕。我们要紧紧的同东北人民在一道，巩固发展人民民主统一战线，兢兢业业，克勤克俭，不断地克服各种困难，发现和解决各种问题，学习苏联的先进经验，在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，与关内各地区一同的稳步前进！
