　　International Children's Day "June 1st" has arrived, and I congratulate all the children in Beijing on happily celebrating their own holiday.
　　The happy lives of our Chinese children are inseparable from the happy lives of children all over the world. Peace-loving people all over the world are one family, and the sons and daughters of peace-loving people all over the world are like brothers and sisters. Therefore, International Children's Day is also our Chinese children's own holiday.
　　I should particularly point out here that celebrating the first International Children's Day in our new China today is of particularly great significance. The Kuomintang reactionaries have been defeated by us and will soon be finally eliminated by us. American imperialism has also been driven out of Chinese territory, and the Chinese people have stood up. Children are the hope of our new China and a huge force in future construction work. Our generation of parents, teachers, and children's welfare workers should make every effort to cultivate the next generation.
　　Our People's Government has always been particularly concerned about children's welfare. The state uses laws to protect children. Article 48 of the Common Program clearly stipulates "protecting the health of mothers, infants, and children." The marriage law recently promulgated by the Central People's Government also details how to protect the interests of children.
　　Our Beijing Municipal People's Government has already done some work in this regard. Currently, we have 674 primary schools, with more than 3,000 classes, and a total of more than 41,000 primary school students in the city. There are 18 kindergartens with 61 classes, with a total of more than 2,000 children. The number of children of working people attending school is gradually increasing. Before liberation, there were only ten nurseries; now there are fifty, with a total of 1,925 infants and young children. These many children are living and learning happily under the direct care of their teachers or nannies. In addition, we have also widely established children's literacy classes, trying our best to admit the children of working people, so that they can also have the opportunity to receive education. There are now more than 740 classes, with more than 21,000 students. In terms of health, there are already two public maternity and child health centers, one maternity and child health hospital, one midwifery school, and one obstetrics hospital. In addition, many other public and private hospitals also do maternity and child health work. The children of truly poor working people can also see a doctor without spending money. The number of infant and child deaths has therefore been greatly reduced. In order to further promote children's health care, we have established a maternal and child health work network in various districts. In order to unify leadership and promote children's welfare work throughout the city, we have established the Beijing Municipal Maternal and Child Welfare Work Committee. We must further enrich and develop these tasks in the future.
　　Of course, so far, our work in this area is still far from our ideal. Because the People's Liberation War has not completely ended, the state's finances are quite difficult, and in addition, we do not have enough experience in children's welfare work, and there are not enough cadres. Therefore, we have done very little work in this area. But in the future, as our country's economic situation improves day by day, we must work harder in this area and do it better. Today's Soviet Union is our example and our direction of effort.
　　Finally, I would like to say a few words to the parents, teachers, and children's workers in the city: Although the children of our China have begun to embark on the road to happiness, due to long-term reactionary rule, many people still have the idea of ​​underestimating children's interests and regarding children as private property, and implementing improper education for children. For example, adults take their anger out on children when they are unhappy, beat and scold children, and even intentionally or unintentionally instill feudal superstition or backward ideas into children. This is not allowed in a new democratic society. We should do our best to publicize the provisions for the protection of children in the Common Program and the provisions on the protection of children in the Marriage Law, and we must earnestly implement them. Children's welfare workers should regard children's welfare work as a glorious task and serve children sincerely and wholeheartedly. Pay attention to and protect children's health, educate them with patriotism and internationalism, so that they love our country, love the broad masses of working people, and love all the public property of our country, especially to love our great people's leader Chairman Mao; at the same time, we must expand this spirit to the world, and love the vast working people who love peace all over the world.

### 保卫儿童权利，做好儿童工作

　　保卫儿童权利，做好儿童工作
    吴晗
    “六一”国际儿童节到了，我祝贺全北京市的小朋友们快乐地过自己的节日。
    我们中国儿童的生活幸福是和全世界儿童生活幸福分不开的，全世界爱好和平的人民都是一家人，全世界爱好和平的人民的儿女，都像同胞的兄弟姐妹一样，所以国际儿童节，也就是我们中国儿童自己的节日。
    这里我应该特别指出的，今天在我们新中国庆祝第一个国际儿童节，更是有特别重大的意义，国民党反动派已经被我们打垮了，不久就要被我们最后消灭，美帝国主义也已经从中国国土上赶走了，中国人民翻了身。儿童是我们新中国的希望，是将来建设工作中的巨大力量，我们这一代的父母们，教师们和儿童福利工作者们应该尽一切努力来培养下一代。
    我们人民政府对儿童福利事业，一直是特别关心的，国家用法律来保护儿童；共同纲领第四十八条，就明白规定了“保护母亲婴儿和儿童的健康”；最近中央人民政府所公布的婚姻法，又详细规定了怎样保障子女的利益。
    我们北京市人民政府，在这方面，已经做了一些工作。现在我们全市已经有小学六百七十四所，三千多班，共有小学生四万一千多人。幼稚园有十八所六十一班，共有儿童二千多人。劳动人民的子女上学的逐渐增加。托儿所在解放前只有十所，现在有五十所，共有婴儿和幼儿一千九百二十五人。这许多小朋友们，都在他们教师或褓姆的直接照顾下，愉快地生活着、学习着。此外我们又广泛设立了儿童识字班，尽量吸收劳动人民子弟入学，使他们能同样得到受教育的机会；现在已有七百四十多班，有学生两万一千多人。在卫生方面，已有公立妇婴保健所两所，妇婴保健院一所，助产学校一所，产科医院一所。此外其他许多公私立医院，也都附带做妇婴保健的工作。真正穷苦的劳动人民儿女，还可以不花钱看病。婴儿和儿童的死亡数字，因此就大大地减少了。为了进一步推进儿童的保健事业，我们已经在各区建立了妇幼卫生工作网。为了统一领导和推进全市儿童福利工作，我们已经成立了北京市妇幼福利工作委员会。我们今后还要使这些工作进一步充实和发展。
    当然，到目前为止，我们在这方面的工作，还离开我们的理想很远。因为人民解放战争还没有完全结束，国家的财政又相当困难，再加之我们对儿童福利工作的经验不够，干部也不够，因此我们在这方面的工作做得还很少。但是在今后，我们国家的经济情况一天天地好转，这方面的工作，就必须努力多做而且要做得更好。今天的苏联就是我们的榜样，是我们努力的方向。
    最后，我想特别对全市的父母们、教师们和儿童工作者们说几句话：我们中国的儿童虽然已经开始走上幸福的道路，但是由于长期的反动统治，许多人还存在着轻视儿童利益和以儿童为私有品的思想，对儿童施行不正当的教育。例如大人不痛快，拿小孩子出气，打骂儿童，甚至有意无意地把封建迷信或落后思想灌输给儿童，这都是新民主主义社会所不能容许的。我们应该尽力宣传共同纲领中保护儿童的规定和婚姻法中关于保护子女的规定，并须切实做到。儿童福利工作者，应当以儿童福利工作为光荣任务，诚心诚意为儿童服务。注意和保护儿童的健康，用爱国主义与国际主义教育他们，使他们热爱我们的国家，热爱广大的劳动人民，热爱我们国家的一切公共财物，特别是要热爱我们伟大的人民领袖毛主席；同时要把这种精神扩大到全世界，热爱全世界爱好和平的广大劳动人民。
