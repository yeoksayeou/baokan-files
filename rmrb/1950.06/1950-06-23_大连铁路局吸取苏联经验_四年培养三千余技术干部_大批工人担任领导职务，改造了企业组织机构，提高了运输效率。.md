　　Dalian Railway Bureau Learns from Soviet Experience: Four Years of Training Three Thousand Technical Cadres
　　A large number of workers hold leadership positions, transforming the enterprise's organizational structure and improving transportation efficiency.

　　[This newspaper dispatch] Correspondent Yin Nan reports: The Dalian Railway Bureau, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, has trained and promoted 3,475 technical cadres over the past four years, rapidly transforming the railway's organizational structure, mastering railway management, and gradually improving transportation efficiency. Workers account for more than 85 percent of the cadres trained by the bureau. These cadres have taken the lead in production posts everywhere. For example, the locomotive driver and special-class hero Liang Chao Xiang's 2,600-ton traction load broke the record of the enemy-puppet era. Nine female train drivers, including Tian Guiying, have mastered locomotive driving technology and have begun to run on the railway lines of Lushun and Dalian.

　　In order to help Chinese workers quickly become familiar with the work of the entire department and master transportation technology, Soviet comrades first boldly promoted 151 active and outstanding workers, such as line workers, dispatching switchmen, drivers, dispatchers, foremen, etc., to leadership positions, serving as factory directors, section chiefs, division chiefs, team leaders, group leaders, etc., so that they could be trained in practical work.

　　Four Methods of Training Cadres

　　At the same time, the following methods are used to train a large number of cadres:

　　1. Open regular technical schools and short-term training courses to train on-the-job workers in a planned way and recruit a large number of young people to participate in learning. Regular schools include youth technical schools and nursing schools. Short-term training courses include eight types: locomotive, vehicle inspection, engineering, transportation, electrical, water affairs, accounting, and finance. Among the 285 students in the rolling stock training class alone, there are 9 stationmasters, 5 deputy stationmasters, 36 stationmasters on duty, as well as dispatchers, train conductors, inspectors, etc.

　　2. Sign apprenticeship contracts. The master guarantees to teach the apprentice certain skills within a certain period of time (three or four months). If the apprentice is promoted, the master can receive a bonus. Because a new and correct relationship has been established between master and apprentice, the master has changed his past conservative views and adopted reasonable methods such as doing it by hand, giving instructions from the side, letting the apprentice do it himself, and the master correcting the shortcomings, so that ordinary apprentices can be promoted to skilled workers within three or four months. As of January 1950, more than 1,400 apprentices had been promoted to formal workers.

　　3. Combine business with collective research to improve the existing technical level. The characteristic of this method is to grasp a certain shortcoming in the work, and everyone studies and analyzes the reasons for its occurrence and the methods of correction, so as to educate all employees. At the same time, any invention is taken for research and analysis in order to exchange experience. During specific research, responsible comrades or engineers and technicians attend to integrate the practical experience and expertise of most people, making it systematic and theoretical. This approach has been very effective. In the study, the comparative research method was also implemented. For example, the Dalian Locomotive Depot used locomotives of the same type and coal of the same quality to compare the mileage and traction tonnage. See who saves coal and who wastes coal, compare with each other, launch discussions, and check work responsibility and labor viewpoints. This method has improved the enthusiasm of the majority of employees.

　　4. Improve business level and train cadres through the responsibility system. In 1947, the Dalian Railway Bureau abolished the incorrect locomotive shift system and established a correct responsibility system and handover system. In the past, car attendants did not participate in locomotive repairs, but now they pay great attention to the maintenance of locomotives.

　　The cadre training work of the Dalian Railway Bureau is truly organized and planned. First of all, general principles are formulated: to make everyone realize why they should learn technology, why they should make plans for learning technology, how to make plans, how to learn after the plans are made, what are the methods and contents of learning, and so on. Then, concentrate efforts to formulate typical unit plans and typical individual plans. Through collective discussion and launching competitions, it has been promoted to a mass technical learning movement.

　　Four Experiences in Training Cadres

　　The bureau's cadre training work has created the following experiences:

　　1. The railway includes many departments and requires various types of technical talents. Relying solely on long-term schools to train specialized cadres cannot meet the needs of the development of the situation. Therefore, training courses scattered in various units should be organized to implement short-term training for workers. And create a master-apprentice system, collective research, a responsibility system, etc., in order to effectively and massively train and improve the skills of cadres.

　　2. When running training courses that are separated from production, they must be closely integrated with the entire production task and the entire economic accounting system. Cadre training must be based on work needs.

　　3. Those who are promoted should be politically innocent, have skills, be familiar with and proficient in business, and be supported by the masses. We must boldly promote those who have creative ability and are loyal to the people's cause to leadership positions. An effective way to select cadres is to implement examinations.

　　4. The transfer of cadres in enterprise departments should not be frequent, otherwise it will affect production.

### 大连铁路局吸取苏联经验  四年培养三千余技术干部  大批工人担任领导职务，改造了企业组织机构，提高了运输效率。

　　大连铁路局吸取苏联经验  四年培养三千余技术干部
    大批工人担任领导职务，改造了企业组织机构，提高了运输效率。
    【本报讯】通讯员尹楠报道：大连铁路局学习苏联的先进经验，四年以来，已培养与提拔了三千四百七十五名技术干部，迅速地改造了铁路组织机构，掌握了铁路管理事业，逐步提高了运输效率。该局所培养出的干部中，工人成份占百分之八十五以上。这些干部在生产岗位上处处起了带头作用。如司机特等英雄梁超祥的二千六百吨牵引装载，打破了敌伪时代的纪录。火车女司机田桂英等九人，已掌握了机车驾驶技术，开始驰聘于旅大各铁路线上。
    苏联同志为了帮助中国职工迅速熟悉整个部门的工作，掌握交通技术，首先放手地把积极、优秀的工作人员，如线路工、调度转辙员、司机、调度员、工长等，共一百五十一名，提拔到领导工作岗位上，担任厂长、处长、科长、班、组长等，使他们在实际工作中得到锻炼。
  培养干部的四种办法
    同时，采用下列几种方法，大量培养干部：
    一、开办正规的技术学校和短期训练班，有计划地调训在职工人，并招收大批青年，参加学习。正规学校包括青年技术学校与护士学校两种。短期训练班有机务、检车、工务、运输、电务、水务、会计、财务等八种。仅车务训练班的二百八十五名学员中，就有站长九名、副站长五名、值班站长三十六名，还有调度员、车长、检查员等。
    二、订立师徒合同。师傅保证在一定时间内（三个月或四个月），教会徒弟一定的技术。徒弟升了级，师傅可以获得奖金。由于师徒间建立了新的正确的关系，师傅改变了过去的保守观点，采用了把着手做，在旁指教，由徒弟自己做、师傅纠正缺点等合理办法，使一般徒弟在三、四个月内，即可升为技术工人。至一九五○年一月止，已有一千四百多名徒弟升为正式工人。
    三、结合业务，进行集体研究，提高现有技术水平。这个办法的特点是抓住工作中的某一缺点，由大家研究分析其产生的原因与改正的办法，借以教育全体职工。同时也把任何一件创造发明拿来研究分析，以便交流经验。在具体研究的时候，负责同志或工程师、技师出席，把多数人的实际经验与特长综合起来，使之条理化，使之成为理论。这种作法收效很大。在学习中，同时实行了比较研究法。如大连机务段，以类型相同的机车，品质相同的煤炭，来比较走行里数和牵引吨数。看谁省煤，谁费煤，互相比较，展开讨论，检查工作责任心和劳动观点。这种方法，提高了广大职工的积极性。
    四、通过负责制来提高业务水平，培养干部。一九四七年，大连铁路局就废除了不正确的机车轮乘制，建立了正确的负责制和交代制度。车务员过去不参加机车修理，现在则十分注意保养机车。
    大连铁路局的培养干部工作，真正作到了有组织有计划。首先订出一般的原则：使大家认识到为什么要学习技术，学习技术为什么要订计划，如何订计划，计划订好后如何学习，学习的方法与内容是什么等等。然后集中力量，订出典型的单位计划和典型的个人计划。通过集体讨论，并发动竞赛，推广为群众性的技术学习运动。
  培养干部的四点经验
    该局培养干部工作，创造了如下几点经验：
    一、铁路上包括的部门很多，需要各种各样的技术人材，单靠长期学校来培养专门干部，不能适应形势发展的需要。因此，应该组织分散在各单位的训练班，实行工人短期训练。并创立师傅带徒弟，集体研究，负责制等制度，以便有效地大量地培养与提高干部的技术。
    二、举办脱离生产的训练班时，必须与整个生产任务与整个经济核算制度密切结合起来。培养干部必须根据工作的需要。
    三、被提拔的人，应该是政治清白的，有技术的，熟悉与精通业务的，为群众所拥护的人。必须大胆地把有创造能力，忠实于人民事业的工作者，提拔到领导岗位上去。选择干部的有效办法是实行考试。
    四、企业部门干部的调动不应频繁，否则会影响生产。
