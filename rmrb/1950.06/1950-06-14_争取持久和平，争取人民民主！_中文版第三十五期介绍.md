Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: The Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau's organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 35 (Total No. 74), has been published here. The editorial of this issue is titled "The Communist Party Struggles Against Bourgeois Ideology." The editorial points out: American imperialism and the Tito gang are trying to spread the ideas of nationalism, chauvinism, and cosmopolitanism in various people's democratic countries in order to achieve their despicable goals. It would be a serious mistake to underestimate or compromise with the influence of nationalism, chauvinism, and cosmopolitanism. The editorial says: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has set an example for us, showing us how to irreconcilably struggle against bourgeois ideology and all—even the slightest—manifestations of bourgeois ideological influence on individual wavering elements among the working people. The editorial says: Communist Parties in various countries are using the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to engage in the Marxist-Leninist education of party members with great effort; they are conducting an active struggle against bourgeois ideology, propagating proletarian ideology, and conducting ideological education of the proletariat and the broad masses of people in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism.

The current issue of the publication contains an article by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, entitled "Struggle for France's National Independence, for Peace," which describes the current program of struggle of the French Communist Party and calls on the French people to unite and struggle to establish a democratic and nationally united French government, a morally pure government that safeguards peace. The article points out that there are still some shortcomings and errors within the French Party that are sufficient to weaken the Party's work, and therefore also weaken the struggle for peace and national independence. The most serious of these is underestimating the danger of war, and also underestimating the strength of the working class and the peace camp, which possess all the necessary conditions to defeat the war-mongers' plans. The article says: Sometimes, we meet some party members who are not brave enough to declare our friendship and trust in the Soviet Union; they do not see the most important role played by the Soviet Union in the struggle for peace. The article points out: Those who vacillate in their attitude towards the Soviet Union have in fact fallen to the position of nationalism and abandoned the principles of proletarian internationalism. The article says: Our Party is strengthening its own forces, despite the enemy's attempts to strike it from within. We see how the imperialists use the Tito agency and Trotskyite groups. Communists must show firm revolutionary vigilance in order to expose all hostile elements—police, secret agents, spies, and informers sent by the bourgeoisie into the Party—and expel them from our ranks.

Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, in his article "Britain After the General Election and the Tasks of the CPGB," discusses the current tasks of the CPGB and confidently asserts: Our strength must develop and strengthen; Marxism-Leninism, which guides our Party, has enabled half of humanity to realize their wishes and has brought them new life, and it will lead the British people to the path of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the Chinese people.

Antonín Zápotocký, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, in his article "Czechoslovakia Launches Socialist Competition and Shock Work Movement," introduces Czechoslovakia's experience in organizing production competitions. The article points out: The most serious shortcoming in the current competition in Czechoslovakia is that the production quotas do not automatically increase with the development of socialist competition. The article says: Until today, the party and trade union organizations in the factories have not understood that determining correct production quotas is one of the main tasks of factory work. Remaining at backward production standards is very harmful to the cause of socialism. This means that it will hinder the development of technology and productivity, hinder the development of socialist competition, and the completion of plans for increased production and increased labor productivity, and will prolong the time required to restore industrial construction, and will prevent further improvement of the living standards of the working people. We must, as far as possible in the shortest period, make production standards and wages compatible with the tasks of the economic plan of that industrial sector. The principle of piecework pay must be more strictly observed than before, and more attention should be paid to encouraging shock workers, so that they can develop a greater interest in their work.

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版第三十五期介绍
    【新华社十二日讯】共产党与工人党情报局机关报《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第三十五期（总第七十四期）已于此间出版。该刊这一期的社论题为《共产党为反对资产阶级思想而斗争》。社论指出：美国帝国主义及铁托匪帮力图在各人民民主国家散布民族主义、沙文主义及世界主义的思想，以遂行其卑劣的目的。过低估计民族主义、沙文主义、世界主义的影响或与它们妥协，将是严重的错误。该社论说：苏联共产党已给我们树立了一个楷模，指示我们如何不调和地去与资产阶级思想以及资产阶级思想影响在劳动人民中的个别动摇分子身上的一切——即使是最轻微的——表现作斗争。该社论说：各国共产党，正利用苏联共产党的经验，以极大的努力从事党员的马列主义教育；他们正在进行积极的斗争，反对资产阶级思想，传布无产阶级思想，以马列主义精神对无产阶级及广大人民群众进行思想教育。
    该刊本期登载的法国共产党总书记多列士作《为法国的民族独立，为和平而斗争》一文，叙述了法国共产党目前的斗争纲领，并号召法国人民团结起来为建立一个民主与全国一致的法国政府，一个道德上纯洁的、维护和平的政府而斗争。该文指出：法国党内尚存在着一些足以削弱党的工作、因此也是削弱争取和平与民族独立的斗争的缺点与错误，其中最严重的是过低估计战争危险，同时也是过低估计拥有一切必要条件，足以挫败战争贩子的计划的工人阶级的力量及和平阵营的力量。该文说：有时，我们会遇见一些党员，他们不够勇敢，不敢宣布我们对苏联的友谊与信任；他们没有看见苏联在争取和平的斗争中所起的最重大的作用。该文指出：这些对苏联的态度动摇不定的人，实际上已堕落到民族主义的立场，放弃了无产阶级的国际主义的原则。该文说：我们党正在壮大自己的力量，尽管敌人企图从内部打击它。我们看见帝国主义分子如何利用铁托代理机关及托派小集团。共产党人必须表现坚定的革命警惕性，以便揭露一切敌对分子——资产阶级派到党内的警察、特务、间谍、密探，并把它们从自己队伍中驱逐出去。
    英国共产党总书记波立特的《大选以后的不列颠及英共的任务》一文，论述了英共当前任务，并确信地说：我们的力量必然发展并加强；作为我们党的指南的马列主义，已使一半的人类实现了他们的愿望，并带给他们以新的生命，它并将把英国人民引导到苏联、各人民民主国家及中国人民的道路上去。
    捷共中央主席团委员佛兰克的《捷克展开了社会主义竞赛与突击运动》一文，介绍了捷克在组织生产竞赛方面的经验。该文指出：捷克目前在竞赛上的最严重的缺点是生产的定额并没有自动地随着社会主义竞赛的开展而提高。该文说：直到今天，工厂中党与工会的组织尚没有了解确定正确的生产定额是工厂工作的主要任务之一。停留在落后的生产标准上对社会主义事业有很大的危害。这就是说它会阻滞技术与生产力的发展，会阻碍社会主义竞赛的开展，以及增产计划与提高劳动生产力计划的完成，会延长恢复工业建设所需的时间，会阻止劳动人民生活的更进一步改善。我们必须尽可能在最短期间，使生产标准及工资能与该工业部门的经济计划的任务相适应。按工计薪的原则必须比以前更严格地遵守，并且应多多注意对突击工人的鼓励，使他们在工作中能发生更大的兴趣。
