　　The Budding of Agricultural Mechanization in China
    A Record of the Harvesting and Exhibition at the Agricultural Mechanization School
          (I)
    From the 18th to the 22nd, the Ministry of Agriculture's Mechanization School was busy with a "great happy event."
    Two towering red flags at the school gate fluttered in the wind, appearing even more magnificent than usual. Guests came and went in a constant stream. From Beijing, from Tong County, from nearby villages, over five days, the school received more than six thousand visitors. Among them were workers, farmers, students, government cadres, and our dear international friends.
    The young and robust students of the Mechanization School enthusiastically led the visitors to see machine harvesting, tractor plowing, the new agricultural implement exhibition, and the picture exhibition. Their faces, tanned by the sun, were always adorned with pleasant and excited smiles.
    In the fields, a self-propelled combine harvester and a tractor-pulled combine harvester were running back and forth. Like skilled barbers shaving the golden wheat fields, the harvesters moved along, shaving off a strip of wheat ten feet wide. After the machine's chewing, the threshed straw, chaff, and dust were sprayed from the rear of the machine, while the golden wheat grains remained in the giant steel belly. Trucks carrying wheat sped across the fields, again and again hauling away the fruits of the harvest pouring from the machines.
    Nimble small horses pulled raking machines, following the harvesters and swiftly gathering the scattered straw into piles. A group of young men and women wearing large straw hats were sorting the straw or gleaning the remaining ears of wheat. They were laughing and singing.
    This "bumper harvest picture" woven from labor, intelligence, and steel appeared for the first time in the fields of the motherland. It signifies that Chinese farmers not only have their own land but are also beginning to master advanced science and technology.
    In the wheat fields that had just been harvested, two tractors pulled "five-furrow plows" and "spring-tooth harrows," speeding along. In an instant, the fertile soil was turned over; in an instant, it was broken up and leveled, waiting to be sown with new seeds to produce another bountiful harvest for the people.

    At the machinery exhibition, rows of new agricultural implements held people spellbound, carefully asking questions and listening to the explanations of the teachers and students of the Mechanization School.
    This is a new type of self-propelled combine harvester that completes cutting, threshing, and cleaning in one operation in the field. Working ten hours a day, it can harvest two to three hundred mu. Only one person is needed to operate this machine.
    This is a "five-furrow plow," which can plow one hundred and twenty mu per day, plowing deeply to eight to ten inches, pressing the stubble and weeds all the way to the bottom of the soil.
    This is a "forty-one-disc plow," which can break up one hundred and fifty mu of soil per day.
    This is a "twenty-four-row drill seeder," which can sow two hundred and forty mu per day.
    There are also three-furrow plows, spring-tooth harrows, various cultivators, harvesters, threshers, seeders, rakes... those pulled by tractors, those pulled by horses, and those pulled by manpower.
    People are most interested in the Stalin 80 diesel tractor, with an engine that can produce up to 93 horsepower, and normally 80 horsepower. It can pull three five-furrow plows at once, or four disc harrows, or six seeders. Think about it! It can plow more than 300 mu of land, harrow 600 mu, and sow more than 1,000 mu in a day. Compared with the small donkeys currently used in our rural areas, how many times will the efficiency of people's labor increase!
    These are all machines from the Soviet Union. We cannot help but pay our heartfelt and lofty respects to the Soviet elder brother.
    When people saw the lightweight sprayer, they couldn't help but cheer for the millions of farmers suffering from insect pests.
    One sprayer can control insects on one to two hundred mu per day. The aphids on the more than 900 mu of cotton fields at the Mechanization School were completely eliminated in a matter of days.
    This machine can be powered by a tractor, pulled by a horse, or pushed by manpower. People are hoping to promote this machine quickly.
  (III)
    In the picture exhibition room, people first noticed the giant portraits of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao side by side, leading hundreds of millions of farmers towards mechanization and collectivization. The huge slogan "Learn from the Soviet Union" indicated the direction of our progress.
    People saw the happy life of Soviet collective farmers and also saw the initial scale of state-owned farms established throughout China. Even more attractive was the teaching life of the teachers and students of the Mechanization School. These young people, mostly from working-class and peasant backgrounds, are learning advanced science and technology with their inherent enthusiasm for labor. Now, they are harvesting the first batch of fruits with their own hands. This is not only a great happy event for these hundreds of teachers and students but also good news for hundreds of millions of people across China.

　　中国农业机械化的萌芽
    记机耕学校的收割和展览会
          （一）
    从十八号到廿二号，农业部机耕学校忙着办了一件“大喜事”。
    校门口两面高耸的红旗迎风飘扬，比平日更显得壮丽。宾客们熙来攘往。从北京来的，从通县来的，从附近村庄来的，五天中这儿接待了六千多名参观者。他们中有工人、有农民、有学生、有机关干部，还有亲爱的国际友人。
    年青的、健壮的机校同学们，热情地带领着参观者去看机器收割、看拖拉机耕地、看新农具展览、看画片展览。他们那被太阳晒得黝黑了的脸庞上，永远挂着愉快的、兴奋的微笑。
    农场上，一部自动联合收割机和一部拖拉联合收割机在来回驰骋。像熟练的理发师在替这金黄的麦地剃头，收割机走过之后，一丈来宽的一片麦被剃去了。经过机器的咀嚼，脱了粒的麦秆、麦壳和灰尘杂物从机器的尾部喷出来，黄澄澄的麦粒留在巨大的钢铁肚子里。运麦的卡车在原野上飞驰，它一次又一次地装走了从机器里倾泻出来的丰收的果实。
    轻快的小马拉着耧草机跟着收割机飞跑，把散落的麦秆一堆一堆地收拾起来。一群带着大草帽的青年男女，在整理着麦秆或清检遗落的麦穗。他们在欢笑，在歌唱。
    这一幅劳力、智慧和钢铁交织的“丰年图”，破天荒地第一次出现在祖国的田野上。它标帜着：中国的农民不但已经有了自己的土地，而且也开始掌握先进的科学技术了。
    刚割完麦子的麦地上，两部拖拉机曳着“五铧犁”和“丁齿耙”在飞跑。顷刻间，肥沃的泥土翻了身，顷刻间又被打碎和整平，期待着播上新的种籽，为人们生产另一季丰硕的果实。
  （二）
    机器展览场上，一排一排的新式农具，人们看得留连忘返，仔细地询问和倾听机校师生们的解说。
    这是新式的自动联合收割机，剪割、脱粒、清选三步工作一道在田间作完，每天工作十小时，可收割二百到三百市亩。操纵这部机器只要一个人。
    这是“五铧犁”，每天耕地一百二十亩，可以深耕到八至十寸，把壳槎、野草全部压到土地底下去。
    这是“四十一片圆盘铧”，每天可以碎土一百五十亩。
    这是“二十四行条播机”，每天播种二百四十市亩。
    还有，三铧犁、丁齿铧、各种中耕机、收割机、脱粒机、播种机、搂草机……用拖拉机带的，用马力拖的，用人力拉的。
    人们最感兴趣的是斯大林八十式柴油拖拉机，引擎最高可发九十三马力，平常八十马力。它一次可以拉上三个五铧犁，或者四个圆盘耙，六个播种机。算一算吧！它一天耕地可达三百多亩，耙地可达六百亩，播种可达一千多亩。和我们农村中目前惯用的小毛驴比一比，人们劳力的效能将增大多少倍！
    这都是来自苏联的机器。我们不能不向苏联老大哥致以亲切的崇高的敬礼。
    当人们看到轻便的喷雾器时，不禁为千千万万苦于虫害的农民欢呼。
    一架喷雾器，每天可以治虫一两百亩。机耕学校九百多亩棉田的蚜虫，几天功夫全部消灭了。
    这个机器，可以用拖拉机带动，可以用马拉，也可以用人力推动。人们期望着赶快推广这种机器。
  （三）
    画片展览室里，人们首先注意的是斯大林大元帅和毛主席并列的巨像，他们携着手领导着几万万农民走向机械化和集体化的道路。“向苏联学习”的巨幅标语，指示了我们前进的方向。
    人们看到了苏联集体农民的幸福生活，也看到了中国各地国营农场初创的规模。更吸引人的，是机耕学校师生的教学生活，这些大部是工农出身的青年，正以他们固有的爱劳动的热情，学习着先进的科学技术。现在，他们亲手收获第一批果实了。这不仅是这几百名师生的大喜事，也是全中国几万万人的喜讯。
