Northeast Daily, Jilin Daily, and Heilongjiang Daily news and correspondent reports combined: After the basic completion of sowing in the fields of Northeast provinces in late May, the first round of hoeing (i.e., weeding) has generally begun. This year, the spring ploughing period in Northeast China was generally shortened by seven to ten days compared with previous years. Coupled with suitable rainfall and uniform growth of grass seedlings, farmers in various places, under the slogans of "planting on the plow, harvesting on the hoe," "if the first hoeing is not timely, the second will never catch up" (meaning that if the first hoeing is not done in time, it will be impossible to catch up later), and "to hoe more times, you must start early," have generally started hoeing early. As of June 1st, Xinjin and Fu counties in the southern part of Liaodong Province had hoeed about one-third of all their fields. In Jilin and Songjiang provinces, most of the stubble land (i.e., land that has been autumn-ploughed or spring-ploughed; stubble refers to the remains of harvested crops) has been hoeed once, and they are simultaneously rushing to replant crops affected by frost damage (Jilin Province has 1.3 million mu) and starting to hoe the un-stubbled land (land that has not been autumn-ploughed or spring-ploughed, where old ridges are used as new furrows during sowing; un-stubbled land is also called turned stubble). Shuangcheng County in Songjiang Province started hoeing on May 28th and hoeed 150,000 mu of fields in three days. During the same period, Yongji County in Jilin Province hoeed more than 270,000 mu of land for the first time, and Shulan County generally started hoeing on May 23rd. The county's 80,000 male and female laborers are intensively engaged in summer hoeing, and more than 100,000 mu of fields have been hoeed. In Jinquan District, Linkou County, Songjiang Province, from June 1st to the 5th, more than 25,000 mu have been hoeed, accounting for more than half of the district's 4,253 hectares of fields. It is estimated that the first round of hoeing will be completed by the 11th of this month. As early as mid-May, when crops had not yet emerged from the soil and weeds had just sprouted, many farmers in Northeast China adopted the advanced farming method of hoeing "sprouts." Land that has been hoeed for "sprouts" grows weeds more slowly and less abundantly, saving labor during subsequent hoeing and allowing for more time. In addition, improved farm tools for summer hoeing are being promoted and used. After 40,000 sets of hoeing machines were distributed throughout Northeast China, some areas (such as Yushu and Shulan in Jilin Province, Shuangcheng in Songjiang, and Keshan in Heilongjiang) have proposed new slogans of "three hoeings and four tilling," and "four hoeings and four tilling." Keshan County promoted 270 "Fumin" weeding machines and 30 "Kenong No. 1" machines. The Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department has loaned 1,100 "United" hoeing machines, which are being distributed. The masses have high enthusiasm for using weeding machines. Most of the mutual aid groups using hoeing machines stated at the county people's congress that they would achieve "four hoeings and four tilling" or "five hoeings and five tilling," and individual groups even made plans for "six hoeings and six tilling." Yanji County in Jilin Province proposed limiting the number of hoeings and tilling, achieving "hoeing whenever there is grass, tilling immediately after hoeing."

To avoid delaying farmers from using them, most of the 40,000 hoeing machines in the region have now been distributed to various villages. Before and during the distribution process, leaders at all levels conducted strict inspections and personally conducted experiments to prove that they met the specifications and were suitable for local use before distributing them to the villages. After the distribution, specific guidance was given to farmers to learn how to use them.

　　东北各省大田提前开锄
    新式改良农具下乡大受欢迎 
    推动群众作出多铲多趟计划
    【本报讯】综合东北日报、吉林日报、黑龙江日报消息及各通讯员报道：东北各省于五月下旬播种基本结束后，已普遍开始铲（即锄）头遍大田。今年东北春耕时期一般比往年缩短七天到十天，加上雨水适宜，草苗齐长，各地农民在“种在犁上，收在锄上”，“头遍铲不及，二遍不赶趟”（意即头遍如果锄得不及时，二遍以后就一直赶不上了），“要想多铲趟（铲即锄；趟即推土，是在锄过以后，用一种牲口或人拉的农具，顺着垅背推一遍，既可保持水分，并可壅一些土到苗跟前，有益小苗生长），必须早动手”等口号下，普遍提前开锄。截至六月一日，辽东省南部之新金、复县已铲完全部大田的三分之一左右。吉林、松江两省耲楂地（即经过秋耕或春耕的地；楂即茬）已大部铲完头遍，正一面突击补种受冻灾的庄稼（吉林省即有一百三十万亩），一面开铲扣楂地（未经过秋耕或春耕的地，播种时以旧垅背作新垅沟；扣楂亦叫翻楂）。松江省的双城县，从五月二十八日开铲，三天中即铲了十五万亩大田。在同一时期中，吉林省永吉县头遍地已铲出二十七万多亩，舒兰县从五月二十三日普遍开铲，全县八万男女劳力，紧张进行夏锄，已铲出大田十万多亩。松江省林口县金山区六月一日开始，至五日已铲出二万五千余亩，达全区大田四千二百五十三垧的一半以上，估计本月十一日全部头遍铲趟即可完成。早在五月中旬，当庄稼尚未出土，杂草刚发出嫩芽之际，东北许多地区不少农民采用了铲“萌生”的进步农作法。凡铲了“萌生”的地，杂草都长得慢而且少，再铲趟时可省工，时间也较充裕。再加上夏锄用的改良农具正在推广使用，全东北四万台铲趟机发下后，已有若干地区（如吉林省的榆树、舒兰，松江的双城，黑龙江的克山等县），提出了“三铲四趟”、“四铲四趟”的新口号。克山县推广了福民号锄草机二百七十台、克农一号机三十台，东北农林部贷到联合号铲趟机一千一百台正在发放。群众对使用锄草机情绪很高。使用铲趟机的互助组，多数在县人民代表会上表示要作到“四铲四趟”或“五铲五趟”，个别组订了“六铲六趟”的计划。吉林省延吉县提出铲趟产限定遍数，做到“有草就铲，铲完就趟”。
    为不误农民不使用，全区四万台铲趟机目前绝大部分已发到各村。在发放前及发放过程中，各级领导干部都进行了严格检查，并亲手进行试验研究，证明确实合乎规格，适于当地使用后再往村里发。发下后，并具体指导农民学会使用方法。
