　　To support the development of private primary and secondary schools in Beijing, and to assist in enriching equipment and strengthening teaching effectiveness within the realm of possibility, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, in accordance with Article 12 of the "Temporary Measures for the Administration of Private Schools in Beijing," has formulated temporary measures for subsidizing private schools. These measures have been submitted to the Municipal People's Government for approval and implementation. The measures stipulate that private schools and vocational supplementary schools in the city that have been registered and meet one of the following two conditions may apply for subsidies: (1) those with sound management and excellent performance but with genuine financial difficulties; (2) those where children of poor workers and peasants account for one-third or more of the total student population in middle schools and two-thirds or more in primary schools, and are difficult to maintain due to low tuition fees. The application time is twice a year, before the end of May and the end of November. The first application this year is changed from June 12th to June 20th. Application procedures: Private middle schools and supplementary schools should directly apply to the Bureau of Culture and Education; private primary schools in urban areas should report through their affiliated central primary schools, and those in suburban areas should report through the cultural and educational section of the district government. After preliminary review and comments, they should be forwarded to the Bureau of Culture and Education. The amount of subsidy is, in principle, limited to no more than one-fourth of the school's total semester expenses; the use of the subsidy is mainly for construction for private secondary schools or vocational supplementary schools, and private primary schools can use it for the purchase of books, instruments, specimens, models, sanitation equipment, etc., and for salary subsidies, depending on the actual situation.
