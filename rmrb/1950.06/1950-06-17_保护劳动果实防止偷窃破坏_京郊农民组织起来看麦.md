　　Protecting the Fruits of Labor and Preventing Theft and Damage
    Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing Organize to Watch the Wheat
    [Report from this newspaper] A wheat protection campaign is now widely underway in villages in the suburbs of Beijing. Under the principle of voluntarism, farmers are establishing wheat protection teams based on natural villages or neighborhoods, or individual wheat farmers are watching their own fields, with neighbors watching each other's fields. In the past, people were hired to watch the crops, and those hired were often unemployed vagrants and local bullies who, under the guise of watching the crops, were actually stealing them. Moreover, there were "gang leaders" colluding with the bao and jia heads to oppress the farmers. The cost of watching the crops was also often shared by middle and poor peasants. As the farmers said, "In the past, protecting the crops meant hiring people to steal from ourselves." This year, the farmers are consciously protecting the fruits of their labor, abolishing the "gang leader" system and unreasonable burdens. In Guanyintang in the eastern suburbs, out of 567 households growing wheat, 516 households, excluding the elderly, weak, poor, and those unable to work, have joined the wheat protection brigade, forming 86 teams. They watch the fields while working in the fields during the day, integrating production and crop protection; at night, each of the seven natural villages has a team, with more than 40 people patrolling and guarding the entire administrative village, a force much larger than hiring people to watch the crops in the past. From now until the wheat harvest is complete, each household will contribute a maximum of three workdays, which the masses are very satisfied with. In order to prevent theft under the guise of gleaning wheat, the village governments are strengthening education for poor peasants, explaining that in the past, the wheat belonged to the landlords, but now it belongs to themselves, and they cannot allow their own people to suffer losses. Houfeng Village has also made a public agreement: gleaning wheat during the day must be organized, and no one is allowed to go to the fields to glean wheat at night. Beixin'an Village in the 19th District, to prevent arson by bad elements when the wheat is piled up in the fields, has decided to assign people to guard the fields day and night and has stipulated that smoking is prohibited in the fields. Families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and orphans and widows lacking labor, are exempt from working in crop protection; after the wheat is ripe, the village will help them with the harvest through substitute farming.

    Furthermore, during the spring vegetable harvest in April and May, dozens of incidents of vegetable theft and damage to wheat seedlings occurred successively in ten villages including Gaobeidian, Xin Si Village, and Maizidian in the eastern suburbs, and seven villages including Jiugong, Xihongmen, and Yinghaizhuang in the southern suburbs. Now that the villages have gradually entered the wheat harvest season, preventing theft, robbery, and damage is even more important. The Beijing Municipal Party Committee's Suburban Committee has instructed the district committees to mobilize Party and League members in each village to assist the government in wheat protection work, and to organize farmers with wheat fields to form crop protection teams on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis to guard the wheat fields. The District Committee and the District Communist Youth League Committee have also mobilized emancipated peasants, Communist Party members, and Communist Youth League members to participate in the public security organizations led by the Public Security Bureau in each village to strengthen public security in the suburbs.

　　保护劳动果实防止偷窃破坏
    京郊农民组织起来看麦
    【本报讯】京郊区各村护麦工作普遍展开。农民在自愿原则下，以自然村或闾为单位，成立护青小组，或由种麦户自看，地邻互看。往年雇人看青，所雇多是无业游民，地痞流氓，名为看青，他们实际上是偷青；并有“青头”把持，与保、甲长相勾结，欺压农民。看青的费用也多由中、贫农分摊。正如农民所说：“往年的护青是让我们雇一批偷自己的人。”今年农民自觉地保卫自己的生产果实，取消了“青头”制度和不合理的负担。东郊观音堂种麦的五百六十七户，除老弱贫苦不能出工者外，有五百一十六户参加了护青大队，共八十六个小组。他们白天一边下地干活，一边看守，生产、护麦两不误；夜晚七个自然村各有一个小组，全行政村共有四十余人巡逻放哨，比过去雇人看青力量大得多。从现在到麦收完毕每户最多出三个工，群众对此很表满意。为了防止借拾麦进行偷窃，各村政府正加强对贫苦农民的教育，说明往年麦子是地主的，现在是自己的，不能叫自己人吃亏。厚俸村并订出公约：白天拾麦要有组织，夜间不许下地拾麦。十九区北辛安村为预防麦子堆在场里被坏分子纵火，决定日夜派人看守场地，并规定禁止在场里吸烟。烈、军属，孤、寡缺乏劳动力者，护麦不出工；麦熟后村里用代耕办法帮助他们收割。

    又讯：京郊于四、五月间春菜成熟之际，东郊高碑店、辛四村、麦子店等十村，及南郊旧宫、西红门、瀛海庄等七村，陆续发生偷窃蔬菜，破坏麦苗事件数十起。现各村已次第进入麦收，防止偷窃、抢劫、破坏更形重要，中共市委郊委会已指示各区区委动员各村党、团员协助政府进行护麦工作，组织有麦地的农民在自愿互利原则下成立看青小组，守护麦田。区委及区团工委并发动翻身农民及共产党员、青年团员参加各村由公安分局领导的治安组织，以加强郊区治安。
