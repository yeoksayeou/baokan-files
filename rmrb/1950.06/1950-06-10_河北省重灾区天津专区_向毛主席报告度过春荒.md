Heavily afflicted Tianjin Special District, Hebei Province
Reports to Chairman Mao on Overcoming the Spring Famine
The lives of disaster victims are guaranteed before the wheat harvest. We will strive to complete the summer harvest, ensure the autumn harvest, and eradicate famine.
[Our Newspaper] Correspondent Kang Guangyu reports: Tianjin Special District in Hebei Province, the area most severely affected by the disaster, has victoriously overcome the famine. Last year, a total of 2,921 villages in the district were affected by the disaster, accounting for 92.7 percent of the total number of villages. The disaster-stricken population was more than 2,318,000, accounting for 83.4 percent of the total population. More than 8,890,000 mu of farmland were flooded, accounting for 82.3 percent of the total planting area, of which more than 6,390,000 mu yielded nothing, and the remaining more than 2,500,000 mu suffered a reduction of 40 to 80 percent. Under these severe circumstances, the broad masses of the special district, under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government, overcame the most difficult seasons of last winter and this spring with extremely tenacious fighting spirit, and victoriously completed the spring plowing and sowing tasks. At present, the wheat harvest is imminent, and the lives of the disaster victims are no longer in danger. The Special Commissioner's Office of the Special District, the CCP District Committee, the Political Department of the Military Sub-district Command, and mass organizations such as the Workers' Union, the Youth League, and the Women's Federation jointly wrote to Chairman Mao to report on the victory over the famine. The original letter is as follows:

Chairman Mao:
First of all, we want to report and reassure you that the people of Tianjin Special District—the area most severely affected by the disaster in Hebei Province—have victoriously overcome the famine under your leadership and support from the Central People's Government and the Provincial Government. We did not ask for a single grain of relief from foreign countries, and in the future, we will not need malicious imperialists to carry out destructive activities in the name of relief. We relied on your correct leadership and that of the Central People's Government, on the efforts of the people, and on our own organizational work to overcome difficulties and complete tasks.
After the previous report (late February) on disaster relief work, we quickly distributed the large amount of relief grain allocated by the central government, exchanging coarse grains for finer grains. Under the highly uplifting and warm feeling of gratitude for your concern, the people of the entire district launched a larger-scale upsurge in handicraft and sideline production. The profits from only a few major productions such as fish, mats, saltpeter, and cloth reached 20 million catties of grain in February and March. Most disaster-stricken households have accumulated three to five dou of grain and, on this basis, have moved into spring plowing and sowing. In the post-disaster period, with extreme shortages of manpower, livestock power, and farm tools, we mobilized more than 80 percent of the labor force to carry out temporary or long-term mutual aid cultivation, overcoming difficulties and completing the spring plowing and sowing tasks. Areas with heavy disasters, large areas, and small populations, such as Ninghe, Baodi, and Jinghai, were also able to avoid leaving land uncultivated. Cotton planting has exceeded the task, completing more than 480,000 mu (the original plan was 450,000 mu), and the general wheat fields have also been hoed twice.
This spring, heavy rains caused disasters, flooding 120,000 mu of wheat fields, and wheat fields also generally and severely suffered from jaundice and various insect pests. We mobilized the masses to actively drain water, and universally implemented pesticide insect control, overcoming or reducing the disasters in the wheat fields.

After the entire district shifted to agricultural production, the savings of the disaster victims were limited, coupled with the consumption of agricultural investment, and sideline handicraft production declined due to unfavorable seasons, causing the lives of the disaster victims to fall into difficulty again. At present, in addition to agricultural production, we have also widely mobilized women and children to gather grass, firewood, and dig vegetables, and they can generally achieve self-sufficiency. At the same time, the income of 80,000 river workers from work-for-relief (in addition to personal consumption, there is still a surplus of 5 million catties of grain), coupled with the support of more than 1 million catties of relief grain that will be distributed soon, can ensure the lives of the disaster victims before the wheat harvest. At present, the broad masses of farmers are actively preparing for the wheat harvest, and we have instructed the Party, government, military, mass organizations, and the people of the entire district to attach importance to the wheat harvest and to be tensely mobilized to carry out the wheat protection and harvesting movement. At present, representatives from all walks of life in various counties and village cadres are gathering in the county to discuss implementation.

We will not be complacent because of this. Because after the wheat harvest, some areas will have no wheat or very little wheat, and other areas will have reduced harvests due to disasters, so the difficulties of the people in summer production are still numerous. But we are determined and confident that, under the leadership of the Central Government and the province, we will actively strive, lead the masses, continue to overcome difficulties, complete summer production, and ensure the autumn harvest, so as to fundamentally eliminate famine.

　　河北省重灾区天津专区
    向毛主席报告度过春荒
    麦收前灾民生活已有保障。将努力完成夏收保证秋收，根绝灾荒。
    【本报讯】通讯员康光宇报导：河北省灾情最严重的天津专区，已胜利度过灾荒。该专区去年受灾村庄共二千九百二十一个，占村庄总数百分之九十二点七。受灾人口二百三十一万八千余人，占人口总数百分之八十三点四。被淹田禾八百八十九万余亩，占总种植面积百分之八十二点三，其中有六百三十九万余亩毫无收成，其余二百五十余万亩则减收百分之四十至八十。在此严重情况下，该专区广大人民经过人民政府的领导扶助，以极度顽强的斗争精神，度过了去冬今春最艰难的季节，并胜利完成了春耕播种任务。目前麦收在即，灾民生活已告无虞。该专区专署、中共地委、军分区司令部政治部以及工、青、妇等群众团体特联合上书毛主席，报告胜利度过灾荒。原信如下：毛主席：
    我们要首先报告并请你放心的是：天津专区——河北省灾情最重的地区——的人民，在你与中央人民政府及省府的领导扶植下，已胜利地度过了灾荒。我们没有要外国一粒粮食的救济，今后更不需要怀有恶意的帝国主义者借救济为名来进行破坏活动。我们是依靠了你和中央人民政府的正确领导，依靠人民的努力与我们自己的组织工作，克服了困难，完成了任务的。
    前次上书报告（二月下旬）救灾工作之后，我们把中央拨给的大批救济粮以粗换细，迅速进行了发放。全区人民在高度振奋与热情感激你的关怀下，更大规模的掀起了手工业、副业生产的热潮，只鱼、席、硝、布等几种主要生产，在二、三月中，即营利达二千万斤粮。大多数灾户，都积蓄到三、五斗粮，并在此基础上转入春耕播种。在灾后，人畜力、农具等极度缺乏的情况下，我们发动了百分之八十以上的劳动力，进行临时的或长期的互助耕作，克服了困难，并已完成了春耕播种任务。宁河、宝坻、静海等灾重地多人少的地区，也能作到不荒土地。植棉已超任务完成四十八万余亩（原计划四十五万亩），一般麦田也已锄过两遍。
    今春大雨成灾，麦田被淹没十二万亩，麦田又普遍严重地发生了黄疸病与各种虫害。我们曾发动群众，积极排水，普遍地实行了药剂除虫，克服或减少了麦田的灾害。
    全区转入农业生产后，因灾民积蓄有限，加之农业投资的消耗，副业手工业生产因季节不利而下降，致使灾民生活又陷于困难。目前我们除农业生产之外，又已广泛发动妇女和儿童打草、拾柴、挖菜，他们一般的可作到自给。同时，八万河工因以工代赈的收入（除本人食用外，尚余五百万斤粮），再加上目前发放将毕的一百余万斤赈粮的支持，麦收前灾民生活已可无虞。现广大农民已在积极的准备麦收，我们已指示全区党、政、军、群众团体及人民群众重视麦收，紧张动员起来，开展护麦收麦运动。现各县各界代表及村干部在县里集会讨论实施。
    我们不会因此自满。因麦收后，一部地区无麦或麦田很少，另一部地区则因受灾歉收，故人民在夏季生产中的困难仍是很多的。但我们有决心与信心，在中央和省的领导下积极努力，带领群众，继续克服困难，完成夏季生产，保证秋收，俾从根本上消灭灾荒。
