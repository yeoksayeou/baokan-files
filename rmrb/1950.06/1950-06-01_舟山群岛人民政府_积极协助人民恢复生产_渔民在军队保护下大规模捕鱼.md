Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 28th: The Zhoushan Archipelago Military Control Commission and the People's Government are actively assisting the islanders in solving their living difficulties and restoring production. The Zhejiang Branch of the China National Grain Corporation is cooperating with the People's Government to supply the islanders with a large amount of grain. The Corporation's Dinghai Office and Shenjiamen and Daishan Distribution Offices were established on the 24th. The first batch of 750,000 jin of rice has arrived in Dinghai and is being sold at low prices. In addition, the Corporation will also supply a large amount of raw oil to the islanders. The East China Aquatic Products Company and the East China Regional Company of the China National Native Produce Company will soon begin purchasing hairtail and other seafood. It is currently the peak fishing season. To assist fishermen in production, the Military Control Commission has dispatched many work teams to register fishing boats and organize production. Fishermen on Daishan Island are actively repairing and drying fishing nets, and some have already gone to sea to fish. The People's Liberation Army stationed on the island has dispatched armed vessels to escort them to prevent pirates. This is the first time in a year that fishermen have fished in large groups under the protection of their own army. Salt farmers in Dinghai are also actively sorting things out to resume work, in order to welcome the upcoming peak production period of sea salt. Many salt farmers have dismantled the robbed salt slabs from the碉堡s built by the Kuomintang bandits in the past and reorganized their old businesses. The Military Control Commission will also establish a "Fishermen and Salt Farmers Work Committee" to lead fishermen and salt farmers in production to overcome the famine.

    【新华社杭州二十八日电】舟山群岛军事管制委员会及人民政府积极协助岛上人民解决生活困难，恢复生产。中国粮食公司浙江分公司正协同人民政府以大批粮食供应岛上人民。该公司定海办事处及沈家门、岱山分销处，已于二十四日成立。首批大米七十五万斤已运抵定海，低价出售。此外，该公司并将有大量生油供应岛上人民。华东水产公司及中国土产公司华东区公司即将开始收购带鱼及其他海产。目前正值鱼汛期间，为协助渔民生产，军管会已派遣许多工作组登记渔船，组织生产，岱山岛渔民积极修补张晒渔网，有些并已下海捕鱼。驻在岛上的人民解放军特派武装船只护航，以防海盗。这是一年来渔民第一次在自己的军队保护下大规模结伙捕鱼。定海盐民也纷纷整理复业，以迎接即将到来的海盐盛产期。不少盐民从过去国民党匪帮所筑的碉堡上拆下被抢去的盐板，重整旧业。军管会并将成立“渔盐民工作委员会”，领导渔盐民生产度荒。
