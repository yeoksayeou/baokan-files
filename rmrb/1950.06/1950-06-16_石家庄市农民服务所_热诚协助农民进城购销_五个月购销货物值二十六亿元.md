    Earnestly Assists Farmers in Entering the City for Purchase and Sale
    Five Months of Goods Purchased and Sold Valued at 2.6 Billion Yuan
    [This newspaper, Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang City Farmers Service Center warmly receives farmers entering the city, assisting them in purchasing and selling goods. Over the past five months, it has made significant achievements in improving urban-rural relations and promoting the exchange of goods, while also saving farmers' food and lodging expenses, earning unanimous praise. The center closely aligns with the interests of farmers, based on their seasonal needs. When handling the purchase and sale of goods, it strictly adheres to the principles of fairness and reasonableness in transaction procedures, buying and selling prices, and weighing, so that farmers trust it sincerely, even to the point of not asking about prices or checking the scales. On average, two to three hundred farmers come to the center daily for buying and selling. According to statistics from January to May, a total of 2.54 billion yuan worth of coarse grains, salt, coal, bran, waterwheel buckets, other agricultural tools, and general merchandise were sold to farmers. A total of 62,844,000 yuan worth of millet, wheat, and ginned cotton were purchased from farmers. Sales accounted for 80 percent of the total transaction volume, greatly expanding the sales business. From January to May, the center received more than 18,800 farmers, with 2,800 large carts and more than 9,500 small carts. Rice alone saved farmers more than 4,700 jin. In addition, housing is free, and bedding costs 200 yuan per item, which is 1.5 jin of rice cheaper per person per night than private hotels. Therefore, considering both food and lodging, farmers saved a total of more than 33,000 jin of rice. (Hou Yuzhen)
    Also: The third branch of the Shijiazhuang City Farmers Service Center is actively expanding its consignment business to meet farmers' needs. Since the branch began consigning iron goods for the Iron Industry Management Office this March, business has become more active, with more than 4,000 waterwheel buckets sold alone. Recently, demand has increased further, and supply is felt to be insufficient. The branch recently reached an agreement with the privately-owned Hengfeng Boiler Factory to promote wide-bodied pots on its behalf. In order not to delay autumn plowing and fertilization, the branch has also entered into a contract with the Second District Supply and Marketing Cooperative to consign fertilizer. Of the first batch of 60,000 jin of sesame seed cakes, more than 20,000 jin have already been loaned and exchanged. The coking plant is currently in negotiations with the branch to entrust it with the consignment of coke fines, priced at approximately 50,000 yuan per ton.

    五个月购销货物值二十六亿元
    【本报石家庄讯】石市农民服务所热诚接待入城农民，帮助购销货物，五个月来对改善城乡关系，促进物资交流，已做出显著成绩，并为广大农民节省了食宿费用，获得一致好评。该所根据农民季节性的需要，密切与农民的利益相结合。办理购销货物时，在交易手续，买卖价格，看称等方面均严守公平合理原则，以致农民推诚相信，甚至可以不问价、不看秤。每日平均有农民二、三百人到该所进行买卖。据一至五月份五个月的统计，共售给农民杂粮、食盐、煤炭、糠面、水车斗及其他农具、杂货等总值达二十五亿四千万元。共收购农民小米、小麦、皮棉总值六千二百八十四万四千元。销货额占交易总额百分之八十，大大扩展了推销业务。该所自一月至五月间，共招待农民一万八千八百余人，来往车辆计大车二千八百辆，小车九千五百多辆。单开饭一项即替农民节省了小米四千七百余斤。另外住房免费，被褥费每条二百元，每人每宿比私人旅店节米一斤半。故就食住两项计，农民共减省三万三千余斤小米。（侯玉珍）
    又：石市农民服务所第三分所为满足农民需要，正积极扩大代销业务。该所自今年三月给铁业经营处代销铁货后，买卖更加活跃，只水车斗一项就卖出四千多个，最近需求更多，已感到供不应求。该所日前与私营恒丰锅厂洽妥，代为推销广锅。为了不误秋耕施肥，该所并与二区供销社订立代销肥料合同，第一批六万斤胡麻饼已贷、换出去二万多斤。炼焦厂最近正与该所洽商委托代销焦末，每吨价约五万多元。
