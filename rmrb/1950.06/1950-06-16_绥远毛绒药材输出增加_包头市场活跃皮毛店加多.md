Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, June 14th: The output of native products such as wool, furs, and medicinal materials in Suiyuan Province is increasing daily. Taking wool as an example, according to incomplete statistics, the output from Baotou and Gui Sui alone reached over 10 million catties in the four and a half months from January to May 15th this year.

Wool produced in Suiyuan Province occupies an important position in the country. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, its output accounted for more than half of the country's total wool output at its peak, and it was very popular in the international market. Subsequently, due to the destruction of animal husbandry by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, as well as the blockage of foreign transportation, exports stagnated, production sharply declined, and the wool market also became depressed. In 1939, the amount of wool on the market in Gui Sui and Baotou decreased by 96.6% compared to 1933. The amount on the market from January to October last year was only 3 million catties, which was only equal to the amount in the two months from November to the end of the year after liberation.

After the liberation of Suiyuan Province, professional companies in various places appropriately increased the price of wool and purchased it in large quantities. At the same time, in coordination with supply and marketing cooperatives, they organized the exchange of industrial products for wool, so that the exchange price between the two gradually became reasonable. The People's Bank also handled export usance and purchase loans in the producing areas, encouraging private merchants to go deep into the producing areas to purchase, which stimulated the export of wool and other native products and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. In Baotou, a distribution center for wool in the Northwest, the exchange rate for 100 catties of Xining wool was 1.7 bolts of cloth in the past. In January of this year, the fur company increased it to 3.8 bolts, and in April it was further increased to 4.2 bolts. As a result, the local market is unusually active, and the number of fur shops has increased from 29 before liberation to 45. Many merchants from Tianjin, Beijing and other places come to Baotou.

### 绥远毛绒药材输出增加  包头市场活跃皮毛店加多

　　绥远毛绒药材输出增加
    包头市场活跃皮毛店加多
    【新华社归绥十四日电】绥远省毛绒、药材等土产输出量日益增加。以毛绒为例，据不完全统计，今年一月至五月十五日四个半月中，仅包头、归绥两市所输出的即达一千余万斤。
    绥远省所产毛绒在全国占重要地位，在抗日战争前输出量最高时占全国毛绒输出量的半数以上，在国际市场上很受欢迎。其后由于日寇及国民党匪帮对于牧畜业的破坏，以及对外交通阻塞，出口停滞，产量锐减，毛绒市场亦因而萧条。一九三九年归绥、包头两市上市毛绒较一九三三年减少百分之九十六点六。去年一月到十月上市数量仅三百万斤，仅等于解放后十一月到年底两个月的数量。
    绥远全省解放后，各地专业公司曾适当提高毛绒价格，大量收购；同时配合供销合作社，组织工业品换购毛绒，使两者交换价格渐趋合理。人民银行又办理出口押汇与产区采购贷款，鼓励私商深入产区收购，这样就刺激了毛绒及其他土产出口和城乡物资的交流。为西北毛绒集散地的包头市，过去每百斤西宁毛换市布一点七匹，今年一月，皮毛公司提高到三点八匹，四月又增加为四点二匹。因之该地市场异常活跃，皮毛店已由解放前二十九家增加到四十五家。津、京等地来包客商极多。
