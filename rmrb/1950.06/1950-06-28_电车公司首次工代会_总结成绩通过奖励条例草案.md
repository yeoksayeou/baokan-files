　　Tram Company Holds First Workers' Congress
    Summarizes Achievements, and Passes Draft Reward Regulations
    [This Newspaper Reported] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The Beijing Tram Company held its first session of the first Workers' Representative Conference on the 24th and 25th of this month. In addition to the 53 worker representatives, 20 outstanding veteran workers and 14 workers who made significant contributions to innovation and technological improvement were also invited to attend. The conference heard work reports from the company's Management Committee and the Trade Union, discussed and approved the draft reward regulations for the tram company; and unanimously passed letters to Chairman Mao, Mayor Nie Rongzhen, and Chairman Peng Zhen of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, responding to Chairman Mao's call at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to strive for a fundamental improvement in the nation's financial and economic situation, ensure the overfulfillment of this year's production plan, and create more wealth for the country.
    To carry out the New Record Movement successfully, there must be a sound reward system. Based on the principles of more pay for more work and considering both public and private interests, the company's Management Committee formulated a draft reward regulation. This regulation was developed by the Management Committee after collecting the opinions of the workers and studying them by the Awarding Committee, and then submitted to the Representative Conference.
    After careful and full discussion in the representatives' groups, both reports and the draft reward regulations were unanimously supported, and it was guaranteed that they would be brought back to the masses for in-depth dissemination and implementation. The representatives also put forward many opinions on how to carry out the New Record Movement. Representatives of the trolleybus route put forward 19 suggestions to the administration, requesting the establishment of unified leadership, clear responsibilities, and the establishment of driver operating rules; and 14 suggestions to the trade union, requesting the trade union to go deep into the masses, genuinely face production, and improve the working system. They also put forward their own goals: to eliminate accidents, attract more passengers, ensure on-time operation, save electricity, and create a new record of 10,000 kilometers of safe driving. Workers in the repair shop, power plant, civil engineering department, power supply department, and business departments all put forward ways to do a good job in the New Record Movement and made guarantees. The worker representatives of the repair shop guaranteed that the annual production plan would be completed three months ahead of schedule (the original plan was to complete the construction of 18 new cars by the end of August, which has been completed ahead of schedule on June 25). The representatives of the civil engineering department expressed that the replacement of rails would be increased from three sections to five sections per day, ensuring no rework within three years; the representatives of the power supply department expressed that they would strive to avoid power outages and disconnections, and implement a segmented responsibility system; the representatives of the power plant expressed that they would strive to reduce the cost of coal consumption per kilowatt-hour by 1.1 kilograms. Based on these opinions, the presidium of the conference compiled more than 50 proposals on "How to Carry Out the New Record Movement," which were unanimously approved by all the representatives.

    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：京市电车公司于本月廿四、二十五日举行第一届第一次职工代表会议。会议除有职工代表五十三人出席外，还邀请优秀的老年职工二十人和在创造发明、改进技术上贡献较大的职工十四人列席参加。会议听取了该公司管委会和工会的工作报告，讨论与通过了电车公司奖励条例草案；并一致通过给毛主席、聂荣臻市长、市总工会彭真主席写信，响应毛主席在中共三中全会的号召，为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争，保证超额完成今年生产计划，给国家创造更多的财富。
    要搞好新纪录运动必须有健全的奖励制度，该公司管委会本着多劳多得、公私兼顾的原则，制定了奖励条例草案，这项条例是管委会事前集中了工人群众意见，又经评奖委员会研究，然后向代表会议提出的。
    经过代表们小组认真充分讨论，一致拥护两项报告和奖励草案，保证带回群众中去深入传达贯彻执行。代表们并对怎样开展新纪录运动提出许多意见。车路代表向行政提出十九条建议，要求车路建立统一领导、职责分明、定出司机运行规则等；向工会提出十四条建议，要求工会深入群众、切实面向生产、健全工作制度等。他们还提出自己的奋斗目标：消灭事故、争取更多乘客、保证行车正点、节约电流、创造安全行车一万公里新纪录。修造厂、发电厂、土木课、供电课、以及业务部门职工都提出了搞好新纪录的办法，并提出了保证。修造厂的职工代表保证全年生产计划提前三个月完成（原计划八月底完成造新车十八辆，已提前于六月二十五日完成）。土木课的代表表示修铁轨争取由每天换三节改为换五节，保证三年内不反工；供电课代表表示争取不停电、不断线，实行分段负责制；发电厂代表表示争取降低每度燃煤一·一公斤的成本。会议主席团根据这些意见，整理成“怎样开展新纪录”的提案五十余条，获得全体代表一致通过。
