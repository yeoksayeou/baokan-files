　　Hengyang Railway Bureau Affiliated Units
    Launch Production Emulation Drive
    Guarantee Task Completion and Strive to Eliminate Accidents
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Changjiang Daily News: Workers of all units under the Hengyang Railway Administration are enthusiastically responding to the "July 1st" production emulation campaign. In this campaign, the first requirement is to break through the current backward production level, strive to eliminate accidents, implement democratic factory management, and formulate work discipline systems to overcome the past chaos and disorganization in production. Hengyang Station has established a merit recording system and drawn up a form using a locomotive to represent progress. If any team has an accident, the locomotive will return to the starting point, and on "July 1st" a comparison will be made to see whose locomotive has run the furthest ahead. The Hengyang Transportation Section has formed the "People's" chartered train group, aiming to learn from the Northeast model train "Masses'." It also guarantees the effective implementation of the master-apprentice contract movement, training eighty-four transportation, freight car, baggage, switch, and station personnel before "July 1st." All units of the Guangzhou Railway Sub-bureau have universally established production competition committees, striving to establish democratic management committees before June 20th. Contracts have been established between units, systems have been established, business inspections have been strengthened, and accidents will be resolutely eliminated. The red flag competition has reached a climax in the stations under the jurisdiction of the Changsha Transportation Section; all station employees and teams have formulated merit evaluation standards, paying special attention to eliminating accidents. Since the inspection section launched the competition in May, the A-level inspection of passenger and freight cars has exceeded the task. Workers of the Wuchang Transportation Section and Locomotive Section have also established plans and launched challenges, guaranteeing the elimination of accidents and improving production quality.

    展开生产立功竞赛
    保证完成任务·争取消灭事故
    【本报讯】据长江日报消息：衡阳铁路管理局各单位职工，热烈响应迎接“七一”生产立功竞赛运动。在此次运动中，首先要求突破现在落后的生产水平，争取消灭事故，贯彻工厂管理民主化，制订工作纪律制度，以克服过去生产上的混乱和无组织状态。衡阳车站已建立记功制度，并画出表格，用火车头表示进度，那一组发生事故，火车头就退回起点去，到“七一”时比较谁的车头跑在最前面。衡阳车务段组成了“人民号”包车组，要向东北模范列车“群众号”看齐。并保证切实推行师徒合同运动，在“七一”前培养八十四名运输、货车、行李、转辙、站务等人员。广州铁路分局各单位，已普遍建立生产竞赛委员会，争取在六月二十日以前成立民主管理委员会。各单位间已订立了联系合同，建立了制度，加强业务检查，坚决消灭事故。长沙车务段所辖各站，争红旗运动已达高潮；车站全体员工及各小组拟定了评功标准，特别注意消灭事故。检车段自五月展开竞赛后，甲检客、货车已超额完成任务。武昌车务段、机务段职工亦纷纷订立计划，展开挑战，保证消灭事故，提高生产质量。
