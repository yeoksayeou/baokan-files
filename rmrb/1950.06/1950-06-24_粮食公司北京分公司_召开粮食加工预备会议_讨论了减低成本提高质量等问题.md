　　Beijing Branch of the Grain Company
    Holds Preparatory Meeting on Grain Processing
    Discussing Issues Such as Reducing Costs and Improving Quality
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Under the guidance of the Beijing Municipal Financial and Economic Committee and the Commerce Bureau, the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Grain Company convened a preparatory meeting for the National Grain Processing Conference on the 22nd and 23rd of this month, following the instructions of the Central Ministry of Trade. The meeting discussed issues related to the production and sales of flour in Beijing, cost accounting, processing profits, and the manufacturing specifications of "August 1st" flour. It plans to systematically organize the materials and opinions from the meeting on these issues and submit them to the upcoming National Grain Processing Conference for discussion.

    The meeting unanimously agreed that the current flour production in Beijing has become excessive, and how to reduce costs, improve quality, and expand sales channels is a major issue. Currently, there are 27 mechanized flour mills and 33 semi-mechanized flour mills in Beijing, with a total of 170 electric mills. The monthly flour production can reach 540,000 bags. If the 39 electric mills that public and private flour mills plan to add are included, the future production capacity could reach a maximum of 740,000 bags per month. However, according to statistics from January to May of this year, the actual monthly output was 420,000 bags, with approximately 80,000 bags coming from other regions, while sales were only 400,000 bags. Based on the current production capacity, it is already excessive. In addition, regarding the manufacturing specifications of "August 1st" flour, the current system is based on quantity, meaning that regardless of the type of wheat, 81 jin of flour are milled from 100 jin of wheat. Due to the varying quality of different types of wheat, the flour quality also varies, which affects sales. Therefore, there should be uniform national regulations on quality standards. The meeting discussed these issues, as well as other issues related to public-private relations, and will provide these specific opinions for the National Grain Processing Conference to consider.

    More than 20 representatives from units such as the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee, the Commerce Bureau, the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Grain Company, the Industry Bureau, the Enterprise Company, the Mechanized Flour Industry Association, and the Rice and Flour Grain Industry Association attended this preparatory meeting.

　　粮食公司北京分公司
    召开粮食加工预备会议
    讨论了减低成本提高质量等问题
    【京市新闻处讯】中国粮食公司北京市公司根据中央贸易部的指示，在京市财经委员会及商业局领导下，于本月二十二、二十三两日召开了全国粮食加工会议北京市预备会议，讨论有关京市面粉产销，成本计算及加工利润，“八一”粉制造规格等问题；并准备将会议对这些问题的材料及意见有系统的整理后，提交即将召开的全国粮食加工会议讨论。
    会议一致认为目前京市面粉生产已形过剩，如何减低成本、提高质量、打开销路是一个主要问题。京市机制面粉业目前共有二十七家，半机制面粉业有三十三家，共有电磨一百七十部，月产面粉量可达五十四万袋，如加上公私粉厂准备增设的三十九部电磨，则将来生产能力每月最高时可达七十四万袋。但根据今年一至五月份统计，每月实际产量四十二万袋，外地来粉约八万余袋，而销量则仅四十万袋，按目前生产力已形过剩。此外，如“八一”粉的制造规格，目前系按量规定，即不论何种麦子都是一百斤磨八十一斤面粉，由于各种麦的品质不一，粉质也有好坏，因此影响销路，所以对质量上的标准全国应有统一规定。会议对这些问题以及其他有关公私关系等问题都作了讨论，将把这些具体意见提供全国粮食加工会议参考。
    出席这次预备会议的有：市财委会、商业局、中国粮食公司北京市公司、工业局、企业公司、机制面粉业公会、米面粮业公会等单位代表共二十余人。
