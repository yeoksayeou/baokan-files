　　Fuhua Explosion Incident Relief Committee
　　Decides on Three Measures to Aid Victims

　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Fuhua Firecracker Factory explosion incident relief committee has recently decided on the following three relief measures:

　　(1) Relief for affected citizens: ① Those injured and sent to the hospital will have all medical expenses covered by the government, to be handled by the relief committee; ② All victims who have relatives or friends in the city or elsewhere can receive a portion of relief funds to settle down, in order to restore their lives and businesses; ③ Widows, widowers, the elderly, and those without labor power and without reliable relatives or friends will be taken in by the government; ④ Those who have relatively strong labor power and can immediately resume production will be provided with low-interest or interest-free loans or a portion of relief to enable them to quickly resume production.

　　(2) House repair measures: ① For those that can still be repaired, the garrison troops will assist with manpower, and the government will subsidize a portion of the material purchase costs or invite carpenters, bricklayers, and other technical personnel to participate in the repair. The remainder will be handled by the residents themselves. The amount of the subsidy will be determined by the street leaders and district government based on the degree of damage; ② For those that cannot be repaired at all, the government will subsidize the construction of temporary shelters or open sheds; ③ Those who have the ability to repair themselves will be assisted with manpower by the garrison troops or by the government in the form of work relief; ④ Agency housing will be resolved by the respective agencies themselves.

　　(3) Regarding taxes: The disaster area can be given appropriate tax reductions, exemptions, or deferrals. Specific measures will be determined by the street leaders and district government after investigation.

　　All measures will be implemented after the municipal government investigates the specific situation within one or two days.
