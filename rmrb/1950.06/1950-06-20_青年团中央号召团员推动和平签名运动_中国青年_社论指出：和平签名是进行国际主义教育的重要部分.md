　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League has issued an instruction on widely launching the peace signature campaign, calling on youth league committees at all levels to further widely and deeply carry out propaganda work among youth league members and the youth masses, and mobilize more than 2.1 million youth league members, all students in school, and the vast number of young workers, farmers, shop assistants, staff members, workers, teachers, etc. throughout the country to enthusiastically sign the peace declaration to express the will and determination of the broad masses of Chinese youth to support world peace. The instruction stipulates that in places where there are branches of the China Association to Defend World Peace, the Youth League should carry out the signature campaign under the auspices of the branch. In places where no such branch organization has been established, the Youth League should be responsible for carrying out this work jointly with various people's organizations. The instruction calls on every youth league member to not only sign the declaration themselves, but also to carry out vivid propaganda among the unorganized masses as much as possible, so that everyone who loves peace can understand the significance of this movement and sign the peace declaration.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The "China Youth," the organ of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, published an editorial in its 41st issue entitled "Youth League Members Should Enthusiastically Respond to the World Peace Signature Campaign," calling on Youth League members to launch the peace signature campaign. The editorial pointed out: The significance of the peace signature campaign lies in showing that the force supporting world peace is very great; hundreds of millions of people around the world are signing their names to demand peace and demand the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons. This tells the imperialists that whoever dares to launch a war is the enemy of hundreds of millions of people around the world! The editorial said that all people who love peace and democracy, seeing that they have such a powerful force, will be more confident in their struggle against aggressive war and for lasting peace. In particular, the people of oppressed nations and the people who love peace and democracy in capitalist countries will feel that their struggle is not isolated, but is closely linked with the struggle of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union against imperialism. The editorial called on Youth League members to conduct in-depth propaganda, organize the masses to sign their names, and regard the propaganda of this signature campaign as an important part of conducting internationalist education.

    “中国青年”社论指出：和平签名是进行国际主义教育的重要部分
    【新华社十七日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会顷发出关于广泛展开和平签名运动的指示，号召各级团委进一步广泛和深入地在青年团员和青年群众中进行宣传工作，动员全国二百十余万团员、一切在校的学生及广大的青年工人、农民、店员、职员、工作人员、教员等都踊跃地在和平宣言上签名。以表示中国广大青年拥护世界和平的意志和决心。指示规定：凡在有中国保卫世界和平大会分会的地方，青年团应在分会的主持下进行签名运动，在未设该会分会组织的地方，青年团即应负责与各人民团体共同进行此项工作。指示号召每个青年团员，除自己签名外，还要尽量在无组织的群众中进行生动的宣传，使每个爱好和平的人都了解这个运动的意义，并在和平宣言上签名。
    【新华社十七日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会机关刊物“中国青年”第四十一期发表题为“青年团员要热烈响应世界和平签名运动”的社论，号召青年团员展开和平签名运动。社论指出：和平签名运动的意义就在于表明拥护世界和平的力量是很大的；全世界成万万的人签名要求和平，要求无条件禁止原子武器，这就告诉帝国主义者，谁敢发动战争，谁就是全世界成万万人的敌人！社论说，一切爱好和平民主的人民，看到了自己有这样强大的队伍，将更增加为反对侵略战争、争取持久和平而斗争的信心，尤其是被压迫民族的人民和资本主义国家内爱好和平民主的人民，他们更会由此感到自己的斗争不是孤立的，是和以苏联为首的世界和平阵营反对帝国主义斗争密切结合的。社论号召青年团员进行深入的宣传，组织群众签名，把这次签名运动的宣传作为进行国际主义教育的重要部分。
