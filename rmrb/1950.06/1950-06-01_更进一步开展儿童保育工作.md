　　Further Develop Childcare Work
　　Kang Keqing
    The childcare undertaking of New China is gradually growing from scratch, from small to large, and from old to new. As of mid-May this year, according to incomplete statistics from twenty-seven major provinces and cities across the country, there are already 541 public and private childcare institutions, caring for over 35,000 children. This is the foundation of New China's childcare undertaking.

    However, today, the childcare undertaking of New China is still just a newly sprouted seedling, and it must rely on our long-term and arduous cultivation to gradually grow stronger.

    Childcare is not only an important component of children's work and women's work, but also an important task related to the construction of New China and the health of the Chinese nation. Past experience has proven that factories and institutions that have established childcare facilities have appropriately resolved the difficulties of some mothers with children, which can increase the number of people participating in production and work, and improve the mood and efficiency of production and work. For example, Xu Fengying, a female worker at the Dalian Fishing Net Factory, could only weave 30 meshes of net per day when she took care of her child herself. After sending her child to the nursery last year, her output greatly increased, and she could weave 80 meshes a day, and later increased to more than 100 meshes, and was selected as the factory's labor model. This is a very significant example. Conversely, some institutions and factories have not adequately helped parents solve the difficulties of childcare, which not only affects the parents' production mood, but also makes some mothers have to leave their jobs or production posts for a long or short period of time, more or less affecting the completion of the entire work task and production task. Also, because of the establishment of these childcare institutions, many children of the working people who could not get proper care from their parents in the past are now getting more reasonable care and education in the nurseries, so that many physically and mentally unhealthy children are gradually developing healthily.

    Therefore, in cities, we must try our best to establish various childcare institutions (such as breastfeeding rooms, mutual aid for childcare, nurseries, kindergartens, etc.) in factories and institutions, and further serve the children of the broad masses of manual and mental laborers. When running childcare institutions in factories or institutions, we must first proceed from the current social and people's living standards and economic capacity, adapt to the needs and possibilities of the people, and use this as a standard to determine the location of the nursery, childcare time, children's living standards, and staffing. We should also use this as a basis to overcome difficulties through our own efforts, appropriately apply scientific childcare methods, cultivate good living habits for children, enlighten children's intelligence, improve children's lives, and promote children's health.

    As for whether to run full-day or night childcare institutions, or day or night half-day childcare institutions, it should be decided according to the manpower, financial resources, parental needs, and children's interests of various institutions, factories, and relevant parties, and should adapt to the possibilities and needs of the time and place. We should run various types of childcare institutions, such as full-day, half-day, breastfeeding rooms, seasonal nurseries, and mutual aid childcare organizations, etc., and strive to use the existing material conditions to help parents solve the difficulties of raising children and serve more children. Some childcare workers and mothers now believe that only by running full-day nurseries can the needs of parents be fully met and children be reasonably cared for and educated. Therefore, some places concentrate their limited manpower and financial resources to solve the difficulties of a few parents and serve a few children, so that the vast majority of children who need and want to enter childcare institutions cannot get the opportunity to be cared for. We believe that in the current situation, it is generally advisable to advocate running half-day care. First of all, half-day care is more economical in terms of manpower and financial resources. It is easier to set up a half-day nursery attached to a factory or institution than to build a full-day nursery, and it can use existing manpower and financial resources to serve more children. Secondly, because in the half-day nursery, children can receive scientific, reasonable, and collective care and education during the parents' working hours; when the parents are resting, the children return home and can also receive the love of their parents, and can enjoy the dual benefits of scientific childcare methods and parental love, which are necessary conditions for the healthy development of children's physical and mental health, and which cannot be fully achieved by today's full-day nurseries. Of course, there are also difficulties in running half-day care, but compared with full-day care, there are fewer difficulties and more benefits. At present, many full-day nurseries have helped solve the difficulties of mothers who are very busy with work, and have also provided reasonable care and education for children who are far away from or have lost their parents, which is an achievement. In the future, under the conditions that manpower and financial resources permit, in order to meet the above two requirements, exemplary full-day care can also be run; however, it must adapt to the children's psychology, give maternal love from all aspects, parents should visit their children more often, and childcare workers should better study their business and appropriately meet the children's requirements to supplement the shortcomings of full-day care.

    In order to improve the health of rural children, in today's rural areas, we should first popularize maternal and child health education, oppose superstition and unsanitary childcare methods, and advocate new methods of childbirth and childcare that farmers can do, in order to reduce the mortality rate of children. For example, in the second half of last year, nineteen counties in the Northeast region opened a total of fifty-two training classes for old midwives, so that two thousand six hundred and seventy-nine old-style midwives received maternal and child health and new methods of childbirth education. This will play a considerable role in promoting maternal and child health work in rural areas. Secondly, we should publicize to parents to improve the methods of educating children. In the past, due to the influence of the feudal patriarchal system, and due to the pain of parents' poverty, children were often used as "punching bags," beating and scolding children, abusing children, and treating boys and girls differently. We should persuade parents to consciously correct these bad habits left over from the feudal system. During the busy farming season, we can adapt to the needs and possibilities of production and help rural working women with children solve the difficulties of participating in production. When conditions are ripe, we can also focus on piloting collective childcare institutions, such as mutual aid childcare and nurseries during the busy farming season. However, it must be based on the principle of voluntariness and need, and must not be forced to implement.

    To run childcare well, in addition to relying on the support of the people's government, we must get the cooperation of parents and the support of enthusiastic people in the society. Parents should clearly recognize their responsibility for raising and educating their children, so that they become excellent children of New China, and they should especially set an example, loyally serving the country and the people, as a model for children. Therefore, parents should take a particularly active and cooperative attitude towards the emerging childcare undertaking, so that it can gradually develop. Enthusiastic people in the society who are enthusiastic about children's work should give strong support, contribute money and efforts to create children's welfare institutions, and serve the children.

    We believe that the childcare undertaking of New China will gradually develop, and its future is unlimited. Our childcare workers must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, transform our thinking and improve our work, and unite with all enthusiastic people in the society who support the childcare undertaking to strive for the development of the childcare undertaking.

### 更进一步开展儿童保育工作

　　更进一步开展儿童保育工作
    康克清
    新中国的儿童保育事业，是从无到有、从小到大、从旧到新地逐渐生长起来的。截至今年五月中为止，根据全国二十七个重要省市的不完全统计已经有公私立保托机关五百四十一处，受托儿童三万五千余人，这是新中国保育事业的初基。
    但是，在今天，新中国的儿童保育事业还只是新生的嫩芽，必须依靠着我们长期艰苦地培育，才能逐渐地壮大起来。
    儿童保育事业不仅是儿童工作和妇女工作中的重要组成部分，而且是有关于新中国建设事业和中华民族健康的一项重要工作。过去的经验证明，凡是举办了保托机构的工厂和机关，适当地解决了一部分有孩子的母亲的困难，就能增加参加生产和工作的人员，提高生产和工作的情绪与效率。例如大连渔网工厂女工徐凤英，过去自己带孩子时，每天只能织三十扣网，去年把孩子送进托儿所后，产量大为增加，一天能织八十扣，后来一直增到一百扣以上，被选为该厂的劳动模范。这就是很显著的例证。相反的，有些机关和工厂，没有适当的帮助父母解决保育孩子的困难，不仅影响了父母的生产情绪，而且使得有些母亲就不能不因此而长期地或短期地离开工作或生产岗位，或多或少地影响了整个工作任务与生产任务的完成。也由于举办了这些保托机构，使很多过去得不到父母适当保育的劳动人民子弟，今天在托儿所得到了比较合理的保教，使许多身心不健康的儿童，逐渐获得健全的发展。
    因此，在城市中，我们要尽可能地在工厂和机关中举办各种各样的保托机构（如哺乳室、变工互助带孩子、托儿所、保育院等等），更进一步为广大体力劳动者、脑力劳动者的子女服务。办理工厂的或机关的保托机构时，首先必须从今天社会和人民的生活水平、经济能力出发，适应人民的需要与可能，以此为标准，来决定托儿所的地址、保托时间、儿童生活标准及人员的配备等问题。也以此为基础，用自己的努力，来克服困难，适当地运用科学的保育方法，养成儿童良好的生活习惯，启发儿童的智慧，改善儿童的生活，增进儿童的健康。
    至于举办应当举办日夜全托或者办日间或夜间的半托的保托机构，应该根据各机关、工厂及有关各方面的人力、财力、父母的需要、子女的利益来决定，而应适应当时当地的可能与需要，举办各种各样的托儿机构，例如全托、半托、哺乳室、季节性托儿所、以及互助变工带孩子的组织等等，力求运用现有的物质条件，更多地帮助父母解决扶育孩子的困难，为更多的孩子们服务。现在有些保育工作者和母亲们，认为只有举办全托托儿所，才能圆满地满足父母的需要，合理的保教儿童。因此，有些地方就把仅有的人力财力，集中解决少数父母的困难，为少数孩子服务，使绝大部分需要和愿意进保托机构的孩子，得不到保养的机会。我们认为在目前的情况下，一般来说，以提倡举办半托为宜。首先是因为半托比较节省人力、财力。在工厂、机关附设一个半托托儿所，比建立一个全托托儿所要容易些，能运用现有的人力、财力为更多的孩子服务。其次因为半托托儿所，在父母工作的时间内，孩子们可以受到科学的、合理的、集体的保教；在父母休息时间，孩子回到家里，又可以得到父母的爱抚，能兼得科学的保育方法及父爱母爱的双重好处，这是儿童身心健全发展所必须的条件，也是今天全托托儿所不能完全办到的。当然举办半托也有困难，但与全托比较，困难少而好处多。现在有不少全托的托儿所，一方面帮助解决了工作十分繁忙的母亲的困难，另一方面又使因父母远离或丧失父母的孩子，得到了合理的保教，这是有成绩的。今后，在人力财力可能的条件下，为了满足上述两种要求，也可举办示范性的全托；但是必须适应儿童的心理，从各方面给予母爱的陶冶，父母应多多探望孩子，儿童工作者应更好地研究业务，适当地满足孩子的要求，补充全托的不足。
    为着增进农村儿童的健康，在今天农村里，首先应普及妇婴卫生教育，反对迷信及不卫生的保育方法，提倡农民可能办到的新法接生，新法带孩子，以减少儿童的死亡率。例如去年下半年度东北地区十九个县，共开办旧产婆训练班五十二期，使二千六百七十九个旧式产婆受到妇婴卫生，新法接生的教育。这对于推进农村中的妇婴卫生工作，将起相当大的作用。其次应该向父母宣传，改进对孩子的教育方法，过去由于封建家长制的影响，由于父母贫穷的痛苦，往往把子女当“出气筒”，打骂子女，虐待子女，以及对男孩子和女孩子的不同待遇，对于这些封建制度遗留下来的坏习惯，更应说服父母，使他们自觉的改正。在农忙的季节，可以适应生产的需要与可能，帮助有孩子牵累的农村劳动妇女解决参加生产的困难。在条件成熟时，也可有重点的试办集体保托孩子的机构，如变工互助看孩子，及农忙托儿所等等。但是必须根据自愿与需要的原则，千万不能强迫推行。
    要办好保育事业，除掉依靠人民政府的扶持外，必须得到父母的合作与社会热心人士的支持，做父母的应明确认识对于子女有抚养和教育的责任，使之成为新中国优秀的儿女，尤应以身作则，忠诚地为国家、为人民服务，做为儿童的榜样。所以，父母们对于新兴的保育事业，特别应该采取积极协助的态度，使之逐步的开展。社会上热心儿童工作的人士，更应大力支持，出钱出力创办儿童福利机构，为儿童服务。
    我们相信，新中国的儿童保育事业将要逐步开展，其前程是无限的。我们保育工作者，必须学习苏联的先进的经验，改造思想改进工作，与一切赞助儿童保育事业的社会热心人士，团结一致，为开展儿童保育事业而奋斗。
