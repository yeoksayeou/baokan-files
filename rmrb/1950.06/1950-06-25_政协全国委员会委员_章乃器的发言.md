    Speech by Zhang Naiqi, Member of the National Committee of the CPPCC

    Chairman, fellow committee members, ladies and gentlemen:
    I would like to express some shallow opinions on the land reform issue.
    Vice Chairman Liu’s report and the draft Land Reform Law proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China are both faithful to the implementation of the Common Program and fully adapted to the current new situation. The Common Program solemnly stipulates the boundary between the four friends and the three enemies at the outset. This boundary is strictly delineated in this bill, without any ambiguity. However, because we have established a nationwide and highly efficient regime, and our focus has shifted to production and construction, this is a new situation. Under this new situation, we must and can carry out land reform in a more orderly manner, preventing the occurrence of those undesirable chaotic states; we must and can more effectively ensure the restoration and development of productive forces, without suffering undue damage. The preservation of the rich peasant economy and the relatively lenient measures taken towards landlords can only be explained in this way. If it is believed that this is a compromise to the landlord class, then it is completely wrong. This right-leaning idea should be clarified to avoid shaking the foundation of the people's democratic united front.
    First of all, the so-called "more orderly" order must refer to revolutionary order, which is different from the "rule of law" spoken of by scholars in the old days. It must be the peasant masses rising up to carry out land reform themselves under the national laws and government leadership, rather than simply relying on top-down administrative measures. Laws and government leadership must pay attention to mobilizing the strength of the peasants from bottom to top, inspiring their initiative and consciousness, and combining land reform work to better organize the peasants, making them an important foundation of the new state, and should never restrict the consciousness and initiative of the peasants. (Laws can only be a means of leading peasants, mobilizing peasants, and organizing peasants.) This is a truth, a truth proven by the great victories of the past revolution. It should no longer be doubted. Those ideas that fear the rise of the peasants must absolutely no longer exist.
    Secondly, the role of preserving the rich peasant economy, as Chairman Mao has instructed us, is "to facilitate the early restoration of rural production, to isolate landlords, protect middle peasants, and protect small landowners." It is very clear that the basic force of land reform work must rely on poor and hired peasants to unite with middle peasants, while rich peasants are only a necessary component for restoring production. Therefore, if it is believed that we can shift the focus of peasant organization to the rich peasants, and we can despise the poor and hired peasants, then it is obviously completely wrong. We need to neutralize the rich peasants, but for the time being, we can only achieve the neutralization of the rich peasants. The provision in the bill that prohibits rich peasants from joining peasant associations is completely correct, otherwise, it is very likely that the rich peasants will obtain the leadership of the peasant associations, thereby eliminating land reform. Politically, it will also make the poor and hired peasants blur their class consciousness, and even shake their faith in the new regime, which will hinder the major principle of "basing on the worker-peasant alliance," and the harm will be even greater.
    Thirdly, the backbone of land reform work, in addition to the cadres sent down from above, are mainly "positive elements among the upright peasants." The meaning of "upright" or "pure" must be understood from the standpoint of the revolution. In the early days of liberation, capitalists in cities often had the mistaken idea that "workers do not have enough knowledge and are not qualified to lead," which caused their business to lose its way. Later, the proof of the facts will make them slowly understand, and their business operations will proceed smoothly. It is inevitable that the local gentry and landlords in the countryside will dislike the peasant cadres even more at the beginning, because the relationship between the two is hostile, which cannot be compared with the relationship between labor and capital in the city. It is very dangerous for us to casually accept the views of the local gentry and landlords, as it will confuse the boundary between friend and foe. It is possible that some bad elements may infiltrate the ranks of peasant activists in the initial stage, but once the peasant masses rise up, these bad elements will either be transformed or washed away. North China and Northeast China have had this experience. Over-relying on top-down rectification will lead to detachment from the masses and violate revolutionary principles. It is self-contradictory to say that the revolution is good on the one hand, and that the cadres are bad on the other hand. Because the revolution is done by the cadres. It is also inconsistent to admit that the revolution is progressing on the one hand, and that the cadres are degenerating on the other hand. Because without progressive cadres, there can be no progressive revolution. "The leader is good, the cadres are bad," this is what many people said to Chiang Kai-shek in the past. Today, everyone knows that this statement is wrong. The Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao fundamentally deny this statement.
    When a person's vested interests, property, and even prestige are violated, he will inevitably scold the violator as a rogue or a bandit. The Kuomintang reactionaries once scolded us, the saviors of the country, as rogues, but the real rogue, Chiang Kai-shek, was at that time their sacred and inviolable leader. The Communist Party was scolded as bandits for more than 20 years, and today, those who scolded others in the past have proved to be the real bandits. This is called not standing firm, which not only confuses friends and enemies but also reverses right and wrong.
    The leniency towards the landlord class must be limited. The Common Program stipulates that "but at the same time, give them a way out for life, and force them to transform themselves through labor and become new people." Exceeding this limit, allowing landlords to preserve their past prestige and superior living conditions, will violate the Common Program, confuse friends and enemies, and shake the major principle of "basing on the worker-peasant alliance." That is absolutely not allowed. The report puts forward the call to unite enlightened gentry, conditioned on supporting land reform; that land reform must, of course, still be the land reform stipulated by the Common Program. That is to say, they must have risen from the landlord class. If they still sympathize with the landlord class and advocate suppressing the peasants, it will be difficult to unite. In the revolutionary ranks, many of us also come from landlord families. The vast majority of them have gradually disappeared from their landlord class ideology due to subsequent work and life experience, and have become enemies of the landlord class. However, the remnants of old ideological consciousness often haunt the brain unconsciously and are difficult to completely overcome. Many people, including myself, are subjectively anti-feudal, but objectively, their lives and behaviors often expose feudal overtones. It is precisely for this reason that the Land Reform Law also prohibits corporal punishment and indiscriminate beatings and killings. These are all feudal, but under the retaliatory doctrine of "returning the person's way to treat his person," anti-feudal people will inevitably use feudal means to deal with the enemy. Therefore, we must constantly be vigilant and constantly carry out self-ideological struggle. Land reform is a big test, and I believe we will all pass it.
    "Acting in accordance with the Common Program" is an iron rule. Whether in discussions inside the venue or in speeches outside the venue, this point must be paid extreme attention. Reflecting deviations is good, necessary, and a great help to the government, but it must also be in the spirit of striving for the Common Program. It must be recognized that deviations must be corrected, but they are also unavoidable at the same time. Pointing out deviations must also point out their achievements and merits at the same time, so that people will be convinced and easily accept corrections. These are the attitudes that friends should have towards each other. Otherwise, the united front will experience unnecessary chaos, and discussions that deviate from principles will not be able to achieve results. Unity is principled. What is the principle? It is the Common Program that has been discussed thousands of times and has undergone rigorous testing. The bright future of the new country is entrusted to the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, firmly and unhesitatingly advancing towards the path of the Common Program.
    The above opinions are immature, please give your advice.

    政协全国委员会委员
    章乃器的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】全国委员会委员章乃器二十二日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席、诸位委员、诸位先生：
    我愿意就土改问题，发表一些浅薄的意见。
    这次刘副主席的报告和中共中央提出的土地改革法草案，是忠实地执行共同纲领的，同时又是完全适合目前的新形势的。共同纲领开宗明义很郑重地规定下来四友三敌的界限，这个界限，这次的法案是严格地加以划分的，是没有丝毫含糊的。但，由于我们已经建立起来全国性的、有高度效率的政权，我们的工作重心已经转入生产建设，这是新的形势。在这个新的形势之下，我们必须而且也可能更有秩序地进行土地改革，防止那些不应有的混乱状态的发生；必须而且也可能更有效地保证生产力的恢复和发展，而不使遭受不应有的损害。对于富农经济的保存和对于地主采取比较宽大的措施，是只能这样的来解释的，倘使认为这是对于地主阶级的妥协那就完全错误。这种右倾的想法应该加以澄清，以免动摇人民民主统一战线的基础。
    首先，所谓“更有秩序”的秩序必然是指革命的秩序，它不同于旧时代学者们所说的“法治”。它必须是农民群众在国家法令和政府领导之下自己起来进行土改，而不是单纯的依靠自上而下的行政措施。法令和政府的领导，必须注意自下而上地发动农民的力量，启发其自动性和自觉性，结合土改工作把农民更好的组织起来，使之成为新国家的重要基础，而决不应该去束缚农民的自觉和自动。（法令只能是领导农民、发动农民、组织农民的手段。）这是一个真理，是从过去革命的伟大胜利得到了证明的真理。是不应该再加怀疑的了。那些害怕农民起来的思想是绝对不能再有的了。
    其次，保存富农经济的作用，正如毛主席所指示我们的，是为着“以利于早日恢复农村生产，又利于孤立地主，保护中农和保护小土地出租者。”很明白的，土改工作的基本力量必须是依靠贫雇农团结中农，而富农只是恢复生产所必需的成份。因此，倘使认为我们可以把农民组织的重心转移到富农的身上去，可以轻视贫雇农，那显然是完全错误的。我们需要中立富农，但暂时也只能做到中立富农。法案规定不让富农加入农民协会是完全正确的，否则便很可能由富农取得了农民协会的领导，从而消灭了土改。在政治上还会使贫雇农模糊了阶级意识，甚至对新政权的信仰发生动摇，那就要妨害“以工农联盟为基础”的重大原则，为害更大。
    又其次，土改工作的骨干，除了上面派下去的干部之外，主要的还是“正派农民中的积极分子”。所谓“正派”或“纯洁”的涵义，是必须站在革命的立场去理解的。都市里的资方在解放初期，往往也有“工人知识不够，不配领导”的错误想法，因而使自己的事业进行迷失了方向。到后来，事实的证明会使他们慢慢的明白过来，他们的事业经营也就顺利向前了。农村中的土绅、地主们一开始要加倍的看不惯农民干部是必然的，因为这两者之间的关系是敌对的，是和都市的劳资双方关系不能比的。我们随便接受土绅、地主们的看法是有很大的危险的，是会混淆友敌的界限的。在初期，农民积极分子当中有若干不良分子的混入是可能的，但一旦农民大群的起来了，这些不良分子不是被改造，便会被洗刷。华北、东北都有此经验。过分依赖自上而下的整饬是会脱离群众，违反了革命原则的。一面说革命是好的，另一面说干部是坏的，那是自相矛盾的。因为，革命就是干部干出来的。一面承认革命在进步，而另一面说干部在退化也是说不圆的。因为，没有进步的干部就不可能有进步的革命。“领袖是好的，干部是坏的”，这是过去许多人对蒋介石说的，今天大家晓得此言错了。中共和毛主席根本否定这种说法。
    当着一个人的既得利益、财产以至威风受到了侵犯时，他必然要骂那侵犯者是流氓，是土匪。国民党反动派曾经骂我们救国家的分子是流氓，但是，真正的流氓蒋介石，那时候却正是他们的神圣不可侵犯的领袖。共产党被骂为土匪历二十余年，今天呢，那些过去骂人者却证明了是真正的土匪。这就叫做立场不站稳，不但要混淆友敌，而且还要颠倒是非的。
    对地主阶级的宽大必须是有限度的。共同纲领的规定是“但同时给以生活出路，并强迫他们在劳动中改造自己，成为新人。”超过了这个限度，允许地主们保存过去的威风和优越的生活条件，那就要违反了共同纲领，混淆了友敌，动摇了“以工农联盟为基础”的重大原则。那是万万不可以的。报告当中提出团结开明士绅的号召，而以赞成土改为条件；那个土改当然还必须是共同纲领所规定的土改。那就是说，他们必须是从地主阶级起义过来的。倘使他们依然同情地主阶级，主张抑压农民，那就难得团结。在革命队伍当中，我们许多人也是由地主家庭出身的。其中绝大多数由于以后的工作和生活锻炼，地主阶级的思想已经逐渐消失，变成了地主阶级的敌人。但，旧的思想意识残余在脑子里作祟，往往是不自觉的，是很难完全克服的。许多人，连我自己也在内，主观上是反封建的，但在客观上，生活和行为就时常会暴露出来封建的意味。正因为这一理由，所以土改法案还要禁止肉刑，禁止乱打乱杀。这些都是封建的，但在“以其人之道，还治其人之身”的报复主义之下，反封建的人们就难免要用封建的手段去对付敌人。因此，我们还必须不断的警惕，经常地进行自我思想斗争。土地改革是一场大考验，相信我们大家都会考得上的。
    “依照共同纲领办事”是一个铁则。不论在会场以内的讨论或者在会场以外的言论，这一点是必须极端注意的。反映偏差是好的，是必需的，是对于政府的很大的帮助，但也须抱定为共同纲领而奋斗的精神。要认定偏差是必须纠正的，但同时也是不可免的。指出偏差还要同时指出他们的成绩和功劳，才能使人心服，容易接受纠正。这都是朋友相处应有的态度。否则，统一战线便会发生不应有的混乱，而讨论离开了原则，也不可能得到结果。团结是有原则的。原则是什么？就是那经过千百次讨论，经过严格考验的共同纲领。新国家的光明前途就寄托在全国人民在中共和毛主席的领导之下，坚决地、毫不犹豫地，向共同纲领的道路前进。
    上面的意见是不成熟的，请大家指教。
