　　Hailstorms Strike Yu County and Other Areas;
    Preparations to Replant Late-Season Crops
    Due to the recent continuous hailstorms in Yu County, Shouyang, Pingding, Qi County, Xiyang, Yangquan and other counties under the jurisdiction of the Yuci Special District, and wind, frost, and insect disasters in other counties, the Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative has instructed county cooperatives at all levels to prepare a portion of late-season crops such as millet, mung beans, rapeseed, and buckwheat for the masses to replant. It is also cooperating with the government to mobilize the masses to manufacture gunpowder and make iron cannons to fight against hailstorms. (Zhang Buhua)
