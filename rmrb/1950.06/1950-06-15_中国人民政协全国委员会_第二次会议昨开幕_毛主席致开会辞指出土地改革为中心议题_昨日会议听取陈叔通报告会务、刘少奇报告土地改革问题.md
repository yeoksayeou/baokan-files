One hundred and forty-nine members of the National Committee and twenty-five members of the Central People's Government who are not also members of the National Committee attended the meeting. Those attending the meeting as observers included thirty-eight people specially invited through consultation by the Standing Committee of the National Committee, forty-six representatives sent by local political consultative conferences, and one hundred and sixty-four people including heads of various departments of the Central People's Government, staff members of the National Committee, heads of local people's governments, heads of military regions and directly subordinate corps of the People's Liberation Army, and ambassadors and envoys stationed abroad.

The meeting opened at 4 p.m. today. The meeting began with an opening address by Chairman Mao Zedong of the National Committee of the CPPCC. The meeting then heard a report on conference affairs by Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee, and a report on land reform issues by Liu Shaoqi, Standing Committee member of the National Committee and Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government.

The meeting will continue to hear reports tomorrow.

The full text of Chairman Mao's opening address is as follows:

"Comrade members, comrades, friends:

The National Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference is now in session for its second meeting. At this meeting, there will be reports on conference affairs, land reform work, economic and financial work, taxation work, foreign affairs and united front work, cultural and educational work, military work, and court work. It is hoped that these will be discussed. Among these, the issue of land reform is the central topic of this meeting. We hope that a land reform law will be passed at this meeting and implemented after approval by the Central People's Government. First, more than 100,000 cadres who are preparing to carry out land reform work should study this law as soon as possible, so that the reform of the land system can be carried out smoothly in areas with approximately 100 million agricultural population after this autumn. Naturally, all other reports are important. Opinions can be expressed on anything, and proposals can be submitted for deliberation. Whatever is feasible should be adopted. We have a great and correct Common Program as the criterion for reviewing work and discussing issues. The Common Program must be fully implemented; this is the fundamental law of our country at present. I believe that through the efforts of all comrades, our meeting will successfully complete its tasks. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the people of the whole country are now engaged in tremendous work, struggling to overcome difficulties and strive for the improvement of the economic situation. All the people's undertakings in our country are developing along new tracks, and progress and achievements can be seen every day. No difficulties can stop the advancement of the people's cause. The People's Political Consultative Conference and its elected National Committee are great united front political organizations that unite all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic figures from all walks of life in the country, and enjoy high prestige among the people of the whole country. We must consolidate this unity, consolidate our united front, and lead the people of the whole country steadily to achieve our goals."
