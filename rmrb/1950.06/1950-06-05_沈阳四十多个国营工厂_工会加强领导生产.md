Development of production is the highest interest and task of the working class
Union work in both public and private factories should be oriented towards production
The Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions stipulates that the purpose of the trade union is first and foremost to "unite workers across the country and protect the interests of workers." According to this principle, the trade union must unite and organize the working masses, educate the working masses to consciously abide by labor discipline, actively improve production, exchange production experience, and learn to manage production. Because the development of industrial production is the material basis for improving the lives of workers and all working people. Not only will the lives of workers improve if the production of state-owned factories develops, but also the restoration and development of all private capital-operated production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood is beneficial to the working class. At present, some trade union cadres only emphasize the immediate welfare of workers, some only engage in recreational activities and abstract political and ideological education, and some replace the administrative work of the factory with trade union work in certain aspects. These are all wrong ideas and practices, which will result in the opposition between the trade union and the administration, hinder production, and thus harm the highest and long-term interests of the working class. Some people know that the trade union should be oriented towards production, but they don't know how to do it. The following introduction to the experience of trade union work in Northeast China and other places is for learning by all regions. ——Editor

Shenyang Forty-Plus State-Owned Factories
	Trade Unions Strengthen Leadership in Production
[Shenyang News] Several factories in Shenyang have established production wage committees under the basic-level trade unions to further strengthen the trade unions' leadership over production work, solve various problems in production and wages, and ensure improved product quality and the completion of production tasks. According to statistics from the mechanical, electrical, chemical, and smelting systems, forty-two factories have established production wage committees and twenty-eight factories have established workshop production wage committees. The work of the production wage committees in twelve units, such as the Third Machine Factory, has been done well.

The tasks of the production wage committee are: to launch production competitions, exchange advanced experiences, lead teams in formulating production plans and workshop contact contracts, and solve some problems that occur in production and wages to ensure the completion and over fulfillment of production plans. In order to learn from the Ma Hengchang team, the production wage committee of the Automobile Parts Factory launched a production and conservation competition. By the end of April, thirty teams in the factory had reduced the reject rate. In April, a total of 231 teams in the units under the Mechanical Bureau formulated team plans. After the fifth group of the First Machine Factory's lathe workers formulated a team plan, they did not produce any defective products for a month and completed the task ten days ahead of schedule. The over fulfillment of the first quarter's production tasks of the Electrical Engineering Plant No. 1 was the result of formulating a contact contract under the leadership of the production wage committee. The factory's production tasks for January were not sent to the site until the middle of the month. At first, the workers had no confidence and estimated that the task could not be completed. The factory's production wage committee immediately called on "complete the task of the month in the same month" and led the relevant workshops to formulate contact contracts, closely cooperate, unite and help each other. As a result, the task was successfully completed. In order to improve the sintering block rate, the production wage committee of the Smelting Plant organized three experience exchange meetings. After worker Wang Kuanjiang introduced his experience in adding materials and using wind, the block rate increased to more than 60 percent.

### 沈阳四十多个国营工厂  工会加强领导生产

　　发展生产是工人阶级最高的利益和任务
    公私营工厂中的工会工作都要面向生产
    中华全国总工会章程规定工会的宗旨首先就是“团结全国职工，保护工人利益”。根据这个原则，工会就要团结、组织工人群众，教育工人群众自觉遵守劳动纪律，积极改进生产，交流生产经验，学习管理生产。因为，工业生产的发展乃是改善工人和一切劳动人民生活的物质基础。不但国营工厂生产发展了工人生活就能改善，一切私人资本所经营的有益于国计民生的生产事业的恢复和发展，也是对工人阶级有利的。目前工会工作干部中有的只强调工人眼前的福利，有的只搞文娱工作和抽象的政治思想教育，有的则在某些方面把工会工作去代替工厂的行政工作。这些都是错误的思想和作法，结果都会形成工会与行政的对立，妨碍生产，因之也就妨害了工人阶级的最高的长远的利益。还有的人知道工会应面向生产，可是不知道如何作法。下面介绍的东北等地工会工作的经验，可供各地学习。  ——编者
　　沈阳四十多个国营工厂
    工会加强领导生产
    【沈阳讯】沈阳若干工厂在基层工会下建立了生产工资委员会，以便进一步加强工会对生产工作的领导，解决生产和工资中的各种问题，保证提高产品质量，完成生产任务。据机械、电工、化学、冶炼四个系统统计，已有四十二个工厂建立了生产工资委员会，二十八个工厂建立了车间生产工资委员会。第三机器厂等十二个单位，生产工资委员会的工作作得较好。
    生产工资委员会的任务是：发动生产竞赛，交流先进经验，领导小组订立生产计划和车间联系合同，解决生产和工资中所发生的一些问题，以保证完成并超过生产计划。为了学习马恒昌小组，汽总机件厂的生产工资委员会发动了生产节约竞赛运动。至四月底，该厂已有三十个小组降低了废品率。四月份，机械局所属各单位，共有二百三十一个小组，订了小组计划。第一机器厂车工五组订立小组计划后，一个月没有产生废品，并提前十天完成任务。电工一厂第一季度生产任务超额完成，就是在生产工资委员会领导下，订立了联系合同的结果。该厂一月份的生产任务，到了月中才发到现场。职工最初都没有信心，估计任务不能完成。该厂生产工资委员会立即号召“当月任务，当月完成”，并领导各有关车间，订立联系合同，密切配合团结互助。结果胜利完成任务。为了提高烧结块率，冶炼厂的生产工资委员会组织了三次交流经验会议，经工友王宽江介绍添料、用风等经验后，块率即提高到百分之六十以上。
