　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Fuhua Fireworks Factory, located at 177 Chaowai Street, Beijing, experienced an explosion yesterday (the 14th) at approximately 5:00 PM. Casualties were heavy, and approximately a thousand homes in the vicinity were destroyed. According to preliminary statistics from last night: more than twenty residents died, one hundred and fifty-two were admitted to hospitals due to injuries, with more than ten in serious condition. Two hundred and eleven suffered minor injuries and were not hospitalized. Following the incident, approximately 2,000 personnel from various departments of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, including Public Security, Civil Affairs, Fire Department, Medical and Health, all students from the Municipal Party Committee Training Class, the Public Security Corps, and the Public Security School, rushed to the scene to carry out rescue and emergency measures. Municipal Government Secretary-General Xue Zizheng, Deputy Director of the Military Region Political Department Zhang Zhixiang, Zhang Nansheng, Deputy Chief of Staff Wang Changjiang, Director of the Municipal Government Suburban Committee Zhou Fengming, Deputy Directors of the Public Security Bureau Feng Jiping and Zhang Minghe, Director of the Public Health Bureau Yan Jingqing, Deputy Director Zhang Wenqi, Secretary-General of the CCP Municipal Committee Gu Dachuan, and others all rushed to the scene to assist the 13th District Government in carrying out various emergency rescue efforts. All seriously injured residents were rushed to the First Municipal Hospital, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking University Hospital, and Army Hospital for treatment. Those with minor injuries received on-site first aid and bandaging. All affected residents were temporarily resettled in nearby villages by the District Government last night, and emergency relief grain of one and a half jin of millet per person per day has been distributed. Coffins have been prepared for the deceased for burial. After the seriously injured were sent to the hospitals, CCP Municipal Committee Secretary Peng Zhen, Deputy Secretary Liu Ren, Mayor of the Municipal People's Government Nie Rongzhen, Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu, Director of the Public Security Bureau Luo Ruiqing, and Deputy Director Feng Jiping, among others, visited the injured in various hospitals to express their condolences and instructed the hospitals to take full responsibility for treatment. Last night, some public security, fire, and medical personnel remained on the scene, prepared to continue rescue work through the night.

　　After the incident, the responsible authorities of the Beijing Municipal People's Government immediately launched a self-criticism in addition to mobilizing rescue efforts. They believe that these dangerous industries should not have been located in densely populated urban areas. Although the fireworks factory was a legacy of the past, no order was issued to relocate it after liberation. The Municipal Government issued a public notice last year registering such dangerous industries and workshops and taking preventative measures, but these were not strictly enforced afterward, leading to this tragic accident and causing such significant loss of life and property to the people. The government authorities should deeply examine their due responsibilities. The Municipal People's Government has reported the incident to the State Council of the Central People's Government for disposition and has scheduled an emergency meeting for this morning to discuss the aftermath, thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident, and strictly hold those responsible accountable.

　　辅华火药厂发生爆炸
    附近居民损失严重正予紧急救治
    市政机关已作检讨并查究原因
    【京市新闻处讯】京市朝外大街一七七号辅华火药厂昨（十四）日下午五时许发生爆炸。伤亡惨重，附近房屋被震塌约千余间。据昨晚初步统计：死亡居民二十余人，因伤入医院者一百五十二人，内有十余人伤势较重。轻伤未住院者二百一十一人。事件发生后，京市人民政府公安、民政、消防、医药卫生、市委干训班全体学员、公安总队、公安学校等部门工作人员约二千人，即相继赶至现场进行抢救及各种紧急措施。市府秘书长薛子正、军区政治部副主任张致祥、张南生、副参谋长王长江、市府郊委会主任周凤鸣，公安局副局长冯基平、张明河，公共卫生局局长严镜清、副局长张文奇、中共市委会秘书长顾大川等人均赶至现场协助十三区区政府进行各项急救工作。所有重伤居民，均已急送市内市立第一医院、协和医院、北大医院、陆军医院医治，轻伤者当场救护、包扎，所有受灾居民均已于昨夜由区政府分别安置于附近村庄，并已发放急救粮每人每日一斤半小米暂行照顾。并为死者备棺装殓。重伤者送至医院后，中共市委会书记彭真、副书记刘仁、市人民政府市长聂荣臻、副市长张友渔、公安局局长罗瑞卿、副局长冯基平等曾分赴各医院慰问伤者。并嘱各医院切实负责治疗。昨夜，尚有部分公安、消防与医务人员留驻现场，准备继续通宵进行各项救助工作。
    事件发生后，京市人民政府负责当局除立即动员抢救之外，并即进行检讨。认为这些危险工业，根本不应在城区居民密集的区域开设，该火药厂虽是过去所遗留的，但解放以后没有限令迁移；市府在去年曾布告登记此种危险工业、作坊，采取防患步骤，而事后亦未严格执行，致有此次惨祸的发生，使人民生命财产受到这样重大的损失。政府当局自应深刻检讨应有的责任。市人民政府已将事件经过呈报中央人民政府政务院，听候处分；并定于今日上午召开紧急会议，讨论善后办法，彻查事件发生原因，严厉追究责任。
