Implementing the Policy of Opening Education to Workers and Peasants
    Over Half of This Year's New Students in Shenyang Middle Schools are Children of Workers and Peasants
    [This newspaper's Shenyang dispatch] This year, in Shenyang City's middle schools, the number of new students who are children of workers and peasants has exceeded half. Among them, the proportion of children of workers and poor peasants has almost doubled compared to the early days of liberation. Of the 8,145 new first-year students in municipal middle schools, 4,106 are children of workers, poor peasants, and middle peasants, accounting for 50.4 percent; they account for 53.5 percent of new junior high school students; and 78.5 percent of new junior normal school students (in addition, children of urban poor account for 7.4 percent of all new students, and the petty bourgeoisie accounts for 32 percent, which together with the children of workers and peasants account for 89.8 percent). The proportion of workers' children in all junior high school students has increased from 9.8 percent at the beginning of liberation to the current 17.4 percent, and the proportion of poor and lower-middle peasants' children has increased from 10.4 percent to 17.4 percent.
    The rapid growth in the proportion of worker and peasant children in secondary schools is due, on the one hand, to the fact that workers and peasants have stood up, their lives have improved, and they have the conditions to send their children to middle school. At the same time, the People's Government, in accordance with the policy of opening education to workers and peasants, has adopted the following two measures: First, the Municipal Education Bureau stipulates that children of workers, poor peasants, revolutionary soldiers, and cadres who have graduated from senior elementary school, who wish to enter middle school, and who pass the unified city-wide graduation examination with scores meeting the requirements for middle school admission, shall be admitted to middle school without examination. This method has admitted 1,526 children of workers and peasants. At the same time, in order to take care of the situation of worker and poor peasant children who apply to take the middle school entrance examination, who were deprived of the opportunity to receive due education in the old society, resulting in their low level of education, it is stipulated that their admission standards should be reduced by five points compared with general students. Through this measure, another 940 children of workers and peasants were admitted to school.
    Second, the majority of people's scholarships are used to help workers' and peasants' children solve their difficulties in seeking education. In the first semester of this year, 2,130 children of workers, poor peasants, and middle peasants enjoyed scholarships, accounting for 61.2 percent of the total number of scholarships. 533 children of the urban poor enjoyed scholarships, accounting for 15.3 percent of the total number.
    After adopting such methods, some people raised opinions, saying that the government was "biased" towards the children of workers and peasants, causing some children of the petty bourgeoisie to lose their schooling. The Education Bureau immediately explained to them and insisted on the policy of giving worker and peasant children priority in admission. In fact, up to now, the proportion of worker and peasant children in school is still very disproportionate to the proportion of workers and peasants in the population and their status in society, politics, and the economy. In the future, greater efforts should be made to absorb worker and peasant children into secondary schools. As for the fact that some students are currently out of school, it is mainly due to insufficient school buildings, funding, and teachers, and it is not yet possible to enable all students who wish to enter middle school to attend school. For this reason, Shenyang City is trying to run night middle schools and adopting the method of charging students part of the fees in order to increase the number of middle school students under the existing conditions.
    Due to the lack of necessary learning conditions in the past, most of the new students who are children of workers and peasants have a lower level of education. After entering school, some schools and teachers have paid attention to providing them with the necessary remedial opportunities and often provide individual guidance and specific help. However, most schools and teachers do not pay enough attention to this, which should be given serious attention in the future. (Wang Wu)

　　实施教育向工农开门的方针
    沈市各中学本年新生工农子女已超过半数
    【本报沈阳讯】沈阳市各中等学校本年度的新生中，工农子女已超过半数。其中工人及贫雇农子女的比例，较解放初期增加将近一倍。市立各中等学校一年级全体新生八、一四五人中，工人和贫雇及中农子女共计四、一○六人，占百分之五○·四；在初中新生中占百分之五三·五；在初级师范新生中占百分之七八·五（另外在全体新生中，城市贫民子女占百分之七·四，小资产阶级占百分之三二，与工农子女共计占百分之八九·八）。全部初中学生中工人子女的比例，由解放初的百分之九·八增为现在的百分之一七·四，贫雇农子女，由百分之一○·四增为百分之一七·四。
    中等学校工农子女比例的迅速增长，一方面是因为工农翻了身，生活改善，有了条件送子女进入中学；同时，人民政府根据教育向工农开门的方针，采取了下面两项措施：第一、市教育局规定：高小毕业生中之工人、贫雇农、烈军干属子女，其志愿升入中学，并经过全市毕业统一考试，成绩合乎中学入学条件者，准其免试进入中学。此一办法，共吸收了工农子女一、五二六名入学。同时，对报名投考中学的工人与贫雇农子女，为照顾其在旧社会中被剥夺了受应有的教育的机会，因而造成其文化程度低落的情况，规定其录取标准比一般学生降低五分。经过此一措施，又吸收了九四○名工农子女入学。
    第二、用大部人民助学金帮助工农子女解决求学困难。本年度上学期，有二、一三○名工人、贫雇中农子女享受助学金，占全部助学金名额百分之六一·二。城市贫民子女享受助学金者五三三名，占全部名额百分之一五·三。
    采取这样的办法，曾经有些人提出意见，说政府“偏向”工农子女，使中小资产阶级的一部分子女失学。教育局即时地向他们进行了解释，并坚持了给工农子女以优先入学机会的方针。事实上，到现在为止，工农子女入学的比例，与工农在人口中的比例及其在社会政治经济中的地位还很不相称，今后还应该以更大的努力，吸收工农子女进入中等学校。至于目前有一部分学生失学，主要地是由于校舍、经费和教员不足，还不可能达到使愿入中学的学生全部就学。为此，沈阳市正试办夜中学，并采取向学生收一部分费用的办法，以便在现有条件下增加中学生入学人数。
    新生中的工农子女，由于过去缺乏应有的学习条件，大部分文化水平较低。入学后，某些学校和教员，已注意予他们以必要的补习机会，经常给以个别指导与具体帮助。但大部分学校与教师对此还不够重视，应引起今后深切的注意。            （王无）
