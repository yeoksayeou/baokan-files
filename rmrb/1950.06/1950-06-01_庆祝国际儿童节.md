　　Celebrating International Children's Day
    Feng Wenbin
    June 1st of this year marks the first International Children's Day. On this day, children all over China and the world are reviewing their strength, celebrating this meaningful festival, and shouting out a common voice—to fight for the protection of children's rights and world peace.
    How should we celebrate this festival?
    First, expose to the children the crimes of imperialism in preparing for new wars and undermining world peace, and conduct among the children education on anti-imperialism, anti-aggression war, love of the motherland, and internationalism of loving the working people of the world. Be prepared, be prepared at all times: to contribute everything for the lasting peace of the world, for the construction of new China, and for the safety and happiness of children all over the world.
    Second, for the sake of the children's health, we must strengthen health education, promote and popularize children's sports activities, prohibit and improve all labor, work, learning, and activities that are harmful to children's health, and ensure that the next generation of new China is a healthy and happy generation.
    Third, intensify studies. For the construction of new China, it is necessary to strive to equip children with rich scientific knowledge and use various methods to do everything possible to continuously improve their cultural level.

　　庆祝国际儿童节
    冯文彬
    今年六月一日，是第一个国际儿童节。这一天，全中国和全世界的少年儿童们，都在检阅自己的力量，庆祝这个富有意义的节日，喊出一个共同的声音——为保卫儿童权利与世界和平而斗争。
    我们怎样来庆祝这个节日呢？
    第一，向少年儿童们揭露帝国主义准备新战争，破坏世界和平的罪恶，并在少年儿童中，进行反对帝国主义，反对侵略战争，热爱祖国，热爱全世界劳动人民的国际主义的教育。准备着，时刻准备着：为了世界的永久和平，为了新中国的建设，为了全世界儿童的安全和幸福而贡献出一切。
    第二，为着少年儿童们的健康，要加强卫生教育，要提倡和推广少年儿童的体育活动，要禁止和改善一切有碍少年儿童健康的劳动、工作、学习和活动，必须使新中国的后一代是健康幸福的一代。
    第三，加紧学习。为着新中国的建设，必须努力使少年儿童具有丰富的科学知识，应当用各种方法，尽一切可能，去不断地提高他们的文化水平。
