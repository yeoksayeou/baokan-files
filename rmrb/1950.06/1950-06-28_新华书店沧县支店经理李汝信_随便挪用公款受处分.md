　　Li Ruxin, Manager of Xinhua Bookstore Cangxian Branch,
    Punished for Misappropriating Public Funds

　　Li Ruxin, manager of Xinhua Bookstore Cangxian Branch, is a Communist Party member. Because the bookstore did not establish an accounting system, he casually borrowed public funds to make money by doing business himself. From last autumn to the present, he has misappropriated a total of 1.4 million yuan of public funds, and has sold a gold pen, a cabinet, and a bicycle. Last winter, when the commissioner's office auctioned materials, he used 100,000 yuan of public funds to buy clothes and cloth. In addition, in the past when prices fluctuated, he borrowed public funds without calculating the actual value, in order to obtain illegal profits, causing losses to the public.

　　After discovering Comrade Li Ruxin's mistake, the Cangxian District General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately conducted an investigation and asked him to reflect and conduct a self-criticism. At the same time, in order to educate Comrade Li Ruxin, it was decided to give him a public warning within the Party.

　　新华书店沧县支店经理李汝信
    随便挪用公款受处分
    新华书店沧县支店经理李汝信是共产党员。他因为书店没有建立会计制度，就随便借用公款，自己做买卖挣钱。自去秋至今，他共挪用公款一百四十万元，曾贩卖金笔一支、立柜一个、自行车一辆。去年冬季专署拍卖物资时，他又用公款十万元买了衣、布等物。此外，他在以前物价波动时，借用公款，不折实计算，以取得非法利润，使公家受到损失。
    中共沧县地委区总支委员会发觉李汝信同志的错误之后，即进行了检查，并要他作了反省与检讨。同时为了教育李汝信同志，决定在党内给予当众警告处分。
