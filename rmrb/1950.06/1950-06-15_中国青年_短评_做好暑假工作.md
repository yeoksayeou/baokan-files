Xinhua News Agency, June 12th – “China Youth” semi-monthly magazine, issue 41, published a short commentary entitled "Do a Good Job in Summer Vacation Work." The full text is as follows:

Summer vacation is approaching soon. Youth League organizations in various regions should, under the leadership of the People's Government education departments and in close cooperation with relevant groups, begin preparations to carry out summer activities for students.

In order to lay a more solid foundation for carrying out learning in the next semester, summer student work is very worthy of attention. Due to the different situations in the old and newly liberated areas, the content and form of summer activities should be different. In areas that have been liberated for a longer time, students have undergone preliminary ideological remolding, and the study of New Democracy has a considerable foundation. Students are diligent in their studies and their lives are quite tense. Some students are even affected in their physical health. During the summer vacation, attention should be paid to allowing students to get appropriate rest. Summer life should be pleasant and lively. Therefore, we should combine learning with cultural, recreational, and sports activities. We should learn in cultural, recreational, and sports activities, such as conducting visits and trips, camping, collecting specimens, making glider models, watching movies and dramas, listening to lectures on New Democratic policies, swimming, ball games, etc. From these pleasant activities, we can learn various practical knowledge, cultivate an interest in the study of various scientific knowledge, and improve physical health. In areas that have been liberated later, we should refer to the experience of summer schools and study groups held in Beijing and other places last year, focusing on organizing students to carry out preliminary ideological remolding, studying the basic issues of historical materialism or the history of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, so that students can establish a worldview of serving the people. At the same time, it is also necessary to carry out publicity and education on land reform policies in areas where land reform will be implemented after the autumn harvest this year. In some areas, due to economic difficulties, the problem of dropping out of school cannot be avoided in the next semester. Under possible conditions in these areas, summer labor construction teams can be organized to allow students to voluntarily contract for projects such as dike construction, road building, and municipal construction, to obtain certain remuneration. The problem of tuition fees can be partially solved as a result, and students' labor viewpoints can be exercised.

Youth League members should play an exemplary and leading role in the different tasks listed above in various regions. Youth League organizations in various regions can also jointly organize cadre training classes with student unions, organize cadres to study documents such as the "Outline of the Work of the Youth League School (University and Middle School) Branch," so as to better summarize the work of the last semester and formulate the work plan for the next semester.

### “中国青年”短评  做好暑假工作

　　“中国青年”短评
    做好暑假工作
    【新华社十二日讯】“中国青年”半月刊第四十一期发表题为《做好暑假工作》的短评，全文如下：
    暑假快要到来，各地青年团的组织应该在人民政府教育机关领导下及有关团体密切配合下着手准备开展学生的暑期活动。
    为了给下学期开展学习打下更巩固的基础，暑期学生工作是很值得重视的。由于新老区情况的不同，暑期活动的内容和方式便应该有区别。在解放较久的地区，学生们已经过初步的思想改造，新民主主义学习已有相当基础，学生对于学业孜孜不倦，生活是相当紧张的，甚至有一些学生因而影响到身体健康，在暑假就应该注意让同学们得到适当的休息。暑期生活要过得愉快活泼。因此，我们应该将学习和文化娱乐体育活动结合起来，要在文化娱乐体育活动中学习，如进行参观旅行，露营，采集标本，制滑翔机模型，看电影话剧，听新民主主义政策的讲座，游泳，球赛等。从这些愉快的生活中，能够学习到各种实际知识，并培养出对各种科学知识研究的兴趣，增进身体的健康。在解放较晚的地区，我们就要参照去年北京等地举办暑期学园、学习团的经验，以组织学生进行初步思想改造为主，学习历史唯物论的基本问题或中国新民主主义革命史，使学生们建立为人民服务的人生观。同时，今年秋收后即将实行土地改革的地区，进行土地改革政策的宣传教育也是必要的。有些地区，因为经济困难，失学问题在下学期还不能避免发生。这些地区在可能的条件下，可以组织暑假劳动建设队，让学生自愿承包修堤筑路市政建设等工程，取得一定报酬。学费问题既可因而得到部分解决，并且可以锻炼学生的劳动观点。
    青年团员在上列各个地区的不同任务中，应该起模范带头作用。各地青年团的组织还可以和学联共同举办干部训练班，组织干部学习《青年团学校（大中学）支部工作纲要》等文件，以便更好地总结上学期的工作，拟定下学期的工作计划。
