Tianjin Private Hengyuan Textile Factory
A Model of "Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit for Production Development"
Labor and Capital Break Down Concerns, Focusing Wholeheartedly on Production

In the past year, although the production of yarn and cloth at the Hengyuan Textile Factory in Tianjin increased month by month, by December, the average unit output of yarn was only 0.763 pounds, and the unit output of cloth was 62.62 yards. Compared with the highest output before liberation, yarn was still 4.8 percent lower, and cloth was 3.1 percent lower. At the same time, there was significant waste in production, and the production order was poor. As a result, the wealth that should have been produced was not, and costs increased according to reasonable calculations. Why did this happen? The main reason was that the new labor-capital relationship had not been established after liberation, and the problems existing in production management had not been specifically resolved based on the policy of developing production for the mutual benefit of labor and capital. Therefore, both labor and capital had ideological obstacles in developing production. The trade union regarded handling employee welfare as more important than production. The capitalists believed that the factory was difficult to manage. It was not until the beginning of this year that the relationship between labor and capital began to change. This was primarily because the Party and trade union leadership recognized the work policy of engaging in production in private factories. This was gradually clarified after listening to the reports of Huang Huoqing, director of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Mayor Huang Jing at the first Tianjin Municipal Workers' Congress and the second Tianjin Municipal People's Congress. In addition, the factory was facing a crisis at the time due to a lack of raw cotton, and workers were concerned about unemployment. Therefore, after the raw cotton problem was resolved, the trade union vigorously called for focusing on production. At the labor-capital consultation meeting, worker representatives put forward several very important suggestions for improving production organization and production methods, which changed the capitalist's perception of workers and the trade union. In addition, the capitalists saw that prices were beginning to stabilize, the weaving industry was improving, and yarn was completely selling, so they realized that the only way to make more money was to find ways to reduce costs. Therefore, they began to pay attention to increasing production, improving quality, reducing waste, and the shortcomings in factory management. Therefore, when the trade union proposed launching a red flag competition, they expressed great support and took the initiative to solicit opinions from the trade union. The methods, conditions, and standards of the competition were jointly formulated by the capitalists and the trade union and submitted to the workers for discussion and implementation.

The way the factory trade union mobilized workers to engage in production was to first educate workers by grasping specific facts. For example, after signing a cotton yarn exchange contract with the state-owned China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation (中纺), the union focused on the cloth factory and held workshop meetings. The workshop committee explained the difficulties facing the factory and the government's assistance. At the same time, using the production figures and expenses of China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation (中纺), it was explained that if Hengyuan wanted to overcome difficulties and develop production in the future, it must reduce waste and improve quality. After the meeting, an outline was distributed for everyone to discuss. During the discussion, the workers said: The factory is our rice bowl, and we must work hard to produce in the future. On the same day, after work, all the yarn tubes that had been thrown on the ground were picked up, and production improved significantly within a day. At the same time, close attention was paid to educating workers with the model deeds of workers. After the trade union conducted several enlightening educations for the workers, the workers automatically examined their shortcomings and guaranteed that they would not waste or be passive in production, thereby greatly increasing production and conservation. Originally, the pre-spinning workshop of the yarn factory had to produce 700 pounds of returned cotton waste every day. After the self-criticism, it only produced 200 to 300 pounds, and the fine cotton leather roller waste was also reduced from 500 to 600 pounds to 200 to 300 pounds. At that time, the trade union held a celebration meeting based on these facts, announcing the conservation figures at the meeting, which made the workers even more enthusiastic.

Party and Communist Youth League members also made great achievements in leading the masses to engage in production. The factory's Communist Party members had a very high prestige among the masses due to their exemplary role in their work. The Party members in the cloth factory often met to study the work of the workshop. When they came up with good methods, they publicized and promoted them to the masses. Before the factory's red flag competition, some backward workers were very passive in their work. Therefore, they launched a mutual aid movement in the group through Communist Youth League members. Whoever was not active or good at work, they would take the initiative to help. The mutual aid movement was thus launched enthusiastically, laying the foundation for the red flag competition.

The staff also improved their enthusiasm by being educated through production meetings. After liberation, due to the estrangement between employees, the staff did not dare to manage the workers and were irresponsible in their work. At the production meetings, the staff saw the workers' enthusiasm for production and also saw that the workers welcomed them to be responsible for production. As a result, they had confidence in management and recognized their past mistakes. Some people also made self-criticisms at the production meetings. Through the production meetings, the staff not only discussed work together frequently, but also studied technology together. As a result, each workshop of the factory has recently made many improvements in technology and machine parts.

Improve Labor-Capital Relations and Launch a Red Flag Competition

Due to the improvement of labor-capital relations and the enthusiasm of the employees in production, the factory trade union launched a red flag competition in early April this year. In the red flag competition, the problems in production organization, management, and machine operation that had not been solved in the factory for many years were first solved. In the past, the various workshops of the factory were uncoordinated and unbalanced in production organization. For example, the roving could not supply the spinning, and the cone, warp, sizing, and drawing-in departments of the cloth factory often had to wait for work. In the red flag competition, not only the factory paid attention to solving this more serious problem affecting production, but the workers were also very concerned and put forward many specific improvement suggestions, so that unreasonable production organizations were improved. In terms of management, no one was responsible for even the most important statistical work in the past, so the statistics were often not accurate. Other calculations, such as the number of yards of cloth and the number of pounds of yarn, were also unscientific. In the competition, the factory felt that it could not improve. Therefore, it sent employees to China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation (中纺) to visit and learn China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation (中纺)'s reasonable practices. In addition, due to the different energy and styles of the factory's machines, the rotation speed was also different, which affected the development of production. In the red flag competition, employees took the initiative to study together and put forward reasonable suggestions, so that the operation of the spinning machines was largely consistent, and the output of spinning increased greatly.

In the red flag competition, the factory's production was rapidly improved. For example, the unit output of yarn in the first half of April was 0.8031 pounds, and in the first half of May it reached 0.852 pounds, an increase of about 6.8 percent. In terms of conservation, the recycled cotton waste in the cloth factory averaged 86.5 pounds per day in the first half of April, and in the first half of May it was reduced to 49.6 pounds per day, a decrease of about 42 percent.

Because of the rapid development of production, the factory's capitalists recently paid out dividends for 1949 and planned to build a new factory in Xi'an to expand production. In terms of employee welfare, the capitalists are also more concerned due to the increasing production profits. In addition to the relatively complete labor insurance regulations that have been implemented, the factory's hospital and employee children's primary school are now also being expanded and improved. In order to take care of the workers' health, the factory also plans to raise the workers' meals to the same level as the staff. In addition, the factory has established a health committee composed of cadres from both labor and capital to specifically study and improve the employee health facilities in the factory.

　　天津私营恒源纺织厂
    “劳资两利发展生产”的范例
    劳资打破顾虑  齐心面向生产
    在去年一年中，恒源纺织厂纱布的生产虽在逐月提高，但直到十二月，纱的平均单位零点七六三磅，布的单位产量六二点六二码，与解放前的最高产量比较，纱还低百分之四点八，布还低百分之三点一。同时在生产中的浪费很大，生产秩序不好，因此，应当生产出来的财富还没有生产出来，按合理的计算成本增高了。为什么会有这种现象呢？主要原因，是解放后新的劳资关系未能建立，以及未能根据发展生产劳资两利的政策具体解决生产管理上存在的问题，因此劳资双方在发展生产上都存在着思想障碍。工会把搞职工福利比搞生产看得更为重要。资本家则认为工厂很难管理。直到今年初，劳资双方的关系才开始转变。这首先是由于党和工会的领导方面认识了在私营工厂也要搞生产的工作方针。这是在津市第一届工人代表会和第二届各界人民代表会议上，听了津市总工会黄火青主任和黄敬市长的报告后，并经过津市总工会多次具体的指示，才逐渐明确的。加以该厂当时由于原棉缺乏，生产面临危机，工人已有失业的顾虑，于是在原棉问题解决以后，工会就大力号召面向生产。在劳资协商会议上工人代表提出了极为重要的改进生产组织和生产方法的多项意见。转变了资方对工人和工会的认识。加之当时资方看见物价开始走向稳定，织布工业的好转，纱完全走向实销等情况；同时由于与国营花纱布公司签订了纱布交换合同，因此认识到要想多赚钱只有从降低成本上想办法，所以对增加生产，提高质量，减少浪费以及工厂管理上的缺点，开始重视起来。因此当工会提出搞红旗竞赛时，就表示非常赞成，并主动找工会征求意见。竞赛的办法、条件、标准就是资方和工会共同拟定交由工人讨论实行的。
    该厂工会发动职工搞生产的方式，首先是抓住具体事实向职工进行教育。比如在与国营花纱布公司签订了棉纱的交换合同以后，就以布厂为重点，召开了车间会议，由车间委员说明了工厂面临的困难，和政府的扶助。同时用中纺的生产数字和开支，说明恒源今后要想度过困难，发展生产，必须减少浪费，提高质量。会后又发下提纲让大家讨论，讨论时工人们都说：工厂就是饭碗，今后一定要努力生产。当天上班后，扔在地上的纱管就都拣干净了，在一天内生产就有显著的提高。同时也密切地注意了用工人的模范事迹教育工人。工会在对工人进行了几次启发教育以后，工人就自动检讨了自己的缺点，并保证生产中不浪费、不消极，因此使得生产和节约大为提高。原来纱厂前纺每天回花要出到七百磅，检讨后只出二、三百磅，细花皮辊花也由五、六百磅，减少到了二、三百磅。当时工会就以这些事实开了一次庆功大会，在会上宣布了节约数字，使得工人情绪更高。
    党、团员带动群众搞生产，也有着极大的成绩。该厂共产党员由于工作中的模范作用，在群众中都有着很高的威信。布厂党员经常在一起碰头研究车间工作，他们想出了好的办法时，就向群众宣传推广。该厂红旗竞赛以前，有些落后工人在工作中很消极，于是就通过团员在小组里发动互助运动，谁工作不积极、不好，他们就主动去帮助。互助运动因此热烈展开，打下了红旗竞赛的基础。
    职员通过生产会议得到教育，也提高了积极性。解放后由于职工间存在着隔阂，职员不敢管理工人，在工作中不负责任。在生产会议上，职员一方面看到了工人在生产上的积极性，同时也看到了工人欢迎他们在生产上负责，因而使他们在管理上有了信心，同时并认识了自己过去的错误，有些人并在生产会议上做了检讨。通过了生产会议，职工不但经常在一起商量工作，而且能够共同钻研技术，因而该厂各车间最近在技术和机件上都有不少改进。
    改善劳资关系  发动红旗竞赛
    由于劳资关系的改善和职工们在生产中发挥了积极性，该厂工会就在今年四月初发动了红旗竞赛。在红旗竞赛中，首先解决了该厂多年以来没有解决过的生产组织、管理和机器运转上的问题。过去，该厂在生产组织上各个车间都不协调、不平衡，如粗纱供不上细纱，布厂准备科的筒子、经纱、浆纱、掏综等各部经常有等待工作的现象。在红旗竞赛中，不但厂方注意解决这种影响生产较为严重的问题，工人们也都非常关心，曾经提出了许多具体的改进意见，而使不合理的生产组织都得到了改进。在管理方面，过去连最重要的统计工作都没有人负责，因此统计多不够真实。其它如计算布的码数、纱的磅数也都不科学。在竞赛中，厂方感到不改进不行了，于是就派职工到中纺参观，学习了中纺的合理的做法。另外在机器的运转上，由于该厂机器的能率、式样都不同，所以转数也不同，影响着生产的发展。在红旗竞赛中职工主动在一起研究，并提出合理的建议，使得细纱机的运转大体上一致了，因而细纱产量大增。
    在红旗竞赛中，该厂生产得到了迅速的提高。比如四月上半月纱的单位产量是零点八零三一磅，到五月上半月则达到了零点八五二磅，较前约提高了百分之六点八；在节约方面布厂的回丝，四月上半月每日平均出八十六点五磅，到五月上半月每日则减到了四十九点六磅，较前约减少了百分之四十二。
    因为生产的迅速发展，该厂资方最近提发了一九四九年的股息，并计划在西安建一新厂以扩大生产。在职工福利方面，由于生产盈利日增，资方也更加关心，现在除已经实行了比较完善的劳保条例，该厂医院和职工子弟小学现也正在扩充和改进；厂方为了照顾工人的身体健康，并计划把工人的伙食提高到和职员一样。此外该厂并由劳资双方派遣干部成立了卫生委员会，专门研究改进工厂内的职工卫生设施。
