　　Solving the Problem of Water Accumulation in Laboring People's Residential Areas
    New Sewers Built at Paozi River and Other Locations
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] To solve the problem of water accumulation during the rainy season in laboring people's residential areas lacking sewers, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Sanitation and Engineering began constructing new sewers and leveling road surfaces last month in areas such as Paozi River in the Eastern District, Xin Pi Ku Hutong in Xidan, and the eastern entrance of Taipingcang. Currently, the road leveling project at the eastern entrance of Taipingcang has been completed. The construction of new pipe trenches in Xin Pi Ku Hutong and Paozi River is still underway and is expected to be completed before the 28th of this month. Construction will also begin soon in other waterlogged areas in the east, west, and north city corners, Xiangbizi Houkeng, and Xiaowutiao and Xiaoliutiao in Xuanwai Jiaochang.
    These areas have been seriously waterlogged for years. During the rainy season, the water accumulation is generally more than three centimeters; sometimes the water depth in Xin Pi Ku Hutong reaches six centimeters, and in Paozi River, it reaches one meter. Homes of nearby residents are often damaged and collapsed due to being eroded by the accumulated water, and the breeding of mosquitoes makes it very easy to spread diseases. The situation can be fundamentally changed after this year's construction. However, local residents should be careful not to dump garbage and sewage into the ditches, and they should take good care of the projects completed this year to avoid water accumulation again next year.

　　解决劳动人民聚居区域积水问题
    泡子河等处新建下水道
    【京市新闻处讯】为了解决市内没有下水道而劳动人民聚居区域的雨季积水问题，京市人民政府卫生工程局已自上月起，开始东城泡子河、西单新皮库胡同、太平仓东口等处的新建下水道及平顺路面工程。目前太平仓东口平顺路面工程已经完成，新皮库胡同及泡子河新建管沟工程仍在进行，预计本月二十八日前亦可竣工。其他东、西、北城根，象鼻子后坑，宣外校场小五条、小六条等积水区，也将于近日施工。
    这些地方历年来就是积水严重的区域，每当雨季，一般积水都在三公寸以上；有时新皮库胡同积水深六公寸，泡子河积水深达一公尺。附近居民住房常因受积水浸蚀倒塌损坏，且由于蚊虫滋生，极易传染疾病。今年施工后基本上可改变这种情况，但当地居民应注意勿再向沟道倾倒垃圾秽水，对今年已完竣的工程多加爱护，以免明年又要积水。
