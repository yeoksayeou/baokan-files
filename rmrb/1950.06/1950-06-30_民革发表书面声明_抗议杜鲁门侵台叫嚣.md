The KMT Revolutionary Committee Issues Written Statement
    Protesting Truman's Belligerent Invasion of Taiwan

    [This Newspaper] The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a written statement on the 29th protesting U.S. President Truman's order for the U.S. Seventh Fleet to prevent our liberation of Taiwan, an act of aggression. The statement is as follows:

    The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang believes that U.S. President Truman's unreasonable act of directly interfering in China's internal affairs with military force is not only an attempt to obstruct the Chinese people's cause of liberation, but also a provocation to launch a war of aggression against the entire Asian people. The Chinese people have long been deeply aware that the United States is planning a set of aggressive plans against China and Asia, so they only regard Truman's statement on January 5 this year of non-interference in Taiwan as the deceptive talk of imperialists. The Chinese people were not deceived by his hypocritical statement in the past, and they will never be frightened by his threatening statement today.

    The United States has not only instructed MacArthur to release Japanese war criminals, but also authorized MacArthur to use armed force to interfere in South Korea and Taiwan. MacArthur has actually replaced the past acts of aggression of Japanese war criminals against Korea and China. And the ultimate fate suffered by the Japanese imperialists will inevitably be the inescapable fate of the U.S. imperialists.

    We firmly support the statement of Mr. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government: "No matter what obstructive actions the U.S. imperialists take, the fact that Taiwan belongs to China can never be changed; this is not only a historical fact, but has also been affirmed by the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, and the status quo after the Japanese surrender. All the people of our country will be united as one and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan from the hands of the American aggressors. The Chinese people, who defeated Japanese imperialism and the American imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek, will surely victoriously expel the American aggressors and recover Taiwan and all territories belonging to China."

    The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang will follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, unite with the oppressed peoples of the East, and carry out an unshakable liberation struggle. The peace-loving and democratic people of the whole world will surely stand with the Chinese people, and towards a common goal, completely destroy the heinous American imperialists from the world of mankind.

### 民革发表书面声明  抗议杜鲁门侵台叫嚣

　　民革发表书面声明
    抗议杜鲁门侵台叫嚣
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会于二十九日发表书面声明，抗议美国总统杜鲁门命令美国第七舰队阻止我解放台湾的侵略行为。声明如下：
    中国国民党革命委员会认为美国总统杜鲁门这种直接以武力干涉中国内政的无理行为，不但是企图对中国人民解放事业妄加阻挠，而且是对整个亚洲人民发动侵略战争的挑衅。中国人民很久以来就深知美国对中国以及亚洲正在布置一套侵略计划，所以对于杜鲁门本年一月五日所发表的不干涉台湾的声明，只是看作帝国主义者的欺人之谈。中国人民从前既不为他伪善的声明所欺，今日亦绝不为他威胁的声明所惧。
    美国既指使麦克阿瑟释放日本战犯，复授权麦克阿瑟武装干涉南韩和台湾。麦克阿瑟实际上已经代替了日本战犯过去对于朝鲜和中国的侵略行为。而日本帝国主义者所遭受的最终命运，也必然是美帝国主义者无可逃避的命运。
    我们坚决拥护我中央人民政府外交部长周恩来先生的声明：“不管美国帝国主义者采取任何阻挠行动，台湾属于中国的事实，永远不能改变；这不仅是历史的事实，且已为开罗宣言、波茨坦宣言及日本投降后的现状所肯定。我国全体人民，必将万众一心，为从美国侵略者手中解放台湾而奋斗到底。战胜了日本帝国主义和美帝国主义走狗蒋介石的中国人民，必能胜利地驱逐美国侵略者，收复台湾和一切属于中国的领土。”
    中国国民党革命委员会将遵循孙中山先生的遗教，联合东方各被压迫民族，来进行不可动摇的解放斗争。全世界爱好和平民主的人民，必然和中国人民站在一起，向着共同的目标，把罪恶昭彰的美帝国主义者从人类的世界中彻底毁灭。
