　　Visiting the Leningrad Shoe Factory
    ——Diary of a Visit to the Soviet Union, Part Three
    Zhao Guoyou
    On May 10th, our Chinese delegation visited the Leningrad Shoe Factory. The factory director introduced us to the factory's situation:

    Before the war, this factory had over eleven thousand workers in production. During the Great Patriotic War, the factory suffered the most brutal destruction from the German fascist army. At that time, the factory was only fifteen kilometers from the front line, and bombs and shells rained down on the workshops. Not a single workshop in the entire factory was intact. Only two hundred workers remained in the factory to persevere in their work, and their lives were extremely difficult, with each person able to eat only half a catty of bread almost every day, and sometimes even going hungry. But even in such difficult days, the workers still persisted in their work. They not only engaged in mutual aid, but also in socialist production competitions. The factory director pointed to the two flags hanging on the wall and said, "These are the flags we won at that time, and they are still preserved."

    Speaking of this, the factory director took out a photo album for us to see. These photos were all of the factory's destruction during the war. We gathered around and turned the pages one by one. Some comrades counted the number of bombs, and others kept saying, "That's really tough!" Looking at these photos made us more clearly see how the Soviet workers fought against the fascist bandits.

    After introducing the factory's previous situation, the factory director asked us, "Do you have any other questions?" We unanimously asked the factory director to introduce the current situation of the factory. The factory director happily said, "Let's go and visit it now. You will know the current situation after you have seen it!"

    We first visited the Rationalization Proposal Research Office. Here, a technician pointed to various materials and finished products and introduced us, saying, "After the workers put forward rationalization proposals, they work with the technical staff here to study them. After success, small booklets are printed and promoted nationwide. For example, a female worker in this factory who was in charge of cutting materials, she researched a method that can save materials for eleven thousand pairs of shoes every month. The state awards her fifty percent of the value of the materials she saved as a bonus. Now the entire factory is universally implementing her method." The technician carefully explained the achievement chart of rationalization proposals to us, and we became more and more envious as we listened.

    We walked to the mechanized production workshop. As soon as we entered, we saw shoes on machines and conveyor belts; from this end to that end, from below to above. Staff members were working intensively beside various machines. The technician introduced us: From this end to that end, the finished product comes out. The factory produces five hundred pairs of shoes per day, with an average of twelve pairs of shoes produced per person.

    Walking further inside, there were two large floodlights, and the comrades filming were holding movie cameras and filming us. Wherever we went, the lights followed us. Especially when we walked to the raw material saving area and talked with the model female comrade with a big red flag hanging next to the machine, the comrades filming were sweating profusely, running to a very high shelf to film us. When we walked to the newly built workshop after the factory's restoration, the large floodlights were already waiting there, just like acting in a play.

    Finally, the factory director led us to visit the radio station, broadcasting room, sanatorium, recuperation institute, and cafeteria. What we envied most was the command post for the mechanized management of the factory. When we entered this room, everyone thought it was a large typewriter or a radio station. After translation, we learned that it was the command post for managing the factory. It can directly contact various parts of the site, so that everything on the site can be resolved immediately. The commander comrade gave us a demonstration. When she pressed a number, a workshop would talk to her. She did several tests for us to see. She said: This can save a lot of running around time, and everything can be resolved in a timely manner.

### 参观列宁格勒皮鞋工厂——访苏日记之三

　　参观列宁格勒皮鞋工厂
    ——访苏日记之三
    赵国有
    五月十日，我们中国代表团去参观列宁格勒皮鞋工厂。厂长给我们介绍这个工厂的情形：
    在战前，这个工厂有一万一千多个工人生产。在大战中，工厂遭受了德国法西斯军队最残酷的破坏。当时，工厂离前线只有十五公里，炸弹和炮弹纷纷落到车间，全厂车间没有一个完整的。那时候，全厂只留下了二百名工人在坚持工作，他们的生活困难万分，差不多每天每人只可以吃到半斤面包，有时甚至饿肚子。但就在这样艰苦的日子里，工人们也仍然坚持着工作。他们不但搞互助，还搞社会主义生产竞赛。厂长指着墙上挂的两面旗子说：“这就是那时候得的旗，现在还保存着。”
    说到这里，厂长拿出一本照片给我们看。这些照片全是在战争中工厂被破坏的情况。我们围在一块，一页一页翻着。有的同志数着炸弹数目，有的同志不住地说着：“真够呛！”看了这些照片，使我们更清楚地看到了苏联工人弟兄，是怎样对法西斯匪帮们进行斗争的。
    把工厂的以前情况介绍完以后，厂长又问我们：“你们还有什么问题吗？”我们一致提出：请厂长介绍一下现在工厂的情况。厂长很高兴地说：“我们现在就去参观一下吧。你们看过以后就知道现在的情况啦！”
    我们首先去参观合理化建议研究室。在这里，技师指着各种各样的材料和成品给我们介绍说：“工人提出合理化建议后，就和技术人员在这里研究。成功后，即印出小册子，推广全国。比如本厂有位下材料的女工，她研究出一个方法，每月能省一万一千双鞋的料子。国家按她省下料子的价值，提出百分之五十的奖金奖励她。现在全厂都普遍按照着她的办法施行。”技师仔细地给我们解释合理化建议的成绩表，我们越听越羡慕。
    走到机械化生产车间。一进屋，我们就看到鞋子在机器上、轮带上；从这头到那头，从下面到上面。工作人员在各种不同的机器旁边，紧张地工作着。技师给我们介绍说：从这头到那头，成品就出来了。全厂日产五百双鞋，平均每人生产十二双鞋。
    又往里走，有二面大照明灯，拍电影的同志拿着电影机对着我们嘟嘟的照。我们走到那里，灯火就跟着我们走。尤其当我们走到节省原料处，机器旁挂着大红旗子的模范女同志跟前谈话时，拍电影的同志，急的满头流汗，跑到很高的架子上对我们照。我们走到工厂恢复后新建筑的车间时，大照明灯也早就在那里等着我们，就像演戏一样。
    最后，厂长又引着我们参观了无线电站、广播室、疗养所、修养院、食堂。使我们最羡慕的是机械化管理工厂的司令台。当我们走进这个屋子的时候，大家都以为是大型打字机或是电台，经翻译后才知道是管理工厂的司令台。它直接能和现场各处取得联系，使现场一切情况能立时得到解决。司令员同志给我们试验一下，她一按号码，就有一个车间和她说话。她连着试验好几次给我们看。她说：这可以省很多跑腿时间，一切事情能及时得到解决。
