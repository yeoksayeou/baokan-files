　　How Did the Seventy Factory's Drama Troupe Develop?
　　Guo Maolin, Zhang Shirong
　　After the liberation of Beijing, the workers were transformed from the oppressed into the masters of the factory. The staff and workers felt an urgent need for cultural entertainment. In the early days of liberation, with the assistance of the work team, the Seventy Factory established a yangko team and a reading room. The workers began to engage in proper cultural entertainment activities. After watching the performances of the "Literacy for Husband and Wife" and other plays by the cultural troupe, the workers further proposed the establishment of a drama troupe. Originally, there were many things in the factory that could be brought to the stage. Initially, the leadership considered, "What if not many people participate in the establishment of a drama troupe?" The workers said optimistically, "There are people, plenty of them!" The leadership also considered, "Who will provide guidance?" After contacting the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, several comrades from the cultural troupe were introduced to our factory. In this way, the problem was solved, and our factory established its own drama troupe in April last year. The guiding comrades helped us very enthusiastically. They lived and worked with the troupe members; and collected materials together with the troupe members. The guiding comrades gave the troupe a lot of help in writing skills. The play "The Liberated Arsenal" was the initial collective creation of our factory's drama troupe.
　　Our factory does not have an auditorium. To commemorate "May Day," a stage was set up at the Imperial College. The "Liberated Arsenal" and "Who Holds the Key," published by the Tianjin Literature and Art Department, were performed for the first time. In general, people have a good evaluation of this performance. But some people criticized the stage curtains, lighting, and props: "How much does this cost! Too wasteful!" Before this, some comrades in the troupe were also arrogant and conceited, divorced from the masses. Within the troupe, some people only proceeded from their own interests in terms of performance, and even did not like to perform their own plays, wanting to perform "big scenes." They ignored that they were an amateur troupe.
　　The Culture and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions discovered the shortcomings of our factory's drama troupe and the criticisms of the masses towards the troupe. They gave instructions at the members' meeting and put forward the slogan "Drama must be combined with production, and drama troupe staff must be upright and earnest." In this way, we began to reorganize the organization. A small number of extremely mischievous people who were unwilling to study seriously withdrew, and twenty-five or six actors who were really enthusiastic about their work expressed their determination to run the troupe well. Combining with the chaotic phenomenon of the factory's transition, we self-compiled and self-directed the one-act play "Stand Firm on the Class Standpoint," which stabilized the uneasy emotions of some people. In the relatively smooth work, the troupe increased its confidence and felt the importance of performing its own plays; then, we introduced some scripts, books, and newspapers to everyone, creating a creative upsurge. During the Beijing Municipal Workers' Joint Performance, everyone worked together, collected the story of the bad steam hammer in the factory's production competition, and collectively wrote the script "One Inch Longer in Production," which was rated as the "banner of workers' literature and art" in the joint performance.
　　Our drama troupe lacks female actors, which has added great difficulties to the performance. Finally, we came up with a way - to mobilize the family members of the staff. We tried to go to the family dormitory to discuss this matter. Unexpectedly, the mother of Du Jize, a worker in our factory, who was already fifty years old, agreed very generously, and then she mobilized the wives of Wang Junzhen, Shi Weixian, and others. In this way, our drama troupe smoothly performed "That Day of the Week," "Recognize Friends," "Cure," and "Expenditure," etc., with female roles participating. In addition, our drama troupe also mastered the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. In this way, we transformed one or two comrades with eccentric tempers and strong individual heroism. This was also a gain in performance.
　　The deputy director and the head of the Culture and Education Department of our factory are very concerned about the growth of the drama troupe. Recently, they pointed out the direction of the drama troupe's activities, giving us great encouragement. The administration and the trade union also hope to use the drama troupe to carry out propaganda and education work, and instructed the drama troupe to write short plays combined with the factory's central work, and use the site to carry out propaganda and mobilization work anytime and anywhere.
　　Our factory's drama troupe now has more than seventy people. There are full-time and part-time heads, secretaries, stage managers, general affairs, directors, actors, full-time and part-time group leaders, etc., with division of labor. Since liberation, it has performed fifteen or six times. Each time there are more than a thousand viewers, which is very popular.

　　七十兵工厂的剧团是怎样发展起来的？
    郭茂林　张世荣
    北京解放后，工人由被压迫者变成了工厂的主人，职工们对于文化娱乐感到迫切的需要。解放初期，在工作组的协助下，七十兵工厂成立了秧歌队、阅览室，工人们开始了正当的文化娱乐活动，在看过文工团演出的《夫妻识字》等剧后，工人们就进一步提出了成立剧团的要求。本来，工厂里是有好些事情可以搬上舞台的。最初，领导上考虑到“成立剧团没有多少人参加怎么办呢？”工友们很乐观地说：“有人，多的很！”领导上又考虑到：“谁来辅导呢？”经与市总工会接洽，介绍来我厂几位文工团的同志。这样，问题解决了，我厂于去年四月份成立了自己的剧团。辅导的同志们都很热心地帮助我们，他们和剧团的同志们在一起生活与工作；和团员们一同搜集材料。在写作技术方面，辅导同志给了剧团很大帮助。“解放了的兵工厂”这一话剧，就是我厂剧团的最初集体创作。
    我们工厂没有礼堂。为纪念“五一”，曾在国子监搭起了台子。第一次演出了“解放了的兵工厂”及天津文艺处出版的“钥匙在谁手里”。一般人对这次的演出都有很好的评价。但有人对舞台布幕、灯光、道具提出了批评：“这得多少钱！太浪费！”这以前，剧团有些同志也傲慢自大，脱离群众。剧团的内部在演出方面，有的人只从兴趣出发，甚至不喜欢演自己的戏，想演“大场戏”。他们忽略了自己是业余剧团。
    市总工会文教部发现了我们厂剧团所存在的缺点，及群众对剧团的批评，在团员大会上指示，并提出“戏剧必须与生产结合，剧团职员必须正派认真”的口号。这样，我们便开始整理组织，一小部分极佻皮的不愿认真学习的退出了，真正热心工作的廿五六位演员们，表示有决心把剧团搞好。结合工厂转业时的混乱现象，我们自编自导演出了独幕剧《站稳阶级立场》，安定了一部分人的不安情绪。在比较顺利的工作中，剧团增加了信心，并感到演自己的戏的重要；接着给大家介绍了一些剧本，书报，造成了创作热潮。在北京市工人联合演出时，大家就分工合作，搜集了本厂生产竞赛中坏汽锤的故事，集体写成了《生产长一寸》剧本，在联合演出时被评为“工人文艺的旗帜”。
    我们剧团缺少女演员，在演出上增加了很大困难。最后，我们想出了办法——发动职工眷属。我们试着去到眷属宿舍商量这个事情。出乎意外，本厂工友杜绩泽的母亲，已经五十岁了，她很慷慨地答应下来，接着她又发动了王俊贞、石维贤的老婆等。这样我们剧团便顺利地演出了有女角参加的《星期那一天》、《认清朋友》及《愈》、《开支》等。另外，我们剧团也掌握了批评与自我批评的武器，这样，我们改造了一两个脾气古怪、个人英雄主义很浓厚的同志。这对演出上也是一个收获。
    我们厂的副厂长，文教部部长都很关心剧团的成长。最近，他们指出剧团活动的方向，给我们很大的鼓励。行政和工会也都希望能利用剧团来进行宣传教育工作，指示剧团应写出与本厂中心工作结合的短剧，利用现场，随时随地进行宣传鼓动工作。
    我们厂的剧团，现在已有七十多人。有正、副团长、秘书、剧务、总务、编导、演员、正副组长等分工。由解放迄今，已演出十五、六次。每次观众一千多人，很受欢迎。
