　　The Zhang Fengquan Team Learns from the Ma Hengchang Production Team
    By our reporter Lán Cūn
    The Zhang Fengquan Team, a lathe group in the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, achieved particularly remarkable production results in the factory's Red May competition. The team completed the production tasks for the entire month of May and the first half of June in twenty-six days; the product quality all met specifications; and not a single defective product was produced since May. This is the result of the team learning from the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Team of the Shenyang No. 5 Machine Factory.
    The Zhang Fengquan Team has a total of thirteen people—seven technicians, two helpers, and four female apprentices. The youngest is seventeen years old, and the oldest is twenty-seven years old. Each and every one of them is an energetic and enterprising young worker.
    Before May, the team was still a rather disorganized group. In production, everyone did their own thing, and no one took care of anyone else. When technician Xian Jinghua made the first batch of waterwheel transverse shafts, the products did not meet specifications. Technician Li Xiaoqi saw it but didn't say anything, fearing to offend him; even team leader Zhang Fengquan was embarrassed to interfere. The relationship between masters and apprentices was not close enough. The apprentices were all female workers, and the masters feared that they could not endure hardship, so they were not strict when teaching them. In fact, these female apprentices were all eager to make progress. Individual workers feared that increasing production would mean more work, and they made sarcastic remarks to the activists in the team.
    In late April, Zhao Guoyou, the nationally renowned production model, came to the factory to report on his experience in creating new production records. In early May, comrades from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions were sent to specifically help the Zhang Fengquan Team learn from the Ma Hengchang Team. These two events greatly encouraged the workers of the Zhang Fengquan Team. They thought: If Zhao Guoyou can create new records, and the Ma Hengchang Team can regularly exceed production plans, why can't we? At this time, the comrades of the trade union patiently educated them, and the factory also began to establish a system of material rewards. They further realized that improving production benefits both the country and themselves. They were determined to learn from the Ma Hengchang Team. After everyone's discussion, they formulated ten labor covenants based on the specific situation of their team, covering labor discipline, master-apprentice obligations, and technical mutual assistance, and posted them on the wall of the team.
    In the first few days, everyone could not earnestly implement the covenants. At the first criticism meeting, everyone sincerely and frankly made self-criticisms. Xian Jinghua said that his work did not meet specifications because he was unwilling to ask others. Li Xiaoqi criticized himself for not being willing to speak up when he saw that others' production did not meet specifications, because he lacked a sense of responsibility. Through criticism and self-criticism, everyone's understanding was unified. Everyone realized that their skills were not good enough, and they needed to help each other to make progress. Everyone said: In the past, everyone did their own thing, and there was very little mutual help. In the future, we should take out the skills we have, study together, and learn from each other. Learning more skills is good for production. The individual who liked to make sarcastic remarks also woke up with everyone's help and guaranteed that he would no longer say discouraging words. Criticism meetings were held one after another, and everyone's relationship became closer and closer.
    On the basis of unity and mutual assistance, all the workers of the Zhang Fengquan Team wholeheartedly studied how to improve production technology and working methods. Whenever they received a new batch of work, they would first study who was most familiar with this kind of work and who was most suitable to do it. In the past, to make a piece of work, from rough material to finished product, every production process was done by one person. For example, to make a waterwheel vertical shaft, it had to go through five steps and five machines, and each person only made five per day. Since changing to two people working separately, the time spent changing machines was reduced, and each person made seven per day; then it was changed to three people working separately, and the output increased to ten per person per day. Later, it was even increased to nineteen. In the past, everyone did their own thing. When a machine broke down, they couldn't produce, and they had to work overtime. After division of labor and mutual assistance, no matter whose machine had a problem, as long as everyone worked hard, the problem could be solved. In terms of master-apprentice teaching, the method of all the masters in the team teaching all the apprentices was implemented. Whoever had the best technique in that area would teach that technique. It was self-reported and publicly discussed, and the entire team decided. The masters also discussed with each other beforehand to ensure that every technical problem was clearly understood before teaching it to the apprentices. This approach broke the traditional concept that one's own apprentice should not be taught by others, and the apprentices could learn the strengths of each master. In terms of improving tools, considerable achievements were also made because the system of studying technology every noon was strictly implemented. In mid-May, Deputy Team Leader Huang Runping reformed the tool for making axle bearing tiles, increasing the output of axle bearing tiles from twenty per person per day to one hundred and eighty. In terms of ensuring quality, the team strictly checked the first product of each kind of work to prevent the production of defective products. In terms of labor discipline and care for machines, the entire team could consciously abide by and implement them. Since May, there have been no violations of discipline or machine accidents.

　　向马恒昌生产小组学习的张凤泉小组
    本报记者  蓝村
    华北农业机械总厂车工间张凤泉小组，在该厂红五月竞赛中，生产成绩特别显著。该组以二十六天的时间，完成了五月全月及六月上半月的生产任务；产品质量都合乎规格；五月以来没出过一件废品。这是该组学习了沈阳第五机器厂马恒昌小组先进生产经验的结果。
    张凤泉小组一共十三个人——七个技工，两个帮匠，四个女学徒。年龄最小的十七岁，最大的二十七岁。一个个都是生气勃勃，勇于进取的青年工人。
    五月以前，该组还是一个相当散漫的小组。在生产当中，各做各的，谁也不照顾谁。技工咸景华做第一批水车横轴活，产品不合规格。技工李效奇看见了也不说，怕得罪人；组长张凤泉也不好意思管。师徒之间的关系不够密切。学徒都是女工，师傅怕她们吃不了苦，教的时候不严格，其实，这几个女学徒都是迫切要求进步的。个别工人怕产量提高了要多干活，对组内积极分子说风凉话。
    四月下旬，全国著名的生产模范赵国有，到该厂报告他创造生产新纪录的经验。五月初，市总工会派来工作同志具体帮助张凤泉小组向马恒昌小组学习。这两件事情，大大鼓舞了张凤泉小组的工人们。他们想：赵国有能创造新纪录，马恒昌小组能经常超过生产计划，我们为什么不能？这时，工会工作同志耐心教育他们，厂内又开始建立了物质奖励制度，他们进一步认识到提高生产对国家对自己都有利益。他们决心向马恒昌小组学习。经过大家讨论，他们针对着本组的具体情况，从劳动纪律、师徒义务、技术互助等方面，订出十条劳动公约，贴在小组的墙壁上。
    最初几天，大家还不能认真执行公约。开了第一次检讨会，大家诚恳坦白地作了检讨。咸景华说他做活不合规格，是因为自己不愿问人。李效奇检讨他看到别人生产不合规格，不愿说，是责任心不够。经过批评与自我批评，大家的认识统一了。都觉悟到自己的技术不够，要互相帮助才能进步。大家都说：过去各人干各人的，彼此帮助很少，今后应当把自己会的技术拿出来，共同研究，互相学习。本事学多了，对生产有好处。个别爱说风凉话的人，在大家的帮助之下，也觉悟了，保证以后不再说泄气话。检讨会一次次地开下去，大家的关系越来越密切。
    在团结互相的基础上，张凤泉小组的全体工人，一心一意研究如何改进生产技术与工作方法。他们每当接到一批新活，就先研究，谁对这种活最熟习，分配给谁做最适当。过去做一件活，从荒料到成品，每一个生产过程，都是一个人做。如做一个水车立轴，要经过五道手，换五次机器，每人每天只做五个。自从改成二人分工做以后，减少了换机器的时间，每人每天做到七个；再改成三人分工做，产量提高到每人每天作十个。以后，更提高到十九个。过去各做各的，遇到机器坏了，出不了活，就得加夜班。分工互助以后，无论谁的机器有了障碍，只要大家努一把力，就解决了问题。师徒教学方面，实行了全组师傅教全组徒弟的办法，谁的那一种技术最好，谁就教那一种，自报公议，全组决定。师傅们事先并互相讨论，务使技术上的每一个问题都弄得很清楚了，然后教给徒弟。这样作法，打破了过去自己的徒弟不让别人教的传统观念，每个师傅的长处，徒弟都可以学到。在改进工具方面，因为严格地执行了每天中午研究技术的制度，也获得了相当成绩。五月中，副组长黄润平改造了做车轴承瓦的工具，使车轴承瓦的产量，从每人每天做二十个提高到一百八十个。在保证质量方面，该组严格检查每种活计的第一个产品，防止了废品的产生。在劳动纪律与爱护机器方面，全组都能自觉地遵守和实行。五月份以来，没有发生违反纪律及机器事故。
