　　Fully Lead Summer Harvest and Planting
    (I)
    The wheat harvest season has arrived in various parts of the country, moving from south to north. According to reports from all sides, with the exception of individual areas that have suffered crop failures due to waterlogging, hailstorms, and pests, most parts of the country have had a good wheat harvest this year. This is a significant victory on the agricultural production front this year. This is good news for both farmers (especially disaster victims) and urban industrialists and businesspeople who need the purchasing power of farmers. In wheat-growing areas, summer planting follows the summer harvest. Doing a good job in summer planting will lay the foundation for striving for a good autumn harvest.
    This year's summer harvest and planting are being carried out on a national scale. This is an arduous and intense task. People's governments and Communist Party leadership organs at all levels must use their main strength to lead the first summer harvest after the national victory, striving to complete the tasks of harvesting, cutting, threshing, drying, storing, and paying agricultural taxes in a very short period of time without missing the farming season. Ensure that every grain of wheat is harvested completely and undamaged, avoid all possible damage, and promptly shift to summer planting after the summer harvest is over. Summer harvest and planting are the central tasks in wheat-growing areas, and all other work in rural areas in wheat-growing areas should be subordinate to or coordinated with this task.
    The most urgent task in the current summer harvest is to pay attention to protecting the wheat. The vast majority of farmers demand the establishment of a good and stable production order so that they can smoothly carry out the summer harvest and planting. In some wheat-producing areas, activities by bandits, special agents, and reactionary secret societies to sabotage the wheat harvest have been discovered. They have adopted methods such as burning wheat, cutting green wheat, and organizing theft in order to undermine farmers' production, causing many farmers to worry about the summer harvest and planting. Therefore, in areas where remaining bandits may carry out sabotage and disturbances, all people's armed forces should be mobilized to suppress bandits, and security work should be strengthened to closely monitor all destructive activities of hidden enemies. In disaster areas, which are still in a difficult period of spring famine that has not yet been completely overcome, it is necessary to prevent social chaos caused by theft or robbery during the wheat ripening period. Before harvesting, all localities should adhere to production and disaster relief work, and solve the food problems of disaster victims through production and disaster relief, and educate disaster victims not to eat green wheat. Only in this way can a good wheat harvest order be established.
    Before and during the wheat harvest, attention must also be paid to preventing various natural disasters, such as floods, wind disasters, and other disasters, so as not to frustrate the wheat harvest work. In short, when a good harvest is in sight, it is necessary to prevent blind optimism and complacency. If we do not act prudently, we will cause unnecessary losses.
    Summer harvest and planting are huge mass movements. The various policies and decrees of the Central People's Government must be correctly implemented in summer production work in order to break down the various concerns of the masses, encourage the production enthusiasm of all classes, and create a mass production upsurge. In the old liberated areas, mass production award campaigns can be launched in the summer. Shanxi and other places have prepared to adopt methods such as comparing summer crops, selecting and evaluating production models, and conducting field selection of seeds. These methods are worth promoting in various places. In areas where land reform was carried out only last winter, the policy of "whoever plants, harvests, and bears the burden" and "protecting the proceeds of labor" should be resolutely implemented. Wheat fields originally sown by landlords and rich peasants and distributed to farmers should be harvested by the original sowing landlords and rich peasants, and taxes should be paid by the harvesters. Wheat fields planted by farmers on rented land that are withdrawn and distributed should be harvested by the original planting farmers, and taxes should be paid by the original planting households. If the land distribution households have processed and invested in the wheat fields, they should negotiate with the original farmers to share the harvest proportionally and bear the burden fairly. In rent reduction areas, it is necessary to ensure rent reduction according to law and the legitimate income of landlords after rent reduction according to law. All new areas should thoroughly publicize the policy of "not touching the land and property of rich peasants" in order to dispel the various concerns of rich peasants and other peasant masses in the new areas about production. After the wheat harvest, the trade companies and cooperatives of the people's governments at all levels should conduct purchases in a timely manner in accordance with the price policies of the Central People's Government to encourage production, so as to promote urban-rural exchanges. However, due to this year's good wheat harvest, in addition to the national trade companies and cooperatives purchasing wheat, all localities should pay attention to organizing merchants to go to the countryside to purchase wheat through joint ventures, and try to bring industrial products to the countryside in various ways to ensure that industrial and agricultural products maintain appropriate price ratios to protect the interests of farmers and urban people and the reasonable profits that merchants should receive. The government's work of exchanging coarse grains needed by farmers for surplus wheat from farmers is beneficial to both the government and farmers, and should be actively carried out after the wheat harvest without missing the opportunity.
    The most basic mass work in leading the summer harvest is to rationally organize labor. Only when labor is organized can the difficulties of labor and animal power in rural areas be solved, and the busy summer production tasks can be completed quickly and effectively. Summer production work is a tense season in rural areas, with many seasonal tasks intertwined and time is very short. Summer harvest and planting are already arduous tasks, while summer planting, summer hoeing, and prevention of pests and diseases are also carried out during the same period. Water-deficient areas should prevent summer droughts, flood-prone areas should prevent summer floods, and disaster areas should pay attention to production and conservation and prevent summer famines after overcoming spring famines. If labor cannot be well organized during this emergency period, and the rural population cannot be organized according to the principles of conscious voluntarism and equivalent exchange, the rural summer production tasks cannot be completed in a timely manner. Not only should labor be organized within a region, but also labor should be adjusted between neighboring regions under possible conditions. Disaster victims fleeing famine should be organized to return home to harvest wheat; those who cannot return home should be organized to participate in summer production work locally (such as doing short-term work, etc.), so that all labor can play a role on the production front. The financial and economic departments and cooperatives of governments at all levels should also cooperate with rural summer production and find ways to supply farmers with various needs during this busy farming season in a timely manner. Some local cooperatives, in order to help farmers with the summer harvest, transport large quantities of salt, matches, and other daily necessities to the countryside. This can save farmers a lot of production time. This practice should also be promoted.
    This year's summer harvest is of great significance to the urban and rural people's economy and to overcoming natural disasters, and all localities must ensure that summer work is done well. After winning a successful summer harvest, we should make persistent efforts to strive for a rich autumn harvest. China has a great agricultural production force. Under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, as long as agricultural productivity is fully mobilized, the state of food shortage in our country can be fundamentally changed, so that the famine caused by possible natural disasters can be fundamentally overcome after a certain period of time. We should work hard for this prospect.

### 全力领导夏收夏播（一）

　　全力领导夏收夏播
    （一）
    全国各地麦收季节已由南而北先后到来。据各方报告，除个别地区遭受水、雹、病虫害等灾歉收外，今年全国大部分地区小麦丰收。这是今年农业生产战线上一个重大的胜利。这无论对于农民（尤其是灾民）或对于需要农民购买力的城市工商业者都是一个喜讯。在种麦地区，夏收之后即是夏播，做好夏播工作，就可以为争取良好的秋收准备基础。
    今年的夏收与夏播是在全国规模上进行的，这是一个繁重而紧张的任务。各级人民政府和共产党的领导机关必须用主要力量领导全国胜利后的第一个夏收，不误农时地争取在极短的时间内完成收、割、打、晒、储及交纳农业税等项工作，保证每一粒麦都能完整无损地收好，避免遭受一切可能的损害，并须在夏收结束后及时转入夏播。夏收和夏播是当前种麦地区的中心工作，种麦区农村其他一切工作都应服从或配合这一个任务。
    当前夏收最紧迫的任务首先是注意护麦。广大农民都要求建立良好而安定的生产秩序，以便他们能够顺利地进行夏收夏播。有些产麦地区，发现了土匪、特务以及反动会门破坏麦收的活动，他们采取烧麦、割青，组织窃盗等办法，以破坏农民的生产，使许多农民对夏收夏播发生了顾虑。因此，在残余土匪可能进行破坏扰乱地区，一切人民武装均应出动剿匪，并须加强治安工作，严密注意隐蔽敌人的一切破坏活动。在灾区，现仍处在春荒困难尚未完全度过时期，在麦熟期间，要防止因偷窃或抢劫而造成的社会混乱。各地在收割前应坚持生产救灾工作，要从生产救灾中解决灾民的口粮问题，教育灾民不要吃青。只有这样，才能建立良好的麦收秩序。
    麦收前与麦收中还须注意防止各种自然的灾害，如水灾、风灾以及其他的灾害，以免使麦收工作受到挫折。总之，在丰收在望的时候，必须防止盲目乐观与麻痹的思想。如果不谨慎从事，将造成不应有的损失。
    夏收夏播是巨大的群众运动。必须在夏季生产工作中正确贯彻中央人民政府各项政策法令，才能打破群众各种顾虑，鼓舞各阶层生产热情，造成群众性的生产热潮。在老解放区，可以在夏季开展群众性的奖励生产运动。山西等地，已准备采取比夏季庄稼、选评增产模范，进行田间选种等办法，这些办法值得各地推广。去冬才进行土地改革地区，应坚决执行“谁种谁收谁负担”，“保护劳动所得”的政策。原由地主富农下种的麦田而分给农民者，应由原下种的地主富农收割，并由收割者纳税。农民承租地所种麦田被抽出分配者，应由原种农民收割，并由原种户纳税。若分地户对麦田有加工投资者，则应按比例和原耕种人协商分收并分别公平负担。在减租地区，应保证依法减租和在依法减租后地主的合法所得。所有新区，都应深入宣传“不动富农土地财产”的政策，以解除新区富农及其他农民群众对生产的各种顾虑。麦收以后，各地人民政府贸易公司及合作社应根据中央人民政府奖励生产的价格政策，及时进行收购，以促进城乡交换。但由于今年小麦丰收，在国家贸易公司和合作社对小麦进行收购之外，各地应注意用联营方式组织商人下乡收购，多方设法使工业品下乡，保证工农业产品维持适当的比价，以保障农民和城市人民的利益及商人应得的合理利润。政府以农民所需的粗粮换农民所多余的小麦的工作，对政府与农民均有利，应在麦收后不失时机地积极进行。
    领导夏收最基本的群众工作是合理组织劳动力。只有劳动力组织起来了，才能解决农村中劳动力与畜力的困难，保证迅速而有效地完成忙迫的夏季生产任务。夏季生产工作，在农村中是一个紧张的季节，许多季节性的工作交织在一起，而且时间甚为短促。夏收夏播已经是繁重的工作，而夏种、夏锄以及防止病虫害，也在同时期内进行；缺水地区要防止夏旱，水灾区要防止夏汛，灾区在克服了春荒之后，还要注意生产节约，防止夏荒。如果不能在这种紧急期间很好地组织劳动力，把农村人口按自觉自愿与等价交换的原则组织起来，是不能及时地完成农村夏季生产任务的。不仅在一个地区中应当组织劳动力，而且在各邻区之间，在可能条件下，应当调剂劳动力。对于逃荒灾民应组织他们还乡收麦；其不能回家者，应组织他们就地参加夏季生产工作（如打短工等），务使一切劳动力都能在生产战线上发挥作用。各地政府财经部门及合作社，亦应配合农村夏季生产，及时想办法来供给农民在这一农忙时节的各种需要。有些地方的合作社，为帮助农民夏收，大量运输盐、火柴等日用品下乡。这就可以为农民节约大量的生产时间。这种作法也应当推广。
    今年夏收，对于城乡人民经济以及战胜灾荒均有重大意义，各地必须保证把夏季工作作好。我们在争取胜利的夏收之后，应再接再厉，争取一个丰富的秋收。中国有伟大的农业生产力量，在中央人民政府正确领导之下，只要把农业生产力充分发动之后，就可以根本改变我们国家的缺粮状态，以至于在一定时间之后，根本克服因可能的灾荒而引起的饥馑。我们应当为这种前途努力。
