　　【Jinan News】Dazhong Daily News: Since late May, prices in various parts of Shandong have shifted from falling to stabilizing, market transactions have gradually become more active, and urban-rural material exchanges have also gradually expanded.

　　Since late May, the sluggish market situation in various parts of Shandong has begun to improve. Taking Jinan City as an example, 534 pieces of cotton yarn were traded, an increase of nearly four times compared to April. In May, 6,438 bolts of white cloth were traded, an increase of nearly six times compared to April. The transaction volume of industrial products in May was also greater than in April, with sodium sulfide increasing by 2.3 times and cooked alkali by 2.5 times. The transaction volume of food grain in April and May was the same. In early June, when new wheat entered the market, the transaction volume of flour also gradually increased. Salt sales also increased due to the reduction of salt tax. In early June, the sales volume of the Jinan Salt Industry Company's store increased by 20% compared to late May. At present, the market price of general commodities is close to or consistent with the listed price. For example, on April 15th in Jinan, the market price of cotton yarn was 480,000 yuan lower than the listed price, and the price of white cloth was 10,000 yuan different per bolt. By May 30th, the market price of cotton yarn was 10,000 yuan lower than the listed price, and the price of white cloth had exceeded the listed price, with the market price and the listed price both being 240,000 yuan per bolt.

　　With the active market, urban-rural material exchanges are becoming more frequent. For example, the total value of goods purchased and sold by Jinan Trust Company on behalf of customers in May increased by nearly one time compared to April. The total value of goods purchased and sold by the Shandong Provincial Cooperative Supply and Marketing Department on behalf of customers in May also increased by 1.1 times compared to April. To this end, the Shandong Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China also rapidly developed its discounting business in May, handling a total of 37 transactions, amounting to 898.14 million yuan, accounting for 48.9% of the total amount of discounting transactions in the past five months. The amount of remittances from various places in May also increased compared to April. The Shandong Provincial Department Store transferred a large number of industrial products to the countryside in May.
