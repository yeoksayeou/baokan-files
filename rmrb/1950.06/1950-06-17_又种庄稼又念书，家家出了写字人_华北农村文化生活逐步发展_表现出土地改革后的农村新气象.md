Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The cultural life of the vast rural areas in the old liberated areas of North China, which have completed land reform, is gradually being established and developed.

The eagerness of farmers in the old North China area to learn culture is best exemplified by the widespread winter schools last winter and the current people's schools this year. In the old North China area, winter schools were held every year during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but the scale of last winter's winter schools and the enthusiasm and seriousness of the farmers' learning attitude were unprecedented. According to statistics from rural areas in Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Pingyuan, and the suburbs of Beijing alone, more than 3.6 million farmers participated in winter schools. In Shanxi Province alone, more than 20,000 winter schools were established, with an average of more than two in each administrative village. Young men and women were particularly enthusiastic about cultural learning. According to statistics from 218 villages in Licheng, Pingshun, and other counties in Shanxi, out of 28,556 young men and women aged 14 to 25, 27,974 attended winter schools to learn culture, accounting for more than 90 percent. After careful study, they can generally recognize about 200 characters, and those with better grades can recognize more than 600 characters and can write daily notes and simple letters.

Because winter schools have met some of the farmers' cultural needs, the farmers' enthusiasm for learning has been further increased. At the end of this spring's winter schools, the farmers who participated in the winter schools asked to continue their studies. In order to adapt to this requirement, the education departments of various provinces in North China have issued instructions in a timely manner, requiring local areas to organize better winter schools to be transformed into perennial people's schools in a planned manner. According to preliminary statistics, among the winter schools in 27 counties and four urban districts of Pingyuan Province, more than 4,500 have been transformed into people's schools, with more than 240,000 farmers attending (Editor's note - According to the latest materials received by this newspaper, 308,102 people have participated in people's schools in 48 counties, five urban districts, and one city in Pingyuan Province); more than 3,000 people's schools have also been established in Shanxi. The number and scale of people's schools in various places have exceeded any previous year. Under the conscious and automatic efforts of the masses, various difficulties in learning have been overcome. Many young people jointly collect firewood and sell it to buy stationery, and women solve the stationery problem by processing textiles.

During the busy spring plowing season, the farmers combine learning and production. They mostly go to the fields during the day and study at night. Some people's schools in Shexian County also use methods such as mobile blackboards and sending characters to study, or small teachers go to various mutual aid groups to assist in learning during rest time. Many young people go to the fields with textbooks, and some women bring lumps of lime and write when they rest, and the edges of the fields and hillsides are covered with writing. "Learn culture, open your minds, and be builders of the new China." This is their universal slogan. Many village people's schools have become the core of rural cultural activities. Learning culture, science, politics, and current affairs has gradually become an indispensable part of farmers' lives. Some elderly people happily say: "Planting crops and studying, now every family has a literate person!" On the basis of the farmers' urgent demand for learning culture, various places have initially formulated plans to eliminate illiteracy. The Department of Culture and Education of the Shanxi Provincial Government proposed to strive to eliminate illiteracy among cadres and young farmers throughout the province in three to five years. Illiteracy elimination and literacy committees have been generally established in various villages in Yuci; Jincheng has designated 45 key villages for illiteracy elimination and leads farmers to carry out cultural learning in a planned manner.

The widespread development of mass literary and artistic activities also fully demonstrates the new atmosphere in rural areas after land reform. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, mass literary and artistic activities in various parts of North China were partially developed, but they were not widespread enough; but now, because land reform has been completed and productivity has been improved, widespread mass literary and artistic activities have truly been developed. This was most evident in this year's Spring Festival entertainment activities. In Shanxi, Hebei, Pingyuan, and other places, farmers wrote, directed, acted, sang, and enjoyed themselves, expressing their joy in various forms of entertainment. According to statistics from Linxian County, Pingyuan alone, more than 400 pieces of clapper talk, drum lyrics, short plays, and songs were written by the masses during this year's Spring Festival. The contents of these creations are mostly to mobilize large-scale production, promote current affairs, and oppose superstition. Farmers use familiar characters and ideas to express their own lives and demands, and some use vivid images to correctly explain the policies of the people's government, which has greatly promoted the large-scale production movement and various construction works. For example, the peasants of Da Li Ge Zhuang in Qingyuan County wrote and performed a play called "Unity and Production", which educated the lazy people in the village who "hoped to eat from the big pot" and enlightened the middle peasants who were afraid of "eating from the big pot", eliminating ideological obstacles to carrying out production. Various cultural and entertainment organizations such as yangko teams and rural theater troupes have also been greatly developed. There are more than 1,800 amateur theater troupes in 42 counties in six special districts, including Baoding, Hebei, most of which are rural theater troupes. The yangko team form is particularly popular among the masses, and old men, old women, and even boys and girls generally participate. There were more than 2,300 yangko teams in Shijiazhuang and Tianjin special districts alone during this year's Spring Festival. These new mass literary and artistic activities have seized and replaced the cultural positions of feudal superstition in most areas, and have significantly changed the rural residual feudal morality and social public opinion. The old dramas and old art that spread feudal and superstitious ideas have also undergone tremendous transformation under this new requirement.

In areas with a better working foundation, such as Wuxiang and Licheng, rural newspaper reading groups and communication groups have also begun to be established. Farmers listen to and read newspapers and talk about national affairs during production gaps. Some village cadres and farmers also often contribute to newspapers to report on production and work in the village. Blackboards are almost in every village, and what the village is currently doing is written on them in a timely manner, becoming a command post for promoting the central work of the entire village.

　　“又种庄稼又念书，家家出了写字人”
    华北农村文化生活逐步发展
    表现出土地改革后的农村新气象
    【新华社十三日讯】完成了土地改革的华北老解放区广大农村的文化生活正逐步建立与发展中。
    华北老区农民对文化学习要求的迫切，去冬冬学与今年民校的广泛开展就是最好的例证。华北老区在抗日战争时期，年年都开办冬学，但去冬冬学规模之大与农民学习情绪之热烈和态度之认真，却为过去所未有。仅据河北、山西、察哈尔、平原及北京市郊农村统计，参加冬学的农民即达三百六十余万。山西一省即建立冬学二万余座，每个行政村平均有两座多。青年男女的文化学习热情尤高，据山西黎城、平顺等县二百一十八个村统计，十四至二十五岁的男女青年二万八千五百五十六人中，入冬学学文化者达二万七千九百七十四人，占百分之九十强。经过认真学习，一般都能认二百字左右，成绩较好的能识六百多字，能写日用便条与简单信件。
    由于冬学满足了农民部分的文化要求，农民学习热情更加提高。在今春冬学结束时，参加冬学的农民纷纷要求继续学习。华北各省教育部门为适应此种要求，都及时发布指示，要各地有计划地组织较好的冬学转为常年民校。据初步统计，平原省二十七个县四个城关区的冬学，已转为民校的有四千五百余座，入校农民达二十四万余人（编者注——据最近本报所收到材料，平原省四十八个县、五个城关区、一个市，参加民校学习的已达三十万八千一百零二人）；山西也已建立民校三千余座。各地民校数量与规模均超过以往任何一年。在群众自觉自动的努力下，学习中的各种困难都得到克服，不少青年合伙打柴卖钱买文具，妇女们以加工纺织来解决文具问题。
    在春耕农忙时，农民们把学习和生产结合起来进行。他们大多白天下地，晚上学习。涉县有些民校并采用流动黑板、送字等办法学习，或由小先生分头到各互助组利用休息时间协助学习。不少青年下地都带着课本，妇女们有些带着石灰块，休息时就写，地边山坡划满了字迹。“学文化，开脑筋，要当新中国的建设人。”这是他们普遍的口号。不少村的民校已成为农村文化活动的核心。学习文化、科学、政治、时事，已逐渐成为农民生活不可缺少的部分。有些老年人乐的说：“又种庄稼又念书，如今真是家家出了写字人啦！”在农民这种迫切要求学习文化的基础上，各地都初步拟定了扫除文盲计划。山西省府文教厅提出三年到五年争取在全省范围内消灭干部及青年农民中的文盲。榆次各村普遍成立了扫盲识字委员会；晋城规定了四十五个扫盲重点村，有计划地领导农民进行文化学习。
    群众文艺活动的普遍开展，也充分表现出土地改革后农村的新气象。在抗日战争时期，华北各地群众文艺活动曾有部分开展，但不够普遍；但现在因为土地改革完成，生产力有了提高，广泛的群众性的文艺活动真正开展起来了。这在今年春节的文娱活动中表现得最为明显。在山西、河北、平原等地，农民自编、自演、自唱、自乐，以各种各样的娱乐形式，来表达他们欢快的心情。仅据平原林县一县统计，今年春节群众自编的快板、鼓词、短剧、歌曲等即达四百余件。这些创作的内容多为动员大生产、宣传时事、反迷信等。农民以他们熟悉的人物与思想，表现他们自己的生活与要求，有些并用生动的形象正确地解释了人民政府的政策，对大生产运动与各种建设工作起了极大推动作用。如清苑县大李各庄农民编演了“团结生产”一剧，教育了该村“盼吃大锅饭”的懒汉，也启发了怕“吃大锅饭”的中农，消除了开展生产的思想障碍。各种文娱组织如秧歌队、农村剧团等也大大发展起来。河北保定等六个专区四十二县即共有业余剧团一千八百多个，其中绝大部分为农村剧团。秧歌队形式尤为广大群众所欢迎，老头、老婆以至男、女儿童普遍参加。仅石家庄、天津两专区今年春节即有秧歌二千三百余班。这些新的群众文艺活动，在大部地区已夺取与代替了封建迷信的文化阵地，使农村残余的封建道德与社会舆论，有了显著的改变。传播封建迷信思想的旧戏剧与旧艺术，在这种新的要求下也有了巨大的改造。
    在工作基础较好的地区，如武乡、黎城等地，农村的读报组、通讯组也已开始建立。农民们于生产空隙听读报，谈论国家大事。有些村干部和农民还常给报纸投稿，报道村中的生产与工作情况。黑板报几乎村村都有，村中当前作什么，就及时写上什么，成为推动全村中心工作的指挥台。
