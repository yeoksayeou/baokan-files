Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 24th: According to TASS, the Soviet Embassy in Iran, on behalf of the Soviet government, delivered a second note to the Iranian government on the 20th, refuting the Iranian government's May 18th reply to the Soviet Union's first note of May 14th, and reiterating its demand that the Iranian government cease activities threatening the Soviet border.

The note declared: The Iranian Oil Joint Stock Company has signed contracts with foreign enterprises, mainly in the northern part of Khorasan province, Gorgan, Mazandaran, and Gilan regions bordering the Soviet Union, to conduct topographic surveying, geological investigations, and aerial photography. The Soviet Union already reminded the Iranian government in its first note that all these activities should not be carried out by foreigners. However, the Iranian government continues these activities of military significance and invites foreign experts, especially American experts, to implement them.

The note pointed out: The statement made by the U.S. State Department spokesperson on May 16th (the same day the Soviet note was published) that the Iranian Oil Joint Stock Company has signed a contract with an American company to drill experimental oil wells in northern Iran, confirms the facts stated in the Soviet note. However, the Iranian government's reply still insisted that the Iranian Oil Company only has a group of hired Swiss experts active, and that at present, exploration work is only being carried out in the southeastern region of Iran. This statement is obviously contradictory to the above-mentioned facts and cannot be considered satisfactory.

The note concluded: The Soviet government believes it is necessary to once again urge the Iranian government to pay attention to the activities threatening the Soviet border, in which foreign, especially American, representatives are participating. These activities are pursuing goals incompatible with the good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Iran as stipulated in the Soviet-Iranian Treaty signed on February 26, 1921.

The Soviet government once again solemnly declares: The Iranian government must take steps to eliminate the abnormal situation that has already occurred.

　　苏再照会伊朗政府
    要求停止威胁苏边境活动
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联驻伊朗大使馆奉苏联政府之命于二十日向伊朗政府提出第二次照会，驳复伊朗政府五月十八日对苏联五月十四日第一次照会的复照，并再度要求伊朗政府停止威胁苏联边境的活动。
    照会宣称：伊朗石油股份公司与外国企业签订合同，主要在与苏联边境接壤的胡拉桑省北部、葛尔干、马桑达朗与吉兰地区，进行地形勘测、地质调查与空中摄影等工作。苏联在第一次照会中即已提醒伊朗政府注意，所有这些工作，不应由外国人进行。但伊朗政府仍继续此种具有军事意义的活动，并招引外国专家，尤其是美国的专家来实行这种活动。
    照会指出：美国国务院发言人于五月十六日（即苏联照会发表的当天）声明，伊朗石油股份公司已与美国公司订立了关于在伊朗北部开凿实验石油井的合同，这证实了苏联照会中所指明的事实。但是，伊朗政府的复照仍强辩称：伊朗石油公司仅有一群被聘的瑞士专家活动，目前，勘察工作仅在伊朗东南部地区进行。此种说法，显然与上述事实互相矛盾，是不能被认为满意的。
    照会末称：苏联政府认为必须再度促请伊朗政府注意威胁苏联边境的活动，是有外国尤其是美国代表们参加的。这种活动正追求着与一九二一年二月二十六日所签订的苏伊条约中所规定的苏伊睦邻关系不能相容的目的。
    苏联政府再度郑重声明：伊朗政府必须采取步骤，以消除现已发生的不正常局势。
