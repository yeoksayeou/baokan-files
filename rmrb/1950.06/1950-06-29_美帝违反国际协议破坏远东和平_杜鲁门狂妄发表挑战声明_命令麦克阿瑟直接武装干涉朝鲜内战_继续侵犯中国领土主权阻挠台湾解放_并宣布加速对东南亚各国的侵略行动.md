Xinhua News Agency, June 28th - According to the United States Information Service, U.S. President Truman issued a statement in Washington on the morning of the 27th, disrupting peace in the Far East and issuing a challenge. He openly announced that he had ordered the air and naval forces under MacArthur to assist the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang in fighting the Korean People's Army. He ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the Pacific to assist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in interfering with the Chinese People's Liberation Army's war to liberate Taiwan. He also announced the acceleration of aggressive actions against Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam. In the statement, Truman disregarded the fact that U.S. imperialism instigated the Li Chengwan bandit gang to launch a full-scale civil war on the 25th and attempted to shift the responsibility for the war launched by the Li Chengwan bandit gang to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, falsely accusing the just counterattack of the Korean People's Army as an "attack by the North Korean invasion army." Truman then openly revealed his true colors of directly intervening militarily in the Korean civil war and, using the illegal decision manipulated by the United States in the Security Council on the 25th as an excuse, ordered the U.S. air and naval forces to provide "cover and support" to the puppet army of the Li Chengwan group. However, it is well known that the Security Council's resolution on the Korean situation on the 25th was made without the participation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the representatives of the two major permanent members of the five permanent member states—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—did not participate in the discussion and voting. Therefore, according to Article 27 of the United Nations Charter, this decision is completely one-sided, illegal, and has no effect whatsoever.

In the statement, Truman completely violated the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration regarding the return of Taiwan and other islands to China, and completely violated the principle of the United Nations Charter that no member state shall violate the territorial integrity and political independence of any country. He brazenly "ordered the Seventh Fleet to prevent any attack on Taiwan." Truman's order not only clearly showed the continued infringement of U.S. imperialism on China's territorial sovereignty but also nakedly exposed the extreme hypocrisy of Truman's own policy statement on China issued on January 5th of this year, and which Acheson had reiterated as late as June 23rd. In this policy statement on China, Truman had boasted that "the United States has no predatory ambitions regarding Taiwan or other Chinese territories... The United States also does not intend to use armed forces to intervene in its current situation... and does not intend to follow any path that would involve the United States in China's internal conflicts." The full text of Truman's statement on June 27 is as follows:

"In Korea, government forces, armed to prevent border raids and maintain internal security, were attacked by invading forces from North Korea.

The United Nations Security Council demanded that the invading forces cease fire and withdraw to the 38th parallel. They have not done so, but have instead intensified their attack. The Security Council has called upon all members of the United Nations to provide the United Nations with all assistance to implement this resolution. Under these circumstances, I have ordered U.S. air and naval forces to provide cover and support to Korean government forces. The attack on Korea has undoubtedly demonstrated that communism is no longer limited to using subversion to conquer independent nations, and will immediately use armed aggression and war. It defied the United Nations Security Council's order to maintain international peace and security. These circumstances, as well as the occupation of Taiwan by communist forces, will directly threaten the security of the Pacific region and the U.S. forces performing legitimate and necessary duties in the region. Therefore, I have ordered the Seventh Fleet to prevent any attack on Taiwan. As a due consequence of this action, I have asked the Chinese government in Taiwan to cease all air and sea attacks on the mainland. The Seventh Fleet will oversee the implementation of this matter. The determination of the future status of Taiwan must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations. I have also directed the strengthening of U.S. forces in the Philippines and the acceleration of military assistance to the Philippine government. I have also directed the acceleration of military assistance to the French and member states' forces in Indochina and the dispatch of a military mission to establish close working relations with these forces. I know that all members of the United Nations will carefully consider the consequences of this recent act of aggression in Korea in violation of the United Nations Charter. The restoration of strong rule in international affairs will have widespread implications. The United States will continue to support the rule of law. I have instructed Ambassador Austin, the U.S. representative to the Security Council, to report these steps to the Security Council."

### 美帝违反国际协议破坏远东和平  杜鲁门狂妄发表挑战声明  命令麦克阿瑟直接武装干涉朝鲜内战  继续侵犯中国领土主权阻挠台湾解放  并宣布加速对东南亚各国的侵略行动

　　美帝违反国际协议破坏远东和平
    杜鲁门狂妄发表挑战声明
    命令麦克阿瑟直接武装干涉朝鲜内战
    继续侵犯中国领土主权阻挠台湾解放
    并宣布加速对东南亚各国的侵略行动
    【新华社二十八日讯】据美国新闻处消息，美国总统杜鲁门于二十七日上午在华盛顿发表了一个破坏远东和平与挑战的声明，公然宣布他已命令麦克阿瑟所统率的海空军，协助李承晚匪帮，参加对朝鲜人民军的作战，命令美国驻太平洋第七舰队协助蒋介石匪帮，干涉中国人民解放军解放台湾的战争，并宣布加速对菲律宾、越南等东南亚国家的侵略行动。杜鲁门在该声明中，不顾美帝国主义指使李承晚匪帮于二十五日首先发动全面内战的事实，力图把李承晚匪帮发动战争的责任，转嫁于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，诬蔑朝鲜人民军的正义反攻为“北朝鲜进犯军的攻击”。杜鲁门继即公开露出其直接武装干涉朝鲜内战的真面目，并以安理会二十五日以美国操纵的非法决定为借口，命令美国的空、海部队，给予李承晚集团的伪军以“掩护及支持”。然而尽人皆知，安理会二十五日关于朝鲜局势的决议，既没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加，而五个常任理事国中的两大常任理事国——苏联和中华人民共和国代表，也没有参加讨论与表决。因此，按照联合国宪章第二十七条的规定，这种决定完全是片面的，非法的，没有任何效力的。
    杜鲁门在该声明中，完全违反了开罗宣言、波茨坦宣言关于台湾等岛交还中国的决定，完全违反了联合国宪章关于任何会员国不得侵害任何国家领土完整与政治独立的原则，悍然“命令第七舰队阻止对台湾的任何攻击”。杜鲁门这一命令，不但明白地表示了美帝国主义对中国领土主权的继续侵犯，而且也赤裸裸地揭穿了杜鲁门自己于今年一月五日发表的、并为艾奇逊直至六月二十三日还加以重申的对华政策声明的极端虚伪性。杜鲁门在这个对华政策声明中，曾扬言“美国对台湾或中国其他领土，从无掠夺野心。……美国亦不拟使用武装部队干预其现在的局势，……不拟遵循任何足以把美国卷入中国内争的途径”。杜鲁门六月二十七日声明的全文如下：
    “在朝鲜，为了防止边境袭击及维持国内治安而武装起来的政府部队，遭到北朝鲜的进犯军的攻击。
    联合国安理会要求进犯军停战，并撤退至三八线。他们没有这样做，相反地反而加紧进攻。安理会要求联合国的所有会员国给予联合国一切援助以执行此决议。在这些情况下，我已命令美国的空海部队给予朝鲜政府部队以掩护及支持。对朝鲜的攻击已无可怀疑地说明，共产主义已不限于使用颠覆手段来征服独立国家，而且立即会使用武装的进攻与战争。它违抗了联合国安理会为了保持国际和平与安全而发出的命令。这些情况以及共产党部队的占领台湾，将直接威胁太平洋地区的安全，及在该地区执行合法而必要职务的美国部队。因此，我已命令第七舰队阻止对台湾的任何攻击。作为这一行动的应有结果，我已要求台湾的中国政府停止对大陆的一切空海攻击。第七舰队将监督此事的实行。台湾未来地位的决定，必须等待太平洋安全的恢复，对日和约的缔结，或联合国的考虑。我并已指示加强美国在菲律宾的部队，及加速对菲政府的军事援助。我同样也已指示加速以军事援助供给在印度支那的法国及成员国的部队，并派遣军事使团以便与这些部队建立密切工作关系。我知道联合国的一切会员国将仔细考虑最近这一在朝鲜的违反联合国宪章的侵略行为的后果。在国际事务中恢复强力统治将有广泛影响。美国将继续支持法律统治。我已训令美国驻安理会代表奥斯汀大使向安理会报告这些步骤。”
