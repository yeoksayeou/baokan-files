Xinhua News Agency, London, June 10th: The *Daily Worker* published an article by Palme Dutt, Vice-Chairman of the British Communist Party's Executive Committee. The author condemned the British Labour government for using heavy bombers, jet fighters, flamethrowers, etc., to respond to the Malayan people's demands for freedom. The author pointed out: Tens of thousands of Malayan people have been executed, exiled, or imprisoned in concentration camps. Their villages have been bombed and razed, and even civilians suspected of giving guerrillas food and shelter have been sentenced to death. The article revealed that while the British colonialists declared the All-Malaya Federation of Trade Unions, with 300,000 members, illegal, they used a "constitution" to deceive the Malayan people, attempting to whitewash their notorious "democracy." The so-called "Legislative Council of the Federation of Malaya" established under this "constitution" did not have a single elected member. In conclusion, the author urged the British people to rise up and demand an end to the criminal colonial war in Malaya.

The *Daily Worker* also reprinted a letter from the American progressive leader and Black singer Paul Robeson to the British "Committee of Mothers of Enlisted Soldiers." The letter stated: The Malayan people are fighting to handle their own affairs and live a decent life free from exploitation. Sending conscripted young soldiers to suppress them is to make British youth accomplices in criminal acts. Robeson concluded: "No one can gain anything from this war except the imperialists who exploit the Malayan and British people."

　　英工人日报号召英国人民反对英政府进行殖民战争
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十日电：《工人日报》刊载英共执行委员会副主席杜德的一篇论文。作者谴责英国工党政府以重轰炸机，喷气式战斗机、喷火器等，来回答马来亚人民争取自由的要求。作者指出：数以万计的马来亚人民遭到处决、放逐，或被囚于集中营中。他们的村落被炸毁、夷平，甚至被怀疑给游击队以粮食和住屋的平民也被判处死刑。论文揭露：英国殖民者一面宣布拥有三十万会员的全马来亚总工会为非法，一面却以“宪法”来欺骗马来亚人民，企图粉饰恶名昭彰的所谓“民主”。根据这个“宪法”设立的所谓“马来联合邦立法委员会”中却没有一个选举出来的委员。作者在结语中敦促英国人民起来。要求结束罪恶的马来亚殖民战争。
    《工人日报》并转载了美国进步领袖、黑人歌王保罗·罗伯逊寄给英国“入伍士兵母亲委员会”的一封信。信中写道：马来亚人民正在为争取处理他们自己的事务，和能过不受剥削的合理生活而斗争。把征来的青年士兵送去镇压他们，就是叫英国青年去做罪恶行为的同谋者。罗伯逊最后指出：“除了剥削马来亚和英国人民的帝国主义者，没有人能在这个战争中得到什么”。
