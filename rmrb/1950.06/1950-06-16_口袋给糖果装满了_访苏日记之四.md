　　Pockets Filled with Candy
    —Diary of a Visit to the Soviet Union, No. 4
    Zhao Guoyou
    On the afternoon of May 9th, our Chinese delegation took cars to visit the Mikoyan Candy Factory in Leningrad. According to our request, the factory director first gave us an introduction to the factory's production situation. He said: "More than 90 percent of the factory's staff are young female workers. The factory manufactures more than two hundred kinds of candies. The factory exceeds the production plan every month. The production volume in the first quarter of this year exceeded the production volume in the second quarter of last year by 48 percent….” As soon as the factory director finished the introduction, a female worker brought white clothes specially for visitors and asked us to change into them. Then, the factory director led us to visit the various workshops where candy was made.
    As we stepped into the door of the first workshop, we saw the large candy-making machines, with the candies automatically running upstairs. Everyone was very curious and naturally followed the candies upstairs, wanting to see what was going on. When we got upstairs, the worker sisters warmly waved and cheered at us. They surrounded us, vying to talk to us and stuffing candy into our pockets. We were overwhelmed and had to respond with repeated nods. The translation comrade couldn't keep up with the translation and was sweating profusely. I used the newly learned Russian phrase, "Niebaniemaju" (meaning "I don't understand"), to answer them, which made everyone laugh. As we were about to leave this workshop, an elderly female worker even squeezed into the crowd, grabbing our hands and asking all sorts of questions. She was concerned about the lives and work of Chinese working women, which touched us very much.
    Later, we went to another candy-making workshop, and we were again surrounded by enthusiastic applause. A female worker squeezed in, holding a plate of candy. After giving us the candy, she raised a small wine glass and said to the translator, "This is a small wine glass made of candy, a toast to Chairman Mao's health!" Then dozens of small wine glasses were raised, and everyone toasted. We squeezed back and forth in the crowd, finally reaching the door of the front workshop. They seemed to have known we were thirsty and had already prepared a lot of tea for us to drink. The translator suddenly said to us, "Is it okay if they kiss you?" After we replied that it was okay, there was a burst of "baba" kissing sounds.
    When we left, they shouted and jumped. We looked back and saw several comrades standing there in a daze, tears rolling down their faces. Some wiped their faces with their sleeves.
    After we visited the various workshops, the factory director led us back to the director's office. As soon as we entered, we saw a table full of rich refreshments, and the responsible comrades of the factory's Party, government, and trade union were all present. The reception comrades kindly asked us this and that. Especially the Youth League secretary, when she heard that I was a Youth League member, seemed even more affectionate to me, constantly asking about the study and work of Chinese youth. At the time of departure, I asked her to introduce more experiences of Soviet youth work, and she readily said, "I will definitely help." We also exchanged mailing addresses. She smiled and said to me, "You must write to me! If you don't write, I will scold you!" Another old lady heard this and said to her with a smile, "I'm going to tell your husband that you are corresponding with Chinese youth." This made everyone laugh.
    We were far away in the car when we left, and they were still waving. After returning to the hotel, we found that everyone's pockets were filled with candy.

　　口袋给糖果装满了
    ——访苏日记之四
    赵国有
    五月九日下午，我们中国代表团乘着小汽车去参观列宁格勒米高扬糖果工厂。该厂厂长根据我们的要求，首先将该厂生产情况给我们介绍了一番。他说：“厂里工作人员百分之九十以上是青年女工。全厂制造二百多种糖果。该厂每月都超过生产计划。本年度第一季超过去年第二季生产量百分之四十八……。”厂长刚介绍完毕，一位女工送来专给参观人穿的白衣服叫我们换上。接着，厂长便引我们去参观做糖的各个工作间。
    我们跨进第一个车间的门，就看见做糖的大机器，做出来的糖果自动往楼上跑。大家很奇怪，也自然而然地跟着糖果走到楼上，想看看究竟是怎么一回事。到了楼上，那些工人姐妹们都亲热地向我们招手、欢呼。他们把我们围了起来，你一句、她一句争着给我们讲话，争着向我们口袋里塞糖。我们应付不暇，只好以连连的点头代替答复。翻译同志来不及翻译，急的满头大汗。我就用新学的一句俄文：“聂巴呢马尤”（不懂的意思）回答她们，引得大家都笑起来。当我们要离开这个车间时，一位老年女工，还挤到人群里扯着我们的手问长问短。她关心着中国劳动妇女生活及工作情形，使我们非常感动。
    后来，我们走到另一个造糖果的车间去，仍然是在一阵热烈的掌声中被围了。一位女工托着一盘子糖挤进来。把糖送给我们后，她举起小酒杯对翻译说：“这是用糖果做成的小酒杯，为毛泽东身体健康干一杯！”于是数十只小酒杯都高举起来，大家干杯。我们在人群中挤来挤去，好容易走到前场车间门。她们好像早已知道我们渴了，已经准备了很多茶水叫我们喝。翻译忽然向我们说：“她们要亲嘴可以吗？”在我们回答可以后，就来了一阵叭叭的亲嘴声音。
    离开时，她们又叫又跳。我们回头一看，有几个同志发呆似的站在那里，泪珠滚在脸上。有的用袖子擦。
    我们参观了各工作车间后，厂长又引着我们回到厂长室。一进门看见满桌摆着丰富的茶点，该厂的党政工团负责同志都在座。招待同志亲切的问我们这，问我们那。尤其是那位青年团书记，她听说我是青年团员，好像对我更亲切，不断地询问咱们中国青年的学习和工作情况。在离别的时候，我要求她多介绍些苏联青年工作的经验、她很爽快的说：“一定帮助。”我们又交换了通讯处。她笑着对我说：“你要给我来信啊！要不来信，我要骂你！”另一个老太太听见了就和她笑着说：“我要告诉你当家的，你和中国青年通信。”惹的大家都笑了。
    我们上车离开很远了，她们还在招手。回到旅馆后，发现每个人的口袋都被糖果塞满了。
