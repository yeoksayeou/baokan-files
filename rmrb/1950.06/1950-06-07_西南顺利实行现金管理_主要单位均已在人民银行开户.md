Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 31st: The implementation of cash management in various parts of the Southwest is progressing well. The vast majority of key units in provinces and regions that should implement cash management have opened accounts at the local People's Bank.

Other major units in Guizhou, Yunnan, Xikang and other places have also opened accounts at the People's Bank.

Due to the smooth implementation of cash management, the deposit figures of People's Banks in various regions have surged.

The deposits of public enterprises and organizations in Chongqing were only 70.7 billion yuan at the end of March, but increased to 277.8 billion yuan by May 10th.

By April, cash receipts and payments had decreased to 11.6%, and transfers had increased to 88.4%.

    【新华社重庆三十一日电】西南各地实行现金管理情形良好。各省、区重点城市应实行现金管理单位绝大多数已向当地人民银行开户。重庆三百七十七个单位中已在银行开户的即有三百零九个单位。川北省级单位在人民银行开户者占总数百分之九十以上。其他如贵阳、云南、西康等地各主要单位均已向人民银行开户。
