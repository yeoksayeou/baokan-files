　　Urban Real Estate Should Not Be Divided Equally
    Li Youbai's House Should Be Returned or Compensated
    To the Editor:
    My family has lived in Xiguan Street, Xingtai, for generations. We have fifteen people in the family and seventy-nine rooms (half inherited from ancestors and half self-built). We also have four mu of land connected to the house. My father and older brother are both businessmen. The family relies on renting out the house to support our livelihood. In 1949, Beijing was peacefully liberated, and I was assigned to the 4th Detachment of the Railway Corps of the Ministry of Railways as an administrator. Three of my nephews also serve in the Railway Corps. There are eleven people in my family, all elderly, weak, women, and children, and their lives are very difficult. Last March, I sent my eldest brother, sister-in-law, and granddaughter back to Xiguan, Xingtai. The municipal government temporarily found three rooms for my brother and sister-in-law, but the property rights have not been determined. Section Chief Liu of the Municipal Government said: "Your family's house and land were distributed during the land reform. However, when correcting the errors, no one from your family was present. We will find a way to deal with it later!" I took leave twice last December and this January to go home to negotiate, but Section Chief Li of the Prefectural Commissioner's Office and Section Chief Han of the Municipal Government shirked responsibility and refused to resolve the issue. Later, I sent a letter to inquire, but received no reply. My older brother personally inquired with Section Chief Han, but also received no result. According to the central government's urban policy, real estate should not be divided equally. Xingtai City should be no exception. How should the wrongly distributed real estate be corrected? I hope the editor can provide an answer.
            Li Youbai, 4th Detachment, Railway Corps, Shijiazhuang
    Editor's Note: If the situation described in Li Youbai's letter is true, his property should be returned or appropriately compensated in other ways.

　　城市房产不应平分
    李友白的房屋应发还或予补偿编辑同志：
    我家世居邢台西关街。家中有十五口人，房子七十九间（祖遗及自建各半）。另有地四亩与房子相连。父亲哥哥都是商人。家中靠出租房子维持家庭生活。一九四九年北京和平解放，我被编入铁道部铁道兵团四支队，任管理员工作。还有三个侄子，也在铁道兵团服务。家中还有十一口人。都是老弱妇孺，生活很困难。去年三月间，我把大哥大嫂同孙女送回邢台西关。市政府暂给我兄嫂找了三间住房，但产权未定。市府刘科长说：“你家的房子与地，在土地改革时均被分配出去了。但纠偏时，你家没有人在场。等以后再想办法吧！”我于去年十二月和今年一月，曾两次请假回家交涉，专署李科长与市府韩科长互相推诿，不给解决。后复去信询问，亦无答复。又由家兄亲询韩科长，亦未获结果。按中央人民政府城市政策的规定：房产是不应平分的。邢台市当不在例外。被错分之房地，应如何纠正？盼编者给予答复。

    编者按：李友白君来信所说情况如果属实，其房产应该退还或采取其他方式予以适当补偿。
