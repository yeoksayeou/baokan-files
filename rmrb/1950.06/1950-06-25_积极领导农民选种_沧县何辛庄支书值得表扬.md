　　Actively Leads Farmers in Seed Selection
    He Xinzhuang Branch Secretary of Cang County Deserves Praise
    Ding Jinqi, the Chinese Communist Party Branch Secretary of He Xinzhuang Village in Cang County, Hebei Province, actively led farmers in selecting seeds and achieved excellent results. Last autumn, farmers in the village did not prepare wheat seeds due to financial difficulties. When it came time to sow wheat, some borrowed seeds from other places, while others bought them temporarily at the market. As a result, the wheat that grew this year was very mixed, often with three or four varieties in one field. Furthermore, the farmers in the village had no habit of selecting seeds in the past, making the seed selection work very difficult. This year, the government called for wheat seed selection. When the village discussed how to mobilize farmers to select seeds at a meeting of village cadres, Comrade Ding Jinqi said that the women in the village had the habit of "sorting wheat stalks" (selecting wheat stalks to braid straw hat braids), so this habit could be used to carry out seed selection. He called on farmers to remove mixed ears and select good, pure seeds separately for threshing when "sorting stalks." Everyone agreed with Comrade Ding Jinqi's opinion.
    Subsequently, the village held mass meetings to mobilize the masses to carry out seed selection work. At the meeting, some farmers said, "My wheat is mixed, short, and has small ears. It's really impossible to select." Considering the difficulties of the masses and recalling that his own wheat grew relatively well, Comrade Ding Jinqi said to everyone, "If your wheat is not good and cannot be selected, you can go to my field to select. I planted Xiaohongmang wheat." He also declared: one jin for one jin. This fair exchange method helped farmers select seeds, which satisfied everyone.
    At the end of the seed selection work, out of 127 households in the village, 78 households participated in seed selection, selecting a total of 2,889 jin of seeds, which can be sown on 269 mu of land. This accounts for 48 percent of the 556 mu of land in the village that is prepared for wheat this year.
    He Xinzhuang was a heavily flooded area last year, and farmers faced many difficulties in production. In March of this year, the Hebei Provincial Cang County Farm came to the village to promote the improved millet variety "Huanong No. 4." The farmers in the village welcomed this millet variety, but they did not have the means to exchange for the seeds. Knowing the farmers' difficulties, Comrade Ding Jinqi lent the remaining part of his rice to everyone to exchange for improved seeds. A total of more than ten households borrowed 80 jin of rice from him and exchanged it for 100 jin of "Huanong No. 4" millet seeds, which were sown on nearly 70 mu of land. Thanks to Comrade Ding Jinqi's leadership and assistance, the village laid the foundation for further promotion of improved varieties next year.

　　积极领导农民选种
    沧县何辛庄支书值得表扬
    河北沧县何辛庄，中共支部书记丁金起，积极领导农民选种，获得很好的成绩。去年秋季，该村农民因为生活困难，没有准备麦种。到了种麦时，有的人向其他地方借种籽；有的人到集市上临时购买。所以今年长出的小麦很杂，往往一块地里有三、四样品种。并且该村农民过去没有选种习惯，选种工作很不易进行。今年政府号召小麦选种。该村在村干部会议上讨论如何发动农民进行选种时，丁金起同志说，该村妇女都有“缕麦梃子”（选取麦秆，用来编草帽辫）的习惯，因此可以利用这种习惯进行选种。他号召农民在“缕梃子”时，把杂穗去掉，选好的纯良麦种，分开脱粒。大家都赞成丁金起同志的意见。
    随后该村即分别召开群众会，号召群众进行选种工作。会上，有些农民说：“我的麦子又杂、又矮、穗子又小，真没法选。”丁金起同志考虑到群众的困难，同时想起自己的麦子长得比较好。他便向大家说：“你们的麦子不好，选不出来，可以到我的场里去选。我种的是小红芒麦子。”他又向大家声明：一斤换一斤。这样用公平交换的办法帮助农民选种，大家都满意。
    在选种工作结束时，全村一百二十七户中，进行了选种的共有七十八户，共选出种籽二千八百八十九斤，可以播种二百六十九亩地。在全村今年准备种麦的五百五十六亩土地中，占了百分之四十八。
    何辛庄去年是个重水灾区，农民在生产中有很多困难。今年三月，河北省立沧县农场到该村推广优良谷种“华农四号”。该村农民很欢迎这种谷种，可是没有力量换种。丁金起同志知道农民有这种困难，就将自己所剩余的一部分米借给大家去换优良谷种。一共有十余户农民向他借了八十斤米，拿去换了一百斤“华农四号”谷种，播种了将近七十亩地。由于丁金起同志的领导及帮助，该村打下了明年进一步推广优良品种的基础。
