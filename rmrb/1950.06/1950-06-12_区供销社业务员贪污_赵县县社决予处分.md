　　District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Salesman Embezzles Funds; Zhao County Cooperative Decides to Punish Him
    Yang Xiaoqiu (Communist Party member), a salesman at the Yangjiaguo District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhao County, Hebei Province, became corrupt and embezzled 500,000 yuan of public funds. On May 16th, Yang Xiaoqiu was responsible for buying black beans in Fanzhuang. At the time, the accountant, Fan Suolu, was careless and gave Yang Xiaoqiu 2.5 million yuan, mistaking it for 2 million yuan. He then embezzled the remaining funds. That night, the accountant discovered 500,000 yuan was missing when balancing the accounts and asked Xiaoqiu about it. Xiaoqiu claimed he didn't know. The next day, the accountant, Fan Suolu, went to the Fanzhuang grain stalls to investigate and obtained proof from the traders, at which point Yang Xiaoqiu could no longer deny it.
    Yang Xiaoqiu's embezzlement this time was not accidental. He had always been unorganized and undisciplined, disrespectful to his superiors, and corrupt. Last winter, when he was a salesman at the Hancun branch, he constantly engaged in affairs with women. The masses were very dissatisfied with him. Director Wang Jingmin repeatedly criticized and educated him. Not only did he not accept it, but he also colluded with assistant Sun Zhenshen (a rich peasant) and salesman Wang Shuyou to form a small clique, not do their work, and stir up trouble among comrades, causing disunity within the cooperative, making it impossible to carry out the work. Yang Xiaoqiu's hedonistic thinking was particularly serious. He was afraid of hardship and unwilling to work in the countryside, but emphasized that business cadres should not go to the countryside. Once, Director Zhang assigned him to work in the village, but Yang Xiaoqiu was unwilling to go. Despite repeated explanations, it was to no avail.
    In this introspection, Yang Xiaoqiu still concealed his mistakes. In order to enforce strict political discipline, the county cooperative has requested approval from the special district general cooperative to dismiss him from his post, recover the embezzled funds from him, and hand him over to the court for legal action. At the same time, the county party committee decided to request approval from the prefectural committee to give him a public warning as punishment.

### 区供销社业务员贪污  赵县县社决予处分

　　区供销社业务员贪污  赵县县社决予处分
    河北省赵县杨家郭区供销社业务员杨小秋（中共党员），腐化堕落，贪污公款五十万元。五月十六日，杨小秋负责到范庄买黑豆，当时会计范锁路工作马虎，把二百五十万元钱当作二百万元交给杨小秋。他就将余款贪污了。夜间会计结账时发觉少了五十万元，便问小秋。小秋却说不知道。第二天，会计范锁路便到范庄粮食摊调查，得到了交易员的证明；杨小秋才无言抵赖。
    杨小秋此次贪污，并不是偶然的。他过去一贯无组织无纪律，目无上级，腐化堕落。去年冬季，他在韩村分社任业务员时，不断地搞女人。群众对他很不满。主任王敬敏曾再三批评、教育他。他不但不接受，反而拉拢协助员孙增深（富农）、业务员王书有结成小集团，不干工作并挑拨同志关系，引起社内不团结，致使合作社工作无法进行。杨小秋的享乐思想特别严重。他怕吃苦不愿到农村工作，却强调业务干部不能下乡。有一次，张主任分配他下村去工作，杨小秋不愿去。虽经再三解释，仍无效果。
    杨小秋在这次反省中，对自己的错误仍抱隐瞒态度。县社为严明政纪，已呈请专区总社批准将他撤职，向他追回贪污款项，并把他送交法院依法处理。同时，县委决定呈请地委批准。给以当众警告处分。
