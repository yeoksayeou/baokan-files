　　Cui Shiqi of Datong Mining Bureau Printing Factory
    Embezzles Over Seven Million Public Funds; Sent to Court for Legal Punishment
    Cui Shiqi, a cadre of the Datong Mining Bureau Printing Factory, has been dismissed and investigated for embezzling public funds. Before liberation, he worked as a clerk in the pseudo-railway bureau. After liberation, relying on the seven tricycles left by his father, he exploited rickshaw pullers and engaged in brokerage (buying and selling) for profit. Later, he was introduced to the Bureau by Ru Weiduo (a retained employee) of the Mining Bureau's Beijing office and began working in January of this year, responsible for preparing for the establishment of the printing factory. In February, when he went to Beijing to purchase type-casting furnaces, copper molds, large steel plates, type cases, eight-page machines, foot-powered machines, and lead type, he embezzled approximately six million RMB. In March, when he went to Tianjin to purchase a No. 3 foot-powered machine, he embezzled another 1.5 million RMB. In total, he embezzled more than seven and a half million RMB in public funds. He embezzled more than 2.2 million RMB from the purchase of 8,200 copper molds alone (the printing equipment he purchased was all old, worth only one-third of the market price).

    After repeated urging from the leadership, Cui Shiqi reluctantly opened the factory on May 1st. After the factory opened, Cui only accepted simple miscellaneous forms and other tasks, deliberately delaying the printing of major publications such as the Miner's Daily and study documents. Cui Shiqi also suppressed democracy in the factory, preventing workers from raising opinions, which led to a decline in workers' production morale and failure to complete tasks on time.

    In late April, the Miner's Daily discovered this situation and conducted an in-depth investigation among the workers to find out the reasons for the failure to complete printing tasks. Finally, Cui Shiqi's corrupt actions were discovered.

    In his self-criticism, Cui Shiqi admitted that when purchasing machinery in Beijing, he colluded with a private merchant manager and brokers to embezzle 2.6 million RMB in public funds, and embezzled 700,000 RMB when purchasing machinery in Tianjin, totaling 3.3 million RMB. However, he was still unwilling to thoroughly admit his mistakes, attempting to deceive the leadership. The Datong Mining Bureau has decided to recover the embezzled funds from him, dismiss him from his post, and send him to the court for legal punishment.

　　大同矿务局印刷厂崔士奇
    贪污公款七百余万  已送法院依法惩办
    大同矿务局印刷厂干部崔士奇，贪污公款被撤职查办。解放前，他曾任伪铁路局职员。解放后，他依靠父亲遗留下来的七辆三轮车，一面剥削车夫，一面跑行（买卖牙纪）渔利。后经矿局驻京办事处茹维多（留用职员）介绍来局工作，于今年一月间负责筹办印刷厂工作。二月间他到北京购买铸字炉、铜模、大钢盘、字盘、八页机、足蹬机、铅字等器材时，贪污人民币六百万元左右。三月份赴天津购买三号足蹬机时，又贪污一百五十万元左右。前后两次共计贪污公款七百五十余万元。仅从购买八千二百个铜模内就贪污公款二百二十余万元（他所购买的印刷器材都是旧的，仅值市价三分之一）。
    经领导上一再催促之后，崔士奇才于五月一日将该厂勉强开了工。开工后，崔仅接受简单的零星表册等任务，对矿工报及学习文件等主要印刷品，则有意拖延不予付印。崔士奇在厂里并压制民主，不让工人提意见；因而使工人的生产情绪下降，不能按期完成任务。
    四月下旬，矿工报社发觉这种情况后，即深入工人中进行了解，追究不能完成印刷任务的原因。最后终于发现了崔士奇的贪污劣迹。
    崔士奇在反省中虽然承认在北京购买机器时，曾勾结某私商经理和跑行的合伙贪污公款人民币二百六十万元，在天津购买机器时贪污七十万元，共计贪污三百三十万元。但是，他仍旧不愿彻底认错，企图借此欺骗领导同志。现大同矿局决向他追回贪污款项，并将其撤职，送法院依法惩办。
