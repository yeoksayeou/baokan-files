[Beijing News Agency] The Beijing School Health Committee, after its establishment, has been carrying out its work step by step and with emphasis, under the principle of focusing on prevention and health education, supplemented by improving environmental hygiene and correcting defects. The committee first decided on the key tasks for this year, which are to carry out health work in municipal primary schools and kindergartens in the city, and then established school health sub-committees in various districts. The heads of the central primary schools in each district serve as the chairmen of the district sub-committees, and the physicians of the School Health Committee serve as the deputy chairmen. Each municipal primary school below the district level has a branch committee, and each branch committee organizes a student health team, which is divided into a treatment group and an environmental hygiene management group. After the establishment of organizations at all levels, the committee relied on these organizations to carry out health education, prevention and medical treatment, and improvement of environmental hygiene in various schools. In terms of health education, the main focus is on enlightening students' attention to health and cultivating good habits and attitudes. Responsible physicians from each district go to various schools to provide on-site guidance on simple corrections, morning inspections, and the handling of general infectious diseases in various ways. In terms of medical treatment, each class receives a monthly subsidy of ten catties of millet, calculated for three months (the first semester). The committee issued a total of 34,980 catties of millet in subsidies for medical equipment to 136 municipal primary schools and kindergartens (1,166 classes) in the city. Now each school has a medical kit (containing about twenty kinds of simple medicines), and the central primary schools in each district have established health rooms. In addition, the School Health Committee also issued summer emergency medicine funds to each school, totaling 8,428,000 yuan in People's currency, for the ordinary diagnosis and treatment of students in municipal primary schools. In terms of improving environmental hygiene, a survey on drinking water issues is currently underway. In the process of carrying out the work, because it is combined with the strength of school administration and has received the assistance of teachers and students, it is generally going smoothly. Teachers and students in some schools jointly organized health teams, which can take on simple correction work themselves and do it very well. For example, in the Central Primary School of the First District, the treatment group of the student health team, led by teachers, conducts daily treatment for students with defects; the students in the hygiene group of the health team check the environmental hygiene of the school every day; in terms of drinking water, the school has set up two buckets (with faucets), so that every student can drink boiled water. Before liberation, the houses in Douyacai Hutong Primary School in the Third District were dilapidated, but now the environmental hygiene has been improved; the students in the student treatment group have also learned simple correction work, and a portion of the monthly public miscellaneous expenses is allocated for hygiene expenses. The student treatment groups of Liuli Temple Primary School and Qian Yuansi Primary School in the Fifth District use their rest time to carry out correction work for their classmates. Three students are responsible for trachoma treatment, skin disease treatment, and general trauma treatment, respectively.

　　学校卫生委员会
    积极推动学校卫生工作
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市学校卫生委员会成立后，即在以预防和健康教育为主，改善环境卫生和矫治缺点为辅的方针下，有步骤、有重点地展开工作。该会首先决定了本年度的工作重点，是开展城内市立小学及幼稚园的卫生工作，随即在各区设立了学校卫生分会。各区分会以中心小学校长为主任委员，学校卫生委员会的医师为副主任委员。区以下各市立小学都设支会，各支会组织学生卫生队，卫生队分设治疗组和环境卫生管理组。各级组织建立以后，该会即依靠组织在各校进行了卫生教育、预防和医疗、改善环境卫生等项工作。在卫生教育方面，主要是启发学童对健康的注意，及养成良好的习惯和态度，并由各区负责医师到各校采取各种方式，实地指导简单矫治，晨间检查和一般传染病的处理等工作。在医疗方面，系以班为单位，每月补助小米十斤，以三个月（上学期）计算，该会对城内市立小学校和幼稚园一百三十六校（一千一百六十六班）共发出补助医疗设备费小米三万四千九百八十斤。现在各校都设立了医疗箱（简单的医药物品约二十种），各区中心小学校，设了卫生室。此外，学校卫生委员会还发给各校夏季常备药品费，计人民券八百四十二万八千元，以供各市立小学学生的普通诊治之用。在环境卫生的改善方面，现在正作饮水问题的调查。在工作进行过程中，因为结合了学校行政上的力量，并得到了教师和学生们的协助，所以一般地是很顺利的。有的学校教师和学生共同组织卫生队，对于简单的矫治工作，都能自己担负起来，并且作得很好。如第一区中心小学，由教师领导学生卫生队的治疗组，对有缺点的同学，每日都进行治疗；卫生队卫生组的同学作到每日检查校内环境卫生；在饮水方面，该校设了两个水桶（有龙头），每个学生都能喝到开水。第三区豆芽菜胡同小学，在未解放前，房舍破漏不堪，现在环境卫生已经搞得好；学生治疗组的同学也学会了简单的矫治工作，并且在每月公杂费内抽出一部分款项作为卫生用费。第五区琉璃寺小学及前圆恩寺小学学生治疗组利用休息时间给同学进行矫治缺点工作，由三个同学分别负责，一个担任砂眼治疗，一个担任皮肤病治疗，另一个担任普通外伤治疗。
