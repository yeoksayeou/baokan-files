　　Should Learn from Zhao Guilan the Spirit of Cherishing People's Property
    Shen Shu
    From the perspective of the Party as a whole, the health and lives of every Party member are part of the Party's interests. And from the perspective of an individual Party member towards the Party as a whole, that Party member's health and life are their personal interests. When a Party member sacrifices their life for the overall interests of the Party, although it is also a loss to the Party, we must never say that this Party member sacrificed the Party's interests, but only that they sacrificed their personal interests for the interests of the Party. Just as we cannot say that those who harm the Party's interests under the pretext of valuing their own health and lives are valuing the Party's interests.
    Zhao Guilan's deeds, in addition to avoiding losses of state property, more importantly, use living facts to sharply criticize the various erroneous behaviors of those who do not cherish people's property and only care about personal enjoyment.

　　应该向赵桂兰学习热爱人民财产的精神
    申抒
    从党的整体说来，每个党员的健康和生命，都是党的利益的一部分。而从党员个人对于党的整体说来，这个党员的健康和生命，就是他个人的利益。一个党员为党的整体利益而牺牲自己生命时，虽也是党的损失，但我们决不能说这个党员是牺牲了党的利益，而只能说他是为了党的利益而牺牲了个人的利益。正像对那些以重视自己的健康和生命为理由来损害党的利益的人，我们不能说他是在重视党的利益一样。
    赵桂兰的事迹，除避免国家资财损失外，更重要的是它以活的事实，尖锐地批评了那些不爱护人民财产，只关心个人享受的种种错误行为。
