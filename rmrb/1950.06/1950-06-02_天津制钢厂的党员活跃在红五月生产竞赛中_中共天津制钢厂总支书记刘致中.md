　　After preparations began for the "Red May" production competition in Tianjin, the General Party Branch Committee of the Tianjin Steel Plant, based on the general spirit of the Municipal Production Competition Committee and the production competition plan proposed by the plant's administration, formulated a work plan. On April 21st, the General Branch convened a joint meeting of branch secretaries, deciding that the central content of Party life should be the production competition, and studying how the Party could guarantee the successful completion of this production competition task. It was required that every Party member not only play a backbone and leading role in the competition movement, but also unite the masses to work hard together, and that each Party member should cultivate one or two masses to become models in the competition.

　　Under the call of the Party, before April 28th, Party members took the lead in setting out concrete personal plans for the production competition, and promoted challenge competitions in various units. When setting personal plans, Liu Guanghe, the Party member and team leader of the open-hearth furnace crane, and Chen Zuoxiang, a Party member of the open-hearth furnace, and Liu Xiaohei discussed with the workshop committee and launched the signing of master-apprentice contracts and teaching contracts in the open-hearth furnace. Liu Guanghe also guaranteed that he would teach an apprentice how to drive a crane during the competition. Under their influence, twelve pairs of masters and apprentices signed master-apprentice contracts, and three engineers and three team leaders also signed teaching contracts. At the signing ceremony of the master-apprentice contract, Chen Shunrong, the representative of the engineers, said: "We will never keep the technology secret, and we will definitely teach all we know to our fellow workers bit by bit." The apprentices also presented flags and flowers to the teachers to pay their respects, and the masters and apprentices showed great unity.

　　On May 2nd, after the plant held a mobilization meeting for the production competition, under the leadership of the Party and the administration, and with the lead of Party members and Youth League members, the workers of each branch plant and workshop devoted themselves to the competition with unparalleled production enthusiasm. After the competition started, many new records appeared in just fifteen days. That afternoon, the open-hearth furnace stopped firing for repairs. In the past, the furnace had to be dismantled the day after the fire was stopped. This time, Party members Liu Xiaohei, Sun Rongchang, and non-Party masses discussed hot dismantling the furnace. They started at twelve o'clock in the evening and finished the repairs the next morning. After the furnace repair work started, on the third day, it was found that there were problems with the slag chamber and the air chamber, and it was also found that the bottom of the furnace was too high, which would reduce the amount of steel produced. The original plan was to remove a layer from the bottom of the furnace, but the bottom of the furnace was intact and strong, and it would take too much time to remove it piece by piece. At this time, Liu Guanghe came up with a method to open a cross line on the bottom of the furnace and lift it out with a five-ton crane. In the past, it took five or six days for the rolling mill to repair a furnace, and it had to stop firing for several days before the repair could begin, waiting for it to cool down. This time, in order not to delay production and ensure the completion of the competition plan, Party member Liu Changfu (team leader), Sun Fengxi, and Youth League member Yu Baocai jointly studied and decided to try hot repairs. After the decision was made, Liu Changfu first put on asbestos clothing, stepped on wooden planks, and crawled in to repair it, regardless of the high heat. After he came out, Kong Fengxi and Yu Baocai took turns crawling in to repair it. The workers were inspired by this selfless labor enthusiasm and competed to replace them. As a result, the repair task was completed in only one and a half days.

　　During the movement, Party members also paid attention to the ideological situation of the workers, and helped backward workers to advance together and do a good job in production. At the beginning of the competition movement, temporary workers in the repair class of the maintenance section generally had ideological concerns. They were afraid that the increase in output in the competition would lead to surplus labor and cause them to lose their jobs. Because of this concern, the workers were not motivated to work. After Party member Liu Yufu discovered this, he reflected the situation to the branch on the one hand, and patiently explained to the workers on the other. It was explained that as long as everyone works hard in production, the factory can expand, and if the factory's production expands, not only will everyone not lose their jobs, but there is also hope of being promoted to long-term workers. After this ideological concern was dispelled, everyone was motivated to work. In the past, each person planed 14 pairs of track plates per day, and now they can plane 20 pairs.

　　Cao Keqin, the production team leader of the Fourth Branch, was not bold in his work in the past, and did not dare to criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of the workers. In this competition, Party member Cao Qingzao encouraged him and said, "Our Fourth Branch wants to strive for a model, we must work hard, don't worry, as long as your leadership is correct and selfless, everyone will support you." Cao Keqin not only actively led the workers to work, but also dared to make suggestions to others.

　　Wang Chunyuan, a roasting wire worker in the Second Branch, and Hou Derun, a hemp rope worker, used to like to drink and say strange things, and their work was sloppy. In this great competition movement, the workers' enthusiasm for work educated them. Their thoughts began to feel troubled, and the two of them discussed, "Others say that we don't work and like to drink, and we talk nonsense when we are drunk. We are unlucky because of this." Party member Wang Fengqi, under the instructions of the Party, took the initiative to approach them and told them sincerely, "After liberation, the factory is already our own workers, and we are sorry for the country and the people if we don't work hard. Drinking alcohol wastes money, and if you are drunk, you talk nonsense, which makes people unwilling to work with you. Why is this?" Wang Chunyuan and Hou Derun listened to Wang Fengqi several times, and saw everyone working enthusiastically and actively. They were moved and said, "Others are also people, and we are also people. Why can others work actively and we can't?" We must fight for this tone in this competition and unite well with everyone to strive to be a model!" The responsible comrades of the Party, government, and labor union continued to inspire their enthusiasm, cared about their work, and asked them if they were tired from work. They said, "This time I feel really happy to work, and I don't feel tired." Their clothes are often soaked with sweat. They are not only active but also careful and meticulous in their work. In the past, they used to throw the iron "yaozi" (a kind of fastener) that they took off from the "shangluozi" (a process) all over the ground, and often dumped them into the trash can together with the dirty soil. Now they arrange the iron "yaozi" one by one and send them to the wire drawing yard for use. This not only saves a lot of iron "yaozi," but their "shangluozi" group also automatically reduced one person to do other work.

　　天津制钢厂的党员活跃在红五月生产竞赛中  
    中共天津制钢厂总支书记  刘致中
    天津市红五月生产竞赛运动开始准备后，中共天津制钢厂总支委员会即根据市生产竞赛委员会的总精神及本厂行政方面所提出的生产竞赛运动计划，拟定了工作计划。四月二十一日总支部召开了支部书记联席会议，决定党内生活以生产竞赛为中心内容，研究了党如何保证胜利完成这次生产竞赛的任务。要求每个党员在竞赛运动中不仅个人起骨干带头作用，而且要很好的团结群众共同努力，每个党员要在竞赛中培养一两个群众成为模范。
    在党的号召下，四月二十八日以前，党员带头纷纷订出个人在生产竞赛中的具体计划，并推动各单位进行挑战竞赛。在订个人计划时，马丁炉天车领班党员刘广和，平炉党员陈作祥、刘小黑和车间委员会商量，在马丁炉发动了订师徒合同和教学合同。刘广和并保证自己在竞赛期间教会一个徒弟开天车。在他们的影响下，有十二对师徒订立了师徒合同，三个工程师、三个领班也都签订了教学合同。在师徒合同签字大会上，工程师代表陈顺荣说：“我们绝不保守技术，一定把我们所会的东西一点一滴都教给工友们。”学徒们并向老师们献旗献花致敬，师徒间表现得非常团结。
    五月二日，全厂举行生产竞赛动员大会后，在党和行政的领导和党、团员的带头下，各分厂各车间的工人便以无比的生产热忱投入竞赛运动。竞赛开始后，仅仅十五天中就出现了许多新纪录。当天下午，马丁炉停火修理。在过去必须停火后第二天才能拆炉。这次党员刘小黑、孙荣昌等和非党群众一块商量着热拆炉。他们晚上十二点动手，第二天早上就修理完毕。修炉工作开始后，第三天发现渣子房和空气房有了毛病，又发现炉底过高将使出钢数量减少。原打算将炉底起出一层，但炉底是完整而且坚固的，若一小块一小块起又太费时间。这时刘广和想了一个办法，在炉底上打开了一道十字线，用五吨的天车吊了出来。轧钢部过去修一次炉就要五、六天，在开修前还要停火好几天，等冷下来以后才能开修，这次为着不误生产，保证完成竞赛计划，党员刘长福（领班）、孙凤喜，团员于宝才共同研究，决定试行热修。决定后刘长福首先穿上石棉衣，脚下踏着木板，不顾高热烘烤，毅然爬进去修理。他出来后，接着孔凤喜和于宝才又替换着爬进去修理。工友们被这种忘我的劳动热情所激励，竞相替换着进去修理。结果，仅用一天半的时间，完成了修理的任务。
    运动中，党员还注意了工友的思想情况，和帮助落后的工人们共同前进，搞好生产。竞赛运动开始之初，保全股修理班的临时工人普遍存在着思想顾虑。他们怕竞赛中产量增加，劳动力过剩而使自己失业。由于这种顾虑的存在，工人们干起活来就不起劲。经党员刘玉福发现后，一面把这种情况反映到支部，一面耐心向工友们进行解释。说明只要大家努力生产，工厂才能扩大，工厂生产扩大了，不但大家不会失业，并有提升为长工的希望。这种思想顾虑打消后，大家干活都起劲了。过去每人每天刨道板十四对，现在能刨二十对了。
    四分厂生产班长曹克勤过去工作不大胆，对工人的缺点和错误也不敢批评。在这次竞赛中，党员曹清澡鼓励他说：“我们四分厂要争取模范，我们一定要努力干，你不要担心，只要你领导正确，大公无私，大家都会拥护你。”曹克勤不但积极起来领导工人干活，对别人也敢提意见了。
    二分厂烤线工人王春远，麻绳工人侯德润两人过去爱喝酒，爱说怪话，工作上吊儿郎当。在这个大竞赛运动中，工友们的工作热情教育了他们。他们的思想开始感到苦恼，两个人谈论着：“别人都说咱不干活，好喝酒，喝醉了就胡说。咱们倒霉就倒在这上边了。”党员王凤起在党的指示下，主动地和他们接近，诚恳地告诉他们说：“解放后工厂已经是咱们工人自己的了，不好好干活就对不起国家人民。喝酒浪费金钱，喝醉了又信口乱说，招得人家都不愿意和你们一起工作，这是为啥呢？”王春远、侯德润听了王凤起和他们谈过几次话，又看到大家热情积极工作，他们感动地说：“人家也是人，咱们也是人，为什么人家能积极的干，咱们不能呢？”咱们非在这次竞赛中争这口气不可，和大家好好的团结在一起，争取作个模范！”党、政、工负责同志又不断启发他们的积极性，关心他们的工作，问他们干活累不累，他们说：“这次干活觉得真痛快，不觉得累了。”他们的衣服经常是被汗湿透的。他们不只积极而且工作仔细认真。过去他们“上洛子”把解下来的铁“要子”弄得满地都是，常和脏土一块倒到垃圾箱去，现在把铁“要子”一根根整理好再送到拔丝场去用。这样不但节省了不少的铁“要子”，并且他们这“上洛子”组还自动减下一个人去干别的活。
