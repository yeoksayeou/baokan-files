　　Tangshan Competition Deepens
    Workers Determined to Greet "July 1st" with Production Victories

    [This newspaper's dispatch] Tangshan Labor Daily message: The Tangshan Red May Production Increase and Thrift Practice Model Competition, under the correct leadership of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and through the active efforts of more than 150,000 organized workers and working people, has achieved significant results. The movement has now entered its climax. All city workers are now greeting the great "July 1st" and the new tasks of the third quarter with full energy.

    During the month-long competition, all factories and mines in Tangshan completed or exceeded their May production targets. More than a thousand creations, inventions, and new production records emerged. The railway factory completed half a year's production task in five months, saving the state wealth of more than 20 million catties of millet. The Tangshan Electric Power Bureau completed half a year's electricity sales task in five months, increasing revenue by approximately six million catties of millet, and set a new record for the average monthly coal consumption of 0.577 kilograms. After the Kailuan Coal Mine launched a competition in the second half of May, it produced 280,000 tons of coal in half a month (compared to a monthly production of 360,000 tons). Even with an excess of 100,000 tons, the increased production value is over 14 million catties of millet. Other factories, such as the steel mill, Huaxin Textile Factory, Qixin Porcelain Factory, and Qixin Cement Factory, have made remarkable achievements in increasing output and improving quality.

    In terms of improving production organization and management systems, many advanced examples have also emerged in Tangshan factories. A responsibility system has been generally established in state-owned factories, basically eliminating the phenomenon of no one being responsible. The Tangshan Electric Power Bureau implemented a comprehensive safety responsibility system, the railway factory implemented an advanced production chart system, and the telecommunications bureau implemented a "three-package" system (packaging the machine, packaging the platform, and packaging the repair). To overcome the disconnection in the production process, all employees of the Electric Power Bureau signed a collective contract with the administration, clarifying the relationship between public and private interests. The Kailuan Mining Bureau, which has 50,000 employees, has initially reformed the corrupt bureaucratic structure, expelled some special agents and corrupt elements hated by the workers, and established a labor-management consultation meeting. In terms of technical learning, steel mills, electric power bureaus, railway factories, and Qixin Cement Factory have strengthened technical learning through forms such as master-apprentice contracts, technical seminars, and technical training courses. In addition, from the administration of each unit, each department to each individual, the method of formulating production plans and work plans has been generally implemented, making production and work have specific purposes and directions, and initially overcoming the blindness in production and work.

    Among the 120 private medium and small factories in Tangshan, 63 have participated in the production competition. Due to the active production of workers, output has increased significantly, quality has gradually improved, and the rate of damage and rework has been relatively reduced. To overcome the current production difficulties of private factories, some workers voluntarily reduced their wages by 20%, and some voluntarily increased their working hours by one hour. Under the active influence of the workers, some capitalists began to change their attitudes and actively managed their businesses; some voluntarily reduced their living expenses and saved expenditures; some actively tried to open up sales channels, thus making labor-capital relations in Tangshan move towards normal. The above facts prove that it is not only possible to launch a production competition in private factories, but it is also necessary. Only by increasing production and reducing costs can the policy of benefiting both labor and capital be better realized.

    The production competition movement is continuing to develop (ending on June 25). Workers are determined to greet the new tasks of the third quarter and the "July 1st" Party's birthday with greater victories.

　　唐山竞赛深入开展
    职工决以生产胜利迎接“七一”
    【本报讯】唐山劳动日报消息：唐山红五月生产节约创模竞赛运动，在中共唐山市委的正确领导下，经过十五万以上有组织的工人和劳动人民的积极努力，已获得重大收获，现在运动已进入高潮。全市职工正以饱满的精力，迎接伟大“七一”的到来，迎接第三季度的新任务。
    在一个月的竞赛中，唐山全部厂矿都完成或超过了五月份的生产任务。创造、发明及生产新纪录共出现一千多件。铁路工厂在五个月内完成了半年生产任务，节省了国家财富二千多万斤小米。唐山电业局以五个月时间完成了半年售电任务，增加收入约达六百万斤米，并创全月平均煤耗○点五七七公斤的新纪录。开滦煤矿在五月下半月开展竞赛运动后，半个月产煤二十八万吨（过去月产三十六万吨），即以超额十万吨计算，其增产价值也在一千四百万斤小米以上。其他如制钢厂、华新纺织厂、启新磁厂、启新洋灰工厂等在增加产量，提高质量方面都有惊人的成绩。
    在改进生产组织与管理制度方面，唐山各厂也出现了许多先进的范例。各国营工厂中普遍建立了负责制，基本上消灭了无人负责现象。唐山电业局实行了全面安全负责制，铁路工厂实行了先进的生产图表制，电信局实行了“三包”制（包机、包台、包修制）。为克服生产过程中的脱节现象，电业局全体职工与行政上签订了集体合同，明确了公私关系。拥有五万职工的开滦矿务局，初步改革了腐朽的官僚机构，开除了一部分为工人群众所痛恨的特务、贪污的坏分子，成立了劳资协商会议。在技术学习方面，制钢厂、电业局、铁路工厂以及启新洋灰工厂等，通过师徒合同、技术座谈会、技术训练班等形式，加强了技术学习。另外，从各单位行政上，各部门到各个人，普遍实行了制订生产计划、工作计划的方法，使生产和工作有了具体的目的和方向，初步克服了生产和工作中的盲目性。
    唐市一百二十户私营中、小工厂中，有六十三户已投入生产竞赛运动，由于工人的积极生产，产量显著增加，质量亦渐提高，破损率和反手活则相对减低了。为克服私营工厂目前生产中的困难，有的工人自动减低工资百分之二十，有的自动增加工作一小时。在工人的积极影响下，有些资方开始转变了态度，积极经营起来；有的自动减低生活费用，节省开支；有的积极到外面设法打开销路，因而使唐市劳资关系走向正常。从以上事实证明：在私营工厂中不仅可以发动生产竞赛，而且也是必须的。只有提高了生产，减低了成本，才能更好的实现劳资两利的方针。
    现在生产竞赛运动正继续开展（至六月二十五日结束）。职工决心以更大的胜利来迎接第三季度的新任务，来迎接“七一”党的生日。
