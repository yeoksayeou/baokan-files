　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 14th: TASS, Moscow, June 12th: Pravda recently published an editorial entitled "The Supreme Soviet of the Socialist State," stating: Never in human history has there been a more perfect form of socialist democracy that truly belongs to the people. Soviet democracy is strong because it possesses a strong and all-encompassing popular character, because the Soviets have a close, flesh-and-blood connection with the hundreds of millions of working people, and because the masses themselves are displaying creativity and initiative. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union relies on the complete and undivided trust of the entire Soviet people. For all people who have embarked on the road of building socialism, Soviet democracy is an inspiring example.
    The editorial concluded: The Soviet Union consistently strives to coexist peacefully with all countries and struggles for peace and against warmongers. The Soviet government will thwart the imperialist bloc's conspiracies to undermine the United Nations through its unwavering policy of peace.

　　真理报社论指出
    苏联民主是坚强的，它具有浓厚的、无所不包的人民性。
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：真理报顷以《社会主义国家的最高苏维埃》为题发表社论称：人类历史从来没有更加完善的、真正属于人民的社会主义民主形式。苏维埃民主是坚强的，因为它具有浓厚的、无所不包的人民性。因为苏维埃和亿万劳动人民有血肉的联系，因为群众自己发挥着创造性和积极性。苏联最高苏维埃依靠着全体苏联人民完全的、专一的信任，对一切已经开始走上建设社会主义道路的人民来说，苏维埃民主是具有鼓舞力量的范例。
    社论末称：苏联始终如一地力求与一切国家和平共处，并为争取和平、反对战争贩子而斗争。苏联政府将以坚定不移的和平政策，挫败帝国主义集团图谋暗中破坏联合国的奸计。
