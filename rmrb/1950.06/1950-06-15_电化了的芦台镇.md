　　Electrified Lutai Town
    Ye Tao
    When the train on the Beining Railway is about to arrive at Lutai Station, you can see an endless expanse of green fields flashing quickly before your eyes. Countless ditches draw the inexhaustible water source from the Ji Canal, spreading it to every rice field, making you feel a new force of life rising and leaping forward in the new Chinese countryside!
    The water of the Ji Canal flows endlessly all year round. Farmers on both sides of the river dig ditches and erect dragon-bone waterwheels to draw water into the rice fields. During the period of Japanese occupation and the Kuomintang era, farmers used this old method. However, because the land here is close to the sea, most of the soil contains too much salt, and it must be washed with water before it can be irrigated. How much effort it takes to wash and irrigate the fields with manpower! Therefore, the Bohai District Agricultural Reclamation Bureau established an electrified water conservancy station here, using electricity from the Tangshan Power Plant to pump water to wash and irrigate the fields, assisting farmers in production.
    In addition to the Gaoli District State-owned Farm, Lutai also has seven joint-venture farms. Since the establishment of the electrified water conservancy station, the seven joint-venture farms have been converted into seven electrified water conservancy areas. The government and farmers cooperate in the form of mutual assistance labor to operate them.
    When the electrified water conservancy station was first established, the biggest difficulty encountered was the work of surveying land. Here, in each electrified water conservancy area, the land of villages and households is intertwined. Therefore, in addition to the main and branch drainage lines, most of the other small drainage ditches flow into the fields according to the natural terrain of the land. This makes it difficult to implement the principles of saving water and electricity, reducing the burden on farmers, and carrying out organized democratic management, and it is impossible to investigate who saves and who wastes water among farmers. Therefore, after concrete research by the station, a method of mobilizing the masses to survey the land was devised. The management committees of the established electrified water conservancy areas were temporarily changed to land surveying committees, and several experienced old farmers were selected from each village to participate in the surveying. Before the surveying, the masses were generally explained and publicized: "The land surveying is not only for the public, but to measure the accurate acreage for all farmers, so that everyone's water conservancy fees and agricultural loans are fair and reasonable." This eliminated the vague views of the farmers, clarified the land surveying and division of each water conservancy area, and produced detailed maps of the natural basic situation of the land in each electrified water conservancy area, preparing for the adjustment of land this autumn and next spring to achieve the basic conditions for rational zoning and organizational cooperation.
    After the surveying was completed, the huge project of opening the main and branch water lines, small ditches, drainage main lines, and constructing the pumping stations (pump stations) in each electrified water conservancy area began. Under the leadership of the station and government cadres, the farmers in each area actively participated in the work of opening canals and ditches. In the face of strong winds, heavy rain, and scorching sun, they acted quickly and completed it in a very short period.
    The construction of the pumping station is an arduous task, especially the Dongzhuangzi pumping station, which was severely damaged when the Japanese surrendered and retreated. According to local farmers, it was damaged from top to bottom (that is, from the machine to the ground), and after the Kuomintang came, it was damaged from bottom to top (digging up the ground to find machine parts and destroying the roof). However, with the strong help of the Water Conservancy and Irrigation Project Office and the assistance of the local government, it has now been fully built and has begun trial operation.
    When the electric rollers of each electrified water conservancy area were running and the water pumps were roaring, the water poured down from the Ji Canal like a waterfall, and then branched into the main water lines and extended to the distance. The nearby farmers, old men, old women, elder brothers, elder sisters-in-law... surrounded the pumping station, watching the water flow, all casting surprised eyes. Old man Wang of the Huanggu Village Water Conservancy Area said: "This is repaired, it is really 'ten thousand years of stability'." Old man Zhang said: "This is built, even our children and grandchildren will enjoy the benefits, let's call it children and grandchildren!"

　　电化了的芦台镇
    叶淘
    当北宁路的火车，快行抵芦台站时，可以看到一望无际的绿野，从你的眼前飞快地闪过，无数条沟渠从蓟运河引来滔滔不绝的水源，散布到每块稻田，使你感到新中国农村一种新生的力量在上升、跃进！
    蓟运河的水，长年不息的奔流着，两岸的农民，开沟引渠，搭起龙骨水车往稻田里打水，日寇侵占时代，国民党时代农民都是用这个老法子。但是这里的土地因靠海近，土壤大多含盐量过多，必须先用水冲洗过一遍，才能灌田，用人力打水冲洗灌田是多么费事！因此渤海区农垦局便在此建立了电化水利站，由唐山发电厂送过电来利用电力抽水冲田灌田，扶助农民生产。
    芦台除了高里区国营农场外，还有七个合营农场自电化水利站成立后，七个合营农场，便改建为七个电化水利区。由政府与农民合作，以互助劳动形式来经营。
    在电化水利站初成立时，遭遇到最大的困难便是清丈土地的工作。这里，每一电化水利区，村与村户与户的土地交叉，因此除用排水干线、支线外，其他排水小沟大部都是随着土地自然形势而流入田地，如此对实行节水节电减轻农民的负担原则，和进行组织起来民主管理，就有些困难，对农民用水上谁省谁费就无法考查。因此，经过了该站具体研究后，想出了发动群众清丈土地的办法，将已成立的各电化水利区管理委员会临时改为清丈委员会，各村选出对丈量有经验的老农数人参加丈量。并在丈量前向群众普遍讲解宣传：“丈量土地不是专给公家丈量，而是为全体农户量出准确亩数，使大家水利费及农贷公平合理”。消除了农民们模糊的观点，将各水利区土地丈量划分清楚，并制出详细的各电化水利区的土地自然基本形势图，准备今秋明春调整土地，以达到合理区划和组织合作的基本条件。
    在丈量完毕后，便是开用水干线，支线、小沟、排水干线及建造各电化水利区的扬水场（水泵场）的巨大工程。在该站及政府干部带头下，各区的农民踊跃参加开渠开沟的工作，在大风大雨和烈日照射下，他们以迅速的动作行动着，终于在很短期间完成。
    建造扬水场是件艰巨的工作，尤其是董庄子扬水场在日本投降撤退时，破坏很严重。据当地农民说：从上头破坏到下头（即从机器破坏到地），而国民党来了后，却又由下头破坏到上头（把地扒开找机件，又把房盖也破坏）。但在水利灌溉工程处大力帮助及当地政府协助下，到目前已全部建好，并且已开始了试车。
    当每个电化水利区的电滚子开动着，水泵轰轰作响时，大水就像瀑布般从蓟运河倾倒下来，而分向各干水线再转向各支线伸向远方，附近的农民、老大爷、老大娘、大哥、大嫂……围着扬水场，看着水流，都投射着惊奇的眼光。皇姑庄水利区王老大爷说：“这个修好了，真是‘万年牢’。”张老大爷说：“这个建好，连咱们子子孙孙都享受到好处，咱们就叫它子子孙孙吧！”
