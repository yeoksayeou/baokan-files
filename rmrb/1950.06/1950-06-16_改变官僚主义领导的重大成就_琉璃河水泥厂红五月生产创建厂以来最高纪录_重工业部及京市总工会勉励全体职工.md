　　Major Achievement in Changing Bureaucratic Leadership
    Liulihe Cement Plant's "Red May" Production Sets Highest Record Since Factory's Founding
    Ministry of Heavy Industry and Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Encourage All Employees
    [Our Newspaper] The state-owned Liulihe Cement Plant exceeded its plan in May by producing 10,414.6 tons of cement and 9,968 tons of clinker, setting a new record since the factory was founded in 1944. The cost of cement per ton also decreased by 5.4% compared to April of this year. All employees were elated and jointly wrote to Minister and Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, Li Fuchun and He Changgong, and Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Peng Zhen, reporting this great news. Minister Li, Vice Minister He, and Chairman Peng Zhen all replied with letters encouraging the factory's employees.
    Since its official resumption of work in April of last year, the factory had twice completed its 10,000-ton cement plan ahead of schedule by the end of the year. However, this year, due to poor unity between the factory director and deputy director, poor unity among employees, the administrative leadership's lack of firm grasp on the viewpoint of relying on workers, and a lack of various production management systems, the workers' labor discipline became lax, and saboteurs took the opportunity to cause trouble, leading to continuous machine failures that seriously affected production. The North China Ceramics Company's leadership of the factory at that time was also impractical and failed to overcome various shortcomings in a timely manner, resulting in the failure to complete the production plans for January, February, and March of this year. In mid-March, the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ceramics Company successively sent inspection teams and working groups to the factory to help improve the company's leadership methods, strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses and between superiors and subordinates, promote the overall unity of the factory, and solve some technical problems with the workers. As a result, the production situation improved in April, with clinker exceeding the plan by 8% and cement exceeding by 4.5%. At the end of April, the factory's CCP branch determined that the central task of the branch in May was to overfulfill the production plan, and Party members should unite with the masses and work together. When the branch general meeting and various branch meetings discussed production, they invited the factory director and section chiefs to attend. Party members were specifically assigned to implement the branch's resolutions in various production units. At the same time, due to the unity of the employees, the entire production plan for May was seriously discussed, and each workshop formulated its own specific plan based on this plan; the trade union also launched a "Red May" flag competition, so the workers' morale was high, and labor productivity significantly improved. When machines broke down, workers immediately rushed to repair them. Communist Party member Li Bingge worked overtime for two consecutive nights to repair No. 1 rotary kiln. Some workers worked continuously for more than ten hours at a time to repair No. 2 cement mill. The number of kiln shutdowns by the fire-watching shift was reduced from an average of 8.3 times per shift (the second half of March) to 6.15 times, and the coal mill room did not affect kiln opening due to failures throughout the month. Workers improved their skills in batching, grinding, and firing, and strengthened the maintenance and repair of machines. In addition, No. 1 cement mill, which had been shut down for more than three months, was repaired on May 2, resulting in a large increase in output. Cement output exceeded the plan by 28.5%. Clinker exceeded by 18%, and the hourly output of the cement mill increased from 7.8 tons in April to 9.4 tons. The direct power consumption per ton of cement also decreased from 113.96 kWh in April to 110.11 kWh. This alone saved 40,096 kWh of electricity throughout the month. The highest record of clinker monthly output during the Japanese puppet period was 5,400 tons, and the highest record of cement was 7,600 tons. After liberation, the highest monthly output of clinker was 9,183 tons, and the highest cement was 6,934 tons. This time, the monthly output of clinker reached 9,968 tons, and cement reached 10,414.6 tons.
    Now the factory's output is gradually increasing. On June 5, the hourly output of the cement mill had reached 11.1 tons, and on the 6th, it further increased to 11.2 tons. The value of this achievement is not only because of the high quantity and good quality (during the Japanese Hua Bei Yang Hui Co., Ltd. management period, the factory's product's 7-day expansion and compressive strength were: 21.9 and 293 (kg per square centimeter); during the Kuomintang reactionary rule: 25.7 and 394; after liberation, it has been maintained at a level of 27.2 and 435, exceeding the common German standard), but also because these main machines are old equipment beyond their insurance period. No. 1 rotary kiln was only operated for seven days and then broke down during the Japanese occupation, and the Kuomintang did not dare to repair it at all. Last year, the workers repaired it to welcome "July 1st," and now they are preparing to operate all four rotary kilns simultaneously for fifteen consecutive days in June, something that the Japanese puppets did not even dare to think about.
    For the sake of regularizing production, the factory has established a production management system and is discussing operating procedures and machine maintenance methods, etc. (Lu Niangao)
    [Our Newspaper] Minister of Heavy Industry Li Fuchun, Vice Ministers He Changgong, Zhong Lin, and Liu Ding, and Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Peng Zhen, respectively replied to all employees of the Liulihe Cement Plant, congratulating them on their significant achievements in production. The joint letter from the Minister and Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Heavy Industry pointed out that the anti-bureaucratic criticism and self-criticism between the leaders of the North China Ceramics Company and the Liulihe Cement Plant, the strengthening of unity among all employees around the CCP branch and the trade union, the rectification of labor discipline, the development of study, and the mobilization of the creativity and enthusiasm of all employees are the key to the cement plant's significant achievements. Chairman Peng Zhen of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions said in his letter: "Your factory has old machines and a large task, but you have changed this situation with the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, thus making the old machines younger, the broken machines better, and the output increased. This is a great thing that is beneficial to the people." Both letters encouraged all employees of the factory to consolidate their existing achievements, continue to overcome difficulties, and strive to create newer and higher records.

　　改变官僚主义领导的重大成就
    琉璃河水泥厂红五月生产创建厂以来最高纪录
    重工业部及京市总工会勉励全体职工
    【本报讯】国营琉璃河水泥厂，五月份超计划地生产了水泥一万零四百一十四点六吨及熟料九千九百六十八吨，创造了自一九四四年建厂以来的最高新纪录。水泥成本每吨也比今年四月份减少了百分之五点四，全体职工兴高采烈地联名上书重工业部正副部长李富春、何长工等和北京市总工会彭真主席，报告这个大喜讯。李部长、何副部长及彭真主席，均复信鼓励该厂职工。
    该厂自去年四月正式复工以来，到去年年底，曾两次提前完成万吨水泥计划。但是到了今年，由于正副厂长团结不好，职工团结不好，行政的领导上对于依靠工人的观点掌握的不紧，又缺乏各种生产管理制度，所以工人的劳动纪律松弛，破坏分子乘机捣鬼，机器连续发生故障，严重的影响了生产。华北窑业公司当时对该厂的领导也不切实际，没有及时克服各种缺点，致该厂今年一、二、三三个月的生产计划，都没有完成。三月中，重工业部和窑业公司，先后派了检查组和工作组到该厂帮助，改善了公司对该厂的领导方法，从加强党群关系和上下级的关系，推动了全厂的大团结，并且和工人一起解决了技术上的一些问题。因此，四月份生产情况好转，熟料超过计划百分之八，水泥超过百分之四点五。四月底，该厂中共支部，确定五月份的支部中心工作是超额完成生产计划，党员要结合群众，共同努力。支部大会和各分支会议讨论生产时，曾分别邀请厂长和股长等列席参加。党员们具体分工，负责在各生产单位中执行支部的决议。同时，又因职工团结，认真讨论过五月份的整个生产计划，各车间都根据这个计划订立了自己的具体计划；工会又发起了红五月争红旗竞赛，所以工人情绪高涨，劳动生产率显著的提高。机器出了毛病，工人马上抢修。共产党员李秉革，为了抢修一号旋窑，曾接连加班两夜。部分工人一次曾连续工作十小时以上，抢修了二号水泥磨。看火班的停窑次数由每班平均八点三次（三月下半月）减到六点一五次，煤磨室全月没有因故障而影响开窑。工人提高了配料、磨料、烧窑的技术，加强了机器的保养修理，加上五月二日修好了停开三个多月的一号水泥磨，因此，产量大增。水泥出品额超过计划的百分之二八点五。熟料超过百分之十八，水泥磨每小时的产量，从四月份的七点八吨提高到九点四吨。每吨水泥的直接用电量，也从四月份的一百一十三点九六度减少到一百一十点一一度。只此一项，全月即节电四万零九十六度。日伪时期熟料月产量的最高纪录是五千四百吨，水泥的最高纪录是七千六百吨。解放后，熟料月产量最高到过九千一百八十三吨，水泥最高到过六千九百三十四吨。而这次熟料月产量达到了九千九百六十八吨，水泥达到了一万零四百十四点六吨。
    现在该厂的产量，还在逐渐提高。六月五日，水泥磨的每小时产量已达到了十一点一吨，六日更提高到十一点二吨。这种成绩的难能可贵，并不只是因为数量高而且质量好（日寇华北洋灰株式会社管理时期，该厂产品七天的扩张强度和耐压强度是：二一点九和二九三（每平方公分公斤数）；国民党反动统治时期是：二五点七和三九四；解放后一直维持二七点二和四三五的水准，超过通用的德国标准），而且是因为这些主要机器，都是超过保险期的老家伙。一号旋窑在日寇时期只开过七天就坏了，国民党时期根本没敢修理。去年工人为了迎接“七一”，把它修好了，现在更准备在六月里四个旋窑同时开，连开十五天，这是日伪时期连想都不敢想的事情。
    为了生产正规化，该厂已确定了生产管理制度，正在讨论操作规程和机器保养办法等。（卢念高）
    【本报讯】重工业部部长李富春、副部长何长工、钟林、刘鼎，北京市总工会主席彭真，分别复函琉璃河水泥厂全体职工，祝贺他们在生产上的重大成就。重工业部正副部长的联名信中指明：华北窑业公司和琉璃河水泥厂领导之间进行了反官僚主义的批评与自我批评，全体职工在中共支部及工会周围加强了团结，整顿劳动纪律，开展了学习，发动了全体职工的创造性，积极性，是水泥厂造成重大成绩的关键。北京市总工会彭真主席在信中说：“你们厂子里机器老，任务大，但是你们用工人阶级的积极性和创造性，改变了这种情况，因此，使老机器年轻了，破机器变好了，产量提高了，这是一件对人民有益的大事情。”两信中都鼓励该厂全体职工，巩固现有成绩，继续克服困难，为创造更新的新纪录而努力。
