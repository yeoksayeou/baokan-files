Xinhua News Agency, 21st — Speech by Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 21st in full:

　　Chairman, fellow members, comrades:

　　First, on behalf of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, I express my unreserved support for the points raised by Chairman Mao in his opening speech and the reports presented by the responsible comrades regarding conference affairs, political, military, diplomatic, united front work, land reform work, economic and financial work, tax work, cultural and educational work, and court work, all in accordance with the Common Program. I am willing to mobilize all our strength to strive for the thorough realization of the tasks outlined in these reports.

　　Secondly: Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, in less than eight months, the situation in the new China has truly been unprecedented in Chinese history. Now the war on the mainland has basically ended, and the liberation of Tibet and Taiwan is not far off. In the blink of an eye, all fraternal ethnic groups are living in harmony, love each other, and are united together, sitting in the same hall, creating a situation never seen before; the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is beyond doubt. The revolutionary unity of all democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations across the country is expanding and consolidating politically and organizationally, and the prestige of the Central People's Government is increasing among the broad masses of the people. This is undoubtedly due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. I represent our association in expressing our sincere respect and gratitude.

　　What I want to say further: First, Chairman Mao instructed us: to lean to the Soviet Union wholeheartedly, and immediately signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union, and many agreements beneficial to the construction of the new China, and also established brotherly friendships with the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. Therefore, our country is not only not isolated, but our country has become a backbone force in the camp defending world peace, consolidating and expanding the forces defending world peace, and playing a significant role internationally, making imperialism tremble. This is a major event concerning both domestic and international affairs, worthy of our pride. I want to request compatriots across the country to actively participate in this struggle to defend world peace.

　　Secondly: Our People's Government, with the support of the broad masses of the people, has achieved unified management and unified leadership of finance and economy in the past six months, with revenue and expenditure approaching balance, prices tending to stabilize, and famine basically overcome. Although the wounds of war have not yet healed, as long as there are no unexpected disasters, and as long as we strive towards the goals pointed out by Chairman Mao: (1) the completion of land reform, (2) the rational adjustment of industry and commerce, and (3) a large reduction in the expenses required by state institutions, the financial and economic situation will inevitably fundamentally improve. I want to request some anxious people in the country to relax their minds and strive to achieve a fundamental improvement in the national financial and economic situation.

　　Thirdly, and more importantly: Land reform: The center of our revolution's three enemies is feudalism. Land reform is digging up the roots of the feudal system, causing imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism to lose their reliance. This is a major event that our revolutionary regime will never relax. Land reform is not only beneficial to the broad masses of peasants, but it is also to lay the foundation of our country, so that our country can transition from new democracy to socialism, so that the broad masses of the four classes of our country and their descendants will benefit from it. Land reform is a crucial link in liberating rural productive forces, developing rural production, and leading China to industrialization. Without implementing land reform and thoroughly abolishing the feudal land system, there is no possibility of changing China's backwardness and poverty, industry cannot develop, and the living standards of the people across the country cannot be improved. Therefore, implementing comprehensive land reform is the most important task of our government at present. According to the new Land Law, future land reform will be carried out in a step-by-step and orderly manner. In order to facilitate the early restoration of rural production, to isolate the landlords, and protect the middle peasants and small land lessors, it is allowed to not touch the land property of the rich peasants, and preserve the rich peasant economy. As for the landlords, they can also be allocated a piece of land, and their floating wealth and the industry and commerce they operate are not touched, so that they can invest these assets into production. Such a policy of guaranteeing the greatest interests of the greatest number of people, we believe, is what everyone who wants the national economy to achieve fundamental improvement and China to truly embark on the road to prosperity and strength is happy to support. But we must also call on compatriots across the country to work together to complete this historic task. I particularly represent our association in expressing our sincere and joyful support for land reform.

　　Finally, we believe that these documents passed by the conference are plans with major historical significance related to the future of the new China. The guidelines, policies, and methods it points out are fully in line with the spirit of the Common Program, fully meet the needs and interests of the current Chinese social economy and the vast majority of people across the country, and are the basic measures that must be taken to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and carry out new democratic construction. Thoroughly implementing these policies, methods, and decrees is not only the responsibility of the People's Government, but also the responsibility and obligation of every patriotic person.

　　I would like to solemnly assure the conference on behalf of all members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy: On the one hand, all members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy must deeply study and grasp the spirit of these documents, and at the same time, we must redouble our efforts to unite and strive for everyone connected with us, and conduct in-depth propaganda, explanation, and education for them, so that they can be with us, mobilize all possible forces, and strive to ensure the full and thorough implementation of the historical tasks outlined in these reports.

### 中国民主促进会主席  马叙伦的发言

　　中国民主促进会主席
    马叙伦的发言
    【新华社二十一日讯】中国民主促进会主席马叙伦二十一日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言全文如下：主席，各位委员，各位同志：
    首先，我代表中国民主促进会对于毛主席在开会辞中所提出的各点以及各位负责同志所提出的有关会务工作，政治，军事，外交，统一战线工作，土地改革工作，经济和财政工作，税收工作，文化教育工作，法院工作等项符合于共同纲领的报告表示无保留的拥护，并愿动员我们全部的力量为这些报告所提出的任务之彻底实现而奋斗。
    其次：从中央人民政府成立以来，不到八个月的时间，新中国的情况，实在已为中国历史的破天荒。现在战争在大陆上已基本结束，西藏和台湾的解放已为期不远，转眼之间各兄弟民族都和睦亲爱团结一起，共坐一堂，开从来未有之局；蒋介石匪帮的灭亡，已毫无疑问。全国各民主阶级，各民主党派，各人民团体的革命大团结在政治上和组织上是日益扩大和巩固，中央人民政府的威信，在广大人民中是日益提高。这无疑的是由于毛主席和中国共产党正确领导所获得的，我代表我们的会致衷诚的敬意和感谢。
    我要再说的：第一是：毛主席指示我们：要向苏联一边倒，并且立刻和苏联缔结了中苏友好同盟互助条约，和许多有利于建设新中国的协定，并且和东欧新民主国家也都结了兄弟之好，因此，我们国家不但不是孤立的而且我们国家已为保卫世界和平阵营的一个中坚分子，巩固和扩大了保卫世界和平的力量，在国际上起了很大作用，使帝国主义为之发抖。这是关系国内外的一件大事，值得我们骄傲的。我要请求全国同胞踊跃来参加这个为保卫世界和平的斗争。
    第二呢：我们人民政府在广大人民的拥护和支持下，半年多来已作到财政经济的统一管理和统一领导，收支接近平衡，物价趋向稳定，灾荒亦已基本克服，虽然战事的创伤还未平复，只要没有意外灾难，只要我们向毛主席所指出的（一）土地改革的完成（二）工商业的合理调整（三）国家机构所需的经费大量节减去努力，财政经济的状况，必得基本好转。我要请求国内有些鳃鳃过虑的人们放宽心地，并向为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而奋斗。
    第三更重要的是：土地改革：我们革命的三个敌人，中心是封建主义，土改是挖封建制度的根子，使帝国主义和官僚资本主义失去了依靠，这是我们革命政权决不放松的一件大事。土改不单是对广大农民有利，而是要奠定我们国家的基础，使我们国家从新民主主义而进入社会主义，使我们全国四个阶级的广大人民和他的世世子孙都得其利。土改是解放农村生产力，发展农村生产，使中国走向工业化的决定的一环，不实行土地改革，彻底废除封建的土地制度，就没有可能改变中国落后与穷困，工业也无从发展，全国人民生活水平也就无法提高，所以实行全面的土地改革是我们政府当前最重要的任务。照新土地法规定，今后的土地改革将是有步骤有秩序地进行。为了利于早日恢复农村生产，利于孤立地主，保护中农与小土地出租者，所以允许不动富农的土地财产，保存富农经济。对于地主，他们也可分得一份土地，而且不动其浮财和他们所经营的工商业，使他们可以把这些财产投入生产。这样一个保证最大多数人的最大利益的政策，我们相信是每一个愿意国家经济达到基本好转，使中国真正走上富强大道的人所乐意拥护的。但我们也必须号召全国同胞来共同努力完成这个历史任务。我特别代表我们的会表示对土地改革的衷诚和欢跃的拥护。
    最后，我们认为大会所通过的这些文件是关系新中国前途的，有重大历史意义的方案，它所指出的方针，政策与办法完全符合于共同纲领的精神，完全切合当前中国社会经济和全国最大多数人民的需要和利益，是巩固人民民主专政和进行新民主主义建设所必须采取的基本措施。彻底实施这些政策办法和法令，不但是人民政府的职责，而且也是每一个爱国人民的责任与义务。
    我愿代表中国民主促进会全体会员向大会郑重保证：中国民主促进会全体会员一方面自己要深切地学习并掌握这些文件中的精神，同时，我们更要加倍努力地去团结争取一切与我们有联系的人，向他们进行深入的宣传与解释教育，使他们能够和我们在一起，动员一切可能动员的力量，为保证这些报告所提出的历史任务的全部彻底实行而奋斗。
