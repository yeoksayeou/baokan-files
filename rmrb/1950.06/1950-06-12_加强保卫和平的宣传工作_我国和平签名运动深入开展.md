Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The signature campaign for the defense of world peace is underway across the country, progressing alongside strengthened propaganda efforts. After the Chinese Peace Preservation Propaganda Group assisted Hangzhou in carrying out propaganda work for three days, the people of the city have gained a deeper understanding of the significance of defending world peace, and the signature campaign is now being carried out on an even larger scale. As of the 7th, more than 200,700 people in Hangzhou have signed. The Zhejiang Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace was established on the 7th and is leading the people of the province to continue this campaign.
    People from all walks of life in the cities of Southern Jiangsu are enthusiastically participating in the signature campaign. Patients in Suzhou public hospitals are signing in person, refusing to let others sign on their behalf. In Changzhou, citizens continue to flock to signature stations even in the rain. In Wuhu City, Southern Anhui, as of the 6th of this month, 100,553 people have signed, accounting for approximately one-half of the city's population.

    North China Military Region
    As of the beginning of this month, 3,968 people from units directly under the North China Military Region Headquarters and Political Department have signed. Most units of the military region have held mobilization and propaganda meetings. After the meetings, even more people enthusiastically signed. Many soldiers with limited literacy did not want others to sign for them in order to solemnly express their determination to defend peace, and personally wrote their names stroke by stroke. Commanders and fighters expressed their views on defending world peace on signature books, in informal newsletters, and at discussion forums. An air force unit wrote on the peace appeal: "Our new China's air force will definitely fight to the end for lasting world peace and the permanent happiness of all mankind. We will make those imperialists who dare to launch wars perish under our iron wings!" Soldier Zhao Peizhang from a certain unit even wrote a quick-rhyme poem: "I wipe my gun bright and shiny, New bullets loaded to the top; War peddlers want to make trouble, We'll definitely send them to meet the King of Hell!" The signature campaign is now being enthusiastically carried out throughout the military region.
    East China Military Region
    More than 95,000 commanders and fighters of the land, sea, and air forces of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army stationed in Nanjing have signed. Special Forces Columns, the Navy, and various departments of the East China Military and Political University have universally convened peace preservation signature meetings and solemnly swore oaths at the meetings. The oath of all commanders and fighters of a certain naval warship was: "We must unite as one, intensify military training, and complete the liberation of Taiwan and Kinmen, and completely eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits supported by U.S. imperialism, in order to defend world peace." Many commanders and fighters also wrote collective or individual peace preservation pledges and submitted them to their superiors. The children and staff of the military region's children's schools and nurseries also signed at the "June 1st" International Children's Day celebrations. Yang Lizhen, the son of martyr Yang Zhaofa, wrote on the signature book: "My father was killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries with the help of U.S. imperialism. I oppose wars of aggression and don't want children to lose their fathers and mothers."
    Chongqing

Workers and shop assistants in various factories, docks, and shops not only signed themselves, but also actively organized many propaganda groups to go deep into the alleys, shantytowns, and peddling areas to mobilize the vast number of residents to sign.
