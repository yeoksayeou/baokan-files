Implementing the "Safety First" Production Policy
State-Run Jiaozuo Coal Mine Improves Safety Work
Casualty Rate Reduced by Three-Quarters Compared to Last Year in Five Months
[Our Newspaper] The state-run Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Pingyuan Province has earnestly implemented the "Safety First" production policy of the First National Coal Mine Conference. In the past six months, it has modified the continuous ventilation system into a zonal ventilation system, overcoming the shortcomings of insufficient wind speed and easy accumulation of flammable gases in the return air zone; established a series of safety work systems; and mobilized the masses to actively pay attention to safety work. As a result, the mine's productivity has increased and the casualty rate has been greatly reduced. From January to May of this year, the casualty rate per 10,000 tons of coal produced was 25% of last year's casualty rate, a reduction of three-quarters.

During the period when the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries operated the mine, the underground tunnels were excavated in a very chaotic manner, some even collapsed, due to non-compliance with mining rules. The Kuomintang reactionaries also looted the mine's equipment, which increased the difficulty of engineering construction after the mine was liberated in October 1948. After liberation, due to the lack of management experience of the mine's leading comrades, there was a tendency to emphasize production over engineering, and to emphasize the objective difficulties caused by the sabotage of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Until the First National Coal Mine Conference last October, although the factory had made considerable achievements in production, there were still serious problems in safety work. In the past year, the number of casualties, both above and below ground, reached as many as 910.

After the First National Coal Mine Conference, the leading comrades of the mine began to accept the idea of "Safety First." In late November of last year, the Party Committee and the Management Committee of the mine reviewed the past thinking of neglecting safety, proposed active improvement methods, and organized technical personnel to go deep into the front line to study and solve problems in safety work. During the discussion, it was discovered that the Huangtugang production team of the mine was conducting mutual inspections and mutual assistance, and had established various safety systems, which reduced the casualty rate. This was immediately publicized as a model for improving safety work. At the same time, experienced veteran workers were organized to discuss the painful lessons of the casualties that had occurred in the mine over the past 50 years, which made the workers generally aware of the importance of safety work.

After the workers were mobilized, the Management Committee, after research, formulated three systems: the "Responsibility System," the "Shift Handover System," and the "Inspection System," in response to the most important shortcomings in the mine's production at that time. In order to implement the responsibility system, the workers actively put forward many specific opinions on improving engineering construction, mechanical repair, and management systems. A safety inspection team was also established to inspect and supervise the implementation of correct administrative opinions on improving safety work.

The mine also clearly stipulated, according to the actual work situation, that the underground production team leader is responsible for inspection underground. He goes down the mine half an hour before work every day to check whether there is gas, whether the roof and walls are in dangerous condition, and whether there are any accidents or damages to machines and tools, before taking over the shift. The Management Committee also organized an inspection team to select several key areas and go down the mine every day to check the implementation of the handover system. If any adverse phenomena are found, they are immediately corrected. The mine also organized technical personnel to go down the mine to ensure that there are technical personnel underground 24 hours a day. If any situation is found, improvements can be studied immediately.

In terms of safety organization, safety committees were established in each mine, with teams, squads, and groups under them. The entire mine has more than 600 safety officers, and each production team has one or more safety officers responsible for safety work.

Since the mine basically completed the reconstruction of the ventilation system in February this year, the underground workers have increased the amount of fresh air, and the speed of coal mining per person per hour has increased from two or three cubic meters to three or five cubic meters. Starting in January, the management of harmful gases underground was established. The technical personnel working underground report the gas and carbon monoxide situation in the mine every day, so that the gas situation in the mine can be grasped every day, and regular research is conducted to prevent accidents. In various projects, special emphasis is placed on specifications, and random work is resolutely opposed. As a result of the strengthened safety work, 34 teams in the mine have had no work-related injuries from January to May this year (26 teams have had no work-related accidents from July last year to May this year). Only two workers died above and below ground, 18 were seriously injured, and 102 were slightly injured. In the first quarter, the mine's casualty rate was 0.1 deaths per 10,000 tons of coal, a decrease of 77% compared to last year, and 3.34 injuries, a decrease of 77.5% compared to last year.

Now, ensuring safety has become one of the most important regular tasks of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine. When selecting heroes and models in February this year, safe production was listed as one of the reward conditions. When evaluating wages in March, safety was also listed as an evaluation standard along with technology and achievements.

### 贯彻“保安第一”的生产方针  国营焦作煤矿改善保安工作  五个月来伤亡率比去年减低四分之三

　　贯彻“保安第一”的生产方针
    国营焦作煤矿改善保安工作
    五个月来伤亡率比去年减低四分之三
    【本报讯】平原省国营焦作煤矿，认真贯彻第一次全国煤矿会议“保安第一”的生产方针，半年来修改了连续式风道为分区风道，克服了回风地带风速不足，容易积存燃烧性气体的缺点；建立了一系列的保安工作制度；同时发动群众积极注意保安工作，因而该矿生产力较前提高，伤亡率大大减少。今年一月至五月每产万吨煤中的伤亡率，相当于去年的伤亡率百分之二十五，就是减低了四分之三。
    远在日寇及国民党反动派经营时期，该矿由于不按规则开采，井下巷道多挖掘得很是混乱，有的甚至坍塌；国民党反动派还把矿内的器材盗劫一空，致使该矿于一九四八年十月解放后，增加了工程修筑的困难。解放后，因矿山领导同志缺乏管理经验，存在着重生产轻工程的思想，而又强调国民党反动派破坏所造成的客观困难，直至去年十月全国第一次煤矿会议前，该厂虽在生产上已做出相当成绩，但在保安工作上，仍然存在着严重的问题。在去年一年内，井上下伤亡人数共达九百一十人之多。
    第一次全国煤矿会议后，该矿领导同志开始接受了保安第一的思想，于去年十一月下旬，在该矿党委会及管委会上，检讨了过去轻视保安的思想，提出积极的改进办法，并组织技术人员深入现场，研究解决保安工作上的问题。在讨论中，发现了该矿黄土岗生产小组互相检查，互相帮助，定出各种保安制度，使伤亡率减少，当即进行普遍宣传，以作改进保安工作的思想准备。同时又组织了有经验的老工人，座谈该矿五十年来所发生惨痛的伤亡事件的教训，因而使工人普遍的认识到安全工作的重要。
    当工人发动起来以后，管委会经过研究，针对该矿当时生产中最重要的缺点，订立了“责任制”、“交接班制”、“检查制”等三种制度。工人们为了实现责任制，积极地提出了很多关于改进工程修筑、机械修理及管理制度等方面的具体意见。并成立了保安检查小组，检查与监督行政上对改进保安工作正确意见的执行。
    该矿又按实际工作情况，明确规定了在井下负检查责任的是井下生产组长。他每天在上班前三十分钟下井，检查有无瓦斯，“天”和“帮”有无危险的现象，机器及工具有无事故及破损的情况等，然后才接班。管委会也组织检查组，选择了几个重点，每天下井检查交接制执行的情况，遇有不良的现象，立即提出改正。该矿并组织技术人员下井，保证在二十四小时内，井下都有技术人员，如发现情况，可立即研究改进。
    在保安组织上，各矿建立了保安委员会，下设大队、分队与小组。全矿共有保安员六百多人，每一生产小组都有一个以上的保安员，负责保安工作。
    该矿自今年二月基本完成改修风道工程后，井下工人由于新鲜空气量增多，每人一小时的采煤速度已从二、三立方米提高到三、五立方米。并从一月份开始，建立了井下有害气体的管理，下井工作的技术人员，每日把井下的瓦斯及一氧化碳等气体情况作表报告，每天可掌握井下气体的情况，并定期研究，以防止事故发生。在各种工程上，特别强调规格，坚决反对随便乱作。保安工作加强的结果，使该矿自今年一月至五月有三十四个小组没有出过公伤（从去年七月到今年五月没有公伤事故发生的小组，有二十六个），井上下仅死亡工人二名，重伤十八名，轻伤一○二名。第一季该矿的伤亡率为每万吨煤死亡零点一人，较去年减少了百分之七十七，受伤三点三四人，较去年减少了百分之七十七点五。
    现在，保障安全已成为焦作煤矿重要的经常工作之一。今年二月评选英雄模范时，安全生产被列为奖励条件之一。三月份评议工资时，保安亦与技术、成绩等同被列为评议标准。
