(Xinhua News Agency, June 24th) The following is the full text of the speech by Pan Hannian, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 22nd:

Chairman, fellow members, comrades:

	We fully agree with and support Vice Chairman Liu's report on the land reform issue and the draft Land Reform Law. It correctly indicates the principles and steps for carrying out land reform in the newly liberated areas. We will certainly complete this arduous task of great historical significance cautiously and resolutely. Premier Zhou's political report and the financial and tax reports of Directors Chen and Bo, as well as the reports of other responsible government comrades, have made us clearly aware of the favorable domestic and international situation and the direction of our efforts. We should arrange and inspect our work and educate our cadres based on the policies and guidelines put forward in these reports, and respond to Chairman Mao's call to "struggle to overcome difficulties and strive for the improvement of the economic situation!"

	In East China, especially in Shanghai, the largest industrial and commercial city in the country, economic recovery and transformation have encountered more and greater difficulties due to the long-term exploitation by imperialism and reactionaries, the blockade and bombing by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in collusion with US imperialism after liberation, and the severe disasters in many areas within East China. However, thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the national financial unification, the approaching balance of revenue and expenditure, and the increasingly stable prices have laid the foundation for us to overcome difficulties. In addition, the working people, industrialists, businessmen, and various democratic parties have united and worked together to successfully overcome the most difficult period.

	In the work of overcoming difficulties and maintaining production, there have been undeniable achievements, but there are also shortcomings. In public-private relations, a few cadres have the idea and practice of "public before private," and some even have the mistaken view of not being afraid to crush the small commodity economy. Another deviation is simply providing loans and processing without specifically guiding private enterprises to improve their management, which has led some industrialists and businessmen to continue the old method of borrowing money from the public to make a fortune as in the reactionary era, resulting in a lose-lose situation. After the enemy's bombing of Shanghai's power equipment on February 6th, industry and commerce fell into considerable difficulties. Not only did labor-capital relations become very tense due to issues such as wage arrears and dismissal fees, but the two major tasks of public debt and taxation also proceeded simultaneously. In the work, there was also a partial task-oriented viewpoint and a commandist style. On the one hand, many wealthy people did not buy public bonds, and on the other hand, organized industry and commerce could not afford it. The same was true for tax collection: on the one hand, there was a lot of tax evasion, and on the other hand, law-abiding people had more trouble in addition to paying taxes. This is an unfair and unreasonable phenomenon. In united front work, there are also some shortcomings, such as being afraid of trouble, not being humble, liking to take over everything, and having little consultation. This is mainly because they do not understand Chairman Mao's principles of "being somewhat different" and "treating everyone equally." We fully agree that these shortcomings, as pointed out by Premiers Zhou and Chen, should be the responsibility of the leadership organs at all levels! Shifting responsibility and blaming lower-level cadres is not right! Some people say that "the higher-ups are good, and the lower-downs are bad," which is also unfair. If the higher-ups are all good, the lower-downs should not be bad!

	The above situation has been reviewed and improved through the Third People's Representative Conference. After the meeting, the adjustment of public-private relations has been carried out in all aspects through extensive consultation and suggestions from the Consultative Committee and its various specialized groups. The cotton textile industry, which accounts for the largest proportion, has been restored to the production level of January of this year through the overall consideration of the East China Textile Conference. The East China Department Store alone has purchased more than 180 billion yuan of finished products from various factories in Shanghai in the past two months. Other production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood are gradually recovering production with the effective support of government orders, processing, procurement, and loans. In the tax collection work, the cooperation of the Consultative Committee and the Federation of Industry and Commerce has been obtained to effectively simplify procedures and improve work style. The democratic appraisal of industrial and commercial taxes also aims at achieving fairness and reasonableness without violating tax laws and tax rates. For unemployed cadres of various democratic parties, a special department is set up in the Revolutionary University to organize them to participate in learning, so as to have sufficient employment ability in the future.

	When we adjust public-private relations, we must abide by Chairman Mao's victorious conditions of "consolidating financial and economic unity, consolidating the balance of revenue and expenditure, and consolidating price stability." Because without these victories as a foundation, it will certainly be "public and private decline," and there is no point in talking about adjusting relations. Legitimate private enterprises must also understand the country's financial situation and still be in the struggle to overcome difficulties. The Central People's Government can only reduce the difficulties of private enterprises selectively and conditionally, and it is impossible to "respond to every request," so that everyone supports price stability and should not allow the state to increase currency issuance in order to maintain private enterprises. In order to reduce the burden on the people, the Central People's Government is determined to reduce administrative expenses, but the glorious tasks of liberating Taiwan and Tibet require huge expenditures. Therefore, the people of the whole country must consciously and voluntarily assume the obligation to pay taxes without evasion or leakage. In the reports of Directors Chen and Bo, we are told that the government has further simplified the tax system and improved the collection methods. We not only support these methods, but we must also actively shoulder the reasonable burden on the country to ensure the country's income. Regarding the united front, we should implement the principles instructed in Premier Zhou's report, distinguish between enemies and friends, and unite all forces that should be united to strive for the realization of the Common Program; we must patiently listen to different opinions, even opposing opinions. Any arrogance and complacency will isolate ourselves and become divorced from the masses. We must not be afraid to distinguish right from wrong and carry out ideological struggle in the face of the truth of serving the people, but the method must be through patient explanation and persuasive education, and its purpose is to consolidate unity, unanimously oppose the enemy, and serve the people. More importantly, the policy and thought of the united front must be implemented to the cadres of all departments, especially to hold people's representative meetings and consultative conferences regularly and with preparation to expand the political foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship.

	Vice Chairman Liu has instructed us to launch publicity and explanation work on land reform in the city. This is not only because Chinese industrialists, businessmen, and intellectuals have inextricable links with rural land, but also to prevent the landlord class from using the city as an air-raid shelter to oppose the propaganda and activities of land reform. All progressive industrialists, businessmen, and intellectuals, mobilize to complete the task of land reform!

	Fellow members, comrades, we must take concrete actions to implement the correct policies of the Central People's Government, and at the same time consolidate unity and work together under the banner of Chairman Mao to strive for the thorough realization of the Common Program!

    上海市人民政府副市长
    潘汉年的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】人民政协全国委员会委员、上海市人民政府副市长潘汉年二十二日在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我们完全同意并拥护刘副主席关于土地改革问题的报告，及土地改革法草案，他正确地指示了新解放区进行土改的方针和步骤，我们一定谨慎地同时又坚决地完成这个有重大历史意义的艰巨任务。周总理的政治报告和陈薄两主任的财经税收报告及其他各位政府负责同志的报告，使我们明确认识了国内外的有利形势和必须努力的方向，我们应当根据这些报告所提出的政策方针来布署工作、检查工作、和教育干部、以此响应毛主席号召的“为克服困难争取经济状况的好转而斗争！”
    华东方面，特别是上海，这个全国最大的工商业城市，由于帝国主义和反动派的长期榨取，由于解放后蒋匪帮勾结美帝的封锁和轰炸，由于华东范围内许多地区的严重灾荒，使得经济的恢复和改造，遇到了更多更大的困难；但由于毛主席及中央人民政府的正确领导，全国财经统一，收支接近平衡，物价日趋稳定，奠定了我们克服困难的基础，加上劳动人民、工商业家，及各民主党派，大家团结一致，共同努力，胜利地度过了最困难的时期。
    在克服困难维持生产的工作中，是有不可否定的成就，同时也存在着缺点。在公私关系中，少数干部有“先公后私”的想法和做法，个别的甚至有不怕挤垮小商品经济的错误观点。另一种偏向，则是单纯地贷款，加工，没有具体领导私营企业改善经营，以此造成一部分工商业者继续了反动时代向公家借钱发财的老办法，而结果是两败俱伤。二月六日敌机轰炸上海电力设备后，工商业陷入相当困难的境地，不仅劳资关系为了欠薪解雇费等问题闹得十分紧张，公债税收两大任务亦同时并进，工作中又有部分单纯任务观点和命令主义作风，一面有不少殷富不买公债，一面有组织的工商业不胜担负；税收亦复如此，一面有不少逃税漏税，一面奉公守法者纳税之外更多麻烦，这是不公平不合理的现象。统一战线工作中，也多少存在着怕麻烦，不虚心，好包办，少协商的缺点，这主要是由于没有了解毛主席“有所不同”和“一视同仁”的原则。这种种缺点，我们完全同意周陈两总理所指出应由各级领导机关负责！推卸责任，埋怨下级干部都不对！有人说“上级好，下级糟”也不公道，上级都好，下级就不应该糟！
    以上情况，经过第三次人民代表会议的检讨并定出改善步骤，会后由协商委员会及其各种专门小组，广泛协商和建议，已从各方面进行公私关系之调整，占比重最大的棉纺业，已由华东纺织会议统筹兼顾而恢复了本年一月份的生产水平，仅华东百货公司近两月中在上海已收购各厂成品达一千八百余亿，其他有利国计民生的生产事业，在政府定货、加工、收购、贷款等有效扶助下逐步恢复生产；税收工作，已取得协商会和工商联的合作，切实简化手续，改善作风，工商业税的民主评议，亦以不违反税法税率，达到公平合理为目的。对各民主党派的失业干部，在革命大学专设一系，组织他们参加学习，以使将来有充实的就业能力。
    我们调整公私关系的时候，一定要遵守毛主席的“巩固财经统一、巩固收支平衡、巩固物价稳定”的胜利条件。因为没有这些胜利作基础，一定是“公私皆枯”，谈不上调整关系。正当的私营企业，也一定要体会国家的财经情况，依然在克服困难的斗争中，中央人民政府，只能有重点、有条件地来减少私营企业的困难，不可能“有求必应”；为的是大家拥护物价稳定，就应该不让国家为了维持私营企业而增发通货。中央人民政府为了减轻民负，尽管下决心节减行政费用，但解放台湾西藏的光荣任务，需要庞大的开支，因此全国人民必须自觉自愿踊跃负起纳税义务，不漏税、不逃税。陈薄两主任报告中告诉我们，政府已进一步简化税制、改善稽征办法，我们不仅拥护这些办法，一定要踊跃肩负起对国家的合理负担，以保证国家的收入。关于统一战线，我们应该贯彻周总理报告中所指示的原则，分清敌友，团结一切应该团结的力量为实现共同纲领而奋斗；要耐心倾听不同的意见，甚至相反的意见，任何骄傲自负，都会孤立自己、脱离群众，要不怕在为人民服务的真理面前，辨别是非，进行思想斗争，但方法是必须通过耐心解释，说服教育，其目的在巩固团结，一致对敌，为人民服务；更重要的是统一战线的政策思想，要贯彻到各部门工作干部中去，尤其是定期有准备地开好人民代表会议和协商会议，扩大人民民主专政的政治基础。
    刘副主席曾指示我们要在城市展开关于土改的宣传解释工作，这不仅因为中国工商业家、知识分子与农村的土地有千丝万缕的联系，同时为了防止地主阶级利用城市做反对土改的宣传与活动的防空洞。一切前进的工商业家、知识分子，为完成土改任务动员起来！
    各位委员、各位同志，我们必须以具体的实际行动，来贯彻中央人民政府的正确方针，同时巩固团结，一致在毛主席的旗帜下为彻底实现共同纲领而努力！
