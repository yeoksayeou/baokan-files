	People's Korea's Primary Compulsory Education
	Liu E'ye

	Due to the political awakening of the Korean people and their understanding of the historical development of Korea and the direction of democratic national construction, since August 15, 1945, when the Korean people shook off the shackles of Japanese imperialism, all aspects of construction have developed with astonishing speed. The People's Economic Plan, in order to quickly eliminate the remnants of the long period of colonial rule and establish a democratic, unified, and independent country, and to improve the people's material and cultural living standards, has received enthusiastic support from the working masses. They guarantee to complete this great task, whether in mines, factories, enterprises, or in the vast countryside, and are fighting to complete it. Therefore, the People's Economic Plan not only restored the production enterprises destroyed by Japanese imperialism when they left, but also eliminated the colonial nature of Korean industry and established the foundation for new democratic economic construction. In 1949, enterprise production reached 102.8% of the original plan. Although the rural economy suffered an unprecedented drought, the total sown area of crops still maintained 102% of the plan, the wheat harvest exceeded the plan by 3.6%, and miscellaneous grains exceeded the plan by 24.8%. The total grain harvest was 626,491 tons more than the highest agricultural harvest of 1944 during the Japanese imperialist rule. Workers' wages also increased by 15.1% compared to 1948.

	Education is a reflection of politics and economy. The Korean people have their own people's regime. On the day the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established, Premier Kim Il-sung emphasized the importance of promoting cultural and educational work in his political report. In 1942, there were only 100 schools, but by 1949, the number of people's schools had increased to 3,882, with 359,485 children enrolled. In the past, there was not a single specialized university, but now there are 15, with 101,984 university students. At the same time, 89,717 children over the school age also entered adult schools. Although the number of school-age children enrolled has greatly increased as a result of three or four years of efforts in cultural and educational undertakings, there are still more than one million school-age children and out-of-school adults in the vast countryside who have not had the opportunity to learn culture. Therefore, in the 1950 national budget, the Korean People's Government allocated 5,659,944,000 won for social and cultural undertakings out of a total expenditure of 26,722,748,000 won, accounting for about 21.18%. The education budget alone was 2,967,231,000 won, accounting for slightly more than 11.10% of the national expenditure. At the same time, in early January of this year, the Fourth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea also passed the decree on the implementation of universal primary compulsory education.

	The Supreme People's Assembly of Korea has given the Minister of Education (i.e., the Minister of Education) the greatest power to promote universal compulsory education and realize the work of the education sector in the Two-Year People's Economic Plan in 1950. The main task of implementing the universal primary compulsory education system is to ensure that all 1,499,403 school-age children aged seven to eight are enrolled in people's schools starting from September 1 this year. However, many children are out of school because they cannot afford tuition fees. Most of them do not have enough clothes and shoes to keep them warm, and they cannot come to school in ragged and thin clothes in the cold weather. In order to promote universal compulsory education, the Korean government is responsible for providing clothes and shoes at state-set prices for the children of some poor citizens. For a small number of commuting students, the government also makes every effort to solve their transportation problems between school and home and issue free tickets. Kindergartens are widely established throughout the country so that when the next semester starts, the pitiful orphans who have no parents and no home can live a happy and fulfilling life in the kindergartens.

	The first problem facing the implementation of universal primary compulsory education is that 1.5 million school-age children will be entering schools this autumn. Therefore, school classrooms, student dormitories, and teacher dormitories have become important issues in promoting this work. In order to solve this problem, the Korean government has ordered the country that all agencies that borrow or occupy educational buildings or school buildings must move out before April 1, 1950, and return them to the original educational institutions or schools. The government has also established a national housing system, taking back the important houses and other buildings across the country for national management and overall distribution, and trying its best to use them as school buildings. In addition, the Minister of Education has allocated a large amount of funds to build school buildings across the country and in factories, mines, and enterprises so that all school-age children can be enrolled when school starts this year. The Korean people have great enthusiasm for their own education. In the past year, they donated more than 766.47 million won for education and more than 1,939,000 people voluntarily participated in patriotic labor. This kind of patriotic enthusiasm has helped the country build 2,656 school buildings, 831 boarding schools, 477 temporary school buildings, and 8,966 teacher residences, and added 220,000 desks and 240,000 stools. This kind of people's voluntary patriotic spirit, contributing their own labor and financial resources, has played a great role in the country's promotion of universal education.

	Before liberation, there were only over one hundred schools in North Korea. After three or four years of construction after liberation, the number of people's schools has increased sharply to more than 3,880. This will increase on a large scale this autumn, which has caused the problem of a shortage of teachers. In addition to using the summer vacation to convene all teachers at all levels of schools to implement 20 days of political education in order to better exert the power of people's education, the Ministry of Education will also try its best to make those who have been engaged in education work in the past but have changed careers due to financial difficulties or other reasons return to their educational posts. In addition, according to the Two-Year People's Economic Plan, four normal schools and fourteen classes will be added. However, the increase in these schools cannot meet the current urgent needs. Therefore, it is planned to provide three months of intensive normal education training to this year's senior high school graduates, and then assign them to various places to serve as teachers in people's schools. On the other hand, the government is working harder to prevent teachers from changing careers, encouraging young people to engage in education, and providing all students in normal schools who are receiving professional training with scholarships. Their accommodation and fuel costs can also be paid from the national budget. The state provides guarantees and preferential treatment for in-service teachers. All teachers in people's schools can enjoy the allocation of clothing and shoes at state-set prices, and rural teachers can also obtain fuel allocated by the government free of charge. Each household can still obtain 50 ping of vegetable land, while urban teachers can increase the allocation of daily necessities. In order to solve the problem of teacher housing, the People's Committees of various places are responsible for providing housing land. The State Planning Commission and the Minister of Finance will, before September 1, 1950, provide credit loans of 50 million yuan to teachers in large cities as a fund for building personal housing and allocate the materials needed for construction at state-set prices. The Minister of Commerce is also responsible for establishing teacher stores in various cities and setting up sales venues exclusively for teachers to handle commodities in state-run stores in county seats so that teachers can smoothly purchase food, food products, daily necessities, and others. Teachers also have the right to take vacations. All working teachers from September 1 to the end of the school year will be given 24 days of vacation during the work days, and during the vacation, they can get the average amount of one month's total annual salary.

	Teachers have a great responsibility for implementing compulsory primary education, but the institutions that promote and lead this work are more important than teachers. The authorities of the Korean People's Government recognized this point and specially established an institution to implement and promote universal compulsory primary education. The Adult Education Department of the Ordinary Education Bureau of the Ministry of Education was abolished, and a Social Education Department was established, with one minister and nine teachers, directly under the Ministry of Education. A Social Education Section was also established in the Education Department of the People's Committees of various provinces, with one section chief and two inspectors. A Social Education Inspector was also established in the Education Section of the People's Committees of various cities and counties, separately responsible for leading, promoting, and inspecting compulsory education.

	The "Decree on the Implementation of Universal Primary Compulsory Education" passed by the Fourth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea in early January of this year shows that the Korean People's Government, with the enthusiastic support of the Korean people, is responsible for implementing Article 18 of Chapter 2 of the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which states that "citizens enjoy the right to education, primary education is universal compulsory education, and the state guarantees free education for children of poor citizens." At the same time, it is also responsible for thoroughly eradicating the colonial cultural thoughts of "Japanese Emperorism," "clarifying the national polity," and "turning people into subjects of the Emperor" left over by Japanese imperialism, and further arming the new democratic thoughts of all the Korean people.

　　人民朝鲜的初等义务教育
    刘鹗业
    由于朝鲜人民政治的觉悟，认识了朝鲜历史发展、民主主义国家建设的方向，自一九四五年八月十五日，朝鲜人民摆脱日本帝国主义的枷锁后，各方面建设，都有惊人迅速的发展，人民经济计划，为要迅速扫除过去长久时期的殖民地统治所遗留残余的恶毒，建立民主统一独立的国家，提高人民物质文化生活的水准，获得了劳动大众热烈支持，他们不论在矿山、工厂、企业，以及在广大农村里，都保证完成这种伟大的任务，都为完成这任务而斗争。所以，人民经济计划，不但恢复了日本帝国主义临走时所破坏的生产企业，并且扫除了朝鲜工业的殖民地性，建立了新民主主义的经济建设的基础。一九四九年企业生产，达到了原计划的百分之一○二·八。农村经济虽然遭遇空前大旱，农作物总播种面积，仍保持计划百分之一○二，麦类收获量超过计划百分之三·六，杂谷超过计百分之二四·八，合计谷物总收获量较日帝统治时代农产收获最高的一九四四年增加六二六、四九一吨。工人工资亦较一九四八年，增加了百分之一五·一。
    教育是政治经济的反映。朝鲜人民有了自己人民的政权。在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府成立那一天，首相金日成报告政纲的时候，特别强调推行文教工作的重要，在一九四二年学校仅有一○○所，而到了一九四九年，人民学校已增到三八八二所；入学儿童三五九、四八五名；过去没有一所专科大学，现在却有了十五所，大学生一○一、九八四人，同时还有八九七一七名的超过学龄儿童，亦进入成人学校。文教事业，虽然经过三四年努力的结果，学龄儿童就学人数，已大大的增加，可是在广大农村里还有一百多万的学龄儿童与失学成人，他们仍没有得到学习文化的机会。所以朝鲜人民政府，在一九五○年国家预算岁出二六、七二二、七四八、○○○元中，社会文化事业费占五、六五九、九四四、○○○元，约百分之二一·一八，单就教育事业费亦有二、九六七、二三一、○○○元，占国家岁出百分之一一·一○强。同时在今年元月初旬，朝鲜最高人民会议第四届会议，也通过了关于实施全般初等义务教育的法令。
    朝鲜最高人民会议给予教育相（即教育部部长）最大的权力，来推行全般义务教育，实现二年人民经济计划一九五○年教育部门的工作。实施全般初等义务教育制度，主要的任务，是保障七岁到八岁全体学龄儿童一、四九九、四○三人，在今年九月一日起，一律就学于人民学校。但是，许许多多的儿童，因为缴纳不起学费而失学，他们多半没有足够御寒的衣服与鞋子，他们也不能穿着破烂单薄的衣服，冒着寒冷来上学，朝鲜政府为了要推行全般义务教育，对于部分贫困公民的子弟，国家负责以国定价格配给他衣服和鞋子，对于少数通学学生，政府亦尽最大力量，解决他们往返学校与家庭间的交通问题，发给免票乘车券。在全国各地普遍建立爱育院，在下学期开学的时候，使没有父母无家可归的可怜孤儿，都能在爱育院中，过着愉快美满的生活。
    推行全般初等义务教育，面临着头一个问题，就是在今年秋天，将有一百五十万名的学龄儿童，将要进入学校，那么学校课室，学生宿舍，教师宿舍，成了推行这工作的重要问题，朝鲜政府为了要解决这个问题，已通令全国，凡借用或占用有关教育方面的建设物或学校校舍的机关，一律在一九五○年四月一日以前搬出，归还原教育机关或学校，政府还确立国有房屋制度，把全国重要房屋及其他建筑物收回国家管理统筹支配，并且尽量设法作为学校校舍之用，另外教育相拨了大宗款项在全国各地以及工厂、矿山、企业公司等地，建设学校校舍，以便在今年开学时，使学龄儿童全部入学。朝鲜人民对于人民自己的教育有很大热忱，在过去一年中乐捐教育经费七亿六百四十七万余元，自动参加爱国劳动的大众，有一百九十三万九千多人，这种爱国热情帮助国家建立了二千六百五十六所校舍，寄宿舍八百三十一所，临时性校舍四百七十七所，教员住宅八千九百六十六所，添制桌子二十二万张，凳子二十四万张，这种人民自动爱国精神，贡献出自己的人力财力，对国家推行普及教育工作，起了很大的作用。
    北朝鲜在没有解放以前，学校不过一百余所，解放后经过三、四年的建设，人民学校激增到三千八百八十余所，到今年秋季还要大规模的增多，这样在短时间内的突增，引起了缺少教师的问题。教育省除利用暑假时间，召集各级学校全体教员，实施二十日的政治教育，以便更高发挥人民教育的力量，同时将过去从事教育工作的人，因为生活困难或其他原因而转业者，朝鲜政府亦极力设法使其返回教育岗位外，并依照二年人民经济计划，增加师范专门学校四校十四学级，但是这种学校的增加实不能应付目前迫切的需要。所以计划将今年高级中学校毕业学生，施以三个月速成师范教育的训练，然后分发各地充当人民学校教师。政府另一方面更努力防止教师转业，奖励青年从事教育工作，对于正在受专业训练的师范专门学校学生，全部施以奖学金制，他们的寄宿费燃料费，亦可由国家预算中支付。对于在职教师，国家给予保障与优待，凡人民学校的教员，都能享受国定价格服装及鞋的配给品，农村教师并能无代价得到政府配给的燃料，每户仍能获得五十坪菜地，城市教员则增加生活必需品的配给量。为了教员住宅问题，各地人民委员会负贷予住宅基地，国家计划委员会及财政相除在一九五○年九月一日以前，持出五千万元的信用贷款，给大城市教员作为建筑个人住宅的基金，并以国定价格配给建筑上所需要的材料。商业相亦负责在各城市设立教员商店，郡所在地之国营商店附设专为教员办理商品的贩卖场，使教员们能够很顺利购买到粮食、食用品、生活必需品及其他。教员并享有休假权利，凡九月一日起至学年终末的工作教员，给予劳动日中二十四日的休假，在休假期间，并能得到一个月本人一年总薪俸的平均额。
    实施义务初等教育，教师是负有很大的责任，但是推行与领导这种工作的机构，却较教师更为重要。朝鲜人民政府当局，认识了这一点，特设立一种实施与推行领导全般义务初等教育的机构，将教育省普通教育局中的成人教育部撤销，另设社会教育部，设部长一人教学九人，直属于教育省；在各道人民委员会教育部内，亦设立社会教育课，设置课长一人，视学二人；在各市郡区域人民委员会教育课内，亦设社会教育视学一人，分别负责领导推行视察义务教育工作。
    朝鲜最高人民会议第四届会议，在今年元月上旬通过的《关于实施全般初等义务教育的法令》，就是表明朝鲜人民政府，在朝鲜人民热烈拥护与支持下，负责把民主主义人民共和国宪法第二章第十八条“公民享受教育的权利，初等教育为全般义务制，国家保障贫穷公民的子女免费教育”付诸实现，同时也就是负责彻底肃清日本帝国主义所遗留的“日本天皇主义”“国体明征”“皇国臣民化”殖民地文化的思想，进一步武装全朝鲜人民的新民主思想。
