Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 8th: In order to facilitate the planned adjustment of industry and commerce, the Central South Region has begun industrial and commercial registration work in all towns with a population of more than 30,000 throughout the region. The "Provisional Measures for Industrial and Commercial Registration in the Central South Region" formulated by the Trade Department of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee and approved by the Central South Military and Administrative Committee, the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Measures for Industrial and Commercial Registration in the Central South Region," and the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Itinerant Traders in the Central South Region" have all been promulgated and implemented since May 26. The Provisional Measures for Industrial and Commercial Registration in the Central South Region stipulate that all state-owned, public-owned, joint public-private, and private industrial and commercial enterprises, except for cooperatives and stall vendors (who will be governed by separate regulations), must apply for registration in accordance with these measures from the date of promulgation. The registered capital of industrial and commercial applicants should be re-evaluated based on actual assets. If any established industrial and commercial enterprises have shares of bureaucrat-capital or war criminal capital, they must be reported truthfully and in detail, and must not be concealed; otherwise, once discovered, they will be punished according to law. Those engaged in construction, banking, money houses, insurance, trust, theaters, cinemas, dance halls, and other businesses must obtain a permit from the competent authority for each industry before applying for registration. Industrial and commercial enterprises that privately open for business without applying for registration and approval from the People's Government in accordance with the law shall be ordered to cease business and shall be subject to appropriate punishment. Industrial and commercial households that have been established before the promulgation of this law shall apply for registration within the prescribed time limit from the date of promulgation of these measures; failure to do so will be regarded as privately opening for business. All previous "Provisional Measures for Industrial and Commercial Registration" issued by various localities before the promulgation of these measures shall be repealed.
	In order to ensure the smooth progress of industrial and commercial registration work, the Trade Department of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee has decided to focus on Wuhan City, create experience, and guide the entire region. The department also ordered local industrial and commercial bureaus to form industrial and commercial registration committees based on the specific circumstances, consisting of industrial and commercial departments, taxation, banks, public security, state-owned companies, federations of industry and commerce, and shop employee unions, to cooperate in the registration work. The registration work in the major cities of the region, with the exception of some cities in Guangdong and Guangxi, will strive to be completed before the end of June.
	On the same day that the Wuhan Yangtze River Daily published the Provisional Measures for Industrial and Commercial Registration of the Trade Department of the Central South Region, it published a commentary calling on industrial and commercial operators to dispel certain unnecessary concerns and help the government do a good job in industrial and commercial registration. Only through registration, so that the government understands the true situation of industrial and commercial operators, can it plan and adjust industry and commerce, adjust production and sales, and better adjust taxation, and correct the unreasonable phenomena in tax collection in some cities. This is beneficial and harmless to legitimate industrial and commercial operators.

　　为便于有计划地调整工商业
    中南区开始工商业登记工作
    全区争取月底前大部登记完毕
    【新华社汉口八日电】中南区为便于有计划地调整工商业，已在全区三万人口以上的各城镇开始工商业的登记工作。由中南军政委员会贸易部所制订并由中南军政委员会所核准的《中南区工商登记暂行办法》，《中南区工商业登记暂行办法施行细则》，《中南区行商管理暂行办法》都已从五月二十六日起公布施行。中南区工商登记暂行办法规定：无论国营、公营、公私合营以及私营工商业，除合作社、摊贩另行规定外，都须按该办法自即日起申请登记。工商业者申请登记之资本额，应以实有财产重新估值。已经开设的工商业内，如有官僚资本或战犯资本股份的，都应据实详报，不得隐匿；否则一经查觉，就将依法惩处。凡是经营营造业、银行、钱庄、保险、信托、戏院、影院、舞厅等业务的，须经各该业主管机关的许可，领得许可证以后，方得申请登记；工商业未经依法向人民政府申请及核准登记而私自开业的，除应停止其营业外，并予适当处分。在该法公布前已经开设的工商业户，应自该办法公布之日起，按照规定期限，申请登记；逾期以私自开业论。在该办法公布以后，各地以前所颁发的《工商业登记暂行办法》一律作废。
    中南军政委员会贸易部为了使工商业登记工作能顺利进行，决定以武汉市为工作重点，创造经验，指导全区。该部并同时着令各地工商厅、局，根据具体情况，由工商部门、税务、银行、公安、国营公司、工商联合会、店员工会等，组成工商业登记委员会，配合进行登记工作。全区主要城市的登记工作除两广的部分城市外，将争取在六月底以前完成。
    武汉长江日报在刊布中南区贸易部工商业登记暂行办法同日发表评论，号召工商业者应该解除某些不必要的顾虑，帮助政府办好工商业登记工作。只有经过登记，使政府了解工商业者真实情况，才能有计划地调整工商业，调整产销，并更好的调整税收，纠正目前某些城市税收中的不合理现象。这对正当工商业者是有利无害的。
