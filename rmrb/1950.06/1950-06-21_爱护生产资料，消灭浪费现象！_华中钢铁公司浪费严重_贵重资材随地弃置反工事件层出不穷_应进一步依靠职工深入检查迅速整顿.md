　　Cherish Production Materials, Eliminate Waste!
    Serious Waste at Central China Iron and Steel Company
    Valuable Materials Discarded, Rework Incidents Abound
    Should Further Rely on Workers for Thorough Inspection and Swift Rectification
    [Hankou News] Changjiang Daily News: Comrade Gao Yunsheng of the Supervision Committee of the Daye Central China Iron and Steel Company recently conveyed the resolutions of the Central and Southern Heavy Industry Conference and Vice Chairman Deng Zihui's summary report at the conference in the company. Preliminary inspection of the company's work revealed extremely serious chaos and waste in material storage and production, causing significant losses to state property. This indifference to the loss of people's property and extremely irresponsible behavior fully demonstrates the serious shortcomings in the company's leadership, organizational structure, and systems, which urgently need further reliance on the masses of workers for thorough inspection and swift rectification and reform.
    The waste caused by the chaos in raw materials and supplies storage, procurement, and distribution in the company is as follows:
    I. Losses from firebricks alone amount to 40,000 shi of rice. Before liberation, 3,663 tons of firebricks were transported from Qingdao. It is said that due to the urgent time limit, some were damaged during unloading, accounting for about one-tenth of the total. After liberation, the firebricks were transported from the dock to the company gate, but due to the irresponsibility of the person in charge, no proper arrangements were made with the contractor, resulting in chaotic loading and unloading, and the 58 specifications were mixed up. They were moved again during the inventory last year. As a result, except for the 300 tons borrowed by the Daye Power Plant and a small number stored in the machinery warehouse in boxes, 99% were incomplete and broken, of which one-third were unusable broken bricks, totaling about 160,000 pieces. Calculated at 1.5 dou of rice per piece for new, substandard firebricks from China Cement Company, 160,000 pieces amount to 24,000 shi of rice. The loss from processing and grinding the remaining two-thirds of the broken bricks may be one-third. Combining the calculations, the total is no less than 40,000 shi of rice, equivalent to 5.2 billion yuan.
    Lack of management and systems has caused serious waste in material storage, leadership, and use.
    II. Extreme chaos inside and outside the warehouses. Many warehouses are closed, containing only a few machines or some iron materials, while large quantities of valuable equipment and materials are left in the open. Many have already been soaked in water and rusted during this unpacking and inventory. Various machine parts, boilers, motors, steel wire ropes, iron wire ropes, screws, rivets, railway, and building materials are scattered everywhere. As a result, many items were missed in last year's inventory. Until recently, three boxes of high-voltage magnetic bottles, small motors, and a large number of valuable equipment were found by the river and in the weeds. A large number of valuable machines and mining equipment at the Tieshan storage area are stored in the open, left to corrode and rust, some even soaked in water for a long time without proper care. Light rails and various steel parts are scattered all over the mountains, many stolen by criminals or covered by silt. A lot of valuable asbestos tiles, cement tiles, steel plates, scrap iron, and scrap steel are scattered everywhere, catching the eye.
    III. Many warehouse management personnel do not know the names, specifications, quantities, uses, and storage methods of the equipment stored in their warehouses. They are not proficient in their work and do not communicate with the user departments, resulting in serious chaos and waste in the procurement, distribution, storage, and use of raw materials.
    IV. When buying materials, due to the lack of clear specifications and the lack of a sense of careful calculation and ownership, a large number of materials that are not suitable for use or will not be used up in a few years are purchased. For example, one-third of the coke purchased this time needs to be returned, resulting in large transportation losses.
    V. Chaotic storage and distribution system. The engineering and material storage departments do not have a clear system of responsibility for storage and distribution. Regardless of the amount of materials requested or whether they should be purchased, they approve the requests without review, thus opening the door to corruption and waste. Various factories often request more materials than actually needed. Many old or substandard materials could be used as substitutes, but everyone strives to get good materials. As a result, when there are important projects and production tasks, they have to spend money to purchase them. The above serious phenomena are ignored by cadres, and they do not pay attention to the valuable opinions raised by workers.
    Poor planning, sloppy work, rework wastes materials, affecting production.
    In terms of production, due to poor planning, drawing errors, and the self-righteousness of some engineering designers who do not adopt workers' reasonable suggestions, rework and waste of materials occur frequently. To repair and build the No. 2 ship, 30,000 rivets were made, each four fen too long, resulting in rework to cut off the excess. The backrest on the 17-inch rolling mill cast in the steelmaking plant was 100 mm off due to a model error, and had to be recast. Other rework phenomena are too numerous to mention, not only causing huge waste of manpower and materials, but also hindering the timely completion of production tasks.
    In contracting, the contracted prices and estimates for general projects are very high. Leveling the foundation of the rolling mill was highly estimated due to design errors, resulting in a lot of extra money spent, while the original high places were leveled lower, requiring additional contracting to fill them higher.
    On the issue of overtime, due to insufficient planning in production, rework often occurs, resulting in extremely abnormal day and night overtime. The company's total overtime in March was 43,800 hours, equivalent to 7,133 workdays. The overtime pay was equal to the full monthly salary of 240 people. Even warehouse keepers and office clerks have a lot of overtime every month. As a result, many people in the company receive one and a half months' salary, but there is no necessary overtime work. This abnormal overtime phenomenon not only affects the health of the workers and reduces the efficiency of normal production time, but also seriously hinders the unity of the workers in various factories and increases the cost of products.
    In addition, there are many unnecessary wastes. The company consumed more than 115,000 kWh of electricity in March, of which non-production electricity accounted for one-fifth. In addition to production water, the company consumes more than 29,000 tons of water per month, averaging nearly five tons per person per month. The electricity cost for pumping water alone requires more than 60 shi of rice per month.

　　爱护生产资料，消灭浪费现象！
    华中钢铁公司浪费严重
    贵重资材随地弃置反工事件层出不穷
    应进一步依靠职工深入检查迅速整顿
    【汉口讯】长江日报消息：大冶华中钢铁公司监委高芸生同志，最近在该公司传达了中南重工业会议决议和邓子恢副主席在该会议上的总结报告，初步检查了该公司的工作，发现该公司在材料保管和生产方面混乱与浪费现象极为严重，使国家财产遭受极大损失。从这些对人民财产损失的熟视无睹，和极不负责任的行为中，充分表现出该公司在领导方面，组织机构及制度方面存在着严重的缺点，急待进一步依靠职工群众，深入检查，予以迅速整顿改革。
    该公司由于原材料和资材的保管、采购、领发等方面的混乱而造成的浪费现象有下面几种：
    一、仅耐火砖一项损失，折合大米即达四万石。解放前，由青岛运来耐火砖三千六百六十三吨，据说，因当时限期仓促，卸时损坏一批，损失约占十分之一。解放后将该批耐火砖由码头运到公司大门里，但由于主管人不负责任，没有和包商讲好，乱装乱卸，把五十八种规格弄了个乱七八糟。去年清点时又搬弄一次。结果除大冶电厂借用的三百吨和少数成箱者存放机械库外，已有百分之九十九残破不全，其中不能用的断砖就有三分之一，约合十六万块。以华新水泥公司新买次等火砖，每块一斗五升米计算，十六万块共合大米二万四千石，其余三分之二的残砖加工磨制的损失，可能有三分之一，合并计算，总数不下四万石大米，折合人民币五十二亿。
    没有管理，没有制度，造成资料保管、领导和使用上的严重浪费。
    二、仓库内外极为混乱。很多库房闭着，只放几部机器，或盛了些铁料，而大批贵重器材和物资，都扔在露天不管。这次开箱清点，很多已经浸水锈坏。各种机件、锅炉、马达、钢丝绳、铁丝绳、螺丝、铆钉、铁道和建筑器材，东抛西弃，到处可见。因而去年清点中很多东西漏账。直至最近，又在江边和乱草堆中发现了三箱高压磁瓶、小马达和大批贵重器材。铁山保管处大批贵重机器和采矿输矿设备存放露天，任其腐蚀生锈，有的竟长期泡在水中，未加适当保管。轻便轨和各种钢铁零件满山遍野，很多被歹徒偷窃或被淤泥覆没，很多贵重的石棉瓦、洋灰瓦、钢铁板、废铁、废钢，东一片，西一片，触目皆是。
    三、很多仓库管理人员，不知本库所存器材的名称、规格、数量、用途和保管方法，业务不通也不与使用部门联系，造成了原材料的采购、领发、保管、使用等各方面的严重混乱与浪费现象。
    四、买材料时，由于没有明确的规格要求，和缺乏精打细算当家做主的思想，买回大批材料不合应用或几年用不完的也很多。如此次买回焦炭，竟有三分之一须要退换，来回运输损失很大。
    五、保管、领发制度混乱。工务和材料保管部门，没有一个明确的保管和领发的责任制度，不问领料多少，不管应否采购，未经审查即盖章批准，因此给贪污浪费开了大门。各厂领料往往超过实际所需，很多旧料或次等货色本可以代用，但大家都争着领好料，结果，有了重要工程和生产任务，又得花钱请购。以上种种严重现象，干部们熟视无睹，对工友们提的宝贵意见不加理睬。
    计划不周，工作潦草，反工费料，影响生产。
    在生产方面：由于计划不周，绘图错误，和某些工程设计人员自以为是，不采纳工人合理建议的结果，造成了层出不穷的反工费活现象。为修造二号船打铆钉三万个，每个长出四分，结果必须反工，把长出来的部分截去。炼钢厂铸十七英寸轧钢机上的靠背，竟因模型弄错，相差一百米厘，重新再铸。其他反工现象不胜枚举，不但造成人力物力的巨大浪费，也障碍了生产任务的及时完成。
    在包工上，一般工程包价和估价都很高。轧钢厂平地基，因设计错误，估价很高，结果多花很多钱，而原来高的地方反而平低了，得另外包工再填高。
    在加班问题上，由于生产上计划性不够，经常发生反工，造成了极不正常的昼夜加班现象。全公司三月份的加班，有四万三千八百小时，折合七千一百三十三个工，加班费等于二百四十个人的全月工资。甚至连在仓库负责保管工作和办公室的勤务员，每月都有很多加班。因此，该公司很多人一个月拿了一个半月的工资，但却没有什么必要加班的工作。这种反常的加班现象，不仅影响了工友们的身体健康，降低了正常生产时间的工作效率，也严重地妨碍了各厂工友的团结，提高了产品的成本费。
    此外，还有许多不应有的浪费，该公司三月份用电十一万五千余度，其中非生产用电即占五分之一。除生产用水以外，全公司每月用水两万九千余吨，每人每月平均用水将近五吨。光汲水用电费每月即须开支大米六十余石。
