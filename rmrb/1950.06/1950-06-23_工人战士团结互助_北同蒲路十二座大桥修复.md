　　Workers and Soldiers Unite and Help Each Other
    Restoration of Twelve Bridges on the North Tongpu Railway
    [Report from this newspaper] The restoration project of twelve bridges between Pingwang and Shuoxian on the North Tongpu Railway, undertaken by the First Engineering Office of the Railway Corps, with the assistance of some soldiers dispatched by the Sixth Detachment, and the support of local governments and the masses, has been completed, overcoming the difficulties of labor and material shortages. The twelve bridges under construction are scattered between 27 kilometers and 125 kilometers, making it difficult for trains and cars to pass. Moreover, since the construction of each bridge started successively in March of this year, it was during the spring thaw, the roads were muddy, and the transportation of materials was very difficult, often leading to work stoppages due to waiting for materials. To this end, workers and soldiers carried forward the glorious tradition of overcoming difficulties, and everyone went to collect sand and gravel, and mobilized the local people to carry wooden piles, solving many difficulties.
    During the construction, due to the close cooperation and unity between workers and soldiers, and the combination of high labor enthusiasm and technology, the project was successfully completed. When pouring the tenth bridge pier, the technical cadres first explained the composition and method of pouring concrete to the soldiers in detail, and assigned workers to each work group to provide specific help and guidance. If the soldiers couldn't do it, the workers patiently taught them. The soldiers learned quickly and their morale was high. The workers also regarded teaching the soldiers technical skills as their own responsibility. Moreover, they also learned from each other and encouraged each other in life and study, fully demonstrating a high degree of unity.
    The relationship between each construction site and the local people was also very harmonious. The local people did their best to help solve the difficulties of tools and housing by lending tools, cooking utensils, and housing. The workers and soldiers also took the initiative to help the local people with their work. Therefore, when the 112-kilometer bridge was completed, the local government presented the Second Engineering Team with two silk banners: "Pioneers of Road Opening" and "Bridge Repair Models".

　　工人战士团结互助
    北同蒲路十二座大桥修复
    【本报讯】北同蒲铁路平旺、朔县间十二座大桥修复工程，经铁道兵团第一工程处负责施工，第六支队派来一部分战士协助，在地方政府和群众的支援下，克服了缺工少料的困难，修复完竣。施工的十二座大桥，是分散座落在二十七公里至一二五公里之间，火车不通，汽车难行。并且自本年三月间各桥相继开工以后，正值春溶时期，道路泥泞，运料十分困难，时常发生停工待料的现象。为此，工人和战士们发扬了克服困难的光荣传统，大家去四处拉砂子、砸石碴，并结合动员的老乡抬木桩，解决了很多困难。
    在施工中，由于工人和战士间的密切配合互相团结，由于高度的劳动热情和技术相结合，使工程得以顺利完成。在灌注第十号桥墩时，技术干部先将灌注混凝土的成份及方法都详细的向战士们解释，分配工友到各工作小组里去具体帮助指导，战士们干不了，工友们就耐心的教，战士们学得又快，情绪愈高；工友们也都以教战士技术作为自己的责任。并且在生活和学习上，也都是互相学习，互相鼓励，充分表现出高度的团结精神。
    各个工地和老乡的关系，也都处得很融洽，借工具，炊具及住房子等，老乡们尽力帮助解决工具、房屋等困难。工友和战士们也主动帮助老乡劳动，因此当一一二公里桥竣工时，当地政府赠给了第二工程队“开路先锋”及“修桥模范”的两面锦旗。
