Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: The All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council (formerly translated as the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee) issued a declaration on June 3rd, protesting the illegal sentencing of eight patriots to long-term penal servitude by American imperialists for participating in the People's Assembly held in Tokyo on May 30th. The declaration was signed by Kaneko Kenta, member of the Executive Committee of the Council and member of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The declaration stated: Eight patriots who fought against instigating imperialist war and to defend peace and national independence have been finally sentenced. However, Japanese war criminals who slaughtered millions of people and bathed a large part of the world in blood have been released.

　　The eight patriots were sentenced in a swift trial of only five days, despite the fact that the legal proceedings required an extremely cautious review to determine their guilt or innocence. These sentences of five to ten years of penal servitude are among the most severe punishments since the war. This kind of punishment reminds us of the past when the fascists, led by Hideki Tojo, frantically suppressed and executed all patriots who opposed the Pacific War.

　　The declaration pointed out: We cannot help but believe that this judicial verdict is not merely a verdict against eight patriots, but rather the first step in political measures aimed at suppressing all Japanese workers and the Japanese people. If we do not resolutely wage a determined struggle against imperialism and reactionaries today, then, inevitably, not only will these eight patriots continue to suffer five to ten years of imprisonment, but all peace-loving and nationally independent working people of our motherland will live a prison-like, lifeless life. The time has come for us workers to choose a course of action: to be slaves of human beings, or to win a path to freedom, peace, and national independence through our own actions?

　　The declaration, after pointing out that the persecution of communists and laborers in India and Italy had not prevented the growth of the people's power, continued: "We, the Japanese workers united in the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council, hereby appeal to the World Federation of Trade Unions and other democratic forces around the world regarding this incident, and declare here: We will expand and strengthen the mass forces fighting alongside us to launch a movement to win the release of these eight innocent patriots."

　　美帝非法判处八位爱国者苦役
    日劳联发表抗议宣言
    号召人民以行动赢得自由独立
    【新华社二十五日讯】全日本工会联络协议会（前译全日本工会联络委员会），于六月三日发表宣言，抗议美国帝国主义者非法判处参加五月三十日在东京举行的人民大会的八位爱国者以长期苦役。该宣言由该协议会执行委员会委员、世界工会联合会执行委员会委员金子健太签名。宣言说：为反对挑拨帝国主义战争、为保卫和平和民族独立而斗争的八位爱国者，已经最后地被判决了。但是屠杀过千百万人民，使人民血流遍地淹着了世界很大一部分土地的日本战犯，却被释放了。
    八位爱国者仅在五天的迅速审判中，就被判决了，尽管在法律上需要极其慎重的审查，以判决他们有罪或无罪。这些五年至十年苦役的判决，是战后最严酷的一种处刑。这种处刑，使我们回想起从前以东条英机为首的法西斯，曾经疯狂地压迫与处决一切反对太平洋战争的爱国人士。
    宣言指出：我们不得不认为这种司法上的判决，不只是对于八位爱国者的判决，而是意味着对我们全体日本工人以及日本人民实行镇压的政治措施的第一步。今天我们如果不坚决地跟帝国主义和反动派展开坚决的斗争，那么，不可避免地，不仅是这八位爱国者要继续遭受五年至十年的徒刑，而且我们祖国全体爱好和平和民族独立的劳动人民，将要过监狱般的死沉沉的生活。我们工人要选择行动方向的时机已经到来了，是要作人间的奴隶呢，还是以自己的行动来赢得自由、和平与民族独立的出路？
    宣言在指出印度与意大利对共产党与劳工的迫害并未能阻止人民力量的增长后，继称：“我们团结在全日本工会联络协议会里的日本工人，对于这一事件，特向世界工会联合会和全世界其他民主力量发出呼吁，并且在这里声明：我们将扩大和加强和我们一齐斗争的群众力量，展开运动，以争取释放这八位无罪的爱国者。”
