　　Wang Zhihong and Nai Dong's Opinions Can Both Be Used as Excuses by Compromisers and Waverers
    Li Ying, Shen Fuyue
    We believe that both of these (Wang Zhihong and Nai Dong) views are incorrect and fail to understand the principle of "individual interests being subordinate to revolutionary interests." This provides excuses for those who cannot adhere to the principle of "individual interests being subordinate to revolutionary interests." This is very dangerous for Party members. The development of this kind of thinking can cause a Party member to waver, compromise, or even leave the revolution. Some people could not withstand the test in the enemy's prisons, exposed the organization, and betrayed the revolution. Weren't they also using the excuse that "preserving one's life is to preserve strength for the revolution?!" when they were clearly greedy for life and afraid of death?

　　汪志鸿与耐冬的意见都会被妥协动摇者作为借口
    李盈、沈福悦
    我们认为这两种（汪志鸿与耐冬）看法都是不正确的，都是未能理解“个人利益服从革命利益”这一原则。这是给不能坚持“个人利益服从革命利益”原则的人找借口。这对党员来说是非常危险的。这种思想的发展能够使一个党员动摇、妥协甚至离开革命。有些人在敌人的监狱中经不起考验，暴露了组织，出卖了革命，明明是贪生怕死，不是也借口说“留着自己的生命是给革命保全实力吗？！”
