Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Shenyang and Tianjin have, during the spring plowing and sowing season, transferred unemployed or vagrant city residents to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.

　　The Shenyang Municipal People's Government, with the consent of the People's Governments of Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Jilin, and Liaodong provinces, has sent more than 3,300 vagrant residents from the city to the countryside. The above-mentioned four provinces accepting immigrants have prepared farmland, seeds, and housing for the immigrants in advance, and have sent special personnel to Shenyang to receive them. A group assigned to Jilin Province, in addition to some participating in forestry production or repairing dams, the rest have participated in spring plowing, collective farming. The Jilin Provincial People's Government issued seven months' worth of food and vegetable money to each person. Half of these immigrants were vagrants taken in by the city government last winter during social relief at the production and education center. After several months of labor reform, their enthusiasm for going to the countryside for production is very high, and they are determined to become laborers in the new society.

　　The Tianjin Municipal People's Government, based on the resolution of the city's Second People's Representative Conference on immigrating and reclaiming wasteland, has completed the first phase of immigration to Chahar Province. Three groups of immigrants, totaling 1,471 people, including unemployed or poor citizens and rickshaw pullers. The immigration travel expenses and production capital are provided or loaned by the government. Rickshaw puller Hong Zhigao sent a letter to the Tianjin Rickshaw Workers' Union after arriving in the countryside, saying: "After arriving in Kangbao County, 270 of us were assigned to more than 30 villages. The government staff are very concerned about us. My family of five was assigned to live in the Dalun Village and was allocated 28 mu of land (as much as the labor force can cultivate)."

　　沈阳天津两市移民下乡生产
    【新华社十七日讯】沈阳、天津两市在春耕播种期间，移送城市失业或无业游民下乡参加农业生产。
    沈阳市人民政府商得黑龙江、松江、吉林、辽东四省人民政府的同意，共已将该市无业游民三千三百余人送至乡下。上述四省接受移民地区，都早为移民备好耕地、种籽和住宅等，并曾各派专人到沈阳迎接。分配到吉林省的一批，除部分参加林业生产或修水坝外，其余均已参加春耕工作，集体种地。吉林省人民政府发给每人七个月的粮食和菜金。这些移民中半数是市府去冬举办社会救济时收容于生产教养院的游民。他们在经过几个月的劳动改造后，对下乡生产的情绪很高，都表示决心要成为新社会的劳动者。
    天津市人民政府根据该市第二届各界人民代表会议关于移民垦荒的决议，已完成——首次移民察哈尔省的工作。前后三批移民共一千四百七十一人，包括失业或贫苦市民和三轮车工人等。移民路费及生产资本均由政府供给或贷给。三轮车工人洪志高在到达乡下后寄信给天津市三轮车工会说：“到康保县后，我们二百七十人分配在三十几个村子里，政府办公人员对我们很关心。我家共五人，分配到大囫囵村居住，分得二十八亩地（按劳动力能耕作多少，就给多少）。”
