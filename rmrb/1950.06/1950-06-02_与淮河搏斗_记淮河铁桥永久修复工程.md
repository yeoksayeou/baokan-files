　　Fighting the Huai River
    ——A Record of the Permanent Repair Project of the Huai River Iron Bridge
    By our reporter Lü Guangming
    Half a kilometer north of Bengbu lies the turbulent Huai River and the Huai River Iron Bridge spanning it. On the Jinpu Railway, this bridge is second only to the Yellow River Iron Bridge at Luokou, north of Jinan. The bridge is 574 meters long and consists of nine 62.8-meter-span under-bearing flower beam structures. It was built in 1909 and has a long history of over forty years. As early as the spring of 1938, when the Japanese invaders invaded the Central Plains, the Kuomintang troops retreated without a fight, blowing up the Huai River and Mingguang Iron Bridges, and also breached the Yellow River embankment in the Zhongmu section. The massive influx of Yellow River floodwaters into the Huai River gradually raised the Huai River bed. This is the root cause of the Huai River's perennial floods and also caused great difficulties for the current permanent repair project of the Huai River Bridge. In January last year, when our army liberated Bengbu, war criminals Bai Chongxi and Liu Ruming once again destroyed the Huai River Iron Bridge. The permanent repair project of the Huai River Iron Bridge is the most arduous and massive among the bridge projects currently under construction nationwide, and the underwater engineering technology is the most complex. According to the on-site survey by Soviet expert Kingolink, the core issue in building the bridge is salvaging the steel beams and clearing the bridge pier foundations. The bridge engineering team accepted the guidance of advanced Soviet technology and successfully salvaged the fifth span, third span, seventh span, and half of the sixth span of the bridge by using the methods of "lowering wooden caissons, throwing rubble to build coffer dams" and "I-beam iron shoe top bridge".

    Difficulties arose when salvaging the fourth span beam. As a result of the underwater exploration by divers, it was discovered that a discarded steel beam, salvaged from a previous repair of the Huai Bridge by the Japanese invaders, lay just one meter away from the beam downstream. As a result, the riverbed slope was very steep, and the river was fourteen meters deep. It was impossible to lower wooden caissons or throw rubble. The salvage work was halted several times. At this time, the workers all started to use their brains and were determined to overcome this difficult obstacle to the project. Supervisor Gao Yufu and the hoisting workers studied it many times, and according to the principles of mechanics, precisely analyzed and configured the pulling force of each part of the pulley, using the power of the southern end of the repaired third span steel beam to lift the bridge out of the water. Then, wooden caissons were lowered in the middle of the bridge span to build coffer dams to level it. However, during the lifting process, they encountered spring floods that had not been seen in more than twenty years. The part of the fourth span beam that had been exposed was submerged again. In addition, the water was too strong, and the pulleys were difficult to fasten. The workers once again demonstrated collective wisdom and created the scientific method of "needle threading with buoys". In the rapids, a hemp rope with a rubber tube套好了 was tied to a wooden board, and then a bamboo pole was used to push the wooden block from upstream, using the power of the water to bring the wooden block over the upper chord of the steel beam, and then the hemp rope pulling the steel wire rope was released, and the wooden block floated to the surface. This was repeated until the pulleys were fastened. However, when lifting, the previously fastened pulleys malfunctioned due to the impact of the flood. Comrades Wang Yuwu, Yu Donghai, Li Jiquan, and Xu Qingchang, risking their lives, went into the icy rapids of the late winter ten times in a row and finally straightened the steel wire rope that had come out of the wheel groove and bitten the wheel rim. The fourth span flower beam was finally salvaged.

    Half of the fourth span flower beam had been destroyed by the bandit troops, and the other half was entirely single steel materials that had been re-configured. Supervisor Gao Yufu came up with the method of "air beam alignment,"拼对 the ends of the lower chord trunks on both sides of the bridge with half of the whole flower beam; the other end was tied to the coffer dam built on the head of the third span beam. The heroic hoisting workers climbed on the straight and diagonal材材 six or seven丈丈 high from the water surface, working selflessly for the new Chinese people's railway. After eleven and a half days of intense struggle, the "air alignment" work of the fourth span flower beam was finally successfully completed on May 9.

　　与淮河搏斗
    ——记淮河铁桥永久修复工程
    本报记者  吕光明
    从蚌埠北行半公里，就是汹涌湍急的淮河和横跨河上的淮河铁桥。在津浦线上，这座桥仅次于济南北面洛口的黄河大铁桥。该桥全长五百七十四公尺，由九孔六二·八公尺的下承花梁组成。该桥修建于一九○九年，迄今已有四十余年的悠久历史。早在一九三八年春，日寇进犯中原时，国民党军队不战而退，除将淮河、明光两铁桥炸毁外，更在中牟段决开黄河堤。黄河洪水大量入淮，淮河河床逐渐淤高。这便是淮河历年泛滥成灾的根由，也给现在淮河大桥永久修复工程造成巨大的困难。去年一月间，当我军解放蚌埠时，战犯白崇禧、刘汝明又将淮河铁桥再次炸毁。淮河铁桥的永久修复工程，在目前全国已动工的桥梁工程中，最为艰巨浩大，水下工程技术最为复杂。据苏联专家金果林克到现场勘察的结果，认为修建该桥的中心问题，是打捞钢梁与清理桥墩基础。桥梁工程队接受了苏联专家先进技术的指导，采用“下木沈箱、抛片石打道木垛”和“工字梁铁鞋顶桥”的方法，顺利地打捞起该桥第五孔、第三孔、第七孔及第六孔的半个花梁。
    困难发生在打捞第四孔梁时，经潜水工人探摸的结果，发现紧靠该梁一公尺远的下游，躺着日寇第一次修复淮桥时捞起的一孔废钢梁。因此，河底坡度很大，河水深达十四公尺。不但无法下木沉箱，也无法投片石。打捞工作因而停顿数次。这时，工人们一齐开动了脑筋，决心克服这一个障碍工程进行的困难。监工员高玉福和起重工人们研究了许多次，根据力学原理，精密地分析配置了各部滑车的拉力，利用已修好的第三孔钢梁南端的力量，将该桥吊出水面。再在桥孔中间下木沉箱，打道木垛顶平。但在起吊过程中，又遭遇到二十余年来未曾有过的春季洪水，第四孔梁露出水面的部分，这时又被淹没，加以水势太猛，滑车很难拴系。工人们又发扬了集体智慧，创造出“浮标穿针”的科学方法。在急流中，用套好胶皮管的麻绳，拴上一块木板，再用一竹竿从上游将木块顶下去，利用水流的力量，把木块带过钢梁的上弦材，然后把牵引钢丝绳的麻绳松下去，木块便飘上水面。如此周而复始，慢慢地把滑车拴好了。但起吊时，以前拴好的滑车，因受洪水冲击，又发生了故障。工友王玉武、于东海、李继泉、许庆昌四人，冒着生命的危险，在冬末的严寒急流中，连续下水十次，终于把脱出轮槽咬住轮沿的钢丝绳拨顺。第四孔花梁始被打捞上来。
    第四孔花梁原被匪军炸毁一半，另一半完全是重新配制的单根钢材。监工员高玉福想出了“空中对梁”的办法，把桥两侧下弦干的一端和半个整体花梁拼对好；另一端系拴在第三孔梁头搭起的道木垛上。英勇的起重工人们，攀爬在距水面六、七丈高的直、斜材上，为新中国人民铁道忘我的工作着。经过十一天半的紧张奋斗，第四孔花梁的“空中拼对”工作，终于五月九日胜利完成。
