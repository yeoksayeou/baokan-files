The Fire at Huangsongling
Su Jian (drawing), Ma Xun (poem)
(Sixteen)
    The special agent set the fire! Who to call? No one can hear.
    The special agent set the fire! Who to call out to? Everyone is far away from here!
    Yan Guaitou (Old Devil Yan) finally fulfills his long-cherished wish!
    The fire in the weeds is rising! It jumped over the firebreak!

(Seventeen)
    The station chief finished writing his report, thinking all was well!
    Suddenly, a whiff of smoke, reached his nose:
    --What's that? He stood on the windowsill and looked out:
    "Oh! Fire! Fire!" He was greatly alarmed, shouted loudly, and jumped out of the window to run!

(Eighteen)
    The station chief ran to the lumberyard, the flames were burning toward the stacks of wood!
    Yan Guaitou was about to run away, when the station chief grabbed him!
    Yan Guaitou raised a large wooden club, and knocked the station chief down with one blow!
    Yan Guaitou laughed loudly. The station chief fell into his trap.
    The arson plan is complete, and he has one last move left, -- run!

(Nineteen)
    The station chief woke up from his daze, the fire on the woodpile was raging!
    Black smoke billowed upward, as if scorching his heart!
    He fainted again! The fire is getting bigger and bigger...

    “黄松岭的火灾”
    苏坚画  马寻诗（十六）特务放火了！喊谁？谁也听不见；特务放火了！叫谁？谁都离这老远！阎怪头终于完成他的宿愿！荒草的火呀，起来了！扑过了防火道！
    （十七）所长写完了报告，以为天下太平了！忽然一股烟气味，被他鼻子闻到：——什么？站到窓台向外瞧：“咳呀！火！火呀！”大吃一惊，高声叫，跳出窓子向外跑！
    （十八）所长跑到楞场，火焰正向木垛上烧！阎怪头刚要跑掉，被所长一把抓牢！阎怪头举起大木棍，一下子把所长揍倒！阎怪头哈哈大笑。所长上了他的圈套。放火计划完成了，还有他最后的一着，——跑！
    （十九）所长从昏迷中苏醒，木垛上火势正凶！黑烟滚滚向上冲，像烧焦了他的心胸！他又昏迷的倒下！火呀，越来越大……
