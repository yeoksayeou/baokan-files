　　Henan Wheat Mostly Harvested Successfully
    Actively Organize Mutual Aid to Ensure Both Wheat Harvesting and Summer Planting are Carried Out Simultaneously
    [Report from this newspaper] Reports from our correspondents: Farmers in various parts of Henan Province are actively harvesting wheat and rushing to plant late autumn crops. Over two million mu of barley in the Xuchang Special District has been completely harvested and wheat harvesting is now underway. In the Huangchuan Special District, after half a month of efforts by more than two million farmers, barley and wheat have been completely harvested from over 3,387,000 mu of wheat fields. The summer harvest in the Chenliu Special District is nearing completion. Farmers in the Shanzhou, Xinyang, Nanyang, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Shangqiu, and Huaiyang Special Districts have all been swept up in the wheat harvesting fervor. Thanks to favorable weather and diligent fertilization and weeding of wheat seedlings this spring, most areas have reported bumper harvests, except for some areas that suffered from wind, hail, and other disasters. In Qi County's Yuzhen and Gegang districts, barley yielded only one dou per mu last year, but this year the average yield is three dou per mu. Sandy land in Lanfeng yielded only ten to forty jin per mu last year, but this year it has yielded one hundred to one hundred and fifty jin. Farmers everywhere are beaming with joy, and their enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high. Before the wheat harvest, in order to ensure order, all localities widely publicized the policy of "whoever sows, reaps; protect the fruits of labor," and organized the masses to protect the wheat with rural militia and peasant associations as the backbone, implementing the wheat harvesting regulations set by people's representative conferences at the district and village peasant representative conferences, ensuring good order during the wheat harvest. During the wheat harvest, all localities actively organized mutual aid for manpower and livestock to ensure "quick harvesting and planting through organization, without losing a single grain of wheat or leaving an inch of land uncultivated." In Xihua County alone, more than 4,300 mutual aid groups were organized, with more than 74,000 people participating. In Xue Dian Township, Jia County, the Zeng Genyu mutual aid group, with seven male laborers, seven female laborers, and three children, except for one woman who stayed behind to cook and feed the livestock, all went all out to harvest wheat. In Shizhuang Village, Weishi County, the entire village formed eleven mutual aid wheat harvesting groups. For families of revolutionary martyrs, disabled soldiers, workers, and those who are elderly, widowed, or lack labor, local people's governments and peasant associations mobilized farmers to cultivate on their behalf or provided assistance in other ways. In counties such as Xiangcheng and Jia County, the wheat of families of revolutionary martyrs, disabled soldiers, and workers was fixed to be harvested by代耕 mutual aid groups. During the wheat harvest, large numbers of women went to the fields. According to statistics from Yunsuo Township in Qi County, out of more than 1,900 women in the township, 1,724 participated in the wheat harvest. Various special and county-level government offices, schools, and stationed troops also enthusiastically participated in assisting the harvest. More than 1,100 people from various directly subordinate departments in the Chenliu Special District systematically helped families of revolutionary martyrs, disabled soldiers, and impoverished farmers who lacked labor harvest over 1,000 mu of wheat in 66 villages from June 1st to 3rd. Li Taoting, Secretary of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, personally led 27 staff members from the government office to participate in assisting the harvest on the afternoon of May 31st, harvesting more than seven mu of wheat in two hours. The government of Wutou District in Xin'an County, except for one person who stayed to maintain operations, all went to the countryside to assist the harvest. Personnel from various government offices, troops, and organizations who participated in assisting the harvest conscientiously implemented the discipline of assisting the harvest and were warmly welcomed by the local farmers. Combining the wheat harvest, many areas carried out the sowing of late autumn crops and rice transplanting, achieving both transplanting and harvesting without delay. As of the 3rd of this month, 650,000 mu of the county's 800,000 mu of wheat land in Qi County had been planted with millet, sweet potatoes, mung beans, and other crops. The Huangchuan Special District put forward the slogan of "harvest wheat, plow the fields, and transplant rice seedlings at the same time" during the wheat harvest, and more than 4 million mu of rice paddies have been transplanted, accounting for one-half of the 8,520,000 mu of paddy fields in the entire special district.

　　河南小麦大部丰收
    积极组织互助做到割麦夏种两不误
    【本报讯】综合通讯员报道：河南省各地农民正积极收麦和抢种晚秋。许昌专区二百余万亩大麦已全部登场，现正赶收小麦。潢川专区三百三十八万七千余亩麦田，经二百余万农民半月来的努力，大麦、小麦已全部收完。陈留专区夏收已近尾声。陕州、信阳、南阳、郑州、洛阳、商邱、淮阳等专区，农民均已卷入麦收热潮。由于今春风调雨顺和农民积极加工施肥，普锄麦苗，除个别地区麦子受风雹等灾外，大部均告丰收。杞县于镇、葛岗区去年大麦每亩只收一斗，今年平均每亩收三斗。兰封沙地去年每亩只收十至四十斤，今年收到一百斤至一百五十斤。各地农民喜形于色，生产情绪空前高涨。麦收前，为了确保麦收秩序，各地普遍宣传了“谁种谁收、保护劳动所得”的政策，并以乡村民兵、农会为骨干组织群众护麦，执行了各界人民代表会，区、村农民代表会所定的麦收纪律，保障了麦收的良好秩序。在麦收中，各地纷纷组织人畜力互助，保证了“组织起来快收快种，不丢一穗麦不荒一分田”。仅西华县就组织了四千三百余个互助组，有七万四千多人参加。郏县薛店乡曾根玉互助组，七个男劳动力、七个女劳动力、三个儿童，除留下一个妇女做饭喂牲口外，全部突击收麦。尉氏县史庄村全村组成了十一个互助收麦组。对烈军工属及孤寡无劳力户，由当地人民政府、农民协会动员农民代耕，或用其他方式予以帮助。襄城、郏县等县烈、军、工属的麦子则固定由代耕互助组帮助收割。麦收中大批妇女纷纷下地，据杞县云所乡一个乡统计，全乡妇女一千九百余人，参加收麦者即达一千七百二十四人。各专、县机关、学校及驻军，亦踊跃参加助收工作。陈留专区各直属机关一千一百余人，自六月一日至三日有计划的帮助六十六个村的无劳动力的烈军工属与贫苦农民收麦千余亩。中共许昌地委书记李陶庭于五月三十一日下午亲率机关工作人员二十七人参加助收，两小时即收麦七亩多。新安县五头区政府，除留一人坚持工作外，全部下乡助收。各机关、部队、团体参加助收的人员，均认真的执行了助收纪律，受到了当地农民的热烈拥护。结合麦收，不少地区进行了播种晚秋和插秧工作，做到了插秧、割麦两不误。杞县至本月三日为止，全县八十余万亩麦地，已有六十五万余亩种上谷子、红薯、绿豆等作物。潢川专区在收麦中提出“随割麦、随翻田、随插秧”的口号，秧田已插好四百余万亩，占全专区八百五十二万余亩水田的二分之一。（长江日报、赵洪亮、英林、绍曾）
