　　Why Is Zong Desheng's Land Not Being Returned?
　　Request That Dong'e County Government Investigate and Handle This.

　　Editor:

　　I am a resident of No. 29, Shiqiao Hutong, Dongsi 7th Alley. My family has six small rooms and a well. I usually make a living by pushing a cart and selling clean water. With the little money I saved from years of hard work, I bought nine and a half mu of land in Zhouzhuang, Third District, Dong'e County, Pingyuan Province, my hometown. Because I live in Beijing, I entrusted the land to my mother-in-law's family to take care of it. My mother-in-law's family is of poor peasant background. During the land redistribution two years ago, my mother-in-law, not understanding the policies and fearing struggle, offered my land. Now, there are not many families buying well water here, and my family's life is difficult to sustain, so I want to go back home to farm. But when I got home, I found that the land had already been distributed. According to my mother-in-law, the local government told her at the time: "This land will be returned to him when he comes back." So I requested the local government to resolve this issue for me. But the local government has not given me a sincere answer. I am now very distressed and anxious, and I don't know what to do. Can the local government solve my current difficult problem? Please give me an answer, Editor.

　　Editor's Note: If the situation reflected by Zong Desheng is true, then his land rights to the nine and a half mu of land should be protected. The land was not offered by him personally at the time, and the local government also believed that the land should be returned to him when he returned home. Since this is the case, we hope that the Dong'e County Government will investigate and handle this matter and give us a reply.

　　宗德升的土地为何不归还？
    望东阿县政府调查处理编者先生：
    我是东四七条里石桥胡同二十九号住户。家中有六间小房，一口水井。我平时靠推卖清水维持生活。我并利用几年中辛勤劳动所积下的一点钱，在老家平原省东阿县三区周庄买下九亩半地。因我住在北京城里，就把地托我岳母家照管。岳母家是个贫农成份。前年分土地时，岳母不懂政策，怕斗争，就把我的地献出去了。现在这里买井水的人家不多了，我家生活就难维持，所以想回家去种地。可是回家一看，地已经被分了。据岳母说，那时候当地政府对她说：“这地等本人回来时仍然交给他。”这样我便请求当地政府给我解决这问题。可是当地政府总没有恳切的答复。我现在很为苦闷着急，不知如何办理。当地政府是否能够给我解决目前的困难问题？请编者先生给我一个解答。
          宗德升
    编者按：宗德升所反映的情况如果属实，则他的九亩半地的地权应受保护。当时献地的既不是他本人，而当地政府亦认为他本人回家时应将土地还给他。既然如此我们就希望东阿县政府调查处理，并给我们一个答复。
