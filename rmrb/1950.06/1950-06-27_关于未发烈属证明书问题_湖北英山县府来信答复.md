To the Editorial Staff:

　　After reading Comrade Chen Guoliang's complaint in the People's Forum on June 2nd regarding the county government's failure to issue certificates for families of martyrs, we have conducted a sincere review and offer the following response:

　　Comrade Chen Guoliang worked at the Shucheng Post Office last year. During the army's crossing of the river, for some reason, he was detained by the People's Liberation Army. At that time, the family of Martyr Chen Weidong requested the county government to issue an official letter proving that he was a descendant of a martyr. We complied, and he was released and returned home.

　　Our county's civil affairs work was only staffed in January and began to be established. In order to register military and industrial martyr families and handle preferential treatment work, each district hired each family to establish a "Preferential Assessment Committee." Comrade Weidong's name was officially entered into the register of martyrs. And in accordance with the preferential treatment measures promulgated by Hubei Province, each family was given a certain amount of assistance in their living. The Weidong martyr's family is of middle peasant composition. After evaluation by the local "Preferential Assessment Committee," they were issued 20 catties of rice for the first batch of spring preferential grain. Our county's local grain has been used up, so the second batch of preferential grain cannot be issued.

　　The martyr family certificates were only received at the end of January this year, so they were not issued in December 1949. Since the beginning of spring, county and district government staff have been busy with mass work on rent reduction and famine relief, and not a single martyr family certificate has been issued throughout the county. There is no other intention. In order to commend the glory of military and industrial martyrs, the county government made and distributed honor boards. Other districts have successively delivered them to the homes of military and industrial martyrs in the spring. However, the district government of the district where Martyr Chen Weidong's family is located failed to supervise effectively, and it has only now delivered them to each family. Now the family of Martyr Weidong has also been given an honor board. We review: the martyr certificate received in January has not been issued to date. This is a manifestation of bureaucratism. At the same time, our consolation to the families of martyrs has not been done well enough in general. We must improve our work in all aspects in the future. However, because the county's autumn grain levy still owes more than 900,000 catties, the second batch of preferential grain cannot be issued temporarily.
Hubei Yingshan County People's Government

Editor's Note: The Yingshan County government's letter explained the reasons for the failure to issue martyr family certificates and made a self-criticism, but still did not explain when the martyr family certificates will be issued. We ask the Yingshan County government to urge the districts to issue these certificates as soon as possible. As for the issue of the second batch of preferential grain, the special commissioner's office should be consulted and reported to the provincial government for unified resolution.

### 关于未发烈属证明书问题  湖北英山县府来信答复

　　关于未发烈属证明书问题  湖北英山县府来信答复编辑同志：
    看到人民园地六月二日刊登陈国梁同志申诉县府不发给烈属证明书的问题，我们万分诚恳地进行了检讨，并答复于后：
    陈国梁同志去年在舒城邮局工作。大军渡江时，不知道为了什么，他被解放军扣押。当时陈卫东烈士家属要求县府去公函证明他是烈属子弟。我们照办了，他被释放回家。
    我县民政工作在一月份才配备干部，开始建立。为登记军工烈属办理优待工作，各区聘请各家属成立“优评会”。卫东同志的名字正式写入烈士册。并遵照湖北省所颁发的优待办法，给予各家属生活上一定的帮助。卫东烈属系中农成份，经当地“优评会”评议，发给他第一批春季优属粮大米二十斤。我县地方粮已经用完，故二批优属粮无法发给。
    烈属证明书在今年一月底才领来，故在一九四九年十二月没有发给。入春以来，县、区政府工作人员因忙于减租度荒的群众工作，全县烈属证明书一张未发。此外毫无别的用意。为表扬烈军工属的光荣，由县府制赠光荣牌。其他各区在春季均先后送达烈军工属之家。但陈卫东烈士家属所在的那一区的区政府因督促不力，现在才分别送达各家属。现在卫东烈士家属已同样挂上了光荣牌。我们检讨：一月领下的烈属证，至今未发出。这是一种官僚主义的表现。同时我们对烈属的安慰，普遍做得不够。我们今后一定要改进我们各方面的工作。但因本县秋征的地方粮，尚有尾欠九十余万斤未收齐，故第二批优属粮暂时不能发给。
          湖北英山县人民政府
    编者按：英山县政府来信解释了未发烈属证明书的原因，并做了自我检讨，但仍未说明烈属证明书何时发出。我们要求英山县政府督促各区赶快将此证明书发下。至于第二批优属粮的问题，亦应请示专署并报省府统一解决。
