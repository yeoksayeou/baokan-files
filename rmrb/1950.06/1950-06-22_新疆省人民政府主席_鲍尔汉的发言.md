　　Speech by Burhan (Uyghur), Chairman of the People's Government of Xinjiang Province

　　(Xinhua News Agency, 21st) Burhan (Uyghur), Chairman of the People's Government of the Xinjiang Province, gave a speech at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC on the 21st. The full text of his speech is as follows:

　　Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Members, Comrades:

　　First, allow me to extend my highest respect and sincere greetings to the conference on behalf of the 5.3 million people of all thirteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang!

　　At this conference, we heard Chairman Mao's opening address, Vice-Chairman Liu's report on the land reform issue, Premier Zhou's political report, and reports from other responsible comrades of the Central People's Government on military, financial, economic, cultural, educational, and judicial work. From these reports, we can clearly see that in the short eight months since our country shook off imperialist aggression and overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese Communist Party, we have achieved many accomplishments, consolidated the foundation of our country, raised our international status, and strengthened the world's peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union. These facts make the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang feel extremely excited and infinitely honored!

　　For a long time, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang suffered cruel oppression, deception, and trampling by the reactionary ruling class. Furthermore, due to the reactionary ruling class's instigation and imperialist conspiracies, our people were fooled, killed each other, and harbored hatred. Therefore, in the past, Xinjiang was a prison filled with bloody ethnic feuds and ethnic oppression!

　　However, this situation has changed due to the victory of the great Chinese People's Revolution. From now on, this kind of ethnic oppression and feuds will never return. The new ethnic relationship that replaces this situation is one of unity, mutual assistance, friendship, and cooperation between all ethnic groups.

　　In the past, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang launched many heroic struggles for liberation in order to get rid of all kinds of oppression by imperialism and the reactionary ruling class. However, due to the lack of correct leadership and strong organization at the time, each struggle was suppressed by the reactionary ruling class. It was not until the revolutionary movement that broke out in Yili in 1944 achieved victory in the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Altay that a revolutionary force against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was formed. This force, together with the democratic forces of the seven districts, coordinated with the national people's liberation cause. With the decisive and glorious victory of the People's Liberation Army throughout the country, Xinjiang's revolutionary forces converged with the revolutionary torrents of the whole country, thus liberating the province.

　　Based on the experience gained from many struggles in the past, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang deeply understand that only this liberation is the real and thorough liberation, and that this liberation can only be realized, consolidated, and developed with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the help of the People's Liberation Army.

　　Secondly, regarding the central topic of this conference, the "land reform" issue, we believe that this is not only a fundamental issue for liberating farmers, but also one of the basic factors for solving ethnic issues.

　　As for when to implement land reform in Xinjiang, Vice-Chairman Liu Shaoqi said in his report on the land reform issue: "This will depend on the working conditions within the various minority nationalities and the degree of awareness of the masses before a decision can be made." This is a concrete manifestation of conforming to the interests of the minority people and taking care of the special circumstances of the minority nationalities. We, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, express our warm support for the new Land Reform Law and create conditions for the implementation of land reform in Xinjiang.

　　Two months ago, when the people of Xinjiang heard the news that China and the Soviet Union had signed agreements to establish two major companies for the exploitation of oil and non-ferrous metals and a trade agreement in Xinjiang, they were as jubilant as if they were celebrating a festival. This is because the establishment of these two major companies will not only play a significant role in developing the province's economy and culture and improving the people's living standards, but will also inevitably play a major role in making Xinjiang a heavy industrial region of China. On this point, the 5.3 million people of the province's thirteen ethnic groups express their sincere gratitude to the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, and our ally, Marshal Stalin of the Soviet Union!

　　Furthermore, the people of Xinjiang request that the Central People's Government take effective measures to deal with the consulates of the United States and other imperialist countries in Xinjiang, because they have always supported the Kuomintang reactionaries who oppressed us, hindered the friendship between the people of Xinjiang and the people of our ally, the Soviet Union, and openly interfered in the province's internal affairs, fostered and instigated bandits to disrupt the peaceful life of the people of the province. For example, Mr. Macklin, the former U.S. Deputy Consul in Dihua, gave financial assistance to bandits Usman, Janimkhan, etc. in September last year, and encouraged these bandits and the White Russians with them, instigating them to openly armed rebellion against our People's Government, causing great damage to people's lives.

　　Premier Zhou mentioned in his political report that the Central Government is preparing to organize a visiting delegation to visit the Northwest to solicit the opinions of local minority nationalities. We believe that the Central Government's organization of a visiting delegation to work in the Northwest is of great political significance and will certainly strengthen the unity and understanding between the Central Government and the minority nationalities in the Northwest. Here, we would like to express our warm welcome on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

　　Our people in Xinjiang resolutely implement the ethnic unity and ethnic equality policy stipulated in the Common Program. We firmly believe that the ethnic issues in China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and under the guidance of the correct ethnic policy of the Common Program, will surely be thoroughly and perfectly resolved! We guarantee that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will, with the spirit of internationalism, closely unite with all ethnic groups and classes of people in China around the Central People's Government, the Chinese Communist Party, and the people's leader, Chairman Mao, and strive to resolutely implement all their calls, to build an independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous new China. To make ourselves outstanding and progressive members of the great family of fraternal cooperation of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China!

　　The 5.3 million people of Xinjiang's thirteen ethnic groups cherish the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the wise leader of the people, Chairman Mao, with the same enthusiasm as they cherish their own eyes.

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the fraternal friendship and unity of all ethnic groups within China!

　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live the wise people's leader, Chairman Mao!

　　Long live the success of the National Committee of the CPPCC!

　　新疆省人民政府主席
    鲍尔汉的发言
    【新华社二十一日讯】新疆省人民政府主席鲍尔汉（维族）二十一日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，其发言全文如下：主席、副主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    首先让我代表新疆十三个民族的五百三十万人民向大会致以崇高的敬意与热诚的慰问！
    这一次大会，我们听到了毛主席的开幕词，刘副主席关于土改问题的报告，周总理的政治报告和中央人民政府其他各负责同志关于军事、财经、文教、法院工作等问题的报告。从这些报告当中，使我们明显的看出了我们的国家在摆脱帝国主义侵略和推翻国民党反动统治以后的短短八个月中，由于中央人民政府毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导，获得了很多的成就，巩固了我们国家的基础，提高了我们的国际地位，加强了全世界以苏联为首的和平民主阵营。这些事实，使得我们新疆各族人民感到异常的兴奋和无上的光荣！
    很久以来，我们新疆各民族受尽了反动统治阶级的惨酷压迫，欺骗蹂躏，更由于反动统治阶级的挑拨离间，帝国主义的阴谋破坏，使我们各族人民受了愚弄，互相残杀，结成仇恨。所以过去的新疆是充满了血泪的民族仇杀与民族压迫的牢狱！
    但是，这种情况，由于中国人民大革命的胜利而改变了，从今以后，这种民族间的压迫和仇杀是一去不复返了，代替这种情况的新的民族关系，乃是各民族之间的团结互助与友爱合作。
    在过去，新疆的各族人民为了摆脱帝国主义与反动统治阶级的各种压迫，曾爆发了许多次英勇的解放斗争，但由于当时的没有正确领导，没有坚强组织，每次斗争都被反动统治阶级镇压下去了，直到一九四四年在伊犁爆发的革命运动在伊、塔、阿三区取得了胜利，才形成了一支反对国民党反动统治的革命力量，这个力量和七区人民的民主力量汇合在一起，配合了全国人民的解放事业，在人民解放军在全国范围内具有决定性的光辉胜利之下，新疆的革命力量与全国的革命洪流相汇合，遂使本省获得了解放。
    新疆的各族人民，根据他们从过去许多次斗争中所获得的经验，使他们深深知道：只有这一次的解放，才是真正的、彻底的解放，并且这种解放，也只有在中国共产党的领导下及人民解放军的帮助下，才有可能实现，巩固并发展这种革命的果实。
    其次，对于这次大会的中心议题“土改”问题，我们认为这不仅是解放农民的基本问题，并且也是解决民族问题的基本因素之一。
    至于在新疆什么时候实行土改，刘少奇副主席在土改问题报告中说：“这要看各少数民族内部的工作情况与群众的觉悟程度如何，才能决定。”这更是符合少数民族人民大众利益与照顾少数民族特殊情况的具体表现，我们代表新疆各族人民对于新的土地改革法表示热烈的拥护，并为新疆的实行土改创造条件。
    在两个月以前，当新疆人民听到中苏两国签订在新疆创设开采石油和有色金属的两大公司与贸易协定的消息时，如同过节一样的欢欣鼓舞，这就是因为这两大公司的创设，不仅是在发展本省经济、文化和提高人民生活水准方面要起很大的作用，并且在使新疆成为中国的重工业区方面，也必然要起重大的作用。对于这一点，本省十三个民族五百三十万人民谨向中央人民政府毛主席和盟邦苏联斯大林大元帅表示诚挚的谢忱！
    再次，新疆人民要求中央人民政府采取有效措施对付美国等帝国主义在新疆的领事馆，因为他们一向扶助压迫我们的国民党反动派，妨害新疆人民与我们盟邦苏联人民之间的友谊，并公开干涉本省的内政，扶植并嗾使土匪破坏本省人民的和平生活，例如：美帝前驻迪化副领事马克南即曾于去年九月间给予土匪乌斯满，贾尼木汗等以金钱援助，并鼓励这些匪徒及与他们在一起的白俄，嗾使他们公开武装叛变，反抗我人民政府，使人民生活受到极大损害。
    周总理在政治报告中，曾提到中央准备组织访问团访问西北，征询当地少数民族的意见，我们认为中央组织访问团前往西北工作，是具有重大的政治意义的，一定会加强中央与西北各少数民族之间的团结与了解，我们在这里谨代表新疆各族人民表示热烈的欢迎。
    我们新疆人民坚决的执行共同纲领中所规定的民族团结，民族平等的民族政策，我们深深相信，中国的民族问题，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下、在共同纲领正确的民族政策的指导下，一定能够获得彻底完满的解决！我们保证新疆各族人民绝以国际主义的精神和全中国的各族，各阶级人民一起紧密的团结在中央人民政府及中国共产党，人民领袖毛主席的周围，为坚决执行它们的一切号召，为建设独立、自由、民主统一和富强的新中国而奋斗。为使自己成为中华人民共和国各民族友爱合作大家庭中的优秀进步成员而奋斗！
    新疆十三个民族五百三十万人民以爱护自己眼睛一般的热诚爱戴中国共产党，中央人民政府和人民的贤明领袖毛主席。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国境内各民族兄弟般的友爱团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    贤明的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    人民政协全国委员会大会的成功万岁！
