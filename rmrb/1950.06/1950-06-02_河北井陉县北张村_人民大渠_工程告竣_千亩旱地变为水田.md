    "People's Grand Canal" Project Completed
    Thousands of Mu of Dry Land Transformed into Paddy Fields
    [Our Newspaper, Jingxing News] The "People's Grand Canal" project in North Zhang Village, Jingxing County, Hebei Province, has been completed, transforming thousands of mu of dry land into paddy fields. Although the village is close to the Ye River, it could not irrigate the land due to the lack of canals (out of more than 3,300 mu of land in the village, only 186 mu were irrigated). After the land reform, the masses urgently hoped to turn dry land into paddy fields. Due to the massive scale of the project, the village was small and lacked strength, coupled with the lack of specific organization and leadership, the construction of the canal was repeatedly delayed. The completion of the nearby Weishui "Democracy Grand Canal" last year greatly influenced the village's determination to excavate a canal. In early October last year, village chief Wang Qianlin and Farmers' Association Director Wang Furui, seeing the urgent demands of the masses, successively convened cadre meetings and mass meetings calling for the canal's construction, which was supported by the entire village. Subsequently, a water conservancy management committee was established to actively raise funds. The county's supply and marketing cooperative, in order to assist the village in completing the canal project, lent 25,000 jin of rice and sent water conservancy professional cadres to assist in surveying, planning, and leadership. After the preparations were completed, construction officially began in late October last year. The masses were in high spirits, with more than 150 people working every day (each work unit was calculated at six jin of rice, and after the work was completed, work was assessed according to land acreage to even out the grain). In February of this year, in order to take care of the difficult lives of poor farmers and to complete the project early, wages were raised to eight jin of rice. The number of people working every day increased to 250. The commissioner's office also sent personnel to help and lent another 28,000 jin of millet. At the same time, the canal was named the "People's Grand Canal." Thanks to the strong leadership of governments and cadres at all levels and the active excavation by the peasants, the 5,000-meter-long "People's Grand Canal" project was fully completed by May 9, and water began to be released for irrigation, thereby transforming more than 1,000 mu of barren dry land in the village into fertile paddy fields.

　　河北井陉县北张村
    “人民大渠”工程告竣
    千亩旱地变为水田
    【本报井陉讯】河北省井陉县北张村“人民大渠”工程告竣，使千亩旱地变为水田。该村虽紧靠冶河，因无水渠而不能浇地（全村三千三百多亩土地中，只有水浇地一百八十六亩），土地改革后，群众迫切希望把旱地变成水田，由于工程浩大，村小力薄，再加无人具体组织领导，使开筑工程一再延迟。去年附近微水“民主大渠”完成后，给该村决心开挖渠道以极大影响。去年十月初，该村村长王谦林、农会主任王福瑞见群众要求迫切，即先后召开了干部会与群众会号召开渠，得到了全村群众的拥护。接着成立了水利管理委员会，积极筹备经费；该县供销社为扶助该村完成开渠工程，先后贷米二万五千斤，又派水利专业干部帮助测量计划与领导。准备工作完成后，于去年十月下旬正式开工。群众情绪极高，每天上工的达一百五十多人（每工以六斤米算，工竣后按地亩评工齐粮）。至今年二月间，为照顾贫苦农民生活困难，使工程提早完成，即将工资提高到八斤米。每天上工人数增到二百五十名。专署亦派员帮助，并又贷给小米两万八千斤。同时将该渠命名为“人民大渠”。由于各级政府与干部的大力领导和农民的积极开掘，至五月九日，长达五千公尺的“人民大渠”工程即全部完成，并开始放水浇地，从而使该村一千余亩贫瘠的旱地变为肥沃的水田。（王靖）
