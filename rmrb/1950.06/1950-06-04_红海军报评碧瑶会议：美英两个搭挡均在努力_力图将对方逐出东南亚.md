　　Red Navy Paper Comments on Baguio Conference:
    Both US and British Partners are Striving to Oust Each Other from Southeast Asia
    [Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] TASS Moscow dispatch: A Red Navy Paper observer commented on the results of the Baguio Conference on the 2nd, stating: The communique issued after the Baguio Conference only touched upon economic issues. However, this does not mean that the issue is limited to seeking ways and means to intensify American economic infiltration into Southeast Asian countries. The issue also involves political measures, namely, establishing organizations that constitute the core of a Pacific Pact.
    However, this plan encountered serious difficulties. According to Reuters, the plan to establish such an organization was shelved by representatives from India, Pakistan, and Ceylon. No matter how subservient these countries' ruling groups are to American imperialism, they do not dare to establish such a political organization because they consider that the policy of openly organizing a group aimed at opposing progressive forces in Southeast Asia is not supported by the broad masses of the people.
    The observer pointed out: The Baguio Conference and the British Commonwealth Sydney Conference revealed that the contradictions between the US-British bloc in the Far East continue to intensify. Both the US and British partners are striving to oust their opponents to consolidate their own positions. The British ruling group attempted to use the Sydney Conference to counter American infiltration into Southeast Asian countries. The Baguio Conference was conducted under American pressure on Pacific countries, especially British dominions.

### 红海军报评碧瑶会议：美英两个搭挡均在努力  力图将对方逐出东南亚

　　红海军报评碧瑶会议：
    美英两个搭挡均在努力  力图将对方逐出东南亚
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：红海军报观察家于二日评论碧瑶会议的结果称：碧瑶会议结束后发表的公报仅仅谈到经济问题。不过，这丝毫不意味着问题只限于寻求加紧美国经济渗入东南亚各国的方式及方法，问题也涉及政治的措施，即设立构成太平洋公约核心的组织。
    但是，这个计划遭到严重的困难。据路透社的消息称：建立这种组织的计划被印度、巴基斯坦及锡兰的代表所搁置了。无论它们怎样向美帝国主义者卑躬屈节，这些国家的统治集团并不敢建立这种政治组织，因为他们考虑到公开组织以反对东南亚进步力量为目的的集团这一政策，是不为广大的人民群众所拥护的。
    观察家指出：碧瑶会议及英联邦悉尼会议透露：美英集团在远东方面的矛盾，继续在尖锐化。美英这两个搭挡，每一个都竭力想逐出其对手，以巩固自己的地位。英国统治集团企图利用悉尼会议来反击美国的渗入东南亚国家。而碧瑶会议则是在美国对太平洋国家特别是对英国自治领的压力之下进行的。
