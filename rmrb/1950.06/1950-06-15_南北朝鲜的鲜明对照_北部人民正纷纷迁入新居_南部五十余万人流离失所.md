    [Xinhua News Agency, 14th] Under the leadership of the People's Republic government, the people of North Korea are moving into new homes, while the people of South Korea, under the cruel rule of the US-Korean reactionaries, are increasingly being displaced. According to a TASS report from Pyongyang: With the development of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's industry and the continuous increase of workers and staff, housing construction has also developed rapidly. The Republic's government has allocated large sums of money for housing construction. According to the Labor News, 31,700 new homes will be built for workers and staff this year. In the near future, miners will move into 4,000 new homes.
    In addition, according to the "Democratic Overseas Chinese" newspaper published in Pyongyang, citing a report from the South Korean "Kyongsong News": Since the establishment of the Syngman Rhee puppet "government," in the year and a half up to December 20, 1949, as many as 523,000 people in South Korea were displaced due to the puppet government's forced "evacuation," and 40,220 houses were burned down as a result of the "evacuation." According to the "Fighter News," 99,000 households in South Korea currently live in tents, caves, and air-raid shelters, and this figure does not include the farmers displaced by the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's scorched-earth tactics.
