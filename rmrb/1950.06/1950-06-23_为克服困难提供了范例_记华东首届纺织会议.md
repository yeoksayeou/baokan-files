　　Provided a Model for Overcoming Difficulties
　　Record of the First East China Textile Conference

　　To overcome difficulties and strive for improvement, the First East China Textile Conference was held in Shanghai on the 16th of last month and closed after eight days. The conference achieved the following three major accomplishments.

　　The first achievement of the conference was the promotion of democratic spirit and the establishment of a production plan to overcome difficulties. Participants in the conference included a total of one hundred and thirty representatives from administrative organs, trade unions, state-owned and private cotton textile, wool textile, silk textile, dyeing and weaving, and knitting industries from provinces, cities, and districts such as Shanghai, Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. During the conference, democracy was fully promoted, and everyone spoke their minds freely, enabling the conference to formulate a unified production plan based on the specific circumstances of state-owned and private factories in various regions. This included issues such as operating rates, raw materials, contract spinning and weaving, and processing fees. According to the provisions of this production plan, the number of private spindles in operation would reach 74% of the installed spindles, and the number of state-owned factory spindles would reach 90% of the total number of state-owned factory spindles. It was also decided that private factories would operate for four days and four nights per week, while state-owned factories, due to their substantial financial burdens and responsibility for supplying the market, would operate for five days and five nights per week. According to this decision, there should be no problem in supplying the raw cotton needed by state-owned and private factories for five months. Regarding the increase in contract spinning, it is proposed to request approval from the Central People's Government; contract weaving, since yarn factories are already engaged in contract spinning, should focus on the dyeing and weaving industry. The government has not only adjusted processing fees but has also taken measures to reduce electricity costs and lower interest rates. Currently, the processing cost of the private Hongfeng Yarn Factory in Shanghai has been reduced to 203 converted units. Compared to the processing fee revenue of 224 converted units, there is a surplus of one unit. When this fact was presented in the panel discussions, it greatly enhanced the confidence of various factories in reforming their management and reducing costs.

　　The second achievement of the conference was the determination of a new management policy. Under the guidance of this new management policy, East China's textile industry, which accounts for the largest proportion in our country, will break away from its dependence on imperialism and achieve normal development on the basis of self-reliance. During the conference discussions, many representatives also pointed out with deep sorrow that in the past, under the traitorous policy of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, they colluded with imperialists to plunder our country's wealth with American cotton, causing the bankruptcy of our country's rural economy, shrinking of the domestic market, and the death of national industrial and commercial enterprises. It was unanimously recognized that the development of national industry and commerce and the economic aggression of imperialism cannot coexist. Therefore, the first content of the new policy is to thoroughly eradicate the psychological dependence on imperialism. The second is to transform the past practice of speculation and greed for exorbitant profits, and to obtain legitimate profits from all aspects of careful calculation, strict frugality, streamlined organization, and increased production efficiency. At the same time, the distribution of profits must also focus on expanding reproduction. The third content is: future management methods should be enterprise-based competition and mutual learning, rather than taking advantage of contradictions, harming others for personal gain, and mutual exclusion. That is, in order to achieve rational management, each private factory should, through discussions between labor and management and engineering personnel, formulate relatively practical management standards regarding material determination, quality determination, quantity determination, and personnel determination. The decision of this new policy provides a guideline for the transformation of production organization in private enterprises in the future.

　　The third achievement of the conference was that through the discussions of the labor-management groups and the collection of opinions from various parties, the experience of overcoming difficulties in various regions was exchanged. As a result, the representatives of both labor and management further enhanced their confidence in overcoming difficulties and unanimously agreed that doing a good job in labor-management relations is the main link in overcoming current difficulties and developing production in the future. Thus, three drafts were formulated: the East China Textile Industry Labor Convention, the reward and punishment methods, and the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings in private factories. After the conference, the Shanghai Liberation Daily published an editorial on the 26th of last month entitled "Provided a Model for Overcoming Difficulties," in which it made an appropriate assessment of the achievements of the conference, believing that this conference "provided a good model in adjusting the relationship between industry and commerce and between public and private sectors, especially in changing the enterprise management policy, which is not only applicable to the textile industry, but also a way for other industries to overcome difficulties."

　　为克服困难提供了范例
    记华东首届纺织会议
    为仁
    为克服困难争取好转，华东首届纺织会议于上月十六日在沪召开，历时八天闭幕。会议取得了如下的三个重大成就。
    会议的第一个成就，是发扬了民主精神，订定了克服困难的生产计划。参加这次会议的包括上海、山东、苏北、苏南及浙江等省、市、区的行政机关、工会、公营和私营的棉纺织业、毛纺织业、丝织业、染织业和针织业等公私和劳资的代表共一百三十人。在会议进行期中，充分发扬了民主，真正做到了知无不言，言无不尽，使大会能根据各地区公私营工厂的具体情况，订出了统一的生产计划，其中包括开工率、原料、代纺代织、工缴等问题。依照这个生产计划的规定，私营纺锭开工数达设备锭数的百分之七十四，公营厂为全部公营厂锭数设备的百分之九十，并决定私营厂开工日数为每周四天四夜，公营厂由于负担巨大的财政任务及供应市场的责任，开工数为每周五天五夜。依照此项决定，公私营厂五个月的所需原棉供应，当无问题。关于增加代纺问题，则拟提请中央人民政府考虑批准；代织则由于纱厂已经代纺，故重点应放在染织业上。工缴费政府不仅已经调整，而且还作了减低电费、降低利息的措施。现在沪市私营鸿丰纱厂的工缴成本已降到二○三个折实单位，如与二二四个折实单位的工缴费收入相比，能余一一个单位。这个事实在小组会中被提出时，大大增强了各厂改革经营管理、减低成本的信心。
    会议的第二个成就，是确定了新的经营方针。在这个新的经营方针的指导下，将使占有我国最大比重的华东纺织业，从此摆脱对帝国主义的依赖，而在自力更生的基础上得到正常的发展。在会议讨论过程中，亦曾有许多代表沉痛地指出过去蒋介石匪帮在卖国投靠的政策下，勾结帝国主义者以美棉掠夺我国的财富，造成我国农村经济破产、国内市场萎缩，置民族工商业于死地的罪恶。并一致认识到民族工商业的发展与帝国主义的经济侵略是不能并存的。故新方针的第一个内容即是彻底根除对帝国主义的依赖心理。其次是转变过去趋向投机、贪图暴利的作风，要从精打细算、厉行节约、精干机构、发挥生产效率各方面来取得正当的利润。同时利润的分配也须着重于扩大再生产。第三个内容是：今后的经营方法，应是企业化的竞赛和互相观摩，而不应是利用矛盾、损人利己和互相排挤，亦即各私营厂为了达到经营合理化的目的，应经劳资双方和工程人员的研讨，订出比较合乎实际的关于定料、定质、定量、定员的经营标准。这个新方针的决定提供了今后私营企业改造生产组织的准绳。
    会议的第三个成就，是通过了劳资小组的讨论和收集了各方意见，交流了各地克服困难的经验，因而与会劳资双方代表进一步提高了克服困难的信心，且一致认为搞好劳资关系为当前克服困难及今后发展生产的主要环节，从而拟定了华东区纺织工业劳动公约、奖惩办法及在私营厂普遍建立劳资协商会议等三个草案。会议结束后，上海解放日报曾于上月二十六日发表题为“为克服困难提供了范例”的社论，文中对此项会议的成就作了适当的估价，认为这个会议“在调整工商业与公私关系方面，特别是在改变企业经营方针方面，提供了一个良好范例，这不仅适用于纺织业，亦为其他各业克服困难的途径。”
