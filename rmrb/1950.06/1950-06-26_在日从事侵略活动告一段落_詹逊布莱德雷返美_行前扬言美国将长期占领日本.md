Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: U.S. Secretary of Defense Jenson and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, who arrived in Japan from the Philippines on the 17th to engage in invasion activities, left Tokyo on the 23rd to return to the U.S. Jenson made a statement at Haneda Airport before leaving Tokyo, bluntly revealing the reactionary anti-Japanese policy of the U.S. government, saying, "The security of the United States is inextricably linked to the method by which the United States maintains its current position in the Far East."

　　The activities of the war-mongers Jenson and others in Japan prove that it is part of the U.S. government's conspiracy to further implement the invasion of Asia, especially the colonization and military base of Japan. In the four days up to the 21st, Jenson held meetings with MacArthur and inspected U.S. naval and air force bases in Japan. On the 21st, Jenson openly stated at Yokosuka Naval Base: "This base is a base that the United States must ensure in its strategic system in the Far East." On the 22nd, Jenson inspected Okinawa Island in the Ryukyu Islands and issued a statement saying: "Even after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, the United States hopes to continue to occupy this strategic island located in the sea controlled by communist China." According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Associated Press on the 23rd, MacArthur requested Jenson and others to bring the following two requests to Washington: (1) The United States should provide active material "aid" to Taiwan and Southeast Asia; (2) The United States should retain all the bases it currently holds in Asia, including bases in Japan, and should send reinforcements.

　　According to a Tokyo dispatch from United Press on the 23rd, after Jenson and Bradley return to the United States, they will first submit the "data" they collected in Asia to the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the Chiefs of Staff for research, and then submit a proposal to Truman on the so-called new Far East policy of the United States before August; at that time, Dulles will also submit a proposal on the so-called "Japanese peace treaty." After this, Truman will announce the so-called "clear anti-communist Asian policy."

　　On their way back to the United States, Jenson and Bradley will pass through Alaska, thus completing their inspection of the Pacific invasion line from the Philippines to Okinawa Island, Japan to Alaska.

　　在日从事侵略活动告一段落
    詹逊布莱德雷返美
    行前扬言美国将长期占领日本
    【新华社二十五日讯】于十七日由菲律宾到达日本从事侵略活动的美国国防部长詹逊和联合参谋长会议主席布莱德雷，已于二十三日离东京首途返美。詹逊于离东京前在羽田机场发表声明，露骨地说出美国政府这种反动的对日政策称：“美国的安全保障，是和美国在远东保有目前地位的方法紧密不可分的。”
    詹逊等战争贩子在日本所进行的活动，证明是美国政府进一步实行侵略亚洲，特别是使日本殖民地化和军事基地化的阴谋的一部分。在截至二十一日的四天中，詹逊曾与麦克阿瑟举行会议，并巡视了在日本的美国海空军基地。二十一日，詹逊在横须贺海军基地发表声明时公开声称：“这一基地是美国在远东战略体制上必须要加以确保的基地”。二十二日，詹逊到琉球群岛的冲绳岛视察，并发表声明说：“纵使在对日和约签字以后，美国也希望继续占领这一位于共产党控制的中国海面的战略岛屿。”据美联社东京二十三日电称：麦克阿瑟要求詹逊等将以下两点要求带交华盛顿：（一）美国应给予台湾及东南亚以积极的物质“援助”；（二）美国应保留目前在亚洲保有的一切基地，包括日本的基地在内，并应派遣援军。
    另据合众社东京二十三日电称：詹逊、布莱德雷两人返美后，将先把他们在亚洲所收集的“资料”交由陆海空军部长、参谋长研究，然后再于八月前就美国的所谓新远东政策向杜鲁门提出建议；届时，杜勒斯也将就所谓“日本和约”问题提出建议。在此以后，杜鲁门将宣布所谓“明确的反共的亚洲政策”。
    詹逊与布莱德雷等在返美途中，将经过阿拉斯加，从而完成其对自菲律宾至冲绳岛、日本至阿拉斯加的太平洋侵略线的视察。
