　　Shanxi Improves Agricultural Technology
    Farmers Create Many New Types of Farm Implements
    [Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th] Since the land reform, farmers in various parts of Shanxi Province, under the leadership of agricultural technology committees or agricultural technology research groups in counties, districts, and villages, have launched a movement to improve agricultural technology and have achieved great results. This is a new phenomenon in the countryside after the land reform. Farmers in various places generally plow and harrow autumn land two to three times, hoe wheat fields one to three times, and roll and rake once, while also applying large amounts of fertilizer, achieving more plowing, more hoeing, and more fertilization. The vast majority of farmers in the Changzhi Special District pay attention to improving fertilizer composting techniques and apply fertilizer according to different soil types to maximize its effectiveness. Farmers in the Zhanghe River area of ​​Yushe County used the method of carrying sand for infiltration and padding to transform 2,000 mu of acidic soil along the Zhanghe River into neutral soil, making it more suitable for planting. At the same time, farmers in various places are also committed to the improvement and creation of agricultural implements. Many improved and new agricultural implements have emerged throughout the province. For example, the Zhang Furen mutual aid group in Yushe collectively created the "single-person sowing plow," Han Zhizhong and Sun Quanniu in Lingchuan jointly created the "ridge-cutting drill," farmers in Lucheng created the "empty person hoe" and "three-legged drill," and farmers in Xiangyuan made "lightweight hoes for women," and so on. All of these farm implements save 10% to 30% of labor compared to the old-fashioned implements. In addition, great achievements have also been made in seeding and seed mixing. Farmers throughout the province have selected more than 30 kinds of superior varieties for mass breeding and promotion, and more than 2 million mu of grain crops were sown after being disinfected with chemical agents during spring sowing to resist diseases and increase yields. Other tasks, such as livestock epidemic prevention and the purchase of medicines and machinery, are also being carried out throughout the province. As of the end of May, 160,000 head of livestock in the province had been vaccinated. Farmers in the Changzhi Special District jointly purchased more than 250 pieces of scientific disinfection and pest control equipment called "sprayers" to actively prevent and control pests.
    In order to effectively guide and assist farmers throughout the province in the movement to improve agricultural technology, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government successively concentrated on training more than 2,000 key agricultural cadres and some rural work cadres and technical models from various counties and districts in twelve central cities such as Taiyuan and Changzhi in February of this year. Through them, agricultural science and technology and mass experience were initially combined. On the one hand, 62 agricultural technology extension stations at the provincial, special, and county levels, 22 new agricultural implement extension stations, and 6 breeding stock stations were established within the province. In addition, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government also provided various localities with superior varieties worth 1.3 million jin of millet, as well as a large amount of agricultural medicines such as DDT, sodium fluosilicate, wine for seed mixing, and red alum for application.

　　山西改进农业技术
    农民创造不少新式农具
    【新华社太原十九日电】土地改革后的山西省各地农民，在各县、区、村农业技术委员会或农业技术研究小组的领导下，展开改进农业技术运动，已获得很大的成绩。这是土地改革后农村中的新气象，各地农民普遍地将秋地耕耙二遍至三遍，麦地锄了一遍至三遍和滚耙一遍，同时又施上大量的肥料，做到了多耕、多锄、多施肥。长治专区绝大多数农民都注意改进肥料沤制的技术，并按不同的土壤分别施肥，使肥料发挥更大的效用。榆社县沿漳河一带农民用担沙渗垫的办法，将漳河沿岸二千亩酸性土壤地改变成中性土壤地，使其更适于种植。同时，各地农民还致力于农具的改进和创造，全省现已出现了不少的改良农具和新式农具。如榆社张辅仁互助组集体创造了“单人播种犁”，陵川韩志中、孙全妞两人合作创造了“断垄耧”，潞城农民创造了“空人锄”、“三腿耧”，襄垣农民制出“女用轻便锄”等等。所有这些农具，都比旧式的农具节省百分之十至三十的人工。此外，还种、拌种等工作也已有了很大的成绩。全省农民共已选出优良品种三十余种，以供大量繁殖推广之用，并在春播时将二百余万亩粮食作物经化学药剂消毒拌种后下种；以抵抗病害，提高产量。其他如牲畜防疫、购置药械等工作也在各地普遍进行。至五月下旬止，全省已有十六万头牲口经过了防疫注射。长治专区农民合资购买科学消毒灭虫用具“喷雾器”二百五十余件，积极防治虫害。
    山西省人民政府为有力地指导和帮助全省各地农民的改进农业技术运动，曾于今年二月先后在太原、长治等十二个中心城市，集中训练了各县、区农业主要干部和一部分农村工作干部、技术模范等共两千余人，通过他们使农业科学技术与群众经验初步地结合起来；一面又在省内建立省、专、县各级农业技术推广场六十二处、新式农具推广站二十二处和种畜站六处。另外，山西省人民政府又以价值一百三十万斤小米的优良品种以及大量的滴滴涕、氟矽酸钠、拌种用酒、红矾等农用药品，供给各地应用。
