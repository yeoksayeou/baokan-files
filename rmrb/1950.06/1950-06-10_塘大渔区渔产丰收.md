    This spring, the Tanggu-Dagu Fishing Area has seen a bumper harvest of aquatic products. According to incomplete statistics, as of now, the total catch of various aquatic products in the area has reached 8 million jin, exceeding the catch of last spring. The main aquatic products are prawns, sea crabs, yellow croaker, and chub mackerel, especially prawns, the production of which is the highest in six years. It is now the chub mackerel season, and the fishing boats in the area are going out to sea to fish. Some fishing boats have caught more than 20,000 fish each in just over ten days, which is almost equal to the catch of each boat for a whole season last year. The chub mackerel season still has more than 20 days left, and it is estimated that the output of chub mackerel this year will greatly exceed that of last year. Currently, the state-owned fish stores and the cooperative fish stores organized by the fishermen are purchasing various aquatic products in large quantities at reasonable prices according to the market scales stipulated by the People's Government. The lives of the fishermen in the area are now improving day by day. Many fishermen have paid off their old debts and are building new houses and purchasing fishing gear.
