　　【Shanghai News】 *Liberation Daily* news: Yingzi Village, Shicun District, Suxian County, Northern Anhui, understood from meticulous accounting that the summer famine after the wheat harvest was still very serious. By formulating plans for each household, they established a long-term production and famine preparedness ideology. Since the village received grain relief from the People's Government and leadership in production, it had successfully overcome the spring famine. However, the summer famine problem still existed. The village has a total of 295 households, 1,319 people, and 1,321.4 mu of land. Due to three consecutive periods of heavy rain and snow last winter, 736 mu of fields were completely flooded. The remaining 585 mu only had 30% to 50% yields. Therefore, some cadres and the masses are currently pessimistic, while others believe that getting through the spring famine until the wheat harvest is like passing a barrier, harboring a paralyzing thought of "not worrying about whether there is a wheat harvest, there will always be a way." After understanding this situation, the work team of the Suxian County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held meetings with village chiefs, group leaders, and Party members and members of the Communist Youth League, mobilizing everyone to go deep into each household to investigate the summer harvest situation. They also investigated the disaster and meticulously accounted for the situation household by household, understanding the extent of the disaster in the village. From the wheat harvest to the autumn harvest, there are a total of 75 days. Based on an estimate of 2 jin of grain consumed per person per day, there will be a total grain shortage of 84,330 jin by the autumn harvest; 3,000 jin of wheat seeds will also be needed after the autumn harvest.

　　After this detailed calculation, the paralyzing thoughts of cadres and the masses about the disaster situation were dispelled. Then, they seized the opportunity to formulate production plans for each household to overcome the famine. At the same time, the entire village made overall plans, requiring: ① Seizing the time to promptly plant sorghum. ② Planting early-maturing crops, with each person planting ten pumpkin plants. ③ Low-lying areas can be planted with rice, sesame, and beans, so that there will be harvests regardless of rain or drought, with each group planting 150 mu. Based on the above plan, a total calculation was made, and the entire village has confidence in overcoming the summer famine. Because 190 people in the village can weave straw rain capes, they can earn 52.5 million yuan in the 70 days from now until the seventh month of the lunar calendar, which can be exchanged for 52,500 jin of grain. According to incomplete statistics, the whole village has one hundred and fifty nets for catching fish, starting from the end of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, it can earn 36,000 jin of grain in the sixty days of July, these two side occupations alone can earn 88,500 jin. Pumpkins can be ready to eat 30 days earlier, so 713 people can save 42,780 jin, totaling 131,280 jin of grain. In addition to making up for the shortage of rations of 84,430 jin, there is also a solution for the 3,000 mu of wheat seeds (16 jin required per mu).

　　Currently, the entire village has begun to rush plant sorghum and pumpkins, and other sideline production is also underway.

　　算细账了解夏荒严重
    宿县营子村订生产计划
    【上海讯】解放日报消息：皖北宿县时村区营子村，从算细账中了解麦收后夏荒仍很严重，通过各户订计划，确立了长期生产备荒思想。该村在人民政府的贷粮救济，领导生产以来，胜利的度过春荒。但夏荒问题仍存在。该村共有二百九十五户，一千三百一十九人，一千三百二十一亩四分田，因去冬连遭三次霪雨恶雪，有七百三十六亩田全被淹光。其他五百八十五亩，仅有三至五成收成。因此目前有部分干部、群众产生了悲观情绪，但另有部分干部和群众却认为度过春荒到麦口，就是过了一关，存在着“不问它有无麦收，总有办法”的麻痹思想。中共宿县地委工作队了解此情况后，即在该村分别召开村长组长与党员、青年团员会议，动员大家深入各户，调查夏收情况。并逐户查灾算细账，了解了该村灾情。从麦收到秋收共计有七十五天。以每人每天吃粮二斤计，共计到秋收缺粮八万四千三百三十斤；秋后麦种还需三千斤。
    经此详细一算，干部、群众对灾情的麻痹思想即被打消。接着又抓紧时机按户订出生产度荒计划，同时全村又作了整个打算，要求：①抓紧时间，及时抢种秫秫。②种早熟庄稼，每人要种十棵南瓜。③洼地可种稻与芝麻、豆子，以便雨旱都有收成，每组要种一百五十亩。根据以上的计划作总的计算，全村都有信心度过夏荒。因全村一百九十人会打斗篷，从现在到旧历七月的七十天中，可得利五千二百五十万元，可换粮五万二千五百斤。全村据不完全统计，有一百五十条网打鱼，从旧历四月底算起，到七月六十天中，可赚粮三万六千斤，单这两项副业就可赚八万八千五百斤。南瓜能早接嘴三十天，七百十三人又可省四万二千七百八十斤，总计可得粮为十三万一千二百八十斤，除弥补所缺口粮八万四千四百三十斤外，连三千亩麦种（每亩须十六斤）也有了办法。
    现全村已开始抢种秫秫和南瓜，其他副业生产也正在进行中。
