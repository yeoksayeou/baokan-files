Zhi Gong Party Spokesperson Condemns Truman's Statement
    US Imperialist Bandit Aggression Provokes Resistance from People Worldwide
    [This newspaper dispatch] The spokesperson of the China Zhi Gong Party issued a statement on the 29th, condemning the illegal statement of the American imperialist bandit Truman. The full text is as follows:
    Amidst the worldwide people's call for peace, Truman, the representative of American imperialism, actually supported his running dog, the puppet government of the Korean people's traitor, Syngman Rhee, in launching the Korean civil war on June 25th, attacking the People's Democratic Republic of Korea. He shamelessly shifted the responsibility for initiating this war onto the Korean Republic. This behavior is enough to arouse the anger of people worldwide. Unexpectedly, on the 27th, the bandit chieftain Truman further issued a preposterous statement, ordering MacArthur to directly intervene in the Korean civil war with armed forces; announcing that the US government had decided to use force to prevent our army from liberating Taiwan, and dispatching the Seventh Fleet to support the remnant forces of the Chiang bandits in Taiwan. Such direct armed intervention in our country's internal affairs and armed occupation of our territory is infuriating to our people!
    Hasn't the US government repeatedly stated for the past half year that it "respects China's territorial integrity"? On the 23rd of this month, Acheson reaffirmed the validity of Truman's special statement of January 5th regarding the Taiwan issue? However, after only a few days, the American imperialists went back on their own words, violating the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations, tearing up the UN Charter, and invading the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Korea. This behavior fully proves that all previous statements of the American imperialists were just a series of deceptive talks, thoroughly exposing the bandit face of the American imperialists. This arrogant act of disrupting peace in the Far East will undoubtedly arouse resolute resistance from the people of our country, the people of Asia, and the people of the world, and will educate and inspire the people of the whole country, all people's organizations, and all democratic parties to unite more closely against all aggression by the American imperialists.
    We solemnly declare that Taiwan is our country's territory and no country is allowed to invade it. At the same time, we will warn the American imperialists and their pirate gangs that you have interfered in our country's affairs countless times in the past hundred years. Which time did you not end up with your heads broken and bleeding? And the result of your aggression and interference was the emergence of the People's Republic of China. Moreover, in today's world, when the power of the Chinese people is unprecedentedly great and the power of the imperialists is inherently more fragile, will the Chinese people be softened by you? We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. We must not only liberate our Taiwan from the hands of the American imperialists with the strength of the whole country, but we must also call on the people of all Asia and the world to unite and stop the American imperialists' aggressive crimes, and shatter the American imperialists' war plots and all imperialist policies in the people's angry tide!

　　致公党发言人斥杜鲁门声明
    美帝强盗侵略行为激起世界人民反抗
    【本报讯】中国致公党发言人于二十九日发表斥美帝国主义强盗杜鲁门非法声明的声明。全文如下：
    正在全世界人民呼吁和平声中，美国帝国主义的代表杜鲁门居然支持其走狗朝鲜人民的蟊贼李承晚傀儡政府于六月二十五日发动朝鲜内战，进攻人民民主朝鲜，并且还无耻地将这种发动战争的责任，转嫁于朝鲜共和国，这样的行为已足引起全世界人民的愤怒。不料，紧接着在二十七日强盗首领杜鲁门却更进一步地发表了狂妄声明，命令麦克阿瑟直接武装干涉朝鲜内战；宣布美国政府决定以武力阻止我军解放台湾，并且派遣第七舰队，支持蒋匪在台湾残余力量。这样直接以武力干涉我国内政，武装占领我国领土，实令我国人民发指眦裂！
    半年来，美国政府不是曾一再声明什么“尊重中国的领土完整”吗？本月二十三日艾奇逊还重申一月五日杜鲁门关于台湾问题专门声明的有效吗？可是，时不几日，美国帝国主义者却一反以往他自己所说的，竟违背开罗及波茨坦两次宣言，撕毁了联合国宪章，侵略中华人民共和国和朝鲜共和国。这种行为十足证明美国帝国主义者以往的一切声明只是一连串的欺人之谈，彻底暴露出美国帝国主义者的强盗面目。它这种狂妄的破坏远东和平的行动，无疑地，将引起我国人民、亚洲人民、以及全世界人民的坚决反抗，并且将教育和激励我全国人民、各人民团体、各民主党派更加团结起来，反对美国帝国主义者的一切侵略。
    我们特严正声明，台湾是我国的领土，绝不允许任何国家侵犯。同时，我们更将警告美国帝国主义和其海盗伙帮，你们百余年来干涉我国的行为，不知多少次了，那一次不是碰得你们头破血流，而你们侵略和干涉的结果，却出现了一个中华人民共和国。何况在中国人民的力量空前伟大，帝国主义者的力量在本质上更为脆弱的今天，中国人民还会被你们软化吗？我们完全拥护周外长的声明，我们不仅一定要以全国的力量从美国帝国主义者的手中解放自己的台湾，我们还要号召全亚洲以及全世界人民，一致起来，制止美帝的侵略罪行，把美帝的战争企图和帝国主义的一切政策粉碎在人民怒潮里！
