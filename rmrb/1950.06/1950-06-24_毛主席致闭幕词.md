Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: Chairman Mao Zedong's closing address at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The full text is as follows:

　　This meeting has summarized the experiences of the past period and decided on various policies.

　　This work of summarizing experience and deciding on policies was done by all of us together, by the representatives of all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and democratic figures from all walks of life. Here, not only were there members of the National Committee of the CPPCC, but also many staff members of the Central People's Government, the Greater Administrative Region People's Governments (Military and Political Committees), and the People's Governments of various provinces and cities attended and participated in the discussions. Moreover, representatives of the People's Representative Conference Consultative Committees of various provinces and cities attended and participated in the discussions. Furthermore, many specially invited patriotic figures attended and participated in the discussions. In this way, we can gather broad opinions, examine past work, and decide on future policies. I hope that we will continue to adopt this method in the future, and I hope that the Greater Administrative Region People's Governments (Military and Political Committees) and the People's Governments of various provinces and cities will also adopt this method. Our meetings are still advisory in nature for the time being. But in reality, the decisions we make at these meetings will naturally be adopted and implemented by the Central People's Government, and should be adopted and implemented.

　　We unanimously agreed to the work reports of the National Committee and the various work reports of the Central People's Government. These include reports on land reform work, political work, military work, economic and financial work, taxation work, cultural and educational work, and court work. These reports are all good. In these reports, the work experience of the past period has been appropriately summarized, and the future work policies have been stipulated. The reason why we have so many topics at this meeting is that since the founding of our new country, work in all aspects has been pioneering and developing. The people of the whole country are vigorously carrying out the great struggle of the true people's revolution on all fronts, on the military front, on the economic front, on the ideological front, and on the land reform front, all of which are unprecedentedly great struggles. All work needs to be summarized and needs to be given directions, so we have so many topics. According to legal regulations, our meeting is held twice a year, one of which will be a meeting with many topics, and the other will be a meeting with fewer topics. China is a large country, with an actual population of over 475 million, and is in the great historical period of the people's revolution. This situation requires us to do this, and we have done so. I think we have done it right.

　　We have many topics at this meeting, and the central topic is the issue of reforming the old land system. Everyone agreed to Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report and the draft of the Land Reform Law proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and made some beneficial revisions and supplements to the draft of the Land Reform Law. This is very good. I express my joy and congratulations for the opportunity for hundreds of millions of rural people in the new China to stand up and for the country to obtain the basic conditions for industrialization. The main population of China is farmers. The revolution relied on the assistance of farmers to achieve victory, and national industrialization must also rely on the assistance of farmers to succeed. Therefore, the working class should actively help farmers carry out land reform, and the petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie should also support this reform. All democratic parties and people's organizations should take this attitude. War and land reform are the two "tests" for all people and all parties in China during the historical period of New Democracy. Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and who stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary. Whoever stands only verbally on the side of the revolutionary people but acts differently is a verbal revolutionary. If he stands not only verbally but also in action on the side of the revolutionary people, he is a complete revolutionary. The war hurdle has basically passed. We all passed this hurdle very well, and the people of the whole country are satisfied. Now it is time to pass the land reform hurdle. I hope we all pass it as well as we passed the war hurdle. Everyone should study and discuss more, clear their minds, align their steps, and form a great anti-feudal united front, so that they can lead the people and help the people to smoothly pass this hurdle. As long as the war hurdle and the land reform hurdle are passed, the remaining hurdle will be easy to pass, that is, the hurdle of socialism, the hurdle of implementing socialist transformation on a national scale. As long as people have contributed to the revolutionary war and the revolutionary land system reform, and have also contributed to economic construction and cultural construction in the coming years, when the time comes to implement the nationalization of industry and the socialization of agriculture (which will be in the distant future), the people will not forget them, and their future is bright. Our country is advancing steadily in this way, through war, through the reform of New Democracy, and in the future, after the country's economic and cultural undertakings have greatly prospered, after various conditions are met, and after the people of the whole country have considered carefully and everyone has agreed, we can calmly and properly enter the new period of socialism. I think it is necessary to make this clear, so that people can have confidence, not be hesitant and worried, and not wonder when you will not want me anymore, and I will not have the opportunity to serve the people even if I want to. No, it won't be like that. As long as someone is willing to truly serve the people, has indeed helped and done good things in the period when the people are still in difficulty, and continues to do so consistently without giving up halfway, then the people and the people's government have no reason not to want him, and have no reason not to give him the opportunity to live and the opportunity to serve.

　　On this long-term goal, in foreign affairs, we must firmly unite with the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries, and all peace-loving and democratic forces in the world. There must be no wavering or hesitation on this point. Domestically, we must unite all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all patriotic democratic figures. We must consolidate our already established great and prestigious revolutionary united front. Whoever contributes to the consolidation of this revolutionary united front, we welcome him, and he is correct; whoever harms the consolidation of this revolutionary united front, we oppose him, and he is wrong. To achieve the goal of consolidating the revolutionary united front, we must adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism. The main standard used when adopting this method is our current fundamental law, the Common Program. In this meeting, we adopted the method of criticism and self-criticism based on the Common Program. This is a very good method, a good method to promote everyone to adhere to the truth and correct mistakes, and the only correct method for all revolutionary people in the people's country to conduct self-education and self-transformation. The people's democratic dictatorship has two methods. For the enemy, the method of dictatorship is used, that is to say, in the necessary period, they are not allowed to participate in political activities, they are forced to obey the laws of the People's Government, they are forced to engage in labor, and they are transformed into new people in labor. For the people, it is the opposite. Instead of using coercion, we use democratic methods, that is, they must be allowed to participate in political activities. Instead of forcing them to do this or that, we use democratic methods to educate and persuade them. This education is the self-education of the people, and the method of criticism and self-criticism is the basic method of self-education. I hope that all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all patriotic democratic figures in the country will adopt this method.

　　毛主席致闭幕词
    【新华社二十三日讯】毛泽东主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的闭幕词。全文如下：
    此次会议总结了过去时期的经验，决定了各项方针。
    这种总结经验和决定方针的工作，是我们大家一齐来做的，是各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和各界民主人士的代表人物集合在一起来做的。这里，不但有人民政协全国委员会的委员们，而且有中央人民政府、各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）及各省市人民政府的许多工作人员列席参加讨论，而且有各省市各界人民代表会议协议委员会的代表们列席参加讨论，而且有许多特邀的爱国人士列席参加讨论。这样，我们就能集中广泛的意见，检查过去的工作，决定今后的方针。这种方法，我希望我们以后继续采用，并且希望各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）和各省市人民政府也采用这种方法。我们的会议在暂时还是建议性质的会议。但是在实际上，我们在这种会议上所做的决定，中央人民政府是当然会采纳并见之实行的，是应当采纳并见之实行的。
    我们一致同意了全国委员会的会务报告和中央人民政府的各项工作报告。这里有土地改革工作，政治工作，军事工作，经济和财政工作，税收工作，文化和教育工作，法院工作等项报告，这些报告都是好的。在这些报告中，适当地总结了过去时期的工作经验，规定了今后的工作方针。我们这次会议所以有这样多的议题，是因为我们的新国家成立以后，各方面工作都在开创，都在发展，全国人民正在蓬蓬勃勃地在各个战线上开展真正人民革命的伟大斗争，在军事战线上，在经济战线上，在思想战线上，在土地改革的战线上都是从古未有的极其伟大的斗争，各项工作都待总结，都待指示方针，所以我们有了这样多的议题。我们的会议按法律规定是每年开会两次，其中将有一次为议题众多的会议，一次为议题较少的会议。中国是一个大国，实际的人口超过四万七千五百万，又处在人民革命的伟大历史时期，这种情况要求我们这样做，我们也就这样做了，我想我们是做得对的。
    我们这次会议议题众多，中心的议题是将旧有土地制度加以改革的问题。大家同意刘少奇副主席的报告及中共中央建议的土地改革法草案，并对土地改革法草案作了若干有益的修改和补充。这是很好的，我为新中国数万万农村人民获得翻身机会和国家获得工业化的基本条件而表示高兴，表示庆贺。中国的主要人口是农民，革命靠了农民的援助才取得了胜利，国家工业化又要靠农民的援助才能成功，所以工人阶级应当积极地帮助农民进行土地改革，小资产阶级和民族资产阶级也应当赞助这种改革，各民主党派各人民团体更应当采取这种态度。战争和土改是在新民主主义的历史时期内考验全中国一切人们、一切党派的两个“关”。什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。什么人只是口头上站在革命人民方面而在行动上则另是一样，他就是一个口头革命派，如果不但在口头上而且在行动上也站在革命人民方面，他就是一个完全的革命派。战争一关，已经基本上过去了，这一关我们大家都过得很好，全国人民是满意的。现在是要过土改一关，我希望我们大家都和过战争关一样也过得很好。大家多研究，多商量，打通思想，整齐步伐，组成一条伟大的反封建统一战线，就可以领导人民和帮助人民顺利地通过这一关。只要战争关、土改关都过去了，剩下的一关就将容易过去的，那就是社会主义的一关，在全国范围内实行社会主义改造的那一关。只要人们在革命战争中，在革命的土地制度改革中有了贡献，又在今后多年的经济建设和文化建设中有所贡献，等到将来实行工业国有化和农业社会化的时候（这种时候还在很远的将来），人民是不会把他们忘记的，他们的前途是光明的。我们的国家就是这样地稳步前进，经过战争，经过新民主主义的改革，而在将来，在国家经济事业和文化事业大为兴盛了以后，在各种条件具备了以后，在全国人民考虑成熟并在大家同意了以后，就可以从容地和妥善地走进社会主义的新时期。我认为讲明这一点是有必要的，这样可以使人们有信心，不致彷徨顾虑，不知道什么时候你们不要我了，我虽想为人民效力也没有机会了。不，不会这样的，只要谁肯真正为人民效力，在人民还有困难的时期内确实帮了忙，做了好事，并且是一贯地做下去，并不半途而废，那末，人民和人民的政府是没有理由不要他的，是没有理由不给他以生活的机会和效力的机会的。
    在这个远大目标上，在国外，我们必须坚固地团结苏联、各新民主国家及全世界一切和平民主力量，对此不可有丝毫的游移和动摇。在国内，我们必须团结各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体及一切爱国民主人士，必须巩固我们这个已经建立的伟大的有威信的革命统一战线。不论什么人，凡对于这个革命统一战线的巩固工作有所贡献者，我们就欢迎他，他就是正确的；凡对于这个革命统一战线的巩固工作有所损害者，我们就反对他，他就是错误的。要达到巩固革命统一战线的目的，必须采取批评和自我批评的方法。采取这种方法时所用的标准，主要是我们现时的根本大法即共同纲领。我们在这次会议中，即根据共同纲领，采取了批评和自我批评的方法。这是一个很好的方法，是推动大家坚持真理、修正错误的很好的方法，是人民国家内全体革命人民进行自我教育和自我改造的惟一正确的方法。人民民主专政有两个方法。对敌人说来是用专政的方法，就是说在必要的时期内，不让他们参与政治活动，强迫他们服从人民政府的法律，强迫他们从事劳动并在劳动中改造他们成为新人。对人民说来则与此相反，不是用强迫的方法，而是用民主的方法，就是说必须让他们参与政治活动，不是强迫他们做这样做那样，而是用民主的方法向他们进行教育和说服的工作。这种教育工作是人民内部的自我教育工作，批评和自我批评的方法就是自我教育的基本方法。我希望全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和一切爱国民主人士，都采用这种方法。
