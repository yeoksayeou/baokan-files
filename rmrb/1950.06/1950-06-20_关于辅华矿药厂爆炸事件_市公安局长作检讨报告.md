Regarding the Fuhua Mining Pharmaceutical Factory Explosion

City Public Security Bureau Chief Makes Self-Criticism Report

[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Luo Ruiqing, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Deputy Directors Feng Jiping and Zhang Minghe, regarding the explosion at the Fuhua Mining Pharmaceutical Factory in the eastern suburbs, submitted a report to the Municipal Government on the 16th. In addition to reporting the facts of the incident, they also conducted a profound self-criticism on the occurrence of this incident and requested punishment. The original text is as follows:

I. The Course of the Incident:

The Beijing Fuhua Heji Mining Pharmaceutical Factory is located at 117 Chaoyangmen Outer Street in the eastern suburbs, originally privately operated by Wang Nianwei. It opened in 1948, with a small scale at the time. In May of last year, it added the production of detonators, increasing the number of employees to thirteen. In February of this year, it entered into a contract with the 208th Division to become a joint public-private enterprise, managed by Qu Derun of the 208th Division and the original owner Wang Nianwei. It was approved by the Industry Bureau to open in early February and filed with our bureau on February 10th. After the joint venture, the factory expanded its scale, increasing the number of workers to nineteen. The factory's safety equipment was originally very rudimentary, with only a few fire extinguishers, and management was also very lax. On May 19th, when grinding black powder, sparks were generated from scraping the black powder on the grinding roller, igniting over a hundred catties of finished product, burning workers Wang Shouting and Ma Zhenbang. Wang Shouting died from his injuries after being sent to the hospital. At that time, Political Commissar Yi Bosheng and Deputy Captain Liu Ji of our bureau's fire brigade not only led the team to put out the fire but also inspected the factory, believing that the factory was located in a residential area, the amount of medicine was large, and the danger was very high. They requested relocation to a remote area outside the city. At that time, because the person in charge of the factory was not present, the workers in the factory were told to convey this opinion. On June 7th, the Third Division of the Security Section of our bureau held a control meeting for the gunpowder and sulfur industry. Manager Qu Derun and Wang Ziliang attended the meeting on behalf of the factory. At the meeting, the accident on May 19th at the factory was criticized, and Manager Qu also made a self-criticism, proposing guarantees for future safety. On June 12th, our bureau sent firefighters E Cunxi and Zhang Qingsong to inspect the factory with the local police station and suggested to platoon leader Wang Dianwen, who was at the factory, that he should move quickly. Platoon leader Wang also expressed his acceptance and said that he was looking for a house. Although there had been these inspections and suggestions, as well as the lessons of the first accident, they failed to arouse sufficient attention from the factory, and thus the serious explosion on June 14th occurred. This explosion caused great loss of life and property to the people. As for the cause of the explosion, it is still under investigation.

II. Self-Criticism on This Incident:

Our bureau bears the responsibility for controlling this type of dangerous business. However, due to our lack of scientific knowledge in this area, insufficient estimation and understanding of the potential hazards in our thinking, and insufficient consideration of the safety of the lives and property of the vast number of citizens in the control process, we have failed to fulfill our protective responsibilities.

When the factory filed with our bureau, we did not seriously study and propose opinions. In particular, after the first accident occurred, several inspections and suggestions were empty and ineffective, and we did not strictly enforce the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Sulfur, Gunpowder, Firecracker, and Match Factories in Beijing," promulgated by the Municipal Government on April 1st of this year, to propose effective measures to decisively handle it, which ultimately led to a major disaster. This proves that we lack a serious and responsible spirit, our work is not thorough and in-depth, and there is serious formalism and bureaucracy in our work.

III. Recommendations for the Future:

1.  In the future, all factories and workshops manufacturing explosive and combustible dangerous goods should be located in open areas outside the city and should seriously strengthen various safety facilities. They must not be located in government offices, schools, or residential areas. Those that already exist should be moved immediately and should not be delayed.

2.  In the future, all large-scale storage of explosive and combustible dangerous goods and military depots should be located in open areas outside the city and should seriously strengthen various safety facilities. They must not be located in government offices, schools, or residential areas. Those that already exist should immediately find ways to disperse them.

3.  Whether to consider that in the future, the manufacture and sale of various dangerous goods should be managed by specialized organizations established by the government, and private operation should not be allowed.

In short, due to our negligence and carelessness in our work, and failure to fulfill our due responsibilities, such a serious explosion occurred, causing such heavy losses to the lives and property of the people. We feel deeply ashamed. In the future, in addition to striving to improve our work, avoiding the recurrence of similar incidents, and quickly investigating and determining the direct responsibility for this incident, we request that the superior authorities impose the appropriate punishment to encourage us.

### 关于辅华矿药厂爆炸事件  市公安局长作检讨报告

　　关于辅华矿药厂爆炸事件
    市公安局长作检讨报告
    【京市新闻处讯】市公安局局长罗瑞卿、副局长冯基平、张明河等为东郊辅华矿药厂爆炸事件，特于十六日具呈市府，除报告事实经过外，并对此一事件之发生作了深刻检讨，呈请处分，录原文如次：
    一、事件发生的经过：
    北京辅华合记矿药制造厂设于东郊管界朝阳门外大街一一七号，原系王念维私人经营，于一九四八年开业，当时规模较小，去年五月间增制雷管，职工增至十三人，今年二月间与二○八师订立合同，改为公私合营，由二○八师曲德润及原业主王念维负责经营。于二月初由工业局批准开业，并于二月十日向我局备案。该厂合营后即扩大规模，工人增至十九名，该厂安全设备原甚简陋，只有少数灭火器，在管理上亦甚疏忽，曾于五月十九日碾黑药时，因刮挖碾坨上黑药发生火星，将成品百余斤引着起火，烧伤工人王寿田、马振邦二名，王寿田送医院后伤重身死，当时我局消防队政委伊渤生与副队长刘济除率队扑救外，并对该厂进行检查，认为该厂位于居民区，药量很多，危险性很大，要求迁至城外偏僻地区，当时因该厂负责人不在，乃告厂内工人将此意见转达，六月七日我局三处治安科召开火药硝磺业管制会议时，该厂由经理曲德润、王子良二人出席，会上对该厂五月十九日之事故提出批评，曲经理亦作了自我检讨，并提出对今后安全的保障，六月十二日我局又派消防队鄂存喜、张庆松二人会同派出所检查该厂并向在厂的排长王殿文提出要其迅速迁移，王排长亦表示接受，并称正在找房。虽然有过这些检查与建议以及第一次事故之教训，均未能引起该厂之足够注意，因而又发生了六月十四日的严重爆炸事件。这次爆炸造成了人民生命财产之极大损失。至于该厂爆炸的原因尚正在调查研究中。
    二、对此次事件之检讨：
    我局对此种有危险性之营业负有管制责任，但由于我们缺乏对于这一方面的科学知识，在思想上对其可能发生的危害估计认识不够，在管制中片面的迁就厂方的某些困难而对广大市民生命财产的安全考虑不足，因此未能尽到保护责任。
    该厂在向我局备案时，未予认真研究提出意见，特别是第一次事故发生后，几次检查建议均空洞无力，未发生实际效果，亦未严格强制执行本年四月一日市府公布之“北京市硝磺厂商、火药厂商、花炮业火柴业三种管理暂行办法”，提出有效办法予以断然处置，终致酿成巨祸，证明我们认真负责精神不够，工作不深入与不彻底，工作中存在着严重的形式主义与官僚主义。
    三、对今后的建议：
    １、今后一切制造爆炸性燃烧性等危险物品之工厂、作坊，均应设在城外旷野地区，并认真加强各种安全设备，不得设于机关学校市民住宅区。已有者应立即迁移，不得拖延。
    ２、今后一切富有爆炸性燃烧性等危险物品之大量存储及军火仓库等均应设在城外旷野地区，并认真加强各种安全设备，不得设于机关学校市民住宅区，已有者应即设法疏散。
    ３、是否考虑今后对各种危险物品之制造经售等统由政府设立专门组织机构经营管理，不准私营。
    总之，由于我们工作中的疏忽大意，未尽到应有的责任，以致发生如此严重之爆炸事故，使人民的生命财产遭受如此惨重之损失，深觉惭愧万分，今后除努力改进工作，避免再度发生类此事件，及迅速查清判明此次事件之直接责任者外，请求上级给予应得之处分，以资惕厉。
