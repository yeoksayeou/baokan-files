Leaders at All Levels Emphasize Farmer Education
	She County Villages Universally Establish Civil Schools

[Report from this newspaper] In She County, Hebei Province, 181 out of the 209 administrative villages have established year-round civil schools. Some districts have achieved the goal of every village having a civil school. According to statistics from mid-May, the county has a total of 871 civil schools of varying sizes, with over 16,000 participants, including over 4,800 women and over 1,600 older school-age children who had previously dropped out.

	All village civil schools have established certain learning systems through democratic discussion: independent study at ordinary times, regular centralized classes, with systems for roll call, leave of absence, meetings, inspections, and tests. For example, Yangshuling Village in the First District democratically established a civil school covenant; Zhuangshang Village stipulates inspections twice a week, a test once a month, and entertainment evenings every Saturday. The civil school studies in each district have already achieved significant results. For example, at Wangquanzhuang Civil School, each person recognized an average of more than 40 characters within 20 days. After studying 21 lessons, women at the Suliu Women's Civil School in the Sixth District recognized as many as 80 new characters, with an average of 58 characters recognized.

	The rapid and widespread development of civil school work in the county is due to the following main factors, in addition to the existing foundation of farmer learning and the relatively good development of winter schools last year:

	First, leaders at all levels attach importance to civil schools, and Party members and activists take the lead in learning. Most of the main cadres in the districts and villages of the county personally engage in civil school work. For example, Xu Guiying, deputy district head of the Eighth District, personally arranged and promoted civil school work. He often said, "If civil schools are not done well, adult education will be a problem. Without cultural and scientific knowledge, it will be difficult to do anything." For example, the deputy secretary of the CCP branch in Zhuangshang Village in the First District does not rest at noon, but goes to each street to personally check and help solve problems such as school sites and textbooks.

	Second, transition from winter schools to civil schools through winter school summaries. During the winter school summary, models were elected, "celebration meetings" were held, "model lists" were posted publicly, and plaques were given to the models, so that the villagers knew the achievements of the winter school, stimulated everyone's enthusiasm and confidence in continuing to learn, and smoothly transitioned winter schools into year-round civil schools. Beiyuan Village in the First District also conducted a "speak bitterness" campaign for illiterate people, which aroused the desire of young and middle-aged women in the village to learn culture.

	Third, civil school learning is closely integrated with production. For example, during the rush to sow, the civil school explained the government's cotton planting policy and arranged discussions. During sowing, Wangquanzhuang Civil School compiled clappers based on the central work and ran mass blackboards, which improved learning and promoted work. Xiaofengzhuang Village explained the warm water seed soaking method in the civil school, and the students took the lead in soaking seeds, while helping to mobilize neighbors to soak seeds. The women's civil school in Jinzhang, the students freely formed groups according to their residences, spinning cotton while studying.

	Fourth, elementary school educators attached importance to adult education ideologically and provided possible assistance to civil schools. For example, teachers at Gu Xin Elementary School determined that a specific person would be responsible for assisting adult education, and went to each street to help civil schools grade homework. Zhang Shunqing, a teacher at Dongzhai Elementary School in the Fourth District, helped village cadres find houses and mobilized villagers to attend school. Under his active mobilization, 32 young people regularly attended civil school to study.

	Fifth, rely on the masses to solve the difficulties of teachers and funding. Most of the civil school teachers were democratically elected from among the intellectuals in the countryside. When teachers had difficulties, the students automatically helped solve them. For example, in order to solve the livelihood difficulties of the teachers in the Gu Xin Village Civil School, everyone automatically cut firewood for him for a day; some villages adopted mutual aid labor exchange methods. In addition to a small portion of funding from the county, the school's funding mainly relied on the masses to solve it themselves. For example, the students of Yangjiazhuang Civil School in the First District collectively cut firewood, Yantou Village organized wage labor, Gu Xin Village collectively engaged in sideline business of weaving mats, and the young people of Fenggang opened up wasteland to grow hemp, preparing the learning expenses.

### 各级领导干部重视农民教育  涉县各村普遍建立民校

　　各级领导干部重视农民教育
    涉县各村普遍建立民校
    【本报讯】河北省涉县全县二百零九个行政村中，已有一百八十一个村建立了常年民校，有的区已做到村村有民校。据五月中旬统计，全县共有大、小民校八百七十一处，参加学习人数共一万六千余名，其中有妇女四千八百余人，年龄较大的失学儿童一千六百余。
    各村民校，均通过民主讨论建立了一定的学习制度：平时分散自学，定期集中上课，有点名、请假、会议、检查、测验等制度。如一区杨树岭村民主订立了民校公约；庄上村规定一星期两次检查，一月一测验，每星期六举行娱乐晚会。各区民校学习已有了显著的成绩。如王全庄民校在二十天内，平均每人认得四十多个字。六区苏刘妇女民校学习了二十一课后，认识生字多的达八十个，平均识字五十八个。
    该县民校工作能够迅速普遍地展开，除了过去农民学习有基础及去年冬学开展较好外，还有下面几个主要因素：
    一、各级领导干部重视民校，党团员积极分子带头学习。该县各区、村的主要干部多数亲自动手搞民校工作。如八区副区长徐贵英亲自布置推动民校工作。他常说：“民校搞不好，成人教育就成问题，没有文化科学知识，做啥也困难。”又如一区庄上村中共支部副书记，晌午不休息到各街亲自检查，并帮助解决校址、课本等问题。
    二、通过冬学总结转入民校。在冬学总结中选举英模，开“庆模会”，当众贴“模范榜”，给模范送匾，使村民知道了冬学的成绩，激发起大家继续学习的热忱与信心，顺利地转冬学为常年民校。一区北原村还进行了文盲诉苦，引起全村青壮年妇女学习文化的要求。
    三、民校学习与生产密切结合。如在突击播种时，民校中便讲政府种棉政策，并布置讨论。王全庄民校在播种时根据中心工作编快板，办大众黑板，提高了学习，又推动了工作。小丰庄村在民校中讲解了温汤浸种方法，学员们首先带头浸种，同时帮助动员邻人浸种。金漳的妇女小民校，学员们按住处自由结组，一面纺花，一面学习。
    四、小学教育工作者在思想上重视了成人教育，予民校以可能的协助。如固新完小教员，确定专人负责协助成人教育，分头到各街帮助民校批改作业。四区东寨小学教员张顺清帮助村干找房子，一面动员村民上学，在他的积极发动下，有三十二个青年经常上民校学习。
    五、依靠群众，解决师资、经费的困难。民校教员多数是从群众中民主推选出来的在乡知识分子。教员有了困难，学员们便自动帮助解决。如固新村小民校为了给教员解决生活困难，大家自动为他割柴一天；有的村则采用互助换工办法。校内经费除县补助一小部分外，主要依靠群众自己解决。如一区杨家庄民校学员集体打柴，沿头村组织卖工，固新村集体搞副业编席子，凤岗青年开生荒种大麻，准备了学习的费用。（杨玉峰、段崇山、张云青）
