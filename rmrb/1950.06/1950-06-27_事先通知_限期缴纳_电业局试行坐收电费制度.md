    Electric Power Bureau Implements Trial System of On-Site Electricity Fee Collection
    [Report from this newspaper] The new fee collection system implemented by the Beijing Electric Power Bureau in the Dongcheng District has shown results, and will be implemented in the Xicheng and Nancheng Districts starting July 1st. In the past, the bureau collected electricity fees using a "door-to-door collection system," meaning that fee collectors were sent to users' homes to collect payments. Because many users did not have the money readily available, only about half were able to pay at the time. For those who could not pay immediately, a notice was left, and the user had to bring the notice to the Electric Power Bureau to pay within seven days and exchange it for an official receipt. To solve this problem and make it more convenient for users, the bureau began a trial "on-site collection system" in the Dongcheng District in April. This meant that meter readers (who regularly visit users' homes each month to read the total electricity consumption from the meter) would notify users of their electricity consumption and the amount due, which could be paid at designated collection stations within seven days. The results of the two-month trial have proven that this system is not only supported by the vast majority of users, but also brings great benefits to national income, the Electric Power Bureau's economic accounting, and work efficiency. In the past, the actual amount of electricity fees collected each month accounted for only 60% to 70% of the amount due, while now, the Dongcheng District can collect more than 99% before the end of the month. For example, in May, out of 30,400 users, only 58 households were unable to pay that month, with the number of households paid accounting for 99.8%, and the amount paid accounting for 99.4%. This system has simple procedures and can save a lot of paper, saving about 4,000 catties of millet for the entire city per month. The stamp tax can also save 17,000 catties of millet. Although the establishment of additional collection stations increased rent and other expenses, the amount is relatively small. A shortcoming in the work was that some comrades worked continuously due to high enthusiasm, and some even became ill from exhaustion. A rotation system and an eight-hour work system were clearly established in mid-May. The above deviations have been improved.

　　事先通知·限期缴纳
    电业局试行坐收电费制度
    【本报讯】北京电业局东城区实行新收费制度已见成绩，西城、南城也将于七月一日起实行。该局过去收取电费采取“走取制度”，即派收费员到用户处去取。因为许多用户的钱并不十分方便，能够当时缴费的不过半数；凡当时不能付款的，就留下一个通知单，再由用户于七日内持此单到电业局缴款，换取正式收据。为了解决此项困难，并便利用户，该局于四月在东城区试行“坐收制度”，即抄表员在抄表时（每月定期到用户处从电表上抄下全月用电度数）通知用户用电度数及电费金额，可于七日内缴到指定的收费站。两个多月的试行结果证明，这一制度不但得到广大用户的拥护，并对国家收入、电业局的经济核算、工作效率上都有极大收获。过去每月实收当月电费金额占应收数不过百分之六十至七十，而现在东城区在当月底前即可收到百分之九十九以上。如五月份三万零四百个用户中，只有五八户没有能够当月缴费，已缴户数占百分之九九·八，以金额计则有百分之九九·四。这一制度，手续简便，可以节省许多纸张，全市全月计可节省约四千斤小米，印花税一项亦可节省一万七千斤小米。虽然因增设了收费站，增加了租金及其他开支，但相较起来是一个很小的数目。工作中的缺点是：由于工作人员热情高涨有些同志连续工作，甚至有人累病了。五月中已明确建立了轮休制度，八小时的工作制度等。上述偏向即得到改进。
