How does the Production Wage Committee Lead Production?

　　In January and February of this year, the Third Factory of Shenyang Machine Tool Plant established production wage committees at all levels through democratic elections. In order to ensure improved product quality and the completion of production tasks, production wage committees at all levels have established regular meeting and reporting systems to promptly grasp the situation and resolve production-related issues. The Production Wage Committee concretely realized the trade union's orientation towards production through the following forms.

　　I. Implementing the Contract System:

　　The collective contracts and connection contracts of the Third Factory of Shenyang Machine Tool Plant began to be piloted in the vigorous New Record Movement in September 1949. The trade union organized workers to formulate detailed production plans for individuals and workshops, and at the same time, represented the workers and signed collective contracts with the administration. The collective bonus method for exceeding the quota was drafted in the contract. In order to ensure the connection of production processes in each workshop, connection contracts between workshops were also formulated. Through collective contracts, the New Record Movement became an organized and planned movement, which also played an organizational, promoting and supervisory role in administrative work. The systems of reports, reporting and work tickets have also been established, opening up a new path for the trade union to face production.

　　II. Formulating Production Charts and Launching Personal Planning:

　　After the monthly task is issued, the workshop production wage committee first checks the accuracy of the drawings to avoid defective products. And take this opportunity to improve workers' ability to view drawings. At the same time, assist foremen and technicians to formulate production schedule tables for each group and assign specific tasks to each group. Then, each group formulates individual task sharing tables and individual production plans according to each person's technical level and the effectiveness of the machine they operate. In this way, you can see the extent to which individuals, groups, and workshops complete tasks, the extent to which they exceed tasks, and the situation of defective products every day.

　　III. Implementing the System of Person-in-Charge and Shift Handover System:

　　According to the experience of the Third Factory, the system of person-in-charge is an indispensable system for managing factories. It enriches the work content of the trade union, and clarifies and strengthens everyone's sense of responsibility, truly forming everyone's management of the factory. Therefore, the factory's production wage committee particularly emphasized the implementation of the person-in-charge system. First, individuals start from themselves, individuals are responsible to the group, and the group is responsible to the branch. Each item in the factory has a wooden sign with the name of the person in charge. If an accident occurs, the person in charge will be held accountable. Each workshop group has formulated guarantee conditions (ie, covenants) according to different tasks, and some have also formulated a "responsibility schedule" which has played a great role in implementing the responsibility system.

　　The shift handover system is for mutual responsibility to explain the situation, so as to avoid damage to the machine and not being able to find a clue.

　　IV. Establishing a Group Inspection System:

　　In order to eliminate defective products, the branch production wage committee organized a workshop inspection group, and the inspection team members were concurrently held by production officers. Since the establishment of the inspection group in the Sixth Working Department, defective products have been reduced rapidly. For example, in February, there were more than 70 pieces of five types of defective products, which were reduced to 11 pieces of two types in March, and only one piece of one type in April.

　　V. Organizing Workshop Technical Research Groups:

　　In order to improve the technical level of employees and solve technical difficulties encountered in production, workshop technical research groups and amateur technical training courses have been organized, which have achieved great results.

　　VI. Red Flag Competition and Defective Product Exhibition:

　　In order to ensure quality and eliminate or reduce defective products, the Production Wage Committee proposed a red flag competition movement in February. In January, a defective product exhibition was held, which greatly educated the workers. Now the factory has turned the exhibition of defective products into a regular education method. Whenever a defective product is produced, the author's name is written on it and placed at the intersection of going to and from work for exhibition, which arouses workers' attention to improving quality. The committee cooperated with the administration to establish a strict inspection system. In April, only one apprentice made a small keyway bad in 5,000 products in six working departments.

　　VII. Organizing Production Visits:

　　Last year, when the New Record Movement was launched, the trade union organized workers to study in the First, Fourth, and Fifth Factories. After returning, they studied each other and strived to catch up with or exceed the achievements of other factories. For example, Zhao Guoyou's car turret, and Dang Huian's car lead screw, both created new records. They also organized mutual visits between workshops. As long as a workshop created a new record or had outstanding features, the blackboard newspaper would praise it in a timely manner, and the small newsletter would be transmitted to each workshop, stimulating everyone's emotions, and organizing visits in a planned way.

　　生产工资委员会怎样领导生产？
    沈阳机器厂第三厂创造了经验
    全国总工会生产部东北工作组
    今年一、二月间，沈阳机器三厂通过民主选举，建立了各级生产工资委员会。为了保证提高产品质量，完成生产任务，各级生产工资委员会都建立了定期的会议汇报制度，及时掌握情况，解决有关生产的问题。生产工资委员会通过下列各种形式，具体地实现了工会面向生产的方针。
    一、推行合同制：
    机器三厂的集体合同和联系合同，在一九四九年九月轰轰烈烈的新纪录运动中，就已开始试行。工会一面组织工人制订个人和车间的周密的生产计划，同时代表工人，同行政签订了集体合同。在合同中，拟订了集体的超额奖励办法。为保证各车间生产工序的衔接，又制订了车间与车间的联系合同。通过集体合同，使新纪录运动成为有组织、有计划的运动，对行政工作也起了组织推动和监督作用。表报、汇报、工票等制度也都建立起来，为工会面向生产开辟了新的道路。
    二、制定生产图表并发动个人订计划：
    每月任务下达后，车间生产工资委员会，首先检查图纸的精确程度，以免出废品。并借此机会，提高工人视图能力。同时，协助工长、技术员制定各小组生产进度表，分配各小组的具体任务。然后由小组根据每个人的技术水平，及所操纵的机器效能，制订个人任务分担表和个人的生产计划。这样，每天可以看出个人、小组及车间完成任务的程度，超过任务的程度，及废品情况。
    三、贯彻专人负责制及交接班制：
    根据三厂的经验，专人负责制是管理工厂不可缺少的制度。它充实了工会的工作内容，并且明确与加强了每个人的责任心，真正形成大家管理工厂。因此，该厂生产工资委员会特别强调贯彻专人负责制。先由个人作起，个人对小组负责，小组对支会负责。该厂每件物品上都挂有木牌，写上负责人的名字，如发生事故，就找负责人追究责任。各车间小组，则根据不同的任务，订出保证条件（即公约），也有的订了“负责进度表”，对贯彻责任制起了很大作用。
    交接班制是为了互相负责交代情况，以免损坏机器和摸不到头绪。
    四、建立小组检查制度：
    为了消灭废品，支会生产工资委员会组织了车间检查小组，检查组员由生产干事兼任。第六工作部自从建立检查小组后，废品很快减少了。如二月份废品有五种七十多件，三月份减到两种十一件，四月份就减到一种一件。
    五、组织车间技术研究小组：
    为了提高职工技术水平，解决生产中遇到的技术困难，组织了车间技术研究小组和业余技术讲习班，收到很大成效。
    六、夺红旗及废品展览：
    生产工资委员会为了保证质量，消灭或减少废品，于二月份提出夺红旗竞赛运动。在一月份，举行废品展览会，对工人教育很大。现该厂已将展览废品变为经常的教育方法。每出一件废品，就写上作者的姓名，放在上下班的路口，进行展览，引起工人对提高质量的注意。委员会配合行政建立了严格的检查制度，到四月份，六个工作部五千件产品中只一个徒工做坏了一个小肖子。
    七、组织生产参观：
    去年开展新纪录运动时，工会组织工人到一、四、五厂学习回来后互相研究争取赶上或超过其他厂的成绩，如赵国有的车塔轮，党会安的车丝杠，都创造了新纪录。他们并组织了车间与车间的互相参观。只要那个车间创造了新纪录，或有突出的地方，黑板报及时表扬，随着小快报传到各车间，激动大家的情绪，并有计划的组织参观。
