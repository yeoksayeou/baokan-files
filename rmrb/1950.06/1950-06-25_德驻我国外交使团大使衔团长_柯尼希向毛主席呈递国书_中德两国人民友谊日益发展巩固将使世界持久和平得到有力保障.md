　　Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic to Our Country, Ambassador Koenig, Presents Credentials to Chairman Mao
　　The Growing and Consolidating Friendship Between the Chinese and German Peoples Will Provide a Strong Guarantee for Lasting World Peace
　　[Xinhua News Agency, June 24th] The head of the diplomatic mission of the German Democratic Republic to our country, Ambassador Koenig, accompanied by Counselor Gruttner, Commercial Counselor Dürber, Third Counselor Rosemeier, Second Secretary Mrs. Gruttner, Third Secretary Heroth, and Third Secretary Stieler, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of our country at 6:00 PM today. Present were Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government; Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government; Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Wang Bingnan, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Yu Xinqing, Director of the Bureau of Protocol of the Central People's Government; and Wang Zhuoru, Director of the Department of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. When presenting his credentials, Ambassador Koenig delivered a eulogy to Chairman Mao Zedong, and Chairman Mao Zedong delivered a reply.
　　Ambassador Koenig's eulogy is as follows:
Your Excellency Chairman:
　　I am deeply honored to be appointed as the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China. Your Excellency Chairman, I extend to you and the great Chinese people the sincere greetings of the President, Government, and all the people of the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, I express my heartfelt congratulations to you for the rapid and successful progress of China's construction undertakings, which the new China has been striving for after defeating the combined forces of foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries, and which will ensure the Chinese people a free, prosperous, happy, and brilliant future.
　　The Germany that I have the honor to represent is a new Germany that has completely broken away from the imperialist policy of violent conquest and war pursued under the rule of monopoly capitalists, large landowners, and militarists, which has twice plunged the world into the disaster of war. Thanks to the heroic and glorious Soviet army for crushing the Hitler state, it opened up a new path for the German people to work for peace and happiness on a truly democratic basis. Thanks to the selfless assistance and support of the Soviet Union, the capitalist monopoly and landlord rule were eliminated in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, and the foundation of imperialism completely collapsed. Furthermore, the establishment of an anti-fascist and democratic order completely blocked the path of imperialist and fascist restoration.
　　The establishment of the German Democratic Republic on the basis of an anti-fascist and democratic order is a turning point not only in German history but also in the history of Europe as a whole. The German Democratic Republic is a strong and secure foundation for the entire German people's struggle for a unified and peaceful national existence. This struggle is against the division of Germany and turning its western part into a colony of foreign imperialism, and against the imperialist war-mongers and their running dogs. These enemies of peace are seizing West Germany and incorporating it into their war bloc, turning it into a battlefield and war supplier for their planned attacks on the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Therefore, the German people's struggle for genuine national interests and unified independence, and the peace-loving and democratic Germany's struggle, is a strong part of the great world camp that upholds peace, opposes imperialist war-mongers, and strives for the happiness of all mankind under the leadership of the Soviet Union.
　　The recognition of the German Democratic Republic by the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the two countries' diplomatic relations have been greeted with great joy and satisfaction by the peace-loving German people. All truly patriotic people of the nation are watching with infinite admiration the great Chinese people, under your leadership—Your Excellency Chairman—victoriously completing the people's revolution, causing world imperialism to suffer the most serious defeat since the smashing of the Hitler gang. At the same time, it has greatly strengthened the struggle of the great world anti-imperialist front for peace and democracy. The victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle has further helped the German people strengthen their confidence that the German national survival struggle will also achieve final victory with the help and support of the peace-loving people of the world.
　　The establishment of diplomatic relations between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China is a decisive turning point in the mutual relations between the two peoples. This is in line with the principle of the German Democratic Republic's foreign policy, which is to establish our diplomatic relations on the basis of mutual respect, complete equality, and close friendship.
　　My task and my sincere wish is to use this principle as the guideline for all my work. I am confident, Your Excellency Chairman, that the work of the diplomatic mission of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China, and the future work of the diplomatic mission of the People's Republic of China to the German Democratic Republic, lies in establishing closer friendly relations and cooperation between the two peoples, not only promoting the common interests of the two peoples, but also further strengthening the camp for peace, progress, and happiness of all nations under the leadership of the Soviet Union worldwide.
　　Chairman Mao's reply is as follows:
Your Excellency Head of Mission:
　　I am very pleased to accept the credentials of the President of the German Democratic Republic presented by Your Excellency, and I thank Your Excellency for your warm congratulations.
　　Since the great Soviet army smashed Hitler's reactionary state apparatus, the Chinese people have been happily watching the development of the German people's democratic movement. Since the new Germany, the German Democratic Republic, was established under the leadership of Your Excellency President Wilhelm Pieck, and since this has become a turning point in German history and European history, the Chinese people have been even more happy, feeling that they have gained a very good and strong friend. It is precisely at this time that the People's Republic of China has been established and the Chinese people's revolution has achieved national victory, and our country and your country have quickly established diplomatic relations. There is no doubt that the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries will not only make the friendship between our two peoples grow and consolidate day by day, but will also provide a strong guarantee for lasting world peace.
　　I warmly welcome Your Excellency to take office as the head of the diplomatic mission of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to assist Your Excellency in strengthening the cooperation between the two countries.
　　I wish your country prosperity and your people well-being, and I wish your head of state good health.

　　德驻我国外交使团大使衔团长
    柯尼希向毛主席呈递国书
    中德两国人民友谊日益发展巩固将使世界持久和平得到有力保障
    【新华社二十四日讯】德意志民主共和国驻我国外交使团大使衔团长柯尼希于今日下午六时偕参赞葛鲁特纳，商务参赞杜尔伯，第三参赞罗斯迈色，二等秘书葛鲁特纳夫人，三等秘书何若德，三等秘书施悌勒，向我国中央人民政府毛泽东主席呈递国书。在场的有中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠，中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来，中国人民解放军代总参谋长聂荣臻，外交部办公厅主任王炳南，中央人民政府典礼局局长余心清，外交部交际处处长王倬如。柯尼希团长呈递国书时曾向毛泽东主席致颂词，毛泽东主席致答词。
  柯尼希团长的颂词如下：主席阁下：
    我被任为德意志民主共和国派驻中华人民共和国的大使，感到万分荣幸。主席阁下，我向您和伟大的中国人民转达德意志民主共和国总统、政府和全体人民的热诚敬礼。同时对于中国建设事业迅速而成功的进行，向您表示衷心的祝贺，这事业是新中国在击败外国帝国主义和国内反动派的联合力量取得伟大胜利以后所积极努力的，并且它将保证中国人民有一个自由繁荣和幸福灿烂的将来。
    我荣幸的所代表的德国是一个新德国，它彻底摆脱了垄断资本家、大地主和军国主义者统治下所推行的暴力征服的战争的帝国主义政策，这政策曾两次使世界陷入战争的灾难。感谢英勇而光荣的苏军粉碎了希特勒国家，给德国人民开辟了一条在真正民主基础上为和平幸福而工作的新道路。由于苏联大公无私的帮助和支持，在德国的苏军占领区，肃清了资本主义的垄断和地主统治，帝国主义的基础就完全崩溃了。并且因为反法西斯民主秩序的建立，彻底阻塞了帝国主义和法西斯复辟的道路。
    在反法西斯和民主秩序基础上德意志民主共和国的建立，不仅是德国历史同时也是整个欧洲历史的转折点。德意志民主共和国是全德人民争取统一和平的民族生存中的坚强和安全的基础。这个斗争是反对割裂德国并把它的西部变成外国帝国主义殖民地、反对帝国主义战争贩子及其走狗们的斗争。这些和平的敌人，正在抓紧西德编入他们的战争集团，并把它变成他们计划进攻苏联及人民民主国家的战场和战争供给者。因此德国人民为了真正的民族利益和统一独立，爱好和平的民主德国的斗争，是在苏联领导下拥护和平、反对帝国主义战争贩子、争取全人类幸福的伟大世界阵营斗争的坚强的一部分。
    中华人民共和国对德意志民主共和国的承认和两国外交关系的建立，受到爱好和平的德国人民非常愉快和满意的祝贺。所有真实民族的爱国人民，都以无限的敬慕注视着在您——主席阁下——领导下伟大的中国人民胜利的完成了人民革命，使世界帝国主义遭受到从希特勒匪帮被粉碎以来最严重的失败。同时大大加强了争取和平民主的伟大世界反帝战线的斗争。中国人民解放斗争的胜利，更帮助德国人民加强了信心，德国民族生存斗争在全世界爱好和平人民的帮助和支持之下，也将获得最后的胜利。
    德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国外交关系的建立，是两国人民相互关系上有决定意义的转折点。这正符合于德意志民主共和国外交政策的原则，在互相尊重，完全平等和亲密友好的基础上来建立我们的外交关系。
    我的任务和我衷心的愿望，就是把这个原则，作为我全部工作的准绳。我确信，主席阁下，德意志民主共和国派驻中华人民共和国外交使团以及将来中华人民共和国派驻德意志民主共和国外交使团的工作，在于更加紧密建立两国人民的友好关系和合作，不仅促进两国人民彼此的共同利益，同时也进一步加强在苏联领导下全世界范围内争取各民族和平进步与幸福的阵营。
  毛主席的答词如下：团长阁下：
    我很高兴地接受贵团长呈递的德意志民主共和国总统的国书，并感谢贵团长的热忱祝贺。
    自从伟大的苏军粉碎了希特勒的反动的国家机构以后，中国人民就高兴地注视着德国人民民主运动的发展。自从新德国德意志民主共和国，在贵国总统威廉·皮克先生领导之下建立起来，即此就成为德国历史和欧洲历史的转折点以后，中国人民就更加高兴，感觉自己增加了一个很好的和有力的朋友。恰好在这种时候，中华人民共和国已经建立，中国人民革命已经获得了全国的胜利，我国和贵国就迅速地建立了外交关系。毫无疑义，贵我两国外交关系的建立，不但将使贵我两国人民之间的友谊日益发展与巩固，并且将使世界持久和平得到强有力的保障。
    我热烈地欢迎阁下出任德意志民主共和国驻中华人民共和国外交使团的大使衔的团长，并愿对贵团长加强两国合作的工作，予以协助。
    谨祝贵国国家繁荣，人民兴旺，并祝贵国元首健康。
