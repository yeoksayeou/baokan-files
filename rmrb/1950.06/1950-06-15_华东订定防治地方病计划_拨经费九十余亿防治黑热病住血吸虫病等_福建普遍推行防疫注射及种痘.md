(Shanghai News) *Jiefang Daily* reported that the East China Military and Political Committee approved the Department of Health's plan for the prevention and control of endemic diseases at its 16th administrative meeting held on the 6th of this month. The main tasks of this plan are to prevent and control Kala-azar, schistosomiasis, and plague. This year's funding is 6 million *jin* of rice, equivalent to over 9.2 billion yuan, and prevention and control work will be carried out in a planned manner. Kala-azar is prevalent throughout Shandong Province, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui, with more than one million people affected. In addition to the Kala-azar Prevention and Control General Office already established in Tai'an, Shandong, branch offices will be established in Jiaodong, central and southern Shandong, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu. The tasks of each office are to investigate the situation of Kala-azar and study methods of collective treatment and diagnosis. Schistosomiasis is distributed in southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, and most areas of Zhejiang, as well as small parts of Fujian and Taiwan, with 3 to 5 million patients, mostly farmers. Without treatment, the mortality rate is around 90%. In the most severely affected areas, it often leads to the disappearance of human habitation and the abandonment of farmland. A Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control General Office has been established in southern Jiangsu, and branch offices have been established in southern Anhui and Zhejiang. Plague is prevalent year-round in Fujian, with eleven counties in southeastern Fujian, one county in central Fujian, and two counties in northern Fujian experiencing recurring outbreaks. Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Quzhou areas in Zhejiang Province also experienced outbreaks after the Japanese invaders spread plague germs during the Anti-Japanese War. A Plague Prevention and Control General Office has now been established in Fuzhou, and a branch office will be established in Wenzhou in the near future, and mobile epidemic prevention teams will be set up in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 11th: Since the beginning of spring this year, epidemic infectious diseases such as smallpox, malignant malaria, and plague have been commonly found in coastal counties of Fujian Province and villages along important transportation lines in northern Fujian. With the assistance of the epidemic prevention team of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Provincial People's Government has organized epidemic prevention teams stationed in Jinjiang, Longxi, Jianyang and other regions, and cooperated with health agencies, public and private hospitals, and medical school teachers and students at all levels to establish health institutions at all levels and universally carry out epidemic prevention work; and organized mobile epidemic prevention teams to rush to areas where the epidemic is rampant to rescue those suffering from the epidemic. At present, the spread of the epidemic has been contained in more than 20 counties including Jinjiang and Tongan. Under the leadership of the Provincial Health Department, various counties have universally carried out injections of various disease prevention vaccines and vaccinations in March and April. The Provincial Health Department issued 36,468 dozen smallpox vaccines, 3,775,600 cc of plague vaccine, and 1,944,900 cc of cholera-typhoid mixed vaccine to various cities and counties. Eighty percent of the citizens of Fuzhou have been vaccinated against plague. The city is also carrying out a large-scale rat and flea extermination campaign. In Xiamen, 136 health organizations have been established in various agencies, schools, and suburban areas, vaccinating over 98,800 people and injecting over 121,000 people with plague vaccine, accounting for over 73% of the city's population. During the epidemic prevention campaign, primary and secondary school teachers and students and people's broadcasting stations were mobilized to carry out extensive publicity and education work, breaking the superstitious ideas of the masses and enabling the epidemic prevention campaign to be widely carried out.
