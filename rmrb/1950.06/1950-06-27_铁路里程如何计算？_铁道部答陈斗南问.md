　　How is Railway Mileage Calculated?
    The Ministry of Railways Answers Chen Dounan's Question
Editor:
    Recently, the mileage tables for each station produced by the Tianjin Railway Bureau differ from the distances previously seen. For example, on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the distance from Beijing to Xushui station was previously 122 kilometers, but now it is 131 kilometers, a difference of 9 kilometers. I wonder why? I hope to receive an answer.

Mr. Chen Dounan:
    The Central People's Government's Ministry of Railways answers your question as follows:
    The position of some stations on newly restored lines is slightly different from before, so the section mileage is also different. Generally, railway mileage is calculated using two methods: engineering mileage (calculated by accumulating the actual mileage of each station) and operating mileage (i.e., for the remaining distance between two stations that is less than one kilometer, the tail end is rounded off according to the rounding method to form a whole mileage unit). Therefore, the operating mileage and engineering mileage of a line may sometimes differ by two or three li. Secondly, because some starting stations are different from the past, such as the Beijing-Hankou Line, which previously started from Beijing West Station, but now starts from Beijing East Station. Therefore, the number of kilometers in the section is also different.

　　铁路里程如何计算？
    铁道部答陈斗南问编者：
    近来天津铁路局所制的各站里程表，与往日见过的各站距离里数有不同处。如京汉路北京至徐水站，从前是一二二公里，现在则是一三一公里，相差九公里。不知何故？望予答复。
          陈斗南陈斗南君：
    你的问题，由中央人民政府铁道部答复如下：
    新修复线路上的某些车站，因位置与从前稍有不同，所以区间里程亦有不同。一般铁路里程是依据工程里程（按实际各站里程累计计算）和营业里程（即两站间的里程不满一公里的尾数按四舍五入办法进整，作一个里程单位）两种办法计算。因此一个线的营业里程与工程里程有时可能相差二、三里。其次，因为某些起算站与过去不同，如京汉线从前是由北京西站为起点，而现在则由北京东站为起点。因此区间公里数也就不同。
