　　Thoroughly Investigate Bureaucratic Work Style
　　Jinan Station Establishes Management Committee
　　[This newspaper's Jinan dispatch] The leading cadres of the Jinan Railway Administration's Jinan Station have serious bureaucracy, which has led to continuous accidents and a gradual decline in the quality of work. After the Jinan Railway Bureau's assistance, the anti-bureaucracy struggle and the strengthening of democratic management are underway.
　　Last September, the percentage of trains delayed by the station was 27%, which increased to 61% by December. Among these, the number of trains delayed due to station responsibility increased from 17 in October to 70 in December. Last October, the freight car dwell time at the station was 25 hours, which increased to 32 hours in December; at the same time, the transfer time also increased from 6 hours to 9.5 hours. There was one accident in both September and October of last year, but this increased to five in December. In view of this, the Political Department and the Trade Union of the Jinan Railway Bureau sent people in February this year to assist the station in carrying out democratic management education. After a long period of study and preparation, the thinking of the leadership has improved compared to before, and the employees have a clearer understanding of democratic management. As a result, the station's employees put forward more than 200 written opinions on transportation suggestions and leadership aspects at separate group meetings.
　　On this basis, the station held its first employee representative meeting on the 2nd of this month. The leading cadres focused on reviewing the serious shortcomings of neglecting to mobilize the masses in the past, which caused losses in work. At the same time, it called on all employees to launch strict criticism and self-criticism to eliminate all bureaucratic work styles. After the election at the meeting, a management committee was established. The management committee has now begun to study ways to improve work.

　　深入检查官僚主义作风
    济南站成立管委会
    【本报济南讯】济南铁路管理局济南站的领导干部，存在着严重的官僚主义，以致曾不断发生事故，工作质量逐渐降低；经济南路局帮助后，反官僚主义斗争和加强民主管理工作正在进行中。
    去年九月份，该站晚开列车为百分之二十七，至十二月份增为百分之六十一。其中因车站责任而晚开的列车，由十月份的十七列增至十二月份的七十列。去年十月份，该站货车停留时间为二十五小时，至十二月增为三十二小时；同时中转时间亦由六小时增为九·五小时。责任事故在去年九、十月份各一次，十二月却增为五次。济南路局政治部和工会有鉴于此，特于今年二月派人协助该站进行民主管理教育，经过长时间的学习和酝酿，领导思想已较前提高，员工对民主管理亦有较明确的认识，因而该站职工在分别召开的小组会议上，提出了有关运输建议和领导方面的书面意见共二百余条。
    在此基础上，该站于本月二日召开了第一次职工代表会议，领导干部着重检讨了过去忽视发动群众，使工作遭受损失的严重缺点。同时并号召全体职工展开严格的批评和自我批评，铲除一切官僚主义的作风。会上经过选举，成立了管理委员会。现在管委会已开始研究改善工作的办法。
