　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has issued a statement protesting MacArthur's illegal atrocities, such as "purging" all members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. The statement said: The heinous actions of MacArthur, the executor of American imperialism in Japan, and the Japanese Yoshida puppet government have undisguisedly destroyed the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration and seriously threatened world peace. This is a concrete manifestation of the American imperialism suppressing democratic forces in Japan and preparing for a new war. The growing patriotic movement of the Japanese people has severely struck the evil attempts of American imperialism to turn Japan into a colony and military base and the traitorous policies of the Yoshida puppet government. Precisely because of this, the American and Japanese reactionaries have had to intensify their attacks on the Japanese Communist Party and adopt bloody means to suppress the democratic movement of the Japanese people. We lodge a serious protest against this crime of the American and Japanese reactionaries. We fully support the just stance of Tokuda and 23 other members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, the staff of the *Akahata* newspaper, and Ting Tao Keji and 16 other members of the Japanese Communist Party Diet, as well as other Japanese patriots, and oppose the conspiracy of the American reactionary rulers to prepare for a new war of aggression. We firmly believe that the power of the people of the world can surely stop the evil attempts of the warmongers.

　　中华全国文联发表声明  抗议麦克阿瑟非法暴行
    【新华社十三日讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会顷对麦克阿瑟非法“整肃”日本共产党中央委员会全体委员等项暴行发表声明表示抗议。声明称：美国帝国主义者在日本的执行人麦克阿瑟和日本吉田傀儡政府这些罪恶行动，已毫无掩饰地毁灭了波茨坦宣言的精神，而严重地威胁着世界的和平。这正是美帝国主义镇压日本民主势力，准备新战争的具体表现。日益壮大的日本人民的爱国运动，业已严重地打击了美帝变日本为殖民地与军事基地的罪恶企图和吉田傀儡政府的卖国政策。正由于此，美日反动派不得不变本加厉地向日本共产党进攻，并采取了镇压日本人民的民主运动的血腥手段。我们对于美日反动派此种罪行，提出严重的抗议。我们全力支持日共中委德田等二十四人及《赤旗报》职员和日共众议员听涛克已等十七人以及其他日本爱国分子的正义立场，反对美国反动统治者准备新侵略战争的阴谋。我们深信全世界人民的力量一定可以制止战争贩子的罪恶企图。
