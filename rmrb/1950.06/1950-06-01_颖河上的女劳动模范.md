　　Female Labor Model on the Ying River
    Duan Peiming
    "Dig the Ying River, sweat more; protect the crops from flooding." "Our own business, we'll do it ourselves, strive to be a model and a hero." This is the loud cheer of the 70,000 laborers on the banks of the Ying River. It encourages the laborers to contribute their strength to this huge project.
    Zhan Mo, a member of the Young Women's League, is one of the labor models of the Ying River project. She is from Chengguan District, Xihua, Henan Province, and is eighteen years old this year. Her body does not seem very strong; but when she starts working, she is the same as a man. She carries a full basket of mud, strides up the slope to the riverbank. She can carry an average of 160 baskets a day, with a total round trip of eighty li. She persists in the same way on rainy days, until the final completion. At the second merit evaluation meeting, she won the Model Medal.
    Zhan Mo was originally the daughter of a tenant farmer and grew up eating bitterness. One year, her father developed sores and became ill, unable to move. The family's livelihood depended entirely on Zhan Mo alone. Before dawn, she would pick up a carrying pole, sickle, and rope, and go to cut grass thirty li away. She had to cut eighty jin of grass every day and carry it to the market to exchange for grain. Under the tempering of this kind of life, she could do everything from carrying on her shoulders, lifting by hand, pulling plows, and hoeing the fields, just like a young man.
    When she was carrying earth on the banks of the Ying River, she would not ask to change shoulders when the male workers did not rest. In rainy days, rain pouring down from above and sliding below, she did not fall behind others. She said, "If there are difficulties, the Young Women's League members should be models and lead everyone to work." Under her influence, all the villagers insisted on working even on rainy days. When water was dug out from the bottom of the river and mud had to be scooped out of the water, she immediately rolled up her trousers and jumped into the water, taking a hoe to shovel the mud. Her father ran over to ask her to go back and rest for a few days, but she resolutely refused to go back, waiting until the river project was completed before returning home.
    When Zhan Mo came off shift from the construction site, she never liked to be idle. She was either twisting hemp rope or sewing up the worn-out mud sacks. When everyone went to eat, she stayed behind to watch the furniture, she would shovel basket after basket of earth, or take the mud cloth sacks to the water to wash them clean. When she came back from eating, she would first sweep the meal area clean and carry two buckets of boiling water to the kitchen. Everyone praised her, saying, "Zhan Mo is neither lazy nor slippery, and her hands and feet are nimble and diligent." But she herself never boasted in front of people, let alone showed off her merits in front of people, just working silently and tirelessly all day long.

### 颖河上的女劳动模范

　　颖河上的女劳动模范
    段佩明
    “挖颖河，多流汗；保护庄稼不受淹”。“自己事，自己干，争取模范当好汉。”这是颖河岸上七万民工们响亮的欢呼。它鼓舞着民工们为这个巨大工程而贡献自己的力量。
    女青年团员展墨是颖河河工劳动模范之一。她是河南省西华城关区人，今年十八岁。她的身体看来并不多么结实；可是干起活来，却同男子一样。她担起满筐泥土，迈步上坡直到河堤。每天平均可担一六○筐，来往路程合计八十里。阴雨天她也同样坚持，直到最后完工。第二次评功会上，她获得了模范奖章。
    展墨，原是佃户的女儿，自幼吃苦长大的。有一年，她爹爹生疮患病，不能行动了。一家人的生活，就全靠展墨一人来维持。天没亮，她就拿起扁担、镰刀、绳子，到三十里以外去割草。每天要割上八十斤草，挑到集市上换粮米。在这种生活的锻炼下，她肩担手提，拉犁锄地，样样都行，像个年青汉子。
    当她在颖河岸上抬土时，男工不休息，她也不提换肩。在下雨天，上淋下滑，她也没落到人后边。她说：“有了困难，青年团员，要作模范，领着大家干。”在她的影响下，全村民工，在雨天里也坚持工作。当河底挖出水来，要到水中捞泥的时候，她便立刻卷起裤腿，跳进水去，拿铣去铲泥。她爹跑来要换她回去歇几天，她坚决不回去，等河工完成再回家。
    展墨从工地上换班下来，总不喜欢闲着，不是搓麻绳线，便是缝补那磨破了的泥兜。当大家都去吃饭，她留下来看家具时，她便铲满一筐一筐的土，或者将泥布兜拿到水里洗干净。在她去吃饭回来的时候，先把饭场打扫干净，并到伙房去担二桶开水。大家都夸她说：“展墨一不偷懒，二不滑，手脚伶俐、勤快。”但她自己从没在人前骄傲过，更没在人前逞过功，只是一天到晚默默地、不知疲倦地工作着。
