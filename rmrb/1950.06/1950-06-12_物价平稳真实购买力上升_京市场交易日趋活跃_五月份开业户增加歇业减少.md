[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Beijing market prices, which had been falling in March and April, have stabilized since May, and market transactions have become more active. The mood of industrialists and merchants to operate has improved significantly. This is because: 1. The People's Government has taken a series of necessary measures to adjust industry and commerce; 2. The central government has correctly grasped price policy; 3. Real purchasing power has increased slightly.

In terms of prices, although May was still slightly lower than April, from the perspective of the wholesale prices of 26 major commodities, the decline from the beginning to the end of the month was only 2.13%, and the magnitude was not too large. The listing and transaction volume of the two major commodities, grain and cotton cloth, in various exchanges have also increased. The amount of grain listed in May was over 138 million jin, and the transaction volume was over 35 million jin. The transaction volume accounted for 25.59% of the listed volume, a slight increase compared to 24.83% in April. The transaction volume of cloth in May was over 56,700 bolts, an increase of 30.05% compared to over 43,600 bolts in April.

In terms of prices, state-owned specialized companies still maintain a policy of listing prices higher than market prices, which not only stabilizes prices but also leaves a large sales market for private merchants. For example, in May, state-owned enterprises accounted for 14.30% of the grain transaction volume, while private merchants accounted for 81.96%. Private merchants accounted for 96.49% of the cloth transaction volume, and 86.31% of the yarn transaction volume.

In terms of the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, there has also been a slight improvement in May. More than 50 million jin of grain were imported, an increase of 27.03% compared to April; more than 10 million jin of grain were exported, an increase of 42.77% compared to April. More than 14,000 bolts of cloth were exported, an increase of 82.91% compared to April.

Under the above-mentioned new circumstances, coupled with the fact that the People's Government's measures to adjust the relationship between public and private industry and commerce are continuing to be implemented, the operating sentiment of Beijing's industrialists and merchants has improved significantly. This is clearly reflected in the number of commercial openings and closures in May: In May, 288 households applied to open businesses, an increase of 52 households compared to April; 482 households applied to close businesses, a decrease of 256 households compared to April. The ratio of closures to openings was three to one in April, but had decreased to one to one in late May. In addition, eight households whose applications for closure had already been approved by the Commerce Bureau voluntarily requested to withdraw their applications for closure.

　　物价平稳真实购买力上升
    京市场交易日趋活跃
    五月份开业户增加歇业减少
    【京市新闻处讯】京市物价自五月份起已由三、四月的下落而趋向平稳，市场交易亦形活跃，工商业者经营的情绪显著提高。这是因为：一、人民政府对调整工商业采取了一系列的必要措施；二、中央对物价政策的正确掌握；三、真实购买力已稍有增加。
    在物价方面，五月份虽比四月份仍稍低，但从二十六种主要商品批发价上来看，月末比月初下落仅百分之二·一三，幅度已不太大。各交易所粮食、纱布两种主要商品的上市与成交量也都有增加。五月份粮食上市量为一亿三千八百多万斤，成交量为三千五百余万斤，成交量占上市量的百分之二五·五九，较四月份的百分之二四·八三稍有增加。五月份的成交量为五万六千七百多匹，较四月份的四万三千六百多匹已增加百分之三○·○五。
    在价格上，国营专营公司仍维持牌价高于市价的政策，不但能稳定物价，并给私商留下很大的销售市场。如五月份粮食的成交量，公商占百分之十四·三○；而私商占到百分之八一·九六。布的成交量，私商占到百分之九六·四九；纱的成交量，私商占百分之八六·三一。
    在城乡物资交流方面，五月份亦已稍见起色。粮食输入五千余万斤，较四月份增加百分之二七·○三；粮食输出一千余万斤，较四月份增加百分之四二·七七。布输出一万四千余匹，较四月份增加百分之八二·九一。
    在如上的一些新情况下，加上人民政府对调整公私工商业关系的一些措施正在继续贯彻执行，京市工商业者经营情绪已有显著提高。这明显表现在五月份商业开业歇业数字上：五月份申请开业的有二八八户，较四月份增多五二户；申请歇业的四八二户，较四月份减少二五六户。而歇业与开业的比例，四月份是三比一，五月下旬则已减为一比一了。并有已经商业局批准歇业的八户，又自动提出撤销歇业申请。
