　　The Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers' Statement Points Out:
    The Fate of the American Imperialist Bandits Will Be the Same as Hitler's
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers issued a statement on the 29th denouncing the American imperialist acts of aggression. The statement is as follows:
    President Truman's statement on the 27th of this month is a challenge declaring the destruction of world peace and aggression against the people and nations of Asia. He tore up the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Agreement, and the United Nations Charter. His actions, which disregard international credibility, are the same as those of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo. He will inevitably arouse the anger and resistance of all Asian people and the people of the world, including the American people. In the end, the warmongers of American imperialism will head towards the same fate as Hitler and others.
    Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, issued a great call at the eighth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee: "The people of the whole country and the world unite and make full preparations to defeat any provocation by American imperialism." This demonstrates an overwhelming force. The 475 million people of China will unanimously rally under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to carry out a heroic struggle to defend peace, defend democracy, oppose aggression, and oppose imperialism.
    Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn and righteous statement on the 28th of this month, on behalf of the Central People's Government of China, pointed out that Truman's statement and the actions of the U.S. Navy are armed aggression against us; all our people will liberate Taiwan from the hands of the U.S. aggressors. This is unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, and we will accept this call with resolute action.

　　农工民主党的声明指出：
    美帝强盗的命运将和希特勒一样
    【本报讯】中国农工民主党于二十九日发表声明斥美帝侵略行为。声明如下：
    美国杜鲁门总统，本月二十七日的声明，是一篇宣告破坏世界和平和侵略亚洲人民和国家的挑战书。他撕毁了开罗会议宣言、波茨坦协定和联合国宪章。他这等不顾国际信义的举动，是与希特勒、墨索里尼和东条等的行为相同的。他必然会激起全亚洲人民和全世界人民包括美国人民在内的愤怒和反抗。最后的结果，是美帝国主义的战争贩子走向希特勒等同一的命运。
    中国人民领袖毛主席，在中央人民政府委员会第八次会议上，所发出的伟大的号召：“全国和全世界的人民团结起来，进行充分的准备，打败美帝国主义的任何挑衅。”这表现着排山倒海的力量，中国四万万七千五百万人民，将一致的集结在中国共产党和毛主席的旗帜之下，为保卫和平、保卫民主、反对侵略、反对帝国主义，而进行英勇的斗争。
    周外长于本月二十八日，代表中国中央人民政府所发表的义正辞严的声明，指出杜鲁门的声明，和美国海军的行动，是对我武装侵略；我全体人民，必将从美侵略者手中，解放台湾。这是全国人民一致拥护的，并将以坚决的行动，来接受这个号召。
