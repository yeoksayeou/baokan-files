How to Use Literary Works for Propaganda and Education?
	Wu Xiaowu

Editor's Note: Our literature, drama, film, music, and art serve the people, first and foremost the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They should enlighten the people's political consciousness, encourage the people's labor enthusiasm, and cultivate the people's new morality, so as to promote their great function of educating the people. On the one hand, we require that every literary and artistic work has this kind of content. On the other hand, we require that activists among the people, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and staff members of the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army, systematically and organizedly publicize these works among the masses of people, and organize reading, recitation, performance, and discussion in factories, rural areas, troops, and schools. This article was originally published in the 39th issue of "China Youth." Comrade Wu Xiaowu, based on personal experience, pointed out the role of this kind of literary and art propaganda and provided concrete methods. We believe that these experiences and methods are worth referring to, adopting, and promoting by propaganda and education workers.

In the summer of 1945, I was doing education work in the Zhangjiakou Railway Factory. There was a young technician inside named Wang Chunnian, who was neither very active nor very backward among the workers; however, he liked to read novels very much. Once, he read the famous Soviet writer Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered." After reading it, he wrote a "Reflections After Reading"; I remember one sentence in it said: "I am determined to be a second Paul Kochakin (the hero in the book)." From then on, he became more and more active in production and study day by day. Soon, the enemy attacked Zhangjiakou, and our army took the initiative to withdraw. Wang Chunnian carried his rifle and followed us. In the course of the march, he behaved very resolutely. He carried with him the Soviet writer Birventsev's "The Test," and whenever he had time, he would read it. He said: He had already read it twice. Often while marching, he would tell the stories in the book to the other workers. He said: "Our retreat is also for the sake of attack, in order to more effectively eliminate the enemy, and soon we will fight back to Zhangjiakou!" His luggage was very simple, but he carried a set of fitter's tools. Obviously, his thoughts and actions were influenced by these two books. After arriving at the old base area, he became an activist in the construction of the factory, and soon he joined the Communist Party. Of course, it cannot be said that his progress was entirely due to reading these two novels. But at least it can be said that these revolutionary and excellent literary works produced a positive effect on this young man; it became one of the important factors in his progress.

I myself am a young man from a petty-bourgeois family. My participation in the revolution initially came from reading Gorky's "My Childhood." This book broadened my horizons. It turned out that there were so many people and lives in the world that I had never heard of or seen before. Then I read some other revolutionary literary works. These works, in today's view, even have some unhealthy things, but they inspired my imagination and gave me the courage to explore new lives and resist the dark society. At that time, they played a certain positive role.

As far as I know, some young people and intellectuals of my era initially participated in the revolution because they were influenced by revolutionary literary works. But at that time, I thought that this was not necessarily the case for the workers and peasants. Since I discovered something similar to this in Wang Chunnian, my views have changed, making me more deeply aware of the brilliant point that "Literature and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers."

In the winter of 1947, I participated in the land reform work in Mafucai Village, Ding County, Hebei Province. When celebrating the Lunar New Year in the village, work was stopped for four days. There were several storytellers in the village who took this opportunity to tell stories of "Water Margin," "Little Eight Righteous Men," "Investiture of the Gods"... There were many listeners who were very interested, and would not leave late at night. Compared with my usual preaching-style propaganda to the masses in the village, it was really enviable. This inspired me to change my relatively boring preaching-style propaganda method and try to use literary works to conduct propaganda and education to farmers in the form of storytelling. I have read many novels and have also received a period of actor training; so this is not very difficult for me. Aiming at the problems existing in the farmers' minds at that time, I decided on the content of the propaganda. For example: Why can the peasant movement only be victorious with the leadership of the Communist Party? Why must we step up production after land reform in order to have enough food and clothing? According to these questions, I chose literary works that could answer these questions. However, in the literary works I have read, there are no works that can completely solve these problems. So I combined the content of several works, such as "The White-Haired Girl", "Clear Sky", "Changes in Li Family Village", "Blood Corpse Case", "Li Youcai's Rhymes", "Night Pearl", "Blood and Tears of Hatred"... and added some of my own "creations," drew up an outline, and compiled a book called "Bittersweet." I also learned from the storytellers: the tone has high and low pitches, expressions, and actions... and started telling it to the farmers. I told it for two days and two nights. Without knocking on gongs to gather people, nor sending people to call door to door, the number of listeners increased. During the lecture, no one slipped away or fell asleep! Obviously, it was more popular than my speech. Later, whenever there was a meeting, they always asked me to tell a story first. Moreover, when they were debating a question, they often cited examples from "Bittersweet."

Last winter, I went to the No. 2 Textile Factory in Tianjin to help with the "Worker Study Class." Most of the people participating in this "Study Class" were slow in production and thought. At the beginning, I gave a few lessons on "Social Development History," which was really a bit out of tune. Even the order of the classroom was difficult to maintain, and people seemed unbearable to "listen." I immediately changed my approach. I found Comrade Ding Kexin's popular long story: "Three Brothers." The three brothers are all workers. The eldest is a so-called "law-abiding" person in the old society, who is afraid of breaking his head even if a leaf falls from the tree. He only endures the persecution of the oppressors and does not dare to resist, and finally dies tragically. The second is the opposite: irritable, whoever dares to poke him, he will fight him desperately... He is somewhat impulsive, so he has hit the wall several times, and then takes risks, sacrificing his life without any value. The third learned from the experiences and lessons of his two brothers, joined the Communist Party, and found the true path to the liberation of the working class. Their father is a dock coolie, and their mother is a yarn factory worker. The location of this story is in Shanghai, and the time is from the "September 18th" Incident to after the liberation of Shanghai in 1949. The historical background and life are real. The story structure is completely fictional. The characters are based on the types of workers now. Through this story, everyone can understand the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Communist Party and the working class, and understand why only the leadership of the Communist Party and the heroic struggle of the entire working class can be liberated, and why the working class must step up production after liberation.

The effect of the lecture was very good. The workers were excited with the changes of the characters, stories, and plots. When talking about an old Communist Party member worker who would rather die than surrender and sacrificed himself generously, everyone in the audience stood up and shouted slogans with their arms raised! When talking about their mother still working in the factory on the day she gave birth to the third, but still being insulted by "So and So," the whole audience was quiet, and I saw several female workers wiping their eyes with handkerchiefs under the stage.

Every time I finished a section, I analyzed the section and asked a few questions, saying, "From this incident, everyone can see..." In the workers' words, tell a little "politics." For example, when I talked about the eldest brother who only endured the persecution of the oppressors and did not dare to resist, and finally died tragically. Then I said: "From this incident, we can see that the working class wants liberation, and can only achieve the goal by uniting and resolutely resisting the oppressors. The working class can only liberate itself, and any timidity or endurance cannot solve the problem." When talking about the factory becoming state-owned after the liberation of Shanghai, the third led everyone to actively produce, save raw materials, and improve quality; in the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang, he led everyone to carry out strikes. I said: "Why? Because after liberation, the factory became the working class's own, and the workers are the masters of the factory." The story was told for ten days. After finishing, let everyone discuss. The discussion questions are: Who should we learn from? Why? etc. The results of the discussions in each group were completely consistent: Learn from the third; because only in this way can the working class seek liberation.

Later, the workers made a request: Tell us more about politics! That is to say: Their level of awareness has improved, and they are eager to know more things and reasons. So I started to talk about the "History of Social Development," talking about "Labor Creates the World," "Who Supports Whom," "Establishing a New Labor Attitude," "The Interests of State-Owned Factories and the Interests of the Working Class are Completely Consistent," and so on. When talking about these issues, I tried to give more vivid examples from the factory and examples from literary works. Although the workers still found it not as easy to understand as listening to stories, most people were willing to study hard.

When the "Study Class" ended, of the more than 200 people in the class, 47 applied to join the League; 12 applied to join the Party. What I will never forget is that there was a young female worker in the study class, Comrade Yang Xiujuan, nicknamed "Little Old American," who was only sixteen years old. In the old society, she suffered humiliation and damage, and her spirit was greatly devastated, so that she was somewhat perverted in character and had many shortcomings. But after studying, she expressed her determination to correct her shortcomings and strive to join the League. Until recently, Comrade Ge Fen, the former propaganda committee member of the factory's Party general branch, came to Beijing and learned that Comrade Yang Xiujuan had returned to her production post and made significant progress in production, life, and study. Unfortunately, she died of meningitis in February, and still thought about the factory in her illness. Most of the other comrades in the "Study Class" participated in the work of the new factory. In the production competition, the achievements of the new factory became the vanguard of the whole factory (the factory is divided into three branches), and most of the activists in this production movement were those who had studied in the study class. This is of course due to the efforts of the worker comrades and various reasons. It is by no means said that this is entirely the result of the study class, let alone that it is because the literary weapon was used when lecturing in the study class. But one thing is certain: Using literary works or through literary forms to carry out propaganda and education work is one of the effective ways.

In the process of practice, I gradually realized that literary works should be used to enrich the content of our propaganda and education work, that is to say, our literary works should be further combined with the masses and serve the masses. I once thought that this was my new discovery or new creation in my work. But recently, in the process of learning, I realized that I had overestimated myself too much, and I deeply felt that I was ignorant. Looking at the Soviet Union, the experience in this area is so rich and so mature. The article "How Primary Political Study Groups of the Soviet Communist Youth League Use Literary Books in Study" (written by En. Smirnova of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory) published in this issue of this journal ("China Youth," No. 39 - Editor) is a good proof. In the Soviet Union, the use of literary and artistic forms for political education is a completely formal method. The Soviet Communist Youth League attaches great importance to literature and art. For example, Comrade Pa. Uchenkov, a propagandist of the Communist Youth League of the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow, said in his article "How Does a Propagandist Lead Political Study?": "When studying, I used literary and artistic works. At the beginning of the school year, when I introduced the course of the study group to the group members, I compiled a book list and suggested that they read the books listed on the book list." "The book list listed is not very many. It includes the following works: Gorky's "Mother" and "My Universities", Mayakovsky's "Lenin", Lioni Ze's "Stalin", Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered", Fadeyev's "The Young Guard", Gonchar's "Flag Bearers", Gorbachev's "Unsubdued People", Bubennov's "Birch Tree", Bilyukov's "Seagull" and so on." Through these works, he achieved great results in leading the political study of the League members.

For example, the main cultural life in Soviet factory clubs is literary evenings. The activities of this literary evening are diverse: either discussing a published novel, or holding a symposium for writers, or talking about a book, or reciting a book.

The "Literary Thursday" of the Central Institute of Aerohydrodynamics has been held for three years. The factory's library notifies all workers of the next program before the next Thursday. Most of them are discussing novels. Workers are well prepared before the formal discussion, and heated discussions about the novel can often be heard during meal breaks.

Once the guest of "Thursday Evening" was Ehrenburg, and the heated discussion was his novel "The Storm." Another "Thursday Evening" was attended by Boris Polevoi, the author of the novel "A Real Man." Even more successful that night was the protagonist of the book, the famous aviator A. Maresyev, who also attended the discussion. Other famous writers also often attend those evenings, as long as his work is being discussed, he will attend. This kind of evening has achieved a good effect of political education.

There are also very good examples in our country. For example, the Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League issued a notice in September last year, calling on all League members in the city to study the article "Captain Kulishchenko - In Memory of the Soviet Air Force Volunteer Team in the War of Resistance Against Japan," and pointed out that this is a very vivid and educational story. The Municipal Committee of the League decided to print and distribute it and stipulate that all League members in the city should organize reading and discussion, and mobilize non-League youth to participate in this study as much as possible, so that the youth in the whole factory, the whole school, and the whole agency can read or listen to this story. It also pointed out that attention should be paid to the flexibility of the method when carrying out the study, and avoid stiff discussions. Forms such as story meetings can be adopted; the study can also be linked to other educational contents related to internationalism. This is also one of the good ways to use literary works to carry out propaganda and education work.

From the above examples, we can learn more and better methods of using literary books in political study.

In general, there are various ways to use literary works for propaganda and education.

1. Select some excellent literary books to introduce to young people for reading and organize discussions.
2. Recite literary works to young people for listening and organize discussions.
3. Use literary works as examples when lecturing.
4. According to the story in a literary work, tell it to everyone by saying storytelling method. Or combine the stories in several literary works into a story and tell it to everyone. And put forward key points and questions to explain to everyone.

In comparison, the first two methods are suitable for use among educated youth; the latter two methods are suitable for use among working-class and peasant youth who have less literacy and are still illiterate or semi-literate.

When using literary books, there must be a clear purpose; to inspire everyone to combine and discuss the problems existing in the current work in thought. For example, the Northeast League Committee recommended the article "Captain Kulishchenko" to everyone in order to strengthen the internationalist education of League members and youth, and so on. The literary works used must be selected and carried out purposefully and systematically. When organizing discussions, guide everyone to focus on the ideological and political significance of the works, and do not simply discuss the writing skills of the works. By doing this, the expected effect can be achieved; because literary works explain problems and explain political ideas through life and concrete images; especially young people are easy to accept, thereby affecting and transforming thoughts and actions, thereby inspiring them to gradually study and study political theory.

　　怎样运用文学作品来进行宣传教育工作？
    吴小武
    编者按：我们的文学、戏剧、电影、音乐和美术，是为人民服务的，首先是为工农兵服务的。它应当启发人民的政治觉悟，鼓励人民的劳动热情，培养人民的新道德，以发扬它的教育人民的伟大功能。我们一方面要求每一文艺作品具有这种内容。另一方面要求人民中的积极分子、共产党员、青年团员、人民政府和人民解放军的工作人员将这种作品有计划有组织地在人民群众中间进行宣传，在工厂、农村、部队、学校中，组织阅读、朗诵、演映和讨论。本文原载中国青年第三十九期，作者吴小武同志根据亲身经验，指出这种文艺宣传的作用，并提供了具体的方法。我们认为这些经验和方法值得宣传教育工作者的参考、采用和推广。
    一九四五年夏天，我在张家口铁路工厂里做教育工作。里边有一个叫王春年的青年技工，他在工人里边不算积极也不算落后；不过，他很喜欢看小说。有一次，他读了苏联名作家奥斯特洛夫斯基的《钢铁是怎样炼成的》。读后，他写了一篇《读后感想》；记得里边有一句话说：“我立志要做保尔·柯察金第二（书中的英雄）。”从此，他在生产上、学习上一天比一天积极了。不久，敌人进攻张家口，我军主动撤退，王春年就背上步枪随同我们走了。在行军过程中，他表现得很坚决。他随身带着苏联作家毕尔文采夫的《考验》，一有功夫，他就读它。他说：他已经读了两遍了。常常是一面行军，他就把书里的故事讲给旁的工人听。他说：“我们的撤退也是为了进攻，是为了更有效地消灭敌人，不久我们就要打回张家口去的！”他的行装极简单，但却带了一付钳工用的工具。很显然，他的思想和行动，是受了这两本书的影响的。到了老根据地以后，在建厂的工作中他成了积极分子，不久，他参加了共产党。当然，不能说他的进步，完全是为读了这两本小说的缘故。但至少可以说：这两本革命的优秀的文学作品，在这个青年身上是产生了积极的作用；成为他进步的重要因素之一。
    我自己是一个小资产阶级家庭出身的青年。我之参加革命，最初也是因为读了高尔基的《在人间》。这本书使我的眼界开阔了。原来在世界上还有那么多的自己闻所未闻见所未见的人和人的生活。接着我又读了其他一些革命文学作品。这些作品，今天看来，甚至还有些不健康的东西，但启发了我的幻想，给了我探索新的生活以及对于黑暗社会的反抗的勇气。在当时曾经是起了一定的积极作用的。
    据我所知，和我同一时代的一些青年和知识分子，最初参加革命的动机，也常常是因为受了革命的文学作品的影响。但我那时以为对于工农群众就未必如此。自从我在王春年身上发现了类乎这样的情形以后，看法上也就有了改变，使我比较深刻地认识了《文艺必须为工农兵服务》这一英明的论点。
    一九四七年冬天，我在冀中定县马阜才村参加土地改革工作。在村里过阴历年的时候，停止工作四天。这村有好几个说评书的，趁这机会，就分了几摊说开了水浒、小八义、封神榜……，听众极多，兴趣很浓，深夜不散；和我平时向村里群众讲话的情形比较起来，真令人羡慕不止。这启发了我把我所惯用的比较枯燥的说教式的宣传方式改变一下，试图运用文学作品通过说评书的形式向农民进行宣传教育。我读过不少小说，还受过一个时期的演员训练；所以这在我是并不十分困难的。我针对着当时农民的思想中存在着的问题，决定了宣传的内容。例如：为什么农民运动只有有了共产党的领导才能取得胜利？为什么土改以后还必须加紧生产才能丰衣足食？根据这些问题，就来选择能够回答这些问题的文学作品。但是，在我读过的文学作品里边，却没有恰好完全能解决这些问题的。于是我就把几本作品中的内容综合在一起，例如《白毛女》、《晴天》、《李家庄的变迁》、《血尸案》、《李有才板话》、《夜明珠》、《血泪仇》……并且加上自己的一些“创造”，拟了个提纲，编成了一部书，名叫《苦辣酸甜》。也学说评书的人那样：声调有高低、有表情、有动作……向农民们开讲了。一连讲了两天两夜，既未敲锣召集人，也未派人按家按户去叫，听讲的人却越来越多，听讲的时候，中途溜跑的、打瞌睡的人是没有了！显然比我的演讲叫座。后来每逢开会的时候，他们总是要让我先说一段书。而且，当他们在辩论一个问题的时候，常常引用《苦辣酸甜》中的例子。
    去年冬天，我到天津中纺二厂去帮助“工人学习班”的工作。参加这个“学习班”的人大都是生产上、思想上进步得较慢的。开头讲了几课“社会发展史”，真是有点格格不入，连课堂的秩序也很难维持，人们大有不忍卒“听”的样子。我马上改变了方法。找了丁克辛同志所作的通俗长篇故事：《三兄弟》。哥儿三个都是工人，老大是一个旧社会里所谓“安分守己”的人，掉下张树叶也怕砸破了脑袋，对于压迫者的迫害，只会忍受，不敢反抗，终于悲惨地死去了。老二恰好相反：脾气暴躁，谁敢通他一下，他就和他拼命………有些盲动，以致碰了几回壁以后，就挺而走险，毫无价值地牺牲了自己的生命。老三接受了两个哥哥的经验教训，参加了共产党，找到了工人阶级真正解放的道路。他们的父亲是一个码头苦力，母亲是一个纱厂工人。这个故事的地点是在上海，时间从“九一八”事变起，直到一九四九年上海解放以后。历史背景和生活是真实的。故事结构完全是虚构的。人物是根据现在的工人中的类型描写的。通过这个故事，可以让大家了解共产党和工人阶级的血肉关系，了解为什么唯有共产党的领导和全体工人阶级英勇奋斗，才能得到解放，以及解放以后工人阶级为什么要加紧生产。
    讲的效果很好，工人们随着人物、故事、情节的变化而激动、兴奋。当讲到一个老工人共产党员，宁死不屈，慷慨就义的时候，全场的人都站了起来，高举胳膊喊口号了！当讲到他们的母亲在生老三的那天还在厂里做工，却还受到“那么温”辱骂的时候，全场静悄悄地，我看见台下有好几个女工用手绢在擦拭眼睛。
    我每当讲完了一节，就把这一节分析一下，提出几个问题来，说：“从这件事情里边，大家可以看到……”用工人的话来说：讲一点“政治”。比方说我讲到老大对于压迫者的迫害，只会忍受，不敢反抗，终于悲惨地死去了。接着我就说：“从这件事情里边我们可以看到：工人阶级要求解放，只有团结起来，向压迫者进行坚决的反抗才能达到目的。工人阶级只有自己才能解放自己，任何畏缩、忍受，是解决不了问题的。”当讲到上海解放以后，那个工厂成了国营的了，老三就带动大家积极生产，节省原料、提高质量；而在过去在国民党统治时代，他是带动大家实行怠工罢工的。我就说：“为什么呢？因为解放以后，工厂成了工人阶级自己的了，工人是工厂的主人翁。”这个故事整整讲了十天。讲完以后，让大家讨论，讨论题是：应该向谁学？为什么？等，各小组讨论的结果是完全一致的：向老三学；因为只有这样工人阶级才能求得解放。
    后来，工人们就提出了要求：给我们多讲点政治吧！这就是说：他们的觉悟程度提高了，急于要知道更多的事情和道理了。于是我就又讲起“社会发展史”来，讲“劳动创造世界”、“谁养活谁”、“建立新的劳动态度”、“国营工厂的利益和工人阶级的利益完全一致”等等。讲这些问题的时候，我尽量多举本厂的生动的例子，和文学作品中的例子，工人们听起来虽然还不如听故事时那样容易懂，但是大多数人都很愿意努力学习。
    当“学习班”结束的时候，全班二百多人，有四十七人申请入团；十二人申请入党。最使我难忘的是：学习班里有一个青年女工杨秀娟同志，外号叫“小老美”，才十六岁，她在旧社会里，受尽了污辱和损害，精神上受到了很大的摧残，以致性格上有些变态，缺点很多，但经过学习以后，她就表示要下决心改正缺点，争取入团。最近以前，该厂的前党总支宣传委员謌焚同志来京，才知道杨秀娟同志回到生产岗位上以后，在生产上、生活上、学习上，有了显著的进步。不幸在二月间患脑膜炎逝世，病中还念念不忘厂里的事。“学习班”里其他的同志，大部分都参加了新厂的工作，在生产竞赛中，新厂的成绩成为全厂的先锋（该厂共分三个分厂），而在这个生产运动中的积极分子，大部都是在学习班里学习过的。这当然是由于工人同志的努力以及各方面原因所造成的，决不是说这完全是学习班的成绩，更不是说因为学习班里在讲课的时候曾经运用了文学这个武器。但有一点是可以肯定的：运用文学作品或通过文学的形式来进行宣传教育工作，是有效的方式之一。
    在实践过程中，我逐渐体验到：应当运用文学作品来丰富我们宣传教育工作的内容，也就是说，应当使我们的文学作品更进一步地和群众结合，为群众服务。我曾以为这是我在工作中的新发现或新创造。但最近在学习的过程中才知道把自己作了过高的估计，深感自己孤陋寡闻。看看苏联，在这一方面的经验，是多么丰富，多么成熟。本刊本期（《中国青年》第三十九期——编者）所发表的《苏联青年团初级政治学习小组在学习中怎样利用文艺书籍》一文（斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂恩·斯密尔诺瓦作），就是一个很好的证明。在苏联，使用文艺形式来进行政治教育完全是正规的办法。苏联青年团对文艺是非常重视的。例如：苏联莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂团的宣传员帕·乌琴科夫同志，在《一个宣传员怎样领导政治学习？》一文中说：“在学习时，我是利用文艺作品的。还是在学年刚开始我向组员们介绍学习小组的课程的时候，我就编出了一张书单，建议他们去阅读书单上所列举的书籍。”“这张书单所列举的书目是不很多的。其中包括下列作品：高尔基的《母亲》与《我的大学》，马雅科夫斯基的《列宁传》，李昂尼泽的《斯大林传》，奥斯特洛夫斯基的《钢铁是怎样炼成的》，法捷耶夫的《青年近卫军》，冈察尔的《旗手》，哥尔巴托夫的《不屈的人们》，布宾诺夫的《白桦树》，比流科夫的《海鸥》等。”通过了这些作品，他在领导团员的政治学习中，收到了巨大的效果。
    又如：苏联工厂俱乐部里主要的文化生活是文学晚会。这种文学晚会的活动是多样的：或者讨论一部出版的小说，或者开作家座谈会，或者谈一本书，或者朗诵一本书。
    中央空气水力研究院工厂的“文学礼拜四”已举办了三年。该厂的图书馆在下一个礼拜四前就通知全体工人下次的节目。大部分是讨论小说。在正式讨论前工人都有充分准备，往往在吃饭休息中间可以听到对那部小说的热烈讨论。
    有一次“礼拜四晚会”的客人是爱伦堡，热烈讨论的就是他的小说《暴风雨》。另一个“礼拜四晚会”来了鲍里斯·波里伏衣，他是小说《真实的人》的作者，那晚上更成功的是书中的主人翁名飞行家Ａ·马列西耶夫也出席参加了讨论会。其他的名作家也经常去出席那些晚会，只要他的作品被讨论到的时候，他是会出席的。这种晚会，收到了很好的政治教育的效果。
    在我国也有很好的例子。如青年团沈阳市工委宣传部，在去年九月，曾发了一个通知，号召全市团员学习《库里申科大队长——追记抗日战争中的苏联空军志愿队》一文，并指出：这是一篇非常生动而有教育意义的故事。团市工委会决定印发它并规定全市青年团员有组织地进行阅读和讨论，尽可能地发动外团青年参加这个学习，要使全厂、全校、全机关里的青年，都能读或听讲这个故事。并且指出：在进行学习时应注意方式的灵活，避免生硬的讨论，可采取故事会等形式；学习也可联系其他关系国际主义的教育内容。这也是很好的运用文学作品进行宣传教育工作的方式之一。
    从上面这些例子里，我们可以学习到更多更好的如何在政治学习中利用文艺书籍的方法。
    总的说起来，运用文学作品来进行宣传教育，可以有各种各样的方法。
    一、选定若干优秀的文学书目介绍给青年阅读，并且组织讨论。
    二、朗诵文学作品给青年们听，并且组织讨论。
    三、在讲课时运用文学作品作例子。
    四、根据一本文学作品中的故事，用说评书的方法讲给大家听。或根据数本文学作品中的故事综合编成一个故事讲给大家听。并且提出要点和问题，向大家讲解。
    比较起来，前两种方法宜于在知识青年中运用；后两种方法宜在识字较少和还是文盲或半文盲的工农青年中运用。
    在运用文艺书籍的时候，必须要有一个明确的目的；启发大家结合讨论当前工作中思想中存在着的问题。例如东北团委为了加强团员及青年的国际主义教育，就向大家推荐《库里申科大队长》一文等等。所运用的文学作品必须经过选择，有目的有计划地进行。组织讨论时，引导大家着重作品的思想——政治意义，不要单纯地去讨论作品的写作技巧。这样做，就可以收到预期的效果；因为文学作品是通过生活，通过具体的形象来说明问题，来阐明政治思想的；特别是青年易于接受，从而影响和改造了思想和行动，从而启发他们逐步地去研究和学习政治理论。
