Beijing News Agency Report: The Bureau of Culture and Education Re-notifies All Elementary Schools and Kindergartens to Thoroughly Abolish the System of Corporal Punishment

[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] After the liberation of Beijing, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education issued a clear order to all municipal private elementary schools and kindergartens to abolish the system of corporal punishment, implement democratic management, and implement the New Democratic education policy. However, to this day, the phenomenon of corporal punishment of students has not been completely eliminated, and serious incidents of corporal punishment of students still occur in some schools. On June 1st, the Bureau of Culture and Education re-issued a notice to all schools to conduct inspections and discussions, and it is imperative to thoroughly eliminate the phenomenon of corporal punishment.

　　Luo Shuming, a third-grade teacher at the private Sanzhong Elementary School in the 11th district, severely beat student Wang Yanling with a rattan cane on April 27th because the student did not do his homework during the Chinese language class and tore up his notebook. The student suffered seven bumps on his head and eleven red welts on his face, neck, arms, and hands. Afterwards, during his self-criticism, Luo Shuming blamed the student for being naughty and disobedient, claiming that his starting point for hitting the student was "out of good intentions." He did not recognize this mistake from an ideological or principled standpoint. Zhao Tianmin, the principal of the school, did not provide sufficient leadership in ordinary times. After the incident occurred, he did not report it or humbly examine himself, but instead believed that ideological education could not be carried out for third-grade students, and attempted to end the matter hastily.

　　Afterwards, the Bureau of Culture and Education conducted a general inspection and found that other schools also had instances of corporal punishment of students. For example, Wang Dezheng, a teacher at Yuegezhuang Elementary School in the 15th district, saw students fighting on April 25th. Without asking right from wrong or providing education, he grabbed student Cheng Yiyong and slapped him several times. After the beating, he dragged him into the handyman's room to kneel in punishment, and beat the student's left thigh violently with a wooden stick, causing the injury to bleed at the time, making it difficult to move. Various forms of corporal punishment also existed at the private Zhaohui Elementary School. For example, Song Jingxian, a physical education teacher, hit students on the head with a score book because they were naughty while standing in line, causing the nails on the score book to scratch the student's head. In addition, Liao Guangwen, a third-grade teacher, did not allow students who had not finished their homework to go home for dinner, and sometimes imposed standing punishments.

　　The occurrence of these phenomena is due to the fact that some teachers still have strong feudal educational ideas. In order to rectify educational work discipline, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education gave Luo Shuming and Zhao Tianmin a demerit and a criticism, respectively. In the notification on June 1st, all municipal private elementary schools and kindergartens were required to conduct discussions based on the specific circumstances of each school, and to conduct inspections and ideological education for all faculty and staff, in order to implement democratic life and thoroughly eliminate the phenomenon of corporal punishment.

　　文教局再度通知各小学及幼稚园            彻底废除体罚制度
    【京市新闻处讯】北京解放后，市文教局曾明令各市私立小学及幼稚园废除体罚制度，实行民主管理，贯彻新民主主义的教育方针。但直到今天，体罚学生的现象并未彻底肃清，有些学校仍有严重的体罚学生事件发生。文教局于六月一日再度通报各校，进行检查讨论，必须彻底肃清体罚现象。
    十一区私立三忠小学三年级级任教员罗书铭，在四月二十七日因学生王延龄上国语时未做作业，并将笔记本撕毁，便用藤教鞭将该生毒打成伤。该生头部被打了七个包，脸、脖、臂手等处被打了十一条红痕。事后，罗书铭在检讨时，反归过于学生调皮不听话，认为打学生的出发点是“恨铁不成钢”。并未从思想上原则上去认识这个错误。该校校长赵天民平素领导不够，事情发生后不报告，亦不虚心检讨，却认为三年级学生无法进行思想教育，企图轻率结束。
    事后，文教局曾进行了一次普遍的检查，发现其他学校亦曾有体罚学生的现象发生。如十五区岳各庄小学教员王德正在四月二十五日见学生打架，便不问是非亦不进行教育，拉住学生程伊永就是几个耳光，打后又拉入工友室罚跪，并拿起木棍暴打学生左大腿，当时伤处流血，难于行动。私立昭慧小学也存在着各种体罚现象。如体育教员宋景贤因学生站队淘气，便用记分册打学生的头，以致记分册上的钉子将学生头部刮破。又三年级级任廖广文对没有做完功课的学生，不许回家吃饭，有时还实行罚站。
    这些现象的发生，是由于有些教员还存在着浓厚的封建教育思想。市文教局为整饬教育工作纪律，对罗书铭、赵天民二人分别予以记过和批评。在六月一日通报中，要各市私立小学及幼稚园，依据各校具体情况展开讨论，并对全体教职员进行检查和思想教育。以便贯彻民主生活彻底肃清体罚现象。
