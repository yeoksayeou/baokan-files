　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 29th -- Fujian Province's warehouse material inventory work has achieved significant results. The warehouses of the Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry, Department of Health, Navigation Bureau, and various local trading companies and telecommunications bureaus have completed their inventory by May 20th, and are now in the process of valuation and report preparation. A comprehensive inventory across the province will be completed by the end of June.

　　The large quantities of materials cleared out by the above units are of great value for supporting the front lines and production construction. For example, a warehouse of the Navigation Bureau cleared out a large number of compasses, anchors, winches, more than 1,400 large bundles of palm, hemp, and yarn ropes, more than 70,000 jin of brand-new screws and iron nails for shipbuilding, and more than 300 barrels of paint, which is of great help for repairing, manufacturing, and overhauling boats for crossing the sea. The directly affiliated warehouses of the Provincial Government's Department of Industry cleared out more than 200 tons of cast iron, solving the material difficulties of the machine factory under construction. In addition, there are thirteen rice milling machines, rice hulling machines, and steam engines, which can be built into a well-equipped rice mill with only repairs or additional equipment. A large number of water pipes scattered in Fuzhou and Nanping are estimated to be sufficient for installing water pipes on the main streets of Fuzhou city. The Provincial Hospital, under the Provincial Government’s Department of Health, cleared out important medicines stored for a long time and about to be damaged, with a current value of 2 billion RMB. The Fuzhou Telecommunications Bureau cleared out 100 telegraph recorders, worth 1 billion RMB, enough for 50 first-class telecommunications bureaus to install, and more than 1,000 pieces of equipment have been sorted and packed separately, waiting for allocation.

　　In the inventory work, cadres and workers are very responsible and serious. In addition to strictly implementing unpacking and counting each item, they also carry out detailed work such as classification, numbering, registration, and valuation. When the workers of the Electric Power Company inspected the entire Fuzhou City outer line, they braved the scorching sun or sudden rain to climb the electric poles to check the wires, batteries, iron frames, etc. The farm and pest control station under the Provincial Government’s Department of Agriculture cleared out missing account materials worth more than 60,000 jin of rice.

　　This large-scale inventory revealed the shortcomings of some leading cadres in various agencies who in the past paid very little attention to the storage and transportation of materials. The warehouse system was generally not implemented by various agencies, and some had not even established it, resulting in serious losses to state property. For example, the Xiamen City Trading Company lost more than 7,000 jin of rice due to lack of attention to material storage and inspection; and 9,400 jin of export oranges rotted due to prolonged delay without proper handling. The Nanping warehouse under the Provincial Government's Department of Industry has been under management for more than eight months, and 10,000 feet of poplin and 170 barrels of foreign ash (cement) that had rotted and solidified into stone during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang were not discovered until the inventory was conducted. In the inventory work, local governments educated all personnel with practical examples, prompting various agencies to begin to pay attention to storage and transportation work, strengthen supervision, and strictly implement the system. After studying relevant financial and economic documents and participating in the inventory work, the management personnel changed their past irresponsible and simple "watching the warehouse" mentality.

　　福建清出大量物资
    对支援前线和生产建设都有很大价值
    【新华社福州二十九日电】福建省仓库物资清理工作已有重要成绩。省人民政府实业厅、卫生厅、航务局及各地贸易公司、电信局等单位所属仓库物资，已在五月二十日以前清查完毕，现正估价与造报清册。全省各地的全面清理工作将于六月底结束。
    上述各单位已清理出的大批物资，对于支援前线及生产建设都有很大价值。如航务局某仓库清查出大批罗盘、铁锚、车机，及棕、麻、纱绳一千四百余大捆，造船用的全新的螺丝铁钉七万余斤，油漆三百余桶，对修造和整补渡海船只有莫大帮助。省府实业厅直属各仓库共清查出铸铁二百多吨，解决了正在筹建中的机器厂的材料困难。另外还有十三座碾米机、砻米机、蒸汽机，只需加以修理或添加设备，即可建设成一个设备完善的碾米厂。分散于福州和南平等地的大批自来水管，占计足敷福州全市主要街道安设水管之用。省府卫生厅所属省立医院清查出久存未用而即将损坏的重要药品折合现价达人民币二十亿元。福州电信局清查出电报记录器一百部，价值十亿元，足供五十处一等电讯局装用，尚有一千余件器材已经分别整理装箱，等待调配。
    在清查工作中，干部与职工们都很负责认真。他们除严格执行开箱启封逐件清点外，并进行分类、编号、登记、估价等细致工作。电力公司的工人们在清查整个福州市外线时，都冒着烈日或骤雨攀上电杆逐一检查电线、电瓶、铁架等。省府农业处所属农场及病虫害防治所清查出漏账物资价值达六万余斤大米。
    此次大清查暴露了若干机关的领导干部过去对物资储运工作极不重视的缺点。各机关对仓库制度一般都未执行，有的甚至尚未建立，因而使国家财产遭受严重损失。如厦门市贸易公司因不重视物资保管和检查，以致损失大米七千余斤；出口橘子因延误过久而不作适当处理，腐烂达九千四百余斤。省府实业厅所属南平仓库接管以来已八个多月，库存国民党匪帮统治时期烂掉的一万余尺府绸及凝成石块的一百七十桶洋灰，直至清查时方才发觉。各地政府在清查工作中，以实际事例教育了全体人员，促使各机关开始重视储运工作，并加强监督，严格执行制度。管理人员经过学习有关财经工作的文件并参加清查工作以后，转变了过去不负责的单纯“看仓库”思想。
