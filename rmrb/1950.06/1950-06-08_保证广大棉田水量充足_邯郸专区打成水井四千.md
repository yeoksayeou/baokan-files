　　To Ensure Sufficient Water for Vast Cotton Fields, Handan Prefecture Drills Four Thousand Wells

　　[Report from this newspaper, Handan] This year, Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, is planting over 3.2 million mu of cotton. To ensure sufficient water for the cotton fields and achieve increased production, the masses are now being widely mobilized to drill wells through mutual aid. After completing the cotton sowing task, the Handan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed the county committees and all Party members and cadres in the region to actively lead the masses to quickly shift to well-drilling work, planning to drill six thousand wells before the wheat harvest. As of the 17th, according to statistics from Wei County, Linqing, Ci County, Daming, Linzhang, Wu'an, Cheng'an, Qiu County, Yongnian, Feixiang, Handan, Jize, Guangping, Quzhou, Guantao, and other counties, 4,219 new wells have been drilled, 380 old wells have been repaired, and 634 wells have been bored. Incomplete statistics from only six counties, including Linqing and Feixiang, indicate that 663 wells are currently under construction but not yet completed. From the progress of each county, Wei County is the fastest. The county's annual plan was to drill 700 wells, but it has now drilled 912, exceeding the plan by 212. The plan has now been raised to 1,000 wells. Linqing planned to drill 700 wells before the wheat harvest, and 651 have now been drilled, with over 280 still under construction, and 932 can be completed before the wheat harvest. The slowest progress in well-drilling work is in Guantao County. Due to the lack of well-drilling experience among the masses and the failure to hire sufficient technicians early on, the comprehensive development of well-drilling work has been affected, and only 16 wells have been drilled. The leading cadres in the county have now paid attention to this. Because other preparatory work is still considered proper, the task of 200 wells should be completed. Before the start of well-drilling work in various places, there were many concerns among the masses: some were unable to drill wells due to dispersed land, or lacked bricks and wood, which could not be solved; some villages believed that drilling wells was expensive; some villages lacked technology and feared that they would not be able to drill wells, resulting in a waste of manpower and materials; some were afraid of becoming waterlogged land, increasing the burden. Due to these ideological situations, the smooth development of well-drilling work was seriously affected at the beginning. After the leadership of various counties discovered this, they mobilized and organized the masses to voluntarily work together and use the wells jointly, according to the dispersion and distance of the land in each village; for those with difficulties in materials, cooperative mutual assistance was adopted. For example, in Yangzhuang, Feixiang County, three households worked together to drill two wells, and eighteen households voluntarily raised grain to help. For those who had difficulty drilling wells and were unable to solve them, the public lent bricks and grain to help; and the masses were called upon to practice economy and oppose extravagance and waste in well-drilling work. Some counties lacked well-drilling experience and technology, so they held well-drilling technician training classes to introduce and promote experience and mobilize everyone to learn technology. On the issue of burdens, the policy of not increasing the burden for three years when dry land is converted into paddy fields was widely publicized. At the same time, the masses who jointly drilled wells were mobilized to sign contracts to dispel the masses' ideological concerns about water disputes arising from joint well drilling. As these ideological problems were solved in a timely manner, the well-drilling work quickly entered a climax.

　　保证广大棉田水量充足  邯郸专区打成水井四千
    【本报邯郸讯】河北省邯郸专区今年植棉三百二十余万亩，为保证棉田水量充足，达到增产目的，现正广泛发动群众互助打井。该专区在完成棉花播种任务后，中共邯郸地委即指示各县委及全区党员干部，积极领导群众迅速转向打井工作，计划在麦收前打井六千眼。截至十七日为止，据魏县、临清、磁县、大名、临漳、武安、成安、邱县、永年、肥乡、邯郸、鸡泽、广平、曲周、馆陶等县统计，已打成新井四千二百一十九眼，修旧井三百八十眼，钻井六百三十四眼，业已动工尚未完成者，仅据临清、肥乡等六个县不完全统计，即有六百六十三眼。从各县进度来看，以魏县为最快，该县全年计划打井七百眼，现已打成九百一十二眼，超过计划二百一十二眼，现已将计划提高到一千眼。临清麦收前计划打井七百眼，现已打成六百五十一眼，正在动工的尚有二百八十余眼，麦前可完成九百三十二眼。打井工作进度最慢的是馆陶县，该县由于群众没有打井经验，又未及早聘定足够的技术人员，影响了打井工作的全面开展，只打成了十六眼。现该县领导干部已加以注意，因其他准备工作尚称妥善，二百眼井的任务，当可完成。各地在打井工作开始之前，群众思想上曾存在不少顾虑：有的因土地分散，一家打不成，或缺砖、缺木料，无法解决；有些村认为打井花费大；有的村因缺乏技术，怕打不成，反而浪费人力、物力；有的怕变成水地，负担增多。由于这些思想情况，开始时严重的影响了打井工作的顺利开展。各县领导方面发觉后，即根据各村土地分散情况及远近，动员与组织群众自愿伙打伙用；对物力困难者，采取合作互助。如肥乡县杨庄有三户伙打井两眼，有十八户自动筹粮帮助。对打井有困难而无力解决者，则由公家贷砖、贷粮扶助；并号召群众在打井工作中，厉行节约，反对铺张浪费现象。有些县因无打井经验，缺乏技术，则举办了打井技师训练班，以介绍与推广经验，发动大家学习技术。在负担问题上，广泛宣传了旱田变水田，三年不增加负担的政策。同时，发动合伙打井的群众订立合同，解除群众怕伙打井发生水利纠纷的思想顾虑。由于这些思想问题得到及时解决，使打井工作迅速进入高潮。
