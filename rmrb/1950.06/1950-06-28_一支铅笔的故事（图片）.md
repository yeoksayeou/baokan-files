    The Story of a Pencil
    Yu Zhen
    (Comic Strip) (V)
    (Twenty-two) "Soldier's Life" is here, and comrades are scrambling to read it. I spotted my ballad, published in "Soldier's Life" under the title "Great Annihilation Battle on the Guangdong-Guangxi Border." Comrades all gave a thumbs up, saying, "You're really something!"
    (Twenty-three) Soon after, "Soldier's Life" sent another letter, hiring me as a correspondent for "Soldier's Life."
    (Twenty-four) Later, the instructor told me to study harder. The regimental political commissar also encouraged me to keep practicing. Comrades, think about it, it's not that we were born stupid, we just didn't have the opportunity to study in the past when we were poor. Now they provide both pens and books, helping us learn. Wouldn't it be wrong not to study hard? Therefore, I resolved to work hard to learn culture and become a revolutionary soldier who is both cultured and martial.

    一支铅笔的故事

    （连环画）（五）
    （二十二）“战士生活”来了，同志们抢着看。一眼看见了咱那篇说唱，登在“战士生活”上面，题目是“粤桂边大围歼战”。同志们都伸着大姆指说：“你真不简单”。
    （二十三）、不久“战士生活”又寄来了一封信，聘请我当“战士生活”的通讯员。
    （二十四）后来指导员叫我加紧学。团政委也鼓励我加油练。同志们想一想，不是咱生来就笨，不想读书。过去咱穷人想学文化能行吗？现今又发笔又发书，帮助咱们学习。不好好学习对吗？我因此决心努力学习文化，当个文武双全的革命军人。
