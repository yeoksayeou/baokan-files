Solving the Most Pressing Problems of the Masses
    A Record of the People's Representatives Conference in the Seventh District
    By Our Reporter Pei Lan

　　The first People's Representatives Conference of the Seventh District of Beijing has successfully concluded. This conference created an important experience: the District People's Representatives Conference should earnestly solve one or two of the most pressing problems facing the masses. In the Seventh District, the working people urgently demand improved environmental sanitation. This conference focused on solving this problem.

　　The Seventh District is located outside Chongwenmen, surrounded by the city on the north, east, and south sides. The area is remote, and municipal sanitation construction is rudimentary. It is the poorest district in Beijing. Among the 319 roads, large and small, in the district, not one is paved with asphalt or gravel, making them muddy and difficult to travel in the rainy season. The district has a total population of 100,500, mostly working people. There is a severe shortage of tap water, with only 15 water stations. According to statistics from the water company in March of this year, the district's monthly water supply is just over 3,100 tons, only enough for more than 8,500 people. The majority of working people find it very difficult to get drinking water. Residents in the Beishuiguan area have to carry well water from Guangqumen, costing 200 yuan per load. There are 25 wells in the district, and tests by the sanitation laboratory found that 13 of them contain E. coli. Drinking water is both uneconomical and unsanitary for the masses. In addition, most of the district lacks drainage ditches and sewage ponds, so residents inevitably dump dirty water and feces on the streets. Especially in the summer, the stench from the surrounding moat, Longxugou, and sewers overflows, making the streets dirty and smelly, and breeding mosquitoes and flies, causing infectious diseases among the citizens every year.

　　During the rule of the enemy puppets and the Kuomintang bandits, the health of the working people was never a concern. Residents' representatives Mao Ruinian and Zhao Songnian said: "We are both over forty years old, but we have never seen the enemy puppet government build a single road for the working people. Today, the world has changed, and the Communist Party and the People's Government serve the working people first." Since the liberation of Beijing a year ago, the government has first improved municipal sanitation facilities in the Seventh District, where the working people live, dredging the moat, Longxugou, and the sewers under the Da Shi Qiao bridge, eliminating the phenomenon of perennial sewage accumulation on the streets. Subsequently, a maternal and child health center was established in the district, and all the facilities of the Fourth Municipal Hospital were expanded, allowing the working people to receive treatment free of charge or at reduced rates. Last year, three pregnant women in the district had difficult labors and were referred by the district office to the municipal hospital for delivery.

　　This People's Representatives Conference of the Seventh District received a total of 1,492 opinions from the masses, of which 882 were related to public health and welfare issues. More than 60 percent of these opinions were adopted by the government, and specific implementation plans were drawn up. For example, on the issue of tap water supply, it is planned to add more than 3,400 meters of trunk pipelines, add 29 tap water stations, and renovate 22 private wells in the district. Based on the opinions of the masses and the government's current economic strength, the district plans to build 13 new public toilets and repair existing public and private toilets; build 18 new sewage ponds and repair five; and build 53 new infiltration wells and three urine pools. Regarding the installation of street lights, it was decided to install 86 street lights where poles and wires are available and add 35 new ones. The suggestions made by representatives Su Mengchun, Li Qixian, Zhang Fengshan, and others to repair four roads, including Chongwai Avenue, Suanshìkou to Guangqumen, and the western section of Dongdadi to Fahuasi, were also successfully resolved. The Municipal Construction Bureau has planned to repair Chongwai Avenue into an asphalt road, Guangqumen to Suanshìkou and Dongdadi to Fahuasi into stone roads, and Huashi Street into a gravel road. The representatives warmly supported this plan. Worker representative Zhang Huamin said: "We workers requested the establishment of a workers' clinic in the Seventh District, and the government established two. This proves that the Communist Party is completely thinking of the people. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the working people achieve happiness!" The representatives not only actively put forward their opinions to the government, but also wanted to convey the government's intentions to the masses. For places where tap water pipes could not be installed immediately, or where water stations could not be established, or where roads could not be repaired immediately, the representatives said that they would patiently explain to the masses when they returned.

　　In order to ensure the successful implementation of the conference's decisions and to maintain the district's cleanliness and sanitation permanently, the government and representatives jointly established a sanitation agreement. The articles of the agreement are: (1) Do not arbitrarily dump sewage, garbage, or urinate and defecate anywhere, and jointly protect public sanitation facilities such as public toilets, sewage ponds, infiltration pits, and moats. (2) Maintain cleanliness inside and outside the house and sweep the streets in front of the door; vendors should clean their respective areas. (3) Respond to the government's call and get vaccinated in a timely manner. This agreement was unanimously supported by all the representatives, who are prepared to convey it to the masses in the district for compliance.

　　Another gain of the Seventh District Representatives Conference was the inspection of cadres' undesirable work styles. "Cadres are the people's servants, and whether the servants are doing a good job should be judged by the masses." This is what the head of the Seventh District said when reviewing the work styles of cadres at the representatives' conference. The representatives felt that their responsibilities were significant and that they should earnestly put forward their opinions, praising those who deserved praise and criticizing those who deserved criticism. Mao Ruinian, a representative of the Eighteenth Section, sincerely stated: "Today, government personnel are generally serving the people wholeheartedly; even those who used to work in the Kuomintang reactionary government have become honest. This is entirely due to the power of the Communist Party's education, and it is Chairman Mao's virtuous governance. Take Comrade Zhou Wanying, the head of our Eighteenth Section, for example. He is personally frugal and simple, and his wife spins wool herself for production. If it were the Kuomintang period, becoming a section chief would mean becoming wealthy, sitting high and mighty, and marrying a concubine long ago." The representatives and the masses also criticized individual corrupt cadres. The heads of the Seventh District Office and the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau sincerely made self-criticisms and explained that the government had continuously educated or punished those with bad work styles and those who were corrupt, according to the severity of their mistakes. For example, Guan Zihou, a cadre of the Fahuasi stall management office, usually acted arrogantly, oppressed the masses, and often drank alcohol and did not pay for goods, seriously violating policies. After investigation by the district office, it was confirmed and reported to the municipal government, which not only ordered him to compensate the masses for their losses but also dismissed him from his post. Wang Fuxing, the leader of the Fourth Retail Store work group, and the members of his group collectively embezzled and sold flour with small scales. Wang Fuxing has been sent to the court and sentenced to three years of imprisonment, and the others have also been sentenced to imprisonment and ordered to return the embezzled funds. The government humbly accepts the criticisms of the masses and immediately corrects them, making the representatives feel that today's government is truly their own government. The representatives unanimously expressed that they will work together with the government to jointly build a new Seventh District.

　　解决群众最迫切的问题
    记七区各界人民代表会议
    本报记者  培蓝
    京市七区第一次各界代表会议已经圆满闭幕。这次会议创造了一个重要经验，即：区人代会应该认真解决一两个群众当前最迫切的问题。在七区，劳动人民迫切要求改善环境卫生。这次代表会就着重解决了这个问题。
    七区位于崇文门外，北、东、南三面环城，地区偏僻，市政卫生建设简陋，是北京最穷苦的一区，该区大小三百一十九条道路中，没有一条沥青路或石子路，雨季泥泞难行。该区共有居民十万零五千多人，劳动群众居多。自来水很缺乏，只有十五个水站。据自来水公司在今年三月份统计，该区每月供水量为三千一百余吨，仅供八千五百多人饮用。大部分劳苦群众吃水感到很大困难。北水关一带的群众，要到广渠门去挑井水吃。每挑二百元。本区水井共有二十五处，经卫生试验所化验结果，其中十三个水井的水含有大肠菌。群众吃水既不经济，又不卫生。再加上本区大半个区没有臭水沟、秽水池，群众不免将脏水、粪便倾倒在街上，特别到了夏天，附近护城河、龙须沟及下水道的臭水四溢，街道上又脏又臭，蚊蝇繁殖，市民们每年因此闹传染病。
    敌伪及国民党匪帮统治时期，对劳动人民的健康是从来不管的。居民代表毛瑞年、赵松年说：“我们都是四十多岁的人，可从没见过敌伪政府为劳苦大众修建过一条马路。今天世道变了，共产党和人民政府，首先为劳动人民服务。”北京解放一年以来，政府首先在劳动人民聚居的第七区，改善市政卫生设备，疏浚护城河、龙须沟及大石桥下水道等，使常年臭水淤积街上的现象没有了。随后又在该区成立了妇婴保健所，并扩大了市立第四医院的一切设备，使劳苦群众可以减免费治疗。去年该区有三个产妇难产，经区公所介绍到市立医院去接生。
    这次七区各界代表会议，共收到群众的意见一千四百九十二条，其中有八百八十二条是关于公共卫生福利问题的。这些意见百分之六十以上被政府采纳了，并拟定了具体执行计划。如自来水供应问题，计划在该区增加干管三千四百余公尺，增设二十九处自来水站，并改造私井二十二处。根据群众的意见，和政府目前的经济力量，该区拟增建十三个公共厕所，修整旧有的公、私厕所；新建十八个并修理五个秽水池；新建五十三个渗水井，三个尿池。按装路灯一事，决定在有杆有线的地方，装修路灯八十六个，添装三十五个。代表苏孟春、李启贤、张凤山等提出修理崇外大街、蒜市口至广渠门、东大地至法华寺西段等四条路的建议，也得到圆满解决。市府建设局已计划把崇外大街修成沥青路，把广渠门至蒜市口、东大地至法华寺修成石路，把花市大街修成石渣路。代表们听了都热烈拥护这一计划。工人代表张化民说：“我们工人请求在七区设立一个工人诊疗所，结果政府给设立了两个，这证明了共产党完全是为人民着想的。只有在共产党领导下，劳动人民才能得到幸福！”代表们不仅积极向政府提出了意见，并且要把政府的意图传达给群众。有些地方不能马上按自来水管的，或不能设立水站的，道路不能马上修理的，代表们纷纷表示，回去一定给群众耐心解释。
    为了保证会议的决定胜利进行，并永远保持本区清洁卫生，政府和代表们共同订立了卫生公约。公约的条文是：（一）不任意倾倒秽水、垃圾及随地大小便，共同保护公共厕所、秽水池、渗水坑、护城河等公共卫生设施。（二）保持户内外的清洁，并清扫门前街道；摊贩应清扫其所在地方。（三）响应政府的号召，及时注射防疫针。这一公约得到全体代表的一致拥护，他们准备转达给全区群众遵照执行。
    七区代表会议的另一收获，是检查了干部的不良作风。“干部是人民的勤务员，勤务员当得好不好，要由群众来评定。”这是七区区长在代表会议上检讨干部作风时讲的。代表们感到自己的责任重大，要认真的提出自己的意见，该表扬的表扬，该批评的批评。十八段代表毛瑞年诚恳地表示：“今天政府的工作人员，一般都是全心全意为人民服务的；连那些从前在国民党反动政府里做过事的人，也变老实了。这完全是共产党教育的力量，这是毛主席的德政。就拿我们十八段的所长周万英同志说吧，他个人艰苦朴素，他女人自己纺羊毛生产。要是国民党时期，当个所长就阔了，大马金刀，早娶上姨太太了。”个别贪污腐化的干部，代表、群众也都提出了批评。七区公所，公安外三分局负责人都诚恳地作了检讨，并且说明政府曾经不断地对那些作风不良和贪污腐化的人员，根据错误的大小，分别进行了教育或处分。如法华寺摊贩管理处干部关子厚，平日作威作福，欺压群众，经常喝酒、买东西不给钱，严重地违犯政策，经区公所调查属实，即呈请市府，除令其偿还群众损失外，予以开除处分。第四零售店工作组长王福兴和他一组的组员们集体贪污，用小秤卖面。王福兴已送交法院判处徒刑三年，其余的也分别判处徒刑，并追还贪污款项。政府虚心的接受群众的批评，并立即纠正，使代表们感到，今天的政府，真正是自己的政府了。代表们一致表示，要与政府同心合力，共同建设新七区。
