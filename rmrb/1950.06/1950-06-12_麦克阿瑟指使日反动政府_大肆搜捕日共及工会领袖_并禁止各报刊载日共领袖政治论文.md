　　MacArthur Instructs Japanese Reactionary Government
    To Arrest Japanese Communist Party and Labor Union Leaders
    And Prohibit Newspapers from Publishing Political Essays by Japanese Communist Leaders
    [Xinhua News Agency, 11th] Under MacArthur's instruction, Japanese police have been conducting large-scale searches of the offices of the Japanese Communist Party and progressive labor unions, and unreasonably arresting members of the Japanese Communist Party. According to Tokyo dispatches from the United Press and Kyodo News Agency: Japanese police have searched the offices of thirty labor unions. On the 8th, fifty police officers and plainclothes agents conducted an illegal search for an hour and a half of the office jointly used by Japanese Communist Party leader Sanzo Nosaka and the Akahata newspaper's downtown office. Another Japanese Communist Party office in Tokyo, the private residence of another Japanese Communist Party leader, and the office of the Japanese Communist Party District Committee in Chiyoda Ward have all been subjected to illegal searches. The production studio of Toho Film Company in Tokyo was also searched. At the same time, the Japanese reactionary authorities successively arrested Toshio Hirai, chairman of the Japanese Communist Party's South Osaka branch, and Takeso Minamino, a Communist Party member, in Osaka. According to a Tokyo dispatch from the United Press on the 10th, the Japanese authorities have ordered newspapers and periodicals to be prohibited from publishing political essays by Japanese Communist Party leaders who have been illegally "purged." All published and sold works by Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Kyuichi Tokuda shall not be reprinted. In addition, after a five-hour meeting between Yoshida government cabinet members and U.S. occupation authorities officials on the 9th, it was decided to "extend indefinitely" the order prohibiting mass rallies in Tokyo.
