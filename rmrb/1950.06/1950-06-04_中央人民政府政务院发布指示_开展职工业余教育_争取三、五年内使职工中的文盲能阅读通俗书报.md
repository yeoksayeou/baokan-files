Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has recently issued instructions on carrying out workers' spare-time education. The full text is as follows:

Carrying out workers' spare-time education is one of the most important methods to improve the political, cultural, and technical level of the broad masses of workers and staff. Relevant departments of local people's governments, enterprise management agencies, and trade union organizations should conduct joint research in order to carry out this work in a planned, organized, and step-by-step manner. The following provisions are hereby formulated as the basis for carrying out this work in various localities:

(1) At present, the target of workers' spare-time education should focus on workers and staff in factories and enterprises, and the content of workers' spare-time education should focus on literacy education. Workers' education can take a variety of forms and maintain regularity.

	A. All factories and enterprises that have carried out political enlightenment education among workers for a certain period of time should now begin to carry out literacy campaigns in a planned manner, establish spare-time education general classes, and encourage illiterate workers to voluntarily enroll and learn, striving to enable existing illiterate workers to generally recognize around 1,000 characters and have the ability to read popular newspapers and periodicals within three to five years.

	B. Teachers for the general classes should mobilize literate staff, workers, and family members in their own factories and enterprises to serve, so that every literate person understands that "teaching others to read" is their unshirkable responsibility and glorious task. General class teachers should in principle be voluntary or semi-voluntary. Those who are particularly diligent and achieve good results should be given honorary and material rewards.

	C. The teaching methods of the general classes should be relatively flexible. There is no fixed classroom time, and classes can be conducted in workshops, dining halls, dormitories, pit entrances, and other places. The number of people in each class may also vary, but there must be a certain learning plan, organization, and system to complete a certain textbook for graduation.

	D. All schools near factories and enterprises should establish workers' spare-time education general classes as much as possible to assist the trade union organizations of nearby factories and enterprises in carrying out workers' literacy campaigns. Those who have achieved success in this work should be rewarded.

(2) In order to enable workers with a certain level of education to further improve, each factory and enterprise should, depending on the circumstances, conduct higher-level workers' spare-time cultural education. The methods are roughly as follows:

	A. Higher-level workers' spare-time cultural education should take a more formalized form, such as establishing spare-time education intermediate classes (equivalent to higher primary school, which workers who have graduated from general spare-time education classes or have a primary school education can enroll in), advanced classes (equivalent to middle school, which those who have graduated from intermediate spare-time education classes or have a higher primary school education can enroll in), etc., teaching major courses equivalent to those in ordinary schools.

	B. The study period is tentatively set at two years for intermediate classes and five years for advanced classes, but it may be extended or shortened depending on the learning situation. Those who pass the examination after completing the main courses will be issued a graduation certificate by the government education department, which has the same validity as a graduation certificate from an ordinary school with a comparable academic program.

	C. Intermediate and advanced spare-time education classes should hire fixed teachers, whose treatment should be roughly the same as that of ordinary schools.

(3) Political education for workers can be carried out through current affairs reports, special lectures, and other methods. In larger factories and enterprises, workers' spare-time political classes can be established to absorb workers with a certain level of education to participate in systematic political theory education, in order to cultivate cadres with preliminary theoretical knowledge among workers. The methods are as follows:

	A. Workers' spare-time political classes should teach the history of social development, the Chinese revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, the New Democracy and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a brief history of the world revolutionary movement, Soviet construction, labor policies and labor laws, etc., striving to complete the above basic political courses within two years.

	B. Teachers for spare-time political classes can be hired from responsible comrades in factories and enterprises and political teachers from local middle schools or above.

	C. Those who pass the examination after completing the above courses can be issued a graduation certificate from a workers' spare-time political class by the provincial and municipal government education departments. Those with excellent grades who are willing to pursue further studies can be recommended to apply for advanced political schools, such as Renmin University, the Marxist-Leninist Academy, etc.

(4) In order to further improve the technical level of workers and meet the needs of industrial production development for skilled workers, each factory and enterprise should, in consideration of the situation, conduct technical education in a planned manner. To this end, the following items should be noted:

	A. Technical workers in factories and enterprises should be mobilized to take on the glorious task of cultivating skilled workers for the country and voluntarily serve as technical instructors.

	B. The methods of conducting technical education can adopt forms such as technical training classes, technical research classes, or signing apprenticeship contracts, according to different requirements and conditions.

	C. Examinations should be held regularly, and those with excellent results should have their technical level upgraded and be given a certain bonus or remuneration to the teacher (in private enterprises, this can be stipulated in the labor-capital collective contract or decided by the labor-capital consultation meeting).

(5) Workers' spare-time education is a huge task, which should be led by the government education departments, relying on trade union organizations, and jointly carried out by all relevant parties. To this end, a unified leadership organization must be established. It is hereby decided:

	A. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, together with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, will invite the Ministry of Labor and other relevant parties to organize a Workers' Spare-Time Education Committee to discuss and decide on major matters related to the national workers' spare-time education, such as guidelines, plans, curriculum, funding, and systems.

	B. Local education departments (bureaus), together with local trade union federations, will invite local labor departments (bureaus) and other relevant parties to organize local workers' spare-time education committees to discuss matters related to workers' spare-time education in the region.

	C. The representatives of the government education departments at all levels shall be the directors of the workers' spare-time education committees at all levels, and the representatives of the trade union organizations at all levels shall be the deputy directors. Their decisions shall be promulgated by the government education departments at all levels.

	D. Within factories and enterprises, the trade union shall be responsible for carrying out the workers' spare-time education work within the factory or enterprise under the guidance of the local workers' spare-time education committee. The administration or capital of the factory or enterprise shall provide all necessary and possible assistance.

(6) The funds for workers' spare-time education shall be drawn from 60% of the cultural and educational expenses allocated by each factory and enterprise to the trade union, and the shortfall shall be made up by a certain amount allocated from the educational funds of governments at all levels as subsidies. The expenditure of funds shall be limited to teachers' salaries, allowances, bonuses, textbook subsidies, and other miscellaneous expenses, and waste should be avoided.

(7) Factories and enterprises should make every effort to provide or lend the necessary houses and equipment for spare-time education.

(8) Study time should be conducted outside of working hours. General classes and technical classes must have at least two studies per week; intermediate classes, advanced classes, and political classes must have at least three studies per week, each lasting at least ninety minutes. Those who participate in studies on study days may not be subject to extra overtime and are exempt from participating in various meeting activities.

(9) The textbooks for general classes and political classes shall be edited by the editorial committee organized by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Ministry of Labor, and the General Administration of Publications. The textbooks for intermediate and advanced classes can adopt the textbooks of equivalent ordinary schools or workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools, but the content must be streamlined. Technical textbooks and supplementary textbooks can be compiled by teachers and submitted to the workers' spare-time education committees at all levels for review.

(10) This instruction shall also apply to the spare-time education of workers with low cultural levels in various agencies.

(11) After receiving this instruction, the government education departments and local trade union organizations in various localities should convene all relevant parties as soon as possible to establish workers' spare-time education committees to plan and promote the implementation of this work.

　　中央人民政府政务院发布指示
    开展职工业余教育
    争取三、五年内使职工中的文盲能阅读通俗书报
    【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府政务院顷发布关于开展职工业余教育的指示，全文如下：
    开展职工业余教育是提高广大工人职员群众的政治、文化与技术水平的最重要方法之一。各地人民政府有关部门、企业管理机关及工会组织应进行共同研究，以便有计划、有组织、有步骤地来开展这一工作。兹规定下列各项，作为各地开展这一工作的依据：
    （一）目前职工业余教育的对象以工厂企业中的工人职员为主，职工业余教育的内容以识字教育为重点。职工教育可采取多种多样并能保持经常的方式来进行。
    甲、凡已经在职工中进行过一定时期的政治启蒙教育的工厂、企业，现在都应开始有计划地展开识字运动，设立业余教育普通班，鼓励不识字的职工自动报名学习，争取在三、五年内做到职工中现有的文盲一般能认识一千字上下，并具有阅读通俗书报的能力。
    乙、普通班的教员，应动员本工厂企业中识字的职员、工人和家属担任，要使每一个识字的人了解“教人识字”是自己义不容辞的责任和光荣的任务。普通班教员原则上应为义务职或半义务职，对特别努力而有成绩者，应予以名誉的和物质的奖励。
    丙、普通班的教学方式应该比较灵活，无一定的课堂时，得在工场、饭厅、宿舍、坑口等处进行。每班的人数也可不拘多少，但均须有一定的学习计划、组织与制度，以学完一定的课本为毕业。
    丁、凡在工厂、企业附近的学校，都应尽可能设立职工业余教育普通班，协助附近工厂、企业的工会组织，开展职工识字运动。凡进行这一工作有成绩者，应予以奖励。
    （二）为了使职工中具有相当文化程度者，能得到进一步的提高，各工厂、企业应根据情况举办较高级的职工业余文化教育，其办法大致如下：
    甲、较高级的职工业余文化教育，应采取比较正规化的形式，如设立业余教育中级班（其程度等于高小，凡业余教育普通班毕业或具有小学文化程度的职工即可入学）、高级班（等于中学，凡在业余教育中级班毕业或具有高小毕业文化程度者即可入学）等，教以相当于普通学校的主要课程。
    乙、学习期限，暂定中级班两年毕业，高级班五年毕业，但得根据学习情况延长或缩短之。凡修完主要课程后测验及格者，即可由政府教育部门发给毕业证书，其效力同于与其学程相当的普通学校毕业证书。
    丙、业余教育中级班与高级班，均应聘请固定的教员，其待遇应与普通学校大致相同。
    （三）对职工的政治教育，可以用时事报告、专题讲演等方式来进行。在比较大的工厂、企业中，可设立职工业余政治班，吸收有相当文化程度的职工参加，进行有系统的政治理论教育，以培养职工中具有初步理论知识的干部。其办法如下：
    甲、职工业余政治班应讲授社会发展史、中国革命与中国共产党、新民主主义与人民政协共同纲领、世界革命运动简史、苏联建设、劳动政策与劳动法令等，争取在二年内学完上述基本政治课程。
    乙、业余政治班的教员，得聘请工厂、企业中的负责同志及当地中等以上学校的政治教员担任。
    丙、凡学完上述课程测验及格者，可由省、市级政府教育部门发给职工业余政治班毕业证书。其中成绩优异愿意深造者，可介绍投考高级政治学校，如人民大学、马列学院等。
    （四）为了进一步提高职工技术水平，适应工业生产发展中对于技术工人的需要，现在各工厂企业应斟酌情形有计划地进行技术教育。为此，应注意下列各项：
    甲、应动员工厂、企业中的技术员工，负起为国家培养技术工人的光荣任务，自愿地担任技术教员。
    乙、进行技术教育的方式，可按不同的要求与条件，采用技术训练班、技术研究班或订立师徒合同等形式。
    丙、应定期举行考试，成绩优良者，提升其技术等级，并发给教者一定奖金或报酬（在私营企业中，可在劳资集体合同中予以规定或由劳资协商会议决定之）。
    （五）职工业余教育是一件巨大的工作，应由政府教育部门负责领导，依靠工会组织，联合各有关方面协力进行。为此，必须建立统一的领导组织，兹决定：
    甲、中央人民政府教育部会同中华全国总工会邀集劳动部及其他有关方面，组织职工业余教育委员会，讨论及决定有关全国职工业余教育的方针、计划、课程、经费、制度等重大事项。
    乙、各地教育厅（局）会同地方总工会邀集劳动厅（局）及其他有关方面，组织地方职工业余教育委员会，讨论有关该地区职工业余教育事项。
    丙、各级职工业余教育委员会，以各级政府教育部门的代表为主任，各级工会组织的代表为副主任。其决定由各级政府教育部门发布之。
    丁、在工厂、企业内、由工会负责，在当地职工业余教育委员会指导之下，进行各该工厂、企业内之职工业余教育工作。工厂、企业的行政或资方应给予一切必要而可能的帮助。
    （六）职工业余教育的经费，由各工厂、企业拨交工会的文教费中提出百分之六十，其不足之数再由各级政府教育经费中拨出一定数额，作为补助费。经费的开支，以教员的薪金、津贴、奖金、课本补助费和其他杂费为限，应避免浪费。
    （七）各工厂、企业应尽可能设法供给或借给业余教育所必需的房屋和设备。
    （八）学习时间应在工作时间以外进行。普通班和技术班每周至少须有两次学习；中级班、高级班和政治班每周至少须有三次学习，每次至少九十分钟。在学习日参加学习者，可不作额外加班，并免除其参加各种会议活动的工作。
    （九）普通班、政治班的教材，由中央人民政府教育部、中华全国总工会协同劳动部、出版总署组织编辑委员会编辑之。中级班、高级班教材，可采用相当的普通学校或工农速成中学的教材，但内容须加精简。技术教材及补充教材，可由教员编写，送交各级职工业余教育委员会审订。
    （十）各种机关中文化水平较低之职工的业余教育亦得适用本指示。
    （十一）各地接到本指示后，应由政府教育部门与各地工会组织召集各有关方面尽速成立职工业余教育委员会计划并推动此项工作之进行。
   总理  周恩来  一九五零年六月一日
