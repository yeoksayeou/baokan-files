Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 17th: The Xinjiang Province Peace and Democracy League held its first representative conference from the 3rd to the 8th of this month. The purpose of the meeting was to consolidate and expand the democratic united front of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. A total of 152 official and specially invited representatives attended the meeting. The meeting unanimously adopted the political report of the New League Chairman Saifuddin, and based on the report and current practical needs, reorganized the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy League into the Xinjiang People's Democratic League, and passed a new league charter. The league charter stipulates that in the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it will work in the organizational form of a democratic united front of all ethnic groups in the province, in accordance with the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the current administrative policies of the Provincial People's Government. The meeting also enthusiastically accepted the proposal of the Boeshe Society, the Xinjiang Democratic Youth League, and the General Association for the Promotion of Culture of Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Hui, Uzbek, Tatar, Mongolian, Russian, Xibe, and Solun nationalities to join the new league. The meeting elected 51 members of the General Committee, 10 alternate members, and from the General Committee, Saifuddin, Saifullaev, Deng Liqun, Anniwar, Rao Zhengxi, Daxiafu, Bao Erhan, He Rui, Aisihaiti, Yao Wen, Yu Zhanlin, Chen Xigou, Weiguer, Jakulin, Abuduke Reimu and other 15 executive committee members, Abudul Hamiti and Yibulayin two alternate executive committee members, to form the General Executive Committee, and elected Saifuddin as the chairman of the General Committee and Executive Committee of the New League, and He Rui, Abuduke Reimu, and Jakulin as vice-chairmen. The meeting also elected Abudula Razakr, Nizamding, Chen Baoshan, Abudula Reheman, Delin, Awukan, and Ziya as seven members of the Supervisory Committee to form the Supervisory Committee, with Abudula Razakr as the chairman. The meeting enthusiastically adopted congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government, Chairman Peng Dehuai of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the Xinjiang Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, as well as a letter to members of the New League and the people of Xinjiang. In order to commemorate Ahamaiti Jiang, who sacrificed his life for the revolution, the meeting decided to collect his posthumous works and publish a special collection, and suggested that the People's Government rename Yining City as Ahamaiti Jiang City.
    Chairman Saifuddin made a concluding report at the closing meeting, pointing out that in the future, the Xinjiang People's Democratic League will complete the social reform of Xinjiang and liberate the working people who are still under the oppression of feudal forces under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. To this end, the New League organization should be further strengthened and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out enthusiastically. Every member of the league should work hard to learn from the working people, arm our minds with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and serve the people well.
    A Brief History of the New League
    Note: The outstanding members and leaders of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, in order to oppose the national oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, launched an uprising in Yining in 1944, liberated the three districts of Yili, Ashan, and Tacheng, and established their own political power and army of all ethnic groups - the National Army, now the Fifth Army of the People's Liberation Army, restrained 100,000 troops of the Kuomintang reactionaries, directly cooperated with the national People's Liberation War, and became a part of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution. In 1948, under the leadership of Ahamaiti Jiang, the Xinjiang Province Peace and Democracy League was established, which finalized the united front organizationally, strengthened the leadership of the National Army, and promoted the political, economic, cultural, and educational development of the three districts. At the same time, it carried out publicity and education among the people of Xinjiang on the consistency between the Chinese People's Liberation War and the Xinjiang People's Liberation War. Last year, the outstanding leaders and cadres of the New League, Ahamaiti Jiang, Isihak Beck, Abbasov, and others, were killed in a plane crash while participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The entire league inherited their unfinished cause, strengthened the unity of all ethnic groups in the country and the unification of the people's motherland, encouraged the people of Xinjiang, warmly welcomed and supported the People's Liberation Army, and decided to join the great ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Now, in order to adapt to the new stage of the Xinjiang People's Revolution and unite the working people of all ethnic groups against feudal forces, a reorganization is implemented to develop and improve the united front of all ethnic groups against the Kuomintang reactionaries into a united front of democratic people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The League stated: As long as they agree to oppose feudal forces, they can participate in the united front. The Xinjiang People's Democratic League will take the New Democracy theory and the Common Program of the CPPCC as the political basis, faithfully implement the policy of the people's democratic united front stipulated by the CCP Central Committee, and conduct extensive and sincere cooperation with all patriotic democrats and those who care for the future of all ethnic groups. At the same time, after joining the great ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the National Army now adopts and will thoroughly implement all the systems of the People's Liberation Army, making itself truly an army of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups.

    新盟简史
    按：新疆各族人民的优秀分子及其领袖，为反对国民党反动派的民族压迫，于一九四四年在伊宁举行起义，解放了伊犁、阿山、塔城三个区，建立了各族人民自己的政权和军队——民族军，即现在的人民解放军第五军，牵制了国民党反动派的十万军队，直接配合了全国的人民解放战争，成为中国人民民主革命的一部分。一九四八年，在阿哈买提江领导下，成立了新疆省保卫和平民主同盟，使统一战线在组织上最后形成，并加强了对民族军的领导，推进了三个区的政治、经济与文化教育的发展。同时对中国人民解放战争与新疆人民解放战争的一致性，在新疆人民中作了宣传教育。去年，新盟优秀领袖和干部阿哈买提江、伊司哈克伯克、阿巴索夫等五人在参加中国人民政协途中因飞机失事遇难后，全盟继承他们未竟的事业，为加强全国各族人民的团结和人民祖国的统一，鼓舞全疆人民，热烈欢迎与拥护人民解放军，并决定民族军加入中国人民解放军的伟大行列。现为适应新疆人民革命的新阶段，团结各族劳动人民反对封建势力，乃实行改组，借使各民族反对国民党反动派的统一战线，发展提高为全新疆各民族人民民主的统一战线。该盟表示：今后只要赞成反对封建势力，都可参加到统一战线中来。新疆人民民主同盟将以新民主主义理论及政协共同纲领作为政治基础，忠实执行中共中央所规定的人民民主统一战线的政策，与一切爱国民主人士以及爱护各民族前途的人士进行广泛的真诚的合作。同时，民族军在参加到中国人民解放军伟大行列之后，现在采用并将彻底实行人民解放军的一切制度，使自己真正成为中国各族人民自己的军队。
