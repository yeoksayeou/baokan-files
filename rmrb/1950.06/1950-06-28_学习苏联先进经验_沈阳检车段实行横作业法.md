Learning from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union
    Shenyang Inspection Section Implements Horizontal Operation Method
    [Our Newspaper] The Shenyang Inspection Section of the China Changchun Railway learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implemented the horizontal operation method for the inspection and repair of freight cars on April 5th, with very good results. The characteristic of the horizontal operation method is the implementation of the responsibility system. Every person or unit participating in the work is clearly assigned specific tasks, fundamentally overcoming the phenomenon of missed inspections and repairs with no one responsible. During the operation process, the vertical and horizontal connections are also closer than in the past. For example, in the horizontal operation method of freight cars, from the incoming line inspection to the completion inspection, the inspection director, foreman, workers, and inspectors, as well as all the repair progress, are all implementing joint labor and mutual assistance on the basis of the responsibility system. After the section implemented the horizontal operation method, the number of vehicles repaired in April exceeded the plan by 38 percent. Accidents due to negligence decreased by 60 percent compared with February. The inspection of 30 trains only took 25 to 26 minutes. Replacing a brake beam could be completed in four minutes. The train inspection was completed before the shunting operation, greatly promoting the work.

　　学习苏联先进经验
    沈阳检车段实行横作业法
    【本报讯】中长路沈阳检车段学习苏联先进经验，于四月五日实行列车货车检修的横作业法，成绩很好。横作业法的特点是贯彻了负责制，每一个参加工作的人或工作单位，都明确分配一定的具体工作，根本克服了漏检、漏修等无人负责的现象。作业过程中，纵横的联系也比过去更加密切。譬如货车的横作业法从入线检查到落成检查止，检车主任、工长、工友、验收员之间，及所有的检修进度上，全是在负责制的基础上实行联合劳动与互相帮助的。该段实行横作业法后，四月份完成的检修车辆已超过计划百分之三十八，责任事故较二月份减少百分之六十，列车检修三十辆只用二十五、六分钟，换制动梁四分钟就能换完，列检比调车提前做完，大大推动了工作。
