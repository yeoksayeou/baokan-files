Read Kalinin's Reports Several Times
    Li Zhi

    Editor's Note: The "On Communist Education" (Chinese edition) published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House contains thirty speeches by Kalinin from 1926 to 1945. These speeches were mainly directed at members of the Communist Youth League and students, and some were aimed at Party workers and educators. The content mainly discusses the work and study problems of young people, and some discuss political mobilization and education. Each piece is rich in meaning and narrated in a kind, vivid, and specific manner. Therefore, this is an excellent reading material for studying Marxism-Leninism, which should be read not only by young people but also by general Party and government workers and educators. This article is reprinted from the 59th issue of "Life Knowledge" published by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore, with slight modifications to the text.

    The "On Communist Education" published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House for our Chinese readers, most of which are reports to the Communist Youth League. With his rich revolutionary experience and profound Marxist-Leninist insights, Kalinin teaches us in a popular and vivid way how to specifically study and apply Marxism-Leninism and how to correctly train ourselves. When we read it, it is as if Kalinin is standing in front of us giving a lecture, which is even more moving than listening to a touching story. As long as we think about it carefully, every word Kalinin says is like a sharp weapon, adding infinite power to our ideological arsenal.

    Learning is the most important task for young people. Regarding the learning problems of young people, Kalinin, with his rich experience in diligent self-study, explains that the complaint of "no time for self-study" is not justified. He uses his own example to teach young people: as long as they "can correctly allocate their time," then the learning time "is quite sufficient." He said: "I am also a very busy person, but at the same time, I have to take time to read every day. I read at least eight or nine pages of Marxist books, not documents, every day, and in addition, I read some newly published literary works." Why is he so enthusiastic about learning? The reason is very simple. He tells us: "In order to be able to move forward with the vigorous development of our country's life, it is not enough to just work enthusiastically." That is to say, to move forward, we must learn. Only in this way can we completely grasp the weapons given to us by the revolutionary teachers and leaders.

    Kalinin not only teaches us to attach importance to theoretical learning from books, but also teaches us to be good at learning from life, and to always pay attention to linking daily work with theory. In his words, it is necessary to "enrich theory with life" and "become creators." Because Marxism is creative, if we want to become Marxists, we must specifically apply Marxist methods in practical life; otherwise, we are not worthy of being called Marxists. In order to profoundly explain this point, he said in a report: "For example, there are two students taking an exam. One student answers very accurately according to the textbook, and the other student's answer is very similar to what is written in the textbook, and is correct in essence, but the wording is not consistent with the book. Then how would I evaluate the performance of these two students? I will definitely believe the second student's insights more, and I will give him no less marks than the first student who memorizes the book." This means that our learning is for usefulness, and the learning viewpoints and methods that are divorced from reality and memorize the articles by rote must be resolutely corrected.

    In many reports, Kalinin teaches us how to "enrich theory with life" and how to specifically grasp and apply Marxist-Leninist methods to deal with problems by talking about how we should speak and write articles. Kalinin believes that learning to express one's own opinions in one's own words is the first lesson of true Marxism. He repeatedly tells us: don't say ready-made words. He compares those who like to say ready-made words to lazy people who use their tongues without using their brains; and he compares these words to "a moon that seems to be unable to give sun." What is saying ready-made words? That is "to speak in ready-made formulas,... the brain does not work, but only the tongue is working." Kalinin warns us: "If you say a ready-made set of words, you cannot impress people,... because this set of words does not need you to say, everyone knows it." How should we speak? Kalinin believes that we should speak in our own opinions and in our own tone, especially to think about every sentence we say, because only when we think clearly can we speak clearly; only in this way can words excite people and move people.

    The same should be true of writing articles. Kalinin believes that it is very harmful to write articles without one's own ideas and sentences, because in this way, "one will not learn anything in one's life." He said: "It doesn't matter if you write badly, but you must be original. Even if you have to revise what you write yourself a thousand times and rewrite it a hundred times, you must not be afraid of this, and you must not spare your strength. This is to make you learn to work independently, and the so-called spirit of independence is also manifested here."

    In order to speak better and write better, that is, in order to improve culture and work better, Kalinin wants us to pay special attention to learning the national language. He said: "Learning the national language is a major event. If people cannot clearly form their own ideas with language, then the highest achievements of human thought, the deepest knowledge, and the most ardent feelings cannot be known." He uses a love story as a metaphor: "A young man wants to write a letter to his lover. ... He writes: 'Dear, I love you endlessly. ... I don't know what words can express it.' ... If she is not a naive girl ... but a very knowledgeable girl ... this girl will definitely say: 'Poor child, why is your head so stupid!'" Learning the national language is especially important for our young people. Some people think that they don't want to be writers, so they don't need to work hard to learn the national language. This idea is wrong.

    Each speech and essay in this book educates us so profoundly and specifically. It teaches us how to specifically recognize and solve problems with Marxist-Leninist methods. Therefore, I suggest that young people and Youth League comrades read it several times.

　　多读几遍加里宁的报告
    力知
    编者按：莫斯科外国文书籍出版局印行的“论共产主义教育”（中文本），包含加里宁从一九二六年到一九四五年间的三十篇讲演录。这些讲演，主要以共产主义青年团团员和学生为对象，一部分以党务工作者和教育工作者为对象。内容多半讲青年的工作和学习问题，一部分讲政治鼓动、讲教育。每一篇文字，含义都极丰富，叙述得又亲切，生动，具体。所以这是一册极好的学习马列主义的读物，不但青年们应当读，一般的党政工作者、教育工作者都应当读。本文转载东北新华书店出版“生活知识”第五十九期，文字上略有修改。
    莫斯科外国文书籍出版局，为我们中国读者印行的“论共产主义教育”，其中大部分是对共产主义青年团的报告。加里宁以其丰富的革命经验，和深刻的马列主义见解，通俗而又生动地教导我们怎样具体学习和运用马列主义，如何正确地锻炼自己。当我们读它的时候，就好像加里宁站在我们面前讲演一样，比听动人的故事还动人。只要我们好好地加以思索，加里宁所说的每一句话就都像是锐利的武器，给我们的思想武库增加无限的力量。
    学习是青年最主要的任务。关于青年的学习问题，加里宁以其刻苦自修的丰富经验，说明“没有时间自修”的诉苦是不应该的，他以自己的例子教导青年人：只要“能正确地分配自己的时间”，那么学习时间“也是很够用的”。他说：“我也是个工作很忙的人，但同时我每天都要分时间来看书。我每天至少要读八九页不是文件，而是马克思主义的书籍，除此以外，还要看些新出版的文艺作品。”他为什么还要这样地热心学习呢？道理很简单，他这样告诉我们：“为要能随着我国蓬勃生活的发展而前进，只是热烈工作是不够的。”这就是说，要前进就必须学习，只有这样才能完备地把握着革命导师与领袖们所赋予我们的武器。
    加里宁不仅教导我们要重视书本方面的理论学习，并且还教导我们要善于从生活中来学习，时刻都要注意把日常工作与理论联系起来。用他的话来说，就是要“用生活来充实理论”，“要成为创作家”。因为马克思主义是创造性的，我们要想成为马克思主义者，就必须在实际生活中具体运用马克思主义的方法，不然的话，就不配称为马克思主义者。加里宁为了深刻说明这一点，他在一次报告中说：“譬如说，有两个学员来受考试。一个学员按教科书回答得非常准确，另一个学员所回答的，与教科书上写的很相近，实质上正确，但与书本上的措辞并不一致。那么我会怎样估量这两个学员的成绩呢？我定会更相信第二个学员的心得，我给他的分数无论如何也不比给第一个凭记忆力背书的学员少些。”这就是说，我们的学习是为了有用，那种脱离实际，死背条文的学习观点和学习方法，必须坚决加以纠正。
    加里宁在好多报告中，都以应该怎样说话和写文章，教导我们如何“用生活来充实理论”，如何具体掌握与运用马列主义的方法来对待问题。加里宁认为学会用自己的话表达自己的意见，这是真正马克思主义的第一课。他再三地告诉我们：不要说现成的话。他把这种好说现成的话的人，比作不用脑筋光用舌头的懒汉；并且把这种话比作“好像是晒不了人的月亮”。什么叫说现成话呢？那就是“用现成的公式来讲话，…脑筋没有起作用，而只是舌头在起作用。”加里宁警惕我们说：“说现成的一套话，你们就不能使人家发生印象，……因为这套话用不着你们说，大家也知道。”应该怎样说话法呢？加里宁认为应该用自己的意见和自己的口气来讲话，特别是要把自己所讲的每句话都加以思考，因为只有想得清楚，才能说得明白；这样的话，才能激动人和感动人。
    关于写文章，也应该如此。加里宁认为不用自己的意思和自己造的句子写文章，是非常有害的，因为这样，“一辈子连什么东西也学不会”。他说：“不妨写得坏些，但是一定要自出心裁。即使你们必得把亲自写作的东西修改一千次，重写一百遍，但你们决不要因此害怕，也不要吝惜自己的力量。这就是要使你们学会独立工作，所谓独立自主精神也就表现在这里。”
    为了把话说得好一些，把文章写得好一些，也就是说，为了把文化更提高，把工作作得更好些，加里宁要我们特别重视学习国语。他说：“学习国语——这是一件大事。如果人们不能用语言明确构成自己的意思，那末人类思想的最高成绩，最深刻的知识和最热烈的心情，都无法使人知道。”他用恋爱故事譬喻说：“一个青年人很想写封信给自己的情人。……他写道：‘亲爱的，我爱你爱得没有止境。……我不知道用什么话才能表达出来。’……假如她不是一个幼稚的姑娘……而是一个很有学识的姑娘……这姑娘一定会说：‘可怜的孩子啊，你的脑袋怎么这样笨啊！’”学习国语，对我们青年来说尤其是重要。有些人认为自己不想做著作家，用不着下苦工学国语，这种想法是不对的。
    这本书里的每一篇讲演和论文，都这样深刻和具体地教育着我们。它教给我们怎样具体地以马列主义的方法认识问题和解决问题。因此，我建议青年们和青年团员同志们多读它几遍。
