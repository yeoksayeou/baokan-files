Thoroughly Implement the Trade Union Law

    The Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China has been adopted and promulgated for implementation by the Central People's Government Committee. This Trade Union Law concentrates the will and demands of the people of the whole country, especially the broad masses of workers, and stipulates the extensive rights granted to trade union organizations by the state. Thoroughly implementing this Trade Union Law will promote the faster development of trade union organizations and further enhance the consciousness of the working class, which is of decisive significance to my country's economic construction.

    The rights granted to trade union organizations by the state, as stipulated in this Trade Union Law, are very broad. It stipulates that "in state-owned and cooperative enterprises, trade unions have the right to represent the employed workers and staff in participating in production management and concluding collective contracts with the administrative side." "In private enterprises, trade unions have the right to represent the employed workers and staff in conducting negotiations and bargaining with the capitalists, participating in labor-capital consultation meetings, and concluding collective contracts with the capitalists." And when the enterprise administration or the capitalists' employment and dismissal of workers violates the decrees of the People's Government or the collective contract, the grassroots trade union committee has the right to protest. In short, trade unions retain the right to supervise the administrative side of state-owned enterprises and the capitalists of private enterprises to conscientiously implement all labor protection laws and regulations promulgated by the government. This Trade Union Law also stipulates that governments at all levels, administrative departments, and capitalists should provide trade union organizations with various material assistance and allocate 2% of the total actual wage of all employed workers and staff to the trade union organization monthly as trade union funds. With such extensive rights and assistance, the work of trade unions will undoubtedly develop more smoothly.

    Why does the People's Government grant trade union organizations these rights and provide them with this assistance?

    This is because: The working class is now the leading class of our country. The goal of all the work of our country is to gradually industrialize the country. The working class is precisely the main force of national industrialization. In any city, employed laborers and their families account for more than half of the urban population. The People's Government must first rely on the working class to carry out its work, and the specific content of relying on the working class is to rely on trade unions, because "trade unions are mass organizations voluntarily formed by the working class." The government provides trade unions with all necessary rights and working conditions, so that trade unions can organize all employed laborers, which can become the most important pillar of the People's Government in the cities. In the past, when the working class struggled against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, it deeply realized the importance of unity. Today, after overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary rule and driving out the forces of imperialism in China, national construction has become the basic task of the working class, and it is even more urgent to organize in order to better play the role of the leading class and unite the people of the whole country to build a new country. The government grants trade unions all necessary rights, which is completely in line with the will and tasks of the working class.

    In order to earnestly rely on the working class to carry out production and construction, governments at all levels, administrative leaders of state-owned enterprises, and capitalists of private enterprises must thoroughly implement the Trade Union Law. Governments at all levels should provide trade union organizations with various assistance in terms of material and working conditions. Administrative leaders of state-owned enterprises should fully support the trade unions. The working class is the master of state-owned enterprises, and administrative leaders must rely on the enthusiasm of the working class to run the enterprises well. Trade unions are the schools of the working class. The quality of trade union work directly affects the enthusiasm of workers, and thus directly affects the success or failure of the entire enterprise. There are still some administrative leaders of state-owned enterprises who know that they must rely on the working class, but they do not understand the role of trade unions. As a result, they unconsciously replace the trade unions and attempt to mobilize the masses of workers from top to bottom, often with results that are contrary to their wishes. They must recognize that trade unions have the right to represent workers in participating in production management, the right to supervise the administrative side to conscientiously implement the government's labor laws and regulations, and the right to request the administrative authorities at the same level to report their work to the trade unions. Now, these rights of the trade unions have been clearly stipulated by the Trade Union Law, and administrative leaders should support the trade unions so that the trade unions can fully exercise these rights and participate in the democratic management of the enterprises. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the workers be fully mobilized and the goal of developing production be achieved. The capitalists of private enterprises should also conscientiously implement the Trade Union Law. The Trade Union Law stipulates that trade unions have the right to supervise the capitalists to conscientiously implement all labor protection laws and regulations promulgated by the government. The purpose of this provision is to make the capitalists pay attention to the interests and opinions of the workers, change the previous management methods of oppressing and coercing the workers, and realize their own management rights through democratic methods. Trade unions represent workers, participate in labor-capital consultation meetings, and conclude collective contracts with capitalists. In this way, under the principle of mutual benefit between labor and capital, labor and capital can be in a condition of equality, voluntariness, mutual benefit, and contractual agreement, and the production enthusiasm of the workers can be mobilized, which is also beneficial to the capitalists.

    The promulgation of the Trade Union Law will enable the working class to further recognize its position as the master in the new country. Such a Trade Union Law can only be promulgated by people's democratic countries and socialist countries. Only under the people's regime can the working masses obtain such political rights. In capitalist countries, the rights of the working class are being subjected to increasingly urgent attacks. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese working class united with other democratic strata and fought heroically for nearly 30 years, finally overthrowing the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and establishing a new democratic country. The working class has changed from a position of being oppressed and enslaved to the leading class of the country. After liberation, workers in various places spontaneously launched production emulation campaigns and created new production records. The production efficiency of many enterprises quickly recovered and exceeded the pre-war level. The working class not only demonstrated its role in the revolutionary struggle, but also demonstrated its role on the production front. The promulgation of this Trade Union Law, which protects the rights of workers, will make the working class more consciously recognize the flesh-and-blood relationship between themselves and the people's regime they have built with their own hands, and will further safeguard the laws and regulations of the People's Government and promote the policies of the People's Government, so as to consolidate the people's regime led by the working class. And under the leadership of the trade unions, actively produce, create conditions for national industrialization, and strive for their long-term interests.

### 彻底实施工会法

　　彻底实施工会法
    中华人民共和国工会法已由中央人民政府委员会通过，并颁布施行。这个工会法集中了全国人民，首先是广大工人群众的意志与要求，规定了国家赋予工会组织的广泛权利。彻底实施这个工会法，将可以推动工会组织更快地发展，进一步提高工人阶级的觉悟，这，对于我国的经济建设，实有决定的意义。
    这个工会法规定的国家赋予工会组织的权利，是非常广泛的。其中规定：“在国营及合作社经营的企业中，工会有代表受雇工人、职员群众参加生产管理及与行政方面缔结集体合同之权。”“在私营企业中，工会有代表受雇工人、职员群众与资方进行交涉、谈判、参加劳资协商会议并与资方缔结集体合同之权。”而在企业行政或资方雇用与解雇工人有违反人民政府法令或集体合同情事时，工会基层委员会有抗议权。总之，工会保有监督国营企业行政方面与私营企业的资方切实执行政府所颁布的一切保护劳动法令的权利。这个工会法同时规定了各级政府、行政方面和资方应给予工会组织以各种物质上的帮助，并按所雇全部职工实际工资总额的百分之二，按月拨交工会组织，作为工会的经费。工会获得这种广泛的权利和帮助，它的工作，无疑地会有更加顺利的发展。
    人民政府为什么赋予工会组织这些权利，并给予它这些帮助呢？
    这是因为：工人阶级现在是我们国家的领导阶级。我们国家全部工作的努力目标，是使国家逐步走向工业化。工人阶级正是国家工业化的主力。在任何一个城市中，雇佣劳动者加上他们的家属，都占城市人口的半数以上。人民政府必须首先依靠工人阶级推行自己的工作，而依靠工人阶级的具体内容，则是依靠工会，因为“工会是工人阶级自愿结合的群众组织”。政府给予工会各种必要的权利和工作上的便利条件，使工会能把所有的雇佣劳动者组织起来，便可成为人民政府在城市中的最主要的支柱。工人阶级过去在与帝国主义和国民党反动统治者作斗争的时候，曾经深刻地认识到团结的重要。今天，在推翻了国民党反动统治，赶走了帝国主义在中国的势力之后，建设国家成为工人阶级的基本任务，更迫切要求组织起来，以便更好地发挥领导阶级的作用，团结全国人民建设新的国家。政府给予工会一切必要的权利，是完全符合于工人阶级的意志与任务的。
    为了认真作到依靠工人阶级进行生产建设，各级政府，国营企业的行政负责人以及私营企业的资方，必须彻底执行工会法。各级政府应该在物质条件及工作条件方面，给予工会组织以各种帮助。国营企业的行政负责人，更应全力支持工会。工人阶级是国营企业的主人，行政负责人必须依靠工人阶级的积极性，才能把企业办好。工会是工人阶级的学校，工会工作的好坏，直接影响着工人的积极性，因而也直接影响整个企业的成败。现在还有一部分国营企业的行政负责人，他们也知道必须依靠工人阶级，但是却不了解工会的作用。于是，他们不自觉地代替了工会，企图从上而下地发动工人群众，结果常常事与愿违。他们必须认识：工会有代表工人参加生产管理的权利，有监督行政方面切实执行政府的劳动法令的权利，有要求同级行政当局向工会报告工作的权利。现在，工会这些权利已由工会法明确规定，行政负责人应该支持工会，使工会能充分运用这些权利，参加企业的民主管理。只有如此，才能把工人的积极性充分发动起来，达到发展生产的目的。私营企业的资方也应该切实执行工会法。工会法规定：工会有监督资方切实执行政府所颁布的一切保护劳动的法令的权利。这样规定的目的，是使资方重视工人的利益与意见，改变以前压迫强制工人的管理办法，用民主的方法实现资方自己的管理权。工会代表工人，参加劳资协商会议，与资方缔结集体合同。这样，就可以在劳资两利的原则下，劳资双方处于平等、自愿、两利、订立契约的条件下，把工人的生产积极性发动起来，对于资方也是有利的。
    工会法的颁布，将使工人阶级进一步认识自己在新国家中主人翁的地位。像这样的工会法，只有人民民主国家和社会主义国家才能颁布，只有在人民政权之下，工人群众才能获得这样的政治权利。在资本主义国家中，工人阶级的权利正在遭受日益紧迫的进攻。中国工人阶级在共产党领导下，团结其他民主阶层，英勇奋斗近三十年，终于推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治，建立了新民主主义的国家，工人阶级已由被压迫被奴役的地位，变成国家的领导阶级。解放以后，各地工人曾自发地开展生产竞赛运动，创造生产新纪录，许多企业的生产效率迅速恢复并超过了战前水平，工人阶级不仅表现了自己在革命斗争中的作用，而且表现了自己在生产战线的作用。这一保护工人权利的工会法的颁布，会使工人阶级更自觉地认识自己和自己亲手建立起来的人民政权的血肉关系，更进一步地维护人民政府的法令，推行人民政府的政策，以巩固工人阶级领导的人民政权。并在工会领导下，积极生产，创造国家工业化的条件，为自己的长远利益而奋斗。
