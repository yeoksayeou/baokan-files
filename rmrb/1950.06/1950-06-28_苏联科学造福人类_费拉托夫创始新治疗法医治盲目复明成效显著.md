Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 18th (TASS dispatch): Soviet Academy of Sciences Academician and renowned ophthalmologist, Filatov, has achieved significant success in curing blindness and treating other diseases by applying his pioneering new treatment method – tissue therapy – in numerous treatments.

Academician Filatov is the director of the world's largest center for research and treatment of eye diseases – the Ukrainian Experimental Institute of Ophthalmology. He has completed surgeries involving the transplantation of corneal tissue, restoring vision to those blinded by cataracts or with reduced vision, and has designed new instruments. Over the past several years, he has performed over three thousand eye surgeries. His methods have been widely adopted in the medical community.

In experiments involving the cold storage of cadaver corneas, he has made significant comprehensive research contributions and has confirmed that every type of biochemical tissue from a living organism (human, animal, or plant), if separated from the organism and preserved under special conditions, will produce a therapeutically effective substance. Academician Filatov calls this substance "biogenic stimulator." For example, cold-storing cadaver skin and then suturing it onto the living organic tissue of a living person can have a strong impact, thereby curing various diseases.

Filatov's tissue therapy has proven to be an effective method in over five hundred treatments of various diseases. It has become a savior for curing serious eye diseases such as optic nerve atrophy and glaucoma, as well as various traumas, infectious diseases, and mental illnesses.

    费拉托夫创始新治疗法医治盲目复明成效显著
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：苏联科学院院士、著名眼科医生费拉托夫，应用他所创始的新治疗法——组织治疗法，来治疗眼病，使盲目复明以及治疗其他疾病，已在多次的治疗中获得显著成效。
    费拉托夫院士是全世界最大的研究与治疗眼病的中心——乌克兰实验眼科研究所的主持人。他完成了移植眼球角膜，使因眼翳失明或视力减退的人恢复视力的手术，并且设计了新的器具。在过去数年内，他已做过三千余次眼科手术。他的方法在医界已被广泛采用。
    在冷藏尸体角膜的实验方面，他作出了重大的综合研究，并且证实：每种有生物（人、动物或植物）的属于生物化学的组织，如果与有机体分离后，在特殊条件之下加以保藏，它就会产生一种对治疗有效的物质。费拉托夫院士把此种物质称之为“有机体续生刺激素”。例如把尸体的皮肤经过冷藏后缝合在活人的有机组织上，就能发生强烈的影响，从而治愈多种疾病。
    费拉托夫的组织治疗法，已在五百余次多种疾病的治疗中，证实为有效的方法。它已成为治愈视神经萎缩和绿内障等严重的眼疾以及各种外伤、传染病和精神病的救星。
