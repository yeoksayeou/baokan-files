Letter from the Beijing Fifteenth District Government
    Responding to Farmers' Criticism of Village Cadres

To the Editors:

    We read in the People's Garden on May 14th the criticism from a group of farmers in the Fifteenth Administrative Village (Dongguantou Administrative Village) of our district regarding the undemocratic work style of the village farmers' association cadres, along with four specific examples. On the same day, the district government and district committee studied the matter, and on the 15th, the deputy district head, the head of the Civil Affairs Section, and the deputy director of the Organization Department of the district committee went to the village to conduct an inspection together with the work team. The findings of the inspection are explained below:

    Li Wenhe, the director of the village farmers' association, is not good at leading the masses in his work. He has not promoted democracy and cannot effectively complete work through the organization, which has caused dissatisfaction among the masses in the village.

    After checking the incidents mentioned in the newspaper, we believe there are some discrepancies with the facts:

    1. Regarding the vehicle donation issue. This was not this year's vehicle donation but the vehicle donations for the first and second halves of 1949. The time for collecting the vehicle donation was on the night of November 20, 1949. It was handled by Li Wenhe and Wang Maolin at the Fengtai Tax Office. Each vehicle owner was notified in advance to pay the money to the village government. However, Huang Guihua, Chen Yongcai, Sun Weisheng, and Yang Wanfu failed to pay the vehicle donation on time and were therefore penalized by the tax office. This matter was already reviewed at a mass meeting during the land reform.

    2. Regarding the public grain issue. This problem was discovered during the clearing of advance public grain during the siege period last year. It had been raised during land reform, and it was also announced at a mass meeting that the finance and grain committee member Wang Xing should settle the accounts and publish a list to the masses. The people responsible for collecting grain at that time were Han Baocai (public security officer), Sun Ruilin (public security officer), Wang Xing (finance and grain committee member), and Li Wenhe (then the deputy director of the farmers' association). As for the surplus grain issue, further investigation is needed. We hope that the villagers will actively provide opinions so that it can be dealt with quickly.

    3. The house issue of Li, an old woman in Guantou Village. This person cannot be found in the village, and there was no incident of allocating two rooms and then taking back one. The allocation of houses during the land reform was all resolved by the masses themselves through discussion. Only Han Li was allocated two rooms, but due to a mistake during the allocation, he actually only received one. His wife went to the Civil Affairs Section of the district government once, and the district government introduced her to the work team for handling. The work team and village cadres gave him other houses, but he did not want them, saying the houses were too far away and not good. There were no houses nearby, so no other solution could be found. This has already been explained by the work team and village cadres.

    4. The issue of caring for military families. There are a total of twelve military families in the village, ten of whom have labor power and do not need substitute cultivation. Among the other two, one is Wang Shengkui (a landlord) who should solve it by hiring laborers himself. The other is Yang Dongshi who lives in the city and has three family members, relying on the rent of more than twenty rooms in the city for living expenses. She has 16.7 mu of land in the village, which should be confiscated because it is land occupied by a Japanese brick kiln. The land has already been dealt with, leaving her 10.7 mu for her own use, and the remaining six mu were allocated to others for cultivation. Her request for these six mu of land is unreasonable.

    We believe that the criticism from the farmers of the Fifteenth Administrative Village of the undemocratic work style of the village farmers' association cadres is correct. We express our sincere welcome and acceptance and should conduct a good review. We hope that the villagers will offer more opinions and criticisms in the future. On the other hand, it must be stated that no cadre of ours can retaliate against critics for being criticized. We hope that the critics will dispel their concerns and frankly point out the shortcomings in our work so that we can correct them and better serve the people.

    Beijing Municipal People's Government, Fifteenth District People's Government

    Editor's Note: The district government has investigated the issue of the Fifteenth Administrative Village of Fengtai. If there are still discrepancies with the facts, the villagers can continue to provide opinions. In addition, regarding the district government's handling of several issues, we have the following opinions: Regarding Han Li's house issue, if he still disagrees after the work team and village cadres have explained it to Han Li himself, it is still necessary to continue discussing with him to seek a reasonable solution. Regarding the issue of substitute cultivation for the military family of Wang Shengkui, although his family used to be landlords, it should be handled according to the new specific circumstances after the land reform.

### 北京十五区政府来信  答复农民对村干部的批评

　　北京十五区政府来信
    答复农民对村干部的批评编辑同志：
    我们看到人民园地五月十四日登载本区（十五区）十五行政村（东管头行政村）一群农民批评该村农会干部作风不民主，并举出四件事实。当天即经区政府和区委会研究，并于十五日由本区副区长、民政科长及区委会组织部副部长到该村协同工作组进行检查。兹将检查结果说明如下：
    该村农会主任李文和在工作中不善于领导群众，没有发扬民主，不能很好地通过组织来完成工作，引起村中群众不满。
    报上所举的几件事情，经检查后，我们认为与事实有些出入：
    一、关于上车捐事。那不是本年车捐而是一九四九年上半年和下半年的车捐。上车捐的时间是一九四九年十一月二十日夜间。是李文和及王茂林在丰台税务所办的。事先曾通知各车户往村政府交款。但黄贵华、陈永才、孙维生、杨万甫等四户未按期交到车捐，因此受到税务所的处罚。这事情在土地改革时已在群众大会上检讨过。
    二、关于公粮问题。此问题是去年清理围城时期垫支公粮时发现的。土地改革时曾有人反映过，也在群众大会上宣布过，要财粮委员王兴结算账目，向群众公布清单。当时负责收粮的人有韩保才（公安员）、孙瑞林（公安员）、王兴（财粮委员）、李文和（当时是农会副主任）四人。至于余粮问题，尚须继续调查。希该村农民积极提供意见，以便很快处理。
    三、管头村李老太太的房子问题。在该村找不到此人，也没有分了二间抽回一间的事情。土改时分房问题，都是群众自己商量解决的。只有韩礼分了二间房子，因分的时候弄错了，实际只拿到一间。他妻子找过区政府民政科一次，由区政府介绍给工作组处理。工作组和村干部另给他别的房子，他不要，说房子太远，又不好。近的地方无房子，这样就想不出别的办法。这已经工作组和村干部给解释过了。
    四、军属的照顾问题。该村军属共十二户，其中十户均有劳动力，不用代耕，其他二户中，有一户是王胜魁（地主）应由他自己雇工解决。一户是杨董氏在城内住，家里有三口人，依靠城内二十多间房租生活。在该村她有地十六亩七分，因系日本砖窑占地，应予没收。该地已经处理，留给她自己使用十亩七分，其余六亩调配给别人耕种。她要这六亩地，是不合理的。
    我们认为这次十五行政村农民对于该村农会干部不民主作风的批评，是正确的。我们表示诚恳的欢迎与接受，并应很好检讨。希望该村老百姓今后多提意见，多加批评。另一方面必须要说明的，我们任何干部都不能因被批评而对批评者进行报复。希望批评者去掉顾虑，直爽地指出我们工作的缺点，以便我们改正，更好地为人民服务。
    北京市人民政府第十五区人民政府
    编者按：关于丰台十五行政村的问题，已经区政府进行调查。如与事实还有出入，该村群众仍可继续提供意见。此外，关于区政府对几个问题的处理，我们有以下意见：韩礼的房子问题，经工作组及村干部对韩礼本人解释后，如他仍不同意，还需和他继续商量，以求得合理解决。关于军属王胜魁的代耕问题，虽然他家过去是地主，土地改革后应根据新的具体情况处理。
