To the Editor:

　　I am from Dali Village, Third District, Funing County, Hebei Province, and currently work in the Political Department of the Quartermaster Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region. Not only has my family not enjoyed preferential treatment as a military family member, but the land allocated to me during the land reform was also confiscated by the village cadres. Now my family does not have a single mu of land, making it impossible to maintain a living. I have returned home to request the county People's Government to resolve this issue, but they consistently fail to address it.

　　My village implemented land reform in 1947. At that time, each person was allocated 3.2 mu of land based on the total population and land area of the village. My family was a middle-peasant family with eight people and 34 mu of land. We were allocated 3.2 mu per person and handed over the excess land. During the final review, some floating assets were also taken away (without compensation afterward). At that time, bad elements in the village spread rumors saying: "We have to struggle more fiercely than before! No matter what 'peasant' you are, if you have anything, you have to hand it over!" As a result, more than a quarter of the families in the village were frightened and fled. My family also fled to Liushouying, 25 li away from the village (which had not yet been liberated at that time). Under the propaganda and mobilization of the People's Government, everyone gradually returned that year. However, after these people returned, part of the land they had originally been allocated had been confiscated; another part had been occupied or exchanged by the village cadres. Only some of the remaining land was distributed to them, one mu or less per person, and the quality was very poor. The village cadres said that this was what the district government had instructed (at that time, it was the Seventh District). The land of my family was divided by village cadres Wang Jinlong and others, leaving only four mu of riverbed wasteland, which was both remote and of poor quality. My family hoped to exchange it for some cultivable land, but the village cadres said: "There is no land left, take it or leave it!" Discussions with district cadres about this matter also yielded no results. Last October, my mother went to the county government to discuss this issue. The county only said: "Wait for an investigation before processing." But there has been no progress so far. The village cadres knew that my mother had appealed to the county about this matter and threatened her, saying: "Go ahead and sue us, it won't do any good!" My mother was very frightened. After that, no one dared to mention this matter again. My family's land problem has not been resolved for three years. My family should be treated as a military family, but the village cadres said that the higher authorities had not notified them. However, the county government said that the district had been notified last October.

　　After exchanging opinions with the village cadres, I reported the entire situation to the county People's Government. The responsible comrade of the county said: "Your family's land has already been cultivated by others, what can we do? The land certificates are about to be issued, it would be too troublesome to change things now." I went to consult the county committee again. The responsible comrade of the county committee also expressed the same opinion. They said that if it was really impossible to maintain a living, the government could give you some material relief. I believe that farmers without land are equal to losing the guarantee of life. Because relief is not a fundamental solution. I hope for a public response as to whether the handling of this problem by our county, district, and village governments is appropriate.

　　Editor's Note: Judging from the situation described in the letter, the land in Dali Village should be reasonably adjusted according to the actual situation, or appropriate compensation should be given. The responsible cadres of the county and district should not say that there is no way and fail to resolve it. We hope that the local government will properly handle it.

### 李易天家的土地问题抚宁县府应予适当解决

　　李易天家的土地问题抚宁县府应予适当解决编辑同志：
    我是河北抚宁县三区大李庄村人，现在华北军区后勤部军需部政治部工作。今我家不但未享有军属优待，在土地改革时分给我的土地也被村干没收了。现在家中没有一亩土地，致生活无法维持。我曾回家要求县人民政府予以解决，但他们总是不给处理。
    我村是在一九四七年实行土改的。当时按全村人口与地亩数量每人分得三亩二分地。而我家是中农，八口人，有三十四亩地，每人分得三亩二，把多余的地献出去了。在最后一次复查时还分去了一些浮产（以后也未补偿）。当时村中因有坏分子造谣说：“还得斗争，比早先还要斗得厉害！不管你什么‘农’，有一点东西就得拿出来！”结果使全村四分之一以上的人家吓得逃走了，我家也逃到离村二十五里的留守营（当时还未解放）。在人民政府的宣传和动员下，当年都陆续回来了。但这些人回来以后，他们原先分得的土地，一部分已经被没收了；另一部分则被村干部占去了或换掉了。只把剩下的一些地分给他们。每人一亩或不到一亩，质量上也很坏。村干部说这是区里叫这样做的（那时是七区）。我家的地被村干部王金龙等人分了，而仅剩四亩河洼荒地，又远又不好。家里希望能换一点能种的地。但村干部说：“地没有了，不要拉倒！”同区干部讨论这件事，亦无结果。去年十月我母亲曾到县府去谈这个问题。县里只说：“等调查调查再处理。”但至今毫无着落。村干部知道我母亲去县里申诉这件事，就威胁她说：“去上边告我们吧，啥也不顶事！”我母亲吓得什么似的。以后就没人敢再提这件事了。三年来我家的土地问题始终没解决。我家应按军属待遇，但村干说上级未通知。而县里则说去年十月就已通知区了。
    我和村干部交换了意见之后，就把全部情况反映到县人民政府。县负责同志说：“你家的地已经被别人种了，那有啥法呢？眼看就要发地照，动起来就太麻烦了。”我又去请示县委会。县委会负责同志也表示这样的意见。他们说如果实在无法维持生活的话，政府可给你点物质救济。我认为农民没有了土地，等于失去了生活的保障。因为救济不是根本解决问题的办法。我县、区、村政府对这问题的处理是否妥当，希望予以公开答复。

    编者按：照信上所说的情况看来，大李庄村的土地应该根据实际情况加以合理调剂，或给以适当的补偿。县区负责干部不应该说没有办法而不予以解决。望当地政府妥善加以处理。
