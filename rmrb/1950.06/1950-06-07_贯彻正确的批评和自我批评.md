　　Following the publication of the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Carrying Out Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" and the News Administration's "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work," Party committees and people's governments at all levels have made great efforts to implement these two decisions. Judging from what has already been read in the newspapers alone, there have been instructions from the Party committees or people's governments of Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhejiang, Liaoxi and other provinces and cities regarding the implementation of these decisions. Under the leadership of local Party committees and governments, criticism and self-criticism in major national newspapers has begun to strengthen. Newspapers are using considerable space to publish critical articles. Yangtze Daily, Hebei Daily, Shandong Dazhong Daily, New Hunan Daily, Zhejiang Daily, Suiyuan Daily, Yunnan Daily, Songjiang Daily, etc., have reorganized their supplements to publish mainly readers' critical and suggestive letters, or have renamed the entire supplement "Reader Letters," such as Hebei Daily. The expanded position of reader letters in newspapers also proves that the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism has enhanced readers' political enthusiasm. This newspaper received 1,674 reader letters in April, doubling the number in March, and increased to 2,478 in May. Other major newspapers in North China also generally doubled the number of reader letters received in May. Newspapers have initially overcome the tendency to "report good news but not bad news." This progress in newspaper work is worth cherishing.

　　Readers' opinions published in newspapers have begun to attract great attention. On May 21, Zhejiang Daily published three reader letters criticizing the shortcomings and problems in tea procurement work in various places. On the 22nd, it published an editorial criticizing this issue. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Commerce and the Hangzhou Branch of China Tea immediately conducted a thorough inspection based on the newspaper's criticism. The Provincial People's Government also immediately issued instructions based on the newspaper's criticism and the company's inspection, pointing out ways to correct deviations and improve tea procurement work, and published them in the newspaper on the 24th. On May 14, Southern Daily published a news story in a prominent position on the front page, exposing the Guangzhou Municipal Feces Management Office's staff's revelations of the head of the office, Yang Qinghua's corruption and serious bureaucratic style. Based on the newspaper's criticism, the city's Health Bureau dismissed Yang Qinghua and dealt with him according to law, and held an anti-corruption conference, while also handling four other corruption cases. The examples of Zhejiang Daily and Southern Daily also prove that newspapers' attention to readers' opinions can definitely help leading organs discover mistakes and improve work.

　　Our newspapers have already achieved results in unfolding criticism and self-criticism, which should be affirmed. However, there are also significant shortcomings in this area, mainly: the criticism in many newspapers has not been fully developed; there has not been enough attention to focusing and highlighting criticism on the most important current issues, and there is a phenomenon of being fragmented and afraid to let go. The reasons for this phenomenon are multifaceted, mainly that our newspaper workers have not made sufficient efforts to implement correct criticism and self-criticism.

　　Our newspaper workers and correspondents still have some incorrect understandings. They are afraid of offending people and afraid of "affecting work," and dare not carry out criticism. On May 20, Sub North Daily published an inspection of criticism and self-criticism in reports from the Jingfu, Qidong, and Haimen communication stations, which revealed this phenomenon; in their work, due to the erroneous idea of "fearing that criticism of the district's work would affect our communication work," the "criticism only remained on rural work, and criticism of work above the district level was very insufficient."

　　Some newspaper workers and correspondents also lack a serious and responsible attitude towards criticism and self-criticism, and dare not take full responsibility for critical articles themselves. In the above-mentioned review of the Haimen communication station of Sub North Daily, it was mentioned that they sometimes "after consulting the relevant departments, if they did not agree to publish, they would relax and fail to adhere to the truth." This has caused our newspapers to abandon many of the critical responsibilities that they should fulfill.

　　At the same time, some staff members also lack the style of facing up to shortcomings, checking errors, and improving work based on criticism, and therefore adopt an attitude of suppressing, resisting, or even retaliating against newspaper criticism. The Zhou Fugeng incident in Wuxi is an extremely serious example.

　　On May 11, Sub South Daily published an article by the Fourth Communication Group of Lixin Yarn Factory criticizing "the union and the masses are not communicating." Zhou Fugeng, director of the preparatory committee of the Lixin Union, did not review his work based on the criticism, but instead beat up the worker Huang Jiduo who wrote the article, and even said: "I would rather not have party membership and not be the director of the union, I just want to beat people." After this incident occurred, because the Wuxi Cotton Textile Industry Union and the Wuxi Municipal General Branch of the Communist Party of China did not give it enough attention at the time, it caused a very bad reaction among the workers; newspaper correspondents, seeing that freedom of speech was not guaranteed, returned their letters of appointment one after another, the head of the communication group proposed to resign, and a few members of the Youth League proposed to withdraw from the League. On May 14, Sub South Daily published a detailed account of the incident and a commentary on the incident. The leading organs of the Wuxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Wuxi Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the People's Court made a solemn handling based on the newspaper's criticism, expelling Zhou Fugeng from the party, dismissing him from the post of director of the union preparatory committee, and sentencing him to 15 days of detention in the judiciary. It was published in the newspaper on May 26 to educate its cadres.

　　It should be pointed out that situations similar to the Zhou Fugeng incident are very likely to be encountered in our unfolding of criticism and self-criticism. Sub South Daily implemented correct criticism and self-criticism and reasonably resolved this problem, which is very good. However, there are still many problems of the same nature in various places that have not been dealt with in a timely and correct manner. A worker in a public factory in Tianjin wrote an article criticizing the factory in the newspaper, and as a result was fired. The newspaper did not report this improper retaliatory behavior and demand a reasonable solution.

　　What do these phenomena illustrate? This shows that our newspaper workers still have some incorrect ideas, and sometimes adopt a liberal attitude towards criticism and self-criticism, emphasizing "prudence" and actually canceling criticism. This shows that because some cadres and even leading organs still lack a correct understanding of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, newspapers are prone to encountering difficulties when conducting criticism. And when encountering difficulties, our newspaper workers do not always have enough awareness, adhere to the truth, implement criticism, solve problems, and educate readers, and sometimes still adopt a liberal compromise attitude. The factor hindering the further development of criticism and self-criticism lies here.

　　Abandoning and suppressing criticism will inevitably lead to serious consequences. Such an educational event occurred in Songjiang Province: Yu Xiuhua of the Songjiang Provincial Department of Industry wrote an article criticizing the Hulan Match Factory for not paying enough attention to fire prevention. Deng, the section chief of the Industrial and Mining Section of the department, refused to publish it on the grounds that he was "afraid of affecting the mood of the workers." As a result, a fire in the Hulan Match Factory caused a major loss of 3 billion yuan. After the fire incident occurred in the factory, Songjiang Daily published news on May 13 criticizing the bureaucracy of the factory leadership, but did not publish this example of suppressing criticism and producing bad results, which is regrettable. This realistic lesson should alert us that only by newspapers fulfilling their responsibility to persist in criticism and correct mistakes can they avoid major losses to the people's country like the Hulan Match Factory incident.

　　The facts of more than a month show that criticism and self-criticism in newspapers still needs to be further developed. To this end, our newspaper workers should resolutely do the following three points:

　　First, we must have the courage to fight stubbornly against shortcomings and mistakes, and oppose the liberal attitude of abandoning criticism and self-criticism for this or that consideration.

　　Second, we must establish a serious spirit of guaranteeing the authenticity of critical articles and being responsible for ourselves, and oppose the mentality of dependence and compromise on the review of articles by relevant organs or parties concerned.

　　Third, we must carry out necessary struggles against the suppression, resistance, and even retaliation against criticisms published in newspapers by certain personnel of certain organs, and use concrete facts to educate them and overcome this bad style.

　　For newspaper workers, this is the key to implementing correct criticism and self-criticism.

### 贯彻正确的批评和自我批评

　　贯彻正确的批评和自我批评
    在中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上开展批评和自我批评的决定”和新闻总署“关于改进报纸工作的决定”发表以后，各级党委和人民政府对于执行这两个决定都作了很大的努力。仅从报纸上读到的便已经有上海、南京、浙江、辽西等省市的党委会或人民政府关于贯彻这些决定的指示。在各地党委的和政府的领导下，全国重要报纸的批评和自我批评已经开始加强了。报纸用很大的篇幅来登载批评性的稿件。长江日报、河北日报、山东大众日报、新湖南报、浙江日报、绥远日报、云南日报、松江日报等已改组了他们的副刊，以主要篇幅刊载读者的批评和建议的来信，或把副刊整个改称“读者来信”，如河北日报。读者来信在报纸上所占地位的扩大，也证明批评和自我批评的展开业已提高了读者的政治积极性。本报四月份收到读者来信一千六百七十四件，较三月份增加一倍，而五月份则增加到二千四百七十八件。其他华北各地主要报纸在五月份收到的读者来信也一般地增加了一倍。报纸初步克服了“报喜不报忧”的倾向。报纸工作中的这种进步是值得珍视的。
    读者在报纸上发表的意见开始引起了很大的重视。五月二十一日浙江日报发表了三封读者来信，批评各地收购茶叶工作中的缺点和问题，二十二日发表了批评这一问题的社论，浙江省商业厅和中茶杭州分公司立即根据报纸的批评作了深入的检查，省人民政府也立即根据报纸的批评和公司方面的检查发布指示，指出纠正偏向改进收茶工作的办法，同时在二十四日的报纸上公布。五月十四日南方日报以第一版重要地位，发表广州市粪溺管理处职工揭发该处负责人杨庆华贪污腐化和严重官僚主义作风的新闻，该市卫生局根据报纸的批评，将杨庆华撤职法办，并举行反贪污大会，同时处理了另外四件贪污案。浙江日报和南方日报的例子也证明，报纸重视读者意见就一定可以帮助领导机关发现错误、改进工作。
    我们的报纸在展开批评和自我批评上已经有了成绩，这是应该肯定的。但是在这一方面也还有很大的缺点，主要的是：许多报纸的批评还没有充分展开；还没有注意更经常地针对当前最重要问题作集中的突出的批评，有零碎琐细而又不敢放手的现象。造成这种现象的原因是多方面的，主要的是我们的报纸工作者对于贯彻正确的批评和自我批评的努力不足。
    我们的报纸工作者和通讯员还有一些不正确的认识，他们因为怕得罪人，怕“影响工作”，不敢进行批评。五月二十日苏北日报发表了靖府、启东、海门三个通讯站关于报道中的批评和自我批评的检查，就发现了这种现象；在他们的工作中因存在着“怕批评了区里的工作而影响了我们的通讯工作”的错误思想，已经使得稿件中的“批评仅仅停留在乡村工作上，而对区以上工作的批评就非常不够”。
    也有的报纸工作者和通讯员还缺少对批评和自我批评的认真负责的态度，不敢对批评的稿件自己担负完全的责任。上引苏北日报海门通讯站的检讨中，就说到他们有时“在征询有关部门后，他们不同意发表，也就放松了，未能坚持真理”。这就使我们的报纸放弃了许多应尽的批评的职责。
    同时，有些工作人员还缺少正视缺点，根据批评检查错误、改进工作的作风，因此对报纸的批评采取了压制、抗拒、甚至报复的态度。无锡周福赓事件是一个极严重的例子。
    五月十一日苏南日报发表了丽新纱厂第四通讯小组批评“工会与群众两不通气”的稿子，丽新工会筹委会主任周福赓不是根据批评来检讨自己的工作，反而把写稿的工人黄纪舵打了一顿，甚至说：“我宁可不要党籍，不当工会主任，我就是要打人。”这一事件发生后，由于无锡棉纺业产业工会和中共无锡市棉纺业总支当时没有予以足够的重视，在工人中引起了极坏的反响；报纸通讯员眼见言论自由没有保障，纷纷退还聘书，通讯组总组长提出要辞职，少数青年团员提出要退团。五月十四日苏南日报详细地发表了这一事件的经过和关于这一事件的评论，中共无锡市委、无锡市总工会、人民法院等领导机关，即根据报纸的批评作了严正的处理，开除了周福赓的党籍、撤消工会筹委会主任的职务，司法上判处拘役十五天。并于五月二十六日在报纸上公布，用以教育自己的干部。
    应该指出，类似周福赓事件的情形是我们在展开批评和自我批评中很可能遇到的。苏南日报贯彻了正确的批评和自我批评，合理地解决了这个问题，这是很好的。但是，各地还有不少同样性质的问题没有及时而正确地加以处理。天津一个公营工厂的工人写稿在报纸上批评了厂方，结果竟被开除了。对于这种不正当的报复行为，报纸上就没有加以报道，要求合理的解决。
    这些现象说明了什么呢？这就说明：我们的报纸工作者还有一些不正确的思想，对于批评和自我批评有时采取了自由主义的态度，强调了“慎重”而实际上取消了批评。这就说明：由于某些干部甚至领导机关对于布尔什维克的批评和自我批评还缺少正确的认识，使得报纸在进行批评时很容易遭遇到困难。而在遇到困难的时候，我们的报纸工作者也并不是经常有足够的认识，坚持真理，贯彻批评，解决问题，教育读者，有时还是采取了自由主义的妥协态度。阻碍进一步展开批评和自我批评的因素就在这里。
    放弃和压制批评必然引起严重的后果。松江省就发生过这样一桩富有教育意义的事件：松江省工业厅于秀华写稿批评呼兰火柴厂没有充分注意防火，该厅工矿科邓科长借口“怕影响工人情绪”而拒绝发表，结果呼兰火柴厂一次失火就造成了三十亿的重大损失。在该厂失火事件发生之后，松江日报五月十三日发表了新闻，批评工厂领导上的官僚主义，但是没有把这个压制批评产生恶果的实例发表出来，这是可以引为遗憾的。这种现实的教训应当使我们警惕，只有报纸善尽坚持批评、纠正错误的责任，才能避免像呼兰火柴厂事件那样的对人民国家的重大的损失。
    一个多月以来的事实说明，报纸上的批评和自我批评还有待于更进一步展开。为此，我们的报纸工作者应该坚决做到以下三点：
    第一、要有与缺点和错误作顽强斗争的勇敢的精神，反对为了这种或那种顾虑而放弃了批评和自我批评的自由主义态度。
    第二、要建立对批评稿件保证真实性和自己负责的认真的精神，反对对有关机关或当事人的审稿存在依赖心理和妥协心理。
    第三、要对于某些机关的某些人员对报纸上发表的批评所作的压制、抗拒、甚至报复行为进行必要的斗争，用具体的事实教育他们，克服这种恶劣的作风。
    对于报纸工作者来说，这是贯彻正确的批评和自我批评的关键。
