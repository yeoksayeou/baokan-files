　　Regarding Railway Protection Work
　　Fengtai Public Security Section Responds to Reader's Suggestion

Editor:

    In the People's Daily "People's Garden" on May 28th, Comrade Li Bosheng, a researcher from the Anci County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province, made a suggestion that women and children often use small knives and small picks to chop sleepers on the railway between Langfang and Wanzhuang on the Beijing-Tianjin line, and he hoped that the Wanzhuang Public Security Station would stop it. After our investigation, we learned that the Wanzhuang Public Security Station did not pay enough attention to the line patrol work, especially the railway protection work was very poor, which led to the above-mentioned situation. Now we have sent cadres to the station to convene a meeting of staff to conduct a review and study how to carry out mass railway protection work to prevent the recurrence of the above. We express our gratitude to Comrade Li Bosheng for his care for the people's railway.

　　关于护路工作
    丰台公安段答读者建议编辑同志：
    五月二十八日人民日报人民园地发表了中共河北省安次县委会研究员李勃升同志的一个建议，说京津路廊房至万庄段常有妇女小孩在铁路上用小刀小镐劈道木，希望万庄公安派出所制止。经我们调查了解，万庄公安派出所对巡线工作重视不够，尤其是护路工作做得很差，以致发生上述事情。现在我们已派干部到该所召集工作人员开会进行检讨，并研究如何开展群众性的护路工作，防止再度发生以上的事情。对李勃升同志爱护人民铁路的精神，我们表示感谢。
