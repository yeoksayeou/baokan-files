A Record of the Exhibition and Symposium in Moscow on Opposing Wars of Aggression and Defending World Peace
    Hua Junwu

　　In a building facing the street on the bustling Kuznetsky Most Street in Moscow, an exhibition of political cartoons and posters is being held, called "Exhibition of Paintings Against War and Defending World Peace." The exhibition hall consists of four rooms, full of paintings, with political cartoons predominating. More than fifty writers participated in the works, all of whom are well-known and excellent cartoonists and poster artists in the Soviet Union (but not all of them). Many painters whom we have long admired exhibited their original works here, including Kukryniksy, Yefimov, Ganf, Gorlov, Ivanov, and Prorokov. Some are painted with color, some with ink, and some with black and white lines. The themes of the paintings are also diverse, some depicting the sharp contrast between socialist countries and capitalist countries; some depicting the lives of people within capitalist countries; some reflecting the victory of the people of the world; some reflecting the perverse acts of imperialists and warmongers, as well as their decline and crisis; some depicting the internal contradictions of the reactionary class; and some depicting the hard life under the Marshall Plan in Western Europe. In these paintings, we see the victory of the people, and also the warmongers Truman, Churchill, Acheson, Marshall, and the bosses of Wall Street, and their lackeys Bevin, Montgomery, De Gaulle, Schuman, the traitor Tito, and the Chinese war criminal Chiang Kai-shek. In the painters' pens, they were stripped of their formal attire and disarmed; their pretentious and intimidating heroic posture disappeared, and only the images of panic and ugly appearance were vividly presented to the audience. Soviet soldiers reflected on the cartoonists: cartoonists and our soldiers are fighting together, but they are using a different kind of weapon. A Soviet soldier put it even better, saying, "Soviet cartoonists are first-rate shooters, they are not hitting the enemy's eyebrows, but the enemy's eyes." In these works, we see all the painters using angry eyes, concentrating their firepower on the enemy's vital points from various angles. Many paintings have their own unique style, without imitation (there is only one, but it has also been criticized), each with its own unique and vivid style. Soviet art critic Chekhodayev said: "The goal of Soviet political cartoons is the same, but everyone has their own characteristics. Only socialist realism can give play to everyone's talent and creativity, while the characteristic of formalism is cliché and lack of creativity."

　　These political cartoons are closely integrated with the real political struggle, and each painting uses extremely simple metaphors, but correctly expresses the essence of things. This is the combination of politics and observation of life. For example, Kukryniksy painted Chiang Kai-shek's head, placed diagonally in a garbage can, but he was entertaining American reporters sitting on chairs, spouting rhetoric. Truman was giving a haircut to a lion (symbolizing the British Empire), with a piece of cloth around it with the words "Washington Financial Negotiations" written on it, and all the hair around him was shaved off and none was left. Many paintings depict the problems of China and the Far East. For example, Yefimov has a painting depicting MacArthur inspecting his Japanese germ warfare unit, with Japanese warlords holding many tubes like command knives, filled with germs; Kukryniksy painted the dying Chiang Kai-shek crawling on the sickbed, while the Americans were still sticking plasters of gold yuan (see Illustration 1). Chiang Kai-shek's "presidency" was actually just a puppet pieced together by Acheson (see Illustration 2).

　　Prorokov, the painter who is currently ill, painted more than ten bleak pictures of the American people and American blacks, such as the painting of a black man being beaten, titled "Lynching"; a painting of children picking up things in the trash to fill their hunger, titled "Children of the Metropolis." Another painter, Litvinenko, painted a wife who was homeless and dozing beside her husband holding a child across the street from the brightly lit American skyscraper, titled "No Room to Live."

　　A smaller number, but also extremely eye-catching, are the posters. Some of them use positive descriptions, such as Ivanov's painting of Soviet mothers and children, titled "Mothers of the World, Fight for Peace!" Painting the Chinese and Soviet people standing together, titled "Long Live the Friendship between the Chinese and Soviet People!" Painting Mayakovsky, and writing his famous anti-war quote. There is also a method of organizing positive and negative characters on the same screen (in cooperation with cartoons). There is a meaningful painting here. A Soviet soldier is warning the warmongers and imperialists who are playing with fire with his left hand, and his right hand is holding up a book, the title of which is "The Heroic History of the Soviet Army" (see Illustration 3). There is also a method of contrast, with one side of the painting showing the Soviet Union carrying out construction, and the other side showing the United States preparing for war. Another example is that on one side, all the nationalities of the Soviet Union are marching in unity, and on the other side, an American black man is tied to a pillar, with blood dripping from his head and dying. Many viewers praised these cartoons and posters, affectionately calling them good. This is not only because Soviet painters have a high degree of political literacy and sensitivity, but also because they have extremely high technical training, and political and artistic qualities are perfectly combined here. In the symposium to be discussed later, Zaslavsky, a commentator for Pravda, said: "The work of an artist, no matter how good its content and theme are, will not work if it is not well painted." From this, I also think of our criticism of the so-called "technical viewpoint," which refers to artists who do not ask about politics, do not talk about ideas, and simply pursue and emphasize technology. But this does not mean that we should ignore technology. On the one hand, we must constantly study politics and policies, and on the other hand, we must work hard to learn technology and train ourselves. Art critic Yoffe told me: "Look! Kukryniksy and many painters carry a small notebook and pencil with them." After saying this, he pretended to draw in a small notebook.

　　At 6:00 p.m. on May 23rd, the day the exhibition ended, political cartoonists and poster artists held a symposium with about a hundred people to discuss the works of the exhibition. What moved me most about this symposium was their spirit of criticism and self-criticism. At the meeting, they praised and analyzed good works, and also criticized the shortcomings in their work. They are proud that Soviet political cartoons are the best political cartoons in the world, and they are also proud that three cartoonists (actually five, because the name Kukryniksy contains three painters, this is the common name of the three painters' collective creation) won the Stalin Prize in 1949. In Democratic Germany, a new vocabulary has been created to call "cooperation," which is called "Kukryniksy." These glories are really exciting. But they did not stop at these satisfactions and prides. They criticized their own shortcomings, saying that there were not enough works on the theme of defending peace; the national liberation struggles in the colonies were rarely reflected; the works of ideological struggle against bourgeois intellectuals were not enough; Comrade Malenkov's report on the competition between socialism and capitalism was not well represented in the paintings; more posters should be created, because there are too few compared to political cartoons. The cultivation of new writers was also repeatedly mentioned at this meeting. Although they now have many excellent young new writers, it is not enough. Comrade Zaslavsky said: "What has been done has been done, but we should do more." Poet Marshak also said that the work should be improved year by year. Comrade Yefimov said on behalf of the painters at the end of the meeting: "We must not be complacent, and we must not only listen to others' praise, otherwise we will stop moving forward. When others praise, we should think about whether it is worth praising, whether it is 100% correct. We ourselves should also use the weapon of self-criticism to criticize ourselves." In this symposium, I personally experienced that one of the most important reasons why Soviet art can continue to move forward and produce more and better works year by year is their lack of complacency and their criticism and self-criticism full of love and kindness.

　　记莫斯科的反对侵略战争保卫世界和平画展和讨论会
    华君武
    在莫斯科热闹的库兹涅司基莫斯街的一幢临街的房子里，在举行着一个政治讽刺画和招贴画的展览会，这个展览会就叫“反对战争保卫世界和平的画展”。展览会场共有四个房间，满挂着画，其中政治讽刺画占大多数。参加作品的作家共五十余人，都是全苏联著名的优秀的讽刺画家和招贴画家（尚非全部）。许多为我们久所景慕的画家都以他们的原稿在此展览，其中有库克列尼克塞、叶菲莫夫、干夫、果洛、依凡诺夫、泼罗罗果夫等人的作品。有的是涂上彩色的，有的用水墨，有的用着黑白的单线。而画的题材也是多方面的，有的描写社会主义国家和资本主义国家的强烈对比；有的描写着资本主义国家内部的人民生活；有的反映着世界人民的胜利；有的反映着帝国主义和战争贩子的倒行逆施，以及他们的没落和危机；有的是描绘了反动阶级的内部矛盾；而有的却描画了西欧马歇尔计划下的困苦生活。在这些画里看到人民的胜利，也看到战争贩子杜鲁门、邱吉尔、艾奇逊、马歇尔和华尔街的老板们，和他们的奴才贝文、蒙哥马利、戴高乐、舒曼、叛徒铁托以及中国的战犯蒋介石。在画家们的笔下，他们被脱掉了大礼服，缴掉了武器；他们那些装腔作势，吓人的雄姿不见了，只有着惊惶失措，丑态毕露的形象活现在观众面前。苏联士兵对讽刺画家的反映是：讽刺画家和我们士兵是在共同战斗着的，只不过他们用的是另外一种武器。一位苏军战士更说得好，他说：“苏联的讽刺画家是头等射手，他们打着的，不是敌人的眉毛，而是敌人的眼睛。”在这些作品中，我们看到所有的画家用着愤怒的眼光，在各个角度中，集中火力向着敌人要害射击。许多画的风格是各有一套的，没有摹仿（只有一个，但也受到了批评），各有其特殊和生动的作风。苏联的艺术批评家契珂达雅夫说：“苏联的政治讽刺画的目的是共同的，但每人有自己的特色。只有社会主义现实主义才能够发挥各人的天才和创造性，而形式主义的特点就是老一套，没有创造性。”
    这些政治讽刺画都是和现实的政治斗争紧密结合着的，每一张画用着极简单的譬喻，但却正确表现了事物的本质。这是政治和对生活的观察的结合。例如库克列尼克塞画着蒋介石的头，斜放在一只盛垃圾的桶里，却在招待坐在椅子上的美国记者，大放厥词。杜鲁门在替狮子（象征英帝国）理发，围着一块布，上写华盛顿财政谈判，而周身的毛也都被刮去而一根不剩了。好多幅画表现着中国和远东的问题，例如叶菲莫夫有一幅画画着麦克阿瑟在检阅他的日本细菌部队，日本军阀举着许多像指挥刀样的管子，里边装的都是细菌；库克列尼克塞画着垂死的蒋介石爬在病床上，而美国人还在贴金元的膏药（见插图一）。蒋介石“总统”复职，实际上不过是艾奇逊拼凑起来的一个木偶而已（见插图二）。
    泼罗罗科夫，这位虽正抱病的画家，却画了十余幅美国人民和美洲黑人阴惨的图画，如围殴黑人一画，标题为《私刑》；在垃圾桶里捡东西充饥的儿童一画，标题为《大都市的孩子们》。另一位画家李特维宁科画着在灯光通明的美国摩天楼的对街，无家可归而瞌睡的妻子依在抱着孩子的丈夫身旁，标题为《无房可住》。
    数量较少，但亦极为引人注目的是招贴画。有的却用着正面的描写方法，如依凡诺夫画着苏联的母亲和孩子，标题为《全世界的母亲们为和平而斗争吧！》画着站在一起的中苏人民，标题为《中苏两国人民友谊万岁！》画着玛雅珂夫斯基，而写着他反对战争的名言。也有一种是采取正面人物和反派人物组织在同一画面上的方法（和讽刺画的合作）。这里有着一幅意味深长的画，一位苏联军人左手在警告着玩火的战争贩子，帝国主义者，他的右手举起一本书，书名即为《苏军的英勇历史》（见插图三）。也有一种是用对比的方法，画幅的一边是苏联在进行建设，而另一边则是美国在准备战争。又如一边是苏联各民族团结行进，而另一边则是一个被绑在柱上，头上流着鲜血的垂死的美洲黑人。许多观众在这些讽刺画和招贴画前，啧啧的赞赏着，亲热的在叫着好。这不只是因为苏联的画家在政治上有着高度修养和敏感，也是因为在技术上有着极高的锻炼，政治性和艺术性在这里完美的结合着。在后文要讲到的讨论会中，真理报的政论家萨斯拉夫斯基就说：“艺术家的作品不论他的内容和题材怎样好，画得不好，还是不起作用。”由此我也想到我们批评的所谓“技术观点”，是指艺术家不问政治，不讲思想，单纯地追求和强调技术。但这不是说，我们应该不管技术。一方面我们要经常学习政治和政策，一方面又要努力学习技术下苦功锻炼。艺术批评家约非告诉我说：“你看！库克列尼克塞以及许多画家，他们都是随身带着一个小本子和铅笔的。”说完这句话，他就装着在一个小本子上画画的样子。
    五月二十三日下午六时，展览会结束的那天，政治讽刺画家和招贴画家开了一个有百人模样的讨论会，讨论展览会的作品，这个讨论会使我最感动的，就是他们的批评和自我批评精神。在会议上他们赞扬和分析好的作品，同时也批评他们工作中的缺点。他们以苏联的政治讽刺画是世界上最好的政治讽刺画而自豪，他们也以一九四九年就有三个讽刺画家（实际是五人，因为其中库克列尼克塞的名字包含三个画家，这是三个画家集体创作的共同的名字）得了斯大林奖金而自豪。在民主德国已经创造出一种新的语汇来称呼“合作”，就叫做“库克列尼克塞”。这些光荣实在是令人兴奋的。但他们没有停留在这些满意和自豪中。他们批评自己的缺点说，以保卫和平为主题的作品还不够多；各殖民地的民族解放斗争还很少反映；向资产阶级的知识分子进行思想斗争的作品也还不够；马林科夫同志在报告中所说的社会主义和资本主义的竞赛，在画里还表现得不够；还应多多创作招贴画，因为比起政治讽刺画来就太少了。培养新作家也在这会上一再被提起，虽然他们现在已经有不少优秀的年轻的新作家，但还不够。萨斯拉夫斯基同志说：“做的已经做了，但我们还应做得更多。”诗人玛尔夏也说，工作应当一年比一年更改善。叶菲莫夫同志在会议最后代表画家发言说：“我们不要自满，不要只听别人的赞扬，这样我们就会停止不前。当别人赞扬时，应当想到是否值得赞扬，是否百分之百是对的。我们自己也应当用自我批评的武器来批评自己。”在这个讨论会中，我亲自体验到苏联艺术所以能够不断前进，一年比一年产生更多更好的作品，其最重要原因之一，便是他们的不自满，和充满着友爱和善意的批评和自我批评。（附图片）
