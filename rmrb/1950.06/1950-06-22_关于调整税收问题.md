On the Issue of Tax Adjustment
(Report at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, June 15, 1950)
Bo Yibo

Fellow Committee Members, Comrades!

Over the past eight months, the People's Government has done some work in ensuring the national revenue and expenditure budget for 1950 in terms of fiscal and taxation work. As of the end of May this year, customs duties have completed 33.45 percent of the annual target, salt tax 25 percent, and industrial and commercial tax, goods tax, and local tax combined have completed 35.45 percent. Autumn grain collection has reached 97 percent. The completion of these figures, coupled with the sale of nearly 90 million shares of the first phase of public bonds, has brought about a great change in the country's financial situation. The role of urban tax revenue has increased, reaching the same level as rural grain income. A planned tax system has begun to replace the method of issuing large amounts of banknotes, which had been forcibly adopted and was difficult to control, thereby placing the country's finances on a more solid foundation. After March this year, a situation of near-balance of revenue and expenditure and stable prices emerged. The achievement of these results should be attributed to the support of the people throughout the country and the efforts of the vast number of staff members.

We have many shortcomings and mistakes in our tax work. As Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "Not all of our hospital's doctors and assistants are highly skilled, and the preparation of various equipment and medicines is not complete, which has made some pain and difficulties that could have been avoided, unavoidable." For example, when we announced the two main tax laws, the industrial and commercial tax and the goods tax, we failed to announce the implementation rules at the same time, resulting in extremely inconsistent interpretations and applications of the tax law articles by local tax bureaus. Tax revenue targets were estimated based on tax rates, which is indispensable in fiscal work, but in practice, there have been phenomena of contradictions between targets and tax rates. In terms of tax types, tax items, and management procedures, some could have been simplified to reduce the difficulties of goods turnover and tax payment for industrial and commercial operators, but this was not done in a timely manner. The industrial and commercial tax, including business tax and income tax, based on the self-declaration and public deliberation of tax rates, is a relatively reasonable and necessary method when the conditions for tax levy based on rates are not yet available, but in the assessment process, many areas have experienced the phenomenon of small businesses squeezing out large businesses, and large businesses squeezing out small businesses, resulting in unfair burdens. Tax cadres work actively and are responsible for completing the tasks assigned by the state, which is good, but their style is sometimes relatively rigid, causing resentment among many taxpayers. In addition, more than 90 percent of the tax cadres are retained personnel, most of whom are good and work hard, but some still inherit the style of the Kuomintang era and engage in corruption and bribery. The reasons are mainly due to insufficient experience and insufficient education. As long as our financial and economic authorities pay attention to these issues, can analyze the situation, summarize experiences, stipulate correct tax rules, tax rates, and collection methods in a timely manner, and educate all cadres, the past shortcomings and mistakes can be corrected and the people's expectations can be met.

In order to adjust the relationship between public and private sectors from the perspective of taxation, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, a conference of tax bureau chiefs from major administrative regions, provinces, and major and medium-sized cities, including representatives of industrial and commercial operators, was convened. Based on the provisions of Section 2 of Article 40 of the Common Program: "The state's taxation policy should be based on the principle of ensuring the supply of the revolutionary war, taking into account the restoration and development of production, and the needs of national construction, simplifying the tax system, and implementing reasonable burdens," the following adjustments have been made to the tax issue:

Regarding tax types, tax items, and tax rates:

I. Tax Types: The "Essentials of National Tax Administration Implementation" promulgated on January 27 this year listed a total of fourteen types, namely, goods tax, industrial and commercial tax, salt tax, customs duties, salary and remuneration income tax, deposit interest income tax, stamp tax, inheritance tax, transaction tax, slaughter tax, real estate tax, land tax, special consumption behavior tax, and vehicle license tax. It has been decided that the salary and remuneration income tax and inheritance tax will not be levied for the time being, and the land tax and real estate tax will be merged into one, thus reducing the originally planned fourteen types to eleven.

II. Tax Items: The following amendments have been made to the goods tax and stamp tax:

(1) Goods Tax Items: Those completely exempt from tax include pottery, lime, earthen bricks and tiles, fountain pen parts, clock and watch parts, gramophone parts, automobiles and automobile parts, crude saltpeter, and candles, etc.; those partially exempt include rubber products, glass products, hardware, electrical materials, bicycle parts, mineral products, leather, and vegetable oils, etc. A total of 387 items are exempt. Those merged for collection include cotton fabrics merged with cotton yarn, woolen fabrics merged with woolen yarn, and paper items also merged, etc. In this way, another 391 items have been reduced. The two items together reduce 778 items. The original number of items was 1,136, and after the reduction and merger, 358 items remain.

(2) Stamp Tax: Some areas used the Kuomintang-era stamp tax law, with a total of 36 items. Others used the draft stamp tax regulations of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, with a total of 30 items. Based on the draft of the Ministry of Finance, the tax conference reduced items such as employee salary receipts, identity or qualification certificates, various permits and licenses, transportation passports, marriage certificates, employment certificates, reconciliation journals between headquarters and branches, monthly statements, reconciliation summaries, laundry and dyeing receipts, and savings account interest receipts below the threshold. A total of five items were reduced, leaving 25 items.

III. Tax Rates:

(1) Business tax: The portion taxed on the total business revenue will still maintain a tax rate of 1 percent to 3 percent; the portion taxed on the total business profit will still maintain a tax rate of 1.5 percent to 6 percent; and a portion taxed on commission based on business profit will be designated, with a tax rate of 10 percent to 20 percent.

(2) Income tax: The tax rate will remain at 5 percent to 30 percent, but the starting point for taxation will be raised from 1 million yuan to 3 million yuan, and a tax rate of 5 percent will apply. The highest progressive point will be raised from 30 million yuan to 100 million yuan, and a tax rate of 30 percent will apply. The number of progressive levels will be increased from 14 to 20, and the progression will be slowed down.

(3) Temporary commercial tax: The original progressive levy of 4 percent to 6 percent will be changed to a uniform levy at a rate of 5 percent.

(4) In the goods tax, the cigarette tax rate will be reduced from the original 120 percent ad valorem tax to 90 percent to 120 percent, with four levels of ad valorem taxation. The liquor tax rate will be changed from the original 120 percent to 50 percent. Denatured alcohol will be reduced from the original 120 percent to 30 percent. The combined levy of cotton yarn and cotton fabrics, which should have been 16.4 percent according to the original tax rate, will be reduced to 15 percent. The combined levy of woolen yarn and woolen fabrics, which should have been 30 percent according to the original tax rate, will be reduced to 20 percent. Matches will be reduced from the original 20 percent to 15 percent.

(5) Stamp tax: The scope of collection based on the amount of money will be reduced, and the scope of affixing stamps on a per-item basis will be expanded. For example, for commercial vouchers, except for invoices, which will still be affixed with stamps at a rate of 3 per thousand, sales receipts and other items will be changed to affixing stamps on a per-item basis.

(6) Interest income tax: Originally, only private banks and businesses were taxed at 10 percent of the income, and state-owned banks were not taxed. It has now been decided that all public and private banks will be taxed, and the tax rate will be reduced from 10 percent to 5 percent.

(7) Transaction tax: The scope of collection will be determined, and it will only be collected in places with brokers' markets. Public-owned stores, cooperatives, fixed industrial and commercial businesses, and those who do not transact through brokers and traders will not be subject to the transaction tax.

(8) The real estate tax and land tax items will be merged and levied separately. The original real estate tax was levied ad valorem at a rate of 1 percent to 1.5 percent, and the land tax was levied progressively at a rate of 1.5 percent to 4 percent. It is now set that the real estate tax will be levied at a uniform rate of 1 percent, and the land tax will be levied at a uniform rate of 1.5 percent. Public housing occupied by state organs, troops, and organizations will not be taxed.

(9) Special consumption behavior tax: The starting point for the banquet tax will be raised from 10,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan, the cold food tax will be raised from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, and it is stipulated that the hotel industry will only be taxed for rooms priced at 30,000 yuan or more per day.

(10) Slaughter tax: Guangdong will continue to levy the slaughter tax on animals slaughtered from other places. Livestock raised, slaughtered, and consumed by the people, government organs, troops, and organizations will not be subject to the slaughter tax.

(11) The vehicle license tax will also be appropriately reduced. For example, non-motor vehicles will be reduced from the original 24 catties to 1,000 catties, to 20 catties to 400 catties.

(12) Salt tax: The tax will be levied at half the original rate.

(13) Urban local surcharges: Surcharges are only allowed on public utilities and real estate, and are not allowed on other taxes such as business tax and income tax.

(14) Late payment penalties: The original penalty of 3 percent per day will be reduced to 0.5 percent to 1 percent.

Regarding collection methods, goods licenses, and valuation for tax calculation:

I. Collection Methods:

(1) Industrial and commercial tax: It is stipulated that three methods will be adopted simultaneously: self-declaration, accounting verification, and tax calculation based on rates; self-declaration, public deliberation, and democratic evaluation; and fixed quotas on a regular basis based on self-declaration, public deliberation, and democratic evaluation. For industrial and commercial businesses with sound accounting systems and reliable evidence for taxation, their business tax and income tax will generally be based on the records and calculations in the books, using the method of self-declaration, accounting verification, and tax calculation based on rates. For industrial and commercial businesses whose accounting systems are not yet sound, the method of self-declaration, public deliberation, and democratic evaluation will be adopted, but the evaluation must also meet the standards of the tax rate and must not be higher or lower than the tax rate. Before the evaluation, the operating scale of each industry should be divided into at least three levels: large, medium, and small. Each level should then be divided into three grades according to its business situation: upper, middle, and lower. A certain proportion of typical households should be selected for each level to conduct typical investigations to obtain the standard business volume and income amount for each industry and each grade within each industry. Then, the evaluation committee of each industry or each district will conduct evaluations separately. All evaluation work will be jointly consulted and jointly responsible by the tax authorities and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to ensure fairness, reasonableness, and tax calculation based on rates. Industrial and commercial households that are taxed using democratic evaluation methods, if they continue to improve their accounting systems and are indeed qualified for tax calculation based on accounting verification, may be changed to self-declaration, accounting verification, and tax calculation based on rates after approval. The method of regular fixed-quota taxation is suitable for small industrial and commercial households without sound accounting books. An evaluation can generally be conducted once a year, and after the evaluation, the tax amount payable will be fixed and paid once a month or every two months, remaining unchanged throughout the year. Regardless of which of the above three methods is adopted, the collection figures estimated according to the tax rate are still indispensable, but they are only for reference, and it must be ensured that the tax is levied according to the tax rate, not more, nor less.

(2) Income tax: It is planned to estimate and levy it once every six months, and settle it at the end of the year, with refunds for overpayments and supplementary payments for underpayments.

(3) If the headquarters and branches have the same capital and do not calculate profits and losses separately, regardless of whether they are located in the local area or elsewhere, their business tax should be paid in the place where their business activities take place; income tax should be paid by the headquarters in a consolidated manner. If the headquarters and branches divide their capital and calculate profits and losses separately, all industrial and commercial taxes should be paid separately. Internal transfers of goods between headquarters and branches at the original price should not be regarded as business activities and should not be subject to business tax.

(4) If industrial and commercial households establish purchasing agencies in other places independently or jointly, and only purchase but do not sell, they will not be subject to business tax.

(5) With approval, two or more factories may establish joint operating agencies in the local area or elsewhere. The following provisions are made regarding whether to pay taxes and how to pay taxes: Jointly purchasing raw materials for their own use is exempt from industrial and commercial tax. Jointly undertaking orders and allocating them to various factories for production is exempt from industrial and commercial tax. Jointly promoting goods, if the selling price minus necessary expenses such as transportation costs is higher than the original factory price, the entire sales amount will be taxed at the rate for the trading industry; if it is not higher than the original factory price, it will be taxed at the rate for the manufacturing industry. If the joint operating agency obtains a difference in revenue, the difference in revenue will be taxed according to the commission rate.

(6) For special agency sales business between public and private manufacturers, the agency fee will be taxed according to the commission rate.

(7) If fixed industrial and commercial businesses temporarily send personnel to other places to promote goods, they must pay business tax to the tax authorities in the place of sale.

(8) Temporary commercial tax can only be levied after the goods are sold and cannot be pre-collected.

II. Goods License Issues:

(1) For eleven types of goods, including cement, flat glass, records, tungsten, antimony, beer, wheat flour, cotton yarn, porcelain, canned goods, and beverages, after the tax is paid upon leaving the factory, it is no longer necessary to obtain a distribution license or go through distribution procedures.

(2) For agricultural, forestry, and mineral products such as tea, bamboo, wood, mineral sand, and coal, the method of issuing goods licenses for transportation within designated areas should be adopted as much as possible. Goods transported outside the designated area are no longer required to obtain a distribution license or go through distribution procedures.

III. Valuation for Tax Calculation Issues:

(1) The tax calculation formula for the goods tax will remain the same: average wholesale market price ÷ (1 + tax rate) = taxable price. However, the regulations on calculating tax based on the factory price and not exceeding the first wholesale market price should be strictly implemented.

(2) Exported goods, under unfavorable export conditions, may be refunded the goods tax after approval.

(3) Adjustment of tax prices: The original requirement was that adjustments could only be made when the price fluctuation range reached 15 percent, but now that prices are tending to stabilize, the adjustment range is changed to 10 percent.

IV. It is decided to conduct a re-evaluation of industrial and commercial assets and capital adjustment by the end of December 1950.

V. It is decided to establish tax reconsideration committees in major and medium-sized cities, composed of tax offices, bureaus of industry and commerce, federations of industry and commerce, and trade unions, etc., convened by the tax bureau, to reconsider matters related to the total amount of collection, disputes, and penalties.

Last year, the collection of agricultural grain generally reached 17 percent of the total agricultural output, and with local surcharges, it was around 20 percent. In order to ensure the supply of the revolutionary war, the peasants made efforts for the country. As of now, the autumn grain collection last year has completed 97 percent of the original target. It should be pointed out that the collection of agricultural grain in the new areas last year was completed under extremely difficult conditions. The cadres in the old areas did not understand the situation in the new areas and did not have any collection materials to rely on. In most areas, they had to use the old Baojia personnel. The bandits and reactionaries organized by the Kuomintang openly or secretly sabotaged the grain collection work. According to incomplete statistics, more than 3,000 cadres sacrificed their lives for the grain collection work. These comrades fulfilled their duties for the country and ultimately sacrificed their lives. Also, due to the above circumstances, the grain collection work last year was not done very carefully, and there were many shortcomings and mistakes. First of all, we did not have time to formulate a unified collection method. If there was a unified collection method, certain deviations could have been avoided. The Central Finance and Economics Committee should be responsible for this point. The burden on the population was narrow, generally not reaching 80 percent of the rural population. The progressive rate was too high, and some landlords' burdens exceeded 80 percent or even 100 percent of their total agricultural income. In order to ensure the completion of the task, grain administration organs at all levels added surcharges at each level. Grain collection work is related to the affairs of millions of people. In most areas, this work was simply handed over to grain collection personnel instead of the leading cadres taking charge and doing it themselves. Before and during the grain collection, there was no widespread publicity to the masses to explain the grain collection policy and methods clearly. In some places, grain collection cadres even engaged in random arrests, beatings, and fines. All of the above deviations must be corrected in future grain collection work.

In order to adjust the agricultural tax, both to meet the needs of the country and to meet the requirements of the peasants, the following guidelines and methods must be adopted:

(1) Fixed burden ratio. The Government Administration Council's decision on the collection of agricultural grain in the summer of 1950 stipulates that the progressive rate for the collection from various classes, based on households, should not exceed 10 percent of their summer harvest for poor peasants, 15 percent for middle peasants, 25 percent for rich peasants, and 50 percent for landlords. In special cases, it should not exceed 80 percent. This provision is appropriate. In the future, all collections should be based on rates and should not be exceeded or reduced.

(2) To encourage the enthusiasm of peasants for production, all collections should be calculated based on the normal yield of the land. Those who exceed the normal yield of the same land due to diligent farming and good management will not be charged more; those whose harvest is less than the harvest of the same land due to lazy farming will not be charged less.

(3) In order to make the agricultural grain work fair and reasonable, all localities must conduct a yield survey and evaluation before the autumn harvest. In areas where land reform has not been carried out or has not been completed, the land can be divided into several grades according to local customs, such as irrigated land, dry land, hillside, etc., and each grade can be further divided into three levels: upper, middle, and lower. A certain proportion can be drawn out to conduct typical investigations to find out the normal yield per mu of each grade and level of land, which will serve as the basis for the autumn collection. In areas where land reform has been completed, a general survey should be conducted in conjunction with the issuance of land certificates to fix the land yield.

(4) During this year's summer grain collection, leading cadres at all levels must personally take responsibility, go to the countryside to mobilize, explain the grain collection policies, standards, and methods clearly to the masses, and truly help the grain collection cadres to avoid making commandist mistakes and ensure that the tax is calculated and levied according to the rates. The area is wider and the tax amount is larger during the autumn collection, so this must be done even more.

(5) A unified national agricultural tax law must be formulated and implemented. This tax law should stipulate the tax rate, collection method, scope of collection, the population covered by the collection, calculation standards, yield evaluation, and strictly stipulate that no surcharges are allowed at any level, and it should be promulgated before the autumn collection this year.

(6) Agricultural tax should only be levied on agricultural main products. The transaction tax in rural areas was originally set up to oppose the feudal exploitation of brokers, but later the collection became too broad, which was detrimental to the people. In the future, the transaction tax should only be applied in places with brokers' markets. All public-owned stores, cooperatives, fixed industrial and commercial businesses, and people who directly trade without going through brokers and traders will not be subject to the transaction tax. No peddling tax will be levied on peasants who sell household handicrafts and agricultural and sideline products.

The above is my report on adjusting the tax work. Please review it.

　　关于调整税收问题
    （一九五○年六月十五日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的报告）
    薄一波各位委员、各位同志们！
    八个月来，人民政府的财政和税收工作，在保障一九五○年度全国收支概算上做了一些工作。截至今年五月底止，关税完成了全年任务的百分之三十三点四五，盐税完成了百分之二十五，工商业税货物税地方税合计完成了百分之三十五点四五，秋季公粮完成了百分之九十七。这些数字的完成，加上第一期公债推销了将近九千万分，使国家的财政情况起了很大变化。城市税收的作用提高了，达到了和农村公粮收入相等的地步。有计划的税收制度开始代替了曾经是被迫采用的难以掌握的发行大量纸币的办法，从而把国家的财政安放在比较巩固的基础之上。今年三月以后，出现了收支接近平衡、物价趋于稳定的局面。这些成绩之所以获得，应归功于全国人民的支持和广大工作人员的努力。
    我们在税收工作中，存在着许多缺点和错误。正如刘少奇副主席所说：“我们这些医院的医生和助手们，并非个个都是高明的，各种设备和药剂的准备也不完全，这样就使一些本来可以避免的痛苦和困难，没有能够避免”。比如我们在公布工商业税、货物税两个主要税法时，未能同时公布施行细则，以致各地税局对于税法条文的解释和引用极不一致。税收任务是按税率估定的，这在财政工作上是不可少的，但执行起来，就曾发生过任务和税率相互矛盾的现象。在税种、税目和管理手续上，有些本来是可以简化，减少货物周转和工商业者纳税的困难，但没有及时简化。工商业税包括营业税和所得税在内，根据税率的自报公议民主评定，是依率计征条件还不具备时一种比较合理的和必需采取的办法，但在评定中，不少地区又发生了小挤大、大挤小以至负担不公的现象。税收干部积极工作，负责完成国家所赋予的任务，是好的，但作风有时比较生硬，引起了许多纳税人的反感。此外在税收干部中，有百分之九十以上系留用人员，其中绝大部分是好的，努力工作的，但也有一些仍然因袭国民党时代的作风，并有贪污受贿情事。其原因主要是由于经验不够和教育不够。只要我们财经主管机关注意这些，能及时分析情况、总结经验、规定正确的税则、税率和征收方法，教育全体干部，过去的缺点和错误就可以改正，满足人民的期望。
    为了从税收方面调整公私关系，根据毛主席的指示，召开了包括工商业者代表在内的各大行政区各省区各大中城市的税务局长会议，根据共同纲领第四十条第二节的规定：“国家的税收政策，应以保障革命战争的供给，照顾生产的恢复和发展，及国家建设的需要为原则，简化税制，实行合理负担”，对税收问题决作如下的调整：
    关于税种、税目、税率诸问题：
    一、税种：今年一月二十七日公布的全国税政实施要则共为十四种，即货物税、工商税、盐税、关税、薪资报酬所得税、存款利息所得税、印花税、遗产税、交易税、屠宰税、房产税、地产税、特种消费行为税、使用牌照税。决将薪资报酬所得税和遗产税两种暂不开征，地产税和房产税两种合并为一种，即将原定的十四种减为十一种。
    二、税目：关于货物税和印花税修正如下：
    （一）货物税品目：全部免征者，有陶器、石灰、土制砖瓦、自来水笔零件、钟表零件、留声机零件、汽车及汽车零件、土硝和腊烛等；一部免征者，有橡胶制品、玻璃制品、五金类、电料类、自行车零件、矿产品、皮革和植物油等。免征品目共三八七个。合并征收者，有棉织品合并在棉纱内征收，毛织品合并在毛纱内征收，纸的品目亦加合并等。这样一来，又减少品目三九一个。两项共减少七七八个品目，原品目一一三六个，减并后剩下三五八个。
    （二）印花税：有的沿用国民党时代印花税法，共三十六目。有的用中央人民政府财政部印花税条例草案，共三十目。税务会议根据财政部草案，减去职工领薪收据、身份或资格证照、各种许可证照、运输护照、结婚证书、延聘证书和受聘证书，总分支店往来对账之日记账、月计表和对账性质的抄单，洗染单，存户取息不足起征点的收据，共减去五目，剩下二十五目。
    三、税率：
    （一）营业税，按营业总收入额计税部分，仍维持百分之一至百分之三的税率；按营业总收益额计税部分，仍维持百分之一点五至百分之六的税率；另划出按营业收益额佣金计税的部分，规定税率为由百分之十至百分之二十。
    （二）所得税，仍维持百分之五至百分之三十的税率，但将起征点从一百万元提高到三百万元，均适用百分之五的税率。最高累进点，从三千万元提高到一万万元，始适用百分之三十的税率。并将累进级数由十四级增到二十级，级数增加，累进放缓。
    （三）临时商业税，将原百分之四到百分之六累进征收，改为一律按百分之五比例征收。
    （四）货物税中，纸烟税率由原百分之一百二十从价征税，减为百分之九十至百分之一百二十分四级从价征收。改制酒税率，由原百分之一百二十，减为百分之五十。改性酒精，由原百分之一百二十，减为百分之三十。棉纱与棉织品合并征收，按原税率应为百分之十六点四，减为百分之十五。毛纱与毛织品合并征收，按原税率应为百分之三十，减为百分之二十。火柴从原定百分之二十，减为百分之十五。
    （五）印花税，缩小按金额比例征收范围，扩大按件贴花范围。如商事凭证，除发货票仍按千分之三贴花外，售货银钱收据等均改为按件贴花。
    （六）利息所得税，原只私人行庄按所得额百分之十计征，国家银行不征收。现决定公私银行一律征收，税率由百分之十减为百分之五。
    （七）交易税，确定征收范围，只对有牙纪市场者始得征收。公营商店、合作社、固定工商业和不经过牙纪与交易员成交者，均不得征收。
    （八）房产税和地产税税目合并，分别计征。原房产税从价征税由百分之一到百分之一点五，地产税由百分之一点五到百分之四累进征收。现定房产税一律按百分之一，地产税一律按百分之一点五比例征收。国家机关部队团体所住公共房屋，概不征税。
    （九）特种消费行为税，筵席税的起征点从一万元提高到五万元，冷食税从五千元提高到一万元，旅馆业规定每日每房间三万元以上者，始得征收。
    （十）屠宰税，广东征异地屠宰税，继续征收。人民和政府机关部队团体，自养自宰自食的牲畜，不征屠宰税。
    （十一）使用牌照税亦酌量减低，如非机动车从原来的二十四斤到一千斤，减为从二十斤到四百斤。
    （十二）盐税，按原规定减半征收。
    （十三）城市地方附加，只准在公用事业和房地产内附加，其他如营业税、所得税内不准附加。
    （十四）滞纳金，由原按日课百分之三的罚金减至百分之零点五到百分之一。
    关于征收方法、货照、评价计税诸问题：
    一、征收方法：
    （一）工商业税，规定为自报查账依率计征、自报公议民主评定和在自报公议民主评定基础上的定期定额这三种方法，同时采用。凡工商业有健全的会计制度，可资征税确据者，其营业税和所得税概依账簿的记载和计算，采自报查账、依率计征的方法。凡工商业会计制度尚不健全者，采自报公议民主评定的方法，但亦要评到合乎税率的标准，不许高于或低于税率。评议前，得根据各行业的经营规模，至少分成大中小三等，每等视其营业状况再分为上中下三级，分别选择一定比例的典型户，进行典型调查，求得各行业和各行业中间各等级的标准营业额和所得额，然后由各行业或各区评议委员会分别进行评议。所有评议工作，统由税务机关和工商联合会共同协商，共同负责，务期达到公平合理、依率计征的目的。用民主评议征收的工商业户，如不断改善其会计制度，确已具备查账计税的条件者，经核准得改为自报查账，依率计征。定期定额征税方法，适用于没有健全账簿的小的工商业户，每年大体可进行一次评议，评定后则固定其应纳税额，按一个月或两个月交纳一次，通年不变。不管采用上述三种方法中的那一种方法，依照税率估计的征收数字，仍然是不可少的，但只是作为参考，必须做到按照税率，不征多，亦不征少。
    （二）所得税，拟定半年估征一次，年终结算，多退少补。
    （三）总分支机构如资本合一，不单独计算盈亏者，不论设于本埠外埠，其营业税应各就其营业行为所在地交纳；所得税由总机构汇总缴纳。总分支机构间资本划分，单独计算盈亏者，所有工商业税应分别各自交纳。总分支机构按原价内部调拨货物，不得视为营业行为，不征营业税。
    （四）工商业户单独地或者联合地在外埠设立采办机构，只采购不贩卖者，不征收营业税。
    （五）凡两个以上工厂，经批准后，得在本埠或外埠设立联营机构，纳税与否并如何纳税，规定如下：联合采办原料，专供自用者，免征工商业税。联合承揽定货，分配联合各厂承造者，免征工商业税。联合推销货品，如售价减去必要费用如运费等，高于原厂价出售者，按销货全额，以贩卖业税率课税；不高于原厂价者，按制造业税率课税。联营机构如获有差额收益时，其差额收益，按佣金例课税。
    （六）公私厂商特约代销业务，就其代销手续费，依佣金例课税。
    （七）固定工商业临时派员到外埠推销货品者，须向销货地税务机关交纳营业税。
    （八）临时商业税，售货后始得征税，不准预征。
    二、货照问题：
    （一）水泥、平面玻璃、唱片、钨、锑、啤酒、麦粉、棉纱、瓷器、罐头、饮料等十一种货品，完税出厂后，不再领取分运照，不再办分运手续。
    （二）农林矿产品，如茶叶、竹木、矿砂、煤等货品，尽量采用划区货照同行办法，货物运出划区外，不再领分运照，不再办分运手续。
    三、评价计税问题：
    （一）货物税计税公式仍维持：市场平均批发价格÷（１＋税率）＝完税价格。但应严格执行按出厂价格计税和不超过第一次市场批发价格的规定。
    （二）出口货物，在出口不利的情况下，经过批准后，可以退货物税。
    （三）调整税价，原定物价涨落幅度达百分之十五的时候才可以调整，现在物价趋于稳定，调整幅度改为百分之十。
    四、定于一九五○年十二月底，举办工商业资产重估和资本调整。
    五、决定各大中城市成立税务复议委员会，由税务所、工商局、工商联合会和工会等方面组成，由税务局负责召集，复议有关征收总额、争议和处罚等事项。
    去年征收公粮，一般达到农业总产量的百分之十七的比例，加上地方附加，则在百分之二十上下。为了保障革命战争的供给，农民对国家是出了力的。去年秋季公粮，截至现在止，完成了原订任务的百分之九十七。应该指出，去年新区征收公粮是在极端困难的情况下去完成的，老区干部对新区情况不了解，没有可资依据的征粮材料，大多数地区还不得不利用旧保甲人员。国民党所组织的土匪和反动派公开地或秘密地破坏征粮工作，根据不完全的统计，为征收公粮而牺牲的干部在三千人以上，这些同志是为国家尽了职而最后牺牲了性命的。也由于以上这些情况，去年征粮工作是做得很不细致的，缺点和错误是很多的。首先我们没有来得及制定一个统一的征收办法，如果有一个统一的征收办法，某些偏差可以避免，此点中财委应负责任。负担的人口面较窄，一般没有达到农村人口的百分之八十。累进率太高，有些地主负担超过其农业总收入的百分之八十甚至百分之百。各级粮政机关，为了保障任务的完成，有层层附加的情形。征粮工作是关系千百万群众的事情，大多地区，把这一工作简单地交给征粮人员去做，而不是首长负责亲自动手。在征粮开始前和征粮中间，也没有向群众作广泛宣传，把征粮政策和征粮办法讲清楚。某些地方征粮干部则曾经发生过乱押、乱打、乱罚的事情。所有以上这些偏差，在今后征粮工作中，都是必须纠正的。
    为了调整农业税，既满足国家的需要，又满足农民的要求，必须采取下列各项方针和办法：
    （一）固定负担比率。政务院关于一九五○年夏征公粮的决定，对各阶层的征收累进率，以户为单位征收，贫农最高不得超过其夏收的百分之十，中农最高不得超过其夏收的百分之十五，富农不得超过其夏收的百分之二十五，地主不得超过其夏收的百分之五十，特殊者亦不得超过其夏收的百分之八十，这一规定是适当的。以后征收，一律按率计征，不得超过，亦不得减少。
    （二）为鼓励农民生产的积极性，征收一律按土地的常年应产量计算，因勤劳耕作和善于经营，超过相同土地的常年应产量者，不多征；因怠于耕作，其收获量不及相同土地的收获量者，不少征。
    （三）为了把公粮工作做到公平合理的程度，各地必需在秋收前进行一次产量调查和评产量的工作。没有土改或土改未完成的地区，可将土地按当地人民习惯分成水旱山坡几等，每等中再分成上中下三级，抽出一定比例，进行典型调查，求出各等各级田亩的常年应产量来，做为秋征的根据。土改已经完成的地区，则应结合发土地证进行普查，把土地产量固定下来。
    （四）今年夏征公粮时，各级首长，必须亲自负责，下乡动员，向群众讲清楚征粮政策、标准和办法，并确实帮助征粮干部，不犯命令主义的错误，做到依率计征。秋征时地区更宽，税量更大，更必须这样做。
    （五）必须制定一个全国统一的农业税法，付诸实施。这一税法，应规定税率、征收方法、征收范围、征收的人口面、计算标准、评产量和严格规定不准层层附加等，并在今年秋征前公布出来。
    （六）农业税只征收农业正产物。农村中的交易税，原来是为了反对牙纪的封建剥削而设的，但后来征收过宽，反于人民不利。今后交易税，只适用于有牙纪市场的地方。举凡公营商店、合作社、固定工商业和人民，不经过牙纪交易员直接成交者，一律不征交易税。对农民推销家庭手工业品和农副业品，一律不征行商税。
    以上就是我对于调整税收工作的报告，请各位加以审议。
