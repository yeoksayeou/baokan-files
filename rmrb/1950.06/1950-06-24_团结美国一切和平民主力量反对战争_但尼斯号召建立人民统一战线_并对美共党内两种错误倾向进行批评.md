Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: The journal "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy," published on June 2nd, carried a report by Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, at the National Committee meeting of the CPUSA held from March 23rd to 25th this year.

In his report, Dennis pointed out that within many organizations of the CPUSA, on the one hand, there exists right-leaning opportunism that underestimates the fighting spirit of the working people; on the other hand, there also exists a serious "left"-leaning sectarian tendency of failing to differentiate between reactionary labor leaders and the broad masses of workers under their influence, and of limiting their activities to narrow circles. These two tendencies have greatly hindered the development of the Party's work and the implementation of correct policies. After calling for the swift and decisive eradication of these two tendencies, Dennis pointed out that the central task of the Communist Party of the United States at this stage is to vigorously conduct mass work, establish a broad people's united front under the leadership of the working class, and strive for opposition to war, opposition to fascism and Wall Street monopoly capital, and for friendly relations with the Soviet Union and peaceful cooperation. The Party must carry out extensive political and organizational work among factory workers and all people's organizations, and around some key issues of current concern to the people, such as the prohibition of atomic bombs, reconciliation with the Soviet Union, and defeating Taft-Hartley, unite all labor, democratic, and peace forces to achieve the broadest unity of action. However, within such a broad united front, the Party must maintain itself as the independent, Marxist, organized vanguard of the working class, retain the right to criticize, and put forward its own program on all key issues.

When discussing the court struggle of the CPUSA leaders, Dennis emphasized the glorious struggle of the CPUSA leaders in court to defend the Party and defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Dennis then pointed out, when discussing the issue of violent revolution, that in the course of the court struggle, the Party, in explaining that it did not advocate violence, did not sufficiently defend the historical and democratic right of the people to carry out revolution, and did not fully clarify the Party's position on the laws of proletarian revolution. Dennis pointed out that carrying out revolution is a democratic tradition and an undeniable right of the American working class and the masses of the people. More emphasis on this point would be a powerful blow to anti-communist slander and would help all people in their struggle for national independence and social liberation.

　　团结美国一切和平民主力量反对战争
    但尼斯号召建立人民统一战线
    并对美共党内两种错误倾向进行批评
    【新华社二十三日讯】六月二日出版的“争取持久和平、争取人民民主”报刊载美国共产党总书记但尼斯在今年三月二十三日至二十五日举行的美共全国委员会会议上的报告。
    但尼斯在报告中指出：在美共许多组织中，一方面存在着低估劳动人民战斗情绪的右倾机会主义；另一方面，也存在着把反动劳工领袖与其影响下的广大工人不加区别的、把自己活动局限在狭仄圈子中的严重的“左”倾宗派主义的倾向。这两种倾向大大地妨碍了党的工作的展开和正确政策的执行。但尼斯在号召迅速而决定性地根除这两种倾向后指出：美国共产党现阶段的中心任务，在于大力进行群众工作，建立一个工人阶级领导下的广泛的人民的统一战线，为反对战争、反对法西斯主义及华尔街独占资本，争取对苏友好与和平合作而斗争。党必须在工厂工人及一切人民团体中，进行极大的政治工作和组织工作，围绕当前人民所关怀的一些关键问题，如禁止原子弹、对苏和好、击败蒙特法等等，汇合一切劳工、民主、和平的力量，达成最广泛的行动统一。但在这样广泛的统一战线中，党必须保持自身为工人阶级独立的、马克思主义的、有组织的先锋队伍，保持批评的权利，并在一切关键问题上提出自己的纲领。
    但尼斯在论及美共领袖的法庭斗争时，强调指出美共领袖们在法庭上为保卫党、保卫马列主义原则而进行的光辉斗争。但尼斯接着在论及暴力革命问题时指出，在进行法庭斗争中，党在说明它并未主张暴力时，没有足够地保卫人民进行革命之历史的和民主的权利，没有充分地阐明党对于无产阶级革命法则的立场。但尼斯指出，进行革命乃是美国工人阶级及人民大众的民主传统和不可否认的权利。这点若得到更多的强调，将会是对于反共诽谤的有力打击，并有助于一切人民争取民族独立及社会解放的斗争。
