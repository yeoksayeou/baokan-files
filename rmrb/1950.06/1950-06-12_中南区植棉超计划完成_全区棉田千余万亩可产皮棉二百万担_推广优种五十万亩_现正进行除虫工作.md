　　Central and Southern China Overfulfills Cotton Planting Plan
    Total Cotton Fields in the Region Exceed Ten Million Mu, Expected to Produce Two Million Dan of Ginned Cotton
    Popularizing Improved Varieties on 500,000 Mu; Pest Control Work Underway
    [Hankou News] Changjiang Daily News: The Central People's Government assigned the Central and Southern China region the task of planting 10,270,000 mu of cotton in 1950, which has now been overfulfilled. In order to promote cotton planting in the region, the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee dispatched a large number of cadres to Hubei, Henan, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces in early March to assist in promoting cotton planting. In the past two months, the cotton planting area in the four provinces has reached a total of 11,444,318 mu, and it is estimated that 2,819,844 dan of ginned cotton can be produced, an increase of 1,174,318 mu over the task assigned by the Central Government, and the output can be increased by 350,880 dan.
    In the cotton planting movement, all regions have paid attention to the promotion of improved varieties. The existing improved varieties in the Central and Southern China region include seven categories: Ambassador Cotton, S-Character Cotton, German Cotton, Chicken Foot German Cotton, Ke-Character Cotton, Dai-Character Cotton, and Changzi No. 1 Cotton. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 4,474,707 jin of various improved varieties have been promoted and propagated this year, planted on 500,7612 mu.
    Now is the seedling growth period of cotton, in addition to guiding cultivation, pest control work has become an important task in cotton production in the future. The Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, in addition to informing the provinces to organize farmers to prevent pests early and quickly eliminate aphid damage, is also formulating specific measures for the prevention and control of cotton aphids for distribution to the provinces for implementation, and is also equipping pest control cadres to go to the key cotton-producing provinces to assist in the work. The provinces in the region have made considerable preparations for medicines and equipment for the prevention and control of cotton pests. There are currently 100,000 jin of cotton oil soap, 82,300 jin of D.D.T., 1,750 jin of rotenone, 5,848 sprayers, 700 dusters, and "Mass Dusters" researched and manufactured by the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee. The duster is simple to manufacture and inexpensive (the cost of each is about one jin of rice), making it easy for the masses to imitate or purchase. The Agriculture and Forestry Department has now manufactured 600 sample dusters, which have been distributed to the provinces for mass imitation and use.

　　中南区植棉超计划完成
    全区棉田千余万亩可产皮棉二百万担
    推广优种五十万亩  现正进行除虫工作
    【汉口讯】长江日报消息：中央人民政府分配中南区一九五零年植棉一千零二十七万市亩的任务，现已超计划完成。为推动全区植棉工作，中南军政委员会农林部曾于三月上旬配备大批干部，分赴鄂、豫、湘、赣四省，协助推广植棉工作。两月来，四省植棉面积共达一千一百四十四万四千三百一十八市亩，预计可产皮棉二百八十一万九千八百四十四市担，较中央分配任务增加一百一十七万四千三百一十八市亩，产量可增加三十五万零八百八十市担。
    在植棉运动中，各地均注意了优良品种的推广。中南区现有的优良品种，计有大使棉、斯字棉、德字棉、鸡脚德字棉、珂字棉、岱字棉及常紫一号棉等七类。据初步统计，今年各地共推广繁殖各种优良品种共计四百四十七万四千七百零七斤，种植五十万零七千六百一十二亩。
    现正值棉花幼苗生长期，除指导培育外，防治害虫工作已成为今后棉花生产中的重要任务。中南军政委员会农林部，遵照中央人民政府农业部指示，除转知各省组织农民及早防虫、迅速扑灭蚜害外，并一面拟定防治棉蚜具体办法分发各省施行，一面配备治虫干部分赴各产棉重点省份协助工作。该区各省防治棉虫药品器械已有相当准备。现有棉油皂十万斤，Ｄ、Ｄ、Ｔ、八万二千三百斤，鱼藤精一千七百五十斤，喷雾器五千八百四十八架，喷粉器七百架，另有中南军政委员会农林部研究制造的“大众撒粉器”。该撒粉器制法简单，成本低廉（每具成本约大米一斤），群众易于仿造或购买。现已由农林部制造样品六百具，分发各省大量仿造使用。
