　　Guarantee Normal Urban Housing Rental Relationships
    Measures for Compulsory Enforcement of Rental Disputes Promulgated by the Municipal People's Court
    [Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] In order to protect normal urban housing rental relationships and ensure the smooth execution of mediation and judgments in housing dispute cases, the Beijing Municipal People's Court, in accordance with the spirit of the Beijing Municipal Military Control Commission's proclamation on housing issues last year and based on the experience of handling housing cases over the past year, has formulated measures for the compulsory enforcement of housing rental dispute cases, which have been approved by the Beijing Municipal People's Government and implemented as of June 2nd. The court's announcement office and the entrances of district public offices have posted notices of these measures. The measures stipulate that in all housing dispute cases where the People's Court has mediated a settlement or made a judgment requiring the tenant to return the property, if the tenant fails to do so within the specified time, the Enforcement Division of the People's Court, in conjunction with the local police station, will forcibly evict the tenant upon the landlord's request for compulsory enforcement; if the tenant still refuses to move, their furniture and belongings may be transported to a warehouse for temporary storage. If the person being forcibly evicted does not apply to reclaim their furniture and belongings and pay the removal and storage fees within three months, the People's Court may immediately auction them off, deduct the removal and storage fees, and return the remaining funds.

    As for urban poor who genuinely have difficulties moving, but whose rent arrears affect the implementation of urban housing policy, these households will be ordered to first register for immigration or return to their hometowns at the Civil Affairs Bureau, and appropriate consideration will be given to the deadline for handing over the property in the judgment. If they still fail to comply after the deadline, the court will enforce the eviction. (Peng Chen)

　　保证城市房屋正常租赁关系
    租赁纠纷强制执行办法  市人民法院公布施行
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民法院为了保护城市房屋正常租赁关系，贯彻房屋纠纷案件调解和判决的顺利执行起见，特根据去年京市军管会关于房屋问题布告的精神和一年来处理房屋案件的经验，拟定房屋租赁纠纷案件强制执行办法，已呈准京市人民政府自六月二日起实行。法院揭示处和各区公所门首已张贴该办法的公告。该办法规定：凡属房屋纠纷案件，经人民法院调解成立或判决确定应由房客交回房屋者，如逾期不交，经房主声请强制执行者，由人民法院执行科会同当地派出所强制迁移；如房客仍不迁移时，得将其家具什物运存仓库，暂予保管。如被强制交房人逾三个月不申请领回其家具什物并缴纳搬运费和保管费，人民法院得即予拍卖，扣除搬运费和保管费后，将余款发还。
    至于一般城市贫民腾房确有困难，但因拖欠房租致影响城市房屋政策之执行者，则限令该住户先赴民政局办理移民登记或还乡登记，在判决交房期限上给予适当的照顾，如逾期仍不履行者，由法院强制执行之。（彭忱）
