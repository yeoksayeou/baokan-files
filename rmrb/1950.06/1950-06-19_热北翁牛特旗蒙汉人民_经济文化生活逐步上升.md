(Chengde News) Chengde Mass Daily News: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Mongolian and Han people of Ongniud Banner in northern Rehe Province have gradually shaken off poverty and backwardness, and their lives have begun to improve, presenting a brand-new outlook.

　　Ongniud Banner is a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area. In the past, the economic and cultural life of the Mongolian and Han people was extremely backward. After August 15, 1945, the Communist Party came here, established a People's Government, and implemented social reforms. The awareness of farmers and herdsmen has been raised, and new developments have been made in agriculture, livestock, culture, and health.

　　In agriculture, the farming technology was backward in the past. Farmers and herdsmen only planted "scattered seed" fields, plowing the land once in the spring, sowing the seeds, and waiting until the autumn harvest without any further processing. A few people knew how to plant "ridged fields," but the cultivation was not meticulous. Now, most farmers and herdsmen have learned to plant "ridged fields" and pay attention to cultivating and weeding, resulting in a significant increase in yields. Taking Gaorisu, Nailingao, and Xiaopaozi villages in the Lao Fu District as examples, the grain harvest in 1943 was 646 shi (each shi is 800 jin, same below), which increased to 713 shi in 1947, and further increased to 1,840 shi last year. In the past, farmers and herdsmen did not grow vegetables, but now most of them have opened up gardens and are able to eat green vegetables. In animal husbandry, there were 2,080 cattle, camels, and donkeys in 1943, which increased to 2,237 in 1947, and further increased to 2,530 last year. However, the number of horses and sheep had not recovered to the level of the puppet Manchukuo period by 1947 due to bandit looting and the killing by herdowners, but began to rise in 1948. The government has promoted the conservation of breeding stock and launched an "anti-wolf" campaign, which has increased the livestock breeding rate. In addition, Mongolian people rarely engaged in sideline production in the past. Now, under the promotion of the government, sideline occupations such as harvesting ephedra, digging licorice root, running transportation and sales, raising pigs, and raising chickens have gradually developed. According to statistics from the Lao Fu District, 60 percent of the households in the district have reached the living standards of middle peasants or above. In the aforementioned three villages of Gaorisu, etc., out of the 1,651 people in the village, 1,560 people got new clothes this spring, and 120 new houses were built and 25 new carts were purchased, giving the agricultural and pastoral areas a new look.

　　With the improvement of economic life, cultural and health undertakings have also gradually developed. Surigao Village, which never had a school in the past, now has three primary schools, and the children of farmers and herdsmen can go to school. Many young men and women have joined literacy classes. Even old men in their fifties and sixties are going to study to open their minds and understand the major affairs of the country. Adults and children enthusiastically sing the song "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No China"; they have also created many vivid turn-over ditties, and cheerful songs are floating in the grasslands and fields. Superstitious thinking has also begun to be broken. In the past, when people and animals were sick, they would find lamas to chant scriptures. When livestock died, the lamas would deceive the herdsmen by saying, "It is good to die, it suffers disaster for people. If it does not die, people will have to die." Now, the government is gradually developing medical and health services. When livestock are sick, they are taken to the animal disease prevention and treatment station for treatment. This spring, all livestock have been vaccinated.

　　热北翁牛特旗蒙汉人民  经济文化生活逐步上升
    【承德讯】承德群众日报消息：在共产党与人民政府的领导下，热河省北部翁牛特旗的蒙、汉人民，逐渐摆脱了贫困与落后，生活开始上升，出现了崭新的面貌。
    翁牛特旗是半农半牧地区，过去蒙、汉人民的经济、文化生活极为落后。一九四五年“八一五”以后，共产党来到这里，建立了人民政府，实行了社会改革。农牧民的觉悟提高了，农业、牲畜、文化和卫生等建设都有新的发展。
    在农业方面，过去耕作技术落后，农牧民只种“漫撒子”地，春天犁一遍地，撒下种子，直到秋收，并不加工。有少数人会种“大垅地”，但耕作也不细致。现在大部农牧民都学会了种“大垅地”，注意中耕除草，因之收获量大增。以老府区高日苏、乃林皋、小泡子三村为例。一九四三年收粮食六百四十六石（每石八百斤，下同），一九四七年增至七百十三石；去年增至一千八百四十石。过去农牧民都不种蔬菜，现在大部分都开辟了园子，吃到青菜了。在畜牧方面，一九四三年有牛、骆驼、驴两千零八十头，一九四七年增至两千二百三十七头，去年增至两千五百三十头。但马与羊的数目，因遭土匪抢劫和牧主杀害，到一九四七年还未恢复伪满时期水平，至一九四八年已开始上升。政府提倡了种畜的保养工作，开展了“打狼”运动，增大了牲畜繁殖率。此外，过去蒙民很少从事副业生产，现在，在政府提倡下，割麻黄、挖甘草、跑运销、养猪、养鸡等副业逐渐开展了。据老府区统计，全区户数的百分之六十已达到中农以上的生活水平。在上述的高日苏等三村，全村一千六百五十一口人中，今年春天有一千五百六十口人添了新衣，还盖了一百二十间新房子，修置了二十五辆新车，使农牧区的面目为之一新。
    随着经济生活的上升，文化、卫生事业也逐渐开展。过去从来没有过学校的苏日高村，现在建立了小学三所，农牧民的子弟都能上学了。许多青年男女参加了识字班。连五、六十岁的老头，也要去学习，要开开脑筋，明了国家的大事。大人小孩都热情地唱着“没有共产党就没有中国”的歌；他们还创造了许多生动的翻身小调，轻快的歌声飘扬在草原和田野里。迷信思想也开始打破了。过去人畜有病都是找喇嘛念经。牲口死了，喇嘛们还欺骗牧民说：“死了好，它替人受灾。它不死，人也得死。”现在，政府逐渐举办医药事业。牲畜有病都到家畜防疫所去治。今年春天，全部牲畜都施行了防疫注射。
