Xinhua News Agency, 18th: To prevent flooding this year, Hebei Province, drawing on past flood control experience, has established flood control headquarters at all levels in advance. The Provincial People's Government has also instructed People's Governments at all levels along the rivers to immediately conduct dyke inspection and material preparation work to prevent summer floods.

The province held a flood control conference in early June and established a provincial flood control headquarters. In order to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient integration between technology, administration, and the masses in past flood control work, the conference decided to establish flood control headquarters at all levels in more than 80 counties in ten special districts along the rivers, and to organize mass-based flood control standing teams, reserve teams, and rescue teams under the flood control organizations of districts and villages. Once the flood season arrives, they will be on duty on the dykes to ensure that no breaches occur under normal water volumes.

The province's spring river management project started in late March. Thanks to the central government's allocation of grain assistance and the active efforts of more than 300,000 military and civilian workers, 80 percent of the total project has been completed by early June. The entire project is expected to be completed in late June. The completion of this project will provide a good foundation for this year's flood control work.

　　河北建立各级防汛指挥部
    省府指示立即进行查堤备料
    春修治河工程已完成十分之八
    【新华社十八日讯】河北省为着免除今年水患，接受往年防汛经验，已提前建立各级防汛指挥部。该省人民政府并已指令沿河各级人民政府，立即进行查堤备料工作，以防夏汛。
    该省在六月初曾召开防汛会议，并成立了全省防汛指挥部。为着克服往年防汛工作中的技术、行政与群众之间结合不够密切的缺点，会议决定在沿河十个专区八十余县，建立各级防汛指挥部，并在区、村防汛机构下组织群众性的防汛常备队、后备队和抢险队，汛期一到，即上堤戒备，借以保证在常年水量的情况下不发生决口。
    该省春修治河工程于三月下旬动工，由于中央人民政府拨粮扶助以及三十余万军工、民工的积极努力，至六月初已完成总工程的百分之八十，全部工程预计可于六月下旬竣工。该项工程的完成，将使今年的防汛工作获得良好基础。
