    The Credit of Renminbi is Increasingly Consolidated
    Shanxi Farmers Use Currency for Transactions
    Currency Lending and Savings are Becoming Increasingly Common
    [This newspaper Taiyuan News] Due to stabilizing prices, farmers in various parts of Shanxi are happy to use currency for transactions, so the Renminbi has gradually penetrated the countryside, and currency storage and lending have become increasingly common.
    A farmer selling porcelain basins in Yijing Village, a suburb of Taiyuan, said: "In the past, when grain was used to top up money, people always gave me banknotes; now that banknotes are valuable, I want them, but people prefer to give me more grain." When the North Field Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yuci County purchases products from farmers, farmers are also willing to accept Renminbi, believing that barter trade is inconvenient and costly. When the masses in Caojiazhuang, Xin County, buy matches from vendors, they pay up to 700 yuan per pack in Renminbi, but if they exchange them for eggs, it is equivalent to 840 yuan, a loss of 140 yuan. When vendors in Guocun, Yuci County, sell earthenware pot lids, they only charge 2,000 yuan per Renminbi, but if they are exchanged for millet, they charge four jin (calculated at 700 yuan per jin of millet locally), a loss of 800 yuan. Also, Zhang Shiwen, a farmer in Caojiazhuang, Second District, Xin County, said: "On May 3rd, I sold a tree for 40,000 yuan in Renminbi. At that time, each silver dollar was worth 13,000 yuan (black market), which was worth three silver dollars; by May 24th, each silver dollar had fallen to 8,000 yuan (black market), which was worth five silver dollars. Now, after spending 2,500 yuan, I still have 37,500 yuan saved." Due to the increase in the value of Renminbi, the price of silver dollars fell by 38.47 percent in just twenty days. A farmer selling saltpeter in Xinzhuang Village, a suburb of Taiyuan, said: "When prices were unstable, I sold Renminbi in Taiyuan City. Although I didn't need some things at the time, I always tried to exchange the currency for goods to feel at ease; now that the banknotes are stable, I dare to bring the banknotes back and keep them." This shows that farmers have begun to be willing to store currency. According to a survey of six households in Yijing Village, a suburb of Taiyuan, on May 23rd, a total of 1,114,000 yuan in Renminbi had been saved in the past two months. Among them, Wei Yingui had 400,000 yuan in Renminbi stored since April 10th, and had not spent it for more than forty days. This is unprecedented in decades.
    Because of this, private lending among the masses is no longer limited to barter trade during periods of unstable prices. On April 10th, Tian Zhiguo, a farmer in Yijing Village, a suburb of Taiyuan, lent Hei Danzi (for buying a mule) 100,000 yuan in Renminbi, and it had been more than forty days by the time it was settled on May 23rd. Han Jinzhu's loan of 40,000 yuan to Lei Xigui and Yang Erxi's loan of 30,000 yuan have also been outstanding for more than twenty days.

    人民币信用日趋巩固
    山西农民用货币交易
    货币借贷与储蓄日益普遍
    【本报太原讯】由于物价趋于稳定，山西各地农民乐用货币交易，故人民币已逐渐下乡，货币存储及借贷已渐普遍。
    太原郊区义井村一位卖瓷盆的农民说：“过去粮食顶钱时，人们都要给我票子；现在票子值钱了，咱愿意要，人家又偏给的多是粮食”。榆次县北田镇供销社收购农民产品，农民也是愿意要人民币，认为实物交易不方便，且还要吃亏。忻县曹家庄群众买小贩的火柴时，用人民币每包最高七百元，但用鸡子换时则合八百四十元，吃亏一百四十元。榆次县郭村小贩在出售沙锅盖时，每个人民币仅要二千元，但如用小米换时，则要四斤（按当地每斤小米七百元计，合二千八百元），也吃亏了八百元。又，忻县二区曹家庄农民张世文说：“五月三日，我卖了一棵树价人民币四万元，当时每块白洋一万三千元（黑市），可值三块白洋；到五月二十四日每块白洋下降为八千元（黑市）就可值五块白洋。现在我除花用了二千五百元，还存着三万七千五百元。”由于人民币币值提高，白洋就在短短的二十天内下降了百分之三八·四七。太原郊区新庄村一位卖硝盐的农民说：“物价不稳时，我在太原市卖下了人民币，虽然有些东西当时并不甚需要，但总要设法把货币换成实物才安心；现在票子稳了，所以敢把票子带回来放了。”这说明了农民已开始愿意储存货币了。据太原郊区义井村五月二十三日，就六户农民调查统计，两月以来，已共储存人民币一百一十一万四千元。其中蔚银贵从四月十日即存有人民币四十万元直到五月二十三日已有四十多天还未用出去。这是数十年来所未有的事。
    正因为如此，群众相互之间的私人借贷也已不局限于物价不稳时的实物借贷。太原郊区义井村农民田治国四月十日，借给该村黑旦子（买骡子用）人民币十万元，到五月二十三日了结时也已四十多天。韩金柱借给雷喜贵的四万元与杨二喜的三万元也都在二十天以上。
