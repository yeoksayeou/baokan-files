　　Shenyang State-Owned Machinery Factories
    Study the Draft Trade Union Law
    [This Dispatch from Shenyang] Branch trade unions in state-owned machinery factories in Shenyang have, under the unified leadership of the trade union, universally begun studying the "Draft Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China" in mid-May. This study began with trade union cadres, then organized group workers to study, and conducted discussions in production groups. Through this study, workers' understanding of trade unions has been generally improved. (Zhao Zhongduo)
