After more than 50,000 young people in the capital held a mobilization rally for the peace signature campaign on May 18, more than 40,000 students in the city have now signed, accounting for more than 90% of the city's university and middle school students.

In Tianjin, by the end of May, 39,850 students had signed.

In Wuhan, more than 23,000 students have signed.

In Shenyang, some schools have launched studies of the "People's Daily" editorial and the documents of the World Peace Congress. Youth League members in factories have actively responded to the signature campaign. For example, at the May First Factory, led by more than 1,000 Youth League members, more than 4,000 workers signed within three days.

More than 2,000 Youth League cadres in Shanghai held a mobilization rally for Shanghai youth cadres to defend world peace on May 30. At the meeting, Zhang Ben, secretary of the Shanghai Working Committee of the Youth League, called on everyone to take action and strive for the participation of 300,000 young people in Shanghai in the signature campaign.

Youth and students in various places not only signed themselves but also used signature collection, visits, propaganda teams, Yangge dance teams, and blackboards to publicize to the masses. In Chongqing, students, workers, and shop employees organized more than 200 propaganda teams to conduct propaganda in various districts of the city. The youth crew group of the Mudanjiang train section collected signatures from passengers while the train was running. Students from the Changchun Provincial Xinji Middle School mobilized more than 13,000 citizens to sign the peace appeal after conducting propaganda through temple fairs, "Pian Er" shows, wall newspapers, visits, and broadcasts. Students from Xinji Middle School in Hebei Province collected 8,766 signatures from the masses after conducting propaganda through temple fairs, "Pian Er" shows, wall posters, visits, and broadcasts.

Children in various places are also actively participating in the peace signature campaign. The International Children's Day celebrations held in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Baoding, and other places all issued calls to children and their parents to respond to the peace signature campaign. At the International Children's Day celebration in Lanzhou, more than 20,000 children signed on the spot. More than 40 primary schools in Kaifeng launched a peace signature campaign to welcome International Children's Day, and more than 20,000 children had signed by June 1. Elementary school students in Nanjing Laifeng Street wrote to the "Xinhua Daily" saying, "If children all over the world sign, the imperialists will surely be frightened."
