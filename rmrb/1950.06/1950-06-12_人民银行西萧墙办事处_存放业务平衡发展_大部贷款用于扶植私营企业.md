　　People's Bank of Xixiaoqiang Office
    Balanced Development of Deposit and Loan Business
    Most Loans Used to Support Private Enterprises
    [This newspaper, Taiyuan News] The Xixiaoqiang Office of the Shanxi Provincial Branch of the People's Bank continued to absorb public and private deposits in May and provided loan support to industries and businesses beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods. Since May, prices in Taiyuan City have shifted from a downward trend to stability, and in the last ten days of the month, the market prices of various goods showed a slight increase. Sporadic transactions were active, and market prices were close to the prices of state-owned companies. Therefore, the relationship between supply and demand has entered a normal development track, and legitimate industries and businesses have already made appropriate profits. For example, a grain store borrowed 5 million yuan from the bank to buy rice and new grain in Xinzhou and sell it in Taiyuan. During one month, it turned over four times, making a profit of 185,200 yuan each time after expenses. Because the market situation has become normal, the banking business is also developing steadily. This month, a total of 1,334.29 million yuan was absorbed in deposits, and 1,300.44 million yuan was withdrawn, with a month-end balance of 33.215 million yuan. In terms of lending, a total of 998.83 million yuan was issued this month, and 1,100.954 million yuan was recovered, with a balance of 36.494 million yuan; among them, 668.83 million yuan was lent to private enterprises, and 639.54 million yuan was recovered, with a balance of 30.494 million yuan. This shows that the bank has concentrated more funds to support private enterprises.

　　人民银行西萧墙办事处
    存放业务平衡发展         
    大部贷款用于扶植私营企业
    【本报太原讯】人民银行山西省分行西萧墙办事处五月份继续吸收公私存款，并对有利于国计民生的工商业进行贷款扶植。太原市五月份以来物价已由下落趋向稳定，下旬各种物品市价且呈微升，零星交易活跃，市价与国家公司牌价已趋接近，故供求关系已转入正常发展轨道，正当工商业已经有了适当利润。如有一家粮食行从银行贷款五百万元，到忻州买米与新粮到太原出售，一个月期间，共周转四次，每次除开支外获利十八万五千二百元。就由于市场情况已趋正常，故银行业务亦在稳步发展。计本月份吸收存款十三亿三千四百二十九万元，提取一十三亿零四十四万元，月终余额三千三百二十一万五千元。放款方面，本月内共计发放九亿九千八百八十三万元，收回十一亿零九百五十四万元，余额为三亿六千四百九十四万元；其中贷给私营企业六亿六千八百八十三万元，收回六亿三千九百五十四万元，余额三亿零四百九十四万元。这就说明了该行曾集中了较多的资金扶植了私营企业。
