	A recent outbreak of infectious diseases has occurred in Daquandian District, Shangcheng County, Henan Province, with nearly half of the children in the district affected. Coughing is the most severe symptom, and some are experiencing continuous measles or chickenpox. To address this, the county convened an emergency epidemic prevention meeting on May 30th, and the county government's health staff and five Western doctors and one traditional Chinese medicine doctor from the county seat were mobilized to form a treatment team to rush to the countryside for treatment. Over 200 people have now been cured. However, the strength is weak, and many villages still have no one to provide treatment.
