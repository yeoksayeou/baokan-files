How the Liulihe Cement Plant Promoted Production Through Drama?
    Liu Jiazhen

    Like other factories, workers at the Liulihe Cement Plant enthusiastically participated in various cultural activities. They performed Yangko dances, street plays, and sang liberation songs. After watching the "Chi Ye River" performed by the cultural troupe, they performed "Chi Ye River"; after watching "The White Haired Girl", they performed "The White Haired Girl"; later, they also performed the Northeast workers' drama "Meritorious Service." These plays played a significant role in raising workers' class consciousness and helping them understand the Communist Party's policies. However, they knew that to make theatrical work directly serve production, they must closely coordinate with the actual situation in the factory and perform the deeds of the factory's own workers.

    The workers were very familiar with their own factory, and there were many subjects. After everyone's research, they agreed to first adapt the "Knife Donation" story into a drama. The story is as follows: The Liulihe Cement Plant had a total of four large mills. The gear ring of the No. 2 raw material mill had been damaged before liberation, reducing output by more than a quarter. The factory called on the workers to repair the machine and restore production. But to repair the raw material mill, there was no diamond knife. The workers were all anxious. A worker named Li Ximin suddenly remembered that when the Japanese invaders occupied Beijing, the head of a diamond knife had been broken off and had fallen into the oil pit. At that time, the workers hated the brutality of the Japanese invaders, and who would care about the knife head in the oil pit! Now, to repair their own machine, Li Ximin found the knife head covered in oil and mud. But the diamond knife head was not useful, and the gear ring was only half repaired before work stopped again. At this time, a worker named Ge Ming actually took out a diamond knife and donated it to the factory. He had hidden this knife when the Japanese were drunk. Soon, the gear ring was repaired, and the No. 2 raw material mill, which had been shut down for a long time, started running again.

    After the performance of "Knife Donation," the workers launched a climax of donating tools, and production enthusiasm was also improved. Worker Li Ming donated three drill bits that he had hidden during the enemy puppet era to the factory. Wang Chaochen and Wang Yatian donated lead and iron plates. Donations of iron rollers and steel balls came one after another. Ge Ming, who was praised, carried out production even more actively. These situations encouraged the members of the factory's leading cadres' drama troupe. Later, they also performed self-written plays such as "New Family" and "Wind Pump." The number of troupe members also expanded from the initial seven to more than seventy. Workers who participated in the troupe not only did not hinder production, but also became more active and energetic in production. Because everyone wanted to strive to be written into the play.

　　琉璃河水泥厂是怎样通过戏剧推动生产的？
    刘家珍
    琉璃河水泥厂和其他的工厂一样，工友们都热狂地参加了各种文艺活动。他们扭秧歌，演街头剧，唱解放歌曲。看了文工团演的赤叶河，就演赤叶河；看了白毛女，就演白毛女；以后又演出了东北的工人剧“立功”。这些戏，对提高工人的阶级觉悟、帮助工人了解共产党的政策，起了很大的作用。可是，他们知道要使戏剧工作直接为生产服务，必须紧密地配合工厂中的实际情况，演本厂工人自己的事迹。
    工友们对自己厂子是十分熟悉的，题材很多，大家研究的结果，同意先把“献刀”故事编成戏剧。事情是这样的：琉璃河水泥厂一共有四座大磨，第二号生料磨的牙轮在解放前就坏了，使产量减少了四分之一以上。厂方号召工友修理机器，恢复生产。但要修生料磨，没有金刚刀。工友们都干着急。有位名叫李锡民的工友忽然记起，还是在日寇侵占北京的时候，有一把金刚刀的刀头折断了，掉在油坑里。那个时候，工友们愤恨日寇的残暴，谁还去管油坑里的刀头！现在，要修理自己的机器了，李锡民把那把染满油泥的刀头找了出来。但金刚刀的刀头不顶用，牙轮只修理了一半，就又停了工。这时，一位名叫葛明的工友竟拿出一把金刚刀来，献给工厂。这把刀是当年他在日本人喝醉了酒时，要去藏起来的。很快，牙轮修好，停工很久的二号生料磨又转动起来了。
    “献刀”演出后，工友们掀起了献工具的高潮，生产情绪也提高了。工友李明把在敌伪时代藏下的三个钻头献给工厂了。王朝臣、王雅田献出了铅铁板。献铁滚的，献钢珠的，接二连三。被表扬了的葛明，更积极地进行生产。这些情形鼓舞了该厂领导干部剧团的团员们。以后他们又演出了自己编写的“新家庭”、“风泵”等戏。剧团团员也由开始的七人扩展到七十多人。参加剧团的工友，不但没有妨碍生产，而且生产起来更积极起劲。因为大家都想争取自己能被编进戏里。
