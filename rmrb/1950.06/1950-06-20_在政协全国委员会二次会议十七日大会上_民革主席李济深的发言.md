　　Speech by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, at the 17th Plenary Session of the Second Session of the CPPCC National Committee
    Chairman, members, and gentlemen,

    After listening to the reports by the leaders of the Central People's Government on land reform, finance and economics, politics, military affairs, culture and education, and court work, we are very excited. Since the First Plenary Session of the CPPCC last year, the Central People's Government has been dedicated to the realization of the Common Program, and has achieved great accomplishments in military, political, diplomatic, and economic work.

    Militarily, the People's Liberation Army, through land and sea operations, has liberated all the national territory except for Tibet, Taiwan, and a few other islands, shattered the enemy's naval and air blockade, and eliminated the harassment of bandits and secret agents. Diplomatically, it has established friendly diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries, concluded the alliance, friendship, and mutual assistance treaty between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, strengthened the international people's democratic camp, and fortified the world's bastion of peace and democracy. In financial and economic work, it has stabilized the prices that have been fluctuating for more than a decade, brought the state's financial revenue and expenditure close to balance, unified the management of national financial and economic work, ensured the regulation and supply of materials, and overcome the famine that was once considered invincible. Such great achievements in governance in a short period of time can be said to be an unprecedented miracle in Chinese history. In particular, the arduous task of land reform is being vigorously promoted by the Central People's Government under the principles of grasping the principles, combining with production, and advancing steadily. At present, land reform has been completed in areas with approximately 145 million agricultural population in China, and in areas with approximately 100 million agricultural population, land reform will also be completed this winter, and it is prepared to basically complete the national land reform within two and a half to three years. As long as we can complete this most basic historical task in the revolution within two or three years, we will have favorable conditions for restoring and developing production, and the New Democratic construction will have a guarantee of victory.

    Due to the rapid development of military victories, the expansion of new areas, the insufficient number of cadres and the lack of experience, and the necessity of employing a considerable number of old civil servants, some deviations inevitably occur in grain requisition and taxation in some areas. This is an unavoidable phenomenon in the great historical changes. However, both the central and local people's governments can pay attention to correcting them. At the same time, when the government is vigorously promoting stabilizing prices, balancing revenue and expenditure, and unifying national financial and economic work, a few industrial and commercial enterprises inevitably feel some difficulties, but these difficulties are unavoidable difficulties in the process of the country's financial and economic development towards sound development, as Chairman Mao pointed out, they are difficulties in victory, they are temporary difficulties, and the Central People's Government has the confidence and the means to overcome these difficulties, and is making every effort to overcome these difficulties.

    I would like to respectfully inform the compatriots in the new areas: The existence of the feudal and semi-feudal land ownership system hinders the progress of the people's China towards industrialization and modernization. Our Central People's Government and every participating unit of the People's Democratic United Front are determined to complete the historical task of land reform. If any deviations occur in the implementation of policies by governments at all levels, we will immediately correct them based on factual investigation and research; if anyone deliberately obstructs or outwardly complies but secretly violates the land reform laws, we will ruthlessly suppress and punish them!

    I would also like to respectfully inform the urban industrialists and businessmen: Adjusting public and private enterprises and implementing the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital is the key task that the Central People's Government is focusing on after price stabilization. The government will do its best to protect or assist all industrial and commercial enterprises that serve our country and people instead of serving imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital. However, those so-called industrialists and businessmen who do not abide by government laws and regulations and still engage in speculation, disrupt finance, disrupt the market, and poison society will also be punished as they deserve!

    After hearing Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the land reform issue and the proposal of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China (Draft), I feel that this is precisely in line with the demands of the people of the whole country. The measures proposed by Vice Premier Chen Yun and Minister Bo Yibo in their reports, such as adjusting industry and commerce, adjusting taxation, streamlining and saving, and reducing the people's burden, are also in line with the demands of the people of the whole country. In terms of diplomacy, we unconditionally support Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the progress of implementing the foreign policy stipulated in Chapter 7 of the Common Program over the past eight months. On behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, I would like to suggest to the plenary session to accept the reports on finance and economics, diplomacy, and land reform, and suggest that the government adopt and implement them. On behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, I express my heartfelt gratitude and love to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for their correct leadership, and call on all comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to fight to the end for the realization of the resolutions of the plenary session.

　　在政协全国委员会二次会议十七日大会上
    民革主席李济深的发言
    【新华社十九日讯】中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议十七日的大会上的发言，全文如下：
    主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    听了中央人民政府各位首长关于土改、财经、政治、军事、文教、法院工作的报告，我们非常兴奋。自去年人民政协第一届全体会议以来，中央人民政府致力于共同纲领之实现，在军事、政治、外交、财经等工作上，都获得了巨大的成就。
    在军事上，人民解放军经过大陆和海洋上的作战，解放了除西藏、台湾及其他少数岛屿外的全部国土，粉碎了敌人的海空封锁，肃清了土匪特务的骚扰；在外交上，建立了与苏联和新民主主义国家的友好外交关系，缔结了中苏两大国家的同盟友好互助条约，壮大了国际人民民主阵营，强固了世界和平民主堡垒；在财经工作上，稳定了十数年来波动不息的物价，使国家财政收支接近平衡，统一了国家财经工作的管理，保证了物资的调节供应，战胜了一向认为不可战胜的灾荒，在短期内有了这样巨大的施政成绩，可以说是中国历史上空前未有的奇迹。尤其是土地改革的艰巨工作，中央人民政府在掌握原则、结合生产、稳步前进的方针之下大力推行。现在，全中国已约有农业人口一亿四千五百万的地区，完成了土改，约有一亿农业人口的地区，亦将在今年冬季完成土改，并准备在两年半到三年之内，基本上完成全国的土地改革，只要我们在两三年内，能够完成了这个革命中最基本的历史任务，我们就有了恢复和发展生产的有利条件，新民主主义建设就有了胜利的保证。
    由于军事胜利的急速的发展，新区的扩大，干部不够支配和缺乏经验以及不得不任用相当数量的旧公务人员，征粮征税在某些地区，不免发生若干偏差，这是历史大变革中，不可避免的现象。但中央和地方人民政府都能注意加以纠正。同时，在政府大力推行稳定物价，平衡收支，统一国家财经工作之际，亦有少数工商业不免感受若干困难，但这些困难是国家财政经济走向健全发展过程中不可避免的困难，正如毛主席所指示，是胜利中的困难，是暂时的困难，中央人民政府是有信心，有办法去克服这些困难，而且正以全力克服这些困难的。
    我愿在这里敬告新区的同胞们：封建半封建土地所有制的存在，障碍了人民的中国走上工业化现代化的前程，我们中央人民政府和人民民主统一战线的每一参加单位，都以最大的决心，来完成土地改革这一历史任务。各级人民政府在政策执行中如有发生偏差，我们当根据事实的调查研究，立即加以纠正；如有立意阻挠或阳奉阴违反抗土改法令者，我们亦毫不留情地加以镇压惩处！
    我又愿在这里敬告城市的工商业者们：调整公私企业，实现公私兼顾、劳资两利政策，是中央人民政府在物价稳定后正以全力推行的重点工作。凡非为帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本服务而为我们国家和人民服务的工商企业，政府都将尽力加以保障或扶助。但不遵行政府法令，仍肆其投机倒把、破坏金融、扰乱市场、流毒社会的所谓工商业者，亦必予以应得之惩处！
    听到刘少奇副主席关于土地改革问题的报告，以及中华人民共和国土地改革法草案的提出，觉得这正是适合全国人民的要求的。陈云副总理薄一波部长报告中提出的调整工商业，调整税收，精简节约，减轻人民负担等等办法，也是适合全国人民的要求的。在外交方面，周恩来总理所报告的关于这八个月来执行共同纲领第七章所规定的外交政策的经过，我们是无条件的拥护的。我谨代表中国国民党革命委员会向全会建议，接受财经、外交、及土地改革等各方面的报告，建议政府，采择实行。我更代表中国国民党革命委员会，对于毛主席及中共中央的正确领导，表示衷心的感谢与爱戴，并号召中国国民党革命委员会全体同志为全会决议的实现而奋斗到底。
