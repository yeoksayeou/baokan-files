　　World Knowledge After Moving Publication to Beijing
    Ding Xu
    "World Knowledge" is an international affairs and diplomatic knowledge publication with a long history. Here, as a loyal reader of over ten years, I will briefly introduce and critique this magazine, and take this opportunity to offer my opinions and hopes.
    "World Knowledge" magazine has been published for more than fifteen years. These fifteen years have been the most transformative. Because it adhered to a revolutionary stance, it suffered various persecutions under the Kuomintang reactionary rule, even to the point of being shut down. From May 1st of this year, "World Knowledge" moved its publication from Shanghai to Beijing for the convenience of work and objective needs. The "World Knowledge" after moving to Beijing has published eight issues. These eight issues, from content to form, from editorials to fillers, give people a completely new feeling. I feel that it is exploring and improving issue by issue, although there are still many shortcomings that have not been overcome.
    In terms of content, the most notable change is the addition of editorials. I think the fighting spirit of "World Knowledge" editorials is very strong. In recent issues, it has criticized Britain's two-faced diplomacy, exposed the puppet show in Baguio, and for several consecutive issues, it has severely condemned the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' persecution of the Japanese people and their conspiracy to turn Japan into a colony and military base. Reading the editorials of "World Knowledge" not only helps to understand some of the most important international issues, but also to understand the attitude we should hold towards these issues. Recently, Xinhua News Agency dispatches have also often introduced the editorials of "World Knowledge." Moreover, the Central People's Broadcasting Station introduces it almost every issue. It can be seen that the editorials of "World Knowledge" have gained very widespread attention.
    In addition to the newly added editorials, the weight of other special articles seems to be increasing issue by issue. The era when Britain and the United States were the center of international politics is gone forever. Now the center of international politics is on the side of the peace and democracy camp. Therefore, "World Knowledge" should indeed serve readers in this regard: that is, to cooperate with government policies and calls, and to introduce more internationalist ideas.
    In other aspects, in addition to maintaining the "Lookout" column, "World Knowledge" has also added the "International Notes" and "International Questions and Answers" columns. These two columns seem to be very popular among young readers. In the library of a school where I work, I saw students often buried in reading these two columns.
    In general, the content of "World Knowledge" is becoming more and more substantial issue by issue. But there are still some shortcomings.
    First of all, "World Knowledge" has consistently taken popularization as one of its editorial policies. But I always feel that it has not done enough in terms of popularization. I think some young readers have this feeling even more. "Don't estimate the readers' level as high as experts" should be the motto of the editors. Of course, "World Knowledge" has also published many simple and profound works in the past, analyzing problems in a simple and touching tone. For example, the early "Lookout" column of "World Knowledge" and Mr. Tao Fen's "Travel Notes" were very popular among readers and had a great impact.
    "World Knowledge" used to publish many satirical cartoons, which aroused great interest among readers. However, after moving to Beijing, the number of cartoons has decreased, which is a serious shortcoming. Because the power of a good cartoon is definitely not weaker than a special article. Satirical short comments are also powerful, but unfortunately they are also relatively lacking.
    The grasp of timeliness is also worse than during the Shanghai publication period. "World Knowledge" is a current affairs publication, so the faster it reflects current affairs, the better.
    Finally, in terms of planning, it seems that it should be strengthened. How to systematically introduce people's democratic countries, and how to report important international issues in a more planned way, is very important.
    In addition, I have the following three hopes: (1) Publish more common sense things to help everyone learn about international current affairs. Now, the general cadres are in urgent need of international knowledge, and "World Knowledge" should publish more articles on this type of basic knowledge. (2) Provide readers with more international news with analysis to help readers understand the international situation. Because I and several friends often feel that in order to understand the current international situation, in addition to reading the daily newspaper carefully, more and broader materials are needed. I hope that "World Knowledge" can take on the responsibility of providing this information. (3) I hope that "World Knowledge" will repeatedly analyze and explain some international questions. For example, regarding the peace signature campaign, many people do not understand what the use of signing is, and even say that signing cannot resist atomic bombs. "World Knowledge" should explain these issues more.

### 迁京出版后的世界知识

　　迁京出版后的世界知识
    丁絮
    世界知识是有悠久历史的国际问题和外交知识刊物。这里，我以一个十余年忠实老读者的资格，简单地介绍与批评这本杂志，并趁此机会，向它提供我的意见和希望。
    世界知识杂志创刊已十五年多了。这十五年，正是变化最多的十五年。由于它坚持革命的立场的缘故，它在国民党反动统治下，曾经受过种种迫害以至于最后被封闭。从今年五月一日起，世界知识为了工作的便利和客观的需要，由上海迁到北京出版。迁京后的世界知识已经出版了八期。这八期，从内容到形式，从社评到补白，都令人有面目一新的感觉。我觉得它正在一期期地摸索改进中，虽然仍有很多的缺点还没有能够克服。
    就内容来说，最令人注意的是增加了社评。我觉得世界知识社评的战斗性是很坚强的。最近几期，它抨击了英国的两面外交政策，拆穿了碧瑶傀儡戏，而且连续几期痛斥美日反动派迫害日本人民、变日本为殖民地及军事基地等阴谋罪行。读了世界知识的社评，不但了解了国际间最重要的一些问题，而且了解了我们对这些问题应抱的态度。最近新华社电讯也常常介绍世界知识的社评。而且中央人民广播电台几乎每期都介绍它。可见世界知识的社评已经获得极普遍的注意了。
    除了新增的社评以外，其他专论的分量似乎也一期重似一期。过去以英美为国际政治中心的时代已经一去不复返了。现在国际政治的中心是在和平民主阵营方面。所以世界知识的确应该在这一方面为读者服务：即配合政府政策及号召，多介绍国际主义的思想。
    其他方面，世界知识除了保持了望台外，又增加了国际扎记及国际问题解答两栏。这两栏似乎很为青年读者所欢迎。我在一个我所服务的学校的图书室中，看到同学们常常埋首读这两栏。
    从总的方面来说，世界知识的内容是一期期充实起来了。但是也还有些缺点。
    首先，世界知识一贯是以大众化作为编辑方针之一的。但是我总觉得它在大众化这方面做得不够。我想一些青年读者更有这个感觉吧。不要把读者水准估计得和专家一样高，这句话应该作为编辑先生的座右铭。当然，世界知识过去也登载过很多深入浅出的作品，用通俗浅近的笔调，深刻动人地分析问题。例如世界知识初期的了望台，和韬奋先生的“萍踪寄语”，就很受读者欢迎，发生过很大的影响。
    世界知识过去常常刊载许多讽刺漫画，很引起读者的兴趣。但迁京后，漫画比较减少了，这是一个严重的缺点。因为一幅好的漫画的力量决不弱于一篇专文。讽刺性短评也同样是有力量的，可惜也比较缺少。
    对于时间性的掌握，也比在上海出版时期差了。世界知识是时事刊物，所以反映时事愈快愈好。
    最后，在计划性方面，似乎还应加强。如何有系统地介绍人民民主国家，如何更有计划地报导重要的国际问题，这是很重要的。
    此外，我还有下列三点希望：（一）多多登载常识性质的东西，帮助大家学习国际时事。现在一般干部对国际知识都很迫切需要，世界知识应该多登载这类基本知识的文章。（二）有分析地供给读者以更多的国际新闻，帮助读者了解国际大势。因为我以及几个朋友们常常觉得，要了解目前国际形势，除了细看日报之外，还需要更多更广泛的材料。希望世界知识能负起这个提供资料的责任。（三）希望世界知识对于一些国际问题的疑问，反复地加以分析解释。例如对和平签名运动，有许多人不了解签名有什么用，甚至说签名怎么可以抵抗原子弹。这些问题，世界知识应多加说明。
