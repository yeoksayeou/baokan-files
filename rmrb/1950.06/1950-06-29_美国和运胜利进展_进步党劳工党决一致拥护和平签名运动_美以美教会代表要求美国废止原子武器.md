　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 28th: TASS reports: Newspaper sources: When Acheson delivered a speech at Harvard University on the 22nd, he was met with a demonstration organized by the Massachusetts Committee for Peace Action. Demonstrators held signs that read: "The people need peace, declare the atomic bomb illegal, Acheson - give us jobs, not bombs!"
　　Newspaper reports indicate that the Peace Declaration signature campaign is developing victoriously throughout the United States. Students at the University of Wisconsin collected 3,000 signatures in one day.
　　The recently held Minnesota Progressive Party Congress decided to establish a special peace committee, headed by Judge Tawney, to conduct a peace signature campaign throughout the state. The conference passed a resolution stating that the peace movement will be the central issue of all Progressive Party activities.
　　Seven hundred delegates attending the Northwest Pacific Conference of the Methodist Church in Great Koma, Washington, on the 21st unanimously passed a resolution calling on the United States and all other governments to declare atomic weapons illegal.
　　American Labor Party Congressman Marcantonio signed the Stockholm Declaration on the 21st, becoming the first member of the United States Congress to sign it. He announced that the American Labor Party unanimously supports the movement to collect signatures for the Peace Declaration.
　　American reactionaries are using all sorts of familiar, despicable means to try to undermine the growing organized peace movement in the United States. On the 21st, the House Un-American Activities Committee suddenly summoned Sharer, the leader of the New York Labor Peace Conference, allegedly to question him about the committee's "investigation" of "passport-forging gangsters." Sharer refused to answer this provocative questioning by the committee and declared that the committee's subpoena of him was an attack on the growing peace forces in the United States.

    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：报纸消息：当艾奇逊于二十二日去哈佛大学发表演说时，遇到了马萨诸塞州争取和平行动委员会所组织的示威游行。示威者举着标语牌，上面写着：“人民需要和平，宣布原子弹非法，艾奇逊——给我们工作，不要炸弹！”
    报纸消息显示和平宣言签名运动正在全美国各地胜利发展中。威斯康星大学的学生们，一天内便征集了三千人签名。
    最近举行的明尼苏达州进步党大会，决定设立和平特别委员会，以法官陶吞为首，在全州进行和平签名运动。大会通过决议案，指出和平运动将是一切进步党活动的中心问题。
    出席华盛顿州大科马美以美教会西北太平洋会议年会的七百名代表，于二十一日一致通过决议，要求美国和所有其他政府宣布原子武器为非法。
    美国劳工党议员马肯托尼奥于二十一日在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，他是第一个签名的美国国会议员。他宣布美国劳工党一致拥护征集和平宣言签名的运动。
    美国反动派使用各种惯用的卑污手段，力求破坏在美国日益发展的有组织的和平运动。二十一日，众院非美活动委员会忽然传讯纽约劳工和平会议的领袖谢勒尔，据说是为了就该委员会“调查”“伪造护照之党徒”事加以询问。谢勒尔对该委员会这种挑衅性的质询，拒绝作答，并宣称：该委员会之传讯他就是对美国日益增长的和平力量的攻击。
