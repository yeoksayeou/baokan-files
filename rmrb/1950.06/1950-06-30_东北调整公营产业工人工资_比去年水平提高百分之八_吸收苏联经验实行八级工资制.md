　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 29th. To encourage technological progress, appropriately improve workers' lives, and promote the development of production and construction in the Northeast, the Northeast People's Government has decided to adjust the current wages of public industrial workers and technical personnel. According to the instructions issued by the Northeast People's Government on June 19th, the wages of workers and technicians in the Northeast's public industries will be increased by 8% compared to the actual average wage level of last year after the adjustment. At the same time, the current multi-level (39 levels) wage system for workers will also be changed to an eight-grade wage system.

　　The implementation of the eight-grade wage system is a major reform of the Northeast's wage system. The eight-grade wage system is formulated based on the principle of "to each according to his work," absorbing the experience of the Soviet Union's wage system, and combining it with the specific conditions of the Northeast. Its advantages are mainly that there are fewer levels and the distance between levels is larger, the technical standards that each level of worker should possess are easier to clearly define; the higher the level, the greater the remuneration; thus, it can encourage and stimulate workers to work actively and strive to improve their skills. At the same time, the implementation of this system also provides favorable conditions for promoting piece-rate wages and bonus for exceeding quotas.

　　The current multi-level time-based wage system based on material objects implemented in the Northeast played a certain role in ensuring the minimum living standards of employees and supporting the War of Liberation in the past when production was not yet normal and prices were not very stable. However, this system is no longer suitable for the normal situation where economic construction is on the right track. In order to correctly implement the reform of the eight-grade wage system, the Northeast People's Government instructed the Northeast People's Economic Planning Commission to convene a salary conference last month to discuss the specific steps and methods for implementing this reform.

　　东北调整公营产业工人工资
    比去年水平提高百分之八
    吸收苏联经验实行八级工资制
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】为鼓励技术进步，适当改善工人生活，以促进东北生产建设的发展，东北人民政府决定对公营产业工人、技术人员的现行工资进行调整。根据六月十九日东北人民政府发布的指示规定，东北公营产业工人技术人员的工资在调整后将比去年实际平均工资的水平提高百分之八。同时，在工人中现行的多等级（三十九级）的工资制度，亦将改为八级工资制。
    实行八级工资制，是东北工资制度的一项重大改革。八级工资制度是根据“按劳取酬”原则，吸收苏联工薪工作经验并与东北具体情况相结合而制订的。其优点主要是等级少而等级之间距离较大，每级工人应具备的技术标准易于明确规定；等级愈高所得报酬愈大；因而可以鼓励和刺激工人积极劳动，努力提高技术。同时，这一制度的实行，也为推行计件工资和超额奖励提供了有利条件。
    目前东北所实行的以实物为基础的多等级的计时工资制，在过去生产还不正常、物价不很稳定的情况下，对保证战时职工最低生活和支援解放战争，曾起了一定作用。但是，现在这一制度已不能适应经济建设走上轨道的正常局面。东北人民政府为了正确推行八级工资制这一改革，曾责成东北人民经济计划委员会于上月召开了工薪会议，商讨执行这一改革的具体步骤和方法。
