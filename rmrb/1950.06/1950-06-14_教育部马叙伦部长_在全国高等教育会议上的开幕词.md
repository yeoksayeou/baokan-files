　　Opening Address at the National Higher Education Conference
　　[Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government recently published Minister Ma Xulun's opening address at the First National Higher Education Conference on June 1st. The full text is as follows:

　　Fellow Delegates, Comrades:

　　The first National Higher Education Conference of the People's Republic of China opens today. This is a major event in the construction of New China and is very exciting. The Chinese people's great revolution has been victorious, our people's democratic government has laid a solid foundation, and our country is about to fully transition to the path of New Democratic construction. It is precisely because of these conditions that we are able to convene this National Higher Education Conference today to discuss and deploy the work of higher education in New China. Of course, our People's Liberation War has not yet completely ended, Taiwan and Tibet are still awaiting advancement, and the people of the whole country still need to make the greatest efforts to support and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to complete this glorious and important task. Moreover, after a long period of war and profound social changes, the financial and economic situation cannot but encounter many serious difficulties. Therefore, the construction of the whole country cannot be fully launched at present. However, in the near future, after we have thoroughly and cleanly eliminated the remnant forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Kuomintang and overcome natural disasters and economic difficulties, our country will enter a stage of comprehensive construction. We will urgently need a large number of talents to engage in economic, national defense, and cultural construction. This situation has already begun to appear in the Northeast and will inevitably appear throughout the country soon. Therefore, it is entirely necessary for us to study, strengthen, adjust, and improve higher education in a timely manner in accordance with the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　Now, let me first talk about the current situation of higher education in China. According to existing materials, today, excluding Taiwan, there are 227 institutions of higher learning in the country (excluding schools of the nature of People's Revolutionary Universities in various places and military and political universities in various places), with a total of approximately 134,000 students. Among them, there are 138 public schools, accounting for approximately 61% of the total number of institutions of higher learning in the country; 65 private schools founded by Chinese individuals, accounting for approximately 29% of the total; and 24 schools established by churches, accounting for approximately 10% of the total. Among the institutions of higher learning in the country, there are 65 universities, accounting for 29% of the total number of institutions of higher learning; 92 specialized colleges, accounting for 40% of the total; and 70 vocational schools, accounting for 31% of the total. At present, the distribution of institutions of higher learning in the country is extremely uneven. For example, in East China alone, there are 85 institutions of higher learning, accounting for 37.4% of the total. Shanghai alone has 43 institutions, accounting for almost one-fifth of the total number of institutions of higher learning in the country. From the perspective of our country's needs, the number of institutions of higher learning in the country is still very small, and especially the quality is not high, far from meeting the requirements of various construction tasks. Approximately 15% of the institutions of higher learning in the country were established in the old liberated areas or have undergone thorough transformation. These schools have trained thousands upon thousands of revolutionary and construction cadres. Their teaching content and methods generally meet the actual needs. The combination of theory and practice is relatively good. However, most of them still maintain the nature of short-term training classes today (which is still necessary at present) and have not yet fully developed into regular institutions of higher learning. As for the original institutions of higher learning in the newly liberated areas, which account for approximately 85% of the total number of institutions of higher learning in the country, they have also trained many useful talents in the past, and many of them have made considerable contributions to the democratic movement. But this does not mean that these schools no longer need to be transformed. Their teaching content basically cannot meet the needs of national construction, their teaching methods generally still have the shortcoming of separating theory from practice, and the proportion of workers and peasants among the students is extremely small. All of these are inconsistent with the current situation and needs of our country. All these shortcomings of institutions of higher learning in the newly liberated areas are inevitable phenomena produced by the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China and need to be overcome through long-term efforts.

　　Since the birth of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the Central People's Government, the institutions of higher learning in the original old liberated areas have gradually been moving towards regularization. The institutions of higher learning in the newly liberated areas have also initially implemented reforms in school administration and curriculum, especially revolutionary political education. With the active efforts of all teachers and students, they have made good achievements and laid the foundation for continued improvement in the future.

　　The above is the basic situation of higher education in China at present. Based on the overall situation of our country and the situation of higher education, what should be the guiding principles for higher education in our New China in the future? What tasks should our institutions of higher learning across the country undertake?

　　Articles 41 to 47 of the Common Program should be the starting point for us to answer these questions. According to the Common Program, the purpose of our institutions of higher learning should be to cultivate advanced construction talents with a high level of culture, mastering the achievements of modern science and technology, and wholeheartedly serving the people, through educational methods that combine theory and practice. In order to achieve this goal, our institutions of higher learning must carry out revolutionary political education, eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies, develop the idea of serving the people, closely connect with reality in coordination with the needs of industrial, agricultural, and national defense construction, and conduct teaching work on scientific theory and technology; they must use scientific viewpoints and methods to conduct research work on history, economics, politics, and international affairs, as well as on philosophy, literature, and art; they must strive to widely and deeply popularize scientific and technological knowledge among the people, improve the people's cultural and scientific level, and promote the comprehensive construction of the country.

　　In order to accomplish the above tasks, we propose the following points as guiding principles for consolidating and strengthening higher education in the future:

　　First, and most importantly, our higher education must closely coordinate with the needs of national economic, political, cultural, and national defense construction, and first and foremost serve economic construction, because economic construction is the foundation of the entire national construction. Since our institutions of higher learning aim to cultivate advanced construction talents, systematic and practical scientific and theoretical education must be conducted in our institutions of higher learning, and specialized scientific and technological education must be implemented on this basis. It is not acceptable for institutions of higher learning to lack systematic scientific knowledge education; at the same time, this theoretical education must never repeat the mistakes of the past so-called "academic pursuits for the sake of academic pursuits," ignoring the needs of the people and the country. Our institutions of higher learning should adhere to the principle of combining theory and practice, combine basic scientific knowledge with specialized technical knowledge, integrate theoretical learning with practical training, and cultivate well-rounded, truly talented, and insightful specialized talents with analytical and creative abilities.

　　Therefore, we must plan, step-by-step, and cautiously carry out curriculum reform on the existing basis throughout the country. The basic principle of this curriculum reform is to strive for consistency between theory and practice, and to strive for curriculum content that meets the needs of national construction. On the one hand, we must overcome the long-standing tradition of dogmatism that is divorced from reality in the old schools. On the other hand, we must prevent narrow pragmatism that disregards long-term interests and overall interests and belittles theoretical learning. This reform must be planned and step-by-step, and it must be cautious, because it is a very complex and meticulous task. It is difficult to carry it out satisfactorily without sufficient ideological and human resource preparation, and our preparation in both of these aspects is currently insufficient. We must rely on the collective wisdom and efforts of all higher education workers under unified leadership, and make separate efforts according to the degree of maturity of the conditions for reform in each school, department, and even each course, in order to gradually achieve common goals. At this National Higher Education Conference, many experts and professors are prepared to propose a series of curriculum reform drafts that have been researched and discussed for several months, and to provide some experiences in curriculum reform from some schools. We hope that everyone will carefully discuss and study them, and give them supplements and revisions, but they will not be used as decisions of the conference. They will only serve as a reference for institutions of higher learning across the country to formulate new curriculum plans on their own in accordance with the above principles. After a considerable period of discussion and research, each institution of higher learning should formulate a plan that may be tried out in the next academic year during the summer vacation and submit it to the Central Ministry of Education for examination and approval.

　　Our higher education must serve economic construction and other construction projects. The second important task is to strengthen the educational facilities of the Renmin University of China and other new types of institutions of higher learning, establish various vocational schools, and add necessary departments and establish specialized courses or training classes that meet actual needs in various universities and colleges in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and various business departments according to the actual needs of various construction projects.

　　Second, our institutions of higher learning should prepare and start opening their doors to workers and peasants from now on, so as to train a large number of intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds for our country in a timely manner. As everyone knows, it is a very important task of education in New China for us to train scientific and technical experts from worker and peasant backgrounds for the construction of New China as new and strong backbones. Under this policy, some of our institutions of higher learning should immediately make various preparations, set up worker-peasant accelerated middle schools affiliated with their own schools as preparatory classes for entering institutions of higher learning; at the same time, they should start paying attention to recruiting worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant youths who meet the admission requirements to study in their own schools, and provide them with various necessary assistance and care after they enter the school. All of us who are engaged in higher education should regard educating worker-peasant youth and worker-peasant cadres as our glorious duty and should work hard to overcome the incorrect idea of ​​underestimating workers and peasants and being divorced from workers and peasants.

　　Third, our higher education should gradually become planned as national construction gradually gets on track. China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country in the past. The disunity of the economy and politics was reflected in the extreme state of anarchy in higher education. Each was self-reliant and acted independently. Now that the New China has a strong political and economic unity, our education work should be based on this foundation and gradually make planned arrangements and developments under a unified policy.

　　First of all, we must gradually realize unified and centralized leadership. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government should be responsible for leading all public institutions of higher learning in the country in terms of policies, systems, establishment plans, appointment and removal of responsible persons, curriculum materials, and teaching methods. Comprehensive universities and normal universities and normal colleges are directly managed by the Central Ministry of Education; some of the independent colleges and vocational schools are still directly managed by the Central Ministry of Education. Another part is handled by the relevant departments of the Central Government, and the candidates for the principal, policies, academic system, curriculum, etc. are still determined by the Central Ministry of Education; the funds, equipment, and other daily administrative affairs are managed by the relevant departments. As for private and church-run private institutions of higher learning, they must also abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government and implement the New Democratic education policy. Our People's Government has the responsibility to guide these private institutions of higher learning to more smoothly embark on the right track of New Democratic construction and serve the cultivation of construction talents for New China. At the current stage, the Central Ministry of Education temporarily entrusts the Education Departments or Cultural and Education Departments of major administrative regions to lead the institutions of higher learning in major administrative regions due to insufficient objective and subjective conditions. As necessary and possible, the Central Government will gradually implement direct management of institutions of higher learning across the country.

　　Secondly, under a unified policy, we must initially adjust public and private institutions of higher learning or some of their departments across the country as necessary and possible, so as to better coordinate with the needs of national construction. We will adopt a policy of actively maintaining and gradually transforming all private institutions of higher learning, except for those that perform too poorly, and we must provide possible subsidies to those departments that perform well but have economic difficulties.

　　Finally, we must transform and train teachers in institutions of higher learning and edit textbooks for institutions of higher learning in a planned and step-by-step manner. As everyone knows, teachers are the key to transforming and strengthening higher education. Since the liberation of various places, the majority of teachers have actively demanded progress and earnestly participated in learning, especially enthusiastically participating in political learning. This is a new atmosphere in our educational construction and is extremely exciting. The ancients said: "Only after learning do you know your shortcomings, and only after teaching do you know your difficulties. Knowing your shortcomings, then you can reflect on yourself; knowing your difficulties, then you can strengthen yourself. Therefore, it is said that teaching and learning promote each other." Marx also said: "Educators themselves must be educated." Our teachers today are carrying forward this spirit, bravely advancing, striving for self-improvement, so that our higher education reform is full of bright hope. In order to solve the difficulties of insufficient quantity and low quality of teachers, we must take various steps to strengthen the political and professional learning of teachers, such as establishing and strengthening teaching research and guidance groups in each school to improve the efficiency of teaching and research; strengthening the connection between institutions of higher learning and the Academy of Sciences and various production departments, conducting research work in an organized and planned manner, consolidating and strengthening the organization of research departments and research institutes in existing institutions of higher learning, so that these research institutions become the main places for cultivating teachers for institutions of higher learning in New China. At the same time, we must also plan to send intellectuals with considerable work experience and academic foundation to study abroad, in order to effectively and deeply absorb the construction experience of foreign countries, especially the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and cultivate some of our senior teachers.

　　After the curriculum problem is initially resolved, we must plan to start editing textbooks and reference books for institutions of higher learning. We should translate a large number of textbooks from Soviet institutions of higher learning as our main reference materials, and at the same time, we should start editing some textbooks. At this conference, we hope to be able to organize a textbook review committee for institutions of higher learning to be responsible for leading and organizing experts from all over the country to engage in this arduous undertaking.

　　Fellow Delegates, Comrades, what has been said above are our preliminary opinions on the guiding principles, tasks, and some important steps for higher education in the future. Now they are put forward for your reference during discussions. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, thanks to the hard work of comrades in various places, our higher education has made remarkable achievements both in creating new aspects and in transforming old aspects. This proves that our higher education in New China will inevitably move towards a bright future. Of course, we still have many difficulties at present, especially financial difficulties, which make it difficult for us to make large-scale recovery and development for a while, and even difficult to maintain the status quo in some areas. But these difficulties are unavoidable after a long war and are only temporary. They will be overcome as the economy recovers and develops. All our other difficulties and obstacles will surely be overcome and eliminated under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, thanks to the active efforts of all our comrades.

　　I wish this conference of great significance success! And I wish you all good health!

　　教育部马叙伦部长
    在全国高等教育会议上的开幕词
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府教育部顷发表该部马叙伦部长于六月一日在第一次全国高等教育会议上的开幕词。全文如下：各位代表、各位同志：
    中华人民共和国的第一次全国高等教育会议今天开幕了，这是新中国建设中的一件大事，是令人感到十分兴奋的。中国人民大革命已经胜利了，我们的人民民主政权已经奠定了坚强的基础，我们的国家即将完全转入新民主主义建设的轨道。正因为有了这些条件，我们今天才可能召开这个全国高等教育会议，来讨论和部署新中国的高等教育工作。当然，我们的人民解放战争尚未完全结束，台湾、西藏仍待进军，全国人民还需要用最大的努力来支援与配合人民解放军去完成这项光荣重大的任务，而财政经济状况在长期战争之后和深刻的社会变革之中，不能不遇到许多严重困难，因此全国的建设目前还不能百废俱举。但在不久的将来，在我们彻底干净消灭了蒋匪国民党残余力量，克服灾荒和经济困难之后，我们的国家就要转入全面的建设，我们就迫切需要大量的人才，从事经济、国防、与文化的建设工作，这种情况，在东北已经开始出现，在全国不久也必然要出现的。因此我们根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，及时地研究加强，调整和改进高等教育的问题，乃是完全必要的。
    现在让我先就中国高等教育的现况说一说。根据现有的材料，今天全国除台湾外，共有高等学校二百二十七所（各地人民革命大学一类性质的学校和各地军政大学不在内），学生共约十三万四千人，其中公立学校一三八所，约占全国高等学校总数的百分之六一，中国私人创办的私立学校六五所，约占总数的百分之二九，教会设立的学校二四所，约占总数的百分之一○；全国高等学校中，大学六五所，占高等学校总数的百分之二九，专门学院九二所，占总数的百分之四○，专科学校七○所，占总数的百分之三一。目前全国高等学校的分布是极不均衡的，如在华东区就有高等学校八五所，占总数的百分之三七·四。单单上海一地就有四十三所，几占全国高等学校总数的五分之一。从我们国家的需要来说，全国高等学校的数量还是很少，特别是质量不高，还远不能满足各项建设工作的要求。全国高等学校中约有百分之十五是创设在老解放区或者经过彻底改造的，这些学校曾经培养成千成万的革命与建设的干部，其教学的内容与方法一般地适合实际的需要；理论与实际的结合比较好；但他们在今天多半还保持短期训练班的性质（这在目前还是有必要的），尚未完全发展成为正规的高等学校。至于约占全国高等学校总数百分之八十五的新解放区原有的高等学校，它们在过去也曾培养出不少有用的人才，其中有许多人对民主运动曾作了不少的贡献，但这并不是说，这些学校已经无须改造了。它们的教学内容基本上还不能符合国家建设的需要，它们的教学方法一般地还有理论与实践脱节的缺点，同时学生中的工农成份极少，这些都与我们今天的国家的情况和需要不相称。新解放区高等学校的这一切缺点都是半殖民地半封建的旧中国所必然产生的现象，有待长期的努力来加以克服。
    自从中华人民共和国诞生，中央人民政府成立以后，原来老解放区的高等学校已在逐渐走向正规化。新解放区的高等学校也都初步实行了学校行政的改革和课程改革，特别是进行了革命的政治教育，在全体教师和同学的积极努力下，作出了良好的成绩，奠定了今后继续改进的基础。
    以上所说就是目前中国高等教育的基本情况。根据我们国家的总的情况和高等教育的情况。根据我们国家的总的政策和文教政策，今后我们新中国高等教育的方针究竟应该怎样呢？我们全国高等学校究竟应该担负些什么任务呢？
    共同纲领第四十一条至第四十七条，应该是我们解答这些问题的出发点。按照共同纲领，我们的高等学校的目的应该是以理论与实际一致的教育方法，培养具有高度文化水平，掌握现代科学技术的成就，全心全意为人民服务的高级建设人才。为要达到这个目的，我们的高等学校就要进行革命的政治教育，肃清封建的买办的法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想，就要配合着工业、农业和国防建设的需要，密切地联系实际，进行关于科学理论和技术的教学工作；就要运用科学的观点和方法进行关于历史、经济、政治和国际事务的以及关于哲学、文学艺术的研究工作；就要努力向人民群众广泛和深入地普及科学技术的知识，提高人民群众的文化科学水平，推进国家的全面建设。
    为了完成上述的任务，我们提出下列各点，作为今后整顿和加强高等教育的方针：
    第一，也是最重要的一点，我们的高等教育，必须密切地配合国家经济、政治、文化、国防建设的需要，而首先要为经济建设服务，因为经济建设乃是整个国家建设之本。我们的高等学校既然以培养高级的建设人才为目的，因此在我们的高等学校里就必须进行系统的并与实际相结合的科学理论的教育，并在此基础上，实行专门的科学技术的教育。高等学校缺乏系统的科学知识的教育是不行的；同时这种理论教育也决不能重蹈过去所谓“为学术而学术”的复辙，忽视人民和国家的需要。我们的高等学校应该根据理论与实际一致的原则，结合基本科学知识与专门技术知识，融合理论学习与业务实习，培养出全面发展的，有真才实学的，富有分析力和创造力的专门人才来。
    因此，我们要有计划有步骤地而且谨慎小心地在现有的基础上，在全国范围内进行课程改革的工作。此项课程改革工作的基本原则是力求理论与实际一致，力求课程内容适合国家建设的需要，一方面要克服旧有学校中有长期传统的脱离实际的教条主义，另一方面又要防止不顾长远利益与全面利益，轻视理论学习的狭隘的实用主义。这种改革必须是有计划有步骤的，并且必须是谨慎的，因为这是一项十分复杂十分细密的工作，没有充分的思想的准备和人力的准备就难于完满进行，而我们目前在这两方面的准备都是不充分的。我们必须按照各学校各院系乃至各门课目实行改革的条件成熟的程度，依靠全体高等教育工作者的群策群力，在统一的领导下作分头的努力，以求逐步达到共同的目标。在这一次全国高等教育会议上，许多专家教授准备提出一系列的曾经经过几个月研究和商讨的课程改革草案，和提供一些学校进行课程改革的经验，希望大家仔细讨论和研究，给以补充和修正，但是并不作为会议的决定。而只作为全国各高等学校按照上述原则自行拟订新的课程计划时的参考。各高等学校在经过相当时期的讨论研究以后，应当在暑假中作出可能在下学年试行的方案，呈报中央教育部审查批准。
    我们的高等教育要为经济建设和其他各项建设服务，第二件重要的工作就是根据各项建设实际需要，由教育部与各业务部门合作，加强中国人民大学和其他新型高等学校的教育设施，创设各种专科学校，并在各大学各学院添设必要的系和设立切合实际需要的专修科或训练班。
    第二，我们的高等学校从现在起就应该准备和开始为工农开门，以便及时地为我们的国家培养大批工农出身的知识分子。大家知道，我们为新中国的建设培养工农出身的科学技术专家，作为新的坚强的骨干，乃是新中国教育的一项十分重要的任务。在这个方针下，我们的一部分高等学校应该立即作各项准备，在自己的学校里附设工农速成中学，作为升入高等学校的预备班；同时开始注意招收具备入学条件的工农干部与工农青年，进入自己的学校学习，并在他们入校以后，加以各种必要的帮助和关顾。我们全体从事高等教育工作的同人，应该以教育工农青年与工农干部视为自己光荣的职责，应该用力克服轻视工农、脱离工农的不正确思想。
    第三，我们的高等教育应该随着国家建设的逐渐走上轨道，逐步走向计划化。中国过去是一个半殖民地半封建的国家，经济政治的不统一，反映到高等教育方面就是极端的无政府状态，各立门户，各自为政。现在新中国已经有了坚强的政治和经济的统一，我们的教育工作就应该以此为基础，在统一的方针下，逐渐作有计划的布置和开展。
    首先，我们要逐步实现统一和集中的领导。中央人民政府教育部对全国公立的高等学校，在方针、制度、设置计划，负责人任免、课程教材及教学方法等方面，都应该负有领导的责任。综合性的大学以及师范大学师范学院等均归中央教育部直接管理；独立学院和专科学校有一部分仍归中央教育部直接管理。另一部分归中央政府各有关部门办理的，其校长人选、方针、学制、课程等仍归中央教育部决定；经费、设备及其他日常行政事务方面得归有关部门管理。至于私人办的和教会办的私立高等学校，也都必须服从人民政府的法令，奉行新民主主义的教育政策。我们人民政府有责任引导这些私立高等学校更为顺利地走上新民主主义建设的正轨，为培养新中国的建设人才服务。在目前阶段，中央教育部因为客观和主观条件的不足，暂时委托各大行政区教育部或文教部领导各大行政区的高等学校，而随着必要与可能，中央将逐步地实行对全国高等学校的直接的管理。
    其次，我们要在统一的方针下，按照必要和可能，初步地调整全国公私立高等学校或其某些院系，以便更好地配合国家建设的需要。我们对私人办的私立高等学校，除办理成绩太坏者外，一律采取积极维持和逐步改造的方针，对于其中成绩优良而经济困难的院系，一定要予以可能的补助。
    最后，我们要有计划有步骤地改造与培养高等学校的师资，和编辑高等学校的教材。大家知道，教师是改造和加强高等教育的关键。各地解放后，大多数的教师积极要求进步，认真参加学习，特别是热烈参加政治学习，这是我们教育建设中的新气象，是令人极为兴奋的。古人说：“学然后知不足，教然后知困。知不足，然后能自反也；知困，然后能自强也。故曰教学相长也。”马克思也说：“教育者本身必需受教育。”我们教师今天正是发扬了这种精神，奋勇前进，自强不息，使我们高等教育的改革，充满着光明的希望。为了解决师资数量不足和质量不高的困难，我们要采取各种步骤，加强师资的政治学习与业务学习，如各校要成立和加强教学研究指导组，提高教学及研究的效能；要加强高等学校与科学院及各生产部门的联系，有组织有计划地进行研究工作，整顿和加强现有高等学校内研究部和研究所的组织，使这些研究机关成为培养新中国高等学校师资的主要场所。同时我们还要有计划地派遣具有相当工作经验及学术基础的知识分子出国学习，以期切实而深入地吸取外国尤其是苏联及东欧新民主国家建设的经验，培养我们一部分高级的师资。
    在课程问题得到初步解决之后，我们就必须有计划地着手编辑高等学校的教材和参考书。我们应该大量翻译苏联高等学校的教科书，作为我们主要的参考材料，同时我们也要着手编辑一部分教材。我们在这个会议上，希望能够组织一个高等学校教材编审委员会，负责领导和组织全国专家来从事这一艰巨的事业。
    各位代表各位同志们，以上所说的就是我们对于今后高等教育的方针、任务和若干重要步骤的初步意见，现在提出来供大家讨论时参考。自从中央人民政府成立以来，由于各地同志的艰辛努力，我们的高等教育，无论在创设新的方面和改造旧的方面，都有了显著的成绩。这就证明我们新中国的高等教育必然会走向光明灿烂的前途。当然，我们目前还有许多困难，尤其是经费的困难，使我们一时难于作大规模的恢复和发展，甚至在一部分地区还难于维持原状。但是这种困难是长期战争后不可避免的，也仅仅是暂时的，它们是会随着经济的恢复和发展而被克服的。我们的其他一切困难和阻碍，在毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导下，由于我们全体同志的积极努力，也一定能够克服和消除。
    我预祝这次具有重大意义的会议的成功！并祝各位健康！
