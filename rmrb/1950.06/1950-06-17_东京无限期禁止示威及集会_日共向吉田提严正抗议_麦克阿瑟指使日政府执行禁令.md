　　Tokyo Indefinitely Bans Demonstrations and Assemblies
    Japanese Communist Party Lodges Strong Protest with Yoshida
    MacArthur Directs Japanese Government to Enforce Ban
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] According to an AFP report from Tokyo: Japanese Communist Party Diet member Kazuyoshi Tsuchibashi, on the 15th on behalf of the Japanese Communist Party, lodged a formal protest with the Yoshida government against the Tokyo police's order indefinitely banning demonstrations and mass gatherings since June 3rd. In its protest, the Japanese Communist Party demanded: (1) the immediate cancellation of the police's order banning demonstrations and assemblies; (2) that students have the freedom to engage in political activities; and (3) the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with all Allied nations to avoid turning Japan into a foreign colony. The Yoshida government unreasonably rejected this protest from the Japanese Communist Party. At the same time, the Yoshida government also rejected the conservative Socialist Party's protest against the police ban on demonstrations and assemblies.
    State Minister in charge of Japanese police affairs, Keinzo Higai, declared on the 15th in the House of Representatives Local Administration Committee that as long as the "situation remains unstable," demonstrations and marches and assemblies will continue to be prohibited in Tokyo. Apart from the Japanese Communist Party's organ, Akahata, other conservative newspapers have not dared to comment on the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Superintendent Eiichi Tanaka's ban on demonstrations and assemblies. According to the Associated Press, before the ban was announced, Tanaka and other Japanese officials had met with the Allied Headquarters authorities, so those newspapers fear that Tanaka's actions "may have been approved by the (American) occupation authorities."

　　东京无限期禁止示威及集会
    日共向吉田提严正抗议 
    麦克阿瑟指使日政府执行禁令
    【新华社十六日讯】据法新社东京讯：日本共产党众议员土桥一吉，十五日代表日共对东京警察自六月三日起无限期地禁止示威和群众集会的命令，向吉田政府提出正式抗议。日共在抗议中要求：（一）立即取消警察禁止示威和集会的命令；（二）学生有从事政治活动的自由；（三）与所有的盟国缔结全面和约，以避免把日本变为外国的殖民地。吉田政府对于日共这一抗议，无理地加以拒绝。同时，吉田政府也拒绝了保守的社会党对警察禁止示威与集会的抗议。
    负责日本警务的国务相樋贝诠三于十五日在众院地方行政委员会上宣称：只要“情况仍未稳定”，东京市区仍将继续禁止示威游行和集会。除了日共机关报赤旗报外，其他保守报纸均未敢对东京警视总监田中英一不准举行示威游行及集会的禁令，加以评论。据美联社透露：在禁令宣布前，田中与其他日本官员曾会见盟军总部当局，因此那些报纸恐怕田中的行动“可能是得到（美国）占领当局批准的。”
