Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 13th: The People's Liberation Army Northwest Military Region and the First Field Army troops have cultivated 1.4 million mu of farmland, laying a solid foundation for completing the annual production plan. According to statistics from early May: the troops stationed throughout Xinjiang Province have reclaimed over 673,000 mu of land and sown 430,000 mu, exceeding the spring plowing production task. The Shaanxi Military Region and a certain army corps have reclaimed 560,000 mu of wasteland and have now completed sowing. Troops stationed in Qinghai, except for those carrying out bandit suppression missions, have dispatched half of their labor force to engage in agricultural production, reclaiming over 70,000 mu of wasteland and planting nearly 4,000 mu of vegetables. A unit of a certain army corps in Gansu cultivated 30,000 mu of land in the Hexi Corridor. Troops stationed in Ningxia have reclaimed wasteland along the banks of the Yellow River and planted grains; a certain army and an independent division have cultivated over 60,000 mu of land in total.

One of the significant characteristics of this year's agricultural production by the troops is the emphasis on water conservancy and irrigation. Large-scale water conservancy projects have been undertaken in various locations. This year, the water conservancy projects constructed by the Xinjiang troops can irrigate over one million mu of land, not only sufficiently supplying water for the troops' cultivation but also providing a large amount to meet the needs of the farmers. A certain regiment of the Qinghai garrison is constructing the Changsheng Canal, which is over thirty li long, on the south bank of the Huangshui River. Upon completion, it will transform over ten thousand mu of barren land in the suburbs of Xining into fertile fields. A certain unit in Gansu participating in the construction of a canal in the Hexi region can irrigate 300,000 mu of land, of which 90% of the water conservancy is available for farmers' use. A certain unit stationed in Dunhuang has completed a seven-li long canal that traverses the desert, greatly benefiting the cultivation of the local people. The Funong Canal built by a certain independent division stationed in Ningxia's Zhongwei County can irrigate 100,000 mu of land, and in addition to supplying irrigation for the 20,000 mu of farmland cultivated by the division itself, the remainder can be supplied to local farmers.

In agricultural production, all units universally emphasize intensive farming and strive for production efficiency. For example, the agricultural reclamation troops of a certain army corps stationed in Shaanxi initially reclaimed one to two fen of wasteland per person per day, but later gradually increased it to three to four fen, and universally achieved intensive farming, changing the past phenomenon of simply pursuing numbers.

Based on the different conditions of their stationed areas, the units also engage in animal husbandry, handicraft industry, transportation, fishing, and arduous construction projects in a planned manner. In order to solve some of the troops' needs, the various units of the Xinjiang Military Region are conducting or will conduct sideline production such as textile, papermaking, shoemaking, oil pressing, and tofu making, as well as salt production and gold mining. The Shaanxi garrison has established iron factories and blacksmith shops to manufacture agricultural implements. A certain army stationed in Ningxia raises over 2,300 pigs, 3,000 sheep, and over 1,000 chickens, and engages in transportation, firewood gathering, charcoal burning, fishing, mat weaving, shoemaking, gold panning, and medicinal herb gathering. A certain army in Qinghai has transferred approximately 2,000 people to form a "Mountain Gathering Team" and has invested in buying 36,000 sheep to jointly raise with residents. To participate in the construction of the Northwest, tens of thousands of troops from the First Field Army are actively engaged in earthwork construction projects on the Tianshui-Baoji and Tianshui-Lanzhou sections of the Longhai Railway. Among them, the Tianbao section has completed approximately one million cubic meters of the project, and the work efficiency exceeds one and a half times that of the contractors during the Kuomintang period. The troops stationed in Xinjiang and Qinghai are also engaged in huge road construction projects. Commanders and fighters are working tenaciously in high mountains, narrow valleys, deserts, swamps, and grasslands.

　　人民解放军是国防军也是生产军
    西北军区暨一野部队
    耕种农田百万亩
    重视水利灌溉普遍精耕细作
    天宝段工程已完成百万土石方
    【新华社西安十三日电】人民解放军西北军区和第一野战军部队，已耕种一百四十万亩农田，打下了完成全年生产计划的良好基础。根据五月初的统计：新疆全省驻军已开垦土地六十七万三千余亩，播种四十三万亩，超额完成春耕生产任务。陕西军区和某兵团已开荒五十六万亩，现已播种完毕。驻青海的部队除执行剿匪任务的以外，抽出半数劳力从事农业生产，开垦荒地七万余亩，种植菜蔬近四千亩。甘肃某兵团一部在河西走廊种地达三万亩。宁夏驻军在黄河两岸，开垦荒地，种植谷物；某军及独立某师共种地六万余亩。
    今年部队农业生产的显著特点之一，就是重视水利灌溉。各地都大规模地兴修水利工程。今年新疆部队所修建的水利工程共可灌地一百余万亩，不仅可以充分地供应部队种地的用水，还可以大量供应农民的需要。青海驻军某团正兴修湟水南岸的长三十余里的长胜渠，完工后可使西宁城郊万余亩瘠地成为良田。甘肃某部在河西参加修筑的水渠能灌田三十万亩，其中百分之九十的水利可供农民使用。驻敦煌某部已修成横贯沙漠长达七里的一条水渠，大大有利于当地人民的耕种。宁夏独立某师兴修的中卫县扶农渠，可灌地十万亩，除供给该师自种的二万亩农田灌溉外，其余可供给当地农民使用。
    在农业生产中各部都普遍地重视精耕细作，讲求生产效率。如驻陕西某兵团农垦部队，开始每人每天开荒一分到二分，后来逐渐提高到三分至四分，并普遍地作到精耕细作，改变了过去单纯追求数字的现象。
    各部根据驻地的不同条件，并有计划地从事畜牧业、手工业、运输业、捕鱼业和艰巨的建筑工程。新疆军区各部为解决部队部分需要，正进行或将进行纺织、造纸、做鞋、榨油、做豆腐等副业生产及打盐、采金等生产。陕西驻军建立了铁厂、铁匠炉制造农具。驻宁夏某军养猪二千三百余口，羊三千只，鸡一千余只，并从事运输、打柴、烧炭、捕鱼、编席、做鞋、淘金、采集药材等生产。青海某军抽调约近二千人组成“采山队”，并投资买羊三万六千只与居民合伙牧养。为参加西北的建设，第一野战军的数万大军正积极从事陇海铁路天（水）宝（鸡）、天（水）兰（州）段的土石方建设工程。其中天宝段已完成约一百万立方公尺的工程，工作效率超过国民党时期包工的一倍半。新疆、青海驻军也都正从事巨大的修建公路的工程。指战员们正在高山狭谷沙漠泥沼和草原地带顽强地工作着。
