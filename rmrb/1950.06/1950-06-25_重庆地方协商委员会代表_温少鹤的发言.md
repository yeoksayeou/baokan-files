Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: Speech by Wen Shaohe, representative of the Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 22nd, in full:

    Chairman, fellow committee members, esteemed colleagues:

    I, Shaohe, am extremely excited to be here in Beijing as a representative dispatched by the Chongqing Municipal Consultative Committee to attend this conference. The last time the CPPCC convened, Chongqing and even the southwestern provinces had not yet been liberated. This plenary session is being held after the basic liberation of all parts of the country, with only Tibet and Taiwan yet to be liberated in the foreseeable future. Therefore, this meeting is particularly significant. In my excitement, I would like to briefly report on the situation in Chongqing after liberation, along with my observations, for your consideration.

    Chongqing was liberated on November 30, 1949. Because the People's Liberation Army implemented its entry policy upon entering the city, it first maintained local order and prevented sabotage by bandits and secret agents, so the city remained peaceful and as usual. Once the general public came into contact with the People's Liberation Army, they were happy to be close to them, which was an unprecedented phenomenon. The Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government were successively established, and they first convened forums with representatives from all walks of life to establish a consensus on supporting and implementing the New Democracy and the Common Program of the CPPCC and to universally launch various forms of study. Subsequently, in late February of this year, the first session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles was held to convey the main policies of the Central People's Government and to understand the actual situation in all aspects. Then the Consultative Committee was established, and it held several meetings to resolve a number of issues. In mid-June, it was decided to hold the second session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles.

    Chongqing, due to its special circumstances, has suffered unusually in the past compared to other places: firstly, because liberation came later, most of the industrial and commercial sectors, under the layers of oppression by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, were exhausted; secondly, before liberation, gold yuan notes and silver yuan notes were concentrated in Chongqing, making Chongqing the end of the line, and the economy of the general public suffered unprecedentedly severe damage; thirdly, the severe material losses caused by the September 2nd Fire in 1949 meant that Chongqing's industrial and commercial sectors, except for a very few who were lucky or had escaped early, were unable to resume their operations. However, these difficulties are, after all, individual. When we face the many difficulties of our central and local people's governments, we deeply realize that individual difficulties are included in the difficulties of the entire country and the people's government. The only way is for us to overcome the overall difficulties together. Once the difficulties of the country and the government are overcome, individual difficulties will also be overcome.

    Since the opening of the conference, I have respectfully listened to Chairman Mao's enlightening remarks, as well as the reports by various leaders on the conference affairs, land reform, economy, finance, taxation, politics, military affairs, culture and education, and the courts, and the speeches by representatives of various democratic parties. This has opened my mind and greatly benefited me. I have seen that all the measures of the Central People's Government are carefully considered in advance, gathering opinions from all sides, so they can be in line with reality and achieve the expected results. Most valuable of all, in March of this year, the central government implemented a unified financial and economic plan, which stabilized the national currency and prices. This was a major event that turned the tide. In Chongqing, which suffered the most from the disaster of currency devaluation, it feels like an unprecedented miracle. The general public believes that the government has found a solution to the currency and price issues and will be able to handle everything. This is worth writing about in detail.

    The central task of this conference is to discuss and decide on the Land Reform Law. With the concerted efforts and careful deliberations of the masses, perfect conclusions can certainly be reached. I, Shaohe, am willing to bring the Land Reform Law discussed at this conference, together with Chairman Mao's great instruction "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation" put forward at the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, along with the various gains of the conference, back to Chongqing, and convey them to the public as much as possible, so that we can all proceed together along the correct path.

    In order to seek closer ties with the localities, this conference has put forward a proposal stipulating that local consultative committees should make key reports to the conference. I, Shaohe, will follow this principle and give a summary report of the situation in Chongqing, along with my humble opinions. I hope that you will point out any inaccuracies. I respectfully wish Chairman, fellow committee members, and esteemed colleagues good health, and wish the conference a complete success.

    重庆地方协商委员会代表
    温少鹤的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】重庆市人民代表会议协商委员会代表温少鹤二十二日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言，全文如下：主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    少鹤此次由重庆市协商委员会推派来京列席大会，感觉异常兴奋。上次人民政协开会时，重庆乃至西南各省区均未解放，此次全委会议召开于全国各地基本解放之后，仅余西藏台湾地区亦在指顾解放中，所以此次会议尤显示其重要性。少鹤兴奋之余，特简单报告重庆解放后情形，并附所见，以就正于各位委员各位先生之前。
    重庆于一九四九年十一月三十日获得解放，因人民解放军于入城时实行了入城政策，首先保持地方秩序，制止匪特破坏，市面安堵如常。一般老百姓一经接触解放军，即乐于与之亲近，此为从来未有的现象。军管会与市人民政府相继成立，先就各界分别召开座谈会，对新民主主义与人民政协共同纲领，建立了一致拥护实施的基础并普遍展开种种方式的学习。随于本年二月下旬，举行第一次各界人民代表会议，传达了中央人民政府的主要政策，了解了各方面的实际情况。接着产生协商委员会，开会多次，解决若干问题。本月中旬，已决定举行第二次各界人民代表会议。
    重庆因处境特殊，过去所受不良的遭遇，异于各地：一则因解放较晚，一般工商业在帝国主义封建主义和官僚资本主义层层压榨之下，大都精血枯竭；再则在解放前金元券和银元券先后向重庆集中，使重庆成为尾闾，一般人民经济，都遭受到空前严重的损害；三则一九四九年九二火灾，物资损失的惨重，使重庆工商业，除极少数幸运或早经逃避者外，均属无法展开他本身的业务。但是这些困难毕竟是小我的，当我们正视了我们的中央与地方人民政府还有许多困难，我们便深切意识到，小我的困难包含在整个国家和人民政府的困难之中，我们要共同克服整个的困难才是办法，国家和政府的困难克服了。小我的困难也就克服了。
    大会开会以来，敬聆毛主席开示之言论，暨各首长关于会务，及土地改革、经济、财政、税收、政治、军事、文教、法院的报告，与夫各民主党派代表的发言，开启茅塞，获益甚多。窃见中央人民政府一切设施，均于事前集思广益，考虑周详，故能切合实际，收到预期效果。而最为难得者，尤在本年三月份中央实行财经统一方案，使全国币值巩固，物价稳定，这是扭转乾坤的一件大事，在受货币贬值之祸最烈的重庆地方看来，更觉得是一种空前的奇迹，一般人民，认为政府对于币值物价有了办法，对于一切事情都会有办法，这是值得大书特书的。
    此次大会的中心任务，系议定土地改革法，在大众通力合作缜密研讨之下，一定能获得完善的结论。少鹤愿将此次所议定的土地改革法，与毛主席日前在中共三中全会所提出“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”的伟大指示，连同大会种种收获，带回重庆，尽量传达于大众，共向正确的路线一致进行。
    大会为求与地方切取连系起见，此次提有方案，对各地协商会有向大会作重点报告之规定，少鹤特本此旨，将重庆情形撮要报告，并附鄙见，是否有当，尚望各位指教。敬祝主席各位委员各位先生健康。并祝大会圆满成功。
