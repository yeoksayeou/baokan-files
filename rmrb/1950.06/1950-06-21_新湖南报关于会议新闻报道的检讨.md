Title: Self-Criticism of *New Hunan Daily* Regarding Conference News Coverage

　　Recently, based on the spirit of the News Administration's "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work" and the article "On Reporting Conference News" published in *News Work* of the Beijing *People's Daily*, we examined the various conference news items published in our newspaper in the previous stage and found that there were significant shortcomings in the reporting of conference news.

　　The first shortcoming is that the amount of conference news in our newspaper is large, occupying a significant amount of space. Taking October of last year as an example, in that month alone, there were more than sixty conference news items from Hunan Province alone. If these news items were put together, they could fill six entire pages. Moreover, that month was when the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference closed, the Central People's Government was established, and the Chinese People's Conference for the Defense of World Peace was held, so there was hardly a day when the newspaper did not see conference news, and the position of various conference news items was very important, making conference news very prominent in that month's newspaper. Similar situations occurred in other months' conference news. On December 1st of that year, the newspaper simultaneously published three conference news items on the important news page: the Provincial Workers' Representative Conference, the Highway Workers' Representative Conference, and the Telecommunications Workers' Representative Conference. Allowing so many conference news items lacking life content (of course, some conference reports are necessary) to occupy many positions in our newspaper's limited space, of course, relatively reduced the number of vivid reports that could reflect the actual life and labor production of the masses, reducing the due role of the newspaper.

　　The second shortcoming is that our conference news reports often neglect the conference content that is closely related to people's lives, but use the greatest effort to report the conference process itself. The broad masses of people do not like to see such news. In October, Changsha held the first People's Representatives Conference of All Circles. This was a conference that should be reported and that the masses cared about. Although we also used a large amount of space and spent a lot of effort, because we spent our main energy on reporting the conference process, we naturally could not exert the due role of the report. Before, during, and after the meeting, we published many messages in a series with a large amount of space, but what about the content? However, it was a conference preview, a list of representatives, a list of the presidium, a list of the proposal review group, an opening ceremony, a speech by the head, a speech by the representative, a group discussion, a closing ceremony, and another long speech. The news "Changsha People's Representatives Conference of All Circles is Ready to Open After the Day" was published in the headline position of the important news page. After the opening of the conference, the newspaper continuously published the speeches of eleven participating representatives for two consecutive days with a large amount of space. At the Provincial Workers' Representative Conference held from December 1st to 5th last year, the newspaper also made continuous reports on the conference process on a daily basis, but the conference news did not clearly explain what resolutions were passed at the conference.

　　Why did such shortcomings occur? Mainly because we have a deviation in our understanding of conference news, and the purpose of reporting conference news is not clear. In the past, we often mistakenly believed that the conference itself was news, so we indiscriminately put many conference news items that the masses did not care about on the newspaper. For example, for many conferences that were not very important, we published news about the preparatory meeting before the meeting. This was completely unnecessary, because the news of this preparatory meeting was not very relevant to the people, and the masses would certainly not want to see this news. Although these news items should be reported, because we did not clearly realize that the only purpose of reporting the conference is to guide the people's work and life, a blind report was formed, focusing solely on reporting the conference from the form, filling the report with many unnecessary things, and neglecting the vivid content of the conference that has educational significance for the masses.

　　Because we ourselves did not handle conference news properly, we more or less created an impression in society that it seemed that any conference should be published as news. If the conference news of that department is not published, it means that the work of that department is not valued. We often receive many letters from various units condemning us for not publishing their conference news, or for not publishing enough or prominently enough; in addition, our own thinking is not clear, which in turn contributed to the shortcoming of our abuse of conference news. In addition, because of our superficial and unrealistic reporting of conferences, it has also increased the tendency of some units to be formalistic in holding conferences to a certain extent.

　　In order to improve our work, we believe that in the future, in addition to resolutely implementing the News Administration's "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work" in editing work, we also require all reporters and correspondents to seriously study the *People's Daily* article "On Reporting Conference News." When reporting conferences, we should be selective and report the vivid content of those conferences that are truly closely related to the lives of the majority of people, and not waste our energy on those conferences in which people have no interest, as well as unnecessary superficial forms in the conferences.

### 新湖南报关于会议新闻报道的检讨

　　新湖南报关于会议新闻报道的检讨
    最近我们根据新闻总署《关于改进报纸工作的决定》和北京人民日报《新闻工作》中所发表的《论会议新闻的报道》一文的精神，检查了本报前一阶段所刊载的各种会议新闻，发现在会议新闻报道上存在着很大的缺点。
    第一个缺点是我们报纸上的会议新闻数量很多，所占据的篇幅很大。以去年十月份为例，在那一个月当中，仅仅是湖南本省的各种会议新闻即有六十多篇，如果把这些新闻合拢在一起，可以整整拚满六个版面。而且那一个月正是人民政协闭幕，中央人民政府成立，举行中国保卫世界和平大会的时候，所以几乎没有一天的报纸看不到会议的新闻，而且各种会议新闻所占的地位又很大，使那一个月报纸上会议新闻表现得十分突出。其他各月份的会议新闻也有类似的情形，十二月一日那天的报纸，仅仅在要闻版上就同时出现全省职工代表会议，公路职工代表会议，电讯职工代表会议三篇会议新闻。让那许多缺少生活内容的（当然有的会议报道是必要的）会议消息占据着我们报纸有限篇幅的很多地位，当然就使能反映群众实际生活和劳动生产状况的生动报道的数量相对的减少，降低了报纸应有的作用。
    第二个缺点是我们的会议新闻报道，往往是忽视了那些与人民生活有密切关系的会议内容，而是用最大的力量去报道会议过程的本身，这样的新闻广大人民是不喜欢看的。十月中长沙市举行了第一届各界人民代表会议，这是应该报道，也是群众所关心的一次会议，我们虽然也用了很大篇幅，花了很大力气，但是由于我们把主要精力花费在会议过程的报道，当然就不能发挥报道应有的作用。会前、会后、以及会议进行当中，我们曾一连串用很大篇幅发布了许多消息，但是内容呢？不过是会议预告、代表名单、主席团名单、提案审查小组名单、开幕仪式、首长讲话、代表讲话、小组讨论、闭幕仪式，又是一大篇讲话。其中《长沙市各界代表会筹备就绪后日开幕》的消息是以要闻版头条地位刊载的。会议开幕后，报纸曾连续两天都用很大篇幅刊载了十一位与会代表的讲话。在去年十二月一日到五日所举行的全省职工代表会议，报纸上对会议过程也是按日作了连续报道，但是这次会议究竟通过了什么决议，会议新闻反而没有清楚的交代出来。
    为什么会发生这样的缺点呢？主要是因为我们对会议新闻的认识有偏差，对于会议新闻报道的目的不明确。过去我们往往错误的认为会议本身就是新闻，因此就不加选择的把许多群众并不关心的会议新闻搬上了报纸。譬如有许多并不十分重要的会议，我们都在开会以前就发布筹备会议的消息，这是完全不必要的，因为这种筹备会议的消息对人民并没有多大关系，群众当然也就不愿意看这种消息。这些消息虽然应该报道，但是由于我们没有明确认识到报道会议的唯一目的是为了指导人民的工作与生活，因此就形成了盲目的报道，单纯着眼从形式上去报道会议，使报道充塞着许多不必要的东西，忽视了会议中对群众有教育意义的生动内容。
    由于我们自己对会议新闻处理得不够妥当，在社会上或多或少的造成了一种印象，好像是随便什么会议都应该当作新闻来发表，如果不发表那一部门的会议消息，就表示不重视那一部门的工作。我们常常收到许多单位对我们没有发表他们的会议消息，或发表得不够多、不够显著，而谴责我们的信件；加以我们自己思想不明确，就反转来又助长了我们滥发会议新闻的缺点。此外，由于我们对会议报道的浮而不实，也在某种程度上增加了某些单位在举行会议方面的形式主义倾向。
    为了改进工作，我们认为今后除了在编辑工作上坚决贯彻新闻总署《关于改进报纸工作的决定》外，并要求各记者、通讯员，认真学习人民日报《论会议新闻的报道》一文。在报道会议时，应有所选择，报道那些真正与多数人民生活有密切关系的会议的生动内容，而不要把精力浪费在那些人民并无兴趣的会议，以及会议中不必要的表面形式上面。
