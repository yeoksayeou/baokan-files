Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 6th: Despite the illegal obstruction and suppression by MacArthur and his lackey Yoshida government of the planned general strike and class boycott by Japanese workers and students on the 3rd, as well as the People's General Uprising Rally and demonstrations, the people of Japan, under the leadership of the working class, stubbornly adopted decentralized forms and held the People's General Uprising Rally as scheduled on the 3rd.

On the eve of the 3rd, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department suddenly announced a ban on outdoor gatherings and demonstrations before the 5th. Regarding gatherings and demonstrations in areas outside of Tokyo, the National Rural Police Headquarters issued instructions to the police chiefs of each prefecture and county to "thoroughly crack down." On the 3rd, the Yoshida government mobilized 25,000 patrol police in Tokyo alone, preparing to suppress the demonstrations, and dispatched another 2,000 police officers as "demonstration alert teams," scattered around the Imperial Palace Plaza and Hibiya Park. The "Breakthrough Industrial Crisis General Uprising Rally" originally approved to be held in Hibiya Park by the All Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union, although prevented by the police from being held there, the striking automobile workers changed the venue to the Red Cross Auditorium in Shiba Park, with about 10,000 people attending. The rally opened with the singing of The Internationale. Communist Councilor Hachijiro Kazahaya, All Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee Secretary Kentaro Kaneko, and other representatives delivered speeches. The speakers called on the masses to protest the police department's ban on gatherings. Nakahara Junkichi, a representative of the Tokyo Preparatory Committee of the Democratic National Front, read out a public letter to MacArthur signed by 30 workers' organizations, demanding a swift conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and the withdrawal of the occupation forces, demanding MacArthur to give a swift and appropriate reply on the issue of early peace and Japanese national independence, and protesting the anti-democratic actions of the American occupiers. The rally passed two resolutions: (1) demanding the release of the eight innocent patriots arrested in the "May 30th People's Rally"; (2) demanding the dismissal of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Chief who undermined the people's right to freedom of assembly. The rally concluded with the singing of The Internationale.

On the same day, "General Uprising Rallies to Breakthrough the Industrial Crisis, Oppose War, and Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet" were also held in Nagoya, Mito, Maebashi, and other places. The Nagoya rally demanded the release of the eight arrested patriots and called for the expulsion of MacArthur's education advisor, Eells, from all universities and colleges in Japan. Despite the direct obstruction and suppression by the American occupation forces, the people of Osaka also took decentralized forms and held rallies in the rain.

In addition, workers at Hitachi Manufacturing, Toho Film Studio, and metalworkers all went on strike on the 3rd.

　　日本人民开总奋起大会
    抗议美国占领者的反民主行动
    要求早缔全面和约撤退占领军
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：日本工人及学生原定在三日举行的总罢工、总罢课，同时召开人民总奋起大会与举行示威游行的计划，虽然遭到了麦克阿瑟及其走狗吉田政府的非法阻挠与镇压，但是，在工人阶级的领导下，日本各地人民仍然顽强地采取分散的形式如期地于三日召开了人民总奋起大会。
    在三日的前夕，东京警察局突然宣布禁止在五日以前举行室外集会和示威游行。对东京以外各地的集会和示威游行，由国家地方警察本部向各府、县警察队长发布了“务期周到地加以取缔”的训令。三日那天，吉田政府仅在东京一地就动员了二万五千名巡逻警察，准备镇压，并另派二千名警察为“示威警戒队”，散布在皇宫广场和日比谷公园的周围。预先已申请获准在日比谷公园举行的由全日汽车产业工人工会主办的“突破产业危机总奋起大会”，虽因遭到警察的阻止而不能在该地举行，但罢工的汽车工人改在芝公园的红十字会礼堂举行了大会，到会者约达一万人。大会在高唱国际歌声中开幕，共产党参议员风早八十二、全日工会联络委员会干事金子健太及其他代表纷纷发表演说。演说者号召群众抗议警察局禁止集会的措施。民主民族战线东京筹备会代表中原淳吉在会上宣读了由三十个工人组织签字的致麦克阿瑟的公开信，要求迅速缔结全面对日和约及撤退占领军，要求麦克阿瑟对早日媾和及日本民族独立问题作迅速和适当的答复，并抗议美国占领者的反民主行动。大会并通过两项决议：（一）要求释放“五·三○人民大会”中无辜被捕的八名爱国者；（二）要求将破坏人民自由集会权利的东京警察局长撤职。大会在高唱国际歌声中闭幕。
    同日，名古屋、水户、前桥等地，也举行了“突破产业危机、反对战争、打倒吉田内阁总奋起大会”。名古屋的大会要求释放八名被捕的爱国者，并号召把麦克阿瑟的教育顾问意尔斯从日本所有的大学和专科学校中驱逐出去。大阪人民虽在美国占领军的直接阻挠与镇压下，也采取分散的形式冒雨举行大会。
    此外，日立制作所、东宝电影制片厂的工人及金属工人，均在三日举行了罢工。
