    To Rapidly Expand the Circulation of Renminbi
    Banks of Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces Strengthen Ties
    Determine Datong and Jining as Key Contact Points
    [Report from this newspaper, Zhangjiakou] To strengthen monetary and financial ties between Chahar and Suiyuan provinces, promote the use of Renminbi in rural areas, and facilitate material exchange between the two provinces, the People's Banks of the two provinces held a meeting in Zhangjiakou in mid-May to discuss relevant issues.
    This meeting was convened according to the instructions of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China. At the meeting, participants exchanged information and experiences. Yang Zesheng, Director of the Chahar Branch of the People's Bank, pointed out at the meeting: Eliminating the pricing and use of silver dollars in various places is an important task in promoting the use of the national currency in rural areas. After more than a year of strict management of gold and silver in Chahar Province, they are rarely seen in most areas. Only in a part of Yanbei area is there still activity involving silver dollars, but considerable progress has been made in bringing the national currency to the countryside. At present, Renminbi is being used in towns and villages within a hundred li of Zhangbei, seventy li of Shangdu, sixty li of Hunyuan, the eight major towns of Yuxian, and various places along the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. This shows that the capacity for monetary absorption has increased, which is very beneficial for stabilizing prices and developing production. Director Yang also pointed out that in the future, in addition to extensive publicity, cooperation with trade and other departments, and appropriately issuing loans and putting currency into circulation, currency promotion committees should be established in various places. Local governments and relevant departments should also actively cooperate in investigating and cracking down on silver dollars, mobilize the masses to refuse to use silver dollars, and gradually and systematically eliminate barter trade according to the different conditions of each region.
    Suiyuan Province began managing gold and silver, mainly the use of silver dollars, in January of this year. Since the announcement of the ban, the use of silver dollars has shifted from open to secret. Since price stabilization in March, black market activity in gold and silver has gradually decreased. Renminbi is also used within twenty li around Guisui and in larger towns.
    After reaching a consensus on future measures at the meeting, and with the consent of the financial committees of the two provinces, it was agreed that in the future, in addition to promoting with administrative power, specific contact methods would be agreed upon: exchanging relevant materials, determining Datong and Jining as key contact points, and convening monetary and financial meetings of the two provinces at any time as needed.

    为迅速扩大人民币流通范围
    察绥两省银行加强联系
    确定以大同集宁为联系重点
    【本报张家口讯】察绥两省人民银行为加强货币金融联系，推行人民币下乡，促进两省物资交流，特于五月中旬在张市举行会议，商讨有关问题。
    此次会议系根据人民银行总行指示召开，会议上互相交流了情况和经验。察省分行杨泽生行长在会上指出：肃清各地白洋计价行使是推行本币下乡的一项重要工作。察省金银经过一年多的严格管理，大部地区已很少见，只雁北一部地区仍有白洋活动，但货币下乡也已获得相当成绩。目前张北百里内，商都七十里内，浑源六十里内，蔚县八大镇，以及京绥路各地之城镇乡村都已行使了人民币。足见货币的容纳量已经增加，这对稳定物价、发展生产都是很有利的。杨行长又指出：今后除广泛宣传、结合贸易合作等部门、适当发放贷款投放货币外，各地应成立货币推行委员会。各地政府及有关部门亦应大力配合缉查白洋，并发动群众拒用白洋，同时根据各地区不同情况逐步地、有计划地消灭以物易物的交易方式。
    绥远省自今年一月份起开始管理金银，主要是白洋的行使，自布告禁止后，白洋已由公开行使转向秘密。三月份起物价稳定后，金银暗市活动已日渐减少。在归绥周围二十里内及较大城镇也都行使了人民币。
    在会上两行对今后措施取得一致意见后，经取得两省财委会同意。今后以行政力量推动配合外，并约定具体联系办法：交换有关材料，确定以大同、集宁两地为联系重点，今后并视需要随时召开两省货币金融会议。
