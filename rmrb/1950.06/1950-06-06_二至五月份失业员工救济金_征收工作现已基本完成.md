[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in implementing the "Trial Implementation Rules for the Beijing Municipality's Decision on Relief for Unemployed Workers," has basically completed the collection of unemployment relief funds over the past four months. Among factories and enterprises with ten or more employees who should pay unemployment relief funds, there are 31 state-owned enterprises. They all paid in February and March, with a payment rate of 93.6% in April and 80.6% in May. There are 23 municipal enterprises, with a payment rate of 85.7% in February, 90.9% in March, 86.9% in April, and 68.7% in May. There are 61 production units of government agencies, with a payment rate of 84.8% in February, 85.5% in March and April, and 45.9% in May. There are 373 private enterprises, with a payment rate of 96.6% in February, 94.1% in March, 69.7% in April, and 31.9% in May. As of May 27th, a total of 247 workers dismissed by various factories registered with the Labor Bureau in accordance with the relief rules. Among them, 46 have been re-employed by the Labor Bureau, and 2 have been introduced to study at the Party School of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China; 56 people received travel expenses to return home, and 3 found jobs themselves. The Labor Bureau also organized 30 people to participate in semi-voluntary public works labor according to the provisions of the trial implementation rules.

When the relief measures were first implemented, workers had ideological concerns due to insufficient publicity and explanation work, such as the government not providing relief after unemployment, and the relief money being too little to solve the problem. After the implementation, the workers were very satisfied, feeling that "implementing this method is insurance" and "the government really takes care of us, this is something we have never had since we became workers." Most of the capitalists support the implementation of the relief measures, but some capitalists mistakenly believe that paying unemployment relief funds is a burden.

The experience of the past four months proves that to do a good job in collecting relief funds, it is necessary to cooperate with the trade unions and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to conduct publicity and explanation work for workers and capitalists separately. Some public factories were unwilling to pay relief funds due to insufficient understanding of the relief measures, citing reasons such as not laying off workers, which has now been resolved. Due to the fact that industry has not yet fully recovered and developed, and there is no need to recruit large numbers of workers, and the general cultural level of unemployed workers is low, while enterprises require higher cultural conditions when recruiting workers, the work of introducing employment has resulted in difficulties for unemployed workers in changing jobs. Therefore, political and cultural education, especially technical retraining, for unemployed workers has become the primary issue in the current work.

　　二至五月份失业员工救济金
    征收工作现已基本完成
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府执行《北京市救济失业员工决定试行细则》，四个月来，征收失业救济基金工作已基本完成。在十人以上应缴失业救济基金的工厂企业中，国营的有三十一户，二、三月份已全部缴纳，四月份缴纳的比例为百分之九三·六，五月份为百分之八○·六；市营的有二十三户，二月份缴纳的比例为百分之八五·七，三月份为百分之九○·九，四月份为百分之八六·九，五月份为百分之六十八·七；机关生产的有六十一户；二月份缴纳的比例为百分之八四·八，三、四月份为百分之八五·五，五月份为百分之四五·九。私营企业有三七三户，二月份缴纳的比例为百分之九六·六，三月份为百分之九四·一，四月份为百分之六九·七，五月份为三一·九。已在劳动局登记的各厂按救济细则解雇的工人截至五月二十七日止共二四七人，其中有四十六人已由劳动局介绍另行就业，有二人介绍至中共北京市委干训班学习；有五十六人领路费回家，有三人自己找到职业，劳动局并按试行细则的规定组织三十人参加半义务性质之公共工程劳动。
    开始执行救济办法时，由于宣传解释工作不够深入，工人存在着失业后政府不救济，领的救济金太少解决不了问题等思想顾虑。执行后，工人都很满意，觉得“执行这个办法保险”，“政府真照顾咱们，这是咱们从当工人以来没有的事”。资方大部分是赞成实行救济办法的，但也有的资方错误地认为缴纳失业救济基金是一种负担。
    四个月来的经验证明要做好征收救济基金就要配合工会和工商联合会对工人和资方分别进行宣传解释工作。若干公营工厂曾因对救济办法认识不够，以不解雇等原因不愿缴纳救济基金，现已解决。介绍就业的工作由于目前工业尚未充分恢复与发展，不需大批招工以及一般失业员工文化程度较低而企业部门招工时对文化条件要求较高，故造成了失业工人转业就业的困难。因此，对失业工人的政治文化教育，特别是技术转业训练便成为目前工作中的首要问题。
