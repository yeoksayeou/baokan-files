　　The Organization of the Soviet Lenin Pioneer Organization
    Dumanova
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League recently received a letter written to the young pioneers of China on May 25th by Shuya Dumanova, editor of the Soviet Pioneer newspaper "Pioneer Truth" and member of the Central Committee of the Lenin Communist Youth League, along with an article introducing the organization of the Lenin Pioneer Organization. The letter reads: "The young pioneers of the great Soviet Union extend warm greetings to the young pioneers of the People's Republic of China. They sincerely hope that their Chinese comrades will achieve even greater success in studying and assisting their people in building a free and independent New China. Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet young pioneers! Long live the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong! Long live the leader of the working people of the world, the good friend of children - the great and beloved Comrade Stalin!"
    The article "The Organization of the Lenin Pioneer Organization" sent by Dumanova is as follows:
    Twenty-eight years ago, in 1922, the first Pioneer detachment in the Soviet Union was established in the fighting, revolutionary district of Moscow - Red Presnya. Pioneer detachments were quickly established everywhere. The Fifth Congress of the Lenin Communist Youth League formed these detachments into a unified communist organization for children.
    The Lenin Pioneer Organization is a mass communist organization for Soviet children. It accepts a broad mass of students from the ages of nine to fourteen. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Youth League, children are educated in the spirit of communism, ardent Soviet patriotism, and boundless loyalty to the cause of Lenin and Stalin. Children grow up to be active and conscious builders and citizens of communist society. In 1924, after the death of the great leader Lenin, his name was given to the Pioneer Organization.
    The Communist Party and the Youth League lead the Pioneer Organization. The Communist Party constantly guides the work of the Pioneer Organization and directs the work of the Youth League with the Pioneer Organization. As early as 1923, the Party's Twelfth Congress pointed out the great significance of this communist organization for children and suggested that all Youth League members assist in the development of the Pioneer Organization. For the Youth League, leading the Pioneer Organization is one of the most important missions entrusted to it by the Bolshevik Party.
    The Party's leadership ensures the continuous growth of the Pioneer Organization and the improvement of its work content. Currently, the Soviet Pioneer Organization has a total of 14 million children. In the noble work of educating and nurturing children in Soviet schools, the young pioneers have become its true and fighting assistants.
    Lenin once said: The main task of youth is to learn. Stalin also constantly reminded the younger generation of the need to tenaciously master all kinds of knowledge. These instructions of the leaders are the program of action for the Pioneer Organization.
    The Pioneer detachment helps students deeply understand various types of knowledge. The young pioneers themselves can study well and become models of consciously treating the study of various subjects. At the same time, they also provide assistance to those who find it difficult to accept learning materials. Pioneer gatherings, various competitions, the election of outstanding young physicists, chemists, mathematicians, etc., and visits to museums, factories, workshops, collective farms, etc., are all for expanding and deepening the knowledge students obtain in the classroom.
    The Pioneer Organization has carried out tremendous work in the political education of students. They invite outstanding propagandists and lecturers to the schools, who explain domestic and foreign political events to the young pioneers in a simple and interesting way. Pioneer leaders report on political issues to the young pioneers based on materials from newspapers. The young pioneers study the biographies of Lenin and Stalin with great interest and love. The lives and activities of the great leaders become brilliant examples for the young pioneers: the young pioneers learn how to love their people and dedicate all their strength to the welfare of the people.
    The Pioneer detachment organizes many cultural and sports activities among the young pioneers.
    In the summer, we hold mass trips for young pioneers and students to study the borders of the motherland. In the summer of 1949, five million children participated in the trips. Young travelers went to places related to the lives and activities of Lenin and Stalin, to places where battles took place during the Great Patriotic War, and became familiar with the various constructions of the Stalin Five-Year Plan.
    The young pioneers actively participated in socially beneficial labor. The young pioneers of the Chebpatov School in Moscow Oblast built a large "Victory Garden" on an open space, and at the same time, they called on the young pioneers of the whole country to decorate the motherland with gardens. In 1949, more than seven million young pioneers and students participated in the All-Union competition of outstanding young gardeners.
    The young pioneers collected about 5,000 tons of seeds for planting field shelterbelts in the arid areas of our country. The young pioneers of Moscow installed radios for the families of collective farm members in several villages.
    The young pioneers concernedly help the families of those who heroically sacrificed themselves on the front lines in the Great Patriotic War. During the summer vacation, the young pioneers helped the farmers of the collective farm with harvesting.
    Many, many more such examples could be cited. All of these indicate that the young pioneers have been cultivated with a socialist attitude towards labor and the aspiration to enthusiastically participate in the Soviet people's struggle to build a communist society.
    In the Soviet Union, children receive preferential treatment. Many beautiful schools have been built for them. Libraries have been opened for them. In terms of childcare, there are 2,000 extracurricular institutions: Pioneer Palaces and Pioneer Houses, Young Technicians Research Stations, Young Natural Scientists Research Stations, Children's Theaters, etc. In the summer, thousands of Pioneer summer camps are opened for primary school students, where they consolidate their health and have a pleasant rest. Warmed by Stalin's concern, the talents and abilities of Soviet children are blooming like beautiful flowers in a garden.
    Last year, the Eleventh Congress of the Lenin Communist Youth League specifically discussed the issue of "the Youth League's work in schools." Now, the content of the Pioneer Organization's work has been improved, and the initiative and enthusiasm of the young pioneers have been further developed. The leading cadres of the Pioneer Organization have also been strengthened. Now, 110 educational colleges in our country have special departments for training counselors - leaders of the Pioneer Organization. Forty-two large cities have six-month short-term schools for training Pioneer leaders.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Lenin Communist Youth League and all the Pioneer leaders will educate children with a spirit of infinite loyalty to the cause of Lenin and Stalin from now on.

　　苏联列宁少年先锋队的组织
    杜曼诺娃
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央顷收到苏联少年队报纸《少先真理报》编辑、列宁共产主义青年团中央委员淑亚·杜曼诺娃于五月二十五日写给中国的少年儿童队员们的一封信，并寄文介绍列宁少年先锋队的组织。信里写道：“伟大的苏联的少年先锋队员向中华人民共和国的少年儿童队员们致以热烈的敬礼。他们衷心地希望自己中国的同志们在学习和协助自己的人民建设自由、独立的新中国的事业中取得更大的成就。中苏少年队的友谊万岁！中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志万岁！全世界劳动人民的领袖，儿童们的良友——伟大的、亲爱的斯大林同志万岁！”
    杜曼诺娃所寄《列宁少年先锋队的组织》一文如下：
    二十八年以前，即一九二二年，在莫斯科战斗的，革命的地区——红普列斯那成立了苏联的第一个少先队的中队。少先队的中队很快便在各地成立起来了。列宁共产主义青年团第五次代表大会把这些中队组成一个统一的儿童的共产主义组织。
    列宁少先队组织是苏联儿童的一种群众性的共产主义的组织。它接受九岁到十四岁的广大的学生群众。在共产党及青年团的领导下，儿童们被教育以共产主义的精神，热烈的苏维埃的爱国主义和对列宁——斯大林事业的无限忠诚。儿童们成长为共产主义社会的积极而自觉的建设者和公民。一九二四年，在伟大的领袖——列宁死后，他的名字便授予了少先队的组织。
    共产党和青年团领导着少先队组织。共产党经常指导少先队组织的工作，指导着青年团对少先队的工作。还是在一九二三年，党的第十二次代表大会就已经指出这个儿童共产主义的组织的巨大意义，并建议所有的少先队来协助发展少先队的组织。对青年团来说，领导少先队组织便是布尔什维克党所赋给它的最重要的使命之一。
    党的领导保证了少先队组织的不断增长及其工作内容的改进。目前苏联少先队组织共拥有一千四百万儿童。在苏联学校教育和培养儿童的崇高工作中，少先队员们已成为它真正的、战斗的助手。
    列宁曾说过：青年的主要任务就是学习。斯大林亦经常提醒青年一代关于顽强地掌握各种知识的必要性。领袖们的这些指示便是少先队组织的工作纲领。
    少先队的大队帮助同学们深刻地领会各种知识。少先队员们本身都能很好地学习并成为自觉对待学习各种功课的模范，同时，对于那些接受学习材料感到困难的人，他们还给以帮助。少先队的集会，各种各样的竞赛，优秀的青年物理学家、化学家、数学家等的竞选，到博物馆、工厂、作坊、集体农庄等处的参观，是为了开阔和加深学生们在课堂上所得到的知识。
    少先队组织在学生的政治教育方面进行了巨大的工作。他们把一些优秀的宣传家，讲演家邀请到学校里来，他们用简单而有趣的方式向少先队员们讲解国内外的政治事件。少先队的领导者根据报纸上的材料给少先队员们作政治问题的报导。少先队员们以极大的兴趣和热爱学习着列宁、斯大林的传记。伟大的领袖们的生平及活动成为少先队员的光辉范例：少先队员们学习着如何热爱自己的人民，并为人民的福利献出自己所有的力量。
    少先队的大队在少先队员中间组织了许多文化及体育活动。
    夏季我们举办少先队员和学生的群众性的旅行，去研究祖国的边疆。一九四九年夏天有五百万儿童参加了旅行。少年旅行家到各个与列宁和斯大林的生平及活动有关的地方，到过卫国战争中发生战役的地方，熟悉了斯大林五年计划的各种建设。
    少先队员们积极地参加了社会有益劳动。莫斯科州雀巴朵夫学校的少先队员们在空地上建设了一个大的“胜利花园”，同时他们并号召全国的少先队员用花园把祖国装饰起来。一九四九年，有七百余万少先队员和学生参加了全苏优秀少年园艺家的竞选。
    少先队员为我国干旱区种植田野防护林带收集了约五千吨种籽。莫斯科的少先队员把好几个村子集体农庄庄员的家庭都装上了无线电。
    少先队员关切地帮助那些在伟大的卫国战争中英勇地牺牲在前线的家庭。在暑假期间，少先队员帮助集体农庄的农民收割。
    这样的例子很够举出很多很多。所有这些都说明少先队员被培养了社会主义的劳动态度，和热烈参加苏联人民为建设共产主义社会而斗争的志向。
    在苏联，孩子们得到优越的待遇。为他们建筑了许多漂亮的学校。为他们开设了图书馆。在照顾儿童方面设有两千个校外机关：少先队宫和少先队之家、青年技术家研究站、青年自然科学家研究站、儿童剧院等。夏天为小学生们开办了成千的少先队夏令营，他们在那里巩固健康并愉快地休息。为斯大林的关怀所温暖着的苏联儿童，他们的天才和能力像花园里美丽的花朵一样地在开放着。
    去年列宁共产主义青年团的第十一次代表大会曾专门讨论了“关于青年团在学校的工作”这一问题。现在，少先队组织的工作内容改进了，少先队员的主动性和积极性有了更进一步的开展。少先队的领导干部亦加强了。现在，在我国一百一十所教育学院中都设有培养辅导员——少先队领导者的专门系别。在四十二个大城市中都有培养少先队领导者的六个月的短期学校。
    在共产党的领导下，列宁共产主义青年团和所有的少先队领导者今后将以无限忠诚列宁——斯大林事业的精神来教育孩子们。
