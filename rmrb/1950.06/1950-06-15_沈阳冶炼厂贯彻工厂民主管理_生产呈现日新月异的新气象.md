　　Shenyang Smelter Implements Factory Democratic Management
　　Production Presents a New and Ever-Changing Atmosphere
　　[Shenyang News] Northeast Daily, Ninth dispatch: From January to early April of this year, the Shenyang Smelter has completed the first half of the year's production tasks for ore-produced blister copper and electrolytic copper. By May 14th, it had also completed the first half of the year's production tasks for blister lead and electrolytic lead. Since October of last year, the factory has presented a new and ever-changing atmosphere in production. The significant improvement in production efficiency and the creation of various new records are achievements of this period.
　　The key to the factory's achievements lies in the implementation of democratic factory management.
　　First, the administration, Party committee, trade union, and Communist Youth League committee unite to focus on production. The administration takes the initiative to care about the work of the Party, trade union, and the Communist Youth League, consults with them on issues, provides them with convenience in their work, and regards them as indispensable and powerful guarantees for good production. The administration attaches great importance to the suggestions of the workers. Whatever can be done is done immediately, and if it cannot be done, an immediate answer is given. Even if the opinions are incorrect, they are patiently persuaded and educated. The administration also adopts a proactive attitude towards improving working conditions. The glasses and shoes, raincoats, and medical facilities used by workers during operation are promptly resolved. Similarly, the Party and trade union also attach great importance to ensuring the completion of the administrative production plan. For example, after the slogan "Start with improving technology to achieve cost reduction" was put forward in the May production plan, the Party committee took the initiative to deploy measures to guarantee the realization of the plan in various branches. In order to create new records for reducing costs and improving technology, the experience of technical symposiums was promoted. The trade union also led workers to universally establish group production plans and strengthened workshop propaganda and mobilization work to ensure the realization of the production plan. This overcomes the past shortcomings of the factory, such as the administration not solving various specific problems in production, the trade union simply engaging in welfare work, the weakness of the Party's strength, and the lack of a clear production concept.
　　Second, turn the production plan into the plan of all workers. The factory first brings the draft production plan to the workshops for discussion, absorbing the opinions of workshop cadres or technicians. Then, it is initially revised and then brought to the factory management committee for discussion, revision, and adoption. In this way, the task requirements of the leadership are combined with the production situation of the workshops. After the plan is formulated, it is conveyed to all employees through factory cadre meetings, worker representative meetings, and advanced producer meetings. Methods such as rewards, typical reports, and the dissemination of advanced experience in production are used to enable employees to further grasp the spirit of the plan. Then, a meeting of all workers in the workshop (or team/group) is convened, focusing on conveying the factory's overall production tasks related to the workshop. Each group formulates specific production goals based on the overall plan, identifies existing problems in production, and finds ways to overcome difficulties, and launches production competitions to strive to exceed the plan.
　　Third, a large number of workers with technical experience and organizational skills are promoted to serve as management personnel in workshop production, strengthening workshop leadership. Because if workshop leaders do not understand technology and cannot carry out organizational work, if they do not adopt methods to inspire workers' enthusiasm for production, but instead force workers to work with a stern face, it will lead to a lack of communication between leaders and workers, the production plan will not be implemented, and many positive suggestions from workers will not be reflected. Therefore, the factory focuses on the work of cultivating and promoting workshop leaders. During this period, a total of more than 70 worker cadres were promoted to take charge of workshop management, ensuring the thorough realization of the production plan throughout the factory.

### 沈阳冶炼厂贯彻工厂民主管理  生产呈现日新月异的新气象

　　沈阳冶炼厂贯彻工厂民主管理
    生产呈现日新月异的新气象
    【沈阳讯】东北日报九日消息：沈阳冶炼厂自今年一月至四月上旬，已完成矿石产粗铜及电解铜上半年全部的生产任务；到五月十四日止，又完成了粗铅及电解铅上半年全部生产任务。该厂自去年十月以来，生产上即呈现了日新月异的新气象。生产效率的大大提高，多种新纪录的创造，都是这一时期的成就。
    该厂所以获得成就的关键是贯彻工厂管理民主化。
    首先，行政、党委、工会、团工委团结一致搞生产。行政上主动关心党、工、团的工作，找他们商议问题，给他们以工作的便利，把他们看作是搞好生产不可缺少的有力保证。行政上对职工的建议是十分重视的。凡是能办到的立即办，不能办到的当即回答，即使不对的意见，也耐心的给以说服和教育。对劳动条件的改善，行政上又采取积极关心的态度。工人操作时用的眼镜及鞋子、雨衣、医疗所等，都得到及时的解决。同样，党和工会也非常重视保证行政生产计划的完成。如五月份生产计划中，提出：“从提高技术着手，达到降低成本”的口号后，党委即主动在各支部中布置了保证实现计划的作法；为创造降低成本提高技术的新纪录，推广了技术座谈会的经验。工会也领导职工普遍订立了小组生产计划，加强了车间宣传鼓动工作，以保证生产计划的实现。因而克服了过去该厂行政上不解决生产中各种具体问题，工会单纯搞福利工作，党的力量微弱和生产观念不明确的缺点。
    其次，将生产计划变成全体工人自己的计划。该厂先将生产计划草案拿到车间去讨论，吸收车间干部或技术员的意见。然后加以初步修正，再拿到工厂管理委员会上讨论、修正后通过。这样，就使领导的任务要求和车间的生产情况结合了起来。计划订出以后，又通过全厂干部大会、职工代表会议、先进生产者会议等向全体职工作传达。并采用奖励，典型报告，传播生产中的先进经验等方法，使职工进一步掌握计划的精神。然后召开车间（或股、班）全体工人会议，着重传达与本车间有关的全厂生产任务，每个小组根据总的计划，制定具体的生产目标，找出生产中存在的问题和克服困难的办法，并发动生产竞赛，争取超过计划。
    第三，大批提拔有技术经验与组织才能的工人，充当车间生产的管理人员，加强车间领导。因为车间领导人，如果不懂技术与不会进行组织工作；如果不是采取启发工人生产积极性的办法，而是板着面孔去强制工人作工，那就会形成领导与工人的不通气，生产计划也就贯彻不下去，工人许多积极建议也反映不上来。因之，该厂着重了培养和提拔车间领导人的工作。在这一时期中，共提拔工人干部七十余名，掌握车间管理工作，保证了生产计划在全厂的彻底实现。
