To the Editor:

　　During the land reform in 1946 in our village (Yanzhuang Village, Fourth District, En County, Hebei), many middle peasants, due to a lack of understanding of the government's policies and fear of being struggled against, offered up some of their land. At that time, the peasant association, which was in charge of policy, also had some biases, and actually accepted a portion and returned a portion. Some who offered up two plots of land had one plot accepted by the peasant association and one plot returned. After that, everyone believed that the land reform was over, and most people settled down to production. Who knew that in April of this year, the cadres in our village again used coercive means to demand the return of over 140 mu of the previously returned land from the 26 middle-peasant households who had offered it up. Su Wangshi, a widow in our village, lives separately from her son. She had just plowed and harrowed her seven mu of land south of the village and had hauled all the manure to the field when she heard that the village cadres were going to take that land away from her. She begged and pleaded several times, but in the end, that land was still taken. Another example is Su Liangcheng, who had earned some money by carrying oil and selling tofu and bought land. This time, militiamen threatened him with guns, demanding that he hand over five and a half mu of land. Su Liangcheng was afraid and handed over the land, but soon became ill with anger and died. Of the land that was taken away, 70 percent of the good land and land near the village were divided up among several village cadres. Now, the production enthusiasm of the masses in the whole village is very low. Everything stated above is the truth, and if there is any fabrication, we are willing to be punished by the government. We earnestly hope that you will quickly inform the relevant leading organs to investigate and handle this matter.

　　Households Whose Land Was Taken: Su Jixian, Su Yingpu (Su Liangcheng's nephew), Su Bangtian, Su Zidong, Su Qinggao, Su Hongtian, Su Qingmao, Su Qingtong, Zhang Kaichen, Fang Zhengxiang, representing 26 households in total.

　　Editor's Note: The encroachment on middle peasants' land by the cadres of Yanzhuang Village, En County, is a serious error that violates the government's land reform policy. If the situation described in the letter is true, then not only should the land taken from the middle peasants be returned promptly, but the village cadres who encroached upon the middle peasants' land by means of coercion and threats should be punished. We hope that the En County government will quickly investigate the truth of this matter, make a decision, and publish it in this newspaper.

　　恩县阎庄村干部
    非法侵犯中农土地
    望恩县县府调查处理编辑同志：
    我们村子（河北恩县四区阎庄村）在一九四六年进行土地改革时，有好些中农因对政府政策不了解，怕被斗争，献出了好些土地。当时农会掌握政策也有偏向，竟然收下了一部分，退还一部分。有的献出两块土地，农会收下一块，退还一块。此后大家认为土改结束了，大都安心生产。那知道今年四月里，我们村里的干部又用强迫手段向献地的二十六户中农要回原先退还的土地一百四十多亩。本村寡妇苏王氏，母子分居。她刚把庄南的七亩地耕耙好，并把所有的粪都拉到了地里，听说村干部要将她这块地抽去，哭求数次，结果那块地还是给抽去了。又如苏良成，过去挑油挑、卖豆腐挣了些钱，买了土地。这次民兵拿枪威胁他，要他拿出五亩半地来。苏良成心里害怕，将地交出，但不久即气愤成病，死了。在这些被抽出来的土地中，百分之七十的好地、近地都被几个村干部瓜分了。现在全村群众生产情绪非常低。以上所说都是实情，如有虚造，情愿受到政府的制裁。万望迅速转告有关领导机关调查处理。
    被抽地户：苏吉现  苏英普（苏良成之侄）
    苏邦田  苏子栋  苏清皋  苏洪田
    苏清茂  苏清同  张开臣  房正祥代表二十六户共告 
    编者按：恩县阎庄村干部侵犯中农土地，是违反政府土地改革政策的严重错误行为。信中所说的情况如果确实，则不仅被抽的中农土地应该迅速退还，而且那些以强迫、威胁手段侵犯中农土地的村干部，则应受处分。我们希望恩县县政府迅速调查此事真相，做出决定，并在本报公布。
