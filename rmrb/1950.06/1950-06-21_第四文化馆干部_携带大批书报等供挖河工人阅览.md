Fourth Cultural Center Cadres
Carry Large Quantities of Books and Newspapers for Canal Digging Workers to Read

[Reported by this newspaper] Cadres from the Fourth Cultural Center, in coordination with comrades from the Sixth District Office, have been carrying large quantities of picture story books and popular literature to the canal digging workers outside You'anmen every day since the 12th of this month, providing them for reading, which has been greatly welcomed by the workers. As soon as break time arrives, groups of people gather under the shade of the willow trees along the riverbank, reading the books with great interest. Some read and tell the stories to others. The workers also universally requested to read newspapers, saying, "We want to understand what is happening around us." The center purchased local newspapers and added new books on the 13th of this month and took them along.

[Further News] The "Medical and Health Group" of the "Science Popularization Group," in cooperation with the center, has held five lectures on "Summer Hygiene" and "Maternal and Child Hygiene," with a total of 1,029 attendees. The Peking University Medical College gave another lecture on "Summer Epidemic Prevention Issues" in the center's lecture hall on the evening of the 17th. Several students from the college conducted general health check-ups for the students of the center's adult night school on the 16th and 23rd of this month and provided free medical services.
