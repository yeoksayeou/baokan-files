Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th: The Northeast China Grain Company of the China National Grain Corporation has allocated a total of 76.8 million jin of grain to help farmers in disaster areas solve food shortages during planting and summer hoeing. This grain has been allocated to Liaoxi, Rehe, Songjiang, and Liaodong provinces for the advance purchase of wheat and other coarse grains in areas affected by disasters last year. The advance purchase is calculated at a rate of six liang of wheat for one jin of sorghum. All the grain purchased in advance will be promptly distributed to the disaster victims by the local government and cooperatives to ensure it is used for production and not for grain trading. In addition, in order to take care of farmers in severely affected areas who need to buy grain with cash, the company has also stipulated that people in severely affected areas of Rehe and Liaoxi who hold certificates from the district government can buy grain from state-owned grain companies with a 10% discount on the local grain price.

　　东北区粮食公司拨粮帮助灾区农民
    解决耕种夏锄中的食粮困难
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】中国粮食公司东北区公司为帮助灾区农民解决耕种夏锄中的食粮困难，拨出粮谷共达七千六百八十万斤，分别在辽西、热河、松江、辽东四省去年受灾地区预购小麦及其他粗粮。预购按一斤高粱换购小麦六两计算。全部预购粮谷均委托当地政府及合作社迅速分拨到灾民手里，保证用于生产，不做粮食买卖。此外，该公司为照顾重灾区农民以现款买粮，又规定凡热河、辽西重灾区人民持有区政府证明，到国营粮食公司买粮，一律按当地粮价九折优待。
