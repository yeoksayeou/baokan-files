　　USSR Submits Memorandum to US, UK, France, etc.
    Settlement of Antarctic Governance Must Include Soviet Participation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th] TASS, Moscow: The Soviet government, on the 7th, through its diplomatic representatives in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Norway, Australia, Argentina, and New Zealand, submitted to the respective governments a memorandum regarding the issue of Antarctic governance.
    The memorandum pointed out: Since 1948, spokespersons for the foreign ministries of several countries, including the US and the UK, have mentioned negotiations regarding Antarctica initiated by the US State Department and conducted by the US, UK, France, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Chile, with the aim of resolving the issue of Antarctic governance.
    The memorandum stated: The Soviet government cannot agree to a settlement of the Antarctic governance issue without Soviet participation. The Soviet government declares that, according to international practice, all relevant countries should be invited to participate in discussions regarding the governance of any region of international importance. From a scientific and economic perspective, Antarctica holds significant value for many countries; for example, the Soviet Union conducts whaling operations there. Meteorological observations in Antarctica are of great significance to the Northern Hemisphere. Soviet navigators have also made important discoveries in Antarctica. The issue of its governance should be discussed on an international scale to reach an agreement that adequately meets the legitimate interests of all relevant countries.
    The memorandum concluded: The Soviet government is willing to consider any suggestions from the relevant governments regarding the manner of discussing the aforementioned issue and the nature of Antarctic governance.

　　苏向美英法等国提备忘录
    解决南极洲管治权不能没有苏联参加
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府于七日经由苏联驻美国、英国、法国、挪威、澳大利亚、阿根廷和新西兰各国的外交代表，向各该国政府提出了关于南极洲管治权问题的备忘录。
    备忘录指出：一九四八年以来，美、英等若干国家的外交部发言人，曾提起了由美国国务院所发起，由美、英、法、挪威、澳大利亚、新西兰、阿根廷和智利等国所进行的关于南极的谈判，其目的是要解决南极洲的管治权的问题。
    备忘录提出：苏联政府不能同意没有苏联参加而解决南极洲的管治权问题。苏联政府声明：按照国际惯例，应邀请一切有关国家参与讨论具有国际重要性的任何区域的管治权问题。从科学和经济观点上说，南极洲对许多国家均有重大价值，例如苏联便在南极进行捕鲸工作。南极的气象学观测，对北半球具有重要意义。苏联航海家亦曾对南极有重要发现。目前应当在国际的规模上来讨论其管治权的问题，以便达成一种足以符合一切有关国家之合法利益的协议。
    备忘录末称：苏联政府愿意考虑各有关政府就讨论上述问题的方式，以及就南极洲管治权的性质所提出的任何建议。
