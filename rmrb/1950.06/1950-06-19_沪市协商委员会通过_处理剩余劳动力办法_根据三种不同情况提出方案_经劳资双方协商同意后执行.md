Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors have established specific measures for handling surplus labor while maintaining production and overcoming difficulties. These measures were drafted by the Labor-Capital Relations Group of the Municipal Consultative Committee, based on the spirit of the resolutions of the Third Shanghai People's Representative Conference. They have been repeatedly researched and unanimously approved by the Municipal Consultative Committee, and submitted to the government as a proposal for adoption. The Municipal People's Government has approved the measures and ordered the Labor Bureau to use them as a reference for labor-capital consultations to resolve surplus labor issues. The main points of the measures are:

　　1. For industrial and commercial enterprises whose production is insufficient to cover costs but whose production and sales do not have major problems and whose funds can still be maintained with difficulty, temporary and reasonable wage reduction measures can be adopted to strive to save, increase production, and reduce costs to maintain current production. In the future, when production recovers and does not hinder operations, wages should be gradually restored.

　　2. For industrial and commercial enterprises with abnormal production and sales, high costs, and temporary surplus labor, measures such as increasing the number of shifts, reducing the working hours of each worker, or adopting a shift work system can be taken. During the downtime, the employer should pay wages equivalent to 30% of the salary, in principle, based on the specific conditions of each industry. Those with difficulties shall be resolved through consultation between labor and management of the enterprise. During the downtime, the trade union is responsible for organizing learning.

　　3. For industrial and commercial enterprises with irregular production and sales, excessive expenses, bloated organizations, and fundamentally surplus manpower, which genuinely need to streamline their organizations and reform their internal structures to maintain production, the principle of the "Shanghai Municipality's Provisional Relief Measures for Employees Suspended with Pay to Maintain Production," passed by the Third Shanghai People's Representative Conference, can be applied. For redundant personnel who are truly not needed for production in the long term, streamlining should be implemented, and they should be suspended with pay. In principle, the employer should pay 30% of the salary per month for one year. If there are still no employment opportunities after one year, they will be handled according to the unemployment worker relief measures. During this period of suspension with pay, the trade union is responsible for organizing learning to improve their political, cultural, and technical levels, and to expand their employment or career change conditions.

　　The above three treatment methods for different enterprises should be based on the actual situation of the enterprise, and the employer should propose a specific plan, which should be implemented after labor and management have unanimously agreed. If the suspension with pay method is implemented, it should also be reported to the Labor Bureau for approval before it becomes effective.

　　沪市协商委员会通过
    处理剩余劳动力办法
    根据三种不同情况提出方案  经劳资双方协商同意后执行
    【新华社上海十六日电】上海工商业在维持生产克服困难中，对剩余劳动力的处理，业已订出具体办法。这一办法是由市协商委员会劳资关系小组根据第三次各界人民代表会议决议精神拟定的，已经市协商委员会反复研讨后一致通过，并作为建议案提请政府采纳。市人民政府已予同意，并命令劳动局将该项办法作为劳资协商解决剩余劳动力之参考。办法要点为：
    一、生产虽不够成本而产销尚无大问题、资金还勉强能维持之工商企业，可采取暂时的合理递减工资办法，力求节约增产、减低成本，维持目前生产；在将来生产恢复、不妨碍经营的情况下，逐步予以恢复。
    二、产销不正常、成本过高、劳动力暂时过剩之工商企业，可采取加开班数，减少每个工人工作时间的办法，或采轮班工作制。停工时间之薪工，按各业具体情况，由资方付给相当于百分之三十的工资为原则。其有困难者，经各该企业劳资双方协商解决之。职工在停工时间，由工会负责组织学习。
    三、产销不经常，开支过大，机构臃肿，人力根本过剩，确需紧缩机构、改革内部才能维持生产的工商企业，可根据上海市第三届各界人民代表会议所通过的“上海市为维持生产，停薪留职员工暂行救济办法”的原则，对确为生产长期所不需的多余人员，加以紧缩，实行停薪留职，由资方于一年内按月付给百分之三十的工资为原则；一年以后如尚无就业机会时，则按失业工人救济办法处理之。在此停薪留职期间内，由工会负责组织学习，以提高其政治文化技术水平，扩大就业或转业条件。
    以上对不同企业的三项处理办法，应由资方根据本企业实际情形，提出具体方案，经劳资双方协商一致同意后实行。如实行停薪留职办法时，并应呈报劳动局经核准后，方为有效。
