How to Compensate for Land Occupation When Digging Rivers
    Water Resources Department Answers Reader Questions

    Editor:
    I have two questions now, please forward them to the relevant government departments for resolution to reassure the people. The questions are as follows:
    (1) In the counties of Xianghe, Baodi, and Ninghe in eastern Beijing, a new river has been opened (Editor's note: this river is called the Chaobai River). Now the embankments are being built, but the river channel has not yet been dug. Although the occupied land has been surveyed by the government, the handling method has not been announced. The areas occupied by this river are mostly disaster areas (severely affected areas), and there was no harvest last year. Taking Xianghe and Baodi counties as examples, most of the land being dug is wheat fields, and the seeds for the masses to plant wheat were mostly obtained through borrowing and selling furniture. The general public does not understand the importance of the government's water conservancy policies for production and flood control, and people are unsettled. May I ask the government if there are any specific measures to solve this problem? How will the loss of wheat fields be compensated? After the farmers' land (some places have undergone land reform, some have not completed land reform, and some have not issued land certificates) is occupied, is there a way to ensure that they have land to cultivate?
    (2) The river is currently being embanked, but the river channel has not yet been dug. Will it still be necessary to dig the river channel?
              Respectfully submitted by Zhang Peixun, Zhang Jia Village, Third District, Baodi County
Mr. Zhang Peixun:
    The questions raised in your letter have been forwarded to the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government for answers as follows:
    (1) Regarding the compensation for land occupation when digging rivers: The Hebei Provincial People's Government has promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Compensation for Land Occupation, Land Use, and Relocation in Water Conservancy Project Construction in Hebei Province," and the Chaobai River Project, sponsored by the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, will also be handled in accordance with the provisions of these measures.
    (2) Regarding the question of whether a river channel needs to be dug between the two embankments: According to investigation and research, the flood during the flood season of the Chaobai River is very large, but the water volume in winter and spring is very small. Therefore, the new Chaobai River channel, according to the engineering plan, is only to build dikes on both sides to confine the water and prevent flooding, and it is not planned to dig a river channel in the middle. In this way, on the one hand, the larger floods of the Chaobai River during the flood season can enter and exit, without overflowing, which can reduce floods. On the other hand, because the water is small in winter and spring, some land between the two dikes can still benefit from one crop of water and one crop of wheat.

    Editor's note: According to the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for Compensation for Land Occupation, Land Use, and Relocation in Water Conservancy Project Construction in Hebei Province," for land occupied in areas where land reform has not been carried out, the local government is responsible for adjusting the land, and no additional price will be issued. For land occupied that has already undergone land reform, it is also necessary to adjust all or part of it as much as possible to facilitate production. If the adjusted land is allocated from private property, appropriate compensation must be given according to the land occupation regulations. In areas where land reform has been implemented and cannot be adjusted, it will be purchased at a price equivalent to one and a half to two years of production (based on the agricultural tax registration production, same below) of the occupied land. For land occupied in areas particularly severely affected by disasters along the Chaobai River flood diversion channel, it will be purchased at a price equivalent to three years of production. For land occupied by straightening bends, if the old river channel can still be cultivated and its harvest can offset the occupied land, the old river channel will be allocated for compensation. If the estimated output of the old river channel differs greatly from the occupied land, the difference in value between the occupied land and the newly allocated river channel land should be compensated. If the old river channel cannot be cultivated, it will be treated the same as general land occupation. Generally, no compensation is given for using land within the statutory dike foot; no compensation is given for digging white land that does not affect planting; if planting is possible but the output is reduced, appropriate compensation may be given. For digging up green seedlings, if it does not delay planting, only the seeds, labor, and fertilizer will be compensated; if it is closer to the harvest period, compensation will not exceed 60% of the assessed output. If planting is not possible in the current year, 50% of the output will be compensated. If planting is possible in the second year, but it affects the output, compensation may be added for the loss due to the reduction in land value. If there are green seedlings, additional compensation will be given according to the green seedling compensation method. If the excavation is too deep and planting is not possible for a long time, it will be treated as land occupation.

### 挖河占用民地如何补偿  水利部答读者问

　　挖河占用民地如何补偿
    水利部答读者问编辑同志：
    现在我有两项问题，请你们转请政府有关部门设法解决，以安民心。问题如下：
    （一）京东沿香河、宝坻、宁河等县，新开河流一道（编者按：此河名潮白河），现在搭埝，尚未掘河沟。所占土地虽经政府调查，但未公布处理办法。按这道河流所占地区多属灾区（重灾区），去岁全年没有收成。以香、宝两县而论，所掘多属麦田，群众种麦之种籽，大部分是由借贷和变卖家具而来。一般群众不知政府兴修水利政策对生产防汛之重要，人心不定。请问政府，现在有无具体办法，解决这个问题？麦田损失如何补偿？农民土地（有的地方已经土地改革，有的地方未完成土改，有的地方未发土地证）被占用后，有无办法使其有地可耕？
    （二）该河现正在搭埝，尚未掘河沟，是否还要挑河沟？
              宝坻县三区张贾村  张佩勋敬启张佩勋先生：
    来信所提问题，已转请中央人民政府水利部解答如下：
    （一）关于挖河占用民地的补偿问题：河北省人民政府已公布“河北省水利工程建设占地使土和迁移的补偿暂行办法”，华北水利工程局主办的潮白河工程亦根据此办法之规定予以处理。
    （二）两埝间是否需挑河沟问题：根据调查研究，潮白河汛期洪水甚大，可是冬春水量又都很小。所以潮白河新河道，依据工程计划，只是两边筑堤束水，防止洪水漫流，中间不拟挖掘河沟。这样一方面可使潮白河汛期较大的洪水，能够出入，不致漫流横溢，可以减轻水灾。另一方面因为冬春水小，两堤之间还有一部分土地可收一水一麦之利。
                编者
    编者按：按照《河北省水利工程建设占地使土和迁移的补偿暂行办法》的规定，占用未经土地改革地区之土地，由地方政府负责调剂土地，不另发价。占用已经土地改革之土地，亦须尽可能调剂全部或一部，以利生产。其调剂之土地如系从私产拨出，则须按占地规定给以适当补偿。在已实行土地改革并无法调剂的地区，按被占的土地一年半至二年的产量（按农业税登记产量，下同）折价收买。潮白河分洪道所经灾情特别严重地区的占地，按三年产量折价收买。裁弯取直所占的土地，如旧河道尚能耕种，且其收获量与被占地可以相抵者，则以旧河道拨赔。如旧河道产量估计与被占地相差很大，则应酌赔被占地与新拨河道地估价之差额。若旧河道不能耕种，则与一般占地同样处理。在法定的堤根内使土，一般不赔偿；掘挖白地不影响种植者不赔偿；虽能种植但产量减少者，得酌予赔偿。挖掘青苗，尚不误种植的，只赔种籽、人工、肥料；如距收获期较近者，赔偿不超过评估产量的百分之六十。当年不能种植的，赔偿产量百分之五十。如第二年虽能种植，但影响产量者，得酌加因地价减低所受损失之赔偿。如有青苗，再按青苗赔偿办法加赔。挖掘过深，长期不能种植的，以占地论。
