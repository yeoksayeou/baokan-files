Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: The Chinese Trade Union Delegation, which departed on April 24th of this year, returned to Beijing on the 27th. The delegation participated in the "May Day" International Labor Day commemorative rallies in the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia. Subsequently, in Hungary, East Germany, London, England, and other places, they attended the World Federation of Trade Unions' Executive Bureau meeting, Executive Committee meeting, joint meetings of various industrial trade union internationals, the International Administrative Conference of the Metalworkers' Union, and the Executive Bureau meeting of the World Peace Congress. After returning to Shenyang from abroad on the 19th of this month, the delegation reported on the international labor movement, the world peace movement, and overseas experiences in major factories and mines in Northeast China for a week.

Liu Ningyi, the head of the delegation and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, told reporters: The struggle to defend world peace has become the center of all mass movements of the world's people. Therefore, the delegation mainly engaged in this work abroad. The delegation participated in various meetings to strengthen the unity of the world working class, defend world peace and people's democracy, and oppose the war conspiracies of imperialism. The delegation learned valuable experience in production and construction from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. The delegation also witnessed the incurable economic crisis in imperialist countries and the crazy oppression of the people by the big bourgeoisie in these countries. American workers' wages have been frozen. There are more than 45 million unemployed workers in all capitalist countries. These phenomena show that the war clamor of imperialism is essentially a manifestation of the deepening imperialist crisis. With the world's forces for defending peace growing stronger, the war-mongers' conspiracy to provoke war is bound to fail.

　　访问苏联东欧参加世界工联会议后
    我工会代表团返京
    团长刘宁一对记者谈话称保卫和平为世界群运中心
    【新华社二十八日讯】本年四月二十四日出国的中国工会代表团，已于二十七日返京。代表团曾分别参加了苏联、波兰、东德和捷克的“五一”国际劳动节纪念大会，随后又在匈牙利、东德、英国伦敦等地，参加了世界工联召开的执行局会议、执行委员会议、各产业工会国际联席会议、五金工会国际行政会议以及世界保卫和平大会执行局会议。代表团于本月十九日由国外回到沈阳后，曾于一周之内在东北各主要厂矿，报告了国际工运及保卫世界和平运动的情况和国外见闻。
    代表团团长、中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一对记者谈称：为保卫世界和平而斗争，已成为目前世界人民一切群众运动的中心，因此，代表团在国外也主要是从事这一件工作。代表团参加了各种会议，都是要加强世界工人阶级的团结，保卫世界和平与人民民主，反对帝国主义的战争阴谋。代表团学习了苏联及各人民民主国家在生产建设方面的宝贵经验。代表团也看到了帝国主义国家不可救药的经济危机，和这些国家的大资产阶级对于人民的疯狂压迫。美国工人的工资被冻结了。整个资本主义各国有四千五百万以上的失业工人。这些现象说明帝国主义的战争叫嚣，本质上乃是帝国主义危机加深的表现。而在世界保卫和平力量日益加强的情况下，战争贩子们挑动战争的阴谋，必然要遭到失败。
