    Continuing to Improve Workers' Spare-Time Schools

    [Our Newspaper, Tianjin] Since Tangda District in Tianjin started establishing workers' spare-time schools in November of last year, they have gradually developed over six months. Now, twenty workers' spare-time schools have been established, totaling one hundred and thirty-two classes. The number of workers and on-the-job cadres participating in learning is five thousand one hundred and forty-two (approximately three thousand industrial workers, three hundred and forty-two on-the-job cadres, and the rest being dockworkers, salt field workers, sailors, and about three hundred ordinary citizens). This accounts for more than thirty percent of the total number of workers in Tangda District, and about half of the industrial workers are already enrolled.

    Among these spare-time schools, eleven are mainly organized by schools, and nine are mainly organized by factories. Generally, a school committee is organized to take charge of leadership work, and a full-time director of education is appointed. The students have organized student unions, elected class representatives, and divided into mutual aid groups. Most spare-time schools have established attendance, examination, reward, meeting, and reporting systems. Learning agreements and classroom agreements have been formulated through democratic discussions among the students. Especially in spare-time schools such as the Yongli Factory and Dagu Shipyard, learning is progressing regularly.

    The development of workers' spare-time education in Tangda District has generally gone through three stages. School establishment began in November last year. The Propaganda Department of the Tangda District Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Cultural and Educational Section of the District Government, the District Federation of Trade Unions, the Cultural Center, and youth and women's organizations jointly formed a preparatory committee for spare-time schools. Various schools and factories successively established spare-time schools, but this period still lacked a clear direction, and the spare-time schools basically had not yet broken away from the mixed literacy class nature of the past.

    From late February of this year, various spare-time schools held grade placement tests, and later held expanded enrollment. At the same time, the entire district established a unified leadership organization mainly composed of government cultural and educational departments - the General School Affairs Committee and its working groups. The Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau sent eleven full-time cadres, and some spare-time schools established a system of designated personnel in charge. All schools began to improve their organizations, establish systems, unify curricula, and begin to improve teaching methods. However, due to the rapid development in March and April, the number of schools reached twenty-one with more than five thousand seven hundred students in early May. Some schools, due to unsound leadership, lack of teachers, and incomplete textbooks, experienced a temporary state of disorder.

    After May, it entered a stage of reorganization and consolidation. It was stipulated that each school should generally be organized into classes with sixty people as a principle. Some spare-time schools made appropriate adjustments, being reorganized into twenty schools with one hundred and thirty-two classes. At the same time, leadership was strengthened, emphasizing "principal in charge, contact with the trade union," in order to correct the bias of some schools' leadership and union cadres who believed that spare-time schools were affiliated and made excuses for being busy to push overall responsibility to full-time cadres. Various working groups also regularly went to various schools to inspect, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner. For example, some children and citizens were mixed in some spare-time schools, and classes are now being prepared for them separately. There are also some informal literacy classes composed of salt workers outside the schools, and they are also being helped to gradually improve.

    In order to solve the conflict between study time and production time, various spare-time schools have adopted three methods according to the situation: First, for workers in three-shift jobs in factories such as Yongli and Jiuda, the method of teachers and class times changing with the shifts was adopted so that teaching can be carried out in a planned manner. Second, some sailors often move with the ships, so they use the ship as a classroom or organize by ship. When the ship goes to sea, the study group leads the learning, and after returning, make-up lessons are held regularly. At the same time, teachers also depart with the ship in a focused manner to teach on board. Third, for dockworkers and salt workers, etc., because work is irregular and mobile, it has been decided to hire more full-time teachers to strengthen make-up lessons. However, under the current conditions, there is still no better solution.

    In addition, each spare-time school has established a "Teaching Method and Textbook Research Association," and the leaders provide learning materials to strengthen the learning of teachers and research and improve teaching methods.

### 天津市塘大区  继续改进职工业余学校

　　天津市塘大区
    继续改进职工业余学校
    【本报天津讯】天津市塘大区自去年十一月开始建立工人业余学校以来，六个月中逐步发展，现在已设立了二十所工人业余学校，计一百三十二班，参加学习的工人和在职干部共五千一百四十二名（其中产业工人约三千人，在职干部三百四十二人，其他为码头工人、盐田工人、海员和三百左右普通市民），约占塘大区工人总数的百分之三十强，产业工人则约有一半已入学。
    这些业余学校中，有十一处是以学校为主举办的，九处是以工厂为主举办的。一般都组织了校委会负责领导工作，并设置了专职的教导主任。学员们组织了学生会，推选出班代表，又分了互助小组。大部业余学校都建立了考勤、考试、奖励、会议、汇报等制度，并通过学员民主讨论制订了学习公约和教室公约，特别是永利厂和大沽修船厂等处的业余学校，学习已能正规地进行。
    塘大区工人业余教育的开展大体上经过了三个阶段。去年十一月开始建校，由中共塘大区委会宣传部、区政府文教股、区工会、文化馆、和青年、妇女等团体共同组成了业余学校筹委会，各学校和工厂相继成立业余学校，但这一时期还缺乏明确的方针，各业余学校基本上还没有脱离过去混合性的识字班性质。
    今年二月下旬起，各业余学校举行了编级试验，以后又举行扩大招生。同时，全区成立了以政府文教部门为主的统一领导机构——总校务委员会及其工作小组。津市教育局派来了十一名专职干部，部分业余学校建立了专人负责制。各校均开始健全组织，树立制度，统一课程，并开始改进教学方法，但因三、四月间发展太快，至五月初达到了二十一校五千七百多学员，有的学校因领导不健全，师资缺乏，课本不齐，曾呈现一时紊乱的状态。
    五月以后，进入了整编和巩固阶段。规定各校一般以六十人为原则编班，一部分业余学校作了适当的调整，编为二十校、一三二班。同时加强领导，强调“校长负责，联系工会”，以纠正一部分学校与工会的领导干部认为业余学校是附设的，借口工作忙，把全盘责任推给专职干部的偏向。各工作小组并经常到各校去检查，发掘问题，及时解决。如个别业余学校中混杂着一些儿童与市民，正拟另编班次上课。校外还有一些由盐工组成的非正规的识字班，也在帮助他们逐渐健全起来。
    为解决学习时间与生产时间的冲突，各业余学校按情况采取了三种办法：一、如对永利、久大等厂三班倒工作的工人，采取了教员与上课时间随班变动的办法，使教学能有计划地进行。二、部分海员经常随船流动，便以船为教室，或按船编组。船出海时由学习小组领导学习，回来以后定时补课。同时教员也有重点地随船出发，在船上教学。三、码头工人、盐工等，因工作无定时，流动性大，决定多请专任教员，加强补课。但在目前条件下，仍无较好的解决办法。
    此外，各业余学校都成立了“教法教材研究会”，由领导上发给学习资料，以加强教员的学习，研究改进教学方法。
