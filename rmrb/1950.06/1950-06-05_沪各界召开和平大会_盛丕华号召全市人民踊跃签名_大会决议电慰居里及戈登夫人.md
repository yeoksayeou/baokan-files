Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 4th. The Shanghai branch of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace held a city-wide conference of all circles to defend world peace on the 2nd, in order to further promote the signature campaign. Nearly a thousand representatives from all walks of life attended, and Xiao San, head of the China World Peace Defense Propaganda Group, also attended and gave a speech. At the meeting, Sheng Pihua, Deputy Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, called on the city's five million citizens to continue to actively sign their names on the peace declaration to express the determination and strength of the Shanghai people to defend world peace. Fan Xiaofeng, a worker representative, said passionately at the meeting: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our Shanghai workers have always stood at the forefront of the struggle. Today, in order to consolidate the great victory we have achieved, we resolutely oppose wars of aggression. Wu Yaozong, a representative of the religious community, emphasized: Defending world peace is not an empty wish, but must be demonstrated in ideological and action struggles. In the past, many people in the religious community had illusions about imperialism, but the imperialists' war conspiracy has awakened everyone. Only by crushing this conspiracy can there be lasting world peace and true happiness. Lu Yu Dao, a representative of the scientific community, said: The strength of the people's scientific community is already very strong, and the atomic bomb cannot scare us. The conference also unanimously passed two telegrams of condolence to Professor Joliot-Curie and Mrs. Joliot-Curie, and to the peace-loving people of the United States.

The signature campaign in all circles of Shanghai is currently continuing on a wider scale. As of the end of May, more than 500,000 people have signed, including 150,000 workers and more than 10,000 farmers in the suburbs. Workers at the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory of the Shanghai Railway Bureau repaired a locomotive in Red May and named it "Peace," which arrived in Shanghai on the 1st. The front of the train was decorated with white doves and painted with the slogan "Intensify railway construction with revolutionary competition, and defend world peace with practical actions" in red paint.

　　沪各界召开和平大会
    盛丕华号召全市人民踊跃签名
    大会决议电慰居里及戈登夫人
    【新华社上海四日电】中国保卫世界和平大会委员会上海分会，为了更深入地展开签名运动，特于二日召开全市各界保卫世界和平大会。出席各界代表近千人，中国保卫世界和平宣传团团长萧三等亦到会演讲。会上，上海市人民政府副市长盛丕华号召全市五百万市民继续踊跃地把名字签到和平宣言上去，以表示上海人民保卫世界和平的决心和力量。工人代表范小凤在会上激昂地说：我们上海工人在中国共产党领导下，一贯站在斗争的最前列。今天为了巩固已取得的伟大胜利，我们坚决的反对侵略战争。宗教界代表吴耀宗强调地说：保卫世界和平并不是空的愿望，而要在思想斗争和行动斗争中来表现力量。过去宗教界中有许多人对帝国主义存在过幻想，但帝国主义的战争阴谋使大家觉醒了。只有粉碎这种阴谋，才能有世界持久和平与真正的幸福。科学界代表卢于道说：人民科学界的力量已很强大，原子弹吓不倒我们。大会并一致通过慰问约里奥——居里教授和戈登夫人及致美国爱好和平人民的两个电文。
    上海市各界的签名运动目前正以更广泛的规模继续展开，截至五月底，已有五十余万人签名，其中包括十五万工人及万余近郊农民。上海铁路局戚墅堰机厂工人在红五月中修复了一台机车，命名为“和平号”，于一日开抵上海，车头饰以白鸽，并用红漆漆上标语“用革命竞赛加紧铁路建设，以实际行动保卫世界和平”。
