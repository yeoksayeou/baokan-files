How the Tangshan Power Plant Created a New Coal Consumption Record

During the Red May competition at the Tangshan Power Plant, all the workers in the boiler section were the first to plunge into the competitive fervor. Everyone united and helped each other, focusing on creating a new coal consumption record. The national electricity industry conference stipulated that the annual coal consumption standard quota for the Tangshan plant was 0.58 kilograms. In May, the plant broke this standard, creating a new national record of 0.577 kilograms of coal consumption per kilowatt-hour for chain grate boilers.

Through the efforts of the workers over the past year, the Tangshan plant has thoroughly overhauled its boilers and continuously improved its technology, achieving economical combustion. In the first quarter, a record of 0.584 kilograms per kilowatt-hour was achieved, exceeding the General Administration's standard of 0.593 kilograms per kilowatt-hour. After the start of the second quarter, the workers constantly sought to break the 0.58 kilogram standard set by the national electricity industry conference, but it was not easy to achieve. Since the launch of the Red May competition, the boiler section, with the Party branch as its core, has organized competition groups. The workers of Operation Team 3 united and helped each other, carefully studying the problem, and finally created a new record. The responsible comrades of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau personally inspected and verified the record, and helped them summarize the experience of saving coal.

(1) After implementing the responsibility system, work efficiency has generally improved. In addition to maintaining the excellent tradition of diligent operation, the boiler section adjusts the coal bed and air dampers at any time according to the size of the power load. Each shift and each person also formulated a responsibility system plan, making the relationship between the shifts and sections closer. The steam turbine section properly adjusts the vacuum, and the feed water temperature is always around 97 degrees. The electrical section also makes advance contact and adjusts the cycle voltage when the load rises and falls. The coal conveying workers watered the coal evenly and appropriately. With such cooperation, coal consumption decreased day by day.

(2) The workers carefully studied and created new technical operating methods: ① When the No. 1 boiler was running independently, worker Hu Shikai experimented with opening the return air damper of the blower as little as possible when the power was stable. This not only maintained the temperature inside the furnace and prevented losses, but also reduced the load on the blower and saved electricity. ② When banking the fire, the main steam valve should be closed as late as possible, and the exhaust steam should not be released until the steam temperature drops to 240-250 degrees (if the temperature is too low, the steam turbine will be affected). ③ The direct passage door at the chimney outlet is completely closed to prevent the furnace temperature from escaping. As a result of these experiments, the coal consumption for banking the fire was reduced from more than four tons to 2.8 tons. Later, after Foreman Liu Yong's experiment, the outlet damper of the suction fan was closed tightly, and the coal consumption for banking the fire was further reduced to 2.3 tons. ④ Before banking the fire, calculate the time and water the coal in the coal hopper to make the humidity of the coal bed appropriate and save coal. These elaborate creations are a manifestation of a high degree of responsibility in the competition.

(3) The proper power dispatching by the General Administration is also related to reducing coal consumption. In the second half of the night, one boiler and one machine are stopped, so that the No. 1 machine and No. 1 boiler with higher efficiency can run independently and maintain its economical output.

(4) The Party branch truly played a fortress role; the workers were able to unite and help each other. After the boiler section branch entered the competition, it mobilized the Party members and the masses to formulate individual and team plans for implementing the responsibility system. A good atmosphere of unity, mutual assistance, and conscientious study of technology has been widely developed. Every worker operates diligently and studies and improves technology together.团员 Xu Ying found that the axle tile of the No. 1 furnace suction fan was worn due to poor oil quality, and immediately reported it to the superior for timely handling. Worker Zhang Wance, a member of the competition team's inspection committee, found that the oil ring of the suction fan was not turning during merging the furnace and corrected it immediately. The workers in the section are highly motivated, have good labor discipline, unite and help each other, have close Party-masses relations, and the leadership goes deep, which is also an important reason for saving coal.

　　唐山发电厂怎样创造煤耗新纪录
    在唐山发电厂红五月竞赛中，锅炉股全体职工首先投入竞赛热潮。大家团结互助，专心致力于创造煤耗的新纪录。全国电业会议规定唐厂全年煤耗标准定额是○·五八公斤，在五月份，该厂已突破这一标准，创造了全国炼条式锅炉煤耗○·五七七公斤的最新纪录。
    唐厂煤耗，经工友一年来的努力，彻底检修锅炉，不断改进技术，已达到经济燃烧的程度。第一季创造了每度电○·五八四公斤的纪录，超过了总局给予的每度○·五九三公斤的标准。第二季开始，职工们时刻想法突破全国电业会议规定的○·五八公斤的标准，总是不易达到。自红五月竞赛开展后，锅炉股以党的支部为核心，组织竞赛小组。运行三班团结互助，精心研究，终于创造了新纪录。并经唐山电业局负责同志亲自检查确实，帮助他们总结了这次省煤的经验。
    （一）实行负责制后，工作效率普遍提高，锅炉股除了保持过去精勤操作的优良传统，按电力负荷大小，随时调整煤层及风门外，每班每人还订出了负责制计划，使得各班各股之间的关系更加密切。汽机股真空调节适宜，给水温度始终在九十七度左右。电气股也作到在涨落负荷时，事先联络，调整周波电压等。运煤工友把煤的水份浇的均匀合适。在这样互相配合之下，煤耗逐日下降。
    （二）工人精心钻研，创造新的技操作方法：①在实行一号炉单独运术转时，工友胡世凯试验着在电力平稳时，尽量少开送风机回风门，这样，不但可以保持炉内温度，使不受损失，并且可以减轻送风机的负荷，节省电流。②压火时尽量晚关主汽门，不放乏汽、直到蒸汽温度降到二四○——二五○度时，再关主汽门（如温度过低汽机受影响）。③烟囱出口直通门完全关闭，不使炉内温度跑失。这样试验结果，使得压火用煤由四吨多降至二·八吨。后又经领班刘咏试验，把吸风机出口闸门关严，压火用煤又降至二·三吨。④压火前算准时间，在煤斗浇水，使煤床煤层湿度适当而省煤。这些精心创造，都是竞赛中高度负责的表现。
    （三）总局电力调度得当，对于减低煤耗也有关系，后半夜停止一炉一机，使效率较高的一号机一号炉单独运行，并且保持它的经济出力。
    （四）党支部真正起了堡垒作用；职工能团结互助。锅炉股支部进入竞赛后，就发动党员群众订立执行负责制的个人与全班计划。搞好团结，互助工作，虚心钻研技术的风气，已普遍展开，每个职工都精勤操作，互相研究提高技术。团员徐英发现一号炉吸风机轴瓦，因油质不好磨边，立即报告上级及时处理。工友张万策是竞赛小组检查委员，在并炉时发现吸风机油圈不转，即时改正。该股工人情绪高涨，劳动纪律好，职工团结互助，党群关系密切，领导深入，也是省煤的重要原因。（“唐电通讯”小报）
