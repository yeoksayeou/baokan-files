　　Formerly Oppressed Children Do Not Forget Chairman Mao
　　Bi Yao Cai
　　Dear Chairman Mao,
　　Now I want to tell you:
　　We were originally the suffering people,
　　Without house or land,
　　And also suffered the landlord's oppression.
　　My father carried long-term work,
　　My mother took me begging.

　　You led us peasants to stand up,
　　We were given five large rooms with tile roofs,
　　Land was divided into 13.7 mu,
　　In addition, there was a weaving machine,
　　Grain was divided into 5.7 shi,
　　And also furniture and farm tools.
　　From now on, work hard to produce and don't worry about drinking and eating,
　　I go to school to read and write.
　　Formerly oppressed children do not forget Chairman Mao,
　　Let me thank you in the "People's Garden"!

　　We are really happy to stand up,
　　Respond to the call for great production.
　　We planted eight mu of cotton,
　　Sorghum and beans, 5.7 mu,
　　Sideline occupations all depend on the weaving machine,
　　In addition, raising pigs and chickens.
　　My father said:
　　Without Chairman Mao,
　　Where would we get a weaving machine?
　　My mother said:
　　Without Chairman Mao,
　　How could we wear new cloth clothes?

　　Formerly oppressed children are really happy,
　　Formerly oppressed children really like it;
　　If we like it, what should we do?
　　Study hard and strive to be a model,
　　Learn good skills for the people,
　　Prepare to join the Children's Corps.

　　翻身儿童不忘毛主席
    毕耀彩
    亲爱的毛主席，
    现在俺要告诉你：
    俺们原是受苦的人，
    没房又没地，
    还受地主气。
    俺爸爸扛长活，
    俺娘领我要饭去。
　
     你领导俺们农民把身翻，
     俺们分了瓦房五大间，
     土地分了十三亩七，
     另外还有一架织布机，
     粮食分了五石七，
     还分了家具和农具。
     从此努力生产不愁喝和吃，
     读书认字我上学去。
     翻身的儿童不忘毛主席，
     让俺在“人民园地”上谢谢你！
　
     俺们翻身真高兴，
     响应号召大生产。
     俺们种了八亩棉，
     高粱、豆子五亩七，
     副业全凭织布机，
     另外养猪又养鸡。
     俺爸爸说：
     没有毛主席，
     俺们那来织布机？
     俺娘说：
     没有毛主席，
     俺们那能穿上新布衣？
　
     翻身的儿童真高兴，
     翻身的儿童真喜欢；
     喜欢了，怎么办？
     努力学习争模范，
     学好本领为人民，
     准备参加儿童团。
