American Military Supplies Pass Through Customs
	Compiled by Cai Yingping

　　On March 8th, the reactionary Los Angeles Times published a piece of news saying that the American Department of Defense had ordered a temporary halt to the shipment of military supplies piled up on the East Coast to Europe, waiting for the American and Western European labor traitors to carry out sabotage against the Western European dockworkers' struggle before resuming shipment.

　　As a result, the reactionary union bosses of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and other Western and Northern European countries became nervous, busily currying favor with the American plutocrats, indicating that they had solutions.

　　On March 16th, the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," led by reactionary American unions, held a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss how to "crush the Western European dockworkers' strike" and specifically decided that the General Secretary of the "International Transport Workers' Federation," Oldenbroek, would organize "strike-breaking committees" in Western European ports. After the meeting, Oldenbroek flew to Washington, D.C., assuring the American warmongers that the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" would devote all its efforts to dealing with Western European sailors and dockworkers.

　　On March 21st, seven reactionary bosses of American sailor and dockworker unions held a secret meeting in Washington, D.C., in which they declared that they would wage "hot war" against Western European dockworkers. The specific method was to spend money to hire a group of American hooligan thugs, who would sail to Western Europe, and as soon as they arrived at the port, quickly lower the gangplank, and cooperate with the troops, police, and labor traitors on the shore to unload the military supplies, thereby sabotaging the dockworkers' blockade. Joseph Ryan, chairman of the "International Longshoremen's Association," which controls ports on the American East Coast, further guaranteed to the State Department that his men would more actively load military supplies to Western Europe.

　　Things seemed to be arranged, and the American warmongers were confident that the road to Western Europe had been opened, and that they would no longer be troubled like months ago, when American military supply ships arrived in North Africa and were troubled by local dockworkers for a month before they could be unloaded. In late March, two American ships, the "Exilona" and the "American Import," loaded with military supplies, set sail for Europe, preparing to dock and unload at two "weak links" (Naples in Italy and Cherbourg in France).

　　As soon as the ships set sail, the news spread to France and Italy. The dockworkers of Naples and Cherbourg actively prepared to meet this struggle, and workers everywhere held meetings to express their support. The reactionary governments of the two countries panicked, sending large numbers of troops and police to the ports to suppress them, and the labor traitors were busy spending money to buy off dockworkers, and found some backward elements from the starving unemployed workers, preparing to rush to unload the cargo as soon as the ship docked. On the morning of March 21st, the French government arrested Frachon, the French sailor and dockworker leader and General Secretary of the International Seafarers' Union, and imprisoned him. The Italian government and the American military authorities in Italy spread false news everywhere, saying that the American ships would dock here and there, in order to confuse the people's sight.

　　When the "Exilona" sailed into the Mediterranean, it found that the situation in Naples was not good, and temporarily discussed unloading at the port of Trieste. After contacting the shore, they learned that the dockworkers in Trieste had already been waiting in full force, and would strike if they came. So, biting the bullet, they still sailed towards Naples.

　　On April 12th, when the ship approached the port, Naples had entered military administration, barbed wire with hooks was built around the docks, all the city's police were mobilized to the docks, and Rome also sent an infantry regiment and a special battalion, with bayonets fixed, escorting nine hundred dockworkers who had been obtained by various means to unload American military supplies. But the reactionaries were not reassured, and they wanted the ships to enter the port at three o'clock in the morning, and unload the military supplies from the ships secretly at night.

　　After dawn, the workers learned that the military supplies had been secretly unloaded, and they were extremely angry. The workers in Naples immediately announced an eight-hour general strike, and the workers in Turin in the north held a one-hour protest strike. Workers from all over the country and people from all walks of life wrote letters to the dockworkers in Naples to express their support. On the 12th and 13th, demonstrations and protest rallies were held all over Italy to oppose the shameless collusion of the reactionaries. The people of Genoa and Milan protested and demonstrated in front of the American consulate.

　　The encounter of another ship of military supplies troubled the American warmongers even more. Originally, the port of Cherbourg had not docked an American ship for eighteen months. This time, they wanted to take a "cold" approach and smuggle a batch of military supplies in. The French government had also secretly made some arrangements in the port in advance. A few days before the arrival of the "American Import," it sent troops to force 350 dockworkers in the port to work. Most of the workers resolutely refused. Only 105 workers reluctantly agreed under the condition that their children were about to starve to death. On the same day, when the ship approached, the French government sent two thousand troops to monitor these one hundred dockworkers to unload the military supplies, and another five hundred "Republican Security Guards" were sent to monitor the troops, to prevent them from resolutely implementing the suppression task. On average, in Cherbourg, a port where dockworker organizations were relatively weak, it took twenty soldiers and five security guards to force a worker to serve the American warmongers. The military supplies were unloaded, but the struggle was not over.

　　On April 11th, a train began to depart from Cherbourg, transporting the unloaded American military supplies to Paris. At the Batignolles station, it encountered the first obstacle: more than a hundred peace defenders lay on the tracks, preventing the train from passing. The police immediately came out and spent several hours finally getting past this obstacle, but the matter had already become big. Peace defenders along the way blew whistles and sang the Marseillaise loudly and passionately as the train passed. When it arrived at Argentan station, things became even more troublesome. All the factory workers and railway workers in the area immediately announced a strike and gathered at the station to prevent the train from moving, stopping the train for several more hours.

　　Similar struggles are spreading in ports throughout Western Europe, Northern Europe, and North Africa. Dockworkers in almost all ports in France have refused to load and unload war materials for both domestic and foreign transport. Dockworkers in all major ports and most small and medium-sized ports in Italy have also resolutely refused to unload foreign military supplies. Other major seaports such as Rotterdam and Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Antwerp and Ostend in Belgium, Copenhagen in Denmark, Hamburg and Bremen in West Germany, Oslo in Norway, Gothenburg in Sweden, and Tunis and Oran in North Africa have all been "blocked" by the heroic actions of dockworkers.

　　Even Billaud, a conservative member of the French parliament, had to lament in the French parliament: "To transport a few small tanks, we have to mobilize hundreds of Republican Security Guards. To transport some military supplies and troops to Vietnam, we have to seal off the port and gather a large number of police, gendarmes, and security guards for security. To transport a ship of military supplies from the United States, we have to keep the location of the mooring secret. How can a country like this launch a war against the Soviet Union?"

　　This is precisely the problem that the American warmongers and their lackeys are currently most distressed about.

　　美国军火过关
    蔡英平  编
    三月八日，美国反动的洛杉矶日报发表了一则消息，说美国国防部下令，暂时不把堆积在东岸的军火运往欧洲，要等美国与西欧的工贼进行破坏西欧码头工人的斗争以后，再行启运。
    于是，美、英、法、意、荷以及其它西欧、北欧的反动工会头子们，便紧张起来，忙着向美国大财阀献媚，表示他们有办法。
    三月十六日，以美国反动工会为首的“国际自由工会联合会”在比利时布鲁塞尔开会，讨论怎样“粉碎西欧码头工人的罢工”，并具体决定由“国际运输工人协会”总书记奥尔登勃鲁克在西欧各港口组织“破坏罢工委员会”。会后奥氏飞往华盛顿，向美国战争贩子保证：“国际自由工会联合会”决以全副力量来对付西欧的海员与码头工人。
    三月二十一日，七个美国海员码头工人工会的反动头子在华盛顿召开秘密会议，在会议中宣告要向西欧码头工人进行“热战”。具体办法是出钱雇一批美国流氓打手，随船开往西欧，一到港口便把跳板迅速放下，和岸上的军队、警察、工贼等配合把军火卸掉，这样来破坏码头工人的封锁。控制美国东岸港口的“国际码头工人协会”主席约瑟夫·莱恩，更向国务院保证：他的手下一定会更积极地装运军火到西欧去。
    事情似乎已经布置好了，美国战争贩子满以为通往西欧的大道已经打开，再不会像数月前，美国军火船开到北非，给当地码头工人困扰了一个月才能起卸。三月下旬，两艘美国轮船“爱克齐隆娜号”与“美国依姆波特号”装满了军火朝欧洲开去，预备在两个“薄弱的环节”（意大利的那不勒斯和法国的瑟堡港）停泊卸运。
    船一开动，消息就传到法国和意大利。那不勒斯和瑟堡的码头工人积极准备迎接这一场斗争，各地工人集会表示支援。两国的反动政府着慌了，派了大批军警到港口去镇压，工贼们也忙着出钱收买码头工人，并从饥饿的失业工人中找到一些落后分子，预备船一靠岸就赶着卸货。法国政府在三月二十一日清晨，把法国海员码头工人领袖，海员工会国际总书记弗瑞辛奈抓起来，关在监狱里。意大利政府以及美国驻意军事机关则到处散布假消息，说美国轮船将在这儿那儿停泊，以迷惑人民的视线。
    当“爱克齐隆娜号”驶入地中海时，发觉那不勒斯的形势不大妙，临时商议想到的里雅斯特港卸货。和岸上联络一下，才知道的港码头工人早已严阵以待，要来就罢工。于是硬着头皮，还是朝那不勒斯驶去。
    四月十二日，当船靠近港口时，那不勒斯已进入军事管理状态，码头四周筑起了带钩的铁丝网，全市警察都动员到码头去，罗马还派来一个步兵团和一个特别营，上了刺刀，押着九百个用各种办法弄来的码头工人去卸运美国军火。但是反动派还不放心，还要船只在清晨三点钟进港，在夜里偷偷摸摸地把船上的军火卸掉。
    天亮后，工人们得悉军火已被偷偷地卸下，异常忿怒，那不勒斯全市工人立即宣布八小时总罢工，北部都灵市工人举行一小时抗议大罢工，各地工人和各阶层人民纷纷写信给那不勒斯码头工人表示支援。十二、十三两日，全意大利各地举行游行示威和抗议大会，反对反动派的无耻勾当，热那亚和米兰的人民并在美国领事馆前抗议示威。
    另一船军火的遭遇更令美国战争贩子烦恼。本来瑟堡港已经有十八个月没有停泊过美国船，这次是想来个“冷门”，偷运一批军火进来。法国政府事前也在该港暗暗地作了些布置，待“美国依姆波特号”到达前几天，它派了军队强迫港口三百五十个码头工人，要他们干，大部分工人都坚决拒绝，只有一百零五个工人在自己的孩子差不多要饿死的状况下，才忍痛答应下来。当天，船靠近时，法国政府派了二千名军队监视着这一百多个码头工人去卸军火，另外又派了五百名“共和国保安队”去监视军队，以防他们不坚决执行镇压的任务。平均起来，在瑟堡这样码头工人组织得比较脆弱的港口，却需要二十个兵士和五个保安队员来迫使一个工人为美国战争贩子服务。军火是卸下来了，但斗争还未结束。
    四月十一日，一辆火车开始从瑟堡出发，把卸下的美国军火运往巴黎去，在巴第诺站碰到第一关，一百多个和平保卫者躺在车轨上不让火车通过。宪警马上出动，花了几个钟点总算过了这一关，但事情已经闹大，沿路的和平保卫者当火车经过时，便吹起汽笛，高声激昂地唱马赛曲。到了亚根丹站，事情更麻烦。所有该地的工厂工人和铁路工人立即宣布罢工，集合在车站上不让火车开动，阻止车运又有几小时之久。
    类似的斗争弥漫在西欧、北欧与北非各港口。法国差不多全部港口的码头工人已拒绝装卸内外运的战争物资，意大利所有大的港口以及大部分中、小港口的码头工人，也同样坚决地不卸运外来的军火武器，其它像荷兰的鹿特丹和阿姆斯特丹，比利时的安特卫普和奥斯登特，丹麦的哥本哈根，西德的汉堡和不来梅，挪威的奥斯陆，瑞典的哥德堡，以及北非的突尼斯和奥兰等主要海港，都被码头工人的英勇行动“封锁”起来。
    就连法国的保守议员比洛，也不得不在法国议会中这样哀鸣：“要运几辆小坦克，我们就要动员数以百计的共和国保安队员。要运一些军火与军队到越南去，我们就要把港口封锁起来，集合大批警察、宪兵和保安队进行警卫。要从美国运来一船军火，我们就要保守停泊地点的秘密。像这样的国家，怎样能对苏联发动战争呢？”
    这正是使美国战争贩子和其走狗目前最感到苦恼的一个问题。
