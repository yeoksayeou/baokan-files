[Report from our Fengtai correspondent] The Fengtai Locomotive Depot and Engineering Depot of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, under the direct leadership and assistance of the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union of China, signed their second quarterly collective contracts on May 3rd and 15th, respectively. The basic spirit of the contracts is: to implement democratic management based on the principle of considering both public and private interests, to strengthen the unity between the administration and the trade union, and to ensure that both parties complete and strive to exceed production and transportation tasks. The contracts require conscientious efforts to improve quality, reduce costs, gradually improve labor protection, and ensure the safety of workers and the appropriate improvement of their lives. These are the first batch of collective contracts signed within the customs after the resolution of the "Implementation Outline for Concluding Collective Contracts in National Railway Enterprises" was passed by the National Railway Trade Union Congress in February this year.

The preparatory work for the signing of the contracts began in March of this year. After a month or two of full preparation, the contracts were formally signed. The contract content specifically stipulates the production plan, quality standards, labor discipline, welfare facilities, reward and punishment methods, and the responsibilities to be borne by both the administration and the trade union. In order to resolve disputes between workers and the administration regarding the implementation of the collective contract, the contract stipulates that a mediation committee shall be organized by the administration and the trade union based on the principle of equality.

At the beginning of the contract signing process, both administrative cadres and workers at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot had some ideological concerns: the administration was afraid that the contract would not be guaranteed to be realized; the workers were afraid that the tasks could not be completed on time due to insufficient machinery and equipment, unfixed production tasks, and untimely supply of materials. After repeated discussions and studies, everyone realized that the existing difficulties could be overcome. At this time, both parties drafted contract drafts separately. On the administrative side, the director, foreman, and technically skilled workers, based on the tasks and standards for the second quarter, as well as the figures completed in the first quarter and the opinions of the workers, divided into several groups such as operation, factory, and technology, to draft administrative task standards. On the trade union side, committee members, employee representatives, and party and league responsible comrades, under the guidance of the higher-level party and trade union, drafted the responsibilities and requirements of the trade union. The draft contracts of both parties were jointly studied and revised, discussed and passed by the Management Committee, sent to the Bureau and District Trade Union for review, and then discussed at the employee representative meeting, where they were unanimously approved. The administration and the trade union officially signed on the 3rd.

Before signing the contract, the Engineering Depot conducted on-site tests and mobilized workers to discuss and find the correct work rate and production quota, laying the technical foundation for the collective contract. The new work rate and quota are generally 20% to 50% higher than the old standards. The contract stipulates a work acceptance system and acceptance standards. When the quality of work (or products) exceeds the qualified standard, bonuses are calculated on a progressive basis. In the event of a liability accident, 5% to 20% of the completed task will be deducted according to the size of the accident. If a unit fails to complete the task, it will be recorded as debt and must be repaid in the next contract period.

After the contract was signed, every employee knew their production responsibilities, output, and quality standards. The goals were clarified, which facilitated the mobilization of the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. Track maintenance worker Wang Chengfu said, "In the past, we worked haphazardly. Now we have a direction." (Liu Lin, Yao Ke)

　　丰台机务段工务段分别签订集体合同
    确定行政方面和工会的责任，保证完成任务。
    【本报丰台讯】在中国铁路工会全国委员会的直接领导与帮助下，天津铁路局丰台机务段和工务段，分别在五月三日及十五日签订了第二季集体合同。合同的基本精神是：依据公私兼顾的原则，贯彻民主管理，加强行政与工会的团结，由双方保证完成并争取超过生产及运输任务。要求认真提高质量，降低成本，逐步改进劳动保护，保障职工安全及生活之适当改善。这是今年二月全国铁路工会代表大会通过“在全国铁路企业中订立集体合同实施纲领”的决议后在关内签订的第一批集体合同。
    订立合同的酝酿工作，从今年三月即已开始。经过一两个月的充分准备，始正式签订。合同内容具体地规定了生产计划、质量标准、劳动纪律、福利设施、奖惩办法以及行政和工会双方应负的责任。为解决职工与行政关于执行集体合同时发生的纠纷，合同中规定：由行政及工会根据平等原则，组织调解委员会。
    丰台机务段在订立合同之初，行政干部和工人都有某些思想顾虑：行政上怕订了合同不能保证实现；工人害怕由于机械设备不够，生产任务不固定，材料供给不及时，到期完不成任务。经过反复讨论研究，大家都认识了目前存在的困难，是可以克服的。这时，双方分别起草合同草案。行政方面，由主任、工长及技术好的工人，根据第二季度的任务、标准，及第一季度已完成的数字和工人的意见，分成运转、工厂、技术等几个小组，起草行政任务标准。工会方面，由委员、职工代表及党、团负责同志，在上级党和工会指导下，起草工会的责任和要求。双方的合同草案，经过共同研究删改，由管委会讨论通过、送管理局、区工会审查，再在职工代表会上讨论，获得一致的通过。行政、工会双方，即于三日正式签字。
    工务段在签订合同前，先进行现场测验，并发动工友讨论，找出了正确的工率和生产定额。给集体合同打下技术方面的基础。新的工率和定额，一般均较旧的标准提高百分之二十至百分之五十。合同中规定了工作验收制度和验收标准。在工作（或产品）质量超过合格标准时，按超额累进计奖。发生责任事故时，按事故大小扣去所完成任务的百分之五至百分之二十。如某单位未能完成任务，要记欠账，并在下期合同内还清。
    订立合同后，每个职工都晓得自己所担负的生产责任、产量与质量标准。明确了奋斗目标，便于发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性。养路工人王成富说：“过去我们工作东一耙子，西一扫帚，这回有了方向了。” （柳林·姚克）
