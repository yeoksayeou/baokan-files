　　People's Bank of Zhangjiakou Branches Support Private Fur Industry with Loans
    [Zhangjiakou News] To help private industrial and commercial enterprises overcome temporary difficulties, from mid-May to May 25th, the branches of the People's Bank of Zhangjiakou issued a total of 983.8 million yuan in various loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises, accounting for 72.1% of the total amount lent. Most industries have become more active. The recipients of the loans included more than ten industries, such as: fur, raw hides, fur clothing, flour, oil pressing, construction, sundries, hardware and electrical materials, egg processing, stationery printing, and transportation. After seventeen fur businesses received loans of 652 million yuan, they went to Baotou, Wuyuan, Shanba and other places to purchase wool and cashmere for export to Tianjin. For example, Zhangjiakou Ruichengxiang has already shipped more than 32,770 catties of wool to Tianjin through bank exchange. At present, the overseas sales of wool and cashmere are very good, and with the strong support of the bank, the development prospects are estimated to be extremely optimistic. After seven raw hide businesses received bank loans of 47 million yuan, they began to purchase old sheepskins in Chahar Province to make leather jackets. Ruichangyong Fur Clothing borrowed 3 million yuan and expects to produce 120 more lambskin mattresses. Eighteen fur clothing businesses are expected to produce 1,800 more lambskin mattresses. Twenty-four flour businesses received a total of more than 120 million yuan in loans. After three sundries businesses borrowed 10 million yuan, they combined private capital to buy 30 large barrels of sesame oil from Tianjin. Because of the good quality, the sales are also good.
    After obtaining bank loans, some industries have become active, and the money supply in the market has also eased compared with before. In particular, the fur industry, since the opening of overseas sales in May, the trafficking activities have been incessant. Recently, the number of individual peddlers coming to Zhangjiakou from Chahar Province and western Suiyuan has been no less than 70 or 80 people per day, each carrying 50 or 60 catties; in addition, large merchants carrying tens of thousands of catties are also active. From the purchase quantity of Zhangjiakou Fur Company, the active situation is even more obvious. The company purchased only more than 120,000 catties of wool in April, but as of May 25th, it has purchased 250,000 catties, accounting for about 75% of the city's total purchase volume.

　　人民银行张市各行处
    贷款扶植私营皮毛业
    【本报张家口讯】人民银行张市各行、处为扶助私营工商业度过暂时困难，自五月中旬至五月二十五日止，对私营工商业共发放各种贷款九亿八千三百余万元，占总贷出额的百分之七二·一，大部分行业已转趋活跃。获得贷款者有：皮毛、粗皮、皮裘、面粉、榨油、建筑、杂货、五金电料、蛋品加工、文具印刷、运输等十余行业。皮毛业十七户获得贷款六亿五千二百万元后，即纷赴包头、五原、陕坝等地采购绒毛，输往天津出口。如张市瑞成祥通过银行押汇即已运津羊毛三万二千七百七十余斤。目前绒毛国外销路甚好，加以银行大力扶植，估计发展前途极为乐观。粗皮业七户经银行贷款四千七百万元后，已开始到察北等地收购老羊皮制做皮袄。皮裘业瑞昌永借款三百万元后，预计可多做羔皮褥一百二十条，十八户皮裘业预计可多做羔皮褥一千八百条。面粉业二十四户，共得贷款一亿二千多万元。杂货业三户贷款一千万元后，结合私资从天津买回麻油三十大桶，因质量好，销路亦好。
    各业经银行贷款后，部分行业已活跃起来，市面银根亦较前松动。特别是皮毛业，自五月份国外销路打开后，贩运活动川流不息，最近由察北及绥西来张的单人小贩，每日即不下七、八十人，每人背五六十斤；另外，上万斤的大商贩亦形活跃。从张市皮毛公司的收购数量看，活跃情况更加明显。该公司在四月份收购羊毛仅十二万余斤，五月份截至二十五日止即已收购了二十五万斤，约占全市收购量百分之七十五。
