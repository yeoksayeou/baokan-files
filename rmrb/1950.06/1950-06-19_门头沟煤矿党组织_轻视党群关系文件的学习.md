Mentougou Coal Mine Party Organization Disregards the Study of Documents on Party-Masses Relations
    Jin Sha
    Two Different Situations
    The Mentougou Mining Committee (Party Committee) wrote this in its summary report to the Beijing Municipal Party Committee on the study of documents on the unity and cooperation between Party members and non-Party masses: "First, the spirit of these three documents was conveyed in the Party branches, and studied within the Party. Then, the study committee divided the staff into study groups according to their work units (including Party member staff) for study. A fixed study time was set every day. The study steps were: reading the documents, self-study, informal discussions, small group deliberations, and then collective discussions, combined with the actual situation of the mine, and then putting forward opinions on the branches and Party members, in order to achieve further unity between the Party and the masses. However, in the process of study, because the Party organizations of each mine did not pay enough attention to the study...they did not combine it with the thoughts of the Party members and the specific facts of the past for discussion, so the study was not deep enough. At the study discussion meeting, the Party members failed to play a leading role (?), so the masses did not speak enthusiastically...nor did they make deep self-criticisms."
    However, according to a Party member from the staff branch of the Mentougou Mine: "Our branch's study of these three documents was like this: One day (May 7th), I had just gotten up when the general branch notified me to attend a meeting. I asked, 'What meeting is it?' Someone said, 'A meeting on Party-masses relations.' At the meeting, General Branch Secretary Zhang Zhan was making a self-criticism. In addition to a few Party members, there were also non-Party members, such as: Mine Director Zhang Shiming, Engineer Feng Zhendong, Coal Mining Section Chief Niu Jiwu, and Disbursement Section Chief Li Su. After Comrade Zhang Zhan made his self-criticism, Union Chairman Wang Shuxue and others also made self-criticisms. Then the non-Party members raised a few points and the meeting adjourned. At the time, I was very puzzled as to why such a head-scratching meeting was convened, so I wrote a note to ask the branch secretary. The branch secretary replied: 'Because the Municipal Party Committee asked us for a summary report on the study of documents on the unity and cooperation between Party members and non-Party masses, we had to convene such a meeting temporarily.'"
    Can a Single Meeting Solve the Problem?
    The facts are as follows:
    The Mentougou Mine is the largest coal mine of the Jingxi Coal Mining Company, and the focus of various tasks is also on this mine. The summary report on the study of the three documents this time was also mainly based on the summary report of the Mentougou Mine General Branch.
    After the Mentougou Mining Committee and the Mentougou Mine General Branch received the Municipal Party Committee's April 14th notice on studying the three documents, they did not, as written in the study summary report, "First convey the spirit of these three documents at the Party branch meeting," but did not solemnly convey and deploy it. However, the General Branch Secretary of Mentougou Coal Mine disagreed, saying, "We made a formal deployment after receiving the Municipal Party Committee's notice." And he introduced the reporter to the general branch to investigate this matter. But according to the secretary of the Mentougou Coal Mine General Branch: there was a notice, but he couldn't remember the date of the notice, it was about March. And he enthusiastically flipped out the general branch's work report for March, saying: The situation of studying the three documents is discussed here. In fact, the central government's three documents were issued on March 25th, and the Municipal Party Committee's notice was issued in mid-April.
    The reporter also interviewed the person in charge of the office study committee introduced by the General Branch Secretary. He said that the three documents were only studied after May 8th. The reporter also interviewed a few Party members in the Mentougou Coal Mine Trade Union and the mine office, and they all told the reporter the same thing.
    When the Municipal Party Committee urged the Mining Committee to submit the study summary, the Mining Committee urged the General Branch to submit the summary, and the General Branch urged the Branch to submit the summary. The Branch had to temporarily convene a study discussion meeting with Party members and non-Party members. A major branch of Mentougou Coal Mine (namely the staff branch) considered that it had "studied" the three documents and "inspected" Party-masses relations in a meeting lasting no more than two or three hours. After the meeting, the branch reported this to the General Branch; the General Branch reported this to the Mining Committee; and the Mining Committee sent the study summary report to the Municipal Party Committee on May 10th.
    The Party Organization Adopted a Completely Perfunctory Attitude Towards This Study
    After the meeting, according to a comrade from the Mining Committee, the staff branch of Mentougou Mine stopped studying the three documents because of busy work. But as the reporter knows, the main reason: lies in the fact that the leading comrades of the Party organization of Mentougou Coal Mine are satisfied with the current state of Party-masses relations. For example, they said: "Although it's not very good, it's still okay." This is the fundamental reason for neglecting the study of the three documents.
    However, in departments where non-Party members account for more than 90%, the Party organization of Mentougou Coal Mine formally deployed this study. And the non-Party members saw clearly in the documents that Party members were required to "seriously study and conduct self-criticism accordingly," so they also adopted a perfunctory attitude. Comrade Li Su, a non-Party member who led this study, said: "Everyone has opinions, but they dare not speak, they are unwilling to speak. They always adopt a perfunctory attitude. For example, they say: 'The Communist Party is very good, all the policies are very good.' Almost everyone says this. When you ask them urgently, they answer: 'Ah, I haven't considered it yet!' 'I'll talk about it later!' This is how we studied for ten days."
    When the reporter asked the General Branch Secretary of Mentougou Coal Mine why he did this, he said: "This is not intentionally asking non-Party members to study while Party members do not study, it is entirely because a study system has already been established among non-Party members, so we studied this document."
    Looking at Party-Masses Relations from One Thing
    Finally, it is necessary to introduce what the relationship between the Party and the non-Party masses in Mentougou Coal Mine actually is.
    Here, we can take a look at the situation of the Party-masses relationship in Mentougou from the problem of the existence of the "foreman system." The Mentougou "foreman system" has been exploiting workers for a long time. But the Party in Mentougou Coal Mine did not know about it. Or perhaps they knew about it but did not dare to solve it. After the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government issued a circular on "abolishing the foreman system" in March, the Party in Mentougou neither quickly mobilized the workers to rise up against the foremen, nor did it suggest that the administration abolish the "foreman system" from top to bottom. The worker masses also did not dare to appeal to the Party about their suffering. The Party organization of Mentougou turned a deaf ear to the great suffering of the workers. Isn't this a serious detachment from the worker masses? Even more serious is that some foremen were mixed into the Party, continuing their evil deeds. The case of foreman Dong Xigeng is one example. He sold laborers during the Japanese puppet regime, opened a contracting counter during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and continued to deduct workers' wages and suppress workers after liberation. It is said that he had "lost" his organizational ties, but they were restored after liberation without strict review. As a result, he was able to act lawlessly within the Party and continue to split the unity of the Party and the workers. It was not until the anti-foreman movement began this time that Dong Xigeng was expelled from the Party.
    The correct assessment should be like this: The Party-masses relationship in Mentougou Coal Mine seems to be "okay" and without problems on the surface, but in fact the Party organization is detached from the masses to some extent. The problem of the foreman system is a good example. And neglecting the study of documents on mass relations will prevent this situation from being improved quickly.

　　门头沟煤矿党组织  轻视党群关系文件的学习
    金沙
    两种不同情况
    门头沟矿委会（党委会）在给北京市委的学习党员与非党群众团结合作的文件的总结报告上这样写着：“首先在党支部上传达了这三个文件的精神，在党内学习。再由学习委员会把职员按工作单位分为学习组（党员职员在内）进行学习。每天定出了学习时间。学习步骤是：念文件，自习，漫谈，小组酝酿，再集体讨论，结合矿场实际情况，再提出对支部和党员的意见，以达到党群之间的进一步团结。但是在学习过程中，由于各矿党的组织对学习抓的不够紧……并未结合党员的思想和过去具体事实进行讨论，以致学习不够深刻。在学习讨论会上，党员未能起带头作用（？），所以群众发言也不热烈，……也未作深刻的检讨。”
    但是，据门头沟矿工作人员分支部一个党员来谈：“我们支部对于这三个文件的学习情形是这样的：有一天（五月七日），我刚起床，总支来通知开会。我问‘开什么会？’有人说：‘开党群关系会’。到会场，总支书记张栴同志正在作自我检讨。会上除了少数党员外，还有非党员，如：矿长张世铭、工程师凤振东、采煤股长牛继武、出纳股长李苏。在张栴同志检讨以后，并有工会主任王树学同志等检讨。随后非党员提了几点意见，就散会了。当时我很奇怪为什么召开这样没头没尾的会议，所以就写条子去问分支书记。分支书记答复：‘因为市委向我们要学习党员与非党群众团结合作文件的总结报告，因此不得不临时召开这样的会议。’”
    一个会议就能解决问题吗？
    事实是如此：
    门头沟矿是京西煤矿公司最大的一个煤矿，各种工作的重点也就在这个矿场。此次学习三个文件的总结报告，也主要根据门头沟矿总支的总结报告写出来的。
    当门头沟矿委员会和门头沟矿总支部在接到市委四月十四日关于学习三个文件的通知后，并不是像学习总结报告中所写的：“首先在党支部大会上传达了这三个文件的精神”，而是并未郑重的传达布置。但是，门头沟煤矿总支书是不同意的，他说：“我们在接到市委通知后，曾作过正式布置的。”并介绍记者去总支部调查这件事情。但据门头沟煤矿总支部秘书谈：曾有过通知，可是已记不起通知的日期，大约是三月份。并热心的翻出总支部三月份工作汇报说：这里边就谈到了学习三个文件的情形。事实上中央的三个文件是三月二十五日发布的，市委的通知则是四月半发出的。
    记者又访问过总支书所介绍的办公室学习委员会负责同志。说是在五月八日以后才学习这三个文件。又访问过门头沟煤矿工会与矿厂办公室少数党员，也都这样告诉了记者。
    在市委督促矿委会交学习总结时，矿委会就向总支部催交总结，总支部又催分支部交总结。分支部不得不临时召集党员与非党员开学习讨论会。门头沟煤矿一个主要分支部（即工作人员支部）在一个不过两三小时的会议上，就算是“学习”了三个文件，“检查”了党群关系。会议后，这个分支部就向总支部报告；总支部将此向矿委会报告；矿委会则于五月十日向市委会送出了学习总结报告。
    党组织对这次学习完全采取了应付态度
    会议后，据矿委会一位同志谈，门头沟矿工作人员分支部因为工作繁忙，停止了对三个文件的学习。但据记者所知，主要的原因：还在于门头沟煤矿的党组织的领导同志，满足于现在的党群关系状况。如说：“虽然不十分好，但还可以。”这就是轻视学习三个文件的根本原因。
    但是，在非党人员占百分之九十以上的部门，门头沟煤矿党组织却又正式布置了这一学习。而非党员在看到了文件中明明是要党员“认真加以学习，并据以进行检讨”，所以，他们也就采取了应付态度。领导这一学习的非党员李苏同志就这样谈：“大家是有意见的，但是不敢说，不愿说。总是采取应付的态度。如说：‘共产党很好，各种政策都很好。’几乎每一个人都是这样说。当你问急了，他就答：‘啊，我还没考虑！’‘以后再说！’就这样学习了十天。”
    当记者询问门头沟煤矿总支书为什么这样作呢？他说：“这并不是有意叫非党员学习而党员不学习，完全是因为在非党人员中已经建立起了学习制度，所以学习了这个文件。”
    从一件事情来看党群关系
    最后必须介绍一下门头沟煤矿党与非党群众的关系究竟是怎样。
    这里可以从“把头制”存在的问题来看一看门头沟党与群众的关系情形。门头沟“把头制”是长期地剥削着工人。但是门头沟煤矿的党是不知道的。或则知道了也不敢来解决的。当中央人民政府燃料工业部在三月发出“废除把头制度”的通令后，门头沟的党既没有迅速发动工人起来反对把头，又没有建议行政上自上而下来取缔“把头制”。工人群众也不敢向党申诉自己的痛苦。门头沟党组织，对工人这样大的痛苦不闻不问，这不是严重的脱离了工人群众吗？更严重的却是党内竟被某些把头混了进来，继续其为非作歹。把头董西更就是一例。在日伪统治时期贩卖过劳工，国民党反动统治时期开过包工柜，解放后仍继续克扣工人工资，压制工人。据说他是“失掉”了组织关系的，而在解放后并未严格审查就恢复了关系。以致他能够在党内横行不法，继续分裂党和工人的团结。直到这次反把头运动开始后，才把董西更清除出党去。
    正确的估计应当是这样的：门头沟煤矿的党群关系，从表面上看好像是“可以”而没有问题的，但是实际上党组织在某种程度上是脱离群众的，把头制的问题就是一个很好的例子。而忽视群众关系文件学习的结果，则将使这种情况不能迅速地得到改善。
