　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th. Syngman Rhee's clique is doing everything possible to obstruct the North and South Korean representatives from holding a joint conference. According to the Korean Central News Agency, since June 9th, police outposts have been strengthened throughout South Korea, and all police officers have been ordered to prevent people from crossing the 38th parallel by all means, and to closely monitor residents, especially leaders of political parties and social organizations.
　　According to the South Korean "Hankook" News Agency, the day after the Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front broadcast its call for peaceful unification to South Korea, the "United Nations Commission on Korea," a tool of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea, dispatched its military observers, Pitts and Lanqing, to "a certain location" on the 38th parallel on the 9th to discuss "military supervision issues" with the Syngman Rhee bandit troops stationed there. When three representatives of the Fatherland Front arrived at Yoryeon Station near the 38th parallel on the 10th, they were subjected to fierce bombardment by the Syngman Rhee bandit troops.

    正严密监视防止人民越过“三八线”
    【新华社平壤十九日电】李承晚集团正千方百计地阻挠南北朝鲜的代表召开联席会议。据朝鲜中央通讯社消息：南朝鲜各地自六月九日起已加强警察岗哨，所有警官已奉命以一切方法防止人们越过北纬三十八度，并严密监视居民，尤其是政党及社会团体的领袖。
    又据南朝鲜“韩国”通讯社消息：在朝鲜祖国统一战线向南朝鲜广播了和平统一号召的第二天，美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的工具“联合国朝鲜委员会”即派遣其军事监视员皮茨及蓝庆二人于九日前往三八线“某地”，与当地李承晚匪军接洽“军事监视问题”。当祖国战线的三位代表于十日到达三八线附近的砺砚站时，即遭到李承晚匪军枪炮的猛烈轰击。
