Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th: Since the national price stabilization, the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands, and the arrival of spring tea and spring cocoons on the market, the Hangzhou market has shifted from a state of stagnation to increasing activity, with the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas flourishing daily.

The sales of daily necessities and production materials needed by farmers have seen a significant increase. After selling tea and cocoons, farmers immediately buy back large quantities of essential goods. The most notable increase in sales is in textiles. The privately-owned Zhenye Dyeing and Weaving Factory's average daily sales of cloth were 8.5 bolts in April, but from May 15th to 25th, the average daily sales increased to over 52 bolts. Grain transactions have also increased substantially. The Zhejiang Grain Company's sales of rice in Hangzhou during the five days from May 22nd to 26th were 182% of the total for the five days from May 2nd to 6th. The Zhejiang Native Produce Company's retail department's total turnover on May 26th reached 40.9 million yuan; most of the goods sold were alum, cooking oil, and brown sugar needed by farmers. The Qiaozhan and Qianjiang service stations of the Hangzhou City Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer in the ten days from May 17th to 27th. The kerosene sales volume of the Zhejiang Department Store in late May nearly doubled compared to mid-May.

Due to the increasing activity in urban and rural transactions, the remittance between Hangzhou and other regions has greatly increased. According to statistics from the Zhejiang Branch of the People's Bank of China, the total amount of remittances from Hangzhou to various parts of the province and from various parts of the province to Hangzhou in the five days from May 19th to 24th (May 21st was a Sunday) increased by more than twofold compared to the five days from May 2nd to 6th. Remittances from Hangzhou to Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, tea and cocoon producing areas, have also greatly increased.

　　杭州市场转趋活跃  城乡物资交流日畅
    【新华社上海十日电】杭州市场在全国物价稳定、舟山群岛解放和春茶春茧上市以来，已由沉寂转趋活跃，城乡物资交流日畅。
    为农民所需的日常生活用品和生产资料的销路，已有显著的增加。农民于出售茶、茧后，即买回大批必需品。销路增加最显著的是布匹。私营振业染织厂四月份每天平均销售布匹八匹半，五月十五日至二十五日每天平均销售数已增加到五十二匹以上。粮食交易也已大量增加，浙江粮食公司五月二十二日至二十六日五天内在杭州卖出的食米，为五月二日至六日五天总数的百分之一百八十二。浙江土产公司门市部五月二十六日的营业总额达四千零九十万元；售出的货物大部是农民所需要的明矾、食油、红糖等。杭州市供销合作总社憩站、钱江两个服务社，五月十七日至二十七日十天内卖出肥田粉二万多斤。浙江百货公司的煤油销售量五月下旬比中旬增加几及一倍。
    由于城乡交易的日趋活跃，杭州与各地间的汇兑大见增加。据人民银行浙江分行统计：五月十九日至二十四日的五天中（五月二十一日是星期日），由杭州汇至全省各地与由全省各地汇至杭州的汇款总额，比五月二日至六日的五天均增加了二倍以上。由杭州汇到产茶和产茧区的绍兴、嘉兴、湖州的款项也都大有增加。
