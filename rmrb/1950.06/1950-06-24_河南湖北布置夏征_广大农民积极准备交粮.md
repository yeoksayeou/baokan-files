　　Henan and Hubei Arrange Summer Grain Collection
    Broad Masses of Peasants Actively Prepare to Hand Over Grain

    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 22nd] The People's Governments of Henan and Hubei provinces are arranging this year's summer grain collection work. The Henan Provincial People's Government issued instructions on summer grain collection at the end of May, and determined that the collection of summer public grain is the central task of governments at all levels in the province in July. Since the beginning of June, the special districts of Huaiyang, Chenliu, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou in the province have successively held cadre meetings to arrange the summer grain collection work. These meetings emphasized the need to resolutely implement the Central People's Government's policy on summer grain collection, mobilize peasants to investigate hidden land, properly assess yields, and prevent the occurrence of coercive commandism in the work of collecting public grain. After the cadres went to the countryside, they widely publicized the people's government's agricultural tax policy through villagers' meetings, blackboards, and other means. They also discussed how to implement reasonable collection in the summer grain collection through people's representatives' meetings and peasant representatives' meetings. Regions that have completed land reform and undergone rent reduction have also made specific regulations based on the principle of "whoever cultivates it harvests it, whoever harvests it bears the burden." All regions have also established collection committees at the county, district, and township levels, and the broad masses of peasants are actively preparing to pay public grain. For example, at a meeting of peasant representatives from more than 60 districts and townships in Chenliu Special District, representatives proposed that this year's public grain delivery must guarantee "fast, early, good, dry, clean, and full." Chenliu Special District has also repaired old granaries and built five new large warehouses, which can hold one million catties of public grain. Various places are now conducting key experiments in summer grain collection, and collection will begin soon.
    The Hubei Provincial People's Government has also issued specific measures for summer grain collection. Cadres in various counties of the province have also studied the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on summer grain collection. Huanggang, Wuchang, Jingmen, Tianmen and other counties have deployed the summer grain collection work to districts and townships through cadre meetings and people's representatives' meetings at all levels. Working cadres and the peasant masses at all levels have great confidence in completing the summer grain collection in a short period. The people's governments of Hanyang, Mianyang and other counties have also proposed to strive to complete the warehousing task in early July.

　　河南湖北布置夏征
    广大农民积极准备交粮
    【新华社汉口二十二日电】河南、湖北两省人民政府正布置今年夏季公粮的征收工作。河南省人民政府已于五月底发布夏征工作指示，并确定征收夏季公粮为全省各级政府七月份中心任务。自六月初起，该省淮阳、陈留、洛阳、郑州等专区都已先后召开干部会议，布置夏征工作。这些会议强调了必须坚决执行中央人民政府关于夏征公粮的政策，发动农民清查黑田，评好产量，防止征收公粮工作中的强迫命令的作风的发生。各地干部下乡后，又通过村民大会、黑板报等种种方式，广泛宣传人民政府的农业税政策，并通过各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议，讨论了如何在夏征中贯彻合理征收等问题。已经完成土地改革和经过减租的地区，也根据谁种谁收谁负担的原则，作出了具体的规定。各地并成立了县、区、乡各级征收委员会，广大农民均正积极准备交纳公粮。如陈留专区六十多个区乡农民代表会上，代表们提出今年交公粮一定保证“快、早、好、干、净、饱”。陈留专区并已整修了旧粮仓和新建了五个大仓，可容公粮一百万斤，各地现正作夏征重点实验，不久即可开征。
    湖北省人民政府亦已发布夏征具体办法。该省各县干部并学习了中央人民政府政务院关于夏征公粮的决定。黄冈、武昌、荆门、天门等县已通过干部会和各界人民代表会议，将夏征工作布置到区、乡。各级工作干部和农民群众对于短期内完成夏征信心极高。汉阳、沔阳等县人民政府并已提出争取在七月上旬即完成入仓任务。
