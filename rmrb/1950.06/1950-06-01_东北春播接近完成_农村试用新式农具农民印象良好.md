Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 30th: Spring sowing of major crops in Northeast China's rural areas is more than half completed and is expected to be finished by early June. In coastal and Liao River basin areas, sorghum, soybeans, corn and other crops were planted in mid-April, and early planting areas have already turned into a green expanse. In southern Rehe Province, 80 percent of arable land has been planted, and in the north, 50 percent has been planted. Wheat sowing in all provinces of Northeast China was also completed before the end of April. According to statistics from Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin provinces and the suburbs of Shenyang, the area sown with wheat this year is approximately 6.6 million mu, an increase of more than 300,000 mu compared to last year. Cotton and hemp sowing were completed in mid-May according to the original planned area (4.17 million mu for cotton fields and 314,000 mu for hemp). As of May 20, Liaoxi Province had planted more than 1.5 million mu of cotton, exceeding the original plan by more than 150,000 mu, more than double that of last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 30th: During this year's spring plowing in Northeast China's rural areas, thirteen types (totaling more than 3,300 units) of new mechanical farm implements were systematically trialed, spreading a good impression among the peasants. Most of these new farm implements were distributed to state-owned farms, demonstration farms, and leased by provincial cultivation stations to peasants for trial use. At the same time, the Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the agricultural and forestry departments of various provinces selected more than 40 mutual aid teams with relatively good foundations throughout the Northeast region and provided them with a full set of new mechanical farm implements for trial use. During this year's spring plowing, these mutual aid teams, under the guidance of technicians dispatched by the People's Government, widely used eight types of mechanical farm implements, such as seed selectors, double-wheeled single-blade plows, disc harrows, and seeders. The efficiency of cultivation was three to five times higher than that of the original old farm implements, and the sowing was even, the soil was properly cultivated, and the emergence of sown crops was also neat and robust. For example, two mutual aid teams headed by peasants Liu Bingli and He Fengshan in Yushu County, Jilin Province, used two seeders to plant 510 mu of sorghum and soybeans in eleven and a half days, saving more than 140 man-days and more than 110 horse-days compared to using old farm implements in previous years. Wang Zhentang's mutual aid team in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, used a seeder for sowing, with two people and four horses planting 40 mu of land per day, saving seven man-days and eight horse-days compared to using the old plow; and because the sowing was even, more than 30 jin of seeds were saved per ten mu of land. Huang Yongde's mutual aid team in Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, used a double-wheeled single-blade plow to reclaim wasteland, saving about eight man-days and 35 horse-days for every ten mu of reclaimed land compared to using the old plow.

The effect of the trial use of new mechanical farm implements in various places has given a very good impression to the broad masses of peasants. When the mutual aid teams were trying them out, nearby peasants came in groups to visit, admiring the efficiency of the new farm implements and expressing their intention to use them next year. The peasants who have already used the new farm implements have further strengthened their confidence. They are working hard to learn the technology in order to better use and master various new farm implements.

　　东北春播接近完成
    农村试用新式农具农民印象良好
    【新华社沈阳三十日电】东北农村主要农作物的春播工作，已完成一半以上，六月初即可全部完成。沿海及辽河流域地区高粱、大豆、玉米等作物四月中旬即已种完，早种地区已成一片绿野。热河省南部耕地已种完百分之八十，北部亦已种完百分之五十。全东北各省小麦播种在四月底前亦已完成。据黑龙江、松江、辽东、辽西、吉林五省及沈阳市郊的统计，今年种麦约六百六十万亩，较去年增加三十余万亩。棉、麻播种均已于五月中旬按原计划面积（棉田四百十七万亩，麻三十一万四千亩）完成，辽西省截至五月二十日已种棉一百五十万余亩，超过原计划十五万余亩，比去年多种了一倍以上。
    【新华社沈阳三十日电】东北农村在今年春耕中，有计划地试用了十三种（计三千三百余台）新式机械农具，在农民中传播了良好的影响。这些新农具大部分系发给公营农场、示范农场及由各省立耕作站出租给农民试用。同时，东北人民政府农林部及各省农林厅并在全东北区选择了四十余个基础较好的互助组，贷予全套新式机械农具试用。今年春耕中，这些互助组在人民政府所派出的技术人员的指导下，普遍使用了选种机、双轮一铧犁、圆盘耙、播种机等八种机械农具，耕作效率较当地原有旧农具提高三倍至五倍，且撒种均匀、培土适宜、播种作物出苗亦整齐茁壮。如吉林省榆树县农民刘秉礼、何凤山等为首的两个互助组，使用两台播种机，以十一天半的时间，种完五百一十亩高粱和大豆，比往年用旧农具种地节省了一百四十余个人工和一百一十多个马工。黑龙江省肇源县农民王振堂的互助组，使用播种机播种，二人四马每天种四十亩地，较旧犁省七个人工，八个马工；并因播种均匀，每十亩地节省了三十余斤种籽。松江省双城县农民黄永德的互助组，使用双轮一铧犁开荒，每开荒十亩较使用旧犁约省八个人工、三十五个马工。
    各地试用新式机械农具的效果，给予广大农民以很良好的印象。互助组在试用时，附近农民均成群前来参观，对新农具的效率赞羡不已，纷纷表示来年也要使用。已经使用新农具的农民则更增强了信心。他们正在努力学习技术，以便更好地运用与掌握各种新农具。
