　　Beijing General Machinery Factory Foundry Shop
　　　　Overfulfills Contract Quota Last Month
　　　　Workers Receive 5,700 Jin of Millet as Bonus
　　[Our Newspaper's News] The Beijing General Machinery Factory Foundry Shop overfulfilled its contract quota by 28% in May. The weight of finished products also exceeded the contract stipulations and approached the standard weight. The scrap rate was 8.2%, a slight increase compared to the previous 8.09%.
　　The Beijing General Machinery Factory's production plan for the first half of this year stipulated the completion of 224 water cranes (used for adding water to locomotives). To ensure the timely completion of this batch of castings, the factory administration signed a short-term collective contract with the Foundry Shop for 30 working days in May. The contract content was drafted based on materials from Northeast factories and combined with the factory's actual conditions, with the quota based on the highest past output of finished products. The two serious problems that existed in the Foundry Shop in the past, wage egalitarianism and disunity among the foremen and assistant foremen, were resolved in April. The Foundry Shop increased its crane equipment, replaced two three-ton vertical furnaces and some light steel sandboxes. Also, after the contract was signed, the workers' production enthusiasm was high, and they actively exerted their work efficiency. Therefore, at the end of the 31-day contract period on May 31, 250 *li* of 16 water cranes, 200 *li* of 44.5 water cranes, and one air compressor were completed. The total product volume exceeded the contract quota by 28%. According to the contract, a bonus of 5,702 *jin* of millet was awarded for the excess.
　　Before the contract was signed, the factory's trade union convened several forums with veteran technical workers from the Foundry Shop to collect opinions for the engineering section to reference. After the draft contract was prepared, the union organized workers to study and discuss the draft, and collected workers' opinions to consult and revise with the administrative side. In the production process, Party and Communist Youth League members in the Foundry Shop always played a leading role, doing the hard work that others were unwilling to do, and persuading, educating, and uniting individual backward-thinking workers. The vast majority of workers had a correct understanding of the contract, realizing that it could both increase production and earn extra bonuses. In the execution of the contract, they worked from morning till night with hardly any time for leisure. The S-shaped pipe and expansion pipe cover group seized the time and actively produced. Young worker Xu Guanhai carefully studied and improved the tools, using the model's core box to increase the output of the S-shaped pipe's water ribs. As a result, the output of S-shaped pipes exceeded the quota by 30%, and the output of expansion pipe covers exceeded the quota by 100%. The workers in the main seat group had better skills, and their levels were similar. Previously, they made four large seats. Later, they added the 250 *li* water crane large base, which was very laborious, but they used about the same number of work hours as making the main seat, and still exceeded the quota by 25%. The connecting pipe and expansion pipe group exceeded the quota by 25%, but the scrap rate reached 13%, because the technical level in the group varied greatly, and the unity between the workers with high and low skills and the leaders of the group was not good.
　　In the process of production, the scrap rate of the first third of the finished products reached 13%. After correction and summarization, the scrap rate was 8.2%, a slight increase compared to the previous 8.09%. The reasons for the review are: First, the technical level of some workers is low; second, the unity between individual groups is not enough; third, they are busy exceeding the quota and therefore neglect quality. The Foundry Shop is divided into four production groups, and the first group has the least scrap. The other three groups are learning from it, actively studying to reduce scrap and improve quality. The deviations that occurred in the implementation of the contract are: First, not paying much attention to tidying up the tools, only caring about rushing to work, and throwing tools around after use. Second, the use of auxiliary materials increased. In order to make their own molds easy to use, they used more charcoal and nails. On the other hand, the content of the contract also showed some shortcomings in the implementation: For example, the work of the lathe shop to roughen the blanks should not be included in the Foundry Shop's contract; the bonus and penalty methods for scrap rate are not reasonable enough, etc. Another issue worth noting is how to maintain the high production enthusiasm of the workers during the contract period. At present, the Beijing General Machinery Factory is collecting opinions from all parties based on this experience, preparing to sign the next collective contract.

　　Organize Production Technology Mutual Aid Groups; Study Methods to Prevent Scrap
　　[Another News] The Beijing General Machinery Factory Foundry Shop organized "Production Technology Mutual Aid Groups" to carry out production mutual assistance, reduce bad work, and improve quality. In May, the Foundry Shop overfulfilled the collective contract output quota by 28%, but the scrap rate was still 8.2%, a slight increase compared to the previous 8.09%. In order to further improve quality, Bian Yongxing, foreman of the Foundry Shop, convened a meeting of production group leaders of the Foundry Shop on June 9 to study methods to prevent scrap in the future. Foreman Bian proposed to organize five "Production Technology Mutual Aid Groups" according to the production process, with no limit to the number of people in each group. Everyone helps each other, with those with high skills helping those with low skills, studying the causes of bad work, trying to reduce the number of bad work pieces, and then ensuring that no bad work pieces are produced. Worker Zhao Henglin proposed that each mutual aid group should select two inspection representatives in addition to the group leader, who are specially responsible for checking whether there are any problems with the molds, sandboxes, and joints before doing the work. If any problems are found, they should immediately tell the worker to correct them. In addition, no matter between individuals or between mutual aid groups, any problems should be pointed out at any time. Inspection meetings should be held once a week in the future to jointly study and improve shortcomings. Someone also suggested that the factory building should be cleaned regularly, and coarse and fine sand should not be mixed together to avoid easily producing bad work pieces. Based on these suggestions, the department has decided to organize "Production Technology Mutual Aid Groups" and elect inspection representatives starting this month, in order to achieve increased output and reduce scrap to improve quality.

### 北京机器总厂铸工部  上月超额完成合同定额  工人得奖金小米五千七百斤

　　北京机器总厂铸工部
    上月超额完成合同定额       
    工人得奖金小米五千七百斤
    【本报讯】北京机器厂总厂铸工部，五月份超额完成合同定额的百分之二十八，成品重量亦超过合同规定而接近了标准定重；废品率为百分之八·二，较过去百分之八·○九微增。
    北京机器总厂本年上半年生产计划中规定完成水鹤（火车头中上水用）二百二十四部。为使此批铸件按时完成，总厂行政方面于五月间与铸工部订立三十个工作日的短期集体合同。合同内容是根据东北工厂的材料及结合该厂实际情况拟订，定额以过去成品最高产量为标准。由于铸工部过去存在的工资平均主义及正、副工长不团结的两个严重问题，已于四月间解决；由于铸工部增加了起重机设备，换装了两个三吨立炉及部分轻钢砂箱；又由于合同签订后，工人生产情绪高涨，积极发挥了工作效能，所以，在五月三十一日合同期满时，完成了产品二百五十糎水鹤十六部、二百厘水鹤四十四点五部、空气压缩机一部，产品总量超过合同定额百分之二十八。超额部分按合同规定得奖小米五千七百零二斤。
    该厂工会，在合同订立前，曾数次召集铸工部老年技术工人座谈，收集意见交工务科参考。在合同草案拟就后，并组织工人研究讨论草案，汇集工人意见与行政方面磋商修改。在生产过程中，铸工部党、团员始终起着带头作用。干别人不愿干的苦活，对个别思想落后的工人进行了说服教育和团结。绝大部分工人对合同都有了正确认识，了解到既可增加生产，同时又可超额得奖。他们在执行合同中，从早到晚几无片刻休闲。Ｓ型管、伸缩管盖组，抓紧时间积极生产，青工许冠海又细心研究改进了工具，利用模型的心盒使Ｓ型管的水篾子的产量提高；结果Ｓ型管产量超额百分之三十，伸缩管盖产量超额百分之百。主座组工人技术较好，水平也差不多，以前作四个大座子，后来增加了二百五十糎水鹤大底座，很费工，但他们用的工数与做主座差不多，仍超过定额百分之二十五。接管和伸缩管组，超额虽达百分之二十五，但废活曾达百分之十三，因该组中技术水平高低悬殊，加以技术高的与技术低的工人间及正副组长团结不好所致。
    在生产进行中，起初完成的三分之一成品，废品率曾增达百分之十三，后经改正，总结时废品率为百分之八·二，较过去百分之八·○九仍然微增。检讨原因是：一、部分工人技术水平低，二、个别组间团结不够，三、忙于超出定额，因而忽视质量。铸工部计分四个生产组，以第一组废品最少，其他三组正向其看齐，积极研究减少废品提高质量。在执行合同中发生的偏向是：一、对工具不甚注意整理，只顾自己赶活，用完工具到处乱扔。二、副料的使用增加。为了使自己的模子好用，就多使炭及钉子等。另一方面，合同内容在实施中也显出了一些缺点：如旋工部打毛坯工作，不应列在铸工部合同内；废品率奖惩办法还不够合理等。另外值得注意的问题，是如何保持在执行合同期内工友们高涨的生产情绪。目前北京机器总厂正根据此次经验，搜集各方意见，准备订立下次的集体合同。
                                   （于树延、苗?）
    组织生产技术互助组  研究防止废品办法
    【又讯】北京机器厂总厂铸工部，组织“生产技术互助组”，进行生产互助，减少坏活提高质量。五月份铸工部超额完成了集体合同产量定额的百分之二十八，但废品率仍为百分之八·二，比过去八·○九微增。为进一步提高质量，铸工部边永兴工长于六月九日召集铸工部各生产组长开会，研究今后防止废品办法。边工长提议按生产程序组织五个“生产技术互助组”，各组人数不限，大家互相帮助，技术高的帮助技术低的；研究坏活原因，设法减少坏活数量，然后做到保证不出坏活。工人赵珩林提议：每一个互助组除组长外，再选两个检查代表，在做活以前专门负责检查模子、沙箱和合缝等处有无毛病；如果发现毛病，立时告诉做活的改正。另外不论个人与个人，互助组与互助组，只要发现毛病，都应随时指出。以后每周开一次检查会，共同研究改进缺点。又有人提出，厂房要经常打扫，粗细砂子不要混在一起，以免容易出坏活。根据这些建议，该部已决定自本月份起组织“生产技术互助组”，推选检查代表，以期达到增加产量，并减少废品提高质量。
