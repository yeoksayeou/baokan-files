What Help Did Soviet Municipal Experts Give Us?
    Yang Chongye
    The group of nineteen Soviet municipal construction experts, led by Abramov, came to China in September of last year at our invitation to assist us in the municipal construction projects of the capital and other major cities, and returned to the Soviet Union together in mid-May of this year. Many of them were in charge of the design and engineering of the large-scale reconstruction plan of Moscow from 1933 to 1935.

    What help did the Soviet municipal construction experts give us?

    Generally speaking, Soviet experts helped us achieve the goal of municipal construction serving production and serving the working people. Based on the advanced experience of socialist countries, they enabled our municipal construction work to avoid many detours. The following examples are specific manifestations of this.

    Renovating the sewer system is one of the urgent projects of Beijing's municipal construction. Most of Beijing's sewers are still dark ditches built during the Ming Dynasty, originally intended for draining rainwater, and have been in use for five to six hundred years. According to preliminary surveys by some of our experts, the cross-section is incorrect, the slope does not meet the requirements, and the cost of cleaning and repairing the project is very high. Therefore, it was proposed to abandon the old ditches and build new pipe ditches. Soviet expert Golyetov believed that underground ditches are a great asset and should not be easily abandoned. At the same time, he explained that the cost of building new ditches is much more expensive than the cost of cleaning and repairing the ditches. He personally went into the ditch to check and study the degree of erosion of the ditch bricks. These bricks were made of fine mud and have only been eroded by a very thin layer over the centuries. He determined that there would be no problem in using them for several more decades. Based on his recommendations after the inspection, the Municipal People's Government Sanitation Engineering Bureau thoroughly renovated the old ditches and improved the slope so that sewage could be flushed out at any time. The project of six main lines has now been completed.

    As urgent and closely related as the renovation of the sewer system is the dredging of Beijing's river and lake system. Beijing's river and lake system is very complete. The water flows from the Yuquan Mountain source in the western suburbs through the Jinhe River and the Changhe River, into the Three Seas in the city and the moat and Tongzi River surrounding the inner and outer cities, and then converges through the Tonghui River into the North Canal. These artificially dug rivers and lakes play a significant role in temperature regulation and urban environmental sanitation. However, due to years of disrepair, the waterways have gradually become silted up. If they are not dredged, mosquitoes and bacteria will breed, which will affect the health of the citizens. Soviet experts strongly agreed with the municipal authorities' plan to dredge. During the construction process, they provided great direct assistance in technical aspects. To solve the water source problem, Soviet experts designed a method to supplement the water volume with electric motor wells. Because the water output from the Yuquan Mountain source is limited, especially during the dry season in summer, most of the water flows into the paddy fields along the banks of the river, and the urban river channels cannot always maintain the minimum flow rate and water exchange effect. This is a problem that must be solved. However, many people were worried that it would not work to irrigate the river with well water. After the first five wells were drilled, the facts proved that this method was not only feasible but also used little electricity. A single well can produce 2,500 to 4,000 tons of water per day and night, and the power of each kilowatt-hour can pump 20 to 30 tons of water. According to this estimate, with fifteen wells, the river channels can maintain a certain flow, and the water in the city's lakes will become living water.

    The huge improvement in Beijing's tram transportation is also inseparable from the help of Soviet experts. Soviet expert Smirnov suggested that a maintenance system and an upkeep system should be established. At the same time, a complete production plan should be drawn up, determining the work progress and specific person in charge of each unit in the plan. As a result of the implementation of these suggestions, the work efficiency of the tram company has been greatly improved, and the repair factory completed more than 80% of the annual vehicle manufacturing plan by the end of April; moreover, the work efficiency of locomotive overhaul increased by 49.2%, and the failure rate dropped from 20% last year to 8%. Therefore, the current number of passengers has increased from 70,000 to 80,000 per day in September last year to more than 120,000, and exceeds 150,000 on weekends and holidays. The interval between trips has been reduced from 14 to 21 minutes last year to no more than 7 minutes now. At the same time, the company has turned from losing money to making a profit. For example, the profit in April reached more than 400,000 catties of millet, realizing the principle of enterprise management of public utilities. In particular, after implementing the socialist-country crew responsibility system introduced to us by Soviet experts, each vehicle has a dedicated person in charge, which not only reduces the failure rate and increases income, but also keeps the vehicles clean and orderly.

    On April 15th, Beijing unexpectedly experienced heavy rain in the spring. Tram crews rushed to return their vehicles to the factory early to protect the locomotives. Because a heavy rain in August last year damaged more than 30 locomotives. Soviet expert Smirnov was very anxious when he learned about this and paced back and forth in the tram company's consulting room. That day, he invited the workers to a meeting to discuss waterproofing methods. He said, "The citizens all say that the tram is well run and very convenient. Rainy days are exactly when people need the tram, but today everyone can't take the tram. Our business is a small matter, but affecting workers' commute to work and production is a big problem." Under his active encouragement, the workers came up with a method of installing "resistance" water baffles, so that rainwater in the tracks would not splash onto the "resistance" of the locomotive, and the "resistance" could avoid short circuits and damage due to humidity. After this method was implemented, the tram could run in the rain without being damaged again.

    Soviet experts often reminded us to cherish state property and not to have any waste or accidental losses. When they saw scattered equipment or waste products outside the factory, they would definitely suggest that the leaders collect them properly. Soviet experts suggested that we should pay attention to the repair, dismantling, cleaning, inspection, and storage of machines, and that the time for wiping, repairing, and inspection should be included in the plan, and that there should be a dedicated person in charge. If small problems are found in the machine, even small parts should be repaired and replaced in a timely manner, and should not be neglected or delayed, otherwise the entire machine will suffer greater damage. For example, the transformer of the motor of the water company had not been inspected for many years. After the Soviet experts arrived, they found that it was short of oil and immediately suggested adding oil, because a transformer short of oil would be in danger of explosion.

    In terms of work style, Soviet experts have also given us a lot of influence. To answer a question, they must first go to the work site to see, collect materials, and analyze and research before giving an answer. Their suggestions are all based on our specific circumstances, and they never use Soviet standards to demand us. For example, in drawing up municipal construction plans, Soviet experts often suggest that we should base our plans on the current financial situation and make full use of existing equipment and materials to maximize their effectiveness. Soviet experts attach great importance to figures and try to ensure their accuracy. Their scientific attitude and pragmatic style are all worthy of our learning. [Xinhua News Agency]

　　苏联市政专家给了我们些什么帮助？
    杨重野
    苏联市政建设专家阿布拉莫夫等一行十九人，于去年九月应聘来到中国，协助我们进行首都及其他大城市的市政建设工程，本年五月中旬才联袂回苏联去。其中很多是苏联一九三三——五年改建莫斯科大计划的设计和工程负责人。
    苏联市政建设专家给了我们些什么帮助呢？
    从总的方面来说，苏联专家协助我们达成了市政建设为生产服务、为劳动人民服务的目标。他们根据社会主义国家的先进经验，使我们的市政修建工作少走了很多弯路。以下的事例就是具体的表现。
    整修下水道，是北京市政建设的迫切工程之一。京市的下水道，大部分还是明朝时代修建的暗沟，当时是为了宣泄雨水用的，迄今已五、六百年。据我国有些专家初步勘察，发现断面不对，坡度也不合要求，而且清除和修理工程所需费用也很大，因此拟废弃旧沟，另建新的管沟。苏联专家高莱托夫认为：地下沟是一笔很大的财产，不能轻易废弃。同时，他说明修建新沟的费用比清除和修理道沟所需的费用要贵的多。他亲自钻入沟中察看，研究沟砖被浸蚀的程度。这些砖都是细泥烧成的，几百年来只被浸蚀了很薄的一层。他断定再使用几十年也没问题。市人民政府卫生工程局根据他考查后的建议，把旧沟彻底整修，并改善坡度，使秽水可以随时冲刷出去。现已完成六个主干的工程。
    与整修下水道同样迫切而且关系非常密切的，是疏浚北京市河湖水系。京市河湖水系是很完整的。水流从西郊玉泉山源地经过金河、长河，流入城内的三海和环绕内外城的护城河和筒子河，然后汇流经通惠河注入北运河。这些人工挖成的河湖，对气温调剂和城市环境卫生有很大的作用。但因年久失修，水道逐渐淤塞，如不疏浚，蚊虫细菌滋生，反会影响市民健康。苏联专家非常赞同市政当局进行疏浚的计划。在施工过程中，他们在技术方面直接给了很大的帮助。为了解决水源问题，苏联专家设计用电机井补充水量的办法。因为玉泉山水源出水量有限，尤其夏季枯水期，出水多半流入沿流两岸的稻田，市区河道便不能经常保持最低的流速和换水作用。这是必须解决的问题。但是用井水灌河，很多人担心行不通。在试验第一次凿成的五眼井后，事实证明这个办法不仅可行，并且用电不多。一眼井一昼夜可出水二千五百吨到四千吨，每度电的动力可抽水二十吨到三十吨。照此估计，有十五眼井，便可使河道保持一定的流量，城内湖泊的水也就成了活水。
    京市电车交通的巨大改进，也是与苏联专家的帮助分不开的。苏联专家斯米尔诺夫建议应确定检修制度和保养制度，同时要订立完善的生产计划，在计划上确定每个单位的工作进度和具体的负责人，由于这些建议实施的结果，电车公司的工作效率大为提高，修造厂在四月底就完成了全年造车计划的百分之八十强；并且，机车大修的工作效率提高了百分之四十九点二，坏车率由去年的百分之二十降为百分之八。因此现在的乘客人数，从去年九月每日的七、八万人增到十二万人以上，星期假日超过十五万人。行车时隔由去年的十四分钟到二十一分钟，减为现在的不超过七分钟。同时，公司从赔钱转到有盈余，如四月份的盈余即达小米四十余万斤，实现了公用事业企业化的方针。特别是实行苏联专家介绍给我们的社会主义国家的乘务负责制后，每车有了专人负责，不但减少坏车率，增加收入，并且使车辆保持清洁，有秩序。
    四月十五日，北京意外地在春天下了大雨。电车乘务员们为了保护机车，纷纷提前收车回厂。因为去年八月一场大雨，曾经损坏了三十多辆机车。苏联专家斯米尔诺夫知道这件事情后，急得在电车公司的顾问室里踱来踱去。当天，他就邀请工人们开会，讨论防水办法。他说：“市民都说电车搞的好了，很方便。下雨正是需要车的时候，但今天大家却坐不着电车。我们的营业是小问题，影响工友上班生产是大问题。”在他的积极鼓励下，工人们想出装置“阻力”挡水板的办法，使车轨内的雨水不致溅到机车的“阻力”上，“阻力”就可免因潮湿而串电烧毁。这个办法实行后，电车就可以在雨中开行，不致再遭受损坏。
    苏联专家时常提醒我们要爱护国家财产，不要有一点浪费或使受意外损失。他们看到工厂外面有散置的器材或废品，一定建议领导人好好地收藏起来。苏联专家建议我们应注意机器的修理、拆洗、检查和保管，要把擦修和检查的时间订在计划上，并且要有专人负责。如果发现机器出了小毛病，就是小小零件也应及时修理和更换，不能疏忽或拖延，否则会使整个机器受到更大的损失。例如自来水公司电机的变压器好多年没有检查，苏联专家去了，检查后发现缺油，便立刻建议给加油，因为变压器缺油就会发生爆炸危险的。
    在工作作风上，苏联专家也给了我们不少的影响。他们解答一个问题，一定先到工作现场去看，经过搜集材料并研究分析，然后才作答复。他们的建议，都是根据我们的具体情况提出的，从没有拿苏联的标准来要求我们。譬如在订立市政建设计划上，苏联专家常常建议我们要根据目前财政情况，尽量利用旧有的设备和材料，使其发挥到最大的效用。苏联专家很重视数目字，并尽量要求其正确。他们科学的态度和实事求是的作风，都是值得我们学习的。【新华社讯】
