Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 4th: The latest issue of the New Era magazine published an editorial entitled "Washington's Recent Tactics," pointing out that the aim of the US-British bloc in obstructing the representatives of New China from attending the United Nations is to paralyze the United Nations. The correct attitude of the Soviet Union on this issue has gained the support of progressive public opinion around the world.

The editorial first stated: The United Nations should be the most valuable tool for promoting peace and friendly relations between countries. However, the US-British bloc is attempting to use the United Nations to cover up their conspiracy to plan another world war, and has been and continues to undermine the prestige of the United Nations. The Soviet Union has consistently strived to enable the United Nations to fulfill its mission. Due to the firm attitude of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the US-British bloc has been unable to turn the United Nations into a tool of imperialist policy, and the US-British bloc is now determined to make the United Nations a waste.

The editorial then pointed out: The true intentions of Truman, Acheson, and Bevin towards the United Nations are clearly demonstrated in the issue of China's representation. No country that sincerely hopes for the United Nations to be an effective organization can tolerate a situation where the representative of one of the five major powers that constitute the backbone of the Security Council is not allowed to participate in the United Nations. If the United States continues to insist on allowing the bankrupt Kuomintang clique to represent China in the United Nations instead of the representatives of the 475 million Chinese people, then its sole purpose is to paralyze the United Nations.

The editorial concluded: Democratic public opinion believes that the Soviet Union's attitude on this issue is correct and principled, and its motive is to strengthen the United Nations. The attitude of the United States directly violates the UN Charter. Public opinion in all countries, including those under the Marshall Plan and even in the United States itself, is rightly demanding that the arbitrary actions of the US representative to the United Nations be stopped.

　　美帝阻挠我国代表出席  唯一目的在破坏联合国
    新时代指出苏联正确态度获世界进步舆论支持
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近一期的新时代杂志发表了题为《华盛顿最近的策略》的社论，指出美英集团阻挠新中国代表出席联合国的目的在于瘫痪联合国，而苏联对这一问题所持的正确态度，已获得全世界进步舆论的支持。
    社论首先说明：联合国应该是促进和平与各国间友好关系的最宝贵工具。然而，美英集团企图利用联合国来遮掩它们策划另一次世界大战的阴谋，已经并且继续在破坏联合国组织的威信。苏联则始终不渝地努力使联合国组织完成它的任务。由于苏联及人民民主国家的坚定态度，使美英集团无法把联合国变为帝国主义政策的工具，美英集团现在就决心要使联合国成为一个废物。
    社论继而指出：杜鲁门、艾奇逊及贝文之流对联合国的真正意图，在中国代表权问题上明显地表现出来。任何真诚希望联合国成为一个有效组织的国家，都不能容忍不让构成安全理事会骨干的五强之一的代表参加联合国组织的情势。如果美国继续坚持让破了产的国民党集团代表、而不是让四亿七千五百万中国人民的代表出席联合国，那么，它的唯一目的就是瘫痪联合国。
    社论最后指出：民主舆论认为苏联对这一问题所持的态度是正确的，是符合原则的，其动机在于加强联合国组织。而美国的态度则直接违反联合国宪章。一切国家的舆论，包括马歇尔化国家和美国本国的舆论在内，都正当地要求制止美国驻联合国代表的武断行动。
