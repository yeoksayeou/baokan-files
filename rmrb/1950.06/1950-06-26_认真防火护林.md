　　Conscientiously Prevent Forest Fires and Protect Forests
    Currently, many of China's forests have suffered enormous losses due to unfortunate fires. According to a survey by the Central Forestry and Land Reclamation Department, from January to mid-June of this year, the area of forests across the country that has suffered various types of damage has reached over 11.1 million mu. However, the Central Forestry and Land Reclamation Department's afforestation figure for this year is only over 1.77 million mu. This means that the area of forest destroyed in the first half of this year is already six times the area afforested for the entire year. This is a serious phenomenon that cannot be ignored!
    The growth of forests is slow. Even taking the Chinese fir, which grows relatively quickly and is used for papermaking, it still takes more than twenty years. However, once a fire breaks out, it can burn tens of thousands to hundreds of millions of mu of forest in a short period. Fire is clearly the most dangerous enemy of forests. Our forest protection work must first and foremost focus on preventing fires.
    The Northeast and Inner Mongolia are the regions where forest fires are most serious. Last year, according to incomplete statistics, there were a total of 319 minor and major forest fires in Northeast China and 70 in Inner Mongolia. According to news published in today's newspaper, fires continue to occur in these areas, which must attract our high attention and efforts to prevent forest fires and protect forests.
    Based on available materials, fires are mainly caused by carelessness in "minor matters" such as smoking and cooking during land reclamation and irregular logging, as well as by sparks entering the forest from train smokestacks. In a word, these are mostly man-made disasters, and these disasters are basically avoidable.
    The leading organs of the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions made some appeals for fire prevention and forest protection this spring, held many special meetings, and passed some fire prevention resolutions at people's representative conferences in counties and districts in forest areas. Some areas have achieved good results in fire prevention and forest protection. For example, Huadian County in Jilin Province has seriously implemented some more in-depth fire prevention and forest protection measures this year, designating special personnel to be responsible for fire prevention in the forest. When farmers burn firewood in the cultivated land around the forest area, special personnel are dispatched to watch over the embers to prevent the remaining fire from flying into the forest. This spirit of conscientious forest protection is worthy of learning everywhere. However, in other areas, work has only remained at the level of general appeals, without in-depth publicity and education for cadres and the masses; nor have they rigorously established forest protection organizations and responsibility systems; nor have they carried out forest protection work inspections. Therefore, forest protection work is still in a state of laissez-faire. Some people think that "mountain fires happen every year" and that prevention is unnecessary and impossible. This ideological paralysis has caused serious consequences.
    In order to protect forests, we must resolutely implement the instructions of the Central Forestry and Land Reclamation Department in the future: "Strictly prohibit all acts of destroying forests." We must earnestly stop all intentional and unintentional actions that destroy trees. As of now, the most important step is fire prevention. This is the most important task in forest protection work in the future, and there must be no more paralysis or neglect. To prevent fires, we must strengthen the education of the masses in forest areas on fire prevention and forest protection, inspire the masses' love for forests and the concept of cherishing national property, and rely on the masses' consciousness to create a mass movement for fire prevention and forest protection. Fire prevention and forest protection organizations must be universally established in all forest areas from the county and district level down to villages and settlements. Governments at all levels in forest areas should regularly inspect forest protection work. Forest area management should clearly stipulate a zonal responsibility system; extensively establish and expand fire-fighting equipment in forest areas, establish observation platforms, sentinel posts, fire stations, and firebreaks. Fire-prevention covers should be installed on the smokestacks of trains passing through forest areas. Strict leadership should be given to those who take logging forests as a side occupation. A reward and punishment system should be implemented in forest protection work, rewarding those who have made contributions to fire prevention and forest protection, and punishing those who are ineffective in forest protection.
    Local governments must earnestly pay attention to fire prevention and forest protection work. It should be understood that this is not only related to the supply of timber for large-scale national construction but also to the prevention of floods and droughts. Those who neglect fire prevention and forest protection work should awaken!

### 认真防火护林

　　认真防火护林
    目前我国不少的森林已因不幸的火灾而造成了巨大的损失。据中央林垦部的调查，自本年一月起至六月中旬止，全国各地区森林遭受各种破坏的面积，已达一千一百余万亩，而中央林垦部今年造林数字却只有一百七十七万余亩。这就是说，今年半年内被破坏的森林面积，已六倍于全年的造林面积。这是一个不容忽视的严重现象！
    森林的成长是迟缓的。即以成长较快的造纸用材的杉木而论，也需时二十余年。而火灾一旦爆发，短期内即可烧掉数万至数十百万亩的森林。火灾显然是森林最危险的敌人。我们的护林工作，首先必须认真防火。
    东北、内蒙是森林火灾最严重的地区。去年东北森林发生的轻重火灾，据不完全统计，共三百一十九次，内蒙是七十次。根据今天本报发表的消息，这些地区近来仍连续发生火灾，必须引起我们高度的注意，努力防火护林。
    根据现有材料，火灾的发生，主要是在开荒与非正规的采伐等工作中，对吸烟与烧饭等“小事”，不加谨慎，以及火车烟突吐火入林等所引起的。一句话，这多半是人为的灾害，这些灾害基本上是可以避免的。
    东北和内蒙两区的领导机关，在今春曾作过一些防火护林的号召，开过许多专门的会议，在林区的县区人民代表会上也通过了一些防火的决议。有些地区在防火护林中有好的成绩。如吉林省桦甸县，今年认真地作了一些较为深入的防火护林的措施，指定了专人在林中负责防火。当农民在林区周围的耕地内燃烧柴草时，林区特派专人看守余烬，使余火不致飞入林中。这种认真护林的精神，值得各地学习。但另外也有一些地区只是把工作停留在一般的号召上，没有对干部群众进行深入的宣传教育；更没有严密地建立起护林组织和责任制度；也未进行护林工作检查。因此，护林工作仍处于自流的状况。有些人以为“山火年年有”，用不着、也不可能防止。这种思想上的麻痹，就造成了严重的后果。
    为了保护森林，今后必须坚决执行中央林垦部的指示：“严格禁止一切破坏森林的行为”。必须把一切有意无意的毁坏林木的行动，认真停止下来。就目前来说，其中最主要的一着，就是防火。这是今后护林工作中头等重要的任务，不容再有麻痹和忽视。要防火就必须加强对林区群众防火护林的教育，启发群众的爱林思想和爱护祖国财产的观念，依靠群众的自觉，造成群众性的防火护林运动。各地林区自县区以下直到村屯，必须普遍建立防火护林的组织。林区各级政府应经常进行检查护林工作。林区管理应明确规定分区负责制；广泛建立和扩充林区的消防设备，设立了望台，监视哨，防火站，防火线。在经过林区的火车烟突上，应装置防火罩。对以采伐森林为副业的，应严格地加以领导。并应在护林工作中实行奖惩制度，对防火护林有功者奖，对护林不力者罚。
    各地方政府必须认真重视防火护林工作。须知这不仅是有关于国家大规模建设的木材供应问题，而且是有关于水旱灾的预防问题。忽视防火护林的工作的人们，应当觉醒！
