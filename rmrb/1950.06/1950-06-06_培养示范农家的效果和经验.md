　　The Effects and Experiences of Cultivating Demonstration Farmers
　　Hulan Agricultural Experiment Station Wang Hongduo
　　In order to promote superior seeds, improve agricultural techniques, and increase agricultural production, the Hulan Agricultural Experiment Station selected a model mutual aid group as a demonstration group in Gongcun Village, Shuangjing District, Hulan County in 1949. The group consisted of two farming households with 6.9 *qing* of land, three horses, and three laborers.

　　I. Preliminary Persuasion and Education

　　When selecting the demonstration group, the general public believed that becoming a demonstration farmer meant losing all freedom and having to listen to the experiment station in everything. They did not think that the experiment station could help them improve agricultural techniques and increase yields. This mindset naturally presented an obstacle in the initial stages of the work. To complete the task, we used the demonstration farmers as typical examples and conducted ideological education, enlightening the masses with technical knowledge. After this persuasion, the public's awareness generally improved. By the autumn harvest, seeing the actual situation where the demonstration farmers harvested more grain and increased their sideline income, the villagers further overcame their ideological concerns and eagerly strived to become demonstration farmers. This was a process of ideological transformation of the peasant masses under the enlightenment of practical technical education.

　　II. Technical Assistance and Guidance

　　To ensure that the demonstration farmers could play a guiding and promotional role, we provided the following technical guidance:

　　1. Loans of improved seeds: To increase production and lay the foundation for promotional work, we loaned 200 *jin* of high-quality Manchurian Golden soybeans and 220 *jin* of Kehua wheat. At the same time, we provided technical guidance in seed selection, sowing, weeding, and harvesting.

　　2. Seed disinfection: Local farmers often neglected seed disinfection, which frequently led to diseases. We guided them in disinfecting wheat using the cold water-warm water soaking method (i.e., soaking in cold water for 10 hours, then in warm water at 45 degrees Celsius for 2 minutes, then at 55 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes, followed by adding cold water and drying in the shade).

　　In addition, in sideline production, we loaned 200 high-quality Leghorn chicks and provided detailed guidance in feeding and management. In terms of pig breeding, we used boars raised at the station to mate with the demonstration farmers' sows to promote the selection and understanding of breeding pigs among the masses. We also provided them with a lot of help in preventing and controlling livestock diseases.

　　III. Results Achieved

　　1. Increased grain production and reduced disasters: This gave the local masses great encouragement and enlightenment in improving technology. Last year, the demonstration group planted 1 *qing* (15 *mu*) of wheat and harvested 1,600 *jin*, with good growth and plump grains. Because the seeds were disinfected during sowing, no diseases occurred during the growth period, and there were no plants with smut disease. Compared with the wheat of the local masses, they harvested twice as much. They planted Manchurian Golden soybeans on 1.7 *qing* and harvested a total of 4,600 *jin*, more than 50% higher than the local masses.

　　2. Increased sideline income. Two hundred chicks were loaned to the demonstration group. Six months later, when laying began, only 67 hens and 4 roosters remained (the remaining 35% of the roosters were eliminated, and 20% died). Laying began in December 1949, and by the end of February of this year, more than 1,300 eggs had been produced. According to the statistics for two and a half months, the income was 7.2 million yuan (Northeast currency, the same below). Recently, the egg production has gradually increased from 36 to 46 per day, with a daily income of 170,000 to 180,000 yuan. Two sows were raised, and after mating with boars from the farm, they had two litters of piglets, a total of 18, which are estimated to sell for about 7 million yuan. At the end of February of this year, the farm gave the demonstration group another round of livestock vaccinations, dispelling concerns about contagious diseases.

　　3. Increased productivity. Due to the increase in agricultural and sideline income, a solid foundation has been laid for expanded reproduction. Not only did they use the sideline income to purchase 6 *shi* of corn, but they also bought 15 carts of manure and enough horse feed. In addition, they also made a batch of farm tools and clothes. This has shown an improvement in both life and productivity.

　　IV. 1950 Plan

　　1. Given the effectiveness of the demonstration group, it is planned to expand from a small group to a large group this year and extend it to the entire village next year.

　　2. Adopt new-style farm tools: On the fields, due to the voluntary adjustment of the demonstration farmers, the land area is concentrated (a total of 4.2 *qing* of wheat is planted, occupying three plots, each more than 1 *qing*), which is convenient for cultivation and has sufficient conditions for the use of new-style farm tools. Therefore, this year it is planned to use new-style wheat harvesters, threshers, Songnong No. 1 weeding machines, and Lianhehao shovel weeding machines to improve work efficiency.

　　3. Seed selection and disinfection: Kehua wheat will still be planted, disinfected with cold water and warm water, Manchurian Golden soybeans will still be planted after grain selection, and millet will be planted with carefully selected Bo Di Zu millet.

　　4. Engage in more sideline production: Strengthen pig and chicken breeding, with the farm lending 500 chicks and breeding sows mated with boars from the farm.

　　5. Chicken manure utilization: Chicken manure has a high fertilizer effect, but most farmers do not use chicken manure as fertilizer. It is planned to accumulate it in ground pits and allow it to fully decompose before using it as fertilizer.

　　V. Summary

　　1. Demonstration farmers are the bridge for technology promotion, so in the work, it is necessary to strengthen the demonstration farmers' understanding of technical knowledge and gradually enable them to master scientific technology to play a guiding role.

　　2. Farmers other than the demonstration households should also be educated to understand the importance of agricultural technology, such as the selection of superior varieties, the application of fertilizers, and the prevention and control of pests and diseases. Use the actual examples of demonstration households to patiently persuade the masses to strive for progress in technology.

　　3. The demonstration group should be closely integrated with the masses and work together to enable agricultural technology to play a universal role in the masses through the strength of the demonstration group.

　　4. In the work, it is necessary to maintain regular contact, understand the situation, explore problems, and solve problems.

　　培养示范农家的效果和经验
    呼兰农事试验场  王鸿铎
    呼兰农事试验场为了推广优良种子，改进农业技术，增加农业生产，于一九四九年在呼兰县双井区工农村选择了一个模范互助小组作为示范小组。该组是两家农户，有土地六垧九亩，马三匹，劳动力三个。
    一、初步工作的说服教育
    选择示范小组时，一般群众都认为当上示范农家，便一切都不能自由，凡事得听试验场的摆弄，并不认为试验场在改良农业技术提高产量上对他们有帮助。群众的这种思想情况，在初步工作上，自然是一个阻碍。为了完成工作任务，我们一面以示范农家作典型示范，一面进行思想教育，以技术知识开导群众。经过这一说服工作，群众觉悟便普遍提高，到秋收时，看出示范农家的粮食打的多，副业收入增加的实际情况，全村群众更进一步的克服了思想上的顾虑，而争先恐后的争取当示范农家。这是农民群众在实际技术教育启示下的一个思想转变过程。
    二、技术上的协助指导
    我们为了培养示范农家能发挥启导与推广作用，在技术指导上作了如下的工作：
    １、贷发良种：为了增产并打下推广工作的基础，贷给了品质优良的满仓金大豆二百斤，克华小麦二百二十斤，同时在选种、播种、铲趟（中耕锄草）、收割等工作上，予以技术指导。
    ２、种子消毒：对于种子消毒，当地农民都很忽视，所以经常发生病害。我们在种子消毒上指导小麦用冷水温汤浸种法（即冷水浸十小时，温水四十五度浸二分钟，五十五度浸五分钟，再加冷水，然后阴干）。
    此外在副业上我们贷给品种优良的莱克亨鸡雏二百只，并在饲养管理上作了详尽的指导，同时在种猪交配方面，以本场所养种用公猪与示范农家的母猪交配，以促进群众对于种猪的选择与认识，并在家畜疾病防治上也给他们很多的帮助。
    三、收到的效果
    １、粮食增加，灾害减少，这给了当地群众在改良技术上一个很大的鼓励和启示。该示范组去年共种小麦一垧（十五市亩），打了一千六百斤，生长良好，麦粒肥大。因为种子在播种时经过消毒，在生长期间未发生任何病害，没有一棵黑穗病。与当地群众的小麦相比，多打了一倍。种满仓金大豆，一垧七亩，共打了四千六百斤，比当地群众多打了二分之一强。
    ２、副业收入增加。贷给该示范组鸡雏二百只，六个月后，产卵开始时，只剩下母鸡六十七只，公鸡四只（其余淘汰公鸡百分之三十五，死亡百分之二十）。一九四九年十二月开始产卵，到本年二月末已产卵一千三百多，据两个半月的统计，收入七百二十万元（东北币，下同），最近产卵量逐渐增加，由每日三十六个增加到四十六个，每天能收入十七、八万元。饲养母猪两头，由农场种猪交配后，已下了两窝小猪，共十八个，估计能卖七百万元左右。本年二月末，农场又给该示范组打了一次家畜预防注射，解消了怕传染疫病的顾虑。
    ３、生产力提高。由于农副业收入的增加，故充分打下了扩大再生产的基础，不但利用副业收入购买了六石玉米，同时还买了十五车粪与足够的马料；此外又添制了一批农具与衣服等项。这在生活上与生产力上，都已显示了提高一步。
    四、一九五零年的计划
    １、鉴于示范小组有成效，故今年拟由小组扩展到大组，并于明年推广到全村。
    ２、改用新式农具：在田块上由于示范农家自愿调整，土地面积集中（共种小麦四垧二亩，占地三块，每块一垧多）耕作便利，有使用新式农具足够的条件，所以今年在农具使用上拟用新式的割麦机、脱粒机、松农一号锄草机、联合号铲趟机以提高工作效能。
    ３、选种消毒：小麦仍种克华小麦，用冷水温汤消毒，大豆仍种经过粒选的满仓金，谷子种经过精选的薄地租。
    ４、多搞副业生产：加强猪鸡饲养，由本场贷鸡雏五百只，母猪配种，由农场种猪交配。
    ５、鸡粪利用：鸡粪肥效很高，但利用鸡粪做肥料，一般农民不采用，拟堆集地坑，使充分腐烂后，充当肥料。
    五、总结
    １、示范农家为技术推广的桥梁，所以在工作上要加强示范农家技术知识的认识与了解，并逐步的使其能掌握科学技术，以发挥其启导作用。
    ２、对示范户以外的农民也要进行教育，使之了解农业技术的重要性，如优良品种的选择，肥料的施用，病虫害的防治等问题，以示范户的实际例子耐心的向群众说服，以争取他们在技术上求得进步。
    ３、示范组要与群众切实结合，打成一片，使农业技术借示范组的力量，能在群众中起普遍推广的作用。
    ４、在工作上要经常联系，了解情况，探讨问题，解决问题。
