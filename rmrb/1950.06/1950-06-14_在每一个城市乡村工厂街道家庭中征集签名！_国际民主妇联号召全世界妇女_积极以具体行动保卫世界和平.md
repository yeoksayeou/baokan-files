Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The Ninth Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation, held in Helsinki, Finland in April, passed a resolution on "Member Organizations of the International Democratic Women's Federation Should Expand Activities to Defend World Peace." The resolution, in response to the current situation where world peace is severely threatened, pointed out the urgency of defending world peace and the responsibility of every good person to defend world peace. This responsibility is that they should use more effective actions to defend world peace and broadly expand the ranks of the peace movement. To this end, in-depth publicity must be carried out. The resolution calls on women of all countries to actively defend world peace with concrete actions.

Appeal to the Women of the World

In order to support the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and fully support this movement, the Ninth Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation also passed an "Appeal to the Women of the World," pointing out that the crisis of war is seriously threatening our children, families, and happiness, and calling on all peace-loving and democratic women to sign the peace appeal. The "Appeal to the Women of the World" writes:

"Women of the world! The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation calls on you to sign the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and to collect signatures in every city, village, factory, street, and family. You must participate with the greatest enthusiasm in the work of establishing peace committees in various places.

Mothers, wives, female workers and peasants, scientists and students, women of all professions, women of all nationalities! As long as you value the work of world peace, as long as you cherish family happiness and the future of your children, you should angrily protest against the instigators of bloody wars of aggression. You should join with democratic groups, trade unions, youth leagues, and other groups in all countries to participate in the great people's movement for peace and hold high the banner of defending world peace.

Women of the world! Fulfill your mission! Sign the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. Demand that the atomic bomb—a weapon of aggression and mass destruction of humanity—be declared illegal. Declare any country or government that first uses atomic weapons to be a war criminal. Let us unite to defend world peace! Defend life!"

The "Appeal to the Women of the World" was signed by the following Executive Committee members of the International Democratic Women's Federation: Nina Popova of the Soviet Union, Goyan Goujuli of France, Yujeni Plajiova of Poland, Anna Shirichtova of Czechoslovakia, Constancia Craciun of Romania, Bai Yun of China, as well as executive committee members or representatives of the International Democratic Women's Federation from twenty-one countries including Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, Greece, India, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Finland, and Spain.

    国际民主妇联号召全世界妇女  积极以具体行动保卫世界和平
    【新华社十二日讯】四月间在芬兰赫尔辛基举行的国际民主妇联第九次执行委员会曾通过“国际民主妇联各会员团体应扩大保卫世界和平的活动”的决议。决议针对目前世界和平遭到严重威胁的局势，指出了保卫世界和平的迫切性和每个善良人民保卫世界和平的职责，这个职责就是他们应当用更多更有效的行动来保卫世界和平，广泛地扩大和平运动的队伍。为此就必须作深入的宣传。决议号召各国妇女应积极地以具体行动来保卫世界和平。
    告世界妇女书
    为了拥护世界和平大会常设委员会的呼吁书，并全力支持这一运动，国际民主妇联第九次执委会上又曾通过“告世界妇女书”，指出：战争的危机已严重地威胁着我们的孩子、家庭和幸福，号召一切爱好和平民主的妇女在和平呼吁书上签名。“告世界妇女书”写道：
    “全世界妇女们：国际民主妇联执委会号召你们在世界和平大会常设委员会的呼吁书上签名，并在每一城市、乡村、工厂、街道和家庭里征集签名。你们必须以最大的积极性参加在各地成立保卫和平委员会的工作。
    母亲们，妻子们，女工们和农妇们，科学家和学生们，各种职业的妇女们，各民族的妇女们！只要你们重视世界和平工作，只要你们珍视家庭幸福和孩子的未来，你们应该愤怒地高声抗议，反对血腥的侵略战争的煽动者。你们应该和各国的民主团体、工会、青年团及其他团体一起，参加伟大的人民和平斗争运动，高举保卫世界和平的旗帜。
    全世界的妇女们！完成你们的任务！在拥护世界和平大会常设委员会的呼吁书上签名。要求宣布原子弹——侵略的、大规模毁灭人类的武器为非法。宣告任何第一个使用原子武器的国家与政府为战争罪犯。让我们团结起来保卫世界和平！保卫生命！”
