Xinxiang Special District Prevents and Controls Infectious Diseases
　　Conducts Health Education Through County People's Congresses, etc.
　　Organizes Primary School Teachers and Women Cadres to Assist in Vaccination
[This newspaper's report] This spring, infectious diseases occurred commonly in various counties of the Xinxiang Special District, Pingyuan Province. According to statistics from late April, 6,824 people in 87 villages in 12 counties suffered from various acute infectious diseases. Measles was the most common, accounting for 5,183 people, followed by smallpox, scarlet fever, influenza, and typhoid fever. To this end, the Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and various counties vigorously carried out health propaganda, infectious disease prevention and control, and vaccination work. In the propaganda work, the Special Commissioner's Office Health Section grasped the disease information in various places and sent people to Wuzhi, Yuanyang, Jiaozuo and other areas with outbreaks to conduct in-depth understanding, collect prevention and treatment experiences and methods, and issued five notices before and after, introducing experience to various places, and conducting criticism and commendation. In addition to conveying the special commissioner's office notices, the counties also put forward the epidemic prevention work at the people's congresses at all levels, using the method of accounting to explain the serious losses caused by infectious diseases to the masses, in order to open up the minds of the representatives and request joint promotion of health work. Villages in various places widely used broadcasting tubes and blackboards for health propaganda. In areas where diseases were severely prevalent, primary and secondary school students were organized to assist in carrying out propaganda. Qinyang and other ten counties also carried out key health work inspections, strengthened the connection of disease information, and rectified mass health organizations.
　　In terms of infectious disease prevention and control, the Special Commissioner's Office divided the original medical team into two teams, and transferred a part of the cadres from the Special Commissioner's Office Hospital to form an epidemic prevention team, which went to Wuzhi, Yanjin, and the Jiaozuo mining area to carry out prevention and control work. Ji'yuan and other eleven counties all transferred and mobilized local Chinese and Western doctors to form temporary prevention and propaganda teams, which went deep into the districts and villages to carry out propaganda and prevention work. In the treatment, both Chinese and Western medical methods were adopted, and attention was paid to telling the masses about prevention, isolation, and nursing knowledge. Free and partially free treatment was given to poor workers, peasants, and other working people, as well as poor revolutionary soldiers and cadres; for some people who are currently unable to pay for medical expenses, the method of bookkeeping (repayment after wheat harvest) was adopted to ensure that every patient can receive timely treatment. In terms of vaccination work, by the end of March, the first phase of vaccination work had been completed, with a total of 234,082 people vaccinated. In the process of vaccination, 1,150 primary school teachers and women cadres from various places were taught, enabling them to initially master vaccination techniques, laying a solid foundation for the second phase of vaccination.

　　新乡专区防治传染病
    通过各县人代会等展开卫生宣传
    组织小学教员妇女干部协助种痘
    【本报讯】平原省新乡专区各县，今春曾普遍发生传染病，据四月下旬统计，十二个县的八十七个村中，患各种急性传染病者达六千八百二十四人。其中以麻疹为最多，占五千一百八十三人，其次还有天花、猩红热、流行性感冒、伤寒等。为此，新乡专署与各县曾大力开展卫生宣传、传染病防治与种痘工作。在宣传工作中，专署卫生科掌握各地疾病情报，并派人赴武陟、原阳、焦作等发病地区作深入的了解，收集防治经验与办法，前后发出五次通报，给各地介绍经验，并进行批评与表扬。各县除传达专署通报外，并在各界人民代表会议上提出了防疫工作，用算账的办法，说明传染病给群众损失的严重，以打通代表们的思想，要求共同推动卫生工作。各地村庄普遍运用广播筒、黑板报等进行了卫生宣传。在疾病流行严重地区，又组织了高、初小学生和中学生协助展开宣传。沁阳等十县并有重点地进行了卫生工作检查，加强了疾病情报的联系，整顿了群众卫生组织。
    在传染病防治方面，专署将原有医疗队分为两队，并抽调专署医院等一部分干部另组成一个防疫队，分赴武陟、延津和焦作矿区等地进行防治工作。济源等十一县，均抽调与动员当地中西医生，组成临时的防治宣传队，深入到区村进行宣传防治工作。治疗中兼采中、西医疗方法，并注意告诉群众预防与隔离、护理等常识。对贫苦工人、农民和其他劳动人民以及贫苦烈军干属等，则施行免费与部分免费的治疗；对一部分目前无力偿付医药费用的群众，则采用记账（麦收后偿还）的办法，务使每一个病人都能够得到及时的治疗。在种痘工作方面，到三月底止，已完成了第一期种痘工作，共接种二十三万四千零八十二人。在种痘过程中，并教会了各地的小学教员和妇女干部一千一百五十人，使他们初步掌握了种痘技术，为第二期种痘打下了有力的基础。
