[Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal People's Government's project to solve waterlogging in the Paozi River area in the city's first district has now completed the excavation and wall culvert work, and the installation of cement pipes began yesterday. Paozi River is located in the southeast corner of the inner city and is a place where working people gather. The terrain is low-lying, and every rainy season, the rainwater from the surrounding 37.8 hectares eventually flows here, causing serious waterlogging. The waterlogged area is about 50,000 square meters, and the water depth reaches one meter. Residents cannot go out, and houses are often submerged in water for one or two months. In order to strive for completion before the rainy season, the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau began construction in the area on the 6th of this month. A new 1.25-meter diameter cement pipe sewer, 147 meters long, will be built from the east entrance of Kuijia Factory, through the city wall, to the east moat outside the city, and the existing Paozi River will be dredged to divert rainwater into the moat outside the city. The entire project is expected to be completed on the 5th of next month.

　　排除泡子河积水工程
    下月五日全部竣工
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府为解决本市一区泡子河积水所施工程，现已完成刨槽及掏挖城墙涵洞工作，昨起开始按装洋灰管。泡子河在内城的东南角，是劳动人民聚居的地方，地势低洼，每当雨季，附近三十七点八公顷面积的雨水最后都流到这里，造成严重的积水，积水面积约五万平方公尺，水深达一公尺，居民无法外出，房子常浸在水里一两个月之久。为了争取在雨季前完工，京市卫生工程局自本月六日起即开始在该地施工。自盔甲厂东口起穿城墙到城外东护城河新建直径一·二五米洋灰管下水道一百四十七公尺，并将旧有的泡子河加以疏浚，将雨水导入城外护城河。整个工程，下月五日即可竣工。
