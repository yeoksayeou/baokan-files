Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: Speech by gentleman Ye Gongchuo at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 22nd. The full text is as follows:

　　I was invited by the government to come to Beijing to attend this meeting. On the way, I kept thinking about what position I should take, which took a lot of pondering. Because I haven't participated in actual politics for many years, and I've been ill for nearly a decade, although I can be said to be relatively close to the people, my contribution to the public is only this much. Although I worked with Mr. Sun Yat-sen, I was never a member of the Kuomintang. Although I can't say that my thinking is advanced, I'm not willing to say that I'm outdated. If you ask me what I've done in recent years, I have nothing to show. Later, when I entered the venue and saw Chairman Mao's photo and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's photo side by side on the rostrum, I thought I should still be considered a follower of Mr. Sun Yat-sen! When I learned that the result of this meeting was the implementation of the Land Reform Law, my understanding became even clearer: Chairman Mao and Mr. Sun Yat-sen are consistent. However, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of equal land rights and land to the tillers were never realized. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that the revolution has not yet succeeded, and this matter must be included. Today, Chairman Mao has accomplished it, which is really comforting to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven. What Mr. Sun said had not been accomplished can now be accomplished by Chairman Mao. Therefore, if this matter is handled well, it will not only be a success for the People's Government, a success for the Communist Party, and a success for Chairman Mao, but it will also be a success for Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Therefore, I think that people across the country who have had relationships with Mr. Sun and the Kuomintang, especially the followers of Mr. Sun, should especially support this matter, and there is no doubt about its implementation. I have not been a member of the Kuomintang or the Communist Party in any period, so everyone probably won't say that I have any bias, but I want to advise everyone to use the same mentality of following Mr. Sun to follow Chairman Mao, and not just in the matter of land reform. This is historical and rational, not emotional or utilitarian, because the New Democracy actually contains many of Mr. Sun's teachings, but Chairman Mao has developed Mr. Sun's teachings more deeply and concretely. Therefore, I especially call on those who are related to Mr. Sun and the Kuomintang to pay attention. Furthermore, what I am saying is not that Chairman Mao's decrees must conform to Mr. Sun's teachings in order to be obeyed, but that those that conform to Mr. Sun's teachings should be obeyed even more. Moreover, most of the current decrees only differ from Mr. Sun's teachings in terms of degree and sequence, and there is no clear division that cannot be merged, which does not need to be discussed in detail. However, this matter, which has not been done in two thousand years, must not fail today. Therefore, Article 39 of the draft, which refers to the implementation methods, is a crucial key, and I hope the government will consider it very carefully. In addition, the legal definitions of landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, poor peasants, hired farmhands, and other rural social class components must be accurately defined and promulgated as soon as possible, so that the people of the whole country, especially in rural areas, can be prepared in advance. This point is quite important. I hope that not only will this land reform be successful, but that all the matters proposed at the conference will achieve satisfactory results.

    特邀列席绅耆
    叶恭绰的发言
    【新华社二十四日讯】绅耆叶恭绰二十二日在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上的发言。全文如下：  此次承政府邀请来京参加本会议，一路上自想我究竟站在什么立场上，狠费踌躇。因为不参与实际政治已有多年，卧病也将十载，虽比较可说接近民众，但对大众的贡献不过如此，虽跟着孙中山先生做过事，但始终不是国民党。我思想虽不能说前进，但要说我落伍我却不甘心，要说我近年有什么表现，我又没有，后来入场看见主席台上毛主席的相片同孙中山先生的像片并列，我想我还是算为孙中山先生的信徒吧！等到知道这次会议的结晶系在土改法案的施行，我的观念更加明白毛主席和中山先生是前后一贯的，不过中山先生所主张的平均地权，耕者有其田都没有办到，中山先生说革命尚未成功这一件就必包在内，今天得毛主席来办到，实在是可以告慰中山先生在天之灵的。孙先生说的未成功，现在可由毛主席替他成功了，所以这件事如果办好，不但是人民政府成功，共产党成功，毛主席成功，也就等于孙中山先生成功一样。所以我想全国中首与孙先生和国民党生过关系的人，尤其孙先生的信徒都更应特别拥护这件事，进行是毫无疑义的。我未入过任何时期的国民党也不是共产党，大约大家心里不至说我有什么偏向，但我要劝大家要把前此信从孙先生的心理，来信从毛主席，并且不止土改这一件事，这是历史的理智的，不是情感的功利的，因为新民主主义中实已包涵很多的孙先生遗教在内，不过孙先生的遗教毛主席发挥得更深博更具体化而已。因此我特别唤起与孙先生及国民党有关人士的注意，再者，我这一说并非说毛主席的政令要合孙先生的遗教才要服从，不过合乎孙先生遗教的更应服从而己，况现行各政令与孙先生遗教大多数只有程度深浅，程序先后之分，并无泾渭不能合流之处，不待详论。不过这件二千年未办过的事，今天来办当然不许失败。所以草案第三十九条，所指的实施办法，是一个大关键，望政府十分慎重考虑。又地主、富农、中农、贫农、雇农及其他农村社会阶级成份的合法定义，必须确当规定及早预颁，使全国人民，尤其农村都可先有准备。这一点相当重要，希望不只这一次土改成功，一切大会所提议的事，都得到美满的结果。
