Through Labor-Management Consultation Overcomes Business Difficulties

　　Private Yufeng and Dyeing Factory See Improved Business

　　[Beijing News Agency] The private Yufeng and Machine Dyeing Factory, through consultations between labor and management based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit to overcome difficulties, has now seen improved business, improved product quality, and cleared outstanding debts. In the three months from February to April, the factory's business was poor due to poor sales and backward technology. It only operated for a little over ten days, dyeing 4,369 bolts of cloth, which was not enough to cover expenses. Workers' wages were two months in arrears, and the capitalist owed over 40 million yuan. In order to overcome the difficulties in operation, labor and management agreed in mid-April to implement the following measures: half of the employees (nineteen people) would temporarily return home, and those returning home would be paid 30% of their original wages, while those remaining in the factory would be paid 70% of their original wages. If the business situation improved, the capitalist would immediately notify the workers returning home to return to the factory. If the business was not good for three consecutive months, the workers returning home and those staying in the factory would rotate. At the same time, the workers also discussed how to improve technology, such as reducing dyeing flaws (i.e., uneven color) and red edges, etc. The capitalist also accepted the workers' opinions and hired a new technician with better skills. After such improvements, operations have continued for more than half a month in the past month, and business has improved greatly compared to before. Previously, due to technical limitations, they dared not accept orders for certain colors like Haichang blue, grass green, light-colored cloth, etc., but now they dare to accept them. There has also been progress in quality. For example, in April, the trade company returned sixty of the two hundred bolts of gray cloth dyed, and also returned twenty of the two hundred bolts of Shilin gray cloth dyed. But in May, none of the two hundred bolts of Shilin gray cloth dyed were returned. Due to the result of some workers returning home and reducing wages, monthly expenses can be reduced by about 6,000 jin of millet. Now the factory's business has reached a maintainable state and has repaid more than 40 million yuan in debt.

　　通过劳资协商克服了经营难关
    私营裕丰和染厂业务好转
    【京市新闻处讯】私营裕丰和机器染厂，由于劳资双方以平等两利的原则协商克服困难，现在业务已见好转，产品质量提高，积欠债务已还清。该厂在二月至四月三个月中，因销路不好，技术落后，营业情况一直很差，总共才开工十余天，染了四三六九匹布，不够开支，职工工资两月未能付给，资方还负债四千余万元。为了克服经营上的困难，劳资双方曾于四月中旬协议，实行了下面的办法：职工暂时回家一半（十九人），回家职工工资按原工资的三成发给，留厂的则按原工资七成发给，如营业情况好转，则资方立即通知回家工人返厂，如接连三月营业不好，则回家与留厂的工人互相调换。同时工人们还讨论了如何提高技术，像减少染花（即颜色不匀）及红边等，资方也接受了工人的意见，聘请了一个新的技术较好的技师。经过这样的改善，一个月以来，已连续开工半个多月，业务比以前已大有改进。以前因限于技术，不敢应的活，如海昌蓝、草绿、浅色布等，现在也敢应了；在质量方面也有进步，例如四月份给贸易公司染的二百匹灰布就退回了六十匹，染二百匹士林灰布也退回了二十匹，而五月份染的士林灰布二百匹，一匹也没退回。由于部分工人回家，和降低工资的结果，每月可减少开支约六千斤小米。现在该厂业务已达到能够维持的状态，并已偿还了四千余万元的债务。
