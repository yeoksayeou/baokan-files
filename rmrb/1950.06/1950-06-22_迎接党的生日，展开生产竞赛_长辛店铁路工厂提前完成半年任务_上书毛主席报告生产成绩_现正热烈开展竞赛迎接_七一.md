　　Welcoming the Party's Birthday, Launching a Production Competition
    Changxindian Railway Factory Completes Half-Year Task Ahead of Schedule
    Writes to Chairman Mao Reporting Production Achievements
    Now Vigorously Launching Competition to Welcome "July 1st"
    [Our Newspaper] The Changxindian Railway Factory exceeded its production targets for March, April, and May. As of June 10th, it had repaired vehicles equivalent to 71.9 large-scale locomotives, 347.9 passenger cars, and 1,148.9 freight cars, completing and exceeding the half-year production task assigned to the factory by the Ministry of Railways. In terms of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars alone, this saved the state over 15.76 million jin of millet. To welcome "July 1st," all employees of the factory decided to continue exceeding the June production plan and create even higher new records. On June 10th, all employees of the factory wrote letters to Chairman Mao and Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, reporting this good news. In his reply on June 13th, Chairman Peng Zhen pointed out: "Due to your active efforts in production and the improvement of production organization and technology, your factory's production has achieved great success." In addition to congratulating all employees on the success of their work, Chairman Peng Zhen also encouraged them to "continue to carry out production competitions, improve production efficiency, and create new and higher records."
    The original letter from all employees of the Changxindian Railway Factory to Chairman Mao is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    Please accept this good news from all of us employees: Our factory has been exceeding the targets set by the Ministry every month since March. In April, we repaired the highest number of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars in the factory's history. As of June 10th, we have repaired vehicles equivalent to 71.9 large-scale locomotives, 347.9 passenger cars, and 1,148.9 freight cars, completing and exceeding the half-year task assigned by the Ministry. The savings for the state, calculated for locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars alone, amount to 15,760,921 jin of millet. Although the task assigned by the Ministry for June has been greatly increased, in order to welcome the great "July 1st" holiday, everyone has decided to continue exceeding this month's plan and create an unprecedented new record for our factory. To this end, Party members have proposed, and with the support of the vast majority of workers, to repair one more locomotive, one passenger car, and five freight cars in addition to the regular work schedule, as a gift for "July 1st." In the course of production, some departments have recently changed their labor organization, signed liaison contracts, eliminated work gaps, and improved work methods, thereby improving production efficiency. Each workshop and shift has put forward guarantees to complete the task on time. Everyone said: "Our factory exceeded the tasks for April and May by a large margin. There are still some problems in our work. In June, we must eliminate these problems and work hard, and also strive for the national model factory red flag in the second phase." We are all very happy. Of course, we will never stop our efforts. We will continue to overcome the difficulties and shortcomings in our work, improve quantity and quality, and better complete and exceed the second phase of the task. We wish you good health!
            Respectfully, all the workers of the Changxindian Railway Factory
                  June 10th

    【本报讯】长辛店铁路工厂三、四、五月份连续超过生产任务，截至六月十日止，检修车辆共折合大修机车七一·九台，客车三四七·九辆，货车一、一四八·九辆，完成并超过了铁道部分配给该厂的半年生产任务。仅机、客、货车三项，即替国家节省小米一千五百七十六万余斤。为了迎接“七一”，该厂全体职工决定要继续超过六月份生产计划，创造更高的新纪录。六月十日该厂全体职工特分别写信给毛主席和北京市总工会彭真主席，报告这个喜信。彭真主席于六月十三日复信指出：“由于你们积极努力生产，改进生产组织与技术，你们工厂的生产已经收到了很大的成绩。”彭真主席除庆祝全体职工工作的成功外，并勖勉他们“继续开展生产竞赛，提高生产效率，创造新的更高的纪录。”
    长辛店铁路工厂全体职工给毛主席的原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    请接受我们全体职工向你报这个喜信：我厂从三月份起，每月都是超过部给任务。我们四月份检修机、客、货三种车辆，都超过了本厂历史上最高的数字。截止到六月十号，我们检修车辆已经达到折合大修机车七一·九台，客车三四七·九辆，货车一、一四八·九辆，都完成并超过了部给的半年任务。替国家节省小米仅机、客、货车三项算起来有一千五百七十六万零九百二十一市斤。六月份的部给任务虽然大大增加，但我们为了迎接伟大的“七一”这个节日，大伙决定仍然要超过这月计划，创出我们厂空前未有的新纪录来。为此党员提出并得到绝大多数工友的拥护和支持，除正点工作外，要多修一台机车，一辆客车，五辆货车，作为对“七一”的献礼。在进行生产中，新近有些部门又变更了劳动组织，订立了联系合同，消灭工作空隙，改善了工作方法，因而提高了生产效率。各场各班都提出来保证正点完成任务。大家说：“咱厂四、五两个月任务都超过的很多，在工作中还有些毛病，六月份要去掉毛病好好干，还要争夺第二期全国模范厂的大红旗呢。”我们大伙可高兴啦。当然我们绝不停止我们的努力，我们要不断的克服工作中的困难和缺点，提高产量和质量，更好的完成并超过第二期的任务。祝你身体健康！
