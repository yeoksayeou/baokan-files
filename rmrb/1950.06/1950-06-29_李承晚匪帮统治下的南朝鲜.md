    Under the rule of the Li Chengwan gang, a faithful lackey of the United States, South Korea has been turned into a terrifying large prison and slaughterhouse. The broad masses of South Korean people are living in a hellish abyss, yearning for liberation.

    Under the command of the U.S. imperialists, the Li Chengwan gang, in order to divide Korea and maintain its corrupt and reactionary rule, established a brutal reign of terror in South Korea. In the five years since, the number of Korean patriots massacred by the South Korean reactionaries has even exceeded the record during the Japanese imperialist rule of Korea. According to statistics, the number of Korean patriotic people massacred was 15 in 1945, more than 4,200 in 1946, 3,800 in 1947, more than 32,000 in 1948, 53,000 by the end of July 1949, and 62,000 in the second half of 1949. The total number of those massacred reached about 150,000. The number of people arrested totaled 478,000 by the end of July 1949. There are currently 154,000 people in prison. All available houses, including factory warehouses, have been used as prisons, but each six to eight prisoners only occupy 3.3 square meters of space. Therefore, the Li Chengwan gang greatly expanded old prisons and built new prisons.

    Under this bloody rule of the Li Chengwan group, the South Korean people have no freedom of speech or association. Since May 1948, when the Li Chengwan gang began its criminal rule under the protection of American bayonets, a total of 59 newspapers and periodicals have been closed down, and all progressive newspapers and periodicals have been completely shut down. In the second half of last year, after the establishment of the Korean Fatherland United Front, a total of 162 patriotic political parties and social groups in South Korea were declared illegal. Their leaders were either imprisoned and killed, or forced to go underground to struggle.

    The Li Chengwan army implements a brutal three-all policy in areas where the people's guerrillas are active. Taking Jeju Island as an example, more than 30,000 residents were massacred from the winter of 1948 to the spring of 1949, and 295 of the island's more than 400 villages were burned down. In the "winter suppression" last winter and this spring, according to incomplete statistics, more than 155,000 homes of the people were burned down. In order to eliminate the people's guerrillas, Li Chengwan sometimes ordered the residents of areas where the guerrillas were active to be expelled. As soon as the order was issued, the local residents were immediately deprived of their families, property, livestock, and crops, and ordered to leave the country within five days. The total number of South Korean people displaced as a result is at least three million.

    The economic life of the South Korean people is extremely miserable. South Korea is mainly an agricultural area. However, landlords, who account for 3.4 percent of the total population, occupy 63 percent of all arable land, while more than 80 percent of farmers have no land. In addition to handing over 60 to 70 percent of the annual harvest as rent to the landlords, farmers also have to bear the heavy grain levies and purchases of the Li Chengwan government. The summer grain levy, which did not even exist during the Japanese occupation, has increased from 700,000 *shi* in 1947 to 900,000 *shi* in 1948. This year's autumn grain levy will increase by another one million *shi* compared to last year. Due to natural disasters and man-made calamities, the 1949 harvest was 50 percent less than in 1948, but Li Chengwan forcibly requisitioned more than 4.2 million *shi* of summer and autumn grain, of which the price of 3.57 million *shi* of autumn grain requisitioned was only one-sixth of the market price. As a result of this exploitation, South Korean farmers, despite their year-round hard work, are still struggling on the brink of starvation.

    The Li Chengwan gang forced farmers to convert large tracts of fertile paddy fields into mulberry fields for silkworm breeding, and as a result, forcibly purchased silk at less than one-fifth of the market price and transported it to the United States.

    During the period of Japanese rule, South Korea's cotton production reached more than 210 million *jin* per year, while in 1949, only 43.5 million *jin* were produced. At present, 80 percent of the raw cotton required by the South Korean textile industry is imported from the United States.

    Under the cruel exploitation of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the Li Chengwan traitorous clique, South Korea's agricultural productivity is shrinking at an alarming rate. The cultivated area in 1948 was 34 percent less than the average for 1940-1944. The average yield for 1945-1947 was 21 percent less than for 1940-1944. In March of last year, the total number of draught cattle was 799,000, but by March of this year, it had suddenly decreased by 329,000 in one year.

    The Japanese Oriental Colonization Company, which sucked the blood and sweat of the Korean people during the Japanese imperialist rule, was replaced by the signboard of the American "New Korea" Co., Ltd. This company concentrated all the industries of South Korea and the previous Japanese assets. Due to the dumping of American goods, by January 1949, two-thirds of the original industrial and commercial enterprises had gone bankrupt. In Yeongdeungpo, the industrial center of South Korea, only 5 percent of the industrial enterprises are still operating normally. Due to the collapse of industry, hundreds of thousands of workers have lost their jobs and are struggling on the brink of starvation.

    In the various cities of South Korea, 100,000 households of citizens have no houses to live in, and there are 30,000 households in Seoul alone. They live in awnings, earth caves, and air-raid shelters, living like beasts of burden. The health and healthcare situation in various places is extremely bad. For example, more than half of the areas in Jeolla Province have no hospitals or doctors. Eighty percent of the miners in the Sapsam coal mine in Gangwon Province suffer from lung disease, and 50 percent of them are in critical condition.

    The South Korean people are not willing to be slaves of U.S. imperialism and the Li Chengwan gang. As early as March 1948, they organized people's guerrillas and carried out an unyielding armed struggle to overthrow the Li Chengwan gang. As of August last year, the areas of activity of the South Korean people's guerrillas had expanded to 8 *do*, 7 *shi*, 118 *xian*, and 682 *qu* out of all 8 *do*, 15 *shi*, 133 *xian*, and 1,528 *qu* in South Korea. Now, the day of final reckoning for the broad masses of the South Korean people and the people's guerrillas with the rule of the Li Chengwan gang has arrived. They will win a glorious victory in the struggle for liberation in this war provoked by the Li Chengwan gang.

### 李承晚匪帮统治下的南朝鲜

　　李承晚匪帮统治下的南朝鲜
    在美国的忠实走狗李承晚匪帮的统治下，南朝鲜被变成了一个骇人听闻的大监狱和大屠场。广大的南朝鲜人民，正生活在水深火热的地狱中，渴望获得解放。
    在美帝国主义指挥下的李承晚匪帮为了分裂朝鲜，并维持其腐朽而反动的统治，在南朝鲜建立了残暴的恐怖统治。五年以来，为南朝鲜反动派所屠杀的朝鲜爱国人民，甚至超过了日本帝国主义统治朝鲜时的纪录。据统计，朝鲜爱国人民被屠杀的，在一九四五年有十五人，一九四六年有四千二百多人，一九四七年有三千八百人，一九四八年有三万二千多人，一九四九年到七月底，有五万三千人，一九四九年下半年，六万二千人。总计被屠杀者共达十五万人左右。被捕的人数，到一九四九年七月底止，共达四十七万八千人。现在监狱里的共有十五万四千人。一切可利用的房屋，包括工厂的仓库，都作了监狱，但每六个到八个囚犯，只占三·三方公尺的地方。因此，李承晚匪帮曾经大事扩充旧监狱，并建筑新监狱。
    在李承晚集团这种血腥的统治下，南朝鲜人民根本无言论和结社自由权利的可言。自一九四八年五月李承晚匪帮在美国刺刀的保护下，开始其罪恶的统治以后，被封闭的报刊共达五十九种，进步报刊被全部封闭。去年下半年，在朝鲜祖国统一战线成立以后，南朝鲜共有一百六十二个爱国政党和社会团体被宣布非法。它们的领袖不是被监禁与杀害，就是被迫转入地下斗争。
    李承晚匪军对人民游击队活动的地区，实行残酷的三光政策。以济州岛为例，自一九四八年冬至一九四九年春，被屠杀的居民共达三万人以上，全岛四百多个村庄被烧去二百九十五个。在去冬今春的“冬季讨伐”中，据不完全的统计，人民房屋被烧毁的达十五万五千户以上。李承晚为了要消灭人民游击队，有时下令把游击队活跃地区的居民，一律驱逐出境。命令一下，当地居民就立刻被剥夺了家庭、财产、牲畜和庄稼，并限五天之内扫数离境。南朝鲜人民因此流离失所的总计至少有三百万人。
    南朝鲜人民的经济生活，是十分悲惨的。南朝鲜主要是农业区。但占全人口百分之三·四的地主，占据着全部耕地的百分之六十三，而百分之八十以上的农民，则没有土地。农民除了要将全年收获量的百分之六十至七十作为地租交给地主之外，还要负担李承晚政府苛重的征粮和征购。在日寇时代亦不曾有过的夏谷征收，已由一九四七年的七十万石，增加到一九四八年的九十万石。今年的秋粮征收，又要比去年增加一百万石。一九四九年的收成，因天灾人患，比一九四八年减少百分之五十，但李承晚却强制征购夏粮和秋粮四百二十余万石，其中征购秋粮三百五十七万石的价格，仅及市价的六分之一。由于这种榨取的结果，南朝鲜的农民虽然终年勤劳，结果却仍然是在饥饿线上挣扎。
    李承晚匪帮强迫农民将大片肥沃的稻田，改为桑田养蚕，结果以不到市价五分之一的价格强制收购蚕丝，输往美国。
    日寇统治时期，南朝鲜的棉花生产，每年达二亿一千余万斤，而一九四九年，仅生产四千三百五十万斤。现时南朝鲜纺织工业所需的原棉，百分之八十都是由美国输入。
    在美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚卖国集团的残酷剥削下，南朝鲜农业生产力萎缩的数字是十分惊人的。一九四八年的耕地面积，比一九四○——一九四四年的平均数，减少了百分之三十四。一九四五——一九四七年的平均产量，比一九四○——一九四四年减少了百分之二十一。去年三月，耕牛总数为七十九万九千头，到今年三月，一年中竟骤减了三十二万九千头。
    日本帝国主义统治时代吸吮朝鲜人民血汗的日本东方殖民株式会社，被换上了美国“新韩”股份有限公司的招牌，这个公司集中了南朝鲜的全部工业和先前日本的资财。由于美国商品的倾销，到一九四九年一月，原有的工商企业共倒闭了三分之二。南朝鲜的工业中心永登浦，还在正常开办的工业企业，仅及原来的百分之五。由于工业崩溃，又有数十万工人失业，挣扎在饥饿线上。
    在南朝鲜的各个城市中，有十万户市民没有房屋住，仅汉城一地就有三万户。他们住在天幕、土洞和防空壕里，过着牛马般的生活。各地的卫生和保健情况极端恶劣。如全罗南道一半以上的地区没有医院和医生。江源南道三涉煤矿的矿工百分之八十都患肺病，其中有百分之五十的人，病情都很危险。
    南朝鲜人民是不甘心做美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的奴隶的。他们早在一九四八年三月，就组织了人民游击队，为打倒李承晚匪帮进行了不屈不挠的武装斗争。截至去年八月止，南朝鲜人民游击队的活动地区，在全部南朝鲜八道、十五市、一三三县、一五二八区中，已扩展到八道、七市、一一八县、六八二区。现在，南朝鲜的广大人民和人民游击队最后清算李承晚匪帮统治的日子，已经到来了。他们将在李承晚匪帮所挑起来的这次战争中，取得解放斗争的光荣胜利。
