Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 10th. Wuhan City Cooperative Headquarters and the Handicraft Workers' Union have worked hard to lead individual handicraft workers to form fifteen handicraft production cooperatives and four joint processing factories. This is one of the effective ways to solve the unemployment of handicraft workers. The above-mentioned cooperatives and factories include eight industries such as clothing, knitting, leather, shoe making, and weights and measures. A total of more than 9,000 members participated in production, most of whom were unemployed and semi-unemployed handicraft workers in the past. Now, the monthly salary of each person can generally maintain the lives of three people. Members of the production cooperative each join at least one share and participate in production with their own tools. Handicraft workers with particularly difficult lives are first absorbed into the cooperative as members, and then pay the shares in installments.

Most of the products of the cooperatives are sold by the cooperatives themselves or sold on consignment by consumer cooperatives. A small number of cooperatives lacking funds are entrusted by state-owned enterprises to process and order goods in a planned way to maintain production. As a result, more than 2,800 handicraft workers have been spared from unemployment.

Under the leadership of the City Cooperative Headquarters and the Handicraft Workers' Union, the production cooperatives and processing factories have achieved centralized management and unified planning, and have begun to overcome the blindness of individual production in the past, as well as the uneven quality of products and sluggish sales. They have also reduced costs and improved output and quality. For example, the Liberation Clothing Production Cooperative centralized thirteen sewing machines and produced ten dozens of shirts per day, which is 10% more efficient than decentralized production. The products are more refined than those on the market, and the cost is 22.9% lower than the market price. The cloth shoes made by the Hankou Cloth Shoe Cooperative cost 19,000 yuan per pair, which is 3,000 yuan lower than the general cost, and the quality is also higher than the general products. Because of the low cost and high quality, the sales of the finished products of each cooperative have been rapidly opened up. For example, the Hankou Cloth Shoe Production Cooperative has more than 20 consumer cooperatives undertaking the sales of its products. The Liberation Clothing Production Cooperative has had no inventory since its establishment two months ago.

　　解决手工业工人失业的有效办法
    武汉组织生产合作社         
    并成立四个联营加工厂
    【新华社汉口十日电】武汉市合作总社和手工业工会努力领导个体手工业者已组成十五个手工业生产合作社和四个联营加工厂。这是解决手工业工人失业的有效办法之一。上述合作社和工厂，包括被服、针织、皮革、鞋业、度量衡等八种行业，参加生产的社员共有九千余人，其中大部过去是失业和半失业的手工业工人；现每人每月所得工资，一般都能维持三口人的生活。生产合作社社员，每人至少加入一股，并自带工具参加生产，生活特别困难的手工业者，都先吸收其入社为社员，然后分期补交股金。
    合作社大部产品都由合作社自己推销，或委托消费合作社代销。少数缺乏资金的合作社则由国营企业有计划地委托加工、订货、维持生产。这样做的结果，已使二千八百余手工业工人免于失业。
    生产合作社和加工厂在市合作总社和手工业工会的领导下，做到集中管理和统一计划，开始克服了手工业者过去个体生产时的盲目性以及产品质量参差不齐、销路呆滞等现象，并降低了成本，提高了产量和质量。如解放被服生产合作社集中十三部缝纫机，每日产十打衬衣，较分散生产时效率提高百分之十，出品较市面上的细致，成本也比市价低百分之二十二点九。汉口布鞋合作社所制布鞋，每双成本一万九千元，较一般成本低三千元，质量也高于一般出品。各社成品由于成本低、质量高，销路因之迅速打开。如汉口布鞋生产合作社即有二十余个消费合作社承销其产品。解放被服生产合作社成立两个月来社内始终没有存货。
