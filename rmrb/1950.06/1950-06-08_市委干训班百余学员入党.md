    The fifth class of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Cadre Training School started on March 10th of this year, with 1,400 students, all of whom are employees of various state-owned factories and enterprises. In the two months since the start of the school, the students have studied Historical Materialism, the General Program of the Party Constitution, etc., and have generally improved their class consciousness, and have actively requested to join the Chinese Communist Party. Those applying to join the Party accounted for 82 percent of the non-Party students. The first group of 174 people held their oath-taking ceremony on June 1st.
