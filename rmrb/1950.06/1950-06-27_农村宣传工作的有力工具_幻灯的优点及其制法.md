A Powerful Tool for Rural Propaganda Work:
    Advantages and Production of Lantern Slides

  (I) "Native Movies" Beloved by Farmers
    People's Cultural Centers in many counties of Shanxi and Hebei provinces are constantly using lantern slides for propaganda work. Based on current events, policies, and the central work of the area, they create slides targeting the masses' thoughts in a planned way, and show them deep in the countryside, inspiring the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for production and construction. For example, the Zuoquan County Cultural Center in Shanxi visited labor models and collected true stories to create new lantern slides; Xiyang County used lantern slides to cooperate with spring plowing and epidemic prevention propaganda; Jinyuan County promoted production policies through lantern slides, encouraging farmers to get rich, all of which achieved good propaganda results.

    Farmers like lantern slides very much. They call lantern slides "native movies." When Wu乡 County in Shanxi province showed lantern slides in Yuanquan Village, farmers within 20 *li* nearby rushed to watch. From March of last year to January of this year, the Lucheng County Cultural Center performed lantern slides 89 times in the city and 55 villages, with an audience of 58,920 people. Many cadres and masses competed to invite the lantern slide team to perform.

  (II) Advantages of Lantern Slides
    Experiences in various places have proved that, under the current conditions, lantern slides are one of the powerful and popular cultural propaganda tools, which are in line with the current rural situation.

    First, lantern slides are easy to make and inexpensive. People's Cultural Centers in various places can make them themselves. Shanxi counties have manufactured a total of 28 lantern slides in the past year or so. The Changli County People's Cultural Center in Hebei Province has manufactured 13 lantern slides in the past six months for the counties in the Tangshan Special District to show. According to the Changli Cultural Center's estimate, the cost of labor and materials for each lantern slide (including gasoline lamps, condensing lenses, magnifying glasses, etc.) is only 450 *jin* of millet.

    Second, the lantern slide equipment is simple and easy to carry. Each lantern slide performance only requires two people, and at most five or six people. It can go everywhere in remote areas, which is much simpler than showing movies, performing dramas, or holding exhibitions.

    Third, lantern slides are quick to produce. Materials can be collected in time, and propaganda can be carried out in cooperation with the central work. New slides can be replaced and added at any time, which is more flexible than stage plays and movies.

    Fourth, although lantern slides are not as moving as movies, their content is popular, good-looking, and easy to understand. At present, farmers sometimes find it difficult to understand movies. Lantern slides can use local materials to draw colorful comic strips, plus detailed explanations, so that the old ladies in the countryside also feel intimate and easy to understand.

    Based on these conditions, lantern slides can be widely promoted.

  (III) Production of Lantern Slide Boxes
    Over the past year, the cultural centers in various counties of Shanxi and Hebei that show lantern slides have researched and experimented with self-made light boxes. They have continuously improved in the projection process and created various forms. Here is an introduction to the process of creating light boxes by the Xiyang County Cultural Center in Shanxi.

    The first light box made by the Xiyang Cultural Center was extremely simple. A square wooden box was used, with a round hole opened on the top to embed a gasoline lamp, a hole opened on one side to pass light, cover and release the lantern slide, and then a magnifying glass was placed in front. Although this could be projected, it was not easy to accurately adjust the light, and the wooden box would soon be scorched by the gasoline lamp. After repeated improvements by the staff of the museum, most of the light boxes now used are made of tinplate, which is not afraid of burning. The entire box is one foot and three inches long, eight inches high, and weighs four *jin*. It can be disassembled for easy carrying and the light is accurate.

    The light box is simple to make. Use a piece of wooden board one foot and three inches long and saw it into a "tennis racket" shape, called the base. Drill many small holes in the center of one end of the base for heat dissipation. Place a circular tinplate light box on top, put a gasoline lamp inside, and add a tinplate cover on top. A piece of tinplate is placed on one side of the box, inlaid with tin foil as a reflector, and a lamp port is opened on the other side. The lamp port is covered with an outer cover, which protects the single convex lens and allows the film to pass through smoothly without distortion or damage. A front-round and rear-square light-emitting tube is placed in front of the lamp port. One end of the light-emitting tube is equipped with a tinplate piece as a light gate, which is connected with an iron wire and can be opened and closed freely for replacing films. The other end is sleeved into a small cylinder inlaid with a double convex lens as a lens, which can be moved back and forth for focusing. The light-emitting tube is connected to the base with two wooden boards plus iron strips, screws, and small wooden plugs. After the projection is completed, it can be disassembled and carried.

  (IV) Production of Lantern Slides
    To make lantern slides, transparent colors can be used to paint on white cellophane or glass sheets. Cellophane is easy to draw on. After drawing, two pieces of glass can be clamped together or a cardboard frame can be added for use; however, cellophane is prone to wrinkling and damaging the picture after coloring. Before painting on glass sheets, they must be coated with rosin alcohol first (one *liang* of alcohol plus two *qian* of pure rosin powder, quickly and evenly apply a layer with a small hemp brush at noon when the sunlight is strong and there is no wind), so that it is easy to color and will not fall off; after drawing, a layer of colored or white cellophane can be covered to protect the picture.

    Long strip comic strip films can depict a complete story, and sometimes they can also be made into "double-layer active films": two drawing strips are used, one strip is painted with still life pictures; the other strip is painted with people, animals, airplanes, vehicles and ships, etc. When projecting, repeat the two films, and slowly move the latter to show scenes of horses galloping and airplanes soaring.

    During the projection, there is generally a special person who uses a loudspeaker to give detailed explanations; some are also equipped with music and sound effects, which can make the projected scenes more realistic and moving. The Changli Cultural Center's projection of "Liu Hulan" won thunderous applause from the audience because of the good coordination of sound effects and songs.

### 农村宣传工作的有力工具  幻灯的优点及其制法

　　农村宣传工作的有力工具
    幻灯的优点及其制法
  （一）农民热爱的“土电影”
    山西、河北两省许多县的人民文化馆，不断利用幻灯进行宣传工作。他们根据当前的时事、政策和当地的中心工作，针对群众思想，有计划地绘制片子，深入农村放映，鼓舞了广大农民生产建设的热情。如山西左权县文化馆访问了劳动模范，搜集真人真事来制作幻灯新片；昔阳县以幻灯配合春耕和防疫宣传；晋源县通过幻灯宣传生产政策，鼓励农民发家致富，都收到了很好的宣传效果。
    农民非常喜欢幻灯。他们把幻灯称为“土电影”。山西武乡县在源泉村放映幻灯时，附近二十里内的农民都赶去看。潞城县文化馆去年三月至今年一月，在城内和五十五个村庄演出幻灯八十九次，观众达五万八千九百二十人。许多干部和群众，争着邀幻灯队去放映。
  （二）幻灯的优点
    各地的经验证明，在目前条件下，幻灯是一种有力的大众化的文化宣传工具之一，它切合目前农村的情况。
    第一，幻灯制造容易，成本低廉。各地人民文化馆均可自制。山西各县年余来共制造了幻灯二十八具。河北省昌黎县人民文化馆半年来制造了幻灯十三具，供唐山专区各县放映。据昌黎文化馆估计，每具幻灯的工料费（连汽灯、聚光镜、放大镜等在内）仅需小米四百五十斤。
    第二，幻灯设备简单，携带轻便。每具幻灯出映，有的只用两个人，最多也只要五、六人。穷乡僻壤到处可以去，比放映电影、演剧、开展览会都简便得多。
    第三，幻灯制片快，可以及时收集材料，配合中心工作进行宣传，可以随时更换、增添新片，比话剧、电影灵活。
    第四，幻灯虽不如电影动人，但它取材通俗，好看易懂。目前农民对电影有时还不易了解。幻灯可以就地取材，绘成五彩连环画，再加上详细的讲解，农村的老大娘们也感到亲切好懂。
    根据这些条件，幻灯可以大量地推广。
  （三）幻灯箱的制法
    山西、河北各县放映幻灯的文化馆，一年来研究试验，自制灯箱。在放映中不断改进，创造了各种形式。这里把山西昔阳县文化馆创制灯箱的过程介绍一下吧。
    昔阳文化馆最初制的灯箱，极为简单。用一个四方木箱，顶上开一个圆洞嵌进汽灯，一面开一个洞，通过光线，遮放幻灯片，再在前面安置一个放大镜。这样虽然可以放映，但对光不容易准确，而且木箱使用不久就会被汽灯烤焦。经该馆人员多次改进，现在使用的灯箱大部是用洋铁片制成的，不怕烧烤。全箱长一尺三寸，高八寸，重四斤。携带时可以拆开，非常方便，而且对光准确。
    灯箱制法简单。用一块一尺三寸长的木板锯成“球拍”形，叫做底座。底座的一端中央钻许多小孔，起散热作用。上置圆形的洋铁灯箱，内放汽灯，上面加上洋铁盖。箱内一侧配一块洋铁片，镶上锡箔作返光镜，另一侧开一灯口。灯口套上一个外罩，一面保护单凸镜，一面可使影片平平地穿过去，不致歪曲或损坏。灯口前面放置前圆后方的放光筒。放光筒的一端安置一块洋铁片作光门，用一根铁丝连着，可以自由开闭，以便更换影片。另一端套入一个镶着双凸镜的小圆筒作镜头，可以前后移动，以便对光。放光筒用两片木板加上铁条、螺丝、小木塞等连接在底座上。放映完毕，可以拆卸携带。
  （四）幻灯片的制法
    制幻灯片，可用透明颜色绘在白色玻璃纸或玻璃片上。玻璃纸绘制容易，绘成后可用两片玻璃夹住或加上硬纸框，以便使用；但玻璃纸着色后容易起绉纹，常常损坏画面。玻璃片绘制以前，须先涂上松香酒（一两酒精加上二钱纯净的松香末，在日光强烈无风的中午，以小麻刷很快地均匀地涂上一层），始容易着色，不致脱落；绘成后可罩上一层有色或白色玻璃纸，以保护画面。
    长条的连环图画影片可以描写一个完整的故事，有时还可以制成“双层活动影片”：用画片两条，一条绘上静物画面；另一条绘上人、兽、飞机、车船等。放映时将两片重复，把后者徐徐移动，可映出人马奔驰、飞机翱翔的场面。
    放映时，一般都有专人以扬声筒作详细讲解；有的还配以音乐和声响，可使映出的场面更真切动人。昌黎文化馆所放映的《刘胡兰》，因为音响、歌曲配合得好，博得观众如雷的掌声。（本文材料大部系昌黎文化馆赵乃耕同志及昔阳文化馆王希圣、尹兴晋同志所供给）
