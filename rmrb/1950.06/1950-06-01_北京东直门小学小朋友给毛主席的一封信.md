A Letter to Respected Chairman Mao from Children of Dongzhimen Elementary School, Beijing:

　　Respected Chairman Mao:
    International Children's Day, "June 1st," has arrived. We have already written many letters to foreign children and agreed to write to our own leader on this day.
    Thanks to your wise leadership and the arduous struggle of the People's Liberation Army, the people of all of China have been liberated. Children have also gained happiness and freedom.
    A few days ago, the school launched a signature campaign to support world peace. Everyone enthusiastically signed their names because we need lasting peace and oppose wars of aggression.
    To celebrate "June 1st," the school has prepared many programs. We will also invite labor heroes and mothers to participate!
    Finally, we assure you: We must study hard, exercise, and be ready at all times to struggle for the construction of the motherland and for the realization of the great ideals of mankind.
    We respectfully wish you good health!
    Student Union of Dongzhimen National Elementary School, Third District, Beijing

　　北京东直门小学小朋友给毛主席的一封信敬爱的毛主席：
    “六一”国际儿童节到了。我们已经写了许多信给外国的小朋友，并约定在这一天要给自己的领袖写信。
    由于您英明的领导和人民解放军的艰苦奋斗，全中国的人民得到了解放。儿童们也得到了幸福和自由。
    前两天，学校里展开了拥护世界和平的签名运动。大家都热烈地签了名。因为我们需要持久和平，反对侵略战争。
    为了庆祝“六一”，学校里准备了许多节目。还要请劳动英雄和母亲们参加呢！
    最后我们向您保证：我们一定要好好学习，锻炼身体，时刻准备着为建设祖国的事业、为实现人类的伟大理想而奋斗。
    敬祝身体健康！
