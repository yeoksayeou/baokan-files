To the Editor:

　　The Railway Corps Sixth Detachment, while repairing the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, requested assistance from the Railway Bureau in GuiSui area with some employees due to insufficient personnel during the restoration of Daiyue Station. At 9:00 PM on May 21st, due to the large number of parked vehicles at the station and only four tracks available, the first track was a dead end because the south head crossover was under repair, only able to hold vehicles but not reverse them. The third and fourth tracks were also difficult for shunting due to too many parked vehicles. Only the second track could be used for shunting. Furthermore, the newly repaired line had a maximum speed of three kilometers per hour, and there were no lighting facilities at night, which added some objective difficulties in assembling trains. In addition, the technical skills of the staff were low, and the shunting plan was not precise enough. As a result, the material train scheduled to depart at 4:00 AM on the 22nd was delayed until 6:35 AM, a delay of two hours and thirty-five minutes, affecting the track repair work ahead. This is something the relevant staff should seriously examine.

　　However, Captain Yin of the Railway Corps Sixth Detachment, without investigating the cause of the delay, summoned Bai Haixiang, a staff member of the station, to the command vehicle and flew into a rage, slapping him several times, causing him to bleed from the mouth. He even arrested Comrade Bai Haixiang.

　　Captain Yin's violation of military discipline and arbitrary infringement of human rights, exhibiting a warlord-like style, has had a very bad influence on the employees. We hope that Comrade Yin will conduct a thorough self-criticism and publicly admit his mistakes in the newspaper.

　　铁道兵团六支队尹队长
    随便殴打铁路员工编辑同志：
    抢修同蒲北段的铁道兵团六支队，在修复岱岳站时，因人员不敷分配，经洽商由铁路局从归绥地区调来一部员工协助工作。五月二十一日二十一点，因该站停留车辆很多，站上仅有四股道。第一股道因南头岔子正在复修，成为死道，只能停留车辆不能倒车。第三、四股道也因车辆停留过多不易调车。只有第二股道能调车。又因新修路线行车速度最高每小时三公里，夜间又无照明设备，在实行编组列车上增加了一些客观上的困难。再加上工作人员技术能力低，调车计划不够精密。以致预定在二十二日四点开出的材料列车，延至六点三十五分始编好开出，误时两点三十五分，影响了前方修道工程。这是有关的职工们应该认真检讨的。
    可是铁道兵团六支队队长尹同志，不调查误点的原因，将该站工作人员白海祥叫到指挥车上，大发雷霆，打了他好几个嘴巴子，打得顺嘴流血，还把白海祥同志押起来。
    铁道兵团六支队队长尹同志这种违反军纪，任意侵犯人权的军阀主义作风，已在职工中造成很坏的影响。希望尹同志作深刻检讨，并在报纸上公开承认错误。
