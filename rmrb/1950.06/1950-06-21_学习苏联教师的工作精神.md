　　Learning the Working Spirit of Soviet Teachers
    Su Xing, Renmin University of China
    For six months, the working spirit of the Soviet teachers at Renmin University of China has provided great education and inspiration to all the students and cadres.

  I

    The greatest advantage of the Soviet teachers is their creativity in their work. Under the leadership of Professor Chevichkova, Renmin University of China established the Russian Language Teaching and Research Office, planning and researching the entire Russian language teaching work. At various meetings of the Teaching and Research Office, teaching programs were discussed, experiences were summarized, student opinions were discussed, teaching materials and examinations were studied, and academic and research reports were made, with the single-minded purpose of creating the most effective method for teaching Chinese students to learn Russian.

    The experimental group of the Russian Language Training Class, personally fostered by teacher Maksimova, once created a typical example of teaching Russian in non-Russian schools. In this class, after only three and a half months of study, the following achievements were made: students had learned more than 1,500 prototype words, they wrote after-action reports in Russian on the "Moscow Character," wrote simple Russian autobiographies, and in two exams, an average of 93 percent of students received scores of five and four.

    But they did not stick to a rigid method. When they began teaching Russian to undergraduate worker-peasant cadre students, they re-experimented with the effectiveness of these teaching methods. After a few days of class, they summarized the teaching of Russian to university undergraduates at a meeting of the Teaching and Research Office.

    Soviet teachers, in the selection of teaching materials and teaching methods, deeply understood the students' learning situation and paid attention to the teaching effect at all times. They listened to the students' opinions and modified the teaching materials. They went into the actual struggle to select teaching materials. When teaching conversation, they were good at combining it with daily life.

    Their teaching plans often solicited students' opinions first. Chevichkova, the director of the Teaching and Research Office, immediately went to each team to listen to the class whenever she heard students' feedback on teaching, and promptly solved the problems existing in teaching.

    When teacher Maksimova started her experimental group teaching, she first connected with daily life and taught the students conversation. At that time, some students and cadres, constrained by old experiences, had great doubts about her teaching methods. But she persisted in teaching, and in the middle of three months, she created amazing achievements, breaking all doubts.

    In a short period of about five months, Soviet teachers not only created a teaching method suitable for Chinese students to learn Russian, but also compiled and printed teaching materials suitable for teaching needs, and also helped and improved the teaching work of Soviet and Chinese teachers.

  II

    The second advantage of Soviet teachers in their work is their high degree of seriousness and responsibility.

    They are kind and amiable, with unlimited enthusiasm for work. When starting to give lectures, the students could not understand them at first. They were always patient and tried everything possible until every student understood. When students answered questions, they listened with great interest, patiently pointing out and correcting language errors.

    They always paid attention to every student in the class, regarding understanding the work of each student as an important condition for striving to make students achieve perfect results. They gave special care and encouragement to students with poor grades. As the students said: "You will get the teacher's warm encouragement for even a little progress." During class breaks and self-study time, they often went to correct students' pronunciation, correct calligraphy, and answer questions. They encouraged students to ask questions. Teacher Paultanina told students: "The more you ask, the more you will know."

    Every time the exercise books were handed to the teachers, they were always returned the next day. Every word and every punctuation mark was carefully corrected; if the mistake was made a second time, it was corrected again.

    They cherish the students' time. Teacher Zavyalova once came to the school in the morning, and before class started, she went to the classroom to write on the blackboard and draw pictures to save the students' time. They were never late. Once, teacher Baryshnikova's car broke down on the way to school, so she jumped out of the car and ran to the school in one breath, and looked at her watch in the classroom and said: "Sorry! Five minutes late." Seeing their spirit of observing time, the students also corrected the bad habits of being late and leaving early.

  III

    The third advantage of Soviet teachers is that they love their students and love their careers. They are full of internationalist spirit. They place their careers on the basis that teaching Chinese students Russian well is a glorious political task to strengthen the friendship and cultural exchanges between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union.

    Their love for students is not only manifested in caring about students' academic achievements, but also in caring about the political development, the courage to move forward, and the life and health of each student.

    In the classroom, as soon as they found that a student was in a bad mood, they would ask Chinese teachers and cadres to help them understand the reason for the student's bad mood and help him solve the problem.

    Fu Yingshen, a student of the Second Branch of the Russian Department, once said: "I am afraid that I will not be able to serve the people in the future because I am in poor health." After teacher Peiqichunwa heard this, she told him the story of the famous Soviet writer Ostrovsky, describing how he overcame his disability. Although he was blind and paralyzed, he finally wrote the famous novel "How Steel Was Tempered." This not only moved Fu Yingshen, but also educated the whole class.

    When students were sick, they gave care and condolences like mothers.

    Once, teacher Zavyalova was ill, but she insisted on teaching for two hours and tried not to let the students see that she was ill, because this would affect the students' mood in class. Similarly, the students were very concerned about the teacher's illness. They wrote letters of condolence, sent flowers, and sent representatives to express their sympathy.

    Soviet teachers love the cause of liberation of the Chinese people and admire our leader, Chairman Mao, even more. When Chairman Mao went to the Soviet Union, they told the students about almost every action that was published in the Soviet newspapers with great pleasure.

    Whenever news of a victory on the front lines of the Liberation War came, they would immediately tell the students as soon as they heard it. They sang and cheered with the students. At the same time, they told the students how Soviet youth celebrated the victory of their motherland, saying that they often used work and study plans as gifts to celebrate the victory of their motherland.

    Learning the working spirit of Soviet teachers, I think not only teachers should do this, but every cadre should do this.

　　学习苏联教师的工作精神
    中国人民大学  苏星
    六个月来，中国人民大学的苏联教师们的工作精神，给全校同学和干部以极大的教育和鼓舞。
  一
    苏联的教师们最大的优点，就是她们在工作上的创造性。在契维克娃教授的领导之下，中国人民大学建立了俄文教研室，计划和研究着整个的俄文教学工作。在教研室的各种会议上，讨论教学纲领，总结经验，讨论同学意见，研究教材与考试等问题，并作学术和研究的报告，一心一意地在创造着教中国学生学俄文最有效的方法。
    教师玛克西莫娃所亲手扶植的俄文专修班的实验组，曾经创造在非俄国学校讲授俄文的典型范例。在这个班里，仅仅经过三个半月的学习，就取得了如下的成绩：学生们已经学了一千五百多个原形字，他们用俄文写了《莫斯科性格》的观后感，写了简单的俄文自传，在两次考试中平均百分之九十三得到了五分和四分的成绩。
    但她们不墨守一种死板的方法，当她们开始对本科工农干部同学讲授俄文时，就重新实验这些教学法的效果，上课几天后，就在教研室的会议上作了对大学本科教授俄文的总结。
    苏联教师们在选定教材上和教学方法上，都是深入地了解同学学习情况，随时注意教学效果。她们听取同学的意见，对教材进行了修改。她们到实际斗争生活中去选取教学材料。在教会话时，她们善于和日常生活结合起来。
    她们的教学计划常常先征求同学的意见。教研室主任契维克娃每当听到同学对教学的反映时，便立刻到各队去听课，即时地解决教学中存在的问题。
    当教师玛克西莫娃开始她的实验组教学时，她首先就联系日常生活，教同学们的会话。当时一部分同学和干部，由于受了旧经验的束缚，对她的教学方法抱着很大的怀疑。但她坚持着教下去，三个月中间，创造了惊人的成绩，把一切怀疑都打破了。
    短短的五个月左右的时间，苏联教师们不仅创造了适合于中国学生学习俄文的教学法，而且编印了适合教学需要的教材，同时还帮助与提高了苏籍教员和中国教员的教学工作。
  二
    苏联教师们工作上第二个优点，就是她们高度的认真负责的精神。
    她们亲切和蔼，具有无限的工作热忱。在开始讲课时，同学还听不懂她们的话，她们总是耐心地，想尽一切办法，直到每个同学了解为止。当同学回答问题时，她们非常感觉兴趣地倾听着，耐心地指出和纠正语言上的错误。
    她们总是关注着全班的每一个学生。把了解每一个学生的工作，当作争取使学生得到完满成绩的重要条件。特别对成绩较差的同学予以关心和鼓励，正像同学讲的：“你有一点点进步，都会得到教师的热情的鼓励。”在下课和自习的时间，她们也常去给同学校正发音，改书法，解答问题。她们鼓励学生提问题。教师保尔他尼娜告诉学生：“你们问的多，就知道的多了。”
    每次练习本交给教师们，总是在第二天就发回来。每一个字、每个标点都仔细地改过；第二次错了照样更正。
    她们珍惜学生的时间。教师扎维亚洛娃，有一次早晨到学校，还没有到上课时间就到教室去写黑板和画图，以节省同学们的时间。她们从来不迟到。有一次教师巴雷士尼可娃在来校途中车子坏了，她就跳下车一气跑到学校，到教室看看表说：“对不起！迟到五分钟。”看到她们这种遵守时间的精神，学生们也纠正了迟到和早退的坏习惯。
  三
    苏联教师们的第三个优点，是热爱学生和热爱自己的事业。她们充沛着国际主义的精神。她们把自己的事业放在这样的基础上：教好中国学生的俄文，乃是加强中苏两大民族友谊和文化交流的光荣的政治任务。
    她们热爱同学不仅表现在关心着同学的学习成绩，而且关怀到每个同学在政治上的开展，同学们的前进的勇气以及生活和健康。
    在课堂上，一发现那个学生情绪不好，她们就要中国教员和干部帮助她们了解这个同学情绪不好的原因，帮助他解决问题。
    俄专二分队的学生傅英审有一次说：“我将来恐怕不能为人民服务，因为我身体不好。”教师裴祺春娃听到后，就对他讲苏联名作家奥斯托洛夫斯基的故事。叙述他怎样战胜了残废。虽然双目失明和半身不遂，但他终于写成了著名的小说《钢铁是怎样炼成的》。这不仅感动了傅英审，而且也教育了全班同学。
    同学们有了病，她们像母亲一样地给予关怀和慰问。
    有一次教师扎维亚洛娃病了，但她还坚持上了两小时的课，并且竭力不让学生看到她已经病了，因为这会影响学生们听课的情绪。同样地，学生们都很关心教师的病，他们写慰问信，送鲜花，派代表去慰问。
    苏联教师们热爱中国人民的解放事业，更爱戴我们的领袖——毛主席。毛主席到苏联去的时候，几乎每一个行动，只要在苏联报刊上揭载的，她们都以极愉快的心情告诉同学。
    每当解放战争前线上一个胜利的消息到来，只要她们先听到就立刻告诉同学。她们和同学一道歌唱欢呼。同时告诉同学，苏联青年是怎样欢庆他们祖国的胜利，说他们常常以工作和学习的计划来作为庆祝祖国胜利的献礼。
    学习苏联教师这种工作精神，我想不仅教师应该如此，每一个干部都应该如此。
