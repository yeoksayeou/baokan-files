Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th (TASS): "The Great Strength of Soviet Democracy" - this is the title of a Pravda editorial. The editorial says: The entire Soviet people are closely watching the work of the first session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The speeches made by the representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the grand platform of the Kremlin convincingly demonstrated the various achievements of the Soviet state's communist construction, and they expressed the Soviet people's love and loyalty to the wise Bolshevik Party and to Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people. Representatives of all nationalities cautiously and extensively discussed the main issues concerning the further economic and cultural development of our great motherland. Soviet representatives are servants of the people. In all his work, he strives to be a social worker of the Lenin and Stalin type, and he expresses tireless concern for strengthening the power and might of his own Soviet state. All the speeches made by the representatives of all nationalities at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union when reviewing the Soviet Union's national budget for 1950 were permeated with ardent concern for the interests of the country and the needs of the working people. The representatives regard serving the great cause of Lenin and Stalin selflessly and executing the entrustment of the voters—hundreds of millions of working people—without any shame as their supreme responsibility. The editorial continued: The most striking sign of Soviet democracy is the fact that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is attended by representatives of men and women of all nationalities living in our vast Soviet motherland, representatives of young, middle-aged and old communist builders, just as is the case with all our local organs of power.
	One of the greatest gains of the Party of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet system is that it has attracted women to actively participate in state administration.
	The editorial concluded: The Soviet people's deep concern for the interests of the Soviet state, for increasing production, and for developing everything progressive, is a characteristic of the socialist system, and it also vividly demonstrates the great strength of Soviet democracy. Soviet society harmoniously integrates the vital interests of each union republic, autonomous republic, and all socialist nationalities with the overall interests of the entire Soviet state. This was clearly demonstrated at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union when discussing the national budget.
