　　Brief Reports on Famine Preparations
    Siyang Adopts Three-Calculation Method to Enhance Mass Awareness of Famine Preparations
    ▲ Siyang in northern Jiangsu province is adopting a three-calculation method to prevent summer famine (calculating whether the wheat harvest is sufficient to eat; calculating the autumn harvest; and calculating the country's financial difficulties) to enhance mass awareness of preventing summer famine, and is mobilizing the planting of various melons and vegetables. The entire county has planted more than 4,777,000 melon seedlings in twenty days. The county's population is 500,000, averaging nine seedlings per person. It is estimated that each seedling can yield five to ten catties of melons, but this is still far from the county party committee's requirement of planting fifteen to twenty-five seedlings per person. Mobilization is continuing to meet the target.
    Jiujiang Proposes Concrete Measures
    ▲ Jiujiang, Jiangxi, has helped its 120,000 disaster victims through the serious spring famine. However, due to the severity of last year's disaster, the summer famine problem still exists. The county has specifically proposed several measures: (1) Continue to lead the masses in sideline production and strengthen the supply and marketing business of cooperatives. (2) Supply the masses with urgently needed daily necessities. For example, farmers in the sixth district urgently need the cooperative to purchase 100,000 catties of gypsum for them as fertilizer. (3) Rely on early-maturing crops as rations. (4) Legal rent reductions from landlords can also solve part of the food problem.
    Gaozhao Township, Jiaxing, Zhejiang, Advocates Thrift and Sideline Occupations
    ▲ Based on the experience of surviving the spring famine, Gaozhao Township, Jiaxing, Zhejiang, is actively preparing to survive the summer famine and has formulated preventive measures: advocating thrift, prohibiting excessive eating and use after silkworm cocoons are put on the market; applying more fertilizer to early-maturing crops, and rushing to plant green beans, cucumbers, eggplants, cowpeas, etc.; engaging in sideline production, such as digging tree roots and selling fruits; seizing opportunities to do more short-term labor; and developing free lending.
    Shangyou, Jiangxi, Inspects Famine Preparations
    ▲ Shangyou, Jiangxi, has organized a 33-member production and famine (summer) preparation inspection team to go to the countryside for inspection.
    Minzhu Township, Changsha, Hunan, Mobilizes Households to Formulate Plans
    ▲ Among the measures to prevent summer famine in Minzhu Township, Changsha County, Hunan, it is proposed: to continue to settle accounts with corrupt officials to solve the difficulties of dike repair and seed shortage. Landlords and rich peasants must make up for the dike work they owe. And mobilize households to formulate plans to ensure that they can survive the summer famine, and launch a challenge campaign to formulate plans.
