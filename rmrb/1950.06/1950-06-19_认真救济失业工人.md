    In order to relieve unemployed workers, the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Instructions on Relieving Unemployed Workers" and the "Provisional Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers." In his report "Striving for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation," Chairman Mao listed "earnestly carrying out relief work for unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals" as one of the eight important tasks of the state at present. The Central People's Government has decided to allocate 400 million catties of grain as an unemployment relief fund, and local people's governments will also allocate relief funds as appropriate. It has also been decided that in cities where unemployment worker relief is being carried out, unemployment worker relief committees will be established under the municipal people's governments to plan and guide all relief matters. This shows that the People's Government is very concerned about unemployed workers. Only a state led by the working class can carry out such unemployment relief work in a situation where the revolutionary war has not completely ended and the state's finances are still very difficult. After the implementation of this directive of the State Council in various places, the difficulties of unemployed workers in various places will be gradually alleviated.
    The phenomenon of worker unemployment is widespread in capitalist countries, and the unemployment situation is becoming increasingly serious. Only the socialist country of the Soviet Union has fundamentally solved the unemployment problem. New democratic countries are also gradually eliminating the phenomenon of unemployment. The Northeast Administrative Region of our country is close to eliminating unemployment, which is a recent example. However, on a national scale, the large unemployed population caused by the long-term rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism can only be fundamentally solved through a relatively long period of economic recovery and construction. After liberation, the old Chinese economy began to reorganize, and due to the blockade and bombing of coastal cities by the Kuomintang reactionary remnants, as well as natural disasters, some industrial and commercial enterprises experienced shutdowns, production cuts, and closures, which added a new group of unemployed workers. Of course, even so, the number of unemployed workers in our country is only about one-tenth of that in the United States, and they can be employed in a few years. But our country is responsible for unemployed workers, as evidenced by the instructions and measures promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government.
    The working class is the main force in our country's industrialization. Because China's industry is not yet developed, there are not many Chinese workers, and skilled workers are particularly lacking. Therefore, in order to relieve unemployed workers, it is not only necessary to help unemployed workers overcome difficulties, but more importantly, to preserve the strength of the working class for the country. This is an important and arduous task that must be solved jointly by mobilizing the strength of the entire society. The "Provisional Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers" stipulated by the State Council require that "in all cities where unemployment worker relief is being carried out, the administrative side or capitalists of all state-owned and private factories, workshops, and shops must pay 1% of the total amount of actual wages paid each month." This is completely correct. It is only natural for state-owned enterprises to pay this unemployment relief fee, and it is also appropriate for the capitalists of private enterprises to pay this fee. In the adjustment of industry and commerce, in order to help the capitalists solve the difficulties of maintaining production, many workers have adopted methods such as increasing production, reducing wages, saving money, taking turns taking unpaid leave, or voluntarily resigning, and even agreeing to the capitalists temporarily laying off some workers. Therefore, it is reasonable for the capitalists to pay 1% of the total wage amount to relieve unemployed workers. The State Council also stipulates that "employed workers and staff in the above-mentioned enterprises and dock transportation and other businesses should also pay 1% of their actual wages each month," which is also necessary. Workers all over the world are one family, and the working class must not sit idly by and ignore the difficulties of their class brothers. Relieving unemployed workers is equivalent to relieving employed workers themselves.
    However, simple relief cannot solve the unemployment problem. Unemployed workers should adopt methods of self-reliance through labor. The working class understands best the truth that "labor creates everything." Only through labor can we create conditions for our future full employment. The State Council stipulates that "relieving unemployed workers should be mainly based on providing work as a form of relief," mobilizing unemployed workers to participate in projects needed by the state and municipal construction undertakings. In this way, unemployed workers can not only maintain their livelihoods through their own labor, but also increase social wealth, and keep unemployed workers from being scattered, which is convenient for planned employment in the future. The production self-rescue and return to hometown production methods stipulated by the State Council are also to provide unemployed workers with opportunities to overcome their difficulties through labor. When possible and necessary, the government should organize vocational training for unemployed workers so that unemployed workers can acquire new skills and transfer to the production needed by society. As for the distribution of relief funds, it is a transitional measure for unemployed workers before they have the opportunity to obtain self-reliance through labor. We hope that unemployed workers can make good use of it. We believe that relying on the leadership of the People's Government, relying on the support of the entire society, and especially relying on the efforts of unemployed workers themselves, the phenomenon of unemployment will be gradually alleviated.

### 认真救济失业工人

    认真救济失业工人
    为了救济失业工人，中央人民政府政务院颁布了《关于救济失业工人的指示》和《救济失业工人暂行办法》。毛主席在“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”的报告中，把“认真地进行对于失业工人和失业知识分子的救济工作”，列为国家当前八项重要工作之一。中央人民政府已决定拨四亿斤粮食作为失业救济基金，各地人民政府亦将酌量拨付救济基金，并决定在举办失业工人救济的城市中，在市人民政府下设立失业工人救济委员会，以计划与指导一切救济事宜。这表示人民政府对于失业工人十分关切。在革命战争还未完全结束，国家财政还十分困难的情形下，只有工人阶级领导的国家才有可能举办这样的失业救济工作。政务院这一指示在各地实施之后，各地失业工人的困难，当可逐步减轻。
    工人失业的现象，在资本主义国家是普遍存在的，而且失业状况越来越严重。只有社会主义国家苏联才已经根本解决了失业问题。新民主主义国家，也在逐步消灭失业现象。我国的东北大行政区已经接近于消灭失业，就是一个最近的例子。但在全国范围来说，由于帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义长期统治而产生的广大的失业群，却要经过较长期的经济恢复与建设工作，才能根本解决。在解放以后，旧中国经济开始改组，加以国民党反动残余匪帮对沿海城市的封锁轰炸，以及灾荒等原因，部分工商业又发生了停工、减产与歇业等现象，因而又增加了一批新的失业工人。当然，就是这样，我国的失业工人也只约占美国的十分之一，而且几年以后就可以就业。可是我们的国家是对失业工人负责的，中央人民政府政务院所颁布的指示和办法就证明了这一点。
    工人阶级是我们国家工业化的主力。由于中国工业还不发达，中国工人还不多，技术工人尤为缺乏。因此，为了救济失业工人，不仅要帮助失业工人度过困难，更重要的是要为国家保存工人阶级的力量。这是一个重要的和艰巨的任务，必须动员整个社会的力量，共同解决。政务院规定的《救济失业工人暂行办法》中，要求“凡举办救济失业工人的城市中，所有国营、私营的工厂、作坊、商店的行政方面或资方，均须按月缴纳所付实际工资总额的百分之一”，这是完全正确的。国营企业应付出这一笔失业救济费是理所当然的，私营企业的资方付出这一笔费用，也是应当的。在调整工商业中，工人为了帮助资方解决维持生产的困难，许多工人采取了增加生产、减薪、节约、轮流停薪回家或自动停职等办法，甚至同意资方暂时裁减一部分工人。那么，由资方付出百分之一的工资总额，来救济失业工人，是合乎情理的。政务院又规定“上述各种企业及码头运输等事业的在业工人和职员，亦应按月缴纳所得实际工资百分之一”，这也是必要的。天下工人是一家，工人阶级决不能坐视自己阶级弟兄的困难而不顾。救济失业工人，即等于救济在业工人自己。
    但是，单纯救济是不能解决失业问题的。失业工人应该采取劳动自救的办法。工人阶级最懂得“劳动创造一切”的真理。只有劳动，才能创造自己将来充分就业的条件。政务院规定“救济失业工人，应以以工代赈为主”，发动失业工人，参加国家需要举办的工程和市政建设事业。这样，失业工人既可以自己的劳动维持自己的生活，又可以增加社会的财富，并且保持失业工人不致离散，便于将来有计划地就业。政务院规定的生产自救、回乡生产等办法，也是为了使失业工人获得机会，以劳动克服自己的困难。在可能和需要的时候，政府应当组织对于失业工人的转业训练，以便失业工人得到新的技能，转入社会所必需的生产。至于发放救济金，则是失业工人在没有获得劳动自救的机会以前的过渡办法，希望失业工人能善为运用。我们相信，依靠人民政府的领导，依靠整个社会的支援，特别是依靠失业工人自身的努力，失业现象是会逐步减轻的。
