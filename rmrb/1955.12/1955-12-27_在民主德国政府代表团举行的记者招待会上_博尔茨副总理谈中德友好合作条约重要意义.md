Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: At the press conference held here on the evening of the 25th by Dr. Lothar Bolz, member of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that the conclusion of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation "is the result of the good development of friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China." He pointed out that the cooperation between the 600 million people of China in Asia and the industrialized German Democratic Republic located in the heart of Europe is an important factor in defending peace.

In a speech to the 78 Chinese and foreign journalists attending the reception, Dr. Bolz first spoke about the great significance of the visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic. He said, "The People's Republic of China is a country that has close friendly relations with our country. The friendship between our two countries is already deeply rooted in our people." "Our government delegation's visit to the People's Republic of China is the beginning of a new chapter in the relationship between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China. It is the first time in history that a German head of government has visited China, and it is also the first time to visit an Asian country."

When talking about the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, Dr. Bolz pointed out that the government delegation's visit to China took place after the signing of the Moscow Treaty on September 20, 1955. The People's Republic of China is the second country to sign such a significant treaty with the German Democratic Republic. It is also the first time in history that the German state and China have concluded a treaty on a basis of complete equality.

Dr. Bolz elaborated on the content of the treaty in detail. He said that the preamble to the treaty stated the purpose of the treaty, which is to further develop and consolidate the friendly relations and cooperation between China and Germany, and at the same time, the two countries expressed their determination to make their contribution to maintaining and consolidating world peace and security. He pointed out that "the special attention paid by both contracting parties to the inviolability and security of the territories of the two countries will have an impact on the ideas of certain West Germans who seek to solve the German problem through the path of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." Bolz emphasized that the close cooperation between the two countries standing at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism will play a great role in defending peace in Europe, Asia, and the world. "We attach special importance to the treaty signed with the People's Republic of China and will do our best to implement it quickly and thoroughly."

When a reporter asked about the significance of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation for the reunification of Germany, Dr. Bolz replied: It strengthens the forces of peace in the whole of Germany and helps to consolidate peace in Europe, and peace in Europe is a prerequisite for the reunification of Germany. He believes that the unity of the Chinese and German people is a great obstacle to foreign interference in other countries' affairs.

Durber, Commercial Counselor of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, said in response to a question about trade between China and Germany: The People's Republic of China is one of the most important countries maintaining trade relations with the German Democratic Republic. Since 1951, the two countries have signed six trade agreements and three supplementary agreements. The trade volume between the two countries has been increasing every year. The trade volume in 1956 will increase to 375 percent of that in 1951. China is increasingly supplying the German Democratic Republic with goods and raw materials needed for people's lives and industry, and the German Democratic Republic is supplying China with optical precision instruments, machine tools, and complete sets of factory equipment. The number of experts from the German Democratic Republic helping China in its construction will triple in a few months. Close cooperation between the two countries in technology and science has played a great role in accelerating the socialist construction of both countries.

Regarding Sino-German cultural exchanges, Ambassador Fritz Große, Member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, pointed out with satisfaction the increasing expansion of Sino-German cultural exchange activities. He said: "The Sino-German Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed on the 25th shows the prospects for cultural cooperation between the two countries."

Peter Florin, Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee of the People's Chamber, answered reporters' questions about the reunification of Germany at the reception. He pointed out that the establishment of the German Democratic Republic has played a great role in the reunification and peace of Germany. He said that since 1949, militarism and fascism have been eliminated in the German Democratic Republic, and thus the rule of monopoly capitalists and Junker landlords has also been eliminated. The forces that opposed fascism in the past have seized power, and the agreements of the Allies during World War II and the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement have been realized. He reiterated the proposals of the German Democratic Republic at the Geneva Conference on the reunification of Germany, and said that the German Democratic Republic welcomes any proposals that can promote the reunification of Germany.

He added that the German Democratic Republic will continue to work to promote consultation, continue to pursue a peaceful and democratic policy, point the way for the democratic forces in West Germany, and provide them with support. With the German Democratic Republic as an example, the democratic movement in West Germany will rise, thereby helping to eliminate obstacles to the reunification of Germany.

When talking about the current international situation, Dr. Bolz said that at present, the great significance of the two major issues of establishing a collective security system and eliminating colonialism in international affairs is undeniable. They must not only be resolved, but they can certainly be resolved.

A reporter from the Egyptian News Agency asked about the policy of the government of the German Democratic Republic towards Middle Eastern countries, especially towards Egypt. Dr. Bolz cited the Joint Declaration of the Chinese and German Governments as an answer, which stated:
"Both sides declared their firm opposition to colonialism in any form, and they support all countries and peoples struggling for national independence and to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. They ... support the struggle of the people of North Africa for national self-determination, support the legitimate demands of the Arab countries and their opposition to being dragged into aggressive military blocs." Dr. Bolz continued, "This is the first declaration by the German government supporting the right of Asian and African peoples to national self-determination."

Dr. Bolz said that his visits to China and Korea left a deep impression on him. He said that he had extensive contact with workers, farmers, scientists, and young people in China and Korea, and he expressed his admiration for the labor people were putting into building a new life. He said that the delegation visited many places in China and saw that China, in its socialist construction, not only retained its ancient culture, but also gained new life.

    在民主德国政府代表团举行的记者招待会上
    博尔茨副总理谈中德友好合作条约重要意义
    新华社二十六日讯　德意志民主共和国政府代表团团员、副总理兼外交部长洛塔·博尔茨博士二十五日晚在这里的记者招待会上说，中德友好合作条约的缔结，“是德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国友好关系良好发展的结果”。他指出亚洲六亿人口的中国人民和位于欧洲心脏的工业发达的德意志民主共和国的合作，是保卫和平的重要因素。
    博尔茨博士在向参加招待会的七十八位中外记者发表的谈话中，首先谈到德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问的重大意义。他说，“中华人民共和国是同我国有着密切友好关系的国家。我们两国的友谊在我们的人民中已经是根深蒂固了。”“我们政府代表团访问中华人民共和国，是德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国的关系中新的一章的开始。一位德国政府首脑访问中国，在历史上是第一次，访问亚洲国家也是第一次。”
    在谈到中德友好合作条约的时候，博尔茨博士指出，政府代表团的访问中国是在一九五五年九月二十日缔结了莫斯科条约之后进行的。中华人民共和国是同德意志民主共和国缔结这样意义重大的条约的第二个国家。德意志国家和中国在完全平等的基础上缔结一项条约，在历史上也是第一次。
    博尔茨博士详细地阐述了条约的内容，他说，条约序言中说明了条约的目的，是进一步发展和巩固中德两国之间的友好关系和合作，同时两国表示决心为维护和巩固世界和平和安全作出它们的贡献。他指出，“缔约国双方对两国领土的不受侵犯和安全的问题所给予的特别注意，将会对某些西德人士的通过北大西洋公约组织的途径来解决德国问题的想法起着影响。”博尔茨强调指出，站在反对帝国主义斗争最前哨的两个国家的亲密合作，将对保卫欧洲、亚洲和世界和平发生极大的作用。“我们对于同中华人民共和国签订的条约给予特别的评价，并且将尽全力来迅速和彻底地实现它。”
    有记者问到中德友好合作条约对德国恢复统一的意义，博尔茨博士回答说：它加强了整个德国的和平力量，有助于巩固欧洲和平，而欧洲和平就是恢复德国统一的先决条件。他相信中德两国人民的团结，对于外国势力的干涉他国事务是极大的障碍。
    德意志民主共和国驻华大使馆商务参赞杜尔伯在回答关于中德两国贸易的问题时说：中华人民共和国是和德意志民主共和国保持贸易关系最重要的国家之一。自从一九五一年以来，两国已签订了六项贸易协定和三项补充协定。两国贸易额每年都有增长。一九五六年的贸易额将增为一九五一年的百分之三百七十五。中国正越来越多地供给民主德国人民生活和工业所需要的货物和原料，民主德国供给中国以光学精密仪器、工作母机和工厂成套设备。帮助中国建设的民主德国专家在几个月后将增加三倍。两国间在技术科学方面的密切合作，对加速两国的社会主义建设起了很大作用。
    关于中德文化交流，德意志民主共和国外交部部务委员弗里茨·格罗塞大使满意地指出了中德文化交流活动的日益扩大，他说：“二十五日签订的中德文化合作协定，表明了两国之间文化合作的远景。”
    人民议院外交政策委员会主席彼得·弗洛林在招待会上回答了记者们关于德国统一的问题，他指出，德意志民主共和国的建立对于德国恢复统一和和平有着很大的作用。他说，一九四九年以后，在德意志民主共和国已经消灭了军国主义和法西斯主义，因而也消灭了垄断资本家和容克地主的统治。过去反对法西斯主义的力量掌握了政权，第二次世界大战期间同盟国的协议和波茨坦协议的规定已经获得实现。他重申了德意志民主共和国在日内瓦会议时关于德国恢复统一的建议，并说，德意志民主共和国对任何能促进德国统一的建议表示欢迎。
    他又说，德意志民主共和国今后将继续努力促进协商、继续推行和平民主政策，对西德民主力量指出道路，并对它们给予支持。以民主德国作为榜样，西德的民主运动将会高涨，从而有助于扫除恢复德国统一的障碍。
    博尔茨博士在谈到目前国际局势时说，目前在国际事务中，建立集体安全体系和消灭殖民主义两大问题的重大意义是无可争辩的。它们不但必须得到解决，而且一定能够得到解决。
    埃及通讯社记者问到德意志民主共和国政府对待中东国家、特别是对待埃及的政策。博尔茨博士引述中德两国政府联合声明来作为回答，声明说：
  “双方宣布坚决反对任何表现的殖民主义，它们支持一切为争取民族独立和保卫国家主权、领土完整而斗争的国家和人民。它们……支持北非人民为民族自决而进行的斗争，支持阿拉伯各国人民的正当要求和它们反对被拖进侵略性军事集团的立场。”博尔茨博士接着说，“这是德国政府支持亚非人民要求民族自决权的第一次声明”。
    博尔茨博士谈到在中国和朝鲜的访问，给他留下了很深的印象。他说他曾同中国、朝鲜的工人、农民、科学家和青年作了广泛的接触，他对人们为建设新生活所进行的劳动表示钦佩。他说，代表团在中国访问了许多地方，看到中国在社会主义建设中不但保持了古老的文化，而且获得了新的生命。
