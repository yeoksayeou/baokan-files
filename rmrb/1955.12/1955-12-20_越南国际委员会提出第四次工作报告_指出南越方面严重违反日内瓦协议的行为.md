Xinhua News Agency, December 20th. Recently, the International Commission for Vietnam submitted its fourth working report. The report narrates the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam from April 11th to August 10th this year and the work of the International Commission.

The report points out that the armies of both sides in Vietnam had completely gathered on both sides of the Demilitarized Zone before May 18th this year. However, further implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam has been severely hampered. The clauses concerning the all-Vietnam election have not been complied with, and the work of the International Commission in South Vietnam has been obstructed and undermined in every possible way.

The report emphasizes that the Ngo Dinh Diem government of South Vietnam has openly declared in recent months that it is not bound by the Geneva Accords and refuses to guarantee the International Commission protection, assistance, and cooperation in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. On July 20th this year, violence against the International Commission even occurred in Saigon. The International Commission believes that the Geneva Accords are the legal basis for the International Commission to carry out its work, and the Ngo Dinh Diem government's opposition to the Geneva Accords "seriously threatens the International Commission's ability to continue its activities and effectively perform its tasks." The report requests the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and all participating countries of the Geneva Accords to consider this issue so that the International Commission can work effectively in Vietnam.

The report also accuses the Ngo Dinh Diem government of persecuting former resistance personnel in its ruling area. The International Commission has sent many groups to investigate such incidents, but the Ngo Dinh Diem government has used various methods to obstruct the investigation work of these groups. Nevertheless, as of August 10th this year, the International Commission had reached conclusions fifteen times, pointing out that the South Vietnamese side had violated the provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning the protection of the people's democratic freedoms and the protection of residents' lives and property. The International Commission pointed out: "The analysis of the investigation results of these incidents shows that 319 cases involved harm to life and 203 cases involved infringement of freedom. On many occasions, the Commission's recommendations were not implemented and corrective measures were not taken." On the other hand, the International Commission also mentioned in the report's annex that it had investigated whether the Vietnamese People's Army had similar violations of the agreement in accordance with the accusations of the South Vietnamese side. The results proved that those accusations were unfounded.

The report mentions the issue of civilian relocation. According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, before May 18th this year, residents in one area of Vietnam could move to another area in accordance with the principle of voluntariness. The International Commission believes that by May 18th this year, the vast majority of people who were willing to relocate had already relocated. However, considering that some people who were willing to relocate might not have had time to relocate before May 18th, the International Commission suggested that both sides extend the deadline for allowing and assisting civilian relocation to July 20th this year. Both sides had expressed their agreement to this suggestion to the International Commission. However, the International Commission's fixed inspection teams stationed in South Vietnam found that many local authorities in South Vietnam had not received instructions to extend the relocation deadline at all. The Saigon branch of the International Commission also pointed out that more than 3,500 people in Saigon who requested to move north had not obtained permission from the Ngo Dinh Diem government. The report finally pointed out that after July 20th this year, there were still a few special circumstances in civilian relocation that needed to be dealt with, but the Ngo Dinh Diem government's opposition to the Geneva Accords hindered the resolution of these remaining issues.

The Canadian representative of the International Commission expressed a separate opinion on the issue of civilian relocation in the report. He tried to portray the situation as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam not having properly implemented the provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning civilian relocation. However, he could not but point out that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had continuously made improvements in implementing the provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning civilian relocation. He also pointed out various facts about the Ngo Dinh Diem government's obstruction of civilian relocation to the north.

In addition, the report also mentioned that the International Commission had discovered the South Vietnamese side's shipment of combat materials, believing that this was not in accordance with the Geneva Accords. The International Commission is also continuing to investigate the South Vietnamese side's shipment of a large number of American military aircraft.

### 越南国际委员会提出第四次工作报告  指出南越方面严重违反日内瓦协议的行为

    越南国际委员会提出第四次工作报告
    指出南越方面严重违反日内瓦协议的行为
    新华社二十日讯　最近，越南国际委员会提出了第四次工作报告。报告叙述了今年四月十一日到八月十日在越南实施日内瓦协议的情况和国际委员会的工作。
    报告指出，越南双方的军队，已经在今年五月十八日以前，完全集结到非军事区的两侧。但是在越南进一步实施日内瓦协议，却遭受到严重的阻挠。有关全越南选举问题的条款并没有被遵守，国际委员会在南越的工作受到了百般的阻挠和破坏。
    报告着重指出，南越吴庭艳政府近几个月来竟然公开声称它不受日内瓦协议的约束，拒绝按照日内瓦协议的规定保证给予国际委员会以保护、协助和合作。今年七月二十日，在西贡还发生了对国际委员会使用暴力的事件。国际委员会认为，日内瓦协议是国际委员会据以进行工作的法律基础，吴庭艳政府反对日内瓦协议的态度使“国际委员会继续进行活动并且有效地执行其任务遭受到严重的威胁”。报告要求日内瓦会议的两位主席和日内瓦协议的所有参加国考虑这个问题，使国际委员会能够在越南有效地工作。
    报告也指责吴庭艳政府在它的统治区内迫害前抗战人员。国际委员会曾经派出了不少小组对这一类事件进行调查，但是，吴庭艳政府却用各种办法对这些小组的调查工作加以阻挠。尽管如此，截至今年八月十日止，国际委员会已经十五次作出结论，指出南越方面违反了日内瓦协议有关保护人民民主自由、保障居民生命财产的规定。国际委员会指出：“对于这些事件调查结果的分析表明，有三百十九起牵涉到生命的伤害，有二百零三起牵涉到侵犯自由。在不少场合并没有执行委员会的建议而采取纠正措施。”在另一方面，国际委员会在报告附件中也提到，它曾经按照南越方面的指控对越南人民军是否有类似的违反协议事件进行了调查。结果证明那些指控毫无根据。
    报告提到平民迁居问题。根据日内瓦协议的规定，在今年五月十八日以前，越南一方地区的居民，可以按照自愿的原则，迁往另一方地区。国际委员会认为，到今年五月十八日，绝大多数愿意迁居的人都已经迁居。但是，考虑到可能有一些愿意迁居的人在五月十八日以前还没有来得及迁居，因此，国际委员会建议双方把准许和协助平民迁居的期限延长到今年七月二十日。双方曾经向国际委员会表示同意这一建议。可是，国际委员会驻南越的各固定视察小组发现，南越许多地方当局根本没有接到延长迁居期限的指示。国际委员会在西贡的分会也指出，在西贡有三千五百多名要求北迁的人并没有得到吴庭艳政府的许可。报告最后指出，从今年七月二十日以后，在平民迁居方面还有少数一些特殊情况需要处理，但是，吴庭艳政府反对日内瓦协议的态度却阻挠了这些剩余问题的解决。
    国际委员会的加拿大代表在报告中曾经就平民迁居问题提出单独的意见。他力图把情况说成是越南民主共和国方面没有很好地执行日内瓦协议中有关平民迁居的规定。可是，他也不能不指出越南民主共和国方面在执行日内瓦协议有关平民迁居的规定方面，曾经不断有所改进。他也指出了吴庭艳政府阻挠平民北迁的各项事实。
    此外，报告还提到，国际委员会曾经发现南越方面运入作战物资的情况，认为这是不符合日内瓦协议的。国际委员会并且正就有关南越方面运入大量美国军用飞机一事，继续进行调查。
