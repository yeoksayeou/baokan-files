The Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute of the Ministry of Health was officially established on December 19th. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class affiliated with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute also held its opening ceremony. This is an important step in strengthening research on Traditional Chinese Medicine. From now on, the work of our country's medical community in learning, organizing, and improving the legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine will be carried out in a unified and organized manner under the guidance of specialized institutions.

Our country's medical heritage is very rich. The fundamental task of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute is to organize well-known Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to collectively study the theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine and provide clinical experience, while also organizing Western medicine doctors to cooperate with Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to learn and study Traditional Chinese medicine and Traditional Chinese medicinal knowledge, collect and organize folk secret recipes and prescriptions, absorb all the reasonable and effective parts of them and improve them, better serve the people's health care cause, and enrich modern medical science.

In the past few years, our country's Traditional Chinese Medicine research work has achieved certain results. Thanks to the efforts of some Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and Western medicine doctors, many good Traditional Chinese medicine experiences have been discovered and affirmed. Some of these experiences surpass the efficacy of modern Western medicine. The achievements of the Shijiazhuang Epidemic Encephalitis B Treatment Group, the Chongqing Hemorrhoids and Fistula Treatment Group, and the Tangshan Qigong Therapy Group are clear examples. The discovery of "Abdominal Dropsy Herb" in Zhejiang for treating schistosomiasis also has important value. At the founding ceremony of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute, the Ministry of Health awarded certificates and bonuses to the Shijiazhuang Epidemic Encephalitis B Treatment Group, the Chongqing Hemorrhoids and Fistula Treatment Group, the Tangshan Qigong Therapy Group, and the contributors of the "Abdominal Dropsy Herb" drug, who have made significant contributions to the study of the legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, commending their achievements and encouraging medical workers to learn from their spirit of conscientiously implementing the policies of the Party and the government and actively studying the legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Due to the past errors of some leaders in the health departments in underestimating the legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Traditional Chinese Medicine research work has not achieved the due results. The research work of a few medical scientists has not been supported by the health departments; some researchers, due to the lack of correct guidance, only conducted research on individual medicines and individual issues. Although they also had some insights, they were not systematic. The cooperation between relevant scientific departments was also very insufficient, which limited the exertion of collective strength and affected the development of research work. After the establishment of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute, under the leadership of the Party and in accordance with the requirements of modern advanced medicine, it should conscientiously correct the shortcomings in the past Traditional Chinese Medicine research work.

Now, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute has initially hired more than 30 well-known Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners from various places to participate in the work. The first phase of its special Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class has absorbed more than 120 graduates from higher medical schools and Western medicine doctors with clinical experience to come to the institute for study and research. Such an organized large-scale study of Traditional Chinese Medicine is the first time in our country's history. The establishment of this Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class has a decisive role in the research work of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute, and the academic performance of the students in the research class will greatly affect the development of Traditional Chinese Medicine research work. Therefore, strengthening the leadership of the teaching work of the research class is the key to carrying out Traditional Chinese Medicine research work. In the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class, Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are the teachers, and Western medicine doctors are the students. The quality of teaching results depends on the attitude of teaching and learning, and more importantly, the attitude of learning. We should constantly carry out policy education patiently among Western medicine students, constantly eliminate ideological obstacles, help them solve difficulties, encourage them to adopt a scientific attitude, study diligently, and accept all the achievements of Traditional Chinese Medicine and organize them with advanced scientific theories. The responsibility of Traditional Chinese medicine teachers is to: summarize their knowledge and experience well, teach them to students without reservation, and work together to promote the legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

In addition to the Acupuncture Research Institute, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute has also established research departments for internal medicine, surgery, Traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, and medical history, which are necessary for comprehensive research on Traditional Chinese Medicine. However, the research work of these departments should be realistic, have priorities, and pay attention to the improvement of new experiences. Experiences such as the treatment of epidemic encephalitis B and the treatment of hemorrhoids and fistulas should be further studied and improved to become theories. This is of great significance for guiding general research work and for strengthening the confidence of researchers and encouraging their enthusiasm. The research topics should first focus on clinical effect experiments to prevent the tendency of aiming too high and being divorced from reality. Research results should be promoted and applied in a timely manner, without having to wait for the summary of a complete set of scientific theories before promoting them.

At present, various epidemics across the country still seriously endanger people's health and industrial and agricultural production. Traditional Chinese Medicine has various treatment methods and effective medicines for epidemics such as malaria, kala-azar, venereal diseases, hookworm disease, and infantile paralysis. Eliminating these epidemics is an urgent task of the health departments. Traditional Chinese Medicine researchers should discover and collect more effective folk therapies and medicines. The achievements of Traditional Chinese Medicine in treating epidemic encephalitis B and the discovery of "Abdominal Dropsy Herb" in treating schistosomiasis are valuable contributions to eliminating these two diseases. If we widely collect and deeply study and promote and apply the experience of Traditional Chinese Medicine in preventing and treating various epidemics, then we will definitely be able to make more contributions to eliminating various epidemics. Therefore, it is necessary to include Traditional Chinese Medicine research work as an important part of the plan to eliminate infectious diseases and carry it out in a planned manner.

Since our country's medical heritage is very rich and Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are widely distributed, the task of sorting out the legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is not enough to rely solely on the strength of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute. We must also mobilize the Traditional Chinese Medicine and Traditional Chinese medicinal herb research departments across the country to conduct research together. At present, most provinces in the country have Traditional Chinese Medicine hospitals, and there are many Traditional Chinese Medicine and Traditional Chinese medicinal herb research organizations. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute should cooperate with them, absorb their experience at any time, and learn from them. Because the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute is responsible for guiding the Traditional Chinese Medicine research work across the country, it should also help the Traditional Chinese Medicine research departments in various places solve difficult problems.

Traditional Chinese Medicine research work is an arduous and creative work. The health administrative leadership departments should conscientiously implement the policy of cooperation between Traditional Chinese and Western medicine, strive to strengthen the unity between Traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and support their work, providing them with convenient conditions for their research work, to ensure the smooth progress of this work.

    加强中医研究工作的重要步骤
    卫生部中医研究院已经在本月十九日宣告成立，中医研究院所属的中医研究班也同时举行了开学典礼。这是加强中医研究工作的重要步骤。今后我国医学界学习、整理和提高祖国医学遗产的工作，将会在专门机构的统一指导下有组织地进行。
    我国的医学遗产十分丰富。组织著名的中医集体钻研中医的学理和提供临床经验，同时组织西医同中医合作，从事中医中药知识的学习和研究，搜集和整理民间的秘方、单方，吸收其中一切合理的有效用的部分并加以提高，更好地为人民保健事业服务，丰富现代的医学科学，这是中医研究院的根本任务。
    几年来，我国的中医研究工作已经取得一定的成绩。由于一部分中医和西医的努力，发现和肯定了许多良好的中医经验。这些经验，有些是超越了现代西医的疗效的。石家庄市流行性乙型脑炎治疗小组、重庆市痔瘘医疗小组、唐山市气功疗法小组的成就，就是显明的例证。浙江治疗血吸虫病的“腹水草”的发现，也有重要的价值。在中医研究院成立典礼大会上，卫生部对于研究祖国医学遗产有重大贡献的石家庄市流行性乙型脑炎治疗小组、重庆市痔瘘医疗小组、唐山市气功疗法小组以及“腹水草”药物的贡献者，颁发了奖状、奖金，表扬他们的功绩，并且鼓励医药工作者学习他们认真执行党和政府的政策、积极研究祖国医学遗产的精神。
    由于过去卫生部门的某些领导人员有轻视祖国医学遗产的错误，中医研究工作还没有取得应有的成绩。少数医学家的研究工作没有得到卫生部门的支持；有些研究工作者因为没有正确的指导，只作了一些单位药的研究和个别问题的探讨，虽然也有些心得，但不是系统的。而有关科学部门之间的合作也十分不够，限制了集体力量的发挥，影响了研究工作的发展。中医研究院成立以后，应该在党的领导下，按照现代先进医学的要求，切实纠正以往中医研究工作中的缺点。
    现在，中医研究院第一批聘请了各地著名中医三十多名参加工作，它特设的中医研究班第一期吸收了高等医药学校毕业生和具有临床经验的西医师一百二十多名，来院进行学习和研究。这样有组织地大规模地学习中医，在我国历史上还是第一次。这个中医研究班的设立，对于中医研究院的研究工作有着决定性的作用，研究班学员的学习成绩将极大地影响中医研究工作的发展。因此，加强研究班教学工作的领导，是开展中医研究工作的关键。在中医研究班里面，中医是老师，西医是学生。教学成绩的好坏，决定于教与学的态度，更重要的是学的态度。应该不断地在西医学员当中耐心地进行政策教育，随时扫除思想障碍，帮助他们解决困难，鼓励他们采取科学的态度，刻苦钻研，把中医成就全部接受过来，用先进的科学理论加以整理。中医老师的责任是：很好地总结自己的学识和经验，无保留地教给学生，共同为发扬祖国医学遗产而努力。
    中医研究院除了针灸研究所以外，还设立了内科、外科以及中药和医史等研究部门，这是全面研究中医所必需的。但是，关于这些部门的研究工作，应该实事求是，要有重点，要注意新经验的提高工作。像治疗流行性乙型脑炎的经验，治疗痔瘘的经验，应该进一步加以研究，使它们提高成为理论。这对于指导一般的研究工作有很大的意义，对于坚定研究人员的信心、鼓励他们的积极性也有很大的作用。研究的课题应该首先着重临床效果的实验，防止好高鹜远、脱离实际的偏向。研究成果应该及时推广应用，不必等待总结出成套的科学理论然后才去推广。
    目前，全国各地的各种流行病，对于人民健康和工、农业生产的危害还是很严重的。而中医对流行病，如疟疾、黑热病、性病、钩虫病、小儿麻痹症等，都有各种治疗方法和有效药物。消灭这些流行病，是卫生部门的迫切任务。中医研究工作人员应该更多地发见和收集有效的民间疗法和药物。中医治疗流行性乙型脑炎的成绩，“腹水草”治血吸虫病的发现，对于消灭这两种疾病是宝贵的贡献。假如对中医各种防治流行病的经验，进行广泛收集和深入研究，推广应用，那末，对消灭各种流行病就
  一定能够作出更多的贡献。因此，有必要把中医研究工作列为消灭传染病规划中的一项重要内容，有计划地去进行。
    由于我国医学遗产十分丰富，中医散布的地区十分广阔，整理祖国医学遗产的任务，仅仅靠中医研究院的力量是不够的，还必须发动全国各地中医中药研究部门共同进行研究。目前全国各省大都设有中医院，并且有不少中医中药的研究组织。中医研究院应该同他们合作，随时吸取他们的经验，向他们学习。中医研究院因为对全国的中医研究工作负有指导责任，还应该帮助各地的中医研究部门解决疑难问题。
    中医研究工作是一项艰苦的富有创造性的工作。卫生行政领导部门应该切实贯彻执行中西医合作的方针，努力加强中西医之间的团结，并且支持他们的工作，给他们的研究工作提供便利条件，以保证这项工作的顺利进行。
