The call of "one educated youth eliminating one illiterate" recently reached Bengu Village, Lingui County, Guangxi Province. Yang Shulan, a member of the agricultural production cooperative in the village, immediately volunteered to teach two young people to read. She also actively mobilized educated youth in the village to participate in literacy work.

Yang Shulan is a member of the Communist Youth League and a mother of four children. She is currently studying in the village's elementary school and has already learned more than two thousand characters. She has read more than half of the four hundred books in the township library. This is the result of her five years of persistent study in the people's school.

Yang Shulan was born into a poor peasant family. Famine once forced her family to sell her as a servant to a bureaucrat-landlord's family. When she turned sixteen, the landlord married her off to a farmer in Bengu Village. After liberation, Yang Shulan actively participated in various social activities. Once, when she went to promote maternal and child health knowledge to the masses, she remembered it firmly when listening to others, but when she entered the door of the masses' homes, she forgot most of it, and after saying two or three sentences, she had to retreat with a red face. A series of similar things happened afterward. Yang Shulan deeply felt the pain of not being able to read.

In 1950, Bengu Village opened a people's school, and Yang Shulan quickly signed up for enrollment. Some people saw that she was pregnant and still holding a two-year-old child and said, "You can't just be a figurehead!" Her husband and mother-in-law were also afraid that she would affect production and not take good care of the children. Yang Shulan had her own plans. At night, she tidied up the housework, coaxed the children to sleep, and then recognized characters in front of the oil lamp. She carried books with her when she went to the mountains to chop firewood and worked in the fields, and immediately wrote down the names of things she saw. When cooking in the kitchen, she also drew characters on the ground with firewood. During her maternity leave, she studied at home and sometimes asked classmates to teach her. Gradually, she was able to go to the library to read books. Only then did she discover so many "treasures" in the books. After reading "The Story of Zoya and Shura," she began to pay attention to the education of her children. She also improved her relationship with her mother-in-law, who took the initiative to help her take care of the children, and she took the time to read newspapers to the co-op members. This year, she also introduced to everyone the advanced farming methods and fertilization methods mentioned in the newspaper.

Now, Yang Shulan's eldest child is already seven years old and attends school like her mother.

    四个孩子的妈妈也能学好文化
    最近，“一个知识青年扫除一个文盲”的号召，传到广西省临桂县本固村。村里的农业生产合作社社员阳书兰立即表示要包教两个青年认字。她还积极动员村里知识青年参加扫盲工作。
    阳书兰是青年团员，还是四个孩子的妈妈。她现在在村里民校高小读书，已经认识二千多字。她把乡图书馆的四百多本书读完了一大半。这是她五年来在民校坚持不懈地学习所取得的成绩。
    阳书兰出身在一个贫农的家庭。灾荒曾逼着她的家庭把她卖给官僚地主家当丫头。她熬到十六岁，地主把她嫁给本固村的一个农民。解放以后，阳书兰积极参加各种社会活动。有一次，她去向群众宣传妇幼卫生常识，阳书兰在听别人讲的时候，还记得牢牢的，一进到群众家里的门口，就忘了一大半，说不上两、三句，只好红着脸退出来。以后也发生过一连串同样的事情。阳书兰深深感觉到不认识字的苦处。
    一九五零年，本固村开办民校，阳书兰连忙去报名入学。有人看见她怀着孕，手里还抱个两岁的孩子，就说：“可不能光挂个名！”丈夫和婆婆也怕她影响生产和带不好孩子。阳书兰可有自己的打算。晚上，她整理好家务，哄孩子睡了，就在油灯前认字。她上山砍柴，下地干活都带着书本，见到一样东西就立刻默写这东西的名称。在灶间烧火的时候，也用木柴在地上划字。在生孩子休息的日子里，就在家里自学，有时候请同学来教她。渐渐地她能进图书馆去看书了。这才使她发现了书中有那么多的“宝贝”。她读了“卓娅和舒拉的故事”，开始注意对孩子的教育。她还改善了同婆婆的关系，婆婆便主动地帮她照料孩子，她抽工夫给社员们读报。今年她还把报上讲的先进耕作方法、施肥方法介绍给大家。
    现在，阳书兰的大孩子已经七岁了，同妈妈一样上了学校。
