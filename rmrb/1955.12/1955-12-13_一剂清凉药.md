A Dose of Cooling Medicine

Recently, in order to safeguard its national security, the Soviet Union conducted a hydrogen bomb test. According to the Soviet Union, this was the most powerful explosion ever conducted at high altitude. This test has served as a dose of cooling medicine to those hotheads in the United States who are obsessed with launching a hydrogen bomb war. This is evidenced by the reactions of some representative organs and figures of the American bourgeoisie.

Those American bourgeois newspapers that have always brandished atomic weapons with teeth and claws now sadly conclude that the so-called "atomic superiority" of the United States does not exist after all. The "New York Times" stated that the Soviet Union's achievements in manufacturing thermonuclear weapons and the means of transporting such weapons "have created a new situation" that requires the United States "to avoid underestimating Soviet strength and refusing to consider the dangers of Moscow's military achievements." The "New York Herald Tribune" also said, "If anyone ever had any tendency to underestimate the Soviet Union's achievements in this area, then that tendency no longer exists."

The so-called "atomic diplomacy" that relies on atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons for blackmail is now like a deflated bladder. The "Christian Science Monitor" stated: "Washington is no longer standing on the mountain of atomic superiority to speak to the Soviet bloc." It also said that Washington "dares not express that it might be prepared to use such weapons as a diplomatic tool"; in future dealings with the Soviet Union, "the tools must be non-atomic."

The Soviet hydrogen bomb explosion has somewhat sobered the minds of those American politicians who have always regarded atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons as the foundation of American foreign policy. Retired Lieutenant General Groves, who directed the creation of the first American atomic bomb, said: "This fact (referring to the Soviet hydrogen bomb test) – I repeat – only emphasizes this very important fact: we cannot fight another war." Former US President Truman, who ordered the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Japan and formulated the post-war American "Cold War" policy, also expressed his desire to "pray for world peace," saying, "We cannot afford another world war in this century." Of course, when Truman said these words, he was not thinking of banning atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, but these words nevertheless reflect that American politicians cannot but take into account the cold reality.

When announcing the hydrogen bomb test, the Soviet Union stated that it would continue to strive for the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. However, the warmongers and "power politics" advocates in the United States are clearly unwilling to give up this bankrupt "atomic blackmail" weapon. For example, US Air Force Secretary Quarles is still clamoring that the United States should have "the most powerful striking force in the world." The Washington "Star" also shouted: "The United States – in close coordination with its allies – must do everything possible to ensure that it does not lag behind or come in second in the nuclear and thermonuclear race."

However, these cries also illustrate that the proponents of "American atomic superiority" are alarmed and uneasy about losing this "advantage." (Tian)

    一剂清凉药
    最近，苏联为了保障国家的安全，试验了一次氢弹爆炸。据苏联宣布，这是在高空进行的直到现在为止曾经进行过的爆炸中最猛烈的一次。这次试验对于美国那些醉心于发动一次氢弹战争的热昏者起了一剂清凉药的作用。从美国资产阶级的一些有代表性的言论机关和人物的反应中，可以得到证明。
    美国那些一向张牙舞爪地挥舞原子武器的资产阶级报刊现在悲哀地得出结论：美国所谓的“原子优势”原来并不存在。“纽约时报”就说，苏联在制造热核子武器和载运这种武器的工具方面取得的成就，“已经造成一种新的局势”，使得美国“必须避免低估苏联力量和拒绝考虑莫斯科军事成就的危险”。“纽约先驱论坛报”也说，“如果有人曾经怀有任何小看苏联在这方面的成就的倾向的话，那末，现在，这种倾向早就不存在了。”
    凭借原子武器和氢武器进行讹诈的所谓“原子外交”现在像一个瘪了气的皮囊。“基督教科学箴言报”就说：“华盛顿已经不再站在原子优势的高山上向苏联集团讲话了。”它还说，华盛顿“不敢再表示它可能准备用这种武器作为一种外交工具”；今后同苏联打交道，“其工具必须是非原子性的”。
    苏联氢弹的爆炸使得那些一向把原子武器和氢武器作为美国外交政策的基础的美国政客们的头脑多少清醒了一些。指导制造美国第一枚原子弹、已经退休的格罗夫斯中将说：“这一事实（指苏联试验氢弹）——我再重复一遍——只是强调说明了这个非常重要的事实：我们不能再进行另一次战争了。”下令在日本投掷第一枚原子弹、订下战后美国“冷战”政策的前任美国总统杜鲁门，也表示要“祷告全世界和平”，他说，“我们在这个世纪再经不起另一次世界大战了。”当然，杜鲁门在说这些话的时候想到的并不是禁止原子武器和氢武器，但是这些话毕竟反映了美国政客们已经不能不考虑到冷酷的现实了。
    苏联在宣布试验氢弹爆炸的时候表示，它仍然将为禁止原子武器和氢武器而努力。但是美国的好战分子们和“实力政策”鼓吹者显然还不肯放弃这个破产了的“原子讹诈”武器。例如，美国空军部长卡利斯还在吵嚷说美国应该拥有“世界上最强大的打击力量”。华盛顿“明星报”也叫道：“美国——同它的盟国协同一致——必须尽一切力量保证它不会在核子和热核子竞赛中落后或者居第二位。”
    但是，这些叫嚷同时也说明了：“美国原子优势”论者因为失去这个“优势”而惊惶不安了。（田）
