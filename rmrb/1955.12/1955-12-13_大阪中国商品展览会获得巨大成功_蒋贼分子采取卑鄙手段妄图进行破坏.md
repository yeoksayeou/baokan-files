Xinhua News Agency, Osaka Dispatch: In the past eleven days, 929,000 people have visited the Chinese Commodity Exhibition held in Osaka. On December 11th alone, the number of visitors reached over 160,000.

Seeing the great success achieved by the exhibition, members of the Chiang Kai-shek group in Japan have exhausted all means to sabotage it. On December 1st, they used airplanes to scatter leaflets over the exhibition hall, inciting the people of Osaka to oppose the People's Republic of China. However, the broad masses dismissed these leaflets with a smile. After discovering that disseminating defamatory leaflets had failed to deceive the public, the Chiang Kai-shek clique adopted another despicable tactic. They impersonated the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the Japanese Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade, and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade to distribute leaflets. The leaflets included "discount coupons" stating that holders could dine for free in the exhibition hall. These leaflets were airdropped over Osaka on December 3rd. They attempted to create chaos and disrupt the continued exhibition through this shameless means. However, people were not fooled, and the exhibition proceeded smoothly as usual. The next day (Sunday), over 210,000 people visited the exhibition.

This trick has aroused widespread indignation among the Japanese public. The Osaka Chinese Commodity Exhibition Organizing Committee has formally requested the Osaka Prefecture authorities to take action on this matter. The Foreign Affairs Division Chief of the Osaka Prefectural Police Headquarters said, "This is a criminal act," and the Police Headquarters is pursuing the perpetrators.

The Chinese Commodity Exhibition in Osaka also attracts many overseas Chinese from Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, and other cities in western Japan every day. They say: This exhibition of our motherland brings glory to us overseas Chinese. Some say: In the past, we only saw foreign-made machines. Now, for the first time in our lives, when we see machines made by our motherland, we are moved to tears. The rapid development of China has enabled us to stand tall.

Hundreds of visiting groups composed of parliamentarians, business people, students, workers, and farmers have come from all over western Japan to visit. The visiting group from Beppu City also brought handicrafts, bamboo baskets, landscape picture albums, and other gifts presented to Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai by the Mayor and Chairman of the City Council of Beppu.

More than 600 trading companies and manufacturing companies in western Japan have sent representatives to discuss the possibility of trading with China. The owner of a shipbuilding company in Hiroshima Prefecture said that one-third of the shipyards there are closed. He hopes to lift the "embargo" so that he can sell ships to China.

So far, 200,000 people have watched Chinese films in the cinema next to the exhibition hall. Teachers and students especially praised the film "Flowers of the Motherland." One teacher suggested: "This healthy and happy film should be shown to all Japanese children."

    大阪中国商品展览会获得巨大成功
    蒋贼分子采取卑鄙手段妄图进行破坏
    据新华社大阪电　在过去十一天当中已经有九十二万九千人参观了在大阪举行的中国商品展览会。十二月十一日一天内，参观的人数有十六万多人。
    看到展览会获得的巨大成功，在日本的蒋介石集团分子用尽一切办法来破坏它。十二月一日，他们用飞机在展览馆所在地上空散发传单，煽动大阪人民反对中华人民共和国。但是广大群众对这些传单一笑置之。在发现散发诽谤性的传单没有能欺骗公众以后，蒋贼分子采取了另一种卑鄙手段，他们冒用日本国际贸易促进协会、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟和中国国际贸易促进委员会的名义来散发传单，传单上附有“优待券”，上面说，持有优待券者可以免费在展览馆大厅里用餐。这些传单是十二月三日在大阪上空空投的。他们企图用这种无耻的手段来制造混乱，破坏展览会的继续展出。但是，人们没有上当，展览会照常顺利进行。在第二天（星期日）有二十一万多人去展览会参观。
    这个伎俩引起了广泛的日本公众的愤慨。大阪中国商品展览会实施委员会已经正式要求大阪府当局就这件事采取行动。大阪府警察本部的外事科长说：“这是犯罪行为”，警察本部正在追缉罪犯。
    大阪的中国商品展览会也每天吸引着大阪、京都和神户以及日本西部的其他城市中的许多华侨。他们说：我们祖国的这次展览会为我们华侨带来了光荣。有些人说：过去，我们只看见外国制造的机器。现在我们在有生以来第一次看到我们祖国制造的机器的时候，我们感动得流泪了。中国的迅速发展已经使我们能够挺起胸膛来了。
    由议会议员、企业界人士、学生、工人和农民组成的数以百计的参观团从日本西部各地赶来参观。从别府市来的参观团还带来了别府市长和市议会议长赠送给毛泽东主席和周恩来总理的手工艺品竹篮、风景图册和其他礼品。
    日本西部各地有六百多家贸易公司和制造公司已经派遣代表来商谈了同中国进行贸易的可能性。广岛县的一家造船公司的主人说，那里的造船厂有三分之一都关闭了。他希望取消“禁运”，以便能够把船只卖给中国。
    到现在为止，已经有二十万人在展览馆旁边设的电影馆里观看了中国电影。教员们和学生们特别称赞影片“祖国的花朵”。有一个教员建议说：“这个健康的、幸福的影片，应当向全体日本儿童放映”。
