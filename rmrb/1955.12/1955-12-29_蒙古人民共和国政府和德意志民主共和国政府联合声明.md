Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, December 28th: The joint statement of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Government of the German Democratic Republic was signed in Ulan Bator at 7:30 PM on December 27th.

The joint statement was signed by: Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, and Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic.

The full text of the joint statement is as follows:

At the invitation of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic, a delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, paid a friendly visit to the Mongolian People's Republic from December 26 to December 28, 1955. The members of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic were:

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Lothar Bolz;

State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, Dr. Heinrich Toeplitz;

Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee of the People's Chamber, Peter Florin;

Head of Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Fritz Große;

Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to the Mongolian People's Republic, Johannes König;

Secretary of the Presidium of the Free German Trade Union Federation, Christa Jablonowski;

President of Humboldt University of Berlin, Professor Neye;

Major General of the Barracked People's Police, Heinrich Dorlweitzer;

Director of the "Friendship" Agricultural Production Cooperative and Hero of Labor, Ernst Wulf;

Technician and activist of the state-owned Dessau Wagon Factory, Werner Hohn.

Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, and Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, exchanged views. The Mongolian side present at the exchange of views included: D. Damba, member of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural, Deputy Prime Ministers S. Luvsan, Tsende, and Avarzed, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Luvsandan, Deputy Minister Yadamjav, and Head of Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Banzar. The German side present included: all members of the delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic. The discussion covered issues related to further developing and consolidating the existing friendly relations between the two countries, as well as issues related to the interests of both countries.

The exchange of views took place in a friendly and sincere atmosphere.

Both sides affirmed their complete agreement on issues of common interest and agreed to further develop and consolidate the friendly relations that already exist between the two countries, especially economic and cultural relations.

At the same time, the great significance of cooperation with countries that have the most friendly relations with the Mongolian People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic was emphasized.

Both sides noted with satisfaction the affirmation of the famous Five Principles:

	Mutual respect for territorial sovereignty;
	Mutual non-aggression;
	Mutual non-interference in internal affairs;
	Equality and mutual benefit;
	Peaceful coexistence.

Both sides are convinced that relations between countries can be developed on the basis of the above principles, and that the application of these principles in international relations can promote mutual understanding and ease international tensions.

Therefore, both sides declare their willingness to maintain normal relations with any country, regardless of its social system, on this basis.

The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Mongolian People's Republic and the Republic of India is a new proof that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have been invoked and developed, and is an event of great international significance in consolidating the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Peace in Europe and Asia is indivisible. The current policy of certain aggressive groups in the United States of establishing aggressive military blocs, especially the restoration of West German militarism, threatens peace.

The most necessary prerequisite for the peaceful and democratic unification of Germany is the establishment of a European collective security system, the dissolution of military blocs, and the abolition of the rule of monopoly capitalists and Junker landlords in West Germany. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic expresses its complete solidarity with the German people who are fighting for a peaceful and democratic unified Germany.

Both sides believe that the refusal of the Mongolian People's Republic to join the United Nations is a violation of the principles and charter of the United Nations.

The Governments of the Mongolian People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic resolutely condemn the Chiang Kai-shek puppet clique supported by the United States for obstructing the United Nations General Assembly from adopting the recommendation to admit the Mongolian People's Republic. The Mongolian People's Republic is a peace-loving sovereign state and should become a member state of the United Nations. The United Nations can only fulfill its tasks when its principle of universality is strictly observed and countries that meet the requirements of the Charter are admitted as member states. Both sides welcome the admission of sixteen countries to the United Nations as a result of the Soviet Union's initiative.

The Governments of the Mongolian People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic declare their determination to continue to fight for the maintenance of world peace and the strengthening of friendly cooperation between the peoples of all countries in the future.

    蒙古人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府联合声明
    新华社乌兰巴托二十八日电　蒙古人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府联合声明十二月二十七日下午七时三十分在乌兰巴托签字。
    在联合声明上签字的是：蒙古人民共和国总理泽登巴尔和德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥。
    联合声明全文如下：
    以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应蒙古人民共和国政府的邀请，于一九五五年十二月二十六日至十二月二十八日在蒙古人民共和国进行了友好访问。德意志民主共和国代表团的团员如下：
    副总理兼外交部长洛塔·博尔茨博士；
    司法部国务秘书海因里希·特普利茨博士；
    人民议院外交政策委员会主席彼得·弗洛林；
    外交部部务委员弗里茨·格罗塞大使；
    德意志民主共和国驻蒙古人民共和国大使约翰尼斯·柯尼希；
    自由德国工会联合会理事会书记处书记克丽斯塔·雅布朗斯基；
    柏林洪堡大学校长奈耶博士教授；
    驻营人民警察将军海因里希·多尔维策尔；
    “友谊”农业生产合作社主任劳动英雄恩斯特·乌尔夫；
    国营德绍车厢制造厂技师、积极分子韦尔纳·霍恩。
    蒙古人民共和国总理尤·泽登巴尔和德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥交换了意见。交换意见时，蒙古方面出席的有：大人民呼拉尔主席团委员达·达姆巴，副总理锡林迪布、鲁布桑、曾德、阿维尔齐德，外交部代理部长拉布丹、副部长雅丹甲夫，外交部部务委员班扎尔，德国方面出席的有：德意志民主共和国政府代表团全体团员。讨论了进一步发展和巩固两国间现已存在的友好关系问题以及同两国利益有关的问题。
    交换意见是在友好和诚挚的气氛中进行的。
    双方确认对共同利益有关的问题的意见完全一致，并且同意进一步发展和巩固已经存在于两国之间的友好关系尤其是经济和文化关系。
    同时强调同蒙古人民共和国和德意志民主共和国有最友好关系的国家的合作的重大意义。
    双方满意地确认著名的五项原则：
    互相尊重领土主权；
    互不侵犯；
    互不干涉内政；
    平等互利；
    和平共处。
    双方确信，各国之间的关系能在上述原则的基础上获得发展，在国际关系中应用这些原则能增进相互了解和缓和国际紧张局势。
    因此，双方声明愿意在此基础上同任何国家、不论其社会制度如何，维持正常关系。
    蒙古人民共和国和印度共和国建立外交关系是和平共处的五项原则得到援用和发展的新的证明，是巩固亚洲和世界和平事业中一个具有重大国际意义的事件。
    欧洲和亚洲的和平不可分割。目前美国的某些侵略集团建立着侵略性的军事集团，特别是恢复着西德的军国主义，他们的这种政策威胁着和平。
    德国的和平民主统一的最必需的先决条件是建立欧洲的集体安全体系、解散军事集团、废除垄断资本家和容克地主在西德的统治。蒙古人民共和国政府表示同为争取和平民主统一德国而斗争的德意志人民完全团结一致。
    双方认为拒绝蒙古人民共和国加入联合国是违反联合国原则和宪章的行为。
    蒙古人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府坚决谴责美国支持的蒋介石傀儡集团竟阻挠了联合国大会通过接纳蒙古人民共和国的建议。蒙古人民共和国是爱好和平的主权国家，它应该成为联合国会员国。联合国只有在它的普遍性原则被严格遵守、符合宪章规定的国家都被接纳为会员国的时候，才能完成自己的任务。双方欢迎由于苏联的倡议而使十六个国家加入联合国。
    蒙古人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府声明决心在今后继续为维护世界和平、加强各国人民之间的友好合作而斗争。一九五五年十二月二十七日于乌兰巴托
  蒙古人民共和国总理尤·泽登巴尔
  德意志民主共和国总理奥·格罗提渥
