Strive to Comprehensively Fulfill This Year's Construction and Installation Tasks
Deputy Director of the Production Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, Du Enxun

The year 1955 is coming to an end. The time from now until the end of the year is very valuable for the construction and installation of projects. Construction workers and engineering technicians should make persistent efforts, seize the opportunity, and work a hundred times harder to strive for the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of this year's construction and installation tasks.

In the past eleven months, the construction and installation enterprises under the Ministry of Construction Engineering, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and with the active cooperation and support of relevant departments, have achieved great success in realizing the national plan. As of the end of October, a cumulative 84.85 percent of the annual planned workload had been completed. Thirty-three key projects, including the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Tractor Manufacturing Plant, which continued construction and started construction this year, had completed 88.65 percent of their annual plans as of the end of October. Among them, 37 major unit engineering projects had completed more than 90 percent of their annual plans by the end of October. Eight unit engineering projects have been completed and put into production.

After the central government issued instructions on practicing overall economy in June, the Ministry of Construction Engineering and its affiliated enterprises actively took measures from all aspects to practice overall economy and overcome all waste. Generally, all enterprises strengthened the leadership of production organization and universally carried out labor competitions. A new atmosphere of saving and accumulating for the country's socialist construction began to be established on many construction sites.

Through revising the annual plan and compiling the fourth quarter plan, each enterprise made comprehensive arrangements for the specific steps to complete this year's planned tasks, and re-balanced materials, machinery, and labor. Each construction site seized the preparation and implementation of monthly and ten-day comprehensive operation plans and construction operation designs, strengthened the production meeting system and scheduling work, and leading staff went deep into the site, so they could discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Most units reversed the situation of slow progress, quality fluctuations, and the inability to complete monthly plans, and gradually eliminated the phenomenon of uneven construction. As a result, the amount of work completed each month gradually increased. The amount of work completed by the ministry's enterprises from July to October exceeded that of the first half of the year by more than 10 percent, of which key projects exceeded 32 percent.

In the second half of the year, most enterprises strengthened the leadership of technical work and organized major quality and safety inspections. The phenomenon of technical personnel not going to the site and "not doing their job" has been greatly reduced, and the technical quality responsibility system and quality inspection and supervision work have been gradually strengthened. Quality accidents, especially major quality accidents, have been greatly reduced since September.

Many units have implemented some practical and feasible advanced systems and technologies. For example, each engineering office of the enterprises under the Northeast Engineering Management Bureau successively established economic activity analysis committees to conduct monthly economic activity analysis. Each engineering office under the Central South Engineering Management Bureau also gradually carried out economic activity analysis in the third quarter, and based on the analysis results, took effective measures, so from August, the bureau significantly improved labor productivity and eliminated the phenomenon of wage overspending. Many construction sites promoted class and group economic accounting. Although there are still some problems in the work due to lack of experience, all construction sites that have implemented class and group economic accounting have shown a new atmosphere. The most important thing is that the majority of workers are more concerned about the results of their labor. For example, at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant construction site, due to the universal implementation of class and group economic accounting and the corresponding trial implementation of the grassroots reward system, many workers tried to improve work efficiency, improve quality, and pay attention to safety, and used spare time to pick up old, waste, and residual materials, which not only improved labor productivity, reduced non-production labor, and solved the problem of wage overspending, but also saved the country more than 70,000 yuan.

Many units have taken measures to save materials and handle accumulated materials. For example, they strengthened the planning of supply, implemented quota control of materials, and improved procurement and transportation, thereby reducing material costs. The Baotou General Company originally planned to use fine sand from other places, but now uses local fine sand, which can save 12.85 yuan per cubic meter.

Some units promoted advanced technical measures in the construction process. For example, by the end of September, the North China Directly Subordinate Engineering Company had promoted interior scaffolding on 68 percent of the projects where it was feasible, reducing the cost of each square meter of the project by one yuan. Due to the centralized mixing of mortar and strict control of cement grades, the Baotou General Company saved more than 40 tons of cement and about 115 tons of lime in July and August alone. The Datong General Company saved more than 60,000 yuan by using lime emulsion paint and using broken short materials to make shaped templates and other advanced measures in the gymnasium and other four construction sites. Some construction sites also promoted steel reinforced lightweight concrete and the five-course header and one-course stretcher and three-course header and one-course stretcher bricklaying methods and original slurry pointing method in masonry engineering, and adopted advanced technologies such as cold drawing and cold pressing of steel bars in steel structures.

The grassroots production organization and labor organization have also been greatly improved. Some construction sites promoted mixed work teams. The Luoyang Engineering Bureau simplified the organizational hierarchy below the work area, abolished the work section, and the work area directly led the foremen, which was convenient for in-depth mastery of production. Some construction sites promoted parallel flow operation and rapid construction methods. Some construction sites implemented two-shift operations without increasing the number of workers.

All enterprises universally implemented the 1955 labor quota and further promoted the piece-rate wage system. As of the end of September, the total average piece-rate wage coverage of construction and installation projects had reached 60 percent, of which the units under the Northeast Engineering Management Bureau averaged more than 90 percent, and the units under the North China Engineering Management Bureau averaged more than 88 percent. In August and September, the Northeast averaged 105.97 percent completion of the new labor quota; the Datong General Company in North China averaged 112.65 percent completion in the third quarter.

In terms of labor use, the planning control was further strengthened, which not only eliminated the large-scale blind recruitment of temporary workers in the construction upsurge of the past two years, reduced the chaotic situation of rush work, and improved labor productivity to some extent. From July to November, the average daily output value increased by 16.34 percent compared with the first half of the year, and the actual number of man-days per 1,000 yuan of workload was reduced by seven man-days compared with the same period last year. As of the end of October, a total of more than 3.23 million man-days were saved.

Due to the development of the economy campaign and the improvement of enterprise management, the cost of engineering in the second half of the year was greatly reduced. The amount of cost reduction completed by the Central South Engineering Management Bureau from July to October was more than 387 percent of that in the first half of the year, and the North China, Southwest, Northeast, and other engineering management bureaus were also between 142 and 198 percent.

All of this has laid a good material foundation for the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of the 1955 construction and installation engineering tasks. However, in terms of overall work, there are still some weak links and serious shortcomings.

The most prominent shortcoming in this year's construction is the serious quality accidents and safety accidents. As of the end of September, a total of 3,590 quality accidents of various sizes occurred, causing economic losses of 240,000 yuan. Although the situation has improved in the past month or two, serious accidents still occur on a few construction sites. In a substation project of a certain power station, 38 concrete column foundations did not meet the design requirements. In the exhibition hall project of Taiyuan Industrial School, 15 of the 20 concrete beams poured were scrapped. A foreman of the Third Engineering Office of the First Company in the Northeast mixed 11 baskets of bricks into the concrete, resulting in the collapse of nine rows of roof trusses by the wind. The reasons for these serious accidents are mainly that some leading staff and technical personnel have a one-sided view of "emphasizing speed and neglecting quality" and a thought of arrogance, complacency, and carelessness, and have not earnestly implemented the country's technical policies and regulations. Some major accidents were not dealt with seriously and promptly, and even a few people took a tolerant and concealing attitude, which fostered the occurrence of irresponsible phenomena and gave bad elements an opportunity to take advantage of.

The safety technology and labor protection work of many units have been improved to a certain extent. The frequency of injuries and deaths has decreased by about 50 percent compared with last year, the frequency of serious injuries has also decreased by 26.03 percent, and the disease rate has also decreased. However, the backward state of this work is still unsatisfactory, and the number of deaths has increased compared with last year. Especially since entering the winter, some enterprises have had accidents of workers' sheds being blown down by the wind, gas poisoning, and falling from heights, resulting in casualties and poisoning. The main reason for this phenomenon is that some leading staff do not pay attention to safety technology and labor protection work, and are not concerned enough about improving workers' work safety and labor conditions. When the construction task is tight, they often only focus on speeding up the progress, but do not actively create conditions for the safe production of employees, and even abandon the leadership and inspection of safety technology work. Some major casualties accidents were not dealt with seriously and promptly, in order to learn lessons, educate cadres and employees, and improve work.

It should be pointed out that the construction tasks in some areas are still very tight in the future. In the Northwest region and the Luoyang region, more than 28 percent of the tasks must be completed in November and December. From the perspective of each enterprise, as of the end of October, a few units have only completed 43 to 60 percent of the annual plan, and some key engineering projects have only completed about 40 percent. The labor productivity plan and cost reduction plan of some enterprises have not been completed well, and the phenomenon of overspending on basic wages, machinery use fees, and management expenses is still very serious. For example, as of the end of September, the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau had overspent 13.5 percent on the wage fund, 140 percent on machinery use fees, and 14.5 percent on administrative management fees. The daily output value of the bureau's companies in October only reached 89.9 percent of the daily output value of the annual plan. The main reasons for this situation are poor construction organization and uneven production. The Northwest Engineering Management Bureau's tasks have increased and decreased sharply several times this year, coupled with weak planning management work, resulting in serious idle work and rush work phenomena, and great waste. Secondly, the labor organization is not good, the allocation is unreasonable, there is a lack of strict planning control, there are many over-planned and non-production workers, and the man-hours are greatly wasted. For example, although the Datong General Company over-fulfilled the plan by 4 percent in the third quarter, it used 39 percent more man-hours and overspent 45 percent on wages. In a certain construction site, due to inaccurate planning and poor organization in mechanized construction, the expenditure on machinery downtime accounted for 88 percent of the machinery use fee. Again, some construction sites did not pay close attention to the finishing work, the operation plans were not prepared accurately, timely, and comprehensively, and there were constant disconnections in the supply of labor, machinery, and materials, and the coordination between civil engineering, installation, and subsidiary enterprises, which also hindered the normal progress of the work.

In order to better realize the 1955 plan, all enterprises must seize the winter construction and project finishing work. This year's winter construction of industrial plant projects accounts for a large proportion. Generally, most of the projects are also projects that create conditions for next year's construction, and the plans for these projects must also be completed before the end of the year or during the winter construction period. In particular, the tasks in Xi'an, Luoyang, Lanzhou, Taiyuan and other regions are very heavy, and the amount of finishing work is very large. Now, some projects have been delayed repeatedly due to lack of attention to seize. If effective measures are not taken, it will not only delay the time for national investment to be converted into industrial fixed assets, but also increase the difficulty of construction next year. Therefore, we must learn from the lessons of previous years. In winter construction or finishing projects, while seizing the construction progress, we must strictly ensure the quality of the project and the safety of construction, and earnestly do a good job in fire prevention and security work to ensure the quality of the project. In addition, we should strengthen the leadership of construction sites with heavy tasks in key projects; for those units that have difficulty in completing the tasks, we should promptly organize forces to provide support and assistance.

In the coming period, all enterprises must also do a good job in preparing for next year's construction, prepare a good 1956 annual plan, seize the arrangements for the overall progress of plant construction and overall planning and design, accelerate the design and construction of subsidiary enterprises of new industrial bases, do a good job in the adjustment and deployment of organizational structure and construction technical forces, and the preparation of materials and equipment, and actively create favorable conditions for next year's construction.

According to past experience, when a large number of projects enter the final stage at the end of the year, employees are very likely to generate feelings of pride and complacency and slackening; some people are prone to emphasize lack of experience and lack of courage in winter construction, watching and waiting, and have negative and conservative feelings of wanting to "do less." Whether it is negative conservatism or complacency, it is not conducive to the completion of the national plan, and must be prevented and overcome. The entire construction engineering department, from top to bottom, should promote a working style of humility, prudence, relying on the masses, actively studying, and hard work, establish the determination and confidence to overcome the severe cold and overcome difficulties, and strive to comprehensively and over-fulfill this year's plan and to welcome the more arduous construction tasks next year.

    努力争取全面完成今年的建筑安装任务
    建筑工程部生产局副局长　杜恩训
    一九五五年就要结束了。从现在到年底这段时间，对于建筑安装工程的施工是十分宝贵的。建筑业的职工和工程技术人员应该再接再厉，抓紧时机，百倍努力，为全面地超额地完成今年的建筑安装任务而奋斗。
    在过去的十一个月中，建筑工程部所属建筑安装企业，在各级党委的领导下，在有关部门积极配合支持下，在实现国家计划方面取得了很大成绩。到十月底为止，累计已经完成年计划工作量的百分之八十四点八五，今年继续施工和新开工的第一汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂等三十三项重点工程，截至十月底止，已经完成年计划的百分之八十八点六五。其中重大的单位工程项目有三十七个，到十月底止，已经完成年计划的百分之九十以上。已经竣工和已投入生产的单位工程项目有八个。
    六月份，中央发布厉行全面节约的指示以后，建筑工程部和所属企业为厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费，积极地从各个环节上采取了措施，各企业一般都加强了生产组织领导，普遍地开展了劳动竞赛，许多工地上开始树立了为国家社会主义建设节约积累的新风气。
    通过修订年度计划和编制第四季度计划，各企业对完成今年计划任务的具体步骤做了全面安排，重新平衡了材料、机具、劳动力。各工地抓紧编制并且贯彻执行月、旬综合作业计划和施工作业设计，加强了生产会议制度和调度工作，领导工作人员深入了现场，因而能及时发现和解决问题。多数单位扭转了进度缓慢、质量波动、月月不能完成计划的情况，逐渐消除了施工不均衡的现象。结果，每月完成的工作量逐渐增加。部属企业七至十月份完成的工作量超过上半年百分之十以上，其中重点工程超过百分之三十二以上。
    下半年，大多数企业都加强了对技术工作的领导，组织了质量和安全大检查。技术人员不下现场、“不务正业”的现象大大减少，技术质量责任制和质量检查、监督工作逐步加强起来，质量事故特别是重大质量事故从九月份起已经大大减少。
    许多单位都推行了一些切实可行的先进制度和先进技术。如：东北工程管理总局所属企业各工程处，先后建立了经济活动分析委员会，逐月进行经济活动分析。中南工程管理总局所属各工程处，在第三季度也逐步开展了经济活动分析工作，并且根据分析结果，采取有效的措施，因而从八月份起，全局较显著地提高了劳动生产效率，并且消除了工资超支现象。许多工地推行了班、组经济核算。虽然由于经验不足，工作中还有一些问题，但是凡已经推行班、组经济核算的工地都出现了新气象，其中最主要的就是广大职工进一步关心了自己劳动成果。如第一汽车制造厂工地，由于普遍推行了班、组经济核算和相应地试行了基层奖励制度，许多工人都想办法提高工作效率，改进质量和注意安全，利用业余时间拣用旧废残料，因而不仅提高了劳动生产效率，减少了非生产用工，解决了工资超支问题，并且为国家节约了七万多元。
    许多单位在节约材料和处理积压材料方面采取了措施。如加强了供应的计划性，实行定额控制用料，改善了采购运输，因而降低了材料成本。包头总公司，原计划使用外地的细砂，现在使用当地的细砂，每立方公尺可以节约十二点八五元。
    有些单位在施工过程中，推行了先进的技术措施。如华北直属工程公司到九月底为止，在有条件推行里脚手的工程上，已经有百分之六十八的工程推行了里脚手，使每平方公尺工程的造价降低一元。包头总公司由于集中搅拌砂浆和严格控制水泥标号，仅七、八月份就节约水泥四十多吨，节约白灰约一百十五吨。大同总公司体育馆等四个工地，由于采用石灰乳剂油漆，以及利用碎短材制定型模板等先进措施，节约六万多元。某些工地还在砌墙工程上推行钢筋轻质混凝土及五顺一丁、三顺一顶砌砖法和原浆抅缝法，在钢铁结构中采用钢筋冷拉冷压等先进技术。
    基层生产组织和劳动组织也有很大改善。有些工地推行了混合工作队。洛阳工程局简化了工区以下组织层次，取消了工段，工区直接领导工长，便于深入掌握生产。有些工地推行了平行流水作业和快速施工法。有的工地在不增加工人的条件下实行了两班作业。
    各企业普遍贯彻执行一九五五年劳动定额，进一步推行了计件工资制。截至九月底止，建筑安装工程计件工资面总平均已达到百分之六十，其中如东北工程管理总局所属单位平均达到百分之九十以上，华北工程管理总局所属单位平均达到百分之八十八以上。东北八、九月份平均完成新的劳动定额为百分之一百零五点九七；华北大同总公司第三季度平均已达到百分之一百十二点六五。
    在劳动使用方面，进一步加强了计划控制，因而不仅消除了已往两年施工高潮中大量盲目招收临时工，减少了突击赶工的混乱情况，且劳动生产效率有所提高，七月到十一月份平均日产值比上半年增长百分之十六点三四，每千元工作量的实际用工数比去年同期减少了七个工作日，截至十月底止，共少用了三百二十三万多个工日。
    由于开展了节约运动和改进了企业管理工作，下半年的工程成本大大降低。中南工程管理总局七至十月份完成降低成本额为上半年的百分之三百八十七以上，华北、西南、东北等工程管理总局也在百分之一百四十二至一百九十八。
    这一切都为全面和超额完成一九五五年建筑安装工程任务奠定了良好的物质基础。但是就全面工作来看，还有一些薄弱环节和严重缺点。
    今年施工中最突出的缺点就是工程质量事故和安全事故严重。到九月底为止，共发生大小质量事故三千五百九十次，造成经济损失达二十四万元。最近一两月来，情况虽已好转，但是，少数工地仍发生严重事故。某电站变电站工程，有三十八座混凝土柱基都不合设计要求。太原工业学校陈列馆工程，在浇灌的二十根混凝土梁中有十五根报废。东北一公司三工程处有一个工长，在混凝土中掺用十一筐砖头，结果九排屋架被风吹倒。造成这些严重事故的原因，主要是某些领导工作人员和技术人员有“重快”、“轻好”的片面观点，和骄傲自满麻痹大意的思想情绪，没有认真执行国家的技术政策和规程制度。对一些重大事故也没有及时地严肃地处理，甚至有少数人采取迁就和隐瞒态度，这就助长了不负责任现象的发生，给坏分子以可乘之隙。
    许多单位的安全技术和劳动保护工作有一定的改进，伤亡频率比去年降低约百分之五十，重伤频率也降低百分之二十六点零三，疾病率也有所降低。但是，这方面工作的落后状态还不能令人满意，死亡事故比去年反有增加。特别是进入冬季以来，有些企业已发生了工棚被风吹倒，煤气中毒和高空坠落等伤亡、中毒事故。发生这种现象的主要原因，是有些领导工作人员不重视安全技术劳动保护工作，对工人作业安全劳动条件的改善关心不够，在施工任务紧张的时候，往往只顾赶进度，而没有积极地为职工安全生产创造条件，甚至放弃了对安全技术工作的领导和检查，对一些重大的伤亡事故也没有严肃地及时地加以处理，借以吸取教训，教育干部和职工，改进工作。
    应该指出，有些地区今后的施工任务还是很紧张的。西北地区和洛阳地区，还有百分之二十八以上的任务必须在十一、十二两个月内完成。从各企业来看，到十月底为止，有少数单位仅完成年计划的百分之四十三到六十，有些重点工程项目仅完成百分之四十左右。有些企业的劳动生产效率计划和成本降低计划完成得很不好，基本工资、机械使用费和管理费用的超支现象还很严重。如西北工程管理局截至九月底为止，工资基金超支百分之十三点五，机械使用费超支百分之一百四十，行政管理费超支百分之十四点五。该局所属各公司十月份的劳动日产值仅达到年计划日产值的百分之八十九点九。造成这种情况的主要原因，是施工组织不善和生产不均衡。西北工程管理总局今年任务几次突增突减，加上计划管理工作薄弱，造成严重窝工抢工现象，浪费很大。其次是劳动组织不好，调配不合理，缺乏严格计划控制，超计划用工和非生产用工很多，工时浪费很大。如大同总公司第三季度虽然超额百分之四完成计划，却多用了百分之三十九的工时，工资超支达百分之四十五。某工地在机械化施工方面由于计划不准，组织得不好，机械停歇费支出竟占机械使用费的百分之八十八。再次，有的工地由于对收尾工程抓得不紧，作业计划编制得不准确、不及时、不全面，在劳动力、机具、材料供应上和土建、安装、附属企业的协作配合上，不断发生脱节现象，也妨碍工作的正常进行。
    为了更好地实现一九五五年计划，各企业必须抓紧冬季施工和工程收尾工作。今年冬季施工的工业厂房工程占有很大比重。一般工程也大多是为明年施工创造条件的工程，这些工程计划，也必须在年底以前或冬季施工期内完成。特别是西安、洛阳、兰州、太原等地区的任务非常繁重，收尾工程量很大。现在，已有些工程由于抓得不紧，竣工期一再拖延。如不采取有效措施，不但拖延国家投资转为工业固定资产的时间，而且会给明年施工增加困难。因此，必须吸取历年教训，在冬季施工或收尾工程中，在抓紧施工进度的同时，严格保证工程质量和施工安全，切实做好防火保安工作，保证工程质量。此外，应加强重点工程中任务繁重的工地的领导；对那些完成任务确有困难的单位应及时组织力量给予支援和帮助。
    在今后这一段时间内，各企业还必须做好明年的施工准备工作，编好一九五六年年度计划，抓紧安排建厂总进度和总体规划设计，加速进行新建工业基地的附属企业的设计和建设工作，做好组织机构和施工技术力量的调整部署，和材料设备的准备工作，积极为明年施工创造有利条件。
    根据历年经验，时至岁末，大量工程进入收尾阶段的时候，职工极易产生骄傲自满情绪和松劲思想；有些人在冬季施工中，容易强调经验不足，缺乏勇气，观望不前，有想“少干些”的消极保守情绪。不论是消极保守，还是自满，对完成国家计划都是不利的，必须加以防止和克服。整个建筑工程部门，从上到下，应该发扬谦逊谨慎、依靠群众、积极钻研、艰苦奋斗的工作作风，树立战胜严寒，克服困难的决心和信心，为全面地超额地完成今年计划，为迎接明年更加繁重的建设任务而奋斗。
