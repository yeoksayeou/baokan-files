    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo: Yugoslav Federal People's Republic President Tito arrived in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, on December 28 for an official visit.
    That evening, Nasser held a banquet at Abidin Palace to welcome Tito. In his speech at the banquet, Nasser said that the friendship between Egypt and Yugoslavia has been further strengthened by the similar views of the two countries on the fundamental conditions for international peace. He said that true and lasting peace can only be achieved when every country—large or small—has the right to live its own life, formulate its own policies, and take its own attitudes in the way it deems best and correct. Our determination to uphold this principle is based on a sincere desire to contribute to international understanding. Any solution that ignores the legitimate rights of a nation is unjust and cannot maintain lasting peace.
    Nasser expressed his hope to strengthen cooperation between the governments of Yugoslavia and Egypt in political, economic, and cultural fields.
    In his speech, Tito said that the establishment of the Republic of Egypt clearly demonstrates that the people of this vast continent of Africa refuse to be treated as objects of contention in world politics, but hope to be masters, independent and equal members of the international community. This process can be seen clearly in the Bandung Conference.
    Tito said that peace is the basic prerequisite for the peaceful development of all peoples and countries, especially those who have only recently gained sovereignty.
    Tito expressed his firm belief that his visit will further strengthen mutual understanding and broad cooperation between the two countries, and contribute to the realization of international cooperation and world peace.

    纳赛尔举行宴会欢迎铁托到埃及访问
    据新华社讯　开罗消息：南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国总统铁托在十二月二十八日到达埃及首都开罗作正式访问。
    当天晚上，纳赛尔在阿比丁宫举行宴会欢迎铁托。纳赛尔在宴会上讲话说，埃及和南斯拉夫之间的友谊，已经由于两国对国际和平的根本条件的类似看法而进一步加强了。他说，只有在每一个国家——不论大小——有权过它自己的生活，拟订它自己的政策，以它认为是最好的和正确的方式来采取它自己的态度的时候，才能够得到真正的和持久的和平。我们维护这个原则的决心，是基于对国际谅解有所贡献的真诚愿望。任何忽视一个民族的合法权利的解决办法都是不公正的，不可能维持持久和平的。
    纳赛尔表示希望加强南斯拉夫和埃及两国政府之间在政治、经济和文化方面的合作。
    铁托在讲话中说，埃及共和国的成立，清楚地表明了，非洲这个广大的大陆的人民拒绝被当作世界政策的角逐对象，而是希望也能够作为主人，作为国际社会的独立的和平等的成员。在万隆会议上就可以看到这个过程的清晰的表现。
    铁托说，和平是一切人民和国家，特别是那些最近才获得主权的人民和国家的和平发展的基本先决条件。
    铁托表示深信，他的这次访问将进一步加强两国之间的互相了解和广泛合作，并且有助于实现国际合作和世界和平。
