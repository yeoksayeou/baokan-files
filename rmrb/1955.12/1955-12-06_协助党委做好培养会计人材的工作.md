    Assisting the Party Committee in Training Accounting Personnel
    Liu Yunjiang, Secretary of the Communist Youth League of Qingfeng County
    Assisting the Party Committee in training accounting personnel for agricultural cooperatives is one of the important tasks of the rural Communist Youth League organizations. Over the past year, in accordance with this requirement, the Qingfeng County Committee of the Communist Youth League, Henan Province, has actively organized rural educated youth and junior and senior primary school graduates to participate in the work of cooperatives, and has assisted the Party Committee in training more than 1,900 accountants and work-point recorders, which has played a certain role in the development and consolidation of cooperatives.
    With the rapid development of the cooperative movement, Qingfeng County increasingly felt the lack of accounting personnel in the cooperatives, especially skilled accountants. According to the statistics of 972 old cooperatives in the county, 20 cooperatives had no accountants, and the accounting business of 156 cooperatives was not proficient, resulting in chaotic financial management systems and unclear accounts, which affected the consolidation of the cooperatives. In Chen Guixian Cooperative in Yangzhuangyao Village, Sixth District, five members clamored to withdraw from the cooperative due to unclear accounts, and several others wanted to transfer to cooperatives in other villages. In Lujinjing Cooperative in Dianshang Township, Sixth District, the establishment of the cooperative was delayed by two months because there was no accountant. Precisely because of the lack of accounting personnel, coupled with the past negligence of many party members and cadres, counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements took the opportunity to seize the accounting positions of many cooperatives. According to statistics, 42 cooperatives in the county had their accounting positions seized by landlords, rich peasants, Kuomintang members, and Three People's Principles Youth League members. They embezzled public funds, altered receipts, and deliberately created unclear accounts to undermine the cooperative movement. For example, Lu Keqin, the accountant of the Fourth Cooperative in Dianshang Township, was a Three People's Principles Youth League member. He hadn't cleared the accounts for more than a year. The cooperative didn't buy mung beans, but he deliberately wrote that he bought 400 catties of mung beans, and changed a ten-yuan receipt to thirty yuan.
    Originally, there was no difficulty in training accounting personnel. Qingfeng County had 1,042 junior and senior primary school graduates who had transferred to agricultural production. If we add other educated youth in rural areas, it should be said that the source of accounting personnel for cooperatives is not a problem. However, in the past, the Youth League organization did not do enough labor education work for rural educated youth, so many young people despised accounting work. They felt that dealing with abacuses and account books all day was not "promising," so they ran around, asking to go to school and become cadres. Liu Guitian, a senior primary school graduate from Shizi Village, was unwilling to work as an accountant when the Youth League branch mobilized him to learn accounting. He went to Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, and other cities to find work. Some rural educated youth had a fear of difficulty, fearing that they would not learn well and be ridiculed by the masses, and fearing that their parents would blame them.
    When mobilizing and organizing rural youth to learn accounting work, the Qingfeng County Committee of the Communist Youth League first grasped ideological education. According to the instructions and requirements of the County Party Committee, full ideological mobilization was carried out within the League, and then the Youth League committees of each district convened meetings of graduates to conduct socialist future education for them. Through the method of "thinking about the past, looking at the present, and looking forward to the future" of investigation and comparison, they recognized the prospects of socialist society and the bright future of doing a good job in accounting; at the same time, they also used the specific examples of many young people at home and abroad who did a good job in accounting to break the concerns of some young people who feared that they would not learn well and be ridiculed. Under the leadership of the Youth League branch, the seventeen senior primary school graduates of Dianshang Township in the Sixth District calculated the number of accountants lacking in the cooperatives in their township (all ten cooperatives in the township need twenty accountants, but now there are only eight, one of whom is a landlord and one a rich peasant), and discussed the difficulties and problems brought about by unclear accounts in the Fourth Cooperative and the lack of accountants in the Sixth Cooperative. This made them realize the importance of accounting work in cooperatives and said that they must learn accounting well. Under the leadership of the Youth League branch, the senior primary school graduates of Hancun Village visited Zhang Xuexiu's cooperative. After seeing their bumper harvest achievements and hearing about the glorious deeds of Cooperative Director Zhang Xuexiu being selected as a provincial model and visiting the Soviet Union, they greatly enhanced their enthusiasm for loving the country and loving the cooperative. Youth Ma Zuoshi said: "This has solved my confused thoughts. In the past, I only knew that being a cadre was glorious and participating in agricultural production was shameful. I didn't know that in the new society, it is also glorious to use culture in production."
    The young people's concerns were dispelled, their understanding was improved, and what followed was how to organize everyone to study. The Qingfeng County Committee of the Communist Youth League basically adopted two methods: one was to select League members and outstanding young people to study in the accounting training class held in the county, and each township successively sent 1,413 young people. The County Committee of the Communist Youth League sent special personnel to provide guidance. At the end of each study session, the County Committee of the Communist Youth League called on everyone to help improve the local accounting self-study groups after returning to their hometowns; at the same time, they should have the spirit of overcoming difficulties, not be discouraged when encountering difficulties in their work, and humbly learn from the accountants of the old cooperatives. The Youth League Committee also helped everyone organize mutual aid groups based on the distance of the region, and often exchanged experiences. Another method was to use local materials and train them locally. At the beginning of the wheat harvest last year, the County Committee of the Communist Youth League selected Dianshang Township as a key point and established a 25-member accounting self-study group, in which veteran cooperative accountants trained young accountants using the method of taking on apprentices. Last fall, the number of accounting self-study groups in the county increased to 25, with 266 young people participating in the study. By June of this year, it had expanded to 56, with a total of 578 people. At the same time, the people's schools in 30 townships also conducted accounting courses. The accounting courses in the people's schools generally divide the accounting courses into several units, each unit into several lessons, first lectured by veteran cooperative accountants, and then organized students to discuss; if problems that are not understood or are difficult to solve are discovered in the discussion, and cannot be solved in the group meeting, they are collected and answered by veteran cooperative accountants. After each lesson is completed, a test is conducted and a summary is made; after each unit is completed, a summary is made. Those who are active in learning, study hard, and have significant achievements are promptly commended in order to set an example and drive everyone; those who are passive and tired in learning are promptly assisted.
    In order to help the accountants of new and old cooperatives improve their business capabilities, exchange experiences in a timely manner, and solve problems in their work, the Youth League organizations of Qingfeng County also assisted the Party Committee in establishing organizations such as accounting networks, accounting research associations, accounting joint offices, accounting brainstorming sessions, and accounting guidance groups according to different situations. For example, the cooperative accountants of Luli and other three villages meet every night to study their work, and work together when closing accounts and distributing dividends. Dianshang Township also established an accounting "inquiry office" and organized 27 young men and women, such as Ku Dongfa and Jiao Huanmei, who are proficient in accounting, to be guidance group leaders to spread their experience, solve the difficulties encountered in accounting work, and improve the business level of young accountants.
    Based on the work in this period, we have learned that if the Youth League organization wants to do a good job in training young accounting personnel, it must first obtain the attention and support of the Party Committee and the close cooperation and support of relevant departments. On the part of the Youth League organization, it must recognize that assisting the Party Committee in doing this work well is an important manifestation of being a good assistant to the Party, and therefore should devote great efforts to this work. Last summer, after seeing the difficulty of the extreme shortage of accounting personnel in the cooperatives, the Qingfeng County Committee of the Communist Youth League formulated a plan to mobilize and organize rural youth to learn accounting work. This plan was valued by the County Party Committee, and the Secretary of the County Party Committee personally added an instruction on it, and at the County Party Representative Conference held in July, he instructed the Party organizations at all levels and relevant departments to assist the Youth League Committee in doing this work well. The County Party Committee's emphasis promoted the attention of Party organizations at all levels and relevant departments to this work, so that the teachers, teaching materials, kerosene, houses, tables, benches, paper, and other problems we encountered in organizing young people to study accounting were properly resolved; the County Agricultural Technology Guidance Station, the County People's Bank, and the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also assigned full-time cadres to be responsible for the technical guidance of the accounting self-study organizations.
    On the part of the Youth League organization, the Secretary of the County Committee of the Communist Youth League personally went down to organize and run an accounting self-study group to create experience; at the same time, the members of the County Committee of the Communist Youth League also divided the work and were responsible for guiding the training of young accountants in various districts, and combined with the central work of the Party, they often went to the countryside to conduct inspections and help solve problems in various places. The District Committees and Township Branches of the Youth League also appointed special personnel to be responsible for this work, and convened various meetings as needed to report, summarize, and deploy the work of training young accountants.

    协助党委做好培养会计人材的工作
    青年团清丰县委书记　刘云江
    协助党委培养农业合作社的会计人材，是农村青年团组织重要任务之一。一年多来，河南省清丰县团委会按照这一要求，积极地组织农村知识青年和初中、高小毕业生参加合作社的工作，协助党委训练培养了一千九百多个会计员和计工员，对合作社的发展和巩固起了一定的作用。
    随着合作化运动的迅速发展，清丰县日益感到合作社会计人材的缺乏，特别是熟练的会计人员的缺乏。据全县九百七十二个老社的统计，没有会计的社有二十个，一百五十六个社的会计业务不熟练，因而这些合作社的财务管理制度混乱，账目不清，影响了社的巩固。六区杨庄窑村陈贵先合作社因账目结算不清，就有五户社员闹着要退社，还有几户要转入别村的合作社。六区店上乡逯进京合作社也因为没有会计，推迟了两个月才把社建立起来。正是由于会计人材缺乏，加上过去不少党员、干部的麻痹大意，因而有不少合作社的会计职务被反革命分子和其他坏分子乘机窃取。据统计，全县有四十二个合作社的会计职务被地主、富农、国民党员和三青团员所窃取。他们在社里贪污公款，涂改单据，故意造成账目不清，借以破坏合作化运动。如店上乡第四合作社的会计逯克勤是个三青团员，一年多没有清理过账目，社里没有买绿豆，他故意写上买绿豆四百斤，把十元的单据改成三十元。
    本来培养会计人材是没有什么困难的，清丰县转入农业生产的初中、高小毕业生有一千零四十二名，如果加上农村的其他知识青年，应当说合作社会计人员的来源是不成问题的。但是，过去由于团组织对农村知识青年的劳动教育工作做得不够，因而青年中间有不少人轻视会计工作，他们认为整天同算盘账本打交道没“出息”，因而东奔西跑，到处要求升学，想当干部。什字村的高小毕业生刘贵田，团支部动员他学会计，他不愿意干，先后到郑州、新乡等城市去找工作。还有一部分农村知识青年有畏难情绪，怕学不好被群众讥笑，怕家长责备。
    清丰县团委会在动员和组织农村青年学习会计工作的时候，首先抓住了思想教育工作。根据县党委的指示和要求，在团内进行了充分的思想动员，再由各区团委分片召开了毕业生会议，对他们进行了社会主义前途教育。通过“想过去，看现在，望将来”的查算对比方法，使他们认清了社会主义社会的远景和做好会计工作的光明前途；同时还用本地和外地许多青年做好会计工作的具体事例，打破了部分青年怕学不好受人讥讽嘲笑的顾虑。六区店上乡的十七个高小毕业生，在团支部的领导下，算了本乡的合作社缺乏会计的数目（全乡十个社，需要会计二十个，现在只有八个，中间还有一个是地主，一个是富农），讨论了第四社因账目不清和第六社没有会计所带来的困难和问题后，使他们认识到合作社会计工作的重要性，表示一定要学好会计业务。韩村高小毕业生在团支部领导下，参观张学修社，看到他们的丰产成绩，听到社长张学修当选省模范到苏联参观的光荣事迹以后，就大大地提高了爱国爱社的热情。青年马作式说：“这下可把我的糊涂思想解决了，过去光知道当干部光荣，参加农业生产丢人，不知道在新社会能把文化用到生产上去也是光荣的。”
    青年们的顾虑解除了，认识提高了，跟着而来的就是怎样把大家组织起来学习。清丰县团委会基本上采取了两种办法：一种是选派团员和优秀的青年到县里举办的会计训练班学习，各乡先后选送去的有一千四百一十三名青年。由县团委派专人进行辅导。在每次学习结束的时候，县团委号召大家回乡以后应帮助搞好本地的会计自学小组；同时，要有克服困难的精神，不要在工作中碰到困难就灰心丧气，要虚心地向老社的会计学习。团委还根据地区的远近帮助大家组织互助小组，经常交流经验。另一个办法是就地取材，就地培养。去年麦收开始，县团委选择店上乡为重点，建立了一个二十五人的会计自学小组，由老社会计采取带徒弟的办法来培养青年会计。去年秋后全县的会计自学小组发展到二十五个，参加学习的青年二百六十六名，到今年六月更扩大到五十六个，共五百七十八人。同时有三十个乡的民校也进行会计课程的讲授。民校会计课的讲授，一般是把会计课程分作几个单元，每一单元又分作几课，先由老社会计讲授，再组织学员讨论；如在讨论中发现有不懂或疑难的问题，小组会上又不能解决，就汇集起来，由老社会计解答。每一课学习结束后，举行测验，作出小结；每一单元学完以后作出总结。对于学习积极、认真钻研，有显著成绩的学员，及时加以表扬，以便树立榜样，带动大家；对于学习消极疲沓的学员，要及时加以帮助。
    为了帮助新老社的会计提高业务能力，及时交流经验，解决工作中的问题，清丰县的团组织还协助党委，根据不同的情况建立了会计网、会计研究会、会计联合办公室以及会计碰头会、会计辅导组等组织，如芦里等三个村的合作社会计每天夜里碰头研究工作，结账分红的时候在一起办公。店上乡还建立了会计“问事处”，组织了会计业务熟练的库东法、焦焕梅等二十七个男女青年为辅导组长，传播经验，解决了会计工作上所碰到的困难，提高了青年会计的业务水平。
    根据这一段时期工作，我们体会到团组织要把培养青年会计人员的工作做好，首先必须取得党委的重视和支持，取得各有关部门的密切配合和支援。在团组织方面则必须认识到，协助党委把这个工作做好，是当好党的助手的一个重要表现，因而应当拿出很大的力量来从事这个工作。去年夏天，清丰县团委看到合作社极端缺乏会计人员的困难情况后，就拟定了一个动员和组织农村青年学习会计工作的方案。这个方案，受到了县党委会的重视，县委书记亲自在上面加了批语，并且在七月间召开的县党代表会议上指示党的各级组织和各有关部门协助团委搞好这个工作。党的县委会的重视，推动了党的各级组织和有关部门重视这一工作，使我们在组织青年学习会计工作中所碰到的教员、教材以及灯油、房子、桌凳、纸张等问题都得到了妥善的解决；县农业技术指导站、县人民银行和县供销合作社还指派了专职干部，负责会计自学组织的技术指导工作。
    在团组织方面，县团委书记亲自下去组织和办好了一个会计自学小组，创造经验；同时县团委会的委员也都分工负责，指导各区的青年会计培养工作，并且结合党的中心工作，经常下乡巡回检查，帮助各地解决问题。团的区委会和乡支部也都指定专人负责这个工作，并且根据需要，经常召开各种会议，汇报、总结和布置培养青年会计的工作。
