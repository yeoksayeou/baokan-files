Xinhua News Agency, December 15th – Chiang Kai-shek's obstruction on December 13th in the United Nations Security Council by using a veto to block the admission of eighteen countries to the United Nations has aroused strong indignation from people at home and abroad.

According to Reuters, a sense of "annoyance" permeated the United Nations headquarters after the simultaneous admission of eighteen countries was vetoed. The report stated that this "annoyance" was mostly directed at "Nationalist China." Many representatives pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's obstructionist activities have made the day for reconsidering the issue of China's representation even closer, because any idea of continuing to consider the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique as representing anyone and allowing them to wield the veto power in the Security Council is "absurd."

The Chiang Kai-shek clique's destructive actions have particularly aroused dissatisfaction among UN member states like India, which advocate for an early resolution of the new member states issue.

According to a United Press International dispatch from New Delhi, Indian political figures pointed out on the 14th that the Security Council's vote on the 13th was proof that the United Nations had fallen into an absurd and illogical state by continuing to recognize the Chiang Kai-shek clique. These figures said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's use of the veto would now certainly cause those countries that support their qualifications in the United Nations to conduct serious consideration and re-evaluation.

Yugoslavia's "Borba," in commenting on the Security Council's voting results on the 13th, wrote: It is clear that what is involved here is a sabotage conspiracy by the Kuomintang, which does not conform to the recommendations of the General Assembly. "Borba" pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's representatives must be quickly expelled from the United Nations. "Politika" also held the same attitude, pointing out that the world public has every right to express impatience with the Security Council's failure, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique's attitude has hindered the universality of the United Nations.

Some countries that were unable to join the United Nations due to the Security Council's vote on the 13th also strongly criticized the Chiang Kai-shek clique. According to Agence France-Presse, Japanese senior officials felt very disappointed and displeased with the Chiang Kai-shek clique's exercise of the veto. Senior officials of the Japanese Foreign Ministry also believe that world opinion will eventually hold the United States responsible for the inability of eighteen countries to join the United Nations simultaneously, because it could have prevented the Chiang Kai-shek clique's sabotage. The influential "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" wrote, "The (Chiang Kai-shek clique's) decision could not have been made entirely on its own without the guarantee of support from the U.S. government. This decision violates the wishes of the majority of world opinion, and all countries responsible for this decision will inevitably be equally blamed." "Tokyo Shimbun" said, "The United States' responsibility is very significant," and it also wrote: The self-digging grave of Nationalist China will become increasingly isolated in the United Nations, and it will eventually be voted out of this world organization.

Italian Socialist Party leader Nenni said after the proposal to admit eighteen countries was vetoed that the United Nations Security Council's vote was absurd. Nenni said: The United States first opposed the collective accession of eighteen countries, which encouraged Chiang Kai-shek, allowing him to make Canada's proposal fail. Nenni said, "Thus, the question arises: Is it possible to allow a representative of a non-existent China to attend the United Nations, even the Security Council, while at the same time allowing the only existing China—the People's Republic of China—to be absent?"

Ceylon opposition leader Bandaranaike also said that the failure of the eighteen-nation package deal caused by the Chiang Kai-shek clique's veto of the Mongolian People's Republic raises questions about the status of the Chiang Kai-shek clique as a member of the United Nations.

France's "Liberation" published a commentary saying that the difficulties in the Security Council were caused by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which does not represent anyone in the United Nations. "L'Humanité" pointed out: "Expelling the Chiang Kai-shek clique and restoring China's legitimate rights is an urgent task for the United Nations."

    联合国内外人士强烈谴责蒋贼分子的破坏
    新华社十五日讯　蒋介石分子十二月十三日在联合国安全理事会中以否决票阻挠接纳十八个国家加入联合国一事，引起了联合国内外人士强烈的愤慨。
    据路透社消息说，在同时接纳十八个国家加入联合国的提案被否决以后，联合国总部弥漫着一种“恼怒的情绪”。消息说，这种“恼怒情绪”大部分都是针对着“国民党中国”的。许多代表指出：蒋介石分子的阻挠活动已经使得重新考虑中国代表权问题的日子更为接近，因为任何再要认为台湾蒋介石分子代表任何人并且让他在安全理事会中掌握否决权的想法都是“荒谬”的。
    蒋介石分子的破坏行动特别引起像印度这些主张早日解决新会员国问题的联合国会员国的不满。
    据合众社新德里消息说，印度政界人士在十四日指出，安全理事会十三日的投票是一个证据，证明联合国已经由于继续承认蒋介石分子而陷于荒唐背理的地步。这些人士说，蒋介石分子使用否决权一事现在一定会使那些支持他们在联合国的资格的国家进行认真的考虑和重新估价。
    南斯拉夫“战斗报”在评论安全理事会十三日投票结果的时候写道：很明显，这里牵涉到国民党的一个破坏阴谋，这种阴谋是不符合大会的建议的。“战斗报”指出，必须迅速地把蒋介石的代表从联合国中驱逐出去。“政治报”也抱有同样的态度，它指出，全世界的公众完全有权利对安全理事会的这个失败表示不耐烦，蒋介石分子的态度阻碍了联合国的普遍性。
    由于安全理事会十三日表决结果而不能加入联合国的一些国家也猛烈抨击蒋介石分子。据法新社报道，日本高级官员对蒋介石分子行使否决权感到非常失望和不快。日本外务省高级官员并且认为，世界舆论终将会把十八国不能同时加入联合国的责任加在美国身上，因为它原可以阻止蒋介石分子的破坏。有影响的“日本经济新闻”写道，“（蒋介石分子的）决定不可能是完全自己作出而没有美国政府的支持的保证的。这个决定违反了世界舆论多数的希望，对这个决定负有责任的所有国家将必然同样受到指责”。“东京新闻”说，“美国的责任是很重大的”，它还写道：自掘坟墓的国民党中国在联合国中将越来越孤立，它最后将被表决驱逐出这个世界组织。
    意大利社会党领袖南尼在接纳十八国的提案被否决以后说，联合国安全理事会这个表决是荒谬的。南尼说：美国首先反对十八个国家集体加入，这就鼓励了蒋介石，使他可以使加拿大的建议归于失败。南尼说，“这样就出现了这样的一个问题：是否能允许一个并不存在的中国的代表出席联合国，甚至出席安全理事会呢，同时是否还能允许唯一存在的中国——中华人民共和国缺席呢。”
    锡兰反对党领袖班达拉纳克也说，关于蒋介石分子否决蒙古人民共和国而造成的十八国一揽子交易的失败引起了关于蒋介石分子作为联合国的一个成员国的地位问题。
    法国“解放报”发表评论说，安全理事会中的困难是在联合国中不代表任何人的蒋介石分子造成的。“人道报”指出：“驱逐蒋介石分子和恢复中国的合法权利对联合国来说是迫切需要做的事。”
