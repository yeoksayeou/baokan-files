Collective production is advanced planned production
    He Cheng
    How can one tell if a cooperative is well-run or not? The most important thing is to see how its production results are. It goes without saying that the members are most concerned about the production of their own cooperative. Farmers who have not yet joined the cooperative are also watching the production of the cooperative every day to see if the cooperative's production is really stronger than their own. Some people, mainly the more prosperous farmers, have already seen that the cooperative has increased production, but it is not much higher than their own yield, so they are not willing to join the cooperative, and are secretly trying to compete with the cooperative again! Let them take another look, let them compete, we can guarantee that the cooperative's production will exceed all the prosperous farmers within a few years, and will greatly exceed them in the future! This is because the cooperative implements collective production, and collective production is fundamentally different from the decentralized production of small farmers. The decentralized production of small farmers is generally backward and unplanned production; the collective production of cooperatives is advanced and planned production.

    Reasonable use of cultivated land
    What is advanced production? The draft model charter stipulates in Chapter 1: "Agricultural production cooperatives, on the basis of unified use of land and collective labor, should use advanced agricultural production tools as much as possible, continuously improve agricultural technology, and gradually realize the mechanization and electrification of agriculture with the help of the state and the working class." The various methods for improving the level of production proposed in Chapter 6 are the magic weapons for changing backward production into advanced production in the current stage. Most of these magic weapons can only be used by cooperatives, and individual households can hardly use them or cannot use them at all. These magic weapons for improving the level of production can be roughly divided into four aspects: reasonable use of cultivated land, basic construction, improvement of production technology, and development of diversified economy.
    The land that has already been cultivated in our country is, generally speaking, very little when divided among each person. Therefore, the rational use of cultivated land is particularly important at the present stage. For example, connecting small pieces of cultivated land into large pieces; planting whatever crops are suitable according to soil, water conservancy, climate, and other conditions, can greatly increase yield. Obviously, only cooperatives can fully do this. After organizing the cooperative, it should make the best possible use of the cooperative's superior conditions to give full play to this magic weapon.
    Closely related to the rational use of cultivated land is the need to carry out basic agricultural construction. Such as building water conservancy projects, adding new agricultural tools, repairing cultivated land, improving soil, reclaiming wasteland, afforestation, etc. Basic agricultural construction is to lay the foundation for the production of agricultural cooperatives, it is like a factory building a plant and installing machines. Production cannot be developed without doing so. These things can only be done on a relatively large scale after a cooperative has been established. Agricultural production cooperatives should also actively use their superior conditions so that these magic weapons can continue to play a role. Of course, when doing these things, it is necessary to calculate how much production funds the cooperative has that can be used in this area; it is necessary to investigate and study the climate, soil, drought, and flood conditions in the region, that is, "should be based on its own economic conditions and local natural conditions" as stated in the draft model charter. It is wrong, of course, to fail to recognize the benefits of basic agricultural construction to the long-term development of production in cooperatives and to fail to actively carry it out; however, ignoring the conditions and engaging in basic construction in a disorderly manner will also "waste manpower and money" and not produce good results.
    Among the various methods proposed in Chapter 6 of the draft model charter, many are improvements in agricultural technology. Such as improving cultivation methods, mastering the technology of using new agricultural tools, rational fertilization, improving crop varieties, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. The draft model charter also specifically stipulates: "Agricultural production cooperatives should actively promote and organize members to study scientific knowledge and production technology, and reward members for their creations in production. The cooperative should cooperate with agricultural scientific institutions and agricultural technology promotion stations to improve the technical level of its members, train its own technical personnel, and actively promote various advanced experiences in accordance with specific conditions." Improving agricultural technology is like learning to accurately use new weapons in battle. You cannot win a battle without learning the techniques of using new weapons, and you cannot increase production without improving agricultural technology. Improving technology can also be done more effectively only after a cooperative has been established.

    Develop diversified economy
    Another obvious feature of collective, advanced agricultural production is that it can develop a diversified economy. What else can a general agricultural production cooperative operate besides general agricultural production? According to the provisions of the draft model charter, there are handicrafts, transportation, animal husbandry, fishery, forestry, and so on. There are many benefits to developing a diversified economy. Doing so can fully utilize the cooperative's manpower, material resources, and financial resources, can provide work for semi-able-bodied people, can help agricultural production (for example, can add funds and fertilizers, can maintain soil and water, etc.), can increase the income of all members, can produce more things for the people of the whole country, and can make the entire rural area more lovely. Some people think that agricultural cooperatives engaged in sideline occupations are taking the capitalist road, but they are wrong. Taking the capitalist road is doing things that exploit people; engaging in legitimate sideline production is to increase income through labor, how can it be said to be taking the capitalist road? Of course, developing a diversified economy is not the more the better, nor is it that any business can be operated casually. According to the provisions of the draft model charter, agricultural production cooperatives must abide by two conditions when engaging in sideline production: one is that it does not hinder agricultural production, and the other is that it does not engage in commercial speculation. In the past, there was such an agricultural cooperative in Liaoning Province. Under the control of the idea that sideline occupations were "quick to make money" and "earn a lot," the backbone and members of the cooperative used a large amount of manpower, animal power, and funds to run a flour mill, but dozens of hectares of land were left unattended. The local people said it was a "cooperative that did not do its job." Doing so greatly reduced agricultural production, which was detrimental to the country and to the members. Agricultural cooperatives should not engage in commerce under any circumstances. Some agricultural cooperatives in disaster areas wanted to engage in commerce under the pretext of "few sideline opportunities in disaster areas," but that could not be allowed. Members of every cooperative should resolutely abandon the idea of making money in commerce. Otherwise, wouldn't it become "people walking on the socialist road, but their hearts are turning on the capitalist road"!
    Advanced, diversified collective production does not exclude any labor force. In the past, some cooperatives always felt that there was a surplus of labor force, so they excluded poor households with weak labor from joining the cooperative, and restricted female members from participating in the collective labor of the cooperative. In fact, as long as we do our best to carry out basic construction, improve agricultural technology, and develop a diversified economy, we will find that the labor force is not redundant, and often feels insufficient! The draft model charter stipulates: "Agricultural production cooperatives should mobilize all male and female members to actively participate in the agricultural and sideline production labor of the entire cooperative. The cooperative should try its best to help female members overcome the obstacles and difficulties encountered in participating in production, and pay attention to their strengths and characteristics when allocating production tasks." Every cooperative should do this.

    Planned production
    Collective production must be planned production. Article 4 of the draft model charter stipulates: "The production of agricultural production cooperatives should be planned."
    Cooperatives that implement unified management and collective labor have great advantages that individual farmers cannot compare with. However, this superiority cannot be shown by doing whatever you want. This superiority can only be shown by organizing production in a planned way. In the past, many leading personnel and general members of cooperatives did not have enough understanding of this point. Some cooperatives did not seize the time to formulate production plans after they were built; some cooperatives formulated production plans sloppily, and the purpose of formulating production plans was not to implement them, but only to show others. Such plans were as good as nothing. You should know that for an individual farmer, the scale of production is very small, and production without a plan can still be barely tolerated; however, if a cooperative does not have a production plan and blindly does things, it will cause great losses. Because the cooperative has a large family and a large business, it has a lot of land to cultivate, there are many kinds of crops to be planted, and it has dozens or hundreds of laborers. What crops should be planted on what land, how much should be planted for each crop, how much yield should be achieved, and what should be done to achieve it, these must be planned in advance. What basic construction and sideline production should the cooperative engage in, these must be planned in advance. In order to complete the agricultural and sideline production tasks, how much labor and animal power are needed, and how much means of production are needed, these must be planned in advance. With a correct production plan, the cooperative has a direction and a goal; everyone is heading towards the overall goal, and after a period of time, they can turn back and check how well the plan has been completed. If it is not completed well, effective measures can be taken in time to make up for it. At the same time, with a production plan, it is possible to roughly calculate how many labor days each member household can do in a year and how much income can be increased. In this way, they have a number in their minds, and their enthusiasm for labor will be greatly increased.
    What principles should cooperatives follow when setting production plans? Is it possible to decide to produce a large quantity of whatever is most profitable to produce at the moment? This cannot be done. Chapter 1 of the draft model charter stipulates: "The production plan and product sales plan of the cooperative should be based on its own specific conditions, and should also adapt to the national production plan and purchase plan." Will this be detrimental to the members? Absolutely not. Only when the production of the cooperative is consistent with the requirements of the state can the members get the greatest benefit. Only the state can clearly see what is most beneficial to the people to produce at present. The cooperative can only see what was profitable to produce last year; however, if everyone is rushing to produce things that were profitable last year, and the production is too much, and other things that are most needed are too little, everyone thinks, who will this benefit?
    How long should the production plan of the cooperative be set? What should it include? There are also provisions on this issue in the draft model charter. The cooperative should first set an annual production plan, which should be set in the late autumn or winter of the previous year. The annual production plan should gradually include sowing plans and yield plans, labor and animal power utilization plans, means of production supply plans, basic construction plans, and sideline production plans. In order to ensure the completion of the annual production plan, the cooperative should also set a plan for a season or a paragraph according to the local agricultural season or cultivation paragraph. This plan should specifically stipulate the production tasks and the deadline for completing the production tasks.
    To make a good annual production plan, we cannot only look at this year, nor can we only look at our own cooperative, we should make it according to long-term plans, and it should also be suitable for the needs of all aspects of the whole township and village. In this way, we also have to make a long-term plan of more than three years. Just like our country has a five-year plan and also has annual plans. In this way, not only can the annual plan be made better, but also the members and farmers outside the cooperative can see the beautiful future of the collectivized countryside; the members will certainly be more excitedly and enthusiastically engaged in diligent production in order to realize this beautiful vision, and some people who originally did not want to join the cooperative will also actively request to join the cooperative.

    集体生产是先进的有计划的生产
    何成
    一个合作社怎样算是办得好或者不好？最要紧的就是看它的生产成绩怎么样。社员们最关心的就是自己社里的生产，这是不用说了。还没有加入合作社的农民，每天眼睁睁望着的也是社里的生产，要看看社里的生产到底是不是比自己的强。有些人，主要是比较富裕的农民，已经看到合作社增产了，可是还不比自己的产量高很多，就还不愿意入社，还在暗地里使劲要跟合作社再比赛比赛哩！让他们再看看吧，让他们来比赛吧，我们可以打保票：合作社的生产几年以内准能超过所有的富裕农民，以后还要大大地超过！这是因为，合作社实行集体生产，集体生产是跟小农的分散的生产根本不一样的两种生产。小农的分散的生产，一般地说是落后的、无计划的生产；合作社的集体的生产，是先进的有计划的生产。合理使用耕地
    怎样叫做先进的生产呢？示范章程草案的第一章里面就规定了：“农业生产合作社在统一使用土地和共同劳动的基础上，要尽可能地使用进步的农业生产工具，不断地改进农业技术，逐步地在国家和工人阶级的帮助下，实现农业的机械化和电气化。”第六章里提出的提高生产水平的各项办法，就是在目前阶段内，把落后的生产改变成先进的生产的法宝。这些法宝，绝大部分只有合作社才能用得上，单干户很难用或者根本用不了。这些提高生产水平的法宝，大体上可以归成四个方面：合理使用耕地，进行基本建设，改进生产技术，发展多种经济。
    我国现在已经耕种的田地，分到每个人的名下，一般说来还很不多。所以，合理地使用耕地，在目前阶段特别重要。比如说，把小片的耕地连成大片；按照土壤、水利、气候等等条件，什么庄稼合适就种什么，这都能大大提高产量。很明显，这只有合作社才能完全办得到。组织了合作社以后，就该尽可能地利用合作社的优越条件，使这个法宝充分地发挥作用。
    同合理使用耕地相关连，必须进行农业的基本建设。像兴修水利、添置新式农具、修整耕地、改良土壤、开垦荒地、造林等等，都是。农业基本建设就是为农业合作社的生产打根基，它好像工厂盖厂房、装机器一样。不这样做就发展不了生产。这些事，也只有办了社才可能比较大量地做。农业生产合作社也应该积极地运用自己的优越条件，使这些法宝都能不断地发挥作用。当然，在做这些事情的时候，必须盘算一下社里的生产资金有多少可以用在这一方面；必须调查研究本地区的气候、土壤、旱涝等情况，也就是示范章程草案上说的“应该根据本身的经济条件和当地的自然条件”。不认识农业基本建设对合作社长期发展生产的好处，不积极进行，当然不对；不顾条件乱搞基本建设，结果也会“劳民伤财”不落好。
    示范章程草案第六章提出的各项办法当中，有很多是农业技术的改进。像改进耕作方法、掌握使用新式农具的技术、合理施肥、改良作物品种、防治病虫害等等，都是。示范章程草案上还特别规定了一条：“农业生产合作社应该积极地提倡和组织社员学习科学知识和生产技术，奖励社员在生产上的创造。合作社应该同农业科学机关和农业技术推广站合作，提高社员的技术水平，培养本社的技术人员，按照具体条件积极地推广各种先进经验。”改进农业技术就好像打仗学会准确地使用新式武器。不学会使用新式武器的技术就不能打胜仗，不改进农业技术就不能增加生产。改进技术，也只有办了社才可能更有效地做。发展多种经济
    集体的、先进的农业生产还有一个明显的特点，就是能够发展多种经济。一般的农业生产合作社可以经营也应该经营的，除了一般的农业生产以外，还有些什么呢？按示范章程草案的规定，有手工业、运输业、畜牧饲养业、渔业、林业等等。发展多种经济，好处很多。这样做，能把社里的人力、物力、财力充分地运用起来，能使半劳动力也都有活干，能够帮助农业生产（例如，可以增添资金、肥料，可以保持水土，等等），能够使全体社员增加收入，能给全国人民生产出来更多的东西，能够使整个农村面貌变得更可爱。有些人认为农业合作社搞副业就是走资本主义道路，那是他们弄错了。走资本主义道路是做剥削人的事；经营正当的副业生产是靠劳动来增加收入，怎么能说是走资本主义道路呢？当然，发展多种经济，并不是越多越好，更不是随便什么事业都可以经营。按示范章程草案的规定，农业生产合作社经营副业生产，一定要遵守两个条件：一个是不妨碍农业生产，另一个是不进行商业投机。过去辽宁省就有过这样一个农业合作社，社的骨干和社员在搞副业“来钱快”“赚的多”的思想支配下，使用了大批的人力、畜力和资金经营粉房，几十垧地却荒着不管。当地的群众说它是“不务正业的社”。这样做，农业生产大大减产，对国家不利，对社员们也不利。农业合作社不论在怎样的情况下都不应该经营商业。有些灾区的农业合作社以“灾区副业门路少”作借口要搞商业，那也不能允许。每个合作社的社员都应该坚决去掉搞商业赚钱的念头。不然，岂不成了“人在社会主义路上走，心在资本主义道上转”！
    先进的、发展多种经济的集体生产，不排斥任何的劳动力。过去，有些合作社总觉得劳动力有剩余，因此，就排斥劳力弱的困难户入社，就限制女社员参加社里的集体劳动。其实，只要尽力进行基本建设、改进农业技术、发展多种经济，就会发现劳动力并不会多余，常常还会感到不足哩！示范章程草案上规定：“农业生产合作社应该动员全体男女社员积极地参加全社的农业和副业生产劳动。合作社应该尽量地帮助女社员克服参加生产所遇到的障碍和困难，并且在分配生产任务的时候注意到她们的特长和特点。”每个合作社都应该这样办。有计划的生产
    集体生产必须是有计划的生产。示范章程草案第四条就规定了：“农业生产合作社的生产要有计划。”
    实行统一经营和集体劳动的合作社，有着单干农民没法比的很大的优越性。但是，这种优越性并不是随便怎么做都可以显出来。这种优越性只有有计划地组织生产才能显出来。过去有许多合作社的领导人员和一般社员对于这一点认识不够。有些合作社建成后不抓紧时间制定生产计划；有些合作社马马虎虎地制定了生产计划，定生产计划不是为了去执行，只是为了给别人看，这种计划有了也等于没有。要知道，对于一个单干农民来说，生产规模很小，生产没有计划，还可以勉强过得去；可是，一个合作社要是没有生产计划，盲目乱干，结果就要造成很大的损失。因为合作社家大业大，它要耕种的土地很多，要种植的作物有好多种，它的劳动力少的有几十个，多的有几百个。究竟在什么地上种什么作物，每一种作物种多少，产量要达到多少，做些什么事才能达到，这些，事先不计划好就不行。合作社要搞哪些基本建设和副业生产，这些，事先不计划好也不行。为了要完成农业和副业生产任务，需要投进多少劳动力和畜力，需要多少生产资料，这些，事先不计划好也不行。合作社有了正确的生产计划，就有了方向，有了奔头；大家都朝着总的目标奔去，经过一个时期，就可以回过头来检查一下，看看计划完成得怎样。如果完成得不好，就可以及时采取有效办法补足。同时，有了生产计划，就可以大概地计算出来各户社员一年能做多少劳动日，能增加多少收入。这样，他们心中有数了，劳动积极性就会大大提高。
    合作社应该根据什么原则来定生产计划？是不是可以看到目前生产什么东西最有利就决定大量生产什么东西？不能这样做。示范章程草案第一章上规定：“合作社的生产计划和产品销售计划要根据本身的具体条件，同时要适应国家的生产计划和收购计划。”这样做会不会对社员不利？决不会的。只有使合作社的生产同国家的要求一致起来，社员才能得到最大的利益。只有国家才能清楚地看到当前生产什么对人民最有利。合作社只能看到去年生产什么有利；可是，去年有利的东西，今年如果大家都争着生产，生产多了，别的最需要的东西却又太少了，大家想想，这会对谁有利呢？
    合作社的生产计划定多长时间呢？应该包括一些什么呢？关于这个问题，在示范章程草案里也有规定。合作社首先应该定年度生产计划，这个年度生产计划应该在上一年的秋末或冬季就定出来。年度生产计划应该逐步地做到包括播种计划和产量计划、劳动力和畜力的使用计划、生产资料的供应计划、基本建设计划、副业生产计划。为了保证年度生产计划的完成，合作社还应该按照当地的农事季节或者耕作段落，定出一个季节或者一个段落的计划。在这种计划上，要具体地规定生产任务和完成生产任务的期限。
    要把年度生产计划定得好，不能光看这一年，也不能光看自己这一个社，应该根据长远的打算来定，还要适合全乡全村多方面的需要。这样，就还得定出三年以上的长期计划。就像我们国家有五年计划也有每年的计划一样。这样，不但能把每年的计划定得更好，还能使社员和社外农民看到合作化了的农村的美好前途；社员们一定会为实现这一美好远景而更加兴奋鼓舞地勤劳生产，有些原来还不想入社的人，也会积极要求入社。
