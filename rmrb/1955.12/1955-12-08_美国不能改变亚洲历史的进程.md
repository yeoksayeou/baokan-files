    The United States Cannot Change the Course of Asian History
    Jiang Yuanchun
    Just as the people of Asia are actively working to ease international tensions and strive for national independence and economic development, the United States is using the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) it pieced together to intensify war preparations and create tensions in Asia. The Honolulu meeting of the military staff of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, held almost simultaneously with the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference, clearly demonstrated the United States' intention to intensify the "Cold War" in Asia and attack the Asian people.

    The Honolulu meeting, held from November 1st to 15th, was, as U.S. Pacific Commander Stump, who serves as the U.S. military advisor to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, admitted, "another major step" for the United States to achieve its military aggression in Southeast Asia.

    The Honolulu meeting was the second meeting of the military staff of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Its purpose was to make concrete arrangements for the military plans drafted at their first meeting held in Baguio, Philippines on April 25th this year. Prior to the Honolulu meeting, the military staff of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization had held meetings in Singapore, Melbourne, Australia, Auckland, New Zealand, Karachi, and Bangkok for "intense planning work."

    According to the U.S. Information Service, the Honolulu meeting planned the military tasks of each member country and formulated plans for further intervention in Indochina under the pretext of "protection." The meeting exchanged military intelligence of various countries, discussed methods to deal with so-called "subversive activities," and prepared a report requesting member countries to conduct joint training exercises. The meeting also unanimously agreed to implement a certain degree of standardization in military equipment and military procedures in order to "take collective action smoothly and effectively." The meeting also discussed the issue of attracting other Southeast Asian countries to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    According to the U.S. side, the Honolulu meeting will submit a report to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's military advisors meeting to be held in Australia in January next year. The military advisors will make recommendations to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council scheduled to be held in February next year based on the report. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has already announced that he will attend this meeting and will simultaneously visit South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, members of the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization that the United States is planning.

    In the current situation where international tensions have eased, it is not accidental that the United States is intensifying war preparations for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in this way.

    The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a tool for the United States to invade Asia. According to the United States' plan, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization should be linked with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the so-called "Northern Tier Defense" system in the Middle East, and the planned Northeast Asia Treaty Organization to form a military encirclement surrounding China, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries. The United States wants to use these groups to realize its sinister conspiracy of Europeans fighting Europeans and Asians fighting Asians. However, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was met with widespread opposition from the Asian people during its planning process, so that the United States only attracted three Asian countries to participate in this eight-nation group. After the Asian-African Conference and the Geneva Four-Power Summit, the situation in Asia has become even more unfavorable to the United States' war plans.

    The Asian-African Conference promoted trust and cooperation among Asian and African countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, strengthened the confidence of Asian and African peoples in opposing colonialism and defending peace, and dealt a heavy blow to colonial countries that have always used the conspiracy of divide and rule to invade Asia. The Asian and African people realize that as long as they are united, they can resist colonial aggression and consolidate and strive for their own independence and freedom. At the 10th United Nations General Assembly, Asian and African countries showed the amazing strength of this unity in the anti-colonial struggle.

    Asian and African people are also increasingly aware that changing their economic backwardness caused by long-term colonial rule is the primary condition for consolidating and striving for their own independence and freedom. For this reason, it is necessary to maintain peace in Asia and the world and adopt a policy of not participating in any military groups and peaceful coexistence with all countries. Therefore, after the Asian-African Conference, especially the Four-Power Summit, the tendency of neutralism has become prominent in many countries in Asia and Africa. Even in some Asian countries participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, there have been demands to get rid of U.S. control and pursue an independent policy, which makes it not only more difficult for the United States to implement its aggressive policy in Asia, but also puts the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which it has painstakingly pieced together, in danger of disintegrating.

    This new situation in Asia has caused the United States serious concern. In order to reverse this situation, the United States is trying its best to create tensions in Asia, attempting to continue to use the myth of the "communist threat" to force Asian countries to obey the will of the United States, so that the United States can control the development of the Asian situation and suppress the Asian people's struggle for independence. The United States' accelerated planning of war preparations for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is part of this conspiracy.

    The United States attempts to use the war preparations of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to achieve two goals: on the one hand, to intimidate the Asian people and carry out military threats against their struggle for independence, attempting to force them to obey the will of the United States; on the other hand, to strengthen control over the Asian countries participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization through this war preparation, preventing their centrifugal tendencies.

    In order to intimidate the Asian people, the United States has been strengthening its naval and air forces in the Far East, flaunting "strength" to the Asian people, and clamoring for the use of atomic weapons. Under the pretext of suppressing the national liberation struggle of the people of Malaya, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization transported a batch of Australian and New Zealand troops to Malaya, and clamored that these troops would "be used anywhere in Southeast Asia." In other words, they will be used to suppress any people in the Southeast Asian region who are fighting for national independence.

    In order to strengthen control over the Asian member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the United States is urging them to expand their armies regardless of their difficult economic situation, and at the same time, through joint training and exercises, anti-"subversive activities," economic "assistance," and other measures, it is further infiltrating the military, political, and economic departments of these countries, making them deeper into the U.S. war net. The various issues discussed at the Honolulu meeting were also obviously aimed at strengthening the dependence of these Asian countries on the United States, so that the United States can drive them at will.

    However, the United States' attempt to use the war preparations of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to change the course of Asian history is completely futile. The United States' "policy of strength" has suffered a shameful defeat worldwide. It has not succeeded in intimidating the Asian people with military threats in the past, and of course it will not succeed now. The war preparations of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization will not only fail to scare the people of Asian countries, but may not even be able to force the Asian member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to follow the United States forever. The "New York Times" sighed after the Honolulu meeting that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization "is essentially still an organization on paper in the past and now... The real military backbone of this organization is the strength of the United States. In some member states, especially in Thailand, there is a growing neutralism and indifference." This sigh shows that some people in the United States also lack confidence in whether they can always ride on the heads of the people of these countries.

    The situation in Asia will continue to develop in a direction favorable to peace and progress, and no struggle by the United States can reverse this trend. The threat posed by the United States' war preparations to Asian peace can only make the Asian people more clearly realize who is the enemy of their independence and freedom, thereby strengthening their efforts to oppose colonialism and oppose war. The era when the Asian people are masters of their own affairs on the Asian land has arrived, and any attempt by U.S. colonialism to invade Asia can only result in further isolation of itself among the Asian people.

    美国不能改变亚洲历史的进程
    蒋元椿
    正当亚洲人民在积极地为和缓国际紧张局势、争取民族独立和经济发展而努力的时候，美国却利用它所拼凑的东南亚军事集团在亚洲加紧进行战争准备，制造紧张局势。几乎和日内瓦四国外长会议同时举行的东南亚军事集团军事参谋人员的檀香山会议，清楚地表明了美国在亚洲加剧“冷战”、进攻亚洲人民的打算。
    从十一月一日到十五日举行的檀香山会议，正如充当东南亚集团的美国军事顾问的美国太平洋总司令斯图普所承认的，是美国实现它在东南亚的军事侵略目的的“又一个重大步骤”。
    檀香山会议是东南亚集团军事参谋人员的第二次会议。它的目的是要替他们今年四月二十五日在菲律宾的碧瑶举行的第一次会议所拟订的军事计划作出具体的布置。在檀香山会议之前，东南亚集团的军事参谋人员曾经先后在新加坡、澳大利亚的墨尔本、新西兰的奥克兰、喀喇蚩和曼谷举行会议，作了“紧张的策划工作”。
    据美国新闻处透露，檀香山会议计划了每一个成员国的军事任务，制定了在“保护”的借口下进一步干涉印度支那的计划。会议交换了各国的军事情报，讨论了对付所谓“颠覆活动”的方法，准备了一项要求成员国进行联合训练演习的报告。会议还一致同意在军事装备和军事程序方面实行一定程度的标准化，以便“顺利而有效地采取集体行动”。会议还讨论了拉拢其他东南亚国家参加东南亚集团的问题。
    据美国方面宣布，檀香山会议将向明年一月在澳大利亚举行的东南亚集团军事顾问会议提出报告。军事顾问们将根据报告向预定在明年二月举行的东南亚集团理事会提出建议。美国国务卿杜勒斯已经宣布他将出席这个会议，并将同时访问美国正在策划中的东北亚集团的成员南朝鲜、日本和台湾等地。
    在目前国际局势已经有了和缓的情况下，美国这样加紧东南亚集团的战争准备工作，这并不是偶然的。
    东南亚集团是美国侵略亚洲的工具。按照美国的打算，东南亚集团应该同北大西洋集团、中东的所谓“北层防御”体系以及策划中的东北亚集团联结起来，构成包围中国、苏联和各人民民主国家的军事包围圈。美国想要利用这些集团，实现它的欧洲人打欧洲人、亚洲人打亚洲人的恶毒阴谋。但是东南亚集团在策划过程中就遭到了亚洲人民的普遍反对，以致美国只拉拢了三个亚洲国家参加这个八国集团。而在亚非会议和日内瓦四国政府首脑会议以后，亚洲的形势变得对美国的战争计划说来是更加不利了。
    亚非会议在和平共处的五项原则的基础上促进了亚非各国之间的信任和合作，加强了亚非各国人民反对殖民主义、保卫和平的信心，给了一向用分而治之的阴谋侵略亚洲的殖民国家以沉重的打击。亚非人民认识到，只要他们团结一致，他们就能够抵抗殖民主义的进攻，巩固和争取自己的独立和自由。在第十届联合国大会上，亚非国家在反殖民主义的斗争中就显示了他们这种团结的惊人的力量。
    亚非人民也越来越认识到，改变自己由于长期殖民统治所造成的经济上的落后状态，是巩固和争取自己的独立和自由的首要条件。为此就必须维护亚洲和世界的和平，采取不参加任何军事集团、同一切国家和平共处的政策。因此，在亚非会议、特别是四国政府首脑会议以后，中立主义的倾向在亚洲和非洲的许多国家里有了突出的表现。甚至在参加东南亚集团的一些亚洲国家里，也出现了希望摆脱美国控制、奉行独立政策的要求，这就使得美国不但更难在亚洲推行它的侵略政策，而且它所苦心拼凑起来的东南亚集团也有趋于涣散的危险。
    在亚洲出现的这种新形势使美国感到严重的忧虑。为了扭转这种形势，美国竭力在亚洲制造紧张局势，企图继续用“共产主义威胁”的神话来迫使亚洲国家顺从美国的意志，使美国能够控制亚洲局势的发展，镇压亚洲人民争取独立的斗争。美国加紧策划东南亚集团的战争准备工作，就是这个阴谋的一部分。
    美国企图利用东南亚集团的战争准备来达到两个目的：一方面恫吓亚洲人民，对他们争取独立的斗争实行武力威胁，企图迫使他们顺从美国的意志；另一方面通过这种战争准备来加强控制参加东南亚集团的亚洲国家，防止它们的离心倾向。
    为了恫吓亚洲人民，美国一直在加强它在远东的海空军力量，向亚洲人民炫耀“实力”，叫嚣使用原子武器。在镇压马来亚人民的民族解放斗争的借口下，东南亚集团把一批澳大利亚和新西兰的军队运到了马来亚，并且扬言这些军队将“被使用在东南亚的任何地方”。换句话说，它们将被用来镇压东南亚地区的任何为民族独立而斗争的人民。
    为了加强控制东南亚集团的亚洲成员国，美国正在不顾它们的困难的经济情况，督促它们扩充军队，同时通过联合训练和演习、反“颠覆活动”、经济“援助”等等措施，进一步渗入这些国家的军事、政治和经济部门，使它们更深地陷入美国的战争罗网。檀香山会议所讨论的各项问题，也都显然是为了加强这些亚洲国家对美国的依赖，使美国能够随心所欲地驱使它们。
    但是，美国要想利用东南亚集团的战争准备来改变亚洲历史的进程，那是完全徒劳的。美国的“实力政策”已经在世界范围内遭到了可耻的失败。要想凭着武力威胁来恫吓亚洲人民，过去没有成功过，现在当然更不会成功。东南亚集团的战争准备不但吓不倒亚洲各国人民，甚至也未必能够迫使东南亚集团的亚洲成员国永远跟着美国走。“纽约时报”在檀香山会议以后就曾经慨叹说，东南亚集团“实质上过去是现在仍然是一个纸上的组织……这个组织的真正军事骨干是美国的力量。在某些成员国中，特别是在泰国，有着一种日益增长的中立主义和冷淡情绪”。这种慨叹表明，美国的某些人对于他们是不是能够永远骑在这些国家的人民头上也缺乏信心。
    亚洲的局势要继续向着有利于和平和进步的方向发展，美国的任何挣扎都扭转不了这个趋向。美国的战争准备对亚洲和平所造成的威胁，只能使亚洲人民更加清楚地认识到谁是他们的独立和自由的敌人，从而加强他们反对殖民主义、反对战争的努力。亚洲人民在亚洲土地上当家作主的时代已经到来，美国殖民主义侵略亚洲的任何打算，除了使自己在亚洲人民中间更加孤立以外，是不可能得到任何其他的结果的。
