    Chinese Commodity Exhibition in Japan
    --Tokyo Dispatch--
    Huang Long
    During the days of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition in Tokyo, factories, shops, schools, and streets all over the Japanese capital were talking about New China. People in Tokyo were saying a popular phrase: "It only takes ten minutes from Ginza to New China."
    Ginza is one of the most bustling areas in Tokyo, similar to Wangfujing Street in Beijing. From here, a constant stream of people poured into the Chinese Commodity Exhibition held at the Harumi Wharf in the Minato district every day. Over seventeen days, approximately 660,000 people visited the exhibition. Ms. Toshiko Akamatsu, a famous Japanese painter, said, "Seeing such a flood of people, I couldn't help but shed tears. The exhibits at the Chinese Commodity Exhibition are exciting, and the enthusiasm of the visitors is also moving."
    A reporter who had visited China with the Japanese press and broadcasting delegation made a comparison: At the beginning of November, the United States Information Service held an "Atomic Exposition" in the downtown area of Tokyo, and only a little over 4,000 people visited on the opening day; while the Chinese Commodity Exhibition, although located in a relatively remote area, attracted an average of nearly 40,000 visitors every day. He said, "In the past, foreign exhibitions held in Japan did not have so many visitors. This is equivalent to 660,000 people visiting New China."
    Why are the Japanese people so interested in the Chinese Commodity Exhibition? The answers were found in the words of some visitors. An old woman from Nagasaki Prefecture said, "I heard that our neighboring country, China, has become a very good country. I am old, and even if I cannot visit China, I must at least come to see this exhibition." Hiroshi Motoshima, the Director of Education of Tokyo Metropolitan Government, wrote in the guestbook: This exhibition is very helpful for Japanese youth who want to understand New China; it is a good learning opportunity for students. A Japanese female student wrote, "After the visit, I know that Chinese people and Japanese people are the same, with similar food, clothing, and writing. Let us be friendly from now on!" Writer Yasuatsu Takeda believes: "This exhibition further shortens the distance between the Chinese and Japanese people."
    The visitors to the Chinese Commodity Exhibition included not only business people but also workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, ordinary citizens, and people from various political parties and government officials. This was rarely seen in commodity exhibitions held in Tokyo by other countries in the past. On October 30th (Sunday), more than 105,000 people visited, of which 60,000 to 70,000 were workers and students. The famous Ishikawajima Shipyard in Japan had all 8,000 of its workers visit. After the visit, they also invited the workers of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition delegation to their workshops for a get-together. Residents of Yamanashi Prefecture and Nagano Prefecture organized themselves to take special buses to see the Chinese exhibition every day. People from Hokkaido and Nagasaki Prefecture in Kyushu and other places had to take trains for thirty or forty hours. Many housewives brought or carried their children to visit.
    Japanese visitors were very interested in everything displayed at the Chinese Commodity Exhibition. Many people touched the bronze lion in front of the venue as soon as they arrived, and many took pictures there to commemorate the occasion. Three hundred thousand people received beautiful commemorative albums, and everyone liked to put the commemorative seal engraved with a peace dove on the albums or other items to take home. Inside the venue, many people carefully took notes when they saw Chinese industrial products, agricultural products, and even medicinal materials. Some students said that they would discuss it when they returned. After many people bought Chinese silk landscape paintings or other items from the retail department, they took them home to show their relatives and friends or hang them on the wall.
    Japanese audiences were extremely interested in Chinese films. During the seventeen days, 150,000 people watched Chinese movies. The cinema only had 500 seats, but each show often had more than 1,300 viewers. Even when it rained, many people waited in line with umbrellas.
    Seeing the machines and various industrial products at the exhibition, the Japanese working people were very excited about the achievements of China's economic construction. A Japanese worker said to the exhibition delegation, "China has abundant resources. In the past, you could not use these endless resources, but now you can. What a bright future you have!" A visitor from Yamanashi Prefecture wrote, "Today it is raining, and I took a three-hour train ride to visit. I am very happy, and I am really moved to see your country's great peaceful construction."
    Many exhibits needed by Japan at the exhibition aroused great interest among the Japanese people and industrialists. Next to the golden grain-like soybean pile, some people couldn't help but grab a handful and repeatedly admire it. Industrialists hoped to be able to purchase Chinese soybeans; Japanese farmers praised the excellent varieties of Chinese soybeans and hoped to obtain good Chinese seeds to plant in their fields. Many people, especially women, expressed the hope that they would soon find beautiful Chinese embroidery, handicrafts, and dried fruits in Japanese stores.
    During the exhibition, the business negotiation reception room set up by the exhibition delegation was crowded with people from morning to night. Thousands of representatives from Japanese factories and commercial firms conducted business negotiations involving various aspects with the exhibition delegation. Some merchants from far away came by plane.
    Now, the exhibition has been exhibited in Osaka. It is expected that the exhibition will be warmly welcomed by the citizens of Osaka because Osaka has a traditional trade relationship with China.

    中国商品展览会在日本
    ——东京通讯——
    黄龙
    中国商品展览会在东京展出的日子里，日本首都的工厂、商店、学校和街头巷尾，到处都在谈论新中国。东京的人们说着这样一句流行话：“从银座只要十分钟就到新中国。”
    银座是东京最繁华的地区之一，好似北京的王府井大街。从这里，每天都有络绎不绝的人流涌向设在港区晴海码头的中国商品展览会。十七天中，到展览会参观的约有六十六万人。日本著名画家赤松俊子女士说：“看到这样的洪流，我忍不住掉了眼泪，中国商品展览会的展品是使人兴奋的，而参观的人们的热情也是令人感动的。”
    一位随同日本新闻界广播界访华代表团到过中国的记者作了一个比较：十一月初，美国新闻处在东京的市中心区举行了一个“原子博展会”，开放的头一天，也只有四千多人去参观；而中国商品展览会虽然设在比较偏僻的地区，每天却平均有近四万人去参观。他说：“过去外国在日本举办的展览会，是没有这么多的观众的。这等于六十六万人访问了新中国。”
    日本人民为什么对中国商品展览会发生这样大的兴趣呢？这从一些参观者的口里得到了回答。来自长崎县的一位老太太说：“我听说邻邦中国已经变成了很好的国家，我老了，即使不能到中国去访问，至少也要到这个展览会来看一看。”东京都教育部长元岛宽在留言簿上写道：日本青年想要了解新中国，这个展览会是非常起作用的；对学生来说，这是很好的学习机会。一个日本的女学生写道：“参观后，我知道中国人和日本人一样，吃的东西、服装、文字都很相似。让我们从现在友好起来吧！”作家武田恭淳认为：“这个展览会进一步缩短了中日人民间的距离。”
    参观中国商品展览会的不只有工商界人士，而且还有工人、农民、学生、知识分子、一般市民和各政党人士、政府官员等各个阶层的人士。这是其他各国过去在东京举行商品展览会时很少见的。十月三十日那天（星期日），参观的有十万五千多人，其中有六、七万是工人和学生。日本著名的石川岛造船厂，八千名工人全来参观了。看完后，他们还邀请中国商品展览团的工人们到他们的车间去开联欢会。山梨县和长野县的居民组织起来，每天乘专用公共汽车来看中国展览会。来自北海道和九州的长崎县等处的人，要坐三、四十小时的火车。不少家庭妇女，领着和背着小孩子来参观。
    日本的观众对中国商品展览会陈列的一切都感到很大的兴趣。有许多人一到门口，就摸摸会场前面的铜狮子，不少人并在那儿摄影留念。有三十万人得到了美丽的纪念画册，大家都喜欢把刻有和平鸽子的纪念图章盖在画册上或其他东西上带回家去。在会场内，不少的人看到中国的工业品、农产品以至药材等，都在仔细地记笔记。有些学生说，他们回去后还要讨论。许多人从零售部买到中国的丝织风景画或其他物品后，回到家里就拿给亲友看或在墙上挂起来。
    日本观众对中国的电影感到极大的兴趣。在十七天中，有十五万人看了中国电影。电影院只有五百个座位，但每一场观众常有一千三百多人。下雨的时候，也有许多人撑着伞排队等候。
    看到展览会上的机器和各种工业品，日本的劳动人民对中国经济建设的成就感到非常兴奋。一个日本工人对展览团的人说：“中国有丰富的资源，过去你们无法利用这些无尽的资源，现在能利用了，你们的前途多么光明啊！”来自山梨县的一位观众写道：“今天下雨，我坐了三个小时的火车来参观，感到非常高兴，我看到了贵国的伟大的和平建设，实在是感动。”
    展览会上许多为日本所需要的展览品，引起了日本人民和工商业家的极大兴趣。在黄金粒似的大豆堆旁边，有的人情不自禁地抓起一把，反复观赏。工商业家希望能够购买中国的大豆；日本的农民们赞扬中国大豆品种优良，希望能得到中国的良种种在自己的田地里。许多人，尤其是妇女们表示：希望能早日在日本的商店里，发现优美的中国刺绣、手工艺品和干果等。
    在展览期间，展览团设立的交谈生意的接待室里，每天从早到晚挤满了人，成千的来自日本工厂、商行的代表，和展览团的人员进行着涉及各方面业务的交谈。有一些远处的商人，是乘飞机赶来的。
    现在，展览会已在大阪展出。人们预料，展览会将得到大阪市民的热烈欢迎，因为大阪和中国有着传统的贸易关系。
