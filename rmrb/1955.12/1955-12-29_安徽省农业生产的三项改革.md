Three Reforms in Agricultural Production in Anhui Province
By Our Correspondent Yu Ming

A Major Victory in Agricultural Production

Anhui Province reaped an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. The total grain output of the province reached 22.7 billion jin, an increase of one and a half times compared with 1949, and an increase of more than 4.8 billion jin compared with 1953. This year, Anhui Province exceeded the grain production target for the last year of the First Five-Year Plan by 3.6 billion jin. In addition, cotton and tea also overfulfilled this year's production plan.

As of December 10, Anhui Province had victoriously completed the annual grain purchase task of more than 6 billion jin by an excess of more than 650 million jin. After completing the unified purchase task, farmers are still continuously selling their surplus grain to the state every day. Anhui Province, which in previous years of severe disasters required the state to transfer in large quantities of grain, is now transferring large quantities of grain to other regions, supporting national industrial construction. This year's bumper harvest has greatly restored the vitality of the rural areas that suffered the worst flood in a century last year. Farmers in disaster-stricken areas have added new means of production and means of livelihood. According to a survey of Jiaoji District, a severely affected area in Wuwei County, there were a total of 576 head of cattle before the disaster, only three remained after the flood, but now it has recovered to 759 head. There were 415 pigs in Xinqiao Township, all of which were lost during the flood, but now it has recovered to 1,126 head. The houses in the disaster area have also been repaired, and farmers have added new clothes.

How did Anhui Province achieve such an unprecedented bumper harvest this year? The good weather from late spring to before autumn, and the fact that it did not suffer major disasters, and the major water conservancy projects built by the state over the years have played a certain role are all important reasons, but the main reason is that the Party organizations and the government of Anhui Province relied on agricultural production cooperatives and led the broad masses of farmers to implement three reforms in agricultural production (referred to as the "Three Reforms").

What are the "Three Reforms"?

Anhui Province is a region that has historically suffered frequent natural disasters. The hilly areas and mountainous areas of Huainan are prone to drought, while the areas along the Huai River and the Yangtze River are often hit by floods. Once a flood comes, tens of millions of mu of land are submerged and unharvested. The reason why the Huai River basin, especially the Huaibei area, often suffers disasters is: First, the annual rainfall is extremely unbalanced. There is little rain between January and June, making it easy to have droughts; while in July, August, and September, there are often continuous heavy rains, causing flood disasters. According to historical records and post-liberation surveys, in the Huai River basin, a major flood occurs every ten or twenty years, and a minor flood occurs every five years. Since the Kuomintang bandits breached the dikes at Huayuankou in 1938, diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River, the Huai River has suffered disasters almost every year. Second, the Huai River basin has a large plain area and a small slope, so the impact of water is small. Whenever there is heavy rain, it is easy to have floods. Also, because part of the riverbed of the Huai River is small and the mountainous area is close to the river, whenever there is heavy rain, floods come suddenly, and the river channel cannot accommodate the discharge, making it easy to cause flood disasters. Third, the sesame, soybeans, and other dryland crops planted in the Huai River basin are not resistant to water. The Yangtze River area has large rains just when water-resistant crops like rice need it, but the crops in the Huai River area that are not resistant to water are drowned or damaged. Fourth, the masses in the Huai River basin, who have suffered from feudal exploitation and constant disasters in the past, had neither the strength nor the confidence to carry out intensive cultivation, and developed the habit of extensive planting and low yields. The yields of general crops were very low. Shortly after liberation, Chairman Mao put forward the call to "harness the Huai River well." The Party and the government led the broad masses of people to carry out and are still carrying out large-scale Huai River harnessing projects: reinforcing dikes, dredging and opening new river channels, and building many large-scale sluices and flood storage projects. These water conservancy projects have already had a positive effect in reducing disasters. However, huge flood prevention and drainage projects cannot be completed in a short period of time. Completely eliminating disasters, especially floods, in the Huai River basin will take a considerable amount of time. The Party and government leading organs of Anhui Province believe that we cannot wait until the water conservancy projects are completed in the future before increasing production, but should take possible and effective measures from now on to adapt to natural laws, avoid disasters or limit the scope of disasters, and gradually improve agricultural production in order to improve people's lives and support industrial construction. Starting from this principle, the Party and government leading organs of Anhui Province, on the one hand, led the masses to actively carry out flood prevention and drainage water conservancy projects; on the other hand, they conducted in-depth investigations and studies, summarized the masses' experience, and, based on the natural and production conditions of the Huai River basin, proposed three reforms in agricultural production in 1953. The basic content of these three reforms is: First, change the proportion of harvests in summer and autumn, that is, expand the sowing area in autumn and winter, and increase the proportion of summer harvest in the total annual harvest. Second, change to planting high-yield crops and flood-resistant and drought-resistant crops; Third, change the production habit of extensive planting and low yield, and promote production technology reform. The rationale for proposing these three production reforms is: First, although Anhui Province has many disasters, summer crops have never failed due to disasters in history, so changing the proportion of summer and autumn crops and expanding the summer crop sowing area can avoid the floods that come in autumn and obtain more harvests. Second, changing to planting high-yield crops and water-resistant crops, such as changing to planting potatoes and Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes, can not only increase the proportion of summer harvests, but also increase yields. Planting water-resistant, high-yield crops such as rice in low-lying areas can not only increase yields, but also accumulate surface water in vast rice fields to reduce water disasters. Third, changing the production habit of extensive planting and low yield and practicing intensive cultivation can increase underground water storage and reduce water damage. If each mu increases the yield by 20 jin of grain due to deep plowing and water storage, the Huaibei area can increase the yield by 800 million jin of grain. As for fertilizing, weeding, making ridge fields and terrace fields, improving the soil, and using new agricultural tools for cultivation, etc., can also increase production, and these are being promoted and implemented throughout the country.

Achievements in Promoting the "Three Reforms"

The content of the "Three Reforms" has been continuously enriched and developed in the course of practice, ensuring a large increase in agricultural production. The "Three Reforms" were initially proposed based on the specific conditions of the Huai River basin, but the Anhui Provincial Party Committee pointed out from the beginning that its basic spirit and certain methods, especially the measures of changing to planting high-yield crops, should be strived for implementation throughout the province according to its own characteristics. Many regions in the province responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee and, in accordance with the spirit of the "Three Reforms," proposed measures and plans to reform agricultural production in light of local natural conditions and mass conditions. After two years of practice, the Party and government leading organs of Anhui Province further summarized the experience of the masses, making the content of the "Three Reforms" more substantial and richer.

Now, the first method of the "Three Reforms" has developed into "increasing the proportion of summer harvests, increasing the planting of one season of late autumn crops, and promoting a three-crop-a-year cropping system." In 1954, Anhui Province suffered a major flood and drought, but still achieved a harvest of more than 16 billion jin, only 9 percent short of the control target set by the state. The main reason was that the proportion of summer harvests was increased and one season of late autumn crops was increased. In 1955, the sowing area of summer crops in the province was expanded by 6.45 million mu compared with 1954, and the grain output increased by more than 700 million jin; the area of late autumn crops was increased by 11 million mu, and although it suffered a drought, it still harvested more than 900 million jin (including double-cropping rice); intercropping between rows of sweet potatoes, corn, etc., was carried out on 1.7 million mu, which, when converted into rice, increased the output by more than 60 million jin. As a result of promoting the first method, a total of 1.7 billion jin of grain was produced.

The second method of the "Three Reforms" is: "Change to planting high-yield crops, water-resistant and drought-resistant crops, and implement dry-to-wet and wet-to-dry conversions." This is: according to the different conditions of each region, change to planting high-yield crops suitable for the local area to increase yields; convert dry land suitable for planting rice into paddy fields, and convert paddy fields with insufficient water sources into dry land, to increase and ensure harvests. Anhui Province had already gained experience in changing to planting potatoes, Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes, rice, etc., in 1954. In 1955, the planting area of potatoes was expanded by 1.28 million mu, increasing the output by 120 million jin compared with sowing wheat (potatoes converted into grain); the planting area of Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes was expanded by 2.25 million mu, increasing the output by 560 million jin compared with local sweet potatoes; the area of dry-to-wet land conversion was expanded by 480,000 mu, increasing the output by 120 million jin compared with planting one season of dry grain. In total, as a result of promoting this method, the total annual output increased by 800 million jin.

Various regions have also achieved remarkable results in promoting the third content of the "Three Reforms," namely, changing the habit of extensive planting and low yield. The scope of implementing measures such as deep plowing, selecting fine seeds, small-row close planting, changing broadcasting to strip planting, fertilizing, and weeding is gradually increasing throughout the province. In the Huaibei area, the fertilization area of summer crops in 1955 increased by 16 million mu compared with 1954, thus increasing the output by 240 million jin.

Of the 4.8 billion jin of grain increased in Anhui Province in 1955 compared with 1953, 2.74 billion jin were obtained due to the implementation of the "Three Reforms."

The "Three Reforms" method is a method of agricultural production reform that requires less money and yields greater benefits. The "Three Reforms" utilize the aspects of natural conditions that are conducive to agricultural production, avoid the aspects of disasters, and, under the existing manpower and material resources, without increasing any equipment, can be promoted relatively easily as long as farmers are organized. It is estimated that the promotion of the "Three Reforms" in 1955 only used 2 million yuan in the price difference of transferring in high-yield crop seeds, etc., and the total investment, including "dry-to-wet conversion" and water conservancy construction, was less than 3 million yuan; while the grain output increased in 1955 reached 2.74 billion jin, with a value of 164 million yuan at 6 fen per jin.

In the spring of 1955, the number of peasant households in Anhui Province participating in agricultural production cooperatives only accounted for more than 15 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province, and the area where the "Three Reforms" were promoted only reached more than 23 million mu, accounting for about 25 percent of the existing cultivated land. This shows that the potential for agricultural production increase in Anhui Province is still very large. If 80 percent of the peasant households in the province participate in agricultural cooperatives in the spring of 1956, and continue to expand the scope of agricultural production reform in accordance with the spirit of the "Three Reforms" and in light of local conditions, the increase in production will be even greater.

    安徽省农业生产的三项改革
    本报记者　于明    
                农业生产的重大胜利
    安徽省今年获得了空前大丰收。全省粮食总产量达到二百二十七亿斤，比一九四九年增加了一倍半，比一九五三年增加了四十八亿多斤。今年安徽省超额三十六亿斤完成了第一个五年计划最后一年的粮食生产指标。此外，棉花、茶叶也都超额完成了今年的生产计划。
    安徽全省到十二月十日止，全省的六十多亿斤的全年粮食征购任务已经超额六亿五千万多斤胜利完成。在完成统购任务以后，目前农民们每天仍在川流不息地把余粮卖给国家。在以往灾情严重的年份需要国家调进大批粮食的安徽省，今年却把大批粮食源源外调到其他地区，支援国家工业建设。今年的大丰收，使去年遭受了百年来未见的特大洪水的农村，大大恢复了元气。去年遭灾的农民添置了新的生产资料和生活资料。据无为县重灾区——蛟矶区的调查统计，灾前共有耕牛五百七十六头，水灾后只剩了三头，现在已经恢复到七百五十九头了。新桥乡原有生猪四百一十五头，水灾期间全部损失，现在已经恢复到一千一百二十六头。灾区的房子也修复了，农民纷纷添置新的衣服。
    安徽省今年的农业空前大丰收是怎样得来的呢？今年春末到秋前气候良好，没有遭受大的灾害；国家历年兴修的大型水利工程发挥了一定的效益等，都是重要原因，但是主要的原因是安徽省的党组织和政府依靠农业生产合作社，领导广大农民实行了农业生产的三项改革（简称“三改”）。
      什么是“三改”
    安徽省是一个历史上经常遭受自然灾害的地区，淮南丘陵地区和山区多患旱灾，而淮河和长江沿岸地区又常遭涝灾。洪水一来，就是几千万亩的土地被淹无收。淮河流域，特别是淮北地区所以常常遭灾，第一、是因为全年降雨量极不平衡，一月到六月之间雨水少，容易旱；而在七、八、九三个月却又经常连降暴雨，造成洪水灾害。根据历史资料记载和解放后的调查，近百年来，淮河流域每隔十年或二十年就发生一次大的水灾，每隔五年要发生一次小水灾；自从一九三八年国民党匪帮在花园口掘开河堤，黄河夺淮以后，淮河几乎年年有灾。第二、淮河流域平原面积大，坡度小，水的冲击力小，每当雨水大的时候，就容易发生涝灾；又因为淮河的部分河床小，山区靠河近，每降暴雨，洪水突然袭来，河道无法容纳排泄，就容易造成洪水灾害。第三、淮河流域一带播种的芝麻、黄豆等不耐水的旱田作物，遇到像长江一带一样大的雨，长江一带的水稻等耐水作物正合需要，而在淮河一带的不耐涝作物却被淹死或淹坏了。第四、淮河流域的群众，过去遭受封建剥削和灾害的不断侵袭，既无力量也无信心进行精耕细作，养成了广种薄收的习惯，一般农作物的产量都很低。解放以后不久，毛主席就提出了“一定要把淮河修好”的号召。党和政府领导广大人民进行了并且还在进行规模巨大的治淮工程：培修堤防，疏浚和开辟新的河道，兴建了许多宏大的涵闸和蓄洪工程，这些水利工程已在减少灾害方面发生了积极的作用。但是，巨大的防洪防涝工程，并非短期内可以完成，彻底消除淮河流域的灾害特别是涝灾，是需要相当长的时间的。安徽省党、政领导机关认为，不能等待将来水利工程完成后再来增加生产，而应该从目前起就采取可能的有效措施，适应自然规律，避免灾害或限制灾害发生的范围，使农业生产逐渐提高，以改善人民生活、支援工业建设。从这一方针出发，安徽省党、政领导机关一面领导群众积极进行防洪防涝的水利工程；一面进行深入的调查研究，总结群众经验，根据淮河流域地区的自然条件和生产条件，在一九五三年提出了农业生产上的三项改革。这三项改革的基本内容就是：一、改变夏秋两季的收成比重，就是扩大秋冬播种面积，提高夏季收获量在全年收成中的分量。二、改种高产作物和抗涝耐旱作物；三、改变广种薄收的生产习惯，推行生产技术改革。提出这三项生产改革的道理是：一、安徽省虽然灾害多，但是历史上夏季作物都没有因灾而无收成，所以改变夏秋季作物的比重，扩大夏季作物播种面积，就可以避开在秋季到来的水灾，获得更多的收成。二、改种高产作物和耐水作物，如改种马铃薯、胜利百号甘薯，既可提高夏季收成比重，又可提高产量。在低洼地区种耐涝、高产作物水稻，不但能提高产量，而且能把地面水在广大稻田里蓄积起来，以减少水灾。三、改变广种薄收的生产习惯，精耕细作，可以增加地下蓄水量，使水害减轻。如果每亩由于深耕蓄水而增产二十斤粮食，淮北地区就可增产八亿斤粮食。至于施肥、锄草、做畦田台田，改良土壤，使用新式农具耕种等，也都能够增产，这些是全国各地都在提倡实行的。
    推行“三改”的成绩
    “三改”的内容在实践过程中不断丰富发展，保证了农业生产的大量增加。“三改”在最初是根据淮河流域的具体情况提出的，但是安徽省委一开始就指出，它的基本精神和某些方法，特别是改种高产作物的措施，全省各地应该根据自己的特点，争取实现。全省许多地区响应省委的号召，都按照“三改”精神，针对当地的自然条件和群众条件，提出了改革农业生产的措施和计划。经过两年来的实践，安徽省党、政领导机关进一步总结了群众的经验，使“三改”的内容更加充实和丰富起来了。
    现在，“三改”的第一项办法，已经发展为“提高夏季收成比重，增种一季晚秋，推行一年三熟的连作制”。安徽省一九五四年遭受特大洪水和旱灾的情况下，仍然取得了一百六十多亿斤的收成，比国家规定的控制指标只差百分之九。主要原因就是提高了夏季收成比重和增种一季晚秋作物。一九五五年全省夏季作物播种面积比一九五四年扩大六百四十五万亩，增产粮食七亿多斤；增种晚秋一千一百万亩，虽然遭了旱灾，还收九亿多斤（包括双季稻在内）；利用甘薯、玉米等行间套种一百七十万亩，折成稻子计算，增产六千多万斤。推行第一项办法的结果，共增产了十七亿斤粮食。
      “三改”的第二项办法是：“改种高产作物，耐水、耐旱作物，实行旱改水、水改旱。”这就是：根据各地的不同条件，改种适于当地的高产作物，以提高产量；把适于种水稻的旱田改为水田，把水源不足的水田改为旱田，以增加和保证收成。安徽省在一九五四年已经取得了改种马铃薯、胜利百号甘薯、水稻等的经验。一九五五年扩大种植马铃薯一百二十八万亩，比播种小麦增产一亿二千万斤
  （马铃薯折合粮食）；改种胜利百号甘薯二百二十五万亩，比当地甘薯增产五亿六千万斤；推行旱改水田四十八万亩，比种一季旱粮增产一亿二千万斤。总计推行这一项办法结果，全年共增产八亿斤。
    各地推行“三改”的第三项内容，即在改变广种薄收习惯方面，也有显著成绩。全省实行深耕、选用良种、小科密植、改撒播为条播、施肥、锄草等措施的范围都在逐渐增加。淮北地区一九五五年的夏季作物比一九五四年增加了一千六百万亩的施肥面积，因此增产二亿四千万斤。
    安徽省一九五五年比一九五三年增产的四十八亿斤粮食中，有二十七亿四千万斤是由于实行“三改”获得的。
     “三改”办法，是在农业生产改革措施中花钱少收益大的办法。“三改”是利用自然条件中有利于农业生产的方面，避开灾害的一方面，在现有人力、物力的条件下，不用增加什么设备，只要农民组织起来，就能比较容易地推行。据估计，一九五五年推行“三改”，仅在调进高产作物种子等的差价上用了二百万元，连同“旱改水”和修水利的投资，共计不到三百万元；而一九五五年增产的粮食却达到二十七亿四千万斤，按每斤六分算，价值一亿六千四百万元。
    一九五五年春天安徽省参加农业生产合作社的农户只占全省农户总数的百分之十五多，推行“三改”的面积也只达到两千三百多万亩，约占现有耕地的百分之二十五，这表明安徽省的农业增产潜力还是很大的。如果一九五六年春天全省有百分之八十的农户参加了农业合作社，并且按照“三改”的精神，继续因地制宜地扩大农业生产改革的范围，那么增产成绩将会更大。
