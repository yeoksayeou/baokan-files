Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 14th: Nikolai Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Nikita Khrushchev, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, held a press conference in Delhi on December 14th, prior to their departure from India, for Indian, Soviet, and foreign journalists. More than 150 journalists representing major news agencies and newspapers from India, the Soviet Union, and foreign countries attended the reception.

Bulganin issued the following statement:

We have made a friendly visit to India at the invitation of the Indian government. Our visit to India, and Mr. Nehru's friendly visit to the Soviet Union in June of this year, are very important for further improving the friendly relations between our two countries and consolidating world peace.

As you already know, the joint Soviet-Indian statement signed yesterday shows the views of Soviet and Indian statesmen on the most important issues in the relations between our two countries and on major international issues. This statement is of great importance for further enhancing the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India. It also has great international significance.

During our stay in India, we visited many cities and provinces, and toured huge construction projects and factories in Bombay, Calcutta, Bangalore, and Madras. We visited agricultural development centers and some Indian scientific institutions. We admired the great relics of ancient architecture. We learned about the lives and work of the multi-ethnic Indian people, and about the achievements they have made in the years of independence. We also gained an idea of India's rich natural resources and huge potential. What impressed us most and will remain indelible is the great Indian people, their lively children and youth, their talent and diligence, and their unwavering will to love peace and cooperate friendly with all countries. We have been warmly received by the Indian people everywhere, which proves their deep sympathy and friendship towards the people of the Soviet Union.

We were also deeply impressed by the Indian people's efforts to develop the national economy, especially the efforts to develop industry, which is the pillar of economic progress and the main and indispensable condition for the independence of any country. The development of the Damodar Valley and the Bhakra-Nangal, the planned steel enterprises, and the preparation of the new Five-Year Plan are undoubtedly important measures taken by the Indian government in developing the national economy.

India possesses everything necessary to successfully develop its national economy: huge natural resources, vast fertile land, and, most importantly, the endless creative power of the wise and hardworking Indian people, who have created immortal cultural monuments in their many centuries of history. Based on our experience in planning the national economy, we, the Soviet people, have the impression that India, thanks to its current efforts to develop its own economy and fully utilize its material and human resources, will be able to greatly increase the output of agriculture and industry in a relatively short period of time, thereby greatly improving the welfare of the people.

The friendly relations that have been established between our two countries provide favorable opportunities for close cooperation between our two countries in the fields of economy, science, and culture. We have said that the Soviet Union is willing to provide its experience in science and technology, its experience in planned economy, and in the construction of industrial enterprises and hydropower projects on the basis of mutual benefit. It will also be very happy to learn from the Indian people's experience in various aspects of economy, science, and culture. We believe that expanding cultural ties between India and the Soviet Union will help further strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries.

We are pleased to point out that, as a result of our visit to India and our talks with Mr. Nehru and other Indian leaders, agreements have been reached on some important issues regarding the further expansion of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and India.

What we have seen during our stay in India has convinced us that the Indian people are enthusiastically striving for peace and are willing to resolutely fight to maintain and consolidate peace. India is playing an increasingly important role in resolving international issues and establishing friendly relations between countries. In Asia, and not only in Asia, there are no major issues that can now be resolved without the participation of India and the People's Republic of China. Obvious examples of India and the People's Republic of China actively and effectively participating in resolving international issues include the role they played in ending the war in Indochina, and the fact that they actively participated in the Bandung Conference, which played a significant role in easing international tensions and developing cooperation between Asian and African countries.

The Soviet Union and India now base, and will continue to base, their relations on the well-known Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, because these five principles are in the interests of all peace-loving people and in the interests of peace. These principles are fully in line with the foreign policy pursued by the Soviet government since the founding of the Soviet Union. These principles have been endorsed by many countries and form the basis of the resolutions of the Bandung Conference. If other countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, also endorse these principles, it would be an important step in further easing international tensions and establishing the necessary trust between nations. As for the Soviet Union, it has always pursued and will continue to pursue a policy of peace and respect for the sovereign rights of all peoples, a policy of non-aggression, equality and mutual benefit, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and a policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and political systems. This policy stems from the essence of the Soviet state, which consistently adheres to a policy of peace.

As everyone knows, there are still many extremely urgent Far East issues that need to be resolved. Specifically, the Indochina issue can only be fully and finally resolved on the basis of the Geneva Conference resolutions on Indochina. The important issue of granting the People's Republic of China its legitimate status in the United Nations can no longer be delayed, nor can the issue of Taiwan and other coastal islands, which are an indivisible part of Chinese territory, be delayed from being resolved in accordance with the national rights of the Chinese people.

The Soviet government has always opposed the establishment of any kind of military blocs and military bases on foreign territories around the world, because organizing such blocs and establishing such bases is a serious threat to peace and creates new obstacles in the way of easing international tensions and strengthening peace. We believe that the true security of all nations can only be guaranteed through joint collective efforts aimed at consolidating peace, rather than through the establishment of military blocs.

The Soviet government's well-known proposal for a European collective security system stems from these considerations.

The current arms race and the continued manufacture and stockpiling of atomic and hydrogen weapons are fraught with threats to peace and place a heavy burden on the working people, who are overwhelmed by military expenditures. We know that reducing armaments and completely and unconditionally banning atomic and hydrogen weapons is an urgent task facing all countries today, especially all major powers. Of course, as long as no agreement has been reached on this issue, the Soviet Union must continue to strive to strengthen its national defense and manufacture atomic and hydrogen weapons. There is no other way under the current circumstances.

As we leave India, this hospitable country, we express our deep gratitude for the exceptionally warm welcome that the Indian people, the Indian government, and the administrative organs of the provinces we visited have given us everywhere. This grand welcome is proof of the genuine friendship of the Indian people towards the people of the Soviet Union. We assure our Indian friends that we, the Soviet people, also hold the same warm feelings for the great Indian people. We take this opportunity to convey the heartfelt and fraternal respect of the people of the Soviet Union to all the people of India.

We hope that the friendship and cooperation between our two countries will be strengthened and expanded day by day for the prosperity of our two peoples and for world peace.

When summing up the gains of our visit and our impressions of this visit, I would like to talk about two other issues, which are two issues that the Indian people feel very excited about for reasons that seem obvious to us. We are referring to the issue of Goa, Indian territory illegally occupied by Portugal, and the so-called Kashmir issue.

In the talks we held during our visit, we have explained the Soviet Union's attitude towards these two issues. The Soviet Union takes a firm stand in advocating the eradication of the remnants of the corrupt colonial system. The Soviet Union believes that the people living on these lands, which have been illegally occupied and brutally exploited by colonialists for many years, must be allowed to decide their own destiny.

Everyone knows that Goa is part of Indian territory. At the same time, everyone knows that it is inconceivable for the residents living in this territory, who have an indivisible blood relationship with their motherland, to live in isolation from India. Whether the colonialists like it or not, we are sure that this issue will be resolved in favor of the Indian people. The colonialists will have to get out of the land that is not their own.

Regarding Kashmir, we saw during our visit there how happily the people of Kashmir welcomed their national liberation and considered their territory an inseparable part of the Republic of India. We are convinced that the people of Kashmir will complete the work of adjusting their internal affairs without any external interference. This issue will be resolved according to the will of the people of Kashmir themselves.

We believe that this statement of ours can answer the many questions we have received from reporters yesterday and today. There are quite a few such questions. They can be summarized into several categories.

First, many of you are concerned about some specific issues regarding Soviet-Indian economic cooperation. You asked us about the possibilities of such cooperation, what aspects it will include, and so on. Regarding this issue, we can say that we are conducting appropriate negotiations with the Indian government. You can learn about the initial results of these negotiations from the joint communiqué on Indian and Soviet economic relations signed yesterday. It can also be said with certainty that there is a good foundation for developing the economic relations between our two countries on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit.

Second, many non-Indian journalists expressed such doubts: the Soviet Union may use India's refusal to conduct transactional cooperation with the United States and other Western countries as a condition for strengthening and developing friendship with India. Only those who are intent on sowing seeds of distrust between India and the Soviet Union would portray things this way. We have said it before, and we will say it again: we advocate peaceful cooperation and maintaining friendly relations with all countries—including the United States, Britain, and France. The concern that the friendship between India and the Soviet Union may harm the relationship between India or the Soviet Union and other countries, which is obviously fabricated, is worthless.

Third, many journalists raised questions about the future prospects of international relations. Some journalists feel uneasy about the following situation: some people (you know what kind of people they are) insist that the "Geneva spirit" is dead, the time for a large-scale restoration of the "Cold War" has arrived, and so on.

You yourselves see that in our visits to India and Burma and our upcoming visit to Afghanistan, some people are trying to revive the "Cold War." Some of your indiscriminate colleagues casually write about our speeches, distorting everything we say, regardless of what we say. However, we Soviets are not people who get excited easily. Abuse is useless. We don't care about this kind of platitude. As the saying goes, "Slander cannot tarnish a good reputation."

As for the essence of this issue, we believe that the "Geneva spirit" generated by the effective talks between the heads of the four major powers in Geneva this summer has played a good role, and this spirit cannot be buried. We advocate continuing and strengthening international cooperation, and advocate peaceful coexistence between countries. If the recent Geneva four-nation foreign ministers' conference did not achieve the results that the people of the world expected, then, as we said, it is obviously only because the time is not yet ripe. This also proves that some countries have not abandoned the long-condemned policy of "position of strength." It must be firmly pointed out that as long as someone relies on this policy of position of strength, negotiations will not achieve any results.

In any case, you know that the Soviet Union has put forward many urgent and feasible proposals on issues such as collective security, disarmament and banning of atomic weapons, and expanding international contacts at the Geneva conference. If no agreement has been reached so far, it is not our fault. We will continue to spare no effort to continue to fight for the resolution of these important issues in the future.

In this regard, many journalists also raised such a question: Is the time ripe to convene another summit meeting of major powers of the Geneva Conference type to discuss the most important Far East issues? We believe that this proposition is worth supporting. Naturally, such a meeting can only produce positive results under the condition that all participants in the meeting should abandon the infamous policy of "position of strength" and then discuss the issues. Needless to say, the People's Republic of China and India should participate in such a meeting.

Everyone asked us many questions about the issue of disarmament. We believe that it is not necessary to elaborate on our attitude towards this issue any further. You are all very clear about this issue. The Soviet Union's proposal on the issue of disarmament put forward in the United Nations this year opened the way for a rapid and effective resolution of the disarmament issue. If the United States had not suddenly changed its attitude and suddenly abandoned its own original proposal, then perhaps these issues would have been close to being resolved.

Some journalists raised such a question: Will the Soviet Union agree to unilaterally reduce armaments in order to set an example for its Western counterparts?

We believe that you must also agree that it is not serious to raise questions in this way.

How could the Soviet Union implement unilateral disarmament when the other party in our negotiations not only did not express willingness to reduce armed forces, but was shouting to further expand its armaments? Under such conditions, it would be foolish for us to implement unilateral disarmament, which would be harmful not only to the Soviet Union, but also to all peace-loving people.

We advocate disarmament under such a clear and unchangeable condition, that is, our counterpart also agrees to disarm with us. We advocate banning atomic and hydrogen weapons, but we also want the other party to be willing to do so with us. We advocate establishing strict international supervision over the implementation of these measures, but we must take a realistic attitude towards the resolution of this issue.

The fourth category of questions concerns the Soviet Union's internal affairs. We welcome Indian public opinion's interest in our country's life. Therefore, we also welcome Indian newspapers to send resident reporters to Moscow, which several of you have raised this question. Some people say that there are still some technical problems in sending resident reporters from India to the Soviet Union, but we believe that these problems are not difficult to solve.

Judging from the questions we have received, here and in many other countries, there is still a lack of objective news about our country's life, about the characteristics of our economic, social and political system.

Some people raised such a question: Why is there only one political party in the Soviet Union? To raise questions in this way is obviously due to insufficient understanding of the foundations of our socialist society.

As everyone knows, the multitude of parties is a phenomenon peculiar to class-based bourgeois countries, because political parties reflect and safeguard the interests of the corresponding classes, so each class naturally has its own political party. In the Soviet Union, a completely new socialist society has been established due to the victory of socialism. In this society, there are no hostile classes, no groups with conflicting and contradictory interests.

Our current society is a single society, and the strength of this society lies in its unity and solidarity.

In pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia, there were many political parties.

There were capitalists' parties, landowners' parties, rich peasants' parties that portrayed themselves as social revolutionary parties, and also the working-class party founded by the great Lenin, that is, the Bolshevik Party. This party successfully mobilized the working class to oppose the capitalists and landlords and oppose the Tsarist system. It successfully guaranteed the alliance between the working class and the peasants. It successfully attracted the advanced strata of the intellectuals to the side of the working class, completed the great October Socialist Revolution under its leadership, smashed and eliminated the exploiting classes, and built a new socialist society. The Soviet people are now successfully building a communist society.

Now, if there were capitalist and landlord parties in the Soviet Union, who could they represent? There are no capitalists and landlords there, which means that the question of having such parties is meaningless. Now, if there were rich peasant parties in our country, who could they represent? We have established a collective farm system and permanently eliminated the old economic system in rural areas, which produces capitalism every day and every hour. Now, the youth of our country only know about rich peasants from books and stories told by the older generation.

Soviet society is a society of working people—workers, peasants, and working intellectuals. The Communist Party, as stated in the Soviet Constitution, is the vanguard of the working people in the struggle to build a communist society, and is the leading force of all social organizations and state organs of the working people.

This is our society, our system. We do not impose our system on anyone, but we frankly say that we think this is the best system. Some people try to describe things in this way: the development of communist ideas around the world is some kind of conspiracy by the Soviet Union. However, as everyone knows, communism already existed in Europe long before the Great October Revolution, and the communist doctrine founded by Marx and Engels had already taken root among the masses of working people.

Here, we would also like to talk about the question of the Communist Information Bureau, or what some people often call "Cominform," which some journalists have raised with us.

Participating in this organization are the Communist Parties of several European countries. Its purpose is to exchange information and experience in the workers' class's struggle for liberation. The activities of this organization make all those who hope to forever maintain the corrupt and outdated system of exploiting people uneasy.

Sometimes the question is raised: Can the Communist Information Bureau be abolished to some extent? But, strictly speaking, what reason is there for the Communist Parties to abandon this universally recognized form of international exchange and cooperation? For example, why do those who raise the question of abolishing the Communist Information Bureau not express any opposition to the activities of the Socialist International, a joint organization of social democratic parties in various countries? Why do they think that it is natural and reasonable for capitalists to form international monopoly capital alliances, meet regularly, and handle their affairs together, but want to prevent the workers' class from realizing the great slogan of international unity announced long ago by Marx and Engels, which conforms to the vital interests of all working people - "Workers of all countries, unite!"

We have always been, and will continue to be, in favor of strengthening and developing the international cooperation of the workers' class, which is aimed at safeguarding the vital interests of all working people and fighting for the cause of peace.

The Communist Party, which safeguards the interests of the workers' class and all working people, believes in the most advanced and noble Marxist-Leninist doctrine. This doctrine has been brilliantly proven to be correct in the practice of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries.

This doctrine is gaining increasing universal dissemination everywhere in the world. As Lenin said, we are opposed to "exporting revolution" because to raise questions in this way violates science. Progressive ideas will inevitably pave the way for themselves and will inevitably defeat outdated ideas. This is how the development of human society has been in the past and will be in the future.

This is our opinion on the questions you have raised.

Finally, please allow me to express my gratitude for your concern.

Goodbye!

At the end of the press conference, Khrushchev thanked the Indian journalists for the objective and correct reports they had made on Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to India, and pointed out that this objective reporting helped to consolidate the friendly relations between India and the Soviet Union.

    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫离印度前招待记者
    布尔加宁在招待会上发表声明
    新华社新德里十四日讯　苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在离开印度前十二月十四日在德里为印度、苏联和外国记者举行了一次记者招待会。参加招待会的有代表印度、苏联和外国各大通讯社和报纸的一百五十多名记者。
    布尔加宁发表了如下的声明：
    我们应印度政府的邀请到印度来作了一次友好访问。我们对印度的访问和今年六月间尼赫鲁先生对苏联的友好访问，对进一步改善我们两国间的友好关系和巩固世界和平都是非常重要的。
    你们都已经知道昨天签字的苏联和印度的联合声明，这个声明表明了苏联和印度的政治家们对我们两国关系中的最重要的问题以及对重大的国际问题的见解。这个声明对于进一步增进苏联和印度间的友好关系是非常重要的。它也具有很大的国际意义。
    我们在印度停留期间访问了许多城市和省邦，参观了巨大的建设工程和在孟买、加尔各答、班加罗尔、马德拉斯的工厂。我们访问了农业发展中心，参观了一些印度科学机关。我们瞻仰了一些古代建筑的伟大遗迹。我们知道了一些关于多民族的印度人民的生活和工作的情况，关于他们在独立的年代中所取得的成就，我们对于印度的丰富的天然资源和巨大的潜在能力也有了一个概念。给予我们印象最大、最不可磨灭的是伟大的印度人民，他们的活泼的儿童和青年，他们的才能和勤劳，他们爱好和平和同所有国家友好合作的不屈不挠的意志。我们到处都受到印度人民的热诚款待，这种热诚款待证明他们对苏联各族人民的深刻同情和友好。
    印度人民为发展国民经济而作的努力，尤其是为发展工业所作的努力也给了我们很深刻的印象，而工业是经济进步的支柱，是任何国家的独立的主要的不可缺少的条件。德莫打流域和巴克拉—南加尔的发展，设计中的钢铁企业和新五年计划的准备，无疑都是印度政府在发展国家经济方面的重要措施。
    印度拥有成功地发展它的国民经济的一切必要的东西：巨大的天然资源，广阔肥沃的土地，而且，最重要的是，在自己许多世纪的历史中创造了不朽的文化古迹的智慧勤劳的印度人民无穷无尽的创造力量。我们苏联人民凭我们在计划国民经济方面的经验而有这样的印象：印度由于目前为发展本国经济和充分利用本国物质资源和人力而进行的努力，将能够在比较短的时间内大大增加农业和工业的产量，从而大大增进人民的福利。
    我们两国之间已经建立起来的友好关系为我们两国在经济、科学和文化方面的紧密合作提供了有利的机会。我们已经说过，苏联愿意在互利的基础上提供它在科学和技术方面的经验，提供它在计划经济以及建设工业企业和水电工程方面的经验。它也将很乐意向印度人民学习经济、科学和文化的各方面的经验。我们相信，扩大印度和苏联之间的文化联系将有助于进一步加强我们两国之间的友好关系。
    我们高兴地指出，由于我们在印度的访问和我们同尼赫鲁先生以及印度其他领袖们所举行的会谈，已经就关于进一步扩大苏联和印度之间的经济合作的一些重要问题达成了协议。
    我们这次在印度停留期间所看见的事情使我们相信：印度人民正在热情地为和平而努力，而且愿意为维护和巩固和平而坚决地进行斗争。印度在解决国际问题和建立各国之间的友好关系方面正在发挥愈来愈重要的作用。在亚洲，而且不仅在亚洲，现在没有任何重大问题可以在没有印度和中华人民共和国参加的情况下获得解决。在关于印度和中华人民共和国积极地、卓著成效地参加解决国际问题的工作的明显事例中间，可以举出它们在停止印度支那战争的工作中所发挥的作用，还可以举出它们积极参加万隆会议这一事实，万隆会议在缓和国际紧张局势和发展亚非国家之间的合作方面发挥了显著的作用。
    苏联和印度现在把、而且还将继续把它们之间的关系建立在著名的和平共处的五项原则上面，因为这五项原则是符合所有爱好和平的人民的利益、符合和平的利益的。这些原则完全符合苏联政府自从苏联立国以来一直奉行的外交政策。这些原则已经获得许许多多国家的赞同，并且构成万隆会议的各项决议的基础。如果包括美国、英国和法国在内的其他国家也赞同这些原则，那将是在进一步缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际间的必要的信任方面的一项重要步骤。至于苏联，它一向奉行、而且将继续奉行一种和平和尊重各国人民的自主权利的政策，一种互不侵犯、平等互利、不干涉其他国家的内政的政策，一种具有不同的社会制度和政治制度的国家实行和平共处的政策。这种政策是从一贯坚持不渝地奉行和平政策的苏维埃国家的本质产生的。
    大家知道，有许多极为迫切的远东问题仍待解决。具体说来，只有在日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的决议的基础上才能使印度支那问题获得完全的最后的解决。不能再迟迟不解决像给予中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位这种重要的问题，也不能再迟迟不在符合中国人民民族权利的情况下解决台湾和其他沿海岛屿的问题，这些岛屿是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。
    苏联政府一向反对在世界各地建立任何种类的军事集团和在外国领土上建立军事基地，因为组织这种集团和建立这种基地是对和平的一种严重威胁，在缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平的道路上造成了新的障碍。我们认为：只有通过以巩固和平为目的的共同的集体努力而不是通过建立军事集团，各国人民的真正安全才能得到保障。
    苏联政府提出关于欧洲集体安全体系的著名建议就是出于这些考虑。
    目前所进行的军备竞赛和继续不断地制造和储存原子武器和氢武器这种情况充满着对和平的威胁，并且给被军费开支压得喘不过气来的劳动人民加上了沉重的负担。我们知道，裁减军备、完全和无条件地禁止原子武器和氢武器是今天各国、首先是所有大国所面临的一项紧迫的任务。当然，只要在这个问题上还没有达成协议，苏联就必须继续努力加强自己的国防并且制造原子武器和氢武器。在目前的情况下没有别的办法。
    当我们离开印度这个好客的国家的时候，我们对于印度人民、印度政府和我们所访问过的各省的行政机关到处给予我们的异常热烈的欢迎表示深深的感谢。这种盛大的欢迎是印度人民对苏联各族人民的真正友谊的证明。我们向我们的印度朋友保证，我们苏联人民对于伟大的印度人民也怀有同样热烈的感情。我们利用这个机会向全体印度人民转达苏联各族人民的衷心的、兄弟般的敬意。
    我们希望：为了我们两国人民的繁荣，为了世界和平，我们两国的友谊和合作将日益加强和扩展。
    在总起来谈一谈我们这次访问的收获和我们对这次访问的印象的时候，我想谈一谈另外两个问题，这是两个由于在我们看来很明显的原因而使印度人民感到非常激动的问题。我们指的是被葡萄牙非法占领的印度领土果阿的问题和所谓克什米尔问题。
    在我们访问过程中发表的谈话中，我们已经说明苏联对这两个问题的态度。苏联采取主张肃清腐朽的殖民制度残余的坚定立场。苏联认为必须让居住在这些许多年来被殖民主义者非法占领和残酷榨取的土地上的人民，决定他们自己的命运。
    人人都知道果阿是印度领土的一部分。同时每一个人都知道，对居住在这块领土上的同自己的祖国有着不可分割的血统关系的居民来说，脱离印度而孤立地生存是一件不可思议的事情。不管殖民主义者是否喜欢，我们确信这个问题将会获得对印度人民有利的解决。殖民主义者将不得不从不是他们自己的领土的土地上滚出去。
    关于克什米尔，我们在访问那里的时候看到，克什米尔人民是多么高兴地欢迎他们的民族解放，并且认为他们的领土是印度共和国的不可分割的一部分。我们深信，克什米尔人民将会在不受外界任何干涉的情况下完成调整他们的内部事务的工作。这个问题将按照克什米尔人民自己的意志得到解决。
    我们相信，我们的这个声明可以答复我们在昨天和今天从记者那里接到的许多问题。这种问题相当多。它们可以归纳成几类。
    第一，你们中间许多人关心关于苏印经济合作的一些具体问题。你们向我们问到这种合作的可能性如何，它将包括哪些方面等等。关于这个问题，我们可以说我们正在同印度政府进行适当的谈判。你们可以从昨天签署的印度和苏联经济关系联合公报中知道这种谈判的初步结果。还可以肯定地这样说：在互相尊重和互利的条件下发展我们两国的经济关系是有着良好的基础的。
    第二，许多非印度籍记者表示了这样的疑虑：苏联可能以印度拒绝同美国和其他西方国家进行事务性的合作作为加强和发展同印度的友谊的条件。只有那些一心想在印度和苏联之间散布不信任的种子的人才会把事情说成这样。我们说过，现在再重说一遍：我们主张同一切国家——包括美国、英国和法国在内——和平合作和保持友好关系。关于印度和苏联的友谊可能损害印度或苏联同其他国家的关系的那种显然是制造出来的担心是不值一文的。
    第三，许多记者提出关于国际关系的今后的前景的问题。有些记者对以下的情况感到不安：某些方面的人（你们知道这是一些怎样的人）硬说，“日内瓦精神”已经死亡，大举恢复“冷战”的时候已经到来，以及诸如此类的话。
    你们自己看到，在我们对印度和缅甸的访问以及我们即将进行的对阿富汗的访问方面，某些人企图重新恢复“冷战”。你们的某些不分是非的同行就我们的讲话随便乱写，不论我们讲的是什么话，他们都一概加以歪曲。但是，我们苏联人并不是动不动就激动的人。谩骂是没有用的。我们对于这种滥调毫不在乎。俗语说得好：“诽谤玷污不了好名声。”
    至于这个问题的实质，我们认为：四大国首脑今年夏天在日内瓦举行的有效的会谈所产生的“日内瓦精神”起了良好的作用，这种精神是不可能埋葬的。我们主张继续和加强国际合作，主张各国之间和平共处。如果不久以前的日内瓦四国外交部长会议没有获得世界各国人民所期待的结果，那末，正如我们所说的，这显然只是因为时机还没有成熟。这也就证明了某些国家还没有放弃老早就已经被谴责的“实力地位”政策。必须坚决指出，只要有人以这种实力地位政策为依据，谈判就不会取得任何结果。
    无论如何，你们知道，苏联在日内瓦会议上就集体安全、裁减军备和禁止原子武器、扩大国际接触等问题提出了许多紧要的和可行的建议。如果目前还没有能够达成协议，那不是我们的过错。我们今后也还将绝不吝惜自己的努力，为解决这些重要的问题而继续斗争。
    在这方面，许多记者还提出这样一个问题：召开另一次日内瓦会议类型的大国首脑会议来讨论最重大的远东问题的时机是否已经成熟。我们认为，这种主张是值得支持的。自然，这种会议只有在这样条件下才能产生积极的结果，那就是会议的所有参加者应当抛弃臭名远扬的“实力地位”政策再来讨论问题。不用说，参加这种会议的应当有中华人民共和国和印度。
    大家向我们提出了有关裁军问题的许多问题。我们认为，没有必要再详细地阐明我们对这个问题的态度。你们对这个问题都很清楚。苏联今年在联合国中提出的关于裁军问题的建议为迅速有效地解决裁军问题开辟了道路。要不是美国突然改变态度，忽然抛弃它自己原先的建议，那末也许这些问题已经快要得到解决了。
    有些记者提出这样一个问题：苏联是否会同意单方面地裁减军备，以便为它的西方对方树立榜样。
    我们认为，你们一定也同意这样来提问题是不认真的。
    当我们谈判的对方不仅没有表示愿意裁减武装部队，反而在高喊要更加扩充自己的军备的时候，苏联怎么可能实行单方面的裁军呢？在这种条件下，我们实行单方面的裁军是愚蠢的，这不仅对苏联有害，对一切爱好和平的人民也是有害的。
    我们主张在这样一个明确而不可改变的条件下实行裁军，那就是，我们的对方也同意跟我们一道裁军。我们主张禁止原子武器和氢武器，但是要对方也愿意跟我们一道这样做，我们主张对这些措施的实现建立严格的国际监督，然而必须对这个问题的解决采取现实的态度。
    第四类问题涉及苏联的内政。我们欢迎印度舆论对我国的生活感到兴趣。因此我们也欢迎印度报纸派出常驻莫斯科的记者，你们之中有几位曾经提出这个问题。有些人说，印度要想派常驻记者到苏联去至今仍有一些技术问题，我们认为这些问题是不难解决的。
    从我们所收到的问题来看，这里和许多其他的国家一样，都还缺乏关于我国的生活，关于我国的经济、社会和政治制度的特点的客观消息。
    有些人提出这样一个问题：为什么在苏联只有一个政党。这样来提问题，显然是由于对我们社会主义社会的基础没有足够的了解。
    大家知道，党派众多是有阶级的资产阶级国家所特有的现象，因为政党反映和维护相应的阶级的利益，所以，每个阶级自然都有自己的政党。在苏联，由于社会主义获得胜利而建立了一个完全新的、社会主义的社会，在这个社会里没有敌对阶级，没有利益互相冲突和矛盾的集团。
    我们现在的社会是一个单一的社会，这个社会的强大在于它的统一和团结。
    在革命前的沙皇俄国，有过很多政党。
    有过资本家的政党，有过地主的政党，有过把自己渲染成为社会革命党的富农的政党，也有伟大的列宁所创立的工人阶级政党，即布尔什维克党。这个党成功地发动了工人阶级去反对资本家和地主、反对沙皇制度。它成功地保证了工人阶级同农民的联盟。它成功地把知识分子中的先进阶层吸引到工人阶级方面来，在它的领导下完成了伟大的十月社会主义革命，粉碎和消灭了剥削阶级，建成了一个新的、社会主义社会。苏联人民现在在成功地建设着共产主义社会。
    现在在苏联如果有资本家和地主的政党，它又能代表谁呢？我们那里没有资本家和地主，这就是说，有这种政党的问题是毫无意义的。现在我国如果有富农政党，它又能代表谁呢？我们建立了集体农庄制度，永远地消灭了农村中每天、每时每刻都产生着资本主义的旧的经济制度。现在，我国青年只是从书本中和老辈人讲的故事中才知道富农。
    苏维埃社会是劳动人民——工人、农民和劳动知识分子的社会。共产党，正如苏联宪法所写明的，是劳动人民在争取建设共产主义社会的斗争中的先锋队，是劳动人民的一切社会组织和国家机构的领导力量。
    我们的社会、我们的制度就是这样的。我们不把我们的制度强加给任何人，但是，我们坦率地说，我们认为这是最好的制度。有人企图把事情描述成这样：全世界共产主义思想的发展是苏联方面搞的某种阴谋。但是，大家知道，在伟大的十月革命之前很久，在欧洲早就已经有了共产主义，马克思和恩格斯所创立的共产主义学说已经在劳动人民群众中扎下了根子。
    这里，我们也想谈谈某些记者向我们提出的关于共产党情报局或者有人常常称为“康敏福姆”的这一个问题。
    参加这个组织的有欧洲若干国家的共产党，它的目的是交流工人阶级在争取解放的斗争中的情报和经验，这个组织的活动使所有那些希望把腐朽过时的人剥削人的制度永远保持下去的人惶惶不安。
    有时会提出这样的问题：是否可以在某种程度上取消共产党情报局？但是，严格地说来，有什么理由要共产党放弃这种大家所公认的国际交往和合作的形式呢？譬如，提出关于取消共产党情报局的问题的人为什么对各国社会民主党的联合组织社会党国际的活动没有表示任何反对意见呢？为什么他们认为，资本家结成国际垄断资本联合组织，定期会晤，共同办他们的事是自然的，合情合理的，而却想要不叫工人阶级实现早就由马克思和恩格斯宣布的符合全体劳动人民切身利益的关于国际团结的伟大口号——“全世界无产者，联合起来！”
    我们向来是，并且今后仍旧是主张加强和发展目的在于保卫全体劳动人民的切身利益和为和平事业而斗争的工人阶级国际合作的。
    保卫着工人阶级和全体劳动人民的利益的共产党，信仰最先进和崇高的马克思—列宁主义学说。这种学说在苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的实践中光辉地被证实是正确的。
    这个学说在全世界各处得到日益普遍的传播。正如列宁说过的，我们反对“输出革命”，因为这样提问题是违反科学的。进步的思想必然会为它自己开辟出道路，而且必然会战胜陈旧过时的思想。人类社会的发展过去是这样，将来也是这样。
    这就是我们对你们提出的问题所表示的意见。
    最后，请允许我对你们的关心表示感谢。
    再见！
