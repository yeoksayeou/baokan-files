    Should Not Be Limited to "Circulars" and "Self-Criticism"
    Lin Li
    A few days ago, the CCP Guangdong Yuezhong District Committee issued a "Circular on Forest Fires and Strengthening Forest Protection and Fire Prevention Work." The circular stated: Since the beginning of autumn, forest fires have been occurring continuously in the mountain areas of Yuezhong District, Guangdong Province, causing serious losses to state property. For example, since September, 183 fires of varying sizes have occurred in eighteen counties including Zengcheng alone. The affected area totaled 20,680 mu. 371,880 pine trees, 160,634 fir trees, 127,300 bamboo trees, and 106,334 other trees were burned. While these valuable properties turned to ashes, 21 farmers were injured and 5 died. In addition, the losses from a major fire that burned for five days and five nights in Lanke Mountain, Gaoyao County, in early November, and the losses in Fanjia Tian, Boluo County, which burned an area five li wide and more than ten li long on the evening of November 8, were not included in the statistics.
    Judging from the figures listed in the circular, the losses from forest fires are enormous, causing great distress. Just think, how much labor and how many years did it take to grow these hundreds of thousands of trees!
    What is strange is that the District Committee's circular hardly mentions how to deal with such huge losses. Why is it not mentioned? Are these fires impossible to prevent by human effort? That is not the case.
    According to forestry data, forest fire incidents in the Yuezhong area have been appalling in recent years. In the winter of last year and the spring of this year alone, more than 970,000 mu of forests were burned, and the number of trees lost exceeded the total number of trees that survived from afforestation in the past five years. And these fires were not impossible to prevent by human effort. As can also be seen from the circular, almost all fires were caused by human actions. Among the rural workers in the Yuezhong area, there is a very wrong argument. They say that fire prevention and forest protection hinder agricultural production; to carry out the manure accumulation campaign and develop agricultural production, one has to go up the mountains to burn grass. According to the circular, fire incidents caused by county and district workers' connivance and encouragement, and by village workers' and young activists' "leading the way" to burn grass, accounted for 80 percent of the fires that occurred last winter and this spring, and 60 percent since September. Some fires were deliberately set by reactionary landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. Since the fire incidents are man-made, they can be prevented and should be dealt with.
    Prior to this circular, the Yuezhong District Committee and the Yuezhong Administrative Office had issued a "Joint Directive." That directive stipulated: "Personnel of all levels of agencies and revolutionary cadres who fail to rescue fires and neglect their duties must be seriously investigated and held accountable, and given appropriate punishment according to the severity of the circumstances." In the 183 fire cases since September, there were indeed many people who "failed to rescue fires" and neglected their duties. In Siyue Township, Yunfu County, a demobilized soldier named Zhong Rongsen went up the mountain with his wife to burn fertilizer. After lighting the fire, he hid aside to sleep until a fire broke out. When the forest workers blew whistles and called for help, he still lazily slept and did not move. The forest personnel ran to the township People's Committee to ask the township head to mobilize the masses to fight the fire, but the township head turned a deaf ear. As a result, the raging fire spread in all directions with the wind, burning more than 3,000 mu of forest. The township did not report this mountain fire incident to the district, and the district did not report it to the county. After the forest farm reported it to the Yuezhong Administrative Office, Yunfu County still did not investigate and deal with it after repeated urging. When a mountain fire and death incident occurred in Zengcheng County, they claimed to have sent someone to investigate and deal with it long ago, when in fact no one had been sent to investigate and deal with it at all.
    According to people familiar with the situation in Guangdong, every time a forest fire occurs, the Party and government organs always issue a circular and conduct a self-criticism, but rarely see effective handling. In order to effectively prevent fires and protect forests, and to protect state property, the Yuezhong District Committee should seriously investigate and affix responsibility for the mountain fire incidents that have occurred since September, and deal with them seriously. Do not just issue a "circular" and conduct a "self-criticism" as in the past and consider the matter closed.

    不应该仅限于“通报”和“检讨”
    林里
    头几天，中共广东省粤中区党委发出了一件关于“火烧山林及加强护林防火工作的通报”。这个通报中说：入秋以来，粤中地区的山林地带，不断发生火烧山林事件，致使国家财产遭到严重损失。如从九月算起，单在增城等十八个县内，就发生大小火灾一百八十三宗。受灾面积二万零六百八十亩。烧毁松树三十七万一千八百八十株、杉树十六万零六百三十四株、竹子十二万七千三百株、其他树木十万六千三百三十四株。在这些宝贵财产变成灰烬的同时，还烧伤农民二十一人，死五人。此外，高要县兰柯山十一月上旬烧了五天五夜的一场大火的损失，博罗县范家田地方，在十一月八日晚间烧了横宽五里、长达十多里地的损失，都没有统计在内。
    就通报所列举的数字来看，火烧山林的损失非常巨大，叫人万分痛心。想一想，花了多少人的劳动，费了多少年的时间，才长好了这几十万株树木呵！
    令人奇怪的是，区党委的通报中，对于这样巨大的损失问题如何处理，却几乎没有提到。为什么没有提到呢？这些火灾的发生是人力所不能防止的吗？事实不是这样。
    据林业资料记载，这几年内，粤中地区的火烧山林事件非常惊人。仅在去年冬天和今年春天，就烧毁山林九十七万多亩，树木损失数量，超过了近五年来的造林成活总数。而这些火灾的发生，并不是人力所不能防止的。从通报上也可以看出，火灾几乎全是人为的。在粤中地区的农村工作人员中，有一种非常错误的论调。他们说：防火护林妨害农业生产；要开展积肥运动，要发展农业生产，就不能不上山烧草。据通报说，因为县区工作人员的纵容和鼓励，因为乡村工作人员和青年积极分子的“带头”而上山烧草所造成的火灾事件，占去冬今春所发生的火灾事件的百分之八十，九月以来占百分之六十。还有一些火灾，是反动地主、富农，反革命分子故意制造的。火灾事件既然是人为的，那末就是可以防止的，也是应该加以处理的。
    在这个通报以前，粤中区党委和粤中行署，曾经发过一个“联合指示”。那个指示中规定：“各级机关人员、革命干部，见火不救，有失职守的，必须认真追查责任，分别情节轻重，给予应得处分。”在九月以来的一百八十三宗火灾案件中，“见火不救”和玩忽职守的人实在不少。云浮县思约乡，有一个复员军人叫钟荣森，他带着他的老婆上山烧肥，点着火后就躲到一边去睡觉，直到引起火灾，林场工人吹哨子呼救的时候，他还懒洋洋地睡着不动。林场人员跑到乡人民委员会，叫乡长动员群众去救火，乡长竟置若罔闻。结果，烈火顺风四处燃烧，烧了三千多亩山林。对于这次烧山事件，乡不报区，区不报县。经林场报到粤中行署后，连催两次，云浮县仍不调查处理。增城县发生了烧山死人事件，明明没有派人调查处理，竟说早已派人前去调查处理。
    据熟悉广东情况的人们谈，每次发生山林失火事件以后，党政机关总是通报一番，检讨一顿，但是很少见过有效处理。为了切实防火护林，为了保护国家的财产，粤中区党委对于九月以来发生的烧山事件，应该认真追究责任，严肃处理。不要再像以往那样仅仅是“通报”和“检讨”一番就算完事。
