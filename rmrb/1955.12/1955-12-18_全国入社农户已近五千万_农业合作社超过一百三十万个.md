Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: According to incomplete statistics as of the end of November, there are already more than 1,397,000 new and old agricultural producers' cooperatives nationwide, with an additional 168,000 cooperatives nearing completion. The number of farm households participating in cooperatives has reached over 49.4 million, accounting for more than 40% of the total number of farm households nationwide. Judging from the current situation, as long as local leading organs continue to strengthen leadership and further criticize conservative thinking and complacency, it is estimated that the basically realization of agricultural cooperation of a semi-socialist nature can be achieved nationwide by next autumn.

Since November, the number of newly established cooperatives in all provinces and autonomous regions nationwide has, without exception, repeatedly exceeded the original plans. In North China and Northeast China, most provinces have basically achieved agricultural cooperation of a semi-socialist nature, and a small number of provinces are also about to basically achieve cooperation of a semi-socialist nature. In Hebei, Shanxi, and Heilongjiang provinces, the number of farm households joining cooperatives has reached 70% to 80% of the total number of farm households in the provinces, basically achieving agricultural cooperation. In Liaoning and Jilin provinces, the number of farm households joining cooperatives has reached over 60% to 66% of the total number of farm households in the provinces, and agricultural cooperation can be basically achieved before the end of this year and January next year. In the provinces of East China and Central South China, and some provinces in Southwest China, the characteristic of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives during this period is that it is fast, numerous, and of good quality. In Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Guangxi and other provinces, the number of farm households joining cooperatives has accounted for about half of the total number of farm households in the provinces. In Anhui Province, by the end of November, the proportion of farm households joining cooperatives to the total number of farm households had increased from 15.6% in March of this year to 54%, and many counties had developed to account for more than 60% to 70% of the total number of farm households. The work of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives in Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces has also been relatively fast. In order to meet the requirements of the broad masses of farmers to join cooperatives, some provinces have revised their plans for developing agricultural producers' cooperatives again and again, adding to them again and again. In remote areas, the number of farmers in agricultural areas of Qinghai Province participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives has reached 51% of the total number of farm households. The cooperative movement in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is also developing on a large scale.

At present, in rural areas, not only poor and lower-middle peasants are resolutely taking the socialist road and actively demanding to join cooperatives and establish cooperatives, but also upper-middle peasants have begun to tend towards cooperation. According to preliminary investigations, in the provinces that have basically achieved cooperation, the number of upper-middle peasants joining cooperatives is already considerable. In Heilongjiang Province, upper-middle peasants joining cooperatives generally account for 50% to 70% of the total number of households in this class. In provinces where the number of farm households joining cooperatives has reached half of the total number of farm households, about 20% of the upper-middle peasants have also joined cooperatives. Among these upper-middle peasants, the vast majority have personally experienced that the direction of agricultural producers' cooperatives is good, production is high, income is high, and it is stronger than individual farming, so they sincerely and genuinely demand to join cooperatives; a part of them demand to join cooperatives under the promotion of family children (Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, cadres, soldiers, and workers). Party committees at all levels have correctly and completely implemented the Party's class line in the movement, actively led the movement forward, and have always paid attention to establishing the leadership advantage of the poor peasants in new and old cooperatives.

With the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, a production upsurge has generally appeared in rural areas. After a large number of new cooperatives were established and old cooperatives expanded, the members' production enthusiasm was very high, actively investing in the cooperatives, purchasing new-style farm tools, horses, and vehicles, and extensively carrying out activities of accumulating fertilizer and building small-scale water conservancy projects. In Hebei Province, 13,470 double-wheeled double-shared plows were sold in one week in September, a sales volume equal to the total sales volume in the past nine months. In Shouguang, Yidu, Linzi and other four counties in Shandong Province, 640 double-wheeled double-shared plows and 703 walking plows were sold in ten days in November, but still could not meet the needs of farmers. The Lingyuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Rehe Province recently purchased sixty horses from Heilongjiang Province, which were sold out by farmers in one day. In Pingjiang, Xiangtan, Ningxiang, Wangcheng and other eight counties (cities) in Hunan Province, more than 1,800 cooperatives have raised 220,000 yuan in production funds, and more than 630 cooperatives have purchased 1,100 head of cattle. Fertilizer accumulation activities are also very common in various places. In Xingtai Prefecture, Hebei Province alone, agricultural producers' cooperatives in nine counties have accumulated more than 1.84 billion catties of fertilizer, more than double the amount in the same period of previous years. Now, with the help of old cooperatives, new cooperatives in various places are studying the draft model charter of agricultural producers' cooperatives, formulating their own cooperative charters, long-term development plans, and production plans for next year. Many cooperatives have already formulated production plans for this winter and next spring, and have begun to prepare for winter production and increased production next year.

    全国入社农户已近五千万
    农业合作社超过一百三十万个
    新华社十七日讯　截至十一月底的不完全统计，全国已经有了新老农业生产合作社一百三十九万七千多个，还有十六万八千多个社即将建成。全国入社农户已经达到四千九百四十多万户，占全国农户总数的百分之四十以上。从当前的情况来看，只要各地领导机关继续加强领导，进一步批判保守思想和自满情绪，预计明年秋天就可以在全国范围内基本上实现半社会主义性质的农业合作化。
    十一月份以来，全国各省、自治区新建社的数量都无例外地一再突破了原有的规划。华北和东北地区，大部分省已经基本上实现了半社会主义性质的农业合作化，小部分省也即将基本上实现半社会主义性质的合作化。河北、山西、黑龙江三省，入社农户已经达到全省农户总数的百分之七十到八十，基本上实现了农业合作化。辽宁、吉林两省入社农户已经达到全省农户总数的百分之六十到六十六以上，今年年底和明年一月以前可以基本上实现农业合作化。华东、中南地区的省份和西南地区的一些省份，这一段时期发展农业生产合作社的特点是既快、又多、又好。山东、江苏、安徽、浙江、福建、河南、湖北、广西等省，入社农户已经占全省农户总数一半左右。安徽省到十一月底，入社农户占农户总数的比例已经由今年三月份的百分之十五点六增加到百分之五十四，许多县已经发展到占农户总数的百分之六十到七十以上。湖南、江西、广东、四川、云南、贵州、陕西、甘肃等省发展农业生产合作社的工作也比较快。为满足广大农民的入社要求，有些省发展农业生产合作社的计划改了又改，加了又加。在边远地区，青海省农业区参加农业生产合作社的农户已经达到农户总数的百分之五十一。内蒙古自治区和新疆维吾尔自治区的合作化运动也正在大规模地发展。
    目前在农村中，不仅贫农和下中农坚决走社会主义道路，积极要求入社办社，而且上中农也开始倾向合作化。据初步调查，已经基本上实现合作化的省份，入社的上中农数量已经不少。黑龙江省入社的上中农一般占这个阶层总户数的百分之五十到七十。入社农户已经占到农户总数一半的省份，也约有百分之二十左右的上中农入社。这些上中农里面，绝大部分是亲身体验到农业生产合作社方向好、生产高、收入多、比单干强，因而真心真意要求入社的；一部分是在家庭子女（共产党员、青年团员、干部、战士、工人）推动下要求入社的。各级党委在运动中正确地完整地贯彻执行了党的阶级路线，积极领导运动前进，并且始终注意在新社和老社中树立以贫农为首的领导优势。
    随着农业合作化运动高潮而来的，是农村中普遍出现了生产热潮。大批新社建立和老社扩大以后，社员们生产情绪很高，积极向社内投资，购买新式农具、马匹、车辆，并且广泛地开展积肥和兴修小型水利的活动。河北省九月间在一周内销售了一万三千四百七十部双轮双铧犁，这个销售数量等于过去九个月的销售总量。山东省寿光、益都、临淄等四县，十一月间在十天内销售了六百四十部双轮双铧犁和七百零三部步犁，但是还不能满足农民的要求。热河省凌源县供销合作社最近从黑龙江省购买来的六十匹马，一天之内就被农民买光了。湖南省平江、湘潭、宁乡、望城等八县（市），已经有一千八百多个社筹集了二十二万元生产资金，有六百三十多个社买了一千一百头耕牛。各地积肥活动也非常普遍。仅河北省邢台专区九个县的农业生产合作社就已经积肥十八亿四千多斤，比往年同期增加了一倍多。现在，在老社的帮助下，各地新社正在学习农业生产合作社示范章程草案，制定本社社章、长期发展规划和明年的生产计划。有许多社已经订出了今冬明春的生产计划，开始进行冬季生产和明年增产的准备工作。
