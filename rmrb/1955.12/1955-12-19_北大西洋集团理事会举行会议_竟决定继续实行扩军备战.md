Xinhua News Agency, Paris dispatch: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Council meeting of foreign, defense, and finance ministers from fifteen countries was held in Paris on the 15th and 16th. The meeting decided to continue to intensify the implementation of military expansion and war preparation plans.

The communique issued after the meeting repeated stale anti-Soviet clichés, insisting that the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy and the growth of Soviet power constituted a "new challenge to the free world," attempting to use this argument to create a basis for the aggressive group's policy of military expansion and war preparations.

The communique stated that the meeting approved the goals of military expansion for the NATO countries for the three years beginning in 1956 and expressed the intention to give this military expansion plan "new impetus." According to Paris newspapers, the meeting decided to maintain military spending by NATO member states at a very high level. The meeting also stated that it would equip NATO's armed forces with "the most modern weapons," which, as NATO Secretary-General Ismay pointed out on the eve of the meeting, meant focusing on establishing equipment with "nuclear weapons." To promote military expansion in Western European countries, U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson assured the meeting that the United States would continue to provide substantial military assistance and indicated that it would increase the latest weapons, including guided missiles, in the military equipment allocated to Western Europe.

The meeting also decided to reorganize and strengthen the "coordination of air defense" in European countries of NATO. According to this decision, the air defense command of NATO member states will be transferred from the authority of the countries to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). This decision is, in effect, another serious infringement on the sovereignty of the countries participating in NATO. The air defense of these countries will thus be placed under the control of American generals. Because the new air defense "liaison system" will not only be built with the help of U.S. funding, but, as NATO Commander-in-Chief Gruenther said, the new system will be based "on new technical discoveries in the field of American radio."

The NATO Council also discussed the issue of West German armament. In this regard, it was pointed out that this meeting laid the foundation for West Germany to establish armed forces virtually without supervision. It is known that France had attempted to protest West German armaments exceeding the limits stipulated in the "Paris Agreements," but this protest was ignored.

### 北大西洋集团理事会举行会议  竟决定继续实行扩军备战

    北大西洋集团理事会举行会议
    竟决定继续实行扩军备战
    据新华社讯  巴黎消息：北大西洋集团十五国外交、国防和财政部长理事会会议于十五日和十六日在巴黎举行。会议决定继续加紧实行扩军备战计划。
    会后发表的公报重复陈腐的反苏滥调，硬说苏联所奉行的和平外交政策以及苏联力量的增长构成了“对自由世界的新挑战”，企图用这种说法为这个侵略集团的扩军备战政策制造根据。
    公报说，会议批准了从一九五六年起三年中北大西洋集团国家扩军的目标，并且表示要给这种扩军计划以“新的推动力”。据巴黎报纸报道，会议决定把北大西洋公约组织各成员国的军事开支保持在一个很高的水平上。会议并且表示要用“最新式的武器”装备北大西洋集团的武装部队，这就是北大西洋公约组织秘书长伊斯迈在会议前夕所指出的，要着重建立“核子武器”装备。为了推动西欧各国的扩军工作，美国国防部长威尔逊在会议上保证美国要继续提供大量军事援助，并且表示要在分配给西欧的军事装备中增加包括定向飞弹在内的最新武器。
    会议还决定改组和加强北大西洋公约组织欧洲国家的“防空的配合”。根据这个决定，北大西洋公约组织各成员国的防空指挥权将从各国的权限里划出来，交给北大西洋军事集团的统帅部。这个决定实际上是对参加北大西洋公约组织各国主权的又一次严重的侵犯。这些国家的空防将因此而被置于美国将军的控制之下。因为新的防空“联络体系”不但要由美国出钱帮助建立，而且正像北大西洋集团军总司令格仑瑟所说的，新的制度将建立“在美国的无线电方面新技术发现”的基础上。
    北大西洋公约组织理事会还讨论了西德的武装问题。在这方面，人们指出，这次会议奠定了让西德实际上不受监督地建立武装部队的基础。大家知道，法国曾经企图抗议西德的军备超过“巴黎协定”所规定的限度，但是，这个抗议并没有受到注意。
