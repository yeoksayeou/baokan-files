    A Workshop Producing Eggshell Powder
    Jinhua
    On Tangshan Road in Shanghai, there is a workshop specializing in the production of livestock feed – eggshell powder. This is the Tangshan Road by-product processing workshop of the Chicken and Duck Processing Factory of the Shanghai Supply Station of the China Food Company.
    Eggshell powder is a good feed for livestock. It contains 93.7% calcium carbonate and 4.15% organic matter, including a considerable amount of protein and other components. Feeding it to livestock, especially young piglets and hens and ducks, can help young piglets develop strong bones and enhance disease resistance factors; for hens and ducks, it can promote the hardening of soft-shelled eggs and increase egg production. In addition, it can also be used as fertilizer for farmland and industrial raw materials.
    Using eggshell powder as feed can save grain and accelerate livestock development, and it is also cheaper than general feed. Therefore, it is very popular among buyers. Since eggshell powder officially began production at the end of July this year, to mid-November, there were 18 purchasing units, including supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces; cooperative societies in the suburbs of Shanghai and the First and Second Livestock Farms of the Shanghai Agricultural Bureau, as well as the Shanghai Local State-Owned Milk Company, etc. The Shanghai Suburban Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone purchased 62,000 jin in November.
    Eggshells have always been discarded waste. The China Food Company Shanghai Supply Station's affiliated Chicken and Duck Processing Factory, as well as the joint state-private Maocheng Egg Industry Refrigeration Company's Egg Product Manufacturing Factory, discarded more than 4 million jin of eggshells in the past year alone from processing egg products. Now, using eggshells to make feed, with the current average powder yield of eggshells at 80%, more than 3 million jin of grain can be saved each year.
    Now, this workshop has installed a new machine and is preparing to increase the production of eggshell powder.

    一个生产蛋壳粉的车间
    金华
    在上海唐山路上，有一个专门生产牲畜饲料——蛋壳粉的车间，这便是中国食品公司上海供应站鸡鸭加工厂唐山路副产品加工车间。
    蛋壳粉，是喂养牲畜的好饲料。它含有百分之九十三点七的碳酸钙和百分之四点一五的有机物，其中还占有不少的蛋白质等成分。用来喂养牲畜，特别是喂养幼小的生猪和母鸡母鸭，可以帮助幼小生猪骨骼发达和增强抗疫因素；对母鸡母鸭，则可以促使软壳蛋硬化，增加产蛋量。此外，它还可以作为农田肥料和工业原料。
    用蛋壳粉作饲料，既能节约粮食，又能加速牲畜的发育，而且，价格也比一般饲料便宜，因此很受广大购买者的欢迎。从今年七月底蛋壳粉开始正式生产以来，到十一月中旬，购买单位就有十八个，其中包括有浙江、江苏两省地区的供销合作社和农业生产合作社；上海市郊区合作社和上海市农业局第一、第二牧场，以及上海市地方国营牛奶公司等。仅上海市郊区供销合作社一个单位，在十一月份就购买了六万二千斤。
    蛋壳一向是被人所丢弃的废物。中国食品公司上海供应站自属鸡鸭加工厂，以及委托公私合营茂昌蛋业冷藏公司蛋品制造厂，仅在去年一年加工蛋制品拷下来的蛋壳而倒掉的，就有四百多万斤。现在利用蛋壳做饲料，以目前蛋壳平均出粉率百分之八十计算，则每年就可以节约三百万斤以上的粮食。
    现在，这个车间又安装好了一部新的机器，准备增加蛋壳粉的生产。
