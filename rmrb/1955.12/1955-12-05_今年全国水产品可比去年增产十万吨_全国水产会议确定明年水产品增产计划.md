Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd—According to the recent National Aquatic Products Conference jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce, the total national aquatic products output this year is expected to complete the original plan, increasing by 100,000 tons compared to last year, and increasing by 62% compared to the highest annual output before the Anti-Japanese War.

The development of the fisheries cooperation movement is one of the main factors contributing to the increase in aquatic product output this year. According to statistics from fourteen provinces and cities in September or October this year, there are more than 3,000 fisheries production cooperatives and more than 188,000 fisheries mutual aid groups. The number of fishing households participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations accounts for 40% of the total number of fishing households in these provinces and cities. According to surveys, fisheries production cooperatives generally increase production by about 30% compared to individual fishing households, and fisheries mutual aid groups increase production by about 20% compared to individual fishing households.

State loans for fisheries and technical guidance to fishermen have also strongly promoted the development of fisheries production. At the same time, the state has established more than 200 typhoon warning stations and more than 70 navigation marks and lighthouses along the coast to protect the safe production of fishermen.

There are currently 20 state-owned marine and freshwater fishing enterprises and 85 aquaculture enterprises in the country. The output of these state-owned aquatic product enterprises this year may increase by 19% compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd—In order to allow people to eat more fresh aquatic products, the recent National Aquatic Products Conference jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce determined that the planned total national aquatic product output for 1956 will increase by 7.5% compared to 1955.

According to the State Council's instructions on assigning aquatic product production, processing, transportation, and sales enterprises to the unified leadership of the Ministry of Commerce, this conference focused on discussing and resolving the issue of unified aquatic product business organizations.

The conference pointed out that in the future, under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Commerce, state-owned aquatic product enterprises will operate and develop in a more planned manner; under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, the fisheries cooperation movement will vigorously unfold by implementing the policy of "overall planning and strengthened leadership"; state economic assistance and technical guidance to fishermen will be further strengthened; and private fishermen and merchants will also gradually complete socialist transformation. Therefore, the task of developing aquatic product production and increasing the supply of fresh aquatic products can be completely fulfilled and overfulfilled in the future.

    今年全国水产品可比去年增产十万吨
    全国水产会议确定明年水产品增产计划
    新华社三日讯　据最近农业部和商业部联合召开的全国水产会议预计，今年全国水产品总产量可以完成原定计划，比去年增产十万吨，比抗日战争前最高年产量增加百分之六十二。
    渔业合作化运动的发展，是今年水产品增产的主要因素之一。据十四个省、市在今年九月或十月的统计，共有渔业生产合作社三千多个，渔业互助组十八万八千多个，参加互助合作组织的渔户已占这些省、市渔户总数的百分之四十。据调查，渔业生产合作社一般比单干渔户增产百分之三十左右，渔业互助组比单干渔户增产百分之二十左右。
    国家对渔民发放渔业贷款，进行技术指导，也有力地促进了渔业生产的发展。同时，国家已经在沿海设立暴风警报站二百多处，航标、灯塔七十多处，保护渔民安全生产。
    全国现有海洋、淡水的国营捕捞企业二十处，养殖企业八十五处。这些国营水产企业今年的产量可以比去年增加百分之十九。
    新华社三日讯　为了使人民吃到更多的鲜活水产品，最近农业部和商业部联合召开的全国水产会议确定，一九五六年全国水产品总产量计划比一九五五年增加百分之七点五。
    根据国务院关于将水产生产、加工、运销企业划归商业部统一领导的指示，这次会议着重讨论和解决了统一水产业务机构的问题。
    会议指出，今后在商业部统一领导下，国营水产企业将更有计划地经营和发展；在中共各级组织领导下，渔业合作化运动将贯彻执行“全面规划，加强领导”的方针而蓬勃展开；国家对渔民的经济援助和技术指导将进一步加强；私营渔商也将逐步完成社会主义改造。因此，今后发展水产生产和增加鲜活水产品供应的任务完全有可能完成和超额完成。
