    Producing According to the State Plan
    The Xin Jian (New Construction) Mingfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shanlian Township, Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, discussed how to plant rapeseed according to the state plan on the third day after its establishment.
    Initially, some core members and cooperative members hesitated when they heard that they had to plant ninety mu of rapeseed, because they were afraid that there would not be enough fields suitable for planting rapeseed and that there would not be enough labor. However, the cooperative chairman, Yuan Kouzi, and other people insisted that the cooperative should take the lead in adapting to the requirements of the state plan and plant more rapeseed. For this matter, the members' congress met for a whole night without reaching a conclusion. The next day, the chairman and vice-chairman specifically studied whether the cooperative had enough land suitable for planting rapeseed and whether there was enough labor. They found that there were more than one hundred mu of land in the whole cooperative that was high-lying and convenient for irrigation. These fields are suitable for planting rapeseed. They also tried to arrange the current farm work: if the late rice is harvested first, then wheat and broad beans are planted, and finally rapeseed is planted, the entire cooperative's eighty-nine male and female laborers will be completely sufficient. In this way, the concerns of the cooperative members were resolved. They also calculated the account for the members regarding the increase in income from planting rapeseed last year by the three mutual aid teams before the transfer to the cooperative, explaining that planting ninety mu of rapeseed this year could greatly increase income. After the cooperative members realized that planting rapeseed was beneficial to the country and the cooperative, their enthusiasm for planting rapeseed greatly increased.
    Through the hard work of all the cooperative members, the entire cooperative has planted a total of one hundred mu of rapeseed successively. Now the early-planted rapeseed seedlings are already three inches tall and growing thick and strong.

    按照国家计划生产
    浙江省吴兴县善琏乡新建明丰农业生产合作社在建立起来的第三天，就讨论了怎样按照国家计划种植油菜的问题。
    最初，有部分骨干和社员听说要种九十亩油菜，就犹豫起来，他们怕能种油菜的田不够，怕劳力不够。社长袁扣子和另一部分人却坚持说：合作社要带头适应国家计划的要求，多种油菜。为了这件事，社员大会开了一个晚上也没有讨论出个结果。第二天，正、副社长专门研究了社里是否有足够的适宜种油菜的土地和劳动力是否够用的问题。他们发现，在全社的土地中，地势高、灌水方便的田足有一百来亩。这些田都适宜种油菜。他们又试着安排了当前的农活：如果先收割好晚稻，再种小麦、蚕豆、最后种油菜，全社八十九个男女劳动力也完全够用。这样社员们所担心的问题都解决了。他们还向社员算了转社前的三个互助组去年种油菜增加了收入的账，说明今年种好九十亩油菜，可以大大增加收入。社员们认识了种油菜对国家对合作社都有好处以后，他们种油菜的积极性就大大提高了。
    经过全体社员的辛勤劳动，全社先后共种了一百亩油菜。现在早种的菜秧已经三寸来高，长得又粗又壮。
