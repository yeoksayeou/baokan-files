Xinhua News Agency, December 28th. The Ministry of Geology, in order to accelerate the fulfillment of mineral resources needed by industry and agriculture, has decided to strive to complete the first Five-Year Geological Exploration Plan ahead of schedule. This was announced by a person in charge of the Ministry of Geology today when interviewed by a Xinhua News Agency reporter. The person in charge said that considering the country's urgent needs and various favorable factors, the Ministry of Geology recently increased the total annual geological exploration workload stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan by 30 percent when formulating the 1956 geological exploration plan, especially preparing to increase core drilling footage, and at the same time increasing the planned reserve growth of some major minerals. In this way, by the end of next year, the Ministry of Geology may strive to complete or nearly complete the five-year plan for exploring the reserves of certain major minerals such as iron, copper, lead, zinc, phosphorus, and coal.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Geology said that as long as the socialist construction enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and technical personnel is fully utilized, various measures are actively taken, conservative thinking is opposed, and weak links in the work are overcome, the geological department system has the conditions to complete the Five-Year Geological Exploration Plan ahead of schedule. For example, next year the Ministry of Geology plans to vigorously implement design and budget systems, implement various technical specifications, and promote quotas and piecework wages for drilling based on advanced Soviet experience. This can greatly improve efficiency, improve quality, and reduce costs. According to preliminary statistics from units that piloted the system this year, simply implementing quotas and piecework wages for drilling can increase drilling efficiency by more than 20 percent. Next year, the Ministry of Geology also plans to promote more than a dozen important advanced technical measures. At the same time, in the past few years, geological exploration personnel have accumulated experience in their work and improved their technical level. This year, the average monthly efficiency of drilling rigs has increased by more than 70 percent compared to 1953. College students who started working two years ago, with the help of Soviet experts and veteran technical personnel, coupled with their own hard work, can now mostly work independently. This is a very important condition for expanding the scale of exploration work and accelerating exploration work. In addition, after several years, especially this year's large-scale general survey work, exploration bases have been prepared for next year, which provides a reliable guarantee for the realization of next year's mineral reserve growth plan.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Geology said that in order to ensure the completion of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the Ministry of Geology and its subordinate geological bureaus have all initially formulated measures, and will further mobilize the broad masses of workers and engineering and technical personnel to ensure the realization of these measures.

    争取提前完成五年地质勘探计划
    新华社二十八日讯　地质部为了加速满足工业和农业所需要的矿产资源，决定争取提前完成第一个五年地质勘探计划。这是地质部负责人今天在接见新华社记者的时候宣布的。负责人说，由于考虑到国家的迫切需要和各种有利因素，地质部最近在制定一九五六年地质勘探计划的时候，把第一个五年计划规定的年度地质勘探工作总量提高了百分之三十，特别是准备提高岩心钻探进尺，同时把一些主要矿产的储量增长计划提高了。这样，到明年年底，地质部某些主要矿产如铁、铜、铅锌、磷、煤等的五年内要探明的储量的计划，就可能争取完成或接近完成。
    地质部负责人说，只要充分发挥广大职工和技术人员的社会主义建设热情，积极采取各种措施，反对保守思想，克服工作中的薄弱环节，地质部系统提前完成五年地质勘探计划是有条件的。例如，明年地质部计划根据苏联先进经验，大力实行设计和预算制度，贯彻各种技术规范，推行定额和钻探计件工资制，这就可以大大提高效率、提高质量，并且可以降低成本。根据今年初步试行的单位统计，仅推行定额和钻探计件工资制，就可以提高钻探效率百分之二十以上。地质部明年还计划推广十几种重要先进技术措施。同时，在过去几年内，地质勘探人员在工作中积累了经验，提高了技术水平。今年钻机的台月效率平均比一九五三年提高了百分之七十以上。两年前参加工作的大专学校的学生，在苏联专家和老技术人员的帮助下，加上他们自己艰苦学习，现在大都可以独立工作了。这对于扩大勘探工作规模、加速勘探工作，是一个很重要的条件。此外，经过几年来特别是今年的大规模普查工作，已经为明年准备了勘探基地，这就使明年矿储量增长计划的实现有了可靠的保证。
    地质部负责人说，为了保证提前完成五年计划，地质部和所属各地质局都已经初步制定了措施，并且将进一步发动广大职工和工程技术人员保证实现这些措施。
