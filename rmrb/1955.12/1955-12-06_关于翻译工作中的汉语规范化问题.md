    On the Standardization of the Chinese Language in Translation Work
    Bi Ke, Xu Mingke
    Translation departments bear a significant responsibility in promoting the standardization of the Chinese language. In recent decades, especially since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have translated a large number of works from the Soviet Union and other countries in the fields of social science, natural science, literature, and art. These works have a wide readership, and readers are greatly influenced by them not only ideologically but also in terms of vocabulary. We have indeed absorbed many good things from foreign languages and enriched our own. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "We should absorb what we need from foreign languages... We should absorb not only their progressive ideas but also their fresh expressions." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol. III, p. 838) It is clear that translation work plays a significant role in promoting the standardization and enrichment of the Chinese language.
    In the process of translating Marxist-Leninist classics, the Compilation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, due to its work requirements, has done some unifying work in terms of transliteration, translation of names, use of characters, and use of words, and has strived to make the grammar and rhetoric of the translations conform to the grammatical habits of the Chinese language. However, it has not raised this to the level of Chinese language standardization, and what has been done is still far from enough. In the future, we should pay more attention to this aspect. Here, we will briefly discuss the work carried out by the Compilation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the past three years in the area of Chinese language standardization, that is, in terms of transliteration, vocabulary, and grammar and rhetoric, for everyone's reference and correction.
    In terms of transliteration, the Compilation Bureau mainly uses its own compiled and printed Russian-Chinese transliteration table to translate names of people and places, striving to unify the translation methods and the use of characters for transliteration of names of people and places. The basic principles of transliteration are: (1) Beijing pronunciation is the standard. (2) Transliteration follows the principle of "names from the masters," but commonly used names of people and places that have been used for a long time will not be re-translated even if there are some discrepancies in transliteration. (3) Names of people are transliterated according to the principles of same name, same translation; same surname, same translation; and same sound, same translation. (4) The characters used for transliteration are common and easy to understand, not uncommon characters (such as 嘎, 忒, 剌, etc.), and not characters that are easily connected to form meaning in the context (such as 则, 拿, etc.).
  (5) Generally, the transliteration of male and female names should make it clear at a glance whether they are male or female. For example, the end of male names can be transliterated as Ke, Qi, Ze, or Ski, and the end of female names can be transliterated as Sha, Ma, Li, or Li. The ends of female names can use Na, Wa, Niang, or Kaya. (6) The characters used for transliteration of names of people and places should be consistent not only within one translated work but also in all translated works of the Compilation Bureau. At present, our country's translation community lacks a unified Russian-Chinese transliteration table, so the characters used for transliteration in various books and periodicals have not yet been unified, and this lack of uniformity needs to be eliminated as soon as possible.
    In terms of vocabulary in translations, we have carried out two tasks: unifying the characters used and unifying the translated names. First, let's talk about the issue of unifying the characters used. In the past and present, the translations published in our country's newspapers and magazines have been very inconsistent in the use of characters and words. Sometimes misspellings are used, and sometimes newly created characters (and words) are used. In order to ensure the correctness and uniformity of the characters (and words) used in the translation of classics, we compiled a "Compilation of Unified Characters Used," which we began to use starting with Volume 1 of "The Complete Works of Stalin." The principles we followed in compiling this compilation are: First, do not return to the past, but be reliable and based on evidence; second, take habits into account, but do not follow suit; third, consult with linguists on ambiguous characters. This compilation is mostly based on the characters and words used in "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Party documents, "Cihai," and "Complete Works of Lu Xun." However, since the first and second batches of simplified Chinese character lists were published, those characters have been based on the simplified Chinese character lists.
    Next, let's talk about the issue of unifying translated names. The scope of translated names is very broad, including names in all aspects such as people, places, books, newspapers, magazines, resolutions, documents, theories, doctrines, parties, organizations, institutions, groups, specialized terms, etc. The unification of translated names is a complex scientific research task. As everyone knows, inconsistent translated names often cause ideological confusion and affect readers' understanding of the translation. For example, the translated name "Шушенское село" has eleven different translations in ten books: "Shushinsko Village," "Shushen Village," "Shushi Village," "Shushenskoye Village," "Shoushan Village," "Shousha Village," "Shoushashsk Village," "Shoushanskr Village," "Susinskoi Village," "Sushesck Village," and "Susinskao Village." If a reader who does not understand foreign languages reads these translated names, they will ask: "Which village in the Minusinsk district of Yeniseysk province was Lenin exiled to in the first half of 1897?" (According to our investigation of relevant geographical materials, "Шушенское село" is more appropriate to translate as "Shushensk Village.") As for the phenomenon of inconsistent names of people or other professional nouns in the same translated work, there are many, even translating one word into many synonyms, such as translating "кукуруза" as "yushushu," "yumi," "baomi," "bangzi," "baomi," "baogu," and "dashushu" (it seems more appropriate to translate it as "yushushu" according to the common translation), and similar phenomena are not uncommon. From these examples, it can be seen that the phenomenon of inconsistent translated names is quite serious. The diverse translations of a noun not only fail to enrich our language but also make our language more divergent and repetitive in terms of vocabulary.
    In the process of translating Marxist-Leninist classics, we try to use nationally used vocabulary. In order to adopt more commonly used terms when determining translated names, we collected a large amount of translated name data from high-quality translations of Marxist-Leninist classics and some translations in the fields of history and geography, and made them into cards for reference. In order to ensure the uniformity of translated names in the classics, we always make cards of the translated names that should be unified in each volume for reference. At the same time, when determining translated names, in addition to following the resolutions and documents of the Party and government, we also often consult with various domestic professional institutions and academic groups.
    In terms of grammar and rhetoric, we strive to make the translation "correct in meaning and smooth in translation." That is to say, to make the translation conform to both the meaning of the original work and the habits of our language. In order to achieve this, we have taken the following measures: First, we repeatedly study, deliberate, and revise the translation. For example, in an article in the second volume of "The Complete Works of Stalin," the initial draft translated a passage as: "We cannot inflexibly resist all and everything consultative conferences, as some indignant and not completely normal 'individuals' propose to do; conversely, we cannot inflexibly decide to participate in consultative conferences, as our constitutional democratic party-style comrades actually imagine." This translation has too many unnecessary words and does not conform to the general grammatical habits of Chinese. Later, it was revised to: "We cannot, as proposed by some indignant and not completely normal 'individuals,' resist all consultative conferences across the board; conversely, we cannot, as imagined by our constitutional democratic party-type comrades, decide to participate in consultative conferences across the board."
    Second, we have established a full-time rhetoric editor, whose task is to revise the translation from a Chinese perspective, point out ambiguous, illogical, and incomprehensible words and sentences in the translation, and correct grammatical errors, inappropriate word usage, and incorrect punctuation marks in the translation.
    Third, we have established a reading system, the purpose of which is to make the translation "easy to read aloud and pleasing to the ear." For example, after the final draft of the translation, one person reads the draft aloud, and one or two people listen while looking at the Russian text, checking for any omissions or mistranslations; another one or two people listen while looking at the Chinese text, listening to see if it is smooth and conforms to Chinese grammar. Experience has proven that this is an accurate measure of whether a translation conforms to grammatical habits and a good way to diagnose problems in the translation.
    In addition, in the translation, we also strive to avoid sentences composed of fifty or sixty words, which are redundant and cannot be read in one or two breaths; however, sometimes in order to express the meaning of the classics accurately, we still retain the form of long sentences under certain circumstances.
    In addition to the above work, we have also done some work in unifying citations and unifying specifications. As everyone knows, the citations in the classics mostly indicate important arguments and viewpoints. The same citation (including punctuation marks) sometimes appears in different volumes or in several places in one volume, so we must unify them one by one; otherwise, it may sometimes cause ideological confusion and lead to misunderstandings. Therefore, we made cards to ensure the uniformity of citations in the compiled volumes of the classics.
    The uniformity of specifications refers to the consistency in the usage and writing of punctuation marks, page number footnotes, abbreviations and full names, year, month, day, time, honorifics, fonts, layout, signatures at the end of articles, numbers, citation sources, audience reactions, etc. For example, in Lenin's works, there are various types of fonts and symbols: paragraphs of italics, partial spaced italics, bold italics, bold capital and lowercase letters, etc. Since the specifications in the original works are so complex, with each symbol representing a meaning, the specifications expressed in the translation cannot be simplified naturally. Therefore, combined with the current printing conditions, we try to use the existing specification features in Chinese, classify and sort the various Chinese and Russian specifications one by one, and make appropriate arrangements on the premise of not affecting the aesthetics of the layout, so that they each perform their duties and are in their proper places. Secondly, for example, in Stalin's works, especially in documents such as reports and speeches, there are often several usages to express the audience's feelings, such as "laughter," "big laugh," "ha ha laughter," "full audience laughter," and "full audience cheers," and we correspondingly distinguish them in the translation.
    This is some of the work we have carried out in translating classics related to the standardization of the Chinese language in the past three years. Obviously, there are still many shortcomings in our work in this area, and there are still many things we should have done but have not done in terms of using the language of our motherland. In the future, in translating Marxist-Leninist classics, we are willing to work together with translators, theorists, linguists, educators, and the broad masses of working people across the country to reduce divergences and confusion in the pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary of our Chinese language as much as possible, enhance unity, and absorb good things from foreign languages as much as possible to enrich the language of our motherland.

    关于翻译工作中的汉语规范化问题
    毕克  徐鸣珂
    在推行汉语规范化的工作中，翻译工作部门也负有重大的责任。近数十年来，特别是从中华人民共和国成立以来，我们大量地翻译了苏联和其他国家的社会科学、自然科学、文学艺术等方面的著作。这些著作大多数都拥有广大的读者。读者从这些著作中不仅思想上受到了很大影响，而且在词汇方面也受到了很大影响。我们从外国语言中确实吸收了许多好东西，丰富了我们的语言。毛泽东同志指示我们：“要从外国语言中吸收我们所需要的成份。……不但要吸收他们的进步道理，而且要吸收他们的新鲜用语。”（“毛泽东选集”第三卷第八三八页）可见翻译工作在促进汉语规范化和丰富汉语方面有重大的作用。
    在翻译马克思列宁主义经典著作的过程中，中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局由于工作上的需要，曾经在译音、译名、用字、用词等方面做了一些统一工作，在译文语法修辞方面力求做到符合汉语的语法习惯，但是未提到汉语规范化这样的高度，而且做的还很不够。今后我们应当在这一方面多加注意。这里仅将中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局三年来在汉语规范化方面即在译音、词汇和语法修辞等方面所进行的工作简要地谈一下，以供大家参考和指正。
    在译音方面，编译局主要是用自己编印的俄华译音表翻译人名和地名，力求做到人名、地名译法和译音用字的统一。译音的基本原则是：（一）以北京语音为标准。（二）按“名从主人”的原则译音，但是习用已久的人名、地名即使在译音上有些出入也不另译。（三）人名按同名同译、同姓同译、同音同译的原则译音。（四）译音用字采用常见易懂的字，不用冷僻的字（如嘎、忒、剌等字），不用跟上下文容易连成意思的字（如则、拿等字）。
  （五）男女人名译音一般要做到一望而知为男性或女性，例如男性人名字尾可依音采用柯、奇、泽、斯基等；女性人名则依音采用莎、玛、丽、莉等，女性名字字尾采用娜、娃、娘、卡娅等。（六）人名和地名译音用字，不仅在一本译著中要前后一致，而且在编译局所有译著中都要一致。目前，我国翻译界还缺乏一个统一的俄华译音表，所以各种书刊上的译音用字还未取得一致，这种不统一的现象须要早日消除。
    在译文词汇方面，我们进行了用字统一和译名统一两项工作。首先谈用字统一的问题。过去和现在，我国书报杂志登载的译文在用字和用词上很不一致，有时用了错别字，有时用了生造的字（和词）。为了做到经典著作译文用字（和词）的正确和统一，我们编了一本“统一用字汇编”，从“斯大林全集”第一卷就开始用起了。我们编辑这本汇编的原则是：一、不复古，但要信而有据；二、要照顾习惯，但不随声附和；三、模棱两可的字则同语言学家商榷。这本汇编大都是根据“毛泽东选集”、党的文件、“辞海”、“鲁迅全集”用过的字和词整理出来的。但是自从第一二两批试用的简化汉字表发布以后，那些字即以简化汉字表为依据了。
    其次谈译名统一问题。译名的范围很广，包括人名、地名、书报、杂志、决议、文件、学说、主义、党派、组织、机关、团体、专门术语等各个方面的名称。译名的统一是一项繁复的科学研究工作。大家知道，译名不统一，往往会造成思想上的混乱，影响读者对译文的理解。例如“Шушенскоесело”这个译名在十本书中就有十一种译法：“舒辛斯科野村”、“舒申村”、“舒施村”、“舒申斯科耶村”、“寿山村”、“寿沙村”、“寿沙斯克村”、“寿山斯克村”、“苏辛斯科伊村”、“苏舍斯克村”“苏新斯考野村”。如果一个不懂外文的读者看了这些译名之后就会问：“列宁一八九七年上半年究竟被流放到叶尼塞省米努辛斯克州的哪个村子？”（根据我们查考有关地理方面的材料，“Шушенскоесело”译作“舒申斯克村”似较妥当。）至于人名或其他专业名词在同一本译著里前后不统一的现象是很多的，甚至把一个词译成许多同义语，如把“кукуруза”译作“玉蜀黍”、“玉米”、“苞米”、“棒子”、“包米”、“包谷”、“大蜀黍”（按照通行的译法译作“玉蜀黍”似较妥当）等类似的现象很不少。从这些例子可以看出，译名不统一的现象是相当严重的。一个名词的译法多种多样，不仅不能丰富我们的语言，反而使我们的语言在词汇方面更加分歧和重复。
    我们在翻译马克思列宁主义经典著作的过程中尽量采用全国通用的词汇。为了在确定译名时采用比较通用的，我们从质量较好的马克思列宁主义经典著作译本中以及从历史、地理方面的一些译本中搜集了大批译名资料，制成卡片，作为参考。为了保证经典著作中的译名统一，我们随时将各卷应行统一的译名也制成卡片，以备查用。同时在确定译名时，我们除了根据党和政府的决议、文件之外，还经常同国内各专业机关和学术团体商榷。
    在语法修辞方面，我们力求使译文“意思正确，译文通顺”。也就是说，使译文既符合原著意思，又合乎我们语言的习惯。为了要做到这一点，我们采取了以下的办法：第一、对译文一再研究、推敲、修改。例如在“斯大林全集”第二卷的一篇文章中，初译稿有一段译作：“我们不能一成不变地抵制所有一切协商会议，如像某些愤激的和不完全正常的‘个别人物’提议要做的那样；反过来说，也不能一成不变地决定参加协商会，如像我们那些立宪民主党人式的同志们居然想像的那样。”这段译文句子太啰嗦，又不合乎一般汉语的语法习惯。后来改译作：“我们不能像某些被激怒的和不完全正常的‘个人’所提议的那样，对任何协商会议一概加以抵制；反过来说，我们也不能像我们那些立宪民主党人型的同志们所想像的那样，对协商会一概决定参加。”
    第二、设专职修辞员，其任务是专从汉语角度修订译文，指出译文中含混不清、不合逻辑、难以理解的词句，纠正译文中语法不通、用词不当、标点符号不对之处。
    第三、建立朗读制度，其目的在于使译文“念得上口，听得顺耳”。例如在译文定稿以后，由一个人朗读译稿，一两个人在旁边一面听，一面看俄文，检查译文有无漏译或错译的地方；另外一两个人在旁边一面听，一面看中文，听一听是否通顺，是否合乎汉语语法。经验证明，这是鉴别译文合乎不合乎语法习惯的准确的尺度，也是诊断译文有没有毛病的好办法。
    此外，在译文中我们也力求避免一个句子由五六十个字组成，冗赘不堪，以至一两口气也念不完；但是有时为了使经典著作意思表达得准确，在一定情况下还是保留长句的形式的。
    除了上述工作之外，我们在引文统一、规格统一方面也做了一些工作。大家知道，经典著作中的引文大都表明重要的论点和看法。同一段引文（包括标点符号在内）有时出现在不同的卷次或者出现在一卷中的好几个地方，这样，我们就必须一一做到统一；不然，有时也会造成思想上的混乱，引起误解。因此，我们制作了卡片，以保证编译的各卷经典著作中的引文统一。
    规格的统一是指标点符号、页码注码、简称全称、年月日时、称呼语、字体、行款、篇末签署、数字、引文出处、听众反应等用法和写法的一致。例如在列宁的著作中，字体和符号是多种多样的：成段的斜体字，局部的加空斜体字，黑体斜体，黑体大小写等等。既然原著中的规格这样繁复，一种符号代表一种意思，那末表现在译文中的规格自然就不能简单化了。因此，结合目前的印刷条件，我们尽量利用中文中已有的规格特点，把中俄文的各种规格一一排队分类，在不影响版面美观的前提下，进行了适当的安插，使得它们各司其事，各得其所。其次，又如在斯大林的著作中，尤其是报告、讲演等类文献中常常为了表示听众的心情，就有“笑声”、“大笑”、“哈哈大笑”、“全场大笑”、“全场欢呼”等几种用法，我们在译文中也相应地加以区别。
    这就是我们三年来在翻译经典著作方面所进行的有关汉语规范化的一点工作。很显然，我们在这方面做的工作还存在着许多缺点，在运用祖国语言方面还有很多应做而未做的事情。今后，我们在翻译马克思列宁主义经典著作中愿同全国翻译工作者、理论工作者、语文工作者、教育工作者以及全国广大的劳动群众一起，群策群力，使我们汉语在语音、语法、词汇等方面尽量减少分歧和混乱，增强统一性，并尽可能从外国语中吸收好的东西，以丰富我们祖国的语言。
