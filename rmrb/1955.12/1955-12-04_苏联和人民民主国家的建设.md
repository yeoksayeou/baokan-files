    Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries Construction

    Ukraine Applies Atomic Energy in Agriculture
    This year, many collective farms and state farms in the Ukrainian Republic of the Soviet Union have achieved significant results in crop cultivation by applying atomic energy.
    The experimental farm of the Institute of Plant Physiology and Agrochemistry of Ukraine, located near Kyiv, and the state-owned vegetable farm in Kherson, this year, before planting tomatoes and cabbage, first placed a very small amount of radioactive sulfur in peat-humus clods, or soaked the tomato and cabbage seeds in a radioactive sulfur solution. As a result, the yields of tomatoes and cabbage generally increased by 25% to 40%. The Stalin Collective Farm in Vinnytsia Oblast treated beet seeds with radioactive sulfur before planting, which increased the beet harvest by 33 centners per hectare (1 centner equals 100 kilograms), and the beet roots were particularly large. The "Miner" State Farm in Stalino Oblast increased the yield of winter wheat by 3 centners per hectare after using radioactive sulfur.
    Not long ago, the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union convened a special committee meeting on the application of tracer atom methods to study the achievements of the Ukrainian Republic in cultivating crops using tracer atoms and radioactive isotopes. Facts have proven that radioactive substances can have an effect and influence on plant tissues; in cold climates, atomic energy can replace the radiant heat of the sun, thereby promoting plant photosynthesis and increasing plant yields.

    North Korean City Reconstruction Work Continues to Progress
    The work of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to rebuild cities destroyed by the war is constantly progressing.
    In Chongjin, a huge administrative and industrial center on the east coast, shops and other production units in the suburban industrial zone are opening one after another. A blast furnace at the Kim Chaek Ironworks has recently been repaired and has begun production. Chongjin's main street, Stalin Street, has been completely repaired, and many other streets have also been repaired, with a total length of 130 kilometers. More than 4,000 houses have been repaired and rebuilt in this city. On the square opposite the railway station, the magnificent buildings of the Art Theater, Chongjin Cinema, and Open-Air Cinema have been erected.
    In Hamhung, the buildings of the Fourth School and a technical school have appeared on the central square. The construction of the dormitory of the Women's Normal College, the Chemical Research Institute, and several apartment buildings is underway. In this year alone, about 100 apartments have been built in Hamhung.
    In Kaesong, the ancient city, ten factories have been built in the two years since the end of the war, and these factories have already started operations. The main streets in the city have been paved with asphalt. Apartment houses and cultural and educational institutions are being rapidly restored or rebuilt.

    Vietnam Achieves Success in Protecting Dikes and Preventing Floods
    In the past four or five months, the people of 19 provinces and three major cities in northern Vietnam have raised or repaired more than 3,000 kilometers of river dikes, thereby preventing the largest flood on record. The achievements of Vietnam's flood control work have guaranteed this year's autumn harvest.
    A total of 1.3 million people participated in flood control work. They worked 18 million labor days, completed 11.5 million cubic meters of earthwork and more than 240,000 cubic meters of stonework, and repaired or rebuilt more than 400 culverts. This work would have taken almost eight years to complete during the former French rule.
    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has allocated more than 12 million Vietnamese dong to help the people protect the dikes.

    Mongolian Industrial Sector Launches Socialist Competition
    In the first two years and ten months since the start of the second five-year plan (1953-1957), the national industrial sector of the Mongolian People's Republic completed 103.2% of the plan. These achievements are due to the extensive launch of socialist competition and the promotion of advanced experience. The implementation of rationalization proposals in production has saved the country more than 700,000 tugriks (Mongolian currency) in state funds.

    Albanian Agricultural Production Cooperatives Develop
    Albanian agricultural production cooperatives more than doubled during the first five-year plan (1951-1955), and the area of land owned by the cooperatives almost tripled. Currently, the land cultivated by the cooperatives accounts for about 14% of the country's arable land.
    Last year, the average yield per unit area of wheat in Albanian agricultural production cooperatives was 24% higher than that of individual farmers, cotton was 112% higher, corn was 21.8% higher, and sugar beets were 194% higher. The harvests of advanced agricultural production cooperatives are increasing year by year. In 1954, their wheat yield per hectare more than doubled compared to 1951.
    Due to the development of production, the income of the cooperatives has greatly increased. In 1954, more than two-thirds of the cooperatives in the country became wealthy cooperatives with incomes of more than one million leks (Albanian currency), of which 15 cooperatives had incomes exceeding three million leks, and nine cooperatives exceeded five million leks.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    乌克兰在农业中应用原子能
    今年苏联乌克兰共和国的许多集体农庄和国营农场，在种植农作物方面应用原子能，已经获得了显著的效果。
    乌克兰植物生理和农作化学研究所设在基辅附近的实验农场和刻松的国营蔬菜农场，今年在种植番茄和白菜以前，先在泥炭腐植质泥块中放了极少量的放射性硫，或者把番茄和白菜的种子浸在放射性硫的溶液中。结果，番茄和白菜的收获量一般都增加了百分之二十五到四十。文尼萨州斯大林集体农庄在栽种甜菜以前，先将种子用放射性硫处理过，这样，每公顷（合十五市亩）的甜菜收获量就增加了三十三公担（每公担合二百市斤），而且甜菜的块根特别肥大。斯大林诺州“矿工”国营农场在使用放射性硫以后，每公顷冬小麦的产量增加了三公担。
    不久以前，苏联乌克兰科学院曾经召开一次示踪原子应用方法专门委员会会议，对乌克兰共和国利用示踪原子和放射性同位素来栽培农作物的成就进行了研究。事实证明，放射性物质对植物组织能够产生作用和影响；在寒冷的气候条件下，原子能可以代替太阳的辐射热，因而能够促进植物的光合作用，增加植物的产量。
    朝鲜城市重建工作不断进展
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为重建被战争破坏的城市的工作正在不断进行。
    在东海岸的巨大的行政和工商业中心清津市，市郊工业区的商店和其他生产单位一个接一个地开始营业了。金策制铁所的一个鼓风炉最近已经修复并且开始生产。清津市的主要大街斯大林大街已经完全修复，其他许多街道也修复了，这些道路的长度共为一百三十公里。在这个城市里，修好和重建了四千多幢住宅。火车站对面的广场上，已经矗立起艺术剧院、清津电影院和露天电影院的宏伟建筑物。
    在咸兴，中央广场上已经出现了第四学校和一个技术学校的建筑物。女子师范学院宿舍、化工研究所和若干公寓的高楼大厦的建筑工程正在进行。单是在今年，咸兴就建筑了约一百幢公寓。
    古城开城在战争结束以后的两年中，建筑了十个工厂，这些工厂都已经开工了。市中主要街道铺上了柏油。公寓房屋以及文化教育机关正在迅速恢复或者重建。
    越南在护堤防洪方面取得成就
    在过去的四、五个月里，越南北方十九省和三个主要城市的人民加高或者修缮了三千公里以上的河堤，从而防止了有记录以来最大的洪水泛滥。越南防洪工作的成就保证了今年的秋天的丰收。
    总共有一百三十万人参加了防洪工作。他们工作了一千八百万个劳动日，完成了一千一百五十万土方工程和二十四万多石方工程，修缮或者重建了四百多条暗渠。这些工作如果在以前法国统治时期，差不多需要八年才能做出。
    越南民主共和国政府曾经拨出越币一千二百多万元帮助人民保护堤坝。
    蒙古工业部门开展社会主义竞赛
    蒙古人民共和国在从第二个五年计划（一九五三—一九五七）开始以来的两年零十个月中，国家工业部门完成了计划的百分之一百零三点二。这些成绩的取得，是由于广泛地展开了社会主义竞赛和推广了先进经验。在生产中实行合理化建议的结果，共为国家节约了国家资金七十多万图格里克（蒙币）。
    阿农业生产合作社发展
    阿尔巴尼亚农业生产合作社在第一个五年计划期间（一九五一—一九五五年）增加了一倍以上，合作社所拥有的土地面积差不多增加了两倍，现在，合作社耕种的土地约占全国耕地面积的百分之十四。
    去年，阿尔巴尼亚农业生产合作社小麦的单位面积产量平均比个体农民高百分之二十四，棉花高百分之一百一十二，玉蜀黍高百分之二十一点八，甜菜高百分之一百九十四。先进的农业生产合作社的收成一年比一年增加，一九五四年它们每公顷小麦的产量比一九五一年增加了一倍以上。
    由于生产的发展，合作社的收入大大增加。一九五四年，全国有三分之二以上的合作社成了收入在一百万里克（阿币）以上的富裕合作社，其中有十五个合作社的收入超过三百万里克，九个合作社超过了五百万里克。（据新华社讯）
