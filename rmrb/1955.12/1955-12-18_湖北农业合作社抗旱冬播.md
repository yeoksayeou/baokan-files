    Hubei Agricultural Cooperatives Fight Drought for Winter Planting
    By the end of November, Hubei Province had sown over 12 million mu of wheat and 3 million mu of rapeseed, completing 80% of the province's winter planting plan. In the northern and western regions of Hubei, where the planting season started earlier, counties like Fangxian, Xianfeng, and Xingshan have already completed or exceeded their winter planting plans.
    Although Hubei Province experienced a prolonged autumn drought this year, the rapid development of agricultural production cooperatives to over 90,000 actively led the broad masses of farmers to carry out a massive drought resistance struggle, finally ensuring the smooth progress of winter planting. In Yingcheng County, agricultural cooperatives mobilized the broad masses of farmers to use more than 7,300 waterwheels daily to draw water and rush planting. In Bai'gao District of Macheng County, under the leadership of 167 agricultural cooperatives, the entire district had 25,000 people drawing water and cultivating the land every day. Many agricultural cooperatives used double-wheeled, double-shared plows to till the hillside fields that individual farmers could not plow with old plows, expanding the area for winter planting. In the Binhu area of ​​Qichun County, agricultural cooperatives also reclaimed 6,000 mu of wasteland in the lake area during winter planting.
    Currently, in areas where winter planting has been completed, agricultural cooperatives are leading the broad masses of farmers in checking seedlings, replanting missing seedlings, and protecting seedlings. In areas where the winter planting plan has not yet been completed, crash planting is underway. (Yuan Jun, Yang Sen, et al.)

    湖北农业合作社抗旱冬播
    湖北省到十一月底已经播种小麦一千二百多万亩，油菜三百万亩，全省冬播计划完成了百分之八十。播种季节比较早的鄂北和鄂西地区，房县、咸丰、兴山等县已经完成和超额完成了冬播计划。
    湖北省今年虽然发生了长时间的秋旱，但是由于农业生产合作社迅速发展到九万多个，它们积极带动广大农民开展了规模巨大的抗旱斗争，终于保证了冬播工作的顺利进行。应城县农业合作社带动广大农民每天出动七千三百多部水车车水抢种。麻城县白杲区在一百六十七个农业合作社的带动下，全区每天有两万五千人车水和耕种。许多农业合作社用双轮双铧犁翻耕了单干农民用旧犁耕不动的坂田，扩大了冬播面积。蕲春县滨湖地区的农业合作社还在冬播中开垦湖荒地六千亩。
    目前，已经完成冬播的地区，农业合作社正在带动广大农民进行查苗、补苗、保苗等工作；还没有完成冬播计划的地区，正在突击播种。（袁军　杨森等）
