Xinhua News Agency, December 11th. A national conference of agricultural implement manufacturers opened in Beijing today. This conference is being hosted by the National Committee of the All-China First Machine Building Trade Union. The agricultural implement manufacturers from various regions participating in the conference will discuss responding to the proposal from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory to organize a national inter-factory competition among agricultural implement factories, study and formulate specific measures for the inter-factory competition, and sign competition contracts.

This morning, representatives from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory reported on the process of their proposal. Following this, Kang Yonghe, Chairman of the National Committee of the All-China First Machine Building Trade Union, delivered a report entitled "Actively Support Our Farmer Brothers in Taking the Road of Cooperativization." Kang Yonghe said that the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Third Ministry of Machine Building, and the National Committee of the All-China First Machine Building Trade Union fully agree with and support the proposal of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory. In less than ten days after the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory put forward the proposal, more than ten factories have convened employee representative meetings and decided to respond to this proposal, and more factories are considering responding to this proposal. In order to encourage the masses' initiative and fully develop their creativity and enthusiasm, we have decided to hold this conference to organize a national inter-factory competition among agricultural implement factories. Kang Yonghe pointed out that the National Agricultural Implement Professional Conference, which closed yesterday, has already determined the plan for producing new agricultural implements next year. Agricultural implement factories across the country should resolutely implement the various decisions of this conference, earnestly mobilize the masses of workers, improve enterprise management, and complete the glorious task of producing more new agricultural implements for farmers. Kang Yonghe called on workers, engineers, technicians, and staff of agricultural implement factories across the country to actively participate in this friendly labor competition to support more than 500 million farmers in taking the road of cooperativization.

At the meeting, the director of the Kaifeng Machinery Factory, on behalf of the thirty-seven agricultural implement factory directors participating in the National Agricultural Implement Professional Conference, read a letter they wrote to the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, expressing their intention to conscientiously implement various competition measures and respond to the proposal to launch an inter-factory competition.

This afternoon, the heads of the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Third Ministry of Machine Building, the National Committee of the All-China First Machine Building Trade Union, and all the representatives attending the meeting, visited the Heping Township, Tiancun Township, and Xishan Township agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing. During their visits, they solicited farmers' opinions on agricultural implements and presented the farmers with three double-wheeled, double-furrow plows.

Participating in this meeting were more than thirty factory directors and trade union chairmen from agricultural implement factories in various regions, representatives from industrial departments and bureaus of nineteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and representatives from trade unions of twenty-two provinces and cities.
