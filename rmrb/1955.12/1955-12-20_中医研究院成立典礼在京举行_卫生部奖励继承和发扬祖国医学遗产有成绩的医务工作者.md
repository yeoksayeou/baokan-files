Xinhua News Agency, December 19th. The national Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine solemnly held its inauguration ceremony in Beijing on the 19th. The basic tasks of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine are: to inherit and promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, to promote the people's health cause and enrich modern medical science, to unite and cooperate with both Chinese and Western medicine, and to conduct research and organization of traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine knowledge and clinical experience in a step-by-step, planned, and systematic manner using scientific viewpoints and methods, and to cultivate teachers who can teach traditional Chinese medicine courses in medical colleges and universities and research talents in traditional Chinese medicine.

In the venue of the inaugural meeting, there was a banner with Premier Zhou Enlai's inscription for the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine: "Promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and serve socialist construction."

After Lu Zhijun, President of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, reported on the preparation process of the Academy at the meeting, Zhang Jichun, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke. Zhang Jichun congratulated the establishment of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, saying: Every small achievement of the Academy's research work will add glory to China's medical legacy, and increase contributions to the Chinese people and all mankind; at the same time, it will further prove that those who despise and obliterate Chinese medicine are wrong, and awaken more people to correctly understand and treat the cause of Chinese medicine. Zhang Jichun said: The Party and the government must continuously support the research work of traditional Chinese medicine. We believe that through the joint efforts of Chinese and Western medicine, great achievements will surely be made in the research work of traditional Chinese medicine.

Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of Health, expressed his gratitude to the veteran TCM practitioners and the newly transferred TCM doctors from various places for their hard work in participating in the TCM research work. He pointed out that the establishment of the Academy is only the beginning of the work. In the future, TCM research institutes will be established in various provinces and cities according to actual conditions, the leadership of TCM refresher schools in various provinces and cities will be strengthened, and TCM hospitals will be newly built and rectified, in order to carry out TCM research work. Famous TCM doctors Xiao Longyou, Shi Jinmo, and Zhang Cigong also spoke at the meeting.

Finally, the congress passed a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao.

Those who attended the ceremony today to congratulate included Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, as well as the leaders of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Second Office of the State Council, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Health Department of the Navy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Medical Association, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, and more than 400 Chinese and Western medical personnel from the capital.

It was established on the basis of five units, including the former Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Health, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Refresher School, the North China Traditional Chinese Medicine Experimental Institute, the North China Hospital Preparatory Office, and the Chinese Medicine Research Institute of the Central Health Research Institute.

Xinhua News Agency, December 19th.

The following received collective awards: the Japanese Encephalitis Treatment Group of Shijiazhuang City, the Hemorrhoids and Fistula Treatment Group of Chongqing, the Qigong Therapy Group of Tangshan City, as well as the relevant health and medical units in Shijiazhuang City, Chongqing City, Tangshan City and other places that actively supported and assisted these groups in their work. Mr. Xu Bihui, who disclosed the secret ancestral formula "Fushui Cao" (Ascites Herb), received an individual award.

More than a dozen surgeons in Beijing hospitals have learned from this group and promoted this therapy. The Tangshan Qigong Therapy Group is composed of Liu Guizhen, Director of the Tangshan Qigong Sanatorium, and Western medicine doctor Wang Shubin, etc. Qigong therapy is a unique guiding therapy method in Chinese national medicine. After curing his own stomach ulcer with qigong therapy, Liu Guizhen began to use qigong therapy to treat digestive ulcers, neurasthenia, and gastroptosis for others since 1949, and the treatment results were very good.

Mr. Xu Bihui of Changshan County, Zhejiang Province, disclosed his ancestral secret recipe for treating ascites, "Fushui Cao" (Ascites Herb), which has been passed down for three generations. The Changshan County Health Institute in Zhejiang Province used this secret recipe to treat 39 patients with schistosomiasis with ascites symptoms, and achieved good results.

    新华社十九日讯　全国性的中医研究院十九日在北京隆重举行成立典礼。中医研究院的基本任务是：继承和发扬祖国医学遗产，促进人民保健事业和丰富现代医学科学，由中西医团结合作，以科学观点和方法，有步骤有计划有系统地对中医中药知识和临床经验进行研究和整理，并且培养医学院校讲授中医课程的师资和中医药研究人材。
    在成立大会的会场上，挂着周恩来总理给中医研究院的题词：“发扬祖国医药遗产，为社会主义建设服务。”
    中医研究院院长鲁之俊在大会上报告中医研究院的筹备经过后，中共中央宣传部副部长张际春讲话。张际春祝贺中医研究院的成立，他说：中医研究院研究工作的每一点微小成果，都将给我国医学遗产添上光辉，给我国人民和全世界人类增加贡献；同时也将进一步证明那些轻视和抹煞中国医学的人是错误的，唤起更多的人来正确认识和对待中国医学的事业。张际春说：党和政府对于中医研究工作必须不断地支持，我们相信经过中医、西医的共同努力一定可以在中医研究工作上取得极大的成绩。
    卫生部副部长徐运北在讲话中，感谢中医老前辈和新近由各地调来的中医师不辞劳苦地参加中医研究工作。他指出研究院成立仅是工作的开始，今后将根据实际条件，在各省市分别成立中医研究所，加强各省市中医进修学校的领导，重点新建和整顿中医医院等，以开展中医研究工作。著名的中医师萧龙友、施今墨和章次公等都在会上讲了话。
    大会最后通过了向毛主席的致敬电。
    今天到会祝贺的还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深，国务院秘书长习仲勋，以及中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、中共中央统一战线工作部、国务院第二办公室、内务部、中国人民解放军海军卫生部、中国科学院、中华医学会、北京市人民委员会的负责人和首都的中西医人士共四百多人。

    中医研究院从一九五四年十一月间开始筹备，它是在原卫生部针灸疗法实验所、中医进修学校、华北中医实验所、华北医院筹备处和中央卫生研究院中国医药研究所等五个单位的基础上建立起来的。
    新华社十九日讯　在继承和发扬祖国医学遗产方面有成绩的一批医务工作者，十九日受到了中华人民共和国卫生部的奖励。受到集体奖励的是：石家庄市流行性乙型脑炎治疗小组、重庆痔瘘医疗小组、唐山市气功疗法小组以及积极支持和帮助这些小组进行工作的石家庄市、重庆市、唐山市等地有关的卫生医疗单位。受到个人奖励的是公开祖传秘方“腹水草”的徐碧辉先生。
    石家庄市流行性乙型脑炎治疗小组是在石家庄市卫生局局长袁以群的具体组织领导下，在石家庄市传染病医院进行工作的，主治中医师是郭可明。去年和今年，这个小组治疗了五十多个病人，有效率达百分之九十以上。今年，他们的治疗经验在辽宁、福建、四川、湖北、北京和唐山等地推广，都获得同样好的疗效。重庆痔瘘医疗小组是由中医师蒋厚甫、周济民、张荣辉、西医师李开泰、陈之寒五人组成的，他们在重庆市第一中医院（原为重庆市第七人民医院）和卫生部中央直属机关第六医院运用中医的枯痔散治疗内痔，用挂线法治疗肛直肠瘘管，获得了显著的疗效。北京市已经有十多个医院的外科医师向这个小组学习并推行了这种疗法。唐山市气功疗法小组是由唐山市气功疗养所主任刘贵珍和西医师王树彬等组成的。气功疗法是中国民族医学中特有的一种导引治疗方法。刘贵珍本人用气功疗法治愈了胃溃疡后，从一九四九年就开始运用气功疗法为别人治疗消化性溃疡、神经衰弱和胃下垂等疾病，治疗成绩很好。
