Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 2nd: Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese Science Delegation to Japan and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, held a press conference at Tokyo Airport on December 1st. Guo Moruo issued the following statement to reporters:

　　We are visiting Japan for a friendly visit and academic observation at the invitation of the Science Council of Japan. We bring the friendly wishes and blessings of the Chinese academic community and the Chinese people to the Japanese academic community and the Japanese people. We are deeply moved by the warm welcome we have received from people from all walks of life in Japan, and we would like to express our heartfelt thanks here.

　　In the current international environment, the people of China and Japan especially need to live together in peace. China and Japan are neighbors, and the strengthening of friendly relations between our two peoples is not only in the interests of the two peoples, but also helps to maintain peace in Asia and the world. History convincingly proves that estrangement and antagonism in Sino-Japanese relations will never bring any benefits. Only peaceful coexistence and friendly exchanges can bring the greatest benefits to the people of our two countries. Recently, an increasing number of people from Japanese society have visited China, and China has gradually gained more opportunities to visit Japan. This fact is a vivid manifestation of the desire of the people of both countries to live together in peace.

　　We Chinese people have traditional friendly feelings towards the Japanese people. Although Sino-Japanese relations have not yet been normalized, we still have many ways to develop economic and cultural relations between our two peoples. In terms of developing cultural relations, we believe that mutual visits by literary, scientific, and artistic figures from both countries, mutual observation of literary and artistic works, mutual exchange of books and films, mutual exchange of various scientific and technological knowledge, and the establishment of contacts and ties between scientific and cultural groups of the two countries - all these activities will promote friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples on a broad scale.

　　Of course, the people of both countries will feel that the current situation is not satisfactory, because there are still certain obstacles to the development of economic and cultural relations between the two countries. Normal relations have not been established between our two countries, and in fact, there are still people trying to sow seeds of suspicion and discord between the people of China and Japan. The Chinese people hope that, through the unremitting efforts of the people of both countries, these obstacles that violate the will of the people can be eliminated as soon as possible, so as to fully realize the peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation of the people of the two countries under the conditions of normalization of relations between the two countries.

　　We are very pleased to have the opportunity to establish direct contact with people from the Japanese academic community and other fields during this friendly visit and academic observation in Japan, and to better understand the labor and life of the hardworking and brave Japanese people. During the visit, we will convey the friendly wishes of the Chinese people to the Japanese people. We are also willing to learn a lot from the Japanese people and the Japanese academic community. We sincerely hope that this visit will achieve the result of promoting cultural exchanges between China and Japan and enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.

    郭沫若在东京机场向日本报界发表声明
    新华社二日讯　东京消息：中国访日科学代表团团长、中国科学院院长郭沫若十二月一日在东京飞机场举行了记者招待会。郭沫若向记者发表声明如下：
    我们是应日本学术会议的邀请而到日本来进行友好访问和学术视察的。我们带来了中国学术界和中国人民对于日本学术界和日本人民的友好的愿望与祝福。我们受到日本各界人士的热诚欢迎，深切感动，愿在这里表示衷心的感谢。
    在目前的国际环境下，中日两国人民特别需要和平相处。中日两国是近邻，我们两国人民的友好关系的加强，不仅符合两国人民的利益，而且有助于维护亚洲的和世界的和平。历史令人信服地证明，中日两国关系的隔阂和敌对决不会带来任何的好处，只有和平相处，友好往来，才能够使我们两国人民得到最大的利益。最近时期，日本方面有越来越多的社会人士到中国访问，中国方面也逐渐获得更多的机会到日本访问，这个事实就是两国人民对于和平相处的意愿的生动表现。
    我们中国人民对日本人民是有传统的友好感情的。尽管中日两国关系还没有正常化，我们仍然有许多途径来发展两国人民之间的经济和文化的关系。就发展文化关系来说，我们认为，两国文学、科学、艺术界人士的相互访问，文艺作品的相互观摩，书籍、电影的相互交换，各类科学技术知识的相互交流，两国科学文化团体之间的接触和联系的建立，这一切活动都将在广大的范围内增进中日两国人民的友谊。
    当然，我们两国人民彼此都会感到目前的情况还不能令人满意，因为，在发展两国的经济和文化关系方面还存在着某种的障碍。我们两国之间还没有建立正常的关系，而在事实上还仍然有人力图在中日两国人民之间散布猜疑和不和的种子。中国人民希望，由于两国人民的坚持不懈的努力，这种违反人民意愿的障碍能够尽早地被消除，以便在两国关系正常化的条件下，充分实现两国人民的和平共处和友好合作。
    我们这次到日本进行友好访问和学术视察，得到机会同日本学术界和其他方面的广大人士建立直接的接触，并能更好地了解勤劳勇敢的日本人民的劳动和生活，这是很愉快的事。在访问期间，我们要转达中国人民对于日本人民的友好的愿望。同时也愿意从日本人民和日本学术界学到很多东西。我们深切地希望，这次的访问能够获得促进中日两国的文化交流和增进中日两国人民的友谊的结果。
