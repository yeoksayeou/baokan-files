    Vigorous Zhang Guozhuang
    Zhang Ke
    As people enter Zhang Guozhuang Township, they are drawn in by a beautiful rural scene. In the fields, neat rows of brand-new canals crisscross the land, setting off lush wheat seedlings and newly tilled autumn fields. The canals are newly built, and some sections are not yet fully completed, with farmers working hard to finish them. In the villages, farmers are either composting fertilizer or tidying up grain stacks and haystacks. In front of the livestock sheds, under the sunlight, elderly animal caretakers are carefully picking out impurities from the fodder, constantly checking how the livestock are eating. A vibrant scene fills every corner of Zhang Guozhuang Township.

    Zhang Guozhuang Township is located west of the intersection of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Yongding River. The township has approximately nine thousand mu of arable land, distributed across ten natural villages. Except for the mountainous areas in the western villages such as Huaishuling, most of the area is flat land. Since the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives in 1953, the cooperative members have led farmers both inside and outside the cooperatives to practice intensive cultivation and improve techniques. Generally, land yields have increased by 30 to 50 percent compared to the past. Take the main crop, corn, for example. In the past, each mu only produced about 200 jin, but now it has increased to about 300 jin. Although the yield has increased compared to the past, it is still far behind the irrigated land nearby, so farmers are very envious of irrigated land. In the past, some people planned to dig wells by the Yongding River and use waterwheels to draw water from the wells for irrigation. However, due to the scattered land and lack of unity, even such a small-scale irrigation plan could not be realized. This year, because the vast majority of farmers in the township have joined the cooperatives, the land is used uniformly, creating the conditions for digging canals. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry and the Fengtai District People's Committee are planning to build a mechanical pumping irrigation project by the Yongding River, providing technical designs for the irrigation canals to help them realize their dream of turning dry land into irrigated land. Currently, farmers in Zhang Guozhuang and Lugouqiao have built two main canals and more than a dozen branch canals on this land, with the main canals alone stretching for eighteen or nineteen li. It is estimated that next year, Zhang Guozhuang Township alone will be able to irrigate more than 4,000 mu of land, and the yield will increase by at least 30 percent in the first year.

    This spring, the Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative expanded to 600 households. After the autumn harvest, dozens more households applied to join the cooperative. Currently, out of the township's 670 households, all but about ten who are still hesitant and watching have joined the cooperative. Recently, while building the canals, they also carefully studied Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperativization. After studying, the farmers' confidence in taking the socialist road has become more firm, and their enthusiasm for further developing production has become even more abundant. In addition to completing all the wooden and stone works such as culverts on the canals this winter and next spring to ensure timely pumping of water for irrigation next year, they will also fill in several wastewater ditches requiring about 180,000 cubic meters of soil, so that tractors can play a greater role. They also plan to accumulate 17,000 cartloads of fertilizer by the end of March next year, striving to apply half a cartload more fertilizer per mu than last year and harvest ten more jin of grain. In addition, they will organize a group of surplus labor to engage in winter sideline production such as quarrying and transportation, ensuring that there is not a single idle person in the entire cooperative.

    生气勃勃的张郭庄
    张克
    人们一走进张郭庄乡，就被一幅美丽的农村图景引吸住了。田野里，纵横排列一条条崭新的渠道，衬托在渠道当中的是一片片茁壮的麦苗和新耕过的秋地。渠道是才修的，有几处还没全部完工，农民们正在紧张修整。村庄里，农民们有的在沤土肥，有的在整理粮囤草堆，牲畜棚前太阳光下，年老的饲养员在精心地拣去草料中的杂物，还不时查看各槽牲口的吃草情况。生气蓬勃的景象，充满了张郭庄乡的每一个角落。
    张郭庄乡位于京汉铁路和永定河交叉口的西边，全乡约有九千亩耕地，分布在十个自然村里，内中除西部槐树岭等村有山地外，其余大部都是平地。这里从一九五三年建立农业生产合作社以来，社员带动社外农民实行精耕细作，改良技术，土地产量一般都比过去增加了百分之三十到五十。拿主要农作物玉米来说，过去每亩只产二百斤左右，现在已经增加到三百来斤。产量虽比过去有所增加，但比起附近的水浇地还差得很多，因而农民们对水浇地非常羡慕。过去曾有人打算在永定河边上挖过水井，再用水车从井内车水浇地，但是因为土地分散、人心不齐，即使是像这样规模很小的灌溉计划也没法实现。今年由于全乡绝大部分农民都参加了合作社，土地统一使用，具备了开渠的条件。北京市农林局和丰台区人民委员会便在永定河边筹建一处机械扬水灌溉工程，对灌溉渠道进行了技术设计，帮助他们实现旱地改水地的愿望。现在，张郭庄和芦沟桥的农民，在这块土地上已修筑了两条干渠和十几条支渠，其中干渠的长度就有十八、九里。预计明年仅张郭庄乡即可浇地四千多亩，头一年至少能提高产量三成左右。
    张郭庄农业生产合作社，今年春天就发展到六百户，秋收以后又有几十户报名要求入社，目前全乡六百七十多户人家中，除有十来户还在犹豫观望外，其余都入了社。最近他们一面修渠一面又细致地学习了毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示，经过学习，农民们走社会主义道路的信心更坚定，进一步发展生产的劲头更充足了。他们在今冬明春除要做好渠道上所有涵闸等木石工程，保证明年能及时抽水浇地外，还要填平约需十八万方土的几条废水沟，以便拖拉机能发挥更大的作用。他们还计划到明年三月底，要积肥一万七千车，争取每亩地比去年多施半车肥，多收十斤粮食。另外，还将组织一批剩余劳动力，进行挖石子、运输等冬季副业生产，做到全社没有一个闲人。
