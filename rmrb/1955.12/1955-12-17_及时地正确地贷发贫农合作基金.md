    Timely and Correct Issuance of Poor Peasant Cooperative Funds
    Sun Zunian
    Agricultural cooperatives are developing rapidly in Jiangxi Province, but the work of issuing poor peasant cooperative fund loans has not kept pace. Because many areas have not combined the work of establishing, expanding, and rectifying cooperatives with the timely issuance of poor peasant cooperative funds, only 31.5 percent of the province's poor peasant cooperative funds have been issued to date. Xin建, Shanggao, Wanzai, Shangyou, and Guangchang counties have not issued a single loan for several months. In Nanchang County, poor peasants who are hesitant to request to join cooperatives because of difficulties with their share funds account for 24 percent of the poor peasants outside the cooperatives.
    Some areas, although they have issued the loans, have not correctly implemented the policies. For example, some areas have distributed the poor peasant cooperative fund loans to cooperatives level by level, with a deadline for issuance, resulting in some who should not have been loaned to being loaned to, and some who should have been loaned to not being loaned to. Changsheng District in Ningdu County distributed the poor peasant cooperative fund loans to agricultural production cooperatives without investigation. Chen Zhaohua, the head of the Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative in this county, only owed 38 yuan for his share fund but received a loan of 75 yuan. The Second Agricultural Cooperative of Xialuo Township in Ruijin County extracted 45 yuan from a 140 yuan poor peasant cooperative fund loan to distribute to members for pocket money or to repay private debts. Some areas lack strict review of the loan recipients, so that middle peasants who do not meet the loan conditions also receive cooperative funds. Among the seven households in the Second Agricultural Cooperative of Linghe Township in Chongyi County that received cooperative funds, three were middle peasants. Similar situations exist in other areas.
    Why are the issuance of poor peasant cooperative fund loans untimely and unreasonable? The main reason is that some county and district party and government leaders do not fully recognize the important role of these loans and have not provided the necessary guidance and supervision for this work. Some county and district leaders mistakenly believe that "agricultural cooperatives were established in the past without this type of loan," and one-sidedly believe that this is a matter for the bank and they can ignore it. If the leaders do not pay attention, many bank staff will not pay attention either. Some bank staff in Ningdu County blindly allocate the numbers of poor peasant cooperative funds while sitting in the township people's committees, and some even simply push this work to credit cooperatives. How can such a work style achieve the requirements of "more loans for those with more shortages, fewer loans for those with fewer shortages, and no loans for those with no shortages"?
    Poor peasant cooperative fund loans are a powerful assistance given by the Party and the government to poor peasants. Correctly issuing these loans can not only help poor peasants overcome the difficulties of paying the share funds to join the cooperatives, and improve the economic and political status of poor peasants within the cooperatives, but also avoid harming the interests of middle peasants, further strengthen the unity of poor and middle peasants, and promote the consolidation and development of cooperatives. Therefore, local party committees must list this work as part of the agricultural cooperativization work, make unified arrangements, and conduct regular inspections to identify problems and correct them in a timely manner. District committees and township party branches must strengthen specific leadership to truly ensure that poor peasant cooperative fund loans are loaned reasonably and used properly. Under the leadership of the party committees, local banks should conduct in-depth investigations and research, and issue poor peasant cooperative fund loans in a timely and correct manner.

    及时地正确地贷发贫农合作基金
    孙祖年
    江西省农业合作社正在大量地发展，但是，发放贫农合作基金贷款的工作没有跟上去。由于许多地区没有结合建社、扩社、整社的工作，及时贷发贫农合作基金，到目前为止，全省贫农合作基金只发放了百分之三十一点五。新建、上高、万载、上犹、广昌等县，几个月来竟未贷出分文。南昌县因为入社股份基金发生困难而不敢提出入社要求的贫农，就占社外贫农的百分之二十四。
    有些地区虽然把贷款发下去了，但是没有正确地贯彻执行政策。例如，有的地区把贫农合作基金贷款层层分配到社，限期贷发，结果产生了不应贷的贷了，而应贷的未贷到的现象。宁都县长胜区没有经过调查，就把贫农合作基金贷款分配到农业生产合作社。这个县的胜利农业生产合作社社长陈召华，只欠入社股份基金三十八元，却贷到了七十五元。瑞金县下罗乡第二农业合作社从一百四十元贫农合作基金贷款中，抽出四十五元分给社员零用或偿还私人债款。有些地区对于贷放对象缺乏严格审查，以致不合贷款条件的中农也贷到合作基金。崇义县岭河乡第二农业社贷到合作基金的七户中，就有三户是中农。其他地区也有类似情况。
    为什么会造成发放贫农合作基金贷款不及时、不合理的现象呢？主要原因是有些县、区的党和政府领导人员对这项贷款的重要作用认识不足，没有对于这项工作给予必要的指导和监督。有的县、区负责人员错误地认为“过去没有这种贷款，也办了农业合作社”，并且片面地认为这是银行的事，自己可以不闻不问。领导人员不重视，许多银行工作人员也就不重视了。宁都县有些银行工作人员就坐在乡人民委员会盲目地分配贫农合作基金的数字，有的甚至把这项工作简单地推给信用合作社代办。这样的工作作风，怎么能实现“多缺多贷，少缺少贷，不缺不贷”的要求呢？
    贫农合作基金贷款是党和政府给予贫农的一项有力的援助。正确地发放这项贷款，既可帮助贫农克服缴纳入社股份资金的困难，提高贫农在社内的经济地位和政治地位，又可避免损害中农利益，进一步加强贫、中农的团结，促进合作社的巩固和发展。因此，各地党委必须把这项工作列为农业合作化工作的一部分，加以统一布置，经常进行检查，发现问题，及时纠正。区委和乡的党支部更要加强具体领导，真正做到使贫农合作基金贷款贷得合理，用得正当。各地银行应该在党委领导下，深入调查研究，把贫农合作基金贷款及时地、正确地发放下去。
