    Introducing Several Ways to Eat Sweet Potatoes
    To the Editor:
    I strongly support the call in the newspaper to use sweet potatoes as a substitute for grain. Sweet potatoes are indeed a very good food. In the areas of Jiaozhou, Wendeng, and Linyi in Shandong Province, sweet potatoes have always been the main food for farmers. They have many ways of eating sweet potatoes. Now, I will select some simple ways to introduce to everyone.
    In addition to steaming, boiling, roasting, or mixing fresh sweet potatoes into congee or rice, there are several more refined ways to eat them: Grate the sweet potatoes into thin shreds and mix them into wheat flour or corn flour to steam; after steaming sweet potato slices until half-cooked, cut them into strips or small pieces, dry them in the sun, and then stir-fry them. They taste sweet and crunchy and can be given to children as snacks; sweet potatoes can be cut into thin shreds and stir-fried with oil, salt, scallions, and vinegar. The taste is crisp, sweet, fragrant, and sour, no less delicious than lotus root shreds. Some farmers, for the sake of convenience, steam and store large piles of sweet potatoes. This can convert some of the starch in the sweet potatoes into sugar, which also tastes very good.
    Sweet potatoes can also be cut into strips or pieces, dried in the sun, crushed, and sifted into sweet potato flour. Sweet potato flour can be used to make dumplings (the dough should be softened), noodles (needs to be mixed with one-fifth of soybean flour or wheat flour), pancakes (the dough should be hardened), and steamed buns (first use one-fifth of wheat flour as a starter to ferment); sweet potato flour mixed with a small amount of wheat flour can also be fermented and made into various pastries or fried cakes.

### 介绍几种吃甘薯的方法

    介绍几种吃甘薯的方法编辑同志：
    报纸上提出了以薯代粮的号召，我很拥护。甘薯确是一种很好的食品。在山东省胶州、文登、临沂等专区，甘薯一直是农民的主要食粮。他们吃甘薯的方法是多种多样的，现在我选择一部分吃法简单地介绍给大家。
    新鲜的甘薯，除了蒸、煮、烤或掺在稀饭、干饭里吃以外，还有几种比较细致的吃法：把甘薯擦成细丝，掺在白面或玉米面里蒸着吃；把甘薯切片蒸成半熟以后，再切成条或小块，晒干后炒熟了吃，味道香甜干脆，可以给小孩当零食；甘薯切成细丝，加油、盐、葱、醋烹炒作菜，味道脆甜香酸，不次于藕丝。有些农户为了一劳永逸，把大堆甘薯都蒸熟了贮藏起来，这可以使甘薯中的一部分淀粉变成糖质，味道也很好。
    甘薯还可以切成条或块，晒干后轧碎筛过成为甘薯面。甘薯面可以包饺子（面要烫软些），做面条（需要掺五分之一的豆面或白面），烙单饼（面要烫硬些），蒸馍馍（先用五分之一的白面作引子发酵）；甘薯面掺少量白面发酵后，还可以做成各种点心或油炸糕。
