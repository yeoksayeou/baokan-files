　　Xinhua News Agency, December 29th. The state-owned coal industry had already completed the annual state coal production plan by the 24th, exceeding the plan by more than 30,000 tons of coal. Compared with 1954, the national state-owned coal mine production increased by 17.7 percent. More than 50 percent of the state-owned coal mines have completed their annual coal production plans ahead of schedule, with Fushun, Fuxin, Huainan, Jiaozuo, and Jixi coal mines exceeding the most.
　　Based on the implementation of new coal mining methods, national state-owned coal mines continued to implement comprehensive production reforms this year, established a chief engineer system and improved the leadership duty system, strengthened geological surveying, and promoted the advanced experience of regular cyclical operations, all of which played a significant role in improving coal mine production levels.
　　Xinhua News Agency, December 29th. The Iron and Steel Industry Bureau system of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has completed its annual production plan for five major products ahead of schedule, with steel and iron ore ahead of schedule by 23 days, and pig iron, steel, and metallurgical coke ahead of schedule by eight to twenty days. Currently, more than 70 percent of the enterprises in the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau have fully completed the annual production plan for these five major products.
　　The total output value of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau system is expected to increase by 19.3 percent compared to last year, and the output of pig iron, steel, steel products, iron ore, and metallurgical coke is expected to increase by 5 to 34 percent compared to last year.
　　This year, enterprises affiliated with the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau have planned and focused on promoting several advanced experiences of great significance. In iron smelting, the advanced experiences of "ore blending," "furnace top adjustment," and "steam blowing" were continued this year, effectively improving the production technology level of blast furnaces. From January to November, the average effective volume of blast furnace occupied per ton of pig iron produced by the entire Bureau system decreased by 2.6 percent compared to last year. In open-hearth steelmaking, advanced technologies such as "thick-layer sintering repair" and "rapid cold repair" were promoted this year, which greatly reduced the cold and hot repair time of open-hearth furnaces and improved the utilization factor of open-hearth furnaces. From January to November, the daily steel production per square meter of open-hearth furnace bottom area of the entire Bureau system increased by 20.5 percent compared to last year. In addition, in converters, electric furnaces, and steel rolling, as well as in non-ferrous metal mining and coke oven coking, many advanced technical experiences have also been promoted this year.

    国营煤炭工业超额完成全年煤炭生产计划
    钢铁局系统完成五种主要产品全年计划
    新华社二十九日讯　国营煤炭工业到二十四日止已经完成了全年国家产煤计划，并且超额生产了三万多吨煤。同一九五四年比较，全国国营煤矿产煤量增加了百分之十七点七。有百分之五十以上的国营煤矿都已经提前完成了全年产煤计划，其中超额最多的有抚顺、阜新、淮南、焦作、鸡西等煤矿。
    全国国营煤矿在实行新采煤方法的基础上，今年继续贯彻了全面生产改革，建立了总工程师制和健全了领导值班制，并且加强了地质测量工作，推广了正规循环作业的先进经验，这些对提高煤矿生产水平都起了很大作用。
    新华社二十九日讯　重工业部钢铁工业管理局系统有五种主要产品已经提前完成了年度生产计划，其中钢和铁矿石提前了二十三天，生铁、钢材和冶金焦炭提前了八天到二十天。目前，钢铁工业管理局百分之七十以上的企业都全面完成了这五种主要产品的年度生产计划。
    钢铁工业管理局系统今年生产总值预计将比去年增长百分之十九点三，生铁、钢、钢材、铁矿石和冶金焦炭的产量预计将比去年增长百分之五到百分之三十四。
    钢铁工业管理局所属企业今年有计划有重点地推广了若干具有重大意义的先进经验。在炼铁方面，今年继续推行了“矿石混匀”、“炉顶调剂”、“蒸汽鼓风”等先进经验，有效地提高了高炉的生产技术水平。从一月到十一月，全管理局系统平均每炼一吨生铁所占用的高炉有效容积比去年减少了百分之二点六。平炉炼钢方面，今年推广了“厚层烧补”、“快速冷修”等先进技术，使平炉冷修和热修时间大大减少，并且提高了平炉利用系数。从一月到十一月，全管理局系统每平方公尺平炉炉底面积每昼夜产钢量比去年提高了百分之二十点五。此外，在转炉、电炉和轧钢方面，以及在黑色金属矿山采矿和焦炉炼焦方面，今年也都推广了很多先进技术经验。
