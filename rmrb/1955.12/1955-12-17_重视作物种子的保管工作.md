Attach Importance to the Storage of Crop Seeds
    Zeng Guanhui

    The quality of seeds is directly related to the growth and yield of crops. Doing a good job in seed storage is one of the important measures to ensure increased agricultural production. In seed storage, we must first prevent the mixing of seeds, moisture regain, heat generation, and insect pests. Because mixed seeds will greatly affect crop yields; seeds that regain moisture and generate heat have low germination rates and fewer seedlings, which will result in missing seedlings and broken ridges; as for insect-infested and moldy seeds, of course, they cannot be sown at all.

    In recent years, the development of agricultural production has urgently demanded improvements in seed quality; however, seed storage work has not been able to adapt to this growing need. In particular, due to the rapid increase in agricultural production cooperatives, seed storage has changed from dispersed storage by individual households to centralized storage, and the amount and variety of seeds stored centrally are large. Therefore, doing a good job in seed storage is even more important at present and in the future. Now is the season for winter harvesting and storage, and how to store seeds well is an issue that all regions should pay close attention to.

    Grain storage departments store a large number of seeds for the country, and the quality of the storage of so many seeds has a great impact on agricultural production. However, some grain storage workers treat seed storage the same as grain storage, believing that they have done a good job in storing a large amount of grain in the past, and that there will be no problems in storing these seeds now. It is precisely because people do not pay enough attention to seed storage that some grain depots store various seeds together, and some grain depots supply seeds as grain; some grain depots do not pay attention to seed inspection and turning, resulting in a decrease in seed germination rate. Last year, the seeds supplied to farmers by the Nanmeng Grain Station in Ba County, Hebei Province, mostly failed to germinate. The Huangmaya, Baimaya, Jinhuanghou, and other fine corn varieties stored in the Chengguan Warehouse of Luoning County, Henan Province, were jointly inspected by the agricultural technology promotion station and grain depot staff before entering the warehouse and packaged separately; however, the custodians only stored them according to their yellow and white skins, mixing summer-sown and spring-sown varieties together; during the Spring Festival, they supplied the fine varieties to the masses as commercial grain; and when summer planting came this year, they supplied spring-sown corn as summer-sown corn, and some people only discovered this situation after sowing the seeds in the ground.

    Some state-owned farms also do not pay enough attention to seed storage. For example, some staff believe that the farm lacks funds and personnel, and it is difficult to guarantee seed quality without a dedicated seed warehouse. Others believe that there is no great technology in seed storage and do not pay enough attention to seed storage work. The fine rice seeds stored by the Jianglexian Farm in Fujian Province were not labeled, so that ten packages of fine varieties and seven packages of local varieties were mixed up and supplied to the masses, causing losses to their production. More than 110,000 jin of "Cooperative No. 2" and other fine wheat varieties bred by the Ning'an County Farm in Heilongjiang Province had very low germination rates due to the farm's failure to pay attention to inspection and turning, and this year's wheat fine variety breeding plan failed.

    Some agricultural production cooperatives have also failed to do a good job in seed storage. For example, some cooperative staff said: The cooperative has a large number of seeds, and it is difficult to store them without a seed warehouse. Is it true that some agricultural cooperatives that do not have seed warehouse facilities for the time being have no way to store seeds well? Experience has shown that if the leaders of the cooperative attach importance to seed storage work and mobilize the committee and members to find ways, the seeds can be stored well. Many cooperatives only hand over the seeds to the custodians, and the cooperative has not established a set of seed storage regulations, which of course cannot guarantee the quality of the seeds. In 1954, 50,000 jin of fine wheat seeds purchased and stored by the Hongxing Collective Farm in the suburbs of Beijing became moldy and deteriorated due to poor storage, and all of them could not be used as seeds.

    Facts have proved that as long as we attach importance to seed storage work ideologically, we can guarantee seed quality. In 1954, the wheat seeds stored by the Erlongshan Farm in Heilongjiang Province were divided into sections and grades for storage by the threshing ground director, and regular inspections were organized, and the seed quality was very good. This year, the Liling County Grain Bureau in Hunan Province stored more than 3.7 million jin of rice seeds, and the mixing of seeds was prevented by storing them in different warehouses according to different varieties. The good experience of seed storage should be promptly summarized and promoted by grain departments and agricultural departments in various places.

    重视作物种子的保管工作
    曾观惠
    种子质量好坏，直接关系庄稼的生长和收成。做好种子保管工作，是保证农业增产的重要措施之一。在种子保管工作中首先要防止种子的混杂、回潮发热和虫害现象的发生。因为混杂的种子，会大大地影响庄稼的产量；回潮发热的种子，发芽率低，出苗少，会造成缺苗断垅的恶果；至于生虫、霉烂的种子，当然更是根本不能播种。
    近几年来，农业生产的发展，迫切要求改善种子的质量；但是，种子保管工作不能适应这种日益增长的需要。特别是由于农业生产合作社的迅速增加，由一家一户分散保管种子变为集中保管，而且集中保管的种子数量大、品种多。所以在目前和今后，做好种子保管工作就更加重要了。现在正是冬收冬藏的季节，如何把种子保管得好，是各个地区都应该十分注意的一个问题。
    粮食保管部门为国家保管大量种子，这么多的种子保管得好坏，对于农业生产的影响是很大的。但是有些粮食保管工作人员把保管种子和保管粮食一样对待，认为过去保管大量粮食，工作做得还不错，现在保管这点种子，不会有问题。正由于人们对保管种子不重视，有的粮库把各类种子混杂在一起保管了，有的粮库把种子当粮食供应了；有的粮库不注意种子的检查翻晒，使得种子发芽率降低。去年河北霸县南孟粮站供给农民的种子，大部分不能出苗。河南洛宁县城关仓库储备的黄马牙、白马牙、金黄后等玉米良种，在入仓前都经过农业技术推广站和粮库工作人员共同检验，分别包装的；但是保管员只按照黄白皮色来保管，把夏播的春播的混杂在一起；到春节的时候，又把良种当商品粮供应给群众；今年夏种的时候，又把春播的玉米当夏播玉米供应出去，有些群众已将种子播种到地里，才发现这种情况。
      有些国营农场也不重视种子保管工作。例如有的工作人员就认为场内经费缺，人员少，没有专门的种子仓库，难以保证种子质量。有的则认为保管种子没有什么大技术，对种子的保管工作不重视。福建省将乐县农场保管的水稻良种，不设标签，以致后来把十包良种和七包土种混合起来，供应给群众，使群众的生产受到损失。黑龙江省宁安县农场繁殖出来的“合作二号”等小麦良种十一万多斤，由于农场不重视检查翻晒，发芽率很低，今年小麦良种繁殖计划落空。
    有些农业生产合作社也没有认真地做好种子保管工作。例如有的合作社工作人员说：社内种子数量大，又没有种子仓库，保管很困难。有些农业合作社暂时没有种子仓库的设备，是不是就没有办法来把种子保管好呢？经验证明，如果合作社的领导人员重视种子保管工作，发动社委和社员群众想办法，是可以把种子保管好的。许多社只把种子交给保管员，社内又没有定出一套保管种子的制度，这当然不可能保证种子的质量。一九五四年，北京市郊红星集体农庄购储的五万斤小麦良种，因为保管不好发霉变质，全部不能作种子。
    事实证明，只要思想上重视种子的保管工作，就可以保证种子质量。一九五四年国营黑龙江省二龙山农场保管的麦种，由晒场场长负责把麦种分地段分等级入库，定期组织检查，种子质量很好。今年湖南醴陵县粮食局储存稻种三百七十多万斤，由于按照不同品种分仓储放，就防止了种子的混杂。对保管种子的好经验，各地粮食部门和农业部门应该及时注意总结和推广。
