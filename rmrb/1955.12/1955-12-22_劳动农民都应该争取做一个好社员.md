    Laboring Peasants Should Strive to Be Good Cooperative Members
    He Cheng
    Joining an agricultural production cooperative is not only seen as a beneficial thing by many peasants but also considered a glorious thing. Many peasants, after joining the cooperative, happily and excitedly tell their relatives and friends: "I am already a cooperative member!" Many girls, when looking for a "partner," first inquire: "Is he a cooperative member?" A cooperative member, of course, is not a special person and does not have any special privileges in society. However, people naturally regard a cooperative member as a glorious title. When people say the word "cooperative member," it contains meanings such as: a person who lives a happy life, a person with progressive ideas, and a person who walks ahead on the road of socialism. After joining the cooperative, one should certainly not look down on the laboring peasants who have not yet joined, should not think of oneself as "a cut above," and should not make sarcastic remarks to those who have not yet joined, nor should one bully any non-cooperative peasants. However, joining the cooperative is, after all, somewhat different from not joining: one has become a member of the glorious collective family, and in this big family, one has sacred rights to enjoy and glorious obligations to fulfill.
      What Rights Do Cooperative Members Have?
    Some peasants feel that joining the cooperative means "having to listen to others in everything." This is a wrong view. Many clauses in the draft model regulations for agricultural production cooperatives can dispel this view. Especially Article 13, which clearly stipulates the rights that each cooperative member can enjoy in the cooperative.
    The first right is "to participate in labor within the cooperative and receive due remuneration." Some people with strong labor power fear that joining the cooperative will prevent them from doing more work and earning more workdays, which is not as good as doing odd jobs for others outside the cooperative and earning more wages. Some people with weak labor power fear that joining the cooperative will mean not having suitable work to do and not being able to earn labor remuneration, making it difficult to maintain their livelihood. Knowing that there is such a provision, there is no need to "fear" anymore. Every cooperative member has the right to participate in labor and receive remuneration in the cooperative. No matter who it is, it is illegal to infringe upon this right of a cooperative member in any way.
    The second right is "to participate in cooperative affairs, make suggestions and criticisms regarding cooperative affairs, and supervise cooperative affairs; to elect the leaders of the cooperative and to be elected as the leaders of the cooperative; to hold positions in the cooperative." This means that the "big affairs" of the whole cooperative are not managed solely by the leaders of the cooperative, but every cooperative member has the right to manage them; the leaders of the cooperative are not "appointed" by anyone, but elected by all the cooperative members; every cooperative member has the right to be elected as the leader of the cooperative; every cooperative member has the right to hold a position in the cooperative. Of course, this does not mean that every cooperative member can casually interfere in the affairs of the cooperative; that would cause chaos. It means that every cooperative member, as long as they are fair, capable, actively willing to work for the cooperative, and supported by the majority of cooperative members, will be elected by the cooperative members as leaders such as the cooperative director, management committee member, and supervisory committee member, and can be appointed by the management committee as staff members such as accountants, cashiers, custodians, technicians, and production team leaders. Fair and capable people will never be buried in the cooperative. Those who have not been elected as leaders or staff members can also express their opinions on various matters of the cooperative at the members' meeting or at any time—suggestions or criticisms are both acceptable; the leaders of the cooperative are not allowed to ignore these opinions, and even more, are not allowed to retaliate against those who make suggestions or deliberately "make things difficult" for cooperative members who like to make suggestions when assigning work. Making suggestions is the right of every cooperative member, and no one is allowed to infringe upon this right.
    The third right is "to engage in household sideline occupations without hindering participation in cooperative labor." Joining the cooperative does not mean that one cannot do anything other than work in the cooperative, and that all sideline occupations suitable for each household (such as raising chickens, raising pigs, and some handicrafts, etc.) must be considered as sideline occupations of the cooperative. As long as one guarantees to work enough of the number of workdays agreed upon by everyone in the cooperative, especially when the farm work in the cooperative is busy, without hindering participation in cooperative labor, cooperative members can engage in their own household sideline occupations. This is a right that cooperative members should have, and the leaders of the cooperative should not only allow cooperative members to engage in household sideline occupations under such conditions but also encourage and help cooperative members to do so.
    The fourth right is "to enjoy the benefits of various public undertakings organized by the cooperative." This means that every cooperative member can enjoy the benefits of various production and cultural welfare undertakings organized by the cooperative, according to the methods agreed upon by everyone. Non-cooperative members cannot enjoy these benefits.
    What Obligations Do Cooperative Members Have?
    Some peasants think that joining the cooperative means "not having to worry about anything oneself." This idea is also incorrect. One cannot only enjoy rights and not fulfill obligations! Article 14 of the draft model regulations clearly stipulates the obligations that each cooperative member should fulfill in the cooperative.
    The first obligation is "to abide by the cooperative's regulations; to implement the resolutions of the members' meeting and the management committee." The cooperative's regulations and the resolutions of the members' meeting are discussed and adopted by the members' meeting, and all cooperative members should abide by and follow them; the management committee is elected by the members' meeting, and all cooperative members should also abide by and follow its resolutions. Can the minority of cooperative members who did not agree or raise their hands when passing the resolutions not abide by or follow them? No. If they do not agree, they can still make suggestions after the resolutions are passed, and if everyone agrees with these suggestions, they can be revised at the next meeting. However, before the resolutions are revised, every cooperative member must abide by them and follow them.
    The second obligation is "to abide by the cooperative's labor discipline; to complete the work tasks assigned to them on time." The cooperative's labor discipline is also agreed upon by all the cooperative members, and it is for the purpose of protecting the interests of all cooperative members. China's Constitution also stipulates that every citizen must abide by labor discipline. If cooperative members want to participate in the cooperative's labor or not, and if they want to do whatever they want when participating in the cooperative's labor, without doing the work well or completing it on time, the cooperative will suffer losses. If the cooperative suffers losses, it means that every cooperative member suffers losses.
    The third obligation is "to cherish the property of the state, the property owned in common by the entire cooperative, and the property owned privately by cooperative members but given to the cooperative for common use." Cherishing and protecting public property is the obligation of every citizen, which is clearly stipulated in China's Constitution. State property is shared by all the people of the country, especially the property of agricultural machinery stations, which is directly related to the interests of cooperative members; the property owned in common by the entire cooperative is the foundation for the development of production and cultural welfare undertakings; the means of production owned privately but used in common are also closely related to the development of the entire cooperative's production; everyone cherishing these properties is also closely related to the unity within the cooperative and the consolidation of the cooperative; if there are losses, the cooperative must compensate the original owner, which is also a loss for every cooperative member. Therefore, no one is allowed to destroy or seize, steal public property and privately owned property for public use, and everyone must cherish these properties.
    The fourth obligation is "to consolidate the unity of the entire cooperative and wage a resolute struggle against all activities that undermine the cooperative." If the cooperative is not united, nothing can be done well; if the situation is serious, the cooperative may collapse. The leaders of the cooperative must unite closely, and all cooperative members must also unite closely. Whoever undermines unity is not a good cooperative member. Undermining unity is a kind of behavior that undermines the cooperative. Every cooperative member has the responsibility to strengthen the unity of the entire cooperative and prevent and correct situations of disunity. Of course, there are other activities that undermine the cooperative, especially the destructive activities from landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, and every cooperative member should pay attention to them. Embezzlement, theft, etc., are also activities that undermine the cooperative. Every cooperative member, as soon as they discover these situations that undermine the cooperative, should bring them up, to the supervisory committee, the management committee, or to the members' meeting, or tell the Party and the government.
    Who Can Be a Cooperative Member?
    Can just anyone be a member of an agricultural production cooperative? Since cooperative members have many glorious rights and obligations, and since agricultural production cooperatives are collective economic organizations of laboring peasants, and since the purpose of running cooperatives is to gradually eliminate exploitation and develop socialist agricultural economy, then absolutely not just anyone can be absorbed, nor does just anyone have the ability to be a cooperative member. Joining the cooperative is voluntary, and whoever does not want to join can not join; but it is not free, not whoever wants to join can join. The draft model regulations stipulate: male and female laboring peasants who have reached the age of sixteen, or other laboring people who can participate in cooperative labor (such as handicraft laborers and accounting personnel), who voluntarily apply to join the cooperative, can become a cooperative member only after being approved by the members' meeting. Not only do we not accept rich peasants into the cooperative, but we must also educate cooperative members to prevent and combat the destructive activities of rich peasants against the cooperative at all times. Within a few years of a cooperative being first established, former landlord elements and rich peasant elements who have now changed their status will also not be accepted for the time being. When the cooperative has been consolidated, and more than three-quarters of the laboring peasants in the county and township have joined the cooperative, former landlord elements who have changed their status according to the law, and rich peasant elements who have abandoned exploitation for many years, can be accepted into the cooperative one by one; when accepting them into the cooperative, not only must they be reviewed and approved by the members' meeting, but they must also be reviewed and approved by the county-level people's committee. The draft model regulations also stipulate: those who have been deprived of their political rights are not accepted into the cooperative (excluding their family members). These regulations are to protect the cooperative from being undermined and to protect the interests of all cooperative members. Why must they be absorbed one by one even when they can be absorbed? This is because, among these people, there are those who have undergone long-term labor, have always been honest and law-abiding, and have been relatively well reformed; there are those who have undergone labor reform, but have not yet been well reformed; and there are also those who have never been honest, law-abiding laborers. Only the first kind can be absorbed. The second kind can be allowed to participate in the cooperative's labor, but are not considered cooperative members. The third kind must be resolutely prevented from participating, and can be assigned to strong, well-established cooperatives for control.
    Apart from these people, laboring peasants who want to join the cooperative must not be prevented from joining. The draft model regulations stipulate: it is not allowed to restrict poor peasants from joining the cooperative, nor is it allowed to exclude middle peasants from joining the cooperative (this of course includes upper-middle peasants, as long as they are indeed willing to join the cooperative, they should not be excluded); it is also stipulated: we must actively absorb demobilized soldiers, families of martyrs, families of servicemen, families of state organ staff, and immigrants from other places into the cooperative, and we must plan to absorb the old, weak, widowed, and orphaned who can participate in auxiliary labor into the cooperative. Some peasant households lack means of production or have weak labor power, and some cooperatives are afraid of "carrying burdens" and do not want them to join the cooperative; in fact, the cooperative's production must continue to develop, and multiple economies must be developed, the more labor power the better, even if it is half labor power, or even less than half labor power, they can play a significant role in the cooperative. One of the important purposes of running cooperatives is to gradually eliminate exploitation and make all peasants prosperous together; leaving these households outside the cooperative to be exploited by others violates the purpose of running cooperatives.
    Why must one be sixteen years old to be a cooperative member? Generally speaking, one must be sixteen years old to have the ability to exercise the rights of a cooperative member and fulfill the obligations of a cooperative member. What if one is under sixteen years old but can participate in the cooperative's labor? They can be allowed to participate in labor, and they will be given labor remuneration in the same way as cooperative members, according to the amount and quality of their labor.
    Can one withdraw from the cooperative? Yes. Joining the cooperative is not something that anyone can do if they want to, but withdrawing from the cooperative is something that anyone can do if they want to. If one wants to withdraw from the cooperative, will the land, things, and money that were brought into the cooperative be returned? Yes. How will they be returned? It is stipulated very reasonably and clearly in the draft model regulations, and it is clear at a glance. Can one withdraw at any time? No, that cannot be done. Doing so would hinder the production of the entire cooperative and would not be convenient for accounting. Generally speaking, one can only withdraw at the end of the production year (generally after the autumn harvest in most areas).
    It is indeed glorious to be a cooperative member, and it is even more glorious to be a good cooperative member. Peasants who have not yet joined the cooperative, you are welcome to be a cooperative member! Peasants who have already joined the cooperative, I wish you all to be very good cooperative members!

    劳动农民都应该争取做一个好社员
    何成
    参加农业生产合作社，不但已经被许许多多农民看到是有利的事情，也被大家认为是一件光荣的事情。许多农民入社以后又欢喜又兴奋地告诉自己的亲戚朋友：“我已经是个社员啦！”很多姑娘找
  “对象”的时候，都要先探听清楚：“他是不是社员？”社员，当然不是什么特殊的人物，在社会上也没有任何的特权，可是，人们很自然地把社员当成了一个光荣的称号。人们在说到“社员”这个词儿的时候，包含着这样的意思：是过幸福生活的人，是思想进步的人，是在社会主义的道路上走在前边的人。入了社，当然不应该看不起还没有入社的劳动农民，不应该把自己看得“高人一头”，更不应该对暂时还没有入社的人说风凉话，不应该欺负任何一个社外农民。可是，入了社，毕竟是同没有入社的人有些不一样了：成了集体的光荣的大家庭里的一分子，在这个大家庭里有自己应当享受的神圣的权利，有自己应当尽到的光荣的义务。
      社员有些什么权利
    有些农民觉得，加入合作社就要“什么也得听别人管”。这是一种错误的看法。农业生产合作社示范章程草案上规定的很多条文，都可以打破这种看法。特别是在第十三条，明明白白地规定了每个社员在合作社里都能够享到的权利。
    头一种权利是“参加社内的劳动，取得应得的报酬”。有些劳动力强的人怕入了社不能多干活，不能多得劳动日，还不如在社外给人家做些零活多得工钱。有些劳动力弱的人怕入了社没有合适的活干，分不到劳动报酬，顾不住生活。知道有这样一条规定，就不必再“怕”了。每个社员在社里都有参加劳动、取得报酬的权利。不管是谁，不管用什么方式侵犯社员这种权利，都是犯法的。
    第二种权利是“参加社务活动，提出有关社务的建议和批评，对社务进行监督。选举合作社的领导人员和被选为合作社的领导人员。担任合作社的职务”。这就是说：全社的“大家务”，并不只是由社里的领导人员管的，而是每个社员都有权利来管；社里的领导人员也不是任何人“指定”的，而是全体社员选举的；每个社员都有权利被选做社里的领导人员；每个社员都有权利担任社里的职务。当然，这并不是说每个社员对社里的事情都可以随便插手；那样就会搞乱。这是说：每个社员，只要自己办事公道，很有能耐，对社里的事积极肯干，受到大多数社员的拥护，社员就会选举他们做社主任、管理委员、监察委员等领导人员，就能被管理委员会任用做会计员、出纳员、保管员、技术员、生产队长等等工作人员。公道能干的人，在合作社里决不会被埋没。没被大家选做领导人员、工作人员的人，也能在社员大会上或者随便什么时候对社里的各种事情提出自己的意见——建议或者是批评都可以；不允许社里的领导人员对这些意见不听不理，更不允许打击提意见的人，不允许在分派工作的时候故意给爱提意见的社员“穿小鞋”。提意见是每个社员的权利，谁也不许侵犯这个权利。
    第三种权利是“在不妨碍参加合作社劳动的条件下，经营家庭副业”。加入了合作社，决不是说除了合作社里的工作以外，别的什么事都不能做了，都得把适合各家各户自己干的副业（像养鸡，养猪和一些手工业等等）算做社里的副业。只要保证在合作社里做够社里大伙商量定的一定数目的劳动日，特别是在社里的农活正紧的时候不妨碍参加社里的劳动，社员都可以经营自己的家庭副业。这是社员应有的权利，社里的领导人员不但应该许可社员在这样的条件下经营家庭副业，还应该鼓励和帮助社员做这种事情。
    第四种权利是“享受合作社举办的各项公共事业的利益”。这就是说：社里举办的各种生产事业和文化福利事业的好处，每个社员都可以按照大伙商量好的办法享受到。不是社员，就享受不到。
    社员有些什么义务
    有些农民认为加入合作社就是“什么也不用自己操心啦”。这想法也不对。不能光享权利不尽义务啊！示范章程草案第十四条清清楚楚地规定了每个社员在社里都应该尽到的义务。
    头一种义务是“遵守社章。执行社员大会和管理委员会的决议”。社章和社员大会的决议是社员大会讨论通过的，全体社员就都应该遵守和照办；管理委员会是社员大会选举出来的，它的决议全体社员也都应该照办。少数在通过的时候不赞成、没有举手的社员，是不是可以不遵守、不照办呢？不可以。不赞成，通过以后也还可以提意见，大伙都同意了这意见，再开会的时候就可以修改。可是，在没有修改以前，每个社员都要遵守，都要照办。
    第二种义务是“遵守合作社的劳动纪律。按时完成分配给他的工作任务”。合作社的劳动纪律也是社员大伙议定的，是为的保护全体社员的利益。我国的宪法上也规定了每个公民必须遵守劳动纪律。如果社员想不参加社里的劳动就不参加，在参加社里的劳动的时候想怎么干就怎么干，不把工作做好，不按规定的时间完成，合作社就会受损失。社里受了损失，也就是每个社员都受了损失。
    第三种义务是“爱护国家的财产、全社公有的财产和社员私有而交给合作社公用的财产”。爱护和保卫公共财产是每一个公民的义务，这在我国的宪法上早有明文规定。国家财产是全国人都有份的，特别是农业机器站的财产，同社员的利益有直接关系；全社公有的财产，是全社发展生产事业和文化福利事业的根底；私有公用的生产资料，同全社生产的发展也有密切关系；大家都爱护这些财产，同社内的团结、合作社的巩固也有密切关系；损失了社里要赔偿原主，对每个社员也都是一种损失。因此，谁也不许破坏或者侵占、偷窃公共财产和私有公用的财产，谁也要爱护这些财产。
    第四种义务是“巩固全社的团结，同一切破坏合作社的活动作坚决的斗争”。社里闹不团结，什么事也办不好；闹得严重的话，还会把社闹垮。社里的领导人员要紧密地团结起来，全体社员也要紧密地团结起来。谁闹不团结，谁就不是个好社员。闹不团结，就是破坏合作社的一种行为。社员人人都有责任加强全社的团结，防止和改正闹不团结的情形。当然，还有别的破坏合作社的活动，特别是来自地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏活动，每个社员都应该注意。贪污、盗窃等等，也都是破坏合作社的活动。每个社员，只要一发现这些破坏合作社的情形，就要提出来，提给监察委员会、管理委员会，或者提到社员大会上，或者告诉党和政府。
    什么人可以做社员
    是不是随便什么人都可以做农业生产合作社的社员呢？社员既然有许多光荣的权利和义务，农业生产合作社既然是劳动农民的集体经济组织，办社的目的既然是逐步地消灭剥削、发展社会主义的农业经济，那就决不能把随便什么人都吸收进来，也不是随便什么人都有能力做一个社员。入社是自愿的，谁不想入就可以不入；可是并不是自由的，不是谁想入就可以入。示范章程草案规定：年满十六岁的男女劳动农民，或者能够参加合作社劳动的别的劳动人民（例如手工业劳动者和会计人员），自愿申请入社的，经社员大会通过，才能够成为一个社员。不但不接受富农入社，而且要教育社员时时刻刻防止和打击富农对合作社的破坏。在一个合作社刚办起来的几年以内，过去的地主分子和富农分子现在已经改变成份的，也暂不接受。在合作社已经巩固，并且本县和本乡的劳动农民已经有四分之三以上入了社的时候，对于已经按照法律改变了成份的过去的地主分子，和已经多年放弃剥削的富农分子，才可以一个一个地接受他们入社；在接受他们入社的时候，不但要经社员大会审查通过，还要经过县级人民委员会审查批准。示范章程草案还规定：不接受被剥夺了政治权利的人入社（他们的家属除外）。这些规定，是为了保护合作社不受破坏，保护全体社员的利益。为什么可以吸收的时候也要一个一个地吸收呢？这是因为，这些人中间，有经过长期的劳动、一贯老实守法、改造得比较好的；有经过劳动改造，但是还没有改造好的；也有一直不是老老实实守法劳动的。对第一种，才可以吸收。对第二种，可以让参加社里的劳动，但不算社员。对第三种，就坚决不让参加，并且可以把他们分到骨干强、基础好的合作社里去加以管制。
    除了这些人以外，对于要求入社的劳动农民，都不许不让入社。示范章程草案规定：不许限制贫农入社，也不许排斥中农入社（这里当然包括上中农在内，只要他们的确自愿入社，就不要排斥他们）；还规定：要积极地吸收复员军人、烈士家属、军人家属、国家机关工作人员家属和外来移民入社，并且要有计划地吸收能够参加辅助劳动的老弱孤寡入社。有些农户缺少生产资料或者劳动力弱，有些合作社怕“背包袱”，不要他们入社；其实，合作社的生产要不断发展，要发展多种经济，劳动力越多越好，即使是半劳动力，甚至比半劳动力也不如的人，在合作社里也能起不小的作用。办社的一个重要目的，就是逐步消灭剥削，使全体农民共同富裕起来；把这些户丢在社外任人剥削，就违背办社的目的了。
    为什么要年满十六岁才可以做社员？一般地说，年满十六岁才有能力执行社员的权利、尽社员的义务。不满十六岁，可是也能参加社里的劳动，怎么办？可以让他参加劳动，并且同对待社员一样地按照他们劳动的多少、好坏给他们劳动报酬。
    能不能退社？能。入社不是谁想入就可以入，出社却是谁想出就可以出。如果要退社的话，入到社里的土地、东西和钱还给不给？给。怎么给法？在示范章程草案里规定得很合理，很清楚，一看就明白。是不是随便什么时候都可以退？那可不能。那样做就会妨碍全社的生产，并且不便于算账。一般地说，要到生产年度完结的时候（一般地区都是在秋收以后）才能退社。
    做一个社员的确是光荣的，做个好社员就更光荣。还没入社的农民们，欢迎你们做一个社员！已经入社的农民们，祝你们都做一个很好的社员！
