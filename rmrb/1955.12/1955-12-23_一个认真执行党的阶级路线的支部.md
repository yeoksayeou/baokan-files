    A Branch That Conscientiously Implements the Party's Class Line
    Tian Bo, Xiang Qian

    In September of this year, the CPC Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of Hunan Province issued a circular to commend the Houluo Township Branch in Xiangtan County because, from the time it established the first batch of agricultural cooperatives last year to the time it established the second batch of agricultural cooperatives this year, it has always conscientiously implemented the Party's class line, closely relied on the poor peasants, and firmly united the middle peasants. This has not only enabled the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives in the township to account for 68 percent of the total number of peasant households, but also ensured that the leadership of each cooperative is in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. It has basically achieved the requirements put forward by the Party: to establish more and establish well, to emphasize both quantity and quality.

    However, the situation a year ago was completely different. At that time, the phenomenon of discrimination and exclusion against poor peasants was very serious. Of the 198 households in the township who did not participate in mutual aid teams, 138 households were excluded from the mutual aid teams because they were "poor." Even some poor peasants who had already joined the mutual aid teams were squeezed out again. Tang Jianzhong, the deputy secretary of the branch, publicly said: "Poor people can't even feed themselves. Relying on them will leave us with no pants to wear!" The implementation of the class line was realized through continuous struggle against the ideas of discrimination and exclusion against poor peasants and the ideas of harming the interests of middle peasants within and outside the Party.

    Last November, after the branch secretary Yang Zidong and two other branch committee members participated in the training class for key personnel in cooperative establishment organized by the county party committee, they began to feel the seriousness of their failure to implement the Party's class line well. They successively convened branch committee meetings and branch general meetings to criticize the erroneous ideas of discriminating against and excluding poor peasants, and expelled Ou Guoping from the Party for persisting in his mistakes despite repeated education. The vast majority of Party members examined their own thinking in accordance with the Party's class line. Some Party members also formulated specific plans to absorb poor peasants into the teams.

    However, several Party meetings did not change the thinking of all Party members. This situation was exposed when the first batch of cooperatives was established in early December last year. At that time, the branch decided to establish a cooperative based on the mutual aid teams to which Party members Peng Yulin and Yuan Guihua belonged. When discussing the candidates for membership, Peng Yulin tried his best to advocate for the admission of Zhou Hanqing, who had long been excluded from the team and was in dire straits. However, Yuan Guihua opposed, saying: "Zhou Hanqing doesn't even have the qualifications to participate in the mutual aid team? How can he be qualified to join the cooperative?" Peng Yulin repeatedly explained to him the Party's policy of relying on poor peasants to run the cooperatives, but he still couldn't get through to Yuan Guihua. Peng Yulin had no choice but to report the situation to the branch. Branch Secretary Yang Zidong immediately had an individual conversation with Yuan Guihua. At first, Yuan Guihua refused outright to admit Zhou Hanqing into the cooperative. Yang Zidong then asked him: "Comrade Guihua, what did you join the Party for?" Yuan Guihua answered without hesitation: "To enable all peasants to embark on the road to happiness and prosperity." Yang Zidong then asked: "So what is the purpose of admitting Zhou Hanqing into the cooperative now? Isn't it to embark on the road to happiness and prosperity?" This time, Yuan Guihua had nothing to say, but he still didn't admit his mistake, and instead prevaricated, saying: "The middle peasants in the team don't agree. What can I do?" The branch believed that it should first rectify the thinking within the Party in conjunction with the establishment of the cooperative. It immediately convened a branch general meeting to ask everyone to discuss the question of Yuan Guihua's refusal to admit Zhou Hanqing into the cooperative: for whom is the cooperative being run? On whom should we rely? Everyone launched a heated and sharp criticism of Yuan Guihua's thinking. Everyone's questions, analyses, and criticisms truly shook Yuan Guihua's thinking. He thought: I used to be hungry and cold, and I was also a poor man. It hasn't been many days since I stood up, why have I forgotten my roots? Why do I want to abandon poor brothers like Zhou Hanqing? He deeply felt that he was wrong and bravely admitted his mistake to the branch general meeting and criticized his thought of forgetting his roots. The branch general meeting finally passed a resolution entrusting the task of resolving Zhou Hanqing's admission into the cooperative to Party members Peng Yulin and Yuan Guihua. When deliberating on Zhou Hanqing's admission into the cooperative, the middle peasant members also opposed his admission. Peng Yulin and Yuan Guihua, on the one hand, criticized the idea of excluding poor households from joining the cooperative as wrong; on the other hand, they mobilized the poor peasant backbone members in the cooperative to do individual ideological education work for the middle peasants to raise their awareness. Finally, at a meeting of cooperative members, they unanimously approved Zhou Hanqing's admission into the cooperative. Subsequently, the branch used this typical example to educate all cooperatives and teams, gradually creating an atmosphere in the whole township where it was honorable to admit poor peasants into cooperatives and teams. Even the Su Xiaoqiu mutual aid team, which was controlled by middle peasants, admitted six poor peasant households. In this way, 136 poor peasant households in the township joined the cooperatives and teams. Among them, 51 households were in the most difficult circumstances.

    However, the fact that poor peasants joined the cooperatives and teams did not mean that they could be masters of their own affairs. On the contrary, some poor peasants, due to their particular economic difficulties and their long-term discrimination and exclusion, still felt that they were "poor and insignificant" and "their sleeves were too short," and could not be actively involved for a while. In view of this situation, the branch, on the one hand, mobilized cooperative members and team members to help these particularly poor households and provided loans from the state to solve their living difficulties and difficulties in paying their share funds; on the other hand, it educated them to be masters of their own affairs. In this way, the poor peasants who could not raise their heads before raised their heads, and the poor peasants who were not active enough became active. Zhou Hanqing, a poor peasant, became a cooperative member who was wholeheartedly committed to running the cooperative and working hard in production after receiving this kind of help.

    However, at that time, the leadership of some mutual aid teams was still in the hands of upper-middle peasants. The branch gradually cultivated poor peasant backbone members in these mutual aid teams and gradually replaced the upper-middle peasants who held the leadership positions with these poor peasant backbone members. For example, Su Youquan, the leader of the fourth joint team of the mutual aid team, was an upper-middle peasant who had engaged in exploitation and other illegal activities. Pang Jingming, a poor peasant in this team, was a member of the Communist Youth League and an activist during the land reform. However, he became passive later because of his difficult life and the Party's failure to continue to cultivate and educate him. Branch Secretary Yang Zidong talked to him, explaining to him that it was not conducive to the mutual aid and cooperation movement for the joint team to be controlled by an upper-middle peasant like Su Youquan. At the same time, he encouraged him, saying: You are a poor peasant. In the past, during the land reform, the Party relied on you to overthrow the landlords. Now the Party still needs to rely on you to lead the peasants onto the socialist road. As a member of the Communist Youth League, you should take on this responsibility. Under the Party's inspiration and guidance, Pang Jingming became active. After he proactively discovered that Su Youquan had illegally slaughtered another ox, he exposed it at a team meeting and criticized Su Youquan for other wrongdoings. He also helped several poor peasants who had been deceived by Su Youquan to become aware and launch a struggle against Su Youquan. Under the pressure of the masses' awareness in the team, Su Youquan admitted his mistakes. The team members unanimously elected Pang Jingming to replace Su Youquan as the leader of the joint team. Subsequently, the branch helped Pang Jingming unite more than a dozen poor peasants to form the leadership core of the joint team and establish the leading advantage of the poor peasants.

    While closely relying on the poor peasants, the branch also paid special attention to educating the poor peasants to use their active leading actions to influence and unite the middle peasants in all activities to consolidate the mutual aid team and consolidate the cooperative, and to prevent the phenomenon of coercion and command against the middle peasants and the phenomenon of harming the interests of the middle peasants. For example, when the Yimin Cooperative, led by poor peasant Pang Jingwen, carried out fertilizer investment, Li Shufang, a middle peasant and member of the cooperative affairs committee, was only willing to invest two loads of manure, and several other middle peasant households were also not very active. After the branch learned of this situation, it was concerned that the poor peasants in the cooperative might develop two harmful ideas: impatience or passivity. It immediately helped Pang Jingwen convene a meeting of poor cooperative members to analyze the main concerns of the middle peasants who were unwilling to invest actively, which was that they were afraid of losing out if they invested too much. Therefore, the poor peasants must take the lead in investing to influence the middle peasants. Poor peasant Tang Shaohua said: "In the past, we had wine but no one offered it to us, and no one listened to us when we spoke. We were filled with resentment. Now that the Party relies on us to run the cooperative, how can we lag behind?" On the spot, eleven poor peasant households decided to invest all their fertilizer in the cooperative. In this way, the middle peasants' attitude towards investment immediately changed, and Li Shufang, a middle peasant, also invested one-third of her fertilizer in the cooperative. When the Meihu Cooperative was handling the valuation of farm tools for investment in the cooperative, it once lowered the price, which damaged the interests of the middle peasants and affected their emotions. After the branch discovered this, it educated the poor peasant backbone members in the cooperative about the policy of mutual benefit, and then appropriately increased the original valuation of farm tools compared with the market price, so that the cooperative did not suffer a loss and the middle peasants were also satisfied.

    Now, seventeen agricultural production cooperatives have been established in this township. In these seventeen cooperatives, the poor and lower-middle peasants occupy an absolute leading advantage. Among the 207 cadres above the level of cooperative affairs committee members, the poor and lower-middle peasants account for 201. As a result of the implementation of the class line, not only have the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants quickly embarked on the socialist road, but it has also attracted more upper-middle peasants to join the cooperative. Of the 192 upper-middle peasant households in the township, only eight joined the cooperative last year, but this year the number has increased to 75.

    一个认真执行党的阶级路线的支部
    田波　向前
    今年九月，中共湖南湘潭地委会通报表扬了湘潭县厚罗乡支部，因为这个支部从去年办第一批农业合作社到今年办第二批农业合作社的过程中，始终认真执行了党的阶级路线，紧紧地依靠了贫农，巩固地团结了中农，不仅使全乡入社农户占到总农户的百分之六十八，而且使每一个合作社的领导权都掌握在贫农和下中农的手中，基本上达到了党所提出的：既要办多，又要办好，既要数量，又要质量的要求。
    可是，一年以前的情况却完全不是这样。当时歧视和排斥贫农的现象十分严重，全乡没有参加互助组的一百九十八户中，就有一百三十八户是因为“穷”而被关在互助组门外的。甚至有些已经加入互助组的贫农，又被排挤出去。支部副书记汤建中就公开说：“穷人连口都糊不住，依靠他们就会没裤子穿！”阶级路线的贯彻执行，是在同党内外歧视和排斥贫农的思想和损害中农利益的思想不断斗争中才实现的。
    去年十一月，支部书记杨子东和另外两个支部委员参加了县委办的建社骨干训练班学习之后，开始感到自己没有很好执行党的阶级路线的严重性，就连续召开了支部委员会和支部大会，批判那种歧视和排斥贫农的错误思想，并把坚持错误屡教不改的欧国平开除出党。绝大部分党员都按照党的阶级路线对自己的思想作了检查。还有部分党员订出吸收贫农入组的具体计划。
    但是，几次党的会议并没有使所有党员的思想转变过来，这种情况在去年十二月初开始办第一批合作社的时候暴露出来了。当时，支部确定以党员彭玉林、袁桂华所在的互助组为基础建立一个合作社。在讨论入社对象时，彭玉林竭力主张把长期排斥在组外、生活十分困难的周汉清吸收入社，但是袁桂华反对，他说：“周汉清连参加互助组的资格都没有？哪有资格入社？”彭玉林就给他反复讲解党的依靠贫农办社的方针，但仍然打不通袁桂华的思想。彭玉林只好把情况反映给支部。支部书记杨子东马上就找袁桂华个别谈话。开头，袁桂华还是一口拒绝吸收周汉清入社。杨子东便问他：“桂华同志，你入党是为了什么？”袁桂华毫不犹豫地回答：“为了使全体农民走幸福富裕的道路”。杨子东接着又问：“那么现在吸收周汉清入社是为了什么？难道不是为了走幸福富裕的道路？”这一下，袁桂华可没有话说了，但他还不承认自己的错误，又推托说：“组里的中农都不同意，我有什么法子？”支部认为应该结合建社首先整顿党内思想，马上召开了支部大会，要大家就袁桂华拒绝吸收周汉清入社这个问题讨论一下办社究竟是为了谁？究竟该依靠谁？大家就对袁桂华的思想展开了热烈的尖锐的批判。大家的质问、分析和批判使袁桂华的思想真正震动起来，他想：自己从前挨过饿，受过冻，也是一个穷苦人，现在翻身还不几天，为什么就忘了本？为什么就要丢开像周汉清这样的穷弟兄？他深深感到自己是错了，就向支部大会勇敢地承认了自己的错误，批判了自己的忘本思想。支部大会最后通过决议，把周汉清入社问题，交给党员彭玉林和袁桂华负责解决。在酝酿吸收周汉清入社的时候，中农社员也反对接收。彭玉林和袁桂华一方面从正面批判排斥贫困户入社的思想是错误的；另一方面就发动社里的贫农骨干去向中农作个别的思想教育工作，提高他们的觉悟。终于在一次社员大会上，一致通过了接收周汉清入社。接着支部就用这个典型事例教育所有的社和组，逐渐在全乡造成了吸收贫农入社入组光荣的空气，连中农当权的苏孝球互助组也吸收了六户贫农。这样，全乡就有一百三十六户贫农入社入组了。其中生活最困难的就有五十一户。
    可是，贫农入了社入了组，并不等于就能当家作主，相反，有些贫农由于经济上特别困难，由于长期被歧视和被排挤，入社入组以后，仍然感到自己是“人穷颜色低”，“手长衫袖短”，一下还不能积极起来。支部根据这种情况，就对这些特别贫困户，一方面发动社员和组员帮助并由国家发放贷款，解决他们生活上的困难和缴纳股份基金的困难；另一方面又对他们进行当家作主的教育。这样，原来抬不起头来的贫农抬起头来了，原来还不够积极的贫农也积极起来了。贫农周汉清，就是在经过这种帮助之后，变成了一心办社努力生产的一个社员的。
    可是，当时有的互助组的领导权还掌握在上中农的手里，支部就在这些互助组中逐渐培养贫农骨干，并逐步用这些贫农骨干去代替那些掌握领导权的上中农。比如互助组第四联组的组长苏佑泉，就是一个有剥削行为和其他违法行为的上中农。这个组里有一个名叫庞景明的贫农，是青年团员，土地改革中还是积极分子，后来因为生活困难，党又没有继续对他进行培养教育，他就消极起来。支部书记杨子东便找他谈心，对他说明联组被苏佑泉这样一个上中农掌握着是对互助合作运动不利的；同时鼓励他说：你是贫农，过去土地改革中，党依靠你们打倒了地主，现在党还要依靠你们把农民领上社会主义道路。你作为一个青年团员，更应该担当起这个责任。庞景明在党的启发诱导之下，积极起来了。当他主动地查出苏佑泉又宰杀了一头耕牛的违法行为后，就在组里的一次大会上揭发出来，并且对苏佑泉其他的错误行为作了批评，他还帮助受苏佑泉欺骗的几个贫农觉悟过来，向苏佑泉展开斗争。苏佑泉在组内群众觉悟的压力下承认了错误。组员们一致选举庞景明代替苏佑泉担任联组组长。接着，支部又帮助庞景明团结了十多个贫农，形成了联组的领导核心，树立了贫农的领导优势。
    支部在紧紧依靠贫农的同时，还特别注意了教育贫农在巩固互助组和巩固合作社的一切活动中，要用自己积极带头的行动去影响中农和团结中农，要防止对中农强迫命令的现象和损害中农利益的现象。如贫农庞景文领导的益民合作社进行肥料投资的时候，中农李淑芳是社务委员，只肯投两担大粪，其他几户中农也表现不积极。支部知道了这种情况之后，耽心社里的贫农可能产生不是急躁就是消极这样两种有害的思想。马上帮助庞景文召开了贫困社员会，分析了中农不愿积极投资的主要顾虑就是怕投资多了自己吃亏，因此，贫农必须带头投资去影响中农。贫农唐少华说：“我们过去是有酒无人敬，说话无人听，呕足了气，现在党依靠我们办社，我们怎能落后呢？”当场十一户贫农就决定把自己的肥料全部投到社里。这样，中农对投资的态度立即有了转变，中农李淑芳也把三分之一的肥料投到社里了。枚湖合作社在处理农具折价入社的时候，曾一度压低价格，损害了中农的利益，影响了中农的情绪。支部发现后，即对社里的贫农骨干作了互利政策的教育，然后比照市价适当提高原来的农具折价，作到了社里不吃亏，中农也满意。
    现在，这个乡已经建立了十七个农业生产合作社。在这十七个社中，贫农和下中农都占了绝对的领导优势，在二百零七个社务委员以上的干部中，贫农和下中农占了二百零一个。阶级路线贯彻执行的结果，不仅使绝大多数贫农和下中农迅速走上社会主义道路，同时也吸引着更多的上中农加入合作社。全乡一百九十二户上中农中，去年入社的只有八户，今年已经增加到七十五户了。
