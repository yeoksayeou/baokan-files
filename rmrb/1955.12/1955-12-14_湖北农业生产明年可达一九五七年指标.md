    Hubei Agricultural Production to Reach 1957 Targets Next Year
    Hubei Province recently held a provincial agricultural production technology conference, which determined that the province's agricultural production next year should reach the planned targets for 1957. Among the main crops, grain is expected to reach 21.1 billion jin next year, and cotton is expected to reach 3.07 million dan.
    In order to reach the agricultural production increase targets for 1957 next year, all counties in Hubei Province have formulated preliminary plans for agricultural technology reform. The total number of new agricultural tools, such as double-wheeled double-shared plows, planned to be promoted by the counties next year will exceed 105,000, and the amount of fertilizer applied will also be generally increased. In their plans, all counties have identified key measures for increasing production based on local characteristics. In the Jianghan Plain and the areas along the Yangtze River and around the lakes, more than 4 million mu of farmland will be converted from indica rice to japonica rice, and from single-season rice to double-season rice next year, which can increase grain production by more than 500 million jin. The area of cotton fields using the Dai character cotton improved variety will also be significantly expanded. In Mianyang County alone, the planting area of Dai character cotton next year will increase from 50,000 mu this year to 600,000 mu, and it is expected to increase the production of ginned cotton by 48,000 dan. In order to overcome the contradiction between cotton and wheat double cropping, Sui County, Xiangyang, Zhaoyang and other counties in northern Hubei will promote the late-sowing and early-maturing Nandada 2419 improved wheat variety on more than 4 million mu next year. At the same time, strip sowing will be generally promoted, and the method of transplanting cotton seedlings in nutrient pots will be adopted to change cotton and wheat intercropping into continuous cropping. The mountainous areas in western and southern Hubei are the main producing areas of miscellaneous grains, tea, and hemp in the province. Lichiuan, Jianshi and other counties in these areas will strengthen measures to prevent diseases, insect pests, bird damage, and animal damage to miscellaneous grains. Yangxin County, the largest ramie producing area in the province, will expand the planting area of ramie to more than three times that of this year next year. (Yuan Jun)

    湖北农业生产明年可达一九五七年指标
    湖北省最近举行全省农业生产技术会议，确定明年全省的农业生产要达到一九五七年的计划指标。主要农作物中，粮食明年预计要生产二百一十一亿斤，棉花要生产三百零七万担。
    为了在明年就能达到一九五七年的农业增产指标，湖北省各县都制定了农业技术改革的初步规划。各县计划在明年推广的双轮双铧犁等新式农具，总计在十万五千部以上，施肥量也将普遍增加。各县在规划中都针对当地的特点，确定了关键性的增产措施。江汉平原和沿江滨湖地区，明年将有四百多万亩田地实行籼稻改粳稻，一季稻改双季稻，共可增产粮食五亿斤以上；采用岱字棉良种的棉田也将显著扩大，仅沔阳一个县，明年岱字棉的种植面积就将由今年的五万亩增加到六十万亩，预计可以增产皮棉四万八千担。为了克服棉麦两熟的矛盾，鄂北地区的随县、襄阳、枣阳等县，明年将推广迟播早熟的南大二四一九小麦良种达到四百多万亩，同时要普遍推行条播，开始采用营养钵的棉苗移栽方法，改棉麦间作为连作。鄂西和鄂南山区是全省杂粮、茶、麻的主要产地。这些地区的利川、建始等县都将加强防止杂粮病虫害和鸟害、兽害的措施。全省产苎麻最多的阳新县，明年苎麻的种植面积将扩大到今年的三倍多。　（袁军）
