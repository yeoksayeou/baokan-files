Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 13th: Bulganin, Khrushchev, and their entourage visited the Sonipat district, 56 kilometers north of Delhi, on the morning of December 12th.

Sonipat district is located in East Punjab Province and is one of the bases where the Indian government is implementing the "Village Development Plan." The "Village Development Plan" began in 1952 with the aim of overcoming the backwardness of Indian rural areas that has persisted for generations and improving the living standards of Indian farmers. The plan has now been implemented in areas with a total population of over 30 million. Since 1953, a simplified plan called the "National Extension Service" plan has been implemented as a supplement. The two plans together cover more than 100,000 villages with a population of over 68 million. India's rural population totals 310 million.

Arches were erected everywhere along the forty-mile road from Delhi to Sonipat, with slogans in Hindi and Russian welcoming the Soviet leaders. The Soviet leaders were warmly welcomed by farmers from nearby villages along the way. They stopped in Bhatgaon village, where they were welcomed by Sachar, the Chief Minister of East Punjab Province, and Kailon, the Minister of Development of East Punjab Province, among others. In this village, Bulganin and Khrushchev visited schools, clinics, handicraft workshops, handicraft exhibitions, and demonstration areas where advanced methods were used to cultivate sugarcane, wheat, and other crops. The guests finally visited a local exhibition of draught animals and dairy cows. As the Soviet leaders passed by, people gathered along the roadside and on the rooftops showered them with rose petals and shouted the slogan "Indians and Russians are brothers."

On a temporary platform erected outside the village, Khrushchev addressed hundreds of thousands of farmers. He thanked the residents of Sonipat for their warm reception. Khrushchev said that we are very happy to be guests of the Indian farmers today.

Khrushchev then said that the actual situation in the Soviet Union has proved that farmers can develop rapidly as long as they have conditions for rapid development.

On behalf of the collective farmers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev congratulated the people present and, through them, all the farmers of India, wishing them continuous development of their spiritual and material strength. Khrushchev emphasized that the way for farmers to achieve material and spiritual development is to supply the countryside with machines to develop agricultural production. Khrushchev wished the Indian people success in this regard.

As the distinguished guests set off back to Delhi, hundreds of thousands of farmers saw them off with stormy applause and salutes.

After returning to Delhi, Bulganin and Khrushchev paid a visit to Prime Minister Nehru that afternoon and held talks with him.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 13th: On the morning of December 13th, Bulganin and Khrushchev, accompanied by Kanungo, the Indian government's Minister of Industries responsible for industry, and B. Birla, Chairman of the Indian Industries Fair Committee, visited the Indian Industries Fair.

The Soviet leaders visited the Chinese Pavilion at 11 a.m. Two Chinese children presented them with flowers. Yuan Zhongxian, the Chinese Ambassador to India, Ma Yimin, the head of the Chinese delegation to the Indian Industries Fair, and officials from the Chinese Embassy accompanied them on the visit.

The Soviet leaders also visited the Indian government's exhibition stand and the Indian handloom and handicraft exhibition hall, as well as the exhibition halls of the Soviet Union, the United States, and other countries.

A large crowd gathered outside the Chinese Pavilion and cheered as the Soviet leaders came out. At this time, someone put beautifully woven garlands on the Soviet leaders. Mothers brought their children to see the Soviet leaders, hoping they would bless their children. Bulganin and Khrushchev kindly placed their hands on the children's heads, fully satisfying the long-cherished wishes of the Indian mothers.

    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问索奈帕特区
    据新华社新德里十三日电　布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫和随行人员十二月十二日上午访问了德里以北五十六公里的索奈帕特区。
    索奈帕特区在东旁遮普省，是印度政府实行“乡村发展计划”的基地之一。“乡村发展计划”是在一九五二年开始实行的，目的在于克服印度农村世世代代以来的落后状态，提高印度农民的生活水平。现在已经在人口总数三千多万的地区实行了这个计划。从一九五三年起，又补充实行了一个简化的计划，名为“国家发展促进”计划。两个计划共包括乡村十万个以上，人口超过六千八百万人。印度农村人口共有三亿一千万人。
    从德里到索奈帕特长达四十英里的道路上到处搭起了彩门，上面写着印地文和俄文的欢迎苏联领袖们的标语。苏联领袖们沿途受到附近村庄农民的热烈欢迎。他们在巴特高恩村停车，在那里受到东旁遮普省首席部长萨查尔，东旁遮普省发展部部长凯隆等的欢迎。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在这个村子里参观了学校、医疗所、手工业作坊、手工业品展览处，以及用先进方法栽培甘蔗、小麦和其它农作物的示范地区。客人们最后参观了当地出产的役畜和乳牛的展览会。聚集在路旁和屋顶上的人们在苏联领袖们经过的时候，向他们撒玫瑰花瓣，并且高呼“印度人和俄国人是兄弟”的口号。
    在村子外面临时搭成的讲台上，赫鲁晓夫向几十万农民讲了话。他感谢索奈帕特居民的热烈接待。赫鲁晓夫说，我们今天能在印度农民这里作客感到非常高兴。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，苏联的实际情况证明了，农民只要有了迅速发展的条件，就可以得到迅速的发展。
    赫鲁晓夫代表苏联的集体农民，向到会的人，并且通过他们向印度的全体农民祝贺，祝他们的精神和物质的力量不断发展。赫鲁晓夫着重说，农民达到物质和精神发展的道路是用机器供应农村发展农业生产。赫鲁晓夫祝印度人民在这方面获得成就。
    当贵宾们动身回德里的时候，数十万农民以暴风雨般鼓掌和致敬的口号声欢送他们。
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫回到德里后，在当天下午拜会了尼赫鲁总理，并且同他举行了会谈。
    新华社新德里十三日电　布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫十二月十三日上午在印度政府工商部负责工业部长卡农戈和印度工业博览会委员会主席布·比拉的陪同下参观了印度工业博览会。
    苏联领袖们在上午十一点参观了中国馆。两个中国儿童向他们献了花。中国驻印度大使袁仲贤、中国参加印度工业博览会展览团团长马一民和中国大使馆官员们陪同他们进行了参观。
    苏联领袖们也参观了印度政府的展览台和印度的手织机和手工业品展览馆，以及苏联、美国和其他国家的展览馆。
    大批人群聚集在中国馆外面，在苏联领袖们走出来的时候向他们欢呼。这个时候，有人给苏联领袖们戴上了编织得十分美丽的花环。母亲们带着她们的孩子去见苏联领袖们，希望他们为自己的孩子祝福。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫亲切地把手放在孩子们的头上。完全满足了印度母亲们长久来的心愿。
