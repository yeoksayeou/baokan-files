    Hubei Province has initially planned to develop more than 1,100 fishery production cooperatives from this winter to next autumn. The number of households joining the cooperatives will account for about 25 percent of the total number of fishing households. At present, some areas have already trained a group of key personnel for running fishery cooperatives. Most of the nine lake area counties in Huanggang Prefecture have also been equipped with full-time cadres responsible for fishery work.
    Hubei Province is a famous freshwater fishing area, with a total area of about 18.8 million mu of rivers, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. There are a total of 120,000 fishing households in the province. Last year, 94 fishery production cooperatives were established in the province, and more than 95 percent of the cooperatives increased production. Generally, the cooperatives increased production by 20 to 30 percent compared with local fishermen. The Jin Tan Fishery Production Cooperative in Huangpi County, which had the most significant increase in production, increased production by more than two times compared with local fishermen. The actual income of all 28 members of the cooperative increased by more than 50 percent compared with before joining the cooperative. Under the influence of the demonstration of increased production in the old cooperatives, the vast number of fishermen recognized the path they should choose. After Chairman Mao's instruction on "the issue of agricultural cooperation" reached the fishing villages, it further stimulated the enthusiasm of the vast number of fishermen, who asked to join the cooperatives one after another. The seven fishery mutual aid teams in Guandang Township, Mianyang County, quickly formed two cooperative frameworks. In addition, six new mutual aid teams were developed in this township.

    湖北积极发展渔业合作社
    湖北省初步计划从今冬至明年秋季，全省发展一千一百多个渔业生产合作社，入社户数将占总渔户的百分之二十五左右。目前，有些地区已经集训了一批办渔业合作社的骨干。黄冈专区九个湖区县份大部分还配备了负责渔业的专职干部。
    湖北省是著名的淡水渔区，全省江河、湖沼、塘堰、水库等面积约有一千八百多万亩，共有渔民十二万户。去年全省建立了九十四个渔业生产合作社，百分之九十五以上的社都增产。一般的社都比当地渔民增产百分之二十到三十，增产最显著的黄陂县金潭渔业生产合作社，比当地渔民增产两倍多，全社二十八户社员的实际收入，比入社前增加了百分之五十以上。广大渔民在老社增产示范的影响下，认识了自己应该选择的道路。毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的指示到达渔村后，更激发了广大渔民的积极性，纷纷要求入社。沔阳县官壋乡的七个渔业互助组很快搭成了两个社架子，另外这个乡还新发展了六个互助组。（余世岑）
