    Strengthen Antibiotic Research

    The Chinese Academy of Sciences is holding the 1955 Antibiotic Academic Conference starting from December 1st, inviting many scholars from related disciplines at home and abroad to discuss academic issues related to antibiotics and exchange work experience in order to develop China's antibiotic industry and research.

    The discovery and application of antibiotics is one of the major scientific achievements of the last decade or so, and it has opened up a new field in pharmacology. During World War II, medical workers were able to save the lives of many critically ill and injured patients by using this powerful new weapon against disease. The widespread use of antibiotics has reduced the incidence and mortality of many diseases, shortened the course of these diseases, and reduced complications. Antibiotics have remarkable effects on many serious and intractable diseases of microbial infection, such as pneumonia, typhoid fever, typhus, and tuberculosis. Antibiotics are of great significance for the treatment of trauma and war wounds and for national defense. Today, antibiotics are the most important drugs widely used in medical and health care. In 1955, the total amount of antibiotics used in my country increased by 580 percent compared with 1952, and antibiotic preparations accounted for a large proportion of the total drug consumption. Antibiotics not only play a significant role in people's health, but with the discovery of various new antibiotics and continuous in-depth research, antibiotics have been promoted and applied to veterinary medicine and plant disease control, becoming an important means to ensure increased agricultural and animal husbandry production.

    In old China, due to the reactionary rulers' indifference to the people's health, there was no antibiotic manufacturing industry at all, and all the antibiotics used were imported from foreign countries; scientific research on antibiotics could not be developed, and only a few scientists carried out small-scale research under conditions of extreme lack of equipment and funding. After the founding of New China, in order to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in antibiotics for various applications in our country, the Party and the government first established a factory to produce penicillin. The output of penicillin in our country has increased year by year, and the output in 1955 will reach 160 times that of 1952. Chloramphenicol has also begun to be produced in large quantities. In addition, chlortetracycline and streptomycin have also been successfully trial-produced, and experiments are being further expanded in preparation for the construction of new factories and the expansion of production.

    With the development of people's health care and the antibiotic industry, scientific research on antibiotics has also been continuously improved. In the first five-year plan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, antibiotic research has been listed as one of the key tasks. In the past few years, the cooperative research between scientific workers and production departments has improved the fermentation units of penicillin, and has also studied the method of using domestic cottonseed cake as a fermentation raw material, which has reduced costs and improved equipment utilization and yield. In terms of chloramphenicol research, a safe and effective production method using domestic raw materials has been obtained, and the yield exceeds the records in the literature. In terms of chlortetracycline, the selection and breeding of chlortetracycline strains and fermentation conditions were studied; the physiology of chlortetracycline was studied based on the Michurin theory, and thus a way to increase chlortetracycline production was found; the refining method and chemical structure of chlortetracycline were successfully studied. Now the research work on chlortetracycline has entered the intermediate test stage. In addition, an agile and reliable method was proposed for the analysis of chlortetracycline. New progress has also been made in the theoretical aspect of the mechanism of action of this antibiotic. The streptomycin research conducted in cooperation between scientific research departments and production departments has also achieved good results. Theoretical research has been carried out on the physiology of Streptomyces and the chemistry of streptomycin, and certain results have been obtained. In order to extract streptomycin from the fermentation broth, a new ion exchange resin with good exchange performance was synthesized. Research has also been carried out on the phage of Streptomyces and the selection and breeding of anti-phage strains. Terramycin has also been successfully trial-produced. In the past few years, in order to find new antibiotic strains and isolate new antibiotics, scientific workers have conducted extensive surveys and research work in various parts of the motherland, obtained many strains with antibiotic effects from soil samples in different regions, and analyzed and studied several of the strains with strong antibiotic effects and the antibiotics they produce. Scientific workers have also solved the complex stereoscopic structure and synthesis problems of citrinin. In terms of the clinical application of antibiotics, medical workers have also carried out certain work. The application of antibiotic strains in cotton cultivation in some areas has significantly increased cotton production. These research works have provided valuable scientific basis for the smooth development of the antibiotic industry in the future, and have also laid a good foundation for future theoretical research on antibiotics.

    One of the important reasons why scientific workers in our country have been able to achieve fruitful results in antibiotic research in the past few years is the creative cooperation between scientific workers in related disciplines and between scientific research departments and production departments, health departments, and scientific workers in universities. As a collective scientific research, antibiotic research includes work in microbiology, biochemistry, organic chemistry, chemical engineering, and medicine. Therefore, the cooperation of scholars from various disciplines is an indispensable and important condition for correctly determining the direction and steps of research work, and for correctly handling and solving problems. This cooperation has played a great role in improving the scientific level of antibiotics, developing technology, and cultivating talents. This experience should not only continue to be used in antibiotic work in the future, but also should be promoted in other collective scientific work.

    Another important reason for the rich achievements of China's antibiotic industry and research work is to humbly learn from international advanced experience and the latest achievements. In the past few years, the exchange of experience in international research and production, the exchange of strains and data, especially the assistance given to us by Soviet experts in improving production and building factories, and the opinions they provided in scientific research have played an important role in China's antibiotic industry and research work. Many friends from the foreign scientific community are participating in this antibiotic academic conference, and we should take this opportunity to better learn from foreign advanced experience and the latest achievements.

    We should not be satisfied with the existing achievements of China's antibiotic industry and research work. Today, the antibiotics needed in our country still rely on imports, and our country's antibiotic production and scientific research are still far behind the needs of the people. In order to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction, it is necessary to quickly change this situation, so that China's antibiotic industry can start producing various cheap and effective antibiotics in large quantities in the shortest possible time to meet the needs of the people. To this end, scientific workers should, under the leadership of the National Antibiotic Research Work Committee, further strengthen scientific research work. First, they must assist in solving the key problems in production and theory of several commonly used antibiotics, carry out research on new antibiotic strains and antibiotics, and conduct trials on the clinical application of antibiotics. In order to victoriously complete these tasks, scientific workers must strengthen the established cooperative relationships in all aspects, strengthen the planning of work, strengthen the weak links in cooperation, and better learn from foreign advanced experience and important achievements, so that China's antibiotic research work can be rapidly improved to a new level in all aspects.

    加强抗生素的研究工作
    中国科学院从十二月一日起举行一九五五年抗生素学术会议，邀请国内国外很多位有关学科的学者讨论抗生素的学术问题，交流工作经验，以发展我国抗生素工业和研究工作。
    抗生素的发现和应用是近十几年来科学上的重大成就之一，它在药物学上开辟了一个新的领域。在第二次世界大战中，由于利用了这个有力的抵抗疾病的新武器，医药工作者曾挽救过很多濒于死亡的伤病者的生命。抗生素的广泛使用，降低了好多种疾病的发病率和死亡率，缩短了这些疾病的疗程，减少了并发症。对于很多微生物感染的严重疾病和顽抗性的疾病，例如肺炎、伤寒、斑疹伤寒、结核病，抗生素都有卓越的疗效。抗生素对于创伤和战伤的治疗，在国防上更有重大的意义。到今天，抗生素已经是医疗保健事业上广泛应用的最重要的药物。一九五五年我国抗生素的使用总量比一九五二年增长了百分之五百八十，在全部药品消耗量中，抗生素制剂占着很大比重。抗生素不仅对于人民的健康有重大的作用，随着各种新抗生素的发现和不断深入的研究，抗生素已经推广应用到兽医和植物病害防治方面，成为保证农业和畜牧业增产的一个重要手段。
    在旧中国，由于反动统治者对人民的健康漠不关心，根本没有抗生素制造工业，所用的抗生素全部从外国进口；抗生素的科学研究工作也不能发展，只有个别科学家在设备和经费都极端缺乏的情况下进行小规模的研究。新中国成立以后，党和政府为了使我国各方面应用的抗生素能够逐步作到自给自足，首先建立了生产青霉素的工厂。我国青霉素的产量逐年增加，一九五五年的产量将达到一九五二年的一百六十倍。氯霉素也已开始大量生产。此外，还试制成功了金霉素和链霉素，并且正在进一步扩大试验，为配合新厂的建设和扩大生产作准备。
    随着人民保健事业和抗生素工业的发展，抗生素的科学研究工作也不断提高。在中国科学院的第一个五年计划中，抗生素研究已被列为重点工作之一。几年来，科学工作者同生产部门的合作研究，提高了青霉素发酵单位，并且研究了以国产棉子饼作为发酵原料的方法，降低了成本，提高了设备利用率和收率。在氯霉素研究方面，得到了一个使用国产原料的安全有效的生产方法，收率超过了文献的记录。在金霉素方面，研究了金霉菌菌种的选育和发酵条件；根据米丘林学说研究了金霉菌的生理，从而找到了提高金霉素产量的途径；成功地研究了金霉素的提炼方法和化学结构。现在金霉素的研究工作已进入中间试制阶段。另外，对于金霉素的分析，提出了敏捷可靠的方法。在这种抗生素作用机制的理论方面也获得了新的进展。科学研究部门和生产部门合作进行的链霉素研究，也有了很好的成绩。对于链霉菌的生理和链霉素的化学方面进行了理论性的研究，已有一定的结果。为了从发酵液中提取链霉素，合成了新的交换性能很好的离子交换树脂。在链霉菌的噬菌体及抗噬菌体的菌种选育方面也进行了研究。还初步试制成功了地霉素。几年来，科学工作者为了找寻新的抗生菌种和分离新的抗生素，在祖国各地进行了广泛的调查研究工作，从不同地区的土壤样品中得到了许多有抗生作用的菌株，并且对其中几个有很强抗生作用的菌种和它们产生的抗生物质作了分析研究。科学工作者还解决了复杂的橘霉素立体结构问题和合成问题。在抗生素的临床应用方面，医学工作者也进行了一定的工作。抗生菌种在某些地区的棉花栽培上的应用，使棉花产量显著增加。这些研究工作为今后抗生素工业的顺利发展提供了宝贵的科学依据，也为今后的抗生素理论研究打下了很好的基础。
    我国科学工作者几年来在抗生素研究工作中所以能够取得丰富成果的重要原因之一，是各有关学科的科学工作者之间和科学研究部门同生产部门、卫生部门以及高等学校的科学工作者之间的创造性的合作。作为一项集体性的科学研究，抗生素研究工作包括了微生物学、生物化学、有机化学、化学工程和医学等方面的工作。因此各个学科之间的学者们的合作，是正确地确定研究工作的方向、步骤，正确地处理问题和解决问题所不可缺少的重要条件。这种合作对于提高抗生素科学水平、发展技术和培养人材等方面都起了极大的作用。这一经验今后不仅应该在抗生素工作中继续运用，而且应该在其他的集体性科学工作中加以推广。
    我国抗生素工业和研究工作取得丰富成果的另一重要原因，是虚心学习国际的先进经验和最新成就。几年来国际间的研究和生产的经验交流、菌种和资料的交换，特别是苏联专家在改进生产和建厂工作中所给予我们的帮助和在科学研究方面给我们提供的意见，对于我国抗生素工业和研究工作起了重要的作用。这次抗生素学术会议有很多外国科学界的朋友参加，我们应当利用这个机会更好地学习外国的先进经验和最新成就。
    我国的抗生素工业和研究工作已有的成就，不应该使我们满足。今天我国所需用的抗生素还要依靠进口，我国的抗生素生产和科学研究还远远落在人民需要的后面。为了保证社会主义建设的顺利进行，必须迅速改变这种情况，使我国的抗生素工业能够在最短的时间内开始大量地生产各种价廉而有效的抗生素，满足人民的需要。为此，科学工作者应该在全国抗生素研究工作委员会的领导下，进一步加强科学研究工作，首先必须协助解决目前几种常用抗生素的生产上和理论上的关键性问题，开展新抗生菌种和抗生物质的研究，以及抗生素在临床应用方面的试验。为了胜利地完成这些任务，科学工作者必须加强各方面已经建立起来的合作关系，加强工作中的计划性，加强合作中的较薄弱的环节，更好地学习国外的先进经验和重要成就，使我国的抗生素研究工作在各个方面都能够迅速地提高到新的水平上去。
