    Collective Purchase and Sale
    Yangtang Township, Xuchang County, a famous flue-cured tobacco producing area, has basically achieved semi-socialist collectivization. The township now has fifteen agricultural cooperatives, with farmer households joining accounting for 90.46 percent of the total number of households.
    In previous years, farmers sold flue-cured tobacco to the market one load at a time, and bought back what they needed in piecemeal fashion. But this year is different. Agricultural cooperatives have properly arranged winter production, and the term "winter idleness" no longer exists. Farmers rarely go to the market, saying: It's so busy with work, it's better to buy and sell together.
    According to the farmers' requirements, the county and district supply and marketing cooperatives dispatched five people to Yangtang Township. Relying on the Party branch and the agricultural cooperatives, they organized farmers to collectively sell flue-cured tobacco and order production and living materials.
    On November 29, the fifteen agricultural cooperatives in Yangtang Township used ninety-nine ox carts to transport 49,180 catties of flue-cured tobacco to the supply and marketing cooperative. At the same time, they collectively bought back thirty-seven waterwheels, nineteen double-wheeled double-furrow plows, and some eight-inch walking plows, sprayers, dusting boxes, weeding hoes, etc., by cooperative. They also brought back a large number of daily necessities for the members. After the collective sale of tobacco, the supply and marketing cooperative developed 637 new members and collected more than 1,900 yuan in share capital.
    In collectivized areas, not only production activities have changed, but also the purchasing and sales habits and living habits of farmers are changing. These new changes bring new requirements to rural commercial work, and the supply and marketing cooperatives in these areas should adapt to these new requirements.

    集体购销
    著名烤烟产区许昌县杨堂乡已经基本上实现了半社会主义合作化，全乡现有农业合作社十五个，入社农户占总农户的百分之九十点四六。
    往年，农民们一担一担到市场去卖烤烟，并且零星地买回他们所需要的东西。可是今年不同了，农业合作社早把冬季生产安排得妥妥当当，“冬闲”这个字眼已经不存在了。农民轻易不赶集，他们说：活这样忙，不如一块买卖好。
    县、区供销合作社根据农民的要求，抽出五个人到杨堂乡，依靠党的支部和农业合作社，组织农民集体出售烤烟，订购生产资料和生活资料。
    十一月二十九日，杨堂乡十五个农业合作社套了九十九辆牛车，拉了四万九千一百八十斤烤烟卖给了供销合作社，同时以社为单位集体买回了三十七部水车，十九部双轮双铧犁，和一部分八吋步犁、喷雾器、喷粉箱、耘锄等，还给社员带回了大批日用品。在集体售烟以后，供销合作社发展了六百三十七名社员，收股金一千九百多元。
    在合作化了的地区，不仅生产活动发生了变化，农民的购销习惯和生活习惯也在发生变化。新的变化给农村商业工作带来了新的要求，这些地区的供销合作社应该适应这种新的要求。
