    Where is the Iron Curtain?
    The Four Foreign Ministers Conference did not reach an agreement on the development of East-West contact, and the American propaganda machine tried its best to attribute it to the fault of the Soviet Union; they stubbornly tried to make people believe in the ghost story of "the Soviet Union refusing to drop the iron curtain." But the facts are, after all, the most eloquent. Even Drew Pearson, an American commentator known for his anti-Sovietism, could not help but tell the truth.
    In an article published in the "Washington Post" on November 26, Pearson, while still mentioning the Soviet Union's "iron curtain" which never existed in reality, could not but admit that the Soviet Union is trying its best to promote friendly exchanges and contact with other countries, while the United States is strengthening "its own iron curtain." He listed the facts that the US State Department unreasonably rejected the "Hutchinson News" of Kansas's proposal for American and Soviet farmers who grow wheat to visit each other, and the Philadelphia Quaker's proposal for American and Soviet marketing experts to visit each other, and accused "the State Department of starting (actually insisting on) a narrow-minded policy of limiting people-to-people exchanges to a minimum."
    Pearson also revealed that the reason why the US State Department is preventing people-to-people exchanges and contact between the US and the Soviet Union is that some people in the United States do not want to see the improvement of US-Soviet relations and the strengthening of international trust. These people have been carrying out "behind-the-scenes sabotage" in the two Geneva conferences. He said: "There is now concrete evidence that even in July this year when Eisenhower was still talking to Bulganin, some people around him did not want the Geneva conference to be very successful. ... For example, American military figures have frankly expressed to me and other reporters their concern that too much laughter and talk between the United States and Russia will reduce their funding. ..."
    This commentator reminded the Washington authorities that although the United States can drop an "iron curtain" around the United States, it cannot prevent contact between the people of Eastern and Western countries. He gave American diplomats a vivid adjective, calling them "ostrich diplomats," saying that what they "did not see is that while the State Department is preventing dozens of Russians from coming to the United States, thousands of Russians are going to other countries, and the same number of foreigners are going to Russia." Pearson pointed out that the tide of American people demanding free exchanges will "be able to break through the State Department's layers of red tape." (Rui)

    铁幕在那里
    四国外长会议没有就发展东西方接触问题达成协议，美国的宣传机器竭力想把它说成是由于苏联的过错；它们硬要人相信什么“苏联不肯放下铁幕”的鬼话。但是事实终究是最雄辩的。一向以反苏著名的美国评论员德鲁·皮尔逊也不能不说几句老实话。
    皮尔逊在十一月二十六日“华盛顿邮报”登载的一篇文章中，尽管还提到事实上从来就不存在的苏联的“铁幕”，但是，却不能不承认，苏联正在尽力促进同其他国家的友好往来和接触，而美国却在加强“自己的铁幕”。他列举了美国国务院无理拒绝了堪萨斯州“霍钦逊新闻报”建议美苏种植小麦的农民互相访问和费城公谊会信徒建议美苏市场销售专家互相访问等事实，指责“国务院开始了（其实是坚持了）把人对人来往限制到最小程度的小心眼儿政策”。
    皮尔逊并且揭露，美国国务院所以阻止美苏人民往来和接触，是因为美国有人不愿意看到美苏关系的改善和国际信任的加强。这些人一直在两次日内瓦会议中进行“幕后破坏”。他说：“现在有具体证据证明，甚至在今年七月艾克仍然在同布尔加宁谈话的时候，在他身边的某些人就不希望日内瓦会议得到很大成功。……例如，美国军界人士很坦率地对我和其他记者表示担心美国和俄国之间过多的言笑将会减少他们的拨款。……”
    这位评论员提醒华盛顿当局：美国虽然可以在美国四周放下“铁幕”，但是它阻挠不了东西方各国人民之间的接触。他给美国的外交人员安上了一个生动的形容词，叫作“鸵鸟外交人员”说他们“没有看到的是：虽然国务院制止几十个俄国人前来美国，而几千名俄国人却在前往其他国家，并且有同样数目的外国人前往俄国”。皮尔逊指出，美国人民要求自由往来的浪潮将“能够打破国务院的层层官样文章的”。（瑞）
