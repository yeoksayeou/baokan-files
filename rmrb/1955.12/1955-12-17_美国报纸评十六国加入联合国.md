Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 16th: American newspapers are enthusiastically commenting on the admission of sixteen new member states to the United Nations, achieved through the persistent and proactive efforts of Soviet diplomacy.

	The "New York Herald Tribune" said: "On the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations, the United States has gotten itself into a very unpleasant position. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, has taken the initiative."

	"New York Post" commentator Rashi said that the general opinion at the United Nations headquarters seems to be that "the Russians have won a diplomatic victory." He wrote that the Soviet Union has isolated Chiang Kai-shek in the United Nations and strengthened the Soviet Union's prestige among anti-colonial countries.

	American newspapers point out that the Chiang Kai-shek representative, who, with American support, attempted to prevent a positive resolution to the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations, will not be able to remain in the United Nations for much longer. "New York Times" reporter Abel said that due to the Chiang Kai-shek faction's veto of the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic, "Latin American republics, the Arab bloc, and Asian countries are all inclined to criticize the United States with varying degrees of emphasis."

	"New York Herald Tribune" columnist Lippmann believes that without a doubt, the Chiang Kai-shek representative will soon lose his seat on the Security Council, and at the same time, "his disregard for the mood of the entire United Nations may make it extremely difficult to try to preserve Taiwan's seat in the United Nations General Assembly."

	The "New York Times" published an editorial saying: "The increase in United Nations members will fundamentally change the voting situation within the organization. The number of Communist votes will almost double. Countries that are somewhat neutral will increase to a quarter of the total number of members. The voice of Asia, which sounded like a whisper at the time of the founding of the United Nations, will be louder than any other continent in the future."

	The "New York Times" pointed out that among these new member states, "the members of the Bandung Conference will gain the most. Six of the sixteen member states are countries that participated in the Bandung Conference." The newspaper said that increasingly important issues will be those "involving colonialism, economic development, and social undertakings, because these issues are of deep concern to Asian, African, and Latin American countries."

    美国报纸评十六国加入联合国
    新华社据塔斯社纽约十六日讯  美国报纸热烈评论由于苏联外交的坚持不懈的努力和主动而实现的十六个新会员国加入联合国。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”说：“在接纳新会员国加入联合国的问题上，美国弄得焦头烂额，处于极其不愉快的地位。而苏联却取得了主动。”
    “纽约邮报”评论员拉希说，联合国总部的一般意见似乎认为，“俄国人赢得了一次外交上的胜利”。他写道，苏联使得蒋介石在联合国里孤立起来，而且加强了苏联在反殖民主义国家中的威信。
    美国报纸指出，在美国支持下企图使接纳新会员国加入联合国的问题不能得到积极的解决的蒋介石代表将不能再在联合国中留多久了。“纽约时报”记者阿伯尔说，由于蒋介石分子否决接纳蒙古人民共和国的行动，“拉丁美洲各共和国、阿拉伯集团和亚洲国家都倾向于以不同程度的强调语气批评美国”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”专栏作家李普曼认为，毫无疑问，蒋介石代表不久将丧失他在安全理事会中的席位，同时，“他的不顾整个联合国的情绪的做法可能使得设法保全台湾在联合国大会中的席位成为极其困难的事情”。
    “纽约时报”发表社论说：“联合国会员国增加后将使这个组织内的投票情况发生根本的变化。共产党的票数几乎将增加一倍。多少有些抱中立态度的国家将增加到会员国总数的四分之一。在联合国成立的时候像是耳语似的亚洲的声音以后将比任何一个洲更响亮。”
    “纽约时报”指出，在这些新会员国中，“万隆会议的成员国将得到最大的收获。十六个会员国中有六个是参加万隆会议的国家”。这家报纸说，越来越重要的问题将是那些“涉及殖民主义、经济发展和社会事业的问题，因为这些问题是亚非国家和拉丁美洲国家深深关心的问题”。
