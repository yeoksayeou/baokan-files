	A Thief Complains
	Portuguese Foreign Minister Cunha said on the 22nd that the Portuguese government had gone to the International Court of Justice in The Hague to "sue" India, allegedly for India's "occupation" of the "Portuguese Indian territories" of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.
	Dadra and Nagar Haveli are two places on the Indian mainland that have always belonged to India. It is true that these two places, like Goa, were once occupied by Portuguese colonialists for hundreds of years. However, although colonialists can declare all the things they have plundered as their own inherent property, history and the Indian people have never recognized this. In 1954, the Indian people of Dadra and Nagar Haveli did what was within their rights, rose up and disarmed the local Portuguese colonial forces, and declared the end of Portuguese colonial rule there. Obviously, the Indian people liberated these two territories, merely recovering stolen goods from thieves.
	Now, as the saying goes, "The wicked person strikes first." This thief not only still occupies a portion of the loot, but also goes to court, demanding that the recovered stolen goods be returned to him. This is not only a new provocation by colonialists against the Indian people and all anti-colonialists, but also a blatant insult to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, an international organization.
	This absurd action by Portugal occurred after U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly supported Portugal's continued occupation of Goa. This shows that this thief dares to be so arrogant because it relies on someone to support it. (Ping)

### 强盗告状

    强盗告状
    葡萄牙外交部长库纳在二十二日说，葡萄牙政府已经到海牙国际法院去“控告”印度，据说是印度“占领”了“葡属印度领土”达特拉和纳加拉维尼。
    达特拉和纳加拉维尼是印度大陆上的一向属于印度的两处地方。不错，这两处地方也和果阿一样，曾经被葡萄牙殖民者霸占了几百年。但是，尽管殖民主义者可以把所有掠夺到的东西宣布为他自己的固有财产，历史和印度人民却从来没有承认过这一点。一九五四年，达特拉和纳加拉维尼两地的印度人民作了他们自己权利以内的事情，自己起来解除了当地的葡萄牙殖民武装，宣告了在那里的葡萄牙殖民统治的结束。很明显，印度人民解放这两块领土，只不过是从强盗手中追回了赃物。
    现在，正如俗语所说：“恶人先做头”。这个强盗不但还霸占着一份抢得来的东西不放，居然还要去告状，要求把已经被追回的赃物仍然交给他。这不仅是殖民主义者对印度人民以及一切反殖民主义的人们的一个新的挑衅，也是对海牙国际法院这个国际组织的公然侮辱。
    葡萄牙这个荒谬的行动是在美国国务卿杜勒斯公开支持葡萄牙继续侵占果阿以后发生的。这就说明了：这个强盗所以竟敢如此嚣张，是依仗着有人在给它撑腰。（平）
