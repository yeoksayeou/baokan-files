The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a notice on the 17th concerning carrying out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers during the 1956 New Year and Spring Festival.

The notice states that the New Year and Spring Festival of 1956 are approaching. During this period, all localities should widely carry out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers, focusing on the current central tasks such as the agricultural cooperative movement:

    I.  Universally convene representative meetings or forums of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers at the county, city, or township (village) level. Through these meetings, commend their exemplary deeds, and conduct socialist ideological education and education on agricultural cooperativization issues for them. Encourage them to be at the forefront of the masses in the agricultural cooperative movement, actively participate in agricultural production cooperatives, and play an active backbone role within the cooperatives. For families of revolutionary martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers in cities, mobilize them to actively participate in the socialist transformation of urban capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts; strive to complete production tasks and do their jobs well on various production fronts and work posts. At each representative meeting or forum, review and report on the situation of preferential treatment and resettlement work in the county (city) or township, and solicit opinions from families of revolutionary martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers. Help them appropriately solve specific difficulties in production and life (especially difficulties in joining cooperatives).

    II. In conjunction with the conscription work for new recruits, conduct a review of the resettlement situation of demobilized construction soldiers. Demobilized construction soldiers who have not yet been resettled or whose resettlement is not appropriate should be promptly and properly resettled. And on this basis, prepare for the reception and resettlement of demobilized construction soldiers in 1956.

    III. During the New Year and Spring Festival, all localities should use newspapers, radio stations, propaganda posters, and other means to conduct propaganda and education on supporting the army, giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and the military service law to the broad masses of cadres and people. Mobilize cadres, students, and the broad masses to extend New Year greetings and condolences to local stationed army officers and soldiers, students of revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools, trainees in sanatoriums, patients in hospitals, as well as families of revolutionary martyrs and families of soldiers. In areas where the People's Liberation Army is stationed, or where there are military hospitals and revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools and sanatoriums, military-civilian get-togethers or forums should also be held to further strengthen the relationship between the military and the people, create a mass upsurge in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and raise the social and political status of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers.

    内务部发出关于新年春节拥军优属的通知
    中华人民共和国内务部十七日发出关于一九五六年新年春节期间进行拥军优属活动的通知。
    通知中说，一九五六年的新年和春节就要来到了。各地在此期间应该围绕当前农业合作化运动等中心任务广泛地开展拥军优属活动：
    一、以县、市或以乡（村）为单位普遍召开烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人的代表会议或者座谈会。通过这种会议，表扬他们的模范事迹，对他们进行社会主义的思想教育和农业合作化问题的教育。勉励他们在农业合作化运动中走在群众的前头，积极地参加农业生产合作社，并且在合作社内起积极骨干作用。对城市烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人，要动员他们积极地参加对城市资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造事业；在各个生产战线上和各种工作岗位上努力完成生产任务，做好自己的工作。在各个代表会或座谈会上要检查和报告本县（市）、本乡优抚、复员安置工作的情况，征求烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人的意见。帮助他们适当解决在生产、生活上的具体困难（特别是入社的困难）。
    二、结合新兵的征集工作，对复员建设军人的安置情况进行一次检查。凡是尚未安置的或者安置不妥当的复员建设军人，都应当迅速地给予妥善安置。并且在这一基础上，做好一九五六年接收安置复员建设军人的准备工作。
    三、在新年春节期间，各地应当通过报刊、广播电台、宣传画等方式向广大干部和人民群众进行拥军优属和兵役法的宣传教育。动员干部、学生和广大群众向当地驻军官兵、革命残废军人学校、教养院的学员、休养员、医院中的伤病员以及烈属、军属拜年和慰问。驻有人民解放军的地区，或者驻有部队医院和革命残废军人学校、教养院的地方，还应该召开军民联欢会或者座谈会，进一步密切军民的关系，造成群众拥军优属的热潮，提高烈属、军属、革命残废军人在社会上的政治地位。（新华社）
