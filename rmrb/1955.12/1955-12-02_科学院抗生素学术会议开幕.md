Xinhua News Agency, December 1st. The Chinese Academy of Sciences' 1955 Antibiotics Academic Conference opened in Beijing today. This is a conference closely related to people's health. It will exchange the experience of the scientific community at home and abroad in the research of antibiotics, the most widely used drugs in modern medicine, review China's antibiotics research work, and clearly define the direction of future work.

Today's attendees included Li Xiannian, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council; Li Siguang, Zhu Kezhen, and Wu Youxun, Vice Presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; responsible persons from the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Health, and the Health Department of the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; scientists engaged in antibiotics research and related to antibiotics research from various regions; experts from relevant production departments; and professors from relevant universities, totaling more than 150 people.

Also present today were scientists from the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Japan who were invited to attend the conference, as well as Soviet advisors from the State Council, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Ministry of Health.

Zhu Kezhen delivered the opening speech. He first extended a warm welcome to the foreign scientist representatives invited to attend the conference, and thanked the scientists from various countries who sent congratulatory telegrams to the conference. Zhu Kezhen said that the field of antibiotics research is vast, and there are many aspects of international advanced experience worth learning from. Due to the similarity of certain natural or social factors, many countries with scientist representatives attending today's meeting have many common problems that need to be studied together in scientific research on disease resistance. Zhu Kezhen expressed a warm welcome to foreign scientists to introduce their valuable experiences and provide academic guidance and criticism.

Zhu Kezhen said that people all over the world are striving for peace today, and antibiotics research is a link in the scientific field to strive for the peaceful life of mankind. He said that thanks to the correct leadership and strong support of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, as well as the efforts of Chinese scientists, we have achieved achievements in antibiotics research that could not be achieved in the decades of scientific work before the founding of the People's Republic of China. In recent years, the production and use of antibiotics in China has been rapidly increasing. Taking the production of penicillin as an example, it is estimated that the production in 1955 will be 160 times that of 1952. However, this number is still far from enough compared to the needs of the people. Therefore, strengthening antibiotics research and production is very important for the peaceful life of the Chinese people and all mankind.

Li Xiannian then addressed the meeting. He thanked the antibiotics researchers who have made useful contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland on behalf of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, and welcomed the foreign scientist representatives attending the meeting on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China. Li Xiannian said that the country's socialist construction is advancing at an unprecedented speed and scale, and the people's cultural life will inevitably rise rapidly with it. The people expect scientific workers to meet their needs in science, and the people's need for antibiotics is greatly increasing. We must provide the people with effective and inexpensive antibiotics, and further research new antibiotics to meet the needs of the people. Scientific workers must bravely take on this glorious task, and the Party and the government will give strong support to scientific workers. Li Xiannian encouraged scientific workers in various aspects of antibiotics research to strengthen cooperation and attach importance to international scientific and cultural exchanges.

The foreign scientist representatives invited to attend the meeting all addressed the meeting, congratulating the opening of the conference. They all expressed their great pleasure in working together with the Chinese scientific community in antibiotics research to make greater contributions to the peaceful life of mankind.

Di Jingxiang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Light Industry, made a report entitled "The Preliminary Growth of the Antibiotics Industry and Some Opinions on Antibiotics Research Work" at the meeting. Cui Yitian, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Health, made a report entitled "The Status of Antibiotics in China's Medical and Health Care Undertakings". Dr. Kurilovich from Poland made a report on "The Development and Research of Antibiotics".

The conference is scheduled to last for five days.

Xinhua News Agency: Foreign scientists invited to participate in the 1955 Antibiotics Academic Conference, which began in Beijing on December 1, arrived in Beijing one after another.

From November 26th to 30th, the following have already arrived: Soviet microbiologist Corresponding Academician Krasilnikov and Professor Savich, Polish antibioticologist Dr. Kurilovich, Bulgarian mycologist Dr. Popov, Mongolian microbiologist Alternate Dr. Yalinpir, and Japanese agricultural chemist Dr. Sumiki Yusuke. Academician Nicolaou, a Romanian virologist who is visiting China, and Dr. Nguyen Van Huong, a Vietnamese bacteriologist, will also participate in this conference.

Scientists from North Korea, Burma, and Indonesia have also been invited and will soon come to China to participate in this conference.

    科学院抗生素学术会议开幕
    新华社一日讯　中国科学院一九五五年抗生素学术会议今天在北京开幕。这是一次和人民健康有密切关系的会议，它将要交流国内外科学界对近代药物中应用范围最广泛的药物——抗生素的研究工作的经验，检阅中国的抗生素研究工作，并且明确确定今后的工作方向。
    今天出席会议的有中国共产党中央委员会委员、国务院副总理李先念，中国科学院副院长李四光、竺可桢、吴有训，轻工业部、卫生部、中国人民解放军总后勤部卫生部的负责人，各地从事抗生素研究以及同抗生素研究有关的科学家、有关生产部门的专家和有关高等学校的教授等共一百五十多人。
    今天到会的还有应邀出席会议的苏联、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、蒙古、越南和日本的科学家代表以及国务院、中国科学院和卫生部的苏联顾问。
    竺可桢致开幕词。他首先对应邀出席会议的各外国科学家代表表示热烈欢迎，同时感谢向会议致电祝贺的各国科学家。竺可桢说，抗生素的研究园地是广阔的，国际的先进经验有许多地方值得我们学习。由于某些自然因素或社会因素的相似，在有科学家代表出席今天会议的许多国家中，在抵抗疾病的科学研究上正有着许多共同的问题需要一起研究。竺可桢表示热忱地欢迎外国科学家们介绍他们的宝贵经验，给予学术上的指导和批评。
    竺可桢说，今天全世界人民都在争取和平，抗生素的研究工作是科学领域里为人类和平生活而奋斗的一环。他说，由于中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导和大力支持以及中国科学家的努力，在抗生素研究方面我们已经得到了在中华人民共和国成立以前几十年的科学工作所做不出来的成就。这几年来，中国抗生素的生产量和使用量正在迅速增加，以青霉素的生产量为例，一九五五年预计将为一九五二年的一百六十倍。但是这个数字和人民的需要比较起来还很不够，因此，加强抗生素的研究和生产工作，对中国人民和全人类的和平生活是十分重要的。
    李先念接着在会上致词。他代表中国共产党和人民政府向在祖国的社会主义建设中作出了有益贡献的抗生素研究工作者致谢，并且代表中华人民共和国政府向出席会议的外国科学家代表表示欢迎。李先念说，国家的社会主义建设正在以空前的速度和规模前进着，人民的文化生活也必然随着迅速地高涨，人民期待着科学工作者在科学方面满足他们的需要，人民对抗生素的需要正在大大地增加。我们要供给人民有效的、价廉的抗生素，并且要进一步研究新抗生素，以满足人民的需要。科学工作者必须勇敢地担负起这个光荣的任务来，党和政府将给予科学工作者以有力的支持。李先念勉励从事抗生素研究的各方面的科学工作者要加强合作；要重视国际间的科学文化交流。
    应邀出席会议的外国科学家代表都在会上致词，祝贺这次会议的召开；他们都表示很高兴和中国科学界通力合作从事抗生素的研究工作，为人类的和平生活作出更大的贡献。
    轻工业部副部长狄景襄在会上作了题为“抗生素工业的初步成长和对抗生素研究工作的一些意见”的报告；卫生部副部长崔义田作了题为“抗生素在我国医疗保健事业中的地位”的报告。波兰库里洛维奇博士作了“抗生素的发展与研究”的报告。
    这次会议预定进行五天。
