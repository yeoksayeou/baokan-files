    North China Geological Bureau's 212 Exploration Team
    Completes Annual Drilling Task Forty Days Ahead of Schedule

    Editor:
    Our North China Geological Bureau's 212 Exploration Team has already overfulfilled the entire year's drilling task forty days ahead of schedule on November 21st.
    This year, all our staff members earnestly studied the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, which continuously improved the pure drilling time and footage per unit hour of the drilling rigs. After the No. 505 drilling rig used the "lightweight pipe lifter," it only took 30 minutes to lift all the drilling tools from a hole 500 meters deep. Since October, after the No. 301 drilling rig started using double drill strings, each drilling trip saved half an hour compared to before, the pure drilling time reached 61 percent, and the monthly output per rig reached 326.73 meters. The footage per unit hour of our team in October increased by nearly one time compared to the first quarter.
    In production, we also attached importance to the work of practicing strict economy and opposing waste. According to incomplete statistics, the materials recovered by the Youth Economy Team alone are worth about 800 yuan. The No. 504 drilling rig implemented airport cost accounting, and the unit cost in May and June was reduced by 44 percent compared to the first four months of this year. After the No. 505 drilling rig kept its own drill bits for each shift, the drill bit consumption rate was 47.3 percent lower than the national quota.
    Because we launched the anti-accident struggle, the core sampling rate and rock core sampling rate of the whole team have been greatly improved, and the error in hole depth has also been reduced.
    Currently, all our staff members are further carrying out a labor competition centered on increasing production and practicing economy. We are confident that we will over fulfill the drilling task by another 2,000 meters by the end of this year!

### 华北地质局二一二勘探队  提前四十天完成全年钻探任务

    提前四十天完成全年钻探任务编辑同志：
    我们华北地质局二一二勘探队已经在十一月二十一日提前四十天超额完成了全年的钻探任务。
    今年，我们全体职工认真学习了苏联的先进经验，使钻机的纯钻进时间和单位小时进尺不断提高。五○五号钻机运用了“轻便提管器”以后，只用三十分钟就把孔深五百公尺的钻具全部提完。三○一号钻机从十月份开始使用双套钻具以后，每次提钻时间就比从前节省半个小时，纯钻进时间达到了百分之六十一，台月效率达到了三百二十六点七三公尺。我们队十月份的单位小时进尺就比第一季度提高了将近一倍。
    我们在生产中还重视了厉行节约、反对浪费的工作。根据不完全统计，光是青年节约队拣回来的器材就值八百元左右。五○四号钻机贯彻执行了机场成本核算，五、六月份单位成本比今年头四个月降低了百分之四十四。五○五号钻机每班保管自己使用的钻头以后，使钻头消耗率比国家定额降低了百分之四十七点三。
    由于我们开展了反事故斗争，全队的煤心采取率和岩心采取率大大提高了，孔深的误差也减少了。
    目前，我们全体职工正在进一步地开展以增产节约为中心内容的劳动竞赛。我们有信心要在今年年底再超额完成二千公尺的钻探任务！
