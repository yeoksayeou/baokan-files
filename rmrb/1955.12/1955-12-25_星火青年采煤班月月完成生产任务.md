    Starfire Youth Coal Mining Team Completes Production Tasks Monthly
    To the Editor:
        The Starfire Youth Coal Mining Team is a small team within the Jiang Jun coal mining group of the fourth mining area of the first mine of the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau's Lingdong Mine. Since its establishment in December 1953, this team has exceeded its production plan every month. From May to November this year, the team also saved 183 cubic meters of sleepers, 1,350 detonators, and 656 kilograms of explosives.
    The Starfire Youth Coal Mining Team has consistently emphasized the rational organization of labor in production. At the pre-shift meeting every day, the team leader conveys the day's tasks and introduces the situation at the working face, and then rationally divides the work according to the technical conditions of the workers on duty (because of the rotating shift system); after entering the pit, he also checks everywhere and solves problems in a timely manner. For example, once, because of the large amount of coal produced, the pushcart workers couldn't keep up, while the coal loaders still had potential. The team leader immediately reallocated the workforce to ensure balanced production.
    Before April of this year, although the Starfire Youth Coal Mining Team exceeded its production tasks every month, its raw material consumption exceeded its budget every month. After learning from the advanced experience of the team economic accounting system, support worker Zhang Lihang and others strengthened the pit wood recovery work, making the pit wood recovery rate reach 80% to 90% (the specified target is 60%); blasting worker Kong Qingfeng took the initiative to find the blasters to study the reasons for the waste of explosives, and proposed a new drilling method—the "three-flower" drilling method, which expanded the distance between blastholes, reduced the number of holes and the amount of explosives loaded in each hole, thus greatly reducing the consumption of detonators and explosives. Thus, after May, the Starfire Youth Coal Mining Team also achieved great results in saving.

### 星火青年采煤班月月完成生产任务

    星火青年采煤班月月完成生产任务编辑同志：
    星火青年采煤班是双鸭山矿务局岭东矿一井四采区姜俊采煤组的一个小班。这个班从一九五三年十二月成立以来到现在，每个月都超额完成了生产计划。从今年五月到十一月，这个班还节约了枕木一百八十三立方公尺，雷管一千三百五十个和火药六百五十六公斤。
    星火青年采煤班在生产中一贯重视合理组织劳动力的工作。班长在每天的坑前会议上都要传达当天的任务和介绍掌子的情况，然后根据当班出勤人员的技术条件（因为是轮休制）进行合理分工；进坑以后又到处检查，发现问题就及时解决。如有一次因为出煤多，推车的干不过来，而装煤的还有潜力。班长马上重新调配力量，保证了均衡生产。
    在今年四月以前，星火青年采煤班虽然生产任务月月超额完成了，但是原材料消耗却月月超支。在学习了班组经济核算制的先进经验以后，支柱工张立航等加强了坑木回收工作，使坑木回收率达到百分之八十到九十（规定的指标是百分之六十）；打眼工孔庆峰主动找放炮工研究火药浪费的原因，提出新的打眼方法——“三花式”打眼法，扩大了炮眼的距离，减少了眼数和每眼的装药量，因此大大地降低了雷管和火药的消耗量。这样，在五月份以后，星火青年采煤班在节约方面也获得了很大的成绩。
