    Another Pair of New-Type Coal Mine Shafts Begins Production
    Jilin Province "Xi'an Worker's Newspaper" Editorial Department
    The Liaoyuan Coal Mine Central Shaft, a key construction project in China's first Five-Year Plan, was officially handed over for production on December 1st. This is a modern shaft built according to the model of the new-type Donbass shafts in the Soviet Union. Its handover to production marks a new victory for our country in socialist industrialization.
    Construction of the Liaoyuan Central Shaft began in November 1950. Thanks to the help of Soviet experts and the tireless efforts of all workers, engineers, and technicians, the project, which would have taken more than a dozen years to complete in a capitalist country, was completed in just five years. On the 60,000-square-meter ground square, a pair of steel derricks, each 40 meters high, have been erected, along with main and auxiliary shaft hoist platforms, regional substations, wind pump rooms, railway coal bunkers, ventilator rooms, air heating rooms, sand warehouses, grease warehouses, mechanical repair shops, prop processing plants, and a three-story administrative and welfare complex building serving production. Below the shaft, there are dozens of kilometers of roadways and five kilometers of underground "avenues," with central substations, electric locomotive depots, traffic control rooms, fire train depots, pump rooms, mud pump rooms, water reservoirs, settling ponds, coal bunkers, powder magazines, employee waiting rooms, clinics, and various machines supplied by the Soviet Union. These machines are the finest and most precise in the world.
    The entire production process of this shaft is mechanized. When workers go down the shaft, they can reach a depth of more than 500 meters below the surface in an instant by riding in a safe cage. The underground roadways are interconnected, and the railways crisscross, with as many vehicles coming and going as trains in a large train marshalling station. Because there is a unified automatic traffic control signal, the trains run in an orderly manner. When mining coal, the workers no longer have to laboriously dig coal with clumsy picks as they did in the past, nor do they have to shovel coal into mine cars one shovel at a time, let alone push the mine cars manually. They use the world's best coal mining machinery - the combined coal mining machine and coal cutter from the Soviet Union. The driver operates the combined coal mining machine to cut the coal from the coal wall piece by piece and automatically crush the large pieces of coal and send them to the scraper conveyor on the working face. The coal is automatically transported to the coal cars by belt conveyors in the roadways, and then the electric locomotive pulls the coal cars away. This type of electric locomotive does not require overhead wires; once it is fully charged with electricity and gas in the underground charging room and gas filling room, it can pull eighteen coal cars at a time (each coal car carrying three tons of coal). It takes only sixty-one minutes to complete a cycle from the mining area to the car yard. When the coal car arrives at the coal bunker, it automatically dumps the coal into the bunker. The main shaft has a skip that can lift several tons of coal at a time. When the worker on the shaft presses the button, the skip automatically descends to the bottom of the shaft and opens the coal bunker. After being filled with coal, it automatically sends a signal. The worker on the shaft presses the button again, and the skip rises. After the coal is lifted to the shaft entrance, it is sent to the automatic coal washing machine. After the raw coal comes out of the coal washing machine, it is divided into lump coal and pulverized coal, and the stones in the coal are also automatically selected. Finally, the selected coal is still automatically loaded onto trains bound for various places.
    In this pair of modern shafts, there are many new devices for preventing accidents. In order to eliminate the harm of gas to workers, the Liaoyuan Central Shaft is equipped with huge ventilators. The main roadways all have two air ducts, so workers can breathe enough fresh air when working underground. The huge wind force can also dilute the coal dust and gas in the air to prevent explosions. The shaft is also equipped with modern sprinkler equipment, fire prevention equipment, and drainage equipment. In the severe winter, in order to prevent the underground workers from freezing, the air heating room heats the air before sending it underground. The cage falling is the most dangerous accident in the mine, but in the central shaft, because there is an automatic drop insurance device, it can automatically jam the falling cage.
    During the construction of the Liaoyuan Central Shaft, from design to construction, it received comprehensive and systematic fraternal assistance from the Soviet Union in terms of manpower and material resources. The Soviet Union not only designed this new type of mine for us according to the model of the Donbass shaft, but also manufactured a large number of new machines for us and sent experts to directly guide the construction. In the early stage of shaft construction, before the Soviet experts arrived, we adopted very backward shaft construction methods: rock drilling and wall lining were carried out separately; workers used hand hammers to drill holes, manually loaded gangue, and used clumsy baskets to lift stones and soil, resulting in very low work efficiency. After the Soviet expert Comrade Shimanko came, he proposed that rock drilling and wall lining of the shaft should be carried out in parallel operations. Under the expert's personal guidance, a new record of comprehensive monthly progress of 56 meters was created at that time in shaft excavation. As a result, the shaft construction task was completed in only twenty-two months, five years faster than originally planned. After the horizontal roadway operation began, expert Pustovetov proposed the suggestion of parallel operation of horizontal roadways and suggested launching a labor competition of 100 meters per month. As a result, from August 16 to September 15, 1953, the comprehensive monthly progress increased by more than double the average monthly progress from January to July. The experts showed a great spirit of internationalism in helping us build this new type of shaft. When erecting the derrick, experts such as Shafchenko came to the site early in the morning to check various preparatory work. To ensure safety, Comrade Shafchenko personally climbed to the hoisting tower, which was more than 40 meters high, to check whether the rope buckle was strong. From morning to 5 p.m., he did not go back to eat until the derrick was safely erected.
    It is conceivable that the construction of such a modern, large-scale shaft was arduous and complex. We had no experience in building new-type mines, and the workers who undertook the construction of this pair of shafts were transferred from inclined shafts and came from rural areas. Most of them had never seen shafts, let alone had actual shaft construction experience. Therefore, in the early stage of excavating the shaft, the work efficiency was very low, and the average daily excavation volume only reached 0.63 meters to 0.75 meters. At that time, some workers said: We are young men when we start digging the well, and we will become white-bearded old men when we finish digging the well. However, difficulties cannot stop determined people. The employees who built the shaft constantly overcame difficulties, learned new technologies, and completed the task of building a modern shaft. When excavating the shaft, the expert suggested parallel operation and also suggested drilling deep holes. However, the workers were not skilled in the technology of drilling deep holes, and forty or fifty drill bits had to be clamped for each hole. Comrade Gu Faming, a Communist Party member, led all the workers in the rock drilling team to learn the method of replacing drill bits in series to drill holes. Comrade Gu Faming also improved the drill bit head and added a steel wire ring inside the air hole to overcome the difficulty of clamping the drill bit. They also implemented advanced experience such as the flow operation method of drilling holes, which shortened the time for exhausting the smoke from the artillery, thus greatly improving the rock drilling efficiency. In the past, it took 16 hours to drill a one-meter-deep hole and fire one shot, but later it only took three hours to drill a two-meter-deep hole and fire one shot. When building the administrative and welfare complex building, it was winter, and construction was carried out in the open air. Hands would become numb after being stretched out for a while, and pebbles and sand were frozen into ice slag, and the mortar also solidified. However, the workers conscientiously implemented the expert's suggestions and did a good job in insulation. The sand, stones, and sawdust were all heated with fire. In order to prevent the mortar from freezing, the workers made two layers of wooden buckets to hold the mortar (with hot water in the middle). The installation of shaft equipment was the most difficult project in the installation of shaft equipment. In the severe cold weather, standing in a narrow cage was both cold and difficult to work. When the pneumatic pick was frozen and could not be started, the workers put it in their arms to warm it; when their palms were frozen and could not work, they breathed hot air on them and continued to work.
    Since the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement in June this year, the youths who built the shaft have organized 19 youth economy teams, which have recovered waste materials worth more than 130,000 yuan. From January to September this year, they have saved the state more than 499,000 yuan in funds from reducing non-productive projects and lowering project costs. The workers treat the country's wealth as if it were their own. Liang Rong, a worker in the transportation section, has been picking up nails on the ground and taking them home every day after work since last year. After straightening the bent nails, he hands them over to the warehouse. He hands over about three kilograms of good nails to the warehouse every day.
    In order to hand over the central shaft for production as soon as possible, the existing production units such as Fuguo No. 2 Mine and No. 3 Mine of the Xi'an Mining Bureau have given great support. The roadways built by Fuguo No. 3 Mine alone account for about one-tenth of the entire roadway length of the central shaft. Dozens of factories and mines across the country rushed to manufacture some equipment and materials for the central shaft and trained production personnel.

    又一对新型煤矿竖井开始生产了
    吉林省“西安工人报”编辑部
    我国第一个五年计划中的重要建设项目——辽源煤矿中央竖井已经于十二月一日正式移交生产了。这是按照苏联顿巴斯新型竖井的样子建设起来的一座现代化竖井。它的移交生产，标志着我国在社会主义工业化建设中又获得了一个新的胜利。
    辽源中央竖井是一九五○年十一月开工的。由于苏联专家的帮助和全体工人、工程技术人员夜以继日地辛勤劳动，只用了五年的时间就完成了在资本主义国家需要十几年才能完成的工程。在六万平方公尺的地面广场上，已经耸立起一对高达四十公尺的钢铁井架和为生产服务的主副井绞车台、地区变电所、风泵房、铁路煤仓、扇风机房、空气加热室、砂仓、油脂仓库、机械修理厂、支柱加工厂，以及一座三层的行政福利联合大楼。在井筒下面有数十公里的巷道和五公里长的地下“大街”，井下有中央变电所、电机车库、行车指挥室、防火列车库、水泵房、泥泵房、水仓、沉淀池、煤仓、火药库、职工候车室、医疗所等，以及苏联供给我们的各种机器。这些机器都是世界上第一流的最精密的机器。
    这座竖井的全部生产过程是机械化的。工人下井工作的时候，只要乘上安全的罐笼，一瞬间就可以到达距离地面五百多公尺深的井下。井下的巷道四通八达，铁路纵横交错，来往的车辆像一个大的火车编组车站里的火车一样多。因为有统一的自动的行车指挥信号，列车行走有条不紊。采煤的时候，工人们再不像从前那样用笨镐吃力地刨煤，也不用一铲一铲地把煤装到矿车里，更不用人工来推矿车。他们用的是世界上最好的采煤机械——来自苏联的联合采煤机和截煤机。司机操纵着联合采煤机一片一片地把煤从煤壁上割下来，并且自动地把大块煤打碎送到场子面上的刮板运输机上。煤经过巷道里的皮带运输机自动运到煤车上，然后电机车头又把煤车拉走。这种电机车不需要架电线，只要在井下充电室和充气室充足了电、气以后，一次就能拉十八辆煤车（每辆煤车装三吨煤）。从采区到车场子循环一次，只需要六十一分钟。煤车到达煤仓，就自动地把煤倒到煤仓里。主井上有一个一次可提升数吨煤的箕斗，经井上的工人一按电钮，箕斗就自动地下到井底并且冲开煤仓，装满煤后就自动发出信号，井上的工人再一按电钮，箕斗就上升。煤被提到井口后又被送到自动选煤机里。原煤从选煤机出来以后，被分成块煤和粉煤，煤里的石头也被自动挑选出来。这些选出来的煤，最后仍然是自动地装上运往各地的火车。
    在这对现代化竖井里，有很多新的防止事故发生的设备。辽源中央竖井为了消除瓦斯对工人的危害，设置了巨大的扇风机。主要巷道都有两条风道，工人在井下工作可以呼吸到足够的新鲜空气。巨大的风力又能冲淡空气中的煤尘和瓦斯，以免发生爆炸事故。井下还设有现代化的洒水设备、防火设备和排水设备。在严寒的冬季，为了使井下工人不受冻，空气加热室把空气加热后再送到井下。罐笼坠落是矿井中最危险的事故，但是在中央竖井因为有自动装置的降落保险器，可以自动把正在坠落的罐笼卡住。
    在辽源中央竖井的建设过程中，从设计到施工，在人力和物力方面，都得到了苏联全面的系统的兄弟般的援助。苏联不仅按照顿巴斯竖井的样子给我们设计了这座新型矿井，还为我们制造了大批新型的机器，并且派专家直接指导施工。在井筒建设初期，苏联专家还没有来的时候，我们采用的建井方法是很落后的：凿岩和砌壁是分开进行的；工人们用手锤打眼，用人工装矸子，用笨筐提升石头和泥土，工作效率很低。苏联专家石曼阔同志来了以后，提出了井筒的凿岩和砌壁要实行平行作业。在专家亲自指导下，创造了综合月进五十六公尺的当时井筒开凿的新纪录。结果，仅用二十二个月的时间就完成了井筒建设任务，较原计划加快了五年。开始平巷作业后，普斯多维托夫专家又提出平巷平行作业的建议，并且建议开展月进百公尺的劳动竞赛。结果由一九五三年八月十六日到九月十五日，综合月进度较一至七月份平均月进度提高了一倍以上。专家们在帮助我们建设这对新型的竖井的时候，表现了伟大的国际主义精神。在起立井架的时候，沙夫琴克等专家一早就来到现场，检查各项准备工作。为了保证安全，沙夫琴克同志亲自爬到四十多公尺高的提升塔上去检查绳扣是否结实。从早上到下午五点钟，直到井架安全地立起来，他才回去吃饭。
    建设这样一座现代化规模巨大的竖井，工程的艰巨复杂是可以想像得出的。我们没有建设新型矿井的经验，承担建设这对竖井的工人们又都是从斜井调来的和从农村来的，他们绝大部分都没有看见过竖井，更不用说实际建井经验了，因此，在开凿井筒初期，工作效率很低，平均每天掘进量只达零点六三公尺到零点七五公尺。当时有的工人说：咱们打井的时候是小伙子，打完井就要变成白胡子老头了。但是，困难挡不住有毅力的人，建设竖井的职工们不断地克服了困难，学习新的技术，完成了建设现代化竖井的任务。在开凿井筒的时候，专家在建议平行作业的同时，还建议打深眼。但是，工人们不熟练打深眼的技术，打一遍眼要夹住四、五十根钎子。共产党员谷发明同志领导掘岩组的全体工人，学习了套钎子接替打眼的方法。谷发明同志又改进了钎子头，在风眼内加钢丝圈，克服了夹钎子的困难。他们又实行了打眼的流水作业法等先进经验，缩短了排炮烟的时间，因而大大提高了凿岩效率。过去打一公尺深的眼，放一遍炮需要十六小时，以后打二公尺深的眼，放一遍炮仅三小时就够了。建设行政福利联合大楼的时候，正是冬季，在露天里施工，手伸出去一会儿就冻麻了，石子、砂子都冻成了冰楂，灰浆也凝固起来了。但是，工人们认真执行了专家的建议，做好保温工作，砂子、石头、锯沫子等都用火烤热。为了使灰浆不受冻，工人们做了两层的木桶盛灰浆，（中间放热水）。井筒设备安装是竖井设备安装中最困难的工程，在严寒的天气里，站在狭小的罐笼中，又冷又难工作。当风镐被冻得不能开动的时候，工人们就把它放在怀里来暖它；手掌冻得没法干活了，就用嘴呵呵热气，又继续工作。
    今年六月增产节约运动开展以后，建设竖井的青年们组织了十九个青年节约队，回收了价值十三万多元的废器材。今年一至九月份，从削减非生产性工程、降低工程造价等方面，给国家节约了四十九万九千多元的资金。工人们对待国家的财富像自己家的东西一样。运搬段工人梁荣，从去年开始，每天下班时都把丢在地上的钉子拣起来，并且带回家去，把弯了的钉子打直以后再交给仓库。他每天都交给仓库三公斤左右的好钉子。
    为了使中央竖井早日移交生产，西安矿务局富国二坑、三坑等现有生产单位，都给予了大力支援。仅富国三坑帮助建设的巷道，就约占中央竖井整个巷道长度的十分之一。全国各地有数十个厂矿为中央竖井赶制了部分设备和材料，以及培训生产人员。
