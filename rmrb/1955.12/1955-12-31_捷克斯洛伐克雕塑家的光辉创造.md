The Brilliant Creations of Czechoslovak Sculptors
Hua Tianyou

Stepping into the Czechoslovakian Republic's Exhibition of Plastic Arts, I was immediately met with over four hundred pieces of Czechoslovakian art from the thirteenth century to the present day, leaving me overwhelmed. After appreciating them one by one, I came to genuinely love them.

Because I love sculpture, I paid more attention to the exhibited sculptures. What first caught my attention here was V. Dobrovolná’s bust portrait of the great leader of the Czechoslovak people, Comrade Gottwald. This is a successful work. The artist used a simple, realistic technique to meticulously sculpt the noble, firm, and confident spirit of the people's leader. With his left hand resting on a book and his right hand slightly extended towards the masses, it immediately reminded people of all the leader's correct statements and instructions, filling them with respect. Jan Lauda's portrait of President Zápotocký is of a high artistic level. The author masterfully completed this work with a bold, precise, and skilled technique. The portrait, with its slightly lowered head, spirited eyes, and smiling lips, truthfully depicts the people's leader constantly pondering and planning for the bright future of the people's happy life. K. Pokorný's "Making Friends" expresses an extraordinary and sincere enthusiasm and a great spirit of internationalism through the touching image of a Czech guerrilla fighter warmly embracing a Soviet Red Army soldier. I greatly admire this work but regret not being able to see the enlarged version.

Many sculptures depict the lives of the working people. J. Koestka’s "Cooperative Member" is a popular work. The author depicts a rural girl, wearing thin clothes, holding a handful of straw rope twisted together, ready to bundle the harvested crops. She looks up, smiling, into the distance. Although there is no background, it is clear that she is in the midst of a busy harvest, filled with the joy of work and yearning for a happy future. This work has an even more inspiring effect on us, who are currently engaged in a vigorous cooperative movement. M. Sette's wood carving "Volunteer Laborer" depicts a young laborer, during his rest time, still carrying a shovel, tirelessly and victoriously completing his extra work. A conscious and voluntary spirit of labor and a strong confidence in the socialist construction strongly infect the audience.

In addition, there are many reliefs that attract the attention of the audience. For example, the two reliefs "The Great October Revolution," a collaboration between Mayerová and Sturubacki for the Prague Lenin Museum, adopts a form similar to Chinese wood carvings. One vividly depicts Lenin and his comrades discussing revolutionary work, while the other touchingly depicts Stalin and his comrades grieving solemnly and solemnly swearing an oath before Lenin's mausoleum. These two works not only cleverly arrange the scenes and the expressions and demeanor of the characters but also well design the reliefs themselves, making people willing to take them home and hang them up for appreciation at any time. These creative and excellent works of art make us feel as if we have personally seen the vigorous new force among our brother country Czechoslovakia's many outstanding sculptors and carving artists, and seen them serving socialist construction towards a common goal, which is truly admirable.

Indeed, from this exhibition, we have a brief understanding of the history of Czechoslovak sculpture. As early as the fourteenth century, Bo. Balosh’s statue of "King Charles IV" was a very vivid sculptural work of art. In particular, the world-renowned master Jo. Va. Meisebek left many exemplary works. For example, he used a sensitive technique to meticulously carve out the personality of the lively and robust horse "Addo"; his self-portrait used a powerful expression method to carve out his own deeply known inner life. From the space between the portrait's eyebrows and forehead, it can be seen how much arduous ideological labor he has undergone, and his bright eyes show his perseverance; his four saint statues are all small drafts of less than three inches, but the precision of the expressions allows people to see that they are monumental sculptures. This is truly a very powerful realist sculpture master. His student, the contemporary sculpture master Jan Stursa's portrait of "Female Writer Bo. Niemezova" is truly a representative work that inherited and developed his excellent tradition. Others, such as Bo. Kafka's "Little Deer" and Yo. Mashatka's "Composer Dvořák", "Symphony" and "Hand", all show that they have successively accepted the nation's excellent traditions.

Czechoslovak sculpture art has a long history of realism, and with the continuous efforts and creations of modern sculptors, it is advancing on the path of socialist realism. We are very grateful for the successful exhibition, which has given us the opportunity to see the brilliant creations of the respected sculptors of the Czechoslovak Republic and the opportunity to learn from them.

    捷克斯洛伐克雕塑家的光辉创造
    滑田友
    走进捷克斯洛伐克共和国造型艺术展览会的门，迎面看到四百多件捷克斯洛伐克从十三世纪一直到最近的各种造型艺术作品，一时使我感到应接不暇，逐一欣赏之后，更使我由衷地喜爱它们。
    因为我爱好雕塑，所以更多地注意了展出的雕塑作品。这里首先引起我注意的就是维·多勃罗伏尔纳所作的捷克斯洛伐克人民伟大的领袖哥特瓦尔德同志的半身肖像。这是一个成功的作品，作家用一种朴素的写实手法，细致地塑造出人民领袖高尚的、坚定的和充满信心的精神，左手按着一本书，右手向群众微伸，叫人一看就回忆到领袖的一切正确言论和指示，而感到崇敬。扬·劳达所作的萨波托斯基总统的肖像，具有高度的艺术水平，作者用一种豪放的精确的熟练手法，卓越地完成了这个作品，肖像微低着头，精神饱满的眼睛，微笑着的嘴唇，真实地表现了人民的领袖时刻在为人民幸福生活的远景而深思、策划。卡·波克尔内的“交朋友”，通过一位捷克游击队战士和一位苏联红军战士热烈拥抱的动人形象，表现出一种不平凡的真挚的热情和伟大的国际主义精神。对于这件作品，我非常喜爱，但是不能亲见放大的作品而感到遗憾。
    许多雕塑作品，表现了劳动人民的生活。约·柯斯得卡的“合作社社员”，是很受观众欢迎的作品，作者表现一个农村的少女，穿着薄薄的衣裳，拿着一把禾草拧成的粗索，准备捆束割下的庄稼，抬着头，含着微笑，望着远方，虽然没有背景，但一看就知道她是正在忙忙收割的环境中，充满着工作的愉快，而且向往着未来的幸福。这个作品，对于正在轰轰烈烈地进行合作化运动中的我们，更有着鼓舞的作用。米·塞特的木雕“义务劳动者”，表现一个青年劳动者，在休息的时间里，却还掮着一把铁锹，毫不疲倦地胜利地完成他额外的工作，一种自觉自愿的劳动情绪和对于社会主义建设充满着胜利的信心，强烈地感染着观众。
    此外，还有不少浮雕，很吸引观众的注意。如马叶罗娃和斯杜鲁白茨基两人合作的布拉格列宁博物馆的两幅浮雕“伟大的十月革命”，采用了同中国木雕相似的形式，在一幅中生动地表现出列宁和他的战友们正在谈论着革命的工作，而在另一幅中又感人地表现出斯大林和他的战友们在列宁的陵墓前沉痛地悼念和庄严地宣誓，这两幅作品，不仅巧妙地安排了场面和人物的表情、神态，并且很好地设计了浮雕的本身，叫人乐意拿来挂在自己的家里好随时欣赏。这些富有创造性的优秀的艺术作品，让我们好像亲眼见到了我们的兄弟国家捷克斯洛伐克那样多杰出的雕刻家和雕刻作者中蓬蓬勃勃的新生力量，而且看到他们向着一个共同的目标为社会主义建设服务，实在令人赞美。
    的确，从这次展出作品中，我们概要地了解了捷克斯洛伐克的雕塑历史。远在十四世纪，波·巴洛许作的“查理王第四”像，就是很生动的雕塑艺术作品。尤其是世界闻名的大师约·瓦·梅塞倍克留下了很多的典范作品，例如他把那样活泼而健壮的“阿多”马，用灵敏的手法，细致地刻划出了它的性格来；他的自雕像，又用一种有力的表现方法，刻划出他自己所深知的内在生活，从肖像的眉头和额角之间，看出他是经过了多么艰苦的思想劳动，炯炯两眼更表现了他坚忍不拔的精神；他的四圣像都是不出三寸的小稿，而神态的精确，却可以使人看出是纪念碑的雕刻。这真是一位极有魄力的现实主义的雕塑大师。他的学生、当代雕塑大师杨·史杜尔塞所作的“女作家波·聂梅茨娃”的肖像，实在是他的优秀传统的承继而又加以发展了的代表作品。其他如波·卡夫卡的“小鹿”，约·马沙特卡的“作曲家德沃夏克”、“交响曲”和“手”等，都可以看出他们一脉相继地接受了民族优秀的传统。
    捷克斯洛伐克的雕塑艺术是有悠久的现实主义的历史的，加以现代雕塑家们不断地努力创造，正在社会主义现实主义的道路上迈进。我们非常感谢这次展览会成功的展出，他使我们有机会看到了敬爱的捷克斯洛伐克共和国雕塑家们的光辉创造，并有机会向他们学习。（附图片）
