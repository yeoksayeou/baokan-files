A Cultured Remote Mountain Valley

    To the Editor:
    Dihe Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, is a remote mountain valley. Before liberation, only three out of 738 people in the township were literate. If a family wanted to write a letter or get a note, they had to travel several miles to ask someone to write it for them. Now, the situation is very different. The township has three permanent civil schools. More than 200 young adults have learned between 300-400 to 600-700 characters. These people now serve as agricultural cooperative cadres, accountants, and work recorders.
    Dihe Township has a library with eight hundred popular books on current affairs, politics, natural sciences, agricultural technology, hygiene knowledge, and literature. Whenever it is open, the library is packed with people. In addition to reading in the library, farmers also borrow books to take home and read. These popular books not only consolidate the farmers' learning achievements but also enable farmers to learn many things. For example, after Yang Jinchang read a book introducing how to use a double-wheeled double-shared plow, he experimented with it this autumn during the autumn plowing season, and the result was deeper and flatter plowing. Also, when the finance and grain director Yang Daqi read a book about unified purchase and sale, he was able to explain the policy clearly and answer questions from the masses when publicizing the unified purchase and sale policy.
    The entire township subscribes to more than thirty newspapers, including the Shanxi Daily, Farmer's Daily, and Shanxi Youth. Thirteen newspaper reading groups are organized according to production units. They bring newspapers to the fields, and read during breaks. In July of this year, the township also got a radio. Every evening after dinner, men and women run to the township government to listen to the broadcast.
    The youth in the township also organized an entertainment group, and enthusiastically carry out entertainment activities during breaks. Their performances at this year's National Day celebration were well received by the audience. The villagers in the surrounding townships all praised them saying: Dihe Township is advanced in production, and its cultural work is also doing very well!

The Learning Day in Beitang Township

    To the Editor:
    Beitang Township, Xixia County, Henan Province, stipulates that every even-numbered day is the township's learning day. Whenever the clock strikes after lunch on a learning day, the farmers put down other things, walk into the civil school, and concentrate on reading. Cultural learning has already formed a climax in Beitang Township!
    This autumn, the members of the fourteen agricultural cooperatives in the township studied Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperation. They saw the prospects of agricultural collectivization and mechanization, and were very excited. However, how can illiterate people operate machinery in the future? Cooperative member Zhang Wanling said: "When it comes to using machines in the future, we old illiterates will just be dumbfounded!" According to the demands of the vast number of cooperative members, the Beitang Township Party Branch of the Chinese Communist Party formulated a cultural learning plan for the entire township while carrying out cooperative planning. Under the leadership of the Party branch, eleven civil schools were established in the township, organized by cooperative. Six hundred and twenty-one people participated in the learning, of which more than 90% were young adults. The students put forward a loud slogan: "Strive to be a model in production! We must also fight a beautiful battle in cultural learning!"
    These people, who yearn for socialism and are unwilling to be "illiterate" anymore, not only strictly abide by the learning day system but also squeeze out time to learn anytime and anywhere. The members of the First Agricultural Cooperative also brought textbooks when they went to the fields to pick up rice stubble, and took out their books to read and write during breaks, working busily. Xue Xiuhua, a young woman from this agricultural cooperative, took her textbooks when she returned to her mother's home and went to the civil school of the Seventh Agricultural Cooperative to study. The members of the Eighth Agricultural Cooperative also brought textbooks when they went to the river to repair the dikes. They said: "Ensure that learning does not lag behind, and come back still keeping up!" Qiao Jianyun, who participated in the senior primary school class, worked in the cooperative all day, and still bent over his desk doing arithmetic problems when he returned home from work at night. He said: "No matter how tired I am, I have to do my homework before I rest." White-haired old people, watching their children and grandchildren study so hard, said with envious smiles: Their generation is so happy!

A Mother of Five Learning Culture

    To the Editor:
    Yan Zhaozhi, a student at the Dongguan Village Civil School in Yutian County, Hebei Province, is a mother of five children. Her husband is away at work, and she needs to raise all five children by herself. Therefore, in the past, she had been busy taking care of her children and did not attend civil school. Last year, her whole family joined the agricultural cooperative. Her eldest brother worked as a warehouse keeper in the cooperative, and both her sisters-in-law worked as pig feeders in the cooperative. During the wheat harvest this year, she used a paper slip for recording work points as cigarette paper to smoke because she was illiterate, which was only discovered when the cooperative distributed wheat. Therefore, she had the idea of ​​learning culture well in her heart. In October of this year, the cooperative leader mobilized women to attend winter school, and she signed up!
    Yan Zhaozhi has so many children, the youngest is only two years old, how does she persevere in learning? First of all, she united well with her sister-in-law Gao Xiulan and made a clear division of labor for housework: like the work of feeding pigs, Zhaozhi is in charge in the morning, and Xiulan is in charge in the evening; the work of cooking is also divided in this way. Secondly, she tried to arrange the work of the children before lunch, and concentrated the afternoon time for learning. After dinner, she laid out the children's bedding and prepared toys, and let her eldest daughter help take care of her younger brothers and sisters, and she went to school herself. In this way, since school started, she has never been absent from a class.
    Yan Zhaozhi works very hard at studying. She regards her daughter and her older brother and sister-in-law as teachers, and asks them for advice at any time, regardless of whether it is early or late. Whether she is cooking or feeding pigs, she also holds a book and reads whenever she has time; even when she is walking, she keeps reading new words. Her younger sister-in-law said: "Sister-in-law has simply become a 'learning fanatic'."
    Yan Zhaozhi has achieved good results since she joined the learning program for more than two months. She has not only recognized the names of her family members, but also remembered some new words related to agricultural production and farm tools. Recently, the civil school teacher praised her and encouraged mothers to learn from her. Yan Zhaozhi made a guarantee, saying: "I will definitely persevere in learning and strive to write a letter to my husband myself after the autumn of 1956 to report the good news of the cooperative's bumper harvest."

    掀起学习文化的热潮
    一个有文化的偏僻山沟编辑同志：
    山西省平顺县底河乡是一个偏僻的山沟。在解放以前，全乡七百三十八人中只有三个人识字，谁家要写封信或开个条子，就得跑好几里地去求人代笔。现在，情况可大不相同了。全乡有了三座常年民校。有二百多名青壮年已经学会了三、四百字到六、七百字。这些人现在分别担任着农业社社务干部，会计员和记工员的工作。
    底河乡有一个图书室，里边有时事政治、自然科学、农业技术、卫生常识和文艺等各方面的通俗读物共八百多本。每逢开放的时候，图书室就挤满了人。农民们除了在图书室里读书以外，还借书回家去看。这些通俗读物不但巩固了农民的学习成果，同时也使农民学到了很多东西。像杨进昌读了介绍如何使用双轮双铧犁的书以后，今年秋耕的时候就试验使用，结果犁得又深又平。又像财粮主任杨大起看了关于统购统销的书，宣传统购统销政策的时候就能够讲清道理，解答群众的疑问。
    全乡订有山西日报、农民报、山西青年等各种报纸共三十多份，并且按生产单位组织了十三个读报组，上地的时候带上报，休息的时候就读。今年七月间，乡里又有了收音机。每天晚饭以后，男男女女都跑到乡政府来听广播。
    乡里的青年们还组织了一个文娱组，每逢休息时间就热烈地开展文娱活动。他们在今年国庆节的庆祝会上的表演，得到了观众的好评。周围几个乡的老乡们都称赞说：底河乡生产先进，文化工作也搞得真好！
                            郭青松　冯元镇北堂乡的学习日编辑同志：
    河南省西峡县北堂乡规定，每一个逢双的日子，就是乡里的学习日。每当学习日的午饭后，钟声一响，农民们放下其他的事，走进了民校，就专心地读起书来。文化学习，在北堂乡已经形成了高潮！
    今年秋季，全乡十四个农业社的社员们学习了毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示。他们看到了农业集体化、机械化的远景，十分兴奋。但是，睁眼瞎子将来怎么摆弄机器呢？社员张万灵就说：“将来使机器，咱这老粗可干瞪眼了！”中共北堂乡党支部根据广大社员的要求，在进行合作化规划的同时，制定了全乡的文化学习规划。在党支部领导下，全乡按社为单位办了十一所民校。参加学习的有六百二十一人，其中青壮年占百分之九十以上。学员们提出了响亮的口号：“在生产上争取当模范！在文化学习上也要打个漂亮仗！”
    这些向往着社会主义、不愿再当“睁眼瞎子”的人们，除了严格地遵守学习日制度以外，还随时随地挤出时间来学习。第一农业社的社员们，上地拾稻茬也带着课本，休息的时候就拿出书本，读呀、写呀，忙个不停。这个农业社的青年妇女薛秀花回娘家，就把课本带上，到第七农业社民校学习。第八农业社社员们上河修堤也带上课本。他们说：“保证学习不掉队，回来仍然跟上班！”参加高小班学习的乔建云，在社里做一天活，天黑收工回来还伏在桌子上做算术题。他说：“再累，也得做好功课再休息。”花白胡子的老人们，看着自己的儿孙们这样努力学习，都带着羡慕的笑容说：他们这一代，可真幸福呢！
                河南省西峡县北堂乡　封光铣五个孩子的母亲学文化编辑同志：
    河北省玉田县东关村民校学员阎兆芝，是一个有着五个孩子的母亲。她丈夫在外面参加工作，五个孩子都需要她一个人来抚育。因此，过去她一直忙于看管小孩，没有上民校学习。去年，她全家入了农业社，大哥在社里当保管员，妯娌俩都在社里当了喂猪员。今年麦秋中，她由于不识字，把记工分的纸条当废纸卷烟抽了，直到社里分麦子的时候才发现。因此，她心里就有了学好文化的念头。今年十月，社长动员妇女上冬学，她就报名了！
    阎兆芝的孩子这么多，最小的才两岁，她是怎样坚持学习的呢？首先，她同嫂嫂高秀兰搞好了团结，对家务劳动作了明确分工：像喂猪的活，早晨由兆芝管，晚上就由秀兰管；做饭的活也这样分了工。其次，她把孩子们身上的活计尽量安排在午饭以前做好，把下午的时间集中用来学习。晚饭以后，她把孩子们的被褥铺好，玩具准备好，让大女儿帮助看管弟弟、妹妹们，自己就去上学。就这样，开学以来，她从来没有旷过一回课。
    阎兆芝对学习非常努力。她把自己的女儿和哥嫂都当成老师，不管早晚，有问题就随时向他们请教。无论在做饭或喂猪的时候，她也拿着书本，抽空就念；甚至在走道的时候，她嘴里还不断地念着生字。她家里的小姑子说：“嫂嫂简直成了‘学习迷’了。”
    阎兆芝参加学习两个多月以来，成绩很好。她不仅已经认得了家中人的名字，还记住了一些有关农业生产和农具等方面的生字。最近民校老师表扬了她，并且鼓励母亲们向她学习。阎兆芝提出了保证，她说：“我一定坚持学习，争取在一九五六年秋后要亲自给丈夫写信，报告社里的丰收喜讯。”
