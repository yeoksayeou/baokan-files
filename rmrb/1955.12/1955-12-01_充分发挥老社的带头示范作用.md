    Give Full Play to the Leading and Exemplary Role of Old Cooperatives
    Luo Zicheng, Zhang Jianda
    After the recent major development of the agricultural cooperation movement in Xinxing Village, Ning'an County, Heilongjiang Province, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has risen from 29 percent of the village's total households to 70 percent, making it a basically cooperative village. One of the reasons why Xinxing Village was able to achieve such significant success in the cooperative movement is that it gave full play to the leading and exemplary role of the old cooperatives in the cooperative movement.
    Summarize the Production Achievements of Old Cooperatives to Inspire the Masses to Join
    Xinxing Village originally had two cooperatives, Red Star and Hexin. These two cooperatives had not summarized their work for a year. Some party members, cadres, and cooperative members doubted whether the cooperatives could increase production and whether the members could increase their income. Some members, seeing that the cooperatives had suffered some disasters, thought, "We've been busy for nothing this year, this is terrible," and their production was not very active. Member Su Huiqing even used getting married as an excuse to take two cows out of the cooperative. Some farmers outside the cooperative also said: the cooperative worked quietly for a year, and no one knows if it's really worth it. Others said: don't listen to the cooperative bragging, you can only see a few good crops under your nose, and it's not necessarily stronger than a mutual aid team. In order to eliminate the doubts of party members, cadres, and cooperative members, the Party branch first helped the old cooperatives hold a members' meeting, systematically explaining the achievements and shortcomings of running the cooperative over the past year. Then the old cooperatives sent out two propaganda teams to publicize the advantages of the cooperative to farmers outside the cooperative. At the same time, in the mutual aid teams, the method of "five comparisons and one evaluation" (comparing production, grain yield, income, public property, and collective strength, and evaluating the shortcomings of the cooperative) was adopted to let the masses understand the advantages of the cooperative and put forward their opinions on the cooperative. After the summary, it can be seen that the Red Star Cooperative produced 1,600 catties of grain per hectare, which is 270 catties more than the best mutual aid team in the village and 410 catties more than the average mutual aid team. Although the Hexin Cooperative suffered some disasters, its yield per hectare also reached 1,520 catties, which is 152 catties more than the best mutual aid team and 320 catties more than the average mutual aid team. The two cooperatives had more than 8,000 yuan in sideline income, built warehouses and stables, added 18 new-style farm implements, and expanded public property. At the same time, they also provided economic and technical assistance to the mutual aid teams. These vivid examples greatly educated the masses and eliminated their doubts. Poor peasant Li Zhongyun said: "This comparison really shows the advantages of the cooperative. My income is less than a third of a cooperative member's income. If I had known these benefits, I would have joined the cooperative long ago." The masses also offered well-intentioned criticisms of the cooperative's messy accounts, thin horses, outdated work evaluation, and undemocratic and disunited management committee. This played a significant role in improving the work of the cooperative. In this situation, the confidence and determination of party members, cadres, and cooperative members to run the cooperative well became stronger, and the enthusiasm of the masses to run the cooperative also gradually increased.
    Old Cooperatives Carry Out Reasonable Distribution, Disclosing Information to Farmers of All Classes Outside the Cooperative
    Although the advantages of the cooperative have been generally recognized by the broad masses of peasants, some people still have different concerns based on their own circumstances. Poor peasants with large families, poor labor, and the old, weak, and disabled think that the cooperative is good, but they are afraid that they will get less because of their poor labor. Upper-middle peasants with stronger economic strength are also worried that their income will not be more than before joining the cooperative. Even the members themselves don't know exactly how much they can get, and they are not sure. In order to dispel these concerns of the peasants, the branch led the two old cooperatives to formulate this year's production and distribution plan, carry out reasonable distribution, and disclose information to farmers of all classes outside the cooperative. The results of the distribution calculated by the two cooperatives showed that the income of members of all classes increased to varying degrees compared to the year before joining the cooperative. The average income of 22 poor peasant households in the two cooperatives increased by 31 percent compared to the year before joining the cooperative. Poor peasant Yin Dejiang, a single household, 69 years old, planted one hectare and one mu of land before joining the cooperative, and could not get enough to eat or wear every year, relying on government relief. This year, after joining the cooperative, his income doubled compared to the year before joining the cooperative. The average income of 22 new and old lower-middle peasant households increased by 27 percent compared to the year before joining the cooperative. The income of the five new and old upper-middle peasant households increased by 13 percent compared to the previous year. The income of members of all classes in the two cooperatives obviously exceeded that of Meng Zhaohai's mutual aid team, which had better economic conditions in the village. For example, member Chen Fengliang is a poor peasant, with one labor, no horse, and one hectare and five mu of land. This year he received 3,951 catties of grain. Li Wancai, a team member with the same conditions as him (with two more mu of land), received 2,430 catties of grain this year, 1,521 catties less than Chen Fengliang. Member Chen Wanlian is a new lower-middle peasant, with one labor, one horse, and two hectares and three mu of land. This year his net income was 4,465 catties of grain. Li Lianqing, a team member similar to him (with four more mu of land), had a net income of 3,220 catties of grain this year, 1,245 catties less than Chen Wanlian. Member Zhang Shihua is an upper-middle peasant, with one labor, two horses, and two hectares of land. This year he received 6,190 catties of grain. Zhang Fengrui, a team member similar to him (with three more hectares of land), received 5,200 catties of grain this year, 990 catties less than Zhang Shihua. After these typical figures introduced their income accounts to the masses of the village, farmers of all classes calculated their own income accounts. Poor peasant Zhang Zhichao, a bachelor with weak labor and poor eyesight, planted two mu of sweet potatoes this year, and half of the seedlings were removed, resulting in a small income. After comparing himself to member Yin Dejiang, he calculated his income after joining the cooperative and said, "This time I understand." He actively signed up to join the cooperative. New lower-middle peasant Xie Yongxin also actively asked to join the cooperative. Upper-middle peasant Yang Lianqing, with two laborers, three horses, one cart, and five hectares of land, was originally afraid of having less income after joining the cooperative. This time, seeing that members with the same conditions as him had increased their income, he felt more confident and expressed his willingness to join the cooperative.
    Solve the Mutual Benefit Problems of the Old Cooperatives and Set an Example for the New Cooperatives
    After the farmers outside the cooperative had a desire to join the cooperative, they were all concerned about the handling of mutual benefit issues; and improper handling of some mutual benefit issues in the old cooperatives also added to the concerns of the masses outside the cooperative about joining. Some old, weak, disabled, and poor peasants were afraid of investing too much and not being able to pay, afraid of being assigned too many compulsory labor days, and getting less dividends. Some single men were afraid that their food problems would not be solved after joining the cooperative. The middle peasants reflected that the old cooperatives were using good horses to carry bad horses, using good land to carry bad land, using new farm tools for free, and using manure fertilizer for free, and that cooperation was not mutually beneficial. In order to adjust the mutual benefit relationship between the two old cooperatives and set an example for the new cooperatives that were about to be established, before distribution, the branch helped the two old cooperatives hold a members' meeting, absorbing mutual aid team leaders to participate, and discussed and handled the mutual benefit issues within the cooperatives based on the "Provisional Measures for Handling Certain Economic Issues in Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations" (draft) of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the specific circumstances of the cooperatives. Originally, the rental rates for good horses in the two old cooperatives were too low, and the rental rates for bad horses were too high. As a result of the adjustment, the rental rates for two good horses were increased, and the rental rates for six horses and six cows were appropriately reduced. The land remuneration in the two cooperatives was originally paid according to the land grade assessed for the payment of public grain, without referring to the actual annual output, and the remuneration was relatively low. After adjustment, the land remuneration was basically reasonable. The bias of using farm tools for free and using manure fertilizer for free was corrected. Other investment issues such as fodder and seeds, and compulsory labor issues were also reasonably adjusted and resolved. Because the two old cooperatives handled the remaining issues and implemented the mutual benefit policy, the poor and middle peasants within the cooperatives were more united, the farmers outside the cooperatives also understood the policy, and they generally reflected that this was fair and reasonable, and that the cooperative was truly mutually beneficial. The mutual aid team leaders also initially learned the specific methods of solving mutual benefit issues. They said: we will follow the example of the old cooperatives to ensure that there are no mistakes.
    Organize Old Cooperative Leaders to Help New Cooperatives Build Their Framework
    After the above series of work, the enthusiasm of the masses to join the cooperatives became higher and higher. Some wanted to build new cooperatives, some wanted to join old cooperatives, some wanted to join well-run cooperatives but did not want to join poorly-run cooperatives, and some middle peasants wanted to be with middle peasants. In order to develop the cooperatives in a planned way, in addition to leading the two old cooperatives to formulate expansion plans based on the village's cooperative plan, the branch also organized twelve management committee members and activists from the two old cooperatives to go deep into each household to conduct individual consultations and organize liaison work. In order to do this work well, three rules were established: 1. Conduct liaison work in a planned way according to the cooperative expansion targets and new cooperative construction targets planned by the Party branch, and do not compete for leaders or members. 2. First, conduct liaison work with poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in the cooperative, and then mobilize the upper-middle peasants. 3. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of voluntariness, repeatedly explain the policy, and patiently conduct education. Poor peasant Zhang Shicai and Liu Zipeng had long wanted to join the Red Star Cooperative, but they were afraid that they would not be able to pay the investment and that the cooperative would not want them, so they did not dare to speak up. Li Jishan, the deputy director of the Red Star Cooperative, then explained the situation to them in response to their ideological concerns, telling them that in addition to doing their best to pay, the state would help with the insufficient part, and the cooperative would also consider allowing them to postpone or exempt them from the investment depending on the situation. They were very happy to join the Red Star Cooperative. The next day, Zhang Shicai pulled more than 2,000 catties of sorghum straw to the cooperative and said, "I will invest as much as I can, and I will never rely on the state or the old members." Poor peasant Sun Xingfa was a cooperative expansion target of the Hexin Cooperative. He had poor eyesight and weak labor, and was worried about not having work to do after joining the cooperative. At this time, the management committee of the Hexin Cooperative had arranged a job for him, telling him to specialize in feeding four sows in the cooperative. He was excited to hear this and said, "The cooperative is really thinking of me." In this way, in less than three days, 33 households were mobilized to join the old cooperatives; at the same time, 49 members were helped to connect with the two new cooperatives, Xinsheng and Mingxing, to establish management committees and democratically elect management committee members, building the framework of the cooperatives.
    Establish a Central Cooperative to Drive the New Cooperatives to Engage in Production
    After the two new cooperatives were built, they urgently needed to establish a normal production order and make preparations for next year's production in a planned way. However, the new cooperative management committees lacked experience in this area, and production was still being carried out in a decentralized manner. In order to solve this problem, the branch led the cooperatives to establish a new mutual aid and cooperation network with the Red Star Cooperative as the central cooperative. At the meeting of the mutual aid and cooperation network, the central cooperative introduced the experience of specifically arranging production in the transition stage from teams to cooperatives, enabling the new cooperative leaders to learn how to manage production. The 28 new members of the Xinsheng Cooperative originally threshed separately. Now the management committee has formed two threshing teams based on the original teams, exchanging labor for threshing, and drawing out four people, eight horses, and two sets of large plows to plow the land, and assigning special personnel to collect high-quality seeds in preparation for sowing. The Mingxing Cooperative also uniformly preserved corn stalks to be used as a substitute feed for livestock. At present, the new cooperatives have begun to shift to production under the leadership of the old cooperatives.

专栏：积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动

    充分发挥老社的带头示范作用
    骆子程　张俭达
    黑龙江省宁安县新兴村经过最近农业合作化运动的大发展，入社农户由原来占全村总户数百分之二十九上升到百分之七十，已经成为基本合作化村了。新兴村在合作化运动中能够取得这样重大的成就，其原因之一，就是充分发挥了老社在合作化运动中的带头示范作用。
    总结老社生产成绩，启发群众入社要求
    新兴村原有红星、合心两个社。这两个社一年来没有总结过工作。有一部分党员干部和社员群众对社能不能增产、社员能不能增加收入有怀疑。有些社员见到社里受了些灾，心想“白忙碌一年了，这回算糟了”，生产不大积极。社员苏惠清甚至以娶媳妇为借口，从社里牵出两条牛。社外一些农民也说：合作社闷着干了一年，连个准底也摸不上。还有的说：别听合作社瞎吹牛，去了眼皮底下几块好庄稼，不见得比互助组强。为了消除党员干部和社员群众的怀疑，党支部首先帮助老社召开了社员大会，系统地说明了一年来办社的成绩和缺点；然后由老社派出两个宣传队，向社外农民宣传合作社的优越性。同时在互助组中，采取“五比一评”（比生产、比打粮、比收入、比公共财产、比集体力量，评社的缺点）的方法，让群众了解合作社的优越性，提出对合作社的意见。经过总结，可以看出：红星社粮食每垧产一千六百斤，比全村最好的互助组每垧地的产量高出二百七十斤，比一般互助组高出四百一十斤。合心社虽然受些灾，每垧产量也达到一千五百二十斤，比最好的互助组高出一百五十二斤，比一般互助组高出三百二十斤。两个社副业收入八千多元。盖了仓库、马棚，新添了十八件新式农具，扩大了公共财产。同时，还从经济上、技术上援助了互助组。这些生动的事例，使群众受到很大教育，消除了疑虑。贫农李忠云说：“这一比合作社优越性真不少啊，我三个也赶不上一个社员收入多，知道有这些好处，我早就入社了。”群众对合作社账乱、马瘦、评工老八分和管理委员会不民主、不团结也提出了善意的批评。这对改进合作社工作起了很大的作用。在这种情况下，党员、干部和社员办好社的信心和决心更加坚强了，群众办社积极性也逐渐高涨起来。
    老社进行合理分配，向社外各阶层农民交底
    虽然合作社的优越性已经被广大农民所公认，但是，有些人根据自身的处境，也还有不同的顾虑。人口多、劳力差、以及老弱残疾的贫农，认为合作社好是好，可是自己劳力差，怕分得少。经济力量较强的上中农，也担心收入不能比入社前多。就是社员也不知道自己究竟能分多少，心里没有底。支部为了解除农民这些顾虑，领导两个老社制定了今年生产分配方案，进行合理分配，向社外各阶层农民交底。两个社计算分配的结果是：各阶层社员都比入社前一年程度不同地增加了收入。两社贫农二十二户，比入社前一年平均增加收入百分之三十一。贫农尹德江，是个独身户，六十九岁，参加社以前，种一垧一亩地，年年吃不饱，穿不暖，靠政府救济；今年入了社，收入比入社前一年增加一倍。新老下中农二十二户，比入社前一年平均增加收入百分之二十七。五户新、老上中农，比入社前增加收入百分之十三。两个社各阶层社员的收入，显然超过本村经济条件较好的孟照海互助组。如社员陈凤良是个贫农，一个劳力、没有马、一垧五亩地，今年分得三千九百五十一斤粮，和他条件相同的组员李万才（地多二亩），今年收入二千四百三十斤粮，比陈凤良少收一千五百二十一斤粮食。社员陈万连，是新下中农，一个劳力，一匹马，二垧三亩地，今年纯收入四千四百六十五斤粮，和他相仿的组员李连庆（地多四亩），今年净收入三千二百二十斤粮，比陈万连少收一千二百四十五斤粮食。社员张世华，是个上中农、一个劳力，两匹马，两垧地，今年分得六千一百九十斤粮，和他相仿的组员张凤瑞（地多三垧）今年收入五千二百斤粮；比张世华少收九百九十斤粮食。这些典型人物把自己的收入账向全村群众介绍以后，各阶层农民纷纷算开了自己的收入账。贫农张志超，是个单身汉，劳力弱，眼色不好，今年种两亩甘薯，铲掉了一半苗，收入不多。他对照社员尹德江算了自己入社后的收入账说：“这回心里亮堂了。”他积极报名入社。新下中农谢永信，也积极要求参加合作社。上中农杨连清，两个劳力，三匹马，一台车，五垧地，原怕入社收入少，这次见到和他条件相同的社员增加了收入，心里也有底了，表示愿意参加合作社。
    解决老社的互利问题，给新社作出榜样
    社外农民有了入社要求以后，都在关心互利问题的处理；而老社某些互利问题处理不当，也给社外群众增添了入社顾虑。部分老弱残疾的贫困农民，怕投资多缴不起，怕义务工摊得多，分红少。有些单身汉怕入了社吃饭问题不好解决。中农反映：老社是好马背次马，好地背次地，新农具白使，粪肥白用，合作不讲两利。为了调整两个老社的互利关系，并且给即将建立的新社作出榜样，在分配前，支部帮助两个老社召开了社员大会，吸收互助组骨干参加，根据中共黑龙江省委关于农业生产互助合作组织中若干经济问题的处理暂行办法（草稿）和本社具体情况，讨论和处理了社内的互利问题。原来两个老社好马租额偏低，次马租额偏高。调整结果，提高了两匹好马租额，适当降低六匹马和六条牛租额。两个社的土地报酬原按出公粮所评的地级付酬，没有参照常年实际产量来评定，报酬较低。经过调整，土地报酬做到了基本上合理。对农具白使、粪肥白用的偏向作了纠正。其他草料、籽种等投资问题和义务工问题也作了合理的调整和解决。由于两个老社处理了遗留问题，贯彻执行了互利政策，社内贫中农更加团结了，社外农民对政策也摸底了，普遍反映：这么办真是公平合理，合作社真讲两利。互助组骨干也初步学会了解决互利问题的具体办法，他们说：咱们就照老社办事，保证没有错。
    组织老社骨干帮助新社搭架子
    经过以上一系列的工作，群众加入合作社的积极性越来越高。有的愿意建新社，有的愿意入老社，有人愿意入办得好的社、不愿意入办得差的社，有的中农愿意和中农在一起。为了有计划地发展合作社，支部除领导两个老社根据本村关于合作化的规划制定扩社计划外，并且组织了两个老社的十二名管理委员和社员积极分子，分工深入各户进行个别酝酿和组织串连工作。为了把这件工作做好，订出了三条纪律：一、根据党支部规划的扩社对象和建社对象有计划地进行串连，不许争骨干，争社员。二、首先串连贫农和下中农参加合作社，然后发动上中农。三、必须坚持自愿原则，反复交代政策，耐心进行教育。贫农张世才和刘子鹏早有心参加红星社，但是怕缴不起投资，社不要，不敢开口。红星社副主任李季山便针对这种思想顾虑向他们交了底，告诉他们除了个人尽力缴纳外，不足部分国家会帮助，社里也会根据情况酌情让他们缓投或免投。他两人听了非常愉快地参加了红星社。第二天张世才就把二千多斤谷草拉到社里，并且说：“我有多少投多少，绝不依赖国家和老社员。”贫农孙兴发是合心社扩社对象，眼色不好，劳力弱，正在忧虑入社后没活干，这时合心社管理委员已给他安排了活计，告诉他到社里专门喂四口母猪，他听了兴奋地说：“合作社真是给我想得周到。”这样作，不到三天功夫，便发动了三十三户参加老社；同时，帮助新生、明星两个新社串连好了四十九户社员，成立了管理委员会，民主选举了管理委员，搭好了社架子。
    建立中心社，带动新社搞生产
    两个新社建成后，迫切需要建立正常的生产秩序，有计划地作好明年生产准备工作。但是新社管理委员会缺乏这方面的经验，生产仍在分散进行。为了解决这个问题，支部领导各社以红星社为中心社，建立了新的互助合作网。中心社在互助合作网的会议上，向新社介绍了由组转社这个新旧交替阶段具体安排生产的经验，使新社骨干学会了管理生产方法。新生社二十八户新社员原来都是分散打场，现在管理委员会以原组为基础，组成两个打场组，换工打场，从中抽出四个人、八匹马、套两付大犁耠地，并且责成专人收集优良籽种，准备下种。明星社还把玉米秸统一保存起来，留作耕畜代用饲料。目前新社已经在老社带动下转入生产。
