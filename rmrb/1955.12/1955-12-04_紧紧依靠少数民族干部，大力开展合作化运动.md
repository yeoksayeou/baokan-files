    Rely Closely on Minority Cadres, Vigorously Develop the Cooperative Movement
    By Liu Gang, Secretary of the CPC Shufu County Committee, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region

    Shufu County began experimenting with establishing agricultural production cooperatives in the spring of 1954. By the spring of 1955, 125 cooperatives had been established in 48% of the county's townships, with 3,849 farmer households participating, accounting for 6.5% of the county's total farmer households. The plan is to build another 348 cooperatives by the end of January 1956. Adding the existing old cooperatives, the county will have 473 cooperatives, and the participating farmer households will account for about 24% of the county's total farmer households.

    The existing 125 old cooperatives have all been consolidated. These cooperatives have annual, quarterly, and monthly production plans and organize labor and arrange farm work according to these plans. Many cooperatives have technically trained personnel, and some have established technical guidance groups. Cooperatives throughout the county widely use new-style walking plows and have adopted farming methods such as row sowing, spot sowing, inter-tillage, weeding, plowing, harrowing, and cotton pruning. They have also selected and promoted various improved crop varieties. This year, wheat throughout the county generally suffered from natural disasters, but according to statistics from 61 agricultural cooperatives in seven districts, the average yield per mu of 73,493 mu of wheat still reached 284.3 jin. The wheat from the Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in the fifth township of Tokzak district yielded an average of 384 jin per mu, exceeding the highest yield of local mutual aid teams by 50 jin and exceeding the general yield of local individual farmers by 120 jin. Judging from the autumn harvest this year, most cooperative members can increase their income compared to last year, except for a few households. After the preliminary distribution of the summer harvest, inspections were carried out in various places based on the standards of good production, good unity, good system, and good leading cadres. The better cooperatives accounted for 40.8%, the average cooperatives accounted for 47.2%, and the poorer cooperatives accounted for 12%. Due to the influence of the cooperatives, mutual aid teams and individual farmers, especially the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants, who account for 73% of the county's total farmer households, are increasingly eager to establish cooperatives. Last winter and this spring, there were instances of entire villages jointly applying to establish cooperatives. After the summer harvest this year, there has been a phenomenon of automatic merging of groups, unified sowing of winter wheat, collective accumulation of fertilizer, purchase of livestock, farm tools, and accumulation of public property in various villages. In particular, after the publication of Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party's "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," more and more farmers are applying to join the cooperatives.

    Ethnic relations in the countryside of Shufu County are relatively complex. In leading the agricultural cooperative movement, this must be taken into account; but it must not be concluded that the cooperative movement cannot develop rapidly in Shufu County. We believe that Shufu County is fully capable of building more and better agricultural cooperatives on the existing foundation. First, thanks to the correct implementation of the Party's ethnic policies in recent years, the farmers of all ethnic groups have been united as never before. It is already very common for farmers of all ethnic groups to help each other, unite, and develop production in jointly organized mutual aid teams and cooperatives. Second, this area is more backward and poorer than the Han areas of inland China, the farming techniques are very crude, and the production potential is very large. It is extremely easy to show the superiority of organizing agricultural cooperatives, so the vast majority of farmers, especially the poor farmers, are extremely eager to get rid of poverty and backwardness, and their enthusiasm for taking the road of cooperation is very high. Third, we have also seen that a large number of local ethnic cadres have grown up after several years of training. Among the Party and government cadres below the district level in Shufu County, except for a very few Han cadres from other places, all are local ethnic cadres. Most of the county-level cadres are also local ethnic cadres. Half of the county-level cadres, more than 90% of the district-level cadres, and all township cadres in cooperative townships have experience in building and running cooperatives. One-third of the township cadres in townships that have not yet established cooperatives have also participated in the work of building and running cooperatives and have gained certain experience. Fourth, among the 102 townships in the county, 68 have established Party branches and 93 have established Communist Youth League branches, with a total of 817 Party members and 2,028 League members. We plan to have a Party branch in every township before next spring's plowing. Most of the existing rural Party branches can undertake the task of independently leading the establishment and running of cooperatives. Fifth, Xinjiang is close to the Soviet Union, and the vast majority of farmers are extremely envious of the happy lives of Soviet farmers who have taken the road of collectivization. At the same time, the superiority shown by the collective labor of the agricultural production units of the Xinjiang Military Region has also given great encouragement to the vast majority of farmers.

    In carrying out the agricultural cooperative movement in minority areas, it is necessary to boldly use and rely on local ethnic cadres, so that they can continue to be trained and improved in practical work; and continue to promote a large number of local ethnic cadres in the movement. This is one of the most important keys to whether the cooperative movement in Shufu County can develop successfully and healthily in the future. To do this work well, it is necessary to continue to educate Han cadres from other places, so that they can overcome and prevent the remnants of Han chauvinism and the work style of taking over everything. The leading organs must patiently help local ethnic cadres to achieve results in their work and build up their confidence; when assigning tasks to local ethnic cadres, it is necessary to clearly explain the policies and specific working methods; in the course of the work, it is necessary to correctly treat the shortcomings and mistakes of ethnic cadres, strengthen persuasion and education, and not to criticize them rudely, so as not to hurt their enthusiasm and creativity. In the past, some places were not bold enough in using local ethnic grassroots cadres, always wanting to wait for higher authorities to send cadres to help with the work. Facts have proved that with the development of the cooperative movement, a large number of activists have emerged from the masses, which is the most important and solid source of cadres. The biggest characteristics of local ethnic cadres and activists are: they not only have extensive and close ties with the masses, can timely grasp the real ideological situation of the masses, but also have a strong desire to make progress and are quick to accept new things. As long as we patiently train them and boldly use and rely on them to work, their policy level and working ability will be improved quickly. This year, the county Party committee assigned the task of building cooperatives to Seman District. Initially, the district Party committee believed that the cadre force was not enough and expected the higher authorities to send cadres to help; later, according to the requirements of the county Party committee, it boldly used rural cadres and activists and successfully built 29 cooperatives in half a month, and the quality of these cooperatives was very good. The Party branch in the fourth township of Seman District was only established for one year, and only the Party branch secretary had participated in the work of building cooperatives in the past. This time, the township branch led all rural cadres, eight Party members, 15 League members, and activists, and in half a month, they not only completed the task of establishing five cooperatives stipulated by the district Party committee, but also built one more cooperative.

    Carrying out the agricultural cooperative movement is a fierce and complex class struggle. In this mass movement, counter-revolutionary elements and class dissidents will inevitably carry out various sabotage and obstruction. Therefore, all cadres and the broad masses of peasants should be educated to raise their vigilance and wage a resolute struggle against all counter-revolutionary activities. At the same time, we must earnestly do a good job in the united front work, strive to unite all those who can be united, and make them support and sympathize with the great cause of socialist transformation of agriculture.

    紧紧依靠少数民族干部，大力开展合作化运动
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区疏附县委书记  刘岗
    疏附县自一九五四年春季开始试建农业生产合作社，到一九五五年春季，已经在全县百分之四十八的乡中建立了一百二十五个社，入社农民三千八百四十九户，占全县总农户的百分之六点五。计划在一九五六年一月底以前再建成三百四十八个合作社，加上原有老社，全县将有四百七十三个社，入社农户将占到全县总农户的百分之二十四左右。
    现有的一百二十五个老社已经全部巩固下来。这些合作社都有了年度、季度、月度的生产计划，按计划组织劳动力和安排农活。许多合作社都有经过训练培养的技术员，有些合作社成立了技术指导小组。全县合作社普遍地使用了新式步犁，采用了条播、点播、中耕、拔草、翻地、耙地、棉花整枝等耕作方法，并且选用和推广了各种作物优良品种。今年全县的小麦较普遍地受到了自然灾害，但是据七个区六十一个农业合作社的统计，七万三千四百九十三亩小麦每亩平均产量仍达二百八十四点三斤。托克札克区五乡幸福农业生产合作社的小麦，平均每亩产三百八十四斤，超过当地互助组的最高产量五十斤，超过当地单干农民一般产量一百二十斤。从今年秋收的情况看，除个别户外，绝大部分社员都可以比去年增加收入。夏收预分后，各地按照生产好、团结好、制度好、领导骨干好的标准检查，较好的社占百分之四十点八，一般社占百分之四十七点二，较差的社占百分之十二。由于合作社的影响，互助组和单干农民，特别是占全县总农户百分之七十三的贫农和新老中农中的下中农，建社的要求日益迫切。去冬今春就出现了全村农民联名申请建社的事例。今年夏收后，自动并组，统一播种冬麦，集体积肥，购置耕畜，农具，积累公共财产的现象，各个乡村都有。特别是毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会“关于农业合作化问题的决议”公布后，申请入社的农民更是越来越多。
    疏附县农村中的民族关系比较复杂，领导农业合作化运动，必须注意到这一点；但是决不能因此就认为合作化运动在疏附县不可能迅速发展。我们认为疏附县完全有条件在现有基础上把农业合作社办得更多些和更好些。第一、由于几年来正确地贯彻执行了党的民族政策，各民族的农民已经空前团结，各族农民在共同组织的互助组、合作社中互相帮助，团结一致，发展生产的事例，已经很普遍。第二、这个地区较关内汉族地区落后、贫困，耕作技术非常粗放，生产潜力很大，组织起农业合作社极容易显示优越性，所以广大农民尤其是贫困农民要求摆脱贫困、落后状况的愿望异常迫切，走合作化道路的热情是很高的。第三、我们还看到，本地民族干部经过几年来的培养锻炼，已经大批成长起来了。疏附县区级以下的党政干部中，除有极个别的外来汉族干部外，全是本地民族干部。县级的干部也大部分是本地民族干部。全县有二分之一的县级干部、百分之九十以上的区级干部和建社乡的全部乡干部都有了建社、办社经验。未建社的乡也有三分之一的乡干部参加过建社、办社工作，有了一定的建社、办社经验。第四、全县一百零二个乡中，已有六十八个乡建立了党支部、九十三个乡建立了团支部，共有党员八百一十七名，团员二千零二十八名。我们计划在明年春耕生产前达到乡乡有党支部。现有农村党支部多数可以担负起单独领导建社、办社的任务了。第五、新疆靠近苏联，广大农民对于苏联农民走集体化道路所得到的幸福生活极其向往。同时，新疆军区农业生产部队集体劳动所显示出的优越性，也给了广大农民极大的鼓舞。
    在少数民族地区开展农业合作化运动，必须大胆放手使用和依靠本地民族干部，使他们在实际工作中继续得到锻炼和提高；并且在运动中继续大量地提拔本地民族干部。这是今后疏附县合作化运动能否胜利地健康地发展的重要关键之一。要作好这一工作，就必须继续教育外来汉族干部，使他们克服和防止大民族主义思想残余和包办代替的作风。领导机关必须耐心地帮助本地民族干部在工作中作出成绩来，树立他们的工作信心；在给本地民族干部布置任务的时候，必须交代清政策和具体工作方法；在工作进程中要正确地对待民族干部的缺点和错误，加强说服教育，不要粗暴地加以斥责，以免伤害他们的积极性、创造性。过去有些地方在使用本地民族的基层干部上仍不够大胆放手，总想等待上级派干部来帮助工作。事实证明，随着合作化运动的发展，群众中的积极分子已经大批地涌现出来了，这是干部的最重要最雄厚的泉源。本地民族干部和积极分子最大的特点是：他们不仅同群众有广泛密切的联系，能够及时掌握群众的真实思想情况，而且上进心极强，接受新鲜事物快。只要我们耐心地培养他们，大胆放手地使用和依靠他们去工作，他们的政策水平和工作能力很快就会提高。今年县委给色满区布置建社任务，最初区委认为干部力量不够，期待上级派干部去援助；以后根据县委的要求，大胆放手使用乡村干部和积极分子，半个月中就胜利地建成二十九个社，而且这些社的质量都很好。色满区四乡党支部才建立一年，只有党支部书记一人过去参加过建社工作。这次这个乡支部领导全体乡村干部、八名党员、十五名团员和积极分子，用半个月的时间，不但完成了区委规定的建立五个社的任务，而且还多建了一个社。
    开展农业合作化运动，是一场激烈的复杂的阶级斗争，在这个群众运动中，反革命分子和阶级异己分子必然会进行各种破坏和阻挠。因此应该教育全体干部和广大农民群众提高警惕，同一切反革命活动进行坚决的斗争。同时还要切实作好统一战线工作，争取团结一切可能争取团结的人，使他们赞助和同情农业社会主义改造的伟大事业。
