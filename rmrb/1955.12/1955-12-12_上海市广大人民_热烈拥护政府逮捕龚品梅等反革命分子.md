The broad masses of the people of Shanghai are enthusiastically denouncing the crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group and warmly supporting the government's correct measures in arresting counter-revolutionary elements like Gong Pinmei.

After the public security organs arrested Gong Pinmei and other counter-revolutionary elements, the Shanghai Municipal and District Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference convened enlarged meetings one after another. Leaders of the Shanghai municipal organizations of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and representatives from all walks of life who attended the meetings expressed their immense anger at the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group's collusion with imperialism, their engagement in espionage activities under the guise of religion, their poisoning of young people, and their persecution of patriotic Catholics. They unanimously supported the government's arrest of these counter-revolutionary elements hidden within the Catholic Church.

In the three weeks following the publication of the news about the cracking of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group, the Shanghai "Liberation Daily" received a total of 1,422 letters from people of all walks of life angrily denouncing and exposing the crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group. Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Chinese Christian Church, Bishop Chen Jianzhen, Chairman of the Episcopal Church of China, Zhao Puchu, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China, Master Chi Song, Vice President of the Shanghai Buddhist Association, and Ma Renbin, Imam of the Mosque, all wrote articles in newspapers supporting the government's correct measures. Chen Jianzhen said, "The government's arrest of the gang of counter-revolutionary elements headed by Gong Pinmei according to law is not only eliminating harm for the people but also eliminating harm for the Church. This is a great joyous event for the entire religious community."

Many people, in their speeches at gatherings and in letters to the newspaper, also angrily denounced the crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group. Sun Lanfang, Mo Shuxian, and others, residents of Peide Lane on Datong Road, were witnesses to the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group's openly committing violence and privately torturing the patriotic Catholic Gu Pingsheng in the Catholic Church. They said that when they went to rescue Gu Pingsheng upon hearing the commotion, these counter-revolutionary elements even insulted and beat them, shouting counter-revolutionary slogans wildly. All the lane cadres of Peide Lane requested the People's Government to severely punish counter-revolutionary elements such as Gong Pinmei. 1,162 lane cadres and women cadres in Luwan District also wrote to the government requesting severe punishment for these extremely wicked counter-revolutionary elements.

Teachers, childcare workers, medical workers, and many parents from major, middle, and primary schools in Shanghai expressed particular indignation at the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group's crimes of poisoning young children.

    上海市广大人民
    热烈拥护政府逮捕龚品梅等反革命分子
    上海市广大人民纷纷声讨龚品梅反革命集团的罪行，热烈拥护政府逮捕龚品梅等反革命分子的正确措施。
    中国人民政治协商会议上海市和各区委员会在公安机关逮捕了龚品梅等反革命分子以后，纷纷召开扩大会议。参加会的上海市各民主党派地方组织和各人民团体的负责人以及各界人士在发言中，对龚品梅反革命集团勾结帝国主义、披着宗教外衣进行间谍情报活动和毒害青年、迫害爱国天主教徒等种种罪行，表示无比愤怒，一致拥护政府逮捕这些暗藏在天主教内的反革命分子。
    上海“解放日报”在登载破获龚品梅反革命集团消息后的三个多星期里，收到各界人民愤怒声讨和检举龚品梅反革命集团罪行的信件一共有一千四百二十二封。中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会主席吴耀宗、中华圣公会主教院主席主教陈见真，中国佛教协会副会长赵朴初、上海市佛教协会副会长持松法师，以及清真寺伊斯兰教教长马人斌等都在报纸上写文章拥护政府的正确措施。陈见真说：“政府将以龚品梅为首的一伙反革命分子依法逮捕，不仅是为民除害，也是为教除害，这是整个宗教界的一件大喜事。”
    很多群众在集会上的发言中和写给报社的信中，也都愤怒斥责龚品梅反革命集团的罪行。大通路培德里的居民孙兰芳、莫淑娴等是目睹龚品梅反革命集团在天主堂里公然行凶、私刑拷打爱国教徒顾平生的见证人。她们说，当她们闻声前去救顾平生时，这些反革命分子还殴辱她们，猖狂地呼喊反革命口号。培德里全体里弄干部请求人民政府一定要严惩龚品梅等反革命分子。卢湾区一千一百六十二名里弄干部和妇女干部也写信给政府要求对这些罪大恶极的反革命分子予以严厉惩处。
    上海各大、中、小学的教师、保育工作者、医务工作者和许多家长，对龚品梅反革命集团毒害青年儿童的罪行特别感到愤慨。
