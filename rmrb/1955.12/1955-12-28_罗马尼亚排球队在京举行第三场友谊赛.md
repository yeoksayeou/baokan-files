    Romanian Volleyball Team Holds Third Friendly Match in Beijing

    The Romanian national men's volleyball team's third friendly match in China was held on the evening of the 26th at the competition hall of the Beijing Gymnasium. The Chinese side fielded the champion team of the 1955 National Volleyball League—the Northeast Institute of Physical Education men's volleyball team.

    Ni. Sotir, an international referee from the Romanian national men's volleyball team, served as the referee for this friendly match. During the match, Ni. Sotir's accurate judgment and clear gestures were praised by the audience.

    In the match on the 26th, the Romanian team once again demonstrated their superb volleyball skills. Utilizing their height advantage, they often jumped up and quickly spiked the ball over the net when it was very high or far from the net. They also frequently used powerful hook serves, increasing the difficulty for the opponent to receive the ball and preventing them from smoothly organizing attacks. In the match on the 26th, the Northeast Institute of Physical Education team lost three consecutive games with scores of 5-15, 8-15, and 4-15 due to inaccurate and weak spikes, as well as untimely and inadequate defense.

    罗马尼亚排球队在京举行第三场友谊赛
    罗马尼亚国家男子排球队在中国的第三场友谊赛，二十六日晚上在北京体育馆的比赛馆中举行。中国方面出场的是一九五五年全国排球联赛的冠军队——东北体育学院男子排球队。
    罗马尼亚国家男子排球队中的国际裁判尼·索蒂尔担任了这场友谊赛的裁判。在比赛过程中，尼·索蒂尔准确的判断和明确的手式，受到观众的称赞。
    罗马尼亚队在二十六日的比赛中，再一次表现了他们的高超的排球技术。他们利用身体高的优点，经常在球离网很高或者很远的地方，跳起来把它迅速地扣过网去。他们还经常用有力的钩手发球，增加了对方接球的困难，使对方不能顺利地组织进攻。东北体育学院队在二十六日的比赛中，因为扣球不够准确和有力，防守也不够及时和严密，所以以五比十五、八比十五和四比十五连败三局。
