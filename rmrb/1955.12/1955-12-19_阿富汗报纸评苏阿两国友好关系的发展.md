Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, 16th (TASS) – Kabul newspapers published many articles commenting on the visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to Afghanistan.

　　"Islah" wrote that the friendly ties between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have a long history. Thirty-seven years ago, Afghanistan achieved political independence after a selfless struggle, and the Soviet Union was the first country in the world to officially recognize our independence. Since then, the political and friendly ties between the two countries have become more consolidated. For each other's happiness and prosperity, the two countries are firmly committed to consolidating international peace. Now, as Soviet leaders come to Afghanistan, we are convinced that their visit will further expand and consolidate the existing friendly relations between the two countries.

　　The newspaper said: The Soviet Union has always provided Afghanistan with valuable assistance to meet its economic needs and other urgent requirements. Without the help of major powers and international organizations, Afghanistan cannot effectively develop its own economy. In this regard, the Soviet Union's assistance is a model of sincerity and friendly relations.

　　"Anis" wrote that Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have mutual understanding and mutual respect on all issues. Based on the principles of cooperation and mutual benefit, the two countries constantly resolve difficulties of all sizes and various border and economic issues. If any obstacles arise, they can be quickly eliminated. In particular, recently, as a result of the exchange of delegations, scientific and cultural figures, and the Soviet Union's technical assistance to Afghanistan, the friendship between the two countries has been further consolidated and developed.

　　All Kabul newspapers published pictures and biographies of Bulganin and Khrushchev.

    阿富汗报纸评苏阿两国友好关系的发展
    新华社据塔斯社喀布尔十六日讯　喀布尔报纸发表了许多文章，评论布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问阿富汗。
      “革新报”写道，阿富汗和苏联两国的友好联系有着久远的历史。三十七年前，阿富汗经过奋不顾身的斗争而取得政治独立，苏联是世界各国中第一个正式承认我国独立的。从这时起，两国之间的政治和友好联系更加巩固了。两国为彼此的幸福和繁荣，坚定地致力于巩固国际和平。现在当苏联领导者们来到阿富汗的时候，我们确信：他们的访问将更加扩大和巩固两国之间现存的友好关系。
    这家报纸说：苏联一向给予阿富汗珍贵的援助，以满足它的经济需要和其他迫切的要求。阿富汗没有大国和国际组织的帮助，是不能有效地发展自己的经济的。在这方面，苏联的帮助是真诚和友好关系的典范。
    “友谊报”写道，阿富汗和苏联在所有问题上都是互相谅解和互相尊重的。两国本着合作和互利的原则，经常不断地解决大大小小的困难以及各种边境和经济的问题，如果发生了任何障碍，也能很快地消除。特别是最近由于互派代表团、科学和文化界人士以及苏联给予阿富汗技术帮助的结果，两国之间的友谊更为巩固和发展了。
    喀布尔所有的报纸都刊登了布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的像片和传记。
