Xinhua News Agency, December 10th. Premier Grotewohl, his wife, and some members of the German Democratic Republic government delegation visited Tsinghua University on the afternoon of the 10th. Accompanying them was Ji Pengfei, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China.

As Premier Grotewohl and others arrived at Tsinghua University, professors, lecturers, and students who had been waiting for a long time in front of the school building jumped, cheered, and applauded thunderously for a long time.

Jiang Nanxiang, President of Tsinghua University, extended a warm welcome to the distinguished guests on behalf of all the teachers and students and introduced the university's situation. Then, accompanied by their hosts, the distinguished guests began to visit this university, which specializes in training industrial construction talents and has more than 6,700 students. On the tree-lined roads, at the foot of the hills, by the small bridges, and at the classroom doors, Premier Grotewohl and others were welcomed by students lining the streets. He frequently waved to the cheering students, sometimes stopping to talk to them, constantly shouting "Friendship" in Chinese.

After visiting the hydraulic laboratory, Premier Grotewohl encouraged a group of students studying hydraulic engineering, saying: This is a very important job. China has many rivers. I hope you study hard and develop them in the future to make the great China even richer. One student replied: We will definitely remember the Premier's encouragement and study hard. We will build hydropower stations on our Yellow River as large as the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydropower stations.

In the architecture department, the guests carefully watched the drawings of office buildings, theaters, and seaside guest houses designed by the students themselves. Premier Grotewohl praised Chinese architectural art.

When the distinguished guests visited the tolerance and technical measurement room of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the director of the room happily told the distinguished guests: "In our room, the German Democratic Republic has provided the greatest help to us. More than 50 percent of the instruments used are from the German Democratic Republic; out of the 32 main pieces of equipment, 21 were manufactured in the German Democratic Republic." Premier Grotewohl said that the great Chinese people would soon be able to manufacture them themselves. He added: "We are very happy that we can help you with these instruments because this is the work of our mutual friendship."

After the visit, Premier Grotewohl addressed all the teachers and students of the university. When the news was broadcast by loudspeaker, teachers and students poured in like a tide from all directions towards the square, and many people rode bicycles to get there. Before long, several thousand people had gathered in the square. In his speech, Premier Grotewohl said that it was a great pleasure to have the opportunity to spend time with the teachers and students of Tsinghua University. He said that our students, like you, are actively studying for the construction of their own country. The youth of a country are the future of a country. If the youth study well, the country can be built well.

Premier Grotewohl said: The future of China, Germany, and all the people of the world is to build socialism and liberate mankind from exploitation. We assure you that the friendship between us and the great Chinese people is inseparable, permanent, and strong.

Premier Grotewohl ended his speech by shouting "Friendship" in Chinese.

During Premier Grotewohl's speech, long applause and cheers constantly rang out in the square.

This morning, Premier Grotewohl and his wife visited the Beijing Department Store and Rongbaozhai, which is famous for making woodblock prints. Some members of the delegation visited the Central Institute for Nationalities. In the afternoon, Dr. Teplitz, State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice of the German Democratic Republic, a member of the delegation, called on Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and He Chengxiang, Director of the Bureau of Religious Affairs.
