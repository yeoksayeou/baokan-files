Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau's Sun Jingyang Drilling Rig
Is Already Doing Work Scheduled for April Next Year

Editor:
The Sun Jingyang drilling rig of Team 132 of the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau comprehensively overfulfilled its annual production task on September 26. The drilling quality exceeded the national standards, and there were no accidents of any kind throughout the year. Starting in November, this drilling rig has been working on the tasks scheduled for April of next year.

The unity and mutual assistance of the 22 people working on this drilling rig, under the leadership and education of the Party and Youth League organizations, is the key to ensuring the overfulfillment of the task. For example, after the task for July was assigned, it was raining heavily, and the trucks moving the drilling rig could not move. If they waited, the task could not be completed. Therefore, the rig leader, Sun Jingyang (a Party member and secretary of the Youth League branch), convened a Youth League branch meeting to study and mobilize everyone to carry the equipment to the new drilling site in the rain. This not only ensured timely drilling and early completion of the task but also saved 200 yuan in transportation costs.

Timely summarizing and sharing experience is also one of the important reasons for their overfulfillment of the task. In early March, Sun Jingyang led the day shift, and the drilling speed was particularly high. They summarized at the shift meeting that the trick was to probe the bottom of the well more when using "sand." If the sand exceeded half a meter, they would immediately salvage it and replace the "sand" and "drill bit." They introduced this method at the Saturday technical exchange meeting. After other shifts learned it, their work efficiency also caught up with them, thus creating the team's highest record for the first quarter. In July, the Sun Yuwen team found a way to tighten the "drilling tools," and diligently flush and change the sand, drilling two or three meters more than other shifts. After the summary of the shift meetings and the introduction of the technical exchange meetings, the three shifts drilled more than 20 meters a day, so that the drilling rig completed the production tasks about ten days ahead of schedule in August and September.

They also attach great importance to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In May, in well No. 6 in a certain area, the hole collapsed, and the cracks leaked water. According to the instructions of the leaders, the rig leader Sun Jingyang mobilized everyone to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. At first, they used two methods, "yellow mud slurry" and "coal alkali agent mud slurry," which did not work, and some people were discouraged. The Youth League branch asked the technicians to explain the role and operation method of "coal alkali agent mud slurry," and flexibly used the Soviet advanced experience of using "alloy drill bits" and "iron sand" for drilling according to the changes in the rock formation in the hole, and finally solved the difficulties and comprehensively completed the production plan.

They also attach great importance to conservation in their work. This year alone, they saved more than 900 yuan just by reducing the number of pliers they received, and saved more than 20 kilograms of rags for wiping machines. This drilling rig saved a total of 36,980 yuan from January to the end of September, reducing the cost by more than 35%.

### 西北煤田地质勘探局孙景阳钻机  已经在做明年四月份的工作

    西北煤田地质勘探局孙景阳钻机
    已经在做明年四月份的工作编辑同志：
    西北煤田地质勘探局一三二队的孙景阳钻机在九月二十六日已经全面超额完成了今年的生产任务，钻探质量超过了国家指标，全年没有出过任何责任事故。从十一月份开始，这台钻机正在干着明年四月份的工作。
    在这台钻机上工作的二十二人，在党、团组织的领导和教育下团结互助，是保证超额完成任务的关键。如七月份的任务下达后，天正下大雨，搬移钻机的汽车不能行动。等下去，任务就无法完成。于是机长孙景阳（党员，团支部书记）召集团支部会议研究，发动大家冒雨把东西抬向新的钻孔边去。这样，不但保证了及时开钻和提前完成任务；而且还节约了二百元的运费。
    及时总结和交流经验，也是他们超额完成任务的重要原因之一。三月初，孙景阳带领白班工作，进尺速度特别高，他们在班后会上总结，窍门是：用“砂子”的时候要多探井底，如果砂子超过了半公尺，马上进行打捞，重换“砂子”和“钻头”。他们就把这种方法在星期六的技术交流会上介绍了，别的班学习以后工作效率也赶上了他们，因此创造了全队第一季度的最高纪录。七月份孙玉文班找到了抓紧上下“钻具”，勤冲、勤换砂的办法，比别的班多钻了二、三公尺。经过班后会的总结和技术交流会的介绍，三班一天打到了二十多公尺，使钻机在八、九月份都提前十天左右全面完成了生产任务。
    他们对学习苏联先进经验的工作也很重视。五月间，他们在某区六号钻孔，孔内坍塌掉块，裂缝漏水。机长孙景阳根据领导指示，发动大家学习苏联先进经验。开始时，使用了“黄泥浆”和“煤碱剂泥浆”两项办法，不顶事，有人就泄气了。团支部就请技术员讲解“煤碱剂泥浆”的作用和操作方法，又根据孔内岩层变化灵活使用“合金钻头”和“铁砂”钻进的苏联先进经验，终于解决了困难，全面完成了生产计划。
    他们在工作中还很重视节约。今年一年，光少领的钳子就节约了九百多元，擦机器的破布共节省了二十多公斤。这个钻机从一月到九月底共节约了三万六千九百八十多元，使成本降低了百分之三十五以上。
