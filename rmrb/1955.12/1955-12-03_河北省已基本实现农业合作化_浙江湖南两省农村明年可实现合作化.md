Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, December 2nd: Hebei Province has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. By the end of November, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has reached 70% of the total number of peasant households in the province, and in 21 counties, the number of households joining cooperatives has reached more than 80%. This winter and next spring, on the basis of the existing 113 advanced cooperatives, more than 400 advanced cooperatives will be converted from the old cooperatives with a better foundation throughout the province.

Since the beginning of November, after the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all localities to make every effort to rectify and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives, a rectification movement centered on the disposal of means of production joining the cooperatives and the development of winter production has been fully launched in various places. At present, among the more than 62,000 agricultural production cooperatives newly established in the province, more than 46,000 have completed or basically completed the evaluation of the means of production joining the cooperatives and the formulation of cooperative charters, and have elected leading cadres with poor and lower-middle peasants as the core. The more than 64,000 cooperatives that have been expanded and merged on the basis of the original 97,000 old cooperatives, in addition to actively dealing with some problems after expansion and merger, have also summarized the successful experiences of past production increases and inspected the problems existing in management in the autumn harvest distribution.

At present, most agricultural production cooperatives have formulated production plans for this winter and next spring to welcome a new upsurge in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 2nd: The number of peasant households in Zhejiang Province who have joined agricultural production cooperatives has exceeded half of the total number of peasant households in the province.

As of the end of November, 54,454 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the province, plus the original cooperatives, there are already more than 91,900 cooperatives in the province. Most of the members of the cooperatives that were dissolved and the members who withdrew from the cooperatives due to the erroneous policy of "resolutely shrinking" this spring have now rejoined the new or old cooperatives. About 80% of the province's 2.3 million poor and lower-middle peasant households have joined cooperatives.

The great development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the province has come to an end, and at present, the work of rectifying and consolidating the new cooperatives is being carried out in an all-round way in conjunction with production. At present, most of the new cooperatives have established labor organizations and production order, and some are dealing with specific issues such as land, draught cattle, agricultural implements joining the cooperatives, and investment. More than 4,200 townships in the province have completed or are carrying out production planning work. Many new cooperatives have formulated plans to expand production next year and long-term plans for developing production.

The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently instructed party committees at all levels throughout the province to properly arrange rural work for the next five months in order to strive to achieve semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization throughout the province after the autumn harvest next year.

According to this newspaper, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial district committee secretary meeting from November 20th to 27th. After deeply criticizing right-leaning ideas and correctly understanding the rural situation, the district and county committee secretaries attending the meeting unanimously agreed to the provincial committee's plan for agricultural cooperativization in the province.

This winter, including the already established 35,000 cooperatives, a total of about 90,000 agricultural production cooperatives will be established in Hunan Province, with peasant households joining cooperatives accounting for about 35% of the total number of peasant households in the province. By the end of next year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the province will reach more than 130,000, and the number of peasant households joining cooperatives will account for 80% of the total number of peasant households in the province, basically completing semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization.

At the meeting, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized that not only should the plan for developing agricultural cooperatives be completed this winter, but these 90,000 new and old cooperatives should also be run well. Oppose the task view of only pursuing quantity and disregarding quality, and especially seriously implement the party's class policy and the principle of voluntary mutual benefit.

    河北省已基本实现农业合作化
    浙江湖南两省农村明年可实现合作化
    据新华社保定二日电　河北省已经基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。到十一月底，全省入社农户已经占农户总数的百分之七十，有二十一个县入社农户达到了百分之八十以上。今冬明春全省各地将在原有一百一十三个高级社的基础上，再由基础较好的老社转成四百多个高级社。
    从十一月初中共河北省委指示各地全力进行整顿巩固农业生产合作社的工作后，以处理入社生产资料和开展冬季生产为中心内容的整社运动，就在各地全面展开。目前，在全省新建立的六万二千多个农业生产合作社中，有四万六千多个社已经完成或基本上完成了生产资料入社的评价和制定社章等工作，并且选出了以贫农和下中农为核心的领导骨干。在原来九万七千个老社的基础上经过扩建、合并的六万四千多个社，除积极处理扩建和合并以后的一些问题外，还在秋收分配中总结了过去增产的成功经验和检查了经营管理当中存在的问题。
    现在大部分农业生产合作社都订出了今冬明春的生产计划，迎接新的生产高潮。
    新华社杭州二日电　浙江省加入农业生产合作社的农户已经超过全省农户总数的一半。
    截至十一月底止，全省新建立了农业生产合作社五万四千四百五十四个，加上原有的社，全省已经有九万一千九百多个社。各地今年春天因采取“坚决收缩”的错误方针而解散的社的社员和退社的社员，现在大部分重新加入了新社或老社。全省二百三十万户贫农和下中农已经有百分之八十左右入了社。
    全省农业合作化运动的大发展已告一段落，目前正结合生产全面进行整顿巩固新社的工作。现在大部分新社已经建立了劳动组织和生产秩序，有的正在处理关于土地、耕牛、农具入社和投资等各项具体问题。全省有四千二百多个乡已经结束或正在进行生产规划工作。许多新社已经制定了明年扩大生产的计划和发展生产的远景计划。
    中共浙江省委员会最近指示全省各级党委妥善安排好今后五个月的农村工作，为明年秋后实现全省半社会主义农业合作化而努力。
    本报讯　中共湖南省委在十一月二十日到二十七日召开了全省区委书记会议。到会的各地、县、区委书记在深刻批判右倾思想和正确认识农村形势之后，一致同意省委提出的全省农业合作化规划。
    今年冬天，湖南全省连同已建立的三万五千多个社在内，将共建立起九万个左右的农业生产合作社，入社农户约占全省总农户的百分之三十五。明年年底，全省农业生产合作社将达到十三万多个，入社农户将占全省总农户的百分之八十，基本上完成半社会主义的农业合作化。
    在会议上，中共湖南省委强调指出，今冬不但要完成发展农业合作社的计划，还要把这九万个新、老社办好。反对只追求数量不顾质量的任务观点，特别是要认真执行党的阶级政策和自愿互利原则。
