Xinjiang Bayi Steel Plant has completed its annual steel production plan ahead of schedule. The qualification rate of steel ingots throughout the year reached the planned targets. The steelmaking workshop of this plant implemented an administrative responsibility system, strengthened technical management, and launched labor competitions, which halved the auxiliary production time for each furnace of steel, and the daily output of steel increased month by month. From January to November 29 this year, steel production increased by 55% compared to the same period in 1954, equivalent to nine times the steel production in 1952. In February this year, the successful trial of a new operation method for directly refining carbon steel in alkaline Bessemer converters created favorable conditions for the mass production of carbon steel needed for manufacturing agricultural tools.

    新疆八一钢铁厂完成产钢计划
    新疆八一钢铁厂已经提前完成了今年生产钢的计划，全年钢锭的合格率都达到了计划指标。这个厂的炼钢车间推行了行政责任制，加强了技术管理，开展了劳动竞赛，使每炉钢的辅助生产时间缩短了一半，钢的日产量逐月提高。从今年一月到十一月二十九日，生产的钢比一九五四年同时期增加了百分之五十五，相当于一九五二年钢产量的九倍。今年二月份，在碱性贝氏炉中直接炼成炭钢的新操作法试验成功后，更为大量生产制造农具所需的炭钢创造了有利条件。
