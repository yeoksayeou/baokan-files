    Expel the Chiang Kai-shek Clique from the United Nations

    The vast majority of countries in the United Nations have made tremendous efforts to break the deadlock on the issue of admitting new member states. Thanks to these efforts, this issue is nearing resolution, and peace-loving countries and people around the world are anticipating its resolution. However, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, exploiting its usurped seat on the Security Council, wantonly engaged in sabotage, rendering the efforts of the aforementioned countries futile and completely dashing the expectations of the world's people. This heinous act by the Chiang Kai-shek clique is a great insult to the United Nations organization. All upright people cannot help but express great indignation at this.

    As everyone knows, on December 8, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution by a vast majority of fifty-two votes to two regarding the simultaneous admission of eighteen countries to the United Nations, instructing the Security Council to accept the applications of all eighteen countries without exception, based on the general opinion of the member states, so that this session of the United Nations General Assembly could resolve this issue in accordance with everyone's wishes. People believed that the will of the vast majority of member states reflected in the General Assembly's resolution should be given importance by the Security Council. The Security Council began deliberating the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations on December 10. The Soviet representative firmly expressed support for the General Assembly's resolution, agreeing to admit all eighteen countries to the United Nations. Representatives of countries such as Britain and Peru also advocated passing a positive proposal regarding the approval of the participation of the eighteen countries in the United Nations. However, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, with malicious intent, actually proposed thirteen proposals, demanding only the admission of thirteen countries including South Vietnam and South Korea. This absurd proposal was naturally opposed by the majority of the Council members. However, when the Security Council began voting on the applications of the eighteen countries on December 13, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has done all kinds of evil, actually used its position as a permanent member of the Security Council, which it had seized, to veto the Security Council's implementation of the General Assembly's resolution, preventing the issue of admitting new member states from being resolved, and preventing all eighteen countries from entering the United Nations.

    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique dares to act so recklessly, and there are obviously reasons for this. Fair-minded public opinion in various countries has long pointed out that the sabotage activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique on the issue of the United Nations admitting new member states are instigated and encouraged by the United States. The Chiang Kai-shek clique should have been expelled from the United Nations organization long ago. The reason why the United States has always insisted on forcing this clique into the United Nations is to use it as a tool to sabotage the United Nations. Anyone with a brain can see that it is the United States standing behind the Chiang Kai-shek clique that vetoed the plan to admit the eighteen countries in the Security Council. The attitude of the US representative Lodge at the Security Council meeting on the 10th fully confirmed this point. In his speech, he stubbornly continued to express his opposition to the admission of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations, and supported the position of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He said: The United States believes that South Vietnam and South Korea "meet the necessary conditions for participating in the United Nations." Isn't this the clearest indication of whose instructions the Chiang Kai-shek clique is acting on?

    People cannot help but ask, why is the United States so stubbornly obstructing the breaking of the deadlock on the issue of the United Nations admitting new member states? Facts show that the United States not only does not want the five people's democratic countries such as Albania to enter the United Nations, but also does not want to open the door to the United Nations for some other countries. Some American newspapers and periodicals reflecting the opinions of the Washington authorities have repeatedly revealed that American policymakers believe that most of the eighteen applicant countries do not suit their tastes. For example, the "Report of the American Foreign Policy Association" not long ago worriedly pointed out that if all eighteen applicant countries were admitted to the United Nations, it would greatly strengthen the anti-colonialism and opposition to the economic expansion of Western countries in the United Nations. This is the reason why the United States has tried its best to prevent the issue of admitting new member states from being resolved.

    The ugly behavior of the United States instigating the Chiang Kai-shek clique to engage in sabotage this time has seriously damaged the cause of the United Nations in maintaining peace and promoting international cooperation. This fact once again proves how fearful the US ruling clique is of the further easing of the international situation. At the same time, people cannot but come to the conclusion that allowing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to continue to occupy a seat in the United Nations is a huge harm to the United Nations as an organization for maintaining peace.

    The Chiang Kai-shek clique, which fundamentally does not represent anyone, has actually vetoed the common wishes of seventy countries in the world. This is enough to show that the majority of countries in the United Nations can no longer postpone the fundamental deprivation of the illegal status of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the United Nations.

### 把蒋介石集团赶出联合国

    把蒋介石集团赶出联合国
    联合国中绝大多数国家，为了打开接纳新会员国问题的僵局，进行了极大的努力。由于这些努力，这个问题已经接近了解决，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民都在期待着它的解决。但是，蒋介石卖国集团利用它篡夺来的在安全理事会中的席位，肆意进行破坏，使上述国家的努力前功尽弃，使世界人民的期待完全落空。蒋介石集团的这一罪恶行为，是对联合国组织的莫大侮辱。一切正直的人们都不能不对此表示极大的愤慨。
    大家知道，联合国大会十二月八日以五十二票对两票的绝大多数通过了关于同时接纳十八个国家加入联合国的决议，责成安全理事会根据会员国的普遍意见，毫无例外地接受十八个国家的申请，以便本届联合国大会能够合乎大家愿望地解决这个问题。人们认为联大的决议所反映的绝大多数会员国的意志，应当受到安理会的重视。安理会十二月十日开始审议接纳新会员国参加联合国问题。苏联代表坚决表示支持联大的决议，赞成接纳全部十八个国家参加联合国。英国、秘鲁等国家的代表也主张通过一项关于批准十八国参加联合国的积极性建议。但是蒋介石集团存心捣乱，竟提出十三项提案，要求只接纳包括南越和南朝鲜在内的十三个国家，这种荒谬的提案当然受到多数理事国的反对。然而当安理会十三日开始表决十八国的申请的时候，无恶不作的蒋介石集团竟利用它所窃踞的安理会常任理事国的地位，以否决权来阻挠安理会贯彻大会的决议，使接纳新会员国问题不能得到解决，使十八个国家全部不能进入联合国。
    蒋介石卖国集团居然敢于这样胡作非为，显然是有原因的。各国公正舆论早已指出，蒋介石集团在联合国接纳新会员国问题上进行的破坏活动，受到美国的唆使和鼓励。蒋介石集团早就应该被驱逐出联合国组织，美国所以一直要把这个集团硬塞在联合国之中，就为的是要利用它作为破坏联合国的工具。任何有头脑的人都可以看得出，在安理会中否决了接纳十八个国家的方案的是站在蒋介石集团背后的美国。美国代表洛奇十日在安理会会议上的态度就完全证实这一点。他在发言中仍然顽固地表示反对接纳阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和蒙古人民共和国参加联合国，并且支持蒋介石集团的立场。他说：美国认为南越和南朝鲜“符合参加联合国所必要的条件”。这难道不是最清楚不过地说明蒋介石集团究竟是奉了什么人的意旨而行事的吗？
    人们不禁要问，美国为什么这样顽固地阻挠打开联合国接纳新会员国问题的僵局？事实说明，美国不仅不愿意让阿尔巴尼亚等五个人民民主国家进入联合国，而且也不愿为其他一些国家打开联合国的大门。反映华盛顿当局意见的一些美国报刊就不止一次透露，美国决策者认为十八个申请国中大部分的国家都并不合乎他们的胃口。像“美国外交政策协会会报”不久以前曾忧心忡忡地指出，如果十八个申请国都被接纳参加联合国，就会大大增强联合国中反殖民主义和反对西方国家进行经济扩张的力量。这就是美国所以千方百计使接纳新会员国问题得不到解决的缘故。
    此次美国唆使蒋介石集团进行捣乱的丑恶行径，严重地损害了联合国维护和平和促进国际合作的事业。这一事实再一次地证明，美国统治集团是如何恐惧国际局势的进一步和缓。同时，人们也不能不得出这样的结论：让蒋介石集团继续窃踞联合国中的席位，对于一个作为维护和平事业的组织的联合国是个多么巨大的危害。
    根本不代表任何人的蒋介石集团竟然否决了世界上七十个国家的共同愿望，这就足以表明，联合国中的大多数国家根本剥夺蒋介石集团在联合国中的非法地位已经不能再推迟了。
