Conduct Organized and Disciplined Labor
He Cheng

Working in an agricultural production cooperative means the members work together. With so many people working together, will it turn into a "free-for-all"? Some newly established cooperatives do not have good labor organization or strict labor discipline. Everyone asks the cooperative director for work, and the director, lacking experience, finds it difficult to arrange the work in the cooperative properly. This leads to the phenomenon of a "free-for-all."

What should be done? Many old cooperatives that are ahead have gained a lot of good experience. Some comrades who have visited the Soviet Union have also flexibly applied the advanced experience of Soviet collective farms according to the local actual conditions, leading the collective labor in the cooperative in an orderly manner. The draft model charter for agricultural production cooperatives has summarized the experiences of various places in Chapter VII, which is specifically for solving this problem. Following Chapter VII will surely organize the collective labor in the cooperative well and prevent the "free-for-all" situation from happening again.

Organize Production Teams and Divide into Production Groups

What good ways of organizing labor are in the draft model charter? It stipulates that members should be organized into several production teams, with the production team serving as the basic form of labor organization. What is the basic form of labor organization? This means that the various production labor in the cooperative is mainly carried out in this organizational form. That is to say, each production team can operate independently, and the various farm tasks for a period and each day should be arranged within the production team. How large should a production team be? This is not specified in the draft model charter. The land, labor, crops planted, farm tools used, sideline occupations managed, and the concentration or dispersion of residence conditions vary from place to place and from cooperative to cooperative. The convenience of having a certain number of people working together independently also varies, so it is impossible to have a unified regulation. Generally speaking, it can be larger in the plains and smaller in the mountains.

The number of people in a production team is still quite a lot, and it is still inconvenient for the entire team to work together on some tasks. What should be done? The draft model charter stipulates that temporary production groups can be formed as needed. If the cooperative is very small and dividing it into two production teams would make it inconvenient to carry out independent activities, what should be done? The draft model charter also stipulates that such small cooperatives can only be divided into production groups and not set up production teams.

What is the difference between a production team and a production group? A production team can independently arrange production activities and should generally be fixed throughout the year (when it is first established, if everyone feels that it is not entirely certain that production in teams is adequate, the size of the team and who is in which team may not be entirely appropriate, and the production team can also be a seasonal or tillage stage organization); a production group cannot independently arrange production activities and is generally formed temporarily.

There are several types of production teams in agricultural production cooperatives. Those doing work in the fields are called field production teams; those specializing in raising livestock are called livestock production teams; and those specializing in sideline occupations are called sideline production teams. After the field production team is fixed throughout the year, the land managed by each team and the draft animals and farm tools used should gradually be fixed throughout the year as well. The field production team is something that every larger agricultural production cooperative should have. Livestock production teams and sideline production teams can be established according to actual needs. If it is necessary to have someone specialize in these areas, but it is not necessary to establish a production team, then livestock production groups and sideline production groups can be established.

Rational Division of Labor, Clear Responsibilities

Once production teams and production groups are formed, the responsibility system in production can be implemented. If dozens or hundreds of laborers all ask the cooperative director for work, the cooperative director will certainly not be able to manage it, and the phenomenon of a "free-for-all" will inevitably occur. If they are divided into smaller units, with the team leader and group leader leading everyone to divide the work within their own team or group, it will be much easier. There are many things to do in the cooperative. If it is not clear which things are to be done by whom, it is inevitable that things that should be done will be missed or not done carefully. Once divided into teams and groups, it will be clear who is in charge of what. If the crops on a certain piece of land managed by a certain team do not grow well, everyone will give their opinion to that team, and it will be easy for the cooperative director and management committee to investigate the responsibility. There are many draft animals and farm tools in the cooperative. If everyone pulls them for use at will, it is inevitable that they will be damaged or lost. Once divided into teams, draft animals and farm tools can be assigned to each team for exclusive use, and whoever damages or loses them is responsible. This not only makes it less likely to be chaotic, but also makes it easier to encourage everyone to compete with each other to see which team or group does the best work.

After dividing into teams and groups, there are still quite a few people in the team or group. Will there not be small chaos in the team or group even if there is no major chaos in the entire cooperative? The draft model charter has the following provisions: a production team has a team leader, and a production group has a group leader. The production team leader and group leader should pay attention to correctly assigning work to each person in their team or group. If possible, the team leader and group leader should also assign each person a certain plot of land or job and make them responsible for it. After finishing work each day, the team leader and group leader should also check the work performance of each person in their team or group and record the labor days that each person should receive according to the regulations of the cooperative. What does it mean to allocate work correctly? It means that it should suit the needs of production, suit each person's expertise, and take care of each person's specific circumstances (for example, female members who are pregnant or menstruating should be assigned light work; elderly, weak, sick, and disabled members should also be assigned appropriate work as much as possible). Some people with weak labor power are unwilling to join the cooperative, fearing that they will not be able to do the work assigned after joining. There are also some people who are afraid that the distribution of work will not be fair after joining the cooperative, or that their expertise will not be brought into full play. It is inevitable for people who have not lived in a collective to have these concerns; however, after reading the provisions in the draft model charter, they can know that these concerns are superfluous.

According to the provisions of the draft model charter, each team must base its arrangements for production for a period and each day on the production plan of the entire cooperative. Which things are to be done by which team, which land is to be cultivated by which team, what crops are to be planted on which land, etc., are all planned within the scope of the entire cooperative. When the cooperative assigns work to each team, it should arrange it appropriately so that each team can have work to do regularly. After the field production team has a fixed organization throughout the year, the cooperative can also adjust or temporarily transfer the personnel, draft animals, and farm tools of the production team when necessary. The director, deputy director, and other responsible staff of the cooperative should regularly and systematically check the work of each team and group. The election of the cooperative's leaders, financial management, distribution of income, and many other tasks must also be carried out uniformly within the scope of the entire cooperative.

Assigning work to individual members, and even assigning each person a certain plot of land or a certain job, doesn't this become individual farming again? How can the superiority of collective labor in the cooperative be demonstrated? It should be understood that assigning work to individuals in the cooperative is very different from individual farming. Individual farming means that each household has to do everything by itself. Plowing, planting, hoeing, pest control, drought resistance, harvesting, and threshing are all done by oneself. One grows one's own cotton, wheat, rice, and beans. To run a sideline occupation, one has to find one's own raw materials, make them oneself, and then go out to sell them oneself. Regardless of whether one has expertise or not, one has to do it; regardless of whether one is busy or not, one has to do it oneself when it is time to do it. Assigning plots of land to individuals does not mean that individuals can plant whatever they want on whichever plot they want, nor does it mean that individuals can plant whatever they want on this plot, nor does it mean that all the work on this plot from plowing to harvesting is done by one person; it simply means that the work on this plot that is suitable for the individual is assigned to the individual, and the individual is responsible for the work on this plot.

Everyone Sets the Rules, Everyone Obeys Them

After joining the cooperative, can one do as much work as one wants? That won't do. If whoever doesn't want to work doesn't work, how can the cooperative increase production? The draft model charter stipulates that members must do enough labor days, except in special circumstances (such as old age, weakness, disability, etc.) and with the permission of the members' congress. Will that restrict people too much, making it impossible to run a small family sideline, visit relatives, or do some housework? That is not the case either. When the cooperative assigns work to members, it will definitely take these things into account. The draft model charter also stipulates the labor discipline that members should abide by: no unauthorized absenteeism; listen to commands when working; ensure the quality of labor; and protect public property. Anyone who violates labor discipline should be educated and criticized. If the circumstances are serious, they should also be given punishment - their labor days should be deducted, they should be required to compensate for losses, their positions should be revoked, and they can even be expelled from the cooperative.

With discipline, isn't that not freedom? It should be known that these disciplines must be agreed to by the members when the cooperative's charter is formulated. They are not formulated by a few people to rule over the majority, but to protect the interests of all members. With discipline, there is true freedom. In the days of individual farming, one had to starve when disasters struck, and one had to borrow money and be exploited when one fell ill. Where was the true freedom? After joining the cooperative, if everyone does whatever they want, you will hinder my freedom, and I will hinder your freedom, and in the end, no one will be free. If draft animals and farm tools are damaged, everyone will no longer have the freedom to use draft animals and farm tools. If everyone is not active in going to work and does work sloppily, production will be reduced, and everyone will no longer have the freedom to live a good life.

Only organized and disciplined collective labor is the happiest and most free labor. In the draft model charter, the blueprint for this kind of collective labor track has been designed for agricultural production cooperatives throughout the country. Peasants who have not yet joined the cooperative, rest assured to organize cooperatives and participate in cooperatives to jointly build this track! Peasants who have already joined the cooperative, lay the collective labor track according to this blueprint and move forward at full speed on this track!

    进行有组织有纪律的劳动
    何成
    农业生产合作社里做活，是社员们大伙儿一起干。那么多人一块儿干，会不会弄成“一窝蜂”呢？有些刚办起来的合作社，没有很好的劳动组织，没有严格的劳动纪律，大家都向社长要活干；社长因为缺乏经验，也很难把社里的活安排好。这就发生了“一窝蜂”的现象。
    这该怎么办呢？走在前头的许多老社，已经得到很多好经验了；有些去苏联参观过的同志，还按照本地的实际情况灵活地运用了苏联集体农庄的先进经验，把社里的集体劳动领导得井井有条。在农业生产合作社示范章程草案里，已经把各地的经验作了总结；第七章就是专门解决这个问题的。照着这第七章办事，准能把社里的集体劳动组织好，准能叫“一窝蜂”的情形不再发生。
    编生产队，分生产组
    示范章程草案里有些什么组织劳动的好办法呢？它规定了：应该把社员编成几个生产队，把生产队作为劳动组织的基本形式。什么叫劳动组织的基本形式呢？这就是说：社里的各种生产劳动，主要的都是按这样的组织形式来进行。也就是说：各个生产队都能独立活动；一个时期的和每天的各种农活，都要在生产队里安排。一个生产队该有多大呢？这一点，示范章程草案上没有规定。各个地方各个合作社的土地、劳力的多少、种植的作物、使用的农具、经营的副业、居住的集中或分散等等条件都不一样，究竟要多少人在一起独立进行生产活动方便，也就都不一样，没法统一规定。一般地说：在平原可以比较大一些，在山地可以比较小一些。
    生产队里的人还是不很少，有些活全队一起干还是不方便，怎么办？示范章程草案上规定：可以按照需要分成临时的生产组。如果合作社很小，分成两个生产队就都不便于进行独立活动了，该怎么办呢？示范章程草案上也已经规定了，这样的小社可以只分生产组，不设生产队。
    生产队和生产组有什么不一样？生产队能独立地安排生产活动，一般地说应该是常年固定的（刚建立的时候，如果大家觉得分成队来生产还不是十分有把握，队的大小和谁在哪个队也不一定完全合适，生产队也可以是一个季节或者一个耕作段落的组织）；生产组不能独立地安排生产活动，一般地说是临时组成的。
    农业生产合作社的生产队有几种。做地里活的，叫田间生产队；专管饲养牲畜的，叫畜牧生产队；专管副业的，叫副业生产队。田间生产队常年固定以后，各个队负责经营的土地，使用的耕畜、农具，也应该渐渐做到常年固定。田间生产队是每个比较大的农业生产合作社都应该有的。畜牧生产队和副业生产队可以按照实际的需要来设立。如果需要有人专管这些方面的事情，可是不必要设立生产队，那就可以设立畜牧生产组和副业生产组。
    合理分工，责任分明
    分成了生产队和生产组，就可以实行生产中的责任制了。如果几十个几百个劳动力，都向社主任领活干，社主任当然管不过来，就难免发生“一窝蜂”的现象；分成了比较小的单位，队长组长领导着大伙儿在自己队里组里分工，就好办得多了。社里的事情很多，如果分不清哪些事情归谁做，就难免漏掉该做的事或者做得不精细；分成了队和组，哪些事归谁管，一清二白；哪块地是哪个队管的，如果庄稼长不好，大家就会对哪个队提意见，社长和管理委员会要查清责任也容易。社里的耕畜、农具很多，如果大家随便拉着用，就难免伤害、丢失；分成了队，就可以把耕畜、农具分给各队专用，谁用坏了、丢失了谁负责。这样，不但不容易乱了，还便于鼓励大家互相比赛，看哪个队哪个组的工作做得最好。
    分成了队和组以后，队里组里的人还是不少，全社的大乱不会有了，队里组里不会有小乱吗？示范章程草案里有这样的规定：生产队设队长，生产组设组长。生产队长和组长应该注意正确地给本队本组每个人分活干。如果可能的话，队长和组长还应该给每个人指定一定的地段或者是工作，让他负责专管。每天做完了活，队长和组长还应该检查本队本组每个人的工作成绩，并且根据社里规定的办法把每个人应得的劳动日登记下来。怎样叫正确地分配工作呢？就是：既适合生产的需要，又适合各人的专长，又照顾各人的具体情况（比如，女社员怀孩子的时候和来月经的时候应该分给轻活干；对老弱病残的社员也要尽可能分给适当的活干）。有些劳力弱的人不愿意入社，怕入社以后分给的活干不了；还有些人怕入社后分派工作不公平，或者恐怕自己的专长发挥不出来。没过过集体生活的人有这些顾虑是难免的；可是，看了示范章程草案上的规定，就可以知道，这些顾虑是多余的。
    按照示范章程草案的规定，各个队安排一个时期的和每天的生产的时候，必须根据全社的生产计划。哪些事情归哪个队做，哪些土地归哪个队种，哪些土地上种什么庄稼，等等，都是在全社的范围里规划的。合作社给各个队分配工作的时候，要适当地安排，使各个队都能经常有工作。田间生产队有了常年固定的组织以后，在必要的时候，合作社对于生产队的人员、耕畜、农具还可以调整或者临时调动。合作社的主任、副主任等负责工作人员，要经常地有计划地检查各个队和组的工作。社里的领导人员的选举、财务管理、收益分配和别的许多工作，也都必须在全社的范围统一进行。
    给社员个人分活干，甚至还要给每个人指定一定的地段或者是一定的工作，这岂不又成了单干吗？怎样能显示出来合作社集体劳动的优越性呢？要知道，社里把工作分给个人干，和单干大不相同。单干，就是不管什么活都得一家一户自己干。要自己耕、自己种、自己锄，治虫、抗旱还得自己，收割打场又是自己。棉花自己种，麦子、稻子、豆子也是自己种。经营副业，要自己弄原料、自己做，还得自己出去卖。不管自己专长不专长，都得干；不管忙过来忙不过来，该干的时候就只有自己干。给个人分地段，并不是个人想种哪一段就种哪一段，也不是个人想在这地段上种什么就种什么，也不是这地段上的活从耕到收都是一个人干；只是说，分给个人做这个地段上的适合个人做的工作，个人要对这个地段的工作负责。
      大家定纪律，大家来遵守
    入了社，是不是想干多少活就干多少呢？那可不行。要是谁不想干就不干，合作社怎么能增加生产？示范章程草案规定：社员除了特殊情形（比如老弱残疾等等）得到社员大会许可的以外，都必须做够一定的劳动日。那会不会把人限得太死，要经营一点家庭副业、要走亲戚、要做些家务事都不行？也不是的。社里给社员分活干的时候，一定会照顾到这些。示范章程草案还规定了社员应该遵守的劳动纪律：不无故旷工；劳动的时候听指挥；保证劳动的质量；爱护公共财产。有人不守劳动纪律，就要对他进行教育和批评；如果情节严重，还要给他以处分——扣他的劳动日，要他赔偿损失，撤销他的职务，甚至可以把他开除出社。
    有纪律，岂不是不自由了吗？要知道，这些纪律要在制定社的章程的时候经过社员同意，并不是少数人定出来统治多数人的，而是为了保障全体社员的利益。有纪律，才有真正的自由。单干的时候，遇到灾害就只有挨饿，害了病就只好借债受剥削，哪有真正的自由？入了社，如果大家都想怎么着就怎么着，就会你妨碍我的自由，我妨碍你的自由，结果弄得谁也不自由。耕畜农具使坏了，大家就都没有了使用耕畜农具的自由。大家都不积极出工，做活做得毛毛草草，减产了，大家就都没有了过好日子的自由。
    只有有组织有纪律的集体劳动才是最幸福最自由的劳动。在示范章程草案里，已经为全国的农业生产合作社设计好了这种集体劳动的轨道的图样。还没有入社的农民，放心地组织合作社，参加合作社，来共同建设这样的轨道吧！已经入社的农民，按照这个图样来铺设集体劳动的轨道，在这轨道上开足火力前进吧！
