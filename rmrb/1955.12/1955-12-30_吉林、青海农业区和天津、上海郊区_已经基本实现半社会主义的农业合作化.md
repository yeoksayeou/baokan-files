Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, December 29th: Jilin Province has reached 75% of its farm households joining cooperatives, basically achieving semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization.

Currently, the vast majority of the first batch of more than 12,000 new cooperatives established throughout the province have established the leadership advantage of poor peasants, and the evaluation of remuneration for means of production is relatively reasonable. These cooperatives are now transitioning to winter production work such as collective water conservancy and manure digging. A small number of new cooperatives are undergoing rectification in conjunction with the "Four Appraisals," and it is expected that all of them can be put into production by early January. At present, the leadership focus throughout the province has begun to shift to Party consolidation and cooperative rectification work. 40,000 new and old cooperatives have begun to formulate production plans to achieve the 1957 grain production increase target.

Among the more than 700 districts and villages that had achieved cooperativization in 1954, the masses are actively demanding to try out large cooperatives and advanced cooperatives. Currently, there are 2,000 large cooperatives with more than 100 households each in various places. Throughout the province, about 1,000 cooperatives engaged in agriculture, vegetable cultivation, animal husbandry, and ginseng are carrying out the work of establishing advanced cooperatives. In addition, more than 400 small spontaneous advanced cooperatives, after review and rectification by county and district leaders, have been merged into large advanced cooperatives.

This newspaper, Xining, December 29th: Qinghai Province's agricultural areas have basically completed semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. As of now, including the original 876 old cooperatives, a total of 4,028 agricultural production cooperatives have been built in the agricultural areas of the province, with more than 160,000 farm households joining, accounting for more than 82% of the province's total farm households. Among these agricultural production cooperatives, there are not only cooperatives organized by single ethnic groups, but also cooperatives jointly organized by farmers of several ethnic groups. Agricultural production cooperatives have been established among Han farmers and minority ethnic groups such as Hui, Tibetan, Tu, and Salar. At present, all counties in the agricultural areas have shifted to the work of rectification and consolidation of cooperatives. Members of the new and old agricultural production cooperatives are actively purchasing farm tools, draught animals, accumulating fertilizer, and repairing canals to welcome next year's production upsurge.

Qinghai Province has also piloted 50 advanced cooperatives of a completely socialist nature in areas with suitable conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 28th: Farm households in the suburbs of Tianjin participating in agricultural production cooperatives have reached 71,994, accounting for 82.71% of the total number of farm households in the suburbs.

In the tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement, many poor and lower-middle peasants in many townships in the suburbs of Tianjin have joined the cooperatives. According to statistics from twelve townships in the Jinbei District up to early December, among the farm households who signed up to join the cooperatives, poor peasants accounted for 47.5%, lower-middle peasants accounted for 37.2%, and upper-middle peasants accounted for 15.3%. Driven by poor and lower-middle peasants, many wealthy middle peasants and many elderly, weak, widowed, and disabled farm households with no labor force have also signed up to join the cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 28th: The suburbs of Shanghai have basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. Farm households participating in agricultural production cooperatives have accounted for 80% of the total number of farm households in the suburbs. The number of agricultural production cooperatives has reached 1,808. This development speed is half a year ahead of the plan initially formulated by the Shanghai Suburban Work Committee of the CPC in September.

The characteristics of the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the suburbs of Shanghai in the past three months are short time, many cooperatives established, and new cooperatives have quickly gotten on the right track. According to survey materials, good and relatively good cooperatives account for 95%, and relatively poor cooperatives account for 5%. Currently, these new cooperatives are undergoing rectification and consolidation work.

At present, many old cooperative members are demanding to organize advanced-stage agricultural production cooperatives. In order to adapt to this new situation, the Shanghai Suburban Work Committee of the CPC held a meeting of cooperative ministers from various districts on the 13th to specifically discuss the development of advanced cooperatives.

    吉林、青海农业区和天津、上海郊区
    已经基本实现半社会主义的农业合作化
    据新华社长春二十九日电　吉林省入社农户达到农户总数的百分之七十五，基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。
    现在，全省第一批建立的一万二千多个新社，绝大部分树立起贫农领导优势，生产资料报酬的评议比较合理。这些社正在转入集体修水利、挖粪肥等冬季生产工作。少数新社正结合“四评”进行整顿，预计一月上旬可以全部转入生产。目前，全省各地领导重点，开始转入整党和整社工作。四万个新社和老社已经开始制定明年实现一九五七年粮食增产指标的生产规划。
    在一九五四年已经实现合作化的七百多个区、村中，群众积极要求试办大社和高级社。现在各地已经有二千个百户以上的大社。全省有一千个左右经营农业、蔬菜、畜牧和人参的社正在进行建立高级社的工作。另有四百多个小型的自发高级社，经过县区领导审查和整顿后，已并成大型的高级社。
    本报西宁二十九日电　青海省农业区已经基本上完成了半社会主义的农业合作化。截至目前为止，连同原有的八百七十六个老社在内，全省农业区已经建成四千零二十八个农业生产合作社，入社农户有十六万多户，占全省总农户的百分之八十二以上。在这些农业生产合作社里，不仅有单一民族组织起来的社，还有几个民族的农民共同组织的社。汉族农民和回、藏、土、撒拉等少数民族中，都已经建立了农业生产合作社。目前，农业区各县已经转入整顿和巩固社的工作。新、老农业生产合作社的社员们正在积极添购农具、耕畜、积肥、修渠，迎接明年的生产高潮。
    青海省还在有条件的地区试办了五十个完全社会主义性质的高级社。
    据新华社天津二十八日电　天津市郊区参加农业生产合作社的农户已经达到了七万一千九百九十四户，占郊区农户总数的百分之八十二点七一。
    在农业合作化运动的浪潮中，天津市郊区许多乡的贫农、下中农都入了社。据津北区十二个乡到十二月上旬的统计，报名入社的农户中，贫农占百分之四十七点五，下中农占百分之三十七点二，上中农占百分之十五点三。在贫农、下中农带动下，不少富裕中农和许多孤寡老弱无劳动力的农户也纷纷报名入社。
    据新华社上海二十八日电　上海市的郊区已经基本上实现半社会主义的农业合作化。参加农业生产合作社的农户已经占郊区农户总数的百分之八十。农业生产合作社的数目已经达到一千八百零八个。这个发展速度比九月间中共上海市郊区工作委员会初步拟定的计划提前了半年。
    三个月以来，上海市郊区农业合作化运动发展的特点是时间短，建社多，新社已经迅速走上正常轨道。根据调查材料表明：质量好的和比较好的社占百分之九十五，比较差的社占百分之五。现在，这批新社正在进行整顿和巩固工作。
    目前，许多老社社员纷纷要求举办高级阶段的农业生产合作社。为了适应这种新形势，中共上海市郊区工作委员会在十三日举行了各区合作部长会议，专门讨论了发展高级社的问题。
