(Reported by this newspaper) Our country's agricultural scientific research work, under the care and support of the Communist Party and the People's Government and thanks to the help of Soviet experts and the efforts of agricultural scientists, has made significant achievements in recent years. According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, a total of 617 agricultural scientific research results have been achieved in various regions, of which 194 are original. These agricultural scientific achievements have played a significant role in the development of agricultural production.

In recent years, agricultural scientific workers in various regions have cultivated and identified many superior varieties of grain, cotton, and other crops, achieving significant yield increases. Currently, there are about 60 to 70 superior varieties of grain crops being widely promoted in various regions, covering a planting area of 300 million mu. Feng Ruiju, an agricultural scientific worker at the Xiongyue Agricultural Experiment Station in Liaoning Province, cultivated the superior rice variety "Weiguo," which has a unit area yield 15 to 40 percent higher than the locally better "Luyu No. 132" variety. Liaoning Province plans to expand the planting area by 200,000 mu in 1956, which is expected to increase rice production by more than 30 million jin. The East China Agricultural Science Research Institute cultivated the superior rice variety "Yixianhong," which is suitable for double-cropping rice and wheat areas and has a yield that is about 10 to 15 percent higher than other varieties. It has now been promoted in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other places. Zhao Hongzhang, a professor at the Northwest Agricultural College, cultivated the superior winter wheat varieties "Bima No. 1" and "Bima No. 4." The planting area in 1954 reached about 10 million mu. Calculating an increase of 20 jin per mu, this year it increased wheat production for the country by more than 200 million jin. The Northwest Agricultural College used "Jingyang No. 60" and "Zhongnong No. 28" to hybridize "Xinong 6028," and the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute selected "2419" wheat seeds, both of which have characteristics of resisting wheat midges. These two wheat varieties have been tested in areas with wheat midge damage in Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, Anhui, Sichuan, and other provinces, increasing production by 30 percent. Agricultural scientific workers in Northeast China have also selected and bred five superior spring wheat varieties, "Cooperation No. 1" to "Cooperation No. 5." These five new wheat varieties have strong resistance to rust and high and stable yields. In normal years, they yield more than 30 percent more than ordinary varieties, and in years when rust is prevalent, their yields can be twice as high as ordinary varieties. This year, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and other provinces have sown 900,000 mu of these varieties of wheat. By 1957, these improved varieties can be universally adopted for spring wheat in Northeast China.

Significant achievements have also been made in the selection of superior cotton varieties in various regions. More than a dozen superior cotton varieties have been promoted and achieved results, covering a planting area of 60 million mu. The East China Agricultural Science Research Institute used Michurin's theory of "asexual hybridization and distant hybridization" to select and breed three superior varieties, "Longrong No. 1," "Longrong No. 2," and "Longrong No. 3." Among them, the fiber length of "Longrong No. 3" (Sea Island cotton) reaches a maximum of 5.2 cm, and is generally 3.8 to 4 cm, which can spin 80 to 100 count yarn, and is the best quality cotton variety in our country. Next year, the scope of trial planting of these superior varieties will be expanded in Shanxi, Jiangsu, and other places. Various regions have also selected new cotton seeds suitable for double-cropping cotton areas, such as "Feng 50-53" and "Jiangpu No. 8," which are now being accelerated for propagation and preparation for promotion. In addition, agricultural scientific workers in various regions have also selected superior varieties of corn, millet, sugarcane, and other crops. At the same time, agricultural scientific research units in various regions have also begun to collect and study the original materials of various major crops. About 10,000 varieties of rice and wheat alone have been collected, some of which have been analyzed for their developmental stages, laying a good foundation for the introduction and cultivation of new varieties in the future.

Agricultural scientific research workers in various regions have also summarized and studied the comprehensive yield-increasing technical experience of major crops such as rice, wheat, and cotton, thus effectively guiding and helping farmers to improve farming techniques and increase yields. The 15 agricultural experiment farms and stations in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have summarized a series of cultivation techniques for cotton, such as sowing period, density, irrigation, and pruning. After applying this set of yield-increasing techniques to 50,000 mu of cotton fields, a large area of cotton was harvested, with an average yield of more than 400 jin of seed cotton per mu. Agricultural scientific workers in northern provinces have summarized the comprehensive technology for increasing cotton and wheat production in the plains, which has played a significant role in production. Agricultural scientific workers in southern provinces have also summarized the dense planting technical specifications for different varieties of rice, different cultivation systems, and different climates, thus making it easier for farmers to master the technology of dense rice planting. Various regions have also solved the methods of preventing seedling rot and cultivating strong seedlings. In Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces, seedling fields that promoted the cultivation of strong seedlings accounted for 80 percent of the total seedling fields, which played a positive role in reducing rice seed losses and increasing yields. Various regions have also found ways to prevent sweet potato rot and potato degeneration, as well as the manufacture and use of various pesticides and agricultural machinery.

In terms of pest and disease control, agricultural scientific workers in various regions have also researched many effective methods. Rice stem borers are more serious in southern rice paddies. Agricultural scientific workers in Jiangxi Province proposed a method of destroying rice roots and irrigating fields during the period when stem borers begin to pupate from larvae in February and March, when their resistance to unfavorable environments is weak. This method of destroying rice roots to control stem borers has been very effective in various southern provinces. The East China and South China Agricultural Science Research Institutes have also researched methods for controlling rice paddy stem borers with 666 pesticide powder. The Shandong Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute found that wheat bunt is mainly transmitted through manure fertilizer, so it proposed a method of separating manure and seeds to eliminate wheat bunt. Now, after applying this method throughout the province, wheat bunt has been nearly eliminated. In general, the development rules of other major pests and diseases that harm grain and cotton have been studied, and effective control methods have been determined.

In terms of promoting livestock breeding and improving breeds, as well as preventing various animal epidemics, various regions have also researched some achievements, which have played a certain role in the development of livestock. Under the assistance of Soviet experts, the Gongnaisi Sheep Breeding Farm in Xinjiang bred China's first Xinjiang fine-wool sheep breed for both wool and meat. Now, about 1 million local coarse-wool sheep have been improved by using this breed of ram in various regions. Northeast China has selected superior new pig breeds and can supply more than 10,000 superior breeding pigs to various regions each year. North China has also carried out sheep improvement and the creation of new breeds. In recent years, artificial insemination technology has been widely promoted in various regions, greatly increasing the conception rate of livestock. The artificial insemination conception rate of horses in local stud farms has reached 90 to 100 percent. Veterinary workers have also created and introduced dozens of veterinary biological drugs and treatment and quarantine methods, thereby controlling the spread of several major infectious diseases. Now, cattle plague, the most harmful disease, has been eliminated throughout the country (except for the Kang Tibetan Plateau region). Effective methods have now been researched to prevent and control animal epidemics such as yak plague, swine fever, sheep plague, and chicken plague on the Kang Tibetan Plateau. Various regions have also researched various methods for storing green fodder to help farmers solve the problem of livestock feed shortages.

    我国农业科学研究成果丰富
    几年来对发展农业生产起了显著作用
    本报讯　各地农业科学研究工作几年来在共产党和人民政府的关怀和支持下，由于苏联专家的帮助和农业科学家的努力，已经有了显著成绩。据农业部最近统计，各地已研究出的农业科学成果有六百一十七项，其中属于创造性的就有一百九十四项。这些农业科学成果对发展农业生产起了很大作用。
    几年来各地农业科学工作者培育和鉴定了许多粮棉等农作物的优良品种，获得了显著的增产效果。现在各地大量推广的粮食作物优良品种约有六、七十种，种植面积达三亿亩。辽宁省熊岳农业试验站农业科学工作者冯瑞聚培育出的优良稻种“卫国”，单位面积产量比当地较好的“陆羽一三二号”品种高百分之十五到四十。辽宁省计划一九五六年扩大种植面积二十万亩，预计可增产三千多万斤稻谷。华东农业科学研究所培育出适于稻麦两熟区的优良稻种“一线红”，产量也比别的品种高百分之十到十五左右，现已在南京、镇江等地推广。西北农学院教授赵洪璋培育成“碧蚂一号”、“碧蚂四号”冬小麦优良品种，一九五四年的播种面积已达到一千万亩左右，每亩以增产二十斤计算，今年就给国家增产了二亿多斤小麦。西北农学院利用“泾阳六○号”和“中农二八号”杂交成的“西农六○二八”和华东农业科学研究所选定出的“二四一九”小麦种，都有抗吸浆虫特性。这两个小麦品种在陕西、河南、山西、安徽、四川等省有吸浆虫害地区试种，增产百分之三十。东北地区的农业科学工作者也选育出“合作一号”至“合作五号”五个优良的春小麦品种。这五个新小麦品种抗锈病能力强，产量高而稳定，在一般年份比普通品种增产百分之三十以上，在锈病流行年份可比普通品种产量高一倍。今年黑龙江、吉林等省已播种了这些品种的小麦九十万亩，到一九五七年东北地区的春小麦可以普遍采用这些良种。
    各地在选育优良棉种方面也取得很大成绩。现已推广和取得成效的优良棉花品种有十多种，种植面积达到六千万亩。华东农业科学研究所运用米丘林的“无性杂交与远缘杂交”的学说，选育出了“长绒一号”、“长绒二号”、“长绒三号”等三种优良品种。其中“长绒三号”（海岛棉）的纤维长度最高的达到五点二公分，一般的也是三点八到四公分，可纺八十至一百支纱，是我国品质最良的棉种。这些优良品种，明年将在山西、江苏等地扩大试种范围。各地还选育出适合于两熟制棉区的“沣五○—五三”、“江浦八号”等新棉种，现已加速繁殖和准备推广。另外各地农业科学工作者还选育出玉米、谷子、甘蔗等农作物的优良品种。同时各地农业科学研究单位还开始进行各种主要作物的原始材料的搜集和研究工作。仅水稻、小麦就搜集了一万种左右，有的已做了阶段发育分析，为今后引种培育新品种打下了良好的基础。
    各地农业科学研究工作者还总结研究了水稻、小麦、棉花等主要作物的综合增产技术经验，因而有效地指导和帮助农民改进耕作技术，提高了产量。新疆维吾尔自治区十五个农业试验场、站总结出棉花的播种期、密度、灌溉、整枝等一系列栽培技术经验，在五万亩棉田运用了这一套增产技术后，获得了棉花大面积丰产，平均每亩产籽棉四百斤以上。北方各省的农业科学工作者总结了平原地区棉麦增产的综合技术，在生产上起了很大的作用。南方各省的农业科学工作者还总结出水稻的不同品种，不同栽培制度，不同气候的密植技术规格，因而使水稻密植的技术易于为农民掌握。各地还解决了防止烂秧和培育壮秧的方法，四川和浙江两省推广培育壮秧的秧田占总秧田百分之八十，对减少稻种损失，提高产量都起了积极作用。各地也找出了防止甘薯腐烂、防止马铃薯退化的办法，以及各种性能的农药、农械的制造和使用方法。
    在防治病虫害方面，各地农业科学工作者也研究出了许多有效的办法。南方水稻的螟害较为严重，江西省农业科学工作者根据螟虫在二、三月间由幼虫开始化蛹的时候对不利环境抵抗力弱的特点，提出在这时来毁灭稻根和灌水田的方法。这个毁灭稻根治螟方法，在南方各省推广效果都很好。华东和华南两农业科学研究所也研究出用六六六药粉防治稻田螟害的方法。山东省农业科学研究所研究出小麦腥黑穗病主要是由于粪肥传染来的，于是就提出粪种隔离法来消灭小麦腥黑穗病。现在全省运用了这个办法后，小麦腥黑穗病已接近消灭。对于其他为害粮棉的主要病虫害，一般都已经研究出它们的发展规律，并且确定了防治的有效方法。
    关于促进牲畜的繁殖和改进品种以及防治各种兽疫等方面，各地也研究出一些成果，对发展牲畜也起了一定作用。新疆巩乃斯种羊场在苏联专家帮助下育成了我国第一个毛肉兼用的新疆细毛羊品种，现在各地已经用这种公羊改良当地粗毛羊约一百万只。东北地区选育出了优良的新猪种，每年可供应各地优良种猪一万头以上。华北地区也进行了绵羊改良和创造新品种等工作。这几年来，各地还普遍推广了人工授精技术，大大提高牲畜的受胎率。各地种畜场马匹人工授精受胎率达到百分之九十至一百。兽医工作者也创造和引进了数十种兽医生物药品及治疗和检疫方法，从而控制了几种主要传染病的流行。现在全国内（除康藏高原地区外）已消灭了为害最大的牛瘟。康藏高原牦牛瘟、猪瘟、羊瘟及鸡瘟等兽疫，现在已经研究出有效的方法来防治。各地还研究出各种青饲料的储藏法，帮助农民解决牲畜饲料缺乏的问题。
