Reverend Fathers, Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ!

On September 8th, Gong Pinmei and others, the former leaders of our Shanghai Diocese, were arrested by the Public Security Bureau in accordance with the law for committing counter-revolutionary crimes. As priests, entrusted with the mission of spreading the Gospel, how can we not feel deeply saddened to see such a serious incident that endangers the motherland and tarnishes the Church occur within the Church! Suppressing our painful feelings, we repeatedly studied the evidence of the crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group published by the People's Government, carefully listened to and watched the recorded and written confessions of Ge Shouping, Fei Youwen, and others, reflected on our own experiences, listened to the just voices of tens of thousands of Catholics, and at the same time prayed for the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. Our conscience urges us to remain silent no longer.

When Gong Pinmei took office as bishop, because he was the first Chinese bishop of the Shanghai Diocese, the vast majority of Catholics in Shanghai had high expectations, hoping that he could lead the diocese in accordance with the spirit of Christianity, and also hoping that he would have national integrity and patriotic enthusiasm. However, the facts of the past six years have been completely the opposite. What is the reason for this? After studying and researching various materials, we understand that Gong Pinmei's appointment as Bishop of Shanghai was recommended single-handedly by Ge Shouping, Cai Ermeng, and others. Ge Shouping, Cai Ermeng, and others are imperialist elements who have been lurking in the Church for a long time. Ge Shouping himself confessed: "I oppose the People's Government and incite others to oppose the government... I secretly organized a priests' 'Aegis' (i.e., a small group, including Chen Tianxiang, Zhu Shude, Jin Luxian, and others, seven people in total) as the core of resistance to the movement led by the People's Government, and I used catechism groups, retreats, and various forms of preaching in various churches to organize forces to oppose the government... I now admit that these behaviors of mine are indeed imperialist behaviors, I admit that I am an imperialist element. I admit these serious errors of opposing the People's Government, which should subject me to severe punishment." Cai Ermeng also confessed to engaging in imperialist espionage activities in our country. However, when Ge Shouping was deported by our People's Government and arrived in Hong Kong, Gong Pinmei wrote a letter to him on the same day, saying: "I hope you are always healthy, and will soon lead us openly again. In fact, I know deeply that you have never given up leading." According to the hierarchy, the bishop should lead the diocese, but Gong Pinmei wanted Ge Shouping to lead, placing himself in a subordinate position. This was already outrageous, and moreover, since Ge Shouping himself admitted to being an imperialist element, Gong Pinmei still wanted him to "soon" "again" lead "openly." What were his intentions? Ge Shouping's confession revealed the truth about Gong Pinmei's request for leadership: "From August 1950 to June 1953, Bishop Gong and I had secret talks three or four times a week, all in the bishop's room. In these talks... I helped Bishop Gong Pinmei oppose the various movements led by the People's Government." Priests and fellow Catholics! Today, we know the ugly situation hidden beneath the beautiful exterior, can we not feel heartbroken? This fully confirms that Gong Pinmei did not prioritize the interests of the motherland and the Church, but the interests of imperialism. No wonder all kinds of abnormal situations have been constantly occurring in the Shanghai Church.

The Apostle Paul said, "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God." (Romans 13:1) It can be seen that obeying the government and abiding by the laws of the country is the duty of every priest and Catholic, especially since the policies and decrees of the People's Government are all for the benefit of the people. However, Gong Pinmei undermined the government's policies and decrees. For example, land reform is in line with the interests of the vast number of peasants and the interests of the country. The fruits of the peasants' hard work are fair; it is unfair for landlords to enjoy the fruits of their labor and exploit the peasants. According to the Catholic principle of advocating fairness, we should support land reform. However, Gong Pinmei instructed Catholics in various places "not to divide the land and property of landlords," and "if they have to be given the land and property of landlords, they should return it to the landlords after the People's Government collapses"; and instructed missionaries in various places "not to recognize the ownership of land distributed to peasants during the struggle against landlords during land reform." May I ask, is this something that a person who upholds fairness should do? Another example is the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. We still vividly remember the lawless and harmful actions of counter-revolutionaries in the old society, and the various sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries after liberation are even more obvious facts. The People's Government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries, eliminating violence and promoting good, and safeguarding national construction is a great thing. However, Gong Pinmei publicly held a "Glorious Mass" in the church for these criminals a year after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, namely on April 27, 1952, calling the families of counter-revolutionaries "Glorious Families"; and even harbored major traitors and major spies such as Xu Ruoyu and Deng Jiajun in the Xujiahui Seminary and in the Dongjiadu Church. Churches and seminaries are sacred places, and traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries are criminals. Is it tolerable to hide these criminals in our sacred places?

Protecting the country and defending the homeland is the duty of every citizen. The catechism explains: "When the country is in trouble, protect the country regardless of your own life and property." The American imperialists were unwilling to accept their failure on the Chinese mainland and launched a war of aggression against Korea, the purpose of which was to invade China and attempt to restore the rule of the Kuomintang in China. The Chinese people's resistance to American aggression and aid to Korea was just and necessary, but Gong Pinmei falsely accused it, saying that "it is unreasonable to engage in an unjust war under the pretext of defending the country alone." However, at the same time, they did not hesitate to tarnish the holy name of the Virgin Mary to praise the American imperialists' war of aggression, spreading rumors that "the Virgin appeared in the skies over South Korea, and the American army will surely win." And saying that "the Third World War is about to break out, and Chiang Kai-shek is about to counterattack the mainland." Does this still sound like a Chinese person? Is there still a religious atmosphere of peace and love?

Love of country is a matter of course, recorded in the Fourth Commandment of the Ten Commandments. Jesus also said, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." (Matthew 22:21) Our love of country is precisely to abide by Jesus's teachings, and it is the concrete manifestation of loving the Church. In the past, we often felt that the country was weak and bullied by foreign powers, unable to hold our heads high. Now we have driven away the imperialists, and the motherland is indeed strong, with a bright and splendid future. This is the achievement of the People's Government. The People's Government is the best government in Chinese history, and everything it does is for the benefit of the people. The People's Government has indeed implemented a policy of freedom of religious belief. The government does not interfere with our purely religious matters, nor with our purely religious ties with the Holy See, nor does it force us to abandon our faith. The government respects our Catholicism, and protects legitimate religious activities. Moreover, people's lives are stable, the social atmosphere has improved, and morality has been raised. Social evils such as prostitution, gambling, gangsters, and thieves have been basically eliminated. This not only reduces our opportunities to commit crimes, but also provides a good environment for us to cultivate virtue and do good deeds. We should thank God and love the country led by the People's Government even more. However, Gong Pinmei and others tried every means to prevent us from loving our own country, asking us to "not see, not listen, not speak," isolate ourselves from the new society, not allow us to trust and approach the People's Government, not allow us to hold meetings, study, and participate in anti-imperialist and patriotic activities, and not allow Catholic children to participate in the Young Pioneers, which aims to love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, and protect public property. They deliberately distorted and slandered the righteous actions of Catholics who love the country and love the Church as "anti-Church" and "schismatic," and used divine authority to impose strikes or excommunications. They created disunity between priests and Catholics, between priests and priests, and between Catholics and Catholics, causing some priests and Catholics to feel depressed, uneasy, and at a loss. They also deliberately created an atmosphere of "religious persecution," cursed the new China as a "dark world," and slandered the People's Government as a "devil." Precisely because they hated the new China and the People's Government so deeply, they engaged in countless lawless counter-revolutionary activities, such as establishing the "National Salvation Revolutionary Party" and secretly sending counter-revolutionary elements to various parts of the country to carry out sabotage activities and collect all kinds of intelligence to supply to imperialist intelligence agencies. These are all undeniable facts. All of this is of course intolerable by the law of the land, not permitted by the canons of the Church, and will certainly be opposed by the people of the whole country and despised by all Catholics. Gong Pinmei and others used the name of religion to carry out so many political activities that undermine the country, which is completely inappropriate for a bishop or priest to do. Thanks to God's wise arrangement, the People's Government has taken wise measures to save our Shanghai Church from the dead end to which Gong Pinmei had led it.

In the above-mentioned criminal activities, many were carried out by us through Gong Pinmei. We admit that we mistakenly obeyed the orders of people like Ge Shouping and Gong Pinmei and did many things that were unworthy of God above and unworthy of the people below, and we have let down the country and the Catholics. Catholic clergy and laity across the country love their country and their religion with vitality, but under the control of Gong Pinmei, we were not only lifeless but also seriously hindered the development of the patriotic movement of Catholics in Shanghai, causing Catholics spiritual distress and various damages, and also affected the patriotic movement of Catholic clergy and laity in various places. The criminal behavior of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group occurred in the Shanghai Diocese for such a long time, and not only did we not emulate Jesus' spirit of upholding justice and opposing evil, but we did not distinguish right from wrong, and even blindly obeyed, covered up, and defended them. Therefore, we feel deeply ashamed, remorseful, and painful. But shame, remorse, and pain alone are of no avail. We should accept this painful lesson, correct the mistakes we have made in the past, make up for the losses we have caused in the past, and should take responsibility and bravely embark on the road of loving the country and loving the Church. Jesus said: "Ye are the salt of the earth", "Ye are the light of the world". (Matthew 5:13, 14) Only by fulfilling the duty that God has entrusted to us to lead Catholics to love God and love others, and fulfilling the obligations that a citizen should fulfill to his country, can our salt be salty and our light shine, and be pleasing to God. Dear priests and Catholics! Now is the time for us to act. For the benefit of our country and for the future of our Church, we are determined to work together with all clergy and laity to achieve the following three points:

(1) Distinguish right from wrong, draw a clear line between the people and the counter-revolutionaries, raise vigilance, and resolutely prevent imperialists and counter-revolutionaries from using our Church again, using religion as a guise to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, undermine the motherland, and tarnish the Church.

(2) Strive to study, improve patriotic consciousness, fulfill the responsibilities of the people, abide by government policies and decrees, respond to government calls, enthusiastically participate in patriotic activities, and contribute to the construction of the motherland and the defense of peace.

(3) Strengthen the unity between priests and Catholics on the basis of loving the country and loving the Church, promote the spirit of loving God and loving others, and fulfill the duty of loving the country and loving the Church.

Dear priests and Catholics! Let us unite closely, and work together with the clergy and laity across the country, help each other, encourage each other, learn from each other, and strive to thoroughly implement the above tasks. Our responsibility is great, the task is arduous, relying on the help of God's grace and the intercession of the Virgin Mary, grant us the faith and strength to turn our determination into action and turn it into reality.

May Christ grant you peace!

### 上海天主教神职界告神长教友书

1955-12-11
第3版()
专栏：

    上海天主教神职界告神长教友书可敬的神父们，亲爱的教友们！
    九月八日，我们上海教区原来的领导人龚品梅等因为犯了反革命罪行而被公安局依法逮捕了。我们身为司铎，负有传扬福音的使命，看到教会里发生了这样一件危害祖国和玷污教会的严重事件，怎能不感到无比痛心呢！我们抑制着痛苦的心情，反复地研究了人民政府公布的关于龚品梅反革命集团的罪证材料，细心地听了并看了格寿平、斐有文等的口供录音和亲笔供词，联想到自己的亲身经历，倾听了成千成万教友的正义呼声，同时祈求天主圣神的光照，良心催促着我们再不能沉默不言了。
    当龚品梅就任主教时，因为他是上海教区第一任国籍主教，上海广大教友期望甚殷，希望他能根据基多精神，领导教区，同时也希望他能有民族气节和爱国热情。可是六年来的事实竟完全相反，这究竟是什么原因呢？自从学习和研究了各种材料之后，我们明白龚品梅的被任为上海主教，是由格寿平、才尔孟等所一手保举的。而格寿平、才尔孟等是长期来潜藏在教会内的帝国主义分子，格寿平自己供认：“我反对人民政府以及煽动别人反对政府……我秘密地组织了一个神父‘爱纪伯’（即小集团，包括陈天祥、朱树德、金鲁贤等七人）作为对抗人民政府所领导的运动的核心，而且我利用教理小组、避静、各堂口的各种讲道形式、组织力量，反对政府……我现在承认我这些行为确实是帝国主义的行为，我承认我是帝国主义分子。我承认这些反对人民政府的严重错误，应使我受到严厉的处分。”才尔孟也供认在我国进行帝国主义间谍活动。然而当格寿平被我人民政府驱逐出境到达香港时，龚品梅竟当天就写信给他，说：“希望你健康如恒，不久仍会公开领导我们，实际上我深知你从未放弃领导。”按照圣统，应该主教领导教区，而龚品梅却要格寿平来领导，自己处在被领导的地位，这本来已经太不像话了，又何况格寿平既然自己承认是帝国主义分子，龚品梅还要他“不久”“仍会”“公开”来领导，这是什么居心呢？格寿平的供词说出了龚品梅要求领导的真相：“自一九五○年八月至一九五三年六月我和龚主教每星期要密谈三、四次，都是在主教房间内进行的。我在这些谈话中……帮助龚品梅主教反对人民政府所领导的各项运动。”神父教友们呵！今天我们知道了这种外表好看内里脏臭的情形，难道能不感到痛心吗？这完全证实了龚品梅不是以祖国和教会的利益为前提，而是以帝国主义的利益为前提，怪不得在上海教会内不断发生种种反常的情形了。
    保禄宗徒说：“一总的人都该服从有权柄的上司，因为权柄没有不是从天主来的。”（罗马书拾叁·一）可见服从政府遵守国法是每个神父教友的本分，何况人民政府的政策法令都是为了人民的利益。而龚品梅却破坏政府政策法令。譬如，土地改革是符合广大农民的利益和国家的利益的。农民辛勤劳动所得是公道的；地主坐享其成剥削农民是不公道的。根据天主教主张公道的道理，应该拥护土地改革。而龚品梅竟指示各地教友“不得分地主的土地和财物”，“如果不得不分到地主的土地和财物，则应在人民政府垮台后，把它归还地主”；又指示各地传教士“不得承认土改时斗争地主分给农民的土地所有权”。试问，这难道是一个主持公道的人所应做的事情吗？又如镇压反革命，反革命分子在从前旧社会里无法无天残害人民的情形，今天我们都记忆犹新，而解放后反革命分子的种种破坏活动更是事实昭彰，人民政府镇压反革命，除暴安良，保障国家建设，这是天大的好事情。而龚品梅又在镇压反革命后的一年，即一九五二年四月二十七日在教堂里公然为这些罪犯举行“光荣弥撒”，称反革命分子家属为“光荣家属”；甚至，在徐家汇修道院以及在董家渡堂内窝藏大汉奸大特务徐若愚、邓家俊等。教堂修院是圣洁的地方，汉奸、特务、反革命分子是犯罪的人，把这些犯罪的人藏在我们圣洁的地方，这难道是可以容忍的吗？
    保家卫国，人之天职。教理详解上说：“国家有难，不顾身家性命，保护国家。”美帝国主义不甘心在中国大陆上的失败，发动侵略朝鲜的战争，其目的就是为侵略中国，企图使美蒋统治在中国复辟。中国人民抗美援朝是正义的也是必要的，而龚品梅竟诬蔑说“单以保卫国家为借口而从事一种不正义的战争是说不过去的”。可是同时他们却不惜玷污圣母的圣名，去颂扬美帝国主义的侵略战争，造谣说：“圣母在南朝鲜上空显圣，美国军队一定胜利。”又说：“第三次世界大战就要爆发，蒋介石马上要反攻大陆。”这还像是一个中国人吗？还有和平爱人的宗教气息吗？
    爱国是天经地义的，载在十诫的第四诫。耶稣也说过：“责撒肋的归责撒肋，天主的归天主。”
    （玛窦贰拾贰·二十一）我们爱国正是遵守耶稣的圣训，是爱教的具体表现。过去我们常感到国势衰弱，受外国欺侮，抬不起头来，现在我们赶走了帝国主义，祖国确实强大了，前途光明灿烂，这是人民政府的功绩。人民政府是中国历史上从未有过的好政府，所做的事情都是为人民谋福利。人民政府确实贯彻宗教信仰自由的政策，凡是我们纯宗教方面的事情，与圣座纯宗教上的联系，政府不加干涉，也不强迫我们放弃信仰。政府对我们天主教是尊重的，正当的宗教活动是保护的。再说，人民生活安定，社会风气改善，道德提高，如娼妓、烟赌、流氓、盗贼已基本肃清，这不但减少了我们犯罪的机会，而且对我们修德立功来说也有了好的环境。我们应该感谢天主，应该加倍热爱人民政府领导的国家。而龚品梅等千方百计的阻止我们爱自己的国家，要我们“不看、不听、不讲”，同新社会隔绝起来，不许我们信任和靠拢人民政府，不许我们开会、学习和参加反帝爱国的活动，不许教友儿童参加以爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物为宗旨的少年先锋队，故意歪曲和诬蔑教友的爱国爱教的正义行动为“反教”、“裂教”，并且利用神权以停止圣事或绝罚，加以打击。制造神父与教友之间、神父与神父之间、教友与教友之间的不团结，使得一些神父教友苦闷不安无所适从。他们还有意制造“教难”空气，诅咒新中国为“黑暗世界”，诬蔑人民政府为“魔鬼”，正因为他们对新中国与人民政府是这样的恨之入骨，因此像建立“救国革命党”等反革命组织，秘密派遣反革命分子到全国各地进行破坏活动，收集各种情报供给帝国主义间谍情报机关等无法无天的反革命活动也就层出不穷。这些都是无可置疑的事实，凡此种种，当然为国法所不容，教规所不许，也一定被全国人民所反对，一众教友所唾弃。龚品梅等假借宗教名义做出这许多破坏国家的政治性活动，完全不是一个主教、神父应该做的事情。感谢天主上智的安排，人民政府已采取了英明的措施，使我们上海的教会从被龚品梅所带到的绝路上挽救过来。
    在以上例举的罪恶活动中，有许多是由龚品梅通过我们执行的。我们承认错听了格寿平、龚品梅这等人的命令，做了许多上有愧于天主下有负于人民的事情，对不起国家，对不起教友。全国各地神长教友爱国爱教，生气蓬勃，而我们在龚品梅的控制下不但死气沉沉，而且严重阻碍了上海教友爱国运动的开展，造成教友精神苦闷和种种损害，同时也影响了各地神长教友爱国运动的进行。龚品梅反革命集团的犯罪行为出现在上海教区为期如此之久，我们不仅没有效法耶稣伸张正义反对罪恶的精神，而且没有分辨是非，甚至盲目服从包庇辩护，因此我们深深感到羞愧、悔恨和痛苦。但光是羞愧、悔恨、痛苦是无济于事的。我们应该接受这次沉痛的教训，纠正过去所犯的错误，弥补以往所造成的损失，应该负起责任来，勇敢地走上爱国爱教的道路。耶稣说过：“你们是地上之盐”、“世上之光。”（玛窦伍，十三、十四）只有尽好天主所交给我们领导教友爱主爱人的本分，尽好一个公民对自己国家应尽的义务，我们的盐才能有味，光才能发亮，而为天主所喜悦。各位亲爱的神父教友！现在是我们行动的时候了，为了我们国家的利益，为了我们教会的前途，我们决心和全体神长教友共策共励做到下列三点：
    （一）明辨是非，划清人民与反革命的界限，提高警惕，决不允许帝国主义和反革命分子再利用我们教会，借宗教为名，进行反革命活动，破坏祖国，玷污教会。
    （二）努力学习，提高爱国觉悟，尽好人民的责任，遵守政府政策法令，响应政府号召，热烈参加爱国活动，为建设祖国、保卫和平而贡献力量。
    （三）在爱国爱教的立场上加强神父教友之间的团结，发扬爱主爱人的精神，尽好爱国爱教的本分。
    各位亲爱的神父教友！让我们紧密团结起来，和全国各地神长教友同心协力，互助互勉，互相学习，为彻底实现上述各项任务而努力。我们的责任是重大的，任务是艰巨的，靠托天主圣宠的帮助和圣母玛利亚的转求，赐我们有信心有力量将决心成为行动化为现实。
