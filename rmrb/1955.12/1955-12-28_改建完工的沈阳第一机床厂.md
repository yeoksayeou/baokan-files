    The Rebuilt Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant

    The entire reconstruction project of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has been completed. Currently, the builders are finishing the last batch of finishing touches, such as the bicycle garage and charging room. In a little while, this new type of machine tool manufacturing plant will officially start production.
    The reconstruction of this factory began on April 16, 1953. From the entry of raw materials to the exit of finished products, the factory operates entirely on an assembly line, allowing a 1A62 lathe to be assembled in a very short time. 80.1% of the factory's machinery and equipment are supplied by fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia. In order to fundamentally guarantee product quality and to trial-produce new products at any time according to national needs, the factory also has its own central laboratory, central measurement room, process testing laboratory, and trial-manufacturing hydraulic workshop and other scientific research institutions.
    Each workshop in the factory has shower rooms, changing rooms, washrooms, and welfare facilities such as dust removal and ventilation, reducing physical labor to a minimum. The casting workshop, which was always a heavy manual labor area, is completely mechanized here, from sand making, melting, and molding to transportation. The factory also has more than 10,000 meters of green areas, making the entire factory resemble a labor park dotted with flowers.
    Advanced technical data, streamlined process regulations and production organization, first-class machinery and equipment, and superior working conditions make the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant a highly efficient machine tool manufacturing plant capable of mass, batch, and single production of multiple varieties. After this factory reaches its designed level, its production capacity will be at least six times higher than in 1953 before the reconstruction. It can not only produce various specifications of medium-sized lathes with fast speed, strong capabilities, wide applications, and high precision, but also produce special machine tools urgently needed by various sectors of China's national economy. The machine tools produced by the factory each year can equip several giant factories of the same scale.

    改建完工的沈阳第一机床厂
    修英
    沈阳第一机床厂全部改建工程已经完成了。现在，建设者们正在完成自行车库、充电室等最后一批收尾工程。再过一些时候，这座新型的工作母机制造厂，就要正式开工生产了。
    这座工厂是从一九五三年四月十六日开始改建的。这个厂从原材料入厂到成品出厂，完全是流水作业，很短时间就可以装配出一台一A六二车床。全厂百分之八十点一的机器设备，都是苏联、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克等兄弟国家供给的。为了从根本上保证产品质量，随时根据国家需要来试制新产品，厂内还有自己的中央化验室、中央测量室、工艺试验室和试造液压车间等科学研究机构。
    全厂每个车间都有淋浴室、更衣室、盥漱室和吸尘、通风等福利装置，体力劳动被减少到最低限度。从来都是笨重的手工劳动的铸造车间，在这里，从制砂、熔化、造型到搬运，完全是机械化。全厂还有一万多公尺的绿化区，整个工厂像是一座花卉点缀的劳动公园。
    先进的技术资料，流水的工艺规程和生产组织，头等的机器设备，优越的劳动条件，使沈阳第一机床厂成为一座效率极高的可以大批、成批、单个生产的多品种的工作母机制造厂。这个厂达到设计水平以后，生产能力将比改建前的一九五三年至少提高六倍以上。它不但可以生产速度快、能力强、用途广、精密度高的各种规格的中型车床，还可生产我国国民经济各部门迫切需要的特殊机床。全厂每年生产的工作母机，可装备好几座同样规模的巨型工厂。
