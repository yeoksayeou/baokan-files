The Zhuang people, numbering approximately 6.6 million, reside predominantly in the western part of Guangxi Province. Due to the policies of national oppression adopted by reactionary rulers throughout history, the Zhuang people have long been in a state of political, economic, and cultural backwardness. They do not have their own written language. Since liberation, particularly after the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Zhuang people have urgently demanded the creation of a script capable of representing their ethnic language, in line with political, economic, and cultural development.

After the founding of New China, the state began helping ethnic minorities who did not yet have a written language to create one, and to help ethnic minorities whose written languages were incomplete to improve them. In May 1954, the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences first selected the Zhuang people as a key focus to begin work to help ethnic minorities create a written language. The Zhuang Language Work Team, jointly organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the People's Government of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, conducted nine months of investigation and research in various parts of the autonomous region, collecting rich materials in terms of phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar. In May of this year, the Nationalities Affairs Commission and the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences sent personnel to Guangxi, together with Soviet advisor and linguist Comrade Serdyuchenko, and under the leadership of Comrade Qin Yingji, Chairman of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, convened the work team to conduct research. After repeated discussions, the basic dialect and standard pronunciation were determined. A preliminary plan for the Zhuang script has now been proposed, and after extensive consultation and review, it can be piloted.

The first problem encountered in helping the Zhuang people create a written language was how to deal with the dialectal differences in the Zhuang language. Can the Zhuang people use one written language? Is it to determine a standard language and use the help of written language to gradually unify the various divergent dialects, or to determine two basic dialects and use written language to help gradually unify them into two standard languages, leaving the distance between the two to be resolved in future development? Generally speaking, the linguists engaged in Zhuang language research tend to favor the latter. After conducting an analysis mainly based on phonetic differences, they believe that it is difficult to unify the northern and southern dialects of the Zhuang language into one written language. However, many local Zhuang cadres only agree with the former, and even believe that the issue of dialectal differences is not a problem at all. It now seems that the opinions of the Zhuang cadres were correct in direction, but at the time they were unable to propose specific solutions to resolve these differences.

According to the Zhuang Language Work Team's survey of fifty-one locations, the Zhuang language was initially divided into eight dialect areas. The general situation of this division is: the Liujiang River basin dialect, the Hongshui River basin dialect, the Northern Yong dialect, the Youjiang River basin dialect, the Guibian dialect, the Zuojiang River basin dialect, the Southern Yong dialect, and the Dejing dialect. The first five are Northern dialects, and the latter three are Southern dialects, while the Youjiang and Guibian dialects are particularly close to the Southern dialects (mainly in terms of phonetics). Thus, the situation of dialect area division is already very complicated, and many phonetic comparison issues have not yet been considered. Based on this analysis, the Zhuang Language Work Team initially proposed five basic dialect locations as candidates. The discussion resulted in approximately two aspects of opinion: one is that if it is determined that it is impossible to develop one set of characters, then Longjin should be selected for the south and Laibin should be selected for the north; the other is that if the plan to develop only one set of characters is adhered to, there are two points to choose from: Wuming can be selected to take both the north and south into account to a certain extent in terms of language, and it has more convenient conditions in terms of politics, transportation, and culture; the selection of Laibin is based on the fact that it has a relatively large area where communication is basically possible, but the county seat of this county does not use the Zhuang language.

Here, another question arises: according to what criteria should the basic dialect be selected, and what exactly is a basic dialect? Stalin said: "Certain local dialects can become the basis of a national language in the process of the formation of a nation and develop into an independent national language. ... As for the other dialects in these languages, they lose their uniqueness, dissolve into these languages, and disappear in these languages." Marx said: "The concentration of dialects into a unified national language is determined by economic and political concentration." The Zhuang people are a minority ethnic group that has suffered oppression for a long time, and its economic and political concentration has only become possible after liberation. Of course, we are not allowed to wait until the economic and political concentration of this nation has already formed before solving the problem of its basic dialect. Then, the remaining question is, which dialect can develop into the basic dialect of the national language?

Here, I would like to mention that there has been such a view: fundamentally denying the role of basic dialects in the work of creating a written language. Those who hold this argument believe that since writing is a written symbol representing language, then regardless of what language is, it is necessary to develop a written language separately, even if it is only used between a few villages. And they believe that the work of developing a written language is only a matter of implementing government orders, and creating a written language only requires finding one or two people to record the sounds, and it can be completed in three or two days. Of course, there are not many people who hold this view, but until recently there were still people insisting on this view. There is also another view that raises the question of "selecting a basic dialect" to the question of "selecting a basic dialect location." Precisely because what is selected is only such a point, the primary requirement for this point is internal consistency, and the issue of how this point is connected with the broad masses is not really raised for research, and this selection of a basic dialect location is sometimes only a district or a village, and this selection of a district or village is often difficult to reach a consensus on. The work of creating the Zhuang script before April of this year was precisely in a situation similar to this, where it was trying to align with a point, but there were many different opinions on the issue of selecting a point.

After repeated study, it was considered inappropriate to divide the Zhuang language into eight dialect areas. The division of dialects should be based on Stalin's linguistic theory, that is, focusing on grammatical structure and basic vocabulary, and not simply based on phonetic comparison. Therefore, the Zhuang language can only be divided into two types: Southern dialect and Northern dialect. Determining the basic dialect should also only raise the issue for these two dialect areas. Based on the comparison of vocabulary between the northern and southern dialects of the Zhuang language (70 percent of the 2,400 common vocabulary words are the same or similar), based on the grammatical comparison (basically consistent), based on the Zhuang people's demand to use one written language, and other conditions, the two dialect areas of the north and south of the Zhuang people can use one written language. Based on the fact that the population of the Northern dialect area is about 4 million, which is twice the population of the Southern dialect area, and that the Northern dialect is more internally consistent than the Southern dialect, the Northern dialect was determined as the basic dialect, thus effectively ending the debate over the selection of the basic dialect. Here, it is only said that it is effectively ended, because the issue of phonetic standards still needs to be resolved separately.

After the basic dialect is determined, it is also necessary to determine a standard phonetic area to be used as the standard for pronunciation. This standard phonetic area is selected in the Wuming area near Nanning. Because this area is a central area in terms of politics, transportation, culture, and other aspects, it is a county town that uses the Zhuang language, the pronunciation can take both the north and south into account, and it is also valuable in terms of pedagogy.

The basic dialect problem of helping the Zhuang people to create a written language has been solved, but there is still a difficult problem: how should the different local dialects and local languages in various places be handled in the written language? What if it is not unified after writing it out, and you can't understand it? According to Soviet experience: there are two main situations of vocabulary divergence, one is that some vocabulary exists in this area but not in another area (for example, in the southern dialect of Zhuang, there is only one name for tigers and lions, while there are different names in the north), so the richer vocabulary can be absorbed into the standard language; the other is that the same meaning has different vocabulary in different dialects and local languages. Among these vocabularies, many actually still have different meanings, and the problem is that we have not yet figured it out. Even if the meaning is really exactly the same, this only shows that there is one more means of expressing meaning, and with the development of the standard language, it may develop different meanings in use due to the needs of actual life; it is now believed that there will still not be enough divergent vocabularies. For this kind of dialectal difference in the southern dialect, a special care method must be designed to help them learn the standard language. For example, you can specifically add a few unique symbols to the textbooks used by southern students; or the main text of the textbook is the same, and some supplementary pages or vocabulary comparison tables are added to explain; or when necessary, add notes in parentheses in the text. In this way, after only a few years of study, after the standard language is quite popular, this supplementary care method can be dispensed with.

After the Soviet advisor participated in the research, some basic issues regarding the creation of the Zhuang script have been resolved. The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government Zhuang Script Research Steering Committee and the Zhuang Language Work Team drafted preliminary opinions on the basic dialect and standard pronunciation of the Zhuang script based on these opinions. Although the Zhuang script plan has not yet been finalized, a preliminary plan has been proposed. The People's Government of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region plans to start pilot implementation in several major areas from October 1956 after the plan is finalized. The Zhuang people will soon have their own written language.

    僮族文字在创制中
    育然
    僮族约有六百六十万人口，聚居在广西省西半部。由于历代反动统治者采取民族压迫政策，僮族人民长期处在政治、经济和文化落后的状态中。他们没有自己的文字。解放以后，特别是桂西僮族自治区成立以后，随着政治、经济和文化的发展，僮族人民迫切要求创立能够代表本民族语言的文字。
    新中国成立以后，国家就着手帮助还没有文字的少数民族创立文字，帮助文字不完备的少数民族改进他们的文字。一九五四年五月，中国科学院语言研究所首先选择了僮族作为重点来开始帮助少数民族创立文字的工作。由中国科学院和桂西僮族自治区人民政府共同组织的僮语工作队，在自治区的各个地方进行了九个月的调查研究，在语音、词汇、语法等方面都搜集了丰富的材料。今年五月，民族事务委员会和中国科学院语言研究所派人协同苏联顾问、语言学家谢尔久琴柯同志去广西，在桂西僮族自治区主席覃应机同志的主持和领导之下，召集了工作队人员进行研究，经过反复的讨论，确定了基础方言和标准语音。目前已提出了僮文的初步方案，再经过广泛征求意见和审订以后，就可试验推行。
    在帮助僮族创立文字的工作中首先遇到的问题，是如何处理僮语方言分歧的问题。僮族能够使用一种文字吗？是确定一种标准语，借书面语言的帮助来把各种分歧的方言逐渐统一起来呢，还是确定两种基础方言，分别以书面语言去帮助逐渐统一成为两种标准语，而把两者之间的距离留待今后的发展中去解决呢？一般地说，从事僮语研究的语文工作者们的意见是倾向于后一种，他们在进行了以语音差别为主的分析之后，认为僮语的南北方言要统一成为一种文字是很困难的。而当地许多僮族干部却只同意前一种，甚至认为方言分歧的问题根本不是什么问题。现在看来，僮族干部的意见，在方向上说是正确的，但当时并没有能提出如何解决这种分歧的具体办法来。
    根据僮语工作队对五十一个点的调查，最初是把僮语分为八个方言区的。这种划分的大致情形是：柳江流域方言，红水河流域方言，邕北方言，右江流域方言，桂边方言，左江流域方言，邕南方言，德靖方言。其中前五者是北部方言，后三者是南部方言，而右江和桂边方言又有和南部方言特别接近之处（主要是语音上）。这样，方言区划分的情形已经很复杂了，有许多语音比较上的问题还并没有考虑在内。根据这种分析，僮语工作队最初提出了五个基础方言点作为候选地点。讨论的结果大约有这样两个方面的意见：一种是，如果肯定不可能制定一套文字，那末南部就应该选择龙津，北部就应该选择来宾；另一种是，如果坚持只制定一套文字的方案，有两个点可以选择，选武鸣在一定程度上语言方面可以南北兼顾，在政治、交通、文化上较有便利条件；选来宾则是它有一个较为广大的基本上可以通话的地区，但这个县的县城是不用僮语的。
    这里就又碰见了一个问题，基础方言究竟应该根据什么标准来选定，而且还有一个问题，究竟什么是基础方言？斯大林说：“某些地方方言在民族形成过程中可以成为民族语言底基础并发展为独立的民族语言。……至于说到这些语言中的其他方言，那末它们丧失了自己的独特性，溶入这些语言中，并在这些语言中消灭了。”马克思说：“方言集中为统一的民族语言是由经济和政治的集中来决定的。”僮族是长时期遭受压迫的少数民族，它的经济和政治的集中只是在解放后才有可能。当然，不容许我们等待这个民族的经济和政治的集中已经形成了之后，再来解决它的基础方言的问题。那末，剩下的问题是，哪一种方言可以发展成为民族语言的基础方言呢？
    在这里，我想提到，曾经有过这样的看法：根本否认基础方言在创制文字工作上的作用。持这种论调的人认为，既然文字是代表语言的书面上的符号，那末无论一种什么话都要分别地制定文字，不管它只是在几个村落之间使用也是必要的。并且认为，制定文字的工作只是推行政令的问题，创制一种文字只需找一两个人来记一下音，三两天就可以完成。当然，持有这样论调的人是不多的，但直到不久以前还有人在坚持这样的论调。还有另外一种看法，把“选择基础方言”的问题，提成为“选择基础方言点”的问题。正因为所选择的只是这样一个点，对这个点的要求是以内部一致为首要条件，对于这个点如何同广大群众联系的问题又没有真正地提出来研究，而这种基础方言点的选择有时甚至只是一个区或一个村子，这种区、村的选择，又时常很难取得一致意见。僮文的创制工作在今年四月以前，就正是处在类似这样的要向点看齐而又在选点问题上众说纷纭的情况中。
    经过大家反复研究之后，认为把僮语分成为八个方言区是不合适的。划分方言应该按照斯大林的语言学说，即从语法结构和基本词汇着眼，不能单纯从语音比较上来立论。因而僮语只能分为南部方言和北部方言两种。确定基础方言也只应该就这两个方言区来提出问题。根据僮语南北方言词汇上的比较（在二千四百个常用词汇中相同和相近的占百分之七十），根据语法上的比较（基本上是一致的），根据僮族群众要求使用一种文字和其他的一些条件，僮族南北两个方言区是可以使用一种文字的。根据北部方言区的人口约有四百多万，相当于南部方言区人口的两倍，而北部方言的内部也较南部方言为一致等情况，确定了以北部方言为基础方言，这样也就实际上结束了选择基础方言的争论。这里只说实际上结束了，是因为语音标准的问题还须另加解决。
    基础方言确定以后，还须要确定一个作为正音标准之用的标准语音区。这个标准语音区选择在南宁附近的武鸣地区。因为这个地区无论从政治、交通、文化等各方面来说，都是一个中心地区，是一个使用僮语的县城，发音能南北兼顾，在教育学上也是有价值的。
    帮助僮族创制文字的基础方言问题解决了，但还有一个难题，各地不同的方言土语在书面语言中应当怎样处理？写出来后不统一，看不懂怎么办？根据苏联的经验：词汇上的分歧主要有两种情况，一种是在这个地区有的词汇在另一地区没有（比如，在僮语南部方言中对老虎和狮子就只有一个名称，而北部是有不同名称的），这样就可以把更为丰富的词汇吸收到标准语里面；另一种是同一个意义在不同方言土语中有各不相同的词汇，在这种词汇中，有许多实际上是仍有不同含义的，问题在我们还没有弄清楚。即使含义真的完全相同，这也只不过说明了表达意义的手段多了一个，随着标准语的发展，也可能由于实际生活的需要，而在使用中发展出不同的含义来；现在认为分歧的词汇是还会感到不够用的。对于南部方言这种方言上的差别，就必须设计一种特殊照顾的办法来帮助他们学习标准语。比如，可以专门在给南部学生使用的课本上，增加几个特有的符号；或者课本的正文是一样的，另加一些补充页或用词汇对照表来说明；或者必要时在课文中用括弧加注。这样只要经过几年的学习，在标准语相当普及了之后，这种补充照顾办法就可以不要了。
    经过苏联顾问参加研究以后，关于创制僮文的一些基本问题，已经得到解决。桂西僮族自治区人民政府僮文研究指导委员会和僮语工作队根据这些意见，草拟了关于僮族文字基础方言和标准音的初步意见。僮文方案虽然还没有最后确定，但初步方案已经提出。桂西僮族自治区人民政府计划在方案确定以后，从一九五六年十月开始，先在几个主要地区试验推行。僮族人民不久就将有自己的文字了。
