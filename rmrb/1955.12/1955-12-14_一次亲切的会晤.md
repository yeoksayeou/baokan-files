    A Cordial Meeting
    Ji Nong
    On December 11th, members of the Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eastern suburbs of Beijing received delegates from all over the country attending the National Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Workers Conference with extreme excitement.

    Around 2 p.m., when the cooperative members heard that the guests were about to arrive, they beat drums and gongs to welcome them at the village entrance. As soon as the car carrying the visiting delegation stopped, the members crowded around the car, warmly shaking hands with the guests and welcoming them into the village. The welcoming ceremony began. Yan Hechun, the director of the cooperative, expressed his gratitude to the visiting delegation, saying: "Our cooperative used double-wheeled double-shared plows to cultivate corn this year, with an average yield of 462 jin per mu, an increase of 87 jin compared to last year. We originally planned to purchase ten double-shared plows this year, but because of the price reduction, we bought twenty-one. Now all the land can be cultivated using double-shared plows. All this is thanks to the help of our worker brothers." He also told the visiting delegation that the Heping Cooperative was formed by merging eight smaller cooperatives, with over two thousand households of new and old members, accounting for more than 90% of the total farm households in the township. A comprehensive plan has been made within the cooperative, and in seven years, the average grain yield per mu will increase from the current 402 jin to 850 jin. The director's introduction greatly encouraged the delegates. Li Chao, director of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, said to the cooperative members on behalf of the visiting delegation: "You are changing so fast, and we must be as fast as you are. We must produce more, better, and cheaper new agricultural implements to support the agricultural cooperation movement. We must work together and move forward side by side."

    After the welcoming ceremony, in the courtyard of the Laiguangying Elementary School, worker and peasant brothers gathered in small groups for cordial conversations. Cooperative director Yan Hechun and Wu Guangcheng, a labor model from the Qiqihar Machinery Factory, were deep in conversation, like old friends who hadn't seen each other for many years. Representatives from the Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Factory inquired in detail about the cooperative's contracting production methods. Female cooperative member Yang Linqing used her own experience to introduce the superiority of the cooperative, saying: She is already sixty years old this year, and because there are suitable tasks to do in the cooperative, she has earned more than 1,300 work points this year. She lifted her clothes to show off to the guests, saying: "This fur coat was bought with this year's labor income."

    The delegates also visited the cooperative's various production facilities and equipment. In the agricultural implement station, they carefully studied the use of agricultural implements. Representatives from the Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory introduced the technical skills for using new agricultural implements to the farm implement operators and recorded the opinions raised by the cooperative members in their notebooks. Engineer Ge Ruitang, who specializes in designing agricultural implements, heard from the cooperative members that the spindle of the double-shared plow had a high wear rate and immediately disassembled it for research in order to improve it back at the factory. They researched and talked, and before they knew it, night had fallen. The delegates and cooperative members bid farewell to each other with mutual encouragement.

    一次亲切的会晤
    纪农
    十二月十一日，北京市东郊区和平农业生产合作社的社员们，以极其兴奋的心情接待了参加全国农具制造工作者会议的各地代表。
    下午两点钟左右，社员们听说客人快来了，敲锣打鼓到村口欢迎。载着访问团的汽车刚一停下，社员们便拥到车前和客人亲切握手，迎接他们进村。欢迎会开始了。社主任燕贺春向访问团人员表示感谢说：我们社里今年使用双轮双铧犁耕种的玉米，平均每亩收四百六十二斤，比去年增加了八十七斤；我们今年原计划购买十部双铧犁，后因降低价格，便买了二十一部，现在全部土地都可以使用双铧犁耕种。这都是工人弟兄对我们的帮助。他还告诉访问团：和平社是由原来八个小社合并起来的，新老社员共有两千多户，已经占全乡总农户百分之九十多。社内已经作了全面规划，七年后，每亩粮食平均产量将从现在的四百零二斤提高到八百五十斤。社主任的介绍大大鼓舞了代表们。北京农业机械厂厂长李超代表访问团向社员表示：你们变化得这样快，我们也要和你们一样的快，我们要生产更多更好更便宜的新式农具，支援农业合作化运动。我们要共同努力、并肩前进。
    欢迎会后，在来广营小学校的院子里，工农兄弟们三五成群地展开了亲切的交谈。社主任燕贺春和齐齐哈尔机械厂的劳动模范吴广成，像多年不见的老朋友一样紧凑在一起谈心。沈阳农业机械厂的代表详细地询问了社里的包工包产办法。女社员杨林清以自己的亲身体会介绍合作社的优越性说：她今年已经六十岁了，因为社里有适当的事可做，今年共得到一千三百多个工分。她揭起衣襟向客人们夸耀说：我这件皮袄就是用今年的劳动收入买来的。
    代表们还参观了社里的各项生产和设备。在农具站里，他们认真地研究了农具使用情况。湖南农业机械厂的代表把新农具使用技术介绍给农具手，并且把社员们提出的意见记在笔记本上。专门设计农具的工程师戈瑞堂听到社员说双铧犁的轴心磨损率很大，当即拆开研究，以便回去改进。他们研究着，交谈着，不知不觉夜色已经降临，代表们和社员们在互相鼓励中告别了。
