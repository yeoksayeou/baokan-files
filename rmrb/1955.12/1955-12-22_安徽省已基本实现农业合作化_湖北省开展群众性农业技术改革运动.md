Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 21st: Anhui Province has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. As of December 20th, the number of farmer households joining cooperatives in the province has reached 75.13% of the total number of farmer households. More than 70% of the households joining cooperatives are poor and lower-middle peasants; new and old upper-middle peasants who have signed up to join cooperatives also account for 70% of their stratum.

Since the autumn of this year, cadres at all levels in Anhui Province have conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" and the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and have launched a vigorous publicity campaign on agricultural cooperativization, setting off a high tide of agricultural cooperativization throughout the province. The socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants has been unprecedentedly high, and peasants in many places have joined agricultural production cooperatives by entire villages and entire townships. In Guoyang County, all the peasants in sixty-one villages in three townships have signed up to join cooperatives; in Wuwei County, all the more than 2,000 peasant households in Yangqiao, Yixu, and Huayuan townships have also signed up to join cooperatives. In the Huaibei Plain, Fuyang and Suxian prefectures have recently seen an average of more than 7,000 peasant households signing up to join cooperatives every day, and an average of more than 190 new cooperatives being established every day.

This year, in the process of establishing agricultural production cooperatives, all localities have generally implemented class policies and the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. The peasants generally have been full of enthusiasm and have shown a high degree of production enthusiasm after joining the cooperatives. During the establishment of the cooperatives, drought was relatively serious in many areas. As soon as the new cooperatives were established, they immediately invested in drought resistance and rush planting, enabling the province to quickly complete more than 90% of the autumn sowing tasks. At present, the focus of work in various parts of the province has shifted to rectifying and consolidating agricultural cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 20th: On the basis of the great development of agricultural cooperativization, Hubei Province is launching a mass agricultural technology reform movement. According to the plan formulated at the recent Hubei Provincial Agricultural Technology Work Conference, the content of the technological reform includes six aspects: popularizing new-style farm tools; popularizing improved varieties; vigorously accumulating fertilizer and improving fertilization; fully utilizing land potential; improving cultivation techniques; and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests.

Hubei Province plans to promote 90,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows next year, and by 1962, all cultivation processes for major crops will use new-style farm tools; and 90 agricultural machinery tractor stations will be established throughout the province. In terms of promoting improved varieties, the main focus is on promoting improved varieties of japonica rice and expanding the planting area of ​​Dai character cotton. Next year, the planting area of ​​improved varieties of various major crops is required to increase by at least half compared with this year. In addition, next year it is required to develop irrigation and convert 400,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields; double-cropping rice will be expanded from 900,000 mu this year to 2.4 million mu; and comprehensive prevention and control of bollworms in cotton fields will begin.

In the first half of December, prefectures, counties, and some advanced townships in Hubei Province formulated plans for agricultural technology reform in their respective regions based on the province's agricultural technology reform plan and the characteristics of their localities, and have already begun implementation. When making technical reform plans, Xishui, Tianmen and other counties held a technical conference of agricultural production cooperatives with thousands of people. More than 110,000 agricultural production cooperatives across the province have listed agricultural technology reform as an important part of their production activities this winter and spring. Millions of farmers have already begun to build farmland water conservancy projects. In the recent winter sowing, although some areas suffered from severe drought, the quality of sowing by the vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives still reached the level stipulated in the technical reform plan.

    安徽省已基本实现农业合作化
    湖北省开展群众性农业技术改革运动
    本报合肥二十一日电　安徽省已经基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。截至十二月二十日统计，全省入社农户已达总农户数的百分之七十五点
  一三。入社农户中百分之七十以上是贫农和下中农；新老上中农报名入社的，也占其本阶层的百分之七十。
    今年入秋以来，安徽省各级干部认真学习了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中共中央七届六中全会（扩大）“关于农业合作化问题的决议”，开展了声势浩大的关于农业合作化的宣传，全省掀起了农业合作化的高潮。广大农民的社会主义积极性空前高涨，许多地方的农民整村整乡地加入了农业生产合作社。涡阳县有三个乡六十一个村的农民全部报名入社；无为县洋桥、义圩、花园等三个乡二千多户农民也全部报名入社。淮北平原的阜阳、宿县两专区，最近平均每天有七千多户农民报名入社，每天平均成立一百九十多个新社。
    今年各地在建立农业生产合作社的过程中，一般都贯彻执行了阶级政策和自愿互利原则，农民入社以后，一般情绪都很饱满，生产积极性很高。建社期间，不少地区旱象比较严重。新社一建立起来，就立即投入抗旱抢种，使全省秋种任务很快完成百分之九十以上。现在，全省各地的工作重心已经转入整顿和巩固农业合作社。
    新华社武汉二十日电　在农业合作化大发展的基础上，湖北省正在开展一个群众性的农业技术改革运动。根据湖北省最近召开的全省农业技术工作会议所订的规划，技术改革的内容有六个方面，这就是：推广新式农具；推广良种；大力积肥，改善施肥；充分利用土地潜力；改进栽培技术；防治病虫害。
    湖北省计划明年推广双轮双铧犁九万部，一九六二年作到主要作物的耕作过程全部使用新式农具；并且在全省举办九十处农业机器拖拉机站。在推广良种方面，主要是推广粳稻良种和扩大岱字棉的种植面积。明年各种主要作物的良种播种面积要求至少比今年扩大一半。此外，明年要求发展灌溉，改四十万亩旱地为水田；双季稻由今年的九十万亩扩大到二百四十万亩；并且开始全面防治棉田里的红铃虫。
      十二月上半月，湖北省各专区、各县和一些先进乡，根据全省的农业技术改革规划和本地的特点制定了本地区的农业技术改革的规划，并且已经着手实施。浠水、天门等县在作技术改革规划的时候，召开了几千人的农业生产合作社技术员大会。全省十一万多个农业生产合作社已经把农业技术改革列为今冬明春生产活动的重要内容。几百万农民已经开始兴修农田水利。在不久以前的冬季播种中，虽然有些地区受了严重的干旱，但是，绝大部分农业生产合作社播种的质量仍然达到了技术改革规划所规定的水平。
