    New Year's Eve
    Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee
    Soviet Writer
    That enchanting moment filled with all sorts of feelings will soon arrive around the world, as the hands of the clock cross the boundary of the old year, and the world steps into the new year.

    The clock on the Spasskaya Tower in Moscow will strike, and traditional bells will ring everywhere, on every continent, followed by people raising their glasses to toast new happiness and congratulating each other on the best of life.

    Newspapers and radio stations will publish various predictions for the new year. The followers of the "Cold War" will, of course, issue the gloomiest forecasts, while the enthusiasts of military blocs will be looking on the map for countries that can still be drawn into military alliances. Some high-ranking pessimists will speak in ambiguous terms about the need to arm.

    At the same time, the peace-loving working people of the East and West, united by their aspirations to prevent war, will raise their glasses to consolidate world peace, and to peaceful life and labor on earth.

    The people of the people's democracies and socialist countries have tasted the joy of free labor and have become masters of their own destiny. They answer the unsolicited "concern" of those gentlemen who call themselves leaders of the so-called "free world" with a disdainful sneer. Do the Chinese laborers, who have gained genuine freedom for the first time and tasted the joy of working for themselves, need protectors and "saviors" from Washington? Do Albanian farmers, who have expanded their cultivated land area by fifty percent, have to listen to those gloomy words about their impending starvation? Will the Bulgarian people's festive banquets be spoiled because they have had a bountiful harvest? Will Polish workers lose their appetite because their republic's industrial output ranks fifth in Europe?

    No matter how the former SS members imagine the militarization of the whole of Germany and fantasize about revenge as the New Year approaches, they will not find sympathy among the broad masses of the German people, who are determined to reunify Germany on a basis of peace and democracy.

    Those who secretly prepare atomic and hydrogen bombs, the weapons that pose the greatest threat to peace-loving people, have unpleasant dreams as the New Year approaches. The ghost of the "Cold War," from the dirty depths that shroud all these preparations, threatens the world, saying that the tragedy leading to the destruction of mankind is inevitable. But the Soviet Union discovered the secrets of atomic energy much faster than expected across the Atlantic, and this secret was publicly introduced in Geneva in August 1955. Scientists from all over the world unanimously advocated that all new discoveries of human genius should be used entirely for peaceful purposes.

    And those who have long used atomic blackmail against peace-loving countries have been greatly shocked by their permanent loss of the monopoly on atomic energy.

    What if the Soviet Union provides atomic piles to the people's democracies and the great China! And to add cyclotrons and all the necessary equipment. All the warlocks of atomic war would weep over this.

    And how much did the adventurous activists hope that the Geneva Four-Power Summit would come to nothing. And when the meeting achieved good results, these gentlemen shouted that when the foreign ministers meet in the same Geneva in the autumn, the "Cold War" would inevitably grow bigger and bigger, like autumn rain.

    And now, on this New Year's Eve, even in the families of those in the West who are far from progressive, it is difficult to find people who support a return to the "Cold War."

    ...Festive Moscow, like all cities and villages in the Soviet Union, welcomes the New Year and rejoices in the great achievements made in both the national economy and international politics. Moscow has just welcomed Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev with warmth and love upon their return from their long journey to India, Burma, and Afghanistan. This was a trip of great worldwide historical significance. All those who are accustomed to thinking honestly and rationally regard this trip as a clear manifestation of peace and friendship, a new and brilliant achievement of the Soviet peace policy, and the victory of the Leninist principles in the Soviet state's foreign policy.

    The people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan welcomed the leaders of the Soviet state as they had never welcomed any foreign guests before. This contains our life, the great truth of our struggle for the freedom and independence of the Soviet state and all peoples, the truth and victory of Lenin's doctrine, and the truth and victory of the Soviet peace policy.

    When Khrushchev spoke at the rally on the day he returned to Moscow, he said:

    "We have the 370 million people of India, as well as the people of Burma and Afghanistan, as our allies in the struggle for world peace.

    "India is a very good friend of our country. India, like the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, stands firmly on the front for peace.

    "As Lenin taught us, India, China, and the Soviet Union, that is an invincible force."

    When welcoming the new year of 1956, the Soviet people look forward to the future with vigor and vitality because of this. They firmly believe that the forces of peace will surely triumph. They are full of confidence in the achievements of the country's great plans, in their great work of transforming nature and raising science, technology, and agriculture to new heights.

    The Soviet people send their blessings to all loyal workers in the world, to all those who strive for world peace and oppose oppression and injustice. They firmly believe that peace will triumph!

### 新年前夕

    新年前夕
    苏联保卫和平委员会主席
    苏联作家                  尼·吉洪诺夫
    那充满了各种各样的感觉的迷人的时刻，很快就要来到全世界，当时针越过旧年的界限，世界就要迈入新的一年。
    莫斯科斯巴斯克钟楼上的时钟将要响起来，各处、各大洲也都要响起传统的钟声，随后人们举杯为新的幸福而欢饮，并互相祝贺最美好的生活。
    报刊和广播电台都要发表对新的一年的各种预言。“冷战”的信徒当然会发出最阴郁的预测，而军事集团的爱好者们将要在地图上寻找那还能拉入军事联盟的国家。一些身居高位的悲观主义者将在暧昧的言词中说需要武装起来。
    同时，为防止战争的热望所团结起来的东西方各国和平的劳动人民，将为巩固世界和平、为大地上的和平生活和劳动而举杯祝贺。
    人民民主国家和社会主义国家的人民已体会到自由劳动的愉快并已成为自己命运的主人。他们以轻视的冷笑回答那些自命为所谓“自由世界”的领袖的先生们对他们的不请自来的“关怀”。难道第一次获得了真正的自由并体会到为自己而劳动的愉快的中国劳动者，需要从华盛顿来的保护人和“救星”吗？难道把自己的耕地面积已扩大了百分之五十的阿尔巴尼亚农民一定要听那关于他们要饿死的阴郁的话吗？难道保加利亚人的节日宴席会因为他们获得了丰盛的收成而变得坏些吗？难道波兰工人会因为他们的共和国的工业品产量已在欧洲占第五位而失掉了胃口吗？
    无论过去的党卫军分子在新年将要来临的时候怎样幻想着使整个德国军国主义化，幻想着复仇，他们在德国广大人民群众中却得不到同情，德国人民正充满决心，力求在爱好和平和民主的基础上重新统一德国。
    那些秘密地准备着原子弹和氢弹这种对和平人民威胁最大的武器的人们，在新年即将来临的时候做着不愉快的梦。“冷战”的魔鬼从笼罩着所有这些准备工作的肮脏的秘密深处威吓全世界说，导致人类灭亡的悲剧是不可避免的。但是苏联发现原子能秘密比大西洋彼岸预料的快得多，这项秘密一九五五年八月在日内瓦被公开介绍出来，世界各国的科学家都一致主张人类天才的新发现要全部用于和平目的。
    而那些曾经长期用原子讹诈政策对待爱好和平的国家的人们，已由于他们的永远失掉对原子的垄断而大为震惊。
    如果苏联把原子堆提供给各人民民主国家和伟大的中国，那末该怎样办呢！而且还要加上回旋加速器和一切必要的装备。所有原子战争的术士们是要为这件事流泪的。
    而喜好冒险的活动家们曾经多么希望日内瓦四国政府首脑会议一事无成啊。而当这次会议获得良好结果的时候，这些先生们就大叫，到秋天外长们在这同一个日内瓦开会的时候，“冷战”就会像秋雨一样不可避免地又要越来越大。
    而现在，当这新年前夕，甚至在西方那些远不是进步的人们的家庭里，也很难找到拥护又回到“冷战”中去的人。
    ……节日的莫斯科，正像苏联所有的城市和乡村一样迎接新年，并为在国民经济和国际政治方面都获得巨大的成就而欢欣鼓舞。莫斯科刚刚怀着亲切而热爱的心情迎接了从印度、缅甸和阿富汗长途旅行归来的布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同志。这是一次具有巨大的全世界历史意义的旅行。所有惯于诚实而理智地进行思考的人都把这次旅行看作是和平和友谊的鲜明表现，苏联和平政策的新的辉煌成就，苏维埃国家对外政策中列宁主义原则的胜利。
    印度、缅甸和阿富汗的人民欢迎了苏维埃国家的领导人，他们过去从来没有这样欢迎过任何外宾。这里面包含着我们的生活，我们争取苏维埃国家和各国人民自由和独立的斗争的伟大真理，列宁学说的真理和胜利，苏联和平政策的真理和胜利。
    赫鲁晓夫在回到莫斯科的那一天的大会上讲话的时候曾说道：
    “我们有三亿七千万人口的印度人民以及缅甸和阿富汗人民作我们为世界和平而斗争的同盟者。
    “印度是我们国家的一个很大的好朋友。印度和苏联、中华人民共和国一样，坚定地站在为和平而奋斗的阵地上。
    “正如列宁教导我们的，印度、中国和苏联，这就是不可战胜的力量。”
    在迎接新的一九五六年的时候，苏联人民所以生气勃勃地展望着未来，原因就在这里。他们坚信，和平的力量一定会胜利。他们对国家的伟大计划的成绩，对自己改造自然并把科学、技术、农业提到新高度的伟大工作的成绩充满信心。
    苏联人向世界上所有忠诚的劳动者，所有争取世界和平、反对压迫和非正义的人祝福。他们坚信：和平一定会胜利！
