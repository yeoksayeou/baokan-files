    Communal Life is Progressive, Cultured, and Happy
    He Cheng
    The agricultural production cooperative is a happy big family; it is also a great school. Chapter 10 of the Draft Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives stipulates what "lessons" should be learned in this "great school" and how this "big family" should transform unfortunate people into happy people.
    What are the "lessons" in this "great school"? There are three most important ones: one is politics, one is technology, and one is culture. Some of these "lessons" are learned while sitting in the classroom; however, most are gradually learned in daily life and daily production.
    Raising the Level of Political Consciousness
    Since the members joined the cooperative because they "listen to the Communist Party and take the socialist road," doesn't that mean they already have political consciousness? Why is there still a need for political lessons?
    People who participate in agricultural production cooperatives generally have a relatively high level of political consciousness; however, it cannot be said that simply by joining the cooperative, they have a complete and clear understanding of socialism. Farmers have taken the old road for many years, and suddenly embarking on the new road of cooperatives often feels awkward at first. "The land you cultivate for three years is as dear as your mother," and entrusting the land that has been cultivated by your family for generations to the cooperative for unified use inevitably causes some unease. Some people are unwilling to work hard and only want to live off the rewards of land, livestock, and farm tools. Some cooperatives do not focus on managing agriculture but only want to do things that are "lucrative" and "earn easy money," to the point of engaging in speculative business. Some cooperatives divide all the income among the members without accumulating public property; they even conceal yields and do not sell or sell less grain and cotton than they should to the state, and so on. All these situations illustrate that some people, although their bodies have joined the cooperative, are still ideologically linked to capitalism, and they will go astray if influenced by external capitalist ideas. If this kind of thinking becomes a malignant sore on some members, it will affect the health of the entire cooperative, and if it develops further, it will ruin the entire cooperative.
    The current elementary cooperatives are to gradually transition to advanced cooperatives; how can the members transition to advanced cooperatives if they do not raise their political consciousness?
    The Draft Model Regulations stipulate that it is necessary to "explain current domestic and international affairs to the members, publicize the propositions of the Communist Party and the policies of the People's Government, with particular emphasis on publicizing the path of socialist transformation of agriculture and various rural work policies, calling on members to love the motherland, abide by state laws, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and build socialism." Doing so is to enable members to understand the general trend of the world, see clearly which direction the entire society is moving, recognize why socialism is better than capitalism, recognize how reasonable the policies stipulated by the Party and the government are, recognize the benefits of socialist industrialization for the country and the farmers, and actively support the working class in carrying out industrial construction.
    People who participate in agricultural cooperatives generally have collectivist ideas. However, it cannot be said that simply by joining the cooperative, they have completely and clearly understood the relationship between individual interests and collective interests. Farmers have lived in scattered households for generations, and now they have just entered the "big family" of the cooperative. Labor is uniformly allocated by the cooperative, and work must also abide by labor discipline, which not only feels unfamiliar but also causes concern that collective interests will not guarantee individual interests. Therefore, some treat the cooperative with the attitude of "being a hired hand," working sloppily, only seeking to "earn points," regardless of quality; or doing it when they want to and resting when they want to; they also do not cherish the cooperative's public property, thinking that "the loss is not much when divided among my share." Some know that the cooperative has difficulties but are unwilling to invest in the cooperative, instead finding excuses to withdraw more money from the cooperative, always wanting to take advantage of the public. Some cooperatives are jealous of other production groups, and some production teams exclude other production teams; middle peasants look down on poor peasants, and poor peasants do not unite with middle peasants. Some members do not pay attention to uniting with farmers outside the cooperative but instead ridicule and attack them. All these situations illustrate that although some people have joined the collective production organization, it is impossible to eliminate individualistic thinking all at once.
    Therefore, the Draft Model Regulations stipulate that it is necessary to conduct collectivist education for the members, strengthen the unity among all members, between production teams, between cooperatives, and between cooperatives and laboring farmers outside the cooperative, and advocate mutual assistance and mutual aid among members in life. It also stipulates that it is necessary to advocate cherishing the cooperative, cherishing public property, diligence and thrift, and careful calculation; and it is also necessary to educate members to consciously abide by labor discipline. As the saying goes, "If the big river has no water, the small canals will dry up." If only individual interests are considered, only the interests of a small number of people are considered, and collective interests are harmed, then the loss will outweigh the gain. If the cooperative is not run well, where will the members' personal lives be improved from? Socialism is about everyone becoming rich and progressing together; if only a part of the people form a collective, while others are still scattered, how can a socialist society be realized?
    Some farmers are always afraid that after joining the cooperative, they will "have to listen to others in everything"; some farmers only care about working and earning work points after joining the cooperative and are unwilling to manage anything else; and some leaders of cooperatives only believe in themselves, not in the masses, and do not consult with everyone when doing things. How can everyone's abilities be brought into play to run the cooperative well? Therefore, the Draft Model Regulations stipulate that it is necessary to "promote democracy within the cooperative and encourage members to actively participate in the management of cooperative affairs." In this way, collective strength can be used to improve the work of the cooperative and constantly struggle against phenomena that harm the collective interests of the cooperative.
    The Draft Model Regulations also stipulate that it is necessary to "raise the revolutionary vigilance of the members and strengthen the security work of the cooperative." This is because our cooperatives are developing rapidly, and the socialist cause is advancing swiftly; this is carrying out the socialist revolution. The socialist revolution is to eliminate all exploitation. Therefore, the exploiting classes are bound to collude to sabotage our socialist cause. Their main target for sabotage activities in rural areas is the agricultural production cooperative. They set fire to or steal the cooperative's crops, secretly harm the cooperative's livestock, destroy the cooperative's farm tools, or infiltrate the cooperative to seize leadership. We must not be paralyzed!
    Improving Technical and Cultural Level
    The members of the agricultural cooperative are all farmers, so don't they already know how to grow crops? Why is it still necessary to learn technology? It should be known that relying solely on the technology from the past when operating individually is no longer sufficient. Cooperatives must continuously increase production, so they must continuously improve technology and learn new technologies. In the past, when operating individually, it was also difficult to learn new technologies. In the cooperative, everyone can study together and learn from each other, and it is also convenient for comrades from the technology promotion station to come and help; with unified land use and sufficient financial and material resources, it is also easy to conduct experiments. What great conditions for learning and improving technology! Everyone should make good use of these conditions.
    The Draft Model Regulations stipulate that agricultural production cooperatives should carry out labor competitions. What is a labor competition? Is it to compare and see who does more work? The amount of work done, of course, needs to be compared; more importantly, it is to compare technology, to see who can study and improve production technology, who can work more, faster, and better, and who can help the cooperative grow more grain and increase income. Then, will everyone compete to use the best draft animals and farm tools, compete to plant the best and closest land, and will whoever comes up with a good way to improve technology not tell others, only caring about winning for themselves? It cannot be like that. That is not a competition; it becomes selfish and self-interested competition. The competition should not only be about who does well but also about who can best help everyone advance together. In the process of the competition, it is necessary to use the ideas, advanced labor attitudes, and new inventions of the constantly emerging advanced figures to educate the members, and constantly overcome individualism, departmentalism, and conservative thinking. From this point of view, labor competition is both a political lesson and a technical lesson; it can closely combine politics and technology.
    To learn politics and technology well, and to keep records and calculate accounts well, it is always difficult without a certain level of culture. In the future, cooperatives will use machines and electricity, which is even more impossible without a certain level of culture. Therefore, the Draft Model Regulations stipulate that agricultural cooperatives should actively mobilize, organize, and help members to learn to read, study culture and science; they should also carry out cultural, recreational, and sports activities. All these are to improve the cultural life of the members and gradually transform all the laboring farmers into educated people.
    Developing Public Welfare Undertakings
    Some farmers often have this concern: when working individually, they can work at their own pace, doing as much as they can; after joining the cooperative, they are afraid that the work will be too intense, and they will not be able to "handle it." Some are also afraid that when the land is collectivized in the future, they will have no support when they are old and unable to work. In fact, it is just the opposite. When working individually, regardless of big or small jobs, light or heavy jobs, and regardless of whether you can do it or not, you have to do it all yourself. Once an unfortunate accident occurs, each household cannot take care of each other and can only embark on the path of poverty and bankruptcy. When old and frail, life is even more insecure. What is it like in the cooperative? As long as you participate in this collectivist big family, the relationship between people, between the cooperative and the members, is completely different. The relationship between members is equal; they care for each other and love each other. The cooperative is fully responsible for each member. A difficulty for one member is seen by everyone as a difficulty for the cooperative, as their own difficulty. An misfortune for one member is seen by everyone as a misfortune for the cooperative, as their own misfortune. The provisions on member welfare in the Draft Model Regulations fully demonstrate this socialist and collectivist spirit.
    The Draft Model Regulations stipulate that cooperatives must pay attention to the safety of members in labor. When assigning labor tasks, the physical condition of the members must be taken into account. If a member is injured on duty, the cooperative should help with medical treatment; in the event of a death on duty, the cooperative should provide compensation to his family. How can these things be done if not in the cooperative?
    The Draft Model Regulations also stipulate that cooperatives should gradually develop various welfare undertakings with the development of production: carry out public health work and member family hygiene work to protect everyone's health; organize nurseries during busy farming seasons to reduce the burden of housework for female members; and provide appropriate assistance when female members give birth and when members encounter unfortunate accidents or experience serious difficulties in life.
    Only when the cooperative develops more and becomes larger, and the production level in the cooperative is raised higher, can these cultural and welfare undertakings be developed more and more universally. Establishing one more agricultural production cooperative is adding one more happy big family; the more production members add to the agricultural production cooperative, the more they add to socialism, which also means adding more happiness for themselves. Members, participate better in collective labor and build your big family even more beautifully! Farmers who have not yet joined the cooperative, you are welcome to join this big family!

    社内生活是进步的有文化的幸福生活
    何成
    农业生产合作社是个幸福的大家庭；也是个大学校。在农业生产合作社示范章程草案第十章里，就规定了在这个“大学校”里要学些什么“功课”，这个“大家庭”要怎样把不幸的人都变成幸福的人。
    这个“大学校”里有些什么“功课”呢？最重要的有三门：一门是政治课，一门是技术课，一门是文化课。这些“功课”有些也是坐在教室里学；可是，主要的还是在日常生活、日常生产中间，渐渐地就学到了。
    提高政治觉悟的程度
    社员既然是“听共产党的话，走社会主义的路”才加入了合作社，这不就是有了政治觉悟吗？为什么还要有政治课呢？
    参加了农业生产合作社的人，政治觉悟一般地说是比较高的；可是决不能说只要入了社，对社会主义就完全认识清楚了。农民走了多少年的旧道路，一下子走上合作社这条新道路，开头走起来常常觉着不顺当。“地种三年亲似娘”，把自己家里种了几辈子的土地交给社里统一使用，难免有些不放心。有些人不愿好好劳动，光想靠提高土地、牲口、农具的报酬过日子。有的合作社不是以经营农业为主，光想做“油水大”“能赚轻巧钱”的事情，以至发展到做投机生意。有的合作社把收益给社员分光，不积累公共财产；甚至隐瞒产量，不卖或者少卖应该卖给国家的粮食、棉花，等等。这些情况都说明了，有些人虽然身子入了社，思想上还跟资本主义挂着钩，受到外界资本主义思想的影响就会走到歪路上去。这种思想如果在一部分社员身上成了毒疮，就会影响到整个合作社的健康，发展下去，还会把整个合作社弄烂。
    目前的初级合作社是要逐步向高级合作社过渡的；社员不提高政治觉悟，怎样能过渡到高级社呢？
    示范章程草案规定，要“向社员讲解国内外时事，宣传共产党的主张和人民政府的政策，特别着重宣传农业社会主义改造的道路和各种农村工作的政策，号召社员热爱祖国，遵守国家法律，巩固工农联盟，建设社会主义。”这样做，是为了使社员了解世界大势，看清整个社会正在朝着哪个方向走，认清为什么社会主义比资本主义好，认清党和政府规定的政策是多么合情合理，认清社会主义工业化对国家对农民的好处，积极支援工人阶级进行工业建设。
    参加了农业合作社的人，一般地说是有集体主义思想的。可是，也决不能说，只要入了社，就已经把个人利益和集体利益的关系完全认识清楚了。农民一家一户分散生产过了多少辈子，现在刚刚走进合作社这个“大家庭”，劳动力由社里统一调配，干活也要遵守劳动纪律，不仅会感到不习惯，也会担心集体利益保障不了个人的利益。因此，有的是拿“当长工”的态度对待合作社，干起活来马马虎虎，只求多“挣分”，不顾质量；或者想做就做，想歇就歇；对合作社的公共财产也不加爱护，认为“损失点分到我名下没多少”。有的明知社里有困难，也不肯向社里投资，反而找因由向社里多支钱，处处想占公家的便宜。有的合作社这个生产组嫉妒那个生产组，这个生产队排斥那个生产队；中农看不起贫农，贫农不团结中农。有些社员不注意团结社外农民，反而对社外农民讽刺和打击。这些情况都说明了，有些人虽然加入了集体的生产组织，但是个人主义思想还不可能一下子去掉。
    因此，示范章程草案规定，要向社员进行集体主义的教育，加强全体社员之间、生产队同生产队之间、合作社同合作社之间、合作社同社外劳动农民之间的团结，提倡社员在生活上互助互济。并且规定：要提倡爱护合作社，爱护公共财产，勤俭节约，精打细算；还要教育社员自觉地遵守劳动纪律。俗语说：“大河没水小渠干”，如果只顾个人利益，只顾一小部分人的利益，损害了集体利益，那就会因小失大。合作社办不好，社员的个人生活从哪里改善呢？社会主义就是大家共同富裕、共同进步；如果光是一部分人合成集体了，而别的人却还分散着，社会主义社会怎么能实现呢？
    有些农民总怕入了社以后“什么都得听人家管”；有些农民入社以后只管干活挣工分，别的什么也不愿意管；也有一些合作社的领导人员光相信自己，不相信群众，办事不和大家商量。这样，怎能把大家的本事都使出来把合作社办好呢？因此，示范章程草案规定：要“发扬合作社内的民主，鼓励社员积极地参加社务管理”。这样，就可以用集体力量来改进合作社的工作，不断地同损害合作社的集体利益的现象进行斗争。
    示范章程草案上还规定要“提高社员的革命警惕性，加强合作社的保卫工作”。这是因为我们的合作社正在大量发展，社会主义事业在飞快地前进；这就是在进行社会主义革命。社会主义革命是要消灭一切剥削的。因此，剥削阶级势必要勾结起来破坏我们的社会主义事业。他们在农村进行破坏活动的主要目标就是农业生产合作社。他们放火烧或者偷盗社里的庄稼，暗害社里的牲口，毁坏社里的农具，或者钻到社里夺取领导权。我们千万不能麻痹！
    提高技术和文化水平
    农业合作社的社员都是庄稼人，难道还不会种庄稼？为什么还要学技术呢？要知道，光靠过去分散经营的时候那些技术已经不够用了。合作社要不断增加生产，非不断提高技术不可，非学习新的技术不可。过去分散经营的时候，想要学新技术，也很困难。在社里，大家可以一起研究，互相学习，技术推广站的同志来帮助也方便；土地统一使用了，财力物力充足了，也便于进行试验，这是学习技术、提高技术的多么好的条件！大家应该好好地利用这些条件。
    示范章程草案规定，农业生产合作社要开展劳动竞赛，什么是劳动竞赛呢？是不是比一比看谁做活多？做活的多少，当然要比；更重要的是比技术，看谁能钻研和改进生产技术，谁能干活干得又多又快又好，谁能叫社里多打粮食，增加收入。那么，会不会大家都要争用最好的耕畜、农具，争种最好最近的地，谁想出了改进技术的好办法也不告诉别人，只顾自己比赢呢？不能那样。那样就不是竞赛，就成了自私自利的竞争了。竞赛不光要比谁干得好，还要看谁最能帮助大家一同前进。在竞赛过程中，要用不断出现的先进人物的思想、先进的劳动态度和新的创造发明教育社员，不断地克服个人主义、本位主义和保守思想。这样看来，劳动竞赛既是政治课，又是技术课，它能把政治和技术密切结合起来。
    要很好地学政治、学技术，要很好地记工算账，没有一定的文化水平总是很困难。将来合作社要用机器、用电力，没有一定的文化水平更不行。因此示范章程草案规定：农业合作社应该积极地动员、组织和帮助社员认字、学习文化和科学；还应该开展文化、娱乐和体育活动。这些都是为了提高社员的文化生活水平，渐渐地把全体劳动农民都变成有学问的人。
    发展公共福利事业
    有些农民往往还有这样一种顾虑：单干的时候，给自己干活，可以量力而行，能干多少就干多少；入了社，怕干起活来太紧张，“吃不消”。有人还怕将来土地公有化了，自己老了不能干活的时候没依靠。其实，正相反。单干的时候，不论大活、小活、轻活、重活，也不管你干的了干不了，横竖全要自己干。一旦遭到不幸事故，各家各户谁也顾不了谁，只能走上贫困破产的道路。到了年老力衰的时候，生活就更没保障了。在合作社里是什么样子呢？只要参加了这个集体主义的大家庭，人和人的关系、社和社员的关系就完全不同了。社员和社员的关系是平等的，是互相关心、互相爱护的。合作社对每个社员是完全负责的。一个社员有了困难，大家都看做是合作社的困难，是自己的困难。一个社员遭到不幸，大家也看做是合作社的不幸，是自己的不幸。示范章程草案上关于社员福利的规定，就充分表现了这种社会主义、集体主义的精神。
    示范章程草案规定，合作社必须注意社员在劳动中的安全。在分配劳动任务的时候，要照顾到社员的身体状况。如果社员因公负伤了，合作社要帮助医治；万一因公牺牲了，合作社要抚恤他的家属。这些事情，如果不是在合作社里，怎能办得到呢？
    示范章程草案还规定，合作社应该随着生产的发展，逐步地发展各种福利事业：开展公共卫生工作和社员家庭卫生工作，保护大家的身体健康；组织农忙托儿所，减轻女社员的家务担负；在女社员生孩子的时候和社员遭到不幸事故、生活发生严重困难的时候，都酌量给以帮助。
    只有合作社发展得更多更大了，社里的生产水平提得更高了，这些文化福利事业才能更多、更普遍地发展。多办一个农业生产合作社，就是增加了一个幸福的大家庭；社员为农业生产合作社多增加一份生产，就是为社会主义多增添一份力量，也就是为自己多增添一份幸福。社员们，更好地参加集体劳动，把自己的大家庭建设得更加美好吧！还没有入社的农民们，欢迎你们参加到这个大家庭里来！
