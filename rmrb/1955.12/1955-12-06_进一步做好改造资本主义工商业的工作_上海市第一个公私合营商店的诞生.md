    Further Improve the Work of Transforming Capitalist Industry and Commerce
    The Birth of Shanghai's First Joint State-Private Store
    By Our Correspondent Ji Yin
    On the morning of November 16th, the Shanghai Joint State-Private Songshan District Woolen Yarn Store opened for business amidst the sounds of firecrackers and gongs and drums. Teams from various districts came to offer their congratulations, and customers arrived in an endless stream. This woolen yarn store with five outlets is the first joint state-private store in Shanghai. The birth of this new type of store is a new development in the socialist transformation of private commerce in Shanghai.
    The Shanghai Joint State-Private Songshan District Woolen Yarn Store was formed by the merger of all private woolen yarn stores in Songshan District. In this socialist transformation, the nine woolen yarn stores in the district not only underwent merger and reorganization but also rose from the lower form of state capitalism – distribution outlets – to the higher form of joint state-private ownership. This transformation has enabled these stores to better serve consumers and has fundamentally changed the extremely difficult situation faced by these private stores due to their backwardness.
    The nine private woolen yarn stores in Shanghai's Songshan District, like the entire woolen yarn industry in Shanghai, developed on the basis of the false prosperity of the Shanghai market before liberation. In the past, because woolen yarn was expensive, varieties were simple, profits were high, and no special skills were required to operate, it was very convenient for capitalists to engage in speculative activities. Many speculators placed their bets on this card, and stores developed blindly, one after another. These blindly developed woolen yarn stores faced increasingly difficult circumstances in the years after liberation. In the third quarter of 1953, the Shanghai State-Owned Department Store completely controlled the supply of woolen yarn, unified the listed prices, and rationally limited the profits of private woolen yarn stores, cracking down on speculation and deception. This further exposed the backwardness of these enterprises. On the one hand, improper income from the past was lost, while the various unreasonable and huge expenses of the enterprises remained unchanged. As a result, the nine private woolen yarn stores were in a state of deficit. In the fourth quarter of last year, while arranging and transforming various private retailers in Shanghai, the state also made arrangements and transformations for private woolen yarn commerce. State-owned companies established distribution relationships with the entire woolen yarn industry, incorporating their business plans into the state plan, making these stores distribution outlets in the form of state capitalism. After this initial transformation, the business situation improved somewhat, and some changes began to take place within the enterprises. However, this change was very small because distribution outlets are, after all, a relatively low form of state capitalism. It is impossible to resolve the many fundamental contradictions arising from the capitalist ownership system, and therefore, the difficult problems of the enterprises cannot be completely resolved. These contradictions mainly are:
    1.  The irrational state of the old commercial network is not adapted to the new situation after the implementation of distribution. In the past, the distribution of these woolen yarn stores was either to facilitate speculative activities or to cater to the urban bourgeoisie as the main consumers. Therefore, they all chose prosperous roads with convenient transportation and access to information. All nine of these woolen yarn stores are concentrated in the bustling area north of Xujiahui Road in Songshan District, with five of them even more concentrated on Jinling East Road, while the vast area south of Xujiahui Road, accounting for more than half of the district, does not have a single store. In recent years, our country's life has changed, and the area south of Xujiahui Road has increasingly expanded into an industrial area. The working people have become the main customers of woolen yarn stores. On the first day of the opening of the joint state-private woolen yarn store, the first customer who came in and bought four pounds of woolen yarn was an employee of a medical equipment factory. However, the irrational commercial network lost this group of customers with great purchasing power.
    2.  Although the distribution outlets have been initially incorporated into the state plan in terms of operation, the business management and organizational structure of the enterprises are still capitalist. The nine woolen yarn stores have serious problems with backward management, overstaffing, and huge expenses. For example, the Shunli Woolen Yarn Store, with only a half-room shop front, has six employees, and the Tongtaichang Woolen Yarn Store has nineteen employees. Even during the best times of business, only half of the staff would be sufficient. Also, the cost of meals is as high as 27 yuan per person per month (the general meal cost for Shanghai shop assistants is only about 15 yuan per month), and the wage system is also very unreasonable. The profit income from distribution is, of course, not balanced with such huge expenses, resulting in losses.
    3.  These lower forms of state capitalist enterprises have restricted the enthusiasm of employees due to the failure to change the relations of production. In addition, the enterprises' management is corrupt, and losses are becoming more and more serious, and the work and lives of employees are not guaranteed. In recent years, almost none of the nine woolen yarn stores have avoided labor-capital disputes. At the same time, because no state representatives directly participate in the leadership of the enterprises, not only is the transformation of the enterprises very difficult, but the ideological transformation of the capitalists is also not very effective.
    Due to the existence of the above contradictions, although these nine woolen yarn stores have implemented distribution, the difficulties remain serious. Eight of the nine are still constantly losing money. Among them, the Tongtaichang Woolen Yarn Store, which has more employees, and the Xiej Woolen Yarn Store, which is the smallest in scale, cannot even achieve a balance of income and expenditure even during the peak seasons of autumn and winter. One of them has capital and liabilities that are equal. This means that these nine private enterprises can no longer operate in the old way, and they must find a way out.
    In May of this year, the state helped Songshan District adjust its retail network for cotton, department stores, and coal, and some stores merged and operated together, which improved their business. The nine woolen yarn stores decided to use this private-private merger method to find a way out, and the capitalists drafted a huge merger plan. However, the employees were not enthusiastic about the private-private merger, and there were also contradictions between the capitalists (the capitalists of the woolen yarn stores with surpluses resolutely refused to participate). Because the private-private merger only achieved unified operation from decentralized operation in form, the nature of the enterprise did not change, and many major problems could not be solved by the capitalists' own abilities, such as improving business management and solving many unreasonable systems, and even the 39 employees could not be managed in a unified manner. The capitalists also had self-awareness. When recommending candidates for managers, no one was willing to take on this position, which would inevitably have countless troubles in the future. Finally, they pushed a capitalist of the smallest woolen yarn store with only 500 yuan of capital to fill this role. After several months of private-private merger, it was finally declared a failure. At this time, the state, through the Songshan District Federation of Industry and Commerce, pointed out to the woolen yarn industry capitalists that the only way to reasonably solve the problems of the woolen yarn industry was to implement joint state-private ownership on the basis of merger and obtain direct leadership from the state. This enlightenment from the state pointed out a way out for the capitalists, and everyone was overjoyed. They described their mood at the time as "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way out, suddenly there is a bright future." Therefore, the capitalists of the nine woolen yarn stores jointly applied for joint operation at the end of October and were approved by the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee.
    Under the leadership of state representatives, the nine woolen yarn stores adopted a fully consultative approach and smoothly resolved issues such as asset inventory, personnel arrangements, and organizational adjustments in the joint operation and decided to adopt a fixed-interest rate method for profit distribution in the future. Most of these stores were in a state of unbearable losses and had no dividends to distribute at all. The implementation of the fixed-interest rate method allowed them to obtain a certain profit, so they all expressed their agreement. In the organizational adjustment, the management structure was appropriately streamlined, and the nine stores were merged into five, and the retail network was rationally adjusted. The five stores concentrated on Jinling East Road were reduced to two, and the rest were distributed to residential areas of the working people. All of the capitalists' actual positions were rationally arranged for work, and four more employees were promoted to serve as directors and deputy directors of branch stores, strengthening the employee component in the leadership. The labor force of each store was also rationally allocated in a unified manner.
    In the process of joint operation, all relevant parties conducted sincere ideological education for the capitalist representatives to dispel their various concerns. One of the woolen yarn stores had a better business in the past, and the capitalist was initially unwilling to participate in the joint state-private operation. The first time he was invited to participate in a forum, he felt that it had nothing to do with him and asked for leave to withdraw in the middle of the meeting. During the second forum, he gradually felt that the joint state-private operation method discussed at the meeting was very good. If he did not participate in the joint state-private operation, it would be difficult for him to maintain the past business situation in the future. He listened until the end of the meeting. Halfway through the third forum, he stood up to speak, requesting to participate in the joint state-private operation. Under this kind of ideological education, several capitalists made self-criticisms, and everyone expressed that they would transform themselves well in the future. The capitalist of Tianbao Woolen Yarn Store reviewed the past labor-capital relations and voluntarily took out 3,000 yuan in cash to join the new enterprise as shares.
    The implementation of joint state-private operation also caused changes in the thinking of employees. Two employees of Tongtaichang Woolen Yarn Store had been quarreling for a long time and had not spoken to each other for half a year. At the group meeting to discuss the joint state-private operation, the two finally excitedly made self-criticisms to each other, saying that they must unite and do a good job in the new work in the future. Many employees said that they would strengthen labor discipline and improve service attitudes in the future. Before the implementation of joint state-private operation, they went to Shanghai's No. 1 Department Store in groups to learn new sales methods. After changing the relations of production, the mental state of these employees was completely new. The joint state-private woolen yarn store officially started business on November 16. In the past week, the average daily turnover has increased by about 100% compared to before the implementation of joint state-private operation.
    The formation of the Shanghai Joint State-Private Songshan District Woolen Yarn Store has created some preliminary experience for how state capitalist commerce can develop from a lower form to a higher form. It shows that joint state-private operation is not only the main form of transforming private industry at present, but it is also effective in transforming private commerce as long as certain conditions are met. The implementation of this joint state-private operation should also be carried out in accordance with the principle of "overall planning and comprehensive arrangement," while also carrying out necessary mergers and reorganizations. The merger and reorganization of the woolen yarn stores in Songshan District was only carried out within the scope of one district. On November 18, following the woolen yarn stores in Songshan District, more than 100 woolen yarn retail stores in Shanghai City were approved to implement joint state-private operation throughout the industry. In this way, private woolen yarn retailers in Shanghai can be rationally arranged within the city, and the transformation work can be done more deeply, more rationally, and it must be more effective.

    进一步做好改造资本主义工商业的工作
    上海市第一个公私合营商店的诞生
    本报记者　季音
    十一月十六日清晨，上海公私合营嵩山区绒线商店在一片爆竹、锣鼓声中开始了营业，从各区赶来了道喜的队伍和陆续不绝的顾客们。这个设有五个门市部的绒线商店是上海市第一个公私合营商店。这个新型商店的诞生，是上海私营商业社会主义改造事业上的一个新发展。
    上海市公私合营嵩山区绒线商店，是由嵩山区全部私营绒线商店合并组成的。在这次社会主义改造中，全区的九家绒线商店一方面实行了合并改组，同时又由过去国家资本主义的低级形式——经销店，上升到公私合营的高级形式。通过这次改造，使这些商店既能更好地为消费者服务，也从根本上改变了这些私营商店由于落后而产生的极度困难的局面。
    上海嵩山区的九家私营绒线商店，它如同上海整个的绒线行业一样，是在解放前上海市场虚假繁荣的基础上发展起来的。过去因为绒线价格高，品种简单，利润大，又不必具有特殊技术就可经营，十分便于资本家从事投机活动，不少投机商便把赌注掷到了这张牌上，商店一家家地盲目发展了起来。这些盲目发展起来的绒线店，在解放后的几年中，处境一天比一天困难。一九五三年第三季度，上海国营百货公司完全掌握了绒线货源，统一了牌价，给私营绒线店的利润作了合理的限制，打击了投机、欺骗行为，这些企业的落后性就更加暴露无遗。一方面是过去的不正当收入丧失了，而企业各种不合理的庞大开支却依然如故，结果九家私营绒线店便处于入不敷出的亏损状况。去年第四季度，国家在安排、改造上海各种私营零售商的同时，也对私营绒线商业作了安排和改造，国营公司同绒线业全行业建立了经销关系，把它们的经营计划纳入了国家计划，使这些商店成了国家资本主义形式的经销商店。经过这个初步的改造，营业情况有了些好转，企业内部也开始起了些变化。但是这个变化是很微小的，因为经销店毕竟是比较低级形式的国家资本主义，它不可能解决那些在资本主义所有制基础上产生的许多根本矛盾，因此企业的困难问题也就不可能完全解决。这些矛盾主要是：
    一、实行经销后，旧有商业网的不合理状况同新情况不相适应。过去这些绒线店的分布有的是为了便于投机活动，有的是以城市资产阶级为主要消费对象，因此都选择了交通便利、消息灵通的繁华要道。这九家绒线店，全部集中在嵩山区徐家汇路以北的闹市，其中又有五家更集中在金陵东路一条路上，而徐家汇路以南、占全区一半以上的广大地区，却一家店也没有。几年来，我们国家的生活已经发生了变化，徐家汇路以南已经日益扩展成为工业区，劳动人民已经成为绒线店的主要顾客，这次公私合营绒线店开业的第一天，第一个进来买了四斤绒线的主顾，就是一家医疗器械厂的职工。但是不合理的商业网，丢掉了这批购买力很大的顾客。
    二、经销店虽然在经营上初步纳入了国家计划，但是企业的经营管理、组织机构仍然是资本主义的一套。这九家绒线店管理落后、人员过剩、开支浩大的情况是很严重的，如只有半开间店面的顺利绒线店有职工六人，同泰昌绒线店有职工十九人，即使在买卖最好的时候，也只要一半人就够了。又如伙食的开支，最高的每人每月达二十七元（上海店员伙食一般一个月只要十五元左右），工资制度也很不合理。经销的利润收入同这种浩大的开支当然不能平衡，结果只好亏损。
    三、这些低级形式的国家资本主义企业，由于生产关系未能改变，职工的劳动积极性受到了束缚，又加企业经营腐败，亏损一天天严重，职工的工作和生活没有保障。这九家绒线店近年中几乎没有一家不闹劳资纠纷的。同时，因为没有国家代表直接参加企业的领导，不但企业的改造很困难，资本家的思想改造也收效不大。
    由于上述这些矛盾的存在，这九家绒线店虽然实行了经销，困难依然严重。九家有八家还是不断亏损，其中如从业人员较多的同泰昌绒线店和规模最小的协记绒线店，即使在营业最旺的秋冬季节，也不能达到收支平衡，有一家资金和负债额已经相等。这就是说，这九家私营企业事实上已经不可能再按照旧方式经营下去了，他们必须找到一条出路。
    今年五月间，国家帮助嵩山区的棉布、百货、煤薪炭等行业调整了零售网，有的商店进行了合并经营，营业有了好转，这九家绒线店便决定采用这个私私合并办法来找出路，资本家们拟出了一个机构庞大的合并方案。但是职工对私私合并情绪不高，资本家间也有矛盾（有盈余的绒线店资方就坚决不肯参加）。因为私私合并不过只是形式上由分散经营做到了统一经营，企业性质并没有改变，许多重大问题仍非资本家的能力所能解决，如改善经营管理、解决许多不合理的制度等，甚至对三十九个职工，也无法统一管理。资本家们也有自知之明，在推举经理人选的时候，谁都不愿意来担任这个日后必有无数麻烦的职务，最后就推了一家只有五百元资金的、最小的绒线店资方来充任这个角色。私私合并了几个月，最后还是宣告流产。这时候，国家通过嵩山区的工商联向绒线业资本家们指出：要合理解决绒线业的问题，只有在合并的基础上实行公私合营，取得国家的直接领导。国家的这个启示，给资本家们指明了一条出路，真是人人喜出望外，他们形容当时的心情是“山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”。于是九家绒线店资方就在十月底联名提出申请合营，并得到了上海市人民委员会的批准。
    九家绒线店在公股代表领导下，采取充分协商办法，顺利地解决了合营中的清产核资、人事安排、机构调整等问题，并且决定今后利润分配采取定股定息办法。这些店过去大部分是亏累不堪，根本没有红利可分，实行定息办法后，使他们有一定利润可得，因而都表示同意。机构调整中适当地精简了管理机构，把九户并成五户，重新合理调整了零售网，把集中在金陵东路上的五户减为二户，其余都分布到劳动人民居住区。资方实职人员全部合理安排了工作，另外又提拔了四个职工担任分店的正、副主任，加强了领导中的职工成份。各店的劳动力也统一作了合理分配。
    在合营过程中，各有关方面对资方代表进行了诚恳的思想教育，解除他们的各种疑虑。其中有一个绒线店过去营业较好，资方最初不肯参加公私合营。第一次请他参加座谈会，他觉得同他无关，会开到中途就请假退出了。第二次座谈的时候，他渐渐觉得会上所谈的公私合营办法很好，他不参加公私合营，今后也很难再维持过去的营业状况。就一直听到散会。第三次座谈会开到一半，他就起来发言，要求参加公私合营。在这种思想教育下，好几个资本家作了自我检讨，大家都表示今后要好好改造自己。天宝绒线店资方检讨了过去的劳资关系，并自动拿出了现金三千元，作为股金加入新企业。
    实行公私合营在职工思想上也引起了变化。同泰昌绒线店有二个职工长期闹架，已经有半年相互不说话了，在讨论公私合营工作的小组会上，两人终于激动地相互作了检讨，表示今后一定要团结一致，做好新工作。许多职工表示今后要加强劳动纪律，改善服务态度。实行公私合营前他们成群地赶到上海第一百货公司，去学习新的销售方法。改变了生产关系之后，使这些职工的精神状态为之一新。公私合营绒线商店已经在十一月十六日正式开始营业，一星期来，每天平均营业额要比实行公私合营前增加一倍左右。
    上海公私合营嵩山区绒线商店的组成，为国家资本主义商业如何由低级形式发展到高级形式创造了一些初步的经验，它说明了公私合营不仅是目前改造私营工业的主要形式，只要具备了一定的条件，在改造私营商业方面同样是有效的。实行这种公私合营也应当根据“统筹兼顾、全面安排”的方针，同时进行必要的合并和改组。嵩山区绒线店的合并改组还只是在一个区的范围内进行的。十一月十八日，上海全市一百多家绒线零售店，继嵩山区绒线店之后，已经被批准实行全行业公私合营，这样，上海的私营绒线零售商就可以在全市范围内进行合理的安排，改造工作也就可以做得更深入，更合理，也一定更有成效。
