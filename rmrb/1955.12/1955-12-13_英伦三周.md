    Three Weeks in England
    Zhao Feng, Deputy Head of the Chinese Art Troupe

    On the day the Chinese Art Troupe arrived in London, the train was delayed by nearly three hours, but still several hundred people crowded the platform to welcome us. Although we had experienced what was said to be the biggest storm in the English Channel in ten years, leaving everyone somewhat tired, we were immediately moved and encouraged by the enthusiasm of the British public and overseas Chinese, forgetting the fatigue of the journey.

    Many touching examples expressed the British people's friendly wishes toward the Chinese people. When we arrived at the hotel, we immediately discovered that there was fruit in everyone's room. Later we learned that this was a gift from a female missionary who had just returned from China, and that she herself had gone to the market early in the morning to select it. During the three weeks of our performances in London, we received many congratulatory and thank-you letters, some with exquisite gifts. Among the letter writers were a principal of a public school in northern England, a prominent women's leader, a real estate businessman, dozens of people jointly signing, and teenage drama enthusiasts… They either requested us to perform in other places, or asked us to extend the performance dates, or gave our performances high praise and commendation. Among the many audience members who could not buy tickets, one wrote to ask if we would be performing in other cities, saying he would rush to any place to make up for his regret.

    The Chinese Art Troupe performed in London for three weeks, but by the beginning of the second week, all the tickets had been sold out; the theater had to sell standing-room tickets. Hundreds of people lined up every morning to buy tickets, some waiting until noon. The Britain-China Friendship Association received hundreds of phone calls every day, all requesting help in purchasing tickets or asking for an extension of the performance period. To thank the British public for their touching enthusiasm, the Chinese Art Troupe performed for forty minutes on the British Broadcasting Corporation's television program. It was a Sunday, and it is said that about fourteen million people watched the television. As soon as the program ended, the broadcasting company received many phone calls; in the following days, they also received many letters praising their organizational work and the beautiful performances of the art troupe.

    Many people requested the Chinese Art Troupe to perform in London for at least six months. Various British newspapers wrote moving descriptions and praise of the art troupe's performances. Some newspapers considered it a major event in cultural life in decades. A famous playwright said that this unique form of expression of Chinese classical drama would influence the writing and performance methods of Western drama in the future.

    The Chinese Art Troupe participated in the annual Royal Variety Performance for the Queen of England, and the Chinese classical drama program received high praise. Many newspapers recognized that the programs of the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble and the Chinese Art Troupe were the most successful of the entire evening.

    The Chinese Art Troupe made friendly contact with the cultural and artistic circles of London. This exchange of friendship between colleagues created an unforgettable and profound impression. More than six hundred teachers and students from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the ballet school attached to Sadler's Wells Theatre, and the Royal Academy of Dance, visited the daily practice of the Chinese Art Troupe's actors and the basic training of Chinese classical drama. They believed that this was a practical and effective method of training actors that they had never seen before. Members of the Chinese Art Troupe also observed the training methods of several dance schools in England, and their high musicality and elegant movements also inspired us a lot. The leaders of the Chinese Art Troupe specially visited Stratford, the hometown of the great sixteenth-century British playwright Shakespeare. The artists of the local Shakespeare Memorial Theatre expressed unlimited goodwill to the Chinese Art Troupe and hoped to have the opportunity to perform for the Chinese public in the future. The Chinese Art Troupe visited the amateur theater jointly organized by workers of various parties in the East End of London. These enthusiastic drama lovers showed endless creativity and adhered to the noble will to educate the people through art. The artists of the Chinese Art Troupe enjoyed with great interest the performances of the Royal Opera House, Sadler's Wells Theatre, and the London Symphony Orchestra, as well as the exquisite collections of the British Museum, the National Gallery, and the Modern Gallery. This valuable artistic experience for the members of the Chinese Art Troupe will help their future artistic creation. We were particularly moved when, on the day we visited the Old Vic Theatre to watch Shakespeare's "The Winter's Tale," the actors, after taking their bows to the audience, announced the presence of the Chinese artists, and the stage and audience immediately erupted in applause and cheers.

    During the three weeks of the Chinese Art Troupe's visit and performance in London, we also established good friendships with the staff of the theaters and hotels. The moral character of the citizens of New China and the simple style of the actors gave them a good impression. They were reluctant to part with the actors of the Chinese Art Troupe, and one of the doormen of the theater was even moved to tears.

    As Mr. Chorley, Chairman of the Britain-China Friendship Association, said, the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe has reached the point of being known to every household. The Britain-China Friendship Association received many letters of thanks, and many people requested to join as members. It is also just as the "Reynolds News" review pointed out: "If you, like me, have been instilled with the idea that the Chinese are an incredible nation, then please take a look at the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe, and your prejudices will all be changed." It is also just as "Everybody's Weekly" said: "The genius artists from Beijing have caused a sensation in all the cities of Europe. We always imagine China as a quiet, gray, solemn place, where sanctimonious philosophers sit by the lotus pond and quote Confucius to each other. This idea should now be discarded." The performance of the Chinese Art Troupe did indeed make many people understand New China; and it did indeed change some past views of China. In the past, the distortions or misunderstandings of New China from various sources, due to the Chinese Art Troupe's performance proving the Chinese people's respect for their own culture and the high development of New China's cultural undertakings, have eliminated these distortions or misunderstandings to a certain extent. The practices and achievements of New China's cultural and artistic work have given many upright and conscientious Western artists a lot of inspiration.

    The actors of the Chinese Art Troupe will never forget the kindness of the ordinary British people towards China and their desire for British-Chinese friendship. A small thing can prove this, that is, we saw that many ordinary British families had collected some Chinese discs or reproductions of Chinese ink paintings. We firmly believe that this appreciation and respect of the British people for Chinese culture is one of the important foundations for promoting further mutual understanding. We wish that this cultural relationship between the people will develop day by day, and we wish that the cultural exchanges between the people of all countries in the world will be strengthened day by day. Only by strengthening this cultural relationship between the people can we eliminate the intentional or unintentional misunderstandings caused in the past, and eliminate those artificial preconceptions and prejudices.

    英伦三周
    中国艺术团副团长　赵沨
    中国艺术团到达伦敦的那一天，火车误点将近三个小时，但是仍然有好几百人拥挤在站台上等着欢迎我们。虽然我们经历了据说是十年以来最大的英伦海峡的风浪，以致每个人都有些疲劳；但是，我们立刻就为英国公众和海外华侨的热情所感动和鼓舞，忘记了旅途劳顿。
    许多令人感动的事例表达了英国人民对中国人民的友好愿望。当我们到达旅馆的时候，立刻发现每个人的房间里都放了水果。后来才知道，这是一位从中国刚刚回去的女传教士送给我们的；并且是她自己在大清早到市场里选购的。我们在伦敦访问演出的三个星期中，曾接到许多祝贺和致谢的信件，有的还附了精美的礼物。写信的人当中有英国北部的一个公立学校校长，有著名的妇女领袖，有地产商人，也有好几十个人共同署名的，也有十几岁的戏剧爱好者，……他们或者要求我们到外地演出，或者要求我们延长演出的日期，或者对我们的演出给予崇高的评价和赞美。在许多买不到入场券的观众中，其中有一位写信问我们到不到别的城市去演出，他说他将赶到任何地方来弥补他的遗憾。
    中国艺术团在伦敦公演了三个星期，但在第二个星期的开始，入场券已经全部卖完了；剧院不得不出售站票。每天清早就有几百人列队等着买票，有些人一直等到中午。英中友好协会每天接到数以百计的电话，都是要求设法购买入场券的，或者要求延长演出期限的。为了答谢英国公众的令人感动的热情，中国艺术团在英国国家广播公司的电视节目中进行了四十分钟的表演。这是一个星期天，据说约有一千四百万人看了电视。节目刚结束，广播公司就接到了许多电话；以后的几天还收到了不少信件，赞美他们的组织工作和艺术团的美丽的表演。
    许多人要求中国艺术团在伦敦至少演出六个月。英国各种报纸都对艺术团演出的节目作了动人的描写和赞美。有些报纸认为这是几十年来文化生活中的重大事件。有一位著名的剧作家说，中国古典戏剧这种独特的表现方式，将会影响今后西方话剧的编剧方法和表现方式。
    中国艺术团参加了每年一度为英国女皇演出的会演大会，中国古典戏剧的节目得到了很高的赞许。许多报纸公认苏联国立民间舞蹈团和中国艺术团的节目是整个晚会中最成功的节目。
    中国艺术团和伦敦的文化艺术界作了友好的接触。这种同行的友情的交流，造成了难忘的深刻的印象。皇家戏剧学院、马鞍井歌舞剧院附设的芭蕾舞学校以及皇家舞蹈学院等一共六百多个师生，参观了中国艺术团演员的日常练习和中国古典戏剧的基本训练。他们认为这是他们从未见过的实用、有效的训练演员的方法。中国艺术团的团员也观摩了英国好几个舞蹈学校的训练方法，他们的高度的音乐性和动作的典雅也使我们得到很多启发。中国艺术团的领导人员特地访问了十六世纪伟大的英国戏剧家莎士比亚的故乡斯特拉福。当地莎士比亚纪念剧院的艺术家们，对中国艺术团表示了无限的好意，并希望将来能够有机会为中国的公众演出。中国艺术团参观了伦敦东区的、各党派的工人联合举办的业余剧院。这些热烈的戏剧爱好者，表现了无尽的创造力，并遵守着以艺术来教育人民的崇高意志。中国艺术团的艺术家们很有兴趣地欣赏了英国皇家歌剧院和马鞍井歌舞剧院以及伦敦交响乐队的演出，还有英国博物馆、国家画廊以及现代画廊的精美收藏。这种对中国艺术团团员们说来是可贵的艺术经历，将有助于他们今后的艺术创造。特别使我们感动的是当我们参观老维克剧院演出莎士比亚的“冬天的故事”的那一天，演员在向观众谢幕以后，宣布了中国艺术家的在座，台上台下立即响起了掌声和欢呼。
    中国艺术团在伦敦访问演出的三个星期中，同剧院、旅馆的工作人员也建立了很好的友谊。新中国的公民的道德风貌和演员的朴实作风，给予他们很好的印象。他们和中国艺术团的演员们分手时都依依不舍，剧院的一位守门者甚至激动得流下泪来。
    正如英中友好协会的主席裘尔斯说的，中国艺术团的演出已经达到了家喻户晓的程度。英中友好协会接到许多致谢的信，还有许多人要求加入为会员。也正像“雷诺新闻”的评论指出的：“如果你也像我一样被人灌输了认为中国人是不可思议的民族的观念的话，那末请你看看中国艺术团的表演，你的成见就会全部改变。”也正像“人人周刊”所说的：“北京来的天才艺人轰动了欧洲所有的城市，我们总把中国想像成一个安静的、灰色的、庄严的所在，道貌岸然的哲学家坐在荷花池边相互引证着孔子的话，这种想法现在应该加以抛弃了。”中国艺术团的演出，的确使很多人认识了新中国；也的确使很多人改变了过去某些对中国的看法。过去，来自各方面的对新中国的歪曲或误解，由于中国艺术团的演出所证明的中国人民对自己的文化的尊重，以及新中国文化事业的高度发展这一事实，使这些歪曲或误解得到了一定的消除。新中国文化艺术工作的作法和成就，使很多正直的、有良心的西方艺术家得到不少启示。
    中国艺术团的演员们，永远忘记不了英国普通人民那种对于中国的好意，和对于英中友好的愿望。有一件小事可以证明这一点，那便是我们在许多普通的英国人家里，看到他们收藏了一些中国的磁盘、或是中国彩墨画的复制品。我们深信，英国人民这种对中国文化的欣赏和尊重，是促使我们进一步相互了解的重要基础之一。我们预祝这种人民之间的文化关系日益发展，预祝世界各国人民之间的文化来往日益加强。只有加强这种人民之间的文化关系，才能消除过去所造成的有意无意的误解，消除那些人为的成见和偏见。
