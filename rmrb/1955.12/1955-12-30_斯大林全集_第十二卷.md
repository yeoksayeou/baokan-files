    "The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume XII
    Yi Huiqun
    "The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume XII, includes Stalin's works from April 1929 to June 1930. During this period, socialist construction in the Soviet Union was surging forward, and the Soviet Union had already made significant achievements in socialist industrialization. The question of "who will win" in industry had been resolved by the victory of socialist forms of industry. Thus, the Soviet Communist Party began to tackle the most difficult historical task after the proletariat seized power: leading millions of individual farmers onto the path of collective farms. At the end of 1929, the Soviet Communist Party implemented a decisive shift in policy: transitioning from a policy of restricting rich peasant exploitation to a policy of eliminating the rich peasant class on the basis of overall collectivization. The Soviet Communist Party launched a full-scale socialist offensive, mobilizing the working class and laboring masses to fight for the transformation of the entire national economy on a socialist basis and to fight for the completion of the First Five-Year Plan.

    In the works included in "The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume XII, Stalin demonstrates the essence of the full-scale socialist offensive, clarifies the art of the Party's leadership in socialist construction, elaborates on the issues of class struggle, the state, and national culture under the dictatorship of the proletariat, reveals the essence of the general crisis of capitalism, and points out the superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system and the path of development for the international workers' movement.

    The writings on the issue of agricultural collectivization occupy a very important position in this volume. Stalin developed and concretized Lenin's cooperative plan. In works such as "On the Right Deviation in the CPSU(B)," "The Year of the Great Turn," "On Some Questions of Soviet Land Policy," "Dizzy with Success," "Reply to Comrades Collective Farmers," and "Political Report of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) to the Sixteenth Congress," Stalin comprehensively demonstrated the policy of agricultural collectivization, pointed out the specific paths for achieving agricultural collectivization, exposed the counter-revolutionary fallacies of the right-wing opportunists on this issue, and theoretically and ideologically armed the Soviet working class and laboring peasants to fight for the socialist transformation of agriculture. At a time when the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement in our country has arrived, in-depth study of Stalin's works has significant practical significance for us to victoriously advance the agricultural cooperation movement.

    Since the Soviet Communist Party adopted the policy of attacking the rich peasants, the Bukharin-Rykov right-wing opportunist group exposed the counter-revolutionary essence of the rich peasants and openly opposed the Party's policy. Moreover, in terms of agricultural collectivization, due to the fact that the Soviet Union's theoretical work at the time lagged behind practice, various erroneous theories of bourgeois right-wing opportunism were able to circulate in social and political life, causing ideological confusion among practitioners. Therefore, right-wing deviation and conciliatory attitudes toward right-wing deviation were the main dangers of this period, and the struggle against right-wing deviation was one of the decisive tasks of the Party at that time. In criticizing the Bukharin group, Stalin pointed out that the main error of the right-wing opportunists was that they did not see and understand the new revolutionary processes taking place in the Soviet Union and in capitalist countries at that time; they neglected the class changes that politicians have no right to ignore, and therefore were at a loss and helpless in the face of the Party's new tasks. Stalin vividly cited the example of the fisherman on the Yenisei River encountering a storm, pointing out that the right-wing opportunist group's policies and actions were exactly the same as the fisherman's policies and actions of panicking and retreating in the face of difficulties. Stalin exposed the free bourgeois counter-revolutionary essence of Bukharin's right-wing opportunist "theory" of the rich peasants peacefully growing into socialism, and developed Lenin's principle of eliminating classes through the proletariat's cruel class struggle.

    In his writings, Stalin also demonstrated that the steps of agricultural cooperation must be adapted to socialist industrialization. He said that on the basis of rapid industrial development, cities have developed and industrial areas have increased or expanded, and therefore the demand for grain and industrial raw materials is constantly increasing. However, the output of grain and industrial raw materials cannot be rapidly increased on the basis of the individual small-peasant economy, because the small-peasant economy is unable to master new technologies, unable to fully increase labor productivity, and unable to fully increase the commodity rate of agricultural production. Therefore, "this creates the necessity of making agriculture keep up with the pace of industrial development in our country." (Page 52) Stalin criticized the theory of "balance" of various components of the national economy, and gave a correct evaluation of the small-peasant economy based on Marxist theory of reproduction. He pointed out that the small-peasant economy not only cannot achieve expanded reproduction, but also has little possibility of achieving simple reproduction. He said: "If the agricultural base is such a small-peasant economy that cannot achieve expanded reproduction and occupies a dominant position in our national economy, then can we accelerate the advance of our socialized industry? No, we cannot. Can we build the Soviet regime and the cause of socialist construction on two different bases for a considerable period of time, that is, on the basis of the largest and most unified socialist industry and on the basis of the most scattered and backward peasant small-commodity economy? No, we cannot. If this continues, one day it will cause the entire national economy to collapse." (Page 129) The way out is to guide the peasants to take the socialist road, realize agricultural cooperation, and make agriculture a large-scale agriculture that can achieve accumulation and expanded reproduction, thereby transforming the agricultural foundation of the national economy.

    Can agricultural cooperation come spontaneously, and can the small-peasant economy spontaneously follow socialist industry? Stalin made a profound analysis of this issue when criticizing the theory of "spontaneity" in socialist construction. Under the capitalist system, the countryside spontaneously and spontaneously follows the capitalist city, because the capitalist economy of the city and the small-commodity individual economy of the peasants are basically the same type of economy (both are based on private ownership of the means of production). However, the small-commodity individual economy of the peasants and the socialist economy of the city are by no means the same type of economy, because the spontaneous capitalist tendency of the peasants is contradictory to the socialism of the proletariat. Therefore, the small-peasant economy can never spontaneously follow the socialist city. Only by actively leading and transforming the small-peasant economy by the socialist city can the small-peasant economy be transformed into a socialist collective economy. The small-peasant economy cannot always stay in the same place; it either takes the capitalist road or the socialist road, and there is no third road, that is, the middle road, and it is impossible to have one.

    Will actively leading the small-peasant economy to take the socialist road weaken the worker-peasant alliance? Right-wing opportunists (the Bukharin group) once asserted that "accelerating the development of collective farms will only cause dissatisfaction among the masses and a rupture in the worker-peasant alliance." Stalin pointed out that this assertion has gone bankrupt and has been crushed; "the mass collective farm movement has not weakened but consolidated the worker-peasant alliance, giving the worker-peasant alliance a new, productive foundation." (Page 117)

    Stalin demonstrated the superiority of large-scale economy in agriculture when criticizing the "stability" theory of the small-peasant economy. He said that not only those collective farms with a machine tractor base, but even those "primary collective farms that rely on the peasants' original farm tools" (Page 137), simply putting the peasants' farm tools together for use has produced effects that practitioners could not have dreamed of. At the same time, Stalin pointed out that only by collectivizing the small-peasant economy can modern scientific achievements and new technologies be fully utilized.

    In his writings, Stalin profoundly elucidated the importance of implementing the Party's class policy in the countryside and the principle of voluntariness for ensuring the quality of the cooperation movement. Stalin taught us that we must be good at using the method of class analysis to deal with the peasant question. We must firmly establish the idea of relying on the poor peasants, and at the same time we must regard the middle peasants as reliable allies of the working class and the poor peasants. On the one hand, we must be good at coexisting with the middle peasants and never infringe on their interests, and on the other hand, we must adopt the method of persuasion to appropriately criticize the backward ideas of the middle peasants, especially the capitalist tendencies of the well-to-do middle peasants. Stalin particularly emphasized Lenin's principle of voluntariness when criticizing the main errors of the Soviet Union's collective farm movement at that time. He pointed out that in solving tasks of a military nature, cavalry-style raids can and must be adopted, but in solving the tasks of collective farm construction, cavalry-style raids are not applicable and are extremely harmful.

    In the early days of the Soviet Union's overall collectivization, some people made the mistake of being impatient and rash due to being dizzy with success, but this deviation was quickly overcome. Stalin made a profound demonstration of the special connection between "left" leaning excesses and right-wing opportunism. He pointed out, "In order to victoriously fight against right-wing opportunism, the errors of the 'left' leaning opportunists must be overcome. 'Left' leaning extremists are objectively allies of right-wing elements." (Page 191). Moreover, he emphasized that the main danger at that time was still the right-wing danger.

    Stalin, following Marx, Engels, and Lenin, developed the principles of Marxism-Leninism on agricultural cooperation. Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolution passed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party based on this report are examples of creatively applying Marxist-Leninist theory and the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. In the situation where the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement in our country has arrived, studying "The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume XII, can help us more deeply understand Comrade Mao Zedong's report and the resolutions of the Party Central Committee, and more effectively fight for the development of agricultural cooperation.

    “斯大林全集”第十二卷
    易惠群
    “斯大林全集”第十二卷包括斯大林在一九二九年四月到一九三零年六月这一时期的著作。这个时期，苏联的社会主义建设日益高涨，苏联在社会主义工业化方面已经取得重大的成就，“谁战胜谁”的问题在工业方面已经由社会主义形式的工业取得胜利而得到了解决。于是，苏联共产党就着手解决无产阶级革命在夺取政权后最困难的历史任务，即把千百万个体农民引上集体农庄的道路。一九二九年年底，苏联共产党在政策上实行了一个决定性的转变：从限制富农剥削的政策过渡到在全盘集体化的基础上消灭富农阶级的政策。苏联共产党展开了社会主义全线总进攻，动员工人阶级和劳动农民群众为在社会主义基础上改造整个国民经济而斗争，为完成第一个五年计划而斗争。
    在“斯大林全集”第十二卷所包括的著作中，斯大林论证了社会主义全线总进攻的实质，阐明了党领导社会主义建设的艺术；阐述了无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争、国家和民族文化问题；揭露了资本主义总危机的实质，指出了社会主义经济制度对资本主义经济制度的优越性和国际工人运动发展的道路。
    关于农业集体化问题的著作，在本卷中占有很重要的地位。斯大林发展了列宁的合作社计划并使其具体化。斯大林在“论联共（布）党内的右倾”“大转变的一年”“论苏联土地政策的几个问题”“胜利冲昏头脑”“答集体农庄庄员同志们”以及“联共（布）中央委员会向第十六次代表大会的政治报告”等著作中全面地论证了农业集体化的政策，指出了实现农业集体化的具体道路，揭穿了右倾机会主义者在这个问题上的反革命谬论，从理论上、思想上武装了苏联的工人阶级和劳动农民去为实现农业的社会主义改造而斗争。在我国农业合作化运动的高潮已经到来的时候，深入地学习斯大林的这些著作对于我们胜利地推进农业合作化运动具有重大的现实意义。
    自从苏联共产党采取向富农进攻的政策以来，布哈林—李可夫右倾机会主义集团就暴露了富农反革命本质，公开反对党的政策。加以，在农业集体化方面，由于苏联当时的理论工作落后于实践，资产阶级右倾机会主义的种种错误理论得以在社会政治生活中流行，引起实际工作者的思想混乱。因此，右倾和对右倾的调和态度是这个时期的主要危险，反右倾的斗争是当时党的决定性的任务之一。斯大林在批判布哈林集团时指出，右倾机会主义者的主要错误在于看不见和不了解当时苏联国内以及资本主义国家所发生的新的革命过程；忽略了政治家没有权利忽略的阶级变动，因而在党的新任务面前张皇失措和束手无策。斯大林生动地举出叶尼塞河上遇到风暴的渔夫为例，指出右倾机会主义集团的方针和行动同在困难面前张皇退却的渔夫的方针和行动一模一样。斯大林揭露了布哈林右倾机会主义的富农和平长入社会主义“理论”的自由资产阶级反革命本质，发展了列宁关于通过无产阶级的残酷的阶级斗争来消灭阶级的原理。
    斯大林在他的著作中还论证了农业合作化的步骤必须同社会主义工业化相适应的问题。他说，在工业迅速发展的基础上，城市发展起来了，工业区域增多或扩大了，因此，对于粮食和工业原料的需求也不断增长起来。可是在个体小农经济的基础上是不能使粮食和工业原料的产量迅速提高的，因为小农经济无力掌握新技术，无力充分提高劳动生产率，无力充分提高农业生产的商品率。所以，“由此就产生了使农业跟上我国工业发展速度的必要性。”（五二页）斯大林批判了国民经济各种成分“平衡”论，根据马克思主义的再生产理论给小农经济做了一个正确的评价。他指出，小农经济不仅不能实现扩大再生产，而且很少有可能实现简单的再生产。他说：“如果农业基础是这样一种既不能实现扩大再生产而又在我国国民经济中占优势的小农经济，那末能不能加速推进我国社会主义化的工业呢？不，不能。能不能在相当长的时期内把苏维埃政权和社会主义建设事业建立在两个不同的基础上，就是说，建立在最巨大最统一的社会主义工业基础上和最分散最落后的农民小商品经济基础上呢？不，不能。这样下去，总有一天会使整个国民经济全部崩溃。”（第一二九页）出路在于引导农民走社会主义的道路，实现农业合作化，使农业成为能实现积累和实现扩大再生产的大农业，从而改造国民经济的农业基础。
    农业合作化能不能自流地到来，小农经济能不能自流地跟着社会主义工业走呢？斯大林在批判社会主义建设“自流”论时对这个问题做了深刻的分析。在资本主义制度下，农村自发地、自流地跟着资本主义城市走，因为城市的资本主义经济和农民的小商品个体经济基本上是同一类型的经济（都以生产资料私有制为基础）。但是，农民的小商品个体经济和城市的社会主义经济决不是同一类型的经济，因为农民的自发的资本主义趋向是同无产阶级的社会主义相矛盾的。因此，小农经济决不能自流地跟着社会主义城市走。只有由社会主义城市积极地领导和改造小农经济，才能把小农经济变成社会主义的集体经济。小农经济不能总是停留在原来的地方，它不是走资本主义的道路，就是走社会主义的道路，第三条道路即中间的道路是没有而且不可能有的。
    积极地领导小农经济走社会主义的道路会不会削弱工农联盟呢？右倾机会主义者（布哈林集团）曾断言“加速发展集体农庄只会引起群众的不满和工农结合的破裂”。斯大林指出，这种断言已经破产而且被粉碎了；“群众性的集体农庄运动不是削弱而是巩固了工农结合，给了工农结合以新的、生产的基础。”（第一一七页）
    斯大林在批判小农经济“稳固”论时论证了农业中的大经济的优越性。他说，不仅是那些有机器拖拉机基础的集体农庄，就是那些“依靠农民的原有农具的初级集体农庄”（第一三七页），单是把农民的农具集合起来使用就产生了实际工作者所梦想不到的效果。同时，斯大林指出，只有使小农经济集体化，才能充分利用现代科学成就和新技术。
    斯大林在他的著作中深刻地阐明了贯彻党在农村中的阶级政策和自愿原则对保证合作化运动质量的重要意义。斯大林教导我们，必须善于用阶级分析的方法来处理农民问题。我们必须牢固地确立依靠贫农的思想，同时必须把中农看做工人阶级和贫农的可靠的同盟者，一方面要善于同中农共处，决不侵犯中农的利益，另一方面要采取说服的方法来适当地批评中农的落后思想，特别是批评富裕中农的资本主义倾向。斯大林在批判苏联当时集体农庄运动的主要错误时特别强调列宁的自愿原则。他指出，在解决军事性质的任务时，可以而且必须采取骑兵式的突袭，但是在解决集体农庄建设任务时，骑兵式的突袭就是不适用的和极端有害的了。
    在苏联全盘集体化的初期，有些人因为被胜利冲昏头脑，犯了急躁冒进的错误，但这个偏向很快就克服了。斯大林对“左”倾过火行为和右倾机会主义之间的特殊联系做了深刻的论证。他指出，“为了胜利地和右倾机会主义作斗争，必须克服‘左’倾机会主义者的错误。“‘左’倾过火分子在客观上是右倾分子的同盟者。”（第一九一页）。而且他着重提到当时主要危险仍然是右倾危险。
    斯大林继马克思、恩格斯、列宁之后，发挥了马克思列宁主义关于农业合作化的原理。毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中国共产党七届六中全会根据这一报告所通过的决议，是创造性地运用马克思列宁主义理论和苏联社会主义建设经验的范例。在我国农业合作化运动高潮已经到来的形势下，学习“斯大林全集”第十二卷可以帮助我们更深刻地领会毛泽东同志的报告和党中央的决议，更有效地为发展农业合作化而斗争。
