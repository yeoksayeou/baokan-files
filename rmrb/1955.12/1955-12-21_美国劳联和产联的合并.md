    Merger of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations
    Ji Long
    In early December, the two largest labor unions in the United States—the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations—formally merged into a united labor union named the "American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations," abbreviated as "AFL-CIO." Through this merger, more than 140 national unions have joined this new union organization, with approximately 15.54 million members, accounting for about 88 percent of the total number of workers in the United States who are members of labor unions. This is the labor union with the largest number of members in American history and the largest labor organization in the capitalist world. Undoubtedly, this merger of the two major labor unions is likely to bring significant impacts and developments to the future economic and political struggles of the American working class. The "New York Times" on December 1st headlined its report on this merger as "Domestic Labor Movement Reaches New Peak Through Unification," illustrating the importance the American bourgeoisie attaches to the merger of the AFL and CIO.
    The merger of the AFL and CIO is a major development in the American labor union organization from division to unity, basically ending the serious situation of division and mutual opposition between the two major labor unions in the United States for the past 20 years. In fact, the opposition and discord between the AFL and CIO for the past 20 years have only been caused by their upper-level leaders adhering to the intentions of monopoly capital and stubbornly opposing the unification of labor union forces. The American working class has not only never advocated such opposition and division, but, on the contrary, has increasingly realized in actual struggles that the division of worker organizations is only detrimental to the working class itself. Due to the cruel attacks by monopoly capital on worker organizations in recent years, the working class has also increasingly felt the need for unity and unification in action and organization in order to counter such attacks. Therefore, in the past year or two, there have been an increasing number of examples of solidarity, joint action, and mutual support between many labor unions in actual struggles. Many union conferences have also put forward the slogan "Unite Our Strength." Obviously, it was only because of the increasingly high call from the broad masses of workers for national unity, and the actual negotiations on mergers that had been carried out by individual labor unions and local organizations, that the upper-level leaders of the AFL and CIO had to seriously consider merging and realized it in 1955. The merger of the AFL and CIO is in line with the interests of the American working class. As William Z. Foster, chairman of the Communist Party USA, pointed out: This merger will make organized labor in the United States a greatly increased potential force, and on every front of the class struggle, the labor movement will greatly increase the possibility of realizing the various demands of the working class.
    What American workers demand is not just a merger in organizational form, but the realization of their various demands through unified organization and concerted action. Because only through unified organization and concerted action can their strength be increased and victory in the political and economic struggle against monopoly capital be guaranteed. Here, first of all, there must be a policy and program that conforms to the interests of the working class. Unfortunately, this is what the AFL and CIO have lacked for many years. The leaders of the merged "AFL-CIO" are still the leaders of the old AFL and CIO, who have consistently been anti-communist, anti-Soviet, and supported the war policies of American monopoly capital for many years. When AFL President Meany and CIO President Reuther issued a joint statement on the decision of the two unions to merge last year, they also shamelessly stated that all their efforts would be to strengthen the "struggle against communism." The purpose of this compromise and reactionary words and deeds by the upper-level leaders of the labor unions is to win the favor of monopoly capital, and to take the opportunity of the merger to obstruct the growing American labor movement, attempting to use the new organization as a tool to oppose the vital interests of the working class and oppose progress and democracy. This shows that after the merger of the AFL and CIO, progressive forces must still carry out arduous struggles to make it an organization that truly safeguards the interests of the American working class.
    In order to give full play to the potential strength of this new and huge labor union organization and to realize the various demands of the working class, internal democracy in the labor union is absolutely necessary. Only on the basis of democracy can the labor union truly represent the interests of the working class, and can the bureaucratic leadership currently existing, which violates the interests of the working class and is controlled by a few people, be changed. The official constitution of the "AFL-CIO" has not yet been seen, but judging from various reports and comments on the draft constitution, it is obviously lacking in democratic systems: labor union members have very little say, and the labor union will actually be controlled by a small number of labor union directors. As William Z. Foster pointed out, these people have high incomes and are often capitalists themselves. They can only hinder the labor movement and cannot help its development. Their ideology is almost indistinguishable from that of the employers. Without a democratic system to ensure the correct line of the labor union and to implement it, there is no doubt that this will bring great harm to the working class. Therefore, the American working class will increasingly recognize this fact, maintain high vigilance and carry out continuous struggles. We must also see this aspect when evaluating this merger of the AFL and CIO.
    Outside the "AFL-CIO" there are still some independent labor unions, including the United Mine Workers of America, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, all of which are labor union organizations with a considerable number of members. As the starting point for the new unity of American labor, the "AFL-CIO" should strive for the great unity of national labor organizations on the basis of democracy and progress in accordance with the interests and wishes of the working class. According to a report in the "New York Times" on December 1st, there are currently 65 million workers in the United States, and the total number of workers who are members of labor unions only accounts for a quarter of the total number of workers. This is a serious weakness in the American labor movement. From 1937 to 1942, because the then-emerging CIO vigorously launched a union organization movement, holding high the banner of "organizing the unorganized workers," it also forced the AFL to carry out organizational work. The number of workers nationwide participating in labor unions soared from 3 million to more than 14 million. In the following ten years, it only increased by 2 million, while in the past three years, the total number has declined. It can be seen that the AFL and CIO have been very passive in organizing the strength of the working class in the past. The phenomenon of insufficient union organization is most significant in the textile, chemical, and shoe industries. To this day, two-thirds of textile workers have not organized labor unions. The most serious shortcoming in developing labor unions is in the Southern states, where discrimination against black people greatly hinders the work of organizing labor unions in the South. Even in the new draft constitution of the "AFL-CIO," there are still gaps left for this extremely reactionary policy of racial discrimination. Monopoly capital certainly does not want to see all workers united in a unified organization. If the "AFL-CIO" continues to adopt a passive policy of exclusivism and racial discrimination, it will actually obstruct the unity of national workers, harm the interests of the working class, and serve monopoly capital. In order to make the American workers' union organization a strong fighting force, a unified union including all workers, regardless of industry or race, is absolutely necessary. This is in line with the overall interests of the American working class.
    In commenting on the merger of the AFL and CIO, William Z. Foster, chairman of the Communist Party USA, called on American workers to enthusiastically support this merger, strive for a progressive program, and massively organize the unorganized workers; and on the other hand, vigorously launch struggles for democratic systems in labor union organizations. This is a correct view aimed at the specific situation of the current establishment of the "AFL-CIO." Only in this way can the full potential of the American working class be fully developed, forming a vibrant, unified, and powerful fighting force to fight for peace and democracy.

    美国劳联和产联的合并
    纪隆
    美国两个最大的工会——美国劳工联合会和产业工会联合会——在十二月初正式合并为一个联合工会，名为“美国劳工联合会和产业工会联合会”，简称为“劳联—产联”。通过这次合并，共有一百四十多个全国性的工会参加到这个新的工会联合组织里来，拥有约一千五百四十万会员，占美国全国参加工会组织的工人总数的百分之八十八左右。这是美国历史上会员人数最多的工会，也是资本主义世界里最大的工会组织。无疑地，两大工会的这次合并有可能为今后美国工人阶级在经济、政治各方面的斗争带来重大的影响和发展。十二月一日“纽约时报”把对这一合并的报道标题为“国内劳工运动通过统一而达到了新的高峰”，说明了美国资产阶级对于劳联和产联的合并的重视。
    劳联和产联的合并是美国工会组织从分裂走向团结的一个重大发展，基本上结束了二十年来美国两大工会的分裂和互相对立的严重情况。事实上，二十年来劳联和产联的对立和不和只是它们的上层领导分子奉行着垄断资本的意旨，顽固地反对工会力量的统一所造成的。美国工人阶级不但从来没有主张过这种对立和分裂，相反地，在实际的斗争中日益认识到工人组织的分裂只是不利于工人阶级自己。由于这几年来垄断资本对工人组织的残酷进攻，为了回击这种进攻，工人阶级也日益感到在行动中和组织方面的团结和统一的必要。因而，在最近一、二年中，许多工会之间，在实际斗争中团结一致、共同行动和相互支持的例子就不断增多起来。许多工会大会也纷纷提出“统一我们的力量”的口号。显然地，只是由于广大的工人群众要求全国性的团结的呼声日益高涨，以及个别工会和地方组织实际上已进行了关于合并的协商，才迫使劳联和产联的上层领导不得不认真考虑合并，并且在一九五五年予以实现。劳联和产联的合并是符合于美国工人阶级的利益的。正如美共主席威廉·福斯特指出：这个合并将使美国有组织的劳工成为一支大大增加了的潜在力量，在阶级斗争的每一条战线上，劳工运动都将大大提高实现工人阶级的各种要求的可能性。
    美国工人所要求的并不是仅仅组织形式上的合并，而是通过统一的组织和一致的行动来实现他们的各种要求。因为只有通过统一的组织和一致的行动才能增加他们的力量，保证在同垄断资本的政治的和经济的斗争中取得胜利。这里，首先必须要有一个符合工人阶级的利益的政策和纲领。不幸，这却是劳联和产联多年来所缺少的。合并后的“劳联—产联”的领导仍然是旧劳联和产联的领导，他们多年来一贯反共、反苏、支持美国垄断资本的战争政策。劳联主席米尼和产联主席路德去年就两个工会决定合并发表联合声明的时候，还厚颜无耻地表示他们的一切努力将都是为了要加强“对共产主义的斗争”。工会上层领导的这种妥协和反动的言行，目的是在博得垄断资本的欢心，并且，想利用合并的机会阻挠美国日益增长的工人运动，企图利用新组织作为反对工人阶级的切身利益和反对进步和民主的力量的工具。这说明了在劳联和产联合并后，进步力量还须进行艰苦的斗争，以使它成为真正维护美国工人阶级利益的组织。
    要使合并后这个新的巨大的工会组织的潜在力量充分发挥，使工人阶级的各种要求得到实现，工会内部的民主是完全必要的。只有在民主的基础上才能使工会真正代表工人阶级的利益，才能改变目前所存在的违反工人阶级利益的、被把持在少数人手里的官僚主义的领导。“劳联—产联”正式章程还没有见到，但从各方面关于章程草案的报道和评论来看，它显然缺乏民主的制度：工会会员的发言权极小，工会将实际被控制在少数的工会理事手里。正如威廉·福斯特所指出的，这些人有着丰厚的收入，往往自己就是资本家，他们只能阻碍劳工运动，而不能帮助它的发展。他们的意识形态同雇主们的意识形态几乎没有分别。如果没有民主制度来保证工会的正确路线并予以实现，没有疑问，这会给工人阶级带来巨大的危害。因此，美国工人阶级将会越来越认清这一事实，保持高度警惕并进行不断的斗争。我们在评价这次劳联和产联的合并的时候也必须看到这一面。
    在“劳联—产联”以外现在还有一些独立工会，其中有联合煤矿工人工会、铁路工人兄弟会、开采、冶炼工人工会等，都是拥有相当人数的工会组织。作为美国劳工新团结起点的“劳联—产联”应该依照工人阶级的利益和愿望，在民主和进步的基础上争取全国劳工组织的大团结。据十二月一日的“纽约时报”报道，美国现有工人六千五百万，而现在所有参加工会的工人一共只占工人全数的四分之一，这是美国工人运动中的一个严重的弱点。一九三七年至一九四二年期间，由于当时新兴的产联高举着“没有组织起来的工人组织起来”的旗帜大力展开组织工会运动，因而也逼得劳联开展组织工作，美国全国参加工会的工人从三百万猛升到一千四百多万，在以后的十年里只增加了两百万，而在最近三年里总数反而减退，可见过去劳联和产联对于组织工人阶级的力量是十分消极的。工会组织不够的现象在纺织、化学、制鞋等产业最为显著，纺织业工人至今还有三分之二没有组织工会。在开展工会方面最严重的缺点是在南方各州，由于对黑种人的歧视大大妨碍了南方组织工会的工作。甚至在“劳联—产联”的新章程草案里仍然为这种极端反动的种族歧视政策留着空隙。垄断资本当然是不愿意看见所有的工人都团结在一个统一的组织里的，
  “劳联—产联”如果继续采取消极的关门主义和种族歧视政策，实际上就是阻挠全国工人的团结，损害工人阶级的利益，为垄断资本服务。要使美国工人的工会组织成为一个强大的战斗队伍，不分行业和种族，包括全体工人的一个统一的工会是完全必要的。这是符合美国工人阶级的全体利益的。
    美国共产党主席福斯特在评论劳联和产联的合并时，号召美国工人应该一方面热诚地支持这个合并，争取进步的纲领，大规模地组织还没有组织起来的工人；而另一方面在工会组织里为民主的制度大力展开斗争。这是针对着当前“劳联—产联”成立的具体情况的正确的看法。也只有这样才能使美国工人阶级的全部潜在力量得到充分的发挥，组成一支生气勃勃的、统一的、强大的战斗队伍，为和平、民主而奋斗。
