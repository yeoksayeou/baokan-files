    The main tea-producing areas of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province have achieved an unprecedented bumper tea harvest this year. The amount of tea purchased by the Yunnan Provincial Tea Company in the Xishuangbanna tea region has exceeded the plan by 21.94 percent, more than double the amount in the same period last year.
    This year, the People's Committee of Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture strengthened its leadership in the development of tea production and established a Tea Work Committee. The People's Bank issued more than 300,000 yuan in tea loans this year to help tea farmers with their production. This year's summer tea in various tea areas increased by 18.8 times compared to last year, and autumn tea increased by nearly 30 times compared to last year.
    The increase in tea production has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of tea farmers. Tea farmers of all ethnic groups have actively reclaimed old tea gardens and planted new seedlings. The Gelanghe Aini Autonomous Region has already planted tens of thousands of new seedlings. The Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee has decided to collect more than 20,000 jin of tea seeds and cultivate more than 7 million tea seedlings next year.

    西双版纳傣族自治州茶叶丰收
    云南省西双版纳傣族自治州主要茶区，今年茶叶获得了空前的丰收。云南省茶业公司在西双版纳茶区收购茶叶的数量，已经超过计划百分之二十一点九四，比去年同时期增加一倍以上。
    西双版纳自治州人民委员会今年加强了对发展茶叶生产的领导，成立了茶叶工作委员会。人民银行今年发放了三十多万元茶叶贷款，帮助茶农进行生产。各茶区今年的夏茶比去年增产十八点八倍，秋茶比去年增产将近三十倍。
    茶叶增产大大鼓舞了茶农的生产积极性。各族茶农纷纷垦复旧茶园，种植新苗。格朗和僾尼族自治区已经种下了十数万棵新苗。自治州人民委员会决定收集二万多斤茶籽，在明年培植七百多万棵茶苗。
