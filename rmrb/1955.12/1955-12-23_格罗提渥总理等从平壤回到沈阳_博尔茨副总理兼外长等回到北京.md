Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 22nd: Otto Grotewohl, head of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, and some members of the delegation arrived in Shenyang by special plane from Andong on the morning of the 22nd and visited Shenyang.

Du Zheheng, Governor of Liaoning Province, Wang Zheng, Second Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Liu Baotian, Mayor of Shenyang, and Jiao Ruoyu, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and more than 2,500 other people welcomed Prime Minister Grotewohl at the Shenyang airport.

On the morning of the 22nd, Prime Minister Grotewohl and others toured the urban area of Shenyang and visited the Northeast Industrial Exhibition Hall. In the afternoon, Prime Minister Grotewohl and others visited the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang. The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed by the men and women farmers of Gaokan Village.

Zhang Zhenfa, director of the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative, introduced to the distinguished guests the situation of increased production and improved living standards of the farmers in Gaokan Village after embarking on the road of collectivization. Prime Minister Grotewohl paid tribute to the farmers of Gaokan Village on behalf of the German farmers and all peace-loving German people. He said: You have only established agricultural production cooperatives for three years, and your lives have been greatly improved. In another thirty years, your lives will be even more prosperous, and your next generation will live a better life than you. Prime Minister Grotewohl also said that German farmers are also moving towards agricultural collectivization. Our basic situation is the same, and the methods are similar, but the conditions are different because we have a common goal—building socialism. Prime Minister Grotewohl said that the construction of farmers is for peace, not for war. It is better to have tractors than tanks on your land. He wished the farmers of Gaokan Village and the Chinese farmers to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, to embark on the road of collectivization, to live a happy life, and to dedicate their production achievements to the cause of defending peace.

Ennst Ulf, a member of the delegation, director of the Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, and Labor Hero, then introduced the situation of agricultural collectivization in Germany.
