Make Rural Roads Accessible in All Directions

    The Xingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, is building a five-li long, eight-chi wide avenue. This avenue is being built on a beautiful mountain ridge that runs across the cooperative's farmland. They also plan to continue building eight branch roads starting next year. After these roads are completed, carts can travel throughout the cooperative's fields, changing the local method of transportation, which has historically relied on manual labor, thus wasting manpower.

    The Xingxing Agricultural Cooperative recently formulated a comprehensive plan for developing production. According to this plan, the total grain output of the cooperative will reach 457,771 jin by 1960, averaging 1,413 jin per person, an increase of 73.2 percent compared to 1955. Including rapeseed, cotton, and other various sideline income, each member's income in 1960 will increase by more than 117 percent compared to 1955. The members are attracted by this promising prospect and have come up with various ways to increase production. Building roads, changing transportation methods, and improving labor efficiency are among the cooperative's measures to increase production.

    With the needs of the agricultural cooperative movement and agricultural production development, mass road construction and bridge repair activities will increase day by day. In the near future, the rural transportation landscape will be completely renewed.

    让乡村道路四通八达
    湖北省浠水县望城乡星星农业生产合作社正在修筑一条五里长、八尺宽的大道。这条大道是修在横贯全社农田的一个美丽的山岗上。他们还计划从明年开始继续修筑八条支道。这些道路修好以后，大车可以在整个合作社的田间通行，改变当地历来用人挑的那种浪费劳动力的运输方法。
    星星农业合作社不久以前曾制定了一个发展生产的全面规划。根据这个规划，全社到一九六○年粮食年产量可达四十五万七千七百七十一斤，平均每人一千四百一十三斤，比一九五五年增加百分之七十三点二，加上油菜籽、棉花及其它各种副业收入，一九六○年每个社员的收入比一九五五年增加百分之一百一十七强，社员们被这种幸福的前景所吸引，想出了各种增产办法。修道路，改变运输办法，提高劳动效率，就是这个社的增产措施之一。
    随着农业合作化运动和农业生产发展的需要，群众性的筑路、修桥的事情将要一天天地多起来，不久的将来，乡村里的交通面貌就会焕然一新了。
