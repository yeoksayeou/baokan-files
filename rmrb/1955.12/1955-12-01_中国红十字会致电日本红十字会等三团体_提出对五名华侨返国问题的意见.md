Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The Chinese Red Cross sent a telegram on November 30th to the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan Peace Liaison Council, and the Japan-China Friendship Association Liaison Office, expressing its opinions on the return of five overseas Chinese, including Hong Jinshan and Pan Guangkun, to China.

In its telegram, the Chinese Red Cross first expressed its gratitude to the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan Peace Liaison Council, and the Japan-China Friendship Association for their efforts to enable the five overseas Chinese, Hong Jinshan, Pan Guangkun, and others, to return to Tianjin on the "Xingan Maru," and expressed sympathy for the extremely difficult situation they were in as a result of their efforts consistently failing to achieve results.

The telegram from the Chinese Red Cross then stated: "The Chinese side has consistently respected the wishes of Japanese nationals in China to return to their country and has assisted them in doing so. The struggle of overseas Chinese in Japan and all righteous people in your country against the failure of Hong Jinshan and the other four to voluntarily return to their country this time proves that the humanitarian principle of voluntary repatriation of nationals from both countries is supported by the people of China and Japan."

The Chinese Red Cross concluded: "Since the relevant Japanese authorities also recognize the principle of voluntary repatriation, in order to overcome the current difficulties, we suggest that the Liaison Office of the three organizations obtain a guarantee from the relevant authorities in your country that Hong Jinshan, Pan Guangkun, Guo Quanzao, Gu Minsheng, and Cai Jinxiu can return to China in the near future. Based on this, they should then explain the situation to the overseas Chinese in your country so that the 'Xingan Maru' can set sail, realizing the desire for an early reunion between the nationals of China and Japan and their respective families at home. We await your reply."

Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Tokyo dispatch: Representatives of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan Peace Liaison Council, and the Japan-China Friendship Association have continued to negotiate with the Japanese government for days, demanding the release of the Chinese nationals Hong Jinshan, Pan Guangkun, and others who were illegally arrested.

However, in a "report" given to the three organizations on November 26, the Japanese government stated that they could only be released after the conclusion of the "criminal proceedings" against Pan Guangkun, Guo Quanzao, Gu Minsheng, and Cai Jinxiu, and the "full investigation" of Hong Jinshan. That evening, Eichi Tanaka, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Hatoyama Cabinet, reiterated to the representatives of the three organizations, including Kajii Kasai, that the Japanese government "cannot allow these five people to board the ship at this time." On the 28th, after discussing with Foreign Ministry Administrative Vice-Minister Suemitsu Kadowaki, Tanaka Eichi once again announced that the Japanese government refused to allow Hong Jinshan and the other four to board the "Xingan Maru" to return to their country.

This attitude of the Japanese government meant that the efforts of the aforementioned three organizations did not achieve results, violating the desire for an early reunion between the nationals of both countries scheduled to return home this time and their respective families at home. Many organizations and people from all walks of life in Japan have expressed dissatisfaction and criticism of this attitude of the Japanese government.

    中国红十字会致电日本红十字会等三团体
    提出对五名华侨返国问题的意见
    新华社三十日讯　中国红十字会十一月三十日打电报给日本红十字会、日本和平联络会、日中友好协会三团体联络事务局，对洪进山、潘广坤等五名华侨返回中国的问题提出自己的意见。
    中国红十字会在电报中首先对日本红十字会、日本和平联络会、日中友好协会为了使洪进山、潘广坤等五名华侨能乘“兴安丸”返回天津所做的种种努力表示感谢，并且对它们的努力一直未能获致结果，从而使它们陷于极度困难的境地，表示同情。
    中国红十字会的电报接着说：“中国方面一贯尊重在中国的日本侨民的返国志愿并且协助他们返国。在日本的华侨和一切主持正义的贵国人士对于洪进山等五人这次不能志愿返国而奋起力争，足以证明两国侨民志愿返国的人道原则是得到中日两国人民的共同支持的。”
    中国红十字会最后说：“既然日本有关当局也承认志愿返国的原则，为了摆脱目前的困难，我们建议三团体联络事务局从贵国有关当局方面获得洪进山、潘广坤、郭全灶、顾敏生、蔡晋修五人能在最近期间返回中国的保证后，即据此向在贵国的华侨进行解释，使‘兴安丸’得以启航，以实现中日两国侨民和他们各自在国内的家属早日团聚的愿望。我们等待你们的答复。”
    新华社三十日讯　东京消息：日本红十字会、日本和平联络会和日中友好协会的代表，为了要求释放被非法拘捕的中国侨民洪进山、潘广坤等五人，连日继续向日本政府进行了交涉。
    但是，日本政府在十一月二十六日给三团体的一份“报告书”中表示，必须对潘广坤、郭全灶、顾敏生、蔡晋修等四人进行的“刑事诉讼”和对洪进山的“全面调查”结束以后，才能释放他们。当天晚上，鸠山内阁副官房长官田中英一向三团体的代表葛西嘉资等人重申日本政府“现在不能让这五个人上船”。二十八日，田中英一在同外务省事务次官门胁季光讨论之后，又再次宣布日本政府拒绝允许洪进山等五人搭乘“兴安丸”回国。
    日本政府的这种态度使得上述三团体的努力没有获得结果，违背了这次预定回国的两国侨民和他们各自在国内的家人早日团聚的愿望。日本的许多团体和社会人士已对日本政府的这种态度表示了不满和指责。
