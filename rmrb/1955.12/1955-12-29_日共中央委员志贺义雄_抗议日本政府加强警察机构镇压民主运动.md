Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 28th: Japanese Communist Party Central Committee member Yoshio Shiga protested to Justice Minister Ryozo Makino on December 24th regarding the Japanese government's decision to strengthen police agencies and other reactionary measures. He pointed out that the Japanese government is restoring the pre-war political police and plotting to establish an American McCarthy-style system.

The Japanese government, at a cabinet meeting held on December 24th, decided, based on Justice Minister Ryozo Makino's proposal, to strengthen an organization similar to the former "Special Higher Police" – the "Public Security Investigation Agency" – to suppress the Japanese Communist Party and trade union movement and other democratic movements. After the meeting, Makino Ryozo also publicly stated that he would closely coordinate with the Ministry of Labor and the special intelligence agency established by the former Yoshida government – the Cabinet Research Office – and other relevant agencies to "further enhance security measures."

After protesting to Makino Ryozo, Yoshio Shiga published an article in "Akahata" on December 27th, writing that it has become a practice for the Japanese government to persecute communists, activists in trade unions, and Koreans in Japan whenever it attempts to suppress democracy.

Yoshio Shiga wrote that Japan has already placed the national police under central control this year. Next year, in addition to the regular police budget, the budget for security police will increase to 1.4 billion yen. He pointed out that these signs indicate that the Japanese government authorities are plotting to implement McCarthy-style political persecution in Japan.

    日共中央委员志贺义雄   
    抗议日本政府加强警察机构镇压民主运动
    新华社二十八日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员志贺义雄在十二月二十四日曾经就日本政府决定加强警察机构等反动措施，向法务相牧野良三提出了抗议，并且指出日本政府正在恢复战前的政治警察，阴谋建立美国麦卡锡式的制度。
    日本政府在十二月二十四日举行的内阁会议上，根据法务相牧野良三的主张，曾经决定加强类似以前“特高”警察的机构——“公安调查厅”，来镇压日本共产党和工会运动等民主运动。会后，牧野良三还公开说，他要同劳动省和前吉田政府建立的特务机构——内阁调查室等有关机构密切联系，“进一步充实治安对策”。
    志贺义雄向牧野良三提出抗议后，十二月二十七日又在“赤旗报”发表文章写道，日本政府每当企图压制民主的时候，就迫害共产党和工会中的积极分子以及在日本的朝鲜人，这已经成了惯例。
    志贺义雄写道，日本今年已经把国家警察改归中央统辖。明年，除了常规警察的经费外，保安警察的经费将增加到十四亿日元。他指出，这种迹象表明，日本政府当局正在阴谋在日本实行麦卡锡式的政治迫害。
