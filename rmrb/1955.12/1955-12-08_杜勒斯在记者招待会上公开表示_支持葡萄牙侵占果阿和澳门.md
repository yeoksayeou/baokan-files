Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 7th—U.S. Secretary of State Dulles once again expressed open support for Portuguese colonialists occupying territories of India and China at a press conference on the 6th. He said that he considers Goa in India to be a "province" of Portugal, and that the status of the other two places in India and Macau along the coast of China is "exactly the same" as Goa.

When a reporter raised a question, he mentioned that the joint communiqué recently issued by Dulles and Portuguese Foreign Minister Cunha referring to Goa as a province of Portugal had already caused a "disturbance" in India. The reporter asked Dulles if he was aware that his mention of the Portuguese provinces again would cause the same "disturbance."

In his response, Dulles stated that the United States insisted on the attitude of supporting Portugal's colonial policies in the joint communiqué, saying, "We went through a very careful consideration, the communiqué was not published lightly."

Speaking of the Sino-American talks, Dulles said, "The talks have not made as much progress as one might have hoped." He then attempted to shirk the responsibility for the United States causing this situation, stubbornly insisting that China, which had fully fulfilled the agreement, "has not reached a sufficient degree" in allowing Americans in China to quickly exercise their right to return home, while attempting to distract people from the attitude taken by the United States in the talks, which was not conducive to reaching an agreement. Dulles added, "Apart from that, the talks are proceeding in a normal manner."

At the press conference, Dulles made slanderous attacks on the anti-colonialist remarks made by Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev in India and Burma.

    杜勒斯在记者招待会上公开表示
    支持葡萄牙侵占果阿和澳门
    新华社七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯六日在记者招待会上又一次对占领着印度和中国的领土的葡萄牙殖民主义者表示公开的支持。他说，他认为，印度的果阿是属于葡萄牙的“一个省”，在印度的其他两个地方以及中国沿海的澳门的地位也是同果阿“完全一样的”。
    有记者在提出问题的时候谈到杜勒斯和葡萄牙外交部长库纳最近发表的联合公报里把果阿称为葡萄牙的一个省已经在印度引起“风波”。有记者问杜勒斯，他是不是知道他又这样提到葡萄牙的省份会引起同样的“风波”。
    杜勒斯在答复里表示美国坚持联合公报中支持葡萄牙殖民政策的态度，他说，“我们经过了非常仔细的考虑，那个公报不是轻率发表的”。
    杜勒斯在谈到中美会谈时说，“这一会谈并没有在取得人们所能希望的那样良好的进展”。他接着企图推卸美国造成这种情况的责任，硬说已经充分履行协议的中国在让在中国的美国人能够迅速行使他们回国的权利上“还没有达到充分的程度”，而企图使人不注意美国在会谈中所采取的无助于达成协议的态度。杜勒斯又说，“除此之外，会谈是在按照正常的方式进行的”。
    杜勒斯在记者招待会上对苏联领导者布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在印度和缅甸发表的反对殖民主义的言论进行诬蔑性的攻击。
