Xinhua News Agency, December 30th. The ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Romanian People's Republic Folk Art Exhibition was held in Beijing on the 30th—the anniversary of the eighth anniversary of the founding of the Romanian People's Republic.

The ribbon-cutting ceremony was presided over by Chen Zhongjing, Acting Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations. Guests attending the ceremony included Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture; Ding Xilin and Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Ministers of Culture; Jiang Guangnai, Minister of Textile Industry; Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Wei Que, Vice Minister of Education; Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; Feng Jiping, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; figures from the capital's art circles; and more than 200 people, including diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China.

Munteanu, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Romanian Embassy in China, was invited to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing delivered a speech at the ceremony, congratulating the opening of the exhibition. He said that the friendly cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and Romania have made remarkable achievements in the past few years. I believe that this exhibition will not only be warmly welcomed by the Chinese people and help enhance the Chinese people's understanding of the Romanian people, but also provide the Chinese art circles with an opportunity to learn.

Munteanu, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Romanian Embassy in China, then delivered a speech. He said that the opening of this exhibition on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the Romanian People's Republic is a special concern for the Romanian people. The Chinese handicraft exhibition held in Romania and this exhibition held in China are only two of the fruitful results of cultural cooperation between China and Romania. This cultural cooperation, as well as cooperation in economic and scientific technology, is particularly valuable to the Romanian people. He finally shouted "Long live Sino-Romanian friendship" in Chinese.

Professor Bonoganyo of the Bucharest Academy of Fine Arts and Curator of the Folk Museum also spoke at the ceremony.

After Shen Yanbing cut the ribbon for the exhibition, Munteanu accompanied the guests to visit the exhibition.

    文化部部长沈雁冰在仪式上致词，祝贺展览会的开幕。他说，中罗两国的友好合作和文化交流，在过去几年中已经取得了显著的成绩。我相信这次展览会不仅会受到中国人民的热烈欢迎，有助于增进中国人民对罗马尼亚人民的了解，而且也使中国美术界得到了学习的机会。
    罗马尼亚驻华大使馆临时代办孟天努接着致词。他说，这个展览会在罗马尼亚人民共和国建立八周年纪念日开幕，是对于罗马尼亚人民的特别关怀。在罗马尼亚举行的中国手工艺展览会和在中国举行的这次展览会，只不过是中罗两国文化合作的丰硕成果中的两项。这种文化合作以及经济和科学技术方面的合作，对罗马尼亚人民都是特别宝贵的。他最后用中国话高呼“中罗友谊万岁”。
