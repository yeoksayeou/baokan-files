The Ministry of Water Resources recently approved a construction plan for the Hun River's Dahuo Fang Reservoir project to impound floodwaters one year ahead of schedule, in 1957. This is a measure to adapt to the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and ensure increased grain production.

The Hun River's Dahuo Fang Reservoir project is one of the key projects in China's first Five-Year Plan for water conservancy construction and is an important project for fundamentally controlling the water hazards of the Liao River and developing the water resources of the Hun River. After the completion of this reservoir, the banks of the lower reaches of the Hun River will be basically free from flood disasters, and the water hazards of the lower reaches of the Liao River can also be alleviated. The floodwaters impounded by the reservoir can be used to build a 30,000 to 40,000 kilowatt hydroelectric power station, supplying a portion of electricity to industrial areas such as Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi, and Anshan, and can also be used to irrigate 60,000 hectares of farmland in the Liao River Plain in the lower reaches of the Hun River, which is expected to increase grain production by 12 million jin per year. The industrial water needs of Shenyang and Fushun will also be met.

Currently, the Dahuo Fang Reservoir construction site is carrying out large-scale winter construction in full swing. Tens of thousands of laborers are working day and night to split mountains and build dams, and are preparing for even larger-scale construction next year.

    大伙房水库将提前拦洪蓄水
    水利部最近批准了浑河大伙房水库工程提前一年，在一九五七年拦洪蓄水的施工计划。这是适应农业合作化高潮，保证粮食增产的一项措施。
    浑河大伙房水库工程是我国第一个五年计划水利建设的重点项目之一，是根治辽河水害和开发浑河水利的重要工程。这个水库建成以后，将使浑河下游两岸基本上免除洪水灾害，辽河下游的水害也可因此减轻。水库拦蓄的洪水，可以用以建设三万到四万瓩的水力发电站，供应沈阳、抚顺、本溪、鞍山等工业地区一部分电力，并且可以用来灌溉浑河下游辽河平原的六万垧农田，预计每年可因此增产粮食一千二百万斤。沈阳、抚顺两市的工业用水也可以得到满足。
    目前，大伙房水库工地正在紧张地进行大规模的冬季施工。上万的劳动大军夜以继日地劈山筑坝，并在为明年更大规模的施工进行准备。
