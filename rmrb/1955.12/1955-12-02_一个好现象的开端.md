    The Beginning of a Good Phenomenon
    Recently, the Jinnan branch of the state-owned Transportation Electrical Equipment Company is about to deliver a two-ton truck to the "Liaoyuan" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangcun, Jieyu County, Shanxi, according to the contract.
    The "Liaoyuan" Agricultural Production Cooperative has 300 member households. Over the past few years, the cooperative's production has greatly developed, and the income of the members and the public accumulation within the cooperative have both increased significantly. By 1955, the total public accumulation fund had reached 60,000 yuan. Due to the increasing need for agricultural production transportation and the large accumulation of public funds, in October, this cooperative submitted a request to the state-owned Transportation Electrical Equipment Company for the supply of a truck, and signed a contract to purchase the truck.
    The purchase of a truck by the "Liaoyuan" Agricultural Production Cooperative shows that with the expansion of agricultural cooperatives, the development of production, and the large accumulation of public funds, it is not only necessary but also possible to purchase modern transportation tools such as trucks. The purchase of a truck by the "Liaoyuan" Agricultural Production Cooperative is the beginning of a good phenomenon. Before long, such things will become more and more common.

    一个好现象的开端
    最近，国营交通电工器材公司晋南分公司就要按照合同，把一部载重两吨的汽车运交山西解虞县王村“燎原”农业生产合作社了。
    “燎原”农业生产合作社有三百户社员。几年来社里的生产有了很大的发展，社员收入和社内公共积累都有了显著增长，到一九五五年公积金总数已达六万元。由于日益频繁的农业生产运输上的需要和公积金的大量积累，十月间这个社向国营交通电工器材公司提出了供应载重汽车的要求，签订了购买汽车的合同。
    “燎原”农业生产合作社购买汽车这件事情，说明了农业合作社的扩大，生产的发展，公积金的大量积累，就不但需要而且也可能购买像载重汽车这样的现代的运输工具了。“燎原”农业生产合作社购买汽车这件事情是一个好现象的开端，不要多久，这样的事情就会越来越多了。
