    Hunan Holds Agricultural Tool and Machinery Exhibition
    Hunan Province has held an agricultural tool and machinery exhibition in Changsha since November 22nd. The exhibition displays more than 1,000 kinds of old-style, improved, and new-style agricultural tools, as well as samples of some agricultural machinery.

    What attracts attention at the exhibition are the improved agricultural tools created by the peasants themselves. There are samples of the sealed waterwheel and windmill water pump created by Yang Xixian, a rural educated youth from Yuanjiang County; the model of the water lifting machine created by Cao Wentao, a rural educated youth from Anhua County; and the sweet potato shredding and slicing dual-purpose machine invented by Chen Benxing, a peasant from Chen County, etc.

    The exhibition also displays a batch of agricultural machines such as tractors, water pumps, and combine harvesters, allowing visitors to see the upcoming prospect of agricultural mechanization in our country.

    Many district committee secretaries, after seeing these new agricultural tools, expressed that they would definitely promote and popularize them vigorously after returning. Many visitors requested local industrial departments to manufacture more and vigorously promote the newly-styled and improved agricultural tools such as rice threshers, sealed waterwheels, and sweet potato shredding machines that have been successfully trial-produced. A young farmer named Zhou Ganming, after visiting the exhibition, wrote in the opinion book: "I was originally not at ease with agricultural production. After seeing many new-style agricultural machines and seeing the happy future of the countryside, I will definitely work in production with peace of mind after returning."

    At this exhibition, the Hunan Provincial Local Industry Department will absorb the opinions of the masses and unify the specifications of new-style agricultural tools for mass production next year. Among them, for the rice thresher alone, more than 75,000 units will be produced next year. (Reported by our correspondent in Changsha)

    湖南举办农具农械展览会
    湖南省从十一月二十二日起，在长沙举办了一个农具、农械展览会。展览会上陈列了一千多种旧式的、经过改良以后的和新式的农具，以及一部分农业机器的样品。
    展览会上引人注目的是农民自己创造的改良农具。这里有沅江县农村知识青年阳希贤创造的密闭式水车和风力抽水机的样品；有安化县农村知识青年曹文韬创造的升水机的模型；有郴县农民陈本杏发明的红薯刨丝、切片两用机等。
    在展览会上，还陈列一批拖拉机、抽水机和联合收割机等农业机器，参观的人们都看到我国即将到来的农业机械化的远景。
    许多区委书记看到这些新农具后，表示回去一定大力宣传和推广。很多参观的人要求地方工业部门，多多制造和大力推广已经试制成功的打稻机、密闭式水车和甘薯刨丝机等新式的和改良的农具。有个叫周干明的青年农民参观了展览会后，在意见簿上写道：“我原来不安心农业生产的，这次看到许多新式的农业机器，看到农村的幸福前途，回去一定安心生产。”
    在这个展览会上，湖南省地方工业部门将吸取群众意见，统一新式农具的规格，在明年大批生产。其中仅打稻机一项，明年就将生产七万五千多台。　（本报驻长沙记者）
