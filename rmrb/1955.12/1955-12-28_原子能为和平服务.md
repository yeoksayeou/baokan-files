Atomic Energy Serving Peace
Soviet Engineer, Bo Antonov

Atomic energy offers all the people of the world new possibilities to progress and to accelerate humanity towards a bright communist future. This is one of mankind’s greatest technological achievements. All peace-loving mankind firmly believes that atomic energy should not become a tool of war and destruction, but should only serve peaceful purposes.

The establishment of the world's first industrial atomic power station is one of the greatest achievements of Soviet science.

June 27, 1954, began an era of broad utilization of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. On this day, the Soviet Union's world's first atomic power station began generating electricity using the energy released by uranium nuclear fission. More than a year has passed since then. Connected to high-voltage circuits, the atomic power station has supplied the surrounding cities, rural areas, and workers' towns with more than fifteen million kilowatt-hours of electricity.

The Atomic Energy Power Station of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is housed in a not-very-large three-story building. Inside this building, we do not hear the sounds of the fire chamber and the noise of fueling machinery, nor do we see raging flames. We cannot even find a trace of smoke or coal ash on the hands and clothes of the power station staff. In each room, we encounter something new, unique, and extraordinary.

The main hall is a tall and bright room. In one corner of the hall, a small area is surrounded by fine chains. Inside the enclosure is the iron upper guard plate and steel dome covering the reactor—the atomic boiler.

The reactor is the main mechanism of the atomic power station. Inside the reactor, the energy in the uranium nucleus is transformed into useful thermal energy, which will then be used to drive a steam turbine generator with a generating capacity of five thousand kilowatts. The nominal thermal power of the reactor is thirty thousand kilowatts.

Enriched uranium containing five percent uranium-235 is the "fuel" of the power station's reactor. The reactor contains a total of about five hundred and fifty kilograms of this enriched uranium. The power station consumes only thirty centimeters of uranium-235 per day. In contrast, a thermal power station with the same generating capacity would burn about one hundred tons of coal per day.

Why is the efficiency of an atomic power station using uranium so much higher than that of a thermal power station using coal, oil, or peat?

When we burn coal, oil, or peat in the fire chamber of a steam boiler in a thermal power station, we are using the energy of the chemical reaction of fuel oxidation. In this reaction process, the atoms of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen remain unchanged, and although new molecules are formed, only the outermost "surface" layer of the atoms, its electron shell, participates in the change.

The center of the atom of any chemical element has a very small atomic nucleus. The entire mass of the atom is actually concentrated in the nucleus. The atomic nucleus always carries a positive charge, and negatively charged electrons constantly move around the nucleus. The electrons are distributed in layers around the nucleus, forming the electron shell. The atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Protons are the nuclei of hydrogen atoms. They carry a positive charge, and their mass is one thousand eight hundred and forty times the mass of an electron. Neutrons are uncharged particles, and their mass is slightly greater than the mass of a proton. Protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus are very strongly linked to each other by a special force called nuclear force. Once this force ceases to function, the protons that make up the atomic nucleus—particles with the same charge—will scatter in different directions. It is precisely because of this enormous nuclear force that the atomic nucleus can become a source of enormous energy. One only needs to be able to liberate this force.

Part of the energy stored in the atomic nucleus can be extracted as long as the so-called nuclear reaction is realized. The participants in this reaction are not atoms but the nuclei of atoms. Due to the interaction of nuclei and particles, a fundamental reorganization of matter occurs, touching its interior and releasing large amounts of energy in some cases. However, far from all nuclear reactions release energy simultaneously. In addition, since both the atomic nucleus and the particles that cause the nuclear reaction are very small, it is usually difficult to achieve a nuclear reaction.

In the atomic boiler—the reactor—a special chain reaction is used, which causes the fission of uranium-235 atoms under the action of neutrons. Once this reaction begins due to the automatic fission characteristics of the uranium nucleus, it can continue uninterrupted under certain conditions. Each uranium nucleus splits into two parts under the action of an intruding neutron, and when it splits, it releases several neutrons, and each newly formed neutron causes the fission of other uranium nuclei, continuing to expand. This uninterrupted chain process requires a certain number of uranium nuclei, because if the number of uranium nuclei is too small, many of the neutrons produced during fission will not encounter uranium nuclei when flying through the uranium block, and will fly out of the uranium block and be lost. The amount of uranium necessary to initiate the development of a chain reaction is called the critical mass. In the reactor of an atomic power station, the critical mass for the reactor to operate is about two hundred and fifty kilograms of enriched uranium. However, the actual amount of uranium loaded in the reactor exceeds this number by more than double. This is necessary to ensure that the reactor has sufficient radioactivity reserves, that is to say, that the reactor can operate for a long time, despite the obstructive effects of the uranium fission products and the xenon gas formed during the reactor's operation.

In order for the chain reaction to proceed smoothly, neutrons with low kinetic energy are required. Therefore, it is necessary to artificially reduce the kinetic energy of the neutrons formed during the fission of uranium-235 nuclei. The operating rods of the reactor are surrounded by graphite for this purpose. The water that cools the reactor also performs the function of reducing the kinetic energy of the neutrons.

The structure of the atomic power station reactor is a steel cylindrical sleeve installed on a concrete foundation. The sleeve is filled with graphite. The central part of the graphite is inserted with one hundred and twenty-eight operating rods, each of which is a long cylindrical tube about seven meters long. These cylinders are loaded with uranium at the bottom. It is this welded part that emits heat when the reactor is working.

In the process of the chain reaction of uranium-235 nuclear fission in the reactor, each fission of the uranium-235 nucleus forms two "fragments" (that is, two new atomic nuclei whose mass is much smaller than the mass of the uranium nucleus), and also ejects some neutrons and emits strong gamma radiation. As we have already pointed out, the neutrons mainly keep the chain reaction going. The fragments, on the other hand, scatter and collide with other atoms, transferring a certain acceleration to other atoms, and the heat-releasing part of the uranium thus becomes hot. This heat is also drawn out by the water circulating in each operating rod of the reactor at a pressure of one hundred atmospheres.

The water passing through the reactor is heated to two hundred and seventy degrees, but it does not boil because it is under a pressure of one hundred atmospheres. The water circulates in a closed circuit called the first loop. The water in the first loop boils the water in the second loop in the steam generator, and the pressure in the second loop is already twelve and a half atmospheres. Here, steam with a temperature of two hundred and sixty degrees has been formed, and the steam thus enters the turbine. The steam turbine using "atomic heat" drives the ordinary generator. The current generated by the generator enters the step-up transformer substation connected to the high-voltage circuit.

In order to control the operation of the reactor, a complete set of boron carbide control rods, automatic control rods, and emergency protection rods are provided. The effectiveness of these rods is based on the principle that boron and certain other substances can very powerfully absorb neutrons. By inserting or extracting these rods into or from the active area, the operation of the reactor can be easily affected.

The entire management process of the atomic power station reactor is automatic. The duty engineer at the central control panel controls all the machinery of the power station. The power of the reactor that he specifies is automatically executed by specialized instruments. At any moment, he can check the condition of each unit of the atomic power station.

This is only the starting point of the glorious path of Soviet atomic dynamics. Now, the Soviet Union is designing atomic power stations with a power of 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts and even larger. The development of atomic dynamics is one of the conditions for the technological progress of the Soviet socialist state.

II

Atomic dynamics is not the only way to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

The emergence of nuclear reactors, as well as the emergence of improved charged particle accelerators, has made it possible to produce radioactive isotopes in large quantities. The adoption of these radioactive isotopes in many sectors of the national economy shows that they are very useful in solving a large number of practical problems, and are therefore very promising.

As everyone knows, isotopes are variants of the atoms of a certain chemical element. The chemical properties of an isotope of an element are actually indistinguishable from those of that element, so they occupy the same position as that element in Mendeleev's periodic table of elements. That is to say, the atomic nuclei of all isotopes of a certain element contain the same number of positively charged particles—protons. Isotopes differ from each other only in the number of neutrons in the atomic nucleus, and therefore several isotopes of an element are distinguished by different atomic weights and other several properties. Among these properties, the most important is radioactivity, or more precisely, the distinctly unique characteristics of the process of radioactive decay. The process of radioactive decay is what we see on every radioactive isotope. The different properties of the atomic nuclei of each isotope (unstable, radioactive, and stable) allow us to use isotopes as "tracer atoms." The "trace" of radioactive isotopes is their radioactive radiation, and the "trace" of non-radioactive isotopes is their atomic weight. Using a special instrument, it is possible to determine the atomic weight and radioactive radiation characteristics of a certain isotope, and to determine the smallest quantity of a certain isotope in a mixture, among many other isotopes.

Isotopes are also widely used as sources of radioactive radiation—mainly gamma rays. Isotopes such as cobalt-60 have now almost completely ousted the use of expensive radium.

The main isotopes used by the national economy are made with nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors are also used as extremely powerful sources of neutrons and gamma rays. In the thick layers of the concrete protective wall surrounding the reactor, special pipes are installed, in which various substances are placed for radiation neutrons and gamma rays. When the reactor is in operation, this nuclear radiation emerges from the active area of the reactor like a giant stream. Neutrons and gamma rays act on the atomic nuclei of the substances irradiated in the reactor and cause them to undergo profound changes. As a result of these nuclear reactions, new atomic nuclei are produced, creating other chemical elements.

However, in addition to the nuclear reactions we want, many other reactions also occur in the substance irradiated by neutrons. Therefore, the task of separating isotopes becomes complicated.

All the work of chemically separating the desired isotope from the irradiated sample is carried out in specially equipped "hot" laboratories. They are called "hot" laboratories because they contain strongly radioactive, special "hot" substances. The activity of the processed substances here reaches the equivalent of several kilograms of radium.

Here, completely new technologies have emerged as needed. In the "hot" laboratory, all operations are remote. The operator is in a room away from the original concrete wall where the active sample being processed is placed. Sensitive "mechanical hands"—manipulators managed by the operator—accurately perform all the necessary actions inside the "hot" room: moving parts, managing the work of machine tools and various machines, etc. The entire process taking place in the room can be continuously observed on the screen of the television or with a set of mirrors. During the entire technological cycle, the human hand never touches the highly radioactive isotope. Everything is done by complex, "smart" machines. In the Soviet Union, various instruments based on the use of various properties of radioactive isotopes are being used more and more widely. These new instruments can improve technological processes and automate those production tasks that previously seemed unsuitable for automation.

Now, take the gamma-ray soil meter as an example. The powerful dredgers used in the construction of our country's largest hydroelectric power station are equipped with this instrument. The dredger uses a powerful pumping device to suck the slurry—a mixture of water and soil—into the pipeline, and the slurry flows along the pipeline from the dredger to the place where the dam of the hydroelectric power station is being built. The water flows away, and the soil remains in place. As the slurry flows, the embankment becomes higher and higher. It is clear that the thinner the slurry, the slower the embankment will be deposited. However, if the slurry is very thick, it will be difficult to flow in the pipeline, and blockages will often occur in the pipeline. In this way, its productivity will be reduced. The use of a gamma-ray soil meter can greatly improve the quality of the dredger's work.

The radioactive isotope is placed on one side of the dredger's pipeline, and the recording instrument (counter) is placed on the other side. The thicker the slurry, the more it hinders and absorbs gamma rays, and the fewer counts the recording device records. With this lightweight instrument, it is easy to determine where the dredger's pipeline is blocked by mud. With this instrument, the entire process of using the dredger to deposit the dam can be automated.

Instruments for continuously measuring the thickness of steel in the metallurgical industry, instruments for measuring the density of cotton slivers in the textile industry, meters for measuring the level of liquids and liquid metals in closed containers, automatic devices that control this level to a predetermined size, density meters, counters for objects on conveyor belts, etc., are also based on the use of the penetrating nature of nuclear radiation.

The penetrating properties of the radiation of various isotopes are also used to check for defects. Our country produces standard gamma-ray flaw detectors, which can quickly and effectively "radiographically inspect" machine parts, rails, welds, etc., and accurately determine the internal defects of a certain product. This reduces waste and helps to better organize production.

Radioactive isotopes of iron, sulfur, tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, and silicon are used to study various metallurgical processes—to study the distribution of impurities in steel ingots, to determine the causes of impurities in metals, to determine the flow rate of steel and slag in open hearth furnace baths, and to monitor the state of refractory materials in blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces. Radioactive methods are also widely used in the exploration of mineral deposits (especially oil).

Soviet scientists add radioactive isotopes to the material of the tool, which enables them to study the wear process of the tool in detail and propose suggestions for improving the metal cutting regulations. With radioactive isotopes, it is also possible to study the wear process of various parts of the engine and the impact of various external factors (such as dust in the air) on wear.

In medicine, radioactive isotopes are used to treat various tumors by irradiation, and are also used to diagnose thyroid diseases and determine the speed of blood flow in the human body.

The use of radioactive isotopes as "tracer" atoms has been widely used in biology. Radioactive isotopes of phosphorus, which enter the organism along with water or nutrients, behave in the same way as ordinary, non-radioactive phosphorus in the organism. By observing the movement of radioactive phosphorus in plants and animal organisms with recording equipment, Soviet scientists have obtained many important results and clarified the functions of various physiological processes occurring in biological organisms. For example, it has been determined by this method that there are many continuous biochemical processes of destruction and generation of the chemical substances that make up the brain in the brain of animals.

With the help of isotopes, the significance of foliar fertilization for increasing yield has also been determined.

These are just a few examples of the use of radioactive isotopes in the national economy and for improving the welfare of the people.

The Soviet people are working every day for peace and happiness throughout the world. Their achievements in this noble cause are a guarantee of the progress and prosperity of the peace-loving people of all countries. The achievements of Soviet scientists in the peaceful use of atomic energy are accelerating the progress of science and technology in other countries and helping the people of these countries in their struggle for peace and for socialism.

× × ×

Soviet scientists are further improving methods for using atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

The main task of modern physics is to understand the nature of nuclear force and to reveal the laws of atomic nucleus structure. Soviet scientists are making unremitting efforts to solve these most important tasks.

One of the most powerful technological devices for studying atomic nucleus structure and nuclear force is the charged particle accelerator.

The Soviet state constantly cares for supplying Soviet physics research institutes with modern equipment—including accelerators.

At the Institute of Nuclear Problems of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the world's largest synchrocyclotron has been working for more than five years. It can make accelerated protons carry an energy of 680 million electron volts. A more powerful, the world's largest synchrophasotron, is currently being manufactured, from which protons with an energy of 10 billion electron volts will be obtained.

There is no doubt that Soviet physicists, who possess all the necessary technical tools and are guided by the Marxist dialectical method, will reveal the secrets of atomic nucleus structure and will be able to find new ways to use the inexhaustible reserves of energy inside the atomic nucleus for the benefit of all mankind.

    原子能为和平服务
    苏联工程师　柏·安东诺夫
    原子能给全世界人民提供了使他们进步、使全人类加速向光辉灿烂的共产主义未来迈进的新的可能，这是人类最伟大的技术成就之一。全体爱好和平的人类都坚决认为，原子能不应当成为战争和破坏的工具，只应当为和平的目的服务。一
    世界上第一个工业用原子能发电站的建立是苏联科学的最大成就之一。
    一九五四年六月二十七日开始了一个为和平目的广泛利用原子能的时代。在这一天，苏联的世界上第一个原子能发电站依靠铀核分裂放出的能量开始发电了。从那时起已经过去了一年多。连接着高压电路的原子能发电站已经给周围的城市、农村和工人镇送出了比一千五百万度多得多的电力。
    苏联科学院原子能发电站在一座并不很大的三层建筑物里面。在这个建筑物里面，我们听不见火室的响声和添燃料的机械的噪音，看不见熊熊的火焰。我们在发电站工作人员的手上和衣服上甚至发现不了一点烟子或煤灰的痕迹。在每个房间里我们都遇到某种新的、独特的、异乎寻常的事物。
    主厅是一个高大而明亮的房间。厅的一角是用细链围绕起来的一小块地方。在围栅的里面，是盖在反应堆——原子锅炉上面的铁质上层护板和钢质圆顶。
    反应堆是原子能发电站的主要机构。在反应堆里面，铀核内能量变为有用的热能，随后将利用这些热能来开动发电功率为五千瓩的汽轮发电机。反应堆名义上的热功率为三万瓩。
    含有百分之五的铀二三五的浓缩铀是发电站反应堆的“燃料”。反应堆中总共放有约五百五十公斤这种浓缩铀。发电站工作一昼夜仅消耗三十公分的铀二三五。而在具有同样发电功率的火力发电站，一昼夜的工作就得燃用约一百吨煤。
    为什么原子能发电站用铀比火力发电站用煤、石油、泥炭有这样高的效率呢？
    当我们在火力发电站蒸汽锅炉的火室中燃烧煤、石油或泥炭的时候，是利用燃料氧化的化学反应能。在这种反应过程中，碳、氧、氢的原子仍然不变，虽然组成新的分子，但参加变化的仅仅是原子中实物的最外边的“表面”层，也就是它的电子外壳。
    任何一种化学元素的原子的中心都有一个非常小的原子核。原子的全部质量实际上是集中在核里面。原子核总是带有正电荷，带负电荷的电子经常地绕着核运动。电子一层层地布在核的周围，就这样形成了电子外壳。原子核是由质子和中子构成的。质子就是氢原子的核。它们带有正电荷，它们的质量是电子质量的一千八百四十倍。中子是不带电荷的粒子，中子的质量稍大于质子的质量。在原子核里的质子和中子依靠一种叫做核子力的特殊力量的作用而非常牢固地互相联系着。一旦这种力量不起作用，那末构成原子核的质子——带有同样电荷的粒子就会向不同的方向飞散。原子核正是由于具有这种巨大的核子力，才能成为巨大能量的源泉。只是必须能够把这种力量解放出来。
    只要实现了所谓原子核反应，就能取出储藏在原子核中的部分能量。参与这种反应的，不是原子而是原子的核。由于核和粒子的互相作用，就产生了物质的根本改组，触到了它的内部，并在某种情况下把大量的能解放出来。可是，远远不是一切核反应都同时放出能量。此外，由于原子核和引起核反应的粒子都非常微小，实现核反应通常是很困难的。
    在原子锅炉——反应堆里面，是利用一种特殊的、在中子作用下引起铀二三五原子核分裂的链式反应。这种反应由于铀核的自动分裂的特性而开始以后，在某种条件下可以不间断地继续下去。每个铀核在冲进去的中子的作用下都分裂为两部分，并且在它分裂时放出若干中子，而每个新生的中子又引起其他铀核的分裂，这样继续扩展下去。这种不间断的链式过程，要求具有一定数量的铀核，因为，如果铀核数量太少，那末，在分裂时出现的中子，将有很多在飞穿铀块时不能与铀核相遇，结果就飞出铀块而损失掉。为开始发展链式反应所必需的铀的数量，叫做临界质量。在原子能发电站的反应堆中，担负反应堆工作的临界质量约达二百五十公斤的浓缩铀。但是，反应堆实际装载的铀却超过这个数目一倍多。为了使反应堆有足够的放射性储备，这样做是必要的，也就是说，这样一来，虽然有铀分裂的产物和在反应堆工作过程中形成的氙气的妨碍作用，反应堆还是能够长时期的工作。
    为了使链式反应能够顺利进行，就必须有运动速度不大的中子。因此，不得不人工地降低在铀二三五核分裂时形成的中子的运动速度。反应堆的工作杆就是为了这个目的而用石墨包围起来的。使反应堆冷却的水也执行着减低中子运动速度的职能。
    原子能发电站的反应堆的构造是一个设置在混凝土基础上的钢质圆柱形套筒。套筒内砌满了石墨。石墨的中央部分插着一百二十八根工作杆，每个杆都是长约七公尺的长条圆筒。这些圆筒的下部装着铀。反应堆工作时，也就是在焊的这个部分发出热的。
    在反应堆中进行铀二三五核分裂的链式反应的过程中，铀二三五核的每次分裂都形成两个“碎片”
  （即两个新的原子核，它们的质量比铀核的质量小得多），同时也飞出一些中子和放出强烈的丙种辐射。正如我们已指出的，中子主要是使链式反应维持下去。而碎片则飞散开来，与其他的原子相撞，并把一定的加速传给其他原子，铀的放热部分由于这样而发热。这种热还由反应堆的每个工作杆中在一百大气压下环流不息的水引出来。
    通过反应堆的水被加热到二百七十度，但是并不沸腾，因为它是处在一百大气压的压力下。水在叫做第一回路的闭路内循环。第一回路的水在蒸汽发生器中使第二回路的水沸腾，第二回路中的压力已经是十二点五大气压。这里已经形成了温度达到二百六十度的蒸汽，蒸汽就这样进入涡轮机。使用“原子热量”的蒸汽涡轮机推动平常的发电机。发电机发出的电流进入和高压电路相连的升压变电所。
    为了控制反应堆的工作，备有整套的碳化硼调节棒、自动调节棒和紧急保护棒。这些棒的效用是基于下列原理：硼和其他某些物质能够极有力地吸收中子。把这些棒伸入或抽出活泼区域，就能很容易地影响反应堆的工作。
    原子能发电站反应堆的全部管理过程都是自动的。在中央操纵台旁的值班工程师操纵着发电站所有的机械。他所规定的反应堆的功率由专门的仪器自动执行。在任何时刻他都能检查原子能发电站每个机组的情况。
    这里不过是苏联原子动力学的光荣道路的起点。现在苏联正在设计功率为五万到十万瓩以及更大的原子能发电站。原子动力学的发展是苏维埃社会主义国家技术进步的条件之一。
      二
    原子动力学并不是把原子能用于和平目的的唯一道路。
    核子反应堆的出现，此外还有完善的带电粒子加速器的出现，促使大量生产放射性同位素成为可能。在国民经济许多部门中对这些放射性同位素的采用表明，它们在解决许许多多实际问题时是很有用的，因而也是有远大前途的。
    大家知道，同位素是某一种化学元素的原子的变种。一种元素的同位素的化学性质实际上同这种元素是没有区别的，因此它们在门德列耶夫的元素周期表中和该元素占同一个位置。这就是说，某一种元素的所有同位素的原子核都含有数目相同的带正电的粒子——质子。同位素彼此之间的区别只是原子核内的中子的数目不同，因此，一种元素的几种同位素是由原子量大小不同和其他几种性质的不同来区别的。这些性质之中最重要的是放射性，说得确切些，是放射性衰变过程的特点的鲜明的独具的特性。而放射性衰变过程是我们在每一种放射性同位素上都会看到的。每一种同位素的原子核有着不同的性质（不稳定的、放射性的和稳定的），这就使我们可以用同位素当作“示踪原子”使用。放射性同位素的这种“踪迹”是它们的放射性辐射，而非放射性的同位素的“踪迹”是它们的原子量。利用一种特殊的仪器可以确定某一种同位素的原子量和放射性辐射的特性，并可以确定某一种同位素在混合物里，在许多其他同位素中的最小数量。
    同位素也作为放射性辐射的源泉——主要是丙种射线——而获得广泛的应用。像钴六十这种同位素，现在几乎已经完全排挤掉昂贵的镭的应用了。
    国民经济所应用的主要同位素，是用核子反应堆造出来的。核子反应堆还用来做为中子和丙种射线的极强大的源泉。在围绕着反应堆的混凝土保护壁的厚层中，设置有特殊的管道，其中放有为辐射中子和丙种射线用的各种物质。在反应堆起作用时，这种核子辐射像巨流一样从反应堆的活泼区域出来。中子和丙种射线作用于反应堆中受到辐射的物质的原子核，并引起它们深刻变化。这些核子反应的结果就产生新的原子核，造出其他的化学元素。
    但是，除去我们所希望的核子反应以外，在受到中子辐射的物质中也发生许多其他反应。因此，分离同位素的任务就复杂起来了。
    从受到辐射的样品化学分离所希望得到的同位素的全部工作，是在专门为此而设备的“热”实验室内进行的。所以称它们为“热”实验室，是因为其中有放射性强的、特种“热”物质在起作用。这儿被加工的物质的活动性达到相当于数公斤镭那么大。
    在这里，因需要而产生了完全新的技术。在
  “热”实验室内一切操作都是远距离的。操作的人是在离开放有被加工的活动样品的原混凝土墙壁的屋子的地方。灵敏的“机器手”——操纵者所管理的操纵器——在“热”室内部准确地进行着一切必需的动作：移动零件、管理机床和各种机器的工作等。经电视器的映幕上或者利用一组反射镜可以不断地观察室内进行着的全部过程。在整个工艺循环过程中，人的手一次都不用触到辐射力很强的同位素。一切都由复杂的、“聪明的”机器来做。在苏联，以应用放射性同位素的各种性质为基础的各种仪器，应用得日益广泛了。这些新仪器能改善工艺过程并使过去看起来不宜于自动化的那些生产工作也自动化起来。
    现在拿丙种射线泥土测量器作例子。在我国最大的水电站的建设工程中用的强大的吸泥机，就装备有这种仪器。吸泥机用强大的唧筒装置把泥浆——水同土的混合物——吸到管道里来，泥浆沿管道由吸泥机流到建筑水电站拦河坝的地方。水流走，而土留在原地。随着泥浆的流到，土堤愈来愈高。很清楚，泥浆愈稀，这个土堤也就冲积得愈慢。但是，如果泥浆很稠，那末它在管道里的流动就会困难，管道里就要时常发生阻塞。这样一来它的生产率就要降低。采用丙种射线泥土测量器可以大大改善吸泥机的工作质量。
    放射性同位素放在吸泥机管道的一方，记录仪器（计数器）放在对方。泥浆愈浓，它就阻滞，吸收丙种射线愈多，记录装置所记出的数目也就愈少。利用这种轻便仪器，可以容易地确定吸泥机管道被泥阻塞的地方。有了这种仪器就能使用吸泥机冲积拦河坝工作的全部过程自动化。
    在冶金工业中用来不断测量钢材的厚度的仪器，在纺织工业中测量棉条的密度的仪器，在封闭着的容器内液体和液体金属的水平面的测量器，把这种水平面控制在预定的大小的自动装置，密度的测量器，输送带上的物件的计数器等等，也都是以利用核子辐射的穿透性为基础的。
    各种同位素的幅射的穿透性质，还被利用来检查缺陷。我国生产有标准丙种射线探伤仪，它可以迅速而有效地“透视检查”机器零件、铁轨、焊缝等并准确地判断某一制品的内部缺陷。这就降低废品并有助于更好地组织生产。
    铁、硫、钨、钼、铬、矽的放射性同位素被用来研究各种不同的冶金过程——研究钢锭里的杂质的分布情况，断定金属含有杂质的原因，确定钢和熔渣在平炉的浴槽中的流动速度，控制高炉和平炉里耐火材料的状态等。在勘探矿藏（特别是石油）时，也广泛利用放射性方法。
    苏联科学家把放射性同位素加到刀具的材料中，就能够详细地研究刀具的磨损过程，并提出改进金属切削规程的建议。用放射性同位素，也可研究发动机的各种零件的磨损过程和各种外部因素
  （如空气中的尘土）对磨损造成的影响。
    在医学上，用放射性同位素通过照射方法来医治各种肿瘤，也用来诊断甲状腺的病症，确定人的机体内血液流动的速度。
    把放射性同位素作为“示踪”原子，在生物学中获得了广泛的应用。同水或营养物质一道进入生物体内的磷的放射性同位素，在生物体内的活动和普通的、不带放射性的磷是一样的。在利用记录设备来观察放射性磷在植物和动物机体内的移动时，苏联科学家得到了许多重要成果，阐明了生物机体中所进行的各种不同的生理过程的机能。例如，用这种方法曾经确定，在动物的大脑中进行着许多组成大脑的化学物质的破坏和发生的不断的生物化学过程。
    借助于同位素，也确定了植物的根外追肥对于提高产量的意义。
    这里只是举出了在国民经济中和为了提高人民的福利而利用放射性同位素的几个例子。
    苏联人每天都在为全世界的和平和幸福而工作着。他们在这项高尚的事业中的成就，是各国爱好和平的人民进步和繁荣的保证。苏联科学家在和平利用原子能方面的成就，加快着其他国家的科学和技术的进步，有助于这些国家的人民争取和平、争取社会主义的斗争。
              ×　　×　　×
    苏联科学家正在进一步改善利用原子能于和平目的的方法。
    现代物理学的主要任务是认识核子力的本性，揭露原子核构造的规律。苏联科学家正在不屈不挠地努力解决这些最重要的任务。
    研究原子核构造和核子力的最有力的技术设备之一，就是带电粒子加速器。
    苏维埃国家经常关怀着以现代装备——其中也包括加速器——来供给苏联的各物理研究所。
    在苏联科学院核子问题研究所，世界上最大的同步回旋加速器已经工作了五年多了。它可以使被加速了的质子带有六亿八千万电子伏特的能量。目前正在制造着更强大的、世界上最大的同步定相加速器，从这种加速器将得到能量达一百亿电子伏特的质子。
    毫无疑问，拥有一切必需的技术工具的苏联物理学家，以马克思主义的辩证方法为指南，一定会揭露原子核构造的秘密，并能找到利用原子核内部能量的取之不竭的储备为全人类谋福利的新途径。
