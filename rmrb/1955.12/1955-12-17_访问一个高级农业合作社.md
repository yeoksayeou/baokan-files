    Visiting an Advanced Agricultural Cooperative
    Shi Wei
    In the office of the Yuanda Agricultural Production Cooperative, guests come and go in an endless stream. Some come to order Chinese cabbage, some to sell sorghum stalks, and some are sent by government organizations to negotiate visits for their staff. The cooperative's cadres diligently receive all visitors. A middle-aged man filling out a form pointed to a small booklet in front of him and said to the person selling sorghum stalks: Look, our cooperative has expanded again, and the vegetable fields will increase next year. Bring us good goods!
    The Yuanda Cooperative is an agricultural cooperative mainly engaged in vegetable production. When it was established in the winter of 1953, it was decided that land and labor would be distributed at a ratio of 30/70. In 1954, due to the collective operation expanding the vegetable planting area, the income of cooperative members generally increased compared to when they worked individually. In order to further develop production, after detailed discussion, all cooperative members unanimously agreed to abolish land dividends and switch to an advanced cooperative that was based entirely on labor remuneration. At the same time, the number of cooperative members also increased from the original 30 households to 185 households.
    After switching to an advanced cooperative and abolishing land dividends, some cooperative members' reliance on land was eliminated. Coupled with the implementation of contracted work with output quotas and over-production rewards, the cooperative members' enthusiasm for production generally increased, and labor efficiency also significantly improved. Cooperative member Han Yunlong used to take days off every now and then because the land could yield some dividends. This year, with no land dividends and no dependence, he actively participated in the cooperative's labor, earning more than 60 more workdays than last year, which translates to an additional income of more than 120 yuan. Many women who did not often work in the fields in the past have also taken the initiative to ask the team leader for work this year. The attendance rate of women in the entire cooperative has increased by about 20% compared to last year. Zhang Yuhe, who did not often work in the fields in the past, also earned more than 220 workdays this year, catching up with an ordinary male laborer. With the active efforts of all cooperative members, the production of the Yuanda Cooperative has greatly developed in the past year: the number of sunny greenhouses has increased from 250 to 400, the area of fine vegetables has expanded from 150 mu to 300 mu, and 80 mu of reed marshland has been developed into paddy fields. These lands had never grown a single crop in the past, but this year, in the 50 mu of land they developed in the spring, the average yield was 750 jin of rice per mu.
    In the first year that the Yuanda Cooperative switched to an advanced cooperative, although the number of new cooperative member households exceeded the number of old cooperative member households by more than five times and it also suffered from some floods, the average income per household was still more than 700 yuan after preliminary calculations. Among the old cooperative members, the income of ten poor peasant households, except for one whose income decreased due to illness, all increased by more than double compared to when they worked individually. Among the twenty middle peasant households, only the income of one well-to-do household was the same as when they worked individually, while the income of other middle peasants increased by more than 60%. The income of all new cooperative members, regardless of their labor strength, increased compared to when they worked individually, generally increasing by more than 50%.
    The issues that people are most concerned about, the lives of the elderly, widowed, and weak households, have also been satisfactorily resolved because they have been given appropriate tasks. The ten elderly and weak households in the entire cooperative generally have incomes of 300 to 400 yuan. Shao Huangshi, 58 years old, used to cultivate three or four mu on her own, and could only weed small seedlings. She had to hire people to do other work, and her annual income was 70 to 80 yuan, which was not even enough to pay agricultural taxes. This year, after joining the cooperative, the cooperative assigned her light work such as weeding, planting garlic, and tying cucumbers, totaling more than 1,500 work points, which will earn her more than 300 yuan. Recently, the cooperative also admitted Dong Sheng, a disabled poor peasant household. Dong Sheng is already an old man in his sixties. When he was young, he drove a cart for a landlord and crushed his foot. Now he can only crawl to hoe the ground. His family also has a disabled old wife who needs him to cook for her, and their life is very difficult. After joining the cooperative, he was assigned some light work to do. It is estimated that he will still be short of four months' worth of grain, which will be subsidized by the cooperative.
    The Yuanda Agricultural Production Cooperative is located in Dongran Village Township in the western suburbs of Beijing. In addition to the Yuanda Cooperative, there are also the Sijiqing and Jinzhuang cooperatives in this township. Although the land of each cooperative is used in a unified way, the land of the three cooperatives is intertwined, making cultivation, especially mechanized cultivation, very inconvenient. In order to solve this contradiction, the three cooperatives have merged. After the merger of the three cooperatives, there are a total of 400 cooperative members' households, and with the newly joined cooperative members, there are about 600 households in total. There are only about ten farmers in the entire township who have not joined the cooperative. Now the preparatory committee of the new cooperative has been formed. In addition to dealing with the expansion of the cooperative, such as pricing draft cattle, they are also starting to plan for future production. The preliminary plan is to develop more than 100 mu of paddy fields next year, and to determine the number of vegetable fields to be expanded based on the amount of labor. New and old cooperative members have begun to intensively accumulate fertilizer and organize winter production activities such as preparing vegetable fields. The newly opened coal briquette processing plant and flour mill have also begun production. The cooperative members are full of confidence and are working hard to achieve greater success next year.

    访问一个高级农业合作社
    施维
    远大农业生产合作社的办公室里，接洽工作的客人络绎不绝。他们有的来订购大白菜，有的来推销高粱秸，还有些是机关团体派来交涉工作人员参观的事情。合作社的干部们勤快地接待了所有的来人。一个正在填写表格的中年人，指着面前一本小册子对推销高粱秸的人说：看，咱们社又扩大了，明年菜地还要增加，你有好货尽管送来吧！
    远大社是一个以生产蔬菜为主的农业合作社，一九五三年冬建立的时候，确定土地和劳力按三七比例分红。一九五四年，由于集体经营扩大了蔬菜种植面积，社员收入比单干的时候普遍增加。为了进一步发展生产，经过详细讨论，全体社员一致同意取消土地分红，改为完全按劳取酬的高级社。同时，社员也从原来的三十户扩大到一百八十五户。
    转成高级社取消土地分红以后，有些社员依赖土地的思想消除了，又加上实行包工包产、超产奖励的办法，社员的生产积极性普遍高涨，劳动效率也显著提高。社员韩云龙去年因土地能分点红，三天两头歇工，今年土地不分红，没有依赖了，便积极参加社里的劳动，比去年多得了六十多个劳动日，可多收入一百二十多元。很多过去不常下地的妇女，今年也都主动找队长要活干，全社妇女出勤率约比去年提高百分之二十。张玉和过去是不经常下地的，今年也得了二百二十多个劳动日，赶上一个普通男劳动力。在全体社员积极努力下，一年来远大社的生产有了很大发展：阳畦从二百五十个增加到四百个，细菜从一百五十亩扩大到三百亩，还把八十亩苇塘洼地开发成稻地，这些地，过去多少年来一棵庄稼也没长过，今年在他们春季开发的五十亩地里，每亩平均收了七百五十斤稻谷。
    远大社转为高级社的第一年中，虽然新社员户数超过了老社员户数五倍以上，又遭受了一些水灾，但是经过初步试算，每户平均收入还在七百元以上。老社员中，十户贫农的收入除了一户因病减少外，其余都比单干的时候增加一倍以上，二十户中农只有一户富裕户的收入和单干时相等，别的中农都增加了百分之六十以上的收入。新社员不论劳力强弱，户户收入都比单干时增加，一般都增加了百分之五十以上。
    人们最关心的孤寡老弱户，也都因为得到适当活茬而圆满地解决了生活问题。全社十户老弱户，一般都能有三、四百元的收入。五十八岁的邵黄氏，过去单干种三、四亩，自己只能锄小苗，别的活都要雇人做，每年收入七、八十元，连农业税也缴不起，今年入了社，社里分配她薅草、栽蒜、捆黄瓜等轻活，共做一千五百多个工分，能分得三百多元。最近社里又把一户有残疾的贫农董生吸收入了社。董生已经是六十多岁的老头儿，壮年的时候替地主赶车压坏了脚，现在只能爬着锄地，家里还有一个残废的老伴，要做饭给她吃，生活十分困苦。入社后分配些轻活给他做，估计还要缺四个月的粮，将要由社里补助。
    远大农业生产合作社在北京西郊的东冉村乡，这个乡除远大社外还有四季青和金庄两个社。每个社的土地虽然都是统一使用的，但是三个社的土地又互相交错，耕种特别是机器耕作很不方便。他们为了解决这个矛盾，三个社已经实行合并。三个社合并后共有社员四百户，连新入社的社员共约六百户，全乡未入社的农民只有十来户了。现在新社的筹备委员会已经组成，他们除了处理耕牛作价等等扩社问题外，并着手进行今后的生产规划。初步计划明年将再开发稻地一百多亩，并且根据劳动力的多寡确定扩大菜地的数字。新老社员们已开始紧张的积肥，整理菜地等冬季生产活动，新开办的煤球加工厂和粉坊也开始了生产。社员们都信心十足地努力争取明年获得更大的成就。
