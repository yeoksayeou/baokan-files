Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Newspapers from Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and the German Democratic Republic warmly welcomed the joint statement of Bulganin, Khrushchev, and Nehru.

    The Polish "People's Tribune" editorial stated that the significance of the joint statement of Bulganin, Khrushchev, and Nehru far exceeded the borders of India and the Soviet Union. The "Geneva spirit," hated by the Western bloc, has gained new material strength and encouragement from Delhi. The combination of the "Geneva spirit" and the "Bandung spirit" has greatly reduced the territory of the "Cold War."
    The Hungarian "People's Voice" editorial stated that the Soviet-Indian joint statement "reflects the common views of the Soviet and Indian governments on important international issues." "The Soviet Union and India are models of peaceful coexistence, and they jointly oppose the policies of preparing for war, expanding armaments, and opposing colonialism and racial discrimination."
    The Romanian "Spark" editorial stated that the friendly cooperative relations between the Soviet Union and India in the struggle to defend peace are of indelible significance. The Romanian people heartily congratulate the consolidation of Soviet-Indian friendly cooperation, believing it to be a great contribution to the cause of universal peace.
    The Bulgarian "Labor" newspaper, in its editorial, emphasized the great significance of the agreement reached by the Soviet and Indian leaders in further consolidating peace in Asia and the world.
    The German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" said that the joint Soviet-Indian statement once again pointed out that the basis of international relations should be the Five Principles of Coexistence, and that all efforts must continue to be made to ease international tensions and promote the cause of peace and cooperation between countries.

    人民民主国家报纸欢迎苏印联合声明
    新华社十六日讯  波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和德意志民主共和国的报纸，热烈欢迎布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫同尼赫鲁的联合声明。
    波兰“人民论坛报”的社论说，布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫同尼赫鲁的联合声明的意义远远超出了印苏两国的边界。为西方集团所憎恶的“日内瓦精神”从德里又获得了新的物质力量和鼓舞。“日内瓦精神”同“万隆精神”结合起来，这就大大缩小了“冷战”的地盘。
    匈牙利“人民之声报”的社论说，苏印两国联合声明“反映了苏联和印度两国政府在重要的国际问题上的共同观点”。“苏联和印度是和平共处的典范，它们共同反对准备战争、反对扩充军备并且反对殖民主义和种族歧视的政策。”
    罗马尼亚“火花报”的社论说，苏印两国在保卫和平的斗争中的友好合作关系，具有不可抹煞的重要意义。罗马尼亚人民衷心祝贺苏印友好合作的巩固，相信这是对普遍和平事业的巨大贡献。
    保加利亚“劳动报”在社论中强调指出了苏印两国领导人员所达成的协议对进一步巩固亚洲和世界和平的重大意义。
    德意志民主共和国“新德意志报”说，苏印两国的联合声明再度指出，国际关系的基础应当是共处的五项原则，必须继续尽一切努力来缓和国际紧张局势，并且促进和平和各国之间合作的事业。
