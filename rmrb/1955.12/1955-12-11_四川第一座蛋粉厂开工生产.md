    Sichuan's First Egg Powder Factory Starts Production
    Sichuan Province's newly built first egg powder factory, the Hechuan Dried Egg Factory, has officially started production in mid-November after more than a year of construction.
    The Hechuan Dried Egg Factory is located in Hechuan City, the distribution center for eggs in eastern and northern Sichuan. During the peak egg production season in late spring and early summer each year, approximately four to five million jin of fresh eggs flow into Hechuan City from various counties. After the factory starts production, it can process fresh eggs from twenty-four counties in the four special districts of Suining, Dazhou, Nanchong, and Jiangjin (some counties), which account for 43 percent of the province's total fresh egg production. This will greatly facilitate farmers' sales of fresh eggs, thereby encouraging the development of chicken farming as a sideline production in rural areas.
    The Hechuan Dried Egg Factory is a processing plant affiliated with the state-owned Food Company, producing and supplying egg powder for export. After going into production, it can produce four tons of whole egg powder per day. When the egg supply is sufficient, it requires 1.2 million jin of fresh eggs per month.
    Currently, it is the peak season for the production and marketing of fresh eggs. State-owned food companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in the twenty-four counties of Dazhou, Suining, and Tongliang, which are egg production areas in northern and eastern Sichuan, are actively purchasing fresh eggs in various villages. The Santai County Cooperative has signed 300 fresh egg purchasing contracts totaling 600 dan with local egg vendors and general merchandise merchants. The Suining and Nanchong special districts have also added purchasing points in various places to prepare a sufficient supply of goods for the egg factory.

    四川第一座蛋粉厂开工生产
    四川省新建的第一座蛋粉厂——合川干蛋厂，经过一年多的建设，已经在十一月中旬正式开工生产。
    合川干蛋厂建立在川东川北蛋的集散中心——合川市。在每年春末夏初的蛋产旺季，由各县流入合川市的鲜蛋约达四、五百万斤。这个厂在生产以后就可以为遂宁、达县、南充、江津（部分县）等四个专区的二十四个县，占全省鲜蛋产量的百分之四十三的鲜蛋进行加工。将大大便利农民出售鲜蛋，从而鼓励农村发展养鸡副业生产。
    合川干蛋厂是国营食品公司所属生产供应出口蛋粉的加工厂。投入生产后，每天能生产四吨全蛋粉。在蛋源供应充足时期，每月需要鲜蛋一百二十万斤。
    目前正是鲜蛋生产上市旺季，川北、川东蛋源产区的达县、遂宁、铜梁等二十四县的国营食品公司和供销合作社，正深入各乡村积极收购鲜蛋；三台县合作社已与当地蛋贩、杂货商签订了三百份共计六百担的鲜蛋代购合同。遂宁、南充两专区并在各地增设了收购点，为蛋厂准备充足的货源。
