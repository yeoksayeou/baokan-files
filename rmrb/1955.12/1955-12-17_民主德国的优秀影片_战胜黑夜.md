    German fascists were wiped out as early as ten years ago, and history has already made a severe conclusion about Hitler. In the eastern half of Germany, the sun shines on the land, and the people have truly become masters of their own destiny. While they are building a happy life with their own hands, they have not forgotten the darkness and terror of the twelve years of Hitler's rule in Germany; they have not forgotten those heroes who dedicated their precious lives to opposing the war of aggression and striving for peace in those dark years. The film "Conquering the Night" is a eulogy dedicated to those heroes who made brilliant contributions to the motherland and the people.

    "Conquering the Night" depicts the most reactionary and darkest era in German history. After Hitler seized power in 1933, the fascists, representing the interests of German monopoly capital, in order to consolidate their ruling position at home and attempt to realize their dream of seizing world hegemony, on the one hand, used the most terrifying and cruel means to suppress the resistance movement of their own people, arresting, imprisoning, and massacring Communists and anti-fascists in large numbers, turning Germany into a gloomy hell on earth; on the other hand, they ignited the flames of war in Europe, plunging hundreds of millions of people into the disasters of war. From the very first minute of Hitler's rise to power, the German Communist Party clearly pointed out to the people the truth that "Hitler is war." However, at that time, not all Germans understood this. Some were deceived by fascist propaganda and harbored illusions about Hitler; some only cared about their immediate personal interests and could not see the trap set by Hitler; some were frightened by the darkness and surrendered and betrayed, becoming shameful sinners. … The film reflects the complex situation of that era in a multifaceted and vivid way, writing about the awakening and changes of people under the lessons of real life, and enthusiastically praising the anti-fascist struggle of the outstanding representatives of the German working class—the German Communists.

    The protagonist of the film, Hans, is one of the countless unyielding anti-fascist fighters. This Communist Party member, who ran and galloped in the storm of the times, waged a relentless struggle against the enemy, and finally died heroically, is a hero image successfully created by the film. From the very beginning, the film shows Hans's character in a very complex and sharp political struggle. From the first day the swastika flag appeared on the building and the Nazi thugs began to rampage in the streets of Hamburg, Hans led the Hamburg-Bahrenfeld District Committee of the German Communist Party to launch a struggle against the fascists. Leaflets were scattered to factories like snowflakes, strikes were being launched, mass rallies were being held, and Hans was giving speeches. However, his call to the workers to "oppose Hitler with strikes" did not resonate among the working masses at that time, and people walked away indifferently. This was caused by the destructive policies implemented by the German Social Democratic Party. For many years, they had created divisions and disputes among the workers, paralyzing many people and losing confidence in their own strength. The betrayal of the Social Democratic Party led to the failure of the strike. Hans was not discouraged by the failure, but threw himself more heroically into the increasingly fierce struggle.

    The scene in the film where Hans exposes the conspiracy of the fascists to set fire to the Reichstag is very moving. The Reichstag fire was a vicious conspiracy created by the fascists themselves. The purpose of this conspiracy was to strangle the German Communist Party and stifle the voice of the German working class. This was a signal that Hitler launched a general attack on the German working class shortly after taking power. The fascists falsely accused the Communists of being the arsonists. At a mass meeting closely monitored by the Nazi police, Hans, disregarding the police officer's intimidation and the Nazi police's attack, bravely and incisively exposed the enemy's conspiracy in front of the masses. He said, "As long as the German Communist Party exists, ... their conspiracy will not be realized, and the struggle against Hitler will not stop!" Hans proved with his own actions that his words could stand the test of history, and the German Communist Party never relaxed its struggle against Hitler. Although Hans was imprisoned in a concentration camp for seven years, prison life did not frustrate his fighting spirit. After his release from prison, the secret police watched him every step of the way and threatened him, but he did not succumb, but became more calm and alert. The film truthfully depicts how Hans organized the scattered Communist Party members in a very dangerous environment, connected the link between Hamburg and Berlin, which was related to the fate of the struggle in the whole of Germany, and called on people to "not work for Hitler," "not sell their lives for Hitler," and "overthrow the war of aggression." Leaflets spread from factories to the streets, and from the rear to the front lines. His eyes were always on the future, seeing the essence of things through the surface of things. When Hitler occupied half of Europe and the Nazis were invincible, he saw Hitler's imminent demise; when his comrade Erich was troubled by the sound of "Heil Hitler" on the street, Hans thought about how to win over those who were temporarily marching with Hitler to build a new Germany together. Hans's unwavering confidence in victory and his optimistic fighting spirit, like a fire in the night, inspired people to move forward. When the Soviet Red Army was about to enter German territory, Hans was arrested and sentenced to death due to the betrayal of the traitor Egie. Hans did not give up the struggle in the last moment of his life. The voice of justice he made in the court made the enemy tremble, and he judged the judges.

    The film not only prominently depicts Hans's character in the above-mentioned sharp political struggle, but also enriches his character in the depiction of his family life; and also makes a successful portrayal of Hans's wife, the Communist Party member Gerda. The film skillfully combines the most intense political struggle with the warm family happiness; integrates Hans's strength and bravery in the struggle against the enemy with his meticulous care for his wife; and combines Gerda's clear and firm political understanding, her ability to withstand severe tests, and her gentle femininity towards her husband. Hans and his wife deeply loved each other, and they loved their son Peter even more. For the great cause—overthrowing Hitler and building Germany into a socialist country—they consciously participated in the struggle, risking being killed at any time. Hans's sacrifice, although painful for Gerda, she knew why, she could withstand the test, and she became stronger. The film expresses the deep love and great comradeship between Hans and Gerda in a very harmonious way. This not only makes Hans's image fuller and more amiable, but also leaves a deep impression on Gerda's image.

    The images created by Wilhelm Koch-Hooge, the actor who plays Hans, and Helga Göring, the actress who plays Gerda, are profound and moving. Wilhelm Koch-Hooge's skillful, simple, and intrinsically powerful performance makes Hans's image very vivid. Helga Göring successfully created an image representing a very conscious German modern woman.

    The film also makes good portrayals of the image of another Communist Party member, Erich, as well as people with various different ideas in the struggle against Hitler, such as the politically indifferent Rotte, the Hitler-supporting Mrs. Globig, and the traitor Egie.

    Erich is Hans's loyal comrade-in-arms. His wife, Rotte, is young and beautiful, and they love each other. However, Rotte does not understand the significance of Erich's struggle against Hitler, she is afraid, she complains, and she blames Erich's misfortune of losing his job because of opposing Hitler on that "unlucky" and "damned" politics. She completely opposes personal family happiness to political struggle. She hopes that Erich will give up the struggle and live a "peaceful" and "comfortable" life. Because Rotte has this naive and wrong illusion, she cannot withstand severe tests. After Erich is arrested and imprisoned in a concentration camp, she is in pain, afraid, and does not know what to do. She finally betrayed her love with Erich and lived with the traitor Egie. She wanted to escape that "damned politics" by doing this. But did she escape? The film answered with real life.

    Egie, who was originally a Communist Party member and was frightened by Hitler's reign of terror, left the party at the beginning of the struggle. He used the excuse of "accumulating some strength for myself, and I will do it when the struggle really means something" to cover up his despicable and cowardly personal purpose. At first, he seemed to be able to boast of "keeping himself clean" and could hide in the self-"comforting" outer shell of "I don't oppose them (referring to the fascists), but I can't be their secret agent," but when the secret police repeatedly threatened him and crushed his outer shell with prisons and torture, his despicable soul was completely exposed. In order to save his shameful life, he betrayed Hans, Erich, and others, and finally degenerated into a criminal. The film relentlessly whips the traitor's filthy soul, and expresses the shattering of the illusion pursued by Rotte. She gradually awakens and stands with the revolutionaries. Although Rotte has all kinds of confused and wrong ideas, she is not a bad person. When she heard from Egie that Hans, Erich, and others had been betrayed, she hated Egie's despicable behavior and immediately ran to notify Erich to escape. With full enthusiasm, the authors of the film made a vivid and powerful criticism of Rotte's mistaken idea of not caring about politics through the depiction of the characters' fate, and made a true expression of the huge changes in this ordinary and kind person.

    Mrs. Globig, depicted in the film, is a person who has been initially awakened after suffering painful lessons. At first, she opposed others hanging flags indiscriminately, whether they were Communist or Hitler's. She believed that not getting involved in politics was "the safest." However, when her husband, who had been unemployed for four years, found a job in a fascist munitions factory and could get two hundred and eighty marks a month, personal immediate interests turned her into a loyal supporter of Hitler. What was the result of her supporting Hitler? Her son died in a foreign land, and her house was bombed. Her so-called "happiness" was completely destroyed. She realized what Hitler meant from her own life experiences.

    "Conquering the Night" is an excellent film. It not only depicts the German Communist Party leading the German people's anti-fascist struggle, but also summarizes the awakening process of ordinary people under Hitler's rule. Its powerful voice against the war of aggression and striving for peace not only encourages the German people who are fighting for the unification of Germany, but also encourages Chinese audiences who love peace and oppose the war of aggression.

    民主德国的优秀影片“战胜黑夜”
    叶遥
    编剧：古尔特·斯德恩、让纳·斯德恩
    导演：兹拉达·杜多夫翻译：胡伯胤德意志民主共和国德发电影制片厂出品长春电影制片厂配音复制
    德国法西斯主义者早在十年前就被歼灭了，历史已经严峻地给希特勒作了结论。在德国的东半部，阳光普照着大地，人民已经真正成为掌握自己命运的主人。当他们用双手建设幸福生活的时候，他们没有忘记希特勒统治德国的十二年中的黑暗和恐怖；他们更没有忘记那些在黑暗年代里，为了反对侵略战争、争取和平而献出宝贵生命的英雄们。影片“战胜黑夜”，就是献给那些对祖国、对人民作出光辉贡献的英雄们的颂歌。
    “战胜黑夜”所描写的时代，是德国历史上最反动、最黑暗的时代。一九三三年，希特勒取得政权后，代表德国垄断资本利益的法西斯主义者为了巩固他们在国内的统治地位，妄图实现夺取世界霸权的梦想，一方面用最恐怖的残酷手段，镇压本国人民的反抗运动，大批地逮捕、监禁、屠杀共产党人和反法西斯人士，把德国变成一座阴森的人间地狱；一方面在欧洲燃起了战火，使亿万人民陷在战争的灾难里。德国共产党从希特勒上台的第一分钟起，就向人们明确指出“希特勒就是战争”的真理。但是，在当时，并不是所有的德国人都了解的。有的被法西斯的欺骗宣传所蒙蔽，对希特勒存有幻想；有的只关心眼前的个人利益，看不见希特勒设下的陷阱；有的在黑暗面前吓破了胆，投降叛变，成为可耻的罪人。……影片多方面地、生动地反映了那个时代的复杂情况，写出了人们在现实生活教训下的觉醒和变化，热情地赞颂了德国工人阶级的优秀代表——德国共产党人的反法西斯斗争。
    影片的主角汉斯，是无数坚贞不屈的反法西斯战士中的一个。这个在时代的风暴中奔走驰骋、向敌人作无情斗争、最后英勇牺牲了的共产党员，是影片成功塑造的英雄形象。影片一开始便在十分复杂、尖锐的政治斗争中，表现了汉斯的性格。从“卐”字旗第一天出现在楼房上、纳粹党徒开始在汉堡街头横冲直闯的时候起，汉斯就领导着德国共产党汉堡——巴伦贝科区委员会，对法西斯展开斗争。传单像雪片一样散发到工厂，发动罢工的工作在进行，工人群众在集会，汉斯在演说。但是，他号召工人“用罢工反对希特勒”的声音，在当时的工人群众中并没有得到回响，人们冷淡地走掉了。这是德国社会民主党实行破坏政策所造成的。多年来，他们在工人中制造分裂，制造纠纷，使许多人麻痹了，对自己的力量失去了信心。社会民主党的叛变行为使罢工遭到失败。汉斯在失败面前没有灰心，他更英勇地投进日益激烈的斗争中。
    影片描写汉斯揭露法西斯分子纵火烧毁国会大厦的阴谋的场面，是非常动人的。德国国会大厦失火事件，是法西斯分子一手制造的毒辣阴谋，这个阴谋的目的是想要扼杀德国共产党，想要窒息德国工人阶级的声音。这是希特勒上台不久向德国工人阶级发动总攻击的信号。法西斯分子诬指共产党人为放火者。汉斯在纳粹警察严密监视的群众大会上，不顾警官的恫吓，不顾纳粹警察的袭击，勇敢地一针见血地在群众面前揭穿了敌人的阴谋。他说，“只要德国有共产党存在，……他们的阴谋就实现不了，反希特勒的斗争就不会停止！”汉斯用自己的行动证明他说的话是经得起历史考验的，德国共产党一刻也没有放松过反对希特勒的斗争。汉斯虽然在集中营里被监禁了七年，但牢狱生活并没有挫折他的斗志。出狱后，秘密警察一步不离地监视他，威胁他，但是他并没有屈服，而是变得更沉着、更机警了。影片真实地描写了汉斯在十分险恶的环境里，怎样把分散活动的共产党员们组织起来，把关系着全德国斗争命运的汉堡和柏林之间的联系连结起来，号召人们“不给希特勒做工”、“不给希特勒卖命”、“打倒侵略战争”的传单从工厂散到街头，从后方传到前线。他的眼睛总是望着未来，透过事物的表面，看到事物的本质。当希特勒占领了半个欧洲，纳粹分子不可一世的时候，他看见的是希特勒的濒临覆灭；当他的同志艾里赫为街上欢呼“希特勒万岁”的声音而烦恼的时候，汉斯想到的却是怎样争取那些暂时跟着希特勒游行的人，一同来建设新的德国。汉斯对胜利的坚定不移的信心，充满乐观的斗争精神，像黑夜的火光一样，鼓舞着人们前进。苏联红军将要打进德国境内的时候，由于叛徒艾吉的出卖，汉斯被捕并被判处死刑。汉斯在他的生命的最后一刻，也没有放弃斗争。他在法庭上所发出的正义的声音使敌人发抖，他对审判者作了审判。
    影片不但在上述尖锐的政治斗争中突出地描写了汉斯的性格，而且也在他的家庭生活的描写中丰富了他的性格；并且对汉斯的妻子、共产党员盖尔达的形象也作了成功的刻划。影片巧妙地把最紧张的政治斗争和充满温暖的家庭幸福结合在一起；把汉斯在对敌斗争中的坚强英勇和对妻子无微不至的体贴溶合在一起；把盖尔达在政治上认识明确、坚定，经得起严重考验的刚强的品质和她对丈夫的女性温柔结合在一起。汉斯和他的妻子彼此深切相爱，他们更爱他们的儿子彼得。为了伟大的事业——打倒希特勒，把德国建设成社会主义国家，他们冒着随时有可能被杀的危险，自觉地参加斗争。汉斯的牺牲，虽然使盖尔达很痛苦，但她知道这是为了什么，她经得住考验，并且变得更坚强了。影片对汉斯和盖尔达的深厚爱情和伟大的同志爱，表现得非常协调。这不仅使汉斯的形象更丰满，更亲切，而且盖尔达的形象也给人留下了深刻的印象。
    扮演汉斯的演员维廉·考赫—浩格和扮演盖尔达的演员海尔格·戈林所创造的形象是深刻动人的。维廉·考赫—浩格的纯熟、朴素、含有内在力量的表演，使汉斯的形象很鲜明。海尔格·戈林成功地创造了一个代表很有觉悟的德国现代妇女的形象。
    影片对另一个共产党员艾里赫的形象，以及对在反对希特勒斗争中有着各种不同想法的人，例如不关心政治的罗特捷、拥护希特勒的格洛比格太太、叛徒艾吉等人物，都作了很好的描写。
    艾里赫是汉斯的忠实的战友。他的妻子罗特捷年轻漂亮，他们彼此相爱。但是，罗特捷不了解艾里赫对希特勒进行斗争的意义，她害怕、埋怨，她把艾里赫因反对希特勒而失业的不幸，归咎于那“倒霉的”“该死的”政治。她把个人的家庭幸福完全和政治斗争对立起来。她希望艾里赫放弃斗争，过“平静”、“安适”的生活。由于罗特捷有这种稚气、错误的幻想，她经受不起严重的考验，艾里赫被捕进集中营后，她痛苦，害怕，不知道该怎么办。她终于背叛了她和艾里赫的爱情，同叛徒艾吉生活在一起了。她想以此来逃避掉那“该死的政治”。但是逃掉了没有呢？影片用真实的生活作了回答。
    原先是共产党员、在希特勒恐怖统治面前吓破了胆的艾吉，在斗争刚开始的时候便脱离了党，他用“给自己积蓄一些力量，等到斗争真有些意义的时候我再干”为借口，掩盖他卑鄙的贪生怕死的个人目的。他最初好像还可以夸口“洁身自好”，还可以躲在“我不反对他们（指法西斯），可是我也不能给他们当特务”的自制外壳里自我“安慰”，但是，当秘密警察三番五次威逼他，用监狱、拷打粉碎了他的外壳的时候，他的卑鄙的灵魂便暴露无余了。他为了保住自己可耻的生命，出卖了汉斯、艾里赫等人，终于堕落成犯罪的人。影片无情地鞭笞了这个叛徒的龌龊灵魂，并表现了罗特捷所追求的幻想的破灭，她逐渐觉醒，同革命者站在一起。罗特捷虽然有种种糊涂错误的想法，她却不是一个坏人。当她从艾吉嘴里听到汉斯、艾里赫等人被出卖的时候，她痛恨艾吉的卑鄙行为，马上跑去通知艾里赫逃走。影片作者怀着满腔热情，通过对人物命运的描写，对罗特捷不关心政治的错误思想作了生动有力的批判，并对这个普通的善良的人的巨大变化作了真实的表现。
    影片描写的格洛比格太太，是一个遭受惨痛教训后而初步有所醒悟的人。她最初反对别人乱挂旗子，不管是共产党的或是希特勒的。她认为不过问政治“才最安全”。但是，当她的已经失业四年的丈夫在法西斯一个军火工厂找到工作、每月可以拿二百八十个马克薪金的时候，个人的眼前利益把她变成希特勒的忠实拥护者。她拥护希特勒的结果是什么呢？是儿子战死在国外，住宅被炸毁。她的所谓“幸福”完全被毁灭了。她从自己的生活遭遇中体会到了希特勒意味着什么。
    “战胜黑夜”是一部优秀的影片，它不仅描写了德国共产党领导德国人民的反法西斯斗争，而且概括地表现了希特勒统治下普通人民的觉醒过程。它的反对侵略战争、争取和平的强大声音，不仅鼓舞着正在为争取德国统一而斗争的德国人民，而且也鼓舞着爱好和平、反对侵略战争的中国观众。
