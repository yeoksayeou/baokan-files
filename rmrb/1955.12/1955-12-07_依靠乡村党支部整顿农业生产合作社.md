Relying on Rural Party Branches to Rectify Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Fan Zichen

The Communist Party Committees of various counties in the Songjiang region of Jiangsu Province have conscientiously relied on the township branches to strengthen their leadership over agricultural production cooperatives, enabling the work of rectifying and consolidating new and old cooperatives to proceed smoothly and achieve initial results.

The development of the agricultural cooperation movement in the Songjiang region is generally healthy. The plan for establishing cooperatives this winter and next spring has already been overfulfilled before autumn. The number of peasant households joining cooperatives in the entire region has increased from 12 percent to 59 percent of the total number of peasant households, achieving cooperatives in every township. Some leading cadres of township branches have therefore developed two undesirable ideological sentiments: one is blind optimism, believing that "the cooperatives have been established, and the task is complete." In some townships with more old cooperatives and a better foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, the complacency of the branch's leading cadres is even more serious. They say, "In the past, spontaneous cooperatives also developed, so now with experience, what are we afraid of?" Some branches have the idea that "the more and bigger the cooperatives, the more glorious," and therefore blindly develop without consolidation. The other is worry and fear of difficulties, believing that "development is easy, consolidation is difficult." Especially in townships with few or no old cooperatives, dozens of new cooperatives have been developed at once, and some branches feel overwhelmed. They say, "I have only one gut but two ends to hang on to; if I grasp this, I lose that." The leadership methods of many branches have not been improved accordingly. In the past, when there were few cooperatives, branch committee members could divide up the work and take responsibility for it; now that there are more cooperatives, as well as mutual aid teams and individual farmers, they all need to be led, and they can't take responsibility for everything. The branches of Shuangmiao and other townships in Jinshan County still lead the old cooperatives, new cooperatives, and mutual aid teams without distinction, resulting in grasping the old cooperatives and losing the new ones, or grasping the new cooperatives and losing the mutual aid teams. Many newly established cooperatives have not been rectified and consolidated in a timely manner, and their quality is not high. In many areas, the planning was not thorough when developing cooperatives. Most of the rural cadres and Party and Youth League backbone members were concentrated in the cooperatives, and no proper adjustments were made after the establishment of the cooperatives. As a result, some mutual aid teams have disintegrated due to the lack of backbone members, or they have found their own mutual aid partners.

In response to the above problems, when deploying the work of rectifying and consolidating new and old cooperatives, the Communist Party Committees of various counties in the Songjiang region first convened meetings of branch secretaries at the county or district level to strengthen education and unify the guiding ideology of the branches. The township branch secretary meetings held by each county and district, on the one hand, through summarizing, affirmed the achievements of the cooperation movement, so that everyone established confidence; on the other hand, they raised the problems, so that everyone realized that it was necessary to spend some time rectifying and consolidating the cooperatives. Some branches in Nanhui County originally did not face up to the problems existing in the cooperatives and wanted to achieve full cooperation all at once. After education, everyone saw that the county had overfulfilled the plan for establishing cooperatives this winter and next spring, and the number of peasant households joining cooperatives had reached 55.8 percent of the total number of peasant households, basically meeting the masses' requirements for joining cooperatives; they also saw that there were still many problems in each cooperative. Preliminary statistics for the whole county showed that there were 306 cooperatives whose production order had not been established or had been established but remained a formality, accounting for 22 percent of the newly established cooperatives. In this way, everyone clearly realized that it was necessary to work hard to consolidate the cooperatives, and they reflected, "The instructions from the higher authorities are just right!" After the meeting, everyone made every effort to consolidate the cooperatives. On the other hand, for branches with fear of difficulties and lack of methods, the counties, in the meetings, built confidence by analyzing favorable conditions and passing on methods of running cooperatives.

Although the guiding ideology was unified at the meeting, some branches developed a retreating mood when they encountered specific difficulties in actual work. According to this situation, the Jinshan County Committee instructed the township branches to advance in the face of difficulties, not to retreat in the face of difficulties, and to seize one or two cooperatives with the most problems, compare them with the experience of advanced cooperatives, and earnestly study and find solutions to the problems. This would not only improve leadership skills, but also set a living example for everyone. Six of the twelve township branch secretaries in the Zhujing District originally did not know how to rectify and consolidate cooperatives. After delving into the work according to the instructions of the county committee, they learned methods and promptly guided the consolidation of cooperatives in the entire township. The Shanghai County Committee stipulated that county and district cadres should personally lead the township branches in studying the work of leading cooperatives. The county committee this time drew a total of 42 cadres (including 12 section-level cadres) from county-level organs to work in the countryside, and stipulated that each person should help the branch learn the methods of leading the rectification and consolidation of cooperatives. After doing this, more than 50 percent of the township branch secretaries and branch committee members in the county became experts. Others, such as the Jiading County Committee and the district committee, also frequently praised the branches that had achieved success in the work of rectifying and consolidating cooperatives at meetings or through circulars, and introduced the experiences of these branches, which played a great role in promoting township branches and general cadres to delve into the work of cooperatives.

To enable the township branches to run more than a dozen or dozens of cooperatives in the township well, it is necessary to help the branches improve their leadership methods accordingly. The county committees of various counties have also done a lot of work in this regard, the main one being the universal establishment and restoration of mutual aid and cooperation networks. The process of establishing and restoring mutual aid and cooperation networks in each township is generally to first rectify or establish the township's mutual aid and cooperation committee, with the branch secretary or deputy secretary as the director, and to absorb experienced and capable new and old cooperative directors and mutual aid team leaders as members. Under the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation committee, they then study and establish the mutual aid and cooperation network. There are basically two types of establishment methods and organizational forms: one is to re-divide areas and set up points based on the original mutual aid and cooperation network according to the new situation. The other is to re-establish the joint cooperative committee under the township's mutual aid and cooperation network. However, whether it is dividing areas and setting up points or establishing a joint cooperative committee, it is necessary to select a better old cooperative or new cooperative to be responsible for driving the surrounding newly established cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers. Each area or each joint cooperative committee is under the charge of a branch committee member or township cadre, who specifically grasps the central cooperative or cooperatives with more problems, creates experience, and guides the work in a timely manner. The township branches in Songjiang County also adopted the method of "grasping both ends and bringing along the middle," ranking various types of cooperatives, promptly summarizing the experience of advanced cooperatives to drive the general cooperatives, and then focusing on helping the cooperatives with more problems to solve problems, which also yielded good results.

The township branches regularly convene mutual aid and cooperation committee meetings or mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings to check work, exchange experiences, and solve outstanding problems in the cooperatives in a planned and phased manner. After the establishment of cooperatives in Dongjing Township, Songjiang County, this autumn, it successively held five township mutual aid and cooperation committee meetings, introducing the experience of typical cooperatives directly led by the township branch, such as "how to establish a financial accounting system" and "how to handle various specific policy issues within the cooperative," and then promoted them through the "network," effectively driving the new cooperatives to solve many problems in a timely manner. Through the mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting, Chengbei Township in Nanhui County exchanged experience in rectifying cooperatives, which not only enabled the newly established cooperatives to universally implement the small-section contract system, establish production order, and handle outstanding issues, but also fairly priced eight cattle and three large boats in the whole township that had not yet been dealt with, adjusted improperly handled issues, and corrected the selfish tendencies of 61 cooperative members in keeping private plots of land.

The township branches also lead the new and old cooperatives to establish contact stations, making full use of the old cooperatives to lead the new cooperatives or the advanced cooperatives to lead the cooperatives with more problems to carry out work. Tingdong Township in Songjiang County established contact stations in each area, with accounting mutual aid, production technology, and other groups under them, specializing in exchanging accounting business, management, and production technology experience. The main methods of activity are three: one is to regularly convene station committees to exchange experience; one is for old cooperative cadres to often go to new cooperatives to pass on experience and help new cooperatives solve problems; and the other is for new cooperative cadres to promptly consult old cooperatives when they encounter difficult problems. These three methods have enabled the old cooperatives to help the new cooperatives solve many problems in a timely manner.

Leading cooperatives to carry out competitions, organizing visits, and conducting on-site education are also regular tasks of the township branches. Dongjing Township in Songjiang County organized short-distance individual or dual work competitions between and within cooperatives (comparing farming techniques, comparing the maintenance of draught cattle, comparing the improvement of management, etc.), with good results. Through organizing visits and evaluations, Gonghe Village in Tingdong Township vigorously promoted the reform of production technology and launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign. Currently, the three cooperatives have accumulated more than 20,000 dan of aquatic grass and river mud fertilizer.

Because the counties in the Songjiang region have unified the guiding ideology of the township branches and initially improved the leadership methods of the branches, the work of rectifying and consolidating cooperatives has achieved initial results. However, this is only the beginning, and there are still many problems, such as the fact that some branches have not yet improved their leadership methods, and some mutual aid and cooperation networks have become a mere formality. These problems still need to be further led and helped by the county committees of various counties to be solved, so as to better lead the cooperative movement forward.

    依靠乡村党支部整顿农业生产合作社
    范子晨
    江苏省松江地区各县的中共县委认真依靠乡支部，加强了对农业生产合作社的领导，使整顿和巩固新老社的工作顺利展开，并取得了初步成效。
    松江地区农业合作化运动的发展基本上是健康的。今年冬天明年春天的建社计划，已经在秋前超额完成。全区入社农户已经由占总农户的百分之十二增加到百分之五十九，做到了乡乡有社。部分乡支部的领导干部因此产生了两种不好的思想情绪：一种是盲目乐观，认为“社已经建好，大功告成”。在一些老社较多、互助合作基础较好的乡里，支部领导干部的自满情绪更加严重，他们说：“过去自发社也发起来了，现在有了经验还怕什么？”有的支部有“办社越多越大越光荣”的想法，因此盲目发展，不加巩固。另一种是担忧畏难，认为“发展容易，巩固难”。特别是老社很少或没有老社的乡，这次一下发展了几十个社，有的支部就感到束手无策。他们说：“一根肠子两头挂，抓了这个，丢了那个。”许多支部的领导方法也没有相应的改善，过去社少，支部委员还可以分兵把口，包下来；现在社多了，还有互助组、个体农民，都要领导，包不下来。金山县双庙等乡支部对老社、新社和互助组的领导，仍旧是头发胡子一把抓，结果抓了老社丢了新社，抓了新社丢了互助组，许多新建社没有及时整顿和巩固，质量不高。许多地区发展合作社的时候规划不周，乡村干部、党团员骨干大部分集中到社里，建社以后又没有妥善调整，结果有些互助组因为缺少骨干已涣散解体，或者自找对象互助。
    针对上述问题，松江地区各县的中共县委在部署整顿和巩固新老社工作的时候，首先以县或区为单位召开了支部书记会议，加强教育，统一支部的指导思想。各县、区召开的乡支部书记会议，一方面通过总结，肯定合作化运动的成绩，使大家树立信心；再摆开问题，使大家认识到必须用一个时间来整顿和巩固合作社。南汇县有些支部原来没有正视社里存在的问题，想一下子全面合作化。经过教育，大家看到全县已超额完成了今年冬天明年春天的建社计划，入社农户已达到总农户的百分之五十五点八，基本上满足了群众的入社要求；也看到了各社的问题还很多，全县初步统计，生产秩序没有建立或虽然已经建立，但是流于形式的就有三百零六个社，占新建社的百分之二十二。这样，大家明确认识到必须努力做好巩固社的工作，纷纷反映：“上级指示正中火候！”会后，大家全力进行巩固社的工作。另一方面，对有畏难情绪和缺少办法的支部，各县在会议中，通过分析有利条件，传授办社办法，使大家树立信心。
    指导思想虽然在会议上都统一了，但是在实际工作中一碰到具体困难，有的支部又产生了退缩情绪。根据这一情况，金山县委就指示乡支部要知难而进，不要知难而退，应当抓住一两个问题最多的社，对照先进社的经验，认真研究，找出解决问题的办法。这样做既能够提高领导水平，又给大家做出活的榜样。朱径区十二个乡支部书记，原来有六个是不懂得如何整顿和巩固社的，这次他们按照县委的指示钻下去以后，学得了办法，及时指导了全乡巩固社的工作。上海县委规定县区干部要亲自带领乡支部研究领导社的工作。县委这次在县级机关共抽了四十二个干部（内十二个科长级干部）下乡工作，并规定每人都要帮助支部学会领导整顿和巩固社的办法，这样做了以后就使全县百分之五十以上的乡支部书记和支部委员变成内行。其他如嘉定县委和区委还经常在会议上或利用通报表扬在整顿和巩固社的工作中获得成绩的支部，介绍这些支部的经验，这对推动乡支部和一般干部深入合作社工作起了很大作用。
    要使乡支部把全乡十几个或几十个合作社办好，必须帮助支部相应地改进领导方法。各县县委在这一方面也做了不少工作，其中主要的是普遍建立和恢复互助合作网。各乡建立和恢复互助合作网的过程，一般是首先整顿或成立乡的互助合作委员会，由支部书记或副书记任主任，吸收有经验有能力的新老社社长和互助组组长为委员，在互助合作委员会领导下，再研究建立互助合作网。建立的办法和组织形式基本有两种：一种是在原有互助合作网的基础上，根据新的情况，重新划片设点。另一种是在乡的互助合作网下重新建立联社委员会。但是无论是划片设点或者是成立联社委员会，都要选择一个较好的老社或新社，负责带动周围新建社、互助组和个体农民。每片或每个联社委员会都由支部委员或乡干部分工掌握，并具体掌握中心社或问题较多的社，创造经验及时指导工作。松江县各乡支部还采用“抓两头带中间”的办法，将各种类型社进行排队，及时总结先进社的经验带动一般社，再重点帮助问题多的社解决问题，收效也很好。
    乡支部定期召开互助合作委员会或互助合作代表会，通过会议来检查工作，交流经验，有计划地按段解决社里的突出问题。松江县洞经乡今年秋天建社以后，曾先后开了五次乡的互助合作委员会，介绍了乡支部直接领导的典型社的经验：如“怎样建立财务账册制度”“怎样处理社内各项具体政策问题”等等，然后通过“网”推广下去，及时有效地带动新社解决了很多问题。南汇县城北乡通过互助合作代表会，交流整社经验，不仅使新建社普遍推行了小段包工制，建立了生产秩序，处理了遗留问题，全乡有八头还没有处理的耕牛和三只还没有处理的大船都订了公平的租价，对处理不当的问题作了调整，并纠正了六十一户社员留自留田中自私自利的偏向。
    乡支部还领导新老社建立联系站，充分运用老社带新社或先进社带问题较多的社进行工作。松江县亭东乡在每个片里建立了联系站，下设会计互助、生产技术等小组，专门相互交流会计业务、经营管理和生产技术等经验，其活动方法，主要有三种：一种是定期召开站委员会，交流经验；一种是老社干部经常到新社传授经验，帮助新社解决问题；再一种是新社社干部遇到困难问题，及时向老社请教。这三种办法都使老社及时帮助新社解决了很多问题。
    领导合作社开展竞赛，组织观摩，实地进行教育，也是乡支部的一项经常工作。松江县洞经乡组织社和社间短距离的单项工作或双项工作评比竞赛（比耕作技术，比保养耕牛，比改进经营管理等等），效果很好。亭东乡共和村通过组织参观评比，有力地推动了生产技术的改革，开展了积肥运动，现在三个社已经积水草河泥肥两万多担。
    松江地区各县由于统一了乡支部的指导思想，初步改进了支部的领导方法，因此当前整顿和巩固合作社的工作已取得了初步成绩。但是，这还仅仅是开始，问题还有不少，如有些支部的领导方法还没有改进，有的互助合作网流于形式等等，这些问题还有待各县县委继续领导和帮助乡支部加以解决，以便更好地领导合作化运动前进。
