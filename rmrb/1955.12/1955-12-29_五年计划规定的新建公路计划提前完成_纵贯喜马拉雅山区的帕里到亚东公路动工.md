Xinhua News Agency, December 28th. China's first Five-Year Plan's new highway construction plan has been completed ahead of schedule. The transportation departments plan to build several thousand more kilometers of new highways in the next two years, and are preparing to submit them to the State Council for review.

According to the original Five-Year Plan, the central government would invest in the construction of more than 10,100 kilometers of highways within five years. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the transportation departments will have exceeded the original Five-Year Plan target by 6.5 percent in terms of highway mileage, completing more than 10,800 kilometers of new highways. Most of the completed highways are located in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities where transportation is relatively isolated. More important ones include the Kangzang Highway, the Qingzang Highway, and the main highway on Hainan Island; as well as the highways from Kunming to Menghai, from Yangbajing on the Qingzang Highway to Xigaze and Gyangze, from Chengdu to Aba, and from Xining to Yushu. These highways closely connect the political, economic, and cultural centers and commodity distribution centers of ethnic minorities with cities, which plays a significant role in developing the economic and cultural lives of ethnic minorities. After the opening of the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway, the political and economic life of ethnic minorities in Sichuan, Qinghai, and Tibet has been further connected with the big family of the motherland. In the past, the wool and fur of the herders in those areas were often stockpiled and could not be transported out, and the industrial products they needed were also very difficult to obtain. After the opening of these two highways, the export of livestock products and the import of industrial products and basic construction materials in Qinghai and Tibet have become much more convenient.

In recent years, in addition to the new highways built with central government investment, various provinces have also built and restored more than 13,000 kilometers of highways with local investment and the mobilization of labor. In Guizhou Province, which has always had inconvenient transportation, 70 percent of the counties and districts are now connected to Guiyang City by highways. In Shanxi Province, 77 counties are now accessible by automobiles and trains, and the remaining 18 counties are accessible by trucks.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 28th. Construction of the Pari to Yadong Highway, which traverses the Himalayas, partially began on the 23rd. This highway is more than 40 kilometers long and is the third highway built in Tibet by the State Council using the "work-for-relief" method. Currently, the sound of explosives breaking rocks can already be heard in the narrow valleys of the construction section. More than 1,000 Tibetan laborers from Gyangze, Bailang, and other places along the Nyang Chu River will also set off for the construction site.

Yadong is a necessary stop on the ancient trade route in southern Tibet and is one of the trade markets designated by the Chinese government in the Agreement on Trade and Traffic between the Tibet Region of China and India, signed in Beijing on April 29, 1954. There are large areas of virgin forest here, rich in famous architectural timber such as the famous Himalayan pine and tall spruce. After the completion of the Pari to Yadong Highway, it will connect southern Tibet with the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways, which will provide favorable conditions for the development of resources in southern Tibet and the development of trade between China and India.

### 五年计划规定的新建公路计划提前完成  纵贯喜马拉雅山区的帕里到亚东公路动工

    五年计划规定的新建公路计划提前完成
    纵贯喜马拉雅山区的帕里到亚东公路动工
    新华社二十八日讯　我国第一个五年计划规定新建公路的计划已经提前完成。交通部门计划在今后的两年内，再修建几千公里的新公路，并且正在准备报请国务院审查。
    按原定五年计划规定，五年内由中央投资修建的公路是一万零一百多公里。预计到今年年底，按公路里程计算，交通部门将超额百分之六点五完成原定五年计划的任务，修好一万零八百多公里新公路。已经修好的公路，大多在交通比较闭塞的少数民族聚居地区。比较重要的有康藏公路、青藏公路、海南岛主干公路；还有从昆明通往勐海，从青藏公路上的羊八井通往日喀则、江孜，从成都通往阿坝和从西宁通往玉树的公路等。这些公路都把少数民族的政治、经济、文化中心和货物集散地以及城市紧密联系起来，对于发展少数民族的经济、文化生活有很大作用。康藏公路和青藏公路通车以后，基本上把四川、青海、西藏一带少数民族的政治经济生活和祖国大家庭进一步联系起来了。那些地区牧民们的羊毛、毛皮过去常常积压着运不出来，他们所需要的工业品也很不容易得到。这两条公路通车以后，青海、西藏一带畜牧产品输出和工业品、基本建设器材的输入都方便得多。
    近几年来，除了中央投资修建的新公路以外，各省还由地方投资和动员民工力量修建和恢复了一万三千多公里公路。一向交通不便的贵州省，已经有百分之七十的县和区有公路和贵阳市相通。山西省已经有七十七县通了汽车和火车，其余十八县都通了大车。
    新华社拉萨二十八日电　纵贯喜马拉雅山区的帕里到亚东公路已经在二十三日部分动工修筑。这条公路全长四十多公里，是国务院采用以工代赈的方式在西藏修筑的第三条公路。现在，在施工段的狭谷里，已经响着炸破山石的炮声。年楚河沿岸江孜、白朗等地的一千多名藏族民工也将动身前往这个工地。
    亚东是西藏南部古商道必经之地，是一九五四年四月二十九日在北京签订的中华人民共和国、印度共和国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中，由中国政府指定的贸易市场之一。这里有大片的原始森林区，盛产著名的喜马拉雅松和高大的云杉等名贵建筑木材。帕里到亚东的公路建成以后，便把西藏南部和康藏、青藏公路衔接起来，对开发西藏南部的资源，和发展中、印两国之间的贸易将提供有利的条件。
