Heilongjiang Province's timber companies have manufactured many house frames for farmers. These house frames are made according to the style of houses in northeastern rural areas. Each main piece of lumber is numbered, and a complete house frame can be assembled by putting the lumber together in numerical order. After farmers buy these house frames, they only need to erect them, plaster them with mud, and cover them with thatch to make them habitable. They say that using these house frames saves money and effort and can solve housing problems in a timely manner. Farmers in the third district of Wangkui County did a detailed calculation and said, "Buying a house frame from the timber company saves seventy or eighty yuan compared to hiring a carpenter to make one." Another farmer said, "Using this kind of house frame to build houses changes the centuries-old habit of using young trees to build houses in the countryside, and avoids the phenomenon of everyone going up the mountain to cut down trees and damage young forests." Therefore, this kind of house frame is welcomed by farmers. Now, farmers in various places are actively going through the procedures for advance purchases with timber companies. According to statistics from timber companies in Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Suihua and other six cities and counties, contracts have been signed with farmers for more than 2,200 house frames, and it is planned to complete the task this winter and next spring.

    黑龙江农民用现成房架造房
    黑龙江省各县木材公司为农民制造了很多房架子。这种房架子是根据东北农村的房子形式制成的。每件主要木料都编上号码，把木料按着号码的顺序搭起来就是一套完整的房架。农民买到这种房架以后，只要把它竖起来，抹上泥，盖上草，就可以住人。他们说用这种房架省钱、省事，又能及时解决住房问题。望奎县三区农民算了细账后说：“买木材公司的一座房架比自己请木匠作要省七、八十元”。另一位农民说：“用这种房架造房子，改变了农村几百年来盖房用幼林的习惯，避免了大家上山乱砍乱伐损害幼林的现象”。因此这种房架受到农民的欢迎。现在各地农民正积极同木材公司办理预购手续。据佳木斯、牡丹江、绥化等六个市县木材公司的统计，已和农民签订了两千二百多间房架子的合同，计划今冬明春完成任务。
