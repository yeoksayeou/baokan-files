Xinhua News Agency, December 20th—The People's Construction Bank of China, while ensuring the timely supply of funds for capital construction this year, has strengthened its inspection and supervision of the use of these funds, saving the country a significant amount of construction funds.

    The total value of basic construction budgets reviewed by the People's Construction Bank system this year increased more than sixfold compared to last year. After discovering that many basic construction budgets were too high, they had, by the end of November, reduced inflated portions by more than 238 million yuan. Some branches and sub-branches also suggested that construction units reduce unnecessary extravagant decoration expenses by more than 9 million yuan.
    The People's Construction Bank also took various measures this year to urge and help construction units mobilize internal resources for construction. By the end of November, they had reviewed the financial revenue and expenditure plans of 2,316 units, and after review, added internal resources that could be mobilized, valued at more than 200.9 million yuan, an increase of 18.68 percent compared to the original plan. After the internal resource mobilization targets were set, the Construction Bank also checked the implementation of each unit, and urged each unit to dispose of stockpiled equipment and materials, clear creditor and debtor relationships, and put materials that could be used for this year's projects into construction as soon as possible. By the end of November, they had urged these more than 2,000 units to utilize internal resources worth more than 1.17 billion yuan for this year's construction.
    People's Construction Bank branches and sub-branches across the country have gradually strengthened supervision of basic construction project payment settlements this year, strictly following the principle of allocating funds according to the amount of work completed, preventing various losses and waste caused by state allocations not being paid according to the actual progress of the project. By the end of November, the total value of project progress settlements accounted for more than 96 percent of the total value that should have been settled.
    In addition, they also strengthened supervision of the use of circulating funds for basic construction this year. They first verified advance payments for the purchase of building materials, reducing the proportion of advance payments to the total value of annual contracted projects from 23.63 percent in 1954 to 19.36 percent. This avoided the premature centralized payment of financial funds and effectively prevented the accumulation of materials. In order to supervise the special use of funds and ensure financial revenue, construction bank organizations at all levels also urged construction units and construction and installation enterprises to turn over a total of more than 230 million yuan in profits, basic depreciation funds, and other payments.
    Since the central government issued instructions to vigorously practice comprehensive economy, the Construction Bank has urged and helped basic construction units and construction and installation enterprises to reduce unnecessary construction projects and equipment purchases, and has inspected units that do not reduce construction costs in accordance with regulations.

    建设银行加强财政监督节约大量建设资金
    据新华社二十日讯　中国人民建设银行今年在保证基本建设资金及时供应的前提下，加强了对基本建设资金使用情况的检查和监督，为国家节约了大量建设资金。
    中国人民建设银行系统今年审查的基本建设预算（以总值计）比去年增加了六倍多。他们在发现了许多基本建设预算偏高以后，到十一月底，已经从高估的部分中核减了二亿三千八百多万元。部分分行和支行还建议建设单位削减了不必要的豪华装饰费九百多万元。
    中国人民建设银行今年还采取各种措施，督促和帮助建设单位动员内部资源投入建设。到十一月底止，他们共审查了二千三百十六个单位的财务收支计划，审查以后增列了可以动员的内部资源价值二亿零九百多万元，比原计划增加了百分之十八点六八。在动员内部资源的指标确定以后，建设银行又检查了各单位的执行情况，并且督促各单位处理积压器材，清理债权债务，把可以用于本年工程的器材尽早地投入工程建设。到十一月底，他们已经督促这二千多个单位利用了价值十一亿七千多万元的内部资源投入今年的建设。
    中国人民建设银行各地分行和支行今年逐步加强了对各基本建设工程价款结算的监督，严格按照完成多少工程拨付多少款的原则，防止了国家拨款不按照工程实际进度支付所造成的各种损失和浪费。到十一月底，工程进度结算总值已占应结算总值的百分之九十六以上。
    此外，他们今年还对基本建设流动资金的运用情况加强了监督。他们首先核实了购置建筑材料的预付款，使预付款额占年度包工合同总值的比例由一九五四年的百分之二十三点六三降低到占百分之十九点三六。这就避免了财政资金的过早集中支付，并且有效地防止了材料积压。为了监督资金的专款专用，保证财政收入，建设银行各级组织还督促建设单位和建筑安装企业上缴了利润、基本折旧金和其他款项共二亿三千多万元。
    自从中央发出厉行全面节约的指示以后，建设银行又督促和帮助基本建设单位和建筑安装企业削减不必要的建设项目和设备购置，对不按规定降低建筑造价的单位进行了检查。
