    For the Convenience of Farmers
    After the figures for grain "fixed production," "fixed purchase," and "fixed sales" have been determined down to the household level, it is necessary to rationally adjust grain purchasing and supply points based on the actual needs of grain purchase and sales in rural areas. This not only strengthens the planned nature of grain work and saves a large amount of transportation costs, but also greatly facilitates farmers.
    When the new grain began to be stored this year, the grain department of Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, planned to add a batch of grain collection points to make it easier for farmers to deliver grain. Recently, in order to facilitate farmers in selling and buying grain, the grain department of this county has also established a batch of "stay-in-village grain depots." These grain depots are located in villages far from supply points but have warehouses or empty houses. Their task is to store and supply grain locally. Currently, the "stay-in-village grain depots" in six districts of this county have started collecting grain.
    This method has been embraced by the vast number of farmers. In the past, farmers in Fushou Township and Shangshan Township in the Anding District of this county had to send grain to grain depots thirty miles away; farmers who lacked grain also had to travel fifteen or twenty miles to buy grain. Whether buying or selling grain, they had to cross mountains, which was very inconvenient. Now, according to the grain "fixed purchase" and "fixed sales" figures for these two townships, the government has established a grain depot in Fushou Township. In this way, many farmers can deliver or buy grain just by stepping out of their homes, and the farthest only have to walk six miles. When repairing warehouses, nearby farmers automatically took out planks and fir wood to help the government repair the warehouses. Farmer Zheng Yanxun said: "The People's Government is thinking of us in every way. We must establish grain protection groups and protect our own grain well!"

    为了农民的方便
    在粮食“定产”“定购”“定销”数字确定到户以后，根据农村粮食购销的实际需要，合理地调整粮食收购点和供应点，不仅可以加强粮食工作的计划性，节省大量运费，而且可以大大地便利农民。
    湖南省平江县粮食部门在今年新粮开始入库的时候，为了农民送粮方便，有计划地增设了一批收粮点。最近，这个县的粮食部门为了便利农民卖粮和买粮，又设立了一批“留乡粮库”。这种粮库设立在离供应点较远、而又有仓库或空房的乡。它的任务是：就地保管和就地供应粮食。现在，这个县已有六个区的“留乡粮库”开始收粮。
    这个办法受到了广大农民的拥护。这个县安定区福寿乡和尚山乡的农民，过去都要把粮食送到三十里以外的粮库去；缺粮农民买粮也要跑十五里或二十里的路。不论买粮或卖粮，都要翻山越岭，很不方便。现在，政府根据这两个乡的粮食“定购”“定销”数目，在福寿乡设立了一个粮库。这样，许多农民走出大门就可以交粮或买粮，最远的也只要走六里路就行了。在修理仓房时，附近的农民自动地拿出木板和杉木帮助政府修理仓库。农民郑延勋说：“人民政府处处为我们着想，我们一定要把护粮组建立起来，把我们自己的粮食保护好！”
