Xinhua News Agency, 4th. According to Kyodo News Agency, the Japanese ship "Kouan Maru," carrying more than 150 Overseas Chinese returning to their homeland, set sail from Maizuru Port at noon on the 4th for China.

On the 3rd, three organizations—the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan Peace Liaison Council, and the Japan-China Friendship Association—exchanged a memorandum with the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association regarding the resolution of the repatriation issue for five Overseas Chinese, including Hong Jinshan. The memorandum stated: "Regarding the repatriation of Overseas Chinese in Japan, the Japanese government also recognizes the principle of respecting the individuals’ free will. The three organizations will not violate this principle when handling the repatriation of Overseas Chinese and will assist Overseas Chinese in returning to their homeland."

The memorandum stated that regarding Hong Jinshan, Pan Guangkun, Gu Minsheng, Guo Quanzao, and Cai Jinxiu, "it is believed that they have the will to return to the mainland of the People's Republic of China." Therefore, the three organizations will "respect their free will and make efforts to enable them to return home in the near future." The memorandum also stated: "Regarding Hong Jinshan, the government has provided reliable guarantees that he will be released immediately after the Kouan Maru leaves Moji Port. Therefore, the three organizations will request his prompt release, and the Japanese Red Cross Society will be responsible for receiving Hong Jinshan. Until Hong Jinshan returns home according to his free will, the three organizations will guarantee his life and physical safety."

On the evening of the 3rd, the returning Overseas Chinese, who had originally refused to board the ship in protest against the Japanese authorities' detention of Hong Jinshan and the other four Overseas Chinese, held a meeting in Maizuru and decided to accept the guarantees proposed in the memorandum.

    华侨一百五十多名搭乘日轮“兴安丸”回国
    新华社四日讯　据共同社报道，载送一百五十多名华侨回国的日本轮船“兴安丸”已经在四日中午从舞鹤港启碇前来中国。
    三日，日本红十字会、日本和平联络会、日中友好协会三个团体就解决洪进山等五名华侨返国问题同东京华侨总会交换了一项备忘录。备忘录中说：“关于在日华侨回国一事，日本政府也承认根据本人自由意志这样的原则，三团体将不违反这项处理华侨回国事宜的原则，帮助华侨回国。”
    备忘录说：关于洪进山、潘广坤、顾敏生、郭全灶、蔡晋修等五人，“认为他们有着要回到中华人民共和国本土的意志”，因此，三团体将“尊重他们的自由意志，作出努力，使他们能在最近期间回国”。备忘录还说：“关于洪进山，政府已经提出可靠保证，说在兴安丸离开门司港以后即行释放，所以三团体将要求迅速予以释放，由日本红十字会负责接受洪进山，在洪进山根据他的自由意志回国以前，由三团体保障他的生命和身体安全。”
    三日晚，原来为抗议日本当局拘留洪进山等五名华侨而拒绝登船的归国华侨在舞鹤举行了大会，决定同意备忘录中提出的保证。
