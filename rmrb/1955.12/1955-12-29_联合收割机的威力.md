    The Power of the Combine Harvester
    Haimo

    Unfortunately, I arrived a day late. Last night, the farm's production team leader and the combine harvester driver held their wedding ceremony. The youth shock brigade members in the farm vividly described the wedding atmosphere. Everyone rushed to tell me: "We hung an apple from the roof beam with a red string..." A short-haired girl in a purple floral cotton jacket with a zippered front said, "We made them both try to bite it together, guess what? The bride ended up making fun of us..."
    Before she could finish, another girl chimed in: "Wow, that bride is really something!" This girl wasn't very tall, but she spoke like she was banging a small drum: "She called out all of our names: 'Wu Yuzhen, when are you and Liu Quan going to bite an apple too?' Wu Yuzhen ran away in a flash. 'Chen Dazui, shouldn't you make your relationship public?' His big mouth clamped shut. 'Zhang Yurong, be careful, I'll tell all your flaws to your future mother-in-law!' Zhang Yurong disappeared into the crowd like an eel, never to be pulled out again...."
      "Humph! You girls are really useless." The boy who spoke had a really rough voice: "The male shock brigade members saw this and immediately held an emergency meeting, determined to fight back. After discussing, we firmly demanded that the new groom and bride kiss in front of us – don't laugh, comrade, the new term should be 'kissing' – we wouldn't give up without a kiss!"
      "What was the outcome?" I asked. Seeing the eagerness of these young men, I felt that they could achieve anything they set their minds to.
      "Sigh! Don't even mention it!" He continued, "That woman is really something. She went up and wrapped her arm around the man's neck and said: 'Wu Yuzhen, didn't you do the same thing behind the haystack that time...'" Saying this, she quickly kissed our production team leader. See, in the end, she turned the tables on us, and Wu Yuzhen, who had just returned, ran away again."
    It's a pity I missed the wedding; I didn't get to see that scene. To make up for this shortcoming, I decided to offer my belated congratulations to the newlyweds' home. Leaving the farm office, crossing a surprisingly large yard, I could see in the distance two thatched houses with doors and windows newly painted in blue. This house was very ordinary in this area. Only the red paper cuttings pasted on the windows indicated that this was the newlyweds' home.
    It was so quiet in front of the house. It was the beginning of December, and in this area of southern Heilongjiang, the severe cold had forced people indoors. Moreover, the farm had recently finished delivering manure, and the masses were brewing next year's production plans. Therefore, these days became the most leisurely days of the year.
    I opened the blue door and gently walked into the outer room. In the outer room, I could already hear the sounds from inside the house: "Open the square... five two eight nine..." Not wanting to disturb the hosts, I tiptoed into the room.
    The winter sun shone into the room, making the new bedding, the floral picture frames, and the colorful lacquered dressing case particularly dazzling, intensifying the atmosphere of the new home.
    From behind, I saw the young production team leader's focused learning posture. He leaned against the stack of quilts on the floor, sitting on a carpenter's stool. He hooked one foot in the stool's eye and put the other foot on the edge of the heated brick bed, with half of his body sprawled on the bed. In good conscience, this wasn't an ideal place to study, and this posture was so awkward. It could be seen that studying was somewhat forced for this young man; he must have changed positions many times before settling down like this.
    He was wearing a red velvet shirt, paired with surprisingly large leather shoes. I accidentally bumped the threshold, which made him turn around. When he saw me, he suddenly stood up. His movements were very quick, and he reached out and grabbed my hands. His fingers were stained with ink that had seeped from a leaky fountain pen, leaving several blue fingerprints on my hands. Although I wasn't short, he was a head taller than me. "Congratulations!" I said with a smile.
      "Oh, comrade, please sit down!" The production team leader had a rectangular face and wasn't bad looking, but his eyebrows were furrowed, and even his smile looked worried. But the way he spoke changed one's perception; from his voice and demeanor, you could tell at a glance that he was an honest and kind person.
      "That's great, marrying a combine harvester operator," I patted his broad back and pulled him down to sit.
      "Don't even mention it; that combine harvester has really given me a hard time!" His eyebrows furrowed again.
    His words were a bit sudden, and I didn't quite understand whether he was referring to the combine harvester itself or the person driving it. However, seeing his frank appearance, one wouldn't think that he was complaining about new things. This was good, as it saved me a lot of time asking questions gradually and allowed me to immediately delve into his and the combine harvester operator's love history.
    "You probably know," the young man clearly regarded me as someone who already knew everything! "By 1953, we had established three cooperatives here. Later, our cooperative took a step forward and established a collective farm. The agricultural machinery station came here to build a station. After our farm and several cooperatives discussed it, we started consolidating the land into contiguous plots to make it easier for tractors to plow and plant! Then, we and several cooperatives sowed wheat on all the adjacent land. The wheat grew so well; from a distance, it looked like a green velvet. When we sowed, it was easy to calculate how much land each cooperative had and how much seed they should provide. The superiority of the tractor was truly evident; it was all sown in less than two days. But when it came to harvesting, the masses panicked. Such a large piece of land; if it was harvested too early, the wheat would still be green; if it was harvested too late, a heavy rain would ruin it all in the fields. After much thought, everyone could only request the agricultural machinery station to send a combine harvester. But the station chief didn't reply, saying: 'Don't just wait to wear new shoes barefoot and end up pricking your feet; you still have to deal with broken shoes for a few days!' We said that wouldn't work; if you don't come, we wouldn't dare to sow so much wheat."
    He paused slightly at this point. I said, "Tell me first how you met this combine harvester operator."
    "Isn't that what I'm getting to," he continued, "We were classmates in elementary school." He pointed to the picture in the frame on the wall.
    It was more like a picture poster than a picture frame. The photos in the frame were piled on top of each other, horizontal and diagonal, with a layout somewhat like the early "Liangyou" pictorial magazine. I noticed this frame, which saved me a lot of questions. It could be seen that the two owners had arranged the pictures in chronological order. The top two pictures were probably taken right after graduating from elementary school. People here have a habit of writing a small caption on the side of each photo. The bride had two small braids at that time, and the caption was: "Strive for agricultural mechanization." The caption on the man's picture was more general: "Create a bright ideal."
    I guessed that the woman probably had a definite future after graduation, while the man was still undecided. So I asked, "Your lover probably went to learn how to drive a combine harvester after graduation?"
      "That's right! She was so lucky; the county committee only wanted one woman from our village, saying that the male quota was full."
      "You still haven't told me about your relationship!"
    The young man blushed. Such a tall and sturdy young man, when shy, was as bashful as a girl. He only knew how to touch his burning cheeks, unable to say a word for a long time. After a full two minutes, he regained his composure. To avoid my further questioning, he became very serious, straightened his face, and lowered his head slightly: "Actually, there's nothing between us. Young people all have ideals. We just felt that we could talk to each other when we met, that we were compatible in conversation! ... Then she left. But from the moment she left, I felt like someone was pushing me, thinking: if I don't achieve something in agriculture, I'll be laughed at! Comrade, you don't know, she has such a proud spirit; if she looks down on someone, she can deflate them with just a few words."
    "So you became a model cooperative member because you were afraid of being deflated by her?"
    This question stunned him. He glanced at me askance, and finally adopted a dismissive attitude and continued: "I figured, young people, having learned culture, always have that kind of energy. The more you say I can't do it, the more I want to show you what I can do, otherwise I'll be losing face for the country. I feel that this is an ideal..."
    His attitude made me feel somewhat apologetic, feeling that I shouldn't have joked with this honest young man. Now, I had no choice but to avoid his gaze. On the wall, I noticed the two photos below. The woman was sitting on a tractor, while the man was somewhat comical, plowing the field shirtless. After seeing them, I couldn't help but feel embarrassed for the young man. He had been left behind by the tractor: one was working with modern production tools, and the other was working with ancient methods. At this moment, the young man spoke again: "She learned it and was at a state-owned farm. This time, she was assigned to our place. Let me continue where I left off. To welcome the combine harvester, we put up a colorful archway at the entrance of the village, and the children blocked both sides of the road like a fence. First, we heard a rumbling sound. Our village has a hill in front, and when the combine harvester appeared, my goodness, it kept getting bigger and bigger, as tall as a two-story building. When it got closer, we saw that the driver was her! Can you believe it? I was both happy and embarrassed. Look, she has progressed, but what about me..." I said: "You're not bad either! You're already the farm's production team leader!"
     "Sigh! If I wasn't called this team leader, I wouldn't be so ashamed. I'm responsible for labor allocation. Now I have to contact her again. You say this really controlled us. The combine harvester is good, but our land is in scattered ridges and strips, and one cooperative's land is divided into two or three parts. We decided to harvest Red Star Cooperative's land first. That combine harvester isn't a small object. When it encountered the first piece of land in this cooperative, it went diagonally, and in a flash, the combine harvester entered Red Flag Cooperative. What to do? The grain couldn't be divided properly. There was no choice but to stop the combine harvester and quickly measure the extra harvested land, estimate how many dou of grain this piece of land could produce, and then pour it out of the bin and return it to Red Flag Cooperative. But that combine harvester couldn't stay idle; the machine was rattling non-stop, and our combine harvester driver's mouth wasn't one to save oil, sitting on top and constantly shouting: 'Cost, cost, how much oil is this wasting.' When it got to Red Flag Cooperative's land, it was divided into three places. After harvesting this piece of land, they had to make a big turn to go to that piece of land. The land wasn't wide enough for a road, so driving straight through would ruin the crops, but harvesting like that wouldn't be able to balance the accounts. After a busy morning, it was only after much difficulty that the land of this cooperative was harvested, but who knew that the next cooperative hadn't prepared all the sacks yet. Although the combine harvester harvested like this and wasted a lot of time, it was still much faster than our farmers had estimated. Everyone was busy watching the excitement and forgot about preparing the sacks. In addition, the harvested land was in great chaos. The old labor organization was no longer effective. Some people were bundling individual stalks, but there were no carts to haul them back. The combine harvester kept putting the wheat stalks on the ground in piles like small houses, and people were anxiously unable to haul them back. When the carts finally came, they were busy hauling the threshed grain. What was most frustrating was that after harvesting one cooperative's wheat, they had to knock and tap the bin before they could harvest the next cooperative's. As a result, they harvested less than five shang of land a day. My goodness, the most difficult person in all of this was me, the one in charge of labor allocation. Urging this one, neglecting that one, finding that one, lacking this one. Running around in a sweat, my legs aching, I still couldn't meet the requirements. It was really frustrating. You jumped and urged him to work, but he wasn't worried, and said: 'Let me see, what's the rush!' It's said that our agricultural machinery station chief is really a good person; he was worried and kept clicking his tongue, saying: 'Don't panic, we're just testing it... don't panic!' But our combine harvester driver's mouth couldn't stay idle: 'Your thinking is too backward. I told you to study hard... How did I tell you! You are deliberately wasting state property... We're going back. If we had known this, we wouldn't have come. You're almost like primitive humans...' See how provocative her words are. Once she starts, it's endless, one sentence after another, like nails constantly hammered into me. Fortunately, in the end, our farm finally gained some face. Our land was already connected into one piece, twenty-nine shang, without bends or narrow strips. The combine harvester went into the field at seven o'clock in the morning, and the combine harvester returned to the agricultural machinery station before the lights were lit. It was also a coincidence that as soon as the combine harvester arrived home, it started to rain heavily, and it rained for five consecutive days. From then on, without any mobilization, the masses were clamoring: land must be connected into one piece, and advanced cooperatives must be established!"
    "The power of this combine harvester is really not small!" I laughed as I listened: "Forcing you to move towards collective farms!"
    "That's right! After that, people from higher up came, and the other two cooperatives also joined our farm!"
    "Then, did this combine harvester also force you to get married?"
    Hearing this, our production team leader also laughed. He seemed to want to tell me more, but at this moment, a burst of silver bell-like laughter came from outside, followed by the sound of the door banging. Our production team leader quickly waved his hand at me and turned back to his calculations. Because I was sitting on the edge of the heated brick bed by the door, the bride didn't notice me at first.
    "Just staying here, so old, only know how to play, have you calculated it? If you don't hurry up and progress, we won't wait for you! Still welcoming new machines? If you don't improve your technology, planting according to the requirements of the tractor... Oh! I didn't see there was someone here!"
    Fortunately, she discovered me, otherwise, I would really be worried about this young man. Now that she turned around, I saw her appearance clearly. To be honest, the person was very different from her tone. Looking at her, she still looked like an elementary school student, with a round face and two eyebrows in a straight line. She wasn't tall, and her figure wasn't bulky. If the cotton clothes weren't too puffy, her figure would definitely be very slender.
    As soon as she saw me, she asked head-on: "You're the new reporter, right! I'll give you some material. Tell me, the farm's production always can't keep up with the requirements of the tractor. Shouldn't it be criticized? I'm telling you, write this down. The first thing you have to do is 'praise' 'praise' our great production team leader..."
    Seeing that she was bound to speak endlessly, I had no choice but to help our male friend out of the predicament: "I'm not here to interview about this. I heard that you two are the first couple in our village to get married by free love..." Asking this, I myself doubted my question. The girl was like an arrow leaving the bow, running too fast, I felt a little like I couldn't catch up.
    "You say we're free love, I don't feel free!"
    This made me even more confused. To help the production team leader, I also launched an offensive: "I heard a long time ago that you took the initiative, is there such a thing? Huh?" Girls are girls after all, she blushed.
    Originally, the farm chairman had already described their love story to me last night, and this morning, the youth shock brigade members added to it, making me very respectful of both of them. The man was so down-to-earth and hardworking, and the production team he led always overfulfilled its tasks. The girl was so bold and loyal, although she was somewhat sharp and conceited, but everyone also analyzed that the girls loved this kind of reliable young man who would never change his mind. Wu Yuzhen's home, which was mentioned earlier, was the place where they often met, and Wu Yuzhen heard everything they said, and Wu Yuzhen even complained for the young man. Listen to how pitiful the man said at that time: "Is someone like me still okay? You've scolded me enough, looked down on me." Guess what the woman said: "I have to test you a little." "Then you don't have any opinions about me?" the man asked again. "Opinions are opinions, the partner is the partner, the person is honest, and that's enough!"
    From my point of view, these situations seemed too simple, so I wanted to ask these two young people to introduce more about their own situations. Now it was a miscalculation. With my mention, she hastily made a summary and repeated the two sentences that Wu Yuzhen heard: "Opinions are opinions, the partner is the partner, the person is honest, and that's enough!"
    "Then why do you always bully him, look down on him?"
      "Comrade, look at what you're saying," she put her hands on her hips and widened her eyes: "Didn't you hear Chairman Mao say that the high tide of rural socialist construction is coming, can you build socialism just by being honest? Why do I say it's not free, I only saw that he was honest and took a liking to him, now I see that just being honest is not enough, you have to be willing to study. You don't know, this person is like a fire under his butt, can't sit still. But, at this time, it's too late for me to regret..." Saying this, she playfully turned her head and stared at the production team leader: "Only know how to listen to nagging, calculate quickly, you said yourself to let me teach you, but you're not seriously learning, calculate quickly!"
    "So powerful!" I couldn't help but say. I thought: this young man doesn't seem as backward as she said, the production team he led in the past was simply a miracle, with many people in the team exceeding three hundred workdays. But why is he afraid of this little girl? I couldn't find the answer for a while, I could only think secretly: "Perhaps this is due to the power of the combine harvester!"
    Fortunately, the young shock brigade members later provided me with a supplementary material, which made my answer more objective. After this visit, a young man inadvertently overheard a conversation between them. The conversation was started by the woman. After arguing with our production team leader for a while, she suddenly asked softly and somewhat timidly: "Is there a reply to my application to join the Party?" Here, it should be explained that the production team leader is a Party member and a member of the village branch committee, but the combine harvester operator is still a member of the Communist Youth League.
    "What do you think the reply should be?" When it came to this question, the production team leader's speech had more weight.
    "You're really putting me on the spot; you can just point out my shortcomings!"
    "You, old problem, not stable in work, like to show off in front of people."
    "You can't take personal revenge, shouldn't I urge you to study?"
    "This shortcoming of yours isn't just at home, it hasn't changed much since you went to study."
    "Then can't I change it in the future? I'll listen to you in the future."
    "Do you know?" the man said: "In front of people, I give in to you. I ask you, did you learn to study in one day?"
    "Don't grab other people's pigtails and not let go, so annoying!"
    I think this supplement is very good. It turns out there is still a force that can control the combine harvester operator!

    联合收割机的威力
    海默
    可惜我来晚了一天，昨天晚上农庄生产队长和联合收割机驾驶手举行了结婚仪式，农庄中的青年突击队员们把婚礼的气氛描写得活灵活现，大家抢着向我介绍：“我们在房梁上用红头绳吊了个苹果……”一个穿对襟拉锁紫花小棉袄的短头发姑娘说：“我们让他们两人一块去啃，你猜怎样？倒让新娘子把我们作践了一顿……”
    她的话音没有落，一个小姑娘又接过话去：“吓，那新娘子可真厉害呀！”这个姑娘个子不高，说起话来却像敲小鼓似的叭叭响：“她把我们这帮人的名字都点到了：‘吴玉珍，你跟刘全什么时候也啃苹果呀？’吴玉珍一溜烟就吓跑了。‘陈大嘴，你那对象该公开了吧？’这一下子他那大嘴也张不开了。‘张玉蓉，小心我把你的缺点都告诉你没过门的老婆婆！’张玉蓉就像泥鳅似的，一头钻到人缝里再也拉不出来了。……”
      “哼！你们丫头家可真不争气。”说话的男孩子嗓门可真叫粗：“我们男突击队员一看，连忙开了个紧急小会，说什么也得打个翻身仗，大伙一合计，坚决要求新姑爷和新娘子当着我们面亲个嘴——同志别笑话啊，新名词该叫接吻，——不接吻我们誓不甘休啊！”
      “战果怎么样？”我问。我一看这些小伙子的虎势劲，就觉得他说到哪里就能办到哪里。
      “咳！别提啦！”他接着说：“人家女方可真有两下子，上去把男的脖子一搂就说：‘吴玉珍，你们那次在草垛子后边是不是也……’说到这儿，叭达亲了我们生产队长一下。你看，临了还叫她倒打了一棒子，吴玉珍刚返回来又吓跑了。”
    可惜婚礼已经错过了，我没能看见这个场面，为了补救这个缺陷，我决心到新房去贺个晚喜。出了农庄办公室的大门，穿过一个大得惊人的场院，就远远看见一座用蓝色油漆新油过门窗的两间草房。这房子在这一带是很普通的。只有窗上贴的红色剪纸标示出这儿是新房。
    房前是那样安静。这是十二月初的天气，在黑龙江南部这一带，严寒早把人们都逼进屋里了，尤其农庄最近已将粪送完，群众正在酝酿来年的生产计划，因此，这些天成了一年中最闲适的日子。
    我拉开蓝色的门，轻轻地走进外屋。在外屋，我已听见了屋里的声音了：“开方…五二八九…”为了不惊动主人，我用脚尖向屋里走去。
    冬天的阳光射进满屋，照得房中的新被褥、花镜框、彩漆的梳妆匣格外刺眼，使得屋中的新房气氛更加浓烈了。
    从背后，我看见了那个年青的生产队长聚精会神的学习姿态。他靠着地上的被垛子，坐在一条作木匠活用的板凳上。他一只脚别在凳子眼里，一只脚上了炕沿，上半个身子又整爬在炕上。凭良心说，这可不算理想的学习地方，而且这姿势又是这样蹩扭。可以看出学习对这个青年尚有些勉强，他一定是翻来覆去换了多次姿势才这样坐下来的。
    他穿着一身红绒衣，脚下配着一双大得出奇的皮鞋，我不小心碰了一下门槛，才使他回过头来。他看见我，猛然站起身来。他的动作很敏捷，上前就拉住了我的双手。他的手指上染满了由于钢笔“拉稀”渗出的墨水，因此给我手上也打了几个蓝色的指印。按说我的个子不算低了，可是跟他一比，他却比我高了一头。“给你贺喜来了！”我笑着说。
      “哎呀，同志，快坐下吧！”生产队长是长方脸，人不算难看，可惜眉毛拧在一起，笑起来也像发愁。可是他一说话，使人的感觉就变了，从他的声音和姿态，使你一眼就能看出他是个老实厚道人。
      “真不错啊，和联合收割机手结了婚。”我拍了拍他宽大的后背，拉着他坐下来。
      “可别提啦，这联合收割机可把我整苦了！”他的眉毛又拧起来了。
    他这话有些突然，我还没搞明白，他究竟指的是联合收割机本身，还是指的驾驶它的人。不过，一看他那坦率的样子，还不会使人觉得他对新鲜事物有埋怨。这也好，这节省了我很多逐步询问时间，一下子就接触到他和联合收割机手的恋爱历史上了。
    “你大概知道了。”小伙子显然把我看成是已经了解一切真象的人了！“到一九五三年，我们这儿就成立了三个社。后来，我们社前进了一步，成立了集体农庄。农业机器站来我们这儿建站，我们庄和几个社一合计就搞开了土地连片了，为的好让拖拉机翻、拖拉机种啊！接着，我们又和几个社把挨在一起的地都播了麦子。这麦子长的才叫好呢，老远一看就像一片绿色金丝绒。我们播的时候，哪一个社有多少地，该出多少种子也好算账，可真看出拖拉机的优越性来了，不到两天全部播完了。可是，一到了割的时候，群众就慌了，这么一大片地，割早了，麦子还发青，割晚了，一场大雨都得瞎在地里。大家想来想去只有要求农业机器站派一部联合收割机来。但站长不答复，他说：‘你们别净等光着脚穿新鞋弄得扎了脚，还得把破鞋对付着使两天呀！’我们说，这不行啊，你们要是不来，我们还不敢播这么多麦子呢。”
    他说到这儿，稍微停顿了一下，我说：“你先说说和这位联合收割机手怎么认识的吧。”
    “这不是就说到了，”他接着说：“在初级小学里，我们俩是同学。”他指了指墙上镜框里的像片。
    与其说这是像片框，还不如说这像张画报。框里的照片一个压着一个，横的、斜的，排版格式有点像早先年的“良友”画刊。我一注意到这像框却省了我好多问题，可以看出这两位主人是照历史次序把像片编排起来的。最上面的两张大概是初小刚毕业时拍的。这儿的人们有个习惯，每张像片一边都喜欢写一行小小的题字。新娘子那时还留着两条小辫，题字是：“为农业机械化奋斗”。男的像片上的题字却有些一般化：“创造光明理想”。
    我猜出来了，大概女的一毕业就有了确定的前途，而男的还拿不定主意。于是我问：“你的爱人大概是一毕业就去学开联合收割机了吧？”
      “可不！人家多走运，县委只向我们村要了一名妇女，说男的名额满了。”
      “你还没说到你们两人的关系啊！”
    青年脸红了，这样个高大魁伟的青年，羞起来腼腆得像个姑娘。他只知道摸着烧红的脸颊，半天说不出一句话来，停了足有两分钟他才恢复了平常神态，为了避免我追问，他态度变得很严肃了，把脸一板，微微低下了头：“其实我们俩也没有啥，青年人谁没有个理想，我们就觉着见了面能把话说到一块，谈话对眼了呗！……紧接着她就走了。不过有一宗，从她一走，我就好像有什么人推着似的，一心想：要不在农业上干出点成绩来，还不得叫人家笑话死！同志，你不知道，她可有那么个骄傲劲，要说看不上谁，两句话就能把人说扁了。”
    “这么说你是怕她说扁了才当上模范社员的？”
    这一句话把他问得愣住了，他斜睨了我两眼，最后采取了个不答理我的态度说了下去：“我寻思，青年人嘛，又学了文化，心里总有那么股子劲，你越说我不行，我越要作出个样来看看，要不然丢的是国家的脸哪，我觉着这就是个理想……”
    他的态度使我有些抱歉，觉得不该对这敦厚的青年开这种玩笑。现在，我只好避开他的眼光。在墙上，我又注意到下面的两张照片，女的是坐在拖拉机上照的，男的却有些滑稽，光着膀子在锄地。我看完后不禁暗暗替这个青年不好意思。他让拖拉机拉下了，一个是用近代化的生产工具劳动，一个是在用古老的方法劳动。在这时候，青年又说了起来：“人家是学成了，在国营农场，这次才拨到我们这儿。我还接着刚才说吧，我们为了迎接联合收割机来，村口上扎起了彩牌坊，小孩跟篱笆墙似地把大道两边都堵满了。先听见的是轰隆隆响，我们村前是个岗子，联合收割机一露头，我的妈呀，越来越大，赶上两层小楼高了。等开近了才看见驾驶手原来是她！你说巧不巧，我是又高兴又不好意思，看，人家进步了，而我呢……”我说：“你也不坏呀！已经是农庄的生产队长了嘛！”
     “唉！要不叫这队长，我还不会那么害臊呢。我负责劳力调拨，这一来我又不能不去和她接头。你说这可把我们制住了。联合收割机倒是好，可是我们的地是东一垅西一条，一个社的地分成两三下。我们决定先给红星社收。那联合收割机不是小物件，遇上这社里的头一块地就是个抹斜子，一出溜，联合收割机进了红旗社了。这可怎么好呢？这粮食算分不过来了。没法子只好让联合收割机停下来，赶忙把多割了的地量一下，估一下这块地能收几斗粮，再从箱子里倒出来找给红旗社。可那联合收割机在这闲不住啊，机器突突的直响，我们这位联合收割机手的嘴又不是个省油的灯，坐在上边一个劲叫：‘成本啊，成本啊，这得多费多少油啊。’赶上了红旗社的地又分成三个地方，这块地割完了，还得拐个大弯到那块地去，地里又没那么宽的道，直开过去毁了庄稼，收割过去，又算不过账来了。忙了一头晌，好容易这个社的地算割完了，谁知道下一个社还没准备齐口袋呢。虽然联合收割机这样割误了不少工，可也比咱们庄稼人估计的快得多。大家光顾看热闹，就把准备口袋撇到脑后了。另外割完了的地里忙乱得也厉害啦，旧劳动组织不顶事了，有捆个子的没有车往回拉，联合收割机一整蒲子一整蒲子把麦秸放在地上跟一座一座小房子似的，干着急拉不回去，好容易大车来了，还得忙着拉打好了的粮食。顶叫人发急的是：这一个社的麦子收完了，还得敲打敲打箱子才能再收那个社的。结果，一天割了不到五垧地。我的妈呀，这里头最作难的还是我这个管劳力调拨的人。催了这个拉下那个，找来那个又缺这个。跑了一头汗，累得两腿发酸，还是达不到要求。可真急死人哪，你跳着脚催他干活去，他也不着急，还说：‘让我看看，忙什么的！’按说咱们农业机器站站长可真是好人，他愁得直吧哒嘴，嘴里还说：‘别慌，咱们这是试用……别慌！’可是我们那位联合收割机手的嘴闲不住呀：‘你们的思想太落后了，我早说让你们好好学习学习……我怎么告诉你的来！你们是成心浪费国家财产啊……我们开回去了，早知道这样，我们不来了，你们快赶上原始人类了……’你看她这话头子多带刺激性，一说起来算没有完了，一句接着一句，简直就像钉子似的一个劲往我身上钉。还算不离，最后临到我们农庄才算争了一口气。我们那地早连成了片，二十九垧，没弯没夹条，早七点联合收割机下了地，不到掌灯联合收割机开回农业机器站里去了。也真巧，联合收割机一到家，这里可就下起大雨来了，一连下了五天。从这以后群众不用动员，都嚷嚷开了：非土地连片不行啊，非成立高级社不行啊！”
    “这联合收割机的威力可真不小啊！”我听得笑起来了：“逼着你们往集体农庄走啊！”
    “可不！从那以后上级来了人，另外两个社也加入了我们农庄了！”
    “那，是不是这联合收割机也逼着你们结婚呢？”
    说到这里，我们的生产队长也笑了，他似乎想对我讲下去，可是这时外面传来了一阵银铃似的笑声，紧接着听见门铛鎯一响，我们的生产队长连忙向我摆了摆手，转身又伏在他正在演算的算草上。我因为坐在门边炕沿上，所以新娘子先没发现我。
    “又呆着，那么大了，光知道玩，算出来没有？你要不赶快进步我们可不等你！还欢迎新机器呢，你们不提高技术，照着拖拉机的要求种地……哎哟！我还没看见这儿还有个人呢！”
    幸亏她发现了我，要不然我真为这小伙子担心。她现在一回头，我看清她的模样了。说实在的，人可跟她的口气差了很多。看人，还像个小学生，圆圆的脸，两根眉毛成了一条直线。她个子不高，身材并不粗大，如果不是棉衣过于膨胀，她的身材一定是很苗条的。
    她一看见我，劈头就问：“你是新来的记者吧！我贡献你个材料，你说，农庄的生产老是赶不上拖拉机的要求，是不是得好好批评批评呢？我跟你说，你记上，头一个先得‘表扬’‘表扬’我们这位大生产队长……”
    我见她势必要滔滔不绝地说下去，只好替我们这位男性朋友解围：“我可不是来访问这个的，听说你们俩是咱们村第一对自由恋爱结婚的……”问到这儿，我自己都对我的问题怀疑了。女孩子像离了弓的箭，跑得太快了，我都有点觉得追不上。
    “你说我们是自由恋爱呀，我觉着可不自由啦！”
    这话更把我弄糊涂了，为了帮助生产队长一臂之力，我也展开了攻势：“我早听说了，听说还是你主动呢，有没有这个事？啊？”女孩子究竟是女孩子，她脸红起来了。
    本来，昨天晚上农庄主席已经向我叙述了一遍他们的恋爱经过，今天早上又经青年突击队员们一补充，使我对他们两人都很崇敬。男的是那样踏实肯干，他领导的生产队总是超额完成任务。女孩子又是那样泼辣忠实，虽然未免有些尖刻自大，可是大伙也分析过，姑娘们爱的就是这样牢靠的小伙子，百辈子不会变心的。刚才提的那个吴玉珍家里，就是他们两个人常会面的地方，他们说什么话吴玉珍都听见了，吴玉珍还替男孩子叫过屈呢。你听男的那时说得多叫人怜惜啊：“咱这样的还行啊，都叫你骂够了，瞧扁了。”你猜女的怎么说：“我不兴考验考验你。”“那末你对我没意见啦？”男的又问。“意见归意见，对象归对象，人实在就中啊！”
    从我的观点上看这些情况总嫌太简单了些，所以我想请这两位青年人多介绍一些自己的情况。现在失策了，经我这一提，她却草草率率地作了总结，又把吴玉珍听见的那两句话重复了一遍：“意见归意见，对象归对象，人实在就中呗！”
    “那你为什么老是欺负人家，瞧不起人家？”
      “同志，看你这话说的，”她叉起腰瞪起大眼睛：“你没听毛主席说，农村社会主义建设高潮到啦，光凭老实能建设社会主义吗？我为啥说不自由呢，早先我是光看他老实才相中了他，这会儿一看，光老实还不行，还得肯学习。你才不知道呢，他这个人简直是个火烧屁股，坐不住。可是，这时候我后悔也来不及了，……”她说到这儿，俏皮地回头盯了生产队长一眼：“光知道听唠喀，快算哪，你自己说的让我教你，你又不正经学，快算！”
    “好厉害呀！”我不禁说了一句。我心想：这位青年按说也不像她说的那样落后啊，他过去领导的生产队简直是个奇迹，队中有不少人超过了三百多个劳动日。可是为什么他却怕这个小姑娘呢，我一时找不出答案，只能暗暗地想：“也许这是由于联合收割机的威力吧！”
    幸亏事后青年突击队的小伙子们又给我提供了一个补充材料，才使我的答案客观了一些。这是在我这次访问后，有一位青年无心地听见了一段他们夫妻的对话。话是女方开的头，她和我们的生产队长辩过一阵嘴之后，突然轻声而又有些怯懦地问道：“我递的入党申请书有答复没有啊？”这里要说明一下，生产队长是党员，并且是村支部委员，但联合收割机手还是团员。
    “你自己觉得该怎么答复呢？”一谈到这个问题，生产队长的讲话就有份量多了。
    “你可真拿人，我有啥缺点你就提得了呗！”
    “你呀，老毛病，工作不稳重，好在人跟前表现自己。”
    “你可不兴个人报复啊，我不该催你学习吗？”
    “你这缺点也不是在家里才有，从你去学习就没大改。”
    “那我以后改还不行吗？我以后听你的话。”
    “你知道不？”男的说：“在人前我是让着你，我问你，你自己学习是不是一天学成的？”
    “你别抓住别人的小辫子不撒手啊，真讨厌！”
    这段补充我觉得很好。原来还有一种能控制联合收割机手的力量呢！
