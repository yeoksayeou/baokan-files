Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Singapore on December 26th, the Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party held an emergency meeting in mid-December. A communique was issued after the meeting. The communique stated that the meeting discussed the issue of peace talks and that a joint delegation of the Malayan Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Malayan National Liberation Army, consisting of Chen Ping, Rashid Maidin, and Chen Tian, was formed, with Chen Ping as the chief representative.

Accompanying the communique was a declaration adopted at the meeting.

The declaration pointed out that since its inception, the Malayan Communist Party has resolutely fought for the independence of Malaya. When Japan occupied Malaya during World War II, the Malayan Communist Party led the masses of people in a heroic struggle against the invaders. After Japan's surrender, the Malayan people eagerly hoped for the birth of an independent Malaya, but this hope was dashed. The British colonial authorities returned to Malaya to restore their colonial rule.

The declaration continued, stating that Britain treated its wartime allies—the Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan people—as enemies, taking a series of repressive measures against them; and in 1948, it even promulgated emergency regulations and launched a colonial war against the people. Under such unbearable circumstances, the Malayan Communist Party led the people in armed resistance to achieve the sacred goal of Malayan independence.

The declaration recounted the suffering the war had brought to the people over the past seven years and the development of the Malayan independence movement. The declaration announced that the Malayan Communist Party is prepared to reach a truce agreement with the British authorities in Malaya, provided that negotiations are conducted on fair and reasonable terms. However, it is unreasonable and unworkable for one party to force the other party to accept amnesty conditions.

The declaration presented an eight-point program for achieving independence, democracy, and peace in Malaya. These eight points include: demanding an end to the war; establishing Malaya's independence as soon as possible; organizing a fully elected legislative assembly to draft a constitution; making Malay the national language; improving the people's livelihood; upholding international peace and practicing peaceful coexistence with other countries, etc.

The declaration concluded by calling on all parties and factions to cooperate with each other to strive for the realization of Malaya's independence, democracy, and peace.

    马来亚共产党中央委员会发表宣言
    提出在马来亚实现独立、民主与和平的八点计划
    新华社二十七日讯　据路透社新加坡二十六日消息，马来亚共产党中央委员会曾经在十二月中旬举行了一次紧急会议。会后发表了一项公报。公报说：会议讨论了和谈问题，并且由陈平、拉昔·迈丁、陈田三人组成马来亚共产党和马来亚民族解放军总部的联合代表团，陈平担任首席代表。
    同公报一起，还发表了这次会议通过的一篇宣言。
    宣言指出，马来亚共产党自从诞生之日起就坚决地为马来亚的独立而奋斗，当第二次世界大战期间日本进占马来亚的时候，马来亚共产党领导人民群众进行了反对侵略者的英勇斗争。在日本投降以后，马来亚人民热望接着诞生一个独立的马来亚，但是，这个希望落了空。英国殖民当局又回到马来亚恢复它的殖民统治。
    宣言继续说，英国把它战时的盟友——马来亚共产党和马来亚人民当做敌人对待，对他们采取了一系列的镇压措施；而在一九四八年甚至还颁布了紧急条例，发动了反对人民的殖民战争。马来亚共产党在这种忍无可忍的情况下，为实现马来亚独立的神圣目标而领导人民进行了武装抵抗。
    宣言叙述了七年多以来战争带给人民的苦难以及马来亚独立运动的发展。宣言宣布：只要马来亚英国当局能按公平合理的条件来进行谈判，马来亚共产党是准备同对方达成一个停战协定的，但是，由一方强迫另一方接受大赦条件是不合理和行不通的。
    宣言陈述了在马来亚实现独立、民主与和平的八点计划。这八点包括：要求结束战争；尽早确立马来亚的独立；组织一个完全由选举产生的立法议会，由它拟定宪法；以马来语为国语；改善人民生活；拥护国际和平，同其他国家实行和平共处等。
    宣言最后要求各党各派互相合作，以争取实现马来亚的独立、民主和和平。
