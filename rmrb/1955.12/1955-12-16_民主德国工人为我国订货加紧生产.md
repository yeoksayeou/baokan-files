    民主德国工人为我国订货加紧生产
    新华社柏林十五日电　据德意志通讯社消息：民主德国接受中国订货的各工厂正在加紧生产，争取提前交货。
     最近几年曾为中国制造了几千架计算机的格拉许特的“阿基米德”计算机工厂的工人正在进行组与组之间和个人与个人之间的竞赛，争取将原来规定在明年一月五日交给中国的一批订货提前到今年十二月二十四日以前交货。
    来比锡起重机工厂今年为中国制造的塔式起重机中的最后三架就将在日内完工起运。勃兰登堡拖拉机工厂已经接受了中国六百辆拖拉机的订货，并且准备开始生产。这个工厂的厂长在谈到德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问中国时说：“中德两国关系的加强将更进一步密切两国之间的贸易关系。”
