Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, via TASS: The Soviet Supreme Soviet's Council of the Union and Council of Nationalities held separate meetings on December 28th, concluding discussions on the draft of the 1956 Soviet State Budget.

    The two chambers unanimously approved the Soviet State Budget after amendments by their respective Budget Committees. The budget stipulates that the total state budget revenue for 1956 is 592,761,115,600 rubles, and the total expenditure is 569,634,972,000 rubles, with revenue exceeding expenditure by 23,126,184,400 rubles.

    The two chambers separately and unanimously approved the report by Soviet Minister of Finance Zverev on the execution of the 1954 Soviet State Budget, and also passed the 1956 Soviet State Budget Law. In addition, they approved the decrees passed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet between the last and current sessions of the Supreme Soviet, and also passed a law repealing certain existing laws.

    In addition, the two chambers separately heard reports from the Chairman of the Council of Nationalities, Lacis, and the Deputy Chairman of the Council of the Union, V. Mzhavanadze, regarding the exchange of delegations between the Soviet Supreme Soviet and foreign parliaments.

    In his report to the Council of Nationalities, Lacis pointed out that the initiative to establish direct contact between parliaments of various countries, as proposed in the declaration passed by the Second Session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet on February 9th of this year, has been supported by the parliaments of many countries. Parliamentary delegations from Finland, the United Kingdom, India, Sweden, Syria, Yugoslavia, Japan, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Albania, and Austria have already visited the Soviet Union at the invitation. Currently, parliamentary delegations from Poland and Iran are visiting the Soviet Union. At the same time, delegations from the Soviet Supreme Soviet have also visited some countries at the invitation of foreign parliaments.

    Lacis said that the results of the mutual visits by parliamentary delegations prove that the Soviet Supreme Soviet's proposal is completely correct. Undoubtedly, this kind of exchange promotes the further strengthening of international ties and promotes a deeper mutual understanding between the peoples of various countries. We hope that this good experience will be further promoted in the future.

    In his report to the Council of the Union, Mzhavanadze pointed out that the parliamentary delegations from various countries who were invited to visit the Soviet Union visited many constituent republics. Everyone who does not harbor prejudice against the policies of the Soviet state is clear that the Soviet Union has not only declared the principle of international cooperation but also strives to practically implement this principle through various channels and possibilities.

    The two chambers launched a discussion on the reports of Lacis and Mzhavanadze. All speakers believed that the mutual visits of parliamentary delegations and other delegations help to consolidate the cause of world peace and help to promote understanding and trust between the peoples of various countries.

    The two chambers unanimously passed a resolution advocating for further expansion of the mutual visits of parliamentary delegations from various countries.

    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯　苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院十二月二十八日分别开会，结束了对一九五六年苏联国家预算草案的讨论。
    两院会议一致通过了经过两院预算委员会修正后的苏联国家预算。预算规定：一九五六年的国家预算收入总额是五千九百二十七亿六千一百一十五万六千卢布，支出总额是五千六百九十六亿三千四百九十七万二千卢布，收入比支出多二百三十一亿二千六百一十八万四千卢布。
    两院会议分别一致批准了苏联财政部长兹维列夫关于一九五四年苏联国家预算的执行情况的报告，并且通过了一九五六年苏联国家预算法。此外，还批准了苏联最高苏维埃主席团在最高苏维埃上次和本次会议之间所通过的命令，并且通过了取消某些现行法令的法律。
    此外，两院会议分别听取了民族院主席拉齐斯和联盟院副主席维·姆扎瓦纳泽作的关于苏联最高苏维埃和外国议会之间互换代表团的报告。
    拉齐斯在民族院会议上作的报告中指出，苏联最高苏维埃第二次会议在今年二月九日通过的宣言所提出的建立各国议会之间的直接接触的倡议，受到了许多国家的议会的支持。芬兰、英国、印度、瑞典、叙利亚、南斯拉夫、日本、比利时、法国、卢森堡、阿尔巴尼亚和奥地利这些国家的议会代表团已经应邀访问了苏联。现在波兰和伊朗的议会代表团正在苏联访问。和这同时，苏联最高苏维埃代表团也应外国议会的邀请访问了一些国家。
    拉齐斯说议会代表团互相访问的结果证明，苏联最高苏维埃的建议是完全正确的。无疑的，这种交往促进了国际联系的进一步加强，促进了各国人民之间更加深刻的互相谅解。我们希望，这种良好经验在将来将会更加推广。
    姆扎瓦纳泽在联盟院所作的报告中指出，应邀访问苏联的各国议会代表团访问了许多加盟共和国。每一个对苏维埃国家的政策不存偏见的人都清楚，苏联不仅仅宣布了国际合作的原则，而且利用各种途径和可能来努力实际执行这个原则。
    两院会议对拉齐斯和姆扎瓦纳泽的报告展开了讨论。所有发言的人都认为，各国议会代表团和其他代表团的互相访问，有助于巩固世界和平事业，有助于促进各国人民之间的谅解和信任。
    两院会议一致通过了一项决议，主张进一步扩大各国议会代表团的相互访问。
