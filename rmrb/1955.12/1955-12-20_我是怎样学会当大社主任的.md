How I Learned to Be a Large Cooperative Director
    Liang Xiangsheng

    Getting Rid of Bureaucracy
    I am the director of the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of the Masses Township in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. In the autumn of 1954, our cooperative suddenly expanded from sixteen households to more than one hundred and thirty households, and my past experience in leading a small cooperative was no longer sufficient.
    When this large cooperative was first put into production, the work was extremely chaotic. Every day, regardless of day or night, a large group of people surrounded me, which made me feel dizzy.
    At that time, I was not very clear about my responsibilities. I would do whatever came up, even personally going to each household when the cooperative members were not showing up for work. I did a lot, but thought little. I was busy and confused, working hard, but there was no plan for the work, and the more I worked, the more chaotic it became.
    So I thought: What should a cooperative director be responsible for? Which link should I grasp first?
    My experience as a cooperative director over the past year told me: I must first grasp the cooperative's production work, so that the cooperative can carry out production in an orderly manner, that is, to grasp the production plan and the organization of labor. Therefore, I concentrated my efforts on grasping these main issues, and assigned other cadres to be responsible for other tasks. For example, the receipt and expenditure of money was handed over to the accountant and cashier; the purchase and rental of boats was the responsibility of the deputy director; and the daily task assignment for each cooperative member was also discussed in advance with the team leaders and group leaders, and they were responsible for carrying it out. This freed me from many daily affairs.

    You Can't Just Rely on Your Own Leadership in Production
    Although I realized that my primary responsibility was to do a good job in production, how to deeply lead production was still a big problem. When leading the small cooperative of sixteen households, I personally participated in production and led by example. At that time, I considered the work arrangements for the entire cooperative while producing. At most, I would finish work a little earlier and go around each field. In this way, I would have a good understanding of any problems in production and what should be done in the next stage, and how to arrange manpower. Starting from this experience, I thought that as long as I personally participated in production and took the lead in everything, I could lead production well. In the initial period after the cooperative expanded, I personally participated in the production of the first group of the first production team, getting up early every day to call the cooperative members to work. However, this kind of leadership could not drive more than one hundred households and more than three hundred cooperative members in the entire cooperative. On the contrary, the result of burying myself in working in one production group was that I did not understand the situation of the entire cooperative at all. In this way, there was no way to arrange work in a planned way.
    At this time, I began to realize that going deep into field production should be for the purpose of grasping the situation, discovering problems, and leading production, rather than simply playing a leading role. In order to achieve this goal, I changed the method of burying myself in production in one production group, and adopted the "field inspection" method. Every day, I would go around to each farming area to see the production mood of the cooperative members in each team, talk to the team leaders and cooperative members, and understand the situation.

    Go Deep into the Fields with a Purpose
    In the first few days of field inspection, I discovered many problems.
    The first was that many team leaders and group leaders lacked the ability to allocate and direct labor, and did not know how to divide temporary work groups according to work needs. For example, shoveling river mud could be done very well with only seven people. However, some teams put fourteen people together to pass the mud, and the second group of the second team even had twenty-two people piled together, resulting in a great waste of manpower. After I discovered these situations, I discussed with the team leaders and divided the temporary work groups, and the efficiency was greatly improved.
    The second was that some cooperative members were greedy for more and faster work, regardless of quality. In the fourth group of the first team, I found that when Lu Jinhai was plowing the field, he plowed one row of rice stubble, but covered another row of rice stubble with mud. I called the members of their group to come and see, and criticized Lu Jinhai, letting him know that doing so would cause losses in production.
    The third was that the scoring and work recording were unreasonable. Some teams (such as the second team) had weaker cadres, and no one spoke up when scoring, and later they simply stopped scoring, and the cooperative members' work enthusiasm was very low. So I told the team leader how to find standard labor in the group and compare each other to score the work.
    In addition, problems such as incomplete attendance were also discovered.
    I feel that this field inspection is a good way for a director of a large cooperative to understand the situation and discover problems. Going to each farming area every day and meeting with each team leader in the field is much better than listening to reports in meetings at night. Some problems can be solved in a timely manner, and the cadres will not be overly tired. Moreover, going to each farming area myself makes it clear at a glance the number of people attending each team, the production mood, the speed of efficiency, and the quality. Every time I discover problems during field inspections, I bring them up in the evening when I meet with the deputy director and production team leaders. The problems that have been solved should be brought to the attention of each team; the problems that have not been solved should be discussed with everyone to find solutions.
    Such field inspections should be purposeful in advance, not aimlessly wandering around. The so-called purpose refers to two things. One is to have a clear idea of what to focus on understanding at what time. For example, when approaching rice transplanting, I focused on grasping the transplanting plan of each team and each group (when to start transplanting, where to transplant first and where to transplant later, whether the manpower is enough, etc.). After the transplanting started, I focused on seeing whether the division of labor and task arrangement of each team were appropriate. After that, I focused on how to do a good job in piece-rate work during transplanting. Second, you should also have a clear idea of when you should focus on going to which farming area. I usually go to the production teams with more difficulties and more problems to understand the situation and help them solve problems in a timely manner.

    Frequently Grasp Numbers
    To arrange the production of a large cooperative of more than one hundred households, it is not enough to rely on feelings and do whatever comes to mind. It is necessary to grasp the numbers. For example, how many people attend work every day? How much work has been done? What is the efficiency? What is the progress of production? Frequently grasping these numbers can reveal many problems.
    When the spring plowing preparation work started this spring, we didn't understand this point and suffered. At that time, I didn't even know the exact number of households, population, and labor force in the entire cooperative, let alone how many people went to work every day.
    Later, we compiled the statistics of households, population, and labor force of each production team; every night, we counted the number of people attending work in each team, and checked the reasons for those with low attendance. In this way, we gradually paid attention to grasping the numbers, and solved many problems from grasping the numbers. For example, mud grinding was initially very inefficient. Later, we conducted statistics separately every day and found that the mud grinding boat responsible by Wu Lianshen's group could grind 480 boats a day, while other boats could only grind 300 boats. Why was there such a big difference? It turned out that the other mud grinding boats were late for work every day and early for finishing work, and the people were not matched well and did not get along well. After we discovered these situations, we immediately introduced Wu Lianshen's group's practices to everyone, and improved the work efficiency of each grinding boat.

    Help Cadres Learn to Do Leadership Work
    To lead a large cooperative well, of course, you cannot rely on the strength of one person alone, but rely on all the cadres of the cooperative to jointly take on the responsibility.
    In the initial period of production, because everyone lacked experience, the work was often not done well. For example, Deputy Director Liang Qi'an, when the work was assigned, it was decided that he would be solely responsible for leading the mud-supporting work, but he did not understand how to lead. Once, some cooperative members did not go to work, and he did not study the reasons, but personally replaced the mud-supporting workers, and as a result, the work was not done well.
    When encountering these situations, I tell everyone my leadership experience. I said to Liang Qi'an: Your hard work alone is not as good as mobilizing all the cooperative members to lend a hand; cadres cannot rely on just one energy, but should think of more ways. Usually, when I meet with the members of the cooperative affairs committee and the team leaders, I first ask them: "What problems should we focus on grasping these days?" Or: "What do you say, what should a storage committee member do?" In this way, we encourage everyone to use their brains more and think of more ways.
    Cultivating cadres is not only to improve their work ability, but more importantly, to help them improve their thinking. Some cadres do not yet understand the meaning of their work, and they will be emotionally low when encountering difficulties, so we must encourage them well. For example, the fifth team is more difficult to lead, and the team leader has lost confidence and does not want to be the team leader. I said to him: The rice bowl of dozens of households is on your shoulders, and many farmers outside the cooperative are watching our cooperative, how can you give up halfway? Then, I studied the leadership methods with him and strengthened his confidence in his work.
    After nearly a year of work and improved leadership methods, the work of our cooperative is now much more planned and orderly than before.

    我是怎样学会当大社主任的
    梁祥胜
    摆脱事务主义
    我是广东省中山县群众乡第一农业生产合作社社主任。一九五四年秋季，我们社一下子由十六户扩大到一百三十多户，我过去领导小社的经验就不够用了。
    这个大社刚投入生产的时候，工作可忙乱透啦，每天不管白天黑夜，总是一大班人围着我，简直把我搞得头昏眼花。
    当时，我对自己的职责还不大明确，见一件就去做一件，甚至社员出工不齐，我也亲自逐户去找。做的多，想的少。自己忙得昏昏沉沉，辛辛苦苦，可是工作没有计划，越忙越乱。
    于是我就想：究竟当社主任应该负担什么工作？要首先抓住哪一环？
    过去一年当社主任的经验告诉我：必须首先抓住社的生产工作，使社能够有条理地进行生产，也就是说要抓好生产计划和劳动力的组织。于是，我就集中力量抓住这些主要问题，把其他各种事情交给其他干部分工负责。例如银钱收支交给会计、出纳去管；买艇、租艇由副主任负责搞；平日给每个社员派工等工作，也是预先跟队长、组长大体商量好，由他们去干。使自己从许多日常事务里摆脱出来。
    不能单靠自己带头生产
    我虽然认识到自己的首要职责是搞好生产，可是，怎样深入领导生产，这还是一个大问题。领导十六户小社的时候，我是亲自参加生产，以自己的带头作用来领导的。那时，我一边生产，一边就考虑了全社的工作安排。最多也不过是早一点收工，到各块田巡一巡。这样，生产上有什么问题，下一段应该做什么，人力怎样安排，也就心中有数了。我从这点经验出发，就以为只要自己亲自参加生产，事事带头，就能领导好生产。扩社以后的初期，我亲自参加了第一生产队第一组的生产，每天早些起床，叫社员出工。可是，这样带头，并不能带动全社一百多户三百多个社员。相反，埋头在一个生产小组干活的结果，却使自己对全社的情况一点都不了解。这样，就没办法有计划地安排工作。
    这时，我开始体会到：深入田间生产应该是为了掌握情况、发现问题、领导生产，而不是单纯为了起带头作用。为了达到这个目的，我就改变了在一个生产小组里埋头生产的方法，而采用“巡田”的工作方法。每天到各个耕作区巡一巡，看看各个队社员的生产情绪，找队长、社员谈谈话，了解情况。
    有目的地深入田间
    巡田的头几天，我发现了许多问题。
    第一是有不少队长、组长缺乏调拨指挥劳动力的办法，不懂得按工作需要划分临时作业小组。例如锹河泥，本来只要七个人就能干得很好。可是，有些队却把十四个人弄在一块传泥，第二队第二组甚至二十二个人都堆在一块，造成了很大的窝工浪费。我发现了这些情况，就找队长商量，划分了临时作业小组，效率提高了许多。
    第二是有些社员工作贪多图快，不顾质量。在第一队第四组，我发现卢金海翻田的时候，翻了一行稻茬，却用泥盖住了另一行稻茬。我叫他们小组的社员来看，并且批评了卢金海，让他知道这样做会使生产受到损失。
    第三是评分记工不合理。有些队（如第二队）干部较弱，评起分来没人发言，后来索性不评了，社员劳动情绪很低。于是我就告诉队长，应该怎样在组内找标准劳动力，互相比较评成数。
    此外，还发现了出勤不齐等等问题。
    我觉得，这样巡田是当一个大社主任了解情况和发现问题的好方法。每天到各个耕作区跑一趟，同各个队长在田头碰碰头，比之晚上开会听汇报好得多，有些问题能及时解决，干部也不致过分疲劳。而且自己亲自到各个耕作区跑一趟，各个队的出勤人数，生产情绪，效率快慢，质量好坏，全都一目了然。每次巡田发现的问题，我就在晚上同副主任和生产队长碰头的时候提出来，已经解决了的，要各队都引起注意；没有解决的，就同大家研究解决的办法。
    这样巡田应该事先有目的，不是心中无数地到处逛。所谓有目的，是指两件事。一是什么时候着重了解什么东西，要心中有数。例如临近插秧的时候，我就着重抓各队各组的插秧计划（什么时候开始插，先插哪里后插哪里，人力是否赶得及等）。插秧开始以后，就着重看各队人力分工、排工是否适当。其后，就着重抓插秧当中怎样搞好按件记工。二是什么时候应该着重到那个耕作区，也要心中有数。我平时是专门到困难多、问题多的生产队了解情况，及时帮助他们解决问题。
    经常掌握数字
    要把一个一百多户的大社的生产安排好，单靠感想，想到什么干什么，是不成的。必须要掌握数字。例如，每天出勤人数多少？干了多少活？效率如何？生产进度怎样？能够经常掌握这些数字，就能发现很多问题。
    今春备耕工作开始的时候，我们还不懂得这一点，曾经吃过苦头。那时，我连全社户口、人口、劳动力的确实数字都不知道，每天有多少人出工更加不知道。
    后来，我们把各生产队的户口、人口、劳动力统计好；每天晚上，统计一下各队出勤人数，出勤少的就查查是什么原因。这样，我们逐渐注意了掌握数字，从掌握数字中解决了很多问题。例如绞泥，起先效率很低，后来每天分别进行统计，就发现吴连深小组负责的那只绞泥艇一天能绞四百八十多艇，别的艇只能绞三百艇。为什么会相差这么大呢？原来其他的绞泥艇每天迟出工，早收工，人又没有搭配好，不大合得来。发现了这些情况，我们就立即向大家介绍吴连深小组的做法，提高了各绞艇的工作效率。
    帮助干部学会做领导工作
    要领导好大社，当然不能单靠自己一个人的力量，要靠全社干部共同把责任担当起来。
    在初投入生产的时期，由于大家都缺乏经验，工作往往搞不好。例如副主任梁齐安，本来分工的时候决定由他专责领导撑泥工作，可是他不懂得应该怎样领导。一次，有些社员不出工，他也不去研究是什么原因，却自己亲自去顶替撑泥的，结果工作也没搞好。
    碰到这些情况，我就把自己的领导经验告诉大家。我对梁齐安说：你一个人拼命干，比不上发动全体社员动一动手；当干部的不能单靠一股劲，要多想办法。平时，我同各个社务委员、队长碰头的时候，都首先问他们：“这几天应该抓紧什么问题？”或者是：“你说，当保管委员要干些什么？”这样来启发大家多动脑筋，多想办法。
    培养干部，不仅仅要提高他的工作能力，更重要的是要帮助他提高思想。有些干部还不懂得自己工作的意义，碰到困难的时候会情绪低落，这就要好好鼓励他们。例如，第五队比较难领导，队长就失去信心，不想当队长。我对他说：几十户人的米缸放在你的肩头上面，社外许多农民都看着我们这个社，你怎么能中途撒手不管？接着，又跟他一起研究领导方法，坚定他的工作信心。
    经过近一年来的工作，改进了领导方法，现在，我们社的工作已经比较以前有计划、有秩序得多了。
