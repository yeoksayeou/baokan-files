　　People have not forgotten how the United States vehemently denied the US Air Force personnel, such as Colonel Schwable, confessed that the United States conducted bacteriological warfare in Korea. Now, US Secretary of the Army Bruck has ordered the expansion and reorganization of the Chemical Corps, and ordered the Chemical Corps to create "all new types of bacteriological and chemical weapons that human intelligence can invent."

　　At the same time as Bruck issued this order, the US Army is holding a large-scale military exercise including "practicing chemical and bacteriological warfare." According to the Associated Press, the bacteriological warfare methods used by the United States in Korea will be used in this exercise.

　　Although the US bacteriological warfare in Korea failed, the Pentagon is still actively engaged in preparations in this area. The American "Nation" magazine recently reported that the planner of the US bacteriological warfare—Major General Creasy, chief of the Research and Development Division of the Army Chemical Corps—is "dreaming" of replacing atomic warfare with bacteriological warfare. He believes that bacteriological warfare, which "destroys life but preserves wealth," is better than nuclear weapons, which "destroys life and wealth." This fully reveals the true nature of a robber who kills and steals.

　　According to "Nation" magazine, Creasy often talks about the benefits of bacteriological warfare "with friendly chemical and pharmaceutical industries." Not long ago, he publicized that preparing for bacteriological warfare is not too difficult, because "bacteriological warfare is nothing more than reversing public health and epidemic prevention measures." This sounds like insane ramblings, but the fact is that this responsible US military officer publicly published it in Pennsylvania newspapers. He also said that germ weapons are most suitable for launching secret aggressive attacks, because it is difficult for the other party to determine "whether the onset of disease in people, animals, and plants is due to natural or man-made causes."

　　From the report of the "Nation" magazine, it can be seen that the US war planners regard China as the target of bacteriological warfare. The magazine said that the Pentagon believes that China is a "potential plague cave." The Washington plague generals are so feverish that they are planning to use spreading germs to make "most people in other countries sick and die" and to "starve others" by destroying crops.

　　Of course, the Chinese people do not think that the crazy plans of these American plague generals are just talk. However, people may wish to remind these hot-headed people who are making wishful calculations: you had better not forget the shameful failure of the bacteriological warfare against China during the Korean War.

### 美国瘟疫将军们的打算

    美国瘟疫将军们的打算
    人们还没有忘记，当许威布尔上校等美国空军人员供认美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的时候，美国曾经怎样矢口抵赖。而现在，美国陆军部长布鲁克居然下令扩大和改组化学兵团，并且命令化学兵团创造“人类智慧所能发明的一切新型细菌武器和化学武器”。
    在布鲁克发布这个命令的同时，美国陆军正在举行一次包括“演习化学和细菌战”的大规模军事演习。根据美联社的报道，在这次细菌战演习中将要使用美国在朝鲜曾经使用过的方法。
    虽然美国在朝鲜进行的细菌战是失败了，但是五角大楼却仍然在积极从事这方面的准备。美国“民族”周刊不久前报道说，美国细菌战的策划者——陆军部化学兵团研究与发展处处长克利西少将正在“梦想”用细菌战来代替原子战。他认为“能摧毁生命而保全财富”的细菌战，要比“摧毁生命和财富”的核子武器好。这十足地显出杀人越货的强盗本色。
    据“民族”周刊说，克利西经常“同友好的化学工业和制药工业”谈细菌战的好处。不久以前，他宣传说，准备细菌战是并不太费力的事，因为“细菌战不过是把公共卫生和防疫措施颠倒过来而已”。这听起来像是疯人的胡言乱语，事实却是这位负责的美国军事官员公开发表在宾夕伐尼亚的报刊上。他还说，细菌武器最宜于发动秘密的侵略进攻，因为对方要判定“人、动物、植物的发病究竟是出于自然原因还是人为的”是很困难的。
    从“民族”周刊的报道中可以看出，美国的战争策划人把中国当作进行细菌战的对象。这家杂志说，五角大楼的人认为，中国是一个“潜在的瘟疫洞”。华盛顿的瘟疫将军发瘟到了这种程度，他们竟盘算着用散播病菌来使其他国家“大部分人民患病和死亡”并用毁坏农作物的办法来“使其他人挨饿”。
    当然，中国人民并不认为这些美国瘟疫将军们的疯狂策划只是说说而已。但是，人们不妨对这些作着如意盘算的热昏者提醒一下：你们最好不要忘记朝鲜战争期间对中国进行的细菌战的可耻失败。
