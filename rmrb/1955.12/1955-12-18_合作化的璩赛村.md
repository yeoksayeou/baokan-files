The Cooperativization of Qusai Village

In the Taihang Mountains, in Lucheng County, Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, there is a village of about three hundred households - Qusai Village.

After the liberation of Qusai Village in 1945, the peasants, under the leadership of the Communist Party, gradually developed mutual aid and cooperation, embarking on the socialist road. The Civilization Agricultural Production Cooperative, established in 1952, had grown to 292 households by the winter of 1954; 98 percent of the village's farmers had joined the cooperative.

In recent years, due to the development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation in Qusai Village, agricultural production has increased, farmers' incomes have increased, and their lives have improved. Qusai Village, which used to "rely on other places for grain," can now sell large quantities of surplus grain to the state to support national construction.

In the high tide of the great development of agricultural cooperativization nationwide, the members of the Civilization Agricultural Production Cooperative studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" and the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, actively carried out overall planning, consolidated and improved the organization of the cooperative, and strived to transition to a completely socialist agricultural production cooperative in 1956.

The cadres of the Civilization Agricultural Production Cooperative are observing the terrain on Xiaoyang Mountain, east of Qusai Village, in preparation for overall planning.

Qusai Village has made an overall plan for eliminating illiteracy. By 1957, young illiterate people will be eliminated, and by 1958, adult illiterate people can be eliminated. The Qusai Village People's School has started normal classes since mid-November, and young women are actively participating in learning.

The Civilization Agricultural Production Cooperative actively responded to the call of "overall planning, strengthening leadership," and the cooperative affairs committee decided to gradually implement overall planning and strive to transition to a completely socialist agricultural cooperative in 1956.

In the great development of agricultural cooperativization, the Communist Party and Communist Youth League organizations in Qusai Village have become more consolidated and developed. This is the scene of the Party branch organization member providing knowledge education about the Party to new Party members.

Qusai Village has a complete primary school with 216 students. According to the overall plan, the number of students in the whole school will increase to 296 by 1957. This is the students doing children's calisthenics.

The 26 young shock team members of the Eighth Production Team planted more than 16,400 fruit trees on Xiaoyang Mountain this year. In a few years, this will become a fruit tree forest. Now they are doing the winter protection of seedlings.

Cooperative member Zhang Youfa decided to feed his horse well and strive for greater bumper harvests for the agricultural cooperative.

In recent years, the Civilization Agricultural Production Cooperative has also seen rapid development in forestry and animal husbandry. The agricultural cooperative now has 300 sheep and plans to increase them to 500 in three years.

After joining the Civilization Agricultural Production Cooperative, poor peasant Guo Wenxin's income increased. This year, in addition to paying public grain and selling more than 1,000 catties of surplus grain to the state, his family still has more than 2,300 catties of grain, and the whole family lives well.

Encouraged by the slogan of striving to transition to advanced forms of agricultural cooperatives as soon as possible, the cooperative members actively carried out autumn plowing work to ensure a greater bumper harvest next year.

The Civilization Agricultural Production Cooperative has six busy farming childcare groups during the busy farming season. This is a small baby in the childcare group.

The fact that the Civilization Agricultural Production Cooperative has increased production year after year has educated the peasants in nearby villages; the peasants are determined to take the road of cooperativization. This is the scene of the peasants who newly joined the cooperative in Dayu Village visiting the threshing ground of the Civilization Agricultural Production Cooperative. Gou Faxing (second from the right), the director of the Civilization Cooperative, is introducing them to the experience of high corn production.

    合作化的璩赛村
    在太行山上，在山西省长治专区潞安县，有一个三百来户人家的村庄——璩寨村。
    一九四五年璩寨村解放后，农民们就在共产党的领导下逐步发展互助合作，走上了社会主义的道路。一九五二年建立起来的文明农业生产合作社，到一九五四年冬已发展到二百九十二户；全村百分之九十八的农户都入社了。
    几年来，璩寨村由于农业生产互助合作的发展，农业生产量提高了，农民们的收入增加了，生活也改善了。过去“吃粮靠外地”的璩寨村，现在可以把大批余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设了。
    在全国农业合作化大发展的高潮中，文明农业生产合作社的社员们学习了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会“关于农业合作化问题的决议”，积极进行全面规划，巩固和提高社的组织，争取在一九五六年过渡到完全社会主义的农业生产合作社。

    文明农业生产合作社的干部们在璩寨村东小羊山上观察地形，准备进行全面规划。
    璩寨村对扫除文盲工作进行了全面规划，到一九五七年将要扫除青年文盲，到一九五八年可以扫除壮年文盲。璩寨村民校已从十一月中旬起开始正常上课，青年妇女们都积极参加了学习。
    文明农业生产合作社积极响应“全面规划，加强领导”的号召，社务委员会会议决定逐步实行全面规划，争取在一九五六年内过渡到完全社会主义的农业社。
    在农业合作化大发展中，璩寨村共产党、青年团的组织更加巩固和发展了。这是党支部组织委员在向新党员进行觉的知识教育时的情形。
    璩寨村有一所完全小学，现有学生二百十六人。根据全面规划：到一九五七年全校学生将增加到二百九十六人。这是学生们在做少年儿童广播体操。
    第八生产队的二十六个青年突击队员，今年在小羊山上种植了一万六千四百多株菓树。几年以后，这里将成为一片菓树林。现在他们正在做冬季保护幼苗的工作。
    社员张有法决定把自己的马喂得好好的，为农业社争取更大的丰产。
    文明农业生产合作社近年来在林业和牧畜业方面也有了很快的发展，农业社现在有三百只羊，计划三年后要发展到五百只。
    贫农郭文新加入了文明农业生产合作社以后，收入增加了。今年除缴纳公粮和卖给国家余粮共一千多斤外，家里还有粮食二千三百多斤，全家生活过得很好。
    社员们在争取早日过渡到高级形式农业社的口号的鼓舞下，积极进行秋耕工作，保证明年更大丰产。
    文明农业生产合作社在农忙的时候设有六个农忙托儿组。这是在托儿组内的一个小娃娃。
    文明农业生产合作社年年增产的事实教育了附近各村的农民；农民们都决心走合作化的道路。这是大裕村今年新入社的农民参观文明农业生产合作社打谷场的情形，文明社社长苟发兴（右起第二人）正给他们介绍玉米丰产的经验。
    社员们在村供销社里选购自己喜爱的衣料。
