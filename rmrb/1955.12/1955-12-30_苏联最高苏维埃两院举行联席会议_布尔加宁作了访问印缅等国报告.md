Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 29th: TASS reports that the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities held a joint session on December 29th in the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow.

At the meeting, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, delivered a report on his and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev's, visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan.

In the opening section of his report, Bulganin pointed out that the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was being held at the end of 1955, a year in which significant international events occurred that brought about major changes in international relations and a certain shift in international tensions. The role played by Asian countries, accounting for more than half of the world's population, is becoming increasingly important in modern international life. The development of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, and Afghanistan is undoubtedly a great contribution to consolidating peace.

Bulganin said that the strengthening and development of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, and Afghanistan, as well as the further rapprochement between the Soviet people and the great people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan, are the direct results of our visit to these countries. However, the significance of this visit is not limited to this.

The major international significance of this visit lies primarily in the fact that the correctness of the basic Leninist principle upon which Soviet foreign policy is based—the principle of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social-political systems—has been confirmed time and again. This visit clearly and convincingly demonstrated that this principle is a reliable foundation for strengthening peace and the security of all nations, and for developing international trust.

The deputies and guests attending the joint session of the two houses listened attentively to Bulganin's report on the visit of the Soviet government delegation to India, Burma, and Afghanistan. His report was punctuated by applause.

After Bulganin finished his report, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, spoke. He began by saying that he fully agreed with Bulganin's report. He pointed out that the Soviet government delegation accepted with great satisfaction the invitation from the governments of India, Burma, and Afghanistan to visit these countries.

Khrushchev then spoke in detail about the principles of equality and sovereignty, which serve as the basis for the Soviet Union's relations with other countries.

    苏联最高苏维埃两院举行联席会议
    布尔加宁作了访问印缅等国报告
    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院，十二月二十九日在莫斯科大克里姆林宫举行联席会议。
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在会上作了关于他和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的报告。
    布尔加宁在报告的开头部分指出，苏联最高苏维埃会议是在一九五五年年底举行的，在这一年中发生了使国际关系有重大变动、使国际紧张局势有一定转折的巨大国际事件。占全世界人口一半以上的亚洲国家在现代国际生活中所起的作用越来越大。苏联同印度、缅甸、阿富汗之间的友谊和合作的发展，毫无疑问，对巩固和平是一个巨大的贡献。
    布尔加宁说，苏联同印度、缅甸、阿富汗之间的友谊和合作的加强和发展，以及苏联人民同伟大的印度人民、缅甸人民和阿富汗人民的进一步接近，是我们访问这些国家的直接结果。但是，这次访问的意义还不限于此。
    这次访问的重大国际意义首先在于：苏联外交政策所依据的列宁的基本原则——有着不同社会—政治制度的国家和平共处的原则的正确性，一次又一次地得到了证实。这次访问清楚地和令人信服地表明了，这一原则对加强和平和各国人民的安全，对发展国际的信任是一个可靠的基础。
    出席两院联席会议的代表们和来宾们倾听了布尔加宁关于苏联政府代表团访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的报告。他的报告不时被掌声所打断。
    在布尔加宁作完报告以后，苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫发言。他首先说，他完全同意布尔加宁的报告。他指出，苏联政府代表团以极其满意的心情接受了印度、缅甸和阿富汗政府约它去访问这些国家的邀请。
    赫鲁晓夫接着详细地谈到了作为苏联同其他国家的关系的基础的平等和主权的原则。
