Good News of Early Completion of Production Plans

    Soviet Union
    Many enterprises under the Soviet Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy have completed their Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) production tasks ahead of schedule due to vigorously launching socialist competitions. In the competition, steelworkers in various enterprises actively studied and introduced to each other the most effective production methods and experiences in improving various technologies. This ensured the improvement of production and labor productivity. For example, blast furnace workers in Siberia enthusiastically introduced a new method of preparing carbonaceous mud to workers at the "Azov Steel Plant" in Ukraine. This carbonaceous mud can close the iron tapping hole of the blast furnace throughout the ironmaking process without weakening the blast. As a result, the amount of molten iron increased by more than 5 percent, the durability of the blast furnace taphole increased by about two times, and the labor of workers was reduced.
    In addition to technical bulletins, radio exchanges, and private correspondence between factories, the exchange of advanced production experience between enterprises also takes the form of factory joint schools that organize research, integrate, and apply advanced experience. For example, this year, thirty factory joint schools have been held between the Magnitogorsk factory and the Kuznetsk Integrated Iron and Steel Works, between the Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Factory and the Makayevka Steel Factory, and among the staff of many scientific research institutes. Some of these schools studied and integrated the advanced experience of using blooming mills and heating furnaces and applied them to their own enterprises.
    North Korea
    Major sectors of North Korea's heavy industry have completed this year's production plans ahead of schedule.
    The metal industry sector of North Korea completed the annual total output value plan on December 10, ahead of schedule. The annual output value of the metal industry this year will reach the pre-war level. Important factories in the metal industry, such as the Kim Chaek Ironworks and the Seongjin Steel Mill, have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. The pig iron produced by the Kim Chaek Ironworks can already meet domestic needs.
    North Korea's machinery industry sector completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule at the end of November this year. The total output value of the machinery industry this year increased by 74 percent compared to last year.
    As of now, eight coal mines, including Gugeonwon, Sariwon, and Hyesan, have completed this year's production plans.
    Poland
    Poland's machine manufacturing industry has completed its 1955 production tasks. Many enterprises in this industrial sector will overproduce a large number of various products by the end of the year, including trucks and tractors.
    The chemical industry completed this year's production tasks seventeen days ahead of schedule. The plan to reduce production costs was also overfulfilled. This year, the total output value of the chemical industry will increase by about 17 percent compared to last year.
    In the coal mining industry, the Dombrova United Coal Mine and the Jaworzno-Mikołów United Coal Mine both completed their annual plans twelve days ahead of schedule. The Dombrova United Coal Mine will overproduce 340,000 tons of coal before the end of the year.
    German Democratic Republic
    Many industrial sectors and factories in the German Democratic Republic have completed the first Five-Year Plan and this year's production plans ahead of schedule.
    The Stalin Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Factory, the largest electrical equipment manufacturing factory in the Democratic District of Berlin, completed the tasks stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan up to the end of 1955 on December 17.
    Workers in all cement manufacturing factories in the German Democratic Republic completed this year's production quotas ahead of schedule on December 17. Before the end of this year, they will overproduce 100,000 tons of cement. The steelworkers of the Hennigsdorf Steel Plant, who completed this year's annual production plan ahead of schedule, will overproduce 10,000 tons of steel before the end of the year.
    Czechoslovakia
    Many factories and mining enterprises in Czechoslovakia have completed the 1955 production plans ahead of schedule.
    In the steel industry, the three largest national steel conglomerates, "Molotov," "New Gottwald," and "Gottwald," as well as some other steel factories, have completed or overfulfilled their annual output plans and saved a large amount of funds.
    In the coal mining industry, the first coal mining enterprise in the country to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule was the Komorany Open-Pit Coal Mine Trust. The most advanced mine of this trust, the Swierma Coal Mine, gloriously won the Republic President's Award Flag, the Soviet Miners' Pennant, and the Chinese Miners' Pennant.
    Hungary
    Many enterprises in Hungary's metallurgy, machine manufacturing, chemical, mining, and other important industrial sectors have completed their 1955 production plans ahead of schedule.
    More than seventy enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgy and Machine Manufacturing have completed their annual product production plans ahead of schedule. Various metallurgical factories overproduced 20,000 tons of steel.
    Thirty coal mines and mines, and twenty-six chemical industrial enterprises, have also completed the 1955 production plan ahead of schedule.
    Bulgaria
    Bulgaria's machine manufacturing industry completed this year's production plan sixteen days ahead of schedule.
    This year, Bulgaria's machine manufacturing industry has supplied agriculture with more than 12,000 agricultural machines and supplied the mining industry and other industrial sectors with many machines and equipment. Various machine factories have mastered the production of many new products, including sugar beet harvesting combines, corn harvesting combines, and high-efficiency metal cutting lathes.
    Romania
    Romania's food industry has completed the production tasks for the last year of the Five-Year Plan—1955—ahead of schedule. The total output of the food industry this year is 10 percent more than in 1954.
    This year, the food supplied by Romania's food industry to residents has greatly increased compared to 1950, before the start of the Five-Year Plan, with bread increasing by 65 percent, sugar by 42 percent, edible oil by 130 percent, butter by 181 percent, and meat products by 168 percent.

    提前完成生产计划的捷报
    苏联
    苏联钢铁工业部的许多企业由于大力展开社会主义竞赛，已经提前完成了五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）的生产任务。在竞赛当中，各企业的钢铁工人都积极地学习和互相介绍最有效的生产方法和改进各种技术的经验。这就保证了生产和劳动生产率的提高。例如，西伯利亚的高炉工人热情地把配制炭质泥料的新方法介绍给乌克兰“亚速钢铁工厂”的工人。这种炭质泥料能够在整个炼铁的过程中关闭高炉的出铁口，而不减弱鼓风。结果，生铁的熔铸量增加了百分之五多，高炉的出铁口的耐久性也增加了约两倍，而工人的劳动却减轻了。
    各企业的先进生产经验的交流，除了通过各厂之间的技术通报、无线电交流情况和私人通信等办法以外，还采取了组织研究、综合和运用先进经验的叫做工厂联合学校的方法。例如，今年马格尼托哥尔斯克工厂和库兹涅茨克联合钢铁厂之间，新塔吉尔冶金工厂和马卡耶夫卡钢铁工厂之间，以及许多科学研究所的工作人员之间已经举办了三十个工厂联合学校。其中一些学校研究和综合了使用初轧机和加热炉的先进经验，并且把它们应用到自己的企业中去。
    朝鲜
    朝鲜重工业中的主要部门已经提前完成了今年的生产计划。
    朝鲜金属工业部门在十二月十日提前完成了全年的总产值计划。金属工业今年全年的产值将可达到战前的水平。金属工业中的重要工厂金策制铁所和城津炼钢厂等都已经提前完成了全年的生产计划。金策制铁所生产的生铁已能满足国内的需要。
    朝鲜机械工业部门在今年十一月底就提前完成了全年的生产计划。机械工业今年的总产值比去年增加了百分之七十四。
    煤炭工业部门到目前已有古乾原、沙里院、惠山等八个煤矿完成了今年的生产计划。
    波兰
    波兰机器制造工业已经完成了一九五五年的生产任务。这个工业部门的许多企业到年底将超计划生产大量的各种产品，其中包括卡车和拖拉机等。
    化学工业提前十七天完成了今年的生产任务。降低生产成本的计划也超额完成了。今年，化学工业总产值将比去年增加百分之十七左右。
    在煤矿工业方面，冬布罗瓦联合矿场和雅沃日诺—米科沃夫联合矿场都提前十二天完成了年度计划。冬布罗瓦联合矿场在年底以前将超计划生产三十四万吨煤。
    德意志民主共和国
    德意志民主共和国的许多产业部门和工厂已经提前完成了第一个五年计划和本年度的生产计划。
    柏林民主区最大的电气装备制造工厂斯大林电气装备制造工厂已经在十二月十七日完成了到一九五五年年底为止的第一个五年计划所规定的任务。
    德意志民主共和国所有的水泥制造工厂的工人都在十二月十七日提前完成了本年度的生产定额。在今年年底以前，他们还要超额生产十万吨水泥。提前完成了今年年度生产计划的赫宁斯多夫钢铁厂的炼钢工人将在年底以前超额生产一万吨钢。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    捷克斯洛伐克有许多厂矿企业提前完成了一九五五年的生产计划。
    在钢铁工业中，“莫洛托夫”、“新哥特瓦尔德”、“哥特瓦尔德”等三个全国最大的钢铁联合企业和其他一些钢铁工厂，都已经完成或者超额完成了全年的产量计划，并且节约了大量的资金。
    在煤矿工业中，全国第一个提前完成全年计划的煤矿企业是科莫兰尼露天煤矿托辣斯。这个托辣斯的最先进的矿场——斯维尔马煤矿场光荣地获得了共和国总统奖旗、苏联矿工锦旗和中国矿工锦旗。
      匈牙利
    匈牙利的冶金、机器制造、化学、采矿和其他重要的工业部门已经有许多企业提前完成了一九五五年的生产计划。
    冶金和机器制造工业部有七十多个企业，提前完成了全年产品生产计划。各冶金工厂超计划生产了两万吨钢材。
    提前完成一九五五年生产计划的还有三十个煤矿和矿山，二十六个化学工业企业。
    保加利亚
    保加利亚机器制造业提前十六天完成了今年的生产计划。
    今年，保加利亚机器制造业已经供给农业一万二千多台农业机器，供给采矿工业和其他工业部门许多机器设备。各机器工厂掌握了许多新的产品的生产，其中包括甜菜收获联合机、玉蜀黍收获联合机、生产效率高的金属切削车床等。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚食品工业已经提前完成了五年计划最后一年——一九五五年的生产任务。今年食品工业的总产量比一九五四年多百分之十。
    今年罗马尼亚食品工业供给居民的食品比五年计划开始前的一九五零年大大增加了，其中面包增加了百分之六十五，糖增加百分之四十二，食油增加百分之一百三十，奶油增加百分之一百八十一，肉产品增加百分之一百六十八。（据新华社讯）
