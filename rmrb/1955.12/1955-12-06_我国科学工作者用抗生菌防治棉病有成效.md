Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. Our country's first experiment in using antibiotic bacteria to prevent diseases and increase production in cotton has achieved preliminary results. This experiment has been conducted for three years by the Cotton Disease Group of the Institute of Microbiology, Department of Plant Pathology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Department of Plant Protection of Beijing Agricultural University, and the Northeast Liaoyang Cotton Experiment Farm.

Scientists selected effective antibiotic bacterial strains from various cotton-growing areas and mixed them with cottonseed cake, fertile soil, and other materials to create "antibiotic bacterial cake soil." In the Northeast Liaoyang Cotton Experiment Farm, where Verticillium wilt is severe, the two-year trial results of using this "antibiotic bacterial cake soil" have proven that antibiotic bacteria can inhibit the occurrence of cotton Verticillium wilt and reduce its damage, and can increase pre-frost yield. The farm of Beijing Agricultural University used "antibiotic bacterial cake soil" to coat seeds or sprinkled it between rows during sowing, proving that it can also reduce the occurrence of seedling diseases such as damping-off, anthracnose, and blight in the cotton seedling stage, and increase cotton yield.

To utilize antibiotic bacteria to prevent cotton diseases, scientists collected soil samples from sixteen cotton-growing areas in Northeast, North, and Northwest China, and identified more than 2,000 "actinomycete strains," from which they selected more than ten "actinomycete strains" that are effective against various cotton pathogens.

Scientists have also studied simple methods for farmers to propagate antibiotic bacteria themselves, to promote them in rural areas. They have conducted a series of studies on temperature, humidity, cake-soil ratio, ventilation, and soil quality. Finally, they have preliminarily identified various conditions conducive to the growth of antibiotic bacteria, which can be well propagated in non-disinfected cake soil. In the future, scientists plan to further expand this research.

    我国科学工作者用抗生菌防治棉病有成效
    新华社五日讯　我国第一次在棉花上用抗生菌来进行防病和增产的试验工作已经获得初步的效果。这项试验工作是由中国科学院植物研究所真菌植物病理研究室棉花病害组、北京农业大学植物保护系和东北辽阳棉作试验场共同进行的，他们已经研究了三年。
    科学工作者从各棉区中选择有效的抗生菌种同棉籽饼、肥土等混合制成“抗生菌饼土”。在发生黄萎病较严重的东北辽阳棉作试验场内，试用这种“抗生菌饼土”两年的结果证明：抗生菌可抑制棉花黄萎病的发生和减轻它的受害的程度，可使霜前产量增加。北京农业大学的农场把“抗生菌饼土”拌种或在播种的时候撒入行间，证明也可减少棉花苗期的立枯、炭疽、猝倒等病的发生，和提高棉花的产量。
    科学工作者们为了利用抗生菌防治棉病，曾到东北、华北、西北等十六个棉区搜集土壤样品，从中找出二千多个“放线菌系”，经过效果的测定，共选择出十多个兼抗棉花各种病菌的“放线菌系”。
    科学工作者还研究了农民自己可以繁殖抗生菌的简便方法，以便在农村中推行。他们曾进行了温度、湿度、饼土比量、通气情况和土质等一系列的研究。最后，初步找出有利于抗生菌生长的各种条件可在不经消毒的饼土中很好地繁殖抗生菌。今后，科学工作者还准备进一步展开这项研究工作。
