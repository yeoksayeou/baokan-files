Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, December 13th (TASS)—Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers N.A. Bulganin and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR N.S. Khrushchev met on December 13th with Indian parliamentarians belonging to the Hindi Development Association. This association was organized in 1952 to promote Hindi. According to the constitution, Hindi is the national language of India. Almost all ministers of the Indian government are members of this association.

The chairman of the association, Seth Govind Das, welcomed Bulganin and Khrushchev on behalf of the association's members.

The poet Maithili Sharan Gupt recited a poem welcoming the Soviet guests.

Then, N.S. Khrushchev spoke.

Khrushchev said: Direct exchanges are necessary for better mutual understanding and for the fuller development of economic and cultural relations between our two countries, and using a third language as a means of contact between our two great peoples will be difficult to maintain satisfactorily in the long run. We will endeavor to establish an educational institution in our country where outstanding and talented young people can study Hindi and other Indian languages. This will facilitate the establishment of better understanding between our two peoples and will make it possible to have more and better mutual understanding.

British and American journalists are indignant at the anti-colonial remarks made by N.A. Bulganin and myself in your country and in Burma. They have no reason to be angry. I believe that there is nothing in our anti-colonial remarks that would make some people oppose others. These remarks should be understood as words against colonial plunder and the colonial system. If some people do not like such words, that is a matter for their conscience. But we will still declare at any time and in any place that we are enemies of colonialism.

We do not want to make anyone quarrel with the United States of America and Great Britain, and we ourselves do not intend to quarrel with them. The Soviet Union hopes to get along well with these countries. But this does not mean that we must conceal the truth and only say things that please them, including the defenders of the colonial system.

We are talking about colonialism as a historical fact. I am surprised that our remarks against colonialism and against Portugal's continued colonial rule in Goa and other Portuguese territories in India have led some American politicians to defend the Portuguese colonialists on the grounds that these territories have been in their hands for about four hundred years. No matter how many years have passed, stolen goods are still stolen goods, and they must be returned to their original owners. Stolen goods should be returned, with interest. Of course, if there is a conscience.

I would like to talk about another issue. If I am not mistaken, the Republic of India has a population of 370 million. Therefore, apart from China, India is the most populous country in the world. This means that India is one of the most powerful countries in the world. India has a high level of literature and art. India is one of the oldest cradles of world civilization. The talent of the Indian people and their cultural level are reflected in the countless historical buildings that can be seen in every corner of India. Many of these buildings were built thousands of years ago. All this demonstrates the greatness of India and its people.

But until now, India has not been officially recognized as a major power in the world. The countries usually listed as major powers are the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, France, and China. Not only that, but some Western politicians also want to deprive China of its right as a major power. When they talk about China, they usually refer to the Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched in Taiwan, no matter how ridiculous this is. In this way, five countries are considered major powers. But if we study this issue objectively, a question naturally arises: why is India not considered a major power? Obviously, the reason for this is that the colonialists want to despise your country and despise your people. To recognize India as a major power would require them to change their attitude. But we believe that India is a major power and should take a first-class position in the ranks of the world's major powers.

I would also like to say a few words about the following. Some people accuse N.A. Bulganin and me of pitting East against West. This is, of course, a gross fabrication. Our country represents both Europe and Asia. We were and still are opposed to any opposition of one part of the world against another, and we are opposed to one continent dominating another.

We want all peoples to be independent and to develop according to their own wishes, and we want them to improve their economies and cultures in every way possible and to live in an atmosphere of peace and friendship.

    在会见印度国会议员发展印地语协会会员的时候
    赫鲁晓夫发表讲话
    新华社据塔斯社德里十三日电　苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫十二月十三日会见了属于国会议员发展印地语协会的印度国会议员。这个协会是一九五二年为宣传印地语而组织起来的。依照宪法，印地语是印度的国语。印度政府的部长们几乎全都是这个协会的会员。
    这个协会的主席赛特·戈文德·达斯代表协会的会员欢迎了布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。
    诗人梅特利·沙兰·古普塔朗诵了欢迎苏联贵宾的诗篇。
    然后，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫说：为了彼此有更好的了解、为了更充分地发展我们两国之间的经济和文化关系，直接的交往是必要的，而使用第三种语言作为我们两国伟大人民的接触工具将是很难长期使人满意的。我们将努力设法在我们国家内设立一个教育机构，使优秀的和有天才的青年在那里学习印地语和其他印度语言。这将便利于建立我们两国人民之间的更好的了解，并且将可能使彼此有更多和更好的认识。
    英国和美国的记者对于尼·亚·布尔加宁和我自己在你们国家和缅甸发表的反对殖民制度的言论感到愤懑。他们是没有理由发怒的。我认为，在我们的反对殖民主义的言论中并没有任何东西会使一些人反对另一些人。这些言论应该了解为反对殖民掠夺和殖民制度的话。如果有些人不喜欢这种话，那是他们的良心的问题。但是我们在任何时候和任何地方都还是要宣布我们是殖民主义的敌人。
    我们并不想使任何人同美利坚合众国和英国吵架，我们自己也不打算同它们吵架。苏联希望同这些国家友好相处。但是这并不意味着：我们一定要隐讳真理，对每一个人包括殖民制度的保卫者们在内，只说那些使他们喜欢的话。
    我们是作为一个历史事实来谈论殖民主义的。我感到惊奇的是，我们的反对殖民主义、反对葡萄牙在果阿和在印度领土上的其他葡萄牙属地继续进行殖民统治的言论，竟然使某些美国政治家出来为葡萄牙殖民主义者辩护，理由是这些属地在他们手中已经约有四百年了。不论过去多少年，贼赃仍然是贼赃，它必须归还原主。贼赃应该归还，而且还要加上利息。当然，如果是有良心的话。
    我愿意再谈一个问题。如果我不错的话，印度共和国有三亿七千万人口。因此，除了中国之外，印度是世界上人口最多的国家。这就是说，印度是世界上最强大的国家之一。印度的文学和艺术水平很高。印度是世界文明的最古老的发源地之一。印度人民的才能和他们的文化水平，反映在在印度任何角落都可以看到的无数历史建筑物上。这些建筑物有许多是在几千年以前建造的。所有这一切都说明了印度和它的人民的伟大。
    但是到现在为止，印度并没有被正式认为是世界的一个大国。通常被列为世界大国的是苏联、美国、英国、法国和中国。不仅这样，某些西方政客还想剥夺中国的作为一个大国的权利。他们在说到中国的时候，通常指的是盘踞在台湾的蒋介石集团，不管这是多么可笑的。这样，五个国家被认为是大国。但是如果客观地研究这个问题的话，很自然地要产生这样一个问题：为什么不认为印度是一个大国？显然，事情之所以这样，是因为殖民主义者要轻视你们的国家，要轻视你们的人民。承认印度是一个大国，就需要他们改变他们的态度。但是，我们相信，印度是一个大国，应该在世界大国的行列中取得一个一等国家的地位。
    我还想对下面这一点说几句话。有些人指责尼·亚·布尔加宁和我在使东方同西方对立。这当然是粗暴的捏造。我们的国家代表着欧洲和亚洲。我们过去是、现在仍然是反对世界的一部分同另一部分的任何对立，我们反对一个大洲统治另一个大洲。
    我们希望所有的人民得到独立，并且按照他们自己的愿望发展，我们希望他们用一切办法提高他们的经济和文化，在和平和友好的气氛中生活。
