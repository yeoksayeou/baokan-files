Recently, many state-owned commercial departments in Wuhan have implemented a "Covenant of Counter Service: Choosing without Displeasure, Asking without Annoyance." However, some employees in some units have not implemented it well, still treating customers with their usual impatient or even rude attitudes. Once, a couple went to the Qiaokou branch of the Wuhan Department Store to buy children's clothes. There were too few styles of clothes, and the two picked and chose but were not satisfied. How did the salesperson who received them implement the "Choosing without Displeasure" covenant? He said to the customers, "Go to the door and hold a family meeting, draw a design, and bring it back to us for processing!" A customer wanted to buy women's trousers, but the sizes in the store were all too large. He wanted to choose a smaller size, but the salesperson told him to go to the children's clothing counter to choose. An old woman went to the Municipal Retail Company to buy meat and felt the meat was not good. She asked the salesperson to change it, but the salesperson not only refused to change it but said to her fiercely, "Pork is like this, I won't change it. What can you do? If you can't stand it, just go and die by hitting your head against a telephone pole!" They treat customers with such an attitude, no wonder people criticize the service covenants of these units as "just hanging up signs and putting on a show."

Why does this phenomenon of inconsistent words and deeds continue to occur in some state-owned stores without being corrected? The main reason is that the leaders of these units are satisfied with the fact that the "Choosing without Displeasure, Asking without Annoyance" service covenant has already been placed on the counters of their units, thinking that there is no problem once the employees have signed the covenant. However, customers not only "hear their words" but also "observe their actions." These comrades should quickly check the implementation of the service covenant and educate the employees of their units to earnestly implement the service covenant.

    虚设的服务公约
    最近，武汉市很多国营商业部门的门市部都推行了“百挑不厌，百问不烦”的柜台服务公约。但是，有些单位的营业员没有很好执行，仍然以平时惯有的不耐烦的甚至粗暴的态度对待顾客。有一次，一对夫妇到市百货公司硚口门市部买小孩衣服，衣服的式样太少，两人挑来挑去总不称心。接待他们的营业员怎样执行“百挑不厌”的公约呢？他对顾客说：“你们到门口去开个家庭会，绘好图样拿来我们给你加工！”有个顾客买女裤，店里的号码都大，想挑一件号码小点的，没想到营业员却叫他到童装柜去挑选。有个老太婆到市零售公司买肉，觉得肉不好，要求营业员换一块，营业员不仅不换，反而声色俱厉地对她说：“猪肉就是这样，我不换，看你怎么办？你气不过，就在电线杆上撞死算了！”他们用这样的态度对待顾客，难怪人们批评这些单位的服务公约是“挂挂牌子，摆摆样子”。
    为什么这种言行不符的现象在一些国营商店里连续发生而得不到纠正呢？主要是这些单位的领导人员，满足于本单位柜台上已经摆上了“百挑不厌，百问不烦”的服务公约，以为职工们订了公约就没问题了。但是，顾客是不只“听其言”，而且要“观其行”的。这些同志应该赶快检查服务公约执行情况，教育本单位的营业员认真执行服务公约。
