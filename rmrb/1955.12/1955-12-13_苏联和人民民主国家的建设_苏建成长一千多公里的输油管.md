Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Soviet Union Builds Oil Pipeline Over 1,000 Kilometers Long
    The "Pravda" reported that a pipeline with a total length of 1,332 kilometers has recently been built in the Soviet Union. This pipeline, from Tuimazy in the Bashkir Autonomous Republic to Omsk in western Siberia, is one of the longest pipelines in the Soviet Union. Through the pumping stations on this pipeline, Bashkir oil can be transported to the Omsk refinery.
    The construction of this pipeline was very arduous. The pipeline had to cross the Ural Mountains and pass through the Belaya River, the Ufimka River, the Sim River, the Tobol River, and the Irtysh River. Construction workers excavated and filled a total of more than 4 million cubic meters of soil and laid tens of thousands of tons of steel pipes. Many powerful machines were used during construction, including a ditch digger that could dig a kilometer-long trench per hour.
    Czechoslovakia's First Shuttleless Loom Workshop
    Czechoslovakia's first weaving workshop equipped with the world's most advanced shuttleless looms has recently been partially put into production at the Semily Textile Factory. The shuttleless looms used in this workshop are newly created by the Czechoslovak textile machinery manufacturing industry. The machines are more than twice as efficient as ordinary looms, take up less space, use less electricity, and do not have the noise of ordinary looms.
    Czechoslovakia has now successfully manufactured two types of shuttleless looms. One loom is 105 centimeters wide and can weave 400 wefts per minute, more than twice as fast as an ordinary loom, and the woven cloth is very fine, with an average of 55 weft threads per centimeter. It can weave not only cotton cloth, but also silk, linen, and other fabrics. The other shuttleless loom is only 45 centimeters wide and even faster, weaving 700 wefts per minute.
    Romania's Lenin Hydropower Station's Water Supply Tunnel Project Tunnelled Through 100 Days Ahead of Schedule
    On December 11, the builders of the Lenin Hydropower Station, the largest project in Romania's Ten-Year Electrification Plan, tunnelled through the several-kilometer-long water supply tunnel that guides the Bistrița River water to drive the hydropower station's turbines 100 days ahead of schedule.
    The Lenin Hydropower Station is being built in the Bicaz area, and its generating capacity will reach 210,000 kilowatts, equivalent to one-third of the total generating capacity of all power stations in Romania in 1950. After completion, it can generate 430 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. The early completion of the hydropower station's water supply tunnel will greatly facilitate the rapid completion of the hydropower station project.
    Bulgaria Produces First Corn Harvesting Combine
    The Dimitrov Agricultural Machinery Factory in Ruse, Bulgaria's largest agricultural machinery factory, recently successfully manufactured the country's first corn harvesting combine. The trial use of this harvesting combine is good. It can harvest 5 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) to 7 hectares of corn per day. The factory plans to start mass production of this harvesting combine next year.
    The Dimitrov Agricultural Machinery Factory has developed from a small factory, not much larger than a repair shop, since liberation. Since 1948, this factory has produced more than 70,000 various agricultural machines for the country. At present, it produces a total of 72 types of agricultural machines, including grain harvesting combines, sugar beet harvesting combines, narrow-row seeders, and so on.
    Poland Makes New Type of Car Inner Tube Without Air Pores
    After several years of research, the Stomil Factory in Poznan, Poland, has successfully trial-produced a new type of car inner tube without air pores.
    The advantages of this tire are: when the tire is punctured by needles or other objects, the air will not escape immediately, and it can continue to travel for at least 600 kilometers without exploding, thus reducing traffic accidents caused by inner tube ruptures; moreover, it is easy to repair without having to remove the tire from the wheel for repair.
    After testing, this tire has shown good results and will continue to be tested in order to start mass production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏建成长一千多公里的输油管
    “真理报”报道，一条全长达一千三百三十二公里的输油管最近在苏联建成了。这条从巴什基尔自治共和国的图伊马兹通到西伯利亚西部鄂木斯克的输油管是苏联最长的输油管之一。通过这条输油管上的汲油站，巴什基尔的石油就可以输送到鄂木斯克的炼油厂。
    这条输油管的工程十分艰巨。油管要穿过乌拉尔山脉，经过白河、乌菲姆卡河、西姆河、托波尔河和额尔齐斯河。建筑工人们挖掘和填平的泥土共有四百多万立方公尺，敷设的钢管共有好几万吨。在建筑时应用了许多效力强大的机器，其中有一种掘土机每小时可以掘长一公里的坑道。
    捷第一个无梭织布机车间
    捷克斯洛伐克第一个用世界上最先进的无梭织布机装备的织布车间，最近在国内塞米利纺织工厂部分投入生产了。这个车间使用的无梭织布机是捷克斯洛伐克纺织机器制造业新近创制出来的。机器的生产效率比普通织布机高一倍以上，它们占地小，用电少，而且没有普通织布机的噪音。
    捷克斯洛伐克目前已经制造成功了两种无梭织布机。一种织布机宽一百零五公分，每分钟可以穿纬四百根，比普通织布机快一倍，织出的布很细，每公分布平均有五十五根纬纱。它不仅可以织棉布，而且可以织丝、麻等织品。另一种无梭织布机只有四十五公分宽，速度更快，每分钟可以穿纬七百根。
    罗列宁水电站的供水隧道工程提前一百天凿通
    十二月十一日，罗马尼亚十年电气化计划中最大的列宁水电站的建筑者，提前一百天凿通了引导比斯特里查河水推动水电站涡轮机的数公里长的供水隧道。
    列宁水电站建筑在贝卡兹地方，它的发电能力将达到二十一万瓩，相当于一九五零年罗马尼亚全国发电站发电能力的三分之一。工程完工后，它每年可以发出四亿三千万度的电。水电站供水隧道的提前凿通，将大大便利水电站工程的迅速完成。
    保出产第一台玉蜀黍收获联合机
    保加利亚全国最大的农业机器工厂——鲁西市的季米特洛夫农业机器工厂，最近制造成功了本国第一台玉蜀黍收获联合机。这台收获联合机试用情况良好。它每天可以收五公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）到七公顷的玉蜀黍。工厂准备在明年开始大量生产这种收获联合机。
    季米特洛夫农业机器工厂是解放以来由一个比修理车间大不了多少的小工厂发展起来的。从一九四八年以来，这个工厂已经为国家生产了七万多台各种农业机器。目前它所生产的农业机器共有七十二种，其中包括谷物收获联合机、甜菜收获联合机、窄行播种机等等。
    波制成没有气孔的新式汽车内胎
    波兰波兹南地方的斯托米尔工厂经过几年的研究，试制成功了一种新式的没有打气孔的汽车内胎。
    这种轮胎的优点是：轮胎被针刺等物刺破时，空气不致立即逸出，最少还能继续行驶六百公里，并且不致爆炸，因而减少了由于内胎破裂而发生的行车事故；而且，修理方便，不必将轮胎自车轮上拆下来修理。
    这种轮胎经试验后，效果良好，将继续进行试验，以便大量生产。（据新华社讯）
