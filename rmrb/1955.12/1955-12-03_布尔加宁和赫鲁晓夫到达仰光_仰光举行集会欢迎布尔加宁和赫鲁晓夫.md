Xinhua News Agency, TASS, Rangoon, December 1st — Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, arrived in Rangoon, the capital of Burma, from Calcutta, India, at 1:00 PM on December 1st. Welcoming them at the airport were Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, Burmese government officials, representatives from all sectors, foreign diplomatic envoys, and thousands of Rangoon residents.

After the Soviet leaders disembarked, a 19-gun salute was fired at the airport. Bulganin and Khrushchev, accompanied by U Nu, inspected the guard of honor. Then, U Nu delivered a welcoming speech. He warmly welcomed Bulganin and Khrushchev on behalf of the government and people of the Union of Burma. He said, "I still clearly remember the extremely pleasant experiences during my stay in your great and hospitable country. I can assure you that the Burmese leaders and people not only regard you as friends and sympathizers, but also love you like family."

Bulganin then delivered a reply speech. He first extended warm greetings to the government and people of Burma on behalf of the Soviet government and the Soviet people. He said: "The people of the Soviet Union and Burma both aspire to establish full understanding between the two countries, and to strengthen and develop friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation between them, for the benefit of peace and security throughout the world."

Bulganin said that the Soviet people warmly sympathize with and are deeply concerned about the Burmese government's contributions to maintaining and strengthening peace in Asia and the world, and the Burmese people's efforts to ensure the economic independence of their motherland. We firmly believe that our visit to Burma will greatly contribute to further developing understanding between our two governments and peoples, and to further strengthening friendly relations between the two countries. Finally, amidst stormy applause, he exclaimed: "Long live the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Burmese peoples!"

Subsequently, Bulganin and Khrushchev, together with U Nu, traveled to the city center by car. The streets they passed were decorated with the national flags of the Soviet Union and the Union of Burma. Many colorful arches were erected along the streets, adorned with numerous banners bearing slogans such as "Long Live Soviet-Burmese Friendship!", "Heartfelt Respect to Premier Bulganin!", and "Heartfelt Respect to Comrade Khrushchev!". Music and cheers filled the air along the way. Large crowds of Rangoon citizens lined the streets, waving flowers and flags to welcome the distinguished Soviet guests.

Xinhua News Agency, quoting TASS, Rangoon, reported that the Mayor of Rangoon, U Sheng Pei, held a civic reception at the City Hall at 5:00 PM on December 1st to welcome Bulganin and Khrushchev. Attending the reception were government officials, members of both houses of parliament, foreign diplomatic envoys, and people from all walks of life in Rangoon.

After the national anthems of the Soviet Union and the Union of Burma were played, Bulganin, Khrushchev, and their entourage ascended the podium. Joining them on the podium were Burmese Prime Minister U Nu and Rangoon Mayor U Sheng Pei.

The Mayor of Rangoon, who presided over the reception, delivered a welcoming speech to the guests.

Bulganin then addressed the audience amidst warm applause. He first expressed his gratitude and respect to the Burmese government and people. He said: "Relations between the Soviet Union and Burma are based on the unshakable principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence, and economic cooperation. These well-known principles were solemnly affirmed not long ago in the Soviet-Burmese Joint Statement. Recently, the friendship and business ties between the Soviet and Burmese peoples have been developing increasingly. The visit of Burmese Prime Minister U Nu to the Soviet Union is an important factor in further developing the spirit of cooperation and trust between our two countries."

Bulganin said: "Your country's declaration of independence and embarkation on the path of national liberation and economic revitalization is one of the many significant changes that have recently taken place in Asia. The Asian countries, striving to consolidate their independence and sovereignty and opposing all manifestations of colonialism, are now a new and powerful factor in international relations. The historic Bandung Asian-African Conference best demonstrated the increasing role of the East in international affairs. We hope that the upcoming Second Asian-African Conference will make new and significant contributions to the cause of consolidating universal peace, further easing international tensions, and promoting the development of cooperation among peoples of all countries."

He said: "The just struggle of the Asian peoples for national liberation has won the deep sympathy and moral support of the Soviet people. The Soviet Union advocates equality for all nations, regardless of size. The Soviet Union pursues a policy of actively striving for peace, opposing war and foreign interference, and advocating the resolution of all international issues through negotiations and agreements. The Asian peoples also advocate peace and are fighting against the threat of war. The Soviet people and the people of many countries in Asia share consistent views in this noble cause and are allies."

Bulganin then spoke about the significant efforts made by the Soviet Union in striving for peace and easing international tensions. He said: "The Soviet Union has put forward constructive proposals on one of the most important issues of the day, disarmament. We firmly believe that atomic and hydrogen weapons should be banned, and conventional armaments should be drastically reduced. Effective international supervision should be established for the implementation of these measures. We also believe that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference should, while beginning to reduce armed forces and conventional armaments, undertake the obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. The Burmese people and their government also advocate the banning of atomic and hydrogen weapons and call for disarmament. This is an important contribution to the cause of striving for peace and building international trust. The Soviet people highly appreciate the efforts made by the Burmese government in the struggle for peace."

Bulganin concluded by saying: "Now, your people are striving to overcome the difficulties left over from past colonial rule, and are consolidating the national economy and their own industry. On behalf of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, I wish you success on the road to your country's development and prosperity. Expanding friendship and business ties between our two countries is in the interests of both parties."

After the speech, Bulganin and Khrushchev shook hands warmly with Burmese Prime Minister U Nu.

Next, Prime Minister U Nu spoke. U Nu said that the Burmese people have been waiting for your visit to our country, and they fully understand the importance of this visit to consolidating world peace and Soviet-Burmese friendship. Humanity's desire for peace is absolutely legitimate and natural. The only path to avoiding war and maintaining peace is the path of peaceful coexistence taken by the people of our two countries. Now, more and more countries are recognizing the principles of peaceful coexistence, because the goal of these principles is first and foremost to strengthen peace and develop cooperation between countries.

U Nu said that your visit to our country will not only open up great possibilities for developing economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries, but will also greatly help expand the area of peace.

The civic reception concluded here. Afterwards, a Burmese ethnic song and dance performance was held for the guests.

    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫到达仰光
    仰光举行集会欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫
    新华社塔斯社仰光一日讯  苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫在十二月一日下午一时从印度的加尔各答到达缅甸首都仰光。在机场上欢迎的有缅甸总理吴努、缅甸政府官员、各界代表、各国外交使节和数千名仰光居民。
    苏联领袖们下飞机后，机场上响起了十九响礼炮。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同吴努检阅了仪仗队。然后，吴努致欢迎词。他代表缅甸联邦政府和人民热烈欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。他说，在我的心里，仍旧清楚地记忆着我在你们伟大而好客的国家中逗留时的极其愉快的情景。我可以向你们保证，缅甸领袖和人民不仅把你们当做朋友和同情者，而且像亲人一样地热爱你们。
    布尔加宁接着致答词。他首先代表苏联政府和苏联人民向缅甸政府和人民热烈致意。他说：苏联和缅甸两国人民都渴望建立两国之间的充分谅解，加强和发展他们之间的友谊和相互有利的合作，以利于全世界的和平和安全。
    布尔加宁说，苏联人民热烈同情和深切关注缅甸政府在维护和加强亚洲和世界和平方面所作的贡献以及缅甸人民为保证他们祖国的经济独立所作的努力。我们深信，我们到缅甸的访问，对于进一步发展我们两国政府和人民之间的谅解，对于进一步加强两国之间的友好关系将有很大贡献。最后，他在暴风雨般的掌声中高呼：苏联和缅甸人民的友谊和合作万岁！
    随后，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同吴努一起乘汽车前往市内。他们经过的街道悬挂着苏联和缅甸联邦的国旗。街道上搭着许多彩门，挂着许多横幅，横幅上面写着“苏缅两国友谊万岁！”“向布尔加宁总理致衷心的敬意！”“向赫鲁晓夫同志致衷心的敬意！”沿途到处都是音乐和欢呼声。大群的仰光市民拿着鲜花和旗子，夹道欢迎苏联贵客们。
    新华社据塔斯社仰光讯　仰光市长吴盛佩十二月一日下午五时在市政厅举行市民欢迎会，欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。出席欢迎会的有政府官员、国会两院的议员，各国外交使节和仰光各界人士。
    在奏过苏联和缅甸联邦两国国歌以后，布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫以及他们的随行人员登上了讲台。同他们一起登上讲台的还有缅甸总理吴努和仰光市长吴盛佩。
    主持欢迎会的仰光市长向客人们致欢迎词。
    布尔加宁接着在热烈的掌声中致词。他首先对缅甸政府和人民表示感谢和敬意。他说：苏联和缅甸之间的关系是以互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处和实行经济合作这样一些不可动摇的原则为基础的。不久以前，在苏缅联合声明中已郑重地肯定了这些远近闻名的原则。最近，苏缅两国人民的友谊和事务联系正在日益发展。缅甸总理吴努的访问苏联，是进
  一步发展我们两国之间的合作和信任精神的重要因素。
    布尔加宁说：你们国家宣布了独立，走上了民族自由和经济复兴的道路，这是最近在亚洲所发生的许多巨大变化的标志之一。为巩固自己的独立和主权，反对殖民主义的一切表现而斗争的亚洲各国人民，现在是国际关系中的一个新的、强大的因素。具有历史意义的万隆亚非国家会议最好地证明了东方在国际事务中的作用在日益增长。我们希望将要召开的第二次亚非国家会议将对巩固普遍和平的事业作出新的重大的贡献，并且将促进国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，和促进各国人民之间合作的发展。
    他说：亚洲各国人民争取民族解放的正义斗争获得苏联人民的深切同情和道义上的支持。苏联主张各民族不分大小、一律平等。苏联执行着积极争取和平、反对战争和外国干涉的政策，主张通过谈判和协议的办法解决一切国际问题。亚洲各国人民也主张和平，并且在为反对战争威胁而斗争。苏联人民和亚洲许多国家的人民在这个崇高的事业中有着一致的观点，并且是同盟者。
    布尔加宁接着谈到了苏联在争取和平及缓和国际紧张局势方面所作的重大努力。他说：苏联就当前最重要的问题之一裁军问题提出了建设性的建议。我们坚决认为，原子武器和氢武器应当禁止，常规军备应当大大裁减。对这些措施的实现应当建立有效的国际监督。我们还认为，日内瓦会议的参加国应当在开始裁减武装部队和常规军备的同时，承担不首先使用核子武器的义务。缅甸人民和他们的政府也主张禁止原子武器和氢武器，要求裁减军备。这是对争取和平和建立国际信任事业的一个重要的贡献。苏联人民对于缅甸政府在争取和平的斗争中所作的努力有着很高的评价。
    布尔加宁最后说：现在，你们的人民正在尽力克服过去的殖民统治遗留下来的困难，正在巩固国家的经济和自己的工业。我代表苏联政府和苏联人民祝你们在你们国家的发展和繁荣的道路上获得成就。扩大我们两国之间的友谊和事务联系是符合双方利益的。
    讲话完毕以后，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同缅甸总理吴努紧紧地握手。
    接着，吴努总理讲话。吴努说，缅甸人民一直在等待你们光临我国，他们充分了解到这次访问对巩固世界和平和对苏缅友谊的重要性。人类要求和平的愿望是绝对正当而自然的。避免战争和维护和平的唯一道路就是我们两国人民所采取的和平共处的道路。现在承认和平共处的原则的国家是愈来愈多了，因为这些原则的目标首先是加强和平和发展国与国之间的合作。
    吴努说，你们在我国的访问，不仅将打开发展我们两国之间的经济和文化合作的巨大可能性，并且将大大地有助于扩大和平地区。
    市民欢迎会至此结束，会后为客人们举行了缅甸民族歌舞会。
