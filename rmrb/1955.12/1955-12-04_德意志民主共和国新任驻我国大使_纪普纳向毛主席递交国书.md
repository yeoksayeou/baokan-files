Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the German Democratic Republic to China, Richard Gipner, accompanied by Counselor Grutner, Commercial Counselor Duerber, and other diplomatic officials, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China on the afternoon of the 3rd. Present were Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Yu Xinqing, Director of the Protocol Bureau of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Chen Chu, Director of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ke Hua, Director of the Protocol Department.

When Ambassador Gipner presented his credentials, he delivered a eulogy to Chairman Mao Zedong, saying that close and friendly relations exist between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China, which were both founded in October 1949. The common struggle for peace and socialism unites the people of our two countries. The German people deeply admire the Chinese people for never fearing any difficulties and for the significant achievements made in the political, economic, and cultural fields under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party in the short period since the founding of the People's Republic of China. During this period, the People's Republic of China has developed into a world power for peace and has made great contributions to easing international tensions and maintaining peace in Asia, thereby safeguarding world peace. The German people are proud of this friendship with the great Chinese people and are always ready to give the Chinese people fraternal assistance. The continuous development of friendly relations and cooperation between our two countries not only meets the common interests of our two peoples but also strengthens the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism throughout the world, led by the powerful Soviet Union.

In his reply, Chairman Mao Zedong said that the German Democratic Republic is the first truly peace-loving and democratic state in German history. The German Democratic Republic has achieved great success in building socialism and striving for the peaceful reunification of Germany, as well as in the struggle to defend European and world peace. The German Democratic Republic has become a strong fortress of peace and democracy in all of Germany and an important factor in maintaining European security and world peace. I believe that the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic and the struggle of the German people for the peaceful reunification of Germany will surely win greater victories. In this struggle, the German people will continue to receive the full support of the Chinese people. Over the past few years, the close cooperation between our two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields has made the friendship between our two peoples increasingly consolidated and developed. This comprehensive cooperation and fraternal friendship are in line with the common interests and aspirations of our two peoples and strengthen the forces of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union.
