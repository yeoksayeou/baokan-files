Comrade Liu Shusen was originally a revolutionary soldier who received one third-class merit and two fourth-class merits in the War of Liberation. He was demobilized and transferred to civilian work in 1952, serving as the Deputy Secretary of the Shipan Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Zhaohua County, Sichuan Province. Before the autumn harvest of 1954, the mutual aid group he led was approved to establish an agricultural production cooperative, and he was elected as the cooperative's director. Over the past year, thanks to the leadership and assistance of the district committee and branch, as well as Comrade Liu Shusen's own continuous efforts, the agricultural production cooperative he leads has achieved increased production in both the spring and autumn harvests this year. Under the influence of the agricultural production cooperative he leads, six agricultural production cooperatives have now been established in the township, making it a basically collectivized township.

Liu Shusen has gained some experience in leading the agricultural production cooperative over the past year.

**发挥集体领导作用 (Give Play to the Role of Collective Leadership)**

Giving play to the role of collective leadership is one of the important methods for running a cooperative well. Liu Shusen gradually came to understand this principle after a period of practical work. Initially, he did not like to discuss many of the cooperative's tasks with other comrades in the Party group or other members of the cooperative management committee, and mostly handled them alone. As a result, it caused disunity among the cooperative's cadres, and many cooperative members were also dissatisfied with him. The cooperative's work suffered a lot of losses. In January of this year, when weeding the rapeseed fields, he did not consult with the cooperative's cadres beforehand and assigned the cooperative members to weeding on his own. More than one mu of rapeseed field was not weeded, and some members of the cooperative management committee and cooperative members knew about it but did not weed it or report it. Later, farmers outside the cooperative pointed out to Liu Shusen that the weeds had grown very deep, and only then did he send cooperative members to weed them. Some members of the cooperative management committee said: This is just the work arranged by the director alone! Later, he studied the experience introduced in the Sichuan Daily about how a cooperative was run well due to giving play to the role of collective leadership, and only then did he begin to realize the importance of giving play to the role of collective leadership. From then on, he paid attention to consulting with everyone on everything, and as a result, the members of the cooperative management committee were united, and things within the cooperative became easier to handle. According to him, in order to give play to the role of collective leadership and the enthusiasm of all cooperative members in running the cooperative, the director must do the following two things well:

First, the members of the cooperative management committee must have a clear division of labor, and major issues must be studied collectively and assigned to specific individuals to be responsible for. In addition to being responsible for overall work, Liu Shusen himself is mainly responsible for political and ideological education; Vice Director Zhou Guifang and Committee Member Zhang Mingyi are responsible for leading the cooperative's production; Committee Member Wu Changdi leads the work of the Youth League; Committee Member Guo Yingzhen leads women's work; Committee Member Wu Huashan leads the spare-time school; other committee members are responsible for assisting the captains in leading the production team in which they are located. In daily work, each is responsible for their own duties, and the cooperative committee meets once every half month to collectively study major issues within the cooperative. When expanding the cooperative last winter, Liu Shusen first held a Party group meeting to study and unify the thoughts of Party members, making everyone realize the importance of expanding the cooperative, and studying the targets and number of households for expansion, and explaining the methods. Then, an enlarged meeting of the cooperative committee cadres was held, and the preliminary opinions studied by the Party group were handed over to everyone for deliberation and discussion; after reaching a consensus, specific division of labor and responsibility was assigned. As a result, not only was the task completed on time, but also the working ability of the cadres was improved. Now many cadres in the cooperative can work independently.

Second, humbly accept the criticisms and suggestions of the cooperative members. Liu Shusen believes that leading an agricultural cooperative is a new task, and he cannot possibly consider everything so carefully. As long as he listens to the opinions of the cooperative members more often, there will be no deviations. Whenever he makes a work report at the cooperative members' meeting, he humbly examines his own and the cooperative management committee's shortcomings in their work. Usually, if a cooperative member raises any criticism or suggestion to him, he always considers and accepts it humbly. During drought prevention and resistance this year, more than three mu of land in the third production team could not be transplanted after the transplanting season, and it was impossible to transfer labor to plant dry crops, but the time for changing crops was very tight and needed to be sown immediately. Liu Shusen's original opinion was to wait for the third production team to finish planting the corn in the fields before changing crops on this plot of land. If this was done, the farming season would be missed. Later, Production Captain Zhang Mingquan suggested: Draw labor from various teams to make a concentrated effort, first change the crops on the third team's land, and then plant the remaining corn in each team (note: because the land is easier to plant than the fields). Liu Shusen accepted this suggestion, immediately discussed with the cadres about transferring labor, and finished changing the crops in just half a day.

**深入重点创造经验 (Go Deep into Key Areas and Create Experience)**

Liu Shusen is good at specifically applying the leadership method of going deep into key areas, creating experience, and then promoting it comprehensively. After expanding the cooperative in February of this year, due to the fact that the cooperative only had long-term plans and no short-term arrangements, the production order was chaotic, forming the phenomenon of "arranging work every night." The cooperative members felt that there were too many meetings, and the members of the cooperative management committee and the production team captains felt that the work could not be promoted. Some production team captains said: I don't want to be this captain, I'd rather be a cooperative member. Some cooperative members wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. With the help of the branch, Liu Shusen first specifically helped the captains of the second and third production teams (out of a total of seven teams in the cooperative) to arrange labor and tasks, making short-term arrangements for three days, and at the same time implementing the practice of evaluating work and recording points on the work site. This worked very well. Then, a meeting of cooperative cadres was convened, and the captain of the second team, Gong Qihua, introduced this method of short-term arrangement. After the entire cooperative adopted this method, it basically eliminated the chaotic phenomenon in production. There were ten mu of riverside land in the cooperative, which was prone to flooding and had never been planted with grain. Liu Shusen believed that it was a pity not to plant grain on such a large piece of fertile land. He held a meeting to mobilize the cooperative members to plant sorghum on this land, explaining to everyone that the seeds and labor required for planting sorghum were not much, and even if it was flooded, the loss would not be great. However, the cooperative members were unwilling to plant, and even some production team captains were unwilling to plant, fearing that the harvest would be unreliable. Later, he first went to the second team to mobilize them; after the second team planted two plots of land, he held a cooperative members' meeting and used the fact that the second team had already planted two plots of land to mobilize the other teams. At this time, the captain of the third team, Zhang Mingzhi, said: If the second team is not afraid of the unreliable harvest, what are we afraid of? Some cooperative members also said: Let's try it. As a result, all the riverside sandy land was planted with sorghum, which not only was not flooded, but also grew very well, and it is estimated that at least more than 4,000 jin of sorghum can be harvested. The cooperative members reflected: This is the benefit of joining the cooperative.

**关心社员个人疾苦 (Care About the Personal Hardships of Cooperative Members)**

Liu Shusen believes that if the collective interests of the cooperative are not combined with the personal interests of the cooperative members, and the personal interests of the cooperative members frequently conflict with the collective interests of the cooperative, the cooperative will definitely not be run well. Therefore, he is very concerned about this issue. In March of this year, the cooperative sold garlic sprouts, and it was originally decided to borrow according to the investment and labor work points, borrowing more for those with more and less for those with less. Later, it was learned that some cooperative members had less investment and labor work points, but were currently experiencing financial difficulties, so he convened a meeting of the cooperative management committee to study and change the original decision: those with financial difficulties would borrow more, and those without difficulties would borrow less. In this way, individual cooperative members were helped to overcome their difficulties. On the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival in August of this year, some cooperative members reflected: We still say we want to eat meat, but we don't even have the money to buy salt. He discussed this with other members of the cooperative management committee and sold more than 1,600 jin of tobacco leaves in advance, borrowing the money to cooperative members in need to spend the festival. The cooperative members reflected: This is truly a good director who serves us.

Liu Shusen pays special attention to cooperative members with large populations, few laborers, and relatively difficult lives. Cooperative members Yang Youen, Zhang Fuhong, Zhang Mingde, etc., some lack labor, some are sick, and some are disabled. If the method of allocating labor within the cooperative is followed, they will not be able to maintain the workdays they did before joining the cooperative, and their income will be affected. Liu Shusen convened a meeting of the cooperative management committee to study and decided that, under the principle of not affecting production, they should be appropriately assigned more light and miscellaneous tasks to take care of them. In this way, the income of eight or nine households of cooperative members in difficulty was guaranteed.

**培养社员集体主义思想 (Cultivate Cooperative Members' Collectivist Ideology)**

Liu Shusen pays special attention to conducting collectivist ideological education for all cooperative members. He mainly grasps specific examples of good and bad, and conducts education by means of commendation and criticism. In the first half of this year, some individual female cooperative members secretly went to the fields to pick green broad beans without the permission of the cooperative; some cadres showed departmentalism and selfishness; on the other hand, some cooperative members were very concerned about the collective interests, such as cooperative members Zhang Huaiyu and Zhang Mingzong, who automatically helped to raise the wheat and rapeseed that had fallen on the road when they saw them, and took the initiative to propose to the production team captain what work needed to be done and discussed it with him. After Liu Shusen grasped these typical examples of good and bad, he convened a cooperative members' meeting, praised the cooperative members Zhang Huaiyu, Zhang Mingzong, etc., who worked well, were active in production, and cared about the collective interests, criticized the cooperative members and cooperative cadres who did not care about the collective interests of the cooperative, and organized the cooperative members to carry out discussions. The cooperative members all conducted inspections in connection with reality, criticizing their own thoughts and behaviors that did not care about the collective interests. After the distribution, he once again educated the cooperative members on the superiority of cooperation by summarizing the experience of increased production. The cooperative members all realized the benefits of joining the cooperative from their own personal experience, and therefore their collectivist ideology became stronger and stronger. For example, the rapeseed stalks (used as firewood) distributed to female cooperative member Zhang Wanhua still had rapeseed that had not been harvested cleanly. She harvested them a second time, harvested more than two jin of rapeseed, and sent them back to the cooperative. There are many other similar examples in this cooperative.

**任劳任怨，大公无私 (Hardworking and Complaint-Free, Selfless and Impartial)**

The cooperative members of this cooperative unanimously reflect that Liu Shusen is active in his work and selfless and impartial. This reflection is based on facts. Sometimes, Liu Shusen does not go home all day for the sake of the cooperative's work. When the cooperative is harvesting grain and distributing it, he always goes everywhere with other cooperative cadres in the middle of the night to check the storage of grain to see if there is any spillage or mold. His wife's thinking is very backward, saying that he only cares about the cooperative and not about the family, but he is never discouraged and still actively engages in the work of the cooperative. When distributing grain, he does not say a word about whether the grain he distributes is good or bad. When distributing corn stalks, other cooperative members are distributed to a concentrated location, which is easier to transport; the ones distributed to him are scattered in three locations, and his wife complains behind his back, but he says: What does it matter, just run a few more trips and carry them. Before the distribution of the spring harvest this year, the garlic sprouts planted by forty-two new cooperative members were "whoever plants, whoever harvests," and the garlic sprouts planted by thirty-two old cooperative members were distributed separately from the grain. However, in the distribution of the spring harvest, other members of the cooperative management committee and cooperative members forgot to remove the garlic sprout land that each household of old cooperative members had already distributed from the total cultivated land area of the entire cooperative, and were preparing to start the distribution. Liu Shusen himself is an old cooperative member, and he felt that there was a problem with this distribution. He proposed that the garlic sprout land that had already been distributed should be removed from the total cultivated land area of the entire cooperative before the distribution is reasonable. Otherwise, a portion of the old cooperative members' land dividends would be duplicated, and the new cooperative members would suffer. This reminded everyone, and then they proceeded with the distribution according to the method he mentioned above, so as to achieve fairness and rationality.

    转业军人刘树森领导农业合作社的经验
    王永全
    刘树森同志原来是在解放战争中立过一次三等功、两次四等功的革命军人，一九五二年复员转业，担任中共四川省昭化县石盘乡支部副书记。一九五四年秋收前他所领导的互助组被批准办农业生产合作社，他被选为合作社的社长。一年多来，由于区委、支部的领导和帮助以及刘树森同志本身的不断努力，他所领导的农业生产合作社今年的大春、小春都获得增产。在他领导的农业生产合作社的影响下，现在这个乡建立了六个农业生产合作社，成为基本上合作化的乡了。
    刘树森一年来在领导农业生产合作社的工作中，得到了一些经验。
    发挥集体领导作用
    发挥集体领导作用，是办好社的重要方法之一。这个道理，刘树森是经过了一段时间的实际工作后才逐步体会到的。起初，社里很多工作，他都不爱同党小组其他同志和社务委员会其他社务委员商量，多半都是一个人包办。结果，引起社干部之间不团结，很多社员也对他不满。社的工作受到了不少损失。今年一月份，油菜田薅草的时候，他事前没有同社干部很好研究，就一个人分派社员去薅草，有一亩多油菜田没有薅，有的社务委员和社员知道了也不薅，也不反映。后来社外农民向刘树森提出来，草已经长得很深了，他才派社员去薅。有的社务委员说：这就是社长一个人布置的工作嘛！后来，他学习了四川日报上介绍的由于发挥集体领导作用办好了社的经验，才开始认识到发挥集体领导作用的重要性。从此，他就注意到事事同大家商量，结果社务委员们团结了，社内的事情也好办了。据他谈，要发挥集体领导作用和全体社员的办社的积极性，当社长的必须做好以下两件事情：
    首先，是社务委员要明确分工，重大问题经过集体研究和指定专人负责。刘树森本人除负责全面工作外，还主要负责政治思想教育工作；副社长周贵方、社委张明义负责领导全社生产；社委吴长弟领导团的工作；社委郭应珍领导妇女工作；社委吴华山领导业余学校；其他社委在哪个生产队就负责协助队长领导哪个队。在日常工作中，各负各的责任，半月开一次社委会，集体研究社内重大问题。去年冬季扩大社的时候，刘树森事先召开党小组会进行研究，统一党员思想，使大家认识到扩社工作的重要性，并且研究了扩社对象、户数，交代了作法。接着召开了社委扩大干部会议，把党小组研究出来的初步意见交大家酝酿讨论；取得一致意见后，即具体分工负责，结果不但按时完成了任务，而且提高了干部的工作能力。现在社内很多干部都能独当一面地工作了。
    其次，是虚心接受社员群众的批评和建议。刘树森认为：领导农业合作社是个新的工作，自己不可能考虑得那么周到，只要多多倾听社员的意见，就不会出什么偏差。他每逢在社员大会上作工作报告，都要虚心地检查他本人和社务委员在工作中的缺点。平常有社员向他提出什么批评、建议，他总是虚心地考虑和接受。今年防旱抗旱的时候，第三生产队有三亩多田，栽秧季节已经过了，改种旱粮劳力又调配不过来，但是改种时间又很紧迫，需要立即下种。刘树森原来的意见是等第三生产队把地里的玉米点完后再来改种这块田。如果照这样去做，就要违误农时。后来生产队长张明全建议：从各队抽出劳动力来突击，先把第三队的田改种上，然后再点各队剩下的玉米（按：因地比田好种些）。刘树森接受了这个建议，立即同干部研究抽调劳动力，只用大半天时间就把田改种完了。
    深入重点创造经验
    刘树森善于具体运用深入重点，创造经验，然后推广全面的领导方法。今年二月份扩社后，由于社内只有长计划，没有短安排，生产秩序混乱，形成“夜夜排工”的现象。社员感到会太多，社务委员和生产队长感到工作推不动，有的生产队长说：我不当这个队长，我情愿当个社员好些。有的社员要退社。刘树森在支部的帮助下，首先在第二、三生产队（全社共七个队）具体帮助队长进行劳力、活路排队，作出三天的短安排，同时实行在工地上评工记分。这样做效果很好。接着就召开社干部会，由二队队长宫启华介绍了这种短安排的办法。全社采用了这个办法以后，基本上消除了生产上的混乱现象。社内有十亩河边地，易遭水淹，从来没有种过粮食。刘树森认为这样大的一块土质肥沃的地不种粮食，太可惜了。他就开会发动社员在这块地上种高粱，向大家说明种高粱所用的种子、人工不多，即使被水淹了，损失也不大。但是社员不愿种，甚至有的生产队长也不愿种，怕收成不可靠。后来他就先到第二队去动员；第二队种上两块地以后，他又召开社员大会，用二队已经种上两块地的事实动员其他的队。这时，三队队长张明治说：二队都不怕收成不可靠，我们怕啥？有的社员也说：我们就来试试看。结果全部河边沙地都种上了高粱，不但没有遭水淹，而且生长得很好，估计至少可收高粱四千多斤。社员反映：这才是参加合作社的好处。
    关心社员个人疾苦
    刘树森认为：如果不把社的集体利益和社员的个人利益结合起来，社员的个人利益经常和社的集体利益发生矛盾，社就一定办不好。因此，他非常关心这个问题。今年三月间，社里卖了蒜苔，原决定根据投资、劳动工分借支，多的多借，少的少借。后来了解到有个别社员投资、劳动工分少，但是当前生活困难，于是他就召开社委会研究，改变了原来的决定：生活困难的多借，不困难的少借。这样就帮助个别社员克服了困难。今年八月中秋节前夕，有些社员反映：我们还说吃肉，连称盐的钱都没有。他就同其他社委研究，提前卖了一千六百多斤叶子烟，把钱先借给有困难的社员过节。社员反映：这才真正是为我们服务的好社长。
    刘树森对人口多、劳力少、生活比较困难的社员特别关心。社员杨友恩、张富洪、张明德等，有的缺乏劳力，有的害病，有的是残废。如果按社内调配劳动力的办法，他们就不能保持入社前所做的劳动日，收入要受到影响。刘树森召开社委会研究，决定在不影响生产的原则下，适当多调给他们一些轻、杂活路做，予以照顾。这样就保证了八、九户有困难的社员的收入。培养社员集体主义思想
    刘树森特别注意向全体社员进行集体主义思想教育。他主要是抓住好坏的具体事例，采取表扬和批评的方式进行教育。今年上半年，有个别女社员不经过社内允许就私自去地里摘青胡豆；有的干部本位主义、自私；另一方面，有些社员很关心集体利益，如社员张怀玉、张明宗看到社内的麦子、油菜倒在路上，就自动地扶起来，有什么要做的活路就主动地提出来同生产队长研究。刘树森掌握了这些好坏典型事例以后，就召开社员大会，在会上表扬了劳动好、生产积极、关心集体利益的社员张怀玉、张明宗等，批评了不顾社的集体利益的社员和社干部，并且组织社员展开讨论，社员们都联系实际进行检查，批判了自己不关心集体利益的思想和行为。在分配以后，他又通过总结增产经验，对社员进行合作化优越性的教育。社员们都从亲身体验中认识到加入合作社的好处，因而集体主义思想愈来愈增强了。如社里分给女社员张万华的油菜秆子（作柴烧）上面还有菜子没有打干净，她又打了第二道，打下两斤多菜子送回给社里。这一类的事例在这个社里还有不少。
    任劳任怨，大公无私
    这个社的社员一致反映：刘树森工作积极，大公无私。这个反映是有事实根据的。刘树森有时为了社的工作，整天不回家。到了社内收割粮食和分配的时候，他总是半夜三更同其他社干部到处去检查粮食的储放工作，看有无抛撒、霉烂现象。他妻子的思想很落后，说他只顾社不管家，但是他从不灰心，仍然积极搞社的工作。分粮食，他分的不管好坏都不说一句话。分配玉米秆，别的社员都是分在一个集中的地点，这样好运些；给他分的分散在三个地点，他妻子就在背后抱怨，他却说：这有什么关系，多跑几趟背一下就行了。今年小春分配前，有四十二户新社员种的蒜苔是“谁种谁收”，有三十二户老社员种的蒜苔是和粮食分开分配的，但是在小春分配中，其他社务委员和社员都忘记了从全社总耕地面积中除去每户老社员已经分配了的蒜苔地，就准备开始分配。刘树森自己是老社员，他觉得这样分有问题，他提出：应该把已经分配了的蒜苔地从全社总耕地面积中除去后再分配才合理，不然老社员的土地分红中就有一部分要重复，新社员就要吃亏。这就提醒了大家，又才照他上面说的办法再进行分配，做到了公平合理。
