Construction of Rikaze Nyang Chu River Bridge Begins

The construction of the Rikaze Nyang Chu River Bridge officially began on the 20th. That afternoon, the workers drove the first pile into the riverbed. This is the first bridge for automobiles to be built on the Nyang Chu River, and it is expected to be completed before the flood season next year.

Some of the timber for the construction of the Rikaze Nyang Chu River Bridge was transported from Gengzhang and Bahe on the Kangzang Highway, and other building materials have also been successively transported to the construction site. The Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee and the Rikaze Zangzha of the Tibet Local Government have supplied a large amount of firewood and vegetables to the bridge construction workers, and have sent people to help find timber.

    日喀则年楚河大桥动工修建
    日喀则年楚河大桥在二十日正式动工修建，当天下午，工人们把第一根桥桩打入了河底。这是在年楚河上修建的第一座通行汽车的大桥，预计在明年汛期以前建成。
    修建日喀则年楚河大桥的部分木料是从康藏公路线上的更张、巴河运来的，其他建筑器材也陆续运到了工地。班禅堪布会议厅委员会和西藏地方政府日喀则藏札已经供应给建桥工人大量烧柴和蔬菜，并且派人帮助寻找木料。    （新华社）
