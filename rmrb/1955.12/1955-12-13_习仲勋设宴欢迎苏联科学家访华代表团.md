Xinhua News Agency, December 12th. Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun hosted a banquet in Beijing this evening to welcome the entire Soviet Scientists Visiting Delegation led by Professor Novikov.

Xi Zhongxun delivered a welcome speech at the banquet. First, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, he expressed a warm welcome to the distinguished guests. Xi Zhongxun said: Due to the obstruction of certain countries, China was unable to send representatives to the Geneva International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. In order to further assist China in developing the peaceful use of atomic energy, the Soviet government and people have sent their outstanding scientists to introduce the contents of this conference to the Chinese people and Chinese scientists. This will have a great impact on Chinese scientists learning from world scientists, especially from Soviet scientists, about scientific and technological achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and on the development of China's peaceful use of atomic energy.

The head of the Soviet Scientists Visiting Delegation, Novikov, delivered a reply. He said: We are very happy to meet with our Chinese friends. We will discuss the peaceful uses of atomic energy together and contribute our experience in this area. It is hoped that this meeting will further consolidate the friendly academic cooperation between Chinese and Soviet scientists. Without a doubt, the friendly cooperation between Chinese and Soviet scientists and engineers will achieve significant achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy in the near future. On behalf of all the delegation members, he thanked Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Vice Presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Li Siguang, Zhang Jiafu, Wu Youxun, Secretary-General Chen Kangbai, and the responsible persons from the Ministry of Geology, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Higher Education, Ministry of Health, and the State Construction Commission for their warm reception this evening.

Li Siguang, Vice Mayor of Beijing Wu Han, Vice President of Tsinghua University Liu Xianzhou, nuclear physicist Zhao Zhongyao, and members of the delegation also spoke at the banquet.

Also attending the banquet were Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council Yang Fangzhi, nuclear physicist Wang Ganchang, geologist Hou Defeng, physicists Zhou Peiyuan and Qian Weichang, medical scientists Shen Qizhen and Bai Xiqing, agronomist Chen Fengtong, and more than fifty other people.
