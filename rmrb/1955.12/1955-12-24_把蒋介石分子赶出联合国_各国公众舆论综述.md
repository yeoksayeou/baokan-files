Drive the Chiang Kai-shek Clique Out of the United Nations
— A Summary of Public Opinion from Various Countries

Soviet Newspapers
　　"Pravda," "Izvestia," and "Trud" published articles on the 22nd demanding the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the United Nations and the restoration of all the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

　　An article by Nikolayev in "Pravda" stated that it is absolutely intolerable that the United Nations does not have a representative of the People's Republic of China, which undermines the prestige of the United Nations and seriously hinders it from effectively carrying out its work. Asian countries such as India and Burma firmly demand the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. In Africa, the Near East, and Latin America, the demand for expelling the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the United Nations and restoring the rights of the Chinese people has also strengthened. Even in Europe and the United States, many newspapers and periodicals have had to recognize the necessity of solving this problem. Life itself, the interests of enhancing the prestige and effectiveness of the United Nations, and the interests of consolidating peace and security in Asia and the world all require a prompt solution to this problem.

Mongolian Peace Committee
　　The Peace Committee of the Mongolian People's Republic recently held an expanded plenary meeting in Ulaanbaatar. The meeting heard a report by Zagd, the Secretary-General of the Committee, on the results of the United Nations discussion on the admission of new member states. The reporter and subsequent speakers unanimously pointed out that the admission of sixteen new countries to the United Nations is a matter of great international significance. Participants in the plenary meeting adopted a letter to Asian and world countries, calling for the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the United Nations.

Canadian Labour Congress
　　The Canadian Labour Congress, with 400,000 members, presented a memorandum to the Canadian government requesting that the Canadian government recommend that the real government of China obtain a seat in the United Nations, and that this seat should not be occupied by the remnants of the Kuomintang.

Indian Newspapers
　　The Indian "National Herald" editorialized on the 16th, praising the Soviet Union's efforts in making the United Nations more representative. The editorial pointed out that after the admission of sixteen countries to the United Nations, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which does not represent anyone, remaining in the United Nations is still a threat hindering the development of this organization. The editorial said, "It has been too long to allow the Kuomintang to blackmail with world peace, and now is the time to remove this roadblock to progress."

　　The Urdu daily "New Century" said on the 17th that allowing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to remain in the United Nations is not only a source of harm to Asian peace, but also a great challenge to the wisdom, democracy, justice, and tolerance of the people of the world. The newspaper said: "The time has come to drive this Kuomintang group out of the United Nations."

Finnish Newspapers
　　The Finnish "Helsingin Sanomat" believes that the Chiang Kai-shek clique can only stay in the United Nations with the support of the United States. The newspaper said: "The Americans are very clear that without their assistance, Formosa could not last even two weeks."

British Newspapers
　　Several influential British newspapers and magazines, in commenting on the admission of new member states to the United Nations, advocated driving the Chiang Kai-shek representatives out of the United Nations.

　　The "Birmingham Post" editorial emphasized that having the Chiang Kai-shek clique on the Security Council "is an obstacle to the activities of the United Nations." The newspaper said: "The Chiang Kai-shek government can no longer attempt to represent China. Undeniably, the United Nations should review the issue of allowing Communist China to enter the United Nations."

　　Alistair Cooke, the "Manchester Guardian's" correspondent in New York, said that the representatives of Latin American countries have also shown that they cannot tolerate it any longer. The majority of the member states of the United Nations believe that allowing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to remain in the United Nations "is absurd."

　　The "Times" correspondent at the United Nations said: Recent events have made the issue of Chinese representation even more acute. The general sentiment is in favor of expelling the Chiang Kai-shek representatives and admitting China as soon as possible.

    把蒋介石分子赶出联合国
    ——各国公众舆论综述
    苏联报纸
      “真理报”、“消息报”和“劳动报”二十二日发表文章，要求驱逐蒋介石分子出联合国，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。
    “真理报”发表尼古拉耶夫所写的一篇文章说：联合国还没有中华人民共和国的代表是绝不可容忍的事情，这破坏了联合国的威信，并且严重地妨碍了它有效地进行工作。印度、缅甸等亚洲国家都坚决要求恢复中国在联合国中的合法权利。在非洲、近东和拉丁美洲，驱逐蒋介石分子出联合国，恢复中国人民的权利的要求也加强了。就是在欧洲和美国也有许多报刊不得不承认解决这个问题的必要性。生活本身，提高联合国威信和效能的利益，以及巩固亚洲和世界和平与安全的利益，都要求必需迅速解决这一个问题。
    蒙古保卫和平委员会
    蒙古人民共和国保卫和平委员会最近在乌兰巴托举行了扩大全体会议。会议听取了委员会总书记扎格德关于联合国讨论接纳新会员国问题结果的报告。报告人和后来发言的人一致指出，接纳十六个新的国家为联合国会员国是具有巨大国际意义的一件事。全体会议参加者通过一项致亚洲和世界各国书，呼吁把蒋介石分子逐出联合国。
    加拿大劳工大会
    有四十万会员的加拿大劳工大会给加拿大政府一份备忘录，其中要求加拿大政府建议使真正的中国政府在联合国中取得席位，而不应该由国民党残余来占有这个席位。
    印度报纸
    印度“国民先驱报”十六日社论对苏联在使联合国更具有代表性的问题上所作的努力表示赞扬。社论指出，在接纳十六个国家加入联合国以后，并不代表任何人的蒋介石分子留在联合国仍然是阻挠这个组织的发展的威胁。社论说，“听任国民党以世界和平来进行勒索已经太久了，现在是消除这个阻挠进展的路障的时候了。”
    乌尔都文日报“新世纪报”十七日说：让蒋介石分子留在联合国不仅是危害亚洲和平的一个根源，而且是对世界人民的智慧、民主、正义和容忍的巨大挑战。这家报纸说：“把这个国民党集团赶出联合国的时候已经到来了。”
    芬兰报纸
    芬兰“赫尔辛基新闻”认为蒋介石分子只是仗着美国的支持才得以留在联合国中。这家报纸说：“美国人很清楚，如果没有他们的援助，福摩萨连两个星期都维持不了。”
    英国报纸
    英国若干有影响的报纸和杂志在评论联合国接纳新会员国问题时，主张把蒋介石代表赶出联合国去。
    “伯明翰邮报”的社论强调指出，安全理事会中有蒋介石分子“是联合国活动的障碍”。这家报纸说：“蒋介石政府不能再妄图代表中国。无可争辩，联合国应该审查让共产党中国进入联合国的问题了。”
    “曼彻斯特卫报”驻纽约的记者阿利斯特尔·库克说，拉丁美洲国家代表也表现出不能忍受了。联合国大多数会员国都认为，让蒋介石分子留在联合国“是荒谬的”。
    “泰晤士报”驻联合国记者说：最近的事态使中国代表权问题更加尖锐了。一般的情绪是赞成早日把蒋介石代表驱逐出去，接纳中国。
