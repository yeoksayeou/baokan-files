Tractors Give Farmers a Glimpse of a Bright Future

I Want to Truly Become an "Old Age Red"
Editor Comrades:
    I am an old farmer in my seventies, and I want to tell you about my joyful mood and my determination to take the socialist road!
    I started working as a hired hand for landlords at the age of fifteen, and didn't get married until I was fifty-two. Two years later, I had a child. That's why the villagers nicknamed me "Old Age Red." But in the old society, could the lives of poor farmers really be "red"? To be honest, my wife and child became a heavy burden for me. I worked myself to the bone for the landlord all day long, but my family of three still didn't have enough to eat or wear.
    After liberation, I stood up. After the land reform, I was given land. In 1953, the village established an agricultural production cooperative, and I joined it. In the first year of joining the cooperative, I harvested four more shi of grain than when I was farming on my own. At this time, I was still half-believing and half-doubting socialism. I still looked at things with an old mindset, always feeling that I was old and should earn more money to leave to my children. Therefore, I wasn't too attentive to the work in the cooperative, and instead squeezed in time to tie brooms and sell them every morning.
    Last autumn, we went to the state-run Shuangqiao Farm to visit and saw tractors plowing the land with our own eyes. At that moment, I saw the direction of socialist agriculture. But then I thought, who knows when our agricultural cooperative will be able to use tractors? Unexpectedly, this spring our cooperative and several neighboring cooperatives jointly decided to cultivate a piece of thin sandy land nearby. Speaking of this thin sandy land, I remembered an old incident! Fifteen years ago, I rented a few mu of land from the landlord on this land. Who knew that there was a major flood in the first year, and the land was silted up into a sandy beach. I didn't harvest a single grain, but instead lost the rent and fell into debt. Since then, no one has set foot on this land for fifteen years. But this time, the state-run farm sent tractors to help us reclaim the wasteland. The tractors plowed back and forth, seven or eight cun deep, turning over the black, oily soil, breaking the roots of the weeds, and exposing the bottom of the thin sand. This scene made me so happy that I shed tears!
    Because we had tractors to help us reclaim the wasteland, our cooperative saved a lot of manpower this spring to repair dikes, plant trees, and engage in sideline occupations. The peanuts planted by the cooperative on this land also yielded a great harvest in the autumn.
From the tractor helping to reclaim the wasteland, I saw the future of socialism and realized that joining the cooperative is taking the road of socialism. I want to treat the agricultural cooperative as my own home, work hard to run the cooperative well, and walk to socialist society together with the members, truly becoming an "Old Age Red"!

Automatically Remove Boundary Stones from the Fields
Editor Comrades:
    On November 11th, a tractor from the Gaocun Machine耕 Team in Tangyin County, Henan Province, came to Nanchenwang Village to help the agricultural production cooperative with winter plowing. The whole village was encouraged by this event. They saw the tractor running back and forth in the fields with three large plows, plowing quickly and straight, plowing deep and fine, and their enthusiasm for taking the cooperative road was further enhanced.
    Nanchenwang Village is a famous cotton-producing village. The whole village has three agricultural cooperatives, and 279 households have joined the cooperatives, accounting for more than 81% of the total number of households in the village. Chairman Mao's report on the question of agricultural cooperation made the farmers see the road ahead clearly, and the arrival of the tractor became a huge driving force. Last year, the Huoxing Agricultural Cooperative asked its members to remove the boundary stones in order not to hinder耕. However, people did not accept it; although some people removed the boundary stones, they dug a very deep hole in the field boundary and threw in some lime as a mark. This year the situation is different. After the社务 Committee put forward the request to remove the boundary stones again, the members automatically dug up all the boundary stones in one day. Qiao Wenxi dug out a boundary stone buried underground by his ancestors and said to the社长: "This is a stumbling block to socialism, how can it work without digging it up!"
    Tractors have also further increased the enthusiasm for production of farmers in Nanchenwang Village. The Huoxing Agricultural Cooperative plans to expand the cotton fields to 2,000 mu next year according to the national plan; of which 1,000 mu should achieve large-scale high yield, with a yield of 350 jin to 400 jin per mu.

Yin Shixue Will Definitely Have a Bumper Harvest Next Year
Editor Comrades:
    The Xizhanggeng Tractor Station in Jieyu County decided to cultivate land on behalf of various agricultural cooperatives in Yaojiazhuo Township, Anyi County. This news made the farmers in Yaojiazhuo Township grin from ear to ear. The tractor started耕 on November 14th. For several days in a row, there was no time when there were no people on the地头. Zhou Zhimian, from Daqu Village, is over seventy years old and has difficulty walking, but he still followed the tractor back and forth four or five times, grabbing a handful of soil to look at, and measuring the depth of the plowing with a stick. In the end, he was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth and said, "This thing耕地 is two or three cun deeper than that old plow. An cun deeper in the land is better than adding a cart of manure, and we will definitely have a bumper harvest next year!" Old man Xi Changqing watched for several days in a row, and finally said: "Socialism is getting faster and faster. I, an old man, will also live in socialism!"
    With the arrival of the tractor, the farmers' enthusiasm for production and their determination to take the socialist road have become even greater. More and more people are signing up to join the cooperative, and now the number of households joining the cooperative in the whole township has accounted for more than 82% of the total number of households. In addition to the more than 800 mu of land cultivated by tractors, the remaining small pieces of land that cannot be cultivated by tractors have all been deeply耕 according to the plan. Shao Guangfu

Good Rain Turned Wasteland into Fertile Land
Editor Comrades:
    Nongchang Township in Changde County, Hunan Province, has a boundless wasteland洲, covered with thick reeds and weeds. This is the fertile land that has been transformed from lake fields after the renovation of West Dongting Lake. In October this year, the Fugeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nongchang Township planned to reclaim 300 mu of wasteland here to plant rapeseed and wheat, but it was estimated that it would take more than two months even if all the labor force of the whole cooperative was used. Seeing that the sowing season for rapeseed and wheat had arrived, what should be done? Just when everyone was worried, good news came: The state-run West Dongting Farm decided to help them reclaim the wasteland with tractors!
    The day the tractors helped to reclaim the wasteland, the whole township was sensational, and nearby farmers also came to visit. The worker brothers drove the "iron bull" and drove back and forth quickly, and the tight and solid wasteland was immediately turned over row by row, turning into a soft black soil. On this day, a tractor reclaimed a total of more than 80 mu of wasteland. 社员 Pan Futing calculated the account and said: "More than 500 people would grind their hands to bleed, and they would not be able to reclaim 80 mu of wasteland in a day. Tractors are really not simple!" Some farmers specially measured the depth of the tractor's plowing, and the result was very satisfactory, saying: "Good! Good! At least seven cun deep, even the best cattle can't plow so deep." This tractor helped the Fugeng Agricultural Production Cooperative reclaim more than 310 mu of wasteland in four days, and used a disc harrow to harrow the wasteland finely.
    After seeing the tractors耕地, the farmers were determined to support the country's industrial construction, so that the country could produce more tractors in the future to help them耕地. The five agricultural production cooperatives in Nongchang Township are all preparing to sell the best grain to the country, and the 68 mutual aid groups in the whole township have also expressed that they will complete the grain delivery task ahead of schedule. Some mutual aid groups have also written applications requesting to be converted into agricultural production cooperatives.

    拖拉机使农民看到了美好的明天
    我要真正成个“老来红”编辑同志：
    我是一个七十多岁的老农民，我要向你们叙一叙我的欢乐心情和走社会主义道路的决心！
    我从十五岁起就给地主当长工，到五十二岁才结婚，两年以后有了孩子。因此村里的人给我起了个外号叫“老来红”。但是在旧社会里，贫困农民的日子还能过得“红”吗？说实话，老婆、孩子成了我沉重的负担。我一个人整天累死累活地给地主干活，一家三口还是少吃没穿的。
    解放了，我翻了身。经过土地改革，我分到了土地。一九五三年村里成立了农业生产合作社，我也参加了。在入社头一年，我比单干的时候多收了四石粮食。这时候，我对社会主义还是半信半疑的。我还是用老脑筋看事情，总觉得自己年纪大了，应该多挣下点钱留给孩子。因此，我对社里的活不太上心，每天早起却挤时间绑笤帚卖。
    去年秋天，我们到国营双桥农场去参观，亲眼看见了拖拉机犁地。这一下，我看到了社会主义农业的方向。可是又一想，谁知道我们农业社要到什么时候才能使上拖拉机呢？没想到，今年春天我们社和邻村几个社共同决定要把附近一片薄沙地开垦出来耕种。提起这块薄沙地我就想起了旧事！十五年前，我在这片土地上向地主租了几亩地，谁知道头一年遭到大水，土地被淤成了沙滩，我一粒粮没有收，反倒赔上了地租欠下了账。从此以后十五年来，这块地上就没有人踏过。但是这次，国营农场派来了拖拉机帮助我们开荒。拖拉机开来开去一犁七、八寸深，黑油油的土地翻了身，荒草断了根，薄沙见了底。这情景，使我高兴得都流出眼泪来了！
    因为有了拖拉机帮助开荒，今年春天我们社里省出了不少人力来修堤、栽树、搞副业。社里在这块地上种的花生，秋后也得到了大丰收。
  从拖拉机帮助开荒这件事里，我看到了社会主义的前途，认识了入社就是走社会主义的路。我要把农业社当作自己的家，努力把社办好，同社员们一起走到社会主义社会，真正成个“老来红”！

    自动刨掉地里的界石编辑同志：
    十一月十一日，河南省汤阴县高村机耕队的一台拖拉机到南陈王村帮助农业生产合作社冬耕。全村的人都为这件事情所鼓舞。他们看到了拖拉机带着三张大犁在地里来回奔驰，耕得又快又直，犁得又深又细，走合作化道路的热情更加提高了。
    南陈王村是一个有名的产棉村，全村有三个农业社，入社农民已经有二百七十九户，占全村总户数的百分之八十一以上。毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告使农民看清了前进的道路，拖拉机的到来又成为一个巨大的推动力量。去年，火星农业社为了不妨碍耕地，曾要求社员拔界石。但是，人们并没有接受；有些人虽然把界石拔掉了，但是在田界上扎个很深的窟窿，丢进一些石灰作为记号。今年情况就不同了。当社务委员会再次提出了拔界石的要求以后，在一天的时间内，社员们就自动把界石刨了个一干二净。乔文喜把祖祖辈辈留下来的一块埋在地下的界石刨了出来，他对社长说：“这是社会主义的绊脚石，不刨掉它还能行！”
    拖拉机还使南陈王村的农民更加提高了生产积极性。火星农业社计划明年按照国家计划把棉田扩大到二千亩；其中一千亩要做到大面积丰产，每亩产量达到三百五十斤到四百斤。
    殷时学明年一定丰收编辑同志：
    解虞县西张耿拖拉机站决定给安邑县姚家卓乡各农业社代耕土地，这个消息使姚家卓乡的农民们乐得眉开眼笑。十一月十四日拖拉机开始耕地了。连着几天地头上没有一会断过人。大渠村周芝勉已经七十多岁了，走路都不方便，还跟在拖拉机后面跑了四、五个来回，一会儿抓把土看看，一会儿用棍子量量犁地的深浅。最后他喜欢得嘴都合不住了，说：“这东西犁地比那老翻犁深两三寸。地犁深一寸，胜似多上一车粪，明年一定丰收！”席长青老汉一连看了几天，最后说：“社会主义越来越快了。我老汉还要过上社会主义呢！”
    拖拉机这一来，农民们的生产劲头和走社会主义道路的决心更大了。报名入社的人越来越多，现在全乡入社的农户已经占总农户的百分之八十二以上。全乡除了拖拉机代耕的八百多亩地外，剩下不能用拖拉机耕的小块地，也都全部按计划深耕完毕了。　邵广福
  　好雨荒地变成了良田编辑同志：
    湖南常德县农场乡有一片一望无边的大荒洲，上面长满了很厚的芦苇和杂草。这是修整西洞庭湖以后，由湖田变成的肥沃土地。今年十月间，农场乡富耕农业生产合作社计划在这里开垦三百亩荒地种植油菜和小麦，但是一计算，就是把全社的劳动力都用上还要用两个多月的时间。眼看着油菜和麦子的播种季节已经到了，怎么办呢？正在大家发愁的时候，传来一个好消息：国营西洞庭农场决定帮助他们用拖拉机开荒！
    拖拉机帮助开荒的那一天，全乡的人都轰动起来了，附近的农民也都赶来参观。工人兄弟驾驶着
  “铁牛”，飞快地驶来驶去，又紧又实的荒地马上一行一行地被翻起来，变成了一片松软的黑土。这一天，一台拖拉机共开垦了八十多亩荒地。社员潘福廷算了一下账说：“五百多人把手磨出血来，一天也开垦不出八十亩荒地，拖拉机真不简单！”有的农民特地去量了拖拉机犁地的深度，结果很满意地说：“好！好！起码有七寸深，就是最好的牛也犁不到这样深。”这台拖拉机在四天内帮助富耕农业生产合作社开垦了三百一十多亩荒地，并且用圆盘耙把荒地耙得又细又碎。
    农民们看了拖拉机耕地以后，都决心支援国家工业建设，让国家将来生产出更多的拖拉机来帮助自己耕地。农场乡五个农业生产合作社都准备把最好的谷子卖给国家，全乡六十八个互助组也表示要提前完成交粮任务。有的互助组并且写了申请书要求转为农业生产合作社。
