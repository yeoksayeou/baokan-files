Xinhua News Agency, New York dispatch from TASS – The Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the situation of residents of Indian descent in the Union of South Africa on December 8th and 9th.

    The Indian representative pointed out in his speech that the government of the Union of South Africa, in violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, has consistently formulated its policies based on the concept of one race being superior to another. The government of the Union of South Africa implements racial segregation not only against residents of Indian descent, but also against the majority of the people within the Union. The South African government has disregarded the resolutions repeatedly adopted by the United Nations on this issue and refused to conduct direct negotiations with the governments of India and Pakistan to resolve the problem. The Indian representative pointed out that the struggle of people around the world against racial discrimination is escalating.

    Representatives of most countries emphasized in their speeches that the United Nations should condemn the racial discrimination policies implemented by the government of the Union of South Africa.

    Soviet representative Zarubin said that the United Nations General Assembly should continue to seek a solution to this problem by all means.

    The representatives of the United States and Brazil attempted to defend the policies of the government of the Union of South Africa and suggested that the issue should not be further discussed within the United Nations. The representative of Saudi Arabia refuted this opinion in his speech. Representatives of many countries pointed out that the first step in resolving this problem at present should be direct negotiations between the parties concerned.

    Finally, the Special Political Committee passed a resolution that once again recommends that the parties concerned (the Union of South Africa, India, and Pakistan) conduct negotiations to reach an agreement, and report to the United Nations General Assembly if necessary.

    联大特别政委会
    就南非境内种族歧视问题通过决议
    新华社据塔斯社纽约消息　联合国大会特别政治委员会在十二月八日和九日讨论了南非联邦里印度血统居民的处境问题。
    印度代表发言指出，南非联邦政府违反联合国宪章的基本原则，一直根据一个种族比另一个种族优越的概念制定他们的政策。南非联邦政府不仅对印度血统居民，而且还对联邦内的大多数人民实行种族隔离。南非政府不尊重联合国就这个问题一再通过的决议，拒绝同印度和巴基斯坦政府进行直接谈判来解决这个问题。印度代表指出，全世界人民反对种族歧视的斗争正越来越高涨。
    大多数国家代表在发言中都强调指出，联合国应当谴责南非联邦政府所执行的种族歧视政策。
    苏联代表查鲁宾说，联合国大会应该以一切办法继续谋求解决这个问题。
    美国和巴西代表企图为南非联邦政府的政策辩护，并且建议不要在联合国中进一步讨论这个问题。沙特阿拉伯代表发言驳斥了这种意见。许多国家代表指出，目前解决这个问题的第一步应当是有关方面的直接谈判。
    最后，特别政治委员会通过一项决议，再次建议有关方面（南非联邦、印度和巴基斯坦）为达成协议而进行谈判，如果必要的话向联合国大会提出报告。
