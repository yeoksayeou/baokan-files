The twelve coal mining sections of the Ping'an Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau are all organizing regular cyclic operations, but only a few coal mining sections can truly achieve regular cyclic operations and comprehensively complete the state plan each month. In the first half of this year, eight coal mining sections in the entire mine organized regular cyclic operations, producing more than 6,000 tons of coal and reducing costs by more than 30,000 yuan. However, in reality, only three sections comprehensively completed the state plan relatively well. The remaining five sections did not achieve regular cyclic operations; they were either under-producing or had insufficient cycle rates. The achievements of the coal mining sections that organized regular cyclic operations relatively well were also not consolidated. Once the work site moved or natural conditions changed, regular cycles would be disrupted. Although the cumulative output of the entire mine from January to September this year exceeded the state plan, the state's required increased production plan was not completed, and costs were also overspent.

What is the reason for this?

First of all, the advanced experience of organizing regular cyclic operations in one-meter-thick coal seam work sites has not yet been truly mastered by the cadres and workers of the entire mine.

After the birth of an advanced experience, enterprise leaders need to carefully organize cadres and workers throughout the mine to learn this advanced experience, understand the essence and main content of this advanced experience, and make this advanced experience their own. This is the ideological and mass foundation for promoting advanced experience. When Ping'an Mine promoted the advanced experience of organizing regular cyclic operations in one-meter-thick coal seam work sites, it did a lot of work in this area, but judging from the results, it was still not enough. It is very common for grassroots cadres and workers to be unfamiliar with the technical operating procedures of coal mining work sites and the ten systems of regular cyclic operations. Some deputy section chiefs of coal mining sections have not even clarified the basic requirements of regular cyclic operations. Under such circumstances, how can regular cyclic operations be universally realized!

There are also many cadres and workers who are not unfamiliar but have not ideologically accepted this advanced experience and have adopted a perfunctory attitude towards promoting this advanced experience. For example, the education, examination, signing, and stamping system for implementing technical operating procedures is an important measure to ensure that technical operating procedures are implemented among the masses and to arm the masses. However, according to the inspection in March of this year, in the coal mining sections that implemented this system relatively well, the number of signatures only accounted for 70% of the total number of workers on the rolls. In the coal mining sections that did not implement this system well, the number of signatures was less than 15%, and some sections did not implement the signature system at all.

The cadres and workers of the coal mining section did not accept or master the advanced experience of organizing regular cyclic operations in one-meter-thick coal seam work sites, which directly affected the realization of regular cyclic operations. However, the impact was only limited to one coal mining section. If the mine's cadres did not accept or master the advanced experience of organizing regular cyclic operations in one-meter-thick coal seam work sites, the impact would be related to the entire mine. The work of Ping'an Mine in this area is not satisfactory. Take the technical section as an example. The technical section is now responsible for compiling the technical operating procedures for each coal mining work site in the entire mine. According to the inspection in March of this year, six of the eleven coal mining work sites' technical operating procedures in the entire mine at that time were inconsistent with the actual situation. How do the comrades in the technical section view this issue? They emphasized the lack of geological data more, and the limited geological data was often unreliable. These are undoubtedly facts; however, these are not insurmountable difficulties. In the past, the geological data of the one-meter-thick coal seam work site was also insufficient and unreliable, but they had a very good experience: investigation and research. And this is precisely what the technical section has not done now, so it cannot make the technical operating procedures practical and play a guiding role in production.

Secondly, the realization of regular cyclic operations has not yet become a common goal for the entire mine, and the coal mining sections are often in a situation of fighting alone.

Modern industry is an integrated whole with closely linked links. If the advanced experience of any link has a decisive significance for the entire enterprise, then it will inevitably involve other links, requiring corresponding improvements in the work of other links. When promoting this advanced experience, enterprise leaders must pay close attention to the development of the work of each link and remove obstacles to the promotion of advanced experience. When Ping'an Mine promoted the advanced experience of organizing regular cyclic operations in one-meter-thick coal seam work sites, although it reformed the organizational structure and emphasized being oriented towards production and the grassroots, it removed some organizational and ideological obstacles to the promotion of this advanced experience, but the transformation of ideological style was still far from enough, and the mine's organizational work in this area was still very weak. The comrades in the various auxiliary departments still regard regular cyclic operations as the business of the coal mining sections, and therefore do not do enough to face the grassroots and solve the problems of realizing regular cyclic operations in the grassroots, so that many problems in the coal mining sections cannot be solved in time.

The first coal mining section is a very obvious example. The first coal mining section is a coal mining section that has consistently realized regular cyclic operations in one-meter-thick coal seam work sites and created a set of experience in organizing regular cyclic operations. Now coal mines across the country are learning from their experience, but they themselves have fallen far behind. This advanced coal mining section lost the red flag of excellence in the work evaluation in the second quarter of this year, and then plummeted. In the monthly evaluation, it was the second to last in July, and even fell to the last place in August.

Huang Jinyou, the section chief of the first coal mining section, explained, "The conditions are bad!" Some comrades in the mine also said, "The conditions of the first coal mining section are bad."

Indeed, the natural conditions of the two coal mining work sites where the first coal mining section has recently worked are not good. One coal mining work site has a lot of dripping water. After finally finishing mining, when changing to another coal mining work site, it encountered a false roof. If you are not careful when blasting, the roof will collapse with it, and large pieces of stones lie across this very short and thin coal seam working face, which is simply impossible to handle. It is difficult to achieve regular cyclic operations under such natural conditions, but it is by no means impossible; the problem is that the technical operating procedures of these two coal mining work sites did not propose effective measures to address these difficult natural conditions, and the mine's leadership did not promptly study and help the first coal mining section solve the difficulties in production, making the first coal mining section helpless in the face of natural obstacles. In July, dripping water ruined the honor of the first coal mining section, and in August, dripping water still caused the first coal mining section to fall far behind.

The mine's inability to quickly help the coal mining section solve the problems in organizing regular cyclic operations is related to the fact that the new organizational structure has not yet been able to work very skillfully after the production reform, but the main reason is still the problem of understanding. Various departments in the mine often only see that they are departments, large or small, with a group of people and a pile of things, and they consider problems from this small scope, but they rarely consider their work from the perspective of the entire mine's production, from the needs of the coal mining section—the place where coal is produced. For example, the geological department is most interested in compiling the mine's geological report, which is certainly a very important task, but they therefore gave up making greater efforts to provide more and more reliable geological data for the technical operating procedures of the current coal mining work sites. Some comrades even believe that this work should be considered next year, which is completely wrong. The electromechanical department is also like this. They work very hard, maintain the four major machines such as water pumps very well, and pay great attention to saving. The expenditure on electromechanical equipment in August was only more than 5,000 yuan, which was reduced by half compared with the past. However, they are very indifferent to the four small machines such as coal conveyors in the well. Coal conveyors often break down, causing production to be intermittent. From January to August this year, a total of more than 1,300 electromechanical failures occurred in the entire mine, cumulatively affecting production for more than 2,700 hours. The comrades in the electromechanical department believe that this is the business of the coal mining section, forgetting that they have not fulfilled their responsibility to check and supervise.

Thirdly, there is a varying degree of complacency among the leaders of Ping'an Mine, from the mine's leadership down to the grassroots cadres. Its main manifestation is seeing more achievements and fewer shortcomings in the work; seeing more objective difficulties and less subjective inspection and improvement when seeing shortcomings. The mine's leaders and staff always emphasize that "the front has been spread very widely at once" and "the new organization cannot conduct work skillfully after the production reform," using these as explanations for the poor promotion of the advanced experience of organizing regular cyclic operations in one-meter-thick coal seam work sites. In fact, the comprehensive promotion of this advanced experience did not just begin now, and the new organizational structure has also been established for more than nine months. Why is there always no significant improvement? This is precisely inseparable from their emphasis on objective reasons and lack of arduous efforts from a subjective point of view.

It is precisely because this complacency hinders the progress of the work that a slack phenomenon arises. Taking the first coal mining section as an example, the spirit of working hard and conscientiously and trying every means to achieve regular cyclic operations is far less than before.

Promoting correct and advanced ideas and criticizing erroneous and backward ideas is the key to whether Ping'an Mine can well promote and consolidate the advanced experience of organizing regular cyclic operations in one-meter-thick coal seam work sites, and it is an important task of the Ping'an Mine Party organization. However, the work of the Ping'an Mine Party organization in this area is relatively weak, and the Party's supervisory and guarantee role in enterprise production has not been well played.

Since September, Ping'an Mine's work has improved somewhat, and the thinking of the entire mine has begun to unify, confirming that organizing regular cyclic operations is the key to the entire mine completing the state plan and increasing production and saving. The mine's cadres have also begun to focus on helping the coal mining section organize regular cyclic operations. With the specific help of the mine, the work of the first coal mining section has improved greatly in September. They comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan, and continued to maintain a stable state in October. The third coal mining section, which collapsed in September, also improved in October. Among the twelve coal mining sections in the entire mine, five coal mining sections realized regular cyclic operations in September. Since October, the entire mine has overfulfilled its tasks every day, and the cycle rate has averaged more than 80%.

Naturally, the improvement in production since September is only a beginning. To fundamentally change the situation that the advanced experience of organizing regular cyclic operations in one-meter-thick coal seam work sites has not been well promoted and cannot be consolidated, we must still rely on the long-term unremitting efforts of all cadres and employees of Ping'an Mine, especially the mine's leaders and staff in the future.

    平安矿为什么不能全矿实现正规循环作业
    本报记者　范荣康
    阜新矿务局平安矿十二个采煤段都在组织正规循环作业，但每个月真能走上正规循环作业比较好地全面完成国家计划的采煤段只是少数。今年上半年，全矿有八个采煤段组织正规循环作业，共多产了六千多吨煤，降低成本三万多元；可是，实际上比较好地全面完成国家计划的，只有三个段，其余五个段并没有实现正规循环作业，不是欠产，就是循环率不足。正规循环作业组织得比较好的采煤段的成绩也是不巩固的。一到场子搬家或自然条件发生变化，正规循环就乱了。今年一至九月全矿累计的产量虽然超过了国家计划，但是国家要求的增产计划并没有完成，成本也超支了。
    这是什么原因呢？
    首先是一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验还没有真正被全矿的干部和工人所掌握。
    当一个先进经验诞生之后，就需要企业领导者认真组织全矿干部和工人学习这个先进经验，领会这个先进经验的实质及其主要内容，使这个先进经验成为他们自己的东西。这是推广先进经验的思想基础和群众基础。平安矿推广一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验的时候，在这方面做了不少工作，但是从效果上来检查，还是做得很不够的。基层干部和工人不熟悉采煤场子的技术作业规程，不熟悉正规循环作业的十大制度是很普遍的现象，甚至有些采煤段的副段长还没有弄清楚正规循环作业的基本要求。在这种情况下，怎么可能普遍实现正规循环作业呢！
    还有许多干部和工人不是不熟悉而是没有从思想上接受这个先进经验，对推行这个先进经验采取了应付的态度。例如执行技术作业规程的教育、考试和签名盖章制度是保证把技术作业规程贯彻到群众中去、武装群众的重要措施，但是据今年三月的检查，执行这个制度比较好的采煤段，签名人数只占在籍工人总数的百分之七十，执行这个制度不好的采煤段签名人数不足百分之十五，甚至有的段根本不执行签名制度。
    采煤段的干部和工人没有接受、没有掌握一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验，直接影响了正规循环作业的实现，可是影响所及毕竟只是一个采煤段；而矿上的干部没有接受、没有掌握一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验，其影响所及就关系全矿了。平安矿在这方面的工作恰恰是不能令人满意的。拿技术科来说，技术科现在负责编制全矿各个采煤场子的技术作业规程。据今年三月的检查，当时全矿十一个采煤场子的技术作业规程中，有六个是同实际情况不符的。技术科的同志怎样来认识这个问题呢？他们强调得比较多的，还是地质资料不足，仅有的地质资料也常常不可靠。这些无疑都是事实；可是，这些也不是什么不可克服的困难。过去，一公尺层采煤场子的地质资料也是不足、不可靠的，但是他们有一条很好的经验：调查研究。而这正是技术科现在所没有做到的，因而不能使技术作业规程切合实际，发挥指导生产的作用。
    其次是因为实现正规循环作业还没有成为全矿共同的奋斗目标，采煤段常处在孤军奋斗情况中。
    现代工业是一个各个环节紧相联系的整体。任何一个环节的先进经验，如果对整个企业具有决定性的意义，那末，它必然涉及其他各个环节，要求其他各个环节的工作有相应的改进。在推广这个先进经验的时候，企业的领导者就必须十分注意各个环节工作的发展，替先进经验的推广扫除障碍。平安矿在推广一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业先进经验的时候，虽然改革了组织机构，强调了面向生产、面向基层，替这个先进经验的推广扫除了
  一些组织上的和思想上的障碍，但是思想作风上的转变还是很不够的，矿上在这方面的组织工作还是很薄弱的。各个辅助部门的同志总还是把正规循环作业看作是采煤段的事，因而面向基层，为基层解决实现正规循环作业中的问题做得不够，使采煤段许多问题不能及时解决。
    第一采煤段就是一个很明显的例子。第一采煤段是在一公尺层采煤场子里始终如一地实现正规循环作业，创造了组织正规循环作业的一套经验的采煤段。现在全国煤矿都在学习他们的经验，而他们自己却远远地落在后面了。这个先进的采煤段在今年第二季度的工作评比中失去了优胜红旗，接着一落千丈，月终评比，七月份是倒数第二名，八月份更退到倒数第一名。
    第一采煤段段长黄金有辩解说：“条件坏呵！”矿上有些同志也说：“第一采煤段的条件是坏。”
    确实，第一采煤段最近工作的两个采煤场子自然条件都不好。一个采煤场子有很大的淋头水，好容易采完了换到另一个采煤场子，又遇到伪顶，放炮稍不小心，顶板就跟着崩下来，大块大块的石头横在这很矮的薄煤层工作面上，简直没法处理。要在这样的自然条件下实现正规循环作业，是有困难的，但是决不是不可能的；问题在于这两个采煤场子的技术作业规程并没有针对这种困难的自然条件提出有效的措施，矿的领导上也没有及时研究和帮助第一采煤段解决生产中的困难，使得第一采煤段在自然条件的障碍面前束手无策。七月份是淋头水断送了第一采煤段的荣誉，八月份还是淋头水使第一采煤段远远地落在后面。
    矿上不能迅速地帮助采煤段解决组织正规循环作业中的问题，是同生产改革后，新的组织机构还没有能很熟练地进行工作有一定的关系的，但是最主要的原因还是认识问题。矿上各个部门往往只看到自己大小是个部门，有一摊子人，有一摊子事情，从这个小范围里来考虑问题的时候多，却很少从全矿的生产，从出煤的地方——采煤段的需要，来考虑自己的工作。例如地质部门最有兴趣的是编制全矿的地质报告书，这当然是一件很重要的工作，可是他们因此放弃了尽更大的努力去为目前各个采煤场子的技术作业规程提供更多的、更可靠的地质资料，有的同志竟认为这个工作应该放到明年再考虑，那是完全错误的。机电部门也是这样，他们工作很努力，水泵等四大机械维护得很好，很注意节约，八月份机电器材方面的支出只五千多元，较过去减少了一半。可是，他们对井下的运煤机等四小机械却很不关心，运煤机经常发生故障，使得生产时断时续，今年一至八月全矿共发生机电故障一千三百多次，累计影响生产二千七百多小时，机电部门的同志却认为这是采煤段的事情，忘记了自己也没有负起检查督促的责任。
    再次是平安矿上自矿的领导下至基层干部都有程度不同的自满情绪。它的主要表现形式是看到工作中的成绩多、缺点少；看到缺点强调客观困难多，从主观上检查改进少。矿的领导工作人员总强调“一下子面铺得很广”、“生产改革后新的机构还不能熟练地进行工作”，用这些来作为解释一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验推广得不好的原因。其实全面推广这个先进经验并不是现在才开始的，新的组织机构也建立九个多月了，为什么总是没有显著的改进呢？这恰恰是和他们强调客观原因，没有从主观上作艰苦的努力分不开的。
    正是因为这种自满情绪障碍了工作的前进，随即产生了松懈的现象。拿第一采煤段来说，那种兢兢业业地艰苦工作，想尽一切办法来实现正规循环作业的劲头，已经大不如从前了。
    发扬正确的、先进的思想，批判错误的、落后的思想，是平安矿能不能很好地推广和巩固一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验的关键，是平安矿党组织的一个重要任务。可是平安矿党组织在这方面的工作是比较薄弱的，党对企业生产的监督和保证作用还没有很好地发挥。
    九月份以来，平安矿的工作有一些改进，全矿的思想开始统一起来，确认组织正规循环作业是全矿完成国家计划和增产节约计划的关键。矿上的干部也开始有重点地去帮助采煤段组织正规循环作业。第一采煤段在矿上的具体帮助下，九月份的工作大有起色，他们全面超额地完成了国家计划，十月份还继续保持稳定的状态。九月份垮了下去的第三采煤段十月份也有好转。全矿十二个采煤段中，九月份有五个采煤段实现了正规循环作业。十月份以来，全矿每天超额完成任务，循环率平均在百分之八十以上。
    自然，九月份以来生产情况的好转，还只是一个开始，要根本改变一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验推广得不好和不能巩固的情况，还必须依靠平安矿全体干部员工，特别是矿的领导工作人员今后长期不懈的努力。
