Anhui Province Prepares to Establish a Large Number of Advanced Cooperatives

Many peasants in Anhui Province are actively requesting the establishment of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives. At present, more than 490 advanced cooperatives have been established throughout the province, and more than 2,000 are being prepared. It is estimated that by next spring, 3,400 advanced cooperatives will be established throughout the province, with peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for more than 15 percent of the total number of households in the province.

The advanced cooperatives that have been established and are being prepared in various parts of Anhui are generally based on old cooperatives, absorbing some mutual aid teams and individual farmers. These cooperatives all have relatively strong leading cadres. For example, the advanced cooperative in Qishibu Township, Feixi County, has more than 500 cadres above the level of committee member of the primary cooperative, including 145 party members, 250 members of the Communist Youth League, and more than 200 activists. These advanced cooperatives are generally established based on natural conditions and the needs of developing production. More than 80 old cooperatives in Wudian District, Fengyang County, jointly established an advanced cooperative of 3,000 households because they had common requirements for water conservancy. After the cooperative is established, it plans to use five mountain streams and three springs to build three small reservoirs, which can irrigate 40,000 mu of farmland in the entire cooperative, and also enable 50,000 mu of barren mountains to be afforested, planted with fruit trees, and developed into pastures.

Various parts of Anhui have assigned experienced cadres to lead the work of establishing advanced cooperatives. For cooperatives with more than 1,000 households, the first and second secretaries of the county party committee personally lead the effort. Before establishing advanced cooperatives this year, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized and introduced the experience of trial-running advanced cooperatives since 1954, and trained a group of cadres for establishing cooperatives.

    安徽省筹建大批高级合作社
    安徽省不少农民积极要求办高级农业生产合作社。目前，全省已经建成的高级社有四百九十多个，正在筹办的有两千多个。预计到明年春天，全省将建立三千四百个高级社，入社农户将占全省总农户的百分之十五以上。
    安徽各地已经建成和正在筹办的高级社，一般都是以老社为基础，吸收部分互助组和个体农民办起来的。这些社都有比较强的领导骨干。如肥西县七十埠乡的高级社，有初级社社委以上的骨干五百多人，其中党员有一百四十五人，团员二百五十人，积极分子二百多人。这些高级社一般也都是根据自然条件和发展生产的需要而建立起来的。凤阳县武店区八十多个老社由于在水利上有共同的要求，联合办了一个三千户的高级社。这个社建成以后，计划利用五条山涧和三个泉眼兴修三个小型水库，可以灌溉全社四万亩农田，还可使五万亩荒山能够育林、种植果树和开辟牧场。
    安徽各地都配备了有经验的干部领导办高级社的工作。千户以上的社，还由县委正、副书记亲自领导。在今年办高级社以前，中共安徽省委曾经总结和介绍了一九五四年以来试办高级社的经验，并且训练了一批办社干部。  （本报驻合肥记者）
