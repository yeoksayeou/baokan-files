    Shanghai, December 24th (By our newspaper) – Seven state-owned and joint state-private factories in Shanghai have pledged to strive to complete the production tasks stipulated in the National First Five-Year Plan in four years. These factories are: Shanghai Turbine Factory, Shanghai Boiler Factory, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory, Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, and the joint state-private Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory No. 5. These pledges were made at the Third Session of the First Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, which is currently being held.

    These factories have all completed their production plans for this year very well. For example, the Shanghai Turbine Factory has already overfulfilled its 1955 production plan and its second half-year production increase and economy plan by ten days; preparations for the 1956 production plan have already begun. The Shanghai Boiler Factory completed its national plan for this year eight days ahead of schedule.

    In order to fulfill the pledge of completing the production tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the vast number of workers in these factories are actively finding ways to improve production efficiency and formulating individual guarantee conditions. More than one hundred workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant have already made guarantees to strive to complete their individual workloads during the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Not long ago, lathe operators Bao Jilong and Lu Liangen at the Shanghai Turbine Factory had a cutting speed of 130 meters per minute, but now they have both increased it to 180 meters per minute. Bai Mengyuan, a worker who processes turbine rotor parts, originally had a cutting speed of 14 meters per minute, but now he has increased it to 80 meters per minute. The total value of this factory's production in 1956 will be approximately equal to the sum of the factory's actual total production value in the first three years of the first Five-Year Plan. The National First Five-Year Plan stipulates their 1956 turbine output (calculated in kilowatts), and they will be able to over fulfill it by 378 percent.

    Chongqing, December 24th (By our newspaper) – All the staff and workers of the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant recently discussed the various targets stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan. All workshops, work sections, and groups have proposed to further improve work efficiency on the basis of mastering new technologies, and strive to complete the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in 1956. Bai Fengchi, a worker and Communist Party member in the metalworking workshop, pledged to complete two years' worth of work in 1956 and also train a level-three technician. Other staff and workers in the metalworking workshop and forging workshop have also made guarantees to complete the workload of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    上海七个工厂和重庆机床厂提出保证
    争取四年完成五年计划规定任务
    本报上海二十四日电　上海市已经有七个国营和公私合营工厂提出保证，争取以四年时间完成国家第一个五年计划规定的生产任务。这些工厂是：国营上海汽轮机厂，国营上海锅炉厂，国营上海第三钢厂，国营上海矿山机器厂，国营上海第二纺织机械厂，国营上海机床厂，公私合营大中华橡胶五厂。他们的这些保证是在正在召开的上海市第一届人民代表大会第三次会议上提出的。
    这些工厂今年的生产计划都完成得很好。如上海汽轮机厂已经提前十天全面超额完成了一九五五年生产计划和下半年的增产节约计划；一九五六年的生产准备工作已经开始进行。上海锅炉厂提前八天全面完成了今年的国家计划。
    为了实现提前完成五年计划规定的生产任务的保证，这些工厂的广大职工正在积极设法提高生产效率，拟订个人的保证条件。上海机床厂现在已经有一百多名工人提出保证，争取提前完成第一个五年计划期间的个人工作量。上海汽轮机厂车工鲍吉龙和陆连根不久以前每分钟的切削速度是一百三十公尺，现在都已提高到一百八十公尺。加工汽轮机主轮机件的工人柏梦元，原来每分钟切削速度是十四公尺，现在提高到八十公尺。这个工厂一九五六年的生产总值，约等于这个厂在第一个五年计划前三年的实际生产总值的总和。国家第一个五年计划规定他们一九五六年的汽轮机产量（以千瓩计算），他们将可以超额完成百分之三百七十八。
    本报重庆二十四日电　重庆机床厂全体职工在最近讨论了第一个五年计划规定的各项指标。各车间、工段、小组都提出要在掌握新技术的基础上，进一步提高工作效率，争取在一九五六年内提前完成第一个五年计划规定的任务。金工车间工人、共产党员柏凤池提出保证，要在一九五六年内做完两年的工作，还要培养出一个三级技术工人。金工车间和锻工车间的其他职工也都提出了提前完成第一个五年计划的工作量的保证。
