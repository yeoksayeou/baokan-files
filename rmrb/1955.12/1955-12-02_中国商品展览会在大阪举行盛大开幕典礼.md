Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, December 1st: The Chinese Commodities Exhibition held a grand opening ceremony in Osaka on the afternoon of November 30th. Over 6,000 people from all walks of life in Osaka and the Kansai region attended the opening ceremony.

    The opening ceremony officially began at 2:00 PM.

    After the ceremony began, Cao Zhongshu, head of the Chinese Commodities Exhibition Delegation, delivered the opening speech. On behalf of all members of the delegation, he expressed gratitude to the people of Osaka and the Kansai region for their assistance to the Chinese Commodities Exhibition. He then said: China and Japan have a long history of economic and trade ties, and are geographically close with convenient exchanges. There are many commodities that can be exchanged between the two countries, which is a valuable foundation for developing bilateral trade. At the same time, the people of both countries also have a common desire to further develop Sino-Japanese trade. In recent years, thanks to the continuous efforts of the Chinese government and people and people from all walks of life in Japan, Sino-Japanese trade has seen some recovery, but due to external artificial obstacles, trade between the two countries has not achieved the development it deserves. The Osaka region has traditional trade relations with China and is one of the main cities for Sino-Japanese trade. Therefore, we are willing to have extensive contact with friends from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about Sino-Japanese trade during the exhibition, and fully exchange opinions to jointly strive for the normalization of Sino-Japanese trade relations.

    Murata Shozo, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Uda Koichi, representative of the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade, Akama Bunzo, Governor of Osaka Prefecture, Nakai Mitsuji, Mayor of Osaka City, Ume Moto, Speaker of the Osaka Prefectural Assembly, Matsuo Teiichiro, Speaker of the Osaka City Council, Kanno Wataro, representative of the Liberal Democratic Party, Hoashi Kei, representative of the Socialist Party, and Sudo Goro, representative of the Communist Party, delivered speeches successively. They all expressed the hope that this exhibition would help restore Japan-China trade and promote friendly relations between Japan and China.

    Finally, Osaka Prefectural Governor Akama Bunzo cut the ribbon. At this moment, hundreds of peace doves and countless colorful balloons flew into the sky. Representatives from all walks of life and social celebrities in Kansai, accompanied by Cao Zhongshu, head of the Chinese Commodities Exhibition Delegation, and deputy heads Feng Tiecheng and Xiao Xiangqian, entered the exhibition hall for a tour.

    中国商品展览会在大阪举行盛大开幕典礼
    据新华社大阪一日电　中国商品展览会十一月三十日下午在大阪举行了盛大的开幕典礼。参加开幕典礼的有大阪和关西地区各界人士共六千多人。
    开幕典礼在下午二时正式开始。
    典礼开始后，中国商品展览团团长曹中枢首先致开幕词。他代表全团人员对大阪和关西各界人民对中国商品展览会所给予的协助表示感谢。他接着说：中日两国有悠久的经济贸易联系，并且地理接近，往来便利，相互可交换的商品很多，这本是发展两国贸易的可贵基础。同时两国人民也有进一步发展中日贸易的共同愿望。几年来，由于中国政府和人民与日本各界人士的不断努力，中日贸易虽然有了一定的恢复，但是由于外来的人为障碍，两国贸易仍未得到应有的发展。大阪地区与中国有着传统的贸易关系，是进行中日贸易的主要城市之一。因此，我们愿意在展出期间和热心于中日贸易的各界朋友们进行广泛接触，并且充分交换意见，为促进中日贸易关系的正常化而共同努力。
    日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表宇田耕一、大阪府知事赤间文三、大阪市市长中井光次、大阪府议会议长梅本敬一、大阪市议会议长松尾祯一郎、自由民主党代表菅野和太郎、社会党代表帆足计、共产党代表须藤五郎先后致词。他们一致表示希望这次展览会将有助于恢复日中贸易和促进日中友好关系。
    最后，由大阪府知事赤间文三剪彩。这时，数百只和平鸽和无数各色的小气球飞向天空。关西各界代表和社会名流在中国商品展览团团长曹中枢和副团长冯铁城、萧向前等陪同下入场参观。
