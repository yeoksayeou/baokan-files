Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 26th (Dispatch): A message from Laos reports that the one-sided elections organized by the Royal Lao Government were held on December 25th.

The Laotian Fighting Units have repeatedly expressed their opposition to the Royal Lao Government's holding of one-sided elections. Four days before this one-sided election was held, on December 21st, the Laotian political delegation wrote to the Chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos, protesting against the actions of the Royal Lao authorities. The letter pointed out that this one-sided election is contrary to the Geneva Accords, and that the Laotian Fighting Units and former resistance personnel should be allowed to participate in the general election.

The letter also demanded that the Lao Royal side cease all its military activities, stop its armed attacks on the Laotian Fighting Units in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, and sincerely negotiate with the Laotian Fighting Units in order to find a way to thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords and other agreements it has signed with the Laotian side.

    寮国战斗部队抗议老挝政府组织片面选举
    新华社河内二十六日电　老挝消息：老挝王国政府片面组织的选举，已经在十二月二十五日举行。
    寮国战斗部队曾经一再表示反对老挝王国政府举行片面选举。在这次片面选举举行前四天，即十二月二十一日，寮国政治代表团曾经写信给老挝国际监督和监察委员会主席，对老挝王国当局的做法提出抗议。这封信指出，这种片面选举是和日内瓦协议相违背的，寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员应该被允许参加普选。
    这封信还要求老挝王国方面停止它的一切军事活动，停止它对桑怒和丰沙里两省的寮国战斗部队的武装攻击，同寮国战斗部队诚心诚意地进行谈判，以便找到彻底实施日内瓦协议和它同寮国方面签订的其他协定的办法。
