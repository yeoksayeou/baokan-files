    The state-owned and cooperative commercial departments in Kunming, Yunnan Province, generally do not care about the lives of their employees. In the cloth group of the first store of Kunming Department Store, because there are too few salespersons, each person has to work eleven or twelve hours a day, and some have not had a vacation for two or three months. If the employees do not get rest, their health will naturally deteriorate. In the first half of October, out of the three hundred and five employees in the first store of Kunming Department Store, ninety-two people were ill. Among the twenty-one people in the wholesale department, sometimes as many as eleven were sick. Some employees have relatively low wages and support a relatively large population, with an average of less than ten yuan per person per month, including the dependents they support, and some even less than seven yuan. These people have difficulties in life. Is it because there are no welfare funds? No. The provincial and municipal state-owned companies alone have accumulated more than 18,200 yuan in employee subsidies in the first half of this year, and the four district cooperatives have also accumulated 3,893 yuan. The difficulty subsidies for trade union members are rarely used. The care for female staff is particularly poor. Many companies have nursing rooms in name only, which are actually used as rest rooms or small canteens for cadres. The Kunming Department Store does not have a nursing room, and female salespersons with children have to breastfeed at their work place, which affects both their work and the health of their children.
    The leading staff of these state-owned and cooperative commercial departments usually talk about relying on the employees, tapping the work potential of the employees, and giving full play to the enthusiasm of the employees. However, they cannot go deep into the masses, understand the sufferings of the masses, and sincerely help the masses to solve the difficulties in life and work. It should be recognized that only by caring about the lives of the masses can we improve the labor enthusiasm of the employees and do a good job.

### 要关心职工的生活

    要关心职工的生活
    云南省昆明市的国营和合作社营商业部门，普遍不关心职工的生活。昆明市百货公司第一门市部的布匹组，因为售货员太少，每人每天要工作十一、二个小时，有的已经有两、三个月没有休假了。职工们得不到休息，身体的健康状况自然就会坏。十月上半月，在昆明市百货公司第一门市部的三百零五个职工中，就有九十二个人得了病，在批发部的二十一人中，有时竟病倒了十一人。一部分职工工资收入比较少，负担的人口比较多，连同负担人口在内，平均每人每月不到十元，有的还不到七元，这些人的生活是有困难的。是不是没有福利经费呢？不是的。省级和市级的国营公司仅今年上半年就积压职工补助费一万八千二百多元，四个区合作社也积压了三千八百九十三元。工会会员的困难补助费很少使用。对女工作人员的照顾特别差，很多公司形式上有哺乳室，实际上变成干部的休息室或小食堂。市百货公司没有哺乳室，有孩子的女售货员只好在工作地点喂奶，既影响工作又影响孩子的健康。
    这些国营和合作社营商业部门的领导工作人员，平时口口声声说要依靠职工，挖掘职工的工作潜力，发挥职工的积极性，而他们却不能深入到群众中去，了解群众的疾苦，真心诚意地帮助群众去解决生活和工作上的困难。应该认识到只有关心群众的生活，才能提高职工的劳动热情，作好工作。
