Soil and Water Conservation is a Fundamental Measure for Increasing Agricultural Production in Mountainous Areas
Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

Based on the instructions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I, along with six scientific personnel from the fields of botany, geography, and agriculture, inspected soil and water conservation work in western and northern Shanxi Province from September 10th to 26th of this year. Thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of party and government leaders at all levels in Shanxi Province, we were able to inspect Taiyuan, Fenyang, Lishan, Taigu, Ningwu, Shenchi, Wuzhai, Kelan, Xingxian, Datong, Yanggao, and other places in half a month. We also inspected the soil and water conservation work in Wangjiagou in Lishan, Caijiaya in Xingxian, and Daquanshan in Yanggao in more detail. We held eleven symposiums with responsible comrades from some local governments, farmers, labor models, and scientific workers, and gained a preliminary understanding and experience of the general situation of soil and water conservation in the Jinxi and Jinbei areas. I will write it down below.

I.
Soil and water conservation is an important measure to improve the production and living standards of people in mountainous areas, and it is closely related to agricultural production. We know that the total precipitation in the Loess Plateau area, although generally only 250 to 500 millimeters per year, is not considered small if it can be used as much as possible. However, the natural conditions here have their peculiarities. Rainfall is concentrated in the late summer and early autumn, with the rainfall in July, August, and September accounting for 50% to 75% of the total annual rainfall. Moreover, the annual variability is very large, averaging 20% to 30%. Coupled with the natural conditions of highly undulating terrain and loose loess properties, a large amount of water is lost during heavy rains. At the same time, with the large loss of water, fertile soil is also washed away. It is estimated that the Loess Plateau area loses an average of 37 million tons of soil per square kilometer per year. The nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers lost from these soils each year are dozens of times more than the chemical fertilizers currently used nationwide, resulting in low yields and a lack of fertilizers, feeds, and fuels. In addition, the reactionary government in the past only knew how to exploit farmers, and farmers were forced to go to the mountains to reclaim wasteland, planting extensively and harvesting sparsely, which made soil erosion even more serious. This not only caused the Loess Plateau to have a phenomenon of nine droughts in ten years, but also caused serious disasters in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. It is obvious that in mountainous areas, agricultural production cannot be increased without grasping the fundamental measure of soil and water conservation. And to do a good job in soil and water conservation, it is also necessary to organize farmers to work together and cooperate. The experience of working farmers also proves this. Among the bumper harvest labor models we met in the three special districts of Yuci, Xinxian, and Yanbei in Shanxi this time, almost none of them did not take soil and water conservation measures. Such as Li Jinbao in Lishan, Jia Baozhi in Xingxian, and Gao Jincai in Yanggao. Whether they adopt field projects such as building contour ridges, building terraced fields, and digging fish scale pits, water conservancy measures such as building dams for siltation, digging lying cattle pits, drainage ditches, building dry wells, and building valley weirs, or improving cultivation techniques such as deep plowing, close planting, and grass-crop rotation, as well as planting trees and grass and developing animal husbandry, almost none of them are not for water storage and soil conservation and rational utilization of water and soil resources, and therefore none of them are not soil and water conservation measures. For example, Jia Baozhi used methods such as building terraced fields and digging water cellars to increase the output of the Baijiagou Production Cooperative's 2,000 mu of land from an average of only 40 jin of grain per mu in the past to an average of 147 jin per mu in 1953. Although there was a severe drought in northwestern Shanxi this year, it is estimated that the cooperative can still produce 50 jin per mu, which is twice as much as the land of individual farmers outside the cooperative who have not taken these measures. Another example is Li Jinbao, who obtained a bumper harvest by using deep plowing (to preserve soil moisture) and close planting methods. In 1954, the 11 mu of high-yield land in the Lijia Gou Cooperative averaged 1,030 jin of corn per mu, of which one mu produced 1,432 jin. It can be seen from this that soil and water conservation work in the Loess Plateau area has a significant role in increasing agricultural production.

How can soil and water conservation work be carried out to achieve the maximum rational utilization of soil and water resources? According to our inspection this time, it is necessary to adopt a unified plan for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water resources, and carry out comprehensive development in accordance with local conditions. Although various relevant departments have done a lot of soil and water conservation work within their respective business scopes in the past, and have also played a certain role, due to the lack of a unified plan, there are often conflicts between wasteland reclamation, grazing, and closing hillsides for afforestation; stopping farming, returning land to forestry, and closing hillsides for afforestation also affect the solution of the masses' grain, fuel, feed, and fertilizer problems. The masses have opinions on this practice of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water resources not cooperating with each other. Moreover, since the phenomenon of soil erosion is related to natural factors such as landforms, hydrology, vegetation, climate, soil, and geology, when taking transformation measures, it is necessary to take comprehensive measures of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water resources with emphasis and distinction according to different natural characteristics, and carry out overall planning. And it should gradually transition on the basis of developing agricultural production, so that forestry and animal husbandry in mountainous areas can be appropriately developed. This is in line with both the long-term interests and the current interests of farmers, and also in line with natural laws.

It should be particularly pointed out that the high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement in our country has arrived. The development of agricultural cooperation will greatly improve labor productivity and save a lot of labor, which creates extremely favorable conditions for soil and water conservation work. Therefore, at the same time as agricultural cooperation, it is necessary and also possible to develop diversified economies and take larger-scale soil and water conservation measures to change the current face of production in mountainous areas. At the same time, only by carrying out soil and water conservation work, building field projects, planting trees and afforestation, planting fruit trees, sowing pasture, improving cultivation, and running small-scale water conservancy can the production income of cooperatives continue to increase. Furthermore, through the long-term planning of production in mountainous areas, the farmers can see the development prospects of turning poor mountain valleys into rich mountain valleys, thereby promoting the development of cooperation in turn.

In this way, soil and water conservation work occupies an important position in our country's great socialist construction. It is not only a fundamental method for developing river water conservancy and fundamentally controlling river water hazards, but also a great mass work of transforming nature, and an effective measure to improve the production and living standards of people in mountainous areas and reduce flood disasters in the plains. Mountainous areas in Shanxi Province account for 70% of the total area of the province, and its importance cannot be ignored. Especially at present, soil and water conservation should become the main content of the technical reform of agricultural cooperation in mountainous areas, and it must also become the main work for relevant scientific researchers to serve agricultural cooperation in mountainous areas.

Our country's Loess Plateau area has a total of 370,000 square kilometers, of which the hilly and gully area accounts for 238,000 square kilometers, or 64%, and the plateau gully area accounts for 45,000 square kilometers, or 12%. The two together account for 76% of the area of the Loess Plateau, in addition to rocky mountain areas and sandy areas, etc. That is, in plateau gully areas such as the Dongzhiyuan in eastern Gansu, the area of gullies has also expanded to more than 50%. In May of this year, I had the opportunity to visit the Soil and Water Conservation Experimental Station of the Ministry of Water Conservancy and the soil and water conservation work of nearby farmers in Xifeng Town, Pingliang Special District, Gansu, together with Academician Gerasimov, a Soviet geographer, and Corresponding Academician Kovda, a soil scientist. They pointed out that soil erosion in eastern Gansu is mainly gully erosion rather than surface erosion; at the same time, "fixing gullies" is also a passive way to prevent the advancement of gully heads, and the natural slope of gullies and rural roads will cause pits and erosion.

Therefore, I believe that the fundamental problem of soil erosion on the Loess Plateau is the transformation and utilization of gullies. Because (1) gullies are weak links where runoff and water and soil are concentrated, causing scouring, landslides, and pits; (2) gullies are often the most fertile. That is to say, gullies are the concentrated point of contradiction of soil and water loss. What the Loess Plateau lacks is water, and the water in the gullies is the most abundant; what the Loess Plateau lacks is fertilizer, and the gullies are also places with more fertilizer. Therefore, planting trees and crops in the gullies is always productive. If the gullies can be properly utilized and transformed, coupled with other measures on the ridges, mounds, and slopes, the problem of soil erosion in the Loess Plateau area can be fundamentally solved.

II.
In their arduous and protracted production struggle, the ancient working people of our country obtained a lot of valuable knowledge about soil and water conservation. Among them, the most cherished and universally adopted by working people in mountainous areas all over the world is the terraced field system. We do not know when terraced fields originated, but Wang Zhen's "Book of Agriculture" in the Yuan Dynasty not only has a description and map of terraced fields, but also tells us how the common people were forced by the ruling class to have no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth, and then came up with the method of opening mountains to build terraced fields. His terraced field poem is extremely vivid and realistic. The poem says: "There are many kinds of fields in the world that are equally divided, but who names the fields outside the world? Neither water nor land, where is it? There are no field paths on dangerous peaks and steep slopes. The steps are cut horizontally into ladders, and you can raise your hand to touch them and only start to climb with your feet. Stooping forward to prevent falling, tenants still carry tools. Reclaim and dig as appropriate, either east or west, know when to plant early without biting the navel; quickly hoe the seedlings to the same height, and fear drought and think of clouds and rainbows. Facing the wind and sun, the face is dark, the four limbs are thin and the muscles are like cuts; hoping for a meager harvest to overcome the weeds, the hard work to this point makes people want to cry. The rich and poor of farm families are like clouds and mud, the poor have no cone to place and the rich look lost. The ancient well system can be investigated today, one husband and one hundred acres can live in peace, and the remaining husband has half a kui of fields. Am I not alone a commoner? Can there be no piece of land to fill the plowing? The tenant industry now wants to be equal to the blue clouds. One full meal is only enough for children and wives, and the example of paying rent is the same, ashamed of a thousand acres of fields on the plain." What a poem full of people's nature this is. This poem is full of accusations and indignation from beginning to end. We know from historical records that the Yuan Dynasty was a time when big officials and landlords squeezed the common people, and the people were unable to make a living. They encroached on the fertile land reclaimed by farmers, forcing farmers to go to the mountains to reclaim wasteland. The acts of seizing and plundering were so common that even the emperor at the time had to issue an edict to prohibit them.

Therefore, terraced fields are a method of maintaining soil and water created by the working people in the feudal era who were forced to go to the mountains to reclaim wasteland, based on practice. At present, the broad masses of working people in our mountainous areas are still continuing to create many valuable experiences in the struggle against nature. At the same time, thanks to the wise leadership of the Party and the government, these experiences can be sorted out and improved in a timely manner. According to what we learned in Shanxi, two examples can be cited as typical experiences of the working people in the struggle against soil erosion.

Example 1, Daquanshan. Daquanshan is located 25 miles southeast of Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, and belongs to the loess hilly area in the upper reaches of the Yongding River. Daquanshan includes four small mountains: Daquanshan, Jinggouliang, Camel Ao, and Sunjiashan, with a total area of about 500 mu. Before the transformation, this mountain was an extremely barren place. Daquanshan alone had 32 small gullies and 9 large gullies. The gullies advanced about 1-2 meters per year. Soil erosion was serious. The mountain did not grow mountain firewood or grass, and people had difficulty living there. From 1938 to 1945, Zhang Fenglin and Gao Jincai came to Daquanshan one after another to reclaim wasteland and cultivate land, planning to save some money to build a temple and leave a name. However, here it was "crops don't grow in drought, and floods cause disasters," and life forced them to fight against drought and floods. After several failures, they finally found a series of methods to fight against soil erosion and made a governance policy of "If you want to use water, you must first manage water; storing water and conserving soil can resist drought." They adopted field projects such as digging fish scale pits, blocking gullies, building ridges, building terraced fields, and opening canals according to local conditions, and planted fruit trees and forests and made some improvements in cultivation techniques. After 17 years of hard work, especially after liberation, with the encouragement and support of local party and government leading organs, the appearance of Daquanshan has been completely changed: flowers and fruits are all over the mountain, willows have become forests, production has developed, living standards have improved, and soil erosion has been basically stopped. The entire Daquanshan now has more than 30,000 fruit trees and forests, with an annual income of 340 yuan. It is estimated that in five years, the annual income can be more than 3,000 yuan. At the same time, they also have dozens of mu of terraced fields and dam land planted with crops, which have a good harvest. Last year, they sold a total of 3,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. They are very grateful for the leadership and help of the Communist Party after liberation, and their ideological awareness has been improved to varying degrees. Now they are no longer superstitious. Both of them have joined agricultural cooperatives, and have married wives, had children, built new houses, and are living a happy life.

Example 2, Yangjingdi. Yangjingdi Township, Pingshun, is located on the Zhuozhang River and is basically a rocky mountain area. It is surrounded by mountains on the east, south, and north, with uneven terrain, many mountains and little land, thick stones and thin soil, steep slopes and deep gullies, and rapid rivers. Some farmers were forced by life to recklessly open up barren mountain slopes and indiscriminate felling of trees and deep digging of firewood roots, resulting in serious soil erosion. According to statistics from 1942 to 1947, a total of more than 2,000 mu of barren mountains were opened up. At the same time, 58 mu of good land were washed away in the Liyuan Gou River alone, and another 150 mu of land were being eroded. In addition, more than 580 dikes collapsed every year, turning large tracts of good land into rocky beaches. This led to a gradual decline in agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production, with an average yield of 150 jin per mu and an average of only 250 jin per person. Therefore, farmers had difficult lives, with 70% of farmers living on chaff and vegetables for half a year. However, under the leadership of the Party, relying on the active efforts and hard work of the masses for several years, and relying on the support of scientific forces, the face of life in Yangjingdi Township has undergone great changes, and the phenomenon of soil erosion has been basically controlled. In 1953, a survey and measurement team headed by Hao Jingsheng, a researcher at the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, arrived in Yangjingdi Township. They conducted surveys on terrain, soil, geology, etc., and together with township cadres and the masses, conducted on-site surveys. According to the natural environment and social conditions, they formulated a 15-year construction plan for the comprehensive development of land utilization, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in the entire territory of Yangjingdi Township by gully, slope, and sub-area according to local conditions. And immediately publicize it to the masses, hand it over to the masses for in-depth discussion, repeatedly revise it, and then convene a township-wide mass meeting to unanimously adopt this plan. At the same time, under the unified leadership of the Party branch, the Yangjingdi Township Soil and Water Conservation Committee was established on the basis of cooperatives to start planning this matter. The entire township was mobilized to embark on the road of planned construction. In the past few years, they have overcome many difficulties and achieved great achievements. In the management of mountain slopes, the method of first closing and then creating was adopted, closing hillsides for afforestation of 10,000 mu, sowing 3,140 mu of barren mountains, building 234 retaining walls, and repairing 39 mu of terraced fields. In the management of gullies, the method of "from the top of the mountain to the bottom of the mountain, first branch gullies then dry gullies, from inside the river to outside the river" was adopted. A total of 280 valley weirs have been built in various branch and dry gullies in the township, and 44,000 gully forests have been planted and protected. At the same time, many apples, grapes, pears, walnuts, and peppers have also been planted. Because the problems of drinking water and grazing for livestock have been solved, animal husbandry has also been developed accordingly. As a result of the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, the income of farmers in Yangjingdi Township has increased. This year, the cooperative led by Wu Houli had a total income of 76,223 yuan, with an average income of 79.56 yuan per adult and child, which can be converted into 1,326 jin of raw grain. The level of production and living has been greatly improved, and the appearance of the village has also been renewed. Seeing these facts and thinking of the 15-year vision, the farmers could not help but sing the poems of "High mountain pines and cypresses, walnut gullies, willows planted on both sides of the riverbed; five fruits are all over the mountains and fields, mules and horses are in groups and the five grains are abundant", which further increased their confidence in building mountainous areas.

The above shows that the experience created and accumulated by the working farmers of our country in the long-term struggle against soil erosion is extremely rich and valuable. Our scientific workers must attach great importance to these experiences, learn from these experiences, and, as Chairman Mao instructed, take the common people as teachers and honestly and diligently be pupils of the masses. Those who do not pay attention to the experience of the masses, and even say that Chinese farmers do not know the importance of soil and water conservation, etc., must wake up as soon as possible in order to make contributions to the construction of new China.

At the same time, since the experience of the masses inevitably has locality and limitations, we cannot stay at this level. Scientific workers must carry out huge research and experimental work on the basis of summarizing the experience of the masses, and use modern science and technology to improve and guide the work of the masses in accordance with local conditions. For example, as mentioned above, the construction of terraced fields has a long history in our country; but under different natural conditions (terrain slope, soil properties, etc.), how exactly terraced fields should be constructed does not yet have a complete set of experience and scientific data. Another example is that although the experience of Daquanshan in Yanggao is very good, there are still many problems to be solved by scientific workers in terms of fully utilizing land resources, carrying out comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, improving soil fertility, and selecting fruit tree varieties. In the past, the common people have cultivated some pasture, shrubs, and vines, which have played a role in covering the ground and maintaining soil and water; but what is suitable for this area is not necessarily suitable for another area, and must be carefully selected by botanists. For example, the alfalfa cultivated by the Tianshui Soil and Water Conservation Station in Gansu has been widely promoted in the Northwest and is willingly accepted by farmers, which has played a great role in soil and water conservation, which is one example. There are also some basic theoretical problems, such as the nature and formation of loess, the types of erosion (runoff, pits, collapses, landslides, etc.) and the study of microclimate, etc., which should also occupy an important position in soil and water conservation research work. Only in this way can the mass soil and water conservation work be timely scientifically guided and improved.

With the advent of the high tide of agricultural cooperation and the development of large-scale soil and water conservation movement, more urgent and more demands will be placed on the scientific research work of soil and water conservation. Our scientific workers should complete this great and glorious task with full confidence.

    水土保持是山区农业增产的一项根本措施
    中国科学院副院长　竺可桢
    根据全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国科学院的指示，我和植物、地理、农业等方面的科学工作人员共六人，在本年九月十日到二十六日视察了山西省西部和北部的水土保持工作。由于山西省党政各级负责同志的热情帮助，使我们能够在半个月内视察了太原、汾阳、离山、太谷、宁武、神池、五寨、岢岚、兴县、大同、阳高等地，并且较详细地视察了离山王家沟、兴县蔡家崖和阳高大泉山的水土保持工作，和一些地方政府的负责同志、农民、劳动模范、科学工作者举行了十一次座谈会，对晋西、晋北地区水土保持工作的大略情况有了初步的认识和体会，现在把它写在下面。一
    水土保持是提高山区人民生产、生活水平的重要措施，它同农业生产是密切结合的。我们知道，黄土高原区的总降水量，虽然每年一般只有二百五十到五百公厘，如果能够尽量利用，还不能算少。但是这里的自然条件有它的特殊性，雨量集中在夏末秋初，七、八、九三个月的雨量占全年的百分之五十到百分之七十五，而且年变率很大，平均达到百分之二十到三十，加上地形起伏坡度很大和黄土性质粗松等自然条件，遇到暴雨，水份大量流走。同时随着水份的大量流失，肥沃的土壤也被冲走了。据估计，黄土高原区每平方公里平均每年损失土壤三千七百万公吨，每年从这些土壤中流失的氮、磷、钾肥料达到目前全国所施用化学肥料的好几十倍，以致产量低落，肥料、饲料、燃料俱缺。再加上过去反动政府只知剥削农民，农民被迫上山开荒，广种薄收，使水土流失更加严重，不但使黄土高原有十年九旱的现象，而且造成了黄河中、下游的严重灾害。显而易见，在山区如不抓住水土保持这一根本措施，是不能提高农业生产的。而要想搞好水土保持，也必须组织农民群策群力合作进行。劳动农民的经验也证明这一点。在我们这次所到的山西榆次、忻县、雁北等三个专区所遇见的一些丰产劳动模范中，几乎没有一个不是采取水土保持措施的。如离山的李金宝、兴县的贾保执和阳高的高进才。不论他们所采取的是修等高埂、筑梯田、挖鱼鳞坑等田间工程，打坝淤地、挖卧牛坑、排水渠、打旱井、修谷坊等水利措施，或者是深耕、密植、草田轮作等耕作技术的改良以及植树种草、发展畜牧业等，几乎没有一样不是为了蓄水保土、合理利用水土资源，因而也没有一样不就是水土保持措施。例如贾保执用修梯田、挖水窖等办法，使白家沟生产合作社二千亩地从过去平均每亩只产粮食四十斤提高到一九五三年平均产一百四十七斤。今年山西西北部虽遇大旱，但估计合作社每亩还可产五十斤，较社外单干户没有进行这些措施的土地平均多产一倍。又如李金宝用深耕（保墒）密植办法得到丰收。一九五四年李家沟合作社十一亩丰产地平均每亩收玉蜀黍一千零三十斤，其中有一亩产至一千四百三十二斤。由此可见，黄土高原区的水土保持工作对农业增产有着多么重大的作用。
    要怎样进行水土保持工作才能达到水土资源最大限度的合理利用呢？据我们这次的视察看来，必须因地制宜地采取农、林、牧、水的统一规划，进行综合开发。过去各有关部门虽然在各自的业务范围内做了不少水土保持工作，也起了一定作用，但因为缺乏统一的规划，往往开荒、放牧和封山育林发生矛盾；停耕、还林和封山育林又影响群众的粮食和燃料、饲料、肥料问题的解决。群众对这种农、林、牧、水互不配合的做法是有意见的。而且由于水土流失现象关系到地貌、水文、植被、气候、土壤、地质等自然因素，采取改造措施的时候，就必须根据不同的自然特点，有重点有分别地采取农、林、牧、水的综合措施，进行全面规划。并且应该在发展农业生产的基础上，逐渐过渡，使山区林、牧业得到适当的发展。这是既符合农民的长远利益和当前利益，又符合自然规律的。
    特别应该指出，目前我国农业合作化运动的高潮已经到来。农业合作化的发展，将大大提高劳动生产率，节省大量劳动力，这样便为水土保持工作创造了极为有利的条件。因此，在农业合作化的同时，必然要求而且也有可能来发展多种经济，采取较大规模的水土保持措施，以改变目前山区生产的面貌。同时，只有开展水土保持工作，修筑田间工程、植树造林、栽种果树、播种牧草、改进耕作、举办小型水利，才能使合作社的生产收入不断增加。再通过山区生产的远景规划，使农民看到了把穷山沟变成富山沟的发展前途，从而反过来促进合作化的发展。
    这样，水土保持工作在我国伟大的社会主义建设中占有重要的位置。它不仅是开发河流水利根治河流水害的根本方法，而且是一项群众性改造自然的伟大工作，是提高山区人民生产、生活水平，减免平原洪涝灾害的有效措施。山西省山区占全省总面积的百分之七十，它的重要性是不可忽视的。特别在目前，水土保持应该成为山区农业合作化技术改革的主要工作内容，同时也必然要成为有关的科学研究人员为山区农业合作化服务的主要工作。
    我国黄土高原区共有三十七万平方公里，其中丘陵沟壑区占了二十三万八千平方公里，即百分之六十四，高原沟壑区占四万五千平方公里，即百分之十二，两者共占黄土高原区面积的百分之七十六，此外是石山区和风沙区等。即在高原沟壑区如陇东董志原上，沟壑的面积也扩展到百分之五十以上。今年五月间有机会和苏联地理学家格拉西莫夫院士、土壤学家柯夫达通讯院士一同到甘肃平凉专区西峰镇，参观了水利部的水土保持试验站和附近农民的水土保持工作。他们曾指出陇东的水土流失主要是沟蚀而非面蚀；同时，“固沟”也是消极的防止沟头进展的办法，沟的自然坡度、乡村的道路都会引起陷穴和侵蚀。
    因此，我认为在黄土高原上水土流失的根本问题是对于沟的改造和利用问题。因为（1）沟是迳流集中、水土集中，引起冲刷、泻溜、陷穴的薄弱环节；（2）沟中常常是最肥沃的。就是说，沟是水土流失的矛盾集中点。黄土高原缺乏的是水，而沟中的水份最丰沛；黄土高原缺乏的是肥料，而沟也是肥料比较多的地方，因此，在沟中植树种庄稼总是丰产的。如能对沟加以适当的利用和改造，再配合梁、峁、坡上的其它措施，就能够从根本上解决黄土高原区的水土流失问题。二
    我国古代劳动人民在他们艰苦卓绝的长期生产斗争的经验中，获得了不少对于水土保持的宝贵知识，其中最可珍视而为全世界山区劳动人民所普遍采用的是梯田这个制度。梯田起于何时我们还不知道，但元王祯农书中不但已有梯田的说明和图，而且告诉我们老百姓如何被统治阶级逼迫得上天无路，入地无门，才想出开山造梯田的办法。他的梯田诗极其生动逼真，诗说：“世间田制多等夷，有田世外谁名题，非水非陆何所兮，危巅峻麓无田蹊。层磴横削高为梯，举手扪之足始跻，伛偻前向防颠挤，佃作有具仍兼携。随宜垦斸或东西，知时种早无噬脐；稚苗亟耨同高低，十九畏旱思云霓。凌冒风日面且黧，四体臞瘁肌若刲；冀有薄获胜稗梯，力田至此嗟欲啼。田家贫富如云泥，贫无锥置富望迷。古称井地今可稽，一夫百亩容安栖，余夫田数犹半圭，我今岂独非黔黎，可无片壤充耕犁，佃业今欲青云齐。一饱才足及孥妻，输租有例将何齐，惭愧平地田千畦。”这是何等富有人民性的一首诗。这首诗从头到尾充满了控诉和愤慨。我们从历史的记载知道元朝正是大官地主压榨老百姓，民不聊生的时候。他们侵夺农民开垦的良田，使农夫不得不上山开荒。霸占掠夺行为竟如此普遍，甚至当时皇帝也不得不下谕禁止。
    所以梯田是封建时代劳动人民被迫上山开荒，在实践的基础上所创造出来的保持水土的一种办法。目前我们山区的广大劳动群众在同自然作斗争中，仍在继续创造着许多宝贵的经验。同时由于党和政府的英明领导，这些经验都能得到及时的整理和提高。根据我们在山西所了解到的，可以举两个例子作为劳动人民同水土流失作斗争的典型经验。
    例一，大泉山。大泉山在山西阳高县东南二十五里，属于永定河上游的黄土丘陵区。大泉山一共包括有大泉山、井沟梁、骆驼凹、孙家山等四个小山，面积共约五百亩。这个山在未改造以前，是一个极其贫瘠的地方，单大泉山一座小山，就有小沟三十二道，大沟九道，沟壑前进每年约一——二公尺，水土流失严重，山上不长山柴蒿草，人们难以生活。一九三八年到一九四五年，张凤林、高进才两人先后来到大泉山，开荒种地，打算积点钱修庙留名。但是这里是“天旱庄稼不长，雨涝又要成灾”，生活迫使他们不得不向天旱和洪水作斗争。经过了好几次的失败，他们才摸到了一系列的同水土流失作斗争的方法，作出了“要想用水、先当治水；蓄水保土，就能抗旱”的治理方针。他们因地制宜地采取了挖鱼鳞坑、堵沟、培埂、修梯田、开渠等田间工程，并且种植果树林木，进行了一些耕作技术的改良。经过十七年来的辛勤劳动，特别在解放以后得到当地党政领导机关的鼓励和支持，大泉山的面貌已经彻底改变：花果满山，杨柳成林，生产发展，生活提高，水土流失已基本上被制止。整个大泉山现有果树林木三万多株，每年收入三百四十元，预计五年以后，每年可收入三千多元。同时他们还有几十亩梯田和坝埝地种着农作物，收成很好。去年他们两人共卖给国家余粮三千斤。他们对解放后共产党的领导和帮助很是感激，思想觉悟有了不同程度的提高，现在也不再迷信了。两人都加入了农业合作社，并且娶了老婆，生了孩子，盖上新房，过着幸福的生活。
    例二，羊井底。山西平顺羊井底乡在浊漳河上，基本上是个石山区。东南北三面环山，起伏不平，山多地少，石厚土薄，坡陡沟深，河流急湍。有些农民被生活所迫，乱开荒山陡坡和滥伐树株以及深刨柴根，因而形成了严重的水土流失现象。据一九四二年到一九四七年的统计，共开荒山约达二千余亩。在这同时，仅黎园沟一道河内就被冲掉良田五十八亩，还有一百五十亩土地受着冲刷。此外，每年还有五百八十多条堤岸坍塌，使大块良田变为石滩。致使农、林、牧生产逐渐降低，每亩平均产量一百五十斤，每人平均仅得二百五十斤。因此农民生活困难，百分之七十的农民过着糠菜半年粮的生活。但是，羊井底乡在党的领导下，依靠着群众几年来的积极努力、艰苦奋斗，依靠着科学力量的支持，他们的生活面貌已起了很大变化，水土流失现象已得到基本控制。一九五三年，以中国科学院植物研究所研究员郝景盛为首的一个勘查测量小组到达了羊井底乡。他们对地形、土壤、地质等进行了调查，同乡干部、群众一道，到现场查勘，根据自然环境和社会条件，分沟分坡分片因地制宜地制定出羊井底乡全境土地利用、农林牧业全面发展的十五年建设规划。并且立即向群众宣传，交给群众深入讨论，反复修改，然后召开全乡群众大会一致通过了这一规划。同时在党支部统一领导下，以合作社为基础成立了羊井底乡水土保持委员会，着手筹划这件事，全乡动员起来，走上有计划建设的道路。几年来克服了不少困难，取得了很大的成就。在山坡治理上，采取了先封后造的办法，封山育林一万亩，荒山播种三千一百四十亩，砌岸二百三十四条，修梯田三十九亩。在沟壑治理上，采取了“自山顶到山底、先支沟后干沟、由河内而河外”的办法，已在全乡各个支沟干沟内建筑起谷坊二百八十座，并栽护沟林四万四千株，同时，还栽了很多苹果、葡萄、梨和核桃、花椒。因为牲畜饮水、吃草问题得到解决，畜牧业也得到相应的发展。农、林、牧全面发展的结果，羊井底乡农民的收入增加了。今年武侯梨领导的社总共收入七万六千二百二十三元，大人小孩每人平均收入七十九点五六元，可折原粮一千三百二十六斤，生产、生活水平大大提高，村庄的面貌也焕然一新。农民们看到这些事实和想到十五年的远景，不禁就唱起“高山松柏核桃沟，河床两岸插杨柳；满山遍野是五果，骡马成群五谷丰收”的诗歌，更加提高了建设山区的信心。
    以上说明了我国劳动农民长期以来，在同水土流失作斗争中所创造和积累的经验是极为丰富宝贵的。我们科学工作人员必须十分重视这些经验，学习这些经验，要像毛主席所指示的那样，拜老百姓为老师，老老实实、勤勤恳恳地当群众的小学生。那些不重视群众经验，甚至还说什么中国农民不知水土保持的重要等等的人，必须及早清醒过来，才会对新中国的建设事业有所贡献。
    同时，由于群众的经验还不可避免地带有地方性和局限性，我们不能停留在这一个水准上。科学工作者必须在总结群众经验的基础上，进行巨大的研究试验工作，因地制宜地用现代的科学技术去提高和指导群众的工作。例如，修筑梯田，正如上面所说，在我国已有很长的历史；但在不同的自然条件（地形坡度、土壤性质等）下，梯田究竟应该如何修筑，则还没有一套完整的经验和科学数据。又如阳高大泉山的经验虽然很好，但在充分利用土地资源、进行农、林、牧业的综合开发和土壤肥力的提高、果树品种的选择等方面还有不少问题，有待科学工作者深入研究解决。过去老百姓已培育了若干牧草、灌木、藤类，对于覆盖地面保持水土起了作用；但是适宜于这个区域的不尽适宜于另一个区域，必须由植物学家精心选择。如甘肃天水水土保持站培育的草木樨，目前在西北已大量推广，为农民所乐意接受，对水土保持起了很大作用，即是一例。还有一些基本性的理论问题，如黄土的性质和成因、侵蚀类型（迳流、陷穴、崩塌、泻溜等）和小气候等的研究，在水土保持研究工作中也应占有重要的位置。只有这样，才能使群众性的水土保持工作得到及时的科学指导和提高。
    随着农业合作化高潮的到来，随着大规模水土保持运动的开展，对水土保持的科学研究工作将会提出更迫切更多的要求，我们科学工作者应该满怀信心地来完成这个伟大而光荣的任务。
