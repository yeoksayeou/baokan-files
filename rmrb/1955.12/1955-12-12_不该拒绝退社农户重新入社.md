Some farmers, especially middle peasants, joined cooperatives and then withdrew. After a year or two of observing, they feel that joining the cooperative is better, and they want to rejoin. This is a phenomenon that was bound to happen in the first few years of the collectivization movement. It should be affirmed that former cooperative members wanting to return to the cooperative is a good phenomenon. This shows that our cooperatives are well-run and truly play a demonstrative role. Therefore, we should adopt a warm and welcoming attitude towards these farmers and should absolutely not treat them coldly or attack them. However, this undesirable phenomenon is currently occurring in some places.

During the rectification of cooperatives this summer, some farmers in the Shilituo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yutian County, Hebei Province, requested to withdraw from the cooperative. At that time, the cooperative rectification work team had patiently persuaded them, but it was ineffective, and they had to be allowed to withdraw. Because this cooperative increased production by more than one-third compared to last year, and due to the further development of the collectivization movement, most of the withdrawn farmers requested to return to the cooperative. At that time, it was the busy season for wheat sowing. The cooperative cadres and the township branch, on the one hand, sought the opinions of the county cadres in the village and agreed to absorb them into the cooperative and planned to sow wheat uniformly. On the other hand, they went to the district committee for approval. Unexpectedly, an accident happened at this time. As soon as Lu Guilan, deputy secretary of the district committee, heard that some of the withdrawn farmers of the Shilituo Agricultural Production Cooperative wanted to rejoin, she unreasonably asked, "Why did they leave and then come back? No way!" The cooperative cadres explained that these farmers, after a year of comparison, indeed felt that joining the cooperative was better than working individually, so they were willing to return to the cooperative. However, Lu Guilan still refused to approve it. The cooperative cadres also explained that the wheat fields of some newly rejoined households had already been sown uniformly, and asked the district committee to consider it further. Lu Guilan firmly said, "It doesn't matter if the wheat has been sown. Return the wheat seeds that should be returned, and make up for the work that is owed." The cooperative cadres had no choice but to stop sowing wheat for the newly rejoined households and announced that they should withdraw from the cooperative. This phenomenon was not corrected until the Rural Work Department of the County Committee criticized it.

This is not the only example. In Xuejiazhuang, Hancheng District, Fengrun County, Hebei Province, two well-to-do middle peasant households joined the first agricultural production cooperative in the village after wheat sowing last year. During the spring plowing this year, these two well-to-do middle peasant households saw that their wheat was growing better than the cooperative's wheat. Due to the mischief of selfish and self-interested thoughts, they had the intention of withdrawing from the cooperative. Therefore, when delivering manure, they violated the cooperative's regulations and gave more manure to their own fields. Later, they insisted on withdrawing from the cooperative. Now, these two well-to-do middle peasant households want to return to the cooperative. Why? Because, first, they saw that the average grain yield of the cooperative had exceeded their own yield; second, the whole village has been collectivized, and they cannot even find someone to share a plow during the busy farming season. Their requests are urgent, but they were rejected by the director of the first cooperative. These two well-to-do middle peasant households earnestly stated that they were willing to make a serious self-criticism to all the cooperative members for the serious selfish and self-interested mistake of insisting on withdrawing from the cooperative this year, and at the same time, they guaranteed to correct it in the future, but the director of the first cooperative still refused to accept them. These two well-to-do middle peasant households had to apply to the second agricultural production cooperative in the village, but the director of the second cooperative also rejected their application: "The first cooperative doesn't want you, how can the second cooperative want you?" The director of the first cooperative even said that he would consider the requests of these two well-to-do middle peasant households after accepting landlords and rich peasants into the cooperative in the future. Both of these cooperative directors are Communist Party members.

Necessary investigations should be made on farmers who have withdrawn from the cooperative and want to rejoin, in order to understand whether they are truly willing. If they are truly willing, they should be welcomed back into the cooperative, and there should be no red tape restricting them from rejoining. As for the shortcomings that these farmers themselves have, even if they are relatively serious shortcomings, they should be educated on the premise of absorbing them into the cooperative, help them recognize and correct them, and the method of excluding them from joining the cooperative should not be adopted to conduct so-called "tests" on them. For working farmers, the cooperative is not only an organization for collective labor, but also a school for conducting socialist education. Only within the cooperative can all working farmers finally overcome shortcomings such as freedom, looseness, selfishness, and self-interest, and become new people with a high degree of socialist consciousness.

Comrade Mao Zedong taught us to cherish any tiny bit of socialist enthusiasm of the peasants and should not frustrate it. The same principle should be strictly observed in handling the issue of withdrawn farmers requesting to join the cooperative.

    不该拒绝退社农户重新入社
    黎言
    有些农户，特别是中农，入了社又退社，退了社看上一年半载，觉得还是入社好，又要求入社，这在合作化运动的头几年是必然会发生的现象。应该肯定，曾经退社的农户，再愿意回到社里来，这是一种好现象，这说明我们的合作社办好了，真正起了示范的作用。因此，对于这些农民，我们应该采取热情的欢迎的态度，绝对不应该冷淡他们和打击他们。可是，这种不应该发生的现象，目前在有些地方却在发生着。
    今年夏季整社时，河北省玉田县十里坨农业生产合作社中有一部分农户要求退社，当时，整社工作组曾经对他们进行过耐心的说服教育，但是无效，最后只得允许他们退社。由于这个合作社今年较去年增产三分之一以上，由于合作化运动的进一步发展，退社的农户中绝大部分要求重新回到社里来，当时，正是紧张的种麦时节，社干部和乡支部，一方面征求了在村的县干部的意见，同意吸收他们入社，并计划统一种麦；另一方面就去请示区委批准，想不到这时却发生了意外。区委副书记陆桂兰一听说十里坨农业生产合作社一部分退社的农户又要入社，就无理地发问：“为什么他们出去又回来？不行！”社干部就说明这些农户经过一年的对比，确实感到入社比单干强，所以才愿意重新回到社里来。但是陆桂兰还是拒绝批准，社干部又说明有些重新入社户的麦田已经统一播种的情况，要区委进一步考虑。陆桂兰又斩钉截铁地说：“种了麦子也不行，该还麦种还麦种，欠工补工。”社干部无法可想，只好停止给新入社户继续种麦，并且宣布要他们出社。直到县委农村工作部提出批评以后，这种现象才得到纠正。
    这还不是唯一的例子。河北省丰润县韩城区薛家庄，去年种麦之后，有两户富裕中农加入了这个村子的第一农业生产合作社。今年春耕时，这两户富裕中农看到自己的麦子比社里的麦子长得好，由于自私自利思想的作怪，就有了退社的打算，因此，在送粪时，又违反社的规定，多给自己的地里送了粪，以后就坚持要求退社了。现在，这两户富裕中农又要求回到社里来。为什么呢？因为，一来他们看到社里的粮食平均产量已经超过了他们的产量；二来全村已经合作化，农忙时节连搭犋的对象都找不到。他们的要求是迫切的，可是却被第一社的主任拒绝了。这两户富裕中农恳切地表示，愿意向全体社员检讨自己今年坚持退社的严重的自私自利的错误，同时保证今后一定改正，但第一社的主任还是拒绝接收他们。这两户富裕中农只得到这个村里的第二农业生产合作社去申请入社，第二社的主任同样拒绝了他们的申请：“一社不能要你们，二社怎能要你们？”一社主任甚至说过：将来接收地主富农入社以后，再考虑这两户富裕中农的要求。这两个社主任都是共产党员。
    对曾经退社又要求入社的农户，应该作必要的考察，以便了解他们是否确实自愿，如果确实自愿，就应该欢迎他们回到社里来，不该有任何清规戒律限制他们重新入社。至于这些农户本身存在的缺点，那怕是比较严重的缺点，应该在吸收他们入社的前提下，对他们进行教育，帮助他们认识和改正，而不能采取排斥他们入社的办法，去对他们进行所谓“考验”。合作社对于劳动农民来说，不但是集体劳动的组织，也是进行社会主义教育的学校，全体劳动农民只有在合作社之内才能最后克服自由散漫自私自利等缺点，而成为有高度社会主义觉悟的新人。
    毛泽东同志教导我们，要爱护农民的任何一点微小的社会主义积极性，不应当挫折它。在处理退社农民要求入社的问题上，同样要严格遵守这一原则。
