    Our great historian and writer Sima Qian, who lived in ancient China, was born 2,100 years ago. His magnificent historical work and realistic literary masterpiece, "Records of the Grand Historian," is one of our country's most valuable cultural heritages. Sima Qian brings glory to the Chinese people, and scholars in many countries around the world study and admire his work.

    Sima Qian's hometown is in present-day Hancheng County, Shaanxi Province. His father, Sima Tan, served as the Grand Astrologer in the Han Dynasty for a long time. This was a minor official in charge of "literature, history, astrology, and divination," and was not highly regarded. When Sima Qian was young, he studied and participated in farming and animal husbandry. At the age of twenty, he began his travels, traversing the Yellow River and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. He investigated mountains, rivers, products, customs, and sought out historical sites everywhere. He came into contact with the broad masses of the people. Later, he became a Gentleman-in-Waiting, an imperial guard. He followed Emperor Wu of Han to many places and was once sent to western Sichuan and Yunnan to negotiate with the tribes there. Three years after his father, Sima Tan, died, he became the Grand Astrologer. At that time, Emperor Wu of Han collected a large number of books and stored them in the imperial library, which was managed by the Grand Astrologer. With great enthusiasm and creative labor, Sima Qian began to collect historical materials from piles of unorganized bamboo slips and silk books. Due to offending Emperor Wu of Han, Sima Qian was thrown into prison and suffered torture and humiliation at the hands of cruel officials. He was sentenced to death. At that time, the death penalty could be redeemed with money. However, Sima Qian was a poor official and did not have the money to redeem himself. In order to fulfill his ideal of writing a "Records of the Grand Historian," he accepted another way to replace the death penalty, the most shameful "castration." This was a great destruction to his body and spirit. Later, he was employed by Emperor Wu of Han as a Palace Secretary. This position was held by eunuchs and was a kind of "sweeping slave, a minister of the boudoir." Under the torment of inner pain, Sima Qian insisted on writing his immortal work. He collected incredibly rich historical materials from ancient books and real life and carefully organized them. Before his death, he had basically completed the "Records of the Grand Historian."

    "Records of the Grand Historian" records the history of China's development from the Yellow Emperor to the time of Emperor Wu of Han, a period of three thousand years. The entire book consists of 130 volumes, with 526,500 characters. Sima Qian synthesized various styles of previous Chinese history books and creatively divided his work into five parts: Basic Annals, Tables, Treatises, Hereditary Houses, and Biographies. The Basic Annals take the succession of emperors of each dynasty as a thread, compile them by year, and record the outlines of the most important historical events. Tables are used to supplement the Basic Annals. Treatises mainly record institutions. Hereditary Houses and Biographies are used to record the deeds of families and individuals. These five parts complement each other and form a complete system.

    The majority of "Records of the Grand Historian" are biographies of people. Sima Qian strived to record the lives of ordinary people in his work. In addition to narrating matters related to people's lives in the biographies of emperors, kings, generals and ministers, he also wrote biographies for ordinary people who had significant influence and contributions to social life. In the Records of the Grand Historian, there are biographies of writers, philosophers, famous doctors, as well as biographies of wealthy merchants, assassins, wanderers, and even diviners. Based on the materials he obtained during his travels, Sima Qian also recorded the local customs and economic life of various places. In the "Treatises," Sima Qian extensively introduced regulations and systems, astronomy and calendar calculations, financial economy, and water conservancy projects.

    Due to his own unfortunate experiences and contact with the broad masses of the people, Sima Qian recognized the cruelty of autocratic emperors and understood the suffering of the masses under the exploitation and oppression of the feudal ruling class. These are precisely the deep sources of the popular nature of his thought.

    One of the features of "Records of the Grand Historian" is the exposure of the autocratic tyranny and cruel behavior of representatives of the ruling class. When narrating the history of the Xia and Shang dynasties, Sima Qian described in great detail the cruelty of the famous tyrants Jie and Zhou. Regarding the Qin Dynasty, he not only recorded in detail the tyranny of Qin Shi Huang and the Second Emperor, but also quoted in full his work the "Over Qin Essay" by Jia Yi, which discussed the demise of Qin due to cruelty and violence. Sima Qian bravely recorded how the then ruler, Emperor Wu of Han, was tyrannical and extravagant, and how he foolishly sought immortality. Regarding a great aristocrat, Sima Qian recorded how he extensively occupied fields and gardens. Sima Qian also exposed how he prevented the repair of the Yellow River for his own selfish interests, resulting in years of disasters in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Sima Qian thoroughly exposed how the cruel officials of the time abused punishments and framed innocent people. He did not oppose cracking down on the local powerful people who oppressed the people, but he was disgusted by the tragic killings that involved thousands of families and bloodshed for thousands of miles.

    Sima Qian attached great importance to the great strength of the people and their spirit of resistance. He gave a high evaluation to Chen She, who led the first large-scale peasant war in Chinese history. He said: "Jie and Zhou lost their way and Tang and Wu arose, Zhou lost its way and the Spring and Autumn period arose, Qin lost its government and Chen She emerged." Shang Tang, King Wu of Zhou, and Confucius were "sages" in the minds of people at that time, and Sima Qian raised Chen Sheng to a position parallel to these "sages." This was an extremely bold judgment. Because the great wars, great tours, and great constructions of Emperor Wu of Han caused great suffering to the people, peasant uprisings broke out in the Guandong area at the end of Emperor Wu of Han's reign. Sima Qian recorded in detail the people's spirit of resistance. Despite Emperor Wu of Han's use of various cruel methods to suppress them, the uprising people were not discouraged. The leaders of the uprising were arrested, but the uprising people still insisted on fighting, making the rulers feel helpless.

    In "Records of the Grand Historian," Sima Qian praised those assassins and wanderers who dared to resist tyranny to the death and risked their lives to help others in need. The stories of these heroic figures have long encouraged the fighting spirit of the oppressed people. Sima Qian had a clear distinction between love and hate for oppressors and the oppressed. At that time, the powerful were also called wanderers. Sima Qian admired those wanderers who helped the poor and helped others in need, while he was extremely disgusted with those powerful people who oppressed the people. He said that they were actually no different from thieves and did not deserve to be called heroes. Sima Qian also greatly admired those generals who were willing to share joys and sorrows with their soldiers, and exposed the greed and cruelty of some other generals who did not love their soldiers.

    Sima Qian recorded the history and lives of the peoples surrounding the Han Dynasty. These records are valuable materials for studying the ancient history of many Asian peoples.

    "Records of the Grand Historian" is also one of the typical works of classical Chinese literature. Sima Qian selected typical historical figures and historical events to describe with a high degree of historical and literary accomplishment. He was good at selecting certain typical words and actions of historical figures, and through these, vividly portraying their characters and the characteristics of the social classes they represented. Because of his love for the people and hatred for the tyranny of the feudal ruling class, Sima Qian's works are full of emotion and have a very strong appeal. Sima Qian drew rich vocabulary from the people, therefore, being good at using spoken language to portray the demeanor of characters also became a characteristic of Sima Qian's works.

    Sima Qian was of course limited by the times and influenced by the environment, so "Records of the Grand Historian" also has shortcomings. In some discussions, he still believed in fate. Regarding the measures of Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han, he ignored the positive and beneficial aspects. However, these cannot reduce the great value of "Records of the Grand Historian."

    我国古代伟大的历史家——司马迁
    汪籛
    我国伟大历史学家和文学家司马迁，从诞生到现在已经有二千一百年了。他的宏伟的历史著作和现实主义的文学杰作“史记”，是我国最宝贵的文化遗产之一。司马迁给我国人民带来光荣，世界各国有很多学者研究并推崇他的这部著作。
    司马迁的家乡在今陕西韩城县。他的父亲司马谈长期在汉朝廷里做太史令。这是一个掌管“文史星卜”的小官，并不受人重视。司马迁年轻的时候，一面读书，一面参加耕牧劳动。到二十岁时候，他开始了漫游，踏遍了黄河和长江中下游各地。他到处考察山川、物产、风俗人情并访求古迹。他接触到广大的人民。后来，他做了郎中。这是皇帝的侍卫。他跟随汉武帝走过很多地方，并曾被派到西康、云南一带去同那里的各部落交涉。在他父亲司马谈死后三年，他做了太史令。那时候，汉武帝把搜罗到的大量书籍收藏在皇家的图书馆里，由太史令掌管。司马迁以高度的热情和创造性的劳动，开始从大堆没有经过整理的竹木简和绢书里来搜集史料。由于触犯了汉武帝，司马迁被投进牢狱，受尽了酷吏的磨折和凌辱。他得了死罪。那时候，死罪可以用钱赎免。但是，司马迁是个穷官，他没有钱赎罪。为了完成他要写一部“史记”的理想，他接受了另一种代替死刑的办法，受酷刑中最可耻辱的“腐刑”。这对于他的身体和精神是莫大的摧残。以后，他被汉武帝用做中书令。这个职位是宦官充当的，是一种“扫除之隶，闺阁之臣”。在内心受着痛苦煎熬之下，司马迁坚持写他不朽的著作。他从古籍和现实生活里，搜集了无比丰富的史料，并加以缜密的整理。在死前，他基本上写成了“史记”。
      “史记”纪录了我国从黄帝到汉武帝时候三千年发展的历史。全书共一百三十卷，有五十二万六千五百字。司马迁综合了以往我国史书的各种体例，创造性地把他的著作分作本纪、表、书、世家、列传五个部分。本纪以各代帝王的继承做线索，按年编写，记下最重要的历史事件的纲目。表是用来补充本纪的。书以记述制度为主。世家和列传是用来记述家族和个人的事迹的。这五个部分互相配合，互相补充，构成了一套完整的系统。
    “史记”的大部分是人物的纪传，司马迁力求把普通人民的生活纪录在他的著作里。他除了在帝王将相的纪传里也叙述有关人民生活的事情以外，还替那些对社会生活有重大影响和贡献的一般人作传。在史记里，有文学家、哲学家、著名医生的传，也有巨商、刺客、游侠以至占卜者的传。司马迁还根据他在漫游里得来的材料，纪录了各地的风土人情和经济生活。在“书”里，司马迁广泛地介绍了典章制度、天文历算、财政经济和水利事业。
    由于自己的不幸遭遇，由于接触了广大人民，司马迁认识到专制帝王的残酷，了解到人民群众在封建统治阶级剥削、压迫下所受的痛苦。这些正是他的思想的人民性的深厚来源。
    揭露统治阶级代表们的专制暴政和凶残行为是
  “史记”的特色之一。在叙述夏、商历史的时候，司马迁极其具体地描写了著名暴君桀纣的残酷。对于秦代，他不仅详细地纪录了秦始皇和二世皇帝的暴政，而且把论述秦以酷暴而亡的贾谊“过秦论”全文引在他的著作里。司马迁勇敢地记下了当时的统治者汉武帝如何暴虐奢侈，如何愚昧地想求长生不死。对于一个大贵族，司马迁记录了他怎样广占田园。司马迁还揭露了他如何为一己的私利，阻止修治黄河，以至造成黄河下游连年灾荒的罪恶。司马迁彻底暴露了当时的酷吏怎样滥用刑罚，陷害无辜。他并不反对打击各地欺压人民的豪强，但是他厌恶那种牵连几千家、流血几千里的惨杀。
    司马迁非常重视人民的伟大力量和他们的反抗精神。他对我国历史上第一次领导大规模农民战争的陈涉给了很高的评价。他说：“桀纣失其道而汤武作，周失其道而春秋作，秦失其政而陈涉发迹。”商汤、周武王和孔子在当时人的心目中是“圣人”，司马迁把陈胜提到和这些“圣人”并列的地位。这是一个极大胆的评断。由于汉武帝的大征伐、大巡游和大营建使人民遭受很大的痛苦，到汉武帝末年，关东一带，农民起义爆发了。司马迁详细地纪录了人民的反抗精神。尽管汉武帝用种种残暴的方法去镇压，但是起义的人民并不气馁。起义的领导者被捕了，起义的人民却仍坚持斗争，他们使统治者感到无可奈何。
    在“史记”里，司马迁歌颂了那些敢于誓死反抗强暴和冒生命危险来救人之急的刺客和游侠。这些英雄人物的故事，曾经长期地鼓舞了被压迫的人民的斗争情绪。司马迁对于压迫者同被压迫者是爱憎分明的。当时人把豪强也叫作游侠。司马迁推崇那些救济贫穷、救人之急的游侠，而对那些欺压人民的豪强则极端厌恶。他说，他们实际上同盗贼没有分别，不配称作侠。司马迁还非常推崇那些肯和士兵共甘苦的将领，而对于另一些不爱士兵的将领的贪残则加以揭发。
    司马迁纪述了汉的周围的各族人民的历史和他们的生活。这些记述正是研究亚洲许多民族古代历史的宝贵资料。
    “史记”又是我国古典文学的典型作品之一。司马迁以高度的历史修养和文学修养选择出典型的历史人物和历史事件来描写。他善于选择历史人物的某些典型的言语和行动，通过这些把他们的性格，把他们代表的社会阶层的特点，栩栩如生地刻划出来。由于热爱人民，痛恨封建统治阶级的暴虐，司马迁的作品就洋溢着感情，具有极强烈的感染力。司马迁从人民中间汲取了丰富的词汇，因此，善于运用口语来刻划人物的神态，也成为司马迁作品的特点。
    司马迁当然不能不受时代的限制和环境的影响，因此“史记”也有缺点。在某些论述里，他还相信天命。对于秦始皇汉武帝等人的措施，他忽略了积极有利的一面。但是，这些并不能减低“史记”的巨大价值。
