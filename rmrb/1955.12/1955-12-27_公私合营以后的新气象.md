New Atmosphere After Public-Private Partnership

	Producing More and Better Silk Products for the Country
	The seven filature, silk weaving, and spun silk factories affiliated with the Southwest Silk Company, a public-private joint venture, produced more than 70 times the total value of silk fabrics this year compared to 1950, including both self-produced items and those processed for private factories. All of these silk products are supplied to the domestic market. In addition to producing more than 200,000 meters of silk fabrics this year, the Nanchong Motorized Silk Weaving Factory also produced new products such as silk quilt covers and interwoven satin quilt covers. Over the past few years, these factories have also trained more than 20,000 silk industry workers for the country.
	The total output value of the seven factories affiliated with the Southwest Silk Company, a public-private joint venture, accounts for 90 percent of the total silk industry output value in the entire Southwest region. After these factories implemented public-private joint ownership in 1950, production quickly recovered and developed. The total output value of each factory this year has increased nearly eightfold compared to the first year of joint ownership, and raw silk production has increased more than fivefold. Before 1952, the silk produced by the filature factories rarely reached Grade C. This year, more than 80 percent of the silk is Grade C or above, with Grade A or above reaching 48 percent.
	In the early days of liberation, the factories of the Southwest Silk Company were heavily in debt, their machinery and equipment were old and incomplete, and they lacked working capital, making production very difficult. Since the implementation of public-private joint ownership, the state has transferred a group of administrative and technical cadres to strengthen production technology work and has provided loans to the factories each year to help solve the problem of insufficient working capital. Over the past six years, the state has loaned a total of more than 73 million yuan to the factories. In 1952, the state also invested 2 million yuan to improve the production equipment of the factories. The factories have successively replaced the backward reeling machines with upright reeling machines and added many facilities such as boilers, cocoon boiling, inspection, and silkworm rearing rooms. The Nanchong Motorized Silk Weaving Factory was also expanded. The state has established purchase and sales relationships with the factories, solving the problem of product sales. Thanks to the comprehensive assistance from the state and the active improvement of business management by the factories, the production outlook of each factory has been completely renewed.

  Two Kinds of Exquisite and Inexpensive Clocks Made
	The Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture China Clock Manufacturing Factory has recently successfully trial-produced two kinds of exquisite and inexpensive clocks—a long three-hand luminous back-bell alarm clock and a sitting/hanging dual-purpose luminous clock. The long three-hand alarm clock is now in mass production, and the first batch of 1,000 pieces will be fully calibrated and shipped out of the factory in late December.
	The long three-hand luminous back-bell alarm clock can be used for more than ten years without replacing parts for five years. The price is about 20 percent lower than that of alarm clocks of the same quality.
	The sitting/hanging dual-purpose luminous clock is designed specifically for farmers. It has a simple mechanical structure and accurate timekeeping. According to the design, this clock can also be used for about fifteen years, and the cost is about half that of ordinary alarm clocks. This clock will also be mass-produced soon.

  Ten Advanced Automobile Drivers Emerge
	Ten advanced drivers with more than 200,000 kilometers of safe driving have emerged from the Nanjing Public-Private Joint Venture Jiangnan Automobile Company. The ten cars in the fourth team of the first brigade have driven safely for more than 1,100 days without any liability accidents. As of December 20, drivers Zhang Chunrong and Wei Changyong have both driven safely for more than 222,000 kilometers, setting the highest national record for individual safe driving.
	In the early days of liberation, the drivers of the Jiangnan Automobile Company did not pay attention to safe driving, and their work attitude was not serious. Sometimes they would joke while driving. In 1951, after the Jiangnan Automobile Company became a public-private joint venture, the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China in Jiangnan Automobile Company and the trade union conducted safety education for all employees. Administratively, the speed of the vehicles was regulated according to the road conditions, and working hours were adjusted to ensure that drivers had sufficient rest time. Trade union cadres also established close ties with the people's police to keep abreast of the drivers' implementation of safety operating procedures. In order to enable drivers to concentrate on driving, trade union cadres also paid attention to understanding the drivers' ideological situation and provided timely assistance to those in need.

  Product Quality Has Been Greatly Improved
	The Beijing Public-Private Joint Venture Samsung Pencil Factory was implemented in May 1954. Before the public-private joint venture, the capitalists, in order to pursue profits, consistently produced shoddy goods and were unwilling to accept the suggestions made by the workers regarding the production of high-grade pencils. They focused on buying cheap pencil leads from other places, and even broken pencil leads were used to assemble pencils. As a result, the finished products not only tore paper, broke leads, had unclogged cores, and came unglued, but they even couldn't write. Sales became increasingly narrow. By the end of 1953, the value of the accumulated inferior products in the factory had exceeded the total value of the factory's capital.
	Just after the public-private joint venture was implemented, the capitalists rarely came to the factory. Although the public representatives were not yet familiar with the technology of pencil production, they relied closely on the workers and actively tried to transform the enterprise. They not only added pencil lead-making machinery and equipment according to the workers' opinions but also built new factory buildings. At the same time, they also submitted the planning, quality, and cost indicators to the workers for discussion and implementation. The workers launched a warm competition movement to improve quality. After more than half a year of efforts, the defect rate gradually decreased from 28 percent before the public-private joint venture to the current 4.3 percent. On the basis of improving quality, new products such as color-changing pencils and glass pencils were also trial-produced this year, and research was conducted to increase new specifications and patterns. The ex-factory price of pencils has also been reduced three times successively.

  Capitalists Begin to Live a New Life of Labor
	The capitalists of the Bengbu Public-Private Joint Venture Malt Sugar Factory have begun to live a new life of labor.
	In the workshop of the malt sugar factory, you can see ten capitalists working alongside the workers to press materials, feed materials, and wash materials. Zheng Xingmin used to be engaged in the wholesale business of pigments. Now he has understood the machine performance of the malt sugar workshop and has learned the production technology of mixing raw materials evenly in buckets and applying slurry. Eight capitalists engaged in management work are now gradually familiar with the production situation and are actively studying to improve production. For example, the capitalist Wang Wenzhong, who is now the deputy director of this factory, has successfully researched how to remove impurities from wheat before loading the sugar syrup, so that the output of each pot of sugar syrup is increased by 30 percent compared with the past, and the quality of the sugar syrup is also improved.
	The Public-Private Joint Venture Malt Sugar Factory was formed by the joint operation of the original seven capitalist-run malt sugar factories and absorbed eleven demobilized wholesale commercial capitalists to participate. It was implemented as a public-private joint venture in August of this year. The factory is small in scale and has many management personnel. After the joint venture, the public representatives consulted with the capitalists and appropriately arranged their work according to the specific circumstances and requirements of the capitalists. Among them, eight people were assigned to management positions such as deputy director, deputy section chief, and salesperson, and ten people directly participated in production labor.

    公私合营以后的新气象
    为国家生产更多更好的丝织品
    公私合营西南蚕丝公司所属七个缫丝、织绸和绢纺工厂，今年自制和向私营厂加工的丝织品总产值比一九五零年增加了七十多倍，这些丝绸全部供应国内市场。南充电机织绸厂今年除生产了二十多万公尺丝织品外，还生产了真丝被面、交织缎子被面等新产品。几年来这些工厂还为国家培养了两万多名丝业工人。
    公私合营西南蚕丝公司所属七个工厂的生产总值，占全西南地区丝业总产值的百分之九十。这些工厂从一九五零年实行公私合营以后，生产很快就恢复和发展起来。各厂今年的总产值比合营第一年提高了将近八倍，生丝产量提高了五倍多。一九五二年以前，各缫丝厂所产的丝还很少达到丙级，今年，已经有百分之八十多的丝是丙级以上，其中甲级以上的丝达到百分之四十八。
    西南蚕丝公司各厂解放初期负债累累，机器设备破旧不全，没有流动资金，生产十分困难。自实行公私合营以后，国家抽调了一批行政、技术干部加强生产技术工作，并且逐年贷款给各厂帮助解决缺少流动资金的问题。六年来国家贷给各厂的款项共有七千三百多万元。国家并且在一九五二年投资两百万元，改进各厂生产设备。各厂都先后把落后的座缫车改成了立缫车，增加了锅炉、煮茧、检验、蚕室等许多设备，还将南充电机织绸厂加以扩建。国家同各厂建立了购销关系，解决了产品销路问题。由于国家的全面帮助和各厂的积极改善经营管理，现在各厂的生产面貌已经焕然一新。
  制成两种精美价廉的时钟
    上海市公私合营中国钟表制造厂最近试制成功了两种精美而价廉的时钟——长三针夜光背铃闹钟和坐挂两用夜光钟。长三针闹钟现在已经成批生产，第一批一千只将在十二月下旬全部校准出厂。
    长三针夜光背铃闹钟可以在五年内不换零件，使用期限在十年以上。价格比同样质量的闹钟低百分之二十左右。
    坐挂两用夜光钟是专为农民设计的，机械结构简单，报时准确，这种钟按照设计也可用十五年左右，成本要比普通闹钟约低一半。这种钟不久也将大量生产。
  涌现十位先进汽车司机
    南京市公私合营江南汽车公司涌现了十位安全行车二十万公里以上的先进司机。第一大队四小队的十辆汽车，安全行驶了一千一百多天没有出过任何责任事故。司机张春荣和韦昌勇到十二月二十日止，都已经安全行驶二十二万二千公里以上，创造全国个人安全驾驶的最高纪录。
    江南汽车公司的驾驶人员，在解放初期对安全行车并不重视，工作态度也不严肃，有时一面驾车行驶一面开玩笑。一九五一年，江南汽车公司公私合营后，中共江南汽车公司总支委员会和工会对全体职工进行了安全教育。行政上根据地段情况规定车行速度，并且调整工作时间，保证司机有充足的休息时间。工会干部还和人民警察建立了密切联系，随时了解驾驶人员执行安全操作规程的情况。为了使司机人员能集中精力开车，工会干部还注意了解驾驶人员的思想情况，并且对有困难的人及时给予帮助。
    产品质量有了很大提高
    北京市公私合营三星铅笔厂是在一九五四年五月实行公私合营的。公私合营以前，资方为了追求利润，一贯粗制滥造，不愿接受职工们提出的关于生产高级铅笔的建议，一心到外地买便宜的铅芯，甚至断了的铅芯仍要拿来装笔。结果生产的成品不但拉纸、断铅、通芯、开胶，甚至写不出字。销路越来越窄。到一九五三年底，厂里积压的低劣次品价值已经超过全厂资金的总值。
    刚公私合营以后，资方不常到厂，公股代表虽然对生产铅笔的技术还不熟悉，但是紧紧地依靠了职工，积极想法改造企业。他们不仅根据职工的意见，添置了制铅芯的机器设备，还盖起了新厂房。同时，又把计划、质量、成本指标交给工人讨论执行。职工们展开了热烈的改进质量的竞赛运动。经过半年多的努力，次品率由公私合营前的百分之二十八逐渐降低到目前的百分之四点三。在改进质量的基础上，今年还试制了变色铅笔、玻璃铅笔等新产品，并且研究增加新的规格、花样。铅笔出厂的价格也先后降低了三次。
  资本家开始过劳动的新生活
    蚌埠市公私合营饴糖厂的资本家已经开始过劳动的新生活了。
    在饴糖厂的车间里，可以看到有十个资本家同工人在一道压料、进料和洗料。郑醒民过去是经营颜料批发商业，现在他已经懂得了饴糖车间的机器性能，学会了把原料在桶里搅拌均匀和套浆等生产技术。八个从事管理工作的资本家，现在也逐渐熟悉生产情况，并且积极研究改进生产。如现在担任这个厂副厂长的资本家王文中，他已经研究成功把小麦中的杂物去掉再装糖稀，使每灶糖稀的产量比过去增加百分之三十，同时还提高了糖稀的质量。
    公私合营饴糖厂是由原来七个资本家联营的饴糖厂，吸收了十一个转业的批发商业资本家参加，在今年八月间实行公私合营的。这个厂规模小，管理人员多。合营以后，公股代表同资本家协商，根据资本家的具体情况和要求，适当地安排了他们的工作。其中作副厂长、副课长、销货员等管理工作的有八人，直接参加生产劳动的有十人。
