    Hunan Mobilizes the Masses to Repair Roads and Bridges

    To coordinate with and support the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, various regions in Hunan are actively repairing small rivers, small roads, bridges, and ferry crossings. By the end of October, according to incomplete statistics, the province had repaired approximately 7,000 kilometers of county and township roads, approximately 400 kilometers of simple standard roads, more than 1,500 bridges, more than 1,000 ferry crossings, and cleared reefs and dredged shoals in more than 500 locations on small rivers. The 35-kilometer road from Ningxiang County to Shuangfupu had been in disrepair for many years, making it extremely inconvenient for farmers to carry loads and push carts, and extremely muddy and difficult to travel on during rainy days. In August and September of this year, the local government led the laborers to renovate the road, making it both flat and sturdy, which satisfied the farmers and peddlers who traveled back and forth. After the dredging of the Zishui tributary from Liuduzhai to Taohuaping, the depth and width of the river channel have doubled, which not only ensures the safe navigation of wooden sailing boats, but also increases the load per boat from the original 1.18 tons to 2.8 tons, and shortens the sailing time by 50 percent.

    In the work of repairing small rivers, small roads, bridges, and ferry crossings, various regions have generally correctly implemented the policy of relying on local manpower and financial resources, "using local materials," and "public undertaking with government assistance." In late September, Xiangxiang County renovated the county's district and township roads, and farmers in most townships in each district contributed labor. Under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, they also enthusiastically launched competitions, spending more than 180,000 workdays to renovate a large number of rural roads and bridges.

    湖南发动群众整修道路桥梁
    为了配合和支援农业合作化运动的发展，湖南各地正积极整修小河、小道和桥梁、渡口。到十月底为止，据不完全统计，全省已经整修了县、乡道路约七千公里，简易标准路约四百公里，桥梁一千五百多座，渡口一千多处，小河炸礁、疏滩五百多处。宁乡县由县城到双凫铺的三十五公里大路年久失修，过去农民挑担推车行走极不方便，下雨天更是泥滑难行。今年八、九月间，当地政府领导民工把道路翻修得既平坦，又结实，来往的农民和小贩都很满意。资水支流从六都寨到桃花坪一段经过疏浚后，河道深度、宽度都增加了一倍半，不但保障了木帆船的航行安全，而且每船载量由原来一点一八吨增加到二点八吨，航行时间也缩短了百分之五十。
    各地在整修小河、小道、桥梁和渡口的工作中，一般都正确地执行了依靠当地民力、财力，“就地取材”、“民办公助”的方针。湘乡县九月下旬修整全县区乡道路，各区绝大部分乡的农民群众都出了工。在农业生产合作社、互助组的带动下，他们还热烈开展竞赛，花了十八万多个工作日，就使大量乡村道路、桥梁整修一新。
