Oppose Blindly Merging Factories and Stores and Withdrawing Funds
Guan Datong

Since the Second Meeting of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the industrial and commercial circles in various regions have enthusiastically studied and discussed the relevant documents of the meeting and the People's Daily editorial, further recognizing their bright future of accepting socialist transformation, and expressed their determination to take the socialist road. Many capitalists have submitted applications to the government to accept mergers, reorganizations, and joint state-private ownership. The joint state-private ownership of entire industries is advancing like a wave. This performance by the industrial and commercial circles will naturally be welcomed by the people of the whole country.

However, judging from the situation in Beijing, Jinan, Baoding, and many other places, there are still many private industrialists and businessmen, especially some capitalists of small and medium-sized enterprises, who blindly merge factories and stores, running around everywhere, and merging on their own. Some capitalists of small and medium-sized enterprises feel that their enterprises are backward, and if they do not merge, they are afraid that the "government will not want them" and that they have "no future"; the capitalists of large enterprises believe that adjustments will be made sooner or later, so it is better to "strike first" and "choose freely," finding several factories and stores that are "well-matched," otherwise, if the government guides the merger later, they will not be able to get "everything their way." More seriously, many capitalists of private enterprises take the opportunity to place their relatives, increase salaries, and take the opportunity to use various methods to withdraw funds, turning means of production into means of livelihood, attempting to "make a killing" before the implementation of joint state-private ownership. This phenomenon of blindly merging will cause confusion in social order; and withdrawing funds before the joint state-private ownership of entire industries is an unacceptable behavior.

Merging factories and stores is an important part of the production reorganization and economic reorganization of private industry and commerce. The purpose of the reorganization is to change the original decentralized, backward, and unbalanced state of private industry and commerce according to the principle of large enterprises leading small ones and advanced enterprises leading backward ones, so as to improve and enhance the production and management of the entire industry, in order to arrange and transform them more effectively. This is absolutely different from the mutual annexation and free expansion under the capitalist system. Therefore, the merging of factories and stores must be carried out in a planned and orderly manner in accordance with the requirements of the national plan and in conjunction with the reorganization and joint ventures of entire industries.

The transition from capitalist ownership to socialist public ownership through joint state-private ownership is the bright future for every patriotic and law-abiding industrialist and businessman. It is glorious to abandon one's own selfish and self-interested intentions and gradually transform oneself into a self-reliant worker and staff member in a socialist enterprise. If one only cares about personal "everything their way" or only cares about one's own immediate interests, regardless of the interests of the country and the people, then one is continuing to maintain the decadent capitalist ideology and practices, which is obviously contrary to the country's current policy of transforming capitalist industry and commerce.

The socialist road is broad, and private industrialists and businessmen should see this road clearly, combine their own future with the socialist future of the country, and see not only the present but also the great future. All selfish and self-interested ideas and practices are stumbling blocks on their own path forward.

The acts of blindly merging and withdrawing funds should attract the attention of party and government leaders in various places, strengthen education for the industrial and commercial circles, and clarify their confused thoughts. At the same time, it is also necessary to prevent and correct the practice of cadres in certain government departments who arbitrarily investigate and withdraw funds and investigate off-book funds and properties without approval, as this will only fuel the confusion.

    反对盲目并厂并店和抽逃资金
    管大同
    中华全国工商业联合会执行委员会第二次会议以后，各地工商界都热烈地学习和讨论了会议的有关文件和人民日报的社论，进一步认清了自己接受社会主义改造的光明前途，纷纷表示走社会主义道路的决心，有许多资本家向政府提出了接受合并、改组和公私合营的申请。全行业的公私合营正像海浪一样向前发展。工商界的这种表现，自然会受到全国人民的欢迎。
    但是，从北京、济南、保定等许多地方的情况来看，目前还有不少私营工商业者，特别是一些中小企业的资本家，盲目地并厂并店，到处奔走，自行合并。一些中小企业的资本家觉得自己的企业落后，如果不合并起来，怕“政府不要”，怕“没有前途”；大型企业的资本家则认为迟早要调整，不如“先下手为强”，可以“自由选择”，找几个“门当户对”的厂店，否则等以后由政府来指导合并，就不能“事事如意”了。更严重的是有不少私营企业的资本家趁机安插私人，提高薪资，趁机采用各种方式来抽逃资金，变生产资料为生活资料，企图在实行公私合营前“捞一把”。这种盲目合并的现象将会造成社会秩序的混乱；而趁全行业公私合营前抽逃资金，更是不能容许的行为。
    并厂并店是私营工商业生产改组和经济改组的一项重要内容。改组的目的是要根据以大带小、以先进带落后的原则来改变私营工商业原来那种分散落后和不平衡的状态，提高和改进整个行业的生产和经营，以便更有效地对它们进行安排和改造。这和在资本主义制度下的互相吞并、自由扩张是绝对不相同的。所以，并厂并店必须根据国家计划的要求，结合全行业的改组、合营，有领导有秩序地进行。
    由资本家所有制经过公私合营向社会主义全民所有制过渡，这是每一个爱国守法的工商业者的光明前途。放弃自己自私自利的打算，逐步改变自己成为一个自食其力的劳动者和社会主义企业里的工作人员，是很光荣的。如果只顾个人“事事如意”，或者只顾自己的眼前利益，而不管国家和人民的利益，就是继续保持腐朽的资本主义的思想和做法，显然是同国家当前改造资本主义工商业的政策相违背的。
    社会主义道路是广阔的，私营工商业者应当看清这条道路，把自己的前途同国家的社会主义前途结合在一起，不仅要看到现在，而且更要看到伟大的将来。一切自私自利的想法和做法都是自己前进道路上的绊脚石。
    盲目合并和抽逃资金的行为，应当引起各地党政领导的注意，加强对工商界的教育，澄清他们的混乱思想。同时，也要防止和纠正政府某些部门的干部，不经批准，任意查抽逃资金、查账外资财的做法，这样，只会助长混乱。
