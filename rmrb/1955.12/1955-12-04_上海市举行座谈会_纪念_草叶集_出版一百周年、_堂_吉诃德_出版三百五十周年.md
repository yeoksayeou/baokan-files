    The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers Association jointly held a symposium on the 2nd to commemorate the centenary of the publication of the world-renowned "Leaves of Grass" and the 350th anniversary of the publication of "Don Quixote." More than 40 writers, poets, directors, actors, and literary and art workers participated in the symposium.
    The symposium was presided over by Jin Zhonghua, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. Ba Jin, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers Association, gave a report at the meeting on commemorating these two immortal works of the world. He said that these two works have been constantly persecuted, cursed, and distorted by the ruling classes and reactionary forces of their own countries since their publication, but they have always radiated a brilliant and dazzling light, becoming part of the precious cultural heritage of the people of the world. In his report, Ba Jin also elaborated on the content and spirit of "Leaves of Grass" and "Don Quixote," as well as the life stories of the authors Walt Whitman and Miguel de Cervantes. After the symposium, actors from the Shanghai People's Art Theater recited excerpts from the works of Whitman and Cervantes. (Our correspondent in Shanghai)
