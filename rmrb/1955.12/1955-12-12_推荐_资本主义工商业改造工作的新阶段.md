Recommendation: "A New Stage in the Socialist Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce"
Guan Datong

    "A New Stage in the Socialist Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce" is a compilation of documents from the Second Meeting of the First Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Under the care and guidance of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, this meeting focused on discussing the issue of further promoting the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. The book includes the People's Daily editorial of November 22, 1955, "Unify Understanding, Make Overall Plans, and Conscientiously Carry Out the Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce," Chairman Mao's symposium with members of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the opening speech of the meeting, Vice Premier Chen Yun's report on the transformation of private industry and commerce, Vice Premier Chen Yi's report to the Second Meeting of the First Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the telegram of respect from the Second Meeting of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce to Chairman Mao, the meeting's "Letter to the National Industrial and Commercial Circles," and thirteen documents including the meeting's resolutions. This is a collection of documents with significant guiding and educational significance for studying and implementing the state's policy on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce during the transition period.
    This year, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country has begun to enter a new stage of development. The characteristics marking this new stage are the advancement from processing, ordering, distribution, and agency sales of capitalist industry and commerce and the individual implementation of joint state-private ownership, to the separate implementation of full or large-scale joint state-private ownership in many industries and regions, from the primary and intermediate forms of state capitalism to the advanced form of state capitalism. This new stage has developed on the basis of the work of the past few years and is urgently needed to adapt to the situation of the accelerated progress of socialist construction in our country. At present, the socialist economy has established an absolute advantage in our national economy, capitalist industry and commerce have been basically incorporated into the track of state capitalism, a group of progressive core members has emerged among the national bourgeoisie, and more and more private industrialists and businessmen are actively accepting socialist transformation. This means that in our country during the transition period, under the strong people's democratic government led by the working class and under favorable international conditions, it is entirely possible to transform capitalist industry and commerce through peaceful means; according to the current political and economic development situation, it is entirely necessary and timely to advance the work of transforming capitalist industry and commerce to a new stage.
    However, does the fact that we can transform capitalist industry and commerce through peaceful means mean that everything is "going smoothly"? No, it doesn't. Gradually replacing capitalist ownership with socialist public ownership is still a profound and complex class struggle. It is wrong to think that there is no struggle or to lose the necessary vigilance. We know that during the transition period, the policies of the Party and the state are not only to transform capitalist enterprises into socialist enterprises, but also to transform the vast majority of the bourgeoisie from exploiters into self-reliant socialist laborers and into staff members of socialist enterprises through education. Therefore, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is not only an economic task but also a political task; it is not an easy task, but a major social transformation; it is an important component of the state's general task during the transition period and is a major event of world significance. At present, there are still many people, even many cadres, who are not only vague in their understanding of the issue of transforming capitalist industry and commerce but also show an extremely indifferent attitude. As the "People's Daily" editorial of November 22 pointed out: "Today's more important problem is that the work of the Party and the People's Government in transforming capitalist industry and commerce is still far from adequate and lags behind the needs and possibilities. Both within the Communist Party, within the working class, and within the industrial and commercial circles, the propaganda and education work on transforming capitalist industry and commerce has been done too little, and many ideological confusions have not been clarified. At the same time, the actual work of transforming capitalist industry and commerce has not aroused the universal attention of the relevant departments and all localities and cities across the country."
    This collection of documents should become one of the important documents for various organizations, groups, and the broad masses of people to study the state's principles and policies on transforming capitalist industry and commerce and transforming bourgeois elements. Relevant staff should read and discuss it carefully. It should be pointed out that at present, among the cadres of our Party and state organs, there are still some people who are unwilling to come into contact with issues concerning the bourgeoisie; they are afraid or disdain to approach capitalists, do not like to read articles about the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and do not study the state's policies toward the bourgeoisie. They have adopted a closed-door attitude toward these issues. This closed-door attitude actually does not believe that the Party, the state, and the working class have the power to transform bourgeois elements through education, and this is an intolerable passive attitude toward the state's general task during the transition period. Among the workers and staff in private enterprises, there are also some people who, although they support and enthusiastically implement the state's various measures for transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and although they actively struggle against various illegal activities of capitalists, still have a unclear understanding of the principles and policies for transforming capitalist industry and commerce and the future direction of the bourgeoisie, and therefore there are rightist and "leftist" deviations of varying degrees in their work. Many documents in this book provide systematic analysis of the principles and policies for transforming capitalist industry and commerce, such as the policy of peaceful transformation, the policy of redemption, overall planning, and specific policies and measures such as industry-wide joint state-private ownership, economic reorganization, and fixed interest rates. These documents are good teaching materials for cadres of various financial and economic organs, trade union cadres of enterprises, and the broad masses of workers and staff.
    Under the guidance of Chairman Mao and relevant responsible comrades of the Central Committee, the Second Meeting of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce focused on discussing the issue of the transformation of bourgeois individuals. In the opening speech of Chairman Chen Shutong entitled "Adapt to the Situation of the Development of the National Socialist Economic Construction and Strive to Further Promote the Active Acceptance of Socialist Transformation by Industrialists and Businessmen Across the Country," based on the instructions of Chairman Mao, he emphasized how bourgeois elements should grasp their own destiny, how to combine the future of the country and themselves, how to love the country and abide by the law, study the laws of social development, and carry out ideological transformation, how to gradually transform from exploiters into laborers, and how to cultivate advanced core members and give play to the important role of core members in the transformation, all of which were analyzed in a relatively in-depth manner. At this meeting, many people from industrial and commercial circles made self-examinations and self-criticisms, and further recognized their future. In the telegram of respect from the meeting to Chairman Mao, it said: "Each of us has earnestly studied and discussed your teachings to us at the symposium with unparalleled gratitude and excitement, which has given us an unprecedented and profound education, further clarified our future, strengthened our confidence, and increased our strength." "Every word of yours has penetrated our hearts, making us moved and ashamed." Based on this understanding, the meeting discussed and published the "Letter to the National Industrial and Commercial Circles," which made a profound analysis and explanation of the various ideological problems existing in the industrial and commercial circles at that time. It called on the national industrial and commercial circles to "work hard to study, constantly change old ideas, accept new ideas, change old lives, accept new lives, and transform themselves into good citizens of socialist society"; it called on the national industrial and commercial circles to "closely follow the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and march with full confidence towards the prosperous and happy socialist goal together with the people of the whole country." Undoubtedly, the earnest study of these documents by the industrial and commercial circles will surely help to enhance confidence, relieve depression, improve understanding, and promote the cause of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce to move forward by leaps and bounds.

    推荐“资本主义工商业改造工作的新阶段”
    管大同
    “资本主义工商业改造工作的新阶段”是中华全国工商业联合会第一届执行委员会第二次会议的文件汇编。这次会议在中共中央和毛泽东主席的关怀和指导之下，着重地讨论了进一步开展资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作的问题。本书中包括了人民日报一九五五年十一月二十二日“统一认识，全面规划，认真地做好改造资本主义工商业的工作”的社论，毛主席邀工商联执委会委员座谈，会议的开幕词，陈云副总理作私营工商业改造问题的报告，陈毅副总理向工商联第一届执委会第二次会议作报告，全国工商联执委会第二次会议向毛主席致敬电，会议的“告全国工商界书”和会议决议等十三篇文件。对于学习和贯彻国家在过渡时期对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造政策来说，这是一本有重大的指导意义和教育意义的文集。
    我国资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，今年已经开始走上一个新的发展的阶段。标志着这一新阶段的特征的，是从对资本主义工商业进行加工订货、经销代销和个别地实行公私合营，推进到在许多行业中、在各地方分别地实行全部或大部公私合营，从国家资本主义的初级和中级形式，推进到国家资本主义的高级形式。这一新的阶段是在过去几年的工作基础上发展起来的，是适应当前我国社会主义建设的加速进展的形势所迫切需要的。目前社会主义经济已经在我国国民经济中树立了绝对的优势，资本主义工商业已经基本上被纳入了国家资本主义的轨道，民族资产阶级中已经出现了一批进步核心分子，已有愈来愈多的私营工商业者积极接受社会主义改造。这就是说，在我国过渡时期，在工人阶级领导的强大的人民民主政权和有利的国际条件下，通过和平的道路改造资本主义工商业是完全可能的；根据当前的政治、经济的发展情况，把改造资本主义工商业的工作推进到一个新的阶段是完全必要的，也是适时的。
    但是，我们有可能通过和平的道路来改造资本主义工商业，是不是说，一切都“万事大吉”了呢？不是的。逐步用社会主义全民所有制来代替资本家所有制，仍然是一场深刻的、复杂的阶级斗争。认为没有斗争，或者丧失了应有的警惕，都是不对的。我们知道，在过渡时期，党和国家的政策，不但要把资本主义企业改造成为社会主义企业，而且要把资产阶级中的绝大多数人用教育的方法从剥削者改造成为自食其力的、社会主义的劳动者，改造成为社会主义企业里的工作人员。因而，对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造不只是经济工作，同时也是政治工作；不是一件轻而易举的事情，而是一个重大的社会变革；是国家在过渡时期总任务的一个重要的组成部分，是具有世界意义的一件大事。现在还有很多的人，甚至有很多的干部，不只对改造资本主义工商业的问题在认识上模糊，而且表现了极端不重视的态度。正如十一月二十二日“人民日报”的社论所指出的：“今天的更重要的问题是在：党和人民政府在改造资本主义工商业方面的工作还做得很不够，还落在需要和可能的后面。无论在共产党内，在工人阶级内和在工商界内，关于改造资本主义工商业的宣传教育工作还做得很少，许多思想上的混乱还没有得到澄清。同时，改造资本主义工商业的实际工作也没有引起各有关部门和全国各地方各城市的普遍重视。”
    这本文集应当成为各机关、各团体和广大人民群众学习国家改造资本主义工商业和改造资产阶级分子的方针政策的重要文件之一。有关的工作人员应该认真地阅读和讨论。应当指出，现时在我们的党和国家机关干部中，还有一部分人是不愿意接触关于资产阶级的问题的，他们害怕或不屑于和资本家接近，不爱读有关工商联的文章，不研究国家对资产阶级的政策。他们对这些问题采取了关门主义的态度。这种关门主义的态度，实际上是不相信党、国家和工人阶级有力量可以用教育的方法改造资产阶级分子，这是对于国家在过渡时期的总任务采取了不可容忍的消极态度。在私营企业的工人和职员群众中，也有一部分人，他们虽然拥护并热烈地执行国家对资本主义工商业进行改造的各项措施，虽然对资本家的各种违法行为积极地进行着斗争，但他们对改造资本主义工商业的方针政策，对资产阶级的未来方向，还有认识不清的，因而在工作中存在着不同程度的右的和“左”的偏向。这本书的许多文件，对改造资本主义工商业的方针政策问题，诸如和平改造方针、赎买政策、全面规划，以及关于全行业公私合营、经济改组、定息等具体政策和措施，都有系统的分析。这些文件是各财经机关的干部、企业的工会干部和广大的职工群众的很好教材。
    这次全国工商联执行委员会会议，在毛主席和中央有关负责同志的指导下，着重地讨论了资产阶级个人的改造问题。在陈叔通主任委员的题为“适应国家的社会主义经济建设发展的形势，为进一步推动全国工商业者积极接受社会主义改造而奋斗”的开幕词中，根据毛主席的指示，着重地提出了资产阶级分子怎样掌握自己的命运，怎样把国家和自己的前途结合起来，怎样爱国守法，学习社会发展的规律，进行思想改造，怎样由剥削者逐步转变成为劳动者，以及怎样培养先进核心分子，发挥核心分子在改造中的重要作用等都作了比较深透地分析。在这次会议中，许多工商界人士作了自我检查和自我批评，进一步认识了自己的前途。在会议向毛主席的致敬电中说：“我们每个人都以无比感激和万分兴奋的心情，认真地学习和讨论了您在座谈会上对我们的教导，使我们受到了一次空前的、深刻的教育，进一步看清了前途，坚定了信心，增加了力量。”“您的每一句话都深入我们的心坎，使我们感动，也使我们惭愧”。在这一认识的基础上，会议讨论和发表了“告全国工商界书”，针对着当前工商界思想上存在的各种问题，做了深刻的分析和解释。号召全国工商界“努力学习，不断地改变旧思想，接受新思想，改变旧生活，接受新生活，把自己改造成为社会主义社会的良好公民”；号召全国工商界“紧紧地跟着伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导，满怀信心地同全国人民一道，向着繁荣幸福的社会主义目标迈进”。无疑地，工商界认真地学习这些文件，必然会有助于增强信心，解除苦闷，提高认识，使资本主义工商业社会主义改造的事业大踏步地向前推进。
