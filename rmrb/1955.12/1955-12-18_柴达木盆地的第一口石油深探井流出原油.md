Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 17th: The first deep oil exploration well drilled in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province recently produced crude oil during the drilling process.

	Before dawn on the 12th, the drilling workers had just completed the casing operation and were waiting for the cement injected into the well to solidify when they suddenly heard bubbling sounds from the wellhead. At this time, a strong smell of oil filled the air above the wellhead, and then crude oil flowed out from the well. By noon on the 13th, the drilling workers had collected more than 600 liters of crude oil in barrels. The crude oil is of good quality. Analysts have taken samples for analysis.

	The news that oil was quickly found in this exploration well greatly encouraged the drilling workers. They expressed their determination to drill quickly and strive to completely drill into the main oil-bearing layer as soon as possible.

    柴达木盆地的第一口石油深探井流出原油
    新华社西宁十七日电　青海省柴达木盆地不久前开钻的第一口石油深探井，在钻进过程中流出了原油。
    十二日黎明前，钻井工人刚下完套管，在等待注入井内的水泥凝固，突然听到井口传来了气泡声。这时候，井口上空弥漫着一股浓烈的油味，接着就有原油从井下流出来。到十三日午间，钻井工人收集在桶内的原油已达六百多公升。原油质量良好。化验人员已取出样品进行分析。
    这口探井迅速见油的消息，大大地鼓舞了钻井工人。他们表示要快速钻进，争取早日完全钻到主要含油层。
