Huaibei Salt Field Builds Electric Pumping Station

The state-owned Huaibei Salt Field is building an electric pumping station. This project fully commenced in mid-October and is expected to be completed and put into production by the end of January next year.

This electric pumping station is being built on the coast of Fengdun in Huaibei Salt Field. The entire project includes two diversion canals, a reservoir, a river-crossing culvert, a control gate, a pumping machine room, and a high-voltage transmission line of more than 30 kilometers. Currently, more than 5,000 migrant workers, construction workers, and engineering technicians are working intensely on the construction.

After the electric pumping station is completed, its pumping capacity will be equivalent to 300 windmills, with 12,000 cubic meters of seawater flowing to more than 40 work areas in the three salt production plants every hour. After the electric pumping station officially starts production, the Huaibei Salt Field can increase its annual salt production by 2.4 million dan. (Feng Tongzhi)

    淮北盐场兴建电力扬水站
    国营淮北盐场正在兴建一座电力扬水站。这项工程已在十月中旬全面开工，预计明年一月底建成并投入生产。
    这座电力扬水站，建筑在淮北盐场封?的海边。全部工程包括二导水沟、蓄水池、穿河涵洞、节制闸、扬水机器房和一条三十多公里长的高压输电线等。目前，五千多个民工、建筑工人和工程技术员正在紧张施工。
    这座电力扬水站建成后，它的扬水能力相当于三百辆风车，每小时将有一万二千立方公尺的海水流向三个制盐场的四十多个工区里去。这座电力扬水站正式开工生产后，淮北盐场每年可以增产二百四十万担盐。　（冯同智）
