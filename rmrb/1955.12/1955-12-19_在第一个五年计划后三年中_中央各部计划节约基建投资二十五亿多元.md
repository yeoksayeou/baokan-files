Xinhua News Agency, December 18th – In accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council regarding practicing strict economy, central ministries, provinces (municipalities), and autonomous regions have generally formulated plans to save capital construction investment in the last three years of the First Five-Year Plan. According to incomplete statistics, from 1955 to 1957, the central ministries alone will save over 2.55 billion yuan in state investment, of which more than two-thirds will be saved from non-productive projects.

The main areas for central ministries, provinces (municipalities), and autonomous regions to save capital construction investment in the last three years of the First Five-Year Plan are to vigorously reduce the excessively high cost of construction projects, especially non-productive projects, to reduce the number of non-productive projects that were originally planned to be built excessively or too early, and to reduce the number of machinery and tools purchased. According to preliminary estimates by the State Planning Commission, of the total investment saved by the central ministries in three years, investment saved from reducing the cost of construction projects, reducing the number of machinery and tools purchased, and reducing transportation costs accounts for more than 75 percent, and investment saved from reducing unnecessary projects accounts for about 25 percent. Central ministries, provinces (municipalities), and autonomous regions have all formulated specific measures in their savings plans to ensure the realization of the plans.

In conjunction with the formulation of savings plans, central ministries, provinces (municipalities), and autonomous regions have generally adjusted the capital construction plans for 1955 to 1957. Although the adjusted capital construction plans have reduced a large amount of state investment, the key construction projects and the production capacity of major products stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan have not been reduced, and a number of new construction projects have been added. This makes the capital construction plans for the last three years of the First Five-Year Plan more rational, creating favorable conditions for completing the First Five-Year Plan.

    在第一个五年计划后三年中
    中央各部计划节约基建投资二十五亿多元
    新华社十八日讯　根据中共中央和国务院关于厉行节约的指示，中央各部、各省（市）和自治区已经普遍订出第一个五年计划后三年节约基本建设投资的计划。根据不完全统计，从一九五五年到一九五七年，仅中央各部就将节约国家投资二十五亿五千多万元，其中三分之二以上是从非生产性工程中节约下来的。
    中央各部、各省（市）和自治区在第一个五年计划后三年节约基本建设投资的主要方面，是大力降低建筑工程主要是非生产性工程过高的造价，削减原计划过多、过早建设的非生产性工程项目，以及减少机械和工具的购置数量等。根据国家计划委员会初步估算，中央各部在三年内节约的投资总数中、从降低建筑工程造价、减少机械和工具购置数量以及减少运杂费等方面节约的投资占百分之七十五以上，从削减不必要的工程项目节约的投资占百分之二十五左右。中央各部、各省（市）和自治区在节约计划中都拟订出具体的措施，保证计划的实现。
    中央各部、各省（市）和自治区结合制定节约计划，普遍调整了一九五五年到一九五七年的基本建设计划。调整以后的基本建设计划虽然减少了大批国家投资，但是第一个五年计划中所规定的重点建设工程和主要产品的生产能力都没有减少，并且增加了一批新的建设项目。这样就使第一个五年计划后三年的基本建设计划更加合理，为完成第一个五年计划创造了有利的条件。
