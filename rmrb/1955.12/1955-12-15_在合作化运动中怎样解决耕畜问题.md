How to Solve the Problem of Draught Animals in the Cooperative Movement
Li Feng, Secretary of the CPC Huimin Prefectural Committee, Shandong Province

After the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives in Huimin Prefecture, Shandong, there was once a serious situation of increased livestock market supply, falling prices, and reduced transaction volume. Calves that used to sell for more than 30 yuan were only selling for about 20 yuan at that time; in some places, you could buy a calf for two or three yuan. This situation caused unrest and directly affected production. The reasons for this situation were: on the one hand, some cooperatives were willing to have large and strong draught animals, but unwilling to have young livestock. The members felt that they could not earn wages by raising young livestock, and fodder was difficult to obtain, so it was better to sell them; on the other hand, some well-off middle peasants were afraid of losing out when draught animals entered the cooperative, so they sold them before joining the cooperative under the pretext of lacking fodder. Some cooperatives, in order to assess the price of draught animals entering the cooperative, took the draught animals to the market for valuation, which indirectly increased the supply of livestock on the market and had an adverse effect on livestock prices.

After the prefectural committee discovered this situation, it immediately made specific arrangements for the protection of draught animals according to the instructions of the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee, requiring all counties to pay special attention to solving the problem of draught animals while rectifying and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives and carrying out winter plowing. All counties also made specific studies at meetings of party activists. After a period of work, the livestock markets in most areas gradually returned to normal, the supply of draught animals gradually decreased, and prices gradually increased. The number of livestock marketed in Huimin County decreased from 5,500 in September to 2,590 in October. The number of livestock marketed in Beizhen, Bin County, decreased from 1,038 in September to 570 in October. The price of young livestock generally increased by 20% to 30%, and the price of strong livestock generally increased by about 15%. Farmers buying draught animals also slightly increased.

How was the problem of draught animals solved in the Huimin area?

In the past, farmers in the Huimin area had the habit of "selling in winter and buying in spring," mainly because they believed that there were few production opportunities in winter and no need for livestock. With the development of the cooperative movement and the arrival of a new production upsurge, this view was no longer suitable for the current new situation, but many leaders of cooperatives and farmers still followed the old habits and blindly sold livestock in winter. Therefore, to solve the problem of draught animals, we must first solve this ideological problem, use facts to educate the backbone of cooperatives and members to understand this new situation, and make them understand that with the development of cooperation, the increase in winter production opportunities, draught animals are not only not surplus, but also insufficient; then, on this basis, help each cooperative to make a unified plan for developing production and protecting livestock. All counties, at meetings of party activists (attended by both old and new cooperative directors), helped the directors find ways to tap potential, and formulate preliminary production plans for each cooperative, and based on this plan, arranged agricultural work and animal power to organize production and set off a winter production upsurge. This not only overcame the farmers' idea of "winter idleness" and promoted production, but also provided outlets for all sizes of livestock, reversing the habit of "selling in winter and buying in spring." For example, Sijia Township in Guangrao County has 480 draught animals. In order to realize next year's production increase plan, 70 draught animals were used to water wheat in winter, 54 were used to transport coal to prepare for brick-making and well-digging, 20 were used for grinding, and the remaining 336 were also arranged, so that no livestock were idle throughout the winter. Pengli Township in the Second District of Bin County used to be a cotton-producing area with "little agricultural work and many draught animals in winter." Now, this township has formulated a plan to increase grain production by 250,000 jin next year, and this winter it will pull sand to improve 230 mu of red soil and reclaim 1,000 mu of wasteland, so that all 180 draught animals will be fully utilized, completely changing the old habit of "selling in winter and buying in spring." This township not only preserved all existing draught animals, but also plans to raise more than 60 more.

Cooperatives that adopt the method of private ownership and public use of draught animals generally make comprehensive arrangements for the agricultural work in the cooperative and the existing draught animals, so that all types of draught animals can play a role, changing the past practice of only renting large draught animals and not renting small draught animals. Guangrao County adopted the "four fixed" methods, namely: fixing grade, fixing time, fixing price, and fixing responsibility. According to the size and strength of the draught animals, different grades are determined; according to the agricultural work in the cooperative, the time, remuneration, and responsibility for illness, injury, and death of each type of draught animal are determined. In this way, the concerns of the livestock owners that "using the cattle less and not earning enough to raise the cattle" and "the rent is low and it is a loss to feed the cattle" are dispelled, and the enthusiasm of the members to raise cattle is encouraged.

Cooperatives that adopt the method of valuing draught animals and turning them into public ownership generally control the price of draught animals at a level lower than the spring price and higher than the current price or at the average annual price, given the current low price of livestock. It is clearly stipulated that the repayment period should be cleared within three years, and the annual repayment ratio should be determined according to the cooperative's repayment ability. Because some livestock owners are afraid that the draught animal price will be repaid in small amounts every year, which is not useful, the repayment method generally adopts the method of concentrating the payment to one or several households at a time according to the urgency of the livestock owners' needs, and fixing it with a contract.

Jointly raising young livestock is a method of voluntary combination. Local experiences have shown that jointly raising young livestock is the basic method to protect young livestock, which not only overcomes the difficulties of raising young livestock, but also solves the needs of members for pushing mills, walking relatives, and other aspects of life. In the organization of joint raising, various localities have carried out education on the importance of protecting young livestock for the development of production, and specifically calculated the benefits of raising young livestock for production and for individuals, which has increased the enthusiasm of members to raise young livestock. In Yulin Township, Putai County, after such education and calculation, the original young livestock were completely preserved, and 11 more were raised. The phenomenon of "excluding the old and weak and not wanting the young" was eliminated.

The methods to solve the problem of fodder are: arranging the grass demand and grass sources of publicly and privately raised livestock in the cooperative, tapping potential, and widely collecting fodder; organizing the exchange of firewood for grass, and making full use of the available fodder. For example, the 11 agricultural production cooperatives in Pengli Township, the Second District of Bin County, have a total of 180 draught animals, which require more than 970,000 jin of grass per year. The existing cattle grass in these cooperatives is only enough for five and a half months. If more draught animals are raised, the fodder will be even more insufficient. They further arranged the sources of grass, used more than 340,000 jin of corn stalks that can be used as fodder for fodder, and cut 240,000 jin of grass in Kenli, which completely overcame the difficulty of insufficient fodder.

At present, although the price of livestock in the Huimin area has been initially stabilized in most areas, there is still a serious imbalance between areas. On the one hand, some areas that take livestock raising as a sideline (such as Wudi County) have more livestock reproduction and cannot find a way out. Some severely affected areas and several concentrated cotton-producing areas still overemphasize the difficulty of raising livestock and do not actively do a good job in protecting livestock. The livestock problem in these areas is still very tense. On the other hand, although some preliminary experience in protecting livestock has been obtained in general areas, it has not been seriously summarized and universally promoted. In particular, winter plowing, livestock protection, and grain "three fix" to households are all being carried out intensively, and some places have already shown a phenomenon of losing sight of the other. If draught animals are not properly arranged, there may still be a danger of selling a batch of draught animals after the winter plowing is basically completed. Therefore, the prefectural committee recently requested all counties to conduct a further in-depth inspection of the livestock market and price situation; to conduct another study of the situation of villages and agricultural production cooperatives with tense livestock problems, find out the crux of the problem, and quickly solve it. At the same time, we must seriously summarize the existing experience and universally promote it. In counties with fewer draught animals such as Gaoqing, Qidong, Guangrao, Lijin, and Huantai, supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives should be organized to sign contracts to purchase a part of draught animals from Wudi County, adjust the surplus and deficiency in a planned and step-by-step manner, and eliminate the tense state of the livestock problem.

    在合作化运动中怎样解决耕畜问题
    中共山东省惠民地委书记　李峰
    山东惠民专区农业生产合作社大量发展以后，曾经一度出现牲畜上市量增加、价格下降、交易量减少的严重情况。过去三十多元的牛犊当时只卖到二十来元；有的地方二、三元就能买头小牛。这种情况使得人心动荡，直接影响了生产。产生这种情况的原因：一方面是部分合作社愿意要大耕畜、壮耕畜，不愿要幼小牲畜，社员感到喂小牲畜挣不到工资，草料又困难，不如卖出；另一方面是有些富裕中农怕耕畜入社吃亏，在入社前借口没有草料把耕畜卖掉。有些合作社为了评定入社耕畜的价格，把耕畜牵到集上去估价，无形中增加了牲畜的上市量，给市场上的牲畜价格以不良影响。
    地委发现这种情况后，即根据中共山东省委的指示，具体布置了保护耕畜的工作，要求各县在整顿巩固农业生产合作社、开展冬耕生产中，特别注意解决耕畜问题。各县在党的活动分子会议上也都作了具体的研究。经过一段时期的工作，绝大部分地区的牲畜市场都渐趋正常，耕畜上市量逐渐减少，价格也逐渐提高。惠民县九月份上市五千五百头，十月份减为二千五百九十头。滨县北镇九月份上市一千零三十八头，十月份减为五百七十头。幼畜价格一般提高了百分之二十至三十，壮畜价格一般提高百分之十五左右。农民买耕畜的也略有增加。
    惠民地区的耕畜问题是怎样解决的呢？
    过去惠民地区的农民对牲口有“冬卖春买”的习惯，主要是认为冬季生产门路少，用不着牲口。随着合作化运动的发展，新的生产高潮的到来，这种看法本来已经不适合当前新的情况，但是有很多合作社的领导人员和农民仍照老习惯办事，在冬季还是盲目出卖牲口。因此，要解决耕畜问题，首先就要解决这种思想问题，用事实教育合作社的骨干和社员认识这种新形势，使他们了解，随着合作化的发展，冬季生产门路的增多，耕畜不仅不过剩，而且还不够用；然后在这个基础上帮助各社把发展生产和保护牲畜作出统一规划。各县都在党的活动分子会议上（新老社长都参加了），帮助社长找窍门、挖潜力，订出各社的初步生产规划，并且依据这个规划，将农活和畜力加以排队，组织生产，掀起冬季生产高潮。这样既克服了农民“冬闲”思想，推动了生产，又使大小牲口都有出路，扭转“冬卖春买”的习惯。如：广饶县司家乡有四百八十头耕畜，为了实现明年的增产计划，用七十头耕畜冬浇小麦，五十四头运炭准备烧砖打井，二十头拉磨，其余三百三十六头也都作了安排，整个冬季没有一头牲口闲着。滨县二区彭李乡过去是“冬季农活少、耕畜多”的产棉地区。现在这个乡制定了明年增产二十五万斤粮食的计划，今冬要拉沙土改良红土二百三十亩，开荒一千亩，这样就把一百八十头耕畜全部运用起来，彻底改变了“冬卖春买”的老习惯。这个乡不仅把现有耕畜全部保住了，而且还打算再增养六十多头。
    对耕畜采取私有公用办法的社，一般是把社里的农活和现有耕畜进行全面安排，使各类耕畜都能够发挥作用，改变过去只租大耕畜不租小耕畜的做法。广饶县采取了“四定”的办法，即：定等级，定时间，定价格，定责任。按照耕畜大小强弱，分别定出等级；根据社里的农活，分别定出各类耕畜使用的时间、报酬和病伤死亡的责任。这样，打破了畜主怕“用牛少，养牛不够本”和“租价低，喂牛吃亏”的顾虑，鼓励了社员养牛的积极性。
    对耕畜采用折价归公办法的社，在当前牲口价格较低的情况下，各地一般掌握了低于春季高于现价或按周年平均价格的办法来评定耕畜价格。在偿还期限上都明确规定三年还清，并且根据社的偿还能力，确定每年的偿还比数。由于有的畜主怕每年零零碎碎地还的耕畜价款，不顶用，在偿还办法上，一般是采取根据畜主需要的缓急，把款集中还一户或几户，一次还清的办法，并且用合同固定下来。
    幼畜伙养，是采取自愿结合的办法。各地经验都说明了，伙养幼畜是保护幼畜的基本办法，这样既克服了喂养幼畜的困难，又解决了社员推碾磨、走亲友等生活上的需要问题。在组织伙养中，各地对群众进行了保护幼畜对发展生产的重要性的教育，并具体算清喂养幼畜对生产对个人有利的账，提高了社员喂养幼畜的积极性。蒲台县榆林乡，经过这样教育算账的结果，原有的幼畜完全保住了，还增养了十一头。消除了“排挤老弱，不要幼小”的现象。
    解决饲草问题的办法是：把社内公养、私养牲口的需草量和草源加以排队，挖掘潜力，广泛收集饲草；组织以柴换草，把能用的饲草充分运用起来。如滨县二区彭李乡十一个农业生产合作社，共有耕畜一百八十头，全年要用草九十七万多斤。这些社现有的牛草只够用五个半月。还要再增养耕畜，饲草就更不够了。他们进一步排了草源的队，把能作饲草的玉米秸三十四万多斤用作饲草，又到垦利割草二十四万多斤，这样完全克服了饲草不足的困难。
    目前惠民地区的牲畜价格虽然在大部分地区初步稳定下来，但是地区之间还有严重的不平衡状态。一方面，有些以养畜为副业的地区（如无棣县）牲畜繁殖较多，找不到出路。部分重灾区和若干集中产棉区，仍过分强调养畜困难，不去积极做好保护牲畜的工作。这些地区牲畜问题仍然十分紧张。另一方面，在一般地区虽然已经取得了保护牲畜的初步经验，但是还未能认真总结和普遍推广，特别是当前冬耕生产、保护牲畜和粮食“三定”到户工作都在紧张进行，有些地方已经呈现顾此失彼的现象。对耕畜如不妥善加以安排，在冬耕大体结束后，还可能出现出卖一批耕畜的危险。因此，地委最近又要求各县对牲畜市场、价格情况，再作进一步的深入检查；对牲畜问题紧张的乡村和农业生产合作社的情况再作一次研究，找出问题的症结所在，迅速加以解决。同时要认真总结已有的经验，普遍推广。在高青、齐东、广饶、利津、桓台等耕畜较少的县，要组织供销合作社和农业生产合作社签订合同，去无棣县采购一部分耕畜，有计划有步骤地调剂余缺，消除牲畜问题的紧张状态。
