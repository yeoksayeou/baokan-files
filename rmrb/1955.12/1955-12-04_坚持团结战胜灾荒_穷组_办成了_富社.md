    Persist in Unity to Overcome Disasters
    “Poor Team” Becomes a “Rich Cooperative”

    Comrade Editor:
    In April 1951, twenty-six poor and middle peasant households in Sunjiafeng Natural Village, Changlinhe Town, Changlinhe District, Feidong County, Anhui, organized a mutual aid team and increased production that year. However, by the summer planting season in May 1952, eight middle peasant households with complete plowing cattle and farm tools felt that they were being taken advantage of by the poor peasants and were unwilling to stay in the team. After unsuccessful persuasion and education, these eight middle peasant households took three poor peasant households and withdrew to form another team; fifteen households were left, all of whom were poor households lacking both plowing cattle and farm tools. Therefore, this team was called the "poor team."

    Although the difficulties facing this "poor team" were great, team leader Sun Hongqing (a Communist Party member) used the benefits of organization over the past year to educate the team members, strengthening their determination to follow the path of collectivization. Under the leadership of the Party branch, Sun Hongqing raised money by borrowing from the government and temporarily selling his own belongings to buy a black Sha cattle; he also repaired two broken waterwheels, a broken plow, a broken harrow, and other small farm tools such as iron shovels and hoes. By the spring of 1953, four households, including Niu Ancai's, had saved some money through frugality and jointly bought a yellow steer. In this way, the team had plowing cattle and farm tools, and gradually grew and consolidated.

    Unexpectedly, in 1954, the local area experienced a major flood, the likes of which had not been seen in a century. More than forty mu of embankment fields in the team were completely flooded, and the remaining six mu of fields were mostly drought-prone and reclaimed land, so many team members became pessimistic and disappointed. The Party branch supported these fifteen poor peasants, educating team members to unite and overcome the disaster. The team developed various agricultural and sideline productions based on the labor force situation of the entire team. They planted vegetables on un-flooded land and in the open spaces in front of and behind their houses; they organized team members to go out to transport materials and process cotton; Sun Hongqing and Communist Youth League member Niu Anyuan led everyone to dig sand in very cold water, and Communist Party member Niu Ancai took the lead in organizing a fishing team of more than ten people to break the ice and fish in the cold weather... In this way, the whole team earned more than three thousand yuan, which not only maintained the lives of the team members, but also had a surplus of more than three hundred and forty yuan, built five houses, bought a large bull, and repaired and added some other farm tools. This fact strengthened the confidence of all team members in overcoming the disaster and their determination to follow the path of collectivization.

    On the victorious road of overcoming serious disasters, in December 1954, the Sunjiafeng Mutual Aid Team was honorably transformed into an agricultural production cooperative. At that time, it was the winter sowing season, and the agricultural cooperative, under the Party's call to "replant one mu for every mu drained, plant one mu for every mu returned," launched a rush-plowing and rush-planting campaign, rushing to plant more than twenty mu of various crops, and also dredged more than 10,000 dan of lake sediment (a layer of dirt floating on the lake) to use as base fertilizer for wheat fields. As a result, this year's wheat yield averaged more than 260 jin per mu, with the highest reaching more than 370 jin. After the wheat harvest, the whole cooperative planted more than forty mu of rice, and due to the processing of fertilizer and rational close planting, another bumper harvest was obtained. The average rice yield was more than 700 jin per mu, with the highest reaching more than 840 jin. Members generally increased their income and improved their lives. The whole cooperative also sold more than 4,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

    In this way, the Sunjiafeng Agricultural Cooperative established extremely high prestige among the masses. Before the autumn planting, the cooperative had expanded to 423 households, and the original eleven households that had withdrawn from the team also joined. At present, the cooperative is carrying out a massive drought resistance and rush planting campaign, striving for a greater bumper harvest in the next wheat season.

    坚持团结战胜灾荒
    “穷组”办成了“富社”编辑同志：
    安徽肥东县长临河区长临河镇孙家凤自然村的二十六户贫农和中农，在一九五一年四月间组织了一个互助组，当年增加了生产。但是到一九五二年五月间夏种的时候，八户耕牛、农具齐全的中农认为他们吃贫农的亏，不愿意再留在这个组里。经过说服教育无效，这八户中农带了三户贫农退出去另外组织了一个组；留下十五户都是既无耕牛、又缺农具的困难户。因此，这个组就被人称为“穷组”。
    摆在这个“穷组”面前的困难虽然大，但是组长孙宏庆（共产党员）用一年来组织起来的好处教育组员，使大家坚定了走合作化道路的决心。孙宏庆在党支部领导下，用向政府贷款和自己暂时变卖东西等办法，凑钱买了一条黑沙牛；又修理了两盘破水车、一张破犁、一张破耙和其他铁锹、锄头等小农具。到一九五三年春，牛安才等四户又省吃俭用积蓄了一些钱，合伙买了一条黄犍牛。这样，这个组有了耕牛和农具，就逐渐成长和巩固起来。
    没有想到，一九五四年当地出现了百年没有过的特大洪水。组里四十多亩圩田全被淹光了，剩下来的六亩多田都是一些久旱地和开荒地，因此很多组员就悲观失望起来。党支部支持了这十五户贫苦农民，教育组员团结起来，战胜灾荒。组里根据全组劳动力情况，展开了各种农副业生产。他们在没有遭淹的土地和家前屋后的空地上种上了菜；他们组织组员出去搞搬运物资和加工棉花的工作；孙宏庆和青年团员牛安元带动大家在很凉的水里扒沙，共产党员牛安才带头组织了一个十多人的捕鱼队在严寒的天气下破冰打鱼……。这样，全组共收入了三千多元，不仅维持了组员们的生活，而且剩余了三百四十多元，修盖了五间房子，买了一条大牯牛，还修添了一些其他农具。这一事实，使全体组员增强了战胜灾荒的信心和走合作化道路的决心。
    在战胜严重灾荒的胜利道路上，一九五四年十二月，孙家凤互助组光荣地转为农业生产合作社。当时正是冬播时节，农业社在党的“排一亩、补一亩，退一亩、种一亩”的号召下，展开了抢耕抢种运动，共抢种了各种作物二十多亩，还捞了一万多担湖淀（湖上面飘的一层脏物）做麦田基肥。这样，今年小麦每亩产量平均二百六十多斤，最高达三百七十多斤。麦收以后，全社栽了四十多亩水稻，由于加工施肥，合理密植，又获得了丰收。水稻每亩产量平均七百多斤，最高的达到八百四十多斤。社员们普遍增加了收入，改善了生活。全社还卖给国家余粮四千多斤。
    这样，孙家凤农业社在群众中树立了极高的威望。秋种前，这个社已扩大为四百二十三户，原来从组里退出去的十一户也参加了。目前，社里正进行着声势浩大的抗旱抢种工作，争取来年麦季更大的丰收。  毕治平
