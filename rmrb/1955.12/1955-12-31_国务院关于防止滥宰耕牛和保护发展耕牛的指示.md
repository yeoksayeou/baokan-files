Since the autumn harvest this year, the prices of strong cattle, large cattle, mules, and horses have been stable and even higher than the same period last year, reflecting the farmers' enthusiasm for expanding reproduction following the high tide of agricultural cooperation, which is a good phenomenon. However, in some places, the prices of weak cattle, small-sized cattle, and calves have plummeted, the market supply is large, the transaction volume is small, and the prices are lower than those of beef cattle, resulting in the indiscriminate slaughter of cattle. This situation is very abnormal, and it is particularly prominent in several provinces with a large number of cattle, such as Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Anhui.

The reasons for the above situation are: Firstly, due to the rapid development of agricultural cooperation, agricultural production cooperatives and farmers have a certain degree of blindness in dealing with the issue of draught animals. Many agricultural production cooperatives believe that old, weak, and small-sized cattle are weak and cannot pull new farm implements. They believe that calves cannot work for two or three years, so raising them is not cost-effective. Therefore, they are eager to sell them and exchange them for large cattle, strong cattle, or other large livestock. Many newly established cooperatives also have shortcomings in handling cattle, or have not had time to make proper arrangements. Therefore, the cattle owners are not sure whether their cattle will be used, how much they will be paid, and whether there will be forage. They are also eager to sell them. Some farmers who are preparing to join the cooperatives also think that since the land will be managed by the cooperative after joining, they want to sell their cattle before joining.

Secondly, the inter-regional and seasonal adjustment of draught animals used to be carried out by livestock merchants, but in the past two years, there are very few private merchants transporting livestock, and our work has not kept up. Therefore, a temporary and local phenomenon of excessive cattle has appeared in some areas.

Thirdly, we also have shortcomings in price control and market management, so there is a lack of effective control over the slaughter of cattle. Although the prices of beef and cowhide have fallen, selling cattle for slaughter is still more profitable than selling live cattle, which stimulates butchers and a small number of farmers to indiscriminately slaughter cattle. In addition, some local tax cadres are willing to collect more taxes, purchasing agencies are willing to collect more hides, and commercial agencies are willing to ensure the supply of meat, so in practice, they have relaxed the control over the slaughter of cattle, allowing the indiscriminate slaughter to develop. This is very dangerous.

It must be seen that in China, after agricultural cooperation, it will not be possible to replace draught animals with a large number of tractors in a short period of time. Cattle and other draught animals are still the main power for agricultural production. It must also be seen that, nationwide, there are not too many draught animals, but too few. The apparent surplus of cattle in some places is only a temporary and local phenomenon. If, in the rapid development of agricultural cooperation, we do not promptly lead farmers to overcome the blindness of squeezing out weak cattle, small cattle, and calves, and do not resolutely take measures to protect all existing cattle, it will bring extremely unfavorable consequences to future agricultural production and the socialist transformation of agriculture. To this end, the following instructions are now given:

I. Local leading organs must vigorously persuade agricultural production cooperatives to immediately combine production planning and take over all the cattle owned by the members for unified arrangement. What kind of work each cow does, how much work it does, how many work points are assigned, and the source of feed, etc., must be arranged as soon as possible so that everything is settled. In order to facilitate unified arrangement, agricultural production cooperatives can, with the voluntary consent of the members, price the cattle owned by the members and include them in the cooperative. The pricing should be calculated according to the average price of the year, slightly higher than the market price after autumn; the repayment period should not be too long. It is necessary to persuade the cadres and members of agricultural production cooperatives that large cattle and mules are of course good, but everywhere is undergoing cooperation, and everywhere hopes for large livestock, but there are only so many large livestock in the country, and the supply cannot meet the demand. The hope of exchanging for large livestock will definitely fail. Therefore, it is necessary to make good use of the existing cattle power within the cooperative. It is also necessary to persuade them to plan for the long term and take over all the existing calves so that they can develop and grow, in order to replace and supplement the shortage of cattle in two or three years. If some agricultural production cooperatives do have a surplus of cattle after unified use, they can conduct a guided adjustment of surplus and shortage between cooperatives; if they must be sold, it should be approved by the district office. Members selling privately owned public-use cattle must be approved by the management committee of the cooperative. For farmers who sell cattle and then join the cooperative, the agricultural production cooperative may stipulate that they must invest the proceeds from the sale of cattle into the cooperative as a share fund or investment, in order to restrict them from selling cattle for their own benefit before joining the cooperative.

II. Some places have always been concentrated production areas and export areas for cattle. The local supply and marketing cooperatives should take livestock management as an important business and do a good job in purchasing and transporting them for sale to other places. Some places are cattle-deficient areas, and the local supply and marketing cooperatives should actively contact the cattle-producing areas to do a good job in purchasing and supplying cattle. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should also pay attention to improving cattle breeds and breeding large cattle.

The supply and marketing cooperatives should first adjust the cattle they buy nearby. Weak cattle, small cattle, and calves that cannot be sold for a while can be transported to mountainous areas or areas with grass for temporary grazing. Only old and disabled cattle that are truly unable to cultivate can be sold to food companies or butchers for slaughter. It is estimated that large-scale livestock management may have some losses, but in order to preserve and maintain the existing cattle, a certain degree of loss is worthwhile. If the losses are too large, they can be reported to the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives for resolution. It is necessary to educate all staff members of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels so that they recognize the importance of this work and do it conscientiously.

III. The state entrusts the supply and marketing cooperatives to establish cattle trading service stations at the distribution centers of cattle to strengthen market management. Except for the direct purchase by food companies' purchasing stations, all public and private livestock transactions must be carried out at the service stations. The supply and marketing cooperatives should organize and transform livestock brokers, and ban their speculative manipulation and price manipulation, so that they can continue to engage in the proper business of transporting and adjusting cattle under strict market management.

IV. In order to effectively prohibit the indiscriminate slaughter of cattle, all localities should, based on specific circumstances, stipulate a normal slaughter ratio and reasonable slaughter standards, and designate special personnel to approve them. For butchers, they should be further organized and transformed, stipulating that the beef cattle required by the butchers should be supplied or designated for purchase by the supply and marketing cooperatives, and they must not directly and indiscriminately purchase them. It is forbidden for any organs and farmers to slaughter cattle privately. Farmers who intentionally kill or injure cattle should be given serious criticism and education; those with serious circumstances should also be given necessary punishment.

V. Corresponding economic measures should be taken to reasonably adjust the prices of cattle, beef cattle, beef, and the purchase prices of cowhide. The range of downward and upward adjustments in each region will be issued separately by the

    国务院关于防止滥宰耕牛和保护发展耕牛的指示
    今年秋收以来，壮牛、大牛和骡、马的价格平稳，并且较去年同期有所上涨，表现了随着农业合作化高潮而来的农民扩大再生产的积极性，这是好现象。但是，在有些地方，弱牛、体格小的牛和牛犊的价格大跌，上市量大，成交量小，价格低于菜牛，因而发生了滥宰耕牛的现象，这种情况很不正常。这在几个耕牛较多的省份，如河南、河北、山东、安徽等省，更为突出。
    造成上述情况的原因，首先，由于在农业合作化大发展当中，农业生产合作社和农民在对待耕畜问题上存在着一定的盲目性。许多农业生产合作社认为老牛、弱牛和体格小的牛，力量小，拉不动新式农具，认为牛犊在两三年内不能干活，饲养不合算，因而急于把它们卖出去，换回大牛、壮牛或其他大牲畜。许多新成立的社，对于耕牛的处理还有缺点，或者还没有来得及妥善安排，因此牛主对于自己所有的耕牛是否被使用，报酬多少，有无草料，都心中无数，也急于出卖。还有一些准备入社的农民，认为入社后土地反正归社负责经营，也想在入社以前卖掉耕牛。
    其次，地区间和季节间的耕畜调剂，过去是通过牲畜商贩进行的，近两年来私商贩运牲畜的很少了，我们的工作又没有跟上去，因而就在某些地区出现了耕牛过多的暂时性的局部性的现象。
    再次，我们在价格掌握和市场管理上也有缺点，因而对屠宰耕牛缺乏有效的控制。牛肉牛皮的价格虽有下降，但是把耕牛宰杀后出卖仍然比出卖活牛获利较多，这就刺激了屠商和少数农民滥宰耕畜。加之某些地方的税务干部愿意多收税，收购机构愿意多收皮，商业机构愿意保证肉食供应，因而在实际上放松了对屠宰耕牛的控制，使滥宰现象得以发展。这是很危险的。
    必须看到，在我国农业合作化以后，在一个相当长的时期内，还不可能一下子用大量的拖拉机来代替耕畜，耕牛和其他耕畜仍然是农业生产上的主要动力。还必须看到，就全国来说，耕畜不是多了，而是少了，现在有些地方显得牛有多余，只是一时一地的现象。如果我们在农业合作化的大发展中，不及时领导农民克服排挤弱牛、小牛和牛犊的盲目性，不坚决采取保护现有全部耕牛的措施，就会给今后的农业生产和农业的社会主义改造带来极为不利的后果。为此，现在作如下的指示：
    一、各地领导机关必须要大力说服农业生产合作社，立即结合生产的规划，把社员所有的耕牛全部包下来，统筹安排。每一头牛做什么活，做多少活，评给多少工分以及饲料来源等等，都要及早安排好，使之各有着落。为了便于统筹安排，农业生产合作社可以经过社员自愿，将社员的耕牛作价入社。作价应当按照常年的平均价格计算，而略高于秋后的市价；偿还期限不要过长。必须说服农业生产合作社的干部和社员，大牛和骡马固然好，但是到处都在合作化，到处都希望大牲口，而全国的大牲口只有那么多，供不应求，调换大牲口的希望一定落空，因此只有很好地运用社内现有耕畜的力量。还必须说服他们从长远打算，把现有的牛犊也全部包下来，使之发育成长，以便两三年后接替和补充耕牛的不足。如果某些农业生产合作社的耕畜在统一使用以后确有多余，可以有领导地进行社与社之间的余缺调剂；必须出卖的，应当经过区公所批准。社员出卖私有公用的耕畜，必须经过合作社管理委员会的同意。对于卖了耕畜而后入社的农民，可以由农业生产合作社规定，要他把出卖耕畜所得的价款投入社内，作为股份基金或者投资，以便限制他们在入社以前为着自利的目的而出卖耕畜。
    二、有些地方历来是耕牛的集中产地和输出区，当地的供销合作社应当将经营牲畜作为重要的业务，做好收购和调运工作，向外推销。有些地方是缺牛地区，当地的供销合作社应当主动地同产牛区联系，做好采购和供应工作。各级供销合作社并且应当注意改良耕畜品种和繁殖大耕畜的工作。
    供销合作社对买到的耕牛，首先应当就近调剂。一时卖不了的弱牛、小牛和牛犊，可以赶运到山地或者有草的地区暂时牧养。只有确实已经不能耕作的老牛和残牛，才可以卖给食品公司或者屠商宰杀。估计大规模的经营牲畜，可能会有若干赔累，但为了保存和维持现有的耕畜，一定程度的赔累是值得的，赔累过大的可以报请全国供销合作总社解决。必须教育各级供销合作社的全体工作人员，使他们认识这一工作的重要意义，认真做好这一工作。
    三、国家委托供销合作社在耕牛集散地点，建立耕畜交易服务所，加强市场管理。除食品公司收购站直接收购的以外，所有公私牲畜买卖，必须一律进所交易。供销合作社对牲畜牙纪应当加以组织和改造，取缔他们投机操纵、播弄价格的行为，使他们在严格的市场管理下，继续经营贩运和调剂耕畜的正当业务。
    四、为了有效地禁止滥宰耕牛，各地应当根据具体情况，规定出一个正常的宰杀比例和合理的宰杀标准，并且指定专人掌握批准。对于屠商，应当进一步地加以组织和改造，规定屠商所需要的菜牛一律由供销合作社供给或指定收购，不得直接滥行购买。禁止任何机关和农民私自宰杀耕牛。对于有意把耕畜跌死或者弄伤的农民，应当给以严肃的批评和教育；其中情节严重的，还应当给予必要的惩罚。
    五、对于耕牛、菜牛、牛肉等价格和牛皮的收购牌价要采取相应的经济措施，加以合理调整。各地区调低和提高的幅度，另由商业部、对外贸易部和供销合作总社分别下达。
    以上指示，必须立即布置执行。耕牛较多、问题比较严重的省分，必须使用更多的力量，迅速制止滥宰耕牛的现象。有些地方，对于毛驴也有类似的情况，可以参照本指示办理。
