    Earnestly Help Backward Units
    Kong Sang
    In our various departments and enterprises, there are always some backward elements. They often drag down the entire department or enterprise, preventing them from completing the state plan, or offsetting the achievements of advanced units in overfulfilling the plan.

    In order to strive for the early completion of the First Five-Year Plan and accelerate the pace of China's industrialization, one of the most important tasks is to reduce or even eliminate these backward links.

    The Shenyang Bicycle Factory was once a backward factory that failed to complete its plans for a long time. The key to the factory's failure to complete its plans was the particularly high repair rate of the frame baking, wheel rim plating, and tube drawing groups. In the third quarter of this year, the Party, administrative, trade union, and Youth League organizations of the Shenyang Bicycle Factory provided specific assistance to these three groups, resolved ideological problems such as widespread neglect of quality and disunity within the groups, and helped them learn nine advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and China. As a result, from August onwards, these three groups completed their production tasks every month, enabling the entire factory to comprehensively fulfill the state plan in October.

    This example illustrates the importance of helping backward elements in completing the state plan, and also shows that helping backward elements is entirely possible. In our enterprises, the vast majority of workers are unwilling to see their units remain backward for a long time. If the plan cannot be completed for a long time, it indicates their own shortcomings and also that they have some difficulties that they cannot overcome themselves. For these units, what is most needed is for the leading organs to provide in-depth and practical assistance, point out the direction of their efforts, teach them specific methods, and enable them to build confidence from the gradual progress they achieve.

    However, some departments and administrative bureaus are not doing this. They simply criticize and urge backward units without teaching any specific methods. They only issue lengthy "principled" and "comprehensive" instructions, regardless of whether the units below can specifically apply them according to their own characteristics. They also frequently send working groups down, but do not equip the working groups with highly skilled personnel. As a result, although the comrades in the working groups conduct painstaking investigations and research, they can often only bring back "situation reports" to the higher authorities, and cannot solve practical problems for the lower levels. At the same time, the tasks of the working groups are different. One comes to study wage issues, another to study equipment maintenance issues. Each working group only focuses on the local situation and cannot help the grassroots units to consider comprehensively, make comprehensive plans, and make comprehensive arrangements. As a result, when the working group is present, the systems, methods, and advanced experiences are implemented very well; as soon as the working group leaves, all the systems and methods that "have achieved significant results" disappear. There are also some problems that have long been resolved in some units. However, the leading organs do not pay attention to exchanging and promoting advanced experiences, so that some so-called backward units are dragged down by these "key" problems for a long time and always fail to complete the state plan.

    Striving for the early completion of the First Five-Year Plan requires the intensive efforts of the vast number of workers; however, it also requires the leading organs to overcome bureaucratic work styles, go deep into the grassroots, and especially provide practical assistance to backward units.

### 切实帮助落后的单位

    切实帮助落后的单位
    孔桑
    在我们的各个部门和企业中，都有一些落后的部分。它们常常拖累着整个部门、整个企业不能完成国家计划，或者把先进单位超额完成计划的成就抵消了。
    为了争取提前完成第一个五年计划，加快我国工业化的速度，最重要的任务之一，就是要减少以至消灭这些落后环节。
    沈阳自行车厂也曾经是一个长期完不成计划的落后厂。而这个厂所以完不成计划，关键又在于烤车架子、镀车圈和拔管三个小组的返修率特别高。今年第三季度，沈阳自行车厂的党、行政、工会、青年团组织，对这三个小组进行了具体的帮助，解决了小组里普遍的忽视质量和不团结等思想问题；帮助他们学习了九种苏联的和国内的先进经验。结果，从八月份起，这三个小组月月完成生产任务，从而使得全厂在十月份也全面完成了国家计划。
    这个例子说明了帮助落后部分对完成国家计划的重要意义，也说明了帮助落后部分是完全可能的。在我们的企业当中，绝大多数的职工们是不甘心自己的单位长期落后的。计划长期完不成，一方面固然说明他们本身有缺点，另一方面也说明了他们的确有些困难自己不能克服。对于这些单位，最需要的是领导机关对他们进行深入的切实的帮助，给他们指出努力方向，教给他们具体办法，使他们从逐步获得的进步当中树立起信心来。
    但是，现在有一些部门和管理局没有这样做。他们对于落后的单位，总是单纯地批评、督促，而不教给任何具体办法。他们只发布长篇大论的“原则性”、“全面性”的指示，不管下面会不会根据本单位的特点具体运用。他们也经常派遣工作组下去，却不给工作组配备水平较高的工作人员。结果，工作组的同志虽然辛辛苦苦地调查研究，但是常常只能给上级带回一些“情况汇报”，而不能给下面解决实际问题。同时，工作组的任务各不相同，这个来研究工资问题，那个来研究设备维护问题，每个工作组都只从局部着眼，而不能帮助基层单位全面考虑，进行全面的规划，做全面的安排。结果，工作组在的时候，制度、办法、先进经验，都推行得很好；工作组一走，一切“已经取得了显著效果”的制度、办法，也就随之而去了。还有一些问题，在某些单位本来是早已解决了的，但是，领导机关不注意交流、推广先进的经验，以致一些所谓落后的单位，长期被这些“关键”问题拖累着，总是完不成国家计划。
    争取提前完成第一个五年计划，需要广大职工的紧张努力；但是，也同样需要领导机关克服官僚主义作风，深入到基层去，特别要切实地帮助落后的单位。
