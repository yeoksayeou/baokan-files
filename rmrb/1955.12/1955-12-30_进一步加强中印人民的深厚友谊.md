Further Strengthen the Profound Friendship Between the Chinese and Indian People
Jin Zhonghua

Song Qingling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country, was invited to visit India and received a warm welcome from the Indian government and people. In New Delhi, following the recent visit of Soviet leaders, the enthusiastic and harmonious sentiments of people working for peace once again prevailed. People recalled the feelings of mutual care and support generated by the two peoples in their long struggles for independence and freedom in the past, and talked about the common aspirations they currently hold in the cause of building new countries and maintaining peace. International public opinion regards this visit as a major event in international life.

This is not accidental. It reflects the new situation in Asian history and illustrates the profound changes in the world situation.

As Vice-Chairman Song Qingling said, she had wanted to visit this great neighbor for many years, but in the past, due to obstruction, her wish was never realized. As Prime Minister Nehru said, ten and a half years ago, he was still imprisoned in Ahmednagar Fort, and at that time China was also experiencing the suffering of war and foreign aggression, but ten years have passed, and during this period "how much rise and fall have we seen in China and India!"

Yes, imperialism has declined, and China and India have become two new great powers standing tall in Asia and the world. Beijing, New Delhi, and places like Yangon and Jakarta are no longer places isolated from the outside world, but centers for frequent international friendly contacts.

Looking back at the past thirty years, Asia was in the midst of a storm of national struggle and social revolution. At that time, the Chinese and Indian people were rudely separated by imperialists. The situations we experienced were not entirely the same, but they also had basic commonalities. These two giants, together accounting for more than one-third of mankind, were awakening. The people fought one after another, and prisons, batons, and guns could not scare them. We also heard the sound of the October Revolution. We all felt each other's earth-shaking pulsations in the struggle. We could hear each other's voices in the struggle for national independence and freedom.

We once expressed our mutual concern and support in the struggle through some advanced figures. When the Kuomintang reactionaries colluded with imperialism in 1932 and frantically undermined the basic rights of the Chinese working people, Ms. Song Qingling and Mr. Lu Xun and others initiated the establishment of the China League for Civil Rights in Shanghai. In her declaration, she exposed the imperialists for putting up the false banner of "democracy" on the one hand and using armed forces to carry out aggression, oppress the people of the colonies, and protect their own "rights" to plunder the people of the colonies and semi-colonies. She called on "the people of the colonies to concentrate their strength and smash the shackles of imperialist rule." In September 1933, the World Anti-Imperialist War Conference secretly convened in Shanghai. In her speech, she condemned British imperialism for fearing the Indian revolution and oppressing the Indian people. In 1944, when the international anti-fascist war had reached its climax, and the American and British imperialists turned to suppress the national movements in the colonies, in her radio speech on Sun Yat-sen Memorial Day in the United States, she pointed out that Sun Yat-sen's lifelong goal was to strive for full national equality. She believed that all national revolutions would receive the support of progressive thoughts and actions around the world, and that there would be lasting peace in the world only when international democracy was realized. Therefore, she criticized Britain for continuing to suppress Indian independence.

After a long and arduous struggle, the people of China and India finally realized the independence and freedom we had been pursuing. We are each building new countries. Of course, we each follow our own path and have our own opinions. However, when the people of the two countries resumed free exchanges after such a long period of separation, we found that there was no estrangement in our feelings, and we were in complete harmony. We all love peace and never want to interfere in other people's affairs. From thousands of years of historical relations and thousands of miles of geographical contact, there are no traces of wounds between the people of the two countries. This is a very precious record of peaceful coexistence.

In recent years, people from the cultural, artistic, and scientific fields of China and India have visited each other and established friendly relations, which has further enriched our feelings and understanding. The Chinese people admired the Red Fort in Delhi and the Taj Mahal in Agra, just as Indian friends looked at our Great Wall and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, and deeply realized that the long history, culture, and the wisdom and creativity of the working people of our two countries are worth being proud of.

The friendship between the Chinese and Indian people at first sight has a more realistic foundation in today's international situation. When we are each restoring and developing our national economies and building independent and free new lives, we all need a long-term peaceful international environment. However, there are still some imperialists who are unwilling to give up after losing two huge objects of plunder like China and India, and attempt to drag us back to the old road of semi-colonies and colonies. Therefore, the people of China and India will naturally stand together more closely in the cause of safeguarding our hard-won national independence and defending peace in Asia and the world.

It is precisely because of this that in her opening speech at the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference in October 1952, Chairman Song Qingling pointed out that "national independence and peace come from the same struggle," which expressed the common understanding of the people of China and India and the people of other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

It is also for this reason that in June 1954, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country visited India at the invitation of Prime Minister Nehru and jointly issued the historic joint statement on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which was warmly welcomed by the vast number of people in Asian countries and other parts of the world. Immediately following the Sino-Indian joint statement, the prime ministers of China and Myanmar also issued a statement with the same meaning. Nearly one billion people in the Asian region have formed a huge force for maintaining peace. Now, the great Soviet Union, standing at the forefront of the world's struggle for peace and democracy, important Asian-African countries such as Myanmar, Indonesia, and Egypt, Yugoslavia, which is building a new country far away in Europe, and some other countries, have all expressed their agreement and support for these five principles. The idea of peaceful coexistence is expanding its influence in all aspects of the world.

China and India have made unremitting efforts to resolve international disputes through peaceful consultations and strive to ease international tensions, and have achieved many successes. The Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina were achieved through the efforts of China and India and with the strong cooperation of the Soviet Union and other countries. India has shouldered a major responsibility in supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and it has repeatedly condemned the behavior of certain countries attempting to undermine the Geneva Accords. At the Bandung Conference in April this year, the joint efforts of politicians from China and India, as well as Myanmar, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries, made important contributions to the success of the conference.

We firmly believe that people of all countries with different systems and beliefs can coexist peacefully. The people of China and India have provided the world with a good example. The imperialists have attempted to sow discord among us, they have shamefully failed, and they will always be defeated. As long as imperialism does not interfere, there will be peaceful life in the Asian region. Therefore, the people of China, India, and other Asian countries are united in resolutely opposing military blocs such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, and are also determined to oppose the imperialists' forcible occupation of Taiwan, Goa, West Irian, and the establishment of military bases and planning new wars in many Asian countries.

Vice-Chairman Song Qingling said at the welcoming rally in Delhi that "the Indian people support the Chinese people on the Taiwan issue, just as we fully support the Indian people on the Goa issue." This fully expresses the feelings and position of the Chinese people.

Prime Minister Nehru has repeatedly condemned some people in certain countries for stubbornly closing their eyes and refusing to recognize the existence of China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the world's population, and believes that if the United Nations wants to reorganize its prestige and solve many difficult international problems, it must restore China's legitimate status in the United Nations. The Chinese people are grateful for this just support, and we believe that this fully expresses the feelings and position of the Indian people.

The profound friendship between the people of China and India is a huge force for defending peace. In recent years, thanks to the joint efforts of our two countries, the Soviet Union, and many other countries, the tense international situation has been eased to some extent. However, the pursuers of the "Cold War" policy are obviously unwilling to give up, and they continue to create tension in various aspects of Europe and Asia. Therefore, we still need to make greater and unremitting efforts.

The Chinese people support the proposal of collective peace put forward by the Indian government. We hope that all countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including the United States, will sign a collective peace treaty to replace the existing antagonistic military blocs. The people of China and India and the people of other Asian countries must actively strive for this ideal.

After visiting India, Vice-Chairman Song Qingling will also visit Myanmar. This will further develop the existing profound friendship between the people of China, India, and Myanmar, and it will give strong encouragement to the struggle of the people of Asian countries to maintain peace.

    进一步加强中印人民的深厚友谊
    金仲华
    我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄应邀访问印度，受到了印度政府和人民的热烈欢迎。在新德里，继最近苏联领导人访问之后，再一次洋溢着为和平而努力的人民之间的友好融洽的热情。人们回顾着两国人民在过去长期间争取独立自由的斗争中所产生的相互关怀和支持的情感，谈论着目前在从事新国家的建设和维护和平的事业中共同怀抱的愿望。各国舆论把这种访问认为是国际生活中的重大事件。
    这不是偶然的。它反映着亚洲历史的新情况，也说明了世界局势的深刻变化。
    正如宋庆龄副委员长所说的，多年来她一直想访问这个伟大的邻邦，但是在过去的年代里，由于受到阻挠，她的愿望始终未能实现。也正如尼赫鲁总理所说的，十年半以前，他还被囚在阿迈德纳加堡监狱中，那时候中国也正经历着战争的苦难，遭受外国的侵略，可是十年过去了，这一期间“我们在中国和印度这两个地方看到多少盛衰兴亡的事啊！”
    是的，帝国主义衰落下去了，中国和印度已经成为两个新的大国屹立在亚洲和世界上。北京、新德里，还有仰光、雅加达等等地方，不再是和外面世界隔断着的地方，而是频繁地进行着国际友好接触的中心了。
    回想过去的三十年间，亚洲正处在民族斗争和社会革命的暴风雨中。那时候，中国人民和印度人民被帝国主义者蛮横地隔断着。我们所经历的情况不尽相同，但是也有着基本上的共同点。这两个合起来超过全人类三分之一的巨人在觉醒起来。人民前仆后继地斗争着，监狱、警棍、枪炮都吓不倒他们。我们同样听到了十月革命的炮声。我们都感觉到彼此在斗争中震撼着大地的搏动。我们在争取民族独立自由中的呼声，彼此都可以听到的。
    我们曾经通过了一些先进人物表达了彼此在斗争中的相互关切和支持的情感。当一九三二年国民党反动派勾结帝国主义、疯狂地摧残着中国劳苦大众的基本权利的时候，宋庆龄女士和鲁迅先生等在上海发起组织中国民权保障同盟，她在发表的宣言中揭露了帝国主义者一面挂着假“民主”的招牌，一面用武装部队进行侵略，压迫殖民地人民，保护他们自己掠夺殖民地与半殖民地人民的“权利”。她号召“殖民地的人民必须集中力量，粉碎帝国主义统治的枷锁”。一九三三年九月，世界反对帝国主义战争会议在上海秘密开会，她在发表的演说中谴责英帝国主义害怕印度革命，压迫印度人民。一九四四年，当国际反法西斯战争已进行到高潮，而美英帝国主义却转而对殖民地的民族运动进行压制的时候，她在对美国举行孙中山纪念日所作的广播演说中，指出孙中山一生的奋斗目标，就是争取充分的民族平等，她认为所有的民族革命都会得到世界各地进步思想和行动的支持，而且只有当国际民主实现之后，世界上才会有巩固的和平，因此她对于英国继续压制印度独立的现象，加以指责。
    经过了漫长的艰苦斗争，中国和印度两大国家的人民终于实现了我们所追求的独立与自由了。我们各自在建设着新的国家。固然，我们各自遵循着自己的道路，有着自己的见解。但是，当两国人民经过了那么长久的阻隔而恢复自由往来的时候，我们发现彼此在感情上是毫无隔膜，完全协调的。我们都热爱和平，从来不想干涉别人。从几千年的历史关系和几千哩的地理接触中，找不到两国人民之间的创痕。这是和平共处的非常珍贵的纪录。
    最近几年来，中印两国文化艺术、科学等方面人士相互进行访问，建立了友好联系，更加丰富了我们之间的情感和了解。中国人民瞻仰了德里的红堡和亚格拉的泰吉·玛哈尔陵，正像印度朋友看了我们的长城和北京天坛一样，深深地体会到我们两国这样悠久的历史文化和劳动人民的智慧创造是值得骄傲的。
    中印人民一见如故的友谊，在今天的国际形势下，更有了现实的基础。当我们各自在恢复和发展自己的国民经济，建设独立自由的新生活的时候，我们都需要长期的和平国际环境。但是目前仍然有一些帝国主义者为了失去像中国和印度这样两个巨大的掠夺对象而死不甘心，企图把我们拖回半殖民地和殖民地的老路。因此，中印两国人民在维护我们得来不易的民族独立和保卫亚洲与世界和平的事业中，更自然地会紧紧站在一起。
    正因为如此，在一九五二年十月亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上宋庆龄主席发表的开幕词中，她指出“民族独立与和平是从同一个斗争中产生出来的”，这是表达了中国和印度人民以及亚洲太平洋区域其他各国人民的共同认识的。
    也正因为如此，一九五四年六月我国周恩来总理应尼赫鲁总理的邀请访问印度，共同发表了和平共处五项原则的历史性的联合声明，获得了亚洲各国和世界各地区广大人民的热烈欢迎。紧接着中印联合声明之后，中缅两国总理也发表了同样意义的声明。将近十亿人民在亚洲地区形成了一个维护和平的巨大力量。现在，站在世界和平民主斗争最前列的伟大的苏联，亚非重要国家像缅甸、印度尼西亚和埃及，远在欧洲建设着新国家的南斯拉夫，以及其他一些国家，都已表示同意和支持这五项原则。和平共处的思想正在世界各方面扩大它的影响。
    中国和印度对于用和平协商方式解决国际争端，争取缓和国际紧张局势，作了不懈的努力，并且取得了不少成就。朝鲜停战和印度支那恢复和平，就是通过中国和印度的努力以及在苏联和其他国家的有力合作下实现的。印度对监督日内瓦协议的实施方面，担负着重大的责任，它一再指责了某些国家企图破坏日内瓦协议的行为。在今年四月的万隆会议中，中国和印度以及缅甸、印度尼西亚、埃及等国政治家们的共同努力，对于这个会议的成就作了重要的贡献。
    我们坚信一切不同制度和信仰的各国人民可以和平共处。中印两国人民已经给世界提供了良好的榜样。帝国主义者企图在我们中间进行挑拨，它们已经可耻地失败了，而且要永远遭到失败。只要帝国主义不来进行干涉，亚洲地区就会有和平的生活。因此，中印和亚洲各国人民都一致坚决反对东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约之类的军事集团，也坚决反对帝国主义者强占台湾、果阿、西伊里安以及在亚洲许多国家建立军事基地、策划新战争。
    宋庆龄副委员长在德里市欢迎大会上表示，“印度人民在台湾问题上支持中国人民，就像我们在果阿问题上充分支持印度人民一样。”这是充分表达了中国人民的感情和立场的。
    尼赫鲁总理一再指责某些国家中有些人顽固地闭着眼睛不承认占世界人口近四分之一的中国的存在，并认为联合国要重整它的威信，要使许多困难的国际问题获得解决，必须恢复中国在联合国的合法地位。中国人民感谢这种正义的支持，我们认为这是充分表达了印度人民的感情和立场的。
    中印两国人民的深厚友谊，是保卫和平的一个巨大力量。几年来，由于我们两国和苏联以及其他许多国家的共同努力，已经使紧张的国际局势有所缓和。但是“冷战”政策的追求者显然还是不肯罢手，他们继续在欧亚各方面制造紧张局势。因此，我们还须要坚持不懈地作更大的努力。
    中国人民支持印度政府所提倡的集体和平的建议。我们希望亚洲和太平洋地区各国，包括美国在内，签订一个集体和平公约来代替目前存在着的对立性军事集团。中印两国人民和亚洲其他各国人民都要为这个理想积极奋斗。
    宋庆龄副委员长在访问印度之后，还要访问缅甸。这将使中、印、缅人民之间原有的深厚友谊获得进一步的发展，它对于亚洲各国人民维护和平的斗争都会给与有力的鼓舞。
