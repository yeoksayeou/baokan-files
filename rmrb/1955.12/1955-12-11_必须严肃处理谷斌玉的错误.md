To the Editors:

On October 21st, the "Beijing Youth Daily" exposed the serious incident of Gu Binyu, the former principal (and Party branch secretary) of Chaoyangmen Primary School in Beijing, violating laws and discipline and abusing children. This incident occurred one morning in the winter of 1952. That day, Gu Binyu received a phone call from her husband, Shen Jinxi (also known as Ma Hui, head of the Local Industry Section of the Industrial Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee), saying that he had lost his pen at the school. Therefore, she immediately went to each class and ordered the teachers to stop teaching and conduct a general search of students' schoolbags, drawers, and pencil boxes, and did not allow the students to go home even after school hours. When Wu Yongfa, a second-grade student, went home a step earlier, Gu Binyu regarded him as a thief and had someone call Wu Yongfa back for illegal interrogation and searches. Under the threats and coercion of Gu Binyu and others, Wu Yongfa was so frightened that he had to lie and say that he had taken the pen. Gu Binyu immediately sent people to rummage through his home, but they did not find the pen. As a result, after the matter was brought to the Zhugan Lane Police Station, it was determined through investigation and verification by the police station that Wu Yongfa had not taken the pen. Afterwards, Gu Binyu never mentioned the matter again; it turned out that her husband's pen had not been lost at all.

Although this incident happened three years ago, the serious consequences have persisted until recently. Wu Yongfa, an innocent child, was not only unreasonably detained and tortured for more than nine hours by Gu Binyu and others that day, without eating lunch or dinner, but also has been wearing the label of "thief" for three years, receiving cold looks from teachers at school and being scolded by his parents at home. He gradually became withdrawn and lifeless, often skipping school and sometimes wandering the streets for days and nights without returning home. He has been held back twice in the past three years, and has not been admitted to the Young Pioneers for these reasons.

What is particularly infuriating is that some staff members in the relevant leading organs of Dongdan District were aware of Gu Binyu's serious misconduct of violating laws and discipline and abusing children. However, they actually didn't care about this matter at all, and even talked about it as a joke during their leisure time!

Not long ago, the "Beijing Youth Daily" discovered this incident. Before publicly exposing it in the newspaper, they had discussed the detailed course of events with the Dongdan District Committee of the Communist Party of China; after the exposure, they also told the District Committee the results of further investigations and a large amount of material. But until now, this incident has not been seriously dealt with. It is said that the District Committee asked Gu Binyu to verify the situation, and Gu Binyu denied that such a fact existed, and Shen Jinxi also helped Gu Binyu say this. However, the accusations of the person concerned (Wu Yongfa and his parents) and the evidence of witnesses (the person in charge of Zhugan Lane Police Station and relevant teachers and students of Chaoyangmen Primary School, etc.) can refute Gu Binyu's shameless denial. The attitude of the Dongdan District Culture and Education Section is even more intolerable. Gu Binyu's misconduct has been going on for three years, and they have not taken any action; who knows, when the "Beijing Youth Daily" was about to expose this matter, they proposed to wait until after the matter was dealt with before publishing it. The reason is: "Otherwise, we will be passive!" When Gu Binyu tried to deny the facts exposed by the "Beijing Youth Daily," they said with relief: "There are discrepancies in the situation!" And when the "Beijing Youth Daily" presented the results of the second investigation and verification and the masses' accusations to the person in charge of the Culture and Education Section, he frowned and shouted, "Passive! Passive!" But afterwards, they still did not actively take the initiative to deal with this incident!

It should be pointed out that Gu Binyu's misconduct is not limited to this one incident. Since she came to Chaoyangmen Primary School as principal in 1949, she has not cared about educational work, but has treated teachers as servants. She often didn't get up until the teachers had taught several classes; sometimes she would shout "my back hurts" in the evening and ask teachers to massage her back until late at night; when she was in a bad mood, she would use abusive language to insult teachers. When some teachers criticized her, she took measures to suppress them. When she could no longer stay at Chaoyangmen Primary School, the Dongdan District Culture and Education Section transferred her to Suzhou Hutong Primary School as principal. In Suzhou Hutong Primary School, Gu Binyu continued to act recklessly, causing a very bad political impact among the masses. The Dongdan District Culture and Education Section was also aware of these situations, and the Dongdan District Committee had also conducted a special investigation; however, they did not take effective measures in time to correct Gu Binyu's mistakes.

We demand that the Dongdan District Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Dongdan District Culture and Education Section immediately seriously deal with Gu Binyu's criminal behavior of abusing children, and conscientiously examine the erroneous attitude they have shown in handling Gu Binyu's case.

### 必须严肃处理谷斌玉的错误

    必须严肃处理谷斌玉的错误编辑同志：
    十月二十一日，“北京青年报”揭发了北京市朝阳门小学前校长谷斌玉（兼党支部书记）违法乱纪、摧残儿童的严重事件。这个事件发生在一九五二年冬天的一个上午。那天，谷斌玉接到她爱人申今锡（又名马慧，是中共北京市委工业部地方工业处处长）的电话，说是他的钢笔丢在学校里了。于是，她马上到各班让正在上课的教师停止上课，普遍搜查学生的书包、抽屉和铅笔盒等，并且到了放学的时间还不让学生们回家。二年级学生吴永发先一步回了家，谷斌玉就把他当成小偷，让人把吴永发叫回来，非法进行审问和搜查。在谷斌玉等人的威胁和逼迫下，吴永发吓得只好撒谎说自己拿了钢笔。谷斌玉马上派人到他家里翻箱倒柜，也没有找到钢笔。结果，这个问题闹到了竹竿巷派出所以后，经过派出所调查对证，才断定吴永发并没有拿钢笔。以后，谷斌玉再也没有提起这件事，原来她爱人的钢笔根本就没有丢。
    这件事情虽然是三年以前发生的，但是造成的严重后果却一直留到最近。吴永发这个无辜的孩子，不但在那天被谷斌玉等无理软禁和折磨了九个多小时，午饭和晚饭都没有吃；而且三年来一直戴着“小偷”的帽子，在学校里受到老师们的白眼，在家里被父母责骂。他逐渐变得性情孤僻，死气沉沉，不但常常逃学，有时还几天几夜不回家而流浪街头。他三年来留了两次级，而且因为这些理由没有被吸收入少年先锋队。
    特别令人愤慨的是，谷斌玉这种违法乱纪、摧残儿童的严重错误行为，东单区有关领导机关里的某些工作人员是知道的。但是，他们居然对这件事毫不在意，甚至当做茶余饭后的笑料来闲谈！
    不久以前，“北京青年报”发现了这个事件。在报上公开揭发以前，他们曾经向中共东单区委会谈过事情的详细经过；在揭发以后，又把进一步调查的结果和大批材料告诉了区委会。但是直到现在，这个事件还没有得到严肃的处理。据说，区委会找谷斌玉对证过情况，谷斌玉否认有这样的事实，申今锡也帮着谷斌玉这样说。但是，当事人（吴永发及其家长）的控诉，见证人（竹竿巷派出所负责人和朝阳门小学有关师生等）的证明，都可以驳斥谷斌玉这种无耻的抵赖。东单区文教科的态度更是令人不能容忍。谷斌玉的错误行为从发生到现在已经三年了，他们一直不作处理；谁知道，等“北京青年报”要揭发这件事了，他们却提出要等处理以后再发表。理由是：“不然我们要被动”了！当谷斌玉企图抵赖“北京青年报”所揭发的事实的时候，他们又欣慰地说：“情况有出入吧！”而当“北京青年报”把第二次调查对证的结果和群众的检举材料摆在文教科负责人面前的时候，他又皱着眉头嚷叫“被动！被动！”但是，以后却仍然没有积极主动地来处理这个事件！
    应该指出，谷斌玉的错误行为并不只是这一件事情。一九四九年她到朝阳门小学当校长以来，对教育工作不管不问，却把教师们当奴婢使唤。她经常到教师们上了几堂课才起床；有时候在晚上却高嚷“腰酸”而让教师给她捶背到深夜；脾气一来就拿一些不堪入耳的话来辱骂教师。有的教师对她提出批评，她就采取打击压制的手段。当她在朝阳门小学待不下去的时候，东单区文教科就把她调到苏州胡同小学当校长。在苏州胡同小学里，谷斌玉仍然胡作非为，在群众中又造成了很坏的政治影响。对于这些情况，东单区文教科也是了解的，东单区委会还专门进行过调查；可是他们都没有及时采取有效的措施来纠正谷斌玉的错误。
    我们要求中共东单区委和东单区文教科立即严肃处理谷斌玉摧残儿童的犯罪行为，并且认真检查他们处理谷斌玉的问题中所表现的错误态度。
