    Insecticide That Doesn't Kill Insects
    Not long ago, Party organizations, agricultural technology extension stations, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and some cotton farmers in various parts of Jiangxi Province wrote to the Jiangxi Daily, saying that the Jiangxi Agricultural Pharmaceutical Factory had sold them pesticides that did not kill pests, causing great damage to agricultural production. For example, in August, the cotton fields in Pengze County were attacked by insect pests. The farmers used the pesticide produced by the Jiangxi Agricultural Pharmaceutical Factory to kill the insects. People sprayed the pesticide in front, but the insects continued to fly behind them. After spraying three, four, or even ten times, they saw little effect. Because of this, the cotton fields that were attacked by insect pests suffered a yield reduction of at least 20%. In one area of Jiangbei District in Pengze County, it is estimated that the yield of seed cotton was reduced by more than 1,237,000 jin. As for the waste of manpower and resources, it is impossible to calculate.
    Why did this phenomenon occur? It turns out that in order to fraudulently obtain honors and get more enterprise bonus funds, the factory used methods of cutting corners to "overfulfill" the plan. In 1955, the factory's 25% "DDT" emulsion did not follow the regulations for the use of materials, and it used a total of more than 17,000 jin less of raw materials such as camphor oil, castor oil, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda.
    Supplying farmers with low-quality pesticides, causing them to suffer losses in production, is an act that harms the worker-peasant alliance. The Jiangxi Agricultural Pharmaceutical Factory should immediately correct this error and produce more and better pesticides for our farmer brothers!

    杀虫药不杀虫
    不久前，江西省各地的党组织、农业技术推广站、农业生产合作社和一些棉农纷纷写信给江西日报说：江西农业药剂制造厂把杀不死害虫的农药卖给了他们，给农业生产带来了很大损害。例如：八月间，彭泽县的棉田遭到了虫害。农民就用江西农业药剂制造厂出产的药剂来杀虫。人在前边喷药水，虫子还在后面飞，喷药喷过三、四次到十来次，也看不见多大效果。由于这个原因，遭到了虫害的棉田，起码要减产百分之二十。彭泽县江北区一个地方，估计减产籽棉一百二十三万七千多斤。至于人力、物力的浪费，更无法来计算了。
    为什么会出现这种现象呢？原来这个厂为了骗取荣誉，多得企业奖励基金，就采用偷工减料的办法来“超额”完成计划。一九五五年，这个厂所生产的百分之二十五“滴滴涕”乳剂，没有按照用料的规定，少用了原料、樟油、蓖麻油、硫酸、烧碱等共达一万七千多斤。
    把低劣质量的农药供给农民，使农民在生产上受到损失，是一种损害工农联盟的行为。江西农业药剂制造厂应该立即纠正这种错误，为农民兄弟们生产出更多更好的农药来！
