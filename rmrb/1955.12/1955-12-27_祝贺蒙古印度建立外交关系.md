    Congratulations on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between Mongolia and India

    The governments of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Republic of India announced on the 24th that the two countries have decided to establish diplomatic relations and exchange diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level. This marks a new historical stage in the friendly and cooperative relations between Mongolia and India. The Chinese people heartily congratulate and rejoice at the establishment of diplomatic relations and the consolidation of friendly ties between Mongolia and India!

    The establishment of diplomatic relations and the strengthening of friendly cooperation between Mongolia and India are based on a solid foundation. The people of Mongolia and India are both peace-loving, and both countries pursue policies that favor peace, advocate for strengthened international cooperation, and strive to ease international tensions. In the struggle against imperialist aggression, the people of Mongolia and India have always sympathized with and supported each other. Therefore, the differences in the political and social systems of the two countries will not hinder the development of friendly and cooperative relations between them. The establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries will further promote the deepening of friendship between the two peoples, which not only conforms to the interests and aspirations of the people of Mongolia and India, but is also an important factor in maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

    In recent years, India's efforts to promote international cooperation and strive for peace have been universally praised and admired by fair-minded people in various countries. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, jointly advocated by the Prime Ministers of India and China, have been accepted by an increasing number of countries. India's efforts in seeking peace in Korea and Indochina, and its active initiation and participation in the Asian-African Conference, have made important contributions to the cause of peace in Asia. Through mutual visits by state leaders, the friendly relations between India and the Soviet Union, and with our country, have been strengthened as never before. At the United Nations conferences, India has waged unremitting struggles to uphold the spirit and principles of the United Nations Charter, has consistently adhered to a just and righteous position on various issues conducive to peace, and has made great efforts to support the entry of the Mongolian People's Republic into the United Nations. Now, India's establishment of diplomatic relations with Mongolia is a concrete application of the principle of peaceful coexistence and another important step in promoting international peace and cooperation. Regardless of the shameless slander of some countries, India has unswervingly engaged in the cause of international peace, enhancing India's international prestige, and it occupies an increasingly important position in international affairs.

    Throughout its more than thirty years of glorious independent history, the Mongolian People's Republic has consistently pursued a policy of peace, and it has made great contributions to peace in Asia and the world. During World War II, it stood at the forefront of the struggle in crushing Japanese imperialist aggression. It played an important role in stopping aggression and maintaining peace and security in Asia and the Pacific region. Since the end of the war, it has consistently and actively participated in the struggle for peace, and has engaged in large-scale economic and cultural construction work, achieving unprecedented success. The Mongolian People's Republic has already established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China, as well as many countries in Europe and Asia, and now the establishment of diplomatic relations with India proves that its international status has been consolidated and that it will increasingly play an important role in international affairs.

    However, in order to maintain and exacerbate world tensions, the United States, in disregard of the provisions of the United Nations Charter, has repeatedly attempted in the United Nations General Assembly to obliterate the legal status of the Mongolian People's Republic and deprive it of its legitimate rights in the United Nations. The fact that the Mongolian People's Republic has not yet entered the United Nations, this world organization, is not only extremely unfair, but also seriously damages the credibility of the United Nations. At the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly, the recommendation to admit eighteen new member states, including the Mongolian People's Republic, was adopted by an overwhelming majority of votes. The United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's illegal deprivation of the Mongolian People's Republic's entry into the United Nations was condemned by the majority of United Nations member states and broad sections of fair-minded world public opinion, which further proves that the Mongolian People's Republic's legitimate status in the United Nations cannot be deprived. Facts have proved that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's obstruction of the Mongolian People's Republic from obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations is a disastrous political and moral failure for them, and all fair-minded public opinion advocates expelling the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, who do not represent anyone, from the United Nations.

    The existence and development of the Mongolian People's Republic cannot be obliterated or stopped by any reactionary forces. The friendly relations between the Mongolian People's Republic and Asian countries are growing stronger. Its establishment of diplomatic relations with India, one of the major Asian countries, is a vivid new example. And the development of friendship between the Mongolian People's Republic and Asian countries will surely promote the common prosperity of its economic and cultural development with Asian countries.

    The establishment of diplomatic relations between Mongolia and India, the recent visits of Soviet leaders to Asian countries, and the increase in friendly relations among Asian countries indicate that the unity of Asian countries has been further strengthened. This is of great significance for opposing colonialists' aggression in Asia, safeguarding the peace and independence of Asian countries, and strengthening friendship and economic and cultural construction among the people of Asian countries. It is becoming increasingly difficult for colonialists to divide the unity among the people of Asian countries. The era of colonialists showing off their power in Asia is long gone. The people of Asia must firmly grasp their own destiny and bravely advance on the road of mutual solidarity and friendly cooperation!

    The Chinese people firmly implement a policy of peaceful and friendly cooperation with the people of Asian countries, and feel particularly close to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Mongolia and India, two countries that have always been friendly to our country. In particular, the decision by the two governments that the Mongolian ambassador to our country will also serve as ambassador to India, and that the Indian ambassador to our country will also serve as ambassador to Mongolia, will further develop and consolidate the close friendship between our country and Mongolia and India. This friendship will surely make new contributions to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

### 祝贺蒙古印度建立外交关系

    祝贺蒙古印度建立外交关系
    蒙古人民共和国政府和印度共和国政府在二十四日宣布，两国决定建立外交关系，并互派大使级外交代表。这标志了蒙古和印度两国之间的友好合作关系已进入了新的历史阶段。中国人民对于蒙印两国邦交的建立和友好关系的巩固，衷心地表示祝贺和喜悦！
    蒙古和印度两国建立外交关系和加强友好合作，是有着深厚的基础的。蒙印两国人民都是爱好和平的人民，两国同样奉行着有利于和平的政策，主张加强国际合作，争取缓和国际紧张局势。在反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中，蒙印两国人民一直是互相同情和支持的。因此，两国虽然存在政治制度和社会制度的不同，完全不会妨碍它们之间友好合作关系的发展。两国邦交的建立，必将更加促进两国人民之间友谊的日益加深，这不仅符合蒙印两国人民的利益和愿望，而且是维护亚洲和世界和平的重要因素。
    这些年来，印度在推进国际合作和争取和平的斗争中所作的努力，受到了各国公正人士普遍的赞扬和钦佩。印度总理和我国总理共同倡导的和平共处的原则，已为越来越多的国家所接受。印度在谋求朝鲜和印度支那和平中的努力，它的积极发起和参加亚非会议，是对亚洲和平事业的重要贡献。通过国家领导人的互相访问，印度和苏联、和我国的友好关系已经空前加强。印度在联合国会议上，为维护联合国宪章的精神和原则进行了坚持不懈的斗争，在各种有利于和平的问题上始终坚持了严正的立场，并对支持蒙古人民共和国进入联合国作了很大的努力。现在，印度同蒙古建立外交关系，更是和平共处原则的具体运用，是促进国际和平合作的又一重要步骤。印度不顾有一些国家的无耻诽谤，坚持不渝地从事国际和平事业，提高了印度的国际威望，它在国际事务中居于越来越重要的地位。
    蒙古人民共和国在它三十多年独立的光荣历史中，始终奉行着和平政策，它对亚洲和世界的和平作了很大的贡献。在第二次世界大战期间，它在粉碎日本帝国主义侵略的战争中，一直站在斗争的最前列。它对于制止侵略、维护亚洲和太平洋地区的和平和安全，起了重要的作用。战后以来，它一贯积极地参加争取和平的斗争，并大规模地从事国家的经济和文化建设工作，取得了空前的成就。蒙古人民共和国已经同苏联和中国以及欧洲和亚洲的许多国家建立了外交关系，现在又同印度建立了邦交，证明它的国际地位已经巩固，在国际事务中将日益发挥它的重要作用。
    可是，美国为了维持和加剧世界紧张局势，居然不顾联合国宪章的规定，在联合国大会中一再企图抹煞蒙古人民共和国的法律地位，剥夺蒙古人民共和国在联合国中的应有的合法权利。蒙古人民共和国至今还没有进入联合国这个世界组织，不仅是异常不公平的，而且使联合国的威信受到了严重的损害。第十届联合国大会在表决接纳包括蒙古人民共和国在内的十八个新会员国建议的时候，得到绝大多数票的通过。而美国和蒋介石卖国集团非法剥夺蒙古人民共和国进入联合国，就遭到大多数联合国会员国和世界广大公正舆论的谴责，这更证明蒙古人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位是不容剥夺的。事实证明，美国和蒋介石卖国集团阻止蒙古人民共和国取得在联合国的合法地位，是它们在政治上和道义上的惨重失败，一切公正舆论都主张从联合国中驱除不代表任何人的蒋介石卖国集团分子。
    蒙古人民共和国的存在和发展，是任何反动势力所抹煞不了和阻止不住的。蒙古人民共和国同亚洲国家的友好关系正在日益加强。它同亚洲大国之一的印度建立外交关系，就是生动的新的例证。而蒙古人民共和国同亚洲国家友谊的发展，必将促进它和亚洲国家经济和文化的共同繁荣。
    蒙古和印度建立外交关系，苏联领袖最近访问亚洲国家，以及亚洲各国之间友好关系的增进，说明亚洲国家的团结有了进一步的加强。这对于反对殖民主义者在亚洲的侵略、保卫亚洲国家的和平和独立、加强亚洲各国人民之间的友谊和经济文化建设，都具有重大的意义。殖民主义者要想分裂亚洲各国人民间的团结，是越来越困难了。殖民主义在亚洲耀武扬威的时代早已过去，亚洲人民一定要紧紧地掌握住自己的命运，在互相团结和友好合作的道路上勇猛前进！
    中国人民坚定地执行同亚洲各国人民和平友好合作的政策，对于同我国一向友好相处的蒙古和印度两国建立外交关系，特别感到亲切。尤其是两国政府决定，蒙古驻我国大使将兼任驻印度大使，印度驻我国大使将兼任驻蒙古大使，必将使我国同蒙古和印度的密切友谊，得到进一步的发展和巩固。这种友谊对亚洲和世界的和平事业，一定会作出新的贡献。
