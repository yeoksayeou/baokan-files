Xinhua News Agency, December 8th—Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai received the following foreign guests in the afternoon of December 8th, who were invited to attend the Chinese Academy of Sciences 1955 Antibiotics Academic Conference: Soviet Academician Krasilnikov (Corresponding Academician) and Professor Savich, Romanian Academician of Virology Nicolaou, Polish antibiotic expert Dr. Kurilowicz, Japanese agricultural chemist Professor Yusuke Sumiki, Burmese pathologist Dr. Wu Kin Maung Win, Bulgarian mycologist Dr. Popov, Indonesian pharmacist Dr. Darman, Vietnamese bacteriologist Dr. Nguyen Van Huong, Mongolian candidate doctor of microbiology Yalinpir, Korean researcher Liu Ronggui, and Mr. Sternaby from Denmark.

Present at the reception were Li Siguang, Zhu Kezhen, and Wu Youxun, Vice Presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Xinhua News Agency, December 8th—The scientist representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Japan, Burma, Bulgaria, Indonesia, Mongolia, and North Korea, who were invited to Beijing to attend the 1955 Antibiotics Academic Conference, visited Peking University this morning accompanied by Chinese scientists. Professor Zhou Peiyuan, Provost of Peking University, received the guests and introduced them to the history and current situation of Peking University. Then, the guests visited the university's Department of Biology and Department of Chemistry. In the Department of Biology, the foreign scientists first browsed the library, which houses 11,000 books and scientific journals from various countries, and then visited the laboratories and research rooms of the Department of Biology and Department of Chemistry, including soil, animal biochemistry, human and animal physiology, botany, microbiology, organic chemistry, and the specimen rooms of animal and plant specimens and insect specimens. The guests watched the various experiments being conducted by the students and inquired about their studies. They were most interested in the directional enzyme experiment conducted by fourth-year students specializing in plant physiology in the microbiology laboratory using the latest Soviet method - vacuum infiltration. Professor Savich, a Soviet microbiologist who has made outstanding achievements in extracting antibiotics from lichens, was very pleased to see several lichen specimens displayed in the plant specimen room and inquired about their origin. When Dr. Yusuke Sumiki from Japan visited the inoculation room in the microbiology laboratory, he offered suggestions for improving the ultraviolet light lamp device in the inoculation room. Finally, the guests strolled and chatted by the "Weiming Lake" on the campus, which had a thin layer of ice. Dr. Wu Kin Maung Win from Burma, who had visited Oxford University in the United Kingdom, considered Peking University to be one of the best universities he had ever seen after visiting the research rooms, laboratory equipment, and school environment. While resting by the "Weiming Lake", Wu Kin Maung Win said to Dr. Darman from Indonesia: "This is truly a beautiful university."

On the 7th, foreign scientists visited the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and toured Beijing's scenic spots. In the evening, Soviet Academician Krasilnikov reported on the "Washington International Antibiotics Conference" to Chinese scientists attending the expanded meeting of the National Antibiotics Research Work Committee.

    周总理接见参加抗生素学术会议的外宾
    新华社八日讯　国务院总理周恩来八日下午接见了应邀参加中国科学院一九五五年抗生素学术会议的苏联微生物学家克拉西尔尼科夫通讯院士和萨维奇教授、罗马尼亚病毒学家尼古劳院士、波兰抗生素学家库里洛维奇博士、日本农业化学家住木谕介教授、缅甸病理学家吴钦茂温博士、保加利亚霉菌学家波波夫博士、印度尼西亚药学家达尔曼博士、越南细菌学家阮文享博士、蒙古微生物学家雅林皮尔候补博士、朝鲜刘荣圭研究员以及丹麦的斯特纳比亚先生。
    接见时在座的有中国科学院副院长李四光、竺可桢、吴有训。
    新华社八日讯　应邀前来北京参加一九五五年抗生素学术会议的苏联、波兰、日本、缅甸、保加利亚、印度尼西亚、蒙古、朝鲜的科学家代表，今天上午在中国科学家的陪同下参观了北京大学。北京大学教务长周培源教授接待了这批客人，向他们介绍了北京大学的历史和目前的情况。然后，客人们参观了这个学校的生物学系和化学系。在生物学系，外国科学家们首先浏览了藏有一万一千册图书和各国科学期刊的图书室，然后参观了生物学系和化学系的土壤、动物生物化学、人体及动物生理学、植物学、微生物学、有机化学等学科的实验室和研究室以及动植物标本和昆虫标本陈列室。客人们观看了学生们正在进行的各种实验。并问起了他们的学习情形。他们对于植物生理专门化四年级学生在微生物学实验室中用苏联最新的方法——真空渗入法进行的酶的方向性实验最感兴趣。研究从地衣中提取抗生素有卓越成就的苏联微生物学家萨维奇教授看到了植物标本室里陈列的几份地衣标本，感到很高兴，并且询问了这些标本的来源。日本住木谕介博士参观微生物学实验室里的接种室的时候，对接种室的紫外线光灯的装置提出了改进的意见。最后客人们在校园里已经结了薄冰的“未名湖”畔散步漫谈。曾经参观过英国牛津大学的缅甸吴钦茂温博士在参观了研究室、实验室的设备和学校环境后，认为北京大学是他所看到过的最好的大学中的一个。在“未名湖”畔休息的时候，吴钦茂温对印度尼西亚达尔曼博士说：“这真是一个美丽的大学。”
    七日，外国科学家参观了国营北京第一棉纺织厂并且游览了北京的名胜。晚上，苏联克拉西尔尼科夫通讯院士向参加全国抗生素研究工作委员会扩大会议的中国科学家报告了“华盛顿国际抗生素会议”的情况。
