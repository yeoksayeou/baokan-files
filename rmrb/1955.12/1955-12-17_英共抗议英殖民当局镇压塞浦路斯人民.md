Xinhua News Agency, London, December 15th (TASS) – The Political Committee of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain has issued a statement strongly condemning the British policy of terror in Cyprus.

The statement said that the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus is under attack because it is the best defender of the interests of the Cypriot people and their right to self-determination. The statement went on to point out that all the leaders of the Pancyprian Federation of Labour had been arrested, which was "a shocking attack on the trade union movement."

The Political Committee called on the British working people and British trade unions to "express solidarity with their Cypriot brothers and sisters," and called on the British people to fight for the immediate release of the arrested Cypriots, demand democratic rights for the residents of Cyprus, and demand the withdrawal of British troops from the island of Cyprus.

    英共抗议英殖民当局镇压塞浦路斯人民
    新华社据塔斯社伦敦十五日讯  英国共产党执行委员会政治委员会发表声明，严厉谴责英国在塞浦路斯执行的恐怖政策。
    声明说，塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党所以遭到攻击是因为它是塞浦路斯居民利益和他们自决权的最好的维护者。声明接着指出，全塞浦路斯总工会的全部领袖都被逮捕了，这是“对工会运动惊人的进攻”。
    政治委员会号召英国劳动人民和英国各工会“声援塞浦路斯的兄弟姊妹们”，并且号召英国人争取立即释放被捕的塞浦路斯人，要求给予塞浦路斯居民民主权利和从塞浦路斯岛撤退英国军队。
