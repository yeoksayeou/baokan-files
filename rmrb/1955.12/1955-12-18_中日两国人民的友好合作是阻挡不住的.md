The recent visits to China by many Japanese non-governmental organizations have resulted in numerous agreements with corresponding Chinese non-governmental organizations concerning the promotion of friendship, trade, and cultural exchange between the peoples of China and Japan. These agreements reflect the common desire of the Chinese and Japanese people to enhance their friendship and cooperation, as well as their efforts to achieve the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations as soon as possible. Therefore, they have received the heartfelt support and welcome of the people of both countries.

Of course, for those who fear the rapprochement and understanding between the Chinese and Japanese people, these agreements are a thorn in their side. Because the growth of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people will inevitably lead to the failure of their conspiracy of "Asians fighting Asians." This is why the U.S. government has expressed dissatisfaction with the various agreements signed by Chinese and Japanese non-governmental organizations, and even openly lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government in the manner of a "master."

However, for the Japanese government, which bears responsibility to the Japanese people, it should have its own position on the various agreements reached by Chinese and Japanese non-governmental organizations. According to common sense, it should adopt the same attitude as the Japanese people, rather than the same attitude as the U.S. State Department. However, the current situation is that the Japanese people welcome these agreements, while some people in the Japanese government are following the demands of the United States and opposing them.

Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu recently said in the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet that the Japanese government refuses to "bear any responsibility" for the agreements reached by Chinese and Japanese non-governmental organizations. Prior to this, according to Japanese newspapers, Shigemitsu even stated at a Japanese Cabinet meeting on November 29 that he would "actively counter" the actions of Chinese and Japanese non-governmental organizations in concluding various agreements, and that it was necessary to "restrict" Japanese non-governmental organizations from coming to China for this purpose. Reportedly, Shigemitsu believes that activities carried out by private organizations in China are "improper" when Sino-Japanese relations have not been normalized. He believes that outstanding issues between China and Japan should be resolved through direct negotiations between the two governments at such times. However, he also stated that Japan's policy of refusing to restore normal relations with China "will not change."

Shigemitsu's attitude is quite bizarre. Everyone knows that the Japanese government has consistently ignored the Chinese government's proposals for restoring normal Sino-Japanese relations. It is precisely this situation that has prompted Japanese non-governmental organizations to voluntarily seek agreements with Chinese non-governmental organizations to resolve issues between the two countries in areas such as trade, fisheries, repatriation of expatriates, and cultural exchange. Now Shigemitsu neither wants to resolve the issues through direct negotiations between the two governments, nor does he want to resolve them through agreements between Chinese and Japanese non-governmental organizations. In short, Shigemitsu does not want to resolve any of the outstanding issues between China and Japan.

In this way, Shigemitsu has made it clear that he is not considering the interests of the Japanese people, but the interests of the U.S. State Department's "Cold War" policy.

Facts have proven that the various agreements reached by Chinese and Japanese non-governmental organizations are in the interests of the people of both China and Japan. Although some agreements have not been fully implemented due to obstruction by the Japanese government, these agreements have already brought great benefits to the people of both countries, especially the Japanese people.

Restoring Sino-Japanese trade is a matter of great concern to the Japanese people. Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi recently pointed out that trade with China "is of great significance." On this issue, Chinese and Japanese non-governmental organizations have signed four agreements since 1952. On June 1, 1952, Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, signed the first Sino-Japanese trade agreement with Japanese representatives Tomi Kora, Kei Hoashi, and Kisuke Miyakoshi. On October 29, 1953, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade signed the second Sino-Japanese trade agreement with a delegation from the Japanese "Diet Members' League for Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade." Due to the Japanese government's pursuit of the U.S. "embargo" policy, only 5.05 percent of the total trade volume stipulated in the first trade agreement was executed, and only 38.8 percent of the total trade volume stipulated in the second trade agreement was executed. However, China's exports completed 50.41 percent of the total agreement, of which Class A commodities such as soybeans and coal, which Japan urgently needed, accounted for 37.37 percent of the total agreement, exceeding the proportion stipulated in the agreement. China also exported Class B and C commodities such as salt and tung oil, which Japan needed. On the other hand, Japan's exports only completed 27.19 percent of the total agreement, and there were no Class A commodities that China needed most.

On May 4, 1955, the Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan signed the third Sino-Japanese trade agreement with the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade and the Japanese "Diet Members' League for Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade." Subsequently, in late May, the Chinese side took the initiative to offer 50,000 tons of soybeans, a Class A commodity, to the Japanese side and lowered the price. However, the Japanese government did not allow Japanese merchants to exchange goods of the same type, and deliberately distorted China's goodwill, delaying the issue for two months.

On October 15, 1955, the Japanese business community delegation visiting China signed 290 specific trade contracts with Chinese import and export companies, with a total value of over 12 million pounds, of which Japanese exports totaled over 9 million pounds.

All these trade agreements and their implementation show that they are extremely beneficial to the Japanese people. If the Japanese government did not use the notorious "embargo" policy to obstruct the implementation of the agreements, the people of China and Japan would benefit even more. This is a very obvious thing.

The situation is the same in terms of fisheries. The agreement on fisheries in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea signed on April 15, 1955, by the delegation of the Japan-China Fisheries Association and the delegation of the China Fisheries Association not only protected the fish resources in the region, but also brought great benefits to Japanese fishermen, enabling them to find a way out of the predicament caused by the U.S. destruction of the Japanese fishing industry. Even "The New York Times" could not help but admit on October 26 that Japanese fishermen "expressed happiness" with the agreement. It said, "In the Yellow Sea, the boundaries for fishing by the ships of the two countries have been demarcated, with the result that the Japanese are getting more and cheaper fish."

As for the agreements reached by the Chinese Red Cross Society and relevant Japanese non-governmental organizations in assisting with the repatriation of expatriates from both countries, the results are known to every Japanese person. Nearly 30,000 expatriates who have returned to Japan are the best witnesses to the benefits of these agreements. Similarly, the more than 3,000 overseas Chinese who have returned to China will not forget the efforts made by the Japanese Red Cross Society and other relevant organizations in this regard.

### 中日两国人民的友好合作是阻挡不住的

    中日两国人民的友好合作是阻挡不住的
    蒋元椿
    最近，前来中国访问的许多日本民间团体，同相应的中国民间团体达成了不少有关促进中日两国人民之间的友好、贸易往来和文化交流的协议。这些协议反映了中日两国人民对于增进他们之间的友谊和合作的共同愿望，以及他们为早日实现中日关系正常化而作的努力，因此得到了中日两国人民的衷心支持和欢迎。
    当然，对于那些唯恐中日两国人民相互接近和了解的人来说，这些协议是他们的眼中钉。因为中日两国人民之间的友谊的增长，必然会使得他们的“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋遭到失败。这也就是为什么美国政府对于中日两国民间团体签订的各项协议要表示不满，甚至公然以“主子”的态度向日本政府提出强硬的抗议。
    但是在对日本人民负有责任的日本政府来说，它对于中日民间团体所达成的各项协议应该有自己的立场。按照通常的道理，它应当采取同日本人民一致的态度，而不是同美国国务院一致的态度。然而现在却出现了这样的情况：日本人民欢迎这些协议，而日本政府中有些人却遵从美国的要求，反对这些协议。
    日本外务相重光葵不久以前在日本国会众议院预算委员会上说，日本政府拒绝对中日民间团体所达成的协议“担负任何责任”。在此以前，据日本报纸报道，重光葵在十一月二十九日的日本内阁会议上甚表示，他要“积极地反击”中日民间团体缔结各种协议的行动，为此就必须“限制”日本民间团体到中国来。据说，重光葵认为，在中日关系没有恢复正常化的时候，私人团体在中国进行的活动是“不正当的”。他认为，在这样的时候，中日之间悬而未决的问题应当通过两国政府的直接谈判来解决。然而同时他又表示，日本拒绝同中国恢复正常关系的政策“不会改变”。
    重光葵的这种态度是十分离奇的。谁都知道，日本政府对于中国政府提出的关于恢复中日关系正常化的建议一直置之不理。正是这种情况促使日本民间团体自动起来同中国民间团体寻求协议，以解决中日两国之间在贸易、渔业、撤退侨民、文化交流等方面的问题。现在重光葵却既不想通过两国政府的直接谈判来解决问题，也不想让中日民间团体之间通过协议来解决问题。一句话，重光葵不想解决中日之间悬而未决的任何问题。
    重光葵这样就表明了，他所考虑的并不是日本人民的利益，而是美国国务院的“冷战”政策的利益。
    事实已经证明，中日两国民间团体所达成的各项协议，是符合于中日两国人民的利益的。尽管由于日本政府的阻挠，某些协议没有能够全部执行，但是这些协议已经给中日两国人民、特别是日本人民带来了极大的好处。
    恢复中日贸易是日本人民极其关心的事情。日本政府的通商产业省大臣石桥湛山最近还指出，同中国进行贸易“具有极大的意义”。在这个问题上，中日两国民间团体从一九五二年以来已经先后签订了四次协议。一九五二年六月一日，中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸同日本方面的代表高良富、帆足计、宫腰喜助签订了第一次中日贸易协议。一九五三年十月二十九日，中国国际贸易促进委员会同日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”代表团签订了第二次中日贸易协议。由于日本政府追随美国的“禁运”政策，第一次贸易协议只执行了规定双方贸易总额的百分之五点零五，第二次贸易协议只执行了规定双方贸易总额的百分之三十八点八。但是中国方面的出口完成了总协议的百分之五十点四一，其中日本所迫切需要的大豆、煤等甲类商品占协议总额的百分之三十七点三七，超过了协议所规定的比例。中国还输出给了日本以它所需要的盐、桐油等乙、丙类商品。而日本方面的出口只完成了总协议的百分之二十七点一九，而且完全没有中国所最需要的甲类商品。
    一九五五年五月四日，中国访问日本贸易代表团同日本国际贸易促进协议会、日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”签订了第三次中日贸易协定。接着，中国方面就在五月下旬主动表示愿意向日本方面提供属于甲类物资的大豆五万吨，并且降低了价格。日本政府却不许日本商人以同类的货物交换，并且故意歪曲中国的好意，使问题拖延了两个月之久。
    一九五五年十月十五日，日本工商界访华代表团同中国各进出口公司签订了二百九十个具体贸易合同，总值一千二百多万英镑，其中日本出口总值为九百多万英镑。
    所有这些贸易协议和它们的执行情况，都说明它们对于日本人民是极其有利的。如果日本政府不用臭名远扬的“禁运”政策来对协议的执行加以阻挠，中日两国人民得到的好处就会更多。这是很明显的事情。
    就渔业方面来说，情形也是这样。一九五五年四月十五日日本日中渔业协议会代表团同中国渔业协会代表团所签订的关于黄海、东海渔业的协定，不但保护了这一地区的鱼类资源，并且给日本渔民带来了极大的利益，使他们从美国摧残日本渔业所造成的绝境中找到了出路。甚至“纽约时报”在十月二十六日也不能不承认，日本渔民对这个协定“表示高兴”。它说，“在黄海中，划分了两国渔船捕鱼的界限，结果是，日本人得到更多的更便宜的鱼。”
    至于中国红十字会和日本有关的民间团体在协助遣返两国侨民方面所达成的协议，其结果是每一个日本人民都知道的。将近三万名已经回到日本的侨民，是受到这些协议的好处的最好的见证人。同样，已经回到中国的三千多名华侨，也不会忘记日本红十字会等有关团体在这方面所作的努力。
    一九五五年十月十七日中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会秘书长彭真和日本国会议员访华团团长上林山荣吉发表的联合公报，以及一九五五年十一月十六日中国人民外交学会秘书长和日本拥护宪法国民联合会秘书长发表的联合公报，都表达了中日两国人民对于恢复中日邦交的热烈愿望，对于中日两国的友好合作将有远大的影响。正如上林山荣吉团长在十一月十一日给周恩来总理的信中所指出的，“……我们已把相互有利的事项明确地写在联合公报之中。我们相信今后两国应该了解彼此的立场，加强友好关系，并为真正的和平有所贡献。这对彼此双方都是光荣的。”
    日本医学代表团和中华医学会在十一月七日签订的友好协议，日本工会代表团和中华全国总工会在十一月二十七日就有关工人运动的各项问题达成的协议，以及日本拥护宪法国民联合会和中国人民对外文化协会在同日就有关文化交流各项问题达成的协议，对于一向被称为同文同种、并且是紧邻的中日两国人民来说，当然是十分有利的。日本医学代表团团长阿部胜马在回国时在香港谈到和中华医学会签订的协议时就说：“中国和日本有好几种共同特有的地方性病症，是其他国家所没有发生的。因此，中日两国医学专家的合作是很重要的。”
    事情很清楚，中日两国民间团体之间所达成的各项协议，没有一项不是既对中国人民有利，也对日本人民有利的。中国政府是全力支持这些协议，协助这些协议的执行的。日本政府如果关心日本人民的利益，就也应当支持这些协议，给这些协议的执行提供便利的条件。日本政府尤其应当响应中国政府的建议，就恢复中日邦交问题同中国政府举行谈判，使中日之间的各项问题能够从现在的民间团体的水平提高到政府的水平来解决。这正是日本广大人民所要求的事情，也是中国人民所愿望的事情。
    然而，重光葵在日本国会和日本内阁会议上的言论却表明，他把美国垄断集团的利益看得远远重于日本人民的利益。这不能不说是一个自称要奉行独立的外交政策的政府的耻辱。但是，重光葵之流是阻挡不了中日两国人民之间的友好和往来的。今天是条条大路通向和平和友好合作的时代。中日两国民间团体的交往，已经给中日友好关系的恢复开辟了道路。重光葵之流在这条道路上竭力铺设的任何障碍，必然要被日本人民的坚定而有力的步伐踏得粉碎。
