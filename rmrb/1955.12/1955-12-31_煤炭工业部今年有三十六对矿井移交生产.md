Xinhua News Agency, December 30th. The Ministry of Coal Industry has put thirty-six pairs of newly built, renovated, and restored mine shafts into production this year. Adding the thirty-nine pairs of mine shafts put into production in the past two years, the total designed capacity of newly built, renovated, and restored mine shafts in the first three years has exceeded the planned target for the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan by 14.8 percent. After these mine shafts reach their full designed capacity, their coal production will account for more than 50 percent of the national state-owned coal mines' raw coal production in 1952.

The large-scale Hegang New No. 1 Mine (i.e., Dongshan Vertical Shaft) and Liaoyuan Xi'an Mine (i.e., Central Vertical Shaft) were put into production in the second half of this year. These two pairs of vertical shafts are modern, new-type vertical shafts built with Soviet assistance to China, following the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine. After inspection and appraisal, these mine shafts have proven to be of excellent engineering quality and fully meet the requirements for transfer to production. Among the mine shafts transferred to production this year are also larger mine shafts designed by China itself, such as the Jixi Xiaohengshan Vertical Shaft and the Shuangyashan Lingxi Vertical Shaft.

In order to meet the needs of industrial development, the coal industry sector has continued to restore and renovate existing mine shafts while accelerating the construction of new shafts in the past few years. Restored and renovated mine shafts account for 59 percent of the mine shafts transferred to production this year. These mine shafts require less investment and can be put into production more quickly. Mines such as the Fengfeng Dongda Mine and the Fuxin Xinqiu East No. 4 Pit and East No. 5 Pit have been restored to production in just over a year, and the state's investment in them is half that of building new mine shafts of the same scale.

    煤炭工业部今年有三十六对矿井移交生产
    新华社三十日讯　煤炭工业部今年有三十六对新建、改建和恢复的矿井投入了生产。加上过去两年中投入生产的三十九对矿井，三年中新建、改建和恢复的矿井的总的设计能力，已经超过第一个五年计划中头三年计划百分之十四点八。这些矿井全部达到设计能力以后，产煤数量将达一九五二年全国国营煤矿原煤产量的百分之五十以上。
    规模巨大的鹤岗新一矿（即东山竖井）和辽源西安矿（即中央竖井）都在今年下半年投入了生产。这两对竖井是继阜新海州露天煤矿之后，由苏联帮助中国建成的现代化的新型竖井。这些矿井经过验收和鉴定以后，证明工程的质量优良，完全达到了移交生产的要求。在今年移交生产的矿井中，还有由中国自己设计的鸡西小恒山竖井和双鸭山岭西竖井等较大的矿井。
    煤炭工业部门为了满足工业发展的需要，过去几年来在加速建设新井的同时，还继续对原有矿井进行了恢复和改建。在今年移交生产的矿井中，恢复和改建矿井占到百分之五十九。这些矿井需要的投资少，投入生产的时间较快。峰峰东大井和阜新新邱东四坑、东五坑等矿井，都只是用了一年多的时间就恢复了生产，而国家对它的投资却比新建同样规模的矿井节省了一半。
