    Do Not Graze Livestock in Wheat Fields
    To the Editor:
    Currently, wheat seedlings are growing very well in various places. In some areas, farmers, in order to save feed, drive cattle, sheep, and other livestock into the wheat fields for grazing. They believe that doing so can prevent the wheat seedlings from growing too vigorously, so they won't lack stamina later on; or they think that livestock eating green is an old habit of many years, and that eating it this year will allow them to grow even better next year, which is beneficial to the harvest.
    In fact, these ideas are all wrong. We know that wheat seedlings contain a hydrocyanic acid toxin, and livestock are prone to bloating and dysentery after eating them, and some even die as a result. It is not worth the loss to save some feed and let the livestock eat green! In addition, wheat seedlings are very tender and easily trampled by livestock hooves, and the soil in the wheat fields will also be compacted by livestock, which will affect the greening and growth of wheat. Also, when some livestock eat wheat seedlings, they often pull them up by the roots, which will cause missing seedlings and broken ridges, reducing wheat production. Here is a practical example: Sun Yepu, a farmer from Laoying Village, Ninth District, Zou County, Shandong Province, planted two mu of late-planted wheat last year. These two mu of wheat were originally growing very well, but later because he allowed sheep and chickens to eat them, the yield was 60 jin less per mu compared to wheat with the same cultivation conditions. In addition, according to experiments conducted by the Shandong Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences: grazing livestock in wheat fields generally reduces wheat production by about 10%, and the reduction is even greater in wheat fields with poor soil and little fertilization.
    Recently, the Fucheng County People's Committee of Shandong Province, in order to strictly prohibit cattle and sheep from eating wheat seedlings, called on villages to hold mass meetings to formulate wheat protection covenants; each agricultural cooperative established a seedling protection team to conduct patrols and inspections, and if cattle and sheep were found eating wheat seedlings, they would be taken to the livestock owner and the livestock owner would be educated. I think this is a very good method. In order to ensure a bumper wheat harvest next year and support the country's socialist construction, all localities should also take effective measures to prevent the practice of livestock eating green.

### 不要在麦田里放牧牲畜

    不要在麦田里放牧牲畜编辑同志：
    目前各地麦苗都长得很好。有些地方的农民为了节省饲料，把牛羊等牲畜赶入麦田放牧。他们以为这样做可以防止麦苗生长过旺，免得将来没后劲；或者认为牲畜吃青是多年的老习惯，今年吃了明年更能发棵子，对收成还有好处。
    其实，这些想法都是错误的。我们知道，麦苗中含有一种氰氢酸毒素，牲畜吃了容易涨肚子，生痢疾，有的甚至因而死亡了。想节省一些饲料而让牲畜吃青，结果是得不偿失！另外，麦苗很柔嫩，容易被牲畜蹄子踏坏，麦田的土壤也要被牲畜压实，这些都会影响小麦的还青和生长。还有些牲畜在吃麦苗的时候，常常把麦苗连根拔起，会造成缺苗断垅，减少小麦产量。这里可以举一个实际例子：山东邹县第九区老营村农民孙业朴，去年种了二亩晚茬小麦。这二亩小麦本来长的很好，后来因为他任凭羊、鸡啃吃，结果比起耕作条件相同的小麦来，每亩就少打了六十斤。另外，根据山东省农业科学研究所的试验：麦田里放牧牲畜，一般使小麦减产一成左右，特别是土壤瘠薄施肥少的麦田减产更多。
    最近山东省复程县人民委员会为了严禁牛羊啃吃麦苗，号召以村为单位召开群众会议，制定护麦公约；由各农业社建立护苗小组，进行巡逻检查，发现牛羊啃吃麦苗就将牛羊牵送畜主，并向畜主进行教育。我认为这个办法很好。为了保证明年小麦丰收，支援国家社会主义建设，各地也应该采取有效措施来防止牲畜吃青的做法。
