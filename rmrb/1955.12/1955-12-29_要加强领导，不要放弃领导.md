    Strengthen Leadership, Don't Abandon Leadership
    Lin Qi, Secretary of the Fengrun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province
    The scale of the agricultural cooperative movement is so large and its development so rapid, and our experience is still so limited. It is impossible for the movement not to encounter any problems. The key lies in whether our party organizations can follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction: "Solve problems as soon as they arise, instead of letting them pile up before making a general solution." As long as we can discover and solve problems at any time, the movement will definitely develop healthily; otherwise, it will certainly affect the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. The following two distinctly different cases from Maojiatuo Township and Dazhang Liuzhuang Village in my county illustrate this point.
    Maojiatuo Township originally had nine old cooperatives, with member households accounting for half of the total households. This year, eight new cooperatives have been established, and with the expanded number of households in the nine old cooperatives, member households now account for 88 percent of the total households. The party organization in this township has paid attention to discovering and solving problems at any time during the movement. As a result, the cooperatives in this township have been consolidated, the members' morale is stable, and the winter fertilizer accumulation campaign is in full swing.
    In the process of establishing cooperatives, Maojiatuo Township once saw the emergence of a "middle peasant cooperative" and a "poor peasant cooperative," both with seventeen households. The "middle peasant cooperative" had six wells and six waterwheels, as well as fifteen livestock. The "poor peasant cooperative" had no wells, no waterwheels, and only three weak livestock. After the township branch discovered this situation, they conducted ideological education work among the members of the "middle peasant cooperative" and the "poor peasant cooperative," explaining the party's policy of relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants, and explaining that only by uniting poor and middle peasants can cooperatives be run well. After the thinking of the members of these two cooperatives was straightened out, the two cooperatives were merged with other cooperatives. This not only overcame the abnormal phenomenon of poor and middle peasants establishing separate cooperatives, but also satisfied both the poor and middle peasants in these two cooperatives.
    After the new cooperatives were established, the party branch ranked all the new members and found that among the 318 households, 205 households voluntarily joined and were enthusiastic about running the cooperatives; they were all League members, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants. Seventy-five households voluntarily joined but lacked enthusiasm for running the cooperatives; they included poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and upper-middle peasants. Thirty-eight households joined nominally voluntarily, but were still hesitant and wavering in their thinking; they were mainly upper-middle peasants. Based on the ranking, the party branch organized party members, League members, and veteran cooperative cadres to divide up the work and take responsibility for educating the new members on the party's policies, publicizing the bright future of socialism, and also the difficulties that may be encountered in running the cooperatives and the ways to overcome them. At the same time, veteran cooperative members were organized to introduce their experience in running cooperatives and their increased production, using their own experiences to dispel some new members' doubts about whether the cooperatives could increase production. This in-depth and extensive publicity not only increased the confidence of those who were enthusiastic about running the cooperatives, but also motivated those who lacked enthusiasm and gradually stabilized those who were hesitant and wavering. For example, Zhang Junxing, an upper-middle peasant member, originally joined the cooperative only in name, not in heart. After this education, he expressed his determination to run the cooperative well.
    Next, the party branch analyzed and studied the situation of the main cadres of the newly established cooperatives. Among the 31 chairmen, vice-chairmen, and accountants of the eight new cooperatives, 11 were poor peasants and 13 were lower-middle peasants, giving poor and lower-middle peasants a leading advantage. However, there was one problem: none of these main cadres were party members, and only seven were League members. There was a total of one party member and 26 League members in the eight cooperatives, and the one party member had been ill for a long time. The branch had considered drawing some party members from the old cooperatives to the new cooperatives, but also took into account that the old cooperatives had expanded into medium-sized or even large cooperatives, and there were not many party members. Weakening the leadership would also affect the work. The branch decided to adopt the following two measures to solve the problem of the weak backbone of the new cooperatives. On the one hand, the nine branch committee members and 42 party members were assigned to help the new cooperatives solve specific problems for a long time to strengthen the leadership of the new cooperatives. On the other hand, they fully played the role of the existing League members in the new cooperatives, while starting to cultivate activists, develop party members, and identify two to three outstanding members in each new cooperative as potential party member candidates. The branch also planned to recruit 16 new party members in these new cooperatives next year. Currently, three members have met the requirements for joining the party, and the branch is preparing to discuss their admission.
    The new cooperatives experienced violations of the policy of mutual benefit and disorder in the evaluation of land, livestock, and production arrangements. The branch immediately organized nine veteran cooperative directors and 35 party members from the old cooperatives to provide specific assistance to the eight new cooperatives. The evaluation of the means of production was quickly completed, the cooperative charter was drafted, and a winter production plan was formulated, enabling the new cooperatives to begin orderly production. The fertilizer accumulation campaign was immediately launched in the cooperatives. By December 2nd, 1.2 million jin of crude fertilizer had been accumulated, immediately demonstrating the superiority of organization. Zhang Guozheng, an upper-middle peasant who originally refused to invest due to difficulties, also invested 60 yuan. Lan Shufang and Zhang Junju, upper-middle peasants who originally expressed their firm opposition to joining the cooperative, are also considering joining.
    In contrast, the party organization of Dazhang Liuzhuang Village in Liguantun Township was not like this. The village originally had two old cooperatives, with member households accounting for 22 percent of the total households. After October, two new cooperatives were established, and with the expanded number of households in the two old cooperatives, member households reached 56 percent of the total households. The newly established cooperatives had many problems and urgently needed the leadership and assistance of the party organization. However, the village branch was satisfied with the figure of 56 percent and not only did not try to discover problems, but even refused to actively solve problems that came to their door. For example, Zhao Meizhen, the director of the Fourth Cooperative, encountered difficulties in evaluating the means of production and went to Zhao Meisheng, a branch committee member, for advice. The branch committee member was impatient and said, "The cooperative has been approved, what's the hurry to evaluate the means of production!" As a result, serious violations of the policy of mutual benefit occurred in the evaluation of the means of production in both new cooperatives. The fertilizer of the middle peasants was of good quality, but it was priced the same as that of the poor peasants, which harmed the interests of the middle peasants. The land quality of the poor peasants was the same as that of the middle peasants, but it was just not well processed. With the unified management of the cooperative, it would generate greater potential, but no appropriate method of compensating for labor and fertilizer was adopted. Instead, the grade of the land of the poor peasants was lowered, which seriously harmed the interests of the poor peasants. Therefore, when launching investment, everyone had no confidence to take out money. The cooperative director went to the branch for a solution, but the branch secretary Li Shuo replied, "Don't worry, the state will help." Because the branch did not solve the problems in the cooperative, it greatly affected the consolidation of the cooperative. The labor organization of the new cooperative was not established, the production plan was not formulated, the fertilizer accumulation was not carried out at all, and the members' thinking was very chaotic. It was not until the county party committee's consolidation work team arrived in the village in early December that they helped the branch to rectify. While solving various problems in the cooperative, they also organized production. The two new cooperatives were quickly consolidated. In less than half a month, the Fourth Cooperative accumulated 280,000 jin of fertilizer and irrigated all the wheat that could be winter irrigated. The branch then realized the mistake of abandoning specific leadership and began to pay attention to continuing to consolidate the work of the cooperative.
    The facts of Maojiatuo Township and Dazhang Liuzhuang Village tell us that we must strengthen leadership over the agricultural cooperative movement and not abandon leadership. The key to strengthening leadership is to regularly check the problems in the cooperative and solve these problems in a timely manner. Otherwise, problems will definitely pile up and we will definitely fall behind the movement.

    要加强领导，不要放弃领导
    中共河北省丰润县委书记　林琦
    农业合作化运动的规模这样巨大，发展又这样迅速，我们的经验还这样少，要使运动中不发生什么问题，这是不可能的，关键在于我们的党组织是不是能够像毛泽东同志指示的：“一有问题就去解决，不要使问题成了堆才去作一次总解决。”只要能够随时发现问题，随时解决，运动一定能够健康地发展，否则，一定会影响农业合作社的巩固的。从我县毛家坨乡和大张刘庄村两个显然不同的事例中，就可以说明这一问题。
    毛家坨乡原有九个老社，入社农户占总农户的一半。今年建立了八个新社，加上九个老社扩大的户数，入社农户已占总农户的百分之八十八。这个乡的党组织在运动中随时注意发现问题并且随时加以解决，因此这个乡的合作社都得到了巩固，社员的情绪都很稳定，冬季积肥运动正在紧张进行。
    毛家坨乡在建社过程中，曾出现了一个“中农社”和一个“贫农社”，都是十七户。“中农社”有六眼水井，六架水车，还有十五头牲口。而“贫农社”没水井，也没水车，只有三头瘦弱的牲口。乡支部发现了这种情况后，就分别去对“中农社”和“贫农社”的社员进行思想教育工作，说明党的依靠贫农团结中农的政策，说明只有贫农和中农联合起来才能把社办好的道理，在打通了这两个社社员的思想以后，就把这两个社和其他社合并了。这样，既克服了贫农、中农分别建社的不正常现象，又使这两个社的贫农、中农都很满意。
    新社建立起来以后，党支部就把所有新社员排了一下队，发现在三百一十八户中，入社自愿又有办社积极性的有二百零五户，他们都是团员、贫农和下中农；入社自愿但还缺乏办社积极性的有七十五户，他们之中有贫农、下中农，也有上中农；入社表面上自愿，思想上还犹疑动摇的有三十八户，他们主要是上中农。党支部根据排队的情况，就组织了党员、团员、老社干部按社分工包干，对新社员进行党的政策的教育，既宣传社会主义的美好前途，也宣传办社中间可能遇到的困难和克服困难的办法。同时又组织老社社员介绍自己办社的经验和增产的情况，现身说法地解除有些新社社员对社能否增产的疑虑。这种深入广泛的宣传，不但使积极办社的更增加了信心，而且使缺乏办社积极性的农户积极起来，犹疑动摇的农户逐渐稳定下来。比如上中农社员张俊兴原来是人入社心还没入社，经过这番教育，他表示了坚决把社办好的决心。
    接着，党支部又把新建社的主要干部的情况分析研究了一下。八个新社的三十一名正副主任和会计中，贫农十一名，下中农十三名，贫农和下中农是占了领导优势的。但有一个问题，在这些主要干部中没有一名党员，只有七名团员。八个社总共有
  一名党员，二十六名团员，一名党员还长期患病。支部曾经打算从老社中抽一部分党员到新社来，但又考虑到老社都已扩大，变成中社甚至大社了，党员并不多，如果削弱领导力量，也会影响工作。支部就决定采取以下两个办法解决新社骨干较弱的问题，一方面由九个支部委员和四十二个党员长期分工帮助新社解决具体问题，加强对新社的领导。另一方面，充分发挥新社中现有团员的作用，同时着手培养积极分子，发展党员，并在每个新社中物色了两名到三名优秀分子作为党员的培养对象，支部还计划明年在这些新社中吸收十六名新党员，目前已有三名具备了入党条件，支部准备讨论接收。
    新社在评土地、评牲畜以及安排生产中都发生了违反互利政策和混乱的现象，支部立即组织九名老社主任和老社的三十五名党员到八个新社中进行具体帮助。很快做好了评定生产资料工作，订好了社章并制定了冬季生产计划，使新社开始了有秩序的生产。社内的积肥运动马上开展起来，到十二月二日已积粗肥一百二十万斤，立即显示了组织起来的优越性。原来借口困难不积极投资的上中农张国正，也投资六十元。原来表示坚决不入社的上中农蓝树芳、张俊举等也正酝酿入社。
    相反，李官屯乡大张刘庄村党组织却不是这样。这个村原有两个老社，入社农户占总农户百分之二十二；十月以后又建立了两个新社，加上两个老社扩大的户数，入社农户达到总户数的百分之五十六。新建起来的社问题很多，迫切需要党组织的领导和帮助；可是村支部却满足于百分之五十六的数字，不仅不去发现问题，甚至问题找上了门也不积极解决。比如第四社社主任赵美珍，在评定生产资料中碰到了困难，去找支部委员赵美生研究。这个支部委员还表示不耐烦，说：“社被批准了，评定生产资料还忙什么！”结果两个新社在评定生产资料中都发生了严重违反互利政策的现象。中农的肥料质量好，也和贫农的同样作价，这就损害了中农的利益。贫农土地质量和中农一样，只是加工不够，经过合作社的统一经营，会产生更大的潜力，但却没有采用适当补工补肥的办法处理，而是降低贫农土地的等级，这就严重损害了贫农的利益。因此，在发动投资时，大家都没信心拿出钱来。社主任去找支部设法解决，支部书记李硕却这样答复：“你们别发愁，国家会帮助的。”由于支部不去解决社里存在的问题，就大大影响了社的巩固，新社的劳动组织也没建立，生产计划也没制定，积肥根本没有进行，社员思想十分混乱。直到十二月初县委整社工作队到了这个村子，才帮助这个支部作了整顿。一边解决社里存在的各种问题，一边组织生产。很快就把两个新社巩固起来，不到半个月的时间，第四社就积肥二十八万斤，把能够进行冬灌的小麦全部浇过。支部这才认识了自己放弃具体领导的错误，开始注意继续巩固合作社的工作了。
    毛家坨乡和大张刘庄村的事实告诉我们，对农业合作化运动必须加强领导，不能放弃领导，加强领导的关键就是要经常检查合作社中的问题，并且及时解决这些问题。否则一定会使问题成堆，一定要落在运动的后面。
