    The Soviet Union's Sincere Efforts to Promote International Cooperation

    Thanks to the Soviet Union's initiative, the United Nations General Assembly finally overcame various artificial obstacles on December 14, opened the deadlock on the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations, and adopted the admission of sixteen countries, including Albania, to the United Nations. This is a matter of great significance for the United Nations Organization. It shows that the forces opposing international cooperation ultimately cannot resist the common desire and will of the vast majority of countries to expand the foundation of the United Nations.

    Anyone can see that the settlement of the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations at this session of the General Assembly is the result of the Soviet initiative and the support of many other countries. As everyone knows, the plan to admit eighteen countries, supported by the vast majority of countries, failed due to the deliberate sabotage by the Chiang Kai-shek clique at the instigation of the United States in the Security Council. The tremendous efforts of fifty-two countries on the issue of admitting new member states almost came to naught. In this situation, the Soviet Union continued to seek other ways to resolve this issue, suggesting that the Security Council recommend sixteen countries from the eighteen applicant countries, excluding the Mongolian People's Republic and Japan, to the current United Nations General Assembly to join the United Nations. The Soviet Union also believed that countries should make joint efforts between the two sessions of the General Assembly to admit these two countries, which have not received a positive recommendation, to the United Nations at the next session of the General Assembly. The Soviet proposal was praised and supported by most countries. This put the United States in a position where it could no longer sabotage, so that the United Nations General Assembly was finally able to break the deadlock on the issue of admitting new member states.

    This touching action of the Soviet Union vividly demonstrates the great mind of the Soviet Union in striving to promote international cooperation. Now people can see more clearly who is taking a stubborn attitude of obstructing and undermining the admission of new member states to the United Nations, and who sincerely hopes that more countries will enter the United Nations.

    The United Nations has greatly expanded its organization by adding sixteen new members. This is a serious blow to the United States' attempt to continue to control the United Nations. On the 14th at the United Nations General Assembly, when the sixteen countries were voted on separately, the United States still abstained on certain applicant countries, alone with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This situation can only lead to the conclusion that if the United States does not abandon its intention to monopolize and command the United Nations, then it will inevitably become increasingly isolated in this world organization.

    It must be pointed out that the fact that the United Nations General Assembly has not been able to admit all eighteen applicant countries as the vast majority of countries had hoped is not entirely satisfactory. And the reason for this result is clear to everyone. The United States' instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to veto the application of the Mongolian People's Republic clearly exposes the United States' stubborn opposition to peaceful coexistence and its hostility to international cooperation. But this cannot erase the fact that the Mongolian People's Republic exists and develops in an increasingly consolidated manner. Because of this stubborn attitude of the United States, Japan has also been unable to enter the United Nations. Japanese public opinion has criticized the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is completely reasonable.

    All peace-loving people sincerely welcome the decision of the United Nations to admit sixteen new member states and believe that the expansion of the membership of the United Nations will strengthen its role and prestige. At the same time, people have reason to expect that all countries that truly cherish the United Nations organization will continue to strive to realize the principle that membership of the United Nations should be universal, so that the Mongolian People's Republic and other countries that are still excluded from the United Nations organization can join the United Nations as soon as possible.

### 苏联促进国际合作的真诚努力

    苏联促进国际合作的真诚努力
    由于苏联的倡议，联合国大会终于在十二月十四日克服各种人为的障碍，打开了联合国接纳新会员国问题的僵局，通过接纳阿尔巴尼亚等十六个国家参加联合国。这是联合国组织的一件具有重大意义的事情。它表明了反对国际合作的势力终究抗拒不过绝大多数国家要求扩大联合国基础的共同愿望和意志。
    谁都可以看得到，联合国接纳新会员国问题所以能够在本届联合国大会中获得解决，是苏联倡议和许多其他国家支持的结果。大家知道，绝大多数国家所支持的接纳十八个国家的计划，由于美国指使蒋介石集团在安全理事会中故意破坏而告失败。五十二个国家在接纳新会员国问题上的巨大努力，几将化为乌有。在此情况下，苏联继续寻求解决这一问题的其他途径，建议安理会向本届联合国大会推荐十八个申请国中除蒙古人民共和国和日本以外的其他十六个国家，参加联合国。苏联并认为各国应当在两届大会中间作出联合的努力，以便在下届联合国大会上接纳这两个没有得到积极推荐的国家参加联合国。苏联的这个建议，获得了大多数国家的赞扬和支持。这就使得美国处于一种无法再事破坏的地位，因而联合国大会能够最后打破了在接纳新会员国问题上的僵局。
    苏联这种感人的行动，生动地表现了苏联努力促进国际合作的伟大胸怀。现在人们可以更加看得明白，究竟是谁在联合国接纳新会员国问题上采取一心阻挠和破坏的死硬态度，是谁真诚地希望有更多的国家进入联合国来。
    联合国由于增加了十六个新的成员而大大扩大了它的组织。这对于美国继续控制联合国的企图，是个严重的打击。就在十四日的联合国大会上，当对十六个国家分别进行表决时，美国还孤零零地和蒋介石集团对某些申请国表示“弃权”。这种情况只能使人得出这样的结论：美国如果不放弃垄断联合国、指挥联合国的打算，那末它在这个世界组织中必然会越来越加孤立。
    必须指出，联合国大会没有能够像绝大多数国家所希望那样接纳所有十八个申请国家，是不能令人完全满意的。而所以造成这样的结果的原因，则是大家都清楚的。美国指使蒋介石集团否决蒙古人民共和国的申请，清楚地暴露了美国顽固地反对和平共处和敌视国际合作的面目。但是这并不能抹煞蒙古人民共和国日益巩固地存在和发展的事实。由于美国的这种顽固态度，使日本也不能进入联合国。日本舆论纷纷斥责美国和蒋介石集团，这是完全合理的。
    一切爱好和平的人民都真心欢迎联合国接纳十六个新会员国的决定，并且相信联合国成员的扩大，将会加强它的作用和威信。同时人们有理由期望真正爱护联合国组织的各国，继续为实现联合国会员国应具有普遍性的原则而努力，使得蒙古人民共和国和其他至今仍被摈拒在联合国组织之外的国家能够尽早参加联合国。
