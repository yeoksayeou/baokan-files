Review of Hua Gang's "Outline of Dialectical Materialism"
    Ding Weizhi, Li Xuekun, Gao Yu
    Hua Gang's "Outline of Dialectical Materialism" was first published in the Shandong University journals "New Shand Da" and "Wen Shi Zhe," and later published as a single volume by Shanghai People's Publishing House and widely distributed. This is a book that takes advantage of the study movement to promote dialectical materialism and oppose idealism to speculate and deceive people. Some people in academic circles have already made some criticisms of this book (Gao Qinghai's "Review of Hua Gang's 'Outline of Dialectical Materialism'," published in the second issue of the Journal of Humanities of Northeast People's University in 1955; Chen Changshu's "On Two Pairs of Categories of Materialist Dialectics - Necessity and Chance, Possibility and Reality," published in "Philosophical Research" in the third issue of 1955). We believe it is necessary to further expose and criticize the despicable plagiarism methods adopted by Hua Gang in this book and the crudeness and error-ridden nature of this book.

    I. Open Plagiarism

    This "Outline of Dialectical Materialism," marked as "authored" by Hua Gang, is not without its characteristics; plagiarism is one of its greatest features. According to our preliminary verification, at least one-quarter of the book's more than 500 pages is plagiarized word-for-word, paragraph-by-paragraph, chapter-by-chapter from other people's works. This kind of plagiarism is so undisguised and unscrupulous that it seems Hua Gang simply doesn't understand that this is a criminal act of illegally occupying the fruits of other people's labor.

    Hua Gang's "Outline of Dialectical Materialism" (hereinafter referred to as "Outline") is basically written based on the 1951 textbook "Dialectical Materialism" of the Soviet Advanced Party School (published by the Chinese People's University, hereinafter referred to as "Textbook"). He stole the most from this book. In Hua Gang's "Outline," some chapters are almost entirely plagiarized from the "Textbook," such as the second section of Chapter Five, "The Class Essence of Agnosticism," and the fifth section of the same chapter, "Objective Truth, Absolute Truth, and Relative Truth" (see "Textbook," Volume 2, pages 169-177, 225-235). It can be said that there is nothing in these two sections that is Hua Gang's own creation. There are even more passages in Hua Gang's "Outline" that are excerpts from the "Textbook." There are many of this kind of plagiarism, almost every chapter has it. It is more concentrated in the following chapters, namely: Sections 2, 3, and 4 of Chapter Four; Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter Five; Section 1 of Chapter Eight; Section 2 of Chapter Nine, etc. These chapters are also mixed with Hua Gang's own "creation," but this "creation" is nothing more than making some minor annotations on the copied text or changing individual words. Let's find a passage from Hua Gang's "Outline" and the Soviet Advanced Party School textbook to compare:

    "Sensation and perception, as Lenin said, are the real and direct connection between consciousness and the outside world. They only arise when the senses feel the stimulation of this or that object from the outside world and disappear when the possibility of the object acting on our senses disappears. However, if there can be no sensation and perception without the direct action of objects on human senses, then there can be ideas without directly perceiving objects. Ideas are produced on the basis of the past perception of objects (this object still retains its image in people's memory). For example, people who have seen the Column Hall of the Trade Union Building and the spires of the Moscow Kremlin can reproduce their images when they do not directly perceive them." ("Textbook," Volume 2, page 196)

    "Sensation and perception are the direct connection between sensory organs and external objects (this sentence was copied incorrectly because Hua Gang did not understand or deliberately distorted Lenin's words - quoted by the author). They only arise when the senses feel the stimulation of this or that object from the outside world and will disappear when the possibility of the object acting on our senses disappears. However, if there can be no sensation and perception without the direct action of objects on human senses, then there can be representation without directly perceiving objects, because objects that have been felt and perceived by people in the past can retain their image in people's memory. In this way, representation can be produced on the basis of past sensation and perception. For example, people who have seen Tiananmen Square and Zhongnanhai can also reproduce their images when they do not directly perceive them." ("Outline," page 194. All quotations from the "Outline" below will only indicate the page number.)

    Anyone can see that the latter passage is a replica of the former passage, and is almost identical in wording. The biggest difference is that Hua Gang replaced "the Column Hall of the Trade Union Building and the spires of the Moscow Kremlin" with "Tiananmen Square and Zhongnanhai."

    In addition to plagiarizing the textbooks of the Soviet Advanced Party School, Hua Gang also plagiarized the philosophy lectures of the Chinese People's University and the philosophical papers of philosophers at home and abroad. For example, Hua Gang copied a paper written by the Soviet philosopher Kedrov, "On the Leap Forms in the Development of Nature and Society" (see Miting et al., "Collection of Essays on Marxist-Leninist Philosophy Issues"), into his own book, pretending to be his own "creation," and turned it into the third section of Chapter Nine of his book, "Two Leap Forms in the Development of Nature and Society." For another example, the first six sections of Chapter Eleven of Hua Gang's book, "Dialectics and Formal Logic," largely plagiarized Comrade Mate's paper "On the Preliminary Laws of Logical Thinking." Poor Comrade Mate's booklet, which totaled fifty-seven pages, was almost entirely dissected piece by piece and transformed into Hua Gang's "work." (In Chapter Eleven of Hua Gang's book, there is also a large amount of plagiarism from other works, such as Strogovich's "Logic.")

    Hua Gang even plagiarized the classic works of Marxism. In many places, he copied paragraphs of the original text of the classic writers without indicating the source or adding quotation marks, and mixed it with his own words. For example, Hua Gang's "Outline" copied a large amount of Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" in the sixth section of Chapter Five and Chapter Ten. Only a few places used quotation marks to indicate the source, but more places mixed Chairman Mao's words with his own words without any annotation. Thus, he blatantly attributed the original text of the classic writers to his own name.

    II. Theoretical Confusion and Errors

    In Hua Gang's book, in addition to a large amount of direct, word-for-word plagiarism, there are also many places where the plagiarism is disguised, resulting in many seemingly right but actually wrong and logically confused statements. Interspersed in such a large amount of plagiarism is also Hua Gang's genuine "creation." This "creation" contradicts Hua Gang's directly copied words due to its characteristics of violating the fundamental principles of Marxism. Therefore, if we think that what we have encountered is just an "honest plagiarist" who does not know that plagiarism is a criminal act, then we have underestimated the author of this "Outline." In fact, this "Outline" is playing a role in undermining the scientific nature of Marxism and destroying Marxist theory under the guise of copying Marxism.

    What unique "creations" does Hua Gang's "Outline" have? Because there are too many problems, we can only talk about the main ones here.

    On the Basic Question of Philosophy

    The basic question of philosophy, the relationship between thinking and being, is the only scientific criterion for distinguishing materialism from idealism. Correctly elucidating the basic question of philosophy is of key significance for elucidating other philosophical questions. However, Hua Gang's discussion of such an important issue in his "Outline" constantly falls into confusion.

    In the section "The Fundamental Question of Philosophy and the Basis for Its Division into Two Major Camps," Hua Gang begins by saying: "Idealist philosophers believe that philosophy is inherently abstract. Therefore, the fundamental question of philosophy is to study and solve the problem of how spirit, consciousness, or reason arises and what role it plays..." (page 47) And he says: "The reason why idealists have this idea is because they believe that the origin of the universe or the world is spirit and consciousness, and everything else is derived from spirit and consciousness." Here, Hua Gang regards the problem of studying how consciousness arises and what role it plays as a characteristic of idealism. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. In fact, both materialist philosophy and idealist philosophy have to deal with the problem of how consciousness arises and what role it plays, and only materialism has made a scientific answer to this problem. Therefore, whether or not one attaches importance to the study of this issue is by no means the boundary between distinguishing materialism and idealism; their boundary lies in how they handle and answer this question. Idealists cannot correctly handle and solve this problem because they proceed from the point of view that spirit determines matter. According to Hua Gang, only idealists attach importance to studying the problem of how consciousness arises and what role it plays, as if materialists do not need to study and solve this problem. Hua Gang's statement not only fails to draw a clear line between materialism and idealism, but on the contrary, confuses this boundary.

    Immediately afterwards, Hua Gang said: "Starting from such a standpoint, since idealists cannot see anything other than spirit and consciousness, and only spirit and consciousness can dominate everything, they naturally regard the history of philosophy only as the history of explaining how fundamental human thoughts and their systems arise and develop, that is, only as the history of the advancement, rise, and development of human knowledge of the surrounding universe." (page 47) This is also confusing. Why does starting from an idealist standpoint "naturally" regard the history of philosophy as "the history of the advancement, rise, and development of human knowledge of the surrounding universe"? What is the idealist error of this view? Originally, the sentence "the history of philosophy is the history of the advancement, rise, and development of human knowledge of the surrounding universe" is a definition of the object of study of the history of philosophy in the book "History of Western European Philosophy" written by Alexandrov, who was criticized by Zhdanov. This definition is wrong, but when Zhdanov criticized its error, he did not say that this definition was derived from an idealist point of view, but said that this definition equated the object of study of the history of philosophy with the object of study of general science history. Please see what common ground is there between this and Hua Gang's interpretation of this definition? It can be seen that Hua Gang himself simply did not understand the difference between materialism and idealism, so he arbitrarily interpreted it in this way.

    From the above examples, it can be seen that Hua Gang did not intend to seriously argue the basic question of philosophy. He only copied and plagiarized statements from various textbooks on the one hand, and expressed his opinions according to his own ideas on the other hand. From the words Hua Gang himself said, it can be shown that he actually does not understand the basic question of philosophy, nor does he understand the fundamental difference between materialism and idealism. We can also cite other proofs.

    In the chapter "The Primacy of Matter and the Secondariness of Consciousness," Hua Gang wrote: "The primacy of matter and the secondariness of consciousness are the second basic characteristics of dialectical materialism. In this basic characteristic, we can see three important meanings, namely: (1) Matter is the origin of the universe;... (2) Consciousness is the advanced product of matter... (3) Matter precedes consciousness..." These are words that can be copied from any philosophy lecture notes, but Hua Gang made the conclusion from this: "According to these three basic points, we can more strictly distinguish dialectical materialism from idealism, mechanical materialism, and dualism." (page 129) Anyone with a little philosophical common sense knows that the principle of the primacy of matter and the secondariness of consciousness can only distinguish materialism from idealism, but cannot distinguish dialectical materialism from mechanical materialism. The reason is very simple, because mechanical materialism also acknowledges the principle of the primacy of matter and the secondariness of consciousness. On this point, it is consistent with dialectical materialism. If you think that you can "more strictly distinguish" dialectical materialism from mechanical materialism according to this principle, then you do not understand what mechanical materialism is, nor do you understand the difference between materialism and idealism.

    This erroneous view of Hua Gang runs through the entire chapter "The Primacy of Matter and the Secondariness of Consciousness." In another place, Hua Gang wrote: "...Dialectical materialism affirms the primacy of matter and the secondariness of consciousness, and can overcome the above-mentioned defects of mechanical materialism..." (page 132) This sentence is of course also wrong. Affirming the primacy of matter and the secondariness of consciousness is of no help in overcoming the defects of mechanical materialism. In fact, dialectical materialism overcomes the defects of mechanical materialism because it combines dialectics with materialism.

    At this point, people cannot help but wonder why Hua Gang repeatedly uses the basic question of philosophy, the primacy of matter and the secondariness of consciousness, as the criterion for distinguishing dialectical materialism from mechanical materialism? It turns out that in Hua Gang's book, many places violate the instructions of the classic writers and secretly include the question of the reaction of consciousness to matter into the basic question of philosophy that distinguishes materialism from idealism.

    Elucidating the reaction of consciousness to matter and the subjective dynamic role is one of the important tasks of dialectical materialists, but we must first draw a clear line between materialism and idealism on the fundamental question of the relationship between thinking and being, and then we can raise the question of the reaction of consciousness to matter. Mechanical materialism does not understand the reaction of consciousness, which is its major defect; but it acknowledges the principle of the primacy of matter and the secondariness of consciousness, and that consciousness is a reflection of matter. Therefore, its answer to the basic question of philosophy is materialistic, and therefore correct. Therefore, Hua Gang brought the question of whether or not to acknowledge the reaction of consciousness to the basic question of philosophy, nihilistically denying the correctness of mechanical materialism's answer to the basic question of philosophy, and comparing it with idealism. This inevitably confuses the clear boundary between materialism and idealism.

    Hua Gang also regards the movement of thinking as one of the forms of material movement from the vulgar materialist point of view (page 109), and says that consciousness is the highest form of material movement (page 330). What is the movement of thinking as one of the forms of material movement? Hua Gang cites examples, saying that the transformation from primitive dialectics to mechanical materialism and idealist dialectics, and then to dialectical materialism; the transformation in literary and artistic trends from classicism, symbolism, and naturalism to critical realism, and then to socialist realism, are all forms of the movement of thinking. This statement is completely wrong. In order to argue his point of view, Hua Gang quoted Engels in "Dialectics of Nature": "Motion is the mode of existence of matter. Matter in motion is not only coarse mechanical motion, mere change of position, but also heat and light, electric and magnetic stress, chemical combination and dissociation, life and, finally, consciousness." But Hua Gang obviously does not understand or deliberately distorts the meaning of Engels's passage. Consciousness is the product of the movement of the highest-level matter—the cerebral cortex. The movement of the cerebral cortex is the basis of thinking, and consciousness cannot exist without material movement. Engels said in the above passage: "The movement of matter... finally, consciousness" refers to this meaning. But consciousness is a reflection of the objective material world, and it is not the same thing as the objectively existing matter. Therefore, we must never think that consciousness is a form of material movement, and we must never regard philosophical thought, scientific thought, and literary and artistic thought as forms of material movement. Therefore, Engels also said in "Dialectics of Nature": "Someday we will definitely be able to use experimental methods to 'reduce' thinking to molecular and chemical movements in the brain; but does this include all the essence of thinking?" This is precisely to say that regarding thinking as a form of material movement cannot show the entire essence of thinking.

    Hua Gang's erroneous statement actually negates the distinction between human ideology and nature and society that are independent of human consciousness, and will inevitably lead to the vulgar materialist view of regarding social ideology as an objective entity existing outside of people's minds. This view makes the opposition between materialism and idealism in epistemology meaningless, and also makes it impossible for us to determine what is materialism and what is idealism. Therefore, as Lenin said: "Whether thought or matter is 'real,' that is, existing—this is correct. But to call thought matter—this is an erroneous step towards confusing materialism and idealism."

    On the Question of the Evaluation of the Historical Role of Idealism and Materialism

    Hua Gang said: "Idealism has also had its positive aspects in historical development" (page 54), and also found two examples to prove that his statement is correct: First, the philosophies of Descartes and Hegel have both had a positive role (see pages 54-55). Second, "In history, there have also been immature classes expressing their reform demands in idealist terms. For example, some utopian socialists and peasant uprisings in Germany and China in the past were all tinged with religion." (page 55)

    Hua Gang's "theory of the merits of idealism" is completely wrong. Philosophical idealism has always been reactionary, a force against science and democracy. Although in history, individual idealists have played a progressive role, this does not mean that idealist philosophy itself has played a progressive role. The reason why individual idealists can play a progressive role is because some of their words and actions reflect the interests and demands of the progressive classes in society at that time, not because they have an idealist worldview or believe in religion. Everyone knows that the positive factor in the philosophy of the idealist Hegel is the rational core in his dialectics; as for his idealist theory, it is precisely playing a reactionary and anti-scientific role. Descartes is a dualist philosopher. On the one hand, he does have the idealist view of "I think, therefore I am," but at the same time, he developed materialism in physics and promoted the development of science and philosophy with his materialist view of nature. What plays a positive role in Descartes' philosophy is not idealism, but materialism. It also happens that the revolutionary masses still hold an idealist worldview. The insurgent peasants or the immature proletariat once used "idealist language" and "were tinged with religion," but does this mean that idealism is meritorious to the peasant uprising or the proletarian revolution? Obviously not. What plays an active role in the revolution is the revolutionary class and its revolutionary demands themselves, but not the "idealist language" and "religious colors" that they inevitably use or carry under certain conditions; in fact, this "idealist language" and "religious colors" often hinder the thoroughness of their revolutionary movements.

    On the one hand, Hua Gang believes that idealism has merits, but on the other hand, he is accusing materialism in the name of opposing mechanical materialism. As mentioned earlier, Hua Gang takes a sweeping attitude towards historical mechanical materialism. In addition, Hua Gang forcibly counts the views of vulgar materialism as the guilt of mechanical materialism, saying that "mechanical materialists equate consciousness with matter and cannot see any difference between the two." (page 132)

    Mechanical materialism is a historical stage in the development of materialism. Before the emergence of Marxism, it once played a progressive role in history. Of course, the entire theory of mechanical materialism has major defects and errors, but its answer to the basic question of philosophy is clear. It does not equate consciousness with matter like vulgar materialism. Today, whoever wants to promote mechanical materialism to oppose dialectical materialism is of course completely reactionary and anti-scientific; but it is equally reactionary and anti-scientific to manufacture some unwarranted charges for mechanical materialism like Hua Gang, deny the historical role of materialism before Marxism, and use it to accompany his "theory of the merits of idealism."

    On the Negation of Negation

    Hua Gang is extremely dissatisfied with Engels's proposition of the negation of negation as a basic law of dialectics. He shouts:

    "However, in any case, the formula of 'negation of negation' itself has the nature of equilibrium or circularity. In fact, not all development passes through the form of 'affirmation, negation, negation of negation.' Therefore, 'negation of negation' is by no means a universal law." (page 250)

    This is openly rebuking Engels. This is saying: "However, in any case," you Engels are always wrong to use this formula! And Hua Gang also maliciously raised the banner of Stalin to oppose Engels and oppose dialectics. In fact, this is distorting Engels on the one hand, and distorting Stalin on the other.

    Marx and Engels both believed that the negation of negation is one of the basic laws of dialectics. Marx and Engels made a fundamental materialist interpretation of the content of the law of negation of negation that was different from Hegel's. In short, the main content of the law of negation of negation argued by Marx and Engels is: Motion is a process of progress, ascent, from simple to complex, from low to high. New things are produced on the basis of old things and absorb everything reasonable in old things. In the process of advancing development, there is a characteristic of inheritance between the new and the old, and between the low and the high. Development is spiral, not cyclical. Development is a relative repetition of past things at a new and higher stage. Are these contents objective and universal laws? Of course. The dialectical law of negation of negation mentioned by classic dialectical materialist writers does not mean any other mysterious truth. Hua Gang first distorted Engels's law of negation of negation into Hegel's mysterious syllogism, and then attacked the law of negation of negation itself and attacked Engels. This is a common trick used by many enemies of Marxism throughout history.

    Although Stalin did not use the name negation of negation when expressing the characteristics of dialectics, he not only never denied the content of the law of negation of negation, but also expressed it in the characteristic of the transformation of quantity into quality. Hua Gang insisted that Stalin was against the law itself, which is obviously distorting Stalin's original meaning.

    Hua Gang is using Stalin, who has been distorted by his hands, to oppose Engels, who has also been distorted by his hands. In fact, there is no principled disagreement between Engels and Stalin; what has a principled disagreement with the correct opinions of Engels and Stalin is Hua Gang's anti-dialectical point of view.

    On the Categories of Dialectics

    Hua Gang also wrote the categories of dialectics in a mess. For some important categories, such as form and content, he did not mention them at all; for some categories, such as causality, necessity and contingency, essence and phenomenon, etc., he wrote them extremely confusedly and inaccurately; for some categories, such as essential connection and non-essential connection, possibility and reality, etc., he made some extremely obvious distortions. Comrade Chen Changshu and Comrade Gao Qinghai have pointed out the errors in this regard in their articles. Here we also want to talk about Hua Gang's erroneous views on the two pairs of categories of essential connection and non-essential connection, and possibility and reality.

    Hua Gang used vague reasoning instead of the task of giving a clear definition to essential connection and non-essential connection, and used a large number of meaningless and irrelevant examples instead of a theoretical exposition of this pair of categories.

    When Hua Gang explained what essential connection is, he cited examples saying that the connection between dialectics and materialism, and the connection between the Soviet Union and China are essential connections; at the same time, according to him, all essential connections should be reduced to "the internal contradiction of things" (page 281). Connecting Hua Gang's two statements, we will naturally get an absurd conclusion: the relationship between dialectics and materialism, and the relationship between the Soviet Union and China are all manifestations of the internal contradiction of things.

    Because Hua Gang vulgarly and simply explained the internal connection and external connection, and used this to explain the essential connection and non-essential connection, he concluded that the mutual relations between countries in the socialist camp are essential connections, while their connections with imperialist countries are non-essential connections. This meaningless inference is the result of simplifying the complex and diverse connections between things. In fact, a thing not only has the distinction between essential connection and non-essential connection in its different connections with various things; but also, just looking at the connection between two things, there must be diverse connections, among which there are essential and non-essential. For example, between the countries in the socialist camp and the imperialist countries, there are not only non-essential connections, but also essential connections. The existence and development of the powerful socialist camp will inevitably promote the contradictions and crises within the imperialist system. This is an essential connection.

    Dialectical materialism points out that the so-called essential connection refers to some of the main, decisive, internal, and organic connections that exist in the intricate connections of things. The so-called non-essential connection refers to some secondary, superficial, and non-decisive connections. To be good at distinguishing between essential connection and non-essential connection is to be able to discover the fundamental causes of the development of things and its regularity, and to find the fundamental methods to solve problems in practice. However, Hua Gang's discussion not only did not clarify what is essential connection and what is non-essential connection, but also confused the nature of the two connections.

    When Hua Gang talked about the pair of categories of possibility and reality, he gave an incorrect definition of possibility. He said: "In philosophy, if the conditions for the existence of a certain thing are already met, but it cannot be said that its realization is inevitable, it is called possibility" (page 344). This statement is wrong, because not all possibilities and inevitabilities are incompatible. Some phenomena that can "be said that their realization is inevitable," that is, phenomena that are in line with the laws of development of things and will definitely be realized, are still possibilities before they are realized. For example, our country has the possibility of building socialism. This does not mean that it "cannot be said" that socialism will inevitably be realized in our country. It can be seen that although not all possibilities have the inevitability of their realization, the possibility that conforms to inevitability does exist. Precisely because of this, the process of development in accordance with the law is also a process of turning possibility into reality. In this process, the role of subjective initiative is still huge. If Hua Gang does not admit that unrealized inevitability is also possibility, it will make us ignore the subjective dynamic role, passively wait for the realization of inevitability, and fall into the quagmire of fatalism.

    In another place, Hua Gang expressed another fallacy from another angle. As a result, he will also achieve the same goal of negating people's dynamic role in the process of transforming possibility into reality. He said: "The internal contradiction of things makes the development of things have multiple possibilities, but under certain conditions, time, and place, only one of them is a real possibility" (page 351). This is completely wrong. Precisely because "the internal contradiction of things makes the development of things have multiple possibilities," so under any "conditions, time, and place," the development of any thing will have at least two real possibilities, namely, the possibility of the development of new and advanced things, and the possibility of the temporary preservation of the old things that are opposed to this and the temporary victory of the reactionary and backward things—although the latter possibility is not necessarily a possibility that must be realized. —There will be no situation where a real possibility exists alone. It is precisely because of this that subjective initiative has great significance in the activity of striving for one real possibility to become reality and excluding another real possibility to become reality. For example, in our country, in the process of striving for the real possibility of the success of socialist construction to become reality, and preventing and excluding the real possibility of the restoration of imperialist forces and feudal forces to become reality, the activities of the Communist Party, the people's government, and the people of the whole country play a decisive role. It can be seen that Hua Gang's erroneous views will hinder people from giving play to the role of subjective initiative in practice. This is a very harmful viewpoint for the revolutionary cause and scientific development.

    It should be pointed out that most of the section on possibility and reality in Hua Gang's book is copied from an article by a young author (ie Zhang Shihong's "On Possibility and Reality and the Way Possibility is Transformed into Reality," see "Wen Shi Zhe" No. 3, 1954), but the above-mentioned errors are all Hua Gang's own "creation."

    Chaotic Terms and Errors Against Common Sense

    In Hua Gang's "Outline," there are countless chaotic terms and errors against common sense. We will only select a few examples to display here:

    Ignoring the common sense that the proletariat and the bourgeoisie were produced at the same time, he insisted that the bourgeoisie came first, and then the proletariat (page 19); ignoring the common sense that movement and matter have no "beginning" and no "end," he said that "law is always consistent with moving matter" (page 290); ignoring the common sense that time passes and can never come back, which even seven- or eight-year-old children can understand, he insisted that time, like the process of development of things, is a process of "sometimes left, sometimes right, sometimes forward, sometimes backward," and is a "spiral rather than a linear process" that can "retreat" (pages 116-117); ignoring the principle that the law of value only does not play a regulatory role in the field of production under the socialist system, and still plays a regulatory role in the field of consumption, he forcibly changed Stalin's phrase "...the law of value does not have a regulatory role in our socialist production..." into "the law of value cannot play a regulatory role under the socialist system" (page 347); with his "heaven-shaking magic hand," he wrote the dialectician Hegel as a metaphysician (page 335), said that the subjective idealist school of Machism is dualism (page 52), and said that Berkeley, the eighteenth-century British philosopher of the big bourgeoisie, is the representative of "neo-Platonist solipsism" that "reflects the needs of medieval feudal lords" (page 67); he even created absurd terms such as "the system of bourgeois individual peasants" (page 260).

    III. Vulgar and Absurd Connection with Reality

    From a formal point of view, Hua Gang's "Outline" seems to pay quite a lot of attention to connecting with reality, and intentionally exaggerates this point in the preface. However, first, the few sections in the "Outline" that specifically talk about practical significance are extremely generalized. They are not only empty and abstract, but also obtained by means of plagiarism. Second, Hua Gang completely ignores the experience of our party's rectification campaign in the whole book, and does not specifically explain the relationship between dialectical materialism and our actual work, especially he almost completely does not mention the issue of using dialectical materialism to transform thought. Third, it is particularly intolerable what examples Hua Gang gave when making "connections with reality." The following are some samples of Hua Gang's so-called "connections with reality."

    The first type: purely literal connection. For example, on page 88, Hua Gang wrote:

    "Voluntarism is a variant of idealism, a reflection of idealism in science, and is combined with the most reactionary activism. Just like American imperialism, it believes that as long as it has the ability and the atomic bomb, it can risk carrying out its various barbaric actions."

    Naturally, voluntarism is reactionary, anti-scientific, and a school of idealism. It attempts to prove that "matter is eliminated" and only "ability" is preserved. But what direct connection does it have with the activism of American imperialism that relies on "ability"? If there is, it should be clearly pointed out; Hua Gang did not do this. He only believes that voluntarism talks about the word "ability," and activism also talks about the word "ability," so they are "combined." This is the first sample of a purely literal connection.

    Another example, on page 95, he wrote:

    "The idea of the materiality and unity of the universe is a guide for Marxist-Leninist parties to correctly understand the world and transform the world in practice. The communist worldview... embodies the organic unity of... dialectical method and... materialist theory in itself.... Recognizing and mastering this scientific worldview of unity... has great practical significance.... Without the unity of the working class, without the unity of the revolutionary party, there would be no revolutionary victory and the liberation of the working class."

    This is how to explain the practical significance of the principle of the materiality and unity of the universe. It can be said to be pure nonsense. Hua Gang only saw the two words "unity," so he went from the "unity" of the material world to the "unity" of dialectics and materialism, and then to the importance of the "unity" of the party and the revolutionary ranks. We know that the fundamental content of the unity of the world refers to: the objective world is the moving matter, and consciousness is the product of matter. Therefore, the world does not have two unrelated entities—matter and consciousness. The unity of the world lies in its materiality. These are all materialist principles. Then, may I ask Hua Gang, if someone undermines the unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks, is it a manifestation of consciousness "seeking independence" from matter? This is the second sample of a purely literal connection.

    This kind of trick of "connecting with reality" only proves that Hua Gang originally did not understand or intentionally blurred the essence of issues such as voluntarism, activism, the unity of dialectics and materialism, and the unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks.

    The second type: confusing different principles. Originally talking about this principle, but when connecting with reality, a completely different principle is used, resulting in some irrelevant conclusions. For example, when he talks about space and time being the forms of material existence and the materiality of space and time, he suddenly talks a lot about the importance of space and time, as if someone had denied the common sense that a certain space and time is needed for doing anything, so he came to uphold justice. Here, he also specially cited two examples to arm himself. One example is that the reason why China's War of Resistance Against Japan and the Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War were able to win is because both China and the Soviet Union had the "space" of a big country, and both were in the "time" of the 1930s, plus other conditions, so they won. The other example is: We also need a certain "space" (schools, classrooms, laboratories, internship places, etc.) and a certain "time" (six years of elementary school, six years of middle school, and four years of university) to cultivate construction talents (see pages 111-113).

    Hua Gang probably doesn't understand himself. He has said a bunch of nonsense about the importance of space and time here. What problem is he trying to solve? It turns out that in the former example, he replaced the principle that space and time are the forms of material existence with the principle that everything shifts with time, place, and conditions. Hua Gang used sophistry to replace one principle with another, resulting in two important principles losing their brilliance and value. Naturally, there is no question of solving practical problems.

    The third type: arbitrarily narrowing the scope of the struggle between materialism and idealism. On page 88, Hua Gang wrote:

    "...Cosmopolitanism is the most reactionary and most despicable development of idealism, and internationalism is the highest and most thorough expression of materialism. The struggle between internationalism and cosmopolitanism, and the smashing and elimination of the influence of cosmopolitanism in the ideological field... is the main task on the philosophical front at present."

    This is intentionally narrowing the scope of the struggle between two ideological systems and two philosophies. Of course, the struggle between internationalism and cosmopolitanism is an important aspect of the struggle between the socialist ideological system and the capitalist ideological system, and between dialectical materialism and idealism. But it cannot be said that this is the entire content of the struggle between the two major ideological systems or the "main" and "highest" task. We cannot explain the entire or "main" content of the struggle between us and the reactionary thought represented by Hu Shi, Hu Feng, and Liang Shuming in recent years simply with the struggle between internationalism and cosmopolitanism. We must launch a comprehensive criticism of the reactionary worldview of idealism from all aspects, especially from epistemology.

    Whether or not the practical problems raised in the revolutionary process can be solved is the touchstone for distinguishing true and false Marxists. On the issue of connecting with reality, dogmatists who do not understand Marxism and fake Marxists who deliberately oppose Marxism will inevitably expose their true colors. Hua Gang's absurdity in connecting with reality exposes his complete ignorance of dialectical materialism.

    In short, Hua Gang's "Outline of Dialectical Materialism" is a bad book full of plagiarism and absurd arguments.

    评华岗的“辩证唯物论大纲”
    丁伟志　李学昆　高禹
    华岗的“辩证唯物论大纲”一书，首先在山东大学校刊“新山大”和“文史哲”杂志上发表过，以后又由上海人民出版社印成单行本，并大量发行。这是一本利用宣传辩证唯物主义反对唯心主义的学习运动而投机骗人的书。学术界已经有人对这本书提出了一些批评（高清海作“评华岗的‘辩证唯物论大纲’”，刊于东北人民大学人文科学学报一九五五年第二期。陈昌曙作“关于唯物辩证法的两对范畴——必然性与偶然性、可能性与现实性”，刊于“哲学研究”一九五五年第三期），我们认为有必要进一步揭露和批判华岗在这本书中所采取的卑鄙的剽窃手段和这本书中的粗制滥造、错误百出的情况。
      一、公开的剽窃
    这部标明华岗“著”的“辩证唯物论大纲”不是没有特色的，剽窃是它最大的特点之一。根据我们初步核对的结果，全书五百多页的篇幅至少有四分之一是逐字逐句、成段成章地从别人的作品中剽窃下来的。这种剽窃是如此不加掩饰、毫无顾忌，看来华岗好像根本不懂得这是一种非法占有他人劳动果实的犯罪行为。
    华岗“著”的“辩证唯物论大纲”（以下简称“大纲”），基本上是依据苏联高级党校一九五一年教材“辩证唯物论”（中国人民大学出版，以下简称“教材”）一书写成的，他从这本书中偷来的东西最多。在华岗的“大纲”中，有些章节几乎是一字不易地从“教材”中剽窃下来的，第五章第二节“不可知论的阶级本质”和同章的第五节“客观真理、绝对真理和相对真理”就是两个典型的例子（参看“教材”下册一六九—一七七页、二二五—二三五页）。这两节中可以说没有一点是华岗自己的创作。在华岗的“大纲”中还有更多的篇幅是从“教材”中节录下来的。属于这一种剽窃的数量很多，差不多每一章都有。比较集中地存在于以下一些章节中，即：第四章的二、三、四节；第五章的三、四节；第八章的第一节；第九章的第二节等等。在这些章节中也掺杂有华岗自己的“创作”，但是这种“创作”无非是对抄袭来的文字作些许注释，或者是更换个别字眼而已。让我们从华岗的“大纲”和苏联高级党校教材中各找出一段来对照一下：
    “感觉和知觉，如列宁所说的，是意识与外界的真正直接的联系。它们只在感官感受外界这种或那种对象的刺激时产生，在对象作用于我们感官的可能性消灭时消失。然而，如果说没有对象直接作用于人的感官就不可能有感觉和知觉的话，那末，虽然不直接地知觉对象，却可能有观念。观念是在对象（这一对象在人底记忆中尚保存着它的形象）的过去的知觉的基础上产生的。例如，看见过工会大厦的圆柱大厅和莫斯科克里姆林宫的尖塔的人，当他不直接感知它们的时候，可以再现出它们的形象。”（“教材”下册一九六页）
    “感觉和知觉是感觉器官和外界对象的直接联系（这句话是因为华岗不懂得或者有意歪曲列宁的话而抄走了样——引者），它们只在感官感受外界这种或那种对象的刺激时产生出来，一到对象作用于我们感官的可能性消灭时就会消失。可是，如果说没有对象直接作用于人的感官，就不可能有感觉和知觉的话；那末，虽然不直接地知觉对象，却可能有表象，因为过去被人感觉和知觉过的对象，可以在人的记忆中保存着它的形象，这样，表象就可以在过去的感觉和知觉基础上产生。例如曾经看见过天安门和中南海的人，当他不直接感知它们的时候，也可以复现出它们的形象。”（“大纲”一九四页。以下凡引自“大纲”的引文，都只注明页数。）
    任何人都可以看出后面一段是前面一段的翻版，在字句上几乎是完全相同的。最大的区别就是华岗用“天安门和中南海”来代替了“工会大厦的圆柱大厅和莫斯科克里姆林宫的尖塔”。
    华岗除了剽窃苏联高级党校的教材外，还剽窃了中国人民大学的哲学讲义，剽窃了国内外哲学家们的哲学论文。例如，华岗把苏联哲学家凯德洛夫所写的一篇论文“论自然界与社会发展中的飞跃形式”
  （见米丁等著：“马克思列宁主义哲学问题论文集”），转抄到自己书里，冒充自己的“创作”，变成了他的书中的第九章第三节“自然界和社会发展中的两种飞跃形式”。又例如，华岗的书中的第十一章“辩证法和形式逻辑”的前六节大量地抄袭了马特同志的论文“论逻辑思维的初步规律”。可怜马特同志的这本一共五十七页的小册子几乎全部都被一段一段地支解开来，化成了华岗的“著作”。
  （在华岗的第十一章内还从其他著作作了大量的剽窃，如斯特罗果维契的“逻辑”。）
    华岗还竟然剽窃了马克思主义的经典著作。他在很多地方成段地抄录了经典作家的原文，不注明出处，也不加引号，把它夹杂在自己的话中间。例如，华岗的“大纲”第五章第六节和第十章大量地抄录了毛主席的“实践论”和“矛盾论”，其中只有少数地方用了引号，指明了出处，但是更多的地方却是毫无注释地把毛主席的话和自己的话混杂在一起，于是，明目张胆地把经典作家的原文也归于自己的名下了。
      二、理论上的混乱和错误
    在华岗的书中，除了大量地直接地逐字逐句地剽窃以外，还有许多地方是改头换面地抄袭，因而出现了许多似是而非，逻辑混乱的话。夹杂在这样大量剽窃中的也有华岗的真正“创作”，这种“创作”以其违反马克思主义根本原理的特征而同华岗所直接抄袭来的话互相矛盾。因此，如果以为我们所遇到的不过是一个不知抄袭为犯罪行为的“老实的文抄公”，那还是过低估计了这本“大纲”的作者。这本“大纲”事实上是在抄袭马克思主义的形式下起着损害马克思主义的科学性，破坏马克思主义的理论的作用。
    华岗的“大纲”究竟有什么独出心裁的“创作”呢？因为问题太多，这里只好拣主要的谈谈。
      关于哲学基本问题
    思维对存在的关系这一哲学的基本问题，是区别唯物主义和唯心主义的唯一科学的标准。正确地阐明哲学基本问题，对于阐明哲学上的其他问题有着关键性的意义。但是，华岗在他的“大纲”中对这样一个重要的问题的论述，不断地陷入了混乱。
    在“哲学的根本问题及其所以分为两大阵营的根据”一节中，华岗一开头就说：“唯心论的哲学家，认为哲学本来就是抽象的东西，因此，哲学的根本问题，就是研究和解决精神、意识或理性究竟如何发生以及究竟有何作用的问题……”（四七页）并且说：“唯心论者所以会有这种想法，乃是因为他们认定宇宙或世界的本原就是精神和意识，其他一切都是精神和意识的派生物”。这里华岗是把研究意识如何发生以及有何作用的问题当成唯心主义的特征。这是完全不符合事实的。事实上，唯物主义哲学和唯心主义哲学都要处理意识如何发生以及有何作用的问题，并且只有唯物主义才对这个问题作了科学的解答。因此，是否重视这一问题的研究绝不是区分唯物主义和唯心主义的界限，它们的界限是在怎样处理和解答这个问题上面。唯心主义者因为从精神决定物质的观点出发，所以不能正确地处理和解决这个问题。而照华岗说起来，只有唯心主义者才重视研究意识如何发生以及有何作用的问题，好像唯物主义者并不要研究和解决这个问题。华岗的这种说法不但没有划清唯物主义和唯心主义的界限，相反，倒是混淆了这个界限。
    紧接着，华岗又说：“唯心论者从这样的立场出发，既然看不见精神和意识以外的东西，只有精神和意识可以支配一切，当然也就把哲学史只看成是说明人类根本思想及其体系如何发生和发展的历史，也就是只看成是人类对于周围宇宙的知识之前进、上升和发展的历史。”（四七页）这也是使人糊涂的话，为什么从唯心主义的立场出发，就“当然”把哲学史看成是“人类对于周围宇宙的知识之前进、上升和发展的历史”？这种看法的唯心主义错误表现在什么地方呢？原来哲学史是“人类对于周围宇宙的知识之前进、上升和发展的历史”这句话是曾受到日丹诺夫批评的亚历山大洛夫所著“西欧哲学史”一书中为哲学史的研究对象所下的定义；这个定义是错误的，但是日丹诺夫在批评它的错误的时候，并没有说这个定义是从唯心主义观点中引申出来的，而是说这个定义把哲学史研究的对象和一般科学史研究的对象等同起来了。请看这和华岗对这个定义所作的解释究竟有何共同之处呢？可见华岗自己根本没有搞清楚唯物主义和唯心主义的区别，因此才这样任意地解释。
    从上述的例子中可以看出，华岗并没有打算认真地去论证哲学基本问题，他只是一方面套用和抄袭了各种教科书上的语句，一方面按自己的意思发表议论。从华岗自己说的这些话中可以表明他实际上并不懂得哲学基本问题，也不懂得唯物主义和唯心主义的根本区别。我们还可以举出其他的证明。
    在“物质第一性和意识第二性”这一章里，华岗写道：“物质第一性和意识第二性，是辩证唯物论的第二个基本特征。在这个基本特徵中，我们可以看出有三个重要涵义，即：（一）物质是宇宙的本原；……（二）意识是物质的高级产物……（三）物质先于意识……”这些本是从任何一本哲学讲义中可以抄到的话，但华岗由此却作出结论说：“根据这三个基本要点，我们就可以把辩证唯物论和唯心论、机械唯物论及二元论更严格区别出来。”（一二九页）稍有哲学常识的人都知道，物质第一性和意识第二性的原理只能区别唯物主义和唯心主义，而不能区别辩证唯物主义和机械唯物主义。道理很简单，因为机械唯物主义也承认物质第一性和意识第二性，在这一点上，它和辩证唯物主义是一致的。如果以为根据这个原理，就能够把辩证唯物主义和机械唯物主义“更严格区别开来”，那就是既不懂得什么叫做机械唯物主义，也不懂得什么是唯物主义和唯心主义的区别。
    华岗这种错误观点是贯穿在“物质第一性和意识第二性”这一整章中间的。在另一个地方，华岗又写道：“……辩证唯物论肯定物质第一性和意识第二性，就可克服上述机械唯物论的缺陷……”（一三二页）这句话当然也是错误的。肯定物质第一性和意识第二性对于克服机械唯物主义的缺陷是无济于事的。实际上辩证唯物主义是由于它把辩证法和唯物主义相结合，才克服了机械唯物主义的缺陷。
    至此，人们不禁要发生怀疑，为什么华岗一再地把物质第一性和意识第二性这一哲学基本问题作为区分辩证唯物主义和机械唯物主义的标准呢？原来在华岗的书中有很多地方都违背了经典作家的指示，偷偷地把意识对物质的反作用的问题，也包含到区分唯物主义和唯心主义的哲学基本问题中间去了。
    阐明意识对物质的反作用和主观的能动作用，是辩证唯物主义者的重要任务之一，但是必须首先在思维对存在的关系这一根本问题上划清了唯物主义和唯心主义的界限，然后才能提出意识对物质的反作用问题。机械唯物主义不懂得意识的反作用，这是它的重大缺陷；但它承认物质第一性意识第二性，意识是物质的反映的原理，因此它对哲学基本问题的回答就是唯物主义的，因而也就是正确的。所以，华岗把承认不承认意识的反作用问题拉到哲学基本问题中来，虚无主义地否定了机械唯物主义对哲学基本问题回答的正确性，把它和唯心主义相提并论，这就不可免地混淆了唯物主义和唯心主义之间的明确界限。
    华岗还以庸俗唯物主义的观点，把思维运动看成是物质运动的形态之一（一○九页），把意识说成是物质运动的最高形态（三三○页）。作为物质运动形态之一的思维运动是什么呢？华岗举例说，从原始辩证法，转变到机械唯物论和唯心论辩证法，再转变到辩证唯物论；文艺思潮中从古典主义、象征主义、自然主义到批判的现实主义，再到社会主义现实主义等，都是思维运动的形态。这种说法是完全错误的。为了论证自己的观点，华岗引用了恩格斯在“自然辩证法”中的话：“物质的运动，不仅是粗糙的机械运动、单纯的位置变动，而且还是热和光、电和磁的应力、化学的化合和分解、生命、并且最后是意识。”但华岗显然不懂或故意歪曲恩格斯的这段话的意思。意识是最高级的物质——大脑皮质——运动的产物，大脑皮质的运动是思维的基础，意识是不能脱离开物质运动而存在的。恩格斯上面的一段话中所说：“物质的运动……最后是意识”就是指这个意思而言。但意识是客观物质世界的反映，它和客观存在着的物质不是同一个东西，因此，就绝不能认为意识是物质运动的一种形式，绝不能把哲学思想、科学思想、文艺思想都当做物质运动的形态。所以恩格斯在“自然辩证法”中又说：“终有一天我们一定可以用实验的方法把思维‘归结’为脑子中的分子的和化学的运动；但是难道这就把思维的本质包括无遗了吗？”这正是说，把思维看做物质运动的形式，是不能表明思维的全部本质的。
    华岗的错误说法实际上就是否定了人的意识形态和独立于人的意识以外的自然、社会之间的区别，就势必会导向把社会意识形态看做存在于人们头脑之外的客观实体的庸俗唯物主义观点。这种观点使唯物主义和唯心主义在认识论上的对立失去了意义，也就使我们无法判明什么是唯物主义，什么是唯心主义。所以正如列宁所说：“不论思想或物质，都是‘现实的’、即存在着的，——这是正确的。但是把思想叫作物质的，——这就是向混淆唯物论与唯心论方面走了错误的一步。”
      关于对唯心主义和唯物主义的历史作用的估价问题
    华岗说：“唯心论在历史发展中也曾经有过它的积极性”（五四页），并且还找出两个例子来证明他的说法是正确的：第一、笛卡儿和黑格尔的哲学都曾有过积极作用（参看五四—五五页）。第二、“在历史上还曾经出现过未成熟的阶级用唯心论的口吻来表达他们的改革要求，例如一部分空想社会主义者和过去德国与中国的农民起义，都曾带有宗教色彩。”（五五页）
    华岗这种“唯心主义有功论”是完全错误的。哲学唯心主义历来都是反动的、是反对科学、反对民主的力量。虽然在历史上，有个别唯心主义者曾经起过进步作用，但是这并不意味着唯心主义哲学本身曾经起过进步作用。个别唯心主义者所以能起进步作用，是因为他们的某些言论和行动反映了当时社会上进步阶级的利益和要求，而不是因为他们具有唯心主义的世界观或者信仰宗教的缘故。谁都知道，唯心主义者黑格尔的哲学中的积极因素就是他的辩证法中的合理的内核；至于他的唯心主义理论，却正是起着反动的、反科学的作用。笛卡儿则是一个二元论的哲学家，一方面他固然有“我思故我在”的唯心主义观点，但同时他在物理学中发展了唯物主义，以其唯物主义的自然观促进了科学和哲学的发展。笛卡儿哲学中起积极作用的也不是唯心主义，而是唯物主义。革命的群众仍抱着唯心主义的世界观，这种情形也是有的。起义的农民或者未成熟的无产阶级曾经用过“唯心论的口吻”，“带有宗教色彩”，但这是不是就能说明唯心主义是有功于农民起义或者无产阶级革命呢？显然是不能的。在革命中起积极作用的是革命的阶级及其革命要求本身，却不是他们在一定条件下所不可避免地利用或带有的“唯心论的口吻”和“宗教色彩”；事实上，这种“唯心论的口吻”和“宗教色彩”在很多情况下恰恰还妨碍了他们的革命运动的彻底程度。
    华岗在一方面认为唯心主义有功，而另一方面他又在反对机械唯物主义的名义下加罪于唯物主义。前面已经说到，华岗对于历史上的机械唯物主义是采取一笔抹煞的态度的，此外华岗还硬把庸俗唯物主义的观点也算作了机械唯物主义的罪名，说什么“机械唯物论者把意识和物质等同起来，看不见两者之间的任何区别。”（一三二页）
    机械唯物主义是唯物主义发展的一个历史阶段，在马克思主义产生以前，它曾经在历史上起过进步作用。当然机械唯物主义的全部理论是有重大的缺陷和错误的，但它对哲学基本问题的回答却是明确的，它并没有像庸俗唯物主义一样，把意识和物质等同起来。在今天，谁要宣扬机械唯物主义以反对辩证唯物主义，这固然是完全反动的、反科学的；但是像华岗这样给机械唯物主义制造出一些莫须有的罪名，否定掉马克思主义以前的唯物主义的历史作用，用以陪衬其“唯心主义有功论”，同样是反动的、反科学的。
      关于否定之否定
    华岗极端不满恩格斯把否定之否定作为辩证法的基本规律的提法，他嚷道：
    “不过无论如何，‘否定之否定’这个公式本身，就带有均衡论或循环论的性质，而且在事实上，并非一切发展都通过‘肯定、否定、否定之否定’这样的形式，因而‘否定之否定’就决不是普遍的法则。”（二五○页）
    这是公开地斥责恩格斯。这是说：“不过无论如何”，你恩格斯用这个公式总是错了！而且华岗还毒恶地打出了斯大林的旗号来反对恩格斯，反对辩证法。事实上，这是一方面歪曲恩格斯，同时又歪曲斯大林。
    马克思和恩格斯都认为否定之否定乃是辩证法的基本规律之一。马克思和恩格斯对否定之否定这一规律的内容，做了根本不同于黑格尔的唯物主义的解释。简略说来，马克思和恩格斯所论证的否定之否定规律的主要内容就是：运动是前进的、上升的、从简单到复杂、从低级到高级的过程。新事物是在旧事物的基础上产生出来的，并且吸取了旧事物中一切合理的东西。在前进的发展过程中，新与旧之间，低级与高级之间具有继承的性质。发展是螺旋式的，而不是循环，发展是过去的事物在新的更高阶段上相对的重复。这些内容是不是客观的、普遍的规律呢？当然是的。辩证唯物主义经典作家所说的否定之否定的辩证规律，并不意味着任何其他神秘的道理。华岗首先把恩格斯说的否定之否定规律歪曲为黑格尔的神秘的三段论法，然后就来攻击否定之否定规律本身，攻击恩格斯。这是历来许多马克思主义的敌人惯用的手法。
    斯大林表述辩证法的特征时，虽然没有用否定之否定这个名称，但是他不仅从未否认过否定之否定这一规律的内容，并且在量变到质变这一特征中表述了它。华岗却硬把斯大林说成是反对这个规律本身，这显然是歪曲了斯大林的原意。
    华岗在这里是用经过他的手歪曲过了的斯大林，来反对也是经过他的手歪曲过了的恩格斯。其实，恩格斯和斯大林并没有什么原则的分歧；和恩格斯、斯大林正确意见有原则分歧的是华岗的反辩证法的观点。
      关于辩证法的范畴
    华岗把辩证法的诸范畴也写得一塌糊涂。对于有些重要的范畴，如形式和内容，他根本没有提及；对于有些范畴，如因果性、必然性和偶然性、本质和现象等等，则写的极混乱、极不确切；对于有些范畴，如本质联系和非本质联系、可能性和现实性等等，则作了一些极其明显的曲解。关于这一方面的错误，陈昌曙同志和高清海同志的文章已加以指出。我们这里也要来谈一下华岗对本质联系和非本质联系、可能性和现实性这两对范畴的错误观点。
    华岗用含混的推论代替了给本质联系和非本质联系下一个明确的定义的任务，用大量毫无意义和不相干的例子代替了对这对范畴的理论阐述。
    华岗在说明什么是本质联系时举例说：辩证法和唯物论的联系、苏联和中国的联系是本质的联系；同时据他说，一切本质的联系都应当归结为“事物内部的矛盾性”（二八一页）。把华岗这两种说法联系起来，就自然会得到一个荒谬的结论：辩证法和唯物主义的关系、苏联和中国的关系都是事物内部的矛盾性的表现。
    由于华岗庸俗地简单地解释内部联系和外部联系，并以此来说明本质联系和非本质联系，于是他就断定说，社会主义阵营中各国的相互关系是本质联系，而他们同帝国主义国家之间的联系是非本质联系。这种毫无意义的推论，是把事物间复杂的、多种多样的联系简单化了的结果。其实，一个事物不仅在和多种事物的不同联系中，有本质联系和非本质联系之分；而且只就两个事物之间的联系来看，也必然是多种多样的联系，其间有本质的，也有非本质的。例如，社会主义阵营中的国家和帝国主义国家之间，不仅有非本质联系，同时也有本质联系，强大的社会主义阵营的存在和发展必然促进帝国主义体系内部的矛盾和危机，这就是一种本质的联系。
    辩证唯物主义指明：所谓本质联系，就是指在事物错综复杂的联系中存在着的一些主要的、起决定性作用的、内在的、有机的联系。所谓非本质联系，就是指一些次要的、表面的、不起决定性作用的联系。要善于区分开本质联系和非本质联系，才能够发现事物发展的根本原因和它的规律性，在实践中也才能够找到解决问题的根本方法。但是华岗的论述不仅根本没有弄清楚什么是本质联系，什么是非本质联系，而且是混淆了两种联系的性质。
    当华岗谈到可能性和现实性这对范畴的时候，他给可能性下了一个错误的定义，他说：“哲学上对于某事物的存在条件已经具备，但还不能断言其必然实现的，称为可能性”（三四四页）。这种说法是错误的，因为并不是一切的可能性和必然性都不相容。有些可以“断言其必然实现的”现象，亦即合乎事物发展规律会一定实现的现象，在未实现前，仍然是可能性。例如，我国有建成社会主义的可能性，这当然不是说“不能断言”社会主义在我国必然实现。可见，虽然不是一切可能性都有其实现的必然性，但符合于必然性的可能性却的确是存在的。正因此，合乎规律的发展过程同样是一个变可能性为现实性的过程。在这个过程中，主观能动性的作用仍然是巨大的。像华岗这样不承认未实现的必然性也是可能性，就会使我们忽视主观的能动作用，消极地坐待必然性的实现，陷入宿命论的泥坑。
    在另一处，华岗又从另一个角度发表了一个谬论，结果也同样会达到否定人们在变可能性为现实性的过程中的能动作用。他说：“事物内部的矛盾性，使事物的发展具有多种可能性，但在一定条件、时间和地点，其中只有一种是实在的可能性”（三五一页）。这是完全不对的。正因为“事物内部的矛盾性，使事物的发展具有了多种可能性”，所以在任何“条件、时间和地点”下，任何一个事物的发展就都会起码具有两种实在的可能性，即新的、先进的东西发展的可能性，和与此相对立的旧东西的暂时保存和反动的落后的东西暂时胜利的可能性——虽然后一个可能性并非就是必然要实现的可能性。——一种实在的可能性单独存在的情况，是不会有的。正因如此，主观能动性在争取一种实在的可能性变为现实性，排除另一种实在的可能性变为现实性的活动中才有巨大意义。例如，在我国争取社会主义建设成功的实在可能性变为现实性，防止和排除帝国主义势力、封建势力复辟的实在可能性变为现实性的过程中，共产党、人民政权和全国人民的活动就起着决定性的作用。可见，华岗的错误见解是会在实践上起妨碍人们发挥主观能动性的作用，这对革命事业和科学发展是非常有害的观点。
    应当指出，华岗的书中关于可能性和现实性的一节，大部分是抄袭了一个青年作者的文章（即章世鸿作：“论可能性和现实性及可能性向现实转变的途径”，见“文史哲”一九五四年第三期），但上举这些错误都是华岗自己的“创作”。
      混乱的用语和违反常识的错误
    在华岗的“大纲”中，混乱的用语、违反常识的错误更是不可胜数，我们在这里只拣几个例子来展览一下：
    他不顾无产阶级和资产阶级同时产生的常识，硬说先有了资产阶级，然后才有了无产阶级（十九页）；他不顾运动和物质是没有“始”也没有“终”的常识，而说“规律是和运动着的物质相始终的”
  （二九○页）；他不顾时间过去就再也回不来这个连七、八岁孩子都可以懂得的常识，硬说时间和事物的发展过程一样，是一个“忽左忽右，忽前忽后”的过程，是一个可以“后退”的“螺旋式的而非直线式的过程”（一一六—一一七页）；他不顾价值规律在社会主义制度下只是在生产领域内不起调节者的作用，在消费领域内仍然起调节者作用的原理，硬把斯大林“……价值法则在我国社会主义生产中，并没有调节的作用……”一语窜改成“价值法则在社会主义制度下不能起调节者的作用”（三四七页）；他以其“翻天妙手”把辩证论者黑格尔写成了形而上学者（三三五页），把主观唯心主义的流派马赫主义说成是二元论（五二页），把十八世纪英国大资产阶级的哲学家贝克莱说成是“反映了中世纪封建主的需要”的“新柏拉图主义的唯我论”的代表（六七页）；甚至他还制造出了“资产阶级个体农民的制度”（二六○页）这一类荒唐的术语。
    三、庸俗、荒唐的联系实际
    从形式上看，华岗的“大纲”似乎也颇为重视联系实际，并且在序言里还有意地把这一点夸张了一番。但是，第一，“大纲”中专门讲实践意义的几节，是极端一般化的，不仅空洞抽象，而且也有凭剽窃手段弄来的。其次，华岗在全书中不理睬我们党的整风经验，根本没有具体说明辩证唯物主义和我们实际工作的关系，尤其是几乎完全没有提到运用辩证唯物主义改造思想的问题。第三，特别令人不能容忍的是华岗进行“联系实际”时举的例子。以下就是华岗的所谓“联系实际”的一些标本。
    第一种类型：纯粹字面上的联系。例如在八十八页上华岗写道：
    “唯能论是唯心论的变种，是唯心论在科学上的反映，是和最反动的行动主义相结合的，也正像美帝国主义一样，认为只要有能力，有原子弹，就可以冒险地进行它的种种野蛮行动。”
    自然，唯能论是反动的、反科学的，是唯心论的一个流派，它企图证明“物质消灭了”，只有“能”保存着。可是它和倚仗“能力”的美帝国主义的行动主义有什么直接联系呢？如果有，应当清楚地指出来；华岗却没有这样作，他只是认为：唯能论是讲“能”字的，行动主义也是讲“能”字的，所以就“相结合”了。这是纯粹字面上联系的第一个标本。
    再一个例子，在九十五页上他写道：
    “宇宙的物质性和统一性的思想，是马克思列宁主义政党正确地认识世界和在实践中改造世界的指针。共产主义的宇宙观……把……辩证方法和……唯物理论的有机统一，体现于一己之身。……认识和掌握这种统一的科学宇宙观，……具有莫大的现实意义。……如果没有工人阶级的统一，如果没有革命政党的统一，就没有革命的胜利和工人阶级的解放。”
    这样来说明宇宙的物质性和统一性的原理的实践意义。可以说，纯粹是胡扯。华岗不过看到了“统一”这两个字，所以就从物质世界的“统一”性扯到辩证法和唯物论的“统一”性，然后又扯到党和革命队伍“统一”的重要性。我们知道，世界的统一性的根本内容是指：客观世界就是运动着的物质，而意识是物质的产物，因此世界并不是有两个互不相关的实体——物质和意识，世界的统一性就在于它的物质性，这一些唯物主义的原理。那末，试问华岗，如果有人破坏党和革命队伍的统一，难道就是意识向物质“闹独立性”的表现吗？这是纯粹字面上联系的第二个标本。
    这种“联系实际”的戏法，只不过证明了华岗原来根本不懂得或者有意模糊唯能论、行动主义、辩证法和唯物论的统一、党和革命队伍的统一这一些问题的实质。
    第二种类型：混乱不同的原理。本来讲的是这一个原理，联系实际时却用的完全是另一个原理，得出些风马牛不相及的结论。例如他在讲空间和时间是物质存在的形式，空间和时间的物质性时，突然大谈起空间、时间的重要性来，似乎是有人否认过无论做什么事都需要一定空间、时间这个常识，所以他来仗义声讨。在这里，他还特别举了两个例子来武装自己。一个例子是说：中国的抗日战争和苏联的卫国战争之所以能够胜利，就是因为中苏两国都具有大国这个“空间”，又都是处于二十世纪三十年代这个“时间”，再加上其他条件，所以胜利了。另一个例子是：我们培养建设人材，也需要一定的“空间”（学校、教室、实验室、实习场所等等）和一定的“时间”（小学六年，中学六年、大学四年）（参看一一一页——一一三页）。
    华岗大约自己也弄不清楚，在这里说了一堆空间、时间重要的废话，到底是要解决什么问题。原来在前一个例子中他是把一切以时间、地点、条件为转移的原理代替了空间和时间是物质存在的形式 的原理。华岗用诡辩主义的手段，以一个原理代替了另一个原理，结果使两个重要的原理都失去了它的光彩和价值，自然更谈不上解决实际问题了。
    第三种类型：任意缩小唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争范围。华岗在八十八页上写道：
    “……世界主义是唯心论最反动、最卑劣的发展，国际主义是唯物论最高和最彻底的表现。国际主义和世界主义的斗争，粉碎和清除世界主义在思想领域……的影响，就是目前哲学战线上的主要任务。”
    这是有意缩小两种思想体系，两种哲学斗争的范围，当然国际主义和世界主义的斗争是社会主义思想体系和资本主义思想体系间、辩证唯物主义和唯心主义间斗争的重要的一方面，但却不能说这是两大思想体系斗争的全部内容或“主要的”“最高”的任务。我们近年来和胡适、胡风以及梁漱溟等人为代表的反动思想的斗争，只用国际主义和世界主义的斗争绝不能说明其全部的或者“主要的”内容的。我们必须从各个方面，特别是从认识论上，对唯心主义的反动世界观展开全面批判。
    能不能解决革命过程中提出的实际问题，是辨别真假马克思主义者的试金石。在联系实际的问题上，不懂得马克思主义的教条主义者以及蓄意反对马克思主义的冒牌马克思主义者，都免不了把狐狸尾巴露出来的。华岗在联系实际方面的荒唐无稽，就暴露出了他对辩证唯物主义完全无知的原形。
    总之，华岗的“辩证唯物论大纲”是一本充满了剽窃，也充满了荒谬论点的坏书。撕下像华岗这一类冒牌学者的假面具，驳斥华岗所散布的一些荒谬论点，正是学术界义不容辞的责任。
