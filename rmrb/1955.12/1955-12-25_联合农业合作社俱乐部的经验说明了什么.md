What the Experience of the Joint Agricultural Cooperative Club Shows
Yang Jie, Director of the Anhui Provincial Cultural Bureau

The Luqiao District Joint Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, is a cooperative with a two-year history. Simultaneously with the socialist transformation of agriculture, the cooperative launched a mass socialist cultural construction campaign. The members leveled rocky hills, built an open-air stage on them, and constructed a "small club" that could accommodate more than 400 people. They bought kerosene lamps, basketballs, musical instruments, and books, and they unanimously called these things "socialist construction." The club carried out a variety of amateur cultural activities. These activities and experiences of the joint cooperative have refreshed the minds of those of us engaged in rural cultural work. Because it has shown us many things.

First, it shows that today's rural economic base, the peasants' spiritual outlook, and way of life are undergoing profound and fundamental changes, requiring cultural work to catch up and better serve agricultural cooperation. Due to the rapid development of the agricultural cooperation movement, rural cultural activities are not too many now, but too few; not unwelcome by the masses, but especially welcome; not optional, but very necessary. Many peasants say: "Nowhere to buy books, nobody to teach songs, can't see movies, really makes people anxious!" The joint agricultural cooperative itself has built more than ten cultural organizations and activity places such as clubs, people's schools, amateur theatrical troupes, production technology research groups, libraries, hygiene groups, open-air stages, and ball fields. In the past three years, it has performed 85 times, lectured 63 times, screened slides 40 times, held 11 exhibitions, and conducted sports activities almost every day, with a cultural activity day every half month. In these cultural activities, many new people and new things have emerged, such as grandparents and grandchildren singing folk songs on the same stage, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law dancing hand in hand, fathers and sons learning culture in the same class, and sisters-in-law teaching each other to read; there have also been "cultural families," such as the family of cooperative member Jiang Daofa, with five people attending people's school, three of whom also participate in the theatrical troupe, and the old couple participating in the hygiene group and production technology research group. Here, no matter day or night, everywhere you hear loud singing and happy laughter.

From the fact that the members of the joint agricultural cooperative love culture and need culture so much, we can see that agricultural cooperation has improved the peasants' material life, and they now not only require double-wheeled, double-shared plows and dragon-bone waterwheels, require mechanized farming, and require increased production; in addition, there are "five requirements," which are: to improve politics, to learn culture, to learn the experience of managing cooperatives, to learn production technical knowledge, and to have cultural entertainment. The purposefulness of their cultural requirements is clear. Like Jiang Daozhen, the leader of the women's production team, said: "I want to learn culture well and become a tractor driver!"

Cultural activities themselves have also brought many benefits to the members, thus further increasing their enthusiasm for cultural activities. Due to the research and improvement of production technology and the implementation of the "three reforms" (three reform measures in Anhui agricultural production), the main food crops have increased production this year; due to the establishment of people's schools and winter schools, 14 work recorders and accountants have been trained for the cooperative; due to the development of health publicity work, the members have developed good hygiene habits, reducing disease and death. With such vivid facts related to the vital interests of the masses, how can they not need culture?

Due to the organization of agricultural production cooperatives, production and lifestyles have undergone fundamental changes, thus bringing favorable conditions for cultural activities. During the day, production teams and groups produce separately, and at night they study together, rehearse plays together, and hold meetings together. On holidays, they play ball together, do group dances, and play games, so that the members are together every day, warmly and closely, becoming inseparable partners.

Second, it shows that the content of rural cultural activities must obey and serve the political movements of the Party in various periods, and at the same time must often obey and serve agricultural production, and must continuously meet the growing cultural needs of the broad masses of peasants. The cultural activities of the joint agricultural cooperative club first revolved around the political movements of various periods, using socialist ideology to educate the masses and criticize the spontaneous capitalist tendencies existing among the masses, thereby raising the socialist consciousness of the masses. In the past few years, the club has used more than a dozen cultural and artistic forms such as slides, exhibitions, lectures, broadcasting, newspaper reading, and opera performances to focus on publicizing domestic and international current events and the general line, liberating Taiwan, general elections, grain three-fixings, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and other political struggle tasks and central tasks. During the summer harvest this year, it was found that some people in the cooperative were not active in production, some went to visit relatives and did not return to the cooperative for seven or eight days, and some clamored to withdraw from the cooperative; at the same time, it was also found that reactionary rich peasants and bad elements outside the cooperative were spreading rumors and sabotage. In response to this situation, the club promptly screened the "New Road" (reflecting the content of the struggle against rich peasants) slide show, held a lecture meeting, and used the criminal facts of the bad elements arrested locally for sabotaging the cooperative to educate the masses, so that the members opened their eyes. Later, the cooperative was consolidated, and some members developed complacency and were unwilling to engage in expanding the cooperative, saying: "We are better than the bottom, but not as good as the top, we are enough now." The club exhibited pictures such as "The Soviet Union's Today is Our Tomorrow" and repeatedly read "A Letter from Soviet Peasants to Chinese Peasants"; and through various forms, publicized and introduced the "Spark Collective Farm" and the province's "Huaiguang Collective Farm," greatly encouraging the members' confidence in taking the socialist road.

Secondly, the club constantly obeys and serves production, carrying out propaganda and mobilization and popularizing production technology. They are good at putting forward production requirements and mobilization slogans based on the characteristics of different seasons. For example, when carrying out the manure accumulation campaign, the club used the honor roll to commend the example of female cooperative members Jiang Daozhen and Peng Tongying beating 330 jin of rice seedlings a day (in the past, men beat at most more than 80 jin a day), which set off a heat wave of beating rice seedlings. In the short period of 25 days, the whole cooperative beat more than 180,000 jin of rice seedlings. They also use short, concise, and pithy literary and artistic forms to mobilize in the fields. For example, during the land reclamation and rush planting last year, members of the amateur troupe organized a folk song medley with the theme of land reclamation and rush planting. The female members sang:
	“Chives bloom, balls hit balls, land reclamation and production increase, cheer up, rush planting, we do it, don't be distracted.” The male members then sang: "The iron rake is polished brightly, land reclamation is like going to the battlefield, work together with one heart, and see who is on the honor roll first." In this way, the mood was encouraged, and the task of reclaiming 80 mu of land that was originally planned to be completed in ten days was completed in seven days. In particular, in the publicity of production technology, they are good at using easy-to-understand, simple, and clear publicity forms, such as using models, physical exhibitions, and peasant proverbs and ballads to introduce local traditional experience and promote advanced experience from other places.

The club also carries out mass cultural learning and recreational sports and health activities. The perennial people's school here has been consolidated, and 35 young and middle-aged people regularly participate in learning. The two amateur theatrical troupes and the folk song choir have a total of more than 60 people, and have performed 85 times in three years. The programs are all healthy in content and rich and colorful in form. The activity methods are also flexible and diverse. At ordinary times, during the spare time of production, they play games and do group dances; during the "resting" time in the fields, they read newspapers and look at pictures; they also shout folk songs while producing; there are literary and artistic performance evenings at festivals or celebrations of harvest and other gatherings; especially on this day of cultural activities, various cultural activities are carried out in a concentrated manner, and everyone enjoys themselves all day long.

Third, it shows that to make mass cultural activities regular and mass-based, it is necessary to strengthen leadership, rely on the masses, and vigorously carry out popularization work. Some cultural workers carry out cultural activities in rural areas, not relying on the masses, but singing "one-man shows" themselves. Therefore, they are lively wherever they go, and they are deserted if they leave. On the other hand, the work of popularization and improvement is not enough. Therefore, there are more "single fights" and more "old routines," which are met with dissatisfaction from the masses, saying: "You have performed enough, I am tired of watching it."

The cultural activities of the joint agricultural cooperative club have solved the two main contradictions of the cultural activities can not be regular:

One contradiction is the contradiction between the "single fight" and "old routine" of the content and form of cultural activities and the masses' demands for more and better things. The club vigorously promoted the content and forms that are urgently needed for the current central work and mass production and life, such as slides, exhibitions, newspapers, books, production technology research, and small and diverse cultural activities; at the same time, it also paid attention to exploring and promoting folk art forms. At the beginning, they only engaged in the folk song "Sisters-in-law Singing to Flowers" that everyone was most familiar with. Then, more and more people sang, and the songs became richer and richer. Then, the club paid attention to helping the masses improve the level of artistic activities. For example, local folk songs are very rich, but because the essence and dross are mixed together, the masses are unwilling to sing. Under the guidance of the cultural center station, the club processed and sorted out the folk songs, changed the singing form, and added instrumental accompaniment, which was very popular. After the "Sisters-in-law Singing to Flowers" was improved, it quickly spread to the whole district, the whole county, and the whole province, and also participated in the National Folk Art Performance. In this way, the club greatly improved and enriched the content of cultural activities, retained 35 programs, and had "capital" to carry out regular activities.

Another contradiction is the contradiction between cultural activities and production. The agricultural cooperative first strengthened unified leadership. The various organizations under the joint cooperative club are led by the president of the cooperative, the propaganda committee member of the party branch, the party's propagandist, the cooperative's culture and education committee member, graduates of senior primary schools, accountants, work recorders, male and female production team leaders, and production activists. Because the club is built on the basis of the cooperative, the party branch and the administrative leaders of the cooperative concurrently manage cultural work, and the backbone of production is also mostly activists in cultural activities. Therefore, there will be no phenomena of separation from leadership and mutual exclusion. With the leadership of the cooperative unified, the content of the activities can closely serve production and central tasks according to the leadership's intentions. At the same time, various cultural organizations are established and carry out activities in units of production organizations, so they can adapt to the production characteristics of the members being concentrated and dispersed during the production season, adapting to local conditions, adapting to the times, and flexibly using activity methods. For example, people's schools implement a five-holiday system (transplanting seedlings, stripping head hemp, stripping second hemp, harvesting rice, and the Spring Festival) during busy and semi-busy farming seasons, striving for the initiative in teaching; the method of reading newspapers: read them in the fields when concentrated production, read them in people's schools during slack farming seasons, and read them in hemp yards when stripping hemp; the cultural activity day is not always performing new plays, but during busy farming seasons, perform some short and pithy ready-made programs, which ensures the normal development of activities.

The experience of the cultural activities of the joint agricultural cooperative tells us profoundly that in rural areas that have been or are about to be cooperativized, a cultural revolution has already begun, and the construction of socialist culture has begun. Although these activities are only the beginning, they reflect an important aspect of the great and historically significant mass socialist cultural construction. If we do not see this and do not actively speed up our pace to catch up, we will be thrown far behind by the boiling reality.

    联合农业合作社俱乐部的经验说明了什么
    安徽省文化局局长　杨杰
    安徽省巢县鲁桥区联合农业生产合作社是个有两年历史的社。在农业社会主义改造运动的同时，社里开展了群众性的社会主义文化建设工作。社员们把石山铲成平地，在上面搭了露天舞台，盖了可容四百多人的“小俱乐部”。买了汽油灯，买了篮球、乐器和图书，他们众口一辞，把这些叫做“社会主义建设”。俱乐部开展了多种多样的业余文艺活动。联合社的这些活动和经验，使我们从事农村文化工作的人头脑为之一新。因为它向我们说明了很多东西。
    第一，它说明了今天农村的经济基础、农民的精神面貌和生活方式，都在起着深刻的根本性的变化，要求文化工作迎头赶上去，更好地为农业合作化服务。由于农业合作化运动的飞跃发展，现在农村的文化活动，不是太多，而是太少；不是群众不欢迎，而是特别欢迎；不是可有可无，而是非常需要。许多农民说：“买书找不到门，教歌找不到人，电影看不到，实在急坏人！”联合农业社自己建设了俱乐部、民校、业余剧团、生产技术研究组、图书室、卫生组、露天舞台和球场等十多项文化组织和活动场所。三年来，共演出八十五场，讲演六十三次，幻灯放映四十次，展览十一次，体育活动几乎天天都有，每半月过一次文化活动日。在这些文化活动中，出现了不少新人新事，如祖孙同台唱山歌，婆媳手拉手跳舞，父子同班学文化，姑嫂互教识字；还出现了“文化之家”，像社员江道发一家就有五个人上民校，其中三个人又参加了剧团，老夫妻俩参加了卫生组和生产技术研究组。在这里，无论白天和黑夜，到处都听到嘹亮的歌声和愉快的谈笑声。
    从联合农业社的社员们这样热爱文化和需要文化的事实，我们可以看到：农业合作化改善了农民的物质生活，他们现在不但要求有双轮双铧犁和龙骨水车，要求用机器耕种，要求多增产；此外，还有“五要”，就是：要提高政治，要学习文化，要学习管理合作社的经验，要学习生产技术知识，要文化娱乐。他们对文化要求的目的性是明确的。像妇女生产队长江道珍说：“我要学好文化，做个拖拉机手！”
    文化活动本身也给社员们带来了很多好处，因而也就更提高他们对文化活动的积极性。由于研究和改进了生产技术，推行了“三改”（安徽农业生产方面的三项改革办法）办法，今年主要粮食都增了产；由于开办了民校和冬学，就为社里培养了十四名记工员和会计；由于卫生宣传工作的开展，社员们养成了良好的卫生习惯，减少了疾病和死亡。像这些关系到群众切身利益的活生生的事实，他们还能不需要文化吗？
    由于组织了农业生产合作社，生产和生活方式都起了根本变化，因此，也给文化活动带来了有利条件，白天分队分组生产，晚上在一起上学，一起排戏，一起开会，假日又大伙儿打球，跳集体舞，做游戏，使社员们天天在一块，天天亲亲热热，成为拆不开的伙伴了。
    第二，它说明了农村文化活动的内容，必须服从和服务于党在各个时期的政治运动，同时又要经常地服从和服务于农业生产，并且要不断地满足广大农民日益增长的文化需要。联合农业社俱乐部的文化活动，首先是围绕各个时期的政治运动，用社会主义思想教育群众，批判群众中存在的自发资本主义倾向，从而提高了群众的社会主义觉悟。几年内，俱乐部曾经运用幻灯、展览、讲演、广播、读报、戏曲演出等十几种文化艺术形式，集中地宣传了国内外时事和总路线、解放台湾、普选、粮食三定、肃反等政治斗争任务和中心工作。今年夏收时，发现社里有些人生产不积极，有的看亲戚一去七、八天不回社，有的闹着退社；同时，也发现社外反动富农分子和坏分子在造谣破坏。针对着这一情况，俱乐部就及时地放映了“新路”（反映对富农进行斗争的内容）幻灯片，举办了演讲会，用当地被逮捕的坏分子破坏合作社的罪恶事实来教育群众，使社员们擦亮了眼睛。后来合作社巩固了，有的社员又产生自满情绪，不愿再搞扩社联社，他们说：“我们比上不足，比下有余，现在够了。”俱乐部就展览了“苏联的今天就是我们的明天”等图片，反复讲读“苏联农民给中国农民的一封信”；又通过各种形式，宣传介绍了“星火集体农庄”和本省的“淮光集体农庄”，大大鼓舞了社员走社会主义道路的信心。
    其次，俱乐部经常地服从和服务于生产，开展宣传鼓动和普及生产技术。他们善于根据各个不同季节的特点提出生产要求和鼓动口号，如在开展积肥运动时，俱乐部就用光荣榜表扬女社员江道珍、彭同英一天打秧草三百三十斤（过去男的每天最多打八十多斤）的事例，掀起了打秧草的热潮，在短短的二十五天当中，全社共打秧草十八万多斤。又运用短小精悍的文艺形式，在田间地头进行鼓动，如在去年开荒抢种的时候，参加业余剧团的社员就以开荒抢种为题，组织了山歌联唱，女社员唱：
  “韭菜开花球打球，开荒增产要加油，抢种生活我们做，不要一心挂两头。”男社员就接着唱：“铁扒磨得亮光光，开荒好比上战场，齐心合力加油干，看谁先上光荣榜。”这样，就鼓舞了情绪，原计划要十天才能完成的八十亩地开荒任务，结果七天就完成了。特别是生产技术的宣传，他们善于运用通俗易懂、简单明确的宣传形式，如用模型、实物展览和农民谚语、歌谣来介绍本地的传统经验和推行外地的先进经验。
    俱乐部也开展了群众性的文化学习和文娱体育卫生活动。这里的常年民校，已经是巩固了，有三十五个青壮年经常地参加学习。两个业余剧团和民歌合唱队共六十多人，三年内共演出八十五场，演出节目都是内容健康、形式丰富而多采的。在活动方法上也是灵活多样的，平时生产空隙时间，就做游戏、跳集体舞；田间“歇活”的时候，就读报、看图画；正在生产时也要喊喊山歌；在节日或庆祝丰收等集会的时候，都有文艺演出晚会；特别是文化活动日的这天，更是集中地进行各种文化活动，大家尽欢一日。
    第三，它说明了群众文化活动要做到经常化和群众性，必须加强领导，依靠群众，大力开展普及工作。有些文化工作人员在农村开展文化活动，不是依靠群众，而是自己唱“独角戏”，因此，他们到了哪里，哪里就热闹了，如果离开哪里，哪里就冷清了。另一方面，普及和提高工作做的不够，因此，“单打一”多，“老一套”多，遭到群众不满地说：“你演够了，我看厌了。”
    联合农业社俱乐部的文化活动解决了文化活动不能经常化的两个主要矛盾：
    一个矛盾是文化活动内容和形式的“单打一”“老一套”和群众要求多、要求好的矛盾。俱乐部大力提倡了为当前中心工作和群众生产、生活所迫切需要的内容和形式，如幻灯、展览、报纸、图书、生产技术研究和小型多样的文艺活动；同时，也注意发掘和推广了民间艺术形式，开始时，他们只搞大家最熟悉的民歌“姑嫂对花”，接着唱的人越来越多，歌子也就越唱越丰富。接着，俱乐部就注意帮助群众提高艺术活动的水平。例如当地的民歌是很丰富的，但是由于精华糟粕掺杂在一起，群众不愿意演唱。俱乐部就在文化馆站的辅导下，将民歌加工整理，改变了演唱形式，配上乐器伴奏，就很受欢迎。像“姑嫂对花”提高后，很快就普及到全区、全县、全省，还参加了全国民间艺术会演。这样，俱乐部就大大地提高和丰富了文化活动内容，保留了三十五个节目，开展经常性的活动就有了“本钱”。
    另一个矛盾是文化活动和生产的矛盾。农业社首先加强了统一领导。联合社俱乐部下面的各种组织，都分别由社长、党支部宣传委员、党的宣传员、社文教委员、高小毕业生、会计员、记工员、男女生产队长和生产上的积极分子担任领导骨干。由于俱乐部建立在社的基础上，党支部和社的行政领导，兼管文化工作，生产上的骨干又大都是文化活动中的积极分子，因此，就不会发生脱离领导和相互排斥的现象。社的领导统一了，活动内容就能根据领导意图紧密地服务于生产和中心任务。同时，各项文化组织，以生产组织为单位建立和开展活动，也就能适应生产季节和社员们集中和分散的生产特点，因地制宜，因时制宜，灵活运用活动方法。如民校在农忙半农忙季节，就实行五假制（栽秧、剥头麻、剥二麻、割稻、春节），争取教学的主动性；读报的方法：集中生产时就在田间读，农闲时在民校读，剥麻时就在麻场读；文化活动日也不是每次都演新戏，农忙时就演出一些短小精悍的现成节目，这样就保证了活动的正常开展。
    联合农业社的文化活动的经验，深刻地告诉了我们：在已经合作化了或将要合作化的农村里，已经开始在进行着文化革命，开始在建设社会主义文化。虽然这些活动仅仅是开端，但是，它是反映着伟大的具有历史意义的群众性的社会主义文化建设的一个重要方面。如果我们不看到这一点，不积极加快脚步赶上去，就要被沸腾的现实远远抛弃在后面。
