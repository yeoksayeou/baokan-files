Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 9th. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company completed its total production value plan and labor productivity plan for this year on the 7th, ahead of schedule. Compared with last year, the total production value increased by 22.86 percent, and labor productivity increased by 19.19 percent. It is estimated that by the end of the year, in addition to completing the annual production increase plan, Anshan Iron and Steel Company can also increase a large amount of wealth for the country.

This year, the vast number of workers and staff of Angang have made a series of improvements in management and production technology. The unit output of each open hearth furnace and blast furnace and the hourly rolling volume of the rolling mill have been significantly improved this year compared with last year. This year, from January to September, the average effective volume of the blast furnace occupied for smelting one ton of iron has been reduced from 0.927 cubic meters last year to 0.862 cubic meters. From January to September this year, the entire company implemented more than 890 rationalization proposals put forward by employees, creating a wealth of more than 3.2 million yuan for the country. Due to the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers and staff, and the earnest study of Soviet advanced experience, the steelmaking plant and the primary rolling mill both created the highest monthly output since the start of production in October this year.

This year, the newly built and renovated automated iron-smelting furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and coke ovens in Angang have been put into production, which has significantly increased the output of many products of the company.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th. The factories of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company completed the total output value plan for the whole year one month ahead of schedule, and completed the production plans for steel and steel materials for the whole year ahead of schedule on December 3rd and November 19th, respectively.

This year, the workers and staff of various factories have promoted many important advanced experiences and implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts. Now, each open hearth furnace has implemented a fixed-material steelmaking system, and the advanced Soviet experience of thick-layer sintering method is used to burn and repair the furnace bottom, and the rapid cold repair method is used to repair the furnace, so the steelmaking time of the open hearth furnace is generally shortened, and the furnace repair time is also greatly reduced. Bakelite bearings, which can save a lot of electricity, have also been widely used in Soviet hole-type design and on rolling mills.

In the second half of this year, various factories launched inter-factory competitions. The steelmaking workers of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant formally promoted rapid steelmaking in the inter-factory competition. From late October to the end of November, a total of 166 furnaces of rapid steelmaking were produced.

The workers and staff of various factories have brought into play the production potential of the original equipment, and produced many more tons of steel and steel materials in the first eleven months of this year than in the same period last year. In addition, they also successfully trial-produced more than 20 new products.

    鞍山、上海两钢铁公司
    提前完成今年总产值计划
    新华社鞍山九日电　鞍山钢铁公司在七日提前完成了今年生产总值计划和劳动生产率计划。和去年相比，生产总值增长了百分之二十二点八六，劳动生产率提高了百分之十九点一九，预计到年底鞍山钢铁公司除完成全年增产计划以外，还可以为国家再增产大批财富。
    今年鞍钢广大职工在管理方面和生产技术方面作了一系列的改进。各平炉、高炉的单位产量和轧钢厂的小时轧钢量今年都比去年有了显著提高。今年上半年各高炉平均每炼一吨铁所占用的高炉有效容积，已经由去年零点九二七立方公尺降低到零点八六二立方公尺。今年一月到九月全公司实现了职工们提出的八百九十多件合理化建议，给国家创造了三百二十多万元的财富。由于广大职工发挥了积极性和创造性，并且认真学习了苏联先进经验，炼钢厂、初轧厂今年十月份都创造了开工生产以来月产量的最高纪录。
    今年鞍钢新建改建的自动化炼铁炉、平炉和炼焦炉等工程投入生产，使全公司许多产品的产量有了显著增加。
    新华社上海十日电　上海钢铁公司各厂提前一个月完成了今年全年的总产值计划，并且分别在十二月三日和十一月十九日提前完成全年的钢和钢材的生产计划。
    各厂的职工们今年推广了许多重要的先进经验和执行了苏联专家的建议。现在，每一座平炉都实行了定料炼钢制，并且采用了苏联先进经验厚层烧结法来烧补炉底和采用了快速冷修法来修炉，因而平炉炼钢时间普遍缩短，修炉时间也大大减少。在轧钢机上还普遍采用了苏联的孔型设计和可以节省大量电力的胶木轴瓦。
    各厂在今年下半年展开了厂际竞赛。上海第三钢厂炼钢工人在厂际竞赛中正式推行了快速炼钢，从十月下旬到十一月底一共炼出了一百六十六炉快速炼钢。
    各厂职工发挥了原有设备的生产潜力，今年前十一个月比去年同时期多生产了许多吨钢和钢材。另外他们还试制成功了二十几种新产品。
