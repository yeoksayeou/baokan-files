    Produce More New Farm Tools of Good Quality and Low Price

    The agricultural cooperative movement in China's vast rural areas is developing at an unprecedented speed. This directly presents the industrial sector with an urgent task: to adapt to the current needs of agricultural development and supply a sufficient number of new-style farm tools and agricultural machinery that are of good quality and low price.

    The recent National Farm Tool Manufacturing Workers Conference determined the 1956 farm tool production tasks. The output of double-wheeled double (single) plowshares should reach 2.36 million units, an increase of more than threefold compared to this year; the output of major farm tools such as seeders and harvesters should also increase by one to three times; local state-owned machinery industries should also manufacture 62 kinds of new-style animal-powered farm tools, improved farm tools, and agricultural product processing tools, totaling more than 14.7 million pieces. The conference required that all farm tools must be of good quality and low cost, and must be produced in accordance with drawings and technical standards, vigorously reduce the rejection rate, and reduce the production cost of eleven products such as double-wheeled double (single) plowshares and seeders by 20 to 45 percent respectively compared to this year. This is a glorious task for the current farm tool manufacturing industry.

    In the past few years, farm tool production has gradually met the needs of rural areas, helping to improve the level of agricultural production. However, judging from the current situation of farm tool production, there are still many difficulties in completing the farm tool production tasks for next year. In the past, there was a lack of overall planning, there were many unreasonable phenomena in labor organization, many technical problems were not well resolved, and conservative ideas were quite serious, resulting in high rejection rates, high product prices, and few varieties and poor quality. The rework rate of plowshares manufactured by the state-owned Lingshan Farm Tool Factory is as high as 20 percent, and the situation in many local state-owned factories and joint state-private factories is even more serious. In addition, there is a large increase in production at present, and many products have rarely or never been produced before, so there will certainly be many problems.

    However, after this National Farm Tool Conference, farm tool production has been comprehensively planned. As long as production is organized step by step, labor productivity is improved, technical work is comprehensively strengthened, process regulations are vigorously improved, production tools are improved, advanced operating methods are promoted, and inspection work is strengthened to ensure the improvement of product quality and the reduction of costs, cost management and trial production of new products are strengthened, the level of enterprise management and production capacity can be continuously improved.

    Farm tool manufacturing enterprises have great potential to be tapped. For example, at present, the labor volume per unit product for manufacturing medium-sized double plowshares is 8 hours in some cases, and 17 or 18 hours in others; the unit product cost is 76 yuan in some cases, and 105 yuan in others; some factories spend 5 hours more per medium-sized double plowshare than ordinary factories, but the molding man-hours for castings can be reduced by half compared to ordinary factories. This unbalanced phenomenon fully illustrates that farm tool manufacturing enterprises have great potential capacity.

    Now, the factory workers who directly produce agricultural tools have taken active action to support the agricultural cooperative movement and have created outstanding achievements. In late October, the double-wheeled double plowshare workshop of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory saw 20 new production records; in November, the cost of each double plowshare in the Hubei Farm Tool Factory was reduced by 10 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3 fen compared to the original plan; after improving tools and adjusting labor organization, the workers in the assembly workshop of the Kaifeng Machinery Factory have increased from assembling 220 units per day to 300 units; Liu Hanyi, a young worker at the Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory, improved the operating method of polishing plowshare blades, increasing from polishing 70 pieces per day to 320 pieces. Since the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory initiated an inter-factory labor competition to support agricultural cooperation, which has been responded to by many factories across the country, the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers in the farm tool manufacturing industry for labor competition has reached a climax.

    After the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory put forward its initiative, 28 new records were created in the first five days of December; after the Shenyang Heating Equipment Factory passed a resolution to respond to the initiative on December 4, the rejection rate of worker Xing Kuishi's agricultural tool 202 parts dropped from 20 percent to 0.37 percent; Xia Jianzhang, a worker at the Shanxi Provincial Machinery Factory, increased the quota of ground wheel axles from 75 pieces to 220 pieces. In just ten days, man-hour consumption in various factories has been continuously reduced, product costs have been repeatedly reduced, and advanced experiences have been continuously created. These have greatly encouraged people's confidence in completing the plan.

    At present, more than 40 farm tool and machinery factories have participated in the inter-factory competition to support agricultural cooperation. Every enterprise participating in the competition should pay attention not only to completing the quantity of products, but also to especially ensuring the quality of the products, so that every farm tool sent to the farmers is strong and durable and suitable for the needs of local farmers. In the competition, it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon that may occur of reducing quality due to rushing the quantity. It is necessary to constantly educate all workers, technicians, and managers in the enterprise, so that they understand that only by manufacturing strong, convenient, and durable farm tools can the purpose of improving agricultural production and promoting agricultural cooperation be truly achieved, and can a foundation be laid for the further promotion of new-style farm tools and agricultural machinery. Therefore, all farm tool manufacturing workers, technicians, and managers must comprehensively take large quantity, good quality, and low price as the goal of the competition.

    Organizing all farm tool manufacturing workers to complete next year's farm tool production tasks is the greatest support for agricultural cooperation. The development of inter-factory labor competition will undoubtedly play a huge organizational role. Party committees and government industrial departments at all levels and in relevant enterprises must include this work in the overall plan of agricultural cooperation and actively strengthen leadership. The production of new-style farm tools mainly relies on local industries, and there are many such factories and they are very scattered, so many difficulties will occur in the actual work process. If we deviate from specific and regular leadership, we may not achieve the desired results, and there is a danger of it becoming a mere formality. The attitude of leaders should not be to allow the competition to develop spontaneously, but should be to help the masses create favorable conditions in all aspects; they should not sit and wait for the evaluation results, but should regularly and carefully check the work, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner.

    The high tide of agricultural cooperation has arrived, and the workers in the farm tool manufacturing industry are already standing at the forefront of the struggle. Let us further help them organize, carry out creative labor, complete next year's tasks, produce more farm tools and machines of good quality and low price, vigorously support the agricultural cooperation movement, accelerate the speed of the great socialist construction cause, and achieve greater victories!

    更多地制造质量好、价格低的新农具
    我国广大农村中的农业合作化运动，正以空前的速度向前发展。这就直接向工业方面提出了一项迫切的任务：必须适应目前农业发展的需要，供应足够数量的、物美价廉的新式农具和农业机器。
    最近召开的全国农具制造工作者会议确定了一九五六年的农具生产任务。双轮双（单）铧犁的产量要达到二百三十六万部，比今年增加三倍还多；播种机、收割机等主要农具产量也要增加一倍到三倍；地方国营机械工业还要制造六十二种共一千四百七十多万件新式畜力农具、改良农具和农产品加工工具。会议要求所有农具都要质量好、成本低，并且必须按照图纸和技术标准进行生产，大力降低废品率，要把双轮双（单）铧犁、播种机等十一种产品的生产成本较今年分别降低百分之二十到四十五。这是当前农具制造业的一项光荣任务。
    几年来，农具生产逐年供应了农村的需要，有助于农业生产水平的提高。但是，就当前农具生产的情况看来，要完成明年农具生产的任务还有许多困难。过去缺乏全面规划，劳动组织有很多不合理的现象，许多技术问题解决得不好，保守思想相当严重，因而废品率高，产品价格贵，而且品种少，质量不好。国营灵山农具厂制造犁铧的返修率高达百分之二十，许多地方国营工厂、公私合营工厂的情形更严重。加上目前又是大量增产，有许多产品是过去很少或者没有生产过的，问题当然不会少。
    但是，经过这次全国农具会议，农具生产有了全面规划，只要有步骤地组织生产，提高劳动生产效率，全面加强技术工作，大力改进工艺规程，改进生产工具，推广先进操作方法，加强检验工作来保证产品质量的提高和成本的降低，加强成本管理和新产品的试制工作，企业管理水平和生产能力就可以不断提高。
    农具制造企业中蕴藏有很大的潜力可以挖掘。例如目前制造中型双铧犁，单位产品的劳动量有的是八小时，有的要十七、八小时；单位产品成本有的是七十六元，有的要一百零五元；有的工厂制造每台中型双铧犁的工时比普通的高五小时，但铸件的造型工时却可以比普通的减少一半时间。这种不平衡的现象，充分说明了农具制造企业中有很大的潜在能力。
    现在直接生产农业工具的工厂职工，为了支援农业合作化运动，已经积极行动起来，创造了优异的成绩。北京农业机械厂双轮双铧犁车间在十月下旬出现了二十项生产上的新纪录；湖北省农具厂十一月份每部双铧犁的成本就比原订计划降低了十元一角三分；开封机械厂装配车间工人经过改进工具、调整劳动组织，已由每天装二百二十部提高到三百部；石家庄动力机械厂青年工人刘汗意改进了磨光铧头的操作方法，由每天磨七十个提高到三百二十个。最近北京农业机械厂倡议发起支援农业合作化的厂际劳动竞赛，得到全国许多工厂的响应以后，农具制造业广大职工劳动竞赛的热情已经达到了高潮。
    北京农业机械厂提出倡议以后，在十二月头五天内又出现了二十八项新纪录；沈阳暖气器材厂在十二月四日通过响应倡议的决议以后，工人邢奎仕做农具二○二部件的废品率就由百分之二十下降到百分之零点三七；山西省机器厂工人夏建章做地轮轴由定额七十五件提高到二百二十件。仅仅在十天之内，各厂工时消耗不断减少，产品成本一再降低，先进经验不断地被创造出来。这些都大大地鼓舞了人们完成计划的信心。
    目前已有四十多个农具和机械工厂参加了支援农业合作化的厂际竞赛。参加竞赛的每一个企业应当注意，不仅要完成产品的数量，而且要特别保证产品的质量，要使每一件发到农民手中的农具都结实耐用，都适合当地农民的需要。在竞赛中必须防止可能发生的因为突击数量而降低质量的现象。必须经常教育企业中所有的工人、技术人员、管理人员，使他们懂得，只有制造出坚固、方便、耐用的农具，才能真正达到提高农业生产、推进农业合作化的目的，才能为进一步推广新式农具和农业机器打下基础。因此，一切农具制造业的工人、技术人员、管理人员，必须全面地把数量多、质量好、价格低作为竞赛的目标。
    组织所有农具制造业的职工完成明年的农具生产任务，对于农业合作化是一个最大的支持。厂际劳动竞赛的开展，无疑地将要起极大的组织作用。各地方和有关企业的党委和政府工业部门，必须把这项工作列入农业合作化工作的全面规划之内，积极加强领导。新式农具的生产，主要靠地方工业，而这类工厂为数很多，又非常分散，在实际工作过程中是会发生许多困难的。如果离开具体、经常的领导，就可能收不到应有的效果，而且有流于形式的危险。领导者的态度不应该听任竞赛自发地开展，而应该从各方面帮助群众创造有利条件；不应该坐待评比成绩，而应该经常、认真地检查工作，发现问题，并且及时加以解决。
    农业合作化高潮已经到来，农具制造业的职工已经站在斗争的最前列。让我们进一步帮助他们组织起来，进行创造性的劳动，完成明年任务，更多地制造出质量好、价格低的农具和机器，大力支持农业合作化运动，使伟大的社会主义建设事业速度加快，取得更大胜利！
