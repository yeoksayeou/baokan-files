    The National Agricultural Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture was held in Beijing from December 12th to 23rd. The conference determined the agricultural production tasks for 1956. The tasks stipulated that agricultural production in 1956 should reach the production targets originally set for 1957 in the First Five-Year Plan. The conference also discussed long-term plans for agricultural production during the Second and Third Five-Year Plans.

    Based on the new situation brought about by the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the conference proposed that the total national grain output for next year should reach 398 billion jin, exceeding the original planned target for 1957 by 12.4 billion jin; the goal to strive for is to exceed 400 billion jin. The total national cotton output for next year should reach 35.5 million dan (lint cotton, same below), exceeding the planned target for 1957 by 2.75 million dan. The total national flue-cured tobacco output for next year should exceed the planned target for 1957 by 270,000 dan. The total output of tea and tussah silkworm cocoons should also reach the 1957 production targets. Other industrial crops and livestock should be actively developed. The conference also made comprehensive plans for the growth requirements of various agricultural products and large and small livestock by 1962 and 1967.

    The conference believes that there are ample conditions to achieve such huge agricultural production tasks next year. According to the current development trend of the national agricultural cooperativization movement, it is expected that semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization will be realized nationwide next year, which will unleash enormous potential for increased production. Strengthening the leadership of agricultural production by Party organizations at all levels is a reliable guarantee for the successful completion of the above-mentioned production increase tasks. In addition, the state's support for agricultural production in economic and other aspects is also a favorable condition for ensuring the completion of agricultural production increase tasks.

    In order to complete the agricultural production increase tasks for next year and in the future, the conference required all localities to formulate effective production increase measures in light of local conditions. It is necessary to reclaim wasteland in a planned manner to expand cultivated land area; increase multiple cropping area and plant more high-yield crops; promote new-style agricultural tools and gradually implement mechanization; build small-scale water conservancy projects to expand irrigation area; develop fertilizer sources and improve fertilization techniques; improve seeds; improve soil; improve cultivation systems and cultivation techniques; and prevent and control disasters such as diseases, insects, birds, and animals. The conference specifically proposed that within seven years, general water and drought disasters should be eliminated nationwide, major crops should be universally planted with improved varieties, and the ten major crop diseases and insect pests such as locusts, armyworms, aphids, borers (rice stem borers, corn borers), spider mites, pink bollworms, mole crickets, wheat smut, wheat nematode disease, and sweet potato black rot, as well as animal epidemics such as rinderpest and hog cholera, should be basically eliminated. At the same time, birds and animals such as sparrows and field mice that harm crops should also be basically eliminated. The conference also required agricultural departments at all levels, down to the agricultural production cooperatives, to make comprehensive plans centered on the development of agricultural production; required agricultural departments at all levels to vigorously train cadres for agricultural production cooperatives and help agricultural production cooperatives do a good job in business management and financial accounting; do a good job in launching agricultural production competitions, rewarding labor models, organizing visits, and holding agricultural exhibitions. The conference also called for strengthening agricultural scientific research and required all localities to seize the opportunity to prepare for agricultural production next year.

    The conference also discussed issues such as improving the work of state-owned mechanized farms and state-owned ranches, developing state-owned mechanized farms and state-owned ranches, developing mountain production, and helping ethnic minority areas develop agricultural production.

    The conference analyzed and criticized the right-leaning conservative tendencies in leading agricultural production in the past, and required all localities to further overcome them and improve their work style to ensure the realization of agricultural production increase targets.

    The conference was attended by the heads of agricultural departments, animal husbandry departments, and agricultural and forestry water conservancy bureaus of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, the chairmen of four agricultural production cooperatives in Beijing, Hebei and other provinces and cities, and representatives from relevant central departments.

    全国农业工作会议提出明年农业生产任务
    粮棉产量超过一九五七年指标
    本报讯　农业部召开的全国农业工作会议十二月十二日到二十三日在北京举行。会议确定了一九五六年的农业生产任务。任务规定，一九五六年的农业生产要达到第一个五年计划原定一九五七年的生产指标。会议还讨论了第二和第三个五年计划期间农业生产的远景规划。
    会议根据农业合作化高潮到来的新形势，提出明年全国粮食总产量要达到三千九百八十亿斤，超过原定一九五七年的计划指标一百二十四亿斤；努力争取的目标是超过四千亿斤。明年棉花总产量要达到三千五百五十万担（皮棉，下同），超过一九五七年的计划指标二百七十五万担。明年烤烟总产量要超过一九五七年的计划指标二十七万担。茶叶和柞蚕茧的总产量也要达到一九五七年的生产指标。其他技术作物和牲畜都要积极发展。对于到一九六二年和到一九六七年各种农产品和大、小家畜的增长要求，会议也作了全面的规划。
    会议认为，实现明年这样巨大的农业生产任务，是具备有充分的条件的。根据目前全国农业合作化运动发展的形势，预计明年全国即可实现半社会主义性质的农业合作化，这将能发挥巨大的增产潜力。各级党组织加强农业生产领导，是胜利完成上述增产任务的可靠保证。另外，国家在经济等方面对农业生产的支援，也是保证完成农业增产任务的有利条件。
    为了完成明年和今后的农业增产任务，会议要求各地因地制宜地制定有效的增产措施。要有计划地开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积；增加复种面积，多种高产作物；推广新式农具，逐步实行机械化；兴修小型水利，扩大灌溉面积；开辟肥源，改进施肥技术；改良种籽；改良土壤；改进耕作制度和栽培技术；防治病、虫、鸟、兽等灾害。会议具体提出，七年内，要在全国范围内消灭一般水旱灾害，做到主要作物普遍使用良种，并且基本上消灭蝗虫、粘虫、蚜虫、钻心虫（稻螟、玉米螟）、红蜘蛛、红铃虫、蝼蛄、黑穗病、小麦线虫病、甘薯黑斑病等十大主要的农作物病虫害和牛瘟、猪瘟等兽疫，同时还要基本上消灭为害农作物的麻雀、田鼠等鸟兽。会议还要求各级农业部门一直到农业生产合作社，都要作出以发展农业生产为中心内容的全面规划；要求各级农业部门大力为农业生产合作社训练干部，帮助农业生产合作社搞好经营管理和财务会计工作；做好发动农业生产竞赛、奖励劳动模范、组织参观、举办农业展览会等工作。会议还要求加强农业科学研究工作，并要求各地抓紧时机，做好明年农业生产的准备。
    对于改进国营机械农场和国营牧场的工作，发展国营机械农场和国营牧场，发展山区生产，帮助少数民族地区发展农业生产等问题，这次会议也进行了讨论。
    会议对过去在领导农业生产上的右倾保守主义倾向作了分析批判，要求各地进一步加以克服，并且改进工作作风，以保证农业增产指标的实现。
    参加这次会议的有各省、自治区、市的农业厅、畜牧厅、农林水利局等的负责人，北京、河北等省、市的四个农业生产合作社的社长，以及中央各有关部门的代表。
