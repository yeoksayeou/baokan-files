This year, the nation's industrial and mining enterprises can save up to 300 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.

This year, dozens of factories, mines, and enterprises in eight industries, including coal mining and steel, have conducted pilot programs for saving electricity. These enterprises have combined electricity conservation with improvements in production, resulting in a significant reduction in the unit electricity consumption of their products. Fushun Coal Mine, by increasing the efficiency of its water pumps and winches, reduced electricity consumption per ton of coal by three kilowatt-hours compared to last year; Nanjing Jiangnan Cement Plant improved operations and increased mill output, saving 5.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity throughout the year. In the third quarter, the electricity consumption of products at the state-owned Shixian Paper Mill had already decreased by 10% compared to the same period last year.

To accurately calculate electricity usage, many enterprises have also strengthened the measurement of machine electricity consumption this year.

This year, many coal mines and machinery factories have dismantled excess transformer capacity and adjusted the size of electric motors, which has also played a significant role in saving electricity. (Xu Guotang)

    今年全国工矿企业节约电力可达三亿度
    今年全国工矿企业节约的电力将可以达到三亿度。
    今年，全国煤矿、钢铁等八个产业有几十个厂矿、企业进行了节约电力的试点工作。这些企业把节约电力和改进生产工作结合起来，使产品的单位电耗有了显著降低。抚顺煤矿由于提高了水泵效率和绞车效率，使每吨煤的耗电量比去年减少了三度；南京江南水泥厂改进了操作，提高了磨机产量，全年节约电力五百四十万度。国营石岘纸厂第三季度产品的耗电量，已经比去年同一时期下降了百分之十。
    为了精确计算电力的使用情况，许多企业今年还加强了对机器耗电情况的测定工作。
    今年不少煤矿、机械厂拆除了多余的变压器容量，调整了电动机的大小，也对节约电力起了很大的作用。　（徐国汤）
