Xinhua News Agency, Amman, December 20th: King Hussein of Jordan ordered the dissolution of the Jordanian parliament on the 19th. The government headed by Magali, which had been established only a few days earlier, also resigned on the same day. The dissolution of the parliament was requested by Magali to the King. Elections for the new parliament will be held within four months.

The Magali government was formed after British Imperial Chief of Staff Templer's recent activities in Jordan. Since the Magali government advocated Jordan's accession to the Baghdad Pact, mass demonstrations have taken place throughout Jordan since its establishment, expressing opposition to Jordan's accession to the Baghdad Pact. According to a report by "Daily Express" reporter Moffett, the commander of the Jordanian Arab Legion, British General Glubb, personally led troops in brutally suppressing the demonstrating masses.

On the 19th, the Jordanian people continued to hold demonstrations, and the situation remained tense. A general strike was declared in Amman, and a mass meeting was held next to the Jordanian government building in the city. Speakers called on the people to continue the struggle against the Baghdad Pact. In the Jordanian part of Jerusalem, dozens of demonstrators were killed and wounded by government troops.

The British attempt to force Jordan to join the Baghdad Pact has also been opposed by the public and public opinion in Middle Eastern countries. In Damascus, the Syrian people held a large-scale demonstration on the 18th to protest the new Jordanian government's plan to join the Baghdad Pact, which is opposed by all Jordanians. Demonstrators chanted slogans and held placards with slogans such as: "Down with the aggressive Baghdad Pact!" "Stop the imperialists from putting pressure on Jordan!" "Imperialists get out of Arab countries!" and other slogans.

The Syrian parliament on the 17th asked the government to find ways to prevent Jordan from joining the Baghdad Pact, so that Jordan would be "spared from falling into the clutches of Western colonial treaties."

An official spokesman for the Egyptian government recently stated that some people want to drag Jordan into the Baghdad Pact. He said that the policy of establishing blocs is destructive to peace.

    约旦人民继续示威反对加入巴格达条约
    新华社二十日讯　安曼消息：约旦国王侯赛尼在十九日下令解散了约旦议会。刚成立几天的以马加利为首的政府也在同一天辞职。解散议会的行动是马加利要求国王采取的。新议会的选举将在四个月内举行。
    马加利政府是在英帝国参谋总长田普勒最近到约旦活动后成立的。由于马加利政府主张约旦加入巴格达条约，自从它成立以来，约旦全国各地就连续发生了群众示威，表示反对约旦加入巴格达条约。据英国“每日快报”记者摩菲特报道，约旦的阿拉伯军团司令官、英国将军格鲁布亲自领导着军队对示威群众进行残酷镇压。
    十九日，约旦人民继续举行示威，情况仍然很紧张。在安曼宣布了总罢工，市内约旦政府大厦旁举行了群众大会，讲演者们在发言中号召人民为反对巴格达条约而继续斗争。耶路撒冷的约旦区的示威群众被政府军队打死打伤了几十人。
    英国企图迫使约旦加入巴格达条约的阴谋也遭到中东各国公众和舆论的反对。在大马士革，叙利亚人民在十八日举行了一次大规模的示威游行，抗议约旦新政府要加入为全约旦人民反对的巴格达条约的打算。示威者高喊口号，手上拿着标语牌，上面写着：“打倒侵略性的巴格达条约！”“制止英帝国主义者对约旦施加压力！”“帝国主义者滚出阿拉伯国家！”等口号。
    叙利亚议会十七日曾要求政府设法阻止约旦加入巴格达条约，以使约旦“免于落入西方殖民条约的魔爪”。
    埃及政府的一个官方发言人最近发表谈话时指出，有人想把约旦拖进巴格达条约。他说，建立集团的政策是破坏和平的。
