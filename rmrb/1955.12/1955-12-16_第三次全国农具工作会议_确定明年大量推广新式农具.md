Xinhua News Agency, 15th. Concurrent with the Ministry of Third Machine Industry's convening of a national agricultural implement special conference to discuss the large-scale manufacture of new-style farm tools, the Ministry of Agriculture, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives jointly convened the Third National Agricultural Implement Work Conference from November 25th to December 11th, to discuss issues related to the large-scale promotion of new-style farm tools.

Based on the current urgent need of agricultural production cooperatives for new-style farm tools and the production situation of new-style farm tools, the conference tentatively planned to promote 1.8 million double-wheeled double-share (or single-share) plows nationwide next year (with 2.36 million planned for manufacture next year, some of which will be delivered later and promoted in 1957), 70,000 disk harrows and spike-tooth harrows, 111,000 seeders, harvesters, and portable steam engines, and 1,012,000 hillside plows, paddy field plows, and walking plows.

The promotion work includes three important aspects: timely allocation and supply, teaching farmers how to use them, and repairing them. The conference believed that not only agricultural cadres and cadres of agricultural technology extension stations should learn how to use and repair new-style farm tools in order to teach farmers, but also the cadres of supply and marketing cooperative grassroots branches who manage new-style farm tools should learn, so that they can supply and impart technology at the same time. In addition, some rural educated youth can be trained as teachers to impart knowledge, and the broad masses of farmers should be mobilized to teach and learn from each other. Next year, the country plans to train more than 300,000 agricultural implement cadres and more than 8 million agricultural implement operators (farmers). The conference pointed out that supply and marketing cooperatives should greatly strengthen the supply of new-style farm tools, focus on allocating the sources of goods for the first quarter of next year, and immediately rectify and adjust any new-style farm tools that are idle due to improper allocation. At the same time, efforts should be made to reduce operating links, eliminate all roundabout transportation, and reduce circulation costs. During the promotion, exhibitions, visits, and demonstration performances can be organized. Local handicraft production cooperatives should organize the repair of new-style farm tools and the preparation of parts for farmers. Next year, the country plans to establish 2,000 county-level central repair stations and 16,000 district-level grassroots repair stations.

This conference focused on criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking of the past, where promotion plans were too low, and required all localities to comprehensively plan the promotion work, strengthen leadership, clarify the division of labor of relevant departments, further cooperate closely, and vigorously promote various new-style farm tools and improved farm tools to meet the needs of the development of the agricultural cooperation movement.

    第三次全国农具工作会议
    确定明年大量推广新式农具
    新华社十五日讯　在第三机械工业部召开全国农具专业会议讨论大量制造新式农具问题的同时，农业部、全国供销合作总社和全国手工业生产合作社联合总社筹备委员会也在十一月二十五日到十二月十一日联合召开了第三次全国农具工作会议，讨论了有关大量推广新式农具的问题。
    根据当前农业生产合作社迫切需要新式农具的情况和新式农具生产的情况，会议初步计划明年在全国推广双轮双铧（或单铧）犁一百八十万部（明年计划制造二百三十六万部，其中一部分出厂较迟，一九五七年才能推广），圆盘耙和钉齿耙七万部，播种机、收割机和锅驼机十一万一千部，山地犁、水田犁和步犁一百零一万二千部。
    推广工作包括及时调配供应、教会农民使用和修理这三个重要环节。会议认为，不仅农业干部和农业技术推广站的干部应该学会使用、修理新式农具，以便向农民传授；就是供销合作社基层社经营新式农具的干部也要学会，以便一面供应，一面传授技术。此外还可以训练一些农村知识青年作为传授的师资，并且发动广大农民互教互学。明年，全国计划训练各种农具干部三十多万人，农具手（农民）八百多万人。会议指出，供销合作社要大大加强新式农具的供应工作，有重点地分配明年第一季度的货源，对因为调拨不当而闲置未用的新式农具，要立即抽闲补空，坚决加以调整；同时，要力求减少经营环节，消灭一切迂回运输，降低流转费用。推广的时候可以结合组织展览参观和表演示范。各地手工业生产合作社要组织好为农民修理新式农具和配制零件的工作。明年全国计划建立县的中心修配站二千处和区的基层修配站一万六千处。
    这次会议着重批判了过去推广计划偏低的右倾保守思想，要求各地对推广工作全面规划，加强领导，明确有关部门的分工，进一步通力协作，大力推广各种新式农具和改良农具，以适应农业合作化运动发展的需要。
