Lanzhou, December 20th (Report from this newspaper) - The additional 108-kilometer track-laying project on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway for this year was completed on the 19th. That afternoon, the track-laying team laid the rails to the end point of the 108-kilometer section - 2.45 kilometers west of Xusanwan. Currently, earthwork and bridge/culvert construction on the roadbed west of the 108-kilometer section are proceeding intensely. Workers are striving to lay another 30 kilometers of track for the country before the end of the year, reaching Qingshui.

After the state proposed the task of adding 108 kilometers of track-laying to the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway this year, the vast number of employees showed great enthusiasm for labor. They overcame many difficulties in winter construction and completed the task ahead of schedule despite insufficient labor, machinery, and tools. The youth shock brigade of the 14th Engineering Area, responsible for building the roadbed earthwork in the Gaotai overflow area, increased its work rate from an average of 5.8 cubic meters per person per day to 6.7 cubic meters, with a maximum of 8.25 cubic meters. The Lintan Cement Branch broke through the quota in every process from mold erection to loading and unloading from the factory, supplying the required large and small water pipes for the newly added lines ahead of schedule.

This newspaper reports - The preliminary survey and construction data design for the main line of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway were completed ahead of schedule at the end of November. The surveying, exploration, and design personnel responsible for this main line, in order to choose the most economically reasonable route, had been traveling throughout the high mountains, steep ridges, rivers, and valleys along the line since 1953. They finally completed the preliminary survey and initial survey of the entire line by the end of September last year, and then immediately began the final survey of the entire line. Because the exploration and design personnel adopted the advanced experience of on-site design, delivering design documents on-site while conducting the exploration, the construction data design work was also able to be completed entirely after the final survey task of the entire line was basically completed.

    兰新铁路今年追加的铺轨工程提前完工
    鹰厦铁路正线的定测和施工资料设计工作完成
    本报兰州二十日电　兰新铁路今年追加的一百零八公里铺轨工程在十九日完工。这天下午，钉道队把铁轨铺到了一百零八公里的终点——许三湾以西二点四五公里的地方。现在一百零八公里以西的路基土石方工程和桥涵工程正在紧张施工，职工们争取在年底以前再为国家铺轨三十公里，到达清水。
    在国家提出兰新铁路今年追加一百零八公里铺轨工程任务以后，广大职工劳动热情非常高涨。他们克服了冬季施工中的许多困难，在劳动力、机械、工具不足的条件下，仍提前完成了任务。负责在高台漫流地区修建路基土方的十四工区青年突击队，工率由平均每人每天五点八方，提高到六点七方，最高达到八点二五方。临潭水泥分厂从立模到装吊出厂的每道工序都突破了定额，提早供应了新增线路所需要的大小水管。
    本报讯　鹰厦铁路正线的定测和施工资料设计工作已经于十一月底提前完成。负责这条正线工作的测量、勘测、设计人员，为了选择一条经济上最合理的线路，从一九五三年开始，踏遍了沿线的高山峻岭和河流山谷，终于在去年九月底完成了全线的草测和初测，紧接着，又开始了全线的定测工作。由于勘测设计人员们采用了现场设计的先进经验，边勘测边在现场交付设计文件，因而在全线定测任务基本结束后，施工资料设计工作也能够全部完成。
