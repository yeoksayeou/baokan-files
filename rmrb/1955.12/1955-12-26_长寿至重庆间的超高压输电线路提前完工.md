    Extra-High Voltage Transmission Line Between Changshou and Chongqing Completed Ahead of Schedule
    The extra-high voltage transmission line project between Changshou and Chongqing in Sichuan Province was fully completed on December 23, ahead of schedule. After the Shizitan Hydropower Station is completed, this line will connect the Chongqing power system with the Changshou power system, increasing the public power capacity in the Chongqing area by more than double the current level, in order to meet the needs of Chongqing's industrial development.
    This extra-high voltage transmission line is one of the key construction projects in the power industry of China's First Five-Year Plan. During construction, the workers overcame various transportation difficulties presented by steep cliffs and mountainous terrain, devising many simple transportation methods to ensure that various construction materials were delivered to the construction site on time, ensuring the progress of the project and saving the country more than 240,000 yuan in transportation costs. The entire project saved more than 40% of the originally planned investment. (Report from our correspondent in Chengdu)

    长寿至重庆间的超高压输电线路提前完工
    四川省长寿至重庆间架设的超高压输电线路工程，在十二月二十三日提前全部完工。这条线路在狮子滩水电站建成后，将把重庆电力系统和长寿电力系统联接起来，使重庆地区公用电力容量比目前增加一倍以上，以适应重庆工业发展的需要。
    这条超高压输电线路是我国第一个五年计划中的电力工业基本建设重点工程之一。在建筑中，工人们克服了悬岩陡壁和山地的各种运输困难，想出许多简便运输方法，使各种建设器材按时运到工地，保证了工程进度，为国家节约的运费就有二十四万多元。整个工程比原计划节约投资百分之四十多。　（本报驻成都记者）
