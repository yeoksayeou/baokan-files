Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, December 16th: The Chinese Commodity Exhibition held in Osaka successfully concluded on December 15th. During the fifteen-day exhibition period, the number of visitors reached over 1.23 million.

That evening, the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation held a grand reception inside the exhibition hall. Invited to attend the reception were Mr. Shozo Murata, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association; Mr. Hozumi Shichiro, representative of the League of Diet Members for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade; Mr. Michitaka Omori, Vice Governor of Osaka Prefecture; Mr. Keiichi Umemoto, Speaker of the Osaka Prefectural Assembly; Mr. Teiichiro Matsuo, Speaker of the Osaka City Council, and others.

Also attending the reception were representatives of various mass organizations, mayors and city council speakers from many cities in Kansai, industrialists and businessmen, university professors, representatives of Korean residents, and representatives of overseas Chinese, totaling more than 1,500 people.

Mr. Cao Zhongshu, head of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation, said amidst warm applause: The great success of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition in Osaka demonstrates the concern of all sectors of Osaka for China and their urgent demand for Sino-Japanese trade. He said that the Chinese Commodity Exhibition has enabled friends from all walks of life in Japan to have a better understanding of New China. At the same time, we deeply feel that the Japanese nation is hardworking, brave, and intelligent, and loves peace. Almost all Japanese friends from all walks of life who have come into contact with us hope that China and Japan will establish diplomatic relations soon in order to carry out economic cooperation and cultural exchanges. They expressed their deep resentment towards the damage caused to the Japanese economy by the "embargo" from abroad. Cao Zhongshu pointed out that if China and Japan join hands, it will not only benefit each other but also make a great contribution to Asia. The Chinese government and people have always advocated the establishment of normal diplomatic relations and the strengthening of economic and cultural exchanges with our neighbor, Japan, and have made many efforts in this regard over the past few years. This exhibition has undoubtedly enhanced our friendship and created conditions for further development of trade between China and Japan. We hope that the Japanese commodity exhibition to be held in China next year will also be a great success.

Mr. Shozo Murata said in his speech: "The Chinese exhibition in Osaka has achieved unprecedented success. This exhibition is not just a display of goods, it has great significance for the future of the two countries." He said: "The Japanese people have expressed their enthusiasm to shake hands with their neighbor China."

Mr. Hozumi Shichiro, representative of the League of Diet Members for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, said: "We will use the achievements of this commodity exhibition and the efforts of the Japanese people to promote the realization of the payment agreement and the establishment of commercial representative offices stipulated in the Third Trade Agreement." He pointed out: "It is unnatural that diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not been restored and there is no trade agreement between the governments. Continuing in this way is detrimental to Japan."

Mr. Fusazo Inaba, Chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Trade Committee, the Speaker of the Osaka Prefectural Assembly, and the Speaker of the Osaka City Council also spoke at the meeting.

The reception concluded with the participants and members of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation joining hands and singing "Tokyo-Beijing" and shouting "Long live Sino-Japanese friendship!" (Attached photo)

    大阪中国商品展览会胜利闭幕
    十五天中观众达一百二十三万多人
    据新华社大阪十六日电  在大阪举行的中国商品展览会已经在十二月十五日胜利闭幕。在十五天的展期中，观众达到一百二十三万多人。
    这一天的晚间，中国商品展览团在展览馆内举行了盛大的酒会。应邀参加酒会的有日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏，日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表穗积七郎，大阪府副知事大森通孝，大阪府议会议长梅本敬一，大阪市议会议长松尾祯一郎等。
    参加酒会的还有各群众团体的代表，关西许多城市的市长、市议会议长、工商业者、大学教授、朝鲜侨民和华侨代表等共一千五百多人。
    中国商品展览团团长曹中枢在热烈的掌声中致词说：中国商品展览会在大阪所获得的更大的成功表现了大阪各界人士对中国的关心和对中日贸易的迫切要求。他说，中国商品展览会使日本各界朋友们对新中国有了进一步的了解。同时，我们深刻体会到日本民族是勤劳、勇敢而富于智慧的，并且是热爱和平的。几乎所有与我们接触过的日本各界朋友们都希望中日两国很快地建立邦交，以便开展经济合作和文化交流。他们对于外来的“禁运”给日本经济的损害表示了深恶痛绝的态度。曹中枢指出，中国如果和日本携起手来，不仅彼此有利而且对亚洲的贡献也将是很大的。中国政府和人民一向主张同我们的邻邦日本建立正常的外交关系和加强经济文化交流，并且在几年来曾经作了不少的努力。这一次的展览会无疑地增进了我们的友谊，创造了进一步开展中日两国贸易的条件。我们希望明年日本在中国举办的商品展览会同样能得到很大的成功。
    村田省藏致词说：“大阪的中国展览会获得空前的成功。这个展览会并不只是商品的展出，它对两国的将来有重大的意义。”他说：“日本国民表示了非和邻邦中国握手不可的热情。”
    日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表穗积七郎致词说：“我们将以这次商品展览会的成就和日本国民的努力来促使第三次贸易协定中规定的缔结支付协定和设置商务代表机构能够实现。”他指出：“中日邦交尚未恢复，政府间也没有贸易协定，这是不自然的，这样继续下去，对日本是不利的。”
    大阪府贸易委员长稻叶房藏、大阪府议会议长和市议会议长也在会上讲了话。
    酒会最后在与会者和中国商品展览团团员们手挽手合唱“东京—北京”的歌声中和高喊“中日两国友好万岁”的口号声中结束。（附图片）
    在日本大阪举行的中国商品展览会自十一月三十日开幕以来，日本各界人民踊跃前往参观。这是参观的人群进入展览馆的情形。
