To the Editor:

    At the end of October, a member of an agricultural production cooperative in Nan Hongmen Township, Daxing County, came to our factory with a broken plow bracket from a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow, asking for repairs. He said, agitatedly, "I've traveled one or two hundred *li* just to fix this little thing. You must solve this for us, no matter what." I asked him, "Why didn't you go to the district supply and marketing cooperative for repairs?" He replied, "Don't even mention it! I went to the district cooperative, the county cooperative, and the farm implement station, but they all sent me here." So, we repaired it for him.

    A day or two later, Liu Changshan from the First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beidian Village, Huangtu Township, Changping County, and Liu Jingren from the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tanzhao Township, Yanjiao District, Sanhe County, came to our factory, asking to repair damaged farm implement parts. At that time, staff from the Hebei Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Tongxian Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative were at our factory to order farm implements. I raised my concerns with them: According to the instructions from higher authorities, the supply and marketing cooperative should be responsible for supplying spare parts and repairing small farm implements, and farmers shouldn't have to run around like this.

    However, they did not accept this suggestion. On November 7, Tian Binglin from the Fengshou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengjiabu Township and Qi Fuhuai from the Zaisheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaotun Township, both from Sanhe County, came to our factory to exchange farm implement parts. They had been traveling for three or four days to repair their farm implements. Old Qi said anxiously, "Our cooperative has four double-wheeled, double-furrow plows. Each plow can cultivate more than 30 *mu* of land day and night. Now that it's almost freezing, we use them in three shifts, day and night, with the plow never resting. But one of them is broken, and we can't find the parts anywhere, which is delaying production. Why does the supply and marketing cooperative only sell plows and not repair the spare parts?"

    The Hebei Province and Tongxian Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperatives should inspect their work.

### 为什么供销合作社不负责修配农具的零件

    为什么供销合作社不负责修配农具的零件编辑同志：
    十月末，大兴县南红门乡农业生产合作社的一个社员，拿着一个坏了的双轮双铧犁的犁托，跑到我们工厂要求修理。他气咻咻地说：“为了修理这点玩艺，我足足跑了一、二百里地。这下子你们无论如何要给我们解决。”我问他：“为什么不就近找区供销社修配呢？”他回答说：“别提了！我找过区社、县社和农具站，结果还是支使我上这儿来。”于是，我们就给他修理了。
    隔了一、两天，又有昌平县黄土乡北店村第一农业生产合作社的刘长山和三河县燕郊区谭召乡红光农业生产合作社的刘景仁等人找到我们工厂，要求修理损坏了的农具零件。这时候，恰好河北省供销合作社和通县专区供销合作社的工作人员到我们厂订购农具。我就向他们提了意见：按照上级的规定，供销合作社应该负责供应配件和修配零星农具，不能让农民这样到处奔跑。
    可是他们并没有接受这个意见。十一月七日，三河县又有冯家埠乡丰收农业生产合作社的田炳林和小屯乡再生农业生产合作社的齐福怀两人到我们工厂来换农具零件。他们为了修配农具，已经奔走了三、四天。老齐着急地说：“我们社共有四台双轮双铧犁，每部犁一昼夜能耕三十多亩地，现在眼看就要上冻了，所以我们都是昼夜三班轮换使用它，歇人不歇犁。可是这一台坏了，到处配不上零件，耽误了生产。为什么供销社只管卖犁就不管修配零件呢？”
    河北省和通县专区供销合作社应该检查一下工作。
