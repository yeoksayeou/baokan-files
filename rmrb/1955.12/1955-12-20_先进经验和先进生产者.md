    Advanced Experience and Advanced Producers
    Electric Spark Hardening of Cutting Tools
    Wang Zhangzhen, Dong Xingmao
    Electric spark hardening of cutting tools involves applying a layer of hard alloy to the cutting edge of tools, extending their service life, reducing the auxiliary time spent on sharpening and mounting, and improving cutting efficiency. This is of great significance for increasing the processing efficiency of mechanical manufacturing, saving tools, and reducing costs. Electric spark hardening has a wide range of applications, including tools such as lathe tools, milling cutters, drill bits, reamers, etc., and can also be used for dies, saw blades, and other aspects.
    Currently, twenty-five factories, including Shanghai Machine Tool Plant and Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, have learned and promoted this experience and achieved great results. For example, after the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant promoted it on lathe tools, parting tools, milling cutters, planer tools, and other tools, the service life of the tools increased by one to three times, and the efficiency of milling turbine generator rotors increased by twelve times. This plant has decided to increase equipment again to promote the advanced experience of electric spark hardening on all tools in the workshop. The state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Plant has promoted it on twenty-eight machine tools, with a wide range of applications, including lathe tools, planer tools, milling cutters, drill bits, hobbing cutters, boring tools, template tools, reamers, punching dies, etc., accounting for more than 70% of steel cutting tools, resulting in an increase in tool life of one to five times. They also continue to use discarded reamers after hardening them. When the oil pump workshop of Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant was boring the oil pump casing, it increased efficiency by three times, solving key problems in production.

    刀具的电火花强化
    汪张镇　董兴茂
    刀具的电火花强化，就是在切削刀具刃口上涂上一层硬质合金，使刀具使用寿命延长，减少磨刀、装刀的辅助时间，提高切削效率。这对提高机械制造的加工效率、节约刀具、降低成本都具有重要意义。电火花强化的用途很广，可用于车刀、铣刀、钻头、铰刀等等工具，还可用于冲模、锯条等方面。
    现在，上海机床厂、上海电机厂等二十五个工厂都学习和推广了这一经验，并且获得了很大成绩。如上海电机厂在车刀、割刀、铣刀、刨刀等刀具上推广后，刀具使用寿命提高一倍到三倍，铣切汽轮发电机转子的时候，效率提高了十二倍。这个厂已决定再增加设备，在车间全部刀具上推广电火花强化先进经验。国营上海第二纺织机械厂已在二十八台机床上推广，使用的面很广，有车刀、刨刀、铣刀、钻头、滚刀、搪刀、样板刀、铰刀、冲模等，占生钢刀具百分之七十以上，结果提高刀具使用寿命一倍到五倍。他们还把已经报废的铰刀强化后继续使用。上海柴油机厂油泵车间铰油泵外壳的时候，提高效率三倍，解决了生产中的关键问题。
