Xinhua News Agency, New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee concluded its discussion on disarmament issues and "measures to further ease international tensions and develop international cooperation" on December 12.

    At the seventh meeting, Soviet representative Kuznetsov accused Western countries of currently attempting to covertly divert attention from discussions on stopping the arms race, reducing armaments, and prohibiting atomic weapons by talking loudly about collecting intelligence and investigating armed forces and armaments. Kuznetsov supported the Indian delegation's proposal to halt the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    Syrian representative Shukairy also spoke during the discussion, righteously criticizing Western countries' attempts to shift the responsibility for tensions in the Near East situation onto the Soviet Union. Shukairy said that the Near East situation is one of the reasons for international tensions, but the Near East tension was neither created nor exacerbated by the Soviet Union. The fact is that the turmoil in the Near East was created by the West. He said, "The Soviet Union does not have a military base in the Middle East, and the Soviet Union has not offended a single citizen in the Middle East... It is not the Soviet Union suppressing the liberation movement in North Africa. It is not the Soviet Union that created the great tragedy of the Palestine issue. It is not the Soviet Union that bombed the southern territory of Yemen. It is not the Soviet Union that attacked Buraimi in the territory of Saudi Arabia. All of this is the record of Western countries in the Middle East over the past one hundred and fifty years."

    U.S. Representative Lodge introduced the revised second version of the U.S., British, French, and Canadian proposal on disarmament issues at the December 12 meeting.

    Head of the Soviet delegation Kuznetsov said that the proposers of the four-power proposal did not accept the Soviet delegation's main amendments. The Soviet delegation believes that it is best to emphasize in the preamble of the proposal the important achievements made in the past, specifically, the agreements already reached in determining the levels of armed forces and armaments and the effective date of the ban on atomic weapons. The Soviet delegation believes that the substantive part of the proposal regarding future work should more clearly stipulate that reaching an agreement on stopping the arms race so as to make it possible to implement a plan aimed at reducing armaments, prohibiting atomic weapons, and supervising the implementation of these measures remains the fundamental issue for the future. The four-power proposal stipulates that priority should be given to discussing suggestions on collecting arms intelligence and aerial reconnaissance, while placing the issue of drafting a disarmament convention in a secondary position, which the Soviet delegation cannot agree to, as it does not meet the requirements of the resolution adopted by the Ninth Session of the General Assembly. Soviet representative Sobolev, in explaining the Soviet delegation's reasons for voting, said that this proposal does not put forward any suggestions to seek the completion of the main task: drafting and adopting a unanimously agreed decision sufficient to end the arms race, eliminate the threat of atomic war, and help create conditions for all countries to obtain a peaceful and tranquil life. The four-power proposal replaces the solution to the problem of substantial reductions in armaments and armed forces, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and the establishment of effective international supervision, with the issue of studying the collection of military intelligence and reviewing materials on armed forces and armaments. Sobolev said that because the Soviet delegation's amendments were not accepted by the committee, the Soviet delegation voted against the four-power proposal. At the same time, the Soviet delegation wants to emphasize that the Soviet Union will continue to work hard to achieve a unanimously agreed decision to ensure that a practical and feasible plan for reducing armaments and armed forces and prohibiting atomic weapons can be realized.

    Indian representative Menon said that the four-power proposal deviates from the substance of the disarmament issue. He emphasized the importance of banning atomic weapons.

    After voting on the four-power proposal, the Political Committee originally had to vote on the Soviet proposal "on measures to further ease international tensions and develop international cooperation." However, British representative Nutting suggested not putting this proposal to a vote. The representatives of the United States and Britain and other delegations supporting them passed the British proposal, preventing the committee from passing the Soviet proposal aimed at further easing international tensions.

    联大政委会结束对裁军问题的讨论
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会在十二月十二日结束了对于裁军问题和“关于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的措施”的问题的讨论。
    在七日会议上，苏联代表库兹涅佐夫指责西方国家目前正在企图通过高谈搜集情报和调查武装部队和军备的情况来暗中转移人们对停止扩充军备、裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的讨论。库兹涅佐夫支持印度代表团提出的关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的建议。
    叙利亚代表舒凯里也在讨论中发言，理直气壮地抨击西方国家企图把近东局势紧张的责任推到苏联身上。舒凯里说，近东局势是国际局势紧张的原因之一，但是近东紧张局势既不是苏联制造的，又不是苏联加剧的。事实是，近东的动荡不安是西方一手制造的。他说，“苏联在中东没有一个军事基地，苏联在中东没有触犯过一个公民……镇压北非解放运动的不是苏联。制造巴勒斯坦问题这个大悲剧的不是苏联。轰击也门南部领土的不是苏联。袭击沙特阿拉伯领土布赖米的不是苏联。这一切都是过去一百五十年中西方国家在中东的记录。”
    美国代表洛奇在十二日会议上提出了美国、英国、法国和加拿大关于裁军问题的经过第二次修正的提案。
    苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫发言指出，四国提案的提案人没有接受苏联代表团的主要的修正意见。苏联代表团认为，最好在提案的序言中强调指出在过去时期中所取得的重要成就，具体地说，就是在确定武装部队和军备水平以及禁止原子武器的禁令生效日期的问题上所已经达成的协议。苏联代表团认为，在提案中关于将来工作的实质的一部分应当更加明确地规定：就停止军备竞赛达成协议以便有可能来执行一种目的在于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和对这些措施的实现进行监督的计划的问题，仍然是将来的根本问题。四国提案规定优先讨论关于搜集军备情报和空中侦察的建议，而把同起草裁军公约有关的问题置于次要地位，苏联代表团对于这一点不能同意，这样是不符合大会第九届会议通过的决议的要求的。苏联代表索波列夫在解释苏联代表团的投票理由时说，这个提案没有提出任何建议来谋求完成这个主要的任务：起草和通过一个足以结束军备竞赛、消除原子战争威胁以及帮助为各国获得和平和安宁的生活创造条件的一致同意的决定。四国提案用研究搜集军事情报、审查关于武装部队和军备的材料的问题来代替解决大量裁减军备和武装部队、禁止核子武器和建立有效的国际监督的问题。索波列夫说，因为苏联代表团的修正案没有被委员会接受，苏联代表团投票反对四国提案。同时，苏联代表团要强调指出，苏联将继续努力，争取达成一致同意的决定，以保证一个裁减军备和武装部队以及禁止原子武器的切实可行的计划得以实现。
    印度代表梅农说，四国提案离开了裁军问题的实质。他强调指出了禁止原子武器的重要性。
    在表决了四国提案以后，政治委员会原来还必须就苏联提出的“关于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的措施”的提案进行表决。但是英国代表纳丁却建议不把这项提案提付表决。美国和英国的代表团和其他支持它们的代表团通过了英国的建议，使委员会不能通过苏联提出的旨在进一步缓和国际紧张局势的提案。
