    Pay Attention to the Consolidation Work of Cooperatives in Disaster-stricken Areas
    Guangdong Province suffered a severe drought this year. Among the province's original 15,000-plus agricultural producers' cooperatives, about 20 percent experienced reduced harvests of summer crops. Although autumn crops increased in yield, some cooperatives still experienced reduced production. According to preliminary statistics from more than 7,800 old cooperatives, about 9 percent experienced reduced production. These cooperatives that experienced reduced production are currently facing varying degrees of difficulties in terms of cooperative production and members' livelihoods. For example, in Yuhu District, Jieyang County, only nine out of forty-five old cooperatives have fully or nearly raised enough production funds for next spring. The Qunxing Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in this district experienced a 20.96 percent reduction in production compared to last year; members are worried about the difficulty of surviving the spring famine next year. Out of the cooperative's thirty-five households, twenty-five have low production morale, and one has lost confidence in production and is demanding withdrawal from the cooperative. These situations indicate that strengthening leadership and assistance to cooperatives with reduced production, helping them overcome difficulties in production and livelihood, and consolidating the cooperatives, is a pressing task at present.
    The Guangdong Provincial Party Committees at all levels have issued instructions, requiring strengthening leadership over the consolidation of cooperatives with reduced production. At present, the key to consolidating cooperatives with reduced production is first to assist them in carrying out winter production well, ensuring the harvest and increased production of winter crops as much as possible; at the same time, it is necessary to develop winter sideline production according to local conditions, help members solve problems in production and life, and stabilize members' production morale. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient production funds next spring, it is necessary to do a good job in preparing for cultivation starting now, especially in accumulating manure, to reduce production costs next spring. Doing all this well will not only consolidate the cooperatives with reduced production but will also lay the foundation for increased production next year.

    注意受灾地区社的巩固工作
    广东省今年遭受了严重的旱灾。全省原有的一万五千多个农业生产合作社，夏收作物减产的占百分之二十左右。这些社秋季作物虽然增了产，但是一部分社减产了。据七千八百多个老社的初步统计，减产的社约占百分之九左右。这部分减产的社，目前在社的生产上和社员的生活上都已经发生不同程度的困难。比如揭阳县渔湖区四十五个老社，已经筹足或差不多筹足了明年春天的生产资金的只有九个社。这个区的群星农业生产合作社，今年比去年减产百分之二十点九六；社员忧虑明年春荒难度，全社三十五户，有二十五户生产情绪低落，有一户失却了生产信心，闹退社。这些情况说明，加强对减产社的领导和援助，帮助他们克服生产和生活上的困难，把社巩固下来，是当前一项迫切任务。
    广东省各级党委已经发出指示，要求加强对减产社的巩固工作的领导。目前巩固减产社的关键，首先是协助减产社搞好冬季生产，尽可能地保证冬种作物的收成和增产；同时要因地制宜地开展冬季副业生产，帮助社员解决生产和生活中的困难问题，安定社员的生产情绪。为了克服明春生产资金不足的困难，要从现在开始做好备耕工作，特别是做好积肥工作，降低明春的生产成本。做好这一切工作，不但可以使减产社得到巩固，也将为明年增产打下基础。
