Deng Yingchao continued: In the past and present, when we Chinese women were fighting against war, against colonialism, for national independence, and to protect the rights of women and children, we received the warm concern and strong support of the Women's International Democratic Federation and the women of various countries under its influence. When we are fully engaged in the great cause of peaceful construction, we have received their enthusiastic encouragement. This great international friendship is extremely precious to us, whether in the past, present or future.

In the future, domestically, our women must work together with the people of the whole country, actively engage in peaceful labor, learn from the experience of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and strive to complete and overfulfill my country's first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, and to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country; and use the achievements in labor to support our government and the people of the whole country in the struggle to liberate Taiwan. Internationally, under the banner of the Women's International Democratic Federation, we must further strengthen international unity, expand friendly exchanges with women from all countries, continue to promote the Geneva spirit and the Bandung Conference spirit, and strive for a further relaxation of the international situation, to prevent the outbreak of new wars, to defend world peace, and to defend the rights of women and children.
