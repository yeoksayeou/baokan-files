    Expansion Begins on the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project in Jiwei

    The large-scale expansion of the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project in Jiwei, Henan Province, has recently begun. The entire project is scheduled for completion in 1958. After the expansion is completed, the irrigated area of the Yellow River diversion area will increase from the original 720,000 mu to more than 1.3 million mu. In addition, the irrigated area can be expanded by 300,000 mu along the Wei River in Yanjin and Ji County. Shandong, Hebei, Tianjin and other provinces and cities can also use the diverted Yellow River water to expand the irrigated area of 290,000 mu of paddy fields, more than 1 million mu of wheat fields, and more than 600,000 mu of cotton fields. It is estimated that the country's grain output can be increased by more than 100 million jin per year. In addition, after the expansion project is completed, small ships can travel smoothly on the Wei River, and the transportation capacity will be greatly improved. Farmers near the main canal can also use the electricity from the project's drop power station for lighting and processing agricultural products.

    The expansion of the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project in Jiwei will be carried out in phases. The main part of the first phase of the project is the reinforcement of the canal head gate and the main canal, the establishment of the No. 3 drop power station, and the expansion of 210,000 mu of new irrigated area. At present, the technical design of the project has been completed, and some of the work is proceeding intensely.

    引黄灌溉济卫工程开始扩建
    河南省黄河下游引黄灌溉济卫工程最近已开始进行大规模的扩建，全部工程将在一九五八年完成。扩建工程完成后，引黄灌区的灌溉面积将从原来的七十二万亩扩大到一百三十多万亩。此外，还可以在卫河沿岸延津、汲县扩展灌溉面积三十万亩；山东、河北、天津等省市也可以利用引黄水量扩展灌溉稻田二十九万亩、麦田一百多万亩和棉田六十多万亩。估计每年可给国家增产粮食一亿多斤。此外，扩建工程完成后，卫河上小型轮船可畅行无阻，航运能力将大大提高。总干渠附近农民并可利用工程的跌水发电站的电力照明和对农产品进行加工。
    引黄灌溉济卫工程的扩建将分期进行，第一期工程主要部分为渠首闸及总干渠加固，建立三号跌水发电站，扩大二十一万亩新的灌溉面积。目前工程的技术设计已经作出，部分工程正在紧张进行中。
