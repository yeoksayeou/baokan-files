Such Extravagant Temporary Projects

The 306 Exploration Team of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Geological Bureau has built some temporary projects this year that are even more extravagant than permanent ones. According to national regulations, the cost per square meter of office space should be 45 yuan, but their temporary on-site offices cost as much as 65 yuan per square meter, exceeding the national standard by 20 yuan. What is particularly serious is that they have also expanded the construction area by 600 square meters without authorization.

The General Design Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering designed a standard three-story dormitory suitable for the North China region this year, with facilities such as electric lights, water supply and drainage, and washbasins. Such a permanent building costs only 44 yuan per square meter to build. However, the temporary staff dormitory of the 306 Exploration Team costs as much as 45 yuan per square meter. They also used some unnecessary decorations such as "red waistbands" in these temporary projects, which wasted 2,400 yuan in expenses alone.

The characteristic of geological exploration work is high mobility. Generally, temporary projects are demolished after being used for one or two years as the exploration team moves. Therefore, if there are old buildings that can be utilized, they should be fully utilized. When new construction is necessary, the standards should be lowered in the spirit of thrift. However, the 306 Exploration Team has built temporary projects that are even better than permanent projects.

The relevant departments in charge should immediately correct these serious acts of waste!

    这么阔气的临时工程
    重工业部地质局三○六勘探队今年新建了一些比永久工程还要阔气得多的临时工程。按国家规定，办公室每平方公尺的造价应该是四十五元，而他们的临时工地办公室每平方公尺造价竟高达六十五元，超过国家规定标准二十元。尤其严重的是，他们还擅自把建筑面积扩大了六百平方公尺。
    建筑工程部设计总局今年设计的一种适用于华北地区的三层楼房的标准宿舍，有电灯、上下水、洗涤盘等设备。这样的永久建筑，每平方公尺的造价不过四十四元。但是，三○六勘探队的临时职工宿舍每平方公尺造价竟高达四十五元。他们在这些临时工程中，还采用了一些“红腰带”等不必要的装饰，只是这笔开支就浪费了二千四百元。
    地质勘探工作的特点是流动性大，一般临时工程都是使用一、两年以后就随着勘探队的转移而被拆除。因此，凡有旧建筑物可以利用的，就应充分加以利用；不得已需要新建的时候，也应该本着节约精神把标准降低一些。但是，三○六勘探队竟把临时工程盖得比永久性工程还要好。
    对于这一些严重的浪费行为，这几个主管部门应该马上加以纠正！
