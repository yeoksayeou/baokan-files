Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd – A joint conference of administrative leaders and trade union chairmen from enterprises within the production and capital construction system of the Ministry of Heavy Industry opened in Beijing today.

The main task of this conference is to discuss how to further accelerate the development of the iron and steel, non-ferrous metal, chemical, and building materials industries, to ensure the early completion of the production and capital construction plans for the Ministry of Heavy Industry system as stipulated in the state's first Five-Year Plan, and to formulate the basic measures for achieving these plans.

Minister of Heavy Industry Wang Heshou delivered a report at today's meeting. He pointed out that the iron and steel, non-ferrous metal, chemical, and building materials industries under the Ministry of Heavy Industry bear very heavy tasks in socialist construction. Although various industries under the Ministry of Heavy Industry have made great progress in recent years, they are still far from meeting the needs of national construction. Therefore, it is necessary to take various effective measures to ensure the accelerated development of various industries under the Ministry of Heavy Industry and to ensure the early completion of the production and construction tasks stipulated in the state's first Five-Year Plan. In his report, Wang Heshou cited many specific examples to illustrate that there is still great potential in the production and capital construction units under the Ministry of Heavy Industry. He said that as long as leaders at all levels overcome conservative ideas, take various effective measures, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and engineering and technical personnel to tap potential strength, the smooth realization of various production and capital construction plans can be guaranteed. Wang Heshou finally put forward various basic measures to ensure the early completion of the five-year production and construction plan, and asked the representatives attending the meeting to discuss them.

This conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the National Committee of the Chinese Heavy Industry Trade Union. More than 800 people attended the meeting, including factory directors, mine managers, and managers of production and capital construction units under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, as well as the secretaries of the CCP committees and trade union chairmen of these units. Representatives from relevant central units also attended the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd – Our reporter learned today from responsible sources at the Ministry of Heavy Industry that the various production systems under the Ministry of Heavy Industry have the conditions to complete the production plans stipulated in the state's first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. According to the draft 1956 production plan recently formulated by the Ministry, the total output value of various production systems in 1956 can reach about 99% of the 1957 target. Among the 22 major products of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system, the output of 11 products will reach or basically reach the 1957 level in 1956; if sales expand, the output of several other products can also reach the 1957 level. As long as production enterprises further tap potential capacity, the output of the remaining products can also approach the level stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan in 1956.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Heavy Industry believes that it is entirely possible to complete the five-year production plan ahead of schedule. In the past three years, employees of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system have overfulfilled the state's production plan every year. It is estimated that this year's total output value can exceed the state's annual plan by 6% and reach 84.7% of the target stipulated for the final year of the first Five-Year Plan. The output of ten of the 22 major products of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system can reach more than 80% of the 1957 target this year. Among them, the output of several products is expected to reach or approach the 1957 target this year. The person in charge of the Ministry of Heavy Industry said that on this basis, as long as the broad masses of workers and engineering and technical personnel further give play to their enthusiasm and creativity, conscientiously study and promote international new technologies, mainly from the Soviet Union, and advanced domestic technical experience, actively implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and overcome various backward links in production, there is a reliable guarantee for completing the five-year plan ahead of schedule.

The four industrial systems under the Ministry of Heavy Industry—iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, and building materials—mainly produce raw materials and building materials for various industries, transportation, and construction departments, and provide chemical fertilizers and pesticides for agriculture. The person in charge of the Ministry said that the early completion of the five-year plan by the Ministry of Heavy Industry will not only lay a good foundation for the successful completion of the second Five-Year Plan by this industrial system but also provide favorable conditions for various sectors of the national economy to accelerate the pace of production and construction, and will also strongly support the agricultural cooperation movement.

    重工业部生产和建设系统开始采取措施  
    保证提前完成五年计划
    新华社二十二日讯　重工业部所属生产、基本建设系统的企业行政领导干部和工会主席联席会议今天在北京开幕。
    这次会议的主要任务，是讨论如何进一步加快钢铁、有色金属、化学和建筑材料工业的发展速度，保证提前完成国家第一个五年计划规定的重工业部系统生产和基本建设的计划，并且制定实现这些计划的基本措施。
    重工业部部长王鹤寿在今天的会议上作了报告。他指出，重工业部所属的钢铁、有色金属、化学和建筑材料工业，在社会主义建设中担负着很繁重的任务。几年来，重工业部所属各类工业虽然有很大发展，但是还远远不能满足国家建设的需要。因此，必须采取各种有效措施，保证重工业部所属各类工业加速发展，并且保证提前完成国家第一个五年计划规定的生产和建设任务。王鹤寿在报告中举出了许多具体事例，说明重工业部所属生产和基本建设单位中还存在很大的潜力。他说，只要各级领导干部克服保守思想，采取各种有效措施，充分发挥广大职工和工程技术人员的积极性、创造性，挖掘潜在力量，就可以保证各项生产和基本建设计划的顺利实现。王鹤寿最后还提出了保证提前完成五年生产建设计划的各项基本措施，要求到会代表加以讨论。
    这次会议是重工业部和中国重工业工会全国委员会联合召开的。参加会议的有重工业部所属生产和基本建设单位的厂长、矿长、经理以及这些单位的中共党委书记、工会主席等共八百多人。中央各有关单位也派代表出席了会议。
    新华社二十二日讯　本社记者今天从重工业部负责方面获悉：重工业部所属各生产系统，有条件提前完成国家第一个五年计划规定的生产计划。根据这个部最近制定的一九五六年生产计划草案，各生产系统一九五六年的总产值，可以达到一九五七年指标的百分之九十九左右。重工业部系统二十二种主要产品中，有十一种产品的产量在一九五六年将要达到或基本上达到一九五七年的水平；还有几种产品如果销路扩大也可以达到一九五七年的水平。其余产品的产量，只要生产企业进一步发挥潜在能力，一九五六年也都能够接近第一个五年计划规定的水平。
    重工业部的负责人认为：提前完成五年生产计划是完全可能的。过去三年中，重工业部系统职工每年都超额完成了国家的生产计划，预计今年生产总值可以超过国家年度计划百分之六，达到第一个五年计划最后一年规定指标的百分之八十四点七。重工业部系统二十二种主要产品的产量有十种今年可以达到一九五七年指标的百分之八十以上，其中有几种产品的产量预计今年可以达到或接近一九五七年的指标。重工业部的负责人说，在这个基础上，只要广大职工和工程技术人员进一步发挥积极性和创造性，认真学习和推广以苏联为主的国际新技术和国内先进技术经验，积极贯彻苏联专家建议，克服生产中各个落后环节，提前完成五年计划是有可靠的保证的。
    重工业部所属的钢铁、有色金属、化学和建筑材料四个产业系统，主要为各工业、交通运输业和建筑部门生产原材料和建筑材料，并且为农业提供化学肥料和农药。这个部的负责人说，重工业部提前完成五年计划，不但可以为本产业系统胜利完成第二个五年计划打下良好基础，而且为国民经济各部门加快生产建设的速度提供了有利条件，同时将有力支援农业合作化运动。
