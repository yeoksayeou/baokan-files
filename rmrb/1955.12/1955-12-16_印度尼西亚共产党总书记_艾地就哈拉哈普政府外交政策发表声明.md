Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 15th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" published on the 14th a statement by Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit regarding the Harahap government's foreign policy. In his statement, Aidit demanded that the West Irian issue continue to be discussed at the United Nations, that the protocol dissolving the Indonesian-Dutch Union be ratified, that the government's statement on foreign investment be retracted, and that Indonesian-Dutch negotiations be halted.

Aidit said that the Indonesian Communist Party has repeatedly stated that the foreign policy pursued by Foreign Minister Agung is very dangerous. The Harahap cabinet's policy on the West Irian issue is to continue making concessions to the Netherlands, such as releasing Dutch police officer Van Krieken, issuing a statement on foreign investment policy, and removing the West Irian issue from the UN agenda.

Aidit said that including "certain issues regarding West Irian" on the agenda of the Indonesian-Dutch negotiations is clearly not strengthening the struggle to realize Indonesian sovereignty over West Irian. On the contrary, it provides a pretext for removing the West Irian issue from the UN agenda and turning the issue into a "domestic affair" of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Aidit continued, before Indonesia held negotiations with the Netherlands, the Indonesian government issued a policy statement on foreign capital investment in Indonesia. Some enterprises stipulated in this policy statement as not being open to foreign capital were never the object of foreign investment. However, enterprises in which foreign capital has consistently invested, such as banks, large plantations, import and export businesses, warehouses, and sugar factories, were not mentioned or restricted at all. This means that national enterprises will face strong competition and will become helpless in the competition. This will also make Indonesia even more dependent on foreign capital.

Aidit said that the current cabinet has taken and is taking measures with far-reaching consequences. Some government parties are asking the Provisional Parliament, which has virtually no power, to approve the results of Indonesian-Dutch negotiations, which will naturally greatly damage the interests of the country.

Aidit said that in order to avoid more serious disasters befalling the Republic of Indonesia, the Indonesian Communist Party calls on all the people and all democratic parties to stop this foreign policy that harms Indonesia's national interests.

### 印度尼西亚共产党总书记  艾地就哈拉哈普政府外交政策发表声明

    印度尼西亚共产党总书记
    艾地就哈拉哈普政府外交政策发表声明
    新华社雅加达十五日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”十四日刊载了印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地就哈拉哈普政府的外交政策发表的声明。艾地在声明中要求使西伊里安问题继续成为联合国讨论的问题，批准解散印度尼西亚—荷兰联邦的议定书，收回政府关于外国投资的声明，以及停止印度尼西亚—荷兰谈判。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党曾一再声明，外交部长阿贡所奉行的外交政策是非常危险的。哈拉哈普内阁对西伊里安问题的政策是继续向荷兰让步，例如释放荷兰警官范克里肯，发表关于外国投资政策的声明，从联合国议程中撤销西伊里安问题等。
    艾地说，把“关于西伊里安的某些问题”列入印度尼西亚—荷兰谈判的议程中，显然不是在加强为实现印度尼西亚对西伊里安的主权而进行的斗争。相反，这是替从联合国议程中撤销西伊里安问题和使这个问题变成荷兰王国的“内政问题”的行动提供借口。
    艾地继续说，在印度尼西亚同荷兰举行谈判以前，印度尼西亚政府发表了关于在印度尼西亚的外国资本投资的政策声明。这个政策声明中规定的不准外国资本投资的一些企业本来就不是外国投资的对象，而外国资本所一直投资的企业，像银行、大种植园、进出口业、栈房和糖厂等却根本没有被提到或者受到限制。这意味着民族企业经济将遭到强烈的竞争，同时在竞争中会变得毫无办法。这也会使印度尼西亚甚至更加依赖外国资本。
    艾地说，目前的内阁已经采取了并且正在采取有深远后果的措施。有些政府党派要求实际上没有权力的临时国会来批准印度尼西亚同荷兰谈判的结果，这自然会大大地损害国家的利益。
    艾地说，为了避免印度尼西亚共和国遭到更加严重的祸害，印度尼西亚共产党要求全体人民和各民主党派来制止这种危害印度尼西亚国家利益的外交政策。
