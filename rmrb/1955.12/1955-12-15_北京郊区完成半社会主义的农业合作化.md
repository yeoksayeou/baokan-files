Xinhua News Agency, December 14th. The suburbs of Beijing have completed the historical task of realizing semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. As of the 13th, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives in the five near suburbs has reached 90% of the total number of peasant households; the number of poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and upper-middle peasants who have joined cooperatives has accounted for more than 97% of the total number of peasant households in these classes. In addition, in forty townships, all peasant households except landlords and rich peasants have joined cooperatives. The Jingxi Mining Area also has 86.2% of its peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives. Now, the focus of work in the suburbs has shifted to organizing winter production and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. The 110,000 peasant households that have already joined cooperatives are engaging in winter production with unparalleled enthusiasm and are actively preparing to welcome next year's production upsurge.

The agricultural cooperativization movement in the suburbs of Beijing has developed extremely rapidly. This autumn, the original plans for developing agricultural production cooperatives in various districts and townships have been repeatedly exceeded. The CPC Nanyuan District Committee originally planned to develop 4,000 peasant households to join cooperatives, but before the publicity even started, more than 3,500 peasant households in the district had voluntarily signed up to join. As a result, 6,398 peasant households joined the cooperatives. The Gaobeidian Township in the eastern suburbs district initially set the first expansion plan at 50 households, which was later revised three times, increasing to 200 households. During the initial publicity, 390 peasant households signed up to join the cooperatives in the first batch.

In the early stages of the development of agricultural production cooperatives, some cadres worried that the cooperatives would be difficult to manage if they became too large. At the same time, they were not actively recruiting elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed peasant households. Some cadres lacked education for those upper-middle peasants who wanted to join cooperatives but did not have a sufficient understanding of the cooperativization movement. Some cadres also did not appropriately address the issue of part-time worker-peasants and part-time merchant-peasants requesting to join cooperatives. In view of the above situation, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC immediately gave specific instructions. The CPC District Committees immediately convened meetings of district and township party member cadres, further criticized right-leaning ideas, formulated comprehensive plans, and adopted the method of first absorbing poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and then absorbing upper-middle peasants into the cooperatives. Members of the CPC District Committees personally led working groups to the townships to help with the work and organized a large number of propaganda teams to carry out propaganda activities. Most veteran cooperative members also used their own experiences to conduct in-depth household propaganda. After the above measures were taken, the vast majority of elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed households, and part-time worker-peasants and part-time merchant-peasants were respectively absorbed into the cooperatives.

During the period of great development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the suburbs of Beijing, workers and staff from nearby factories and mines gave great support to the peasants. Workers from the Shijingshan Power Plant organized agricultural cooperativization propaganda teams, carrying cartoons and slogans to Mayu Township to publicize the significance of cooperativization and the principles and policies for carrying out the cooperativization movement. They also promised the cooperative members to use their spare time to repair their farm tools. Teachers from various departments of Beijing Agricultural University helped the Si Ji Qing Vegetable Production Cooperative solve a series of agricultural technical problems after its expansion. At the celebration of the full cooperativization of Landianchang Township, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing presented an agricultural production cooperative with a two-wheeled double-share plow. At present, more than 300 agencies, organizations, schools, and units of the armed forces stationed in Beijing have established connections with agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs.

### 北京郊区完成半社会主义的农业合作化

    北京郊区完成半社会主义的农业合作化
    新华社十四日讯　北京市郊区已经完成实现半社会主义性质的农业合作化的历史任务。到十三日止，近郊五个区入社农户已经达到农户总数的百分之九十；入社的贫农、下中农和上中农农户已经分别占到这些阶层的农户总数的百分之九十七以上。另外有四十个乡，除地主富农外，全部农户都已经入社。京西矿区也已经有百分之八十六点二的农户参加了农业生产合作社。现在，郊区的工作中心已经转入组织冬季生产和整顿巩固农业生产合作社，已经入社的十一万户农户正以无比兴奋的心情投入冬季生产，并积极准备迎接明年生产高潮。
    北京市郊区农业合作化运动发展极快。今年秋天各区、乡原订的发展农业生产合作社的计划都一再被突破。中共南苑区委员会原计划发展四千户农户入社，还没有开始宣传，全区就已经有三千五百多户农户自动报名入社。结果入社农户达到了六千三百九十八户。东郊区高碑店乡第一次扩社计划确定为五十户，后来修改三次，增加到二百户。在刚刚宣传的时候，第一批就有三百九十户农户报名入社。
    在农业生产合作社发展初期，有些干部担心社大了不好办，同时对孤寡老弱的农户不积极吸收；有些干部对于那些有入社要求、但是对合作化运动认识不够的上中农缺乏教育；有些干部对半工半农户和半商半农户要求入社的问题也没有适当加以解决。根据上述情况，中共北京市委员会立即作了具体指示。中共各区委员会当即召开了区、乡党员干部会议，进一步批判了右倾思想，拟定了全面规划，采取了先吸收贫农、下中农，后吸收上中农入社的办法。中共各区委员会委员亲自带领工作组分头下乡帮助工作，并且组织大批宣传队伍，开展宣传活动。大多数老社社员也结合自己的事例深入到户进行宣传。采取了上述措施以后，绝大多数孤寡老弱户和半工半农户、半商半农户都分别被吸收入社。
    北京市郊区农业合作化运动大发展的时期，附近厂矿的工人、职员给农民以很大的支持。石景山发电厂工人组织农业合作化宣传队，带着漫画和标语到麻峪乡向农民宣传合作化的意义和开展合作化运动的方针、政策，并且向合作社社员提出保证，用业余时间给他们修理农具。北京农业大学各系教师帮助扩社以后的四季青蔬菜生产合作社解决一系列的农业技术问题。在蓝靛厂乡庆祝全乡合作化大会上，中国人民解放军驻北京某部赠送给农业生产合作社一部双轮双铧犁。目前首都已经有三百多个机关、团体、学校和驻京部队的单位同郊区农业生产合作社建立了联系。
