    Penny Wise, Pound Foolish
    The cotton towels used on the sizing rollers in the sizing workshop of the State-owned Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory originally required twelve pieces a month. After the launch of the conservation movement, workers found ways to conserve, using only eight pieces a month. After the workshop implemented cost accounting for work teams, the workshop staff regarded saving on cotton towels as a "trick" for conservation, and after late September, they simply stopped claiming them altogether.

    Cotton towels are elastic and can evenly press the sizing into the yarn fibers. This is essential to ensure the quality of the cloth. However, the sizing workshop of the Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory simply eliminated it. As a result, although twelve fewer cotton towels were used, saving 144 yuan, the cotton towels on the sizing rollers hardened and lost their elasticity because they were not replaced for a long time, and could not absorb the sizing. The sized warps had too little sizing, and the fibers would fray when rubbed by the shuttle on the looms. As a result, in October, the warps had too much fuzz, making them prone to breakage and difficult to work with, resulting in a reduction of 445 bolts of cotton cloth produced. Semi-finished products (sized yarn) piled up in large quantities, exceeding the reserve quota by 11,453 pounds, tying up 13,743 yuan of capital. Due to insufficient sizing, the warp fibers were difficult to separate, resulting in the production of 39 more bolts of substandard cloth, reducing sales revenue by 27 yuan. Because so much fuzzy cloth was produced, it was not durable, causing losses to consumers.

    What lessons should be learned from this incident? This is that any enterprise, workshop, team, and individual must consider the overall situation when adopting any conservation measures, and not "pick up sesame seeds and lose the watermelon," becoming penny wise and pound foolish.

    得不偿失
    国营石家庄第一棉纺织厂浆纱车间压浆辊上用的毛巾布，原来一个月要用十二条。节约运动开展后，工人们想办法节约，一个月只用了八条。车间实行班组节约核算以后，车间工作人员把省用毛巾布当作节约的“窍门”，到九月下旬以后干脆一条也不领了。
    毛巾布有弹性，可以把浆均匀地压到纱的纤维里去。这是保证布的质量所不可缺少的。但是，石家庄第一棉纺织厂浆纱车间竟把它省掉了。结果虽然毛巾布少用了十二条，节省了一百四十四元，但是压浆辊上的毛巾布因为久不调换而发硬，失去了弹性，吸不上浆，浆出来的织轴因为浆小，到布机上经梭子一磨就起毛了。结果十月份由于织轴毛多，容易断头，活不好干，竟少生产了四百四十五匹棉布；在制品（浆过的纱）大量堆积起来，超出储备定额一万一千四百五十三磅，积压了资金一万三千七百四十三元；由于浆小，织轴纤维不好分开，多生产了次布三十九匹，降低了售价二十七元；由于生产了许多毛布，不耐穿，又给消费者带来了损失。
    从这件事情中应该得到什么教训呢？这就是任何企业、车间、小组和个人，在采取任何节约措施的时候，必须全盘考虑，不要“拣了芝麻，掉了西瓜”，得不偿失了。
