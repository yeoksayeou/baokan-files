The attempts of "Cold War" promoters are bound to fail
	Gao Ji

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council held a ministerial meeting on December 15th and 16th. At this meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles went to great lengths to distort the situation, incite NATO countries to engage in a "new Cold War," and force them to continue expanding their armaments.

This step taken by international reactionaries after the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference completely betrays the positive results achieved at the Four Powers Summit this summer and is a blatant violation of the "Geneva spirit." This once again clearly shows how afraid they are of the easing of the international situation brought about by the "Geneva spirit" and therefore try to prevent or reverse this development of the international situation.

People know that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference did not achieve any significant results because the United States and its Western partners were unwilling to abandon the bankrupt "policy of strength." However, despite such obstacles, the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries have continued to work to enhance international cooperation and ease international tensions, and have produced good results. It should be particularly pointed out in this regard that the visits of Soviet leaders to important Asian countries such as India, Burma, and Afghanistan, as well as the resolution of the issue of the admission of new member states to the United Nations, are major achievements in the cause of international cooperation. On the other hand, the "policy of strength" and military bloc policy pursued by the United States have been met with increasingly widespread condemnation and opposition, and have deepened the quarrels and divisions within NATO. The movement in West Germany against remilitarization and the Paris Accords has resonated within the Adenauer government group, especially the Free Democratic Party, which is dissatisfied with NATO's policy and has proposed direct negotiations with the Soviet Union. The deterioration of relations between Turkey and Greece caused by the Cyprus issue has not been resolved, and the contradictions between France and West Germany are becoming increasingly apparent around the Saar issue and West Germany's planned new armed forces exceeding the so-called "limit." The powerful movement of the people of Arab countries, especially the people of Jordan, against the Baghdad Pact has overthrown the Magali cabinet, which intended to join the treaty under U.S. and British pressure. This situation shows how irresistible the forces demanding peace and international cooperation are, and how unpopular the "policy of strength" and military bloc policy are.

It is precisely the repeated failures of the "policy of strength" that have led to many complaints and criticisms from within the U.S. ruling group and the newspapers of NATO countries recently, criticizing the current U.S. foreign policy and demanding a re-examination. However, the U.S. reactionary forces have so far not only refused to abandon the "policy of strength" but have also attempted to re-intensify the "Cold War" and strengthen military blocs and expand armaments. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' speech in Chicago on December 8 openly advocated that the United States should implement "two interrelated" policies, namely the so-called "political warning system" (i.e., military blocs) and "deterrent power" (i.e., atomic armaments), and also called on NATO countries to "continue to build their own unity." In this situation, Dulles chose the NATO Council of Ministers meeting as a place for him to issue orders and instigate a "Cold War." Western news agencies have long revealed that NATO wants to formulate a strategy to "deal with the Soviet Union" at this meeting.

It must be pointed out that Dulles and his ilk's methods of inciting the "Cold War" are becoming increasingly clumsy. At the NATO Council of Ministers meeting, Dulles even described the strengthening of friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Asian and Middle Eastern countries, and even the Soviet Union's economic cooperation with these countries, as a "serious threat." Former British Foreign Secretary Macmillan's broadcast speech on the evening of December 17 also repeated this absurd argument. It is obvious to all that the strengthening of friendly cooperative relations between the Soviet Union and Asian and Middle Eastern countries vividly reflects the Soviet Union's unremitting efforts to strengthen international cooperation and promote the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, and also reflects the firm implementation of a policy of peace and independence by Asian and Middle Eastern countries. The international reactionary forces' shouting and screaming can only expose how jealous they are of the progress of international cooperation and also prove that they are still unwilling to respect the independent will of Asian and Middle Eastern countries. The expression of the imperialists' colonial greed, who still regard Asia and the Middle East as their objects of plunder, will have no other result than to arouse the indignation of the people of Asia and the Middle East and the public around the world.

Needless to say, this outburst by Dulles and Macmillan aims to worsen the international situation in order to urge NATO countries to strengthen their war preparations to support the military bloc policy that has recently been greatly shaken. The communiqué of the NATO Council meeting issued on December 16 announced that the "Atlantic forces will be equipped with the latest weapons" and "the coordination of air defense in European countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will be reorganized and strengthened." In other words, it is to implement the so-called "New Look Strategy" of using nuclear weapons, which U.S. General Gruenther has long been planning, and the so-called unified "air defense" plan to establish a "tight chain from northern Norway to eastern Turkey." Not to mention that this "New Look Strategy" of stepping up preparations for a nuclear war cannot but increase the danger of a new war and runs completely counter to the "Geneva spirit," it will also cause a series of new problems within NATO.

Some Western news agencies have estimated that this "atomic New Look will cost twice as much as conventional defense," so implementing this "strategy" will greatly increase the military expenditures of NATO countries. This is clearly something that some NATO countries, which are already in an increasingly deep financial and economic crisis due to long-term arms expansion and war preparation, cannot afford. Reuters reporter Priddle also acknowledged in a dispatch: "All NATO governments are already eager to reduce their defense budgets after five years of peak spending." Therefore, even the military observer of the British "Observer" complained that "this foreshadows a bad future for the governments of NATO countries." At the same time, since most NATO countries do not possess nuclear weapons, the result of implementing the so-called "New Look Strategy" and unified "air defense" plan cannot but further damage their sovereignty and threaten their security. How can this not be met with fierce opposition from the people of Western European countries and all patriotic forces, and cause more serious difficulties in promoting NATO policy?

The participants of the NATO Council meeting placed the main direction of their strengthening of war preparation activities on accelerating the implementation of West Germany's remilitarization. To achieve this goal, the Western European Union, under the command of U.S. generals, passed the so-called "maximum limit" for West German rearmament, and the communiqué of the NATO Council meeting also attempted to deny the existence of the German Democratic Republic. Of course, people know that the German Democratic Republic exists and develops, representing the democratic forces of the entire Germany and the future of Germany, which will never be changed by the fantasies of the ambitious of NATO. However, this communiqué also illustrates a fact, that is: Dulles and those ambitious people who are keen on the Cold War and arms expansion are determined not to allow Germany to be peacefully unified and are trying to turn the entire Germany into their war base. This also adds to the task of the German people and the people of European countries to safeguard European security and strive for the restoration of Germany's peaceful reunification.

All these practices of the international reactionary forces cannot strengthen their bankrupt "position of strength." Because it is very clear that it has not and cannot eliminate the deep-rooted contradictions within NATO. The ministers of NATO countries did not discuss at all the issues that caused their internal divisions at this meeting, such as the Cyprus issue and the Saar issue, let alone eliminate these divisions. At the same time, NATO countries are facing new difficulties and divisions caused by expanding armaments and accelerating West Germany's remilitarization. Therefore, even the British "Observer" believes that the NATO Council meeting "proved to be ineffective."

The peace-loving people of all countries have further recognized from this NATO Council meeting where the root cause lies in the failure to further ease the international situation. Some figures in Western countries, headed by the U.S. reactionary forces, are attempting to mislead people's vision and bury the "Geneva spirit" with the call for a "new Cold War," which is impossible. The "Geneva spirit" is the manifestation of the peace-loving will of the people of all countries, and it will not disappear. More and more countries are now pursuing a policy of peace and international friendly cooperation, and the international situation will continue to develop along the path of the "Geneva spirit," despite the great obstacles. In order to safeguard the "Geneva spirit," the people of all countries must resolutely oppose the arrogant attempts of the new "Cold War" promoters and persevere in the struggle to win peace and strengthen international cooperation to the end.

    “冷战”鼓吹者的企图一定失败
    高集
    北大西洋集团理事会于十二月十五日和十六日举行了部长会议。在这个会议上，美国国务卿杜勒斯竭力歪曲局势，煽动北大西洋集团国家进行“新的冷战”，并强使它们继续扩张军备。
    国际反动势力在日内瓦四国外长会议之后采取的这种步骤，完全背弃了今年夏天四国政府首脑会议所取得的积极成果，并且是对“日内瓦精神”的一种公然的破坏。这再一次清楚地表明，它们是多么害怕“日内瓦精神”所促成的国际局势的和缓，因而竭力企图阻止或者扭转国际局势的这种发展。
    人们知道，四国外长会议由于美国以及它的西方伙伴还不肯放弃已经破了产的“实力政策”，而没有取得任何重大的结果。但是，尽管存在着这样的阻碍，苏联和其他爱好和平国家还是继续为着增进国际合作和缓和国际紧张局势而努力，并且产生了良好的效果。在这方面应该特别指出，苏联领袖对亚洲重要国家印度、缅甸和阿富汗的访问，以及联合国接纳新会员国问题的解决，是国际合作事业的重大成就。另一方面，美国奉行的“实力政策”和军事集团政策受到了越来越为广泛的谴责和反对，并加深了北大西洋集团内部的争吵和分歧。西德反对重新军国主义化和巴黎协定的运动，已在阿登纳政府集团内部引起了反响，特别是自由民主党对北大西洋集团政策感到不满，提出了同苏联直接谈判的主张。由于塞浦路斯问题引起的土耳其和希腊关系的恶化没有平复，而围绕着萨尔问题和西德计划中的新的武装部队超过所谓“限额”问题，又使法国和西德的矛盾日益表面化。阿拉伯国家人民、特别是约旦人民反对巴格达条约的强大运动，已把在美英压力下打算参加这个条约的马加利内阁推倒。这种情形说明，要求和平和国际合作的力量是如何地不可抗阻，而“实力政策”和军事集团政策又是如何地不得人心。
    不是别的，正是“实力政策”的一再失败，使得美国统治集团内部以及北大西洋集团国家的报纸最近发出了不少的抱怨和批评，抨击美国的现行外交政策，并要求重新研究。但是，美国反动势力迄今不但不肯放弃“实力政策”，反而企图重新加剧“冷战”并企图加强军事集团和扩张军备。美国国务卿杜勒斯十二月八日在芝加哥发表的演说，就公开鼓吹美国要执行“两种互相有关”的政策，即所谓“政治警告体系”（即军事集团）和“威慑力量”（即原子军备），并且还号召北大西洋集团国家“继续建立它们自己的团结”。在这种情况下，杜勒斯选定了北大西洋集团理事会部长会议来作为他发号施令和煽动“冷战”的场所。西方国家通讯社早就透露北大西洋集团要在这次会议上制定“对付苏联”的策略了。
    不能不指出，杜勒斯之流煽动“冷战”的手法是越来越笨拙了。在北大西洋集团理事会部长会议上，杜勒斯竟然把苏联和亚洲以及中东国家友好合作关系的加强，甚至把苏联同这些国家的经济合作说成是一种“严重的威胁”。英国前外交大臣麦克米伦十二月十七日晚发表的广播演说，也重复了这种荒唐的论调。人所共见，苏联同亚洲以及中东国家友好合作关系的加强，生动地体现了苏联不懈地加强国际合作和努力促进不同社会制度的国家和平共处的政策，同时也体现了亚洲和中东国家坚定地执行着和平独立的政策。国际反动势力如此大嚷大叫，只能暴露出它们是如何地嫉视国际合作事业的进展，同时也证明了它们至今还不愿意尊重亚洲和中东国家的独立意志。帝国主义者把亚洲和中东依然看作是它们的掠夺对象的这种殖民贪欲的表现，除了激起亚洲和中东人民以及全世界公众的愤慨之外，是不会有别的结果的。
    不用说，杜勒斯和麦克米伦的这一番发作，其目的是想恶化国际局势，以便督促北大西洋集团国家加强备战活动，来支撑最近大大动摇了的军事集团政策。十二月十六日发表的北大西洋集团理事会的会议公报宣布要把“大西洋军队用最新式的武器装备起来”，并且“改组和加强北大西洋公约组织的欧洲国家中的防空的配合”。换句话说，也就是要实行美国将军格伦瑟早在策划中的使用核子武器的所谓“新面貌战略”，以及建立一条“从挪威北部到土耳其东部的紧紧的锁链”的所谓统一“空防”计划。且不说这种加紧准备核子战争的“新面貌战略”不能不增加新战争的危险同“日内瓦精神”完全背道而驰，而且它将在北大西洋内部引起一连串的新的问题。
    一些西方国家的通讯社曾经估计说，这种“原子新面貌花的钱将相当于常规防务花的钱的两倍”，从而执行这种“战略”就要大大增加北大西洋集团国家的军事费用。这显然是一些已经由于长期的扩军备战而处于日益加深的财政经济危机的北大西洋集团国家承受不起的。路透社记者普里德尔在一则电讯中也承认：“所有北大西洋公约组织各国政府已经在渴望能在开支达到最高峰的五年以后裁减它们的国防预算。”因此，连英国“观察家报”的军事观察员也抱怨说，“这给北大西洋公约组织国家的政府预兆的是不好的前途。”同时，由于大多数北大西洋集团国家并不拥有核子武器，因此实行所谓“新面貌战略”以及统一“空防”计划的结果，不能不进一步损害它们的主权和威胁它们的安全。这如何能不遭到西欧各国人民和一切爱国力量的激烈反对，并引起推行北大西洋政策更为严重的困难？
    北大西洋集团理事会的参加者把它们加强备战活动的主要方向，放在加速实行西德的重新军国主义化上面。为了达到这个目的，受美国将军指挥的西欧联盟通过了西德重新武装的所谓“最高限额”，并且北大西洋集团理事会的会议公报还企图否认德意志民主共和国的存在。当然人们知道，德意志民主共和国存在和发展着，它代表着全德国的民主力量和德国的未来，这绝不会由于北大西洋集团的野心家们的空想而有所改变。但是，这个公报也说明了一个事实，那就是：杜勒斯和那些热衷于冷战和扩张军备的野心家们，决心不让德国和平统一，并企图把整个德国变成它们的战争基地。这也就加重了德国人民和欧洲各国人民为保障欧洲安全和争取恢复德国和平统一而斗争的任务。
    国际反动势力的这一切做法，并不能加强它们的已经破了产的“实力地位”。因为事情很明显，它没有而且也不可能消除北大西洋集团内部的根深蒂固的矛盾。北大西洋集团的部长们在这次会议上对于引起它们内部分歧的那些问题，如塞浦路斯问题、萨尔问题，根本没有讨论，更不用说消除这种分歧了。同时，北大西洋集团各国又面对着扩张军备和加速西德重新军国主义化而引起的新的困难和分歧。因此，连英国“观察家报”也认为北大西洋集团理事会的会议“证明是没有效果的”。
    各国爱好和平人民从这次北大西洋集团理事会会议更加认清国际局势不能进一步缓和的根源何在了。以美国反动势力为首的西方国家的一些人物，企图以“新的冷战”号召来迷惑人们的视线，埋葬“日内瓦精神”，这是办不到的。“日内瓦精神”是各国人民爱好和平意志的表现，它是不会消失的。现在奉行和平和国际友好合作政策的国家越来越多了，国际局势将继续沿着“日内瓦精神”的道路发展，尽管存在着极大的阻碍。为了维护“日内瓦精神”，各国人民必须坚决反对新“冷战”鼓吹者的狂妄企图，而把争取和平和加强国际合作事业的斗争坚持进行到底。
