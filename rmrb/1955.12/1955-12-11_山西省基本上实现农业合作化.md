Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th. Shanxi Province has basically achieved agricultural cooperativization. Now, agricultural production cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature have become the basic form of agricultural production in the province. As of the 8th, the province's agricultural production cooperatives have developed to 52,381, with the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 76.6 percent of the total number of peasant households. In thirty counties and the suburbs of two cities, more than 80 percent of peasant households have joined the cooperatives, and in seventeen counties, more than 85 percent of peasant households have joined. It is estimated that by the end of this year, peasant households joining the cooperatives will account for 80 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province.

Since this autumn, more than 17,000 newly built cooperatives throughout the province have been established with the help of older cooperatives. As early as the spring and autumn seasons, more than 31,000 old cooperatives in various regions helped mutual aid teams, which were the targets for establishing cooperatives, to improve their management and cultivate backbone cadres for establishing cooperatives, and transferred more than 15,000 backbone members to the new cooperatives to serve as chairmen, vice-chairmen, accountants, and technicians at the beginning of the establishment of the new cooperatives. Then, they helped the new cooperatives to carry out rectification. The old cooperatives in Yanbei, Xinxian, and Jinnan prefectures alone organized a large number of cooperative establishment guidance groups (teams) and dispatched more than 5,000 cadres to help the new cooperatives carry out rectification. Now, more than 90 percent of the new cooperatives in these areas have evaluated the yield of the land, and some are in the process of evaluation. Many new cooperatives have also formulated winter production plans and implemented a temporary contracting system, and quickly launched production activities.

From mid-December, all parts of the province will fully rectify and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives, and launch a large-scale movement among rural cadres and the broad masses of peasants to study and publicize the "Draft Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives." Each cooperative will also formulate or revise its own regulations in accordance with the draft model regulations. Now, the grassroots party organizations in rural areas are actively establishing and improving the township mutual aid and cooperation committees, summarizing the experience of old cooperatives leading new cooperatives, and preparing to continue to use these organizations and methods to help new cooperatives improve their leadership organizations and labor organizations, formulate production plans for this winter and next year, and correct the implementation of various policies within the cooperatives.

    山西省基本上实现农业合作化
    新华社太原九日电　山西省已经基本上实现了农业合作化。现在，半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社已经成为全省农业生产的基本形式。到八日止，全省农业生产合作社已经发展到五万二千三百八十一个，入社农户占农户总数的百分之七十六点六。有三十个县和两个市的郊区，入社农户已达百分之八十以上，有十七个县入社农户达到百分之八十五以上。预计到今年年底，全省入社农户将占农户总数的百分之八十。
    今年秋季以来，全省新建的一万七千多个社是在老社帮助下建成的。各地的三万一千多个老社早在春、秋两季就通过互助合作网帮助作为建社对象的互助组改善经营管理、培养建社骨干，并且在新社初建的时候，把一万五千多个骨干分子输送到新社担任社长、副社长、会计和技术员。接着又帮助新社进行整顿。仅雁北、忻县、晋南等专区的老社就组织了大量的建社辅导团（组），并且派遣了五千多名干部帮助新社进行整顿。现在，这些地区已经有百分之九十以上的新社评定了土地的产量，有的正在进行评定。许多新社还制定了冬季生产计划和实行了临时包工制度，很快地展开了生产活动。
    从十二月中旬起，全省各地将全力整顿和巩固农业生产合作社，并且在农村干部和广大农民中开展一次大规模的学习和宣传“农业生产合作社示范章程草案”的运动。各个社还要根据示范章程草案制定或修订各个社的社章。现在，各地农村党的基层组织正积极建立、健全乡的互助合作委员会，总结老社带动新社的经验，准备继续运用这些组织和办法，帮助新社健全领导机构和劳动组织，制定今冬和明年的生产计划，端正社内各项政策的执行。
