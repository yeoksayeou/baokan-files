Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 26th: According to reports from Delhi newspapers, Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech at a mass rally in Coimbatore, Madras Province, on December 25th. He elaborated on India's neutral and non-aligned foreign policy in response to the reaction of Western countries to the recent visit of Soviet leaders to India.

Nehru pointed out that some people in Western countries were very angry about the Soviet leaders' visit to India. Nehru said, "Now, people in many parts of the world seem to think that if you are friendly with one person, it means you are hostile to another person and are another person's enemy—as if you can only be friendly with some people in order to be enemies with others." He said, "Friendly regions should not be limited by walls of hostility. This is our view of the country and the international community, and this is the real foundation of India's policy, which is called neutrality or non-alignment."

Nehru also said that India wants to be friendly with all countries, but "our contact with countries that express friendship will be closer than with those that refuse to express friendship."

    尼赫鲁在哥印拜陀群众大会上谈外交政策
    新华社新德里二十六日电　据德里各报报道，印度总理尼赫鲁十二月二十五日在马德拉斯省哥印拜陀城的一个群众大会上发表了演说。他就西方国家对苏联领袖最近访问印度的反应，阐释印度的中立和不参加集团的外交政策。
    尼赫鲁指出，西方国家的某些人士对苏联领袖的访问印度感到非常愤怒。尼赫鲁说，“现在，世界许多地方的人们似乎认为，如果你同一个人友好，那就意味着你同另一个人为敌并且是另一个人的敌人——好像你只能为了要同一些人为敌才同另一些人友好。”他说，“友好的地区不应该为敌对的墙壁所限制。这是我们对国家的和国际的看法，这是印度奉行的被称为中立或不参加联盟的政策的真正基础。”
    尼赫鲁还说，印度要同所有国家友好，但是“我们同表示友好的国家的接触，将比同那些拒绝表示友好的国家来得更加密切一些”。
