Thoroughly Implement the Class Line to Ensure the Quality of Cooperative Construction
    -- A Record of the First Guangdong Provincial District Committee Secretaries Meeting

    At the First Guangdong Provincial District Committee Secretaries Meeting held from November 10th to 23rd, the comrades present focused on studying the issue of thoroughly implementing the class line and ensuring the quality of cooperatives when reviewing the progress of the agricultural collectivization movement in the previous stage.
    Judging from the information reflected by comrades from various regions, a high tide of agricultural collectivization has arrived in Guangdong Province. In just over two months, the number of cooperatives rapidly increased from the previous 15,000 to 50,000, and frameworks for another 50,000 cooperatives have also been set up. The number of peasant households joining cooperatives has also increased from the original 6.7 percent to 40 percent. To date, approximately 3,000 townships in Guangdong Province have formed a high tide of collectivization, with peasant households joining cooperatives accounting for more than 60 percent of the total number of peasant households. More than 6,000 townships of the second category have initially formed a high tide of collectivization, with peasant households joining cooperatives reaching about 40 percent of the total number of peasant households. In the nearly 4,000 townships where work is relatively poor, several cooperatives have also been established in each township, with peasant households joining cooperatives accounting for about 20 percent of the total number of peasant households. Therefore, the meeting believed that the development of this movement was rapid and healthy. Whether viewed from the depth and breadth of cooperative development, or from the effects and influence of the cooperatives, it is unprecedented in the history of Guangdong Province. It has not only changed and is changing the face of the countryside, but has also greatly advanced the work of the entire province.
    However, due to the short time, insufficient preparation, and relatively hasty work, many problems have also arisen. Among these problems, the more prominent and widespread one is the incomplete implementation of the class line, which has affected the quality of the cooperatives.
    In the discussion and review of the implementation of the class line, comrades from various regions believed that the main problems at present are not relying on poor peasants and consciously or unconsciously restricting poor peasants from joining cooperatives. In this regard, representatives from various regions cited many facts. For example, in the Yuebei area, some people said that poor peasants have "three difficulties": "Difficult to cultivate bad land, difficult to plow with thin cattle, and difficult to take care of during famine." In some districts and townships in eastern Guangdong, a lot of strange theories that demeaned poor peasants also appeared. They said that poor peasants "have no culture, are ideologically backward, and cannot lead"; that poor peasants "have no cattle, no money, no production experience, their words are not popular, and no one listens to them." The phenomenon of excluding and not relying on poor peasants is, of course, not just creating public opinion. The deputy secretary of a township branch in Qingyuan County openly put forward "four no's" in developing cooperatives: "Those without labor power are not wanted, those without cattle are not wanted, those who cannot bring shares are not wanted, and those with poor farm tools are not wanted." Some district and township cadres in Nanhai County were unwilling to pass in front of the doors of poor peasants, because they were afraid that the poor peasants would request to join the cooperative. When the Meihua Cooperative in Lianping County, Yuebei District, was organizing production teams, no one wanted a poor peasant household with relatively difficult lives, and finally they had to use a lottery method to solve the problem.
    The comrades present unanimously pointed out: Although some people have created various fallacies to restrict poor peasants from joining cooperatives; however, the enthusiasm of poor peasants to join cooperatives is still very high. In some villages and towns in the Yuebei area, some poor peasants brought bedding and slept in the township government office waiting to sign up. Some were afraid that one cooperative would not approve them, so they registered in five cooperatives in a row. In Lingtou Village, Fucheng Township, Wengyuan County, three poor peasant households, because they had not joined the cooperative, did whatever the cooperative did. When the cooperative accumulated fertilizer, they piled their own accumulated fertilizer with the cooperative's, and said repeatedly, "We must join the cooperative no matter what." The poor peasants in Guihua Township, Lianshan County, saw the township cadres going to the county to attend the collectivization training class, so they automatically elected seven representatives and brought their own food to receive training. The poor peasants in this township questioned the township head who did not allow them to join the cooperative, saying, "We are neither counter-revolutionaries, nor landlords or rich peasants, and our ancestors for three generations have been innocent. Why aren't we allowed to join the cooperative?"
    In those places where "poor peasants are not good" theories were created, the phenomenon of forcibly pulling middle peasants into cooperatives also appeared at the same time.
    The meeting analyzed the objective reasons and ideological roots of this error. From an objective point of view, the reason for this phenomenon is the insufficient ideological preparation before the movement. Since Comrade Mao Zedong made a report on July 31st, the Provincial Party Committee convened an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee in August, and the Second Provincial Party Congress in September. Before and after these two meetings, the district party committees, prefectural party committees, and county party committees also successively convened a series of meetings. These meetings made sharp criticisms of the right-leaning thoughts in the agricultural collectivization movement, thus setting off a province-wide collectivization upsurge. However, at these meetings, it was not well resolved who should be relied on, who should be united, and who should be the target of the struggle in running cooperatives. At the same time, the comprehensive planning and class planning of the cooperatives were not arranged in a specific and timely manner, and many places were "making up lessons" afterwards. This is one of the reasons for not relying on poor peasants well.
    Another reason, and the most fundamental reason, is that some party members have developed capitalist ideas after their economic status has risen. For example, in Changpu Township, Qingyuan County, there were 23 party members, originally only three party members were of middle peasant origin, and the rest were of poor peasant origin. Now, among the 20 party members of poor peasant origin, 16 have risen to the economic status of middle peasants. Changes in economic status cannot but cause changes in thinking. In places where the party's education is relatively good, the ideological situation of party members is relatively normal; in places where the party's education is relatively poor, a bad phenomenon has appeared in which some party members want to take the capitalist road. Labor Hua Dong, a party member of Lianzhou Township, Fourth District, Nanhai County, worked as a long-term laborer for seven or eight years before the land reform and lived a very hard life. He was assigned ten mu of land during the land reform and became the township head. In 1953, when the party called for the organization of mutual aid teams, he took the lead in establishing a year-round mutual aid team. Due to his promotion and influence, 36 mutual aid teams soon appeared in the township. But after living a better life in the past two years, he took the lead in disbanding, causing more than half of the mutual aid teams in the township to collapse. In this collectivization movement, he was not only not interested in the enthusiasm of the masses to join the cooperative, but also expressed his desire to withdraw from the party. He said, "If you join the party, you have to join the cooperative. Joining the party was a mistake." Although there are not many party members like Labor Hua Dong, they are not unique. According to the report of the Yuebei District Party Committee, in recent years, the family economic status of county and district cadres has also risen rapidly. They once investigated the county committees and district committees of twelve counties and found that among these county committee and district committee cadres, those with family exploitation accounted for 10 percent. The family of Cheng Laifeng, deputy secretary of the Lian County County Party Committee, rented out six cattle and three mu of land, becoming a new rich peasant who exploited peasants. When the district cadres suggested that he mobilize his family to join the cooperative last year, he said, "My family has no labor power, and joining the cooperative will reduce income. It is not appropriate to join the cooperative now." Facts have proved that the reason why so many phenomena of not relying on poor peasants and excluding poor peasants have occurred in many places, and why so many phenomena of forcibly pulling middle peasants and even appearing "middle peasant cooperatives" have occurred, is inseparable from the capitalist ideas of many party members and cadres.
    Yes, in the later period of the collectivization movement, after emphasizing relying on poor peasants, establishing poor peasant backbones and poor peasant leadership, individual places also produced the phenomenon of not wanting middle peasants and excluding middle peasants. Although this situation is not common, it is also an incomplete manifestation of implementing the class line, and it is the result of certain cadres going too far in proving their strong poor peasant viewpoint and leaning to the other side.
    In the later period of this movement, the party committees of various places made some criticisms of the tendency to exclude poor peasants and forcibly pull middle peasants, and adjusted some cooperatives that did not seriously implement the class line. From the surface, the problem is not big. But in fact, the leadership of many cooperatives is still controlled, openly or secretly, by upper-middle peasants. In order to ensure the advantage of poor peasants, the meeting decided to conduct a general inspection of the established cooperatives to correct the errors in the implementation of the class line in a timely manner. At the same time, in the newly built cooperatives, about 10 percent of the people (upper-middle peasants) are emotionally uneasy and ideologically unstable. For these people, if they request to withdraw from the cooperative, they can be allowed, or they can be allowed to register temporarily and join the cooperative later.
    Secondly, the principle of mutual benefit is not well implemented in the newly built cooperatives. In some places, the interests of poor peasants are not taken care of, and the yield of poor peasants' land is assessed too low; and in some places, the yield of middle peasants is assessed too low. Both of these situations are wrong and should be reassessed. For other means of production, unreasonable assessments should also be reassessed. At the same time, the newly built cooperatives should shift to production and formulate production plans.
    In the early stage of this movement, Guangdong and other places successively carried out party rectification and party building work. Facts have proved that the development and consolidation of cooperatives are inseparable from the quality of party work. In villages and towns where the party rectification work is well done, the development of cooperatives is particularly healthy. In places where party rectification has not been carried out, or where party rectification is not thorough, the development of cooperatives is slow and there are many problems. The previous period of party rectification was generally not thorough enough, and the capitalist ideas of party members were not thoroughly criticized. Some problems were not dealt with; some were hastily rectified, and many problems were not resolved. This meeting pointed out that party rectification should be continued in places where party rectification is not thorough; places where problems have not been dealt with should be dealt with quickly. In party rectification, the main focus should be on the capitalist ideas of rich peasants. In the process of cooperative planning, various places should also do a good job of developing party plans, and strive to establish party branches in all villages and towns within a year in order to lead the collectivization movement to continue to move forward.
    In the process of the great development of cooperatives, some landlords, rich peasants or other counter-revolutionary elements have sneaked in, and they have carried out rampant sabotage activities against the collectivization movement. According to statistics from eastern Guangdong, eleven murder cases were discovered in just September and October. Therefore, while consolidating the work of the cooperatives, it is necessary to resolutely clean out those landlords and rich peasant elements who have sneaked in, and give a devastating blow to the counter-revolutionary elements who are sabotaging the collectivization movement.

    贯彻执行阶级路线，保证建社质量
    ——记广东省第一次区委书记会议
    林里
    十一月十日到二十三日召开的广东省的第一次区委书记会议上，在检查前一阶段农业合作化运动的情况的时候，到会的同志着重研究了贯彻执行阶级路线，保证合作社的质量的问题。
    从各地同志反映的情况来看，广东省的农业合作化高潮已经到来。在短短两个多月的时间里，合作社由以前的一万五千个，迅速地发展到了五万个，同时又搭起了五万个社的架子。入社农户也由原来的百分之六点七，发展到了百分之四十。到目前为止，广东省已有约三千个乡形成了合作化的高潮，入社农户占总农户的百分之六十以上，预计明年春天以前可以基本合作化。次一类的乡有六千多个，已初步形成了合作化高潮，入社农户达总农户的百分之四十左右。工作较差的近四千个乡，每个乡内也已建立了好几个社，入社农户约占总农户的百分之二十左右。因此，会议认为这次运动的发展是迅速的、健康的。不论就合作社发展的深度和广度来看，也不论就合作社的效果和影响来说，在广东省的历史上都是空前的。它不仅改变了和改变着农村的面貌，而且把全省的工作大大推进了一步。
    但是，由于时间短促，准备不够，工作比较草率，因而也带来了许多问题。这些问题当中比较突出、也比较普遍的是贯彻执行阶级路线不全面，因而影响到合作社质量的问题。
    在关于贯彻执行阶级路线的讨论和检查中，各地同志认为，目前主要问题是不依靠贫农，以及自觉或不自觉地限制贫农入社。在这方面，各地代表都列举了许多事实。比如在粤北地区，就有些人说贫农有“三难”：“地坏耕作难、牛瘦犁耙难、度荒照顾难”。粤东地区的某些区乡，也出现了一大堆贬低贫农的怪论。说贫农“没有文化、思想落后、不能领导”；说贫农“没牛、没钱、没生产经验，说话不吃香，没有人听”。排斥贫农和不依靠贫农的现象，当然不光是制造舆论而已。清远县有一个乡的支部副书记，在发展合作社中公开提出“四不要”：“没有劳动力的不要，没有耕牛的不要，不能带股金的不要，农具不好的不要。”南海县有些区乡干部，走路都不愿从贫农的门前过，原因是怕贫农提出入社的要求。粤北区连平县梅花社在编生产队的时候，有一户生活比较困难的贫农，谁也不要，最后不得不用抽签的方法来解决。
    到会的同志们一致指出：尽管有些人制造了这样或那样的谬论，限制贫农入社；但是，贫农的入社积极性还是很高的。粤北区一些乡村，有些贫农带上铺盖，睡在乡政府办公的地方等待报名。有的怕一个社批不准，就一连在五个社挂号。翁源县附城乡岭头村有三户贫农，因为没有入社，他们见合作社做什么，自己也就做什么。合作社积肥，他们就把自己积的肥，跟合作社的堆在一起，并口口声声地说：“无论如何要入社。”连山县桂花乡的贫农，看见乡干部到县里去参加合作化训练班，他们便自动地推选了七个代表，自己带上口粮去受训。这个乡的贫农质问不让他们参加合作社的乡长说：“我们一不是反革命，二不是地主富农，三来，我们的祖宗三代都清白，为什么不准我们入社？”
    在那些制造“贫农不好”的舆论的地方，也就同时出现了强拉中农入社的现象。
    会议分析了造成这一错误的客观原因和思想根源。从客观上来看，发生这种现象的原因是运动前的思想准备不足。自从毛泽东同志在七月三十一日作报告后，省委在八月间召开了省委扩大会，九月间召开了全省党的第二次代表会议。在这两个会议的前后，各区党委、地委和县委，也都先后召开了一连串的会议。这些会议，都针对农业合作化运动中的右倾思想，做了尖锐的批判，因而掀起了全省性的合作化高潮。但是，在这些会议上，对于办合作社应该依靠谁，团结谁，斗争锋芒朝着谁，则没有很好解决。同时，对于合作社的全面规划和阶级规划，也都布置得不具体、不及时，许多地方是在事后“补课”的。这是没有很好依靠贫农的原因之一。
    另一个原因，也是最根本的原因，就是由于一些党员经济地位上升以后，滋长了资本主义的思想。比如清远县长埔乡，有二十三个党员，原来只有三个党员是中农成份，其余的都是贫农成份。现在二十个贫农成份的党员当中，已有十六个上升到中农的经济地位。经济地位的变化，就不能不引起思想上的变化。在党的教育比较好的地方，党员的思想情况比较正常；在党的教育比较差的地方，就出现了一部分党员想走资本主义道路的坏现象。南海县四区联州乡党员劳华东，土地改革前当了七、八年长工，生活很苦。土地改革中分了十亩田，当了乡长。一九五三年党号召组织互助组，他带头成立了一个常年互助组。由于他的推动和影响，全乡随即出现了三十六个互助组。但在这两年生活好了以后，他就带头散伙，致使全乡的互助组一半以上垮台。这次合作化运动中，他不但对群众的入社热情不感兴趣，反而表示要退党。他说：“入了党，不入社不行，入党入错了。”像劳华东这样的党员，虽然不多，但也不是独一无二的。据粤北区党委报告，这几年来，县区干部的家庭经济地位上升也是很快的，他们曾经调查了十二个县的县委和区委，发现这些县委和区委干部当中，家庭有剥削行为的占百分之十。连县县委副书记成来凤的家里，就把六条耕牛、三亩土地拿去出租，变成了剥削农民的新富农。去年办社的时候，区干部建议他动员家庭入社，他说：“我家没有劳动力，入社会减少收入。现在入社不适当。”事实证明，许多地方所以发生那么多不依靠贫农以及排斥贫农的现象，所以发生强拉中农，以致出现不少“中农社”的现象，是和许多党员、干部资本主义思想作怪分不开的。
    是的，在合作化运动的后期，在强调依靠贫农、树立贫农骨干和贫农领导以后，个别地方也产生不要中农和排斥中农的现象。这种情况虽然不多，但也是贯彻执行阶级路线不全面的表现，是某些干部为了证明自己贫农观点强而偏到另一方面去的结果。
    在这次运动的后期，各地党委对于排斥贫农，强拉中农的倾向都做了一些批判，对于一些没有认真贯彻执行阶级路线的社做了调整，从表面上来看，问题不大了。但实际上，仍有不少社的领导权，或明或暗地操纵在上中农手里。为了确保贫农优势，会议决定对已建成的合作社进行一次普遍的检查，及时纠正执行阶级路线中的错误。同时，在新建社中，有大约百分之十的人（上中农）情绪不安，思想不稳。对于这些人，他们若要求退社，可以允许，也可以允许暂时挂号，以后入社。
    其次，新建社中互利原则执行得不好，有的地方没有照顾贫农利益，把贫农土地的产量评低了；又有的地方过低评定了中农的产量。这两种情况都是不对的，应该重新评定。对于其他生产资料，评得不合理的也应该重新评定。同时，新建社应该转向生产，拟定生产规划。
    在这次运动的初期，广东各地都先后开展了整党和建党工作。事实证明，合作社的发展和巩固，跟党的工作好坏是分不开的。凡是整党工作搞得好的乡村，合作社的发展就特别健康。没有整党，或整党不彻底的地方，合作社的发展就慢，问题就多。前一个时期的整党，一般整得不够彻底，党员的资本主义思想，没有得到彻底的批判。有的问题没做处理；有的草草整过，许多问题没有解决。这次会议指出，对于整党不彻底的地方，应该继续整党；问题没有处理的地方，要迅速处理。在整党中，主要锋芒应当针对富农资本主义思想。在合作社规划过程中，各地也应该把发展党的规划做好，争取在一年当中在所有的乡村建立起党的支部，以便领导合作化运动继续前进。
    在合作社大发展的过程中，有些地方混进了一些地主、富农或其他反革命分子，他们对合作化运动进行猖狂的破坏活动。据粤东地区统计，仅在九、十两个月内，就发现了十一起谋杀案件。因此，在巩固合作社工作的同时，必须坚决把那些混进来的地主、富农分子清洗出去，给破坏合作化运动的反革命分子以毁灭性的打击。
