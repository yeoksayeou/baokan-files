Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 20th. A rally of more than 800 people from all walks of life in Pyongyang was held on the evening of the 19th at the Moranbong Theater to welcome the German Democratic Republic government delegation headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl.

When Prime Minister Grotewohl and all members of the delegation appeared on the rostrum, accompanied by Kim Il-sung, Marshal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Premier of the Cabinet, and Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, the hall resounded with stormy applause.

Present at the rally were Korean Deputy Premiers of the Cabinet Choe Yong-gon, Park Chang-ok, Kim Il, Choe Chang-ik, Hong Myung-hui, and Park Ui-wan, Deputy Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Park Jung-ai and Park Kum-chul, leaders of various social organizations, cadres of the People's Army, figures from science, culture, and the arts, and representatives of the working people of Pyongyang.

Chinese Ambassador to Korea Pan Zili and diplomatic envoys of various countries to Korea were also invited to attend the rally. German Democratic Republic technical personnel assisting Korea were also present.

Kim Il-sung spoke at the rally. He first welcomed the German Democratic Republic government delegation in the name of the Korean people and the government of the Republic. He then described the great achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in peaceful construction since its founding. He said, "The Korean people deeply understand, based on their own situation, the wishes and efforts of the fraternal German people to achieve the unification of their motherland by peaceful means on a democratic basis. The Korean people fully support and endorse the German Democratic Republic government's policies and measures on German unification, as well as the Soviet Union's proposals on the German question in international talks."

Kim Il-sung then described the assistance given by the German Democratic Republic to the Korean people during the Korean War and after the war. He said that thanks to the assistance of the German Democratic Republic government and people, the restored city of Hamhung will become a symbol of the immortal friendship between the peoples of Korea and Germany. The Korean people will never forget the assistance given to us by the German people and the people of all brotherly countries. He concluded by saying that the visit of the German Democratic Republic delegation to Korea will further consolidate and develop the friendship and cooperative relations between the peoples of Korea and Germany, and will contribute to the cause of world peace.

He said: "The peace-loving German people regard their contribution to the restoration of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as their duty. We assure you that we will continue to fulfill this obligation to the Korean people." He also said: "I am very familiar with the many proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the South Korean government regarding mutual exchange and peaceful contact. These proposals, like the many proposals made by the German Democratic Republic to the West German government, have been rejected. However, we will make every effort to achieve this goal until the day of victory. The Korean issue cannot be resolved without the participation of the Korean people, and the German issue cannot be resolved without the participation of the German people."

The rally concluded with the orchestra playing the national anthems of the two countries.

    平壤盛会欢迎民主德国代表团
    新华社平壤二十日电　平壤市各界人士八百多人十九日晚在牡丹峰剧场举行大会，欢迎以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团。
    当格罗提渥总理和代表团全体团员在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成元帅、朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉等陪同下出现在主席台上时，会场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    出席大会的有朝鲜内阁副首相崔庸健、朴昌玉、金一、崔昌益、洪命熹、朴义琓，劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴金喆等党和政府的领导人，各社会团体负责人，人民军干部，科学、文化、艺术界人士，平壤市劳动人民代表等。
    中国驻朝鲜大使潘自力和各国驻朝鲜外交使节也应邀出席了大会。出席大会的还有德意志民主共和国援朝技术人员。
    金日成在大会上讲了话。他首先以朝鲜人民和共和国政府的名义向德意志民主共和国政府代表团表示欢迎。他接着叙述了德意志民主共和国创建以后在和平建设中取得的巨大成果。他说：“朝鲜人民根据自己的处境深切地理解到兄弟般的德国人民为了在民主的基础上用和平方法达成他们祖国的统一所表示的意愿和进行的努力。朝鲜人民完全支持和赞同德意志民主共和国政府对德国统一的各项政策和措施，以及在国际会谈中苏联就德国问题所提出的各项提案。”
    金日成接着叙述了德意志民主共和国在朝鲜战争时期和战后给予朝鲜人民援助的情形。他说，由于德意志民主共和国政府和人民的援助得到恢复建设的咸兴市将成为朝德两国人民之间的不朽的友谊的象征。朝鲜人民将永远不会忘记德国人民和各兄弟国家人民给予我们的援助。他最后说，德意志民主共和国代表团这次访问朝鲜，将进一步巩固和发展朝德两国人民之间的友谊和合作关系，并且有助于世界和平事业。
    格罗提渥总理接着在大会上讲话。他首先向光荣的平壤市民和朝鲜人民转达皮克总统和德意志民主共和国政府、爱好和平的德国人民的祝贺。他指出，在第二次世界大战后，德国和朝鲜之间有着很多共同的地方。他说：“爱好和平的德国人民把自己对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国恢复事业中所作的贡献看作是自己的义务。我们向你们保证，我们对朝鲜人民的这种义务要继续履行下去。”他又说：“我很熟悉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国对南朝鲜政府提出的许多关于互通往来、和平接触的方案，这些提议同德意志民主共和国给西德政府的许多提议一样遭到了拒绝。但是，我们为了达到这一目的，要作一切的努力，一直到取得胜利的那一天为止。朝鲜问题没有朝鲜人民参加是不能得到解决的，德国问题没有德国人民参加也是不能得到解决的。”
    大会最后在乐队奏两国国歌声中结束。
