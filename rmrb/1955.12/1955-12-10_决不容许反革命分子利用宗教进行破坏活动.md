The Shanghai Public Security organs, with the demands and assistance of the broad masses of people and patriotic religious believers, have uncovered a counter-revolutionary group that had been hiding within the Catholic Church for a long time. The head of this counter-revolutionary group was named Gong Pinmei. This was a counter-revolutionary group under the command of foreign imperialist elements, wearing the cloak of religion. This counter-revolutionary group directed counter-revolutionaries lurking in the Catholic Church in Shanghai and other places to carry out a series of counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. Resolutely suppressing these counter-revolutionaries who are willing to be loyal to imperialism and betray the motherland is entirely in the interests of the people of the whole country. The people of the whole country, patriotic religious believers, and clergy have expressed warm support for this correct measure.

In order to sabotage the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation that our people are undertaking, the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group blatantly proposed that "loving the Church means not loving the country" and "believers cannot love the country led by the Communist Party." They used "divine authority" as a pretext to prohibit believers from participating in the movement to defend world peace, and prohibited believers from fulfilling the obligations that citizens of the People's Republic of China should fulfill: not allowing believers to serve in the military, not allowing believers to participate in socialist construction, not allowing believers to participate in anti-imperialist patriotic movements, not allowing believers to report counter-revolutionaries, and not allowing believers to respond to all the government's calls and participate in all the meetings convened by the government. They openly believed that "loving the country is a crime." Believers and patriotic clergy who participated in the above activities were considered "anti-Church" and "schismatic," and were threatened and persecuted by means of suspending "spiritual merits," not giving "holy communion," stripping "divine authority," and "excommunication." They went to extremes to sabotage all the state's policies and all major measures. During the land reform period, they prevented believers from dividing the land of landlords; during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, they did not allow believers to join the Volunteer Army; during the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, they hid many counter-revolutionaries in churches and prevented believers from reporting them; after the general task of the state's transition period was put forward, they used the so-called "heaven as the basic line" to oppose the general line. It can be seen that they held a completely "irreconcilable" attitude towards the country and the people. What exactly were they praying for? What they were praying for was the subversion of the new China, a "Third World War," and the death and destruction of mankind! What they dreamed of day and night was the restoration of the bloody rule of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in China.

The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group, loyal to imperialism, also systematically organized counter-revolutionaries to carry out criminal activities to subvert the people's regime. They established counter-revolutionary organizations such as the "Divine Eagle Party," the "China Juvenile Anti-Communist Comrades Revolutionary Committee," and the "National Salvation Revolutionary Party." These counter-revolutionary organizations also put forward counter-revolutionary programs to cooperate with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in carrying out restoration. The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group hid many guns, ammunition, and other murderous weapons in churches. They extensively deployed intelligence networks, collecting information on our political, economic, military, and cultural aspects. They often sent out henchmen, disguised as merchants and students, to secretly carry out sabotage activities in various places, and bought off and utilized some bad elements mixed in our organs, schools, factories, mines, enterprises, and people's organizations to carry out the crime of spying on intelligence and stealing our internal secrets for them. What they did was entirely criminal activity to subvert the people's regime.

The crimes of these counter-revolutionaries not only harm the interests of the broad masses of people, but also insult religion and harm the interests of all patriotic religious believers and clergy. Under their threats and persecution, many believers and clergy lost the freedom to engage in legitimate religious activities. They could not only not participate in any beneficial social activities, but even reading newspapers and books, watching movies, and communicating with patriotic religious believers were interfered with. They even dared to set up private prisons inside the church, arbitrarily and secretly imprisoning believers, turning the church into a hell on earth for good believers. They were too rampant, daring to do such dark and sinister things in the free land of the People's Republic of China!

Our Constitution stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have freedom of religious belief." However, we must never allow imperialist special agents and counter-revolutionaries to use the people's government's religious policy to engage in subversive activities in our sacred territory. In order to defend our great socialist construction and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, we must resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, no matter which corner they are hiding in, no matter what cloak they are wearing, and no matter how cleverly they are disguised. The actions of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group have long had nothing to do with religious belief. All religious believers and clergy should learn to identify who are the real religious believers and who are the counter-revolutionaries, and should not be deceived by the evil wolves disguised as "grandmothers."

The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group spread reactionary remarks such as "loving the Church means not loving the country" among believers. They attempted to set loving the Church against loving the country, and to provoke and undermine the unity between our people and between the people and their government. We know that "defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China," and religious believers are of course no exception. All true religious believers in China know that although there are people of various beliefs in our country, we are all Chinese. Every believer should also become a citizen who loves the motherland, constantly improves their patriotic awareness, voluntarily and consciously fulfills the obligations that citizens should fulfill, abides by government laws and regulations, responds to government calls, enthusiastically participates in patriotic activities, and strives for the country's construction and the defense of world peace. Therefore, all true religious believers in China cannot tolerate any counter-revolutionaries using religion to carry out sabotage activities against the motherland.

The people's government's policy of resolutely suppressing those counter-revolutionaries wearing the cloak of religion does not hinder people's freedom of religious belief in the slightest. It is precisely Gong Pinmei and these counter-revolutionaries who are undermining religious belief. Only by thoroughly eliminating these counter-revolutionaries can normal religious life be guaranteed. The fact that patriotic righteousness has been further promoted and religious life has become more active among the Catholics in Shanghai after the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group was crushed is a good illustration. We believe that the broad masses of Catholics are patriotic and hope that the Church will be pure; counter-revolutionaries are only a very small number, and their use of the Church to carry out sabotage activities is against the will of the broad masses of believers. Therefore, all patriotic believers should learn from past lessons, distinguish right from wrong, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, resolutely stand with the people of the whole country, expose counter-revolutionaries in the Church who collude with imperialism to carry out sabotage activities, and oppose imperialism using religion to sabotage the Chinese people's revolutionary cause. Religious believers are religious believers, and counter-revolutionaries are counter-revolutionaries. These are distinctly different and completely different. Counter-revolutionaries wearing the cloak of religion have nothing to do with people who truly believe in religion. Those who have been deceived and utilized and have mistakenly participated in the activities of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group should wake up as soon as possible, return to the people's side, and thoroughly confess their problems. As long as they can do this, they will certainly be welcomed by the people. We know that there are still some counter-revolutionaries hiding in the Catholic Church who have not confessed their sins to the government, and some are still openly or secretly carrying out sabotage activities, adopting two-faced methods, hoping to resist and muddle through, and even secretly obstructing believers' reports. We warn these counter-revolutionaries: all your stubborn resistance and cunning methods will not help in any way other than adding to your crimes! The people's government's policy for dealing with counter-revolutionaries is: "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, meritorious service will offset demerits, and great meritorious service will be rewarded." Only a thorough confession and repentance can lead to a way out.

The exposure of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group is a major blow to imperialism and its running dogs who use the Church as cover to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. However, imperialism and its running dogs will never abandon their sabotage schemes because of their failure. Therefore, the people of the whole country and the broad masses of patriotic religious believers must continue to raise their awareness, draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, stand on the patriotic position, and, in order to safeguard the interests of the motherland and the people, unite as one, actively participate in the struggle to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries, and completely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

    决不容许反革命分子利用宗教进行破坏活动
    上海市人民公安机关在广大人民群众和爱国教徒的要求和协助之下，破获了一个长期隐藏在天主教内的反革命集团。这个反革命集团的头子名叫龚品梅。这是一个在国外帝国主义分子的指挥下披着宗教外衣的反革命集团。这个反革命集团指挥着潜藏在上海和各地天主教内的反革命分子，进行了一系列的反革命破坏活动。坚决镇压这伙甘愿效忠于帝国主义的背叛祖国的反革命分子，是完全符合全国人民利益的。全国人民和爱国教徒及神职人员对于这一正确措施表示了热烈的拥护。
    龚品梅反革命集团为了破坏我国人民正在进行的伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业，明目张胆地提出“爱教就不能爱国”，“教徒不能爱共产党领导的国家”。他们假借“神权”禁止教徒参加保卫世界和平的运动，禁止教徒履行中华人民共和国公民所应当履行的义务：不许教徒服兵役，不许教徒参加社会主义建设，不许教徒参加反帝爱国运动，不许教徒检举反革命分子，不许教徒响应人民政府的一切号召和参加人民政府所召开的一切会议。他们公然认为“爱国有罪”，凡是参加上述活动的教徒和爱国神职人员都被认为是“反教”、“裂教”，而以停止“神功”、不给领“圣体”、摘“神权”和“弃绝”等手段加以威胁和迫害。他们对于国家的一切政策和一切重大的措施无所不用其极地进行破坏。在土地改革时期，他们阻止教徒分地主的土地；在抗美援朝时期，不让教徒参加志愿军；在镇压反革命运动中，他们把许多反革命分子窝藏在教堂内，并且阻止教徒检举；在国家过渡时期总任务提出以后，他们以所谓“天堂为基本路线”来和总路线相对抗。可见他们对国家和人民完全抱着“誓不两立”的态度。他们所祈求的究竟是什么呢？他们所祈求的是颠覆新中国，是“第三次世界大战”，是人类的死亡和毁灭！他们日夜所梦想的是帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的血腥统治在中国的复辟。
    效忠于帝国主义的龚品梅反革命集团还有计划地把反革命分子组织起来进行颠覆人民政权的罪恶活动。他们建立了“神鹰党”、“中国少年反共同志革命委员会”、“救国革命党”等反革命组织。这些反革命组织还提出了配合帝国主义和蒋匪帮进行复辟的反革命纲领。龚品梅反革命集团把许多枪枝、弹药及其他杀人武器隐藏在教堂内，他们广泛地布置情报网，搜集我政治、经济、军事、文化等各方面的情报。他们经常派出爪牙，化装成商人、学生，潜赴各地秘密进行破坏活动，并且收买利用混在我机关、学校、工矿、企业及人民团体内部的一些坏分子，为他们进行刺探情报和窃取我内部机密的罪行。他们所干的完全是颠覆人民政权的罪恶勾当。
    这些反革命分子的罪行，不仅危害广大人民的利益，而且也污辱宗教，危害一切爱国的教徒和神职人员的利益。许多教徒和神职人员在他们的威胁和迫害下，失去了从事正当宗教活动的自由，不仅不能参加任何有益的社会活动，甚至阅读书报、看电影以及同爱国教徒间的来往都受到干涉。他们竟敢在教会内部私设监狱，任意秘密囚禁教徒，把教会变成善良教徒的人间地狱。他们是太猖狂了，竟敢在中华人民共和国的自由的土地上干这样暗无天日的勾当！
    我国宪法规定：“中华人民共和国公民有宗教信仰的自由。”但是我们决不能允许帝国主义特务间谍和反革命分子利用人民政府的宗教政策在我们神圣的国土上从事颠覆活动。为了保卫我们伟大的社会主义建设，巩固人民民主专政，必须坚决、彻底、干净、全部肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，不论他们暗藏在哪个角落，不论他们披着什么外衣，伪装得多么巧妙。龚品梅反革命集团的所作所为，早已和宗教信仰没有什么相干的了。一切教徒和神职人员应当学会识别哪些是真正的宗教信仰者，哪些是反革命分子，不要被那些化装成“外婆”的恶狼所欺骗。
    龚品梅反革命集团在教徒中散布所谓“爱教就不能爱国”等反动言论。他们企图把爱教和爱国对立起来，挑拨、破坏我国人民之间的和人民同自己的政府之间的团结。我们知道：“保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责”，教徒当然也不能例外。中国的一切真正的宗教信仰者都知道，在我们的国家内虽然有各种不同信仰的人，但我们都是中国人。每一个教徒应当同时成为一个热爱祖国的公民，不断提高爱国主义觉悟，自愿自觉地尽公民应尽的义务，遵守政府的法令，响应政府的号召，热烈参加爱国活动，为祖国建设和保卫世界和平而尽力。因此，中国的一切真正宗教信仰者是不能容忍任何反革命分子利用宗教对祖国进行破坏活动的。
    人民政府对于那些披着宗教外衣的反革命分子采取坚决镇压的政策：这丝毫不妨碍人们的宗教信仰自由。破坏宗教信仰的正是龚品梅这些反革命分子，只有把这些反革命分子彻底清除，正常的宗教生活才能得到保证。上海的天主教徒在龚品梅反革命集团被粉碎以后，爱国正气得到进一步发扬，宗教生活更加活跃起来，就是一个很好的说明。我们相信广大的天主教徒都是爱国的，是希望教会纯洁的；反革命分子只是极少数，他们利用教会进行破坏活动是违反广大教徒的意志的，因此一切有爱国心的教徒应当接受以往的教训，辨明是非，分清敌我，坚决同全国人民站在一起，揭露教会中跟帝国主义勾结进行破坏活动的反革命分子，反对帝国主义利用宗教破坏中国人民革命事业。信教的人就是信教的人，反革命就是反革命，这是界限分明截然不同的。披着宗教外衣的反革命分子和真正信仰宗教的人士是毫不相干的。那些被欺骗利用而误入歧途参加了龚品梅反革命集团活动的人，应当及早觉悟，回到人民方面来，彻底交代自己的问题。只要他们能够这样做，一定可以得到人民的欢迎。我们知道，至今还有一些暗藏在天主教中的反革命分子没有向政府坦白悔过，有的还在公开地或秘密地进行破坏活动，采取两面的方法，希图抗拒和蒙混过关，甚至在暗中阻挠教徒的检举。我们警告这些反革命分子：你们的一切顽抗和狡猾办法，除了加重你们的罪恶以外，是没有任何用处的！人民政府处理反革命分子的政策是：“坦白从宽，抗拒从严，立功者将功折罪，立大功者受奖”，只有彻底坦白悔改才有出路。
    龚品梅反革命集团的被揭露，是对于帝国主义及其走狗们利用教会为掩护进行反革命活动的一大打击。但是帝国主义及其走狗们决不会因为他们的失败而放弃其破坏阴谋。因此，全国人民和广大爱国教徒还要继续提高觉悟，划清敌我界限，站在爱国的立场，为维护祖国和人民的利益，团结一致，积极参加肃清暗藏反革命分子的斗争，把一切暗藏的反革命分子全部肃清。
