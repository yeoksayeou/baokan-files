Regarding the French General Election

The French National Assembly election, held every five years, is scheduled for January 2nd next year.

As everyone knows, the various bourgeois parties in France have recently engaged in fierce struggles over the issue of the electoral system. Due to the irreconcilable contradictions between them, the National Assembly overthrew the Faure government, which then invoked the constitution to dissolve the parliament and decided to hold early elections.

Why have the various bourgeois parties in France engaged in such fierce struggles over the election issue? This is because these parties, due to their pursuit of anti-national and anti-people policies, dare not face the French people. They hope to rely on an undemocratic electoral system to hold elections, so as to exclude the true representatives of the French people—the French Communist Party—from the parliament and ensure that they steal more seats. Although these parties are the same in trying to exclude the Communist Party, they each have their own plans and want to grab more seats for their own groups, so they cannot help but have contradictions and conflicts with each other.

Before the last general election, the French ruling clique spent two years planning to abolish the relatively democratic proportional representation system (where seats are distributed according to the proportion of votes obtained by each party) and replace it with an anti-democratic electoral system. More than twenty electoral systems were successively rejected in the parliament, and a government crisis was triggered, before a single-ballot majority voting system that facilitated the formation of alliances by various right-wing parties to oppose the Communist Party was barely passed. They relied on this system to seize eighty seats from the French Communist Party. However, due to its close ties with the masses, the French Communist Party still maintained more than one hundred seats under very unfavorable conditions, making it one of the largest parties in the parliament.

After the Faure government put forward the request to hold early elections in October this year, the struggle to revise the electoral system occurred again. Various electoral systems were proposed and overturned in the parliament, also about twenty times in total. In the end, the issue of revising the electoral system was not resolved. The Faure government dissolved the parliament before a new electoral system was formulated, so the election will still be held according to the original electoral system—the single-ballot majority voting system. The main feature of this electoral system is that it allows various parties in France to form groups to participate in the election. As long as the group obtains more than 50 percent of the total votes in a province, it can exclusively occupy all the seats belonging to that province, and then the parties forming this alliance will distribute these seats themselves. A party participating in this group can get a seat as long as it obtains 5 percent of the total votes. Other parties, even if they obtain 49 percent of the total votes, will not get a single seat. Only when no party or party group obtains more than half of the votes, the seats are distributed according to the proportion of votes obtained by each party. This provision is to facilitate the reactionary parties in France to form alliances in the election, rely on the power of unity to resist the powerful progressive forces, and steal seats in the parliament. The result of the election held in 1951 according to this electoral law was that the Republican Anti-Fascist Alliance, headed by the French Communist Party, obtained more than five million votes in the election, but only got one hundred and three seats. However, the Rally of the French People, which obtained about one million fewer votes than the Communist Party, got one hundred and eighteen seats, and even the Socialist Party, which obtained only slightly more than half of the Communist Party's votes (2.7 million votes), got one more seat than the Communist Party. The anti-democratic and unfairness of this electoral system is obvious.

The French Communist Party has always opposed this anti-democratic system of electoral alliances. It has resolutely fought in the parliament to abolish this undemocratic electoral system. Recently, it also called on all progressive forces to unite in order to give the right-wing groups a heavy blow under the condition that this system has not been abolished. The French Communist Party's call has been enthusiastically responded to by the broad masses of Socialist Party members. This can be proved by the following event: when the National Committee of the Socialist Party voted on the issue of whether to form a joint election with the Communist Party on December 6, as many as 1,243 votes were in favor of an alliance with the Communist Party, accounting for nearly two-fifths of the total votes. In addition, left-wing Radical Socialists, the "New Left Alliance," the Progressive Republican Union, and the Young Republican Party all responded to the Communist Party's call.

At present, right-wing politicians in France are trying to use various methods to prevent their party members and local party organizations from acting in unison with the Communists. The right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party forced the National Committee of the party to pass a resolution prohibiting the party's local organizations from forming electoral alliances with the Communist Party. However, even the orders of the Socialist Party's leading organs cannot stop the local organizations and party members of the Socialist Party from forming an alliance with the Communist Party in the election that is beneficial to the French working people. Therefore, the Faure caretaker cabinet issued an order stipulating that local party electoral alliances must be approved by the national leadership of the parties concerned, in an attempt to rely on the law to restrict the local organizations of the Socialist Party from forming electoral alliances with the Communist Party. They are trying to use this method to hinder the victory of progressive forces in the election.

After carrying out frantic activities, the various right-wing parties have formed various electoral groups. The main ones include the so-called "Republican Front" including the Mendès France faction, the Socialist Party, the Democratic Social Resistance Alliance, and the left-wing "Social Republican Party," as well as the alliance formed by the Faure faction of the original Radical Socialist Party, the People's Republican Party, the right-wing of the "Social Republican Party," the "Independent Republican Party," the "Independent Farmers' Party," and the "Republican and Social Action Party." However, due to factional splits within the various parties, in some provinces, the candidates of the above-mentioned parties refused to form electoral groups according to the agreement between their leaders. Therefore, about ten right-wing parties have formed about fifteen electoral groups.

Although the various right-wing parties have formed various electoral alliances, their platforms are basically the same, and they all advocate continuing to pursue the current policies that violate the national interests of France. Therefore, there is no difference in their positions.

In the face of the deepening division of right-wing parties, the unity of the French Communist Party with other democratic forces is constantly strengthening. The French Communist Party and other democratic forces have long believed that the policies of poverty, reaction, and war currently pursued by the French ruling clique should be terminated as soon as possible, and replaced with policies of peace and independence. This proposition is in line with the vital interests and aspirations of the French people. This situation has made some bourgeois news agency reporters worry that the electoral conspiracies of the right-wing parties cannot prevent the victory of the Communist Party and democratic forces.

### 关于法国大选

    关于法国大选
    五年一度的法国国民议会选举，已定于明年一月二日举行。
    大家知道，法国各资产阶级政党在选举制度的问题上，最近曾进行了激烈的斗争。由于它们之间的矛盾无法调和，国民议会推翻了富尔政府，而富尔却援引宪法的规定解散了议会，并决定提前举行选举。
    法国各资产阶级政党为什么会在选举的问题上发生这样激烈的斗争呢？这是由于这些政党因为奉行了反民族和反人民的政策而不敢面对法国人民。他们希望依靠一种不民主的选举制度来举行选举，以便能够在议会中排斥法国人民的真正代表——法国共产党，而保证它们窃取到较多的议席。这些政党虽然在力图排斥共产党这一点上是一样的，但是它们又各有打算，都想为自己的集团多捞几个议席，因而就不能不彼此发生了矛盾和冲突。
    在上届大选之前，法国统治集团为了废除比较民主的比例代表制（按照各党派所获选票数量的比例来分配议席），而代之以反民主的选举制度，曾经筹划了两年的光景，先后在议会中否决了二十多个选举制度，并且招致了一次政府危机，最后才勉强通过了一个便于各右翼党派结成联盟来反对共产党的一轮多数投票制。它们依靠这种制度夺取了法国共产党的八十个议席。但是法国共产党由于它和群众的密切联系，在非常不利的条件下仍然保持了一百多个议席，为议会中最大的政党之一。
    在今年十月富尔政府提出提前举行大选的要求以后，关于修改选举制度的斗争又再度发生。各种各样的选举制度在议会中提出来又被推翻，先后也有二十次之多。最后，修改选举制度的问题还是没有解决。富尔政府在一个新的选举制度还未制定出来的情况下就解散了议会，因此选举将仍然按照原来的选举制度——一轮多数投票制举行。这个选举制度的主要特点，是容许法国各党派结成集团参加选举。只要这个集团在一省获得的选票在总票数百分之五十以上，它就可以独占属于这个省的全部议席，然后由结成这个联盟的各党派自己去分配这些议席。参加这个集团的党派只要获得占总票数百分之五的选票就可以得到议席。而其他党派纵使获得了总票数百分之四十九的选票，却连一个议席都得不到。只有在没有任何一个党派或党派集团获得过半数选票的情况下，议席才按各党派得票多少的比例来分配。这种规定是为了便利法国的反动政党在选举中结成联盟，依靠联合的力量来对抗强大的进步力量，窃取议会的席位。一九五一年根据这个选举法举行的选举的结果，以法共为首的共和反法西斯联盟在选举中获得了五百万以上的选票，只得到一百零三个议席，但是获得选票比共产党少了约一百万张的法兰西人民联盟却得到了一百一十八席，甚至获得仅及共产党的选票的一半略多（二百七十万票）的社会党，所得议席也比共产党多一席。这种选举制度的反民主和不公平是显而易见的。
    法国共产党一贯反对这种反民主的竞选联盟制度。它曾经在议会里为废除这种不民主的选举制度而坚决斗争。最近它并号召一切进步力量团结起来，以便在这种制度没有废除的情况下予右翼集团以沉重打击。法国共产党的呼吁得到了社会党广大党员的热烈响应。这可以从下面这件事得到证明：社会党全国委员会在十二月六日曾就是否要同共产党联合竞选的问题进行表决的时候，赞成同共产党结盟的达一千二百四十三票之多，占投票总数的将近五分之二。此外，左翼激进社会党人、“新左翼联盟”、进步共和联盟以及青年共和党都响应了共产党的呼吁。
    目前法国的右翼政客正企图用种种方法阻止他们的党员群众和党的地方组织同共产党人一致行动。社会党右翼领袖强迫党的全国委员会通过了不许这个党的地方组织同共产党缔结选举联盟的决议。但是甚至社会党领导机关的命令也还阻止不了社会党地方组织和党员群众要同共产党在选举中结成有利于法国劳动人民的联盟。于是富尔看守内阁颁布了命令，规定各地的党派选举联盟必须得到有关党派的全国领导机构的批准，想依靠法律来限制社会党的地方组织同共产党结成选举联盟。它们企图用这种方法来阻挠进步力量在选举中取得胜利。
    各右翼党派在进行了狂热的活动后，分别结成了各种选举集团。其中主要的有包括孟戴斯—弗朗斯派、社会党、民主社会抵抗联盟、左翼“社会共和党”人的所谓“共和阵线”，以及由原来激进社会党的富尔派、人民共和党、“社会共和党”的右翼、“独立共和党”、“独立农民党”、“共和与社会行动党”所结成的联盟。但是，由于各政党内部的派系分裂，因而在若干省份，上述党派的候选人又拒绝按照他们领导人之间的协议结成选举集团。因此，十个左右的右翼党派倒组成了十五个左右的选举集团。
    各右翼政党虽然结成了各种各样的选举联盟，但是它们的政纲基本上是一样的，都主张继续奉行违反法国民族利益的现行政策。因此，它们的立场是没有差别的。
    在右翼党派分裂加深的情况下，法国共产党同其他民主力量的团结正在不断加强。法国共产党同其他民主力量早就认为应当尽早终止法国统治集团现在所奉行的导向贫困、反动和战争的政策，而代之以和平和独立的政策。这种主张是符合于法国人民的切身利益和愿望的。这种情形使得一些资产阶级通讯社的记者也耽忧，右翼党派的选举阴谋不能阻止共产党和民主力量的胜利。（闻）
