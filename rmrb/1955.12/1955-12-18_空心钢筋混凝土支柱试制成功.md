    Hollow Reinforced Concrete Support Successfully Trial-Produced
    The technicians and workers constructing the Xing'antai shaft in Hegang have successfully trial-produced a type of hollow reinforced concrete support, which is already being used in roadway construction.
    Using this hollow reinforced concrete support can replace the steel supports used in permanent roadway construction, which will save the country a large amount of steel. After trial use by the employees of the Xing'antai shaft, it has been proven that each steel support requires 120 kilograms of I-beam steel, costing 72 yuan; each hollow concrete support only requires 36 kilograms of I-beam steel, costing 35 yuan.
    Currently, the employees of the Xing'antai shaft are further summarizing their experiences with this type of support in order to promote its use.

    空心钢筋混凝土支柱试制成功
    建设鹤岗兴安台竖井的技术人员和工人们，试制成功了一种空心钢筋混凝土支柱，并且已经在巷道建设中使用。
    用这种空心钢筋混凝土支柱可以代替永久巷道建设中用的钢支柱，将可以为国家节省大量钢材。经过兴安台竖井职工们的试用证明：每根钢支柱需要工字钢一百二十公斤，成本七十二元；每根空心混凝土支柱只要工字钢三十六公斤，成本三十五元。
    现在，兴安台竖井的职工正进一步总结这种支柱的经验，以便推广。
