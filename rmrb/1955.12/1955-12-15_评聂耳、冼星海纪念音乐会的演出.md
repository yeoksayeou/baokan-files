Review of the Concert Commemorating Nie Er and Xian Xinghai
    Guo Naian

The concerts commemorating the 20th anniversary of Nie Er's death and the 10th anniversary of Xian Xinghai's death began in the capital in early December. It is extremely exciting that the brilliant works of these two great geniuses are appearing on the capital's stage in such a rich and perfect form for the first time. One or two decades have passed, but the works of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai have stood the test of time, and today they still demonstrate enormous and moving power. These works are still so fresh and inspiring to us. This is precisely because their works follow the principles of socialist realism, truly and profoundly reflecting reality, reflecting the revolutionary struggles of the time, and expressing the revolutionary enthusiasm and strength of our working class and the broad masses of the people.

The entire performance of the commemorative concert left us with a very deep impression. It is clear that every performer treated this performance with a very serious attitude. They all tried their best to understand the high revolutionary enthusiasm in the works of the two composers, and strived to truly express the spirit and thought of those works.

The Central Experimental Opera House Choir sang twelve famous revolutionary songs by Nie Er and Xian Xinghai at the concert, and almost every one of them received good results. Every member of the choir performed with seriousness and enthusiasm, concentrating all their energy on a true experience of the ideological feelings of the works. The choir's conductor, Jin Zhengping, is a talented young conductor. Although his conducting is not yet very experienced and mature, and his handling of individual songs (such as "Going to the Enemy's Rear") is not relaxed enough and his emotions are not solid enough, generally speaking, he can focus on grasping the content and musical image characteristics of each song in the treatment of the music, and use different techniques and diverse styles to handle the development of the song's emotions in a more detailed way, and powerfully highlight the climax. At the same time, under his direction, every program can be infused with unremitting enthusiasm, and the spirit of revolutionary optimism, the strong fighting will and the confidence in victory in the works of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai have been more prominently expressed by his treatment. In particular, in the performances of "Dockers' Song" and "Guerrilla Army," conductor Jin Zhengping's advantages were more clearly demonstrated. His handling of "Dockers' Song," from the very first sentence, paid attention to expressing the fortitude and heroism of the workers under heavy burdens. At the same time, he also effectively highlighted the climax of this song. In the section "Heavy sacks, steel bars, iron plates, wooden boxes, let them press on us!" the small choir made a loud sound, showing a strong power. Every section of the development of emotions, and the use of the strength of the sound, is deployed in a layered manner. In the performance of "Guerrilla Army," he grasped the image characteristics of the guerrilla's victorious advance and expressed it through the technique of crescendo and diminuendo. The optimism of the guerrillas was also given due emphasis. These all show that this young conductor is striving to carry out the artistic creation of conducting in accordance with the principles of socialist realism.

The singing of soprano Wu Shuyuan was praised by people, and this was not accidental. This actress, who we are not very familiar with, has a very valuable artistic creative personality in her singing. When she sang Nie Er's "Plum Girl's Song" and "Songstress Under the Iron Heel," her style was simple and sincere, and her emotions were sincere and touching. Her singing has no flamboyant emotions, and even less a sense of sentimentality. (And these two songs are the easiest to be sung sentimentally.) From this we can say that she correctly expressed the spirit of Nie Er's works. In addition, the singing of tenor Lou QianGui and soprano Zou Dehua in the solo programs were successful. They were welcomed not only because they had beautiful voices and skilled singing techniques, but also because they expressed a true experience of the ideological feelings of the works. What we feel is insufficient is the singing of baritone Li Weiboh. Of course, we can see that he is working hard to explore and wants to express Xian Xinghai's enthusiasm in the two songs "Hot Blood" and "Midnight Song." However, his understanding of the ideological foundation of the enthusiasm of these two songs is not deep enough, especially in "Midnight Song." On the one hand, he failed to fully reveal the strong side of the song's emotions. At the same time, the turning point of the emotions is not clear enough and lacks development. Therefore, his singing lacks appeal.

In the three songs sung by the Central People's Broadcasting Station's Children's Broadcasting Choir, we can also see their efforts to truthfully express life. They sang "Newspaper Boy Song" very well. These happy children who live in the Mao Zedong era, although they have not experienced the kind of life described by Nie Er in "Newspaper Boy Song," they have experienced the suffering of newspaper boys in the old era with great sympathy, and made this experience get a true expression in the singing. Undoubtedly, the conductor gave these teenagers a lot of inspiration in the usual teaching work.

In addition, we can also see the same efforts from the performance of the Central People's Broadcasting Station's National Orchestra. Especially when they played the folk music "Golden Snake Dance" adapted by Nie Er, the treatment of every detail of the music focused on how to make the people's happy emotions and the spirit of optimistic fighting that the work has be prominently expressed. It should also be pointed out that the "Chinese Rhapsody," which was adapted from an orchestral piece to be played by a national band, is a very beneficial attempt. This attempt is not only of practical significance for establishing and improving the structure of a national band, but also provides broad possibilities for the development of the national band.

The "National Liberation Symphony" conducted by Li Guoquan is one of the programs that is warmly welcomed by the masses. This is a large-scale work that Xian Xinghai began to write in 1935 and finally completed in 1941. This work was only performed for the first time at this commemorative concert, and only the third movement of the work was performed. But even this one movement can show the author's creative conception. The author uses the three dance forms of dragon boat dance, kite dance and lion dance to express the victorious growth of our navy, air force and army and other armed forces. Because it has profound content and vivid images, even though the work appears in the form of a symphony, it can still be quickly understood and accepted by the audience. For example, the lively festive scene expressed by the dragon boat dance, the bright spring scene expressed by the kite dance, and the powerful strength and jubilant emotions expressed by the lion dance can almost directly deeply infect every listener. The conductor quite perfectly expressed and interpreted the content of the work, although the main theme of the first section is not prominent enough and the image is not concentrated enough.

The commemorative concert ended with Xian Xinghai's magnificent work "Yellow River Cantata" performed by the Song and Dance Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Xian Xinghai's work praised the great spirit of our nation and the heroic spirit of the people. Under the direction of Shi Lemeng, a student of Xian Xinghai, the magnificent spirit of the "Yellow River Cantata" and its fighting temperament were fully expressed. From the beginning of the "Yellow River Boatman's Song," the conductor rendered the fighting atmosphere with a rough line. Until the final "Defend the Yellow River" and "Roar! Yellow River!" they were all permeated with full enthusiasm and majestic momentum. In this performance, in addition to the fact that the band part was mainly performed according to the final score revised by Xian Xinghai in the Soviet Union, many of the vocal parts were also performed according to this score. For example, "Yellow River Ballad" is like this. Here, the use of chorus better exerted the expressive power of different timbres in each part, and deepened the emotions of the music. The chorus that was finally added to "Yellow River Lament" also strengthened the atmosphere and emotional infection of the music. What is unsatisfactory is that the band part is not handled delicately enough, not coordinated enough, and cannot be closely combined with the vocal part. But in any case, this performance of the "Yellow River Cantata" is much more perfect than before. This is not only because we already have good performance conditions, but also because the comrades of the Song and Dance Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army showed a high degree of enthusiasm in this performance.

Judging from the warm welcome of this commemorative concert, we have reason to require national music groups to widely and frequently perform the works of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, and widely and frequently perform the works of other socialist realist composers of their time. Their works are an integral part of the excellent tradition of our national music and must be inherited and promoted. When these works become regular programs performed by our music groups, they will enable our younger generation to better understand how arduous and heroic the road our revolutionary struggle has taken, and better understand how precious our victory today is; and draw strength from these works to inspire our enthusiasm and confidence in building socialism. I want to repeat once again that this concert was indeed a satisfactory concert, and I hope to hear more performances of such concerts in the future. (Attached picture)

    评聂耳、冼星海纪念音乐会的演出
    郭乃安
    聂耳逝世二十周年、冼星海逝世十周年纪念音乐会，十二月初开始在首都举行。两位伟大天才的辉煌作品，第一次以这样丰富和完美的形式出现在首都的舞台上，这是十分令人兴奋的事情。一、二十年过去了，但是聂耳和冼星海的作品经受了时间的考验，在今天，仍然显示出巨大的感人的力量。这些作品对于我们来说，还是那么新鲜，那么令人鼓舞。这正是因为他们的作品是遵循着社会主义现实主义的原则，真实而深刻地反映了现实，反映了当时的革命斗争，表现了我国工人阶级和广大人民群众的革命热情和力量的缘故。
    纪念音乐会的全部演出，给我们留下了极为深刻的印象。可以明显地看出：每一个表演者都是以十分严肃的态度来对待这次演出的。他们都尽力去体会两位作曲家作品中的高度的革命热情，力求真实地把那些作品的精神和思想表现出来。
    中央实验歌剧院合唱队在音乐会上共演唱了十二首聂耳和冼星海的著名的革命歌曲，几乎每一首都收到良好的效果。合唱队的每一个队员都在演唱中表现得十分严肃和热情，他们把全部精神都集中在对作品的思想感情的真实体验上。合唱的指挥金正平是一个有才能的青年指挥者，他的指挥虽然还不是怎样老练和成熟，对个别歌曲（如“到敌人后方去”）的处理显得不够从容，情绪还不够坚实；但总的说来，他在乐曲的处理上能够着重去抓住每一首歌曲的内容和音乐形象的特点，用不同的手法，以多样的风格，比较细致地处理歌曲情绪的发展，并有力地把高潮突现出来。同时，在他的指挥下，每一个节目都能够贯注着不懈的热情，聂耳和冼星海作品中的革命乐观主义的精神、坚强的战斗意志和胜利的信心，都由他的处理得到了比较突出的表现。特别是在“码头工人歌”和“游击军”这两首歌的演出中，指挥金正平的这些优点表现得更为鲜明。他对“码头工人歌”的处理，从第一句起，就注意到要把劳动者在沉重的负担下的那种刚毅和英勇的气质表现出来。同时他也很有效地突现了这首歌曲的高潮，在“笨重的麻袋，钢条，铁板，木头箱，都往我们身上压吧！”这一段中，人数不多的合唱队发出响亮的声音，表现出刚强的力量。情绪发展的每一个段落，音的力度的运用，都是有层次地部署的。在“游击军”的演唱中，他抓住了游击队胜利进军的形象特征，通过渐强又至渐弱的手法把它表现出来。游击队的乐观主义精神也得到了应有的强调。这些都说明这位青年指挥者是在努力按照社会主义现实主义的原则来进行指挥的艺术创造的。
    女高音吴书媛的演唱，受到人们的赞赏，这不是偶然的。这位我们并不十分熟知的演员，在她的演唱中有着十分可贵的艺术创作的个性。她唱聂耳的“梅娘曲”和“铁蹄下的歌女”的时候，作风是朴素的和淳厚的，情绪是真挚的和感人的。她的演唱没有浮夸的感情，更没有一点感伤的意味。（而这两首歌是最容易被人唱得感伤的。）由此我们可以说，她正确地表现了聂耳作品的精神。此外，在独唱节目中，男高音楼乾贵和女高音邹德华的演唱都是成功的，他们的受到欢迎，不仅由于他们有优美的歌喉和熟练的演唱技巧，同时也由于他们表现了对于作品的思想感情的真实体验。使我们感到不足的是男中音李维渤的演唱，当然我们看得出他是在努力探求，想把冼星海在“热血”和“夜半歌声”这两首歌中的热情表现出来。但是他对于这两首歌曲的热情的思想基础理解得还不够深，特别是在“夜半歌声”中，一方面，他没有能够充分揭示出歌曲情绪的刚强的一面，同时，情绪的转折不够鲜明，也缺乏发展。因此，他的歌声就缺乏感染力。
    在中央人民广播电台少年广播合唱团演唱的三首歌曲中，我们也可以看出他们对真实地表现生活所作的努力。他们的“卖报歌”唱得很好。这些生活在毛泽东时代的幸福少年们，虽然并没有经历过像聂耳在“卖报歌”中所描写的那种生活，但是他们却以极大的同情心去体验旧时代报童的痛苦，并且使这种体验在演唱中得到真实的表现。无疑地，指挥者在平时的教唱工作中曾经给这些少年们以不少的启发。
    此外，我们还可以从中央人民广播电台民族管弦乐团的演出中看到同样的努力。特别是在他们演奏聂耳改编的民间乐曲“金蛇狂舞”的时候，对乐曲的每一个细节的处理，都集中在如何使作品所具有的人民的欢乐情绪和乐观主义的战斗精神得以突出地表现出来。还应该指出，从管弦乐曲改编为民族乐队演奏的“中国狂想曲”，是一个非常有益的尝试。这一尝试不仅对于建立完善的民族乐队的编制有着实际意义，同时对于民族乐队的发展也提供了广泛的可能性。
    由黎国荃指挥的“民族解放交响乐”，是受群众热烈欢迎的节目之一。这是冼星海从一九三五年开始写作，至一九四一年最后完成的一首大型作品。这个作品直到这个纪念音乐会才第一次得到演出，而且只演出作品的第三乐章。但即使是这一个乐章，也可以看出作者创造性的构思。作者以龙船舞、纸鹞舞和狮子舞等三段舞曲体裁，表现我国海军、空军、陆军等武装力量的胜利成长。由于它具有深刻的内容和鲜明的形象，所以尽管作品是以交响乐的形式出现，也仍然能为观众迅速理解和接受。像龙船舞所表现的生气勃勃的节日情景，纸鹞舞所表现的那种明媚的春日的景象，以及狮子舞所表现的那种雄厚的力量和欢腾的情绪，差不多是每一个听者都能够直接地受到深切的感染的。指挥者相当完善地表现和解释了作品的内容，虽然第一段的主调还不够突出，形象也还不够集中。
    纪念音乐会是以中国人民解放军总政治部文艺工作团歌舞团演出的冼星海的宏伟作品“黄河大合唱”作结束的。冼星海的这部作品歌颂了我们民族的伟大精神和人民的英雄气慨。在冼星海的学生时乐濛的指挥下，“黄河大合唱”的宏伟气魄，它的战斗的气质，都得到了充分的表现。从开始的“黄河船夫曲”起，指挥者便以一种粗犷的线条把那战斗的气氛渲染出来。直到最后的“保卫黄河”和“怒吼吧！黄河”都贯穿着饱满的热情和雄强的气势。这次演出，除了乐队部分主要是依据冼星海最后在苏联时期修改的总谱来演出的以外，声乐部分也有很多是按照这个谱子演出的。如：“黄水谣”就是如此。这里由于采用了合唱，更好地发挥了各声部不同音色的表现力，加深了乐曲的情绪。“黄河怨”中最后加入的合唱，也加强了乐曲的气氛和情绪的感染。令人感到不足的地方，就是乐队的部分处理得还不够细腻，不够协调，还不能和声乐部分紧密地结合起来。但无论如何，这次的“黄河大合唱”的演出，比起以往的已经完善得多了。这不仅因为我们已经有了良好的演出条件，而且因为中国人民解放军总政治部文艺工作团歌舞团的同志们在这次演出中表现了高度的热情。
    从这次纪念音乐会的受到热烈欢迎的情况来看，我们有理由要求全国的音乐团体广泛地和经常地演出聂耳和冼星海的作品，广泛地和经常地演出和他们同时代的其他社会主义现实主义作曲家的作品。他们的作品是我们民族音乐优秀传统的一个组成部分，必须加以继承和发扬。当这些作品成为我们各音乐团体经常上演的节目的时候，便能让我们青年一代更懂得我们的革命斗争曾经走过多么艰苦而又多么英勇的道路，更懂得我们今天的胜利是多么值得珍贵；并且从这些作品中吸取力量，鼓舞我们建设社会主义的热情和信心。我要再重复一句，这次音乐会确是一次令人满意的音乐会，希望今后能多听到这样的音乐会的演出。（附图片）
