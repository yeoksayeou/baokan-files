Handling Members' Means of Production Must Be Done Through Full Consultation

In agricultural production cooperatives with partial collective ownership of the means of production, properly handling the privately owned land and other major means of production of members in accordance with the policy of mutual benefit is a crucial issue in fundamentally changing the relations of production in agriculture. In China's specific circumstances, the public ownership of agricultural means of production must take the form of a gradual transition. Therefore, we must handle this issue with the utmost care and in the most appropriate manner in the agricultural cooperativization movement, strictly implement the policy of mutual benefit, and reach a point where everyone in the cooperative is satisfied through full consultation.

The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that agricultural production cooperatives in China, at the present stage, are generally elementary cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature characterized by land shares and unified management. Therefore, whether in establishing or consolidating cooperatives, it is necessary to reasonably handle the private property of members based on the principle of mutual benefit, to facilitate the development and consolidation of the cooperative. Because there are differences in the quantity and quality of the means of production possessed by the members, appropriate agreements must be reached among the members, mainly between poor and middle peasants, on these issues as well as sideline occupations. The "Draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" also stipulates that the consent of the members must be obtained when handling the means of production of the members; and it stipulates that "all staff of the cooperative should closely integrate with the members and fully consult on all matters." This should be the case when handling any important matters within the cooperative, and even more so when handling fundamental issues such as the means of production.

Handling members' means of production is a very complex matter. At present, the masses have a high degree of enthusiasm for joining cooperatives, and the Party's resolutions and the draft model charter have made clear provisions for the policies and methods for handling the means of production, allowing people to act in accordance with the regulations. This is an extremely favorable condition for doing this work well. However, it must not be assumed that with these conditions, handling members' means of production becomes a simple matter. One of the important reasons why the masses are enthusiastic about joining cooperatives is that they have seen that the Party's policies and the specific methods of handling members' means of production in the established cooperatives are fair and reasonable. The Party's policies stipulate the main methods for solving common problems in various places, but it is impossible to stipulate detailed methods for solving all kinds of different specific problems. In order to correctly implement the Party's policies and solve various practical problems, it is necessary to educate the masses well, rely on the masses, and, under leadership, mobilize the cooperative members to conduct full consultation.

According to investigations in various places, the majority of newly established agricultural production cooperatives have handled the main means of production of members well or relatively well, and only a small number have handled this issue poorly or very poorly. Those who have handled it well have generally gone through relatively full democratic consultation. Many new cooperatives in Shandong, Hebei, Guangdong, and other provinces, when handling the means of production, under the leadership of the branch, with the preparatory committee as the main body, absorbed some impartial members to form an evaluation group, or democratically elected an evaluation committee, first conducted evaluation experiments to obtain evaluation standards and preliminary experience, then evaluated each plot of land, each livestock, and each farm implement household by household, formulated a plan, and then the evaluators went to each household to consult and adjust, or discussed and consulted in groups to adjust, and then convened a meeting of cooperative members to announce the evaluation results, discuss amendments, and finally pass it. This achieved fairness and reasonableness, everyone was satisfied, and the enthusiasm for collective production was very high. The cooperative members said: Joining the cooperative has three advantages—everything is well-discussed, no one suffers a loss, and production increases.

The reason why the means of production are not handled well is generally because there has not been full consultation. The programs for evaluating land, livestock, and large farm tools in seven new cooperatives in Longping Township, Tianyang County, Guangxi Province, were uniformly formulated by township staff and the core members of the cooperative establishment, who each took them back to their cooperatives and announced them at a meeting of cooperative members one evening, considering that they had been "passed." Because some staff members did not trust the masses and were afraid of quarrels occurring during the discussion of the plans, which would be "difficult to manage," they deliberately used vague language when reading out the plans, wanting to get through it perfunctorily. Some staff members also believed that as long as they spent more brainpower, the plan would be fair and reasonable, and letting the cooperative members discuss and revise it would only make it more confusing. The plan for evaluating land, livestock, and large farm tools in a new cooperative in Shaping Township, Yongning, was devised by a few core members of the cooperative establishment who spent three days locked in a room calculating; the masses came to inquire about the formulation of the plan with great concern, but they were very impatient. As a result, many cooperative members were dissatisfied and had increasing concerns. Some cooperative members who had happily signed up to join the cooperative asked to withdraw because the evaluation of the means of production was unreasonable; some cooperative members were afraid of being seen as backward and being excluded from the cooperative, so they did not express their opinions, but their enthusiasm for production was very low. How can such cooperatives be consolidated!

Democratic consultation must be truly and fully conducted to have good results. The preparatory committee of the Yang Chongsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuming County, Guangxi Province, first formulated a draft plan for evaluating land shares and submitted it to the meeting of cooperative member representatives for discussion; based on the opinions put forward by everyone, the preparatory committee consulted in detail with experienced elderly farmers, formulated a second plan, and then asked the cooperative member representatives to discuss it again; then, based on the opinions of the cooperative member representatives, they studied and revised it, and made a third plan; it was not finalized until everyone was satisfied.

What if some cooperative members still disagree even after full consultation and a fair and reasonable plan? If this happens, the first thing to do is to check whether these cooperative members have been well informed about the policies. The process of handling the means of production should be seen as a process of raising the ideological awareness of the cooperative members. According to investigations in Baishui and Langshi Townships in Qujiang, Guangdong, among the 156 new cooperative members in four cooperatives, 64 did not understand the specific policies of the cooperative for handling the means of production; some cooperative members knew what the policies stipulated, but did not understand why they were stipulated in this way. Naturally, it is difficult to get them to agree. The policies should be explained to them in the context of reality, rather than reading out the articles of the policies in a dry manner; they should understand that the provisions of the policies are in line with the interests of all cooperative members, and also in line with their own interests. If they already understand the policies but still disagree, then it is necessary to find out what things they have not yet figured out. Many farmers, starting from their own interests, often instinctively and directly believe that their own incorrect opinions are correct; the most effective way to make them realize that their opinions are incorrect is to calculate detailed accounts and conduct on-the-spot inspections and comparisons. A newly built cooperative in Jijie Township, Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, did a relatively good job. Chen Hongguang, a middle peasant member of this cooperative, had a plot of land with an average actual yield of more than 900 catties per mu; everyone evaluated it as 770 catties, and he disagreed. An account was calculated for him: one plot of land had a high yield because a lot of chemical fertilizer and other fertilizers were applied; another plot of land was sandy soil, and the terrain was very high, requiring eleven more workdays per mu per year for irrigation than ordinary fields; and another plot of land required an additional 200 catties of rice per mu per year in fertilizer and labor, but the soil quality was not greatly improved. After deducting 200 catties of rice, the actual yield was 718 catties per mu. The evaluation of 770 catties was already an appropriate consideration for his processing, fertilization, and technological improvements. After this calculation, he was satisfied. As for those cooperative members who still disagree and ask to withdraw from the cooperative even after all the work has been done and the plan is indeed fair and reasonable, they should, of course, be allowed to withdraw.

Will full consultation take more time and delay production? There are three main reasons why the evaluation of the means of production takes time: first, the staff is not familiar with this work and has not mastered the policies and methods well; second, they have not grasped the situation and prepared well in advance; and another reason is precisely that there has not been sufficient democratic consultation. According to experience in various places, the best way to enable the core members and activists of the new cooperatives to grasp the policies and correct methods relatively quickly is to rely on the old cooperatives. The Daqushan District Committee of Haiyang, Shandong, mobilized 34 core members of the old cooperatives to help the new cooperatives with the evaluation of the means of production, and they helped 45 new cooperatives complete this work in five or six days. It should be noted here that the specific methods of the old cooperatives should not be applied rigidly, and those that are not suitable for the specific conditions of the new cooperatives and those that were originally handled improperly by the old cooperatives should be changed. If there are no old cooperatives nearby, efforts can be concentrated on evaluating a new cooperative with relatively good conditions first, and then other cooperatives can learn from it. Using the cooperative network to study and promote the evaluation of the means of production is also a good method. Some villages and towns in Nangong, Qiu County, and Wu'an, Hebei, have adopted these methods and have achieved good results. Preparatory work is also very important. Before evaluating land yields, the staff of the Luoxi Agricultural Production Cooperative, a newly built cooperative in Bucun Township, Suichuan, Jiangxi, paid attention to grasping the situation of land yields of various types and the ideological situation of various cooperative members regarding land yield evaluation, and the work proceeded relatively smoothly. When evaluating the means of production, the new cooperative in Xiliman Village, Raoyang, Hebei, did not mobilize the masses to conduct detailed evaluations, and as a result, 15 cooperative members did not allow the cooperative to use their livestock, and production could not proceed smoothly; later, full democratic consultation was conducted, the unreasonable parts were corrected, and the 85 livestock of the entire cooperative were quickly evaluated, and collective production began.

Whether full consultation and fairness and reasonableness have been achieved in handling the means of production of cooperative members is also the most effective exercise and test for the core members of the newly built cooperatives. Some core members are afraid of many opinions from the masses, afraid of trouble, and afraid of leading the work of evaluating the means of production, or adopt simple and crude methods. Some core members only care about their own interests, and those with more land often take the lead in overreporting yields. Some poor peasant core members say: Now that we have the advantage, we can handle the means of production as we please. In this way, it is naturally difficult to do this work well, and the core members will also become divorced from the masses as a result. Among the 13 preparatory committee members of the new cooperative in Xixi Township, Qujiang, Guangdong, four were not elected as cooperative affairs committee members because they were unfair and selfish when evaluating the means of production. On the contrary, some cooperative members of some new cooperatives, although not preparatory committee members, were elected as leaders of the cooperative because they showed fairness and ability when evaluating the means of production.

Therefore, county and district Party committees, village branches, and cooperative staff must pay close attention to continuing to educate core members in the process of establishing cooperatives, and cultivate them into mass leaders who are closely linked to the masses, selfless, not afraid of trouble, and not afraid of difficulties, so that they can "honestly evaluate themselves and fairly evaluate others" in the process of evaluating the means of production, and further gain the trust of the masses in the process of establishing cooperatives. Only in this way, after the cooperative is built, will they be able to effectively lead the cooperative members to advance on the road of collective production and common prosperity.

### 处理社员的生产资料必须经过充分协商

    处理社员的生产资料必须经过充分协商
    在生产资料部分集体所有制的农业生产合作社里，按照互利政策处理社员私有的土地和别的主要生产资料，是从根本上改变农业中的生产关系的关键问题。在我国的具体情况下，农业生产资料的公有化，必须采取逐步过渡的形式。因此，我们在农业合作化运动中要用最大的注意力和最妥善的方式来处理这个问题，要严格地执行互利政策，经过充分的协商，达到社内人人满意。
    中共七届六中全会决议指出，我国的农业生产合作社在现阶段一般地是以土地入股、统一经营为特点的半社会主义性质的初级合作社。因此，不论在建社或整社的时候，都必须根据互利的原则，合理地处理社员的私有财产，以利于合作社的发展和巩固。因为社员之间占有的生产资料有数量多少和质量好坏的差别，所以必须在社员之间，主要的是在贫农和中农之间，就这些问题以及副业等问题，取得适当的协议。“农业生产合作社示范章程草案”中也规定，在处理社员的生产资料的时候，必须得到社员的同意；并且规定“合作社的一切工作人员应该同社员密切结合，遇事充分协商”。处理社内任何重要事情都应该这样，在处理生产资料这样的根本问题上更应该这样。
    处理社员的生产资料是一件非常复杂的事情。现在，群众的入社积极性很高，党的决议和示范章程草案又对处理生产资料的政策和办法作了明确的规定，人们可以照章办事，这是做好这个工作的极其有利的条件。可是，决不可以认为有了这些条件，处理社员的生产资料就成了一件简单的事情。群众入社的积极性高，重要原因之一正是看到了党的政策和已建成的合作社处理社员的生产资料的具体办法公平合理。党的政策规定了解决各地共同的问题的主要办法，但是决不可能规定出解决各种不同的具体问题的详细办法。为了正确地执行党的政策，解决各种实际问题，就必须很好地教育群众，依靠群众，有领导地发动社员群众，进行充分的协商。
    根据各地调查，新建立的农业生产合作社，对于社员的主要生产资料处理得很好或者比较好的占大多数，对于这个问题处理得不大好或者很不好的只占少数。处理得好的，一般都经过比较充分的民主协商。山东、河北、广东和别的省份的许多新社，在处理生产资料的时候，在支部领导下，以筹备委员会为主，吸收一部分办事公道的社员组成评议小组，或者民主选举成立评议委员会，先进行评产试验，得出评产的标准和初步经验以后，逐户评议每块地、每头牲口、每件农具，制定方案以后又由评议员分头到各户协商调整，或者分组讨论协商调整，然后召开社员大会，公布评定结果，讨论修正，最后通过。这样做到了公平合理，大家满意，集体生产的积极性很高。社员们说：入社有三好——凡事商量好，互不吃亏好，增加生产好。
    对生产资料处理得不好的，一般地都是因为没有经过充分的协商。广西省田阳县隆平乡七个新社评议土地、牲畜、大农具的方案，是乡的工作人员和建社骨干分子统一制定的，各自带回本社，用一个晚上的时间召开社员大会公布，就算“通过”了。因为有些工作人员不相信群众，害怕在讨论方案的时候发生争吵，“难以收拾”，所以他们在宣读方案的时候故意含糊其词，想马马虎虎过去就算了。还有一些工作人员认为只要自己多费些脑筋，方案就会公平合理，让社员群众讨论修订，反而容易弄乱。邕宁沙平乡一个新社评议土地、牲畜、大农具的方案，就是少数建社骨干分子用了三天时间关在房子里打算盘制定出来的；群众十分关切地来打听制定方案的情形，他们却很不耐烦。结果引起许多社员不满，顾虑越来越多。有些社员满心高兴报名入社，因为生产资料评得不合理又要求退社；有些社员怕说自己落后，怕被排斥出社，有意见也不提，但是生产积极性非常低。这样的合作社怎么能巩固呢！
    民主协商必须真正充分地进行，才会有好的效果。广西省武鸣县杨崇生农业生产合作社的筹委会先制定土地评产入社方案（草案），交给社员代表会讨论；筹委会根据大家提出的意见，同熟悉情况的年老农民详细商量，制定第二次方案，再请社员代表讨论；然后根据社员代表的意见，加以研究修改，做出第三次方案；直到大家都满意了，才算最后定案。
    充分协商了，方案公平合理了，有些社员还是不同意，怎么办？如果发生了这种情形，首先要检查一下对这些社员是不是很好地宣传了政策。应该把处理生产资料的过程看作提高社员的思想觉悟的过程。据广东曲江白水、浪石两个乡调查，四个社的一百五十六户新社员当中，不懂合作社处理生产资料的具体政策的就有六十四户；还有一些社员虽然知道政策是怎么规定的，却不明白为什么要这样规定。这样，自然很难让他们同意。应该联系实际向他们讲解政策，而不是干巴巴地念政策的条文；要使他们了解政策的规定合乎全体社员的利益，也合乎他们自己的利益。如果他们已经了解政策，还是不同意，那就还要弄清楚他们有些什么事情还没想通。许多农民，从自己的利益出发，往往本能地直觉地认为自己的不正确的意见是正确的；要使他认识自己的意见不正确，最有效的办法是算细账和实地察看比较。广东省潮安县吉街乡的一个新建社做的比较好。这个社的中农社员陈宏光有一块地，平均每亩实产量是九百多斤；大家给他评定的是七百七十斤，他不同意。给他算了一笔账：有一块田产量高，是因为施了许多化学肥料和别的肥料；另一块地是沙质土壤，地势又很高，比一般田每年要多用十一个工车水；还有一块地每年每亩多施的肥料和多用的工折合稻谷二百多斤，可是土质并没有很大的改良。把二百多斤稻谷除去，每亩实收七百一十八斤。评成七百七十斤，已经是对他加工加肥、改进技术作了适当的照顾。这一算，他就满意了。至于一切工作都做到了，方案也确实公平合理，有的社员仍然不同意，要求退社，那当然要允许他退社。
    充分协商，要多费时间，会耽误生产，怎么办？评议生产资料拖延时间，主要原因有三：一是工作人员对这个工作不熟悉，没有很好地掌握住政策和方法；一是没有及早掌握情况，做好准备工作；还有一个原因正是没有充分地进行民主协商。根据各地经验，要使新社的骨干分子和积极分子比较快地掌握政策和正确的方法，最好的办法是依靠老社。山东海阳大山区委动员了老社的骨干分子三十四人帮助新社做评议生产资料的工作，五、六天的时间就帮助四十五个新社把这个工作做好了。这里应当注意的是不要硬套老社的具体办法，不适合新社具体情况的和老社本来就处理得不妥当的，应当改变。附近没有老社的，可以集中力量在一个条件比较好的新社先评，做出样子以后，别的社就可以学习。运用合作网研究和推动评议生产资料的工作，也是一个好办法。河北南宫、邱县、武安的一些乡村，采用这些办法，已得到了很好的效果。事前的准备工作也很重要。江西遂川卜村乡新建的罗溪农业生产合作社在评土地产量以前，工作人员就注意掌握了各类土地产量情况和各类社员对于土地评产的思想情况，工作就进行得比较顺利。河北饶阳西里满村的新社，评议生产资料的时候没有很好地发动群众细评，结果，有十五户社员不让社里使他们的牲口，生产不能顺利进行；后来进行了充分的民主协商，纠正了不合理的部分，全社的八十五头牲口很快就评完了，开始了集体生产。
    在处理社员的生产资料的时候是不是做到了充分协商、公平合理，这对于新建社的骨干分子也是最有效的锻炼和考验。有些骨干分子怕群众意见多，怕麻烦，怕领导评议生产资料的工作，或者采取简单生硬的方式。有些骨干分子只顾自己的利益，自己土地多的往往带头浮报产量。一部分贫农骨干分子则说：现在咱们占了优势，处理生产资料可得由着咱了。这样，自然很难把这个工作做好，骨干分子也会因此脱离群众。广东曲江?溪乡的那个新社的十三个筹备委员中，就有四个人因为在评议生产资料的时候不公道、自私自利而没有被选为社务委员。相反，有些新社的社员，虽然不是筹备委员，因为在评议生产资料的时候表现出来公道能干，就被选举为社里的领导人员。
    因此，县区党委、乡村支部和办社工作人员必须在建社过程中十分注意继续教育骨干分子，培养他们成为密切联系群众、大公无私、不怕麻烦、不怕困难的群众领导者，使他们在评议生产资料的过程中“老老实实地评自己，公公道道地评别人”，使他们在建社过程中进一步得到群众的信任。只有这样，在建成合作社以后，他们才能够有力地领导社员群众在集体生产、共同富裕的道路上前进。
