    Further Improve the Work of Transforming Capitalist Industry and Commerce
    Private Grain Stores Become State-Owned Grain Store Outlets
    He Zhuo
    Between April and May of this year, thirty private grain retailers in Tianjin completed their socialist transformation, becoming outlets of state-owned grain stores. Capitalists, owners, and employees alike became state workers.
    In the early days of Tianjin's liberation, private grain merchants could freely purchase goods from the market, and the state-owned grain company had not yet occupied the retail positions. Consequently, some private grain retailers colluded with wholesalers to hoard and refuse to sell, seeking exorbitant profits, disrupting the market, and taking the lead in raising prices; they also used methods of "adulteration, substituting inferior goods, and shortchanging" to deceive and exploit consumers.
    Beginning in the second half of 1952, the strength of the socialist economy grew, and the state possessed abundant grain reserves with long-term stable prices. It became impossible for some private grain merchants to stir up trouble and disrupt prices in the market. At the same time, state-owned grain retail companies and cooperatives established many new grain selling points. The masses naturally trusted state-owned grain stores, which would not engage in deception. As a result, the business of private grain stores became increasingly desolate.
    This is how private grain merchants in Tianjin learned their first lesson in socialist transformation: In the new China under the leadership of the working class, if private industrialists and merchants want to continue to maintain their capitalist mode of operation of harming others for their own benefit and engaging in speculation, and resist the socialist economic forces, their path will become narrower and narrower, to the point where it is difficult to sustain their own existence.
    In November 1953, the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and all private grain retailers in Tianjin were transformed into state grain consignment stores, with the entire industry brought into the orbit of state capitalism.
    Becoming a state grain consignment store solved a problem for capitalists that they had never been able to solve in history—a fixed income and guaranteed employment. Liu Kuiwu, the manager of Yongxiang Sheng Grain Store, said:
  “The grain store I ran was squeezed out of business just before liberation. After liberation, I raised money to open this store again. Now that it has become a state consignment store, business is completely guaranteed. Our store sells over 100,000 jin of grain each month. The handling fees given by the state are sufficient to cover expenses. When it was private, we had limited funds, and if we bought millet, we lacked white flour, and if we bought white flour, we lacked corn. We worried when buying grain, and we worried when we couldn't sell it after buying it. It's much less worry now.” Liu Kuiwu's words reflect the true feelings of small and medium capitalists. Some small capitalists and owners relied entirely on borrowing money to do business. After becoming consignment stores, they could sell tens of thousands of jin of grain to the state each month and still receive a certain amount of handling fees. These people were even more grateful from the bottom of their hearts, saying that they were entirely saved by the state.
    When socialism increases and capitalism decreases in grain stores, it will naturally play a beneficial role in the national economy and the people's livelihood, suppressing unfavorable factors. After the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the food supply for the more than two million people in Tianjin was organized in an orderly manner, and private grain consignment stores played a significant role. After the implementation of consignment sales, the business management of grain stores also improved. In the past, the corn flour, the main grain of Tianjin citizens sold by private grain stores, always had sand and was gritty. After consignment sales, the state used carefully selected corn for unified processing and improved the method of grinding flour, making the corn flour more palatable. In the past, private grain stores did not have a complete variety of grains, and what kind of grain to sell was determined by the size of the profit, especially with various beans (so-called unpopular goods) priced especially high. Now, not only is the variety complete, but also the prices are clearly marked. Last year, Tianjin suffered a major flood. Citizens reflected: This flood was much larger than the one in 1939. If the state had not managed these private grain stores and implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, who knows how many people would have starved to death!
    Compared with private grain stores, grain consignment stores have many more advantages, whether for the country or the people, for the public or the private. However, this is only a preliminary transformation. Some capitalists always try to harm others for their own benefit and will always find loopholes to exploit, and there are always contradictions with the socialist planned economy. For example, the state's requirement is to save grain as much as possible on the basis of reasonable supply. However, in order to earn more handling fees, consignment stores want to sell as much grain as possible. Many grain stores often sell grain beyond the prescribed supply range, and some capitalists even incite residents to over-report their grain needs. The state's requirement is to supply grain according to the actual needs of each household in a planned way, but some consignment stores embezzle for personal gain, supplying more than the quota to their relatives and friends, and shortchanging ordinary residents when selling grain, keeping the extra for themselves. Many consignment stores also falsely report grain losses and grain store expenses to the state. Moreover, due to the speculative nature of private grain merchants, the state cannot entrust them with the task of issuing grain coupons, making state-owned grain stores particularly busy and causing inconvenience to residents. At the same time, the old grain stores are very scattered and unevenly distributed. Many grain stores have simple equipment and small storefronts, making it inconvenient for residents to buy grain and for the state to manage the consignment stores. The labor conditions of employees are also not good, and there is waste in the use of labor, grain storage, and transportation. Although the Tianjin Municipal Grain Bureau has carried out necessary mergers and adjustments of these consignment stores, because some of these consignment stores have labor-capital relations, some are small owners, some stores are large, some are small, the wage levels and management costs are inconsistent, and because they are all private, there are many difficulties in merging and adjusting. After the merger, they often quarrel due to issues such as profit distribution.
    All these situations show that the interests of the state and the people, as well as the development of the objective situation, require further transformation of the capitalist ownership and private ownership of private grain consignment stores.
    Change is needed. And change is possible.
    After more than a year of implementing the consignment form of state capitalism, the conditions for further transformation into public ownership have fully matured: First, the free market no longer exists. The commodity operated by consignment stores—grain—is a material purchased and sold by the state in a unified manner and is entirely owned by the state. It is no longer possible for capitalists to purchase goods privately and expand their business. Second, consignment stores must purchase and sell according to the planned amount based on the designated supply range and the fixed needs of consumers. It is also impossible for capitalists to arbitrarily expand the amount of money sold. Third, consignment stores receive a certain percentage of handling fees from the state based on the amount of grain sold, the profit is fixed, and it is no longer possible to pursue high profits. Moreover, the money earned from selling grain is handed over to the bank on the same day, making it impossible to use it for speculation and profiteering. Fourth, the original working capital has been handed over to the bank as a consignment guarantee, and the capitalists' capital can no longer play the role of capital. Fifth, the grain store is led by an operating management committee with representatives from the state grain department and employee representatives. Operating management expenses must be reviewed and approved and spent according to plan. The work of the grain store is subject to daily supervision by employees and the broad masses of consumers. If capitalists engage in embezzlement and have poor service attitudes, they will be exposed and criticized at any time. At the same time, the capital of these grain stores is relatively small, generally only a few hundred yuan, and very few are over a thousand yuan; and the number of employees is not large, and capitalists generally participate in auxiliary labor. Under these circumstances, capitalists feel that the source of goods, the amount of money sold, the profits, and the operating management expenses are all included in the state's planned track, and the work in the store and the original capital are also directly or indirectly managed by the state. After being transformed into a state-owned grain store, it is not only glorious, but also can avoid many responsibilities such as paying taxes to the tax bureau and submitting reports to the grain department. From their own personal experience, they feel that once they embark on the road of state capitalism, one foot is brought into the threshold of socialism, and the other foot has to follow. The general trend is that the ending of completely completing socialist transformation is inevitable. And transforming into complete socialist ownership, for the individual, will bring a relaxed and happy life that they have never enjoyed before. Therefore, they generally want to be transformed into outlets of state-owned grain stores, and many people have taken the initiative to apply. Small owners and employees feel that after becoming state workers, their personal development prospects will no longer be restricted, so they are even more willing to be transformed into state-owned.
    After analyzing these conditions, the Tianjin Municipal Grain Bureau first selected thirty consignment stores with better operating styles and service attitudes in May of this year and merged them into twenty-nine state-owned grain store outlets.
    After the transformation into state-owned, all the employees of the consignment stores were properly安置. Some talented employees and progressive and experienced capitalists were promoted to be leaders of the outlets. Liu Kuiwu, the manager of Yongxiang Sheng Grain Store, was assigned as the manager of the manager area this time, leading five outlets. Several elderly employees and capitalists over the age of sixty were persuaded to retire and enjoy their old age, and their children were replaced by employment. In the arrangement, appropriate adjustments were made to the staffing. After these people were transferred to state-owned outlets, the average wage level of capitalists, small owners, and employees was about the same as before, and welfare benefits such as public medical care and half-price treatment for family members were increased compared to the past.
    After these thirty consignment stores were transformed into state-owned grain store outlets, capitalists, owners, and employees were generally satisfied. Capitalists felt that the burden was very heavy in the past, and they had to be responsible for everything, often worrying and having no fixed working hours. Now that the business is simpler, they also have the opportunity to go to spare-time schools to improve their culture, and they feel much less worried than before. Especially after becoming state workers, they are particularly happy in spirit. Capitalists who have not been transformed into state-owned are very envious of them.
    Employees are even more satisfied. Their working conditions have improved compared to the past, and some have also received wage increases. Their enthusiasm has greatly increased compared to before. Worker Sheng Baojiang proposed the suggestion of self-delivery of sacks and flour bags in the movement to increase production and practice economy, saving the state a lot of transportation costs.
    From the perspective of the state, after the consignment store is transformed into a state-owned grain store outlet, the advantages are more obvious. During consignment sales, each employee only supplied food to 500 people, but now it has increased to 1,000 people, and work efficiency has doubled. On the contrary, expenses have decreased. After the nineteen consignment stores in the eighth district became state-owned grain store outlets, the state's monthly expenditure was more than 3,000 yuan less than before consignment sales. At the same time, the state grain department implemented direct management of these grain stores, and the work in the store has also been improved compared to the past. The contradictions that existed during consignment sales have been completely resolved.
    The experience of these thirty grain consignment stores in Tianjin is a vivid and profound education for private industrialists and merchants: Now, our motherland is striding towards socialism, and the general trend is that capitalist ownership will eventually be replaced by socialist public ownership. However, as individuals who are members of the bourgeoisie, as long as they love the country and abide by the law, recognize this law of development, and actively adapt to this law, they will be able to find a place to live, have the opportunity to exert their talents, have a bright future, and have a happy new life!

    进一步做好改造资本主义工商业的工作
    私营粮店变成了国营粮店门市部
    何卓
    今年四五月间，天津市有三十家私营粮食零售商完成了社会主义改造，变成了国营粮店的门市部。资本家、业主和职工们一起，变成了国家的工作人员。
    天津解放初期，私营粮商可以从市场上自由进货，国家粮食公司对零售阵地还没有占领。于是，一些私营粮食零售商便同批发商勾结在一起，囤积拒售，追求暴利，扰乱市场，带头提高物价；并且用“掺假掺杂、以次顶好、克扣斤秤”的办法来欺骗和剥削消费者。
    从一九五二年下半年开始，社会主义经济的力量日益强大，国家拥有雄厚的粮食储备，牌价长期不变，某些私营粮商再想在市场上兴风作浪、扰乱物价，已经不可能了。同时，国家粮食零售公司和合作社又增设了许多新售粮点，群众当然信任不会弄虚作假、不会欺骗他们的国营粮店，于是，私营粮店的生意就一天比一天冷落起来。
    天津市的私营粮商就是这样地上了社会主义改造的第一课：在工人阶级领导的新中国，私营工商业者要想继续保持损人利己、投机取巧的资本主义经营方式，同社会主义经济力量抗争，路就会越走越窄，以至难于维持自己的存在。
    一九五三年十一月，国家实行粮食统购统销政策，天津市的私营粮食零售商全部改造成为国家的粮食代销店，全行业纳入了国家资本主义轨道。
    变成了国家的粮食代销店，给资本家们解决了一个历史上从来没有能够解决的问题——收入固定了，职业有保障了。永祥生粮店的经理刘魁吾说：
  “我开的那家粮店，到快解放的时候就被挤垮了，解放后才又筹钱开了这个店。现在变成了国家的代销店，生意完全有了保证。每个月经我们这个店要卖出去上十万斤粮。国家给的手续费完全够开支。私营的时候，手里头钱有限，买了小米缺白面，买了白面缺玉米。买粮的时候发愁，买回来卖不出去也发愁，远没有现在省心。”刘魁吾这些话，反映了中小资本家的真实体会。有些小资本家和小业主，平时完全靠借债做生意，转成代销店后，每月给国家代销几万斤粮食，还能取得一定的手续费。这些人更是从心底感激，说全凭国家救了自己。
    粮店里增加了社会主义，减少了资本主义，自然就会发挥它对国计民生的有利作用，抑制了不利的因素。国家实行粮食统购统销政策以后，全天津市二百多万人口的食粮供应工作组织得有条不紊，私营粮食代销店起了很大的作用。实行代销之后，粮店的经营管理工作也改善了。过去私营粮店卖的天津市民的主要粮食——玉米面，总是有砂子，磨牙，代销后国家用精选的玉米统一加工，改善磨面的方法，玉米面变得好吃了。过去私营粮店的粮食品种不全，经营什么粮食由利润大小来决定，各种豆子（所谓冷背货）价格尤其抬得高。现在不但品种齐全，而且明码实价。去年天津发大水，市民们反映：这次的水比一九三九年大得多，如果国家不把这些私营粮店管理起来，不实行粮食统购统销政策，不知道要饿死多少人呢！
    粮食代销店比起私营粮店来，无论是对国对民，对公对私，好处都要多得多了。但是，这只是初步的改造，有些资本家要损人利己，总还有空子可钻，同社会主义的计划经济总还有矛盾。例如，国家的要求是在合理供应的基础上尽量节约粮食。但是代销店为了多得手续费，想尽量多卖粮食，有不少粮店经常超越规定的供应范围卖粮，有的资本家甚至煽动居民多报粮食需要量。国家的要求是按照每一家居民的实际需要有计划地供应粮食，但是有些代销店从中营私舞弊，给自己的亲戚朋友超过定量供应，给一般居民卖粮时克扣分量，据为己有。许多代销店还向国家虚报粮食损耗和粮店的开支。而且，由于私营粮商投机取巧的天性，国家不能把发放粮票的任务交给他们，国营粮店特别繁忙，居民则感到不便。同时，旧有的粮店很分散，分布得不均匀，许多粮店的设备简陋、铺面狭小，居民买粮和国家对代销店进行管理都不方便，职工的劳动条件也不好，在劳动力的使用、粮食的保管和运输方面都有浪费。天津市粮食局虽然对这些代销店进行了必要的合并、调整，但是因为这些代销店有的是劳资关系，有的是小业主，有的店大，有的店小，工资水平、管理费用也不一致，再加上彼此都是私营，合并调整的时候有很多困难，合并以后也常常因为利润的分配等问题闹不团结。
    这种种情况都说明：国家和人民的利益以及客观形势的发展，需要对私营粮食代销店的资本主义所有制、私人所有制，作进一步的改造。
    需要改变。也有改变的可能。
    国家资本主义性质的代销形式实行了一年多之后，进一步改造成为全民所有制的条件已经完全成熟了：第一、自由市场已不存在，代销店经营的商品——粮食，是国家统购统销的物资，全部要从国家进货，而且全部属于国家所有。资本家已经不可能私自进货，扩大经营。第二、代销店要根据划定的供应范围和消费者固定的需要量，按计划进货，按计划销售，卖钱额也已经不可能由资本家任意扩大。第三、代销店根据所销售的粮食数量向国家领取一定比例的手续费，利润固定，追求高额利润已经不可能。而且卖粮所得的款项当天解交银行，不可能利用来投机倒把。第四、原有的流动资金已交给了银行作为代销的保证金，资本家的资本已经不能再发挥资本的作用。第五、粮店由有国家粮食部门代表和职工代表参加的经营管理委员会领导，经营管理费用要经过审核批准，按计划开支。粮店的工作有职工和广大消费者群众进行日常的监督，如果资本家营私舞弊、服务态度不好，随时要受到揭发和批评。同时，这些粮店的资本额都比较小，一般的只有几百元，一千元以上的很少；而且职工人数不多，资本家一般都参加辅助劳动。在这种情况下，资本家们觉得：货源、卖钱额、利润、经营管理费用都纳入了国家的计划轨道，店里的工作和原有的资本也都由国家直接地或间接地管了起来，转成国营粮店之后，不仅光荣，而且可以免去给税务局交税、给粮食部门交表报等许多责任。他们从自己切身的体会感觉到：走上了国家资本主义道路，就有一只脚被带进了社会主义的门槛，而另一只脚也就非跟着进来不可。大势所趋，彻底完成社会主义改造这个结局是不可避免的。而转变成完全的社会主义所有制，对于个人来说，反而会带来从来没有享受过的轻松愉快。因此，他们普遍愿意转成国营粮店的门市部，有不少人主动地提出了申请。小业主和职工们觉得转成了国家的工作人员，个人的发展前途再不会受到限制，因此更加愿意转成国营。
    天津市粮食局分析了这些条件，便在今年五月间先选择了三十家经营作风和服务态度比较好的代销店，合并成了二十九个国营粮店的门市部。
    转成国营后，代销店的全部从业人员都得到了妥善的安置。有些有才能的职工和思想进步有经验的资本家被提升为门市部的领导人员。永祥生粮店的经理刘魁吾这次就被分配作经理区的经理，领导着五个门市部。有几个六十岁以上的老年职工和资本家，则动员他们退休养老，由子女代替就业。在安排中间，对人员的配备作了适当的调整。这些人转到国营门市部以后，资本家、小业主、职工的平均工资水平，都和原来差不多，而且比过去增加了公费医疗和家属治病半价等福利待遇。
    这三十家代销店转成国营粮店门市部以后，资本家、业主、职工，普遍感到满意。资本家们觉得过去担子很重，什么都要自己负责，经常耽心发愁，工作休息也没有定时。现在业务单纯了，还有机会上业余学校提高文化，觉得比过去省心得多。特别是成了国家的工作人员，精神上特别愉快。没有转成国营的资本家，都十分羡慕他们。
    职工们更是满意。他们的劳动条件比过去改善了，有的还增加了工资，积极性都比以前大为提高。工人盛宝江在增产节约运动中提出了自送麻袋、面袋的建议，给国家节省了不少运费。
    从国家来说，代销店转成国营粮店门市部以后，优越性表现得更加明显。代销的时候，每一个从业人员只供应五百人的食粮，现在增加到了一千人，工作效率提高了一倍。相反，开支却减少了。第八区十九家代销店变成国营粮店门市部以后，每月国家的支出比代销前减少了三千多元。同时，国家粮食部门对这些粮店实行了直接的管理，店里的工作也比过去改进了，代销的时候存在的矛盾已经全部解决。
    天津市这三十家粮食代销店的经历，对私营工商业者是一个生动的深刻的教育：现在，我们的祖国正在大踏步地向着社会主义迈进，大势所趋，资本主义所有制终将为社会主义的全民所有制所代替。但是，作为资产阶级分子的个人，只要他爱国守法，认识这个发展规律，主动地适应这个规律，那他就能够得到安身之所，得到发挥自己才能的机会，有光明的前途，有愉快的新生活！
