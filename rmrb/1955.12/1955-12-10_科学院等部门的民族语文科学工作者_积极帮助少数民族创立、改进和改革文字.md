Ethnic language scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other departments have achieved great results in helping ethnic minorities create, improve, and reform writing systems in recent years.

　　In September 1954, in order to help the Zhuang people, the most populous ethnic minority in China, create a writing system, the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Writing Research Steering Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region jointly organized a Zhuang language work team. They conducted a comprehensive survey and comparative study of Zhuang dialects and collected relevant materials. After determining the basic dialect and standard pronunciation, they drafted a preliminary phonetic writing system plan, which is now being prepared for experimentation starting next year. Prior to this, researchers from the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also cooperated with Yi intellectuals to create a new Yi script using the Latin alphabet in Sichuan, which has already begun to be used. More than 7,000 Yi adults and school children have already learned the new Yi script. In addition, in the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province and the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, two Dai script improvement plans have been completed and are ready for experimentation and implementation. Preliminary improvement plans have also been developed for the scripts of the Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz peoples in Xinjiang, and the Lisu, Jingpo, and Lahu peoples in Yunnan. The reform of the Mongolian script is entering the preparation stage.

　　In recent years, the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and related departments have successively sent four long-term language work teams to Sichuan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces to conduct research on Yi dialects and Yi script, Zhuang dialects and Buyi dialects. They conducted research on the dialects and original scripts of the Dai, Jingpo, and Lisu areas, the Hani areas, and some Yi settlements in Yunnan. They conducted research on the Lahu, Kawa, Blang, Achang, Nong, Sha, and Western Tibetan languages, as well as Miao dialects. This work is of great importance for helping ethnic minorities in these areas create, improve, and reform writing systems.

　　This year, the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also jointly formed language survey teams with the Central University for Nationalities and language research institutions in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang. They went to Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hebei, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to conduct research. The former has already put forward opinions on the division of Mongolian dialects in our country and studied the Daur, Tu, and Dongxiang languages. The latter focused on conducting research on Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz languages, and also conducted preliminary research on Xibe and Tajik languages. This work provides materials for the creation, improvement, and reform of writing systems for the above-mentioned ethnic groups.

    科学院等部门的民族语文科学工作者
    积极帮助少数民族创立、改进和改革文字
    中国科学院语言研究所和有关部门的民族语文科学工作者几年来在帮助少数民族创立、改进和改革文字工作方面取得了很大成绩。
    一九五四年九月，为了帮助中国少数民族中人口最多的僮族创立文字，中国科学院语言研究所和桂西僮族自治区文字研究指导委员会共同组织了僮语工作队，对僮语方言作了全面的调查和比较研究，并搜集了有关材料，确定基础方言和标准音以后，拟订了初步的拼音文字方案，现在正准备明年起进行试验。在这以前，中国科学院语言研究所的研究人员还和彝族知识分子合作，在四川创立了一种用拉丁字母拼音的新彝文，并已经开始使用。彝族成年人和在校儿童已经学会新彝文的有七千多人。还有，在云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区和西双版纳傣族自治州，已经完成两种傣文的改进方案，并准备试验和推行；新疆的维吾尔族和哈萨克族、柯尔克孜族和云南的傈僳族、景颇族、拉祜族的文字也有了初步的改进方案；蒙文的改革工作，正进入准备阶段。
    几年来中国科学院语言研究所和有关部门先后派出四个长期性的语言工作队分别到四川、广西、云南、贵州等省，对彝语方言和彝文、僮语方言和布依语方言进行了调查研究。对云南的傣族地区、景颇族和傈僳族地区、哈尼族地区以及一部分彝族聚居区的方言和原有文字进行了调查研究，对拉祜语、佧瓦语、布朗语、阿昌语、侬语、沙语和西蕃语进行了调查研究，还对苗语方言进行了调查研究。这些工作对帮助各该地少数民族创立、改进和改革文字，有重要作用。
    今年中国科学院语言研究所还同中央民族学院及内蒙古、新疆的语文研究机构合组了语言调查队，分别到内蒙古自治区、热河、吉林、黑龙江、甘肃、青海等省和新疆维吾尔自治区进行调查研究工作。前者已经提出关于划分我国蒙古语方言的意见，并研究了达呼尔、土族、东乡三种语言。后者对维吾尔语、哈萨克语、柯尔克孜语重点地作了调查研究，还对锡伯语和塔吉克语进行了初步的调查。这些工作对上述各民族创立，改进和改革文字，提供了材料。
