    A Grain Depot that Wastes Grain
    To the Editors:
    The Datian District Grain Depot in Chaling County, Hunan Province, is a place that wastes grain. The phenomenon of grain becoming moldy and infested with insects is very serious here.

    In April of this year, when the higher authorities were transferring grain, they discovered that the walls of this grain depot were covered with moldy grain, and the grain near the ground was also moldy. The storekeeper, Liu Zhihua, fearing investigation and responsibility, secretly washed and dried the grain and sold it to the farmers. The people who bought the grain are still cursing to this day. During the cleaning of the warehouse in April this year, storekeeper Zeng Xiangshan discovered that some of the 600,000 jin of grain had become moldy. He actually mixed the rotten grain into the good grain and transferred it out.

    These facts have not attracted the attention of the grain depot staff. In late September, this grain depot discovered that 36 bags of grain were half moldy, and 5-inch-long sprouts had grown in the middle of the sacks. If the higher authorities had not come to transfer grain, who knows when this situation would have been discovered! In addition, the twelve warehouses, containing 370,000 jin of grain, were full of moths and aphids. According to a preliminary inspection by the inspection team, there were sixty to seventy insects per kilogram of grain (prevention and control measures are currently being implemented).

    The system at the Datian Grain Depot is also very chaotic. One person is responsible for collecting money and paying out grain for each warehouse, resulting in many malpractices. A temporary worker embezzled more than 1,300 jin of grain after working for only two months. Currently, more than 14,000 jin of rice have been lost in the grain depot, and after repeated investigations, its whereabouts are still unknown.

    I hope that the Chaling County Grain Bureau will quickly rectify the work of the Datian Grain Depot and give the relevant personnel the punishment they deserve.

### 一个糟蹋粮食的粮仓

    一个糟蹋粮食的粮仓编辑同志：
    湖南省茶陵县大田区粮仓是一个糟蹋粮食的地方。在这里，粮食霉烂、虫蚀的现象十分严重。
    今年四月，上级在调运粮食的时候，发现这个粮仓仓壁上满是霉谷，靠地面的粮食也都霉烂了。保管员刘志华怕追查责任，偷偷地把谷子洗晒了一下，卖给了农民。买到粮食的人，骂声到现在还没有停止。保管员曾向善在今年四月间清仓的时候发现六十万斤谷子中有一部分长了霉。他竟把烂谷掺入好谷里调运出去。
    以上这些事实，并没有引起粮仓工作人员的重视。九月下旬，这个粮仓又发现有三十六袋谷子霉烂了一半，麻袋中间还长出了五寸长的谷芽。如果不是上级来调运粮食，这个情况还不知道要什么时候才能被发现呢！另外，装有三十七万斤粮食的十二间仓房里，满是蛾虫和蚜虫。经检查组初步检验，每公斤粮食里就有虫六七十只（目前正在防治）。
    大田粮仓的制度也十分混乱。各仓收款、付穀是由一个人担任，因此弊端很多。一个临时工作人员只工作了二个多月，就贪污了一千三百多斤粮食。目前粮仓里还丢了一万四千多斤稻谷，经再三追查，仍然找不到着落。
    我希望茶陵县粮食局赶快整顿大田粮库的工作，并且给有关人员以应得的处分。
                                        谭开元
