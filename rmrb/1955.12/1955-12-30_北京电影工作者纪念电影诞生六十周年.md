Beijing film workers, more than 700 people, gathered on the evening of the 28th to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the birth of cinema.

Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture; Wang Lansi, Director of the Film Bureau; Cai Chusheng, Deputy Director; film scriptwriter Sun Qian; Wang Yang, director of the Beijing Film Studio who recently returned from studying in the Soviet Union; and famous director Cheng Yin, among others, attended the commemoration.

At the meeting, Wang Lansi, Director of the Film Bureau, delivered a speech. He said that sixty years ago, the young French scientist Louis Lumière screened the world's first film, "Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory," in a Paris theater, thus beginning the era of cinema.

He said that this brilliant achievement in the history of human arts and literature was the result of the efforts of scientists from various countries at the time, especially French scientists. This art form has greatly enriched human cultural life.

Wang Lansi reviewed the development of the film industry in the new China over the past six years, and called on film workers to strive to improve the quality of films to meet the growing cultural needs of socialist construction and the people.

Cai Chusheng mentioned in his speech that a famous French director is launching an international conference of film creators, and he said that Chinese film workers fully support the convening of this conference.

The meeting adopted a congratulatory telegram to French film workers.

After the meeting, the famous French film "Fanfan la Tulipe" was shown. (Xinhua News Agency)
