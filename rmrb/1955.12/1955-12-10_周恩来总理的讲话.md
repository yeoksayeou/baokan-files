Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech
Respected Premier Grotewohl, Respected Comrades of the Delegation, Comrades, Friends:

We are very honored that the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Premier Grotewohl, has come to our country for a visit at the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, I would like to express a warm welcome to our distinguished guests, respected Comrade Grotewohl and all the comrades of the delegation.

Although the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China are geographically far apart, our common cause and sincere friendship unite us closely. Our two countries were born almost at the same time. Since the birth of our respective countries, a brotherly relationship of friendly cooperation has been established between our two countries. Over the years, this relationship has been continuously consolidated and developed. The spirit of unity and mutual support has always run through the relations between our two countries. In July 1954, at the invitation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic, I had the honor of visiting the German Democratic Republic. The Premiers of our two countries issued a joint communiqué, affirming our common desire to strengthen friendly cooperation and strive for world peace. Since then, the socialist construction undertakings of our two countries have made greater progress, the friendly relations between our two countries have been further strengthened, and the struggle of the people of the world to ease international tensions has also achieved significant results. Therefore, at this time, we are able to receive Premier Grotewohl and the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic in Beijing, and once again exchange views on common issues concerning the interests of the two countries and the maintenance of world peace, which is not only particularly gratifying, but also of great significance.

In the past year or more, many new and significant changes favorable to peace have taken place in international life. In particular, the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April this year and the Four-Power Summit Conference held in Geneva in July have powerfully promoted the relaxation of international tensions, promoted mutual trust between countries, and created favorable conditions for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. In order to overcome the obstacles to the solution of the German question caused by the Western countries' ratification of the Paris Agreement and the inclusion of West Germany in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc , the Soviet Union, The Democratic Republic of Germany and other peace-loving countries have made a series of major efforts. The USSR and the German Democratic Republic held talks in Berlin and Moscow successively in July and September this year, and concluded a treaty of relations between the two countries. The Soviet Union has also established diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. These actions are obviously conducive to the rapprochement between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and create favorable conditions for the restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis. Not long ago, the German Democratic Republic, in its statements to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and to the German people, and the Soviet Union, in its proposals at the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference, both proposed the establishment of a European collective security system and the establishment of an All-German Committee to promote rapprochement between the two Germanys. Everyone who recognizes reality will realize that these proposals are reasonable and practical ways to solve the problem of the peaceful reunification of Germany, because they conform to the interests of European security and the national interests of all the German people. However, all these reasonable proposals have been rejected by the United States and other Western countries. They attempt to sacrifice the political and social achievements already achieved by the working people of the German Democratic Republic, revive militarism in all of Germany, and drag the entire Germany into an aggressive bloc. This conspiracy of the United States and other Western countries will certainly arouse the indignation of the peace-loving people of Germany and Europe, and is also resolutely opposed by the 600 million Chinese people. The Chinese government and the Chinese people have always supported the German people's unremitting efforts to establish a unified, peaceful, democratic and independent Germany. When the representative of the People's Republic of China attended the Warsaw Conference of European countries for safeguarding peace and security in Europe as an observer, he again explicitly expressed full support for the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance of the Eight European Countries. This treaty demonstrates the firm determination of peace-loving European countries to safeguard European peace and security. We believe that the strong German people, with the support of the peace-loving people of the world, will certainly be able to undertake the cause of unifying Germany, will certainly be able to choose the correct path of peaceful development of Germany, and the Western countries' attempt to impose their will on the German people is doomed to failure.

The German Democratic Republic is a strong bastion of German peace and democratic forces . The achievements of the Democratic Republic of Germany in socialist construction and in improving the material and cultural life of the working people have powerfully encouraged all the German people. The peaceful foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic has won the trust and support of all peace-loving peoples. Although some countries in the world are hostile to and do not recognize the German Democratic Republic, the existence and development of the German Democratic Republic is already an unchangeable fact. Moreover, we are deeply convinced that the German Democratic Republic will achieve greater development along the correct path it has chosen.

The Chinese people are very concerned about the great achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in all fields, and regard these achievements as the same as their own. The Chinese people have been, are, and will always be the most faithful friends of the German people. The German people can count on the full support of the Chinese people in their struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

For six years, the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic have forged an unbreakable brotherly friendship. The Chinese people have received tremendous assistance from the German Democratic Republic in their socialist construction. Premier, at this moment when we warmly welcome you, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, to express our heartfelt thanks to you, and through you, to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic, for your assistance to us.

We are deeply convinced that the friendly visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic will further deepen the friendship between our two countries, strengthen the strength of the peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, and will be conducive to peace in Europe, Asia and the world.

Dear comrades and friends , let us toast to the unbreakable friendship between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republi c, to the prosperity of the German Democratic Republic, and to the health of President Wilhelm Pieck, a friend beloved by the Chinese people and a leader beloved by the German people!

### 周恩来总理的讲话

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的总理同志、敬爱的代表团全体同志、同志们、朋友们：
    以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应中华人民共和国政府的邀请来到我国访问，我们感到非常荣幸。我谨代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向我们的贵宾，敬爱的格罗提渥同志和代表团全体同志们表示热烈的欢迎。
    德意志民主共和国同中华人民共和国虽然在地理上相距很远，但是共同的事业和真诚的友谊把我们紧紧地团结在一起。我们两个国家差不多是同时诞生的。自从我们各自的国家诞生以来，我们两国之间就建立了一种兄弟般的友好合作关系。几年以来，这种关系得到了不断的巩固和发展。团结一致和相互支持的精神始终贯穿在我们两国关系之中。一九五四年七月，应德意志民主共和国政府的邀请，我荣幸地访问了德意志民主共和国。我们两国总理发表了会谈公报，肯定了我们两国加强友好合作和争取世界和平的共同愿望。从那个时候以来，我们两国的社会主义建设事业又都有了更大的进展，我们两国间的友好关系已经进一步加强，全世界人民争取和缓国际紧张局势的斗争也取得了重大的成就。因此，在这个时候，我们能在北京接待格罗提渥总理和德意志民主共和国政府代表团，并且就有关两国利益和维护世界和平的共同问题再一次交换意见，不仅使人格外感到高兴，而且具有重要的意义。
    最近一年多以来，国际生活中发生了许多新的有利于和平的重大变化。特别是今年四月在万隆召开的亚非会议和七月在日内瓦召开的四国政府首脑会议，有力地推动了国际紧张局势的和缓，促进了国际间的相互信任，并且为和平协商解决国际争端创造了有利的条件。为了克服由于西方国家批准巴黎协定和把西德拉进北大西洋侵略集团所造成的解决德国问题的障碍，苏联、德意志民主共和国和其他爱好和平的国家曾经作了一系列的重大的努力。苏联和德意志民主共和国在今年七月和九月先后在柏林和莫斯科进行了会谈，缔结了两国关系条约。苏联又同德意志联邦共和国建立了外交关系。这些行动显然有助于德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的接近，为在和平民主的基础上恢复德意志的统一创造了有利的条件。不久以前，德意志民主共和国在对四国外长会议和对德国人民发表的声明中，苏联在日内瓦四国外长会议上所提出的建议中，都提出了建立欧洲集体安全体系和建立全德委员会以促进两个德国接近的建议。一切承认现实的人都会认识到，这些建议是解决德意志的和平统一问题的合理的切实可行的途径，因为它们既符合于欧洲安全的利益，也符合于全体德国人民的民族利益。但是，所有这些合理的建议都遭到了美国和其他西方国家的拒绝。它们妄图牺牲德意志民主共和国劳动人民已经取得的政治和社会的成果，在全德意志复活军国主义，并且把整个德意志拉入侵略集团。美国和其他西方国家的这个阴谋，当然要引起德国和欧洲爱好和平人民的愤慨，而且也是六万万中国人民所坚决反对的。中国政府和中国人民一贯支持德国人民为争取建立一个统一、和平、民主、独立的德国而作的不懈努力。中华人民共和国的代表以观察员身份出席欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全的华沙会议的时候，又明确表示完全支持欧洲八国的友好合作互助条约。这个条约表明了爱好和平的欧洲国家对于维护欧洲和平和安全的坚强决心。我们相信，坚强的德国人民在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，一定能够担当起统一德国的事业，一定能够选择和平发展德国的正确道路，西方国家把自己的意志强加于德国人民的妄想是注定要失败的。
    德意志民主共和国是德意志和平民主力量的坚强堡垒。德意志民主共和国在社会主义建设和改善劳动人民物质和文化生活方面的成就，都有力地鼓舞着全体德意志人民。德意志民主共和国的和平外交政策已经赢得了所有爱好和平的人民的信任和支持。尽管世界上某些国家敌视和不承认德意志民主共和国，但是德意志民主共和国的存在和发展已经是一个不可改变的事实。而且，我们深信，德意志民主共和国还会沿着已经选择的正确道路得到更大的发展。
    中国人民十分关怀德意志民主共和国在各方面取得的巨大成就，并且把这些成就看成同自己的成就一样。中国人民过去是，现在是，将来也永远是德国人民最忠实的朋友。德国人民在争取和平统一自己祖国的斗争中可以指望中国人民的全力支持。
    六年以来，中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国已经结成了牢不可破的兄弟友谊。中国人民在自己的社会主义建设中从德意志民主共和国那里得到了巨大的帮助。总理同志，在今天我们热烈欢迎你的这个时刻，请允许我代表中国政府和人民向你，并且通过你，向德意志民主共和国政府和人民，对你们给我们的援助，表示衷心的感谢。
    我们深信，德意志民主共和国政府代表团的友好访问，一定会进一步加深我们两国之间的友谊，增强以伟大的苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的力量，并且有利于欧洲、亚洲和世界的和平。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，让我们为中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的牢不可破的友谊，为德意志民主共和国的繁荣，为中国人民敬爱的朋友、德国人民敬爱的领袖威廉·皮克总统的健康干杯！
