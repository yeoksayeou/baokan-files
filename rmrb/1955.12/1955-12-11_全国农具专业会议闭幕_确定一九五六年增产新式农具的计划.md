Xinhua News Agency, December 10th. The National Agricultural Implement Conference, which concluded today, determined to produce more new-style animal-powered agricultural implements in 1956 than in previous years. Among them, the planned production of double-wheel double (single) ploughs is 2.36 million units, an increase of more than threefold compared to 1955. The output of agricultural implements such as disc harrows, tine harrows, seeders, and harvesters will all increase by two to three times in 1956 compared to 1955. The output of agricultural implements such as hillside plows, paddy field plows, rice threshers, and sweet potato slicers will increase by four to more than ten times in 1956 compared to 1955.

    Based on the new situation of the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement, this conference conducted specific research on issues such as expanding the variety of agricultural implements, improving the quality of agricultural implements, and reducing the production costs of agricultural implements. In order to meet the needs of rural areas for various agricultural implements and to prepare conditions for the future mass production of tractor-drawn agricultural implements, the conference decided that agricultural implement factories across the country should produce a total of more than 70 varieties of agricultural implements next year. Among them, Qiqihar Machinery Factory, Kaifeng Machinery Factory, Shandong Agricultural Implement Factory, Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory and other eleven factories should prepare to design or trial-produce more than ten kinds of tractor-drawn agricultural implements such as five-铧 plows, paddy field double-wheel double-铧 plows, and medium-sized threshers. The conference particularly emphasized ensuring the quality of agricultural implements, requiring agricultural implement factories in various regions to strictly produce agricultural implements in accordance with the quality standards specified in the drawings, and the quality can only be improved compared to this year, and not reduced compared to this year. At the same time, it also requires vigorously reducing product costs, among which eleven kinds of products such as double-wheel double (single) plows, seeders, disc harrows, tine harrows, harvesters, and waterwheels are required to reduce costs by 20% to 45% respectively on the basis of this year.

    The conference pointed out that although the task of producing agricultural implements in 1956 is very heavy, as long as the leadership of agricultural implement factories in various regions overcome conservative ideas, earnestly mobilize the broad masses of workers, and actively tap the potential capabilities of enterprises, there are sufficient conditions to complete the plan. According to the characteristics of the large-scale production of various agricultural implement factories next year, the conference requires factories to change their existing labor organizations and production methods that are only suitable for small-batch production according to different circumstances, organize specialized workshops or sections, and implement assembly line operations; at the same time, vigorously improve the process, and promote advanced operating methods. The conference pointed out that according to the experience of agricultural implement manufacturing factories in Beijing, Shandong and other places, as long as the existing labor organization is changed and advanced process is promoted, the production efficiency of agricultural implements can be greatly improved, and the product quality can also be guaranteed and the product costs can be reduced.

    This conference also studied the issue of how to formulate agricultural implement production plans according to the needs of agricultural cooperation. The conference called on the staff and workers of agricultural implement manufacturing factories in various regions to respond to the initiative of the staff and workers of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory and vigorously carry out labor emulation.

    This conference was convened by the Third Ministry of Machine Building on November 25. Representatives from the industrial departments (bureaus) of various provinces (cities) and the directors of major agricultural implement manufacturing factories across the country attended the conference. Representatives from relevant units such as the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Agriculture also attended the conference.

    全国农具专业会议闭幕
    确定一九五六年增产新式农具的计划
    新华社十日讯　今天闭幕的全国农具专业会议，确定在一九五六年内生产比往年更多的新式畜力农具。其中，双轮双（单）铧犁计划生产二百三十六万部，比一九五五年增长三倍以上；圆盘耙、钉齿耙、播种机和收割机等农具的产量，一九五六年都将比一九五五年增加两倍到三倍以上；山地犁、水田犁、打稻机、甘薯切片机等农具的产量，一九五六年比一九五五年增加四倍到十多倍。
    这次会议根据农业合作化运动大发展的新情况，对扩大农具品种、提高农具质量和降低农具生产成本等问题，作了具体研究。为了满足农村对各种各样农具的需要，同时为将来大量生产机引农具准备条件，会议确定明年全国各地农具厂共要生产七十多种农具品种，其中齐齐哈尔机械厂、开封机械厂、山东农具厂、湖南农业机械厂等十一个厂要准备设计或试制五铧犁、水田双轮双铧犁、中型脱谷机等十几种机引农具。会议特别强调要保证农具的质量，要求各地农具厂要严格按照图纸规定的质量标准生产农具，在质量上只能比今年提高，不能比今年降低。同时，还要求大力降低产品成本，其中双轮双（单）铧犁、播种机、圆盘耙、钉齿耙、收割机和水车等十一种产品，要求在今年的基础上分别降低成本百分之二十到四十五。
    会议指出：一九五六年生产农具的任务虽然十分繁重，但只要各地农具厂领导方面克服保守思想，认真发动广大职工，积极挖掘企业的潜在能力，完成计划是有充分条件的。会议根据明年各农具厂大量生产的特点，要求各厂根据不同情况改变现有的只适合于小批生产的劳动组织和生产方法，组织专业车间或工段，实行流水作业；同时大力改进工艺过程，推广先进的操作方法。会议指出：根据北京、山东等地农具制造工厂的经验，只要改变现有的劳动组织，推广先进工艺过程，农具的生产效率就可以大大提高，还可以保证产品质量，降低产品成本。
    这次会议对如何根据农业合作化的需要制定农具生产规划的问题，也作了研究。会议号召各地农具制造厂职工，响应北京农业机械厂职工的倡议，大力开展劳动竞赛。
    这次会议是第三机械工业部在十一月二十五日召开的。参加会议的有全国各省（市）工业厅（局）的代表和全国主要农具制造厂的厂长。第一机械工业部、农业部等有关单位也派代表出席了会议。
