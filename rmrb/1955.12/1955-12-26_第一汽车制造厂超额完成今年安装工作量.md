The First Automobile Works has exceeded its annual installation workload by 5 percent as of the 20th.

The amount of installation work completed by the First Automobile Works this year accounts for more than half of the total installation workload since the factory's construction began three years ago. Adding to the portion completed last year, the First Automobile Works has completed approximately four-fifths of the total installation workload.

The entire power center of the factory—the thermal power station—has been fully installed. Most of the industrial pipelines and cables connecting the power stations to the production workshops were also installed this year. Currently, eight basic production workshops have begun adjusting their production.

In order to ensure that all basic production workshops are fully put into adjustment production and begin producing cars next year, the employees of the First Automobile Works have particularly accelerated the construction of the three factories that are in the final stages of installation, namely, the foundry, motorcycle, and stamping factories. The motorcycle factory actually installed more than twice as many machine tools this year as planned for the year.

    第一汽车制造厂超额完成今年安装工作量
    第一汽车制造厂到二十日超额百分之五完成了全年的安装工作量。
    第一汽车厂今年完成的安装工作量，约占建厂三年以来全部安装工作量的一半以上。加上去年完成的一部分工作量，第一汽车厂已经完成全部安装工作量的五分之四左右。
    全厂的动力中心——热电站已经全部安装完毕。各动力站通往各生产厂房的工业管道和电缆也大部在今年内安装起来。目前，有八个基本生产车间开始调整生产。
    第一汽车厂的职工，为了保证全厂所有基本生产车间明年全部投入调整生产和开始生产汽车，今年以来特别加快了最后安装的铸工、摩托、冲压三座工场的建设。摩托工场今年实际安装的机床比年计划多一倍以上。
