Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

The Hunan Provincial Inland Waterway Navigation Bureau wrote to accept the criticism regarding "Serious Water Transport Accidents in Certain Areas of Hunan Province" published on the "Letters from Readers" page on October 30th; and stated that they would strengthen safety education for navigation personnel, strengthen the socialist transformation of wooden sailboats, and establish practical and feasible safe production systems to ensure the safety of inland waterway navigation in all aspects.

The Luoyang Municipal Industrial Bureau wrote to accept the criticism of the Local State-Owned Luoyang Brick and Tile Factory regarding the destruction of cultural relics during capital construction, published on the "Letters from Readers" page on October 30th. They reviewed the mistake of one-sidedly emphasizing the urgency of the engineering task, blindly starting construction without detailed design and thorough exploration, which damaged valuable cultural relics and affected the quality of the project, and guaranteed to prevent this phenomenon in the future.

The Ministry of Railways has instructed the New Railway Construction Engineering Bureau to seriously check the situation of important tunnel construction equipment that has been backlogged for a long time (the original letter of criticism was published on the "Letters from Readers" page on November 21st). According to the inspection by the New Railway Construction Engineering Bureau, the main reason for this problem is that the relevant personnel have a low level of enterprise management, a poor sense of political responsibility, and a lack of an overall concept. They expressed that they would earnestly accept this lesson, improve their work, and actively find ways to deal with the backlogged battery locomotives and mechanical parts.

A letter from the Fourth Engineering Company of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry: The criticism from readers Yao Shangwen and Bai Shangqian regarding our company's main plant workshop's violation of national labor laws by illegally working overtime (see "Letters from Readers" page on November 6th) is correct. In the future, we are determined to start by strengthening enterprise management and improving labor organization, so that the construction tasks can be completed evenly, and ensure that we will no longer use the wrong method of working overtime to rush tasks.

The Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant wrote: After seeing the criticism of the serious equipment accidents in our factory on the "Letters from Readers" page on November 6th, we immediately convened relevant equipment management personnel and technical directors of various workshops to conduct research together. Everyone accepted this criticism and has already formulated four measures to prevent machine tool accidents in the future.

The director of the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant, Ma Zhaolong, wrote: The "Letters from Readers" page on November 27th exposed the bad phenomenon of many employees in our plant borrowing public funds for a long time. In the past, I rarely asked about this issue and only pushed it to the administrative deputy director and the accounting department to manage. This bureaucratic and liberal attitude is extremely wrong. Now we have given the relevant derelict personnel punishments and have taken strict measures to eliminate the chaotic phenomenon of borrowing money.

After the "Letters from Readers" page on September 28th published the letter of criticism "Why are the Sugarcane Seedlings Missing in the Liberation Agricultural Cooperative This Year?", the Neijiang Prefectural Office of the Sichuan Provincial Cooperative Union and the Jianyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative have written to make self-criticisms.

    洛阳市工业局来信接受十月三十日“读者来信专页”对地方国营洛阳砖瓦窑厂在基本建设中破坏文物的批评。他们检讨了片面强调工程任务紧急，没有进行详细设计和周密钻探就盲目施工，以致损坏了宝贵的文物和影响了工程质量的错误，保证在今后防止这种现象。
    铁道部已经责成新建铁路工程总局认真检查长期积压隧道施工的重要设备的情况（原批评信刊十一月二十一日“读者来信专页”）。据新建铁路工程总局的检查，发生这个问题的主要原因是，有关人员企业管理水平不高，政治责任心差，缺乏整体观念。他们表示要认真接受这个教训，改进工作，并且积极设法处理积压的电瓶机车和机械配件。
    重工业部建筑局第四工程公司来信：读者姚尚文、白尚谦对我公司主厂房工段违反国家劳动法令非法加班加点的批评（见十一月六日“读者来信专页”）是正确的。今后我们决心从加强企业管理，改善劳动组织等方面着手，使施工任务均衡地完成，保证不再用加班加点的错误方法来抢任务。
