The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee have recently issued consecutive instructions, requiring Party committees and governments at all levels to immediately take measures to protect young and weak livestock.

The main measures proposed by the Shandong Provincial Committee and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee are: First, promptly publicize the policy of protecting and developing draught animals to cadres, cooperative members, and peasant masses, criticize the erroneous thinking of not cherishing old, young, and female animals, and lead the masses to calculate the burden of animal power, explaining that it is not that there are too many livestock now, but that there is a shortage of animal power. Second, draught animals owned by the collective must be reasonably priced. In areas where cattle prices have fallen significantly, they should be evaluated at a reasonable annual price that is lower than the spring price but higher than the current price, adhering to the principle of considering both public and private interests, and agreeing on the term, ratio, and interest method of repayment in installments. Third, agricultural cooperatives should make reasonable arrangements for draught animals owned collectively within the cooperative and draught animals owned privately by members, protect female and young animals, and make full use of old and weak draught animals that can be used. Fourth, agricultural cooperatives should calculate detailed accounts of the fodder required for public and private draught animals, raise sufficient fodder, and encourage members to invest fodder in the cooperative. Fifth, attach importance to the winter protection of draught animals, launch a livestock-loving movement among members, increase cold-proof equipment, improve feeding management, and ensure that draught animals safely survive the winter. In addition, corresponding measures have also been proposed for the inter-regional regulation of draught animals and market management.

Recently, agricultural cooperatives in many areas have only wanted public, strong animals and not old, young, or female animals, resulting in a shortage of animal power in agricultural cooperatives and a large number of farmers selling old, young, and female animals, which is very detrimental to the development of agricultural cooperative production. The measures taken by the Shandong Provincial Committee and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee to protect livestock are timely and necessary.

    保护幼小和老弱牲畜
    中共山东省委和省人民委员会最近连续发出指示，要求各级党委、政府，立即采取措施，保护幼小和老弱牲畜。
    山东省委和省人民委员会提出的主要措施有：一、迅速向干部、社员和农民群众，宣传保护和发展耕畜的政策，批判不爱惜老、幼畜和母畜的错误思想，领导群众算畜力负担账，说明现在不是牲畜多了而是畜力不足。二、对归社公有的耕畜，必须合理作价。在牛价下跌较大的地区，应该按照低于春季价格高于现价的常年合理价格评价，本公私兼顾原则，议定分期偿还的年限、比数和行息办法。三、农业合作社对社内公有耕畜和社员私有耕畜实行合理安排，对母畜、幼畜加以保护，对可以使用的老弱耕畜充分利用。四、农业合作社计算公私耕畜需要饲草饲料的细账，筹足草料，鼓励社员向社投资草料。五、重视冬季耕畜保护工作，发动社员开展爱畜运动，增加防寒设备，改善饲养管理，确保耕畜安全过冬。此外，对耕畜的地区间的调剂，市场管理等工作，也提出了相应的措施。
    最近不少地区的农业合作社只要公畜壮畜不要老、幼畜和母畜，造成了农业合作社畜力不足和农民大批出卖老、幼畜和母畜的现象，这对农业合作社生产的发展很不利。山东省委和省人民委员会采取的保护牲畜的措施是及时的和必要的。
