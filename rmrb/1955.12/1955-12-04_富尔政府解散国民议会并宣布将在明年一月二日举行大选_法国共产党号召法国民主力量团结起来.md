Xinhua News Agency, Paris dispatch: The Faure government issued an order on the morning of December 2nd to dissolve the National Assembly. This order was signed by French President Coty late on the 1st. On the same evening, it was announced that France would hold general elections on January 2nd next year.

The right-wing parties in France are now quite alarmed, fearing that the current electoral law, which allows parties to form alliances, may be unfavorable to them, because the desire of the French people to change the political direction of recent years has strengthened, which could promote the broad unity of democratic forces; while the divisions between the right-wing parties and within the various factions of the parties are becoming increasingly serious.

On the eve of the issuance of the order dissolving the National Assembly, the National Executive Committee of the Radical Socialist Party, controlled by Faure's rival, the Mendès France faction, issued a communique on the evening of the 1st, announcing the expulsion of Faure from the party because he insisted on holding early elections despite the current electoral system remaining unchanged. On the same day, five Radical Socialist Party ministers of the Faure government resigned to protest the decision to dissolve the National Assembly.

The Secretary of the French Communist Party, Fajon, published an article in "L'Humanité," calling on all democratic forces in France to unite. He pointed out that in many respects it is now possible to reach agreements between Communists, Socialists, and other Republicans, in the struggle to raise the wages of the working people, to protect the interests of working farmers, on a policy of negotiations in North Africa, and in the struggle for peace, etc.

    富尔政府解散国民议会并宣布将在明年一月二日举行大选
    法国共产党号召法国民主力量团结起来
    据新华社讯巴黎消息：富尔政府十二月二日上午发布了解散国民议会的命令，这个命令已经在一日深夜由法国总统戈蒂签字。同日晚上宣布：法国将在明年一月二日举行大选。
    法国右翼政党现在都相当惊慌，害怕允许各政党结成联盟的现行选举法可能对它们不利，因为法国人民群众要求改变近几年来的政治方针的愿望加强了，这就能够促使民主力量广泛地团结起来；而各右翼政党之间和政党内部各派系之间的分裂却愈来愈严重。
    在解散国民议会的命令发布前夕，由富尔的党内劲敌孟戴斯—弗朗斯派所控制的激进社会党全国执行委员会在一日晚上发表公报，宣布开除富尔出党，因为他在现行选举制度不变的情况下仍然坚持提前大选。同日，富尔政府的五个激进社会党部长向富尔辞职，以示抗议决定解散国民议会。
    法国共产党书记法戎在“人道报”上发表文章，号召法国一切民主力量团结起来。他指出：在许多方面目前已经可能在共产党人、社会党人和其他共和分子之间达成协议，这些方面是：争取提高劳动人民的工资的斗争，保护劳动农民的利益，在北非进行谈判的政策，争取和平的斗争等等。
