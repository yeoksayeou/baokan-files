Xinhua News Agency, 6th. All provinces have successively formulated comprehensive plans for carrying out farmers' spare-time education and eliminating illiteracy, determining the speed and steps for eliminating illiteracy. The plans generally stipulate that illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in rural areas should be basically or completely eliminated during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

In its plan, Jiangsu Province has determined that illiteracy among young and middle-aged farmers in the province can be basically eliminated by 1960. From this winter to 1960, 13 million people will be organized to enroll in batches, eliminating 11 million illiterate and semi-illiterate people, accounting for 80 percent of the total number of illiterate and semi-illiterate young and middle-aged people in the province. Hubei Province has decided to eliminate 7.68 million to 8.9 million illiterate people by 1962, reaching 80 percent of the total number of illiterate young and middle-aged people in the province. More than 16 million illiterate young and middle-aged people in rural Henan Province will be enrolled in batches before 1958, and illiteracy can be basically eliminated by 1961. By 1962, Hunan Province will enable all of the more than 10 million illiterate young and middle-aged people in rural areas throughout the province to get rid of illiteracy. From this winter to 1962, Shandong Province will eliminate illiteracy among 13.64 million young and middle-aged people in rural areas, accounting for 80 percent of the total number of illiterate young and middle-aged people in Shandong Province. Jilin Province has decided to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in rural areas in stages and batches over the next seven years. By 1962, it will also enable more than 860,000 elderly illiterate farmers to become literate. During the First Five-Year Plan period, it will strive to organize 200,000 farmers to study in senior primary school classes. By 1962, Shaanxi Province will eliminate more than 95 percent of illiterate young and middle-aged people in the province. Among them, more than 2 million young and middle-aged farmers will improve their education to the level of senior primary school graduates after reaching the literacy standard. Gansu Province plans to have half of the 4.4 million illiterate young and middle-aged people eliminated by 1962 study in senior primary school classes. Liaoning, Hebei, Fujian and other provinces will also basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in rural areas in the next seven years.

In order to ensure the completion of the literacy task, Shandong Province will widely mobilize rural educated youth to participate in literacy teaching. It plans to organize and train a literacy army of 2 million people in seven years, and cultivate 100,000 mass teacher group leaders as teaching backbones. The number of mass teachers should often reach 400,000 to 600,000. Henan Province called on 120,000 primary school teachers and more than 5 million students above the third grade of primary school in rural areas throughout the province to participate in literacy teaching work during their spare time. Fujian Province is also preparing to organize a literacy team of 400,000 to 500,000 people. Jiangsu Province expects that 700,000 junior high school and senior primary school graduates who will be put into agricultural production in 1956 and 1957 will become the main force in literacy.

In the literacy plans, all provinces will gradually promote the experience of agricultural production cooperatives in running farmers' spare-time schools. By 1957, Shaanxi Province can basically ensure that agricultural production cooperatives with a relatively solid foundation have farmers' spare-time schools, and most newly established agricultural production cooperatives will also establish study groups. Henan Province will also focus on pilot projects for farmers' spare-time middle schools in large agricultural production cooperatives with conditions. Jiangsu, Henan and other provinces also stipulate that literacy should first start among village cadres, agricultural production cooperative cadres and activists. Henan Province plans to first eliminate illiteracy among existing township-level main cadres during the First Five-Year Plan period by adopting methods such as short-term off-the-job study for cadres and guaranteed teaching and learning. Shandong Province also plans to massively develop "work-recording study groups" throughout the province, requiring that by the end of 1956, "work-recording study classes" should be universally established in agricultural production cooperatives with a foundation, as the junior classes of farmers' spare-time schools.

    各省全面规划农村扫盲工作
    将广泛动员农村知识青年参加教学工作
    新华社六日讯　各省已经陆续制定出开展农民业余教育扫除文盲的全面规划，确定了扫除文盲的速度和步骤。规划中一般都确定在第二个五年计划期间内，基本上扫除或全部扫除农村青年和壮年中的文盲。
    江苏省在规划中确定一九六零年就可以基本上扫除全省青年和壮年农民中的文盲，从今年冬季开始到一九六零年分批组织一千三百万人入学，扫除一千一百万名文盲和半文盲，占全省农村青年和壮年文盲和半文盲总数的百分之八十。湖北省决定在一九六二年前扫除文盲七百六十八万到八百九十万人，达到全省农村青年和壮年文盲总数的百分之八十。河南省农村青年和壮年中现有的一千六百多万名文盲将在一九五八年以前分批入学，到一九六一年可以基本扫除文盲。湖南省到一九六二年将使全省农村青年和壮年中的一千多万名文盲全部摆脱文盲状态。山东省从今年冬季开始到一九六二年，将扫除农村青年和壮年中的文盲一千三百六十四万人，占山东省农村青年和壮年中文盲总数的百分之八十。吉林省确定在今后七年内分期分批扫除农村青年和壮年文盲，到一九六二年，还要使八十六万多老年农民文盲识字，在第一个五年计划期间，争取组织二十万农民进高小班学习。陕西省到一九六二年将在全省扫除百分之九十五以上的青年和壮年中的文盲，其中有二百多万名青年和壮年农民在达到扫盲标准以后，还将提高到高小毕业的文化程度。甘肃省计划到一九六二年扫除的四百四十万青年和壮年中的文盲，其中将有半数进高小班学习。辽宁、河北、福建等省都将在今后七年内基本扫除农村青年和壮年中的文盲。
    为了保证完成扫盲任务，山东省将广泛动员农村知识青年参加扫盲识字教学工作，准备在七年内组织和训练二百万人的扫盲大军，并且要培养十万个群众教师小组长作为教学骨干，群众教师的数量要经常达到四十万到六十万人。河南省号召全省农村中十二万名小学教师和五百多万名小学三年级以上的学生利用课余时间，参加扫盲教学工作。福建省也准备组织一支四、五十万人的扫盲队伍。江苏省预计在一九五六到一九五七年投入农业生产的七十万名初中和高小毕业生，将成为扫盲中的主要力量。
    各省在扫盲规划中将逐步推广由农业生产合作社来举办农民业余学校的经验。陕西省到一九五七年可以基本上作到比较有基础的农业生产合作社都设立农民业余学校，大部分新成立的农业生产合作社也将建立学习组。河南省还将在有条件的大型农业生产合作社内重点试办农民业余中学。江苏、河南等省并规定首先从乡村干部、农业生产合作社干部和积极分子中开始扫盲，河南省计划在第一个五年计划期间内，采取干部短期离职学习、包教保学等办法，首先扫除现有乡一级主要干部中的文盲。山东省并且计划在全省大量发展“记工学习组”，要求到一九五六年年底，在有基础的农业生产合作社内，普遍建立“记工学习班”，作为农民业余学校的初级班。
