    The Key Lies in Strengthening Leadership Over New Product Trial Manufacturing
    By Our Correspondent Lù Hào
    New product trial manufacturing has increasingly become an extremely important link in China's socialist construction. However, at present, this link is still a weak one.
    According to the materials from 46 factories statistically analyzed by the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Statistics by the end of September: Only 21 factories have fully completed their new product trial manufacturing plans; 25 factories have not completed their trial manufacturing plans, and the trial manufacturing plans of 4 factories have completely failed. Of the 19 most important electromechanical enterprises in Liaoning Province, a cumulative total of 260 new product trial manufacturing plans were scheduled for the first three quarters of 1955, but only 185 were completed by the end of September. Among them, none of the five heavy machinery factories undertaking key project trial manufacturing tasks completed their trial manufacturing plans. By the end of September, they had only completed half of the cumulative plan, and one-third of the new products had no finished products at all.
    The failure to complete the new product trial manufacturing plan on schedule will seriously affect the progress of socialist construction. Many key projects have had to be delayed in construction and factory production because new equipment has not arrived on time. Some new products are being developed through division of labor and cooperation between several factories. Because one of the factories cannot complete the new product trial manufacturing plan, other factories have had to suspend work and wait for materials. The Dalian Crane Factory, the Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory, and the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory alone have caused the production and construction of 31 units, including Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, to fail to proceed on schedule because the plans for new products have not been completed. The poor implementation of a factory's new product trial manufacturing plan not only affects the normal work of many other departments, but also seriously affects the factory's own construction. For example, in the third quarter, the high-quality steel plates supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel Company to the Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory were of low quality, causing the Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory to rework the mixer furnace for Anshan Iron and Steel midway, resulting in the failure of the trial manufacturing plan, and Anshan Iron and Steel Company was unable to obtain new equipment as planned.
    Why is the new product trial manufacturing work not progressing well?
    This is because some factory leaders only like old products and do not like new products very much. The reason why they are reluctant to part with old products and lack enthusiasm for new products is that, in their view, producing old products is stable and smooth, and there is no need to take any risks to complete the production tasks; but trial manufacturing of new products requires starting from scratch, which is very troublesome, and if things go wrong, the production tasks will be affected. Such people, even if they reluctantly accept the trial manufacturing of new products, are only willing to do simple and easy ones, and are unwilling to do complex and difficult ones; they are willing to do ones with high output value, but not very willing to do ones with low output value; they are willing to do ones in batches and in large quantities, but not willing to do ones in small batches, and even less willing to do one or two pieces. As a result, very few of the products urgently needed by the state are made; while many of the products that the state does not urgently need for the time being are made. The Shenyang Transformer Factory once put aside the more difficult-to-manufacture new product, the special transformer, when it saw that it could not complete the total output value plan, and single-mindedly produced more other old products. Some factory leaders have not thought that if our factories can only produce some old products every year and cannot produce new products based on the new achievements of science and technology, then it will be difficult to realize socialist industrialization. They do not understand that trial manufacturing of new products is a severe test for the factory and the factory leaders themselves. The more new products are trial manufactured, the faster the enterprise's technical and management level will improve, and the fewer new products are trial manufactured, the slower the enterprise's technical and management level will improve.
    Some factory leaders lack sufficient ideological and organizational preparation for the transition from machine repair work in old China to today's complex manufacturing work, and they do not fully recognize the complexity and difficulty of transforming old ideas, old technologies, and old management methods, thus causing great difficulties for new product trial manufacturing work. In old China, the quality of repair work was judged by looking with the eyes and listening with the ears. There was experience, but much of it was unscientific. Filing and hammering made it seem like any machine could be fiddled with, but in reality, it was just repaired to be able to turn. Some technicians and old workers have been dealing with repair work for decades, and now that they have changed, they lack preparation in all aspects, so they have brought a set of backward, handicraft-style methods from machine repair work to machine manufacturing work, which requires high technical conditions. They do not take a conscientious attitude towards new product trial manufacturing work, nor do they take a step-by-step, regular attitude, but instead want to run fast without knowing how to walk, and they rush to trial manufacture new products based on experience. In the work of trial manufacturing new products, they often do not proceed in order, they start on the process before the drawings are ready; they start tool manufacturing before the process is done; they are impatient to trial manufacture before the tool manufacturing is done; they start mass production before the trial manufacturing is successful. The result is a flood of defective products. The Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory once took such a detour. From 1952 until June 1954, almost all of the new products produced were substandard. When some of our factory leaders encounter this situation, they do not take an active revolutionary spirit, but instead procrastinate and drift with the tide. They do not actively participate in leading the trial manufacturing of new products, but instead take a blind and accommodating approach. As a result, Soviet drawings are modified at will, extremely valuable Soviet machine tools are damaged, and substandard new products are also released from the factory. When users say that there are problems with the finished products released from the factory, they say, "Users don't know how to use the new machines." How can we do a good job with such an attitude to trial manufacturing new products?
    Some factory leaders, after trial manufacturing and producing some new products in recent years, think that "trial manufacturing new products is just like that." They have developed a blindly complacent attitude towards the new product trial manufacturing work, which requires increasingly higher technical conditions. They hold a "contempt for the enemy" attitude towards the extremely difficult and complex new product trial manufacturing work. Therefore, they are complacent when the work is going smoothly; and they become impatient when the work encounters difficulties. The leading staff of the Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory, when trial manufacturing 50-ton open wagons, felt that even more complex special vehicles had been successfully manufactured, so what problems could there be? However, in reality, this batch of tasks was delayed for a long time and was not completed. The leading staff of the Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Factory also felt that they had made more sophisticated products when they started trial manufacturing Soviet-style 24-row seeders. They thought this was rough work that could be done by hammering and beating. They did not follow the trial manufacturing sequence, and started small-batch production at the beginning. When it came to assembly, they had to rework everything. From last year to September this year, they have never completed the state's new product trial manufacturing task. There is no doubt that our achievements in new product trial manufacturing are remarkable. Machines that old China never thought of doing are now being made in our hands. Machines that used to rely on imports from abroad can now be manufactured by ourselves, and some can even be exported. However, in this regard, our experience is still very little. With the rapid development of China's socialist construction, the tasks of the machine manufacturing industry are becoming more and more arduous. We will learn to manufacture the world's first-class machines with the help of the Soviet Union. We have only just taken the first step in the Long March, and we must not become complacent at the beginning, as this will delay our great cause.
    There are also some factory leaders who lack confidence. They say: The task of trial manufacturing new products is very glorious; but our technical strength is limited and we cannot do it. Of course, it should be admitted that China's current technical strength is weak and insufficient; but this does not mean that we have to sit down and wait until the technical strength is almost there before we start. Only through the trial manufacturing of new products can we continuously strengthen our technical strength and change the situation of weak technical strength more quickly. Here, we need to learn from the Soviet Union conscientiously. Facts have proved that as long as we work hard, as long as we learn conscientiously, we can catch up. This is what the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory has done. Although this factory has stumbled badly on the issue of trial manufacturing new products, since the autumn of last year, they have treated the work of trial manufacturing new products as a major event in the entire factory, mobilizing and educating all employees to modestly and actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In this way, the situation has changed greatly. Recently, a Soviet-style precision boring machine with 4,000 parts, each part having from several to dozens of processes, has been successfully manufactured. It can be seen from this that the lack of technical strength is indeed a difficulty, but as long as we learn from the Soviet Union honestly, the difficulty can still be overcome.
    There are, of course, many reasons for the difficulties in new product trial manufacturing, but the main reason is that the thinking of some factory leaders has not caught up with the urgent tasks put forward by national industrialization. In order to accelerate national industrialization, in order to enable China's machine manufacturing industry to meet the needs of national industrialization, strengthening ideological leadership over trial manufacturing new products is an urgent task.

### 关键在于加强对新产品试制的领导

    关键在于加强对新产品试制的领导
    本报记者　陆灏
    新产品试制工作在我国社会主义建设事业中已经日益成为一个极其重要的环节。但是，目前这个环节还是一个薄弱的环节。
    到九月底为止，根据辽宁省统计局统计的四十六个工厂的材料：全部完成新产品试制计划的只有二十一个工厂；没有完成试制计划的有二十五个工厂，其中有四个工厂的试制计划全部落空。辽宁省十九个最重要的机电企业，一九五五年一至三季度累计计划试制新产品二百六十种，到九月底，只完成了一百八十五种。其中五个担负重点工程试制新产品任务的重型机器厂，没有一个单位完成试制计划，到九月底止，仅完成累计计划的一半，还有三分之一的新产品，根本没有出成品。
    试制新产品的计划不能如期完成，这就会严重地影响社会主义建设事业的进行。有很多重点工程因为新的设备没按时来到，工程建设和工厂的生产只好延迟进行。有的新产品是几个工厂分工协作进行的，因为其中一个工厂不能完成试制新产品的计划，其他工厂也只好停工待料。仅大连起重机器厂、大连工矿车辆厂、沈阳高压开关厂等三个单位，因为新品种的计划没有完成，就使鞍山钢铁公司、第一汽车制造厂等三十一个单位的生产建设不能如期进行。一个工厂的试制新产品的计划执行得不好，它不但影响别的很多部门不能正常地工作，也严重地影响本身的建设，如鞍山钢铁公司第三季度对大连工矿车辆厂供应的优质钢板，因为质量低，使大连工矿车辆厂为鞍钢试制的混铁炉中途返工，试制计划落空，鞍山钢铁公司也就不能按计划得到新设备。
    为什么试制新产品的工作进行得不好？
    这是因为我们有些工厂的领导者只喜欢老产品，不大喜欢新产品。他们所以留恋老产品，对于新产品缺乏热情，是因为在他们看来，生产老产品，安安稳稳，顺顺当当，不需要承担什么风险，生产任务就能完成；而试制新产品呢，一切都要从头开始，很伤脑筋，弄不好，生产任务就受影响。这样的人，即使勉强接受了新产品的试制工作，也只愿意做简单的，容易做的，不愿意做复杂的，不容易做的；愿意做产值大的，不大愿意做产值小的；愿意做成批的、数量多的，不愿意做小批的，更不愿意做一件两件的。其结果常常是国家迫切需要的做得很少；而国家暂时不大迫切需要的，却做了很多。沈阳变压器厂曾经在眼看完不成总产值计划的时候，把比较难制造的新产品特殊变压器放下，而一味多生产别的旧产品。有些工厂的领导者没有想到：如果我们的工厂年年只能生产些老产品，而不能根据科学技术的新成就生产新产品，那末，就很难实现社会主义工业化。他们不懂得试制新产品，对工厂，对工厂的领导者本身，都是一个严厉的考验。试制的新产品多，企业的技术水平和管理水平的提高就快，试制的新产品少，企业的技术水平和管理水平的提高就慢。
    有些工厂的领导者，对于从旧中国的机器修配工作转变到今天复杂的制造工作，在思想上、组织上，缺乏充分的准备，对于改造旧的思想、旧的技术、旧的管理方法的复杂性艰苦性认识不足，因而使新产品的试制工作碰上了很大的困难。在旧中国，修配工作的质量是凭眼睛看和耳朵听的。经验是有的，但是有很多是不科学的。锉一锉、敲一敲，看起来，好像什么机器都会摆弄，实际上仅仅是修理得能转动罢了。有一部分技术人员和老工人，跟修配工作打过几十年的交道，现在一旦转变，各方面都缺乏准备，因而就把机器修配工作的一套落后的手工业式的办法带到技术条件要求很高的机器制造工作方面来了。他们对待新产品的试制工作，不是采取兢兢业业的态度，不是采取按步就班规规矩矩的态度，而是不会走路，就想快跑，草草率率地凭着经验试制新产品。他们在试制新产品的工作中，往往不是顺序前进，图纸还没有准备好，就搞工艺；工艺没有搞好，就搞工具制造；工具制造没有搞好，就性急地试制；试制没有成功，就大批制造。结果是废品泛滥。沈阳第二机床厂就曾经走过这样的弯路，从一九五二年开始直到一九五四年的六月以前，生产的新产品几乎全部是不合规格的。我们有的工厂领导人员碰到这种情形，不是采取积极的革命的精神，而是拖泥带水，随波逐流。他们不是积极地参与领导新产品的试制工作，而是采取了一种盲目的迁就的办法。结果苏联的图纸随便被修改了，苏联供应的极其贵重的工作母机被损坏了，质量不合格的新产品也出厂了。出厂的成品，用户说有问题，而他们则说：“用户不会使用新机器”。用这样的态度来试制新产品，怎能把工作做好呢？
    有些工厂的领导者，由于几年来试制和生产一些新产品，就以为“试制新产品，不过如此而已”。他们对于技术条件要求一步高于一步的新产品试制工作产生了一种盲目自负的情绪。他们对于极其艰苦和复杂的新产品试制工作抱着一种“轻敌”的态度。因而在工作顺利的时候，就沾沾自喜；当工作一碰上困难，就急躁起来。大连工矿车辆厂的领导工作人员，在试制五十吨敞车的时候，觉得更为复杂的特殊车辆都制造成功了，这还会有什么问题？可是，实际上这批任务拖期很久也没有完成。沈阳农业机械厂的领导工作人员，在开始试制苏式二十四行播种机的时候，也觉得比这更精密的产品也做过了，这是粗活，敲敲打打就成，不算什么。他们不按照试制顺序办事，一开始就小批生产，到了装配的时候，不得不全部返工，从去年到今年九月，始终没有完成国家试制新产品的任务。毫无疑问，我们试制新产品的成绩是显著的。旧中国从来没有想过的做过的机器，今天都在我们手里做出来了。过去一直依靠国外进口的机器，现在有的自己可以制造了，有的还可以出口。但是，在这方面我们的经验还是非常少的。随着我国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，机器制造工业的任务也愈来愈艰巨了，我们将在苏联的帮助下，全部学会制造世界上第一流的机器。我们只不过是万里长征中刚走完第一步，决不能一开始就沾上自满情绪，这会耽误我们伟大的事业的。
    还有些工厂的领导者没有信心，他们说：试制新产品的任务虽然很光荣；但是我们技术力量有限，还做不成。当然，应该承认目前我国的技术力量是薄弱的，是不足的；但是这决不是说我们只好坐下来等待，等到技术力量差不多的时候再动手。只有通过新产品的试制，才能不断壮大技术力量，更快地改变技术力量薄弱的状况。这里最需要认真地向苏联学习。事实证明，只要我们努力，只要我们认真地进行了学习，我们是可以赶得上的。沈阳第二机床厂就是这样。这个厂在试制新产品的问题上虽然跌过大斛斗，但是自去年秋季以来，他们把试制新产品的工作作为全厂一件大事，动员和教育全体职工虚心积极地学习苏联的先进经验，这样，情况就大为改变，最近有一种有四千个零件、每个零件从几道到几十道工序的异常复杂的苏式精密镗床，已经制造成功了。由此可见，技术力量不足固然是一个困难，但是只要我们老老实实地向苏联学习，困难还是可以克服的。
    造成新产品试制工作的困难原因当然是很多的，但是最主要的原因，还是某些工厂领导人员的思想没有迎头赶上国家工业化提出来的迫切的任务。为了加速国家工业化，为了使我国的机器制造工业能够适应国家工业化的需要，加强对试制新产品的思想领导，已经是一件刻不容缓的任务。
