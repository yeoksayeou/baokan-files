    American Hegemonic Interference in Japan's Internal Affairs
    Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, in response to questions from Diet members at the House of Representatives Budget Committee on December 10th, stated that the Japanese government would "bear no responsibility whatsoever for any agreements or contracts concluded by Japanese people's organizations and Chinese related parties," and that the Japanese government would continue to adhere to its policy of "non-recognition" of China. Shigemitsu also made some remarks unfavorable to improving Sino-Japanese relations when reporting on foreign policy at the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet on December 2nd.
    According to Japanese newspapers, Shigemitsu's recent repeated remarks unfavorable to Sino-Japanese relations were prompted by a memorandum presented to Shigemitsu by the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Allison, expressing the U.S. government's "strong dissatisfaction" with the practice of hundreds of Japanese civilian representatives visiting China and signing agreements, and demanding that the Japanese government express its attitude on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations. This instance once again illustrates the extent to which the United States has reached in rudely interfering in Japan's internal affairs. It not only exerts control over the Japanese government's military, economic, and diplomatic policies, but also openly interferes with the actions and behaviors of the Japanese people and civilian organizations. Japan is neither a state on the American continent nor an overseas colony of the United States. What right does the U.S. government have to interfere when the Japanese people are willing to visit their neighbors and are willing to interact with others on relevant matters?
    What is strange is the attitude of Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu. People remember that Shigemitsu once said to Japanese voters: "We are willing to adjust our relations with our continental neighbors," and later said that "the government intends to act in accordance with public opinion." However, the current reality is that Shigemitsu turns a deaf ear to the Japanese people's calls for the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, and declares "no responsibility whatsoever" for the efforts made by the Japanese people in this regard. On the contrary, he dutifully obeys a document from Washington interfering in Japan's internal affairs. One really doesn't know whether this Japanese Foreign Minister is responsible to the Japanese people or to the U.S. government?
    The friendly visits and agreements signed by representatives of Japanese people's organizations in China demonstrate that they are working hard, in accordance with the demands of the vast majority of the Japanese people, to promote the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan on the basis of peaceful coexistence, and to develop economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries. Anyone can see that these are entirely in line with the interests and aspirations of the people of both China and Japan. Over the past three or four years, Japanese people's organizations and Chinese related parties have signed agreements on trade, the return of Japanese nationals, fishery, cultural exchange, medicine, trade unions, and the promotion of the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. Through these agreements, China and Japan have conducted more than 50 million pounds of trade, and China has assisted nearly 30,000 Japanese nationals who wished to return to Japan. According to these agreements, various practical connections between China and Japan will undoubtedly be further developed. Anyone who is not opposed to Sino-Japanese friendship and hostile to peace in the Far East cannot deny that these agreements are beneficial to both China and Japan. The Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" also acknowledged that these agreements "are beneficial to Japan." The United States' dislike of these agreements is precisely because it wants to turn Japan into an "orphan of the Orient," into a base for atomic warfare, and into a dependent market for dumping American surplus agricultural products and surplus capital.
    We believe that the Japanese people and far-sighted Japanese politicians will not fail to see clearly the consequences of such blatant American interference in Japan's internal affairs. They will make greater efforts to break free from American control and force domestic American followers to change their policies that are detrimental to Japan. The desires and efforts of millions of Japanese people to be independent and autonomous, and to live in peace and friendly cooperation with their neighbors, cannot be stopped by Allison's "memorandum."

### 美国对日本内政的横蛮干涉

    美国对日本内政的横蛮干涉
    日本外务相重光葵十二月十日在众议院预算委员会答复议员质问时说，日本政府对于日本人民团体和中国有关方面“缔结的任何协定或合同一概不负责任”，日本政府将继续奉行“不承认”中国的政策。重光十二月二日在日本国会临时会议报告外交政策的时候，也说了一些不利于改进中日关系的话。
    重光最近一再发表这种不利于中日关系的言论，据日本报纸透露，是因为美国驻日大使艾利逊向重光提出了一个备忘录，表示美国政府对于数以百计的日本民间代表访问中国和签订协定的做法
  “非常不满”，要日本政府对中日关系问题表示态度。这一事例，又一次说明了美国粗暴地干涉日本的内政已达到了什么样的地步。它不但对日本政府的军事、经济和外交政策都横施控制，而且对日本人民和民间团体的举止行动也公然出来干涉了。日本既不是美国大陆上的一个州，又不是美国的海外殖民地。日本人民愿意访问他们的邻邦，愿意和别人就有关事务互相来往，美国政府有什么权利出来横加干涉呢？
    奇怪的是日本外务相重光的态度。人们记得，重光在日本选民面前曾说过：“我们愿意调整我们和我们大陆邻国之间的关系”，以后还说“政府打算按照舆论的意见办事”。但是，现在的事实是，重光对日本人民要求恢复中日两国正常关系的呼声充耳不闻，对日本人民为此而进行的努力表示“概不负责”。相反地，他对于来自华盛顿的干涉日本内政的一纸文书，倒是奉命唯谨。人们真不知道这位日本的外务相究竟是对日本人民负责呢，还是对美国政府负责？
    日本人民团体的代表在中国进行的友好访问和签订的协定，表现了他们是在根据日本广大人民的要求，努力促进中日两国在和平相处的基础上恢复正常关系，发展两国之间的经济、文化交流。谁也可以看出，这些都是完全符合中日两国人民的利益和愿望的。三四年来日本人民团体和中国有关方面签订了关于贸易、日侨回国、渔业、文化交流、医学、工会以及促进恢复中日两国邦交等各方面的协定。通过这些协定，中日两国进行了五千多万英磅的贸易，中国方面协助了愿意回国的近三万名日侨回到日本。根据这些协议，中日两国间的各种事务性的联系毫无疑问还将进一步发展起来。任何人如果不是反对中日友好和敌视远东和平，就不能否认这些协定对中日两国都是有利的。日本“每日新闻”也承认，这些协定“是对日本有利的”。美国表示不喜欢这些协定，正是因为它想把日本变成“东洋的孤儿”，变成原子战争基地，变成倾销美国剩余农产品和剩余资本的附属市场。
    我们相信，日本人民和日本有远见的政治家，对于美国这样露骨干涉日本内政的后果是不会看不清楚的。他们将以更大的努力来争取摆脱美国的控制，并且迫使国内的美国追随者改变其不利于日本的政策。千百万日本人民要求独立自主，要求同邻国和平相处、友好合作的愿望和努力，是艾利逊的
  “备忘录”所阻挡不了的。
