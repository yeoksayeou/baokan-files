Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 3rd. Currently, there are more than 47,900 agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province, with farmer households joining the cooperatives reaching 65% of the province's total number of farmer households. Because some counties and townships originally set development plans too low and exercised overly strict control over the development plans, the Communist Party organizations at all levels in Shanxi Province have recently revised their plans for developing cooperatives this year. According to the revised plan, by the end of this year, the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives will account for 75% to 77% of the total number of farmer households. At that time, the province will basically complete the semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization.

The county committees of the Communist Party in more than ten counties, including Fushan, Taigu, and Yuci, held enlarged county committee meetings or enlarged cadre meetings at the county, district, and township levels in late November, respectively, to continue to examine and criticize right-leaning conservative thinking in the agricultural cooperativization movement. They also raised the development plans for cooperatives, which had been set too low, by 10% to 20%. Fanshi County, which had already completed its original cooperative establishment plan, decided, based on the uneven development of the cooperative movement throughout the county, to concentrate its efforts on rectification and consolidation in areas that had already completed this year's plan for developing new cooperatives and expanding old ones. In a few townships where the movement was progressing slowly, they were required to strengthen ideological education for farmers who wanted to join the cooperatives in conjunction with rectifying existing cooperatives, strive to complete the cooperative establishment plan, and correct the phenomenon of restricting poor farmers from joining the cooperatives. The Communist Party Committee of Kelan County has sent cadres to backward districts and townships to strengthen the work of establishing cooperatives.

    山西省今年年底可基本完成农业合作化
    据新华社太原三日电　目前，山西省农业生产合作社已经发展到四万七千九百多个，入社农户达到全省农户总数的百分之六十五。由于有些县、乡原订的发展计划偏低，对发展计划控制过严，因此，中共山西省各级组织最近重新修订了今年发展社的计划。按照修订后的计划，到今年年底全省入社农户将占到农户总数百分之七十五到七十七，那时，全省将基本上完成半社会主义的农业合作化。
    浮山、太谷、榆次等十多个县的中共县委员会，在十一月底分别召开县委扩大会议或县、区、乡三级扩大干部会议，继续检查和批判了农业合作化运动中的右倾保守思想，并且把订得过低的发展社的计划，提高了百分之十到二十。已经完成原订建社计划的繁峙县，依照全县合作化运动发展不平衡情况，决定在已经完成今年发展新社、扩大老社计划的地区，集中力量进行整顿巩固；在少数运动进展缓慢的乡要求结合整顿现有社，对要求入社农民加强思想教育，争取完成建社计划，并且纠正限制贫农入社的现象。中共岢岚县委员会已派出干部到落后的区、乡加强建社工作。
