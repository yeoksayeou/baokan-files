    Beijing's Experience in Transforming Private Industry and Future Plans
    By Jia Tingsan, Vice Mayor of Beijing

    In 1949, Beijing had 4,150 capitalist industrial enterprises, of which only five had more than 100 employees. By the end of 1954, this had grown to 5,960 enterprises, with 90 having more than 100 employees. In 1954, the total capital of all capitalist industrial enterprises was about 25 million yuan, with an annual output value of 330 million yuan. The technical equipment of these private industrial enterprises was very backward. For example, four machine dyeing factories had eight boilers, but five of them could not be used due to the risk of explosion. The weaving machines were called "teaching son" looms. Most of the machines in the iron industry were old and unusable. Many factories rented their premises, some were wooden or straw sheds, or buildings past their insurance period. The blind development of certain industries also brought many difficulties. On the other hand, most of these enterprises' products met the needs of the country and the urban and rural people. Therefore, we need to adopt various transitional forms to carry out the socialist transformation of these enterprises.

    In the past, our socialist transformation of capitalist industry involved, firstly, using processing orders, purchase and sales, and price policies to urge private factories to merge and combine. Through processing orders, we understood their production situation, prompted them to improve equipment, improve quality, and reduce costs. In September 1955, the output value of processing orders and other activities already accounted for 82 percent of the total output value of capitalist industry. Another method was for the state to control the main production links that private factories could not solve, transforming private factories into processing plants that manufactured parts, components, and semi-finished products for state-owned factories. For example, in the knitting industry, by controlling processes such as mercerization, dyeing, and cold pumps, we transformed the entire knitting industry into a processing factory producing semi-finished products for dyeing and finishing companies, improving product quality and reducing costs. At the same time, we also focused on piloting public-private joint ventures. In 1953, there were nine public-private joint venture factories, and in 1954, another twenty were established, with a total output value accounting for 13 percent of the total output value of capitalist industry. Due to the encouragement of capitalists to merge and combine factories in recent years, and the accumulation of some experience in public-private joint ventures, in 1955 we adopted the form of industry-wide joint ventures to transform capitalist industry. Throughout the year, nine industries, including knitting, flour, and electrical machinery, with 126 enterprises, will implement industry-wide public-private joint ventures. The number of public-private joint venture factories can reach more than 150, accounting for 9 percent of the total number of private industrial enterprises with more than ten employees, 17 percent of the employees, and the output value can reach 41 percent.

    In the process of implementing industry-wide public-private joint ventures, we also carried out the adjustment and reorganization of enterprises. The methods were roughly as follows:

    The first method is to merge factories. This can concentrate the use of equipment, increase productivity, improve product quality, and reduce costs. Merging many small factories into large factories also makes it easier to lead and manage after the implementation of public-private joint ventures. For example, the flour industry did not have enough production tasks, and some factories had very backward technical equipment and high costs. After the joint venture, unified management allowed four factories with better technical equipment, higher flour yield, and lower costs to concentrate on production. The remaining six factories with backward technical equipment or no current tasks were shut down to organize employee training. It is estimated that this will reduce costs by 10 percent in the fourth quarter of this year. Before the joint venture, it was expected that there would be a loss of more than 1,600 yuan this year. After this reorganization, it is estimated that there will be a surplus of 30,000 yuan next year, and the flour yield can be increased to increase flour production for the state.

    The second method is to transform private factories into processing plants that manufacture parts, components, and semi-finished products for state-owned factories. For example, since 1951, we have been organizing processing and collaboration in the knitting industry with more than 770 households through public-private joint venture dyeing and finishing companies, starting from mastering production, supply, sales, and product quality specifications. The dyeing and finishing company added some major production equipment, solving the problem of finishing technical equipment such as mercerization, dyeing, steaming, and cold pumps that private small businesses could not handle in the past. The private small businesses then received cotton yarn from the dyeing and finishing company to weave into sock tubes, which were then finished into finished products by state-owned factories. This improved quality, guaranteed specifications, reduced costs, and opened up sales channels.

    The third method is to implement specialized division of labor. For example, the electrical machinery manufacturing industry was very small in scale, with very backward equipment, doing everything, unable to guarantee quality, and with very high costs. This time, the Beijing Electrical Machinery Company was established to be responsible for the joint venture and reorganization of the industry in a unified manner. Based on the characteristics of the industry, the nature of the products, future needs and development, and its own technical equipment, the method of "large leading small, advanced leading backward" was adopted to merge fifteen factories into six factories, implementing specialized division of labor, respectively producing small switches, transformers, distribution panels, electrical instruments, and heating and ventilation equipment. This can change the past situation of small jobs not being able to get enough to eat and big jobs not being able to handle.

    The fourth method is to become affiliated branch factories of local state-owned factories. For example, nine chemical and pharmaceutical factories were merged into two factories, under the leadership of the local state-owned Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory, with a division of labor to produce fixed products, effectively becoming affiliated workshops of the factory.

    Based on past experience, when carrying out adjustments and reorganizations by industry in the future, we should, as far as possible, carry out specialized division of labor according to product types. Although Beijing's private industry is scattered and backward, it has a large variety of products and specifications, and most of them can meet the diverse needs of the country and the people. In the reorganization, it is necessary to take into account this characteristic for division of labor, and we should not only reduce the variety and specifications for the sake of convenient management and pursuit of mass production, or change everything to produce "mass goods," but also actively increase new varieties and specifications to better meet the diverse needs of the country and the people. In particular, some advanced manual skills and industries that are not easily replaced should be preserved and should not be rudely changed or canceled.

    Adopting the method of fixed interest for dividends for capitalists will create favorable conditions for carrying out industry-wide public-private joint ventures and adjustments and reorganizations. Capitalist industrial enterprises in Beijing generally have little capital and small dividends. In this situation, the main income of capitalists does not come from dividends, but from the wages of participating in work. Therefore, properly arranging the work of capitalists is an important task. We should make arrangements based on the principle of using talents according to their abilities, so that capitalists can be placed in suitable positions and facilitate their self-transformation.

    The Municipal Party Committee once proposed that, because Beijing's private industry is very scattered and backward, it must take local state-owned industry as the center, organize private industry around itself according to the principles of specialized division of labor and production collaboration, so that it can produce various parts for state-owned industry, or undertake the processing of certain processes, or be fixed to undertake machine repair, becoming affiliated workshops of local state-owned factories, and carry out led joint ventures, mergers, and reorganizations in this process to prepare conditions for large-scale public-private joint ventures. However, our efforts in this area have not been enough, and we have not summarized and promoted the existing experience in a timely manner. At the same time, the targets for public-private joint ventures in private industry in the five-year plan proposed in the past were also too low. After recent research, we are considering the principles and steps for the plan to develop public-private joint ventures in capitalist industry with more than ten employees: First, industries where all or most of the processing orders are carried out by the state should be merged first, because the products and raw materials of these industries are controlled by the state, and only the intermediate production process is operated by capitalists, and it is more beneficial to merge sooner rather than later. Industries such as flour, chemical pharmaceuticals, oil pressing, knitting, dyeing and weaving, papermaking, and electrical machinery have already been merged, and industries such as weaving can also be merged next year. Second, for industries with serious production difficulties and many households, such as wood products, small hardware for construction, and the iron industry, specialized companies should first arrange production, carry out joint ventures in the arrangement of production, or transform them in processing orders in a planned manner, or eliminate them in a planned manner. Third, industries where the state controls part of the raw materials and part of the products, such as cultural and educational supplies, building materials, auto parts, printing, and chemical industry, can also be merged, but because our strength is temporarily insufficient, we plan to put them in the second batch of joint ventures. Fourth, industries where most of the products are self-produced and self-sold and are not closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood, such as ceramics, glass, shoes, and hats, will be merged last. Fifth, industries that mainly serve the public, are highly speculative, and the state has the full power to replace them, with more harm than good, will be directly operated entirely by the state, absorbing their workers, without going through public-private joint ventures. Sixth, for a small number of manual industries with very difficult production, supply, and sales, backward production, and are not currently needed and will be completely replaced by machine production, modern industry needs to absorb workers and eliminate them in a planned manner.

    Based on the above principles, our preliminary plan for the transformation of private industrial enterprises with more than ten employees is: In addition to the 29 households that have been merged before 1954, accounting for 13 percent of the total output value, in 1955, 126 public-private joint venture industrial enterprises will produce 62.18 million yuan, accounting for 28 percent of the total output value, totaling 41 percent. According to the current enthusiastic application of industrial enterprises, it is possible to basically complete the industry-wide realization of public-private joint ventures in 1956. And it is also possible to complete this plan ahead of schedule.

    Small industrial enterprises with four to nine employees have a large number of households, most of which still have big shopkeepers, second shopkeepers, and even third shopkeepers. If joint ventures are implemented, it will be difficult to place personnel and manage them. At the same time, although the owners of these households all have exploitation, most of them were originally skilled workers and are now also participating in labor, and some mainly rely on labor for food. Therefore, we believe that the vast majority can take the road of collectivization.

    The city has a total of 120,000 handicraft practitioners. By the end of 1954, a total of more than 27,000 people had been organized. Due to the rapid development, there was no systematic consolidation, capitalist management thinking was very serious, and the composition was very complex. This year, we concentrated our efforts on consolidation for more than half a year. Therefore, only more than 8,000 people have been developed this year, with a cumulative total of 35,000 people by the end of the year. After this consolidation, according to the current situation that individual handicraftsmen in Beijing are actively requesting to be organized, it can reach about 80 percent next year. In order to adapt to the transformation of capitalist industry, it is planned to basically organize handicrafts in 1957. Regarding the transformation of the repair industry, we realize that scattered repair industries should not be organized for centralized production. The locality of this type of industry is very large. In order to better serve residents, it is appropriate to organize cooperatives by region. For example, we once organized individual handicraftsmen who repaired cage drawers to establish a cage drawer production cooperative, centralized production, resulting in the new cage drawers being unsalable, and residents could not find anyone to repair the cage drawers. Because cage drawers are something that residents need every day, it is only suitable for residents to repair them on the spot at any time between two meals. Therefore, these service industries should be planned on a district basis and balanced throughout the city. These households should first be organized from the raw material supply link, and they can also be subjected to socialist transformation.

    北京市改造私营工业的经验和今后规划   
    北京市副市长  贾庭三
    一九四九年，北京市共有资本主义工业四千一百五十户，其中具有一百个职工以上的工厂只有五户。到一九五四年底，发展到了五千九百六十户，其中具有一百个职工以上的有九十户。一九五四年，全部资本主义工业的资本共有二千五百万元左右，全年产值有三亿三千万元。这些私营工业企业的技术设备是十分落后的。如机器染布业四户共有八个锅炉，就有五个锅炉因为有爆炸危险不能使用。织布业的机器被人叫做“三娘教子”用的织布机。铁工业中的机器多数已经破旧不能使用。许多工厂的厂房有不少是租来的，有些还是木棚、席棚，或者是过了保险期的建筑。某些行业盲目发展的结果，也带来了很多困难。但是在另一方面，这些企业的产品绝大多数都是适合国家和城乡人民的需要的。因此，我们需要采取各种各样的过渡形式来对这些企业进行社会主义改造。
    我们过去对资本主义工业进行社会主义改造，第一步是通过加工订货、收购包销和价格政策，督促私营工厂联营并厂，在加工订货中了解它们的生产情况，促使它们改善设备，提高质量，降低成本。一九五五年九月份加工订货等产值已经占资本主义工业总产值的百分之八十二。另一种办法是由国家掌握私营工厂所不能解决的主要生产环节，使私营工厂变成为国营工厂制造部件、零件、半成品的加工厂。如针织业，由于我们掌握了丝光、染色、冷泵等工序，使整个针织业成为给染整公司生产半成品的加工工厂，提高了产品质量，降低了成本。同时，我们还重点试办了公私合营。一九五三年共有公私合营工厂九户，一九五四年又合营了二十户，合计产值共占资本主义工业总产值的百分之十三。由于几年来促使资本家合营并厂，同时积累了一些公私合营的经验，一九五五年已经采取按行业合营的形式对资本主义工业进行改造，全年将有针织、面粉、电机等九个行业一百二十六户实行全行业公私合营，公私合营工厂户数可以达到一百五十多户，占具有十个职工以上的私营工业总户数的百分之九，职工占百分之十七，产值可以达到百分之四十一。
    我们在按行业进行公私合营中，同时进行了企业的调整和改组。其方法大体有以下几种：
    第一种办法是并厂。这样做可以集中使用设备，提高生产率，提高产品质量，降低成本。把很多小厂并为大厂，在实行公私合营后，也容易领导和管理。如面粉业生产任务不足，有些厂技术设备很落后，成本很高。合营后统一管理，使四个原来技术设备较好，出粉率较高，成本较低的工厂集中生产，其余六个技术设备落后或目前没有任务的工厂，停车组织职工学习，这样今年第四季度预计可降低成本百分之十。合营前预计今年要赔一千六百多元，这样改组后，估计明年可盈余三万元，还可以提高出粉率为国家增产面粉。
    第二种办法是把私营工厂改为替国营工厂制造部件、零件、半成品的加工工厂。例如，我们从一九五一年起就通过公私合营染整公司对针织业七百七十多户，从掌握产供销和产品质量规格入手，组织加工协作，由染整公司添置一些主要生产设备，解决了私营小户过去无法处理的丝光、染色、汽汀、冷泵等整理技术设备问题。私营小户则从染整公司领取棉纱织成袜筒，经国营工厂最后加工制成成品，这样就提高了质量，保证了规格，降低了成本，打开了销路。
    第三种办法是实行专业分工。如电机制造业，规模很小，设备很落后，什么活都做，不能保证质量，成本很高。这次成立了北京市电机公司，统一负责进行该行业的合营和改组工作，根据该业的特点，产品的性质，今后的需要和发展，本身的技术设备等情况，采取“以大带小，以先进带落后”的方法，把十五个厂合并为六个厂，实行专业分工，分别生产小型开关、变电器、配电盘、电气仪表、冷热通风设备等。这样就可以改变过去小活吃不饱、大活吃不了的情况。
    第四种办法是作为地方国营工厂的附属分厂。如化学制药业九个厂合并为两个厂，归地方国营北京制药厂领导，分工生产固定产品，实际上已经成为该厂的附属车间。
    根据过去的经验，今后按行业进行调整、改组时，应该尽可能按产品种类进行专业分工。北京市私营工业虽然分散落后，但是产品品种、规格较多，大部分能够适应国家、人民多种多样的需要。在改组中需要照顾到这一特点进行分工，不仅不应该只是为了管理方便，追求大量生产而减少品种和规格，或都改成生产“大路货”，而且还应该积极增加新的品种、规格，以便更好地满足国家、人民的多种多样的需要。特别是对一些高级手工技艺，一时不易被代替的行业，应该保留下来，不应该粗暴地加以改变或取消。
    对资本家的分红采取定息的办法，将为按行业进行公私合营和调整、改组创造有利的条件。北京市资本主义工业企业一般资金少、分红也少。在这种情况下，资本家主要的收入不是靠分红，而是靠参加工作的工资。因此，妥善安排资本家的工作是一项重要的工作。我们应当根据量才使用的原则进行安排，使资本家各得其所并便于他们进行自我改造。
    市委曾经提出：由于北京私营工业十分分散和落后，必须以地方国营工业为中心，按照专业分工和生产协作的原则，把私营工业组织在自己周围，使它为国营工业生产各种配件，或担负某些工序的加工，或固定担负机器修理，成为地方国营工厂的附属车间，并且在这个过程中进行有领导的联营、并厂和改组，为大规模的公私合营准备条件。但是我们在这方面的努力不够，对于已有的经验，也没有及时总结和推广。同时过去提出的五年计划中对于私营工业的公私合营的指标也偏低。经过最近研究后，我们考虑对具有十个职工以上的资本主义工业发展公私合营的规划的原则和步骤是：第一，对全部或绝大部分由国家进行加工订货的行业，首先进行合营，因为这些行业的产品和原料都由国家掌握，只是中间生产过程由资本家经营，早合营比晚合营更为有利。这些行业中的面粉、化学制药、榨油、针织、染布、造纸、电机等行业，已经合营，还有织布等行业明年也可以合营。第二，对生产有严重困难、户数又多的行业，如木器、建筑用小五金、铁工业等，由专业公司先安排生产，在安排生产中进行合营，或者有计划地在加工订货中进行改造，或者有计划地淘汰。第三，部分原料和部分产品由国家控制的行业，如文教用品、建筑材料、汽车配件、印刷、化工等本来也可以合营，但是因为我们的力量暂时还不够，准备放到第二批合营。第四，对大部分产品自产自销的和国计民生关系不很大的行业，如陶磁、玻璃、鞋帽等，则放到最后合营。第五，对一些主要是为公家服务、投机性很大、国家又完全有力量代替的害多利少的行业，则直接完全由国家经营，吸收其工人，不经过公私合营。第六，对少数产供销十分困难，生产落后，目前不大需要，已经开始并且将要全部被机器生产所代替的手工行业，则需要由现代工业吸收工人，并且有步骤地予以淘汰。
    根据以上原则，我们对具有十个职工以上私营工业的改造的初步规划是：除一九五四年以前已合营二十九户，占总产值百分之十三以外，一九五五年公私合营工业一百二十六户，产值六千二百一十八万元，占总产值百分之二十八，累计为百分之四十一。其余根据目前工业积极申请的情况，可以在一九五六年基本上完成按行业实现公私合营。并且还有可能提前完成这个计划。
    具有四至九个职工的小型工业，户数很多，大都还有大掌柜、二掌柜，甚至三掌柜，如果实行合营，人员不好安置，也不好管理。同时，这些户的业主，虽然都有剥削，但是大都原来是技术工人出身，现在也参加劳动，有些还主要靠劳动吃饭。因此，我们认为绝大多数都可以走合作化的道路。
    全市手工业从业人员共计十二万人，至一九五四年底，共组织起来二万七千多人，由于发展很快，没有系统进行整顿，资本主义经营思想很严重，成分也很复杂，今年用了半年多的时间集中力量进行了整顿，因此今年只发展了八千多人，到年底累计三万五千人。这样整顿以后，根据目前北京市个体手工业积极要求组织起来的情况明年可以达到百分之八十左右。为了同资本主义工业改造相适应，计划一九五七年把手工业基本上都组织起来。关于修理业的改造问题，我们体会到，零散的修理业不宜组织集中生产，这类行业的地区性很大，为了更好地为居民服务，以按地区组织合作社为宜。如我们曾组织修理笼屉的个体手工业者成立了一个笼屉生产合作社，集中生产，结果生产的新笼屉滞销，居民要修理也找不到修笼屉的，因为笼屉是居民每天需要的东西，只有在居民门口两顿饭之间随时就地修理才适合居民的需要。因此这些服务性的行业应当以区为单位进行规划，全市平衡。对于这些户先由原料供应环节上组织起来，也可以对他们进行社会主义改造。
