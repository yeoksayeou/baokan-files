To the Editor:

The accumulation of raw materials and waste at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant is very serious. From January to April, the plant planned to use 86 tons of non-ferrous metals, but actually only used 35 tons, resulting in an accumulation of materials worth more than 210,000 yuan. The plan was to use 940 tons of cement, but only 129 tons were actually used. The plan was to use 2,792 sets of ball bearings, but only 483 sets were actually used. The plant's ball bearings are piled up like mountains, and the warehouse management staff complained, "We might as well build another ball bearing warehouse."

The waste is even greater due to the fact that some of the factory's repaired and newly built projects cannot be used. For example, the coking department spent more than 56,000 yuan to build a peat ditch, but it turned out to be unusable. Last year, the transportation department spent more than 39,000 yuan to build a new water slag railway, but after it was completed, it was discovered that the slope was too steep, and it was all torn down.

The main reasons for these serious problems are that the relevant leaders lack the concept of careful calculation and rational use of funds, and the planning staff's "generous estimation and tight use" mentality and irresponsible work style are also very serious. The workers are very dissatisfied with these wasteful phenomena and have repeatedly raised opinions. The plant's supervision office also submitted an inspection plan to the plant director in July regarding opposing waste, but it did not receive due attention. As a result, the problem became even more serious in the third quarter. From January to August, the circulating funds occupied by stockpiled materials exceeded the state plan by 4.23 percent, which extended the turnover rate of circulating funds by 13 days, and the profit remitted was 5.8 percent in arrears.

I request that the leaders of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant quickly change their irresponsible and erroneous attitude, conduct a thorough inspection, and overcome this serious waste phenomenon.

### 太原钢铁厂积压浪费材料的现象很严重

    太原钢铁厂积压浪费材料的现象很严重编辑同志：
    太原钢铁厂原材料的积压现象十分严重。从一月到四月份，全厂计划用有色金属八十六吨，实际上只用了三十五吨，这一项积压物资的价值就达到二十一万多元；计划用水泥九百四十吨，实际上只用一百二十九吨；计划用滚珠二千七百九十二盘，实际上只用了四百八十三盘。厂里滚珠堆积如山，仓库管理人员很不满意地说：“干脆再盖个滚珠库吧。”
    这个厂修复和新建了一些工程不能用，浪费更大。例如，炼焦部花了五万六千多元修了个泥煤沟，结果不能用。运输部去年用三万九千多元新建水渣铁路一条，修成以后发现坡度太大，又全部拆掉。
    产生这些严重问题的原因，主要是有关领导人员，缺乏精打细算、合理使用资金的观点，计划人员“宽打窄用”思想和不负责任的作风也很严重。职工群众对这些浪费现象非常不满意，多次提出意见，厂监察室七月份也向厂长提出关于反对浪费的检查计划，但是都没有引起应有的重视。因此，第三季度问题就更加严重。从一月到八月，积压材料占用的流动资金超过了国家计划的百分之四点二三，使流动资金周转率延长了十三天，上缴利润欠缴百分之五点八。
    我要求太原钢铁厂的领导人员迅速改变不负责任的错误态度，切实进行检查，克服这种严重的浪费现象。李永吉
