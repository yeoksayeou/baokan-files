    Handling Land Entering Cooperatives According to the Principle of Mutual Benefit
    He Cheng
    One of the most significant features of agricultural production cooperatives is the unified use of members' land by the entire cooperative. One of the most important reasons why agricultural production cooperatives can increase production is that they combine scattered land for unified use, enabling rational and planned management.
    In the past, farmers regarded land as their "lifeline." Before the land reform, many farmers had to endure the cruel exploitation of landlords and rich peasants because they had no land or lacked land. After the land reform, farmers all had land; however, because they still operated independently, they could not manage rationally and in a planned way, and they could not increase production substantially. If they suffered a little disaster or encountered some other difficulties, some people still had to sell their land to others. It is very difficult for farmers to maintain their land in the long term by relying on their own individual efforts; even if they can maintain it for a period of time, it is difficult to live a good life. If we want to prevent the land from falling into the hands of the exploiting class again, and if we want everyone to live a prosperous life, there is only one best way: to form cooperatives and use the land of the members together. Use collective strength to overcome various difficulties and defeat the exploiting classes. It is difficult for individual households to keep the "lifeline" of land; putting the "lifeline" together and uniting to protect it and irrigate it will keep it most securely, and a perennial evergreen tree will grow on this "root," bearing more and more beautiful fruits year after year.
    Members' Land Must Be Used Uniformly
    The Draft Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives stipulates: "Members' land must be handed over to the agricultural production cooperative for unified use."
    In the past, some people who were not firm enough in joining the cooperative adopted the practice of joining with half of their land and keeping half of their land, and some even secretly rented land outside the cooperative for private cultivation. Everyone called these people "members with one foot in the door and one foot out." Not going in and not coming out, as a result, not only could they not take care of both ends, reducing their own income, but also greatly affecting the production of the cooperative, making it impossible to consolidate the cooperative. People who do this are obviously not truly voluntarily joining the cooperative; they should better think through the matter and become members who have fully walked into the door. If they really can't figure it out, they can temporarily not participate in the cooperative.
    Is it true that once the land is handed over to the cooperative for unified use, can't any of it be retained at all? What if you want to grow some vegetables for yourself? Many women are willing to join the cooperative, but they worry that they won't even be able to grow some green vegetables, eggplants, peppers, and pumpkins, which would be too inconvenient. The draft model regulations have already taken this into account: "In order to take care of the needs of members to grow vegetables or other horticultural crops, members should be allowed to have small plots of private land." How much private land is appropriate to retain? The draft model regulations also stipulate: The size of the private land per household should be determined according to the size of the household population and the amount of land in the local area. However, the land retained per person should not exceed 5% of the average amount of land owned per person in the whole village.
    Members Can Receive Land Compensation
    According to the provisions of the draft model regulations, in the elementary agricultural production cooperative, members must also receive appropriate compensation based on the amount and quality of land handed over to the cooperative for unified use. Why is land compensation still given? This is mainly to take care of the private ownership concept of land that ordinary farmers have formed over thousands of years. The amount and quality of land owned by members are different; if there is no land compensation, people with more and better land will feel that they are at a disadvantage and will not be willing to join the cooperative.
    Everyone knows that land compensation is calculated based on yield. Only when the yield is assessed reasonably can the land compensation be reasonable. According to what standard is the yield of the land assessed? Everyone is very concerned about this issue, and there have been many disputes over it in the past. The draft model regulations have the following provisions on this issue: The yield of the land entering the cooperative should be assessed on the one hand based on the original quality of the land, and on the other hand based on the actual yield of the land. This is the fairest way to do this, which can both take into account the situation that the land of many poor members did not originally reach the proper yield (the yield will increase after joining the cooperative), and also enable members who improved the quality of the land before joining the cooperative to receive the compensation they deserve.
    At present, there are two main methods used by agricultural production cooperatives in various places to stipulate land compensation: one is to agree on a fixed land compensation, which is often called the "fixed rent system"; the other is to deduct the production costs, public accumulation fund, and public welfare fund of the year from the total agricultural income of each year, and then separate the land compensation and labor compensation according to a certain percentage, which is often called the "flexible rent system." In addition, there is a transitional method: the fixed output part is based on the composition, and the increased output is all attributed to labor. According to the experience of various places, the method of fixing the amount of land compensation is more conducive to giving play to the enthusiasm of members' labor. The draft model regulations stipulate: Land compensation should generally be agreed upon by the cooperative at a fixed amount, and should not increase with the development of the cooperative's production, so that the benefits of the development of the cooperative's production can be fully used in labor compensation and public property accumulation. This means that land compensation should not "rise with the tide," rising with the development of production. Only when the cooperative is first established, especially in areas that are often hit by natural disasters and where land yields are relatively unstable, and there is no certainty in agreeing on a fixed amount of land compensation, can the "flexible rent system" or other transitional methods be temporarily adopted. Now that the land is used uniformly, who should pay the agricultural tax? According to the provisions of the draft model regulations, since members still have land compensation, the agricultural tax should be borne by each household of members. If the agricultural tax is borne by the cooperative, that is also possible; however, the land compensation of the members should be reduced.
    Land Compensation Should Be Lower Than Labor Compensation
    The land compensation of the cooperative should not be too much. The draft model regulations clearly stipulate: "Land compensation must be lower than agricultural labor compensation." Because, only in this way can the enthusiasm of members to participate in collective labor be encouraged. This point must not be taken lightly. If the land compensation is too high, it will cause the few people with land and strong labor to be exploited in disguise by the many people with land and little labor. Such a cooperative is not a collective economic organization of the working people, but can only be said to be a false cooperative controlled by exploiting elements. In such a cooperative, farmers with more labor and less land feel that they are "working as hired laborers for households with more land," and their enthusiasm for labor will certainly not be high, and it will be difficult to increase production. In the past, the distribution ratio of land and labor often became the most disputed issue in the cooperative. Farmers with more land always emphasized that "crops cannot grow without land, and land should be distributed more." In fact, this is sophistry. No one can deny that all income is created by labor; land, however, is not created by anyone, but has existed since the beginning of the world. It is inherently unreasonable that whoever occupies more land can get more things created by labor. In the initial stage of the cooperative, it is already taking care of those who occupy more land by giving land compensation. If you still feel that the "care" is not enough and want it to be higher than labor compensation, then it is even more unreasonable. Of course, when the cooperative has just been established, the land compensation should not be too little. There are some farming households in various places with very little land and a severe shortage of labor. If the land compensation is set too low all at once, they will have difficulties, and this should also be paid attention to.
    In places where land is particularly scarce and the population is particularly large, people attach particular importance to land. According to the draft model regulations, in this situation, land compensation can also temporarily be equivalent to labor compensation. However, to do so, it must be approved by the provincial people's committee; and it should be noted that it can only be temporarily equivalent to labor compensation, not for a long time, and not higher than labor compensation. In the opposite situation, in places where there is a particularly large amount of land and a particularly small population, such as many places in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, even when the cooperative is first established, the compensation for land can be set lower or no land compensation can be given according to local customs. Because, as long as conditions permit, reducing or eliminating land compensation and increasing labor compensation or completely paying according to labor can greatly encourage labor enthusiasm and develop collective production. It should be believed that full socialism is definitely stronger than semi-socialism.
    Land Compensation Will Be Abolished in the Future
    Everyone knows that running cooperatives is taking the socialist road. One of the most important principles of socialism is to pay according to labor, which is the fairest and most reasonable distribution principle. As mentioned earlier, land receiving compensation is to take care of the private ownership concept of land, which is not entirely in line with the principle of paying according to labor. The cooperative should gradually increase labor compensation with the development of production and the improvement of members' awareness, and transition to the advanced agricultural production cooperative that completely "pays according to labor." Article 3 of Chapter 1 of the draft model regulations stipulates: "With the development of production and the improvement of members' socialist awareness, the cooperative will gradually abolish compensation for members' land." Actively increasing production, improving socialist awareness, creating conditions, and striving to transition to advanced cooperatives are the goals we should all strive for. At present, many well-run old cooperatives have been transformed into advanced cooperatives, and many other old cooperatives are also actively preparing for transformation; this is the road that agricultural production cooperatives across the country must take. Some people ask: What about those old, weak, orphaned, and widowed households after the land compensation is abolished? There is no need to worry about this. With the development of the cooperative's production, the compensation for their participation in light labor has also increased. Moreover, the public welfare fund accumulated by the cooperative will give them more and more help. Their income will not be reduced as a result.
    There are also many practical issues closely related to land. For example: How to deal with land with green seedlings? How to handle water conservancy projects such as ponds, wells, canals, and dams on the land? How to deal with special land such as members' privately owned wasteland, cultivated land, fish ponds, lotus ponds, and reed marshes? etc. In the draft model regulations, reasonable and correct solutions have been formulated for these issues. The interests of all types of members are taken into account, and it is also in line with the interests of the entire cooperative. In short, the labor and investment spent by members before joining the cooperative will certainly not be wasted as long as it is used in the proper place. The cooperative will definitely take care of the interests that members should receive. Of course, in dealing with these issues, the interests of the entire cooperative must not be harmed. Following the provisions of the draft model regulations will surely satisfy everyone and run the cooperative well.

    按照互利原则处理入社的土地
    何成
    农业生产合作社的一个最显著的特点就是全社统一使用社员的土地。农业生产合作社能够增加生产，最重要的原因之一，就是把分散的土地联合起来统一使用，能够合理地有计划地经营。
    过去农民都把土地当做“命根子”。在土地改革以前，多少农民因为没有土地或者缺少土地，不得不受地主富农的残酷剥削。在土地改革以后，农民都有了土地；可是，因为仍然是各家经营各家的，不能合理地有计划地经营，不能大量增产；受了一点灾害，或者碰到一些别的困难，有些人仍然不得不把自己的地卖给别人。农民要想靠各家各户自己的力量把土地长期保持下去，是很困难的；就算能够保持一个时期，也很难把日子过好。要使土地不再落到剥削阶级的手里，要想大家都过富裕的生活，只有一个最好的办法，就是成立合作社，把社员各家的地伙到一起来用。用集体的力量战胜各种困难，战胜剥削阶级。单门独户想保住土地这个“命根子”很难；把“命根子”放在一起，大家团结起来保卫它、灌溉它，就能最牢靠地保住它，并且在这“根子”上长出万年长青的大树来，一年比一年结更多更美的果子。
    社员的土地要统一使用
    农业生产合作社示范章程草案上规定：“社员的土地必须交给农业生产合作社统一使用。”
    过去，有些入社不够坚决的人，采取了入一半土地留一半土地的做法，有的还偷偷地在社外私自租种了土地。大家把这种人叫做“一脚门里、一脚门外的社员”。不进门去，也不出来，结果，不仅两头顾不来，自己减少了收入，还大大影响了合作社的生产，使合作社不能巩固。这样做的人，显然不是真正自愿入社的；他们最好是把道理想通，变成完全走进门来的社员。要是真正想不通，也可以暂时不参加合作社。
    土地交给社里统一使用，是不是一点也不能留呢？自己想种点菜吃怎么办？有许多妇女虽然也愿意入社，可是就担心自己连点青菜、茄子、辣椒、南瓜都不能种了，太不方便。示范章程草案上已经照顾到了这一点：“为了照顾社员种植蔬菜或者别的园艺作物的需要，应该允许社员有小块的自留地。”自留地究竟留多少合适呢？示范章程草案上也规定好了：社员每户自留地的大小，应该按照每户人口的多少和当地土地的多少来决定。但是，每口人所留的土地至多不能超过全村每口人所有土地的平均数的百分之五。
    社员可以得到土地报酬
    按照示范章程草案的规定，在初级农业生产合作社里，社员还要按交给社里统一使用的土地的多少和好坏，得到适当的报酬。为什么还要给土地报酬呢？这主要是照顾一般农民对土地的千百年来造成的私有观念。社员的土地多少好坏是不相同的；如果土地没有报酬，地多地好的人就会觉得吃亏，就不愿意入社了。
    大家都知道，土地报酬是按产量计算的。产量评定得合理，土地报酬才能合理。按什么标准评定土地的产量？大家对这个问题也十分关心，过去为这发生的争论也挺多。示范章程草案对这个问题有这样的规定：评定入社土地的产量，一方面要根据土地原有的质量，另一方面要根据土地的实际产量。这样做最公平，既能照顾到许多贫苦社员的土地原来达不到应有产量（入社后产量就能提高）的情形，也能使入社以前改善了土地质量的社员得到应得的报酬。
    目前，各地的农业生产合作社规定土地报酬的办法，主要的有两种：一种是议定固定的土地报酬，就是常说的“死租制”；另一种是从每年的农业总收入中扣除当年的生产费、公积金和公益金以后，把土地报酬和劳动报酬按一定的成数分开，就是常说的“活租制”。另外，还有一种过渡办法：定产部分按成分，增产部分全部归劳力。根据各地的经验，固定土地报酬数量的办法，比较有利于发挥社员劳动积极性。示范章程草案规定：土地报酬一般地应该由合作社议定固定的数量，不随着全社生产的发展而增加，以便全社生产发展的利益能够充分地用在劳动报酬方面和公共财产积累方面。这就是说，土地报酬不应该“水涨船高”，跟着生产的发展往上涨。只是在合作社初办的时候，特别是常遭自然灾害，土地产量比较不稳定的地方，还没把握议定土地报酬的固定数目，才可以暂时采用“活租制”的办法或者别的过渡办法。土地统一使用了，农业税应该由谁交呢？按示范章程草案的规定，既然社员还有土地报酬，农业税就应该由各户社员负担。如果由合作社负担农业税，那也可以；不过，社员的土地报酬就应该减少。
    土地报酬要比劳动报酬低
    合作社的土地报酬不可太多。示范章程草案明确地规定了：“土地报酬必须低于农业劳动报酬。”因为，只有这样才能鼓励社员参加集体劳动的积极性。对于这一点决不能马虎。如果土地报酬太高了，就会使土地少劳力强的受到土地多劳力少的人的变相剥削，这样的合作社就不是劳动人民的集体经济组织了，只能说是剥削分子掌握的假合作社。在这样的合作社里，劳力多土地少的农民觉得自己是在“给地多的户当长工”，劳动积极性当然不会高，也就很难增加生产。过去，土地和劳力的分配比例，常常成为合作社里争执最多的问题。土地多的农民总是强调“没有土地就长不出庄稼来，土地应当多分”，实际上，这是强词夺理，谁也不能否认，一切收益都是劳动创造出来的；土地却不是任何人创造的，而是开天辟地以来就有的，谁占的土地多谁就能多得到用劳动创造出来的东西，本来是没道理的事。在合作社的初级阶段，还给土地报酬，这已经是对占有土地多的人作了照顾。如果还嫌“照顾”得不够，还要比劳动报酬高，那就更没道理了。当然，合作社刚刚办起来，土地报酬也不能过分地少。各地都有一些土地非常少，劳动力又很缺的农户，一下子把土地报酬定的过低，他们就会发生困难，这点同样要加以注意。
    土地特别少、人口特别多的地方，人们把土地看得特别重。按示范章程草案规定，在这种情况下面，土地报酬也可以暂时相当于劳动报酬。不过，要这样做的话，得经过省级人民委员会许可；而且要注意，只可以是暂时相当于劳动报酬，不可以长期这样下去，也不可以高于劳动报酬。在相反的情况下面，在土地特别多、人口特别少的地方，比如东北、内蒙古的许多地方，即使在合作社初办的时候，也可以根据当地的习惯，把土地的报酬定得低些，或者不给土地报酬。因为，只要条件许可，减少或者取消土地报酬，增多劳动报酬或者完全按劳取酬，对鼓励劳动积极性、发展集体生产有很大好处。应当相信，全社会主义一定比半社会主义强。
    将来要取消土地报酬
    大家都知道，办合作社就是走社会主义的道路。社会主义的一条最重要的原则就是按劳取酬，这是最公道最合理的分配原则。前面已经说过，土地取得报酬，这是对土地私有观念的照顾，这和按劳取酬的原则是不完全符合的。合作社应该随着生产的发展，和社员觉悟水平的提高，慢慢提高劳动报酬，过渡到完全“按劳取酬”的高级农业生产合作社。示范章程草案第一章第三条里规定：“随着生产的发展和社员的社会主义觉悟的提高，合作社对于社员的土地逐步地取消报酬。”积极地增加生产，提高社会主义觉悟，创造条件，尽力争取过渡到高级社，是我们大家应该努力的目标。目前，有不少办得好的老社已经转变成高级社了，还有许多老社也正在积极准备转变；这是全国的农业生产合作社必然要走的道路。有人问：取消土地报酬以后，那些老弱孤寡户怎么办？这是不用担心的。合作社的生产发展了，他们参加轻微劳动的报酬也增加了。而且，合作社积累起来的公益金也会给他们越来越多的帮助。他们的收入是不会因此减少的。
    跟土地有密切关系的，还有许多实际问题。例如：对于带有青苗的土地怎样处理？土地上有塘、井、渠、坝等水利建设怎样办？对于社员私有的荒地、代种地、鱼塘、藕池、苇地等特殊土地怎样处理？等等。在示范章程草案上，对于这些问题都定出了合理的正确的解决办法。照顾到了各类社员的利益，也符合整个合作社的利益。总之，社员入社以前花费的劳动和投资，只要用到了正经地方，就一定不会白费。社里一定会照顾到社员应该得到的利益。当然，在处理这些问题的时候，也决不能损害全社的利益。按照示范章程草案的规定办事，一定能做到人人满意，一定能把合作社办好。
