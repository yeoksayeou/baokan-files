Financial Work in the Cooperative Must Have a Certain Plan and System
    He Cheng
    Many farmers who are preparing to join the cooperative and those who have joined recently are most worried that the various accounts of the cooperative will not be clear, that the leaders of the cooperative will spend money recklessly, and that those in charge of financial income and expenditure will "skim the oil." In fact, most cooperatives manage their finances very well, using the cooperative's financial resources mainly to increase production, and the cooperative's income is distributed clearly and reasonably, so that the cooperative's assets become larger year by year, and the income of the members also increases year by year. How do they achieve this? There are three main experiences: First, there must be a plan (spending money and things should not be done blindly and recklessly); second, there must be a system (not anyone who wants to use the cooperative's money and things can use them); third, there must be mass supervision (not just a few leaders and staff members of the cooperative making decisions on their own). These experiences have been summarized and written in the form of articles in the draft model regulations for agricultural production cooperatives.
      Formulating a Financial Plan
    As the saying goes, "Eating doesn't impoverish you, wearing doesn't impoverish you, but lack of planning impoverishes you for life." Agricultural production cooperatives have a large scale, with large inflows and outflows of money and materials. Without a plan, not knowing how much capital is on hand, when how much money can be earned, and not knowing how much money will be used in a year, and where and when it will be used, it will naturally be a matter of grabbing here and grabbing there, using what should not be used, and not using what should be used; it will also be a mess, with no money when money is needed, and too much money when money is not needed. Therefore, making a plan is a major task in financial management. The draft model regulations stipulate that the management committee of the agricultural production cooperative should, before the beginning of each production year, formulate an annual budget together with the formulation of the annual production plan, which is the financial income and expenditure plan for the whole year. This plan is divided into two parts: one part is where the funds come from and how they are used; the other part is how much the total annual production value (including agricultural and sideline production) is, how much production consumption should be deducted, how much can be retained for public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, and how much can be distributed to members.
    Where does the money come from? The main sources of funds for agricultural production cooperatives are three: one is the share capital paid by the members, of which the production cost share capital is consumed every year, but it must be deducted from the income every year as the production cost for the coming year; one is the production income, of which a part is the public accumulation fund left over from the previous year's production income (newly established cooperatives do not have this item), and another part is the partial income from agricultural and sideline production before the autumn harvest; and the other is the members' investment. Calculate these incomes, add them together, and you can see how much capital the cooperative has and how much it can do. After calculation, if the capital is not enough, what should be done? You can first mobilize the members to invest, and you can also find some production channels to expand the source of funds. If it is really necessary, you can also apply for loans from credit cooperatives or state banks. You can't borrow too much, because borrowing too much will divert the state's money for industrial investment, which is detrimental to the people of the whole country, and at the same time puts the agricultural production cooperative in debt. In a word, the cooperative itself must find ways to open up financial resources and try to achieve self-reliance.
    After the cooperative has calculated how much capital it has, it must then consider how to use this capital. The purpose of organizing the cooperative is to develop production, and the cooperative's funds should be used to develop production. All expenses that are not closely related to production relations must not use too much money, and the less money is used, the better. Production expenses should also be carefully calculated, saving money everywhere, using what should be used, and saving what can be saved. Of course, what should be used should not be saved excessively, and if what should be used more is also saved, production cannot be increased substantially, and as a result, members will not be able to increase their income more. In short, funds should be used where production needs them most. Some cooperatives, when they are first established, have very little capital, and they build offices and repair cattle and horse pens; they don't want weak livestock, they want to buy big mules and big horses; they don't use old furniture, they want to buy new furniture; they pay attention to ostentation and want to be阔气(kuò qì, extravagant), which is the most undesirable thing. In order to ensure that funds are used appropriately, to achieve high yield increase and low expenditure, each cooperative should, according to its own situation, stipulate the limits of various production costs. The expenses for seeds, fodder, fertilizer, and pesticides used in annual production, the cost of repairing farm tools and treating livestock, the remuneration for renting members' livestock, and production management fees, etc., must be stipulated at a certain amount. Expenses exceeding the stipulated amount are not allowed. According to the draft model regulations, production management fees (expenses for purchasing pens, ink, paper, stationery, and books, as well as travel expenses for members on official business, etc.) cannot exceed 1% of the total annual production value. After some cooperatives have stipulated the limits of various production costs, they also adopt the method of "contracting," distributing the funds that can be distributed to each production team to each team for contracted use to ensure increased production. Rewards are given for savings, and punishments are given for embezzlement or waste. This method is very effective in ensuring the saving of funds.
    Another part of the financial income and expenditure plan is to calculate how much the total annual production value is, how much production consumption should be deducted, how much can be retained for public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, and how much can be distributed to members. Cooperatives cannot just put in capital without caring about the harvest. Members labor in the cooperative, subscribe for shares, and invest for the purpose of increasing production and increasing income. In order to ensure that members can increase their income and ensure that production can be expanded in the coming year, the cooperative must convert the total annual income according to the targets stipulated in the production plan to see how much it is in total. Deduct production costs from it, retain public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, and then calculate the approximate number of members' income. In this way, the various figures for the distribution of the cooperative's total annual income can be seen clearly.
    There are many benefits to formulating a financial income and expenditure plan: First, funds can be prepared in a planned way, used where they should be used, and used when they should be used, so as not to waste funds, or not use them when they should be used, and leave the funds idle. Second, it allows members to know where the funds come from and where they are used, so that they have a clear idea. This makes it convenient for members to check and supervise financial work. Third, it allows members to know how much the cooperative can increase production, how much strength it has, and how much they can earn, so that they have hope and motivation, and can encourage members to work hard.
    Establishing a Financial System
    The financial management of cooperatives should not only have a plan, but also establish some necessary financial systems.
    Generally speaking, formulating a financial income and expenditure plan is relatively easy to do; it is not simple to actually use money and materials. As soon as cooperative production starts, look, dozens of members, hundreds of members, today you want this, tomorrow he wants that; there is something to spend money on here, and there is something to buy there. Although the expenditure is planned, things often do not go according to plan. As long as the person in charge moves his mind, and the person in charge of money loosens his hand, the expenditure will be chaotic. Moreover, some people are influenced by the exploiting classes, and it is not guaranteed that there will be no things that are convenient for themselves and take advantage of everyone, and some people may even have embezzlement and theft. In this way, wouldn't the plan become an empty plan? In order to prevent the plan from becoming an empty plan, and everyone acts according to the plan, it is necessary to set a rule for using money. That is to say, to build some checkpoints. No matter what the item is, as long as the cooperative's money is taken out, it must pass through certain checkpoints. The members' meeting is the most important checkpoint. The annual financial income and expenditure plan must be reviewed and approved by the members' meeting to be valid. The director of the cooperative is also a checkpoint. Ordinary expenses within the financial income and expenditure plan must pass through the checkpoint of the director of the cooperative and be approved by him before they can be spent. The management committee is a checkpoint. Larger expenses within the plan must pass through this checkpoint and be approved by it before they can be spent. Sometimes, something happens temporarily that requires money, which was not expected when making the financial income and expenditure plan, and this money needs to be used, so the budget must be added. Such expenses must also be reviewed and approved by the members' meeting before they can be spent. The accountant is a major general guarding the property of the cooperative; the draft model regulations stipulate that he has this great power, and the accountant can refuse to pass all expenses that do not conform to the rules and procedures. No matter if you are the director of the cooperative or a member of the management committee, if you don't follow the rules, he will not let you pass. In this way, the big checkpoints manage big expenses, the small checkpoints manage small expenses, and one checkpoint after another manages, and the use of money will not be chaotic. It will not be easy for anyone who wants to take advantage or embezzle.
    As mentioned above, the accountant is the person who guards the checkpoints when it comes to using the cooperative's money and property. However, the accounting work itself is also easy to get into "unclear accounts." Many members of the cooperative say, "As long as you don't eat糊涂面(hú tu miàn, muddled noodles), you are willing to be exhausted to death." Everyone is afraid of the "muddled accounts" kept by the accountant. The task of the accountant is very important. He should be honest and diligent, and strive to study his business, so as not to miss a single account, not to record a wrong account, and every account should be "documented" and recorded on the basis of vouchers. The accountant and the cashier should also be separated. The accountant only manages the accounts, and the cashier only manages the money. The person in charge of money cannot withdraw money casually without procedures. In this way, the accounts are clear and the procedures are clear, and the members can rest assured and actively work.
    In addition to money, there are many other public properties and public things in the cooperative. In some cooperatives, public things are thrown around and no one cares, like this, no matter how big the family property is, no matter how much income there is, it cannot withstand waste and loss. Therefore, some methods should also be formulated for the safekeeping of public property. The best way is to assign special personnel to be responsible for safekeeping, and distribute them to each production team, custodian, feeder, and technician for safekeeping. To use public things, there must be borrowing and returning procedures. Every public property must be registered. When you want to know how much property the cooperative has, take out the list and you can see it clearly. All public properties must also be checked on time to see if there is any loss or damage. In this way, on the one hand, everyone can be urged to be responsible for public property, and on the other hand, things that are damaged can be repaired in time.
    With procedures and methods for money income and expenditure and material safekeeping, will there be no problems? Not necessarily. In some cooperatives, the financial system is not lacking, but there are still things that damage public property. In some cooperatives, there are even things that embezzle and steal public property. What should be done if this kind of thing happens? That should be dealt with according to the seriousness of the circumstances. The draft model regulations stipulate that if a member of the cooperative embezzles, steals, or damages public property, or is irresponsible and causes serious losses to public property, he shall be liable for compensation and shall be punished. Minor circumstances shall be subject to minor punishment, serious circumstances shall be subject to serious punishment, and serious circumstances shall also be referred to the court for prosecution.
    Everyone Supervises Financial Work
    All the funds and all the property of the agricultural production cooperative are the capital for the development of the cooperative's production and are exchanged for the labor of the members. Waste of funds and damage to public property are the losses of every member. Every member of the cooperative should save the cooperative's funds and cherish the cooperative's public property. They should supervise each other, and no one is allowed to waste funds and damage public property. The staff of the cooperative should promote democracy and let all members check and supervise financial work. The accounts of the cooperative should be published on time. The accounts of the members' workdays should be published once a month and every production quarter, so that the members can check and verify whether they have been recorded incorrectly; at the same time, let the members know how much work they have done, and those who have done less can quickly make up for it. In addition to being published every month, the financial expenditure accounts should also be published at the end of each year to let everyone check whether the expenditure is in accordance with the plan and system, and whether the expenditure is reasonable. The list of public property should also be published at the end of each year to let the members know what public property has been added in the past year and whether there has been any loss of public property. In this way, everyone has a clear idea, and everyone knows the ins and outs of all the funds and property of the cooperative, and embezzlement and waste will not happen, and the members' "financial affairs" can be handled well.
    The accounts are settled and published regularly, but the financial work is done every day. In order to ensure that there are no problems in the work at ordinary times, the supervisory committee of the cooperative should also regularly check the various accounts of the cooperative, and if there are any problems, solve them in time.
    The cooperative's financial work has a plan, a system, and mass supervision, so there will be no problems, and it can well guarantee the development of the entire cooperative's production.

    社里财务工作要有一定的计划和制度
    何成
    很多准备入社的农民和入社不久的农民，最担心合作社的各种账目算不清，怕社里的领导人员乱花钱，怕管钱财出入的人“抽油水”。其实，绝大部分合作社都把财务管得很好，把社里的财力主要用到了增加生产方面，社里的收益分配得又清楚又合理，使合作社的家底一年比一年大，社员的收入也一年比一年多。它们是怎样做到了这样的呢？主要的经验有三条：第一，要有计划（用钱用东西不是瞎用乱用）；第二，要有制度（不是谁想用社里的钱和东西谁就可以用）；第三，要有群众监督（不是社里的少数领导人员和工作人员自作主张）。这些经验，已经总结起来，用条文的形式写在农业生产合作社示范章程草案上了。
      制定财务计划
    俗话说：“吃不穷，穿不穷，打算不到一世穷。”农业生产合作社家大业大，银钱物资是大出大进。如果没有个计划，不知道手上有多少资金，什么时候可以收入多少钱，也不知道一年当中要用多少钱，用在哪里，什么时候用。这样，自然就会东抓一把，西抓一把，该用的不用，不该用的用了；也就会弄得乱七八糟，要用钱的时候没有钱，不用钱的时候钱又多了。因此，做计划是财务管理的一件大事情。示范章程草案规定：农业生产合作社管理委员会应该在每个生产年度开始以前，跟制定全年生产计划一起，制定年度预算，也就是全年的财务收支计划。这个计划分两部分：一部分是资金从哪里来？怎样用？一部分是全年的生产总值（包括农业的和副业的）有多少？生产消耗应该扣除多少？公积金、公益金能留多少？社员能分配多少？
    资金从哪里来？农业生产合作社的资金来源主要有三个：一个是社员交来的股份基金，其中生产费股份基金是每年都要消耗掉的，但是每年都要从收入当中扣除下来，作为来年的生产费；一个是生产的收入，其中一部分是从上年生产收入中留下来的公积金（新建立的合作社没有这一项），另一部分是秋季收获以前农业和副业生产的部分收入；还有一个是社员的投资。把这几项收入计算好，加起来，就能够看清楚社里有多大本钱，能办多大的事情。经过计算，如果本钱不够，该怎么办呢？可以先发动社员投资，还可以找一些生产门路，扩大资金的来源。确实有必要，也可以向信用合作社或国家银行申请贷款。贷款不能借多了，借多了就扯了国家对工业投资的钱，对全国人民不利，同时也让农业生产合作社背了债。总之一句话，合作社自己要想办法开辟财源，尽量做到自力更生。
    合作社有多少本钱算清楚了，接着就要打算怎样使用这些本钱。合作社组织起来为的是发展生产，合作社的资金，要用到发展生产方面去。一切和生产关系不大的开支，决不能多用钱，用钱越少越好。生产方面的开支，也不能够想到就用，要精打细算，处处节约，当用的用，能省就省。当然，该用的也不要过分节省，把该多用的也节省掉了，就不能大量增加生产，结果也会使社员不能更多增加收入。总之，要把资金用在生产最需要的地方。有些合作社，刚办起来，家底还很空，就盖办公室，修牛马圈，不要弱牲口，要买大骡子、大马；不用旧家具，要买新家具；凡事讲排场，要阔气，这最要不得。为了保证资金使用得恰当，做到增产高，开支少，各个合作社应该根据本社的情况，规定出各项生产费用的限额。每年生产要用的种子、草料、肥料、农药的开支，修理农具、医治牲口的费用，租用社员牲口的报酬，生产管理费等，都要规定一定的数目。超过规定的数目，就不许开支。按照示范章程草案的规定，生产管理费（购买笔、墨、纸张、账簿以及社员因公出差等费用）不能超过全年生产总值的百分之一。有些合作社规定了各项生产费用的限额以后，还采取“包干”的办法，把能够分给各个生产队使用的资金分给各队，由各队包干使用，保证增产。对节约了的给予奖励，贪污或浪费了的给予处分。这种办法对于保证节约资金很有作用。
    财务收支计划的另一个部分是计算全年的生产总值有多少，生产消耗该扣多少，公积金、公益金能留多少，社员能分多少。合作社不能只下本钱，不管收成。社员在社内劳动，入了股，投了资，为的是增加生产，增加收入。为了保证社员能够增加收入，保证来年的生产能够扩大，合作社要把全年的收入按照生产计划规定的指标折算出来，看看一共有多少。从里面扣除生产费，留出公积金、公益金，然后算出社员收入的大体数字。这样，合作社全年收入分配的各项数字就可以看清楚了。
    制定财务收支计划有很多好处：第一，可以有计划地筹备资金，该用到什么上面就用到什么上面，该什么时候用就什么时候用，不至于浪费资金，或者当用不用，把资金白白地压起来。第二，可以让社员知道资金从哪里来，用到哪里去，心中有数。这样，社员来检查、监督财务工作就方便了。第三，可以让社员知道合作社能增产多少，有多大力量，自己能收入多少，有指望，有奔头，可以鼓励社员好好劳动。
    规定财务制度
    合作社的财务管理不只要有计划，还要订立一些必要的财务制度。
    一般说来，制定财务收支计划这件事，还是比较好办的；银钱物资真正动用起来，可就不简单了。合作社生产一开始，看吧，几十个社员，几百个社员，今天你要这样，明天他要那样；这里有件事要花钱，那里有样东西需要买。开支虽然定了计划，可是事情常常会不按计划走。只要当家的人心里一活动，管钱的人松松手，开支就乱了。况且，有些人受了剥削阶级的影响，为自己方便、占大家点便宜的事保不准就没有，甚至于有的人还会有贪污、盗窃行为。像这样，计划不就会变成空计划了吗？为了让计划不变成空计划，人人都照着计划办事，就要定出一个用钱的规矩来。这就是说，要筑起一些关口。不论什么用项，只要社里的钱往外拿，就要经过一定的关口。社员大会是一道最重要的关口，每年的财务收支计划，都要经过社员大会审查批准才算数。社主任也是一道关口。财务收支计划以内的普通的开支，要经过社主任这道关口，要他批准了才能开支。管理委员会是一道关口，计划以内比较大的开支，要经过这一道关口，在它这里通过了才能开支。有时候，临时发生了什么必须用钱的事，是做财务收支计划的时候没有料到的，要用这笔钱，就得追加预算。像这样的开支，也要经过社员大会审查批准了，才能开支。会计员是保卫社里的财产的一员守关大将；一切不合规矩、不合手续的开支，会计员都可以不让过关。示范章程草案上规定了他有这个大权。不管你是社主任也好，管理委员也好，不照着规矩来，他就不让通过。像这样，大关管大的开支，小关管小的开支，一关一关地管着，用钱就不会乱了。谁要想占便宜、想贪污也就不好办了。
    上面说，会计员在动用社里的钱财上是守关口的人。可是会计工作本身，也容易搞得“账目不清”。许多合作社的社员都说：“只要不吃糊涂面，累死也情愿。”谁都怕会计员记的“糊涂账”。会计员的任务是很重大的，应该廉洁奉公，努力钻研业务，做到不记漏一笔账，不记错一笔账，每一笔账都“有凭有据”都是凭单据记的。会计和出纳还要分开来，会计员光管账，出纳员光管钱。管钱的不管账，管账的不管钱。管钱的人没有手续不能随便支钱。这样，账目清楚了手续也清楚了，社员大家就可以放心地积极劳动了。
    合作社里除了银钱以外还有别的许多公共的财产和公用的东西。有些合作社，公共的东西乱扔乱放，谁见了也不管，像这样，家底再大，收入再多，也顶不住浪费和损失。因此，对于公共财产的保管，也要定出一些办法来。最好的办法就是专人负责保管，分给各生产队、保管员、饲养员、技术员来保管。动用公共的东西，要有借用和归还的手续。每一件公共财物，都要登记起来。什么时候要知道社里有了多少家当，拿出单子一看，就可以一清二楚。一切公共财产，还要按时清点，看看有没有丢失和损坏。这样，一方面可以督促大家对公共财产负责，一方面可以对用坏了的东西及时修理。
    银钱出入，物资保管都有了手续和办法，是不是就不会发生问题了呢？不一定。有一些合作社，财务制度不是没有，但是还发生损坏公共财产的事。有些合作社，甚至还发生了贪污、盗窃公共财产的事。如果发生这类事情，怎么办呢？那要根据情节轻重来处理。示范章程草案规定：合作社社员如果贪污、盗窃、破坏了公共财产，或者不负责任，让公共财产受了重大的损失，都要负责赔偿，并且要受处分。情节轻的受轻的处分，重的受重的处分，情节严重的，还要请法院来办罪。
    大家监督财务工作
    农业生产合作社的一切资金，一切财产，都是合作社发展生产的本钱，都是社员的劳动换来的。浪费了资金，损坏了公共财产，就是每一个社员的损失。合作社的每一个社员，都应当节省合作社的资金，爱护合作社的公共财产。要互相监督，谁也不许浪费资金和损坏公共财产。合作社的工作人员，要发扬民主，让全体社员都来检查和监督财务工作。合作社的账目要按时公布。社员的劳动日的账目，每月、每个生产季度都要公布一次，让社员来检查和核对有没有记错；同时，让社员知道自己做了多少工，做少了的可以赶紧补上。财务开支的账，除了每月公布以外，每个年度结束的时候，还要把全年的开支情况公布出来，让社员大家来检查，看是不是按计划，按制度开支的，开支是不是合理。公共财产的清单，也要在每个年度结账的时候公布出来，让社员知道一年中间，添了哪些公共财产，公共财产有没有损失。这样，人人心中有数，人人都知道合作社一切资金、财产的来龙去脉，贪污、浪费的事情就发生不了，社员的“财务事”就能办好。
    账目是定期结算，按期公布，可是，财务工作是天天在做。为了让工作平常都不出问题，合作社的监察委员会，还要定期检查合作社的各种账目，有了问题，就及时解决。
    合作社的财务工作有计划，有制度，又有群众的监督，就能够不出问题，就能够很好地保证全社生产的发展。
