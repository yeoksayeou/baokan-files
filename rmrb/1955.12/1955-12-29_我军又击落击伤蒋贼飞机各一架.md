Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The frontline anti-aircraft artillery units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army shot down and damaged one Chiang bandit plane each.

At 15:36 on the 28th, four U.S.-made Chiang bandit F-84 fighter jets intruded into the Shantou area to conduct harassing activities. A certain unit of the anti-aircraft artillery troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Shantou area immediately intercepted the enemy planes with accurate and fierce artillery fire. Two U.S.-made Chiang bandit planes were hit at that time. One of them crashed into the sea near Nanpeng Island; the other escaped, trailing thick smoke.
