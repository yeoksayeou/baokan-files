    Literary Work and the Standardization of Chinese
    Xia Yan
    The work of standardizing Chinese is a very important link in China's socialist construction cause and also a major event in the cultural life of the more than five hundred million people who use the Chinese language. Literary and art workers bear extremely important responsibilities in this work, just as the "People's Daily" editorial "Strive to Promote Chinese Character Reform, Popularize Mandarin, and Achieve Chinese Standardization" stated:
    The standardization of language must be entrusted to tangible things. First and foremost, this refers to all works, especially literary works, because the standardization of language is mainly spread through works. The degree to which writers and translators value or disregard the standardization of language has an immeasurable impact, and we must make particularly strict demands on them. Radio broadcasters, film and drama actors are also propagandists for language standardization. Countless viewers and listeners consciously or unconsciously learn from them every day. They have made great contributions to the promotion of Mandarin in the past. In the future, as Mandarin is systematically promoted throughout the country, they will play an even greater role, and naturally, they must strengthen the standardization of their own language. To say that this is a "particularly strict requirement" can actually be said to be a necessary and minimal requirement. Literary and art workers are different from ordinary people. They must work through language and writing, and their language and writing affect millions of readers, viewers, and listeners every day and every hour. Literary and art workers are "people who have a demonstrative effect on language use." Therefore, if their language can be pure, accurate, refined, and beautiful, then through their own work, they will unconsciously promote the standardization of Chinese to an extremely great extent. Conversely, if their language is chaotic, their writing is incomprehensible, they abuse dialects, or "create adjectives that no one but themselves understands," then it is actually equivalent to using the most powerful means of publicity, such as publishing, performing, broadcasting, and showing, to carry out an intolerable destruction of the motherland's language.
    In his many talks and reports to newspaper correspondents and young writers, Kalinin repeatedly emphasized the importance of using Russian correctly. He said, "If a person is not familiar with grammar... what kind of writer is he?" He also said, "Anyone who wants to write seriously must study. He must pick up a grammar textbook and study it tirelessly." He also said, "Without a true command of the national language, no one will ever become a true writer." (Kalinin: "The Writer Must Become a Master of His Craft," "Collection of Bolshevik Press," People's Publishing House) Are these words excessive? Are these words not equally applicable to Chinese literary and art workers?
    It should be acknowledged that since the "People's Daily" published the editorial "Correctly Use the Motherland's Language and Strive for the Purity and Health of Language!" in June 1951, literary and art workers have done a great deal of work for the healthy development of language, and accumulated habits such as grammatical confusion and the abuse of abbreviated language have also been initially corrected. However, when we examine the literary works in newspapers and periodicals, the dramas being performed, or the films being shown, has every literary and art worker seriously paid attention to the purity and health of language in their own work? Many examples prove that the call of the Party and the government has not aroused enough attention from literary and art workers.
    The language of poetry should be the most beautiful, refined, and clear, but in our poetry creation, the phenomenon of language confusion is serious, and even some famous poets' works have this problem. Some poems published in literary journals are not only incomprehensible to the ear, but also incomprehensible to the eye. For example: The heart is held in the hand,... the heart is in someone's mouth,... the heart first violates the heart's teaching:… (from "Dedicated to the Volunteers," published in the January 1954 issue of "People's Literature") These sentences are not only ungrammatical, but also make it impossible for readers to guess the author's original intention. In the same poem, there are also the following sentences:
    The scene is so good, the tone is so loud,...
    We have also listened to reports,...
    In another poem by the same author, "Ode to Mother" (published in the second issue of "New China Women" in 1954), there are similar sentences:
    The sun comes out and sees her washing urine;…
    Here, in order to rhyme, the poet stiffly abbreviated "loud and clear" to "loud," "reports" to "report," and "washing diapers" to "washing urine," how can this be understood by readers?
    To give another example at random, there is a poem entitled "Rainbow" in the October issue of "People's Literature," one section of which contains ungrammatical and incomprehensible sentences:
    When I was young, I had seen a rainbow—
    That was when I was sitting in my mother's arms,
    I followed her arm pointing to the horizon,
    Counting the geese flying across the autumn sky at dusk;…
    In novels and dramas, in addition to the same problems of being ungrammatical and creating new words, there is also a more common tendency to abuse dialects. There are too many examples of this kind. In the novel "The Hurricane," there are many very difficult-to-understand northeastern dialects, such as: "Xia Wan Zha Gu Ding," "Xiao Ga," "Mai Tai," "I don't mind fooling you, but you disgust me," etc.; there are also a particularly large number of dialects in the script "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River." When this play was performed in Shanghai, the director and actors spent a great deal of effort learning the dialects, but the result was that most of the audience could not understand it. This was not only "laborious and unrewarding," but also weakened the original effect of the script.
    Film is the most popular art. The language of film literature directly demonstrates and propagates to hundreds of millions of people. However, in our film scripts, language confusion is still a very common phenomenon. Some are ungrammatical, some are illogical, and some abuse abbreviated language. To give just a few examples from the commentary of documentary films: The solemn and beautiful winter of Beijing has once again welcomed the spring of blooming flowers. (News documentary "Deep Mountain Treasure Hunt") The songs of the Tibetan shepherdesses sing the praises of the beauty of their hometown, the freedom and happiness of life, and sing the praises of the Communist Party. (Ibid.) But in the past, Japanese imperialists used barbaric means of bunkers, barbed wire, and artillery to plunder this iron mountain. (Ibid.) In the September of the motherland,... (Ibid.) The masses have come from afar to welcome and send off the people who laid the foundation for the construction of a steel factory here. (Ibid.) The roads of the Qilian Mountains are both beautiful and dangerous. (Ibid.) The bright landscape on the tea tray. (News documentary "Folk Arts and Crafts") The representatives deeply realized that the general policy and general line of the Land Reform Law are completely in line with the interests of the vast number of peasants themselves.
    (News documentary "Great Land Reform") A minor illness requires ten and a half months of labor insurance. (News documentary "Comrade Trial Meeting") The commentary on the film is different from the text printed in books and periodicals. It is impossible to repeat it when you don't understand it. Comrade Lao She said it well: "The ear is not as patient as the eye. Hearing an unpleasant word or a difficult-to-understand sentence will immediately make you impatient" (Lao She: "The Language of Folk Literature," "Chinese Language," July 1952). Therefore, in addition to being grammatically correct, concise, and clear, it must also be understood as soon as it is heard. However, in our documentary commentary—and even in the dialogue of feature films, archaic words and sentence structures such as "in view of," "and there are," "but," "then there are," etc., which are not easy to understand or are easily misunderstood, are still very common.
    We do not mechanically oppose the use of "classical Chinese," nor do we necessarily require that the word "之" be translated as "的." We can still use sentence structures and vocabulary that everyone can speak, everyone can understand, and that still have life today. It is of course perfectly acceptable for a film to be called "The Road to Happiness," but wouldn't it be better to change it to "The Road of Happiness"? A New Year picture is called "Spring Morning," why not just honestly call it "Spring Morning"?
    In features and communications, the situation of impure, unhealthy, and inconsistent language is also quite serious. Even in recent newspapers and periodicals, we have seen the so-called "Concord language" left over from the period of Japanese imperialist aggression against China more than once. An article reporting on industrial production mentioned "huang zha" and "huang bao" more than once. "Huang" means "rough" in Japanese. Why not say "rough rolling" and "rough planing"? Another communication exposing counter-revolutionaries said: "This person is simply like a kenkai." "Kenkai" means "overseer" in Japanese. Why not change it to "overseer"?
    The above is only the grammatical problem in the standardization of Chinese. As for the "pronunciation" problem with Beijing pronunciation as the standard, it has not yet aroused serious attention from drama, film, and broadcasting workers. According to a recent survey by the Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences, the situation of non-standard pronunciation in the two national drama academies in Beijing is very serious. Among the 160-odd actors in the two academies, only 24 or 25 meet the minimum required standard in terms of pronunciation and enunciation. That is to say, 85 percent of the drama actors have not undergone rigorous pronunciation training. If this is the case in the national drama academies in Beijing, the situation in other regions can be imagined.
    The continued existence of language confusion is a political damage to the interests of the people. Therefore, we must regard the unification of language and the standardization of Chinese as a serious political task. Literary and art workers have to work through language, and their language often plays a demonstrative role among the broad masses of the people. Therefore, in the vigorous promotion of Mandarin and the realization of Chinese standardization, literary and art workers have particularly important responsibilities. Let us all take on this glorious task earnestly in accordance with the principles of overall planning and strengthened leadership.

    文艺工作和汉语规范化
    夏衍
    汉语规范化工作是我国社会主义建设事业中的一个很重要的环节，也是我国五亿以上使用汉语人民的文化生活中的一件大事。在这一工作中，文学艺术工作者负有极其重大的责任，正如“人民日报”社论“为促进汉字改革、推广普通话、实现汉语规范化而努力”中所说：
    语言的规范必须寄托在有形的东西上。这首先是一切作品，特别重要的是文学作品，因为语言的规范主要是通过作品传播开来的。作家们和翻译工作者们重视或不重视语言的规范，影响所及是难以估计的，我们不能不对他们提出特别严格的要求。电台广播员、电影和话剧演员，他们也都是语言规范的宣传家，每天有无数的观众和听众有意识地或无意识地在向他们学习。他们在普通话的推广上，过去已经有过很大的功劳，今后在全国范围内有计划地推广普通话的情况下，他们将起更大的作用，自然也就必须加强自己的语言的规范性。说这是“特别严格的要求”，其实也可以说这是应有的、起码的要求。文艺工作者不同于一般人，他们必须通过语言文字来进行工作，他们的语言文字每日每时影响着千千万万的读者、观众和听众。文艺工作者是“在语言使用上有示范作用的人”，所以，他们的语言能够做到纯洁、准确、精炼、优美，那么通过他们本身的业务，不知不觉地就会对汉语规范化起极其巨大的推进作用；相反，假如他们的语言混乱、文理不通、滥用土语，或者“生造除自己之外，谁也不懂的形容词之类”，那么实际上就等于通过出版、上演、广播、放映等等最有力的宣传方式，对祖国的语言进行不可容忍的破坏。
    加里宁在他对报纸通讯员和青年作家的多次谈话和报告中一再地强调正确地运用俄语的重要性。他说：“如果一个人不熟悉文法……他是一个什么作家呢？”又说：“谁要是想认真地写作，他就必须学习。必须拿起文法教科书，并且手不释卷，用它来学习。”又说：“没有国语的真正修养，任何人永远也不会成为真正的作家。”（加里宁：“作家必须成为本行的能手”，“布尔什维克报刊文集”，人民出版社出版）难道这些话说得过分了吗？难道这些话不是同样地对中国的文艺工作者十分适用的吗？
    应该承认，自从一九五一年六月“人民日报”发表了“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！”的社论以来，文艺工作者已经为语言的健康发展做了许多工作，语法混乱、滥用省略语等类积习，也已经有了初步的纠正。但是，检查一下报刊上的文艺作品、上演的戏剧或者放映的电影，是不是每一个文艺工作者都已经认真地在自己的工作中注意到语言的纯洁和健康了呢？许多事例证明：党和政府的号召还没有引起文艺工作者的足够的重视。
    诗的语言，应该是最优美、精炼和明确的，可是在我们的诗歌创作中，语言混乱现象却是严重的，甚至有些著名的诗人的作品也有这毛病。有一些发表在文学刊物上的诗，不仅听不懂，而且是看不懂的。举例说：心在手捧上，……心在一个人口里，……心先违了心的教：……（一九五四年一月号“人民文学”所载“献给志愿军”）这些句子不仅不合语法，而且使读者猜不透作者的原意。在同一首诗中，还有下列的句子：
    场面这么好，音调这么嘹，……
    我们也曾听过报，……
    在同一作者的另一首诗“母亲颂”（载一九五四年第二号“新中国妇女”）中也有类似的句子：
    太阳出来望见她洗尿；……
    这里，诗人为了押韵，生硬地把“嘹亮”略成了“嘹”，把“报告”略成了“报”，把“洗尿布”略成了“洗尿”，这怎么能使读者看得懂呢？
    再随手举一个例子，今年十月的“人民文学”中有一首题名“虹”的诗，其中一节就有不合语法的、费解的句子：
    年幼的时候我是看见过虹的——
    那是当我坐在母亲底怀抱里，
    我顺着她向天边遥指的手臂，
    数着航过秋空的雁群的黄昏；……
    在小说和戏剧中，除了同样地有不合语法、生造词汇的毛病之外，还有一种比较普遍的倾向，就是滥用土语。这一类例子太多了，在小说“暴风骤雨”中，有许多十分难懂的东北土语，例如：“下晚扎古丁”，“小嘎”，“埋汰”，“我不嫌唬你，你倒各应我来啦”等等；在剧本“春风吹到诺敏河”里土语也特别多，上海演出这出戏的时候，导演和演员花了很大的力量来学土语，结果反而使大部分观众听不懂，这不仅“吃力不讨好”，而且削弱了剧本原有的效果。
    电影是最富于群众性的艺术，电影文学的语言直接向亿万人民群众进行着示范和宣传，可是在我们的电影剧本中，语言混乱也还是很普遍的现象，有些是不合语法，有些是不合逻辑，有些是滥用省略语。单举几部纪录影片的说明辞来作例子：庄严美丽的北京的冬天，又迎接了百花开放的春天。（新闻纪录片“深山探宝”）藏族牧羊姑娘的歌声里，唱的是赞美自己家乡的美丽，生活的自由和幸福，歌颂着共产党。（同上）但是过去日本帝国主义者曾利用碉堡、铁丝网和大炮的野蛮手段，掠夺过这个铁山。（同上）在祖国的九月里，……（同上）群众都远道来欢送，欢送为这里建设钢铁厂奠基的人们。（同上）祁连山的道路上既美丽，又危险。（同上）在茶盘上明媚的山水。（新闻纪录影片“民间美术工艺”）代表们深刻地体会了土地改革法的总政策总路线，是完全符合广大农民自己的利益的。
    （新闻纪录影片“伟大的土地改革”）一点小病就吃十天半个月的劳保。（新闻纪录影片“同志审判会”）影片上的说明辞不同于印在书刊上的文字，听不懂的时候不可能重复一遍的，老舍同志说得好：“耳朵不像眼睛那么有耐性儿，听到一个不受听的字，或一句不易懂的话，马上就不耐烦”（老舍：“民间文艺的语言”，一九五二年七月号“中国语文”），所以除了文理通顺、简洁明快之外，还必须听到就懂，可是在我们的纪录片说明辞中——甚至故事片的对话中，像“鉴于”、“且有”、“但在”、“则有”等等不容易听懂的、或者容易误会的文言词汇和句法，也还是很普遍的。
    我们并不机械地反对使用“文言”，也不一定要求把“之”字都翻译为“的”字，大家能讲、人人能懂的、许多直到今天还有生命的句法和词汇，我们依旧可以使用。一张影片叫做“幸福之路”，自然没有什么不可以，但是如果改成“幸福的道路”不是更好些吗？一张年画叫做“春之晨”，为什么不老老实实就叫它“春天的早晨”呢？
    在特写、通讯中，语言不纯洁、不健康、不统一的情况也相当严重，甚至在最近的报刊上，我们还不止一次看到过日本帝国主义侵略中国时期留下来的所谓“协和语”。一篇报导工业生产的文章中不止一次提到“荒轧”，“荒刨”。“荒”是日本语的“粗”的意思，为什么不说“粗轧”和“粗刨”呢？另一篇揭露反革命分子的通讯中说：“这个人简直像一个见回”。“见回”是日本语“监工”的意思，为什么不改为“监工”呢？
    以上所说，还只是汉语规范化中的语法上的问题，至于以北京语为标准音的“正音”问题，也还没有引起戏剧、电影、广播工作者严肃的注意。据科学院语言研究所最近调查的结果，北京两个国立话剧院的语音不标准的情况是十分严重的。两院一共一百六十几个演员中，在发音咬字上只有二十四、五人合乎最低要求的标准，也就是说，还有百分之八十五的话剧演员，还没有经过严格的正音训练。在北京的国立剧院尚且如此，在其他地区的情况，也就可想而知了。
    语言混乱现象的继续存在，在政治上是对于人民利益的损害，因此我们必须把语言的统一、汉语规范化当作一个严肃的政治任务。文艺工作者要通过语言来进行工作，而他们的语言又经常要在广大的人民群众中起示范作用，因此，在大力推广普通话和实现汉语规范化工作中，文艺工作者的责任是特别重大的。让我们大家按照全面规划、加强领导的方针，认真地把这一个光荣的任务担当起来吧。
