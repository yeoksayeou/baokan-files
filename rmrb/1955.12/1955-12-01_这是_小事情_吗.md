    Is This a "Small Matter"?
    Chen Zhao
    The work of "Three Fixes" for grain distribution to households has concluded, but the registers recording the "fixed production," "fixed purchase," and "fixed sales" figures for grain remain a chaotic mess—this is a common phenomenon recently discovered by various counties in the Yichang Special District of Hubei Province during their inspection of the technical work of the "Three Fixes" for grain. Zhang Changyao, who was responsible for the "Three Fixes" statistics in Majia Township, Yuan'an County, changed his entitled 750 jin of rations to 950 jin, and changed the supply grain his relative was supposed to buy from 353 jin to 521 jin. In Anle Township of the same county, a rich peasant who was in charge of compiling the registers tried every means to win over backward peasants, conceal yields, alter figures, and undermine the work of the "Three Fixes" for grain distribution to households.
    The counties in the Yichang Special District are currently taking concrete measures to rectify the statistical and registration work of the "Three Fixes" for grain. In Yidu County, eight districts purged five bad elements, including former puppet Bao chiefs, who had infiltrated the ranks. In Herong District of Dangyang County, 370 statisticians were trained in eighteen townships to strengthen the work of compiling registers. Yuan'an County transferred 55 staff members from county-level organs to form guidance groups, which were dispatched to various districts to provide specific guidance to registration staff. Many counties have also formed inspection teams to conduct巡回 inspections in various townships. These measures are very necessary.
    The chaotic phenomenon of grain "Three Fixes" registers and statistical work is by no means unique to the Yichang Special District; this problem exists in most areas where the "Three Fixes" work for grain has been completed or is about to be completed. Some staff members believe that the work is done once the grain "Three Fixes" figures are reasonably determined for each household, and they have relaxed their leadership over these necessary technical tasks. However, they did not realize that if they do not pay attention to such "small matters" as register compilation, then the "Three Fixes" figures that they painstakingly investigated, repeatedly calculated, and determined through mass democratic appraisal may end up as a pile of muddled accounts in the hands of registration staff, or even undermine the achievements of the grain "Three Fixes" work. In the past two years of grain unified purchase and sale work, one of the main reasons for some unreasonable purchase and sale phenomena was precisely that the national grain organs did not have time to grasp the basic situation of grain production, purchase, supply, and consumption in various regions. Now, we have the opportunity to sort out a set of statistical data on grain production, purchase, supply, and consumption based on the "Three Fixes" for grain. This data is an extremely important basis for doing a good job in grain unified purchase and sale work in the future. With it, future grain work can avoid some of the shortcomings and mistakes that have occurred in the past. But if these statistical data are inaccurate, or have been tampered with, it will inevitably repeat the chaotic phenomenon of grain unified purchase and sale in rural areas, causing dissatisfaction among the peasants. In this way, there can be no talk of institutionalizing grain work.
    Currently, many areas are still carrying out the work of "Three Fixes" for grain distribution to households. The party committees and governments in these areas should take effective measures in a timely manner to do a good job in the "Three Fixes" statistics and register compilation. Those areas that have completed the "Three Fixes" work for grain should also conduct necessary inspections and rectifications of the grain "Three Fixes" registers and numerical data.

    这是“小事情”吗
    陈昭
    粮食“三定”到户工作已经结束，但是登记粮食“定产”“定购”“定销”数字的册籍还是一团混乱——这是湖北省宜昌专区各县最近检查粮食“三定”的技术工作中所发现的普遍现象。远安县马家乡担任粮食“三定”统计工作的张长耀，把他应留的七百五十斤口粮改为九百五十斤，把他的一个亲戚应买的供应粮三百五十三斤改为五百二十一斤。该县安乐乡有一个富农担任编制册籍的工作，他想尽办法，拉拢落后农民，隐瞒产量，涂改数字，破坏粮食“三定”到户的工作。
    宜昌专区各县目前正在采取具体措施，整顿粮食“三定”的统计和册籍编制工作。宜都县八个区清洗了五名混进来的伪保长等坏分子。当阳县河溶区十八个乡训练了三百七十名统计人员，加强编制册籍的工作。远安县从县级机关中抽调五十五名工作人员，组成辅导组，分赴各区对册籍工作人员进行具体辅导。许多县还组成检查组，到各乡进行巡回检查。这些措施都是非常必要的。
    粮食“三定”册籍和统计工作混乱的现象，绝不只是宜昌专区特有的问题；在大多数粮食“三定”工作已经结束和即将结束的地区，都存在着这个问题。有些工作人员认为，把粮食“三定”数字合理地确定到户就完事了，于是放松了对于这些必要的技术工作的领导。但是，他们没有想到，如果对于册籍编制工作这样的“小事情”不加注意，那末，他们辛辛苦苦地调查研究、反复核算和发动群众民主评议而确定的“三定”数字，最后到了册籍工作人员的手里，就可能变成一堆糊涂账，甚至破坏了粮食“三定”工作的成果。过去两年的粮食统购统销工作中，所以发生了某些购销不合理的现象，主要原因之一，不正是国家粮食机关没有来得及掌握各地粮食生产、收购、供应、消费的基本情况吗？现在，我们已有可能在粮食“三定”的基础上整理出一套关于粮食生产、收购、供应、消费情况的统计资料。这些资料是今后做好粮食统购统销工作的一个极其重要的依据。有了它，今后的粮食工作就可以避免过去曾经发生过的一些缺点和错误。但是如果这些统计资料是不准确的，是经过篡改的，那就势必重复造成农村粮食统购统销的混乱现象，引起农民群众的不满。这样，也就谈不到粮食工作的制度化了。
    现在，不少地区还正在进行粮食“三定”到户的工作，这类地区的党委和政府应该及时采取有效措施，做好“三定”的统计和编制册籍的工作。那些已经完成粮食“三定”工作的地区，也应该对粮食“三定”册籍和数字资料进行必要的检查和整顿。
