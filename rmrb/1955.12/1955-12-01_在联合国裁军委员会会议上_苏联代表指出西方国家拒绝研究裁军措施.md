Xinhua News Agency, New York, dispatch from TASS The United Nations Disarmament Commission held meetings from the 23rd to the 25th to discuss the report of the Disarmament Subcommittee.

In his speech at the meeting on the 23rd, French representative Moch listed a series of disarmament measures that reduced the entire disarmament effort to merely limiting conventional armaments and supervising conventional armaments, completely ignoring the issue of banning atomic weapons. He also stated that he could not agree with the Soviet proposal that the major powers should undertake the obligation not to be the first to use atomic weapons.

Soviet representative Sobolev spoke at the meeting on the 24th. He pointed out that the Subcommittee had not completed the task entrusted to it by the United Nations General Assembly. He said that the Soviet Union had advocated in the past, and still advocates now, stopping the arms race, comprehensively reducing armaments and armed forces, banning nuclear weapons, and establishing practical international supervision. No agreement has been reached on some major issues of disarmament in the Subcommittee and at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The main obstacle in this regard is the attitude adopted by the United States. The US representative on the Subcommittee, on the pretext of technical difficulties in supervising atomic weapons, expressed doubts about the possibility of reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons. At the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the British and French governments also followed the US government, changing their previous attitude towards reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons. The attitude of the three countries shows that Western countries are refusing to study disarmament measures.

He also pointed out that the Western countries believe that it is currently impossible to implement a universal and broad disarmament plan, and suggest limiting the issue to establishing supervision and inspection without taking any measures to reduce armaments. This position has nothing in common with the desire to end the arms race.

Sobolev said that although the Disarmament Subcommittee has not yet made a unanimously agreed decision on the disarmament issue, this cannot affect our determination to continue our efforts to reach an agreement. Under the current circumstances, the Soviet Union attaches particular importance to making a decision on morally condemning the use of atomic weapons.

British representative Nutting, in his speech, attempted to shift the responsibility for the Subcommittee's failure to complete its task onto the Soviet Union, stubbornly claiming that the Soviet Union was unwilling to resolve the issue of supervision.

US representative Lodge said in his speech only that the United States could not agree with the Soviet representative's evaluation of the current US attitude on the disarmament issue. However, he did not offer any reasons to support his refutation of this evaluation.

The meeting concluded its discussion on the 25th and adopted a resolution deciding to submit the Subcommittee's report and the records of the Commission's meetings to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council for discussion.

    在联合国裁军委员会会议上
    苏联代表指出西方国家拒绝研究裁军措施
    新华社据塔斯社纽约讯　联合国裁军委员会二十三日到二十五日举行会议，讨论了裁军小组委员会的报告。
    法国代表莫克在二十三日会议发言中列举了一些裁军措施，这些措施把整个裁军工作只归结为限制常规军备和对常规军备实行监督，而完全忽视禁止原子武器的问题。他还表示不能够同意苏联关于大国应承担不首先使用原子武器的义务的建议。
    苏联代表索波列夫在二十四日会议上发言。他指出，小组委员会并没有完成联合国大会交托给它的任务。他说，苏联过去主张、现在仍然主张停止军备竞赛、全面裁减军备和武装部队、禁止核子武器和建立切实可行的国际监督。在小组委员会和在四国外交部长会议上都没有在裁军的一些重大问题上达成协议。这方面的主要障碍是美国所采取的态度。美国代表在小组委员会上借口在监督原子武器方面的技术困难，对裁减军备和禁止原子武器的可能性表示怀疑。在四国外交部长会议上，英法两国政府也追随美国政府，而改变了先前对裁减军备和禁止原子武器的态度。三国的态度表明，西方国家是拒绝研究裁军措施的。
    他并且指出，西方国家认为在目前不可能实行一个普遍的、广泛的裁军计划，并且建议把问题限制在建立监督和视察这方面而不采取任何裁减军备的措施，这种立场是同结束军备竞赛的愿望毫无共同之处的。
    索波列夫说，裁军小组委员会虽然还没有就裁军问题作出一致同意的决定，但是这并不能影响我们继续努力以求达成协议的决心。在目前的情况下，苏联特别重视就在道义上谴责使用原子武器作出决定。
    英国代表纳丁在发言中企图把小组委员会没有完成任务的责任推到苏联身上，他硬说苏联不愿意解决监督问题。
    美国代表洛奇在发言中仅仅说：美国不能同意苏联代表对美国目前在裁军问题上采取的态度的评价。但是他并没有提出任何理由来支持他对这种评价的反驳。
    会议在二十五日结束了讨论，并通过了一项决议，决定把小组委员会的报告和委员会各次会议的记录提交联合国大会和安全理事会讨论。
