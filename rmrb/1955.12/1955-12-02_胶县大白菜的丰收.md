	The Bumper Harvest of Jiaoxian Cabbage
	Xu Sijing
	In early winter, when people step into the gardens within Jiaoxian County, it is as if they have entered a green ocean. In the vegetable gardens, young women, while "tying the waists" of the rolled-up cabbages with straw ropes, joyfully praise this year's good cabbages. Young men carefully select the early-maturing cabbages, trim them into snow-white heads, pack them, and transport them away.

	This year's large-scale bumper harvest of cabbages in this area is unprecedented. Before liberation, Jiaoxian County as a whole planted less than two thousand mu of vegetables annually, with each mu producing only four thousand jin. By 1954, the vegetable planting area had expanded to five thousand mu, with each mu producing eight thousand jin. This year, with the support and guidance of the state, Jiaoxian County, together with some villages in the adjacent Jimo County, planted a total of 24,095 mu of cabbages, with an average yield of 9,377 jin per mu, exceeding the original plan by 20%. This year, not only is the yield high, but the quality of the cabbages is also good.

	This year, the state provided vegetable farmers with loans of 60,000 yuan, 720,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, 2,062,500 jin of bean cake, and 12,000 jin of pesticides. Furthermore, it provided much specific guidance and assistance in field management and cultivation techniques, which played a significant role in the bumper harvest. In implementing these measures, the organized farmers further demonstrated the superiority of collective strength, thus achieving an average yield increase of more than 10% compared to farmers outside the cooperative. Chengnan District in Jiaoxian County planted 2,900 mu of vegetables this year, with a total yield of over 29 million jin, an average increase of more than 50% per mu compared to last year. Among them, nearly a thousand mu of vegetable land in sixty agricultural cooperatives generally yielded 1,000 to 1,500 jin more per mu than farmers outside the cooperative. The Dongsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Sanlihe Township planted a total of twelve mu of vegetables, with an average yield of 14,500 jin per mu, more than double the yield per mu compared to last year when the cooperative was not yet organized.

	The farmers celebrate the bumper harvest and are even more grateful to the state for finding sales channels for the cabbages. This year, 60% of the total cabbage yield of over 200 million jin has already begun to be sold locally with the assistance of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, while the remaining 40% is directly purchased and transported to other areas by state economic departments.

    胶县大白菜的丰收
    徐思敬
    初冬季节，人们踏进胶县境内的园地时，就像进入了绿色的海洋。菜园里，年轻的姑娘们，一边用草绳给卷起的大白菜“扎腰”，一边欢乐地赞扬今年的好白菜。小伙子们，把选拔出来的一棵棵早熟白菜，修整得像雪白的菜球装好运走。
    今年这一带大白菜大面积的丰收是空前的。解放前胶县全县每年种菜不足两千亩，每亩只产四千斤。一九五四年种菜面积已扩大到五千亩，每亩产八千斤。今年在国家的扶持和指导下，胶县加上毗邻的即墨县的部分乡村，共种白菜两万四千零九十五亩，每亩平均产九千三百七十七斤，比原计划增产了二成。今年不仅产量高，菜的质量也好。
    今年国家对菜农贷款六万元、化学肥料七十二万斤、豆饼二百零六万二千五百斤、农药一万二千斤。并从田间管理和栽培技术上，给了许多具体的指导和帮助，这对丰收起了很大的作用。在实现这些措施中，组织起来的农民更显示了集体力量的优越性，因而取得了平均比社外农民增产一成多的丰收。胶县城南区，今年种菜两千九百亩，总产量两千九百多万斤，每亩平均比去年增产了成半多，其中六十处农业社近千亩菜地，普遍比社外农民每亩增产一千斤至一千五百斤。三里河乡东升农业社共种菜十二亩，每亩平均产菜一万四千五百斤，比未组织起合作社的去年每亩增产一倍多。
    农民们欢庆丰收，更感激国家给大白菜找到了销路。今年白菜总产量两亿多斤的百分之六十，已开始由基层供销社帮助菜农就地推销，其余百分之四十直接经国家经济部门收购调运外地。
