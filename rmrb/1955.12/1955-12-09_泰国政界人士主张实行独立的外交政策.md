Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, December 6th: Thai political figures continue to advocate that the Thai government should pursue an independent foreign policy.

Former Thai parliamentarian Nai Thongyoo stated at a mass rally in Bangkok on November 27th that Thailand should have its own independent foreign policy without being dominated by any country. He said that for the sake of Thailand's future, the government should give the domestic people full democratic rights as much as possible; abroad, it should try to open up diplomatic and trade relations with all countries.

Nai Khlai Naraphati, Secretary of the Thai Economist Party and a member of parliament, explained the Economist Party's foreign policy at a mass meeting attended by more than 10,000 people in Bangkok on November 26th, saying that the Economist Party advocates an independent foreign policy, upholds the principle of peaceful coexistence, and sympathizes with the struggle of all colonial countries for independence and freedom. Nai Khlai said that the Economist Party opposes the ruling authorities' one-sided and stubborn foreign policy, and advocates taking the neutral policies of India and Burma as examples.

The platform announced by the Social Democratic Party, newly established on November 24th and headed by Nai Suthep Sajjakul, also advocates that Thailand should establish friendly diplomatic and trade relations with countries around the world, regardless of their beliefs.

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok: According to newspaper reports, Thai statesman and former parliamentarian Nai Thongyoo said at a mass rally attended by nearly 20,000 people in Bangkok on November 13th that the Thai government should adopt an independent foreign policy, free from any constraints, and establish diplomatic and trade relations with any country with different systems in the world, especially with China. Nai Thongyoo asked: Why do we associate with distant European and American countries, but not with this country that is adjacent to Thailand?

Nai Thongyoo said that the United States' obstruction of Thailand's trade with China has caused losses to the Thai people. He believes that for the benefit of the Thai people's lives, direct trade relations should be established with China. Nai Thongyoo's speech aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    泰国政界人士主张实行独立的外交政策
    新华社六日讯　曼谷消息：泰国政界人士继续主张泰国政府应该实行独立的外交政策。
    泰国前议员乃通裕十一月二十七日在曼谷的一个群众集会上发言说，泰国应该有自己的独立的外交政策，而无需受任何国家的支配。他说，为了泰国的前途，政府应该尽量给予国内人民以充分的民主权利；在国外应该设法打开泰国同一切国家的外交关系和贸易关系。
    泰国经济人党秘书、议员乃克莱·纳拉拍蒂十一月二十六日在曼谷举行的有一万多人参加的群众大会上，解释经济人党的对外政策说，经济人党主张独立自主的外交政策，拥护和平共处的原则和同情一切殖民地国家争取独立自由的斗争。乃克莱说，经济人党反对执政当局对外政策的倒向一面和固执，而主张应该以印度和缅甸的中立政策为榜样。
    十一月二十四日新成立的以乃素贴·飒乍军为首的社会民主党所宣布的党纲，也主张泰国应该同世界上不论信仰任何主义的国家建立友好的邦交和贸易关系。
    据新华社讯　曼谷消息：据报纸报道，泰国老政治家、前议员乃通裕十一月十三日在曼谷举行的一个有近两万人参加的群众集会上说，泰国政府应当采取独立自主的外交政策，摆脱任何方面的束缚，而同世界上不同制度的任何国家，首先是同中国，建立外交关系和贸易关系。乃通裕问道：为什么我们同遥远的欧美国家结交，而不同这个与泰国毗邻的国家结交呢？
    乃通裕说，美国阻止泰国对中国进行贸易已经使泰国人民受到损失。他认为，为了泰国人民生活的利益，应该同中国建立直接的贸易关系。乃通裕的发言引起到会群众热烈的鼓掌。
