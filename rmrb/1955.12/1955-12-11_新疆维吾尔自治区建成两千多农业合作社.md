The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region had established 2,081 agricultural production cooperatives by November 25th, completing 57% of the plan to establish 3,659 cooperatives this winter and next spring. Over 52,000 peasant households have joined the cooperatives. The entire cooperative establishment work is expected to be completed before February next year.

Before and during the establishment of the cooperatives, all regions made relatively sufficient preparations. According to incomplete statistics, so far, the entire autonomous region has cultivated more than 6,600 year-round mutual aid teams that meet the requirements for establishing cooperatives, and approximately 59,000 peasant households have signed up to request to join cooperatives. Currently, the entire autonomous region has trained more than 25,000 key members for the cooperatives, and Party and Youth League building work has been carried out.

The first phase of agricultural production cooperative establishment work in southern Xinjiang for 1956 has basically concluded. This batch of newly established agricultural production cooperatives totals 1,796. The first phase of cooperative establishment work is generally healthy. For example, Shule County established 93 cooperatives in the first phase. Among them, poor peasant members accounted for 74% of the total members, and the main backbone members within the cooperatives were poor peasants, accounting for 70.52%, which not only established leadership with poor peasants as the core but also united middle peasants. During this period, many regions also led a batch of year-round mutual aid teams in preparing for the second phase of cooperative establishment. (Our correspondent in Urumqi)

    新疆维吾尔自治区建成两千多农业合作社
    新疆维吾尔自治区到十一月二十五日止，已经建成二千零八十一个农业生产合作社，完成了今年冬季和明年春季计划建社三千六百五十九个的百分之五十七。入社农户已有五万二千多户。整个建社工作可于明年二月以前全部结束。
    各地在建社前和建社中，都做了比较充分的准备工作，据不完全统计，到目前为止，全自治区已培养了具备建社条件的常年互助组六千六百多个，约有五万九千多农户报名请求转社。目前全自治区已经训练了二万五千多名社的骨干，并且进行了建党建团工作。
    南疆地区一九五六年度第一期建立农业生产合作社的工作已经基本结束。这批新建的农业生产合作社共有一千七百九十六个。第一期建社的工作，基本上是健康的。如疏勒县第一期建社九十三个。其中贫农社员占社员总数的百分之七十四，社内的主要骨干，贫农占百分之七十点五二，既树立了以贫农为核心的领导，并且团结了中农。这个期间，许多地区还领导一批常年互助组进行了第二期建社的准备工作。　（本报驻乌鲁木齐记者）
