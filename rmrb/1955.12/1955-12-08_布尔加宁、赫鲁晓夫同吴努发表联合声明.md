The Soviet side participating in the signing ceremony included: Gromyko, Kumykin, Rasulov, Rakhim Babayeva, Serov, and Soviet Ambassador to Burma, Syboldin.

The Burmese side participating included: Minister of Foreign Affairs Sao Khun Hkio, Minister of Industry and Mines U Kyaw Nyein, Minister of Defense U Ba Swe, Minister of Trade U Lwin, Minister of Home Affairs Bo Khin Maung Gale, Minister of Land Nationalization and Local Administration Democratization Tekin Tin, Minister of Information U Tun Win, Burmese Ambassador to the Soviet Union U Onh, and Prime Minister's Secretary U Than.

The full text of the joint statement is as follows:

At the invitation of the Government of the Union of Burma, Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Khrushchev, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, paid a friendly visit to the Union of Burma from December 1st to 7th, 1955. During their visit to Burma, Bulganin and Khrushchev held several talks with U Nu, Prime Minister of the Union of Burma. These talks were conducted in an atmosphere of extreme sincerity and complete mutual understanding, providing an opportunity for both sides to exchange views extensively on issues related to and beneficial to both countries, as well as on pressing issues of international significance.

During the aforementioned talks, it was reaffirmed that the consistently sincere and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the Union of Burma are now, and will continue to be, based on the solid principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence, and economic cooperation. The leaders of both countries believe that the increasingly widespread adoption of these principles of peaceful coexistence in the relations between all countries (regardless of size) will help consolidate peace and develop mutually beneficial cooperation between the peoples of all countries.

They expressed satisfaction that an increasing number of peace-loving countries and peoples recognize and adopt these principles, considering them conducive to promoting the interests of peace and the welfare of all peoples.

Both sides expressed their belief that the principles of peaceful coexistence open up broad vistas for cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Union of Burma in the economic, cultural, scientific and technical domains. They also expressed their determination to make every effort to develop and strengthen closer ties between the two countries in these areas, which will be in the interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and the Union of Burma, and will contribute to consolidating peace and stabilizing the international situation. To this end, the leaders of both countries agreed that representatives of the two countries will continue to negotiate on various issues in order to conclude specific agreements.

The desire and efforts of the peoples of the world to establish peace and friendly cooperation, especially the Bandung Conference held in April of this year, demonstrate that understanding and cooperation between countries are entirely feasible. The countries participating in the Bandung Conference have different political and social systems, but they are united by the common goal of further developing economic, cultural and political cooperation. This desire and effort created a favorable atmosphere for the success of the Geneva Four-Power Summit, which led to a significant relaxation of international tensions. Both sides fully agree that the relaxation of tensions that has been achieved should be consolidated, and measures should be taken to further ease international tensions. Politicians of both countries expressed the belief that although the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference did not reach a mutually agreed resolution on the issues raised in the instructions of the four heads of government, efforts should continue to be made to resolve these issues in the future for the sake of peace.

Politicians from the Soviet Union and the Union of Burma are deeply concerned about the expansion of armaments, especially the accumulation of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, the scale of which is expanding year by year. In order to eliminate fear, avoid the destruction of material wealth and the loss of countless lives, they believe that the manufacture, testing, and use of atomic and thermonuclear weapons should be unconditionally prohibited, conventional armaments should be drastically reduced, and effective international supervision should be established to monitor the implementation of these measures. They believe that it is essential to make resolute efforts to achieve these goals. They reiterated their unanimous opinion that the policy of establishing blocs should be condemned because it creates fear and distrust among the peoples of all countries. Only by implementing a policy of non-participation in these blocs can trust and goodwill be established between countries, thereby contributing to the cause of safeguarding peace and security. They believe that consolidating international peace and ensuring that the peoples of all countries have confidence in their future cannot be achieved by establishing blocs, but only through the common and collective efforts of the peoples of all countries.

The question of how to achieve a political settlement of the Indochina issue based on the resolutions of the Geneva Conference should be resolved without delay. The issue of the reunification of Korea, as well as the return of Taiwan and other islands, which have always belonged to China, to the People's Republic of China, should be resolved immediately in order to ease tensions and consolidate peace in the Far East. The resolution of these issues will contribute to the consolidation of international peace and security.

In order to enhance the prestige and role of the United Nations, the People's Republic of China should enjoy its legitimate status in this organization.

In order to achieve effective international cooperation to promote peace and progress, membership in the United Nations should be universal, and all countries that meet the conditions stipulated in the United Nations Charter should be allowed to participate in the United Nations. From this point of view, the Soviet government and the government of the Union of Burma support Canada's proposal in the United Nations to admit the eighteen countries that have already applied for membership.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and the Prime Minister of the Union of Burma believe that establishing personal contact and conducting negotiations between leaders is an effective way to strengthen mutual understanding and trust between the peoples of all countries. Such contact and negotiation will promote agreements and establish friendly relations between the peoples of all countries.

    布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫同吴努发表联合声明
    新华社七日讯　塔斯社仰光六日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫和缅甸联邦总理吴努的联合声明签字仪式，十二月六日在仰光举行。
    苏联方面参加签字仪式的有：葛罗米柯、库米金、拉苏洛夫、拉希姆巴巴耶娃、谢罗夫和苏联驻缅甸大使希鲍林。
    缅甸方面参加的有：外交部长藻昆卓、工业和矿务部长吴觉迎、国防部长吴巴瑞、贸易部长吴拉实、内政部长波庆貌格礼、土地国有化和地方行政民主化部长德钦阵、宣传部长吴顿温、缅甸驻苏联大使吴旺和总理秘书吴丹。
    联合声明全文如下：
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫应缅甸联邦政府的邀请在一九五五年十二月一日到七日在缅甸联邦作了友好访问。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在访问缅甸期间，同缅甸联邦总理吴努作了几次会谈。这些会谈是在极其诚恳和完全互相谅解的气氛中进行的，它们提供了机会使双方得以在与两国有关和对两国有利的问题上，以及在一些具有国际意义的迫切问题上，广泛地交换了意见。
    在上述会谈过程中已经重申：苏联同缅甸联邦之间一贯真挚和友好的关系现在是，将来也是以互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处和经济合作的巩固原则为基础的。两国领导人相信，在一切国家（不分大小）之间的关系上日益广泛地采用这些和平共处的原则，将有助于巩固和平和发展各国人民之间的有益的合作。
    他们表示满意的是：越来越多的爱好和平的国家和人民承认和采纳这些原则，认为这些原则可以增进和平的利益和各国人民的福利。
    双方表示相信，和平共处的原则为苏联和缅甸联邦两国在经济、文化、科学和技术方面的合作开辟了广阔的前途。双方还表示决心竭尽一切努力发展和加强两国在这些方面的更为密切的联系，这样做将符合苏联和缅甸联邦两国人民的利益，并且有助于巩固和平和国际局势的稳定。为此，两国领导人同意：两国的代表将就各种问题继续进行谈判，以便缔结具体的协定。
    世界各国人民争取建立和平和友好合作的愿望和努力，特别是今年四月举行的万隆会议，证明各国之间的了解和合作是完全可行的，参加万隆会议的国家具有不同的政治和社会制度，但是进一步发展经济、文化和政治合作的共同目标把它们团结起来。这种愿望和努力为日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的成功创造了有利的气氛，而日内瓦会议使得国际紧张局势有了显著的缓和。双方完全同意：已经争取到的紧张局势的缓和，应当加以巩固，并且应当采取措施进一步缓和国际紧张局势。两国政治家都表示了这样的信念：虽然日内瓦外交部长会议没有就四国政府首脑指示中所提出的问题达成一致同意的决议，但是，为了和平，今后还应该继续努力去解决这些问题。
    苏联和缅甸联邦的政治家感到十分关切的是扩充军备的情况，尤其是积累原子武器、氢武器和其他各种大规模毁灭性武器，而这种积累的规模正在逐年扩大。为了消除恐惧，避免物质财富遭到毁灭和无数人丧失生命，他们认为，应该无条件地禁止原子武器和热核子武器的制造、试验和使用，应该大大地裁减常规军备，应该建立有效的国际监督来监督这些措施的实施。他们认为，十分有必要作出坚决的努力来达到这些目的。他们重申这样一个一致的意见：建立集团的政策应该受到指责，因为它造成各国人民之间的恐惧和不信任，只有实行不参加这些集团的政策，才有助于建立各国之间的信任和善意，从而对保障和平和安全的事业作出贡献。他们相信，巩固国际和平和保证各国人民对他们的前途具有信心，不是用建立集团的办法所能做到的，只有各国人民进行共同的和集体的努力才能做到。
    如何根据日内瓦会议的决议使印度支那问题得到政治解决这个问题应当毫不拖延地加以解决。朝鲜统一的问题以及把历来属于中国的领土台湾和其他岛屿归还给中华人民共和国的问题都应当立刻加以解决，以便缓和紧张局势和巩固远东和平。这些问题的解决将有助于国际和平和安全的巩固。
    为了提高联合国的威信和作用，中华人民共和国应当在这个组织中享有它的合法的地位。
    为了达成有效的国际合作以促进和平和进步，联合国的会员国应当是普遍性的，所有符合联合国宪章规定的条件的国家，都应当被允许参加联合国。从这点出发，苏联政府和缅甸联邦政府支持加拿大在联合国提出的关于接纳已经申请加入的十八个国家的建议。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议主席、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员和缅甸联邦总理认为：领导人之间建立个人接触和进行谈判是加强各国人民之间的互相了解和信任的有效办法，这种接触和谈判将促使各国人民之间达成协议和建立起友好的关系。
