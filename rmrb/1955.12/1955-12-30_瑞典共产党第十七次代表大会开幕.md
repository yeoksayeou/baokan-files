Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, December 29th. According to TASS, the 17th Congress of the Communist Party of Sweden opened on December 28th in Solna, on the outskirts of Stockholm. Approximately 300 delegates are attending the congress. Foreign guests attending the congress include representatives from brotherly Communist and Workers' Parties from many European countries.

    Chairman of the Communist Party of Sweden, Hilding Hagberg, delivered a report to the congress.

    In his report, Hagberg first discussed the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism and the growth of the forces of peace and democracy after the Second World War. He then pointed out that there are still threats to Sweden's neutrality and that certain imperialist elements are attempting to eliminate Sweden's independence, making Sweden politically and economically dependent on American and British imperialism. The Swedish working class, leading the national patriotic forces, should raise the banner of the struggle to safeguard national freedom and peace. Peace defenders should continue to fight for the realization of a policy of coexistence and consultation, for the establishment of a European collective security system, for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and for peaceful trade and the normalization of all aspects of relations between countries.

    He pointed out that in Sweden and its neighboring countries, Denmark and Norway, the forces demanding a neutral course and withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are rapidly growing.

    Hagberg then spoke about some pressing domestic issues, including the further development of democracy, the struggle to increase wages, the unity of the working class, and the organizational strengthening of the Communist Party.

    Hagberg concluded by saying that the Communist Party of Sweden is an active force in national politics. Its positions and demands on vital issues receive the sympathy and support of the people. The key to the Party's future achievements lies in strengthening its ties with the masses.

    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩二十九日讯：瑞典共产党第十七次代表大会十二月二十八日在斯德哥尔摩城郊苏尔纳开幕。出席大会的约有三百名代表。参加大会的外国客人有欧洲许多国家的兄弟共产党和工人党代表。
    瑞典共产党主席哈格堡在大会上作报告。
    哈格堡在报告中首先谈到第二次世界大战后资本主义总危机的加深和和平民主力量的壮大。他接着指出目前还存在着对瑞典中立的威胁，某些帝国主义分子企图取消瑞典的独立，而使瑞典在政治上和经济上依附于美、英帝国主义。领导全国爱国力量的瑞典工人阶级应当举起维护国家自由和和平的斗争的大旗。和平保卫者应当继续斗争，争取实现共处和协商的政策、争取建立欧洲集体安全、争取裁军和禁止原子武器、争取和平贸易和各国之间各方面联系的正常化。
    他指出，在瑞典和瑞典的邻国丹麦和挪威，要求采取中立路线、退出北大西洋公约的力量在迅速增长。
    哈格堡接着谈到国内的一些迫切问题，谈到进一步发展民主，争取增加工资的斗争，工人阶级的团结，在组织上加强共产党等。
    哈格堡最后说，瑞典共产党是国家政治中的积极力量。它的立场和对切身重要问题的要求获得人民的同情和支持。党今后取得成就的关键在于加强同群众的联系。
