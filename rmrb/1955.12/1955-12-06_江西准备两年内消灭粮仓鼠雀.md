Jiangxi Prepares to Eliminate Rats and Sparrows from Granaries Within Two Years

    The Jiangxi Provincial Grain Department plans to eliminate rats and sparrows from thousands of grain warehouses in the next two years, and to make 90% of the province's granaries insect-free.

    This was planned at a recent conference on granary storage infrastructure convened by the Jiangxi Provincial Grain Bureau. The conference decided to launch a widespread rat and sparrow catching campaign among grain storage workers throughout the province this winter and next spring, to block rat holes, repair sparrow-proof nets, and eliminate sparrow nests. The conference also required all localities to conduct a general overhaul of granaries.

    Jiangxi Province currently has 1,132 rat-free and sparrow-free granaries. This year, grain warehouse staff across the province have already caught more than 280,000 rats and blocked many sparrow nests. The granaries in Guangfeng, Dayu and other counties have already become completely insect-free granaries, or mold-free granaries.

    江西准备两年内消灭粮仓鼠雀
    江西省粮食部门计划在今后两年内消灭几千个粮食仓库的老鼠和麻雀，并且使全省百分之九十的粮仓成为无虫粮仓。
    这是江西省粮食厅最近召开的仓储基本建设会议上规划的。这次会议决定今冬明春在全省粮食保管工作者中间，广泛开展捕鼠捕雀运动，堵塞鼠洞，装修防雀网，消灭雀窠。会议还要求各地普遍检修粮仓。
    江西省目前共有无鼠无雀粮仓一千一百三十二座。今年全省粮食仓库工作人员已经捕获了二十八万多头老鼠，堵塞了许多雀窠。广丰、大庾等县的粮仓已经全部成为无虫粮仓，或者是无霉粮仓。
