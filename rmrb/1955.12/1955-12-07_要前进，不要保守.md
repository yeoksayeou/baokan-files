    To Advance, Not Be Conservative
    Angang
    In the vast countryside, with the victorious conclusion of the autumn harvest, a great surge of paying patriotic grain, selling patriotic grain, and selling patriotic cotton is being stirred up. NanGong County in Hebei can purchase 700,000 jin of cotton per day, whereas in previous years it could only purchase 300,000 jin per day. The cotton purchased in LinCheng and BaiXiang counties has exceeded the original plan; BaiXiang, a small county with only 90,000 people, plans to purchase 6 million jin of seed cotton more than the quota this year.
    The enthusiasm of the broad masses in paying public grain vividly demonstrates the peasants' support for the Party's policies.
    The peasants are threshing and drying the best grain, filling sacks, and tying them to the cooperative's carts. Each cart has "three flowers and one flag," the grain delivery people wear flowers, the whips used to drive the livestock are adorned with flowers, and the livestock wear flowers on their heads; the red flags of "paying patriotic grain" flutter in the wind. The peasants regard paying public grain as a gift of gratitude to the Party and the state, and they are filled with the joy of a festival. The socialist enthusiasm of the peasants in paying public grain is causing grain work in many places to fall behind: some have not prepared the work well, and the peasants cannot put the grain they have prepared into the warehouse; others are following old methods, causing delays due to accounting.
    The upsurge of increased production in peasant cooperatives and the paying of public grain, selling of cotton, and selling of surplus grain are two aspects of the same thing. It concentrates the expression of the growth of peasants' socialist enthusiasm under the new situation of cooperativization. We should, as Chairman Mao instructed, "cherish any small socialist enthusiasm of the peasants and cadres, and should not frustrate it."
    Some people often only see the peasants' enthusiasm in production, and retain some old ideas and old work styles that are incompatible with real life in dealing with the grain issue.
    What are the manifestations of this old thinking and old work style?
    Some county and district staff are jubilant when talking about increased production, and this emotion is healthy, reflecting the actual situation. However, when it comes to the grain issue, as a responsible comrade of the Xingtai Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China said, "they always feel that their energy is not great." They want to set production on a reliable basis, and this motive is beyond reproach. However, the "reliable basis" in the minds of many comrades does not fully take into account the new situation of cooperativization and increased production, and therefore cannot but become a kind of conservative thinking. It is understood that many counties have the phenomenon of suppressing production figures. In Wuqing County, 120 of the 139 townships set production figures 20 percent lower than actual production. In individual counties, the production figures determined by the villages are reasonable, but the county is afraid of not being able to complete the task and being put in a passive position, so they "suppress" it. People say: the villages tell the truth, but the county doesn't let go. Some counties set production figures according to the highest annual output in 1952, which is very determined, but is still much lower than the actual output. The impact of this thinking has led to some abnormal phenomena in certain areas. Some cooperatives intentionally or unintentionally suppress and conceal production: some over-report the number of people and livestock, reporting grain crops as technical crops and high-yield crops as low-yield crops. In order to "suppress" production, some cooperatives adopt various erroneous practices, even setting up two sets of books, one for actual distribution and one for show.
    The reason for this unhealthy phenomenon is not that "the masses are backward." The masses' enthusiasm for patriotic production is high, and they actively pay grain and sell cotton according to regulations. Even if some of the masses show backwardness, it should be seen as a result of our lack of political education for the peasants. In these areas, the Party organizations, governments, and cooperative work in the townships and villages may have shortcomings. All old cooperatives with strong leadership have not experienced this problem. However, we cannot and should not over-criticize rural cadres. These phenomena mostly occur in new cooperatives, and the vast number of cadres have not yet had time to receive sufficient socialist ideological education, lack experience in their work, and are therefore prone to blindness. The main reason for these unhealthy phenomena is often due to conservative thinking at the county level. They are full of worries about grain work: afraid of encountering lean years in the future (without estimating the strengthening of national support and the ability to resist disasters after cooperativization), afraid of not completing the procurement task (but not estimating the growth of the peasants' socialist patriotic enthusiasm under the leadership of the Party), afraid that the higher authorities will reduce grain sales (without seriously calculating and finding reasonable sales figures). Endless "fears" make people only look backward and think from the bad side; and unable to look forward, conduct socialist education to the masses from the positive side, and lead the masses forward. This is the basis of conservative thinking.
    The best way to break this conservative thinking is to follow the spirit of Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," go deep into the masses to understand the situation, and actively calculate both the big picture and the detailed picture. On this basis, we can simultaneously deploy plans for this winter, next year, and the long-term construction.
    Baixiang County in Hebei Province is a "safe land" that is not afraid of drought or flood. Cotton fields account for more than one-third of the total cultivated land in the county, and grain fields account for about two-thirds. The county's total grain purchase task is 9.9 million jin, and the county-level leading organs once believed that "the total purchase target is large" and blindly emphasized that there were "difficulties" in completing the task. The staff of the Xingtai Prefectural Commissioner's Office helped solve this problem by using the method of calculating the big picture. Baixiang County's grain output this year is 47.44 million jin, an increase of 9.17 million jin over 1954; the total purchase task this year is 9.9 million jin, a decrease of 440,000 jin from 1954; the total sales task this year is 5.15 million jin, a decrease of 2.48 million jin from 1954. After deducting actual sales from actual production this year, the county's surplus grain is 3.75 million jin. This proves that the statement emphasizing difficulties is completely unfounded.
    Ningjin County is a grain-producing area with a dense population and little land, high cultivation technology, and great production potential. In the past, this county was a grain-deficient county and needed to import grain from outside. This year, the county stipulated that 5 million jin of grain should be purchased in the autumn and 10 million jin of grain should be sold. The prefectural committee disagreed with this figure and proposed to purchase 9 million jin, and also made reasonable reductions in sales. The comrades in the county said: we can find loopholes to complete the sales plan, but the purchase task cannot be completed. Later, it was proposed that: we can find loopholes in the purchase to complete 2 million jin more, and the remaining 2 million jin cannot be completed. The staff of the prefectural committee and the commissioner's office who inspected the work went deep into some villages to investigate and study, and presented some typical survey figures to the county.
    The situation of Xinningtun they investigated is as follows: this small village has a total of 19 households, 108 people, 8 draught animals, and 4 pigs, and cultivates a total of 160 mu of grain crops, averaging 1.481 mu per person, with a fixed output of 21,149 jin, an average yield of 132 jin per mu. After investigation and research, and after carrying out patriotic education to the peasants, these 19 households reported an output of 28,065 jin, with a yield of 175.6 jin per mu. Jiang Zhaojin's family of three cultivated 3.89 mu of grain fields, with a fixed output of 277 jin and a self-reported output of 677 jin.
    It can be seen from this material that: in a small village of 19 households, the number reported by the masses differs from the number set by the county by 6,916 jin! This phenomenon is relatively common, thus confirming the existence of conservative thinking. Therefore, the comrades in the county finally said: "We will definitely be able to complete the state's purchase plan." The leading thinking in Ningjin County began a new transformation, from emphasizing difficulties to tapping potential, overcoming difficulties, and transforming from a grain-deficient county to a self-sufficient county.
    Conservative thinking is a stumbling block in work, making people timid and afraid to boldly raise and solve problems. For example, cotton-producing areas have always relied on state supply of grain. This supply is completely reasonable, but individual areas have been burdened with the package of "relying on external supply," ignoring the possibility of increasing grain crop production in the region, and have not taken more measures to improve the unit area yield of grain production.
    Shahe County is a place with "mountains but no forests, rivers but no water," "nine droughts in ten years," and "more droughts, more winds, and more rain when water is not needed." In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, it has gradually conquered disasters and cultivated cotton in large quantities. It has now become a cotton-producing area. Although Shahe suffered a disaster this year, farmland still increased production. Cotton fields increased production by 5 jin per mu, and millet exceeded the planned output by 15 jin. The county originally set an average yield of 115 jin per mu, but the actual yield was more than 133 jin. Everyone made a comprehensive plan for the work of the county at the Party Congress. Everyone reviewed and said: In the past, we thought that our county had expanded 100,000 mu of cotton fields and 100,000 mu of oil crops, and the technical crops had expanded, so the state would have to supply grain; now it seems that this is conservative thinking. Why? Our eyes only look upward, reaching out for grain, we did not look downward. Looking down, in addition to the road of state supply of grain, there are many ways to increase grain production.
    After the comrades in Shahe County criticized conservative thinking, their eyes lit up. What did they see when they looked down?
    They saw: A small cooperative in Luoyang Village planted 8 mu of wheat. After harvesting the wheat, they planted watermelons. After pulling out the watermelons, they planted Chinese cabbage. Wheat was left in the Chinese cabbage field. People call this method "upstairs, downstairs." Of course, we cannot plant watermelons on all the land, but this spirit and method of fully utilizing the land, implementing multiple cropping, and improving labor productivity opens a path for increased production.
    In Liuquzhuang, they discovered a 10,000-mu wasteland, which was a no-man's zone created by the enemy in the past. In the era of small-scale peasant economy, people did not have the strength to calculate its value. Now, people are immigrating here, and tractors will soon drive over. Soon, it will become a granary in Shahe County. People have also found many small plots of wasteland, Yaozhuang in the second district found 1,000 mu, the fifth district found 6,000 mu, and Beizu Village found 40 mu, all good land. People said: Once the thinking changes, the land is there.
    The Shahe County Party Committee has criticized conservative thinking and is solving the grain problem with great courage. They have put forward a bold but completely realistic indicator: this year is the last year that grain will be supplied by the state, next year they will achieve self-sufficiency, and the year after next they will sell 5 million jin of surplus grain to the state. Such things were unimaginable in the past, but today, with the development of the cooperative movement, yesterday's ideals have become today's reality.
    In many areas, grain work is developing slower than the cooperative movement. Some places adopt very complicated methods to close the door and do accounting, preventing grain work from meeting with the masses and combining with the socialist enthusiasm of the masses, which has a lot to do with conservative thinking. People with conservative thinking cannot see the strength of the Party and the masses, and cannot see that the grain front is a socialist front, with a fierce struggle between two lines, just like the cooperative movement and the production movement. These comrades do not understand that adopting a conservative attitude in grain work will inevitably lead to abandoning leadership over the masses, frustrating the peasants' socialist enthusiasm for loving the country, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and developing production, undermining the superiority of increased production in agricultural production cooperatives, and thus affecting next year's production. The logic of life points us to the fact that if we want to move forward, we must abandon conservative thinking. As long as we strengthen leadership, cherish the socialist enthusiasm of the masses for paying public grain, selling surplus grain, and selling cotton, and make it a driving force for promoting increased production, we will definitely be able to change the status quo and take a big step forward.

    要前进，不要保守
    安岗
    在广大农村中，随着秋季收获的胜利结束，一个缴爱国粮，卖爱国粮，卖爱国棉的大浪潮正在掀起。河北南宫县一天能收购七十万斤棉花，而在往年一天只能收三十万斤。临城、柏乡两县收购棉花突破原来的计划；柏乡这一个只有九万人口的小县，今年准备超额多购六百万斤籽棉。
    广大群众缴公粮的热情生动地证明了农民对党的政策的拥护。
    农民把最好的谷子打好，晒好，装满口袋，绑在合作社的大车上。每辆车都有“三花，一旗”，送粮人戴花，赶牲口的鞭子上插花，牲口头上挂花；“缴爱国粮”的红旗迎风招展。农民把缴公粮当作对党和国家感谢的献礼，他们充满节日的喜悦心情。农民缴公粮的这种社会主义积极性，使得很多地方的粮食工作跟不上：有的是准备工作没作好，农民弄好公粮入不了库；有的是因袭老办法，让算账给耽误了时间。
    农民合作增产和缴公粮、卖棉花、卖余粮的热潮，正是一件事物的两个方面。它集中地表现了在合作化新形势下农民社会主义积极性的增长。我们应该像毛主席指示的那样：“应当爱惜农民和干部的任何一点微小的社会主义积极性，而不应当去挫折它。”
    有些人常常只是看到农民生产方面的积极性，而在对待粮食问题上保留了若干同现实生活不相适应的旧思想和旧作风。
    什么是这种旧思想旧作风的表现呢？
    有些县区工作人员谈增产是兴高采烈，这种情绪是健康的，它反映了实际情况。可是一谈到粮食问题，这正如中共邢台地委一位负责同志说的：“总感觉劲头不大”。他们想把产量订在可靠的基础上，这个动机是无可非议的。但是，不少同志心目中的“可靠基础”没有对合作化和增产的新情况作充分的估计，因而也就不能不成为一种保守思想。据了解，有不少的县有压低产量的现象。武清县一百三十九个乡，有一百二十个乡定产的产量比实产量低百分之二十。个别县的村确定的产量合理，县里怕完不成任务，造成被动，就来“压低”。人们说：村里说实话，县里不放手。有的县按照一九五二年最高年产量定产，决心很大，可是还是比实际产量低许多。这种思想影响所及，在某些地区出现了一些不正常的现象。若干合作社有意无意地压低和隐瞒产量：有的多报人数和牲口头数，把粮食作物报成技术作物，高产作物报成低产作物。为着“压低”产量，有些合作社采用种种错误作法，甚至设两本账，一本作实分用，一本应付门面。
    产生这种不健康现象的原因，不是“群众落后”。群众的爱国生产的积极性是高涨的，他们按照规定踊跃缴粮、卖棉。即使部分群众中有落后的表现，也应该看作是我们对农民缺乏政治教育的结果。在这些地区，乡和村的党组织、政府和合作社工作中可能是有缺点的。所有的有坚强领导的老社都没有发生这种毛病。但是，我们不能也不应当过多地指责乡村干部。这些现象大部分发生在新社，广大干部还没有来得及接受充分的社会主义的思想教育，工作没有经验，有时也就容易犯盲目性的毛病。产生这些不健康现象的主要原因常常是由于县一级的领导有保守思想。他们对粮食工作顾虑重重：怕将来遇歉年（没有估计全国的支援和合作化后抵抗灾害力量的加强），怕完不成收购任务（但没有估计到农民在党领导下社会主义的爱国热情的增长），怕上级减少粮食销量（没有认真精打细算找到合理的销售数字）。无穷无尽地“怕”，使人只能往后看，从坏处想；而不能向前看，从积极方面向群众进行社会主义教育，带领群众前进。这是保守思想的基础。
    打破这种保守思想的最好方法是遵照毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告的精神，深入群众了解情况，积极地算大账和细账。在这一基础上可以同时部署今冬、明年以及长远的建设计划。
    河北省柏乡县是一块不怕旱也不怕涝的“保险地”，全县棉田占全部耕地的三分之一强，粮田约占三分之二。全县粮食统购任务是九百九十万斤，县级领导机关曾认为“统购指标大”，盲目强调完成任务有“困难”。邢台专署的工作人员用算大账的方法帮助解决了这个问题。柏乡县今年粮食产量为四千七百四十四万斤，比一九五四年增产九百一十七万斤；今年统购任务是九百九十万斤，比一九五四年减少四十四万斤；今年统销任务为五百一十五万斤，比一九五四年减少二百四十八万斤。今年实产除去实销，全县余粮数目是三百七十五万斤。由此证明，那种强调困难的说法是完全没有根据的。
    宁晋县是一个产粮区，人稠地窄，耕作技术高，生产潜力大。历年来，这个县是缺粮县，需要从外边调进粮食。今年县里规定秋季征购五百万斤粮食，销售一千万斤粮食。地委不同意这个数字，提出征购九百万斤，销售方面也作了合理的减缩。县里同志说：我们找漏洞，可以完成销售计划，征购任务完不成。以后提出：征购方面找漏洞，可以多完成二百万斤，剩下的二百万斤完不成。地委和专署检查工作的人员深入到一些村庄去调查研究，向县里提出了一些典型调查的数字。
    他们调查的新宁屯的情况如下：这个小村共有十九户，一百零八人，八头耕畜，四只猪，共种一百六十亩粮食作物，每人平均一亩四分八厘一，定产为二万一千一百四十九斤，平均亩产一百三十二斤。经过调查研究，并且向农民进行爱国主义教育，这十九户自报产量二万八千零六十五斤，亩产一百七十五斤六两。姜召进家三口人，种粮田三亩八分九厘，定产二百七十七斤，自报产量六百七十七斤。
    从这个材料中可以看到：一个十九户的小村庄，群众自报数同县里定产数就相差六千九百一十六斤！这种现象比较普遍，因而也就证实了保守思想的存在。所以，最后县里同志表示：“我们一定能够完成国家的征购计划”。宁晋县的领导思想开始了一个新的转变，从强调困难变为挖掘潜力，战胜困难，从缺粮县一变而为自足县。
    保守思想是工作中的绊脚石，它使人畏首畏尾，不敢大胆提出问题和解决问题。例如产棉区历年来都是靠国家供应粮食的。这种供应是完全合理的，但是个别地区背上了“靠外边供应”的包袱，忽视了本地区的粮食作物增产的可能性，没有采取更多的办法来提高粮食生产的单位面积产量。
    沙河县是一个“有山没有林，有河没有水”、“十年九旱”、“旱多，风多，不用水的时候雨多”的地方。几年来，它在党的领导下，逐步征服灾害，大量种植棉花。现在已经成了一个产棉区。今年沙河虽然受了灾，农田还是增了产。棉田每亩增产五斤，谷子超过预定产量十五斤。全县原定每亩平均产量一百一十五斤，实收一百三十三斤多。大家在党代表会议上对全县工作做了全面的规划。大家检讨说：过去认为我们县扩大了十万亩棉田，十万亩油料，技术作物扩大了，国家就得供应粮食；现在看来，这是保守思想。为什么呢？我们的眼睛只向上看，伸手要粮食，我们没有往下看。往下看，除了国家供应粮食这条路外，还有许许多多增产粮食的门路。
    沙河县的同志们批判保守思想后，眼睛亮了。他们往下看，看到了些什么呢？
    他们看到：洛阳村一个小社，种了八亩麦子。收了麦子种上西瓜。拔了西瓜又种上白菜。白菜地里又留下麦子。人们管这种方法称作“楼上楼”。当然，我们不可能使所有土地都种上西瓜，但是这种充分利用土地，实行复播，提高劳动生产率的精神和方法，却给增产打开一个门径。
    他们在刘雀庄发现了一片万亩的荒地，这些土地是过去敌人造成的无人区。小农经济时代，人们没有力量去打它的算盘。现在，正在向这里移民，拖拉机就要开过去。不久，它将成为沙河县的一个谷仓。人们还找到许多小块荒地，二区姚庄找到一千亩，五区找到六千亩，北俎村找到四十亩，都是好地，人们说：思想一改变，地就有了。
    沙河县委批判了保守思想，正以极大的勇气来解决粮食问题。他们提出了一个大胆的但是完全现实的指标：今年是由国家供应粮食的最后一年，明年实行自给，后年卖给国家五百万斤余粮。像这样的事情过去连想也不敢想，而在今天，随着合作化运动的发展，昨天的理想成了今天的现实。
    有不少地区，粮食工作比合作化运动发展得慢一些。有些地方采用十分繁琐的办法关门算账，不能让粮食工作同群众见面，同群众的社会主义积极性结合，这同保守思想大有关系。有保守思想的人看不见党和群众的力量，看不见粮食战线是社会主义的一条战线，跟合作化运动、生产运动一样，有激烈的两条路线的斗争。这些同志不了解，在粮食工作上采取保守态度，就必然会放弃对群众的领导，挫折农民爱国家、巩固工农联盟、发展生产的社会主义积极性，使农业生产合作社增产的优越性受到损害，从而影响明年的生产。生活的逻辑指给我们，要前进，就得抛弃保守思想。只要加强领导，珍贵群众缴公粮、卖余粮、卖棉花的社会主义热情，并使之成为推动增产的动力，那就一定能转变现状，向前迈一大步。
