    Learn from the Example of Advanced Producers and Strive to Better Complete the Annual Plan
    The year 1955 is coming to an end in one month. On the industrial production and capital construction fronts, good news of advanced workers completing or comprehensively completing the national plan for the year ahead of schedule is constantly pouring in. Many advanced workers, such as those at the Qishuyan, Changxindian, Shenyang Huangguantun, and Shijiazhuang four locomotive and rolling stock repair factories, and more than 500 workers in the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory and Shanghai Motor Factory, have begun to do the workload for 1956. Among them, Wang Xinnian, a lathe operator at the Shijiazhuang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, is already doing the work for September 1957; Zhang Jinming, a young lathe operator at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, is already doing the work for June 1956. In the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, Sheng Li, a lathe operator who won the title of labor model, and Hu Senrong, a young scraper, have completed the workload of the Five-Year Plan in late November. Zhang Axi, a worker at the Shanghai Xinzhong Power Machinery Factory, has also completed the workload of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Many technicians have also played a very important role in completing and comprehensively completing the national plan ahead of schedule. For example, Wang Caichu, a technician in the zinc electrolysis workshop of the Shenyang Smelter, in the increase production and practice economy campaign that began in mid-July, in order to effectively improve the casting yield, he went deep into the work section to observe the operations of workers in each shift, and used the Kovalev work method to sum up an advanced operation method from the operating experience of dozens of furnaces. After the workers in each shift promoted this experience, the casting yield rate reached more than 97%, thus reversing the situation of failing to complete the national plan target (97%) for a long time. These vivid facts tell us that the socialist enthusiasm of the working masses and technicians is rising day by day, and more and more workers and technicians are taking a conscious communist attitude to labor, striving to complete and overfulfill this year's national plan.
    However, the number of workers who, like the many advanced producers mentioned above, work with a conscious sense of ownership, thereby completing the national plan ahead of schedule, is not yet the majority. Many workers are still not completing the plan well enough. Some people have completed the production plan, but the product quality is not good; some people have completed the production and quality plans, but have not completed the savings plan; some people have not even completed the production plan. The national plan depends on every worker to complete it. If many workers in a workshop cannot comprehensively complete their individual plans, the plan of the entire workshop cannot be comprehensively completed. If the workshop cannot complete the plan, the entire enterprise cannot comprehensively complete the national plan. Therefore, every worker must not think that failing to complete the plan is a personal matter. This is a major matter related to the entire national construction. Therefore, in the coming month, redoubling efforts to comprehensively and overfulfill the national plan for this year remains the most important and urgent task of the working masses in all enterprises.
    A very important part of comprehensively completing and overfulfilling the annual plan lies in the further development of the initiative and creativity of our working masses. Because the working masses are the most direct and concrete executors of the national plan. If all workers can consciously implement the measures proposed by the leadership and actively put forward rationalization proposals, consciously abide by various rules and regulations, and learn and promote advanced experiences, then labor efficiency can be rapidly improved, and the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of the national plan will have a reliable foundation. Therefore, every worker should strive to learn from the example of advanced producers, and fully develop their conscious labor enthusiasm in the implementation of the first five-year plan and the annual plan.
    To develop initiative and creativity in production, the most important thing is to treat our work with a conscious sense of ownership, that is, a communist labor attitude. As everyone knows, the working class is now the leading class of the country, and the personal interests of every worker are completely consistent with the interests of the country. The greater the value we create in labor and the better the plan is completed, the faster the socialist economy will develop, and the better the material and cultural life of the working class will be. Therefore, we must consciously overcome all difficulties in production, abide by labor discipline and operating procedures, consciously learn advanced technologies and advanced experiences, practice thrift, oppose waste, and strive to create higher labor productivity. We already have many such advanced producers. He Defa, a fitter and Communist Party member at the Hangzhou General Machinery Factory, is one of them. Before studying the general task of the country during the transition period, he regarded the daily eight-hour production as a "routine" and always hoped that these eight hours would pass quickly, so he was not very enthusiastic about production. After studying the general task of the country during the transition period, he realized that daily production was not a "routine" but was for building socialism, and realized that if every worker could complete the monthly plan a few days earlier and complete the annual plan a month earlier, the happy life of socialism could come sooner. Therefore, he actively learned advanced technologies, took the initiative to ask experienced people for advice, improved operating methods, and checked tools, drawings, and materials before work every day, preparing everything he needed, and worked continuously in production, not wasting a minute, thus improving production efficiency twofold. As a result, on October 15 this year, he had comprehensively completed the entire plan for 1955 and started working on 1956. If every worker, like He Defa, treats work with a conscious sense of ownership, then it can be guaranteed that the national plan will be comprehensively completed and overfulfilled.
    At present, earnestly promoting advanced experiences is the most effective method to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the national plan. For example, if all steelmaking workers in the country can promote the fast steelmaking experience of Kolesnikov, an excellent Soviet steelmaking worker, the annual steel output of our country can be increased by 25% without adding any equipment. Sheng Li, a lathe operator at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, after completing the workload of four years and six and a half months in the five-year plan in August this year, learned the tool experience of Fedorov, an excellent Soviet lathe operator, and was able to increase the cutting speed of each minute from 367 meters to 550 meters, thereby completing 48 days of workload in one month and ensuring the quality of the products. The workers of the Meng Xiangong youth drilling team of the 115 team of the North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau earnestly promoted advanced experiences such as coal alkali mud and oil pressure indicators in labor competitions, increased the pure drilling time, thereby completing the national plan 104 days ahead of schedule. After the coal mining team led by Cui Chengfu of the Hegang Xin No. 1 Mine implemented the experience of the comprehensive coal mining work team, the average coal mining volume per person per shift increased from more than two tons to more than five tons, and the production cost was greatly reduced. Before the first quarter, the Shenyang Wire Rod Factory wasted a lot of coal and steel; however, from the second quarter onwards, due to the fact that all employees earnestly promoted the advanced experience of cost accounting by work teams in labor competitions, by mid-August, the entire factory had saved 256 tons of steel and 437 tons of coal, thereby comprehensively completing the national plan. These effective advanced experiences exist in any industry. As long as every worker and technician can earnestly promote these advanced experiences according to the specific needs of production, we will surely be able to strive to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the national plan.
    In the past two years, the working class of our country has made great efforts and achieved great achievements in completing the national plan. If we can better complete the national plan this year, it will create favorable conditions for comprehensively completing and overfulfilling the first five-year plan.

    学习先进生产者的榜样  争取更好地完成年度计划
    一九五五年还有一个月就要结束了。工业生产和基本建设战线上不断传来先进工人提前完成、全面完成本年度国家计划的捷音。许多先进的工人们，如戚墅堰、长辛店、沈阳皇姑屯和石家庄四个机车车辆修理工厂和上海机床厂、上海电机厂等五个工厂中就有五百多个工人开始做一九五六年的工作量了。其中如石家庄机车车辆修理工厂车工王新年，已经做一九五七年九月份的工作；长辛店机车车辆修理工厂青年车工张金铭，已经做一九五六年六月份的工作了。在上海机床厂里，荣获劳动模范称号的车工盛利、青年刮工胡森荣等，都分别于十一月下旬提前完成了五年计划的工作量。上海新中动力机器厂工人章阿锡，也已经提前完成了五年计划的工作量。许多技术人员在提前完成和全面完成国家计划中也发挥了很重要的作用。如沈阳冶炼厂锌电解车间技术员王才楚，在七月中旬以后开始的增产节约运动中，为了切实提高铸型实收率，深入工段观察各班工人操作，运用郭瓦廖夫工作方法，从数十炉的操作经验中，总结出一种先进操作方法来。各班工人推广这个经验以后，铸型实收率都达到百分之九十七以上，从而扭转了长期完不成国家计划指标（百分之九十七）的情况。这些活生生的事实告诉我们，工人群众和技术人员的社会主义积极性正日益高涨，越来越多的工人和技术人员都采取了自觉的共产主义的态度进行劳动，争取完成和超额完成今年的国家计划。
    但是，像上面所说的许多先进生产者用自觉的主人翁态度进行劳动，从而提前完成国家计划的工人还不是多数。不少工人完成计划的情况还是不够好的。有的人虽然完成了产量计划，但是产品质量不好；有的人虽然完成了产量、质量计划，但是没有完成节约计划；有的人甚至连产量计划也没有完成。国家计划是靠每一个工人来完成的。在一个车间里，有许多工人不能全面完成个人计划，整个车间的计划就不能全面完成。车间不能完成计划，整个企业就不能全面完成国家计划。所以，每一个工人绝不能以为完不成计划是一个人的事。这是关系整个国家建设的大事。因此，在今后的一个月内加倍努力，争取全面地和超额地完成本年度的国家计划，仍然是一切企业中工人群众的最重要、最迫切的任务。
    全面完成和超额完成年度计划，很重要的一环在于我们工人群众进一步发挥积极性和创造性。因为工人群众是国家计划最直接最具体的执行者。如果全体工人都能够自觉地执行领导方面所提出的措施并积极提出合理化建议，自觉地遵守各种规章制度，学习和推广先进经验，那末，劳动效率就能迅速提高，全面完成和超额完成国家计划就有了可靠的基础。因此每一个工人都应该努力学习先进生产者的榜样，在执行第一个五年计划和年度计划中都要充分发挥自觉的劳动积极性。
    我们要在生产中发挥积极性和创造性，最要紧的是以自觉的主人翁也就是共产主义的劳动态度来对待自己的工作。大家都知道，现在工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，每一个工人的个人利益和国家的利益是完全一致的。我们在劳动中创造的价值越大，计划完成得越好，社会主义经济就越迅速发展，工人阶级的物质生活和文化生活也就越过越好。因此，我们必须自觉地克服生产上的一切困难，遵守劳动纪律和工艺规程，自觉地学习先进技术和先进经验，厉行节约、反对浪费，为创造更高的劳动生产率而努力。我们已经有了许多这样的先进生产者。国营杭州通用机器厂钳工、共产党员何德法就是一个。他在学习国家在过渡时期的总任务以前，把每天八小时的生产看作“例行公事”，干活时总盼望这八小时赶快过去，因而生产的劲头不大。学习了国家在过渡时期的总任务以后，他认识到每天生产不是“例行公事”，而是为了建设社会主义，认识到如果每一个工人都能提前几天完成月计划，提前一月完成年度计划，社会主义的幸福生活就可以早一些到来。于是，他就积极学习先进技术，主动地请教有经验的人，改进操作方法，并且每天在上班前，先检查工具，检查图纸，检查材料，把所用的一切东西都准备好，在生产中不间断地工作，不浪费一分钟，因而提高了生产效率两倍。结果，在今年十月十五日，他已经全面地完成了一九五五年的全部计划，开始作一九五六年的工作了。如果每一个工人都像何德法一样，用自觉的主人翁态度来对待工作，那末，就可以保证全面完成和超额完成国家计划。
    在目前，认真推广先进经验是全面完成和超额完成国家计划的最有效方法。例如，全国炼钢工人如果都能够推广苏联优秀炼钢工人科列斯尼科夫的快速炼钢经验，我国钢的年产量就可以在不增加任何设备的情况下增加百分之二十五。上海机床厂车工盛利，在今年八月完成了五年计划中的四年六个半月的工作量以后，又学习苏联优秀车工费奥多罗夫的车刀经验，就能使每一分钟的切削速度由三百六十七公尺提高到五百五十公尺，从而在一个月内完成四十八天的工作量，并且保证了产品的质量。华北煤田地质勘探局一一五队孟宪功青年钻机小组的工人们，在劳动竞赛中认真推广煤碱泥浆和油压指示器等先进经验，增加了纯钻进时间，从而提前了一百零四天全面完成国家计划。鹤岗新一矿崔成福所领导的采煤队，推行了综合采煤工作队的经验以后，平均每人每班的采煤量就由二吨多提高到五吨多，生产成本大大降低。沈阳线材厂在第一季度以前，煤和钢材的浪费很大；但是，从第二季度起，由于全体职工在劳动竞赛中认真推行班组节约核算的先进经验，到八月中旬，全厂就节约了二百五十六吨钢材和四百三十七吨煤，从而全面地完成国家计划。这些行之有效的先进经验，在任何一个产业里都有。只要每一个工人和技术人员都能根据生产的具体需要，认真推广这些先进经验，我们就一定能够争取全面完成和超额完成国家计划。
    我国工人阶级在过去两年中都为完成国家计划作了很大努力，取得了很大成就，如果今年能更好地完成国家计划，那末，就能给全面完成和提前完成第一个五年计划创造有利的条件。
