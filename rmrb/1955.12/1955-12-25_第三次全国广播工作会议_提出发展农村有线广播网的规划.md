    Xinhua News Agency, December 24th. The Third National Broadcasting Work Conference, recently held in Beijing, proposed that in 1956, the country will add more than 900 wired broadcasting stations with 450,000 to 500,000 loudspeakers, of which 80 percent will be located in rural areas. By the end of 1957, there will be more than 1,800 broadcasting stations and more than 1,360,000 loudspeakers in rural areas nationwide. Some provinces will reach the point where every village and cooperative can hear broadcasts. By 1962, there will be more than 5,400 wired broadcasting stations in rural areas nationwide, with more than 6,700,000 loudspeakers. All villages, agricultural production cooperatives, and some farmer households across the country will have the tools to listen to broadcasts and can regularly hear broadcasts from Beijing and their own province and county.
    To realize the above plan, the conference determined that in developing rural broadcasting networks, we should adopt the policy of "relying on the masses, utilizing existing equipment, developing in stages, gradually standardizing, and reaching villages and cooperatives first, then courtyards and households." The conference also discussed issues such as the leadership, funding, and programs of rural wired broadcasting stations, as well as the division of labor with postal and telecommunications departments, and exchanged experiences in establishing rural wired broadcasting stations in various regions.
    This conference, held from the 15th to the 22nd, was hosted by the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau. It was attended by the directors of 54 provincial (municipal) and autonomous region people's broadcasting stations, and the responsible persons of wired broadcasting stations in cities such as Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Siping, Suzhou, and Nantong. On the first day of the conference, Mei Yi, Director of the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau, gave a report on "The Principles, Plans, and National Broadcasting Development Plan for Developing Rural Broadcasting." On the 23rd, the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau also invited the directors of People's Broadcasting Stations in relevant regions to hold a symposium on broadcasting work in minority areas, exchanging views on the development of broadcasting in minority areas.

    第三次全国广播工作会议
    提出发展农村有线广播网的规划
    新华社二十四日讯　最近在北京召开的第三次全国广播工作会议提出：一九五六年全国将增加有线广播站九百多个，带有喇叭四十五万到五十万个，其中百分之八十将设在农村。到一九五七年底，全国农村将有一千八百多个广播站，一百三十六万多个喇叭。有的省份将达到村村、社社都可以听到广播。一九六二年全国农村有线广播站将达到五千四百多个，带有喇叭六百七十多万个，全国所有的村庄、农业生产合作社和一部分农民家庭，都有了收听广播的工具，可以经常听到北京和本省、本县的广播。
    为实现以上计划，会议确定在发展农村广播网时，应当采取“依靠群众，利用现有设备，分期发展，逐步正规，先到村社，后到院户”的方针。会议还对农村有线广播站的领导、经费、节目以及和邮电部门的分工等问题进行了讨论，并且交流了各地建立农村有线广播站的经验。
    这次会议，在十五日到二十二日举行，由广播事业局主持，有五十四个省（市）、自治区和省辖市人民广播电台台长，和张家口、承德、四平、苏州、南通等城市有线广播站的负责人员参加。会议第一天，由广播事业局局长梅益作了“关于发展农村广播的方针、规划和全国广播事业发展计划”的报告。二十三日，广播事业局还邀请有关地区的人民广播电台台长举行少数民族地区广播工作座谈会，就发展少数民族地区的广播事业问题，交换了意见。
