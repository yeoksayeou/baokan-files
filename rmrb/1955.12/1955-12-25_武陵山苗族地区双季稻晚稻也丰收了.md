To the Editor:

    When the Miao and Han farmers in the Wuling Mountains have finished the autumn harvest and started winter planting, there are still golden rice ears in a rice field in Yaxi Township, Jishou County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture. People passing by here say with envy: The late rice of the double-season rice of the Red Flag Agricultural Production Cooperative has another bumper harvest!

    Growing double-season rice is something that has never happened in the Miao area for generations. Last spring, Zhang Longqing, a provincial first-class agricultural labor model in Yaxi Township, tried to grow nine and a half acres of double-season rice with the help of the mutual aid group. At that time, many honest farmers worried about him. Because Zhang Longqing actively improved farming techniques, his experiment finally succeeded, and he harvested more than 700 catties of grain in two seasons.

    In January of this year, the mutual aid group led by Zhang Longqing was transformed into the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative. The cooperative planned to try planting seven acres of double-season rice. At that time, some cooperative members were afraid of "losing at both ends"; some people outside the cooperative were also talking about it behind their backs. However, with the support of the Party, the cooperative committee finally persuaded the members to adopt this measure to increase grain production.

    Zhang Longqing took out his "Nante No." early rice seeds, which he had successfully trial-planted last year, as an investment in the cooperative. On March 26, the cooperative completed sowing more than half a month earlier than the average local farmers. Because they implemented salt water seed selection, shallow and dense planting, timely irrigation and drainage, applied sufficient cow dung and grass ash as base fertilizer, and diligently cultivated, topdressed, and prevented and controlled various natural disasters, on July 30, when the rice in ordinary mountain fields had just begun to droop, the threshing drums of the Red Flag Cooperative began to sound. The average yield of the cooperative's seven acres of double-season early rice was 475 catties per mu, which has exceeded the yield of local medium rice. On the afternoon of the harvest, farmers came to exchange seeds; many mutual aid groups and farmers expressed their desire to apply to transfer to the cooperative and join the cooperative.

    More than a month before the early rice harvest, they had actively prepared for sowing late rice. As soon as the early rice was harvested, the cooperative immediately plowed the fields, applied base fertilizer and lime, and planted double-season late rice under the moonlight the next day. The cooperative members took care of the seedlings like mothers care for their children's growth, and finally the late rice also had a good harvest. The average yield of early and late rice per mu was 709 catties, an increase of more than 50% compared with the local single-season rice.

    This miracle in the Wuling Mountains has given the Miao and Han farmers inside and outside the cooperative a great education and encouragement. Shi Qiugui, the Miao vice-chairman of the Red Flag Cooperative, said excitedly: "The road to increased production has been found." The cooperative committee has initially decided to plant all of the cooperative's more than 30 mu of land that can be expanded for double-season rice next year with double-season rice. Shi Yuangui's (Miao) mutual aid group has decided to plant eight mu of double-season rice next year; the newly built Qianjin Cooperative has also requested the Red Flag Cooperative to exchange seeds and plans to try planting eleven mu of double-season rice next year. The Miao and Han farmers in the township are actively requesting to join the cooperative. In order to expand the planting area of double-season rice next year, the township is actively preparing to build a flood discharge and irrigation project this winter that can increase the irrigation capacity of more than 400 mu.

### 武陵山苗族地区双季稻晚稻也丰收了

    武陵山苗族地区双季稻晚稻也丰收了编辑同志：
    当武陵山区苗、汉各族农民秋收已经完毕而开始冬种的时候，湘西苗族自治州吉首县鸦溪乡的一片稻田里却还有着黄灿灿的谷穗。人们路过这里，都带着欣羡的神情说：红旗农业生产合作社的双季稻晚稻又丰收了！
    种双季稻，这在苗区是祖祖辈辈以来从来没有过的事情。去年春天，鸦溪乡的省甲等农业劳动模范张隆庆在互助组的帮助下试种了九分五厘田的双季稻。当时，许多老实农民都替他担心。由于张隆庆积极改进耕作技术，他的试验终于成功了，两季共收得七百多斤谷子。
    今年一月，张隆庆所领导的互助组转为红旗农业社了。社里计划试种七亩双季稻。当时有些社员生怕“扁担骨扎、两头失塌”；社外有的人也背后议论纷纷。但是，社务委员会在党的支持下，终于说服社员采取了这个增产粮食的措施。
    张隆庆拿出了自己去年试种成功的“南特号”早稻种子投资在社里。三月二十六日，社里比当地一般农民提前半个多月完成了播种。由于他们实行了盐水选种、浅插密植、及时排灌，施了足够的牛粪和草木灰等作底肥，又勤于耘田、追肥和防治各种自然灾害，七月三十日，当一般山田的稻禾才开始勾头，红旗社的扮桶就响声了。全社七亩双季早稻，每亩平均产量四百七十五斤，已经超过了当地中稻的产量。收获那天下午，就有农民来换种谷；许多互助组和农民纷纷表示要申请转社和入社。
    在早稻收割前一个多月，他们已经积极进行了播种晚稻的准备工作。早稻刚收割完，社里立即把田犁过来，施上底肥和石灰，在第二天月光下又插上了双季稻晚稻。社员们像母亲关心孩子成长一样照料着秧苗，终于晚稻又得到了好收成。早晚两季稻谷每亩平均产量共是七百○九斤，比当地一季稻增产百分之五十以上。
    武陵山区里的这个奇迹，给社内外的苗、汉各族农民一个很大的教育和鼓舞。红旗社的苗族副社长石求贵兴奋地说：“增产大门路算是找出来了。”社务委员会初步决定，明年要把社里能够扩种双季稻的三十多亩地全都种上双季稻。石元贵（苗族）互助组已经决定明年种植八亩双季稻；新建的前进社也要求红旗社换种子，明年准备试种十一亩双季稻。全乡苗、汉农民正积极要求入社。为了明年扩大双季稻种植面积，乡里正在积极准备在今冬修建一个能增加四百多亩灌溉能力的排洪灌溉工程。
