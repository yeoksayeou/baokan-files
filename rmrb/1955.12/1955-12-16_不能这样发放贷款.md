In some areas of Guangdong Province, the distribution of loans from the Poor Peasants Cooperative Fund has not been done well. In certain rural areas of Deqing County, some rural cadres, fearing offending the wealthy peasants, only referred to the Poor Peasants Cooperative Fund loans as "Cooperative Fund Loans," not daring to even mention the word "Poor Peasants." In Haikang County, an accountant named Wu Shouxun in one cooperative only owed thirteen yuan for his membership share fund. He had just sold a pig for forty yuan, which was more than enough to pay his share fund, yet he received a Poor Peasants Cooperative Fund loan. Meanwhile, Wu Shuguo, the poorest member of the same cooperative, received nothing. In the Lianhu Township Second Agricultural Cooperative of Boluo County, all those who received Poor Peasants Cooperative Fund loans were members of the cooperative's management committee and production team leaders, while the ordinary members, regardless of whether they had difficulties or not, received nothing. In the Laishan Agricultural Cooperative of Dan County, middle peasants accounted for eleven of the twenty households that received Poor Peasants Cooperative Fund loans. Some areas have also adopted a method of equal distribution, issuing a share to everyone regardless of whether members have difficulties or the extent of their difficulties. In the Xinling First Agricultural Cooperative of Xingning County, five cooperative members received Poor Peasants Cooperative Fund loans, but they themselves knew nothing about it until they actually received the loans, because the application, loan agreement, and other procedures were all handled by the cooperative cadres.

The practice of not lending Poor Peasants Cooperative Fund loans to poor peasants is wrong. Agricultural banks and county and district Party committees in various regions should conduct an inspection of the distribution of Poor Peasants Cooperative Fund loans. The staff members responsible for distributing the loans must receive thorough class policy education, so that they truly give the Poor Peasants Cooperative Fund loans to the poor peasants.

    不能这样发放贷款
    在广东省某些地区，贫农合作基金贷款的发放工作做得不好。德庆县某些农村干部因为害怕得罪富裕农民，把贫农合作基金贷款只说是“合作基金贷款”，连“贫农”两字都不敢提。海康县有一个社的会计员吴守训，只欠入社股份基金十三元，他刚卖了一头猪得四十元，缴股份基金还有余，却得到了一份贫农合作基金贷款；而同一个社里最穷的社员吴守国却一点也没有得到。博罗县莲湖乡第二农业合作社中，得到贫农合作基金贷款的都是社务管理委员和生产小组长，而一般的社员，不管你有没有困难，一个也得不到。儋县来山农业合作社中得到贫农合作基金贷款的二十户中，中农就占了十一户。也有些地区采取平均分配的办法，不管社员有没有困难或是困难大小，都照样发放一份。兴宁县新领第一农业合作社，有五户社员得到了贫农合作基金贷款，但是当他们还没有拿到贷款的时候，他们自己什么也不知道，原因是申请、立据等都由社干部包办了。
    不把贫农合作基金贷款贷给贫农的做法是错误的。各地农业银行和县区党委应该对贫农合作基金贷款的发放工作进行一次检查；对发放贷款的工作人员必须切实进行阶级政策教育，使他们把贫农合作基金贷款真正发到贫农手里。
