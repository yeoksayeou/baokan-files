Gorky Hydroelectric Station
By Our Moscow Correspondent Li He

    October 10th: The second batch of three turbines at the Kama Hydroelectric Station generates electricity.
    October 18th: The first turbine at the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station generates electricity.
    November 2nd: The first turbine at the Gorky Hydroelectric Station generates electricity.

    As the days draw closer to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, more and more good news is coming from the Soviet production front, especially from the construction sites of hydroelectric power stations that add a solid material foundation for communist construction.

    These three hydroelectric power stations are all projects within the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Just as when I went to the Kama and Kakhovka Hydroelectric Stations, when I arrived at the Gorky Hydroelectric Station, the project was basically nearing completion.

    The Gorky Hydroelectric Station is near the city of Gorky. The city of Gorky is located on the banks of the Volga River, east of Moscow. Before 1932, it was called Nizhny Novgorod, the birthplace of Sverdlov and Gorky. This old commercial city in the old Russian era has become a mechanical industrial center for manufacturing automobiles, ships, engines, milling machines, etc., after several five-year plans following the October Revolution. The construction of the hydroelectric power station brings broader prospects to the industry of Gorky City and Gorky Oblast, as well as the surrounding agriculture, because the Gorky Hydroelectric Station will supply as much electricity as all the power stations in pre-revolutionary Russia combined.

    Upstream of Gorky City, the Volga River makes a small bend, and sand has silted up several small islands. The hydroelectric station is built using this convenient terrain. Engineers from the construction bureau led us to the highlands on the right bank, where we could see the spillway dam and the hydroelectric station building without obstruction. The spillway dam looks like a long bridge with many piers about to be completed, spanning the river. On the side of the spillway dam, on top of the hydroelectric station building, a 500-ton tower crane is installing turbines. The workers guarantee that more than five turbines will generate electricity before the end of the year. Eight huge turbines with a generating capacity of 50,000 kilowatts each will be installed in this section of the building, with a total generating capacity of 400,000 kilowatts. This will exceed the total generating capacity of the first part of the Kama Hydroelectric Station (which will generate 125,000 kilowatts) and the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station (which will generate 250,000 kilowatts). On the other side of the spillway dam are two-stage locks. The hydroelectric station building, spillway dam, locks, earth embankments, etc., have a total length of more than 20 kilometers.

    Although the Gorky Hydroelectric Station made good use of the terrain, its project is still massive. From the start of construction in 1951 to the start of the first turbine, 80 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed here, 1.37 million cubic meters of concrete and reinforced concrete have been poured, and 120,000 tons of steel frame have been constructed. Such a large-scale project is naturally carried out with the support of the entire country. More than 500 enterprises across the Soviet Union supply it with building materials, machines, and equipment. Therefore, the heavy and large-scale work here can be highly mechanized. For example, all concrete preparation and pouring, and 98 percent of the earthwork, are mechanized.

    We climbed onto the future roof of the hydroelectric station building, breathing the moist and fresh air of the river, and looked out into the distance. This magnificent section of the Volga River, cleverly utilized, and the prosperous atmosphere on both sides of the river are truly fascinating.

    New townships are springing up along both banks. The foundations of these future cities consist of approximately 1.5 million square meters of housing and many spacious and bright schools, hospitals, kindergartens, clubs, libraries, shops, and canteens. These townships were originally built by construction workers for their own lives. When they complete this project and move to new construction sites, they will build new townships near the new construction sites and hand over the townships here to the residents of future cities. The construction workers of major construction sites in the Soviet Union are, in fact, not only builders of huge projects but also creators of the prototypes of future cities.

    Upstream of the hydroelectric station, a long and wide artificial sea with an area of 140,000 hectares has appeared. The dam of the hydroelectric station raised the level of the Volga River from Gorodets (Gorky Oblast) to Shcherbakov (Yaroslavl Oblast) by about 18 meters, forming a large reservoir – the “Gorky Sea.” It will ensure that the hydroelectric station has an ample supply of priceless white coal – water power – and facilitate the navigation of large ships.

    From a high place, the surface of the Volga River appears calm. When we took a riverboat to the middle of the river, we felt that the river surface was particularly magnificent, the river water was quite turbulent, and the river waves were also considerable, especially when the speedboat hit the river water, causing bursts of loud spray.

    The riverboat took us to the dam that blocked the surging river on August 24th. According to eyewitnesses, on the day of the "closure," there was a bridge here, and two rows of sixty dump trucks loaded with rocks were racing back and forth on the bridge. They simultaneously dumped thousands of cubic meters of rocks into the rapid river. The river was unwilling to yield, and as the piled-up rocks approached the river surface, the river's resistance increased, and the rapids were washing away the rocks. At this time, people threw in prefabricated reinforced concrete cross-shaped pier blocks. These pier blocks were heavy and could not be overturned by the current, so they protected the rocks. Because the preparatory work was done well and the stone was thrown quickly, a lot of time and materials were saved. The riverbed, which was 300 meters wide and 11 meters deep, was expected to be blocked in eight days and nights, but it was blocked in less than 12 hours; it was expected to throw 30,000 cubic meters of stone, but only 16,000 cubic meters of stone and about 3,000 cubic meters of concrete pier blocks were thrown. A layer of gravel and sand was laid on this dam. Walking on it is like walking on a main road. From now on, the ancient Russian river can only follow the will of the Soviets and take a new path through the dam holes of the spillway dam.

    Now, fewer staff and machines can be seen at the Gorky Hydroelectric Station construction site because the project is basically completed, and many workers and machines have been transferred to other construction sites. All eight turbines of the hydroelectric station will generate electricity in the autumn of 1956, and its electricity will be put into the unified power grid with Moscow.

    Under the leadership of 1,500 Communist Party members, all the employees of the Gorky Hydroelectric Station construction project carried out socialist competitions, created advanced methods such as cold-laid concrete and deep drainage, and they not only completed the project tasks on schedule, but also cultivated a large number of talents for the country. Among all 860 engineering and technical personnel, many grew up on the construction site. More than 10,000 bricklayers, dike builders, steel frame workers, concrete workers, welders, graders, crane operators, and excavator operators were also trained.

    When I left the Gorky Hydroelectric Station, I passed a secondary technical school in the town. The classrooms, laboratories, and library inside are all very good. This school is training hundreds of students. Many employees study in the night classes of this school according to their majors. This beautiful building was originally prepared for the construction bureau to use as an office. Later, the leaders of the construction bureau allocated it to the school, and they have been working in small temporary wooden houses.

    This spirit of attaching importance to the cultivation of talents can be compared with the construction of the hydroelectric station itself.

    高尔基水电站
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    十月十日：卡马水电站的第二批三部水轮机发电。
    十月十八日：卡霍夫卡水电站的第一部水轮机发电。
    十一月二日：高尔基水电站的第一部水轮机发电。
    日子越走近苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，苏联生产战线上传出越来越多捷报，特别是为共产主义建设增添雄厚物质基础的水电站工地上。
    这三个水电站都是第五个五年计划期内的工程。正像到卡马和卡霍夫卡水电站时一样，我到高尔基水电站时，那里的工程已基本上接近完成了。
    高尔基水电站，在高尔基城附近。高尔基城站在莫斯科以东的伏尔加河岸上。它在一九三二年以前叫做尼日尼诺沃哥罗德，是斯维尔德洛夫和高尔基出生的地方。这个在旧俄时代古老的商业城市，在十月革命后经过几个五年计划，已经成为制造汽车、轮船、发动机、铣床等机械工业中心了。水电站的建筑，带给高尔基城和高尔基州的工业以及周围的农业更广阔的远景。因为高尔基水电站将供给革命前俄国全部发电站所发出的那么多电力。
    在高尔基城的上手，伏尔加河绕一个小弯，流沙淤积了几个小岛。水电站就是利用这个方便的地势建筑起来的。建筑局的工程师引我们到右岸的高地上，从这里一览无余地看见溢水坝和水电站建筑物。溢水坝好像快落成的多墩长桥，横跨河面。在溢水坝这边，水电站建筑物上面，五百吨的塔形起重机正在安装水轮机。工人们保证：在年底以前要使五部以上的水轮机发电。在这一段建筑物中要安装发电力各五万瓩的巨大水轮机八部，总发电能力达到四十万瓩。这将超过卡马水电站第一部分（将发电十二万五千瓩）和卡霍夫卡水电站（将发电二十五万瓩）的发电力的总和。在溢水坝那边，是两级的水闸。水电站建筑物、溢水坝、水闸、土堤等等，全长在二十公里以上。
    虽然高尔基水电站很好地利用了地形，它的工程还是浩大的。从一九五一年开始建筑时起到第一部水轮机发动时止，这里已完成了八千万立方公尺土工，浇筑了一百三十七万立方公尺混凝土和钢筋混凝土，构搭了十二万吨钢铁骨架。这样大规模的工程，自然是在全国支援之下进行的。全苏联有五百多个企业供给它建筑材料、机器和设备。所以这里繁重的和规模巨大的工作，有可能高度地机械化。例如，全部混凝土的准备和浇灌，百分之九十八的土工，都是机械化的。
    我们登上水电站建筑物的未来的房顶，呼吸着河水的润湿清新的气息，极目远眺。这一段雄壮的伏尔加河被聪明地利用和两岸兴旺的气象，真是令人百看不厌。
    两岸伸展着新起的集镇。这些未来的城市的基础，是由约一百五十万平方公尺住宅和许多宽敞明亮的学校、医院、幼儿园、俱乐部、图书馆、商店、食堂构成的。这些本来是工地职工为自己的生活建筑的集镇。当他们完成这项工程而转移到新工地去的时候，他们便在新工地附近建筑新集镇，而把这里的集镇交给未来城市的居住者。苏联各大工地的建筑工人，事实上不单是巨大工程的建设者，而且是未来城市雏形的创造者。
    在水电站的上游，一个面积十四万公顷的长阔人工海出现了。水电站的堤坝把从高罗捷茨（高尔基州）到谢尔巴科夫（雅罗斯拉夫斯基州）这一段伏尔加河面提高约十八公尺，拦蓄成大水库——“高尔基海”。它将保证水电站有充足的无价白煤——水力，而且便于大轮船的航行。
    在高处远眺伏尔加河面仿佛是平静的。当我们乘着河艇驶到河流中腰，便觉得河面格外壮阔，河水相当湍急，河浪也很可观，尤其是当快艇拍击河水，激起一阵阵响亮的浪花的时候。
    河艇把我们带到在八月二十四日拦断了汹涌河流的堤坝上。据目击的人说：“合龙”那一天，在这里有一条桥，桥上穿梭地奔驰着两行满载岩石的六十辆自卸大卡车。它们向湍急的河流同时投下千百立方公尺的岩石。河流不愿意屈服，当填积起来的岩石越接近河面时，河流反抗越大，急流在冲走着岩石。这时，人们把预先准备好的钢筋混凝土制的交叉十字形架墩投进去。这些架墩又重又冲不翻，就保住了岩石。由于准备工作做得好，石料投得快，大大节省了时间和材料。宽三百公尺、深十一公尺的河床，预计要八昼夜拦断，结果在十二小时以内拦断了；预计要投三万立方公尺石料，结果只投了一万六千立方公尺石料和约三千立方公尺的混凝土架墩。在这条堤坝上铺了一层石子和砂土。走在上面，宛如走在一条大道上。古老的俄罗斯大河，从此以后只能按照苏维埃人的意志，经过溢水坝的坝洞，走着新道了。
    现在，在高尔基水电站工地已经不大看见工作人员和机器，因为工程基本上完成，许多工人和机器转移到别的工地去了。水电站的八部水轮机，将在一九五六年秋季全部发电，它的电力将投入和莫斯科统一的发电网中去。
    高尔基水电站建筑工程的全体职工，在一千五百个共产党员带领下，进行了社会主义竞赛，创造了冷筑混凝土和深处排水等等先进方法，他们不但按期完成了工程任务，而且为国家培养了大批人材。全部八百六十个工程技术人员当中，许多是在工地上成长的。还训练了一万多名泥水工、筑堤工、钢架工、混凝土工、电焊工、平土机工、起重机工和掘土机工。
    我离开高尔基水电站的时候，路过镇上的一座中等技术学校。里面的教室、实验室、图书馆都很好。这所学校训练着几百个学生。许多职工按照自己的专业在这个学校的夜班学习。这座漂亮的建筑物原来是预备给建筑局作办公室的。后来建筑局的领导人员们把它拨作学校，而自己一直在矮小的临时木屋里办公。
    这种以培养人材为重的精神，可以和水电站建筑本身相媲美。
