    Thirty Years of Socialist Industrialization
    Soviet Economics Candidate Doctor A. Kuznetsov
    Thirty years ago, on December 18, 1925, the 14th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party began its work. This congress is recorded in history as the congress of industrialization.
    At this congress, it was decided to make the socialist industrialization of the Soviet Union the central task of the Party. The resolution of the congress pointed out: "To carry out economic construction from the following perspective is to transform the Soviet Union from a country that imports machines and equipment into a country that produces machines and equipment, so that the Soviet Union, surrounded by a capitalist environment, will never become an appendage of the capitalist world economy, but an independent economic unit built on socialist principles..."
    The Communist Party and the Soviet state, in formulating the policy of national socialist industrialization, were based on the objective inevitability of history and the urgent and significant interests of socialist construction.
    The Communist Party, which prepared and led the October Socialist Revolution, led Russia onto the road of socialist construction. The expropriation of capitalists and landlords, the establishment of socialist ownership in industry, the emergence of the socialist economy in our national economy, and the construction of the foundation of the new social system that had already begun in the early days of the Soviet regime, rescued the country from the economic and political disasters that threatened it. It was precisely socialism that was able to bring prosperity to the Russian economy, develop Russian culture, and defend the country's independence and the high standard of living of the people.
    However, socialism can only be built on the basis of large-scale machine production in both cities and villages, because only on this basis can the high level of social labor productivity necessary for the victory of the socialist system be achieved. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the great leader of the working people, taught: "The only material basis for socialism is large-scale machine industry, which can also transform agriculture."
    Tsarist Russia, with the largest territory in the world and the third largest population (after China and India), ranked fifth in the world in terms of total industrial output, and its national economic structure was also backward. In the national economy of old Russia, agriculture, and mainly small-scale, small-production, and backward agriculture, predominated. Heavy industry was extremely backward. Foreign capitalists controlled the main sectors of heavy industry. In terms of importing machines and equipment, Russia was dependent on capitalist developed countries.
    Therefore, industrialization was as necessary as air for building socialism. But what the Soviet Union needed was not just any kind of industrialization, but an industrialization that would ensure the rapid growth of socialist forms of industry, first of all, to ensure the growth of heavy industry, because it is the foundation of industrialization, the source of technological progress, and the key to the socialist transformation of agriculture. At the same time, industrialization also ensured the country's technological and economic independence and its strong and highly defensive capabilities.
    In order to realize the main task of the socialist transformation of our country and its entire national economy in the shortest possible period of history, it was necessary to accelerate the pace of socialist industrialization. The accelerated pace of industrialization was determined by the domestic and foreign conditions of the development of the world's first socialist country. Joseph Stalin said: "We are fifty to one hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must cover this distance in ten years. Either we do it, or we will be overthrown."
    The superiority of the socialist national economic system and the characteristics of the socialist industrialization method have enabled industrialization to be realized at an unprecedented speed in history.
    The 14th Congress of the Communist Party put such a historically significant task before the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. And now, the whole world knows that this great task has been successfully completed. As a result of the early completion of the first two five-year plans (1928-1937) before the war, as a result of the implementation of the policy of industrialization, the Soviet Union has become a powerful socialist industrial country, and socialism has taken complete dominance in the entire national economy. The heavy industry built by the hands of the Soviet working people, with its core—advanced machine manufacturing, has become the foundation of the foundation of the socialist economy.
    Naturally, this does not mean that the program and policy of socialist industrialization ended at this time. Absolutely not. Even now, when the Soviet state is confidently advancing along the road of communism, the policy of socialist industrialization, the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, is still the foundation of the economic policy of the Soviet state. The development of socialist industry, especially heavy industry, is still the foundation for the development of the entire national economy, because without this, there can be no technological progress, no construction of the material and production base of communism, no realization of the increase in social labor productivity, and no further increase in the welfare of the people.
    The course of events has shown that the choice of the road of industrialization was absolutely correct, and the speed of industrialization was also correct, and the method of socialist industrialization was the only correct method, and as a result, in a period of ten to twelve years, the Soviet state has been listed as an advanced industrial country in the world.
    It is a difficult task to realize industrialization in a huge, formerly backward country. This requires a large amount of material and financial consumption, and requires the heroic efforts of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. The working people of the Soviet Union did not use enslaving loans from outside, but used their own strength and relied on the country's internal resources to solve the problem of capital accumulation necessary for industrialization. The Soviet state, led by the Communist Party, successfully overcame all the difficulties related to the completion of these complex tasks of socialist industrialization. The socialist competition of the whole people, the development of the creative initiative and enthusiasm of millions of working people, and their revolutionary enthusiasm played and continue to play a huge role in this cause.
    As a result, socialist industry has become the decisive force of the national economy. The production of means of production occupies a major position in the total output of industrial products. Heavy industry plays a leading role in both industry and the entire national economy. Relying on the development of socialist industry, agriculture has been reorganized on the principle of collectivization, and agriculture has become a huge, mechanized socialist economy.
    The Soviet Union's industry has caught up with and surpassed the industry of major capitalist countries in terms of development speed and technical level.
    The Soviet Union has become a country of metal, a powerful country with a strong metallurgical industry and machine manufacturing industry. It has been able to guarantee the production of various modern types of machines with its own internal strength, building factories, power stations, railways, residential buildings, and manufacturing the widest variety of metal products.
    The Soviet Union has guaranteed the widespread realization of the electrification of the national economy. In 1913, old Russia only had some power stations with a total generating capacity of one million kilowatts.
    According to the Soviet Russian Electrification Plan, formulated under the leadership of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin in 1920-1921, it was planned to build a batch of power stations with a total generating capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts in ten to fifteen years. By the end of 1935, this plan had been overfulfilled by one and a half times. On the eve of the Second World War, the generating capacity of power stations throughout the Soviet Union had exceeded 10 million kilowatts. In 1913, the national electricity production was less than 2 billion kilowatt-hours, while in 1940, the electricity production had exceeded 48 billion kilowatt-hours, and in 1955, it had approached 166 billion kilowatt-hours.
    The Great Patriotic War caused significant sacrifices of personnel and a large consumption of material resources to the Soviet Union. The war hindered the peaceful economic construction of the Soviet Union. After the victorious end of the war, the Soviet Union made use of the superiority of the socialist economic system to quickly restore the pre-war production level of industry and continue to advance, and successfully overfulfilled the tasks of the first post-war and the first five-year plan.
    Now, the level of industrial production in our country has exceeded the level of 1913 by 26 times. Particularly great achievements have been made in the development of the production of means of production: the total output of industrial sectors that manufacture means of production has increased by 59 times compared with 1913. And the output of the machine manufacturing industry has increased by 159 times compared with pre-revolutionary Russia.
    Joseph Stalin pointed out in his famous February 9, 1946 speech to voters that the Party had intended to organize a new and powerful upsurge in our national economy, and to make our country's output of pig iron reach 50 million tons, steel reach 60 million tons, coal reach 500 million tons, and oil reach 60 million tons in three new five-year plans. Life has not only confirmed Stalin's prediction, but also shown that the Soviet Union has the possibility to accelerate the realization of this prediction. In 1955, oil production has reached 70 million tons, pig iron production is more than 33 million tons, steel production is about 45 million tons, and coal production is 390 million tons. The development speed of these production sectors shows that the Soviet Union will complete the plan formulated by the Soviet Communist Party before the end of the third post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule. This will be a major step forward in the cause of creating conditions for the further smooth construction of a communist society in the Soviet Union.
    The extensive plan to build new hydropower stations and giant thermal power stations is being successfully completed. The construction of magnificent hydropower stations such as the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station on the Volga River and the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, and the Bratsk Hydropower Station on the Angara River, has been well-known to the world. Currently, the Soviet Union ranks second in the world in electricity production, second only to the United States.
    The Soviet Union is the initiator of the peaceful use of atomic energy, and atomic energy has foreshadowed new and endless possibilities for technological progress. The world's first power station powered by atomic energy, with a generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, has already generated electricity. Atomic power stations with generating capacities of 50,000 kilowatts and 100,000 kilowatts are being established.
    In 1920, bourgeois writers and activists considered Lenin's All-Russian Electrification Plan to be a fantasy. History has proved how ignorant bourgeois commentators are of the laws of historical development: life has disgraced them and proved the correctness of all the most daring ideals of the Communists. At present, a new era of technological progress has been opened on the basis of the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    The achievements of socialist industry are very great and undeniable. But the Soviet people are never complacent about these achievements. The interests of our socialist motherland require further improvement of industry on the highest technical basis, and continuous increase and improvement of socialist production. It is necessary to make full use of the achievements of modern science and technology in order to further increase social labor productivity, catch up with and surpass the major capitalist country—the United States—in terms of economy, that is, in terms of the level of industrial production per capita, and achieve a complete victory in the economic competition with the capitalist system.
    The Soviet people, under the leadership of the vanguard of communism, are currently paying attention to further technological progress in industry and agriculture. The further development process of socialist industry, agriculture, and transportation is being carried out under the banner of continuous improvement of technology.
    Thirty years have passed since the Party's Industrialization Congress—the 14th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party—was held. In terms of the scope of history, this is a very short period. But since then, the class, economic, and technological face of our country has fundamentally changed. The Soviet Union has become a powerful industrial country, and is now practically solving the problem of building communism.
    The 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, which will be held in February 1956, will discuss the tasks of further development of the national economy on the road to communism. The 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party will reveal new and broad prospects for Soviet communist construction, and will arm our people with a combat program for fighting for new great achievements.

    社会主义工业化三十年
    苏联经济学候补博士  阿·库兹涅佐夫
    三十年以前，一九二五年十二月十八日，苏联共产党第十四次代表大会开始了自己的工作，这次代表大会是作为工业化的代表大会载入史册的。
    在这次代表大会上决定把苏联社会主义工业化作为党的中心任务。在代表大会的决议中指出：“从下述角度进行经济建设，就是使苏联由输入机器和装备的国家变成生产机器和装备的国家，使在资本主义包围环境中的苏联因此而绝不致变成资本主义世界经济的附庸，而是一个按社会主义原则进行建设的独立自主的经济单位……”。
    共产党和苏维埃国家在制定国家社会主义工业化的政策时是根据历史的客观必然性和社会主义建设的迫切的、重大的利益的。
    准备和领导了十月社会主义革命的共产党使俄国走上了社会主义建设的道路。对资本家和地主的剥夺，在工业中社会主义所有制形式的建立，在我国国民经济中社会主义经济的产生和在苏维埃政权初期就已经开始的新社会制度基础的建设，把国家从威胁着它的经济和政治灾难中挽救出来。正是社会主义才能够给俄国经济带来繁荣，发展俄国的文化，保卫国家的独立和人民生活的高度水平。
    然而，社会主义只有在城市和乡村都实行大规模的机器生产的基础上才可能建成，因为只有在这个基础上才能达到那为社会主义制度胜利所必需的高度社会劳动生产率水平。劳动人民的伟大领袖弗·伊·列宁教导说：“社会主义的唯一物质基础，就是同时也能改造农业的大机器工业。”
    领土占世界第一位，而人口占第三位（次于中国和印度）的沙皇俄国，在工业品总产量方面占世界第五位，它的国民经济的结构也是落后的。在旧俄的国民经济中，农业、而且主要是小农的、小生产的、落后的农业占着优势。重工业是极端落后的。外国资本家控制了重工业中的主要部门。在输入机器和装备方面，俄国依赖资本主义发达的国家。
    因此，工业化对于建成社会主义就像空气一样的必要。但是苏联所需要的并不是一般的随便一种什么工业化，而是这样的工业化，这种工业化将保证社会主义形式工业的迅速增长，首先是保证重工业的增长，因为它是工业化的基础，是技术进步的泉源和走向农业的社会主义改造的关键。同时，工业化也保证了国家的技术经济的独立和它的坚强的、高度防御能力。
    为着在历史的最短时期实现对我国和它的全部国民经济的社会主义改造的主要任务，就必需加快速度进行社会主义工业化。工业化的加快速度是由世界上第一个社会主义国家发展的国内外条件所决定的。约·维·斯大林说：“我们比先进国家落后了五十年至一百年。我们应当在十年以内跑完这个距离。或者是我们做到这一点，或者是我们被人打翻。”
    社会主义国民经济制度的优越性和社会主义工业化方法的特点，使工业化在历史上以空前的速度实现了。
    共产党第十四次代表大会把这样一项具有历史意义的任务提到苏联各族人民的面前。而现在，全世界都知道这一伟大任务是顺利地完成了，由于战前头两个五年计划（一九二八年至一九三七年）提前完成的结果，由于工业化政策的实行，苏联变成了一个强大的社会主义工业国家，在全部国民经济中社会主义占了完全统治地位。由苏联劳动人民双手建立的重工业同它的核心——先进的机器制造业成了社会主义经济基础的基础。
    自然，这并不是说社会主义工业化的纲领和政策到这个时期已经结束了。绝对不是的。即使现在，当苏维埃国家满怀信心地沿着共产主义道路前进的时候，社会主义工业化的政策，优先发展重工业的政策，仍然是苏维埃国家经济政策的基础。发展社会主义工业，首先是重工业仍是发展整个国民经济的基础，因为没有这个，就不可能有技术进步，就不可能建成共产主义的物质生产基础，就不可能实现社会劳动生产率的提高和人民福利的进一步增长。
    事件的进程表明了：工业化的道路选择得绝对正确，而工业化的速度也是正确的，社会主义工业化的方法是唯一正确的方法，而结果在十年至十二年的期间苏维埃国家已列入世界先进工业国家了。
    在一个巨大的、过去落后的国家中实现工业化是一件困难的事情，这需要大量的物资和财政消耗，需要工人、农民、知识分子的英勇努力。苏联的劳动人民不是利用从外面来的奴役性的借款，而是用自己的力量，依靠着国家的内部资源解决了工业化所必需的资金积累问题。由共产党领导的苏维埃国家顺利地克服了同完成社会主义工业化这些复杂任务有关的一切困难。全民的社会主义竞赛、千百万劳动群众创造性倡议和积极性的发展和他们的革命热情，在这个事业中起了并且继续起着巨大的作用。
    结果是社会主义工业变成了国民经济的决定性力量。生产资料的生产在工业品总产量中占主要地位。重工业无论在工业和整个国家经济中都起着主导作用。依靠着社会主义工业的发展，在集体化的原则上改组了农业，农业变成了巨大的、机械化的社会主义经济。
    苏联的工业就发展速度和技术水平说已经赶上并且超过了主要资本主义国家的工业。
    苏联变成了一个金属的国家，变成了一个拥有强大的冶金工业和机器制造业的强国，它已能保证用本身的内部力量生产各种各样的现代型式的机器，建筑工厂、发电站、铁路、住宅建筑物，制造最广泛品种的金属产品。
    苏联曾保证了国民经济电气化的广泛实现。在一九一三年，旧俄只拥有发电能力共一百万瓩的一些发电站。
    根据一九二○—一九二一年在弗·伊·列宁领导下制定的苏维埃俄国电气化计划，曾计划在十年到十五年内建设总发电能力为一百五十万瓩的一批发电站。到一九三五年年底，这个计划被超额完成了一倍半。在第二次世界大战前夕，苏联全国发电站的发电能力已超过一千万瓩。一九一三年全国的电力生产还不到二十亿度，而一九四○年的电力生产已超过四百八十亿度，一九五五年已接近一千六百六十亿度。
    伟大卫国战争曾使苏联遭到人员的重大牺牲和物质资源的大量消耗。战争妨碍了苏联的和平经济建设。苏联在战争胜利结束以后，曾利用社会主义经济制度的优越性，使工业迅速地恢复了战前的生产水平，并继续前进，胜利地超额完成了战后第一个和第一个五年计划的任务。
    现在，我国工业生产水平已超过一九一三年的水平二十六倍。在发展生产资料的生产方面获得了特别巨大的成绩：制造生产资料的工业部门的产品总量比一九一三年增加了五十九倍。而机器制造业的产品量比革命前的俄国增加了一百五十九倍。
    约·维·斯大林在他的著名的一九四六年二月九日对选民的演说中曾指出，党已立意要组织我国国民经济的新的强大高涨，要在三个新的五年计划中使我国生铁的产量达到五千万吨，钢达到六千万吨，煤炭达到五亿吨，石油达到六千万吨。生活不仅证实了斯大林的这个预见，并且还表明苏联有可能加速这个预见的实现。一九五五年石油的产量已经达到七千万吨，生铁的产量是三千三百多万吨，钢的产量约四千五百万吨，煤炭的产量是三亿九千万吨。这些生产部门的发展速度表明，苏联将在战后第三个五年计划结束以前，提早完成苏联共产党所制定的计划。这在为苏联进一步顺利建设共产主义社会创造条件的事业中，将是前进的一个重大步骤。
    建设新的水电站和巨型火力发电站的广泛计划，正在顺利完成。像伏尔加河上的古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站、安加拉河上的布拉次克水电站等这类宏伟的水电站的建设已为全世界所熟知。目前在电力生产方面苏联仅次于美国而占世界第二位。
    苏联是和平利用原子能的首创者，原子能已为技术进步预示出新的无穷无尽的可能。世界上第一个以原子能发动的、有五千瓩发电能力的发电站已经发电。正在建立五万瓩和十万瓩发电能力的原子能发电站。
    在一九二○年时，资产阶级的著作家和活动家认为列宁的全俄电气化计划是一种空想。历史证明了资产阶级评论家们对历史发展规律是多么无知：生活使他们丢脸，并证明了共产党人的全部最大胆的理想的正确。目前在和平利用原子能的基础上已开辟了技术进步的新纪元。
    社会主义工业的成就是非常伟大和无可辩驳的。但是苏联人民绝不因这些成绩而自满。我们社会主义祖国的利益要求在最高的技术基础上进一步提高工业，不断地增加和改进社会主义的生产。需要全力利用现代科学和技术的成就以便更加提高社会劳动生产率，在经济方面，即在按人口计算的工业生产水平方面，赶上并超过主要的资本主义国家——美国，并在同资本主义制度的经济竞赛中取得完全的胜利。
    在共产主义的先锋队领导下的苏联人民，目前正在注意于工业和农业中的进一步技术进步。社会主义工业、农业和运输业的进一步发展过程，正在不断改进技术的标志下进行着。
    自从党的工业化代表大会——苏联共产党第十四次代表大会——举行以来，已经过去三十年了。按历史的范围说，这是一个很短的时期。但是从那时起，我国的阶级、经济和技术的面貌已经根本改变了。苏联成了一个强大的工业国家，并且在现在就已经实际上解决着建设共产主义的问题。
    在即将于一九五六年二月召开的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上将讨论国民经济在向共产主义道路上进一步发展的任务。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会将揭示苏联共产主义建设的新的广阔远景，并将用为新的伟大成绩而斗争的战斗性纲领来武装我国人民。
