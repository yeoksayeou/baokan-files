    National Conference on Workers' Spare-Time Education Opens in Beijing
    The Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened the National Conference on Workers' Spare-Time Education on the 19th.
    This conference will, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, discuss the overall plan for workers' spare-time education and the issue of strengthening leadership; clarify the guiding principles and tasks of workers' spare-time education, and systematically study and resolve various problems in all levels of spare-time education from primary school to university.
    Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, delivered a report on the 19th entitled "Vigorously Develop Regular Workers' Spare-Time Education from Primary School to University, and Strive to Improve Workers' Cultural Level and Cultivate Talent for National Construction." In his report, he pointed out that although workers' spare-time education has made considerable progress in the past few years and has made certain contributions to improving workers' cultural level, training cadres, and improving production, there are still some problems that need to be properly resolved. For example, a complete spare-time education system from primary school to university has not yet been established, study time is not guaranteed, the number of teachers is small and their quality is poor, students' entry level is too low, and there is a lack of funding. Failure to solve these problems will seriously hinder the normal development of workers' spare-time education. Yang Xiufeng said that the key to fundamentally changing the backward situation of workers' spare-time education, which lags behind reality and the masses, lies in resolutely overcoming conservative ideas, carrying out overall planning, and strengthening leadership. Yang Xiufeng systematically put forward preliminary opinions on determining the guiding principles and tasks of workers' spare-time education in the future and properly resolving the main problems in the current workers' spare-time education for the delegates to discuss and study.
    The conference is expected to last for ten days, and more than 300 representatives from educational administrative departments of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, trade unions of provinces and cities, propaganda departments of the Chinese Communist Party committees of some provinces and cities, relevant universities and secondary vocational schools with spare-time schools, and relevant departments of the central government are attending the conference.

    全国职工业余教育工作会议在京开幕
    高等教育部、教育部和中华全国总工会在十九日联合召开全国职工业余教育工作会议。
    这次会议将根据中央指示的精神，讨论职工业余教育的全面规划和加强领导的问题；明确职工业余教育的方针任务、并且系统地研究解决从小学到大学的各级业余教育中的各种问题。
    高等教育部部长杨秀峰在十九日的会议上作了题为“大力开展从小学到大学的正规职工业余教育，努力提高职工文化水平和培养国家建设人才”的报告。他在报告中指出，过去几年来，职工业余教育虽然有相当的发展，对提高职工的文化水平、培养干部和改进生产有一定的贡献。但是至今存在着一些问题，需要妥善解决。如还没有建立起从小学到大学的一套完整的业余教育制度、学习时间得不到保证、师资数量少质量差、学生入学程度过低、缺乏经费等。这些问题不解决，就会严重障碍着职工业余教育的正常发展。杨秀峰说，从根本上改变职工业余教育落后于实际、落后于群众的状况，关键就在于坚决克服保守思想，进行全面规划，加强领导。杨秀峰系统地提出关于确定今后职工业余教育的方针任务和妥善解决当前职工业余教育中主要问题的初步意见，供大会代表讨论研究。
    这次会议预期十天，出席会议的有各省、市、自治区教育行政部门、各省市工会、部分省市的中共党委宣传部门、设有业余学校的各有关高等学校和中等专业学校，以及中央各有关部门的代表三百多人。　（新华社）
