    The Ministry of Culture and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued "Instructions on Vigorously Carrying Out Rural Spring Festival Cultural and Artistic Work in 1956" on the 14th. The instructions called on cultural administrative departments and Communist Youth League committees at all levels to closely cooperate with the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement during the Spring Festival period. They were to vigorously mobilize and organize various professional and amateur artistic teams in urban and rural areas to launch large-scale and vigorous mass artistic activities in the countryside.
    The instructions stated that the basic task of rural artistic work around the Spring Festival is to carry out propaganda work centered on the agricultural cooperativization movement. Its main content is: to publicize in a simple and correct way Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on the question of agricultural cooperation, as well as the specific instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao on the overall plan for rural social reform. Based on the spirit and content of these documents and instructions, publicize the bright prospects of a socialist countryside and the superiority of agricultural cooperation, the glorious responsibilities of peasants in the great cause of building a socialist society, the principles and policies of agricultural cooperation and the methods of establishing and consolidating cooperatives, the benefits of the "three fix" policy for grain and the methods of "three fix" to the household, winter production, and literacy work. At the same time, centering on agricultural cooperation, it is also necessary to combine with the local needs of the time to publicize the conscription of new soldiers, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the implementation of the Marriage Law, so as to comprehensively promote rural work. It is also necessary to publicize the First Five-Year Plan, the close relationship between agricultural cooperation and socialist industrialization, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and the socialist transformation of handicrafts, to consolidate and develop the worker-peasant alliance, to publicize the importance of striving for a peaceful international environment for socialist construction, and the sacred right of the Chinese people to Taiwan and the determination to liberate Taiwan.
    The instructions required that culture should be sent to the countryside in a comprehensive way during the Spring Festival. Regarding this, the instructions put forward many specific tasks to the cultural departments: The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and the China Film Distribution Company should guarantee that each rural film projection team is supplied with two feature films (one of which should reflect the agricultural cooperation movement) and several science education and news short films suitable for rural masses to watch. These should be sent to the projection teams before the Spring Festival, together with easy-to-understand propaganda and explanatory materials. The projection teams must guarantee the quality of the screenings, increase the number of screenings, have both a focus and take care of the overall situation, and should especially take care of the needs of ethnic minority areas. The Art Bureau of the Ministry of Culture should cooperate with relevant associations in the literary and art circles to recommend literary and art propaganda materials suitable for amateur art organizations to perform, so as to publish and distribute them. Central and local theaters, troupes, and musical groups should formulate specific plans to go deep into the countryside or urban suburbs for performances and to provide guidance to mass artistic activities during the Spring Festival. Cultural (Education) Bureaus (Departments) of cities and counties should organize folk professional troupes to perform in the countryside in a planned way. The Publication Bureau of the Ministry of Culture should urge relevant publishing houses to publish and supply a large number of Spring Festival rural propaganda materials in a timely manner. Relevant publishing houses at the central level (especially Popular Reading Publishing House and People's Fine Arts Publishing House) and local publishing houses should immediately compile popular pamphlets centered on publicizing the agricultural cooperation movement, as well as small plays, popular stories, comic strips, storytelling, folk art, dances, and other manuscripts suitable for Spring Festival rural artistic activities, and strive to publish them this year. Xinhua Bookstore should earnestly strengthen rural distribution work. Newly published Spring Festival propaganda materials should be sent to branch stores in January 1956. The People's Fine Arts Publishing House should cooperate with the Shanghai Film Projector Parts Manufacturing Plant to produce and distribute a batch of slides suitable for rural areas during the Spring Festival, and select a batch of applicable slides from the existing slides and recommend them to local cultural centers for adoption. Cultural bureaus (departments) of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should immediately compile and select performance materials and print and distribute them to various places in large quantities. Literary and art periodicals in various provinces should publish special collections of Spring Festival performance materials. Local cultural centers and stations should promote and guide rural clubs and other rural cultural organizations to actively carry out mass propaganda. Public libraries can sign contracts with cultural center libraries to do a good job in book circulation. The libraries of cultural centers should pay special attention to strengthening business guidance to rural libraries, and should help establish rural libraries. Cultural centers and stations should use Spring Festival artistic activities to discover and collect folk traditional art and mass creation materials for sorting and promotion.
    Regarding the vigorous development of farmers' amateur cultural activities and the establishment and improvement of farmers' amateur cultural organizations, the instructions proposed: Cultural administrative departments and Communist Youth League committees at all levels should cooperate closely, seize the most active season of rural cultural and artistic activities during the Spring Festival, vigorously lead and help develop farmers' amateur artistic activities, and establish and improve farmers' amateur cultural organizations. In areas where the agricultural cooperation movement has a relatively solid foundation, around the Spring Festival, the existing rural clubs and various mass cultural organizations should be consolidated and reorganized through the development of farmers' amateur cultural activities. On the other hand, rural clubs should be boldly developed on the basis of cooperatives. In areas where the cooperation movement started relatively late and the foundation is relatively weak, various cultural organizations should be helped to be established according to the needs and possibilities of the masses, actively carry out activities, and prepare for the universal establishment of rural clubs in the future.
    The instructions required that industrial and mining enterprises, basic construction sites, newly built railway lines, and large and medium-sized cities should also plan various cultural and entertainment activities during the Spring Festival to carry out propaganda on socialist industrialization, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and handicrafts, and agricultural cooperation. In particular, it is necessary to plan worker-peasant get-togethers to strengthen the propaganda and education of the worker-peasant alliance.
    The instructions finally stated that cultural administrative departments and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels should, under the leadership of the Party committees, comprehensively plan Spring Festival artistic activities, and should give help and encouragement to the mass artistic activities, while preventing extravagance and waste and deviations that violate policies.

    指示说，春节前后农村文艺工作的基本任务是进行以农业合作化运动为中心的宣传工作。它的主要内容是：通俗地和正确地宣传毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议以及中共中央和毛主席对于农村社会改革全面规划的具体指示，并且根据这些文件、指示的精神和内容，宣传社会主义农村的光辉远景和农业合作化的优越性，农民在建设社会主义社会的伟大事业中的光荣责任，农业合作化的方针政策和建社、整社的办法，粮食“三定”政策的好处和“三定”到户的办法，冬季生产和扫盲工作。同时，环绕着农业合作化，还应该结合当地当时的需要，宣传征集新兵、镇压反革命和贯彻婚姻法等等，来全面地推动农村工作；还应该宣传第一个五年计划，宣传农业合作化同社会主义工业化、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造以及手工业的社会主义改造之间的密切关系，宣传巩固和发展工农联盟，宣传争取和平的国际环境来进行社会主义建设的重要性，以及中国人民对台湾的神圣权利和解放台湾的决心。
    指示要求，在春节期间应该全面地实行文化下乡。关于这方面，指示向各文化部门提出了许多具体任务：文化部电影事业管理局和中国电影发行公司应该保证供应每个农村电影放映队两部故事片（其中一部要是反映农业合作化运动的）和几种适合于农村群众观看的科学教育、新闻短片，在春节前连同通俗易懂的宣传解释材料，发到各放映队。放映小队必须保证放映质量，增加放映场次，既要有重点，也要照顾全面，并且应该特别照顾少数民族地区的需要。文化部艺术事业管理局应该协同文艺界有关各协会推荐适合业余文艺组织演唱的文艺宣传材料，以便出版发行。中央和地方的剧院、剧团和音乐团体要订出具体计划，在春节期间，深入农村或城市郊区巡回演出，并且对群众文艺活动进行辅导。各市、县文化（教）科（局）应该有计划地组织民间职业剧团下乡演出。文化部出版事业管理局应当督促有关出版社及时地出版和大量地供应春节农村宣传材料。各中央一级有关出版社（特别是通俗读物出版社、人民美术出版社）和地方出版社，都应该立即编写以宣传农业合作化运动为中心的通俗小册子以及适合春节农村文艺活动的小型剧本、通俗故事、连环画册、说唱、曲艺、舞蹈等稿件，争取在今年内出版。新华书店应该切实加强农村发行工作。新出版的春节宣传资料，都应该在一九五六年一月份发到支店。人民美术出版社应协同上海电影幻灯机件制造厂制作和发行一批适合春节农村需要的幻灯片，并且从已有的幻灯片中选择一批适用的，推荐给各地文化馆采用。各省、市、自治区文化局（处）应该立即编选演唱材料，大量地印发各地。各省的文艺期刊应该出版春节演唱材料的专辑。各地文化馆、文化站要推动和指导农村俱乐部和其他农村文化组织积极进行群众性的宣传。各公共图书馆可以和文化馆图书室订立合同，做好图书流通工作。文化馆的图书室应该特别注意加强对农村图书室的业务辅导工作，并且要帮助建立农村图书室。文化馆、站应该利用春节文艺活动，发现和收集民间的传统艺术和群众创作材料，以便整理推广。
