    Youth Production Shock Brigades in the Agricultural Cooperation Movement
    Chi Xuewen
    The development of the agricultural cooperation movement requires the Communist Youth League organizations to lead the vast rural youth to play a shock role in the cooperation movement. The rural youth production shock brigades in Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, were established to meet this need.
    A total of 792 youth production shock brigades have been established in Xinjin County, with 11,576 members.
    In June of this year, when the crops were turning green, widespread pests and diseases occurred. "Cutworms," "Satin Mandarin Jackets," and "Cowherds" infested the cornfields, while "Noctuidae" infested soybean and sorghum fields. These pests spread rapidly, and if they were not promptly eradicated, the crops would be missing seedlings and broken rows, affecting the completion of the production increase task. At this time, the county's youth shock brigades, under the leadership of the Party organization, launched a mass insect eradication campaign. The Qingyang First Agricultural Production Cooperative Youth Shock Brigade in Dongdeng Village, Biluhe District, spent six days catching all the pests on the cooperative's land and helped four mutual aid teams establish temporary youth shock brigades to catch pests. Later, the shock brigade members also helped individual farmers Chen Delin and Wang Youjin, who were unable to catch pests, to catch pests. They caught three *dou* of pests in Chen Delin's field and then two *dou* in Wang Youjin's field. Wang Youjin said excitedly, "If it weren't for the youth shock brigade, others would be eating corn in the fall, while I would only have the northwest wind." Qian Yuantai Village in Shahe District did not have a shock brigade in the past. At this time, the six agricultural production cooperatives in the village also organized six temporary youth shock brigades, based on the cooperative, and launched an insect-catching competition. In just three or four days, the pests in the fields were eliminated.
    In mid-July this year, there were several days of torrential rain. The Bilu River in the eastern part of Xinjin County, the Dasha River in the western part, and the Zanzi River and Jia River in the central part were all in danger of breaching their banks. The crops along the banks were severely threatened. The farmers on both sides of the river were uneasy day and night. At this time, the county's youth shock brigades consciously took on this urgent flood control task. Ren Chengpu and Wang Shichang, members of the Fengchan Fourth Agricultural Production Cooperative Youth Shock Brigade in Tucheng Village, Shuangta District, braved the heavy rain at 9 p.m. on July 17 to reinforce the cowshed that was about to collapse. Then, along with twelve shock brigade members, they ran to guard the river dam south of the cooperative. When they reached the dam, they found that the floodwater in one place had already reached the top of the dam, and the dam was about to be washed away. The shock brigade rushed to rescue it, but the soil they piled up was immediately washed away by the flood, and the situation became more and more urgent. At this critical moment, members Wang Shichang, Ren Chengpu, and others immediately lay down to block the breach in the dam, regardless of the danger. All the members fought hard all night before blocking the breach with soil and protecting the rice fields inside the dam. The cooperative members praised the shock brigade's courageous spirit, saying, "The youth shock brigade is like a tiger team; no difficulty is too great for them."
    The youth production shock brigades not only played a shock role in temporary emergency tasks but also played a leading role in ordinary production labor. The shock brigades actively put forward rationalization proposals and suggestions for improving leadership to the cooperative's management committee; or took the lead in responding to the Party's various calls. During the autumn harvest campaign, the county's shock brigades universally studied the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League on Mobilizing Rural Youth to Carry out a Movement to Reduce Grain and Cotton Losses in the Autumn Harvest," and formulated plans to increase production and save resources in light of local conditions. Originally, the members of the Hongxin Third Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xintai Village believed that since the cooperative had so many people and consumed so much, saving small amounts of grain was useless. On the one hand, the shock brigade of this cooperative actively promoted the idea of "accumulating small amounts to make a large amount" to the members; on the other hand, it used its own practical actions to influence the masses. The shock brigade used its spare time to pick up more than fifty *jin* of grain scattered on the ground and displayed it in the cooperative, promoting 142 young people to form two grain-picking shock brigades and six grain-picking shock groups. Finally, all the men, women, old, and young in the village participated in the grain-picking movement. By the end of September, according to statistics from eight districts, rural youth had picked up 154,830 *jin* of grain and 570,148 *jin* of fodder.
    The northern mountainous area of Xinjin County is rich in apples. In previous years, they always suffered heavy losses when encountering wind and rain, and there was also a lot of waste during harvesting. This year, thanks to the active actions of the youth shock brigades, the apple harvest was greatly improved. For example, on the afternoon of September 15, a rainstorm came. More than 10,000 *jin* of apples in the Gao Ligou apple orchard in Wowo Village had not yet been picked from the trees. If they were not harvested immediately, a large number of apples would be lost, but some cooperative members wanted to run home to avoid the rain. At this time, the shock brigade members took the lead in picking apples in the rain, prompting all the cooperative members to pick them together. In one afternoon, they picked more than 5,000 *jin* of apples, reducing the cooperative's losses. During the autumn harvest of fruits, the shock brigade members also proposed to guarantee that no apple would be damaged, which increased the cooperative's income by about 1,240 yuan.
    Who is leading the work of the youth production shock brigades?
    The leadership of the Party organization is the basic guarantee for the healthy development of the youth shock brigades. In the process of building the brigades and after they were established, the Youth League organizations regularly reported the situation to the Party organization and listened to the Party's instructions. When the Youth Shock Brigade of Hongxin Third Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xintai Village was first established, the members had "three fears": first, they were afraid that the cooperative members would say they were "showing off"; second, they were afraid that they would not be paid for doing shock tasks, which would affect their family income; and third, they were afraid that they would lose the glorious title of shock brigade if they did not complete the task. After the Youth League branch reported this situation to the Party organization, the Party organization immediately assisted the Youth League branch in conducting ideological education for the members, fully explaining the significance and purpose of establishing the youth production shock brigade. They educated the members to actively improve their relationship with the cooperative members. On the other hand, the Party organization also discussed with the cooperative management committee to determine the due remuneration based on the labor of the shock brigade. As a result, the members' ideological concerns were dispelled. When the shock brigade made achievements and was praised by the Party organization and the cooperative members, some members developed arrogance and complacency. Wang Xintian, the captain, and others looked down on non-members and elderly cooperative members. The Party organization organized them to study articles in the newspaper against arrogance and complacency and carried out criticism and self-criticism, reversing the complacent mood.
    The Communist Youth League is the specific leader of the youth shock brigades. The Youth League County Committee assigns tasks to the shock brigades, checks their work, and summarizes and exchanges experiences in a timely manner, based on the central tasks of the Party in each period. The Tangjiafang District Working Committee of the Communist Youth League convened a meeting of youth shock brigade captains and Youth League branch secretaries in June this year to exchange experiences in the work of the shock brigades. During the autumn harvest, experience exchange meetings for shock brigade captains were held in sub-districts. Through the exchange of experiences, the Youth League organization truly became the core of the shock brigades.
    In response to the weakness of the members' lack of agricultural technical knowledge, the Youth League County Committee organized the shock brigades and the agricultural technology promotion station to establish a "guaranteed teaching and learning" system, adopting methods such as batch teaching, organizing observation, and technical demonstrations, so that the members learned advanced agricultural farming techniques. In addition, it is necessary to establish necessary systems and disciplines in the youth shock brigades to ensure the victorious completion of tasks.
    In short, carrying out the activities of youth production shock brigades is an effective activity suitable for the characteristics of young people and is a vivid and effective method for strengthening communist education for young people. This work has also enriched the work content of the Communist Youth League and promoted the work of the Communist Youth League in the county.

    农业合作化运动中的青年生产突击队
    迟学文
    农业合作化运动的开展，要求青年团组织带动广大农村青年发挥自己在合作化运动中的突击作用。辽宁省新金县的农村青年生产突击队，就是适应这种需要而建立的。
    新金全县已建立青年生产突击队七百九十二个，共有队员一万一千五百七十六人。
    今年六月，全县正当庄稼禾苗放青的时候，普遍发生了病虫害，苞米地里生了“截虫”、“缎子马褂”和“看牛小”等虫害，大豆、高粱地里生了“夜盗虫”。这些害虫蔓延很迅速，如果不及时扑灭，就会使庄稼缺苗断条，影响增产任务的完成。这时全县青年突击队，在党组织的领导下，发起了一个群众性的灭虫运动。碧流河区东邓村晴阳第一农业生产合作社青年突击队，以六天时间捉光了全社土地上的害虫，并帮助四个互助组成立了临时青年突击队，捕捉害虫。以后，突击队员们又帮助无力捕捉的个体农民陈德林、王有金捕捉害虫。在陈德林的地里捕捉了三斗害虫，随后又在王有金地里捕捉了二斗。王有金激动地说：“要没有青年突击队，到秋后别人吃苞米，我只有喝西北风了。”沙河区前元台村过去没有突击队，这时全村六个农业生产合作社，以社为单位也组织了六个临时青年突击队，展开了捕虫竞赛，只三、四天的时间，就把地里的害虫消灭干净了。
    今年七月中旬，连续几天倾盆大雨。新金县东部地区的碧流河，西部地区的大沙河，中部地区的赞子河和夹河，都有决堤的危险。沿岸的庄稼受到严重的威胁。河两岸的农民日夜不安。这时，全县青年突击队自觉地担负起这一紧急的防汛任务。双塔区土城村丰产第四农业生产合作社的青年突击队员任成璞、王世昌在七月十七日晚间九点多钟冒着大雨抢修将要坍塌的牛圈棚之后，又同十二名突击队员，跑去守护社南河大坝。当他们跑到大坝跟前的时候，就发现一个地方的洪水已经平堰，眼看大坝就要被水冲毁。突击队赶忙抢救，但是堆上泥土，马上被洪水冲走了，情势越来越紧急。在这紧急关头，队员王世昌、任成璞等不顾危险立即躺下挡住坝上的决口。全体队员奋战了整整一夜，才把决口用泥土挡住，保住了坝内的稻田。社员们称赞突击队的勇敢精神说：“青年突击队简直像个猛虎队，天大的困难也难不住他们。”
    青年生产突击队不仅在临时的紧急任务中发挥了突击作用，就是在平时的生产劳动中也起了带头作用。突击队积极地向合作社的社务管理委员会提出合理化建议及改进领导的意见；或者带头响应党的各种号召。秋收运动中，全县突击队普遍地学习了青年团中央“关于发动农村青少年在秋收中开展减少粮食、棉花损耗运动的指示”，结合本地实际情况制定了增产节约计划。原来新台村红新第三农业生产合作社的社员认为合作社大家大口的，节约星星点点的粮食不顶什么用。这个社的突击队一方面积极地向社员进行“积少成多”的宣传；一方面用自己的实际行动去影响群众。突击队利用业余时间就拣回了五十多斤撒在地里的粮食，并在社内进行展览，推动了一百四十二名青年成立了两个拣粮突击队、六个拣粮突击组。最后全村男女老少都参加了拣粮运动。到九月末，据八个区的统计，农村青年们已拣回十五万四千八百三十斤粮食；五十七万零一百四十八斤草料。
    新金县的北部山区盛产苹果，往年遇见风雨总要受到很大损失，同时采摘的时候也有很大浪费，今年由于青年突击队的积极行动，苹果收获量大大提高。例如，九月十五日午后来了暴风雨，瓦窝村高李沟苹果园内还有一万多斤苹果没有下树，不立即抢收，就要损失大量苹果，可是有些社员却想跑回家去避雨。这时突击队员带头冒雨抢摘，推动了全体社员一起抢收。一个晌午就摘回五千多斤苹果，使社内减少了损失。在秋收摘果时，突击队员们还提出保证不损坏一个苹果，这样全社多收入了一千二百四十元左右。
    谁在领导青年生产突击队的工作呢？
    党组织的领导是青年突击队健康发展的基本保证。在建队过程中和队建立起来后，团组织经常向党组织反映情况，听取党的指示。新台村红新第三农业生产合作社青年突击队刚成立的时候，队员有“三怕”：一怕社员说他们是“风头主义”；二怕光搞突击任务自己得不到报酬，影响家庭收入；三怕任务完不成失掉了突击队的光荣称号。团支部把这一情况反映给党组织后，党组织即协助团支部对队员进行思想教育，充分地说明成立青年生产突击队的意义和目的。教育队员积极搞好同社员的关系。另一方面党组织又和社务管理委员会研究按突击队的劳动情况，确定给予应得的报酬。因而，队员们思想顾虑打消了。在突击队作出成绩受到党组织的表扬和社员们的夸奖的时候，一部分队员又滋长了骄傲自满情绪。队长王新田等人，有看不起非队员和老年社员的思想。党组织就组织他们学习报上反对骄傲自满的文章，开展了批评和自我批评，扭转了自满情绪。
    青年团是青年突击队的具体领导者。团县委根据党的每个时期的中心任务，给突击队布置工作，检查工作，及时总结、交流经验。青年团唐家房区工作委员会，在今年六月间召开了全区青年突击队长和团支部书记会议，交流了突击队工作的经验。在秋收中又在区分片召开了突击队长经验交流会。通过交流经验，使团组织真正成为突击队的核心。
    针对队员们农业技术知识缺乏的弱点，团县委组织突击队，同农业技术推广站建立了“包教保学”的制度，采取分批传授、组织观摩和技术表演等形式，使队员们学习了先进的农业耕作技术。另外，在青年突击队中要建立必要的制度和纪律，保证任务的胜利完成。
    总之，开展青年生产突击队的活动，是适合青年特点的有效活动，是对青年加强共产主义教育的生动而有效的方法。这个工作同时也丰富了青年团的工作内容，将全县青年团工作推进了一步。
