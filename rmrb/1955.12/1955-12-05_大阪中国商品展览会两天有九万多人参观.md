    Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, December 3rd: The Chinese Commodities Exhibition in Osaka officially opened on December 1st. In the first two days alone, more than 93,000 visitors came to see it.
    The huge Chinese Commodities Exhibition Hall is built on the banks of the Dojima River in the central district of Osaka. Looking from the opposite bank of the Dojima River, a beautiful and solemn gate tower stands out among the many high-rise buildings. In the evening, the countless lights decorating the gate of the exhibition hall are particularly bright.
    After the Chinese Commodities Exhibition officially opened, every day from 10:00 AM, thousands of visitors streamed into the venue from the streets on both sides of the exhibition hall. People from many cities in western Japan also rushed to visit. People saw more than 3,000 Chinese exhibits here. These exhibits introduced the achievements of China's economic construction, and also included many products that China has historically exported to Japan, such as soybeans, coal, salt, iron sand and other minerals, native products, animal products and food, etc. The people of Osaka felt particularly close to these exhibits because Osaka used to have close trade relations with China.
    The Mayor of Fukuoka City, Kyushu Island, 500 kilometers away from Osaka, Konishi Haruo, and city council members also flew to Osaka on the 2nd to see the exhibition. Konishi Haruo said: "The Fukuoka City Council has already resolved to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese trade. It is regrettable that the Japanese government has adopted an ambiguous attitude towards the issue of restoring diplomatic relations between China and Japan."
    The exhibition's cinema has been open for a week and has already screened ten films, with more than 90,000 viewers.

    大阪中国商品展览会两天有九万多人参观
    据新华社大阪三日电　在大阪举行的中国商品展览会十二月一日正式开放。仅在头两天，前来参观的观众就有九万三千多人。
    巨大的中国商品展览馆建筑在大阪中心区堂岛河畔。从堂岛河对岸望去，一座美丽庄严的门楼耸立在许多高层建筑丛中。一到晚间，展览馆大门上装饰的无数灯光显得特别明亮。
    中国商品展览会正式开放后，每天从上午十时起，成千上万的观众从展览馆两旁的大街川流不息地涌进会场。西日本许多城市的人们也赶来参观。人们在这里看到了三千多种中国展品。这些展品介绍了中国经济建设的成就，同时也包括许多中国历来对日本输出的产品，例如大豆，煤，盐，铁砂和其他矿产，土产，畜产和食品等。大阪的人们对这类展品感到特别亲切，因为大阪曾经与中国有过密切的贸易关系。
    距离大阪五百公里的九州岛福冈市的市长小西春雄和市议会议员等，二日也坐飞机赶到大阪来看展览会。小西春雄说：“福冈市议会已经决议促进中日贸易正常化。日本政府对中日恢复国交问题采取瞹眛态度，是很遗憾的事。”
    展览会电影院开放一星期以来，已经放映了十部影片，观众有九万多人。
