In their joint statement of December 13, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, N.S. Khrushchev, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru expressed the hope that the ambassadorial talks between the United States and the People's Republic of China would not only resolve the issues they discussed, but also achieve broader mutual understanding through higher-level meetings. This is precisely the unanimous desire of people who care about world peace and demand the easing of international tensions.

More than three months ago, when the Sino-American talks reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning home and began to discuss other issues in dispute between the two sides, the Chinese side raised the "embargo issue" and the "issue of preparing for higher-level Sino-American talks." Lifting the embargo is a unanimous demand from countries around the world to develop trade. Holding higher-level Sino-American talks is a practical and feasible way to achieve a peaceful resolution of disputes between China and the United States without resorting to force, especially to ease and eliminate tensions in the Taiwan region. People have reason to demand that the Sino-American talks reach a swift agreement on these two agenda items and make concrete arrangements for higher-level Sino-American talks. However, the U.S. side has been using the pretext of implementing the agreement on the return of civilians to obstruct the progress of the talks, so that the talks have not been able to obtain concrete results on these two agenda items to this day.

After the Sino-American talks reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning home, U.S. officials immediately made public statements, saying that "it would be too early to discuss other issues until the agreed statement on the repatriation of civilians is fulfilled." This extremely unreasonable attitude was met with unanimous condemnation from all sides, and the U.S. side also apparently realized that this unreasonable attitude could not be maintained for a long time, and the talks finally proceeded to the discussion of the second agenda item. However, recently, U.S. officials have once again put forward similar arguments, claiming that before the agreement is fulfilled, the U.S. side will not conduct actual negotiations on other issues in the talks, nor will it participate in any other agreements. Dulles said at a press conference on December 6 that he did not think the Sino-American ambassadorial talks "have made as much progress as people had hoped for." He said, "It is not the lack of progress in the negotiations, but the lack of practical action on the agreements that have been reached." According to him, the agreement reached in the Sino-American talks was: "Americans in China should be able to quickly exercise their right to return home." He said, "To some extent, this has been fulfilled, but not to a sufficient extent." This is clearly an argument to create a pretext for preparing to delay or even interrupt the talks for a long time.

In order to refute this argument that reverses right and wrong, the Spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, in his statement on December 16, fully explained with irrefutable facts that the Chinese side has consistently faithfully implemented the agreement reached by both sides on the issue of civilians returning home in the Sino-American talks; it is the U.S. side that has not fully fulfilled the agreement and has taken actions that violate the agreement.

At the beginning of the Sino-American talks, the Chinese side submitted to the U.S. side a list and information on all Americans in China, giving the U.S. side a clear account. Now, among the general American expatriates in China, all those who are willing to return home have been granted permission to leave the country, and the vast majority have already left China; a small number of people have not left the country because they still have unfinished business, and the Chinese side is doing its best to assist them so that they can settle their unfinished business as soon as possible and return home as soon as possible. Even for Americans who have committed crimes in China, China has also taken lenient measures as quickly as possible in accordance with its own legal procedures, and has released the vast majority of them. For the American criminals who are still imprisoned in China, China is continuing to conduct a case-by-case review.

On the other hand, the U.S. side has not yet submitted to the Chinese side a list and information on all Chinese in the United States. Even among the Chinese whom the U.S. side itself admits have long requested to return home but have been prevented from leaving the country by the U.S. government for a long time, there are still many who have not returned home. The U.S. side has never informed China of the Chinese imprisoned in the United States, nor has it taken any appropriate measures for them. The United States has also openly stated that it cannot assist the Indian side in taking the initiative to understand the situation of the Chinese in the United States and investigating the facts that their departure is being hindered. Not only that, the United States has also directly violated the agreement of the Sino-American talks, further threatening Chinese students in the United States, requiring them to obtain entry permits to Taiwan, in an attempt to prevent them from daring to request to return to the Chinese mainland in the future.

The U.S. side has violated the agreement on the return of civilians in the Sino-American talks, but has groundlessly accused the Chinese side of not fully fulfilling the agreement. Dulles cannot but admit that the current Sino-American talks are not without progress, but Dulles clearly expressed an attempt to use this accusation that reverses right and wrong to further obstruct the progress of the talks, and even undermine the talks, which cannot but arouse people's serious attention.

The Chinese people warmly support the joint statement of the leaders of the Soviet Union and India, and will continue to work to promote the progress of the Sino-American talks and seek broader Sino-American agreements through higher-level meetings. However, the Chinese people also have full reason to demand that the United States should stop its violations of the agreement, abandon its attempts to delay and obstruct the progress of the talks, and make corresponding contributions to the success of the Sino-American talks.

### 美国借口拖延中美会谈

    美国借口拖延中美会谈
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫和印度总理尼赫鲁在十二月十三日发表的联合声明中表示希望：美国和中华人民共和国两国之间的大使级会谈将不仅使得他们所讨论的问题得到解决，而且还将通过更高级的会议达到更广泛的相互谅解。这正是关心世界和平、要求和缓国际紧张局势的人们的一致愿望。
    早在三个多月前，当中美会谈对双方平民回国问题达成了协议，开始讨论双方有所争执的其他问题的时候，中国方面就提出了“禁运问题”和“准备举行更高级的中美会谈问题”。解除禁运是世界各国为开展贸易而提出的一致要求。举行更高级的中美谈判更是实现和平解决中美两国之间的争端而不诉诸武力的原则、特别是和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势的切实可行的途径。人们有理由要求，中美会谈对这两项议题迅速达成协议，为更高级的中美会谈作出具体的安排。但是，美国方面却一直以执行双方平民回国问题的协议为借口，来阻挠会谈的进展，使会谈至今没有能够在这两项议题上获得具体的结果。
    在中美会谈对双方平民回国问题达成协议后，美国官方人员就曾经立即公开声明，“在达成协议的关于遣返平民的声明得到履行之前，讨论其他问题未免为时过早。”这种极端无理的态度遭到了来自各方的一致谴责，美国方面也显然认识到这种无理态度是不可能长期维持下去的，会谈也终于进行了第二项议程的讨论。但是，最近美国官方人员却又提出了类似的论调，声称在协议履行前，美方在会谈中将不对其他问题进行实际的谈判，不参与任何其他协议。杜勒斯在十二月六日的记者招待会上说，他认为中美两国大使级会谈“并没有取得人们所希望的那样良好的进展”。他说，“不是谈判中缺乏进展，而是在已经达成的协议上缺乏实际行动。”据他说，中美会谈已经达成的协议是：“应该让在中国的美国人能够迅速行使他们回国的权利。”他说，“在这方面是履行了一定的程度，可是还没有到充分的程度”。这显然是一种为了准备长期拖延甚至中断会谈制造借口的一种论调。
    为了驳斥这种颠倒是非的论调，中华人民共和国外交部发言人在十二月十六日的声明中就以无可争辩的事实充分地说明了，中国方面一贯忠实地实施中美会谈中双方对平民回国问题所达成的协议；没有充分履行协议、而且采取了违反协议的行为的正是美国方面。
    中国方面在中美会谈开始的时候就向美方提交了全部在中国的美国人的名单和情况，向美方作了清楚的交代。现在，在中国的一般美侨中，凡是愿意回国者，都得到了离境的许可，绝大部分也都已经离开了中国；少数人由于还有未了的事务没有离境，中国方面也正在尽力予以协助，使他们能尽速料理自己的未了事务，早日回国。就是对于在中国犯法的美国人，中国也已经按照自己的法律程序尽速地采取了宽大的措施，释放了其中的绝大部分。对于现在仍然监禁在中国的犯法美国人，中国也正在继续进行着逐个审查的工作。
    另一方面，美方至今没有向中国方面提交全部在美国的中国人的名单和情况。就在美方自己承认早就要求回国而长期被美国政府阻止不能离境的中国人中，至今还有许多人没有回国。美方从来没有向中国交代在美国被监禁的中国人，更没有对他们采取任何适当的措施。美国还公然表示不能协助印度方面主动了解在美国的中国人的情况和调查他们离境受到阻难的事实。不仅如此，美国还直接违反了中美会谈的协议，进一步威胁在美国的中国学生，要求他们取得台湾入境证，企图使他们在将来不敢要求回到中国大陆。
    美国方面违反了中美会谈关于双方平民回国的协议，却还毫无根据地指责中国方面没有充分履行协议。杜勒斯也不能不承认，当前的中美会谈并不是没有进展，但是杜勒斯却明显地表示企图用这种颠倒是非的指责来进一步阻挠会谈的进展，甚至于破坏会谈，这就不能不引起人们严重的注意。
    中国人民热烈支持苏联和印度两国国家领导人的联合声明，并且将继续为促进中美会谈的进展和通过更高级的会议谋求更广泛的中美协议而努力。但是，中国人民也有充分的理由要求，美国应该终止违反协议的行为，放弃拖延和阻挠会谈进展的企图，为中美会谈的成就作出相应的贡献。
