Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 15th: The last three of the nine projects that a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Engineering Corps and Chinese Aid-Korea construction workers helped the Korean people build in Pyongyang this year were completed on December 10th. In recent days, representatives from the construction department of the Korean government have satisfactorily inspected the new buildings. On December 14th, the Ministry of Construction of the Korean Cabinet held a meeting at the Moranbong Theater in Pyongyang to bid farewell to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Engineering Corps troops and some of the Chinese experts who will be returning home.

    The unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Engineering Corps came to Pyongyang at the beginning of the Korean War armistice to help the Korean people with their reconstruction efforts. Over the past two years, they and the Chinese Aid-Korea construction workers have built 33 new projects in Pyongyang, including the joint office building of the Cabinet's various ministries, and restored nine major projects such as the Datong River pedestrian railway bridge. The total construction area reached 200,7572 square meters.

    When helping the Korean people with various construction projects, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Engineering Corps troops and the Chinese Aid-Korea construction workers strived to implement the construction policy of "good, fast, and economical" and conscientiously adhered to the principle of "cherishing every tree and nail in Korea" during construction.

    据新华社平壤十五日电  中国人民志愿军工程兵某部和中国援朝建筑工人，今年帮助朝鲜人民在平壤市建设的九项工程中的最后三项，已经在十二月十日全部完成。最近几天，朝鲜政府建设部门的代表满意地验收了各个新的建筑物。十二月十四日，朝鲜内阁建设省在平壤牡丹峰剧场举行了大会，欢送即将离开平壤的中国人民志愿军工程兵部队和一部分将要回国的中国专家。
    中国人民志愿军工程兵某部是在朝鲜停战初期就来到平壤市帮助朝鲜人民进行恢复重建工作的。两年多来，他们和中国援朝建筑工人一起在平壤市新建了内阁各省联合办公厅大楼等三十三项工程，恢复了大同江人行铁桥等九项大工程。总建筑面积达到二十万零七千五百七十二平方公尺。
    中国人民志愿军工程兵部队和中国援朝建筑工人，在帮助朝鲜人民进行各项建设时，努力贯彻了“好、快、省”的施工方针，并在施工中切实做到了“爱护朝鲜的寸木一钉”。
