    Inspect the Service Attitude of the Shanghai Railway Bureau
    Tang Shuping
    The high tide of agricultural cooperation has arrived. All departments of our state organs should warmly care about this major event and provide assistance as much as possible. The railway transportation department bears a significant responsibility for the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and should be more concerned and assist in agricultural cooperation. However, some railway bureaus have not fully valued this work.
    More than two years ago, the supply and marketing cooperative newly established near Jianqiao Station, which belongs to the Shanghai Railway Bureau, wrote to Chairman Mao, saying that Jianqiao Station disliked the cooperative's consignment plan as not being correct and not as straightforward as private merchants. Therefore, they were happy to transport vegetables for private merchants but not very happy to transport vegetables for cooperatives. Of the vegetables shipped from Jianqiao Station, 70 percent were consigned by private merchants. Moreover, the station was dissatisfied with the cooperative and often did not allocate vehicles in a timely manner, causing many vegetables to rot. In the ten days from June 21 to June 30, 1953 alone, farmers suffered a loss of more than 12,800 yuan due to untimely vegetable transportation.
    More than two years have passed since the Jianqiao Station incident. Although the Shanghai Railway Bureau has made some improvements in this area, such as starting to help agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives formulate consignment plans and helping them to strive to achieve them, due to the mechanical implementation of national transportation policies and the presence of departmentalism and irresponsibility in transportation work, it still cannot better serve agricultural production.
    The national transportation policy stipulates that the principle of cargo transportation is: public before private, major before minor, planned before unplanned. According to a correct understanding, these three aspects should be interconnected and inseparable, and should be considered uniformly and comprehensively in the work. Only in this way can it be beneficial to the country and to socialist construction. However, the Shanghai Railway Bureau is not like this. They only pay attention to the "planned before unplanned" aspect, while ignoring the other two aspects. Therefore, they refuse to transport some goods that are not within their plans but are of great importance to agricultural production and the lives of farmers. For example, last winter, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives negotiated with Puzhen Station to consign more than 600 packages of fertilizer to supply agricultural production cooperatives. However, because it was not included in the plan in advance, the Nanjing Transportation Branch of the Shanghai Railway Bureau refused to transport it. As a result, the Federation of Cooperatives had to pay more freight and time to transport it by wooden boat. This year, the peak season arrived earlier, and in order to meet the needs of the masses for cloth, the Shanghai Purchasing Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation requested the Shanghai Railway Bureau to relax the transportation of materials outside their plan in August. However, the Shanghai Railway Bureau did not pay attention to this opinion, resulting in a temporary disconnection of cloth supplies in Hunan, Anhui and other provinces.
    Departmentalism is also quite serious in various departments of the Shanghai Railway Bureau. They often affect cargo transportation in order to complete their own work targets. Last year, Shanghai East Station (the largest freight station of the Shanghai Railway Bureau) shortened the time vehicles stayed in the station. One time when loading wheat, they drove the car away with two or three hundred kilograms of wheat still not loaded. Sometimes the tarpaulin on the car was not covered properly and the ropes were not tied properly before the car moved. Even among the loading and unloading teams at the station, there is this kind of departmentalism. In order to load quickly and get more piece-rate wages, they only pick the easy-to-load goods to load first, pushing the difficult-to-load goods to the next shift. This year in March, a large batch of double-wheeled double-furrow plows shipped from Hefei to Shanghai, and transferred from Shanghai to Wenjiazhen and Yingtan, was delayed in Shanghai for seven days because of this.
    There are also many transportation accidents caused by sloppy work and failure to follow regulations. In February of this year, dozens of cars of rice seeds were transported from Shanghai East Station to Hefei, Chuxian and other stations. Because the station weigher did not comply with the regulations, 618 packages of rice seeds were damaged by moisture. In August of this year, Shanghai East Station had thirteen cars of fertilizer transported to Wuxi. The staff of Wuxi Station even gave one car belonging to the Wuxi City Cooperative to a county cooperative, causing difficulties for the Wuxi City Cooperative in the supply of fertilizer.
    Why do the above-mentioned problems arise? This is mainly because they do not understand the nature and tasks of the railway transportation industry sufficiently, only seeing the city and not the countryside, thinking that the railway only serves socialist industrialization. In the spring of 1954, although the units under the Shanghai Railway Bureau also concentrated on publicizing the country's general tasks to their employees, because they did not closely link it to the actual situation in railway transportation, the subsequent work could not all meet the requirements of the general tasks. In addition, some leaders are arrogant and complacent, and often do not sincerely help solve the specific difficulties of the consigning departments, but excessively complain and inappropriately criticize, so naturally it is impossible to do a good job.
    Now, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Party Committee of the Shanghai Railway Bureau is inspecting its work in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and is drawing up a comprehensive plan for future work. It is hoped that the leaders of the Shanghai Railway Bureau can pay attention to the shortcomings mentioned above, conscientiously improve their work, and make railway transportation better serve socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    检查上海铁路管理局的服务态度
    汤树屏
    农业合作化高潮已经到来。我们国家机关各个部门，都应当热忱地关怀这件大事，并且尽可能地给予帮助。铁路运输部门担负着城乡物资交流的重大责任，更应当关心并协助农业合作化。但是有些铁路管理局还没有充分重视这个工作。
    两年多以前，上海铁路管理局所属的笕桥车站附近新建立起来的供销合作社，写信给毛主席，说笕桥站嫌合作社的托运计划做得不正确，不及私商来得爽快，所以高兴替私商运蔬菜，不大高兴替合作社运蔬菜。从笕桥站运出的蔬菜中，有百分之七十是私商托运的。而且车站不满意合作社，常常不及时拨给车辆，因而蔬菜烂掉很多。仅在一九五三年六月二十一日至三十日的十天中，农民因蔬菜运输不及时而受的损失，就有一万二千八百多元。
    从笕桥站事件到现在已经两年多了。上海铁路管理局在这方面的工作虽然也有了一些改进，例如他们开始帮助农业生产合作社和供销合作社制定托运计划，并且帮助他们努力实现。但是，由于机械地执行国家运输政策，在运输工作中有本位主义和不负责任现象，还不能更好地为农业生产服务。
    国家运输政策规定货物运输的原则是：先公后私、先主要后次要、先计划内后计划外。按照正确的理解，这三个方面应该是互相联系而不可分割的，在工作中应该统一地、全盘地加以考虑。只有这样，才能够对国家和对社会主义建设有好处。但是，上海铁路管理局不是这样。他们只注意到了
  “先计划内后计划外”这一点，而忽视了其他的两个方面。因此，一些虽然不在他们计划之内但是对农业生产和农民生活有很大关系的货物，他们就拒不运输。例如，去年冬天，全国合作总社向浦镇车站交涉托运六百多包肥田粉，准备供给农业生产合作社。但是，因为事先没有订入计划，上海铁路管理局南京运输分局就不给运输。结果，合作总社不得不付出更多的运费和时间来用木船运送。今年旺季到来较早，为了满足群众对纱布的需要，中国花纱布公司上海采购站曾要求上海铁路管理局能在八月份对他们计划以外的物资运输放宽一些。可是，上海铁路管理局没有重视这个意见，以致湖南、安徽等省的布匹供应一度发生脱节现象。
    上海铁路管理局各部门中的本位主义思想也相当严重。他们经常为了完成本单位的工作指标而影响货物运输。去年，上海东站（上海铁路管理局最大的货运站）为了缩短车辆在站停留时间，有一次装运小麦，还有二、三百斤小麦没有装上去，就把车子开走了。有时车子上的雨布还没有盖好，绳子还没有捆好，车子就动了。甚至在车站的装卸班组之间也有这种本位主义思想。为了装得快多拿计件工资，他们就净拣好装的货物先装车，把难装的推给下一班。今年三月份从合肥运到上海，由上海中转运到温家圳和鹰潭去的一大批双轮双铧犁，就是因为这样在上海压了七天。
    因工作草率和不按照规章办事而招致的运输事故也是不少的。今年二月，从上海东站运到合肥、滁县等站稻种数十车，因为车站司磅员不遵守规章，使得六百一十八包稻种受到湿损。今年八月，上海东站有十三车肥田粉运到无锡，无锡车站的工作人员竟把无锡市合作社的一车也交给了一个县的合作社，造成了无锡市合作社在肥田粉供应上的困难。
    为什么会产生上面所说的一些问题呢？这主要是他们对铁路运输业的性质和任务了解不够，只看到城市，看不见农村，以为铁路就光为社会主义工业化服务。一九五四年春天，上海铁路管理局所属单位，虽然也集中地向职工们进行了国家总任务的宣传，但是，因为没有很好地联系到铁路运输中的实际情况，以后的工作还不能都符合总任务的要求。加上部分领导人员骄傲自满，对于托运部门的具体困难常常不是诚恳地去帮助解决，而是过多地埋怨和不恰当地指责，自然也就不可能把工作做好。
    现在，在中共上海市委的领导下，上海铁路管理局党委正依照中共七届六中全会（扩大）决议的精神，来检查自己的工作，并且拟出今后工作的全面规划。希望上海铁路管理局领导上能注意到上面所提到的一些缺点，认真改进自己的工作，使铁路运输更好地为社会主义建设和社会主义改造服务。
