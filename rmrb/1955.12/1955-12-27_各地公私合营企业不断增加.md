Reports from our newspaper indicate that since November, a large number of private industrial and commercial businesses across the country have implemented joint state-private ownership. Many regions have progressed from implementing joint state-private ownership in individual enterprises to implementing it in all or most enterprises within an industry.

In Beijing, 126 private factories in nine industrial sectors, including flour, electrical machinery, and knitwear, have implemented joint state-private ownership across their respective industries. Combined with the 29 joint state-private factories established on a trial basis over the past two years, the output value of joint state-private factories in the city already accounts for more than 40% of the total output value of private industries with more than ten employees. Recently, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee also approved the implementation of joint state-private ownership across the private commercial sectors of Chinese medicine, new medicine, tea, and mineral oil.

The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee recently approved the implementation of joint state-private ownership across the private factories in the industrial sectors of dyes, pen manufacturing, paint manufacturing, iron and steel smelting, and shipbuilding. Thus, a total of thirteen private industrial sectors in the city have implemented joint state-private ownership across their respective industries. All private retail stores in eleven sectors, including woolen yarn, cotton cloth, and radio, as well as international trade businesses in Shanghai, have also been approved by the People's Government to implement joint state-private ownership since mid-November. In addition, the two private transportation industries of inland river steamers and port barges have also recently implemented joint state-private ownership across their respective industries.

In Tianjin, eight private industrial sectors, including rubber, knitwear, carts, and dyes, and three private retail sectors, including new medicine and cotton cloth, have successively implemented joint state-private ownership across their respective industries. Many factories in the cotton textile and knitwear industries have already drafted their production plans for 1956. In addition, a number of private grain consignment stores have been transformed into state-owned grain store outlets.

In Jiangsu Province, private factories in the three industries of silk reeling, woolen textile, and cement across the province have recently all implemented joint state-private ownership. By the end of this year, the output value of joint state-private factories across the province will reach half of the total output value of private industry. The seven industrial sectors of iron and steel machinery in Nanjing, the two commercial sectors of cotton cloth and general merchandise, as well as the cotton textile industry in Wuxi, have also recently implemented joint state-private ownership across their respective industries.

In other areas, such as the private silk reeling and cotton spinning industries in Zhejiang Province, the nine industrial sectors of porcelain clay and bakelite in Anhui Province, the six industrial sectors of cigarettes and papermaking in Jinan City, Shandong Province, as well as the machine printing and dyeing, glass, and cotton cloth industries in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, and the private cotton cloth and general merchandise stores in Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, have also recently implemented joint state-private ownership across their respective industries.
