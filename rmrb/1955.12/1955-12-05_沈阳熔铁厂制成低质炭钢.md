    Shenyang Iron Smelting Plant Produces Low-Quality Carbon Steel
    The workers of the local state-owned Shenyang Iron Smelting Plant successfully trial-produced low-quality carbon steel for smelting high-quality steel, using steel scraps from state-owned factories. Technical appraisal proves that this low-quality carbon steel is of better quality than the scrap steel used in the past by state-owned steel plants when smelting high-quality steel. It has a higher yield and can also shorten the smelting time. Currently, the Shenyang Iron Smelting Plant is building a new low-quality steel workshop, which is expected to produce 30,000 tons of low-quality carbon steel for the country next year, creating at least 4.35 million yuan of wealth for the country. This can supply the national steel plants with more than 27,000 tons of high-quality steel, which can be used to produce 135 heavy-duty machine tools or 355 kilometers of heavy steel rails. Recently, the Metal Recycling Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has signed a contract with the plant, deciding to supply a large amount of shavings during the first five-year plan, and uniformly supply the low-quality carbon steel produced by the plant to steel plants in Dalian, Benxi, and Fushun.

    沈阳熔铁厂制成低质炭钢
    地方国营沈阳熔铁厂职工利用国营工厂的钢铁切屑，试制供冶炼优质钢用的低质炭钢成功。经技术鉴定，证明这种低质炭钢比过去国营钢厂熔炼优质钢的时候，所采用的废钢材的质量要好，收得率高，还能缩短冶炼时间。目前沈阳熔铁厂正在新建一个低质钢车间，预计在明年可为国家生产三万吨低质炭钢，至少可为国家创造四百三十五万元的财富。能供国家钢厂炼出二万七千多吨优质钢材，用这些优质钢材可以生产出一百三十五个重型机床或三百五十五公里长的重钢轨。最近重工业部金属回收管理局已经同这个厂订立了合同，决定在第一个五年计划内大量供应刨屑，并且统一把这个厂生产的低质炭钢，供应大连、本溪、抚顺等钢厂使用。
