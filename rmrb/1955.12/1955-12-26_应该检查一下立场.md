A Check on Stance Is Needed
　　After the report by Chairman Mao “On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation” was disseminated in Tiansheng Village, Liangcheng County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, five poor peasant households took the lead in initiating the establishment of an agricultural producers' cooperative in the village. They ran around, promoting and mobilizing, for half a month. How happy they were to see the agricultural cooperative about to be established! Who knew that on the day the agricultural cooperative was established, when the list of cooperative members was read out, their names were not on it. What was the reason for this? It is said that it was because they were too poor to pay the membership fund and investment.
　　Such examples are not isolated in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In Sanjianfang Township, Tuoketuo County, seven poor peasant households were not allowed to join the cooperative because the township party branch secretary thought they were too poor. Yang Er, a poor peasant in Datuchengzi Township, Jining County, was also squeezed out of the cooperative. He said sadly: "Mutual aid teams don't want us, and cooperatives don't want us either. Those who can join the cooperative will live, and those of us who can't join will die!"
　　Why are some staff members still excluding poor peasants from joining the cooperatives? Haven't they seen Chairman Mao's instructions? No, they have all studied them, and they have also been discussed at district and township cadre meetings. But why do they still exclude poor peasants from joining the cooperatives? Their stance should be checked.

    应该检查一下立场
    内蒙古自治区凉城县天胜村，在毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告传达下来以后，有五户贫农首先在村里发起建立农业生产合作社。他们每天东跑西串，宣传动员，忙了半个月，眼看着农业合作社要建立起来了，他们多高兴呀！谁知道，在农业合作社成立那天，一念社员名单，没有他们的名字。这是什么原因呢？据说是因为他们太穷了，缴不起入社的股份基金和投资。
    像这种例子在内蒙古自治区不是个别的。托克托县三间房乡就有七户贫农，因为乡支部书记认为他们太穷，不能入社。集宁县大土城子乡贫农杨二也被排挤在社外了。他悲愤地说：“互助组不要，合作社更不要。入社的活吧，咱们这些不能入社的苦死吧！”
    为什么到现在，还有工作人员在排斥贫农入社呢？是他们没看到毛主席的指示吗？不是的，他们都学习过，区、乡干部会上也讲过。可是，为什么他们还要排斥贫农入社呢？应该检查一下他们的立场。
