The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held a symposium on December 9th to exchange views on the issue of uniting and transforming intellectuals, and determined the preliminary guidelines for carrying out the work. The symposium was presided over by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. Participants included some Central Committee members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Beijing, heads of various work departments, and some senior intellectuals among the members.

In their speeches, the participants unanimously agreed that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals is entirely correct. In Chinese history, intellectuals have never been able to fully utilize their expertise and strength as they have since liberation. Under the Party and the government's kind concern and education, intellectuals' ideological understanding has generally progressed and improved over the past few years, and they have made certain contributions to the cause of national construction.

The symposium believed that the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang takes former Kuomintang members and upper-middle-class individuals who have historical ties with the former Kuomintang as its main targets for uniting, educating, and transforming. Many of these people possess certain specialized knowledge and skills. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang at all levels should immediately take measures to deeply understand their situations and the problems that exist, strengthen the work on them according to the requirements of the country, so that they can fully exert their potential and enthusiasm and better serve the socialist cause.

The Central Council of the China Association for Promoting Democracy recently held a series of meetings to discuss the issue of uniting and transforming intellectuals.

These meetings were respectively presided over by Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and Zhou Jianren, Vice Chairman. More than 20 people attended the meetings, including central council members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy in Beijing, heads of various departments, and some representative senior intellectuals among the members.

At these meetings, everyone unanimously agreed that in the current new situation of further development of agricultural cooperation and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, intellectuals' thinking must be further transformed in order to fully exert their potential and better serve the socialist cause. The China Association for Promoting Democracy has the responsibility to assist the Chinese Communist Party and the government in deeply understanding the current situation of intellectuals' lives, studies, and work.

After discussion, the meeting decided to issue a notice to local organizations, requesting them to conduct in-depth investigations and research on the lives, studies, and work of representative members and the masses they are connected with, in a focused and planned manner, within the next month.

    民革中央委员会和民主促进会中央理事会
    分别讨论知识分子的团结和改造问题
    中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会在十二月九日举行座谈会，就知识分子的团结和改造问题交换了意见，并确定了进行工作的初步方针。座谈会由民革主席李济深主持，参加座谈的有民革部分在京中央委员、各工作部门负责人和成员中部分高级知识分子。
    参加座谈的人在发言中，一致认为中国共产党和人民政府对知识分子的团结和改造的方针是完全正确的，在中国历史上，知识分子从来没有像解放以来这样能够充分发挥他们的专长和力量；而知识分子在党和政府的亲切关怀和教育下，几年来，思想认识一般都有了进步和提高，对国家建设事业作出了一定的贡献。
    座谈会认为，民革是以原国民党员和同原国民党有历史关系的中上层人士为团结、教育、改造的主要对象，其中不少人是具有一定的专门知识和技术的。民革各级组织应即采取办法，深入了解他们的情况和所存在的问题，根据国家的要求，加强对他们的工作，使他们能够充分发挥潜力和积极性，更好地为社会主义事业服务。
    中国民主促进会中央理事会最近连续召开会议，讨论知识分子的团结和改造问题。
    这几次会议分别由民主促进会主席马叙伦、副主席周建人主持。参加会议的有民主促进会在京中央理事、各部门负责人和会员中的一部分有代表性的高级知识分子等二十多人。
    在这几次会议上，大家一致认为：在目前农业合作化和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造进一步发展的新形势下，知识分子的思想必须作进一步的改造，才能充分发挥潜力，更好地为社会主义事业服务。民主促进会有责任协助中国共产党和政府，深入地了解目前知识分子的生活、学习和工作等各方面的情况。
    会议经过讨论以后，决定向各地方组织发出通知，要求各地方组织在最近一个月内，有重点、有计划地对有代表性的会员和所联系的群众的生活、学习和工作等各方面情况，进行深入的调查研究。
