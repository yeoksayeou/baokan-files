    Yunnan Holds Conference of Anti-Illiteracy Activists
    The Yunnan Provincial Department of Education and the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League convened the Provincial Conference of Anti-Illiteracy Activists from December 15th to 21st. The conference was attended by 538 anti-illiteracy activists from ethnic groups including Han, Hui, Miao, Dai, Jingpo, and Naxi. Among them were League cadres who led the successful operation of people-run schools, teachers who actively overcame difficulties to run people-run schools, young men and women who studied diligently and achieved remarkable results, as well as demobilized soldiers and graduates of higher primary and junior high schools who performed well in anti-illiteracy work. The attending youth unanimously passed various proposals for eliminating illiteracy in the vast rural areas of Yunnan Province within seven years.
