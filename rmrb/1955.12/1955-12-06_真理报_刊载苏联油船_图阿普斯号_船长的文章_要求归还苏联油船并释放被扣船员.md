Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 5th: "People's Daily" published an article on the 4th by V. Galinin, captain of the Soviet tanker "Tuapse."

The article stated: We spent thirteen months in the Kuomintang's torture chambers. During this period, neither mental nor physical torture could destroy the will of the Soviet people.

On the second day after the "Tuapse" tanker was hijacked, the Soviet government resolutely protested against the Kuomintang bandit gang's piratical acts on the high seas, demanding the immediate release of the oil tanker and its crew. The packages sent by the Soviet government through the French government were a major source of encouragement for all the crew members of the "Tuapse" tanker. We received these packages with tears in our eyes. They were very precious to us, like a mother's care for her children, symbolizing the motherland.

The firm stance of the Soviet government, supported by all the people, resulted in the release of twenty-nine sailors from the Kuomintang. However, other comrades are still suffering torture to this day. This means that the Kuomintang bandit gang and their American protectors are unwilling to abandon their piratical plans to undermine international law. Merchant ships of other countries, including Britain, have also been attacked in the Taiwan area. This situation is a serious obstacle to further improving the international situation. The Soviet people and all peace-loving people cannot compromise with this situation. We once again loudly and resolutely protest against this shameless action of the Kuomintang bandit gang, demanding the release of our comrades, the return of the "Tuapse" tanker and the cargo on board.

    “真理报”刊载苏联油船“图阿普斯号”船长的文章
    要求归还苏联油船并释放被扣船员
    据新华社莫斯科五日电　“真理报”四日发表了苏联油船“图阿普斯号”的船长维·加里宁的一篇文章。
    文章写道：我们在国民党的刑室里过了十三个月。在这段时期内，无论是精神上的还是肉体上的折磨都不能摧毁苏维埃人的意志。
    在“图阿普斯号”油船被劫夺的第二天，苏联政府就坚决抗议国民党匪帮在公海上的海盗行为，要求立刻释放油船和船员。苏联政府经由法国政府送来的包裹对于“图阿普斯号”油船的全体船员是一个重大的鼓舞力量。我们含着眼泪收下这些包裹。它们像是象征着祖国对自己儿女的母亲般的关怀一样，对于我们是非常宝贵的。
    得到全体人民支持的苏联政府的坚定立场，使得二十九名海员从国民党手中释放出来。但是，其他的同志一直到现在还在受着折磨。这意味着国民党匪帮和他们的美国保护人不愿意放弃破坏国际公法的海盗计划。在台湾地区遭到攻击的还有包括英国在内的其他国家的商船。这种情况是进一步改善国际局势的严重的障碍。苏联人民和一切爱好和平的人民是不能和这种情况妥协的。我们再次大声坚决抗议国民党匪帮的这种无耻行动，要求释放我们的同志们，归还“图阿普斯号”油船和船上的货物。
