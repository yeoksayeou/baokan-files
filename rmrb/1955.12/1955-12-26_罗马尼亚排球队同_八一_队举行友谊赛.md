    Romanian Volleyball Team Holds Friendly Match with "August 1st" Team
    The Romanian national men's volleyball team, which is currently visiting Beijing, lost to the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" men's volleyball team by a score of 0-3 in a friendly match on the afternoon of the 25th.
    The friendly match was held in the competition hall of the Beijing Gymnasium. More than 6,000 spectators attended on the 25th, and they applauded enthusiastically for the wonderful performances of the athletes from both countries from time to time.
    Both teams fielded their strongest players.
    After the first game started, the "August 1st" team was once at a disadvantage with a score of 1-5 because of a spike that went out of bounds and several unsuccessful receptions of the powerful balls served by the Romanian team using hook serves. The "August 1st" team paused to discuss countermeasures and strengthened its blocking, eventually catching up to a score of 6-6. At this point, the Romanian team also called a timeout. Afterwards, the Romanian team scored two more points, but the "August 1st" team quickly caught up again to 8-8. Subsequently, due to continuous errors in receiving the ball by the Romanian team, the "August 1st" team took the lead with a score of 11-8. After the Romanian team changed players, the game became a back-and-forth battle, with the two sides fighting for the serve as many as fifteen times. When the score reached 14-10 with the "August 1st" team in the lead, the Romanian team changed players again. However, at this critical moment, the "August 1st" team scored another point, winning the first game with a score of 15-10.
    After the two sides switched courts, the second game began. The "August 1st" team took an early lead of 5-0. In this situation, the Romanian team called another timeout. After the serve, S. Roman and H. Nicolau launched a fierce attack, and their spikes were very powerful, adding great difficulty to the "August 1st" team's reception. The "August 1st" team then used three players to jump up and block at the same time, thus blocking many hard balls spiked by the opponent. In the subsequent games, the "August 1st" team successfully applied offensive tactics such as "pulling apart" and "cross cover", first using one player to jump up and pretend to spike, diverting and confusing the opponent's blocking attention, and then another player jumped up and quickly spiked the ball down, thus scoring more and more points. Although the Romanian team changed players four times, they still lost with a score of 6-15.
    In the first few minutes after the start of the third game, the "August 1st" team was again at a disadvantage with a score of 0-5 due to continuous spiking and receiving errors. Later, the Romanian team's powerful long-range spikes and rapid two-touch plays often caught the "August 1st" team off guard, thus increasing the score to 7-1 and 9-4. In this situation, the "August 1st" team did not let go of any offensive opportunities. Wu Limin, Jiang Zhenhong and Li Ce all successfully spiked several hard balls, thus catching up to a stalemate of 10-10, 11-11 and 13-13. At this time, every point scored by either side was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience. Finally, the "August 1st" team scored two more points in a row, winning again with a score of 15-13.

    罗马尼亚排球队同“八一”队举行友谊赛
    正在北京访问的罗马尼亚国家男子排球队二十五日下午在一场友谊比赛中，以零比三败给中国人民解放军“八一”男子排球队。
    这场友谊比赛是在北京体育馆的比赛馆中举行的。二十五日到场的观众有六千多人，他们不时为两国运动员的精采表演热烈鼓掌。
    两队都以最强的队员出场。
    第一局比赛开始以后，“八一”队因为扣球出界和几次没有顺利地接起罗马尼亚队用钩手发过来的极有力的球，所以一度以一比五处在不利地位。“八一”队暂停商量了对策，加强了拦网以后，一直追到六平。这时候，罗马尼亚队也叫了暂停。以后，罗马尼亚队又多得了两分，但是“八一”队很快地又追到了八平。此后，罗马尼亚队因为连续接球失误，“八一”队反以十一比八领先。罗马尼亚队调换了队员以后，比赛形成了拉锯状态，双方争夺发球权达十五次之多。打到十四比十“八一”队领先的时候，罗马尼亚队又调换了一次队员。但是在这个紧要的关头，“八一”队又得了一分，以十五比十先胜第一局。
    双方交换了场地以后，展开了第二局比赛。“八一”队在比赛开始后不久，就以五比零领先。在这种情况下，罗马尼亚队又叫暂停。开球以后，斯·罗曼和霍·尼科劳就展开了猛烈的进攻，他们扣的球非常有力，给“八一”队接球的时候增加了很大的困难。“八一”队这时候利用三个队员同时跳起来封网，因此挡回了对方扣过来的许多硬球。“八一”队在以后的比赛中成功地应用了“拉开”和“交叉掩护”等进攻战术，先用一个队员跳起来装做扣球的样子，转移和迷惑了对方封网的注意力，然后由另一个队员跳起来迅速地把球扣下去，因此得分就越来越多。罗马尼亚队虽然四次调换队员，但是最后仍以六比十五失败。
    在第三局比赛开始后的最初几分钟内，“八一”队因为连续扣球和接球失误，又以零比五处在不利的地位。后来，罗马尼亚队的有力的远网扣球和迅速的两下球，又经常使“八一”队来不及防守，因此使比分增加到七比一和九比四。“八一”队在这种情况下没有放松进攻的机会，伍理民、江振洪和李策大扣了几个硬球都很成功，因此追成了十平、十一平和十三平的僵持局面。这时候双方每得一分，观众中就响起了热烈的掌声。最后，“八一”队又连得了两分，以十五比十三再一次得到胜利。
