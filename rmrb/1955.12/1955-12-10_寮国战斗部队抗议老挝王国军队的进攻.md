    Lao Fighting Units Protest Attacks by Royal Lao Army
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th - According to a Vietnam News Agency report: On December 6th, the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Units in Vientiane wrote to the International Commission for Laos, protesting the Royal Lao Army's attacks on the Lao Fighting Units near Baka and Na Nong in Sam Neua at the beginning of December.
    The letter emphasized that this attack by the Royal side once again demonstrates that the Royal Government is intentionally carrying out increasingly large-scale military offensives in the two provinces, and is unwilling to sincerely negotiate to resolve all political issues.
    The letter finally requested the International Commission to take effective measures regarding the above-mentioned actions of the Royal Government, urging the Royal Government to immediately cease the offensive and withdraw its troops that have illegally entered the two provinces.

    寮国战斗部队抗议老挝王国军队的进攻
    新华社河内九日电　据越南通讯社消息：十二月六日，在万象的寮国战斗部队政治代表团写信给老挝国际委员会，抗议老挝王国军队在十二月初向桑怒的巴卡和那农附近的寮国战斗部队进攻的行动。
    信中强调说，王国方面的这次进攻，再一次说明王国政府有意地向两省进行规模愈来愈大的军事进攻，不肯诚恳地进行协商以解决一切政治问题。
    信中最后要求国际委员会对王国政府上述行动采取有效的措施，促使王国政府立即停止进攻和撤出他们非法进入两省的军队。
