    Further improve the work of transforming capitalist industry and commerce
    Wuhan silk and cloth merchants are about to implement joint state-private ownership of the entire industry
    Our reporter Cao Baoming
    Private silk and cloth merchants in Wuhan are brewing for joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, planning to prepare for unified management before the end of the year, and officially implement joint state-private ownership starting from January next year.
    At the beginning of last year, there were still 37 private silk and cloth merchants in Wuhan with labor-capital relations, with a total of more than 1,200 employees. Many of these stores were poorly managed, had excessive expenses, and had very bad business styles. Jianghan Silk and Cloth Company, the largest in terms of capital, saw its turnover increase year by year, but its expense ratio was as high as 18 percent, resulting in losses every year. This company had more than 100,000 yuan of working capital, but due to two rushes to purchase rainproof cloth and summer cloth, nearly half of the funds were tied up, and it often had to borrow 40,000 to 50,000 yuan from the bank. After the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth in September last year, the number of farmers entering the city to buy cloth decreased, and the turnover of the entire private silk and cloth industry declined. Eleven silk and cloth shops closed down, one switched to another industry, and three merged. Many of the remaining 23 shops also found it difficult to maintain operations. At that time, some capitalists hoped that the business would collapse as soon as possible so that they could "go their separate ways," and the thoughts of the shop assistants were also very confused.
    Under the guidance of the policy of "overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement," the commercial departments of Wuhan have done a lot of work in the past year or so. Among the merchants in the entire industry, two have become joint state-private shops, three have become consignment shops, and eighteen have become distribution shops. Each store has established a democratic management and store affairs management system, improved business management, and implemented a job grade wage system. Employees actively carried out a frugality campaign. By the end of last year, 20 private stores had saved more than 310,000 yuan in expenses. Many stores that could not maintain operations in the off-season, such as Dazhong, Yufeng, Gongping, and Youwei, could be maintained. The Wuhan Cooperative also abolished 11 silk and cloth retail departments in order to better arrange for private merchants. The Wuhan Company of China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation also made arrangements for each store based on market needs and the income and expenditure of each store. In addition to implementing full consignment sales for the three stores that could not maintain operations, partial consignment sales of goods were also implemented for the eight distribution stores that had difficulty in maintaining operations, helping them increase the variety of goods in order to increase turnover. For some stores that could not complete their business plans, state-owned companies introduced them to sell social public cloth. After these arrangements, each store overcame the difficult period and had some surplus in the first three quarters of this year.
    However, there are still many problems among the silk and cloth merchants in Wuhan. First of all, there is an imbalance between households. Due to the different degrees of socialist transformation of joint state-private shops, consignment shops, and distribution shops, and the different credibility among consumers, there are also great differences in business. Last year, except for September, each private silk and cloth merchant failed to complete the business plan every month, and the entire industry only had a total surplus of more than 5,000 yuan for the whole year. However, the joint state-private Qianxiangyi Silk and Cloth Store still overfulfilled the business plan every month, with a surplus of 42,000 yuan for the whole year. Zhicheng Consignment Store and Tongfu Distribution Store both had surpluses. This imbalance is also reflected between large and small households. This requires state-owned companies to spend a lot of effort to help small and backward households maintain their business, but the problem cannot be solved in the long term.
    Second, private silk and cloth merchants in Wuhan have little capital and many stores, and the capital is scattered. Therefore, to maintain these stores, the state needs to lend funds, while some stores with more funds cannot fully utilize them. The city's silk and cloth merchants have a total of 410,000 yuan in working capital, and two joint state-private stores account for 230,000 yuan. They also occupy 300,000 yuan of state funds. Many private stores rely on state funds to maintain operations. At the same time, state-owned companies make arrangements every month in order to maintain a certain turnover for private stores, creating their dependence and failing to give full play to the positive factors of private capital. On the contrary, some stores, after continuous assistance from the state, are unwilling to operate according to the state plan and are unwilling to accept socialist transformation once their business improves.
    Third, the distribution of the commercial network is unreasonable, cannot meet the needs of consumers, and creates difficulties in business. Most of the private silk and cloth shops in Wuhan are concentrated in three places: Jiefang Bridge in Wuchang, Minquan Road in Hankou, and Jianghan Road. There are no private silk and cloth shops above Qiaokou Station Road and below Hanyang in Hankou. The two family stores, Huikang and Dong Zhengmao in Wuchang, are located opposite Yufeng Cloth Store and the department store's retail department. Yufeng Cloth Store earned more than 9,000 yuan in the first half of this year, while Huikang lost money. This makes it necessary for state-owned companies to add new stores in many areas without silk and cloth shops, while also trying to maintain difficult households.
    If these fundamental problems are not resolved, the burden on state-owned companies will become heavier and heavier, and the goal of "comprehensive arrangement" cannot be achieved. However, to solve the problem of imbalance between households, it is necessary to implement the method of large leading small and advanced leading backward; to solve the problem of scattered capital and give full play to the positive factors of private capital, it is necessary to merge some silk and cloth shops and strengthen the leadership of the state-owned economy; to adjust the commercial network, it is necessary to comprehensively plan and relocate in a planned manner. These problems cannot be solved by capitalists operating independently. For example, to merge operations, profitable households are afraid of being implicated by difficult households and are unwilling to merge with them. If difficult households merge with difficult households, the difficulty still cannot be solved. There are also many concerns about the relocation problem. Only after joint state-private ownership of the entire industry can these problems be solved on the basis of unified business management and unified calculation of profits and losses in the entire industry. Only after joint state-private ownership of the entire industry can the enthusiasm of the employees of each store be further brought into play and the transformation of capitalists can be strengthened. Some capitalists of medium and small stores also see that although their stores have become distribution and consignment stores and are on the road of state capitalism, they can still maintain or have a slight surplus at present, but they will have difficulties again in the off-season and must be further transformed into a higher form of state capitalism. Therefore, after studying the experience of the silk and cloth industry in Beijing, the silk and cloth merchants in Wuhan began to brew for joint state-private ownership of the entire industry. Individual capitalists who believe that there is still profit to be made and are unwilling to implement joint state-private ownership are also persuaded by mobilization within the capitalists, see the trend of social development, and are willing to implement joint state-private ownership of the entire industry. Twenty-one private silk and cloth shops in the city are jointly applying to the government for joint state-private ownership of the entire industry.
    The Wuhan Municipal Commercial Administration Department has decided that the Wuhan Company of the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation will directly lead the work of these stores. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation analyzed the specific situation and planned to conduct unified business management of the entire industry after the entire industry is merged, based on "overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement." They also plan to uniformly adjust the commercial network according to the needs of Wuhan's construction and development in order to do a good job in supplying consumers.

### 进一步做好改造资本主义工商业的工作  武汉绸布业座商即将实行全行业公私合营

    进一步做好改造资本主义工商业的工作
    武汉绸布业座商即将实行全行业公私合营
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    武汉市私营绸布业座商正在酝酿全行业公私合营，计划在年底以前作好统一经营的各项准备工作，明年一月起正式公私合营。
    去年年初，武汉市私营绸布业中还有三十七户有劳资关系的座商，共有从业人员一千二百多人。这些商店很多是管理不善、费用过高，经营作风很恶劣的。资金最大的江汉绸布公司，几年来营业额逐年上涨，但是费用率高达百分之十八，年年有亏累。这个公司有十多万元流动资金，因为两次抢购防雨布和夏布，积压了将近一半的资金，经常要向银行借款四、五万元。去年九月实行棉布统购统销后，农民进城买布的减少，私营绸布业全行业营业额下降。先后有十一户绸布店停业，一户转业，三户合并，剩下的二十三户中也有许多户难以维持。那时有的资本家希望营业早垮台，可以“各奔前程”，店员的思想也十分混乱。
    武汉市商业部门在贯彻执行“统筹兼顾，全面安排”的方针下，一年多来曾做了许多工作。全行业座商中有两户成为公私合营商店、三户成为代销店、十八户成为经销店。各店都建立了民主管理和店务管理制度，改进了经营管理，实行了职务等级工资制。职工们积极开展了节约运动。到去年年底，二十户私营商店就节约费用三十一万多元。许多在淡季中不能维持的商店，如大中、裕丰、公平、有为等家，都可以维持。武汉市合作社还撤消了十一个绸布门市部，以便更好地安排私商。中国花纱布公司武汉市公司又根据市场需要和各商店收支情况，进行逐户安排。除对不能维持的三户实行全部代销外，对八户维持有困难的经销店也实行部分商品代销，帮助他们增加货物的花色品种，以提高营业额。对一些不能完成营业计划的商店，国营公司介绍他们销售社会公用布。这样安排后，各店渡过了困难时期，并且在今年前三个季度都有些盈余。
    但是，武汉市绸布座商中还有很多问题，首先是户和户之间不平衡。由于公私合营店、代销店和经销店接受社会主义改造的程度不同，对消费者的信誉也不同，因此在营业上也有很大差别。去年一年，除九月份外，各私营绸布座商月月不能完成营业计划，全年全业总共只盈余五千多元。但是，公私合营谦祥益绸布店仍然月月超额完成营业计划，全年盈余四万二千元。志成代销店、同孚经销店都有盈余。这种不平衡也表现在大户小户之间。这就要国营公司花费很大力量来帮助小户、落后户维持营业，而问题还是长期不能解决。
    第二是武汉市私营绸布座商是资金少店户多，资金分散，因此要维持这些商店就需要国家贷给资金，而有些资金多的又不能充分发挥作用。全市绸布座商共有流动资金四十一万元，两家公私合营商店就占有二十三万元，他们还占用了国家资金三十万元。许多私营商店都要靠国家资金来维持。同时国营公司为了维持私营商店一定的营业额，月月进行安排，造成他们的依赖思想，不能发挥私人资本的积极因素。相反地，一些商店经过国家不断帮助，营业一旦好转后，就不愿按照国家计划营业，不愿接受社会主义改造。
    第三是商业网分布得不合理，不能适应消费者的需要，而且造成了营业上的困难。武汉市私营绸布店多集中在武昌解放桥、汉口民权路和江汉路等三处，汉口桥口以上车站路以下，以及汉阳都没有私营绸布店。武昌的惠康、董正茂两户家庭商店就开设在裕丰布店和百货公司门市部对面，裕丰布店今年上半年就赚了九千多元，而惠康却赔了钱。这就使得国营公司一方面要在许多没有绸布店的地区增设新店，一方面还要想办法维持困难户。
    这些根本问题不解决，国营公司的负担就越背越重，而且不能达到“全面安排”的目的。但是，要解决户和户之间的不平衡问题，就必须实行以大带小、以先进带落后的办法；要解决资金分散和发挥私人资本的积极因素的问题，就必须把一些绸布店合并经营，并且加强国营经济的领导；要调整商业网，就必须全面规划，有计划迁移。这些问题都不是各店资本家独自经营所能解决的。例如要合并经营，盈余户怕受困难户牵累，不愿同他们合并。如果困难户和困难户合并，困难还是不能解决。对搬迁问题顾虑也很多。只有全业公私合营后，在全业统一经营管理、统一计算盈亏的基础上，才能解决这些问题。也只有全业公私合营后，才能进一步发挥各店职工的积极性，加强对资本家的改造工作。一些中、小店的资本家也看到自己的商店虽然已经成为经销、代销店，走上国家资本主义的道路，目前还能维持或稍有盈余，但是一到淡季就又有困难，必须进一步改造为国家资本主义的高级形式。因此，武汉市绸布业座商在学习北京绸布业的经验后，就开始酝酿全业公私合营。个别认为目前还有利可图而不愿公私合营的资本家，也在资本家内部动员说服下，看清社会发展的趋势，愿意全业公私合营。全市二十一户私营绸布店，正联名向政府申请全业公私合营。
    武汉市商业行政部门决定由国营花纱布公司武汉市公司直接领导这些商店的工作。花纱布公司分析了具体情况，计划在全业合营后，在“统筹兼顾，全面安排”的基础上，进行全行业统一经营管理。他们还按照武汉市建设发展的需要，计划统一调整商业网，以作好对消费者的供应工作。
