    Break Down Conservative Thinking in Industrial Production with Facts
    Shí Xīn
    In his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," Comrade Mao Zedong used the term "bound feet woman" to describe comrades whose thinking lagged behind reality, who could not see that the high tide of cooperation had already arrived or was about to arrive, and who were "swaying from side to side, always complaining to others: go faster, go faster." Such "bound feet women" exist not only in the agricultural cooperation movement but also in industrial production and construction. If we do not oppose the "bound feet women" in industrial production and construction, and if we do not break down conservative thinking in industrial production and construction, our industrialization cause cannot advance rapidly.
    Those with conservative thinking always see only the negative factors or the difficult side of the work, and fail to see the positive factors and the favorable side of the work, especially the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses in building socialism. To effectively break down conservative thinking, we must present convincing facts, so that people not only see the negative factors in the work, but also see the positive factors, and especially see that: as long as we are good at developing the positive factors, we can overcome all negative factors. The news and communication published by the Beijing Workers' Daily on December 17 concerning the drafting of the 1956 production plan of the Harbin Linen Factory is a good example of using facts to break down conservative thinking. In the news and communication, the Workers' Daily tells people the following:
    When the Harbin Linen Factory was drafting the 1956 production plan, most of the middle-level administrative and technical personnel initially believed that the control targets set by the Textile Industry Ministry's Flax, Ramie and Silk Bureau were "too rash." For example, Yang Kun, the director of the weaving workshop, believed that it was "impossible" to increase the number of looms tended by workers from twelve cotton and linen interweaving machines to sixteen next year. Zhou Hesheng, the director of the preparation workshop, also felt that it was "impossible" to expand the number of spindles each worker tends from ten to thirteen.
    Is it really "too rash," "impossible," and "unachievable"? The newspaper continued, when the issue was brought to the factory's Party Committee, the Party Committee decided to let the workers express their opinions on the issue. At the symposiums of advanced workers and veteran workers held in various workshops, the workers expressed their opinions one after another. Gu Minshu, the foreman of the weaving workshop, said: The reason why the workers in the weaving workshop are not tending many machines now is mainly because advanced experience has not been promoted; if we promote advanced experience well, let alone tending sixteen machines, tending twenty machines is also possible. Xing Yuqing from the preparation workshop criticized the director of the workshop, Zhou Hesheng, saying: How can you only see the half that fails to complete the task! In fact, more than half of the workers are already tending thirteen spindles. The workers cited many facts to show that the targets set by the bureau were not unachievable, but could be exceeded.
    The newspaper tells us that after the draft of the 1956 production plan of the Harbin Linen Factory was discussed by all the staff and workers, all the indicators were greatly improved compared with the original control indicators set by the Textile Industry Ministry's Flax, Ramie and Silk Bureau. According to the current indicators, the factory will produce more than 1.36 million feet of linen next year, accumulating more than 2.72 million yuan of funds for the country. The staff and workers of this factory not only put forward many rationalization proposals for improving production during the plan drafting process, but also, in order to ensure the completion of next year's plan, they actively took action from the first day of plan drafting to learn technology, promote advanced experience...
    Anyone who has read these two reports will feel that the conservative thinking of some people in the early stage of the Harbin Linen Factory's plan drafting is completely unfounded. Anyone who has read these two reports will also feel that the factory's plan is relatively advanced, but also completely realistic. Its realism lies in the fact that it is based on the most reliable foundation of the socialist enthusiasm of the working masses. It should be said that the report published by the Workers' Daily is a very powerful criticism for those who are content with the status quo, stick to conventions, and cannot see the soaring socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of workers. The Workers' Daily cited this example in the editorial "Overcome Conservative Thinking and Compile Advanced Plans" published on the same day, which made this editorial even more powerful.
    At present, both the agricultural cooperation movement and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are advancing at an unprecedented speed. Under this new situation of socialist construction and socialist transformation, industrial construction must also accelerate. This requires our newspapers to fight against all kinds of conservative thinking in industrial construction. In this regard, the practice of the Workers' Daily is very worthy of promotion.

### 用事实来打破工业生产上的保守思想

    用事实来打破工业生产上的保守思想 
    湜辛
    毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中，曾经用“小脚女人”来形容那些思想落后于实际，看不到合作化的高潮已经或即将到来的形势的同志，说他们“东摇西摆地在那里走路，老是埋怨旁人说：走快了，走快了。”像这样的“小脚女人”，不但在农业合作化运动中有，在工业生产建设上也有。不反对工业生产建设上的“小脚女人”，不打破工业生产建设上的保守思想，我们的工业化事业也就不可能迅速地前进。
    有保守思想的人总是只看到工作中的消极因素或困难的一面，而看不到工作中的积极因素和有利的一面，特别是看不到广大群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造性。要有效地打破保守思想，就要拿出富有说服力的事实，让人们不只是看到工作中的消极因素，更要看到积极因素，特别是要看到：只要我们善于发扬积极因素，就能够克服一切消极的因素。北京工人日报十二月十七日发表的关于哈尔滨亚麻厂编制一九五六年生产计划草案的消息和通讯，就是用事实来打破保守思想的一个比较好的例子。工人日报在消息和通讯中告诉人们这样一件事情：
    当哈尔滨亚麻厂编制一九五六年生产计划草案的时候，起初大多数中层行政人员和技术人员都认为纺织工业部毛麻丝局规定的控制指标“太冒进”。例如织布车间主任杨琨认为，明年要使工人从看十二台棉麻交织机增加到十六台，“是不可能的事”。准备车间主任周荷生也觉得，要让每个工人从看十个锭子扩大到十三个锭子，“是做不到的”。
    真是“太冒进”、“不可能”、“做不到”吗？报纸继续写道，当问题被提到这个厂的党委会以后，党委会决定让工人群众也来对这个问题发表意见。在各车间召开的先进工人和老工人座谈会上，工人们纷纷表示了自己的意见。织布车间工长顾民枢说：织布车间工人现在所以看台不多，主要是因为先进经验没有推广；要是好好推广先进经验，不要说看十六台，看二十台也可以。准备车间的邢玉清批评车间主任周荷生说：你怎么只看见完不成任务的那一半呢！实际上现在已经有一半以上的工人看到十三个锭子了。工人们举出许多事实说明了局里订的指标不是完不成，而是可以超过的。
    报纸告诉我们，哈尔滨亚麻厂一九五六年的生产计划草案经过全体职工讨论以后，各项指标都比纺织工业部毛麻丝局原来规定的控制指标有了很大的提高。按照现在的指标计算，这个厂明年将多生产亚麻布一百三十六万多尺，为国家多积累二百七十二万多元的资金。这个厂的职工群众不只是在计划编制过程中提出了许多改进生产的合理化建议，并且为了保证明年计划的完成，从编制计划的第一天起，就积极行动起来，学习技术，推广先进经验……。
    看过这两篇报道的人，谁都会觉得，像哈尔滨亚麻厂编制计划初期某些人的保守思想是毫无根据的。看过这两篇报道的人，谁也会感到，这个厂的计划是比较先进的，但又是完全现实的。它的现实性就在于它是建立在工人群众的社会主义积极性这个最可靠的基础之上的。应当说，工人日报发表的这个报道对于那些安于现状、墨守成规和看不到广大工人高涨的社会主义热情的人，是一个十分有力的批评。工人日报在同一天发表的“克服保守思想，编制先进计划”的社论中援引了这个例子，这就使得这篇社论更加有力量。
    现在不论是农业合作化运动和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作，都在以空前的速度前进着。在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的这种新形势下，工业建设也必须加快速度。这就要求我们的报纸同工业建设中的各种各样的保守思想作斗争。在这一方面，工人日报的做法是很值得提倡的。
