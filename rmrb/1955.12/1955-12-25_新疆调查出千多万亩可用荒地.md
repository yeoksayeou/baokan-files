The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Wasteland Survey and Design Bureau dispatched two general survey teams, four survey teams, and three land planning and design teams this year. They have now surveyed over 14 million mu of wasteland, exceeding the original plan. Soil analysis has proven that 11.97 million mu of this wasteland is usable.

In terms of wasteland survey and design, this year's task is mainly to meet the needs of establishing large-scale military reclamation farms. Currently, the surveyed area has reached 4.02 million mu, exceeding the plan by 80.22%. The planning and design work for thirteen large-scale military reclamation farms has also been completed, with a total cultivated area of more than 1.92 million mu. At present, these farms are using new agricultural machinery for land reclamation, canal construction, and land leveling. Some newly reclaimed land has already been sown with winter wheat for the first time. Before the end of the year, the planning and design of 680,000 mu of land for six military reclamation farms will also be completed. The annual planning and design task will also be greatly exceeded. Next year, all nineteen farms can be planted with grain and cotton.

    新疆调查出千多万亩可用荒地
    新疆维吾尔自治区荒地勘测设计局今年派出的两个概查队、四个勘测队和三个土地规划设计队，现在已经调查出一千四百多万亩荒地，超过了原定计划。经土壤化验证明，这些荒地中有一千一百九十七万亩可以利用。
    在荒地的勘测设计方面，今年的任务主要是满足建立大面积军垦农场的需要。现在，勘测面积已达四百零二万亩，超过计划百分之八十点二二；十三个大面积军垦农场的规划设计工作也已经完成，耕地面积共为一百九十二万多亩。目前，这些农场正在用新式农业机械，进行开垦、修渠、平地工作；有些新垦荒地，已经第一次播种了冬麦。在年底以前，还能完成六个军垦农场六十八万亩土地的规划设计。全年的规划设计任务，也将大大超过。明年，这十九个农场就可以全部种上粮食和棉花。
