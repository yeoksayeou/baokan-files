Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, December 17th:

    Mr. Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen:
    We thank the Government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan for inviting us to visit Afghanistan, a country friendly to the Soviet Union, and we thank the Kingdom's Government for its warm welcome and gracious hospitality.
    The long-standing friendship between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan has been tested throughout the entire period since the birth of the Soviet state and independent Afghanistan. This friendship has continuously strengthened at each stage of its development, which is in the interests of both Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. We can now state with deep satisfaction that good neighborly and friendly relations exist between our two countries.
    The Soviet-Afghan Treaty of February 2, 1921, and the Treaty of Neutrality and Non-Aggression of June 24, 1931, were of great importance in consolidating the friendly relations between our two countries.
    Our relations are also based on mutually beneficial economic cooperation, which is reflected in the development of Soviet-Afghan trade relations. The Soviet-Afghan Trade and Payments Agreement signed in 1950 played a role in promoting this.
    This year, the Soviet Union and Afghanistan signed an agreement on transit issues, which is of great significance for the development of Afghanistan's foreign trade relations and the consolidation of its economic independence. This agreement gives Afghan merchants broad opportunities to access foreign markets.
    In its dealings with Afghanistan, the Soviet Union has always been guided, and will continue to be guided, by the principles of respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence, and economic cooperation.
    We hope that our personal contacts with Afghan leaders will promote the further development and consolidation of Soviet-Afghan relations. The exchange of views on issues of mutual concern indicates that both countries are willing to more broadly develop the multifaceted ties between our two countries.
    We are pleased to note that the people of Asia and Africa, since rising up against the colonial system, have made significant achievements in recent years in gaining and consolidating their national independence. However, the colonialists are still exhausting all means to force the liberated people of various countries to accept the systems favored by the colonialists in the new environment.
    Now, they are doing everything possible to disguise their colonial policies, trying to bind some countries in Asia and Africa with new forms of treaties and conventions, and pull them into all sorts of aggressive military blocs against peace and the security of all nations.
    The Soviet Union has always opposed colonialism, no matter what form it takes. We sympathize with the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa for national independence. We have never hidden this in the past, and we do not hide it now.
    The Soviet Union highly values Afghanistan's peace-loving independent foreign policy and its policy of opposing the establishment of blocs, as well as its desire to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors and all other countries.
    We express our sympathy for Afghanistan's policy on the Pakhtunistan issue. The Soviet Union advocates a just resolution of the Pakhtunistan issue. This issue cannot be correctly resolved without considering the vital interests of the people living in Pakhtunistan.
    The people of all countries are committed to maintaining peace. We believe that a policy of neutrality and non-alignment is most conducive to ensuring the security of the people of all countries and safeguarding the interests of their national independence, and contributes to consolidating the cause of peace.
    We express our hope that the Afghan government will continue its efforts to strive for the maintenance and consolidation of peace.
    We wish His Majesty the King of Afghanistan good health.
    May the friendship between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan be increasingly consolidated and developed.
    Long live peace and security for the people of all countries!

### 布尔加宁的讲话

专栏：

    布尔加宁的讲话首相先生阁下，各位先生：
    我们感谢阿富汗王国政府邀请我们来访问对苏联友好的阿富汗，并且感谢王国政府对我们的热情欢迎和殷勤款待。
    苏联和阿富汗多年的友谊已受过从苏维埃国家和独立的阿富汗诞生以来这一整段时期的考验。这种友谊在它的各个发展阶段上不断地加强，这是符合阿富汗和苏联利益的。现在我们可以深深满意地指出，在我们两国之间存在着睦邻和友好关系。
    一九二一年二月二日的苏联—阿富汗条约和一九三一年六月二十四日的中立和互不侵犯条约在巩固我们两国友好关系方面具有重要意义。
    我们的关系还以互利的经济合作为基础，这在苏联和阿富汗贸易关系的发展上表现了出来。一九五零年签订的苏阿贸易支付协定对这一点起了促进作用。
    今年，苏联和阿富汗签订了关于过境问题的协定，这个协定对于阿富汗对外贸易关系的发展和巩固它的经济独立有重大的意义。这个协定使阿富汗商人得到了进入国外市场的广泛机会。
    苏联在同阿富汗相处当中，始终本着，今后仍将本着尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处和经济合作的原则。
    我们希望，我们同阿富汗领导人之间的个人接触将促使苏阿关系进一步发展和巩固。就互相有关的问题交换意见的情况表明，两国都愿意更广泛地发展我们两国之间多方面的联系。
    我们愉快地指出，亚非国家的人民自从起来反对殖民制度以后，最近几年已经在取得和巩固自己的民族独立方面获得了重大的成就。但是，殖民者还在用尽手段，想在新的环境中还要强迫解放了的各国人民接受殖民者所喜欢的制度。
    现在，他们在千方百计地替自己的殖民政策加上伪装，想用新形式的条约和公约把亚洲、非洲的某些国家束缚起来，把它们拉进反对和平和各国人民安全的各式各样的侵略性军事集团。
    苏联一贯反对殖民主义，不管它采取什么形式。我们同情亚非各国人民争取民族独立的斗争。对于这一点，我们过去从来不隐瞒，现在也不隐瞒。
    苏联对阿富汗爱好和平的独立外交政策和它反对建立集团的政策的态度，以及它同邻国和其他所有国家保持友好关系的愿望，都给予崇高的评价。
    我们对阿富汗在解决巴克同尼斯坦问题上的政策表示同情。苏联主张公正地解决巴克同尼斯坦问题。不考虑居住在巴克同尼斯坦的人民的切身利益，这个问题是不可能得到正确解决的。
    各国人民都致力维护和平。我们认为，中立和不参加集团的政策最有利于保障各国人民安全和维护他们国家的独立的利益，并且有助于巩固和平事业。
    我们表示希望：阿富汗政府继续努力为争取维护和巩固和平而斗争。
    我们祝阿富汗国王陛下健康。
    祝苏联和阿富汗的友谊日益巩固和发展。
    世界各国人民的和平和安全万岁！
        （新华社据塔斯社喀布尔十七日电）
