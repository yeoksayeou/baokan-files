    The Vendors are Organized
    By our reporter Shen Wenying
    The Dongsi People's Market in Beijing is a market concentrated with vendors. There are 935 vendors in the market, including 36 industries such as cotton cloth, general merchandise, stationery, ceramics, second-hand clothing, and second-hand books. From April this year to now, a quarter of the vendors have been organized, forming fifteen joint purchase and sale groups composed of fifteen industries including cotton cloth, general merchandise, stationery, old books, and shoe uppers.
    The characteristic of vendors is that they only have a small amount of capital, and use their labor to share part of the task of social commodity circulation and supply consumer needs, which is the positive aspect that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The vendors in Dongsi People's Market mainly supply nearby residents with daily necessities, cotton cloth, general merchandise, and even pots, bowls, ladles, spoons, needles, threads, clothes, and hats. However, they are also private owners, with characteristics such as being scattered, backward, and conservative, and their business ideology and business style are capitalist in nature. Although the Beijing Municipal People's Government strengthened management at the beginning of the market's establishment and stipulated that goods should be sold at clearly marked prices, the old business style still existed for a long time. A few vendors even used inferior goods to impersonate good goods, and used round-headed rulers to measure cloth to shortchange customers. At the same time, the vendors' funds are limited, and they have to go to the market for small handicraft products and state-owned companies to purchase goods almost every day, which affects business hours. Moreover, there are many households in the same industry, and each household has to purchase some goods that general consumers need, so the commodities they operate are similar to each other, and the variety of patterns is extremely incomplete. In addition, the cost of retail purchases is high, so the selling price is high, and the result of blindly competing for profits increases the burden on consumers. Things are expensive and the variety of patterns is incomplete, so customers are naturally unwilling to buy. Especially since last year, in order to better rationally allocate industrial and agricultural products to supply consumer needs, state-owned commerce has replaced the business of private wholesalers and controlled the source of major commodities. The commodities originally purchased by vendors on credit in the free market have been restricted, and the variety of commodities has become less and less. This has gradually reduced the vendors' turnover, and the number of households losing money has increased month by month. Taking cotton cloth vendors as an example, since the state implemented planned supply of cotton cloth in September last year, all the cotton cloth vendors in the market have become distributors of state-owned companies. However, there are many households, and the average capital of each household is less than 600 yuan. In addition to purchasing a batch of blue, blue, white, and gray cloth, they have no power to purchase high-quality and novel cloths. Most vendors only have twenty or thirty kinds of commodities, and customers cannot choose suitable cloth, so business is getting less and less every day. Although the Municipal Cotton Yarn Cloth Company Supply Station and the Commercial Section of the Dongsi District People's Committee help them calculate accounts and think of ways to maintain their business every month, and take care of them by distributing more best-selling goods and cloth heads without cloth tickets. However, the vendors' own weaknesses have not been overcome, so in the first quarter of this year, fifteen of the eighteen vendor households still lost money.
    In view of the difficulties in the operation of vendors, the staff of the Commercial Section of the Dongsi District People's Committee and the Dongsi District Supply Station of the Municipal Cotton Yarn Cloth Company often publicize the benefits of organizing to the vendors. At that time, Li Ziyang, a representative of the Dongsi District People's Congress and a member of the Dongsi People's Market Vendors Federation, and Jin Yongnian, the leader of the cotton cloth vendor group, proposed to the government to organize joint purchase and sale. The District People's Committee decided to first use cotton cloth vendors as a pilot to organize joint purchase and sale groups. However, because each household has different amounts of funds, different business quality, different numbers of family members, and different income and expenditure, their attitudes towards joint operation are different. The entire process of organizing joint purchase and sale is a process of struggle between collectivist ideology and scattered and backward ideology. Among the eighteen vendor households, except for two households who actively took the lead, eleven of them had small funds, few customers, poor management ability, and poor location, and their business could not be maintained. They felt that after being organized, everyone would find ways to solve the difficulties, and they all actively supported the organization of joint purchase and sale. Four households had more funds, good locations, sold more money, had less expenditure, and could generally maintain their business, so they had many concerns. Vendor Sun Yingzhou said: "My stall has a good location, and business can be maintained. What if it collapses after joining? If I don't participate, and everyone is organized, wouldn't they squeeze me out?" He was in a dilemma and hesitated. There were also individual households who resolutely refused to participate. For example, vendor Li Duanran had 1,500 yuan of funds, had a house at home, and his children all had jobs, so he could live well without doing business, so he resolutely refused to participate, and also publicized everywhere: "It's impossible to do business well with a dozen households together..."
    In response to these situations, the staff of the Commercial Section of the Dongsi District People's Committee and the Dongsi District Supply Station of the Municipal Cotton Yarn Cloth Company, under the leadership of the Dongsi District Committee of the Communist Party of China, started by organizing and leading vendors to discuss and solve issues such as wages, capital investment dividends, and care and subsidies for households in difficulty, to eliminate various ideological concerns. They temporarily stipulated that in the first three months after the joint operation, wages would be calculated at 35 yuan per person per month, and after three months, democratic evaluation would be conducted based on work ability. The issue of paying dividends on capital investment was of concern to households with more funds. Sun Yingzhou said: "I have a lot of money, and it's enough to eat for three years. What if I suffer after joining?" After everyone's research, the method of paying interest on shares was temporarily adopted, and a certain amount of dividends was paid every month, so that those with more funds were relieved of their concerns. Some vendors had large families and could not maintain the minimum standard of living with only wages or dividend income, so everyone decided to give them a certain subsidy. In order to do a good job in subsidizing, the vendors organized an investigation team to investigate the living and income and expenditure of each household. After self-reporting expenses and democratic evaluation, the subsidies for households in difficulty were determined, and it was decided to appropriately change or reduce the subsidies based on the income of each household after the evaluation of wages after three months. In addition, it was also stipulated that a portion of the net profit would be set aside as a public welfare fund to be used for subsidies for unexpected events such as illness, old age, and death. The District Commercial Section also helped them discuss and formulate organizational rules and regulations, and stipulated specific systems and methods. Except for Li Duanran, who resolutely refused to participate in joint purchase and sale, the remaining seventeen cotton cloth vendors began joint operation on April 1 this year.
    The establishment of the cotton cloth joint purchase and sale group pointed out the direction for the vendors in the entire market. Starting in July this year, fourteen industries, including general merchandise, stationery, electrical materials, shoe uppers, old books, and ceramics, learned from the experience of the cotton cloth industry joint purchase and sale group and successively established preparatory groups for joint purchase and sale to prepare for joint operation. Under the leadership of the District Commercial Section, collective education was emphasized, and the concrete examples of the cotton cloth joint purchase and sale group were used to illustrate the benefits of organizing. Some individual vendors, on the one hand, promoted that there was no freedom after joint operation, and on the other hand, bought fur coats, radios, and made new clothes. A few vendors superficially agreed to joint operation, but secretly made false accounts and tried to withdraw funds. The preparatory group for joint operation promptly criticized and educated them. Those who were unwilling to participate in joint purchase and sale were allowed to operate independently; those who resisted or sabotaged joint operation were decided not to be absorbed into the group for a certain period of time. By the beginning of September, fifteen joint purchase and sale groups were established.
    In the short months since the organization of joint operation, it has shown great superiority. Many vendors who were unwilling to participate in joint operation in the past or were not temporarily absorbed into the group, seeing the benefits of organizing, have applied to participate.
    After joint purchase and sale, funds can be concentrated for use, which can increase the variety of goods purchased and overcome the shortcomings of purchasing fewer varieties of goods in the past when operating in a decentralized manner. For example, after the joint operation of the cotton cloth industry, more than 140 kinds of commodities have been added. Commodities such as corduroy, double-sided khaki, and seersucker, which were not able to be purchased in the past, can now also be added. Before the joint operation, vendors had little capital and difficulty in turnover, and had to run to companies and markets to purchase goods every day, wasting a lot of freight. After the joint operation, there is a business accounting group, and special personnel purchase goods in batches and uniformly. The freight in the first month was reduced by 83.92%. In the past, the vendors' operating expenses and family expenses were mixed together. They spent more when they earned more, spent less when they earned less, and ate their savings when they lost money. After the income was fixed after the joint operation, waste was overcome. The knitting, general merchandise, and enamel groups reduced their expenses by 39.22% in September compared with August. Many groups had surpluses in the first month of joint operation. For example, the cotton cloth industry lost 60 yuan in March, and the whole group earned a net profit of 580 yuan in April, which initially changed the uneven situation of hardship and happiness. With more funds, the proportion of purchasing goods from state-owned companies has gradually increased; gradually increased, while maintaining the original varieties and patterns of operation to meet the different needs of consumers. In this way, on the one hand, the business is brought into the track of the national plan, which is convenient for state-owned companies to transform them; on the other hand, their original operating characteristics are maintained. After the organization of joint operation, the vendors have initially changed their business style, and generally sell goods at the listed prices of state-owned companies. For commodities that state-owned companies do not have listed prices for, they can also appropriately lower the prices to make the prices reasonable and satisfy customers. Many agencies, groups, and citizens are willing to come to the market to buy things. For example, the staff of Beijing Municipal Fifth Hospital bought 27 rolls of cotton cloth at one time.
    The joint purchase and sale group has also established various systems, mainly improving the accounting system and setting up special accounts. Fifteen joint purchase and sale groups have opened accounts at the Municipal People's Bank. These groups have also established systems such as going to and from work, asking for leave, and studying, which are convenient for organizing studies and further transforming them ideologically.
    The fifteen joint purchase and sale groups in Dongsi People's Market have set an example for the vendors in the entire market. Now, 164 vendors in five industries, including bicycle parts, new shoes, leather suitcases, sweaters, and clothing, are applying for joint operation. The joint purchase and sale groups in the general merchandise category are applying to merge into a large joint purchase and sale group.
    Facts show that organizing vendors to jointly purchase and sell in markets with concentrated vendors is feasible. This organizational form is suitable for the current economic foundation and level of awareness of vendors, and creates good conditions for further socialist transformation of vendors.

    摊商组织起来了
    本报记者　沈文英
    北京市东四人民市场是个摊商集中的市场。场内共有摊商九百三十五户，包括棉布、百货、文具、陶瓷、估衣、旧书等三十六个行业。从今年四月到现在，已经有四分之一的摊商组织起来，成立了包括棉布、百货、文具、旧书、鞋面等十五个行业组成的十五个联购联销小组。
    摊商的特点是仅有少数资金，用自己的劳动来分担一部分社会商品流转的任务，供应消费者的需要，这是它有利于国计民生的积极方面。东四人民市场的摊商，主要是供应附近居民一些日用必需品，棉布、百货以至锅、碗、瓢、勺，针、线、衣、帽，样样都有。但是他们又是私有者，有分散、落后、保守等特点，他们的经营思想和经营作风是资本主义性质的。虽然在市场建立的初期，北京市人民政府就加强了管理，规定实行明码标价售货，但是旧的经营作风依然长期存在。少数摊商还以次货抵好货，用圆头尺量布克扣尺寸等来蒙混顾客。同时，摊商的资金有限，差不多天天要到小手工业产品的市场和国营公司去进货，影响营业时间。而且同一行业的户数多，各户都要进一些一般消费者都需要的货物，因此经营的商品彼此相差不多，花色品种极不齐全。再加上零星进货费用大，卖价就要高，盲目竞争追求利润的结果，就增加了消费者的负担。东西贵、花色品种不全，顾客自然不愿意买。特别是从去年开始，国家为了更好地合理分配工农业产品供应消费者需要，国营商业代替了私营批发商的业务，掌握了主要商品的货源，摊商原来在自由市场赊购的商品受到限制，商品的品种就越来越少。这样使摊商的营业额逐渐下降，赔钱户月月增加。拿棉布摊商来说，从去年九月国家对棉布实行计划供应以后，市场的棉布摊商就全部成为国营公司的经销商。但是户数多，平均每户资金还不到六百元。除了购进一批青、蓝、白、灰布外，就没有力量购进质量高、花样新頴的布匹。大部分摊商只有二、三十种商品，顾客挑不上合适的布，买卖就一天天少了。虽然市花纱布公司供应站和东四区人民委员会商业科月月帮助他们算账、想办法维持他们的营业，用多分给畅销货、不要布票的布头等办法来照顾。但是摊商本身的弱点未能克服，因而今年第一季度里，十八户摊商中还是有十五户赔钱。
    在摊商经营困难的情况下，东四区人民委员会商业科和市花纱布公司供应站的工作人员经常向摊商宣传组织起来的好处。当时就有东四区人民代表、东四人民市场摊商联合委员会委员李子扬、棉布摊商组组长金永年向政府提出组织联购联销的要求。区人民委员会就决定先以棉布摊商为试点，组织联购联销组。但是，因为各户资金有大小、业务有好坏、家庭人口有多少，收入开支又各不相同，对联营的态度就不同。整个组织联购联销的过程，是个集体主义思想和分散落后思想斗争的过程。在十八户摊商中，除了积极带头的两户外，其中有十一户资金小、顾客少、经营能力差、地段又不好，营业不能维持，他们感到组织起来后有困难大家想办法解决，都积极拥护组织联购联销。有四户是资金较多、地段好、卖钱多、开支小、一般能维持经营的，顾虑就很多。摊商孙瀛洲说：“我的摊子地段好，买卖能维持，加入后垮了怎么办？如果不参加，大家都组织起来了，岂不会把我挤掉。”他左右为难，犹豫不决。也有个别户坚决不愿参加。如摊商李端然有一千五百元资金，家里有一所房子，子女都有工作，不做买卖生活也过得好，因而就坚决不愿意参加，并且还到处宣传：“十几户联在一起做买卖，怎么也搞不好……”
    针对这些情况，东四区人民委员会商业科和市花纱布公司东四区供应站的工作人员，在中共东四区委员会的领导下，从组织和领导摊商讨论和解决工资、资金入股股息和对困难户的照顾和补助等问题入手，来消除各种思想顾虑。他们暂时规定在联营后开始的三个月里，按照每人每月工资三十五元计算，三个月后再根据工作能力来进行民主评定。对资金入股计付股息的问题是资金较多户所关心的。孙瀛洲说：“我的资金多，坐吃也够吃三年的，加入了吃亏怎么办？”经大家研究，暂时采用按股金付息的办法，每月支付一定的股息，这样使资金多的解除了顾虑。有的摊商家庭人口多、只靠工资或股息收入还不能维持最低生活水平，大家决定要给以一定的补助。为了作好补助工作，摊商组织了调查小组，调查研究各户的生活和收支情况，经过自报开支民主评议，确定对困难户的补助，并决定根据三个月后各户评定工资后的收入情况，再适当变更或减免补助。另外，还规定在纯收益里提出一部分作为公益金，用做对病老、死亡等意外事故的补助金。区商业科还帮助他们讨论和制定了组织章程，规定具体的制度和办法。除了坚决不愿参加联购联销的李端然外，其余十七户棉布摊商都在今年四月一日起开始联营。
    棉布联购联销组的建立，给全市场的摊商指出了方向。从今年七月份开始，百货、文具、电料、鞋面、旧书、陶瓷等十四个行业吸取了棉布业联购联销组的经验，先后成立了联购联销筹备小组，酝酿联营。在区商业科的领导下，着重进行了集体教育，并且通过棉布联购联销组的具体事例，说明组织起来的好处。有个别摊商一面宣扬联营后不自由，
  一面买皮袄、收音机、制新衣。有少数摊商表面上赞成联营，背里造假账、想办法抽资金。筹备联营小组及时地向他们进行了批评和教育。对少数不愿参加联购联销的，同意他们单独经营；对个别反抗或破坏联营的，决定在一定时期内不吸收他们入组。到九月初，就建立了十五个联购联销小组。
    组织联营后短短的几个月来，已经显示出很大的优越性，许多过去不愿参加联营或暂时不被吸收入组的摊商，看到组织起来的好处，纷纷申请参加。
    联购联销后资金可以集中起来用，能增加进货的品种，克服过去分散经营进货品种少的缺点。如棉布业联营后就增添了一百四十多种商品，过去没有力量进货的灯心绒、双面卡叽、泡泡纱等商品，现在也能增添了。联营前摊商资金少，周转困难，天天要跑公司、市场进货，浪费很多运费。联营后有了业务会计组，有专人成批统一进货。第一个月的运费就降低了百分之八十三点九二。过去摊商的经营费用和家庭开支混在一起，赚多就多花、赚少就少花，赔钱就吃老本。联营后收入固定了，克服了浪费。针织、一般百货、搪瓷三个组，九月份比八月份降低开支百分之三十九点二二。许多组在联营的第一个月都有了盈余。如棉布业三月份赔了六十元，四月份全组就赚纯利五百八十元，初步改变了苦乐不匀的情况。资金多了，从国营公司进货的比重就逐步增加；逐步提高，同时又保持他们原来经营的品种花色，以适应消费者不同的需要。这样一方面使业务纳入国家计划的轨道，便于国营公司对他们进行改造；另一方面又保持了它们原来的经营特点。组织联营后，摊商初步改变了经营作风，一般商品都按国营公司牌价出售。国营公司没有牌价的商品，也能适当地降低价格，使价格合理，顾客满意。很多机关团体、市民都愿意到市场来买东西。如北京市立第五医院职工一次就买了二十七匹棉布。
    联购联销组还建立了各种制度，主要是健全了会计制度，专设会计建立账目。十五个联购联销组都在市人民银行立了账户。这些组还建立了上下班、请假和学习等制度，便于组织学习，从思想上进一步得到改造。
    东四人民市场的十五个联购联销组，已经给全市场的摊商树立了榜样。现在有自行车零件、新鞋、皮箱、毛衣、服装等五个行业一百六十四户摊商正申请联营。百货类系统的联购联销组正在申请合并成一个大的联购联销组。
    事实说明，在摊商集中的市场中组织摊商联购联销是切实可行的。这一组织形式适合于目前摊商的经济基础和觉悟程度，对进一步对摊商进行社会主义改造创造了良好的条件。
