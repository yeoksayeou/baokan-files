    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Should Prevent Roller Breakage Accidents
    To the Editor:
    This year, roller breakage accidents in the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's thin plate workshop have been extremely serious. According to statistics from January to November, this workshop breaks an average of one roller every six days. This loss alone amounted to 120,000 yuan more in the eleven months of this year than in the entire year of last year.
    The main reason for the roller breakage accidents is that the factory has neglected safety production education, resulting in serious violations of operating procedures. The output of many production teams in this workshop is characterized by being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end. The average hourly output in the last two hours is often 40 percent higher than the average hourly output in the first six hours. Violations of operating procedures often occur at this time, and roller breakage accidents follow. The Iron and Steel Industry Bureau has repeatedly pointed out this weak link, but they have not paid attention to improving it.
    I believe that as long as the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant strengthens its specific leadership over production, educates workers to conscientiously implement technical operating procedures, and humbly learns from advanced Soviet experience, the roller breakage accidents in the thin plate workshop can be completely eliminated.

### 太原钢铁厂应该防止轧辊折断事故

    太原钢铁厂应该防止轧辊折断事故编辑同志：
    今年，太原钢铁厂薄板车间轧辊折断事故十分严重。据一月到十一月的统计，这个车间平均每六天就要折断一根轧辊。光这一项损失，今年十一个月就比去年全年多十二万元。
    发生轧辊折断事故的原因，主要是这个工厂忽视了安全生产的教育，以致违反操作规程的现象很严重。这个车间许多生产班的产量都是前松后紧，最后两小时的平均小时产量往往比前六小时的平均小时产量多百分之四十。违反操作规程的现象常常在这个时候发生，轧辊折断事故也就跟着出现了。钢铁工业管理局曾一再指出了这个薄弱环节，但是他们并不注意改进。
    我认为，只要太原钢铁厂加强对生产的具体领导，教育职工认真执行技术操作规程，虚心地学习苏联先进经验，薄板车间断辊事故是完全可以消灭的。　　　学天
