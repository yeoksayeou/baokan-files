    For the past two months, the agricultural cooperation movement in the Pingdiquan Administrative District of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has greatly developed. The number of peasant households joining cooperatives has increased from 13.3 percent of the total number of peasant households to 38.9 percent. However, the development of the movement is uneven. Jining County in this administrative district has grown from 16 percent to 67 percent, while Wudong County, which has similar conditions to Jining County, has only grown to 19.9 percent.
    Why are there two different speeds? One of the main reasons is the different leadership methods adopted by the two counties. Jining County adopted the method of relying on the township branches to run cooperatives. Branches with experience in establishing cooperatives directly led the establishment and expansion of cooperatives. Branches without experience were trained for a short period and then studied in pilot cooperative work for a period before leading the establishment and expansion of cooperatives. What about Wudong County? Although the county and district leaders also said they relied on the branches to run cooperatives, in reality, they did not dare to let the branches do it. Instead, they relied on the work teams sent down to directly run cooperatives. The branches only provided information to the work teams and accepted the tasks assigned by the work teams. Jining County's leadership method is correct, so the cooperative movement developed quickly. Wudong County's leadership method is incorrect, so the development of the movement is naturally slow. Counties like Wudong should quickly change this timid leadership method, otherwise, it will hinder the development of the cooperative movement in these areas.

    两种方法，两种速度
    两个月来，内蒙古自治区平地泉行政区的农业合作化运动有了很大发展。全区入社农户由原来占总农户的百分之十三点三发展到百分之三十八点九。可是，运动的发展是不平衡的。这个行政区的集宁县由百分之十六发展到了百分之六十七，而条件和集宁县差不多的武东县却只发展到百分之十九点九。
    为什么会出现两种不同的速度呢？主要原因之一是这两个县的领导方法不一样。集宁县采用了依靠乡支部办社的方法，凡是有建社经验的支部，就直接领导建社、扩社；没有经验的支部，经过短期训练，又在办社的试点工作中学习一段以后，就去领导建社、扩社。而武东县呢？虽然县区领导人员口头上也说依靠支部办社，可是，实际上，就是不敢让支部去干，还是依靠派下去的工作组直接办社，支部只是向工作组供给情况，接受工作组分配的任务。集宁县的领导方法是正确的，因此，合作化运动发展很快。武东县的领导方法是不正确的，运动的发展自然就慢了。像武东这样一类的县，应该赶快改变这种小手小脚的领导方法，否则，就会阻碍这类地区的合作化运动的发展。
