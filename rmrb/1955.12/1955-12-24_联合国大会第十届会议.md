    The Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly

    The three-month-long Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly was a meeting with some valuable records. From this, people began to have a refreshing feeling about the United Nations.

    One of the most prominent features of this session was the strong desire of many countries for the United Nations to return to the path stipulated by the United Nations Charter. The achievements of the Bandung Conference in April and the Four-Power Summit Conference in July in easing international tensions created a favorable atmosphere for international cooperation at this session. Thanks to the efforts of many countries, the "Bandung Spirit" and the "Geneva Spirit" were developed to a certain extent at this session. Although some people still wanted to treat the United Nations General Assembly as a tool for them to create the "Cold War," as in previous years, their "good" days were clearly beginning to bid them farewell. They tried their best, but they were not able to completely prevent this session from making some achievements in promoting international cooperation.

    The common will of the vast majority of countries in the United Nations to strengthen international cooperation is most clearly manifested in the struggle to achieve the principle that United Nations membership should be universal. Although the United States still refuses to change its stubborn stance of excluding peaceful and democratic countries from joining the United Nations, and continues to obstruct the deadlock in opening the United Nations to new members, thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union and most other countries, the US's destructive conspiracy was finally defeated, and this session opened the door of the United Nations to sixteen countries. The admission of sixteen new member states to the General Assembly is a major achievement in the cause of international cooperation and provides a more favorable basis for the United Nations to further promote international cooperation. This situation is clearly unfavorable to those forces that attempt to monopolize the United Nations as a tool for the policies of a few countries and undermine the cause of the United Nations. This is why world opinion warmly welcomes the achievements made by this session of the General Assembly on the issue of admitting new member states.

    The resolution passed by this session on the establishment of an international atomic energy agency also reflects the desire of most countries to conduct truly equal international cooperation. In the process of discussing this issue, the attempt by the United States and a few other countries to monopolize the proposed international organization was unsuccessful. The resolution of the Political Committee of the General Assembly stipulates that twelve countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, India, and Czechoslovakia, should jointly draft the charter of the international atomic energy agency, and stipulates that a second international conference on the peaceful use of atomic energy should be held within two or three years. The resolution of the General Assembly has taken a step forward in the cause of international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    More and more countries in the United Nations are demanding that the United Nations play its role in safeguarding human rights and the right to national self-determination in accordance with the Charter. In this session, the anti-colonial struggle was unprecedentedly high. The Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, as well as Asian and African countries, demonstrated their great strength in anti-colonialism here. Some Latin American countries and some European countries, such as Greece, also naturally disregarded the pressure from the United States and showed their due anti-colonial stance on individual issues. This put colonial countries such as the United States, Britain, and France in a very isolated position. Representatives of many countries at the meeting strongly condemned the bloody acts of Western colonial countries in suppressing national liberation movements with violence, and demanded the eradication of the scourge of colonialism. Some sharp colonial issues, such as the Algerian issue, the Moroccan issue, and the West Irian issue, were included in the agenda of this session despite the obstruction of the colonial countries. The fact that the General Assembly later agreed not to review these issues for the time being does not mean that the anti-colonial countries have relaxed their struggle. When representatives of Asian and Arab countries expressed their agreement that this session should not further consider the Algerian issue, they clearly stated that they still believed that the United Nations had every right to discuss this issue, and they would not abandon their original position.

    It is particularly worth noting that the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee of the General Assembly, despite repeated obstruction and threats from the United States, Britain and other countries, adopted by an overwhelming majority a resolution stipulating that a clause recognizing the right to national self-determination should be included in the draft international covenant on human rights. This should be regarded as a major victory achieved by the anti-colonial countries at this session.

    From the discussions and votes on the above issues, it can be seen that the United States is no longer as easy to control the entire United Nations in its hands as it used to be. This is particularly evident in the struggle to elect non-permanent members of the Security Council. Although the United States tried its best to undermine the principle of regional allocation agreed upon, and insisted on having the Philippines occupy the seat that should belong to Eastern European countries, it failed to achieve its goal even after more than thirty votes. Yugoslavia was finally elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. This fact vividly illustrates that justice is in the hearts of the people, and the principles of international agreements cannot be undermined.

    The Tenth General Assembly left the United States with a series of records of isolation and failure. People cannot but agree with the analysis of "Christian Science Monitor" reporter Fry, who said: The situation at this session proves that the prestige and influence of the United States are obviously gradually disappearing, "Many diplomats believe that this is one of the most important developments in the ten-year history of the United Nations."

    It is precisely because the United States cannot do whatever it wants that this session of the General Assembly has been able to achieve some achievements on certain issues that are conducive to international peace and cooperation. However, at the same time, it must be pointed out that the Tenth General Assembly is still far from reaching the due representativeness and role that it should have as a world organization for maintaining peace and promoting international cooperation in many aspects.

    First of all, due to the continued obstruction of the United States and some other countries that follow it, the People's Republic of China, which has nearly a quarter of the world's population, is still deprived of its legitimate status in the United Nations, which makes the United Nations organization still unable to play its due role well. After the United Nations General Assembly admitted sixteen new member states, the unreasonableness and harm of excluding the true representatives of 600 million people became even more prominent. This situation is in fact inconsistent with the wishes of the vast majority of countries in the United Nations. In the process of discussing the issue of admitting new member states at this session, it was once again convincingly shown that the United States' forcing the Chiang Kai-shek clique into the United Nations, allowing it to usurp the seat of the People's Republic of China, can only damage the prestige and role of the United Nations. Therefore, more and more countries are demanding that the Chiang Kai-shek clique be expelled from the United Nations and advocating that the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations be restored as soon as possible.

    The people of all countries originally eagerly hoped that this session of the General Assembly would make beneficial contributions to easing international tensions and promoting universal disarmament. However, the United States, Britain, France and other countries tried their best to obstruct the full discussion of the Soviet Union's proposal on "measures to further ease international tensions and develop international cooperation," and at the same time forced the General Assembly to adopt their proposals, which actually prevented the realization of universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. They used this to evade the main task of reaching an agreement to end the arms race and eliminate the threat of atomic war. As a result, this session of the United Nations General Assembly did not achieve any positive results on the issue of disarmament.

    The United States also continues to obstruct the United Nations from promoting a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the same way. It unreasonably asked the General Assembly to discuss the Korean issue without the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, which made the United Nations make no progress on this issue.

    Although there are such serious shortcomings, this session of the United Nations General Assembly reflects in a certain sense the important developments in the current international situation. At present, the policies of maintaining peace and national independence pursued by the Soviet Union, China, India and other peace-loving countries are receiving more and more support in the world, the number of countries in the world pursuing independent and neutral policies is increasing, the contradictions within the Western countries' bloc are becoming more and more acute, and easing the situation and peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems are the general trend and the will of the people. If the United States wants to obstruct and continue to instigate the "Cold War," it cannot but fall into isolation and suffer greater failures. The process and results of the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly vividly illustrate this fundamental trend in the development of the current international situation.

    This session of the United Nations General Assembly also shows that as long as the vast majority of countries have a sincere desire for international cooperation, the United Nations organization can better play its role. People have reason to hope that all peace-loving countries in the United Nations will redouble their efforts to restore the United Nations to a truly representative and universal international organization that maintains peace and promotes international cooperation.

### 联合国大会第十届会议

    联合国大会第十届会议
    历时三个月的联合国大会第十届会议是一个有一些可贵的纪录的会议。从这里，人们开始对联合国有了些耳目一新的感觉。
    这一届大会的一个最显著的特色，就是许多国家要求联合国回到联合国宪章所规定的道路上去的强烈愿望。今年四月的万隆会议以及七月的四国政府首脑会议在缓和国际紧张局势方面所取得的成就，为本届大会创造了一种有利的国际合作的气氛。由于许多国家作出了努力，“万隆精神”和“日内瓦精神”在本届大会上得到了一定的发展。尽管有人还是想照年年的旧例，把联合国大会当成他们制造“冷战”的工具，但是他们过去的“好”日子却显然开始在向他们告别。他们费尽了心力，却没有能够完全阻止得住本届大会在促进国际合作方面有所作为。
    联合国中绝大多数国家要求加强国际合作的共同意志，最明显地表现在争取实现联合国会员国应该具有普遍性的原则的斗争中。虽然美国依然不肯改变它排斥和平民主国家参加联合国的顽固立场，继续阻挠打开联合国接纳新会员国问题的僵局，但是由于苏联和其他大多数国家的努力，终于击败了美国的破坏阴谋，使本届大会为十六个国家打开了联合国的大门。大会接纳了十六个新的会员国，这是国际合作事业的一个重大成就，并且为联合国进一步促进国际合作提供了更有利的基础。这种局面显然是不利于那些企图垄断联合国作为少数国家的政策的工具和破坏联合国事业的势力的。这就是为什么世界舆论热烈欢迎本届大会在接纳新会员国问题上所取得的成就的原因。
    这届会议通过的建立原子能国际机构的决议，也反映了大多数国家要求进行真正平等的国际合作的愿望。在讨论这个问题的过程中，美国等少数国家企图垄断拟议中的国际机构并未成功，联大政委会的决议规定由苏、美、英、法、印度、捷克斯洛伐克等十二国共同来拟订原子能国际机构的章程，并且规定在两、三年内举行第二次和平利用原子能国际会议。大会的决议把在和平利用原子能方面进行国际合作的事业向前推进了一步。
    联合国中愈来愈多的国家要求联合国根据宪章发挥其维护人权和民族自决权利的作用。在本届大会中，反殖民主义的斗争空前高涨。苏联和人民民主国家以及亚非国家在这里显示了反殖民主义的巨大力量。一部分拉丁美洲国家和欧洲有的国家如希腊也很自然地不顾美国的压力，在个别问题上表现了它们应有的反对殖民主义的立场。这就使美、英、法等殖民国家处于十分孤立的地位。许多国家的代表在会议上猛烈谴责了西方殖民国家用暴力镇压民族解放运动的血腥行径，要求根除殖民主义的祸害。一些尖锐的殖民地问题，如阿尔及利亚问题、摩洛哥问题、西伊里安问题等，都不顾殖民国家的阻挠列入了这届会议的议程。大会后来同意暂不审议这些问题，并不意味着反殖民主义各国放松它们的斗争。亚洲和阿拉伯国家的代表在表示同意本届会议不进一步考虑阿尔及利亚问题的时候就明白声明：他们仍然认为联合国完全有权讨论这一问题，他们不会放弃原有的立场。
    特别值得注意的是，大会社会、人道及文化委员会，不顾美、英等国的一再阻挠和威胁，以绝大多数通过决议，规定在国际人权公约草案中列入承认民族自决权的条款。这应该被看作是反殖民主义国家在本届大会中所取得的一个重大的胜利。
    从上述各项问题的讨论和表决当中，都可以看到，美国已经不像过去那样容易把整个联合国控制在它的手中了。这特别明显地表现在选举安全理事会非常任理事国的斗争中。美国虽然费尽了力气想破坏协议的地区分配原则，硬要使菲律宾占据应该属于东欧国家的席位，但是经过了三十多次投票也没有能够达到目的，南斯拉夫终于被选为安全理事会的非常任理事国。这个事实生动地说明了公道自在人心，国际协定的原则是不容破坏的。
    十届联大给美国留下的是一连串孤立和失败的记录。人们不能不同意美国“基督教科学箴言报”记者弗莱的分析，他说：这届会议的情况证明，美国的威望和影响显然在逐渐消失，“许多外交家认为这是联合国的十年的历史中最重大的发展之一”。
    正是由于美国不能为所欲为，所以本届大会能够在某些问题上取得了有助于国际和平和合作的一些成就。但是同时必须指出，十届联大在许多方面还远没有达到它作为一个维护和平和促进国际合作的世界组织的应有的代表性和作用。
    首先，由于美国以及一些追随它的其他国家继续阻挠，拥有将近全世界四分之一人口的中华人民共和国仍被剥夺在联合国中的合法地位，这就使得联合国组织仍然不能很好地发挥它应有的作用。在联合国大会接纳了十六个新会员国之后，把六亿人的真正代表排挤在外的不合理和有害显得更为突出。这种情况事实上是不符合联合国中绝大多数国家的愿望的。本届会议在讨论接纳新会员国问题的过程中，再一次令人信服地表明，美国把蒋介石集团强塞在联合国中，让它窃踞着中华人民共和国的席位，只能使联合国的威信和作用受到损害。因此愈来愈多的国家都要求把蒋介石集团驱逐出联合国，主张尽速恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。
    各国人民原来殷切期望本届大会在缓和国际紧张局势和促进普遍裁减军备方面作出有益的贡献。但是美、英、法等国家竭力阻挠对苏联提出的“关于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的措施”的提案进行充分的讨论，同时迫使大会通过了它们所提出的、实际上是阻止实现普遍裁军和禁止原子武器的议案。它们借此来规避达成协议以结束军备竞赛和消除原子战争威胁的主要任务。因而就使本届联合国大会在裁军问题上没有获得任何积极的结果。
    美国同样的也继续阻挠联合国促成朝鲜问题的和平解决。它无理地要大会在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国代表参加下讨论朝鲜问题，这就使得联合国在这个问题上毫无进展。
    虽然有着这样一些严重的缺点，本届联合国大会在一定的意义上反映了当前国际局势中的重要发展。目前，苏联、中国、印度及其他爱好和平国家奉行的维护和平和民族独立政策正在世界上受到越来越多的支持，世界上奉行独立和中立政策的国家正越来越多，西方国家集团内部的矛盾正越来越尖锐，和缓局势以及不同制度国家间的和平共处，乃是大势所趋，人心所向。美国要阻挠，要继续煽动
  “冷战”，就不能不陷于孤立和遭到更大失败。联合国大会第十届会议的进程和结果，正是鲜明地说明了目前国际局势发展中的这种根本趋向。
    本届联合国大会同时也表明了：只要绝大多数国家具有国际合作的真诚愿望，联合国组织是能够更好地发挥它的作用的。人们有理由希望，联合国中一切爱好和平国家将要加倍努力，使联合国恢复成为一个真正具有充分的代表性和普遍性的维护和平和促进国际合作的国际机构。
