This newspaper's Shandong dispatch from Jinan, December 4th: The first passenger and cargo ship on the Luokou to Sunkou section of the Yellow River in Shandong, the Yellow River "Lu No. 1," was launched for a trial voyage at Luokou Wharf on December 3rd. This newly painted ship sailed smoothly at a speed of 10 kilometers upstream and 35 kilometers downstream, fully meeting the pre-set requirements.

This ship was designed by the Shandong Provincial River Transport Administration itself and built using locally sourced materials. The design carefully incorporated the shipbuilding experience of the Soviet Union and a thorough study of the Yellow River's characteristics, making the equipment very safe. If the bow cabin encounters a shoal, the hull and stern will automatically turn towards deeper water. If the bow cabin is damaged, water will not enter the cargo hold; if the bottom hold is damaged, water will not enter the passenger cabin. If one of the two engines fails, it can still navigate safely as usual.

The Yellow River "Lu No. 1" ship is 29 meters long and 5.5 meters wide. The cargo hold can carry 45 tons of cargo, and the two-story passenger cabin has 175 spacious and comfortable soft and hard seat berths. The passenger cabin has sufficient safety and life-saving equipment, as well as a small shop dedicated to serving passengers with tea, snacks, and candies. Traveling on such a comfortable and safe ship is something that passengers on the Yellow River have never enjoyed before.

The Shandong Provincial River Transport Administration has decided to start passenger and cargo transportation on the Luokou to Sunkou section (167 kilometers long) from December 10th. This section of the journey will only take 16 to 17 hours upstream against the current, while wooden sailboats normally require five to six days. The adoption of steamship transportation on the Yellow River route will play a significant role in strengthening urban-rural exchanges in more than ten counties including Dong'a, Shou'zhang, Yuncheng, and Juancheng, and in supporting socialist construction.

### 黄河泺口至孙口段第一艘客货轮试航成功

    黄河泺口至孙口段第一艘客货轮试航成功
    本报济南四日电　黄河山东泺口至孙口段的第一艘客货轮——黄河“鲁一号”，十二月三日在泺口码头下水试航。这艘油漆崭新的轮船，以逆水十公里和顺水三十五公里的时速平稳地驶行，完全达到了预先要求的水平。
    这艘轮船是山东省河运管理局自己设计、就地取材建成的。在设计中由于认真学习了苏联的造船经验和仔细地研究了黄河的水性，设备非常安全。如果前头尖舱碰到浅滩，船身和船尾就会自动向深水处转动。万一尖舱碰坏，货舱里也灌不进水；底舱坏了，客舱也不会进水。假若两台机器有一台发生故障，仍可照常安全航行。
    黄河“鲁一号”轮船全长二十九公尺，宽五公尺半，货舱能载货四十五吨，两层客舱有一百七十五个宽敞、舒适的软硬席座位。客舱里有足够的安全救生设备，还有专为旅客服务的出售茶水、点心和糖果等的小卖部。坐这样舒适、安全的轮船航行，是黄河上的旅客们过去从没有享受过的。
    山东省河运管理局已决定从十二月十日开始泺口至孙口段（全长一百六十七公里）的客货运输，这一段航程逆水上行只要十六、七个小时即可到达，而木帆船在正常情况下也需要五、六天的时间。黄河航线上采用汽轮运输，对加强东阿、寿张、郓城、鄄城等十多个县的城乡交流、支援社会主义建设将会起很大的作用。
