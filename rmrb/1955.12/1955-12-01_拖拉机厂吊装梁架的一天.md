    A Day of Lifting Beams and Frames at the Tractor Factory
    By Our Correspondent Gao Liang
    November 26th was an exciting day. On this day, the first tractor manufacturing plant in our country began to hoist beams, columns, steel frames, and roof panels. On the wilderness that was overgrown with weeds three months ago, a spacious and bright workshop will emerge. In a few years, teams of tractors will roll out from here. What an exciting and encouraging thing this is!
    Early in the morning, the workers gathered at the site. They had started preparations two days ago when they heard the news of the installation. The leaders of the Mechanization Engineering Company and various work areas repeatedly briefed the workers on the technology and repeatedly explained the importance of safe production and ensuring quality. Earthwork workers raced to level the installation site. The technicians responsible for surveying and inspection had already measured the columns, beams, and foundations, and marked the center lines on the columns and column bases in advance for correction during installation. All materials used in the installation were placed on site in order. The huge crane stretched its arms and stood quietly on the construction site. At this time, people quickly checked their tools and machines according to their assigned procedures and sections.
    At eight o'clock, the siren on the construction site sounded loudly. The crane's motor started. A convoy of heavy-duty trucks brought prefabricated cement roof panels to the site. Comprehensive hoisting began. Crane driver Pei Zhuofu rotated the crane and hoisted the first factory column. Young assistant driver Wu Xiuyang hoisted the second factory column. Then, rigger Zhou Fusheng skillfully climbed up the upright column along a long rope. Like the first brave warrior to climb the city in a siege battle, he climbed up and quickly removed the sling from the column. Now it was the turn of Youth League member Wang Qinyou, whose task was to stand on the top of the six-meter-high column and correct the column head.
    In less than two hours, four factory columns were hoisted and installed. The crane then hoisted steel frames weighing several tons. This comprehensive installation method is an advanced construction method used in the Soviet Union for the installation of factory buildings. Large cranes do not need to move back and forth, and all prefabricated structures such as columns, beams, and roof trusses are installed at once, which can improve the efficiency of machinery use, reduce manpower, and avoid material waste. This will allow the factory to be completed ahead of schedule.

    拖拉机厂吊装梁架的一天
    本报记者　高粮
    十一月二十六日是令人兴奋的一天。这天，我国第一座拖拉机制造厂开始吊装梁、柱、钢架和屋面板。在三个月前还长满荒草的原野上，将要出现一座宽大豁亮的车间，几年以后将由这里开出成队的拖拉机，这是一件多么令人欢欣鼓舞的事呵！
    清晨，工人们就聚集到了现场。还在两天前他们听到安装的消息，就开始了准备工作。机械化工程公司同各工区的领导人员连续向工人进行了多次技术交底，并反复说明了安全生产同保证质量的重要性。土方工人们争先平整了安装的场地。担负测量和检查任务的技术人员早就测好了柱子、房梁和基础，把柱子和柱基提前弹上了中线，以便安装时校正。安装中应用的一切材料都按顺序摆在现场。巨大的吊车伸着臂膀静静地停在工地上。这时人们迅速地根据自己分工的工序、地段检查了工具和机器。
    八点钟，工地上的汽笛长鸣。吊车的马达发动了。大队载重汽车拉着预制水泥屋板来到了场地。综合吊装开始了。吊车司机裴卓夫旋动吊车，吊起了第一根厂柱。年青的助理司机吴秀洋吊起了第二根厂柱。接着，起重工周福生顺着一条长绳熟练地攀上了立柱，他像攻城战中第一名登城的勇士一样，爬上去迅速地解掉了柱上的吊索。现在轮到青年团员汪琴友了，他的任务是站在六公尺高的柱顶上校正柱头。
    不到两个小时，就有四个厂柱吊装完毕，吊车继而吊起了数吨重的钢架。这种综合安装法是苏联在建筑厂房安装工程中的先进施工方法，大型起重机不必来回移动，一次就把柱、梁、屋架等全部预制结构装好，可以提高机械的使用效率，减少人力，避免材料浪费。这样就可以提前把工厂建成。
