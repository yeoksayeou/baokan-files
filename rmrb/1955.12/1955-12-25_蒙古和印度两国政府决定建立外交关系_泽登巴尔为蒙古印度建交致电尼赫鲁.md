    To His Excellency Prime Minister Nehru, Delhi:
    Respected Prime Minister,

    Please accept my warm congratulations and respect for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Mongolian People's Republic and the Republic of India.

    This event of great significance will undoubtedly promote the friendly relations between our two countries, promote the development and consolidation of the friendship between our two peoples, and help consolidate the cause of peace.

    The Mongolian people have deep respect for the talented and great Indian people who have thousands of years of culture and are fighting to consolidate their national independence.

    Our people and our government pay warm tribute to the independent Republic of India, which has made significant contributions to the struggle to ease international tensions and strengthen world peace. They highly value the fact that, in addition to the Soviet Union actively defending the right of the Mongolian People's Republic to join the United Nations, India has also made lofty efforts to support the proposal to admit our country as a member of the United Nations.

    The Mongolian government fully supports the Five Principles (Panchsheel) jointly announced by India and the People's Republic of China, and subsequently announced at the Bandung Conference, and believes that these principles should be the basis for international peaceful cooperation.

    Please accept, Mr. Prime Minister, my heartfelt greetings and best wishes to yourself and to the great Indian people.

        Yu. Tsedenbal
        Premier of the Mongolian People's Republic
                  December 24, 1955
