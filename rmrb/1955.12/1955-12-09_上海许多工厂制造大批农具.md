More than 100 local state-owned, joint state-private, and private mechanical and electrical factories in Shanghai have manufactured 270,000 farm tool accessories and 129 agricultural machines for farmers this year. Among these machines are threshers that can separate wheat, barley, sorghum, etc., from the stalks and sort the stalks and chaff separately; sprayers for spraying pesticides; and green fodder cutters used by livestock farms for cutting green fodder. These machines have been shipped to Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Guangdong, Northeast China, and other places, and have been welcomed by the local people.

In order to support the high tide of the rural cooperative movement, Shanghai factories are currently designing a batch of new farm tools for rural areas, including power sprayers and diesel water pumps. The Shanghai First Bureau of Heavy Industry is also preparing to trial-produce a complete set of 240-kilowatt steam power generation equipment in the first half of next year for power generation and lighting in rural areas and small cities.

    上海许多工厂制造大批农具
    上海市一百多家地方国营、公私合营和私营机电工厂，今年已经为农民制造了二十七万件农具配件和一百二十九台农业机器。在这些机器中，有能够把小麦、大麦、高粱等从茎秆上脱下来，并且把茎秆、籽糠等分别整理好的脱粒机；有喷射农药用的喷雾机；也有畜牧场用来切割青饲料的青饲切割机等，这些机器，运往内蒙古、四川、广东、东北等地，得到了当地人民的欢迎。
    为了支援农村合作化运动高潮的到来，目前上海市各工厂正在为各地农村设计一批新式农具，其中有动力喷雾机、柴油抽水机等。上海第一重工业局还准备在明年上半年试制一种二百四十瓩的成套蒸气发电设备，以供农村和小城市发电和照明用。
