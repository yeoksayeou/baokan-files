Xinhua News Agency, New York. The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on November 29th. The General Assembly passed the United States' proposal on the Korean issue with a majority of forty-four votes. Eleven countries, including the Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, Burma, Indonesia, Syria, Chile, and Bolivia, abstained from voting, as they had done previously in the Political Committee.

    Soviet representative Malik, in explaining his reasons for voting, said that the discussion on the Korean issue at this session of the General Assembly, like the discussions at previous sessions, has not and cannot produce positive results. This is because the General Assembly is discussing this issue without the participation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, and without taking into account the actual situation in Korea and the Far East.

    Malik said that in the Political Committee, the actions of the United States delegation and the delegations of certain other participating countries in Korea were actually aimed at obstructing a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, obstructing the convening of a conference of relevant countries to discuss the Korean issue, obstructing the establishment of relations and cooperation between North and South Korea, and supporting the South Korean authorities who openly oppose the armistice agreement and are preparing to resume hostile activities.

    Malik then pointed out that strengthening peace in Korea is a necessary prerequisite for resolving the Korean issue. The Soviet delegation supports the provisions in the U.S. proposal that confirm the need to strictly abide by the armistice agreement and call for further efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The Soviet Union believes that the solution to the Korean issue is primarily a matter for the Korean people themselves.

    Malik further pointed out that the U.S. proposal does not mention convening a conference of relevant countries to discuss the Korean issue, nor does it propose any concrete measures to resolve this issue. This proposal does not stem from a desire to establish and develop mutually beneficial relations and cooperation between North and South Korea. The Soviet delegation believes that urgent and practical measures must be taken to resolve the Korean issue, and that a conference of relevant countries must be convened for this purpose.

    Indian representative Menon said that the current proposal does not help resolve the Korean issue.

    联大多数通过朝鲜问题的提案
    新华社据塔斯社纽约讯　联合国大会十一月二十九日举行全体会议。大会以四十四票多数通过了美国关于朝鲜问题的提案。苏联、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、叙利亚、智利、玻利维亚等十一个国家像过去在政治委员会一样在表决的时候弃权。
    苏联代表马立克在解释他的投票理由时说，在本届大会上关于朝鲜问题的讨论，像在以前的各届大会上的讨论一样，没有、而且也不可能产生积极的结果。因为大会是在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国参加，也没有考虑到朝鲜和远东的实际局势的情况下讨论这个问题的。
    马立克说，在政治委员会中，美国代表团以及在朝鲜的某些其他参战国代表团的行动，目的实际上一直是阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题，阻挠召开一次讨论朝鲜问题的有关国家的会议，阻挠南北朝鲜之间建立关系和合作，而支持公开反对停战协定和准备恢复敌对活动的南朝鲜当局。
    马立克接着指出，加强朝鲜的和平是解决朝鲜问题的一个必要的先行条件。苏联代表团支持美国提案中关于确认必须严格遵守停战协定的条款，并且要求为和平解决朝鲜问题作进一步的努力。苏联认为，朝鲜问题的解决首先是朝鲜人民自己的事情。
    马立克接着指出，美国的提案中没有提到召集一次有关国家的会议来讨论朝鲜问题，而且没有提出任何具体措施来解决这个问题。这个提案不是从建立和发展北朝鲜和南朝鲜之间的互利关系和合作的愿望出发的。苏联代表团认为必须采取紧急的切实措施来解决朝鲜问题，而且必须为了这个目的而召开有关国家的会议。
    印度代表梅农说，目前的提案无助于解决朝鲜问题。
