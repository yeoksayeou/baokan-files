    Running the Cooperative Diligently and Thriftily Leads to a Bumper Harvest

    Editor:

    The Third Agricultural Production Cooperative of Victory Village, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, was organized last winter by twenty-one poor and lower-middle peasant households. Although this cooperative encountered many difficulties after its establishment, thanks to the close unity and diligent, thrifty management of its members, it finally overcame these difficulties and achieved a bumper harvest.

    This agricultural production cooperative has 102 hectares of land and needs fifteen horses for plowing, but the cooperative only had six horses, and fodder was also scarce. The cooperative director, Shao Shichang, actively relied on the masses, mobilizing sixteen member households to find ways to raise money to buy eight horses; the deputy director, Zhang Desheng, borrowed another horse from a relative. To solve the problem of fodder, the cooperative organized some members to collect firewood in the deep mountains after the Spring Festival, and also organized the remaining members to weave mats at home. The entire spring was spent busily engaged in sideline production, earning a total of more than 500 yuan, which, together with more than 600 yuan in loans from banks and credit cooperatives, not only solved the problem of fodder for spring plowing and the first weeding, but also replenished necessary small farm tools, and purchased fifteen bags of dried manure and some pesticides, ensuring timely sowing during spring plowing and thorough weeding and thinning during the first weeding. When the summer weeding entered the stage of the first and second weeding, the cooperative adopted the method of feeding the livestock at night and at midday to solve the problem of fodder.

    The agricultural production cooperative demonstrated its superiority in production. This year's grain harvest greatly exceeded that of mutual aid teams and individual farmers. It is estimated that the income of each member household will increase by 15 to 50 percent compared to before joining the cooperative. For example, Liang Shaochen, who lived a life of semi-starvation before joining the cooperative, earned more than 300 yuan this year. In the past, many people said that this cooperative was a "poor wretch cooperative" and "it would definitely not be run well"; but now such words are no longer heard, and eighteen more peasant households have applied to join the cooperative.

### 勤俭办社获得了丰收

    勤俭办社获得了丰收编辑同志：
    黑龙江省海伦县胜利村第三农业生产合作社，是在去年冬天由二十一户贫农和下中农组织起来的。这个社建立以后虽然遇到了很多困难，但是由于社员们紧密团结，勤俭办社，终于战胜了困难，获得了丰收。
    这个农业生产合作社一百零二垧土地，需要十五匹马来耕，但是社里只有六匹马，草料也很缺。社主任邵世昌就积极依靠群众，动员了十六户社员想办法凑钱买了八匹马；副主任张德生又到亲戚家借了一匹马。为了解决草料问题，社里在春节以后就组织一部分社员到深山打柴，还把其余的社员组织起来在家里编席子；整个春天紧张地搞副业生产，共收入五百多元，再加上银行和信用社贷给的六百多元，不但解决了春耕和夏锄头遍地的马草料，而且还添补了必需的小农具，买了十五袋大粪干和一些农药，保证了春耕适时播种和夏锄头遍地除草间苗。当夏锄进入头遍接二遍的时候，社里又采取了放夜马和放晌午马的办法喂养牲口，解决了草料的问题。
    农业生产合作社在生产中显示了它的优越性，今年收获的粮食大大超过互助组和单干农民，预计每一户社员的收入要比入社以前增加百分之十五到五十。如梁绍臣入社前过着半饥半饱的生活，今年就收入了三百多元。过去有很多人说这个社是“穷棒子社”，“一定办不好”；但是现在这种话已经听不见了，而且有十八户农民要求入社。
