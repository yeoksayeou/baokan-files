    It is Inappropriate to Reject the Families of Martyrs and Soldiers, Military Families, and Demobilized Soldiers from Joining Cooperatives
    Editor:
    Article 11, Section 2 of the "Draft Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" stipulates that agricultural production cooperatives should actively absorb demobilized soldiers and the families of martyrs and soldiers, etc., which is very correct and necessary. Judging from the current situation in our county, although most agricultural cooperatives have already done this, there have also been some instances of excluding or making things difficult for the families of martyrs and soldiers, military families, and demobilized soldiers to join the cooperatives. For example, Gao Fengdi, a military family member from Zhonghe Township, requested to join the Zhonghe Third Agricultural Production Cooperative, but the person in charge of the cooperative,嫌because her family lacked labor, used the excuse that her residence was too far from the cooperative (actually only a little over half a kilometer), making production and meetings inconvenient, and refused to let her join. Although she repeatedly assured them that she would not be absent from meetings and would not lag behind in production, the person in charge of the cooperative still said they needed to "consider it." Later, the district committee discovered this, and the problem was resolved. Another example is Gu Kunquan, a demobilized soldier from Yinbei Township, who lived alone. His land was originally managed by the township government on his behalf and later handed over to the Jianshe Agricultural Production Cooperative for cultivation. After he returned to his hometown, he repeatedly requested to join the cooperative; however, the cooperative actually said that he was "not strong enough and not good at agricultural production," refusing him entry. This problem was also resolved only after it was brought to the attention of the Production Cooperation Department of the Taicang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Generally, the families of martyrs and soldiers, military families, and demobilized soldiers have higher political awareness and sincerely support the Party's policy of mutual assistance and cooperation. Absorbing them into the cooperatives is not only conducive to the development of the agricultural collectivization movement, but also an active measure for doing a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. All erroneous practices that make things difficult for or exclude them from joining the cooperatives should be criticized and corrected.

### 不应当拒绝烈属军属和复员军人入社

    不应当拒绝烈属军属和复员军人入社编辑同志：
    “农业生产合作社示范章程草案”第十一条第二款规定，农业生产合作社应当积极地吸收复员军人和烈属、军属等入社，这是非常正确和必要的。从目前我县的情况来看，虽然大部分农业社都已经这样做了，但是也发生了一些排斥或留难烈属、军属和复员军人入社的事情。如中荷乡军属高凤娣要求参加中荷第三农业生产合作社，社里的负责人嫌她家劳力缺乏，就借口她住处离社太远（实际只一华里多些），生产和开会不便，不让她入社。她虽然一再保证开会不缺席，生产不落后，但是社里的负责人还是说要“考虑考虑”。后来区委发觉了，问题才得到解决。又如，印北乡复员军人顾坤泉，家中只有他一个人，土地原由乡政府代管，以后交给了建设农业生产合作社耕种。他复员回乡后几次要求入社；但是，社里竟说他“劳力不强，不善农业生产”，拒绝他入社。这个问题也是提到中共太仓县委生产合作部才得到了解决。
    烈属军属和复员军人一般的都是政治觉悟较高，对党的互助合作政策是热诚拥护的。吸收他们入社，不但有利于农业合作化运动的发展，而且也是做好拥军优属的一项积极措施。一切留难和排斥他们入社的错误作法都应该得到批判和纠正。
