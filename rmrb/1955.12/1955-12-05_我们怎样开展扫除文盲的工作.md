How We Conduct Literacy Work
Zhang Huaiying, Secretary of the CPC Xiyang County Committee, Shanxi Province

    With the arrival of the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, literacy education and agricultural technology learning for farmers must keep up closely to adapt to the development of the cooperative movement and the needs of production.

    In the past few years, we have paid attention to conducting spare-time education among farmers and have achieved considerable results. At present, 5,618 young and middle-aged people in Xiyang County have escaped illiteracy. They have played a significant role in managing cooperative affairs and improving agricultural technology. According to statistics, 567 of them have served as village cadres, 169 as cooperative directors, 134 as accountants, 708 as work-point recorders, and 177 as spare-time teachers. Since 1952, Sile Township has eliminated illiteracy for 220 people, including two who have served as the township's main cadres, 29 who have served as agricultural cooperative cadres and committee members, two who have served as accountants, and 81 who have served as labor group leaders and work-point recorders for the cooperative.

    However, the current work of eliminating illiteracy in rural areas is progressing slowly, far behind the agricultural cooperativization movement. From 1953 to the present, the number of illiterates eliminated in the county accounts for only 12.9% of the total number of illiterates in the county. Since the cooperative movement began on a trial basis in 1952, the number of households joining cooperatives has accounted for 72.8% of the total number of households in the county. Due to the leap forward in the cooperative movement, rural cultural work has become increasingly unable to meet the needs of cooperativization. Taking accounting work as an example, in 1952, five cooperatives were established in the county, and the five accountants were basically competent. In 1953, the number of cooperatives increased to 38, and the 38 accountants could still manage. In 1954, the number of cooperatives increased to 131, of which 36, accounting for about 28% of the total number of cooperatives, were unable to cope. This year, the number of cooperatives has increased to 459, of which 147, accounting for about 32% of the total number of cooperatives, are unable to cope. Because accounting work cannot keep up with the needs of cooperativization, the financial management of many cooperatives is very chaotic, and some cooperatives have failed to clear their accounts for two consecutive years. Renjia’nao Cooperative lost corn seeds due to incorrect accounts. When it was time to sow the seeds, they had to change 25 mu of high-yield corn crop land to planting mung beans, resulting in a yield of 80 jin less per mu than corn. More seriously, some bad elements often take advantage of the difficulty of agricultural production cooperatives lacking cultural talents to steal accounting positions and sabotage agricultural production cooperatives. In Dongfengren, reactionary rich peasant Tian Ensu pretended to be active in 1953 and stole the position of cooperative accountant. After that, he wantonly wasted and stole public property in the cooperative, which led to the collapse of the cooperative.

    Facts have proved that cooperatives cannot be run well without culture. Therefore, Xiyang County recently held a mass meeting to march toward culture, mobilizing the masses to work hard to learn culture and welcome the new upsurge of cooperativization. At the same time, a plan for eliminating illiteracy in the county was made, planning to eliminate 43,500 young, middle-aged, and cadre illiterates in the county by 1959.

    At present, the primary issues in carrying out literacy work are to strengthen leadership over this work, give play to the active role of the Communist Youth League, fully rely on and mobilize the masses, cherish the enthusiasm of farmers to learn culture, and be good at guiding farmers to transform this strong desire to learn culture into action, and take concrete measures to help farmers overcome difficulties in learning. When Xiyang County carried out a comprehensive plan for the county, district, and township this time, it also incorporated the plan for eliminating illiteracy, and required the township culture and education committees and agricultural production cooperatives and other relevant parties to cooperate with each other, unified arrangements for production and learning time, seriously solved the problem of farmers' learning time, and ensured that farmers have 350 hours of cultural learning each year. At the same time, the township culture and education committee should also seriously solve the problems of equipment for the people's schools, remuneration for volunteer teachers, and libraries.

    我们怎样开展扫除文盲的工作
    中共山西省昔阳县委书记　张怀英
    在农业合作化高潮到来的时候，农民的识字教育和农业技术学习必须紧紧跟上，才能适应合作化运动的发展和生产的需要。
    几年来，我们注意了在农民中进行业余教育的工作，并且取得了不少成绩。现在，昔阳县全县已经有五千六百一十八个青壮年摆脱了文盲状态，他们在管理社务工作上，在改进农业技术上都起了很大的作用。据统计，他们当中有五百六十七人担任了乡村干部，有一百六十九人担任了社长，一百三十四人担任了会计，七百零八人担任了记工员，一百七十七人担任了业余教师。思乐乡从一九五二年以来共扫除文盲二百二十人，其中有二人担任了乡的主要干部，有二十九人担任了农业合作社干部和社务委员，有二人担任了会计，八十一人担任了社的劳动组长和记工员。
    但是，现在农村的扫除文盲工作，进展还很缓慢，远远落在农业合作化运动的后面。从一九五三年到现在，全县扫除了的文盲仅占全县文盲总数的百分之十二点九。而合作化运动从一九五二年开始重点试办到现在，入社农户已占全县总农户的百分之七十二点八。由于合作化运动的跃进，农村文化工作已越来越不能适应合作化的需要了。单以会计工作来说，一九五二年全县共办了五个社，那时五个会计都基本上胜任；一九五三年发展为三十八个社，三十八个会计都还可以凑合；一九五四年发展为一百三十一个社，其中有三十六个社约占总社数的百分之二十八的会计不能胜任；今年发展为四百五十九个社，其中有一百四十七个社约占总社数的百分之三十二的会计不能胜任。由于会计工作赶不上合作化的需要，不少社的财务管理弄得很混乱，有个别社连续二年算不清账。任家垴社因为闹错了账，少收了玉蜀黍种子，在临下种子的时候，不得不把二十五亩玉蜀黍高产作物地改种小豆，结果每亩比玉蜀黍少收八十斤。更严重的是，有些坏分子常常利用农业生产合作社缺乏文化人材的困难，窃取会计职务，破坏农业生产合作社。东丰稔，反动富农田恩素在一九五三年伪装积极，窃取了社的会计职务之后，大肆浪费和盗窃社内的公共财物，以致使这个合作社陷于垮台的状态。
    事实证明，没有文化是不能办好合作社的。因此，昔阳县最近举行了一次群众性的向文化进军的大会，动员群众努力学习文化，迎接合作化的新高潮。同时，作出全县扫除文盲规划，计划到一九五九年扫除全县青、壮年和干部文盲计四万三千五百多名。
    目前开展扫除文盲工作，首要的问题是加强对这一工作的领导，发挥青年团的积极作用，充分依靠和发动群众，爱护农民学习文化的积极性，并且善于引导农民将这种学文化的强烈要求变成行动，以及采取具体措施，帮助农民克服学习上的困难。昔阳县在这次进行县、区、乡全面规划的时候，也把扫除文盲工作规划进去，并要求乡文教委员会和农业生产合作社等有关的方面互相配合，统一安排生产和学习时间，认真解决农民学习时间问题，保证农民每年有三百五十个小时学习文化。同时，乡文教委员会还要认真解决民校的设备、义务教师的报酬、图书阅览室等问题。
