Further Develop the Socialist Transformation of Urban Private Commerce

In the past six months or so, the socialist transformation of urban private commerce by the state has made considerable progress. According to statistics from 32 large and medium-sized cities across the country, nearly half of private businesses have been incorporated into various forms of state capitalism. Socialist commerce and state-capitalist commerce now occupy three-quarters of the urban commercial retail front. In terms of industry, unified purchase and sales commodities have implemented wholesale and consignment sales across the entire industry; department stores, cultural and educational supplies, meat, petroleum, coal, and other industries of greater importance to the national economy and people's livelihoods have all or mostly implemented wholesale and consignment sales across the entire industry. Among the major industries, the transformation of vegetables, Chinese medicine, groceries, and the catering industry is relatively poor.

After the arrangements and transformation of urban private commerce in the spring and summer of 1955, the operational difficulties of private commerce have been alleviated. Most private retail businesses in cities have been able to maintain themselves, some stores have made profits, and a few larger stores have made more profits due to good locations, large capital, and a wide variety of goods. In the arrangements and transformation, the attitude of commercial capitalists is generally willing to accept transformation. Some activists have played a backbone role in promoting socialist transformation; however, some people still have a passive attitude of waiting for arrangements; and a few people have engaged in illegal acts that resist socialist transformation, such as withdrawing funds, evading taxes, raising prices, adulterating goods, cutting corners, and dismissing active employees. The vast majority of store employees and workers actively welcome the transformation of private commerce and have played a significant role in improving store management, reducing costs, and supervising the illegal activities of capitalists. Among the urban private businesses, there are also many small merchants and peddlers (family stores and vendors). They generally welcome wholesale and consignment sales, and most people support the methods of organizing cooperative stores and cooperative groups. Some cities have already organized a number of cooperative stores and cooperative groups.

These situations indicate that the method of incorporating all private retailers into wholesale and consignment sales is correct. However, only using wholesale and consignment sales methods can no longer adapt to the needs of the current objective situation. Now, a comprehensive plan for transforming private commerce should be made.

Localities have created two different transitional forms for the socialist transformation of urban capitalist stores. Among them, the best transitional form for the socialist transformation of capitalist retail stores is to transition to state-owned commerce through industry-wide joint state-private ownership. In the past, many places had created experience in individual store joint state-private ownership. The experience of industry-wide joint state-private ownership has further developed and enriched in the second half of this year due to the implementation of industry-wide joint ownership of private cotton cloth stores in Beijing, industry-wide joint ownership of woolen yarn stores in Shanghai's Songshan District, and industry-wide joint ownership of the pastry industry in Tianjin.

The content of industry-wide joint state-private ownership is: (1) Under the leadership of the city's Commercial Bureau, enrich and strengthen the original state-owned specialized companies, making them the general leading institutions for state-owned retail stores (including consumer cooperatives), joint state-private retail stores, cooperative stores, cooperative groups, and private retail stores in a city or several industries. It becomes a work team to promote and organize private commerce into joint state-private commerce or cooperative stores and cooperative groups. Through the leadership and promotion of specialized companies, the demands of the broad masses of employees, the assistance of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Democratic National Construction Association, and trade associations, and the activities of some activists among capitalists, a portion of commodities is invested by state-owned commerce as capital, and all capitalist stores in the entire industry are organized into joint state-private stores. In places where the strength of state-owned specialized companies is insufficient, new specialized companies can be established to undertake the leadership of transformation work. (2) All capital owned by capitalists is converted into shares in joint state-private stores at a discounted price, and fixed dividends are given according to the shares, and no other profits are distributed. (3) After industry-wide joint state-private ownership, the setting of urban retail commercial networks should be based on the performance of commodities and the needs of consumers. Under the principles of convenient consumer purchase and economic accounting, a comprehensive plan should be made to gradually change the current unreasonable state of urban retail commercial network settings. This industry-wide joint state-private ownership can completely incorporate all capitalist stores in the entire industry into the track of the national plan. It will thoroughly change the situation of the big fish eating the small fish in the past capitalist commerce, and thoroughly plan the social commercial network according to socialist methods, according to the principle of large leading small, and advanced leading backward. This method is very beneficial to the vast urban consumers, to all employees in capitalist stores, and to all employer practitioners.

In addition to the form of joint state-private ownership, the form of directly changing capitalist stores into state-owned commerce through consignment sales can also be adopted. This form includes the following contents: (1) Capitalist stores sell all or most of the commodities operated by state-owned commerce on consignment, and the capitalist's working capital is deposited in the People's Bank or transferred to the joint state-private investment company in the form of a security deposit, giving interest or fixed dividends. (2) State-owned commerce sends representatives to participate in the leadership and supervision of business management, and a business management committee is jointly organized by representatives of state-owned commerce, representatives of capitalists, and representatives of employees. After a period of time, the consignment store is changed into a state-owned store, the state leases its suitable equipment, and employs its staff. In Tianjin, 29 grain consignment stores have been directly changed into state-owned stores through this form.

In cities, in addition to capitalist stores, there are also many small merchants and peddlers. The socialist transformation of them should be different from that of capitalist stores.

Different methods can be adopted to transform the seated merchants among small merchants and peddlers. In industries such as cotton cloth, large department stores, and hardware, the method of absorbing them into joint state-private stores can be adopted, which is the method adopted by Beijing when organizing industry-wide joint state-private ownership of cotton cloth. In industries such as vegetables, slaughtering, and catering, there are few capitalist stores, mainly small merchants and peddlers, and the capital is generally relatively small. Their transformation can take the method of uniting several or more small stores under the leadership of state-owned specialized companies to organize cooperative stores, which is the method adopted by Chongqing to organize more than 190 slaughtering industries across the entire industry. In addition, other appropriate forms can be adopted according to the specific situation of seated merchants among small merchants and peddlers in various cities to carry out socialist transformation.

The socialist transformation of vendors can generally organize them through cooperative groups and transition to shop assistants or state-owned vendors in state-owned commerce after a period of time. Among urban vendors, some people are suitable for retaining the cooperative group form for a longer period of time (such as mobile food vendors), and can also be retained for a longer period of time without rushing to transform them into state-owned stores or state-owned vendors; some very dispersed fixed vendors and mobile vendors who operate retail commodities can also slow down and organize them later. Before carrying out socialist transformation of vendors, the vendor market should be rectified by industry and region.

At present, there are still some small wholesalers and secondary wholesalers who have not been transformed, and some wholesale business practitioners who have been replaced have not been absorbed and placed. The transformation of these wholesalers should be carried out simultaneously with the transformation of retailers. When carrying out the socialist transformation of small wholesalers, attention should be paid to continuing to give play to the role of this small wholesale form in commodity circulation. The existing urban small wholesale markets, such as Beijing's Dongxiao City, should be retained through joint state-private ownership or other forms so that it can continue to play a role in urban-rural exchanges, and do not rush to change this small wholesale form.

When transforming private commerce, we must pay equal attention to quality and quantity. We must ensure that industries that have been transformed not only do not reduce the variety of goods they operate, but also increase the variety of goods they operate, especially the retail goods that were purchased by private merchants and peddlers in the past. State-owned stores, joint state-private stores, cooperative stores, and cooperative groups should also continue to purchase; not only should the quality of service to consumers not be reduced, but the quality of service to consumers should be improved; not only should it not hinder the expansion of commodity circulation, but it should be conducive to expanding commodity circulation. Therefore, when starting to transform an industry, it must be investigated and studied in advance, a thorough arrangement must be made, and full preparation work must be done; during and after the transformation process, the quality of the transformation work must be carefully checked, and necessary systems must be stipulated. The original system of private stores that is conducive to expanding commodity circulation and improving service quality should be retained and should not be cancelled.

The socialist transformation of private commerce conforms to the requirements of the people of the whole country and the provisions of the Constitution. It is the general trend and is inevitable. However, it will inevitably encounter ideological resistance from some capitalists. Therefore, both before and during the transformation process of joint state-private ownership, in-depth political work must be carried out to combine the transformation of enterprises with the ideological transformation of people. Before joint state-private ownership, propaganda and education work must be fully carried out to capitalists and their agents, and activists must be cultivated and selected among them to play a certain backbone role. After joint state-private ownership, they should be given appropriate jobs, and they should be approached frequently. If they encounter difficulties in their work, they should be assisted in solving them; if they have made achievements in their work, they should be encouraged; if they have shortcomings, they should be sincerely criticized and educated; if they have strengths, they should learn from them with humility; they should be helped to learn to adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism to correct their shortcomings and obtain more transformation and greater progress. The transformation of small merchants and peddlers should be done through persuasion and education. For those who are indeed unwilling to participate in joint state-private ownership or are unwilling to organize for a while, they should be patiently waited for. At present, do not rush to force them to participate. The supply of goods should be continued to them, and they should be allowed to sell and sell state-owned company commodities on consignment. After the industry-wide joint ownership has been basically realized, the problems of these few unwilling people will be easier to solve. Of course, we must be vigilant and prevent the sabotage activities of a few counter-revolutionary elements during the transformation process.

Carrying out the socialist transformation of private commerce across the entire industry is an extremely arduous and complex task. All leading cadres of state-owned commerce and all employees of public and private commerce must strengthen unity, study hard, and fully prepare themselves to do a good job in a series of political and economic work. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee and the government, all localities must carry out comprehensive planning, proceed in a planned, step-by-step, and phased manner, and avoid all possible errors and losses.

### 进一步开展对城市私营商业的社会主义改造工作

    进一步开展对城市私营商业的社会主义改造工作
    近半年多来，国家对城市私营商业的社会主义改造工作，已经有了相当的进展。据全国三十二个大中城市的统计，已经有接近半数的私营商业分别纳入了各种形式的国家资本主义轨道，社会主义性质的商业和国家资本主义性质的商业已经占领了城市商业零售阵地的四分之三。从行业上来看，统购统销商品已经实行了全行业的经销、代销；百货、文化教育用品、肉类、石油、煤炭等关系国计民生较重大的行业已全部或大部分实行了全行业的经销、代销；在主要行业中，对蔬菜、国药、杂货和公共饮食业的改造工作较差。
    经过了一九五五年春、夏对城市私营商业的安排和改造，私营商业经营的困难情况已减轻，多数城市的私营零售商业已能够维持，一部分商店获得了利润，少数较大的商店由于地段好、资本多、花色品种多，还获得了较多的利润。在安排和改造中，商业资本家的态度一般是愿意接受改造的。其中一部分积极分子，还在推动社会主义改造的工作上，起了骨干作用；但还有一部分人存在着坐待安排的消极情绪；还有少数人有抽逃资金、偷税漏税、抬价出售、掺假掺杂、偷工减料，以及开除店员积极分子等抗拒社会主义改造的违法行为。广大店员职工是积极地欢迎对私营商业的改造，在改善商店的经营管理、降低费用、监督资本家违法行为方面起了不小作用。在城市私营商业中，还有为数很多的小商小贩（夫妻店和摊贩），他们对经销、代销一般是欢迎的，多数人对组织合作商店和合作小组的办法是拥护的，有些城市已经组织了一部分合作商店和合作小组。
    这些情况说明，把私营零售商全行业纳入经销、代销的办法是正确的，但是只采用经销、代销办法已经不能适应目前客观形势的需要，现在应该进一步做出改造私营商业的全面规划了。
    各地对城市资本家商店的社会主义改造，已经创造了两种不同的过渡形式。其中对资本家零售商店进行社会主义改造最好的一种过渡形式就是通过全行业的公私合营过渡到国营商业。过去曾经有过不少地方创造过个别商店公私合营的经验，全行业公私合营的经验，在今年下半年由于北京市实行了私营棉布店的全行业合营，上海嵩山区实行绒线店的全行业合营，天津市实行了糕点业的全行业合营，才进一步发展和丰富起来。
    全行业公私合营的内容是：（一）在城市商业局领导下，充实和加强原有的国营专业公司，使它成为这个城市中一个行业或者几个行业的国营零售商店（包括消费合作社），公私合营零售商店，合作商店、合作小组和私营零售店的总领导机构，成为推动和组织私营商业成为公私合营商业或合作商店、合作小组的工作队。通过专业公司的领导、推动，广大职工群众的要求，工商业联合会、民主建国会和同业公会的协助和资本家中间一部分积极分子的活动，由国营商业投入一部分商品作为资金，把全行业的资本家商店都组织成为公私合营商店。在国营专业公司力量不足的地方，可以成立新的专业公司来担负领导改造工作。（二）资本家所有的资本，一律折价在公私合营商店入股，按股给以固定股息，其他盈余不再分红。（三）在全行业公私合营以后，对城市零售商业网的设置，应根据商品的性能和消费者的需要，在便利消费者购买和考虑到适合于经济核算的原则下，进行全盘的规划，以求逐步改变目前城市零售商业网设置不合理的状态。这种全行业的公私合营，可以将全行业的一切资本家商店，完全纳入国家计划的轨道，它将彻底改变过去资本主义商业中大鱼吃小鱼的情况，彻底地根据社会主义的办法，按照以大带小，以先进带落后的原则来全盘规划社会商业网。这种办法，对广大的城市消费者，对资本家商店中的全体职工，以及对于一切资方从业人员，都非常有利。
    除了公私合营的形式以外，通过代销把资本家商店直接改为国营商业的形式也是可以采取的。这种形式包括以下内容：（一）资本家商店全部或绝大部分代销国营商业经营的商品，资本家的流动资金以保证金形式存入人民银行或转入公私合营投资公司，给以利息或定额股息。（二）由国营商业派代表参加经营管理的领导并进行监督，并由国营商业代表、资方代表和职工代表共同组织经营管理委员会，经过一个时期后，把代销商店改为国营商店，由国家租用其合用的设备，录用其工作人员。在天津，已经有二十九家粮食代销店通过这种形式直接改成了国营商店。
    在城市中，除了资本家商店外，还有着人数很多的小商小贩。对于他们进行社会主义改造，应当同资本家商店有所不同。
    对小商小贩中间的座商，可以分别采取不同的办法进行改造。在棉布、大百货、五金等行业中，可以采取吸收他们加入公私合营商店的办法，这是北京组织棉布全行业公私合营时所采取的办法。在蔬菜、屠牲、饮食等行业中，资本家商店很少，主要是小商小贩，资本一般比较小，对他们的改造，可以采取在国营专业公司的领导下，把几户或更多户数的小商店联合起来，组织成为合作商店的办法，这是重庆市把屠牲业全行业一百九十多家组织起来所采取的办法。此外，还可以根据各城市小商小贩中间座商的具体情况，采取其他适宜的形式，进行社会主义改造。
    对摊贩的社会主义改造，一般可以通过合作小组的方式把他们组织起来，经过一个时期，过渡为国营商业的店员或国营摊贩。在城市摊贩中，有一部分人适宜于较长期地保留合作小组形式（例如饮食业流动摊贩），也可以较长期地保留，不必急于改造成为国营商店或国营摊贩；有些经营零星商品的很分散的固定摊贩和流动摊贩，也可以放缓一步再去组织。在对摊贩进行社会主义改造以前，应当对摊贩市场分行业、分地区地进行整顿工作。
    目前还有一部分小批发商和二批发商尚未进行改造，有些已经代替了的批发商业从业人员尚未吸收安置。对这些批发商的改造，应当和对零售商的改造同时进行。在进行对小批发商的社会主义改造的时候，应当注意继续发挥这种小批发形式在商品流转上的作用，现有的城市小批发市场，例如北京的东晓市，应当通过公私合营的形式或其他形式把它保留下来，使之继续在城乡交流上发挥作用，不要急于去改变这种小批发形式。
    在改造私营商业的时候，要做到质和量并重。要做到已经经过改造的行业，不仅不减少经营商品的品种，而且增加经营商品的品种，特别是过去由私商、小贩去采购的零星商品，国营商店、公私合营商店和合作社商店、合作小组也应当同样去继续采购；不仅不应该降低对消费者服务的质量，而且应该提高对消费者服务的质量；不仅不应该妨碍商品流转的扩大，而且应该有利于扩大商品流转。因此，在着手改造一个行业的时候，必须事先经过调查研究，进行周密的布置，经过充分的准备工作；在改造过程中和改造完毕以后，必须对改造工作的质量，进行详细的检查，规定必要的制度，对于私营商店原有的制度中有利于扩大商品流转和提高服务质量的部分应加以保留，不应取消。
    对私营商业实行社会主义改造，符合于全国人民的要求和宪法的规定，是大势所趋，势所必至的。但是，它还不可避免地会遇到某些资本家的思想抵触。因此，在公私合营以前和进行改造的过程中，都必须进行深入的政治工作，把企业的改造和人的思想改造结合起来。在公私合营以前，要对资本家和他们的代理人充分地进行宣传教育工作，并在他们中间培养和选拔积极分子，使他们起一定的骨干作用。在公私合营以后，要给他们以适当的工作岗位，经常同他们接近，他们在工作中遇有困难，要协助解决；他们工作做得有成绩，要给以鼓励；他们有缺点，要诚恳地对他们进行批评和教育，他们有长处，要虚心地向他们学习；要帮助他们学会采取批评和自我批评的方法，来改正自己的缺点，获得更多的改造和更大的进步。对小商小贩的改造，更应当采取说服教育的办法，对于确实一时不愿参加公私合营或者不愿组织起来的少数人，应当耐心地等待一下，目前不要急于强制他们参加，对于他们照旧供应货源，让他们经销、代销国营公司的商品。等到全行业合营已经基本实现以后，这些不愿参加的少数人的问题，也就比较容易解决了。当然，我们必须提高警惕，防范在改造过程中少数反革命分子的破坏活动。
    对私营商业进行全行业的社会主义改造，是一项极为艰巨、复杂的任务。一切国营商业的领导干部和公私商业的全体职工，都必须加强团结，认真学习，充分地做好准备，做好一系列的政治工作和经济工作。各地必须在党委和政府的统一领导下，进行全面规划，有计划、有步骤、分期分批地进行，避免一切可能发生的错误和损失。
