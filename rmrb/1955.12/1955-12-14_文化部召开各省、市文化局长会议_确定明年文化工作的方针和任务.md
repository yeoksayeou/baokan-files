Xinhua News Agency, 13th December. The Ministry of Culture convened a meeting of provincial and municipal cultural bureau chiefs in Beijing from the 6th to the 13th of December. At the meeting, the representatives, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, reviewed the achievements and shortcomings of cultural work in 1955, discussed the guiding principles, tasks, and plans for cultural work in 1956, and proposed a comprehensive plan for rural cultural work to serve the upsurge of agricultural collectivization and the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The representatives attending the meeting successively listened to the report by Qian Junrui, Acting Minister of Culture, on "The Implementation of the 1955 Cultural Work Plan and the Guiding Principles and Tasks of Cultural Work for 1956," and the report by Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, on "Comprehensive Planning and Strengthening Leadership of Rural Cultural Work," and conducted enthusiastic group discussions and plenary speeches. Qian Junrui delivered a summary report on the 13th.

The representatives from various provinces, cities, and individual counties unanimously reflected the urgent cultural demands of the workers and peasants and the general upsurge of mass cultural and artistic activities in various regions; they introduced many advanced experiences in cultural work in various places that are worth promoting, especially the experience of establishing rural clubs and implementing socialist transformation of private cultural enterprises.

After discussion, the meeting held that the national cultural work in 1956 should adopt the guiding principle of "actively developing, improving quality, comprehensive planning, and strengthening leadership," vigorously develop literary and artistic creation and mass cultural undertakings in factories, mines, and rural areas, continue to strengthen artistic practice, accelerate the socialist transformation of private cultural enterprises, basically complete the overall arrangement of public and private cultural undertakings, continue to criticize bourgeois ideology and rectify the cultural ranks, and strive to implement the enterprise management of cultural undertakings to improve the quality of cultural work. The meeting pointed out that the key to implementing this guiding principle lies in strengthening leadership. The serious criticism and self-criticism conducted by the representatives showed that there were serious problems in the leadership work of the Ministry of Culture and the cultural bureaus of various provinces and cities, such as ideological lag behind reality and leadership detached from the masses. The reasons for this situation are insufficient understanding of the transition from the new democratic revolution to the socialist revolution; lack of a mass viewpoint, detachment from reality; and the existence of subjective idealism in leadership work and a bureaucratic work style. The meeting held that the way to overcome this backward situation is to comprehensively plan and get close to the masses. Those who assume leadership roles must go down in batches to inspect work, go deep among the masses, contact reality, and ensure smooth communication between higher and lower levels. Special attention should be paid to summarizing and promoting the advanced experiences constantly emerging from the masses, which is the decisive link in overcoming the leadership's lagging behind the masses. The meeting pointed out that the comprehensive planning of cultural work must be based on economic development and the general conditions of politics and culture. The formulation of plans should adopt advanced experiences and advanced quotas. In order to do a good job in planning, it is necessary to strengthen the study of the Party's policies and a comprehensive understanding of the situation. In the development of cultural undertakings, attention should be paid to the combination of quantity and quality, and the development should be planned and prepared, adhering to the mass line, enriching content, and improving quality; after development, attention should be paid to consolidation, compared with quality.

The meeting pointed out that the prosperity of literary and artistic creation is crucial to the development of the entire cultural work. It is necessary to correct the erroneous idea that cultural administrative departments can ignore literary and artistic creation, and must be good at vigorously guiding creation according to the laws of literary and artistic creation. Cultural administrative departments should closely cooperate with literary federations and literary and artistic associations at all levels, resolutely adopt the mass line, mobilize and organize professional writers, amateur writers, especially young writers and the vast creative forces in society, to jointly promote creation. Cultural departments should also better organize and help writers and artists go to factories and rural areas; correctly carry out literary and artistic criticism; set up bonuses and honorary titles; reduce the excessive social activities and administrative work of professional writers; and vigorously improve literary and artistic publications to make them the property of the broad masses. The meeting emphasized that literary and artistic creation should require the unity of socialist content and national form, and special emphasis should be placed on advocating works that reflect real life. The meeting conducted a serious criticism of bourgeois ideas such as neglecting national cultural heritage and the separation of literature and art from politics, and decided that the struggle against bourgeois ideology must continue to be carried out in depth and systematically in the future. The meeting also further emphasized the importance of organizing performing troupes to tour and hold various large and small performances in accordance with local conditions and time through the exchange of experiences, and especially affirmed that strengthening the enterprise management of cultural undertakings is an important way to promote the development of art and improve artistic practice.

The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to cooperate with the upsurge of agricultural collectivization and the literacy campaign, comprehensively plan and vigorously carry out rural cultural work, and develop a large number of rural cultural undertakings centered on the rural club network in a planned and step-by-step manner - film projection network, slide network, book and periodical distribution network, book circulation network, art troupe network, radio broadcasting network, cultural center and station network. The meeting pointed out that the rural club is a comprehensive amateur cultural and artistic activity organization in the countryside, a position for developing socialist ideology, and an important link in the Party's propaganda network, which must be vigorously developed. The activities of the club should be closely integrated with production and central work, and should try to meet the requirements of the peasant masses for cultural life, the activities should be diverse, attracting the vast peasant masses to voluntarily and happily participate in the activities. The development of clubs should start from the foundation of existing mass cultural activities, and the specifications should not be forced to be uniform, can be large or small, simple or complex, but should be gradually consolidated and improved. The meeting pointed out that the working methods of the district cultural stations should be improved to give play to its role in guiding mass cultural activities, and gradually transform them into the central clubs in rural areas. The county cultural centers should also improve and improve work efficiency and the quality of cadres, and strengthen the guidance of rural cultural activities throughout the county.

The meeting also studied the issue of accelerating the socialist transformation of private cultural undertakings, and determined some guiding principles and methods for the transformation work. In addition, it also discussed the unity and ideological transformation of cultural workers, and the development of cultural undertakings in minority areas. The meeting held that it is necessary to comprehensively plan the cultural and artistic work in minority areas, and strengthen the work of filming and translating films in minority languages and publishing books and periodicals in minority languages.

    文化部召开各省、市文化局长会议
    确定明年文化工作的方针和任务
    新华社十三日讯　文化部从六日到十三日在北京召开了各省、市文化局长会议。在这次会议上，到会的代表根据批评与自我批评的精神，检查了一九五五年文化工作的成绩和缺点，讨论了一九五六年文化工作的方针、任务和计划，并且提出了配合农业合作化高潮、为农业的社会主义改造服务的农村文化工作全面规划。
    参加会议的代表先后听了文化部代理部长钱俊瑞所作的“一九五五年文化工作计划执行情况和一九五六年文化工作的方针任务”的报告和文化部副部长刘芝明所作的“关于农村文化工作的全面规划和加强领导”的报告，并且进行了热烈的小组讨论和大会发言。十三日由钱俊瑞作总结报告。
    参加会议的各省、市和个别县的代表一致反映工农群众对文化要求的迫切和各地群众文化艺术活动的普遍高涨；介绍了各地文化工作中许多值得推广的先进经验，特别是关于建立农村俱乐部和对于私营文化企业实行社会主义改造的经验。
    会议经过讨论，认为一九五六年全国文化工作应当采取“积极发展，提高质量，全面规划，加强领导”的方针，大力发展文艺创作和工矿、农村的群众文化事业，继续加强艺术实践，加速进行私营文化企业的社会主义改造，基本上完成对公私文化事业的统筹安排，继续批判资产阶级思想和整顿文化队伍，努力实行文化事业企业化，提高文化工作的质量。会议指出，贯彻这一方针的关键在于加强领导。到会代表所进行的严肃的批评与自我批评，说明文化部和各省、市文化局的领导工作中存在着思想落后于实际和领导脱离群众的严重情况。产生这种情况的原因是对于从新民主主义革命到社会主义革命的转变认识不足；缺乏群众观点，脱离实际；领导工作中存在着主观主义的思想方法和官僚主义的工作作风。会议认为，克服这种落后状况的办法就是全面规划，接近群众。担任领导工作的人必须分批地下去检查工作，深入群众，接触实际，使上下通气。应该特别注意总结和推广群众中不断涌现的先进经验，这是克服领导落后于群众的决定性的环节。会议指出，文化工作的全面规划，必须以经济发展和政治、文化的一般条件为根据。制定规划要采用先进经验和先进定额。为了做好规划，必须加强对党的方针政策的学习和对全面情况的了解。在文化事业的发展中，应当注意数量和质量的结合，发展中要有计划、有准备，坚持群众路线，充实内容和提高质量；发展后要注意巩固，比质量。
    会议指出，文艺创作的繁荣是对于整个文化工作的发展具有关键性的。必须纠正认为文化行政部门可以不管文艺创作的错误思想，并且要善于根据文艺创作的规律来大力指导创作。文化行政部门应密切协同各级文联和文艺界各协会，坚决采取群众路线，发动和组织职业作家、业余作家，特别是青年作家和社会上广大的创作力量，共同繁荣创作。文化部门还应当更好地组织和帮助作家和艺术家下厂下乡；正确地开展文艺批评；设置奖金和荣誉称号；减轻专业作家过多的社会活动和行政工作；大力改进文艺刊物，使它成为广大群众自己的东西。会议强调指出，对于文艺创作应该要求社会主义内容和民族形式的统一，应当特别着重提倡反映现实生活的作品。会议对轻视民族文化遗产、文艺脱离政治等资产阶级思想进行了严肃的批判，并且决定今后必须继续深入地系统地开展反对资产阶级思想的斗争。会上还通过交流经验，进一步强调了组织表演团体巡回演出和因地因时制宜地举办各种大型、小型会演的重要性，特别肯定了加强文艺事业企业化是推动艺术事业发展和提高艺术实践的重要办法。
    会议指出，必须配合农业合作化的高潮和扫盲运动，全面规划并且大力开展农村文化工作，有计划、有步骤地大量发展以农村俱乐部网为中心的农村文化事业网——电影放映网、幻灯网、书刊发行网、图书流通网、艺术团体网、广播收音网、文化馆站网。会议指出，农村俱乐部是农村中综合性的业余文艺活动组织，是发展社会主义思想的阵地，是党的宣传网的重要环节，必须大力发展。俱乐部的活动应该同生产和中心工作密切结合，要尽量满足农民群众对文化生活的要求，活动应多种多样，吸引广大农民群众自愿地、高兴地参加活动。发展俱乐部应从原有群众文化活动的基础出发，规格不宜强求一律，可大可小，可简可繁，但是要逐步巩固和提高。会议指出，应当改进区文化站的工作方法，发挥它的辅导群众文化活动的作用，逐步转为农村的中心俱乐部。县文化馆也应该改进并提高工作效率和干部质量，加强对全县农村文化活动的辅导。
    这次会议还研究了加速进行对私营文化事业的社会主义改造的问题，确定了某些改造工作的方针和办法。此外，还讨论了文化工作者的团结和思想改造，发展少数民族地区的文化事业等问题。会议认为，必须全面规划少数民族地区的文化艺术工作，并且加强用少数民族语言摄制、译制影片和用少数民族语文出版书刊的工作。
