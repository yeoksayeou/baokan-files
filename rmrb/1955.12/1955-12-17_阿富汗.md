Afghanistan

Chen Ruhou

The Kingdom of Afghanistan is located in the southwest of Central Asia, covering an area of 650,000 square kilometers with a population of 12 million. It is a multi-ethnic country, with the vast majority of residents practicing Islam.

For a long historical period in the past, Afghanistan was the target of contention among feudal emperors of Iran and Central Asia. In 1747, the people of various Afghan tribes revolted, expelled the Iranian invaders, and established the country. However, in the early 19th century, Afghanistan was repeatedly subjected to invasions by British colonialists, and in 1878, it was forced to sign unequal treaties. In 1919, Britain launched the third Anglo-Afghan War. This time, Afghanistan's struggle against British aggression was supported by the newly born Soviet state, and the British intervention forces were defeated in the Soviet state. Therefore, Britain had to end the war and recognize Afghanistan's independence.

Afghanistan is a constitutional monarchy. The current king is Mohammed Zahir. According to the Afghan constitution, legislative power belongs to the parliament composed of the king, the Senate, and the National Assembly. The Senate has 25 life-term senators appointed by the king; the National Assembly has 172 members, who are elected.

Afghanistan's natural resources are abundant. Underground, there are large deposits of gold, silver, oil, coal, copper, iron, tin, lead, asbestos, zinc, chromium, and other minerals. Afghanistan also has huge hydropower resources.

The economic base of Afghanistan is mainly agriculture and animal husbandry. Agricultural products mainly include grains, cotton, and oil crops. Animal husbandry ranks second in the national economy. Herdsmen account for about one-third of the national population. Livestock products account for 80% of total exports.

After Afghanistan's independence in 1919, some social reforms were taken domestically, abolishing internal tariffs, depriving the nobility of the right to collect national taxes, and recovering the land of church organizations. However, at present, nearly 80% of the country's land is still concentrated in the hands of nobles, landlords, and merchants.

The economic and national industries of Afghanistan had just begun to develop when they were hit by foreign monopoly capital. At present, there are more than 70 factories in Afghanistan, including textile, cotton ginning, woolen, match, shoe, sugar, and canned fruit factories, with more than 150,000 urban workers. The need for industrial products largely relies on imports.

The various ethnic groups in Afghanistan created a brilliant culture and art very early on. After independence, Afghanistan gradually developed modern education. Kabul University, founded in 1932, includes six departments: medicine, literature, mathematics, science, and law. It is the main cultural center of Afghanistan, with 750 students.

The Afghan government pursues an independent and peaceful foreign policy. This policy is based on establishing good neighborly relations with other countries. In April 1954, Afghan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Naim Khan stated that Afghanistan supports the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Afghanistan has repeatedly expressed its opposition to the US-Pakistan military alliance and the Baghdad Pact. Afghanistan, along with other countries, actively participated in the Asian-African Conference attended by 29 countries. The Afghan Foreign Minister, on his way back from the Asian-African Conference in early May this year, emphasized that Afghanistan "hopes to have good relations with all peace-loving people in Asian and African countries and with the people of other countries," advocating strengthening economic and cultural ties between Asian and African countries. At the United Nations meetings, Afghanistan actively supported many proposals that are conducive to maintaining peace and opposing colonialism.

The Chinese people and the Afghan people have a long history of friendship. Since the Han Dynasty, our people have been in constant contact with the various ethnic groups in Afghanistan, exchanging economic and cultural ideas. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Afghan Foreign Minister sent a telegram to our country in January 1950, recognizing the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government. In January 1955, China and Afghanistan officially established normal diplomatic relations.

Afghanistan and its neighbor, the Soviet Union, have always had close friendship. In May 1919, shortly after Afghanistan declared its independence, the Soviet government recognized Afghanistan's complete independence. In February 1921, the Soviet Union and Afghanistan concluded a treaty of friendship and established diplomatic and commercial relations. In 1926, the two countries signed a non-aggression treaty. This treaty consolidated the friendly relations between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. In June 1946, the Soviet Union and Afghanistan concluded a new border agreement. According to the new border agreement, the Soviet-Afghan border line would no longer be divided along the left bank of the Amu Darya River as stipulated in the 1873 agreement, but along the center line of the river, thus giving the Afghan government the right to use 1,250 kilometers of the Amu Darya River for navigation and irrigation. Kabul newspapers commented on the agreement: "This is the best proof of the Soviet Union's goodwill towards our beloved country. We fully support this agreement and sincerely thank the Soviet government."

The Soviet Union and Afghanistan have close economic relations. Before World War II, the Soviet Union provided great assistance to the development of Afghanistan's industrial and agricultural economy. During the world economic panic from 1929 to 1933, world market prices plummeted. Based on the principle of mutual benefit, the Soviet Union gave fair prices to Afghanistan's exports, sparing Afghanistan from the disastrous impact of the world economic crisis. Multiple trade agreements were signed in 1936, 1940, and 1950. The volume of trade between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan has been increasing in recent years. In Afghanistan's efforts to develop a modern economy, the Soviet Union has provided much technical and financial assistance. With the help of Soviet experts, Afghanistan established the largest cotton ginning factory in the country in Kunduz City. The Soviet Union is also helping Afghanistan build two granaries equipped with machinery, a flour mill, and a machine bread factory. These factories make it possible for Afghanistan to improve the bread supply to its residents and establish domestic grain facilities. To ease the difficulty of repaying for this machine equipment, the Soviet Union selflessly provided Afghanistan with a low-interest loan of US$3.5 million. In October 1954, the Soviet Union and Afghanistan signed an agreement, under which the Soviet Union loaned US$2.1 million to Afghanistan to pave the streets of Kabul. In November of the same year, the two parties signed another trade protocol. According to this protocol, the Soviet Union will supply Afghanistan with petroleum products, hardware, sugar, cotton fabrics, automobiles, machines, and other items. The Soviet Union will import wool, cotton, leather, dried fruits, and oilseed crops from Afghanistan. Since the beginning of this year, the two countries have successively signed an agreement on the exchange of postal parcels and a treaty on the free transport of all goods between the two parties. Afghan newspapers pointed out: These agreements will not only help promote the close friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union, but also promote the economic development of Afghanistan. The Afghan asphalt and concrete mixing plant built with Soviet technical assistance has begun production in May this year.

Cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan have also developed. At the end of 1953, an Afghan delegation visited the Soviet Union. In December 1954, a delegation of Soviet cultural workers headed by V.V. Talyzin, academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, paid a friendly visit to Afghanistan.

The increase in this kind of economic and cultural relationship between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan is entirely based on equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation. They are of great significance to enhancing the traditional friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Afghanistan and promoting international peace and cooperation. Now, Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev are paying a friendly visit to Afghanistan, which will greatly promote the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan and contribute to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    阿富汗
    陈汝厚
    阿富汗王国位于中央亚细亚的西南部，面积六十五万方公里，人口一千二百万人。它是一个多民族的国家，绝大部分居民信奉回教。
    在过去的一个很长的历史时期里，阿富汗是伊朗及中亚细亚封建帝王争夺的目标。一七四七年，阿富汗各部族人民起义，驱逐了伊朗侵略者，建成了国家。但是，十九世纪初，阿富汗又一再遭受了英国殖民者的侵略，并在一八七八年强迫阿富汗订立不平等条约。到一九一九年，英国发动了第三次侵阿战争。这一次，阿富汗反抗英国侵略的斗争得到了新生的苏维埃国家的支持，同时英国干涉军在苏维埃国家遭到失败，因此英国不得不结束这场战争，承认阿富汗独立。
    阿富汗是君主立宪国家。现在的国王是穆罕穆德·扎希尔。根据阿富汗的宪法，立法权属于由国王、参议院及国民议会所组成的国会。参议院有由国王任命的任期终身的议员二十五名；国民议会规定有议员一百七十二名，由选举产生。
    阿富汗的自然资源是丰富的。地下蕴藏有金、银、石油、煤、铜、铁、锡、铅、石棉、锌、铬等大量的矿产。阿富汗还蕴藏有巨大的水力资源。
    阿富汗的经济基础主要是农业和牧畜业。农产品以谷物、棉花和油料作物为大宗。阿富汗的牧畜业在国家经济中占第二位。牧民约占全国人口三分之一。畜产品占总输出的百分之八十。
    一九一九年阿富汗独立后，在国内采取了一些社会改革措施，废除了内部关税，剥夺了贵族的国税征收权，收回了教会组织的土地。但目前全国土地的近百分之八十仍集中在贵族、地主和商人手里。
    阿富汗的经济和民族工业刚开始有一些发展，就遭到外国垄断资本的打击。现在阿富汗全国共有纺织、轧棉、毛织、火柴、皮鞋、制糖、水果罐头等工厂七十多家，城市工人十五万多人。工业品的需要大部分依靠进口。
    阿富汗各民族很早就创造了光辉的文化艺术。独立以后，阿富汗逐渐发展了近代教育。一九三二年创办的喀布尔大学，包括医学、文学、数学、理学、法律等六个部分，它是阿富汗的主要文化中心，现有学生七百五十人。
    阿富汗政府执行着独立和平的外交政策。这个政策是以同其他国家建立善邻关系为基础。一九五四年四月，阿富汗副首相兼外交大臣纳伊姆汗表示，阿富汗支持和平共处的五项原则。阿富汗曾一再表示反对美巴军事同盟和巴格达条约。阿富汗和其他国家一起，积极参加了有二十九个国家参加的亚非会议。阿富汗外交大臣在今年五月初参加亚非会议返国途中曾着重指出，阿富汗“希望同亚非各国所有爱好和平的人民和其他国家的人民有良好的关系”，主张加强亚非各国之间经济和文化上的联系。在联合国会议上，阿富汗积极支持许多有利于维护和平和反对殖民主义的建议。
    中国人民和阿富汗人民有着悠久的历史友谊。从汉代以来，我国人民就和阿富汗各民族不断接触，互相交流经济文化。中华人民共和国成立后，阿富汗外长在一九五○年一月致电我国，承认中华人民共和国为合法政府。一九五五年一月中阿两国正式建立了正常的外交关系。
    阿富汗和它的邻邦苏联，一向有着密切的友谊。一九一九年五月，苏联政府在阿富汗宣布独立后不久，便承认了阿富汗的完全独立。一九二一年二月，苏阿两国缔结了一项友好条约，并建立了外交和通商关系。一九二六年两国又签订了互不侵犯条约。这个条约巩固了阿富汗和苏联的友好关系。一九四六年六月苏阿缔结新国界协定，根据新国界协定，苏阿国境线不再像一八七三年协定所规定的那样沿阿姆河左岸划分，而是沿河的中心线划分，这样就使阿富汗政府有权利用阿姆河沿岸一千二百五十公里的地方作航行和灌溉之用。喀布尔报纸评论这个协定说：“这是苏联对我们亲爱的国家善意的最好证明，我们完全支持这个协定，并衷心地感谢苏联政府。”
    苏阿两国有着密切的经济关系，在第二次世界大战以前，苏联就为阿富汗工农业经济的发展提供了很大的援助。一九二九年到一九三三年发生世界经济恐慌时期，世界市场价格猛跌，苏联根据双方互利原则对阿富汗的出口给予了公正的价格，使阿富汗免于遭受世界经济危机的灾难性的影响。在一九三六年、一九四○年及一九五○年两国先后订立了多次贸易协定。苏联同阿富汗的贸易额近年来不断增加。在阿富汗发展近代经济的努力中，苏联提供了许多技术上和财政上的帮助，在苏联专家的帮助下，阿富汗在康都士城建立了全国最大的清棉工厂。苏联还在帮助阿富汗建设两个设有机器装备的谷仓，一个面粉厂，和一个机器面包厂。这些工厂使阿富汗有可能改善对居民的面包供应，并建立起国内的谷物设备。为了减轻偿付这些机器装备的困难，苏联无私地对阿富汗提供了三百五十万美元的低利贷款。一九五四年十月，苏阿两国签订协定，由苏联贷款二百一十万美元给阿富汗铺筑喀布尔市街。同年十一月，双方又签订了一项贸易议定书，根据这项议定书，苏联将供给阿富汗石油产品、五金、糖、棉织品、汽车机器和其他物品，苏联将从阿富汗输入羊毛、棉花、皮革、干果、油料作物种子等。今年以来，两国先后签订了关于交换邮包协定及关于双方一切货物自由运输条约。阿富汗报纸指出：这些协定既有助于促进阿苏之间的亲密友谊，又能促进阿富汗经济的发展。在苏联技术援助下建设的阿富汗柏油和混凝土混合工厂，已在今年五月开始生产。
    苏联和阿富汗之间的文化交流也有发展。一九五三年底，阿富汗代表团访问了苏联。一九五四年十二月，以苏联科学院院士弗·弗·塔利津为首的苏联文化工作者代表团到阿富汗作友好访问。
    苏联和阿富汗两国之间的这种经济和文化关系的增进，完全是建立在平等互利、友好合作基础上。它们对增进苏阿两国人民的传统友谊，促进国际和平合作都有重大的意义。现在，苏联领袖布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫到阿富汗进行友好访问，它将大大推进苏联和阿富汗的友谊关系，并有助于亚洲和世界的和平事业。
