    Emphasize Publicity for Trial Production and Manufacturing of New Products
    Liu Kai
    Trial production and manufacturing of new products is an important task in realizing China's First Five-Year Plan, and also an urgent task for industrial enterprises at present. Doing this work well can not only increase industrial production and meet the growing needs of national construction and people's lives, but also improve China's industrial technical level and manufacturing capabilities, creating conditions for the smooth completion of the country's socialist industrialization. Therefore, newspapers have a responsibility to reflect and promote the trial production and production of new products, and to regard it as an important part of the newspaper's economic publicity.
    The large-scale trial production and manufacturing of new products in various industrial sectors has only been brought to our attention since the national economy entered a period of planned construction. This is still a new issue for the majority of enterprise staff and workers. Therefore, newspapers should always pay attention to publicizing the relationship between trial production and manufacturing of new products and national construction and people's lives, explaining its significance for completing and overfulfilling the Five-Year Plan and realizing the country's socialist industrialization, so that everyone can understand the importance of this work and strive to do it well. At present, many newspapers have paid attention to this issue. However, judging from the general reporting situation, they often only mention the importance of trial production and manufacturing of new products in general terms, or when reporting the successful trial production of a certain new product, say that it "strongly supports the country's important construction," "meets the needs of people's lives," etc.; and fail to fully and concretely reveal its role and significance through the influence and changes brought about by the new product in actual production, construction and people's lives, so as to improve people's understanding of this work. The Shenyang Daily has learned such a lesson. According to the newspaper's self-examination, they once reported the news that the Shenyang Chemical Plant had started producing synthetic hydrochloric acid. But in this news, people could not see what synthetic hydrochloric acid was used for, and what the significance of producing it was. The "automatic block interlocking machine" successfully trial-produced by the Shenyang Railway Signal Factory is a major technological transformation for the railway transportation department, but the Shenyang Daily did not prominently report its significance and role. In this way, it cannot achieve the purpose of inspiring people and mobilizing the masses.
    It is very difficult for various industrial departments to produce products that have never been manufactured before. This is especially true in factories and mines with low technical levels and backward equipment, and a lack of experience in trial production of new products. Therefore, in order to boost everyone's confidence and give them practical help, newspapers should always pay attention to discovering successful cases and work experience in the trial production of new products, and publicize and promote them. The Shanghai Liberation Daily once set up a column called "New Products of Shanghai," which published a photo and a short article each time to introduce a new product in a popular and vivid way. The Beijing Daily has recently concentrated and prominently publicized new products in the two columns "Produce More New Products to Support National Construction" and "Produce More New Products to Meet People's Needs" according to the nature and use of the new products. These are all methods that can be adopted. The Liaoning Daily once published a newsletter entitled "Manufacture More New Products to Support National Construction," which stated that in the past, almost no machinery factory in Dalian could independently produce a single product, but after continuous development since liberation, it can now produce such large or precision products as 600-ton iron mixing furnaces, quenching furnaces, coke pushing machines, and universal machine tools. The newspaper also specifically described the quenching furnace trial-produced by the Dalian Lifting Machinery Factory, which is as tall as a ten-story building, and the error cannot exceed twenty centimeters, and every steel plate used must be chemically analyzed. Using this method of comparing the past and the present can also inspire people. In some news and newsletters, the Liaoning Daily, on the one hand, reported the achievements in the trial production and production of new products, and on the other hand, also reflected the various difficulties encountered in the trial production work, and specifically reported the spirit of the workers in overcoming various difficulties. This not only truthfully reflects the actual work situation, but also makes this publicity more encouraging.
    In the publicity of trial production and manufacturing of new products, like in other publicity, in addition to vigorously supporting advanced things, various erroneous ideas and behaviors that hinder the trial production and production of new products should also be actively criticized and struggled against. In the second quarter of this year, the Liaoning Daily criticized some enterprise leaders who did not pay attention to leading the trial production and production of new products. The Liaoning Daily adopted a specific analysis method when conducting criticism. For example, due to the different situations of each factory, the ideological problems that existed were also different. Some factories produced pride because of past achievements in the trial production of new products, and did not actively lead the trial production of new products; some emphasized the low technical level, poor quality of cadres, and the complexity of the task of trial production of new products, and therefore had negative thoughts about the trial production of new products; and some factories opposed the task of trial production of new products to the regular production tasks, and simply emphasized the completion of production tasks, ignoring the leadership of the work of trial production of new products, etc. The newspaper criticized these erroneous ideas. This played a positive role in promoting the correct attitude of each factory towards the work of trial production and production of new products, and urging some responsible staff to actively strengthen the leadership of this work.
    In the publicity of trial production and manufacturing of new products, in addition to the above-mentioned issues, overcoming the shortcomings of simplicity, dryness, and formulaic writing in the reports is also a problem worth noting. Just as some newspapers said in their publicity summaries, they often wrote the news of trial production and manufacturing of new products like product advertisements, with only specifications, simple uses, etc.; and often limited the content of publicity for trial production and manufacturing of new products to publishing a few news of successful trial production of new products. This cannot achieve a good publicity effect. In order to correct these shortcomings, the Liaoning Daily made some efforts between April and July of this year. During this period, the newspaper not only had news reports of successful trial production of new products and comments and short articles discussing the work of trial production of new products, but also had newsletters describing the enthusiasm and creativity of workers "New People in the Manufacturing of New Products", "No Matter How Difficult, We Must Successfully Trial Produce New Products", and sketches reflecting the happy mood of the workers when they saw the new products they manufactured were about to leave the factory "The First Large Electric Shovel" and articles reflecting the struggle between new and old ideas in the trial production of new products "A Debate in the Face of New Technology". This proves that as long as we work hard, even for publicity reports such as the trial production and manufacturing of new products, which involve many technical issues, it is possible to achieve diverse themes, rich content, and vivid writing.

### 重视试制和制造新产品的宣传

    重视试制和制造新产品的宣传
    刘凯
    试制和制造新产品，是实现我国第一个五年计划的一个重要任务，也是目前工业企业中的一项迫切工作。做好这一工作，不但可以增加工业生产，满足国家建设和人民生活日益增长的需要；而且还会提高我国工业的技术水平和制造能力，为顺利完成国家的社会主义工业化创造条件。因此，报纸就有责任反映和推动新产品的试制和生产工作，并且把它作为报纸经济宣传的重要内容之一。
    大量地在各个工业部门试制和制造新产品，是国民经济进入有计划的建设时期以后，才提到我们面前来的。这对于大多数的企业工作人员和工人群众，还是一个新的问题。所以，报纸应该经常注意宣传试制和制造新产品同国家建设和人民生活的关系，说明它对于完成和超额完成五年计划和实现国家的社会主义工业化的重大意义，让每个人都能了解这一工作的重要性，并且努力去做好它。目前，许多报纸已经注意了这个问题。但是从一般报道情况看来，往往还只是泛泛地提到试制和制造新产品的重要，或者在报道某种新产品试制成功的时候，说它“有力地支援了国家的重要建设”、“满足了人民生活的需要”等等；而不能通过新产品在实际生产建设和人民生活当中所引起的影响和变化，充分地具体地把它的作用和意义揭示出来，以提高人们对这一工作的认识。沈阳日报就有过这样的教训。据这个报纸检查，他们过去曾报道过沈阳化工厂开始生产合成盐酸的消息。可是在这条消息里，人家不能看出合成盐酸是作什么用的，生产它又有什么意义。沈阳铁路信号工厂试制成功的“自动闭塞联锁机”，是铁路运输部门的一项重大技术改造，沈阳日报也没有对它的意义和作用突出地加以报道。这样也就不能达到鼓舞人心和动员群众的目的。
    各个工业部门要把过去从来没有制造过的产品生产出来，困难是很多的。特别在技术水平低和设备落后的厂矿，试制新产品的经验又很缺乏，就更是如此。因此，为了鼓舞大家的信心并给他们以实际的帮助，报纸就要经常注意发现试制新产品中的成功事例和工作经验，加以宣传和推广。上海解放日报曾经设立“上海的新产品”专栏，每次刊出一张照片和短小的文章，通俗生动地介绍一种新产品。北京日报近来在“多生产新产品，支援国家建设”、“多生产新产品，满足人民需要”两个专栏内，按照新产品的性质和用途，分别加以集中突出地宣传。这都是可以采取的方法。辽宁日报曾发表过一篇“制造更多的新产品支援国家建设”的通讯，说明旅大市过去几乎没有一家机械工厂能独立生产一种产品，而解放后经过不断发展，到今天已能生产像六百吨混铁炉、淬火炉、推焦机和万能机床这样庞大或精密的产品。报纸并具体描述了大连起重机器厂试制的淬火炉，相当于十层楼房那么高，而误差不能超过二十糎，它所用的每一块钢板都必须经过化学分析等。运用这种今昔对比的方法，也能够鼓舞人心。辽宁日报在一些消息和通讯中，一方面报道了试制和生产新产品的成就，另一方面还反映了试制工作中遇到的种种困难，具体地报道了工人们克服各种困难的精神。这就不但真实地反映了实际工作的面貌，也使这一宣传更带有鼓舞性。
    报纸在试制和制造新产品的宣传当中，像在其他的宣传中一样，除了对先进事物要大力加以支持外，对于阻碍试制和生产新产品的各种错误思想和行为，也应积极地展开批评和斗争。辽宁日报在今年第二季度里，曾对一些不重视领导新产品试制和生产的企业领导人员进行了批评。辽宁日报进行批评时，采取了具体分析的方法。例如，由于各个工厂的情况不同，存在的思想问题也不同。有的工厂是由于过去在试制新产品中获得了成就，产生了骄傲情绪，不去积极地领导新产品试制工作；有的是强调技术水平低、干部质量差、试制新产品任务复杂，因而对试制新产品有消极思想；也还有一些工厂是把新产品试制任务和经常的生产任务对立起来，单纯强调完成生产任务，忽视对试制新产品工作的领导等。报纸就针对这些错误思想，进行了批评。这对于促进各工厂以正确的态度对待新产品试制和生产的工作，督促一些负责工作人员积极加强对这一工作的领导，都起了积极的作用。
    在试制和生产新产品的宣传中，除了上述的一些问题以外，克服报道中的简单、枯燥和公式化的缺点，也是一个值得注意的问题。正像有的报纸在宣传总结中所说的，他们过去常常把试制和生产新产品的消息，写得像商品广告那样，只是规格、简单的用途等等；也常常把试制和生产新产品的宣传的内容，只限于发表几条试制新产品获得成功的消息。这就不能起到很好的宣传效果。为了纠正这方面的缺点，辽宁日报在今年四月到七月间，曾经作过一些努力。在这期间，报纸上不但有报道新产品试制成功的消息和论述新产品试制工作的评论和短文，也有描述工人积极性和创造性的通讯“新产品制造中的新人物”、“再困难，也要把新产品试制成功”，有描写工人群众看到自己制造出来的新产品就要出厂时的愉快心情的速写“第一台大电铲”和反映试制新产品中新旧思想斗争的文章“在新技术面前的一场争论”。这就证明，只要我们努力去做，就是对于像试制和制造新产品这种牵涉到许多技术问题的宣传报道，也是可以做到题材多样、内容丰富和文字生动的。
