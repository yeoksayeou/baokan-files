Xinhua News Agency, December 9th – The first National Vegetable Work Conference, jointly convened in Beijing on November 28th by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Agriculture, concluded today. The conference was attended by 125 representatives from 42 cities and industrial and mining areas, as well as 23 provinces. It is the first time in Chinese history that such a national conference has been held to address the issue of vegetable consumption for residents of large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas.

The conference believes that the vegetable issue concerns the daily lives of 40 to 50 million residents in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas nationwide. According to estimates by the commercial sector, expenditures on non-staple foods account for about 25% of people's purchasing power. Furthermore, according to typical surveys in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, expenditures on vegetables by collective mess halls and residents account for over 20% of non-staple food expenditures.

The task of the conference was to arrange vegetable production, supply, and sales, and to plan for the cooperativization of vegetable production in urban and industrial and mining suburbs and the socialist transformation of urban vegetable merchants. The conference believes that accelerating the cooperativization of vegetable production and increasing vegetable yields in a planned way is the material foundation for guaranteeing vegetable supply. In order to stabilize vegetable prices and safeguard the interests of consumers and peasant producers, it is necessary to accelerate the socialist transformation of vegetable merchants. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen leadership and management of the peasant vegetable trade markets.

Currently, the quantity of vegetables produced by state-owned vegetable farms and agricultural production cooperatives in urban and industrial and mining suburbs is still very small, the leading force of socialist commerce in the vegetable market is still very weak, and the vegetable production of individual peasants is greatly influenced by market prices and is therefore largely blind. According to statistics from 30 large and medium-sized cities, in 56% of these cities, socialist commerce basically controls wholesale, while retail is still largely in the hands of private merchants; in 36% of the cities, private merchants dominate both wholesale and retail. Therefore, the vegetable market in some cities sometimes experiences a situation of supply falling short of demand and unstable prices. This not only increases the burden on the lives of workers and staff but is also detrimental to production. In addition, there is a contradiction between the seasonality of production and the constant nature of consumption in the vegetable issue. The conference believes that resolving this contradiction requires comprehensive arrangements, strengthening seasonal adjustment work, and organizing reserves by producers, consumers, and trade departments.

Based on the current problems in vegetable supply, the conference stipulated the working principles regarding the cooperativization of vegetable production and the socialist transformation of vegetable merchants. Based on these principles, representatives from various regions made preliminary plans for the cooperativization of vegetable production and the transformation of vegetable merchants. Finally, the conference also exchanged experiences in combining production and sales in vegetable management, organizing mass reserves, and managing vegetable markets, and arranged for the production and sales of famous vegetables such as Jiaozhou Chinese cabbage in Shandong, Luozhou radishes in Hubei, and Sichuan pickled mustard tuber.

### 全国第一次蔬菜工作会议在北京举行

    全国第一次蔬菜工作会议在北京举行
    据新华社九日讯　中华全国供销合作总社、商业部和农业部十一月二十八日在北京联合召开的全国第一次蔬菜工作会议，九日已经结束。出席会议的有四十二个城市和工矿区以及二十三个省的一百二十五位代表。召开这样全国性的会议来解决大、中城市和工矿区居民的吃菜问题，在中国历史上还是第一次。
    会议认为蔬菜问题是涉及全国大、中城市和工矿区四、五千万居民日常生活的问题。据商业部门的估算，购买副食品的支出在人民购买力中所占的比重，约在百分之二十五左右；另据北京、上海、武汉的典型调查，集体伙食单位和居民用于购买蔬菜的支出又占副食品支出的百分之二十多。
    会议的任务是安排蔬菜的生产、供应和销售，并且规划城市工矿郊区蔬菜生产的合作化和城市菜商的社会主义改造工作。会议认为，加速蔬菜生产的合作化，有计划地提高蔬菜的产量，是保证蔬菜供应的物质基础。为了稳定蔬菜价格，为了维护消费者的利益和农民生产者的利益，必须加速对菜商的社会主义改造工作。同时，还要加强对农民蔬菜贸易市场的领导和管理。
    目前，城市工矿郊区国营蔬菜农场和农业生产合作社所产蔬菜的数量还很少，社会主义商业在蔬菜市场上的领导力量还很薄弱，个体农民的蔬菜生产因为受市场价格影响带有很大的盲目性。根据三十个大、中城市的统计，在这些城市中，社会主义商业基本控制了蔬菜批发而零售仍大部分操在私商手中的城市占百分之五十六，批发和零售方面私商都占优势的城市占百分之三十六。因此，有些城市的蔬菜市场有时就出现了供不应求和价格不稳的情况。这不但加重了职工生活的负担，也很不利于生产。此外，蔬菜问题上还存在着生产的季节性和消费的经常性之间的矛盾。会议认为，解决这方面的矛盾就需要全面安排，加强季节性的调剂工作，并且组织生产者、消费者和贸易部门的储备。
    会议根据目前蔬菜供应中的问题，规定了关于蔬菜生产合作化和菜商的社会主义改造的工作原则。各地代表根据这些原则，对蔬菜生产合作化和菜商的改造作出了初步的规划。会议最后还交流了蔬菜经营上产销结合、组织群众性储备以及管理蔬菜市场方面的经验，安排了山东胶州大白菜、湖北萝?洲的大萝?、四川榨菜等著名蔬菜的产销问题。
