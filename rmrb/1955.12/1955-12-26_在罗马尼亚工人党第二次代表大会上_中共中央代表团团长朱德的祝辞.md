Dear Comrades! Entrusted by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Party, I extend the warmest congratulations on behalf of all members of the Chinese Communist Party and all the Chinese people to the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party, to the leading comrades of the Romanian Workers' Party, and to all the delegates present. (Stormy applause, the delegates cheered: "Mao Zedong")

The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people deeply admire the great achievements made by the fraternal Romanian people in socialist construction under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. (Applause) We are also extremely pleased to see that, thanks to the successful completion of Romania's first five-year plan for the development of the national economy and the brilliant achievements in implementing Romania's ten-year electrification plan, Romania's solid socialist economic foundation has been laid; at the same time, economically backward Romania no longer exists, and what has emerged is an increasingly prosperous and strong industrial-agricultural country of Romania with a constantly developing advanced industry. In a very short period of time, the People's Republic of Romania has established a powerful machine industry capable of producing sufficient petroleum industrial equipment, other industrial equipment, and various means of transportation, established a national agricultural machinery industry, established a powerful electric power industry and chemical industry, and rapidly developed Romania's major industries, such as the petroleum industry and the coal mining industry. Romania's constantly developing light industry provides residents with an increasing supply of various consumer goods. While socialist industry is constantly growing, Romania's agriculture, which is gradually transitioning to collectivization, is also developing. Based on the rapid development of social production, the material and cultural living standards of the Romanian people have been significantly improved. The course of events in Romania has once again demonstrated how great the creativity of the people who control the destiny of their own country is, and how enormous the superiority of socialism and the people's democratic system is.

This congress is faced with the great task of formulating and implementing the second five-year plan for Romania's national economic development and further developing Romania's agriculture on the basis of gradually realizing agricultural cooperation. The successful completion of these tasks will guarantee the comprehensive victory of Romania's socialist construction and the further great upsurge of Romania's national economy, thereby greatly increasing the welfare of the Romanian people and greatly strengthening the forces of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union. (Applause)

Because of the growing enthusiasm of the Romanian working class and the broad masses of working people in building socialism, because of the increasingly consolidated alliance between the Romanian working class and peasants, because the Romanian people have the strong Marxist-Leninist leadership of their own workers' party, because of the great example and great assistance of the Soviet Union in building socialism, and the assistance and support of the people's democratic countries and the proletariat of all countries, we are convinced that the task of building a completely socialist society in Romania will surely be successfully realized. (Applause)

Dear Comrades! Although China is far from Romania, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people are very happy to pay attention to the significant achievements of your cause, because your cause, like our own, is a part of the great cause of the entire socialist camp. (Applause) Your cause of socialist industrialization is ahead of us, which gives us great encouragement. The Chinese Communist Party has always believed that learning from the experience of the great Soviet Communist Party, the communist parties and workers' parties of the people's democratic countries can help the development of our country's socialist cause and contribute to our common struggle to defend international peace and develop the cause of human progress. (Applause)

I am very pleased to report to the comrades: The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people are also advancing bravely towards the great goal of building a socialist society. (Long and thunderous applause) It is certainly very difficult to build a socialist society in an eastern country with a population of 600 million and a very backward industrial development, but our party believes that these difficulties can certainly be overcome. (Applause) The existence of the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and the assistance and demonstration role given to us by the Soviet Union and the fraternal countries, are the most favorable international conditions for us to build socialism. (Applause)

Our country is now rapidly carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce. Since the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held in October this year, the tide of agricultural cooperation has risen unprecedentedly. It is estimated that by the end of 1956, more than 70 to 80 percent of farmers across the country will have joined agricultural production cooperatives. (Applause) By 1957, 90 percent of the major industries of all capitalist industry and commerce across the country will have realized joint state-private ownership across the entire industry. (Applause) The Chinese Communist Party plans to basically build our country into a socialist industrial country around 1967. (Applause) The progress of actual work now proves that this plan can be realized ahead of schedule.

Thanks to the active efforts of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the people of all countries to strive for peace, the recent international tensions have eased to a certain extent, and it is also possible to strive for further easing. This is beneficial to the peaceful construction of our socialist camp countries. But on the other hand, we cannot but vigilantly note that international aggressive forces are doing everything possible to obstruct the easing of the international situation and continue to pursue a policy of preparing for a new world war.

In the interests of our common socialist and peace cause, it is of paramount importance to further strengthen the internationalist unity of the working people, especially to further strengthen the close cooperation of the socialist camp countries, and on this basis, to further strengthen our cooperation with all peace-loving countries and people in the world. (Applause) The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people will work together with the Soviet Union, Romania, the people's democratic countries, and other fraternal parties to consolidate and develop the unity and cooperation between the people of all countries, and to defend and develop the cause of human progress.

Dear Comrades! Eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship and cooperation have been established between the Chinese people and the Romanian people who have mastered their own destiny, and between the people of all countries in the entire socialist camp. This great friendship and cooperation is a reliable guarantee for world peace and the socialist cause.

The Chinese people attach great importance to the close friendship with the Romanian people. This brotherly friendship is being developed and deepened through the conclusion and implementation of agreements on cultural cooperation, scientific and technological cooperation, and economic cooperation between the two countries, through the increasingly frequent mutual visits between the people of the two countries, and the increasingly frequent contacts between the two fraternal parties and the exchange of experience in socialist construction. The visit of Comrade G. Apostol and Dr. Petru Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian National Assembly, to our country in September and October 1954, has a particularly important significance for the development of the friendship between our two peoples. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, to express my heartfelt thanks for the kind care, support, and assistance given by the Romanian Workers' Party, the government of the People's Republic of Romania, and the Romanian people. (Applause)

We feel very happy to have the opportunity to participate in this historically significant Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party, and to learn many things from this congress. (Applause)

I wish the congress complete success!

I wish the People's Republic of Romania greater prosperity and strength in its development towards the complete victory of socialism! (Applause)

Long live the fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the Chinese and Romanian peoples!
(Thunderous applause)

Long live the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union!
(Stormy applause. The delegates cheered: "Soviet Union")

Long live the strong detachment of the international communist movement, the Romanian Workers' Party! (Thunderous applause. The delegates cheered: "Mao Zedong," and shouted: "Hurrah!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Hurrah!" "Long live the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!" "Long live the unity of the people of the great socialist camp!"）

    在罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会上
    中共中央代表团团长朱德的祝辞
    亲爱的同志们！我受到中国共产党中央委员会和党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志的委托，谨代表中国共产党的全体党员和全体中国人民，向罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会，向罗马尼亚工人党的领导同志们和各位代表同志致最热烈的祝贺。（暴风雨般的掌声，代表们欢呼：“毛泽东”）
    中国共产党和中国人民深深地钦佩兄弟的罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党、在以乔治乌—德治同志为首的罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会的领导下在社会主义建设中所获得的伟大成就。（掌声）我们并且极愉快地看到，由于罗马尼亚发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的胜利完成，和执行罗马尼亚十年电气化计划的辉煌成就，罗马尼亚的牢固的社会主义经济基础已经奠定；同时，经济上落后的罗马尼亚已经不存在了，现在出现的是日益繁荣和强盛的、拥有不断发展着的先进工业的工业—农业国的罗马尼亚。罗马尼亚人民共和国在很短的时间内，已经建立了能够生产充足的石油工业装备、其他工业装备和各种运输工具的强大的机械工业，建立了国家的农业机械工业，建立了强大的电力工业和化学工业，并且使罗马尼亚的主要工业——石油工业和采煤工业等等极迅速地发展起来。不断发展着的罗马尼亚的轻工业为居民提供着日益充足的各种消费品。在社会主义工业不断增长的同时，逐步地向集体化过渡的罗马尼亚的农业也在向前发展。在社会生产迅速发展的基础上，罗马尼亚人民的物质生活和文化生活水平获得了显著的提高。在罗马尼亚的事变发展进程，又一次地证明了掌握了自己国家的命运的人民具有多么伟大的创造力，证明了社会主义和人民民主制度具有多么巨大的优越性。
    这次大会面临着拟定和实施罗马尼亚发展国民经济的第二个五年计划，并且在逐步实现农业合作化的基础上进一步地发展罗马尼亚农业的伟大任务。这些任务的胜利完成，将保证罗马尼亚社会主义建设事业的全面胜利和罗马尼亚国民经济进一步的巨大高涨，从而将大为增进罗马尼亚人民的福利，并且将大为增强以苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的力量。（掌声）
    由于罗马尼亚工人阶级和广大劳动群众建设社会主义的热情日益高涨，由于罗马尼亚工人阶级和农民的联盟日益巩固，由于罗马尼亚人民有着自己的工人党的坚强的马克思列宁主义的领导，由于有着苏联建设社会主义的伟大榜样和伟大援助，以及各人民民主国家和各国无产阶级的援助和支持，我们深信，在罗马尼亚建成完全的社会主义社会的任务，必然能够顺利地实现。（掌声）
    亲爱的同志们！虽然中国离罗马尼亚很远，中国工人阶级和中国人民都非常高兴地注意着你们的事业的重大的成就，因为你们的事业和我们自己的事业一样，都是整个社会主义阵营的伟大事业的一个部分。（掌声）你们的社会主义工业化的事业走在我们的前面，这给我们很大的鼓舞。中国共产党始终认为向伟大的苏联共产党、向各人民民主国家的共产党和工人党学习经验，就能帮助我国的社会主义事业的发展，并且有助于我们共同的保卫国际和平和发展人类的进步事业的斗争。（掌声）
    我很高兴地向同志们报告：中国共产党和中国人民也正在向着建成社会主义社会的伟大目标奋勇前进。（经久不息的掌声）我们要在具有六亿人口的、工业发展很落后的一个东方国家建成社会主义社会，当然是有巨大困难的，但是我们党相信，这些困难是一定可以克服的。（掌声）伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家的存在，苏联和各兄弟国家给我们的援助和示范作用，就是我们建设社会主义的最有利的国际条件。（掌声）
    我国现在正在迅速地进行着对于农业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。在今年十月间举行的中国共产党中央全体会议以后，农业合作化的潮流空前地高涨起来了，预计在一九五六年年底以前，全国加入农业生产合作社的农民就将达到百分之七、八十以上。（掌声）到一九五七年，全国一切资本主义工商业的重要行业，就将有百分之九十实现全行业的公私合营。（掌声）中国共产党的计划是在大约一九六七年把我国基本上建成为社会主义的工业国家。（掌声）现在实际工作的进展证明，这个计划是可以提前实现的。
    由于苏联、各人民民主国家和各国人民争取和平的积极努力，最近时期国际紧张局势已经有了一定程度的和缓，并且还有可能争取进一步的和缓。这对于我们社会主义阵营各国的和平建设事业是有利的。但是另一方面，我们还不能不警惕地注意到，国际侵略势力正在千方百计地阻挠国际局势的缓和，并且继续执行准备新的世界战争的政策。
    为着我们共同的社会主义和和平事业的利益，进一步加强劳动人民的国际主义的团结，首先是进一步加强社会主义阵营各国的亲密合作，并且在这个基础上，进一步加强我们同世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人们的合作，具有无比的重要性。（掌声）中国共产党和中国人民将同苏联、罗马尼亚、各人民民主国家和其他国家的兄弟党一道，为巩固和发展各国人民之间的团结和合作而努力，为保卫和发展人类的进步事业而努力。
    亲爱的同志们！掌握了自己的命运的中国人民和罗马尼亚人民之间，以及整个社会主义阵营各国人民之间，已经建立了永恒的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊和合作，这种伟大的友谊和合作，就是世界和平和社会主义事业的可靠保证。
    中国人民极为重视同罗马尼亚人民的亲密的友谊。这种兄弟一般的友谊，通过两国之间有关文化合作、科学技术合作、经济合作的协定的订立和执行，通过两国人民之间日益频繁的互相访问，以及两国兄弟党之间的日益频繁的接触和彼此交换社会主义建设的经验，正在日益发展和密切。格·阿波斯托尔同志和罗马尼亚国民议会主席团主席彼·格罗查博士一九五四年九、十月间的访问我国，对于我们两国人民间的友谊的发展有特别重要的意义。请让我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，对于罗马尼亚工人党、罗马尼亚人民共和国政府和罗马尼亚人民所给予的亲切的关怀、支持和帮助，表示衷心的感谢。（掌声）
    我们觉得非常高兴，能够有机会参加这次具有重大历史意义的罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会，并且从这次大会学习许多东西。（掌声）
    祝大会完满成功！
    祝罗马尼亚人民共和国在向社会主义完全胜利的发展中更加繁荣和强盛！（掌声）
    中罗两国人民间的兄弟友谊和亲密合作万岁！
  （雷动般的掌声）
    以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营万岁！
  （暴风雨般的掌声。代表们欢呼：“苏联”）
    国际共产主义运动的坚强支队罗马尼亚工人党万岁！（雷动的掌声。代表们欢呼：“毛泽东”，高呼：“乌拉！”“中国共产党万岁！”“乌拉！”“以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会万岁！”“伟大的社会主义阵营各国人民的团结万岁！”）
