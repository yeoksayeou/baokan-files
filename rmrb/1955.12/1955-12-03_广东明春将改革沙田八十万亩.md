    Guangdong Province's Pearl River Delta sandy field area, based on cooperativization, will convert 800,000 mu of paddy fields from double-cropping interplanting to double-cropping continuous planting next spring. It is estimated that the implementation of this technological reform will increase national grain production by at least 120 million to 160 million jin next year.
    Currently, agricultural production cooperatives in the sandy field area are carrying out unified planning, and basic construction work such as water conservancy construction and soil improvement can begin after the autumn harvest. The Guangdong Provincial Sandy Field Work Committee is also working on various preparations for this reform; relevant departments will strengthen the supply of draft cattle, mud boats, and chemical fertilizers to the sandy field area. The National Bank will issue loans of 2,389,000 yuan to farmers in the sandy field areas of Zhongshan, Xinhui, Zhuhai, Panyu and other seven counties.
    The Pearl River Delta has about 3 million mu of sandy fields, with fertile soil, but in the past, due to insufficient manpower, lack of draft cattle and large agricultural implements, farmers generally adopted the double-cropping interplanting method, and the potential of the land was not fully exploited. With the development of the cooperative movement, coupled with strong assistance from the state in various aspects, the area of double-cropping interplanting converted to double-cropping continuous planting has increased year by year. In the spring of 1954, more than 140,000 mu of paddy fields implemented double-cropping continuous planting; this spring, the area of paddy fields implementing double-cropping continuous planting increased to more than 725,000 mu.

    广东明春将改革沙田八十万亩
    广东省珠江三角洲沙田区在合作化基础上，明年春耕将有八十万亩水稻由双季间作改为双季连作。实行这一技术改革，估计明年至少可为国家增产粮食一亿二千万斤至一亿六千万斤。
    目前，沙田区各个农业生产合作社正在进行统一规划，秋收后即可开始兴修水利和改良土壤等基本建设工作。广东省沙田工作委员会也着手为这一改革进行各项准备工作；各有关部门将对沙田区加强耕牛、泥艇和化学肥料等供应工作。国家银行将发放二百三十八万九千元贷款给中山、新会、珠海、番禺等七县沙田地区的农民。
    珠江三角洲约有沙田三百万亩，土质肥沃，但是过去农民由于人力不足，耕牛和大农具缺乏，一般都是采用双季间作法，土地潜力没有充分发挥。随着合作化运动的发展，加上国家从各方面给予大力援助，双季间作改为双季连作的面积逐年增加。一九五四年春，实行双季连作的稻田就有十四万多亩；今春，实行双季连作的稻田又增加到七十二万五千多亩。
