The Myth of American "Prosperity"
        Qin Benli

Defenders of all stripes of the capitalist system are heavily promoting the so-called "prosperity" of the United States in 1955, even claiming that the United States can "avoid" cyclical economic crises inherent to capitalism.

This bankrupt myth is, of course, utterly absurd. Since the end of World War II, the United States has already experienced two cyclical economic crises, namely those of 1948-1949 and 1953-1954.

The so-called "prosperity" of the United States in 1955 is just another new example.

Although there was some growth in U.S. industrial production in 1955 – or, more accurately, it just barely recovered from the crisis of 1953-1954, with the overall industrial production index increasing by only about 2 percent compared to 1953 – this growth was based on the militarization of the economy and inflation.

In the U.S. fiscal year 1954-1955, total expenditures were $64.5 billion, of which $40.4 billion was directly used for military expenditures, accounting for 62.8 percent of the total. It is not true that military spending is no longer an important factor in the U.S. economy, as U.S. bourgeois economists attempt to portray. This is the main factor supporting the "prosperity" of the U.S. economy.

Deliberately manipulating inflation and credit expansion is another important factor. According to U.S. press materials, more than half of the cars sold in the U.S. this year were sold on installment plans; 80-85 percent of houses are sold with buyers using mortgages. And automobile production and housing construction are the two major pillars supporting the "prosperity" of the U.S. economy.

This growth initially only extended to the automotive, steel, and housing construction industries. Later, it became slightly more widespread. But currently, increased production is mainly concentrated in these industries. Other important industrial sectors, especially daily necessities industries, including textiles, ready-to-wear clothing, leather, etc., have remained at lower levels of production, with almost no increase; while other not-insignificant industries, such as coal mining, are in a straight decline.

The problem is not only that this growth is not worth boasting about, but also that the unfavorable factors accompanying this growth are increasingly playing an important role. The result of large military expenditures for several years is an increase in national expenditures, taxes, and national debt.

The U.S. fiscal year 1954-1955 had a budget deficit of $4.2 billion, and the national debt increased to a new peak of $277 billion. The purchasing power of the dollar is currently less than 50 percent of what it was before World War II. Signs of inflation in the United States are already very significant.

The method of expanding credit to stimulate consumption has caused private debt to rise continuously. According to the most conservative estimates, the total debt of U.S. consumers has reached a record high of over $120 billion, with an average debt of over $625 per family.

This unprecedentedly large debt, for the American people, is mortgaging the future, destroying present and future purchasing power. The U.S. economic community believes that these "dangerous signs" of increased debt "contain the seeds of future depression." The U.S. government also feels the seriousness of this situation, having raised bank lending rates three times this year and taken measures such as restricting lending conditions. However, these measures will inevitably weaken the already fragile foundation of the so-called "prosperity."

Expanding demand through credit and installment plans can in no way free U.S. industry from overproduction, because this is not based on an increase in the actual purchasing power of the American people. This stopgap measure not only cannot get rid of the crisis, but instead deepens it.

The U.S. agricultural surplus crisis further developed in 1955.

Of course, this is not to say that U.S. agricultural products are absolutely surplus. Overproduction is the result of working people not having the money to buy what they need, and even absolutely reducing consumption. For example, in 1955, the average consumption of textiles per resident decreased by 9 percent compared to five years ago, and cotton consumption decreased by 13 percent. Therefore, although the U.S. government has forced farmers to reduce wheat planting area by 30 percent and cotton planting area by 28 percent over the past two years, the U.S. agricultural surplus crisis continues to develop. According to statistics, by the beginning of December, the value of surplus agricultural products accumulated in the U.S. Commodity Credit Corporation had reached $7.7 billion, an increase of more than $1 billion compared to the same period last year. The largest stockpiles are wheat and cotton.

The continued deterioration of the agricultural situation has become a serious threat to the U.S. economy.

Another aspect of the U.S. economic "prosperity" is the deepening of class division.

In 1955, a small handful of U.S. monopoly giants did indeed get significantly richer. Pre-tax profits in 1955 increased to an unprecedented record of $43 billion. The profits of the largest 451 monopoly enterprises increased by about 33 percent compared to last year. In particular, monopoly enterprises related to war production made the most profits. General Motors Corporation had more than $900 million in after-tax profits in the first nine months of this year. This company received the most military orders among all monopoly enterprises.

However, on the other hand, the broad masses of American workers are under the heavy burden of taxes and debt, the multiple oppression of inflation and unemployment, and are becoming increasingly impoverished.

According to statistics, in 1955, every American had to bear $537 in taxes and repay much more debt than in previous years.

Prices remained at a very high level. By mid-October this year, wholesale prices of industrial products had risen by another 4 percent compared to the beginning of the year, and retail prices had also risen accordingly. According to statistics published by the U.S. Department of Labor, the cost of living in October 1955 rose to 114.9 (with the average cost of living index for 1947-1949 being 100). Clothing, rent, medical expenses, personal expenses, telephone bills, fuel, and coal costs, which affect the lives of many families, have all increased.

Therefore, even in the best case, for example, the nominal wages of U.S. auto workers have risen by 4 percent annually in the past four years, but still cannot keep up with the rise in prices. For steelworkers with higher wage levels, according to materials from the Steelworkers Union, the wage income of 40 percent of steelworkers is still lower than the officially greatly reduced minimum cost of living.

At the same time, the increase in production has not led to a corresponding reduction in the number of unemployed. By July 1955, according to official U.S. figures, industrial production was roughly the same as in July 1953, but the number of workers in the manufacturing industry decreased by 4 percent, which is to say, a decrease of 800,000 people; in addition, the number of workers in the mining industry decreased by 12 percent, and transportation workers decreased by 7 percent.

As for U.S. farmers, due to the decline in the price of agricultural products and the rise in the price of industrial products, this year's net income decreased by 10 percent compared to a year ago. This has been the fourth consecutive year of decline since 1951. But these averages do not show the actual situation of the decline in income of U.S. middle, especially small farmers, and tenant farmers.

At the same time, the contradictions caused by the competition for markets between the United States and other capitalist countries have also intensified. In 1955, the general economic situation in other capitalist countries began to deteriorate, and serious problems have occurred in the trade balance and balance of payments of many countries. Therefore, they have successively reduced imports and strengthened exports. Reflected in the U.S. foreign trade, the export volume in the first half of 1955 was even lower than in the first half of 1954, and decreased by 5 percent compared to the first half of 1953. For the United States, a capitalist country that needs to export a large number of industrial products, the shrinking of foreign markets is not unrelated to the development of domestic commodity surpluses.

The U.S. economic situation in 1955 clearly shows that the temporary, distorted growth of production has nothing in common with genuine economic prosperity. On the contrary, within this growth, the factors of crisis are continuing to develop, and the measures taken to promote this growth are exacerbating the deepening of the basic contradictions leading to the economic crisis. It is this economic fragility that explains why U.S. monopoly capital is increasingly afraid of international consultations, afraid of the "Geneva spirit," and afraid of further relaxation of international tensions.

    美国“繁荣”的神话　
    钦本立
    形形色色的资本主义制度的辩护人正在大肆宣传一九五五年美国的“繁荣”，甚至说在美国能够“避免”资本主义周期性的经济危机。
    这种早已破产的神话当然是十分荒唐的。在第二次大战结束以来，在美国就已经发生过两次周期性的经济危机，即一九四八—一九四九年，一九五三—一九五四年的危机。
    所谓一九五五年美国的“繁荣”正是又一个新的例子。
    美国工业生产在一九五五年虽有某种增长——说得更确切些是刚刚从一九五三—一九五四年的危机中恢复过来，工业生产总指数比一九五三年不过增加百分之二左右——，这种增长也是建立在经济军事化和通货膨胀的基础之上的。
    美国一九五四—一九五五财政年度总支出为六四五亿美元，其中直接用于军费支出的就达四○四亿美元，占总支出的百分之六二·八。美国资产阶级经济学者企图把事情说成好像军费支出已不成为美国经济的一个重要因素是不符合事实的。这是支持美国经济“繁荣”的主要因素。
    有意地玩弄通货和信贷膨胀的办法，是另一个重要因素。根据美国报刊材料，今年美国出售的汽车一半以上是靠分期付款的办法赊出的；百分之八○—八五的房屋是靠购买者以抵押的办法卖出的。而汽车生产和房屋建筑是支持美国经济“繁荣”的两大支柱。
    这次增长最初仅限于汽车、钢铁和房屋建筑业。以后变得稍为广泛一些。但到目前主要增加生产的还只是这些工业。其他一些重要工业部门，特别是日用必需品工业，包括纺织、现成服装、皮革等的生产一直处于较低的水平，几乎没有什么增加；而另外一些并非不重要的工业如采煤工业是在直线下降。
    问题不仅在于这种增长不值得吹嘘，问题还在于随着这种增长而来的不利因素正在日益起着重要的作用。几年来军费大量支出的结果，国家的开支、税收、国债都在增加。
    美国一九五四—一九五五财政年度的预算赤字达四十二亿美元，国债增加到二、七七○亿美元的新高峰。美元的购买力目前还不到第二次大战前的百分之五○。美国通货膨胀的迹象已很显著。
    用扩大信贷以刺激消费的办法，使私人的债务不断上升。根据最保守的估计，美国消费者负债的总数达到创纪录的一、二○○亿美元以上，平均每个家庭要负债六二五美元以上。
    这笔空前巨大的债务，对于美国人民说来，就是典当了将来，破坏了现在和未来的购买力。美国经济界认为这种负债增加的“危险迹象”中“包含着未来萧条的种子”。美国政府也感到这种情况的严重性，在今年已连续三次提高了银行放款利率，并采取了限制放款条件等措施。然而，这些措施又必不可免地会削弱本来就是脆弱的所谓“繁荣”的基础。
    用信贷和分期付款等方法扩大需求，无论如何不能使美国工业摆脱生产过剩，因为这不是建立在美国人民实际购买力提高的基础上。这种饮鸩止渴的办法，不但不能摆脱危机，反而使危机加深。
    美国农产品过剩危机在一九五五年进一步发展。
    当然，这不是说美国农产品是绝对的过剩。生产过剩是劳动人民没有钱来购买他所需要的东西，甚至是绝对减少消费的结果。例如一九五五年每个居民的纺织品平均消费量比五年前减少了百分之九，棉花消费量减少了百分之一三。所以，尽管过去两年，美国政府强使农民缩减了小麦种植面积百分之三○，棉花种植面积百分之二八，但美国农产品过剩危机还在继续发展。据统计，到十二月初，积存在美国商品信贷公司的剩余农产品价值已达七七亿美元，比一年前同期增加了一○亿多美元。积压最多的是小麦、棉花。
    农业情况的继续恶化已成为美国经济的严重威胁。
    美国经济“繁荣”的又一面就是阶级分化的加深。
    在一九五五年，美国一小撮垄断巨头的确大大发福了。一九五五年纳税前的利润增加到了四三○亿美元的空前记录。其中最大的四五一家垄断企业的利润比去年增加了百分之三三左右。其中特别是和战争生产有关的垄断企业获利最多。通用汽车公司在今年头九个月中在纳税后的利润有九亿多美元。这家公司在所有垄断企业中获得了最多的军事订货。
    可是，另一方面，美国广大劳动群众却处在沉重的捐税和债务负担、通货膨胀和失业的多重压迫之下，正愈来愈贫困。
    据统计，一九五五年每个美国人要摊到五三七美元的捐税，并且要偿还比往年多得多的债务。
    物价维持在很高的水平。到今年十月中旬，工业品批发价格比年初又上升了百分之四，零售价格也随着上升。根据美国劳工部发表的统计，一九五五年十月份生活费用上升到一一四·九（以一九四七—一九四九年的生活指数平均为一○○）。影响广大家庭生活的衣着、房租、医药费用、个人费用、电话费、燃料、煤费都增加了。
    因而，即使在最好的情况下，譬如，美国汽车工人最近四年每年名义工资上升了百分之四，也还是赶不上物价的上涨。以工资水平较高的钢铁工人来说，据钢铁工会的材料，有百分之四○钢铁工人的工资收入就比官方大大缩小的最低生活费还低。
    同时，生产的增加并没有造成相应的失业人数的减少。到一九五五年七月，根据美国官方数字，工业生产量大体上与一九五三年七月相同，但制造工业的工人减少了百分之四，就是说，减少了八○万人；此外，采矿工业的工人减少了百分之一二，运输工人减少了百分之七。
    至于美国农民，由于出售农产品的价格下降，工业品价格上涨，今年的净收入比一年前减少了百分之一○。这已经是从一九五一年以来连续第四年的下降。但这些平均数还不能表明美国中等的特别是小的农场主以及佃农收入下降的实际情况。
    与此同时，美国和其他资本主义国家间因争夺市场而引起的矛盾也加剧起来。一九五五年资本主义其他国家一般经济情况都在开始恶化，许多国家的贸易平衡和国际收支方面都已发生了严重的问题。因而纷纷削减进口，并加强输出。反映在美国的对外贸易方面，就是一九五五年上半年的出口数量比一九五四年上半年还低，比一九五三年上半年减少了百分之五。对于美国这个大量工业产品需要向外输出的资本主义国家来说，国外市场的萎缩在国内商品过剩已在发展的同时发生，并不是毫无关系的。
    一九五五年美国的经济情况清楚地说明，生产的暂时的畸形的增长和真正的经济繁荣毫无共同之处。相反在这种增长之中，危机的因素正在继续发展，为了促进这种增长所采取的措施，正在加剧导向经济危机的基本矛盾加深。正是经济上的这种脆弱性，说明了为什么美国垄断资本愈来愈害怕国际协商，害怕“日内瓦精神”，害怕国际紧张局势进一步缓和的缘故。
