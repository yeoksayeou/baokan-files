    Workers Advocate Supporting Agricultural Cooperativization

    The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory held a meeting of employee representatives on November 29th, passing a proposal suggesting that relevant units organize a labor emulation campaign among national farm implement manufacturing plants to support agricultural cooperativization. They also passed a letter of challenge to the youth double-wheel double-share plow assembly team of the Hubei Farm Implement Factory and the Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory assembly workshop.

    Kang Yonghe, Chairman of the National Committee of the First Machinery Trade Union of China, and a representative of the First Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the People's Republic of China, accepted the proposal from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory employees at the meeting. In his speech, Kang Yonghe expressed the hope that employees would work hard, avoid complacency, humbly learn from the advanced experiences of brother factories, and ensure the supply of affordable and high-quality farm implements to farmers.

    At the meeting, Shi Juncai, a Beijing Municipal Industrial Labor Model and leader of the plowshare group in the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory's foundry workshop, and more than a dozen other workers spoke successively. They unanimously stated that they would strive to improve their skills, learn advanced experiences, increase production by 6,000 double-wheel double-share plows, and work hard to achieve the conditions of the proposal to support agricultural cooperativization.
