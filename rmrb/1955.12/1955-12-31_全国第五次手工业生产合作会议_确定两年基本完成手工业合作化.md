Xinhua News Agency, December 30th – The Fifth National Handicraft Production Cooperative Conference, jointly convened by the Central Handicraft Bureau and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation, concluded on the 28th.

The conference determined that the organizational task of basically completing the national handicraft cooperativization should be achieved during the First Five-Year Plan period. Attention should also be paid to developing production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature, and actively promoting the transition from lower-level cooperative organizations to advanced production cooperatives. In areas with a good foundation for cooperativization, and in industries closely related to agricultural production, people's lives, and national construction, such as metal products, wood processing, cotton textile, knitting, paper making, ceramics, and leather, the development speed of cooperativization should be accelerated. While developing cooperativization, corresponding technical transformation of handicrafts is also required, in order to gradually realize semi-mechanized and mechanized production, fundamentally changing the backward state of handicraft production.

After examining and criticizing the conservative and backward thinking in past work, the conference focused on studying the overall plan for the socialist transformation of handicrafts nationwide in the future. The conference required all regions to formulate comprehensive plans for the socialist transformation of handicrafts in the entire province (city), entire special zone (city), entire county (city), and entire region (centered on market towns); and to quickly establish and improve handicraft leading organizations at all levels, and to train a large number of key personnel for establishing cooperatives and professional cadres in accounting, planning, and statistics, change the past piecemeal method of establishing cooperatives, carry out the transformation of entire industries in stages, batches, and areas, actively develop, and actively transition. All handicraft production cooperatives (groups) must continuously improve technology, increase product varieties, improve product quality, reduce product costs, and vigorously expand agricultural tool repair and fitting services to meet the growing needs of urban and rural people in production and life.

The representatives attending the conference also discussed the "Model Articles of Association (Draft) of Grassroots Cooperatives of Arts and Crafts," the "Articles of Association (Draft) of the All-China Federation of Arts and Crafts Cooperatives," and the report on the explanation of the Model Articles of Association (Draft) of Grassroots Cooperatives of Arts and Crafts.

    确定两年基本完成手工业合作化
    新华社三十日讯　中央手工业管理局和中华全国手工业生产合作社联合总社筹备委员会联合召开的全国第五次手工业生产合作会议在二十八日闭幕。
    会议确定，在第一个五年计划期间要基本上完成全国手工业合作化的组织任务，并且要注意发展完全社会主义性质的生产合作社，积极推动低级形式的合作组织向高级的生产合作社过渡。在合作化基础较好的地区以及同农业生产、人民生活、国家建设有密切关系的行业，如金属制品、木材加工、棉纺织、针织、造纸、陶瓷、皮革等行业，合作化的发展速度还应当加快。在合作化发展的同时，还要求相应地进行手工业的技术改造，以逐步实现半机械化、机械化生产，从根本上改变手工业生产的落后状态。
    会议检查和批判了过去工作中的保守落后思想后，着重研究了今后全国手工业社会主义改造的全面规划。会议要求各地订出全省（市）、全专区（市）、全县（市）和全区（以集镇为中心）手工业社会主义改造的全面规划；并且迅速建立和健全各级手工业领导机构，大量训练建社骨干和会计、计划、统计等专业干部，改变过去零打碎敲的建社方法，进行全行业分期、分批、分片的改造，积极发展，积极过渡。各手工业生产合作社（组）要不断地提高技术，增加产品品种，提高产品质量，降低产品成本，大力扩大农具修配业务，以适应城乡人民生产和生活上日益增长的需要。
    出席这次会议的代表还讨论了“工艺合作社基层社示范章程（草案）”、“中华全国工艺合作社联合总社章程（草案）”以及关于工艺合作社基层社示范章程（草案）说明的报告。
