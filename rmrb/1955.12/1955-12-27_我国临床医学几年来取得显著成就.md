The Medical Science Research Committee of the Ministry of Health recently summarized the progress of clinical medicine in China since liberation. In the past few years, all departments of clinical medicine in China have made significant achievements, which have played a significant guaranteeing role in the people's health care.

In terms of internal medicine, the accumulation of physiological normal values of Chinese people (blood cell count, blood type, serum enzymes, etc.) has begun. For heart disease, electrocardiogram examinations have been improved and widely used, and cardiac catheterization has begun to be applied, thereby improving the diagnosis of congenital heart disease, assisting in promoting cardiac surgery, and beginning to use new therapies such as anticoagulants and arterial blood transfusions. Regarding digestive system diseases, the understanding of the etiology of gastric and duodenal ulcers has been corrected, and the application of advanced Soviet treatment experience has improved the diagnosis and treatment of acute pancreatitis. Hospitals in major cities have successively established blood banks and widely applied blood transfusion therapy.

In terms of infectious and parasitic diseases: the plague epidemic can now be controlled; thanks to the strengthening of port quarantine work and the adoption of effective preventive measures, no cases of true cholera have been found in the country for six years, mercilessly defeating the reactionary theory that China has periodic cholera outbreaks; due to universal vaccination, except for border and mountainous areas, there are basically no cases of smallpox in the country; a series of effective measures have also been taken for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, paragonimiasis, clonorchiasis, malaria, kala-azar, etc.

In terms of tuberculosis, prevention and control institutions have been established in major cities and large factories and mines across the country. According to statistics at the end of 1954, there were more than 50 prevention and control institutions directly under the Ministry of Health, more than six times the number before liberation. The incidence and mortality rates of tuberculosis have been greatly reduced. Taking the mortality rate of tuberculosis in Beijing as an example, if it was 100 in 1949, it was reduced to 36 in 1954. The Soviet classification method and medical sports for pulmonary tuberculosis have been widely adopted by tuberculosis physicians across the country and have achieved good results. From liberation to the end of 1954, a total of 3 million infants and young children were vaccinated with BCG, which played an important role in preventing these infants and young children from contracting tuberculosis.

In terms of surgery, due to the establishment of blood banks in many hospitals, the number and types of major operations have increased. The amount of blood transfusions in 1951 increased to four times that of 1947. Endotracheal anesthesia has been widely used in teaching hospitals and hospitals in large cities. The mortality rate of various major operations has been significantly reduced compared with before liberation. For example, the mortality rate of subtotal thyroidectomy was 5.2% in 1947, but it had been reduced to 1.27% in 1953; the mortality rate of lobectomy was 11.1% in 1947, but it had been reduced to 2.59% in 1953.

In terms of obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics: in order to find out the patterns of certain diseases in Chinese obstetrics and gynecology and better serve mothers and infants, the editorial board of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Journal has repeatedly mobilized major hospitals across the country to provide materials for comprehensive analysis. For example, more than 2,300 cases of cesarean section have been published. The advanced Soviet experience of painless childbirth is being promoted in various places, and the highest success rate in maternity hospitals has reached more than 90%. The work of preventing infant infectious diseases is also being vigorously promoted and has achieved good results. For example, the national measles mortality rate in 1954 has decreased by more than 80% compared with 1950. The national infant mortality rate has been significantly reduced compared with before liberation.

In other fields, such as ophthalmology, thanks to learning from Academician Filatov's corneal transplantation technique in the Soviet Union, 500 blind people have regained their sight; learning salivary gland transplantation to treat dry eye has also achieved satisfactory results. Otorhinolaryngology has achieved independent development, and new achievements have been made in treatment methods, such as the treatment effect of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma has been greatly improved. Great achievements have also been made in dermatology and venereology, radiology, hygiene, and stomatology. In particular, in terms of hygiene, thanks to the vigorous development of the patriotic health campaign in various places over the past four years, an extremely broad path has been opened up for China's health and epidemic prevention work.

    我国临床医学几年来取得显著成就
    卫生部医学科学研究委员会最近总结了解放以来我国临床医学进展的情况。几年来我国临床医学各科都取得显著成就，这些成就对人民保健事业起了重大的保证作用。
    内科学方面，开始了积累中国人的生理常值（血球数、血型、血清酵素等）。对于心脏病，改进和普遍地应用心电图检查，开始应用心脏导管检查，因而提高了先天性心脏病的诊断，协助推动了心脏外科手术，并开始运用抗凝剂、动脉输血等新疗法。关于消化系疾患，端正了对胃、十二指肠溃疡病因学的认识，并应用先进的苏联治疗经验，使对急性胰腺炎的诊断和治疗得到提高。各大城市的医院相继成立血库，普遍应用输血疗法。
    传染病和寄生虫病方面：鼠疫的流行已经可以控制；由于海港检疫工作的加强和采取有效的预防措施，六年以来全国没发现一个真性霍乱的病例，无情地击败了中国有周期性霍乱发生的反动学说；由于普遍种痘的结果，除了边区和山区以外，基本上全国已经没有天花的病例；血吸虫病、肺吸虫病、肝吸虫病、疟疾、黑热病等的防治，也都进行了一系列的有效措施。
    结核病方面，全国各主要城市和大型厂矿都成立了防治机构，据一九五四年年底的统计，仅卫生部直属的防治机构就有五十多所，比解放前增加了六倍多。结核病的发病率和死亡率已经大大降低。以北京市结核病的死亡率为例，如一九四九年为一百，一九五四年则降低为三十六。苏联对肺结核病的分类法和医疗体育，已为全国结核病科医师普遍采用，并收到了很好的效果。从解放到一九五四年年底，共有三百万个婴幼儿进行了卡介苗接种，对预防这些婴幼儿的患结核病起了重要作用。
    外科学方面，由于很多医院建立起血库，大手术的数目和种类都增加了，一九五一年的输血量增加到一九四七年的四倍。气管内麻醉在教学医院和大城市的医院中已经普遍应用。各种大手术的死亡率，比解放前显著降低。如甲状腺大部切除术的死亡率，一九四七年是百分之五点二，一九五三年则已降低为百分之一点二七；肺叶切除术的死亡率，一九四七年是百分之十一点一，一九五三年则已降为百分之二点五九。
    妇产科学和小儿科学方面：为了找出中国妇产科若干病症的规律，更好地为母亲和婴儿服务，妇产科杂志编辑委员会曾经几次发动全国各大医院提供材料，加以综合分析。如关于剖腹产术，已经发表了二千三百多例。苏联的先进经验无痛分娩法各地正在推行，产院中最高的成功率已经达到百分之九十以上。预防婴儿传染病的工作也在大力推行，并获得了很好的效果，如全国麻疹病死亡率，一九五四年已较一九五○年减少百分之八十多。全国婴儿死亡率和解放以前比较，已经显著降低。
    其他如眼科学方面，由于学习了苏联费拉托夫院士的角膜移植术，已经使五百个盲者重见天日；学习腮腺管移植术，治疗干眼症，也得到了满意的效果。耳鼻咽喉科学得到了独立的发展，并且治疗方法上也有了新的成就，如鼻咽腔纤维血管瘤等的治疗效果已经大大提高。皮肤性病学、放射学、卫生学、口腔学等方面，也都取得了很大的成就。特别是卫生学方面，由于四年以来各地积极开展爱国卫生运动，给我国卫生防疫工作开辟了极为广阔的道路。
