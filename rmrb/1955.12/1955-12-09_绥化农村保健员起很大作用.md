In rural Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, over 720 agricultural production cooperatives now have health workers. In August of this year, the county's health department trained the first batch of 564 rural health workers through short-term training classes. After intensive training, these health workers have mastered basic knowledge of hygiene and epidemic prevention, surgical first aid and treatment, and maternal and child health care, and have also learned how to use several over-the-counter medicines.

Rural health workers are warmly welcomed by the masses. During the busy farming seasons, health workers go deep into the fields to work, providing timely treatment to patients, reducing the suffering of cooperative members, and enabling them to quickly return to production without affecting their labor income. Health workers not only provide treatment but also carry out disease prevention work in conjunction with current rural production. For example, during the autumn harvest, Sun Fu, the health worker of Quanfa Village Agricultural Cooperative in Qinjia District, personally boiled water for the cooperative members to drink in order to prevent them from contracting gastrointestinal infectious diseases, and helped to ensure food and environmental hygiene. As a result, no one in the cooperative fell ill during the busy labor. In Cooperation Village, Sanhe District, swine fever and chicken plague used to be common, and people often suffered from typhoid fever. Based on this past situation, the five health workers in this village, in conjunction with manure accumulation, led everyone in carrying out the autumn patriotic health campaign, clearing out manure, garbage, and other accumulated waste from the past few years. From then on, every household paid attention to hygiene, preventing the occurrence of infectious diseases and typhoid fever, and also preventing the epidemic of swine fever and chicken plague.

In order to improve the technical level of health workers, the Suihua County Health Department stipulates that each district should designate a doctor to contact the health workers in each village and hold regular meetings to help health workers learn and solve problems existing in their work. Now, the Suihua County Health Department has transferred more than 30 doctors and heads of health centers from various districts to help health workers carry out the winter patriotic health campaign in the countryside.

    绥化农村保健员起很大作用
    黑龙江省绥化县的农村中，有七百二十多个农业生产合作社里有了保健员。今年八月，县的卫生部门又用开短期训练班的方法，训练出第一批农村保健员五百六十四名。这批保健员经过集中训练，都掌握了卫生防疫、外科急救和治疗以及妇幼保健等常识，并学会了几种成药的使用方法。
    农村保健员受到群众的热烈欢迎。在紧张劳动的季节里，保健员都深入田间工作，对病患者及时进行治疗，减少了社员的痛苦，同时也能使社员很快地继续参加生产，不影响他们的劳动收入。保健员不单是做治疗工作，同时还结合农村当前生产进行疾病的预防工作。例如在秋收时，秦家区全发村农业合作社保健员孙富，为了预防社员得胃肠传染病，就亲自给社员烧开水喝，并帮助作好饮食卫生和环境卫生工作，因此，这个社全体社员在紧张的劳动中没有一个得病的。三河区合作村，过去经常闹猪瘟、鸡瘟，人也常得伤寒病。这个村的五名保健员根据过去这种情况，结合积肥工作，带动大家开展了秋季爱国卫生运动，清除了几年来积存的粪便、垃圾等。从此家家户户都讲究卫生，制止了传染病、伤寒病的发生，也防止了猪瘟、鸡瘟的流行。
    绥化县卫生部门为了提高保健员的技术水平，规定各区指定一名医生同各村保健员取得联系，并定期召开会议，帮助保健员学习和解决工作中存在的问题。现在绥化县卫生部门已从各区抽调三十多名医生和卫生所长，下乡帮助保健员开展冬季爱国卫生运动。
