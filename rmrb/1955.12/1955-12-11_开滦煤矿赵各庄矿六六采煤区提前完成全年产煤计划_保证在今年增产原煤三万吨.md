To the Editors:

    The workers of the No. 66 Coal Mining District of the Zhao Gezhuang Mine, Kailuan Coal Mine, completed the annual coal production plan for this year on November 13th, 48 days ahead of schedule. The consumption of pit props was also reduced by 17 percent compared to the state quota.

    The main reason we were able to achieve such results is because, under the leadership of the Party and higher authorities, all employees launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and learned and promoted advanced experiences. In February this year, the tunneling work in our mining district was on the verge of falling behind the mining work. All employees put forward the slogan "Complete tunneling on time to ensure uninterrupted mining." Each group properly arranged tunneling tasks and launched a competition. As a result, the tunneling efficiency increased from 2.5 meters per person per day to more than 4 meters, completing the task five days ahead of schedule, ensuring that the mining work could be carried out seamlessly. In the competition, we learned and promoted advanced experiences such as laying metal mesh, the triangular prop removal method, and cyclical operations, which greatly improved the production level of the entire district and the technical level of the workers. This summer, Zhang Lianyou, a worker in our district, learned about the experience of laying metal mesh at the Datong Mining Bureau while recuperating in Beidaihe, and promoted it in the team after returning. The original work of two people connecting the mesh and four people supporting the pillars has now been changed to one person connecting the mesh and two people supporting the pillars, doubling the efficiency. Worker Zhao Fuqin created an advanced prop removal method with a prop removal winch, which allows three people to do the work of seven in the past. Previously, one person watched one electric scraper, but now it has been improved to one person watching three. After promoting the triangular prop removal method from the Tangjiazhuang Mine, the pit prop recovery rate increased from 60 percent to 95 percent.

    All of our employees are determined to contribute to the completion of the First Five-Year Plan! We guarantee to increase raw coal production by 30,000 tons more than the state plan this year, and save another 100 cubic meters of pit props; at the same time, we will also do a good job in preparing for next year's production and welcome the higher state plan for 1956.

    开滦煤矿赵各庄矿六六采煤区提前完成全年产煤计划
    保证在今年增产原煤三万吨编辑同志：
    我们开滦煤矿赵各庄矿六六采煤区的职工已经在十一月十三日提前四十八天完成了今年全年产煤计划，坑木消耗量也比国家定额降低了百分之十七。
    我们所以能够取得这样的成绩，主要是因为在党和上级的领导下，全体职工开展了增产节约竞赛，学习和推广了先进经验。今年二月间，我们采煤区的掘进工作眼看要赶不上回采了，全体职工就提出“按时完成掘进，保证不误回采”的口号。各组都把掘进任务妥为安排，开展了竞赛。结果掘进效率由三个人日进二公尺半提高到四公尺多，提前五天完成了任务，保证了回采工作能够衔接地进行。在竞赛中，我们学习和推广了铺金属网、三角回柱法和循环作业等先进经验，大大地提高了全区的生产水平和工人的技术水平。我们区的工人张连友今年夏天在北戴河休养的时候，学习了大同矿务局铺金属网的经验，回来后在小组推广。本来是两个人连网、四个人支柱的工作，现在改为一个人连网、两个人支柱，效率提高了一倍。工人赵福勤创造了回柱绞车的先进回柱法，三个人就可以做过去七个人的工作。从前一个人看一部电溜子，现在提高到一个人看三部。在推广了唐家庄矿的三角回柱法以后，坑木回收率由百分之六十提高到百分之九十五。
    我们全体职工决心要为完成第一个五年计划立功！我们保证今年要比国家计划增产原煤三万吨，再节约坑木一百立方公尺；同时还要做好明年的生产准备工作，迎接一九五六年更高额的国家计划。
