The booming agricultural cooperativization movement will transform the individual operation of farmers into collective operation. This change solves many problems that individual farmers could not solve in agricultural production, and also raises many problems that have not been encountered in the past, namely, the management of semi-socialist and socialist agricultural enterprise organizations; the manufacturing and use of new agricultural tools, agricultural machinery, agricultural electricity, and chemical fertilizers; and the application and creation of modern science and technology achievements in increasing production measures for agricultural plants and animals. This series of new problems requires our agricultural science and technology workers, agricultural production workers, and the vast number of farmers to study and solve together.

In order to solve these problems, we must fully mobilize all the agricultural science and technology forces in the country, actively, systematically, and step-by-step carry out scientific research work according to the overall plan for agricultural development, find solutions to various problems in a timely manner, and at the same time, step up the training of a large number of agricultural science experts and greatly expand the agricultural science team.

At present, our country's agricultural science strength is not commensurate with the actual needs. The total number of senior agricultural science and technology experts in the country, equivalent to associate professors or above, is only about one thousand. Among these one thousand or so people, professors and associate professors from the thirty-four higher agricultural and forestry schools add up to about eight hundred. This means that most of the senior agricultural science experts are concentrated in higher agricultural and forestry schools. When mobilizing the national agricultural science force, this fact must be taken into account, and the scientific force of higher agricultural and forestry schools must be fully mobilized.

In universities and colleges, not only professors and associate professors have the ability to conduct scientific research, but lecturers, teaching assistants, and graduate students also have research capabilities, and undergraduates are also an important force. Organizing the strength of professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, graduate students, and undergraduates can enable us to carry out more research work. Lecturers, teaching assistants, graduate students, and undergraduates can not only serve as research assistants to professors, but their own research work can often produce valuable results. At present, the number of teachers and students in various higher agricultural and forestry schools ranges from a few hundred to one or two thousand, and it is increasing rapidly. Judging from the current situation, some of the larger colleges and universities have a scientific research force that is no less than that of a medium-sized or small scientific research institute. Therefore, from the perspective of scientific research, we should completely regard each higher agricultural and forestry school as a scientific research unit, assign it certain research tasks, and fully utilize its scientific research strength.

The scientific research work of higher agricultural and forestry schools can not only make contributions to agricultural production, but also improve the quality of teaching, and it is the most fundamental way to improve the quality of teaching. Therefore, scientific research work must be carried out in universities and colleges. Carrying out scientific research work in higher agricultural and forestry schools is not contradictory to teaching work. The reason for saying that there is a contradiction is mainly that two issues have not been handled properly: one is the arrangement of research time, and the other is the methods and means of research work. These two issues have different characteristics in universities and colleges compared to specialized scientific research institutions. In terms of the arrangement of research time, because teachers have teaching tasks, they must generally first meet the requirements of teaching tasks before considering carrying out scientific research work. Therefore, a teacher should first focus their efforts on teaching work before they have the necessary mastery of teaching work. But as long as it is arranged well, some research work can generally be carried out, but the amount should not be heavy, and the scope should not be large, but should be adapted to the time left over from teaching work. Grasping this point, there is no contradiction between research work and teaching work. As for teachers who have completely or almost completely mastered teaching work, as long as the arrangement of time adapts to the characteristics of teaching being dispersed and discontinuous, and teachers provide appropriate mutual assistance and coordination in their work when necessary (such as substitute teaching), they can squeeze out a short period of continuous time and solve the seasonality of research work to a certain extent, as well as the time required to go to the countryside to do research work. This approach has been effective and has had good experience among many teachers. Some older teachers feel that research work is mainly in conflict with too many meetings, too many activities, and work that cannot be fully planned. This is indeed a big problem. This contradiction has been gradually resolved in the past two years, but it has not been completely resolved. Currently, the administrative departments of various schools and relevant parties are continuing to make further efforts in this regard, and the problem will eventually be properly resolved. Regarding the methods and means of research work, in specialized research institutions, the main researchers have the necessary number of full-time research assistants to assist in the work; however, in universities and colleges, there are no full-time research assistants, or only a few individuals. This is a difficulty, and we ask to gradually resolve this difficulty. We ourselves also have some ways to overcome this difficulty, the most important of which is to improve the methods and means of research work so that it adapts to the characteristics of scientific personnel in universities and colleges. In universities and colleges, there are a large number of lecturers, teaching assistants, graduate students, and undergraduates, each with different abilities and time. This is the characteristic of scientific personnel in universities and colleges. We must adapt our research work to this characteristic, and we must make full use of this characteristic, that is, take our own research work as the center, combine it with the research work of lecturers, teaching assistants, and graduate students, and combine it with the scientific groups, production internships, and graduation theses of undergraduates, to form a systematic and collective large research topic. This will not only give young people intimate guidance, but also enable their own research work to receive strong assistance. Therefore, carrying out scientific research work in universities and colleges, even if there are contradictions, the problem is not whether there are contradictions, but whether we are good at overcoming contradictions.

In universities and colleges, teachers can spend a lot of time on scientific research work. According to the situation in the Soviet Union, due to the characteristics of teaching work in universities and colleges, each teacher's workload is six hours per day, while the teaching workload is generally only three hours per day, and the other three hours are devoted to scientific research work. In the past few years, the higher agricultural and forestry schools in our country have had relatively small enrollment tasks, and the direct teaching workload of teachers is relatively small. Taking Beijing Agricultural University as an example, according to statistics in 1954, the average daily direct teaching workload of teachers was only 0.7 hours for professors, 0.8 hours for associate professors, 0.9 hours for lecturers, and 1.2 hours for teaching assistants. According to our calculations, by 1958, the number of students enrolled will be four times the current number. At that time, the teaching workload of teachers can reach the Soviet standard. The situation in some of the larger agricultural and forestry colleges and universities is similar to that of Beijing Agricultural University. After the teaching workload is full, there is still a lot of time to do research work. From the perspective of the country's increasingly expanding enrollment tasks, the number of teachers is very insufficient, but from the perspective of a school, there is always a considerable amount of research work time.

The scientific level of teachers in higher agricultural and forestry schools is relatively high. Many teachers have rich experience in scientific research and teaching. According to statistics from Beijing Agricultural University in 1954, there were a total of 273 teachers in the school, among whom 5 had been engaged in teaching and scientific research for more than 30 years, 24 for more than 20 years, and 37 for more than 10 years. Many of them are specialized experts, and their research work has yielded many valuable results. In plant protection, agricultural chemicals, soil, fertilizer, plant breeding, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, horticulture, agricultural economics, etc., they have made more or less contributions to the country's agricultural production, and some basic scientific and basic theoretical research has also achieved some fairly high-level results. Moreover, in the past two or three years, the scientific research work of higher agricultural and forestry schools has gradually expanded, and some schools have shown a thriving atmosphere. According to my knowledge of the scientific research topics of higher agricultural and forestry colleges and universities in 1955, there were 906 items officially included in the school plan in twelve colleges and universities. It is estimated that the total number of higher agricultural and forestry colleges and universities in the country will be no less than 1,500. In some schools, more than half of the teachers have participated in research work. In 1954, Beijing Agricultural University had 109 research projects, with the number of participants reaching 55.6% of the total number of teachers in the school; in 1955, there were 147 research projects, with the number of participants reaching 64% of the total number of teachers in the school. The situations in Nanjing Agricultural College, South China Agricultural College, Central China Agricultural College, Northwest Agricultural College, Agricultural College of Sichuan University, Hunan Agricultural College, etc. are similar to those of Beijing Agricultural University. It can be seen that the enthusiasm of teachers in higher agricultural and forestry colleges and universities to carry out scientific research work is quite high.

From the above-mentioned situation, it is not only necessary but also entirely possible to carry out scientific research work in higher agricultural and forestry colleges and universities. However, from the perspective of the urgent tasks put forward by the rapid development of agricultural cooperativization, the current research work is still far from enough. In this regard, we still need to make many efforts. In order to vigorously carry out the scientific research work of higher agricultural and forestry colleges and universities, I think the following three things should be started immediately:

First, the school's research work should be arranged in accordance with the overall agricultural plan formulated by the Party, so that it can fully reflect the problems in agricultural production; a re-evaluation and consideration should be made of the existing research work. The issues that should be paid attention to in the work arrangement are: regarding the issue of whether the goal of research work is for "today" or "tomorrow," the correct answer should be to seize "today" and actively prepare for "tomorrow," and the main force should be placed on the most common and important key issues in production. Regarding the issue of "popularization" and "improvement," we should take both into account in principle. From the national perspective, we must ensure that there are enough people to do popularization work. Regarding the issue of "field research" and "laboratory and experimental field research," we should adopt corresponding methods depending on the nature of the topic. In short, the arrangement of scientific research work in a school should closely combine it with the needs of the country. Within this scope, we should do what is possible and what research we have expertise in. From the perspective of the national scientific force plan, we should organize and comprehensively and systematically carry out research to meet the needs of all aspects; but from the perspective of a school or a researcher, we can only do a small part of it, or just do some point work. If the research work of a school is within the scope of the national agricultural overall plan, and if the efforts are placed on the most important aspects as much as possible when arranging the research work of the entire school, then the research work of this school should be considered to have been initially incorporated into the track of the national plan. In order to do a good job in arranging the school's scientific research work, in addition to working under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education, we must take the initiative to establish close contact with the production leadership organs and scientific leadership organs, solicit their opinions, and obtain their guidance. This is very important.

Second, we must take some specific measures to link research work with production practice and the production activities of the vast number of farmers. According to the characteristics of universities and colleges, we can take two approaches: one is to select several agricultural production cooperatives in the rural areas near the school, and establish organized and planned contact with them, and be responsible for guiding their work. The second is to mobilize old scientists to establish close contact with certain production units or labor models, and regularly care about the units they are connected with. With the arrival of the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, many farmers, in order to increase production, have demarcated small plots of land on the land of their cooperatives to conduct comparative demonstration research work. This spontaneous scientific activity of farmers not only has the most extensive practical production significance, but also will form a vast scientific team, which will become an important part of the agricultural scientific research force. Scientific workers in universities and colleges must fully value this significant event and cultivate and help them. If each of our teachers can establish scientific and technical connections with one or two agricultural production cooperatives, they may be able to do a lot of meaningful work.

Third, we must give full play to the spirit of collectivism and organize comprehensive research. At present, the spirit of collectivism in scientific research in our higher agricultural and forestry schools is relatively poor. A school has many research topics, almost one research topic per person, and the connection between each other is very poor. This is a waste of research work power and is not in line with the comprehensiveness of agricultural science. We must strive to gradually improve this situation, comprehensively organize the topics that can and must be comprehensively researched, and give full play to the spirit of collectivism, so that we can most effectively and centrally solve those major, universal, and key issues. For example, to solve the problem of close planting of small seedlings or increasing the yield per unit area of a certain crop, we must organize cultivation, planting, breeding, soil, agricultural chemistry, plant protection, and basic science departments such as plant physiology, chemistry, and physics, to jointly plan, unify goals, and divide labor to cooperate in research, concentrate the expertise and wisdom of all parties, and quickly obtain more satisfactory results. In the past two years, at the Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, according to the tasks given by the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, many teaching and research groups (including the physics teaching and research group) were mobilized to jointly solve the problem of preventing and eliminating weeds in large fields. Due to collective cooperation and comprehensive research, effective methods were found in two years and the Stalin Prize was won. This is an example we should learn from. Another way to give play to the spirit of collectivism and carry out comprehensive research is to cooperate with scientific research institutions and production units outside the school, that is, to closely cooperate with the scientific research institutes of the Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Agriculture, and the relevant work departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture, and organize the scientific force in a larger scope. This is an effective method in many places and many schools, and it is also a very important method. We should continue to do it vigorously in the future.

In order to smoothly organize the school's scientific research work and give full play to its power, it is necessary to organize teachers to deeply study Comrade Mao Zedong's report on agricultural cooperativization, the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee on agricultural cooperativization, and the report on the first five-year plan and its related plans. In this study, in addition to systematically understanding the specific content of various major issues, we must especially deeply understand from the ideological point of view the era in which our country and ourselves are located, and strive to complete a series of urgent and major tasks put forward by the upsurge of cooperativization and its development for agricultural science and technology.

    发挥高等农林学校的科学研究力量为农业合作化服务
    北京农业大学副校长　施平
    正在蓬勃发展的农业合作化运动，将使农民的个体经营改变为集体经营。这个改变，解决了农业生产问题上农民个体经营所不能解决的许多问题，也提出了许多过去所没有碰到过的问题，即半社会主义的、社会主义的农业企业组织的经营管理问题；新式农具、农业机械、农业电气、化学肥料的制造和使用问题；在农业植物、农业动物的增产措施上，现代科学、技术成就的应用和创造问题。这一系列的新的问题，要我们的农业科学、技术工作者和农业生产工作者及广大农民一道去研究、解决。
    为了解决这些问题，必须把全国现在所有的农业科学技术力量全面地动员起来，按照农业发展的全面规划，积极地、有计划地、有步骤地展开科学研究工作，及时找出解决各项问题的办法，同时加紧培养大批农业科学专家，大大扩大农业科学的队伍。
    目前我们国家的农业科学力量和实际的需要相比，是不相适应的。全国现有的、相当于大学副教授以上的高级农业科学技术专家，总共只有一千人左右。而在这一千人左右当中，三十四所高等农林学校的教授、副教授合计起来就有八百人左右。这就是说，大部分的高级农业科学专家是集中在高等农林学校里面。在动员全国农业科学力量的时候，必须考虑到这一个事实，把高等农林学校的科学力量充分地动员起来。
    在高等学校中，不仅教授和副教授有科学研究的能力，讲师、助教、研究生也有研究能力，大学生也是一个重要的力量。把教授、讲师、助教、研究生和大学生的力量组织起来，就能够进行更多的研究工作。讲师、助教、研究生和大学生不仅可以作为教授的研究助手，他们本身的研究工作往往也能产生很有价值的结果。目前各个高等农林学校的教师和学生的数目，少的有几百人，多的一二千人，而且还在迅速地增加着。就从目前的情况来看，一些规模比较大的院、校，他们的科学研究力量不下于一个中、小型的科学研究所。所以从科学研究方面来说，我们完全应当把每一个高等农林学校都当作一个科学研究单位，交给它一定的研究任务，充分地发挥它的科学研究力量。
    高等农林学校的科学研究工作，除了能够在农业生产上作出贡献之外，同时能够提高教学质量，而且是提高教学质量的最根本的道路，所以在高等学校中必须进行科学研究工作。在高等农林学校中进行科学研究工作，同教学工作本来是没有矛盾的。所以说有矛盾，主要是在两个问题上没有处理得恰当。一个是研究时间的安排问题，另一个是研究工作的方式方法问题。这两个问题在高等学校比之专门的科学研究机关是有它不同的特点的。在研究时间的安排问题上，因为教师有教学的任务，一般地必须首先满足教学任务的要求，然后才去考虑进行科学研究工作，因此，一个教师，对于教学工作还没有必要的掌握以前，是应该把自己的力量首先放在教学工作上的。但只要安排得好，一般地也能进行一些研究工作，只是份量不能重，范围不能大，要同教学工作所余的时间相适应。掌握了这一点，研究工作同教学工作就没有矛盾。至于已经完全或者差不多完全掌握了教学工作的教师，只要时间的安排上适应教学分散、不连续的特点，在必要时教师之间在工作上进行适当的互助、调配（如代课），就可以挤出一段较短的连续的时间，就能够在一定程度上解决研究工作的季节性的问题，以及下乡去做研究工作所需要的时间问题。这一个做法在许多教师中已经行之有效，并且已经有了很好的经验了。在有些老教师中，感觉到研究工作主要是同会议多、活动多、工作还不能完全计划化相矛盾。这确实是一个大问题。这个矛盾这两年来已经逐步解决，但是还没有完全解决。对于这一点，目前各个学校行政和有关方面还在继续作进一步的努力，问题终会得到适当解决的。关于研究工作的方式、方法问题，在专业研究机构里，主要的研究者有着必要数量的专职助理研究人员，协助进行工作；但在高等学校，就还没有或只有个别的专职助理研究人员。这是一个困难，我们要求逐步解决这个困难。我们自己也还有一些克服这个困难的办法，最主要的是改进研究工作的方式、方法，使它适应于高等学校科学人力的特点。在高等学校中，有着大量的讲师、助教、研究生和大学生，各自有着不同的能力和时间，这就是高等学校科学人力的特点。我们进行研究工作要适应这个特点，并且要充分利用这个特点，这就是以自己的研究工作作为中心，同讲师、助教、研究生的研究工作结合起来，并且同大学生的科学小组、生产实习、毕业论文结合起来，结成为一个系统的、集体性研究的大题目。这样既能给年轻人以亲切的指导，又能使自己的研究工作得到有力的协助。所以，在高等学校中进行科学研究工作，即使是有矛盾的话，问题不在于是否有矛盾，问题在于我们是否善于克服矛盾。
    在高等学校中，教师可以用在科学研究工作上的时间是不少的。根据苏联的情况，由于高等学校教学工作的特点，每一个教师每天的工作量是六小时，而教学工作量一般每天只有三个小时，另外的三小时是从事科学研究工作的。过去几年，我国的高等农林学校，因为招生任务比较小，目前教师直接的教学工作量（同学生见面的）是比较小的。以北京农业大学来说，据一九五四年的统计，教师平均每天的直接教学工作量，教授只有零点七小时，副教授只有零点八小时，讲师只有零点九小时，助教只有一点二小时。我们试算的结果，到一九五八年在校学生数为现在的四倍，那时，教师的教学工作量可以达到苏联的标准，一些比较大的农林院、校的情况，也是和北京农业大学的情况差不多的。到了教学工作量满了以后，还是有不少时间可以做研究工作的。从全国日益扩大的招生任务来看，教师的数量是很不够的，但从一个学校来说，总是有相当多的研究工作时间的。
    高等农林学校教师的科学水平是比较高的。许多教师有丰富的科学研究和教学的经验。北京农业大学一九五四年的统计，全校共有教师二百七十三人，他们当中从事教学和科学研究工作三十年以上的有五人，二十年以上的有二十四人，十年以上的有三十七人。他们中的许多人是学有专长的专家，他们的研究工作已得到了许多有价值的结果，在植物保护、农用药剂、土壤、肥料、植物育种、畜牧、兽医、园艺、农业经济等方面，都已经对国家的农业生产作出了或多或少的贡献，若干基本科学和基本理论的研究也有了一些水平相当高的成绩。而且在最近两三年来，高等农林学校的科学研究工作已逐渐展开，有些学校已有蓬勃发展的气象。一九五五年度全国高等农林院校的科学研究题目，根据我所知道的十二个院、校的情况，正式订在学校计划中的就有九百零六项。估计全国高等农林院校合计将不下于一千五百项。有些学校中半数以上的教师已参加了研究工作。北京农业大学在一九五四年就有研究工作一百零九项，参加人数达全校教师总数的百分之五十五点六；一九五五年的研究工作有一百四十七项，参加人数达全校教师总数的百分之六十四。南京农学院、华南农学院、华中农学院、西北农学院、四川大学农学院、湖南农学院等的情况，也同北京农业大学相似。可以看出，目前高等农林院校的教师们开展科学研究工作的积极性是相当高的。
    从上面所说的情况来看，在高等农林院校开展科学研究工作，不但是必要的，而且完全可能。但是，从农业合作化迅速发展所提出的迫切任务来看，目前的研究工作还是很不够的，在这方面，我们还须要作许多的努力。为了大力开展高等农林院校的科学研究工作，我觉得下面的三件事是应当立即着手进行的：
    第一、要按照党所制定的农业全面规划来安排学校的研究工作，使它能充分反映农业生产中的问题；对现有的研究工作要作一番重新的估计和考虑。工作安排中应注意的问题是：关于研究工作的目标是为“今天”还是“明天”的问题，正确的答案应该是抓紧“今天”，积极地准备“明天”，主要的力量应放在生产上最普遍、最重要的关键问题上。关于“普及”和“提高”的问题，原则上要兼顾，从全国来说，必须保证有足够的人力做普及工作。关于“大田研究”和“实验室、试验地研究”的问题，要看是什么性质的题目，采取相应的方式。总之，一个学校的科学研究工作的安排要使它密切结合国家的需要，在这个范围内，可能做什么就做什么，有什么专材就做什么研究。从全国科学力量的规划说，应该组织起来，全面地、系统地展开研究，以适应各方面的需要；但从一个学校或一个研究人员来说，就只能在其中做一小部分，或者只是做某些点的工作。如果一个学校的各项研究工作都是在国家农业全面规划范围内的，而且在安排全校的研究工作的时候，侭可能地把力量放在了最主要的方面，那末这个学校的研究工作，就应该算是初步纳入国家计划的轨道了。为了做好学校科学研究工作的安排，除了在高等教育部的直接领导之下进行工作以外，我们必须同生产领导机关、科学领导机关主动地取得密切联系，征求他们的意见，取得他们的指导，这是十分重要的。
    第二、要采取一些具体的做法，使研究工作同生产实际、广大农民的生产活动联系起来。根据高等学校的特点，我们可以采取两种做法：一是在学校附近的农村中，选择几个农业生产合作社，有组织有计划地同他们发生联系，负责指导他们的工作。二是要发动老科学家们同一定的生产单位或劳动模范发生密切联系，经常地关心他们所联系的单位。随着农业合作化高潮的到来，许许多多的农民，为了增加生产，在他们合作社的土地上，划出小块土地进行对比示范性质的研究工作。这种农民自发的科学活动，不但有着最广泛的实际的生产意义，而且它将形成一支广大的科学队伍，将要成为农业科学研究力量的一个重要组成部分。高等学校的科学工作者们，必须充分重视这个意义重大的事情，对他们加以培养和帮助。我们的每一位教师如果能够同一两处农业生产合作社发生科学、技术上的联系，就可能做很多有意义的工作。
    第三、要充分发挥集体主义的精神，组织综合性的研究。现在我们高等农林学校科学研究的集体主义精神是比较差的。一个学校有许多的研究题目，差不多是一人一个研究题目，彼此的衔接性很差，这是研究工作力量的浪费，是同农业科学的综合性不相符合的。必须努力逐步改进这个情况，把可能和必须综合研究的题目综合组织起来，充分发挥集体主义精神，这样才能最有效地、集中地去解决那些主要的、普遍性的和关键性的问题。例如解决小株密植或者某一种作物增加单位面积产量的问题，我们就要组织耕作、栽培、育种、土壤、农业化学、植物保护以及植物生理、化学、物理学等基础科学部门，共同计划，统一目标，分工合作地进行研究，集中各方面的专长和智慧，才能迅速得到比较完满的结果。前两年，在莫斯科季米里亚捷夫农学院，根据苏联农业部所给的任务，曾动员许多教研组（包括物理学教研组）的力量，共同解决防除大田中杂草的问题，由于集体合作，综合研究，在两年中就找出了行之有效的办法，获得了斯大林奖金。这是我们应该学习的榜样。发挥集体主义精神和开展综合研究的另一个办法是同校外的科学研究机关及生产单位合作，即同科学院、农业部的科学研究所、农业部、农业厅的有关工作部门密切合作，把科学力量在更大的范围内组织起来。这是在许多地方、许多学校行之有效的办法，也是很重要的办法，今后我们应该继续大力去做。
    为了顺利地组织学校的科学研究工作，充分发挥它的力量，要组织教师深入学习毛泽东同志关于农业合作化问题的报告，中共中央六中全会关于农业合作化问题的决议和第一个五年计划及其有关计划的报告。在这个学习中，除了要系统地了解各项重大问题的具体内容外，特别要从思想上深刻了解到我们国家和我们自己所处的时代，努力完成合作化高潮和它的发展对农业科学技术所提出的一系列的迫切的重大任务。
