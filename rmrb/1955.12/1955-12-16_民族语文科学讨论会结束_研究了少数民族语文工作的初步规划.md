Xinhua News Agency, December 15th. The National Language Science Symposium, which began on December 6th, concluded this morning.

    At this symposium, responsible individuals and representatives from relevant units in various regions, along with ethnic language science workers, presented information on the languages and writing systems of various ethnic minorities and the status of ethnic language work. They exchanged experiences in ethnic language work, exchanged opinions on continuing to assist ethnic minorities in creating, improving, and reforming writing systems, and studied and discussed a preliminary plan for ethnic minority language work. This preliminary plan stipulates that, over the next few years starting in 1956, a comprehensive survey of the languages of all ethnic minorities should be completed. Assistance should be provided to ethnic minorities without writing systems to create them, and plans should be designed to improve and reform the writing systems of ethnic minorities that have incomplete or non-universal writing systems. In 1956, seven national ethnic language science work teams will be organized to carry out this work.

    The symposium pointed out that the people of the ethnic minorities are currently very eager for assistance in creating, improving, and reforming their writing systems. Although ethnic language work has made considerable achievements in the past few years, it lags far behind actual needs. In the future, a more proactive attitude should be adopted to implement the central government's policy of assisting ethnic minorities in creating, improving, and reforming writing systems.

    Liu Geping, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, and Liu Chun, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, gave reports on future ethnic language work at the meeting. In their reports, they pointed out that completing the task of assisting ethnic minorities in creating, improving, and reforming writing systems in a short period of time is a very arduous task. It must be carried out jointly by relevant departments of the central government, relevant units in relevant localities, and cadres and intellectuals of the ethnic groups themselves. In carrying out this work, it is necessary to conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, overcome all obstacles, and oppose conservative thinking; but a cautious attitude must also be adopted.

    Comrade Hu Qiaomu also addressed the meeting. He encouraged ethnic language science workers and all relevant departments to strive to complete the work of assisting ethnic minorities in creating, improving, and reforming writing systems in the next few years. He pointed out that it is necessary to oppose conservatism in ethnic language science work, and hoped that the full strength of ethnic language science workers will be brought into play in carrying out this work, with particular attention to the role of new forces on this front.

    During the symposium, Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of Higher Education, and Lin Liru, Vice Minister of Education, gave reports on the development of higher education and primary and secondary education in ethnic regions, respectively. Luo Changpei, Director of the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, expressed his views on several academic issues related to ethnic languages. Soviet consultant Serdyuchenko and Soviet expert Todaeva also introduced the Soviet Union's experience in assisting ethnic minorities in creating, improving, and reforming writing systems to the meeting.

    民族语文科学讨论会结束
    研究了少数民族语文工作的初步规划
    新华社十五日讯　十二月六日举行的民族语文科学讨论会已经在今天上午结束。
    在这次讨论会上，各地有关单位的负责人和代表以及民族语文科学工作者，介绍了各少数民族的语言文字情况和民族语文工作的情况，交流了民族语文工作的经验，就今后继续帮助少数民族创立、改进和改革文字的工作交换了意见，并且研究和讨论了少数民族语文工作的初步规划。这个初步规划规定，在从一九五六年开始的几年时间内，要完成对各少数民族语言的普遍调查工作，帮助尚无文字的少数民族创立出文字，帮助虽然有文字但是文字不完备、不通用的少数民族设计出改进和改革文字的方案。在一九五六年，全国将组织七个民族语文科学工作队进行这一工作。
    讨论会指出，目前少数民族人民对于帮助他们创立、改进和改革文字的要求非常迫切。过去几年来民族语文工作虽然做出了不少的成绩，但是远远地落后于实际的需要。今后应该采取比过去更加积极的态度，贯彻中央关于帮助少数民族创立、改进和改革文字的政策。
    中共中央统一战线工作部副部长、全国人民代表大会民族委员会主任委员刘格平，中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任刘春在会上作了关于今后的民族语文工作的报告。他们在报告中指出，要在短短几年的时间内完成帮助少数民族创立、改进和改革文字的工作，是一项很艰巨的任务。必须由中央有关部门和有关地方的有关单位和本民族的干部和知识分子共同配合进行。在进行这一工作中，要认真地学习苏联的先进经验，克服一切障碍，反对保守思想；但也要采取慎重的态度。
    胡乔木同志也到会讲了话。他勉励民族语文科学工作者和各有关部门为在最近几年内完成帮助少数民族创立、改进和改革文字的工作而努力，指出必须反对民族语文科学工作中的保守主义，并且希望在进行这一工作中充分发挥民族语文科学工作者的全部力量，特别要注意发挥在这一战线上的新生力量。
    讨论会期间，高等教育部副部长曾昭抡、教育部副部长林砺儒，分别在会上作了有关在民族地区发展高等教育和中、小学教育的报告。中国科学院语言研究所所长罗常培对有关民族语言的几个学术性的问题发表了意见。苏联顾问谢尔久琴柯和苏联专家托达叶娃也向会议介绍了苏联帮助少数民族创立、改进和改革文字的经验。
