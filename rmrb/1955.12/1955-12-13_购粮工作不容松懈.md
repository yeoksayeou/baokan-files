    Grain Procurement Work Must Not Be Relaxed
    Ma Anding
    A phenomenon of procrastination has emerged in the grain unified purchase work in many areas. Often, when the amount of grain stored reaches about 85% of the unified purchase task, the progress of the unified purchase work begins to slow down.
    This phenomenon is inseparable from the blind optimism and lax mood of some rural workers. They see that this year's grain harvest is abundant, the broad masses of farmers support the "three fix" policy for grain, and the work in the initial stage of grain purchase is very smooth. Therefore, they believe that the task is easy to complete, and they are unwilling to conduct meticulous publicity and education among the masses, and they have also relaxed the work of organizing the masses to send grain to the warehouse.
    The favorable conditions these comrades see do indeed exist. The correct attitude should be to correctly use these conditions, seize the opportunity, and quickly and correctly complete this year's grain unified purchase task, so that rural workers can free up their hands to concentrate their efforts on completing other arduous tasks. If they only see these favorable conditions and relax the necessary efforts, hoping that the work can be completed naturally, then it is very wrong.
    This procrastination phenomenon must be eliminated immediately. Otherwise, it will have a very bad impact on all aspects of work. First, it will artificially lengthen the time for grain unified purchase work, hindering the rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement to a certain extent. Second, it will arouse the dissatisfaction of farmers who actively sell surplus grain and will encourage the unhealthy trend of some farmers delaying grain delivery. It is even more obvious that this phenomenon will prevent the state from mastering the necessary marketable grain.
    How should this procrastination problem be handled in the grain purchase work? We should deal with it appropriately according to different objects and different situations. For those with unreasonable grain unified purchase figures, appropriate adjustments should be made; for those who originally determined the figures reasonably but intentionally delayed, they should be persuaded to deliver grain quickly through persuasion and education; for individual cases of deliberate delay and failure to deliver grain, which undermine the grain unified purchase decree, necessary punishments should be given. According to inspections in some areas, well-to-do middle peasants account for a considerable proportion of the households that are in arrears with grain. In some areas, holding separate meetings of such farmers, explaining the principles clearly, and mobilizing them to sell surplus grain in full is a feasible method.
    In order to complete the grain unified purchase task as soon as possible, Party committees and governments at all levels should supervise and inspect the grain delivery and storage work, criticize the blind optimism and lax mood of rural workers, and educate the broad masses of farmers to actively sell good grain and support national construction.

    购粮工作不容松懈
    马安鼎
    当前许多地区的粮食统购工作中发生了一种拖延现象。往往粮食入库数量达到统购任务的百分之八十五左右，统购工作的进度就开始迟缓下来。
    这种现象同某些农村工作人员的盲目乐观和松懈情绪分不开。他们看到今年粮食丰收，广大农民拥护粮食“三定”政策，购粮开始阶段的工作非常顺利，就认为任务容易完成，不愿意再对群众进行细致的宣传教育，也放松了组织群众送粮入库的工作。
    这些同志看到的有利条件，都是确实存在着的。正确的态度应该是正确地运用这些条件，抓紧时机，迅速地、正确地完成今年的粮食统购任务，以便使农村工作人员腾出手来，集中力量完成其他方面的繁重的工作。如果只看到这些有利条件，就放松了应有的努力，希望工作能够自然地完成，那就十分错误了。
    必须立即消除这种拖延现象。否则，它会给各方面的工作带来很坏的影响。首先，它会人为地拉长粮食统购工作的时间，在一定程度上妨碍农业合作化运动的迅速发展。其次，它会引起积极出售余粮的农民的不满，会助长部分农民拖延送粮的歪风。至于这种现象会使国家无法掌握必要的商品粮食，那就更加明显了。
    在购粮工作中，应该怎样处理这种拖延问题呢？我们应该根据不同的对象，分别不同的情况，加以适当的处理。对于粮食统购数字不合理的，应该给予适当的调整；对于原来确定的数字合理，但是有意拖欠的，应该通过说服教育，使他们迅速交粮；对于个别故意拖欠不交，破坏粮食统购法令的，应该给予必要的惩处。据有些地区的检查，在拖欠粮食的农户中，富裕中农占相当大的比重。有些地区单独召开这类农户的会议，讲清道理，动员他们如数出售余粮，这是一个可行的办法。
    为了早日完成粮食统购任务，各地党委和政府应该对送粮入库工作加以督促和检查，批判农村工作人员中的盲目乐观和松懈情绪，并且教育广大农民踊跃交售好粮，支援国家建设。
