Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: The vast majority of the more than 120 students who returned from the United States this year have already joined the socialist construction of the motherland, taking up jobs that can utilize their expertise; a small number of students returning from the US will also soon be taking up work positions.

More than 80 of these students returning from the US studied science and engineering. Most of them are engaged in research work in the relevant research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; in addition, some are engaged in teaching and research work in universities and colleges such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, Jiaotong University, and Beijing Institute of Aeronautics. Some are working in departments such as the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. A small number of students who studied finance and economics and medicine are engaged in teaching and research work in higher financial and economic schools and higher medical schools in Shanghai, Wuhan, Chengdu, Harbin and other places.

Aerodynamicist Qian Xuesen is now in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, presiding over the preparatory work for the Institute of Mechanics. Xie Jialin and Li Zhengwu, who work at the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, are engaged in a planned special study. Physicist Du Lianyao studied ultrasonics and radio circuit noise problems at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. He is now working in the electronics teaching and research section of the Department of Physics at Peking University. He is leading graduate students in research on ultrasonics and other issues, and Peking University has allocated special funds for his research experiments. Zhang Xingqian, who works at the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, has already opened a professional course of "Metal Physics" for the fourth-year students of the Department of Metallography and Heat Treatment of Steel, and he is also cooperating with Professor Ke Jun, who returned from the United Kingdom, to prepare for the metal physics major that the college will add in 1956. Economist Xi Ke is working at the Shanghai Institute of Finance and Economics, and his wife, Hao Rying, is working at the East China Institute of Chemical Technology. Qian Xuesen's wife, Jiang Ying, has decided to work in an art unit affiliated with the Ministry of Culture.

    今年归国的留美学生大部走上工作岗位
    新华社三十日讯　今年归国的一百二十多个留美学生绝大部分已经参加了祖国的社会主义建设，担任了能够发挥各人专长的工作；还有少数留美归国学生，不久也要走上工作岗位。
    这批留美学生中有八十多个人是学理工科的。他们大都在中国科学院各有关研究单位担任研究工作；另外，一部分人在北京大学、清华大学、交通大学、北京航空学院等高等学校担任教学和研究工作；有的在第一机械工业部、石油工业部等部门工作。少数学财经和医学的留美学生在上海、武汉、成都、哈尔滨等地的高等财经学校和高等医学校担任教学研究工作。
    空气动力学家钱学森现在在中国科学院主持力学研究所的筹建工作。在中国科学院物理研究所工作的谢家麟和李整武，正在从事计划中的一项专题研究。物理学家杜连耀是在美国宾夕法尼亚大学研究超音波和无线电路噪音问题的，现在他在北京大学物理学系电子学教研室工作。他正在领导研究生作有关超音波等问题的研究，北京大学已拨出了供他研究实验用的专款。在北京钢铁工业学院工作的张兴钤已经为这个学院的金属学及钢铁热处理专业四年级学生开了一门“金属物理学”的专业课程，他还同另一个从英国回来的柯俊教授合作，为学院将要在一九五六年增设的金属物理学专业作准备工作。经济学家席克正在上海财经学院工作，他的爱人郝日英在华东化工学院工作。钱学森的爱人蒋英已经决定到文化部所属的艺术单位工作。
