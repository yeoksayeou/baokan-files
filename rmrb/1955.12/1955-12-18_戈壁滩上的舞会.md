    Dance Party on the Gobi Desert

    On the afternoon of December 3rd, at an oil exploration base in the Qaidam Basin, just after the quitting-time whistle had blown, a noticeable announcement came from the loudspeakers spread across the construction site: Today is Saturday, and there will be a dance party tonight, held in the newly built dining hall.
    Several dance parties have already been held at this oil exploration base, but this is the first time it will be held indoors. Right after dinner, people started installing five-hundred-candlepower light bulbs on the newly installed light fixtures. People who arrived at the dance hall early chatted with their good friends about the week's work; some were busy booking dance partners; and impatient people simply hummed dance tunes and started dancing.
    At eight o'clock, the house was packed with people. The band struck up a beautiful dance tune, and a pair of Kazakh intern fitters were the first to dance, followed by a pair of construction workers. At this time, a man with a "Chapayev" style mustache arrived, and from his dust-covered appearance, one could tell that he came from a geological exploration team roaming in the field. As soon as he entered the door, he shouted, "Hey! I have to have a good dance this time!" While shouting, he invited a dance partner, becoming the third couple to dance. Pairs of people started to spin to the music.
    The floor of the dance hall was still a piece of the Gobi Desert, and the cold made it difficult for the dancers to dance in felt boots, but it did not reduce people's enthusiasm for dancing in the slightest. After two or three dances, the crowded dance floor made it impossible to perform dance steps; the host of the dance party had to make a request: everyone should rotate in the same direction.
    The temperature in Qaidam at night drops to over twenty degrees Celsius below zero, but the dance party was still going on. People forgot the cold of the night, and the ever-increasing enthusiasm for dancing dispelled the fatigue of a week of hard work.

    戈壁滩上的舞会
    新华社记者　金元明
    十二月三日的下午，在柴达木盆地的一个石油探勘基地，下班的汽笛刚刚响过，遍布在工地上的扩音器里传出了令人注意的声音：今天是星期六，晚上有舞会，地点是在新建的食堂里。
    在这个石油探勘基地上举办舞会已经好几次了，在室内举行，还是第一次。刚吃完晚饭，人们就在下午刚赶装起来的灯头上安起一个个五百支光的灯泡。很早就来到舞场的人们有些和自己的好朋友谈一星期来的工作情况；有的忙着预约舞伴；性急的人干脆就口哼着舞曲先跳起来了。
    八点钟的时候，房子里挤满了人。乐队奏起了优美的舞曲，一对哈萨克族的实习钳工首先起舞，一对建筑工人也跟着跳起来。这时，又来了一个留着“夏伯阳”式胡子的人，从他的风尘仆仆的装束上一看就知道是从游动在野外的地质探勘队里来的。他一进门就嚷道：“嘿！这下子总得好好跳一下了！”一边嚷一边就邀请了一个舞伴，成为第三对起舞者。双双对对的人们都随着音乐旋转起来了。
    舞场的地面仍然是一片戈壁，寒冷使跳舞的人仍然穿着毡靴，跳起来真是费劲，但却丝毫没有因此而减低人们的舞兴。两、三场以后，拥挤的舞池已经使人无法施展舞步；舞会的主持人不得不提出一个要求：大家循着同一的方向旋转。
    柴达木夜晚的气温下降到摄氏零下二十多度，舞会还是在进行着。人们把夜晚的寒冷也忘却了，越来越浓的舞兴驱走了一周来紧张工作的疲劳。
