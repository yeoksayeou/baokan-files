Blind, Deaf and Mute Education and Writing Reform

Director of the Department of Blind, Deaf and Mute Education, Ministry of Education, Huang Nai

Although the National Writing Reform Conference did not include alphabetization on the agenda, the speeches of many representatives reflected the desire to achieve alphabetization as soon as possible. Promoting Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation as the standard is a practical step towards a phonetic script under the fundamental policy of reforming Chinese characters, and promoting Putonghua is preparing the conditions for alphabetization. The obstacles encountered in blind, deaf and mute education are first and foremost the obstacles of Chinese characters, and secondly the obstacles of dialectal differences. Therefore, the early realization of alphabetization will be of great benefit to blind, deaf and mute education.

Now, let's talk about the relationship between blind education and writing reform. It is impossible for blind people to learn Chinese characters. Even if the characters are carved very large, blind people can only feel the strokes of simple characters like "one, two, three, big, small, king." It is even more impossible to write them. Blind people rely on raised dot symbols punched on thick paper to read. Each symbol unit has a maximum of six dots, which can only produce sixty-three different shapes, and cannot be used to write Chinese characters at all. The earliest Chinese Braille used the principle of the telegraph code, using the combination of two Braille symbols to replace numbers. According to the order of the "Kangxi Dictionary," more than four hundred representative characters of Beijing pronunciation were arranged in sequence, and the positional changes in the writing could indicate the four tones of the characters. It takes two years to initially master this Braille, to be able to write and read. Later, foreign missionaries used a phonetic method, based on Nanjing pronunciation, to create a set of Braille letters, using a consonant and a vowel to spell a character. Later, Braille schools added tone symbols, using three Braille symbols to write a character (in dialect areas, there are also so-called Cantonese Braille and Fujian Braille). It takes half a year to a year to learn this Braille, to be able to write and read initially.

Neither of the above two types of Braille have broken free from the shackles of Chinese characters, and have not adopted the method of writing words together. Like Chinese characters, they are written in a continuous string, which often leads to unclear meanings. When I first corresponded with blind people using the old Braille, I found that most of them did not write very fluently. After careful study, I realized that it was the obstacle of Chinese characters.

The huge influence of Chinese characters on Braille is also reflected in the advocacy of Braille reform. Echoing the new pictophonetic characters of Chinese characters, some blind people advocate adding meaning symbols to the phonetic symbols, that is, using a special symbol to represent the metal radical, the stone radical, the three-dot water radical, the clothing radical, the wood radical… They think this can avoid the ambiguity of the meaning of the characters. In addition, some blind people simply advocate that each Chinese character should be replaced by a special symbol combination form, so that Braille and Chinese characters are completely "consistent." Of course, these ideas are unrealistic fantasies. However, it can also be seen from here that the traditional power of Chinese characters is deeply rooted.

Beginning in 1952, I worked with blind people to develop a new Braille, based on Beijing pronunciation as the standard, using fifty-two letters, requiring at most two phonetic symbols; at the same time, we adopted the method of writing words together, and also used tone symbols to distinguish homonyms. Technically, it is much simpler than the old Braille. It takes at most half a year to master this new Braille, to be able to write and read. Blind people naturally master vocabulary and understand grammatical relationships in learning, and their language proficiency improves quickly. But we still have difficulties, and this difficulty is the contradiction between Chinese characters and phonetic writing.

The vast majority of our Braille books are translated from Chinese characters. And books written in Chinese characters are generally not very colloquial, and often contain many words converted from classical Chinese. These classical Chinese words are not easily understood by blind people at once. Blind people need dictionaries, but currently there are only Chinese character dictionaries; even if there are dictionaries, they are based on single characters, and translating them into Braille does not apply. Blind people need to learn grammar, but there is no standard grammar book at present. Most grammar books are based on the materials of Chinese characters for analysis, and cannot be fully adapted to phonetic writing. There are also problems with the transliteration of foreign names and place names. Originally, phonetic writing could be translated according to the original sound, but the names of Chinese characters are commonly used in society. If we translate "Tokyo" into "Tokio," blind people who learn it and talk to others will not be able to match up, so we still have to translate according to the transliteration of Chinese characters.

Secondly, the lack of uniformity of pronunciation also increases the difficulty for the southern dialect areas to learn the new Braille, and the phenomenon of phonetic errors cannot be completely eliminated.

Now, let's talk about the relationship between deaf and mute education and writing reform. In the past seventy years of deaf and mute education in China, the problem of teaching methods has not been solved. Until now, the main teaching method is sign language. Teaching Chinese characters with sign language has resulted in failure. Because sign language can only express some rough images and characteristics, and cannot express abstract things, many rational meanings cannot be expressed with sign language. Deaf and mute students who have attended eight years of elementary school still cannot make coherent sentences after graduation, and sentence inversion and confusion are common phenomena. For example, "Go to the cooperative to buy things" can be written as "Buy cooperative." The root cause of this phenomenon is the lack of a language foundation.

Deaf and mute children cannot speak because they are deaf and cannot hear people speak, and have not learned to speak. The modern teaching method is oralism: on the one hand, training deaf and mute children to be able to understand the meaning of language by watching the speaker's mouth movements; on the other hand, teaching them the alphabet and teaching them to pronounce and speak. After they have a language foundation, they can master writing. The delegation of the Yugoslav Deaf Association, which recently left Beijing and returned to their country, were all deaf people, and they could completely understand their national language from the translator's mouth movements; they themselves could also speak very clearly, without using sign language at all.

Oral teaching is more convenient in countries that use phonetic writing. Soviet deaf people also use finger spelling (that is, using finger movements to spell letters). But deaf people in our country have to learn Chinese characters, and Chinese characters cannot be spelled out with fingers, which adds a heavy learning burden to deaf and mute children. Although we have begun to experiment with new oral methods, using phonetic symbols as a literacy tool, and spelling words and writing sentences by writing words together, deaf and mute children must also learn Chinese characters when Chinese characters are still used by the majority of people. The divergence of dialects also increases the difficulty of oralism. Students in dialect areas learn Putonghua in school, but when they go home, their families speak a different language, and the mouth shapes are completely different, making it difficult to consolidate the learned language. This actual situation has made us hesitate about whether to use dialect teaching. If everyone speaks Putonghua, this problem will not exist. Deaf people who are older and whose speech organs have become stiff cannot learn to speak, so eliminating illiteracy among deaf people is a big problem. If there were a phonetic script, they would be able to use finger spelling to learn writing.

Therefore, blind, deaf and mute people will welcome writing reform and eagerly await the early introduction of an alphabetization plan.

Regarding the effect of phonetic writing on teaching, I can provide the following materials.

In mid-April of this year, we conducted a test on the reading and dictation abilities of two classes of first-grade children at the Shanghai Municipal School for the Blind. These two classes of students began experimenting with new methods of teaching letters in the autumn of this year. Based on the principle of gradually developing the tactile sense of blind children, we arranged the letters analytically and synthetically, and learned phonetics, words, sentences, and even short articles while teaching letters. After two months of literacy, students can read the text without hesitation, without having to identify letters and spell them out.

It is not difficult for children to learn Putonghua. As long as the teacher speaks Putonghua well, the students will learn well. We saw that the teachers of these two classes, one from Hunan and one from northern Jiangsu, worked very hard to learn Putonghua. Although they did not speak it standardly enough, it was passable. Under their guidance, children were able to automatically spell and read the four tones of phonetic characters three weeks after starting classes, without the teacher leading them to read. In the classroom, children have begun to get used to answering the teacher's questions in Putonghua. The results of our test are as follows:

Tactile reading:

Class A had thirteen students, ranging in age from twelve to fourteen. The tactile reading material was a Soviet children's story, which contained many new words and was equivalent to the extracurricular reading material of the third grade. The teacher read it aloud once, and then the students took turns reading it paragraph by paragraph, using a stopwatch to calculate the time (the number of words is calculated in Chinese characters). They read an average of thirty-three words per minute, the fastest read sixty-nine words, and the slowest read thirty words.

Class B also had thirteen students, ranging in age from seven to twelve. The tactile reading material was a text that had not been taught in the second volume of the Chinese language textbook, and there were no new words. The test results showed that they read an average of one hundred and twenty words per minute, the fastest read one hundred and forty-three words, and the slowest read forty-eight words.

The dictation test was conducted individually. Due to insufficient time, a total of eighteen people were tested in both classes, including those who wrote quickly, those who wrote slowly, and those who wrote moderately. The dictation material was the same, which was a text that had not been taught in the back of the second volume of the Chinese language textbook. The test results showed that they wrote an average of twenty-one words per minute, the fastest wrote thirty-five words, and the slowest wrote eighteen words. The errors in the test results, including wrong characters, missing characters, phonetic errors, reversed letters, etc., accounted for only 1.2%.

We do not have accurate test materials on the teaching effect of the new Braille on adult blind people. But based on the information obtained from communicating with individual blind revolutionary disabled soldiers, it is roughly as follows: Blind revolutionary disabled soldiers who had no culture in the past can write wall newspapers and clapper talks of seven or eight hundred words after half a year to eight months of study. Those who had read books for one or two years in the past made particularly rapid progress. After eight months, they could write articles of two or three thousand words and had them published in newspapers and broadcasts. I once received a letter from a blind revolutionary disabled soldier in Guangdong, in which he described in detail his arduous learning process. He only had two fingers left and only knew more than a hundred Chinese characters in the past, but after four months of hard study, his Braille letter was written relatively smoothly and fluently, with only a few word division and phonetic errors.

Although Braille has its characteristics, the advantages of phonetic writing can be affirmed from the above materials. It is much more effective to use it for primary school education and to eliminate illiteracy than Chinese characters.

A major step in realizing phonetic writing is to promote Putonghua. This is a broad mass movement, and efforts must be made to publicize it from all aspects to form a upsurge, so that everyone will actively promote Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation as the standard, and prepare the necessary conditions for the fundamental reform of writing—the alphabetization of Chinese.

    盲聋哑教育和文字改革
    教育部盲聋哑教育处处长　黄乃
    全国文字改革会议虽然没有把拼音化列入议程，但是许多代表的发言都反映了早日实现拼音化的要求，而推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话，正是在根本改革汉字的方针下过渡到拼音文字的实际步骤，推广普通话正是为拼音化准备条件。盲聋哑教育所遭遇的障碍，首先就是汉字的障碍；其次是各地方言分歧的障碍，所以早日实现拼音化，对于盲聋哑教育将是莫大的利益。
    现在，先谈盲人教育和文字改革的关系。盲人学习汉字是没有可能的。把汉字刻得大大的，盲人顶多也只能摸清像“一、二、三、大、小、王”等笔画简单的汉字。要写，就更没有可能了。盲人的学习，是依靠在厚纸上锥出的凸点符号来摸读的，每一个符号单位，最多不超过六点，只能变出六十三种不同的形状，根本不能用它来写汉字。中国最早的盲字，是利用电码的原理，用两个盲字符号的组合来代替数码；根据“康熙字典”的次序，把北京音的四百多个代表字依次编排出来，并且利用写法上的位置变换，可以表明字的四声。初步掌握这种盲字，能写、能读，要学两年工夫。后来，外国传教士用拼音的方式，根据南京语音制定了一套盲文字母，用一个声母和一个韵母拼成一个字；以后，盲童学校里又添加声调符号，用三个盲字符号写一个字（在方言区，还有所谓广东盲字和福建盲字）。学习这种盲字，初步能写、能读，要花半年到一年的工夫。
    以上两种盲字，都没有摆脱汉字的束缚，没有采取词儿连写的方法，像汉字一样，一连串地写下去，这就常有字义不清的毛病。我起初用旧盲字和盲人通信，发现他们多半写得不很通顺，仔细研究后，才知道是汉字的阻碍。
    汉字对盲字的巨大影响，还表现在盲字改革的主张上。同汉字的新形声字相呼应，有些盲人主张在拼音之外再增添意符，就是用某个特别符号代表金旁、石旁、三点水、衣旁、木旁……。他们以为这样就可避免字义的含混。此外，还有一些盲人干脆主张每一个汉字都用一个特殊的符号组合形式来代替，使盲字和汉字完全“一致”。当然这些想法是不切实际的空想。不过，从这里也可以看出汉字的传统力量的根深柢固。
    从一九五二年开始，我同盲人一起研究，搞出来一套新盲字，以北京语音为标准，用五十二个字母、顶多只需两拼；同时采取词儿连写的方法，也用声调符号来区别同音词。在技术上，比旧盲字大为简单化了。掌握这种新盲字，能写，能读，顶多只需半年工夫。盲人在学习中自然地掌握词汇，领会语法关系，语文水平就很快地提高了。可是我们还有困难，这个困难就是汉字和拼音文字之间的矛盾。
    我们的盲文书籍，绝大多数是从汉字翻译出来的。而用汉字写的书，一般都是不大口语化的，并且常常夹用许多从文言转来的字眼。这些文言词，盲人不容易一下子就领会。盲人群众要求词典，可是目前只有汉字的字典；纵或有词典，也是以单字为基础的，照翻成盲文，又不适用。盲人要学语法，但目前还没有标准的语法书，一般语法书，多半都是根据汉字的材料来分析的，同拼音文字不能完全适应。外国人名、地名的译音也有问题。本来，拼音文字满可以照原音译出，可是社会上通用的是汉字的名称。我们如果把“东京”翻成“Tokio”，盲人学了去和别人交谈，两下就对不上头，所以我们现在仍只得根据汉字的译音转译。
    其次，语音的不统一，也增加了南方方言区学习新盲字的困难，一般还不能完全消灭拼音错误的现象。
    现在，再来谈谈聋哑教育和文字改革的关系。我国过去七十多年的聋哑教育，没有解决教学手段的问题。直到现在为止，主要的教学方法是比手势。用手势教汉字，结果是失败的。因为手势只能表示一些粗略的形象和特征，不能表示抽象的东西，许多讲道理的意思打不出手势来。聋哑学生上了八年的小学，毕业后造句还是不通，语句颠倒错乱是普遍的现象。譬如说，“上合作社去买东西”，竟会被写成“买合作社”。造成这种现象的根本原因，就是缺乏语言的基础。
    聋哑儿童不会说话，是由于耳聋听不到人说，才没有学会说话。现代的教学方法，是口语法：一方面训练聋哑儿童能够看说话者的口形，了解语言的意思；另一方面，又教给字母，教他们发音说话。他们有了语言基础之后，就能够掌握文字了。最近离开北京返国的南斯拉夫聋人协会代表团，他们都是聋人，都完全可以从翻译的口形，看懂他们的民族语言；他们自己也能很清晰地说话，完全不用打手势。
    口语法的教学，在使用拼音文字的国家，比较方便。苏联聋人还应用指语（就是用手指的动作打字母）。可是我国聋人却要学汉字，汉字又不能用手指打出来，这就给聋哑儿童添上了沉重的学习负担。虽然我们已在开始实验新的口语法，用注音字母作识字的工具，按词儿连写的方法来拼词，写句子，可是当汉字还被多数人使用的时候，聋哑儿童也得学会汉字。方言的分歧，也增加了口语法的困难。方言区域的学生，从学校里学了普通话，回家以后，家里人说的是另一种话，口形完全不同，学会的语言不易巩固。这种实际情形，曾使我们对于是否使用方言教学的问题表现踌躇。如果大家都说普通话，这个问题就不存在了。年龄较大的聋人，发音器官已经僵化，不可能学会说话，这样，扫除聋人中的文盲就很成问题。假使有了拼音文字，他们就能够使用指语来学习文字。
    所以，盲聋哑人一定会欢迎文字改革，迫切地等待着早日提出拼音化方案来。
    关于拼音文字在教学上的效果，我可以提供以下的材料。
    今年四月中，我们在上海市盲童学校一年级的两班儿童中，作了一个测验，测验他们的摸读能力和听写能力。这两班学生，在本年秋季开始实验用新的方法教学字母。我们根据逐渐发展盲童触觉的原则，既分析、又综合地安排了字母，在教字母的同时又学拼音和词句乃至短文。学生经两个月的识字阶段以后，就能不迟疑地读出课文来，毋须再辨认字母去拼音。
    小孩学普通话是不大困难的，只要教师的普通话说得好一些，学生就会学得好一些。我们看到这两班的教师，一位是湖南人，一位是苏北人，由于她们很刻苦地学习普通话，虽然说得还不够标准，但也过得去。儿童在她们教导之下，在开始上课三周后，毋须老师领读，就能自动拼音，并能读出拼音字的四声来。在课堂上，孩子们已经开始习惯用普通话回答老师的问题了。我们测验的结果是这样的：
    摸读方面：
    甲班十三人，从十二岁到十四岁。摸读材料是一篇苏联的儿童故事，里面有不少生词，相当三年级的课外读物。先由老师朗读一遍，然后由学生一段一段地轮着读，用马表计算时间（字数以汉字计算）。他们平均每分钟摸读三十三字，最快的摸读六十九字，最慢的摸读三十字。
    乙班也是十三人，由七岁到十二岁。摸读材料是语文第二册中没有教的课文，没有什么生词。测验结果，平均每分钟摸读一百二十字，最快的摸读一百四十三字，最慢的四十八字。
    听写测验是个别进行的，由于时间不够，两班共测验了十八人，其中包括写得快的、写得慢的和中等的。听写材料是相同的，就是用语文第二册后面没有教过的课文。测验结果，平均每分钟写二十一字，最快的写三十五字，最慢的写十八字。测验成绩中的错误，包括错字、漏字、拼音错、写反字母等等，只有百分之一点二。
    新盲字对成年盲人的教学效果，我们还没有精确的测验材料。但是根据同个别盲革命残废军人通信得到的情况，大体说来是这样：过去没有文化的盲革命残废军人，在经过半年到八个月的学习后，可以写七、八百字的墙报稿和快板。过去读过一两年书的，进步特别快，八个月后能写长达两三千字的文章，曾在报纸和广播上发表。我曾经收到广东一位双目失明的革命残废军人的来信，信中详细地叙述了他艰苦学习的过程。他只剩下两个手指，过去只认识百多个汉字，可是在四个月的刻苦学习后，他的盲文信已写得比较通顺、流利，只有少数分词和拼音的错误。
    虽然盲文有它的特点，但是从以上的材料看来，拼音文字的优越性是可以肯定的。用它进行小学教育和扫除文盲，比汉字要有效得多。
    实现拼音文字的一个重大步骤，就是推广普通话。这是一个广泛的群众性运动，要从各方面努力进行宣传，形成一种热潮，使大家都来积极地推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话，为实现文字的根本改革——汉语的拼音化准备必要的条件。
