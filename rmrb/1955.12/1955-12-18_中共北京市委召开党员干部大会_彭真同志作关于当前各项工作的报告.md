    CCP Beijing Municipal Committee Holds Cadre Meeting
    Comrade Peng Zhen Delivers Report on Current Work

    (Our Dispatch) The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a cadre meeting of over seven thousand people on December 16th. Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, delivered a report on current work.

    Peng Zhen first explained the Party's principles and policies regarding the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. He also provided clear explanations addressing the lack of clear understanding among some comrades within the Party regarding issues such as the redemption policy. He pointed out that Party cadres should unify their thinking, rely on workers, unite and educate capitalists, and proactively, actively, and conscientiously carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Regarding the transformation of handicrafts, he pointed out that it should be planned in conjunction with the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, arranging production as a whole, unifying the pace, and proceeding separately. After this year's rectification, Beijing's handicraft cooperatives have laid a relatively solid foundation and can develop in a planned and relatively rapid manner. Peng Zhen said that the recent agricultural cooperativization movement in the suburbs has developed very rapidly, basically achieving semi-socialist cooperation, with member households already reaching 90 percent of the total number of farm households, because existing agricultural production cooperatives have concentrated their efforts on consolidation this year and are running very well. Now we should focus on the work of consolidating cooperatives and production. In his report, Peng Zhen also discussed the issue of uniting, transforming, and cultivating senior intellectuals.

    Peng Zhen finally requested that all departments in Beijing seriously examine and overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking of being content with the status quo and lagging behind the masses, make comprehensive plans for all work, strengthen leadership, and advance the socialist construction and socialist transformation work of the capital to a new stage.

    本报讯　中国共产党北京市委员会在十二月十六日召开了七千多人的党员干部大会，北京市委第一书记彭真作了关于当前各项工作的报告。
    彭真首先说明了党关于对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的方针政策，并且针对目前党内有些同志对于赎买政策等问题认识得不够清楚的地方，作了明确的解释。他指出：党员干部要统一思想认识，依靠工人，团结、教育资本家，主动地、积极地、认真地进行资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作。关于手工业改造工作，他指出：应当同资本主义工商业的改造按行业统一规划，通盘安排生产，统一步调，分别进行。北京市手工业合作社经过今年的整顿，已经打下比较巩固的基础，可以有计划地、比较迅速地发展。彭真说，最近郊区农业合作化运动因为现有的农业生产合作社在今年集中力量进行巩固，都办得很好，发展得十分迅速，已经基本上实现了半社会主义合作化，入社农户已经达到农户总数百分之九十。现在应当抓紧整社工作和生产工作。彭真在报告中，还谈到了团结、改造和培养高级知识分子的问题。
    彭真最后要求北京市各部门认真检查和克服安于现状、落后于群众的右倾保守思想，对各项工作都作出全面规划，加强领导，把首都的社会主义建设和社会主义改造工作，推进到一个新的阶段。
