    To Develop the Aquatic Resources of the Motherland's South China Sea
    Wu Erxiang
    On the vast and fertile South China Sea fishing grounds of our motherland, a number of modernized fishing vessels have emerged. These fishing vessels belong to the state-owned South China Sea Aquatic Products Company. Since the company was established in 1953, the number of fishing vessels has increased from four to nine. This is a nascent force that will play a significant role in the development of the aquatic resources of the South China Sea.
    Abundance is the hallmark of the South China Sea. In this approximately 440,000 square nautical mile subtropical fishing ground, hundreds of species of precious aquatic life thrive, and it is estimated that this fishing ground can produce about 4.5 million tons of aquatic products annually. However, before liberation, more than 80 percent of the fishing boats operating along the coast had a load capacity of less than 100 dan (approximately 50 kg), and less than 2 percent had a load capacity of 1,000 dan. These boats could not move in light winds and were dangerous in strong winds. Therefore, only autumn and winter were peak fishing seasons. This meant that the rich South China Sea fishing grounds were not fully utilized. Currently, only 30,000 square nautical miles of the South China Sea fishing grounds are being utilized, accounting for about 7 percent of the total area. In 1954, the fish production was 270,000 tons, of which 93 percent was caught by small fishing boats in shallow waters.
    Due to the lack of any foundation in modern marine fishing production in the past, everything had to be started from scratch after liberation. For example, because there was no experience in building new-style fishing vessels, the first double-trawler vessels, Nos. 201 and 202, were built with bows that were too high, and they could not operate even in slightly stronger winds. The time the fishing vessels spent in port for repairs exceeded the time they spent at sea producing. They learned a lesson each time they went to sea and made improvements when they returned. After lowering the bows of the double-trawler vessels Nos. 201 and 202, they could operate in winds up to force six.
    Due to the lack of information on aquatic resources and unfamiliarity with the habits of fish, fishing vessels often had to run to five or six fishing grounds on each voyage, moving to another location when they came up empty. However, the staff of the South China Sea Aquatic Products Company gradually accumulated knowledge about the activity patterns of fish in the South China Sea in this way. They identified the activity ranges of various fish at different times by studying the relationship between different fish species and the seabed quality, depth, temperature, and wind and tides; and by understanding the habits of various fish. Now, they have a relatively good understanding of what fish are in which fishing grounds at what time.
    In the beginning, the South China Sea Aquatic Products Company used the nets used along the coast of East China. However, the water depth and fish activity conditions in the South China Sea were different from those along the coast of East China. Therefore, from 1954, the South China Sea Aquatic Products Company gradually improved the structure of the nets based on the preliminary understanding of the fishing ground conditions and the characteristics of the fish in the South China Sea, so that they were suitable for the characteristics of the South China Sea. The seawater in the South China Sea is deep and has a large buoyancy, so they increased the weight of the net's footrope to give the net sufficient sinking force. The fish in the South China Sea are active and swim fast, so they thinned the twine, replaced cotton twine with hemp twine, and used tung oil to dye the nets, reducing the weight of a net from 680 jin (approximately 340 kg) to 380 jin (approximately 190 kg), reducing the drag of the net and increasing the trawling speed by more than 30 percent.
    Every time the fishing vessels returned from a voyage, everyone summarized their work. Through the accumulation of experience, bit by bit, the offshore operation technology was gradually improved. Liang Chaosheng, the captain of the double-trawler vessel No. 202, recalled the initial situation and said, "At that time, we were not skilled in operating, and it took us more than an hour to haul in a net, so we could only cast the net two or three times a day. There were many accidents. If we were not careful, the net would get into the propeller, or the nets would get tangled with each other, and the fish would all escape. Each voyage took about 30 days, and we only caught about 10,000 jin (approximately 5,000 kg) of fish." The situation is different now. In the past, the ships had to stay in port for ten or eight days after returning, but now they generally do not stay in port for more than three days before going back to sea. There can be a pre-determined plan for going to what fishing grounds and catching what fish. The operation time at sea has increased, and the number of net casts per day has also increased. The single-trawler vessel No. 101 and the double-trawler vessels Nos. 201 and 202 averaged only 3.5 net casts per working day in the first half of last year, but this has increased to 4.2 times in the second half of the year. The maximum number of net casts per day in the first half of this year can be six. The single-trawler vessel No. 101 could only catch an average of 220 jin (approximately 110 kg) of fish per net cast in the first half of last year, but it could catch 500 jin (approximately 250 kg) in the second half of the year, and this has increased to about 600 jin (approximately 300 kg) in the first half of this year. The average yield per voyage was 4,000 jin (approximately 2,000 kg) in the first half of last year, but this has increased to 24,000 jin (approximately 12,000 kg) in the first half of this year. The average number of days per voyage has decreased from 35 days to 26 days. Last year, the total annual output of one single-trawler vessel, two double-trawler vessels, and one fishing boat only reached 267 tons, while in the first half of this year alone, the output of one single-trawler vessel and two double-trawler vessels has reached 246 tons. The South China Sea Aquatic Products Company was always losing money in the early stages of its establishment, but by April of this year, it had begun to make a small profit.
    In the early days of the establishment of the South China Sea Aquatic Products Company, except for a few crew members transferred from East China who had relatively more experience in production on new-style fishing vessels, the others had never been on new-style fishing vessels, and some had never even been to sea. But now the company has more than 170 skilled crew members. They are being assigned to the newly built fishing vessels in batches. The fishermen and fishing workers who were originally transferred from the coast had rich experience in production on old-style fishing boats, but they did not understand the operation methods of new-style fishing vessels and nets. In order to quickly master the new technology, they spent one hour each day studying culture during their intensive operations at sea. Liang Chaosheng, a fisherman with 20 years of experience in wooden boat operations, is now the captain of the double-trawler vessel No. 202. He learned to master the performance of the relatively complex net-lifting machine in just one year and became familiar with the characteristics of the new-style double-trawl net structure. Based on his past experience in fishing in the South China Sea, and in light of the characteristics of the operation of new-style fishing vessels, he constantly put forward rationalization proposals for improving the nets. Recently, he also designed a structural diagram of a net that is mainly used to catch the South China Sea's abundant nine-spined fish and other fish.
    The young students who just came out of aquatic product schools not long ago have also deeply fallen in love with ocean life. Xiao Yinlong came to the ship from school in August last year. According to him, when he first arrived on the ship, "I got seasick as soon as I got on the ship. I slept on a small bed, rocking back and forth, and all I wanted to do was throw up. When you are seasick, you have no strength in your whole body, and you can't shake two steel wires. When there are a lot of fish, we have to cast the net at night, and we can only try to sleep for one or two hours during the intervals between casting and hauling the net. I thought of those classmates who were assigned to work on merchant ships, and I thought that it must be very comfortable to live and work on those wide and large merchant ships, and at this time I was a little shaken. But I also thought that I was studying fishing, and I saw that we could haul up thousands of jin of fish in two hours with one net cast. There are plenty of fish in the South China Sea, but we have so few boats. The country needs more and more aquatic product cadres, and it needs us to create experience so that we can develop the aquatic resources of the South China Sea on a larger scale in the future and support the country's industrial construction. Thinking of this, I strengthened my determination: I must develop the South China Sea!" Since last year, he has been to sea eleven times and has become accustomed to life on the ship. In the face of a force-six gale, when the sky is pitch black and the sea is white, and all you can hear is the wind howling, and a wave washes over, sweeping the people on the ship more than a zhang (approximately 3.3 meters) away, he is still busily fishing with those old fishing workers. He feels an unprecedented satisfaction when he looks at those jumping fish piled on the ship. Xiao Yinlong started as a fishing worker on the double-trawler vessel No. 202 and has now been transferred to the newly built double-trawler vessel No. 304. "Now the task is even heavier, and we must do a good job." He said with full confidence.
    "Although we have achieved some results in the past two years, this is only a beginning." Feng Shunlou, the chief captain of the state-owned South China Sea Aquatic Products Company, said to me after introducing the company's development over the past two years: "The work we have done is still far from the requirements of the state. In order to develop the resources of the South China Sea, we still have a lot of work to do. We must learn from the Soviet Union, and we must also learn from fraternal companies."
    "We don't have many fishing vessels now," he added, "but our fishing vessels will increase rapidly. In order to meet the needs of the development of the South China Sea fisheries, we are building the first modern fisheries base in South China in Xinzhou, Guangzhou. Next year, our fishing vessels will be able to dock at this base's wharf to unload fish, load ice, refuel, and equip themselves with the supplies needed for going to sea. Therefore, it will be possible to ensure that the fishing vessels do not stay in port for more than 48 hours next year. We plan to expand the fishing ground area by 50 percent compared to the current area next year, and the total output of fish will reach 5,000 tons."

    为了开发祖国南海的水产资源
    吴尔祥
    在辽阔、富饶的祖国南海渔场上，已经出现了一批现代化的渔轮。这些渔轮是属于国营南海水产公司的。从一九五三年公司成立到现在，渔轮已经由四艘增加到九艘。这是一支新生的力量，它将在开发祖国南海水产资源的事业上发挥巨大的作用。
    富饶是南海的特点。在这大约四十四万多平方浬的亚热带的渔场上，繁殖着几百种珍贵的水族，估计这个渔场每年可产水产品四百五十万吨左右。但是在解放前，在沿海作业的渔船中，百分之八十以上是载重一百担以下的，载重一千担的还不到百分之二。这种船，风小了拖不动，风大了又有危险。因此，只有秋冬才是捕鱼的旺季。这就使得富饶的南海渔场得不到充分的利用。目前已利用的南海渔场只有三万平方浬，约占南海总渔场面积百分之七。一九五四年鱼产量是二十七万吨，其中由小渔船在浅海捕获的占百分之九十三。
    由于过去在现代化海洋渔捞生产方面毫无基础，解放后，一切都得从头做起。比如，因为过去没有建造新式渔轮的经验，初次建造的双拖二○一号和二○二号船，船头造得太高了，风稍大一点，就不能作业。渔轮停港修理的时间比出海生产的时间还多。出海一次，接受一点教训，回来改进一点。双拖二○一号和二○二号船，把船首改低后，在六级风下也可以作业了。
    由于水产资源不明，对鱼类习性不熟悉，渔轮出一次海往往得跑五、六个渔场，这里扑空了，就换个地方。但是南海水产公司的工作人员们就是这样逐渐积累了关于南海鱼类活动规律的知识。他们从研究不同的鱼类同海的底质、深度、温度、风潮等的关系中；从认识各种鱼类的习性中，找出各种鱼在不同时期的活动范围。现在，什么渔场在什么时候有什么鱼，他们已经比较心中有数了。
    开始的时候，南海水产公司采用华东沿海所使用的网具。但是南海的海水深度和鱼类活动情况都和华东沿海的情况不同。因此，从一九五四年开始，南海水产公司便根据初步了解的渔场情况和南海鱼类的特性，逐步地改进网具的构造，使它适合于南海的特点。南海的海水深，上浮力大，他们就把网具的沉网加重，使网具有足够的沉降力。南海的鱼类活动力强，游得快，他们就把网线改细，把棉线改用麻线，染网改用桐油，使一张网的重量由六百八十斤减少到三百八十斤，减少了网具的拖行阻力，使拖行速度提高了百分之三十以上。
    渔轮每出一次海回来，大家就总结一次工作，经过一点一滴的积累经验，慢慢地就提高了海上作业技术。双拖二○二号船长梁朝胜想起初期的情况说：“那个时候，我们操作又不熟练，起一次网就得一个多钟头，一天只能投二、三次网。事故特别多，一不小心，网就打进车叶里去，或网具互相绞缠，这样一来鱼跑光了。出一次海要三十天左右，只捕一万来斤的鱼。”现在情况已经不同了。过去各船回港要留上十天、八天，现在回港一般不超过三天又出海了。出海到什么渔场，捕什么鱼，都可以有预定的计划。海上的作业时间增加了，每天投网次数也增加了。单拖一○一号船和双拖二○一号、二○二号船，去年上半年平均每个工作日只投网三点五次，下半年已经提高到四点二次，今年上半年最多的一天可以投六次网。单拖一○一号船，去年上半年平均下一次网只能捕鱼二百二十斤，下半年就能捕到五百斤，今年上半年又提高到六百斤左右。去年上半年每次出海的平均产量是四千斤，今年上半年又提高到二万四千斤。而航次平均天数却从三十五天减到二十六天。去年一艘单拖船、两艘双拖船和一艘钓船的全年总产量只达二百六十七吨，而今年上半年，仅一艘单拖和两艘双拖的产量就已达到了二百四十六吨。南海水产公司在创办后的一个时期内老是亏本，到今年四月份，已经开始有少许的利润了。
    在南海水产公司成立的初期，除了从华东调来的几个船员是比较有在新式渔轮上生产的经验外，其他都是从来没有上过新式渔轮的，甚至还有没有出过海的。但是现在公司已经有一百七十多个技术熟练的船员了。他们正一批一批地被分配到新建造的渔船上去。原来从沿海调来的渔工、渔民，都有丰富的在旧式渔船生产的经验，可是不懂新式渔轮和网具的操作方法。为了能够很快掌握新的技术，他们在海上的紧张作业中，每天都抽出一小时学习文化。有二十年木船作业经验的渔民梁朝胜，现在当上了双拖二○二号船长。他只一年时间就学会了掌握比较复杂的起网机的性能，熟悉了新式双拖网具构造的特点。他根据自己过去在南海捕鱼的经验，针对新式渔轮操作的特点，不断提出改进网具的合理化建议。最近他还设计了一个以南海大宗的九棍鱼等为主要鱼捞对象的网具构造图样。
    不久前才从水产学校出来的青年学生们，现在也深深地爱上了海洋生活。萧寅龙是去年八月才从学校到船上来的。刚到船上的时候，照他的话说：“一上船就晕，睡在一张小床上，摇来摇去，光想吐。一晕船全身没有力气，摇两条钢丝后就再摇不动了。鱼多的时候，晚上也下网，只能争取在放网起网的间隙时间睡一、二小时。我想起那些被分配到商船上工作的同学，在又宽又大的商船上生活和工作一定很舒服，这时自己就有些动摇了。但是我又想到自己学的是鱼捞科，又看到我们下一次网，两个小时就能拉起几千斤的鱼。南海的鱼有的是，我们的船却那么少。国家正需要越来越多的水产干部，需要我们创造经验，以便将来更大规模地开发南海的水产资源，支援国家工业建设。想到这里，我就坚定了自己的决心：一定要把南海开发起来！”从去年到现在，他已经出了十一次海，并且也习惯了船上的生活。在六级的大风下，天是漆黑的，海是白的，只听到风在吼叫，一个浪头打过来，把船上的人冲走一丈多远；但是他仍然和那些老渔工出身的鱼捞员们在一起紧张地捕鱼。他看着那些堆放在船上的还在跳跃的鱼，感到从未有过的满足。萧寅龙开始是在双拖二○二号船上当鱼捞员，现在被调到新造的双拖三○四号船来了。“现在任务更加重了，更要好好地干。”他充满信心地说。
    “虽然我们在这两年来获得了一些成绩，但是这只是一个开端。”国营南海水产公司总船长冯顺楼向我介绍了公司两年来的发展情况后说：“我们所做的工作距离国家的要求还很远，为了开发南海资源，我们还要做很多的工作；我们要向苏联学习，也要向兄弟公司学习。”
    “现在我们的渔轮还不多，”他又说：“但是我们的渔轮会很快增加。为了适应南海渔业发展的需要，我们正在广州市新洲建立一个华南第一个现代化的渔业基地。明年我们的渔轮就可以停泊在这个基地码头上卸鱼、装冰、加油和配备出海所需要的物资。因此，明年就有可能使渔轮停港的时间不超过四十八小时。我们计划明年渔场面积要比现在扩大百分之五十，鱼类的总产量要达到五千吨。”
