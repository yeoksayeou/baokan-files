Investigation Report from the Zhangjiakou Daily Editorial Department (Summary)

    The cultural and recreational activities of the employees of the Longyan Iron Mine were once very active in 1952 and the first half of 1953. The workers organized some cultural and recreational activity groups, which performed frequently and played a significant role in promoting production and enriching the workers' spare time. However, due to the leadership's abandonment of leadership and lack of support for this work, these groups collapsed soon after.

    Currently, although the Longyan Iron Mine has a workers' club that screens movies approximately every two days (on a commercial basis), as readers have reflected, most workers rarely come here to watch movies because the mines are far apart. In addition, there are four cultural centers with playing cards, various chess pieces, and other toys; however, the space is too small, accommodating only a dozen or so people each time, which cannot meet the workers' demands. To carry out sports activities, workers in the East No. 1 District once built a basketball court with their own hands; however, the mine built some houses on both sides of the basketball court, so the workers could no longer play basketball. Although the general factory's trade union once spent a lot of money to buy musical instruments, these instruments had to be put into storage because no one was leading this work.

    This situation has created very bad consequences. For example, the Pangjiabao East No. 3 District is a concentrated residence for single employees (with more than 1,000 workers). There were only two cultural and recreational performances and one movie screening here in the first half of this year; therefore, the workers feel very depressed in their spare time, and some individual workers read absurd, obscene, and reactionary novels; some people gamble by playing "poker." In addition, storytellers in Pangjiabao have also increased because the workers love to listen to them; however, the content of their stories is outdated and spreads some low-taste things.

    We believe that the Party organization, administrative leaders, and trade union of the Longyan Iron Mine should pay attention to the demands of the workers and quickly lead the workers to carry out cultural and recreational activities.

    张家口日报编辑部的调查报告（摘要）
    龙烟铁矿职工的文化娱乐活动，在一九五二年和一九五三年上半年曾经搞得很活跃。工人们组织了一些文娱活动单位，经常演出，对推动生产和丰富工人业余生活都起了很大的作用。但是，由于领导方面对这项工作放弃领导，不加支持，不久以后这些单位都垮台了。
    目前龙烟铁矿虽然有一个工人俱乐部，大约每两天放映电影一次（系营业性质）；但正如读者反映的，由于各矿相距很远，大部分工人很少到这里来看电影。另外有四个文化馆，里面有扑克、各种棋子等玩具；但是地方太小，每次只能容纳十多个人，不能满足工人的要求。工人们为了开展体育活动，在东一区曾经自己动手修建了一个篮球场；但是矿上却在篮球场的两边盖上了一些房子，工人们就没法打球了。总厂工会虽然曾经花了不少钱买来乐器，但是因为没有人领导这项工作，这些乐器也就只好放进了仓库。
    这种状况造成了很不好的后果。例如，庞家堡东三区是独身职工集中居住的地方（有一千多名工人），这里今年上半年只有过两天的文娱演出，放映过一次电影；因此工人们在业余时间都感到很苦闷，个别工人就看荒诞、淫秽和反动的小说；有些人就打“扑克”进行赌博。另外，庞家堡说书的艺人也因为职工爱听而多起来了；但是他们所说的书内容陈旧，而且还散布一些低级趣味的东西。
    我们认为，龙烟铁矿的党组织、行政领导和工会应该重视工人群众的要求，迅速领导工人把文娱活动开展起来。
