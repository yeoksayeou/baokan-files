    Response to Criticism from This Newspaper

    On October 28th, this newspaper published an article titled "A 'Public-Private Partnership' Enterprise That Harms the Public for Private Gain," exposing the illegal activities of capitalists at the Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture Civilian Pharmaceutical Factory, criticizing the right-leaning paralysis of Gao Qianghua, the secretary of the CCP Civilian Pharmaceutical Factory Branch, and Han Baotang, the public representative, and criticizing the right-leaning ideology of the leadership of the Shanghai First Light Industry Committee of the CCP. Now, the Shanghai First Light Industry Committee of the CCP, Gao Qianghua, and Han Baotang have sent letters of self-criticism and have proposed preliminary measures to correct their mistakes.

    In its letter, the Shanghai First Light Industry Party Committee stated that, in order to learn from this lesson and improve their work, in addition to ordering Gao Qianghua, the secretary of the Public-Private Joint Venture Civilian Pharmaceutical Factory Branch, and Han Baotang, the general manager, to further self-criticize, they will conduct a comprehensive and in-depth review and education among all Party members and employees of the Civilian Pharmaceutical Factory, as well as in the various public-private joint venture enterprises under their leadership, to criticize right-leaning thoughts in the implementation of policies; in the state-owned enterprises under their jurisdiction, they will conduct a general review and criticism of capitalist management ideas to raise the class consciousness of Party members and employees. They will formulate a comprehensive plan to strengthen the political and ideological education of Party members and employees, in response to the weak political and ideological work of the Party in enterprises and the low policy level of staff. For Gao Qianghua and Han Baotang, in addition to continuing education and severe criticism, they will be given serious punishment based on the extent of their self-criticism and correction of errors.

    对本报批评的反应
    十月二十八日本报发表了“一个损公利私的‘公私合营’企业”一文，揭发了上海市公私合营民用药厂资本家的不法行为，批评了中共民用药厂支部书记高强华和公股代表韩保棠的右倾麻痹思想，批评了中共上海市第一轻工业委员会领导思想的右倾。现在，中共上海市第一轻工业委员会、高强华和韩保棠已经来信检讨，并且提出了纠正错误的初步措施。
    上海市第一轻工业党委在来信中说，为了接受这一教训，改进工作，除了责成公私合营民用药厂支部书记高强华和总经理韩保棠进一步检讨外，在民用药厂全体党员和职工中，以及在所领导的各公私合营企业中进行全面深入的检查和教育，批判在执行政策中的右倾思想；在所属国营企业中，普遍检查和批判资本主义经营思想，提高党员和职工的阶级觉悟。他们将针对企业中党的政治思想工作薄弱、工作人员政策水平不高的情况，做出全面加强党员和职工政治思想教育工作的计划。对于高强华和韩保棠，除继续进行教育和严厉批评以外，并且将根据他们检讨和改正错误的程度，予以严肃的处理。
