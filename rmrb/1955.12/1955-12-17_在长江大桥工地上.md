At the Yangtze River Bridge Construction Site
By our reporter Cao Baoming

The unruly river water has receded. Thousands upon thousands of construction workers gathered at Tortoise Hill and Snake Hill, launching a full-scale attack on the Yangtze River. They aim to advance the bridge project from the riverbank to the river's heart during this first dry season since the bridge's commencement, simultaneously working on six piers; to raise piers one and two above the water's surface; and to lay the Beijing-Hankou Railway across the Han River to the bridgehead at Tortoise Hill.

The construction site is a hive of activity. Everywhere you look, you can see various cranes and crane ships wielding their steel arms, and everywhere you hear the roar of various machines in operation. The heavy hammering of the thirty-meter-high universal pile driver adds a rhythmic melody to this chorus of sounds. On piers one and two, where workers persevered throughout the flood season, four more large drilling rigs have been added. The impact beams of the drilling rigs, clad in raincoats, resemble the necks of tethered camels swaying up and down from a distance, as the three-ton drill bit relentlessly pounds the bedrock beneath the river day and night. At pier eight in front of Yellow Crane Tower, the cofferdams and casings have been sunk, and seamless steel sheet piles tightly wrap around the cofferdams. Workers are preparing to pour underwater concrete. On pier five, located in the heart of the river, workers are assembling the third layer of cofferdam. Passengers crossing the river can see the white arc lights flashing above it at any time.

On the water, you only see machines turning, not many workers. It's different on the land routes, where lines of resilient carrying poles sway in unison, carried by earth movers, and where nimble wheelbarrow operators glide along light railways. Tractors with spiky iron rollers compact the newly built roadbed. The two or three hundred earth and timber barges densely navigating Moon Lake look like flocks of ducks in the rice paddies of southern autumn from afar.

When we first arrived at the construction site, we were very excited. In the past, the longest steel sheet piles used in bridge construction in our country were twelve meters long. Now, we are using eighteen-meter-long piles, which must be spliced together. In the past, the largest drilling rig used in our mines could drill holes half a meter in diameter. Now, the drilling rigs we are using can drill holes almost one meter in diameter and have been modified to drill holes 1.3 meters in diameter.

An official from the Engineering Bureau told us:
“Although our bureau's employees have built railway and highway bridges over the Han River, none of us has ever worked on or even seen such a large project on the Yangtze River. Dealing with such a project presents each employee with certain difficulties. In particular, the riverbed conditions are different at each pier of the Yangtze River Bridge: some have a very thick overburden layer (a layer of mud and sand covering the riverbed), while others have none; some overburden layers only change on the surface, while others change completely. Almost every pier requires different working methods. This makes construction more complex and arduous!"

To ensure the completion of the Yangtze River Bridge within the timeframe stipulated by the state, they are seizing this favorable season for water-based construction and have comprehensively launched the project ahead of schedule. They aim to further understand the situation, train the workforce, and accelerate the project's progress through large-scale construction. As early as two months ago, the Engineering Bureau, under the guidance of Soviet experts, arranged various work plans to connect each project and each type of work together. They also formulated seven technical and organizational measures to address the difficulties encountered in the construction. A team of materials personnel, led by a deputy director, went to Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenyang to expedite the delivery of various machines and materials. Technical personnel, led by the chief engineer, worked day and night to produce drawings and deliver detailed technical designs in a timely manner before the start of each project. Soviet friends not only proposed the latest construction methods for the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge, but also stayed on the construction site day and night, helping to solve every specific problem in the construction.

A wave of labor emulation has been set off on the construction site. From the water to the land, from the Yellow Crane Tower on Snake Hill to the Qingchuan Pavilion on Tortoise Hill, good news is constantly being reported. Various construction sites are continuously creating new work achievements, breaking planned targets, and accelerating the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge.

As soon as the labor emulation began, the two small red flags on pier one kept rotating among the six drilling teams, and no one could keep them. This is because each team was breaking planned targets and creating new drilling achievements.

We climbed onto the work platform of pier one. Looking down from the platform, the group of casings standing in the river resembled dozens of huge, deep wells. Two drilling rigs were in operation, with only four people on duty beside each machine. The others were doing other preparatory work. A team leader on duty explained the drilling process to us.

This team leader's name is Dai Bochun, and he is only twenty-two years old this year. He was transferred from the Xiangjiang Bridge at the beginning of last year. He joined the Communist Youth League and then the Communist Party during the construction of the Han River Railway Bridge, and attended the Hubei Provincial Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction. Before June of this year, he was still a rigging worker. I had heard some stories about him in the rigging team long ago. Once, when a casing was being sunk at pier two, a violent storm hit just as two sections of the casing had been connected. The huge waves crashing against the casing roared heart-stoppingly, and the strong wind made it difficult to stand. Yet, this brave young man climbed to the top of the ten-meter-high casing and persevered in high-altitude work for more than three hours amidst the storm, successfully completing the task.

At the end of July, the Engineering Bureau drew people from various teams to train as drillers, and Dai Bochun was also drawn in. Who didn't know that such large-scale drilling was unprecedented in the whole country! He was extremely excited at the time and immediately submitted a letter of determination to the Party branch: "Guarantee to study well and complete the tasks assigned by the organization." The organization also assigned him to lead a study group.

During his studies, he listened attentively in class, and recited after class, reciting during the day, reciting at night, reciting while eating, and reciting while walking. After studying for more than thirty days, he was appointed as a team leader of a drilling rig group. At that time, he said, "In terms of theory, I don't understand the theory; in terms of operation, I'm not skilled in operation; how can I be a team leader?"

The Party branch secretary said to him: "For us Communists, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome! Look, our ancestors did not build a bridge on the Yangtze River, and we are going to build it today... The question is whether you have the determination. Do you have the determination?"

"I do! I guarantee to overcome difficulties and complete the task."

Many problems on the large drilling rig were solved by novices like Dai Bochun, so naturally there were many difficulties. But there were also engineers and Soviet experts! They overcame the difficulties encountered in drilling one by one. Initially, a drill bit needed to be repaired every twenty minutes, and sometimes it broke during drilling and fell to the bottom of the river. The first drilling rig drilled for three months without completing two holes. However, after Soviet experts and engineers modified the drill bit design, the strength of the drill bit increased seven or eight times, and one drill bit drilled twelve consecutive holes in two months. They also designed a multi-clawed "grab bucket." If anything fell into the borehole and hindered drilling, they would use this "grab bucket" to grab it. If the object that fell in was too large for the "grab bucket" to lift, divers would go down to the murky bottom of the river to salvage it.

Dai Bochun united the comrades in his team very well. Before each shift, they would observe the drilling rig's movements on the shore to understand what their team should be doing and prepare in advance. As soon as the shift started, the team leader would issue orders as to who should inspect the machine, who should control the power switch, and who should prepare the yellow mud. They would immediately start working without any delay.

The novices had difficulties in improving drilling technology, so they tried to improve auxiliary operations. They had to lift the drill bit every five decimeters of drilling. In the past, it would take more than an hour each time. Dai Bochun used his experience as a rigging worker to improve the lifting method, reducing the time to only thirty minutes per lift. In the past, it would take twenty-four hours, or even forty hours, to move a drilling rig. Foreman Fu Zhenyu devised a way to use the winch on the drilling rig to drag it, reducing the moving time to only ten hours, and as fast as eight hours.

Many teams and workers, like Dai Bochun, gradually grew up in overcoming the difficulties of low technical level. There were indeed many difficulties! As the old ones were overcome, new ones constantly emerged. Cross grooves appeared in the boreholes and needed to be solved; the cofferdam of pier five had to pass through quicksand and sink to the bedrock at the bottom of the river, and it was still difficult to predict what new situations would arise; pier eight and pier one both had to pour concrete thirty meters below the bottom of the river, which also posed new technical problems... Moving from the riverbank to the heart of the river, from partial construction to full-scale construction, there were still many difficulties in front of them.

However, difficulties cannot scare the people building the Yangtze River Bridge. With the help of Soviet experts, they are working day and night to study ways to overcome various difficulties, and to ensure the quality of the project, they are also constantly adding to the project tasks. At the Engineering Bureau's meeting to review the November plan, we witnessed firsthand their fierce attack on conservative ideas, increasing the plan for the First Bridge Team by more than double and the plan for the Second Bridge Team by seventy percent. The workers also set out competition conditions to ensure comprehensive completion, saying: We are building the Yangtze River Bridge with a socialist attitude, and we have the spirit to make "high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way!"

    在长江大桥工地上
    本报记者  曹葆铭
    不驯的江水消退了。聚集在龟山、蛇山的成千近万人的工程队伍，向长江展开了全力进攻。他们要在这大桥开工以来的第一个枯水季节里，把大桥工程从江边跃进到江心，同时在六个桥墩上施工；把一、二号桥墩修出水面；要将跨过了汉水的京汉铁路铺筑到龟山桥头。
    工地上一片繁忙景象。随处都看得见挥动钢铁臂膀的各式吊车、吊船，随处都听得见正在运行的各种机器的轰鸣。三十公尺高的万能打桩机的沉重的锤击，还给这片响声加上了音乐旋律的节奏。在洪水期间工人们始终坚持工作的一、二号桥墩上，又增添了四部大型钻机。披着雨衣的钻机的冲击梁，远望去像栓着鼻子的骆驼的脖子在上下摆动，三吨多重的钻头就随着它日夜冲击江底的岩石。黄鹤楼前的八号桥墩的围囹和管柱都下沉好了，无缝的钢板桩又严密地把围囹包扎起来，工人们正在准备浇灌水下混凝土。在位于江心的五号桥墩上，工人们正在拼接第三层围囹，过江的旅客随时都看得见上面闪动着白色的电弧光。
    在水上，只看见机器在转动，看不见多少工人。在线路上就不同了，那一行行地在一定的路线上闪动着富有弹性的扁担的是挑土工，那灵巧地随着斗车滑行在轻便铁道上的是推土工。拖拉机带着多刺的铁滚碾压新筑的路基。密密地航行在月湖里的两三百只运土木船，远远望去就像南方秋后的稻田里的鸭群。
    我们初到工地的时候，心情是很激动的。过去，我国建筑桥梁所用的钢板桩，最长的是十二公尺，现在所用的是十八公尺，还要拼接起来用。过去我国矿山上所用的钻机，最大的能钻半公尺直径的孔，现在所用的钻机却能钻将近一公尺的孔，并且被改造成为能够钻一点三公尺的钻机。
    工程局的一位负责同志告诉我们：
    “我们全局的职工，虽然建设过汉水铁路桥和公路桥，但是谁也没作过、也没见过长江上的这样大工程。要对付这样的工程，每个职工都有一定的困难。特别是长江上每个桥墩的江底情况都不一样：有的江底的覆盖层（覆在江底上的一层泥沙）很厚，有的又没有；有的覆盖层只在表面变动，有的整个都在变动。几乎对每个桥墩都要用不同的方法工作。这就使施工更复杂，更艰巨！”
    为了保证按照国家规定的期限完成长江大桥的建设，他们紧紧抓住这个水上施工的好季节，提前把工程全面铺开了。他们要在大规模施工中，进一步摸清情况，锻炼队伍，加速工程进度。早在两个月以前，工程局就在苏联专家指导下，安排了各项工作计划，使一项工程跟一项工程、一种工作跟一种工作衔接起来。他们还针对施工中的困难，作出了七项技术组织措施。以一位副局长为首的材料人员分赴北京、上海、沈阳各城市，催运各项机具、材料。以总工程师为首的技术人员日夜赶制图纸，及时地在每项工程开工以前交出详细的技术设计。苏联朋友不仅为长江大桥建设提出了最新的施工方法，并且日夜坚持在工地，随时帮助解决施工中的每一个具体问题。
    工地上掀起了劳动竞赛热潮。从水上到陆地，从蛇山的黄鹤楼到龟山的晴川阁，随时都传来捷报。各工地都不断地创造新的工作成绩，突破计划指标，加速建设长江大桥的进程。
    劳动竞赛一开始，一号桥墩的两面小红旗，就在六个钻工班里一个劲儿地转，谁也留不住它。因为各班都在突破计划指标，创造新的钻进成绩。
    我们爬上了一号桥墩的工作台。从台上俯视，屹立在江中的管柱群就像几十口巨大的深井。两部钻机正在开动，只有四个人在机旁值班，别的人都在作别的准备工作。一个当班的组长给我们讲解钻进的过程。
    这位组长叫戴伯纯，今年才二十二岁。他是去年年初从湘江大桥调来的，在汉水铁桥的建设中入了团，又入了党，出席了湖北省青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。今年六月以前他还是一名装吊工人。我早就听人讲过他在装吊班里的一些故事。一次，二号桥墩下沉管柱，刚接好了两节管柱，需要人爬到管柱顶上去安装射水管的时候，就遇上了大风浪。冲击管柱的巨浪发出了震人心弦的吼声，强劲的风吹得人站不稳脚，这个勇敢的青年却爬到十公尺高的管柱顶上去了，在大风浪里坚持了三点多钟的高空作业，顺利完成了任务。
    七月底，工程局从各班抽人去训练为钻工，把戴伯纯也被抽去了。谁不知道这样的大型钻孔在全国还是第一次呢！他当时兴奋极了，立即向支部递了个决心书：“保证学习好，完成组织分配的任务。”组织上又分配他领导一个学习小组。
    他在学习期间，上课专心听讲，下课就念，白天念，晚上念，吃饭念，走路也念。学习了三十多天，就被任命为钻机小组的一个组长了。当时，他说：“论原理，原理不懂；论操作，操作不熟；哪能当得了组长？”
    支部书记对他说：“对咱们共产党员来说，就没有什么克服不了的困难！你看，咱们祖先没有在长江上修起大桥，咱们今天就要把它修起……问题在于决心。你有决心没有？”
    “我有！我保证克服困难，完成任务。”
    大型钻机上的许多问题，都由戴伯纯这样的新手去解决，自然是困难重重。但是，还有工程师，还有苏联专家！他们把钻进中所遇到的困难一个 一个地克服了。最初，一个钻头钻二十分钟就要修理，有时就在钻进中断了，掉到江底去了。第一部钻机钻了三个月，不知换了多少钻头，还没有钻完两个孔。但是，苏联专家同工程师们把钻头设计修改以后，钻头的强度提高了七、八倍，一个钻头在两个月中就连续钻了十二个孔。他们还设计了一种多爪的“抓斗”，什么东西掉进钻孔里去了，妨碍钻进，他们就用这“抓斗”去抓上来。掉进去的是太大的物件，“抓斗”抓不动，潜水员便下到浑浊的江底去打捞。
    戴伯纯把组里的同志们团结得很好。每次上班以前，他们就在岸上观察钻机的动作，了解他们这班该做什么工作，事先做好准备。一上班，组长就发布命令，谁检查机器，谁掌握电门，谁准备黄泥，立即开始工作，一点不耽误。
    新手们要改进钻进技术有困难，他们就设法改进辅助操作。他们每钻进五公寸就要把钻头吊起来
  一次，过去一次得一个多钟头。戴伯纯运用他的装吊工的经验改进吊法，减少为吊一次只用三十分钟。过去，移动一次钻机得二十四小时，甚至四十小时，傅振玉领工员设法用钻机上的卷扬机拖，移动一次只要十来个小时，最快八小时。
    许多小组、工人都跟戴伯纯一样，是在克服技术水平低的困难中逐渐成长起来的。困难，可真是多得很啊！旧的克服了，新的又不断出现。钻孔里出现了十字槽，需要加以解决；五号桥墩的围囹要穿过流沙，下到江底岩层上去，现在还很难预测会有什么新的情况；八号桥墩和一号桥墩都要在三十公尺下的江底浇灌混凝土，也有新的技术问题……从江边进到江心，从局部动工到全面开工，还有许多困难摆在他们面前。
    但是，困难并不能吓倒建设长江大桥的人们。他们在苏联专家帮助下，一方面日夜研究克服各种困难的办法，并且保证工程的质量，一方面还不断追加工程任务。在工程局审查十一月份计划的会议上，我们亲眼看到他们向保守思想展开了激烈的攻击，把第一桥梁队的计划提高了一倍多，把第二桥梁队的计划提高了百分之七十。工人们也订出竞赛条件，保证全面完成，他们说：我们用社会主义的态度来建设长江大桥，我们有使“高山也要低头，河水也要让路”的精神！
