Distributing Income According to the Principles of Mutual Benefit and Consideration of Both Public and Private Interests
    He Cheng
    The income of an agricultural producers' cooperative is the result of everyone's labor, and naturally it should be distributed by everyone. Every member who has labored in the cooperative for a year is concerned about how the fruits of labor will be distributed, and how much they will receive. Those who have not yet joined the cooperative are most concerned about whether joining will increase their income and whether they will suffer losses.
    Appropriately Stipulating Remuneration for Means of Production
    Rest assured, the cooperative will definitely distribute income appropriately.
    In an agricultural cooperative, it is essential not to harm the interests of any poor peasant, nor the interests of any middle peasant. This applies to handling any issue within the cooperative, and even more so to the distribution of income, which affects the vital interests of every member.
    The primary principle for distributing income in a cooperative is mutual benefit, ensuring that neither poor nor middle peasants suffer losses. Generally speaking, when a cooperative is first established, middle peasants tend to have more and better means of production, while poor peasants have fewer and worse means of production. To implement the principle of mutual benefit, the most important thing is to appropriately stipulate the remuneration for land and labor, and also appropriately stipulate the remuneration for other major means of production. As long as the remuneration for labor and means of production is appropriate, both poor and middle peasants can benefit.
    After joining the cooperative, everyone works together to develop production. When production increases to a certain extent, the vast majority of members will see their income increase even without land remuneration, compared to before joining the cooperative. The cooperative will also have the strength to care for those with special difficulties, and those with only partial labor capacity will have plenty of work to do and receive considerable labor remuneration. Everyone's awareness will also be raised, and it will be possible to transition to a fully socialist advanced cooperative, adopting the most reasonable distribution method that encourages all members to actively labor, which is full remuneration according to labor. These points have already been discussed when explaining Chapters Three and Four, and will not be elaborated on further here.
    Accumulating Public Property
    In the distribution of income in an agricultural producers' cooperative, another issue of utmost concern to everyone is how public property is accumulated and how much is accumulated. This is, in effect, an important part of the question of how to correctly combine the individual interests of members with collective interests. Every year, cooperatives face the following questions during distribution: How much should be retained for the public accumulation fund and the public welfare fund?
    Some leaders and members of cooperatives lack a long-term vision and, disregarding the need to develop the collective production and cultural and welfare undertakings, only see the immediate economic interests of the members. This leads to a strange situation: the cooperative's production increases significantly, but the public accumulation fund and the public welfare fund are kept very low; members' income increases greatly thanks to collective production, but they do not care about collective interests. Some cooperatives even "distribute everything completely, leaving not a blade of grass," claiming that this makes it easier to "demonstrate the superiority of the cooperative." This is not considering both public and private interests, but rather making "the public thin and the private fat." What will be the result of doing this? It will inevitably be that the collective production and the collective cultural and welfare undertakings cannot be further developed; there is not enough strength to resist unexpected disasters, and the cooperative's production will even decrease; when members encounter unexpected difficulties, they will still be as unable to overcome them as before joining the cooperative. If the cooperative becomes "thin," the members' "fatness" will also be limited and will continue to "thin" down. Of course, it is also wrong to leave too much public accumulation fund and public welfare fund, disregarding the members' personal income and the actual needs of production, cultural, and welfare undertakings.
    Some cooperatives are also unwilling to accumulate public property because they fear that new members will benefit when the cooperative expands. They say, "We can't plant the trees for them to enjoy the shade." They advocate not keeping or keeping very little public accumulation fund, and some even advocate dividing up the past public property when expanding or merging cooperatives, and then "starting afresh with a new gong and drum" when new members join. This also leads to a strange situation: the cooperative develops and expands, but the socialist factors within the cooperative are reduced instead; the cooperative is large, but very empty, how can it exert the superiority of a large cooperative and increase production further?
    The general principles of the draft model regulations stipulate: "When distributing the fruits of labor, agricultural producers' cooperatives should reserve the necessary funds for developing production and developing public cultural and welfare undertakings, while ensuring that each member receives due remuneration." How can the public interest and the individual interests of members be appropriately satisfied? The draft model regulations stipulate very clearly: The amount of the public accumulation fund, when an agricultural producers' cooperative is first established, should generally not exceed five percent of the cooperative's annual actual income (total value of production minus various consumption in production); as production develops, it can gradually be increased to ten percent. For cooperatives that manage cash crops, the public accumulation fund can be slightly higher. The public welfare fund can generally account for one percent of the cooperative's annual actual income, and as production develops, it can gradually be increased to two or three percent.
    What if there is a disaster and production is reduced, and retaining according to this ratio would cause hardship for the members' lives? The draft model regulations stipulate: In years of poor harvest, the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund can be reduced appropriately; in years of good harvest, they can be increased appropriately.
    If some members want to withdraw from the cooperative, or if new members want to join, or if several cooperatives want to merge, how should the cooperative's public property be handled? The draft model regulations stipulate: All public property accumulated by the cooperative is not allowed to be dispersed. Members who withdraw from the cooperative can only take away the means of production that are still their private property and withdraw their share of the share fund and investment; they cannot divide up any of the public property accumulated by the cooperative. When several cooperatives merge, no cooperative is allowed to divide up all the public property accumulated before the merger. When an old cooperative accepts new members, it should not make any additional demands on them other than requiring them to pay the share fund that they should pay. In the past, some cooperatives required new members to pay supplementary public accumulation and public welfare funds after absorbing them, which was wrong. Didn't the early members suffer a loss by doing this? It should be understood that these public properties are all created by collective strength, belong to the collective, and do not belong to any individual. If it were not for the Communist Party leading everyone to take the path of collectivization, these public properties would never have existed. Every member's individual interests have already been obtained when distributing income, no one has suffered a loss, but rather their income has increased. China's constitution has clear provisions: "Public property is sacred and inviolable," and "The state protects cooperative property." How can sacred and inviolable public property be transformed into private property? Since the public property accumulated by the cooperative does not belong to individuals, there is naturally no need for new members to "make up a share" when joining; moreover, if the cooperative's public property accumulates more and more, how can everyone who joins later "make up a share"? Those who cannot afford to make up a share will not be able to join the cooperative, how can the cooperative become bigger and stronger?
    Order and Timing of Distribution
    In the distribution work of agricultural producers' cooperatives, besides the issue of distribution ratios, there is also the issue of distribution order. The draft model regulations stipulate two distribution methods: The first is: Member families are each responsible for paying agricultural tax, selling nationally purchased agricultural products, and selling agricultural products to purchasing agencies; in this case, distribution should be carried out in the following order: 1. Deduct various consumption in this year's production and reserve them for next year's production expenses; 2. Reserve a certain amount of public accumulation fund and public welfare fund; 3. Pay members' remuneration for land, forests, and livestock, and pay rent for leased land; 4. Distribute members' labor remuneration according to the total labor days of agricultural and sideline occupations and cooperative affairs. The second is: The cooperative uniformly pays agricultural tax, sells nationally purchased agricultural products, and sells agricultural products to purchasing agencies; in this case, the obligations to the state should be fulfilled first, and then distribution should be carried out according to the order mentioned above. The draft model regulations also stipulate: Cooperatives implementing the first method should actively prepare to implement the second method. Why? Because implementing the first method is very inconvenient for the state, it is also more troublesome to distribute for the cooperative, and the obligations to the state are not easy to guarantee. The second method is a more progressive and more reasonable method.
    The distribution of the cooperative is generally carried out after the autumn harvest. Then, what if you need to spend money before the autumn harvest? Many people who have not yet joined the cooperative have such a concern: they are afraid that they will not have pocket money after joining the cooperative. This concern is unnecessary. The draft model regulations have already made provisions: The agricultural products harvested in spring and summer can be pre-distributed to members, and then settled at the end of the production year. How to pre-distribute? The cooperative should first reserve a portion for public needs, and then distribute it according to the number of labor days that the members have already worked, while taking into account the members' actual needs. Only considering the number of labor days without considering the members' actual needs is not right; only considering the actual needs without considering the number of labor days will also hinder the members' labor enthusiasm. After the cooperative reserves a portion of its cash income (income from selling agricultural products and sideline income, etc.) for public needs, members can be allowed to withdraw a portion in advance based on their actual needs. The cash withdrawn by members in advance should generally not exceed the estimated remuneration they should receive for the labor days they have already completed. Some cooperatives, when pre-distributing and allowing members to withdraw in advance, did not calculate in advance according to the labor days done by each member, as a result, some members used more grain and money than they should have received, and could not return the excess; other members could not get what they should have received, which would not be good. By doing according to the provisions of the draft model regulations, this situation can no longer occur.
    Some people need to distribute more cash and less in kind, some people need to distribute more in kind and less cash, some people need more of this grain and some people need more of that grain, some people need more cotton and some people need less cotton, what should be done? The draft model regulations have also made reasonable provisions: The combination of kind and cash distributed to members, as well as the combination of various kinds of kind, should take into account the actual needs of the members as much as possible. For things within the scope of national unified purchase and sales, if some members have a surplus and some have a shortage, the cooperative should adjust them. This is good for the state, the difficulties of some members are overcome, and other members who distribute more cash and other things do not suffer losses.

    按照互利和公私兼顾的原则分配收益
    何成
    农业生产合作社的收益是大伙劳动得来的，自然也要由大伙儿来分配。社员在社里劳动一年，谁也关心：劳动成果究竟要怎样分？自己究竟能分多少？还没有入社的人最关心的也是：入了社能不能增加收入？自己会不会吃亏？
    适当地规定生产资料的报酬
    放心吧，合作社一定要做到适当地分配收益。
    在农业合作社里，必须不损害任何贫农的利益，也不损害任何中农的利益。在处理社内任何问题的时候都是这样，在分配收益这样牵扯到每个社员的切身利益的事情上，更是这样。
    合作社分配收益，首先要实行互利的原则，使贫农中农都不吃亏。在合作社刚成立的时候，一般地说，中农的生产资料多些，好些，贫农的生产资料少些，坏些。为了实行互利的原则，最重要的是把土地和劳动的报酬规定得合适，把别的主要生产资料的报酬也规定得合适。只要劳力和生产资料的报酬都合适了，贫农中农就能两利。
    办了社以后，大家齐心发展生产，生产增加到一定程度，绝大多数社员不要土地报酬收入也比入社以前增加了，社里也有力量照顾特殊困难户了，半劳动力也都有不少活可以干，能得到很多劳动报酬了，大家的觉悟也都提高了，就可以过渡到完全社会主义的高级社，采用那种最合理的、最能鼓励全体社员积极劳动的完全按劳取酬的分配办法。这些，在前边讲解第三章和第四章的时候已经讲过了，这里不再多谈。
    积累公共财产
    在农业生产合作社的收益分配当中，还有一个大家最关心的问题，就是公共财产怎样积累和积累多少。这实际上就是社员个人利益和集体利益怎样正确结合的问题的一个重要部分。合作社年年在分配中总要发生这样的问题：公积金、公益金该留多少？
    有一些合作社的领导人员和社员，没有远大的眼光，不顾发展集体的生产事业和集体的文化福利事业的需要，只看到社员个人眼皮底下的一点点经济利益。这就出了一种奇怪的事情：合作社的生产增加了很多，公积金、公益金却留得很少；社员靠着集体生产增加了很多收入，却不关心集体利益。有些合作社甚至“全部分光，寸草不留”，还说这样容易“显示合作社的优越性”。这不是公私兼顾，而是“公瘦私肥”。这样干会有什么结果呢？一定会是：集体的生产事业和集体的文化福利事业都不能再发展；受到意外的灾害没有足够的力量抵抗，社里的生产还会降低；社员发生了意外的困难，还是像入社以前一样不好克服。社“瘦”了，社员“肥”得也有限，并且还会“瘦”下去。当然，不顾社员的个人收入和生产上、文化福利事业上的实际需要，留下过多的公积金和公益金，也是不对的。
    还有些合作社不愿积累公共财产，是怕社扩大的时候新社员进来沾光。他们说：“可不能咱栽树叫他们歇凉。”他们主张不留或少留公积金，有的甚至主张在扩社、并社的时候把过去的公共财产分掉，等新社员进来“另打锣鼓另开张”。这样，也就出了一种奇怪的事情：合作社发展了，扩大了，社里的社会主义因素却反而减少了；社很大，却很空，怎么能发挥大社的优越性、更多增加生产呢？
    示范章程草案的总则中规定：“农业生产合作社在分配劳动成果的时候，应该给全社留下为发展生产和发展公共文化福利事业所必须的资金，同时使每个社员得到应得的报酬”。究竟怎样才能使公共的利益和社员个人的利益都能适当地满足呢？在示范章程草案里规定得很清楚：公积金的数量，在农业生产合作社初办的时候，一般地不要超过合作社每年实际收入（生产总值扣除生产中的各项消耗）的百分之五；以后随着生产的发展，可以逐步地提高到百分之十。经营技术作物的合作社，公积金可以稍多一些。公益金一般地可以占每年全社实际收入的百分之一，以后随着生产的发展，可以逐步提高到百分之二或者百分之三。
    要是受灾减产了，照这个比例留就会使社员的生活发生困难，那该怎么办？示范章程草案中规定了：在歉收的年份，公积金、公益金可以酌量减少；在丰收的年份，可以酌量加多一些。
    如果有的社员要退社，或者有新社员要入社，或者有几个合作社要合并，对社里的公共财产该怎么处理呢？示范章程草案规定：合作社积累的一切公共财产不允许分散。社员退社，只能带走还是他私人所有的生产资料，抽回他的一份股份基金和投资，不能分走合作社所积累的任何公共财产。几个合作社合并的时候，不允许任何一个社分掉合并前所积累的一切公共财产。老社接受新社员的时候，除了要他交应该交的股份基金以外，不应该对他提出额外的要求。过去有些合作社在吸收新社员以后，要新社员补交公积金、公益金，那是不对的。这样做，先入社的人不是吃亏了吗？要知道，这些公共财产都是用集体力量创造的，是属于集体的，并不属于任何个人。如果不是共产党领导大家走合作化道路，这些公共财产就永远也不会有。每个社员个人应该得的利益，在分配收益的时候已经得到了，谁也没有吃亏，而是增加了收入。我国的宪法有明文规定：“公共财产神圣不可侵犯”，“国家保护合作社的财产”。神圣不可侵犯的公共财产，怎能化为个人所有呢？合作社积累的公共财产既不是属于个人的，新社员入社的时候当然也无须乎“补一份”；再说，合作社的公共财产越积越多，如果要每个后入社的人都“补一份”，怎能补得起呢？补不起的人就都不能入社，合作社怎么能变得更大更有力量呢？
      分配的次序和时间
    在农业生产合作社的分配工作当中，除了分配比例问题以外，还有一个分配次序的问题。示范章程草案里规定了两种分配办法：第一种：由社员家庭各自负责交纳农业税、交售国家所统购的农产品、向采购机关出卖农产品；在这情况下，应该按这样的次序进行分配：1、扣出本年生产中的各项消耗，留作下年的生产费；2、留出一定数量的公积金和公益金；3、支付社员的土地、林木和牧畜的报酬，支付租种的土地租金；4、按照农副业和社务工作的全部劳动日，分配社员的劳动报酬。第二种：由合作社统一交纳农业税、交售统购的农产品、向采购机关出卖农产品；在这情况下，应该先尽了对国家的义务，然后按照上面说的次序分配。示范章程草案还规定了：实行第一种办法的合作社，应该积极准备实行第二种办法。为什么呢？因为，实行第一种办法，对国家来说很不方便，对合作社来说分配起来也比较麻烦，对国家应尽的义务也不容易保证完成。第二种才是比较进步的、更合理的办法。
    合作社的分配一般是在秋收完毕以后进行。那末，秋收以前要花钱怎么办？不少还没入社的人都有这么个顾虑：怕入社以后平常没有零钱用。这种顾虑是不必要的。示范章程草案已经作了规定：春季和夏季收获的农产品，可以预先分给社员，到生产年度终了再结算。怎么预先分配呢？应该先由合作社留下公共需要的一部分，然后按照社员已经做的劳动日的数目，同时照顾到社员的实际需要来分。只按劳动日不顾社员的实际需要是不对的；只按实际需要不按劳动日的多少，也会妨碍社员的劳动积极性。合作社的现金收入（出卖农产品的收入和副业收入等），在社里留下公共需要的一部分以后，可以根据社员的实际需要，允许社员预先支取
  一部分。社员预先支取的现金，一般地不应该超过他已经完成的劳动日预计应得的报酬。有些合作社在预先分配和让社员预先支取的时候，事先没有根据每个社员所做的劳动日加以计算，结果，一部分社员用的粮款超过了他自己应该得的部分，退又退不出来；另一部分社员却得不到他应该得的部分，那就不好了。按照示范章程草案的规定来做，就可以不再发生这种情形。
    有人需要多分现金少分实物，有人需要多分实物少分现金，有人需要这种粮食多，有人需要那种粮食多，有人需要棉花多，有人需要棉花少，怎么办呢？示范章程草案中也已经作了合理的规定：分配给社员的实物和现金的搭配，以及各种实物的搭配，都要尽量照顾到社员的实际需要。属于国家统购统销范围以内的东西，社员中间有多余的，有不足的，合作社应该加以调剂。这样，对国家有好处，
  一部分社员的困难克服了，别的社员多分了现金和别的东西，也不吃亏。
