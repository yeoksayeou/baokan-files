    The Southwest Agricultural Science Research Institute organized one-third of its research and technical personnel this year to work in the rural areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. They cooperated with the local government's agricultural departments to conduct experiments and research on agricultural production techniques in mountainous areas and the development of fertilizer sources, based on summarizing mass experiences. The work group in Mengzi, Yunnan, studied the prevention of rice "reddening fields" (seedlings withering in the field and appearing yellowish-red) and rice drought-resistant yield-increasing technology in Mengzi, Shiping, Jianchuan and other counties, and summarized the experience of farmers in two townships of Mengzi County in drought-resistant replanting and raising drought seedlings. They proposed specific methods such as applying fast-acting fertilizers to save "reddening fields." This experience has been widely disseminated in Shiping, Mengzi, and other counties. Eighty percent of the "reddening fields" in Shiping County have been saved by using this method, increasing rice production.
    The work group conducted investigations and research on the issue of yield reduction in the high-altitude mountainous areas of Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, and Hezhang, Shuicheng, and other counties in Guizhou. They found that the main reason for the small harvest in these areas was severe seedling rotting every year, in addition to shallow plowing and rough cultivation. The scientific workers went deep into the homes of veteran farmers to interview them, conducted detailed field observations, and also investigated the experience of the masses in cultivating dry seedlings. After repeated research, the work group proposed specific methods for field management and seedling soaking to prevent seedling rotting. The local production departments believe that these methods are practical and should be promoted. In order to study the local fertilizer and fertilizer source issues, the work group summarized the experience of the semi-pit composting method (green manure accumulation method) and the improved vat-type fertilizer accumulation method for these areas, and guided local farmers to master this fertilizer accumulation technology.

    西南科学工作者研究出多项农业增产办法    
    西南农业科学研究所在今年组织了全所三分之一的研究、技术人员到云南、贵州和四川的农村中工作，他们同当地政府的农业部门合作，在总结群众经验的基础上对山区的农业生产技术和开辟肥源等问题进行实验和研究。在云南蒙自的工作组分别在蒙自、石屏、建水等县研究了防止水稻“发红田”（秧苗在田内枯萎而呈现黄红色）问题和稻谷的抗旱增产技术，同时总结了蒙自县两个乡的农民抗旱改种和育旱秧的经验。他们提出了用追施速效性肥料等具体办法来挽救“发红田”。这个经验已经在石屏、蒙自等县广泛传播。石屏县有百分之八十的“发红田”运用这种办法得到挽救，使稻谷增产。
    工作组在贵州高寒山区的威宁彝族回族苗族自治县和赫章、水城等县对山区减产问题进行了调查研究。他们发现这些地区收获量小的主要原因是每年烂秧严重；另外是犁地不深、耕作粗放。科学工作者深入到老农家里访问，并且详细进行田间观察，还考察了群众培育旱秧的经验。经过反复研究，工作组提出了有关防止烂秧的田间管理、育苗浸种的具体办法，当地生产部门认为这些办法切实可行，应该推广。为了研究当地肥料和肥源的问题，工作组为这些地区总结了半坑式堆肥法（积绿肥法）和改良瓦瓮式积肥法的经验，并且指导当地农民掌握这种积肥技术。　（新华社）
