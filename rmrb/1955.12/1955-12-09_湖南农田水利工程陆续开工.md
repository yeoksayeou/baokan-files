    Hunan Province's small-scale farmland irrigation projects in mountainous and hilly areas have started construction one after another. The Weishui Shahe irrigation project, the largest in the hilly area of the province, began full-scale construction in early November. After the completion of this project in March next year, it can save more than 112,000 mu of farmland from the threat of drought and 2,000 mu of farmland from waterlogging.
    This winter and next spring, the province plans to renovate and build more than 530,000 small-scale farmland irrigation projects. Upon completion of these projects, the irrigated area of paddy fields will be improved and expanded by more than 7.74 million mu, of which more than 1.9 million mu will have drought resistance capacity for more than 50 days.
    In order to cultivate a mass technical guidance force, various counties in Hunan are running training classes for farmer irrigation technicians. More than 30,000 farmers are being trained. After all the training is completed, each township in the province will have two irrigation technicians who do not leave production to regularly guide farmland irrigation work in their respective townships.

    湖南农田水利工程陆续开工
    湖南省山区和丘陵区的小型农田水利工程，已陆续开工。全省丘陵区最大的沩水沙河灌溉工程，十一月上旬就全面动工。这项工程在明年三月完工后，可以使十一万二千多亩农田免除旱灾威胁，二千亩农田不受积水灾害。
    今冬明春，全省计划整修、新建小型农田水利工程五十三万多处。这些工程完工后，共可改善和扩大稻田灌溉面积七百七十四万多亩，其中有一百九十多万亩将具有五十天以上抗旱能力。
    为了培养群众性的技术指导力量，湖南各县正在开办农民水利技术员训练班，受训练的农民共有三万多人。全部训练完毕后，全省每一个乡都将有两名不脱离生产的水利技术员，经常地指导本乡的农田水利工作。             （本报驻长沙记者）
