Shandong and Hebei Farmers Strengthen Wheat Field Management

In Shandong Province, winter wheat seedlings have generally emerged completely, are vigorous, and are growing sturdily. At present, the vast numbers of farmers throughout the province have already begun winter wheat field management work. Farmers in Jining, Shouzhang, Dong'e, Feicheng, Tai'an, Chagnan, Laiwu and other places are generally treading and rolling their wheat fields. Dong'e County has applied topdressing fertilizer to more than 20,000 mu of wheat fields. Areas with water conservancy conditions have already begun winter irrigation of wheat. Areas in the Heze and Changwei prefectures where soil locusts have occurred are carrying out locust extermination work to protect the seedlings. (Sun Wenlin)

In Hebei Province, farmers implemented the state planting plan and improved the quality of sowing in this year's winter wheat sowing. Seedlings have generally emerged completely, and in a few low-lying areas where there was some lack of seedlings, this has been promptly remedied under the leadership of agricultural cooperatives. In areas where residual locusts have been found harming wheat seedlings, farmers are also actively carrying out eradication.

    山东河北农民加强麦田管理
    山东省冬小麦一般都出苗齐全旺盛，生长茁壮。目前全省广大农民已经开始了冬季麦田管理工作。济宁、寿张、东阿、肥城、泰安、昌南、莱芜等地农民普遍进行踩、压麦田。东阿县有二万多亩麦田施了追肥。有水利条件的地区，已经开始冬浇小麦。菏泽、昌潍等专区发生土蝗地区，正在进行灭蝗保苗工作。　（孙文林）
    河北省农民在今年冬小麦播种中，执行了国家种植计划，提高了播种质量。出苗一般都很齐全，少数低洼地区有些缺苗也在农业合作社的带动下及时补齐。发现残存蝗虫为害麦苗的地区，农民们也在积极除治中。　（陈哲）
