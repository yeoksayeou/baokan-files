    In Order to Use Tractors
    By Our Correspondent Shang Kai
    The development plan for agricultural cooperatives in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, was overfulfilled by November 10th, with the number of cooperative member households reaching 77% of the total number of peasant households in the county. However, at this time, some farmers outside the cooperatives were still hesitant. Some well-to-do middle peasants said: Let's see how it goes for another year! It seemed that the development phase of agricultural cooperatives in the county was coming to an end. The county leadership also believed that this year's plan for developing agricultural cooperatives had been overfulfilled and that they could fully turn to the stage of rectification and consolidation.
    However, things turned out differently than the leaders expected.
    In mid-November, the County Party Committee, based on the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the specific conditions of the county, formulated an overall plan for the county centered on agricultural cooperativization. According to this plan, by the spring plowing season next year, the number of agricultural machinery stations in the county will increase to two, and the area of machine-cultivated land will expand from the current 35,000 mu to 300,000 mu. By the spring plowing season of 1957, the area of machine-cultivated land will expand to 600,000 mu, at which time agricultural mechanization will be basically realized. Brand-new tractor fleets will soon appear in large numbers on the fertile and vast fields of Jieyu County.
    The County Party Committee announced this plan and carried out widespread publicity among the masses. The news, like lightning, immediately spread to every corner of Jieyu County, shaking everyone's hearts. The newly calmed countryside boiled again. Poor and lower-middle peasants who had not joined the cooperatives were elated and eagerly applied to join. They said: If we don't join the cooperatives this year, we will fall behind socialism. Most of the well-to-do middle peasants also quickly and eagerly wanted to take the road of socialism. For example, Zhou Fufa and Zhou Junde, well-to-do middle peasants from Huangqiying, had originally decided to "wait another year"; but when they heard that tractors were coming, they changed their minds. They said: We didn't expect socialism to come so quickly. It will be mechanized the year after next. What are we waiting for if we don't join the cooperatives? So they repeatedly went to the leading cadres of the cooperatives to apply for membership. Moreover, there were also tremendous changes in areas where the cooperative movement had been slow to develop in the past. For example, the masses in Duitailing originally did not plan to build a cooperative this year, but after hearing the news of the county's agricultural mechanization plan, they all said: Don't think we are just a small mountain village, we will not fall behind in taking the road of socialism. On the same night, 34 peasant households out of the 38 in this small village signed up to build a cooperative.
    The upsurge of cooperativization in Jieyu County thus appeared again on a new scale. The Jieyu County Party Committee immediately made a decision: to continue expanding agricultural cooperatives and fully meet the masses' demands for joining. From November 15th to 20th, in just five days, 3,432 new households in the county signed up to join the cooperatives. Among them, well-to-do middle peasants accounted for about 30% of the households that joined this time. This is a new feature. To date, the number of cooperative member households in the county has reached 87%.

    为了能用上拖拉机
    本报记者　商恺
    山西省解虞县发展农业合作社的计划，到十一月十日便超额完成了，入社农户达到了全县农户总数的百分之七十七。不过，这时候一部分社外农民还在那里犹疑不决。有些富裕中农表示：看上一年再说吧！看来全县的合作社发展阶段就要结束了，县的领导上也认为今年发展农业合作社的计划已经超额完成，可以全力转向整顿和巩固的阶段了。
    可是，事情出乎领导人员的意料之外。
    十一月中旬，县委根据省委的指示和本县具体情况，拟定了全县以农业合作化为中心的全面规划。依照这个规划，到明年春耕以前，全县的农业机器站将增加到两个，机耕地面积将由现在的三万五千亩扩大到三十万亩。到一九五七年春耕前，机耕地面积将扩大到六十万亩，那时将基本上实现农业机械化。崭新的拖拉机群，很快就要大量出现在解虞县肥沃广阔的原野上了。
    县委公布了这个规划，并且在群众中展开了普遍的宣传。于是消息像闪电一样，立刻传遍了解虞县的每一个角落，震荡每一个人的心。刚刚平静下来的农村，又沸腾了起来。未入社的贫农和下中农，欢欣鼓舞，纷纷申请入社。他们说：今年再不入社，就要落到社会主义后边了。大部分富裕中农，也迅速地急切地要走社会主义的道路。例如黄旗营的富裕中农周富法和周俊德，本来已经拿定了主意“再等一年”；但是当听到拖拉机就要到来的时候，他们改变了主意，他们说：没想到社会主义来得这样快，后年就要机械化了，再不入社，还等什么？于是他们几次地找社的领导骨干申请入社。不仅如此，过去合作化运动发展缓慢的地区，也发生了巨大的变化。如堆台岭的群众今年原不打算建社了，但是听到全县农业机械化的规划消息以后，都说：不要看我们是小山村，走社会主义道路可不落后。这个三十八户的小村庄，当天夜里就有三十四户农民报名建社。
    解虞县合作化的高潮，就这样又以新的规模出现了。解虞县委立即作了决定：继续扩大农业合作社，完全满足群众的入社要求。从十一月十五日到二十日，仅仅五天的时间里，全县新报名入社的农户，就有三千四百三十二户。其中富裕中农，占这次入社农户的百分之三十左右。这是一个新的特点。到目前为止，全县入社农户已经达到了百分之八十七。
