The Countryside During the High Tide of Cooperativization

	The Sounds in the Mountain Village Have Changed

	In the deep mountains of Xinlou District, Guangning County, Guangdong Province, a stream rushes along, with small villages dotted along its banks. With the upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the lives of the mountain village farmers are surging like the stream after a heavy rain.

	Here, there is the "Red Sun" Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, composed of eighty-nine farming households. Their rice yield this year increased by 23% compared to last year, and this year's sideline income has already reached 17,900 yuan. In every family here, the sound of arguments due to financial difficulties can no longer be heard. Liao Lixian and her husband used to fight frequently in the fields, and later they simply separated. After joining the cooperative, they reconciled. Many female cooperative members have learned many new technologies in collective labor, and their labor income is no less than that of the male members.

	The sound of arguments is gone, replaced by the sound of classes and studying. Every night, if there is no large meeting or a movie (mobile film projection teams often come here), the cooperative members each take a small oil lamp, along with their textbooks and notebooks, to attend night school. Many people who used to rely on cutting bamboo strips to keep accounts can now write and calculate. Sixty-year-old female cooperative member Feng Senjiao often puts on her reading glasses to learn to write after returning home from school. Some women who didn't know a single character in the past can now recognize five or six hundred characters. In collective life, people's thinking progresses very quickly. When the cooperative was established last year, there wasn't a single Party member among the female members, only two Youth League members; now, there are three Party members and nine Youth League members.

	Recently, another sound has been added: In the nearby villages, one can hear the "Red Sun" cooperative members enthusiastically persuading people to take the road of cooperativization. (Wan Wen)

	Breaking Through the "Blockade"

	Last winter, when the Xihe Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Shahou Township, Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province, was established, the members of the mutual aid teams from the twelve households living on the mountaintop all wanted to join. However, the staff in charge of establishing the cooperative thought it would be difficult to lead, so they drew a line halfway up the mountain, saying that those living below the line could join, and those living above the line could not. These mutual aid team members were very distressed and could only secretly complain: Why did our ancestors build their homes on the high mountains!

	This September, Chairman Mao's report on agricultural cooperativization was transmitted to the deep mountains.

	The Shahou Township branch held a meeting of Party members to discuss Chairman Mao's report.

	The staff in charge of running the cooperative reviewed their erroneous thinking of not enthusiastically accepting farmers from the mountains to join the cooperative and immediately convened a meeting of cooperative members to discuss the expansion of the cooperative. Everyone unanimously agreed to accept these twelve farmers living on the mountaintop into the cooperative. The "blockade" on the mountainside was broken. The farmers on the mountaintop smiled. (Li Caiwen)

	Old Woman Applies to Join the Cooperative in the Middle of the Night

	On the night of October 20th, in Chengxi Township, Jiangling, Hubei, an old woman surnamed Li couldn't fall asleep. In the spring, her children and grandchildren all asked to join the cooperative, and she said, "Young people are just troublesome! If you want to join, you'll have to beat me to death and bury me in the ground before you can join!" In October, the cooperative carried out the autumn harvest distribution. She heard that the income of cooperative members whose family background and labor force were similar to hers was two or three times higher than in previous years, and she could no longer feel at peace. That night, when the rooster crowed for the second time, she got up and walked to the home of Wen Daoyuan, the Party branch secretary. Wen Daoyuan thought something had happened at her house and said to her as soon as he opened the door, "Oh! You are sixty or seventy years old, why are you coming here in the middle of the night? Regarding family matters, let's argue less, it's not too late to come in the morning." The old woman didn't seem to hear, walked into the door, and sat down, saying, "Daoyuan! They all want to join the cooperative, can my family join?"

	"Yes, you can." Wen Daoyuan replied, both surprised and happy.

	"I will go to the meeting tomorrow!" The old woman was also happy.

	"Grandma, why do you want to join the cooperative now?"

	"Alas! Let's not talk about the past, the arguments were all about this matter. I can only blame myself for being stubborn, thinking that after the land reform, with land and fields, as long as my children and grandchildren worked hard, we would surely live a good life. The more I look at it, the more it doesn't work! Chairman Mao is right..."

	In the past, she stayed at home all day and refused to attend meetings. Now, she can be seen at meetings of all sizes. Before joining the cooperative, her family had specifically bought a waterwheel. (Xu Daochu)

	The Orchard Mountain of the Cooperative

	In Daqiao District, Xihe County, Gansu Province, there is a village where most of the cultivated land is hillside land, and each mu can only yield a maximum of one hundred jin or so. Many people said that it was impossible to run a cooperative on this mountain. However, here, there is an agricultural producers' cooperative of twenty-two households, which is doing very well.

	The cooperative members have planted countless peach trees, walnut trees, pepper trees, apricot trees, jujube trees, etc., on the mountain. Just the pepper alone can yield more than a thousand jin each year, and each jin can sell for two yuan. This year, the income from peaches was more than one hundred and sixty yuan. These two items alone have made the cooperative members' lives better.

	With more trees planted, floods have also been reduced. There was especially heavy rain this year, but the hillside land was not damaged by the rain.

	Looking at the lush green mountain valley, the cooperative members said proudly: Look, this is all ours in the cooperative! They proposed: to completely transform this mountain into an orchard mountain within five years. (Gansu Daily)

	"Feng Shui Master" Announces Closure of Business

	The high tide of agricultural cooperativization is washing away all decadent things in the countryside and irrigating many new seedlings.

	In Yuanjue Township, Chongning County, Sichuan Province, there is a "feng shui master" named Song Mingyang. He asked to join the agricultural producers' cooperative but was not approved. Because everyone said that he had been deceiving people for many years, promoting superstition, and not working hard, the cooperative did not welcome such people. He felt that there was no future in continuing in this profession and that the only right path was to join the cooperative and work hard, so he actively requested to join the cooperative. He quickly made two wooden signs and placed them on either side of the main road in the village, with the words: "Attention pedestrians, feng shui services are closed, please don't look for me, lest you lose your way."

	On the day the signs were put up, a farmer whose family member had died came to "invite" Song Mingyang to "look at the feng shui."

	"Didn't you see the wooden sign?"

	"I saw it, closed is closed, but I'm asking you just this once."

	"No, I won't do even half a turn!"

	"Then how about this, if you don't look at the gravesite, just please tell me a date, to see which day is good for the burial."

	"Whatever day you want to bury, that day is good, why are you still so superstitious!"

	Soon, Song Mingyang became a popular member of the agricultural producers' cooperative. (Luo Gangzheng)

    在合作化高潮中的农村
    山村里的声音变了
    在广东省广宁县新楼区的深山里，一条溪涧在奔流着，沿岸有一些小村庄。随着农业合作化运动的高涨，山村农民们的生活却像大雨以后的溪涧一样奔腾起来了。
    这里有一个八十九户农民组成的“红太阳”农业生产合作社。他们的稻子今年比去年增产百分之二十三，今年的副业收入已经有一万七千九百元。在这里的每个家庭里，已经听不到因为生活困难而吵架的声音。廖黎仙同她丈夫过去经常在田里打架，后来索性分了家。入社以后，他俩就和好了。许多女社员在集体劳动中学会了许多新技术，她们的劳动收入不比男社员的少。
    没有了吵架的声音，却添了上课、读书的声音。每天晚上，如果不开大会，不看电影（流动电影放映队常来这里），社员们就每人拿一盏小油灯，带着课本、练习本去上夜校。很多过去靠折竹篾记账的人，现在已经会写会算了。六十岁的女社员冯森娇，放学回家以后还经常戴上老花眼镜学写字。有些过去不识一个字的妇女，现在已经认得五六百字。在集体生活当中，人们的思想进步得很快。去年建社的时候，女社员里还没有一个党员，只有两个青年团员；现在，已经有了三个党员、九个团员。
    最近，又多了一种声音：在附近各个村子都可以听到“红太阳”社的社员们热情地劝说人们走合作化道路的声音。　　（婉雯）
    突破了“封锁线”
    去年冬天，陕西省西乡县沙后乡西河农林牧生产合作社成立的时候，这个乡里住在山顶上的十二户人家的互助组组员个个都想参加。可是，建社的工作人员嫌不好领导，就从山腰里划了一道界限，说在界限以下住的可以入社，在界限以上住的不能入。这些互助组员很苦恼，只好暗暗埋怨：前辈人为什么把家安在高山上！
    今年九月，毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告传到深山里来了。
    沙后乡支部召开党员大会讨论了毛主席的报告。
    办社的工作人员检讨了不热情接受山上的农民入社的错误思想，立即召开了社员大会讨论扩大合作社的事情。大家一致同意吸收这十二家住在山顶上的农民入社。山腰里的“封锁线”被突破了。山顶上的农民们笑了。（李彩文）
    老婆婆半夜申请入社
    十月二十日夜里，在湖北江陵城西乡，有一个姓李的老太婆，怎么也睡不着觉。春天，儿孙们都要求入社，她说：“就是年轻人事多！你们要入，就把我打死埋在地里再入吧！”十月，社里进行了秋收分配。她听说家底子、劳动力跟她家相似的社员的收入比往年多了两三倍，心里再也安宁不下来了。这天夜里，鸡才叫两遍，她就起来往党支部书记文道元家里走。文道元以为她家里出了什么事，一开门就对她说：“哎呀！你老人家六七十岁了，怎么深更半夜摸到这里来？为了家事，少吵点嘴算了，天亮来也不迟。”老太婆好像没听到似的，走进门去，一坐下就说：“道元哪！他们都要入社，我家能入不能？”
    “可以。”文道元又惊奇又高兴地回答她。
    “我明天就去开会！”老太婆也乐啦。
    “婆婆，你为什么现在又要入社了？”
    “唉！以往的事莫谈了，几次吵嘴也就为了这件事。只能怪我死脑筋，以为土地改革以后有了田有了地，只要我儿孙劳动好，保险能过好日子。越看越不行啦！还是毛主席说的对……”
    过去，她整天在家里，不肯参加会。这会儿，大小会上都能看见她。入社以前，她家里还特地买了一挂水车。　　（徐道初）
    合作社的花果山
    甘肃省西和县大桥区有一个村子，大部分耕地是山坡地，每亩地最多收入一百来斤。很多人说，在这山上办合作社没有门。可是，这里有一个二十二户的农业合作社，却办得很好。
    社员们在山上种植了无数的桃树、核桃树、花椒树、杏树、枸树等等。光是花椒，每年就能收入一千多斤，每斤能卖两元。今年，桃子的收入有一百六十多元。光这两样，就使社员们的日子过好了。
    树种多了，水灾也减少了。今年暴雨特别多，可是山坡地却没有被雨水冲坏。
    社员们看着绿森森的山湾，自豪地说：看，这都是我们社里的！他们提出：要在五年内把这座山完全变成花果山。　（甘肃日报）
    “阴阳先生”宣告停业
    农业合作化的高潮正在农村中冲洗一切腐朽的东西，灌溉许多新生的幼苗。
    四川省崇宁县元觉乡有一位“阴阳先生”，名叫宋明扬。他要求加入农业生产合作社，没有被批准。因为大家说他多年骗人，宣传迷信，不好好劳动，合作社里不欢迎这样的人。他觉得这种行业再干下去没有什么前途，只有入社好好劳动才是正路，就积极要求入社。他赶快做了两块木牌子，插在村子两头的大路旁，上面写着：“行人注意，阴阳停业，请莫找我，免得误路。”
    插出牌子那天，就有家里死了人的农民又来“请”宋明扬去“看风水”。
    “你没看到木牌吗？”
    “看到了，停业是停业，不过再求你这么一回。”
    “不行，半回也不干啦！”
    “那这样吧，你不给看坟地，就请说个日子，看哪天出葬好。”
    “你愿哪天葬，哪天就好，你还那么迷信咋个嘛！”
    不久，宋明扬就成了一个受人欢迎的农业生产合作社社员。
