Hebei's handicraft industry will basically achieve cooperativization by the end of next year. At that time, individual handicraftsmen participating in handicraft production cooperative organizations will account for 71% of the total number of handicraftsmen in the province. The total annual output value of these handicraft cooperative organizations will be more than 360 million yuan. The above plan for the cooperativization of Hebei's handicraft industry was formulated at the first session of the Hebei Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative Members' Representative Congress recently convened.

In recent years, Hebei Province's handicraft cooperativization has greatly developed. By the end of November this year, the province's handicraft production cooperative organizations had developed to 3,489, and the organized handicraftsmen accounted for 33% of the total number of handicraftsmen. In the Handan, Baoding, and Tangshan areas, the labor production efficiency of some handicraft production cooperative members has increased by 23% to 60% compared with before joining the cooperative, and wage income has increased by 9% to 62%. According to statistics from five special districts and six cities, handicraft production cooperatives have established a total of 83 cultural spare-time schools, with more than 14,000 enrolled members.

    河北手工业明年基本合作化
    河北省手工业到明年年底将基本上实现合作化。那时候，参加手工业生产合作组织的个体手工业者将占全省手工业者总数的百分之七十一。这些手工业合作组织全年的生产总值为三亿六千多万元。以上关于河北省手工业合作化的规划，是在最近召开的河北省手工业生产合作社第一届社员代表大会上制定的。
    几年来，河北省的手工业合作化有了很大的发展。到今年十一月底，全省的手工业生产合作组织已经发展到三千四百八十九个，组织起来的手工业者已经占手工业总人数的百分之三十三。在邯郸、保定、唐山地区，有些手工业生产合作社社员的劳动生产效率比入社前提高了百分之二十三到六十，工资收入增加了百分之九到六十二。据五个专区和六个市的统计，手工业生产合作社共建立了文化业余学校八十三处，入学的社员有一万四千多人。（新华社）
