Gains in the Design Work of the Jining-Erlian Railway
Director of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, Gao Dengbang

Through the construction of the Jining-Erlian Railway, the socialist design thinking and technical level of China's railway design departments have improved another step. When the design of the Jining-Erlian Railway began in 1952, the railway design force was still very weak; personnel came from all directions, and their ideological and technical levels were low, and experience was extremely lacking. Although the area traversed by the Jining-Erlian line is flat and has no particularly difficult projects, the Jining station yard needs to build huge and complex wide-gauge and standard-gauge railway transshipment equipment and various types of signaling devices; the line needs to pass through most areas lacking water sources and with poor water quality, requiring a good solution to the problem of water supply along the line. These were all technologies that Chinese railway designers were unfamiliar with, or even had never encountered. In addition, time was tight and the task was urgent. It took less than six months from the start of the preliminary survey to the completion of the preliminary design for the more than 300-kilometer railway; construction started after the preliminary design was approved, and the technical design was carried out successively while construction was underway, which aggravated the difficulty of the design work. However, under the correct leadership of the Party and the help of Soviet experts, the employees who designed the Jining-Erlian Railway actively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and in the process of learning and working, overcame various difficulties, completed the design tasks in a timely manner, ensured the progress of the construction, enabled the completion of the Jining-Erlian Railway as scheduled, and trained and improved themselves in their work.

Because many technicians have not shaken off the bourgeois design viewpoints, they often only consider problems in isolation and mechanically from the local and immediate needs, do not pay attention to the investigation and research of data, do not pay attention to comparing and selecting various schemes, do not ask about the budget, and lack understanding of the socialist construction policy of practicing thrift and focusing on key construction projects. In addition, due to lack of experience and low technical level, they took many detours in the survey and design of the Jining-Erlian Railway and even caused some mistakes. For example: When designing the gradient, the initial design did not consider matching the limited gradient of the railway within the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic, and mechanically designed according to the maximum limited gradient of the trunk line, which restricted the throughput capacity and was not compatible with the transportation capacity of the railway within the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic. Only after the expert pointed it out was the design modified during the fixed survey, which increased the throughput capacity by one-third. When designing the power lines, water supply pipelines, and drainage pipelines of Jining North Station, the designers did not make overall considerations, and it was not until the construction that it was discovered that they interfered with each other, causing great difficulties for construction and future maintenance. When designing a section of line about 120 kilometers long north of Wondermiao, the designers bypassed a section of stabilized desert without investigation or comparison. Later, the error was corrected by re-surveying, and the line was shortened by more than three kilometers. Due to incorrect hydrological and geological data, 89% of the small and medium-sized bridges and more than 50% of the culverts on the entire line were partially modified during construction; individual ballast yards were abandoned after construction began because no ballast could be mined. Because of the failure to combine China's current economic situation and the sparsely populated areas of the grassland, overly high standards were adopted in many designs. In particular, the initially designed station buildings, roadside residences, toilets, level crossings, watchmen's houses, and platform structures and equipment at small stations along the line were seriously wasteful. Mistakes like the above, after continuous inspection, exposure and criticism, specifically and vividly educated the designers, enabling them to initially establish an overall design thinking and economic viewpoint, and timely correct some erroneous designs. In the second half of this year alone, the cost of designs that have not yet been constructed has been reduced by more than 14.9 million yuan.

Through the construction of the Jining-Erlian Railway, the designers have mastered many new technologies. Jining North Station is currently the newest and most complete transshipment station yard in China. It has arrival and departure marshalling yards required for wide-gauge and standard-gauge trains, wide-gauge and standard-gauge locomotive and vehicle preparation and repair equipment, wide-gauge and standard-gauge different types of centralized interlocking devices, passenger train bogie conversion equipment, transshipment yards for transshipping grease and livestock, transshipment warehouses for transshipping perishable goods such as fruits, refrigerated car icing stations, and complex equipment such as vehicle cleaning and disinfection and oil tank steaming and washing stations. These devices all adopt the advanced technical achievements of the Soviet Union. For example, the passenger train bogie conversion equipment uses electric bridge cranes, which greatly improves efficiency compared to using winches and steam cranes. The wide-gauge and standard-gauge locomotive depots are arranged according to the Soviet Union's advanced assembly line operation methods, and the coal loading equipment is semi-mechanized, which is the first new type of special-class locomotive depot in China that can undertake intermediate repairs. An elevating device that can ice and send ice to entire trains was installed at the icing station, which is unique in China. In terms of dispatching, unified wide-gauge and standard-gauge dispatching equipment is used, which reduces station operation time and improves work efficiency. In terms of signaling, various types of new equipment are used throughout the line. The main lines use Soviet upward steel frame arm-plate signal machines. The Soviet mechanical centralized interlocking device is used at Jining North Station to centrally control turnouts and signal machines, simplify operation methods, save manpower, and avoid traffic accidents caused by human error. In terms of housing construction, the design of warehouses such as the cargo warehouse, oil-adhesive transshipment warehouse, and tank car steaming and washing warehouse at Jining Station adopts the Soviet Union's advanced brick and stone hyperbolic arch structure, which not only saves steel and wood but also reduces the cost by an average of 30% compared with reinforced concrete structures and improves fire prevention, heat prevention efficiency, and durability. In terms of water supply, deep-well drilling work was carried out, and the deep-well drilling technology was initially mastered, and the technology of finding water sources and correctly determining water sources and water volume was learned. In terms of snow prevention, advanced Soviet methods were learned, and open roadbed design and snow fences were adopted, which basically solved the snow prevention problem.

The many gains we have achieved in the design work of the Jining-Erlian Railway are inseparable from the selfless help of the Soviet government and people. In the design process of the Jining-Erlian Railway, Soviet experts often went to the site at their own expense to assist in checking the work, correcting errors in the design, and solving many difficult problems for us. Line expert Kabranov guided us to improve the limited gradient of the Jining-Erlian Railway, which increased the transportation capacity by one-third. Bridge expert Shabri helped us improve the foundation and pier design of the Bawang River Bridge, which reduced construction difficulties and saved the amount of masonry work. Station yard expert Zubkov guided us in the overall layout design of the complex Jining Station and corrected the serious shortcomings in the draft. Station yard expert Khalikov helped us further improve the shortcomings of unbalanced transshipment of goods, too large coefficients, scattered equipment, and too long transshipment lines in the technical design of Jining Station, reducing mechanical equipment and avoiding a lot of waste. Water supply expert Ivaniuk taught us how to correctly determine the method of water source and water volume, and corrected many errors in the water supply design along the line. The Soviet railway department also enthusiastically helped our designers who were sent to the Otbor station to study the passenger car bogie conversion station and other related engineering designs, and also helped us design and manufacture the signal equipment for Jining North Station.

In the future, railway design tasks will increase year by year. We should systematically summarize the experiences and lessons of the design of the Jining-Erlian Railway, promote them universally, and improve the entire railway survey and design work. (Attached picture)

    在集二铁路设计工作中的收获
    铁道部设计总局局长高登榜
    通过集二铁路的修建，我国铁路设计部门的社会主义设计思想和技术水平又提高了一步。一九五二年开始设计集二铁路的时候，铁路设计力量还很薄弱；人员来自四面八方，思想水平和技术水平很低，经验十分缺乏。集二线经过的地区虽然平坦，没有特别艰巨的工程，但是集宁站场要建筑巨大、复杂的宽轨和标准轨铁路的换装设备以及各种类型的信号装置；线路要通过大部分缺乏水源和水质不良地区，需要很好地解决沿线给水问题。这些都是我国铁路设计人员所不熟悉的，甚至是从未接触过的技术。加以时间紧，任务急，三百多公里的铁路，从开始草测到初步设计完成只有不到六个月的时间；初步设计鉴定批准后就开工，一边施工一边陆续进行技术设计，这就加重了设计工作的困难。但是，在党的正确领导和苏联专家的帮助下，设计集二铁路的员工积极学习苏联先进经验，在边学习边工作的过程中，克服了各种困难，及时完成了设计任务，保证了施工的进展，使集二铁路的修建得以如期完成，并且在工作中锻炼和提高了自己。
    由于不少技术人员没有摆脱资产阶级的设计观点，往往只从局部的、眼前的需要孤立地、机械地考虑问题，不重视调查研究资料，不注意比较选择各种方案，不过问预算，对厉行节约和重点建设的社会主义建设方针认识不足，再加以缺乏经验、技术水平不高，在集二铁路的勘测设计中走了不少弯路，甚至造成了一些错误。例如：在设计坡度的时候，最初没有考虑同蒙古人民共和国境内的铁路限制坡度相配合，机械地按干线最大限制坡度设计，使通过能力受到限制，并且同蒙古人民共和国境内铁路的运输能力不相适应。经专家指出后才在定测时修改了设计，使通过能力提高了三分之一。设计集宁北站的电线路、给水管路、排水管路的时候，设计人员没有作总体考虑，直到施工的时候才发现互相干扰，造成施工和今后维修的很大困难。设计人员设计温都尔庙以北约长一百二十公里的一段线路的时候，不经调查、比较，就绕道避开一段已经稳定的沙漠，后来反工重测，才纠正了这个错误，缩短了三公里多的线路。由于水文、地质资料调查得不正确，全线百分之八十九的中小桥和百分之五十以上的涵管设计在施工中都作了局部修改；个别石碴场开工后因为没有石碴可采而被废弃。由于没有结合我国目前的经济情况和草原地区人烟稀少的情况，在许多设计中都采用了过高的标准。特别是最初设计的站房、沿线住宅、厕所、平交道、看守房以及沿线小站站台的结构和设备等都有严重浪费。像以上的这些错误，经过不断的检查揭发批判，具体生动地教育了设计人员，使他们初步树立起总体设计思想和经济观点，及时地纠正了一些错误的设计，仅今年下半年在尚未施工的设计中就降低了造价一千四百九十多万元。
    通过集二铁路的修建，设计人员掌握了不少的新技术。集宁北站是目前国内设备最新、最完备的换装站场，它拥有宽轨、标准轨列车所需要的到发编组场，宽轨、标准轨机车、车辆整备和检修设备，宽轨、标准轨不同型式的信号集中闭塞装置，旅客列车台车转换设备，换装油脂、牲畜的换装场，换装水果等易腐货物的换装库，冷藏车加冰站，以及车辆清洗消毒和油罐蒸洗站等复杂设备。这些设备都采用了苏联先进的技术成就。例如旅客列车台车转换设备，采用了电动桥式起重机，比采用绞车和汽吊车转换大大提高了效率。宽轨、标准轨机务段是根据苏联先进流水作业方法布置的，上煤设备是半机械化的，在国内这还是第一个新型的并且能担任中修的特等机务段。在上冰站设置了国内唯一可以整列车上冰送冰的升降设备。在调度方面采用了宽轨、标准轨统一调度设备，减少了车站作业时间，提高了工作效率。信号方面，全线采用了各种类型的新式设备，主要的在线路上采用了苏联上向式钢架结构的臂板信号机。在集宁北站采用了苏联机械集中式联锁装置，集中操纵道岔和信号机，简化了操作方法，节省了人力，并且可避免发生因人为错误而造成的行车事故。房屋建筑方面，集宁站的货物仓库、粘油换装库、罐车蒸洗库等库房设计，采用了苏联先进的砖石双曲拱结构，不仅节省了钢料、木材，比钢筋混凝土结构平均降低造价百分之三十，还提高了防火、防热效能和耐久程度。给水方面，开展了深井钻探工作，初步掌握了深井钻探技术，学会了寻找水源和正确确定水源、水量的技术。在防雪方面，学习苏联的先进方法，采用了开展式路基设计和防雪栅栏，基本上解决了防雪问题。
    我们在集二铁路设计工作中取得的不少收获，是跟苏联政府和人民无私的帮助分不开的。在集二铁路的设计过程中，苏联专家不辞辛苦地经常到现场协助检查工作，纠正设计中的错误，为我们解决了不少困难问题。线路专家卡布兰诺夫指导我们改善了集二铁路的限制坡度，使运输能力提高了三分之一。桥梁专家沙布里帮助我们改善了霸王河桥基础和桥墩设计，减少了施工困难，节省了圬工数量。站场专家祖布可夫指导我们进行复杂的集宁站的总布置设计，改正了草图中的严重缺点。站场专家哈利可夫帮助我们进一步改善了集宁站技术设计中换装货物不平衡、系数太大、设备分散、换装线太长的缺点，减少了机械设备，避免了不少的浪费。给水专家伊万纽克教会了我们如何正确确定水源、水量的方法，纠正了沿线给水设计中的许多错误。苏联铁路部门还十分热情地在奥特波尔站帮助我们派去的设计人员学习客车台车转换所和其它有关的工程设计，还帮助我们设计并且制造了集宁北站的信号设备。
    今后，铁路设计任务将一年比一年增加。我们应当系统地总结集二铁路的设计的经验教训，普遍推广，把整个铁路勘测设计工作提高一步。（附图片）
