    Plan the Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce
    (Our Newspaper) The Chinese Communist Party committees of Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region recently held meetings to study the work of further carrying out the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, and made plans for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.
    The党员干部会议 (Party member and cadre meeting) convened by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China from December 12th to 16th discussed the plan for the transformation of private industry and commerce. In the future, Beijing will implement the conversion of all capitalist industrial and commercial households into joint state-private enterprises by industry. In 1956, capitalist industry and commerce can basically be converted into joint state-private enterprises by industry. Other small businesses can also be basically transformed by the end of 1957 through cooperation and other forms.
    The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an enlarged meeting to make an overall plan for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in Tianjin, striving to basically convert all private industry and commerce in the city into joint state-private enterprises by industry from now until 1957.
    From December 7th to 17th, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a joint meeting of secretaries of prefectural, municipal, and county party committees, determining that the province will basically complete the plan for implementing joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce in 1957. By the end of 1956, the output value of factories in the province implementing joint state-private ownership will account for 90% of the total output value of the original private factories; the number of commercial households (including capitalist stores and small vendors) included in various forms of state capitalism will account for 69.36% of the original number of private commercial households.
    From December 4th to 13th, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the first provincial municipal (town) party committee secretary meeting. The meeting determined that before the end of 1957, the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in the province, mainly in the form of joint state-private ownership by industry, should be basically completed.
    From December 10th to 17th, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting. The plan for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts made at the meeting stipulated that in the industrial sector, ten industries, such as private power industry, will be transformed first in 1956. By the end of 1956, 75% of private industrial households in the entire autonomous region will have undergone socialist transformation. In 1957, 24 households in five industries, such as non-metallic mineral mining, will be transformed. The socialist transformation of private commerce will also be carried out in full in 1956 and 1957.
    The meetings convened by the Beijing Municipal Committee, Jiangsu Provincial Committee, Guangdong Provincial Committee, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China also studied the issue of further carrying out the socialist transformation of handicrafts. The meeting of Party members and cadres convened by the Beijing Municipal Committee believed that next year the number of handicraftsmen organized in Beijing should and could reach about 80% of the total number of handicraftsmen in the city. The Jiangsu Province's plan determined that by the end of 1956, the number of organized handicraftsmen should account for 70% to 75% of the total number of handicraftsmen in the province. Guangdong Province determined that the cooperativization of handicrafts should be basically completed before the end of 1957.
    These meetings also studied the education and transformation of bourgeois elements and the ideological education on policies for cadres and workers. At the meeting of Party members and cadres convened by the Beijing Municipal Committee, the shortcomings of only paying attention to the transformation of enterprises while neglecting the transformation and education of capitalists in the work of socialist transformation of capitalism were criticized. It was believed that a method combining enterprise transformation and personal transformation must be adopted, organizing capitalists to study, strengthening propaganda and education for them, and paying attention to strengthening the training of progressive core elements in industrial and commercial circles. This meeting also studied the work of establishing Party and League organizations in private factories and stores. Jiangsu Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have separately determined that a large-scale propaganda and education campaign on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce will be launched from now on.

    北京、天津、江苏、广东、内蒙古等地党委  
    规划对私营工商业的改造工作
    本报讯　中国共产党北京市委员会、天津市委员会、江苏省委员会、广东省委员会和内蒙古自治区委员会最近召开会议，研究了进一步对私营工商业进行社会主义改造的工作，作出了对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的规划。
    中共北京市委员会十二月十二日到十六日召开的党员干部会议，讨论了改造私营工商业工作的规划。北京市今后对私营工商业中资本主义户将实行全行业公私合营。在一九五六年，资本主义工商业就可以基本上按行业实行公私合营。其他小商业在一九五七年底以前，也可以通过合作化和其他形式基本上改造完毕。
    中共天津市委员会最近举行扩大会议，对天津市资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作作了全面规划，争取从现在起到一九五七年，把全市私营工商业基本上按行业实行公私合营。
    中共江苏省委员会从十二月七日到十七日，召开了地委、市委、县委书记联席会议，确定全省在一九五七年基本上完成对资本主义工商业实行公私合营的规划。到一九五六年底，全省实行公私合营的工厂的产值就可占原有私营工厂总产值的百分之九十；纳入各种国家资本主义形式的商业户数（包括资本主义商店和小商小贩），将占原有私营商业户数的百分之六十九点三六。
    中共广东省委员会在十二月四日到十三日，召开了全省第一次市（镇）委书记会议。会议确定在一九五七年年底以前，基本上完成全省私营工商业以全行业公私合营为主要形式的社会主义改造。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会十二月十日到十七日举行了扩大会议。会议作出的对资本主义工商业和手工业进行社会主义改造的规划中规定，在工业方面，一九五六年内将先改造私营电力工业等十个行业。到一九五六年底，全自治区将有百分之七十五的私营工业户经过社会主义改造。一九五七年内将对非金属矿开采等五个行业共二十四户进行改造。对私营商业也将在一九五六、一九五七两年内全部进行社会主义改造。
    中共北京市委、江苏省委、广东省委和内蒙古自治区委员会这次召开的会议，还研究了对手工业进一步进行社会主义改造的问题。中共北京市委召开的党员干部会议认为，明年北京市组织起来的手工业者应该而且可能达到全市手工业者总数的百分之八十左右。江苏省的规划中确定，到一九五六年底，组织起来的手工业者要占到全省手工业者总人数的百分之七十到七十五。广东省确定在一九五七年年底以前，基本上完成手工业的合作化。
    这些会议也研究了对资产阶级分子进行教育改造，对干部、职工进行政策思想教育等工作。中共北京市委召开的党员干部会议上，批判了在对资本主义进行社会主义改造工作中只注意企业改造而忽视对资本家进行改造教育的缺点，认为必须采取企业改造和人的改造相结合的办法，组织资本家学习，加强对他们的宣传教育，并且要注意加强培养工商界进步核心分子。这个会议还研究了在私营厂店中建党、建团的工作。江苏省和内蒙古自治区已分别确定，从现在起就要大规模地开展一次关于资本主义工商业社会主义改造的宣传教育运动。
