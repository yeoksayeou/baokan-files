Main Experiences of Large-Scale High-Yield Cotton Production in Xinjiang
Cheng Zhaoxuan, Director of the General Bureau of Economic Crop Production, Ministry of Agriculture

I. Large-Scale High-Yield Cotton Production

This year, the cotton-growing areas in the Manas River Basin of Xinjiang achieved large-scale high-yield cotton production. The Manas River cotton area is a new cotton area developed by the People's Liberation Army Production and Construction Corps. Cotton cultivation began here on a trial basis in 1950, but the average yield was only 51.2 jin per mu (seed cotton, same below); in 1951 and 1952, the trial cultivation was continued and expanded, and the average yield per mu gradually increased to 78.9 jin and 120.4 jin. From 1953, under the guidance of Soviet expert Titov and with the assistance of the August 1st Agricultural College, the advanced Soviet cotton cultivation technology was comprehensively adopted, and the yield increased dramatically. In that year, the average yield per mu on more than 30,000 mu of cotton fields reached 355.35 jin, of which 20,000 mu had an average yield of 402 jin; cotton-growing expert Liu Xuefo achieved a high yield record of 1,349 jin per mu on 1.61 mu of land. In 1954, due to some errors in techniques such as fertilization and irrigation, coupled with an unusually early frost that year, the average yield per mu was only 189.7 jin. This year, due to the correction of technical deviations, even greater high-yield results have been achieved. According to relatively precise appraisal results, the average yield of 8,0114 mu of cotton fields in the Manas River Reclamation Area this year can reach about 400 jin per mu; the average yield per mu of 8,786 mu of cotton fields in Quanshui Farm is 466 jin; the average yield per mu of 134 mu of cotton fields in Paotai Farm can reach 1,043 jin; in the production unit of cotton-growing expert Liu Xuefo, the average yield of 14.04 mu of cotton fields reached 1,155.9 jin, of which 1.05 mu had an average seed cotton yield of 1,400.71 jin per mu (the above yield figures are appraisal figures).

The creation of this high-yield achievement has opened up a broad avenue for further increasing the yield per unit area of cotton fields in cotton-growing areas across the country. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, which created this high-yield achievement, has set an example in learning from the Soviet Union and applying advanced science and technology.

The main reasons why the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps was able to achieve such outstanding large-scale high-yield results are as follows:

First, the advanced Soviet cotton cultivation technology was comprehensively and resolutely implemented. Before 1952, cotton production mainly relied on the original experience of the masses and soldiers, and the technologies adopted were late sowing and sparse planting, seedling suppression, dense seedling retention, late seedling fixing, and large-scale flooding irrigation. In the second half of 1952, the August 1st Agricultural College was established, and Comrade Titov, a Soviet expert, was invited. Comrade Titov conducted on-the-spot investigations of the specific conditions in the Xinjiang cotton area and, with reference to advanced Soviet experience, proposed a complete set of solutions for improving cotton cultivation technology. The Production and Construction Corps conscientiously and comprehensively implemented this set of improved technical solutions. Therefore, since 1953, there has been a basic reform in cotton cultivation technology, and the yield level has been significantly improved.

Second, the corps farms are large-scale socialist productions with strong organizational and leadership forces and relatively good material conditions, making it easier to accept advanced technologies and comprehensively implement them.

Third, the cotton seeds cultivated in the Manas River Reclamation Area in recent years have been the Soviet C-3173 variety. This year, another better new variety, 611Б, was introduced from the Soviet Union, and more than 50,000 mu have been propagated. It is planned to completely replace the C-3173 variety next year. 611Б is an early-maturing type of cotton seed with a relatively compact plant type, an average growth period of 137 days, a boll weight of 4.3 grams (0.5 grams heavier than C-3173), a fiber length of about 28-29 mm (1 mm longer than C-3173), and a lint percentage of 34% to 35% (C-3173 is below 33%). The cotton field where Liu Xuefo created the high-yield record this year was cultivated with the new 611Б variety.

Fourth, the average annual temperature in the Manas River cotton area is 5 to 10 degrees Celsius, the annual rainfall is 150 to 300 mm, and the frost-free period is about 150 days. Although this cotton area is at a higher latitude, it is at a lower altitude, and the summer temperature is quite high. During the main growing period of cotton, the average temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius. Because rainfall is scarce, crop cultivation mainly relies on irrigation, and there is no worry of drought or flood. There is also plenty of sunshine. In addition, there is no pink bollworm in Xinjiang, and other cotton pests and diseases are currently less harmful in this newly developed cotton area. The soil here generally contains more inorganic salt components and is thicker. These conditions are conducive to high-yield cotton production. However, the natural conditions in Xinjiang also have other disadvantages, such as a short frost-free period (early frost generally falls at the end of September and the beginning of October, the earliest in mid-September, and late frost generally falls at the end of April and the beginning of May, and may even be as late as the first and middle ten days of May), so the shortest cotton growing season is only more than 130 days. The climate in the desert grassland area changes drastically, and the seasonal conditions vary greatly each year. The soil in this cotton area is mainly gray-calcareous soil, lacking organic matter, and salinization is relatively serious. In some reclaimed areas, the groundwater level is as high as 1.5 meters or more, or contains heavy salt and alkali. These are all very unfavorable for high-yield cotton production.

Large-scale high-yield cotton production is directly related to the above four aspects, but the most important and decisive factor is the adoption of advanced technology. The process of increasing cotton field yields over the years powerfully illustrates this point. Before 1952, the average yield per mu was only dozens to more than one hundred jin; in 1953, the yield suddenly increased significantly, mainly because of the adoption of advanced Soviet technology. Even now, in the same Xinjiang corps farms, there are still large differences in the cotton yield levels of different production units, mainly due to differences in mastering and promoting cotton cultivation technology.

II. Main Contents of High-Yield Technology

The technology implemented by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is a series of comprehensive technologies.

(1) First, pay attention to conditions such as groundwater level, soil properties, and field surface flatness. According to Xinjiang's experience, the groundwater level in cotton fields should generally be below two meters. If it reaches 1.2 to 1.5 meters, attention should be paid to opening drainage ditches to lower the groundwater level. If it is newly reclaimed land, it is best to plant one or two seasons of grains and green manure before planting cotton. Avoid cultivating cotton on land with high salt content or low-temperature, sticky soil. Maintaining a flat field surface is the basis for correctly implementing irrigation and other field management techniques; cotton fields with uneven terrain must pay attention to taking effective field leveling measures during the reclamation and land preparation process.

(2) Autumn plowing, deep plowing, early application of base fertilizer, autumn and winter irrigation, and attention to moisture conservation. These land preparation and preparation work before sowing are important components of high-yield cotton technology. Since the previous autumn, the Xinjiang Corps Farms have adopted a series of correct technical measures: after the previous crop is harvested, autumn plowing and deep plowing are carried out as early as possible (shallow plowing to remove stubble is carried out first when necessary). The general depth of plowing by tractors is 22 to 27 cm, and the general depth of plowing by animal power is 18 to 20 cm. Cotton field base fertilizer should be turned down during autumn plowing, and the amount of farm manure applied per mu is about 4,000 to 6,000 jin; if it is too late to apply it during autumn plowing, the fertilizer must also be transported to the field in winter and applied in shallow plowing ditches in early spring (shallow plowing depth is about 12 to 15 cm). Cotton fields with low groundwater levels are irrigated once after autumn plowing; fields with groundwater levels as high as 1.5 meters or more or with highly cohesive soil are irrigated shallowly in ditches before autumn plowing or after autumn plowing, according to the actual situation, to avoid soil alkalization caused by excessive irrigation and to avoid excessive soil moisture in the coming spring, which affects cultivation. In areas with little snow accumulation in winter, the land should be harrowed once after autumn and winter irrigation for the winter. In spring, harrowing should be the main method to conserve moisture and avoid plowing and losing moisture; after the ground thaws in spring, moisture is lost quickly, so it must be harrowed early in a timely manner. If the soil is highly cohesive and the soil surface is compacted, the land can also be cultivated and loosened in spring, and then harrowed and mulched immediately after cultivation. In short, it is necessary to rely on autumn and winter irrigation and spring harrowing to maintain soil moisture at the time of sowing; spring irrigation should not be carried out to avoid delaying cultivation, lowering soil temperature, and delaying sowing and emergence time.

(3) Use the slack time in winter and spring to carefully select the excellent cotton seeds that have been retained. Carry out seed sunning ten to fifteen days before sowing to promote the after-ripening effect of the cotton seeds. All cotton seeds are mixed with 5/1000 to 10/1000 of Ceresan disinfectant, and 50% of the weight of the cotton seeds is added twice before sowing, and then they are piled up and sealed for about 24 hours to allow the seeds to begin to germinate internally. Then mix with sand and sow.

(4) Advance the cotton sowing period as much as possible. The method of mastering timely sowing is that when the temperature at a depth of 5 cm underground rises to 11 to 12 degrees Celsius, sowing can be carried out; another method is to grasp the local climate law to determine the sowing period, so that the cotton seeds spend the late frost period in the soil, and as soon as the late frost passes, the cotton buds can begin to emerge from the soil. For example, the general late frost period in the Manas River cotton area is in early May. This year, the general sowing period started on April 28, and next year it is planned to start earlier on April 20. The sowing amount is stipulated to be 14 to 16 jin per mu, and the row planter sows about 70 seeds per meter. The sowing depth is generally 4 or 5 cm. If the soil surface is compacted after sowing, break the soil in time with a cross harrow to help the cotton seedlings emerge from the soil. The row spacing and plant spacing currently used are generally 60 cm row spacing and 13 to 15 cm plant spacing, with 7,000 to 8,000 plants per mu; another method is wide and narrow rows of 60 cm and 20 cm, with 20 cm plant spacing, and cross-fixing seedlings, with 8,300 plants per mu. The row spacing for machine cotton harvesting is 70 cm. In order to ensure the normal development of the seedlings, thinning is started when some cotton seedlings emerge and the cotton rows can be identified (when the sowing density is not uniform, thinning should be carried out after the seedlings start to emerge), and seedling fixing is completed when there are two or three true leaves. Generally, one thinning and one fixing are carried out. When there is confidence in preserving the seedlings, the seedlings can be fixed with one thinning. Use a ruler to measure and correctly fix the seedlings according to the specified number of plants. When thinning, pay attention to removing weak and inferior seedlings and take them out of the field for destruction.

(5) When some cotton seedlings emerge from the soil and start to be able to identify the cotton rows, the first early cultivation is carried out to increase the soil temperature and promote seedling development (to avoid pressing the seedlings, the early cultivation should be far away from the seedlings). After that, cultivate once every 8 to 10 days. Generally, cultivate about 7 to 9 times during the entire growth period. It is required to always maintain the loose state of the field surface. Immediately after each irrigation, the soil should be cultivated and loosened in time as soon as it is possible to go down to the ground. The depth of cultivation should follow the principle of shallow first, then deep, then shallow again, 8 to 10 cm when shallow, and 13 to 15 cm when deep.

(6) Topdressing is applied for the first time after seedling fixing, mainly with nitrogen fertilizer, and 10 to 20 jin of ammonium sulfate is applied per mu. Topdressing is applied for the second time at the beginning of budding, and topdressing is applied for the third time at the beginning of flowering, both mainly with phosphate fertilizer, using mixed fertilizer or granular fertilizer containing 10% to 20% superphosphate (the rest of the fertilizer is mainly decomposed farm manure, mixed with some oil residue), each time applying 100 to 200 jin per mu (the total amount of superphosphate applied in stages per mu is about 40 jin as a standard). Generally, topdressing is applied at least twice, and if conditions permit, it is applied three times, and sometimes even a fourth time during the full bloom period. The fertilization method is ditch application between rows using a fertilizer applicator. Several topdressings should be applied at different locations and depths. For example, Liu Xuefo's high-yield field had three topdressings: the first time was applied 10 cm away from the seedling, 10 cm deep, the second time was applied 12 cm away from the seedling, 12 to 13 cm deep; and the third time was applied 14 cm away from the seedling, 15 cm deep.

(7) In terms of irrigation, the main principles are: do not suppress seedlings, water early when water is needed; adopt scientific methods of furrow irrigation or trickle irrigation, appropriately control the amount of irrigation water, and oppose large-scale flooding irrigation; the water cut-off period should not be too late, generally no later than the end of August. The number of irrigations during the entire growing period is generally about 6 or 7 times for general soil, 8 to 10 times for sandy soil with high permeability, 4 or 5 times for light clay soil with strong water retention, and only 2 or 3 times for some sticky soil or land with high groundwater levels and heavy salt content. Each time, 40 cubic meters of water per mu is used as a standard. Except for a few times in the middle when trickle irrigation is sometimes needed to increase the amount of irrigation water, furrow irrigation is generally implemented. The furrow depth is 12 to 14 cm during the seedling stage and 20 cm during the peak growth period. The irrigation water depth does not exceed three-quarters of the furrow depth. In the period from 10:00 am to 2:00 or 3:00 pm, irrigation of cotton fields should generally be avoided. At other times and at night, it must be used as much as possible to achieve timely irrigation.

(8) Pruning is generally stipulated to be carried out in two stages. The first stage is to remove the leaf branches below the first fruit branch when one or two flower buds begin to appear; the second stage is to top and remove the terminal buds in late July to early August. When topping, it is required to have 15 to 18 fruit branches (including axillary fruit branches), and the time should not be too early. After topping, continue to remove the terminal buds. Generally, three or four fruit nodes are left on the lower fruit branches, two or three fruit nodes are left on the middle fruit branches, and one or two fruit nodes are left on the upper fruit branches. In addition, remove excess buds at any time as needed. To prevent bud and boll pests, the topped terminal buds should be taken out of the field for treatment.

(9) In terms of disease and pest control, focus on preventing diseases and pests through autumn deep plowing, seed dressing with pesticides, and clearing weeds. Corps farms attach great importance to preventing the introduction of pink bollworm into Xinjiang. When diseases and pests are discovered, they are treated early with pesticides and machinery. On July 3, cotton bollworms were just discovered on Liu Xuefo's high-yield cotton field, and when the infestation rate was about 2%, the farm sprayed 666 powder once, and then sprayed it again on July 15. Because the spraying was timely, although it was sprayed only twice, it was no longer harmed by cotton bollworms.

(10) Remove cotton stalks as soon as possible after frost. Cotton stalks should be removed immediately after heavy frost so that autumn plowing can be carried out in time. After severe frost, the growth effect of the cotton plants has stopped, and there will not be much loss to the harvest of frost-after flowers after pulling the stalks and processing the cotton bolls.

(11) In order to ensure that a production unit continuously improves cotton production, the Xinjiang Corps Farms have carried out regular field planning according to specific conditions, built shelter forests and field protection forests according to this plan, and gradually implemented the rotation system of pasture and cotton.

    新疆棉花大面积丰产的主要经验
    农业部经济作物生产总局局长　程照轩
    一、棉花大面积丰产
    今年新疆玛纳斯河流域棉区获得了棉花大面积丰产成绩。玛纳斯河棉区是由人民解放军生产部队开辟的新棉区。一九五○年这里开始试种棉花，但是平均每亩只产五十一点二斤（籽棉，下同）；一九五一和一九五二两年继续扩大试种，每亩平均产量逐步提高到七十八点九斤和一百二十点四斤。一九五三年起，在苏联专家提托夫的指导和八一农学院的协助下，开始全面地采用苏联的先进植棉技术，产量飞跃提高，当年三万多亩棉田每亩平均产量达到三百五十五点三五斤，其中二万亩平均产量达四百零二斤；植棉能手刘学佛在一点六一亩地上获得平均每亩一千三百四十九斤的高额丰产纪录。一九五四年由于在施肥、灌溉等技术上犯了一些错误，加以当年早霜降得特别早，平均每亩产量只有一百八十九点七斤。今年，由于纠正了技术上的偏差，便获得了更大的丰产成绩。根据比较精密的鉴定结果，今年玛纳斯河垦区八千零一百一十四亩棉田的平均产量，每亩可达到四百斤左右；泉水地农场的八千七百八十六亩棉田，平均每亩产量为四百六十六斤；炮台农场有一百三十四亩棉田，平均每亩产量可达一千零四十三斤；在植棉能手刘学佛的生产单位里，有十四点零四亩棉田平均产量达一千一百五十五点九斤，其中一点零五亩，平均每亩籽棉产量可达一千四百点七一斤（以上产量数字均系鉴定数字）。
    这一丰产成绩的创造，为全国棉区进一步提高棉田单位面积产量开辟了一条大道，创造这一丰产成绩的新疆生产部队，在学习苏联，运用先进的科学技术方面做出了榜样。
    新疆生产部队所以能获得这样突出的大面积丰产成绩，主要有以下四个原因：
    第一、全面地、坚决地推行了苏联的先进植棉技术。一九五二年以前，棉花生产主要是依靠群众和战士的原有经验，采用的技术是晚播稀植、蹲苗、密留苗、晚定苗、大水漫灌等。一九五二年下半年，八一农学院成立，聘来了苏联专家提托夫同志。提托夫同志实地考察了新疆棉区的具体条件，参照苏联的先进经验，提出了一整套改进植棉技术的方案。生产部队认真地、全面地贯彻执行了这一套改进技术方案。因而，从一九五三年起，植棉技术有了基本的改革，产量水平有了显著的提高。
    第二、部队农场是社会主义性质的大规模的生产，组织领导力量强，物质条件比较好，对先进技术也比较容易接受和全面地贯彻实施。
    第三、玛纳斯河垦区几年来栽培的棉种是苏联的C—三一七三号良种，今年又自苏联引进另一种较好的新良种六一一Б，已经繁殖了五万多亩，明年准备全部更换C—三一七三号。六一一Б是早熟类型的棉种，株型比较紧凑，平均生长期一三七天，铃重四点三克（较C—三一七三重零点五克），纤维长度约二十八—二十九毫米（较C—三一七三增一毫米），衣分率是百分之三十四到三十五（C—三一七三在百分之三十三以下）。今年刘学佛创造的高额丰产纪录的棉田，就是栽培的六一一Б新良种。
    第四、玛纳斯河棉区年平均温度是摄氏五到十度，年雨量是一百五十到三百毫米，无霜期约一百五十天左右。这个棉区虽然纬度较高，但是地势较低，夏季温度相当高，棉花主要生长期间，平均温度在摄氏二十度以上。因为雨水稀少，栽培作物主要依靠灌溉，没有旱涝之患，日照也多。另外，新疆没有红铃虫，其他棉花病虫害在这个新辟的棉区，目前为害也较轻。这里的土壤一般含无机盐成分多，地力较厚。这些条件，都有利于棉花丰产。但是新疆的自然条件也有其它的不利的一面，如无霜期短（早霜降霜一般在九月底十月初，最早在九月中旬，晚霜一般在四月底五月初，也可能迟至五月上、中旬），因此棉花生长季节最短时仅一百三十多天。沙漠草原地带的气候变化剧烈，每年的季节条件也有较大的差别。这个棉区土质主要是灰钙土，有机质缺乏，盐渍化比较严重，部分垦区地下水位高至一点五公尺以上，或含较重的盐碱。这些，对棉花丰产都是很不利的。
    棉花大面积丰产同以上四方面都有直接的关系，但是其中最主要的决定性的因素，则是采用了先进技术。历年棉田产量提高的过程，就有力地说明了这一点。在一九五二年以前，每亩平均产量只达到几十斤至一百多斤；一九五三年产量突然大量提高，其主要原因是接受了苏联的先进技术。就是在目前，同是新疆部队农场，不同生产单位的棉花产量水平也有很大差别，主要原因在于掌握和推行植棉技术上有差别。
    二、丰产技术的主要内容
    新疆生产部队所实施的技术，是一系列的综合性的技术。
    （一）首先注意地下水位、土壤性质及田面平整等条件。根据新疆的经验，棉田地下水位一般应该在两公尺以下，如果达到一点二到一点五公尺，就要注意开排水沟，降低地下水位。如果是新垦地，最好先种一、二季谷类和绿肥，再种棉花。避免在土壤含盐量多或低温粘重的土地上栽培棉花。保持田面平整是正确地实施灌溉及其他田间管理技术的基础；田间高低不平的棉田，必须在开垦和整地的过程中，注意采取有效的平田措施。
    （二）秋耕深耕，早施基肥，秋冬灌溉，注意保墒。这些播种前的整地和准备工作，是棉花丰产技术中的重要组成部分。新疆部队农场从上一年秋季起即采取一系列正确的技术措施：前作收获后，及早进行秋耕深耕（必要时先进行一次浅耕灭茬），拖拉机耕地的一般深度是二十二到二十七公分，畜力犁耕地的一般深度是十八到二十公分。棉田基肥要在秋耕时翻下，每亩施用厩肥量约四千斤到六千斤；如果来不及在秋耕时施用，也必须在冬季把肥料运到田间，在早春实行浅耕沟施（浅耕深度约十二到十五公分）。地下水位不高的棉田，在秋耕后进行一次灌溉；地下水位高至一点五公尺以上或土壤粘性较大的田，根据实际情况在秋耕前先灌，或秋耕后开沟浅灌，以避免灌水过多引起土壤碱化，也避免来春土壤湿度过大，影响耕作。冬季积雪少的地方，秋冬灌溉后，要耙一次地过冬。春季以耙耱保墒为主，避免翻地跑墒；春季地开冻后，跑墒很快，必须及时早耙。如果是土质粘性大、土面板结的田，春季也可进行中耕松土，耕后随即耙耱。总之，要做到依靠秋冬灌溉和春耙保墒来保持播种时的土壤水分；不进行春灌，以免耽误耕作，降低地温，延晚播种和出苗时间。
    （三）利用冬春农闲时间对所选留的优良棉种进行仔细的粒选。播种前十天至十五天实行晒种，以增进棉籽的后熟作用。全部棉种用千分之五到千分之十的赛力散药剂拌种，并在临播种时分两次加占棉种重量百分之五十的水分，堆置后闷种约二十四小时，使种子内部开始萌动。然后拌砂播种。
    （四）尽可能提早棉花播种期。掌握适时播种的办法，一个是地下五公分深度的地方温度上升到摄氏十一到十二度时，即可播种；另一个是掌握当地的气候规律，确定播种期，使棉籽在土内度过晚霜期，一俟晚霜过去，棉芽就可开始出土。如玛纳斯河棉区一般晚霜期是五月上旬，今年一般播种期从四月二十八日开始，明年准备更提早到四月二十日开始。播种量规定每亩十四到十六斤，条播机每公尺下籽七十粒左右。播种深度一般四、五公分。播种后如果遇上土面板结，就及时横耙破土，帮助棉苗出土。现在采用的行株距一般是行距六十公分，株距十三到十五公分，每亩七千到八千株；另外也有一种作法是六十公分和二十公分的宽窄行，株距二十公分，交叉定苗，每亩株数八千三百株。机器收花行距是七十公分。为保证幼苗的正常发育，出现一个真叶时就开始间苗（如下种密度不均匀时，开始出苗后就要进行疏苗），到两三个真叶时定苗完毕。一般实行一次间苗一次定苗。保苗有把握时可一次间苗就定苗，定苗时用尺子量，按照规定的株数正确地定苗。间苗时注意间除弱劣苗，并且带出田外消毁。
    （五）在部分棉苗出土，开始能辨认出棉行的时候，就进行第一次早中耕，以增加地温，促进幼苗发育（为避免压苗，早中耕要距苗远些）。以后约每隔八到十天进行一次中耕，全生育期一般约中耕七到九次。要求经常保持田面的疏松状态。每次灌溉后一俟能够下地，应该即及时进行中耕松土。中耕深度掌握先浅后深再浅的原则，浅时八到十公分，深时十三到十五公分。
    （六）定苗后就施用第一次追肥，以氮肥为主，每亩施用硫氨十到二十斤。开始现蕾施第二次追肥，初花期施第三次追肥，都以磷肥为主，用含百分之十几到二十的过磷酸石灰的混合肥料或颗粒肥料（其余肥料以腐熟厩肥为主，同时掺入一部分油渣），每次每亩施用一百到二百斤（每亩分次施用过磷酸石灰的总量约以四十斤为标准）。一般至少施用两次追肥，有条件的施用三次，有时并且在盛花期施用第四次。施肥方法用施肥器在行间沟施，几次追肥要施在不同地位和深度。如刘学佛的丰产田的三次追肥，第一次施在距苗十公分处，深十公分，第二次施在距苗十二公分处，深十二到十三公分；第三次施在距苗十四公分处，深十五公分。
    （七）在灌溉方面，主要原则是：不蹲苗，需水的时候就早浇；采用沟灌或细流灌溉的科学方法，适当控制灌水量，反对大水漫灌；止水期不宜过晚，一般不迟于八月下旬。全生长期灌溉次数一般土壤约六、七次，砂性土透水性较大的田八到十次，轻粘土保水力较强的田四、五次，部分粘性大的地或地下水位高，含盐分较重的田，只灌溉二、三次。每次以每亩灌四十立方公尺的水量为标准，除中间几次为了增加灌水量有时需要采用细流灌溉的办法外，一般都实行沟灌，苗期沟深十二到十四公分，生长盛期沟深二十公分，灌水深度不超过沟深的四分之三。在上午十时到下午二、三时的一段时间内，一般避免浇灌棉田，其他时间和夜晚，则必须尽量利用，做到及时灌溉。
    （八）整枝一般规定分两个阶段进行。第一阶段在开始出现一、二花蕾的时候脱去第一果枝下部的叶枝；第二阶段在七月下旬至八月初打顶及打群尖。打顶时要求有十五到十八个果枝（包括桠果枝），时间不必太早。打完顶后继续打群尖，一般下部果枝留三、四个果节，中部留二、三个果节，上部留一、二个果节。此外，根据需要随时去掉赘芽。为防除蕾铃害虫，要把打下的顶尖等带出田外处理。
    （九）在防治病虫害方面，着重通过秋耕深耕、药剂拌种，清除杂草等办法预防病虫害。部队农场对防止红铃虫的传入新疆，非常重视。发现病虫时就用药械早治。七月三日在刘学佛的丰产棉田上，刚发现棉铃虫，为害率约百分之二时，农场就喷了一次六六六粉，七月十五日又喷了一次，由于喷治及时，虽仅喷治两次，就没有再受到棉铃虫的为害。
    （十）霜后及早清除棉秸。下严霜后应该立即清除棉秸，以便及时进行秋耕。严霜后棉株的生育作用已经停止，拔秸后处理棉铃对霜后花的收量也不会有多大损失。
    （十一）为了保证一个生产单位不断提高棉花产量，新疆部队农场已经根据具体条件，进行了正规的田区规划，根据这一规划营造防护林带和护田林，并且逐步实施牧草和棉花的轮作制。
