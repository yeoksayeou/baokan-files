    A Good Example
    Li Zhang
    Recently, all parts of the country have been formulating agricultural production plans for 1956. Many regions have put forward the slogan of completing the 1957 plan targets in 1956 and have stipulated specific measures to achieve these active production plans. An unprecedented upsurge in agricultural production is about to appear in the vast rural areas of our country.
    Like many other regions, the Liaocheng Special District of Shandong has already set its agricultural production plan for 1956. Comrade Zhang Xincun, Secretary of the CCP Liaocheng District Committee, wrote an article entitled "Go All Out to Organize a Production Upsurge and Strive to Exceed the Five-Year Plan Targets in Four Years," which was published in the Shandong "Dazhong Daily" on December 24. According to this plan, the Liaocheng Special District will increase grain production (including potatoes) by more than one billion jin in 1956, an increase of 50 percent. The grain available per capita in the district will increase from 512.5 jin this year to 760 jin; cotton production in 1956 will increase by 40 percent compared to this year, peanut production will increase by 30 percent, and other crops will also have significant increases in production.
    This is an ambitious plan, and also an achievable plan.
    Why do they dare to set such an ambitious plan? This is the result of going deep into the masses and studying the actual situation. In October, the District Committee convened a meeting of activists, which proposed overcoming conservative thinking and welcoming a production upsurge, but only stipulated an increase of 8 percent, striving for an increase of 12 percent. After the meeting, several responsible comrades of the District Committee went deep into the masses to understand the situation and investigate the "bottom line" of agricultural production. They found that the production plans and actual production increase rates of the agricultural production cooperatives were higher and greater than the plans of the District Committee. In addition, the Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial agricultural production conference, which seriously criticized right-leaning conservative thinking. Under the enlightenment of both the leadership and the masses, the District Committee raised the grain production target to 40 percent. Later, the comrades of the District Committee went deep into the villages again, held discussions with cooperative chairmen and individual farmers, comprehensively analyzed production potential, and specifically studied ways to increase production, receiving further enlightenment. Finally, they raised the grain production target to 50 percent. This tortuous process eloquently illustrates an ironclad fact: the production potential in our agriculture is endless. The more production potential is tapped, the higher the production plan is raised, and the greater the agricultural harvest increases. Whoever can help farmers tap their potential well is a good rural worker and will inevitably gain the trust of the farmers. Some people ask: Where is the production potential? The experience of Liaocheng shows that the masses possess a wealth of knowledge and experience in the rational utilization of land, intensive cultivation, and elimination of pests and diseases. When this knowledge and experience is combined with agricultural production cooperatives, it can generate enormous power. As long as we rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, go deep into reality, and learn from the masses, we can unearth the production potential.
    Why do we say this is an achievable plan? They not only formulated seven technical measures based on the natural conditions of the district and the farming habits of the masses, such as increasing the planting of high-yield crops, increasing the application of fertilizers, carrying out mass agricultural water conservancy, and eliminating pests and diseases, but also formulated methods to strengthen the specific leadership of the Party based on the local rural class situation and the conditions of mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The peasants are willing to increase production, and their enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. As long as the Party's specific leadership keeps up in a timely manner and adopts technical measures that truly suit the actual local conditions, this advanced production plan can be realized.
    The production plan of the Liaocheng Special District is a good example. Other regions have also produced such good examples. Spreading these good examples will inevitably have a great impetus to agricultural production next year.

    一个好的榜样
    黎璋
    最近全国各地都在制定一九五六年的农业生产计划。许多地区提出了在一九五六年完成一九五七年的计划指标的口号，并且规定了实现这些积极的生产计划的具体措施。一个规模空前的农业生产的高潮，就要在我国的广大农村中出现。
    像其他许多地区一样，山东聊城专区已经定出一九五六年的农业生产计划。中共聊城地委书记张新村同志写了一篇题为“全力组织生产高潮，为争取五年计划指标四年超额完成而奋斗”的文章，登在十二月二十四日的山东“大众日报”上。按照这个规划，聊城专区将在一九五六年增产粮食（包括薯类）十亿多斤，即增产百分之五十，全区每人分得的粮食将由今年的五百一十二点五斤增加到七百六十斤；一九五六年棉花产量将比今年增产百分之四十，花生增产百分之三十，其他农作物也将有大量的增产。
    这是一个富有理想的计划，也是一个能够完成的计划。
    他们为什么敢于定出这个富有理想的计划呢？这是深入群众、研究实际的结果。十月份，地委召开的活动分子会议，曾经提出克服保守思想，迎接生产高潮，但是只规定增产百分之八，争取增产百分之十二。会议以后，地委几个负责人员深入群众了解情况，调查研究农业生产的“底”，发现农业生产合作社的生产规划和实际增产速度比地委的计划又高、又大，加以省委召开了全省农业生产会议，严肃地批判了右倾保守思想，地委在领导和群众两方面启示之下，把粮食增产指标提高到百分之四十。以后，地委的同志们又深入乡村，同合作社社长、单干农民进行座谈，全面分析生产潜力，具体研究增产办法，得到进一步的启示，最后才把粮食增产指标提高到百分之五十。这个曲折的过程，雄辩地说明了一个铁的事实：我国农业中的生产潜力是无穷无尽的，生产潜力多挖一分，生产计划就提高一分，农业收获就增加一分；谁能帮助农民很好地挖掘潜力，他就是一个好的农村工作人员，必然得到农民的信赖。有人问：生产潜力究竟在哪里呢？聊城的经验说明，群众中蕴藏着许许多多合理利用土地、精耕细作、消灭病虫害……的知识和经验；这些知识和经验同农业生产合作社结合起来，就能产生极大的力量。只要依靠互助合作组织，深入实际，向群众学习，就能把生产潜力发掘出来。
    为什么说这是一个能够实现的计划呢？他们不仅根据本区的自然条件和群众的耕作习惯，定出增种高产作物、增施肥料、开展群众性的农田水利、消灭病虫害等七项技术措施，而且根据当地农村的阶级状况和互助合作组织的状况，定出加强党的具体领导的办法。农民是愿意增产的，他们的积极性是空前高涨的，只要党的具体领导及时跟上去，并且采取真正适合当地实际情况的技术措施，那末，这先进的生产计划就能实现。
    聊城专区的生产计划是一个好的榜样。其他地区也出现了这种好的榜样。把这些好的榜样传播开来，对于明年的农业生产必然发生极大的推动作用。
