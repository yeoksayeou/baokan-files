    Moscow, December 21st (Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) – Over 20,000 representatives from all circles in Moscow gathered at Central Airport on the afternoon of the 21st to welcome Bulganin and Khrushchev. Groups of people clustered in the snowy, cold wind. In several places, the snow-covered ground was trampled into something like a mirror of ice. People waited with excitement for the return of their beloved leaders. They discussed Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan over the past month. The far-reaching impact of this visit on strengthening and promoting friendship between the Soviet Union and these countries, and on consolidating and expanding the world's peace-loving front, was already very clear, both from the joy of peace-loving people and the shock of the colonialists.

    At 3:20 PM, the twin-engine silver-gray "○○一" plane slowly landed in front of the crowd. Bulganin and Khrushchev got off the plane and shook hands with Soviet party and government leaders and representatives from all walks of life in Moscow. They then ascended a temporary platform surrounded by red cloth together. The mass rally began with the Soviet national anthem.

    Yasnov, Chairman of the Moscow Soviet; Kuzmin, a lathe operator from the "Red Proletarian Factory" representing Moscow workers; and Fedorova, a Meritorious Teacher of the Russian Federation representing Moscow intellectuals, successively delivered speeches expressing a warm welcome and unanimously thanking Bulganin and Khrushchev for their enormous contribution to the cause of world peace and security.

    Khrushchev and Bulganin then gave brief accounts of their impressions of the visit.

    Khrushchev said, "After a month of visiting India, Burma, and Afghanistan, three countries friendly to us, we have returned here filled with deep impressions. The deepest of these impressions is that we have experienced the deep love and most sincere respect that the people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan have for our country and for the Soviet people."

    "In various cities of India, hundreds of thousands, millions of people came out to welcome us. Wherever we went, we heard and read simple words from the hearts of the Indian people: Long live the friendship between the Indian people and the Soviet people! Russians and Indians are brothers!"

    "And we also said to these people: Yes, we are brothers! We are brothers not only in days of peaceful life, but also in times of severe trials. We are brothers in the struggle for a better future for humanity, brothers in the struggle for world peace."

    "In Burma and Afghanistan, the people and leaders of these countries also welcomed us with the same warmth and kindness."

    Khrushchev said, "In the speeches we delivered in India, Burma, and Afghanistan, we exposed the criminal policies of the colonialists. The people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan agreed with what we said, but some people in bourgeois countries, especially reactionary newspapers, hate these words madly. This hatred is completely understandable. The colonial system is collapsing. It has gone bankrupt in Asia. Colonialism is a disgrace to modern humanity. We have said this in the past, and we will never stop repeating it until the colonialists no longer exist."

    Khrushchev continued, "We met with all kinds of people, representatives of all classes. They praised our country's peaceful foreign policy and the Soviet government's efforts to maintain and consolidate world peace. We have the 370 million people of India, as well as the people of Burma and Afghanistan, as our allies in the struggle for world peace."

    "India is a very good friend of our country. India, like the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, firmly stands on the front of the struggle for peace."

    "As Lenin taught us, India, China, and the Soviet Union, this is an invincible force."

    Khrushchev concluded, "We visited India, Burma, and Afghanistan at a time when the entire Soviet Union was preparing to welcome the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. We welcome the 20th Party Congress with the great achievements we have made in further consolidating the Soviet socialist state and strengthening our country's international position. Our task is to make every effort to develop our national economy, especially its basic heavy industry, to ensure the continued high tide of all sectors of agriculture, to strengthen the friendship of all nationalities in our country, and to strengthen the spiritual and political unity of all working people in our socialist society."

    Bulganin said, "Our visit, which is of great significance in all respects, has lasted for more than a month. We have seen a lot and learned a lot. Wherever we went, we saw the most sincere gratitude to the Soviet Union, gratitude for its peaceful foreign policy, and gratitude for its policy of advocating friendship and cooperation among all countries. We are convinced that the warm and enthusiastic welcome we received everywhere from the people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan is a manifestation of friendship and love for the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, and for a people who, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have made their country so strong."

    Bulganin continued, "We believe that the countries we visited are peace-loving countries, and the people and governments of these countries are eager for peaceful cooperation with all countries. This is the main thing that brings us closer to them and creates the necessary conditions for friendship and cooperation. Peace is the greatest happiness of all peoples, and the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet people and the people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan is an extremely important factor in international peace. We issued joint statements as a result of our visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan. These important historical documents mark a new stage in the development of mutual relations between the Soviet Union and each of these three countries. In short, the most important result of our visit to great India, and to Burma and Afghanistan, is the further rapprochement between the Soviet Union and these countries, and the further development of the friendship and cooperation between the people of our countries."

    "But not everyone likes this. Our visit has aroused extreme resentment in some reactionary newspapers and among some social figures and government officials in Western countries, especially in Britain. To this we can only say: they don't like us talking frankly about their colonial policies, they don't like our friendship with India, Burma, and Afghanistan, but we like this friendship very much, it suits us very well. This friendship of the people strengthens the front of peace-loving countries, making it more united, and the front of peace-loving countries becomes stronger and more powerful. It will become even stronger in the future, and we believe that it will surely triumph."

    At 4:05 PM, after the mass rally ended, Bulganin and Khrushchev rode in the first convertible car, followed by the cars of other party and government leaders, and drove out of the airport, passing along Leningrad Avenue and Gorky Street. More than 500,000 Muscovites automatically gathered on the streets and squares, warmly saluting their leaders, who frequently waved to them.

    莫斯科五十万人迎接布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫归来
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在机场谈访问感想
    本报莫斯科二十一日专电　莫斯科各界代表两万多人，二十一日下午聚集在中央飞机场，迎接布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。在雪地寒风中围簇着一群群人们。几处满布白雪的地面都被人们踩得如同冰镜。人们怀着激动的心情，等待自己的敬爱的领袖的归来。人们交谈着这一个月来布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在印度、缅甸和阿富汗的访问。这次访问，对于加强和促进苏联和这些国家的友谊，对于巩固和扩大世界爱好和平阵线的深远影响，仅仅从爱好和平的人们的高兴和殖民主义者的震惊来看，就已经非常清楚了。
    三时二十分，双引擎的“○○一”号银灰色飞机慢慢地降落到人们面前。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫下了飞机，同苏联党政领导人们以及莫斯科各界代表们一一握手后，便一起登上用红布围绕的临时讲台。群众大会在苏联国歌声中开始。
    莫斯科市苏维埃主席雅斯诺夫，莫斯科工人代表“红色无产者工厂”镟工库兹明，莫斯科知识分子代表、俄罗斯联邦功勋女教师费多罗娃相继致词表示热烈欢迎，并一致感谢布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫这次对世界和平和安全事业所作的巨大贡献。
    赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁先后发表了这次访问的简短感想。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们在印度、缅甸和阿富汗这三个同我们友好的国家访问了一个月后，满怀着深刻的印象回到了这里。这些印象中最深刻的就是，我们体会到印度、缅甸和阿富汗的人民对我国、对苏联人民的那种深深的热爱和最真诚的尊重。
    在印度各个城市里，数十万、数百万的人出来欢迎我们。不论我们走到那里，我们都听到和读到朴实的、发自印度人民内心的话：印度人民和苏联人民的友谊万岁！俄国人和印度人是兄弟！
    而我们也对这些人说：是的，我们是兄弟！我们不单在和平生活的日子里是兄弟，而且在严酷考验的时候也是兄弟。我们是争取人类美好的将来的斗争中的兄弟，是争取全世界和平的斗争中的兄弟。
    在缅甸和阿富汗，这些国家的人民和领导人也是以同样一种热忱和亲切来欢迎我们的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们在印度、缅甸和阿富汗发表的演说中曾经揭露殖民者的罪恶政策。印度、缅甸和阿富汗人民都赞同我们所说的话，但是，资产阶级国家的某些人士、特别是反动报刊疯狂地仇视这些话。这种仇视是完全可以理解的。殖民制度在崩溃之中。它在亚洲已经破产了。殖民制度，这是现代人类的耻辱。我们过去这样说，将来也绝不停止反复地这样说，直到殖民者不存在的时候为止。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们同各种各样的人、同各个阶级的代表会见了。他们赞许我国的和平外交政策和苏联政府为维护和巩固世界和平而作的努力。我们有三亿七千万人口的印度人民以及缅甸和阿富汗人民作我们为世界和平而斗争的同盟者。
    印度是我们国家的一个很大的好朋友。印度和苏联、中华人民共和国一样，坚定地站在为和平而奋斗的阵地上。
    正如列宁教导我们的，印度、中国和苏联，这就是不可战胜的力量。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，我们访问印度、缅甸、阿富汗的时候，正是苏联全国准备很好地迎接苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的时候。我们以在进一步巩固苏维埃社会主义国家方面和加强我国的国际地位方面所取得的巨大的成就来迎接第二十次党代表大会。我们的任务是：尽一切努力来发展我国国民经济特别是它的基础重工业，保证农业的各部门的继续高涨，加强我国各族人民的友谊，加强我们社会主义社会全体劳动者精神上和政治上的团结。
    布尔加宁说，我们这次从各方面说来意义都很重大的访问已经一个多月了。我们看到了很多，知道了很多。我们无论到那里，都看到了对苏联的最热诚的感激，感谢它的和平外交政策，感谢它的主张各国人民友好和合作的政策。我们深信，我们到处受到的印度、缅甸和阿富汗人民热烈兴奋的欢迎，是对苏联、苏联人民的友谊和爱戴的表现，是对一个在共产党领导下使本国如此壮大的人民的友谊和爱戴的表现。
    布尔加宁接着说，我们相信，我们所访问的国家是爱好和平的国家，这些国家的人民和政府是渴望同一切国家和平合作的。这是使我们同他们接近并且为友好和合作创造必要条件的主要东西。和平是各国人民最大的幸福，而苏联人民同印度、缅甸和阿富汗人民的友好和合作，则是国际和平的极其重大的因素。我们访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的结果发表了联合声明。这些重要的历史性文件标志着苏联同这三个国家的每一个国家之间的互相关系的发展的新阶段。总之，我们这次访问伟大的印度，访问缅甸和阿富汗的最重要的结果就是苏联同这些国家进一步的接近，我们这些国家的人民的友谊和合作有了进一步的发展。
    但是，这不是所有的人都喜欢的事情。我们的访问引起了西方国家、特别是英国的某些反动报纸和某些社会人士和政府人士的极度的愤恨。对于这一点我们只能说：他们不喜欢我们坦率地谈他们的殖民政策，他们不喜欢我们同印度、缅甸、阿富汗友好，而我们十分喜欢这种友好，它对我们十分适合。这种人民的友谊加强了爱好和平国家的阵线，使它更为团结，爱好和平国家的阵线变得更加强而有力了。它将来还会更加强大，我们相信，它一定会胜利的。
    四时零五分，群众大会结束后，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫乘着第一辆敞篷的汽车，和其他党政领导人们的汽车一起先后驶出飞机场，经过列宁格勒大道和高尔基大街。五十多万莫斯科人自动汇集在街道和广场上，热情地向频频挥手的自己的领袖们致敬。
