Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The headquarters of the China Democratic League held a meeting in Beijing on the 2nd to discuss the unity and transformation of intellectuals.

The symposium was presided over by Zhang Bojun, vice chairman of the China Democratic League. Those who attended the symposium included Luo Longji, Deng Chumin, Pan Guangdan, Qian Weichang, Fei Xiaotong, Wang Jinding, and the heads of various departments of the China Democratic League headquarters. In their speeches, they unanimously agreed that intellectuals, under the cultivation and education of the Chinese Communist Party in the years since liberation, have made great contributions to the country's construction. At present, a new upsurge of socialist mass movements has arrived in rural areas across the country; the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has also undergone comprehensive planning. This new situation requires intellectuals across the country, especially senior intellectuals with academic status and specialized technology, to contribute more to socialist construction. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive investigation and study of the current work, life, and study of intellectuals and the existing problems, in order to assist the Party and the government in better uniting and transforming intellectuals.

The meeting decided to issue a notice requesting local organizations of the China Democratic League at all levels to continue to conduct in-depth investigations and research on various issues related to intellectuals, and at the same time establish close contact with senior intellectuals within and outside the League through individual visits, heart-to-heart talks, and symposiums.

The Beijing branch of the China Democratic League, in accordance with the notice from the China Democratic League headquarters, studied the issue of the unity and transformation of senior intellectuals on the evening of the 2nd. Those present put forward many positive suggestions.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and the Beijing Municipal Committee held a symposium on the issue of the unity and transformation of intellectuals at 7:00 p.m. on the 2nd. The symposium was presided over by Zhang Bojun, chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Those present included members of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in Beijing, members of the Beijing Municipal Committee, some senior intellectual members, responsible cadres of various departments of the Central Committee and the Municipal Committee, and all staff members.

At the meeting, Zhang Bojun gave detailed instructions on the issue of the unity and transformation of intellectuals. He pointed out that at present, a new socialist mass movement is unfolding vigorously in rural areas across the country; in urban areas across the country, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is also being comprehensively planned and entering a new stage. Under this new situation, on the one hand, intellectuals across the country, especially senior intellectuals, must strengthen their ideological transformation and catch up with the development of the new situation, in order to contribute more strength and wisdom to the cause of socialist construction; on the other hand, in order to further unite and transform intellectuals, a comprehensive investigation and study should be conducted on the work, study, and life of intellectuals and the existing problems.

Those who attended the symposium unanimously agreed that due to the rapid development of the objective situation, intellectuals themselves should further strengthen their ideological transformation and actively study Marxism-Leninism theory in order to better serve the country's socialist construction cause.
