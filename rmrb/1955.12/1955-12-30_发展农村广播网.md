    Develop the Rural Broadcasting Network
    With the arrival of the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, the work of developing the rural broadcasting network has been put on the agenda. The Third National Broadcasting Work Conference, held in mid-December, discussed the issue of developing the rural broadcasting network. Within seven years, the number of wired broadcasting stations in rural areas nationwide will greatly increase. Based on the speed of progress of the agricultural cooperation movement, basically all villages with agricultural cooperatives across the country will be able to hear the broadcast. Needless to say, this is an arduous task, and local leadership organs at all levels should fully care about and attach importance to this work, list it as an important project in the local overall plan, and strengthen its leadership.
    The rural broadcasting network is composed of wired broadcasting stations and radio stations distributed throughout the country, with the former as the main component. Wired broadcasting stations should be established in the vast majority of regions across the country to send broadcasts through lines to loudspeakers set up in villages and agricultural production cooperatives, so that the masses can listen to central, provincial, and county broadcasts. At the same time, radio stations should be set up in a few places where conditions are not yet sufficient or temporarily not available to establish wired broadcasting stations, so that the masses can use radios to listen to central and provincial broadcasts. This is of important political significance. Because broadcasting has unparalleled advantages such as being rapid and timely, not limited by distance, and having great mass appeal, the development of the rural broadcasting network will greatly change the current situation of rural propaganda work in our country, enabling the Party and the government to conduct propaganda to the vast majority of villages and cooperatives every day; and the vast majority of villagers and cooperatives will also be able to hear the speeches of leading personnel of the central, provincial, and county Party and government organs, and know the major events that have occurred at home and abroad in a timely manner, which will greatly strengthen the connection between the central and local Party and government leading organs and the rural working people.
    According to our country's experience in developing the rural wired broadcasting network in recent years, the level of propaganda work has been significantly improved in places where rural wired broadcasting stations have been established. It regularly conducts political and cultural education for farmers, improves mass political work in rural areas, raises farmers' political and production enthusiasm, promotes advanced experience in agricultural production, and enlivens rural cultural life. The role of the rural broadcasting network in forecasting disastrous weather to protect agricultural production is also very significant. The experience of Soviet broadcasting work fully confirms the above-mentioned advantages. For more than thirty years, from 1923 to the present, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has always attached importance to the construction of the rural broadcasting network. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the total number of loudspeakers in the Soviet Union will reach 37 million, of which 60 percent will be in rural areas. The resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on May 4, 1954, "On Measures for Further Developing Rural Radiofication," clearly pointed out that "rural radiofication is the most important tool for conducting political and cultural education for the masses and for publicizing agricultural technology."
    Now our country has the conditions to rapidly and on a large scale develop the rural broadcasting network. Since 1950, the country has begun to build rural radio stations, and in 1952, rural wired broadcasting stations were established. In the past five years, we have established nearly 25,000 radio stations and more than 800 broadcasting stations in small and medium-sized towns and rural areas, and trained more than 5,000 initially trained staff and about 10,000 radio operators. There are now more than 400,000 kilometers of telephone lines across the country that can be used. The work of building the rural broadcasting network in the Soviet Union for more than 30 years has also provided us with infinitely rich experience. All of these have become favorable conditions for the development of the rural broadcasting network in our country. Of course, what is more important is that our country has now seen a high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, profound changes have taken place in the rural economy, and the farmers' consciousness of learning politics, culture, and improving agricultural production technology has been unprecedentedly improved. Therefore, the construction of the rural broadcasting network can get full support from the farmers. The enthusiasm shown by farmers in various places in the process of building rural wired broadcasting stations has fully proved this point.
    At present, all parts of the country are making tense preparations for the development of the rural broadcasting network. In the fourth quarter of this year, more than 1,050 wired broadcasting stations will be newly built, expanded, and rebuilt across the country. The scale of station construction next year will be even larger, with more than 900 new stations alone. Because our country still lacks experience in developing the rural broadcasting network on a large scale, and the political and professional level of the personnel responsible for station construction in various places is not high, leadership organs at all levels should fully attach importance to this work and provide strong leadership. In order to ensure the speed of construction and the quality of work of the rural broadcasting network, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of relying on the masses, using existing equipment, developing in stages, gradually normalizing, and going to villages and cooperatives first, and then to courtyards and households. That is to say, in the process of building the broadcasting network, it is necessary to rely on the manpower, financial resources, and materials of the masses, and the local government should provide subsidies when necessary. It is not appropriate to demand large investments from the state; it is necessary to make full use of existing equipment such as telephone lines, and it is not appropriate to emphasize standardization, so as to delay progress and cause waste; it is necessary to first meet the needs of collective listening, and it is not appropriate to develop individual listening households too early, which will affect the spread of the broadcasting network in the local area. The rural broadcasting network is a mass undertaking, and it can only be developed by relying on the masses. In the past few years, more than 200 rural wired broadcasting stations across the country have been built almost entirely by relying on the enthusiasm of local Party and government leading organs and the masses. As long as the benefits of the rural broadcasting network and the principle that the establishment of the broadcasting network must rely on the enthusiasm of the masses are explained to the farmers clearly, and the farmers also want to listen to the radio, then it is entirely possible to spend a hundred yuan or so per village and cooperative to buy a few hundred meters of wire, two or three loudspeakers, put together some wooden poles, and mobilize farmers to participate in half a day or a day of voluntary labor when establishing a broadcasting station. Farmers fully understand that with a broadcasting station, just forecasting disastrous weather alone can save them from many losses. Therefore, it is completely worthwhile to spend some money to build a broadcasting station. Furthermore, from the local perspective, it is entirely possible to allocate a portion of the funds coordinated by the province or county to build broadcasting stations. In fact, if the county uses the rural wired broadcasting station for transmission, reducing one three-level meeting can save the representatives' food, lodging, and travel expenses, which can be used to build a broadcasting station with two or three hundred loudspeakers. We believe that in the process of developing the rural broadcasting network, as long as the above-mentioned principles are implemented, under the leadership of the local Party and government organs, on the one hand, relying closely on the masses, and on the other hand, relying on the active technical assistance of broadcasting, postal and telecommunications, and other relevant departments, any difficulties can be solved.
    Party committees at all levels should also strengthen ideological leadership over relevant cadres in the process of building the rural broadcasting network. First of all, when establishing a broadcasting station, attention should be paid to correcting the idea of ​​paying attention to form, emphasizing standardization, and looking to local people's broadcasting stations, thereby increasing the burden on the masses; after the broadcasting station starts working, it is also necessary to strengthen the leadership of the broadcasting station's propaganda business, so that the programs in each period can reflect the work intentions of the Party committee and meet the needs of the masses. In addition, it is also necessary to prevent the now relatively common tendency of liking to broadcast lengthy speeches and not wanting to broadcast literary and art programs that the masses love. In order to ensure the quality of the broadcasting station's work and the ideological level of the programs, Party committees at all levels should select cadres with a certain ideological level, familiar with rural life, and who have worked in rural areas to be responsible for the work of the broadcasting station; and on some important issues, such as funding, staffing, communication networks, and close integration with the Party's propaganda network, give clear instructions and support so that it can work smoothly. In short, whether the rural broadcasting network can be developed rapidly and on a large scale, and whether it can fully play its role in propaganda work, depends on the leadership of Party committees in various places on this work.

    发展农村广播网
    随着农业合作化运动高潮的到来，发展农村广播网的工作，已经排到日程上来了。本月中旬召开的第三次全国广播工作会议讨论了发展农村广播网的问题，七年内全国农村有线广播站将大大地发展起来，根据农业合作化运动的进展速度，全国各地凡是有农业合作社的村子基本上都将能够听到广播。不用说，这是一项艰巨的任务，地方各级领导机关应该充分关心和重视这一工作，把它列为地方全面规划的一个重要项目，并且加强对它的领导。
    农村广播网是由分布在全国的有线广播站和收音站组成的，而以前者为主。在全国绝大多数地区要建立有线广播站，通过线路把广播送到设在村里和农业生产合作社里的喇叭，以便使群众收听中央的、省的和县的广播。同时在少数条件还不够或一时不具备建立有线广播站的地方，就设立收音站，使群众利用收音机收听中央的和省的广播。这是有重要的政治意义的。由于广播具有迅速及时、不受距离的限制和巨大的群众性等无可比拟的优点，农村广播网的发展，将大大地改变我国目下农村鼓动工作的情况，使党和政府有可能在每一天向绝大部分村、社的农民进行鼓动；而绝大部分村、社的农民也有可能听到中央的、省的和县的党政机关领导人员对他们的讲话，及时地知道国内外发生的重大事件，这就大大地加强了中央、地方党政领导机关和农村劳动人民之间的联系。
    根据我国几年来发展农村有线广播网的经验，凡是建立了农村有线广播站的地方，那里的鼓动工作的水平就有显著的提高。它经常地向农民进行政治的和文化的教育，改善了农村的群众政治工作，提高了农民的政治的和生产的积极性，推广了农业生产的先进经验，以及活跃了农村的文化生活。农村广播网在预报灾害性天气以保护农业生产方面的作用也十分显著。苏联广播工作的经验完全证实了上述这些优点。从一九二三年到现在的三十多年当中，苏联共产党始终重视农村广播网的建设工作。在第六个五年计划中，全苏喇叭将达到三千七百万只，其中百分之六十就在农村。在苏共中央和苏联部长会议一九五四年五月四日公布的“关于进一步发展农村无线电化的措施”的决议中，就曾清楚地指出“农村的无线电化是对群众进行政治和文化教育以及宣传农业技术的最重要的工具。”
    现在我国已具备了迅速地和大规模地发展农村广播网的条件。从一九五○年起，全国就开始建设农村收音站，一九五二年又建立了农村有线广播站，五年来我们已建立了将近二万五千个收音站和八百多个中小城镇和农村的广播站，培养了五千多个受过初步训练的工作人员和约一万个收音员。全国现在已有四十多万公里的电话线路可以利用。苏联三十多年来建设农村广播网的工作，也给我们提供了无限丰富的经验。所有这些，都成为我国发展农村广播网的有利条件。当然，更重要的是我国现在已出现了农业合作化运动的高潮，农村经济发生了深刻的变化，农民学习政治、文化和提高农业生产技术的自觉性空前提高，因此农村广播网的建设可以得到农民的充分的支持。最近各地农民在建设农村有线广播站过程中所表现的积极性，已经充分地证明了这一点。
    目下全国各地正在紧张地准备着农村广播网的发展工作。在今年第四季度，全国新建、扩建和改建的有线广播站就有一千零五十几个。明年建站的规模还要大，仅新建的站就有九百多个。由于我国还缺乏大规模地发展农村广播网的经验，各地负责建站工作的人员的政治业务水平也不高，因此，各级领导机关应该充分重视这一工作，并且给予有力的领导。为了保证农村广播网建设的速度和工作的质量，必须坚持依靠群众，利用现有的设备，分期发展，逐步正规，先到村、社，后到院、户的方针。这就是说，在建设广播网的过程中，要依靠群众的人力、财力、物力，必要时由地方经费给予补助，不应该要求国家大量投资；要充分利用现有电话线路等设备，不应该强调正规，以致推迟进度和造成浪费；要首先满足集体收听的需要，不应该过早地发展个别听户，影响了广播网在当地的铺开。农村广播网是群众性的事业，它只有依靠群众才能得到发展。几年来全国二百多个农村有线广播站，差不多都是依靠地方党政领导机关和群众的积极性办起来的。只要把农村广播网的好处和建立广播网必须依靠群众积极性的道理向农民讲清楚，农民也想听广播，那末，在建立广播站的时候，要每村每社花百把块钱买几百公尺电线，二、三个喇叭，凑一些木杆，和动员农民参加半天一天的义务劳动，是完全可以办得到的。农民完全懂得，有了广播站，光是预报灾害性气象一项，就可以使他们少受许多损失。因此，花一些钱建立广播站是完全值得的。再从地方上说，从省或是县统筹的经费中，拨出一部分来建设广播站，是完全可以办到的。事实上，县里利用农村有线广播站作传达，少开一次三级会，省下来的代表们的食宿路费，就可以办一个有二、三百喇叭的广播站。我们相信，在发展农村广播网的过程中，只要贯彻执行上述方针，在地方党政机关的领导下，一方面紧紧依靠群众，一方面依靠广播、邮电等有关部门在技术上积极的协助，任何困难都是可以解决的。
    各级党委在建设农村广播网的过程中，还应该加强对有关干部的思想领导。首先在建立广播站的时候，要注意纠正那种讲求形式，强调正规，向地方人民广播电台看齐，因而加重群众负担的思想；在广播站开始工作之后，还要加强对广播站的宣传业务的领导，要使各时期的节目都能体现党委的工作意图和切合群众的需要。此外，还要防止现在比较普遍存在的那种喜欢播送长篇大论，而不愿意播送群众喜爱的文艺节目的偏向。为了保证广播站的工作质量和节目的思想水平，各级地方党委应该选派有一定的思想水平，熟悉农村生活，做过农村工作的干部负责广播站的工作；并且在一些重要问题上，如在经费、编制、通讯网以及和党的宣传网密切结合等问题上给予明确的指示和支持，使它能够顺利地进行工作。总之，农村广播网能否迅速地大规模地发展，以及它在宣传工作方面能否充分发挥作用，决定的关键在于各地党委对这一工作的领导。
