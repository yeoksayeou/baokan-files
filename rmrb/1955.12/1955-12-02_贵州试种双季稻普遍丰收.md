    Double-Season Rice Trial Planting Yields Universal Bumper Harvest in Guizhou
    The double-season rice trial-planted in more than ten counties in Guizhou Province, including Xingyi, Ceheng, and Wangmo, has generally achieved a bumper harvest this year. According to statistics, the yield generally increased by 20 to 30 percent compared to single-season rice. The Chishui County Farm's 27.5 mu of trial-planted double-season rice yielded an average of 456 jin per mu in the first season, with the highest reaching 591 jin; although the second season suffered severe disasters, it still yielded 300 jin per mu. Due to the high yield of double-season rice, many farmers are preparing to plant double-season rice next year. In Qingkou Township, Xingyi County, before the second-season rice has been completely harvested, many farmers have already requested to exchange grain seeds in preparation for planting double-season rice next year.
    It is estimated that 30,000 mu of double-season rice will be promoted throughout the province next year. (Wang Qinghai)

    贵州试种双季稻普遍丰收
    贵州省兴义、册亨、望谟等十余县今年试种的双季稻普遍获得丰收。据统计，一般较单季稻增产百分之二十到三十。赤水县农场试种的二十七亩半双季稻，头一季每亩平均收四百五十六斤，最高的达五百九十一斤；第二季虽受严重灾害，每亩仍可收三百斤。由于双季稻的产量高，很多农民纷纷准备明年种植双季稻。兴义县箐口乡第二季稻尚未收完，已有很多农民要求换谷种，准备明年种双季稻。
    预计明年全省将推广三万亩双季稻。（王清海）
