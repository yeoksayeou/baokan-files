    Farmers Need More and Better New-Style Production Tools
    Zhang Zuozhou, Second Secretary of the CPC Xinhua County Committee
    By this autumn, Xinhua County, Hunan Province, has developed 896 agricultural production cooperatives, all of which have been very successful. This winter, the county party committee plans to establish another 1,674 cooperatives. By next winter, the number of farmer households participating in cooperatives will reach approximately 80% of the total, achieving basic collectivization throughout the county. With the development of the cooperative movement, significant changes are taking place in the production and lives of farmers, and their purchasing power is also continuously increasing.
    Taking Yushang Township as an example, the average yield of rice per mu in 1952 was over 400 jin. This year, despite suffering from a 62-day drought, the rice yield per mu still reached 485 jin. This is mainly because six cooperatives were established throughout the township this year. In 1953, there were 323 grain-deficient households in the township, and the state supplied them with 100,000 jin of grain. However, the 165 surplus grain households only sold 50,000 jin of grain. This year, the number of grain-deficient households has decreased to 85, requiring the state to supply only a little over 27,000 jin of grain. Meanwhile, the number of surplus grain households has increased to 399, selling a total of over 150,000 jin of surplus grain. This change in grain purchase and sales figures not only demonstrates the enormous growth in the township's purchasing power but also indicates that a significant portion of this purchasing power will shift from grain to other areas. This means that farmers not only need more and better living materials but also urgently require more and newer means of production, especially various new-style agricultural implements and small agricultural machines with higher efficiency. This autumn, the Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative bought two double-wheeled double-furrow plows. The results of using them showed that their efficiency was two and a half times faster than old-style plows. This year, the Liaoyuan Fifth Branch purchased a rice thresher on credit. Using this machine, each laborer can thresh 5,000 jin of rice per day, whereas using old-style threshing barrels, four people can only thresh 1,000 jin per day. Using a rice thresher allows for careful and thorough threshing, increasing the harvest. Therefore, all six cooperatives in the township welcome these new agricultural implements and plan to purchase double-wheeled double-furrow plows, rice threshers, and sprayers next year.
    The Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture awarded a sweet potato slicing machine to the Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative this year. A woman using this machine can slice 1,000 jin of sweet potato shreds a day, which is more than ten times faster than manual operation. Now, the women in each cooperative are eager to buy this machine to slice sweet potatoes, and the six cooperatives are requesting to buy ten units. However, the sweet potato slicing machine cannot be bought in Xinhua County. According to our preliminary calculations, the county needs 10,000 rice threshers, 187 double-wheeled double-furrow plows next year, in addition to a large number of sprayers, grass cutters, and sweet potato slicing machines. But so far, the county supply and marketing cooperative does not have these production tools.
    The CPC Xinhua County Committee has decided to take measures to help the county agricultural machinery factory trial-produce small new-style agricultural implements and improved agricultural implements to partially meet the needs of farmers, but this is still not enough. At present, the countryside, where the cooperative movement is flourishing, urgently hopes that local industrial departments will conduct in-depth investigations into the needs of farmers and produce and supply more new-style agricultural implements and industrial products that farmers welcome.

    农民需要更多更好的新式生产工具
    中共新化县委第二书记　张作舟
    湖南省新化县的农业生产合作社到今年秋季已发展到八百九十六个社，这些社都办得很成功。今年冬天县委计划再办一千六百七十四个社，到明年冬天，全县入社农户将达到总农户的百分之八十左右，达到全县基本合作化。随着合作化运动的发展，农民的生产和生活正在发生很大的变化，购买力也在不断提高。
    以上田乡为例，这个乡一九五二年水稻每亩平均产量是四百多斤，今年虽然受了六十二天的旱灾，水稻每亩产量仍然达到四百八十五斤。这主要是因为今年全乡办起了六个合作社。一九五三年，全乡有三百二十三户缺粮户，国家向他们供应了十万斤粮食；而一百六十五户余粮户也只卖出了五万斤粮食。今年，缺粮户已经减少到八十五户，只要国家供应二万七千多斤粮食；而余粮户已经增加到三百九十九户，共卖出了十五万多斤余粮。这个粮食购销数字的变化，不仅说明全乡的购买力的巨大增长，而且说明了这种购买力的很大一部分将由粮食方面转向其他方面。这就是说，农民们不仅需要更多更好的生活资料，也更迫切需要更多更新式的生产资料，特别是效率更高的各种新式农具和小型农业机器。燎原农业生产合作社，今年秋天买回了两部双轮双铧犁，使用的结果，效率比旧式犁要快两倍半。燎原第五分社今年赊购了一部打稻机，用这部机器打稻，每个劳动力每天可打五千斤稻谷；而使用旧式扮桶，四个人一天才能打一千斤。用打稻机打稻，可以细收细打，增加收获量。因此，全乡六个合作社都很欢迎这些新农具，都计划在明年添购双轮双铧犁、打稻机和喷雾器。
    湖南省农业厅今年奖给燎原农业生产合作社一部甘薯刨丝机。一个妇女使用这部机器一天就可刨薯丝一千斤，比手工操作要快十倍多。现在各个社里的妇女们迫切要买这种机子切甘薯，六个社要求买十部。可是在新化县就买不到甘薯刨丝机。根据我们的初步计算，全县明年需要打稻机一万部，双轮双铧犁一百八十七部，此外还需要大量的喷雾器、切草机、甘薯刨丝机。但到目前为止，县供销合作社还没有这些生产工具。
    中共新化县委已经决定采取措施，帮助县农具厂试制小型新式农具和改良农具，以便部分地满足农民的要求，但是这还是不够的；目前合作化运动蓬勃开展的农村，迫切希望地方工业部门，深入农村调查农民的需要，多多生产和供应农民所欢迎的新式农具和工业品。
