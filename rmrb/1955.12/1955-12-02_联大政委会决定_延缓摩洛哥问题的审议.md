    Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 29th - The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly considered the Moroccan question on November 28th, which was requested to be included in the agenda by fifteen Asian and African countries. Thirty-one countries, including Asian and African countries, put forward a proposal in the committee suggesting that further consideration of the Moroccan question be postponed, taking into account the upcoming negotiations between France and Morocco. This proposal was adopted with forty-nine votes in favor, with no country voting against it. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Australia, which expressed disagreement with the UN's right to consider colonial issues, abstained from the vote.
    Representatives from Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, and Iraq spoke during the discussion, explaining their reasons for suggesting the postponement of the discussion on the Moroccan question. They pointed out that there had been some changes in France's attitude towards the Moroccan question, especially regarding the fact that Sultan Yusuf was allowed to return to Morocco. Representatives from Arab countries expressed hope that France would abandon violent means and that the negotiations between France and Morocco would produce positive results. Soviet representative Malik said in his speech that the Soviet people's position is to morally support and sympathize with the aspirations of all peoples for national liberation. The Soviet delegation, considering that the thirty-one-nation proposal was put forward by delegations including those countries that raised the Moroccan question to the General Assembly and are directly related to the resolution of this issue, voted in favor of this proposal. The Soviet delegation supports this suggestion aimed at resolving the Moroccan question through peaceful means.
    At the end of the meeting, the committee decided that the next meeting would begin with simultaneous consideration of the disarmament issue and the Soviet proposal on "measures for further easing international tensions and developing international cooperation."

    联大政委会决定
    延缓摩洛哥问题的审议
    新华社据塔斯社纽约二十九日讯　联合国大会政治委员会十一月二十八日审议了十五个亚洲和非洲国家要求列入议程的摩洛哥问题。包括亚洲和非洲国家在内的三十一个国家在委员会上提出一项提案，提案考虑到法国和摩洛哥将举行谈判，建议延缓关于摩洛哥问题的进一步审议。这项提案以四十九票赞成获得通过，没有国家投反对票。对于联合国有权考虑殖民地问题表示异议的英国、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡和澳大利亚在表决中弃权。
    叙利亚、埃及、黎巴嫩和伊拉克的代表在讨论过程中发言说明他们建议延缓关于摩洛哥问题的讨论的理由。他们指出，法国对摩洛哥问题的态度有某些改变，特别是关于让苏丹优素福回到摩洛哥这一事实。阿拉伯国家的代表们表示希望，法国放弃暴力手段，法国和摩洛哥之间的谈判将产生积极的结果。苏联代表马立克在发言中说，苏联人民的立场是在道义上支持和同情各国人民争取民族解放的愿望。苏联代表团考虑到三十一国提案是由包括向大会提出摩洛哥问题而且同解决这个问题直接有关的那些国家在内的代表团提出的，所以苏联代表团投票赞成这个提案。苏联代表团支持以通过和平方式解决摩洛哥问题为目的的这种建议。
    在会议结束时，委员会决定下次会议开始同时审议裁军问题和苏联提出的“关于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的措施”的建议。
