Respected Premier Grotewohl, Respected Ambassador, Comrades and Friends:

Premier Grotewohl and all the comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic will soon be leaving our country. During their short stay in our country, they visited our cities, villages, factories, schools, government offices, and military units, and had extensive contacts with representatives from all walks of life. The Chinese people, treating them like their own relatives, expressed warm welcome and deep friendship to them. During this period, our two countries also held sincere and friendly talks, reaching a consensus on further developing and strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, on the international situation, and on other issues related to our common interests. As a result of the talks, the two sides concluded the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's of Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, and also signed the Sino-German Cultural Cooperation Agreement and the Sino-German Agreement on Cooperation in Plant Quarantine and Prevention and Control of Crop Diseases and Insect Pests. This is a new and significant development in the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, following the Sino-German Premiers' Joint Communiqué of July 1954. It can be seen that the growth of our unity and friendship will further promote the socialist construction of our two countries, strengthen the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union, and will certainly play a significant role in defending world peace.

Premier, your friendly visit and that of the delegation you lead have brought the brotherly friendship of the people of the German Democratic Republic to the Chinese people. At the same time, we believe that during your visit, you have personally witnessed and experienced the deep concern and friendly wishes of the Chinese people for the German people. The brotherly assistance and support given by the German Democratic Republic to the Chinese people have inspired the Chinese people's confidence and determination to build socialism and to fight for the cause of world peace.

Premier, as you are about to leave China, please allow me to once again express our heartfelt gratitude to you, and through you, to the people of the German Democratic Republic. The Chinese people sincerely thank them for their assistance and support to us. At the same time, we will, at all times, fully support the just struggle of the German people for the establishment of a European collective security system and the peaceful reunification of Germany.

Finally, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, I sincerely congratulate the government and people of the German Democratic Republic on achieving greater and more brilliant achievements in socialist construction and in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Let us drink to:

The close unity and brotherly friendship between the people of the People's Republic of China and the people of the German Democratic Republic,

To the health of President Wilhelm Pieck,

To the health of Premier Grotewohl and the health of all comrades of the delegation,

To the increasing strength and development of the world's forces of peace, democracy, and socialism!

    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的总理同志，敬爱的大使同志，同志们和朋友们：
    格罗提渥总理同志和德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志们很快就要离开我国了。他们在我们国家逗留的短短时间里，访问了我们的城市、农村、工厂、学校、机关、部队，同各方面的代表人物进行了广泛的接触。我国人民像对待自己的亲人一样，对他们表示了热烈的欢迎和深厚的友谊。在这期间，我们两国间还进行了真诚友好的会谈，就进一步发展和加强我们两国间的友好合作关系，就国际局势以及其它有关我们两国的共同利益的问题，取得了一致的意见。会谈结果，双方缔结了中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国友好合作条约，还签订了中德文化合作协定和中德关于植物检疫和防治农作物病虫害合作的协定。这是继一九五四年七月中德两国总理会谈公报之后，两国友好合作关系新的重大的发展。人们可以看到，我们这种团结和友谊的增长，必将进一步推进我们两国的社会主义建设，加强以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义力量，对保卫世界和平也一定会发生重大的作用。
    总理同志，你和你领导的代表团的友好访问给中国人民带来了德意志民主共和国人民的兄弟友谊。同时我们相信，在你访问的过程中，你也亲眼看到和亲身体会到中国人民对德意志人民的深切关怀和友好愿望。德意志民主共和国给予中国人民的兄弟般的帮助和支持，鼓舞了中国人民建设社会主义和为世界和平事业而斗争的信心和决心。
    总理同志，在你就要离开中国的时候，请允许我再一次向你，并且通过你，向德意志民主共和国人民表达我们的心意，中国人民衷心地感谢他们对我们的援助和支持，同时不论在什么时候，我们也都将全力支持德意志人民为建立欧洲集体安全和解决德意志和平统一问题的正义斗争。
    最后，我谨代表中国政府和人民衷心地祝贺德意志民主共和国政府和人民在社会主义建设和和平统一自己祖国的斗争中获得更大的更光辉的成就。
    让我们为：
    中华人民共和国人民和德意志民主共和国人民的亲密团结和兄弟友谊，
    为威廉·皮克总统的健康，
    为格罗提渥总理同志的健康和代表团全体同志们的健康，
    为世界和平民主社会主义力量的日益强大和发展干杯！
