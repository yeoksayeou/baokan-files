For a long time, the forestry industry departments in Heilongjiang Province have had a major problem: they can never complete the task of producing mine props (wooden pillars used in mine shafts). This task accounts for a large proportion of the timber felling volume, and to complete it, it is often necessary to fell many small-diameter trees, which presents some practical difficulties. However, are these difficulties fundamentally insurmountable? The experience of the Shangganling Forestry Bureau and other units has already answered in the negative.

The Shangganling Forestry Bureau, under the Yichun Forestry Administration Bureau, was also unable to complete the task of producing mine props in the past. However, a large number of treetop wood suitable for making mine props was discarded during felling. One logging site discarded eight cubic meters of timber suitable for making mine props per hectare of forest land. This year, the Shangganling Forestry Bureau strengthened felling management and educated loggers to make as much use of treetop wood as possible to make mine props, and thus completed the mine prop production task. So far, out of the more than 16,000 cubic meters of mine props produced, 12,000 cubic meters were made from treetop wood. After the Friendship Forestry Bureau's tractor team implemented the method of using tractors to collect treetop wood, it collected more than 10,000 cubic meters of treetop wood in one year, ensuring the completion of the mine prop production task. The Friendship Forestry Bureau now has nine logging sites, and after clearing more than 2,600 hectares of past felling sites, it cleared out 25,000 cubic meters of timber suitable for making mine props.

These facts fully demonstrate that the reason for not being able to complete the mine prop production task in the past was mainly that the treetop wood suitable for making mine props was discarded. Especially in the forestry bureaus that implement mechanized production, some people shout empty slogans about not being able to complete the mine prop production task, but are unwilling to use tractors to collect small wood, for the sole reason that they "are afraid of the trouble." Some forestry bureaus discard treetop wood and use the method of felling young forests to complete the mine prop production task.

The staff of these units should change their past erroneous practices, cherish the country's timber resources, make full use of treetop wood, and ensure the completion of the mine prop production task.

    矿柱生产任务到底能否完成
    赫重运
    黑龙江省森林工业部门很久以来存在一个大问题：总是完不成生产矿柱（矿坑中使用的木柱）的任务。这个任务在木材采伐量中占很大的比重，要完成它，常常要采伐很多小径的树木，是有一些实际困难的。但是，这些困难是不是根本不可克服的呢？上甘岭森林工业局和其他单位的经验，已经作了否定的回答。
    伊春森林工业管理局所属的上甘岭森林工业局过去也是不能完成生产矿柱的任务。但是，在采伐中，大量造矿柱用的梢头木被扔掉了。有一个伐木场在一公顷的林地上就扔掉了八立方公尺可造矿柱的木材。今年，上甘岭森林工业局加强了采伐管理，教育伐木工人尽量利用梢头木做矿柱，就完成了矿柱生产任务。到目前为止，制成的一万六千多立方公尺的矿柱当中，有一万二千立方公尺是用梢头木做的。友好森林工业局拖拉机队从实行拖拉机集聚梢头木的办法以后，一年来收集梢头木一万立方公尺以上，保证了矿柱生产任务的完成。友好森林工业局现在有九个伐木场，把过去的采伐迹地清理了二千六百多公顷，就清理出可造矿柱的木材二万五千立方公尺。
    这些事实充分说明过去完不成矿柱生产任务的原因，主要是把可造矿柱的梢头木扔掉了。特别是在实行机械化生产的森林工业局中，有些人空喊完不成矿柱生产任务，但是不愿意用拖拉机收集小木头，理由只有一个：“怕费事”。有的森林工业局把梢头木扔掉，而用采伐幼林的办法来完成矿柱生产任务。
    这些单位的工作人员应该改变过去的错误做法，珍惜国家的木材资源，充分利用梢头木，保证矿柱生产的任务的完成。
