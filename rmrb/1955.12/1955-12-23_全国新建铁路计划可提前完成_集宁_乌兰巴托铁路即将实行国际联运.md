Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd. Minister of Railways Teng Tai-yuan told our reporter today: The national railway trunk lines planned for construction during the first Five-Year Plan are certain to be completed ahead of schedule.

Teng Tai-yuan said that the state originally stipulated that 4,084 kilometers of new railways should be built nationwide during the first Five-Year Plan. From 1953 to the end of November this year, 2,460 kilometers of new railways have already been laid nationwide. It is preliminarily estimated that some kilometers of track can be laid again by the end of this year. In this way, only over 1,400 kilometers of the new railways stipulated to be built within five years under the first Five-Year Plan will remain. Teng Tai-yuan said that in the past three years, the broad masses of workers, railway soldiers, and engineering and technical personnel participating in the construction of new railways, under the guidance and help of Soviet experts, have brought into full play their high level of enthusiasm and creativity, thus smoothly completing the state-stipulated plan for constructing new railways, and have accumulated certain construction experience. If the broad masses of workers, railway soldiers, and engineering and technical personnel participating in the construction of new railways make another effort in 1956, they can not only build the remaining more than 1,400 kilometers, but also possibly build some more new railways.

Teng Tai-yuan said that the early completion of the national new railway five-year plan is of great significance for accelerating the country's industrialization and the agricultural cooperation movement. For example, after the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was opened to traffic ahead of schedule, the exchange of goods and materials between the southwestern region and all parts of the country will become more active as a result. Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," has always had a lot of surplus grain, but until now, due to the limitations of the transportation capacity of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Sichuan's surplus grain still cannot be completely transported out. After the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is fully open, the transportation of Sichuan grain out of the province will no longer be a problem. The original plan for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was to reach the Yumen oil mining area in 1957. If it can be laid to Yumen more than a year earlier, a lot more oil can be transported out. Moreover, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway can be laid several hundred kilometers further west from Yumen during the first Five-Year Plan period.

Teng Tai-yuan also said that due to the early completion of the originally planned new railways, the state can also free up part of its strength to build some new railways. For example, the Neijiang-Kunming Railway in Sichuan Province and the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway from Sichuan to Guizhou, which were originally planned to be built during the second Five-Year Plan, can be started during the first Five-Year Plan period.

Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd. Minister of Railways of the People's Republic of China, Teng Tai-yuan, held a press conference in Beijing today to introduce the situation and political and economic significance of the Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway, which is about to hold an international through transport ceremony.

Teng Tai-yuan said that the Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway has been completed on schedule, and the various preparations for organizing international through transport have been roughly completed. The track-laying ceremony for the railways of China and Mongolia and the official opening ceremony for international through transport will be held in early January next year. In the future, passenger trains will run twice a week between Beijing and Ulaanbaatar, and the through transport of goods between China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia will begin on January 1st next year. Teng Tai-yuan said that this means a further increase in the strength of the peaceful and democratic socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; the unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia have been further developed and consolidated. He said: The opening of this railway will be more conducive to economic and cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and will be beneficial to China's foreign trade.

Reporters from Beijing newspapers and reporters stationed in Beijing from eleven countries, including the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, attended today's press conference. Minister Teng Tai-yuan also answered various questions raised by reporters from various countries concerning this railway at the reception today.

### 全国新建铁路计划可提前完成  集宁——乌兰巴托铁路即将实行国际联运

    全国新建铁路计划可提前完成
    集宁——乌兰巴托铁路即将实行国际联运
    新华社二十二日讯　铁道部部长滕代远今天对本社记者说：国家规定在第一个五年计划期间新建的铁路干线，有把握提前完成。
    滕代远说，国家原来规定在第一个五年计划期间，全国要修筑新的铁路线四千零八十四公里。从一九五三年到今年十一月底，全国已经铺设了二千四百六十公里新铁路。初步预计到今年年底，还可以再铺轨若干公里。这样，第一个五年计划规定在五年内修建的新铁路就只剩下一千四百多公里了。滕代远说，过去的三年中，参加建设新铁路线的广大职工、铁道兵和工程技术人员，在苏联专家的指导和帮助下，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，因而顺利地完成了国家规定的修建新铁路线的计划，并且积累了一定的建设经验。参加建设新铁路的广大职工、铁道兵和工程技术人员，如果在一九五六年内再加一把劲，不仅可以修好剩下的一千四百多公里，而且还有可能再多修一些新铁路。
    滕代远说，全国新建铁路五年计划的提前完成，对于加快国家工业化速度和农业合作化运动都有非常重要的意义。譬如，宝成铁路提前全线通车以后，西南地区和全国各地的物资交流因此将更加活跃。号称“天府之国”的四川，一向余粮很多，但直到现在为止，因为受长江上游运输力量的限制，四川余粮仍然不能全部运出来。宝成铁路全线畅通后，川粮外运就不成问题了。兰新铁路原定计划在一九五七年才修到玉门油矿区。如果提前一年多铺到玉门，就可以多运出不少石油。而且兰新铁路在第一个五年计划期内可以从玉门向西再多铺几百公里。
    滕代远还说，由于原定新建铁路计划的提前完成，国家还可以腾出一部分力量再修建一些新的铁路。如原定在第二个五年计划中修建的四川内江到云南昆明的铁路，和四川到贵州的川黔铁路等，都可以提前在第一个五年计划期间开工兴建。
    据新华社二十二日讯　中华人民共和国铁道部部长滕代远今天在北京举行记者招待会，介绍了即将举行国际联运通车典礼的集宁—乌兰巴托铁路的情况和政治经济意义。
    滕代远说，集宁—乌兰巴托铁路已按期修建完成，组织国际联运的各项准备工作已大致就绪，明年一月初就要举行中、蒙两国铁路的接轨典礼和国际联运正式通车典礼。以后，北京和乌兰巴托间每星期将开行两次对开旅客列车，中、苏、蒙三国之间的货物联运工作将从明年一月一日开始办理。滕代远说，这件事意味着以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营力量的进一步增长；中、苏、蒙三国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结进一步地发展和巩固。他说：这条铁路通车联运将更有利于中国同苏联及各人民民主国家之间经济和文化交流，有利于中国的对外贸易。
    参加今天记者招待会的有北京各报记者，以及苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等十一个国家驻北京的记者。滕代远部长今天在招待会上还回答了各国记者所提的有关这条铁路的各项问题。
