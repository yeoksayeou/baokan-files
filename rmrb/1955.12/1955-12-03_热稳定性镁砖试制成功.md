    Thermal Stability Magnesia Brick Successfully Trial-Produced
    The refractory materials workshop of Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant has successfully trial-produced a new product, thermal stability magnesia brick, which is unprecedented in the country. Using magnesia bricks to build open-hearth steelmaking furnaces can extend the life of the furnace and reduce downtime for repairs. Each furnace can produce 1,100 to 1,200 heats of steel, increasing steel production by five to six times compared to using silica bricks. At the same time, it can more accurately control the composition of the alkaline slag and reduce the consumption of refractory materials and fuel, creating conditions for the application of new steelmaking technologies.
    In the past, open-hearth steelmaking furnaces were built with silica bricks. Due to the low refractoriness and poor resistance to rapid heating and cooling of silica bricks, they could not withstand the erosion of alkaline oxides in the open-hearth flame, and generally required repairs after only 200 heats. In mid-September, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, based on the suggestions made by Soviet expert Academician Barkin at a meeting of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, began trial production in the refractory materials workshop of Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant. Engineer Zhou Zong and other personnel, referring to Soviet refractory materials data and combining it with on-site raw materials, conducted detailed analysis and research. They finally succeeded in the trial production at the end of September and began mass production in November. (Our correspondent in Chongqing)

    热稳定性镁砖试制成功
    重庆第一钢铁厂耐火材料车间试制全国未有的新产品热稳定性镁砖成功。使用镁砖砌炼钢平炉，可以延长炉子的寿命，减少停炉修理时间，每次可炼一千一百到一千二百炉钢，使钢的产量比原来用矽砖砌炼钢平炉提高五倍到六倍，同时更能准确地控制碱性渣液的成份，降低耐火材料和燃料的消耗，为运用新的炼钢技术创造了条件。
    过去，炼钢平炉是用矽砖砌成的。由于矽砖耐火度低，耐急冷急热性能差，不能承受平炉火焰中碱性氧化物的侵蚀，一般仅能炼到两百炉就要停工修理。九月中旬，重庆钢铁公司根据苏联专家巴尔金院士在中央重工业部会议上提出的建议，开始在重庆第一钢铁厂耐火材料车间进行试制。工程师周宗和其他人员参照苏联耐火材料资料结合现场使用原料进行详细分析研究，终于在九月底试制成功，十一月开始大量生产。（本报驻重庆记者）
