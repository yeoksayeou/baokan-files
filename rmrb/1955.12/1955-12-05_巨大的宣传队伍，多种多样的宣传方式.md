A huge propaganda team, diverse propaganda methods
Fang Qing

The Ning'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Heilongjiang Province, in order to raise the socialist consciousness of the county's peasants and promote the already basically formed upsurge of agricultural cooperation towards a deeper and broader direction, emphasized at the county, district, and village three-level cadre meeting: a strong propaganda team must be organized to vigorously carry out socialist propaganda. Afterwards, each district convened meetings of village cadres, propagandists, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, non-party activists to convey the spirit of this instruction from the County Party Committee, and to study the organization of propaganda teams and training classes. Then, each village, based on its specific situation, organized twenty to thirty or fifty to sixty active figures from various fields, such as village cadres, cooperative cadres, propagandists, labor models, production experts, revolutionary disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, primary school teachers, upper primary school graduates, junior high school graduates, and folk artists. They held training classes for three or four days to deeply study Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, and summarized the superiority of the cooperative in their own village as propaganda material. A total of 16,000 people were mobilized throughout the county, 118 lecture groups and many propaganda groups were formed, and many amateur theatrical troupes, with the Party branch as the leadership core, launched large-scale propaganda activities. After the Party's policies met directly with the masses, the whole county immediately launched a surge of joining cooperatives. Within a month, 11,000 farming households signed up to join the cooperatives. In Langang District, the number of farming households joining cooperatives increased from 28 percent of the total number of farming households to 78 percent.

In this propaganda campaign, the propaganda team's activities were diverse. Langang District summarized sixteen propaganda methods. In addition to generally speaking about the Party's collectivization policy and the Five-Year Plan, the propaganda was mainly aimed at the different ideological concerns of the target audience, and specific explanations were given. Cadres and propagandists of the advanced agricultural producers' cooperative in Tuanshanzi used the development process of their own cooperative as a living teaching material, vividly educating the peasants about the prospects of agricultural collectivization. The farmers in this village who had not joined the cooperative saw their own future and the prospects of collectivization, and five cooperatives were established at once. The main concern that prevented women in Jiefang Village from joining the cooperative was that they had no way to take care of their children. After the Party branch secretary of Gangyao Village learned about this, he sent female cooperative member Xu Shumin to do propaganda. Xu Shumin talked about her own experience: she had five children, all of whom were looked after by the old women in the childcare group, and sometimes older children were used to take care of younger children, so that she had time to work in the fields, and she worked 170 workdays in the cooperative in a year. After this propaganda, more than fifty women from Jiefang Village joined the cooperative. Shaoguo Village used charts and propaganda paintings to show the advantages of the two old cooperatives in production, and at the same time, it showed the production situation of mutual aid teams and individual households, so that people could see at a glance what the benefits of the cooperative were. As a result, the number of farming households joining the cooperative in this village increased from 56 to 124.

On November 2, the Ning'an County Party Committee held an enlarged meeting. At the meeting, in addition to conveying the spirit of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee (Enlarged) Plenary Session and arranging some major tasks, the experience of propaganda work was also summarized, and it was decided to vigorously promote these experiences, requiring the whole county to organize a 20,000-person urban and rural propaganda team to continue to carry out socialist propaganda and education to the peasants.

The propaganda experience of Ning'an County is worth learning from, but some people say, "The masses' enthusiasm has already been aroused, so there is no need for further propaganda." Those who say this regard in-depth ideological education as a mere slogan for mobilization. They do not understand that only by publicizing the Party's policies in a way that is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people can we guarantee the consolidation and development of the cooperative movement and run the already organized cooperatives well. Ning'an County did not stop propaganda after pushing the movement to a climax, but guided the propaganda work towards more detail and depth, thus achieving greater results.

Some people also say, "It is certainly good to do more propaganda, but there are no propagandists. To do propaganda, people must come, and cultural troupes must come." This statement is also negated by the facts in Ning'an County. Ning'an County widely mobilized Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, cadres, and activists to do propaganda work. Almost one in ten farmers in the county is a propagandist. This is a large-scale way of working, a way of working that both boldly mobilizes the masses and strengthens leadership with the Party's village branch as the core, and it is in line with the current agricultural cooperation movement.

Political work is the lifeline of all economic work, and at no time should we neglect political and ideological education, especially in the current agricultural cooperation movement.

    巨大的宣传队伍，多种多样的宣传方式
    方青
    黑龙江省宁安县县委为了提高全县农民群众的社会主义觉悟，促进目前已经基本形成的农业合作化新高潮向着更深广的方向发展，在召开县、区、村三级干部会议的时候，强调指出：必须组织一支力量雄厚的宣传队伍，大张旗鼓地进行社会主义宣传。之后，各区就分别召开了村干部、宣传员、党员、团员、非党积极分子会议，传达县委这一指示的精神，研究了宣传队伍组织问题和训练班问题。接着，各村根据具体情况，组织了村干部、社干部、宣传员、劳动模范、生产能手、革命残废军人、转业军人、小学教师、高小毕业生、初中毕业生以及民间艺人等各方面的活动人物二、三十人至五、六十人，办了三、四天的训练班，深入学习毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，党的七届六中全会（扩大）决议，并且总结了本村合作社的优越性，作为宣传资料。全县共动员了一万六千人，成立了一百一十八个演讲团和许多宣传组，动员了许多业余剧团以支部为领导核心，展开了大规模的宣传活动。党的政策直接和群众见面以后，全县立刻展开了一个入社热潮，一个月以内，就有一万一千农户报名入社。兰岗区的入社农户，由占总农户的百分之二十八，增加到百分之七十八。
    在这一次宣传中，宣传队伍的活动方式是多种多样的，兰岗区就总结了十六种宣传方式。除一般地讲党的合作化政策、五年计划外，主要针对宣传对象的不同的思想顾虑，进行具体宣传解释。团山子高级形式的农业生产合作社的干部、宣传员就是把本社的发展过程作为活的教材，生动地向农民作了农业集体化的远景教育。这个村没有入社的农民看到了自己的前途，看到了集体化的远景，一次就建立起五个合作社。解放村妇女之所以迟迟没有入社，最主要的顾虑是孩子没法安置。这件事情被缸窑村党支部书记知道以后，便派女社员徐淑敏去作宣传。徐淑敏这样讲自己的经历：自己有五个孩子，都交给带孩子组的老太太看管，有时也采取大孩子看管小孩子的办法，这样就使自己有时间下地，一年就在社里作了一百七十个劳动日。经过这次宣传，解放村有五十多户的妇女入了社。烧锅村是用图表和宣传画的形式，把两个老社在生产上所表现的优越性画出来，同时把互助组、单干户的生产情况也画出来，使人一眼可以看出合作社有些什么好处。这样，这个村入社农户就由五十六户增加到一百二十四户。
    十一月二日，宁安县委召开了扩大会议，会上传达了黑龙江省委全会（扩大）的精神，对一些重大工作作了布置之外，还总结了宣传工作的经验，决定大力推广这些经验，要求全县组织两万人的城乡宣传队伍，向农民群众继续进行社会主义宣传教育。
    宁安县的宣传经验是值得学习的，但是有人说：“群众劲头已经起来了，就不用再宣传了。”说这种话的人是把深入的思想教育看成了单纯的鼓动口号，他们不懂得只有把党的政策宣传得深入人心，才能保证合作化运动巩固地发展，才能把已经组织起来的合作社办好。宁安县就是把运动推向高潮之后，没有停止宣传，而把宣传工作更加导向细致和深入，这样，就取得了更大的效果。
    也有人说：“多宣传宣传当然好，就是没有宣传人员，要宣传就得来人，来文工团。”这种说法也被宁安县的事实所否定了。宁安县广泛地发动党员、团员、干部和积极分子做宣传工作，全县几乎每十个农民当中就有一个宣传员。这是一种大规模的工作方式，是一种既放手发动群众又以党的村支部为核心加强领导的工作方式，是符合当前农业合作化运动的。
    政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线，任何时候都不允许忽视政治思想教育，在目前农业合作化运动中尤其这样。
