    I want to Contribute Everything to the Realization of the Great Communist Ideal
    Ouyang Yuqian
    I am an extremely ordinary drama worker. Although I have a heart that pursues truth, because I am deeply influenced by the old culture and lack a strong fighting spirit, I have always only had a fantasy-like longing for communism. I have not been able to devote my whole life to the fiery struggle, and gradually recognize the truth from the struggle.
    I have been engaged in the drama movement for more than forty years (from adulthood to the present, I have supported myself and have not engaged in any other profit-making activities). In the initial stage (1907-1917), I once hung up the signboard of social education to deal with feudal forces; after performing Peking Opera, I tended towards aestheticism. I also made various attempts to reform the old opera, ran into many obstacles, but did not find the right path, nor did I receive any sympathetic support; I also engaged in the "Love Beauty Drama" movement, participated in the Shanghai Drama Association and the South China Society, and ran my own theater troupe, with very little success; I wrote many scripts, but none could be said to be truly successful. My political attitude was initially against foreign rule, and then against the imperial system, warlords, and traitors, but it was only in my mind and talked about, without concrete and clear actions. I was increasingly disgusted with the arrogance and corruption of the Kuomintang's new dignitaries in the early years of the Republic of China; when Sun Yat-sen shouted the slogan of overthrowing imperialism, I sympathized with the national revolution he advocated, and also thought that his "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" was correct. After the "Northern Expedition," thinking that there might be some solutions, I gave up my stage life and wanted to devote myself to the revolutionary cause. Chiang Kai-shek's extreme reaction gave me a great shock. For a while, I didn't know what to do, and I couldn't help but feel sentimental—I didn't want to join a troupe to perform some boring plays, and I had no way to make a living, so I had to change my career to film, shooting two silent films, neither of which was satisfactory, and I felt that it was not easy to cooperate with the bosses; later, I went to Guangdong for three years and ran a drama research institute. At that time, Shanghai was organizing the League of Left-Wing Social Scientists and the League of Left-Wing Dramatists and other groups. I thought I was unwilling to lag behind. But at that time, my thinking was quite chaotic, as can be seen from the articles I wrote at that time: I did not study progressive literary and artistic theories properly, and only relied on my own narrow knowledge and opinions to stumble around.
    The Guangdong Drama Research Institute was dissolved, and I returned to Shanghai, just in time for the "January 28th" Incident. After that, my thinking underwent a significant change: when the "May 30th" Massacre occurred, Zhang Jian of Nantong wrote an article opposing the workers' movement and the student movement in Shanghai. I thought he was very wrong, but I didn't understand why he would do that. Recalling what I saw and heard during the "January 28th" Incident, reminded me of Zhang Jian's article, and I couldn't help but think of the fact that the gentry of Changsha asked Japanese warships to bombard the city in order to deal with the Communist Party. Only then did I believe that the saying that class consciousness surpasses national consciousness was completely correct. Our nineteen-scene tableau "Don't Forget" (written about the "January 28th" Songhu War and the Lytton Commission) was written during that period. I began to recognize the qualities of the working class, and I also read some documents published by the Communist Party of China. I then said with certainty: "Only the Communist Party of China can save China." But this does not mean that I fully understood the Communist Party of China.
    In the early winter of 1932, I went to France and participated in four or five workers' evenings organized by the French Communist Party; in the spring of 1933, I went to England; in the summer to autumn of the same year, I went to the Soviet Union twice; in the winter of the same year, I returned to China to participate in the Fujian People's Government, and went to Japan after the failure. In the autumn of 1934, I returned to Shanghai to engage in film writing and directing. During this period, I clearly realized that there was no middle road to take.
    Chinese progressive literary and art workers generally received the leadership and influence of the Party directly or indirectly, and I was certainly no exception. After I returned to Shanghai in 1934, I was closer to the Party than before. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I became closer step by step, and even worked with underground Party members. Although I knew some terms of social science, I had not studied Marxism-Leninism well (of course, it was difficult to study before liberation, and I myself did not make up my mind to study it deeply), I did not understand the Party's policies, I did not specifically understand the superiority of the New Democracy system, and I did not know how to transition to a socialist society; even my own position was not on the side of the working class, but always on the side of the petty bourgeoisie, thinking that it was enough for petty-bourgeois intellectuals to sympathize with the proletariat and be willing to do their best for the victory of the revolution.
    More than six years have passed from the spring of 1949 to the present. During these six years, although I have not studied very well, I have participated in many important meetings; and I have held some positions in government agencies; I have gone through the literary and art rectification, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "three-anti" and "five-anti" campaigns, and the anti-bureaucracy movement; and I have also honorably studied the documents of Party consolidation with the Party member comrades. With the help of many comrades, especially directly under the leadership of the Party, I have truly made some progress. I understand that first of all, I must stand firm on the correct position, and then my thoughts and actions can be completely consistent, and that position and composition can be changed. I have further understood some of the Party's policies; I have recognized the noble qualities of Communist Party members from many aspects, and I have also seen the Party's education, training, and kind care for every Party member and non-Party cadre. I have seen how the party of the working class leads the people to achieve a series of great victories, transforming a country riddled with holes and fragmented by bandits and bandits into a strong country. I have realized the great ideal of the Party and the ways and steps to achieve this great ideal, and only then have I understood the historical significance of steadily moving towards a socialist society through the New Democracy system. In the past few years, in my work, I have gained some understanding of the principles of the united front and how to use criticism and self-criticism, I have more or less overcome the shortcomings of liberalism, and I am determined to be a Communist Party member who is loyal to the motherland and the people and strives for the cause of the Party.
    My first half of my life was muddled. After the age of forty-five, I made some progress. Only in the last six years have I felt that living is really meaningful. Although I am already in my sixties and suffering from intractable arthritis, I have the confidence to live happily. I deeply feel that the Communist Party of China is the greatest, most glorious, most correct, and most lovable party. Only by relying on the Party can there be true life, and only by relying on the Party can one have confidence, courage, and achievement in one's career, and make contributions to the motherland. My experience of more than forty years proves that personal struggle has great limitations. Joining the Party organization can make a tiny body exert infinite power.
    When I studied the eight requirements for Party members, I thought about my life from the beginning to the end, and felt that my biggest problem was that I had a strong sense of individuality and a weak fighting spirit. Although I have made progress in the past few years, I am still not fully qualified to be a Party member. But despite this, I still have a sincere wish, hoping that the Party can give me more training, so that I can get more encouragement and supervision in my organizational life, just like an old machine can generate a little more effect under the use of advanced workers. The old saying goes: "While there is still breath, this ambition must not be relaxed." I am confident that I still have some courage and unremitting ambition. Now that I have been honorably approved to join the Party, I must study Marxism-Leninism diligently under the help and supervision of comrades, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, work hard, and dedicate everything wholeheartedly to the cause of the Party—the realization of the great communist ideal—hoping to play the role of a small screw.

    我要为实现伟大的共产主义理想贡献一切
    欧阳予倩
    我是个极其平凡的戏剧工作者，尽管有追求真理的心，因为受旧文化的习染深而斗争性不强，所以对共产主义一向只是幻想式的向往，没有能够把整个生命投入火热的斗争中去，从斗争中逐步认识真理。
    我从事戏剧运动四十余年（从成年到现在自食其力没有干过任何其他谋利的事），在最初一个阶段（一九○七—一九一七年），我曾经挂起社会教育的招牌与封建势力相周旋；演了京戏之后倾向于艺术至上主义。我也做过种种改良旧戏的尝试，碰过不少钉子，但没找到正确的道路，也没有得到过一点同情的支援；我也曾搞过“爱美剧”运动，参加过上海戏剧协社、南国社，自己也办过剧团，成绩很小；写过不少剧本，比较成功的可以说没有。我的政治态度最初是反对外国人统治，进而反帝制，反军阀，反卖国贼，可只是心里想着，口里谈着，没有具体的、鲜明的行动。我对民国初年国民党一班新贵们的趾高气扬日趋腐化是有反感的；及至孙中山喊出打倒帝国主义的口号，我同情他所提倡的国民革命，也以为他所著的建国大纲是对的。“北伐”以后以为可能有些办法，我便放弃了舞台生活，想投身革命事业。由于蒋介石的极端反动，给了我很大的刺激，一时我不知道应当怎么样才好，就不免产生了感伤的情绪——我既不愿搭班子再演些无聊的戏，生活又没有办法，只好改行干电影，拍了两部默片，都不满意，觉得和老板们也不容易合作；以后我便到广东住了三年，办了个戏剧研究所。那时候，上海正组织左翼社会科学家联盟和左翼戏剧家联盟等团体。我自以为是不甘落后的。但那时我的思想相当混乱，从我当时所写的文章可以看得明白：我对进步的文艺理论并没有好好学习，只凭自己一点狭隘的知识和见解在那里乱碰。
    广东戏剧研究所解散，我回到上海，恰遇“一·二八”事变。此后我的思想有显著的转变：当“五·卅”惨案发生的时候，南通张季直写文章反对上海的工人运动和学生运动，我以为他很不应该，但不懂得他为什么会那样，证之以“一·二八”当时的所见所闻，令我联想起张季直的文章，又不禁想起长沙绅士为着对付共产党请日本兵舰向城里开炮的事，这我才相信阶级意识超过民族意识的说法完全正确。我们十九景的活报剧“不要忘了”（写“一·二八”淞沪之战和李顿调查团）就是那个时期写的。我开始认识工人阶级的品质，我又读了些中国共产党发表的文件，我便肯定地说：“只有中国共产党能救中国。”但这并不等于说我完全了解中国共产党。
    一九三二年初冬，我到了法国，参加过四、五次法国共产党所组织的工人晚会；一九三三年春到过英国；同年夏天到秋天到过苏联两次；同年冬回国参加了福建人民政府，失败后走日本。一九三四年秋回到上海从事电影编导。这一时期我明确地认识到没有中间路线可走。
    中国进步的文艺工作者一般地都直接间接地受到党的领导和影响，我当然也不能例外。一九三四年我回到上海后，比较以前和党接近了一些，抗日战争爆发后便一步步地更加接近，以至和地下党员共同活动。我虽然知道些社会科学的名词，并不曾好好学习过马克思列宁主义（解放前学习当然有困难，自己也没有下决心去钻研），不懂得党的政策，不具体明了新民主主义制度的优越性，不知道如何过渡到社会主义社会；就是自己的立场也不是站在工人阶级方面，而始终是站在小资产阶级方面，以为小资产阶级知识分子同情无产阶级、愿为革命的胜利尽其所能尽的一分力量也就行了。
    从一九四九年春天到如今已经六年多。在这六年当中，我虽然学习得很不好，但我参加过许多重大的会议；并且在政府机关担任过一些工作；经过文艺整风、镇压反革命、“三反”“五反”以及反官僚主义等运动；还光荣地和党员同志一同学习过整党的文件。在许多同志帮助之下，尤其是直接在党的领导之下，我才真正有了些进步，我明白了首先必须站稳正确的立场，然后思想和行动才能完全一致，而立场和成份是可以改变的。我进一步懂得了些党的政策；我从多方面认识了共产党员的高贵品质，也看到了党对每一个党员和非党干部的教育培养和亲切的关怀。我看到了工人阶级的党怎样领导人民取得一系列伟大的胜利，把一个被强盗土匪弄得千疮百孔、支离破碎的国家改变成为强盛的国家。体会到党的伟大理想和达到这一伟大理想的途径和步骤，这才懂得了通过新民主主义制度稳步走向社会主义社会的历史意义。几年来在工作当中，对统一战线的道理和如何运用批评和自我批评有了一些体会，多多少少克服了自由主义的缺点，决心要做一个忠于祖国和人民、为党的事业而奋斗的共产党员。
    我前半生算是糊里糊涂过了，四十五岁以后多少有些进步。只有最近的六年才觉得活得真有意义，尽管我已经六十多岁，还患着难治的关节炎症，我有信心愉快地活下去。我深深地感觉到中国共产党是最伟大、最光荣、最正确、最可爱的党。只有依靠党才有真正的生命，依靠党才能够对事业有信心、有勇气、有成就、对祖国有所贡献。从我四十余年的经验证明个人奋斗是有很大的局限的。参加党的组织便可使渺小之躯发挥无限的力量。
    当我学习党员八个条件的时候，我曾经把我的一生从头想过一下，觉得我最大的毛病就是个人意识浓厚，斗争性不强，这几年虽然有进步、做一个党员也还是不完全够资格。但尽管如此，还是有一个诚恳的愿望，希望党能给予更多的培养，使在组织生活中得到更多的鼓励和督促，好比一部旧机器在先进的工人运用之下可以多发生点滴的作用。古话说：“一息尚存，此志不容稍懈。”我自信也还有些勇气和不懈之志。现在我光荣地被批准入党，我一定要在同志们的帮助和督促之下，在党中央和毛泽东同志领导下努力学习马克思列宁主义，努力工作，全心全意为党的事业——实现伟大的共产主义理想——贡献一切，希望能起一个小螺丝钉的作用。
