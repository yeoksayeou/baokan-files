Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 21st - The tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly closed on December 20th.

    At the closing meeting, several heads of delegations made brief speeches.

    The British representative, Dixon, expressed regret that the United Nations had not admitted Japan. He also expressed great pleasure at seeing the new member states of the organization.

    The New Zealand representative, Munro, spoke on behalf of Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark, Iceland, and Norway, emphasizing that the General Assembly had resolved the issue of admitting new member states.

    The representative of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), R. Gunawardene, which recently joined the United Nations, spoke in his address, strongly advocating peaceful coexistence and mutual respect among nations.

    The American representative, Lodge, expressed regret that the United Nations had not admitted Japan. He expressed pleasure at the General Assembly's adoption of a resolution on disarmament and the compromise solution to the Security Council election issue.

    The Egyptian representative, Lutfi, spoke on behalf of the delegations of the Arab countries and the Greek delegation, believing that the admission of sixteen new member states into the United Nations was a "most important decision" for the United Nations.

    The head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetsov, pointed out that resolving the issue of the United Nations admitting new member states undoubtedly made a valuable contribution to international cooperation and strengthening the United Nations. At the same time, he pointed out that the General Assembly had not taken any new steps in resolving the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. He said that the resolution on this issue adopted by the General Assembly did not include measures to implement disarmament. The Soviet representative said that the Soviet Union will continue to strive to achieve the lofty goals set forth in the Soviet disarmament plan.

    Kuznetsov pointed out that the extremely important issue of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations has not yet been resolved. This situation, which damages the prestige of the United Nations, is intolerable.

    The Yugoslav representative, Matis, said that the admission of new member states to the United Nations was an auspicious sign for the United Nations as it entered the second decade of its founding. Speaking of the Security Council's election of Yugoslavia, Matis said: "We have always firmly believed that elections should be conducted in accordance with normal procedures and according to the principle of regional distribution."

    After the representatives of Hungary, Spain, Cambodia, and Italy spoke, the representative of the Polish People's Republic, Naszkowski, spoke. He expressed regret that the United Nations had not yet admitted the Mongolian People's Republic and Japan, and he hoped that the United Nations would soon admit these two countries.

    Next to speak were the representatives of Laos, Czechoslovakia, India, and the President of the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly, Masa.

    The tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly then closed.
