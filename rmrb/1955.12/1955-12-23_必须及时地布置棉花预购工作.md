    Cotton Pre-purchase Work Must Be Arranged Promptly
    The agricultural cooperative movement is currently flourishing, and the comprehensive planning of agricultural production is actively underway. Agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers are all formulating their 1956 agricultural production plans based on the requirements of the comprehensive plan. In order to encourage cooperatives, teams, and individual farmers to make their cotton production plans for next year more ambitious, cotton pre-purchase work must be carried out promptly.
    The State Council issued an instruction on December 22 regarding the 1956 cotton pre-purchase work. This instruction summarizes the experience of the 1955 cotton pre-purchase work and stipulates the tasks and methods of the 1956 cotton pre-purchase work. Cotton pre-purchase work plays a significant role in promoting the development of agricultural cooperation, strengthening the comprehensive planning of agricultural production, and helping agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers overcome production difficulties and expand production investment. Party organizations and people's committees in cotton-producing areas at all levels must, in accordance with the State Council's instructions, promptly deploy the pre-purchase work, so that agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers can combine it with the state's pre-purchase plan when formulating their own production plans and bring their production plans into the orbit of the state plan.
    The State Council's instruction on cotton pre-purchase pointed out that the 1955 pre-purchase work was arranged relatively late and failed to be combined with the work of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in formulating production plans, with the result that after the pre-purchase tasks were assigned to the townships, the cooperatives and mutual aid teams had to hastily revise their plans and readjust their investment and labor allocation plans. This lesson fully demonstrates that the pre-purchase tasks must be assigned to the cooperatives and mutual aid teams before they formulate their production plans, so that they can formulate cotton planting plans, investment plans, and labor allocation plans based on the pre-purchase tasks.
    The achievements of the 1955 cotton pre-purchase work show that the cotton pre-purchase method is warmly welcomed by the farmers. This method involves the state informing cotton farmers of the amount of cotton it intends to purchase from them before planting, and the purchasing departments fixing the purchasing relationship with the farmers in the form of contracts. In this way, the farmers have a clear idea of ​​production; and because they receive a large amount of deposit from the state and preferential treatment in the supply of materials, some of the difficulties in the production and life of cotton farmers are also solved; the enthusiasm of cotton farmers for production is greatly encouraged, which is one of the important reasons for this year's bumper cotton harvest. After this year's autumn harvest, the farmers who signed contracts with the state, led by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, actively fulfilled their pre-sale contracts and enthusiastically sold cotton to the state. From September to the end of November, the national cotton purchase figure has reached 84.8 percent of the annual plan, which is 214 percent of the purchase volume in the same period last year. The recovery of prepaid deposits is also very smooth. In some areas, all prepaid deposits were recovered in a short period of time after the new cotton was put on the market; by mid-November, 84.2 percent of the prepaid deposits had been recovered nationwide. These circumstances fully demonstrate the significant role of pre-purchase contracts in encouraging farmers to actively increase production and enthusiastically sell cotton.
    Cotton pre-purchase is an important measure for implementing the policy of unified cotton purchase and completing the task of unified purchase. However, if only cotton pre-purchase is carried out without the state's policy of unified cotton purchase, the state will not be able to control all commercial cotton. Pre-purchase is carried out before spring plowing and sowing. Because cotton is affected by subjective and objective factors such as climate, rainfall, cultivation techniques, and field management during the growth period, the actual cotton yield often differs from the yield stipulated in the contract. In order to balance the purchase plans in areas with increased and decreased production, and in order to overcome the hoarding and reluctance to sell that may be generated by some wealthy farmers after completing the contract tasks, it is necessary to implement the policy of unified purchase; pre-purchase contracts cannot solve these problems. Therefore, the State Council pointed out in the instruction on cotton pre-purchase that it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of unified cotton purchase and promote cotton production through pre-purchase to ensure the completion of the state's purchase tasks.
    The State Council stipulates that in 1956, 10 percent of the total value of pre-purchased cotton will be paid to cotton farmers as a deposit; for every dan (approximately 50kg) of ginned cotton pre-sold by cotton farmers, they will be supplied with an additional 10 jin (approximately 5kg) of grain and 10 chi (approximately 3.3 meters) of cotton cloth outside the unified sales quota of grain and cotton cloth, and they will also be supplied with 50 to 100 jin of oil cake fertilizer. It is estimated that through pre-purchase contracts, deposits amounting to more than 200 million yuan will be paid to farmers in cotton-producing areas across the country, and preferentially supplied grain will amount to more than 200 million jin, more than 2 million bolts of cotton cloth, and more than 2 billion jin of fertilizer. This is a huge material force for realizing the production plans of cotton-producing provinces, counties, districts, and townships, and provides favorable conditions for increasing cotton production next year. In order to promote the development of agricultural cooperation, the instruction stipulates that appropriately more deposits should be paid to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, but the difference between the deposits received by cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers should not be too large. For newly organized cooperatives with a relatively weak production base, the amount of fertilizer supplied can also be appropriately increased. In order to encourage cotton farmers to increase production and sell more cotton, the State Council instructed that if farmers overfulfill the cotton sales tasks stipulated in the contract, in addition to the fact that the supply of deposits and fertilizer will not be increased, the preferential treatment for the supply of grain and cotton cloth should be increased proportionally.
    Cotton pre-purchase is a powerful measure to guide farmers to increase production in accordance with state plans. This is not only reflected in the advance payment of deposits and preferential supply of materials, but also in the review of pre-purchase contracts. After purchasing departments sign pre-purchase contracts with farmers, they must not think that everything is going well and that the purchasing task has been completed; they should pay sufficient attention to the cotton's growth process together with the agricultural departments. The State Council instructed that after the cotton seedlings emerge, all localities should, based on local conditions, cooperate with agricultural product purchasing departments and agricultural departments to verify the cotton field planting area. If there is a lack of seedlings, farmers should be mobilized to transplant seedlings and strengthen field management to prevent pests and diseases, and to ensure a bumper cotton harvest.
    Putting all the commercial cotton that the state plans to purchase into pre-purchase contracts is a considerable and arduous task. Party committees and people's committees in all cotton-producing areas must not only allocate the area, output, and purchase volume of pre-purchased cotton level by level without delay, but also combine with the current central work to widely publicize the policy of unified cotton purchase and the pre-purchase method to farmers, and educate farmers to produce and sell cotton in accordance with contracts. The Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement should formulate cotton pre-purchase methods in accordance with the State Council's pre-purchase instructions, strengthen the organization of cotton pre-purchase work, and simplify the procedures for cotton pre-purchase as much as possible, so that cotton pre-purchase work can be carried out in an orderly manner, creating favorable conditions for the unified cotton purchase work after the autumn harvest next year.

### 必须及时地布置棉花预购工作

    必须及时地布置棉花预购工作
    目前农业合作化运动正在蓬勃发展，农业生产的全面规划工作正在积极进行；农业生产合作社、互助组和个体农民都在根据全面规划的要求，制定一九五六年的农业生产计划。为了推动社、组和个体农民把明年的棉花生产计划定得更积极些，必须及时地进行棉花预购工作。
    国务院在十二月二十二日发布了一九五六年预购棉花工作指示。这个指示总结了一九五五年棉花预购工作的经验，规定了一九五六年棉花预购工作的任务和作法。棉花预购工作对于促进农业合作化的发展，加强农业生产的全面规划，帮助农业生产合作社、互助组和个体农民克服生产困难，扩大生产投资，都有重大的作用。各地棉产区的党组织和人民委员会，必须根据国务院的指示，及时地把预购棉花工作布置下去，使农业生产合作社、互助组和个体农民在制定自己的生产计划的时候，同国家的预购计划结合起来，把他们的生产计划纳入国家计划轨道。
    国务院预购棉花指示指出：一九五五年度的预购工作布置较晚，没有能够和农业生产合作社、互助组订立生产计划的工作结合起来，以致在预购任务布置到乡以后，合作社、互助组不得不仓促修改计划，重新调整农业投资和劳动力的分配计划。这个教训充分说明了必须在合作社、互助组制定生产计划以前，就把预购任务布置给它们，使它们能够根据预购任务，制定棉花播种计划、投资和劳动力的分配计划。
    一九五五年预购棉花工作的成绩说明，棉花预购办法受到农民的热烈欢迎。这个办法是在种植棉花以前，国家就对棉农说明国家将要向他们购买多少棉花，并且由采购部门同农民把购买关系用合同形式固定下来。这样，农民对于生产就有底了；由于得到国家付给的大批定金和实物供应上的优待，棉农在生产和生活上的若干困难也解决了；棉农的生产积极性得到极大的鼓舞，这是今年棉花丰收的重要原因之一。今年秋收以后，同国家订了合同的农民，在农业生产合作社和互助组带动下，积极履行预售合同，向国家踊跃出售棉花。从九月到十一月底，国家购棉数字已达到年度计划的百分之八十四点八，为去年同期收购量的百分之二百一十四。预付定金的收回也很顺利，有些地区在新棉上市的短时间内，就把预付定金全部收回了；到十一月中旬，全国已收回预付定金百分之八十四点二。这些情况充分说明了预购合同在鼓励农民积极增产、踊跃售棉方面的重大作用。
    棉花预购是贯彻执行棉花统购政策和完成统购任务的重要措施。但是，如果仅仅进行棉花预购，而没有国家对棉花的统购政策，国家还不可能掌握全部商品棉。预购是在春耕播种以前进行的，由于棉花在成长期间要受气候、雨水、耕作技术和田间管理等主客观原因的影响，棉花的实产量和合同规定的产量往往会有出入。为了使增产、减产地区的收购计划得到抵补平衡，为了克服部分富裕农民在完成合同任务以后可能产生的囤积惜售现象，就必须贯彻执行统购政策；预购合同就不能解决这些问题。因此，国务院在预购棉花指示中指出，要继续贯彻执行棉花统购政策，通过预购来促进棉花增产，保证国家收购任务的完成。
    国务院规定一九五六年按预购棉花总值百分之十付给棉农定金；棉农每预售一担皮棉，在粮食、棉布统销定额以外，多供应十斤粮食、十尺棉布，并且供应五十斤到一百斤饼肥。估计通过预购合同，付给全国棉区农民的定金将达两亿多元，优待供应的粮食有二亿多斤，棉布二百多万匹，肥料二十多亿斤。这是实现棉区省、县、区、乡生产规划的巨大物质力量，给明年棉花增产提供了有利的条件。为了促进农业合作化的发展，指示中规定：要对农业生产合作社、互助组适当多付定金，但是，合作社、互助组和个体农民得到定金的差额幅度不应该过大。对于新组织起来的、生产基础比较薄弱的合作社，也可以酌情提高供应肥料的数量。为了鼓励棉农增加生产，多售棉花，国务院指示中规定，农民如果超额完成合同规定的售棉任务，除了定金和肥料的供应优待不另增加以外，粮食、棉布的供应优待应该按比例增加。
    棉花预购是指导农民按照国家计划进行增产的有力措施。这不仅表现在预付定金和优待供应实物方面，而且表现在预购合同的复查方面。采购部门同农民订立了预购合同以后，决不能认为已经万事大吉，已经完成采购任务了；它应该同农业部门一起，对棉花的生长过程，给以足够的注意。国务院指示，在棉苗出土以后，各地应该根据当地的情况，由农产品采购部门和农业部门相配合，核实棉田播种面积，如有缺苗现象，应该动员农民进行移苗补苗，并且督促农民加强田间管理，防治病虫害，保证棉花丰收。
    把国家计划收购的全部商品棉订入预购合同，是一件相当繁重的工作。各产棉区党委、人民委员会不仅要不误农时地把预购棉花的面积、产量、收购量逐级分配下去，而且要结合当前中心工作，向农民广泛地宣传棉花统购政策和预购办法，教育农民按照合同进行生产、出售棉花。农产品采购部应该根据国务院预购指示，制定棉花预购办法，加强预购棉花的组织工作，尽量简化预购棉花的手续，使棉花预购工作有条不紊，给明年秋后的棉花统购工作创造有利的条件。
