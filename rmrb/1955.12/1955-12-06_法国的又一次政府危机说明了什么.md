What Does France's Latest Government Crisis Indicate?
　　Tan Wenrui
　　On November 29th, the French National Assembly, with 318 votes against 218, refused to give the Faure government a vote of confidence, forming a new government crisis, less than 300 days after Faure took office as Prime Minister. After Faure's vote of confidence failed in the parliament, he requested the President to order the dissolution of the National Assembly in accordance with the constitution, and determined to hold the general election on January 2nd next year. After Faure announced the dissolution of the parliament, the National Executive Committee of the Radical Socialist Party decided to expel him from the party, and five Radical Socialist ministers announced that they would no longer have any relationship with the Faure government.
　　This new crisis in France's unstable political situation was caused by the election issue. The Faure government and its majority faction, seeing the growing dissatisfaction and opposition of the masses of the people to their current policies, feared that this would weaken their position in the general election next year; at the same time, they were eager to form a new right-wing alliance, attempting to manipulate a more stable majority in the parliament to support the government in continuing to promote its reactionary policies. Therefore, more than a month ago, they proposed to advance the National Assembly election, originally scheduled for June next year, to December this year. However, the French bourgeois parties have very different opinions on this issue of early elections. Some parties, such as the right wing of the Radical Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Independent Republicans, Independent Peasants, Peasants' Party, Republican and Social Action Alliance, and Overseas Independent Party, which belong to the so-called "moderates," are in favor of early elections. Other parties, such as the Social Republican Party, the so-called left wing of the Radical Socialist Party led by Mendès-France, and the Socialist Party, oppose early elections.
　　At the same time, the bourgeois parties, starting from their own interests, also have differences regarding what kind of electoral system to adopt in the future elections. Some advocate modifying the current party alliance system, which has been widely condemned domestically, while others hope to retain this system. Due to the increasing strengthening of the alliance between the grassroots organizations of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, the bourgeois parties, who are at odds with each other, want to formulate an electoral system that can both exclude progressive forces and maximize their own benefits, and therefore launched a struggle on the election issue.
　　The French Communist Party has expressed a clear and firm attitude towards the election issue from the beginning. The French Communist Party declared that the Communists are always ready to listen to the voters' judgment, and that early elections can reduce the current ruling reactionary majority from doing anti-people deeds for six months, so they support early elections, and at the same time advocate abolishing the current anti-democratic party alliance electoral system and adopting a proportional representation system.
　　The votes in favor of the French Communist Party enabled the Faure government's proposal for early elections to obtain a majority in the National Assembly. However, due to the scheming activities of anti-democratic forces, the two houses of parliament debated back and forth on the issue of the electoral system. On November 25th, the Faure government requested the National Assembly to put aside the discussion on the government's general policy and give priority to deliberating the government bill it proposed on early general elections and the electoral system, and asked the National Assembly to hold a vote of confidence on this procedural issue. Obviously, the purpose of the Faure government's move was to avoid debates and condemnations of its policies before the election. In his speech, Congressman Vallon criticized the government for implementing a policy of subservience to the United States, concealing the situation of American forces squeezing out France in Morocco and Vietnam. Duclos, the leader of the French Communist Party parliamentary group, condemned the government's North African colonial policy in his speech before the vote. He pointed out that this time "the question of confidence is not so much about early elections as it is about the government's general policy." The French Communist Party cannot agree with the Faure government's general policy, so the French Communist Party members cannot express confidence in the government. Thus, the trust proposal put forward by Faure was defeated.
　　Although this new government crisis in France was caused by the election issue, it is another reflection of the bankruptcy of the anti-people policies pursued by the French ruling group for several years. Since the 1951 general election, the successive cabinets of the so-called government majority faction formed by right-wing parties have continued to pursue domestic policies that impoverish the working people and diplomatic policies that betray national interests, which has deepened the gap between it and the broad masses of the people. Under the condition of the continuous growth of the people's opposition forces, the divisions and contradictions within the French ruling group cannot but become more and more acute. As a result, France's cabinet has changed frequently and the government crisis has become increasingly serious in recent years. Nine months ago, Faure was able to come to power only by relying on a vague political program, wooing various right-wing parties to put together a reluctant majority in the parliament. However, there are many differences among the parties in the government majority faction on domestic and foreign policies, so the foundation of the Faure government was extremely unstable. After coming to power, the Faure government, facing the strong desire of the French people to change its policies, continued to follow the anti-people and anti-national path. It was it that promoted the completion of the ratification of the Paris Agreement by the Council of the Republic of France, allowing West Germany to rearm, making France an ally of German militarists, thereby tearing up the alliance with the Soviet Union. It was it that decided to adopt increasingly intensified bloody suppression policies in North Africa, affecting 200,000 French families. It was it that followed the United States' policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, making France unable to escape the heavy burden of armaments. It was the economic measures it took that further deteriorated the lives of the French working people, with more and more people suffering from unemployment, while the profits of large enterprises continued to grow. The reactionary policies pursued by the Faure government cannot but be met with increasingly strong resistance from the broad masses of the people. Therefore, the inherently fragile and unstable position of the Faure government cannot but be further weakened, and it finally could not avoid the crisis.
　　This new government crisis in France once again proves that the French government will eventually not escape the fate of failure if it does not change its policies that have been consistently pursued for many years in violation of the interests of the people.
　　The Faure government, which has already failed in the parliamentary vote of confidence, is now taking advantage of the fact that the vote of no confidence accounts for more than half of the seats in the National Assembly to dissolve the National Assembly in order to realize its plot of early elections. At the same time, it has prevented any modification of the electoral system, so that the election will still be held according to the anti-democratic electoral system used in the last general election, attempting to maintain their position in the next parliament in this way. However, it must be pointed out that the characteristics of the current French political situation are: on the one hand, the French people's political consciousness has been raised to an unprecedented level, and they strongly demand a change in the government's current policies; at the same time, the united front of organizing various progressive forces led by the French Communist Party is constantly developing and strengthening. On the other hand, the contradictions and divisions within and between the bourgeois parties are deepening, and the so-called government majority faction is tending to fall apart. Therefore, it is much more difficult for right-wing parties to continue to hold a large majority of seats in the next parliament. The French democratic forces will do everything possible to oppose all election scams and demand the implementation of an electoral system that can give all parties fair and reasonable representation. The French Communist Party has issued a statement suggesting that the Socialist Party and all Republicans who hope for a policy that reflects the will of the people form an alliance with the Communist Party in the election, with the propositions of disarmament, international reconciliation, negotiated settlement of the North African issue, general increase in wages, and the adoption of measures to protect small farmers as the basis of this alliance. The united action of the French working people will be able to change the current policies that do not conform to the national interests of France and the wishes of the French people.

    法国的又一次政府危机说明了什么
    谭文瑞
    法国国民议会十一月二十九日以三一八票对二一八票拒绝给予富尔政府以信任，形成了新的政府危机，这离开富尔受任总理还不到三百天。富尔在议会中举行的信任投票遭到失败后，已根据宪法要求总统下令解散了国民议会，并确定在明年一月二日举行大选。在富尔宣布解散议会后，激进社会党全国执行委员会就决定把他开除出党，同时五名激进社会党的部长宣布同富尔政府不再发生关系。
    法国的不稳定的政局中这次新的危机，是由选举问题引起的。富尔政府和它的多数派看到他们的现行政策遭受人民群众日益增长的不满和反对，害怕这样下去会削弱他们在明年大选中的地位；同时他们急欲结成一个新的右翼联盟，企图在议会中操纵一个比较稳定的多数，以便支持政府继续推行它的各项反动政策，因此在一个多月以前提出要把原应在明年六月举行的国民议会选举提前到今年十二月举行。但是在这个提前选举的问题上，法国各资产阶级政党的意见很不一致。有些政党，像激进社会党的右翼，人民共和党以及属于所谓“温和派”的独立共和党、独立农民党、农民党、共和与社会行动联盟和海外独立党等，赞成提前选举。另外一些党派，如社会共和党、以孟戴斯—弗朗斯为首的所谓激进社会党左翼，以及社会党等，则反对提前。
    同时，各资产阶级政党从自己的利益出发，对于在未来的选举中采取什么样的选举制度，也存在着分歧。一部分主张修改现行的已在国内遭到广泛谴责的党派联盟制度，一部分则希望保留这种制度。由于共产党和社会党基层组织的联盟日益加强，同床异梦的各资产阶级党派想要制定一种既能排斥进步力量而又能使自己得到最大好处的选举制度，因此在选举问题上展开了斗争。
    法国共产党从开始就对选举问题表示了明朗而坚定的态度。法共声明：共产党人在任何时候都是准备听从选民裁决的，而提前选举可以使现在执政的反动的多数派少干六个月反人民的勾当，因此赞成提前选举，同时主张废除现行反民主的党派联盟选举制而采取比例代表制。
    法国共产党的赞成票使富尔政府提出的提前选举的建议在国民议会中获得多数而通过。但是由于反民主势力勾心斗角的活动，在选举制度的问题上议会两院之间往返争持不下。十一月二十五日，富尔政府要求国民议会搁置关于政府总政策的讨论，而优先审议它所提出的关于提前大选和选举制度的政府法案，并要国民议会就这个程序问题举行信任投票。很显然，富尔政府这一举动的目的是想在选举之前逃避开对它的政策的辩论和谴责。议员伐隆就在发言中批评政府执行屈从美国的政策，掩盖美国势力在摩洛哥和越南排挤法国的情况。法共议会党团领袖杜克洛在投票前发言谴责政府的北非殖民政策。他指出，这一次“信任的问题与其说是在于提前选举，还不如说是在于政府的总政策”。法国共产党是不能同意富尔政府的总政策的，所以法共议员不能对政府表示信任。这样富尔提出的信任案就遭到了失败。
    法国这次新的政府危机虽然是由选举问题而引起的，但是它是法国统治集团几年来推行的反人民政策破产的又一次反映。一九五一年大选以来，右翼政党所结成的所谓政府多数派的历届内阁，继续奉行使劳动人民日益贫穷化的国内政策和出卖民族利益的外交政策，这使得它同广大人民之间的鸿沟日益加深。在人民反对力量不断增长的情况下，法国统治集团内部的分歧和矛盾也就不能不愈来愈加剧。结果是几年来法国的内阁更迭频繁，政府危机日益深重。九个月前，富尔是靠了一个暧昧不明的政纲，拉拢右翼各党派拼凑成议会中的一个勉强的多数才能上台的。但是在政府多数派的各政党之间，在内政和外交问题上存在着许多分歧，因此富尔政府的基础本来就是极不稳固的。富尔政府上台后，面对着法国人民要求改变政策的强烈愿望，却继续走着反人民、反民族的道路。是它促使法国共和国参议会完成了对巴黎协定的批准，让西德重新武装，使法国成为德国军国主义者的同盟者，从而撕毁了同苏联之间的盟约。是它决定在北非采取变本加厉的血腥镇压政策，使法国二十万个家庭受到影响。是它追随美国扩军备战的政策，使得法国也摆脱不掉沉重的军备重担。是它采取的经济措施，使法国劳动人民的生活进一步恶化，愈来愈多的人遭受失业的痛苦，而大企业的利润却继续增长。富尔政府所推行的这种反动政策，不能不遭到广大人民日益强烈的反抗。因此，富尔政府本来就脆弱不稳的地位不能不进一步削弱，终于无法避免危机。
    法国这次新的政府危机再一次证明了：法国政府如果不改变多年来一贯奉行的违反人民利益的政策，是终究逃不脱失败的命运的。
    在议会信任投票中已经失败的富尔政府现在利用不信任票占国民议会议席半数以上的情况，解散了国民议会，以实现它提前选举的图谋，同时阻止了对选举制度的任何修改，使选举将仍旧根据上次大选所使用的反民主选举制度举行，企图这样来保持它们在下一届议会中的地位。但是必须指出，目前法国政治形势的特点是：一方面法国人民的政治觉悟空前提高，他们强烈要求改变政府的现行政策；同时法国共产党所领导的组织各进步力量的统一战线正不断开展和加强。另一方面，各资产阶级政党内部和相互之间的矛盾和分歧日益加深，所谓政府多数派趋于四分五裂。因此，在下一届议会中右翼党派要继续把持绝大多数议席是困难得多了。法国民主力量将全力反对一切选举骗局，要求实行一种能够使各党派都有公正合理代表的选举制度。法国共产党已发表声明，建议社会党和一切希望有一项反映人民意愿的政策的共和人士同共产党在选举中结成联盟，以裁军、国际和解、谈判解决北非问题，普遍增加工资，采取保护小农的措施等主张为这一联盟的基础。法国劳动人民的团结一致行动，将能够改变不符合法国民族利益和法国人民愿望的现行政策。
