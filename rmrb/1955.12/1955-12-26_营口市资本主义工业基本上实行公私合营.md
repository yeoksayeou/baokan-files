The capitalist industry in Yingkou City has basically implemented joint public-private ownership. The number of joint ventures accounts for 77.45% of the total number of private industrial households in the city, the number of employees accounts for 90% of the total number of employees in private industry, and the output value accounts for 95.7% of the total output value of private industry. Capitalist industry in the city has basically implemented joint public-private ownership.

Yingkou's private industries were small in scale, scattered, technologically backward, lacked equipment, and were unevenly distributed. Based on this situation, the government adopted two methods when planning the joint public-private ownership of the entire industry: one was to absorb small private factories into existing joint public-private enterprises according to production dependencies and the capitalists' willingness; the other was to implement factory mergers with large factories leading small factories and advanced factories leading backward factories. After the factory mergers, the enterprises achieved a balance in production and technology. For example, the originally joint public-private Jufa and Fuyuan Machinery Factories absorbed some small factories and became all-around factories, with various processes such as turning, planing, riveting, forging, welding, and sand casting connected, thereby improving production efficiency, saving expenses, and being able to accept more complex tasks, basically solving the current problem of insufficient tasks.

    营口市资本主义工业基本上实行公私合营
    营口市全市的资本主义工业已经基本上实行了公私合营。合营数占全市私营工业总户数的百分之七十七点四五，职工人数占私营工业职工总数的百分之九十，产值占私营工业总产值的百分之九十五点七，全市资本主义工业已经基本上实行了公私合营。
    营口市私营工业规模小、分散、技术落后、设备不足、分布不均衡，政府根据这种情况，在规划全行业公私合营时，采取了两种办法：一种是将私营小厂根据生产依存关系和资本家的自愿，分别吸收到已经公私合营的企业中去；另一种是以大厂带小厂、以先进带落后实行并厂。经过并厂，各企业在生产和技术上都得到了平衡。如原公私合营的聚发、富源两机械厂吸收些小厂后，都变成了全能工厂，车、钳、铆、锻、焊和翻砂等各项工序都衔接了起来，从而提高了生产效率，节约了开支，并能接受较复杂的任务，基本上解决了目前任务不足的问题。
