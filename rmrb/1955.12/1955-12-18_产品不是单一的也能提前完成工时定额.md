    Can Fulfill Work Quotas Ahead of Schedule Even if Products Are Not Uniform

    To the Editor:

    I am a young lathe operator at the Shenyang Transformer Factory. On July 6th of this year, I already completed my work quota for the entire year of 1955; now, if calculated according to the current work quota, I am already doing the work for October 1956!

    This year, when Shenyang City held the conference of young socialist construction activists, I set a plan to complete the work quota for October 1956 by the end of this year. But later, I was transferred to a new workshop. I was a bit rusty when I first operated the new machine tool; and the products were either small batches or single pieces, doing a dozen different jobs a day. Just clamping the workpiece and preparing the tools took up half a day. This made it difficult to complete the work quota according to plan. What to do when the promise I made myself was about to fail? So, I focused on reducing auxiliary work hours, and also selected some jobs with larger machining volumes to use the "Kolesov" and "Unanov" tool methods. As a result, work efficiency greatly improved. For example, the base of the transformer porcelain bushing was supposed to take 30 minutes to make; using the "Kolesov" tool method, it only took me 15 minutes to make each one. This dispelled my previous idea that small quantity jobs could not use advanced Soviet experience.

    After this, most of my jobs already reached the quota, and some even exceeded the quota; but it was still difficult to complete the plan I had proposed. Based on the characteristics of frequent job changes and the need for many tools, I prepared all the tools needed according to the job plan before going to work every day and placed them in an orderly manner in front of the machine tool, which greatly reduced the time spent looking for tools. When encountering a large number of jobs, I tried to work on them together. For example, for the "end ring" part, the revised work quota in November was eight minutes per piece. I clamped five pieces at a time, and using the "Kolesov" tool method, it only took 18 minutes to machine them all, increasing work efficiency by more than one time.

    As a result, my enthusiasm for work has also increased. In November alone, I overfulfilled the monthly workload by 115 percent, and the quality of the products was excellent. I will definitely continue to work harder and ensure that I make greater contributions to the realization of the first Five-Year Plan in future production.

### 产品不是单一的也能提前完成工时定额

    产品不是单一的也能提前完成工时定额编辑同志：
    我是沈阳变压器厂的青年车工。今年七月六日，我已经完成了一九五五年全年的工时定额；现在，如果按目前的工作定额计算，我已经在做一九五六年十月份的工作了！
    今年，当沈阳市召开青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的时候，我就订出计划，要在今年年底完成一九五六年十月份的工时定额。但是后来我被调到一个新的工段工作。刚操纵新机床，有点手生；产品又是小批的或单件的，一天做十几样活，光卡活和准备工具就要占半天时间。这样，就很难按计划完成工时定额。自己提出的诺言，眼看不能兑现了，怎么办呢？于是，我就从减少辅助工时方面打主意，又选择一些加工量比较大的活运用“科列索夫”和“乌纳诺夫”车刀法，结果工作效率大大提高了。像变压器瓷套底座，按规定是三十分钟做一个；我运用了“科列索夫”车刀法加工，每做一个只要十五分钟就行了。这就使我打消了以前认为数量少的活不能用苏联先进经验的想法。
    在这以后，我多数的活已经达到定额，有的还超过定额；但是要完成我所提出的计划，仍然有困难。我又根据换活多、需要工具多的特点，每天上班前就按作业计划把要用的工具都准备好，有秩序地放在床子跟前，这就大大地减少了找工具的时间。遇到数量多的活，我就想办法套着干。例如“端环”这种零件，十一月份修改的工时定额是每八分钟一个，我一次卡五个活，利用“科列索夫”车刀法，只要十八分钟就全部车好了，提高了工作效率一倍多。
    这一来，我的工作劲头也就更大了，光十一月份就超额百分之一百一十五完成了全月工作量，产品的质量都是优等。我一定继续加倍努力，保证在今后的生产中为实现第一个五年计划做出更大的贡献。
