Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 27th: According to TASS, the Moscow House of Scientific Workers held a press conference on December 24th, presided over by Academician Shebakov, Chairman of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Antarctic Research Committee. About 100 journalists from Soviet and other countries' newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations were briefed on the situation regarding North and South Pole exploration.

Shebakov said that Soviet scientists had adopted some novel methods in their exploration work in the Antarctic and Arctic regions. For example, this exploration work has been combined with the regular movement of ice floes. However, in the past, ships were frozen together with large ice floes and drifted along. Now, thanks to the advancement of aviation technology, it is possible to select the most suitable large ice floes and establish floating ice stations on them. These scientific stations have now become true floating observatories. For example, "North Pole-4" is such a scientific station. Shebakov said that, contrary to assumptions, the ice floes do not move in a circular motion, but in a due westerly direction.

The purpose of the work at the Arctic floating ice stations is primarily to study the possibility of navigation on the Northern Sea Route along the Siberian coast, and to ensure the supply of accurate scientific information during navigation. The scope of the exploration work carried out at the scientific stations is extremely broad. Its research objects include the seabed, the ice surface, the atmosphere, and even the ionosphere. Currently, scientists are determining the contours of the Lomonosov underwater mountain range that extends from the New Siberian Islands to Ellesmere Island. Geophysicists recently concluded that there are two more underwater mountain ranges parallel to the Lomonosov Ridge. The direction of these ancient mountain ranges is currently being determined.

Shebakov pointed out that the observation of the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean is one of the important achievements. It was originally speculated that there was an anticyclone over this ocean. However, it has now been discovered that cyclones occur here, and the temperature is higher than previously imagined.

Shebakov pointed out that Soviet scholars have always been very interested in Antarctica. The purpose of the Academy of Sciences' expedition's recent departure to Antarctica is to establish strongholds in advance for exploration during the International Geophysical Year. Soviet scientists will establish several scientific stations in Antarctica, named "Mirny," "Sovetskaya," and "Vostok." Shebakov pointed out that "Vostok" and "Mirny" were the names of the ships on which the Russian explorers Bellingshausen and Lazarev sailed when they passed by the Antarctic continent a long time ago.

Shebakov answered many questions raised by the journalists.

A journalist from "News" magazine said that Western newspapers are now talking a lot about Antarctica, and some say that the Soviet Union intends to strategically utilize Antarctica. Shebakov replied to this point that it is very strange to harbor strategic purposes in such a remote place in the south. The Soviet expedition is going to complete the research work of a certain link stipulated in the International Geophysical Year program.

    苏联的南北极考察工作
    新华社二十七日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科科学工作者之家在十二月二十四日举行了由苏联科学院南极考察委员会主席谢巴科夫院士主持的记者招待会，向到会的苏联和其他国家的报纸、通讯社和电台的约一百名记者介绍了关于南北极考察的情况。
    谢巴科夫说苏联科学家在南、北极地区进行的考察工作中采用了一些新颖的方法。例如，这种考察工作已经同冰块的有规律的移动结合在一起。不过，从前是船只冻在大冰块一起漂浮。而现在，由于航空技术的进步，可以选择最合适的大冰块，在上面建立浮冰科学站，这种科学站现在已成为真正的漂浮观象台。例如，“北极—四号”就是这样的科学站。谢巴科夫说，同假定相反，浮冰不是作圆形的移动，它的移动方向是正西。
    北极浮冰科学站工作的目的首先是，研究在西伯利亚沿岸北方航海线上航行的可能性，并且保证航行的时候供给准确的科学情报。科学站上所进行的考察工作范围极广。它的研究对象包括：海底、冰面、大气层，甚至电离层。目前，科学家们正在确定从新西伯利亚群岛延伸到埃列斯米尔地的洛蒙诺索夫海底山脉的轮廓。地球物理学家们最近得出结论：同洛蒙诺索夫山脉平行的，还有两条海底山脉。目前正在确定这些古老山脉的走向。
    谢巴科夫指出，对北冰洋上的大气层进行的观察是重要的成就之一。原来推想，在这个大洋上空有一种反旋风。而现在发现，这里发生的是旋风，温度比以前想像的要高。
    谢巴科夫指出，苏联学者一贯对南极很感兴趣。科学院考察团之所以在最近出发到南极去，是为了预先建立起供在地球物理年进行考察用的据点。苏联科学家将要在南极建立起名为“和平”、“苏维埃”和“东方”的几个科学站。谢巴科夫指出，“东方”和“和平”是很久以前俄国探险家别林斯高晋和拉扎雷夫经过南极大陆的时候所乘的船只的名字。
    谢巴科夫答复了记者们提出的许多问题。
  “新闻”杂志记者说，西方报纸现在大量谈到南极，有人说苏联打算在战略上利用南极。谢巴科夫就这一点回答说，在南部这么遥远的地方抱有战略目的是十分奇怪的事情。苏联考察团是要去完成地球物理年计划规定的一定环节的研究工作。
