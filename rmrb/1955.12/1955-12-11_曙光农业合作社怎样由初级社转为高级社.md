How the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative Transformed from a Primary to an Advanced Cooperative
    Chen Junsheng, Wang Lianjia
    The Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, was established in 1952 on the basis of a year-round mutual aid team. At that time, the cooperative had a total of 17 households, 34 laborers, 162.79 hectares of land, and 26 horses. After two years of collective production, by the end of 1953, this cooperative had transitioned from a primary to an advanced cooperative.
    Before transforming into an advanced cooperative, Shuguang Cooperative roughly met the following conditions: In terms of production, although suffering from a relatively severe flood in 1953, the yield per hectare was still 1,150 kilograms, an increase of more than 10 percent compared to local mutual aid teams. The average income of cooperative members increased by about 35 percent compared to before joining the cooperative. Even the members with the lowest income earned more than farmers outside the cooperative with similar conditions. The socialist economic accumulation also increased. By the end of 1953, the cooperative's public property reached 11,609 yuan (part of which was a bonus awarded by the government), with an average of 341 yuan per member. In terms of operation and management, the cooperative began implementing labor group operations in the first year of operation and promoted the small-scale contracting system. In 1953, it further promoted the "four fixed" method for permanent production teams (that is, fixing land, horses, farm tools, and labor in each production team). On this basis, a system of permanent contracting for work and output and rewards for overproduction was implemented. The calculation of workdays began to trial the piece-rate system. In terms of leadership, after two years of practical training in running the cooperative, a group of leading cadres had also been cultivated. By the end of 1953, ten management committee members had basically learned how to run the cooperative and were able to independently solve some problems. Most members, due to personally experiencing the benefits of running the cooperative for two years and receiving education on the general line, further improved their socialist awareness and actively demanded the transformation of the primary cooperative into an advanced cooperative.
    After two years of collective production, Shuguang Cooperative increasingly felt that the contradiction between unified management, collective labor, and private ownership of the means of production limited the further development of productivity. First, there was a waste of labor and animal power. In 1953, each laborer cultivated an average of 4.78 hectares of land, and each draught animal bore an average of 6.26 hectares of land. According to the situation at the time, each laborer could cultivate 5.5 hectares of land, and each animal could bear 7 hectares of land. Thus, the village's resources for expanding production (such as cultivable wasteland and usable water sources) could not be utilized. Why couldn't production be expanded? The main reason was that the poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and upper-middle peasants had different opinions. The poor peasants and lower-middle peasants actively demanded the expansion of the sown area, but some of the upper-middle peasants were not very interested in expanding the sown area. Because they felt that no matter how much production was expanded, the horse rental was fixed, and the land burdened by the horses would inevitably increase, which was detrimental to them, so they strongly advocated maintaining the status quo. They were also unwilling to engage in more sideline occupations, fearing that it would tire out the horses. Second, the increase in private means of production was slow or even stagnant. The cooperative only bought seven horses privately in the past two years. Some upper-middle peasants could have bought horses, but no one did. The poor peasants and lower-middle peasants wanted to buy horses but did not have the money. Third, some upper-middle peasants lacked enthusiasm for labor. Because they contributed more means of production to the cooperative, even if they worked less, they would receive more dividends than the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, some upper-middle peasants in the cooperative were "fishing for three days and drying nets for two days." According to statistics, the average labor attendance rate of upper-middle peasants was about 35 percent lower than that of poor peasants. Due to the above reasons hindering the further development of production, poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and party activists all demanded that the means of production be transferred from private to public ownership, and the primary cooperative be transformed into an advanced cooperative. Although the upper-middle peasants had some concerns about the transfer of the means of production from private to public ownership, they also felt that "collective farms are the direction, and we have to go there sooner or later," and were willing to follow. Their only requirement was to handle the issue of the means of production reasonably.
    The county party committee studied these issues and, with the approval of the provincial party committee, decided to lead the cooperative to transition from a primary to an advanced cooperative. The county and district party committees organized a work team to help the village branch carry out the work of transforming the cooperative.
    The main task of transforming this cooperative from a primary to an advanced cooperative was to resolve the issue of the public ownership of private means of production.
    1. Land: According to the opinions of the members, land was completely eliminated from remuneration. Because the local social land rent was relatively low, and there was more land, especially after two years of increased production, the members realized the principle that labor creates value, and the concept of private land ownership weakened, so they all agreed to eliminate land remuneration.
    2. Main means of production other than land: The cooperative purchased the privately owned draught animals of the members at the normal local price and transferred them to the public ownership of the entire cooperative. The price was repaid in installments, cleared in three years, and interest was paid at the bank rate. Large and medium-sized farm tools had been purchased and transferred to public ownership during the primary cooperative period.
    3. Share fund: The share fund determined by this cooperative was roughly equivalent to the price of the means of production such as draught animals purchased from the members and the price of forage, feed, and seeds. The method of paying the share fund was based on the labor force. Members who sold means of production such as draught animals to the cooperative could use the price that the cooperative should pay them to offset the share fund they should pay. The excess after offsetting was paid by the cooperative to the members, and the shortfall was paid by the members to the cooperative. It was also stipulated that the share fund paid by the members would be recorded in their personal names and would not accrue interest.
    4. Members' private plots and household sideline occupations: The total number of private plots of the members should not exceed 5 percent of the total land of the cooperative (only for use, not for sale). Those with a large population could keep less appropriately, and those with a small population could keep more appropriately. There were no restrictions on members raising pigs and poultry at home; they were also allowed to raise a small number of grazing cattle.
    After these issues were resolved, the cooperative was transformed from a primary to an advanced cooperative. Twenty-six households joined, with 35 male laborers, 23 female laborers, 33 draught horses, and 198.37 hectares of land.
    One year after Shuguang Cooperative transformed into an advanced cooperative, it showed greater superiority. In 1954, although the cooperative suffered a relatively severe drought (no rain for more than 70 days), it still achieved a good harvest. The total output of the cooperative reached 193,784 kilograms, exceeding the previous year by 3 percent. The unit yield per hectare was 976.5 kilograms, which was 15 percent lower than the previous year, but 25 percent higher than the output of other cooperatives in the village. The net dividend per workday was 1.17 yuan, exceeding the dividend per workday for members of other cooperatives by 50 percent. The income of 73 percent of the members of the cooperative increased compared to 1953. The increase for poor peasant members was even more significant. The income of 15 percent of the members was the same as the previous year. Only 12 percent of the members had a slightly lower income than in 1953 because they had more means of production and less labor before the transformation into an advanced cooperative.
    From the perspective of labor productivity, due to the continued implementation of the labor quota system and the adherence to the system of permanent contracting for work and output and rewards for overproduction in operation and management, the average workday of members in 1954 increased by 29.2 percent compared to 1953. Not only did the labor efficiency of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants improve, but also the labor efficiency of upper-middle peasants improved. For example, the workdays performed by Sun Huanqiang, an upper-middle peasant, in 1954 increased by 27 percent compared to 1953. Due to the increased enthusiasm of the members for labor, the role of draught animals in production was further enhanced. In 1954, the utilization rate of draught animals increased by 33.3 percent compared to 1953.
    Because production was doing well, many farmers demanded to join the cooperative. By the end of 1954, the number of households in the cooperative had increased to 157, the labor force had increased to 199, the land had increased to 1,013.69 hectares, and the number of horses had increased to 157. After the expansion of the cooperative, new developments were made in production in 1955, expanding the sown area by 23 hectares (including 7 hectares of paddy fields); increasing the planting of high-yield and stable-yield crops such as corn by 257 hectares, more than four times the previous year; further improving agricultural technology, expanding the area of autumn plowing to 285 hectares, more than seven times the previous year, stirring 270 hectares of wheat stubble twice with old plows (stirring once the previous year), and promoting improved varieties of wheat on 9.5 hectares. In order to maximize the potential of draught animals, in addition to expanding cultivated land and processing land, 37 old and weak draught animals were converted into grazing cattle, thus developing animal husbandry. Now the cooperative has a total of 39 grazing cattle, 26 horses, and more than 50 pigs, with a total value of 9,790 yuan, more than three times last year.
    This year, the total output of Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative reached 1,112,330 kilograms, with an average yield of 1,172 kilograms per hectare, exceeding the average yield of the cooperative's land in 1954 by 20 percent, and exceeding the average yield of the new members' land last year by 30 percent. This year, the income of 85 percent of the members increased compared to before joining the advanced cooperative, the income of only 10 percent of those with more means of production was the same as before joining the advanced cooperative, and the income of only 5 percent was lower than before joining the advanced cooperative. This year, the income per workday for members was 1.06 yuan, exceeding the income of new members last year by about 40 percent, but lower than the income of the original members by 15 percent. The reason for the low income is: investment in production next year has expanded, public property has increased, and more debts have been repaid. The agricultural machinery station opened up 300 hectares of wasteland for the cooperative this year (to be planted in 1956, including 200 hectares of paddy fields), and the seed cost alone required for expanding the cultivated area increased by 12,000 yuan; the public reserve fund was reserved for a total of more than 11,000 yuan, accounting for more than 8 percent of the total income, more than double the total amount of public reserve funds reserved by various cooperatives last year; and 5,000 yuan of national loans were repaid (loans not repaid last year). It is estimated that the total output in 1956 may exceed more than double this year's output, and the income per workday may reach 3.6 yuan, which is more than double that of 1954 (the increase in workday income exceeds the increase in grain output by one time because the value of high-value crops such as rice and improved varieties of wheat has increased. Therefore, although the output has increased by one time, the value has increased by two times). Therefore, if it were not for the huge expenditures for expanding production by withholding the above items, the income of the original members would have greatly exceeded the income of 1954.

    曙光农业合作社怎样由初级社转为高级社
    陈俊生　王连甲
    黑龙江省克山县曙光农业生产合作社是一九五二年在一个常年互助组的基础上建立起来的。当时全社共十七户，三十四个劳动力，一百六十二公顷七亩九分土地，二十六匹马。这个社经过了两年的集体生产，到一九五三年底已经由初级社过渡到高级社。
    曙光社在转为高级社以前，大致具备了这样一些条件：在生产方面，一九五三年虽然遭受较重的涝灾，每公顷产量还有一千一百五十公斤，比当地互助组增产百分之十以上。一般社员比入社前增加收入百分之三十五左右。收入最少的社员也比条件相同的社外农民收入多。社会主义的经济积累也有了增加。一九五三年底，全社公共财产达到一万一千六百零九元（其中有一部分是政府奖给的奖金），每个社员名下可均摊三百四十一元。在经营管理方面，这个社在办社第一年就开始实行了劳动分组作业，并且推行了小包工制。一九五三年又进一步推行了劳动组织的常年分队“四固定”的办法（就是把土地、马匹、农具、劳力固定在各个生产队里）。在这个基础上，实行了常年包工包产和超产奖励的制度。劳动日的计算开始试行了按件计工制。在领导力量方面，经过两年来办社的实际锻炼，也培养出来了一批领导骨干，到一九五三年底，有十个社务管理委员基本上学会了办社，能够独立解决一些问题。大多数社员由于两年来亲身体验到办社的好处，同时又受到了总路线的教育，社会主义觉悟有了进一步提高，积极要求把初级社转变为高级社。
    曙光社在进行了两年的集体生产以后，越来越感觉到统一经营、集体劳动同生产资料私有制之间的矛盾，限制了生产力的进一步发展。首先是劳动力和畜力有浪费。一九五三年平均每个劳力耕作土地四公顷七亩八分；每头耕畜平均负担六公顷二亩六分地。据当时情形看，每个劳力可耕作五公顷半地，每个畜力可负担七公顷地。这样本村有扩大生产的资源（如有可开垦的荒地，有可利用的水源）也不能利用。为什么不能扩大生产呢？主要是贫农、下中农和上中农的主张不一样。贫农和下中农积极要求扩大播种面积，上中农中间有些人对扩大播种面积却兴趣不大。因为他们感到不管生产扩大多少，马的租额是固定的，而扩大了播种面积，马负担的土地必然增多，这对他们是不利的，所以极力主张维持现状。他们也不愿意多搞副业，怕累坏了马。其次是私人生产资料增加得缓慢甚至停滞了。这个社两年来私人买进的马只有七匹，本来有一些上中农是可以买马的，但谁也不买。贫农和下中农想买马又没钱买。再次是一部分上中农劳动积极性不高。因为他们入到社内的生产资料多，就是少干一点活，分红也比贫农和下中农多，所以有的上中农在社内劳动是“三天打鱼，两天晒网”。据统计，一般上中农的劳动出勤率比贫农低百分之三十五左右。由于上述种种原因阻碍了生产的进一步发展，贫农、下中农和党员积极分子都要求把生产资料由私有转为公有，由初级社转为高级社。上中农虽然对生产资料由私有转为公有有一些顾虑，但是也感到“集体农庄是方向，早晚都得走”，愿意跟上去。他们唯一要求是把生产资料问题处理得合理。
    县委研究了这些问题并且经省委批准，决定领导这个社由初级社过渡到高级社，由县、区委组织工作组帮助村支部进行了转社工作。
    这个社由初级社转变为高级社的工作，主要是解决私人生产资料公有化的问题。
    一、土地：按照社员的意见，土地完全取消报酬。因为当地社会地租也比较低，土地也较多，特别是经过两年的增产，社员们认识到劳动创造价值的道理，土地私有观念淡薄了，所以都同意取消土地报酬。
    二、土地以外的主要生产资料：社员私有耕畜由合作社按照当地的正常价格收买，转为全社公有。价款分期偿还，三年还清，按银行利率付息。大中型农具在初级社时期就作价收买转为公有了。
    三、股份基金：这个社确定的股份基金大体相当于所收买的社员的耕畜等生产资料的价款和饲草、饲料、种子的价款。交纳股份基金的办法是按劳力摊的。向社出卖耕畜等生产资料的社员，可以用合作社所应该付给他的价款抵交他所应该交的股份基金，抵交以后多余的部分由合作社补付给社员，不足的部分由社员补交给合作社。并且规定，社员交纳的股份基金记在个人名下，不计利息。
    四、社员自留地和家庭副业：社员自留土地的总数不超过全社土地总数的百分之五（只能使用，不能出卖），人口多的可适当少留，人口少的可适当多留些。社员家里养猪、养禽不加限制；还允许养少量牧牛。
    上面这些问题解决以后，这个社就由初级社转成了高级社。加入的农户二十六户，男劳力三十五名，女劳力二十三名，耕马三十三匹，土地一百九十八公顷三亩七分。
    曙光社转为高级社一年以后，显示了更大优越性。一九五四年，这个社虽然遭受了较严重的旱灾（七十多天没下雨），仍然获得了较好的收成。全社总产量达十九万三千七百八十四公斤，超过了前一年的百分之三。每公顷地单位产量九百七十六点五公斤，虽然低于前一年百分之十五，但是超过全村其他社的产量百分之二十五。每个劳动日净分红一元一角七分，超过其他社社员每个劳动日分红百分之五十。全社百分之七十三的社员收入比一九五三年增加了。贫农社员增加的更为显著。有百分之十五的社员收入和上一年相等。只有百分之十二的社员因转高级社以前生产资料较多，劳力少，收入稍低于一九五三年。
    从劳动生产率看，由于在经营管理方面继续推行了劳动定额制度和坚持了常年包工包产超产奖励的制度，一九五四年社员平均劳动日比一九五三年增长了百分之二十九点二。不仅是贫农、下中农的劳动效率提高了，上中农的劳动效率也提高了，如上中农孙焕强一九五四年所作的劳动日比一九五三年增加百分之二十七。由于社员劳动积极性提高，更加发挥了耕畜在生产中的作用，一九五四年耕畜运用率比一九五三年提高百分之三十三点三。
    因为生产搞得好，许多农民都要求加入这个社。一九五四年底，这个社户数增加到一百五十七户，劳力增加到一百九十九个，土地增加到一千零十三公顷六亩九分，马增加到一百五十七匹。社扩大以后，一九五五年生产有了新的发展，扩大播种面积二十三公顷（其中水田七公顷）；增种高产、稳产作物玉米二百五十七公顷，超过上一年的四倍；进一步提高了农业技术，秋翻地面积扩大到二百八十五公顷，超过上一年的七倍，用旧犁把二百七十公顷麦槎搅两遍（上一年搅一遍），推广良种小麦九公顷半。为发挥耕畜潜力，除扩大耕地面积，进行土地加工外，把三十七头老弱耕畜转为牧畜，这样就发展了牧畜业，现在全社共有牧牛三十九头，马二十六匹，猪五十多口，总值达九千七百九十元，超过去年三倍多。
    今年，曙光农业生产合作社的总产量达一百一十一万二千三百三十公斤，平均每公顷产一千一百七十二公斤，超过一九五四年社里土地的平均产量百分之二十，超过新社员去年土地的平均产量的百分之三十。今年有百分之八十五的社员比入高级社前增加了收入，只有百分之十生产资料多的收入和入高级社前相等，收入低于入高级社前的只有百分之五。今年社员每个劳动日收入为一元零六分，超过新社员去年的收入百分之四十左右，但是低于原社员的收入百分之十五。低的原因是：来年生产投资扩大了，公共财产多了，还债多了。今年农业机器站给这个社开荒三百公顷（一九五六年种的，其中二百公顷水田），单是扩大耕地面积需要的种子费用即增加了一万二千元；公积金共留了一万一千多元，占总收入的百分之八以上，比去年各社留的公积金总数超过一倍以上；还国家贷款五千元（去年未还贷款）。估计一九五六年的总产量可超过今年的一倍多，每个劳动日收入可达到三元六角，即比一九五四年超过两倍多（劳动日收入的增加比粮食产量的增加超过一倍原因是水稻和良种小麦等价值高的作物增多，因此，产量虽然增加一倍，价值却增加二倍）。因此，如果不是扣留上述各项扩大生产的巨大开支，原社员的收入是会大大超过一九五四年的收入的。
