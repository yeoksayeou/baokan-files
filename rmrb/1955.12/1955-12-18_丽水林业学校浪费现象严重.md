To the Editor:

The extravagance and waste at the Lishui Forestry School in Zhejiang are very serious. When this school was first established in 1953, it purchased 138 mu of land, averaging over 137 square meters per student, far exceeding the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education; consequently, much of the land lies barren. However, they are not finding ways to utilize this land. This year, they even planned to purchase another 15 mu of land for a forest farm (which was later stopped by relevant leading organs). The school's power plant building is actually still usable, but seeing that there was a surplus in this year's capital construction funds, they built a new plant building under the pretext that the "original plant building was not sturdy" in order to avoid handing over the surplus, wasting more than 3,500 yuan. The school originally had a dining hall that doubled as an auditorium, but this year they built separate auditorium and dining hall buildings, wasting more than 19,300 yuan. In addition, due to blind procurement, there is also a lot of stockpiled material. According to statistics, the materials stockpiled in just the laboratory, medical clinic, and other five departments are worth more than 12,000 yuan, and some of the medicines stored in the medical clinic can last for forty or fifty years, or even more than a hundred years.

This school also uses illegal means such as forging reimbursement forms and arbitrarily changing plans approved by higher authorities to defraud the state of construction funds. For example, they have consistently falsely reported stipends for students during vacations. According to preliminary statistics, they falsely reported nearly 2,000 yuan during the three vacations of the winter vacation of 1953 and the summer and winter vacations of 1954. For example, in the third-quarter funding plan this year, the approved cost for repairing pigsties was 500 yuan, but without consultation, they demolished the original pigsties and built new tiled-roof, cement-floor pigsties, resulting in a cost of more than 1,000 yuan. As another example, they wanted to install fluorescent lights in the classrooms, but the Ministry of Forestry did not approve it when reviewing the plan, but they still purchased the fluorescent lights.

What is particularly intolerable is that some leaders of the Lishui Forestry School are indifferent to such extravagance and waste and violations of financial discipline, even considering them to be "trivial matters." I believe that the Ministry of Forestry should conduct an inspection and rectification of the Lishui Forestry School.

### 丽水林业学校浪费现象严重

    丽水林业学校浪费现象严重编辑同志：
    浙江丽水林业学校铺张浪费现象十分严重。这个学校在一九五三年刚建立的时候就购买了一百三十八亩土地，每个学生平均用地一百三十七平方公尺以上，大大超过高等教育部的规定；因此，有很多土地就荒芜着。但是，他们对这些土地并不设法利用。今年反而又计划购买土地十五亩作林场（后来被有关领导机关制止了）。这个学校的电厂厂房实际上还可以使用，但是他们看到今年基本建设工程的经费有结余，为了避免上缴，就用“原有厂房不坚固”作借口，另建了厂房，浪费了三千五百多元。学校里原有一座膳厅兼礼堂，今年又新建了礼堂和膳厅各一座，浪费了一万九千三百多元。此外，由于盲目采购，积压的物资也很多。据统计，仅实验室、医务室等五个部门积压的物资就值一万二千多元，医务室储存的某些药品竟可以用四、五十年甚至一百多年。
    这个学校还用假造报销单据和随意变更上级批准的计划等非法手段，来骗取国家的建设资金。例如，他们一贯虚报假期的人民助学金，据初步统计，在一九五三年的寒假和一九五四年的暑假、寒假三个假期中就虚报了将近二千元。又如今年第三季度的经费计划中批准他们修缮猪舍的费用是五百元，但是他们没有经过请示就擅自把原来的猪舍拆除，新建瓦房水泥地的猪舍，结果花了一千多元。再如，他们要在教室里安装日光灯，林业部审核计划的时候没有同意，但是他们仍然购置了日光灯。
    特别令人不能容忍的是，丽水林业学校的某些领导人员对于这种铺张浪费现象和违反财政纪律的行为居然毫不在意，甚至认为是些“鸡毛蒜皮”的事情。我认为，林业部应该对丽水林业学校进行检查和整顿。　　　　　　潘子江
