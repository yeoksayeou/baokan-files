　　The nineteen collective farms experimentally established in Heilongjiang Province have achieved universal good harvests this year. The rice production of eight farms, including Xinghuo, Liaoyuan in Huachuan County, and Dongfanghong in Dongning County, averaged between 8,000 and 11,000 jin per hectare, an increase of about 20% in unit yield compared to last year, and 1,000 to 1,500 jin more grain per hectare than the local elementary agricultural producers' cooperatives this year. The other incomes of the farms have also increased. These farms have not only prioritized fulfilling the farms' obligations to the state and accumulated public funds, but also increased the personal income of the members. The seven farms of Shuguang, Fujin, and Hongxing in Keshan County, each member received an average of about 300 to 500 yuan; the two farms of Hongguang and Liaoyuan in Huachuan County, the average male member received about 900 yuan, and the female member received 300 to 450 yuan; in the mechanized Xinghuo Collective Farm, the average male laborer received 1,350 yuan, and the stronger female laborers also received 1,080 yuan. Currently, these nineteen farms are earnestly summarizing this year's production experience and planning for the expansion of production next year. (Yan Youcai)

    黑龙江省十九个集体农庄普遍丰收
    黑龙江省试办的十九个集体农庄，今年普遍获得丰收。桦川县的星火、燎原和东宁县的东方红等八个农庄的水稻，每垧平均产量都在八千斤到一万一千斤左右，比去年单位产量增加百分之二十左右，比今年当地初级形式的农业生产合作社每垧多产粮食一千斤到一千五百斤。各农庄的其他收入也有增加。这些农庄不但优先完成了农庄对国家的义务，积累了公共基金，庄员的个人收入也增加了。克山县的曙光、富锦、红星等七个农庄，每个庄员平均分三百元到五百元左右；桦川县的红光、燎原两个农庄，平均每个男庄员分九百元左右，女庄员分三百元到四百五十元；机械化作业的星火集体农庄，平均每个男劳动力分一千三百五十元，劳动力较强的女庄员也分到一千零八十元。目前，这十九个农庄正在认真总结今年的生产经验，进行明年扩大生产的规划工作。（阎有才）
