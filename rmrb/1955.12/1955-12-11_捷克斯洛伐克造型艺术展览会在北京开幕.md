Xinhua News Agency, December 10th—The Czechoslovak Republic Fine Arts Exhibition opened on the 10th at the Cultural Hall of the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing. The exhibition includes more than 400 pieces of art, including oil paintings, sculptures, prints, cartoons, and propaganda posters.

Through these artistic treasures, the exhibition provides a comprehensive introduction to the history of Czechoslovak art since the 13th century. During these seven hundred years, Czechoslovak art experienced the development of the Czech Gothic period in the 14th century, becoming a major school of European art. The Czech Baroque painting and sculpture, which rose between the 17th and 18th centuries, had a stronger national style and realistic color. In the early 19th century, with the rise of the national independence movement, Czechoslovakian artworks increasingly reflected the face of the revolutionary struggle at that time. After the Great October Revolution, the creation of socialist realism became the goal of the Czechoslovak people's artists. After World War II, Czechoslovak art achieved glorious development in the era of the people's regime.

Those who visited the exhibition today included Ding Xilin and Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Culture; Liu Aifeng, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education; Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; and figures from the cultural and artistic circles, such as Liu Kaiqu, Cai Ruohong, Ge Baoquan, and Wang Chaowen. Diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China were also invited to visit the exhibition.

The Czechoslovak Republic Fine Arts Exhibition in Beijing is organized by the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations in accordance with the 1955 Implementation Plan of the Sino-Czech Cultural Cooperation Agreement and will continue until December 31. These exhibits were previously exhibited in Nanjing and Shanghai before coming to Beijing.

    捷克斯洛伐克造型艺术展览会在北京开幕
    新华社十日讯　捷克斯洛伐克共和国造型艺术展览会十日在北京苏联展览馆文化馆开幕。会上展出的艺术作品包括油画、雕塑、版画、漫画和宣传画等共四百多件。
    展览会通过这些艺术珍品，概括地介绍了捷克斯洛伐克艺术自十三世纪以来发展的历史。在这七百年间，捷克斯洛伐克的艺术曾经经历了十四世纪的捷克哥特式时期的发展，成为欧洲艺术的一个主要流派。在十七、八世纪之间兴起的捷克巴若克式的绘画和雕塑，民族风格和现实主义的色彩更为浓厚。十九世纪初期，随着民族独立运动的风起云涌，捷克斯洛伐克艺术作品越来越多地反映了当时革命斗争的面貌。伟大的十月革命以后，社会主义现实主义的创作成了捷克斯洛伐克人民艺术家努力的目标。在第二次世界大战以后，捷克斯洛伐克艺术在人民政权的年代里又得到了光辉的发展。
    今天参观展览会的有文化部副部长丁西林、郑振铎，高等教育部副部长刘皑风，北京市副市长张友渔以及文化艺术界人士刘开渠、蔡若虹、戈宝权、王朝闻等。各国驻华外交官员也应邀参观了展览会。
    北京的捷克斯洛伐克共和国造型艺术展览会是对外文化联络局根据中捷文化合作协定一九五五年执行计划举办的，将继续举行到十二月三十一日。这些展品在来北京展出之前，曾先后在南京和上海展出。
