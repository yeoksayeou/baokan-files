Xinhua News Agency, December 16th. The Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued the following statement on December 16, 1955:

    Recently, US Secretary of State Mr. Dulles and other US official spokespersons have repeatedly and groundlessly accused the Chinese side of not fully fulfilling the agreement reached during the Sino-American ambassadorial talks on the issue of the return of civilians. The Chinese government believes it is necessary to issue the following statement to explain the truth.

    The Chinese side has consistently and faithfully implemented the agreement reached in the Sino-American talks on the issue of the return of civilians. It is the US side that has not fully fulfilled the agreement and has taken actions that violate the agreement.

    1. At the beginning of the Sino-American ambassadorial talks, the Chinese side submitted to the US side a list and information of all Americans in China and made a clear explanation to the US side. However, the US side has not yet provided our side with a list and information of all Chinese in the United States. Therefore, after the Sino-American talks reached an agreement on the issue of the return of civilians, the government of the Republic of India, entrusted by China, did not have enough materials to fully carry out the task of assisting Chinese in the United States to return to their country. Our side has sufficient reason to request the government of the Republic of India to understand the situation of Chinese in the United States through the Indian Embassy in the United States, investigate the facts that they are being hindered from leaving the country, and assist them in returning to their country. However, the US government stated that it could not provide any assistance to the Indian Embassy in the United States in this regard. The US side claimed that the Indian Embassy in the United States could only contact Chinese nationals after they themselves made a request. Although our side does not agree with the US side's interpretation of the agreement, under the circumstances that the US side insists on this approach, our side certainly cannot grant the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, entrusted by the United States, rights that exceed reciprocity. Our side is not satisfied with the situation that the third country entrusted by both China and the United States cannot actively contact nationals of each side. However, the US side does not have any right to make any accusations against the Chinese side on this issue, because this situation is precisely created by the US side. If the US side wants to change this situation, it should first provide our side with a list and information of all Chinese in the United States and agree to assist the Indian Embassy to contact them proactively.

    2. The US side has repeatedly raised the issue of Americans imprisoned in China. It should be pointed out that the Americans imprisoned in China are Americans who have violated Chinese laws. They cannot talk about returning to their country during their sentences, and there is no issue of being hindered from returning to their country. Our side stated during the Sino-American talks that the Chinese government will, in accordance with Chinese legal procedures and based on their own performance, review each case individually and take lenient measures. Since the Sino-American talks began on August 1, 26 of the 40 Americans who violated the law have been released. That is to say, two-thirds of the law-breaking Americans have been released in a period of more than four months. The Chinese government is also continuing to review the cases of the remaining law-breaking Americans one by one.

    On the other hand, the US side has never notified our side of how many Chinese have been imprisoned in the United States, nor has the US side ever submitted their list to our side. This not only makes it impossible for our side to conduct verification, but also makes it impossible for the Indian Embassy to provide them with any assistance.

    3. The US side has also repeatedly raised the issue of the speed at which China releases law-breaking Americans. As early as before the Sino-American talks reached an agreement on the issue of the return of civilians, the Chinese side clearly stated that Americans who violate the law in China must be dealt with in accordance with Chinese legal procedures, and there can be no deadline for the release of law-breaking Americans. This is China's sovereignty. The US side also repeatedly stated during the Sino-American talks that it respects Chinese legal procedures and has no intention of undermining China's sovereignty. Therefore, the US side has no reason to demand a deadline for the release of law-breaking Americans after the agreement is reached, or to implicitly demand a deadline for the release of law-breaking Americans. Moreover, in fact, our side is releasing law-breaking Americans as quickly as possible. However, on the other hand, the US side has not taken any corresponding measures for any Chinese imprisoned in the United States.

    4. As for general American nationals, their return to their country has never been hindered. Since the Sino-American talks began, the Chinese side has also assisted all American nationals who wish to return to their country in quickly handling their unfinished affairs so that they can return to their country as soon as possible. Since August 1, all 16 American nationals who applied to return to their country out of a total of 59 general American nationals have been allowed to leave the country. Among these 16 people, there are still three who have not left China because they still have unfinished business of their own, and the Chinese side is still doing its best to provide assistance. Other American nationals can leave at any time they wish to return to their country, and will receive the same assistance. However, on the other hand, even among the 103 Chinese who the US side admits have long requested to return to their country but have been prevented from leaving by the US government for a long time, there are still 38 who have not returned to China. The US side claims that they have been allowed to leave the country, but the US side has never provided their addresses, nor has it explained why they have not returned to their country, and has also refused to assist the Indian Embassy in understanding their situation.

    5. The US side not only has not provided our side with a list of all Chinese in the United States, not only refuses to give the Indian Embassy the necessary assistance, but has also recently stipulated that Chinese students who continue to reside in the United States must obtain Taiwan entry permits. This is clearly a further threat to Chinese students who cannot return to their country for the time being, so that they will not dare to request to return to mainland China in the future. As early as April 2 this year, the US State Department admitted in a public statement that "some Chinese students are afraid to apply to the Immigration and Naturalization Service to leave the United States for fear of being rejected." Now, the US side has not only failed to take appropriate measures to eliminate their concerns caused by long-term obstruction and threats, but has also taken further threatening measures against them. This is a direct violation of the letter and spirit of the agreement between the two sides on the issue of the return of civilians.

    The US side's accusation that China has not fully fulfilled the agreement is completely untenable. The Chinese government firmly demands that the US side cease all actions that violate the agreement and fully implement the agreement between the two sides.

### 我外交部发言人发表声明  说明美国违反两国平民回国问题协议真相

    我外交部发言人发表声明
    说明美国违反两国平民回国问题协议真相
    新华社十六日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人一九五五年十二月十六日发表声明如下：
    最近，美国国务卿杜勒斯先生和其他美国官方发言人一再毫无根据地指责中国方面没有充分履行中美两国大使级会谈关于两国平民回国问题所达成的协议。中国政府认为有必要发表以下的声明，说明事实真相。
    中国方面一贯忠实地实施中美会谈中双方对平民回国问题所达成的协议。没有充分履行协议、而且采取了违反协议的行为的正是美国方面。
    一、在中美两国大使级会谈开始的时候，中国方面就向美方提交了全部在中国的美国人的名单和情况，并且向美方作了清楚的交代。但是，美方却至今没有向我方提供全部在美国的中国人的名单和情况。因此，中美会谈对双方平民回国问题达成协议后，中国所委托的印度共和国政府没有足够的材料来充分执行协助在美国的中国人回国的任务。我方有充分的理由要求印度共和国政府通过印度驻美大使馆了解在美国的中国人的情况，调查他们离境受到阻碍的事实并且协助他们回国。但是，美国政府却又表示不能在这方面给予印度驻美大使馆任何协助。美方声称，只有在中国侨民本人提出要求后，印度驻美大使馆才能同他们接触。我方虽然不同意美方对于协议的这种解释，但是，在美方坚持这种做法的情况下，我方当然不能给予美国所委托的英国驻华代办处以超过对等的权利。对于中美双方所委托的第三国不能主动同各方侨民联系的情况，我方是不能满意的，但是美方没有任何权利在这一问题上对中国方面进行任何指责，因为这种情况正是美方所造成的。美方如果要改变这种情况，就应该首先向我方提供全部在美国的中国人的名单和情况，并且同意协助印度大使馆主动同他们联系。
    二、美国方面一再提出在中国被监禁的美国人的问题。应该指出，在中国被监禁的美国人是违犯了中国法律的美国人，他们在服刑期间谈不到回国的问题，更不发生回国受到阻挠的问题。我方在中美会谈中曾经声明，中国政府将根据中国的法律程序，按照他们本人的表现，逐个进行审查，采取宽大的措施。自从八月一日中美会谈开始以来，在四十名犯法的美国人中，已经有二十六名被释放。这就是说，在四个多月的期间已经有三分之二的犯法美国人获释。对于其余的犯法美国人，中国政府也正在继续进行逐个审查的工作。
    另一方面，美方从来没有通知我方究竟有多少中国人被监禁在美国，美方也从来没有向我方提交他们的名单。这不仅使我方无法进行查对，而且也使印度大使馆无法对他们进行任何协助。
    三、美国方面还一再提出了中国释放犯法美国人的速度问题。早在中美会谈对双方平民回国问题达成协议以前，中国方面就明确声明，在中国犯法的美国人必须按照中国的法律程序处理，不可能有任何释放犯法美国人的期限。这是中国的主权。美方在中美会谈中也一再声明尊重中国的法律程序，无意损害中国的主权。因此，美方也没有任何理由在协议达成后提出限期释放或者变相地提出限期释放犯法的美国人的要求，而且，事实上，我方正在侭速地释放犯法的美国人。但是另一方面，美方对于任何监禁在美国的中国人却并没有采取任何相应的措施。
    四、就一般的美侨来说，他们的回国从来没有受到阻挠。自从中美会谈开始以来，中国方面还协助了所有愿意回国的美侨侭速料理他们的未了事务，使他们能够早日回国。八月一日以来，在五十九名一般美侨中，全部十六名申请回国的美侨都获准离境。在这十六人中现在还有三名没有离开中国，那是由于他们自己还有未了的事务，中国方面也还在尽力给予协助。其他的美侨，在他们愿意回国的任何时候，都可以随时离境，并且也将获得同样的协助。但是，另一方面，即使在美方承认早就要求回国而长期被美国政府阻止不能离境的一百○三名中国人中，至今还有三十八名没有回到中国。美方声称，他们已经获准离境，但是美方从来没有交代他们的地址，也没有交代他们为什么没有回国，而且还拒绝协助印度大使馆了解他们的情况。
    五、美国方面不仅没有向我方提供全部在美国的中国人的名单，不仅拒绝给予印度大使馆以应有的协助，而且最近还规定继续居留在美国的中国学生必须取得台湾入境证。这显然是对一时还不能回国的中国学生作进一步的威胁，使他们在将来不敢提出回到中国大陆的要求。早在今年四月二日，美国国务院就在公开声明中承认，“有些中国学生由于害怕遭受拒绝而不敢向移民归化局申请离开美国。”现在，美国方面不仅没有采取适当的措施消除他们由于长期遭受阻难和威胁而产生的顾虑，而且还进一步对他们采取威胁的措施。这是直接违反双方关于平民回国问题的协议的文字和精神的。
    美国方面对于中国没有充分履行协议的指责是完全不能成立的。中国政府坚决要求美方终止一切违反协议的行为，充分履行双方的协议。
