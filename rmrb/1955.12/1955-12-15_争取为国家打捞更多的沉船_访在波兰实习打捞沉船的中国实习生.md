    Strive to Salvage More Shipwrecks for the Country
    ——An Interview with Chinese Interns Interning in Poland to Salvage Shipwrecks
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Warsaw, Xie Wenqing
    Salvaging ships and steel plates sunk in the oceans and rivers is of great significance to the development of transportation. People's Poland has outstanding achievements and innovations in this undertaking that requires highly advanced and complex technology. The Polish Salvage Company has already salvaged several giant seagoing vessels with displacements of tens of thousands of tons from deep waters. According to the Sino-Polish technical and technological cooperation agreement, the Ministry of Communications of the People's Republic of China sent seven salvage workers to Poland in May this year to intern in salvaging shipwrecks. The Chinese interns received the cordial care and guidance of Polish comrades during their studies in Polish seaports such as Gdynia. Polish engineers and technicians imparted their technical theories, practical experience, and specific operating methods to the Chinese interns without reservation. These Chinese interns have returned to their motherland at the end of November to strive to salvage more shipwrecks for the country.
    During the underwater electric welding operations, Polish technicians always held the interns' hands and patiently guided them in the deep water. Polish diver Janga said that when he learned underwater electric welding in the old society, he could only watch from a distance behind the teacher, who always used "danger" to prevent him from actual operation. Dr. Hayel, who is proficient in diving theory and diving technology, introduced to the interns the medical methods he created for treating diving diseases. Using this medical method can prevent and more quickly cure various diseases caused by underwater work. For example, the use of a "decompression chamber" can cure divers' high-pressure sicknesses, which they are prone to when working underwater, in two or three days.
    Comrade Stakiewicz, who is in charge of the engineering supervision of several salvage sites, travels back and forth between the various sites day and night, but he still makes time to lecture the interns. In order to explain a calculation formula and a physical phenomenon, Stakiewicz always tries his best to ensure that the interns fully understand it. For example, in order to explain how divers pull their feet out of deep mud, he lectured on a lot of mechanics knowledge, which greatly inspired the interns theoretically.
    In order to enable the interns to learn more technical and scientific knowledge, the Polish Salvage Company formulated a detailed theoretical lecture and practical operation plan according to the interns' requirements, assigned 25 experts and technicians to give special lectures and on-site guidance, and also gave the interns the latest Polish books on salvage theory and technology. Chinese interns learned and mastered some new operation methods, such as lightweight diving, which can reduce the diver's weight and make underwater work extremely convenient. Using the "sea horizontal echo sounder," a clever instrument for finding shipwrecks, can quickly and accurately determine the location of shipwrecks on the boundless sea. Even if there is a short iron wire on the seabed, this instrument can accurately find it. The use of underwater telephones can greatly improve work efficiency. In the past, Chinese divers only used signals to communicate with the surface underwater, which was greatly restricted, but Polish underwater telephones allow divers to talk freely with surface workers, and also allow divers to talk freely with each other. In addition, Chinese interns have also fully mastered technical operations such as underwater blasting and underwater lighting. The interns also imitated models of various advanced Polish tools, such as pontoons, decompression chambers, rivet guns, automatic mud attackers, underwater lighting lamps, and air distribution boxes. These advanced tools and operating methods selflessly imparted by Polish teachers to Chinese students will greatly promote the development and improvement of Chinese salvage technology.
    Chinese interns participated in the planned production work of the Polish Salvage Company with a sense of ownership, and their diligence, inquisitiveness, and responsible work spirit left a good impression on their Polish friends. Comrade Zhang Xiaomao was often called "our little Pasha captain" by Polish comrades because he was constantly working on a small motorboat. In order to enable the interns to learn more practical experience in Polish shipwreck salvage, the Polish Salvage Company specially adopted an unusual salvage method when salvaging a small 600-ton nautical freighter in 20 meters of water, with Chinese interns participating in the operation. This method does not require underwater righting during salvage, nor does it require a speed control cylinder, and is a method that only people with rich experience dare to boldly adopt. However, the Chinese interns skillfully completed their tasks. In addition, they also participated in the work of salvaging an 8,000-ton shipwreck with pontoons. The technical design made by Chinese interns for salvaging a 13,000-ton shipwreck at a depth of 50 meters was reviewed by Polish experts and considered feasible.
    Comrade Zhang Zhiqiu, the person in charge of the Chinese interns, said when talking about their six-month internship gains in Poland: According to our existing technical knowledge, given that the equipment conditions permit, it is not too difficult to salvage shipwrecks with a displacement of 10,000 tons at a depth of 50 meters. Due to the mastery of the operation of various advanced tools, it is also possible to greatly reduce laborious work and improve salvage efficiency. The interns also studied the salvage engineering and technical issues of certain ships sunk in China's deep waters with Polish experts. The Chinese interns are very grateful to the Polish comrades for their help. After six months of internship in Poland, they returned to their motherland with rich gains and full confidence. The advanced experience of the Polish people will be applied to China's construction cause through their introduction.

    争取为国家打捞更多的沉船
    ——访在波兰实习打捞沉船的中国实习生
    新华社驻华沙记者　谢文清
    打捞沉在海洋和河流中的船只和钢板，对交通事业的发展具有重要意义。人民波兰在这个要求高度和复杂的技术科学的事业中有着优异的成绩和创造。波兰打捞公司已经在深水中打捞起几艘排水量重达几万吨的巨型海船。根据中波技术与技术科学合作协定，中华人民共和国交通部在今年五月间曾经派了七名打捞员工到波兰实习打捞沉船。中国实习人员在波兰琴尼亚等海港学习中得到了波兰同志的亲切的关怀和教导。波兰工程技术人员把他们的技术理论、实际经验、具体操作方法都毫无保留地传授给中国实习生。这些中国实习生已经在十一月底返回祖国，争取为国家打捞更多的沉船。
    在实习水下电焊的操作中，波兰技工们总是扶着实习生的手在深水中耐心指导。波兰潜水员扬加说，他在旧社会学水下电焊的时候，只能够在老师身后老远的地方看，老师总是用“危险”来阻止他实地操作。精通潜水理论和潜水技术的医生哈耶尔同志向实习生介绍了他所创造的治疗潜水病症的医疗方法，采用这种医疗方法就可以防止和更快地治好各种水下工作的病症。例如，采用“缓压箱”，就能在两三天内治好潜水员在水下操作时容易患的高压病。
    负责好几个打捞工地的工程监督工作的斯塔凯维奇同志，不分昼夜地来往于各个工地之间，但是他仍然挤出时间来为实习生讲课。为了说明一个计算公式和一个物理现象，斯塔凯维奇总是想尽方法使实习生全部理解贯通。比如，为了说明潜水员如何把陷在深泥里的脚拔出来，他就讲了许多力学知识，使实习生从理论上得到很大的启发。
    为了使实习生学到更多的技术和科学知识，波兰打捞公司根据实习生的要求制定了详细的理论讲授和实习操作计划，指派了二十五位专家和技工分别作专题讲授和实地指导操作，还把波兰最新的关于打捞理论和技术的著作赠给实习生。我国实习生学习并且掌握了一些新的操作法，如轻装潜水法可以使潜水员身上的负重减轻，在水下工作极为方便。使用“海上水平回声仪”这一寻找沉船的灵巧仪器，可以迅速而准确地在一望无边的海面上确定沉船的位置，即使海底有一根短铁丝，这种仪器也可以准确地找到它。水下电话的使用可以大大提高工作效率。过去中国潜水员只在水下用信号和水面联系，受到很大限制，而波兰的水下电话却可以使潜水员和水面上的工作人员自由通话，还可以使各个潜水员之间自由通话。此外，中国实习生也完全掌握了如水下爆炸、水下照明等技术操作。实习生还仿造了波兰各种先进工具的模型，如浮筒、缓压箱、铆钉枪、自动攻泥器、水下照明灯、空气分配箱等。波兰老师无私地传授给中国学生的这些先进工具和操作方法将大大地促进中国打捞技术的发展和提高。
    中国实习生以主人翁的态度参加了波兰打捞公司的计划生产工作，他们的勤学好问和积极负责的工作精神给波兰朋友们留下了良好的印象。章筱毛同志因为经常架着小汽艇工作不停，波兰同志都把他叫做“我们的巴夏小船长”。为了使实习生学习更多的波兰打捞沉船的实际经验，波兰打捞公司在二十公尺水下打捞一艘六百吨重的小型航海货轮的时候，特地采取了一种不平常的打捞方法，由中国实习生参加操作。这种方法在打捞时不必进行水下搬正，也不用止速筒，是必须具有丰富经验的人们才敢于大胆采用的方法。但是，中国实习生熟练地完成了自己的任务。此外，他们还参加了用浮筒打捞一艘八千吨沉船的工作。中国实习生所作的在五十公尺水深处打捞一万三千吨沉船的技术设计，经过波兰专家审核后认为切实可行。
    中国实习生负责人张智魁同志在谈到他们在波兰六个月的实习收获时说：按照我们已有的技术知识来说，在设备条件允许的情况下，在五十公尺水下，打捞排水量万吨重的沉船已经没有多大困难，由于掌握了各种先进工具的操作，在打捞中还可大大减轻费力劳动和提高打捞效率。关于沉在中国深水中的某些船只的打捞工程和技术问题，实习生也同波兰专家作了研究。中国实习生十分感谢波兰同志给他们的帮助。他们在波兰经过六个月的实习后，带着丰富的收获和充沛的信心回到祖国去了。波兰人民的先进经验将经过他们的介绍而运用到中国的建设事业上。
