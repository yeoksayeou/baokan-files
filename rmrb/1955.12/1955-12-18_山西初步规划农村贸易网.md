To adapt to the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has made preliminary overall plans for the rural trade network accordingly.

This preliminary plan stipulates that the existing primary-level supply and marketing cooperatives should be comprehensively adjusted. In market towns, six specialized outlets will generally be set up for production materials, general merchandise, fabrics, non-staple food, groceries, and medicine. In addition to meeting the needs of the market town residents, these outlets will also promptly allocate goods to subordinate retail units and be responsible for the transformation of private merchants in related industries. Each market town cooperative will be attached to purchasing stations, processing plants, livestock service departments, and canteens. In central natural villages about ten li away from the market town and with about one hundred households, two to four supplier stores will be established to supply the daily consumer goods needed by the masses; in natural villages about ten li away from the market town and five li away from the supplier store, with more than fifty households, two fixed sales agents will be set up to supplement the supplier stores; in remote small villages with less than fifty households, the market town cooperative and the supplier store will organize mobile teams to supply goods to their doorsteps.

The plan also makes unified arrangements for developing supply and marketing cooperative members and transforming rural private merchants.

After this plan is implemented, by the end of 1956, Shanxi Province will have 1,000 new-type market town supply and marketing cooperatives, 95 new-type rural department stores, 6,000 specialized outlets, 3,500 supplier stores, 2,000 fixed sales agents, and about 3,000 attached institutions. At that time, private commerce, accounting for about 90% of the total number of rural private merchants, will be transformed into various forms of cooperative commerce, basically realizing the semi-socialist transformation of rural private commerce. By 1957, the number of supply and marketing cooperative members will reach more than 90% of the population that should join the cooperative.

    山西初步规划农村贸易网
    为适应农业合作化运动的大发展，山西省供销合作社对农村贸易网初步作出了相应的全面规划。
    这个初步规划，规定要对现有的基层供销合作社全面地加以调整。在集镇上一般将分设生产资料、百货、布匹、副食、杂货和医药等六个专业性的门市部。这些门市部除了要满足上集群众的需要以外，还要及时调拨商品给所属零售单位，并且负责有关行业私商的改造工作。各集镇社将附设采购站、加工厂、牲畜服务部和食堂等。离集镇十里左右、百户上下的中心自然村，将设立二至四个供应商店，供应群众日常消费资料；距集镇十里、离供应商店五里左右、五十户以上的自然村，将分设二个固定代销员，以补充供应商店的不足；五十户以下的偏僻小村，由集镇社和供应商店组织流动组，上门供应。
    对发展供销合作社社员和改造农村私商等工作，规划中也作了统一的安排。
    这个规划实现以后，到一九五六年底，山西省将有新型的集镇供销社一千个，新型的农村百货商场九十五座，专业门市部六千个，供应商店三千五百个，固定代销员二千个，附设机构三千个左右。那时，占农村私商总人数的百分之九十左右的私营商业将转变为各种合作形式的商业，基本上可以实现对农村私营商业的半社会主义改造。到一九五七年，供销合作社社员将达到应入社人口的百分之九十以上。
