    I Guarantee to Complete Five Years of Production Tasks in Four Years
    To the Editor:
    Under the education and cultivation of the Party, for the past three years, I have always completed the state's production plan ahead of schedule: in 1953, two and a half months ahead of schedule; in 1954, four months and nine days ahead of schedule; this year, I also completed the task ahead of schedule, making my workload in the first three years of the Five-Year Plan completed nine months ahead of schedule. The average product quality reached over 98.5%, exceeding the state's stipulated targets. I will continue to work hard. According to the calculation that the production tasks in the next two years will increase by half compared to the current level, I will complete five years of production tasks in four years.
    How can I complete the production tasks ahead of schedule? It all depends on diligently learning advanced experiences. In 1953 and 1954, I successively learned the Kressov tool sharpening method, the Unanov universal tool sharpening method, and the Shirov drilling method, and other Soviet advanced experiences, which increased the efficiency of processing 679 universal tool milling machines and 6321, 6322 rotary tables by 50%, and the drilling efficiency increased from three minutes to half a minute per hole. In the past three years, I have learned six advanced experiences, improved thirteen kinds of tools and thirty-two kinds of operating methods, which played a great role in my completing the tasks ahead of schedule and ensuring product quality. I only joined the Ma Hengchang group this year. In the past, I worked with cast iron, and now I started cutting lead screws, and the angle of the tool was not well controlled; therefore, when cutting the 6H82 universal milling machine and the 7152 large lead screw, the first piece was scrapped. I consulted with other masters, found out the reason, learned a lesson, improved my skills, and achieved the result of scrapping only one out of forty-nine pieces cut. In the first half of this year, when processing the 0034 rotary table for the vertical milling head, because none of the three batches of products processed by other lathes in the past were qualified, I paid attention to solving the quality problem and jointly tested it three times with veteran forging worker Wang Zhanxue and technicians, and improved the "core support" tool, which enabled the quality of this product to reach the required precision.
    In order to achieve my goal, I must continue to humbly learn various advanced experiences, especially applying the experiences of learning the Unanov universal tool sharpening method, intermittent cutting method, dial, etc., to all processing components. I guarantee to complete ten hours of work quota every day, and I will also carefully study technical documents, strengthen unity with other comrades, and help each other. In addition, I must fully prepare for production, and ensure that the average flexible time reaches seven and a half hours every day (including preparation work).

### 我保证用四年时间完成五年生产任务

    我保证用四年时间完成五年生产任务编辑同志：
    在党的教育和培养下，三年以来，我总是提前完成了国家的生产计划：一九五三年提前两个半月，一九五四年提前四个月零九天；今年，也提前完成了任务，使得我在五年计划中前三年的工作量提前九个月完成了。产品质量平均达到百分之九十八点五以上，超过了国家规定的指标。我还要继续努力。按照后两年的生产任务比目前增加一半来计算，我要在四年时间内完成五年的生产任务。
    我怎么能够提前完成生产任务的呢？全靠努力学习先进经验。我在一九五三年和一九五四年先后学习了克列索夫车刀法、乌纳诺夫万能车刀法、希洛夫钻孔法等苏联先进经验，使加工六七九万能工具铣床和六三二一、六三二二回转台的效率提高了百分之五十，钻孔效率从三分钟提高到半分钟一个。在三年里，我学习了六种先进经验，改进了十三种工具和三十二种操作方法，对于我提前完成任务和保证产品质量起了很大作用。我是今年才调到马恒昌小组的。过去我干生铁活，现在开始削丝杠，刀的角度掌握不好；因此在切削六H八二万能铣床和七一五二大丝杠的时候，头一个活就报废了。我就找别的师傅研究，找出原因，接受教训，提高了技术，做到了切削四十九个活只废一个。今年上半年加工立铣头零零三四回转台的时候，由于过去别的车床加工三批产品没有一件是合格的，因此我就注意解决质量问题，同锻件老工人王占学和技术人员共同试验了三次，改进了“芯胎”工具，才使这个产品的质量达到了精度。
    为了实现我的奋斗目标，我一定要继续虚心学习各种先进经验，特别是把学习乌纳诺夫万能车刀法、分断切削法、刻度盘等经验，运用到所有加工部件上去。我每天保证要完成十小时的工时定额，并且要认真钻研技术文件，同其他同志加强团结，互相帮助。此外，还要充分做好生产前的准备工作，每天机动时间保证平均达到七点三十分（准备工作在内）。
