At a joint conference of township Party branch secretaries in the Tongxian area, Su Guoliang, director of the Tongxian Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, discussed two situations in rural supply and marketing work:

    One is that the supply and marketing departments are hesitant in managing livestock, so the plan for supplying livestock has been revised repeatedly. The original plan was to supply 2,000 head of livestock, which was later increased to 6,000 head. Now, more than 6,390 head have actually been sold, but the requirements of cooperatives in various places still cannot be met. The double-wheel double-铧 plow was also repeatedly added to the plan, and more than 6,000 units have now been sold, exceeding the original plan, and various places are still asking for continued supply. This shows that there is a situation where supply and marketing work is "falling behind."

    The other is that the supply and marketing departments transported a batch of ivory chopsticks, perfume essences, and various canned meats to the countryside. Cooperative members and farmers certainly know the uses of these things, and they will use them one day. However, cooperative members and farmers know even better that they must now run the cooperatives diligently and frugally. If the cooperatives are run well, when we reach socialism, we can not only use ivory chopsticks, perfume essences, and eat canned meat, but also buy sofas, pianos, and other better things. This also shows that there is a situation where supply and marketing work is "overshooting."

    Whether it is "falling behind" or "overshooting," it reflects that these supply and marketing cooperatives have not yet established the idea of serving cooperativization, and are still standing outside the cooperativization movement or on the edge of the movement. In this way, they can only blindly purchase and sell goods. In fact, this situation not only exists in the Tongxian area, but also in other areas. Therefore, all localities should check and correct it, so that supply and marketing work can stand in the cooperativization movement.

### “赶不上”和“赶过头”

    “赶不上”和“赶过头”
    在通县地区的乡支部书记联席会议上，河北省供销合作社通县办事处主任苏国良曾谈到农村供销工作中的两种情况：
    一种是供销部门在经营牲畜上小手小脚，因此供应牲畜的计划一再修改，原计划供应牲畜二千头，后来增加到六千头。现在实际上已经销售到六千三百九十多头，可是还不能满足各地合作社的要求。双轮双铧犁也是一再追加计划，现在已经销出了六千多部，超过了原计划，各地还在要求继续供应。这说明了供销工作有赶不上的情况。
    一种是供销部门给农村运去了一批象牙筷子、香水精、各种肉罐头。合作社社员和农民当然知道这些东西的用处，也有一天会使用这些东西。不过合作社社员和农民更知道现在必须勤俭办社，办好了社，到了社会主义，不但可以用象牙筷子、香水精、吃罐头肉，而且可以购置沙发、钢琴等等更好的东西。这又说明了供销工作有赶过头的情况。
    不论是“赶不上”或“赶过头”，都反映了这些供销社还没有树立起为合作化服务的思想，还站在合作化运动之外或者站在运动的边沿上。这样，当然只能盲目地进货、销货。事实上，这种情况不只是通县地区存在，其他地区也同样存在。因此，各地都应当检查和纠正，使供销工作站到合作化运动中去。
