    Refuting Dulles' Fallacies

    Dulles has stated more than once that the United States also opposes colonialism and boasted that the United States "does not have" colonies in Asia. But when the Soviet leaders, who were visiting India and Burma, criticized colonialism and condemned countries that had invaded Asia and still maintained colonies in Asia, Dulles cried out as if his sore spot had been touched. This cry exposed Dulles' true colors.

    The Soviet leaders condemned the Portuguese colonialists' intention to maintain their colony of Goa on Indian territory and supported the Indian people's efforts to recover Goa. This position of standing with the oppressed people was not only warmly welcomed by the Indian people but also sincerely supported by the broad masses of Asian people. It is understandable that the Portuguese colonialists felt very uncomfortable because of this. But this should at least not cause unease in the United States, which has always flown the banner of anti-colonialism.

    However, the United States became uneasy, and Dulles came out to speak. On December 2, Dulles and Portuguese Foreign Minister Cunha issued a joint communiqué refuting the Soviet leaders' assertion that Goa was Indian territory, asserting that Goa was a "province of Portugal in the Far East."

    Although this joint communiqué has aroused the indignation of the Indian and Asian people, Dulles still felt it was not enough. On December 6, Dulles reiterated this argument at a press conference and volunteered to act as a spokesman for the world, saying, "The whole world considers it (Goa) a province of Portugal." Moreover, he further said that in addition to Goa, "there are two other places in India" and the so-called "Macau province" on the Chinese coast are all "parts of territory" that Portugal "governs as 'provinces' according to Portuguese law."

    The "whole world" in the mind of this US Secretary of State is obviously many times smaller than the actual world. Because, at least, India, China, and the Soviet Union, which account for more than half of the world's population, do not have the same view as Dulles on the status of Goa and Macau. Dulles' so-called "the whole world thinks" can at best represent the United States and a small group of colonialists supported by the United States.

    Whose territory is Goa? Whose territory is Macau? The Indian and Chinese people know better than anyone else, and they don't need the US Secretary of State to judge. Dulles is not qualified to point fingers at the Indian and Chinese people. Even if Dulles repeats his fallacies ten or even a hundred times, he cannot change the facts or shake the determination of the Indian and Chinese people to recover their territory.

    However, it cannot be said that Dulles' words have no benefit at all. The benefit of these words is to make the Asian people clearly see that in their anti-colonialist struggle, the United States firmly stands on the side of the colonialists and is the leader of this group of ferocious colonialists.

    Under the condemnation of the Indian people and the people of the world, the Portuguese colonialists were so guilty that they dared not speak out themselves and sought help from the United States, and Dulles stepped forward to defend Portugal's colonialist aggression. Dulles even openly stated at the press conference that the joint communiqué he issued with the Portuguese Foreign Minister was the result of "very careful consideration" and was "not issued rashly." The implication is that the United States is prepared to bear all the consequences arising therefrom with Portugal. In this way, Dulles acted as the protector of the colonial system, serving as Portugal's bodyguard, and wanted to use the "strength" of the United States to intimidate the Asian people and force the Asian people to continue to endure colonialist exploitation and enslavement. In this way, Dulles stripped off all the beautiful disguise of anti-colonialism of the United States and nakedly exposed his ugly face as a colonialist.

    Even so, Dulles still tried to use some nice words to disguise himself. He said that the reason why he came out to make a big fuss on the Goa issue was because the Soviet leaders' remarks criticizing colonialism in India showed that they "did not have a specific desire to ease the tension there." It seems that opposing colonialism hinders the easing of the situation in Asia.

    Dulles' argument can only be heard by colonialists, but the Asian people will not listen to it.

    The Asian people see very clearly that the current tension in Asia is caused by the aggressive actions of the United States in attempting to establish its colonial rule in Asia. The United States obstructs the peaceful settlement of the Korean and Indochina issues; indefinitely occupies Japan and forces Japan to rearm; invades China's Taiwan and creates tension in the Taiwan Strait; organizes military blocs in Southeast Asia and engages in war preparations of "Asians fighting Asians"; organizes the so-called "Northern Tier Defense" in the Middle East and provokes relations between Middle Eastern countries and between Middle Eastern countries and the Soviet Union. The purpose of the United States is to turn the vast Asian region into its colony and suppress the Asian people's struggle for independence and freedom. It is precisely this aggressive behavior of the United States that has caused turmoil in the Asian situation and seriously threatens the peace of Asia and the independence and security of Asian countries.

    The people of Asian countries are willing to coexist peacefully and cooperate with each other. However, the aggressive activities of the United States and other colonial countries hinder the realization of this desire of the Asian people. Only by eliminating colonial rule in Asia and letting Asians handle their own affairs can Asia achieve lasting peace and increasing prosperity. The Asian people are increasingly aware that the struggle against colonialism is an inseparable part of the struggle to ease the situation in Asia and maintain peace in Asia. The achievements of the Asian-African Conference clearly demonstrate this understanding of the Asian and African people.

    Therefore, contrary to Dulles' argument, the Soviet leaders' criticism of colonialism is a powerful support for the Asian people's struggle for peace and against colonialism, and this support is obviously conducive to easing the situation in Asia. And what Dulles fears most is precisely the far-reaching impact caused by the Soviet leaders' visit to Asian countries. This impact cannot but be conducive to the consolidation of peace in Asia and the struggle of the Asian people for independence and freedom, thereby giving a heavy blow to the US's aggressive conspiracy. Dulles' actions in supporting the Portuguese colonialists are a manifestation of the United States' panic in the face of this prospect of the Asian situation, and its delusion to reverse the development of the situation by exerting pressure on the Asian people.

    However, the era when the United States could use "strength" to scare the Asian people has long passed. If Dulles wants to use threats and intimidation to reverse the torrent of the Asian people's opposition to colonialism, it can only prompt the Asian people to strengthen their will and determination to oppose US aggression.

### 斥杜勒斯的谬论

    斥杜勒斯的谬论
    杜勒斯不止一次表示过美国也反对殖民主义，夸耀过美国在亚洲“没有”殖民地，但是当正在访问印度和缅甸的苏联领袖们抨击殖民主义，谴责曾经侵略过亚洲并且还在亚洲保有殖民地的国家的时候，杜勒斯却像被人碰着了他的痛处那样大叫起来了。这一叫可就暴露了杜勒斯的真相。
    苏联领袖们谴责葡萄牙殖民者想在印度领土上保持自己的殖民地果阿的打算，支持印度人民为收复果阿而作的努力，这种同被压迫人民站在一起的立场，不但受到印度人民的热烈欢迎，而且受到广大亚洲人民的衷心的拥护和支持。葡萄牙的殖民主义者因此感到很不痛快，这是可以理解的事情。但是这似乎至少不应该引起一向打着反对殖民主义的旗号的美国的不安。
    然而美国竟然不安起来了，而且杜勒斯出来说话了。十二月二日，杜勒斯和葡萄牙外交部长库纳发表了一项联合公报，驳斥苏联领袖们关于果阿是印度领土的说法，断言果阿是“葡萄牙在远东的省份”。
    尽管这项联合公报已经引起了印度人民和亚洲人民的愤慨，杜勒斯却还觉得不够。十二月六日，杜勒斯在记者招待会上重申了这个论调，并且毛遂自荐地充当全世界的发言人说，“全世界都认为它（果阿）是葡萄牙的一个省。”而且，他还进一步说，除了果阿以外，“在印度还有其他两个地方”以及中国沿海的所谓“澳门省”，都是葡萄牙“根据葡萄牙法律当作‘省份’加以治理”的“一些不同部分的领土”。
    这位美国国务卿的心目中的“全世界”，显然比实际的世界要小到不知道多少倍。因为，至少，印度、中国、苏联这三个占世界人口一半以上的国家，对于果阿和澳门的地位并不具有同杜勒斯一样的观点。杜勒斯的所谓“全世界都认为”怎样怎样，顶多也只能代表美国的和靠美国支持的一小撮殖民主义者罢了。
    果阿是谁的领土？澳门是谁的领土？印度人民和中国人民知道得比谁都清楚，用不着美国国务卿来加以判断。杜勒斯没有资格来对印度人民和中国人民指手划脚。杜勒斯即使把他的谬论再重复十遍以至一百遍，也改变不了事实，动摇不了印度人民和中国人民收回自己领土的决心。
    但是，不能说杜勒斯这些话没有一点好处。这些话的好处就是使亚洲人民清楚地看到：在他们的反殖民主义的斗争中，美国坚决地站在殖民主义者的一边，而且是这一群凶恶的殖民主义者的领头人。
    在印度人民和世界人民的谴责之下，葡萄牙殖民主义者们做贼心虚到甚至不敢自己出来讲话，去向美国求救，而杜勒斯就挺身而出，卫护葡萄牙的殖民主义侵略行为。杜勒斯在记者招待会上甚至公然说，他和葡萄牙外交部长发表的联合公报是经过“非常仔细的考虑”，“不是轻率发表的”。言下之意就是美国准备同葡萄牙承担由此引起的一切后果。杜勒斯这样就俨然以殖民制度的保护人自居，充当葡萄牙的保镖，想用美国的“实力”来恫吓亚洲人民，迫使亚洲人民继续忍受殖民主义的剥削和奴役。这样，杜勒斯就剥掉了美国的一切反殖民主义的漂亮伪装，赤裸裸地暴露了自己的殖民主义者的丑恶嘴脸。
    虽然这样，杜勒斯还企图用一些漂亮话来给自己进行掩饰。他说他之所以出来在果阿问题上大放厥辞，是因为苏联领袖们在印度抨击殖民主义的言论说明他们“并没有和缓那里的紧张局势的具体愿望”。似乎反对殖民主义就阻挠了亚洲局势的和缓。
    杜勒斯的这种论调只有殖民主义者才听得进，亚洲人民是听不进的。
    亚洲人民看得很清楚，目前亚洲紧张局势就是美国企图在亚洲建立它的殖民统治的侵略行为所造成的。美国阻挠朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的和平解决；无限期占领日本，强迫日本重新武装；侵占中国的台湾，在台湾海峡制造紧张空气；在东南亚组织军事集团，进行“亚洲人打亚洲人”的战争准备；在中东组织所谓“北层防御”，挑拨中东国家之间和中东国家同苏联之间的关系。美国的目的就是要把广大亚洲地区变成它的殖民地，镇压亚洲人民争取独立自由的斗争。正是美国的这种侵略行为造成了亚洲局势的动荡不安，严重地威胁着亚洲的和平和亚洲各国的独立和安全。
    亚洲各国人民愿意和平共处，互相合作。但是美国和其它殖民国家的侵略活动却阻碍着亚洲人民的这个愿望的实现。只有消除在亚洲的殖民统治，让亚洲人处理亚洲自己的事情，亚洲才能获得持久和平和日益繁荣。亚洲人民已经越来越认识到，反对殖民主义的斗争是和缓亚洲局势、维护亚洲和平的斗争的不可分的一部分。亚非会议所取得的成就清楚地表明了亚非人民的这种认识。
    因此，恰恰同杜勒斯的论调相反，苏联领袖们对殖民主义的抨击，是对亚洲人民争取和平、反对殖民主义斗争的有力支持，这种支持显然有利于亚洲局势的和缓。而杜勒斯所最害怕的恰恰就是苏联领袖们访问亚洲国家所引起的深远影响，这种影响不能不有利于亚洲和平的巩固，有利于亚洲人民争取独立自由的斗争，从而给予美国的侵略阴谋以沉重的打击。杜勒斯支持葡萄牙殖民主义者的行动，正是美国在亚洲局势的这种远景前面惊慌失措、妄想用对亚洲人民施加压力来扭转局势发展的一种表现。
    但是，美国可以用“实力”来吓唬亚洲人民的时代早已过去了。杜勒斯要想用威胁恫吓来扭转亚洲人民反对殖民主义的洪流，只能促使亚洲人民加强他们反对美国侵略的意志和决心。
