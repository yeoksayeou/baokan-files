Xinhua News Agency, December 13th - Currently, large private factories nationwide with more than 500 employees have basically implemented joint state-private ownership. According to statistics from the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce, at the end of 1953, there were still 176 large private factories with more than 500 employees nationwide. By the end of October this year, more than 70 percent of them had become joint state-private enterprises. Since November, another group of these large private enterprises has applied for joint state-private ownership. In areas where the work of joint state-private ownership has progressed relatively quickly or where there are not many large factories, such as Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and provinces like Hebei, Yunnan, and Guizhou, the joint state-private ownership of all these large factories has already been completed.

These large private factories are mostly distributed in large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, and provinces such as Jiangsu, Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Guangdong. They mainly belong to light industrial production sectors such as cotton spinning, silk reeling, match manufacturing, and cigarette manufacturing, and are closely related to people's lives. Since 1950, these factories have successively accepted state processing orders and purchasing and marketing arrangements, becoming intermediate forms of state capitalist enterprises.

Because these large factories have relatively complete equipment and more advanced technology, they have played a leading role in the implementation of joint state-private ownership of the entire private industry, driving a group of medium and small factories to carry out mergers and joint operations together. For example, when the largest private Shenxin Textile Printing and Dyeing Co., Ltd. and the private Yong'an Textile Printing and Dyeing Co., Ltd. implemented joint state-private ownership in September this year, they merged four small factories with simple buildings, outdated machines, and insufficient technical strength, such as Sanming and Weichang, so that the production of each factory was developed. When the private Dadong Tobacco Co., Ltd. implemented joint state-private ownership, under the leadership of the People's Government, it also merged Guohua Cigarette Factory and Dayunlong Cigarette Factory, etc., to become the joint state-private Dadong Cigarette Factory.

### 全国大型私营工厂已基本上实行公私合营

    全国大型私营工厂已基本上实行公私合营
    新华社十三日讯　目前全国五百人以上的大型私营工厂已经基本上实行了公私合营。据中央工商行政管理局的统计，在一九五三年底全国还有五百人以上私营大型工厂一百七十六个，到今年十月底，它们之中已有百分之七十以上变成公私合营企业。自十一月份以来，这些大型私营企业又有一批申请公私合营。其中公私合营工作开展得较快或大型工厂不多的地方，如天津、广州、武汉等市和河北、云南、贵州等省，已经全部完成了这些大型工厂的公私合营工作。
    这些私营大型工厂大都分布在上海、天津、广州、重庆等大城市和江苏、四川、浙江、广东等省。它们主要是属于棉纺织、缫丝、火柴、卷烟等轻工业生产部门，和人民生活的联系比较密切。从一九五○年以后，这些工厂曾经先后接受国家的加工订货和收购包销，成为中级形式的国家资本主义企业。
    这些大型工厂由于设备比较完整、技术比较先进，所以在私营工业实行全行业公私合营的时候，它们都起了带头作用，带动一部分中、小型工厂一道进行合并合营。如全国最大的私营申新纺织印染厂股份有限公司和私营永安纺织印染股份有限公司在今年九月实行公私合营的时候，就把三明、纬昌等四个厂房简陋、机器陈旧、技术力量不足的小厂合并进去，使各厂的生产都得到发展。私营大东烟草股份有限公司在实行公私合营时也在人民政府的领导下，把国华烟厂、大运隆烟厂等合并进去，成为公私合营大东烟厂。
