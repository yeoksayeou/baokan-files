Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 1st. The Indonesian News Agency reported that the Chairman of the Indonesian Investigation Committee responsible for investigating the “Kashmir Princess” plane crash, Imawang, reaffirmed the committee's findings on November 29th. Imawang said that the plane crash that resulted in the deaths of staff members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference and Chinese journalists was caused by criminal activity. Careful laboratory studies confirmed that the plane crash was the result of sabotage involving the placement of explosives on the plane. Imawang added that the experts from the Douglas Aircraft Company who participated in the investigation also agreed with this conclusion.

Imawang said that a 160-page investigation report with photographs had been submitted to the Indonesian government at the end of July. The report recommended that if the case were to be tried in Hong Kong, some members of the Indonesian Investigation Committee should be given the opportunity to act as witnesses.

    印度尼西亚调查委员会主席
    谈印度失事飞机调查结果
    新华社雅加达一日电　印度尼西亚新闻社报道，负责调查“克什米尔公主号”飞机失事事件的印度尼西亚调查委员会主席伊马汪十一月二十九日再次肯定了委员会的调查结果。伊马汪说，使参加亚非会议的中国代表团工作人员和中国新闻记者身亡的飞机坠毁事件是由于犯罪行为所造成的。实验室的仔细研究证实，飞机坠毁事件是在飞机上放置爆炸物进行破坏的结果。伊马汪又说，参加调查的道格拉斯飞机公司的专家也同意这个结论。
    伊马汪说，附有照片的一份一百六十页的调查报告已经在七月底交给印度尼西亚政府。这个报告建议，如果案件在香港审理的话，要给印度尼西亚调查委员会某些委员充当证人的机会。
