156 Overseas Chinese from Japan Return Home
Over 100 Remains of Anti-Japanese Martyrs Simultaneously Transported Back

Xinhua News Agency: One hundred and fifty-six overseas Chinese from Japan returned to the motherland on the 9th aboard the Japanese ship "Xing An Maru."

Welcoming the returning overseas Chinese at Tianjin Xingang Pier were Zhang Shuming, member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, Zhang Gancheng, Director of the General Office, Li Shizeng, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee, and more than 300 people from all walks of life in Tanggu District. Before the returning overseas Chinese disembarked, Li Shizeng delivered a welcoming speech to all returning overseas Chinese over the loudspeaker, welcoming them to overcome numerous difficulties and return to participate in the construction of the great motherland. At this time, thunderous applause erupted from the overseas Chinese on the ship and the welcoming people on the pier. Everyone also enthusiastically sang "Unity is Strength."

After disembarking, the returning overseas Chinese changed to cars and drove to Tianjin. Along the way, they saw the newly built factories, workers' dormitories, and vast fields of the motherland from the car windows, and happily sang "Ode to the Motherland."

That evening, the returning overseas Chinese attended a welcome banquet held by the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee.

Xinhua News Agency: One hundred and thirty-one remains of Chinese anti-Japanese martyrs who sacrificed during the Anti-Japanese War in Japan were transported back to Tianjin Xingang on the 9th aboard the Japanese ship "Xing An Maru." The delegation escorting the remains of the Chinese anti-Japanese martyrs, headed by Takekazu Katsuo, accompanied the ship.

A grand ceremony to welcome the remains of the anti-Japanese martyrs was held at Tianjin Xingang Pier. Participants included Ji Feng, Director of the International Liaison Department of the Red Cross Society of China, Zhou Shujia, Deputy Secretary-General of the Buddhist Association of China, Li Yunge, President of the Tianjin Branch of the Red Cross Society of China, and representatives from various people's organizations in Tianjin, the People's Liberation Army garrisoned in Tianjin, and people from all walks of life in Tanggu, totaling more than 400 people.

Li Yunge delivered a speech at the ceremony. He first expressed his condolences to the deceased anti-Japanese martyrs and expressed his deep gratitude to the Japanese representatives, the Japanese people, and the overseas Chinese in Japan who overcame various difficulties to collect the remains of the Chinese martyrs and escort them to China. He said that the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Association had made many efforts in assisting overseas Chinese in Japan to return to their country, in negotiating with the Japanese authorities to release Hong Jinshan and other five overseas Chinese who voluntarily returned to their country, and in ensuring that they could return to their country in the near future. This time, Takekazu Katsuo and other representatives escorted the remains of the Chinese anti-Japanese martyrs to China, which is also a manifestation of friendly spirit.

Takekazu Katsuo then spoke. He first apologized for the inhumane acts committed by Japanese militarism against China in the past. He said that there has been significant development in the recent exchanges between China and Japan. We deeply appreciate the profound friendship of the Chinese government and people. We are willing to learn the spirit of the Chinese people and devote all our strength to peaceful endeavors.

After the ceremony, the remains of the anti-Japanese martyrs were transported by car to the Tianjin Anti-Japanese Martyrs' Memorial Hall for storage.
