The design branch of the Ministry of Railways responsible for designing the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway recently meticulously calculated during the railway's technical design and construction material design phases, reducing the engineering cost by over 120 million yuan while ensuring quality.

The various production sections of this design branch launched a labor competition in the third quarter, universally increasing the work enthusiasm of the staff and strengthening investigation and research. Employees of the construction organization budget section conducted thorough on-site investigations, revising the preliminary design guidelines and saving 73.55 million yuan for the entire line. Staff members of the large-scale construction section proposed 36 cost-reduction suggestions, reducing investment by 12.4 million yuan. Engineers in the housing construction section used locally sourced red sandstone produced along a certain section of the railway line instead of bricks to build walls, reducing costs by 12.6 yuan per cubic meter, with a quality even better than brick construction. During the design of four stations, the station yard section, after repeated investigations and research, created a new design, reducing earth and stone excavation by more than 190,000 cubic meters, saving an investment of 252,800 yuan.

    鹰厦铁路工程造价降低
    担任鹰厦铁路设计工作的铁道部某设计分局，最近在铁路技术设计和施工资料设计中精打细算，使工程造价在保证质量前提下降低了一亿二千多万元。
    这个设计分局的各生产科从第三季度展开了劳动竞赛，工作人员普遍提高了工作积极性，并且加强了调查研究工作。施工组织预算科的职工深入现场周密调查，修改了初步设计总则，使全线节约投资七千三百五十五万元。大型建筑科工作人员提出三十六项降低造价的建议，减少了一千二百四十万元投资。房屋建筑科的工程师们就地取材，采用沿线某段出产的红砂岩，代替砖料砌墙，使每立方公尺降低成本十二元六角，质量比砖砌的还好。站场科在设计某四个车站时经过多次调查研究，作出新的设计，共减少土石方工程十九万多方，可节约投资二十五万二千八百元。
