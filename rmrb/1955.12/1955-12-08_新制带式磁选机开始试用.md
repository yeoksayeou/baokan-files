	Newly Made Belt Magnetic Separator Begins Trial Use
	Workers at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, based on Soviet technical data, have successfully trial-produced a new type of belt magnetic separator. In mid-November, it was tested at Anshan Iron and Steel, and its performance proved to fully meet design requirements.
	This belt magnetic separator can automatically separate ore particles with different iron content into concentrate, middlings, and tailings (old-style magnetic separators could not be divided into grades, and even the better ones could only be divided into two grades). It is an indispensable and important piece of equipment for modern ore dressing plants. Depending on the size of the ore particles, one belt magnetic separator can process from nine to thirty-five tons of ore per hour. This is a major contribution by the workers of the Mining Machinery Factory to the mining and metallurgical industry of the motherland. The electrical equipment on this magnetic separator was manufactured with the assistance of workers from the Shenyang Electrical Appliance Factory. The Mining Machinery Factory, according to the needs of all parties, has decided to continue producing a batch of belt magnetic separators before the end of the year.

    新制带式磁选机开始试用
    沈阳矿山机器厂职工根据苏联技术资料，试制成功一种新型的带式磁选机，十一月中旬经鞍钢试用，证明其性能完全合乎设计要求。
    这种带式磁选机可以把含铁成分不同的矿粒自动选别为精矿、中矿、尾矿（旧式磁选机不能分成等级，较好的也只能分两等），是近代化选矿厂不可缺少的重要设备。按矿粒大小，一台带式磁选机每小时可选矿九吨到三十五吨。这是矿山机器厂职工对祖国采矿冶金工业的一个重大贡献。这台磁选机上的电气装置是由沈阳市电器制造厂职工协助制造的。矿山机器厂根据各方面的需要，已决定在年前继续生产一批带式磁选机。
