Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 6th. When Katayama Tetsu, head of the Japanese "National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution," left Shenzhen for Hong Kong on his way back to Japan, he issued the following written statement to our agency's reporter before leaving China:

    I. We believe that our expectations for promoting the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan and enhancing the friendship and goodwill between the two peoples have been greatly achieved due to the signing of this joint communiqué and related cultural exchange agreements. After returning to our country, we will make further efforts based on the above spirit.

    II. We believe that in order to achieve the above goals, first of all, Japan needs to defend the peaceful constitution to the end. We cannot be satisfied with the one-third of the strength that the pro-constitution faction currently holds in the Diet (because of the existence of this force, rearmament cannot be carried out publicly under the current constitution); I am determined to make greater efforts to further strengthen and expand this force, and wait for such an opportunity to arrive. At the same time, we must also carry out the movement against rearmament and in support of the peaceful constitution more deeply among the masses. We believe that by upholding the constitution, the friendship and goodwill between the Chinese and Japanese peoples can be achieved.

    III. We believe that it is necessary for the peoples of the two countries, who have the same script, many similarities in long-term culture, life, and customs, and even more similarities in economy, to further deepen mutual understanding. In this sense, we are very pleased to think that our visit to your country has indeed made us feel that seeing is believing, and it is very meaningful.

    IV. Your country has already started the first ever project to fundamentally control the Yellow River, and has also begun to build the Yangtze River Bridge, which was previously considered impossible to build. At the same time, highways or railways leading to the border areas of Tibet and Xinjiang have also been opened to traffic or are in the planning stage. This great national construction plan is truly amazing.

    In addition, in terms of policies towards ethnic minorities, we have seen the establishment of ethnic minority colleges under cordial leadership plans, and ethnic minority arts are being protected, which makes us deeply feel that human happiness will be realized here under the light of modern civilization.

    We are very happy to see that workers' cultural palaces, children's palaces, and other recreational places for the working people are being built everywhere.

    We used to think that solving the problem of ethnic minorities and building cultural palaces was a dream, and it was difficult to realize, but now we are surprised to see that these are already in front of us.

    V. What makes those who hope to understand the history and culture of ancient China happy is that China has extremely complete facilities for protecting cultural heritage. We visited cultural heritage sites of ancient history in various places, and we were particularly interested in the chronological classification display method of the Shanghai Museum.

    VI. Great efforts are being made to reform the writing system. We have seen that the adoption of horizontal writing, simplified characters, the popularization and research of ethnic minority scripts, and other tasks are being gradually implemented, and we believe that this is a huge undertaking.

    The above are a few main impressions. Here, we would like to extend our heartfelt respect to the Chinese people who are fighting with great enthusiasm for the construction of the country. We also sincerely thank you for the deep friendship and warm welcome we have received in various places during this month-long visit to China.

    Finally, I wish the success of China's construction cause and the happiness and peace of everyone, as my parting words.

    Long live the friendship and goodwill between the Chinese and Japanese peoples!

    片山哲离华回国时发表书面谈话
    新华社广州六日电　日本“拥护宪法国民联合会”访华团团长片山哲离开深圳取道香港回国的时候，向本社记者发表了离华前的书面谈话，全文如下：
    一、我们相信，我们所期望的促进中日邦交的恢复和增进两国人民的友好亲善，由于这次联合公报和有关文化交流的协议的签订，而获得了很大成就。我们回国以后将根据上述精神作进一步的努力。
    二、我们认为：为了实现上述目的，首先，日本需要将和平宪法维护到底，我们不能满足于拥护宪法派在目前的国会中占有的三分之一的力量（由于这种力量的存在，在现行宪法下不能公开进行重整军备）；我决心为进一步加强和扩大这个力量而作更大的奋斗，并且等待这种机会的到来。同时，我们还要更加深入地在群众中开展反对重整军备和拥护和平宪法的运动。我们相信，通过拥护宪法就可使中日两国人民的友好亲善获得成就。
    三、我们认为，具有同样文字，在长期的文化、生活、习惯方面有很多相似的地方，以及在经济上有更多相似的地方的两国人民，有必要进一步加深相互间的理解。从这种意义说来，我们很高兴地认为我们的访问贵国，的确使我们感到百闻不如一见，很有意义。
    四、贵国已在着手于有史以来第一次的根治黄河的工程，并且也已经在着手建设过去认为不可能建设的长江大桥。同时，通向西藏和新疆边境地区的公路或铁路也已经通车或在计划中，这种伟大的国家建设计划实在令人惊异。
    此外在少数民族政策方面，我们看到在亲切的领导计划下设立了民族学院、民族艺术得到保护，使我们深深感到在现代文明的光芒下，人类的幸福将要在此地实现。
    我们看到各地正在兴建工人文化宫、少年宫等等劳动人民的休息场所，觉得非常高兴。
    我们过去一直认为少数民族问题的解决和建立文化宫是个梦想，是难以实现的，但现在却惊异地看到这一些已经呈现在眼前。
    五、使希望了解古代中国的历史和文化的人们感到高兴的是：中国具有极为完善的保护文化遗产的设施。我们在各地参观了古代历史上的文化遗产，其中上海博物馆按照年代的分类陈列法尤其使我们感到兴趣。
    六、对文字改革尽着极大的努力。我们看到横排、简体字的采用，少数民族文字的普及和研究等项工作正逐步付诸实施，我们认为这是一件巨大的事业。
    以上是几点主要的感想。我们在这里仅向抱着极大的热情为建设国家而奋斗的中国人民致以由衷的敬意。并且衷心感谢在这一个月的访华期间中对我们表示的深厚的友情和各地的热烈欢迎。
    最后敬祝中国建设事业的成功和各位的幸福和平安，作为我临别的话。
    中日两国人民友好亲善万岁！
