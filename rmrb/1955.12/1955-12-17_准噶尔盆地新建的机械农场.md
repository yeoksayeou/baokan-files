    Newly Built Mechanical Farm in the Junggar Basin
    Qilian Shan
    A new type of state-owned mechanical farm has recently appeared forty kilometers west of Shawan County town in the Junggar Basin.
    As late as the end of spring and the beginning of summer this year, this place was still a wilderness frequented by gazelles and wolves. Among the thickets of tamarisk and camel thorns, there were still tents of the wasteland survey team and the water conservancy survey team. In the summer, the construction of the farm began. Trucks transported timber from the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, and steel bars, cement and other building materials from Urumqi. In just a few months, the factory buildings of the tractor repair and assembly plant and the flour mill have been erected in the center of the farm. Male and female soldiers of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps have moved into hundreds of newly built villa-style houses. At night, electric lights began to appear. Around the farm headquarters, canals and roads crisscross. The water of the Manas River, diverted by a sixty-five-kilometer canal, has brought new life to this vast virgin land. The first winter wheat planted has grown green and lovely.
    This farm has a total land area of 180,000 mu, of which 140,000 mu are cultivated. Twenty-nine large field crop rotation areas, mainly for cotton, and thirteen feed crop rotation areas have now been planned. There are main and auxiliary forest belts between the crop rotation areas. In late October, the soldiers planted a total of 320,000 trees in various forest belts.
    At present, the soldiers are working hard on various preparations for cultivation. When the spring breeze thaws the ground next year, they will show their skills in this newly built farm.

    准噶尔盆地新建的机械农场
    祁连山
    准噶尔盆地沙湾县城以西四十多公里的地方，最近出现了一座新型的国营机械农场。
    今年春末夏初的时候，这里还是常有黄羊、狼群出没的荒野。在那红柳、骆驼刺丛生的地方，还点缀着荒地勘测队和水利勘测队的帐篷。夏季，建场工作开始了。载重汽车从天山北麓运来了木材，从乌鲁木齐运来了钢筋、水泥等建筑材料。短短几个月的时间，到现在，农场的中央已经矗立起拖拉机修配厂和面粉厂的厂房。新疆军区生产建设部队的男女战士们已经搬入数百幢新落成的别墅式的房屋。夜里，开始出现了电灯亮光。场部四周，水渠和道路纵横。六十五公里渠道引来的玛纳斯河河水，为这片辽阔的处女地带来了新的生命。第一次种下的冬麦，已经生长得绿油油的十分可爱。
    这座农场共有土地十八万亩，其中耕地面积有十四万亩。现在已经规划出二十九个以棉花为主的大田轮作区，十三个饲料作物轮作区。各轮作区之间都有主副林带。十月下旬，战士们在各林带共种树三十二万株。
    目前，战士们正在紧张地进行着各种备耕工作。到明年春风解冻的时候，他们就要在这新建的农场里大显身手了。
