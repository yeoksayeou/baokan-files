    During the visit of N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and N.S. Khrushchev, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, to Kabul, discussions were held on the issues of trade and economic relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.

    They also agreed that it is necessary to further develop and expand these ties in the interests of both countries.

    To achieve this goal, the Soviet and Afghan governments believe that it is necessary for their qualified representatives to hold talks, after the relevant preparations have been completed, to study forms of further mutually beneficial economic and technical cooperation and to conclude corresponding agreements.

    It has now been agreed that the issues to be discussed by the aforementioned representatives are: matters relating to cooperation in developing agriculture, constructing power stations, water conservancy projects and automobile repair plants in Afghanistan, and renovating the Kabul airport.

    The Soviet government declared its agreement in principle to provide Afghanistan with technical assistance and financial assistance in the form of loans in implementing mutually agreed work plans for developing the Afghan economy in the above-mentioned areas.

    The amount of the loan provided by the Soviet Union in this regard is set at one hundred million US dollars; the loan will be long-term.

    The terms of the loan will be agreed upon by both parties in subsequent negotiations.

    The Afghan government expressed its deep gratitude to the Soviet government for agreeing to provide assistance to Afghanistan.
