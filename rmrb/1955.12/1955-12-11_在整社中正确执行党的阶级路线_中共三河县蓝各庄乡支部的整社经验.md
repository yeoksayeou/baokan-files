    Correctly Implement the Party's Class Line in Rectification of Cooperatives
    —The Experience of the Langezhuang Township Branch of the CCP in Sanhe County in Rectifying Cooperatives
    Li Jun, Liu Qi
    This autumn, three new agricultural cooperatives were established in Langezhuang Township, Sanhe County, Hebei Province. During the establishment process, because the township branch did not adhere well to the Party's class line and failed to adequately educate Party members on the class line, the leading cadres of the three new cooperatives were mostly well-to-do middle peasants. For example, in the Great Leap Cooperative, six out of eleven preparatory committee members were well-to-do middle peasants, three were lower-middle peasants, and two were poor peasants. In the other two cooperatives, well-to-do middle peasants also became the directors of the preparatory committees. After the well-to-do middle peasants gained leadership, they excluded the poor peasants. In the assessment of the value of means of production, all three new cooperatives in the township undervalued the land yields of the poor and lower-middle peasants. In production, the Great Leap Cooperative deliberately raised the price of manure, exceeding the market price by seven jiao to one yuan, causing significant losses to the poor peasants. The Jianping Cooperative stipulated that the use of members' livestock would be recorded in work points based on the number of days, and dividends would be distributed after the autumn harvest in the same way as labor. A male laborer earned five to eight work points per day, while a donkey earned four to seven work points per day. This resulted in higher income for wealthy households with livestock, while poor and lower-middle peasant members without livestock earned less.
    In mid-November, the Langezhuang Township Branch of the CCP began to address this issue and assist the cooperatives in their rectification work. To rectify the cooperatives, the first step was to unify thinking within the Party. At the beginning of the rectification, some Party members had a vague understanding of why it was necessary to rely on the poor peasants and unite with the middle peasants, and how to do so. Some individual Party members even believed that "poor peasants are uneducated, lack production and management experience, and do not have complete livestock and farm implements, so relying on them will hinder production." Therefore, they advocated relying on the middle peasants to run the cooperatives. In order to correct these vague understandings, the branch led all Party members in repeatedly studying Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," with particular emphasis on the document's section on the composition of cooperative members. The township branch also convened a meeting of Party members, at which it cited the different attitudes of poor peasants and well-to-do middle peasants towards the cooperatives. For example, when sowing wheat in the Friendship Cooperative, there was a shortage of livestock and the work could not be completed in time. Poor peasant members Zhou Guoxing and others voluntarily used wheelbarrows to transport manure to the fields. In eight days, they transported more than 1,500 wheelbarrows of manure, ensuring that the cooperative sowed wheat in time. However, none of the well-to-do middle peasant members went to transport manure. In the Jianhua Cooperative (an old cooperative), poor peasant member Ma Ruilin carried a manure basket when going to the fields, and picked up manure dropped by livestock along the way. Over the year, he collected more than two cartloads of manure for the cooperative. However, Zhao Wenrui, a well-to-do middle peasant member who often worked in the fields with him, never carried a manure basket or picked up manure. Both poor peasants and well-to-do middle peasants are members of the cooperative, so why are their attitudes towards the cooperative different? After discussion, the understanding of the Party members was raised. Li Qingcheng, a member of the Langezhuang Village Branch Committee, said, "Poor and lower-middle peasants have difficulties in production and life and need to be organized the most, so after joining the cooperative, they treat it as their home and are active in production." Cai Defu, deputy secretary of the Weigezhuang Village Branch, said, "Well-to-do middle peasants generally have more complete livestock and farm implements and more land, so when they first join the cooperative, they are always calculating in their hearts, afraid of suffering losses, and are prone to wavering." Everyone realized that it was necessary to rely on the poor peasants to run the cooperative well.
    However, some Party members therefore held a discriminatory attitude towards well-to-do middle peasants, believing that it was now possible to talk less or not at all about unity with well-to-do middle peasants, and to talk less or not at all about the policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. Some even regarded well-to-do middle peasants as the same as landlords and rich peasants, which was of course also wrong. After discovering these ideas, the township branch repeatedly explained the importance of uniting with the middle peasants to the Party members, explaining that both the middle peasants and the poor peasants were liberated under the leadership of the Party, and that their fundamental interests were consistent. The hesitation of the middle peasants on the issue of cooperation was mainly because they lacked sufficient understanding of socialism and needed to observe for another year or two. However, as long as we conscientiously implement the policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit and run the existing cooperatives well, the well-to-do middle peasants will voluntarily join the cooperatives. The meeting also used the facts of increased production achieved through the unity of poor and middle peasants in the local old cooperatives to educate the Party members.
    After the Party members clarified who to rely on and who to unite with to run the cooperatives well, the branch then convened a meeting of cooperative members in each cooperative, starting with unity work and educating the members on the mutual unity and production of middle peasants and poor peasants. At the meeting, the experience of the Jianhua Cooperative in Langezhuang in relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants to achieve increased production was summarized. The education through vivid facts was very effective, and the members realized that only by uniting poor peasants and middle peasants to improve production could they live a prosperous life; the idea of middle peasants thinking that poor peasants were taking advantage of them was initially resolved. Many middle peasant members said, "Everyone has benefited from being organized." Then, the branch guided the members to recall the oppression suffered by poor peasants and middle peasants in the old society and the pain brought to the peasants by class differentiation in the township after liberation. Facts proved that in recent years, not only have some poor and lower-middle peasants sold large amounts of land due to natural disasters and diseases, but some upper-middle peasants have also sold land due to natural disasters and diseases, and their lives have become difficult from being prosperous. For example, upper-middle peasant Yang Shiping had 20 mu of land, but sold 5.4 mu of land due to natural disasters and diseases, and his life gradually declined. Through recollection, the members realized that the small-peasant economy was unstable, and that not only poor peasants and lower-middle peasants needed to be organized, but upper-middle peasants also needed to be organized.
    After raising the socialist consciousness of the members, the Party members assisted the cadres of each cooperative in checking various unreasonable situations within the cooperative that caused losses to the poor peasants. First, the branch mobilized the members to reasonably adjust the manure price, ensuring that neither middle peasants nor poor peasants suffered losses, thereby increasing the members' enthusiasm for accumulating manure. The branch also solved the problem of livestock work point calculation. After democratic discussion among the members, everyone unanimously agreed that the previous work points for the use of members' livestock should be converted into prices and recorded in the accounts. A large donkey or cow would receive 7 jiao per day, a medium donkey or cow would receive 6 jiao per day, and a small donkey would receive 5 jiao per day. In the future, the cooperative would use members' livestock through private employment, and the cooperative and the members would sign a contract. The livestock labor price would be deducted from the total agricultural income after the autumn harvest. In this way, both poor peasants and middle peasants were satisfied. The branch also reversed the tendency to undervalue the land grades of poor peasants during the assessment of yields. The land yields of each household were re-examined, and it was stipulated that for poor peasants' land of the same quality, but with lower yields due to less processing and fertilization, and with yields that could be increased after joining the cooperative, the original yields should still be assessed, and the difference would be supplemented by the members with fertilizer. After such review and evaluation, the yields of 31.9 mu of land belonging to 15 poor and lower-middle peasant households in the three new cooperatives were reasonably adjusted. After eliminating the above unreasonable phenomena, the socialist enthusiasm of the poor peasants was further enhanced.
    The township branch cultivated a group of poor and lower-middle peasant backbone members in advance, and then initiated the re-election of cooperative cadres among the members. Through elections, those incompetent leading cadres composed of well-to-do middle peasants were replaced, and poor and lower-middle peasant backbone members with prestige among the masses were elected as cooperative cadres. For example, Wang Wenhua, the director of the Jianping Cooperative, was selfish and self-interested. When the cooperative was sowing wheat and did not have a plow, he had a plow but did not lend it. The cooperative stipulated that members should not retain private plots except for a portion of garden land, but he and his brothers Wang Wenzhong and Wang Wencheng retained eight mu of good land. The idea of calculating livestock labor points by the day was proposed by Wang Wenhua. However, poor peasants Ma Maotian, Li Shuming, and Xiong Yuxian (female) were fair and selfless, enthusiastic about running the cooperative, and were supported by the members. In the re-election, Ma Maotian, Li Shuming, and Xiong Yuxian were elected as the director and deputy directors, and Wang Wenhua was not elected. Li Futang, the deputy director of the Friendship Cooperative, who was also a well-to-do middle peasant, was also selfish and self-interested, and the members had many complaints about him. At this time, the township branch actively cultivated poor peasant Yang Yunyi as a backbone member. Yang Yunyi had worked as a laborer for more than 20 years, was allocated land during land reform, and is now actively running the cooperative. Later, during the election, Yang Yunyi was elected as deputy director, and Li Futang was not elected. Under the cultivation of the township branch, the eight directors and deputy directors of the three new cooperatives in the township are now all poor and lower-middle peasants.
    In the process of rectifying the cooperatives, the township branch paid attention to uniting with the middle peasants. Each cooperative elected a portion of well-to-do middle peasants as representatives to the members' representative conference. The cooperative also invited middle peasant representatives to attend various meetings. Correct opinions were adopted, and incorrect opinions were patiently explained. In addition, the township branch also regularly educated middle peasant members on the prospects of socialism and collectivism, helping them to overcome their shortcomings and establish collectivist ideology. In this way, the middle peasants' fear of suffering losses was quickly resolved, and they were able to concentrate on production.
    In order to better consolidate the unity of poor peasants and middle peasants in production, the township branch also helped the Jianhua Cooperative to conduct evaluations and selected 36 model members, of whom 32 were poor peasants and 4 were middle peasants. A conference was held to commend these model members. Other old and new cooperatives also commended the model deeds of poor and lower-middle peasants in loving the cooperative. The actions of poor and lower-middle peasants in protecting collective interests and actively working were very educational for the middle peasants. Many middle peasants said, "We must learn from the poor peasants, actively participate in labor, cherish the property of the cooperative, and strive to be model members."
    Because the Langezhuang Township Branch conscientiously implemented the class policy and strengthened the unity and education of poor peasants and middle peasants, new scenes of unity and production have emerged in all four old cooperatives and three new cooperatives in the township.

    在整社中正确执行党的阶级路线
    ——中共三河县蓝各庄乡支部的整社经验
    力军  刘琪
    河北省三河县蓝各庄乡今年秋天建立了三个新社。在建社中，由于乡支部没有很好地坚持党的阶级路线和在党员中进行阶级路线的教育，因此，三个新社的领导干部绝大部分是富裕中农，如伟大社十一个筹备委员中，就有六个是富裕中农，三个下中农，两个贫农；其他两个社也都是富裕中农当了筹备委员会主任。富裕中农取得领导权后，就排斥贫农，在评定生产资料中，全乡三个新社都压低了贫农和下中农的土地产量。在生产中，伟大社故意把粪肥价格提高，超过市价七角到一元，使贫农吃亏很大。建平社规定使用社员牲口按天记分，秋后和劳动力一样分红。一个男劳动力一天记五分到八分工，一头驴一天也记四分到七分工。这样有驴的富裕户收入就多，没有牲口的贫农和下中农社员收入就少。
    十一月中旬，中共蓝各庄乡支部着手来解决这个问题，协助各社进行整顿工作。要整社，首先要把党内的思想统一起来。整社开始，有的党员对为什么要依靠贫农，团结中农，怎样依靠贫农，团结中农等问题认识很模糊，甚至有个别党员认为“贫农没有文化，生产管理经验也不多，牲口、农具不齐全，依靠他们生产就搞不好。”因此，主张依靠中农办社。为了纠正这些模糊认识，支部领导全体党员反复地学习了毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的指示，特别着重学习了文件中关于社员成分的问题。乡支部又召开了党员会议，在会上举出了各社贫农和富裕中农对社的不同态度。如友联社在种麦的时候，因牲口少忙不过来，贫农社员周国兴等九人，就自动用小推车往地里推粪，八天就推出一千五百多小车粪，保证社及时种上麦子，可是富裕中农社员谁也不去推粪。建华社（老社）贫农社员马瑞林，在下地时背着粪筐，半路上看见牲口拉下的粪就拾起来，一年来共给社拾了两车多粪。可是同他经常在一起下地干活的富裕中农社员赵文瑞，向来不背粪筐，不拾粪。贫农和富裕中农都是社员，为什么对社的态度不一样呢？经过讨论，党员的认识提高了。蓝各庄村支部委员李庆成说：“贫农和下中农生产和生活都有困难，最需要组织起来，所以他们入社后就以社为家，生产积极。”魏各庄村支部副书记蔡德富说：“富裕中农一般是牲口农具比较齐全，土地比较多，所以在刚入社的时候心里老是打算盘，恐怕吃亏，容易动摇不定。”大家都认识到必须依靠贫农，才能把社办好。
    但是有的党员因此对富裕中农抱着歧视态度，认为现在可以对富裕中农少讲和不讲团结，少讲或不讲自愿互利政策；还有的把富裕中农同地主、富农一样看待，这当然也是错误的。乡支部发现这些思想后，又反复向党员讲解了团结中农的重要意义，说明中农和贫农都是在党的领导下得到解放的，他们的根本利益是一致的。中农在合作化问题上犹豫不定，主要是因为他们对社会主义认识不足，还要多看一两年，但只要我们认真贯彻执行自愿互利政策，办好现有的合作社，富裕中农是会自愿入社的。会上还用本乡老社贫农和中农团结得到增产的事实来教育党员。
    党员明确了应依靠谁团结谁来办好社的问题以后，支部接着就以社为单位召开了社员大会，先从团结工作做起，对社员进行中农和贫农相互团结生产的教育。会上总结了蓝各庄建华社依靠贫农和团结中农获得增产的经验。经过活生生的事实教育，收效很大，社员们都认识到只有贫农和中农团结起来搞好生产，才能过上富裕的生活；中农认为贫农沾自己的光的思想初步解决了。很多中农社员说：
  “大家沾了组织起来的光。”接着支部又引导社员回忆了旧社会贫农、中农受压迫和解放后本乡阶级分化给农民带来的痛苦的情况。事实证明，几年来不光有些贫农和下中农因天灾病害大批出卖土地，有些上中农也因天灾病害出卖土地，生活由富裕变成困难。如上中农杨士平有二十亩地，就因为天灾病害卖了五亩四分地，生活逐渐下降。通过回忆，社员认识到小农经济是不稳定的，不光贫农和下中农需要组织起来，上中农也需要组织起来。
    在提高社员的社会主义觉悟以后，党员就分头协助各社干部检查了社内各种使贫农吃亏的不合理的情况。首先支部动员社员合理地调整了粪价，做到中农、贫农都不吃亏，因而提高了社员积肥情绪。支部又解决了牲口记分的问题。经过社员民主讨论，大家一致同意以前使用社员的牲口工，一律折价记账，大驴和大牛每天给七角工价，中等驴和中等牛每天给六角工价，小驴每天给五角工价。今后社使用社员的牲口采取私有雇用的办法，社和社员订立了合同，牲口工价在秋后由农业总收入中扣除。这样做，贫农和中农都很满意。支部又扭转了评产中对贫农土地压级的偏向。对各户土地产量重新进行审查，规定贫农土地凡是质量相同，只是因加工施肥少产量较低，而入社后产量又能提高的土地，仍要按原来产量评定，相差的部分由社员补肥。经过这样审查评议，三个新社共有十五户贫农和下中农的三十一亩九分地，合理地调整了产量。消除了以上各种不合理现象以后，贫农的社会主义积极性更加提高了。
    乡支部事先培养了一批贫农和下中农骨干，接着就在社员中酝酿改选社干部。通过选举，撤换了那些不称职的富裕中农成分的领导干部，选举了在群众中有威信的贫农和下中农骨干当社干部。如建平社主任富裕中农王文华自私自利，社里种麦没有犁，他有犁也不借，社里规定社员除留一部分园田外，不留自留地，他和他弟弟王文仲、王文成却留了八亩好地，牲口按天记分就是王文华提出的。而贫农马茂田、李树铭、熊玉仙（女）公正无私，热心办社，受到社员拥护。在改选中，马茂田、李树铭、熊玉仙被选为正副主任，王文华落了选。友联社副主任富裕中农李福堂也是自私自利，社员对他的意见很多。这时乡支部就积极培养贫农杨允义当骨干。杨允义扛了二十多年活，土地改革分得了土地，现在积极办社。后来选举的时候，杨允义就被选为副主任，李福堂落选了。在乡支部的培养下，现在全乡三个新社的八名正、副主任都是贫农和下中农。
    在整社过程中，乡支部注意团结中农。各社都选举了一部分富裕中农当社员代表会的代表。社里召开各种会议，也都请中农代表参加，对他们的正确的意见就采纳，不正确的意见则耐心地进行解释。另外乡支部还经常对中农社员进行社会前途教育和集体主义教育，帮助他们克服缺点，树立集体主义思想。这样，中农怕吃亏的思想很快解除了，都能安心进行生产。
    乡支部为了更好地在生产中巩固贫农和中农的团结，还帮助建华社进行了评比，选出了三十六名模范社员，其中有三十二名是贫农，四名中农。对这些模范社员，召开大会予以表扬。其他老社和新社对贫农和下中农的爱社的模范事迹也进行了表扬。贫农和下中农爱护集体利益和积极劳动的行动，对中农教育很大。很多中农说：“咱们一定向贫农学习，积极参加劳动，爱护社里财产，争取当模范。”
    蓝各庄乡支部由于认真贯彻执行了阶级政策，加强了贫农和中农的团结教育，全乡四个老社和三个新社都出现了团结生产的新气象。
