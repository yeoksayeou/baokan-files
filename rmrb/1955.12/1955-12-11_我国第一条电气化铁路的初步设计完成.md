    Preliminary Design Completed for China's First Electrified Railway
    The preliminary design of the Baoji-Fengxian section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway—China's first railway to run electric trains—has been completed. At present, the designers of the Northwest Design Branch of the Ministry of Railways, who are responsible for the design work, are collecting various technical design materials, preparing to complete all the designs required for construction before August next year. The route from Baoji to Fengxian passes through the Qinling Mountains, which are more than 1,400 meters above sea level. If ordinary steam locomotives are still used for transportation on the railway built on the high and steep Qinling Mountains, efficiency will be limited. Using electric trains not only provides greater traction and higher speeds, but also reduces transportation costs compared to burning coal. Designing an electrified railway is a new technical endeavor for Chinese designers. Before starting the preliminary design, they visited small-scale electrified railway projects in the Fuxin and Fushun mining areas, learned advanced experience from Soviet designs, and received direct assistance from Soviet experts.

    我国第一条电气化铁路的初步设计完成
    中国第一条行驶电气火车的铁路——宝成铁路宝（鸡）凤（县）段的初步设计已经完成。现在，担任设计工作的铁道部西北设计分局的设计人员，正在收集技术设计的各项资料，准备在明年八月以前完成施工所需的全部设计。从宝鸡到凤县要穿过拔海一千四百多公尺的秦岭，在山高路陡的秦岭上修筑的铁路，如果还用普通蒸汽机车来运输，效率就要受到限制。用电气火车不但牵引力大，速度高，比烧煤还能降低运输成本。设计电气化铁路，是中国设计人员在技术上的新尝试。他们在开始进行初步设计以前，参观了阜新和抚顺煤矿区的小型电气化铁路工程，学习了苏联设计的先进经验，并且得到了苏联专家的直接帮助。　（新华社）
