Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 20th: People from all walks of life in Hanoi held a grand gathering on the evening of the 19th to commemorate the ninth anniversary of the National Resistance Day of Vietnam and the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam People's Army.

    The conference was convened and presided over by the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front. Attending the conference were Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Deputy Prime Ministers Phan Ke Toai and General Vo Nguyen Giap, and General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party Truong Chinh, among others.

    General Vo Nguyen Giap spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the Vietnamese people had achieved victory in the war of resistance, but the task of the Vietnamese people's national liberation struggle had not been completed. Therefore, the general task of the Vietnamese people in the coming period is to unite all the people more extensively on the basis of the program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, to guard against and overcome all conspiracies to sabotage the armistice agreement, and to strive for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords, the convening of consultative conferences, and the holding of free general elections; it is necessary to work hard to consolidate the North, complete land reform, and strive for the realization of the 1956 economic recovery plan.

    Vo Nguyen Giap emphasized that at present, U.S. imperialism is helping the Ngo Dinh Diem regime expand its military forces and transport military equipment into South Vietnam in an attempt to turn South Vietnam into a U.S. colony and military base. He said that the enemy would spare no effort to undermine the cause of the Vietnamese people in consolidating peace and realizing unification. However, today, we have more favorable conditions at home and abroad than ever before, and the struggle of all our people for consolidating peace, realizing unification, and completing independence and democracy will surely be victorious.

    Representatives of heroic units of the People's Army, representatives of workers in Hanoi, and people from South Vietnam also spoke at the meeting.

    Finally, the conference unanimously adopted telegrams of respect to President Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as to all personnel of the Vietnam People's Army.

    河内各界集会纪念越南抗战日和建军节
    据新华社河内二十日电　河内各界人民在十九日晚举行盛大集会，纪念越南全国抗战九周年和越南人民军建军十一周年。
    大会由越南祖国战线中央委员会召开和主持。参加大会的有越南民主共和国总理范文同，副总理潘继遂、武元甲大将，越南劳动党总书记长征等人。
    武元甲大将在会上讲了话。他指出，越南人民取得了抗战的胜利，但是越南人民的民族解放斗争任务并没有完成。因此，越南人民在今后时期中的总任务是：在越南祖国战线纲领的基础上更广泛地团结全体人民，提防和战胜一切破坏停战协定的阴谋，为彻底履行日内瓦协定、召开协商会议、举行自由普选而斗争；要努力巩固北方，完成土地改革，为一九五六年经济恢复计划的实现而奋斗。
    武元甲着重指出，目前，美帝国主义正帮助吴庭艳政权扩充军事力量和把军事装备运入南越，企图变南越为美国的殖民地和军事基地。他说，敌人是会不惜任何手段来破坏越南人民巩固和平、实现统一的事业的。但是，今天，在国内外我们具备着比以往更多的有利条件，我国全体人民为巩固和平、实现统一、完成独立和民主的斗争必定会取得胜利。
    在大会上讲话的还有人民军的英雄部队的代表、河内市工人代表和越南南方人士等。
    最后，大会一致通过致胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府以及致越南人民军全体人员的致敬电。
