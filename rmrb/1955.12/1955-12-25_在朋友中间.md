    Among Friends
    Meritorious Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic,
    Violetta Bovt
    It's both easy and difficult to talk about everything I saw in China. It's easy because these impressions are particularly fresh in my mind; it's difficult because it's no easy task to write about so many impressions, so many wonderful and interesting things I saw and learned, in a short newspaper article.
    When I learned that I was going to travel to China, I was very happy and excited. Yes, this is very natural. Here, you can't find anyone who doesn't know about the heroic struggle of the Chinese people for their happiness, or who isn't interested in the current situation of the Chinese people. How could I not be happy to have the opportunity to get acquainted with the brave and hardworking Chinese people, to understand their life, their outstanding art, and their thousands of years of civilization!
    On the other hand, I also had to participate in our theater's performances. Our theater should enable Chinese friends to understand the achievements of Soviet art. We have long known that drama has a long history in China. The people not only love it, but also value it. Whether we can be understood by Chinese audiences, whether we can inspire them, and finally, whether we can make them well aware of the value of Russian classical opera and ballet and understand modern Soviet drama?
    …We finally embarked on the journey. It took many days on the way. In order to be able to perform as soon as we arrived in Beijing, we decided to rehearse in the aisle of the carriage every day.
    I had never taken such a long train ride before. Moscow is thousands of kilometers away from Beijing. Endless fields, ancient forests, and towering mountains flashed past the windows of the carriage. The train passed through the tunnel of the gray-white Lake Baikal, crossed the border, and finally stopped at the platform of Beijing Railway Station. A sea of people and a sea of flowers surged towards us like a tide. Dazzling smiles, warm welcomes, and firm handshakes of friendship—these people are our friends, we will get to know them directly, and we will work with them.
    All of us knew very clearly that the people of our two countries have been friendly since ancient times, and the Soviets are well taken care of in New China. But only after stepping on Chinese soil did we truly understand and realize what this meant! We personally felt this love. Without a doubt, this is the most vivid and moving impression of a lifetime. The actual situation far exceeded everything we expected. We felt that we were among sincere friends, among friends who cared deeply for us.
    Every day spent in Beijing brought us some new, pleasant, and interesting things. While still in Moscow, we heard that Chinese comrades had specially renovated a theater for us where we would perform. On the first night, we went to see the theater. We visited the well-equipped stage, the convenient dressing rooms, and the excellent ballet rehearsal hall. All of us deeply thanked the Chinese workers and engineers for putting in so much effort to enable us to work in good conditions.
    Seeing that the Chinese comrades were working so hard to prepare everything for our performance as soon as possible, and were so eagerly looking forward to the performance, we decided to perform ahead of schedule.
    The day of my first performance arrived. The attentive audience encouraged me, I felt closely and creatively connected with the audience, and I wanted to dance better than ever.
    Particularly unforgettable was the evening I had the honor of participating in the performance of "Notre Dame de Paris," when the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, attended the performance.
    We had very little free time. Thanks to the care of the Chinese comrades, we had the opportunity to visit Beijing's famous palaces and parks and appreciate the art of the Chinese people. We also watched modern and classical dramas, and also watched the performances of several famous actors.
    First of all, I would like to talk about the strong and moving impression left in my mind after watching the play "Liu Hulan," the glorious daughter of the Chinese people. Through the great deeds of this ordinary girl, I particularly clearly realized the spiritual strength of the entire Chinese people and their indomitable will to advance to victory.
    The composer, director, and all the actors should be given due credit, because they created an excellent patriotic drama. The music is very infectious and expressive, and the director is so skillful. All of us very much liked everything about this kind opera, especially the talented actress Fang Xiaotian. I think her acting talent was most prominent in the two scenes of the trial and farewell to her mother. I don't understand Chinese, but I could not only understand the plot of the performance on stage very well, but also deeply appreciate all the emotions and feelings of Liu Hulan—Fang Xiaotian.
    We had the opportunity to watch classical plays. The superb acting skills of the actors made a strong impression on me. I particularly clearly remember the performances of the talented actors Du Jinfang, Zhang Yunxi, and Zhang Chunhua. Zhang Yunxi is truly an unparalleled actor, a master who can bring life back to the stage. He not only excellently masters the art of pantomime and coordinated movements, but also can express the thoughts and feelings of the characters he plays in an infectious way.
    Even before coming to China, I often heard people talk about Mei Lanfang and his superb skills. Like every comrade in our theater, I couldn't wait to get to know him and see his performing art, which is very natural.
    We finally saw him at a performance... Others told us that Mei Lanfang and his son would perform the classical play "The Legend of the White Snake" together. And when a young girl wearing plain clothes with a completely feminine posture appeared on the stage, it was simply difficult to believe that this role was played by a man. Mei Lanfang's skills have reached such a wonderful level that he not only vividly portrayed the appearance of this female character, but also fully revealed the emotions of this young girl. There is no more appropriate word than to call this a miracle.
    In short, the characteristics of Chinese drama are simplicity and naturalness, so the actors' movements are absolutely free and natural. They are vivid and lifelike on the stage. The actors' movements are very coordinated. They speak, sing, and make movements convincingly, which our teacher Stanislavsky believed was of great significance. The various inner changes from one emotion to another make each image vivid, bright, and unforgettable.
    The skills of Chinese drama artists are outstanding. They use very simple various art materials to create light, beautiful, and mainly supportive backdrops for the actors' performances. For example, in the play "Hunting the Tiger," the mountain scenery was created by the artist with only a few materials and a few light strokes, creating a complete impression of the distant view. Even I couldn't help but feel that I was entering the mountains and ridges with the performers. One cannot fail to mention the performance of the mass scenes. This kind of performance is simply unparalleled. In these scenes, the director's talent and the actors' high skills are combined seamlessly. The dazzling, fast, and complex movements leave an indelible impression. It is particularly noteworthy that these scenes, which are technically well-arranged and performed brilliantly, are not the goal itself, nor do they exceed the plot, but are an organic part of the drama.
    Visiting the Beijing Dance School left the most pleasant memories in my mind. Comrade Chen Jinqing introduced me in detail to the school's short, but also very illustrative of the characteristics of New China, history. This school was only recently established, and was established due to the People's Government's concern for the development of national culture and art.
    I had the opportunity to visit the school's classes, talk to the teachers, and understand their teaching methods. The training of the younger generation of dance artists is carried out by a number of capable people. The young teachers who have only recently completed their classical dance studies are very talented and enthusiastically pass on their knowledge to receptive students. At the same time, they still persistently carry out various studies and exchange experiences and knowledge with each other. All this makes it possible for them to teach at a very high professional level. There is no doubt that these teachers and students will achieve great creative achievements in the future.
    The following fact can prove the high level of accomplishment and talent of the school's students. In a very short period of time, they were able to prepare to participate in the performance of the Spanish and Hungarian dances in the ballet "Swan Lake," and "Swan Lake" is one of the most complex dance dramas in the classical repertoire. They worked very hard to complete all the instructions we gave during rehearsals, and stubbornly learned some new dance movements for them. And it is very pleasant to help such talented students. They gloriously withstood this arduous test and are fully qualified to participate in the performances of all ballet troupes.
    Unfortunately, due to the limited space of newspaper articles, I cannot talk in detail about the great help that many Chinese comrades gave us at any time in order to enable us to better prepare for the performance and rest well. Their care and attention deeply touched us. All this greatly promoted the success of our performance.
    Since returning to my country from China, I have often talked about my travels in the country of friends. Every time others ask me so many questions that the conversation always continues for a long time. I am very happy to talk about everything I have seen, because I know that they ask these questions not out of pointless curiosity, but because they want to know more about the lives and work of our Chinese friends who are marching shoulder to shoulder with us towards a bright future.
    Traveling in the land of friends has left an indelible mark on my life. The noble love and friendship that has always surrounded us in this beautiful country will always be remembered in my heart. I sincerely wish the outstanding performing artists of China, those comrades who have worked with us, and all the friends we know and do not know, new and greater creative achievements.

    在朋友中间
    俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会   
    主义共和国功勋演员    维奥列达·鲍夫特
    谈谈在中国所看到的一切是既容易又困难的。说它容易，是因为这些印象在头脑中特别新颖；说它困难，是因为要在一篇不长的报纸文章中，把所看到的和知道的这么多印象，这么多美好的、有趣的东西都写出来，实在不是一件轻而易举的事。
    当我知道要去中国旅行的时候，我感到非常高兴和激动。是的，这是十分自然的。我们这里，不知道中国人民为自己的幸福进行过英勇的斗争，对中国人民今天的情况不发生兴趣的人，是一个也找不到的。同勇敢勤劳的中国人民相识，了解他们的生活、他们的卓越的艺术和几千年来的文明，有这个机会，我怎能不高兴呢！
    另一方面，我也要参加我们剧院的演出，我们的剧院应当做到使中国朋友了解苏维埃艺术的成就。我们早已知道戏剧在中国有着悠久的历史，人民不但喜爱它，而且很重视它。我们是否能为中国的观众所理解，是否能激励他们，最后，是否能使他们很好地认识俄罗斯古典歌剧和芭蕾舞的价值、了解现代的苏维埃戏剧呢？
    ……我们终于踏上了旅途。在途中要走很多日子。我们为了一到北京马上就能演出，决定每天在车厢过道中进行排练。
    我以前从来没有坐过这样长途的火车。莫斯科离北京有几千公里。车厢的窗外闪过一望无际的田野、古老的森林、高耸的山峦。列车经过灰白色的贝加尔湖的隧道，越过国境，最后停到北京车站的月台旁。人海，花海，就像潮水般涌向我们。眩目的微笑，热烈的欢迎，紧紧的友谊的握手——这些人就是我们的朋友，我们将和他们直接相识，我们将和他们一道工作。
    我们所有的人都非常清楚地知道，我们两国人民自古以来就是友好的，苏联人在新中国受到很好的照顾。但是只有踏上中国的土地，我们才真正懂得和了解到这是什么！我们亲身感到了这种热爱。毫无疑问，这是一生中最鲜明、最动人的印象。实际情况远超过我们期待的一切。我们感到自己是在真挚的朋友中间，殷切关怀的朋友中间。
    在北京度过的每一个日子，都给我们带来某些新颖、愉快、有趣的事物。还在莫斯科的时候，我们就听说中国同志特别为我们改建了一座剧院，我们将在那里上演。就在第一天晚上，我们就去看了剧院。我们参观了设备完善的舞台、方便的化装室、极好的芭蕾舞排演大厅。我们全体深切地感谢中国的工人和工程师，为了使我们能在良好的条件下工作，他们花了这样多力量。
    看到中国同志们那么努力地给我们的演出尽快准备好一切，那么热烈地期待着上演，我们就决定提前上演。
    我第一次演出的日子来到了。聚精会神的观众鼓舞了我，我感到自己同观众紧密地创造性地联系在一起，我愿意比任何一次都舞得更好。
    特别难忘的是我有幸参加演出“巴黎圣母院”的那天晚上，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和人民政府的领导者出席观看了这次演出。
    我们空闲时间非常少，多亏中国同志们的关怀，我们才有机会游览了北京著名的宫殿和公园，欣赏了中国人民的艺术。我们也观看了现代戏剧和古典戏剧，还观赏了几位名演员的表演。
    首先我想谈谈在看了中国人民光荣的女儿“刘胡兰”这个戏以后留在我脑中的那种强烈的动人的印象。通过这位普通姑娘的伟大事迹，我特别清楚地了解到全中国人民的精神力量和向胜利前进的不屈不挠的意志。
    对于作曲家、导演以及全体演员应当给以应得的评价，因为他们创造了一个卓越的爱国主义的戏剧。音乐非常富于感染力和表现力，导演是那样巧妙。我们所有的人都非常喜欢这个亲切的歌剧院的一切，特别是天才的演员方晓天。我认为她的演戏天才在受审和辞别母亲那两场表现得最突出。我不懂中国话，但是我不但可以很好地了解舞台上表演的情节，而且可以深深地体会到刘胡兰——方晓天的全部情感和心情。
    我们有机会观赏了古典剧。演员的高深演技，使我产生了强烈的印象。特别清楚地记得杜近芳、张云溪、张春华这几位天才演员的表演。张云溪真是一个无与伦比的演员，是一个能使生活再现在舞台上的大师。他不仅卓越地掌握了哑剧和协调动作的艺术，而且能富于感染力地表达出自己所扮演的角色的思想和感情。
    还在到中国以前，我就常听人谈到梅兰芳，谈到他的绝技。我和我们戏院中每个同志一样，急不可待地想早点认识他，看看他的表演艺术，这是十分自然的。
    我们终于在一次表演会上看到了他……别人告诉我们说，梅兰芳和他的儿子将合演古典剧“白蛇传”。而当舞台上出现了一位完全是女人姿态的身着素服的年轻姑娘时，简直使人很难相信这个角色是由男人扮演的。梅兰芳的技巧已经达到了这样绝妙的境地，他不仅维妙维肖地刻划出了这个女角的外貌，而且完全揭示出了这个年轻姑娘的情感，除了把这说成是奇迹之外，再找不到更恰当的词儿了。
    总之，中国戏剧的特点是纯朴、自然，因而演员的动作绝对自如，他们在台上活灵活现。演员的动作非常协调。他们令人信服地说着、唱着、做着动作，我们的导师斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基曾认为这点有很大的意义。从一种情绪到另一种情绪的各种各样的内心变化，使各个形象都生动、鲜明和令人难忘。
    中国戏剧艺术家们的技巧是卓绝的，他们用非常简单的各种美术材料创造出轻便、优美、主要是衬托演员表演的布景。例如，“猎虎记”这出戏的山景，艺术家只是用很少的材料、淡淡的几笔就创造出了一幅印象完整的远景，连我也不由得感到自己和表演者一道进入了丛山峻岭之中。不能不谈谈群众场面的演出，这种表演简直是无与伦比的。在这些场面里，导演的才干和演员的高度技巧得心应手地结合在一起。令人眼花缭乱的、飞快的、复杂动作的奔流，给人留下了不可磨灭的印象。特别值得注意的是，这些在技术上编排得很出色，而演出技巧又很精采的场面并不是目的本身，也不逾越剧情，而是这个戏剧的有机的组成部分。
    访问北京舞蹈学校，在我头脑中留下了最愉快的记忆。陈锦清同志详细地给我介绍了这个学校的简短的、但也很可以说明新中国特征的历史。这个学校刚刚建立不久，是由于人民政府关怀民族文化和艺术的发展才建立起来的。
    我有机会参观了学校的上课情况，和教师们谈话，了解他们的教学法。青年一代舞蹈艺术家的培养由一些能干的人来进行的。不久以前才学完古典舞蹈的年轻教师们都很有才能，而且热情地把自己的知识传授给感受力敏锐的学员们。同时他们仍然坚持不渝地进行各种学习，互相交流经验和知识。这一切使他们有可能以很高的业务水平来教课，毫无疑问，这些教师和学员将来一定会获得巨大的创造性的成就。
    下面这个事实就可以证明学校学生们的高深素养和才赋。他们在很短的时间里，就能够准备参加演出芭蕾舞“天鹅湖”中的西班牙舞和匈牙利舞，而“天鹅湖”是古典剧中最复杂的舞剧之一。他们非常努力地完成了在排演时我们提出的一切指示，顽强地学会了对他们来讲是一些新的舞蹈动作。而帮助这样有天才的学生是十分愉快的事。他们光荣地经受住了这次艰苦的考验，已经完全有资格参加一切芭蕾舞剧团的演出。
    遗憾得很，由于报纸文章篇幅所限，使我不能详细谈谈许多中国同志为了使我们可以更好地准备演出和很好地休息，而随时给我们的巨大帮助。他们的关怀和照顾深深地感动了我们，所有这一切大大促进了我们演出的成就。
    从中国回到祖国以来，我经常谈到自己在朋友国家中的旅行。每次别人都给我提出那么多问题，以致谈话总是继续得很久，我非常高兴地谈到我所看到的一切，因为我知道决不是由于无谓的好奇心使他们提出这些问题，而是因为他们想更多地知道和我们肩并肩走向光明未来的中国朋友们生活和劳动的情形。
    在朋友的国度里的旅行，在我的生活中留下了不可磨灭的痕迹。在这个美好的国度里一直环绕着我们的那种崇高的爱和友情，将永远铭记在我的心中。我衷心地预祝中国的卓越的表演艺术家、那些曾同我们一道工作过的同志以及所有我们认识的和不认识的朋友们，取得新的、更大的创造性的成就。
