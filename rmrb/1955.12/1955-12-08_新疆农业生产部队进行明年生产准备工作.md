    Xinjiang Agricultural Production Corps is working intensely to prepare for next year's production. In order to produce more cotton and grain to support national industrial construction, the Xinjiang Production Corps has determined that the sowing area for 1956 will be more than 1,639,000 mu, an increase of 46% over 1955; the cotton sowing area will be more than doubled; and the yield per unit area of ​​major crops will be higher than in 1955. To ensure the realization of this plan, water conservancy troops are working hard on winter construction. The large and small water conservancy projects completed this year will increase the irrigation area by more than 570,000 mu, which is enough to guarantee farmland irrigation water for next year. After the autumn harvest, the reclamation area's agricultural troops vigorously carried out autumn plowing, winter irrigation, and fertilizer accumulation. By mid-November, the Manas River reclamation area had plowed more than 400,000 mu of land, accounting for more than 80% of the spring sowing area for next year. Other tasks such as seed preparation, maintenance and repair of agricultural machinery and tools are also being actively carried out. The reclamation area troops are also planning to set up various short-term training courses in tractors, agricultural technology, etc., to improve the troops' professional skills and management level. Some training courses have already started in early November.

    新疆农业生产部队进行明年生产准备工作
    新疆农业生产部队正紧张地进行明年生产的准备工作。新疆生产部队为了多生产棉粮支援国家工业建设，确定一九五六年的播种面积为一百六十三万九千余亩，比一九五五年扩大百分之四十六；棉花播种面积扩大一倍以上；主要作物的单位面积产量都比一九五五年有所提高。为了保证这一计划的实现，水利部队正紧张地进行冬季施工，今年内完成的大小水利工程，能增加灌溉面积五十七万多亩，足以保证明年农田灌溉用水。垦区农业部队在秋收结束后，大力进行秋耕冬灌和积肥等工作。玛纳斯河垦区到十一月中旬已经耕了四十多万亩地，占明年春播面积百分之八十以上。其他如种籽准备，机器农具保养检修等工作也正在积极进行。垦区部队还正在筹办拖拉机、农业技术等各种短期训练班，以提高部队的业务技术和经营管理水平。有的训练班已经在十一月初旬开学。
