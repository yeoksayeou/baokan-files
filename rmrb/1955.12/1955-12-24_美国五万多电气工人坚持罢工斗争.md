　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 22nd (via TASS) – According to newspaper reports: The strike of 55,000 workers at forty factories of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the United States has continued for two months. Because the local authorities' attempt to suppress the strike failed, the federal government agencies intervened in the strike.
　　The president of this union, FitzGerald, issued a statement on this matter saying: "We have fought and have crushed many similar attempts by the owners. The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America will certainly defeat this latest offensive."

    美国五万多电气工人坚持罢工斗争
    新华社据塔斯社纽约二十二日讯　据报纸消息：美国威斯汀豪斯电气公司四十个工厂的五万五千工人的罢工已经持续了两个月。由于地方当局镇压罢工的企图失败了，联邦政府机关就来干涉罢工。
    这一工会的主席费兹吉拉德为这件事发表声明说：“我们已经进行了斗争，已经粉碎了企业主的许多类似的企图，联合电气及无线电工人工会一定会击败最近这一次的进攻。”
