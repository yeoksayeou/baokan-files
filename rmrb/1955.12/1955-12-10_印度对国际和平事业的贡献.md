India's Contribution to the Cause of International Peace
Feng Zhidan

As early as eleven years ago, Prime Minister Nehru wrote in his book "The Discovery of India": "If India can show its influence, it will be a good thing for the world. Because this influence will be conducive to peace and cooperation, and not to aggression."

History has proved Prime Minister Nehru's assertion. Today, the young, independent Republic of India has emerged on the international stage as a factor for peace.

As an Asian country, India has expressed great concern for the peace and security of Asia. In 1953, India actively supported the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China to cease military action in Korea, and later served as Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. After the Korean armistice was achieved, India repeatedly advocated resolving the Korean issue by peaceful means.

In 1954, the Colombo Conference of the five South Asian countries, on India's initiative, adopted a resolution calling for the cessation of military action in Indochina and granting independence to the Indochinese countries. This resolution had a positive significance that could not be ignored for the Geneva Conference, which was then preparing to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina. After the Indochina armistice agreement was reached, India participated in the work of the International Supervisory and Control Commissions in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and served as chairman. By May of this year, the International Commission had completed the arduous task of assisting both sides in completing the military regroupment in Vietnam in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreement. At present, the Indian government has expressed its hope to continue to implement the Geneva Agreement and hold free general elections in Vietnam to consolidate peace in the Indochina region.

India is also very concerned about the tense situation in the Taiwan region caused by the United States' armed intervention. The Indian government fairly believes that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. The Indian representative to the United Nations has stated that the Indian government believes that "the disposition of the Taiwan issue should be based on the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations."

Related to this is the issue of restoring the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations. India has consistently and firmly supported the People's Republic of China's rightful status in the United Nations. Indian Prime Minister Nehru once said: "It is extremely bizarre for the United Nations to call the island of Taiwan China."

In June of last year, the Prime Ministers of China and India jointly advocated the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence as the basic norms for handling international relations. These five principles have been supported by many countries in Asia and Africa, and have also been formally endorsed by the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and other countries.

In April of this year, the Bandung Conference, attended by twenty-nine countries from Asia and Africa, was of great significance for easing international tensions. India was one of the initiators of the Bandung Conference and played a major role in its achievements.

India has repeatedly condemned aggressive blocs, actively advocated the establishment and expansion of peace zones, and in particular, resolutely refused to join the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, playing an important role in maintaining peace and security in Asia and the world. Prime Minister Nehru clearly pointed out: "The Southeast Asia Treaty is very unfortunate because it not only does not guarantee peace, but endangers peace."

In international affairs, India opposes the use of war and supports the use of peaceful consultation to resolve all international issues, actively advocates disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and demands that atomic energy be used for peaceful purposes.

India firmly opposes colonialism and supports the struggle of the people of many countries in Asia and Africa for national independence. At successive sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, India has always supported Indonesia's position in demanding the recovery of West Irian, opposed racial discrimination in South Africa, and opposed the armed suppression of the people of colonial dependencies by colonial countries. Colonial oppression is one of the factors causing international tensions, and India's efforts to oppose colonialism help to eliminate this factor and promote the development of international peace and cooperation. India, like many other Asian and African countries, also particularly emphasizes the importance of strengthening international economic cooperation. In recent years, India's trade volume with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies has been continuously increasing. India has successively signed trade agreements with the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, East Germany, and Bulgaria. India's trade ties with Asian and African countries are also continuing to expand.

The Indian government's peaceful diplomatic policy has greatly strengthened India's friendly and cooperative relations with many countries in the world. Although social systems and ideologies are different, this does not prevent the continuous enhancement of friendly and cooperative relations between India and China, and between India and the Soviet Union. India's relations with our country have always been friendly. Its friendly and cooperative relations with the Soviet Union have also greatly developed in recent years. In December 1953, the Soviet Union and India concluded a five-year trade agreement stipulating "the all-round development and strengthening of trade relations between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." In February of this year, the two countries signed another important agreement, according to which India will establish a huge metallurgical plant with an annual output of more than one million tons of steel with the full assistance of the Soviet Union. In June of this year, the joint statement issued in Moscow by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Prime Minister of India pointed out the importance of the two countries' efforts to develop and consolidate mutual economic, cultural, and technical cooperation. Now, the visit of the Soviet leaders to India marks a further development of the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India. Everyone can understand how great the significance is for the cause of international peace and cooperation when these three major countries in the world work together for peace.

Obviously, the Indian government's peaceful foreign policy is entirely in line with India's national interests. As is well known, British colonists ruled India for nearly two centuries, causing India's economic backwardness and stagnation, and bringing endless disasters to the Indian people. It was not until 1947, as a result of the Indian people's tenacious struggle, that India began to embark on the road of independent development. The establishment of the Republic of India in 1950 gave India the possibility of independent development. Therefore, in order to develop its own national economy and heal the wounds that colonialism brought to India, India urgently needs a peaceful environment. The Indian public is increasingly convinced that the development of international peace and friendly cooperative relations between countries is of great significance for India's independent development.

Due to India's contribution to the cause of peace and international cooperation in international affairs, India's international status has been continuously improved. India is playing an increasingly important role in international affairs today.

    印度对国际和平事业的贡献
    冯之丹
    早在十一年前，尼赫鲁总理在他的“印度的发现”一书中写道：“如果印度能够显示出它的影响，那末，这对世界来说，将是件好事情。因为这种影响将会有利于和平和合作，而不利于侵略。”
    历史证明了尼赫鲁总理的论断。今天，年轻的、独立的印度共和国，已经作为一个和平的因素，出现在国际舞台上了。
    作为亚洲国家之一的印度，对于亚洲的和平和安全表示了极大的关切。一九五三年，印度积极支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国关于停止朝鲜军事行动的建议，并在后来担任了中立国遣返委员会主席的职务。在朝鲜停战实现以后，印度屡次主张用和平方法解决朝鲜问题。
    一九五四年，南亚五国科伦坡会议根据印度的倡议，通过了要求停止印度支那军事行动并给予印度支那各国以独立的决议。这个决议，对当时准备讨论恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦会议具有不可忽视的积极意义。当印度支那停战协议达成以后，印度参加了在越南、老挝和柬埔寨的国际监察和监督委员会的工作，并担任主席的职务。到今年五月，国际委员会完成了一项艰巨的任务，即在越南按照日内瓦协议的规定协助双方完成了军事集结的工作。目前，印度政府表示希望继续贯彻日内瓦协议，在越南举行自由普选，以巩固印度支那地区的和平。
    印度也十分关心由于美国的武装干涉而引起的台湾地区的紧张局势。印度政府公正地认为，台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。在联合国内的印度代表曾经声明，印度政府认为“台湾问题的处置，应以开罗及波茨坦宣言为根据。”
    与此相关联的，是中华人民共和国在联合国代表权的恢复问题。印度一贯坚决地支持中华人民共和国应该在联合国取得合法地位。印度总理尼赫鲁曾说：“联合国把台湾岛屿称为中国，这是极其离奇的事情。”
    去年六月间，中、印两国总理共同倡议以互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处五项原则作为处理国际关系的基本准则。这五项原则已经得到了亚非地区许多国家的支持，也得到了苏联、南斯拉夫等其他国家的正式赞同。
    今年四月，有亚非洲二十九个国家参加的万隆会议，对于缓和国际紧张局势具有巨大的意义。印度是万隆会议的发起国之一，并且对于会议的成就起了很大的作用。
    印度一再地谴责侵略集团，积极倡议建立和扩大和平地区，特别是坚决拒绝参加东南亚侵略集团，对于维护亚洲和世界的和平安全起了重要的作用。尼赫鲁总理明确地指出：“东南亚条约是非常不幸的，因为它不但没有保障和平，反而危及了和平。”
    在国际事务中，印度反对以战争手段，而拥护以和平协商的办法来解决一切国际问题，积极主张裁减军备和禁止原子武器，并要求把原子能利用于和平的目的。
    印度坚决反对殖民主义，支持亚非许多国家人民争取民族独立的斗争。在各届联合国大会上，印度一向支持印度尼西亚要求收复西伊里安的立场，反对南非的种族歧视，反对殖民国家对殖民地附属国人民的武装镇压。殖民主义压迫是造成国际紧张局势的因素之一，印度反对殖民主义的努力，有助于消除这个因素，使国际和平合作事业得到发展。印度同其它许多亚非国家一样，还特别强调加强国际经济合作的重要性。近几年来，印度同苏联及人民民主国家的贸易额正在不断地增长。印度已先后同苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、民主德国、保加利亚签订了贸易协定。印度同亚非国家间的贸易联系也正在继续扩大中。
    印度政府奉行的和平的外交政策，使印度和世界上许多国家的友好合作关系得到了大大的加强。虽然社会制度和思想体系不同，但这并不妨碍印度和中国，印度和苏联之间的友好合作关系的不断增进。印度和我国的关系一直是友好的。它同苏联的友好合作关系近几年来也有了很大的发展。一九五三年十二月，苏印两国缔结了一项五年贸易协定，规定“在平等和互利的基础上，多方面发展和加强两国之间的贸易关系”。今年二月间，两国又签订了一项重要协定，根据这个协定，印度将在苏联的全面帮助下建立一个年产一百多万吨钢的巨大冶金工厂。今年六月，苏联部长会议主席和印度总理在莫斯科发表的联合声明中，指出了两国努力发展和巩固相互间的经济、文化和技术合作的重要性。现在，苏联领袖的访问印度，标志着苏印两国间的友好关系进一步发展。谁都能够理解，世界上这三个大国共同为和平而努力，对于国际和平和合作事业该有多么巨大的意义。
    显然，印度政府奉行要求和平的外交政策，是完全符合于印度的民族利益的。如所周知，英国殖民者统治印度将近两个世纪，造成了印度经济的落后和停滞，给印度人民带来了无穷的灾难。一直到一九四七年，由于印度人民顽强斗争的结果，印度才开始走上了独立发展的道路。一九五○年印度共和国的建立给了印度以独立发展的可能性。因此，印度为了发展自己的民族经济，医治好殖民主义带给印度的创伤，迫切需要一个和平的环境。印度公众越来越深信国际和平及各国间的友好合作关系的发展，对于印度的独立发展具有重大的意义。
    由于印度在国际事务中对于和平和国际合作事业的贡献，印度的国际地位也就得到了不断的提高。印度今天正在国际事务中发挥愈来愈重要的作用。
