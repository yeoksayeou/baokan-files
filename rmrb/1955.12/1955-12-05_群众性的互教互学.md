Mass Mutual Teaching and Learning

A large number of new cooperatives were established in Wu Zhi County, Henan Province around the autumn harvest this year. Due to the lack of practical experience in running cooperatives, many problems arose, such as production team leaders being unable to deploy labor and accountants making mistakes in bookkeeping. In order to cultivate and improve the working ability of the backbone members of the cooperatives and quickly help the newly established cooperatives establish a normal working order, the Wu Zhi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted the following leadership method: within the mutual aid and cooperation network, with the stronger backbone members of the old and new cooperatives as the center, the heads, accountants, production team leaders, custodians, feeders, technicians, etc. of each cooperative were organized to hold regular discussion meetings to exchange experiences and solve problems. These meetings are generally held at the township level, once every five to seven days. There are two ways to solve problems. One is to systematically impart the experience that the Party branch wants to promote; the other is for everyone to raise difficult questions, which are answered by experienced people.

After Wu Zhi County adopted this mass mutual teaching and learning method, it rapidly improved the working ability of the backbone members of the cooperatives. According to the statistics of eighty-three townships in the county, there emerged six hundred and one backbone members capable of helping others, and nine hundred and forty-five new backbone members were trained; more than seven hundred accountants learned how to establish accounts and record work. Now the Wu Zhi County Committee has decided to strengthen the leadership of this organizational form and make this work regular.

    群众性的互教互学
    河南省武陟县今年秋收前后建成的大批新社的领导骨干，由于缺乏办社的实际经验，发生了许多生产队长调不开劳力、会计记错账等等现象。中共武陟县委为了培养和提高社内骨干的工作能力，迅速帮助各新建社建立起正常的工作秩序，采取了这样一个领导方法：在互助合作网内，以老社和新社中较强的骨干为中心，把各社的社长、会计、生产队长、保管员、饲养员、技术员等组织起来，定期分别举行碰头会议，交流经验，解决问题。这种会议一般以乡为单位，五天到七天开一次。解决问题的方法有两种。一种是把党支部要推广的经验，有组织地进行传授；一种是大家提出疑难问题，由有经验的人解答。
    武陟县采用这种群众性的互教互学方法以后，迅速地提高了合作社内骨干的工作能力。根据这个县八十三个乡的统计，出现了有能力帮助别人的骨干六百零一人，培养出新的骨干九百四十五人；七百多个会计员学会了立账记工的办法。现在武陟县委已决定加强对这一组织形式的领导，使这一工作经常化。
