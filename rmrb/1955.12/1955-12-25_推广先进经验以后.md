After Promoting Advanced Experiences
　　Chen Xiangzhong

　　From January to July this year, the mechanical processing workshop of Shenyang Fan Factory did not complete its plan well. Production was slack at the beginning and tight at the end, often requiring overtime to catch up. This situation was especially serious after the addition of new product trial production tasks in the second quarter. In July, four indicators—labor productivity, total output value, product quality, and variety—were not completed, and the defect rate also exceeded the national regulations. If the processing workshop fails to complete the plan, the assembly workshop's production plan will naturally not be completed either.

　　Why was the production task not completed well? Some workshop leaders and workers believed that the main reason was that the task was too heavy and the quotas were set too high. Workshop Director He Shiyao, Deputy Director Li Honggong, and others repeatedly requested relevant departments and the factory director to lower the quotas and add some workers with higher technical skills.

　　Was the task too heavy? Did the workshop have no potential? No. At some relevant meetings, the factory's administrative leaders and the Party General Branch Committee had studied their problems. They believed that the task of this workshop was not heavy and the technical level was not low. The key issue was that they had not promoted various advanced experiences but only used overtime and rush work to complete the tasks. In recent years, the leading staff of this workshop had also called on workers to learn advanced experiences and had even held performance meetings of advanced working methods for this purpose. At that time, some workers did learn the lathe methods of Kolesov, Unonov, Chikiryov, and others. But now, besides the Kolesov tool, which has been used on four lathes, there is only one Kuzovkin cutting tool in the entire workshop. Based on this situation, the factory leaders decided not to reduce the workshop's tasks, nor to add workers and equipment, but to require them to systematically learn and promote the above-mentioned Soviet advanced experiences and tools to comprehensively complete the national production plan.

　　According to the instructions of the Party General Branch, the workshop Party branch convened a branch committee and a general meeting of Party members, criticizing some Party members' negative emotions towards completing the national plan and the erroneous view of opposing the promotion of advanced experiences to the completion of tasks. The erroneous thoughts of He Shiyao, Li Honggong, and others who were in charge of administrative leadership were also criticized. At this time, the workshop's administrative department also formulated a plan to promote seven types of tools according to the requirements of the factory, and strengthened the supply of tools and the management of the tool room. In addition, based on the situation where some workers believed that the equipment was old and the technical level was low and that these advanced tools could not be used, the workshop trade union organized technical performance meetings, held training courses, provided technical guidance to workers with low technical levels, and designated technicians to specifically help workers overcome technical difficulties. In this way, these advanced experiences and tools were quickly promoted in the workshop. From August to now, the entire workshop has applied seven advanced experiences and tools, such as the Kolesov tool, to 84% of various belt lathes, greatly improving production efficiency. In the past, lathe operators Tang Dejin and Wan Jingmao needed 140 hours to process wheel housings using belt lathes, but now it only takes 85 hours. Workers Liu Fengwu and Hou Yuli increased efficiency fivefold after using the Kuzovkin cutting tool. In October, there were many tasks for processing "bases" with large turret lathes, so the leaders transferred Party member Dai Hongkai to this lathe to rotate production in three shifts with two other workers, Tong Baoyu and Huang Renzhong. Dai Hongkai studied with technicians and Tong Baoyu, Huang Renzhong, and others, and also used the Kolesov tool. After four days of research, they were unsuccessful. Everyone was discouraged, but Dai Hongkai persisted. Finally, one night, he succeeded in the experiment. Processing a "base" according to the quota used to take 66 hours, but now it only takes 23 to 24 hours.

　　In the past, 30% of the workers in the workshop who were paid piece-rate wages could not reach the quota, but now they have all exceeded the quota. In the past, because the quota could not be completed, workers paid piece-rate wages in this workshop only accounted for 18% of the total number of workers. Now many workers are actively requesting to be paid piece-rate wages. In November, workers paid piece-rate wages reached more than 70% of the total number of workers, and their average income was 42 wage points higher than their basic wages. As long as advanced tools are used, the quota can be broken.

　　Due to the promotion of advanced tools, the production outlook of this workshop has greatly changed. Now, the phenomenon of slack at the beginning and tight at the end, and overtime work has disappeared, product quality has improved, and the defect rate has been reduced by two-thirds compared with the national plan. Due to the increase in productivity, 17 technicians were transferred from this workshop to work in other workshops in November and December. From August to November, they have been able to overfulfill the four indicators given by the state every month and can complete them by the number of units. Due to the improvement in the completion of the plan, in addition to making up for the plans that were not completed in six of the months from January to July, they also exceeded it by 2.57%. By the end of October, they had completed more than 80% of the first-time production increase and savings plan, and in November they added a production increase and savings plan of 37,000 yuan. Due to the good completion of the task in this workshop, the assembly workshop also eliminated the phenomenon of overtime work in September.

    推广先进经验以后
    陈祥忠
    沈阳扇风机厂机械加工车间，今年一到七月，计划完成得都不好，生产前松后紧，经常加班加点突击。这种情况，在第二季度增加了新产品试制的任务以后，尤其严重。七月份，劳动生产率、生产总值、产品质量、品种等四项指标都没有完成，废品率也超过了国家的规定。加工车间完不成计划，装配车间的生产计划当然也完不成。
    为什么生产任务完成得不好呢？有的车间领导工作人员和工人认为，主要的原因是任务太重，定额订高了。车间主任贺士尧、副主任李洪恭等，都不止一次地向有关科和厂长请求降低定额，增加一些技术较高的工人。
    任务重吗？车间没有潜力了吗？不是的。在一些有关的会议上，厂的行政领导和党总支委员会都曾研究过他们的问题。他们认为，这个车间的任务并不重，技术水平也不低。问题的关键是他们没有推广各种先进经验，而只是用加班加点突击的办法来完成任务。这几年，这个车间的领导工作人员也曾号召过工人们学习先进经验，并且曾为此举行过先进工作方法的表演会。当时，的确也有些工人学会了科列索夫、乌诺纳夫、奇基列夫等人的车刀法。可是现在，除了科列索夫一种车刀已经在四台机床上应用外，全车间只有一把库佐夫金切刀。根据这个情况，厂的领导上就决定不给车间削减任务，也不给车间增加工人和设备，而是要求他们有计划地学习和推广上述一些苏联先进经验和刀具，来全面完成国家的生产计划。
    按照党总支的指示，车间党支部召开了支部委员会和党员大会，批评了有些党员对完成国家计划的消极情绪和把推广先进经验同完成任务对立起来的错误看法。对担负行政领导工作的贺士尧、李洪恭等的错误思想，也给了批判。这时，车间的行政方面也根据厂部的要求，订出了推广七种刀具的计划，加强了刀具供应和刀具室的管理工作。此外，他们还根据某些工人认为设备老旧和技术水平低，不能用这些先进刀具的情况，由车间工会组织了技术表演会，举办训练班，对技术水平低的工人进行了技术辅导，并且指定技术员具体帮助工人克服技术上的困难。这样，这些先进经验和刀具就很快地在车间推广起来了。从八月份到现在，全车间在百分之八十四的各种皮带车床上运用了科列索夫车刀等七种先进经验和刀具，大大提高了生产效率。过去，车工唐德金、万景茂用皮带车床加工轮壳需要一百四十小时，现在只用八十五个小时就完成了。工人刘凤武、侯玉利运用了库佐夫金切刀后，效率提高了五倍。十月份，用大头镟床加工的“底座”任务很多，领导上就把党员代洪凯调到这台车床上和另外两个工人佟宝玉、黄仁忠三班轮流生产。代洪凯同技术员和佟宝玉、黄仁忠等人一块研究，也来使用科列索夫车刀。研究了四天，都没有成功。大家都泄气了，可是代洪凯还坚持着干。终于，在一天夜里，他试验成功了。加工一个“底座”，按照定额用六十六个小时，现在只用二十三、四个小时。
    过去，车间里占实行计件工资人数百分之三十的工人都达不到定额，现在都超过了定额。过去由于完不成定额，这个车间里实行计件工资的工人只占到总人数的百分之十八。现在许多工人都主动要求实行计件工资了。十一月份，实行计件工资的工人达到了总人数的百分之七十以上，他们的平均收入比基本工资高出四十二个工资分。只要是运用了先进刀具的，都能够突破定额了。
    由于推广先进刀具，这个车间的生产面貌大大改观。现在，生产上前松后紧、加班加点的现象没有了，产品质量提高了，废品率比国家计划降低了三分之二。由于生产率的提高，十一、十二两个月还从这个车间里抽走了十七名技术工人到别的车间去工作。从八月到十一月，他们已经能月月按照国家给的四项指标超额完成任务，并且可以按台份来完成。由于完成计划的情况好转，除了补上一至七月中有六个月未完成的计划以外，还超过了百分之二点五七。到十月末为止，他们完成了第一次制定的增产节约计划百分之八十以上，十一月他们又增订了三万七千元的增产节约计划。由于这个车间任务完成得好，装配车间九月份也消灭了加班加点现象。
