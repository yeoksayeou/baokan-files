Improving the organization of grain reception work during the autumn grain storage period, increasing the efficiency of grain collection, and ensuring the safety of people and animals are major issues.

Every year, when it's the season for farmers to sell grain, large numbers of grain carts line up in long queues at some local grain stations. The grain stations are noisy and chaotic, and accidents resulting in injuries and deaths often occur. Some farmers even queue from morning till night, only to find that their grain hasn't been weighed by the end of the day.

This year, the Shuangmiaozigrain purchasing and selling station in Changtu County, Liaoning Province, has earnestly resolved this problem. Based on the past lessons of slow weighing during grain collection, the staff of the purchasing and selling station developed the "Three-Vehicle Mutual Assistance Flow Weighing Method." This involves arranging the grain carts that are ready to be weighed into groups of three. The people on the second and third vehicles help the first vehicle to weigh and load grain, and then the first vehicle goes to the designated grain field to unload. At this point, the original second vehicle becomes the first, and the fourth becomes the third, forming another mutual assistance group... When there are fewer than three vehicles left, the weigher helps with loading and unloading. This ensures that the weighing is fast and the unloading is fast. Originally, it took three minutes to weigh each cart of grain, but now it only takes a little over a minute. At the same time, the mutual assistance in loading and unloading solves the difficulty for elderly farmers who cannot unload the grain themselves.

    改善收粮工作秩序
    在秋粮入库期间，把粮食接收工作组织好，提高收粮工作效率，保证人畜的安全，是一件大事情。
    每年一到农民卖粮的季节，有些地方的粮栈里就有大批的送粮大车排着很长的队，粮栈里人吵马叫，秩序很乱，常有伤亡事故发生。有的送粮农民甚至从早晨一直排到晚上，最后粮食还没有过秤。
    今年，辽宁省昌图县双庙子粮食购销站认真地解决了这个问题。购销站的工作人员根据往年收粮时过秤太慢的教训，研究出了“三车互助流水过秤法”，就是把准备过秤的粮车排起来，由第一辆到第三辆车是一个互助小组。第二、三辆车上的人帮助第一辆车过秤、装车，然后第一辆车就到指定的粮场去卸粮。这时原来的第二辆车就变成第一辆，第四辆变成第三辆又成了一个互助组……到最后不够三车的时候，由过秤员帮助装卸。这样就做到了上秤快，下秤快，原来每过秤一车粮食需三分钟，现在只需一分多钟。同时由于互助装卸，也解决了老年农民卸不动粮食的困难。
