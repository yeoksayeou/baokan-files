The Tianjin Maritime Court accepted the public prosecution brought by the Tianjin Maritime Transport Procuratorate and publicly tried the "Xihe" dredger sinking case on December 2. The criminals Wang Baofu, Li Ruiting, and Liu Xiaoxian were sentenced to four years, two years, and one year of imprisonment respectively, to be executed immediately, in accordance with the law.

The "Xihe" was a giant dredger belonging to the Tianjin Dredging Company's Dredging Team and had played a significant role in port construction dredging work. However, this state property was lost due to the irresponsibility and negligence of duty by Wang Baofu, the acting captain of the "Meiling" tugboat, navigator Li Ruiting, and Liu Xiaoxian, the temporary head of the Yantai work area, resulting in the sinking incident. In this incident, dozens of crew members on the "Xihe" nearly lost their lives.

The course of this case is as follows: On December 1, 1954, the Tianjin Dredging Team of the Dredging Company of the Navigation Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications notified the "Meiling" wheel, which was in Lüda, to sail to Yantai to tow the "Xihe" dredger, which was in Yantai, back to Tanggu, Tianjin for repairs. On the 4th, this matter was notified to Liu Xiaoxian, the temporary head of the Yantai work area, by long-distance telephone. However, Liu Xiaoxian did not prepare the "Xihe" for departure in accordance with the instructions of his superiors, and even failed to notify the "Xihe" crew that the "Xihe" was to be transferred back to Tianjin. On December 9, the "Meiling" wheel arrived in Yantai. But at this time, the "Xihe" crew was still working on the "Dagu No. 1," and because preparations for departure had not been made, they did not leave that night. In order to rush the task, Liu Xiaoxian even asked the "Xihe" crew to work as usual on the morning of the 10th until 10:00 AM when he transferred them back and notified them that the "Xihe" was to return to Tianjin immediately; and mobilized everyone to carry out departure preparations before departure.

On the morning of December 10, Jiao Guozhu, a supplier from the Yantai work area, asked Wang Baofu, "Do you need coal and water? If so, we can prepare." Wang Baofu said without thinking, "If we leave today, we don't need it." Later, they did not leave for some reason. Wang Baofu requested 20 tons of special grade coal from Liu Xiaoxian, but Liu Xiaoxian only agreed to give No. 1 coal, which caused a dispute between the two sides, resulting in a stalemate. In the last negotiation, Liu Xiaoxian avoided the debate over the coal issue and mobilized Wang Baofu to set sail quickly. Because Wang Baofu did not pay enough attention to loading enough spare coal to ensure navigation safety, he decided to set sail under Liu Xiaoxian's one-sided mobilization. However, at that time, many crew members pointed out that there was wind after the snow, and it would be dangerous if the coal was insufficient in the event of wind. Therefore, "No. 1 coal should also be loaded." But this opinion was not adopted by Wang Baofu, and he ventured to set sail. Before setting sail, although Wang Baofu also knew that Li Ruiting had said to the "Xihe" crew that they would abandon the ship halfway, and was opposed by the "Xihe" crew, he deceived the "Xihe" crew.

After the voyage began, around 17:00 on the 11th, the wind and waves gradually increased. The future wind conditions were unclear, and it was dangerous to continue sailing at this time. However, Wang Baofu and Li Ruiting did not consider it and continued to sail. Later, the wind and waves became stronger. Around 19:00, the ship was idling and the speed decreased. At this time, they still continued to venture forward. By 8:00 on the 12th, the "Meiling" wheel only had 17 or 18 tons of coal left. When the stoker reported to Li Ruiting and Wang Baofu again, they began to realize that it was impossible to reach Tanggu at the original speed, and they were about to implement the original plan to abandon the ship. While Wang Baofu and Li Ruiting were discussing, the "Democracy No. 8" wheel happened to come from the left rear of the "Meiling" wheel. This was the best opportunity to ask for help, but they did not actively try to ask for help. After the "Democracy No. 8" wheel passed, they believed that there was no other way to think about it except to abandon the "Xihe," so they hastily decided to anchor the "Xihe." What was particularly serious in this matter was that they should have convened experienced crew members of the "Meiling" wheel in advance to jointly study possible salvage methods. If it was absolutely necessary to implement ship abandonment measures, they should have contacted the "Xihe" crew in advance according to the prescribed signals. But they didn't do that. Wang Baofu even thought, "If we contact them according to the signal, what if they don't let us go?" Li Ruiting did not object either. When the anchor was dropped, the "Xihe" crew was shocked, questioned the reason, and shouted, "Don't go, our forward cabin is leaking! What will we do if you leave!" But Wang Baofu ignored these circumstances and sailed away alone.

After the "Meiling" wheel arrived in Tanggu, the dredging team leader He Yue questioned Wang Baofu about the reason for abandoning the ship and other circumstances. In order to evade responsibility, Wang Baofu said that the wind was strong and there was not enough coal, and that the "Xihe" was "anchored very long and firmly, no problem," concealing the water leakage of the "Xihe." When the leadership asked Wang Baofu to quickly add coal and go to rescue the "Xihe," Wang Baofu argued about the issue of special grade coal and No. 1 coal, delaying the time. Wang Baofu was very passive in rescuing the "Xihe," repeatedly requesting to return on the way, and finally even proposed to Jin Bu, the deputy captain of the dredging team leading the ship, "I have to go back if I'm told to go back, and I'll go back if I'm not told to go back." Then he turned the rudder and returned. During the rescue process, the "Xihe" encountered other passing ships, and the lives of the entire crew were saved, but the dredger finally sank because the rescue was too late!

After the incident, Wang Baofu knew that the responsibility was serious, and had concealed the truth for a long time, and tried to blame others. Wang Baofu told the "Meiling" wheel crew, "Don't say that the work area gave us coal and we didn't want it, just say that we wanted coal and the work area didn't give it." Wang Baofu and Li Ruiting even falsely claimed for a long time that they did not hear the "Xihe" crew shouting not to leave, but only saw the other crew members gesturing to hurry up. This shameful behavior of trying to evade guilt was only fully admitted after multi-party confrontation.

    天津水上法院审判“西河”号挖泥船沉没案件
    天津水上运输法院接受天津海上运输检察院提起的公诉，在十二月二日公开审判了“西河”号挖泥船沉没案件，依法判处犯罪分子王宝福徒刑四年、李瑞亭徒刑二年、刘孝先徒刑一年，立即执行。
    “西河”号是天津疏浚公司所属疏浚队的一艘巨型挖泥船，在建港疏浚工作中曾起过很大作用。但是国家的这项财产，却由于“没凌”号拖轮代理船长王宝福、领航员李瑞亭、烟台工区临时负责人刘孝先等人在工作中不负责任，玩忽职守，造成了沉没事件。在这一事件中，“西河”号上几十名船员险些丧命。
    这个案件的经过是这样的：一九五四年十二月一日，交通部航务工程总局疏浚公司天津区疏浚队通知正在旅大的“没凌”轮驶往烟台，把正在烟台的“西河”号挖泥船拖回天津塘沽修理；并且在四日用长途电话把这件事通知了烟台工区临时负责人刘孝先。但是刘孝先并没有按照上级的指示做好“西河”号出海的一切准备工作，甚至连“西河”号要调回天津的事也没有通知“西河”号船员。十二月九日，“没凌”轮到了烟台。但这时“西河”号船员仍在“大沽一号”工作，加上出海准备没有做好，当夜未走。刘孝先为了赶任务，甚至在十日早晨，仍叫“西河”号船员照常工作，直到上午十时才把他们调回来，通知“西河”号要马上回天津；并发动大家在临开船前进行出海准备工作。
    十二月十日早晨，烟台工区供应员焦国柱曾问王宝福：“要不要煤和水？如果要的话，我们好作准备。”王宝福不经考虑就说：“今天走就不要。”后来因故未走。王宝福向刘孝先要求上特号煤二十吨，而刘孝先只答应给一号煤，为此双方发生了争执，造成僵局。在最后一次谈判中，刘孝先避开上煤问题的争论，向王宝福作了迅速开航的动员。由于王宝福对于装足备煤以保证航行安全注意不够，在刘孝先片面动员下决定开航。但当时有不少船员提出雪后有风，遇风燃煤不足是有危险的，因此“一号煤也要上”。但这种意见并没被王宝福采纳，竟冒险开航。临起航之前，王宝福虽然也知道李瑞亭曾向“西河”号船员说在半途抛船，并遭到“西河”号船员的反对，但他却把“西河”号船员欺骗支吾过去。
    开航以后，十一日十七时左右，风浪逐渐增大。未来风势不明，这时坚持航行是危险的。但是王宝福、李瑞亭不加考虑，仍然航进。以后风浪更大，到十九时左右，船打空车，航速减低。这时他们仍然继续冒险航进。到十二日八时，“没凌”轮燃煤只剩下十七、八吨，司炉员再向李瑞亭和王宝福报告，这时他们才开始发觉按照原来速度驶行已经不可能到达塘沽了，就要实行原来的抛船计划。王宝福和李瑞亭正在议论的时候，“民主八号”轮船适从“没凌”轮左侧后方开来。本来这是求救的最好机会，但他们却没有积极设法求救。“民主八号”轮过后，他们认为除去抛掉“西河”号再没有其他办法可想了，就草率决定给“西河”号抛锚。在这件事情上表现得特别严重的是，他们在事先应该召集“没凌”轮有经验的船员共同研究可能的挽救办法，如果在万不得已的情况下必须实行抛船措施，更应该按照规定的信号事先同“西河”号船员联系。但他们没有这样做，王宝福甚至认为：“如果按信号联系，他们不叫咱们走怎么办？”李瑞亭也未加反对。当抛锚以后，“西河”号船员大惊，追问原因，并且跳着高呼：“你们别走，我们前舱漏水了！你们走了我们怎么办！”但是王宝福没有理会这些情况，单船开走了。
      “没凌”轮到达塘沽以后，疏浚队长何越追问王宝福抛船的原因和其他情况，王宝福为了逃避责任，说是风大煤不够了，“西河”号“锚下得很长很牢，没问题”，隐瞒了“西河”号漏水情况。当领导方面叫王宝福迅速加煤前去营救“西河”号的时候，王宝福又为上特号煤一号煤的问题发生争执，拖延时间。在营救“西河”号的时候，王宝福表现得很消极，在途中多次要求返航，最后甚至向领船的疏浚队副队长靳步提出：“叫回去也得回去，不叫回去我也回去。”随即转舵回航。在营救过程中，“西河”号遇到其他过航船只，全船船员生命得救，但是这只挖泥船，最后却因为营救太迟，终于沉没了！
    案件发生后，王宝福自知责任严重，曾长期掩盖真实情况，并且企图嫁祸于人。王宝福告诉“没凌”轮船员说：“不要说工区给煤我们不要，就说我们要煤工区不给。”王宝福和李瑞亭甚至长期诡称：没有听到“西河”号船员高呼不让走，只看见对方船员以手示意叫快走。这种企图逃避罪责的可耻行为，经多方对证以后他们才完全承认。
