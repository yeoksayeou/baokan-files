    Expanding the Area of Mechanical Snow Removal
    On snowy days, the streets of Moscow are often covered with thick snow. However, even before the snowflakes stop falling, the snow removal workers on each street are already out in force. The snow that has accumulated all night is completely cleared away in a short time in the early morning.
    Snow removal in Moscow is becoming increasingly mechanized. This year, the area of streets cleared by mechanical snow removal throughout the city will increase to 16.5 million square meters. Each district of Moscow has a total of 1,400 machines and mechanical devices for snow removal, including more than 500 snowplows and nearly 150 automatic snow loaders. New equipment has also been added this year. A special snowplow for relatively narrow one-way streets will appear here. A thousand gas snow melting devices will also be installed in residential courtyards to reduce the labor of cleaning personnel.
    Continuing to Green the Streets in Winter
    The work of cultivating trees and greening the streets in Moscow continues in winter. Many perennial trees are transported by trucks from the suburbs along many highways.
    Twelve thousand linden and maple trees have been transported from the Bronnitsky Forestry Farm in the suburbs of Moscow. These are not seedlings, but trees that have been growing for eighteen to twenty years. Using mature trees to green the streets can greatly reduce costs.
    Delivering Train Tickets to Passengers' Homes
    The practice of the Kursk Railway Station in Moscow of delivering train tickets to passengers' homes this year has been very popular. Passengers only need to make a phone call to the station's ticket office or mail a postcard, and the station will deliver the tickets to the passenger's residence as scheduled. In the first ten months of this year, the station delivered more than 280,000 tickets to passengers' homes.
    The station also implements a system for pre-ordering return tickets. These tickets have the return date, train number, and carriage number written on them, so there is no need to buy another ticket when returning to Moscow.
    Mobile Canteens
    A mobile canteen has appeared on the streets of Moscow. It is set up on a large truck, which is equipped with refrigerators, gas stoves, coffee pots, and the like.
    When the mobile canteen finds out that there are groups of people who want to buy food, it can immediately drive there and provide customers with hot sausages, breakfast, coffee, cocoa, and confectionery. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在伟大苏联的首都
    扩大机械扫雪的面积
    下雪天，莫斯科的街头往往要堆上厚厚的积雪。但是雪花还没有停止飞舞时，各个街道上担任扫雪的工作人员已经出动了。整晚的积雪，在清早短短的时间内就完全清扫干净。
    莫斯科的扫雪工作已一天天机械化。今年，全市机械化扫雪的街道面积将增加到一千六百五十万平方公尺。莫斯科各区拥有供扫雪用的各种机器、机械共一千四百部，其中有五百多部扫雪机和近一百五十部自动装雪机。今年还增添了新设备。这里将出现一种专门供比较狭窄的车辆单行道用的扫雪机。在住宅的院子里还将安装一千部瓦斯溶雪装置，以减轻打扫人的劳动。
    冬天继续绿化街道
    莫斯科冬季栽培树木、绿化街道的工作仍然在继续着。从郊区的许多公路上，汽车运来了许多多年生的树木。
    从莫斯科郊区的布隆尼茨基林场运来了一万二千株菩提树和枫树，这已经不是幼苗，而是已经活了十八年到二十年的树木。利用成长的树木绿化街道可以使费用大大降低。
    将火车票送到旅客家中
    莫斯科库尔斯克车站在今年内办理的将车票送到旅客家中的办法，深受旅客欢迎。旅客只须向车站的订票处打一个电话，或邮寄一个明信片，车站就如期将车票送到旅客住地。在今年头十个月中，这个车站共送了二十八万多张车票到旅客家中。
    这个车站还实行预订回程车票的办法。这种车票上记好了回来的日期、车次和车厢号码，回莫斯科时就不须再买车票了。
    流动食堂
    莫斯科的街道上出现了一种流动食堂。它是设在一个大汽车上，汽车里安装有冰箱、煤气炉、咖啡壶等。
    流动汽车食堂打听到那里有成群的人要买食品，自己马上就能开到那里去，供给顾客热香肠、早点、咖啡、可可和糖果点心。（据新华社讯）
