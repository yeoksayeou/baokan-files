Xinhua News Agency, December 30th. At the joint meeting of administrative leading cadres and trade union chairmen of enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, which closed on the 29th, basic measures were formulated to ensure that the Ministry of Heavy Industry system completes the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The meeting, based on the reports of Wang Heshou, Minister of Heavy Industry, and Zhao Guoqiang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Heavy Industry Trade Union, discussed and determined that the Ministry of Heavy Industry should widely adopt and promote dozens of major international advanced technologies and experiences, mainly Soviet technical experience, next year, and promote domestically effective advanced experiences to improve the level of production, construction, and geological work. The meeting believed that in order to systematically promote these technical experiences, all units must strengthen scientific experimentation and research, and systematically cultivate and train workers, engineering technicians, and management cadres. Next year, all units must further strengthen economic activity analysis, strengthen technical management, and do a good job in labor wages and employee welfare.

The meeting formulated specific measures suitable for the circumstances of the production, capital construction, and geological departments, based on the different situations of these departments. In terms of production, enterprises are required to vigorously trial-produce new products urgently needed by the state, improve economic and technical indicators, strengthen mining and ore dressing work, and prepare for the commissioning of new factories and mines. In terms of capital construction, design departments are required to make full use of standard designs, shorten design time, strive to submit drawings ahead of schedule, and strengthen design institutions, gradually developing towards specialization to ensure the smooth unfolding of construction. Construction departments are required to carry out factory-based and mechanized construction where conditions permit, establish advanced experience promotion stations, shorten construction time as much as possible, and systematically strengthen construction and installation forces to create conditions for larger-scale construction in the future. In terms of geological exploration, all units are required to accelerate the exploration speed and propose qualified ore reserves as early as possible to meet the needs of accelerating construction speed.

After discussion, the delegates criticized the conservative thinking that existed in the production and construction units in the past and unanimously believed that the potential of the production and construction units of the Ministry of Heavy Industry is still very large. Although various units have promoted many advanced technical experiences in the past three years, many units have not promoted them widely enough. Therefore, as long as all units earnestly mobilize employees to further promote these advanced experiences, the speed of production and construction can be greatly accelerated. In addition, there is great potential that can be brought into play in management and collaboration. The meeting called on workers, engineering technicians, and management cadres in the Ministry of Heavy Industry system to take active action, carry out inter-factory labor competitions, earnestly implement various measures, and ensure the early completion of the production and construction tasks stipulated in the state's first Five-Year Plan.

This meeting was jointly convened by the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the National Committee of the Chinese Heavy Industry Trade Union on December 22. During the meeting, Bo Yibo, Director of the Third Office of the State Council, made important instructions.

Xinhua News Agency, December 30th. In order to ensure the early completion of the production and capital construction plans of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the joint meeting of administrative leading cadres and trade union chairmen of enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry decided to vigorously carry out inter-factory competitions in fourteen trades and products next year. These fourteen trades and products are: five trades in the iron and steel industry system, including open-hearth steelmaking, special steel, ironmaking, coking, and steel rolling; seven trades and products in the basic chemical industry, including 666 (pesticide), synthetic ammonia (fertilizer), paint, and dyes; and two trades in the building materials industry, cement and glass.

The factory (mine) directors and trade union chairmen of the seventy-nine participating units have already signed the contracts for each inter-trade competition. In addition, managers and mine directors and trade union chairmen of enterprises in the non-ferrous metal industry, construction and installation, and geological exploration departments have also decided to carry out inter-factory or inter-factory trade competitions between mines and companies in batches by region next year.

    重工业部各企业行政和工会领导干部会议  
    制定提前完成五年计划的措施
    并确定明年大力开展厂际同工种竞赛
    新华社三十日讯　二十九日闭幕的重工业部所属企业行政领导干部和工会主席联席会议上，制定出了重工业部系统保证提前完成第一个五年计划的基本措施。
    会议根据重工业部部长王鹤寿和中国重工业工会全国委员会主席赵国强的报告，讨论确定了重工业部明年要广泛采用和推广几十种以苏联技术经验为主的重大国际先进技术经验，并且推广国内已经行之有效的先进经验，以提高生产、建设和地质工作的水平。会议认为，为了有计划地推广这些技术经验，各单位都必须加强科学试验研究工作，并且要有系统地培养和训练工人、工程技术人员和管理干部。明年，各单位必须进一步加强经济活动分析工作，加强技术管理，并且要做好劳动工资和职工福利工作。
    会议根据生产、基本建设和地质部门的不同情况，制定了适合于这些部门的情况的具体措施。在生产方面，要求各企业大力试制国家迫切需要的新产品，提高经济技术指标，加强矿山采矿和选矿工作，做好新建厂矿投入生产的准备工作。在基本建设方面，要求设计部门充分利用标准设计，缩短设计时间、争取提前交图，并且加强设计机构，逐步朝专业方向发展，以保证工程顺利地展开施工。要求施工部门有条件地进行工厂化、机械化施工，建立先进经验推广站，尽一切可能缩短施工时间，并且有计划地壮大建筑安装力量，为今后更大规模的建设创造条件。在地质勘探方面，要求各单位加快勘探速度，提早提出合乎要求的矿量，以满足加快建设速度的需要。
    到会代表经过讨论，批判了生产和建设单位过去存在的保守思想，一致认为，重工业部生产和建设单位的潜力仍然是很大的。过去三年来，各单位虽然推广了很多先进技术经验，但不少单位还推广得不够普遍。因此，只要各单位认真发动职工进一步推广这些先进经验，就可以大大加快生产和建设的速度。另外在管理和协作等方面，也有很大潜力可以发挥。会议号召重工业部系统工人、工程技术人员和管理干部都积极行动起来，开展厂际劳动竞赛，认真贯彻各项措施，保证提前完成国家第一个五年计划规定的生产建设任务。
    这次会议是重工业部和中国重工业工会全国委员会在十二月二十二日联合召开的。会议期间，国务院第三办公室主任薄一波到会作了重要指示。
    新华社三十日讯　为了保证提前完成重工业部生产和基本建设计划，重工业部所属企业行政领导干部和工会主席联席会议，确定在明年大力开展十四个工种和产品的厂际同工种竞赛。这十四个工种和产品是：钢铁工业系统的平炉炼钢、特殊钢、炼铁、炼焦、轧钢等五个工种；基本化学工业的六六六（农药）、合成氨（肥料）、油漆、染料等七个工种和产品，建筑材料工业的水泥、玻璃两个工种。
    参加竞赛的七十九个单位的厂（矿）长和工会主席已经分别在各个同工种竞赛的合同上签了字。此外，有色金属工业、建筑安装和地质勘探部门企业的经理、矿长和工会主席，也决定在明年按地区分批开展矿山、公司之间的厂际或厂际同工种竞赛。
