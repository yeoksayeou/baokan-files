The sugar factories in Nei Jiang Special District Start Production
The famous sugarcane production area of Sichuan Province, the five mechanized and semi-mechanized sugar factories in Nei Jiang Special District – Zi Zhong, San Yuan, Mao Shi, Long Shan, and Jian Yang – and the 672 native sugar workshops in the entire district, all began production around November 19th. This pressing season, the start time for the sugar factories and workshops was generally earlier than originally planned. Over 90% of the native sugar workshops have switched from producing sugar liquor entirely to producing sugar syrup, to ensure the production needs of the mechanized and semi-mechanized sugar factories. At the same time, sulfur fumigation equipment has been widely installed, which can not only improve the quality of the sugar, but also increase the sugar recovery rate by about 11%. With these methods alone, the sugar production rate this pressing season can increase by more than 19% compared to last year, resulting in an increase of 14.1 million *jin* of white sugar.

Before the start of production, the sugar factories and workshops made varying degrees of improvements in production and management. After the start of production, the workers of the sugar factories and workshops are enthusiastically launching labor competitions.

    内江专区各糖厂开榨生产
    四川省著名的蔗糖产区——内江专区的资中、三元、茂市、龙山、简阳五个机制和半机制糖厂，以及全区六百七十二个土糖坊，已经在十一月十九日前后全面开榨生产。本榨季，各糖厂、糖坊的开榨时间，一般都比原计划提前。百分之九十以上的土糖坊还由生产糖清全部改作糖浆生产，来保证机制和半机制糖厂的生产需要；同时普遍安装了硫熏设备，既可提高糖的质量，糖的收回率也能提高约百分之十一。仅上述的办法，本榨季糖的出产率就能在去年的基础上提高百分之十九以上，可以增产白糖一千四百十万市斤。
    开榨前，各糖厂、糖坊在生产、管理方面都作了不同程度的改进。开榨后，糖厂、糖坊职工正热烈地展开了劳动竞赛。
