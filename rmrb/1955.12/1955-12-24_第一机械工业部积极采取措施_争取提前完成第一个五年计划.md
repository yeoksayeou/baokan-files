Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: The First Ministry of Machine Building is taking measures to strive for the early completion of the production plan of the First Five-Year Plan. According to the draft production plan recently formulated by the ministry, the total production value of the First Ministry of Machine Building in 1956 will increase by more than 24% compared to the original annual target, so that the First Five-Year Plan can be completed ahead of schedule. The output of the ministry's main products, such as water tube boilers, steam turbines, generators, metal cutting machine tools, various plows, civilian ships, diesel engines, electric motors, mining and excavation equipment, metallurgical equipment, coking equipment, locomotives and rolling stock, power cables, ball bearings, and bicycles in 1956, will greatly exceed or reach the targets for 1957.

The new production plan targets for 1956, recently formulated by the First Ministry of Machine Building, were determined after repeated studies of the needs of various aspects of national construction and the existing potential capabilities of enterprises. In the past three years, in order to improve the technical level of machinery manufacturing and change the backwardness in equipment utilization and other aspects, the First Ministry of Machine Building has taken a series of measures in addition to stepping up the construction of new factories, reforming the technical equipment of existing factories, and trial-producing a large number of new products needed for various aspects of construction. This year and next year, more than a dozen new and rebuilt machine manufacturing plants under the First Ministry of Machine Building have been or will be put into production. After technical and organizational reforms, the production technology level of the old factories has been greatly improved, and nearly 2,000 new products urgently needed by the country have been successfully manufactured. This has created conditions for further发挥[fā huī] - bring into play the potential production capacity of the machinery manufacturing industry. Based on these circumstances, in the process of compiling the 1956 production plan, the First Ministry of Machine Building criticized the conservative ideas of cadres at all levels and decided to take effective measures to overfulfill the 1956 plan targets issued by the state.

The early completion of the production plan of the First Five-Year Plan by the state-owned machinery industry will enable various sectors of China's national economy to obtain more mechanical products, thereby accelerating the speed of technical transformation in various sectors of the national economy. According to preliminary statistics from the First Ministry of Machine Building, the total output value of the ministry in 1956 will increase by more than 40% compared to 1955. The output of major products, such as water tube boilers, will increase by 98% compared to 1955, steam turbines will increase fivefold compared to 1955, generators will increase 1.6 times, metal cutting machine tools will increase by 92%, double-wheel double-share plows in agricultural machinery will increase by 89%, tractor-drawn five-share plows will increase eightfold, locomotives will increase by more than double, and bicycles will increase by more than 40%.

Currently, the First Ministry of Machine Building is actively formulating measures to ensure the early completion of the five-year production plan. The responsible cadres of the ministry recently convened meetings of the leaders of subordinate factories in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Chongqing and other places, made mobilizations to strive for the early completion of the five-year plan, and required each factory to set specific goals and guarantee measures.

    第一机械工业部积极采取措施
    争取提前完成第一个五年计划
    新华社二十三日讯　第一机械工业部正在采取措施，争取提前完成第一个五年计划的生产计划。根据这个部最近制定的生产计划草案，第一机械工业部一九五六年的生产总值，将比原来规定的年度指标提高百分之二十四以上，这样就可以提前完成第一个五年计划。这个部的主要产品如水管锅炉、蒸汽透平、发电机、金属切削机床、各种犁、民用船舶、柴油机、电动机、矿山采掘设备、冶金设备、炼焦设备、机车车辆、电力电缆、滚珠轴承、自行车等的一九五六年的产量，都将大大超过或达到一九五七年的指标。
    第一机械工业部最近制定的一九五六年的新的生产计划指标，是在反覆地研究了国家各方面建设的需要和企业存在的潜在能力等情况以后确定的。过去三年中，第一机械工业部为了提高机械制造的技术水平，改变设备利用等方面的落后状况，除加紧进行新厂的建设以外，还采取一系列的措施，改造原有工厂的技术设备，大量试制各方面建设需要的新产品。在今年和明年内，第一机械工业部所属的十几个新建和改建的机器制造厂，已经或将要投入生产。旧有工厂经过技术上和组织上的改造以后，生产技术水平有了很大提高，并且制造成功了近两千种国家迫切需要的新产品。这样，就为进一步发挥机械制造工业的潜在生产能力创造了条件。第一机械工业部根据这些情况，在编制一九五六年生产计划的过程中，批判了各级干部的保守思想，并且决定采取有效措施超额完成国家颁布的一九五六年的计划指标。
    国营机械工业提前完成第一个五年计划的生产计划，将使我国国民经济各部门得到更多的机械产品，从而加速国民经济各部门技术改造的速度。据第一机械工业部初步统计：这个部一九五六年总产值将比一九五五年增加百分之四十几。主要产品的产量，如水管锅炉将比一九五五年增加百分之九十八，蒸汽透平将比一九五五年增加五倍，发电机增加一点六倍，金属切削机床增加百分之九十二，农业机械中双轮双铧犁增加百分之八十九，机引农具五铧犁增加八倍，机车增加一倍以上，自行车增加百分之四十以上。
    现在，第一机械工业部正在积极拟订保证提前完成五年生产计划的措施。这个部的负责干部最近在北京、沈阳、上海、重庆等地分别召集所属工厂的领导人员开会，作了争取提前完成五年计划的动员，并且要求各工厂订出具体的奋斗目标和保证措施。
