Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: The Second National Congress of the Chinese Store Employees' Union was held in Beijing from December 12th to 20th.

    The National Congress determined that the basic tasks of the Chinese Store Employees' Union in the future are: to closely connect with and educate the masses of employees, mobilize employees to actively participate in the socialist transformation of capitalist commerce; to carry out labor competitions, further improve service quality, and improve business management; to strengthen the construction of the trade union, promote the supervisory role of the masses, and gradually improve the working conditions and material and cultural life of the employees, and strive to ensure the completion and over-completion of the commercial tasks of the first five-year plan. In order to accomplish these tasks, the Congress emphasized that policy education must be strengthened for employees in private commerce, so that they can play an active role in promoting the socialist transformation of private commerce. With the development of the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, the work of employees in the commercial sector may be subject to some changes, so it is necessary to strengthen the unity within the employees, especially the unity between employees in private commerce and employees in state-owned commerce. In the state-owned commercial sector, the main task in the future is to overcome the tendency of formalism in labor competitions and push the labor competition to a new upsurge. The goals of the labor competition are to expand commodity circulation, accelerate capital turnover, reduce circulation costs, reduce commodity loss rates, and improve service quality, so as to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan. At present, strengthening property management, overcoming losses and waste, and reducing commodity loss rates should be taken as one of the main contents of the labor competition.
    The National Congress summarized the work since the First National Congress in August 1951. The Congress believes that in the past four years, the organizations at all levels of the Chinese Store Employees' Union have done a lot of work. About 80% of the more than 2 million commercial employees nationwide have joined trade union organizations, and the working conditions and material life of the employees have also been improved to a certain extent. In state-owned commerce, the Store Employees' Union organized the masses of employees to carry out labor competitions, and a large number of advanced workers and model workers emerged among them. Advanced working methods such as the joint shift system, the group business responsibility system, and the factory-mining contact responsibility system have been promoted, which have played a great role in improving business management, improving labor efficiency, and ensuring the completion of the national plan. In private commerce, the Store Employees' Union mobilized and organized the masses of employees to actively participate in the "Five-Anti" movement. After the "Five-Anti" movement, the vast number of shop assistants played an active role in supervising capitalists to change their business style and promoting capitalists to accept socialist transformation.
    The Congress also conducted detailed discussions on the issues of carrying out political, cultural, and professional and technical education for the masses of employees, doing a good job in labor protection and welfare work, and strengthening the organizational construction of trade unions, and made resolutions.
    The Congress also elected new trade union leadership organizations for the commercial sector and passed the "Proposal to the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China on Implementing the Eight-Hour Work System in Commercial and Foreign Trade Enterprises."
    The Congress unanimously passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    The Congress was attended by 449 representatives of trade union members from state-owned commerce, joint state-private commerce, and private commerce sectors.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: The Second National Congress of the Chinese Store Employees' Union, which closed today, unanimously passed the resolution to change the name of the Chinese Store Employees' Union to the Chinese Commercial Workers' Union, and determined that all state-owned commerce, urban consumer cooperatives, joint state-private and private commercial systems led by the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the commercial departments (bureaus) of provinces (cities) and autonomous regions, as well as employees of their affiliated units, can join the Chinese Commercial Workers' Union. The Congress elected Zhang Qingchun, Li Weixin and other 59 people as executive members of the National Committee of the Chinese Commercial Workers' Union, and Tian Sen and other 12 people as alternate executive members.

    中国店员工会全国代表大会在京举行
    中国店员工会改名为中国商业工会
    据新华社二十日讯　中国店员工会第二届全国代表大会十二月十二日到二十日在北京举行。
    这一届全国代表大会确定中国店员工会今后的基本任务是：密切联系和教育职工群众，发动职工积极参加对资本主义商业的社会主义改造；开展劳动竞赛，进一步提高服务质量，改善经营管理；加强工会建设，发扬群众的监督作用，并且逐步地改善职工群众的劳动条件和物质文化生活，为保证完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的商业任务而奋斗。为完成这些任务，大会着重指出，在私营商业中必须对职工加强政策教育，使他们在对私营商业进行社会主义改造的过程中，起着积极的推动作用。随着全行业公私合营工作的展开，商业部门职工的工作可能有些调动，因此必须加强职工内部的团结，特别是加强私营商业职工和国营商业职工的团结。在国营商业部门，今后的主要工作是，克服劳动竞赛中的形式主义的偏向，把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨。劳动竞赛的目标，是扩大商品流通，加速资金周转，降低流转费用，降低商品损耗率，提高服务质量，以保证全面完成国家计划。目前应该把加强财产管理、克服损失和浪费、降低商品损耗率，作为劳动竞赛的主要内容之一。
    这一届全国代表大会总结了一九五一年八月第一届全国代表大会以来的工作。大会认为，四年来，中国店员工会各级组织做了不少工作。全国约二百多万商业职工中已经有百分之八十加入了工会组织，职工的劳动条件和物质生活也有了一定程度的改善。在国营商业中，店员工会组织职工群众开展了劳动竞赛，在他们当中涌现了大批的先进工作者和劳动模范，推广了连带上班制、小组营业责任制、厂矿联系责任制等先进工作方法，对改善经营管理、提高劳动效率、保证完成国家计划，都起了很大作用。在私营商业中，店员工会发动和组织职工群众积极参加了“五反”运动；“五反”运动以后，广大店员在监督资本家改变经营作风、推动资本家接受社会主义改造等方面都起了积极作用。
    大会对于开展职工群众的政治、文化和业务技术教育，搞好劳保福利工作以及加强工会的组织建设等问题也进行了详细的讨论，并作出了决议。
    大会还选出了商业部门新的工会领导机构并通过了“关于在商业和对外贸易企业中实行八小时工作制向中华人民共和国商业部和对外贸易部的建议”。
    大会一致通过了向毛主席和中国人民解放军的致敬电。
    出席大会的，有国营商业、公私合营商业和私营商业部门的工会会员代表四百四十九人。
    据新华社二十日讯　今天闭幕的中国店员工会第二届全国代表大会一致通过把中国店员工会改名为中国商业工会，并确定凡是商业部、对外贸易部、各省（市）、自治区商业厅（局）所领导的国营商业、城市消费合作社、公私合营和私营商业系统的职工及其附属单位的职工，都可以加入中国商业工会。大会选举了张庆春、李维新等五十九人为中国商业工会全国委员会的执行委员，田森等十二人为候补执行委员。
