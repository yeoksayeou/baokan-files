    The Friendship Between the Chinese and German People is Unbreakable
    Cheng Guangrui

    In October 1949, a few days after the birth of the People's Republic of China on the Asian continent, the German Democratic Republic was also born on the European continent. The almost simultaneous emergence of these two people's democratic countries fundamentally changed the face of Asia and Europe.

    The Chinese people, having gained independence and freedom, warmly welcomed the birth of the German Democratic Republic with a feeling of shared destiny with the German people, and were excited and encouraged by the addition of this new brother and strong friend to the socialist camp of peace and democracy.

    After establishing their own people's democratic regimes according to their own will, the Chinese and German people embarked on the common path of building socialism side by side, participating in the common struggle to defend world peace. In this great cause, the Chinese and German people occupy a special position, as Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized: "The People's Germany and the People's China are at the forefront of the great struggle against imperialism."

    It is this common revolutionary change and common struggle that laid the solid foundation for the friendship between the Chinese and German people.

    For more than six years, the friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic have made considerable progress and have been continuously strengthened.

    The development of friendly relations between the Chinese and German people is first manifested in the mutual sympathy and support of the two peoples for each other's just struggles. The German people's struggle for peaceful reunification, the establishment of European collective security, and the defense of European peace have always received the sympathy and support of the Chinese people; similarly, the German Democratic Republic and the German people have always sympathized with and supported the Chinese people's struggle against imperialist aggression and for the defense of Asian peace. The two peoples know that this struggle they are waging simultaneously in the East and West is closely related. The communiqué of the talks between Premier Grotewohl and Premier Zhou Enlai on July 25, 1954, fully demonstrated the mutual concern and support between the Chinese and German people in the great cause of peace. Chairman Mao Zedong's order of April 7, 1955, on ending the state of war between the People's Republic of China and Germany was another important development in the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese and German people. The great significance of this order, as pointed out by President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic, is a new and clear manifestation of the great trust of the Chinese people in the peace-loving forces of the German people.

    The nationwide "German-Chinese Friendship Month" movement held in the German Democratic Republic in June 1951 played an important role in strengthening the friendly relations between the two peoples. Through the "German-Chinese Friendship Month" movement, the German people further understood the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the tremendous achievements in China's economic and cultural construction. The Chinese delegation participating in the "German-Chinese Friendship Month" also learned about the struggle and life of the German people through visits to sixty-three cities and villages in the German Democratic Republic and direct contact with more than 400,000 people. This mutual understanding strengthened the friendship between the two peoples and became an important force in inspiring the struggle of the two peoples.

    In recent years, the economic and cultural relations between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic have also been developing and consolidating.

    Since the implementation of the Sino-German trade agreement in 1951, trade between the two countries has increased year by year. The volume of Sino-German barter trade in 1955 was three times that of 1951. At the same time, the variety has also increased compared to before. In 1951, China exported 48 items to the German Democratic Republic, while in 1955, it had reached 111 items, including minerals, livestock products, food, silk, and local products that are necessary for the national economy. Germany is a country with highly developed industrial production and science and technology. The optical precision instrument industry, heavy machinery manufacturing industry, machine tool manufacturing industry, and vehicle manufacturing industry of the German Democratic Republic have always accounted for a large part of exports to our country. In order to meet the needs of China's industrialization, the German Democratic Republic supplies our country with complete sets of industrial equipment, entire factories, and specially ordered products. The advanced industrial technology assistance provided by the German Democratic Republic to our country is based on fraternal cooperation, and this assistance plays an important role in accelerating the cause of socialist construction in our country. For example, the newly built highly mechanized and semi-automated state-owned Baotou Sugar Factory in our country is equipped with all new-style machines imported from the German Democratic Republic and was established with the help of German experts. In addition, the results of scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries have strengthened the exchange of important experiences and knowledge in the industrial and agricultural production of the two countries, thereby accelerating the development of the construction undertakings of the two countries.

    China and Germany are both countries with excellent cultural traditions. The development of cultural exchanges between the Chinese and German people is of great significance for strengthening the friendly relations between the two peoples. The German people have enriched the treasure house of human spirit with immortal contributions in philosophy, science, music, and literature. The great German geniuses Marx and Engels, Schiller, Goethe, Heine, and Beethoven are forever revered by the Chinese people. This year, the Chinese people joined the German people and peace-loving people all over the world in commemorating the 150th anniversary of the death of the great German poet Schiller. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, especially after the signing of the cultural cooperation agreement between the two countries in 1951, cultural exchanges between the two countries became increasingly frequent. The two countries have strengthened mutual learning and understanding through mutual visits by scientists, artists, literary workers, performing groups, sports teams, and other delegations, reciprocal translation and publication of books in science, literature, and art, holding exhibitions, and sending students and graduate students. This extensive cultural exchange is of great significance for the development of all aspects of culture in the two countries.

    The friendship between the Chinese and German people is based on the new type of relationship between the countries of the socialist camp of peace and democracy. The friendly and cooperative relations between the two peoples not only conform to the interests of the two peoples and are conducive to the socialist construction undertakings of the two countries, but also help to strengthen the strength of the socialist camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union and the cause of defending world peace.

    The Chinese and German people live together in the vast and powerful socialist camp of peace and democracy from Beijing to Berlin, and are constantly developing close relations, as Premier Grotewohl said: "Hearts are connected, and friendship is seamless." The visit to our country by the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Premier Grotewohl will undoubtedly play a huge role in promoting the further development of friendly relations between the Chinese and German people and strengthening the common struggle of the Chinese and German people. The fraternal friendship between the Chinese and German people is unbreakable, and the common cause of the two peoples will surely be victorious.

    中德人民的友谊牢不可破
    程光锐
    一九四九年十月，中华人民共和国在亚洲大陆上诞生几天后，德意志民主共和国也在欧洲大陆上诞生了。这两个人民民主国家几乎同时的出现，根本改变了亚洲和欧洲的面貌。
    获得了独立自由的中国人民，怀着同德国人民休戚相关的心情，热烈欢迎德意志民主共和国的诞生，并为着在和平民主社会主义阵营里增加了这个新的兄弟和坚强的朋友而兴奋鼓舞。
    中德两国人民在按照自己的意志建立了自己的人民民主政权以后，又并肩走上了建设社会主义的共同道路，参加了保卫世界和平的共同斗争。在这个伟大的事业中，中德两国人民占着特殊的地位，正如毛泽东同志强调指出的：“人民的德国和人民的中国同处在反对帝国主义的伟大斗争的最前线。”
    正是这种共同的革命变化和共同的斗争，奠定了中德两国人民友谊的坚固基础。
    六年多来，中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的友好关系，有了长足的发展和不断地加强。
    中德人民友好关系的发展，首先表现在两国人民对彼此的正义斗争的互相同情和支持上。德国人民争取和平统一、建立欧洲集体安全和保卫欧洲和平的斗争一向得到中国人民的同情和支持；同样地，德意志民主共和国和德国人民也一向同情和支持中国人民反对帝国主义侵略、保卫亚洲和平的斗争。两国人民知道，他们同时在东方和西方进行的这个斗争是密切相关的。一九五四年七月二十五日格罗提渥总理和周恩来总理的会谈公报，充分表现了中德两国人民在伟大的和平事业中的互相关怀和支持。一九五五年四月七日毛泽东主席发布的关于结束中华人民共和国同德国之间的战争状态的命令，是中德人民友好合作关系的又一重要发展。这项命令的重大意义正如德意志民主共和国皮克总统所指出的，它是中国人民对德国人民爱好和平的力量的伟大信任的一个新的明显表现。
    一九五一年六月德意志民主共和国举行的全国规模的“德中友好月”运动，对于加强两国人民友好关系起了重要的作用。通过“德中友好月”运动，德国人民进一步了解了中国人民革命的伟大胜利和中国经济和文化建设的巨大成就。参加“德中友好月”的中国代表团，也通过对德意志民主共和国的六十三个城市乡村的访问和同四十万以上的人民的直接接触，了解了德国人民的斗争和生活，这种相互的了解加强了两国人民之间的友谊，成为鼓舞两国人民的斗争的重要力量。
    几年来，中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的经济和文化关系也日益发展和巩固。
    自从一九五一年开始执行中德贸易协定以来，两国之间的贸易往来逐年增加。一九五五年的中德换货数量比一九五一年增加了三倍。同时，在品类方面也比以前增加了。一九五一年我国向德意志民主共和国输出的货物为四十八项，而一九五五年已达到一百一十一项了，其中包括矿产品、畜产品、食品、绸缎、土产品等国民经济所必需的物资。德国是工业生产和科学技术高度发展的国家。德意志民主共和国的光学精密仪器工业、重型机器制造业、工作母机制造业和车辆制造业一直占对我国输出的大部分。为了适应我国工业化的需要，德意志民主共和国供给我国整套工业设备、整个工厂和专门订制的产品。德意志民主共和国给予我国的先进的工业技术的帮助是建立在兄弟般合作的基础上的，这种援助对于我国加速实现社会主义建设的事业起着重要的作用。例如我国新建的高度机械化和半自动化的国营包头糖厂，就是用从德意志民主共和国输入的全部新式机器装备起来，并在德国专家的帮助下建立起来的。此外，两国进行的科学技术合作的结果，加强了两国工业和农业生产中重要经验和知识的交流，从而加速了两国建设事业的发展。
    中国和德国都是有着优良文化传统的国家。中德人民文化交流的发展，对于加强两国人民友好关系具有重要的意义。德国人民以在哲学、科学、音乐、文学各方面的不朽贡献丰富了人类精神的宝库。德国人民的伟大天才马克思和恩格斯、席勒、歌德、海涅和贝多芬永远受到中国人民的崇敬。今年中国人民同德国人民和全世界爱好和平人民一起纪念了德国伟大的诗人席勒逝世一百五十周年。中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国成立以后，尤其是一九五一年中德两国签订了文化合作协定以后，两国文化交流日益频繁。两国通过科学、艺术、文学工作者以及表演团、体育队和其他代表团的相互访问，交互翻译出版科学、文学、艺术等方面的书籍，举办展览会，派遣留学生和研究生等等，加强了相互的学习和了解。这种广泛的文化交流对于两国文化各方面的发展有着巨大意义。
    中德两国人民的友谊是建立在和平民主社会主义阵营各国之间的新型关系的基础上的。两国人民友好合作关系不但符合两国人民的利益，有助于两国社会主义建设事业，而且有助于增强以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的力量和保卫世界和平的事业。
    中德两国人民共同生活在从北京到柏林的广大雄强的和平民主社会主义阵营中，不断发展着亲密的关系，正如格罗提渥总理所说的：“心心相连，友好无间”。这次以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团来我国访问，对于促进中德两国人民友好关系的进一步发展和加强中德两国人民的共同斗争，无疑将起巨大的作用。中德人民的兄弟般友谊是牢不可破的，两国人民的共同事业一定胜利。
