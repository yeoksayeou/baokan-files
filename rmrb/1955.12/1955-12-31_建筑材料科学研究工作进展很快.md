Building materials industry's technical and scientific research work, in recent years with the help of Soviet experts, and due to the active efforts of technical science workers and employees of building materials factories, has made remarkable achievements. These achievements have greatly promoted the development of the building materials industry.

In terms of cement, by learning from the advanced Soviet technology of multi-variety and multi-grade cement, through experimental research, the full utilization of blast furnace slag (a byproduct of iron smelting), shale (coal mine waste), and limestone sandstone as mixed materials, were added into the cement to produce ordinary cement, slag cement, red shale cement, mixed cement, etc., suitable for various projects above ground, underground, and in water. At the same time, various cements are divided into grades such as "Grade 200," "Grade 300," "Grade 400," and "Grade 500" according to their strength, to meet the needs of different projects. This pioneering initiative of gradually expanding from one type of cement to multi-variety and multi-grade cements has advanced China's cement industry's technical level a big step forward, and has played a significant role in the industrial recovery and construction of recent years. According to statistics, due to the adoption of this experience by cement plants across the country, it is equivalent to adding the production capacity of three large-scale cement plants, ensuring and improving the quality of construction projects. In addition, according to Soviet experience, experimental research work has been carried out on aluminate cement, plugging cement, non-shrinkage impermeable cement, white cement, non-clinker cement, etc. These research results meet the needs of special construction projects and civil construction projects.

Cement plants under the Building Materials Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, after experimental research, have universally promoted the advanced Soviet experience of rapid rotary kilns, increasing the rotation speed of rotary kilns by 30% to 100%, and increasing the hourly output of cement clinker by 15% to 30%, greatly advancing the operational technical level of workers, and pointing out the direction for technical improvements in the cement industry. In order to increase the lifespan of fire bricks in rotary kilns and be able to withstand higher temperatures, creating favorable conditions for increasing cement production and quality, new Soviet water-cooling technology for rotary kiln shells, which is being promoted and applied, has also been experimentally studied. This can improve the quality of cement clinker, further improve workers' technical operating skills, and ensure the safe operation of equipment.

Workers in the cement industry have also made many contributions in technical and scientific work. The kiln firemen of the Guangzhou Cement Plant, under the guidance of technicians, collectively created experience in long-term safe operation. Recently, their plant's No. 3 rotary kiln achieved a record of 367 days of safe operation. Other factories are promoting this experience. If cement plants across the country can operate safely for 300 days, it can greatly save repair costs and also increase cement production by 466,000 tons, creating a total of more than 22 million yuan of wealth for the country in a year. Wang Xiliang, a cadre from the Mudanjiang Cement Plant who started as a kiln fireman, invented a discharge plate for rotary kilns, which solved the key problem of crushing material balls affecting ventilation in the kiln, increasing hourly output by 17.6%. After the promotion and use of this type of discharge plate in similar cement plants, it can increase cement production by 52,300 tons per year.

In the reconstruction of cement plants, technical and scientific workers have also cooperated in carrying out many experimental research projects. In the past year alone, they have cooperated in the reconstruction of four rotary kilns in the Taiyuan Cement Plant and the Jinxi Cement Plant, achieving good results in increasing production and improving operations.

As for the glass industry, sanitary ceramics industry, asbestos cement tile industry, and cement pipe industry, improvements in the operating technology of glass melting furnaces, drawing machines, and gas furnaces are all the results of scientific research, thus bringing many technical and economic norms close to Soviet levels. In addition, through scientific research work, tempered glass with anti-seismic properties has been trial-produced, which can be supplied to automobiles, ships, factories, etc.; the styles and varieties of sanitary ceramics have also been improved and increased, and a variety of styles of paving tiles have been produced, as well as new products such as medical equipment, gas filter discs, and women's washing devices for special purposes; Soviet standard large-wave asbestos cement tiles have also been trial-produced and produced, which can increase the span of building roofs and save construction costs; and reinforced concrete pipes that can withstand certain pressures have also been trial-produced, which can replace steel cast iron pipes for water supply pipelines.

According to the development of the building materials industry and the needs of national economic construction, the Building Materials Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry will cooperate with relevant departments to further strengthen scientific research work. In the next two years, it will experiment with and promote the Soviet experience of strong ventilation in cement grinding to reduce power consumption and the wear of grinding media; it will experiment with and adopt heat exchangers to improve heat energy utilization and reduce coal consumption. In addition, it will study the utilization of industrial waste products, research and improve thermal control and the installation of automatic instruments, and research and trial-produce various new products.

    建筑材料科学研究工作进展很快
    建筑材料工业技术科学研究工作，几年来在苏联专家的帮助下，由于技术科学工作者和建筑材料工业各厂职工的积极努力，取得了显著成就。这些成就大大地推进了建筑材料工业的发展。
    在水泥方面，由于学习了苏联水泥多品种多标号的先进技术，经试验研究，充分利用了炼铁炉副产品矿渣、煤矿废弃物页岩和石灰石砂岩等作为混合材料，掺入水泥中制成适于地上、地下以及水中各种工程用的普通水泥、矿渣水泥、赤页岩水泥、混合水泥等。同时把各种水泥按强度高低分为“二百号”“三百号”“四百号”“五百号”等标号，以满足不同要求的工程需要。这样由一种水泥逐渐扩大为多品种多标号水泥的创举，使我国水泥工业技术水平前进了一大步，对几年来的工业恢复和建设起了很大作用。据统计，由于全国水泥厂都吸取了这一经验，等于增添了三个大型水泥厂的生产量，保证和提高了建筑工程的质量。这以外，还根据苏联经验，进行了矾土水泥、堵塞水泥、无收缩性不透水水泥、白色水泥、无熟料水泥等的试验研究工作。这些研究成果满足了特殊建筑工程和民用建筑工程的需要。
    重工业部建筑材料工业管理局所属水泥厂，经过试验研究，普遍地推广了苏联先进经验快速转窑，使回转窑的旋转速度增高百分之三十到一百，水泥熟料每小时产量提高了百分之十五到三十，把工人的操作技术水平大大推进了一步，并给水泥工业技术改进指出了方向。为了增进回转窑内火砖的寿命并能耐受更高温度，给提高水泥产量、质量创 造有利条件，还试验研究了苏联正在推广应用的回转窑胴体水冷却新技术，它可以使水泥熟料的质量得到提高。这更提高了工人技术操作水平，保证了设备的安全运转。
    水泥工业的工人们在技术科学工作上也作了不少贡献。广州水泥厂回转窑看火工人，在技师指导下，集体创造了长期安全运转的经验。最近他们厂第三号回转窑上创造了安全运转三百六十七天的纪录。其他厂正在推广这一经验。如果全国水泥厂都能安全运转到三百天，可以大大节省修理费用，还可以增产水泥四十六万六千吨，总计一年可以为国家创造二千二百多万元的财富。牡丹江水泥厂回转窑看火工人出身的干部王喜良，创造的回转窑下料板，解决了料球压碎影响窑内通风的关键问题，使每小时产量增加百分之十七点六。同类型的水泥厂推广使用这种下料板以后，一年可以增产水泥五万二千三百吨。
    在水泥厂改建中，技术科学工作者们也配合着进行了许多试验研究工作。最近一年内，就曾经配合改建了太原水泥厂和锦西水泥厂的四座回转窑，使在增加产量和改善操作方面，都获得很好成绩。
    至于玻璃工业、卫生陶瓷器工业、石绵水泥瓦工业、水泥管工业方面，玻璃熔窑、引上机、煤气炉等操作技术的改善，都是科学研究工作的成果，因而使许多技术经济定额接近了苏联水平。另外，通过科学研究工作，试制了具有防震性能的钢化玻璃，可以供应汽车、轮船、厂房等的需要；还改进和增加了卫生陶瓷器的形式、品种，生产了多种样式的铺地砖，以及供给特殊用途的医疗器、滤气盘、妇女洗涤器等新产品；还试制和生产了苏联标准大波石绵水泥瓦，它可以增大建筑物屋架的跨度并节省建筑费用；还试制了能耐一定压力的钢筋混凝土管，可以代替钢筋铁铸管用为上水管道。
    根据建筑材料工业发展情况和国民经济建设的需要，重工业部建筑材料工业管理局将配合有关部门，进一步加强科学研究工作。今后两年内，将试验、推广水泥磨强力通风的苏联经验，以减少电耗和研磨体的损耗；将试验、采用热交换器，以改进热能利用，降低煤的损耗。这以外，将研究利用工业废品，研究改进热工控制和安装自动仪表，以及研究试制各种新产品。
