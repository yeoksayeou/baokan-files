    Zhongshan County's "Thousand Catties Per Mu" Manure Accumulation Campaign
    Wu Erxiang
    Before this year's autumn harvest, the peasants of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, used the slack season and combined it with the work of establishing agricultural cooperatives to launch a mass "thousand catties per mu" manure accumulation campaign. The corners of farmers' houses, threshing floors, and open spaces were covered with black river mud and pond mud; the dried river mud and pond mud were piled up like small mountains.
    Zhongshan County is located in the Pearl River Delta's alluvial plain area. Here, rivers crisscross and ponds are densely distributed. River mud and pond mud are inexhaustible and contain abundant organic matter, making them natural fertilizers. If 1,000 catties of dry pond mud are applied per mu of paddy field, it is equivalent to applying 20 catties of ammonium sulfate, enough for half or most of the fertilizer needed for a season of rice. Farmers in the Pearl River Delta have traditionally dug river mud and pond mud for fertilizer. However, large-scale drying and application of river mud and pond mud like this only began after this summer's planting.
    During this summer's planting season, the third generation of rice borers was at its peak. The late rice seedlings in Henglan District of Zhongshan County were severely threatened. The eighty mu of seedlings of the "August 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Henglan Township were almost eaten up by rice borers. Farmers came up with many ways to control the pests, but none of them worked. At this time, the district head of Henglan District remembered hearing someone at a meeting in central Guangdong saying that dry river mud mixed with "666" powder could kill insects, so he decided to try this method. He first mobilized the agricultural production cooperative to get dry river mud and tested it on the cooperative's eighty mu of seedlings, applying a mixture of 120 catties of dry river mud and three catties of "666" insecticide powder per mu of seedling field. Less than three days after this mixture was spread, the withered and yellow seedlings began to turn green again. After Henglan District promoted this method, the third generation of rice borers was eliminated. Many farmers also mixed dry river mud, "666" insecticide powder, and ammonium sulfate together. They called this mixture "San Lao," which could kill the larvae in the dead hearts of seedlings and promote growth. Henglan District universally applied "San Lao" to late rice this year, which basically eliminated pests and achieved a bumper harvest rarely seen in the past, with "only grains and no white ears." Because of this effective pest control method, farmers' confidence in production has greatly increased. Farmers in Henglan Township plan to change 12,000 mu of double-cropping interplanted rice to double-cropping continuous rice next year, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the township's paddy field area, double the amount of this year.
    In September this year, Henglan District summarized the experience of using "San Lao" in late rice and, seizing the opportunity of the slack season before autumn, combined it with the work of establishing agricultural cooperatives to launch a "thousand catties per mu" manure accumulation campaign. Farmers in Sisha Township proposed the method of "production in the morning, meetings in the afternoon and evening," so that the work of establishing cooperatives would not hinder production. More than 1,000 people in the township participated in manure accumulation every day. Farmers in Henglan Township lit carbide lamps at night to dig mud, and six agricultural production cooperatives accumulated more than 9 million catties of dry river mud in two days. The experience of Henglan District was soon promoted throughout the county. At present, the county has accumulated more than 10 million dan of dry river mud and pond mud. Henglan, Minzhong, Gangkou, and Dagang districts have all overfulfilled the "thousand catties per mu" manure accumulation task. Henglan District has accumulated an average of more than 2,000 catties of dry river mud per mu. This not only solves the fertilizer problem needed for expanding the winter planting area this year, but also provides favorable conditions for increasing grain production next year. In early November, the CCP Yuezhong District Committee issued a circular on promoting the "thousand catties per mu" manure accumulation campaign, calling on the entire district to promote the experience of Zhongshan County.

    中山县的“每亩千斤”积肥运动
    吴尔祥
    广东省中山县农民，在今年秋收前，利用农闲空隙，结合秋前办社工作，展开了一次群众性的“每亩千斤”积肥运动。农家的屋角、地堂和空地上，到处都铺满了乌黑的河泥、塘泥；晒干了的河泥、塘泥，也堆得像小山一样。
    中山县在珠江三角洲上的沙田地区。这里河流纵横，池沼密布。河泥、塘泥是取之不尽的，含有丰富的有机质的自然肥料。如果每亩稻田施用一千斤干塘泥，就等于施用二十斤硫酸铵，足够一季水稻所需肥料的一半或大部分。珠江三角洲上的农民过去就有挖河泥、塘泥做肥料的习惯。但是像这样大规模地把河泥、塘泥晒干施用的事情，只是今年夏种后才开始的。
    今年夏种期间，正是第三代螟虫盛发期。中山县横栏区的晚稻秧苗受到严重的威胁。横栏乡“八一”农业生产合作社的八十亩秧几乎给螟虫吃光了。农民们想出了许多种治虫办法，没有一件有效果。这时横栏区的区长，想起在粤中开会的时候曾听到有人说用干河泥混合“六六六”粉可以杀虫，就决定试一试这个办法。他首先动员农业生产合作社去弄干河泥，在社里的八十亩秧地上试验，每亩秧地混合施用一百二十斤干河泥和三斤“六六六”杀虫粉。这种混合物撒下去不到三天，枯黄的秧苗便开始回青了。横栏区推广这个办法后，就消灭了第三代螟虫。许多农民还把干河泥、“六六六”杀虫粉连硫酸铵一起混合施用，他们把这种混合物叫做“三捞”，它既能杀死枯心苗内的幼虫，又能起催生的作用。横栏区今年晚稻普遍施用了“三捞”，因而基本上消灭了虫害，出现了历来少见的“只见谷粒，不见白穗”的大丰收。因为有了这个行之有效的治虫办法，农民的生产信心大大提高了。横栏乡农民计划明年把一万二千亩双季间作稻改为双季连作稻，这个数字占全乡水田面积的百分之八十以上，比今年增加了一倍。
    今年九月间，横栏区总结了晚稻使用“三捞”的经验，并且抓紧秋前农闲期间，结合办社工作，开展“每亩千斤”积肥运动。四沙乡农民提出“上午生产，下午和晚上开会”的办法，使建社工作不妨碍生产。全乡每天参加积肥的有一千多人。横栏乡农民晚上点起汽灯挖泥，六个农业生产合作社在两天内就积了干河泥九百多万斤。横栏区的这个经验不久又在全县推广起来。目前全县已积干河泥、塘泥一千万担以上。横栏、民众、港口、大岗等四个区，都超额完成了“每亩千斤”的积肥任务。横栏区平均每亩已经积干河泥两千斤以上。这不但解决了今年扩大冬种面积所需要的肥料问题，而且为明年增产粮食提供了有利条件。中共粤中区委会在十一月初为此发出了关于推广“每亩千斤”积肥运动的通报，号召全区推广中山县的这一经验。
