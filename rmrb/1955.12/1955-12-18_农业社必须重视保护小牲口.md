    Agricultural Cooperatives Must Emphasize the Protection of Small Livestock

    (I) Editor:
    In the agricultural cooperativization movement in the Third District of Andong County, Liaoning Province, a noteworthy problem has been discovered: many agricultural production cooperatives only purchase or rent stronger livestock, so a large number of small livestock are not properly cared for. It is estimated that each village has forty to seventy head of livestock that agricultural production cooperatives are unwilling to take, most of which are young animals. Farmers are very anxious about this problem. Jiang Qingtong of Dahe Village said, "Now that everyone has joined the cooperative and works there all day, where do we have time to take care of the calves at home!" Liu Fuyuan of Changpao Village said, "It's good to join the cooperative, but what about my calf? Selling it doesn't bring much money, and no one wants it; slaughtering it for food is not allowed by the government; raising it myself means no one to look after it and no grass to feed it. It's really worrying!" Many small livestock have become thin from starvation or have been injured on the mountains because they are not cared for. Theft and slaughter of livestock have also occurred in individual villages.

    After the District Committee discovered these problems, it made specific arrangements. The more than sixty "surplus" livestock of the Heping Cooperative in Dahe Village have been organized into two cattle herds using the method of private ownership and public feeding. Other cooperatives have also organized many cattle herds by adopting methods such as valuation and purchase by the cooperative and valuation for investment and profit sharing.

    (II) Editor:
    In many newly established cooperatives in Lin颍 County, Henan Province, the following saying is prevalent: it is not worthwhile to feed small livestock, it's a loss every day, it's better to sell them. The deputy director of the Ninth Cooperative of Tengsi Township in Wanggang District said, "The cooperative is full of small donkeys and calves, how can we improve production? It's better to simply sell them and buy bigger ones." Among the sixty-nine cooperatives in Wanggang District, a total of four hundred and seven head of small livestock were deemed unusable and had to be sold by cooperative cadres. Some cooperatives, seeing that small livestock were cheap, proposed slaughtering them for meat. For example, the Liu Fulai Cooperative in Xijia Township, Taicheng District, had eight head of small livestock, and the person in charge of the cooperative said, "We can't use them, and we can't sell them, so let's slaughter them and divide them among the members!" Some cooperatives, knowing that the government does not allow the slaughter of draft animals, plan to not feed the small livestock properly, let them become weak and sick, and then slaughter them. Song Shuting, a member of the Third Cooperative of Wang Shaoyu Township, Wadian District, has already strangled his small livestock to death on the pretext of a shortage of fodder.

    After the Lin颍 County Committee discovered this situation, it is studying solutions. This situation may also exist in other regions and deserves widespread attention.

### 农业社必须重视保护小牲口

    农业社必须重视保护小牲口
    （一）编辑同志：
    辽宁省安东县三区在农业合作化运动中，发现了一个值得注意的问题：不少农业生产合作社只收买或租用较强的牲口，因此就有很大一批小牲畜得不到妥善的饲养。据估计，农业生产合作社不愿要的牲口，每村都有四十头到七十头，其中大部分都是牲口崽子。农民对这个问题很焦急。大河村姜庆同说：“人都入社了，成天在社里干活，哪有工夫照顾家里的小牛呀！”长泡村刘福源说：“参加合作社好是好，可是我这小牛崽子怎办呢？往外卖，值钱少，又没人要；杀了吃，政府不允许；自己养，既没人看管，又没草喂。真愁坏人！”有许多小牲口因为无人喂养，已经饿瘦了，或者在山上磕坏了。在个别村子里还发生了偷杀牲口的事情。
    区委发现了这些问题以后，已经作了具体安排。大河村和平社六十多头“剩余”牲口，采取私有公喂的办法搞了两个牛群，其他社也采取估价由社收买和作价投资分红等办法组织了不少牛群。中共安东县委会　贾　峰（二）编辑同志：在河南临颍县不少新建社中，普遍流行着这样一种说法：喂小牲口不合算，喂一天赔一天，不如卖了好。王岗区滕寺乡九社副社长说：“社里净是些小驴小牛，怎能搞好生产？不如干脆卖了买大的。”在王岗区六十九个社中，被社干部认为不能用而必须卖掉的小牲口共有四百零七头。有的社看到小牲口价格便宜，就提出要宰杀吃肉。像台陈区席贾乡刘富来社有八头小牲口，社里的负责人说：“使又不能使，卖又卖不了，还是宰了给社员分着吃吧！”有的社知道政府不准宰杀耕畜，就打算对小牲口不好好喂养，让它们瘦弱成疾，然后再来宰杀。瓦店区王绍于乡第三社社员宋树亭借口缺草料，已经将自己的小牲口勒死了。
    临颍县委发现这种情况以后，已经在研究解决办法。这种情况在其它地区可能也有，值得引起普遍的重视。
