"Zhiyan Zhai's Re-evaluated Story of the Stone" has been published, and the "New Redology School's" "bottom line" has been revealed.

Chinese classical literary masterpieces often have commentary versions by someone. The commentator adds their own commentary to the work, indicating their view of it. In a broad sense, this commentary can also be said to be a form of literary criticism. When studying classical literary masterpieces, these commentaries should be researched as necessary, and they should be properly evaluated from a scientific point of view. Even if some commentators' views may be very reactionary, such as Jin Shengtan's revision of Water Margin, we can still learn from it the different views of different classes in history on the same work, which can help further explore the social significance of this work and its historical repercussions. Therefore, when studying Dream of the Red Chamber, we should also treat the "Zhiyan Zhai Commentary" with the same attitude.

It is quite common to use ancient people's commentary on works. However, due to the different viewpoints of researchers, completely different attitudes have emerged. Since the "May Fourth Movement," the Hu Shi faction has often regarded so-called "rare" commentaries as the magic weapon for solving all problems, which is even more prominent in the study of Dream of the Red Chamber. Since the discovery of several Zhiyan Zhai commentary versions of Dream of the Red Chamber, the "Zhi Commentary" has been regarded as the supreme magic weapon by the "New Redology School," creating a chaotic and mysterious atmosphere.

How does the "New Redology School" view the "Zhi Commentary"? In his "Textual Research on Dream of the Red Chamber," Hu Shi distorted Dream of the Red Chamber into a "plain and unremarkable naturalistic" work. After the discovery of the Zhi Commentary version of Dream of the Red Chamber, he used the "Zhi Commentary" to further strengthen his reactionary conclusion, believing that "these places can help prove that Dream of the Red Chamber is a book recording the facts of the Cao family, and can destroy a lot of doubt," "Therefore, Dream of the Red Chamber is about the Cao family, and this point has now gained a lot of new evidence and is even more irrefutable." (Hu Shi's Collected Works, Series 3: 573, 575). Yu Pingbo's so-called "autobiographical theory," "concept of form and emptiness," and "traditionalism," etc., are all based on the "Zhi Commentary." Zhou Ruchang in "New Evidence for Dream of the Red Chamber" still did not jump out of the mud pit of the "New Redology School." Although his views on individual issues in the "Zhi Commentary" are different, his blind attitude and method towards the "Zhi Commentary" have developed to a more extreme level. Zhou Ruchang said that his "only purpose is to use scientific methods to use historical materials to prove the correctness of the realistic autobiographical theory," and to prove that Dream of the Red Chamber "is a finely tailored record of real life" ("New Evidence": 566, 570). The historical material basis of the main conclusions of his "New Evidence for Dream of the Red Chamber" is the "Zhi Commentary," and he believes that the "Zhi Commentary" itself can solve all problems, even reaching the point of superstition. The "New Redology School" verbally flaunts "scientific methods" and respects the "Zhi Commentary" as historical material, but in reality, they not only use the "Zhi Commentary" to distort Dream of the Red Chamber, but also distort the meaning and value of the historical material itself.

The "Zhi Commentary" directly relates to the content and creative methods of Dream of the Red Chamber in many places, and it has a certain meaning and role in the study of Dream of the Red Chamber. However, it must first be liberated from the chaotic atmosphere created by the "New Redology School" before its value can be truly recognized.

The "Zhi Commentary" was not annotated by one person. Some are unsigned, and some are signed. These signatures are: Zhiyan Zhai, Qichou Sou, Meixi, Songzhai, Lisongxuan, Qiyuan, Jiantang, Yulanpo, and others. The views of the "Zhi Commentary" are not completely unified, and some even contradict each other. The most annotations are by Zhiyan Zhai and Qichou Sou, who were contemporaries of Cao Xueqin. As for who they were, we can ignore it for the time being.

The basic view of the "Zhi Commentary" on the content of Dream of the Red Chamber is the two words "emptiness" and "illusion." The commentary in the Gengchen version of the forty-eighth chapter regarding Xiangling's poetry prominently expresses this nihilistic view: "The beginning of a great book is a dream, Baoyu's love is a dream, Jiarui's lust is also a dream, Qin's family planning strategy is also a dream, now writing poetry is also a dream, and the Fengyue Jian is also from the dream, so is the Dream of the Red Chamber. I (originally the character '奈', mistaken) am now criticizing in a dream, especially to make this big dream for the people in the dream." Therefore, the commentator attributes the specific details in the book to "all using illusion," "this is an illusion," "pointing to the word 'illusion'," "also pointing to the word 'illusion'," "already entering the realm of illusion," that is, "the so-called seeing all realms as dream realms." The view of the "Zhi Commentary" is a purely nihilistic view of life and the world of the declining class, full of helpless pessimism towards real life. The view of the "Zhi Commentary" is intertwined with the backward fatalistic nihilistic view in Dream of the Red Chamber. It is a fact that there are some fatalistic nihilistic views in Dream of the Red Chamber, and this particularly touched the commentator's emotions, causing strong resonance, and the commentator exaggerated the backward consciousness in Dream of the Red Chamber into the whole from his own subjective point of view. However, as a great realist writer, Cao Xueqin's dominant aspect of thought is progressive, and the keynote running through Dream of the Red Chamber is not the negation of life, but is filled with a passionate pursuit of a better life. It is this realistic attitude towards life that gives Dream of the Red Chamber great artistic power. However, the view of life and the world in the "Zhi Commentary" is completely backward and cannot and should not be equated with Cao Xueqin's view of life and the world. For this reason, when the commentator expresses his feelings through the commentary on the language and actions of the characters in the book, his views often run counter to the way Dream of the Red Chamber handles the characters. The "Zhi Commentary" looks at the characters with abstract human nature, regarding Jia Baoyu's rebellious character as an unusual human nature that is contrary to common sense, and Jia Baoyu's thoughts and behaviors of sympathizing with women are understood as a manifestation of the character of "infatuation" and "lover," completely negating his progressive significance. On the contrary, Xue Baochai has received great praise, the so-called character of "being open-minded and going with the flow," "looking closely at each chapter, Baochai treats people and things without being alienated or intimate, not far or near, and has never seen a cold attitude shown to hateful people, nor has seen a sweet attitude shown to lovable people," regarding Xue Baochai's hypocritical worldly character formed under the influence of ethics as "being upright, solemn and inviolable," and degrading Lin Daiyu in comparison. The "Zhi Commentary" also greatly praises Wang Xifeng's hypocritical character, calling Xiren a "virtuous woman," and when the author exposedly describes Xiren, the commentator issued flattering words of protection: "Insulting my Xiqing." It can be seen that the "Zhi Commentary" holds a decadent nihilistic view of the entire life and the content of Dream of the Red Chamber, everything is "empty" and "illusory," and when observing specific people and specific things, it completely and clearly expresses the commentator's feudal orthodox concepts. The simultaneous occurrence of this phenomenon in the "Zhi Commentary" is not contradictory, but rather two aspects of the ideological consciousness of the declining feudal aristocratic class. Therefore, if the "Zhi Commentary" is completely used as the basis to explain Cao Xueqin and the ideological viewpoints of Dream of the Red Chamber, it will inevitably lead to wrong conclusions. The "New Redology School" is precisely taking this path.

The "Zhi Commentary" occupies a relatively large space with formalistic views on the artistic creation of Dream of the Red Chamber, sometimes senselessly isolating a word or phrase from the entire artistic image as the object of deliberation. When Dream of the Red Chamber describes Wang Xifeng's conspiracy to cruelly kill Jia Rui, the words "dispatching troops and assigning generals" are used, and the "Zhi Commentary" praises it endlessly, saying: "The four words are used in a new way, and there must be new and good-looking writing." There is a sentence "paper and pen are readily available" in the book, and the commentary says: "Two words, wonderful." There is a place in the book that uses three "again" characters, and the commentary says: "Using three 'again' characters in a row, and the word 'in every way' in the previous text, the divine meaning is vividly revealed." Such praise not only fails to explain the artistic characteristics, but also dilutes the emotions of love and hatred that the important plots should arouse in the readers, causing them to only pay attention to the words themselves. At the same time, the "Zhi Commentary" regards the entire artistic structure of Dream of the Red Chamber as a great article and talks about the composition and writing style, using some inexplicable "one strike two sounds method," "layered mountains and overlapping greenery method," "golden needle secret crossing method," "mountain broken cloud connected method," "inverted curtain method," "willows hiding parrots, the language is only known method," and dozens of other "methods" to analyze the artistic characteristics of Dream of the Red Chamber, completely vulgarizing the artistic structure of Dream of the Red Chamber. In the forty-sixth chapter of the Gengchen version, there is a commentary note like this: "True mirror flower, moon in the water, leopard in the clouds, bird in the forest, mouse in the hole, countless can be examined, no one can point, traces can be traced, shapes can be based on, nine twists and eight folds, distant sounds and near shadows, blurred smoke and heat, vertical and horizontal hidden appearance, thousands of strange things, dazzling and moving spirit, the great game method of a thousand hands and a thousand eyes is now also." In reality, the author only simply explained the names of a few people here, but the commentator shook his head and blew around without limit. Although the commentator praised "great composition," "great hand," "divine writing and strange writing," everything is reduced to jokes and game writing after this criticism, and is far away from the ideological content of the work. According to the commentator's understanding, the artistic structure of Dream of the Red Chamber is not the result of the author's processing and creation according to the logical laws of life, but is the result of subjective artificial insertion and arrangement. Abstracting the foundation of real life and hanging the artistic form in the air, the author's genius becomes an incomprehensible and mysterious plaything. The "Zhi Commentary's" formalism of treating novels as articles and talking about composition and writing style has its origins, especially inheriting the legacy of Jin Shengtan's commentary on Water Margin, because the commentator admired Jin Shengtan's "talent" for annotating books. For example, in the thirtyth chapter of the Jia Chen version, a commentary note says, "Writing about the infinite feelings of Baodai, if Shengtan saw it, I don't know how many wonderful things he would criticize." In the fifty-fourth chapter of the Youzheng version, it says, "Alas, the author has passed away, Shengtan has died, I don't understand myself, and I intend to say a few words, know me and blame me, listen to it." Such commentary distorts the content and form of the work, diverts the reader's attention, and gets lost in the "illusory realm" of talking about composition. Such commentary also left gaps for the formalistic and tedious textual research of the "New Redology School." The various wrong conclusions and speculations made by Yu Pingbo on Dream of the Red Chamber itself are mostly based on the "Zhi Commentary." Zhou Ruchang's horn-drilling "New Hidden Meaning" is also the same. They are all "in the same vein" as the erroneous views of the "Zhi Commentary."

The first step in pointing out the errors of the "Zhi Commentary" is to allow readers who now have the opportunity to access the "Zhi Commentary" to view it objectively, so as not to be misled into the maze set up by the "New Redology School" again. However, this does not mean that the "Zhi Commentary" has no meaning or role in the study of Dream of the Red Chamber.

The "Zhi Commentary" does point out some valuable materials and clues for studying Cao Xueqin's life and thoughts and the content of Dream of the Red Chamber. The "Zhi Commentary" points out the prototypes of the characters in the book and the factual basis of some detailed descriptions. The "Zhi Commentary" often comments, "There is this matter, there is this person," "The author and I have really experienced it!" "I also heard this personally, it is not compiled," "Does the author still remember brewing wine with Hehuan flowers in front of the Aiqiao Fang? It has been twenty years!" However, due to different viewpoints and methods, the nature of the conclusions drawn is fundamentally different. Starting from this, the "New Redology School" insisted that Dream of the Red Chamber is a "plain and unremarkable naturalistic" work, is an "autobiography," and is a "finely tailored record of real life," reducing the typical of literature to the truth of fact. However, from the point of view of realist literary criticism, the conclusion is just the opposite. It is right to say that some of the characters and events in Dream of the Red Chamber have a factual basis based on the "Zhi Commentary." However, simply relying on the accumulation of facts still cannot become a literary work. When these factual bases are cast in a complete and unified artistic image, they lose their original appearance. In the process of processing and refining the material, the author discards the non-essential things and raises, concentrates and generalizes it into a typical that contains a broader social content. This is the law of realist creation, and Dream of the Red Chamber is of course no exception. At the same time, according to the "Zhi Commentary," we can further understand that the creation of Dream of the Red Chamber has a rich foundation in real life, and placing the foundation of creation on real life makes Dream of the Red Chamber gain higher artistic truth. If you only see the material and not the image built on the basis of the material, and reduce the typical image to the material, it is an anti-realist and anti-scientific method. It is necessary to point this out, because Hu Shi's research method still influences the study of some classical masterpieces. For example, Yao Xueyin analyzed Scholars based on Jin He's "Preface," "proving" that Du Shaoqing in the book is the author Wu Jingzi; Wang Jisi studied Tang Legend The Story of Yingying, believing that Zhang Sheng in the work is a portrayal of the author Yuan Zhen, and there are many examples of this kind. If it is still excusable that the previous "Zhiyan Zhai," Jin He, etc. could not correctly understand literary creation and confused the truth of fact with the truth of art, then it is deliberately distorting the social meaning and social value of literary works if researchers still use the eyes of "Zhiyan Zhai" and Jin He to view Dream of the Red Chamber and Scholars today.

In the "Zhi Commentary," there are many places that provide some clues for the later eighty chapters, such as the comment "Fu Yuanfei's Death" in the eighteenth chapter, the comment "Supplementing Baoyu's spoiledness since childhood. Use this sentence to compare with the 'eating sour pickles in the cold winter, and surrounding broken felt on snowy nights' in the lower dozens of chapters" in the nineteenth chapter, the comment "Tan Chun's distant marriage" and "Xichun becoming a nun" in the twenty-second chapter, and the comment that Baoyu finally "let go on the edge of the cliff" in the twenty-fifth chapter. According to these clues, it can be roughly inferred the ending of Dream of the Red Chamber and the objective trend of the development of the main characters' personalities, further helping to understand the content of Dream of the Red Chamber. At the same time, the last forty chapters of the continuation book can be appropriately evaluated, and one should not, like Yu Pingbo and Zhou Ruchang, use this as a basis to scold Gao E severely, and even have the hatred of "not being of the same China."

Dream of the Red Chamber has been distorted into a novel like the general talented scholar and beautiful woman style works that promote vulgar feudal viewpoints. However, the "Zhi Commentary" especially opposes those formulaic talented scholar and beautiful woman style works, and greatly praises Dream of the Red Chamber, pointing out everywhere that it is different from those talented scholar and beautiful woman style works, believing that it has outstanding originality, and trying to prove Cao Xueqin's views on his own creation announced at the beginning of the book through commentary notes. At that time, and even for a considerable period of time thereafter, it was still a unique view of Dream of the Red Chamber. Although the "Zhi Commentary's" praise for Dream of the Red Chamber is mostly entangled in "composition" and "writing style," it points out Cao Xueqin's artistic achievements in the arrangement of the plot and the handling of the characters compared with the vulgar talented scholar and beautiful woman style works. Through the various attacks on those bad talented scholar and beautiful woman style novels in the "Zhi Commentary," the artistic value of Dream of the Red Chamber can indeed be understood to a certain extent, that is, breaking away from the influence of the inherited and outdated expression methods and exerting originality. At the same time, we can also see the dominant power and bad influence of the talented scholar and beautiful woman style works that served the ruling class at that time, and the great significance of Dream of the Red Chamber appearing under this situation is even more obvious.

The "Zhi Commentary" is quite complex, and it is necessary to find the meaningful things in it under the guidance of correct viewpoints and methods. If you blindly believe in the "Zhi Commentary" and try to solve the fundamental problems of studying Dream of the Red Chamber with the commentary itself, you will inevitably make mistakes. The harmful research path taken by the "New Redology School" can be used as a warning.

    正确估价红楼梦中“脂砚斋评”的意义
    李希凡  蓝翎
    “脂砚斋重评石头记”出版了，“新红学派”的“底”也就揭开了。
    中国的古典文学名著常有某某人的评注本。评注者在作品中加上自己的评注，表明对这部作品的看法。从广泛的意义来讲，这种评注也可以说是一种文艺批评。在研究古典文学名著的时候，对这些评注应该加以必要的研究，应该用科学的观点来对它们作适当的评价。尽管有些评注者的观点可能是很反动的，如金圣叹的批改水浒，但也同样可以从中了解历史上不同阶级对同一作品不同的看法，帮助进一步探讨这一作品的社会意义以及它在历史上所引起的反响。因此，在研究红楼梦的时候，也同样应该用这样的态度去对待其中的“脂砚斋评”。
    利用古人对作品的评注本来是很平常的事。但是，由于研究者观点的不同，因而就产生了完全不同的态度。“五四”以来的胡适派往往把什么“孤本”评注看作解决一切问题的法宝，这在红楼梦的研究中表现的更突出明显。自从几个脂砚斋评本的红楼梦发现以后，“脂评”就被“新红学派”奉为至高无上的法宝，弄得乌烟瘴气，简直神秘的很。
    “新红学派”是怎样看待“脂评”的呢？胡适在他的“红楼梦考证”里就把红楼梦歪曲成“平淡无奇的自然主义”作品。脂评本红楼梦发现以后，他又利用“脂评”进一步加强了他的反动结论，认为“此等处皆可助证红楼梦为记述曹家事实之书，可以摧破不少的怀疑”，“故红楼梦是写曹家的事，这一点现在得了许多新证据，更是颠扑不破的了”。（胡适文存三集：五七三、五七五页）。俞平伯的所谓“自传说”、“色空观念”、“传统性”等等都是以“脂评”作“根据”的。周汝昌在“红楼梦新证”中仍然没有跳出“新红学派”的泥坑，虽然对“脂评”中的个别问题的看法不同，但对待“脂评”的盲目态度和方法却是发展得更加极端化了。周汝昌说自己“唯一目的即在以科学的方法运用历史材料证明写实自传说之不误”，证明红楼梦“是精裁细剪的生活实录”（“新证”：五六六、五七○页）。他的“红楼梦新证”，主要结论的历史材料的根据就是“脂评”，认为“脂评”本身就可以解决一切问题，甚至达到了迷信的程度。“新红学派”口头上标榜什么“科学方法”，尊重作为历史材料的“脂评”，实际上他们不仅用“脂评”来歪曲红楼梦，而且把历史材料本身的意义和价值也歪曲了。
    在“脂评”中有不少地方直接关涉着红楼梦的内容和创作方法，它在红楼梦的研究中有着一定的意义和作用。但是，必须首先把它从“新红学派”所制造的乌烟瘴气中解放出来，才可能真正认识它的价值。
    “脂评”不是一个人批注的。有些是没有署名的，有些是有署名的。这些署名是：脂砚斋、畸笏叟、梅溪、松斋、立松轩、绮园、鉴堂、玉蓝坡等人。“脂评”的见解也不完全统一，有的则互相矛盾。批注最多的是脂砚斋和畸笏叟，是曹雪芹同时代的人。至于究竟是谁，可以暂且不管它。
    “脂评”对红楼梦内容的基本看法是“虚”“幻”二字。庚辰本第四十八回关于香菱作诗的批语突出地表现了这种虚无主义的观点，“一部大书起是梦，宝玉情是梦，贾瑞淫又是梦，秦之家计长策又是梦，今作诗也是梦，一并风月鉴亦从梦中所有，故红楼梦也。余（原作奈字，误）今批评亦在梦中，特为梦中之人特作此一大梦也。”因此，评者把书中具体的细节描写也都归结到“全用幻”、“此是幻像”、“点幻字”、“又点幻字”、“已入幻境”，即“所谓万境都如梦境看也”。“脂评”的观点是纯粹的没落阶级的虚无主义的人生观和世界观，对于现实人生的看法充满着无可奈何的悲观情调。“脂评”的观点是和红楼梦中落后的宿命论的虚无主义观点互相纠缠在一起的。红楼梦中有部分的宿命论的虚无主义观点是事实，这也特别打动了评注者的情感，引起了强烈的共鸣，而评注者又从自己的主观出发将红楼梦中落后的意识夸大为全体。但是，作为现实主义伟大作家的曹雪芹，他的思想的主导方面是进步的，贯串在红楼梦中的基调不是对人生的否定，而是洋溢着对美好人生的热烈追求，正是这种现实主义的对待人生的态度，才给予了红楼梦伟大的艺术力量。而“脂评”中的人生观和世界观却完全是落后的，是无法而且也不应该与曹雪芹的人生观和世界观等量齐观的。正因如此，评者在通过对书中人物的语言行动的评注而抒发自己感慨的时候，其见解往往是和红楼梦对人物的处理背道而驰。“脂评”是用抽象的人性来看待人物形象的，把贾宝玉的叛逆性格看成是反乎常情的奇怪的人性，贾宝玉同情妇女的思想行为被理解为“情痴”和“情种”的性格流露，根本否定了他的进步意义。相反的，薛宝钗却受到了大力的歌颂和赞扬，即所谓“行为豁达，随分随时”的性格，“逐回细看，宝卿待人接物不疏不亲，不远不近，可厌之人亦未见冷淡之态形诸声色，可喜之人亦未见醴蜜之情形诸声色”，把薛宝钗在礼教的薰陶下所形成的虚伪的世俗的性格，看成为“行止端肃恭严，不可侵犯”，并且在对比之下贬低林黛玉。“脂评”还大加赞扬王熙凤的虚伪性格，称袭人为“贤女子”，而在作者暴露地描写袭人的时候，评者则肉麻地发出了袒护之言：“唐突我袭卿”。由此可以看出，“脂评”在对待整个的人生和红楼梦的内容是没落的虚无主义的观点，一切是“虚”，是“幻”，而在观察到具体的人和具体的事情的时候，则又完全明确地表现出评者的封建主义的正统观念。这种现象同时出现在“脂评”中是不矛盾的，而是没落的封建贵族阶级思想意识的两个方面。因此，如果完全以“脂评”作为根据去解释曹雪芹和红楼梦的思想观点，必然会引导到错误的结论上去，“新红学派”正是走的这条道路。
    “脂评”中占篇幅较多的是对红楼梦的艺术创造的形式主义的见解，有时是毫无意义地从整个艺术形象中孤立地割裂出一字一句作为推敲的对象。红楼梦中描写到王熙凤阴谋残酷地害死贾瑞的时候，用了“点兵派将”四字，“脂评”就赞不绝口地说：“四字用得新，必有新文字好看”。书中有一句“纸笔现成”，评语则曰：“二字，妙。”书中有一处用了三个又字，评语则曰：“连用三‘又’字，上文一个‘百般’，神理活现。”这样的吹捧不仅不能说出艺术上的特点，而且把那些很重要的情节应该在读者中引起的爱憎情绪冲淡了，使之只去注意文字的本身。同时，“脂评”也把整个的红楼梦的艺术结构看成一篇大文章而大谈章法和笔法，用了一些莫明其妙的什么“一击两鸣法”、“层峦叠翠法”、“金针暗度法”、“山断云连法”、“倒卷帘法”、“柳藏鹦鹉语方知之法”等等不下数十种的“法”来分析红楼梦的艺术特点，把红楼梦的艺术结构完全庸俗化了。庚辰本第四十六回有这样一条批注：“真镜中花，水中月，云中豹，林中之鸟，穴中之鼠，无数可考，无人可指，有迹可追，有形可据，九曲八折，远响近影，迷离烟灼，纵横隐现，千奇百怪，眩目移神，现千手千眼大游戏法也。”实际上作者只不过在这里简单地交待了几个人名字而已，而评者却摇头晃脑漫无边际地乱吹一通。评者虽然啧啧称赞什么“大章法”、“大手笔”、“神文奇文”，但经这一批，一切都化为笑谈和游戏文字，而远远地离开了作品中的思想内容。依照评者的理解，红楼梦的艺术结构不是作者按照生活的逻辑规律进行加工创造的结果，而是出于主观的人工的穿插安排。抽去了现实生活的基础，把艺术形式悬到空中去，因而作者的天才也就成为不可理解的神秘的玩艺了。“脂评”这种把小说当文章而形式主义地大谈章法和笔法的评注是有渊源的，特别是继承了金圣叹评点水浒的遗风，因为评者是很佩服金圣叹批书的“才能”的。如甲辰本第三十回中一条批语说，“写尽宝黛无限心曲，假使圣叹见之，正不知批出多少妙处。”有正本第五十四回批道，“噫，作者已逝，圣叹云亡，愚不自谅，辄拟数语，知我罪我，其听之矣。”这样的批注曲解了作品的内容和形式，转移了读者的注意力，迷入大谈章法的“太虚幻境”中。这样的批注也给“新红学派”的形式主义的繁琐考证留下了空隙。俞平伯对红楼梦本身所作的种种错误的结论、推测，绝大部分是以“脂评”作根据的。周汝昌的钻牛角尖的“新索隐”也是如此。他们都和“脂评”的错误观点是“一脉相传”的。
    首先指出“脂评”的错误，是为了使现在有机会接触到“脂评”的读者能客观地去看待它，不致再误入“新红学派”所布下的迷阵。但是，这并不等于说“脂评”对于研究红楼梦毫无意义和作用。
    “脂评”的确指出了一些可贵的研究曹雪芹的身世思想和红楼梦的内容的材料和线索。“脂评”指出了书中人物的原型和一些细节描写的事实根据。“脂评”常批道，“有是事，有是人”，“作者与余，实实经过！”“此语余亦亲闻，非编有也”，“作者犹记矮?舫前以合欢花酿酒乎？屈指二十年矣！”等等。但是，对于这些材料，由于观点和方法的不同，因而所作出的结论的性质就有根本的纷歧。“新红学派”从此出发，一口咬定红楼梦是“平淡无奇的自然主义”作品，是“自传”，是“精裁细剪的生活实录”，把文学的典型还原为事实的真实。但是，从现实主义文学批评的观点来看，结论就恰恰相反。根据“脂评”说红楼梦中的一些人物、事件有事实的根据是对的。然而，如果仅仅依靠着事实的堆积还是不能成为文学作品的。当这些事实的根据被熔铸在完整的统一的艺术形象中以后，就失去了它原来的样子。作者在对素材进行加工提炼的过程中摒弃了非本质的东西，把它提高集中概括为包含着更深广的社会内容的典型。这是现实主义创作的规律，红楼梦当然不例外。同时，根据“脂评”也可以进一步了解红楼梦的创作有着丰富的现实生活的基础，把创作的根基立在现实生活的基础上，就使得红楼梦获得了更高的艺术的真实性。如果只看到素材，看不到在素材的基础上塑造起来的形象，把典型形象还原为素材，就是反现实主义反科学的方法。指出这一点是必要的，因为胡适派的研究方法仍然影响着对一些古典名著的研究。例如姚雪垠分析儒林外史，就以金和的“跋”为根据，“证明”书中的杜少卿就是作者吴敬梓；王季思研究到唐传奇会真记，认为作品中的张生就是作者元稹的写照，凡此种种，例子是很多的。如果说以前的“脂砚斋”、金和等不能正确地理解文学创作、将事实的真实和艺术的真实混为一谈的作法还情有可原，那末在今天研究者们仍然用“脂砚斋”、金和的眼光来看待红楼梦和儒林外史等，就是有意地歪曲文学作品的社会意义和社会价值了。
    在“脂评”中，有不少地方提供了八十回后的一些线索，如第十八回“伏元妃之死”的批，第十九回“补明宝玉自幼何等娇贵。以此一句留与下部后数十回‘寒冬噎酸齑，雪夜围破毡’等处对看”的批语，第二十二回“探春远适”“惜春为尼”的批语，第二十五回宝玉终于“悬崖撒手”的批语等等。根据这些线索，大体上可以推断红楼梦的结局及主要人物性格发展的客观趋势，进一步帮助了解红楼梦的内容。同时，也可以适当地评价后四十回的续书，而不应该像俞平伯、周汝昌那样以此为根据而痛骂高鹗，甚至有“不与同中国也”的仇恨。
    红楼梦曾被歪曲为与一般宣扬庸俗的封建观点的才子佳人式的作品一样的小说。但是，“脂评”却特别反对那些公式化了的才子佳人式的作品，对红楼梦则大加赞扬，处处指出它与那些才子佳人式的作品不同，认为它有卓越的独创性，企图通过批注来证实曹雪芹在书的开头所宣布的他对于自己创作的见解。这在当时，甚至在以后一个相当的时间内，都不失其为对红楼梦的独到之见。尽管“脂评”对红楼梦的推崇很多纠缠在“章法”“笔法”上，但在与庸俗的才子佳人式的作品比照之下，却指出了曹雪芹对红楼梦故事情节的安排，人物性格的处理上的艺术成就。透过“脂评”中对那些不好的才子佳人式的小说的种种攻击，确实可以在一定程度上了解红楼梦的艺术价值，即摆脱了因袭的陈旧的表现方法的影响而发挥了独创性。同时，也看到当时为统治阶级服务的才子佳人式的作品的统治势力和坏影响，而红楼梦出现在这种情况之下，就更显出了它伟大的意义。
    “脂评”是相当庞杂的，必须在正确的观点和方法的指导下去寻找其中有意义的东西。如果过分迷信“脂评”，企图用评语本身去解决研究红楼梦的根本问题，那就非犯错误不可，“新红学派”所走的坑害人的研究道路是可以作为前车之鉴的。
