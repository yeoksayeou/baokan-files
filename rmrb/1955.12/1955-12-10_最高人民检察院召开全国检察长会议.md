Xinhua News Agency report:

    The National Conference of Chief Procurators of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, convened by the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China on November 25th, concluded on December 7th.

    The conference believes that procuratorial work has further developed since the beginning of this year, especially in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, where procuratorial work has played an active role. First, people's procuratorates at all levels have actively and fully undertaken the work of reviewing and approving the arrest of criminals, basically completing the task of legally ensuring the timely arrest of counter-revolutionaries and other criminals of all kinds, and protecting the democratic rights of the people. Second, procuratorial organs at all levels have also actively carried out the work of reviewing and prosecuting cases and have focused on investigating important criminal cases, cracking down on various criminals. Furthermore, by inspecting prisons and labor reform teams, some problems in supervising and reforming criminals through labor were resolved. During this period of the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, the organizational and professional development of procuratorial organs in various localities has also progressed.

    The conference studied the current tasks of procuratorial work. The conference believes that in the in-depth struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, procuratorial organs at all levels should fully undertake the work of reviewing and prosecuting cases, and should continue to strengthen and improve the work of reviewing and approving the arrest of criminals. In the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, procuratorial organs at all levels should also continue to strengthen organizational and professional development. In terms of organizational development, first of all, people's procuratorates at all levels, as well as railway and waterway transportation procuratorates, that have not yet been established should be established quickly. It is required to complete the personnel allocation tasks in the 1955 temporary staffing of people's procuratorates at all levels this year, establish military procuratorates at all levels as soon as possible, and further purify and consolidate the organization of procuratorial organs. In terms of professional development, it is necessary to clearly establish the idea of ​​carrying out professional development in conjunction with various mass movements to implement the Organic Law of the People's Procuratorate, so that the development of procuratorial work can quickly catch up with and adapt to the needs of the socialist revolution situation, and effectively ensure the smooth progress of the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation from the perspective of procuratorial work.

    The conference also discussed how procuratorial work can guarantee the smooth development of the agricultural cooperativization movement. The conference believes that in the face of the high tide of the rural socialist revolution movement, people's procuratorates at all levels must act actively and regard guaranteeing the agricultural cooperativization movement as an urgent political task at present.

    The conference put forward a preliminary plan for procuratorial work in 1956.

    会议认为，今年以来，检察工作有了进一步的发展，特别是在肃清反革命分子的斗争中，检察工作发挥了积极的作用。首先，各级人民检察机关积极地、全部地担负了审查批准逮捕人犯的工作，基本上完成了从法律上保证把应当逮捕的反革命分子和其他各种犯罪分子及时逮捕起来的任务，保护了人民的民主权利。其次，各级检察机关还积极地进行了审查起诉的工作和有重点地进行了重要刑事案件的侦查工作，打击了各种犯罪分子，并且通过检查监所、劳动改造队的工作，解决了在监管罪犯和对罪犯进行劳动改造中的一些问题。在这一时期的肃清反革命分子的斗争中，各地检察机关的组织建设和业务建设都有了发展。
    会议研究了检察工作当前的任务。会议认为，各级检察机关在深入开展肃清反革命分子的斗争中，应当把审查起诉工作全部担负起来，并且要继续加强和改进审查批准逮捕人犯的工作。在肃清反革命分子的斗争中，各级检察机关还要继续加强组织建设和业务建设。在组织建设方面，首先应当把还没有建立的地方各级人民检察院和铁路、水上运输检察院迅速地建立起来，要求在今年内完成各级人民检察院一九五五年临时编制中的干部调配任务，尽快地建立各级军事检察院，并且进一步纯洁和巩固检察机关的组织。在业务建设方面，必须明确树立结合各项群众运动贯彻执行人民检察院组织法进行业务建设的思想，使检察业务的建设能够迅速赶上和适应社会主义革命形势的需要，从检察工作方面有效地保障国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。
    会议还讨论了检察工作如何保障农业合作化运动顺利发展的问题。会议认为，在农村社会主义革命运动的高潮面前，各级人民检察院必须积极地行动起来，把保障农业合作化运动作为当前迫切的政治任务。
    会议提出了一九五六年检察工作的初步规划。
