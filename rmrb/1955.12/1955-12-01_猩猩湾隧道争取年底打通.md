    Strive to Complete Xingxingwan Tunnel by the End of the Year
    Since entering winter, the construction of the Xingxingwan Tunnel, a key project of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, has become even more intense. More than 500 meters of the 800-plus meter long tunnel have already been excavated. Workers are striving to complete the entire tunnel by the end of this year. Currently, the temperature at the construction site is gradually decreasing, reaching minus two degrees Celsius at night, and workers are working day and night despite the severe cold. In order to accelerate the progress of the project, the workers have promoted many advanced working methods and adjusted the labor organization, which has significantly improved work efficiency.

    猩猩湾隧道争取年底打通
    入冬以来，包兰铁路重点工程——猩猩湾隧道工程，施工更加紧张。长达八百多公尺的隧道已经开挖了五百多公尺。工人们争取在今年年底打通全部隧道。目前，工地上的气温已日渐下降，夜间已达摄氏零下二度，工人们冒着严寒日夜不停地工作着。为了加速工程进度，工人们推广了许多先进工作方法，调整了劳动组织，工作效率已显著提高。
