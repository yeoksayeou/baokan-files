    Stop the Piratical Acts of the Syngman Rhee Clique Endangering Public Sea Safety

    On December 25th, a shocking act of piracy occurred on the high seas of the Yellow Sea between our country and Korea. Naval vessels of the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique, blatantly disregarding the right to fish in international waters, opened fire on our fishing boats, attempting to劫持[jié chí - hijack] them, and abducted two of our fishermen.

    The Yellow Sea high seas are a place where our fishermen frequently fish, and no one can deprive them of this legitimate right to make a living. The piratical behavior of the Syngman Rhee clique is clearly a deliberate provocation against our peaceful people, with the aim of disrupting peace in Asia and creating tension. This has aroused great indignation among all Chinese people and will surely be met with righteous condemnation from peace-loving people and fair-minded public opinion in all countries.

    Currently, the Syngman Rhee clique is spreading all sorts of lies through American news agencies, attempting to portray the location of the incident as being near the South Korean coast in order to deceive fair-minded world opinion and mitigate its responsibility. However, this is useless. The various justifications spread through American news agencies are so full of contradictions that they are even extremely absurd and laughable! The Associated Press said that the incident occurred near Incheon; the United Press said that it was near Jeju Island, and then again near Chodo Island. Anyone with even a little knowledge of Korean geography knows that Incheon is hundreds of kilometers away from Jeju Island! And Chodo Island is even north of the 38th parallel, within the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea! Such unfounded and casually fabricated lies cannot deceive anyone. The exact location where the Syngman Rhee clique provoked our fishing boats was on the high seas of the Yellow Sea at 34 degrees 15 minutes north latitude and 123 degrees 50 minutes east longitude. Another message from Seoul by the Associated Press on the 26th also admitted that the incident occurred in a location similar to the above.

    After committing such piratical crimes on the high seas, the Syngman Rhee clique shamelessly clamored, deliberately exaggerating the incident as an "act of war." They insisted that Chinese fishermen "invaded" South Korea, rather than the Syngman Rhee clique infringing upon the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese fishermen. However, the fact that two peaceful Chinese fishermen were abducted by the Syngman Rhee clique, while four armed bandits from South Korea were brought back by our fishermen, shows who infringed upon whose rights. Therefore, the Syngman Rhee clique must bear full responsibility for the provocation it launched, and should immediately release the two Chinese fishermen and ensure their safe return to their homeland.

    This is not the first time that the Syngman Rhee clique has engaged in piratical acts on the high seas. This year, it has continuously used South Korean fishing fleets to cover armed agents who invade the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, disrupting the peace and security of the people in northern Korea. In recent years, the Syngman Rhee clique has illegally hijacked a large number of Japanese fishing boats on the high seas, and more than six hundred Japanese fishermen are still being detained in South Korea. The piratical acts of the Syngman Rhee clique also threaten the survival rights of approximately 40,000 Japanese fishermen, placing their lives in extremely difficult circumstances.

    It is not difficult to see that the lawless piratical activities of the Syngman Rhee clique not only infringe upon the legitimate rights of Chinese fishermen but also damage the interests of fishermen from countries adjacent to South Korea. The Chinese people and the countries concerned cannot tolerate the Syngman Rhee clique continuing to engage in such piratical acts that endanger the safety of the high seas. They will resolutely defend the legitimate interests of fishermen from all countries and safeguard peace and security in Asia.

### 制止李承晚集团危害公海安全的海盗行为

    制止李承晚集团危害公海安全的海盗行为
    十二月二十五日，在我国和朝鲜之间的黄海公海上，发生了一桩令人愤慨的海盗行凶事件。南朝鲜李承晚集团的海军舰艇，公然不顾公海捕鱼的权利，向我国渔船开火射击，企图劫夺我国渔船；它并且掳走了我国两名渔民。
    黄海公海是我国渔民经常捕鱼的地方，任何人都不能剥夺他们这种赖以维持生活的正当权利。李承晚集团的海盗行为，显然是对我国和平人民的蓄意挑衅，目的是在扰乱亚洲的和平，引起紧张形势。这已经激起了全体中国人民的极大愤怒，也一定会遭到各国爱好和平人民和公正舆论的正义斥责。
    现在，李承晚集团正通过美国通讯社散布各种各样的谎言，企图把这次事件所发生的地点，说成是在南朝鲜海岸附近，以欺骗世界公正舆论，减轻它所应负的罪责。然而，这是没有用的。经过美国通讯社所散布出来的各种辩解，是那样矛盾百出，甚至达到极端荒谬可笑的地步！合众社说，事件发生是在仁川附近；美联社说，是在济州岛的附近，又说是在椒岛附近。稍微具有朝鲜地理知识的人都知道，仁川同济州岛相距何止几百公里！而椒岛更在北纬三十八度线以北、属于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领海之内！这种毫无事实根据而随便捏造出来的谎话，是欺骗不了任何人的。李承晚集团向我国渔船挑衅的确实地点，是在北纬三十四度十五分、东经一百二十三度五十分的黄海公海上。美联社二十六日从汉城发出的另一条消息，也承认事件发生是在和上述地点相近似的地方。
    李承晚集团在公海上干下这种海盗罪行以后，居然不顾羞耻地大叫大嚷，故意把这个事件渲染成“战争行动”。硬说是中国渔民“侵略”了南朝鲜，而不是李承晚集团侵犯了中国渔民的正当权益。但是，事实说明，被李承晚集团掳走的是中国两名和平渔民，而被我国渔民带回的却是南朝鲜的四名武装匪徒，这就可以看出究竟是谁侵犯了谁的权利。因此，李承晚集团应对它发动的挑衅负全部责任，并且应该立即释放中国的两名渔民，保障他们安全地返回自己的祖国。
    李承晚集团在公海上进行海盗行为，这不是第一次。在今年就曾不断利用南朝鲜渔民的船队掩护武装特务侵犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领海，破坏朝鲜北部人民的和平和安全。几年来，李承晚集团在公海上非法劫夺了大批日本渔船，至今仍有六百多个日本渔民被扣留在南朝鲜。李承晚集团的海盗行为，还威胁着约四万日本渔民的生存权利，使他们的生活陷于极端困难的境地。
    不难看出，李承晚集团这种无法无天的海盗勾当，不仅侵犯了中国渔民的正当权利，而且损害了和南朝鲜相邻的各国渔民的利益。中国人民和与此有关的各国，决不能容忍李承晚集团继续进行这种危害公海安全的海盗行为。他们将坚决地维护各国渔民的正当利益，并保障亚洲的和平和安全。
