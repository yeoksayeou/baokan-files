　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 17th: According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the morning of December 15th, attended by representatives of eleven newly admitted countries (their former permanent observers to the United Nations or diplomatic personnel stationed in the United States). The representative of Hungary was Károly Szarka, and the representative of Romania was Constantin Dimitrachescu. Representatives of Albania, Bulgaria, Nepal, Cambodia, and Laos were unable to reach the United States in time to attend the meeting.

　　At the plenary session, the vast majority of speakers expressed satisfaction that the deadlock on the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations, which had lasted for many years, had been broken. In this regard, several representatives emphasized the special role of the Soviet delegation in proposing the admission of sixteen countries. Iraqi representative Jamali said: "Special mention should be made of the merit of the Soviet delegation, whose actions yesterday led to such a happy result."

　　The remarks made by the Chiang Kai-shek elements aroused public indignation. He said he regretted not having exercised his veto power over all the people's democracies admitted to the United Nations.

　　Indian representative Menon and other representatives drew the attention of the General Assembly to the fact that the Chiang Kai-shek elements' veto prevented the full realization of the General Assembly's wish to admit eighteen countries. The Mongolian People's Republic and Japan, two Asian countries, were not admitted to the United Nations, and the decision to admit the other sixteen countries was almost undermined. Menon said that the General Assembly should draw the necessary conclusions from this and ensure that the representation in the United Nations reflects the true situation of the world.

　　At this plenary session, some recommendations of the General Assembly committees were also adopted.

    十一个新会员国出席联大全会
    新华社十七日讯　据塔斯社纽约十七日讯：联合国大会十二月十五日上午举行了全体会议，有十一个新近被接纳的国家的代表（它们以前的常驻联合国观察员或驻美国的外交人员）出席了会议。匈牙利的代表是卡罗伊·萨尔卡，罗马尼亚的代表是康斯坦丁·季米特拉凯斯库。阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、尼泊尔、柬埔寨和老挝的代表未及赶到美国参加会议。
    在全体会议上，绝大多数发言人对打开多年来在联合国接纳新会员国问题的僵局表示满意。在这方面，若干代表着重指出了提出接纳十六个国家的建议的苏联代表团的特别作用。伊拉克代表贾马利说：“应当特别指出苏联代表团的功绩，是它在昨天采取的措施导致了这样愉快的结果”。
    蒋介石分子的发言引起了公愤，他说，他懊悔没有对被联合国接纳的所有人民民主国家都行使否决权。
    印度代表梅农和其他一些代表提请大会注意，由于蒋介石分子投否决票，使大会接纳十八个国家的意愿没有完全实现，蒙古人民共和国和日本两个亚洲国家没有被接纳加入联合国，而接纳另外十六个国家的决定也险些遭到破坏。梅农说，大会应该由此得出应有的结论，使联合国的代表席位反映出世界的真实情况。
    在这次全体会议上，还通过了大会各委员会的一些建议。
