Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 15th: Since the beginning of autumn, Liaoning Province has established and is in the process of establishing 10,600 agricultural producers' cooperatives, with a total of 323,000 peasant households joining. Including the original members of the old cooperatives and the new members admitted in the autumn, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has reached 66.6% of the total number of households in the province. According to the provincial cooperative planning, by the end of December this year, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives will reach 75% of the total number of households in the province, and the province will basically achieve semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. At present, all counties in the province have generally started to pilot advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives. It is expected that before the spring ploughing next year, the number of advanced cooperatives in the province will increase from 21 before this autumn to 300 to 400.

Xinhua News Agency: The Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has determined that Gansu Province will basically achieve semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization this winter and next spring.

Gansu Province has now built more than 27,900 new cooperatives. Together with the original old cooperatives, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has reached 55% of the total number of peasant households. Twelve counties (cities) in the province have basically achieved cooperativization. Party organizations at all levels have also gained experience in leading peasants to establish cooperatives. In particular, county and district cadres have mostly learned the working methods of the mass line. Therefore, before the spring ploughing next year, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province can be developed to more than 45,000, and the number of peasant households joining cooperatives will reach about 80% of the total number of peasant households.

People's Daily, Hefei, December 15th: Anhui Province's agricultural producers' cooperatives have now developed to more than 120,000, and the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has reached more than 60% of the total number of households in the province. Next spring, the number of peasant households participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives can reach 80% of the total number of households, and the province will basically achieve semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization.

After studying Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" and the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, cadres at all levels in Anhui Province criticized right-leaning conservative ideas and actively led the work of developing agricultural cooperatives. The province has trained a total of more than 200,000 backbones for running cooperatives, and at the same time transferred more than 10,000 cadres to specifically lead the work of running cooperatives. In the process of building cooperatives, all localities have given full play to the role of old cooperatives. In Lingbi, Suxian, and Dangshan counties, there are more than 1,600 cadres from old cooperatives who have helped the masses establish more than 1,500 new cooperatives. This autumn and winter, many areas in Anhui Province suffered severe drought. In the process of building and expanding cooperatives, these areas paid attention to combining drought resistance and production work. Many agricultural producers' cooperatives have initially shown the superiority of cooperativization.

People's Daily, Wuhan, December 15th: Before October next year, Hubei Province can basically achieve semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. At present, there are already more than 93,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province, and the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has reached 45% of the total number of peasant households in the province.

In the past two or three months, a total of 79,000 new cooperatives have been established in the province. At present, the focus of work in most areas has shifted to rectifying new cooperatives. These newly built agricultural producers' cooperatives have generally stepped up winter production. The winter sowing progress of new cooperatives in various places is generally 20% faster than that of individual farmers. The more than 16,000 agricultural cooperatives newly built in Xiangyang Prefecture have completed more than 90% of their winter sowing plans.
