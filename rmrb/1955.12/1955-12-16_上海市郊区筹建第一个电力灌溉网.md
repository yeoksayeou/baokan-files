Shanghai Suburbs to Build First Electrical Irrigation Network

    The Shanghai suburbs have begun preparations to build the first large-scale electrical irrigation network. This is an important part of the agricultural technology reform plan for the Shanghai suburbs.

    The irrigation network will cover more than 100,000 mu of arable land. All the land will be divided into 105 grassroots irrigation areas. It is planned to install 95 ten-horsepower electric water pumps and 10 artificial rainfall devices in each irrigation area. After the project is completed and put into production before June of next year, it will ensure that these 100,000 mu of farmland will no longer be threatened by drought, and vegetable production will increase by 1 million to 1.5 million dan per year. Farmers' incomes will also increase year by year.

    According to preliminary estimates, this project requires laying 35,000 meters of power lines, building more than 100 machine rooms, constructing 600 to 700 water conveyance canals, and excavating and filling approximately 380,000 cubic meters of earthwork. The total project investment is approximately 1.8 million yuan. (Our correspondent in Shanghai)

    上海市郊区筹建第一个电力灌溉网
    上海市郊区开始筹备建设第一个规模庞大的电力灌溉网，这是上海市郊区农业技术改革计划中的一个重要组成部分。
    这个电力灌溉网的灌溉范围内共有可耕地十万多亩。全部土地将划为一百零五个基层灌溉区。各灌溉区内计划安装十马力的电动抽水机九十五台，各种人工降雨设备十处。这项工程在明年六月以前竣工并投入生产以后，将能保证这十万亩农田不再受旱灾的威胁，每年可增产蔬菜一百万到一百五十万担。农民的收入也将逐年增加。
    据初步估计，这项工程需要敷设电线三万五千公尺，建造机房一百多座，修筑输水渠道六、七百条，填、挖土方约三十八万方。工程投资共约一百八十万元。（本报驻上海记者）
