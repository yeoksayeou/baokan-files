    Recently, the Xi'an Agricultural Implement Research Institute successfully trial-produced a double-row cotton planter. This machine is easy to use and highly efficient. Two people with one draft animal can plant 35 to 40 mu of cotton per day, and the planting depth is consistent, the density is uniform, and it can also conserve moisture. Cotton planted with it emerges quickly and completely.
    In our country, cotton is mostly planted by drill or by hand scattering, which is very inefficient and the depth is uneven. If it is too deep, the seedlings will emerge late or not at all; if it is too shallow, the seedlings are easily burned to death by the sun, often requiring replanting. However, the cotton planting season is very short, and if planted late or after replanting, it will not mature until after the first frost. This has a negative impact on cotton yield and quality. In order to solve the problem of cotton planting, the state has imported some four-row cotton planters driven by tractors from the Soviet Union. However, they cannot yet be universally adopted. After the Xi'an Agricultural Implement Research Institute was established in 1950, it decided to manufacture a cotton planter suitable for the needs of the vast number of cotton farmers in our country. They actively studied the principles of Soviet planters, combined with our country's cotton planting habits and specific conditions such as climate and soil, and collectively researched a new type of cotton planter. With the efforts of all the technical personnel of the Agricultural Implement Research Institute, a animal-powered double-row cotton planter was successfully trial-produced in 1953. After appraisal in key cotton-producing areas of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces, the results were very good. For example, of the 25 cotton planters purchased by Shanxi Province, except for one that was not used due to drought, each machine planted an average of 100 mu, with good results. The You'ai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, used one cotton planter to plant 100 mu of cotton in less than three days, saving ten labor days. The saved animal power can plow 14 mu of land. The cotton planted by the Zhou Jiguan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lintong County emerged in nine days, four or five days earlier than with the old method of planting. In this experiment, the masses also raised many suggestions for improvement, such as the pulling rods and strips not being strong enough and easily deformed or damaged, and the transport wheels swinging from side to side, affecting forward movement. The technical personnel of the Agricultural Implement Research Institute have also improved these opinions, making the animal-powered double-row cotton planter more perfect. This year, cotton farmers in various places have requested to purchase cotton planters. Shanxi Province alone has requested to purchase 2,000 units. The production capacity of the Agricultural Implement Research Institute's processing plant is limited, and only 300 units have been made. Now, they have handed over the drawings to the agricultural implement manufacturing departments in Xinjiang and Shaanxi provinces so that they can first trial-produce and produce this new agricultural implement within the scope of these two provinces.

    双行棉花播种机
    李茜
    最近，西安农具研究所试制成功了双行棉花播种机。这种机器使用轻便，效率高，两个人用一头耕畜驾一部机器，每天能播种三十五亩到四十亩棉花，而且播种的深浅一致，密度均匀，还可以保墒。用它播种的棉花出苗既快又齐全。
    我国播种棉花大部分是用耧播种或用手撒种，效率很低，而且深浅不匀。太深了出苗晚或根本不出苗，太浅了出苗后容易被太阳晒死，往往需要补种。但是，棉花的种植季节很短，种晚了或经过补种，就要在霜降后才能成熟。这对棉花的产量和质量都有不好的影响。为了解决棉花播种问题，国家虽然从苏联进口了一些用拖拉机带动的四行棉花播种机。但是目前还不能普遍采用。西安农具研究所在一九五○年成立之后，就确定要制造一种适合于目前我国广大棉农需要的棉花播种机。他们积极学习苏联播种机的原理，结合我国种棉的习惯和气候、土壤等具体条件，集体研究新式棉花播种机。在农具研究所全体技术人员的努力下，一九五三年试制成功了一种畜力双行棉花播种机。经过陕西、山西、河南、山东、湖北、湖南、河北、江苏、浙江等省的重点棉区的鉴定，效果很好。如山西省买去的二十五部棉花播种机除一部因天旱未用外，平均每部机器播种一百亩，效果良好。陕西大荔县友爱农业生产合作社用一部棉花播种机不到三天的时间就播完一百亩棉花，省了十个劳动日。省下的畜力可以犁十四亩地。临潼县周济广农业生产合作社用播种机种的棉花，九天就出齐了苗，比旧法播种早出四、五天。在这次试验中，群众又提出很多改进的意见，如拉杆、拉条等零件不够坚固，易于变形或损坏，运输轮左右摇摆，影响前进等。农具研究所的技术人员们又根据这些意见加以改进，使得畜力双行棉花播种机更趋完善了。今年，各地棉农纷纷要求购买棉花播种机。仅山西省就要求购买二千部。农具研究所加工厂的生产能力有限，只做了三百部。现在，他们已经把图纸交给新疆和陕西等省的农具制造部门，以便首先在这两个省的范围内试制和生产这种新农具。
