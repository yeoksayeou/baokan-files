    Paying attention to cultivating mulberry fields, and increasing the yield of mulberry leaves, and expanding the area of mulberry planting, are prerequisites for developing silk production.
    In order to solve the problem of feed for expanding silkworm rearing, members of many agricultural cooperatives in Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, are actively carrying out winter fertilization of mulberry fields and other tasks. The 94 mu of mulberry fields in Daixi and Guangming agricultural cooperatives in Xizhang District of this county have been fertilized with an average of more than 160 dan of loess river mud and 41 dan of human manure per mu. More than 100 mu of mulberry fields in the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Nanquan District have mostly been fertilized. Recently, this cooperative also dredged a small river ditch on its own, digging more than 2,000 dan of mud to increase the amount of fertilizer. Forty-six agricultural cooperatives in the Xindu District are generally pruning mulberry trees. Many agricultural cooperatives in this county have included the reclamation of wasteland and the expansion of mulberry fields in their plans. According to the statistics of agricultural cooperatives in the four districts, it is initially planned to expand the area of mulberry fields by more than 1,870 mu next year.

    注意培育桑田
    提高桑叶产量，扩大植桑面积，是发展蚕丝生产的一个前提条件。
    为了解决扩大养蚕的饲料问题，江苏省无锡县许多农业合作社的社员正积极进行桑田冬季施肥等工作。这个县西漳区泰安乡戴西、光明等四个农业合作社的九十四亩桑田，平均每亩垩河泥一百六十多担、人粪四十一担。南泉区五星农业社一百多亩桑田已大部施过肥，最近这个社又单干一条小河沟，挖了二千多担泥，增加施肥量。新渎区四十六个农业合作社正普遍进行桑树剪枝。这个县很多农业合作社都把开垦荒地，扩大桑田面积订在计划里，根据四个区的农业合作社的统计，初步计划明年扩大桑田面积一千八百七十多亩。
