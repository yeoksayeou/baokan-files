    Agricultural Cooperativization Movement in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region
    Chairman of the People's Government of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Qin Yingji
    The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region is three years old. Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the autonomous region has achieved great development in politics, economy, and culture. After the victorious completion of the historical task of reforming the land system in the spring of 1953, the entire region launched an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation. By this spring, the number of agricultural production cooperatives had developed to 7,104, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for 9% of the total number of households. Cooperatives had been established in 78% of the townships throughout the region. The socialist enthusiasm of the masses is increasing day by day. However, due to the influence of right-leaning opportunist ideas in the leadership, the targets were compressed at that time, and many "spontaneous cooperatives" and "covert cooperatives" appeared in various places. Although these cooperatives had some problems due to the lack of specific leadership, they were generally able to persevere and were managed quite well.
    After Chairman Mao's report on agricultural cooperation and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party were issued, they greatly educated cadres at all levels in the autonomous region and encouraged the enthusiasm of people of all ethnic groups to take the path of cooperation. Now, a high tide of agricultural cooperation has been set off throughout the region. Peasants are signing up to join cooperatives by entire townships and villages. As of the end of November, more than 21,000 new cooperatives have been developed throughout the region. Adding the original 7,000 cooperatives, there are now a total of 28,833 cooperatives. The number of households joining the cooperatives has reached 50% of the total number of households. The number of new cooperatives has increased more than twofold, and the quality is also relatively good. The entire movement is smooth and healthy.
    The more than 7,000 old cooperatives are the banner for farmers of all ethnic groups to take the path of cooperation. The masses describe them as "red flags planted on the top of the mountain, who can't see them? Who is not convinced?" This year, more than 85% of the old cooperatives in the region increased production. In Zhendu and Mashan counties, all 324 old cooperatives increased production, and 170 of them more than doubled their production. Not only did agricultural cooperatives in the plains generally increase production, but those in mountainous areas also increased production. In many basically cooperative townships in mountainous areas, comprehensive production planning is underway to gradually transform "bare mountains into green forests" and "poor mountains into rich mountains."
    With the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the backward state of production in the past is gradually changing, and the yields of grain and other crops are continuously increasing. Take Jiulong Township in Shanglin County, which was basically cooperativized last winter and this spring, for example. Of the 4,056 mu of paddy fields in the township, only 631 mu were planted with two crops when they were managed individually; after cooperativization, it increased to 2,088 mu, more than doubling the past. In 1954, there were only 85 mu of densely planted small seedlings in the township, but this year it reached 1,567 mu. Mengdou Township in Pingguo County is a place with "nine parts rock and one part soil." The Mengdou Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative has 20 peasant households. Before the establishment of the cooperative, because the mountain land was scattered and operated by individual households, the farming was extensive and the yield was very low. After organizing the cooperative this year, intensive farming and meticulous cultivation were carried out, and a large amount of fertilizer was applied. All the corn adopted single-plant dense planting, detasseling, and pollination. The entire cooperative increased production by 43% compared to 1954. 社员蒙启彬, In 1954, 社员蒙启彬's total income was only 550 jin of grain, but this year his income from one season of corn was more than 1,560 jin. The entire cooperative also raises 97 pigs and 35 sheep. The masses outside the cooperative describe them as "pigs and sheep are full in the pens, and corn is full in the beams." In the past, Fulang Village in Fusui County was either drought or flood. In previous years, some people had proposed to carry out water conservancy projects and build canals and dams; however, people with more fields were afraid that they would not be able to dig them, and people with fewer fields said that even if they were dug well, they would not be able to benefit much from them. Some people also argued about the highness and lowness of the fields, the head and tail of the water, and everyone was afraid of suffering losses. Water conservancy has never been completed. After cooperativization last winter, the collective strength was brought into play, and two dams, one mountain pond, and three drainage and diversion ditches were built, and more than 1,200 mu of double-cropping fields were replanted throughout the village, and a bumper harvest was generally obtained. Now they also plan to build three more small reservoirs and three large mountain ponds, striving to eliminate water disasters in 1957 and replant all the fields with two crops, so as to contribute more to supporting national industrialization.
    The people of all ethnic groups have truly realized the benefits that cooperativization has brought them in the movement. The material and cultural lives of the broad masses of peasants have undergone significant changes. The 54 households in the Second Agricultural Cooperative of Jiangxiang Township in Zhendu County were mostly grain-deficient households before liberation. Nineteen people relied on long-term labor to maintain their lives, and five households were so hungry that they painfully sold their children. The people in the entire township lacked food and clothing, and there were only five or six people who were literate. Now, the members say: The days of mixing tears with porridge in the past have been blown away forever by the great storm of mutual aid and cooperation! With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, this township has increased production year after year. Now every household has surplus grain, and this year it has sold 9,500 jin of surplus grain, accounting for 27% of the total income. In recent years, the peasants have added many single and cotton clothes, and now each family is busy preparing new clothes for the New Year. After liberation, schools and night schools were established, and the children of peasants are studying in middle schools and primary schools, and there are also 15 literate people in the cooperative. In the evening and during slack seasons, in the village clubs, peasants read books, newspapers, sing, and live a happy and cultured life. Qitang Township in Baise County suffered a drought this year that was more severe than in 1949 before liberation. In that year, many people went out to escape, and six people starved to death outside. However, this year, under the leadership of the agricultural cooperative, the township persisted in fighting the drought, overcame the drought, and ensured the harvest. The cooperative also increased production by 20%, and the entire township safely survived the drought. The peasants of all ethnic groups in the region have seen their bright and happy future from these concrete facts, and they are determined to take the road of cooperativization. They said: We can't wait any longer, we can't sleep peacefully without joining the cooperative! Cooperatives are like magnets, attracting the vast number of peasants to the socialist road!
    In the process of mutual aid and cooperation, activists and cooperative management backbones are constantly discovered and growing. This year, the entire region trained a total of 138,000 backbones for building cooperatives. During the movement, party consolidation and party building work were also carried out in various places. Now, 90% of the townships in the region have established party branches, and 96% of the townships have established league branches. After the test and improvement of the movement, most of the party branches can lead the establishment of cooperatives, which provides a strong guarantee for the further development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives.
    The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a multi-ethnic region with the Zhuang ethnic group as the main body. In recent years, nearly 2,000 ethnic joint cooperatives have been established. These ethnic joint cooperatives fully embody the spirit of unity and friendship among the people of all ethnic groups. In the joint cooperatives, farmers of all ethnic groups can give full play to their own strengths, learn from each other, help each other, and learn from each other's strengths to overcome their weaknesses to jointly improve production. In some Zhuang-Yao joint cooperatives, Zhuang members take the initiative to help Yao members learn farming techniques such as plowing, harrowing, sowing, transplanting, weeding, and fertilizing. Yao members also sincerely pass on their expertise in planting mountain miscellaneous grains and preventing birds, hunting animals, and planting trees to Zhuang members. Some joint cooperatives also reasonably divide labor according to the different strengths of the members of various ethnic groups. In this way, the production technology of farmers of all ethnic groups has been improved, and production has continued to increase. None of the 31 ethnic joint cooperatives in Donglan County have failed to increase production. Economic cooperation among ethnic groups has further promoted the close political unity of ethnic groups.
    The entire agricultural cooperation movement is advancing by constantly overcoming difficulties. The peasants of all ethnic groups have demonstrated a high degree of socialist enthusiasm and creativity. Due to historical reasons, the people of ethnic minorities are culturally backward. In the large-scale development of agricultural cooperatives throughout the region, there is a general lack of accountants in various places. However, no difficulty can thwart the determination of farmers of all ethnic groups to establish cooperatives. They use collective wisdom and tenacious spirit to overcome various difficulties. At the beginning, they used bamboo strips and straw stalks to keep accounts; in some townships, one accountant worked as the accountant for three cooperatives; some tried to invite people from other villages to be accountants and sent their own members to be apprentices; some cooperatives invited teachers, and the members went to the fields during the day and learned culture at night. How to deal with the scattered land in mountain villages? The masses delineated the farming areas and contracted the work nearby; if there were difficulties in holding meetings, they used sheep horns, cattle horns, and broadcasting tubes as liaison tools, one village passed on to another, and the time was not slow. In order to shorten the mountain roads, they used their own hands to open up shortcut after shortcut from the barren mountains. In the process of running the cooperatives, there was a lack of experience at the beginning, and the management was somewhat chaotic. However, after more than a year of production tests and continuous rectification, the operation and management of the old cooperatives have been gradually improved. A lot of experience has been gained in short-term contracting, long-term contracting, and production planning, and these cooperatives have become more and more consolidated.
    The Party and the government are always concerned about the difficulties of the people of all ethnic groups in developing mutual aid and cooperation. In this year of great development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Party and the government transferred more than 16,000 cadres from various levels of government to lead and help the masses build and manage cooperatives. Various places have also planned to successively open short-term training courses for accounting personnel, and selected active men and women from various places to study, and more than 14,000 people have been trained so far. A regular guidance system has also been established in the work to continue to help them solve difficulties and improve their culture. In addition, various places have also trained more than 3,500 water conservancy, forestry, and animal husbandry workers, and established 152 agricultural technology promotion stations to help the masses promote, summarize, and improve farming techniques. In the past three years, the government has also issued a large number of loans and relief funds, and paid special attention to the work of building water conservancy projects, which have played a significant role in promoting the development of cooperation.
    The task of building cooperatives before autumn in the entire region has been overfulfilled. During this period, various counties also actively carried out pilot projects for more than 60 advanced agricultural production cooperatives. At present, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of all ethnic groups in the region are further improving and consolidating the existing agricultural production cooperatives, vigorously carrying out the winter production movement, and have begun to carry out the planning of the cooperative and the production planning for next year. The people of all ethnic groups in the region will fight with full confidence for the glorious task of realizing basic cooperativization in the entire region in the spring of 1957.

    桂西僮族自治区的农业合作化运动
    桂西僮族自治区人民政府主席　覃应机
    桂西僮族自治区成立三周年了。在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，自治区无论在政治、经济和文化各方面都得到了很大的发展。在一九五三年春胜利地结束了改革土地制度的历史任务以后，全区就开展了以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。到今年春天，农业生产合作社已发展到七千一百零四个，入社的农户占总农户数的百分之九，全区百分之七十八的乡都已建社。群众的社会主义积极性日益高涨。但是由于领导方面的右倾机会主义思想的影响，当时指标是被压缩了些，各地都出现了不少的“自发社”和“明组暗社”。这些社虽然因为缺乏具体的领导，有一些问题，但是后来一般都能坚持下去，办得也还不错。
    毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告和党中央七届六中全会的决议下达后，大大地教育了自治区各级干部和鼓舞了各民族人民走合作化道路的积极性。现在全区已经掀起了农业合作化运动的高潮。整乡整屯的农民报名要求入社。截至十一月底止，全区新发展了二万一千多个社，加上原有的七千多个，现在共有二万八千八百三十三个社。入社农户已经占总农户的百分之五十。新社数量增加二倍多，质量也比较好，整个运动是顺利和健康的。
    七千多个老社是各族农民走合作化道路的旗帜。群众形容它们是“一面面插在山顶上的红旗，那个看不见？那个心不服？”今年全区的老社百分之八十五以上增产。镇都、马山两县共有三百二十四个老社，社社增产，其中增产一倍以上的就有一百七十个社。不仅平原地区的农业合作社普遍增产，山区也增产。在山区的许多基本合作化的乡正在进行全面的生产规划，要逐步将“光山变绿林”，“穷山变富山”。
    随着农业互助合作运动的发展，过去生产落后的状态正在逐步改变，粮食及其他作物产量不断地得到提高。就拿去冬今春基本合作化的上林县九龙乡来说，全乡四千零五十六亩水田，在分散经营的时候，改种两造的只有六百三十一亩；合作化后增加到了二千零八十八亩，比过去增加二倍多。一九五四年全乡的小株密植田只有八十五亩，而今年就达到了一千五百六十七亩。平果县孟豆乡是一个“九分岩一分土”的地方。孟豆农牧生产合作社有二十户农民，没有建社以前，因为山地分散，单家独户经营，耕作粗放，产量很低。今年组织合作社以后，精耕细作，大量施肥，玉米全部采用了单株密植，去雄授粉，全社比一九五四年增产百分之四十三。社员蒙启彬，一九五四年全年收入只有五百五十斤粮食，今年一季玉米就收入一千五百六十多斤。全社还养有猪九十七头，羊三十五只。社外群众形容他们是“猪羊满栏，玉米满梁”。扶绥县扶梁村过去不是旱就是涝，往年也曾有人提出搞水利，开沟筑坝；可是田多的人怕挖不成，田少的人说挖好了自己也占不了多少便宜，还有的争田高、田低、水头、水尾，大家都怕自己吃亏，水利始终没有修成。去冬合作化以后，发挥了集体的力量，就修好了两个水坝，一口山塘，挖了三条排引水沟，全村改种了一千二百多亩双造田，普遍获得了丰收。现在他们还计划再修三个小型水库，三口大山塘，争取一九五七年消灭水患，全部改种两造，为支援国家工业化贡献更多力量。
    各族人民在运动中都真正体会到了合作化给他们带来的好处。广大农民的物质和文化生活已经起了显著的变化。镇都县降祥乡第二农业合作社的五十四户人家，解放前大都是缺粮户，有十九人是靠打长工维持生活，还有五户饿得没法，忍痛卖掉了自己的儿女，全乡人缺衣少食，只有五六个初识文字的人。现在呢，社员说：过去那种鼻涕眼泪拌粥的日子，已经给互助合作的大风暴永远吹跑了！随着互助合作运动的发展，这个乡连年得到增产。现在家家都是余粮户，今年已经卖出余粮九千五百斤，占总收入的百分之二十七。几年来农民添制了许多单的和棉的衣服，现在各家正在忙着准备过年的新衣。解放后成立了学校和夜校，农民的子女在中学和小学学习，社里也有了十五个识字的人。到晚上和农闲的时候，在乡村的俱乐部里，农民们看书、读报、唱歌，过着愉快的有文化的生活。百色县七塘乡今年遭受的旱灾比解放前的一九四九年还严重，那年很多人出外逃生，有六人饿死在外。可是今年该乡在农业合作社的带头下，坚持抗旱，战胜了旱灾，保证了收成，合作社还增产百分之二十，全乡安然度过了旱灾。全区各族农民从这些具体的事实中看到了自己美好幸福的未来，他们决心走合作化的道路。他们说：再也等不下去了，不得入社睡都不安然！合作社正像磁石一样，吸引着广大的农民奔向社会主义的大道！
    在互助合作过程中，积极分子和办社骨干不断地发现和成长。全区今年共训练了十三万八千名建社的骨干。运动中各地还进行了整党和建党的工作，现在全区百分之九十的乡建立了党支部，百分之九十六的乡有了团的支部。经过运动的考验和提高，大部分党支部都能领导办社，这对农业合作社的进一步发展和巩固提供了有力的保证。
    桂西僮族自治区是以僮族为主体的多民族的地区，几年来已建立起近二千个民族联合社。这些民族联合社充分体现了各族人民团结友爱的精神。在联合社里各民族农民都能发挥自己的特长，互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短来共同搞好生产。在一些僮族瑶族联合社中，僮族社员就主动地帮助瑶族社员学习犁田、耙田、下种、插秧、锄草、施肥等耕作技术，瑶族社员也真诚地将他们擅长种植山间杂粮和防鸟、打兽及植树的经验传授给僮族社员。有的联合社还根据各族社员不同的长处，合理分工。这样各民族农民的生产技术都得到提高，生产也就不断的增长。东兰县的三十一个民族联合社没有一个不增产的。各民族在经济上的合作又进一步地促进了各民族政治上的亲密团结。
    整个农业合作化运动是在不断克服困难中前进的。各族农民发挥了高度的社会主义积极性和创造性。由于历史的原因，少数民族人民文化落后，在全区农业社大发展中，各地都普遍缺乏会计。但是任何困难都不能挫折各族农民办社的决心。他们用集体的智慧和顽强精神来克服各种困难。开始他们用竹条草秆来记账；有的乡一个会计兼三个社的会计；有的设法到外村请人当会计，自己派社员去做徒弟；有的社请来教师，社员们白天下地，晚上学文化。山区村庄土地分散怎样办呢？群众划好耕作区，就近包工经营；联系开会有困难，他们用羊角、牛角、广播筒作为联络的工具，一屯传一屯，时间也不慢。为了缩短山区的路程，他们用自己的双手从荒山上开出一条条近路来。在办社过程中开始缺乏经验，经营管理有些紊乱。但是经过一年多来的生产考验和不断的整顿，老社的经营管理都已逐步改善了，无论在短包工、长包工以及生产规划方面都得到了不少的经验，这些社也愈加巩固了。
    党和政府时时关怀各族人民在发展互助合作中的困难。在互助合作运动大发展的今年，党和政府从各级机关中抽调了一万六千多名干部去领导和帮助群众建社和办社。各地还有计划地陆续开办短期会计人员训练班，抽调各地的男女积极分子来学习，现在已经训练出一万四千多人。在工作中还建立经常的辅导制度，继续帮助他们解决困难和提高文化。此外，各地还训练了三千五百多个水利、林业、畜牧工作人员，设立了一百五十二个农业技术推广站，帮助群众推广、总结和提高耕作技术。三年来政府还发放了大批贷款和救济金，特别是重视了兴修水利的工作，这些都对促进合作化的发展起了重大的作用。
    全区的秋前建社任务已经超额完成。在这期间各县还积极地进行了六十多个高级农业生产合作社的试点工作。目前，全区各族人民在党和政府的领导下，正在将现有的农业生产合作社进一步健全和巩固起来，大力开展冬季生产运动，同时已着手进行明年合作社的规划和生产的规划工作。全区各族人民将满怀信心地为在一九五七年春实现全区基本合作化的光荣任务而斗争。
