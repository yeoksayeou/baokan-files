Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 30th (TASS) – The Italian Communist Party Central Committee plenary session opened in Rome on November 28th. The General Secretary of the Communist Party, Togliatti, delivered a report to the meeting entitled: "The Communist Party Leads the Working Class and the People in the Struggle for the Freedom and Welfare of the Working People, for the Relaxation of the International and Domestic Situation, and for Peace."

Togliatti said that a new atmosphere had emerged in Italy after the establishment of the Segni government. The authorities began to show more respect for the freedoms stipulated in the Constitution. However, the government and the parties supporting the government have not taken consistent action to show that they are implementing a new policy. Therefore, the reactionary forces in the country have become rampant again, and their aim is to attack democracy and discriminate against progressives.

Togliatti then spoke about the economic situation in Italy. He pointed out that one of the main reasons for the deterioration of the country's financial situation is inflation. At the same time, competition in the international market is intensifying and military spending is constantly increasing. The government has refused to increase the wages of certain civil servants and has implemented new consumer taxes that place a heavy burden on the middle class and the working masses. Poverty is becoming increasingly acute in cities and villages. Consumer prices are constantly rising. Unemployment is increasing due to the dismissal of workers by large industrial enterprises that intensify the exploitation of workers. On the other hand, the profits of business owners have greatly increased. Class contradictions are becoming increasingly acute, as evidenced by the offensive of business owners against the trade union and political rights of the working people.

Togliatti emphasized that the government refused to implement land reform and implemented policies in rural areas that increased the profits of large landowners. Farm laborers and poor peasants are flocking to cities to make a living, and tenant farmers are also shrouded in anxiety. All of this has aroused increasing dissatisfaction among the broad masses in cities and villages.

Togliatti pointed out that "the Italian government does not have a real national policy." Referring to the results of the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, he pointed out that the conference failed because Western countries attempted to force the Soviet Union to accept their demands. However, this does not mean that the process of easing international tensions has stopped. Easing international tensions remains our goal, as it has always been, and this easing is achievable.

Togliatti continued, it is also possible to ease tensions in domestic policy. However, this relaxation should be based on the observance of the Constitution by all citizens and all political and economic organizations. He pointed out that it is necessary to strive to improve the economic conditions of the working people and all small property owners. Only constant pressure from the people can make the struggle against discrimination and for improved economic and social conditions achieve significant success. Togliatti said that all conditions are now in place to establish a broad front to resist the attacks of the reactionaries. Not only progressive parties feel uneasy and are committed to the struggle, but also the broadest strata of residents have a strong desire to change the situation.

Togliatti said that in this situation, our task is to explain the situation to everyone and point out that there are now new and broad possibilities for establishing contact, reaching agreements, and implementing unity in order to organize a people's movement. This movement will be able to eliminate the dangers faced by the country, strengthen democracy and peace, and win more welfare for everyone.

    陶里亚蒂在意共中央全会上谈国内外局势
    新华社据塔斯社罗马三十日讯　意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议十一月二十八日在罗马开幕。共产党总书记陶里亚蒂向会议作了报告，报告的题目是：“共产党领导着工人阶级和人民争取劳动人民的自由、福利，争取缓和国际和国内局势以及争取和平的斗争”。
    陶里亚蒂说，塞尼政府成立后，国内出现过一种新气氛。当局开始比较尊重宪法规定的自由。但是政府和支持政府的党派并没有以一贯的行动来表明它们在执行新的方针。因此，国内的反动势力又重新猖狂起来了，它们的目的是要进攻民主，歧视进步人士。
    陶里亚蒂接着谈到了意大利的经济状况。他指出，国家财政状况恶化的主要原因之一是通货膨胀。和这同时，国际市场上的竞争日益加紧，军费负担不断增加。政府拒绝增加某些国家公务人员的工资，并且实行了给中等阶层和劳动群众带来沉重负担的新的消费品税。城市和乡村中，贫困现象越来越尖锐化。消费品价格不断上涨。由于加紧剥削工人的大工业企业实行解雇工人，失业人数不断增加。另一方面，企业主的利润大大增长。阶级矛盾越来越尖锐，企业主对劳动人民的工会和政治权利的进攻就足以证明这一点。
    陶里亚蒂着重指出，政府拒绝实行土地改革，并且在农村中实行使得大地主的利润增加的政策。雇农和贫农流入城市谋生，在佃农中间也笼罩着不安情绪。所有这些引起了城市和农村的广大群众的日益不满。
    陶里亚蒂指出，“意大利政府没有真正的民族政策”。他在谈到日内瓦四国外交部长会议的结果时指出，会议所以遭到失败，是因为西方国家企图强迫苏联接受自己的要求。但是，这绝不等于说缓和国际紧张局势的进程已经停止了，缓和国际紧张局势仍然像过去一样是我们的目标，这种缓和是可以做到的。
    陶里亚蒂继续说，在国内政策方面，缓和紧张局势也是有可能的。但是，这种缓和应当以全体公民以及所有政治和经济组织遵守宪法为基础。他指出，必须争取改善劳动人民和所有小有产者的经济状况。只有人民方面施加经常的压力，才能使反对歧视和争取改善经济和社会条件的斗争获得重大的成就。陶里亚蒂说，现在要建立广泛的阵线来抵抗反动派的进攻是具备一切条件的，感到不安和致力于斗争的不仅有进步党派，最广泛的居民阶层也有着要求改变局势的强烈愿望。
    陶里亚蒂说，在这种情况下，我们的任务是要向所有的人说明情况，并且指明，目前有着新的广泛的可能性来建立接触、取得协议和实行团结，以便组织一个人民运动。这个运动将能够消除国家受到的危险，加强民主和和平，为大家争取到更多的福利。
