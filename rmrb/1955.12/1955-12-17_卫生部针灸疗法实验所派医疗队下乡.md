The Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China, in order to meet the needs of the agricultural cooperation movement, specially organized an acupuncture medical team mainly composed of students from the advanced acupuncture training class, and went to work in the rural areas of Tong County, Hebei Province, and Changzhi District, Shanxi Province, in early November. Under the attention and assistance of the local party organizations and governments, and in cooperation with local health workers, they have achieved remarkable results in the past month.

The acupuncture medical team that went to Tong County was divided into six groups, using the six areas of Matou, Xiji, Xuguantun, Yongledian, Langfu, and Huoxian as bases, cooperating with local medical groups or joint clinics to provide acupuncture treatment for sick farmers. Each outpatient location sees a minimum of fifty patients per day, and more than one hundred patients at times. Many farmers who have suffered from rheumatic joint pain, chronic bronchitis, chronic gastroenteritis, and other diseases for many years have been cured this time. Some farmers suffering from severe corneal opacity and prolapse of the rectum for more than ten years have also been cured. Common rural ailments such as diarrhea and indigestion in children, women's diseases, and difficulty in raising arms in the elderly have also been treated effectively. In addition, the medical team also held an acupuncture training class in Tong County, with more than 50 students, most of whom were doctors of traditional Chinese medicine, and a small number of whom were Western medicine doctors. This class has already graduated, and the teaching effect is very good. Now, the acupuncture training class for Tong County District has also started.

The acupuncture medical team that went to Changzhi District, in addition to treating patients in the location of the commissioner's office, held an acupuncture training class for the district. There were more than 190 students, half Western medicine and half traditional Chinese medicine, with the main goal of training acupuncture medical cadres for agricultural production cooperatives and industrial and mining hospitals. They also sent team members to the health center of the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Changzhi to assist in their work, with more than 20 patients seeking treatment every day; at the same time, they also helped the doctors of traditional Chinese and Western medicine near the farm to study acupuncture. They also sent team members to the Quzhai Agricultural Production Cooperative for outpatient treatment, with nearly 50 patients seeking treatment every day; nearby doctors of traditional Chinese medicine also took the initiative to come and learn acupuncture. At present, they have gone to nine regions to cooperate with local medical organizations in their work.

The team members have always maintained a hard-working style in their work, learning from local traditional Chinese medicine practitioners on the one hand, and selflessly serving the farmers on the other, and training local acupuncture medical cadres. They have been warmly welcomed and supported by the local people, and have also gained valuable insights ideologically. Many of them are professors, lecturers, and attending physicians from national higher medical colleges and hospitals. Some said, "The encouragement and support of the Party organization and the government, and the labor enthusiasm of the farmers, have greatly stimulated our thinking of serving the people wholeheartedly." Some examined their past thinking of not paying attention to traditional Chinese medicine, and deeply felt that traditional Chinese medicine has a broad mass base.

The Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute recently sent a working group to Henan Province at the invitation to give lectures to the acupuncture training class for physicians organized by the Provincial Health Department. This training class has more than 50 students and is specifically held to carry out acupuncture treatment work in rural areas and various hospitals. The content of the lectures mainly focuses on the experience of acupuncture treatment of common rural diseases and the principles of acupuncture treatment.

The Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute plans to convene medical personnel from various provinces (two or three from each province) next year to run an acupuncture training class, so that acupuncture therapy can be better used in rural areas across the country.

    卫生部针灸疗法实验所派医疗队下乡
    中华人民共和国卫生部针灸疗法实验所为了适应农业合作化运动的需要，特以高级针灸师资训练班学员为主力组织了针灸医疗队，在十一月上旬分别到河北省通县和山西省长治专区的农村工作。他们在当地党组织和政府的重视和协助下，同当地卫生工作人员合作，一月以来取得了显著成绩。
    到通县的针灸医疗队分为六个小组，以马头、西集、徐官屯、永乐店、郎府、漷县六个地区为据点，配合当地医疗组或联合诊所，为患病农民进行针灸治疗。每一门诊地点的求诊病人，每天最少五十人，多时一百人以上。许多农民多年来患风湿性关节痛、慢性支气管炎、慢性胃肠炎等病，这次有不少人治好了。有些农民患着严重的眼角混浊症和十年以上的脱肛症等，也治疗痊愈了。农村常见的小儿腹泻和消化不良症、妇女病、老年人的举臂困难症等，治疗效果也很好。此外，医疗队还在通县举办了一个针灸进修班，学员五十多人，大部分是中医，小部分是西医。这个班已经结业，教学效果很好。现在，为通县专区办的针灸进修班又已经开学。
    到长治专区的针灸医疗队，除了为专署所在地的患者治疗以外，为专区举办了针灸训练班。学员有一百九十多名，西医和中医各半，主要目标是为农业生产合作社和工矿医院培养针灸医疗干部。他们还派了队员到长治的中苏友好集体农庄卫生所协助工作，求诊病人每天有二十多人；同时也帮助农庄附近的中、西医们进修针灸术。他们还派了队员到璩寨农业生产合作社进行门诊治疗，求诊病人每天近五十人；附近的中医们也主动前来学习针灸术。目前，他们分别到九个地区，配合当地医疗组织进行工作。
    队员们在工作中一直保持艰苦的作风，一面向当地中医学习，一面忘我地为农民患者服务，并且为当地培养针灸医疗干部。他们受到了当地人民群众的热情欢迎和支持，同时在思想上也有了宝贵的收获。他们多是全国高等医学院校的教授、讲师和医院的主治医师等，有的说：“党组织和政府的鼓励和支持，农民的劳动热情，大大地激发了我们全心全意为人民服务的思想。”有的检查了自己过去不重视祖国医学的思想，并且深深感到：祖国医学有广大的群众基础。
    针灸疗法实验所最近又应邀派出了一个工作组到河南省，为省卫生厅开办的医师针灸训练班讲课。这个训练班有五十多个学员，是专为农村和各医院开展针灸治疗工作而举办的。讲课内容即以农村常见疾病的针灸治疗经验和针灸治病原理为主。
    针灸疗法实验所预定，明年调集各省的医务人员（每省二人或三人）开办一针灸训练班，以使针灸疗法能在全国农村更好地使用。
