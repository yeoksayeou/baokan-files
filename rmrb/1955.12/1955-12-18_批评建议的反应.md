    Letter from the General Office of the Ministry of Education: The criticism of the Ministry's bureaucratic work style in handling official documents, raised in the "Reader's Letters Page" on November 27, is of great help to us in improving our work. The main reasons for this phenomenon are the unclear division of labor among the various units of the Ministry, the numerous levels and procedures for handling official documents; and the fact that even when units are working in the same building, they still exchange opinions through official documents. We are studying concrete measures to change this situation.
    Letter from the General Store of Xinhua Bookstore: The criticism from readers on the "Reader's Letters Page" on November 27, that our store does not pay enough attention to the distribution of science and technology books, is completely correct. We sincerely accept this criticism and have decided to organize an inspection team to conduct a key inspection of the distribution of science and technology books in some branches, and will notify branches in all industrial and mining cities across the country to seriously study the People's Daily's criticism and examine their own work. In addition, the Beijing branch has been instructed to expand and improve the mail-order business of science and technology books to meet the needs of readers across the country.
    Letter from the Shilon County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Guangxi Province: The criticism in the letter "Deputy Minister Niu's Arrogance" on the "Reader's Letters Page" on November 21, is completely in line with the facts. We have already conducted a serious criticism of Comrade Niu Guiming's mistakes at the county committee meeting; Comrade Niu Guiming has made several written self-criticisms, guaranteeing that he will not make similar mistakes in the future.

    批评建议的反应
    教育部办公厅来信：十一月二十七日“读者来信专页”对我部处理公文中的文牍主义作风提出了批评，这对于我们改进工作有很大的帮助。产生这种现象的主要原因是我部各单位分工不明确，处理公文的层次和手续繁多；有些单位虽然在一个楼里办公，互相交换意见也要通过公文来进行。我们正在研究具体办法来改变这种状况。
    新华书店总店来信：十一月二十七日“读者来信专页”上读者对我店不重视科学技术书籍发行工作的批评，是完全正确的。我们诚恳地接受这一批评，决定组织检查组对某些分店的科学技术书籍发行情况进行一次重点检查，并将通知全国各工矿城市分店认真研究人民日报的批评，检查自己的工作。此外，还责成北京分店扩大和改进科学技术书籍的邮购代办业务，以满足各地读者的需要。
    中共广西省石龙县委会来信：十一月二十一日“读者来信专页”上“牛副部长的威风”一信中所提出的批评是完全符合事实的。我们已经在县委会上对牛贵明同志的错误进行了严肃的批评；牛贵明同志已经作出多次的书面检讨，保证今后不再犯类似的错误。
