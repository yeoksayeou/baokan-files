Strengthen Leadership Over Cultural Work in Factories and Mines

The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently jointly issued "Instructions on Further Developing Cultural and Artistic Work in Factories, Mines, Construction Sites, and Enterprises." These instructions are timely and correct. The emphasis in the instructions on strengthening the planning of the development of cultural undertakings in factories and mines, implementing overall consideration and reasonable arrangements, and gradually incorporating cultural undertakings in factories and mines into the national plan, are all important issues in the current cultural work in factories and mines. Properly solving these problems and strengthening leadership over cultural work in factories and mines will enable it to serve the socialist cause more effectively.

Since the "Instructions on Strengthening Cultural and Artistic Work in Factories, Mines, Construction Sites, and Enterprises" issued by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions last June, they have been implemented more conscientiously in many provinces, cities, and factories and mines. Cultural work in factories and mines has taken a big step forward. The content of amateur cultural and artistic activities of employees has become richer and more diverse than in the past, and the relationship between government cultural departments and trade union organizations has improved. The guidance work of professional art groups led by government cultural departments for cultural and artistic activities in factories and mines has been strengthened; some regions have held performances and awards for amateur activities of employees, and held training courses to improve the level of amateur cultural and artistic activities of employees. Judging from the achievements of the amateur music and dance observation performances held in eight cities and one industrial trade union at the beginning of this year, last year's instructions have played a significant role in some regions.

However, if we conduct a comprehensive and serious inspection, except for some large cities with relatively concentrated industries, last year's instructions have not been implemented widely enough or deeply enough. The development of cultural work in factories and mines is still very uneven. Generally speaking, industrial cities are better than provinces and regions, factories are better than mines, and factories and mines are better than construction sites. The correct policy for cultural work in factories and mines has not been universally implemented well. In many factories and mines, the content of literary and artistic activities is still excessively restricted, or the erroneous slogan of "three no performances" (that is, performances that are not related to production, performances that are not related to factories and mines, and performances that are not related to the factory itself are not allowed) is still put forward, or the educational significance of the performance content is completely ignored, and formalism is pursued, extravagance and waste are engaged in, and even vulgar entertainment is engaged in. In many factories and mines, amateur cultural and artistic activities of employees are not carried out regularly, and are sometimes hot and sometimes cold, which affects the cultural life of employees and also affects production. In many factories and mines, there have been no amateur cultural and artistic activities for a long time. Workers say: "Looking forward to Sunday, fearing Sunday when it comes." Due to the lack of normal and necessary cultural life, some factories and mines appear lifeless during rest periods. Workers either sleep, stroll around the streets, or play cards until late at night, and even rent and read pornographic publications and go to vulgar entertainment venues, thus suffering serious erosion from the decadent bourgeois culture both physically and mentally.

However, this situation has not aroused the vigilance and attention of the party, government, and especially trade union leaders of those factories and mines. They have not taken the necessary and effective measures to correct this situation; they have not cared about the cultural life of employees as much as they care about production. Therefore, it is necessary to once again raise this issue to the leaders of these factories and mines and draw their attention to it: Strengthening the leadership of the factory and mine party committee over cultural activities in factories and mines is the key to correctly and smoothly carrying out the cultural life of factories and mines. Here, we can compare two enterprises of similar size: In the Taiyuan Printing Factory, because the party committee puts amateur literary and artistic activities into the entire propaganda plan of the factory for unified research and arrangement, regularly discusses and reviews the plan for literary and artistic activities, and also promptly solves some necessary conditions for carrying out literary and artistic activities, and actively leads the development of literary and artistic activities, as a result, in this not-so-large factory, the cultural life of employees is much better than in many large factories. However, in the Taiyuan Transportation Factory, because the leaders not only do not actively support, but instead passively restrict, believing that engaging in cultural activities takes time and "affects production," saying that the theater troupe is "a mess," saying that the workers who engage in literary and artistic activities have "hooligan consciousness," saying that "investing the money for buying basketballs in production can play a role, and using it to buy basketballs is a waste," as a result, there has been no cultural life in the factory for a long time, and the production morale of employees has been affected. Isn't this a very obvious contrast?

Strengthening the leadership over cultural work in factories and mines, in addition to recognizing ideologically that cultural work in factories and mines is an important political work in carrying out political education for employees in daily life, cultivating communist moral qualities, meeting the cultural needs of employees, and resisting and overcoming the erosion of bourgeois ideology, another important aspect is to incorporate cultural work in factories and mines into the national plan. Our government cultural departments at all levels and factory and mine leaders should recognize that: Cultural work in factories and mines is an important part of the entire national cultural undertaking, and it is inseparable from the development of the entire national construction undertaking. Although it has been repeatedly emphasized in the past that it is necessary to strengthen the planning of cultural work in factories and mines, there has not been much improvement in this regard. In many places, "planning" is still only regarded as the arrangement of amateur literary and artistic activity projects of employees in the region and factory, the arrangement of schedules, the use of funds, etc., and not from a larger perspective, to gradually incorporate the cultural undertakings of factories and mines into the national plan. The instructions pointed out that one of the main problems and shortcomings in the current cultural work in factories and mines is: "Government cultural departments and trade union organizations have not yet fully recognized in their thinking the profound significance of the cultural undertakings of the trade union system as a component of the entire national cultural undertaking, and therefore seriously lack the thinking and measures for overall planning; the planning of the development of cultural undertakings of the trade union system is not strong, and generally lacks effective management, and the utilization rate of equipment is not high; the guiding principles and policies for cultural work in factories and mines are not implemented well enough, some government cultural departments and cultural institutions are still relatively weak in their thinking of serving workers, and their guidance and support for the cultural undertakings of the trade union system is not enough, and they even disregard or restrict them; some trade union organizations and trade union cadres do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of cultural work, especially the importance of amateur cultural and artistic activities of employees, abandon leadership, or intentionally or unintentionally put cultural activities in opposition to production." Gradually incorporating the cultural undertakings of factories and mines into the national plan is an important measure to overcome the above shortcomings and further develop cultural work in factories and mines.

The key to incorporating the cultural undertakings of factories and mines into the national plan lies in the fact that the cultural authorities and trade union organizations at all levels must implement the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership" as instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong. How should the construction of cultural undertakings in factories and mines be developed reasonably? How should the cultural funds of the trade union system be used in the most needed places? How should existing equipment be fully utilized and its potential be brought into play? How should cultural workers in factories and mines be trained in a planned way? How should government cultural departments strengthen the unified arrangement and planned management of various cultural undertakings in factories and mines? All of these should have comprehensive planning.

The leaders of government cultural departments and trade union organizations at all levels must first of all have a clear understanding, and should have some understanding of the number, type, and main situation and problems of amateur cultural and artistic activities of employees in important factories, mines, construction sites, and enterprises in the region; they should conduct in-depth and comprehensive investigations, make comprehensive considerations, and make unified arrangements for the existing strength, the development and use plans of cultural undertakings, the plans of various cultural institutions to serve factories and mines, construction sites, the plans for guidance and training of cadres, the plans for supplying literary and artistic materials to factories, etc.; they should clearly stipulate the specific guiding principles and tasks of subordinate institutions. On the other hand, the party organizations and administrative leaders of factories and mines must attach importance to amateur cultural and artistic activities of employees, include the leadership of amateur cultural and artistic activities of employees on the agenda, help the trade union solve specific difficulties such as time, venues, and funds, designate responsible departments, and regularly check the cultural work of the trade union.

According to the provisions of the First Five-Year Plan, the total number of workers and staff in our country will reach 25.24 million. Such a large number of employees are the backbone force for building socialism. How to better meet their rapidly growing cultural demands, and constantly improve their class consciousness, cultivate their communist ideological qualities, inspire their production enthusiasm, and make them make more contributions to the great cause of socialist industrialization of the motherland through the powerful tool of culture and art, this is the noble task of cultural work in all factories, mines, and enterprises.

### 加强对工矿文化工作的领导

    加强对工矿文化工作的领导
    中华人民共和国文化部和中华全国总工会最近联合发布了“关于进一步开展厂矿、工地、企业中文化艺术工作的指示”。这个指示是及时的，正确的。指示里所着重提出的加强工矿文化事业发展的计划性，实行统筹兼顾、合理安排，使工矿文化事业逐步地纳入国家计划的轨道等项，都是当前工矿文化工作中的重要问题。妥善地解决这些问题，加强对工矿文化工作的领导，将会使工矿文化工作更有效地为社会主义事业服务。
    去年六月，中央人民政府文化部和中华全国总工会“关于加强厂矿、工地、企业中文化艺术工作的指示”发布以后，在许多省、市和厂矿得到比较认真的贯彻。工矿文化工作向前迈进了一大步。职工业余文艺活动的内容，比过去丰富多样了，政府文化部门和工会组织之间的关系改进了。政府文化部门领导的专业文艺团体对工矿文艺活动的辅导工作有所加强；某些地区举办了职工业余活动的会演和评奖，举办了训练班，提高了职工业余文艺活动的水平。从今年年初举行的八个城市和一个产业工会的职工业余音乐、舞蹈观摩演出大会的成绩看来，去年的指示在某些地区已经起了不少的作用。
    但是，如果普遍地、认真地检查起来，除了一些工业比较集中的大城市以外，去年的指示贯彻得还不够广泛，还不够深入。工矿文化工作的发展，还是很不平衡的。一般说来，工业城市要比省区好些，工厂要比矿山好些，厂矿又要比工地好些。对工矿文化工作的正确方针，也不是普遍都执行得好。在不少的厂矿里，仍然在过多地限制文艺活动的内容，或者继续提出“三不演”（即内容和生产无关的不演，和厂矿无关的不演，和本厂无关的不演）的错误口号，或者完全不顾到演出内容的教育意义，追求形式，铺张浪费，甚至流于低级庸俗的娱乐。在不少的厂矿里，职工业余文艺活动开展得很不经常，忽冷忽热，既影响了职工群众的文化生活，也影响了生产。在不少的厂矿里，长时期没有业余文艺活动。工人们说：“不到星期盼星期，到了星期怕星期。”由于缺乏正常的、必要的文化生活，某些厂矿在休息时间内，显得死气沉沉。工人们不是闷头睡觉，闲逛马路，就是玩扑克玩到深更半夜，甚至去租阅黄色书刊，出入下流娱乐场所，因而身心上严重地受到了资产阶级腐朽文化的侵蚀。
    可是，这种情况并没有引起那些厂矿的党、政特别是工会领导人员的警惕和重视。他们并没有采取必要的有效的措施来纠正这种情况；他们并没有像关心生产那样地来关心职工群众的文化生活。因此，就需要再一次地向这些厂矿的领导人员提出，并且引起他们的注意：厂矿党委加强对厂矿文化活动的领导，是正确地、顺利地开展厂矿文化生活的关键。这里可以把两个规模差不多的企业做对比：太原印刷厂，由于党委把业余文艺活动放在全厂整个的宣传计划里来统一研究和安排，定期地讨论和审查文艺活动的计划，也及时解决开展文艺活动的一些必要的条件，积极地领导文艺活动的开展，结果，在这个规模并不大的厂里，职工的文化生活比许多大型厂都好得多。而在太原交通工厂，由于领导人员不但不积极支持，反而消极限制，认为搞文化活动占时间，“影响生产”，说剧团“乱七八糟”，说搞文艺活动的工人是“流氓意识”，说“把买篮球的钱投到生产上去就能起作用，用来买篮球是浪费”，结果厂里就长时期没有文化生活，职工的生产情绪也就受到影响。这难道不是很明显的对比吗？
    加强工矿文化工作的领导，除了从思想上应该认识到工矿文化工作是在日常生活中向职工群众进行政治教育、培植共产主义道德品质、满足职工文化需要、抵制和克服资产阶级思想侵蚀的一项重要的政治工作以外，另一个重要的方面，是要把工矿文化工作纳入国家计划的轨道。我们的各级政府文化部门和厂矿领导人员应该认识到：工矿文化工作是国家整个文化事业的一个重要组成部分，它同国家整个建设事业的发展是分不开的。过去虽然一再强调要加强工矿文化工作的计划性，但是，这方面的改进还是不大。许多地方，还是把“计划性”仅仅看作是本地区、本厂职工文艺活动项目的安排，日程的布置，经费的使用等等，而没有从更大的方面来着眼，把工矿文化事业逐步地纳入国家计划的轨道。这次的指示中指出，目前工矿文化工作中的主要问题和缺点之一是：“政府文化部门和工会组织在思想上还没有充分认识到工会系统的文化事业作为国家整个文化事业一个组成部分的深刻意义，因而严重地缺乏统筹安排的思想和措施；工会系统文化事业发展的计划性很不强，并一般缺乏有效的管理，设备的利用率不高；工矿文化工作的方针政策贯彻得还很不够，有些政府文化部门和文化事业单位为工人服务的思想还比较薄弱，对工会系统文化事业的辅导和支持很不够，甚至对他们漠视或加以限制；也有些工会组织和工会干部对文化工作的重要性、特别是对职工业余文化艺术活动的重要性认识不足，放弃领导，或者有意无意中把文化活动和生产对立起来。”逐步地把工矿文化事业纳入国家计划的轨道，是克服上述缺点、进一步开展工矿文化工作的重要措施。
    把工矿文化事业纳入国家计划轨道的关键，就在于各级文化主管部门和工会组织必须执行毛泽东同志所指示的“全面规划，加强领导”的方针。工矿文化事业的建设，究竟应该怎样合理地发展？工会系统的文化经费应该怎样用在最需要的地方？现有的设备应该怎样充分利用、发挥潜力？工矿文化工作人员应该怎样有计划地培养？政府文化部门应该怎样加强对各项工矿文化事业的统一安排和计划管理？所有这些都应该有全面的规划。
    各级政府文化部门和工会组织的领导人员首先要做到心中有数，对本地区重要厂矿、工地、企业的数字、类型和职工业余文艺活动中的主要情况和问题应该有所了解；对现有的力量、文化事业的发展和使用计划，对各个文化事业单位为厂矿、工地服务的计划、辅导和培养干部的计划、向工厂供应文艺材料的计划等等，应该进行深入的、全面的调查，作全面考虑和统一安排；对所属事业单位，要明确规定它们的具体方针和任务。另一方面，厂矿的党组织和行政领导人员必须重视职工业余文艺活动，把对于职工业余文艺活动的领导列入议事日程，帮助工会解决时间、场所、经费等等具体困难，指定负责的部门，定期检查工会的文化工作。
    根据第一个五年计划的规定，我国工人职员的总数，将要达到两千五百二十四万人。这样多的职工群众，是建设社会主义的中坚力量。怎样更好地满足他们迅速增长的文化要求，并且通过文化艺术这一有力的工具不断提高他们的阶级自觉、培养他们的共产主义思想品质、鼓舞他们的生产热情、使他们为祖国社会主义工业化的伟大事业作出更多的贡献，这是所有的工厂、矿山、企业中文化工作的崇高任务。
