    People's Democratic Countries' Care for the Working People
    Air Ambulance Station
    In a small village in Romania, the night was already deep. But the husband of Vila Braz, a resident of the village, was still anxiously staring out into the darkness. He kept thinking about the phone call that the village doctor had made to Bucharest earlier: "Hello! I'm calling from the Benisa Air Ambulance Station, Polita Village speaking! Can you hear me? Please send an obstetrician quickly, there is a difficult birth here!"
    After a while, an ambulance plane with a red cross painted on it brought Dr. Galab from Bucharest to the village. After a timely operation, the mother was out of danger, and her baby was born with a cry.
    Air ambulance work like this began nine years ago. Its purpose is to rescue critically ill patients who are far from the city. Over the years, Romania's air ambulance work has been greatly developed. In 1954 alone, the flying medical teams dispatched by the air ambulance station treated more than 1,200 critically ill patients. The number of times doctors went to all parts of the country for consultation has increased six times compared with 1949, and the amount of medicine used has doubled. In this year, the ambulance plane flew a total of 70,000 kilometers.
      Night Sanatorium
    Budapest, the capital of Hungary, will set up a night sanatorium for railway workers with eighty beds. The purpose of this sanatorium is to accommodate people whose health is not good, but who are still able to work as usual. After finishing a day's work, the sanatorium residents will be able to rest comfortably here every night, and receive medical and dietary care.
    Happy Old Age
    Near Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, in a place with beautiful scenery, there is a rest home for the elderly. One hundred and thirty-five elderly people who have lost their ability to work or who are homeless after the war are happily spending their happy old age here.
    Every elderly person living here receives meticulous care from nurses, and their daily lives are arranged to be very comfortable and convenient. Laundry rooms and barbers are always at their service, and doctors come to check their health every two weeks. In addition, every month they can watch three or four artistic performances in their own rest home hall or in various theaters in Berlin.
    Guests often come to visit here, and sometimes the elderly people also go out to visit or stay in their relatives' homes for a period of time.
      Farmer's Hospital
    In Slivnitsa Village, the largest village in the suburbs of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, a new rural hospital, one of the best in the country, has recently been built.
    The new hospital was built with funds from the Sofia Suburban People's Committee. Villagers and residents of nearby villages also actively participated in the construction work, and agricultural production cooperatives also provided bricks and tiles.
    The hospital has three internal medicine departments, a dental department, a natural therapy room, as well as operating rooms, surgical departments, obstetrics departments, as well as maternity and child health counseling centers and laboratories.
    This hospital is equipped with the latest medical equipment. It will serve more than 15,000 villagers and nearby workers and farmers.

    人民民主国家对劳动人民的关怀
    航空救护站
    在罗马尼亚的一个小村庄里，夜已经很深了。但是本村的居民维拉·布拉兹的丈夫却仍是焦急地凝视着窗外的黑夜。他不时地在想着刚才乡村医生打给布加勒斯特的电话：“喂！我要本尼萨航空救护站，波里塔村在讲话！听见了吗？请赶快派一个产科医生来，这里有难产啊！”
    过了一会，一架涂有红十字的救护飞机把医师加拉伯从布加勒斯特送到了这里。在及时地动了手术以后，产妇脱离了险境，她的婴儿也呱呱坠地了。
    像这样的航空救护工作是在九年以前开始实行的。其目的是为了救护离城市较远的危急病人。几年来，罗马尼亚的航空救护工作已经得到了很大的发展。只在一九五四年一年内，航空救护站所派出的飞行医疗队就治好了一千二百多个重病患者。医生到全国各地出诊的次数已比一九四九年增加了六倍，所使用的药品增加了一倍。在这一年里，救护飞机总共飞行了七万公里。
      夜间疗养院
    匈牙利首都布达佩斯将设立一个设有八十个床位的铁路工人夜间疗养院。这个疗养院的目的是接待那些虽然身体的健康情况不好，但还是能够照常工作的人们。疗养者在一天工作完了以后，每晚将可在这里安适地休息，并获得医疗和饮食上的照顾。
    幸福的晚年
    德意志民主共和国首都柏林近郊一个风景优美的地方，有一所老人休养所。一百三十五个因丧失了劳动力或在战后无家可归的老人，在这里愉快地度着他们幸福的晚年。
    住在这里的每一个老人都受到护士的无微不至的照顾，他们的日常生活也被安排得十分舒适便利。洗衣房和理发师经常为他们服务，医生每隔两个星期来检查一下他们的健康情况。此外，每一个月他们还能够在自己休养所的大厅或柏林各剧院里观看三、四次艺术表演。
    这里经常有客人前来访问，同时老年的休养者们有时也到外面去访问或是在他们自己的亲戚家里住上一个时期。
      农民的医院
    在保加利亚首都索非亚郊区的一个最大的农村——斯里夫尼查村里，最近建成了一所全国最好的农村医院。
    新的医院是由索非亚郊区人民委员会拨款兴建的。村里和附近的乡村居民们也都积极地参加了建筑工作，农业生产合作社还提供了砖瓦。
    在医院里设有三个内科室，一个牙科室，一个天然疗养室，还有手术室、外科室和产科室，以及妇婴卫生谘询处和化验室。
    这所医院设有最新式的医疗设备。它将为一万五千多个本村居民和附近的工人、农民服务。
