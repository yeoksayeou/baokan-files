Goa is an inseparable part of the Indian continent, the land where the Indian people live and work. Thousands of years before the Portuguese colonialists entered the Indian Ocean, Goa was already the Goa of the Indian people. In the early 16th century, Portuguese colonialists occupied Goa, but for more than 400 years, the land of Goa has been irrigated by the blood and sweat of the Indian people. The Indians living in Goa have always maintained the language, customs, religion, and culture of the Indian nation, and they constitute the absolute majority of the entire Goan population.

At the end of the 15th century, the commodity economy bred by Western European feudal society had developed. At that time, the Western European ruling class, which relied solely on exploiting the blood and sweat of others for their own squandering, increasingly greedily thought about pursuing gold and wealth overseas. China and India, which were rumored to possess endless treasures, naturally became the targets of their dreams of plunder. It was for this purpose that the Portuguese royal dignitaries in the 15th century constantly organized expeditions to hunt West African residents, inquire about coastal routes, and finally "discovered" the Cape of Good Hope, finding the gateway to the Indian Ocean.

Goa was forcibly occupied by Afonso de Albuquerque, the second so-called "Governor of India" sent to India by the Portuguese king. In the early 16th century, Albuquerque, upon entering the Indian Ocean, slashed and killed all the way. The Portuguese colonial fleet twice attacked Calicut, a commercial center city on the west coast of India, recklessly robbing and killing. After retreating from Calicut, they proceeded to attack Goa.

In the 15th century, Goa was the leading commercial center on the west coast of India, second only to Calicut, especially the concentration point for the import of Arab horses into India and the entry and exit of Indian pilgrims to Mecca. It possessed excellent harbors and was of extreme military importance. In Albuquerque's words, it was impossible to control India without taking Goa.

In the spring of 1510, Albuquerque seized Goa while the Goan officials responsible for defending the land were away on patrol. In May of the same year, the Portuguese colonial troops were forced to retreat under the brave resistance of the local military and civilians, but in November they once again captured this commercially and militarily important city with fierce artillery fire. The cruelty of the Portuguese colonialists at that time can be seen from Albuquerque's report to the Portuguese king on December 22, 1510: "In the battle to capture Goa and its affiliated fortresses, we succeeded unexpectedly. We killed three hundred Turks on the spot, and many other enemies drowned while trying to escape across the river. After that, I destroyed the city and killed everyone. For four whole days, we spared no Mappila... The Mappila we killed, men and women, totaled more than six thousand."

After the Portuguese colonialists occupied Goa, they turned Goa into a base for aggression against the East.

At that time, the Portuguese colonial policy in the East was to concentrate on activities that required the least effort but yielded the greatest profit, mainly robbing merchant ships, selling slaves, and monopolizing trade. For this purpose, the Portuguese colonialists built a series of seaside fortresses in East Africa, Arabia, Persia, India, Ceylon, Sumatra, the East Indies, the Philippines, and even China and Japan, as bases for their actions. The important hub of this series of bases was Goa. Goa was the administrative center of the Portuguese Eastern colonial empire, the residence of the so-called "Governor of India," and the seat of the highest judicial and religious institutions of all Portuguese colonies in the East.

During the height of Portuguese power, the Portuguese colonial fleet dominated the Indian Ocean, using Goa as its base. In the Indian Ocean, all merchant ships had to obtain permits from the Portuguese colonial authorities and pay tolls in order to pass through. According to estimates by Portuguese historians, the Portuguese king's annual income from the Eastern colonies at that time was one million Portuguese coins, of which customs revenue accounted for 330,000, tributes from small subordinate countries accounted for 200,000, and the rest was looted plunder. The wealth that Portuguese colonial officials pocketed privately was also one million Portuguese coins. From this estimate, it is not difficult to imagine what kind of activities the Portuguese colonialists were engaged in in Goa!

This is the historical truth of the Portuguese colonialists' occupation of Goa.

    葡萄牙殖民者是怎样侵占果阿的
    果阿是印度大陆不可分割的一部分，是印度人民劳动生息的园地。远在葡萄牙殖民者进入印度洋以前几千年，果阿就是印度人民的果阿了。十六世纪初叶，葡萄牙殖民者侵占了果阿，但是，四百多年以来，果阿的土地一直是依靠印度人民的血汗浇灌的，住在果阿的印度人一直保持印度民族的语言、风俗、宗教和文化，他们构成全部果阿人口的绝对多数。
    十五世纪末叶，西欧封建社会孕育的商品经济已经有了发展，当时专靠榨取别人血汗来供自己挥霍的西欧统治阶级就日益贪婪地想到海外追求黄金和财富。传说中拥有无穷财宝的中国和印度，很自然地成了他们梦寐以求的掠夺目标。正是为了这样目的，十五世纪葡萄牙的皇室显贵们才不断地组织探险队，有计划地捕猎西非居民，向他们打听沿海航路，最后“发现”了好望角，找到了进入印度洋的大门。
    果阿是被葡萄牙王派到印度来的第二任所谓“印度总督”阿尔布鸠克用武力强占去的。十六世纪初年，阿尔布鸠克一进入印度洋，就一路砍杀而来。葡萄牙殖民舰队曾两度进攻印度西海岸的商业中心城市科利库特，肆无忌惮地抢劫烧杀。退出科利库特后，接着就去攻击果阿。
    在十五世纪时，果阿是印度西岸仅次于科利库特的头等商业中心，特别是阿拉伯马输入印度和印度朝觐麦加香客的进出集中地点，拥有优良的海港，在军事上有其极重要的地位。用阿尔布鸠克的话说，不取果阿，要想控制印度是不可能的。
    一五一○年春，阿尔布鸠克趁果阿守土官员离开果阿出巡的机会，占领了果阿。同年五月，在当地军民的奋起抵抗下，葡萄牙殖民军队曾被迫撤退，但他们在十一月又再度用猛烈炮火攻占了这个在商业上、军事上都居于重要地位的城市。当时葡萄牙殖民者的残忍行为，从阿尔布鸠克在一五一○年十二月二十二日给葡萄牙王的报告中可以看出：“在攻取果阿及其所属要寨战役中，我们干得出乎意料地成功。我们就地杀死了三百个突厥人，另外有许多敌人在渡河逃跑时淹死了。在这之后，我就把这座城市加以毁灭，把每个人都杀死了。整整四天的时间里，我们没有放过一个马帕拉人……。被我们杀死的马帕拉人，男男女女，共在六千人以上。”
    葡萄牙殖民者侵占了果阿，就把果阿变为一个侵略东方的根据地。
    当时葡萄牙人在东方的殖民政策，是集中力量于出力最少而获利最厚的勾当，主要是抢劫商船、贩卖奴隶和垄断贸易。为了这样目的，葡萄牙殖民者在非洲东岸、阿拉伯、波斯、印度、锡兰、苏门答腊、东印度群岛、菲律宾乃至中国与日本，建造了一系列的海滨要寨，做为行动根据地。这一系列根据地的重要枢纽就是果阿。果阿是葡萄牙东方殖民帝国的行政首脑，即所谓“印度总督”的驻在地，也是葡萄牙东方一切殖民地最高司法机构和最高宗教机构的所在地。
    在葡萄牙极盛时代，葡萄牙殖民舰队横霸着印度洋面，就是以果阿为根据地。在印度洋上，一切商船都必须向葡萄牙殖民当局领取通行证，交出买路钱，方得通过。据葡萄牙历史家的估计，当时葡萄牙王每年从东方殖民地所攫取的收入凡百万葡币，其中关税收入三十三万，小属国的贡奉二十万，其余都是抢劫来的赃物。而葡萄牙殖民地官员饱入私囊的财富也有一百万葡币。从这估计，人们不难想像葡萄牙殖民者在果阿究竟干了些什么勾当！
    这就是葡萄牙殖民者侵占果阿的历史真相。
