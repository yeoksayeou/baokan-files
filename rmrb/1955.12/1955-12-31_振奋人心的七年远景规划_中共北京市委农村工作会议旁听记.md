Amidst this magnificent agricultural cooperativization movement, over ninety percent of the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing have joined agricultural production cooperatives. The suburban rural areas, having victoriously completed semi-socialist cooperativization, are brimming with vitality, and the farmers’ enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high. The new situation demands new arrangements for current work and comprehensive planning for future tasks. The recent Rural Work Conference of the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee effectively addressed this issue. The conference determined to shift the focus of work in the suburbs to rectifying and consolidating agricultural cooperatives and developing production, and established an inspiring seven-year perspective plan.

What Will the Beijing Suburbs Look Like in Seven Years?

If it were the winter of 1962, people walking into the suburbs of Beijing would see the following picture: Rows upon rows of greenhouses, with plump cucumbers, eggplants, and green peppers hanging from the vines. Warm vegetable cellars storing large quantities of Chinese cabbage, and cold frames where spinach and scallions bask quietly in the sun. At that time, the entire vegetable-growing area will be evergreen throughout the four seasons, and vegetable production will more than double, ensuring sufficient vegetable supply for the people of the capital. Power distribution lines will be interconnected in all directions, and farmers will use electricity for irrigation, threshing, milling, and processing agricultural and sideline products. In mountainous areas where electricity is not yet available, locomobiles and diesel engines will replace manual labor and animal power. In the spring, it will be even more beautiful. Countless tractors pulling various agricultural machines will be busy working in the vast fields. At that time, all the more than 600,000 mu of land in the suburbs suitable for mechanized farming will be cultivated by machines. The average grain yield per mu will reach more than 750 jin. In addition to self-sufficiency, suburban farmers can also supply the state with more than 160 million jin of grain. Every village will be filled with pigs and sheep in pens, chickens and ducks in coops, and ponds and lakes stocked with various kinds of fish. At that time, freshwater fish production will increase tenfold compared to now, and meat supply will also increase significantly. The mountainous areas will be covered with green trees and herds of cattle and sheep. The most striking feature will be the three-layered shelterbelts surrounding the city. The inner ring orchard belt, three kilometers wide and seventy kilometers long, in the near suburbs will have begun to mature. The middle ring shelterbelt, three kilometers wide and one hundred and thirty kilometers long, around the lower reaches of the Shahe and Liangshui Rivers and the upper reaches of the Fenghe River, will also be completed, with a large number of fruit trees planted within the belt. In the northern and western mountains, from Houerling through the Ming Tombs to Zhoukoudian, the barren mountains stretching for one hundred and fifty kilometers will be covered with young trees. The total afforestation area will reach more than two million mu. These shelterbelts will gradually take on the role of preventing wind and sand, regulating the air, protecting farmland, changing the dry climate of the capital in spring, and preventing soil erosion in mountainous areas. The roadsides, riverbanks, and surroundings of government offices, schools, and residential areas in the near suburbs will also be adorned with red and green, creating a pleasant scenery. This is what the Beijing suburbs will look like after the seven-year perspective plan is realized.

With a Plan, There is a Foundation

Wang Fuhai, the director of the Tiancun Agricultural Cooperative in Shijingshan District, said that their cooperative dug two wells in 1954 using electric water pumps. Because they only considered immediate convenience and did not have a long-term plan, they could have irrigated 200 mu of land, but because the location was not appropriate, they only irrigated 70 mu. He regretted, "This is the price of not having a plan." He also said, "Now that the Municipal Committee has formulated a seven-year perspective plan, it has given us a beautiful vision and clarified our goals. With a plan, there is a foundation, and our enthusiasm for developing production is even greater." Wang Fuhai's words expressed the feelings and will of many people. Inspired and enlightened by the seven-year plan, cadres from various districts, townships, and cooperatives participating in the conference all proposed or revised their own plans based on the overall requirements.

The Heping Agricultural Cooperative in the eastern suburbs, which focuses on grain production, is a large cooperative with more than 2,100 households and more than 20,000 mu of land. Based on their original experience with high-yielding corn varieties on the Guangying Cooperative, the entire cooperative plans to plant 8,000 mu of Baimaya corn next year, with an output of 450 jin per mu. In 1957, they aim to increase it to 550 jin, and after seven years, to reach 850 jin. The Si Ji Qing Agricultural Cooperative and the Yuanda and Jinzhuang Cooperatives in Haidian District, after merging, already have more than 650 greenhouses. They plan to expand to 1,000 greenhouses by 1956 and will also try using steam heating and reflective equipment to reduce vegetable production costs. By 1962, in addition to increasing the number of greenhouses and raising vegetable yields, they will also try using sun lamps to provide light for greenhouse seedlings at night, enabling them to grow rapidly. Most of the Shuangjiantzi Township in the western Beijing mining area consists of terraced slopes. Thanks to the farmers' organization and improved technology, the grain yield per mu in 1955 has reached 210 jin. Before this conference, they were already satisfied, thinking it was almost enough. After hearing the conference report, they realized that they were still far behind. They decided to adopt methods such as increasing fertilizer application and ensuring full stands to strive for an average grain yield of 280 jin per mu next year. Nan Shangwan Village has more than 3,000 mu of land, 80 percent of which is planted with fruit trees. In the past, farmers did not pay much attention to grain production. They said, "Planting a gourd yields only two ladles, there's no point in planting it." In the autumn of 1954, they established an agricultural cooperative and planted more than 200 mu of wheat, with an average yield of 130 jin per mu, and the highest yield exceeding 400 jin. Now, all the farmers in the township have joined the cooperative. The cooperative cadres proposed at the conference to plant 550 mu of wheat next year, with a yield of 200 jin per mu. To ensure increased production, they plan to apply urine fertilizer to 30 mu of high-yield land, striving for a yield of 500 jin per mu. To accumulate urine fertilizer, they bought 220 urine containers, one for each household, and collect them door-to-door by cart every morning, accumulating 1,000 jin of urine fertilizer every day.

Strong Support

The Municipal Planning Commission and various industrial departments solicited opinions from the directors of more than a dozen agricultural production cooperatives during the conference. The cooperative directors put forward more than ten kinds of urgently needed machines that they requested to be supplied. At first, they felt a little surprised, why do they suddenly want so many things? Upon further reflection, they realized that what they were thinking and doing could not keep up with the needs of agricultural cooperation development, so they must improve their work to catch up with the trend. To adapt to the needs of the objective situation, various relevant departments in Beijing have proposed or revised their plans to support the countryside.

The Beijing Municipal Road Engineering Bureau plans to build more than 200 kilometers of rural roads from 1956 to 1962, so that every township has roads, every cooperative is connected, and agricultural machinery can travel everywhere. In 1956, it will first build 68 kilometers of rural roads in the near suburbs and 65 kilometers of roads in the mountainous areas. The Municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Engineering Bureau is preparing to fully supply farmers with the feces, garbage, sewage discharged from sewers, and sludge excavated in the city next year. In areas within 14 li from each city gate, the feces and fertilizer collected daily will be delivered directly to the agricultural cooperatives. In areas beyond 14 li, fecal fertilizer supply stations will be established at appropriate locations, and the agricultural cooperatives will transport them themselves. In addition, ten garbage supply stations will be established to concentrate garbage and sludge for cooperatives to transport. Local industrial departments have also decided to produce more new agricultural tools to meet the needs of farmers.

The Electric Power Bureau, Telecommunications Bureau, and People's Broadcasting Station and other units proposed to support the electrification of suburban rural areas. According to their plan, every township in the entire suburbs will be equipped with a telephone in the spring of 1956. Within seven years, each district will be equipped with dispatch telephones and wired broadcasts. After the dispatch telephones are installed, the district can use them to direct production and transmit messages. Township cadre meetings can also be held. At that time, everyone will not have to carry their backpacks and run more than a dozen li. The meetings can be held while sitting at home. During the meeting, not only will the district speak and the township listen, but they can also discuss issues. If a township wants to speak, they just need to press the red button on the telephone, and a light on the district's switchboard will light up. The district closes the switch, and the township can speak, and all other townships can hear it. If a district-wide mass meeting is to be held, each township connects the telephone line to an amplifier, and the masses in the entire district can listen to the district's report.

Beijing is the capital of our great motherland. The rapidly changing appearance of the Beijing suburbs and the enthusiasm of the people of the Beijing suburbs for building socialism will encourage the people of the whole country to accelerate their march towards socialism.

    振奋人心的七年远景规划
    ——中共北京市委农村工作会议旁听记
    本报记者　周慧之
    在这次波澜壮阔的农业合作化运动中，北京市郊区已经有百分之九十以上的农民参加了农业生产合作社。胜利完成半社会主义合作化的郊区农村，到处呈现生气蓬勃的景象，农民的生产热情也空前高涨，新的形势要求对当前工作作新的安排，对今后任务作全面规划。中共北京市委最近召开的农村工作会议，很好地解决了这个问题。会上确定了把郊区的工作重心转入整顿、巩固农业合作社和发展生产，并且确定了振奋人心的七年远景规划。
    七年后的京郊是什么样
    如果现在是一九六二年的冬天，走进北京市郊区的人们就会看到这样一幅图景：一列列一排排的温室里，肥嫩的黄瓜、茄子、青椒挂满了枝藤，暖和的菜房里，储存着大批的大白菜，阳畦里，菠菜、小葱静静地晒着太阳。那时整个菜区都变成四季长青，蔬菜产量比现在增加一倍以上，保证供应首都人民足够的蔬菜。配电干线四通八达，农民们利用电力进行灌溉、脱粒、碾米和加工农、副产品。电力还供应不上的部分山区，也有锅驼机、柴油机等动力机械，代替人力畜力劳动。要是在春天那就更美丽了。数不清的拖拉机牵引各种农业机器，在大片的田野里忙碌地耕作，那时郊区可以机耕的六十多万亩土地全部使用机器耕作，每亩粮食平均产量将达到七百五十多斤，郊区农民除自给外，还可以供给国家一亿六千多万斤。各庄各村都是猪羊满圈，鸡鸭满栏，池塘湖坑放养着各种鱼类。那时淡水鱼产量将比现在增加十倍，肉类供应也将大大增加。山区都绿树成林，牛羊成群。最引人注意的是环绕市区的三层防护林带，宽三公里、长七十多公里的近郊内环果树林带已经开始成长，环沙河、凉水河下游，凤河上游附近，宽三公里长一百三十公里的中环防护林带也已完成，林带内栽植着大量果树。在北山、西山一带，从猴儿岭经十三陵直到周口店，长达一百五十公里的荒山上，也都小树丛生。造林总面积达二百多万亩。这些林带，将逐步担负起防止风沙、调节空气、保护农田、改变首都春季干燥气候和防止山区水土流失的作用。近郊的路旁、河边、机关学校和居民点的周围，也是红绿掩映，景色怡人。这就是七年远景规划实现后北京郊区的面貌。
      有了规划有了底
    石景山区田村农业合作社主任王福海讲到他们社在一九五四年打了两口利用电力车水的井，因为当时只顾眼前使用方便，没有长远打算，本来可以浇地二百亩，因为位置不适当，只浇地七十亩。他很惋惜地说：“这就是吃了没计划的亏”。他又说：“现在市委订了七年远景规划，使我们看到了美好远景，明确了奋斗目标，有了规划就有了底，我们发展生产的劲头也就更大了。”王福海的话表达了很多人的心情和意志，参加会议的各区、乡、社的干部，在七年规划的鼓舞和启发下，都根据总的要求，提出或修订了自己的计划。
    以生产粮食为主的东郊区和平农业合作社，是一个拥有两千一百多户人家，两万多亩土地的大社，他们根据原来广营社玉米丰产经验，全社明年计划种白马牙玉米八千亩，每亩产玉米四百五十斤。一九五七年要增加到五百五十斤，七年后要达到八百五十斤。海淀区四季青农业合作社和远大、金庄两社合并后，已有温室六百五十多间，他们计划到一九五六年要扩大到一千间，还要试用暖汽和反光设备以降低蔬菜生产成本。到一九六二年，除温室增加、蔬菜产量提高外，并且将试用太阳灯，使温室菜苗夜间也有光照，能够迅速成长。京西矿区双涧子乡大部是梯田坡地，由于农民组织起来改进了技术，一九五五年粮食产量每亩已经达二百一十斤。在这次会议以前，他们已经心满意足，认为差不多了，听了大会报告以后才知道还差得很多，他们决定采用增施肥料、保证全苗等办法，争取明年每亩平均产粮二百八十斤。南上万村有三千多亩土地，百分之八十种果树，过去农民很不重视粮食生产，他们说：“种一葫芦打两瓢，没啥种头。”一九五四年秋天办了农业合作社，种了二百多亩小麦，平均每亩产麦一百三十斤，最高产量四百多斤。现在全乡农民都入了社，社干部在会上提出明年要种小麦五百五十亩，每亩产麦二百斤。为了保证增产，他们计划除多锄多耙外，还准备在三十亩丰产地里试施尿肥，争取每亩产麦五百斤。为了积尿肥，他们买了二百二十个尿罐子，每户一个，早晨用大车挨户收集，每天可积尿肥一千斤。
      有力的支援
    市计划委员会和各工业部门在会议期间曾向十几个农业生产合作社主任征求意见，社主任们提出了十几种迫切需要的机器要求供应。最初他们觉得有些出乎意外，怎么一下就要这些东西呢？再一想，原来是自己所想的和所做的都赶不上农业合作化发展的需要了，因此必须改进工作赶上潮流才行。为了适应客观形势的需要，北京市各有关部门都提出或修改了支援农村的计划。
    北京市道路工程局计划从一九五六年到一九六二年，要修筑乡村道路二百多公里，使乡乡有路、社社相通、农业机械能到处行驶。一九五六年首先在近郊修建乡村道路六十八公里，山区修路六十五公里。上下水道工程局准备明年要把在城市收运的粪便、垃圾以及从下水道排出的污水、挖出的污泥，充分供给农民使用。在距离各城门十四华里以内地区，要把每日收运的粪肥直接送到农业合作社，十四里以外地区在适当地点建立粪便供应站，由农业合作社自行拉运。另外再建立十个垃圾供应站，集中垃圾、污泥，以便各社拉运。地方工业部门也决定要多生产新式农具，满足农民需要。
    电业局、电信局、人民广播电台等单位提出要支援郊区农村电气化。根据他们的计划，一九五六年春天，全郊区每乡都要安上电话机。七年内各区都要安装调度电话和有线广播。调度电话安好后，区里就可以用它来指挥生产，传达消息。还可以召开乡干部会，那时候大家就用不着背着背包跑上十几里路，坐在家里会就开起来了。开会的时候不光是区里讲话乡里听，还可以讨论，要发言的乡只要按几下电话机上的红扣，区里总机上的一个灯就亮起来，区里把这个开关一合，这个乡就可以发言，其他各乡都能听到。如果要开全区性的群众大会，各乡把电话线连到扩大器上，全区群众就能听区里的报告。
    北京是我们伟大祖国的首都，京郊面貌日新月异的变化，京郊人民建设社会主义的热情，将鼓舞全国人民加快向社会主义迈进。
