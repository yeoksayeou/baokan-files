Xinhua News Agency:

    The Chinese Academy of Sciences is establishing a number of scientific research institutions in the Northwest region. Among them, the Northwest Agricultural Biology Research Institute established in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, has been completed and has begun work. The Archaeological Research Office located in the suburbs of Xi'an and the Northwest Petroleum Research Office, Northwest Geological Research Office, Northwest Geophysics Research Office, and Northwest Veterinary Research Office located in Lanzhou will all be completed next year. The preparatory committee of the Northwest Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has begun to allocate personnel and purchase books and instruments.
    The main task of the Northwest Agricultural Biology Research Institute is to focus on soil and water conservation work in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and in combination with agricultural production, conduct comprehensive research on basic theoretical issues in biology, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. The Northwest Petroleum Research Office and the Northwest Geological Research Office will systematically study the oil extraction and refining in the Northwest region, as well as the oil-bearing structures and oil-bearing strata in the Hexi Corridor and the Qaidam Basin, respectively. The Northwest Veterinary Research Office will conduct research on the physiology and pathology of animal husbandry and livestock in the Northwest region.

    中国科学院在西北建立一批科学研究机构
    中国科学院正在西北地区建立一批科学研究机构，其中在陕西省武功县建立的西北农业生物研究所已经建成并且开始工作。设立在西安市郊的考古研究室和设立在兰州市的西北石油研究室、西北地质研究室、西北地球物理研究室、西北兽医研究室也将在明年全部建成。中国科学院西北分院筹备委员会已经开始调配人员和购置图书仪器。
    西北农业生物研究所的主要任务是以黄河中游水土保持工作为中心，结合农业生产，对生物、农业、林业、畜牧业等方面的基本理论问题进行综合性的研究。西北石油研究室和西北地质研究室将分别对西北地区的石油开采、炼制和对河西走廊、柴达木盆地的储油构造、含油层等问题有计划地进行研究。西北兽医研究室将对西北地区畜牧、家畜的生理、病理等问题进行研究。
