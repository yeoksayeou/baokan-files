    Actively Improving Production at the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory
    The construction of the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory began in March 1954. All the textile machinery and equipment in this factory are manufactured in our own country.
    Soon after the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory started operation, it not only completed all its production tasks according to plan, but also achieved considerable success in the reform of production technology. The weft waste of each yarn bobbin in the khaki cloth workshop has been reduced from more than ten yards to about one yard. This figure is not only lower than the state-stipulated target, but also better than the achievements of some old factories in various places in reducing weft waste. This experience was gained by Xu Shenggui, the deputy foreman of the khaki cloth workshop, who widened the tailing needle on the loom by one-third based on the production situation, reduced the vibration force of the shuttle head, and ensured that the fine yarn workshop supplied standard weft yarn. Since the comprehensive promotion of this method began on October 9th, the entire factory can save more than 5,000 kilograms of cotton yarn annually, which is equivalent to the amount of weft yarn used to weave more than 2,600 pieces of cloth.

    The scutcher in the opening and cleaning workshop is the first batch of new products manufactured in our country by imitating the latest Soviet-style scutcher. Each part of this scutcher can operate automatically, and the produced laps are particularly white and uniform. At the same time, it can also process and reuse the waste cotton from various workshops.

    积极提高生产的国营北京第二棉纺织厂
    国营北京第二棉纺织厂在一九五四年三月开始兴建。这个厂的全部纺织机器设备都是我国自己制造的。
    国营北京第二棉纺织厂开工不久，不仅按计划完成了全部生产任务，而且在生产技术的改革上获得了不少成绩。织布车间卡叽布间的每管纱的纬脚回丝已经从十码多减少到一码左右。这个数字不但比国家规定的指标低，而且比各地一些老厂减少纬脚回丝的成绩还好。这个经验是由卡叽布间副工长徐生贵根据生产情况，把织布机上的探尾针加宽三分之一，降低了梭头的震动力，以及细纱车间供应了合标准的纬纱而取得的。从十月九日开始全面推广这种方法，这样全厂每年就可以节约棉纱五千多公斤，相等于织二千六百多匹布所用纬纱的数量。　李大荣　金溵柱摄

    清花车间里的清花机，是我国仿照苏联最新型清花机式样制造的第一批新产品。这种清花机各个部分都能自动运转，生产的花卷特别洁白均匀，同时还能把各车间的回花加工后再使用。
