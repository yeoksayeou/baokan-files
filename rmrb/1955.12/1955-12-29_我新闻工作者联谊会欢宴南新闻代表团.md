Xinhua News Agency, December 28th. Deng Tuo, President of the All-China Journalists Association, held a banquet on the evening of the 28th to entertain the entire Yugoslav Journalists Delegation to China, headed by Pirpić. Milicevic, Counselor of the Yugoslav Embassy in China, was also invited to the banquet.

In his welcoming speech, Deng Tuo said: The Chinese people have a deep friendship with the Yugoslav people, and our struggles have been closely related for a long time. Every victory won by the Yugoslav people in the anti-fascist struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party has greatly inspired the Chinese people. The Chinese people highly appreciate the firm confidence and great efforts of the Yugoslav people in building socialism. The relationship between our Chinese and Yugoslav journalists is that of comrades, comrades-in-arms, and the most intimate friends among colleagues. Deng Tuo finally proposed a toast to the further consolidation and development of the friendship between the Chinese and Yugoslav peoples, to the friendship between Chinese and Yugoslav journalists, to the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism, and to the victory of Marxism-Leninism.

Pirpić then delivered a speech thanking them for their welcome. He said, we have a common feeling that we are living among comrades, comrades-in-arms, and close friends today. Pirpić said that long ago, when our party was underground, we read about the 25,000-li Long March and other materials of the Chinese revolutionary struggle. When our struggle was the most difficult, we learned from the Chinese revolution and applied these experiences. Our two countries, China and Yugoslavia, not only have historical ties, but also stand together in the struggle to further strive for peace, democracy, and socialism, and for a better future for mankind. He finally raised his glass to the friendship between the Chinese and Yugoslav peoples, to the friendship between Chinese and Yugoslav journalists, and to further achievements of China in socialist construction.

Attending tonight's reception were Wu Lengxi, Mei Yi, and Wang Yunsheng, Vice Presidents of the All-China Journalists Association, Gong Peng, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and more than 60 heads of news agencies and newspapers in Beijing.

    我新闻工作者联谊会欢宴南新闻代表团
    新华社二十八日讯　中国新闻工作者联谊会会长邓拓，二十八日晚上举行宴会，招待以皮尔皮奇为首的南斯拉夫新闻工作者访华代表团全体人员。南斯拉夫驻华大使馆参赞米里切维奇也应邀出席了宴会。
    邓拓在欢迎词中说：中国人民对南斯拉夫人民有着深厚的友谊，在过去很长时期中，我们的斗争都是密切相关的。南斯拉夫人民在共产党领导下在反法西斯斗争中取得的每一个胜利，曾经给中国人民以很大的鼓舞。中国人民对南斯拉夫人民建设社会主义的坚定信心和巨大努力给予极高的评价。我们中南两国新闻工作者相互之间的关系是同志、战友和同行间最知心的朋友。邓拓最后提议为中南两国人民的友谊更进一步的巩固和发展，为中南两国新闻工作者的友谊，为和平、民主和社会主义的胜利，为马克思列宁主义的胜利干杯。
    皮尔皮奇接着致词感谢对他们的欢迎，他说，我们有一个共同的感觉，我们今天是生活在同志、战友和知心朋友之中。皮尔皮奇说，很久以前，当我们党处在地下状态的时候，我们曾经读到中国革命斗争中二万五千里长征和其他的材料。当我们斗争最艰苦的时候，我们曾向中国革命学习，运用了这些经验。我们中南两国不仅有着历史的联系，而且在进一步争取和平、民主和社会主义，争取人类美好将来的斗争中，我们是站在一起的。他最后举杯祝中南两国人民的友谊，祝中南两国新闻工作者的友谊，祝中国在社会主义建设中取得进一步的成就。
