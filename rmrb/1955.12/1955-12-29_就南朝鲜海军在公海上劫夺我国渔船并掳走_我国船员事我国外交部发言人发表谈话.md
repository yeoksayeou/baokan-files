Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on December 28th regarding the South Korean navy's seizure and shooting of Chinese fishing boats and the abduction of Chinese fishing boat crew members in international waters:

　　At 3:30 AM on December 25, 1955, our fishing boat No. 51 was fishing in international waters at 34 degrees 15 minutes North latitude and 123 degrees 50 minutes East longitude, a fishing area where we regularly operate, when it was attacked by the South Korean Navy. South Korean soldiers forcibly boarded our fishing boat No. 51, abducted one of our fishing boat crew members, and attempted to seize the boat. When other nearby fishing boats rushed to rescue, the South Korean naval vessels fired upon our fishing boats. After our fishing boats were forced to take self-defense measures, the South Korean navy was compelled to abandon our fishing boat No. 51, but still abducted one crew member. The four South Korean soldiers who boarded our fishing boat No. 51 to carry out the seizure mission did not have time to escape and were taken back by our fishing fleet and are now under the custody of relevant Chinese authorities.

　　The South Korean Navy's seizure and attack on Chinese fishing boats in international waters and the abduction of a Chinese crew member violates the principles that all countries should jointly abide by in international waters. This is a serious provocative act against the People's Republic of China. The Chinese government lodges a strong protest against this. The South Korean authorities must immediately cease such provocative actions and prevent similar incidents from happening again. The South Korean authorities shall bear full responsibility for the December 25, 1955 incident.

　　The South Korean authorities must immediately return the Chinese fishing boat crew member they abducted to China. The Chinese government is prepared to return the four South Korean soldiers currently under the custody of relevant Chinese authorities to South Korea. The Chinese government awaits a response from the South Korean authorities.

    就南朝鲜海军在公海上劫夺我国渔船并掳走
    我国船员事我国外交部发言人发表谈话
    新华社二十八日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人十二月二十八日就南朝鲜海军在公海上劫夺和射击中国渔船、并且掳走中国渔船船员事发表谈话如下：
   一九五五年十二月二十五日三时三十分，我国五十一号渔船，在北纬三十四度十五分东经一百二十三度五十分我经常捕鱼的公海上捕鱼时，遭到南朝鲜海军的侵犯。南朝鲜水兵强行登上我五十一号渔船，掳走我国渔船船员一名，并且企图将该船劫走。当我临近的其他渔船赶往救援时，南朝鲜海军舰艇竟向我渔船射击。在我渔船被迫采取自卫措施后，南朝鲜海军才被迫放弃我五十一号渔船，但是仍然掳走了我五十一号渔船的船员一名。南朝鲜海军派上我五十一号渔船执行劫夺该船任务的四名水兵未及逃走，已由我捕鱼船队带回，现在中国有关机关的看管之下。
    南朝鲜海军在公海上劫夺和袭击中国渔船并且掳走一名中国船员，违背了各国在公海上应当共同遵守的原则，这是对中华人民共和国的严重挑衅行为。中国政府对此提出严重抗议。南朝鲜当局必须立即停止这种挑衅行为，防止再有类此事件发生。对于一九五五年十二月二十五日事件，南朝鲜当局应负完全责任。
    南朝鲜当局必须立即将它掳劫去的一名中国渔船船员送还中国。中国政府准备将现在中国有关机关看管下的四名南朝鲜水兵送还南朝鲜。中国政府等待南朝鲜当局的答复。
