To Strengthen the Transformation of Private Mechanical and Electrical Industries
Shanghai Decides to Establish Thirteen Specialized Companies
    In order to strengthen the transformation of the entire private mechanical and electrical industry and its economic reorganization, Shanghai has decided to establish thirteen specialized companies. The Petroleum Machinery Parts Manufacturing Company has already been established, and the remaining companies are actively preparing for their establishment. There are more than 4,800 local state-owned, joint state-private, and private mechanical and electrical factories in Shanghai. Private factories account for a large proportion and are scattered. Among them, more than 2,300 factories have 16 or fewer people, and about 1,000 have three or fewer people. Most of these private factories have simple equipment, backward technology, and complex product types, which cannot meet the growing needs of the country. In order to better coordinate production, improve the technical level of the mechanical and electrical industry, and manufacture new products needed by the state, it is necessary to carry out the transformation of the entire industry. After research, the Shanghai First Bureau of Heavy Industry, with the approval of higher authorities, decided to establish thirteen specialized companies according to the characteristics of the mechanical and electrical industry and the determined product direction. These companies are: Petroleum Machinery Parts, Internal Combustion Engine Parts, Power Equipment, Light Industrial Machinery, Machine Tools, General Machinery, Electrical Equipment, Rotary Motors, Textile Machinery, Forging and Casting, Tools, Bicycles, and Instruments. Factories of various economic types will be incorporated into the corresponding specialized companies. After the establishment of these thirteen specialized companies, they will be managed uniformly according to the nature of the products of each factory, and will be responsible for the production arrangement and economic reorganization of the entire industry. At the same time, in cooperation with relevant departments, they will strengthen political work and the education of workers and capitalists. The specialized companies will also strengthen the leadership of the factories that have already implemented joint state-private ownership, and urge them to continuously improve enterprise management and gradually reach the level of socialist enterprises. Since its establishment, the Petroleum Machinery Parts Manufacturing Company has organized more than 20 state-owned, joint state-private, and private machinery factories to specialize in the production of petroleum parts, which has strongly supported China's petroleum industry. Recently, the company has also assigned the 1956 petroleum parts production tasks to various factories. (Our correspondent in Shanghai)

    为加强对私营机电工业的改造  
    上海市决定建立十三个专业公司
    上海市为了加强对私营机电工业的全行业改造和经济改组工作，决定建立十三个专业公司。现在石油机械配件制造公司已经成立，其余各公司也都在积极进行筹备工作。上海市地方国营、公私合营和私营机电工厂共有四千八百多户，私营厂的比重大而分散，其中十六人以下的厂就有二千三百多户，三人以下的约有一千户。这些私营工厂大多数是设备简陋、技术落后、产品种类复杂，不能适应国家日益增长的需要。为了更好地统筹安排生产，提高机电工业的技术水平，制造国家需要的新产品，就必须进行全行业的改造。上海市第一重工业局经过研究后，按照机电行业的特点和已经确定制造的产品方向，提经上级批准，决定建立石油机械配件、内燃机配件、动力设备、轻工业机械、机床、通用机械、电器设备、旋转电机、纺织机械、铸锻、工具、自行车、仪表等十三个专业公司，把各种经济类型的工厂，分别纳入相应的专业公司。这十三个专业公司建立后，将根据各厂的产品性质统一管理起来，并且负责整个行业的生产安排和经济改组工作。同时配合有关部门，加强政治工作和对职工、资本家的教育。各专业公司还将对已经实行公私合营的工厂，加强领导，督促其不断改进企业管理，逐步达到社会主义性质企业的水平。石油机械配件制造公司成立以来，已经组织二十多家国营、公私合营和私营机器厂专业生产石油配件，有力地支援了我国石油工业。最近该公司又对各厂布置了一九五六年的石油配件生产任务。　（本报驻上海记者）
