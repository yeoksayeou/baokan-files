    Pasture by Qinghai Lake
    Dai Yaying
    On the grassland east of Qinghai Lake, 3,000 meters above sea level, there is a state-owned pasture with an area of more than 310,000 mu. Inside the pasture, streams flow gently, and wild grass grows to about a foot tall. Rows of clean, white sheep sheds and electric shearing rooms dot the green grassland. This is the famous Qinghai Lake Sanchaocheng Sheep Farm, a state-owned enterprise in Qinghai Province.
    Before liberation, this was the military livestock base of the bandit Ma Bufang. In 1951, the People's Government established the Qinghai Lake Sanchaocheng Sheep Farm here. At the beginning of its establishment, the sheep farm had only 1,027 heads of various livestock. Now it has developed to more than 25,000 heads. To ensure the supply of feed, the farm's tractors carried out land reclamation work on the grassland this autumn and will sow 7,000 mu of livestock feed next year. A large-scale water conservancy project, 40 li long, was also completed not long ago to ensure irrigation water for the feed base.
    In the past few years, the sheep farm has cultivated and bred a large number of fine-wool sheep, and has also carried out extensive cross-breeding of local Tibetan sheep with Caucasian Merino sheep and Xinjiang sheep. Currently, there are more than 12,000 first- to third-generation crossbred sheep. After reaching adulthood, each of these crossbred sheep can be shorn of 5.2 jin of wool, which is one to two times more than that of local Tibetan sheep. Moreover, the quality of the wool is also relatively high and can be used to weave high-grade wool fabrics such as gabardine.
    The sheep farm also frequently promotes improved varieties of crossbred sheep and fine-wool sheep to nearby herdsmen. In 1952 and 1953 alone, the sheep farm used Xinjiang sheep to breed more than 22,900 Tibetan sheep for the herdsmen. In the past few years, the sheep farm has supplied more than 400 purebred fine-wool rams to herdsmen in various counties for breeding, and has promoted more than 200 crossbred sheep to surrounding state-owned farms and herdsmen as breeding stock. This year, it also injected anthrax vaccine into more than 200 livestock nearby, and used horse-drawn machines to beat more than 10,000 jin of grass for the herdsmen. Nearby herdsmen also often come to the sheep farm to visit and learn. They have established a close friendship with the sheep farm.

    青海湖边的牧场
    戴亚英
    在青海湖东部拔海三千公尺的草原上，有一座面积达三十一万多亩的国营牧场。场内溪水缓流，野草长到一尺左右，一幢幢洁白的种羊舍、电气剪毛室点缀在绿色的草原上，这便是青海省著名的国营青海湖三角城羊场。
    解放前，这里是马匪步芳的军用役畜基地。一九五一年，人民政府在这里建立了国营青海湖三角羊场。羊场在初建时只有各类牲畜一千零二十七头，现在已发展到二万五千多头。为了保证饲料的供应，牧场的拖拉机今秋在草原上进行了拓荒工作，明年将播种七千亩牲畜饲料。不久前还修了一条长达四十华里的大型水利工程，保证了饲料基地的灌溉用水。
    几年来，羊场已培育和繁殖了大批的细毛种羊，并将当地的藏系羊和高加索美利奴羊、新疆羊大量进行杂交，目前培育出的一代至三代的杂种羊已有一万二千多只。这种杂种羊成年后每只可剪羊毛五点二斤，可比当地藏系羊多剪羊毛一倍到二倍，而且羊毛的质量也比较高，可以纺织哔叽等高级毛织品。
    羊场还经常向附近牧民推广良种的杂交羊和细毛羊。单是一九五二、一九五三两年中，羊场就用新疆羊替牧民配种了二万二千九百多只藏系羊。几年来，羊场已供应了四百多头纯种细毛公羊给各县牧民配种，将二百多头的杂交羊推广给周围国营农场和牧民作种畜。今年还替附近的二百多头牲口注射了炭疽病预防针，用马拉机替牧民打了一万多斤草，附近的牧民也经常来羊场参观学习，他们和羊场已建立了密切的友谊。
