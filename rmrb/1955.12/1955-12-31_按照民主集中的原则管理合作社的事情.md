Managing Cooperative Affairs According to the Principle of Democratic Centralism
He Cheng

Agricultural production cooperatives are organized by the laboring farmers together. Every member is a "master" and "owner." All affairs of the cooperative must of course be managed by all the members. With so many people together, who manages whom? If everyone is managing, won't there be chaos? If everyone wants to manage others and no one obeys, won't there be a complete breakdown? Indeed, without certain rules, a hundred monks chanting randomly will never finish the sutra; a hundred cooperative members running the house haphazardly will mean no one can actually run it. In this way, the cooperative cannot continue for even a day.

    The Members' Assembly

So, in the end, is "everyone managing" just empty words? Certainly not. The affairs of the cooperative must be managed by all the members. Management has a method; it's not chaotic. What's the method? The draft model charter for agricultural production cooperatives stipulates that the cooperative's charter and major issues should be discussed and approved by the members' assembly; if the majority of members agree and it's passed at the assembly, all members must follow the charter and any resolutions made. The members' assembly should also elect some members to form a management committee to manage cooperative affairs, and elect a cooperative director who represents the entire cooperative externally (of course, not randomly, but according to the opinions of all members) and also serves as the director of the management committee, leading the daily work of the cooperative. The cooperative director and the management committee must listen to the members' assembly. As long as the cooperative director and the management committee act according to the charter and the resolutions of the members' assembly, every member must also listen to them. If the cooperative director and the management committee don't do a good job or don't act according to the opinions of all members, what should be done? The members' assembly should also elect some members to form a supervisory committee to regularly supervise and inspect whether the cooperative director and the management committee are acting according to the charter and the resolutions of the members' assembly. If the cooperative director, management committee members, supervisory committee director, and members are not good, or were good but became bad, and it's truly impossible to continue, the members' assembly can also dismiss them from their positions. In this way, everyone manages, but it's not chaotic, which is called democratic centralism.

The draft model charter stipulates that the members' assembly is the highest management body of the agricultural production cooperative; that is to say, the members' assembly has the greatest power in the cooperative. Its most important functions are: (1) to adopt and amend the cooperative's charter; (2) to elect and dismiss the cooperative director, management committee members, supervisory committee director, and members; (3) to decide on the compensation for land and other major means of production contributed to the cooperative, the collection of share funds, and the distribution of annual income; (4) to review and approve the production plans and budgets (i.e., financial revenue and expenditure plans) proposed by the management committee, the quotas for various tasks, and the labor days (i.e., labor remuneration standards) that should be earned for various work quotas, and important contracts signed with external parties. The above are the most important matters in the cooperative, closely related to whether the cooperative is run well or poorly, and to the vital interests of each member. Expelling members is also a major matter. Therefore, when the members' assembly exercises these powers, at least two-thirds of the members must be present, and a resolution can only be made if more than half of the members present pass it, and the resolution is valid.

In addition, the members' assembly has several other functions. It must review and approve the work reports of the management committee and the supervisory committee (these work reports should be made periodically; the members' assembly must discuss whether their work during this period was done correctly, whether there were any incorrect aspects, and if it was completely correct, approve it. If there are incorrect aspects, but they have already pointed them out in the work report and made self-criticism, it can also be approved; otherwise, it must be revised before approval). New members joining the cooperative must also be approved at the members' assembly. The members' assembly must also decide on major rewards and major punishments for members. Other major matters in the cooperative, as long as everyone believes they need to be decided by the members' assembly, must be decided at the members' assembly. When exercising these powers, at least more than half of the members must be present, and the resolution can only be made if more than half of the members present pass it.

Who convenes the members' assembly? How often is it held? It is convened by the management committee, at least once per quarter. If it does not act according to this provision, it violates the charter, and the supervisory committee and the members can demand that it act according to the charter and convene the assembly.

Some cooperatives are very large, with too many members, and in some places the members live too scattered, making it difficult to hold a members' assembly. What should be done? The draft model charter stipulates that in this case, with the permission of the county-level people's committee, a members' representative assembly can be used instead of the members' assembly. How the representatives are elected and how many representatives are elected must also be approved by the county-level people's committee. Generally speaking, the number of representatives cannot be less than one hundred; this is to facilitate the reflection of the opinions of all members. The draft model charter also stipulates that when the members' representative assembly exercises the four most important powers mentioned earlier in place of the members' assembly, and when deciding to expel a member, it must be passed by two-thirds of all representatives to make a resolution; when exercising other powers in place of the members' assembly, it must be passed by more than half of all representatives to make a resolution. Because the members' representative assembly is, after all, not the members' assembly, in order to truly ensure that its resolutions conform to the opinions of the majority of members of the entire cooperative, it must be stipulated more strictly.

    The Management Committee

How many members should there be on the management committee? The draft model charter stipulates five to fifteen. Does the cooperative need a deputy director? If necessary, the management committee can elect one or several deputy directors to assist the director. The exact number of members and deputy directors each cooperative needs mainly depends on the size of the cooperative and the number of production undertakings it manages. If there's no need for so many, but some are elected just to accommodate the emotions of certain people, it won't benefit the cooperative. If that many are needed, but not enough are elected, it will be difficult to do things. Don't think that there are very few capable people; Chairman Mao said it very clearly: "Let them do it, and they will learn and grow in talent in the process of doing."

How does the management committee operate? This also needs rules. Otherwise, some things will be contested, many people will be giving orders randomly, and the members won't know who to listen to; or some things will be left unattended, with everyone pushing them onto others, and no one will know who is responsible. In some cooperatives, "the director handles everything single-handedly, the members of the committee don't handle anything, and the members are dissatisfied," and "the director is busy, the members of the committee watch; the director does, the members of the committee watch; the members are confused, and the cooperative is in chaos." This is certainly not good. So, what should be done? On the one hand, the management committee should meet to discuss things, and everyone should act according to the agreed-upon methods. On the other hand, the members of the management committee should have a good division of labor. The draft model charter stipulates that the members of the management committee can be divided according to agricultural production management, technical management, sideline production management, financial management, political work, cultural and welfare undertakings, and so on. Day-to-day work is led by the cooperative director, assisted by the deputy director. After the division of labor, who is in charge of what is clear, and the cooperative's affairs will not be chaotic or "forgetful."

Should the cooperative's accountant, cashier, custodian, technician, club manager, etc., also be elected by the members' assembly? According to the draft model charter, the management committee can appoint the cooperative's staff as needed. Generally speaking, these jobs require people with specialized talents; therefore, it is inconvenient and unnecessary to be elected by the members' assembly. Since the management committee is elected by the members' assembly, everyone can rest assured that the management committee will never appoint bad people. If the management committee really appoints bad people, there is still the supervisory committee to check, and the members' assembly can still make a resolution to ask it to correct itself.

The production team leaders and the production group leaders directly under the management committee are all staff members of the cooperative, and should also be appointed by the management committee; however, when appointing them, the consent of the team members and group members should be sought. The production group leaders under the production team should be designated by the production team leader. This kind of production group is generally a temporary organization, not a fixed one. Often, the group leader is designated first, and then the group members are determined, making it inconvenient for the group members to elect the group leader.

    The Supervisory Committee

How is the supervisory committee organized? How many members are needed? What do they do? The affairs of the supervisory committee are relatively simple, so it does not need as many people as the management committee. The draft model charter stipulates that the supervisory committee generally consists of three to nine members. The director of the supervisory committee is elected by the members' assembly. When necessary, the supervisory committee can elect one or two deputy directors to assist the director of the supervisory committee. When electing all the leaders of the cooperative, of course, people who are fair, capable, and actively working should be elected; when electing the director and members of the supervisory committee, even more attention should be paid to electing fair and impartial people. The supervisory committee is to supervise the cooperative director and the management committee members to act in accordance with the charter and the resolutions of the members' assembly, to periodically check whether the cooperative's financial revenues and expenditures are correct, and whether there are any cases of embezzlement, theft, damage, waste, or loss of the cooperative's public property. It can make suggestions to the management committee at any time, and should also report its work to the members' assembly periodically. Because the supervisory committee is to do such things, it should be elected by the members' assembly and not be under the control of the cooperative director and the management committee. The cooperative director, management committee members, accountant, cashier, and custodian cannot hold positions in the supervisory committee concurrently. The reason is clear: how can others believe in self-supervision and self-inspection?

Many agricultural production cooperatives only have a general "cooperative affairs committee," which mainly does the work of the management committee, with one or two members in charge of supervision work. This puts the people doing supervision work under the cooperative director; as members of the cooperative affairs committee, they also have certain responsibilities for the overall management of cooperative affairs. In this way, supervision work will certainly not be done well. There are also many cooperatives that have no one in charge of supervision work at all, which is even worse. The supervisory committee should be established in accordance with the provisions of the draft model charter.

Once you become the cooperative director, a member of the management committee, or the director or member of the supervisory committee, can you continue to be in that position forever? According to the draft model charter, these personnel must be re-elected every year. If the work is done well and the members still elect the original person, they can continue to be in that position, and should continue to be in that position, undertaking the glorious task of serving the entire cooperative and serving socialism.

    Absorbing All Types of Members into Leadership Positions

When electing leaders and appointing staff, attention should be paid to taking care of all types of members. First of all, it should conform to the fundamental principle of "relying on poor peasants and consolidating the unity of middle peasants" (when there is no distinction between poor peasants and middle peasants, this principle will, of course, no longer apply). As cooperatives expand, everyone should pay attention to electing fair, capable, and enthusiastic activists from among the new members during re-elections; the management committee should also pay attention to appointing them as staff members of the cooperative (as the cooperative grows, the number of members and staff should also be appropriately increased). If there are different ethnic components in the cooperative, members of each ethnic group should occupy an appropriate proportion in the leadership and staff. It should also be noted that women members should occupy a certain number of positions in the leadership and staff of the cooperative. Women are an indispensable force in agricultural production cooperatives, not only because they account for half of the population, but also because there are indeed many fair and capable talents among them. Only by fully developing the strength and wisdom of all members, including women, can agricultural production cooperatives truly be run well.

Members, let each of us more actively participate in the joint management of the cooperative's affairs! With such a good method as democratic centralism, no matter how many people there are in the cooperative, it will not be chaotic, and every member can contribute to the cooperative's "big affairs." We will surely be able to run the cooperative better and better!

    按照民主集中的原则管理合作社的事情
    何成
    农业生产合作社是劳动农民大伙儿组织起来的，每一个社员都是“东家”，都是“主人翁”，社里的一切事情当然得由社员大伙儿来管。那末多人在一起，谁管谁呢？你也管，我也管，他也管，岂不要乱碰头？谁也想管别人，谁也不服谁管，岂不要闹翻天？的确，如果没有一定的规矩，一百个和尚乱嚷嚷，经就念不成了；一百个社员乱当家，那就谁也当不了家。这样，合作社就一天也办不下去。
      社员大会
    那末，说来说去，“大伙儿来管”原来是一句空话？决不是的。合作社里的事情一定得叫社员大伙儿来管。管有个管法，不是乱管。怎么个管法？农业生产合作社示范章程草案上作了规定：合作社的社章和重大事情要开社员大会来讨论、通过；大多数社员都赞成，在大会上通过了的社章和别的作了决议的事，全体社员就都要照着办。社员大会还要选举一些社员组织成管理委员会，管理社务，选举一个社主任，一方面对外代表全社（当然不是随便代表，是按社员大伙儿的意见来代表）；一方面担任管理委员会主任，领导社里日常的工作。社主任和管理委员会必须听社员大会的话；只要社主任和管理委员会是按社章和社员大会的决议办事，每个社员也都要听他们的话。社主任和管理委员会如果不好好干，不照社员大伙儿的意见办事，怎么办？社员大会还要选举出来一些社员组织成监察委员会，经常监督和检查社主任和管理委员会是不是按社章和社员大会的决议办事。社主任、管理委员会委员、监察委员会主任和委员都不好或者本来好后来变坏了，实在不行，还可以开社员大会罢免他们的职务。这样，既是大伙儿来当家，又不是乱当家，这就叫做民主集中制。
    示范章程草案上规定：社员大会是农业生产合作社的最高管理机关；也就是说，社员大会在合作社里的权力最大。它的最主要的职权是：（一）通过和修改社章。（二）选举和罢免合作社主任、管理委员会委员、监察委员会主任和委员。（三）决定土地和别的主要生产资料入社的报酬、股份基金的征集、全年收入的分配。（四）审查和批准管理委员会所提出的生产计划和预算（就是财务收支计划）、各种工作的定额和各种工作定额所应得的劳动日（也就是劳动报酬标准）、对外签订的重要合同。以上这几种事情都是合作社里最重大的事情，跟合作社办好办坏、跟每个社员的切身利益都有密切的关系。还有开除社员，也是关系重大的事情。因此，社员大会在行使这几种职权的时候，必须有三分之二社员到会，到会社员过半数通过，才能作出决议，作出的决议才算数。
    此外，社员大会还有几种职权。它要审查和批准管理委员会和监察委员会的工作报告（这种工作报告要在一定时期作一次；社员大会要讨论他们这个时期的工作做得对不对，有没有不对的地方，完全对就批准，有不对的地方，如果他们在工作报告中已经指出来了，作了自我批评，也可以批准；不然，就要修改了才批准）。新社员入社也要在社员大会上通过。社员大会还要决定对于社员的重大奖励和重大处分。社里的别的重大事情，只要大家认为需要由社员大会决定的，都要在社员大会上决定。行使这些职权的时候，必须有过半数社员到会、到会的社员过半数通过，才能作出决议。
    社员大会由谁来召开？多长时间开一次？由管理委员会召开，每季至少开会一次。它不照这条规定办事，就是违背社章，监察委员会和社员们可以要求它照章办事，召开大会。
    有的合作社很大，社员太多，有些地方社员们住得太零散，开社员大会很困难，该怎么办？示范章程草案规定：在这种情况下，经过县级人民委员会许可，可以用社员代表大会代替社员大会。代表怎样选，选多少代表，也要经县级人民委员会批准。一般地说，代表人数不能少于一百名；这样才便于反映全体社员的意见。示范章程草案还规定：社员代表大会代替社员大会行使前边说的那四种最重要的职权的时候，以及决定开除社员的时候，必须有全体代表的三分之二通过，才能作出决议；代替社员大会行使别的职权的时候，必须有全体代表过半数通过，才能作出决议。因为社员代表大会毕竟不是社员大会，为了确实保证它的决议合乎全社大多数社员的意见，就不能不规定得更严格一些。
    管理委员会
    管理委员会里要有多少个委员？示范章程草案上规定的是五个到十五个。合作社还要不要副主任？如果需要，管理委员会可以推选一个或者几个副主任，协助主任办事。各个合作社究竟要多少委员、多少副主任，主要看社的大小和社里经营的生产事业的多少。如果不需要那么多，只是为了照顾某些人的情绪就多选一些，对全社的事情并没有好处。如果需要那么多，却不选够，也不好办事。不要觉得有本事的人很少；毛主席说得很明白：“要让他们做，在做的中间得到教训，增长才干。”
    管理委员会怎样办事？这也得有个规矩。不然，有些事争着管，许多人乱指挥，社员就不知道该听谁的话好；再不然，有些事没人管，你推给我，我推给你，不知道该谁负责任。在一些合作社里，“主任大包大揽，委员啥也不管，社员一旁不满”，“主任忙，委员闲；主任干，委员看；社员迷，社里乱”，这当然很不好。那该怎么办呢？一方面，管理委员会要开会商量，大家都按商量好的办法办事。另一方面，管理委员会委员要很好地分工。示范章程草案上规定：管理委员会的委员可以按照农业生产管理、技术管理、副业生产管理、财务管理、政治工作、文化福利事业等等事情来分工。日常工作由社主任领导，副主任协助。分工以后，谁管什么事，一清二白，社里的事情就不会乱了，也不会“丢三差四”的了。
    合作社里的会计员、出纳员、保管员、技术员、俱乐部管理员等等，是不是也要社员大会选举呢？按照示范章程草案规定，管理委员会可以按照需要任用合作社的工作人员。这些工作，一般地说要有专门才能的人才能够担任；所以不便也不必由社员大会选举。既然管理委员会是社员大会选举出来的，大家就可以放心，管理委员会决不能任用坏人。真发生了管理委员会任用坏人的情形，还有监察委员会可以检查，还有社员大会可以做出决议要它改正。
    生产队长和管理委员会直属的生产组长，都是合作社的工作人员，也要由管理委员会委派；不过，在委派的时候要征求队员、组员的同意。生产队下面的生产组长，应该由生产队长指定。这种生产组一般地说是临时的组织，不是固定的，往往是先指定了组长才确定组员，不便由组员选举组长。
    监察委员会
    监察委员会怎么组织？要几个委员？都干些什么事？监察委员会的事情比较简单，所以不需要像管理委员会那么多人。示范章程草案规定：监察委员会一般地由三个到九个委员组成。监察委员会主任由社员大会选举。在需要的时候，监察委员会可以推选一个到两个副主任，协助监察委员会主任办事。选举社里所有的领导人员，当然都应该选公道、能干、工作积极的人；选举监察委员会主任和委员，更要特别注意选举公正的铁面无私的人。监察委员会要监督合作社主任和管理委员会委员按照社章和社员大会决议办事，要按期检查合作社的财务收支是不是正确，社里的公共财产有没有被贪污、盗窃、破坏、浪费、损失的情形。它可以随时向管理委员会提意见，还应该按期向社员大会报告工作。因为监察委员会要做的是这样一些事情，所以，它应该由社员大会选举，并且不归社主任和管理委员会管，合作社主任、管理委员会委员、会计员、出纳员和保管员，都不能兼任监察委员会的职务。道理很明白：自己监督、检查自己，别人怎么能相信？
    有不少农业生产合作社只有一个笼统的“社务委员会”，它主要是做管理委员会的工作，里边有一两个委员管监察工作。这样做，就把做监察工作的人放在社主任下面了；他们既是社务委员，对全社的社务管理工作就也有一定责任。这样，监察工作一定做不好。还有不少合作社根本没有管监察工作的人，那就更不好了。应该按照示范章程草案的规定，把监察委员会建立起来。
    当了合作社主任和管理委员会委员、监察委员会主任和委员，是不是就可以一直当下去？按示范章程草案规定，这些人员，都要每年改选一次。工作做得好，社员仍然选原来的人，他们就可以再当下去，而且也应该再当下去，担负起为全合作社办事、为社会主义办事的光荣任务。
      吸收各类社员参加领导机构
    在选举领导人员和任用工作人员的时候，应该注意照顾到各种社员。首先，应当合乎“依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农”这一条根本原则（到没有贫农和中农的分别了的时候，这条原则当然也就没有作用了）。合作社扩大了，改选的时候，大家也要注意把新社员里面的公道、能干、热心为大家办事的积极分子选上；管理委员会也要注意任用他们做社里的工作人员（社大了，委员和工作人员的人数也应该适当地加多）。如果社里有不同的民族成份，各民族的社员在领导人员和工作人员里面应该占有适当的比例。还要注意，女社员在合作社的领导人员和工作人员里面应该占一定的名额。妇女在农业生产合作社里是不可忽视的力量，这不但是因为她们占人数的一半，而且在她们中间也的确有许多公道能干的人才。只有让包括妇女在内的全体社员的力量和智慧充分发挥出来，农业生产合作社才可能真正办好。
    社员们，每个人都更积极地来共同管理合作社的事情吧！有了民主集中制这样的好办法，社里人再多也不会乱，每个社员对社里的“大家务”都能用得上劲，我们一定能把合作社办得越来越好！
