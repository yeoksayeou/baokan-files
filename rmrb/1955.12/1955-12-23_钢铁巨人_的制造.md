    The Manufacture of "Steel Giants"
    Hao Jie
    On construction sites, we often see a towering iron structure, its iron arm extending several meters, lifting tons or even tens of tons of building materials from the ground and gently placing them in the designated location. In metallurgical, mechanical, and other industrial plants, we can also see a bridge-like iron frame with one or two hooks hanging in the middle. It can lift tons of metal materials or even tens of tons of furnace covers. People call various lifting equipment "steel giants."
    In the past, due to the backwardness of China's mechanical manufacturing industry, the construction of houses, the installation of machines, the transportation of materials, and the loading and unloading of goods from trains and ships were almost entirely done by manual labor, which was labor-intensive and inefficient. After liberation, with the development of economic construction, there were more and more large-scale new construction and reconstruction projects. Many large machine parts and building materials could no longer be moved and unloaded by manpower. In order to meet this growing new demand, China has successfully trial-produced many lifting equipment in recent years. For example, in order to use mechanized and industrialized construction methods to build tall factories and residences, the Beijing People's Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced a thirty-ton tower-type gantry crane last year. This crane can safely and quickly transport prefabricated floor slabs and wall panels weighing several tons to multi-story buildings for installation. Its 20-meter-long rotating lifting arm can flexibly transport various building materials within a high-altitude area of several hundred square meters. The fifty-ton bridge crane, an important handling machine indispensable for the development of metallurgy and machinery industries, has been successfully trial-produced by a certain factory. Its main hook can move workpieces weighing fifty tons to the designated location, moving on the steel beams of the workshop at a speed of 105 meters per minute longitudinally and 43.3 meters per minute laterally.
    The twenty-five-ton tower crane successfully trial-produced by the Shenyang Bridge Factory is indispensable for the construction of tall factory buildings. It can transport heavy components such as metal structure frames, large open-hearth furnaces, and iron-smelting furnaces from the ground to the designated installation position. Its 35-meter-long lifting arm can lift workpieces to a height of 71 meters above the ground, and it only takes more than three minutes to rotate a full circle. In order to meet the needs of railway bridge construction, China's mechanical manufacturing industry has also trial-produced giant cranes for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction project and cable cranes for the Donggang Yellow River Arch Bridge construction site on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway. The characteristics of these cranes are that they can lift high and transport far. The cable crane has two crane towers and a set of cables that can span the Yellow River. It can transport steel frames weighing several tons across the Yellow River to any place in the middle of the river.
    Through the manufacture of new products, China's lifting machinery manufacturing level has greatly developed. For example, the Dalian Lifting Machinery Factory, which is currently a large-scale manufacturer of lifting equipment in China, could only manufacture automobile parts, iron beds, and other machine parts in the early days of liberation, with only one small cupola furnace in the entire factory. In recent years, with the help of Soviet experts, after reconstruction, the factory has moved from manufacturing small bridge cranes with lifting capacities of 5 tons, 10 tons, and 15 tons to trial-producing bridge cranes of 20 tons and 30 tons, 25-ton semi-automatic cranes, 3-ton and 5-ton truck cranes, 5-ton electromagnetic cranes, and special specifications cranes such as "double 5-ton," "double 10-ton," and "double 20-ton." This year, they are also trial-producing more than 30 new products that are more precise, more complex, and larger, such as 75-ton bridge cranes, 36-ton cover-opening cranes, ash-cleaning cranes, and gantry cranes. The 75-ton bridge crane can lift 75 tons of parts at a time, which is equivalent to the labor of 1,500 people, assuming each person carries 50 kilograms. The ash-cleaning crane will be installed on the main railway line of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. When trains full of ore and steel pass by here, the ash-cleaning crane can quickly clean out the burnt coal from the locomotives through a large pipe. Its lifting capacity is 3 tons each time, which is dozens of times faster than manual ash removal. These new products will be trial-produced by the end of this year.
    During the first five-year plan, in order to ensure the needs of key project construction, China's mechanical manufacturing industry also plans to trial-produce lifting equipment such as port cranes, bridge-type magnetic material box cranes, electric grab cranes, Soviet-style new railway steam cranes, and 100-ton bridge cranes for assembling major components in heavy machinery factories, as well as dozens of lifting machines with different performance and uses. After these new products are manufactured, they will speed up China's construction speed. For example, port cranes are not only powerful assistants in the increasingly busy port ship unloading, which can speed up ship turnaround, but also can directly lift and transport the steel structure gates and concrete base columns of river dams in hydropower generation to the designated position for installation. In the fundamental treatment of the Yellow River flood and the development of the Yellow River water conservancy project, its effectiveness will be further发挥. (Attached photo)

    “钢铁巨人”的制造
    郝洁
    在建筑工地上，我们常常看到一种铁塔式的庞然大物，它的铁臂可以伸向几公尺以外，把地面上的几吨甚至几十吨重的建筑材料高高举起，然后轻轻放到指定的地方去。在冶炼、机械等工业厂房中，我们也可以看到一种桥式的铁架子，在这个架子的中间有一个或两个下垂的钩子，它可以把几吨重的金属材料，甚至几十吨重的炉盖吊起来。人们把各种起重设备叫做“钢铁巨人”。
    在过去，由于我国机械制造工业落后，无论是建筑房屋、安装机器、运输材料、火车和船舶装卸货物，几乎都是靠人力来进行的，劳动强度大，劳动效率低。解放后，随着经济建设事业的发展，规模宏大的新建和改建工程愈来愈多了，很多重大的机器零件和建筑材料再不能靠人力来搬运和装卸。为了适应这个日益增长的新要求，几年来，我国试制成功了不少的起重设备。例如，为了使用机械化、工厂化施工方法建筑高大的工厂和住宅，去年北京人民机器厂试制成功了一种三十吨塔式高架起重机。这种起重机可以把预制的好几吨重的地板和墙面安全而又迅速地运到多层建筑物上去安装。它的长达二十公尺能旋转的起重臂，可以在几百平方公尺的高空内灵活地运送各种建筑材料。发展冶金和机械工业不可缺少的重要搬运机械——五十吨桥式起重机已经由某厂试制成功。它的主钩可以把五十吨重的工作物，搬到指定地点，用每分钟纵行一百零五公尺、横行四十三点三公尺的速度在车间的钢梁上移动。
    沈阳桥梁厂试制成功的二十五吨塔式起重机，是建设高大的厂房必不可少的。它可以把金属结构的房架、大型平炉、炼铁炉等沉重的部件从地面送到指定安装的位置上。它的三十五公尺长的起重臂可以把工作物举起离地面七十一公尺的高空中，而且转一圈只需要三分多钟。为了适应铁路桥梁建设的需要，我国机械制造工业还试制了用于武汉长江大桥建设工程的巨型起重机和用于包兰铁路东岗黄河大拱桥工地上的缆索起重机。这些起重机的特点是吊得高、运得远。缆索起重机有两座起重塔和一套能够横跨黄河的缆索，它可以把几吨重的钢架，横过黄河上空，送到河心的任何地方去。
    通过新产品的制造，我国起重机械工业制造水平有了很大的发展。如目前我国规模较大的制造起重设备的大连起重机器厂，在解放初期，只能制造一些汽车配件、铁床和其它一些机器配件，全厂只有一台小化铁炉。几年来，这个厂在苏联专家的帮助下，经过改建，由制造一些起重量很小的如五吨、十吨、十五吨的桥式起重机，进而又试制了一些二十吨、三十吨的桥式起重机，二十五吨的半自动起重机，三吨和五吨汽车起重机，五吨电磁起重机，以及“双五吨”“双十吨”“双二十吨”等特殊规格起重机。今年他们又在试制七十五吨桥式起重机、三十六吨揭盖起重机、清灰起重机、龙门式起重机等三十多种更精密、更复杂、更庞大的新产品。七十五吨桥式起重机，每次可起重七十五吨重的部件，如以每人负重五十公斤计算，相当一千五百人的劳动量。清灰起重机将安装在鞍山钢铁公司的主要铁路专用线上。当满载矿石和钢材的火车经过这里的时候，清灰起重机就可通过一根大管子，把机车中已经烧过的煤炭迅速地清理出来。它的起重量每次为三吨，比人工清理炉灰快几十倍。这些新产品都将在今年年底试制完成。
    在第一个五年计划内，为了保证重点工程建设的需要，我国机械制造工业还准备试制的起重设备有港口起重机、桥式磁力料箱起重机、电动抓斗起重机、苏式新型铁路蒸汽起重机，以及为重型机器厂装配重大部件用的一百吨桥式起重机等数十种不同性能和用途的起重机械。这些新产品制成后，将加快我国的建设速度。如港口起重机不但是日益繁忙的港湾船舶卸货中的有力助手，可以加快船舶周转率，而且还可以把水力发电中的拦河坝的钢结构闸门和混凝土底柱直接吊运到指定的位置上去安装。在根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利工程中，它的效能将得到进一步的发挥。（附图片）
