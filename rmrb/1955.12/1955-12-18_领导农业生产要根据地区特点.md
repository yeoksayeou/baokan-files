    Leading Agricultural Production Should Be Based on Regional Characteristics
    Editor:
    Wengjiawan Township, Luotian County, Hubei Province, is a mountainous area. In recent years, the township Party branch's blind leadership of the masses in reclaiming mountain wasteland has caused serious man-made disasters.
    The mountain wasteland reclaimed in Wengjiawan Township is generally sandy steep slopes with a gradient of over 50 or 60 degrees, yielding very little benefit; however, every rainy season, it causes flash floods, washing large amounts of sand and gravel down the mountain and submerging farmland. For example, the seventh electoral district reclaimed 83 mu of mountain wasteland, resulting in the sedimentation from the reclaim submerging 135 mu of farmland at the foot of the mountain. According to preliminary statistics, over the past five years, more than 660 mu of farmland in the entire township have been submerged by sedimentation, resulting in an estimated reduction of more than 210,000 jin of grain; while the reclaimed wasteland has only yielded more than 22,000 jin of grain in the past five years. Farmer Nan Jinde said with dissatisfaction, "Reclaiming wasteland on the mountain increases production by one sheng, while sedimentation damages the fields below and reduces production by ten dan; it's really not worth it!" Because of blindly reclaiming wasteland on the mountain, the trees on the mountain have also been dug up, resulting in the land's inability to conserve water, which easily leads to drought and affects planting work.
    When making the overall production plan for the township recently, the Wengjiawan Township Party Branch of the Communist Party of China seriously reviewed the past mistake of blindly leading the masses to reclaim mountain wasteland; and submitted measures for handling this problem and plans for future production development to the township People's Congress. The plan stipulates that the guiding principle for developing agricultural production in the future is to strive to increase the yield per unit area and generally no longer expand the cultivated land area; according to the characteristics of the mountainous area, plant large quantities of pine, fir, tung, mulberry, and chestnut trees, and strive to eliminate barren mountains within five years and green the entire township within ten years. The measures for dealing with the already reclaimed wasteland are: land with good soil quality and a small slope can continue to be planted with crops, but should be built into terraced fields; general wasteland is prohibited from cultivation and trees should be planted immediately for afforestation. In order to prevent erosion of the already reclaimed wasteland, it was decided to build sand dams in the mountainside and gully mouths to store sedimentation. This plan has been supported by the farmers throughout the township.
    We should learn a lesson from the disaster caused by the blind reclamation of wasteland in Wengjiawan Township: we must lead agricultural production based on regional characteristics and in accordance with local conditions.

### 领导农业生产要根据地区特点

    领导农业生产要根据地区特点编辑同志：
    湖北省罗田县翁家垸乡是个山区。几年来，由于乡党支部盲目领导群众开垦山荒，造成了严重的人为灾害。
    翁家垸乡开垦的山荒地，一般都是五、六十度以上的沙质陡坡，收益很小；但是每到雨季却会引起山洪暴发，把大量的沙砾土冲下山去淹没农田。像第七选区开山荒八十三亩，结果流沙淹没了山脚下的一百三十五亩农田。据初步统计，全乡五年来被流沙淹没的农田六百六十多亩，估计少收粮食二十一万多斤；而开荒地五年来只收获了粮食二万二千多斤。农民南金德就不满地说：“山上开荒增产一升，山下压田减产十担，真是划算不来！”因为盲目在山上开荒，还把山上的树木都挖光了，结果使土地不能涵蓄水分，容易形成干旱，影响播种工作。
    中共翁家垸乡党支部在最近进行全乡生产规划的时候，严肃地检讨了过去盲目领导群众开垦山荒的错误；并且向乡人民代表大会提出了处理这个问题的措施和今后发展生产的计划。计划规定，今后发展农业生产的方针是：努力提高单位面积产量，一般不再扩大耕地面积；根据山区特点，大量种植松、杉、桐、桑、板栗树，争取在五年内消灭荒山，十年绿化全乡。对已经开垦的荒地的处理办法是：土质好而坡度小的可以继续种植农作物，但应当筑成梯田；一般荒地禁止耕种，立即栽树造林。为了防止已开荒地的冲刷，决定在山腰、沟口修建沙壋来储存流沙。这个计划得到全乡农民的拥护和支持。
    我们应该从翁家垸乡盲目开垦荒地而造成灾害的事情中吸取教训：必须根据地区特点，因地制宜地领导农业生产。
