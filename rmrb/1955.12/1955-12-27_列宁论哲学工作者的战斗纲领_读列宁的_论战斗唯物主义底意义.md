    Lenin on the Fighting Program of Philosophical Workers
    —Reading Lenin's "On the Significance of Militant Materialism"
    Xu Lin
      I
    Lenin's famous philosophical essay "On the Significance of Militant Materialism" was written for the magazine "Under the Banner of Marxism." At the beginning of the essay, Lenin said, "I would like to talk about a few issues that can define more precisely the content and program of the work announced by the editorial department of this magazine in the preface to the combined first and second issues." These issues are: to wage a relentless struggle against all kinds of idealism and clericalism, exposing their reactionary essence; to promote militant atheism; to study and elucidate dialectics from a materialist perspective and with examples from real life, answering the various questions raised by the latest revolutions in modern natural science; and in order to carry out the above tasks, militant materialists must form an alliance with non-Party materialists and advanced natural scientists.
    The militant "content and program of work" proposed by Lenin in the essay is not only a program of activity for a magazine, but also a program of activity for the entire Marxist theoretical front, especially the philosophical front. It put forward a fighting call against decadent bourgeois idealism and pointed out the path forward for Marxist philosophy under the conditions of the proletariat seizing power.
      II
    Lenin pointed out in his essay that if the magazine "Under the Banner of Marxism" wants to become a militant publication, it must first resolutely expose all modern "clerical servants with academic degrees" and "oppose that philosophical reaction, oppose the various philosophical prejudices held by the so-called 'intellectuals'." This means opposing all forms of idealism, opposing all philosophical reactions and prejudices, regardless of whether they are open or hidden, or what banners they fly or what signs they hang.
    Idealism is a distorted worldview, and it has always been an ideological tool used by reactionary classes to enslave the masses. The ideological representatives of the decaying bourgeoisie desperately cling to all the most reactionary doctrines of the past and present, cling to all kinds of obscurantism, revive medieval scholasticism, and desperately spread mysticism and religious superstition to save themselves from their death and to resist Marxism. The servants of the modern imperialist bourgeoisie use various decadent and reactionary philosophies, such as pragmatism, personalism, neo-realism, logical positivism, semantic philosophy, existentialism, etc., as their ideological weapons to attack materialism. American pragmatism, for example, defends the aggressive policies of American imperialism by denying objective reality and denying the objectivity of truth, and calling anything that can make a profit for the American imperialist bourgeoisie truth.
    The dialectical materialist worldview arose and developed in the struggle against all idealism. To promote dialectical materialism, it is necessary to expose and combat idealism. The founders of dialectical materialism, Marx and Engels, insisted on an irreconcilable struggle with idealism throughout their revolutionary activities. Lenin also consistently and tirelessly fought against idealism. In the difficult years of the Russian Revolution—the Stolypin period—Lenin wrote the famous "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," providing an outstanding example for Marxists around the world to oppose bourgeois idealism and defend Marxist materialism. Lenin's essay "On the Significance of Militant Materialism" is a continuation of the book "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," and a programmatic document against idealism under new historical conditions.
    "On the Significance of Militant Materialism" was written in 1922. At that time, the New Economic Policy had been implemented for a year, and Lenin announced that the retreat in the early stage of the New Economic Policy had achieved its goal, and now it was necessary to reconfigure forces and turn to an offensive against capitalism. Under this situation, the bourgeoisie strengthened its resistance in the political and economic fields, and also launched an offensive in the ideological field, using various reactionary theories to slander Marxism and defame the Soviet regime. Therefore, it was necessary to counterattack the various schools of bourgeois idealism and consolidate the Marxist ideological front. In addition, religious superstition still had a great influence among the working people at that time. Therefore, it was necessary to educate the people with militant materialism to ensure the victory of socialist construction. Lenin's essay played an extremely outstanding role in the struggle to complete the above tasks.
    The task that the Soviet ideological circles faced at that time is also the urgent task that our ideological circles face in the current socialist construction and socialist transformation, so Lenin's essay still has great guiding significance for us today.
    We know that around the May Fourth Movement, the scholars of the Chinese bourgeoisie and feudal comprador class once peddled the reactionary philosophy of the end of imperialism. For example, Hu Shi peddled the utilitarian philosophy of American imperialism, Zhang Junmai, Liang Shuming and others peddled Bergsonism, and others peddled Neo-Kantianism, Neo-Hegelianism, Machism, and so on. They used this reactionary idealism to attack the Marxist party's worldview—dialectical materialism and historical materialism. They used this reactionary philosophical viewpoint and method to distort and slander Chinese history and insult the Chinese revolution. The most reactionary elements among them, such as Hu Shi, tried their best to defend imperialist aggression. Since its establishment, our party has launched an irreconcilable struggle with these reactionary worldviews with the dialectical materialist worldview, and has achieved a great victory today. However, their remnants still need to be cleared. The current struggle against idealism has a new significance. It is a reflection of the "who will win" struggle in the socialist construction and socialist transformation on the ideological front. We know that dialectical materialism is the foundation of the party and the state's policies, a powerful weapon for raising the awareness of cadres and the broad masses of the people, and a guiding light for us to move towards socialism. Therefore, in order to resist socialist transformation and undermine socialist construction, the bourgeoisie will inevitably undermine the Marxist party's worldview—dialectical materialism. Therefore, the struggle against idealism and the promotion of materialism is a fundamental issue concerning the success or failure of the socialist revolution.
    From this, it can be seen how great the practical significance of Lenin's call against idealism in "On the Significance of Militant Materialism" has for our revolutionary practice today.
      III
    In connection with the task of opposing idealism, Lenin put forward the task of opposing the religious worldview and promoting militant atheism in the essay. Lenin wrote: "Secondly, such a magazine should be an organ of militant atheism. ... Therefore ... there is a great need for this magazine, which is determined to become an organ of militant materialism, to work hard to carry out atheistic propaganda and atheistic struggle." Proletarian militant atheism arises naturally from dialectical materialism. Lenin once pointed out that the Marxist line on the issue of religion is inseparably linked to the philosophical basis of Marxism. To fight against the idealistic religious worldview is a basic principle of Marxism.
    The idealistic religious worldview is a distorted worldview. It diverts people's correct understanding of the real world in the form of fantasy. It often deceives the working masses with the happiness of heaven, induces the working masses to be content with the status quo, and gives up the struggle against the exploiting classes. The idealistic religious worldview imprisons the will of the working people, shackles their spirit and wisdom, making them unable to see the bright future of reality, and willing to endure poverty and suffering. Religion conceals all the crimes of the exploiters from the working people. As Lenin said: "Religion teaches those who work and are impoverished all their lives to be obedient and patient in this world, while comforting them with the expectation of heavenly rewards. And for those who live on the labor of others, religion teaches them to do good deeds in this world, while very cheaply condoning their entire life of exploitation, cheaply selling them tickets to enjoy the happiness of heaven."
    Dialectical materialism has discovered the laws of the development of nature and society, and exposed the religious lie of "God creating things." Dialectical materialism enables the working people to realize that the creator of happiness is not God, but the hardworking and brave working people themselves. Dialectical materialism enables the working people to realize that the root of poverty and suffering is not "destiny," but the exploitation and oppression of the exploiting classes. The way to get rid of poverty and suffering depends on one's own struggle, and one cannot passively wait for "heaven in the afterlife."
    From this, it can be seen that it is necessary to vigorously promote militant atheism, gradually overcome people's religious superstition, thereby raising the awareness of the people, and giving play to the wisdom and creative spirit of the people, so that the people can consciously engage in socialist labor. However, the promotion of militant atheism does not exclude the people's freedom of belief, because religious superstitious ideas will continue to influence the consciousness of the people for a long time. Any coercion and rude behavior towards religion will undermine the unity of the people and weaken the strength of socialist construction. Therefore, we must be good at fighting against religious ideology. The materialist viewpoint should be used to explain the origin of religion and the social role of religion. Lenin pointed out: "Religion is one of the various forms of spiritual oppression that exist everywhere among the masses of people who are forever crushed by working for others, poverty, and loneliness. The weakness of the exploited class in the struggle against the exploiters will inevitably produce a belief in a beautiful afterlife, just as the weakness of the barbarians in the struggle against nature will produce a belief in God, demons, miracles, etc." In his article "The Attitude of the Workers' Party Towards Religion," Lenin particularly emphasized that the social root of the existence of religion in capitalist countries today is a fear of the blind forces of capital. Therefore, the task of promoting atheism should be subordinate to the task of the exploited masses opposing the exploiting classes.
    The promotion of atheism must make use of the living examples in socialist construction, and should also make use of the documents of the past militant atheism. Lenin wrote: "Various kinds of atheistic propaganda materials should be provided to these people, telling them various facts in actual life, influencing them in various ways, so as to arouse their interest, awaken them from religious dreams, and cheer them up in various ways from all aspects, etc." Lenin believed that, in accordance with Engels' instructions, the militant atheistic documents of the late eighteenth century should be translated and widely disseminated. Although many naive and unscientific things can be found in these documents, they can be abridged and appended with prefaces. Lenin believed that these "works with vigorous and vivid writing, unique genius, humorous and open attacks on popular clericalism" are still very valuable today. Of course, we should also improve the cultural and scientific knowledge of the people, such as promoting knowledge about the origin of the earth and life, and labor creates the world, etc., to correct people's incorrect religious concepts about nature and society, and help them establish a materialist worldview.
      IV
    In the essay, Lenin put forward the task of creatively developing Marxist philosophy by combining revolutionary practice and the latest achievements of natural science.
    Marxist philosophy is a creative doctrine, and it develops with the struggle of the proletariat and the entire social life and the development of science. Marxist philosophy provides scientific answers to the problems that arise in the process of the proletariat's struggle and in the development of social life and science, and at the same time enriches and develops Marxist philosophy itself. Lenin put forward the task of developing Marxist philosophy in this way in the essay. Lenin pointed out that it is necessary to explain Marxist philosophy, especially the study of Marxist dialectics, from all aspects in connection with political and economic relations and various examples in modern revolution based on the materialist viewpoint. At the same time, Lenin pointed out that it is necessary to help natural scientists answer the various questions raised in natural science. Lenin said:
  "If materialism does not undertake such a task and systematically implement it, then it cannot become militant materialism."
    The process of the emergence and development of natural science shows that the development of science is closely related to materialist philosophy. In the field of science, there is a struggle between materialism and idealism, dialectics and metaphysics. Idealism is hostile to science, and it hinders the development of science. Materialism is consistent with science, and it promotes the development of science. The consistency of materialism and science is determined by the nature of science. In his book "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," Lenin pointed out that science itself spontaneously produces materialism. However, Lenin also pointed out that this spontaneous materialist viewpoint has certain limitations, and it is not capable of resisting the erosion of idealism on science. Especially under capitalist conditions, natural scientists are influenced by the bourgeoisie in politics, economy, ideology and other aspects. Therefore, the following contradiction often occurs: a scientist is a spontaneous materialist in his own scientific research field, but when making theoretical generalizations about the achievements of natural science, he falls into the idealistic or religious worldview. Therefore, Lenin said in this essay: "Any natural science, any materialism, cannot withstand the attacks of bourgeois ideas and prevent the restoration of the bourgeois worldview without powerful philosophical arguments. In order to support this struggle, in order to carry out this struggle to the end and achieve complete victory, natural scientists must be modern materialists, conscious believers in the materialism represented by Marx, that is, they must be dialectical materialists."
    In the process of studying reality, in order to reach the essence from the phenomenon and reach the general from the individual, science must carry out theoretical thinking activities, that is, it must have a certain method of thinking and must be guided by a certain worldview. Philosophy provides science with the method of thinking and the worldview. Because of this, there is a struggle between two cosmologies—dialectics and metaphysics—in the field of science. Engels pointed out as early as in "Dialectics of Nature" that metaphysics has become an obstacle to the development of science, and dialectics has become an "absolutely necessary thing for natural science." It is precisely because natural scientists in capitalist countries have not mastered materialist dialectics that the latest achievements in natural science in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were used by reactionary thinkers to promote idealism. Lenin pointed out in the essay: "Precisely because modern natural science is encountering drastic changes, there are often large and small reactionary philosophical schools and philosophical trends." Therefore, Lenin emphasized: "Natural science is progressing very rapidly, and it is undergoing extremely profound revolutionary changes in all aspects, so philosophical conclusions are absolutely indispensable for natural science." He also said: "To pay attention to the various issues raised by the latest revolution in natural science and to absorb natural scientists to participate in this work carried out in philosophical magazines is an urgent task. If militant materialism does not solve this task, then it will fundamentally not be militant, and it will fundamentally not be materialism."
      V
    The above-mentioned tasks of opposing idealism and promoting militant atheism and expounding Marxist philosophy from all aspects are very difficult. This task cannot be successfully completed by relying solely on a few communist philosophers. Therefore, it is necessary to unite the broad non-Party materialists to jointly undertake this work. Lenin pointed out that "unless an alliance is formed with non-Communists in various activities, there can be no effective communist construction work." The same is true of the work of defending materialism and Marxism undertaken by the magazine "Under the Banner of Marxism." "In any case, there are still—and there will certainly be for a long time—some non-Communist materialists in our Russia. We must absolutely absorb all those who support thorough militant materialism to work together to oppose that philosophical reaction and the various philosophical prejudices held by the so-called 'intellectuals'."
    Secondly, in the struggle against idealism and the religious worldview, it is necessary not only to unite non-Party materialists, but also to unite advanced natural scientists. Lenin taught: "In order to carry out the work it should carry out, militant materialists must, in addition to forming an alliance with those thorough materialists who are not communists, also—and even more so—form an alliance with those representatives in modern natural science who tend to materialism and are not afraid to boldly defend and promote materialism against the philosophical tendencies of idealism and skepticism that are currently prevalent among the so-called 'intellectuals'."
    This alliance is necessary because idealism and the religious worldview are the enemies of science, and dialectical materialism is growing on the solid foundation of the achievements of modern natural science. Therefore, in order to more effectively expose the anti-scientific nature of idealism and the religious worldview, it is necessary to fully utilize the latest achievements of natural science and give them philosophical summary and generalization.
    "On the Significance of Militant Materialism" is Lenin's philosophical testament, which is especially important today. We must draw priceless treasures of thought from it and creatively realize Lenin's great revelation.

    列宁论哲学工作者的战斗纲领
    ——读列宁的“论战斗唯物主义底意义”
    徐琳
      一
    列宁的著名哲学论文“论战斗唯物主义底意义”，是给“在马克思主义旗帜下”杂志写的。列宁在论文一开头就说，“我想来谈谈的，是能把这杂志编辑部在第一二两期合刊发刊词中所宣布的那个工作底内容与纲领规定得更为精确的几个问题”。这几个问题就是：对一切形形色色的唯心主义、僧侣主义进行无情的斗争，揭露它们的反动实质；宣传战斗的无神主义；用唯物主义的观点和现实生活的实例来研究和阐明辩证法，回答现代自然科学方面最新革命所提出的种种问题；为了执行上述任务，战斗唯物主义者必须同非党的唯物主义者和先进的自然科学家结成联盟。
    列宁在论文中所提出的战斗性的“工作底内容与纲领”，不仅仅是一个杂志底活动纲领，而且也是整个马克思主义理论战线上、尤其是哲学战线上的活动纲领。它提出了反对腐朽资产阶级唯心主义的战斗号召，指明了在无产阶级夺取政权的条件下马克思主义哲学前进的道路。
      二
    列宁在论文中指出，“在马克思主义旗帜下”杂志要想成为战斗性的刊物，首先必须坚决揭露所有一切现代“僧侣手下拥有学位的仆役”，“反对那种哲学上的反动，反对所谓‘知识人士’所持的种种哲学偏见”。这就是说，要反对形形色色的唯心主义，反对一切哲学的反动和偏见，不管它们是公开的还是隐蔽的，是打什么样的旗帜和挂什么样的招牌。
    唯心主义是歪曲现实的世界观，历来是反动阶级用以奴役人民群众的思想工具。腐朽的资产阶级的思想代表拚命抓住过去和现在的一切最反动的学说，抓住各种蒙昧主义，复活中世纪的经院哲学，拚命散布神秘主义和宗教迷信来挽救它们的死亡，来对抗马克思主义。现代帝国主义资产阶级的仆役们用种种腐朽反动的哲学，例如实用主义、人格主义、新实在论、逻辑实证论、语义派哲学、存在主义等等，来作为他们的思想武器，向唯物主义进攻。美国的实用主义就是以否认客观实在，否认真理的客观性来为美帝国主义的侵略政策作辩护，把凡是能够替美帝国主义资产阶级获取利润的都叫做真理。
    辩证唯物主义世界观是在和一切唯心主义斗争中产生和发展起来的。要宣扬辩证唯物主义，就必须揭露和打击唯心主义。辩证唯物主义的创始者马克思恩格斯在其一生革命活动的过程中坚持了同唯心主义的不调和的斗争。列宁也始终不懈地进行了反对唯心主义的斗争。在俄国革命艰苦的年代——斯托雷平时期，列宁写了有名的“唯物主义与经验批判主义”，给世界马克思主义者作出了一个反对资产阶级唯心主义，捍卫马克思主义唯物主义的杰出范例。列宁的论文“论战斗唯物主义底意义”是
  “唯物主义与经验批判主义”一书的继续，是在新的历史条件下反对唯心主义的纲领性的文献。
      “论战斗唯物主义底意义”是一九二二年写成的，当时新经济政策已经施行了一年，列宁宣布：新经济政策初期的退却目的已经达到，现在需要重新配置力量转入对资本主义的进攻。在这种形势下，资产阶级在政治、经济领域中加强了反抗，在思想领域中也发动了进攻，他们利用各种形形色色的反动理论污蔑马克思主义，诽谤苏维埃政权。因此，必须对资产阶级唯心主义各种流派进行反击，巩固马克思主义思想阵地。另外，当时宗教迷信在劳动人民中还有很大的势力。因此，必须用战斗唯物主义教育人民，以保证社会主义建设的胜利。列宁底这篇论文在完成上述任务的斗争中，起了极其卓越的作用。
    苏联思想界当时所面临的这个任务，也是我国思想界在当前社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中面临的迫切任务，因此，列宁的论文对于我们今天来说，依然具有重大的指导意义。
    我们知道，在五四运动前后，中国资产阶级、封建买办阶级的学者们，曾经贩卖过帝国主义的末流的反动哲学。如胡适贩卖美帝国主义的御用哲学——实用主义，张君劢、梁漱溟等人贩卖柏格森主义，其他的人贩卖新康德主义新黑格尔主义马赫主义等等。他们用这种反动的唯心主义来攻击马克思主义政党世界观——辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。他们用这种反动的哲学观点和方法来曲解、诬蔑中国的历史，辱骂中国革命。他们之中最反动的分子如胡适竭力为帝国主义的侵略作辩护。我们党从成立之日起就以辩证唯物主义的世界观同这些反动的世界观展开了不调和的斗争，今天已取得了伟大的胜利。但是，它们的遗毒还需要继续清除。目前反对唯心主义的斗争具有着新的意义，它是社会主义建设和社会主义改造中“谁战胜谁”的斗争在思想战线的反映。我们知道，辩证唯物主义是党和国家政策的基础，是提高干部和广大人民群众觉悟程度的有力武器，是我们走向社会主义的指路明灯。所以，资产阶级为了抗拒社会主义改造、破坏社会主义的建设，必然要破坏马克思政党的世界观——辩证唯物主义。因此，反对唯心主义宣传唯物主义的斗争，是关乎社会主义革命成败的根本问题。
    由此可见，列宁在“论战斗唯物主义底意义”所发出的反对唯心主义的战斗号召，对我们今天革命实践，有着多么巨大的现实意义。
      三
    和反对唯心主义的任务相联系，列宁在论文中提出了反对宗教世界观，宣传战斗无神主义的任务。列宁写道：“其次，这样的杂志应该是个战斗无神主义的机关刊物。……所以……就万分需要这个立意成为战斗唯物主义机关刊物的杂志来努力进行无神主义的宣传，进行无神主义的斗争。”由辩证唯物主义中自然而然地产生出无产阶级的战斗无神主义。列宁曾经指出，马克思主义对待宗教这一问题的路线，和马克思主义哲学基础有着不可分离的联系。同唯心主义的宗教世界观作斗争，是马克思主义的起码原则。
    唯心主义的宗教世界观是歪曲现实的世界观，它以幻想形式转移人民对现实世界的正确认识，它往往以天堂的幸福哄骗劳动人民群众，引诱劳动人民群众安于现状，放弃反对剥削阶级的斗争。唯心主义宗教世界观禁锢了劳动人民的意志，束缚了他们的精神和智慧，使他们看不见现实的光明的前途，而甘于忍受贫困和痛苦。宗教在劳动人民面前掩饰了剥削者的一切罪行。正如列宁所说的：“宗教对一生工作和一生贫困的人，用现世生活中的顺从和忍耐来教训他，同时用期待天国的报偿来安慰他。而对依靠他人的劳动而生活的人，宗教就用现世生活中的行善来教训他，同时非常便宜地宽宥他们的整个剥削生活，廉价地卖给他们以享受天国幸福的门券。”
    辩证唯物主义发现了自然和社会的发展规律，揭破了“上帝造物”的宗教谎言。辩证唯物主义使劳动人民认识到幸福的创造者不是上帝，而是勤劳勇敢的劳动人民自己。辩证唯物主义使劳动人民认识到贫困、痛苦的根源不是“天命”，而是剥削阶级的剥削和压迫。摆脱贫困痛苦的道路要靠自己的斗争，不能消极等待“来世天堂”。
    由此可见，必须大力宣传战斗无神主义，逐步克服人们的宗教迷信，从而提高人民群众的觉悟，发挥人民群众的智慧和创造的精神，使人民群众能够自觉地从事社会主义的劳动。但是宣传战斗无神主义并不排斥人民的信仰自由，因为宗教迷信观念还会长期地影响着人民群众的意识，对宗教的任何强迫和粗暴的行为都会破坏人民群众的团结，都会削弱社会主义建设的力量。因此，必须善于同宗教意识形态作斗争。应该用唯物主义观点解释宗教产生的根源和宗教的社会作用。列宁指出：“宗教是各种精神压迫中的一种，这种精神压迫在被永远为别人工作、穷困和孤独所压溃的人民大众当中是到处存在着的。被剥削阶级在跟剥削者斗争时的软弱无力，必然会产生对优美的来世生活的信仰，正如野蛮人在跟大自然斗争时的软弱无力会产生对上帝、魔鬼、奇迹等的信仰一样。”列宁在“工人政党对宗教的态度”一文中特别强调指出，现在资本主义各国宗教存在的社会根源，就是对资本盲目势力的一种恐惧心理。因此，宣传无神主义的任务应当服从被剥削群众反对剥削阶级斗争的任务。
    宣传无神主义必须利用社会主义建设中活生生的实例，也应该利用过去的战斗无神主义的文献。列宁写道：“应该把各种各样的无神主义宣传材料供给这些民众，把实际生活方面各种各样的事实告诉他们，用各种各样的办法影响他们，借以引起他们的兴趣，把他们从宗教迷梦中唤醒过来，从各方面用各种方法使他们振奋起来等等。”列宁认为，应该遵照恩格斯的指示，把十八世纪末叶的战斗无神主义文献翻译出来，广为传布。虽然这些文献中可以找出许多幼稚和不科学的东西，但那是可以加以删节和附以跋文的。列宁认为这些“笔调遒劲生动，天才独到，诙谐而公开攻击流行僧侣主义的作品”，到今天还是很有价值的。当然，我们还应当提高人民群众文化、科学知识的水平，例如宣传地球和生命的起源、劳动创造世界等知识，以纠正人们关于自然和社会的不正确的宗教观念，帮助他们建立唯物主义世界观。
      四
    列宁在论文中提出了结合革命的实践和自然科学最新成就，创造性地发展马克思主义哲学的任务。
    马克思主义哲学是创造性的学说，它随着无产阶级斗争和全部社会生活以及科学的发展而发展。马克思主义哲学对无产阶级斗争进程中以及社会生活和科学发展中所发生的问题作出科学的回答，这同时也就丰富和发展了马克思主义哲学本身。列宁在论文中也正是这样提出了发展马克思主义哲学的任务。列宁指出，必须根据唯物主义观点联系政治、经济关系以及现代革命中的种种实例，从各方面阐明马克思主义哲学，特别是研究马克思主义辩证法。同时列宁又指出，要帮助自然科学家对自然科学中所提出的种种问题作出回答。列宁说：
  “唯物主义不把这样一个任务担负起来，并有系统地加以执行，那它便不能成为战斗性的唯物主义。”
    自然科学的产生和发展过程表明：科学的发展是和唯物主义哲学紧密相联系的。在科学领域中进行着唯物主义反对唯心主义，辩证法反对形而上学的斗争。唯心主义是同科学相敌对的，它阻碍科学的发展。唯物主义是同科学相一致的，它促进科学的发展。唯物主义同科学相一致乃是由于科学本性所决定的，列宁在“唯物主义与经验批判主义”一书指出，科学本身自发地产生唯物主义。但是，列宁同时指出，这种自发的唯物观点具有一定的局限性，它没有能力抵抗唯心主义对科学的侵蚀。特别是在资本主义条件下，自然科学家受着资产阶级政治，经济，思想上等各方面的影响，因此，常常发生这样的矛盾：一个科学家在自己的科学的研究领域中是一个自发的唯物主义者，而当对自然科学成就作出理论概括时，却陷入了唯心主义的或宗教的世界观。所以，列宁在这篇论文中说：“任何自然科学，任何唯物主义，若拿不出强有力的哲学上的论证，就抵挡不住资产阶级观念底攻击，也阻止不了资产阶级世界观底复辟。为要支持住这个斗争，为要把这个斗争进行到底而获得完全胜利，那末自然科学家就必须做一个现代的唯物主义者，做一个马克思所代表的唯物主义底自觉信徒，即必须做一个辩证唯物主义者。”
    科学在研究现实的过程中，为了要从现象达到本质，从个别达到一般，就必须进行理论的思维活动，也就是说必须要有一定的思维方法，必须依据一定的世界观的指导。哲学就是给科学提供了思维方法和世界观。正因为如此，在科学领域中进行着两种宇宙观——辩证法同形而上学——的斗争。恩格斯早在“自然辩证法”一书中指出，形而上学已成了科学发展的障碍，辩证法成了“自然科学绝对必需的东西”。正因为资本主义国家自然科学家没有掌握唯物辩证法，所以十九世纪末和二十世纪初，自然科学中的最新成就，被反动思想家利用了去宣传唯心主义。列宁在论文中指出：“正因为现代自然科学遭遇着急剧的变革，所以往往有大大小小的反动哲学学派和哲学流派发生。”因此，列宁强调说：“自然科学进步得十分迅速，在各方面受到极深刻的革命的改变，所以自然科学没有哲学的结论是绝对不行的。”他又说：“注视着自然科学方面最新革命所提出的种种问题，并吸收自然科学家来参加哲学杂志上所进行的这种工作，便是一个紧急的任务，战斗的唯物主义若不解决这个任务，那它就会根本不成其为战斗性的东西，就会根本不成其为唯物主义。”
      五
    上述反对唯心主义和宣传战斗的无神主义以及从各个方面阐明马克思主义哲学等任务，是十分艰难的，这个任务仅仅依靠少数共产党员哲学家是不可能胜利完成的，因此需要团结广大的非党的唯物主义者来共同担负这工作。列宁指出，“除非在各种各样的活动方面都与非共产党员结成联盟，便根本谈不到什么有成效的共产主义建设工作”。“在马克思主义旗帜下”杂志所担任的捍卫唯物主义和马克思主义的这一工作，也是如此。“无论如何，我们俄国总还有——且一定是很久还会有——一些非共产党员的唯物主义者，我们绝对应该吸收所有一切拥护彻底战斗唯物主义的人来共同努力工作，反对那种哲学上的反动，反对所谓‘知识人士’所持的种种哲学偏见。”
    其次，在反对唯心主义和宗教世界观的斗争中，不仅要团结非党的唯物主义者，而且要团结先进的自然科学家。列宁教导说：“战斗唯物主义者为要执行自己所应执行的工作，除了与那些不是共产党员的彻底唯物主义者成立联盟之外，同样还必须——甚至更加必须——同现代自然科学中那些趋向于唯物主义，不怕反对现时在所谓‘知识人士’中盛行的唯心主义及怀疑主义哲学倾向而大胆捍卫和宣传唯物主义的代表人物成立联盟。”
    这种联盟之所以必要，是因为唯心主义和宗教世界观是科学底敌人，而辩证唯物主义则是成长在现代自然科学成就的坚实的基础之上，因此，为了更有效地揭露唯心主义和宗教世界观底反科学性，必须充分利用自然科学的最新成就，并给予哲学上的总结和概括。
    “论战斗唯物主义底意义”是列宁的一篇哲学遗嘱，在今天尤其具有极其重要的意义，我们必须从其中吸取思想的无价宝藏，创造性地实现列宁的伟大照示。
