    We urgently need cultural and recreational activities

    To the Editor:

    Among the workers of our Longyan Iron Mine, there is a popular saying: "Work shifts are for drilling and blasting, after work it’s eating and sleeping!" This reflects how impoverished our cultural and recreational life is!

    The Longyan Iron Mine has a workers' club, which also shows movies from time to time; but workers have to cross several hills to get to this club, so it's difficult for everyone to go. There are also libraries or clubs at several mine entrances, but they have become places for meetings and studies, and rarely engage in any cultural and recreational activities. The mine's radio station also broadcasts some songs every day, but how can this alone satisfy the workers living in the deep mountains' demands for cultural and recreational activities?

    We are producing enthusiastically, and we urgently need cultural and recreational life! I believe that our legitimate demand should be met.

                      Longyan Iron Mine Worker, Hong Shi

    我们迫切需要文娱生活编辑同志：
    在我们龙烟铁矿的职工中，普遍流传着这样一句话：“上班打眼放炮，下班吃饭睡觉！”这反映了我们的文娱生活是多么贫乏！
    龙烟铁矿全矿有一个职工俱乐部，也经常放映电影；但是工人们到这个俱乐部去一次就要翻过几个山岗，所以大家很难得去。在几个坑口也有图书室或俱乐部，但是都成了开会和学习的地方，很少进行什么文娱活动。矿上的广播站每天也播送一些歌曲，但是单凭这个，怎么能满足生活在深山里的工人们对文娱活动的要求呢？
    我们在热情地生产，我们也迫切需要文娱生活！我认为，我们这个正当的要求是应该得到满足的。
