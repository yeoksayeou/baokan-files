To meet the needs of minority nationalities in creating writing systems, the Central Institute for Nationalities and other relevant units have made great progress in training ethnic minority language workers, translators, and teachers over the past four years.

    Since 1951, the Department of Languages at the Central Institute for Nationalities has successively opened classes in seventeen languages, including Tibetan, Mongolian, Uygur, Kazakh, Yi, Zhuang, Bouyei, Miao, Yao, Dong, Dai, Naxi, Lisu, Jingpo, Zaiwa, Kawa, and Lahu. To cooperate with the work of creating writing systems for the Zhuang and Miao ethnic groups, special training courses were also opened to recruit Zhuang and Miao students to train them as cadres for language research and the promotion of writing systems in these two regions. In order to further cultivate specialized talents in ethnic minority language research, research classes have also been opened, with both Han and minority students enrolled. Undergraduate students in the Department of Languages all go to ethnic minority areas for internships, and there have been thirty-two internship groups that have gone to places such as Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Hunan, and Tibet. The work of training cadres is combined with the work of investigation and research. The seven teaching and research groups set up by the Department of Languages at the Central Institute for Nationalities according to language family and the above-mentioned internship groups have also conducted investigations and research on related ethnic minority languages. A total of 628 students have attended the various classes in the Department of Languages. Apart from those who have already graduated and been transferred to work, there are still 496 students.

    In ethnic minority colleges and some universities in various regions, some ethnic minority language courses have also been opened, and research work has been carried out. The language work teams dispatched by the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to various ethnic minority areas have also been conducting investigation and research on the one hand, and training cadres on the other, and they have paid special attention to the work of training ethnic minority language cadres.

    培养民族语文干部工作有很大发展
    为了适应少数民族创造文字的需要，中央民族学院和其他有关单位，四年多以来在培养民族语文工作人员、翻译和教学人员的工作上，有了很大发展。
    从一九五一年起，中央民族学院语文系陆续开办了藏、蒙、维吾尔、哈萨克、彝、僮、布依、苗、瑶、侗、傣、纳西、傈僳、景颇、载瓦、佧瓦、拉祜等十七种语言的班次。为配合创立僮族和苗族的文字的工作，又开设了专修科，招收僮族和苗族学生，培养为这两个地区的语文研究和推行文字的干部。为进一步培养少数民族语言研究的专门人材，还开设了研究班，研究生中有汉族也有少数民族。语文系本科学生都到民族地区进行实习，先后到广西、贵州、四川、云南、新疆、湖南和西藏等处的实习组已经有三十二个。培养干部的工作是和调查研究的工作相结合的，中央民族学院语文系按照语言系属设立的七个教研组和上述实习组，对于有关民族语言也进行了调查研究。语文系各班学生先后计六百二十八人，除已经毕业和调工作的外，现在还有四百九十六人。
    在各地民族学院和一些高等学校中，也有开设一些少数民族语文课程并进行了研究工作的。中国科学院语言研究所派到各少数民族地区的语文工作队，也都一方面进行调查研究，一方面进行培养干部的工作，而且特别重视培养本民族语文干部的工作。
