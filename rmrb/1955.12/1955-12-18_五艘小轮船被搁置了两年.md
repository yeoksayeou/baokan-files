    Five Small Steamships Have Been Idle for Two Years
    To the Editor:
    In the Jiangsu Province Local State-Owned Changjiang Brick and Tile Factory, there are five small steamships that have been idle for nearly two years. In the past, the products of the Changjiang Brick and Tile Factory were always transported by ship, but since the beginning of last year, when they switched to train transportation, these five small steamships have been left idle on the riverbank. Up to now, one has sunk to the bottom of the river due to disrepair, and the remaining four have also suffered severe erosion and damage due to long-term exposure to wind and sun. In addition, the seventeen workers who were assigned to the ships have had nothing to do for a long time, and the factory has to pay a large sum in wages every month.
    The workers of this factory have repeatedly expressed their opinions, suggesting that these five small steamships be disposed of quickly. However, the problem has not been resolved, and it looks like these five small steamships will be idle until 1956!

    五艘小轮船被搁置了两年编辑同志：
    在江苏省地方国营长江砖瓦厂里，有五艘小轮船停了将近两年没有使用。过去长江砖瓦厂的产品一直用轮船运输，但是从去年年初改用火车运输后，这五艘小轮船就被搁置在江边了。到现在，有一艘因为年久失修已经沉落江底，其余四艘也因为长期风吹日晒而剥蚀损坏得很厉害。另外，随船的十七名工人长期以来没有事情可作，厂方每月还要支付一大笔工资。
    这个厂的工人们曾经多次提出意见，建议迅速处理这五艘小轮船。但是，问题一直没有解决，眼看这五艘小轮船又得搁置到一九五六年了！
