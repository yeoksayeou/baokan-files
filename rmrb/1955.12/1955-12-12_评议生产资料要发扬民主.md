　　After Donghe Township, Baise County, Guangxi Province, announced its land appraisal plan for joining the cooperative, most people did not offer any opinions because they were afraid of being labeled as selfish and not being approved to join the cooperative. 社员廖寿枝廖寿枝 (Sheyuan Liao Shouzhi) 社员廖寿枝 (Sheyuan Liao Shouzhi) stated that one of his plots of land was assessed at a lower grade, and he said: "What's the point of saying so much? I can make up for those ten or twenty catties of grain by working a few more days."

　　After the township branch understood the situation, it immediately held a meeting to study it, repeatedly promoted the policy of mutual benefit to the members, dispelled ideological concerns, and mobilized everyone to offer opinions, adopting correct opinions and explaining incorrect ones. For example, according to the opinions raised by everyone, the land appraisal of eighteen cooperative members in the Longchuan Agricultural Cooperative was unreasonable for eight households and was adjusted. 社员邓启先 (Sheyuan Deng Qixian) 社员邓启先 (Sheyuan Deng Qixian) originally had a plot of land with a fixed yield of 170 catties, which was later adjusted to 200 catties. 社员邓启辉 (Sheyuan Deng Qihui) 社员邓启辉 (Sheyuan Deng Qihui) had a plot of land with a fixed yield of 300 catties, which was later adjusted to 260 catties. After the adjustment, everyone was very satisfied and said, "This is fair and reasonable."

　　The appraisal of means of production is a meticulous and complex task, and it is also a central link in implementing the principle of mutual benefit. It is most closely related to the development and consolidation of cooperatives. To do this work well, we must fully promote democracy to achieve fairness and reasonableness and make everyone satisfied.

    评议生产资料要发扬民主
    广西省百色县东合乡公布入社土地评产方案以后，大多数人都不提意见，原因是怕说自己自私自利不批准入社。社员廖寿枝有一块田评低了一级，他说：“讲那多做什么，十几二十斤粮食我多出几天工就得了。”
  　乡支部了解这种情况后，立即开会进行了研究，分头向社员反复宣传互利政策，打破思想顾虑，发动大家提意见，对正确的意见加以采纳，对不正确的意见加以解释。如龙船农业合作社根据大家提的意见，全社十八户社员的土地评产，有八户评得不合理，进行了调整。社员邓启先有一块田原定产量一百七十斤，后调整为二百斤。邓启辉有一块地原定产量三百斤，后调整为二百六十斤。经过调整，大家都很满意，说：“这样就公平合理了。”
    评议生产资料是一件细致、复杂的工作，也是贯彻执行互利原则的中心环节。它同合作社的发展和巩固有最密切的关系。要做好这项工作，必须充分发扬民主，做到公平合理，人人满意。
