    In the Countryside During the High Tide of Cooperativization

    This Isn't a Dream
    Recently, the people of Sanlidi Village in Jin County, Liaoning Province, have had a common feeling: since Party Branch Secretary Wang Chengji studied Chairman Mao's report on agricultural cooperation, he often smiles and is even more motivated to work.

    One day, he stood in front of the village looking out at the fields. He looked and looked, his face becoming more and more happy.

    "Old Secretary, what are you looking at?" someone standing in front of him asked.

    "I'm looking at the picture of our village's happiness!" Old Wang replied with a smile.

    "Look!" Old Wang pointed to the front and back of the village, and excitedly talked about it: "Don't look at Benshan Mountain now, it's a bare barren mountain, in the future, we'll turn it into an orchard; in that mountain gully, we'll build a small reservoir; on the mountain, we'll graze herds of cattle and sheep; in the west of the village, the wasteland on both sides of the big river, we'll also turn it into a treasure pot in the future; in the north of the village, ... in the east of the village, ..."

    "Haha, the old secretary is dreaming in broad daylight!" someone said in disbelief.

    "This is not a dream. In three to five years, you will see it for real. You have all seen it with your own eyes, right? Our village has built three more cooperatives. We will soon realize semi-socialist cooperation. With cooperation, can't this picture become real?"
                                    (Tian Qian)

    The Heart of an Old Poor Peasant
    Hu Anting, a 73-year-old poor peasant, was both excited and annoyed when he heard that the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in his township (Hongguang Township, Qionglai County, Sichuan) was going to expand.

    He was excited because: this time he could join the cooperative.

    He was annoyed because: his son and daughter-in-law had gone to visit relatives, how could the whole family sign up?

    Fearing that people would say it wasn't "the whole family agreeing" and he wouldn't be able to sign up, he didn't sleep well all night. At the first crow of the rooster, he got up, leaned on his crutches, and was about to find his son and daughter-in-law to hurry back. Looking up, it was drizzling. He muttered to himself, "Even heavy rain can't stop my old man's whole family from joining the cooperative!" He walked in one breath to Taiping Township in Xinjin County, forty miles away, found his son and daughter-in-law at his daughter-in-law's home, and the family immediately happily rushed back.

    When he got home, the village registration had already ended. The old man was so anxious that he quarreled with his son and daughter-in-law: "Who told you to visit relatives at this time?"

    Hu Futing, a member of the Communist Youth League who lived next door, walked over with a smile and comforted the old man, "You go and talk to the cooperative director, you have the enthusiasm to join the cooperative, everyone won't refuse you."

    The old man didn't even bother to catch his breath and rushed to the cooperative director's house, panting.

    Of course, the old man's wish was fulfilled.
                                  (Zhang Tianjian)

    "National Unity Cooperative"
    Cooperatives unite farmers of different ethnic groups as closely as one family.

    Suoyishan Village in Guishan District, Lunan County, Yunnan Province, is a village where Sani and Han people live. The village has 150 households, 13 of which are Han Chinese and the rest are Sani.

    Before liberation, under the instigation of reactionary forces, the two ethnic groups discriminated against each other, and there was a great divide. They often fought, sued each other, and did not interact with each other. Even the children did not graze cattle together.

    After liberation, the farmers of the two ethnic groups jointly overthrew the landlord class, and the factors hindering ethnic unity were eliminated, but there were still certain boundaries between the two ethnic groups. Organizing mutual aid groups was also done separately.

    To run a cooperative, the farmers of the two ethnic groups must further unite. They said: In the past, the reactionary faction forcibly separated the two ethnic groups of farmers like a person's two hands; now we put these two hands together, and the strength will be greater. They jointly established a cooperative. In the cooperative, they taught and learned from each other, helped each other, made production better, and became more united.

    Every night, the youths of the two ethnic groups sang and danced together. Sani young men taught Han young men to play the bamboo flute and the sanxian; Sani young women taught Han young women to dance. Regardless of ethnicity, they all called the elders "Dad" and "Mom," and the younger ones "brothers" and "sisters," as intimately as one family. The Han people have all learned to speak the Sani language, and the Sani people can generally speak Chinese. They call their cooperative the "National Unity Cooperative."
                                    (Fa Chang)

    A Meeting No One Called
    Every night, farmers in Chengben Township, Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, gathered in groups of ten or eight in front of their doors. These small gatherings were not called by anyone. They got together spontaneously, discussing how to run cooperatives and how to increase production next year. The sixteen poor peasant households in Luqiao saw that the crops in the old cooperative were growing well, and were discussing "imitating it," and another seventeen households of farmers ran over and said: Let's do it together! The ten individual households in Xiaofengzhuang, upon hearing that a mutual aid group was talking about joining the cooperative, rushed over to inquire and request to join.

    The thirty-four farmers who had studied in the cooperative backbone training class in the county became the focus of people's attention after returning to their hometowns. Wherever they went, a crowd of people gathered to welcome them, asking them to talk about how to run the cooperative and Chairman Mao's instructions. When they returned home, people followed them home; their homes were crowded with people. Asking this, asking that, they talked with relish until late at night.

    They all still remembered that when the old cooperative set its production plan in March, they said that 80 mu of cotton should yield 16,000 jin of seed cotton, and everyone stared and said: bragging! bragging! As a result, these 80 mu of cotton fields yielded more than 19,000 jin of seed cotton. Yu Wenzao, an 75-year-old farmer, heard that the cotton in the cooperative was good, and went to the field to take a look, saying, "I have never seen cotton grow so well at my age!" The "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes grown in the cooperative weighed several kilograms each. The farmers outside the cooperative were surprised to see it and said: "It's so big, like a child's head!" They could not help but admire the cooperative.
    (Li Man)

    Cooperativization "Dissolved" Disputes
    With the development of the cooperative movement, inspired by the bright socialist future, farmers gradually got rid of conservative and narrow-minded ideas, and the historical disputes among farmers for many years were "dissolved."

    In Shizhen District, Wannian County, Jiangxi Province, 184 water conservancy disputes and 32 mountain and forest disputes have been resolved through mutual aid and cooperation.

    Chenjia Village and Houjia Village in Luojiahu Township in this district had fought 13 lawsuits and three armed battles before liberation to compete for water conservancy. After liberation, disputes still occurred in dry years. After the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, democratic consultations were conducted between the cooperatives, and 500 mu of land's water conservancy disputes were eliminated based on the spirit of benefiting production and benefiting unity.

    Zhulin Township and Huangdun Township in this county had irreconcilable grudges for water conservancy before liberation. In an anti-drought effort, key members of the cooperatives united after discussing together. The Dunxing Cooperative in Huangdun Township organized a water delivery team to help the Songgang Cooperative in Zhulin Township, saving 1,600 mu of late rice. The members of the Songgang Cooperative were greatly moved.

    在合作化高潮的农村里
    这不是做梦
    近来，辽宁省金县三十里村的人们都有一个共同的感觉：党支部书记王成吉同志自从学习了毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告以后，脸上经常带笑，工作劲头更大了。
    有一天，他站在村前向着原野眺望。望啊，望啊，脸上越来越显得高兴。
    “老支书，你在望什么呀？”站在他跟前的人问。
    “我在看咱们村的幸福图画哩！”老王笑着回答。
    “你们看！”老王指着村前村后，兴奋地谈了起来：“别看现在本山上是秃溜溜的荒山，将来咱叫它变成花果林；在那山沟里，修上一座小水库；山上，再放上成群的牛羊；村西，大河两岸的荒草原，将来咱也叫它变成聚宝盆；村北，……村东，……”
    “哈哈，老支书大白天在做梦呢！”有人不相信地说。
    “这可不是做梦。等个三五年，你们就可以看到实在的了。你们都亲眼看见了吧？咱村又建了三个社。很快就实现半社会主义的合作化了。合作化了，这图画还不能变成真的？”
                                    （田  潜）
    贫农老汉的心意
    七十三岁的贫农胡安廷，听说本乡（四川邛崃县红光乡）的红光农业生产合作社要扩大了，又兴奋，又懊恼。
    兴奋的是：这一次可以入社了。
    懊恼的是：儿子和媳妇走亲戚去了，怎样全家报名呢？
    他唯恐人家说不是“全家通”，不能报名，一夜也没有睡好觉。鸡叫头遍，他就起来，拄上拐杖，要去找儿子媳妇赶快回来。仰头一看，正落着毛毛雨。他自言自语地说：“再大的雨也挡不住我老汉全家入社！”他一气走到四十里外的新津县太平乡，在媳妇娘家找到了儿子和媳妇，一家人立即欢欢喜喜赶回来。
    到了家，村里报名已经结束了。急得老汉跟儿子、媳妇吵了起来：“哪个叫你们在这时候走亲戚？”
    隔壁住的青年团员胡福廷笑着走来，安慰老汉说：“你去对社主任谈谈，你有入社的热心，大家不会不要你。”
    老汉连歇气也顾不上，就气喘喘地赶到社主任家里去。
    当然，老汉的愿望达到了。
                                  （张天健）
    “民族团结社”
    合作社使不同民族的农民团结得亲如一家。
    云南省路南县圭山区蓑衣山村，是撒尼族和汉族居住的村子。全村一百五十户，有十三户汉族，其余都是撒尼族。
    解放前，在反动势力挑拨下，两族互相歧视，隔阂很大，常常打架、告状，互不往来，连小孩子都不在一块儿放牛。
    解放后，两族农民共同打倒了地主阶级，障碍民族团结的因素消灭了，但两族之间仍然有一定的界限。组织互助组，也是各组织各的。
    要办合作社，两族农民就必须进一步团结起来。他们说：我们两族农民过去就像一个人的一双手硬被反动派分开了；现在我们把这两只手合起来，力量就大了。他们一起办了一个合作社。在社里互教互学，互相帮助，把生产搞得更好了，也团结得更好了。
    每天晚上，两族青年就在一起唱歌跳舞。撒尼族男青年教汉族男青年吹竹笛，弹三弦；撒尼族女青年教汉族女青年跳舞。不分民族，都是见大的叫大爹、大妈，见小的叫弟弟妹妹，亲热得像一家人。汉族都学会了说撒尼话，撒尼族一般也能讲汉话了。他们把自己的合作社叫做“民族团结社”。
                                    （发  昌）
    没人召集的会议
    每天晚上，安徽省全椒县城本乡的农民，都十个八个的聚在门前。这些小小的聚会，没人召集。他们不约而同地凑在一起，你一句我一句地讨论着怎样办合作社，来年怎样增加生产。鲁桥的十六户贫农看了老社的庄稼长得好，正凑在一起商量“仿着办”，另有十七户农民就跑来说：我们一块儿办吧！小冯庄的十家单干户，听说有一个互助组说转社，就一齐跑来打听，要求参加。
    在县里的合作社骨干训练班学习过的三十四个农民回乡以后，成了人们注意的中心人物。他们到了哪里，哪里就聚起一堆人，欢迎他们，请他们讲怎样办社，讲毛主席的指示。他们回到家里，人们就跟到家里；在他们家里挤满了人。你问这，他问那，津津有味地一直谈到深夜。
    他们都还记得，三月间老社定生产计划的时候，说八十亩棉花要收籽棉一万六千斤，大家都瞪着眼说：吹牛！吹牛！结果，这八十亩棉田，摘了一万九千多斤籽棉。七十五岁的老农于文藻听说社里的棉花好，拄着拐棍下地看了一遍，说：“我这么大岁数也没见过棉花长这样好！”社里种的“胜利百号”甘薯，一棵都有好几斤重。社外的农民看了惊讶地说：“真大，跟小孩头一样！”他们不能不服气合作社了。    （李  曼）
    合作化“化”掉了纠纷
    随着合作化运动的发展，农民在社会主义光明前途的鼓舞下，逐渐摆脱了保守的狭隘的思想，农民内部多年的历史纠纷被“化”掉了。
    江西省万年县石镇区，通过互助合作解决的水利纠纷已有一百八十四件，解决的山林纠纷已有三十二件。
    这个区的罗家湖乡陈家村和侯家村，为了争夺水利，解放前打过十三场官司，进行过三次械斗。解放后，每逢旱年，仍然闹纠纷。建立农业生产合作社以后，社和社之间进行民主协商，本着有利生产、有利团结的精神，消除了五百多亩田的水利纠纷。
    这个县的株林乡和黄墩乡，在解放以前为争水利，结下了不可分解的冤仇。在一次抗旱中，社内骨干分子在一起商议了以后，团结了起来。黄墩乡的墩星社，组织送水队帮助株林乡松冈社，救活了一千六百亩晚稻。松冈社的社员大受感动。
