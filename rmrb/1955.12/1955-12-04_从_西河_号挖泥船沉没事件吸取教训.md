Learn a Lesson from the Sinking of the Dredger "Xihe"
Inspector of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhao Wenlong

    The "Xihe" dredger sinking case that occurred in December 1954 has been tried by the Tianjin Maritime Court, and the criminals Wang Baofu, Li Ruiting, and Liu Xiaoxian have been punished by the state law.
    The loss of state property caused by the sinking of the "Xihe" was huge. While the main perpetrators should be subject to the legal sanctions they deserve, the relevant departments such as the Tianjin Port Authority, Port Supervision, and Dredging Company should also draw necessary lessons from this event to improve their work. Through the inspection of the "Xihe" sinking incident, we found that there are many problems in the management of Tianjin's maritime transportation enterprises in terms of systems and labor discipline. The phenomenon of neglecting production safety is even more prominent. The idea of neglecting production safety exists to varying degrees from top to bottom, resulting in frequent accidents. According to the statistics of the Tianjin Dredging Team in 1954 alone, a total of 93 accidents of varying sizes occurred throughout the year, causing direct losses of more than 34,000 yuan to the state. Many of these accidents were caused by neglecting production safety. After the criminals Wang Baofu and Li Ruiting abandoned the "Xihe" in the sea and returned to Tianjin, the Tianjin Port Authority should have sent the large ship then moored in the port to rescue it as soon as possible, but because they were dominated by the idea of neglecting safety, they were afraid of affecting the unloading task and delayed the time. It was not until they realized that the "Xihe" was in a very dangerous situation that they allowed a large ship passing by to go to the rescue, but before it reached the scene of the accident, the "Xihe" had already mostly sunk and could not be rescued. The principle of safe production must be adhered to, and the policy of "safety for production, and production must be safe" must be implemented. However, some leading staff in the Tianjin maritime transportation enterprise departments, although they verbally understand the importance of safe production, still adopt the practice of opposing production and safety in specific work, seriously neglecting safe production. Some people also believe that the occurrence of accidents is due to unavoidable objective reasons and has little to do with safe production. Facts have proved that this idea is wrong. After the "Xihe" sinking incident, the Tianjin Dredging Team took safety production measures in many aspects, and various accidents have been significantly reduced. From January to November this year, work-related injuries decreased by 63.4% compared with the same period last year, and machine damage accidents decreased by 46%, which is a very good illustration.
    However, at present, safe production has not been universally paid attention to in the management of transportation enterprises. For example, the compasses of some ships are not accurate, which may cause route deviations and cause accidents in navigation; the boilers of some ships leak air and water, and no repairs have been made, which may cause explosions and mechanical damage accidents, and so on. All of this should be improved immediately and should not be delayed any longer.
    The "Xihe" sinking incident raised the issue of strengthening the role of port supervision and strictly enforcing the system. Before the "Meling" wheel towed the "Xihe" out to sea, the Yantai Port Supervision should have checked whether the outgoing ships met the navigation conditions in accordance with the regulations, but the Yantai Port Supervision did not seriously fulfill its responsibilities. The heavy mud bucket of the "Xihe" could have been removed to reduce the phenomenon of swaying from side to side during navigation, but since the port supervision did not check, it was impossible to discover this error. Strengthening the role of port supervision, from the current requirements and experience of employees, the leading organs of the transportation department should pay attention to consolidating the functions and powers of port supervision, so that they can truly play a role. Many systems in enterprise management were not strictly implemented in the past. For example, according to regulations, ships sailing at sea should make accurate nautical logs, but the ships sailing out of the Tianjin Dredging Team are very careless in implementing this system, and some ships do not make records at all. When investigating the cause of the "Xihe" sinking this time, studying when the "Meling" wheel encountered wind, when it encountered which island, and when it encountered other sailing wheels, all added a lot of trouble to the investigation of the truth because there were no records to check. More importantly, the lack of navigation records may lead to miscalculation of mileage in bad weather and affect the safety of ships. As for other aspects, such as unclear division of responsibilities, often "everyone is responsible and no one is responsible" in the work, and once an accident occurs, they shirk responsibility to each other, some captains and first mates sail without certificates in violation of regulations, some sea distance calculations are not accurate, and some dredging ships carry the families of workers, etc. All these chaotic phenomena in the work also contain the potential for accidents.
    This incident also exposed the lax labor discipline in the Tianjin maritime transportation department. It can be seen from the "Xihe" sinking incident that Wang Baofu, the acting captain of the "Meling" wheel, Li Ruiting, the navigator, and Liu Xiaoxian, the temporary person in charge of the Yantai work area, had disputes over the top-grade coal and first-grade coal. In the case of insufficient coal preparation, the "Meling" ventured to sail. When attacked by headwind, they did not actively take rescue measures, and easily abandoned the giant dredger carrying thirty-two crew members in the turbulent sea. The occurrence of this irresponsible criminal behavior against state property and the lives of the people is inseparable from the lax labor discipline among the crew members and workers of the Dredging Company on weekdays. In the past year, there were more than 100 criminal cases committed by the crew members and workers of this company due to non-compliance with labor discipline, and the losses caused to the state were also very large. However, the laxity of labor discipline has not attracted the attention of the relevant leaders, and they have not seriously conducted education on compliance with labor discipline for employees, and the handling of accidents that violate labor discipline is extremely unserious. This has fueled the development of this bad style. For example, some workers can be absent from work at will; some workers are lax in their own labor discipline, but they attack workers who abide by labor discipline; some counter-revolutionary elements mixed in the workers' ranks take the opportunity to make trouble, run amok, resist the execution of the captain's orders, and even openly beat people.
    From the inspection process of the "Xihe" sinking incident, it was found that the fundamental reason for the above-mentioned phenomenon is that the leading staff have insufficient understanding of the bad consequences of lax labor discipline. Some comrades in the Tanggu District Office of the North China Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union have also taken a compromising and conciliatory attitude towards some problems caused by lax labor discipline in the past, and have not conducted labor discipline education well, organizing crew members and workers to fight against bad tendencies and wrong behaviors. Accepting the lessons of this incident, the transportation enterprise management department and the North China Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union should further rectify labor discipline among crew members and workers and cadres. From the "Xihe" sinking incident, it can also be seen that some of the crew members of the Tianjin Dredging Team's outgoing ships lacked nautical knowledge, so once an accident occurred during navigation, they could not ask for help from passing ships. After the "Xihe" was abandoned by the "Meling" wheel, a large ship was found coming from the front that night. In order to ask for help, some crew members vaguely remembered that a red light should be hung (this is indeed a "danger" signal), but in order to express extreme danger, they hung another one (two red lights actually mean "our ship cannot be controlled"), and randomly sounded the whistle. In this way, the incoming ship found that there was an uncontrollable ship ahead, with an emergency whistle warning, afraid of a collision between the two ships, and drove away around the road, and the "Xihe" lost a chance to be rescued. It can be seen that the necessary technical knowledge of navigation is also very important for dredging crew members. However, according to crew members, the Tianjin Dredging Team's technical symposium is only held once or twice a month, for one hour each time, and sometimes it cannot be maintained, and it has actually become a mere formality. The sinking of the "Xihe" is an event with major lessons. Tianjin shipping and dredging departments must learn from it, take resolute measures, and improve their work in order to gradually eliminate marine accidents.

    从“西河”号挖泥船沉没事件吸取教训
    最高人民检察院检察员  赵文隆
    一九五四年十二月份发生的“西河”号挖泥船沉没案件已经由天津水上法院审理完毕，犯罪分子王宝福、李瑞亭和刘孝先，受到国家法律的制裁。
      “西河”号沉没事件给国家财产造成的损失是巨大的。事件的主要责任者固然应该受到应得的法律制裁，天津港务局、港务监督和疏浚公司等有关部门也应该从这一事件中得出必要的教训，以求改进工作。通过对“西河”号沉没事件的检查，我们发觉天津海上交通企业管理方面在制度上和劳动纪律上有着很多问题。忽视生产安全的现象更表现得比较突出。忽视生产安全的思想从上到下都不同程度地存在着，以致事故层出不穷。仅就天津疏浚队一九五四年的统计，全年共发生大小事故九十三起，给国家造成的直接损失达三万四千多元。这些事故许多都是由于忽视生产安全而造成的。犯罪分子王宝福、李瑞亭把“西河”号抛在海中回到天津以后，天津港务局方面本来应该及早派出当时停泊在港内的大船前去营救，但由于他们受忽视安全的思想支配，怕影响卸货任务，而耽误了时间。直到发觉“西河”号处境十分危急，才让过路的某艘大船前往营救，但还没有到达出事地点，“西河”号却已经大部沉没，没法施救了。安全生产的原则是必须坚持的，“安全为了生产，生产必须安全”的方针是必须贯彻执行的。但是天津海上交通企业部门某些领导工作人员，平时虽然口头上懂得安全生产的重要，在具体工作中却仍然采取生产和安全对立的作法，严重地忽视安全生产。也有人认为事故的发生是由于难以避免的客观原因，同安全生产关系不大。事实证明这种想法是不对的。“西河”号沉没事件发生以后，天津疏浚队在许多方面采取了安全生产的措施，各种事故就有显著减少，今年一月至十一月工伤事故比去年同一时期减少了百分之六十三点四，机损事故减少百分之四十六，就是一个很好的说明。
    但是在目前，安全生产在交通企业管理方面还没有普遍地加以注意。譬如有的船只的罗盘仪不精确，这在航海中就很可能发生航线偏差，造成事故；有的船只的锅炉漏气漏水，还没有设法修理，这就有可能发生爆炸和机件损坏事故，等等。这一切都应该立即设法改进，而不应该再拖延下去。
    “西河”号沉没事件提出了必须加强港务监督的作用以及严格执行制度的问题。“没凌”轮拖着“西河”号出海之前，烟台港务监督本应该照章检查出海船只是不是合乎航海条件，但是烟台港务监督并没有认真履行自己的职责。“西河”号的笨重的挖泥斗本来可以摘下，以减轻航行中左右摇摆的现象，但由于港务监督没有检查，就无从发觉这个错误。加强港务监督的作用，从目前职工群众的要求和经验来看，主要是交通部门的领导机关要注意巩固港务监督的职权，这样才能真正发挥作用。企业管理方面的许多制度，过去是执行得不严格的。例如按照规章规定，在海上航行的船只要作精确的航海日志，但天津疏浚队出海的船只对这一制度执行得非常马虎，有些船只根本不作记录。这次检查“西河”号沉没原因的时候，研究“没凌”轮什么时候遇风，什么时候遇见什么岛，什么时候遇见其他的航轮，都因为没有记录可查，这样就给追查事实真相增加了不少麻烦。而重要的是，航行没有记录，可能在恶劣的气候中计错里程而影响船只安全。至于其他方面，例如某些职责划分不清，常常在工作中“都负责又都不负责”，一旦出了事故就互相推诿，有的船长和大副没有证书而违章出海航行，有的海程计算不精确，有的疏浚船只载运工人家属等等，这些工作中的混乱现象，也都包藏着发生事故的祸机。
    这一事件也暴露了天津海上运输部门中劳动纪律的松懈。从“西河”号沉没事件中可以看出，“没凌”轮代理船长王宝福、领航员李瑞亭同烟台工区的临时负责人刘孝先为了上特号煤、一号煤发生争执，在备煤不足的情况下，“没凌”号就冒险开船，当遭到逆风袭击的时候，不积极采取求救措施，竟轻易地把载有三十二名船员的巨型挖泥船抛在波涛汹涌的大海里。这种对国家财产和人民生命不负责任的犯罪行为的发生，是同平日疏浚公司所属船员和工人中的劳动纪律松懈分不开的。去年一年中，这个公司的船员和职工因为不遵守劳动纪律而构成的犯罪案件就有一百多起，因此给国家造成的损失也是很大的。但劳动纪律松懈并没有引起有关领导方面的重视，没有认真向职工进行遵守劳动纪律的教育，对违犯劳动纪律的事故处理得极不严肃。这就助长了这种恶劣作风的发展。例如有的工人可以随意旷工；有的工人自己劳动纪律松懈，而又打击遵守劳动纪律的工人；混藏在工人队伍中的某些反革命分子更趁机捣乱，横行霸道，抗拒执行船长命令，甚至公开打人。
    从“西河”号沉没事件的检查过程中发现，产生上述现象的根本原因，是领导工作人员对劳动纪律松懈所产生的恶果认识不足。中国海员工会华北区委员会塘沽区办事处的某些同志对于因为劳动纪律松懈而发生的某些问题，过去也采取了迁就姑息的态度，而没有很好地进行劳动纪律的教育，组织船员和工人向不良倾向和错误行为进行斗争。接受这次事件的教训，交通企业管理部门和中国海员工会华北区委员会应该在船员和工人、干部中，进一步整顿劳动纪律。从“西河”号沉没事件还可以看出，天津疏浚队出海船只的船员，有些还缺乏航海知识，因而在航海中一旦发生事故，就无法向来往船只求救。“西河”号被“没凌”轮抛掉后，在当天夜晚发现前方开来大船，为了求救，有的船员模模糊糊记得是应该挂一个红灯（这确是“危险”的信号），但是为了表示十分危险，而又挂上了一个（两个红灯却是表示“我们船不能控制”），并且乱放汽笛。这样，开来的船只发现前方有了不能控制的船只，有紧急鸣笛警告，怕二船相撞，急驶绕道而行，“西河”号便失去了一次被营救的机会。由此可见，航海的必要的技术知识在疏浚船员中也是很重要的。但根据船员反映：天津疏浚队技术座谈会每月只举行一、二次，每次一小时，有时还不能坚持，实际上已经流于形式。“西河”号的沉没是一件带有重大教训的事件。天津海运和疏浚部门必须从中吸取教训，采取坚决的措施，改进工作，以求逐渐杜绝海损事故发生。
