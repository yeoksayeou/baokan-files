National Table Tennis Championships Held in Beijing

    The 1955 National Table Tennis Championships began on the 8th in the practice hall of the Beijing Gymnasium.

    A total of forty-eight male athletes and twenty-four female athletes are participating in this competition. Most of them are new players who have grown up in the recent year or two and have considerable skill. Some of these players defeated the winners of the 1952 National Table Tennis Tournament when they participated in the 1955 National Large and Medium-Sized City Table Tennis League in late November.

    Many of the athletes participating in this competition are workers. Among the eighteen athletes from Shanghai, ten are workers. In Shanghai, table tennis is a mass sport second only to broadcast exercises. Workers participate the most. The twenty-five worker players who participated in the Shanghai Table Tennis League this year were selected from more than thirteen thousand worker athletes.

    This National Table Tennis Championships will be conducted in three rounds. Male and female athletes will first be divided into groups for round-robin matches. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    全国乒乓球冠军赛在京举行
    一九五五年全国乒乓球冠军赛八日开始在北京体育馆的练习馆中举行。
    参加这次比赛的共有四十八名男运动员和二十四名女运动员。他们大部分都是在最近一两年内成长起来的具有相当水平的新选手。其中有些选手在十一月下旬参加一九五五年全国大、中城市乒乓球联赛的时候，曾经打败了在一九五二年全国乒乓球比赛大会上获奖的选手。
    参加这次比赛的运动员，有很多是工人。来自上海的十八名运动员中，就有十名是工人。在上海，乒乓球运动是仅次于广播体操的一项群众性的体育运动。其中工人参加的最多。今年参加上海市乒乓球联赛的二十五名工人选手，就是由一万三千多名工人运动员中选拔出来的。
    这次的全国乒乓球冠军赛将分三轮进行，男女运动员先分组进行循环赛。（据新华社讯）
