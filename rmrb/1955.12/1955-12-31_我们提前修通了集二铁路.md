    The Jining-Erlian Railway is a key railway construction project in China's First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. This railway is a link connecting the capitals of China and Mongolia, and it is also the third railway currently connecting China to the Soviet Union. The construction of this railway will not only contribute to China's socialist construction and the economic prosperity of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, but also greatly promote economic and cultural exchanges between the people of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, and consolidate and develop fraternal friendship.
    The Jining-Erlian Railway is more than 330 kilometers long. From Jining to Tumurtai, the first 100 kilometers are agricultural areas. North of Tumurtai is a pastoral grassland area, interspersed with a section of desert. As an international trunk line, its standards are higher and its transport capacity is stronger than ordinary lines. The entire line is built according to the Soviet wide-gauge standard. Jining North Station is a hub where wide-gauge and standard-gauge railways converge. All mechanical, maintenance, communication, and signaling equipment on the entire line are the latest or relatively modernized.
    Construction of this railway began on May 1, 1953. By now, the roadbed, bridges and culverts, track laying, ballast laying, communications, signals, housing, power equipment, and mechanical installation of the entire line have been basically completed. In terms of quality, after individual repairs, it has reached the standard. According to the decision of the China-Soviet-Mongolia Railway Joint Transport Representative Conference, it will start joint passenger and freight transport with the People's Republic of Mongolia on January 1, 1956.
    The construction of the Jining-Erlian Railway has received strong support from the people of the whole country, various factories and mines, and brother railway bureaus. In particular, the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have not only provided us with houses, transport vehicles and horses, and living materials during the construction of this railway, but also organized many慰问团(comfort groups) to慰问(express sympathy to) the railway construction workers, giving them great encouragement. During the railway construction period, the number of migrant workers supported by various parts of Inner Mongolia reached a maximum of more than 17,000. They completed more than 5.6 million cubic meters of earth and stone work and mined a large amount of ballast. They showed a high degree of self-sacrifice in their work. Comrade He Yuehao, a young migrant worker and alternate member of the Communist Party of China, was one of these people. In July 1954, the Bawang River experienced a flood unseen in many years. The flood washed away the equipment for building the bridge. Local workers, migrant workers, and villagers bravely jumped into the water to rescue people. Comrade He Yuehao sacrificed his life to save a person who was about to be submerged by the flood. The name of Comrade He Yuehao is deeply imprinted in the hearts of all our workers.
    The technical and supply assistance from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries has played a significant role in railway construction. The assistance provided by the Soviet advisors and Soviet experts of the Ministry of Railways has been even more meticulous. Since the start of construction, Soviet experts Kablanov, Ovcharov, Shabri, Shelo Menchev, Kondakov, Halikov, Ivanyuk, Bortolchuk, Dmitriev and others have personally gone to the site to provide specific guidance. They put forward more than 50 suggestions on winter construction, improved construction methods, improved design, and improved management. After the implementation of these suggestions, good results were achieved. In terms of winter construction, according to the experts' opinions, winter construction organization and technical standards were compiled. According to the different situations of various projects, the "frozen soil filling method," "frozen soil blasting method," and "waste soil blasting method" were adopted for roadbed earthwork projects; the "heat storage method" was adopted for bridge and culvert projects, and the "rapid freezing bricklaying method" was adopted for housing projects, which greatly improved work efficiency, shortened the construction period, and reduced winter construction costs, thereby ensuring the comprehensive completion and advanced completion of the task.
    In the construction of the railway, all the employees and migrant workers of the Third Engineering Bureau also brought into play the spirit of hard struggle and heroic tenacity, and completed the glorious task assigned to us by the state.
    The Jining-Erlian line mostly runs through sandy areas. Here, the land is vast and sparsely populated, with little rainfall and a lack of water sources. In a year, the cold season lasts for as long as half a year, and the temperature is generally minus 30 to 40 degrees Celsius when it is coldest. When the windy season comes, there are often winds of level five or six, or even level seven or eight. The wind blows the sand, and the roadbed is not easy to stabilize. These have caused serious difficulties in construction. However, the workers who built the Jining-Erlian Railway were not intimidated by this harsh natural environment. In the fourth quarter of 1954, when laying tracks to Erlian, the workers put forward the slogan "Overcome severe cold, overcome all difficulties, and ensure that tracks are laid to Erlian before the end of the year." The workers of the mechanized road construction troops put forward the slogan "Follow the sun during the day and follow the moon at night," and worked day and night to rush to repair the roadbed. Some migrant workers took out the quilts they were sleeping under to cover the culvert pipes. The workers of the mechanized road construction team also put leather clothes on the mechanical water tanks. When the workers nailing the tracks were nailing the tracks to Erlian, the temperature dropped to minus 37 degrees Celsius. The workers said: The weather is cold, but the heart is hot. The track-laying progress not only did not decrease due to the cold weather, but quickly increased from the original plan of 2.5 kilometers per day to 3.5 kilometers, reaching a maximum of 4.1 kilometers. It was precisely due to the efforts of all the employees that they persisted in construction in the severe cold, and finally laid the tracks to Erlian 14 days ahead of schedule.
    The northern section of the Jining-Erlian line lacks water sources. Although the local herdsmen helped find some water sources and used various vehicles to transport water, due to the lack of water and the distance from the work site and residence, it was often impossible to supply enough water for daily life and work. In order to overcome this difficulty, in water-scarce areas, in winter, the workers brought pots and pans to melt snow into water to drink, and used it to mix mud and build houses. Workers often used the water that had been used to steam馒头(steamed buns) to wash their faces, and after washing their faces, they washed their feet or clothes, and then clarified the water to mix mud and maintain the concrete. Many construction sites have such slogans: "Overcome difficulties, develop water sources, melt snow to save water, and complete the task!"
    Building roads on more than seven kilometers of desert encountered difficulties in construction in addition to the lack of water. People walking on it take half a step back for every step they take forward. When walking on the roadbed, their feet and sand slide down together. When cars are driven onto the desert, the wheels sink and spin idly. People have also found ways to overcome these difficulties. They built scaffolding on both sides of the roadbed, and laid a layer of planks on the main roads, making it easier for people to walk and cars to drive. Carrying soil to the roadbed with dirt baskets is like using a sieve to hold water. It takes a lot of effort to carry a load of sand, and not much is left when you get to the roadbed. Therefore, the workers used cow dung to paste the seams of the baskets, which was both economical and convenient. Sometimes, several strong winds would blow away a lot of the sand and soil on the roadbed. The workers followed the suggestions of Soviet experts and used red clay to wrap the slopes and plant grass on the slopes to overcome these difficulties.
    In the two-year construction process, the workers put forward a total of 2,155 rationalization proposals for improving construction methods, changing designs, and improving labor organization and production tools, saving the country an economic value of 1.47 million yuan; they promoted more than 40 advanced working methods from the Soviet Union and various brother factories and mines, saving the country more than 500,000 yuan. For example, the promotion of the "eagle-mouth hammer crushing stone method" in the Tangshan Stone Quarry increased the stone-crushing work rate by two to three times, eliminating the phenomenon that the work rate could not be completed in the past. The promotion of the Soviet advanced experience "soil retaining plate" on bulldozers avoided losses during bulldozer operation and increased the work rate by 50%. The promotion of the Soviet "roadbed filling and layering ramming method" ensured the quality of the roadbed, prevented subsidence during the rainy season, and greatly accelerated driving capacity.
    In the past two years, many labor models have emerged among the workers. There are two model units at the bureau level, 33 model and advanced groups, 103 labor models, 148 advanced workers, and 97 activists in socialist construction. Among the migrant workers, there were also seven model companies and 39 model migrant workers; among the family members, there were also 17 model family members. There are even more model and advanced figures at the section and team levels. In the past three years, nearly 60,000 workers have been rewarded. These advanced workers and model figures have made great contributions to the construction of the Jining-Erlian line and have also set a brilliant example for the employees of the entire bureau.
    The two-year construction process has passed. We have been tempered in this work into a steel-like road construction team, and have also gained a lot of construction management experience. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work, and the management level of the enterprise is still very low. Especially in the implementation of planned management and economic accounting systems, we do not yet have mature experience and methods. If we measure it by the standards of socialist enterprises, we still need to make great efforts. Now that the international joint transport work of the Jining-Erlian line is about to begin, we are determined to work hard to overcome shortcomings, continue to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and various brother enterprises, improve our work, and complete the greater and more glorious tasks assigned to us by the state.

    我们提前修通了集二铁路
    铁道部新建铁路总局第三工程局代理局长李零石
    集宁到二连铁路是我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划中铁路建设的一项重点工程。这条路，是联系中、蒙两国首都的一条纽带，也是目前由我国通往苏联的第三条铁路。这条铁路的修建，不仅有助于我国的社会主义建设和繁荣内蒙古自治区的经济，而且对进一步促进中、苏、蒙三国人民之间的经济和文化的交流，巩固和发展兄弟般的友谊，都有极重大的意义。
    集二铁路全长三百三十多公里。自集宁到土牧尔台一百多公里是农业地带，由土牧尔台以北是畜牧区草原地带，中间还掺杂一段沙漠地带。由于是国际干线，所以它的标准要比一般线路高些，运输能力也强一些，全线都是按照苏联宽轨标准修建的。集宁北站是宽轨和标准轨交汇的枢纽站。全线所有机械、检修及通信、信号等都是最新式的或者是比较近代化的装备。
    一九五三年五月一日，这条路开始动工修建。到现在，全线的路基、桥涵、铺轨、铺碴、通信、信号、房屋、动力设备以及机械安装等工程已经基本完成。在质量方面，经过个别整修，已经达到标准。根据中、苏、蒙铁路联运代表会议的决定，它将在一九五六年一月一日和蒙古人民共和国开办客货联运。
    集二路的修建，得到了全国人民和各厂矿企业、兄弟路局的大力支援。特别是内蒙古自治区的人民，在这条铁路的修建过程中，不但供给我们房屋、运输车马和生活物资，而且还多次组织慰问团慰问修路职工，给修路职工以很大的鼓舞。铁路修建期间，内蒙古各地支援的民工最高达一万七千多人。他们完成了五百六十多万立公方的土石工程，还开采了大批的道碴。他们在工作中表现了高度的自我牺牲精神。青年民工、中共候补党员贺月好同志就是这许多人中的一个。一九五四年七月，霸王河发生了多年未有的洪水。大水冲跑了修桥的器材。当地职工、民工和老乡们都奋勇下水抢救。贺月好同志为了拯救一个即将被大水淹没的人而献出了自己的生命。贺月好同志的名字，深深地印在我们全体职工的心里。
    苏联和各人民民主国家在技术上以及供应上的帮助，对铁路修建起了很大作用。铁道部苏联顾问和苏联专家给予我们的帮助更是无微不至的。施工以来，苏联专家卡布兰诺夫、奥弗恰洛夫、沙布里、雪洛门切夫、康达柯夫、哈利可夫、伊万纽克、博尔托尔邱克、德米特列耶夫等，都曾经亲到现场具体指导。他们提出了有关冬季施工、改良施工方法、改善设计、改进管理等方面的建议五十多条。这些建议实行以后，都得到了良好的效果。在冬季施工方面，按照专家意见，编制了冬季施工组织和技术标准，并且针对各类工程的不同情况，在路基土方工程上采用了“冻土填方办法”、“冻土爆破法”、
  “弃土爆破法”；在桥涵工程上采用了“蓄热法”，在房屋工程方面采用了“迅速冻结砌砖法”等，都大大地提高了工率，缩短了工期，也降低了冬季施工成本，从而保证了全面完成和提前完成了任务。
    在铁路的修建中，第三工程局的全体职工们、民工们，也发挥了艰苦奋斗和英勇顽强的精神，完成了国家交给我们的光荣任务。
    集二沿线多是含沙地带。这里，地广人稀，雨量少，水源缺乏。在一年中，寒季长达半年，最冷时气温普遍在摄氏零下三十到四十度。每当风季来临，经常有五、六级风，甚至七、八级的大风。风吹沙动，道床不易稳固。这些都造成了施工中的严重困难。但是，修建集二路的职工们并没有被这恶劣的自然环境吓倒。一九五四年第四季度向二连铺轨的时候，工人们提出“战胜严寒，克服一切困难，保证年底前铺轨到二连”的口号。机械筑路部队的职工提出了“白天跟着太阳走，晚上跟着月亮行”的口号，昼夜施工赶修路基。有的民工把自己盖的被子拿出来盖涵管。机械筑路队的工人也把皮衣盖在机械水箱上。钉道工人钉道到二连的时候，气温下降到摄氏零下三十七度。工人们说：天是冷的，心是热的。铺轨进度不仅没有因天冷而降低，反而由原计划每天二点五公里迅速提高到三点五公里，最高达四点一公里。正是由于全体职工们的努力，在严寒中坚持了施工，终于提前十四天把路轨铺到了二连。
    集二线北段水源缺乏，当地牧民们虽然帮助找到了一些水源，并且利用各种车辆运水，但是因为水少，离工作地点和住地很远，生活和工作用水常常供应不上。为了克服这个困难，在缺水地区，冬天，工人们就带着锅把雪化成水喝，并且用它来合泥盖房。工人们常常用蒸过馒头的水洗脸，洗过脸后再洗脚或洗衣服，然后澄清用来拌泥、养生。许多工地都有这样的标语：“战胜困难，开挖水源，溶雪省水，完成任务！”
    在七公里多的沙漠地带上修路，除缺水外，在施工上也遇到了困难。人走在上面，走一步退半步，往路基上走，脚和沙子要一起滑下去。汽车开到沙漠上，轮子就陷下去打空转。这些困难，人们也设法克服了。他们在路基两旁搭上脚手架，在主要道路上铺设了一层板子，人走车行也就方便多了。用土篮往路基上挑土，就像筛子盛水一样，费很大劲才挑一担沙，走到路基上就剩不多了。于是，工人们就用牛粪糊篮子缝，既经济又便当。有时，几阵大风会把路基的沙土给吹掉很多。工人们执行苏联专家的建议，用红黏土包边坡和在边坡上栽草，克服了这些困难。
    总计在二年多施工的过程中，职工们提出的改善施工方法、改变设计、改进劳动组织和生产工具等方面的合理化建议，共达二千一百五十五件，给国家节约的经济价值达一百四十七万元；推行了苏联和各兄弟厂矿的先进工作方法四十多种，为国家节约了五十多万元。其中如推行唐山石场“鹰嘴锤打碎石法”，提高打石工率两倍到三倍，消除了过去完不成工率的现象。在推土机上推行苏联先进经验“挡土板”，避免了推土运行中的损失，也提高工率百分之五十。推行苏联“路基填土分层打夯法”，保证了路基质量，防止雨季沉落，大大加速了行车能力。
    二年多来，职工中涌现出来的劳动模范也很多。计局一级的模范单位两个，模范及先进小组三十三个，劳动模范一百零三名，先进工作者一百四十八名，社会主义建设积极分子九十七名。在民工中也出现了七个模范中队和三十九名模范民工；在家属中也出现了十七名模范家属。段队一级的模范和先进人物那就更多了。三年中受到奖励的职工就约近六万人次。这些先进工作者和模范人物对修建集二线作出了丰功伟绩，也给全局员工树立了光辉的榜样。
    二年多的施工过程过去了。我们已经在这个工作中锻炼成了一支钢铁般的修路队伍，也取得了不少的施工管理经验。但是，我们工作中的缺点还是很多的，企业的管理水平还很低，特别是在实行计划管理和经济核算制方面，我们还没有成熟的经验和办法，如果用社会主义企业的水平来衡量，我们还需要作很大的努力。现在，集二线的国际联运工作就要开始了，我们决心努力克服缺点，继续学习苏联和各兄弟企业的先进经验，改进工作，以完成国家所交给我们的更大更光荣的任务。（附图片）
