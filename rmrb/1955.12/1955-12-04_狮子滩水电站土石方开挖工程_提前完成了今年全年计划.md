    Shizitan Hydropower Station Earth and Stone Excavation Project
    Completes Full-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule

    To the Editor:

    The largest project at the Shizitan Hydropower Station construction site – the earth and stone excavation project for the dam foundation – was completed ahead of schedule on November 10th. It also exceeded the quota by excavating an additional 6,743 cubic meters of rock, ensuring the quality of the technically complex project and eliminating major accidents. Construction on this project began last November. At that time, although it was the dry season, the river flowed rapidly like an arrow, with a flow rate of more than 100 cubic meters per second. Both banks were barren hillsides and steep cliffs. All the workers of our engineering team started the earth-shattering endeavor here, working day and night, braving the heat, wind, and snow, to transport the mud and stones from the deep foundation pit. In more than ten months, we excavated a total of 98,847 cubic meters of rock and 26,176 cubic meters of earth. The Modan Mountain, towering on the left bank of Shizitan, has been cut away by more than half.

    Over the past year, one stone-excavation shock brigade after another has emerged and grown on the Shizitan construction site. In October, one-sixth of the employees received state material rewards and commendations for their outstanding work. The young workers of our excavation team also organized a thrift team, using their spare time to pick up scrap iron, waste materials, and repair damaged tools. The Li Chunfang thrift team alone (composed of eleven young workers) collected more than 500 kilograms of waste materials in one month. Our explosive consumption quota has been reduced from 0.4 kilograms per cubic meter to 0.15 kilograms per cubic meter. Of course, we are not satisfied with our current achievements. We are working hard to prepare to overcome floods and strive to overfulfill more state tasks by the end of the year, creating conditions for the hydropower station to generate electricity ahead of schedule at the end of 1956!

### 狮子滩水电站土石方开挖工程  提前完成了今年全年计划

    狮子滩水电站土石方开挖工程
    提前完成了今年全年计划编辑同志：
    狮子滩水电站工地最大的工程——大坝基础土石方开挖工程，在十一月十日已经提前完成了今年全年计划，并且超额开挖石方六千七百四十三立方，保证了技术复杂的工程质量，消灭了重大事故。这个工程是去年十一月开始施工的。那时候，虽然是在枯水期，但是河水还是像箭一样地急，每秒钟的流量是一百多立方公尺。两岸全是荒芜的山坡和陡崖。我们工程队的全体职工就在这里开始了移山倒海的事业，不分白天黑夜，冒着炎热和风雪，把泥土石头从基础深坑里运出来。十个多月，我们共开挖了石方九万八千八百四十七立方公尺，土方二万六千一百七十六立方公尺。雄踞在狮子滩左岸的磨担山被我们削去了一大半。
    过去这一年，一支又一支的石工开挖突击队接连地出现和成长在狮子滩工地上。十月份，有六分之一的职工由于他们出色的劳动，受到了国家的物质奖励和表扬。我们开挖工程队的青年工人还组织了节约队，利用休息时间拣废铁、废料和修理损坏了的工具。光是李纯芳节约队（由十一个青年工人组成）一个月就拣了废料五百多公斤。我们的炸药消耗定额由每立方公尺零点四公斤降低到零点一五公斤。当然，我们并不满足于目前这点成绩，我们正在为准备战胜洪水、争取到年底超额完成更多的国家任务而奋斗，为水电站提前在一九五六年年底发电而创造条件！
