    Acts Undermining the Geneva Accords Must Be Stopped

    The fourth working report recently submitted by the International Commission for Vietnam emphasizes that the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem government's opposition to the Geneva Accords has "seriously threatened the continuation of the International Commission's activities and the effective execution of its mission." The International Commission requests the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and all participating countries of the Geneva Conference to consider this issue so that the International Commission can continue to work effectively. The situation described in the International Commission's report and the issue it raises cannot but arouse the serious attention of all countries and people who are concerned about maintaining the Geneva Accords.

    For months, under the direction and support of the United States, the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem government has been using the so-called "South Vietnam is not bound by the Geneva Accords" as an excuse to refuse to consult with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of free elections throughout Vietnam, as stipulated in the Geneva Accords. Now, the Ngo Dinh Diem government is attempting to use the same excuse to undermine the work of the International Commission for Vietnam. Not only that, but the Ngo Dinh Diem government, disregarding the various provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the protection of democratic freedoms of the people, is frantically persecuting former resistance members in South Vietnam and other democrats who demand peaceful reunification. Moreover, the Ngo Dinh Diem government, together with the United States, is stepping up the shipment of reinforcing war materials into South Vietnam.

    The claim of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem government that "South Vietnam is not bound by the Geneva Accords" is completely untenable. South Vietnam is one of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference. At the same time, the representative of the French Federal Forces, when signing the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, represented not only France but also the southern region of Vietnam. Article 27 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam also explicitly stipulates: "The signatories of this document and their successors in office shall be responsible for ensuring the observance and enforcement of the terms and provisions thereof." As Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out in his parliamentary speech on September 6th this year, it is wrong to enjoy the benefits brought by the agreement while attempting not to accept other aspects of the agreement. In his letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on November 25th, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong also fully refuted this fallacy of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem government. The International Commission for Vietnam is absolutely correct in clearly pointing out in this report that it has the right to demand that the Ngo Dinh Diem government provide the International Commission with protection, assistance, and cooperation in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

    The Ngo Dinh Diem government's serious undermining of the Geneva Accords is also manifested in the reign of terror it has been implementing in South Vietnam for some time. The Geneva Accords clearly stipulate that "each party undertakes to refrain from any reprisals or discrimination against individuals or organizations for their activities during the period of hostilities and guarantees their democratic freedoms." However, the Ngo Dinh Diem government has violated this clause of the Geneva Accords countless times since the ceasefire. At the end of last year, the Ngo Dinh Diem government further launched the so-called "Denounce the Communists Movement" in South Vietnam, blatantly persecuting former resistance members. According to reports in the Vietnam People's Daily, by September of this year, approximately 10,000 people had been killed, injured, or arrested in the "Denounce the Communists Movement." In November of this year, the Ngo Dinh Diem government also openly announced that it would advance this "Denounce the Communists Movement" to a new stage, establishing the terrorist organization of the "Denounce the Communists Movement" in every village in South Vietnam in order to further persecute former resistance members and democrats who advocate peace and unity. In this report, the International Commission for Vietnam clearly condemned the Ngo Dinh Diem government's behavior of undermining the Geneva Accords. The International Commission has also continuously requested the relevant responsible authorities in South Vietnam to take corrective measures. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem government has ignored this. The International Commission's investigation of such violations in South Vietnam is also continuing to be obstructed by the Ngo Dinh Diem government in various ways.

    It should be pointed out that the terrorist activities carried out by the Ngo Dinh Diem government in South Vietnam are also carried out under the direction and with the assistance of the United States. A few days after the United States sent Collins to South Vietnam in early November last year, Dulles publicly stated: "South Vietnam needs a strong government. This government, with the assistance of an efficient police and gendarmerie, will eliminate troublemakers. Collins is currently in South Vietnam to recommend certain necessary measures, and, if necessary, to take these measures himself." The so-called "Denounce the Communists Movement" in South Vietnam began under Dulles's instigation. After the start of this movement, the U.S. military advisory group in South Vietnam also specifically opened training classes in various places, teaching the American-style secret service methods to the Ngo Dinh Diem government's henchmen.

    Not only that, but the United States, together with the Ngo Dinh Diem government, has violated the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the prohibition of South Vietnam from entering reinforcing war materials. The People's Army of Vietnam has exposed many facts about the United States smuggling war materials into South Vietnam after the ceasefire. Officials of the Ngo Dinh Diem government even openly boasted on Saigon Radio on November 24th this year that "the South Vietnamese Air Force previously only had French Morane aircraft, but today these aircraft are being replaced by L-19 aircraft with much higher speeds. South Vietnamese technicians have assembled approximately 30 L-19 aircraft using parts sent by the United States as aid." Recently, the official news agency of the Ngo Dinh Diem government, "Vietnam Press," in praising the "achievements" of the outgoing former head of the U.S. military advisory group in South Vietnam, O'Daniel, also mentioned that the United States had been "actively transporting military materials" for more than a year, thus making the South Vietnamese army, which was originally "lacking equipment," "well-equipped." "Vietnam Press" also said that O'Daniel "expanded the South Vietnamese navy and air force," adding fighter-bombers, transport planes, and liaison planes to the South Vietnamese air force, and "light naval vessels" to the navy. In this working report, the International Commission for Vietnam also pointed out that it had discovered cases of smuggled war materials into South Vietnam. The International Commission also specifically pointed out that when the international teams sent to supervise South Vietnam from receiving reinforcing military personnel and war materials from abroad inspected the coastal areas of South Vietnam, they were subjected to various obstacles by the Ngo Dinh Diem government. Not long ago, the International Commission also clearly pointed out that "the movement of personnel and equipment between U.S. bases in the Pacific and South Vietnam has been increasing in recent months, but the International Commission is unable to control it," and that South Vietnam "has not notified the International Commission of the arrival of U.S. military equipment and personnel in South Vietnam." While stepping up the shipment of reinforcing war materials into South Vietnam, O'Daniel even openly clamored that South Vietnam now "may be suitable to directly participate in the Southeast Asia Defense Treaty." Obviously, the United States is attempting to pull South Vietnam completely into the Manila Treaty military bloc step by step, undermining peace in Indochina.

    Due to the various obstructions and sabotage by the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem government, various obstacles have indeed arisen in the implementation of the Geneva Accords. In their joint statement on December 13th, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin and Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out that violations of the Geneva Accords "will have very serious consequences for Indochina and the world. Therefore, the heads of state of the two countries are willing to appeal to all countries participating in the agreement and relevant parties to remove the obstacles currently hindering the genuine implementation of the Geneva Accords and to work together to fulfill the letter and spirit of these agreements." The Chinese people fully support this statement. The Chinese people also fully support the propositions put forward by Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong in his letters to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on August 17th and November 25th this year. The two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and all participating countries of the Geneva Conference have a responsibility to take all necessary measures to promote the consultative conference between the two sides of Vietnam on the issue of free elections throughout Vietnam, to ensure that the International Commission is given protection, assistance, and cooperation, and to stop all acts that violate the Geneva Accords.

### 破坏日内瓦协议的行为必须制止

    破坏日内瓦协议的行为必须制止
    越南国际委员会最近提出的第四次工作报告着重指出，南越吴庭艳政府反对日内瓦协议的态度已经使“国际委员会继续进行活动并且有效地执行其任务遭受到严重的威胁”。国际委员会要求日内瓦会议两位主席和日内瓦会议的所有参加国考虑这一问题，使国际委员会得以继续有效地进行工作，国际委员会在报告中所叙述的这一情况和所提出的这一问题，不能不引起一切关心维护日内瓦协议的国家和人民的严重注意。
    几个月来，在美国的指使和支持下，南越吴庭艳政府一直以所谓“南越不受日内瓦协议的约束”作为借口，拒绝按照日内瓦协议的规定同越南民主共和国方面就全越南自由选举问题进行协商。现在，吴庭艳政府又企图用同样的借口来破坏越南国际委员会的工作。不但如此，吴庭艳政府还不顾日内瓦协议有关保障人民民主自由的各项规定，疯狂迫害南越前抗战人员和其他要求和平统一的民主人士。而且，吴庭艳政府正同美国一道，在南越加紧运进增援性的作战物资。
    美国和吴庭艳政府所谓“南越不受日内瓦协议约束”的说法，是完全不能成立的。南越是日内瓦会议的参加国之一。同时，法兰西联邦军的代表在越南停止敌对行动的协定上签字的时候，不但代表了法国，而且也代表了越南南部地区。在越南停止敌对行动协定第二十七条还明确规定：“本文件签署人及其职务的继承人均应负责遵守并实施本协定的各项条款和规定”。正如印度总理尼赫鲁今年九月六日的国会演说中所指出，享受协议所带来的利益而又试图不接受协议的其他方面，那是错误的。越南民主共和国外交部长范文同十一月二十五日给日内瓦会议两位主席的信中，也已经充分驳斥了美国和吴庭艳政府的这种谬论。越南国际委员会在这次报告中明确指出它有权要求吴庭艳政府按照日内瓦协议的规定给予国际委员会以保护、协助和合作，这是完全正确的。
    吴庭艳政府对日内瓦协议的严重破坏，也表现在它这一段时期来在南越所实行的恐怖统治上。日内瓦协议明文规定，“各方约定，不因个人和团体在敌对行动期间的活动而对其加以任何报复和歧视，并且保障其民主自由。”但是，吴庭艳政府在停战后曾经无数次地违反了日内瓦协议的这一条款。在去年年底，吴庭艳政府在南越进一步展开了所谓“控诉共产党运动”，明目张胆地迫害前抗战人员。据越南人民报的报道，到今年九月为止，在“控诉共产党运动”中被杀、受伤和被捕的，已经有一万人左右。今年十一月间，吴庭艳政府还公开宣布要把这一“控诉共产党运动”推进到一个新的阶段，要在南越的每一个村庄都成立“控诉共产党运动”的恐怖组织，以便进一步迫害前抗战人员和拥护和平、赞成统一的民主人士。越南国际委员会在这次提出的报告中明确地谴责吴庭艳政府这种破坏日内瓦协议的行为。国际委员会并且不断要求南越有关负责当局采取纠正措施。但是，吴庭艳政府却对此置之不理。国际委员会目前在南越对这一类违协事件所进行的调查工作，也正继续遭到吴庭艳政府的种种阻挠。
    应该指出，吴庭艳政府在南越所进行的恐怖活动，也是在美国的指使和协助下进行的。去年十一月初美国派柯林斯到南越后没有几天，杜勒斯就公开声称：“南越需要一个坚强的政府。这个政府将在有效率的警察和宪兵的协助下，消灭捣乱分子。柯林斯目前到南越去，就是为了要推荐某些必要措施，而且，如果必要的话，由他自己来采取这些措施。”南越的所谓“控诉共产党运动”正是在杜勒斯的这种叫嚣唆使下开始的。在这一运动开始后，美国驻南越的军事顾问团还曾经特地在各地开办了训练班，把美国式的特务手段，传授给吴庭艳政府的爪牙。
    不但如此，美国还同吴庭艳政府一道，违反了日内瓦协议中有关禁止南越进入增援性作战物资的规定。越南人民军方面曾经揭露了停战后美国偷运作战物资进入南越的许多事实。吴庭艳政府的官方人员在西贡电台今年十一月二十四日的广播中还公开吹嘘“南越空军从前只有法国莫兰式飞机，今天这些飞机正由速度高得多的L—十九型飞机所代替。南越技术人员已经用美国作为援助送来的零件装配了约三十架L—十九型飞机。”最近，吴庭艳政府官方通讯社“越南新闻社”在歌颂刚卸任的前美国驻南越军事顾问团团长奥丹尼尔的“功迹”时，也提到美国一年多来曾经“积极运来军事物资”，因此使原来“装备缺乏”的南越军队“装备完善”。“越南新闻社”还说，奥丹尼尔“扩展了南越的海军和空军”，使南越的空军增加了驱逐轰炸机、运输机和联络机，海军方面有了“轻型舰艇”。越南国际委员会在这次工作报告中也指出，它已经在南越发现偷运入作战物资的情况。国际委员会并且特别提出，为了监督南越不从境外进入增援性军事人员和作战物资而派出的国际小组到南越沿海地区视察的时候，遭受到吴庭艳政府的种种阻挠。前不久，国际委员会还明确指出，“几个月来，美国在太平洋中的基地同南越之间的人员和装备的调动日益增加，但是国际委员会无法加以控制”，南越方面“并没有把美国军事装备和人员到达南越的事通知国际委员会”。在加紧以增援性作战物资运入南越的同时，奥丹尼尔竟还公开叫嚣说，南越现在“直接参加东南亚防务联盟可能是适当的”。显然，美国正企图一步紧一步地把南越完全拉入马尼拉条约军事集团，破坏印度支那的和平。
    由于美国和吴庭艳政府的各方面的阻挠和破坏，在实行日内瓦协议方面的确产生了种种的障碍。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和印度总理尼赫鲁在十二月十三日的联合声明中曾经指出过，违反日内瓦协议“将对印度支那和全世界造成非常严重的后果。因此，两国的国家领导人员愿意向一切参加协议的国家和有关方面提出要求：排除目前横梗在真正实行日内瓦协议的道路上的障碍，并且通力合作来履行这些协定的文字和精神。”中国人民完全支持这一声明。中国人民也完全支持越南民主共和国外交部长范文同在今年八月十七日和十一月二十五日给日内瓦会议两位主席的信中所提出的主张。日内瓦会议的两位主席和日内瓦会议的所有参加国负有责任采取一切必要措施，促成越南双方有关全越南自由选举问题的协商会议，保证给予国际委员会以保护、协助和合作，制止一切违反日内瓦协议的行为。
