    New Attitudes of Salesclerks in Hangzhou Cotton Fabric Stores
    In the past, employees in the cotton fabric industry in Hangzhou more or less held the idea of “valuing big customers and belittling small customers.” They provided more attentive service to "big customers," but were relatively cold to those buying fewer items. In several cotton fabric stores located in the Maiyuchiao area, farmers frequently came to buy things. If the farmers selected items carefully, the salesclerks would become impatient and sometimes wouldn't even greet them.

    However, the situation is completely different now. On the morning of December 12th, a rural girl and a rural youth walked into the joint state-private Dingtai Cotton Fabric Retail Store. They both wanted to buy fabric for a jacket for themselves. Xu Yaocan, a 55-year-old salesclerk, enthusiastically helped them with the selection. He first took out a fabric called "Cairou Ge" (Colored Soft Grid), but the rural girl didn't like it. He then took out Kanglege (Happy Grid), Nvxian Ni (Ladies' Serge) (both names of floral fabrics), Gongnong Lanbu (Worker-Peasant Blue Fabric), and Huada Ni (Gabardine), among other varieties.

    The two customers looked at more than ten kinds of fabric in total but still couldn't decide which one to buy. If this had happened before the implementation of joint state-private ownership, some salesclerks might have already become impatient. However, Xu Yaocan, after studying before and after the joint state-private ownership, understood that he needed to further improve his service attitude, so he remained very patient. He pointed to a piece of Cairou Ge and said, "This fabric, with a dark brown base and blue grids, sells the best in rural areas." The rural girl was worried that the fabric wouldn't be strong enough and the color would fade easily, so he explained it carefully. The two customers understood the properties of this cotton fabric and found it very much to their liking, so they asked Xu Yaocan to cut seven chi (a Chinese unit of length, approximately 1/3 meter), and also bought six chi five cun (approximately 1/30 meter) of Huada Ni.

    On December 2nd, a customer came to the Hushu joint state-private Zhengdachang Cotton Fabric Retail Store to buy one zhang (a Chinese unit of length, approximately 3 1/3 meters) of blue twill fabric. The fabric had already been selected, measured, and a cut had been made, just about to be cut off completely, when suddenly a rough thread end, about half a grain of rice in size, was discovered on the edge of the fabric. Such situations had been encountered in the past. At that time, when salesclerks discovered thread ends, they would just cut them off with scissors, and wouldn't even let the customer notice. However, after the implementation of joint state-private ownership, the salesclerk Shen Baogen did not handle it this way.

    "This is a rough thread end, which is due to carelessness during production," Shen Baogen patiently explained to the customer. "It naturally wouldn't look good to have such a defect on new clothes. However, this thread end is on the edge of the fabric and can be cut off when making the clothes."

    The customer was initially unwilling. Shen Baogen then told him, "You might as well go to the tailor shop next door to measure and see if it can be cut off. If it can't be cut off, we guarantee to exchange it for you. If it happens to be cut off, then there's no need to exchange it. Because this piece of fabric has already been cut, if you don't want it, it will have to be sold at a discount, which would cause losses to the state."

    The customer felt that what Shen Baogen said was very correct. He also knew that the entire cotton fabric retail industry had implemented joint state-private ownership, and if this small defect didn't affect the appearance of the clothes, why should the state suffer losses? He immediately took the fabric to the tailor shop. After a while, he came back excitedly. "This little thread end won't be cut into the clothes, I don't need to exchange it."

    Then, he bought another one zhang six chi of fabric and left the store very satisfied. Shen Baogen also felt very happy because he had improved his service attitude, both protecting the interests of consumers and preventing losses to the state.

    One Sunday afternoon, the first sales department of the joint state-private Wulian Cotton Fabric Company was particularly busy. A customer came up and asked:

    "How much fabric do I need for the lining of a quilt?"

    "How wide is your quilt batting? Generally, you need two widths," the salesclerk Pan Heling said, pointing to a piece of quilt cover fabric that was three chi three cun wide.

    "It's an eight-jin (a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 1/2 kilogram) cotton quilt. I haven't measured how wide it is, are two widths enough?"

    This sentence stumped Lao Pan. He thought, "I don't even know how wide an eight-jin quilt batting is. If I guarantee that it's enough, what if it's not?"

    The customer saw that the salesclerk wasn't sure how much fabric to buy either, so he had to leave in disappointment. In the past, Pan Heling wouldn't have cared much about such a thing; but today, he felt particularly sad. He clearly remembered that when listening to the report, the leaders had said: "After the implementation of joint state-private ownership in the cotton fabric industry, the nature of the enterprise has changed. Employees should learn from the salesclerks of state-owned companies and serve consumers better." Now, consumers can't buy the things they need to their satisfaction, how can this be allowed?

    Later, Pan Heling came up with a way to improve. He went to the department store to write down the length and width of various quilt battings and posted them inside the counter. In this way, when consumers come to buy quilt cover fabric, they can check and know how many zhang and chi they need, and they won't go back empty-handed anymore.

    A few days ago, the first sales department of the joint state-private Wulian Cotton Fabric Company also sent several salesclerks to the state-owned department store to learn advanced experience. After returning to the store, they discussed and proposed six suggestions for improving work, preparing to continuously improve the quality of work.

### 杭州棉布店里营业员的新态度

    杭州棉布店里营业员的新态度
    杭州市棉布业的职工，过去或多或少的都有“重视大顾客、轻视小顾客”的思想。看到“大顾客”，服务得比较周到；如果东西买得少，态度就比较冷淡。开设在卖鱼桥一带的几家棉布店，经常有农民来买东西，农民挑选得仔细一些，营业员就不耐烦起来，有时甚至连招呼也不打。
    可是，现在的情形完全不同了。十二月十二日上午，一个农村姑娘和一个农村青年，走进了公私合营鼎泰棉布零售店。他们都要为自己买一件上衣的料子。五十五岁的营业员徐耀灿，就热情地帮助他们挑选起来。他首先拿出一块叫做彩柔格的花布，农村姑娘不中意，他又拿出了康乐格、女线呢（都是花布的名称）、工农蓝布、华达呢等好几种品种。
    这两个顾客一共看了十多种布，还是决定不下买哪一种好。假使在实行公私合营以前，有的营业员可能早就不耐烦了。但是，徐耀灿经过在公私合营前后的学习，懂得自己要进一步改善服务态度，所以仍旧非常耐心。他指着一块彩柔格说：“这块料子酱色的底子，蓝色的格子，是在农村里销路最好的。”那个农村姑娘怕布身不大牢固，颜色容易褪掉，他都仔细地作了解释。两个顾客了解了这种棉布的性能，也觉得非常中意，就叫徐耀灿剪了七尺，另外，又买了六尺五寸华达呢。

    十二月二日，有一个顾客来到湖墅公私合营正大昌棉布零售店买了一丈蓝色斜纹布。布已经拣好、量好，并且剪上了一刀，正准备摊开剪断的时候，突然发现在布边上有一个半粒米大的粗纱头。这样的情况，过去也遇到过。那时营业员发现了纱头，用剪刀剪掉就算了，甚至还不让顾客发现。但是，在实行公私合营以后，营业员沈宝根不是这样处理了。
    “这是一个粗纱头，是生产时不当心的缘故。”沈宝根耐心地向顾客解释。“新衣服上有这么一个毛病，自然不大好看。但是，这个纱头在布的旁边，做衣服的时候是可以裁去的。”
    顾客起初不大愿意。沈宝根又告诉他：“你不妨先到旁边成衣铺去量量看，如果裁不掉，我们保证给你换。如果恰好剪掉了，那就不必换了。因为这块布已经剪了一刀，你不要，以后要打折扣出售，那就会给国家造成损失。”
    顾客听沈宝根的话说得很对。他也知道：棉布零售商业实行了全行业公私合营，如果这点小毛病不影响衣服的美观，又何必要国家受到损失呢？他立即拿了布到成衣铺去。过了一会，就兴奋地拿回来了。“这个小纱头不会裁到衣服上，我不要掉换了。”
    接着，他又买了一丈六尺布，很满意地出了店门。沈宝根也觉得很高兴，因为他改善了服务态度，既保护了消费者的利益，又不使国家受到损失。

    在一个星期日的下午，公私合营五联棉布公司第一门市部显得格外忙碌。一个顾客上来问了一句：
    “做一条被夹里要多少布？”
    “你的被胎有多少宽？一般的要二幅。”营业员潘鹤龄指着一块有三尺三寸宽的被单布说。
    “是八斤重的棉被。没有量过有多少宽，二幅够吗？”
    这句话一下难住了老潘。他想：“八斤重的被胎有多少宽，自己心里也没有数。要说保证够用，万一不够怎么办呢？”
    顾客看到营业员也不清楚要买多少布，只好失望地走了。潘鹤龄过去遇到这样的事情，心里不大在意；但是在今天，他感到特别难过。他清楚地记得在听报告的时候领导上说过：“棉布业实行公私合营以后，企业性质改变了。职工们应该向国营公司的营业员学习，更好地为消费者服务。”如今，消费者不能满意地买到需要的东西，这怎么行呢？
    以后，潘鹤龄想了一个改进的办法。他到百货公司去把各种被胎的长度、宽度都记下来，贴在柜台里边。这样一来，消费者来买被单布，一查就能知道要几丈、几尺，再不会空着手回去了。
    公私合营五联棉布公司第一门市部，前几天又派了几个营业员到国营百货公司去学习先进经验。回店以后，就讨论提出了六条改进工作的建议，准备不断地提高工作质量。
