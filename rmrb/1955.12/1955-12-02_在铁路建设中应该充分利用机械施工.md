Full Use of Mechanical Construction Should be Made in Railway Construction
Li Banmu

In the construction of new railway lines, the extensive use of machinery to replace heavy manual labor, thereby continuously increasing labor productivity, shortening construction periods, ensuring project quality, and reducing project costs, is an advanced experience in Soviet railway construction. The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways vigorously promoted this experience during the construction of the Lanxin Railway, and also put forward the slogan of promoting small-scale mechanized construction to adapt to the insufficient existing construction machinery. To ensure the smooth progress of this new work, measures were taken to centrally lead and uniformly allocate construction machinery to improve the utilization rate of machinery. In terms of organizational work, professional mechanical road construction teams, mechanical leasing stations, and automobile transportation teams were organized. This series of measures enabled small-scale mechanized construction to have a certain scale, and demonstrated the superiority of small-scale mechanized construction in the large amount of earth and stone work of "moving mountains and filling valleys" in Wushaoling, and in difficult projects on grasslands and Gobi deserts where there was a shortage of water and it was not possible to use more labor.

However, what is puzzling is that the small-scale mechanized construction of the First Engineering Bureau has not only failed to develop this year, but has instead regressed. According to statistics, the machinery utilization rate of the First Engineering Bureau's mechanical road construction team from January to June this year only reached 42%, and the machinery attendance rate only reached 34.9% of the attendance rate stipulated by the Ministry of Railways. Therefore, the First Engineering Bureau failed to complete its production plan in the first three quarters of this year. As of the end of August, losses in terms of project value alone amounted to more than 669,000 yuan. From January to September, the mechanical leasing station of the First Engineering Bureau leased out an average of only 30% of all machinery each month. The average attendance rate of the automobile transportation team from January to May this year was only 40.5% of the planned attendance rate. The decrease in machinery utilization rate and attendance rate has resulted in the long-term backlog and waste of a large number of machines.

Why is there a phenomenon of low machinery utilization rate, decreased attendance rate, and long-term backlog and waste? Regarding this issue, the relevant units each have their own set of views. However, if you analyze it carefully, it is not difficult to see that these views do not consider the problem from the perspective of subjective efforts, but one-sidedly emphasize objective reasons. For example, many people believe that the machinery is old and the maintenance quality is poor; some people believe that mechanical construction is more costly than manual construction; some people believe that people are easier to manage than machinery, machinery is specialized and fixed, while people can do a variety of work... Under the domination of these wrong ideas, they simply do not use machinery. For example, the Fifth Engineering Section, in the construction of the Shuifu River Bridge project on the Baolan Railway, did not use a concrete mixer, but used manual labor to mix concrete. When the bridge entered the high-altitude concrete pouring operation, they called twelve people to pull a bucket of concrete up, while the mechanical leasing station was hoarding twelve power winches. The Third Engineering Section, in the construction of the Lanxin Road, put the existing mechanical equipment of the bridge construction team aside, but used manual pile driving.

Is mechanical construction really more costly than manual construction? No, it is not. The result of promoting small-scale mechanized construction in Wushaoling in the fourth quarter of 1953 is proof. Wushaoling has more than 3 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. According to the original plan, it would take 14 joint operation teams and one sand and gravel team to complete it. However, due to the promotion of small-scale mechanized construction, the general efficiency increased by 60%, and the highest reached 300%. As a result, 4,500 laborers were reduced, and only nine joint teams were used to complete the task. In the 345,737 cubic meters of roadbed earth and stone work completed in November, 320,000 cubic meters were completed by machinery. According to the statistics of the 17-kilometer roadbed construction from Chaxitan to Chenjiagou on the Lanxin Road, one bulldozer can replace the work of more than 100 people in the same working time; one scraper can replace the work of 200 people. This shows that small-scale mechanical construction can not only improve efficiency and reduce labor, but also reduce project costs.

Is the outdated machinery the reason for the low attendance rate and utilization rate? Not entirely. In fact, many new machines are also backlogged. As long as the maintenance and upkeep are strengthened, the old machinery can still serve the project. For example, in this engineering bureau, there is a car that was manufactured in 1936 and scrapped in 1950. However, during the "Three-Anti" movement in 1952, the workers repaired the car. In 1953, after completing about 3,000 kilometers of transportation tasks, the car was scrapped again. In the "Increase Production and Practice Economy" campaign launched this year, Xu Guobin, a demobilized soldier, with the support of the Party organization, repaired it again. This made the car not only exceed its transportation tasks every month, but also become the "winning car" among the automobile transportation team's more than 100 cars.

Of course, some of the machinery in the bureau as a whole is unusable. For example, some of the American machinery that was received is dilapidated and there is no source of parts. In addition, there are also some machines that are seasonal and special, such as pumps, blowers, root removers, boilers... which cannot be used frequently. However, a thorough inspection of those dilapidated machines should be carried out, and some of them can definitely be repaired. Those that really cannot be repaired should also be reported for approval to be scrapped. However, they did not do so. The current situation is: good and bad are not distinguished, the bad are backlogged, and the good are also backlogged; the bad are not cherished, and the good are not cherished, coupled with shortcomings in maintenance and upkeep, and the lack of some mechanical parts, which naturally gives units that are unwilling to use mechanical construction an excuse.

As for some people who think that people are easier to manage than machinery, and that people can do a variety of work, this view is certainly incorrect. It is important to know that machinery is operated by people. As long as it is used properly, machinery will save people a lot of useful labor. Therefore, the important thing is to be familiar with the machinery and master it, so that it can exert its strength in construction, rather than idle the equipment and go back to the road of manual operation.

It can be seen that the reason for the low machinery utilization rate and attendance rate, and the large backlog and waste of machinery in the small-scale mechanized construction of the First Engineering Bureau, is not the outdated machinery, or that mechanical construction is more costly than manual construction, but an ideological problem. To be precise, it is due to the ideological problems of the leading staff. Since this year, the leading staff of the First Engineering Bureau have not consistently implemented the established policy of promoting small-scale mechanized construction. When preparing the construction organization design, they did not allocate a certain number of machines in advance according to the project quantity and nature of the construction unit, and did not specify that machinery must be used in certain projects. They also adopted a do-nothing attitude towards the situation where the on-site units were unwilling to use mechanical construction. The unit specifically responsible for leading small-scale mechanical construction has been unable to formulate practical machinery usage plans for a long time, so that the mechanical leasing station and the mechanical repair shop are clueless in the work of machinery rental and maintenance. And the leadership of the bureau did not promptly check and correct this situation.

When reorganizing the organization, the First Engineering Bureau abolished the affiliated enterprise department, and the subordinate machinery and transportation sections were directly led by the director, which is completely correct. However, the abolition of the small-scale mechanization research group seems to be worth discussing. This organization was established in 1954 when large-scale small-scale mechanized construction began, in order to solve the problems that occurred in construction in a timely manner, and it also played a certain role. If we want to adhere to the policy of small-scale mechanized construction and make it continue to develop, this organization should not be abolished.

This attitude of the leadership of the First Engineering Bureau has caused a bad influence among the workers. For example, the same Fifth Engineering Section achieved great results in promoting small-scale mechanized construction in Wushaoling in the fourth quarter of 1953, and also accumulated some experience, but in the Shuifu River Bridge construction on the Baolan Line this year, it was unwilling to use machinery. In the same automobile transportation team, some people can repair old cars and exceed their tasks every month, while others drive cars to chase yellow sheep on the beach, resulting in the burning of the cylinder head. More seriously, some people dismantled three brand new cars, and other drivers came from these three cars to "take what they needed." Because those who cherish state property were not rewarded in time, and those who damaged state machinery were not given appropriate treatment, some staff members developed a "don't care" mentality in the work of machinery storage, use, and maintenance. Are these not caused by the leading staff's lack of attention to mechanized construction and ideological negligence?

We believe that this phenomenon in the mechanized construction of the First Engineering Bureau should no longer continue.

    在铁路建设中应该充分利用机械施工
    李般木
    在铁路新线的施工中，尽量运用机械来代替笨重的体力劳动，从而不断提高劳动生产率，缩短施工期限，保证工程质量，降低工程成本，这是苏联铁路建设中的先进经验。铁道部第一工程局在兰新铁路施工过程中，曾经大力推行过这个经验，也提出过推广小型机械化施工的口号，以适应现有施工机械不足的情况。为保证这一新的工作顺利进行，曾采取了集中领导、统一调配施工机械的办法，以提高机械使用率。在组织工作方面，组织了专业性的机械筑路队、机械经租站和汽车运输队。这一系列的措施，使小型机械化施工具备了一定的规模，并且在乌鞘岭“移山填谷”的大量土石方工程中，在草滩、戈壁上因缺水不能更多地使用劳动力的困难工程上，表现了小型机械化施工的优越性。
    但是，令人不解的是，今年以来第一工程局的小型机械化施工不但没有向前发展，反而退后了。据统计，第一工程局机械筑路队今年一月至六月的机械使用率只达到百分之四十二，机械出勤率只达到铁道部规定出勤率的百分之三十四点九。因此，在今年前三个季度中，第一工程局都没有完成生产计划，截止八月底，仅工程价值上的亏损就达六十六万九千多元。一月到九月，第一工程局机械经租站每月平均出租的机械只占所有机械的百分之三十。汽车运输队在今年一到五月份的汽车平均出勤率也仅达计划出勤率的百分之四十点五。机械使用率和出勤率降低，就使大批机械长年积压浪费。
    为什么会造成机械使用率低、出勤率下降和长期积压浪费的现象呢？对于这个问题，各有关单位各有自己的一套看法。但是，如果认真分析一下，便不难看出这些看法都不是从主观努力上去考虑问题，而是片面地强调客观原因。如许多人认为机械陈旧，检修质量不好；有些人认为机械施工比人力施工成本高；有些人认为人比机械好管理，机械是专业的，定型的，而人可以作多样性的工作……在这些错误思想的支配下，就干脆不用机械。例如，第五工程段在修建包兰路水阜河大桥工程中，竟不用混凝土搅拌机，而用人工去拌混凝土。在大桥进入高空作业的灌注混凝土的时候，他们又叫十二个人往上拉一斗混凝土，而机械经租站却积压着十二台动力绞车。第三工程段在兰新路施工中，把桥工队现成的机械设备搁在一旁，却用人工打桩。
    是不是机械施工真的比人力施工成本高呢？不是的。一九五三年第四季度在乌鞘岭推行小型机械化施工的结果就是证明。乌鞘岭有三百多万方土石方的工程量，按照原计划，需要用十四个联合作业队和一个沙石队才能完成。但是由于推广了小型机械化施工，一般效率提高了百分之六十，最高的还达到百分之三百。结果，减少了四千五百个劳动力，只用了九个联队就完成了任务。在十一月份完成的三十四万五千七百三十七方路基土石方工程中，用机械来完成的就有三十二万方。根据兰新路岔西滩至陈家沟一段的十七公里路基施工中的统计，一台推土机在同样工作时间内可代替一百多人的工作；一台铲运机可代替二百人的工作。这就说明，小型机械施工既能提高效率，减少劳动力，当然也就降低了工程成本。
    机械陈旧是不是造成出勤率和使用率低的原因呢？也不全是这样。事实上有很多新机械照样积压。只要加强检修和保养工作，陈旧的机械同样能够为工程服务。例如，在这个工程局里，有一辆一九三六年出厂的汽车，一九五○年就被报废了。可是，在一九五二年“三反”运动中，工人们把这辆汽车修复了。一九五三年，在完成了约三千公里的运输任务后，这辆汽车又报废了。在今年开展增产节约运动中，转业军人许国斌在党组织的支持下再次把它修复。使这辆汽车不仅月月超额完成运输任务，还成为汽车运输队一百多台汽车中的“优胜车”。
    当然，在全局所有机械中，确有一部分是不能使用的。例如有些接收过来的美国机械，机器破烂，配件也没有来源。此外，也还有一部分机械是季节性的和专用的，如抽水机、鼓风机、除根机、锅炉……不能经常使用。但是，把那一部分破旧的机械彻底检查一下，其中有一部分一定可以修理好。确实不能修理好的，也应该呈准报废。但是，他们没有这样作。目前的情况是：好坏不分，坏的积压，好的也积压；坏的不爱护，好的也不爱护，加上检修和保养工作有缺点，部分机械配件缺乏，就自然给不愿使用机械施工的单位一种借口。
    至于有人认为人比机械好管理，人可作多样性的工作，这种看法当然也是不正确的。要知道，机械是由人来操纵的。只要使用得法，机械会给人节省出很多有用的劳动。因此，重要的是熟悉机械并掌握它，使之在建设中发挥出力量来，而不是把设备闲置起来，退回到用人力操作的路上去。
    由此可见，第一工程局在小型机械化施工中机械使用率和出勤率低，机械大量积压浪费的原因，决不是机械陈旧，或机械施工比人力施工成本高等问题，而是一个思想问题。确切一点说，是由于领导工作人员的思想问题。今年以来，第一工程局领导工作人员对推广小型机械化施工这一既定方针
  一直没有坚持执行。在编制施工组织设计的时候，没有根据施工单位的工程数量和性质，事先配备一定数量的机械，指定在某项工程中必须使用机械施工，对于现场单位不愿使用机械施工的情况也采取不闻不问的态度。专门负责领导小型机械施工的单位，长时期不能订出切合实际的机械使用计划，以致使机械经租站和机械修配厂在机械出租和检修工作上心中无数。而这种状况，局的领导上也没有及时予以检查和纠正。
    在整编机构的时候，第一工程局取消了附属企业处，所属机械、运输两科，由局长直接领导，这种做法，是完全正确的。但是对小型机械化研究小组的撤销，似还有商榷的必要。这个机构是在一九五四年开始大规模地推行小型机械化施工的时候，为了及时解决施工中发生的问题而设立的，并且也起到了一定的作用。如果要坚持小型机械化施工的方针并且使其不断发展，这个机构就不应该撤销。
    第一工程局领导上的这种态度在工人中引起了不良影响。比如，同是一个第五工程段，在一九五三年第四季度在乌鞘岭推行小型机械化施工中取得了很大成绩，也积累了一些经验，而在今年包兰线水阜河大桥施工中，却不愿使用机械了。在同一个汽车运输队里，有的人能把破旧的汽车加以修复并且月月超额完成任务，有的人却开着汽车在沙滩上追黄羊，以致发生了烧坏汽缸盖的事件。更严重的是还有人把三辆崭新的汽车拆毁了，其他的司机们从这三辆汽车上来“各取所需”。由于没有及时地奖励爱护国家财产的人，没有给损坏国家机械者以适当的处理，某些工作人员在机械的保管、使用和检修等工作中，产生了“不在乎”的思想。这些，难道不是由于领导工作人员不重视机械化施工和在思想上疏忽懈怠所引起的吗？
    我们认为，第一工程局机械化施工中的这种现象，不应该再继续存在下去了。
