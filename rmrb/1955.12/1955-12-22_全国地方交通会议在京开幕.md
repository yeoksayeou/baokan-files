Xinhua News Agency, December 21st. The National Local Transportation Conference opened in Beijing today.

    The main tasks of this conference are to formulate a comprehensive plan for local transportation work based on the new situation of the agricultural cooperation movement, and to study the issues of socialist transformation of capitalist transportation industry and individual transportation industry.

    Minister of Transportation Zhang Bojun gave a report at today's meeting. He said that at present, due to the vigorous development of the national agricultural cooperation and agricultural production increase movement, the entire national economy has entered a new situation of increasing prosperity. The national economy has put forward very urgent new requirements for the transportation sector in all aspects. The current task of the transportation sector is to concentrate all efforts to catch up and ensure the completion of the tasks assigned by socialist construction. It is necessary to actively develop the road network with the revolutionary spirit of socialism, harness small and medium-sized rivers, and change the situation of inconvenient transportation in our country; accelerate the completion of the socialist transformation of capitalist transportation industry and individual transportation industry; actively improve the management of transportation enterprises, implement possible technical transformation and improvement, promote advanced experience, and reduce costs and freight rates; provide large-volume, high-quality, low-cost, and fast transportation capacity for agriculture and the entire national economy, and provide convenient transportation conditions for the vast rural areas. Zhang Bojun pointed out that in order to accomplish this task, the transportation sector must conscientiously implement the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership" as instructed by Chairman Mao.

    At today's meeting, Vice Minister of Transportation Pan Qi made an explanatory report on two instruction documents regarding accelerating local transportation construction and carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist transportation industry and individual transportation industry. Pan Qi said that at present, there are only more than 147,000 kilometers of highways open to traffic nationwide, and many highways are still impassable in rainy weather. In the vast rural areas, the vast majority still rely on human and animal power to transport goods. The current backward state of transportation has affected the development of agricultural production. Pan Qi said that it is necessary to immediately carry out the construction of the road network and build a large number of various local roads suitable for the passage of local transportation tools and new agricultural implements as soon as possible; give full play to the inland river transportation industry; and accelerate the socialist transformation of capitalist transportation industry and individual transportation industry in order to adapt to the needs of the rapid development of the national economy. Pan Qi also put forward specific measures in the report to ensure the basic completion of the national road network within seven years, and requested that this meeting discuss them.

    The participants in this conference included the directors and heads of transportation departments and bureaus of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country; the heads of transportation work of the provincial and municipal committees of the Communist Party of China and the people's committees of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as representatives of relevant departments under the State Council. Vice Governors of Gansu, Guangxi, Hebei and other provinces also attended the meeting.

    全国地方交通会议在京开幕
    新华社二十一日讯　全国地方交通会议今天在北京开幕。
    这次会议的主要任务是根据农业合作化运动的新形势，制定地方交通工作的全面规划；研究资本主义运输业和个体运输业的社会主义改造问题。
    交通部部长章伯钧在今天的会上作了报告。他说，目前由于全国农业合作化和农业增产运动的蓬勃发展，整个国民经济已经进入日益高涨的新形势。国民经济已经从各个方面对交通运输部门提出了十分迫切的新要求。当前交通运输部门的任务，就是要集中一切力量迎头赶上，保证完成社会主义建设所给予的任务。必须以社会主义的革命精神积极发展道路网，整治中小河流，改变我国交通不便的情况；加速完成对资本主义运输业和个体运输业的社会主义改造；积极改进交通运输企业的经营管理，实行可能的技术改造和改良，推广先进经验，降低成本和运价；为农业和整个国民经济提供量大、质好、价廉、快速的运输力，为广大农村提供便利的交通条件。章伯钧指出，为了完成这一任务，交通运输部门必须认真地贯彻执行毛主席所指示的“全面规划，加强领导”的方针。
    在今天的会上，交通部副部长潘琪作了关于加速地方交通建设、关于对资本主义运输业及个体运输业进行社会主义改造两个指示文件的说明报告。潘琪说，现在全国已经通车的公路只有十四万七千多公里，而且有许多公路仍是晴通雨阻。在广大乡村，绝大部分还依靠人力和驮兽来运输货物。目前这种交通落后的状况，已经影响了农业生产的发展。潘琪说，必须立即开展道路网的修建工作，尽快地大量地修建适合当地运输工具和新式农具通过的各种地方道路；充分发挥内河运输事业；加速对资本主义运输业及个体运输业的社会主义改造，才能适应国民经济迅速发展的需要。潘琪在报告中还提出了保证在七年内基本建成全国道路网的具体措施，要求这次会议进行讨论。
    参加这次会议的有全国各省、市、自治区的交通厅长和局长；中共各省、市委员会和各省、市、自治区人民委员会的交通工作负责人以及国务院所属有关部门的代表，甘肃、广西、河北等省的副省长也参加了会议。
