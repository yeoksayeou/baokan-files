Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Biological Products Research Institute of the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China has successfully trial-produced Nystatin and has made achievements in improving the penicillin manufacturing method.

    Nystatin is a relatively newly discovered antibiotic. It has good therapeutic effects on diseases such as pneumonia, whooping cough, meningitis, peritonitis, typhus, erysipelas, scarlet fever, dysentery, and otitis media. Its therapeutic effect on some diseases is about five times higher than that of Aureomycin. The Biological Products Research Institute of the Ministry of Health, using the Nystatin strain and the manufacturing method introduced by the Antibiotics Research Institute of the People's Republic of Poland, and using peanut cake and soybean oil as raw materials for fermentation culture, after more than four months of repeated research, finally successfully trial-produced it.

    In the past, China relied on imported corn steep liquor and lactose as raw materials for the culture medium to manufacture penicillin, which was expensive and difficult to produce in large quantities. The Biological Products Research Institute of the Ministry of Health began researching substitutes for these raw materials in 1952. After more than a year, it successfully experimented with two methods: using cottonseed cake to replace corn steep liquor and using white corn flour to replace lactose. The former method has already begun to be applied in production, and the quality of penicillin cultivated using the latter method has not decreased, and the price can be reduced significantly. This research report was presented at the International Antibiotics Academic Conference held in the People's Republic of Poland in February of this year, and it aroused widespread attention from experts from various countries.

    Regarding the refinement method of penicillin, the Biological Products Research Institute of the Ministry of Health researched and developed a crystallization method to replace the past freeze-drying production method in 1949. It has been continuously improved since then, so that the purity of penicillin crystals has now reached a higher standard. In this way, it is not only easy to preserve, but also will not cause pain to patients during medical injection.

    我国试制地霉素成功并改进制青霉素方法
    新华社四日讯　中华人民共和国卫生部生物制品研究所试制地霉素成功，并且在改进青霉素制造方法方面取得了成绩。
    地霉素是抗生素中较新发现的一种。它对肺炎、百日咳、脑膜炎、腹膜炎、斑疹伤寒、丹毒、猩红热、痢疾、中耳炎等疾病有良好的医疗效果。对有些疾病的疗效比金霉素要高五倍左右。卫生部生物制品研究所运用波兰人民共和国抗生素研究所赠送的地霉素菌种和介绍的制造方法，以花生饼、豆油作为发酵培养基的原料，经过四个多月时间的反复研究，终于试制成功。
    过去中国制造青霉素，都是依靠外来的玉米浆、乳糖等作为培养基的原料，价格昂贵，很难大量制造。卫生部生物制品研究所在一九五二年就开始了研究这些原料的代用品。经过一年多的时间，试验成功用棉籽饼代替玉米浆，用白玉米面代替乳糖两种办法。前一种办法已经开始应用在生产上，用后一种办法培养出来的青霉素，质量没有降低，价格可以减低很多。这个研究报告，曾在今年二月间波兰人民共和国召开的国际抗生素学术会议上作过介绍，引起了各国专家们广泛的重视。
    在青霉素的提炼方法上，卫生部生物制品研究所一九四九年曾研究出用结晶方法代替过去的冷冻干燥产生法，以后又不断地改进，使青霉素结晶纯度现在已达到了较高标准。这样，既然便于保存，在医疗注射时，病人也不会产生疼痛的感觉。
