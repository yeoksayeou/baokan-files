    Beijing Electric Power Bureau, based on the plan for realizing agricultural production cooperativization in the suburbs of Beijing, recently planned to build two substations in the suburbs within seven years. Recently, technicians from the Electric Power Bureau went to the Hongxing Collective Farm in the Nan Yuan District and eight areas including Huaifang and Zhenguosi to survey the power transmission lines.

    After the completion of these two substations, a portion of the 650,000 mu of cultivated land in the suburbs of Beijing will be cultivated by electric tractors. 470,000 mu of paddy fields, vegetable gardens, and irrigated land can be irrigated with electricity. Agricultural production cooperatives can use electric machinery to replace manual labor for seed selection, threshing, chopping straw, and milking. Every member of the cooperative will be able to use electric lights for illumination.

    This year, the cultivated land of twenty-five agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing has already begun to be irrigated with electricity. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京计划送电到农业合作社
    北京电业局最近根据北京市郊区实现农业生产合作化的规划，计划七年内在郊区建设两座变电站。最近，电业局的技术人员到南苑区红星集体农庄和槐房、镇国寺八个地区，勘察了输送电的线路。
    这两座变电站建成以后，北京郊区六十五万亩机耕土地上，将有一部分土地用电动拖拉机进行耕作。有四十七万亩水稻、菜园和水浇土地可用电力灌溉。农业生产合作社可用电力机械代替人工来选种、脱谷、铡草和挤奶。每户社员都可用电灯照明。
    今年，北京郊区已经有二十五个农业生产合作社的耕地开始用电力进行灌溉。  （新华社）
