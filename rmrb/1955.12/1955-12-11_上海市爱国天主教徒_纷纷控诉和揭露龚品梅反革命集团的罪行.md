Shanghai's broad masses of patriotic Catholics, with irrepressible anger, are denouncing and exposing the crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique, which was hidden within the Catholic Church. From mid-September to early November, nearly 50,000 Catholics in 31 districts of the city held dozens of meetings of various sizes, and more than 10,000 Catholics used facts they had seen, heard, and personally experienced to denounce and expose the crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique. These accusers included Catholics living in various districts and holding various social occupations.

Li Wenbiao, a member of the Catholic "Gongjiao Qingnian" (Catholic Youth) who had been poisoned and used by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique, revealed the following facts: The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique instructed members of the city's "Gong Qing" and "Catechism Groups" to use religious phrases to openly curse the Communist Party and the People's Government as "enemies," and to slander the new China after liberation as a "dark world," saying that "Jesus rebukes the evil party," and calling on "Gong Qing" and "Catechism Group" members to be "brave soldiers of Jesus," inciting them to "advance bravely on the path of the cross" (referring to resisting the Communist Party and the People's Government). Hu Fangming, an elderly Catholic in his seventies, said indignantly: These counter-revolutionary elements even inserted phrases like "Today in China, we are in dire straits" into hymns such as the "Appeals to Our Lady of Fatima." Catholics in the Longhua district, in their denunciations, also revealed that Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique member Fu Hezhou openly promoted the power of American atomic bombs to Catholics in the Qibao Catholic Church, clamoring for war. Many Catholics pointed out in their denunciations that the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique also organized a picket team unrelated to religion within the Catholic Church, printed a large number of reactionary leaflets, and forced Catholics to sing reactionary songs. In the church, one could not see the harmony that should be there, but instead, it was filled with threats, deception, and terror.

Xiong Bingchen, a Catholic in the Songshan district and the father of nine children, accused the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique of corrupting his two sons. One of them, Xiong Guoliang, openly opposed Xiong Bingchen's participation in the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, and even expressed his intention to be "sworn enemies" with his father. Xiong Bingchen's other son, Xiong Yinghua, while studying at Shanghai Second Medical College, did not participate in any patriotic activities, and even joined a group of "Gong Qing" members to surround the school's Youth League committee, staging a "demonstration." Due to these illegal activities, Xiong Yinghua was expelled from the school. Xiong Bingchen said: "My son was a zealous youth who participated in the anti-hunger and anti-civil war movement before liberation, but after liberation, he was poisoned by the Gong Pinmei's bloodless killing counter-revolutionary clique." He said: "When my son was expelled from school and felt sorry for his parents, and saw his future lost and was in great pain, the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique shamelessly 'praised' him as 'suffering for God,' and told him to 'resist bravely and prepare to serve,' warning him 'not to accuse the priests.'"

Li Yuehua, a nun who worked at the Catholic Renai (Charity) Society on Chongqing South Road for more than ten years, accused the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique of illegally imprisoning Sister Shu Haiyun in a private prison for as long as ten months. Li Yuehua said: "I really couldn't imagine that in a religious order named for charity, the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique would commit such acts of infringing on human rights and being inhumane." Gu Pingsheng, a Catholic at the Datong Road Catholic Church whose family had been Catholic for seven generations, was beaten and persecuted by Zhang Xibin and other members of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique who controlled the church because he truthfully told the government about a person of unknown origin who had been hiding in the church for a long time without registering his household. Gu Pingsheng said: "They beat me until I was bruised and bleeding, and called me a 'dog,' 'beast,' and 'apostate,' forcing me to confess my sins within a few minutes."

Catholics throughout the city also revealed a large number of facts about how the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique tried every means to impose various religious punishments on Catholics who participated in patriotic activities. Catholics were forbidden to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day and National Day parades, forbidden to participate in the country's general election work, neighborhood work, and organizations such as the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and children were forbidden to join the Young Pioneers. Xu Baoshan, a sixty-year-old Catholic, accused the First Veterans' Home of unreasonably depriving several elderly Catholics of the right to hold religious services and receive Holy Communion because they had served as electoral group leaders in the general election movement. Ma Dexiu, a female Catholic in the Xuhui district, was also given the excommunication punishment of "breaking the four precepts" for participating in neighborhood work. In the Xuhui district alone, there were more than 200 Catholics who had been punished by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique using "divine power" for participating in patriotic activities themselves or allowing their children to join the Young Pioneers. Over the past three months, the broad masses of Catholics have sharpened their eyes in denouncing the crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique. They unanimously support the correct measures taken by the government to arrest and try counter-revolutionary criminals such as Gong Pinmei, and demand that the government severely punish these criminals. Jiang Xiuzhen, an elderly Catholic, cried at a denunciation meeting: "They (referring to the members of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique) are not our priests, but enemies of the people. I ask the government to severely punish them." At a meeting attended by more than 14,000 Catholics, Yang Shida, vice president of Shanghai Second Medical College and a Catholic, said: "The wise government has arrested a group of traitors hidden in the Catholic Church. Our priests and Catholics have seen the light of day again." At the denunciation meetings held in various districts and communities, the broad masses of Catholics unanimously expressed their determination to draw a clear line with the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique, stand in the ranks of loving the country and the Church, and strive to thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the Catholic Church and purify the Church.

    上海市爱国天主教徒
    纷纷控诉和揭露龚品梅反革命集团的罪行
    上海市广大的爱国天主教徒以不可抑制的愤怒心情纷纷控诉和揭露暗藏在天主教内的龚品梅反革命集团的罪行。自九月中旬到十一月上旬，全市三十一个区的近五万名天主教徒，已分别举行了数十次大小集会，有一万多名天主教徒以所见所闻和亲身遭遇的事实，控诉和揭露龚品梅反革命集团的罪行。这些控诉的人中包括了住在各区的担任各种不同社会职业的教徒。
    曾经受龚品梅反革命集团毒害和利用的天主教“公教青年”分子李文?揭露了下列的事实：龚品梅反革命集团指使全市“公青”和“教理小组”分子运用宗教词句，公开咒骂共产党和人民政府是“敌人”，诬蔑解放后的新中国是“黑暗世界”，说什么“耶稣怒斥恶党”，要“公青”和“教理小组”分子做“耶稣的勇兵”，煽动他们“要在十字架的征途上（指反抗共产党和人民政府）勇敢前进”。七十多岁的老教徒胡芳铭愤慨地说：这批反革命分子甚至像在“呼吁法蒂玛圣母诵”这样的经文中，也插上了什么“今我中国，水深火热”的词句。龙华区教徒在控诉中，还揭露了龚品梅反革命集团分子傅鹤洲公开向七宝天主堂教徒宣传美国原子弹的威力，叫嚣战争。许多教徒在控诉中都指出龚品梅反革命集团还在天主教堂内组织了与宗教毫不相干的纠察队，大量印发反动传单，强迫教徒唱反动歌曲。在教堂里一点也看不到应有的和谐气氛，而是充满着威胁、欺骗和恐怖。
    有九个孩子的父亲、嵩山区教徒熊秉辰控诉说，他的两个儿子由于受龚品梅反革命集团的毒害而堕落了。其中的一个叫熊国良，竟公开反对熊秉辰参加反帝爱国运动，还表示要同父亲“誓不两立”。熊秉辰的另一个儿子叫熊膺华，在上海第二医学院读书的时候，不参加任何爱国活动，还和一批
  “公青”分子一起去包围学校的青年科，举行“示威”。由于这些不法活动，熊膺华被学校开除了。熊秉辰说：“我的儿子是曾经参加解放前的反饥饿反内战运动的热血青年，在解放后却被龚品梅这杀人不见血的反革命集团毒害了。”他说：“当我的儿子被学校开除而觉得对不起父母，又眼看自己的前途丧失而痛苦万分的时候，龚品梅反革命集团分子却无耻地‘夸奖’他是‘为天主受难’，还要他‘勇敢反抗，准备效命’，警告他‘不得控诉神长’”。
    在重庆南路天主教仁爱会做了十多年修女的李月华，控诉了龚品梅反革命集团私设监牢非法监禁修女舒海云达十个月之久的罪行。李月华说：“我真想不到在一个以仁爱为名的修会内，龚品梅反革命集团却干出了这种侵犯人权、惨无人道的事情来。”大通路天主堂教徒顾平生家连续七代信天主教，因为他忠实地向政府说出长期躲藏在教堂内的一个来路不明又不报户口的人，竟遭到了把持这个教堂的龚品梅反革命集团分子张希斌等人的殴打和迫害。顾平生说：“他们把我打得皮破血流，骂我是‘狗’、‘畜生’，是‘叛教徒’，强逼我在几分钟以内要认罪。”
    全市的天主教徒还揭发了龚品梅反革命集团千方百计地给予参加爱国活动的教徒以各种宗教上的处罚的大量事实。教徒们被禁止参加每年“五一”国际劳动节和国庆节的示威游行，被禁止参加国家的普选工作、里弄工作以及中苏友好协会等组织，孩子们被禁止参加少年先锋队。六十岁的老教徒徐宝山控诉说，第一残老院的几个老年教徒，都因为在普选运动中担任了选民小组长，被无理剥夺了办神功和领圣体的权利。徐汇区女教友马德修，也因参加了里弄工作而遭到“断四规”的绝罚。仅在徐汇区一地，因自己参加爱国活动或允许自己的子女加入少年先锋队而被龚品梅反革命集团利用“神权”给予处罚的教徒就有二百多人。三个月来，广大的天主教徒在控诉龚品梅反革命集团罪行中擦亮了眼睛，他们一致拥护政府将龚品梅等反革命罪犯加以逮捕审讯的正确措施，要求政府对这些罪犯严厉惩办。老教徒江秀贞在声讨大会上哭着说：“他们（指龚品梅反革命集团分子）不是我们的神父，而是人民的敌人，我要求政府严办他们。”在一次有一万四千多教徒参加的大会上，上海第二医学院副院长、教徒杨士达说：“英明的政府已经把暗藏在天主教内的一伙祖国叛徒逮捕起来了，我们的神长和教友，重见了天日。”在各区各界举行的声讨大会上，广大的天主教徒们一致表示要和龚品梅反革命集团划清界限，站到爱国爱教的队伍中来，为彻底肃清隐藏在天主教内的一切反革命分子纯洁教会而努力。　（新华社）（附图片）
