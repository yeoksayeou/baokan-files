    The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl, visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from December 18th to 22nd. During the visit, Prime Minister Grotewohl and Premier Kim Il-sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea exchanged views and issued a joint communique on December 21st. In the joint communique, the two governments stated that they have completely identical views on the peaceful settlement of the Korean and German questions to guarantee world peace. In the joint communique, the two governments reiterated their respect for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and expressed their sincere desire to further develop the friendship between the two countries.
    The friendly visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as the joint communique issued by the two governments, will not only enhance the fraternal friendship and ties between the two countries, but also help consolidate peace in Europe and Asia. The Chinese people express warm welcome and support for this.
    Although the German Democratic Republic and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are located in Europe and Asia, and there is a long spatial distance between the two countries, the people of the two countries are closely linked in spirit and in the goals they are striving for. This is not only because the people of the two countries are working hard to build a socialist society, a common and noble cause, but also because their countries are in a situation where they are artificially divided into two parts, and they are both fighting for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. In this struggle for the reunification of their motherland, the people of the two countries face the same enemies, take the same path of struggle, and equally recognize the great role of their struggle in safeguarding world peace. This consistency in the common goal of building socialism, especially in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, makes the German and Korean people feel even more the need for mutual support and mutual assistance. Therefore, the joint communique issued by Prime Minister Grotewohl and Premier Kim Il-sung cannot but be of great significance.
    Due to the "Cold War" policy pursued by the United States after the Second World War, Germany and Korea were artificially divided into two parts after the war and have not been unified for a long time. The United States used the division it created in Germany and Korea to create tension in Europe and Asia.
    In Europe, the United States actively rearmed West Germany, revived German militarism, and dragged West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc through the Paris Agreement. At the same time, the United States, disregarding the efforts of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, and ignoring the will of the German people, has been doing its utmost to hinder the peaceful reunification of Germany. The United States is attempting to deepen the division of Germany and Europe, and to prevent the establishment of a European collective security system, in order to maintain tension in Europe and continue the "Cold War."
    Similarly, in Asia, the United States uses the maintenance of the division of Korea to create tension in Asia and threaten peace in Asia. The US policy of splitting Korea led to the Korean War. After the Korean armistice, the United States, on the one hand, disregarded the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and China, and refused to peacefully reunify Korea at the 1954 Geneva Conference. On the other hand, it actively strengthened the armed forces of the Syngman Rhee clique, repeatedly violated the armistice agreement, and even attempted to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, undermining the stability of the Korean armistice. In doing so, the United States has made no secret of its intention to turn southern Korea into a base for aggression.
    It is quite clear that the struggle of the German and Korean people for the reunification of their motherland is also a struggle against US aggression and for the guarantee of world peace. This is the common cause of all peace-loving people in the world. Because of this, the struggle of the German and Korean people has received the concern, sympathy, and support of the people of all countries.
    Prime Minister Grotewohl and Premier Kim Il-sung correctly pointed out in the joint communique that the presence of foreign troops in Korea and Germany is a huge obstacle to the unification of Korea and Germany, and all foreign troops must be withdrawn from Korea and Germany as soon as possible. The communique stated that the unification of Korea and Germany must be realized by the Korean and German people themselves on a democratic basis and by peaceful means. To this end, it is necessary to eliminate the distrust and tension existing between North and South Korea and between East and West Germany, and to achieve mutual rapprochement and consultations on unification. The two governments also believe that in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, it is necessary to convene an international conference attended by countries related to the Korean issue as soon as possible. In order to pave the way for the peaceful reunification of Germany on a democratic basis, it is necessary to establish a European collective security system. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government of the German Democratic Republic have already made many efforts in these areas and have put forward many positive suggestions. The Chinese people fully support these proposals and are willing to work to promote the realization of these proposals.
    The Chinese people have always had a deep friendship with the Korean and German people. In the struggle to safeguard world peace, the Chinese people have consistently worked for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and resolutely support the German people's struggle against the revival of German militarism and for the reunification of Germany. As Prime Minister Grotewohl and Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out in the joint communique, "No force can continue to prevent Korea and Germany from being reunited into a peace-loving, democratic, and independent country." The Chinese people firmly believe that the struggle of the Korean and German people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely be victorious, because this struggle of the Korean and German people is just, and because the sympathy of the whole world is on the side of the Korean and German people.

### 朝鲜和德国人民统一祖国的斗争必定胜利

    朝鲜和德国人民统一祖国的斗争必定胜利
    以奥托·格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团在十二月十八日到二十二日访问了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。在访问期间，格罗提渥总理和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国金日成首相互相交换了意见，并在十二月二十一日发表了联合公报。两国政府在联合公报中表明：它们对于和平解决朝鲜问题和德国问题以保障世界和平有着完全一致的意见。两国政府在联合公报中重申了它们对于和平共处的五项原则的尊重，并且表达了进一步发展两国之间的友谊的真诚愿望。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的友好访问，以及两国政府所发表的联合公报，不但将增进两国之间的兄弟般的友谊和联系，并且将有助于巩固欧洲和亚洲的和平。中国人民对此表示热烈的欢迎和支持。
    德意志民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国虽然分处欧亚两洲，两国之间有着遥远的空间上的距离，但是两国人民在精神上和他们为之而奋斗的目标上却是密切地联系在一起的。这不仅是因为两国人民都在为建设社会主义社会这个共同的崇高的事业而努力，而且还因为他们的国家都处在被人为地分裂成两部分的情况下，他们都在为祖国的和平统一而斗争。在这个为统一祖国而进行的斗争中，两国人民面对着同样的敌人，走着同样的斗争的道路，并且同样地认识到他们的斗争在保障世界和平的事业中的巨大作用。这种为建设社会主义的共同目标特别是为祖国和平统一而斗争的一致性，使得德国人民和朝鲜人民之间更加感觉到有互相声援、互相支持的必要。因此，格罗提渥总理和金日成首相所发表的联合公报不能不具有重大的意义。
    由于美国在第二次世界大战以后所推行的“冷战”政策，德国和朝鲜在战后都被人为地分割成两个部分，并且长期不能得到统一。美国利用它在德国和朝鲜一手造成的分裂局面，在欧洲和亚洲制造紧张局势。
    在欧洲方面，美国积极重新武装西德，复活德国军国主义，并且通过巴黎协定把西德拖进北大西洋侵略集团。同时，美国又不顾苏联和德意志民主共和国的努力，无视德国人民的意志，竭力阻挠德国的和平统一。美国企图这样来加深德国以及欧洲的分裂，阻挠欧洲集体安全体系的建立，以达到在欧洲保持紧张局势、继续进行“冷战”的目的。
    同样，美国在亚洲用保持朝鲜的分裂来制造亚洲紧张局势，威胁亚洲的和平。美国分裂朝鲜的政策导致了朝鲜战争，而在朝鲜停战以后，美国一方面不顾朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以及苏联、中国的努力，在一九五四年的日内瓦会议上拒绝和平统一朝鲜，另一方面积极加强李承晚集团的武装力量，并且屡次违反停战协定，甚至企图取消中立国监察委员会，破坏朝鲜停战的稳定。美国在这样做的时候，毫不掩饰地表露了它要把朝鲜南部变成侵略基地的打算。
    十分明显，德国人民和朝鲜人民为争取祖国统一而进行的斗争，也就是反对美国侵略、保障世界和平的斗争。这是全世界爱好和平的人民的共同事业。正因为这样，德国人民和朝鲜人民的斗争受到了各国人民的关切、同情和支持。
    格罗提渥总理和金日成首相在联合公报中正确地指出，外国军队驻留在朝鲜和德国境内，是对朝鲜和德国统一的巨大障碍，一切外国军队必须迅速从朝鲜和德国境内撤出。公报中说，朝鲜和德国的统一必须由朝鲜人民和德国人民自己在民主的基础上以和平方法来实现。为此，有必要消除分别存在于南北朝鲜和东西德之间的不信任和紧张局势，实现为争取相互间的接近和关于统一的协商。两国政府并且认为，为了和平解决朝鲜问题，有必要尽可能迅速地召开与朝鲜问题有关的国家参加的国际会议。为了铺平在民主基础上重新和平统一德国的道路，有必要建立欧洲集体安全体系。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府已经在这些方面作了很多努力，提出了不少积极性的建议。中国人民完全支持这些建议，并且愿意为促使这些建议的实现而努力。
    中国人民同朝鲜人民和德国人民一向有着深厚的友谊。中国人民在为保障世界和平而进行的斗争中，一贯地为实现朝鲜问题的和平解决而努力，并且坚决支持德国人民反对德国军国主义的复活和争取德国统一的斗争。正如格罗提渥总理和金日成首相在联合公报中所指出的，“任何力量也不能继续阻挠朝鲜和德国重新统一成为一个爱好和平的民主独立的国家”。中国人民坚决相信，朝鲜人民和德国人民争取祖国和平统一的斗争必然将获得胜利，因为朝鲜和德国人民的这个斗争是正义的，因为全世界的同情都在朝鲜和德国人民方面。
