Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: To date, in Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Guangdong, Henan provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, several hundred agricultural production cooperatives have implemented a mail carrier system, with a total of over 300 mail carriers.

The mail carrier system is implemented in roughly two forms. One is where a large agricultural production cooperative sets up a mail carrier independently; the other is where several agricultural production cooperatives jointly establish a mail carrier. The implementation of the mail carrier system is always approved by the members' assembly. Implementing this method generally involves designating someone with certain qualifications to be specifically responsible for receiving, sending, and delivering newspapers, periodicals, and letters. The cooperative allots work points based on the time spent on postal work, with the remaining time still available for participation in the cooperative's production.

Cadres and members are very satisfied with the mail carrier system. Cadres in Daling Township, Huguan County, Shanxi Province, said that this method provides "four satisfactions": First, township cadres are satisfied because the township People's Committee does not need to send extra labor to deliver letters to villages and cooperatives. Second, the masses are satisfied because newspapers and letters are delivered to their homes, and they do not need to go out to mail letters. Third, township schools and enterprises receive newspapers and letters in a timely manner. Fourth, the mail carrier earns work points for delivering newspapers and letters, which is fair and reasonable.

The agricultural production cooperative mail carrier system is called the collective farm mail carrier system in the Soviet Union and has been implemented for over 20 years. It is an advanced system that can both reduce the staffing of national postal and telecommunications enterprises and provide more thorough service to farmers. Trial implementation began this year in some areas of our country, and experience has now been gained. This system will be widely promoted throughout the country in 1956.

Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: To date, more than 760 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide have installed telephones. In addition to the two agricultural production cooperatives led by Li Shunda and Geng Changsuo, which already had telephones, the Hongxing Collective Farm in the suburbs of Beijing, the Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liaoning, the Liming Collective Farm in Jilin, and the Chifeng Wusan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Rehe have also installed telephones.

Guangxi and Guangdong provinces have the most agricultural production cooperatives with telephones, with over 200 each. Sichuan, Yunnan, Henan, Jiangxi, Hunan, and other provinces also have several dozen each. The number of agricultural production cooperatives with telephones is constantly increasing. After installing telephones, contact between agricultural production cooperatives and counties, districts, and townships, the transmission of weather changes, and the resolution of urgent matters have all been facilitated, which is conducive to the improvement of rural work and the increase of agricultural production.

In addition, more than 800 state-owned farms, 60 tractor stations, and 48 water conservancy irrigation management stations across the country have also installed telephones.

    全国有几百个农业合作社实行邮递员制度  
    七百多个农业合作社已经装上电话
    新华社二十八日讯　到目前为止，在山东、山西、四川、黑龙江、江西、辽宁、广东、河南等省和内蒙古自治区，已经有好几百个农业生产合作社实行了邮递员制度，共有邮递员三百多人。
    已经实行邮递员制度的大致有两种形式。一种是一个大型农业生产合作社单独设立一个邮递员；另一种是几个农业生产合作社联合起来设立一个邮递员。实行邮递员制度，都是经过社员大会通过的。实行这个办法，一般都指定一个有一定条件的人专门负责报刊信件的收寄和投递，根据他作邮递工作的时间，由社里评工分，其余的时间仍可参加社里的生产。
    干部和社员对邮递员制度都很满意。山西省壶关县大令乡的干部说，这个办法是四满意：一是乡干部满意，乡人民委员会给村、社送信不用另外派工；二是群众满意，报纸和信件送到家，寄信不用出门；三是乡里的学校、企业及时收到报刊信件；四是邮递员本人送报送信算工分，公平合理。
    农业生产合作社邮递员制度在苏联叫集体农庄邮递员制度，已经实行了二十多年。它是一个先进的制度，既可以减少国家邮电企业的编制，又可以更周到地为农民服务。我国某些地区今年试行，现在已经取得经验，全国各地一九五六年将普遍推行这个制度。
    新华社二十八日讯　到目前为止，全国已经有七百六十多个农业生产合作社装上了电话。除李顺达、耿长锁领导的两个农业生产合作社早已装了电话以外，北京郊区红星集体农庄、辽宁高坎村农业生产合作社、吉林黎明集体农庄、热河赤峰五三农业生产合作社等，也都装了电话。
    装电话的农业生产合作社以广西、广东两省为最多，各有二百多个；四川、云南、河南、江西、湖南等省也各有几十个。目前装电话的农业生产合作社的数目正在不断增加。装了电话以后，对农业生产合作社和县、区、乡的工作联系，气象变化的传达，急事的解决，都提供了便利条件，有助于农村工作的改进和农业生产的增加。
    另外，全国还有八百多个国营农场、六十个拖拉机站和四十八个水利灌溉管理所也都装上了电话。
