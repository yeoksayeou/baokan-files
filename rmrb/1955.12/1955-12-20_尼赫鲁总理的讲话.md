Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 19th - Indian Prime Minister Nehru, speaking at a city-wide reception held by the Delhi Municipal Committee at the Red Fort for Soong Ching Ling on December 18th, said:

	“I would like to say a few words as a citizen of the Republic of India. The reason I choose this particular identity is because all of you and hundreds of millions of my fellow countrymen and women share this same identity with me, and I believe that in what I say, I represent the hopes and feelings of these hundreds of millions of my fellow countrymen and women. (Cheers)

	“You have come here as a great leader of a great nation. If I may be so bold as to say, you are even more than that in our hearts. (Cheers) What kind of person are you in our minds and in the minds of many others? For the past thirty years or so, we have heard about you, we have read about you, and we have been trying to pay attention to what you have said and what you have done and what you have not done. During the entire stormy period of the Chinese Revolution, many famous figures emerged, but no matter what storms raged in China, your image stood firm, calm, confident, and unwavering throughout those long years. (Cheers)

	“Therefore, you are not only as firm as a rock, but you have also become a beacon of light for others, not only for your own people, but also for our people, and I am sure, for the people of many other countries as well. Therefore, we do not admire you superficially, but we admire you from the depths of our hearts. Now we have the honor of meeting you in person and talking with you, and the scenes of the past few years flash before our eyes, and we are deeply moved. Therefore, Madam, I want to express our respect and enthusiasm to you on behalf of our people and our country." (Warm applause)

	Then, Nehru asked: “What was our situation ten years ago, what was the situation of you and me and this dear guest? Ten and a half years ago, I was in Ahmednagar (Ahmednagar Fort Prison). And China, there was war, all kinds of suffering, chaos, and destruction. The war lasted for many years, and there was also foreign aggression. In these ten years, how much prosperity and decline have we seen in China and India! It would take a long time to tell. These ten years can perhaps be considered longer and more significant than several centuries. Perhaps, the people of our country living in the present will not realize the great changes of these ten years. However, this historical climax, this torrent of the times, has changed the face of the world."

	Nehru said that India and China are two major countries that account for nearly half of the world's population. Merely having a large population does not make a country strong and powerful. Sometimes even small countries can become strong and have an influential force. "But the fact today is that these two countries are free and independent. They follow their own paths, have their own opinions, and they must not only have an impact on their own people, but also on the people of other countries."

	Referring to the attitude of some Western countries towards Asian countries, the Indian Prime Minister said that although two major revolutions have taken place in India and China, some people still cling to their old ideas and refuse to recognize this huge change. China, a large country with 600 million people, is today moving forward under the leadership of a strong government, following its own path. This is a fundamental fact that no one can dispute. "But you know, some governments and some countries and their leaders disagree with this. It is very strange that a country like China, which accounts for one-third of the world's population, seems to be non-existent in the minds of these people. They say that for them, China does not exist. If they close their eyes like this, how can people solve the world's major problems?"

	Nehru said that if these "minority countries" faced the facts and recognized China, then many problems in the world would certainly have been solved long ago, or at least handled correctly. "It is very strange that the doors of the United Nations are closed to a country like China. In fact, this does not do much harm to China, but it does do great harm to the United Nations. This is because the decisions of the United Nations are not binding on China, and China has no representative there. The United Nations was established to include all countries in the world. But if a large country with such a large area and population as China is excluded from the United Nations, then this international organization is weakened, and it therefore cannot say in front of others that it represents the whole world."

	The Indian Prime Minister said that he often felt that if China had obtained its due position in the United Nations, many of the difficulties faced by Southeast Asia might not have occurred. If these problems had still occurred, then their solution would have been much easier.

	Nehru expressed his pleasure at the United Nations' acceptance of sixteen new member states. He expressed his regret that Mongolia and Japan were not accepted by the United Nations. He said that he hoped that they would soon become members of this international organization. Nehru pointed out: Japan is a major country and should have a representative there. Mongolia is not such a major country, but it is an independent country. We have relatively close relations with it. It would be better if these two countries were accepted into the United Nations along with the other sixteen countries. Nehru said that India has decided to establish diplomatic relations with Mongolia in the next few days.

	Talking about the current situation where Chiang Kai-shek elements are stealing China's seat in the United Nations, Nehru said that regarding the issue of China's representation in the United Nations, someone raised the question of "who is China." China is right here, and if anyone has any doubts about this, then he can look at the map and convince himself of this. It is indeed a strange thing that some people cannot see such a large country. Their difficulty lies in the fact that they think China is on the small island of Taiwan. "This is a wrong view. When the foundation of something is not right, how can the superstructure built on it be proper? This is a very basic question for everyone except those who consider themselves very clever."

	Nehru said that these "extremely clever people" also seem not to understand India's foreign policy. Perhaps there is one reason for this: it is a clear policy, a straightforward policy, with nothing hidden in between. Therefore, this policy has not only brought many benefits to India, but also to some other regions of the world, and it is also beneficial to world peace. "We are not willing to use some of our keen intelligence to deceive others, or to make them stumble. Our policy is not like the policies of some countries, which seem to treat the world as a chessboard for activities. It was these masters of chess games who dragged the world into two world wars that caused great disasters. But they still want us to accept their activities. We do not understand this trick of international chess games. We want to make our policy clear and clear so that the whole world can see it, and there are no hidden motives behind it."

	Nehru warned Western countries that the era in which they could decide the "fate of Asia" was long gone. He said that Asian countries, with the exception of a few, have already gained independence, and now it is up to the people of Asia to decide their own destiny.

	Nehru said that the "old brains" and "these old ideas" of some people in Western countries are responsible for many of the disputes in the world. It is for this reason that these people do not understand the "spirit of Asia" and do not understand what changes have taken place in the minds of the people of various Asian countries in recent times.

	He went on to say that in Indochina, a useless war had been going on for seven or eight years. It was a sin to wage that war. Not long ago, people took some decisions to stop this conflict and bring peace to the region. These decisions could have been taken seven years ago.

	Nehru said that if countries abide by the "international code of ethics" based on "Panchsheel" (i.e., the Five Principles), world problems could be greatly reduced.

	Referring to the reaction of Western countries to the growing friendship between India and China and between India and the Soviet Union, Nehru said that this friendship is being interpreted as India's hostility towards those Western countries. It is very surprising to take this attitude. Nehru said, "China is our friend. India and China are both large countries, and both countries are following their respective paths to achieve the goal of independence. We respect each other. We are always willing to learn from each other, and we hope to develop the closest relations between us. This does not mean that we start imitating each other, but we certainly hope to learn from each other on a friendly basis. We also hope to strive for each other's respect and goodwill without interfering in each other's internal affairs. But, this does not mean that because we are getting closer, we will become enemies of some other countries. Why do some people interpret this friendship as hostility towards them? We do not want to be hostile to anyone. I believe that we are not hostile to anyone, nor will we allow this hostility towards anyone to arise."

	Nehru mentioned the visit of Soviet leaders to India, saying that the Soviet leaders were given a grand welcome in India. They were treated as honored guests, and their visit, like his visit to the Soviet Union, helped to make the relationship between India and the Soviet Union closer. The two countries will help each other economically and culturally, and the two countries will share their benefits. "There is no question of generating hostility towards anyone in this matter. Some countries believe that because India welcomed the Soviet leaders, it has alienated them and established ties with others. This is a completely wrong view. What they may mean is that if we want their friendship, then we should become enemies of others. How is this possible, because we are not enemies of anyone. We want to gain the friendship of all countries." Nehru concluded by saying that India is determined to establish the closest relations with its great neighbor China. (Cheers)

    尼赫鲁总理的讲话
    新华社新德里十九日讯　印度总理尼赫鲁十二月十八日在德里市政委员会在红堡为宋庆龄举行的全市欢迎会上发表讲话说：
    “我愿意以印度共和国公民的身份说几句话。我所以选择这个特殊的身份，是因为你们大家和我国几亿的男女同胞都和我具有这个同样身份，我认为，在我所说的话中，我就代表了我们这几亿男女同胞的希望和感情。（欢呼声）
    “你是作为伟大国家的伟大领导人到这里来的。如果我可以冒昧地这样说，你在我们的心目中甚至超过了那个程度。（欢呼声）在我们和其他许多人的心目中，你是怎样一个人呢？在过去三十年左右，我们听到关于你的事，我们读到关于你的消息，我们一直在设法注意你所说的话以及你所做的事和你所不做的事。在中国革命的整个暴风雨的时期中，产生了许多有名人物，但是不论在中国掀起什么样的风暴，在这些漫长的年代中你的形象屹立着，沉着，自信，意志坚定，从不动摇。（欢呼声）
    “因此，你不仅坚如磐石，而且成为给予别人以光明的灯塔，不仅给予你本国人民以光明，而且给予我国人民以光明，同时我确信，还给予许多其他国家的人民以光明。因此，我们不是表面上敬爱你，而是从心灵深处敬爱你，现在我们荣幸地亲自见到了你而且同你会谈，过去几年来的情景就在我们眼前掠过，我们深深受到感动。因此，女士，我要代表我们的人民和国家向您表示我们的敬意和热诚。”（热烈的掌声）
    接着，尼赫鲁问道：“十年以前我们是怎样的情形呢，你们和我以及这位亲爱的来宾都是怎样的情形呢？十年半以前，我在阿迈德纳加（阿迈德纳加堡监狱）。而中国呢，那里有战争，有各种各样的苦难，有混乱和破坏。战争延续了好几年，还有外来的外国侵略。在这十年中，我们在中国和印度这两个地方看到多少盛衰兴亡的事啊！真是说来话长，这十年的光阴也许可以被认为比几世纪的光阴更长、意义也更重大。也许，生活在目前的我国人民不会觉察到这十年内的巨大改变。但是，这种历史高潮，这种时势的洪流，已经改变了世界的面貌。”
    尼赫鲁说，印度和中国是将近占世界人口的一半的两个大国。仅仅由于人口的众多并不使国家强而有力。有时甚至小国也能变得强有力和具有有影响的力量。“但是今天的事实是，这两个国家是自由和独立的。它们遵循着它们自己的道路，有它们自己的见解，它们一定不仅对它们自己的人民发生影响，而且也对其他国家的人民发生影响。”
    印度总理在提到一些西方国家对亚洲国家的态度的时候说，虽然在印度和中国发生了两次巨大的革命，有些人仍然坚持他们的旧思想而不肯承认这种巨大的变化。拥有六亿人民的大国中国今天在强有力的政府领导下遵循着它自己的道路向前迈进。这是谁也不能争辩的基本事实。“但是你们知道，一些政府和一些国家以及它们的领袖们却不同意这一点。非常奇怪的是，像占世界人口三分之一的中国这样的国家在这些人的心目中似乎是不存在的。他们说，对于他们说来，中国是不存在的。如果他们这样地闭上他们的眼睛，那么人们如何能解决世界的大问题呢？”
    尼赫鲁说，如果这些“少数国家”面对事实，承认中国，那么世界上的许多问题一定早就得到了解决或至少得到了正确的处理。“很奇怪，联合国的大门会对像中国这样的国家闭而不开。实际上，这对中国并没有多大损害，但是这的确对联合国有很大的损害。这是因为联合国的决定对中国没有约束力，中国没有代表在那里。联合国是要包括世界上一切国家而建立起来的。但是如果像中国这样面积广大和人口众多的大国被排斥在联合国以外，那么这个国际机构就削弱了，它也因此不能在其他人面前说，它代表着全世界。”
    印度总理说，他常常觉得，如果中国在联合国得到了它应有的地位，东南亚面临的许多困难本来可能不会发生的。如果这些问题还是发生了，那么它们的解决就要容易得多。
    尼赫鲁对联合国接纳了十六个新会员国表示高兴。他对蒙古和日本没有被联合国接纳表示抱歉。他说，希望它们将很快变成这个国际组织的会员国。尼赫鲁指出：日本是一个大国，应该有代表在那里。蒙古并不是这样的一个大国，但是它是一个独立的国家。我们同它有着比较接近的关系。如果这两个国家同其他十六个国家一同被联合国接纳的话，那就更好。尼赫鲁说，印度已经决定在今后几天内同蒙古建立外交关系。
    谈到现在蒋介石分子窃据中国在联合国的席位的时候，尼赫鲁说，对于中国在联合国组织中的代表权这件事，有人提出了“谁是中国”的问题。中国就在这里，如果谁对这件事有任何疑问，那末他可以看看地图，使自己相信这一点。有人竟看不到这样大的国家，这的确是件奇怪的事。他们的困难在于，他们认为中国在小小的台湾岛上。“这是错误的看法。当一个东西的基础不对头的时候，建筑在上面的上层建筑怎么能够妥当呢。除了那些自认为很聪明的人以外，这对一切人是很基本的问题。”
    尼赫鲁说，这些“聪明绝顶的人”看来也不了解印度的外交政策。所以这样，也许有一个原因是：那是明确的政策，直率的政策，中间没有隐藏任何东西。因此，这种政策不仅给印度带来了很多好处，而且也给世界其他一些地区带来好处，对世界和平也有裨益。“我们不愿意运用我们的一些敏锐的智力来欺骗别人，或者使他们栽筋斗。我们的政策不像某些国家的政策，它们好像是把世界当作棋盘来进行活动的。正是这些棋赛的大师们把世界拖入招致极大灾难的两次世界大战。但是他们仍想要我们接受他们的活动。我们不了解国际棋赛的这个把戏。我们要使我们的政策明确清楚，让全世界都看得到，它的后面是没有隐蔽的动机的。”
    尼赫鲁警告西方国家说，它们可以决定“亚洲命运”的时代早已过去了。他说，亚洲国家除了少数国家之外，都已经获得独立，现在要由亚洲人民来决定他们的命运了。
    尼赫鲁说，西方国家某些人的“旧脑筋”和“这些旧思想”是要对世界的许多纠纷负责的。正是由于这个原因，这些人不了解“亚洲的精神”，并且不了解最近时期在亚洲各国人民的思想中发生了什么变化。
    他接着说，在印度支那，无益的战争进行了七八年之久。进行那个战争是一种罪恶。不久以前，人们采取了若干决定以停止这种冲突，并且给那个地区带来了和平。这些决定本来也可以在七年之前采取的。
    尼赫鲁说，如果各国遵守以“潘查希拉”（按即五项原则）为基础的“国际道义法典”，世界问题将可以大大减少。
    在提到西方国家对于印度同中国之间以及印度同苏联之间日益增长的友谊的反应的时候，尼赫鲁说，这种友谊正在被解释为印度方面对那些西方国家的敌对。采取这种态度是非常令人惊奇的。尼赫鲁说，“中国是我们的朋友。印度和中国都是大国，这两个国家遵循它们各自的道路去达到独立的目标。我们互相尊重。我们时刻愿意互相学习，我们希望在我们之间发展最密切的关系，这并不是说我们开始互相模仿，但是我们当然希望在友好的基础上互相学习。我们还希望在不干涉彼此内政的情况下争取彼此的敬爱和好感。但是，这并不是说由于我们更加接近了，我们就将变成某些其他国家的敌人。为什么某些人要把这种友谊解释为对他们的敌视呢。我们不愿意敌视任何人。我相信，我们并没有敌视任何人，也不会让这种对任何人的敌视情况产生。”
    尼赫鲁提到苏联领袖们对印度的访问，他说，苏联领袖们在印度受到了盛大的欢迎。他们受到了作为贵宾的礼遇，他们的访问同他对苏联的访问一样，有助于使印度和苏联之间的关系更密切。两国将在经济和文化方面彼此帮助，并且两国将同享其利。“在这件事情上，谈不到对任何人产生敌视。有些国家认为，由于欢迎苏联领袖，印度已经疏远了它们而同别人建立了联系。这是完全错误的看法。它们的意思也许是说，如果我们要它们的友谊，那我们就应该成为其他人的敌人。这如何可能呢，因为我们不是任何人的敌人。我们希望获得所有国家的友谊。”尼赫鲁最后说，印度已经决意要同它伟大的邻邦中国建立最密切的关系。（欢呼声）
