Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, December 15th: According to TASS, Kabul, December 15th: Afghan King Mohammed Zahir Shah received Bulganin and Khrushchev on the 15th. During the meeting with the Afghan King, Bulganin presented him with a letter from K.Y. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Present at the reception on the Soviet side were Gromyko, Kumykin, and the Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan, Degtyar. Present on the Afghan side were the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Royal Court, and other officials.

On the same day, Bulganin and Khrushchev paid a visit to Afghan Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan and had talks with him.

Bulganin and Khrushchev also laid a wreath at the tomb of Mohammed Nadir Shah, the father of the Afghan King, who was assassinated in 1933. In 1929, when the reactionary Bascha-i-Saqqao uprising broke out in Afghanistan, Nadir Shah led the tribes of southern Afghanistan to defeat Bascha-i-Saqqao and occupied Kabul. At the assembly of tribal leaders he convened (a meeting of tribal leaders and chieftains), he was declared King of Afghanistan for his merits to the country.

That evening, Afghan King Mohammed Zahir Shah held a reception at the Royal Palace to entertain Bulganin and Khrushchev. Attending the reception were Afghan government officials headed by Mohammed Daoud Khan, National Assembly Speaker Mohammed Nurusai, Senate Speaker Fazel Ahmed Muzdadadi, Afghan Ambassador to the Soviet Union Ghulam Yahya Tarzi, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Afghanistan. Attending on the Soviet side were the personnel accompanying Bulganin and Khrushchev on their visit to Afghanistan.

December 15th became a grand festival in Kabul. To welcome Bulganin and Khrushchev, the entire city was declared a holiday on this day. When the Soviet guests arrived, almost all the residents of Kabul came to the streets to welcome them. Soviet and Afghan flags fluttered everywhere. Everywhere there were welcome slogans written in Russian, Pashto, and Persian, which read: "Our doors and hearts are always open to friends!" "Warm welcome to the distinguished guests!" "Welcome!" "Delighted to see the leaders of our friendly neighbor!" "Soviet Russia and Afghanistan have been and are good neighbors!" Tens of thousands of Kabul residents gathered along the seven-kilometer road from the airport to the guests' residence to warmly and cordially welcome the guests.

    新华社十六日讯  据塔斯社喀布尔十五日讯：阿富汗国王穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿十五日接见了布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。布尔加宁在同阿富汗国王会谈的时候，把苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克·叶·伏罗希洛夫的信件递交给他。接见时，苏联方面在座的有：葛罗米柯、库米金和苏联驻阿富汗大使杰格佳尔，阿富汗方面在座的有首相、副首相、宫廷大臣和其他官员。
    同一天，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫拜会了阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德汗，并且和他谈了话。
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫还向阿富汗国王的父亲、一九三三年被刺的穆罕默德·纳迪尔王的陵墓献花圈。一九二九年当阿富汗国内爆发巴查—萨高的反动暴动时，纳迪尔王率领了阿富汗南部各部落击溃了巴查—萨高，并且占领了喀布尔。在他所召集的部落领袖大会上（各部落首领和头人会议），他因为对祖国的功绩而被宣布为阿富汗国王。
    这一天晚上，阿富汗国王穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿在王宫里举行招待会，招待布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。出席招待会的有以穆罕默德·达乌德汗为首的阿富汗政府负责官员，国民议会议长穆罕默德·努鲁塞、参议院议长法兹尔·艾哈迈德·穆扎达迪、阿富汗驻苏联大使吴拉姆·叶哈雅·塔齐以及各国驻阿富汗外交使节。苏联方面出席的有陪同布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫前来阿富汗访问的人员。
    十二月十五日在喀布尔成了一个盛大的节日。为了欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫，全城在这一天宣布休假。当苏联贵宾到达的时候，喀布尔全城的居民几乎都到街上来欢迎客人。街上到处飘扬着苏联和阿富汗的国旗。到处都是用俄文和普什图文、法西文写的欢迎标语，标语上面写着：“我们的大门和心永远对朋友们敞开！”“热诚欢迎贵宾！”“欢迎！”“很高兴见到我们友好邻邦的领导人！”“苏维埃俄罗斯和阿富汗过去和现在都是好邻邦！”有几万名喀布尔居民聚集在从飞机场到客人们的住所这段七公里长的道路两旁热烈和亲切地欢迎客人。
