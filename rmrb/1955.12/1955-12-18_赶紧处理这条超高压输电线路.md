    Expedite the Handling of this Ultra-High Voltage Transmission Line
    To the Editor:
    There is an ultra-high voltage transmission line, tens of kilometers long, within the jurisdiction of the Mudanjiang Electric Power Bureau. Since the mine in the power receiving area ceased operations, it has been listed as an "idle equipment project." After this, the maintenance task of this transmission line was nominally concurrently managed by the Mudanjiang Electric Power Bureau's line maintenance area, but in reality, the local electric power bureau could not manage it. Over time, some of the angle iron and H-shaped poles on this line have become too old to support the weight, and they have gradually fallen over in the desolate mountains and fields.
    In the autumn of 1953, the Mudanjiang Electric Power Bureau submitted a request to the Northeast Electric Power Administration for instructions on how to dispose of this transmission line. More than a year has passed, and no instructions have been received. Therefore, on October 7, 1954, they wrote another report, and also copied it to the General Bureau of Electric Power Management. The result was still like a stone sinking into the sea, with no news.
    At the end of 1954, the Mudanjiang Electric Power Bureau had an extremely heavy maintenance task and really did not have the strength to take care of this idle ultra-high voltage transmission line. In order to urge the higher authorities to make a decision on its disposal as soon as possible, they compiled detailed statistics on the fallen poles and dropped wires on this line and reported them as urgent documents to the Northeast Electric Power Administration and the General Bureau of Electric Power Management. Later, the production dispatcher used a long-distance telephone to request instructions from the Northeast Electric Power Administration. The Northeast Electric Power Administration then gave an instruction, saying that the handling of this transmission line issue "has been reported to the General Bureau for instructions in accordance with the provisions of the 'Provisional Regulations on Technical Management of the Electric Power Industry.' In addition to urging for instructions, the line should still be strengthened and kept under protection to avoid losses until approval is received."
    Now, more than ten months have passed since the issuance of this instruction. During this period, the Mudanjiang Electric Power Bureau has reported and requested instructions twice more, but the result is still that no one pays attention.
    The value of this transmission line is estimated to be at least four million yuan, which is a huge amount of state property. Why do the leading departments of the electric power industry not pay attention to it?

### 赶紧处理这条超高压输电线路

    赶紧处理这条超高压输电线路编辑同志：
    牡丹江电业局管内有一条长达几十公里的超高压输电线路，自从受电地区的矿山停止开采以后，就被列入了“闲置设备项目”。在这以后，这条输电线路的维护任务，名义上是由牡丹江电业局保线区兼管的，但是实际上基层电业局是管不起来的。日子一久，这条线路上的一些四角柱、H柱老朽得支持不住了，慢慢地躺倒在荒山漫野中。
    一九五三年秋季，牡丹江电业局就把应该怎样处置这条输电线路的问题提请东北电业管理局批示。已经一年多了，还没有看到批示下来。所以，在一九五四年十月七日，他们又写了一个报告，并且同时抄致电业管理总局。结果依然是石沉大海，音信渺茫。
    一九五四年年底，牡丹江电业局检修任务异常繁重，实在没有力量来兼顾这条闲置的超高压输电线路。为了促请上级早日作出处理决定，他们就把这条线路倒杆、掉线的详细情况作出统计后用急件报告东北电业管理局和电业管理总局，后来又由生产调度员用长途电话请示东北电业管理局。东北电业管理局这才给了一道指示，说是这条输电线路的处理问题，“根据‘电力工业技术管理暂行法规’的规定，已报请总局批示，除催请指示外，在未接到批准以前，仍应加强保管，以免损失”。
    现在，距离发这个指示的时间又已经十个多月了。这期间，牡丹江电业局又两度报告请示，结果同样是没有人理睬。
    这条输电线路的价值估计最低也要四百万元，这是国家一笔巨大的财产，为什么电力工业领导部门这样不加重视呢？
