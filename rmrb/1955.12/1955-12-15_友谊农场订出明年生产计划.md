    Friendship Farm, a state-owned farm, has formulated its production plan for 1956, the first year of large-scale production after land reclamation. According to this plan, the planting area of the Friendship Farm will reach 25,000 hectares next year, with an estimated grain harvest of 33,000 tons.

    Of the total grain harvest of the state-owned Friendship Farm next year, after setting aside seeds, food rations, and livestock feed, 25,000 tons of grain will be turned over to the state, yielding a profit of one million yuan.

    In addition to sowing on the wasteland reclaimed this year, the state-owned Friendship Farm plans to sow soybeans and wheat on the 1,200 hectares of wasteland to be reclaimed next year. Timely sowing on newly reclaimed land is an experience gained by the Friendship Farm this year.

    The production plan of the state-owned Friendship Farm for next year also stipulates plans for raising pigs, chickens, draft horses, draft cattle, and dairy cows, including a plan to raise 2,280 hogs. To ensure the realization of the plan, various technical measures are specified in detail. Currently, the workers are carrying out production preparations for next year according to the plan.

    友谊农场订出明年生产计划
    明年是国营友谊农场在开荒后大规模生产的第一年。这个农场已经编制好一九五六年的生产计划。按照这个计划，国营友谊农场明年播种面积将达两万五千公顷，预计收获的谷物是三万三千吨。
    国营友谊农场明年在谷物总收获量中留下种子、食粮和牲畜饲料外，上缴给国家的谷物是两万五千吨，上缴的利润达一百万元。
    国营友谊农场明年除在今年开垦出来的荒地上播种以外，计划在明年开垦的一千二百公顷荒地上播种大豆和小麦。在新垦出的土地上及时播种是国营友谊农场今年所取得的经验。
    国营友谊农场明年的生产计划中还规定了猪、鸡、役马、役牛和乳牛的饲养计划，其中计划养毛猪二千二百八十头。为了保证计划的实现，计划里还详细地规定了各种技术措施。现在，职工们正按着计划进行明年的生产准备工作。（据新华社讯）
