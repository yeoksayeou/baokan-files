Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 27th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on December 27th: Foreign news reports state that the Lao Kingdom authorities held a unilateral election on December 25th, without the participation of the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel.

　　Out of a total of two million Laotians, only 250,000 had the right to vote; women and monks were not allowed to vote. In Vientiane, the capital of Laos, only 11,500 out of 30,000 people eligible to vote actually cast their ballots.

　　According to the report, voters in many provinces, especially Savannakhet and Khammouane, refused to vote. On election day, they left their hometowns, crossed the Mekong River, and fled to Thailand. The Lao Kingdom authorities ordered the border to be closed all day and deployed troops to patrol the river in an attempt to intercept those fleeing the election.

　　According to a report from Laos, prior to election day, a candidate in Saravane Province was arrested on the spot by the Kingdom authorities while campaigning.

　　In a broadcast on the 26th, the BBC, in discussing this unilateral election, reiterated the views of the Lao Fighting Units: that this unilateral election held by the Lao Kingdom authorities is a complete violation of the Geneva Accords.

    老挝王国当局举行片面选举
    据新华社河内二十七日电　据越南通讯社二十七日讯：据外国消息说，老挝王国当局十二月二十五日举行了没有寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员参加的片面选举。
    在总共两百万老挝人中，只有二十五万人有选举权；妇女和僧人没有投票权。在老挝首都万象，准许投票的三万人中只有一万一千五百人投了票。
    据这项消息说，许多省的选民，特别是沙湾拿吉省和坎蒙省的选民拒绝投票。在选举日那天，他们离开了他们的本乡，跨过湄公河，躲到泰国去。老挝王国当局曾下令整天封锁边境的出口，并且出动军队沿河巡逻，企图截住躲开选举的人。
    据老挝来的一项消息说，在选举日以前，沙拉湾省有一位候选人在竞选的时候当场被王国当局逮捕了。
    英国广播公司在二十六日的广播中谈到这次片面选举时追述了寮国战斗部队的意见：老挝王国当局举行的这种片面选举是完全违反日内瓦协定的。
