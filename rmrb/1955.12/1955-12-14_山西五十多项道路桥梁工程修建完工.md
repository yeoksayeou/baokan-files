Over Fifty Road and Bridge Projects in Shanxi Completed

    Shanxi Province has completed more than fifty mountain highway, cart road, and bridge projects this year.

    These projects are distributed in mountainous areas with extremely inconvenient transportation within the province and on highway main lines connecting urban and rural areas. Among the highway and bridge projects, there is the Zhaidongfang stone bridge on the Taiyuan-Jundu highway main line connecting Shanxi and Shaanxi; and the Xiahe large wooden bridge on the Taiyuan-Jincheng highway, which is more than 290 meters long and connects the Jinzhong and Jindongnan mountain areas. The newly built Sanggan River large wooden bridge, which is 414 meters long and spans the Datong-Hunyuan highway, not only solves the problem of material exchange in the Yanbei mountain area, but also plays a significant role in connecting highway transportation in Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia. In addition, the Linfen-Fushan, Linfen-Anze, and Changzhi-Lingchuan highways, which run through the rural areas of southern Shanxi, have also been completed after renovation. The completion of these projects has greatly strengthened highway transportation and expanded the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

    This year, the construction of cart roads and mule tracks in Shanxi Province has also paid special attention to the mountainous rural areas. Those remote mountain areas and high ridges, where there were previously no roads or only narrow paths, are the focus of this year's road construction. Twenty-six cart roads and mule tracks have been built and renovated this year. In addition, nineteen bridge and culvert projects for cart roads and thirty-two highway maintenance projects of medium repair or above have also been completed.

    In carrying out the above projects, the principles of economy and suitability, and relying on the people and using local materials, have been implemented, reducing a large number of project costs. Highway bridges such as Xiahe and Zhaidong, and highways such as Yanbei and Yanhui, alone saved more than 320,000 yuan in project costs. In addition, the newly built Sanggan River large wooden bridge, due to the adoption of Soviet standard drawings and new anti-corrosion methods, shortened the bridge length by 36 meters compared with the original design, and with other savings, reduced the project cost by more than 110,000 yuan, and completed the bridge construction task 56 days ahead of schedule. In the construction of cart roads and highway maintenance projects, unnecessary project items were also reduced, saving project costs for the state.

    山西五十多项道路桥梁工程修建完工
    山西省今年已经有五十多项山区公路、大车路和桥梁工程修建完工。
    这些工程都分布在省内交通极为不便的山区和连结城乡的公路干线上。其中公路和桥梁工程，有沟通陕西和山西交通的太原至军渡公路干线上的寨东方石桥；有全长二百九十余公尺贯连晋中和晋东南山区的太原至晋城公路上的潇河大木桥。新建的全长四百一十四公尺横跨在大同至浑源公路上的桑干河大木桥，不仅解决了雁北山区物资交流的问题，而且对沟通河北、山西、内蒙古三地的公路交通也起了很大作用。此外，经过整修竣工的还有横贯晋南农村的临汾至浮山、临汾至安泽以及晋东南的长治至陵川等三条公路。这些工程的竣工，大大加强了公路运输，扩大了城乡物资交流。
    今年山西省大车路、驮骡路的建设也特别照顾了山区农村，那些偏僻的山野高岭，历来无路或只有羊肠小道的农村，是今年道路建设的重点。今年修建、整修竣工的大车路、驮骡路就有二十六条。此外，尚有十九项大车路的桥涵工程和三十二项中修以上的公路养护维修工程也已竣工。
    在进行上述工程中，贯彻执行了经济适用的原则和依靠民力，就地取材的方针，降低了大批的工程造价。仅潇河、寨东等公路桥梁和雁北、岩会等公路即节约工程造价三十二万多元。此外，新建桑干河大木桥，由于采用了苏联标准图和新的防腐方法，桥长较原设计缩短了三十六公尺，加以其他节约，共降低工程造价十一万余元，并且提前五十六天完成建桥任务。大车路工程及公路养护工程方面，也经过削减不必要的工程项目，节约工程造价，为国家节省了工程费用。
