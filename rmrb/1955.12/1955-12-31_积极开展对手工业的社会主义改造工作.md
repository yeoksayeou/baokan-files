Actively Carry Out the Socialist Transformation of Handicraft Industry

Handicraft industry is an indispensable economic force in China's national economy. Even when China's large-scale industry has greatly developed in the future, handicraft industry will still be a powerful assistant to state-owned industry. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the handicraft cooperative movement has developed considerably. By the end of 1955, it is estimated that there will be more than 70,000 handicraft production cooperatives (groups) nationwide, with 2 million members (including more than 20,000 production cooperatives with 856,000 members), accounting for 25.47 percent of the 7.85 million people who are the main targets of the current handicraft sector's transformation (of which production cooperatives account for 42.8 percent of the number of people organized), and the output value accounts for 27.06 percent of the total handicraft output value (excluding farmers' sideline production) (of which the output value of production cooperatives accounts for 63.3 percent of the organized output value). More than 80 percent of the grassroots production cooperatives (groups) that have already been organized are consolidated, and some production cooperatives have even carried out preliminary technological transformations and have become modern cooperative factories. This is the banner of the current handicraft cooperative movement. These situations show that the work in recent years has laid the foundation for further carrying out the socialist transformation of handicraft industry.

However, judging from the development speed of handicraft cooperation, it is far from meeting the requirements of national industrialization and agricultural cooperation. Since 1955, there have been many applications for organizing production cooperatives (groups), but very few have been approved. This serious situation of leadership lagging behind the masses must be reversed immediately.

After discussion, the National Handicraft Production Cooperative Conference drafted a plan to basically complete the organizational task of handicraft cooperation within two years, 1956 and 1957, so as to strive to transition all semi-socialist production cooperatives (groups) to completely socialist production cooperatives in the next few years, and gradually carry out technological transformation of handicrafts. What are the conditions for completing this task? The development of national industry, especially large-scale industry, can provide a large amount of technical equipment to handicraft industry in advance (especially old machines replaced by large-scale industry); the high tide of agricultural cooperation has brought favorable conditions for raw material supply and a broad market for product sales to handicraft industry; the increasing planning of the national economy and the shrinking of the free market have forced handicraft production to be quickly incorporated into the national plan; the enthusiasm of handicraft laborers to take the road of cooperation is generally high, and there are about 3 million spontaneous organizations and processing and ordering groups of the commercial sector nationwide. As long as they undergo certain education and rectification, they can be built into formal production cooperatives (groups). The handicraft cooperative movement in recent years, especially the old cooperatives that have been vigorously rectified and consolidated this year, has demonstrated the superiority of cooperation. All these have created conditions for future great development.

Of course, facing such an arduous political task, it is impossible to imagine that there are no difficulties. For example, about two-thirds of the counties and cities in the country have not yet established handicraft leadership organizations, and those that have been established are also very unsound. The right-leaning conservative ideas of cadres still need to be further overcome, a large number of backbone cadres for establishing cooperatives need to be further trained, and the imbalance between supply, production and sales cannot be completely resolved all at once. The quality of products is still unstable or not high, the variety is insufficient, there are still many problems in management, and the improvement of technology cannot keep up with the needs, etc. However, these difficulties are difficulties in the course of progress, and they are completely surmountable. Handicraft work cadres should criticize and overcome right-leaning conservative ideas, take active measures to solve the difficulties of imbalance between supply, production and sales, and avoid and eliminate the phenomenon of separation between arrangement and transformation, consolidation and development. Facts have proved that only by more rapidly organizing scattered, individual handicraft workers and gradually incorporating them into the national plan on the basis of supply-production-sales balance can they be effectively helped to overcome the difficulties in business operations.

All localities should quickly formulate comprehensive plans for handicraft cooperation in the whole province (city), the whole special district (city), the whole county (city), the whole district (centered on market towns) and the whole township. The planning time should be completed at the same time as the comprehensive planning for agricultural cooperation and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. The requirement of the plan should be positive and reliable. The basis of the plan is the industry plan. The content of the plan, in addition to the speed indicators of cooperation and mechanization, should also include the scale of cooperative construction, cadre training, the variety and quantity of products, raw material sources, product sales, finance, capital construction, and cultural and welfare facilities. The planning method is to combine leadership and the masses, strengthen investigation and research, closely contact relevant departments, especially strengthen contact with state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, and repeatedly discuss and study from top to bottom and from bottom to top, from rough to fine, and gradually become perfect. Grassroots cooperatives (groups) should also formulate their own plans, mainly organizational development plans and production plans. The method of establishing cooperatives should adopt the method of transforming the entire industry and in stages, batches, and areas. In the process of establishing cooperatives, it should be combined with investigation, arrangement, development, and rectification, so that arrangement and transformation, development and consolidation are closely combined, and technical transformation is carried out accordingly. In terms of development steps, the focus should be on towns and concentrated production areas, or organized by industry and industry, or transformed in batches according to industries with similar properties and cooperative relationships. According to the degree of awareness and requirements of the masses, some can be transformed at one time, and some can be carried out in batches. Not only should poor and more conscious handicraft laborers be absorbed into the cooperatives as soon as possible, but also the more affluent handicraft laborers should be educated and organized as soon as possible under the principle of voluntariness. Those who have the conditions to directly organize production cooperatives may not go through low-level forms; supply and marketing production cooperatives (groups) should make appropriate arrangements for the auxiliary labor force of "connected shops" and actively create transition conditions. It is wrong to stay in low-level forms for a long time without transition.

The work of rapidly establishing and improving handicraft leadership organizations and vigorously training cadres must also be grasped. All regions that have not established handicraft management institutions and production federations should create conditions to establish them as soon as possible; regions where the institutions are not yet sound should quickly transfer cadres to enrich the institutions. In order to meet the requirements of transformation by industry, the central and provincial (municipal) federations should add corresponding professional management departments according to work needs. The federations of large and medium-sized cities and concentrated handicraft production areas should establish professional federations according to the needs and possibilities, or establish comprehensive professional federations according to several similar industries. The cadres needed by federations at all levels, especially the leading backbone, should be quickly transferred and enriched. In addition to allocating the necessary number of leading backbone, the cadres needed by grassroots cooperatives (groups) in the process of establishing cooperatives should mainly be selected from activists of existing grassroots cooperatives (groups), handicraft laborers' associations, spontaneous organizations, and processing and ordering groups, and absorb some demobilized soldiers and primary and secondary school graduates, and adopt short-term training methods to train a large number of backbone cadres for establishing cooperatives and professional cadres such as accounting and planning statistics.

The direction of handicraft production is to face the countryside, serve agricultural production, and serve the needs of urban and rural people's lives and exports. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the variety of products, improve the specifications and styles according to the development and changes of social needs, and especially pay attention to the production of production and living materials needed by farmers. After being organized, the quality of products should only be improved, not reduced, and the variety of products should only be increased, not reduced. At the same time, in order to meet the development requirements of agricultural cooperation, counties, districts, and townships should earnestly pay attention to the manufacturing and repair business of new and old farm tools, and quickly establish fixed repair stations and mobile repair teams centered on market towns.

We should earnestly implement the spirit of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily," develop production, practice thrift, improve product quality, reduce product costs, and educate members to cherish the property of the cooperative, reduce all unnecessary expenses, and through the accumulation of own funds, start from simple improvements of tools and equipment modifications, and gradually realize the semi-mechanization and even complete mechanization of handicraft production, and continuously improve labor productivity, and correspondingly improve the material and cultural life of members on the basis of developing production.

Party committees and governments at all levels should earnestly strengthen the leadership of the handicraft cooperative movement and solve various difficulties in the process of cooperation in a timely manner. We should earnestly incorporate various plans of the handicraft sector, first of all the supply-production-sales plan, into the local industrial plan. It can be believed that as long as we unite and rely on the vast number of handicraft laborers, give full play to the enthusiasm of handicraft workers, make comprehensive plans, and overcome backward ideas, the task of socialist transformation of handicraft industry will surely be successfully completed.

### 积极开展对手工业的社会主义改造工作

    积极开展对手工业的社会主义改造工作
    手工业在我国国民经济中是一支不可缺少的经济力量，在将来我国大工业有了巨大发展的时候，手工业仍将是国营工业的有力助手。几年来，在党和政府的正确领导下，手工业合作化运动有了相当发展。在一九五五年底，预计全国将有手工业生产合作社（组）七万多个，社（组）员二百万人（其中生产合作社二万多个，社员八十五万六千多人），占目前手工业部门主要改造对象七百八十五万人的百分之二十五点四七
  （其中生产社占组织起来人数的百分之四十二点八），产值占手工业总产值（不包括农民兼营部分）的百分之二十七点零六（其中生产社产值占组织起来产值的百分之六十三点三）。现在已经组织起来的基层生产合作社（组），百分之八十以上是巩固的，其中有的生产合作社并且已经进行了初步的技术改造，实际上成了现代化的合作工厂，这是当前手工业合作化运动的旗帜。这些情况说明，几年来的工作，已为进一步开展对手工业的社会主义改造工作奠定了基础。
    但是从手工业合作化的发展速度来看，还远远不能适应国家工业化和农业合作化的要求。一九五五年以来申请组织生产合作社（组）的仍然很多，但批准的仍然很少。这种领导落后于群众的严重情况，必须立即扭转。
    这次全国手工业生产合作会议经过讨论，拟定在一九五六和一九五七年两年以内，基本上完成手工业合作化的组织任务，从而在今后几年内争取把全部半社会主义性质的生产合作社（组）过渡到完全社会主义性质的生产合作社，并且逐步进行对手工业的技术改造。完成这一任务的条件是什么呢？国家工业的发展，特别是大工业可以提前供给手工业以大量技术装备（特别是大工业替换下来的旧机器）；农业合作化的高潮，为手工业带来了原料供应的有利条件和产品销售的广阔市场；国民经济计划性的日益增强，自由市场缩小了，促使手工业生产不得不迅速纳入国家计划轨道；手工业劳动者要求走合作化道路的情绪普遍高涨，全国现有手工业的自发组织和商业部门的加工订货小组等约三百万人，只要经过一定的教育和整顿，就可以分别建成正式的生产合作社（组）。几年来的手工业合作化运动，特别是今年大力进行了整顿和巩固工作的老社，已经显示了合作化的优越性。这些都给今后大发展创造了条件。
    当然，面对着这样一个繁重的政治任务，不能设想是没有困难的。例如全国还有三分之二左右的县、市还没有建立起手工业的领导机构，已经建立的也很不健全，干部中的右倾保守思想还有待于进一步克服，大批建社骨干有待于进一步培养，供产销不平衡情况也不能一下子就全部解决，产品的质量还不稳定或者不高，品种也不足，管理上还存在着不少问题，技术的提高还赶不上需要等等。但这些困难是前进中的困难，是完全可以克服的困难。手工业工作干部应该批判和克服右倾保守思想，采取积极的措施，解决供产销不平衡的困难，避免和消除安排和改造、巩固和发展互相脱节的现象。事实证明，只有更迅速地把分散的、一家一户的个体手工业者组织起来，在供产销平衡的基础上逐步纳入国家计划的轨道，才能有效地帮助他们克服业务经营上的困难。
    各地应该迅速订出全省（市）、全专区（市）、全县（市）、全区（以集镇为中心）和全乡的手工业合作化的全面规划。规划的时间应该同农业合作化和资本主义工商业改造的全面规划同时完成。规划的要求应该是积极可靠的。规划的基础是行业规划。规划的内容，除必须有合作化和机械化的速度指标以外，还应该包括建社规模、干部培养、产品的品种和数量、原料来源、产品销售、财务、基本建设以及文化福利设施等方面。规划的方法，是领导和群众相结合，加强调查研究，密切和有关部门联系，特别是加强同国营商业、供销合作社的联系，由上而下和由下而上地反复讨论研究，由粗到细，逐步趋于完备。基层合作社（组）也要订出自己的规划，主要是组织发展规划和生产规划。建社方法要采取全行业改造和分期、分批、分片的方法。在建社过程中，应该是边调查、边安排、边发展、边整顿，作到安排和改造、发展和巩固密切结合，并相应地进行技术改造。在发展步骤上，应该以城镇和集中产区为重点，或者逐行、逐业地组织，或者按性质相近、有协作关系的行业成批地进行改造。根据群众的觉悟程度和要求，有的可以一次改造完，也有的可以分批进行。不仅要尽先吸收贫苦的和觉悟程度较高的手工业劳动者入社，而且对较富裕的手工业劳动者，亦应该加紧教育，在自愿原则下，尽早地把他们组织起来。凡有条件直接组织生产合作社的，可以不经过低级形式；供销生产社（组）要对“连家铺”的辅助劳动力作出适当安排，积极创造过渡条件。长期停留在低级形式而不进行过渡是错误的。
    迅速建立和健全手工业领导机构，大力培养和训练干部的工作也必须抓紧进行。凡是没有建立手工业管理机构和生产联社的地区，应该创造条件尽快建立起来；机构还不健全的地区，应该迅速调配干部，充实机构。为了适应按行业改造的要求，中央和省（市）级联社应根据工作需要，增设相应的专业管理部门。大中城市和手工业集中产区的联社应按照需要和可能，按行业建立专业联社，或按几个相近的行业建立带综合性的专业联社。各级联社所需要的干部，特别是领导骨干，应该迅速进行调配和充实。基层合作社（组）在建社过程中所需要的干部，除应调配必要数量的领导骨干以外，主要的应该从现有基层合作社（组）、手工业者劳动协会、自发组织、加工订货小组的积极分子当中加以选拔，并且吸收一部分复员军人和中小学毕业生，采取短期训练的办法，大批培养建社骨干以及会计、计划统计等专业干部。
    手工业生产的方向，是面向农村，为农业生产服务，并且为城乡人民生活需要和出口服务。因此，应当根据社会需要的发展和变化，增加产品品种，改进规格式样，特别是注意农民所需要的生产、生活资料的生产。组织起来以后，产品质量只应提高，不许降低，品种只应增加，不许减少。同时，为了适应农业合作化的发展要求，县、区、乡应切实注意新旧农具的制造和修配业务，并且以集镇为中心，迅速建立固定的修配站和流动的修配小组。
    应该切实贯彻“勤俭办社”的精神，发展生产，厉行节约，提高产品质量，降低产品成本，并且教育社员爱护合作社的财产，减少一切非必要的开支，通过自有资金的积累，从简单的改进工具、改装设备入手，逐步实现手工业的半机械化以至完全的机械化生产，不断地提高劳动生产率，在发展生产的基础上相应地改善社员的物质文化生活。
    各级党委、政府应该切实加强对手工业合作化运动的领导，及时解决合作化过程中的各种困难。应该切实地把手工业部门的各种计划，首先是供产销计划，逐步纳入地方工业的计划之内。可以相信，只要团结和依靠广大的手工业劳动者，充分发挥手工业工作者的积极性，做好全面规划，克服落后思想，对手工业实行社会主义改造的任务，就一定能够胜利完成。
