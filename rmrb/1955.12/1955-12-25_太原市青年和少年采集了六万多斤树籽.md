    Taiyuan Youth and Children Collected Over 60,000 Jin of Tree Seeds
    After the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Taiyuan Municipal Youth Federation jointly issued a call to the city's youth and children to collect 20,000 jin of tree seeds, the city's youth from all walks of life responded enthusiastically, influencing and driving some adults and elderly people to participate. As of December 10th, more than 400 units and approximately 100,000 young people and children across the city had collected a total of 64,033 jin of tree seeds.
    This tree seed collection activity had the largest number of participants in mass activities of youth and children in Taiyuan in recent years. In the tree seed collection activity, a group of advanced youth and children's collectives and activists emerged. Comrades from the Shanxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army collected 5,570 jin of tree seeds, the most of any unit in the city. More than 27,000 elementary school children across the city collected more than 22,500 jin of tree seeds. The 481 elementary students of Jinci Elementary School collected 1,987 jin.

Among them, the eleven young people of the Friendship Self-Study Group collected a total of 570 jin, averaging 51 jin and 13 liang per person, the highest average collection per person in the city.
    On December 11th, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League convened the Taiyuan Municipal Youth and Children's Conference to Dedicate Tree Seeds to the Motherland. At the meeting, Li Dechang, Deputy Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, on behalf of the Municipal Committee of the League and the Municipal Youth Federation, called on the city's youth and children to do three things well in 1956: First, to complete the glorious task of collecting 100,000 jin of tree seeds; Second, to strive to complete 100 mu of youth nurseries; Third, each young person should plant ten trees in the spring and autumn of next year, and each child should plant one tree, ensuring a survival rate of more than 90%, and striving to complete approximately 50% of the city's task of planting 4.4 million trees next year.
