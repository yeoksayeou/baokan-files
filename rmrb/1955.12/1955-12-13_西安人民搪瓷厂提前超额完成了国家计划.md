    Xi'an People's Enamel Factory Pretermly Overfulfilled the National Plan
    By Our Correspondent Li Qian
    Before the first half of this year, the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory failed to meet its plan. The main reason was poor product quality. One reason for the poor quality was the weak technical force. The whole factory didn't have a single engineer, and the technicians were all promoted from workers. More than 90 percent of the workers were young workers and apprentices. What was especially serious was the lack of unified operating procedures, with "each master having his own orders." Another reason for the poor quality was the erroneous thinking of both leaders and employees in emphasizing quantity over quality. The enamel burning workers increased firewood in the furnace to raise the furnace temperature. The temperature of the firewood was uneven, and charcoal dust easily flew into the enamel products, affecting product quality. Although the factory leaders had instructed not to burn firewood, they would take the initiative to propose adding firewood as long as the production plan was not completed for two consecutive days.
    The factory's product variety was also small, only including washbasins, mugs, plates, vegetable basins, small rice bowls, and spittoons. The washbasins and mugs were too large in diameter and expensive, which farmers did not need.
    However, from the third quarter onward, the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory turned into a factory that could complete or overfulfill its plan every month. On December 3rd, the factory comprehensively and overfulfilled its annual plan, with the output value plan exceeding by 10.4 percent, the quality plan exceeding by 8.66 percent, the profit delivery plan exceeding by 9.15 percent, and the output exceeding by 0.3 percent.
    Why were they able to quickly reverse the situation of not completing the plan and fulfill the national plan ahead of schedule? The main reason is that all employees seriously inspected production in the increased production and conservation campaign, and began to improve product quality and expand product varieties and designs in a planned way.
    To improve product quality, the production section chief, technicians from each workshop, and veteran skilled workers organized a quality inspection and research group, and formulated unified operating procedures based on the experience of advanced factories and the specific conditions of their factory. In the pickling process of the first workshop, cold sulfuric acid water was used to wash the billets in the past, which took three to five hours. Sometimes, the workers on the previous shift would put the billets in the vat and go off work before taking them out, and they could not be taken out until the next shift started. The billets were corroded by soaking in sulfuric acid water for too long. Now, according to the successful experience of the Beijing Enamel Technology Research Group in testing acid-resistant enamel, they have changed to using hot sulfuric acid water to wash the billets, which only takes five to twenty minutes to wash a vat of billets. The work efficiency of the pickling process has been greatly improved, and the quality of the billets has also been guaranteed. In the past, they used 1,224 catties of sulfuric acid every day, but with the new method, they only use 280 catties of sulfuric acid every day.
    The workers in the punching group of the first workshop used to produce iron sheets for making billets that were very uneven, with large burrs around them, which greatly affected the quality of the next process. After research, they found that the main reason for the large burrs was that the blanking die was not sharp. The reason why the die was not sharp was that the tool for sharpening the die was not good. It took the workers a long time to sharpen a die, and they were unwilling to sharpen it. After finding the reason, the fitter Ma Zhiqian and the turner Zhang Zongrang in the workshop jointly researched and manufactured a die sharpening tool. Sharpening the die with this tool is fast and labor-saving.
    In the past, the third workshop used spur racks to fire 20 cm ice flower rice bowls. The surface of the fired bowls had marks from the spur racks, which seriously affected the quality. At the same time, only four bowls could be fired each time using spur racks, and the production efficiency was very low. Workers Ma Dongpo and Ma Zixing created a kind of support rack for firing bowls, which can fire eight bowls each time, and the fired bowls have no tool marks.
    Although workers and technicians have made a lot of efforts to improve quality and have achieved certain results, some major technical problems still cannot be solved due to technical limitations. For example, phenomena such as edge bursts, pinholes, pitting, and hairlines on enamel washbasins and mugs have been unavoidable for a long time. To overcome this difficulty, they invited an engineer from the Shanghai Joint State-Private Zhonghua Enamel Factory. All employees actively participated in experience exchange meetings and technical seminars guided by the engineer, and jointly studied how to improve product quality. Many veteran masters and young workers looked for the engineer whenever they were free to learn advanced experience from brother factories. Now, after the efforts of engineers, technicians, and workers, the problems of edge bursts, pinholes, pitting, and hairlines on washbasins and mugs are gone.
    In order to increase the designs and varieties of products to meet the needs of the broad masses of people, they also sent people with more than a dozen different designs and varieties of products to rural areas such as Baoji and Caijiapo and temple fairs near Xi'an to hold exhibitions and consumer seminars. At the exhibitions and seminars, farmers pointed out which products they liked and needed, and which products they didn't like and didn't need. Some farmers said: Girls like to have red washbasins and tea trays with the character "囍" (double happiness) when they get married, but the yellow flower washbasins currently produced by the enamel factory are not good-looking. Some farmers said that some large washbasins and mugs are too expensive to afford, and suggested that the factory produce some small washbasins and small mugs for primary school students. In terms of product quality, farmers pointed out that the porcelain was not glossy and the color was not bright enough. The factory improved production based on these opinions. Since September, they have trial-produced foot warmers, woks, and square and round plates for ethnic minorities, as well as food baskets, milk cans, baby bathtubs, teapots, and sanitary ware. Because these products are produced according to consumers' opinions, they are very popular among the masses.
    The experience of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory shows that as long as the leaders of enterprises conscientiously rely on workers and technicians and listen to consumers' opinions with an open mind, technical problems in production and sales problems of products can be solved, and the situation of not completing the plan can be reversed.

### 西安人民搪瓷厂提前超额完成了国家计划

    西安人民搪瓷厂提前超额完成了国家计划
    本报记者　李茜
    今年上半年以前，西安人民搪瓷厂没有完成计划。主要原因是产品质量不好。质量不好的原因，一个是技术力量薄弱。全厂没有一个工程师，技术员也都是从工人中提拔的，百分之九十以上的工人都是青年工人和徒工。尤其严重的是没有统一的操作规程，“一个师傅一个令”。质量不好的另一个原因是从领导人员到职工都有重产量、轻质量的错误思想。烧搪瓷的工人为了提高炉温，就在炉子里增加木柴。木柴的温度不均匀，而且木炭屑很容易飞到搪瓷制品中去，影响产品质量。工厂领导人员虽然指示过不准烧木柴，但是，只要连续两天没完成产量计划，他们就主动提出加烧木柴。
    这个厂的产品品种也不多，只有面盆、口杯、盘子、菜盆、小饭碗和痰盂等。面盆和口杯的口径过大，价格又高，农民不需要。
    但是，从第三季度起，西安人民搪瓷厂转变成月月都能完成或超额完成计划了。十二月三日，这个厂全面地超额地完成了全年计划，产值计划超额百分之十点四，质量计划超额百分之八点六六，上缴利润计划超额百分之九点一五，产量超额百分之零点三。
    为什么他们能够很快地扭转了完不成计划的情况，并且提前完成了国家计划呢？主要是因为全体职工在增产节约运动中，认真检查生产，并且开始有计划地提高了产品质量和扩大了产品的品种、花色。
    他们为了提高产品质量，由生产科长、各车间的技术员和老技术工人组织成了质量检查研究组，根据先进厂的经验和本厂的具体情况，制定了统一的操作规程。第一车间的酸洗工序，过去都是用冷硫酸水洗坯子，时间要三个到五个钟头。有的时候，上一班工人把坯子放进缸里没等到拿出来就下班，直到下一班工人上班时才能取出来。坯子在硫酸水里泡得时间过长，就被侵蚀了。现在，他们根据北京珐琅技术研究组试验耐酸搪瓷成功的经验，改用热硫酸水洗坯子，只用五分钟到二十分钟就能洗出一缸坯子，酸洗工序的工作效率大大提高，坯子的质量也有了保证。他们过去每天用一千二百二十四斤硫酸，用新办法每天只用二百八十斤硫酸。
    第一车间冲床组的工人，过去生产的作坯子用的铁片很不整齐，周围有很大的毛刺，对下一道工序的质量影响很大。经过研究，他们发现毛刺大的主要原因是落片刀不快。而刀不快的原因是磨刀的工具不好，工人们磨一把刀费很长时间，都不愿去磨。原因找出来以后，车间的钳工马志谦和车工张宗让等就共同研究，制造了一个磨刀工具。用这个工具磨刀又快又省力。
    过去，第三车间用刺架烧二十公分的冰花饭碗，烧成的碗表面有刺架卡的印子，严重地影响质量。同时，使用刺架烧碗每次只能烧四个，生产效率很低。工人马东坡和马子兴创造了一种烧碗的撑架，每次可以烧八个，烧出的碗没有工具印子。
    工人和技术人员在提高质量方面虽然作了不少努力，也取得了一定的成绩，但是因为受技术水平的限制，有些重大的技术问题仍不能解决。如搪瓷面盆、口杯上的爆边、爆点、麻皮和发丝等现象，就是他们长期不能避免的。为了克服这个困难，他们从上海公私合营中华珐琅厂请来一位工程师。全体职工都踊跃参加由这位工程师指导的经验交流会和技术座谈会，共同研究如何提高产品质量。很多老师傅和青年工人们，一有空就找工程师，从他那里学习兄弟厂的先进经验。现在，经过工程师和技术人员、工人的努力，脸盆、口杯上的爆边、爆点、麻皮和发丝等毛病都没有了。
    为了增加产品的花色和品种，以适应广大人民的需要，他们又派人携带十几种不同花色、不同品种的产品，到宝鸡、蔡家坡等地的农村和西安附近的庙会去展览，举行消费者座谈会。在展览会和座谈会上，农民们指出了哪些产品是他们所喜欢和需要的，哪些产品是他们不喜欢和不需要的。有的农民说：姑娘们出嫁喜欢要红色带喜字的面盆和茶盘，搪瓷厂现在生产的黄色花面盆很不好看。有的农民说，现在有些大面盆和口杯价钱太贵，买不起，建议工厂生产一些小面盆和小学生用的小口杯。在产品质量方面，农民们指出了瓷质不光，色泽不够鲜艳。工厂根据这些意见改进了生产。从九月份起，试制了暖脚壶、炒锅和少数民族用的方盘和圆盘，还试制了食篮、牛奶筒、小孩浴盆、茶壶和卫生器皿等。因为这些产品都是根据消费者的意见生产的，所以很受群众欢迎。
    西安人民搪瓷厂的经验说明，只要企业的领导者认真依靠工人和技术人员，虚心倾听消费者的意见，生产的技术问题和产品的销路问题都是可以解决的，完不成计划的局面是可以扭转的。
