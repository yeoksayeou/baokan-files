Khrushchev's Speech at the Reception Held by the Prime Minister of Kashmir on December 10

Dear friends:

First of all, please allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Yuvaraj Karan Singh, the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir State, Mr. Bakshi, the Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir State, all friends present, and all the people of your state for the warm hospitality extended to us. (Prolonged applause)

We will never forget the very warm welcome from the people of Kashmir. When we took a boat trip along the river yesterday, the banks were crowded with people welcoming us. As we walked through the streets of Srinagar, the masses lined the streets to welcome us. The residents of Kashmir, like the residents of other cities and provinces in India we have visited, expressed sincere friendship and love for their friends and brothers—the Soviet people, which deeply moved us. (Applause)

Your state is closest to the Soviet Union's Central Asian republics—Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. (Applause) Therefore, we gratefully accepted the invitation of your State Governor, the respected Yuvaraj Karan Singh, to visit Kashmir. We are very happy to be able to visit your state, because it is the hometown of your Prime Minister—our respected Mr. Nehru. (Prolonged applause)

The climate here is the same as the climate in our Central Asian republics, and many crops are also the same. After we arrived here, it was as if we were breathing in the atmosphere of our motherland, southern Central Asia. The residents of Kashmir and your state capital, Srinagar, are different in terms of their ethnicity. There are Kashmiri, Dogra, and Ladakhi people here, and among the residents of Kashmir, there are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and people of other ethnic groups and other religions. However, as we walked through the streets of Srinagar, we felt that people of all religious beliefs and ethnic groups were unanimously welcoming us. This can be seen from the welcome banners and the greetings from the residents of Srinagar.

All of this is linked to the name of the Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Nehru, who enjoys great prestige and reputation here as he does in other states of India. (Prolonged applause)

All of this shows that the people of Jammu and Kashmir State, including various ethnic groups and various religious beliefs, are getting along friendly and are striving to do very beneficial work for their motherland—the Republic of India. (Applause)

Friendly cooperation between ethnic groups is particularly close and easy to understand for us. Our country is a multi-ethnic country in terms of its ethnic composition. In the Soviet Union, there are people of various religious beliefs. And this has not caused any estrangement between us. The Soviet people live and work together like a harmonious big family. (Applause)

The issue of religious belief is a matter of the heart for every individual and every ethnic group. Our delegation includes Rasulov, Rakhimbabayeva, and Rashidov, representatives from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and the nationalities of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are Islamic.

However, is there any difference between Muslims and people of other religions in our country? In our country, there is no such difference, because all the nationalities of our country are worthy members of the great Soviet Union, and they form the big family of all ethnic groups in our country. (Applause)

In our Soviet Union, the national question and the issue of religious freedom have been completely resolved. Every one of our citizens can participate in religious worship whenever he deems it necessary.

I am talking about this to make our position on this issue clearer to you. Because some countries still try to sow discord among the various ethnic groups in India, incite ethnic hatred, or divide the people of all ethnic groups according to religious beliefs. Official figures in these countries strive to artificially create conflicts.

But does all of this benefit India and the various ethnic groups in India? I believe that this harms the interests of the entire India and the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in India.

The people of all ethnic groups hope to have the opportunity to work, improve their culture, and live a prosperous life. They hope to have a free country that is not at the mercy of imperialist countries.

Does all of this depend on which religion this or that ethnic group believes in? I don’t think so. (Applause)

In order to have political freedom, to have the opportunity to continuously improve one's knowledge, and to have material security, it is not necessary to establish a country with a single religious belief. What is needed is that the people have freedom and that there is no phenomenon of man exploiting man. (Applause)

We have never forced anyone to accept our views and the way we manage the country, and we do not do so now. The people of each country can and must solve for themselves what kind of way to manage the country they should choose and what kind of ideological concepts to adopt. But we want to point out that the path chosen by our people has enabled them to enter the heyday of exerting all their creativity and has provided great possibilities for further developing their national economy and culture to improve the welfare of the broad masses of the people.

Why did the so-called Kashmir issue arise? This problem did not arise among the people. Instead, it was some countries, blinded by greed, that incited hostility among the people of those countries that were freeing themselves from colonial oppression and shaking off the long shackles of foreign oppressors. (Applause)

Monopolists are pursuing their own goals completely. They instigate a part of the people of one country to oppose another part of the people, attempting to make these countries more economically subordinate to them and to make these countries obey their will.

I don't need to point out which countries are constantly exacerbating the Kashmir issue, because this is very clear. And these countries don't hide their interest in further aggravating this issue much.

The Security Council has discussed the Kashmir issue, and the Soviet representative has clearly stated our Soviet Union's views on this issue.

On this issue, our position is extremely clear. The Soviet Union has always believed that the settlement of the issue of Kashmir's political status should be a matter for the people of Kashmir themselves. This is in line with democratic principles and in line with the interests of consolidating friendly relations between the people of all ethnic groups in this region. (Prolonged applause) The Soviet Union adopts a just and objective position on the Kashmir issue and has always expressed deep sympathy for the people of Kashmir and the peace-loving democratic forces of Kashmir. This force has established friendly relations with the progressive and peace-loving forces in the Republic of India, which know the national aspirations of the people of Kashmir very well.

Facts have proved that the residents of Kashmir do not want Kashmir to become a tool in the hands of imperialist forces. (Stormy applause) And some major powers, under the pretext of supporting Pakistan's position on the Kashmir issue, are precisely trying to make Kashmir their tool.

If allowed, I would like to talk generally about my opinion on the division of India into two countries. What pains us—friends of India—is that the imperialist forces actually divided India into two parts—India and Pakistan. It should be known that before the Indian people won their national independence, there was a unified India. The practice of dividing India into two parts is not beneficial to the people of all ethnic groups in India. It is precisely for this purpose that some people have stirred up trouble around the different religious beliefs of the people of all ethnic groups in India, although the issue of religious belief is by no means the main issue in establishing a country.

Our country can be taken as an example. There are currently more than 15 million Muslims in the Soviet Union, as well as other religious believers. Despite different religious beliefs, the people of all ethnic groups in our country live in harmony and friendship. They have established and are constantly strengthening their unified country—the socialist country of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. (Applause)

From this, it can be seen that the different religious beliefs of the residents were not the main factor in the establishment of Pakistan and its separation from the unified Indian state. Other countries, which pursue the principle of "divide and rule!" that everyone has long known in their policies, actively participated in this matter. They used the factor of different religious beliefs to achieve their goals.

We are deeply convinced that when intense emotions disappear and the people realize the full meaning of this artificial division of Indian territory, they will regret it.

But the issue of establishing two independent countries—India and Pakistan—has been resolved. I am frankly stating my opinion on this matter not at all in order to re-examine this issue somewhere. I am saying this as a matter of fact. Since these two countries exist and are developing, then there is no need to re-divide the borders of the two countries, as some countries hope. (Applause) Everyone knows that changing borders is often a painful thing and will definitely cause bloodshed.

The issue of Kashmir as a state of the Republic of India has been resolved by the people of Kashmir themselves. This is a matter for the people themselves. (Stormy and prolonged applause) I believe that both sides need to show great will to maintain peace in this region, because both India and Pakistan can only develop in an environment of peaceful coexistence. (Applause)

We have extremely friendly relations with the Republic of India. (Applause) This relationship has arisen because we have established mutual relations on the five principles of peaceful coexistence that everyone knows. We have many common views on international political issues. We stand on a common position in opposing the establishment of military blocs and various military alliances. The governments of our two countries are implementing policies that help ease international tensions and prevent the outbreak of war.

The independent and autonomous Republic of India is a young country that is growing. What brings us closer to each other is that this country is actively striving for world peace. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic of India, and India does not interfere in our internal affairs. (Applause) The internal affairs of each country are a matter for the people of each country themselves.

If we consider the Republic of India to be our ally in the struggle for peace and for the peaceful resolution of outstanding issues, then it is a pity that we cannot view Pakistan in this way. Pakistan is also a young country. However, the policies implemented by the ruling group of this country are worrying us. Facts have proved that their policies are not based on the vital interests of their own people and their own country, but are dictated by the monopoly capital groups of other countries. The current government of Pakistan openly flaunts its special closeness to the American monopoly capital groups. (Lively atmosphere in the venue) It is one of the first participants and initiators of the notorious Baghdad Pact, which is by no means for the interests of peace. (Lively atmosphere in the venue) It has allowed the establishment of American military bases on its territory, and these bases are tightly close to the Soviet border.

We frankly say that the establishment of American military bases on Pakistani territory cannot but make us feel worried. Now, with the active participation of Pakistan, efforts are being further made to expand the number of member states of the Baghdad Pact.

It is regrettable that the Iranian government has followed the imperialist forces and joined this treaty.

We openly say that we have never supported and will not support the participants of the Baghdad Pact, just as we do not support any bloc against the Soviet Union.

Otherwise, we would be politically blind. Everyone can see very clearly that the spearhead of the Baghdad Pact is aimed at the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. Therefore, our task is to weaken this belligerent alliance, because it is one of the sources that may give rise to adventurous actions.

We sincerely hope that the peace-loving and independent Republic of India will grow and be consolidated. (Stormy applause)

We have learned about such an unfriendly action by the Pakistani government: the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Soviet ambassador and suggested to him that I and my friend Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin refuse to visit Kashmir, and that we refuse the invitation from the Governor of your state to visit Srinagar and other areas of your state. (Laughter)

This cannot but be regarded as an unprecedented act of interfering in other people's affairs. Never before has any other country dared to instruct us where we should go, what we should do, and what kind of friends we should choose for ourselves. (Lively atmosphere in the venue, applause)

We dislike the Baghdad Pact very much, and Pakistan is one of the most active member states of this treaty, although this is by no means beneficial to itself and to its people. However, we have patience and believe that this Baghdad Pact will burst like a soap bubble, leaving only unpleasant memories. (Lively atmosphere in the venue, stormy applause)

The representative of the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said to our ambassador stationed in their country that the Pakistani government does not want us to visit Afghanistan, a country neighboring us. (Lively atmosphere in the venue) Indeed, this is going too far, and those who made such a suggestion are too nosy.

Afghanistan is our good neighbor, and we have long established friendly relations with it. (Applause) We are willing to develop and consolidate this relationship, and at the same time hope that our visit to Afghanistan can promote this. (Applause)

We are also very willing to establish such friendly relations with Pakistan, and we cannot be blamed for the fact that such relations have not yet been established. However, we will persist in striving to improve these relations for the sake of peace.

The Soviet Union has always advocated world peace and the friendship between the people of all countries and between all countries. The great Lenin instructed us to unswervingly implement this line. (Stormy applause) Therefore, we will unswervingly follow this path, consolidating and developing our friendship with other countries and people.

Long live the friendship and cooperation between the Republic of India and the Soviet Union! (Long and lasting applause)

Long live world peace! (Stormy and prolonged applause) (Xinhua News Agency, according to TASS Srinagar, 10th dispatch)

### 十二月十日在克什米尔总理举行的招待会上  赫鲁晓夫的讲话

专栏：

    十二月十日在克什米尔总理举行的招待会上
    赫鲁晓夫的讲话亲爱的朋友们：
    请首先允许我向查谟与克什米尔邦邦长尤瓦拉吉·卡兰·辛格先生、查谟与克什米尔邦总理巴克希先生、在座的全体朋友和贵邦全体人民表示衷心的感谢，感谢给予我们殷勤的招待。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们永远不会忘记克什米尔人民对我们的非常热烈的欢迎。当我们昨天乘船沿河游览的时候，河岸上挤满了欢迎我们的人群。当我们走过斯利那加的街道时，群众夹道欢迎我们，克什米尔的居民像我们曾经访问过的印度其他各城市和各省的居民一样，对于自己的朋友和兄弟——苏联人民表示了衷心的友谊和热爱，这使我们深深感动。　（掌声）
    贵邦最靠近苏联的中亚细亚各共和国——塔吉克、土库曼和乌兹别克。　（掌声）因此，我们怀着感激的心情接受了贵邦邦长、敬爱的尤瓦拉吉·卡兰·辛格请我们访问克什米尔的邀请。我们能够访问贵邦感到很高兴，因为它是你们的总理——我们所尊敬的尼赫鲁先生的故乡。　（经久不息的掌声）
    你们这里的气候同我们中亚细亚各共和国的气候相同，许多农作物也是一样的。我们来到这里之后，就好像呼吸到了我们祖国、中亚细亚南部的气息。克什米尔和贵邦首府——斯利那加城的居民就他们的民族成份上来说是不一样的。这里有克什米尔族、道格拉族、拉达克族，在克什米尔的居民中还有印度教徒、回教徒、锡克教徒及其他民族的人和其他教徒。但是，当我们走过斯利那加的街道的时候，我们感到，具有各种宗教信仰和各民族的人都一致地欢迎我们。这从欢迎标语和斯利那加居民向我们说的问候的话中可以看出来。
    这一切都是同印度共和国总理尼赫鲁的名字联系在一起的，尼赫鲁在这里同在印度的其他各邦一样享有极大的声誉和威望。　（经久不息的掌声）
    这一切都说明，包括各种民族和各种宗教信仰的查谟与克什米尔邦的人民是友好地相处的，并且竭力为自己的祖国——印度共和国做十分有益的工作。　（掌声）
    各民族的友好合作对我们来说是特别亲切和易于了解的。我们国家就它的民族成份来说是一个多民族国家。在苏联有着各种宗教信仰的人。而这一点并没有使我们有任何的隔阂，苏联人好像是一个和睦的大家庭一样在一起生活和劳动。　（掌声）
    宗教信仰的问题，这是一个每个人，每个民族的内心的问题。在我们代表团中就有乌兹别克和塔吉克的代表拉苏洛夫、拉希姆巴巴耶娃、拉希多夫，而乌兹别克和塔吉克的民族是信仰回教的民族。
    但是，在我们那里，回教徒同信仰其他宗教的人有没有什么区别呢？在我们那里，这样的区别是没有的，因为我们国家的一切民族都是伟大的苏联的当之无愧的成员，它们组成我国各族人民的大家庭。（掌声）
    在我们苏联完满地解决了民族问题以及宗教信仰自由的问题。我们每一个公民，只要他认为必要，就可以参加宗教礼拜。
    我谈起这个，是为了让你们更加清楚我们在这个问题上的立场。因为有些国家直到今天始终力图在印度各民族中间散布纠纷，煽动民族仇恨，或者按宗教信仰原则来分裂各族人民。这些国家的官方人物竭力人为地制造冲突。
    但是这一切对印度和印度各民族有好处吗？我认为，这损害整个印度的利益以及印度各族人民的利益。
    各族人民希望有机会工作、提高自己的文化、过富裕的生活。他们希望有一个不受帝国主义国家摆布的、自由的国家。
    难道这一切取决于这个民族或是那个民族信仰哪种宗教吗？我认为，不是这样。　（掌声）
    为了要有政治上的自由、要有不断提高自己的知识的机会、要有物质的保障，并不需要建立一个什么单一的宗教信仰的国家。需要的是人民要有自由，没有人剥削人的现象。　（掌声）
    我们过去和现在从来没有勉强任何人接受我们的观点和管理国家的方式。每个国家的人民能够而且必须自己解决他们应该选择怎样一种管理国家的方式和采取怎样的观念形态的问题。但是我们要指出，我国人民选择的道路已经使得他们进入发挥他们的所有创造力的全盛时期，并且提供了巨大的可能性进一步发展他们的国民经济和文化，以提高广大人民群众的福利。
    为什么产生了所谓克什米尔问题呢？这个问题不是在人民中间产生的。而是某些国家利欲薰心地在正在挣脱殖民压迫和摆脱外国压迫者的长期枷锁的那些国家的人民之间煽动敌对情绪。　（掌声）
    垄断资本家追逐的完全是自己的目的。他们教唆一个国家的一部分人民去反对另一部分人民，企图使这些国家在经济方面更加从属于他们，使这些国家服从他们的意志。
    我没有必要指出哪些国家不断在使克什米尔问题尖锐化，因为这是很清楚的事情。而这些国家也并不怎么掩饰它们对进一步使这个问题严重化的兴趣。
    安全理事会曾经讨论过克什米尔问题，苏联代表明确地阐述了我们苏联对这个问题的观点。
    在这个问题上，我们的立场是极其清楚明确的。苏联一贯认为，克什米尔的政治地位问题的解决应该是克什米尔人民自己的事情，这样才符合民主原则，才符合巩固这个地区各族人民之间的友好关系的利益。　（经久不息的掌声）苏联在克什米尔问题上抱着公正而客观的立场，对克什米尔人民和克什米尔人民的爱好和平的民主力量一贯表示深切的同情，这个力量已经同非常了解克什米尔人民的民族愿望的印度共和国中的进步的、爱好和平的力量建立了友好关系。
    事实证明，克什米尔的居民并不希望克什米尔成为帝国主义势力手里的工具。　（暴风雨般的掌声）而某些大国在支持巴基斯坦对克什米尔问题的立场的借口下，恰恰是力图使克什米尔成为他们的工具。
    如果允许的话，我想一般地谈谈我对把印度分裂为两个国家的意见。使得我们——印度的朋友感到痛心的是：帝国主义势力居然把印度分裂为两部分——印度和巴基斯坦。要知道在印度人民获得自己的国家独立以前，存在着一个统一的印度。把印度分裂为两部分的作法，并不对印度各族人民有利。正是为了这个目的，有人围绕着印度各族人民宗教信仰的不同而播弄是非，虽然宗教信仰问题决不是建立一个国家的主要问题。
    可以拿我们国家来作例子。苏联目前有一千五百多万回教徒，还有其他教徒。尽管宗教信仰不同，但是我们国家的各族人民却在和睦友爱地相处。他们建立了并且不断地加强着自己的统一的国家——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟这一社会主义国家。（掌声）
    由此可见，在建立巴基斯坦和使它从统一的印度国家分离出去的时候，居民的宗教信仰的不同并不是主要的因素。而在自己的政策中奉行大家老早已经知道的“分而治之！”的原则的其他国家，积极参加了这个事情。他们利用宗教信仰不同的因素来达到自己的目的。
    我们深信，当激烈的情绪消失和人民认识到这种人为分裂印度领土的全部含义的时候，他们将感到遗憾。
    但是建立两个独立的国家——印度和巴基斯坦的问题已经解决了，我在这一方面坦率地说出我的意见完全不是为了要在什么地方重新审议这个问题。我把这一点当作事实说出来。既然这两个国家存在着和发展着，那末现在就没有什么必要重新划分两国的国境，像某些国家所希望的那样。　（掌声）大家知道，改变国境往往是痛苦的事情，并且一定会造成流血事件。
    作为印度共和国的一个邦的克什米尔的问题已经由克什米尔人民自己解决了。这是人民自己的事情。（暴风雨般的，经久不息的掌声）我认为，双方面都需要对维护这个地区的和平表现出巨大意志，因为不论印度或者巴基斯坦都只有在和平共处的环境中才能获得发展。（掌声）
    我们同印度共和国有极其友好的关系。　（掌声）这种关系之所以产生，是因为我们把相互关系建立在人人知道的和平共处的五项原则上。我们在国际政治问题上有许多共同的看法。我们在反对建立军事集团和各种军事联盟方面站在共同的立场上。我们两国政府实行着有助于缓和国际紧张局势和阻止战争爆发的政策。
    独立的和自主的印度共和国，是正在成长的年青国家。使我们互相接近的是，这个国家正在积极地为世界和平奋斗。我们不干涉印度共和国的内政，印度也不干涉我们的内政。　（掌声）每个国家的内政，是每个国家人民自己的事。
    如果说，我们认为印度共和国是我们在争取和平、争取和平解决悬而未决的问题的斗争中的同盟者，那末遗憾的是，我们不能这样来看巴基斯坦。巴基斯坦也是一个年青的国家。但是，这个国家的统治集团所实行的政策却使我们忧虑。事实证明，他们的政策不是以自己人民、自己国家的切身利益为根据的，而是由其他国家的垄断资本集团授意的。巴基斯坦现政府公然标榜他们同美国垄断资本集团特别亲近。　（场内活跃）它是臭名昭彰的绝不是为了和平利益的巴格达条约的最先参加者和发起者之一。　（场内活跃）它准许在自己领土上建立美国军事基地，而这些基地紧紧地靠近苏联边境。
    我们坦率地说，在巴基斯坦领土上建立美国军事基地不能不使我们感到忧虑。现在在巴基斯坦的积极参加下有人正在进一步努力扩大巴格达条约成员国的数目。
    使人感到遗憾的是，伊朗政府竟跟着帝国主义势力走，而加入了这个条约。
    我们公开地说，我们从来没有支持过，而且将来也不会支持巴格达条约的参加者，如同不支持反对苏联的任何一个集团一样。
    不然的话，我们就成了政治上的盲人了。大家看得很清楚，巴格达条约的矛头是指向苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的。因此，我们的任务就是要削弱这个好战的联盟，因为它是可能产生冒险行动的根源之一。
    我们衷心希望，爱好和平的、独立的印度共和国成长和巩固起来。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们已经知道了巴基斯坦政府的下面这样一个不友好的行动：巴基斯坦外交部召见了苏联大使并且向他建议，要我和我的朋友尼古拉·亚历山德罗维奇·布尔加宁拒绝访问克什米尔，要我们拒绝贵邦邦长请我们访问斯利那加和贵邦其他一些地区的邀请。　（哄堂大笑）
    这不能不看作是一种史无前例的干涉别人的事情的行为。从来还没有过任何其他国家敢于指示我们，说我们应该到哪里去，去干些什么，应该给自己选择什么样的朋友。　（场内活跃，掌声）
    我们非常不喜欢巴格达条约，巴基斯坦就是这个条约的最积极的成员国之一，尽管这对于它自己、对于它的人民都绝没有好处。不过我们有耐心，而且相信，这个巴格达条约一定会像肥皂泡一样地破灭，留下的只不过是不愉快的回忆。　（场内活跃，暴风雨般的掌声）
    巴基斯坦外交部代表还对我们驻在他们国家的大使说，巴基斯坦政府不希望我们去访问阿富汗这个同我们相邻的国家。（场内活跃）的确，这话说的太过分了，而提这种建议的人也太好多管闲事了。
    阿富汗是我们的好邻居，我们同它早就建立了友好关系。　（掌声）我们愿意发展并且巩固这种关系，同时希望，我们的访问阿富汗能够促进这一点。
  （掌声）
    我们也很愿意同巴基斯坦建立这种友好关系，而目前这种关系还没有建立起来不能怪我们。不过，我们将为了和平事业的利益而坚持争取改善这种关系。
    苏联过去和现在始终主张全世界和平，主张各国人民之间和各个国家之间的友好。伟大的列宁嘱咐我们要坚持不渝地执行这条路线。（暴风雨般的掌声）因此我们将不屈不挠地遵循着这条道路前进，巩固和发展自己同其他国家和人民的友谊。
    印度共和国和苏联的友谊和合作万岁！（经久不息的掌声）
    世界和平万岁！（暴风雨般的，经久不息的掌声）　　（新华社据塔斯社斯利那加十日电）
