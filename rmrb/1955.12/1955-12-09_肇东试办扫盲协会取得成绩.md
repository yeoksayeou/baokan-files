    Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, has been piloting an illiteracy eradication association in Xibali Village, Sizhan District since January of this year. Currently, it has established grassroots organizations of the illiteracy eradication association in nine villages in three districts throughout the county and has established preparatory committees for the illiteracy eradication associations in the three districts, developing more than 320 members.
    Most of the members of the illiteracy eradication association have a cultural level of senior primary school, junior middle school, and illiteracy class graduates. After joining the illiteracy eradication association, they widely publicized and used their learning achievements to encourage the masses to participate in cultural learning. Before the establishment of the illiteracy eradication association in the three villages of Sizhan District, there were only 31 people engaged in illiteracy teaching. After the establishment of the illiteracy eradication association, the number of people participating in teaching increased to 80. Among them, Xibali Village originally had only seven mass teachers, and after the establishment of the illiteracy eradication association, the teaching force expanded six times. Originally, more than 280 people participated in learning in the three villages of Sizhan District. After each village combined with the pilot illiteracy eradication association to reorganize the learning organizations, the number of students increased to more than 360. When school starts this winter, the number of participants will increase nearly doubled compared to before the establishment of the illiteracy eradication association. The Yang Laiyi Agricultural Production Cooperative did not organize cultural learning in the past. After the village established the illiteracy eradication association, the person in charge of the cooperative requested the illiteracy eradication association to help the cooperative run schools.
    After the establishment of the illiteracy eradication association in Zhaodong County, the leadership of the illiteracy eradication work was strengthened. Under the leadership of the CCP branch, the illiteracy eradication associations in various villages actively assisted the government in carrying out farmers' spare-time cultural education work. The heads of the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation and other relevant parties also participated in the leadership of the association, overcoming the decentralized approach of doing things separately in the past.
    The illiteracy eradication association has adopted more learning forms in the illiteracy eradication work that are adapted to agricultural production and farmers' lives. In the nine villages of these three districts in Zhaodong County, most of the farmers were originally organized to study in relatively concentrated forms such as classes and groups. Now, due to the increase in members of the illiteracy eradication association, more than 220 people have been organized to participate in contracted teaching and guaranteed learning. Most members overcome difficulties and persevere in the illiteracy teaching work. Member Xiao Guiqin goes to the students' homes to teach every day, regardless of wind or rain.

### 肇东试办扫盲协会取得成绩

    肇东试办扫盲协会取得成绩
    黑龙江省肇东县从今年一月在四站区西八里村试办扫盲协会以来，目前已经在全县三个区的九个村建立了扫盲协会的基层组织，并且成立了三个区的扫盲协会筹备委员会，发展了会员三百二十多人。
    扫盲协会的大部分会员具有高小、初中的文化程度和扫盲班毕业的文化程度。他们参加扫盲协会以后，广泛地进行宣传，并且用自己的学习成绩，鼓动群众参加文化学习。四站区三个村建立扫盲协会以前，担任扫盲教学工作的只有三十一人，建立扫盲协会以后，参加教学工作的增加到八十人；其中西八里村原来只有七名群众教师，建立扫盲协会以后，教学力量扩大了六倍。四站区三个村原来参加学习的有二百八十多人，各村结合试办扫盲协会整理了学习组织，学员增加到三百六十多人，到今年冬季开学的时候，参加学习的人比建立扫盲协会以前增加将近一倍。杨来义农业生产合作社过去没有组织文化学习，村里建立扫盲协会以后，这个社的负责人就要求扫盲协会帮助社内办学。
    肇东县建立扫除文盲协会以后，加强了对扫盲工作的领导。各村扫盲协会在中共支部领导下，积极协助政府开展农民业余文化教育工作，青年团、妇联等有关方面的负责人也参加协会的领导，克服了过去各搞一套的分散作法。
    扫盲协会在扫盲工作中采取了更多的适应农业生产和农民生活的学习形式。肇东县这三个区的九个村原来多数采取班、组等比较集中的形式组织农民学习，现在，由于扫盲协会会员增加，已经组织二百二十多人参加包教保学。大部分会员克服困难，坚持扫盲教学工作。会员萧桂琴不管刮风下雨，每天都到学员家里去上课。   （新华社）
