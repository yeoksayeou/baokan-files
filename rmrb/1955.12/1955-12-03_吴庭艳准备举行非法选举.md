    吴庭艳准备举行非法选举
    新华社河内一日电　西贡消息：吴庭艳集团在十一月二十一日召集了南越各省省长举行会议，在会上布置了举行单独的非法选举的准备工作。
    西贡报纸消息说，吴庭艳集团可能先在各地举行“地方选举”，选出各地的“参议会”，以便在南越各地安插自己的爪牙，排斥亲法分子和反对派，使他能完全控制将来的非法选举。
    另一方面，吴庭艳集团正竭力加强法西斯统治，加紧对南越人民进行镇压和恐怖活动。吴庭艳集团在十一月二十七日成立了由吴庭艳直接指挥的“保安团”，在各地还将普遍建立乡村“保安队”。吴庭艳集团已经宣布“控共运动”进入第三阶段，在这个阶段中，要在每个村庄都成立“控共”运动的恐怖组织，并且在一些乡村中强迫人民编组编村联保。
    吴庭艳的官方报纸透露，在十月份中，吴庭艳的特务武装已经逮捕人民达八百人。而据“大越电台”说，吴庭艳集团在历次恐怖活动中已经把六万人民关进监狱。
