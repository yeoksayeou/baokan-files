    The Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation frequently organizes the families of capitalists to study
    The Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation has adopted various methods to strengthen ideological education for the family members of private industrial and commercial capitalists.
    The Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation began to establish regular contact with 303 representative families of industrial and commercial capitalists during the "Five-Anti" Movement in 1952, and established the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles Family Learning Committee. Currently, 260 people are participating in the study, most of whom are family members of members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, directors of various trade associations, and capitalists from large joint state-private factories. In addition to regular current affairs studies, the Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation also organized them to study the general tasks of the country during the transition period, the first Five-Year Plan, and the state's policies on the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and conducted many thematic discussions. The Women's Federation often organizes them to visit private factories to learn about the democratic reforms, visit joint state-private factories, and invite private representatives from joint state-private enterprises to introduce the situation of joint ventures to them. The Women's Federation also organizes them to participate in some social activities.
    After studying, these family members of private industrialists and businessmen have improved their ideological understanding to varying degrees. Many progressive elements persuade their husbands to be patriotic and law-abiding, improve their management, and actively accept transformation. Xu Shuzhen, the wife of the manager of the private Zhenxing Chang Plastic Factory in the Yimiao District, paid close attention to reducing the loss rate of products after the factory signed a sales contract with the state. She laid cardboard on the platform and on the ground, and worked with the workers to collect the scattered product scraps. More than a year later, she urged her husband to turn over these waste materials to the state at a price of 5,000 yuan. After the Shanghai Shenxin Textile Printing and Dyeing Co., Ltd. implemented joint state-private ownership, Chen Yunming, the wife of Deputy General Manager Wu Zhongyi, encouraged her husband to actively perform the duties assigned by the state and to run the enterprise well under the leadership of the public sector and the supervision and assistance of the workers. When the entire cotton industry implemented joint state-private ownership, Chen Yunming and other activists among the families of cotton textile capitalists also used their own personal experiences to publicize to the families of cotton cloth capitalists.
    Among the capitalist family members who participated in the study, many have begun to participate in housework and social work. Eighty-four people have served as neighborhood cadres, and some are working hard to learn culture and technology, preparing to participate in social labor when the country needs it.

### 上海市民主妇联经常组织资本家家属学习

    上海市民主妇联经常组织资本家家属学习
    上海市民主妇女联合会采取各种方式对私营工商业资本家的家属加强思想教育工作。
    上海市民主妇联在一九五二年“五反”运动中开始同三百零三户有代表性的工商业资本家的家属建立了经常的联系，并且成立了上海市工商界家属学习委员会。目前参加学习的有二百六十人，她们大都是工商联委员、各同业公会主任委员和大型公私合营厂资方的家属。除经常的时事学习以外，上海市民主妇联还组织她们学习了国家在过渡时期的总任务、第一个五年计划以及国家对私营工商业实行社会主义改造的政策等等，并且展开了多次的专题讨论。妇联常常组织她们参观私营工厂进行民主改革的情况，访问公私合营工厂，和邀请公私合营企业的私方代表向她们介绍合营的情况。妇联还组织她们参加一些社会活动。
    这些私营工商业者的家属经过学习以后，思想认识有了不同程度的提高。不少进步分子规劝她们的丈夫爱国守法、改善经营、积极接受改造。邑庙区私营振兴昶塑胶厂经理的妻子徐淑珍在这个厂同国家订立包销合约以后，十分注意减少产品的损耗率。她在台上、地下都铺上板纸，和工人一道把零零碎碎的产品下脚收存起来。一年多以后，她督促丈夫把这些废料作价五千元上缴给国家。上海申新纺织印染厂股份有限公司实行公私合营以后，副总经理吴中一的妻子陈韵明鼓励丈夫积极做好国家委派的职务，在公方领导和工人群众的监督帮助下搞好企业。在棉布业全业实行公私合营的时候，陈韵明还和棉纺业资方家属中的其他积极分子，根据她们自己的亲身体会，向棉布业资方家属们进行宣传。
    参加学习的资本家的家属中，许多人已经开始参加家务劳动和社会工作。有八十四人担任了里弄干部，有些人正在努力学习文化技术，准备在国家需要的时候参加社会劳动。　（新华社）
