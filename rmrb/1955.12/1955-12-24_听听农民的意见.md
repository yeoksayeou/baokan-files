Listen to the Peasants' Opinions

More than 70 percent of the products of the handicraft production cooperatives and production groups in Liaocheng County, Shandong Province, are sold locally. In the past, these products were managed uniformly by the county supply and marketing cooperative. The products went through unnecessary transfers up and down, increasing freight and costs, and also hindering the connection between producers and consumers.

In order to eliminate this abnormal phenomenon, the Liaocheng County Handicraft Industry Federation set up a joint handicraft product sales department in Chengguan in August this year, concentrating on selling products from 14 handicraft production cooperatives and groups, including 12 industries. Now, these locally produced and sold handicraft products can directly meet with the peasants. Handicraft cooperatives (groups) can directly listen to the peasants' opinions and improve production. For example, the No. 2 District Wood Industry Production Cooperative in Liaocheng changed the wide-legged cultivator to a movable-legged cultivator according to the peasants' opinions, which was welcomed by the peasants. In this way, there are no more phenomena such as backlog of products or waiting for materials to start work by improving product styles and quality at any time. At present, these cooperatives (groups) have also signed pre-purchase contracts for agricultural tools and furniture with many agricultural cooperatives, expanding the sales channels for products.

Handicraft cooperatives (groups) in various places should also use various methods to strengthen their connection with peasants.

    听听农民的意见
    山东聊城县手工业生产合作社和生产组的产品，有百分之七十以上是就地销售的。过去，这些产品都由县供销社统一经营。产品经过不必要的转上拨下，增加了运费，加大了成本，同时也妨碍了生产者和消费者之间的联系。
    聊城县手工业联社，为了消除这种不正常现象，在今年八月间在城关设立了一个手工业产品联合门市部，集中销售十四个手工业生产社、组，包括十二个行业的产品。现在，这些就地生产就地销售的手工业产品可以直接跟农民见面了。手工业合作社（组）就可以直接听取农民的意见，改进生产。如聊城二区木业生产合作社根据农民的意见把宽腿耧改成活腿耧，受到了农民的欢迎。这样，随时改进产品样式和质量，产品积压或停工待料等现象都没有了。目前这些社（组）又和许多农业合作社签订了预购农具、家具合同，扩大了产品的销路。
    各地手工业合作社（组），也应用各种办法来加强同农民的联系。
