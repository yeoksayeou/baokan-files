To the Editor:

    Our Nanjing Machine Tool Factory completed its annual total output value plan ahead of schedule on November 11th.

    During the labor emulation drive, a large number of advanced individuals emerged throughout the factory. Thirty-one workers had already completed their annual state plans ahead of schedule in November. These production activists demonstrated great ingenuity in their work and overcame all kinds of difficulties. For example, in July, the standard parts workshop had to repeatedly reverse the lathe more than ten times for each small screw, which easily caused the motor to overheat and required frequent stops, affecting the completion of production tasks. Young worker Xie Wanpeng, with the help of the Rationalization Proposals Committee, improved the thread-cutting tool. Using this tool, the screw only needed to be reversed once, which not only increased production but also extended the life of the machine tool. Another example is the veteran worker Zhu Zongchang, who actively learned the Soviet "Unanov Tool Method," increasing the feed rate, which increased production efficiency by 60% compared to general high-speed cutting, and also extended tool life and reduced auxiliary time. Furthermore, fitters Wu Renlin and Liu Chunshou worked for five consecutive days to grind the slide bore of the 1325-type hexagonal lathe, but the product did not meet the standards. Wu Renlin painstakingly studied and explored a set of "scraping methods," which was adopted by the technical department and designated as an operating procedure, rapidly improving the production situation. Wu Renlin completed the entire month's production plan in half a month, and the entire team also exceeded its November task.

    Currently, the workers of our factory are striving to comprehensively complete the 1955 national plan and the increased production and conservation plan eleven days ahead of schedule. Everyone is striving to be an active element in socialist construction!

### 南京机床厂提前完成全年总产值计划

    南京机床厂提前完成全年总产值计划编辑同志：
    我们南京机床厂在十一月十一日提前完成了全年总产值计划。
    全厂在劳动竞赛中涌现了大批先进人物，有三十一名工人在十一月份已经提前完成了全年国家计划。这些生产积极分子在劳动中发挥了高度的智慧，克服了各种各样的困难。例如，七月份标准件工段因为每车一个小螺丝钉就得连续倒顺车十多次，马达容易发热，经常需要停车，影响生产任务的完成。青年工人谢万鹏就在合理化建议委员会的帮助下，改进了丝绞板工具。用这种工具车螺丝只要倒顺车一次就行，不光提高了生产，还延长了机床寿命。又如，老工人朱宗昌积极学习了苏联的“乌纳诺夫车刀法”，加大了走刀量，生产效率比一般的高速切削还要提高百分之六十，并且还延长了刀具寿命，减少了辅助时间。再如，?刮工吴仁林和刘春寿在磨一三二五型六角车床的滑座孔的时候，连干了五天，产品都不合标准。吴仁林就苦心研究，摸索出一套“刮研方法”，被技术部门采用并订为操作规程，使生产情况迅速好转。吴仁林在半个月中就完成了全月的生产计划，全组也超额完成了十一月份任务。
    目前，我们厂的职工都在为提前十一天全面完成一九五五年的国家计划和增产节约计划而奋斗，大家都争取要在社会主义建设中当一个积极分子！
