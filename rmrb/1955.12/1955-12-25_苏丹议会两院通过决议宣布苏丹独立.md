Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Sudanese House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution on the 19th declaring Sudan a sovereign republic. The House of Representatives requested that Britain and Egypt (which had jointly administered Sudan since 1899) immediately recognize this decision.

    Previously, it had been decided to determine the fate of Sudan by holding a referendum, which would be supervised by a neutral nations committee composed of representatives from seven countries. However, on December 15th, Sudanese Prime Minister Azhari stated that the Sudanese government advocated granting Sudan immediate independence.

    Another resolution passed by the House of Representatives stipulated the establishment of a constitutional assembly to formulate a constitution for an independent Sudan. It was also decided that December 19th would be the republic's National Day.

    On the 23rd, the Sudanese Senate unanimously passed the House of Representatives' resolution declaring Sudan an independent republic. Both houses of parliament have decided to hold a meeting on the 24th to elect five members to form a committee to exercise the functions of head of state before the election of the president of the republic.

    The Sudanese public is very satisfied with these resolutions.

    According to an Agence France-Presse report from its Cairo correspondent, Egyptian Minister for Sudanese Affairs Zakaria Mohieddin, in response to a question from a reporter from "Al-Gomhouria," said that Egypt would not oppose the Sudanese Parliament's declaration of Sudan's independence. He said, "Egypt has supported the Sudanese in every stage of their opposition to British colonialism."

    According to a broadcast from London Radio, a British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 19th that Britain would discuss the Sudanese House of Representatives' resolution with the Egyptian government.

    苏丹议会两院通过决议宣布苏丹独立
    据新华社讯　苏丹议会众议院在十九日一致通过了一项宣布苏丹为有主权的共和国的决议。众议院要求英国和埃及（它们从一八九九年开始共管苏丹）立即承认这一决定。
    在这以前，曾经决定用实行公民投票的办法来决定苏丹的命运，公民投票由七个国家的代表组成的中立国委员会来监督进行。但是，苏丹总理阿扎里十二月十五日声明，苏丹政府主张立刻给予苏丹以独立。
    众议院通过的另一项决议中规定要成立制宪会议以制定独立的苏丹的宪法。另外还决定以十二月十九日为共和国的国庆日。
    苏丹议会参议院在二十三日一致通过了众议院的宣布苏丹为独立共和国的决议。议会两院已经决定在二十四日举行会议，选出五名议员来组成一个委员会，在共和国总统选出以前行使国家元首的职权。
    苏丹的公众很满意这些决议。
    另据法新社驻开罗记者报道，埃及的苏丹事务部长查卡里亚·摩海丁在答复“共和国报”记者问的时候说，埃及将不反对苏丹议会宣布苏丹独立。他说，“埃及在苏丹人反对英国殖民主义的各个阶段上都支持他们”。
    据伦敦电台广播，英国外交部发言人十九日说，英国将同埃及政府讨论苏丹众议院的决议。
