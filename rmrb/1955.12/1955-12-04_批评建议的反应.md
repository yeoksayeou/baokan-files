	Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

	After the "Reader's Letters Column" published the critical letter "Agricultural Cooperatives Should Not Conceal Production" on November 6th, the Yu She County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has already dealt with the matter. Zhang Shuzhen, the head of the Xiaolidãozhuang Agricultural Cooperative, repeatedly committed similar errors, and despite repeated education, refused to reform. He has been expelled from the Party and sentenced to three months of imprisonment according to law. The County Committee has also criticized other Party members within the cooperative and has circulated the matter to all Party branches in the county for discussion.

	After the "Reader's Letters Column" published the article "We Must Attach Importance to Handling People's Letters" on October 23rd, the Secretariat of the Qingyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has examined the shortcomings in the handling of people's letters, such as the imperfect registration system for receiving and dispatching correspondence, and is determined to improve it in the future. The Supervisory Office of the Jilin Forestry Industry Administration examined the shortcoming of relaxing supervision and inspection after forwarding mass letters, and plans to conduct a review of letters that have not yet been closed recently. The Secretariat of the Zongyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party examined the phenomenon of delaying the handling of letters forwarded by this newspaper for more than nine months (during which only one preliminary reply was made) and is determined to correct this procrastination in the future. The Office of the Haikang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party reviewed its perfunctory and sloppy attitude in handling mass opinion letters and accepted mass opinions, urging the County People's Government to restore the work of receiving people's visits.

    批评建议的反应
    十一月六日“读者来信专页”发表了“农业社不应该隐瞒产量”的批评信以后，中共榆社县委已经对这件事作了处理。小里道庄农业社社长张书珍几次犯同类性质的错误，屡教不改，已被开除党籍，并依法判处有期徒刑三个月。县委对社内其他党员也进行了批评，又把这件事通报全县各党支部进行讨论。
    十月二十三日“读者来信专页”发表了“必须重视处理人民来信的工作”一文后，中共清原县委秘书室已经检查了处理人民来信工作中收发登记制度不健全的缺点，决心今后加以改进。吉林森林工业管理局监察室检查了把群众来信下转以后就放松督促检查的缺点，准备在最近对还没有结案的来信进行清理。中共枞阳县委秘书室检查了对本报转去信件拖延九个多月才处理完毕（在这期间只作了一次初步答复）的现象，决心在今后纠正这种拖拉作风。中共海康县委办公室检讨了处理群众意见信的敷衍草率态度，并且接受群众意见，督促县人民政府恢复了接见人民来访的工作。
