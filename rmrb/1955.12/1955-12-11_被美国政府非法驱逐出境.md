Xinhua News Agency, December 10th dispatch from New York: Claudia Jones, a leader of the American Communist Party and a well-known African-American leader, was illegally deported by the U.S. government and left New York by ship for England on the 9th.

Jones was one of the famous figures in the U.S. authorities' persecution of communists, the so-called "Thirteen Person Case." She was arrested in June 1951 along with twelve other leaders of the American Communist Party. In 1953, she was sentenced to one year and one day in prison and a fine of $2,000 under the Smith Act on the charge of conspiring to incite the overthrow of the U.S. government. Afterwards, Jones was released on bail to pursue legal proceedings, but her appeal was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. After Jones completed her sentence and was released from prison on October 23 of this year, the U.S. authorities had been plotting to deport her.

    被美国政府非法驱逐出境
    新华社十日讯　纽约消息：美国共产党领导人之一、著名的美国黑人领袖克劳迪亚·琼斯被美国政府非法驱逐出境，在九日从纽约乘船前往英国。
    琼斯是美国当局迫害共产党的著名的“十三人案件”中的一人。她在一九五一年六月同美国共产党另外十二个领导人同时被捕，一九五三年，被根据史密斯法以所谓阴谋教唆推翻美国政府的罪名，判处一年零一天的徒刑和两千美元罚金。此后琼斯曾被保释在外进行法律程序的斗争，但是她的上诉被美国最高法院所拒绝。今年十月二十三日琼斯服刑期满出狱后，美国当局就一直策划把她驱逐出境。
