　　Xinhua News Agency report: Guatemala held "elections" for the National Assembly and municipal bodies on December 18th. News from Guatemala shows the anti-democratic and illegal nature of these "elections."
　　During the lead-up to the elections, the reactionary dictatorial regime of Castillo Armas suppressed all parties and organizations opposing its policies, passed election laws prohibiting opposition parties from participating in the elections, and allowing the reactionary parties supporting the government to do whatever they wanted.
　　The Guatemalan people boycotted these "elections." According to Reuters, only 40 percent of those who participated in the January 1953 general election participated in these "elections."

    危地马拉在恐怖气氛下举行“选举”
    据新华社讯　危地马拉在十二月十八日举行了国民议会和市机构的“选举”。来自危地马拉的消息表明了这些“选举”的反民主和非法性质。
    在准备选举期间，卡斯蒂略·阿马斯的反动独裁政权镇压了反对它的政策的各党派和组织，通过了禁止反对党派参加选举并且使支持政府的反动党派可以为所欲为的选举法。
    危地马拉人民抵制了这些“选举”。据路透社报道说，参加“选举”的人只有参加一九五三年一月大选的人的百分之四十。
