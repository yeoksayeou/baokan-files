Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 23rd: The All-Japan Trade Union Council held a meeting of its executive committee on the 21st to discuss the policy for the spring struggle next year.

    The meeting decided that in the spring of next year, trade unions in government agencies and public corporations should unite with trade unions in private enterprises to carry out a unified struggle centered on raising wages to maintain livelihoods.

    The meeting also decided to launch a nationwide movement against the expansion of U.S. military bases and against the government's attempts to maliciously revise labor laws and reform the education system.

    Prior to this, according to Kyodo News, the leading body of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, a union of Japanese capitalists, recently held an emergency meeting, unanimously agreeing that "wage increases should be restricted" in order to "cope with the labor offensive."

    日本工会总评议会决定明年春季斗争方针
    新华社二十三日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会在二十一日举行干事会会议，讨论了明年春季的斗争方针。
    会议决定明年春季要使政府机关和公共企业的工会同私人企业的工会联合起来，统一进行以提高工资为中心的维护生活的斗争。
    会议还决定展开全国反对扩大美国军事基地的运动，反对政府企图恶劣地修改劳工法律和恶劣地改革教育制度的计划。
    在这以前，据共同社透露，日本资本家联合组织——日本经营者团体联盟的领导机构最近曾举行紧急会议，一致认为“应该限制工资的提高”，“以对付劳工攻势”。
