    To the Editor:
    The People's Committee of the Left Wing Rear Banner of Horqin, Inner Mongolia, has recently moved to Ganqika Town. This small town in the desert, after years of construction, has become unrecognizable: two rows of tall shelterbelts stand like a green wall, blocking the strong southwest wind; rows of new houses built in the meadow south of the street stretch for more than two li, forming neat and beautiful streets; the number of residents has increased from more than 300 households to more than 1,000.
    What kind of disaster had happened here six years ago! Every spring, the strong wind rolled up the billowing yellow sand, darkening the sky. The wind tore the window paper, the sand blew into the houses, the firewood stacks and sheep flocks were blown away, and the wells were filled with sand. During these days, residents dared not light a fire to cook for several days. The seeds painstakingly sown by the farmers were often blown away, and even the seedlings that grew up might be buried by the shifting sand at any time!
    For hundreds of years, people have been forced to move frequently to escape the disaster of wind and sand.
    In 1948, Ganqika was liberated. After the completion of the land reform, the people's government called on the local people to plant trees on a large scale to fight against wind and sand. According to the terrain and wind direction, four windbreak barriers more than 1,000 meters wide were planted in Nanhetuo mound. This spring, more than 80,000 walnut, locust, maple, and other trees were planted on the south "Aobao" mound – it has become a garden for people to visit. Self-growing forests and forests surviving before liberation have also been protected. Every tree-planting season, Ganqika boils, with young people, old people, and women vying to participate in tree planting. Sometimes the newly planted trees were buried by strong wind and sand, and people re-erected them; if there were no seedlings, the masses would automatically go to Zhangwu County, more than 100 li away, to buy them. In order to eliminate wind and sand as soon as possible, the people here plant trees for three seasons every year.
    Tree planting not only fixed the shifting sand and blocked the wind speed, but also the humus formed by fallen leaves retained water and soil, bringing years of bumper harvests to agricultural production. The people of Ganqika are now enjoying the fruits of their labor, living and working happily here.
                                                                                                                  Wang Mengqi

### 甘旗卡人民战胜了风沙

    甘旗卡人民战胜了风沙编辑同志：
    内蒙古科尔沁左翼后旗人民委员会最近迁到了甘旗卡镇。这座沙漠上的小镇，经过这几年的建设，已经变得使人难以辨认了：有两座房高的防护林带像一堵绿墙，阻挡了强烈的西南风；街南草甸子里新建的一排排的房屋，伸展出二里多路，形成了整齐美观的街道；居民已由三百多户增加到一千多户了。
    在六年以前，这里曾经有过什么样的灾难啊！每逢春天，大风卷起了滚滚的黄沙，使天空都昏暗了。风撕破了窗纸，沙子刮进了房屋，柴禾垛和牛羊群被卷走了，水井里也填满了沙子。在这些日子里，居民几天也不敢点火煮饭。农民们辛勤播下的种子经常被刮跑了，即使生长起来的禾苗也说不定什么时候被流沙埋没！
    几百年来，人们为了躲避风沙的灾难，经常被迫搬家。
    一九四八年，甘旗卡解放了。土地改革完成以后，人民政府就号召当地人民大规模地造林来向风沙作斗争。依据地势和风向，在南河坨模种成了一千多公尺宽的四道防风障。今年春天，在南“奥包”坨子又栽了胡桃、洋槐、枫树等八万多棵——这里已成为一座供人们游玩的花园了。自生林和解放前残存的树林也受到了保护。每逢造林季节，甘旗卡就沸腾起来，青年、老年、妇女都争先恐后地参加植树。有时新栽的树被大风沙埋没了，人们又重新把它架起来；没有树秧，群众便自动地到一百多里地的彰武县去买。为了早日消灭风沙，这里的人们每年有三个季度造林。
    造林不仅固定了流沙，阻挡了风速，而且由枯叶变成的腐蚀物还保持了水土，给农业生产带来了连年的丰收。甘旗卡人民现在享受了自己劳动所创造的成果，愉快地在这里生活和工作着。  王梦起
