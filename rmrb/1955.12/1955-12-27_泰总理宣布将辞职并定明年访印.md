Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram announced at a press conference in Bangkok on the 23rd that he intends to resign next month. Plaek Phibunsongkhram also stated that if the Speaker of the Parliament recommends him to the King as the head of the new government, he would be willing to form a cabinet.

According to the Indian Press Trust, Plaek Phibunsongkhram has been asking some of his colleagues to resign, but they have refused. According to the Thai constitution, the Prime Minister cannot ask his colleagues to resign, so the only way to remove unwanted ministers is for the Prime Minister to resign and form a new cabinet.

Plaek Phibunsongkhram also announced that he had accepted an invitation to visit India and will travel there next year, but the date has not been set. He said that he will also visit Laos and Cambodia before the next rainy season.

    泰总理宣布将辞职并定明年访印
    据新华社讯曼谷消息：泰国总理銮披汶二十三日在曼谷举行的记者招待会上宣布，他打算在下个月辞职。銮披汶又表示，如果议会议长向国王建议由他出任新政府首脑，他将愿意组阁。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，銮披汶一直在要求他的一些同僚辞职，但是他们拒不辞职。按照泰国宪法，总理不能要求他的同僚辞职，因此唯一排斥不要的部长办法是总理辞职另组新阁。
    銮披汶并且宣布他已经接受了去印度访问的邀请，将于明年前往，但日期未定。他说，他也将在下次雨季之前访问老挝和柬埔寨。
