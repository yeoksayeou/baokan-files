    The Ugly Face of Colonial Rule Defenders
    On December 2nd, the U.S. State Department issued a joint communique after talks between U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Cunha. The communique specifically mentioned that the U.S. government supports Portugal's position on the occupation of the Indian territory of Goa, referring to Goa as a "Portuguese province in the Far East."
    As everyone knows, Goa is an integral part of Indian territory. Portugal only invaded and occupied Goa in the early 16th century. For more than four hundred years, the patriots of Goa have never ceased their struggle against foreign colonial rule. Since India gained independence, the Indian people have resolutely demanded an end to Portuguese rule in Goa, so that Goa can return to the embrace of its motherland. This demand of the Indian people is entirely just.
    Portugal's colonialist stance of continuing to occupy Goa has been morally isolated after being condemned by people all over the world. Now, the United States is openly taking a position of sheltering and abetting Portugal's occupation of Goa. People see that after the release of the U.S.-Portuguese joint communique, the Portuguese authorities have begun to issue barbaric howls about the Goa issue. Portuguese Foreign Minister Cunha not only openly stated that he would continue to uphold colonial rule over Goa, but also falsely accused India of harboring some kind of "imperialist ambition." It is very clear that the Portuguese colonialists are so arrogant because they have received encouragement from the United States.
    The Washington ruling clique pays lip service to portraying itself as a "hero" of "anti-colonialism." Everyone remembers that when the Asian-African Conference unanimously condemned the scourge of colonialism in April this year, the U.S. government even expressed "welcome." Now, the United States' active support for Portugal's occupation of the Indian territory of Goa nakedly exposes the true face of American colonialism. In fact, the United States has consistently colluded with the Portuguese colonial authorities in an attempt to turn Goa into an aggressive base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Dulles once expressed the United States' "concern" about the situation in Goa, and the U.S.-Portuguese joint communique now proves what this "concern" means.
    Obviously, the United States' open support for Portugal's occupation of Goa is a blatant interference in Indian sovereignty and is therefore intolerable to the Indian people. The U.S.-Portuguese joint communique has already aroused great indignation in Indian public opinion.
    There is no doubt that the just demand of the Indian government and people to recover Goa has received the sympathy and support of people all over the world. Recently, Soviet leaders, during their visit to India, expressed warm sympathy and support for India's desire to recover Goa.
    The Chinese people believe that Goa is Indian territory, and no foreign country should interfere with India's sacred right to exercise sovereignty over Goa. The United States' attempt to obstruct the anti-colonialist movement of the Asian people and to save and consolidate the colonial rule of Western countries in this region is fundamentally impossible. This action by the United States can only once again expose its ugly face of maintaining colonial rule before the people of Asia and the world.

### 殖民统治维护者的丑恶面目

    殖民统治维护者的丑恶面目
    十二月二日，美国国务院发表了美国国务卿杜勒斯同葡萄牙外交部长保罗·库纳会谈后的联合公报。公报特别提到，美国政府支持葡萄牙侵占印度领土果阿的立场，并把果阿称为“葡萄牙在远东的省份”。
    大家知道，果阿是印度不可分割的领土。直到十六世纪初，葡萄牙才侵占了果阿。四百多年来，果阿的爱国者从来没有停止过反对外国殖民统治的斗争。自从印度获得独立以后，印度人民坚决要求结束葡萄牙在果阿的统治，使果阿回到祖国的怀抱。印度人民的这一要求是完全正义的。
    葡萄牙继续侵占果阿的殖民主义立场，在遭到了全世界人民的谴责以后，已在道义上陷于完全孤立的地位。现在，美国竟公然对葡萄牙侵占果阿的行径采取庇护和怂恿的态度。人们看到，在美葡联合公报发表后，葡萄牙当局又开始发出对于果阿问题的横蛮的叫嚣。葡萄牙外交部长库纳不仅公开声称要继续维护对果阿的殖民统治，而且诬蔑印度怀着什么“帝国主义野心”。十分明白，葡萄牙殖民者所以如此嚣张，显然是因为它得到了美国的鼓励。
    华盛顿统治集团口口声声把自己说成是“反殖民主义”的“英雄”。大家还记得，在今年四月间亚非会议一致谴责殖民主义的祸害时，美国政府还曾表示“欢迎”。现在，美国积极支持葡萄牙对印度领土果阿的侵占，就赤裸裸地暴露了美国的殖民主义的真面目。事实上，美国一贯勾结葡萄牙殖民当局，企图把果阿变成北大西洋公约组织的一个侵略基地。杜勒斯曾经表示美国对于果阿局势的“关心”，而现在发表的美葡联合公报就证明了美国的这种“关心”究竟意味着什么。
    显然，美国公开支持葡萄牙侵占果阿的行为，这是对印度主权的露骨的干涉，因而是印度人民所不能容忍的。美葡联合公报已经引起了印度公众舆论的极大的愤慨。
    毫无疑问，印度政府和人民收复果阿的正义要求，是得到了全世界人民的同情和支持的。最近，苏联领袖在访问印度时，对于印度要求收复果阿的愿望，就表示了热烈的同情和支持。
    中国人民认为，果阿是印度的领土，任何外国不得干涉印度对果阿行使主权的神圣的权利。美国妄图阻挠亚洲人民的反殖民主义运动，挽救和巩固西方国家在这个地区的殖民统治，这是根本办不到的。美国的这个行动只能在亚洲和全世界人民面前再一次暴露出它维护殖民统治的丑恶面目。
