Two new-type cotton ginneries were built in the southern Xinjiang area in November. One of the factories was built on the Victory Farm in the Aksu Reclamation Area of the Production and Construction Corps. This factory has three workshops: ginning, baling, and power. The power engines, cotton gins, and baling machines are all manufactured by state-owned factories in our country. After the workers' operating skills are proficient, they can gin more than 13,000 jin of cotton per day.

The other factory was built in Makit County, one of the key cotton-growing counties in southern Xinjiang. This factory is equipped with Soviet eighty-saw cotton gins, which can gin 30,000 jin of seed cotton per day. The cotton bales produced by its baling machine are small in volume and high in density, so there is no loss of tonnage in loading and transportation. The completion of this factory not only completely solved the cotton ginning and baling problems in Makit County, but also, because the new-style cotton gin replaced the old-style cotton gin used by farmers, it also overcame the difficulties of long fibers and difficult threshing of Soviet cotton varieties. It will play a significant role in promoting the cultivation of high-yielding and high-quality Soviet cotton varieties.

    新疆南部建成两座新型轧花厂
    新疆南部地区在十一月份建成两座新型轧花厂。其中一个厂建筑在生产部队阿克苏垦区的胜利农场。这个厂有轧花、打包和动力三个车间，动力机、轧花机和打包机都是我国国营工厂制造的。在工人操作技术熟练后，每天可以轧花一万三千多斤。
    另一个厂建筑在南疆重点植棉县之一的麦盖提县。这个厂装有苏联的八十锯齿轧花机，每天可以轧籽棉三万斤。它的打包机打出的棉花包，体积小、密度大，在装车运输上不亏损吨位。这个厂的建成，不但彻底解决了麦盖提县的棉花轧花和打包问题，而且由于新式轧花机代替了农民使用的旧式轧花机，也克服了苏联种棉花纤维长、不易脱粒的困难，对于推广种植产量高、质量好的苏联棉种将起很大作用。（本报集体通讯员新疆日报编辑部）
