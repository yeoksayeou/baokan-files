    The Legal Publishing House has compiled and published a collection of essays by the outstanding Soviet jurist, Academician Andrei Yanuarevich Vyshinsky, entitled "Problems of the Theory of State and Law." The book contains fifteen essays by Academician Vyshinsky on theoretical issues of state and law, written between 1938 and 1953.

    In several essays, such as "The Problem of Law and State in Marx's Works" and "Lenin and Stalin on State and Law," Vyshinsky systematically expounds the basic Marxist-Leninist theories of state and law, especially the basic theories concerning the origin and historical types of state and law, as well as their class essence. Because the issues of state and law are more closely related to the interests of the ruling class than any other issue, bourgeois scholars strive to confuse the issues of state and law. They either see state and law as incomprehensible and mysterious things, or they see state and law as so-called "eternal and unchanging truths," "justice" that is above everything else. Bourgeois scholars attempt to defend the capitalist system of exploitation by distorting the essence of state and law. In his works, Vyshinsky relentlessly exposed and criticized the anti-scientific and idealistic views of bourgeois scholars on these issues.

    In several essays, such as "The Soviet State is a New Type of State," "Soviet Socialist Law," and "The Victory of the Principles of the Soviet State Constitution," Vyshinsky, based on Lenin and Stalin's theories on proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, on the functions of the socialist state and its two main stages of development, on the theory of socialist democracy, on the theory of strengthening and consolidating the socialist legal system, and on the theory that the Soviet socialist state and law are powerful tools for building communism, enthusiastically demonstrated the superiority of the Soviet socialist state and law, and pointed out the fundamental differences between the Soviet socialist state and law and the state and law of all exploiters. In societies where the exploiting classes are in power, the state and law are a means of consolidating the system of exploitation of man by man, and a means of depriving the broad masses of exploited and oppressed people of their freedom and equal rights. In socialist society, the state and law are a means of abolishing the system of exploitation of man by man, a means of affirming the legal equality of people, and a means of fighting for the victory of the principle of economic equality for people.

    In essays such as "The Basic Tasks of Soviet Socialist Legal Science" and "Several Issues in Soviet Legal Science," Vyshinsky sharply exposed the errors and shortcomings that existed in Soviet legal circles and argued for the basic tasks of Soviet socialist legal science.

    Since the establishment of the Soviet state, for a long period, the Trotsky-Bukharin gang, headed by Pashukanis, Krylenko, Berman, and other traitors, had entrenched themselves in Soviet legal circles, monopolizing the theoretical research work of Soviet law. They disguised themselves as "defenders" of Marxism-Leninism, but in reality, they engaged in selling out the Soviet motherland for a long time. The "formula" previously formulated by Bukharin, that the state should wither away immediately after the victory of the October Revolution and under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, had long been sharply criticized and ridiculed by Lenin. However, these bandits, based on Bukharin's "formula," promoted the so-called "theory" of "legal nihilism" everywhere.

    In response to the fallacy of "legal nihilism," Vyshinsky systematically elucidated the basic Marxist-Leninist theories of state and law, especially the theory on the issue of the withering away of the state. He pointed out that Marxism-Leninism regards the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialist law as levers for the victory of socialism, and powerful tools for the communist transformation of society. Marxism-Leninism believes that under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, under the circumstances of capitalist encirclement, not only should the state and law not wither away, but they must be greatly strengthened and consolidated. Otherwise, it would be impossible to guarantee the victory of socialism and communism.

    After exposing and smashing the sabotage activities of the wreckers under the leadership of the Party and the state, the primary task of Soviet legal circles was to continue to eliminate all the remnants of the wreckers' sabotage activities. Soviet legal science workers should regard the maximum development and consolidation of the Soviet state and law as their task, and legal science should focus all its attention on this.

    As early as 1938, Vyshinsky pointed out that Soviet legal science was facing many major tasks; a series of issues arising from the tasks of socialist construction needed to be studied from a legal point of view. Among the most important issues was the issue of defining "the definition of law."

    Based on the Marxist-Leninist theory of state and law, Vyshinsky elaborated on this issue in detail while criticizing various distortions of bourgeois idealism. Together with other Soviet jurists, he made the first attempt to give a correct definition of law. That is: "Law is the sum total of rules of conduct prescribed in legislative form expressing the will of the ruling class, and customs and rules of public life recognized by state power, and the state guarantees its implementation with coercive force in order to protect, consolidate, and develop social relations and order that are beneficial and agreeable to the ruling class." (See page 100) Although this definition was made in 1938, its basic content is still unanimously accepted by Soviet legal circles. This definition laid the foundation for in-depth research on the basic theoretical issues of various departments of legal science.

    Bourgeois idealistic viewpoints were not only expressed in the research work on basic theoretical issues of legal science such as "the definition of law," but also in various departments of Soviet legal science. Therefore, carrying out a deep and specific struggle against bourgeois idealism in various departments of Soviet legal science is the most important task of Soviet legal science. Based on his practical experience in judicial and diplomatic work for a long time, Vyshinsky cited many examples in his essays (such as the issue of "accomplice" in criminal law, the issues of "sovereignty" and "definition of aggression" in international law, etc.) to vividly illustrate the poisoning of Soviet legal science by bourgeois idealistic ideas, and specifically criticized the bourgeois idealistic viewpoints expressed in various departments of Soviet legal science based on the theoretical principles of Marxism-Leninism and using the dialectical materialism method.

    Vyshinsky's essays on the basic tasks of Soviet socialist legal science have given us a lot of enlightenment on the issue of criticizing bourgeois idealistic viewpoints. In our judicial work departments, although the old legal viewpoints of bourgeois idealism have been criticized to a certain extent in the judicial reform movement in 1952, the criticism is still very incomplete, and the remnants of the old legal viewpoints still exist. Therefore, systematically, deeply, criticizing and eliminating bourgeois idealistic viewpoints will remain an important task in our work for a relatively long period of time in the future.

    In this collection of essays, Vyshinsky particularly emphasized the importance of systematically studying and mastering the Marxist-Leninist methodology and the Marxist-Leninist theory of state and law. As early as 1938, he pointed out that it was entirely possible for Soviet legal science workers to find inexhaustible wealth in the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to solve a series of major current issues in various departments of legal science. Vyshinsky sharply criticized the intolerable indifference of Soviet legal circles towards the great legacy of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. In the following ten years or so, Vyshinsky successively published his own essays that systematically sorted out, studied, and elaborated on the basic Marxist-Leninist theories of state and law in combination with practical experience. Our young legal circles urgently need to study Marxism-Leninism. As we can see in this collection of essays, Vyshinsky's essays have set a brilliant example for us to systematically, deeply, and especially learn Marxism-Leninism by linking theory with practice.

    介绍维辛斯基的“国家和法的理论问题”
    张尚鷟
    法律出版社编译出版了苏联杰出的法学家安·扬·维辛斯基院士的论文集“国家和法的理论问题”。全书共选辑维辛斯基院士自一九三八年至一九五三年期间有关国家和法的理论问题的论文十五篇。
    在“马克思著作中的法和国家问题”、“列宁斯大林论国家和法”等几篇论文中，维辛斯基系统地阐述了马克思列宁主义关于国家和法的基本理论，特别是关于国家和法的起源和历史类型以及它们的阶级本质等基本理论。因为国家和法的问题比其他任何问题都更关联到统治阶级的利益，所以资产阶级学者们竭力把国家和法的问题弄得混乱不堪。他们不是把国家和法看成为不可理解的神秘的东西，就是把国家和法看成是所谓“永恒不变的真理”、超于一切之上的“公正”。资产阶级学者们想借歪曲国家和法的实质来替资本主义剥削制度作辩护。维辛斯基在他的著作中无情地揭露和批判了资产阶级学者们在这些问题上的反科学的、唯心主义的观点。
    在“苏维埃国家是一个新型的国家”、“苏维埃社会主义的法”和“苏维埃国家宪法原则的胜利”等几篇论文中，维辛斯基根据列宁斯大林关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说、关于社会主义国家职能及其两个主要发展阶段的学说、关于社会主义民主制的学说、关于加强和巩固社会主义法制的学说以及关于苏维埃社会主义的国家和法是建成共产主义的有力工具的学说，热情地论证了苏维埃社会主义国家和法的优越性，指出了苏维埃社会主义的国家和法同一切剥削者的国家和法的根本区别。在剥削阶级当权的社会里，国家和法是巩固人剥削人的制度的一种手段，是剥夺广大被剥削被压迫人民的自由和平等权利的一种手段。在社会主义社会里，国家和法是废除人剥削人的制度的手段，是确认人们在法律上平等的手段，是为人们在经济上平等这一原则的胜利而斗争的手段。
    在“苏维埃社会主义法律科学的基本任务”、“苏维埃法律科学中的几个问题”等篇论文中，维辛斯基尖锐地揭露了苏维埃法学界所存在过的错误和缺点，论证了苏维埃社会主义法律科学的基本任务。
    自从苏维埃国家建立以来，在很长一个时期中，以巴舒坎尼斯、克雷连柯、别尔曼及其他叛徒为首的托洛茨基—布哈林匪帮，曾盘踞在苏维埃法学界中，垄断着苏维埃法的理论研究工作。他们伪装成马克思列宁主义的“捍卫者”，实际上长期地从事出卖苏维埃祖国的勾当。从前布哈林所制定的关于在十月革命刚一胜利后、在无产阶级专政条件下国家就应消亡的“公式”早就被列宁尖锐地批驳和嘲笑过。可是这些匪徒们却根据布哈林的“公式”到处宣传“法律虚无主义”的所谓“理论”。
    维辛斯基针对着“法律虚无主义”的谬论，系统地阐明了马克思列宁主义关于国家和法的基本理论，特别是关于国家消亡问题的理论。他指出：马克思列宁主义把无产阶级专政的国家和社会主义法看成是社会主义取得胜利的杠杆，是对社会实行共产主义改造的有力工具。马克思列宁主义认为在无产阶级专政的条件下，在资本主义包围的形势下，不但不应该使国家和法消亡，而且还必须大大地加强和巩固国家和法。否则就不可能保证社会主义和共产主义的胜利。
    苏维埃法学界，在党和国家的领导之下揭露和粉碎了暗害分子的破坏活动以后，首要的任务就在于要继续肃清暗害分子破坏活动的一切残余。苏维埃法律科学工作人员，应该把最高限度地发展和巩固苏维埃国家和法当作自己的任务，法律科学应当把全部注意力集中在这上面来。
    还在一九三八年时，维辛斯基就曾指出，苏维埃法律科学面临着许多重大的任务；由社会主义建设任务所产生的一系列问题，需要从法律上来加以研究。而其中最重要的问题，则是关于确定“法的定义”的问题。
    维辛斯基根据马克思列宁主义关于国家和法的理论，在批判资产阶级唯心主义的各种歪曲的同时详细地论证了这一问题。他同其他苏维埃法学家一起，共同作出了第一次给法下一个正确定义的尝试。那就是：“法是以立法形式规定的表现统治阶级意志的行为规则和为国家政权认可的风俗习惯和公共生活规则的总和，国家为了保护、巩固和发展对于统治阶级有利的和惬意的社会关系和秩序，以强制力量保证它的施行。”（见第一○○页）这个定义，虽然是在一九三八年作出的，但它的基本内容，直到现在，仍为苏维埃法学界一致接受。这个定义为深入地研究法律科学各个部门的基本理论问题奠定了基础。
    资产阶级唯心主义的观点，曾经不但表现在像“法的定义”这样的法律科学基本理论问题的研究工作中，而且还表现在苏维埃法律科学的各个部门中。因此深入而具体地在苏维埃法律科学的各个部门中展开对于资产阶级唯心主义的斗争，乃是苏维埃法律科学的最重要的任务。维辛斯基根据他长期从事司法工作和外交工作的实际经验，在他的论文中举出了许多例子（如刑法中的“共犯”问题，国际法中的“主权”问题、“侵略定义”问题等等），生动地说明资产阶级唯心主义思想对苏维埃法律科学的毒害，并根据马克思列宁主义的理论原理，运用辩证唯物主义方法，具体地批判了表现在苏维埃法律科学各个部门中的资产阶级唯心主义观点。
    维辛斯基论述苏维埃社会主义法律科学基本任务的几篇论文，在批判资产阶级唯心主义观点的问题上，给了我们很多的启发。在我国司法工作部门中，资产阶级唯心主义的旧法观点，虽然在一九五二年的司法改革运动中，已受到了一定程度的批判，但批判得还很不彻底，旧法观点的残余依然存在。因而，系统地、深入地批判和肃清资产阶级唯心主义观点，在今后较长的一段时期中，仍然是我们工作中的一项重要任务。
    维辛斯基在这本论文集中特别强调地论证了系统学习和掌握马克思列宁主义方法论和马克思列宁主义关于国家和法的理论的重要性。早在一九三八年时，他就指出，苏维埃法律科学工作人员，完全有可能在马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的著作中，找到取之不尽的财富，来解决法律科学各个部门当前的一系列重大问题。维辛斯基尖锐地批评了苏维埃法学界对待马克思、恩格斯和列宁伟大遗产所采取的不能容忍的冷淡态度。在此后的十多年中，维辛斯基陆续发表了他自己结合实际经验系统地整理、研究和阐述马克思列宁主义有关国家和法的基本理论的论文。我国年轻的法学界，迫切地需要学习马克思列宁主义。正如我们在这本论文集中所看到的，维辛斯基的这些论文，为我们树立了系统地，深入地，特别是理论联系实际地学习马克思列宁主义的光辉榜样。
