    The First Match of the Romanian Volleyball Team in Beijing
  　Chong Yuan
    The Romanian national men's volleyball team, which won second place in the 1955 European Volleyball Championship, played a wonderful friendly match with the men's volleyball team of our Central Institute of Physical Education at the Beijing Gymnasium on the evening of the 23rd.
    From the very beginning of the match, it was clear that the Romanian volleyball team was a very strong team. In the first game, the diagonal spikes of Roman Stefan, captain of the Romanian team number one, the left-handed attacks of Nicolau Horatiu, team member number two, and the straight spikes of Medeanu Dumitru, the tall player number four, were unstoppable. In addition, the Central Institute of Physical Education team seemed too nervous and made too many serving errors, and the battle ended fifteen to six.
    In the second game, the Central Institute of Physical Education team played more calmly. Although the Romanian team was in the lead, the Central Institute of Physical Education team did not relax. When the score reached nine to six, Roman Stefan, the captain of the Romanian team number one, showed his power again, scoring consecutive points with long-range spikes and close-range dinks, bringing the score to fourteen to eight. However, the Central Institute of Physical Education team was not discouraged. After a back-and-forth struggle, they chased all the way to twelve to fourteen. Finally, the Romanian team added another point and won the second game.
    The third game was the most tense game of this match. The Central Institute of Physical Education team strengthened its collective blocking and used diverse tactics such as "quick sets" and "cross screens" in the attack, and the score increased rapidly, from two to two, all the way to a ten to two lead. Subsequently, the Romanian team used the height advantage of its players to perform high-ball spikes, catching up to eight to twelve. After ten to fourteen, the competition between the two sides became more intense, with the right to serve being contested back and forth more than ten times. Finally, the Romanian team number one's dink went out of bounds, and the Central Institute of Physical Education team won back a game with fifteen to eleven.
    The result of the fourth game was eight to fifteen. The Romanian team won the match with a score of three to one.
    The first match of the Romanian volleyball team in Beijing has been unanimously praised by our audience, who believe that this volleyball team has a very high level in both offense and defense and is a very excellent volleyball team.

    罗马尼亚排球队在京的第一场比赛
  　重远
    曾经获得一九五五年欧洲排球冠军赛第二名的罗马尼亚国家男子排球队，二十三日晚上在北京体育馆和我国中央体育学院男子排球队作了一次精彩的友谊比赛。
    比赛一开始，就显出罗马尼亚排球队是一支实力很强的球队。在第一局中，罗马尼亚队一号队长罗曼·斯特凡的斜线扣杀，二号队员尼科劳·霍拉蒂尤施展的左手攻击，以及身材高大的四号队员梅迪亚努·杜米特鲁的直线扣球，都锐不可挡。加上中央体育学院队显得过分紧张，发球失误太多，十五比六就结束了战斗。
    第二局中央体育学院队打得比较沉着一些，罗马尼亚队比分虽然领先，但是中央体育学院队也不放松。到九比六时，罗马尼亚队一号队长罗曼·斯特凡又施展威力，远扣、近吊连连得分，比数已到十四比八。但是中央体育学院队并不气馁，经过来回拉锯，一直追到十二比十四。最后，罗马尼亚队又添一分，胜第二局。
    第三局是这场比赛最紧张的一局。中央体育学院队加强了集体拦网，在进攻中使用“快板”“交叉掩护”的多样战术，积分迅速增加，从二比二，一直打到十比二领先。随后，罗马尼亚队利用队员身高的特点，进行高球扣杀，追至八比十二。到十比十四以后，双方的争夺更为激烈，来回争夺发球权达十多次。最后，罗马尼亚队一号吊球出界，中央体育学院队以十五比十一争回一局。
    第四局的结果是八比十五。罗马尼亚队以三比一获得了这场比赛的胜利。
    罗马尼亚排球队在京的第一场比赛，已经得到了我国观众的一致好评，认为这个排球队无论在进攻上和防守上都有极高的水平，是一个很优秀的排球队。
