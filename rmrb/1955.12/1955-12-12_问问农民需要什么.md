Ask the Peasants What They Need

    In order to support the agricultural cooperation movement and deliver the goods that peasants need and like into their hands, three supply and marketing cooperatives and thirteen state-owned specialized companies in the eastern suburbs of Shenyang City jointly held a commodity exhibition and appraisal meeting, inviting peasant representatives from twenty-eight nearby villages to visit and appraise the goods.

    At the meeting, the peasant representatives visited and appraised 357 kinds of means of production and 1,600 kinds of consumer goods. Li Shaorong, the director of the Yuanye Agricultural Production Cooperative, pointed to the new burlap sacks and said to the director of the supply and marketing cooperative: "Why doesn't our supply and marketing cooperative prepare such goods?" Everyone also criticized the ropes sold by the supply and marketing cooperative: they are too weak and not durable. In principle, a set of ropes should last for two years, but the ones sold by the supply and marketing cooperative break after only half a year. Everyone also criticized and offered opinions on the supply and marketing cooperative's limited variety of industrial products.

    Hearing the opinions of the peasants, the staff of the supply and marketing cooperative felt as if a window had been opened in their minds. The director of the Lixiangtun Supply and Marketing Cooperative said: "I never expected that peasants would have so many demands. In the future, we can no longer be timid and afraid to stock up on goods!" The director of the Wangbingou Supply and Marketing Cooperative immediately wrote out an order list based on the needs of the peasants. The Zhujiatun Supply and Marketing Cooperative also added more than 300 new commodities.

    Currently, in many places, state-owned commercial departments are stockpiling goods that cannot be sold, while peasants cannot buy satisfactory goods. The key lies in the fact that the staff of the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives do not understand the needs of the peasants, or they are "timid" and dare not purchase goods. Organizing commodity exhibition and appraisal meetings, using vivid facts to open the eyes of the staff of the supply and marketing cooperatives, and enabling them to see the changes in the rural market and understand the preferences and demands of the peasants, is a good way to break down the artificial blockages between urban and rural areas, meet the needs of the peasants, and promote industrial production.

    问问农民需要什么
    为了支援农业合作化运动，把农民需要的、喜欢的商品送到农民手里，沈阳市东郊区的三个供销合作社和十三个国营专业公司，联合举办了一个商品展览鉴定会，邀请附近二十八个村的农民代表来参观和鉴定。
    在会上，农民代表们参观、鉴定了三百五十七种生产资料和一千六百种生活资料。原野农业生产合作社主任李绍荣指着新麻袋对供销合作社主任说：“为啥咱供销社没预备这样货？”大家对供销社经营的绳索也提出了批评：劲太小，不耐用，按理一付绳套能使用两年，可是供销社卖的用半年就坏了。大家对供销社经营的工业品种太少，也提出了批评和意见。
    听到农民提的这些意见，供销合作社的工作人员心里好像开了窗户。李相屯供销社主任说：“真没想到农民有这么多要求，今后可再不能小手小脚地不敢办货啦！”王滨沟供销社主任当时就根据农民需要，写了要货单。祝家屯供销社也增加了三百多种新商品。
    现在有许多地方，国营商业部门积压着商品卖不出去，而农民又买不到称心的东西。关键就在于基层供销合作社的工作人员不了解农民的需要，或者是“小手小脚”不敢进货。组织商品展览鉴定会，用活生生的事实打开供销合作社工作人员的眼睛，使他们看到农村市场的变化，了解农民的爱好和要求，这是打通城乡之间人为阻塞，满足农民需要和促进工业生产的一个良好方式。
