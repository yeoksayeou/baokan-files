Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd. News: The Chinese Scientific Delegation to Japan held a press conference in Tokyo on the 22nd before leaving. The delegation issued the following statement to the journalists at the conference:

    At the invitation of Mr. Seiji Kaya, President of the Science Council of Japan, our Scientific Delegation from the People's Republic of China came to Japan for academic visits and friendly exchanges. From December 1st to 22nd, we spent three unforgettable weeks in Japan with pleasure.

    During this period, we visited cities such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, Chiba, Ichikawa, Okayama, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Shimonoseki, Yawata, and Toyohashi, and also toured scenic spots such as Hakone, Nara, and Miyajima. Wherever we went, we were greeted with warm, brotherly welcomes and cordial receptions from the Japanese academic community and other sectors. As we are about to leave Japan, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude once again.

    During this period, we visited many universities and academic institutions in Japan, and also had extensive contact and sincere conversations with Japanese academics. We have learned a lot of useful things from the Japanese academic community. Many people in the Japanese academic community have expressed their hope to restore and develop academic and cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan, in order to enhance the friendship between the two peoples and promote the normalization of relations between the two countries. We are very pleased about this, because this is precisely the wish of the Chinese academic community and the Chinese people. Like our Japanese colleagues, we sincerely hope that our delegation's visit to Japan will further promote academic and cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan.

    During this period, we also had the opportunity to meet with people and the masses from all walks of life in Japan. We conveyed the Chinese people's respect and wishes for the hard-working and courageous Japanese people, and also learned about the lives and aspirations of the Japanese people who are struggling hard to defend their national interests. We deeply feel that the Chinese and Japanese peoples are like brothers. The friendship between the two peoples has a history of more than two thousand years, and both peoples hope to restore and develop this traditional friendship on a new basis. Despite the different social systems, both peoples have the desire for peaceful coexistence. Despite some artificial obstacles, both peoples demand the early realization of the normalization of relations between the two countries. And despite some external forces attempting to sow discord, both peoples realize that restoring and developing friendly relations between China and Japan not only conforms to the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also conforms to the fundamental interests of maintaining peace in Asia and the world. This common feeling and wish of the Chinese and Japanese peoples is deeply rooted, and no force can thwart its growth, just as no force can change the Earth's orbit around the sun.

    Our visit to Japan, although short, has been fruitful, the impressions are profound, and the future memories will be even more far-reaching. As we leave Japan, in addition to expressing our gratitude, we would like to express once again the Chinese people's wishes for the hard-working and courageous Japanese people: May the Japanese people achieve common and universal happiness and prosperity, may the Chinese and Japanese peoples always have friendly exchanges and peaceful coexistence, and may the Chinese and Japanese peoples join hands and work together to maintain peace in Asia and the world!

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd. News: The Chinese Scientific Delegation to Japan held a grand farewell banquet at the Tokyo Kaikan on the evening of the 21st.

    About one thousand people from all walks of life in Japan and representatives of overseas Chinese and Korean residents were invited to attend the banquet.

    Also invited to the banquet were Fusanosuke Kuhara, Chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union, Jiichiro Matsumoto, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Tetsu Katayama, Chairman of the Japan National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, Yoshitaro Hirano, Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, Iku Yasui, Secretary-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Yuichi Horie, Vice-Chairman of the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Shiji Yoshida, Chairman of the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Organizations, and other representatives of mass organizations; Ujaku Akita, Dean of the Stage Arts Academy, Jianzi Guan, Stalin International Peace Prize winner and musician, and other famous figures in the cultural field, as well as managers and directors of well-known manufacturers.

    Dumnitsky, head of the Soviet delegation in Tokyo, and others were also invited to attend the banquet.

    Guo Moruo first delivered a speech, saying that although the Chinese Scientific Delegation to Japan's visit to Japan was short, the gains were great. The biggest gain was to see with their own eyes that Japanese academics and the Japanese people, like Chinese academics and the Chinese people, hold the common desire to develop the two peoples' traditional friendship of two thousand years on a new basis, to carry out cultural and economic exchanges between the two countries, and to practice peaceful coexistence. The Chinese people are willing to join hands with the Japanese people to work together to realize this common wish.

    Seiji Kaya then delivered a speech, saying that thanks to the Chinese Scientific Delegation to Japan's visit to Japan, academic exchanges between Japan and China will be further developed in the future, and this exchange is the foundation for the two peoples to join hands in establishing new friendly relations.

    Many other guests also spoke during the banquet.

    During the banquet, the guests frequently toasted to Japan-China friendship and to peace in Asia and the world.

    我国访日科学代表团离东京前发表声明
    并在东京会馆举行盛大的辞行宴会
    新华社二十二日讯　东京消息：中国访日科学代表团二十二日在离开东京前，举行了记者招待会。代表团在会上向新闻记者发表了如下的声明：
    我们中华人民共和国访日科学代表团应日本学术会议会长茅诚司先生的邀请，到日本来进行学术视察和友好访问。从十二月一日起至二十二日止，我们在日本愉快地度过了令人难忘的三个星期。
    在这个期间，我们访问了东京、京都、大阪、名古屋、仙台、千叶、市川、冈山、广岛、福冈、下关、八幡、丰桥等城市，也游览了箱根、奈良、宫岛等名胜。无论去到那里，我们都受到日本学术界和其它各界人士亲如兄弟一般的热诚的欢迎和殷勤的接待。在我们即将离开日本的时候，我们愿意再一次表示衷心的感谢。
    在这个期间，我们对日本的许多大学和学术机关进行了视察，并且同日本学术界人士进行了广泛的接触和恳切的交谈。我们从日本学术界学习到很多有益的东西。日本学术界的许多人士都表示希望恢复和发展中日两国人民之间的学术和文化的交流，以便增进两国人民的友谊和促进两国关系的正常化，对此我们感到十分的喜悦，因为这正是中国学术界和中国人民的愿望。我们同日本学术界人士一样，深愿我们这个代表团的访问日本能够进一步促进中日两国人民之间的学术和文化的交流。
    在这个期间，我们还获得机会同日本各方面的人士和群众见面。我们传达了中国人民对于勤劳勇敢的日本人民的敬意和祝愿，同时也了解了正在为保卫自己的民族利益而进行艰苦奋斗的日本人民的生活和愿望。我们深切地感到中日两国人民是亲弟兄。两国人民的友谊有两千年以上的历史，两国人民也都希望在新的基础上恢复和发展这种传统的友谊。尽管社会制度不同，两国人民都有和平共处的愿望。尽管还有某种人为的障碍，两国人民都要求早日实现两国关系的正常化。也尽管还有某种外来势力企图进行挑拨离间，两国人民也都认识到，恢复和发展中日两国的友好关系不仅符合两国人民的根本利益，而且也符合维护亚洲和世界和平事业的根本利益。中日两国人民的这种共同的感情和愿望是根深柢固的，任何力量都不能挫折它的生长，正像任何力量都不能改变地球的绕日运行一样。
    我们这次访问日本，时间虽然很短，收获却是丰硕的，印象也是深刻的，将来的回忆更是深远的。在我们离开日本的时候，我们除了表示感谢而外，还愿意再一次表达中国人民对于勤劳勇敢的日本人民的祝愿：祝日本人民获得共同的普遍的幸福和繁荣，祝中日两国人民永远友好往来和和平共处，祝中日两国人民携手并肩共同为维护亚洲和世界的和平而努力！
    新华社二十二日讯　东京消息：中国访日科学代表团二十一日晚间在东京会馆举行了盛大的辞行宴会。
    应邀参加宴会的有日本各界人士和华侨、朝鲜侨民的代表共约一千多人。其中有日本学术会议会长茅诚司，前东京大学校长南原繁，东京大学校长矢内原忠雄，九州大学校长山田穰等大学校长，教授和其他学术界人士；参议院议长河井弥八，众议院副议长杉山元治郎，前文部大臣、自由民主党国会议员松村谦三，社会党主席铃木茂三郎，劳农党主席黑田寿男，共产党国会议员志贺义雄等政界人士。
    应邀参加宴会的还有日本恢复日中日苏邦交国民会议会长久原房之助，日中友好协会会长松本治一郎，日本拥护宪法国民联合会主席片山哲，日本拥护和平委员会总书记平野义太郎，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会事务总长安井郁，日苏亲善协会副会长堀江邑一，日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章，全日本产业别工会会议主席吉田资治等各群众团体的代表；舞台艺术学院院长秋田雨雀，“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人、音乐家关鉴子等文化界著名人士以及著名厂商的经理和董事。
    苏联驻东京代表团团长多穆尼茨基等也应邀参加了宴会。
    郭沫若首先致词说，中国访日科学代表团访问日本的期间虽然很短，但是收获却很大。最大的收获就是亲眼看到日本学术界人士和日本人民同中国学术界和中国人民一样，抱着在新的基础上发展中日两国人民两千年来的传统友谊，进行两国文化、经济的交流和实行和平共处的共同愿望。中国人民愿意同日本人民携起手来，为实现这个共同愿望而共同努力。
    茅诚司接着致词说，由于中国访日科学代表团到日本访问，今后日中两国间的学术交流将会进一步发展，这种交流是两国人民携起手来建立新的友好关系的基础。
    其他许多来宾也在席间讲了话。
    席间，宾主频频为中日友好、为亚洲和世界的和平而干杯。
