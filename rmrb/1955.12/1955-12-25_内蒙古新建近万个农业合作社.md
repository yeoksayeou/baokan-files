Nearly Ten Thousand New Agricultural Cooperatives Established in Inner Mongolia

By mid-December, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had newly established nearly ten thousand agricultural production cooperatives. Together with the previous six thousand-plus agricultural cooperatives, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has reached 50% of the total number of peasant households. The number of households joining cooperatives in the Hetao Administrative Region and the Jerim League has greatly exceeded the original plan.

The newly established agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have basically ensured quality. After the establishment of these cooperatives, they have actively added carts and horses and carried out winter production. In addition to providing strong economic support to agricultural production cooperatives, the people's governments at all levels are also preparing to train more than 17,000 accountants and technicians for agricultural production cooperatives.

    内蒙古新建近万个农业合作社
    内蒙古自治区到十二月中旬，已经新建立农业生产合作社将近一万个，连同以前的六千多个农业社，入社农户已经占总农户的百分之五十。河套行政区、哲里木盟入社农户数都大大超过原定计划。
    各地新建的农业生产合作社，基本上保证了质量。这些社建立以后，都纷纷添车买马，开展冬季生产。各地人民政府除在经济上给予农业生产合作社以大力支援外，还准备为农业生产合作社训练会计和技术员各一万七千多名。
