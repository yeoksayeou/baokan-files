    Mass Production of Small Internal Combustion Engines for Agricultural Service
    National People's Congress Representative Lu Jingyun
    Editor's Note: The development of the agricultural cooperative movement nationwide requires the industry to supply more means of production to rapidly increase agricultural production. Comrade Lu Jingyun inspected some rural areas and factories and proposed producing 400,000 horsepower of small internal combustion engines within the first Five-Year Plan. It is hoped that relevant departments can earnestly study this proposal, formulate specific measures for the mass production and promotion of small internal combustion engines, and serve the future national agricultural production increase movement.

    Not long ago, I studied the issue of manufacturing small internal combustion engines to serve agricultural production. Evidence from various sources proves that if the production of small internal combustion engines can be organized now and supplied to rural areas in large quantities, it can both unleash the potential of China's machinery manufacturing industry and rapidly increase crop yields. This is a very important task.

    Some Examples
    To illustrate the importance of manufacturing small internal combustion engines for agricultural production, I will first cite a few examples to show the current situation of some rural areas using internal combustion engines, and some cases of increased production and reduced production costs after using internal combustion engine-powered machinery.

    1. Wuxi County's Situation
    In June of this year, I went to East China to inspect and learned about the use of small internal combustion engine-powered irrigation in Wuxi County. According to comrades Dai Liansheng and Gu Jinsheng, director and staff of the Wuxi County Farmland Irrigation Management Office, the county has a 30-year history of using mechanical irrigation. A total of 900,000 mu of rice paddies in the county need irrigation, of which 87% are irrigated by machinery.

    Currently, Wuxi County has 1,044 irrigation machines, totaling 19,623 horsepower, of which more than 96% are privately owned and organized and led by the government. Among these internal combustion engines, 40% use firewood or anthracite coal as power fuel, and 60% use diesel. The county only uses 80% of all equipment, and the remaining 20% is used to support neighboring counties.

    Their irrigation costs are 2.6 yuan per mu for high-lying fields and 2.25 yuan per mu for low-lying fields, plus fuel costs of about 1 to 2 yuan. Usually, each machine (averaging about 20 horsepower) can replace more than 100 laborers, and the unit area yield is higher than that of irrigation without machines. In 1954, Wuxi County experienced 60 consecutive days of heavy rain, and 216,000 mu of fields were affected by the disaster. Through the centralized use of machines to drain water and rescue the disaster, only 21,000 mu of fields were lost, and 195,000 mu of fields were rescued, accounting for 90.3%. The harvest value of these fields in 1954 was more than 8 million yuan, while the value of all the machines in the county was estimated to be no more than 7 million yuan.

    Wuxi County also has several electric irrigation stations invested and operated by farmers themselves. I visited one of them, the Zhongqiao Electric Irrigation Station. This irrigation station has a set of 15 kW motors driving water pumps where low-voltage transmission lines pass, and also made some simple cement main canals, water diversion gates, and earth branch canals. This irrigation station was built with the help of national loans. The farmers paid off the loans in only two years, the method being to contribute 8 yuan per mu of benefited paddy field in the first year and 4 yuan per mu in the second year. Now all the management work is handled by the farmers themselves, and from this year onwards, each mu only needs to pay a usage fee (including electricity) of 2.5 yuan, which is cheaper than using a diesel engine.

    2. The Situation of Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative
    According to the data published by Chen Yongkang, a national agricultural labor model and director of the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, at the symposium on mechanical irrigation and drainage work convened by the Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources in 1954, the cooperative has 2,576 mu of paddy fields, and the government has established a pumping station. They have learned four benefits from practice:

    First, using machines to pump water can ensure reasonable irrigation and guarantee a bumper harvest of rice. At various stages of rice growth, the fields need different depths of water. For large areas of paddy fields, pumping water by oxcart is slow and cannot guarantee timely and adequate water supply. Using mechanical irrigation, one machine can irrigate more than 100 mu a day, and can also supply water in time in case of drought. Comparing irrigation with pumps and oxcarts, it is estimated that each mu can increase rice production by 50 to 100 jin.

    Second, using machines to pump water can save a lot of labor. After using machines to pump water, they reduced the number of ox-powered waterwheels in the cooperative, saving a total of 5,900 workdays per season for oxcart watchers, installers, dismantlers, and repairmen. They used this saved labor to plow the fields half an inch to one inch deeper, transplant the seedlings densely and evenly, do fine weeding and harrowing work, accumulate more than 80,000 dan of various fertilizers, and expand the area of summer crops by 616.5 mu of wheat, 399.2 mu of rapeseed, and 20 mu of barley. The income from these aspects can be increased by an average of 60 yuan per household. They also took advantage of the gap before the autumn harvest to open fish ponds and build pig houses, which is estimated to increase the cooperative's income by 4,000 yuan.

    Third, using machines to pump water can save funds, reduce costs, and expand reproduction. After using machines to pump water, they reduced the number of cattle from 100 to 58, saving 6,300 yuan in funds, and used these funds to increase the fertilizer application by an average of 2.5 yuan per mu. In terms of pumping costs, using oxcarts to pump water generally costs 2.7 yuan per mu, and high-lying fields cost 4 yuan; using machines to pump water costs only 2.47 yuan per mu (including canal labor, aqueducts, gates, compensation for damaged land, machine rooms, machine foundations, and machine depreciation), which is 0.23 yuan cheaper than the general cost.

    Fourth, using machines to pump water can improve irrigation technology and promote the consolidation and improvement of cooperatives.

    3. The Situation in Hebei Province
    The Jin County Party Committee of Hebei Province made a comparison between irrigating with locomotive boilers (a type of steam engine) and irrigating with waterwheels, with the following results:

    Investment Comparison: Among the more than 300,000 mu of dry land in the county, if 150,000 mu are irrigated with locomotive boilers, 167 sets of locomotive boilers are required (based on each set irrigating 900 mu, irrigating 60 mu day and night, and irrigating once every half month). The cost of each set of locomotive boiler and well drilling is 8,400 yuan, requiring an investment of more than 1.4 million yuan. If 150,000 mu of land are irrigated with waterwheels, 5,000 wells need to be dug (each well irrigating 30 mu), costing 1.5 million yuan; 5,000 waterwheels are needed, costing 500,000 yuan; 1,250 additional livestock are needed (each animal irrigating 40 mu of dry land and 30 mu of paddy fields), costing 200 yuan per animal, totaling 250,000 yuan. The total cost of the three items is 2.25 million yuan, which is 850,000 yuan more than using locomotive boilers.

    Yield Comparison: If 150,000 mu of dry land is planted with food crops, the normal yield is 117 jin per mu converted to grain. After becoming paddy fields, the yield increases by 30 jin per mu in the first year, 60 jin per mu in the second year, and 104 jin per mu in the third year (the third year can be equal to the yield of paddy fields, with 221 jin per mu), with a total increase of 15.6 million jin of grain per year. If cotton is planted, the dry land yields 80 jin of cotton per mu. After becoming paddy fields, the yield increases by 30 jin per mu in the first year, 60 jin per mu in the second year, and 90 jin per mu in the third year, with a total increase of 13.5 million jin per year.

    In addition, reducing one livestock saves about 600 jin of grain, equivalent to the harvest of 3.5 mu of grain fields. Reducing 1,250 livestock is equivalent to increasing the harvest of 4,375 mu of grain fields.

    From the above examples, replacing manual or animal-powered irrigation with small power machinery can not only reduce irrigation investment and costs, but also significantly increase grain and cotton production. Currently, of China's billions of mu of cultivated land, only about 6 million mu have used mechanical irrigation, and the installed power machinery is less than 200,000 horsepower, which shows that there is still a vast scope for promoting the use of small power machinery for irrigation, and we also need to do everything possible to promote small power machinery.

    Strive to Produce 400,000 Horsepower of Irrigation Equipment
    To supply these machines to rural areas, we must first organize production well. At present, the increase rate of irrigation machinery nationwide is less than 30,000 horsepower per year, which is far from the demand. Secondly, we should consider refitting the 16,000 horsepower of diesel engines, 3,000 water pumps, and other machinery of this kind that are currently overstocked by the Ministry of Commerce and other industrial departments, so that they are suitable for farmland irrigation, and then supply them to rural areas in a planned way. The imported diesel engines currently stocked by the Ministry of Commerce are not convenient for use in rural areas because they have higher speeds and require light diesel as fuel, but they can be converted into gas engines and their speed reduced. Doing so will reduce horsepower and adjust the selling price, but it is better to be suitable for rural use and to be effective immediately than to be overstocked in warehouses for a long time.

    If we can use various methods to organize the machinery industry to increase mechanical irrigation equipment by another 400,000 horsepower during the first Five-Year Plan period, and make it play its greatest role, we will have the following results in the national economy:

    If 400,000 horsepower of irrigation equipment is used in areas with better conditions, based on each horsepower irrigating 50 mu of land (currently some areas are 10 mu, and some areas are more than 50 mu), a total of 20 million mu of land can be irrigated. If 20 million mu of land are planted with grain, with an increase of 50 to 100 jin per mu, the annual increase will be 1 billion to 2 billion jin. If each jin of raw grain is priced at 8 fen, the value will be 80 million to 160 million yuan. In disaster years, if 4 million mu of fields are protected, with a harvest of 300 jin per mu, 1.2 billion jin can also be protected.

    The fixed asset investment for 400,000 horsepower of machinery and equipment is about 120 million yuan. If the annual increase in grain value is 80 million to 160 million yuan, deducting annual depreciation and management fees of about 50 million yuan, the national wealth can be increased by 30 million to 100 million yuan per year, and the investment can be recovered in two or three years.

    If such measures prove their effectiveness during the first Five-Year Plan period, the mechanically irrigated area can continue to increase by about 20 million mu each year during the second Five-Year Plan. By the end of the second Five-Year Plan, China can have about 120 million mu of mechanically irrigated paddy fields, and the increased grain production can reach 10 billion jin per year.

    Manufacturing and Usage Issues
    I have visited several factories in China that specialize in internal combustion engines, and learned about the work of the specialized bureaus that lead these factories. The production capacity of the factories I contacted accounts for 90% of the state-owned internal combustion engine industry. Based on what I have learned, it can be seen that China's internal combustion engine manufacturing industry, whether in terms of scale, technical equipment, number of employees, technical level, management level, product variety, and production volume, has greatly exceeded the level before liberation. At present, the leading departments of the machinery industry are starting to formulate a series table of internal combustion engines, selecting standard models, studying the rational division of labor among factories, organizing factories to solve key technical problems, and supervising factories to improve product quality and reduce the reject rate. These situations are satisfactory, and they are all due to the correct leadership of the government and the efforts of the staff.

    However, there are still some problems with these industries. The most prominent one is that, on the one hand, many new products needed by the country cannot be produced, and on the other hand, some state-owned factories and most local factories have few production tasks, while the production capacity for general products is very large, resulting in a phenomenon of not being "fed enough." In such a situation, if these production capacities can be organized, based on the majority of local factories and led by a few state-owned factories, and given the task of manufacturing a large number of farmland irrigation machines, on the one hand, the irrigation of the vast farmland can be gradually mechanized, and on the other hand, these factories that are "not fed enough" with new products can be "fed enough," and their strength can be fully utilized to serve the current urgent task of agricultural production increase.

    Currently, under relatively normal conditions in state-owned factories, the average annual output per person is about 35 horsepower. Under mass production conditions, it is estimated that it can be increased by 40%. Therefore, if a factory of about 1,000 people can be extracted from the state-owned power machinery factories, and 4,000 people can be organized in local factories, totaling about 5,000 people, then about 400,000 horsepower of power machines can be manufactured in about 20 months. If another 2,000 people are organized from general machinery factories to manufacture water pumps and auxiliary machinery, then 400,000 horsepower of irrigation equipment can be supplied to agriculture successively in 1957.

    After having the equipment, it is still difficult to organize a large number of farmers to manage and use these machines in a short period of time, but the difficulties can be overcome. According to the data of Wuxi County, 97% of the more than 3,200 machine operators in the county are farmers. At present, if some idle manpower from power machinery manufacturing factories and electrical machinery manufacturing factories can be mobilized to go to the countryside to help and teach a group of farmers to manage the machines, a large number of new machine operators can be trained in each farming season, so that they can manage these machines independently in the second year. The irrigation season is only three or four months each year. In order to transfer manpower, the production tasks of the machinery factories can be appropriately adjusted to adapt to the farming season, so that about 20,000 workers can be temporarily mobilized from factories with insufficient tasks to act as a bridge for the mechanization of farmland irrigation. Of course, this involves a lot of organizational mobilization work, and requires the cooperation of industrial and agricultural departments, trade union organizations, and local party and government organizations to do a lot of work. This action itself means a positive measure of the worker-peasant alliance, and has practical significance for improving the political awareness of workers and peasants.

    The regions for promoting the use of small internal combustion engines should first focus on the river and lake water network areas and polder areas, and then extend to the traffic routes in North China and Southwest China, so that they can play a greater role and reduce difficulties such as fuel supply. Wherever there is a power grid, electricity should be used as much as possible; in areas where the power supply is not sufficient, the local competent authorities should adjust non-productive electricity consumption during the farming season to supply agriculture. In the water network areas of southern Jiangsu, internal combustion engines can be installed on ships for mobile use; in North China and other areas that rely on wells, small horsepower locomotive boilers can be used for fixed use.

    According to local experience, the most suitable investment method is people-run and government-assisted. Farmers can be widely mobilized to invest. Generally, loans can be provided by the government or banks, and farmers will repay the funds annually according to the benefited fields until all are repaid, and then only need to pay usage fees each year. In this way, the difficulty of farmers lacking large amounts of funds in the early stage is overcome, and the state funds are not overstocked for too long. However, the lighter the investment burden on farmers, the greater the possibility of promotion and the more economic benefits will be obtained; therefore, the focus must be on reducing manufacturing costs when supplying irrigation machinery. I have estimated that it is possible to reduce the selling price of small gas engines to 150 yuan per horsepower.

    Conclusion
    In general, on the one hand, mechanical irrigation has a rapid and significant effect on increasing agricultural production, but the use of such machinery is not yet widespread; on the other hand, there is a large amount of idle machinery manufacturing capacity nationwide. There is a disconnect in between. To eliminate this disconnect, the relevant departments should first jointly formulate specific plans, allocate manpower, materials, and financial resources, and designate several factories to coordinate and refit the power irrigation equipment stocked by the Ministry of Commerce and other departments, so that they can be effective in the next irrigation season, and at the same time start to organize the idle forces of state-owned and local factories to manufacture various small irrigation machinery in the next year. Secondly, the party and government authorities in the relevant regions should mobilize farmers to invest in the use of machine irrigation, and mobilize workers to go to the countryside during the farming season to directly serve the peasants, so as to ensure that the equipment can achieve the expected increase in production.

    The significance of such work is huge, and we should pay more attention to studying these issues to make it more concrete and feasible. We must do everything possible to tap the potential of the machinery manufacturing industry, help our peasant brothers, and strive to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the agricultural production increase plan.

    大量制造小型内燃机为农业服务
    全国人民代表大会代表  陆景云
    编者按：农业合作化运动在全国范围内的开展，要求工业供给更多的生产资料，以便迅速提高农业生产。陆景云同志视察了一些农村和工厂，提出争取在第一个五年计划内生产四十万马力小型内燃机的建议。希望有关部门能够切实研究这个建议，制定大量制造和推广小型内燃机的具体办法，为今后全国农业增产运动服务。
    不久以前，我曾研究了制造小型内燃机为农业生产服务的问题。从各方面的材料证明，如果目前能组织小型内燃机的生产，大批供应农村，既可以发挥我国机械制造工业的潜力，又可以迅速提高农作物的产量。这是一项很重要的工作。
    举几个事例
    为了说明制造小型内燃机为农业生产服务的重要性，我先举几个例子，说明目前某些农村使用内燃机的现状，和使用内燃动力机械后提高产量、降低生产成本的一些情况。
    一、无锡县的情况
    今年六月，我去华东视察，曾经了解了无锡县利用小型内燃动力机灌溉的情况。据无锡县农田灌溉管理所所长戴连生和顾金生两位同志谈，这个县用机械灌溉已经有三十年的历史，全县需要灌溉的水稻田共九十万亩，其中用机械灌溉的占百分之八十七。
    目前，无锡县共有灌溉机器一、○四四台，计一九、六二三马力，其中百分之九十六以上是民营的，由政府组织领导。这些内燃机用木柴或白煤作动力燃料的占百分之四十，用柴油的占百分之六十。全部设备中本县只用了百分之八十，其余百分之二十是用来支援邻县的。
    他们的灌溉费用，高田每亩二·六元，低田每亩二·二五元，外加燃料费约一至二元。在平时每台机器（平均约二十马力）可抵劳动力一百多人，单位面积产量比不用机器灌溉的高。一九五四年，无锡县连续六十天大雨，有二十一万六千亩田受灾，经集中机器排涝救灾，只有二万一千亩田受了损失，救出了十九万五千亩田，占百分之九十点三。这些田在一九五四年的收获价值有八百多万元，而上述该县全部机器的价值，估计不过七百万元。
    无锡县还由农民自己投资办了若干电力灌溉站。我曾去参观了其中之一的中桥电力灌溉站。这个灌溉站在低压输电线经过的地方，有一套十五瓩的电动机带动水泵，还做了一些简单的水泥总渠，分水闸及土沟分渠。这个灌溉站是由国家贷款帮助建成的。农民只用两年时间就还清了贷款，方法是第一年每亩受益水田出资八元，第二年每亩出资四元。现在所有的管理工作都由农民自己办理了，从今年起每年每亩只要出使用费（包括电费）二元半，比使用柴油机便宜。
    二、联民农业生产合作社的情况
    据全国农业劳动模范、江苏省松江县联民农业生产合作社社长陈永康在水利部农田水利局所召开的一九五四年机械灌溉排水工作座谈会所发表的资料，该社有水稻田二、五七六亩，由政府建立了一个抽水机站，他们从实际中体会到四点好处：
    第一，用机器抽水可以掌握合理灌溉，保证水稻丰收。水稻生长的各个阶段，田里需要不同深度的水。大面积的稻田，用牛车抽水较慢，不能保证及时有适量的水。用了机械灌溉，一部机器一天能灌溉一百多亩，遇天旱也能及时供水。如果拿抽水机灌溉和牛车比较，估计每亩可以增产五十到一百斤稻谷。
    第二，用机器抽水以后，可以节约大量劳动力。他们社里用了机器抽水以后，减少了牛力水车，每季可以节省看牛车工、装拆及修理牛车棚的人工共五千九百个工。他们利用这些省下来的人工把田耕深了半寸至一寸，把秧插得密插得匀，耘荡工作做得精细，多积了各种肥料约八万多担，扩大了夏熟作物面积计小麦六一六·五亩、油菜三九九·二亩、大麦二十亩。这些方面的收入，平均每户可增加六十元。他们还利用秋收前的空隙开鱼塘修猪舍，估计养鱼能使全社增加收入四千元。
    第三，用机器抽水可节约资金，降低成本，扩大再生产。他们社里用机器抽水后，把养牛数自一百头减少到五十八头，节约了资金六千三百元，利用了这些资金每亩平均增加了二元半的肥料。在抽水成本方面，用牛车抽水每亩一般要二·七元，高田要四元；用机器抽水每亩只要二·四七元（包括渠道人工，渡槽，闸门，压毁土地的赔偿费，机房，机座及机器折旧费等），比一般的还便宜○·二三元。
    第四，用机器抽水可以改进灌溉技术，促进合作社的巩固和提高。
    三、河北省的情况
    河北省晋县县委曾经作过锅驼机（蒸汽机的一种）浇地同水车浇地的比较，情况如下：
    投资比较：全县三十余万亩旱地中，若用锅驼机浇十五万亩，需用锅驼机一百六十七套（以每套浇地九百亩计，昼夜浇地六十亩，半月浇一次水）。每套锅驼机和凿水井费以八千四百元计，需投资一百四十万多元。十五万亩地，如用水车浇，须打水井五千眼（每眼浇地三十亩），用款一百五十万元；需水车五千架，用款五十万元；增加牲口一千二百五十头（旱地每头浇四十亩，水地每头浇三十亩计），每头二百元，用款二十五万元。三项共用款二百二十五万元，比用锅驼机多投资八十五万元。
    产量比较：十五万亩旱田如种粮食作物，以常年产量折谷计算每亩产一一七斤，变水田后第一年每亩增产三十斤，第二年每亩增产六十斤，第三年每亩增产一○四斤（第三年能同水地产量相等，每亩产二二一斤）每年共增产粮食一、五六○万斤。如种棉花，则每亩旱地产棉八十斤，变水地后第一年增产三十斤，第二年增产六十斤，第三年增产九十斤，每年共增产一、三五○万斤。
    此外，减少一个牲口，按节约粮食六百斤计算，约合三亩半的粮田收成。减少一、二五○头牲口，即可相当于增加四、三七五亩粮田的收成。
    从以上例子看来，以小型动力机器代替人力或畜力灌溉，不但能降低灌溉的投资和成本，还能显著地增产粮棉。目前我国十几亿亩的耕地中，已经使用机械灌溉的还只有六百万亩左右，装用的动力机器还不到二十万马力，这说明了还有很广阔的范围来推广使用小型动力机械灌溉，我们也有必要尽一切可能推广小型动力机械。
    争取生产四十万马力灌溉设备
    为了供应农村这些机械，首先就应该很好地组织生产。目前全国灌溉机械的增加速度，每年不到三万马力、这跟需要相距很远。其次，应该考虑把商业部现已积压的柴油机一万六千匹、水泵三千台和其他工业部门积压的这类机械加以改装，使之适合农田灌溉的需要，然后有计划地供给农村。目前商业部所积存的进口柴油机，因为转速较高又需要轻质柴油为燃料，不便在农村中使用，但可以改装为煤气机，并且减低速度。这样做，马力要减少，售价要调整，但是若能适合农村使用，即时发挥效用，比长期积压在仓库中是有利的。
    我们如能用种种方法，组织机械工业在第一个五年计划期内再增加四十万马力的机械灌溉设备，并且使它发挥最大作用，我们在国民经济方面将会有如下的一些结果：
    四十万马力的灌溉设备，如果用在条件较好的地区，以每马力灌溉五十亩地计（目前有的地区为十亩，有的地区为五十多亩），共可灌溉二千万亩地。二千万亩地若都种粮食，以每亩增产五十斤至一百斤计，每年就可增产十亿斤至二十亿斤，原粮每斤以八分钱计，价值为八千万元至一亿六千万元。若遇灾年，以保田四百万亩，每亩收获三百斤计，也可保产十二亿斤。
    四十万马力的机器设备，约需固定资产投资一亿二千万元。若以每年增产粮食值八千万元至一亿六千万元计，除去每年折旧及管理费约五千万元，每年可增加国家财富三千万元至一亿多元，二、三年内即可把投资收回。
    这样的措施如在第一个五年计划期内证明了它的效果，就可在第二个五年计划中继续每年增加约二千万亩的机械灌溉面积，到第二个五年计划期末我国已可有约一亿二千万亩的机械灌溉的水田，所增产的粮食每年可有一百亿斤。
    制造和使用的问题
    我曾有重点地参观了国内几个专做内燃机的工厂，并且了解了领导这些工厂的专业局的工作情况。我所接触的工厂的生产能力，在国营内燃机工业中占百分之九十。根据我了解到的情况，可以看到我国内燃机制造工业，无论在规模上、技术装备上、工作人数上、技术水平上、管理水平上、生产品种上及生产数量上，都大大的超过了解放以前的水平。目前机械工业领导部门正在着手制定内燃机的系列表，选定标准型式，研究各厂的合理分工，组织各厂解决关键性的技术问题，监督各厂提高产品质量，降低废品率。这些情形都是令人满意的，这都是由于政府领导的正确和工作人员努力的结果。
    但是，目前这些工业也还有一些问题，最突出的就是一方面很多为国家所需要的新型产品生产不了，而另一方面有一部分国营工厂和大部分地方工厂的生产任务少，而生产一般产品的生产能力却很大，又产生吃不饱的现象。在这样的情况下，如果能把这些生产能力组织起来，以多数的地方厂为基础，由少数国营厂为领导，给以制造大量的农田灌溉机器的任务，一方面能使广大农田的灌溉逐步机械化起来，另一方面也可以使这些因“吃不了”新型产品的工厂得以吃饱，充分发挥他们的力量为当前的迫切的农业增产任务服务。
    目前国营厂中比较正常的情况，每人每年平均生产量约为三十五马力。在大量生产的情况下，估计还可提高百分之四十。因此，如能在国营动力机器厂内抽出约一千人的一个厂，在地方厂中组织四千人，共约五千人，则以二十个月的时间可以制造约四十万马力的动力机。另组织一般机械厂的制造力量约二千人制造水泵及附属机械，则可在一九五七年陆续供给农业以四十万马力的灌溉设备。
    有了设备之后还要在短期内组织大批农民来管理和使用这些机器，这个工作也是有困难的，但是困难也是可以克服的。据无锡县的资料，全县三千二百多个管车工中，有百分之九十七是农民。在目前如果能够动员动力机器制造厂和电机制造厂的一些空闲人力下乡，帮助和教会一批农民管理机器，就可以在每一个农事季节中大量地训练出一批新的管车工来，使他们可能在第二年单独管理这些机器。灌溉季节每年不过三、四个月，为抽调人力，在机器厂中可以适当地调整本身的生产任务，以适应农事季节，就能在目前任务不足的工厂中短期地调集约二万工人为农田灌溉的机械化起桥梁作用。当然，这中间包含着很大的组织动员工作，需要工业和农业部门，工会组织和地方党政各方面协同做很多工作。这个行动本身就意味着工农联盟的一个积极措施，对于提高工农群众的政治认识具有实际的意义。
    推广使用小型内燃机的地区，先以在沿江沿湖水网区及圩田区为重点，再及于华北及西南的交通沿线地区，使能发挥较大效果并且减少燃料供应等困难。凡有电力网的地区，应侭量使用电力；在供电量不太充裕的地区，则当地主管机关应在农事季节调节非生产性用电量以供农业之用。江南水网地区可以把内燃机装在船上移动使用；华北等地依赖水井的地区则可用小马力的锅驼机固定使用。
    投资方式，据各地经验以民办公助为最适宜。可以广泛发动农民投资，一般可以先由政府或银行贷款，农民每年按受益田亩摊还资金，到全部归还为止，以后每年只需摊付使用费。这样，既克服了农民在初期缺乏大笔资金的困难，又不至积压国家资金过久。不过对农民的投资负担愈轻则推广的可能性愈大，收得的经济效果也愈多；因此在供应灌溉机械时必须着重降低制造成本。我曾估计，把小型煤气机的售价降低到每马力一百五十元是有可能的。
    结语
    总的看来，一方面机械灌溉在农业增产上有迅速的显著的效果，而目前使用这种机械的还不很广；另一方面，机器制造力量在全国范围内有大批空闲。这中间有脱节现象。为消除这个脱节现象，首先应该由各有关部门会同制定具体计划，调配人力、物力、财力，指定若干工厂把商业部和其他部门所积存的动力灌溉设备进行配合及改装，使在明年度的灌溉季节能发挥效力，同时着手组织在明年度开始利用国营及地方工厂的空闲力量进行制造各种小型灌溉机械。其次则由各有关地区的党政方面发动农民投资使用机器灌溉，发动工人在农事季节下乡直接为农民服务，以保证有了设备之后就能得到应有的增产效果。
    这样一个工作的意义是巨大的，我们应该更多的注意研究这些问题，使得它更具体更切实可行。我们必须尽一切可能，挖掘机械制造工业的潜力，帮助农民弟兄，为保证完成和超额完成农业增产计划而努力。
