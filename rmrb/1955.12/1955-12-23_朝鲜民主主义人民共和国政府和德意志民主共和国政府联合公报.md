Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 22nd: The Joint Communiqué of the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Government of the German Democratic Republic was signed in Pyongyang on the 21st. The signatories to the Joint Communiqué were Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the DPRK, and Otto Grotewohl, Premier of the GDR.

After signing the Joint Communiqué, Premier Kim Il-sung and Premier Grotewohl delivered speeches respectively. They unanimously pointed out that the signing of the Joint Communiqué would strengthen the relations and ties between the two countries and would help consolidate peace in Europe and Asia.

In his speech, Grotewohl also expressed his great honor that Comrade Kim Il-sung, on behalf of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, accepted the invitation to send a government delegation of the DPRK to visit the German Democratic Republic next year.

The full text of the Joint Communiqué is as follows:

At the invitation of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Germany, headed by Comrade Otto Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, paid a friendly visit to Korea from December 18th to 22nd, 1955.

The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic included Dr. Bolz, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs; Dr. Tepelitz, State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice; Florin, Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee of the People's Chamber; Ambassador Grosse, Department Director of the Ministry of Foreigh Affairs; Fischer, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the German Democratic Republic to the DPRK; Jablonski, Secretary of the Central Council of the Free German Trade Union Federation; Dr. Neye, President of Humboldt University of Berlin; Major General Dorlweizer of the Barracked People's Police; Ulf, Director of the "Friendship" Agricultural Production Cooperative and Labor Hero; and Horn, technician and activist of the Dessau Carriage Factory.

Premier Kim Il-sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Premier Otto Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic exchanged views. Present on the Korean side were: Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly; Vice Premier of the Cabinet and Minister of National Defense, Vice Marshal Choi Yong-kun; Park Jung-ae, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea; Vice Premier Hong Myung-hee; Vice Premier Park Chang-ok; Vice Premier Kim Il; Park Kim-chul, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea; Vice Premier Choi Chang-ik; Vice Premier Park Ui-wan; Foreign Minister Nam Il; and Park Kil-yong, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the DPRK to the German Democratic Republic. Present on the German side were members of the government delegation.

During the exchange of views, discussions were held on the issues of further developing the friendly relations between the two countries, guaranteeing collective peace, opposing aggressive military blocs to protect the peoples of Korea and Germany, unifying the motherlands that the peoples of the two countries long for, and other international issues of concern to both countries. The exchange of views was conducted in a friendly atmosphere, and complete agreement was expressed on all issues.

The two governments believe that the continued division of Korea and Germany, due to the vicious plot of the ruling class of the United States to transform South Korea and West Germany into bases of aggression, is the misfortune of the peoples of both countries.

The presence of foreign troops in Korea and Germany is a huge obstacle to the unification of Korea and Germany.

The two governments reiterate that the countries with troops stationed in Korea and Germany must promptly take measures to withdraw all their troops simultaneously from Korea and from Germany.

The unification of Korea and Germany must be realized by the Korean and German peoples themselves on a democratic basis and by peaceful means. To this end, it is necessary to eliminate the distrust and tension existing between North and South Korea and between East and West Germany, and to achieve a gradual mutual approach and consultation on unification between the two sides.

The two governments reiterate that the various proposals they have already elucidated in this regard remain valid.

The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement has made an important contribution to maintaining peace in Asia and has become a necessary prerequisite for the peaceful unification of Korea. In order to transform the Korean armistice state into a consolidated peace, both parties must strictly abide by the armistice agreement.

Therefore, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission composed of representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland must continue to exist, and all plots attempting to obstruct its performance of its duties and attempting to disband it must be eliminated.

The two governments believe that in order to resolve the Korean issue in accordance with the interests of the Korean people and the interests of peace, it is necessary to convene an international conference attended by countries related to the Korean issue as quickly as possible.

The United States' policy of rearming West Germany drags the German people and the peoples of Europe and the world into the danger of a new war. Therefore, the struggle against the rearmament of West Germany is a sacred common duty of all peace-loving people.

The two governments believe that it is necessary to establish a European collective security system, smash military blocs, and eliminate the rule of monopoly capitalists and landlords in West Germany, in order to pave the way for the peaceful reunification of Germany on a democratic basis.

No force can continue to prevent Korea and Germany from reunifying into peace-loving, democratic, and independent countries.

The two governments solemnly stated their unwavering will: to safeguard the national self-determination rights of the two peoples from infringement, to reject all conspiracies attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of the two countries, and to establish relations, regardless of the national and social systems of the countries, with all other countries on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit.

The two governments noted with satisfaction that the friendly relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the German Democratic Republic are constantly expanding and strengthening, which is in line with the interests of the peoples of the two countries and helps consolidate world peace.

The two governments have reached an agreement: in order to further strengthen this friendly relationship, all necessary measures will be taken in the economic, cultural, and other fields.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expresses its sincere gratitude to the German people for the material and spiritual assistance given to the Korean people in the struggle for post-war economic recovery and construction, together with the people of the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic stated that the German Democratic Republic is prepared to continue to provide the Korean people with this assistance in the future.

The two governments believe that the visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea and the exchange of views will help strengthen the friendship and unity between the peoples of the two countries, and ensure the security of the peoples of all countries and consolidate peace in Asia and Europe.

    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府联合公报
    新华社平壤二十二日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府联合公报二十一日在平壤签字。双方在联合公报上签字的是：朝鲜内阁首相金日成元帅和德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥。
    金日成首相和格罗提渥总理在联合公报上签字后，分别发表演说。他们一致指出，联合公报的签署将加强两国的关系和联系，并且将有助于巩固欧洲和亚洲的和平。
    格罗提渥在演说中还表示，对于金日成同志以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的名义接受邀请，在明年派遣朝鲜政府代表团访问德意志民主共和国一事，感到莫大的荣幸。
    联合公报全文如下：
    以德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥同志为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的邀请，自一九五五年十二月十八日到二十二日在朝鲜作了友好访问。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团包括副总理兼外交部长博尔茨博士，司法部国务秘书特普利茨博士，人民议院外交政策委员会主席弗洛林，外交部部务委员格罗塞大使，德意志民主共和国驻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国特命全权大使费希尔，自由德国工会联合会中央理事会书记处书记雅布朗斯基，柏林洪堡大学校长奈耶博士，驻营人民警察少将多尔维策尔，“友谊”农业生产合作社主任、劳动英雄乌尔夫，德绍车厢制造厂技师、积极分子霍恩。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国金日成首相和德意志民主共和国奥托·格罗提渥总理互相交换了意见，朝鲜方面在座的有：最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉、内阁副首相兼民族保卫相崔庸健次帅、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、副首相洪命熹、副首相朴昌玉、副首相金一、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴金喆、副首相崔昌益、副首相朴义琓、外务相南日、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻德意志民主共和国特命全权大使朴吉龙；德国方面在座的有：政府代表团成员们。
    在交换意见中，讨论了关于进一步发展两国间的友谊关系的问题和保障集体和平问题、关于反对侵略性的军事集团以保护朝德两国人民的问题、关于两国人民所渴望的自己祖国统一的问题以及两国所关心的其他国际问题。交换意见是在友好的空气中进行的，并且对一切问题表明了完全一致的意见。
    两国政府认为，由于美国统治阶级企图把南朝鲜和西德转变为侵略基地的恶毒策划，朝鲜和德国继续陷于分裂，这是两国人民的不幸。
    外国军队驻留在朝鲜和德国境内，是对朝鲜和德国统一的巨大障碍。
    两国政府重新强调，在朝鲜和德国驻有军队的各国必须迅速采取措施，由朝鲜境内同时撤出一切自己的军队，并且由德国境内同时撤出一切自己的军队。
    朝鲜统一和德国统一，必须交由朝鲜人民和德国人民自己在民主基础上以和平方法来实现。为此，有必要消除分别存在于南北朝鲜之间和东西德之间的不信任和紧张局势，并且实现为争取双方之间逐渐的相互接近和关于统一的协商。
    两国政府重申：他们已经阐明的关于这方面的各项建议是继续有效的。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订，对维护亚洲和平作出了重要的贡献，并且成为和平统一朝鲜所必要的前提。为了将朝鲜停战状态转为巩固的和平，缔约双方必须严格遵守停战协定。
    因此，由波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典和瑞士代表组成的中立国监察委员会必须继续存在下去，并且必须排除企图阻挠它执行任务和企图解散它的一切策划。
    两国政府认为：为了符合朝鲜人民利益和和平利益以解决朝鲜问题，有必要尽可能地迅速召开与朝鲜问题有关的国家参加的国际会议。
    美国重新武装西德的政策把德国人民和欧洲及全世界人民拖入新战争的危险中。所以，反对重新武装西德的斗争，是全体爱好和平人民的神圣的共同义务。
    两国政府认为，有必要建立欧洲集体安全体系，粉碎军事集团，在西德排除垄断资本家和地主的统治，以铺平在民主基础上重新和平统一德国的道路。
    任何力量也不能继续阻挠朝鲜和德国重新统一成为一个爱好和平的民主独立的国家。
    两国政府严肃地表明了它们的坚定不移的意志：维护两国人民的民族自决权使其不受侵害，排斥企图干涉两国内政的一切阴谋，不问各国的国家和社会制度如何，以互相尊重主权、不干涉内政、平等互利的原则为基础，同所有其他国家建立关系。
    两国政府满意地指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的友谊关系正在不断扩大和加强，它符合于两国人民的利益，并且有助于巩固世界和平。
    两国政府达成协议：为了进一步加强这种友谊关系，将在经济、文化以及其他部门采取一切必要的措施。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对于德国人民同以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的各兄弟国家人民一起，在朝鲜人民为战后人民经济恢复建设斗争方面所给予的物质上和精神上的援助，表示真诚的感谢。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团表明：德意志民主共和国准备在今后仍将继续给予朝鲜人民以这种援助。
    两国政府确信，德意志民主共和国政府代表团的访问朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和进行的意见交换，将有助于两国人民之间的友谊团结的加强，以及保障各国人民的安全和巩固亚洲和欧洲的和平。
