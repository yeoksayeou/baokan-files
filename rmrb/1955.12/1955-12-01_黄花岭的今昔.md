　　In autumn, Huanghualing Township, in front of Mount Culai in Cuyang County, Shandong Province, appears exceptionally beautiful. The mountains surrounding the villages are covered with dense small trees; flocks of sheep graze in the pastures; in the farmlands, the cooperative's sturdy oxen pull double-wheeled, double-furrow plows, turning the autumn fields. People say: in this mountain village, people have turned over a new leaf, the land has turned over a new leaf, and even the barren mountains are beginning to turn over a new leaf.

　　The former Huanghualing Township was a completely different picture. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the ravages and destruction by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the forests in this area were completely cut down, the cattle and sheep were slaughtered, and the fields lay barren. Whenever the rainy season arrived, mountain torrents cascaded down the bare mountains like waterfalls, destroying farmland and carrying away crops. In 1947 alone, more than forty mu of farmland were turned into riverbeds. At that time, 314 households in the township were perpetually begging for food, and some farmers fled to other places.

　　After liberation, the Party and the government called on the people in mountainous areas to vigorously close off mountains for afforestation and conserve water and soil. Huanghualing Township was the first to respond to this call. In the winter of 1949, the township's Communist Party branch led 43 households to establish a mountain closure and afforestation cooperative. At that time, some cooperative members said: Closing off the mountains is a good thing, but there are too many difficulties, and it's impossible to do. Some cooperative members said: Closing off public mountains to plant public forests, we won't get our own share in the future. The branch repeatedly educated everyone, explaining that the forests collectively managed by the working people would definitely be protected by the government. That year, they adopted a method of semi-closure and semi-protection. Of the township's more than 10,000 mu of barren mountains, half was closed off first, and the remaining half only allowed people to go up the mountain to cut grass, but not to dig up grass roots. In the year when the mountains were closed off, the grass and trees were lush, while the unsealed mountains were still bare, forming a significant contrast, which gave the cooperative members a great education. In the spring of 1951, another 23 households of farmers requested to join the cooperative. In 1953, five agricultural and forestry cooperatives were established in the township. In 1955, the original five old cooperatives were expanded, and two new cooperatives were established. A total of 462 households in the township joined the cooperatives, accounting for 85 percent of the total number of households in the township.

　　In the past five years, the township has relied on cooperatives to afforest a total of 5,250 mu, and cultivated more than 1.2 million various trees, including 235,000 fruit and nut trees. The peaches and apricots planted in 1950 began to bear fruit in the spring of this year, with 16,000 trees producing a total of 27,900 jin of fruit, which was exchanged for nearly 20,000 jin of grain.

　　Because the cooperative seriously implemented the rules for closing off mountains for forest cultivation, weeds grew everywhere in the deep mountains and steep ravines. More than 970,000 jin of pasture grass and firewood were harvested this winter, completely solving the problem of the shortage of pasture and fuel. As a result of closing off mountains for afforestation and conserving water sources, the small river that had dried up for more than ten years in 1953 was restored to flow. More than 350 mu of farmland irrigated by river water this spring have now achieved bumper harvests, with the township's average yield reaching 171 jin per mu, an increase of 91 jin compared to 1949. Now, the township has 316 cattle, an increase of 291 compared to 1949; 450 pigs, an increase of 442 compared to 1949; and where there wasn't a single sheep in the past, now there are 200 large, fat sheep.

　　In the past, many farmers ate government relief grain every year, but this year the township also sold more than 20,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Since 1952, more than 370 new houses have been built in the township. In the four elementary schools, 270 children are studying. The impoverished face of Huanghualing Township is gone forever.

    黄花岭的今昔
    栋之
    秋天，山东省徂阳县徂徕山前的黄花岭乡，显得十分美丽。村庄周围的山上，长着稠密的小树；牧场上群羊在吃草；农田里，合作社的肥牛拖着双轮双铧犁在翻耕秋田。人们都说：在这个山村里，人翻身，田翻身，荒山也开始翻身了。
    从前的黄花岭乡，可完全是另一个样子。抗日战争期间，由于日寇和蒋匪军的蹂躏破坏，这一带的山林砍光了，牛羊杀光了，田园荒芜了。每逢雨季到来，山洪像瀑布一样，由童山秃岭上倾泻下来，冲毁了农田，卷走了庄稼。一九四七年就有四十多亩农田变成了河道。当时全乡有三百一十四户常年讨饭，有些农民逃荒到他乡去了。
    解放后，党和政府号召山区人民大力封山造林，保持水土，黄花岭乡首先响应了这一号召。一九四九年冬，中共乡支部领导四十三户成立了封山造林合作社。当时有的社员说：封山是好事，就是困难太多，没法封。有的社员说：封公山造公林，将来没有自己的份。支部反复地向大家进行了教育，说明劳动人民集体经营起来的山林，一定会受到政府的保护。这一年，他们采取了半封山半护山的办法。全乡有一万多亩荒山，先封一半，其余一半只准大家上山割草，不许刨草根。当年封的山草木丰茂，未封的山还是光秃秃的，形成了显著的对比，这给了社员很大的教育。一九五一年春，又有二十三户农民要求入社。一九五三年，全乡成立了五个农林合作社，一九五五年，原有的五个老社扩大了，又有两个新社建立起来。全乡入社的有四百六十二户，占全乡总户数的百分之八十五。
    五年来，全乡依靠合作社共造林五千二百五十亩，培育了各种林木一百二十多万株，其中干果、水果就有二十三万五千株。一九五○年栽培的桃杏，今年春天有一万六千株开始结果，全乡收入果品两万七千九百斤，换了近两万斤粮食。
    由于合作社认真地执行了封山育林的规则，深山陡涧中，到处杂草丛生。今冬收割的牧草和烧柴有九十七万多斤，全部解决了牧草和燃料缺乏的问题。由于封山造林、涵养水源的结果，在一九五三年干涸了十多年的小河恢复了水流。今年春天利用河水灌溉的三百五十多亩农田，现在都获得了丰收，全乡每亩平均产量达到一百七十一斤，比一九四九年提高了九十一斤。现在，全乡有牛三百一十六头，比一九四九年增加了二百九十一头；有猪四百五十口，比一九四九年增加四百四十二口；过去一只羊没有，现在有了肥大的绵羊二百只。
    过去许多农民年年吃政府的救济粮，今年全乡还卖了两万多斤余粮给国家。一九五二年以来，全乡盖了新屋三百七十多间。在四处小学里，二百七十名儿童在学习。黄花岭乡的贫困面貌，一去不复返了。
