Do not forcibly pull in nor reject

Recently, in Yongle Township, Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province, there are three different situations among the well-to-do middle peasants who have joined the cooperative. One is that they have less land and more labor, and their income can be increased after joining the cooperative; these well-to-do middle peasants are wholeheartedly willing to join. The second is that they have more land and just enough labor, and their income after joining the cooperative is roughly the same as working individually; these well-to-do middle peasants are still somewhat hesitant after joining the cooperative. The third is that they have a lot of land and little labor, and their income will be temporarily reduced after joining the cooperative compared to working individually; these well-to-do middle peasants, although they don't want to join in their hearts, still want to join because they don't want to be mixed up with landlords and rich peasants.

It can be seen from this that the attitude of well-to-do middle peasants towards agricultural cooperatives also varies depending on the specific circumstances. However, some cooperative construction workers in some areas have two biases in dealing with the issue of absorbing well-to-do middle peasants into the cooperatives: one is to forcibly pull them in, and the other is to refuse to absorb them. Facts have proved that both of these practices are inappropriate. We cannot use one yardstick to measure well-to-do middle peasants, but should, according to the actual situation, truly understand whether their joining the cooperative is truly voluntary, and then carefully and separately solve their joining problem.

    不要强拉也不要拒绝
    浙江省永嘉县永乐乡最近入社的富裕中农中有三种不同的情况。一种是土地较少，劳力较多，入社以后能增加收入；这类富裕中农一心一意要入社。另一种是土地较多，劳力勉强够用，入社以后收入和单干大体相等；这类富裕中农入了社思想还有些摇摆不定。再一种是土地多，劳力少，入社以后比单干暂时还要减少一些收入；这类富裕中农虽然本心不想入社，可是因为不愿和地主富农混到一起去又要入社。
    从这里可以看出，富裕中农对农业合作社的态度，也因各种不同的具体情况而有所不同。但是，有些地区的建社工作人员，在对待吸收富裕中农入社的问题上，有两种偏向：一种是强拉入社，一种是拒绝吸收。事实证明，这两种做法都是不妥当的。我们不能用一条尺子来衡量富裕中农，而应该根据实际情况，切实了解他们入社是不是真正自愿，然后慎重地有分别地解决他们的入社问题。
