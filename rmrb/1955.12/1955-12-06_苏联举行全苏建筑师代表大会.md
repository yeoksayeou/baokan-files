Xinhua News Agency, citing TASS, reported that the Second All-Union Congress of Architects was held in Moscow from November 26th to December 2nd.

During the meeting, approximately 700 delegates discussed the major issues in Soviet architecture and the urgent tasks for architects and construction workers outlined in the resolution "On Eliminating Waste in Design and Construction" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on November 9th. They reviewed the achievements and shortcomings of Soviet architects, and studied the organization of construction, industrialized construction methods, standard designs, personnel training, and the creative use of ancient architectural heritage. The conference paid close attention to the further development of industrial, residential, and cultural facilities construction.

At the end of the congress, a resolution was unanimously adopted, warmly endorsing the resolution "On Eliminating Waste in Design and Construction" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. The resolution stated that these instructions from the Party and the government should become the program of action for all architects, design and construction organizations, and architectural associations.

The congress also unanimously adopted the new charter of the Soviet Architects Association, and elected a new council and auditing committee for the association.

In addition to the official delegates, more than 1,800 guests attended the meeting, including representatives from China and other People's Democratic countries.

Soviet Party and government leaders Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Saburov, Suslov, Aristov, Pospelov, and others attended the opening session. Aristov also read out the congratulatory message from the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers to the Congress at the opening session.

During the meeting, the congress received many letters from working people all over the Soviet Union, which put forward many important criticisms and valuable suggestions for improving construction work. The congress instructed the newly elected council of the Architects Association to carefully study these materials and draft measures to thoroughly improve the work of the association.

Simultaneous with the congress, large-scale architectural exhibitions were held at the Trade Union Building and the Central House of Architects in Moscow.
