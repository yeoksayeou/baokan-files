    Why Must He Ride a Small Jeep?
    To the Editor:
    Zhang Danqing, the Party Secretary of the Shizuizi Copper Mine under the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, went to Changchun for meetings twice before National Day and at the end of October. Both times, he demanded that the mine send him there specifically in a small Jeep. The transportation from Shizuizi Copper Mine to Changchun is very convenient. It only takes a little over a day by train, and the fare would not cost more than a few yuan. The small Jeep travels 800 li round trip. How much gasoline does that use! Secretary Zhang calls on the workers in the mine to "practice strict economy," but why does he waste state funds at will for the sake of "ostentation?"

    为什么非乘小吉普不可编辑同志：
    重工业部有色金属工业管理局所属石咀子铜矿的党委书记张丹卿，在国庆节前和十月末两次到长春开会，都要矿里用小吉普车专门送他去。从石咀子铜矿到长春的交通非常方便，坐火车时间只要一天多，车费也花不了几元钱。小吉普车往返一次八百里，要用多少汽油啊！张书记在矿里号召职工要“厉行节约”，为什么自己为了“排场”就随便浪费国家资金呢？
