Welcoming the Glorious Representatives of the German Democratic Republic
By Our Staff Reporter

On the afternoon of December 8th, Beijing Airport was bathed in the warm sun of early winter. Nearly ten thousand people waited at the airport. Among them were ministers and generals of the People's Republic of China, workers, students, cadres, and citizens of Beijing, representatives of various countries' embassies in China, comrades from the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, experts from the German Democratic Republic who have come to our country to help us with our construction, and students from the German Democratic Republic studying in China. They waited, waiting for the distinguished guests and friends flying from the other end of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp.

Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at the airport, shaking hands with the representatives of various countries' embassies. He walked to a group of German children, who, wearing blue scarves, cheered for Premier Zhou Enlai. Premier Zhou picked up a little girl with golden hair, who affectionately pressed her small hand to the Premier's face. Her gaze seemed to be saying to the Premier: "Today, I also know why so many people are waiting here, why there are so many beautiful flowers."

At exactly 3:00 PM, a silver airplane appeared in the sky above Beijing. The eyes of nearly ten thousand people watched, no, the eyes of six hundred million people watched as it circled and descended. Salute! Silver Eagle. You have brought boundless beautiful friendship from a distant fraternal country. Although geographically distant, we are very familiar with this fraternal country, the Germany that gave birth to the father of the world's proletariat, the founders of scientific communism, Marx and Engels; the Germany that gave birth to Liebknecht, Luxemburg, and Thälmann; the Germany that also gave birth to Schiller, Goethe, Heine, and Beethoven; the first workers' and peasants', peace-loving Germany to appear in European history; the Germany that has given us fraternal support in the socialist construction of the Chinese people. Such a Germany has now sent a glorious delegation headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl.

People's hearts were stirred, and young girls waved jasmine and magnolia flowers in their hands, the flowers emitting a fragrant aroma. As the plane landed, the roar of the propellers was drowned out by thunderous cheers of "Long Live Sino-German Friendship!" "Long Live Peace!" Prime Minister Grotewohl, his wife, and other members of the delegation appeared in order at the cabin door, waving to the welcoming crowd. Premier Zhou Enlai stepped forward, and the hands of the Prime Ministers of China and Germany were clasped tightly together. The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic was holding the hand of the six hundred million Chinese people on the Asian continent who are defending world peace; our Premier was holding the hand of all the German people on the European continent who are defending world peace.

Next, Prime Minister Grotewohl, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the guard of honor. Before Prime Minister Grotewohl stood the mighty warriors of the Chinese people, who paid their respects to the distinguished guests, their eyes shining with the light of the Chinese people's victory; such warriors are today joining hands with the German people in the noble cause of defending peace.

After the review, twelve girls ran to the glorious representatives of the German people. They presented bouquets of beautiful magnolia, jasmine, and chrysanthemum flowers to the distinguished guests. Qiu Xueke, a female student from Beijing Medical College, presented flowers to Prime Minister Grotewohl and leaned happily beside him. Prime Minister Grotewohl stroked her head like a father and said, "I hope you will become a very good doctor in the future."

As Prime Minister Grotewohl walked towards the ranks of the masses, thunderous cheers once again reverberated through the airport. Prime Minister Grotewohl stopped from time to time to say to the welcoming crowd in Chinese: "Hello, hello!" "Friendship, friendship!" Prime Minister Grotewohl also paid special tribute to the young people, shouting enthusiastically to them: "Long live the youth!"

In the long line of welcomers, enthusiastic and beautiful girls kept running out to present flowers to Prime Minister Grotewohl. Each bouquet of flowers represented the Chinese people's respect and friendship. From the ranks of the workers, Zhao Xiuqin, a young female worker from the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill, ran towards Prime Minister Grotewohl, presenting him with flowers like the other girls. In the factory where Zhao Xiuqin works, there are spinning machines from the German Democratic Republic, and Zhao Xiuqin herself operates the machines made by the German worker brothers. When Prime Minister Grotewohl learned of all this, he asked with concern: "Are the German machines easy to use?" Zhao Xiuqin replied: "Everything is easy to use." The young female worker cast a grateful glance at Prime Minister Grotewohl.

Finally, Prime Minister Grotewohl walked towards the German citizens and children who were welcoming him, who presented flowers and cheered for their beloved Prime Minister.

Prime Minister Grotewohl, his wife, and the comrades of the delegation walked through the long, jubilant crowd. Amidst the cheers of "Long Live Sino-German Friendship!" Prime Minister Grotewohl stepped up to the microphone and, on behalf of all the German people, paid tribute to our great capital—Beijing, and conveyed the friendship of all the German people to the Chinese people.

    欢迎光荣的民主德国的代表
    本报记者
    十二月八日下午，北京机场沐浴在初冬暖人的阳光里。将近一万人等候在机场上。这里有中华人民共和国政府的部长们、将军们，有北京市的工人、学生、干部和市民们，有各国的驻华使馆代表，有德意志民主共和国的驻华使馆的同志们，有来我国帮助我们建设的民主德国的专家们和民主德国在华的留学生。他们等候着，等候着从和平民主社会主义阵营的另一头飞来的贵宾和友人。
    周恩来总理到了机场，他分别和各国使馆的代表握手。他走到一群德国孩子跟前，那些结着蓝领巾的德国孩子们向周恩来总理欢呼。周总理抱起一个金黄色头发的小女孩，那个女孩把小手亲切地紧贴在总理的脸上。她的目光似乎是向总理说：“今天，我也知道，为什么这么多人在这里等候，为什么这里有那么多好看的花儿。”
    三时正，一架银色的飞机出现在北京的上空。近一万人的眼睛注视着，不，六万万人的眼睛注视着它盘旋着下降。敬礼！银色的鹰。您从一个遥远的兄弟之国带来了无限美好的友谊。虽然是在地理上相距遥远，我们却非常熟悉这个兄弟国家，它是诞生了全世界无产阶级的父亲、科学共产主义的创始人马克思和恩格斯的德国；诞生了李卜克内西、卢森堡和台尔曼的德国；也是诞生了席勒、歌德、海涅和贝多芬的德国；是欧洲历史上第一次出现的工人和农民的、爱好和平的德国；是在中国人民社会主义建设事业中给了我们以兄弟般的支援的德国。这样的德国现在派来了以格罗提渥总理为首的光荣的代表团。
    人们的心激动起来，少女们挥动着手上的茉莉花和玉兰花，花儿散发着阵阵的芳香。当飞机着陆时，推进机的巨响被雷动似的“中德友好万岁！”“和平万岁！”的欢呼声淹没了。格罗提渥总理和他的夫人及代表团其他人员顺序出现在机舱门首，向欢迎的人群挥手致意。周恩来总理迎上前去，中德两国总理的手紧紧地握在一起了。民主德国总理握着的是在亚洲大陆上捍卫着世界和平的六亿中国人民的手；我国总理握着的是在欧洲大陆上捍卫着世界和平的全体德国人民的手。
    接着，格罗提渥总理在周恩来总理的陪同下检阅仪仗队。在格罗提渥总理面前的是中国人民的威武的战士，他们向贵宾行注目礼，他们的眼睛里闪耀着中国人民的胜利的光辉；这样的战士今天是在保卫和平的崇高事业中同德国人民携手前进的。
    检阅毕，十二个女孩子奔向德国人民的光荣的代表们。她们把一束一束美丽的玉兰花、茉莉花和菊花献给贵宾们。北京医学院的女学生邱雪珂把鲜花献给格罗提渥总理，并且幸福地偎依在他的身旁。格罗提渥总理像父亲似地抚着她的头说：“希望你将来成为一个很好的医生。”
    当格罗提渥总理走向群众的行列，雷动的欢呼声重又响彻机场。格罗提渥总理不时地停下来用中国话向欢迎的人群说：“你好，你好！”“友好，友好！”格罗提渥总理还特别向青年群众致意，并且热情地向他们喊着：“青年万岁！”
    在长长的欢迎者的行列里，不断奔出来热情美丽的女孩子，向格罗提渥总理献花。每一束鲜花都代表着中国人民的敬意和友情。从工人的行列中，国营北京第一棉纺织厂的青年女工赵秀琴向格罗提渥总理奔来了，同其他女孩子一样把鲜花献给了他。在赵秀琴工作着的厂里，有着民主德国的纺纱机，赵秀琴自己就操作着德国工人兄弟制造出来的机器。当格罗提渥总理知道了这一切，他就关心地问道：“德国的机器好使吗？”赵秀琴回答说：“一切都是好使的。”这个青年女工向格罗提渥总理投出了感激的目光。
    最后，格罗提渥总理走向欢迎着他的德国的公民们和孩子们，他们向他们敬爱的总理献花和欢呼。
    格罗提渥总理和他的夫人和代表团的同志们走过了长长的欢腾的群众行列。格罗提渥总理在“中德友好万岁”的欢呼声中走到扩音机前，他代表全体德国人民向我们伟大的首都——北京致敬，向中国人民转达全体德国人民的友谊。
