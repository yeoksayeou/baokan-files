Letters from Families of Chinese Students in the U.S.

Editor's Note: Due to various obstructions by the U.S. government authorities, Chinese students in the U.S. cannot freely return to their motherland. Even after the first item on the agenda of the Sino-U.S. talks reached an agreement, this situation has not changed. The families of students in the U.S. in China often write to relevant departments in our country, expressing their indignation at the U.S. government's illegal deprivation of the legitimate rights of Chinese nationals and its inhumane behavior. We now publish excerpts from their letters.

I.

From the newspapers, we saw the news that a group of students studying in the U.S. had returned to the motherland, which made us very happy, because they finally broke free from the obstacles of the U.S. Immigration Bureau and reunited with their families in the motherland. However, we also feel very anxious, because our whole family is looking forward to the return of my son, Shen Fachun, but not only is Fachun unable to return, but he has been out of contact since he planned to return to China.

Fachun went to the United States to study in March 1948, first studying at the University of California, and later transferred to the University of Chicago. After the national liberation, our family all hoped that he would return to the country to work as soon as possible. In his letters, he also expressed that it was "better to return home early" and that he "hoped to return to the motherland as soon as possible to contribute." In the spring of 1952, he decided to return home in the summer. After we learned of his decision, we immediately prepared to welcome him. But since then, there has been no news, and letters sent to him have not been answered. Recently, after reading about the despicable tricks of the U.S. Immigration Bureau in the newspaper, I wonder if he has also encountered shameful obstruction.

Now our whole family is very anxious, so we sincerely request the government to resolutely fight for the freedom of Chinese students in the U.S. to return home at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial meeting, so that our relatives can return home and reunite with their families as soon as possible.

My son Feng Yuanzhen and daughter-in-law Yu Xianshi went to the United States to study in 1945 and 1947 respectively. Yuanzhen studied aeronautical power and is now teaching at the California Institute of Technology. After the national liberation, they always wanted to return to the motherland. In 1951, when Mr. Qian Xuesen returned to China, my son wrote that he was preparing to return with him. However, Mr. Qian Xuesen was obstructed by the U.S. government on his way back to China, so they were unable to return. My son wrote that this was due to the obstruction of the U.S. government, especially the obstruction of Chinese students studying science and engineering from returning home. The U.S. government even threatened those who applied to return home with a five-year prison sentence and a fine of two thousand U.S. dollars. Under these circumstances, in 1952, they wanted to return via the Netherlands, but they were unsuccessful because they could not obtain an exit permit from the U.S. government.

Due to the obstruction of the U.S. government, I and my son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren have not been able to meet for a long time. Now I am 61 years old, and how much I miss them! Why doesn't the U.S. government let them return? I implore the government to help them return to China so that our family can be reunited.

Our son Gao Hongye went to the United States in 1945. He first studied economics at the University of Colorado, then majored in accounting, and finally majored in statistics. In 1952, he left school and worked as a cost control engineer at a construction company in San Francisco. At that time, he tried to return to China, but did not achieve his goal. In 1953, he entered the University of California to major in statistics, preparing to return to China in 1954, but he was unsuccessful again. In December 1954, he wrote firmly that he would return to the embrace of the motherland in 1955 no matter what.

Unexpectedly, since January 1955, although we have been writing letters every month, we have never received a reply from him, while he used to write letters every month. In his repeated letters, our son expressed his love for the new China and his ambition to build the motherland, and he is not a person who does not want his parents. However, the long absence of letters cannot but arouse our suspicion. Is it because he wanted to return to China that he was persecuted? We saw that before our government discussed the issue of civilians returning to their countries at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial meeting, even American criminals serving sentences in our country were released early, but our innocent children were not allowed to return, which cannot but make us want to protest to the U.S. government.

Yang Zhi is now teaching at Shandong Agricultural College. We are both over sixty years old. Seeing that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the international status of the new China is increasing day by day, and the Chinese people have become masters of their own affairs, how we are looking forward to our son's return to serve the motherland every day. But until today, not only can we not see our son, but we don't even have his letters. We are really anxious and uneasy. We demand that the U.S. authorities immediately restore his freedom of communication and let him return home.

IV.

My name is Liu Jingyu, and I am 61 years old. I only have one son, Liu Anhua, who graduated from the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Southwest Associated University. He went to the United States to study in early 1944, specializing in paint. After graduating from the University of Michigan, he worked in a paint factory near the school. He also married Ling Han, a female student from Hangzhou. After marriage, they moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and worked in another paint factory there, and had a son and a daughter.

After the national liberation, Anhua and Ling Han applied to return to China, and the U.S. government approved it. However, after they boarded a ship in San Francisco in 1951, they were blocked by the U.S. government when they sailed to Honolulu on the grounds that Chinese students studying science and engineering were not allowed to leave the United States, and they were forcibly detained. After being blocked back, Anhua has been working in a paint factory in Baltimore, Maryland, on the East Coast of the United States. Ling Han has also recently been participating in drug research at the University of Maryland. In the past few years, there have still been letters exchanged from time to time. In his letters, Anhua has always expressed his urgent desire to return to China.

Unfortunately, I suffered a stroke in 1953. Although I have escaped danger recently, I still have hemiplegia. Because my lover has passed away and I have no other children, I am even more eager for Anhua to return to China as soon as possible.

Now that the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial meeting is being held in Geneva, I earnestly hope that the government will, through the ambassadorial meeting, specifically request the U.S. government to allow Liu Anhua, Ling Han, and their children to return to China as soon as possible.

V.

I am the mother of two children. The children's father, Hu Shengen, passed the public-funded study abroad examination in the United States in 1945. At first, he studied chemical industry at the University of Minnesota in Chicago. In the second half of 1949, he transferred to the Graduate School of the University of Michigan in Chicago. He received his Ph.D. in June 1953. During the above years of study, he repeatedly tried to return to China between 1951 and 1952. Unexpectedly, the U.S. government used the excuse that he did not have enough academic credits and did not allow him to leave the country, and even forcibly withheld his residence permit, which made my husband's desire to return to the country to serve and reunite with his family impossible to realize. In this way, my lover had no choice but to work in a gasoline research institute in the United States.

I often write to him, introducing him to the thriving atmosphere of the motherland. And I encouraged him to strive to return to the country as soon as possible. Finally, I received a reply from him saying: "Regarding the issue of returning to the country, I know that I will work hard to strive for it. I hope that I don't have to talk about this issue in the future..." After receiving his letter, I was very worried, whether it was because I often urged him to return to the country that it was detrimental to him? When the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks on the issue of civilians being able to return to their countries just began, I wrote him a letter, advising him to find a way to return as soon as possible. In early July, I received a very ordinary family letter from him, only talking about some family matters. It has been more than two months today, and I have not received any news from him. Under this circumstance, I am very anxious and worried about his safety.

It is a matter of course to see one's relatives, and no one is allowed to interfere or obstruct it. My two children are already studying in junior high school. They are looking forward to their father's return day and night. In order to cultivate our children, for the happiness of the family, and to allow my lover to contribute what he has learned to the motherland, I am determined to ask the U.S. government to return my relatives.

### 我国留美学生家属的来信

    我国留美学生家属的来信
    编者按：我国留美学生由于美国政府当局的种种阻挠，不能自由返回祖国。即使在中美会谈第一项议程达成协议以后，这种情况仍然没有改变。留美学生在国内的家属，常常写信给我国有关方面，对于美国政府这种非法剥夺中国侨民正当权益和违反人道的行为，表示愤慨。现将他们的来信，摘要发表。一
    从报上我们看到了一批留美学生回到祖国的消息，使我们感到非常高兴，因为他们终于从美国移民局的阻难中挣脱出来，返回祖国和家庭团聚了。可是，我们也感到非常焦虑，因为我们一家人都在盼望着我的儿子沈法淳的归来，但是法淳不但不能归来，而且从他打算归国以后，就音信杳然了。
    法淳是一九四八年三月赴美留学的，先在加利福尼亚大学念书，后来转入芝加哥大学。全国解放后我们一家人都盼望他早日回国参加工作，他自己来信也表示“不如早还乡”，“希望早日回到祖国尽一分力量”。一九五二年春他决定夏天归国。我们知道他的决定后就立即筹备欢迎他。可是自那时以后，就断绝音信，去了信也无回信。最近从报上看到美国移民局的卑鄙技俩，不知他是否也遭遇了可耻的阻挠。
    现在我们一家人都很焦虑，因此我们衷心的恳请政府在中美大使级会议上坚决争取留美学生的归国自由，使我们的亲人能够早日归国与家人团聚。
                  法淳的母亲萧纯淑自汉口二
    我的儿子冯元桢、儿媳俞娴士分别在一九四五年和一九四七年到美国留学。元桢学的是航空动力，现在在加利福尼亚理工学院教书。全国解放以后，他们就一直想回到祖国来。一九五一年钱学森先生回国的时候，我儿子来信说他准备跟着回来。但钱学森先生在回国途中受到了美国政府的阻挠，他们也就没有能够回来。我的儿子来信说，这是由于美国政府阻挠，特别是阻挠学习理工科的中国留学生回国的缘故。美国政府并且用判处五年徒刑和罚款两千美元的办法来威胁申请回国的人。就在这种情况下，一九五二年，他们想从荷兰绕道回来，也因为取不到美国政府的出境证而没有成功。
    由于美国政府的阻挠，使我和我的儿子、儿媳以及两个孙儿长期不能见面，现在我已是六十一岁的人了，我是多么想念他们啊！为什么美国政府不让他们回来呢？我恳求政府帮助他们回国，以使我们骨肉得以团聚。
                  冯元桢的母亲胡琏自江苏三
    我们的儿子高鸿业在一九四五年去美国。先在柯罗拉多大学学经济，后来专修会计，最后专修统计。一九五二年离校到旧金山一家建筑公司当成本控制工程师。当时他便设法回国，但没有达到目的。一九五三年入加利福尼亚大学专修统计，准备在一九五四年回国，但又没有成功。一九五四年十二月他来信坚决地说，无论如何要在一九五五年回到祖国的怀抱。
    不料自一九五五年一月起，虽然我们按月去信，但总得不到他的回信，而他过去是按月来信的。我们的儿子在屡次来信中表示他对新中国的热爱和建设祖国的抱负，也不是不要父母的人。但长期没有来信，不能不引起我们的怀疑，是不是因为他要回国，遭到迫害了呢？我们看见我国政府在中美大使级会议讨论双方平民回国问题以前，连在我国服刑的美国罪犯都提前释放了，而我们无罪的孩子却不得回来，这不能不使我们要对美国政府提出抗议。
    仰支现在山东农学院教书，我们两人现在都已年逾六十。眼看着在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，新中国的国际地位日益提高，中国人民已经当家作主，我们是如何在天天巴望着自己的儿子回来为祖国服务。但直到今天不但见不到我们的儿子，连他的信也没有。我们实在焦灼和不安。我们要求美国当局立即恢复他的通信自由并让他回国。

    我名刘靖宇，现年六十一岁。我只有一个儿子刘安华，原在西南联大化学工程系毕业，一九四四年初去美留学，专研油漆。在密执安大学毕业后，即在学校附近一家油漆厂工作。并且和杭州女留学生凌寒结婚。婚后迁居明尼苏达州明列波黎城，在该地另一油漆厂工作，生有一子一女。
    全国解放之后，安华与凌寒申请返国，美国政府批准。但他们在一九五一年从旧金山上船后，航行到檀香山时即被美国政府挡回，理由是凡学理、工科的中国留学生不准离开美国，强行扣留。安华被挡回后，一直在美东岸马里兰州巴尔的摩城油漆厂工作。凌寒近来也在马里兰大学参加研究药物工作。这几年仍时有信往还，安华来信中随时都表露了迫切要求回国的愿望。
    我不幸于一九五三年得中风病，近虽脱险，但还遗留半身不遂之症。我因爱人去世，又无其他子女，因此更加切望安华能早日返国。
    现在日内瓦举行了中美两国大使级会议，切盼政府通过大使级会议，指名请求美国政府准许刘安华、凌寒及其子女迅速回国。

    我是两个孩子的母亲。孩子们的父亲胡盛恩在一九四五年考取当时公费留学美国。起初，他在美国芝加哥城明尼苏达大学学化学工业。一九四九年下半年转到芝加哥密执安大学研究院。一九五三年六月得博士学位。在以上几年学习过程中，他曾于一九五一年与一九五二年间一再设法回国，不料美国政府竟借口他所学学分不够，不许离境，还硬把他的居留证扣住，这样就使得我丈夫极想回国服务并和家人团聚的愿望不能实现。这样，我的爱人只好在美国一家汽油研究所工作。
    我常常写信给他，向他介绍祖国欣欣向荣的气象。并鼓励他能争取早日回国，最后得到他的复信说：“关于回国问题，我自知努力争取，希望往后不必谈这问题……”我得到他的信后，使我非常耽心，是否因为我常常催他回国，对他有什么不利呢？中美大使级会谈关于平民可以回国问题刚开始谈判的时候，我写了一封信给他，劝他设法早日回来。七月初得到他一封很普通的家信，只谈了一些家事。到今天两个多月了，没有得到他的讯息，在这种情况下，非常焦虑，为他的安全耽心。
    要见自己的亲人是天经地义的事，决不允许任何人来干涉阻挡。我的两个孩子已都在初中念书。他们日夜盼望自己的父亲早日回来。为了培养我们的孩子，为了家庭的幸福，为了让我爱人把他所学的贡献给祖国，我坚决要向美国政府要回自己的亲人。
