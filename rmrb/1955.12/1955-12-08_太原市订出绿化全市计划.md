    Taiyuan City Formulates Citywide Greening Plan
    Relevant departments of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Committee have preliminarily formulated a plan to green Taiyuan, based on natural conditions and the long-term prospects for urban industrial development. It is decided that during the period from the First Five-Year Plan to the Third Five-Year Plan, the area to be greened in urban and suburban areas will reach more than 580,000 mu of land. During this period, various types of forest belts such as protective forest belts, canal forest belts, road protection forests, fruit tree forests, and water source forests will be cultivated in stages and batches. After this plan is realized, the urban area and the surrounding industrial areas will be transformed into areas with lush greenery everywhere.
    Currently, many people are collecting tree seeds everywhere to prepare for a large-scale tree planting and afforestation campaign to be carried out in Taiyuan City in the next two years. More than 8,000 young people from 52 factories, mines, construction sites, government agencies, and other units throughout the city collected more than 16,000 jin of tree seeds with husks in just a few days. Soldiers and students have enthusiastically joined in voluntary labor, and they have already created 1,957 mu of protective forests on the banks of the Fen River from late October to early November.

    太原市订出绿化全市计划
    太原市人民委员会有关部门根据自然条件和城市工业发展远景，已经初步拟定了一个绿化太原的规划。决定在第一个五年计划到第三个五年计划期间，要求在市区和郊区绿化的面积达五十八万多亩土地。在这个期间逐步分期分批地培植防护林带、渠道林带、护路林、果木林、水源林等各种林带。这个计划实现以后，将使市区和工业区周围变成处处绿荫的区域。
    现在，许多人正在四处收集树籽，为今后两年在太原市开展大规模植树造林运动做准备。全市五十二个厂矿、工地、机关等单位的八千多名青年，在几天内就采集了一万六千多斤带皮的树籽。部队的士兵，学校的学生，都热情地投入了义务劳动，他们在十月下旬到十一月上旬期间，已经在汾河岸上营造了一千九百五十七亩防护林。
