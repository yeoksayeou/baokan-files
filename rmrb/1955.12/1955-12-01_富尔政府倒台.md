Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th: The French National Assembly held a vote of confidence on the Faure government on the evening of November 29th. As a result of the vote, the Faure government was overthrown.

    This vote of confidence was held on the issue of the general election. The Faure government supported the Senate's anti-democratic electoral system, and raised the issue of confidence, demanding that the National Assembly put aside the discussion of the government's general policy and give priority to examining the government's bill on early general elections and the electoral system. At the National Assembly meeting on the 29th, many speakers criticized the government's policies.

    In his speech, Duclos, chairman of the Communist parliamentary group, condemned the government for pursuing a policy of colonial suppression in North Africa and for supporting an anti-democratic electoral system.

    Duclos reiterated that the Communist Party is prepared to cooperate with the Socialists and other Republicans in the future elections to defeat the reactionary forces.

    Finally, the meeting proceeded to a vote. 318 votes expressed no confidence in the government, while only 218 votes expressed confidence. Communist deputies voted no confidence; Socialist deputies, as well as many deputies from Faure's own Radical Socialist Party, the Gaullists participating in the government, and the so-called moderate conservatives, also refused to trust the government.

    富尔政府倒台
    据新华社三十日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会在十一月二十九日晚上就信任富尔政府问题进行投票。投票结果，富尔政府被推翻。
    这次信任投票是就大选问题举行的。富尔政府支持了参议院建议的反民主的选举制度，并且提出了信任问题，要求国民议会搁置关于政府总政策的讨论，而优先审议关于提前大选和选举制度的政府法案。在二十九日的国民议会会议上，许多发言的人都批评了政府的政策。
    共产党议会党团主席杜克洛在发言中谴责政府在北非推行殖民镇压政策。谴责政府支持反民主的选举制度。
    杜克洛重申共产党准备在未来的选举中同社会党人和其他共和人士合作，来战胜反动势力。
    最后会议进行了表决。投票表示不信任政府的有三百一十八票，表示信任的只有二百一十八票。共产党议员投不信任票；社会党议员以及富尔自己的激进社会党、参加政府的戴高乐派和所谓温和保守派的许多议员，也拒绝信任政府。
