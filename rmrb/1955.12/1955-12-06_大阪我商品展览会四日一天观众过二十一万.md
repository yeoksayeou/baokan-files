Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, December 5th. The Osaka Chinese Goods Exhibition attracted as many as 215,000 visitors on Sunday the 4th, its first Sunday since opening. In just four days since its opening, the exhibition has attracted 400,000 visitors.

On the morning of the 4th, an hour before opening, the crowd in front of the exhibition hall was already very dense. From noon to 4 p.m., even more people came to visit, and the venue was packed. The visitors included people from all walks of life in Osaka, as well as many visiting groups from all over western Japan.

Japanese workers and mechanical experts praised the Chinese machines. A worker from the Hisada Textile Factory said, "The dust extraction device on the Chinese spinning machine is very good, the design is modern, and it is easy to operate."

China's exquisite handicrafts attracted many visitors. They were particularly interested in the picture "Mount Fuji" embroidered with silk thread by the famous Chinese embroidery artist. One visitor said, "This is amazing art, even better than ordinary oil paintings... Such art expresses the outstanding talent of the Chinese people."

Many worker visitors requested to have discussions with Chinese workers. Female textile workers from Shiga Prefecture, Mie Prefecture, and Kishiwada City in Osaka Prefecture brought many toys and books they made themselves as gifts for the Chinese female textile workers.

    大阪我商品展览会四日一天观众过二十一万
    据新华社大阪五日电　大阪中国商品展览会在开幕后的第一个星期天——四日，参观人数达到二十一万五千人之多。展览会仅仅在开幕后的四天里就吸引了四十万观众。
    四日早晨，在开放前一个小时，展览馆门前的观众已经挤得很满。从正午到下午四点，前来参观的人更多，会场内被挤得水泄不通。参观的人不仅有大阪市的各阶层人士，并且有许多从西日本各地赶来的参观团。
    日本工人和机械专家都很夸奖中国的机器。久大纺织厂的一个工人说：“中国纺纱机的吸尘装置很好，式样也现代化，容易操作”。
    中国精美的手工艺品吸引了很多观众。他们对中国著名的刺绣家用毛丝绣的图画“富士山”特别感到兴趣。一位观众说：“这是惊人的艺术，比普通的油画还好。……这样的艺术表达了中国人民的卓越才能。”
    许多工人观众要求和中国工人座谈。来自滋贺县、三重县和大阪府岸和田市的纺织女工带来许多她们自己做的玩具和书籍，送给中国女纺织工人。
