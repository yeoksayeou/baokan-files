    The Chinese people wholeheartedly welcome the Joint Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the German Democratic Republic. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and other agreements concluded between the two countries are important measures to safeguard the security of both countries and maintain world peace. They are a major development of milestone significance in strengthening the comprehensive fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic.
    The people of the whole world will see from this that the friendship and unity between the Chinese and German peoples are unbreakable, eternal, and unshakable.
    The great and wise German people have made immortal contributions to the development of world civilization over the centuries. The eternal scientific truth of Marxism was discovered by Marx and Engels, sons of the German people. Whether in music, culture, natural science, literature, and so on, the people of the world are proud of the German people's contributions to humanity. Except for a very short period, the Chinese and German peoples have always had rich and profound friendship, and the great contributions of the two peoples to world culture have also enriched the lives of the two peoples. The establishment of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic has further epoch-makingly developed the relations between the two peoples, presenting a new look. Consolidating world peace and seeking human progress are our two countries' common and lofty goals. Building socialism is our two countries' common path; adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is our two countries' common guideline in international relations. The Joint Statement of the two governments expresses the一致看法和主张一致看法和主张consistent views and positions of our two countries on the international situation. The consistency between our two countries arising from the common ideals and common goals of the socialist camp cannot be damaged by any force and is a great source of strength for defending world peace.
    Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of our country, pointed out: "After the end of the anti-fascist war, the German Democratic Republic was established on the land of Germany. This momentous event marks a turning point in European history." This is a solemn fact that all politicians with eyes should have seen long ago. However, the American aggressor group, which is bent on maintaining international tension in an attempt to dominate the world, pretends to be deaf here. It fears the peace-loving German Democratic Republic established on the land of Germany. Because in the center of Europe, in Germany, the source of the two world wars, the emergence of this great force for peace is seriously detrimental to the American aggressor group's conspiracies. The American aggressor group opposes the German Democratic Republic in every way. It is determined to use the military alliance of the North Atlantic Group to divide Europe and control Western Europe. It stubbornly refuses the Soviet Union's repeated proposals to conclude a pan-European collective security treaty. Because of these activities of the United States, the people of Europe, especially the people of West Germany, have long been burdened with heavy armaments and live under the threat of nuclear war.
    For the same reasons that are detrimental to peace, the American aggressor group also stubbornly opposes the People's Republic of China. Despite the opposition of more and more countries, the United States insists on depriving the People's Republic of China of its legitimate rights and status in the United Nations and insists on occupying our territory of Taiwan. The United States' policy of creating division and confrontation and organizing military alliances has divided some regions of Asia and threatened Asian peace.
    The Joint Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the German Democratic Republic states: "The peace of Asia and Europe is indivisible." The Chinese people, the German people, and the world's peace-loving forces, led by the Soviet Union, are inseparable allies in maintaining and consolidating the cause of world peace. As Comrade Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, pointed out, we fully agree with the German Democratic Republic's position on the necessity and ways to rebuild a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany. We also fully support the efforts made by the German Democratic Republic in this regard. The normalization of relations between the People's Republic of China and the Federal Republic of Germany will obviously be conducive to making the peaceful reunification of Germany a peaceful and democratic country. At the same time, the Chinese people deeply believe in the German Democratic Republic's support for our demand for the liberation of Taiwan and the restoration of our legitimate status in the United Nations. The German Democratic Republic's support for the Asian people's just demands for anti-colonialism is a great encouragement to the Asian people's struggle to maintain and strive for national independence and consolidate world peace. We firmly believe that our two countries' joint efforts with the world's peace forces in these just causes cannot be stopped by any force. It must achieve final victory.
    The government delegation of the People's Republic of China and the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic completed important work in a short period. The many documents issued between the two governments demonstrate the firm will and powerful strength of the two peoples to maintain and consolidate world peace. It is entirely beneficial to the lofty cause of consolidating peace and striving for human progress. Peace-loving people all over the world will cherish and welcome these documents published today, because these documents conform to their own vital interests.
    As the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, is about to leave us, we express our deep gratitude. The revolutionary cause of the Chinese people has been aided by the German revolutionary forces. In the past few years of restoring the national economy and building socialism in our country, the German Democratic Republic has also been giving us significant support. Hundreds of German experts are working with us in our factories and laboratories. The achievements of the Chinese people are the achievements of the German people represented by the German Democratic Republic. Under the powerful and unparalleled solidarity and support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, our two peoples will forever advance together on the road to victory.

    欢呼中德友谊的重大发展社论
    中国人民全心欢迎中华人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府联合声明。两国缔结的友好合作条约和其他协定是保障两国的安全、维护世界和平的重要措施。在加强中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国之间全面的兄弟友谊和亲密合作方面，它们是有着里程碑性质的重大发展。
    全世界人民将从这里看到中国人民和德国人民的友谊团结是牢不可破的，是永恒的，不可动摇的。
    伟大的、智慧的德国人民在几个世纪中曾经对世界文明的发展作出了万古不磨的贡献。永恒的科学的真理马克思主义，是德国人民的儿子马克思和恩格斯发现的。无论在音乐、文化、自然科学和文学等等方面，世界人民都为了德国人民对人类的贡献而感到自豪。除了在很短的期间以外，中国人民和德国人民一向有着丰富深厚的友谊，两国人民对于世界文化的伟大贡献同时也就丰富了两国人民彼此的生活。中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的成立更使两国人民的关系得到了划时代的发展，呈现了全新的面貌。巩固世界和平、谋求人类进步是我们两国共同的崇高目标。建设社会主义是我们两国共同的道路；遵守和平共处的五项原则是我们两国在国际关系上共同的指针。两国政府的联合声明表示了我们两国对国际形势的一致看法和主张。由于社会主义阵营的共同理想和共同目标而产生的我们两国的一致性，是任何势力所不能损伤的，是保卫世界和平的力量的伟大源泉。
    我国总理周恩来同志指出：“反法西斯战争结束以后，在德意志的土地上建立了德意志民主共和国。这个巨大的事件标志着欧洲历史的转折点。”这是一切有眼睛的政治家都应该早已看到的庄严事实。但是，一心要保持国际紧张局势，希图借此独霸世界的美国侵略集团却在这里假装痴聋。它害怕在德意志土地上建立起来的爱好和平的德意志民主共和国。因为在欧洲的中心，在两次世界大战的发源地——德国出现的这一巨大的和平力量，对美国侵略集团的阴谋是严重不利的。美国侵略集团从各方面敌视德意志民主共和国。它一心要用北大西洋集团的军事联盟来分裂欧洲，控制西欧。它顽固拒绝苏联多次提出的缔结全欧集体安全条约的建议。由于美国的这些活动，欧洲人民，特别是西德人民长期背负着沉重的军备重担，他们生活在核子战争的威胁下面。
    由于同样的不利于和平的原因，美国侵略集团也顽固地敌视中华人民共和国。尽管遭到越来越多的国家的反对，美国还是坚持剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利和地位，并且坚持侵占我国领土台湾。美国的制造分裂和对立、组织军事联盟的政策，使亚洲有些地区陷于分裂，使亚洲和平受到威胁。
    中华人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府联合声明指出：“亚洲和欧洲的和平是不可分割的。”中国人民、德国人民和以苏联为首的世界爱好和平力量，是维护和巩固世界和平事业中的不可分离的盟友。正如德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥同志所指出的，对于重建一个爱好和平、民主、统一的德国的必要性及其途径，我们完全同意德意志民主共和国的主张。我们并且全力支持德意志民主共和国在这方面所作的努力。中华人民共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系正常化，显然将有利于使德国和平统一成为一个爱好和平的和民主的国家。同时，中国人民也深深信赖德意志民主共和国对于我国解放台湾和恢复我国在联合国的合法地位的要求的支持。德意志民主共和国支持亚洲人民反殖民主义的正义要求，对于亚洲人民维护和争取民族独立、巩固世界和平的斗争是莫大的鼓舞。我们深信，我们两国同世界和平力量一道，在这些正义事业上的共同努力是任何力量所不能阻挡的。它一定要得到最后的胜利。
    中华人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府代表团在短短的期间内完成了重要的工作。两国政府之间发表的许多文件显示了两国人民维护和巩固世界和平的坚决意志和强大力量。对于巩固和平和争取人类进步的崇高事业是完全有利的。全世界爱好和平人民都将珍视和欢迎今天发表的这些文件，因为这些文件符合于他们自己切身的利益。
    在以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国代表团即将离开我们的时候，我们怀着深深的感谢的心情。中国人民的革命事业曾经得到了德意志革命力量的援助，在我国几年来恢复国民经济和建设社会主义的事业中，德意志民主共和国又曾经而且一直在给予我们重大的支援。成百的德国专家正在我们的工厂和研究室里同我们共同工作。中国人民的成就就是德意志民主共和国所代表的德国人民的成就。在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大无比的团结支援之下，我们两国人民将在胜利的道路上永远共同前进。
