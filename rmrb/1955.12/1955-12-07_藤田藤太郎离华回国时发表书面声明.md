Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 6th. When Fujita Totaro, the head of the Japanese Trade Union Delegation, left China to return to Japan, he issued a written statement in Shenzhen, the full text of which is as follows:

    Dear All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Chinese People:
    We, the thirteen members of the Japanese Trade Union Delegation, are sincerely delighted to be able to participate in the visit to your country by the Japanese "National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution." After arriving in your country, we have received your kind care and genuine friendship, and we will return home with boundless gratitude. In your country, we have seen the actual situation of the new China carrying out socialist construction. At the same time, we have come into contact with the noble attitude of your country's workers, who are engaged in production with peace of mind and selflessness in this construction due to safe production, labor protection, the security of life, and the construction of housing. The move towards collectivization in the countryside also demonstrates people's enthusiasm for creating a happy society. We pay our highest respect to this.
    We must increasingly strengthen the friendship and amity between our two countries, and we should make further efforts for peace in Asia and the world. The joint communiqué and cultural agreement jointly issued by the Japanese "National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution" and your country, as well as the agreement on labor movement issues issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and our Japanese Trade Union Delegation, have been signed in order to further strengthen friendship and unity. We are willing to work harder to make the various agreements signed with your country more specific after returning home. As we are about to leave your country, we wish you greater happiness and your country's continued development. We will work for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
    Finally, we thank you for the friendship and kindness you have given us.
          Fujita Totaro, Head of the Japanese Trade Union Delegation
                              December 6th

    亲爱的中华全国总工会和中国人民：
    我们日本工会代表十三人，能够参加日本“拥护宪法国民联合会”访华团访问贵国，感到衷心喜悦。我们来到贵国以后，受到各位亲切的关怀和真正的友谊相待，我们将怀着无限感激的心情回国。在贵国我们看到了新中国进行社会主义建设的实际情况。同时，我们接触到贵国工人在这个建设当中由于安全生产、劳动保护、生活的保障和住宅的建设都安心而忘我地从事生产的崇高的姿态。农村走向合作化也表现了人们创造幸福社会的热情。我们对此致以最高的敬意。
    我们必须愈益加强我们两国之间的友好和亲善，并且应该为亚洲和世界和平作进一步的努力。日本“拥护宪法国民联合会”和贵国共同发表的联合公报和文化协议，以及中华全国总工会和我们日本工会代表团发表的有关工人运动问题的协议，都是为了进一步加强友好和团结而签订的。我们愿意在回国以后为同贵国签订的各项协议的更加具体化而努力。当我们即将离开贵国的时候，愿祝各位的更加幸福和贵国的愈益发展。我们将为两国邦交的早日恢复而努力。
