Youths in Guohuai Township, Wushan County, Launch Campaign to Eliminate Sparrows

The youth and children of Guohuai Township in Wushan County, Gansu Province, have recently launched a campaign to eliminate sparrows. More than 1,500 people throughout the township, mainly youth and children, organized shock brigades and shock teams. They used methods such as hitting with door panels, shooting with slingshots, trapping with cages, crushing with bricks, netting with horsehair, and catching with iron cats. In two days, they eliminated 8,368 sparrows, which is estimated to reduce grain loss for the country by more than 80,000 jin. In the past, sparrows in this township severely damaged crops, sometimes eating almost all the millet and foxtail millet. There used to be a saying: "Ten thousand sparrows, with each rise and fall, eat one dan."

Based on the sparrow-catching experience of Guohuai Township and the severity of sparrow damage there, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League recently called for the organization of one million youth and children throughout the province to launch a large-scale sparrow elimination campaign during the coming winter and spring after snowfall and during the sparrow breeding season. It requires youth and children in various places to basically eliminate sparrow nests around villages and towns, factories, agencies, and schools by the end of January 1956, and strive to completely and thoroughly eliminate all sparrows in the province before the summer harvest in 1956.

    武山县郭槐乡青少年开展消灭麻雀的运动
    甘肃省武山县郭槐乡的青年和少年最近开展了一个消灭麻雀的运动。全乡有一千五百多人以青、少年为主组织了突击队和突击小组，他们利用门板打、弹弓打、枷笼夹、砖头压、马尾网套、铁猫捉等办法，在两天时间内就消灭了八千三百六十八只麻雀，估计可以为国家减少八万多斤粮食损耗。过去这个乡的麻雀损害庄稼很厉害，有时谷子、糜子几乎都被麻雀吃光，当地曾经流行一句话：“麻雀上万，一起一落吃一石”。
    根据郭槐乡的捉麻雀经验和当地麻雀为害的严重性，青年团甘肃省委员会最近号召在全省要组织一百万青年和少年，利用今冬明春下雪后和麻雀产卵期的时机开展大规模的消灭麻雀的活动，要求各地青、少年到一九五六年一月底基本上把乡村周围和城镇的工厂、机关、学校周围的麻雀窝消灭干净，争取在一九五六年夏收以前把全省麻雀全部、彻底地消灭掉。　（新华社）
