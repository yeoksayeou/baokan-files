Comrade esteemed Premier, all comrades of the delegation, comrades, friends:
Just now, Premier Grotewohl, on behalf of the socialists of Germany, the loyal friends and comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people, returned the three volumes of the Yongle Encyclopedia and the banner of the Yihetuan to the Chinese people. I, on behalf of the Chinese people and government who are engaged in socialist construction, express my deep gratitude to you, esteemed Premier, to the government of the German Democratic Republic, and to the German people.
This friendly gesture by the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic fully demonstrates the new type of fraternal relationship between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic. This relationship was established after the people of our two countries established their own regimes and mastered their own destiny in their own countries.
For more than a hundred years, the Chinese people have suffered from the aggression, oppression, plunder and massacre by imperialist countries. During this period, the Chinese people have been bravely struggling against imperialist aggression and feudal oppression in order to win the freedom and independence of their motherland. The Yihetuan Movement in 1900 was precisely a manifestation of the Chinese people's tenacious resistance to imperialist aggression. Their heroic struggle is one of the cornerstones of the great victory of the Chinese people fifty years later. The Chinese people cherish the history and cultural relics of the glorious struggle of their ancestors. Therefore, we accept this gift of great friendship with reverence.
Many historical heritages of the Chinese people are still displayed in the museums of many Western countries as "trophies." The Chinese people cannot forget that, even today, imperialist countries still occupy part of China's territory. However, the Chinese people firmly believe that these so-called "trophies" and that part of the territory will one day be returned to their motherland.
Today, this friendly gesture by the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic gives the Chinese people a new proof, illustrating who are their true friends, who truly respect the historical heritage of the Chinese people, and who truly respect the will of the Chinese people to strive for independence.
The people of our two countries, who have been liberated and are engaged in socialist construction, have forged an unbreakable friendship. Esteemed Premier, I assure you on behalf of the Chinese people that the Chinese people will protect the friendship between our two peoples as they protect their own eyes, and the Chinese people will make strengthening and developing the friendship between our two peoples one of their important tasks.
Long live the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and German peoples!

    在北京各界欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团大会上
    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的总理同志、代表团全体同志们、同志们、朋友们：
    刚才格罗提渥总理代表德意志的社会主义者、中国人民的忠实朋友和战友把永乐大典三本和义和团的旗帜交还给中国人民，我谨代表正在进行社会主义建设的中国人民和政府，向你，敬爱的总理同志，向德意志民主共和国政府，向德意志人民，表示深切的感谢。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团的这一友好的表示，充分地说明了中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的新型的、兄弟般的关系。这种关系是在我们两国人民在自己的国家里建立了自己的政权，掌握了自己的命运以后建立起来的。
    一百多年以来，中国人民受尽了帝国主义国家的侵略、压迫、掠夺和屠杀。中国人民在这个时期里，不断地为争取自己祖国的自由和独立，英勇地进行了反对帝国主义侵略和封建主义压迫的斗争。一九○○年的义和团运动正是中国人民顽强地反抗帝国主义侵略的表现。他们的英勇斗争是五十年后中国人民伟大胜利的奠基石之一。中国人民十分珍重自己祖先光荣斗争的历史和文物。因此，我们以崇敬的心情来接受这个伟大友谊的礼物。
    中国人民的许多历史遗产现在还在许多西方国家的博物馆中作为“战利品”陈列着。中国人民更不能忘记，直到今天，帝国主义国家还霸占着中国的一部分领土。但是，中国人民坚决相信，这些所谓“战利品”和那部分领土总有一天要归还给自己祖国的。
    今天，德意志民主共和国政府代表团的这一友好表示，使中国人民得到一个新的证明，说明谁是他们真正的朋友，谁真正尊重中国人民的历史遗产，谁真正尊重中国人民争取独立的意志。
    已经获得解放并且正在进行社会主义建设的我们两国人民，已经结成了牢不可破的友谊。敬爱的总理同志，我代表中国人民向你保证，中国人民将会像保卫自己的眼珠那样保卫我们两国人民之间的友谊，中国人民将会把加强和发展我们两国人民的友谊作为他们的重要的任务之一。
    中德两国人民兄弟般的友谊万岁！
