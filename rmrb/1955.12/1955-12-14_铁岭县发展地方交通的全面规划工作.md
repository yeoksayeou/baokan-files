Editor's Note: Tieling County, Liaoning Province, based on the needs of the agricultural collectivization movement and the development of industrial and agricultural production, promptly formulated a comprehensive plan for the development of local transportation, fully relying on the people, using local materials, and adapting to local conditions. This will play a significant role in promoting agricultural collectivization and production development. The planning methods used by Tieling County are worth considering in other areas. As the agricultural collectivization movement and the accompanying production increase movement are unfolding in the vast rural areas, local transportation work must adapt to this new situation. Therefore, all regions should, based on specific conditions and actual needs, quickly formulate comprehensive plans for the development of local transportation for 1956 and 1957, and during the Second Five-Year Plan period, to accelerate local transportation construction and powerfully support the agricultural collectivization movement.

Tieling County, Liaoning Province, while comprehensively planning agricultural collectivization and agricultural production, formulated a comprehensive plan for the development of local transportation in the last two years of the First Five-Year Plan and an outline for development during the Second Five-Year Plan.

This plan includes: growth plans for freight and passenger volume and transport capacity; a plan for the socialist transformation of individual transportation businesses; plans for highway maintenance, construction, greening, and the construction of county and township roads; a dock construction plan and an investment plan; and measures to ensure the realization of this plan. According to this plan, by 1957, the county's freight volume will be 578,000 tons, an increase of 18 percent compared to 1955; passenger volume will be 256,000 people, an increase of 13.45 percent compared to 1955; transport capacity will increase by 5.8 percent; 402.5 kilometers of various roads will be maintained and repaired on the basis of existing roads, of which 79 kilometers of highways will be improved from passable in sunny weather but impassable in rainy weather to passable in all weather, 156.5 kilometers of simple highways will be improved from impassable to cars to passable to cars year-round, 131 kilometers of roads passable to rubber-tired carts year-round and to cars in winter and spring will be constructed, and 36 kilometers of industrial and mining branch lines will be constructed; a total of 67 bridges and 265 culverts will be built in two years, and 90 kilometers of highway trunk lines will be greened; by the end of 1957, the semi-socialist collectivization of all 205 privately-owned rubber-tired carts engaged in year-round transportation will be completed; Liaoning Provincial Shipping Bureau will be supported in opening shallow-water tug-barge transportation on the Liao River, two simple docks will be built on the Liao River, the existing five ferry crossings will be repaired, and the management of the ferry crossings will be strengthened; in addition, cart tracks, temporary bridges, and temporary culverts will be appropriately repaired by mobilizing the masses as needed.

The outline for the Second Five-Year Plan for transportation development stipulates that by 1962, the county's freight volume will increase by 33.9 percent compared to 1957, passenger volume will increase by 13 percent, and all county and township roads within the county will be repaired to be passable to cars. At that time, the county will have 210 kilometers of highways passable in all weather, 322 kilometers of highways passable in sunny weather but impassable in rainy weather, and 360 kilometers of highways passable seasonally.

Currently, this plan has been studied and discussed by the enlarged meeting of the County People's Committee and the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee. The County People's Committee has also made a report at the meeting of cadres at the county, district, and township levels. The comrades attending the meeting unanimously expressed their support and determination to implement this plan.

This plan meets the development needs of the agricultural collectivization movement and the urgent demands of the broad masses of farmers. For example, the road from Tieling to the Ninth District (mountainous area) has long been urgently requested by the masses to be built, but it has not been built to this day, thus hindering the development of production in the mountainous area to a certain extent. In 1953, this district suffered from a flood and needed to transport 20,000 jin of buckwheat seeds from Tieling for replanting. As a result, the seeds could not be transported in time due to the poor road conditions, causing more than 1,000 mu of buckwheat to fail to produce ears despite sprouting. In July of this year, 4,000 kilograms of ammonium sulfate fertilizer were also affected in terms of fertilization effectiveness due to untimely transportation. Jiguan Mountain in the Ninth District is 45 kilometers away from Tieling County. It takes the local people three or four days to transport a cart of mountain timber to Tieling, not only failing to make money but also losing money. Furthermore, many villages in the Third and Fourth Districts are located along the Liao River, which are low-lying and suffer from floods year after year. Due to the poor road conditions, the grain needed by the disaster victims cannot be transported in time during spring plowing or summer weeding. Daxunhe Village in the Fourth District is a collectivized village, and most of its land has been cultivated by the tractor station. Because a bridge has not been built, the tractor cannot cross the river, and another part of the village's land cannot be cultivated by tractors. Therefore, the broad masses have high demands and enthusiasm for local transportation construction. The masses in the Ninth District reflected that as long as the road can be built well, they are willing to contribute a few more voluntary workdays. A county people's representative said when visiting the County Transportation Section: "The government is only afraid of affecting production if it does not lead the masses to build roads, but in reality, not building good roads really affects production!"

These facts show that if local transportation work is not done well, it will be impossible to adapt to the needs of the agricultural collectivization movement and the development of industry and agriculture.

From which aspects did Tieling County start to formulate local transportation plans?

First, sort out the current status of local transportation materials, and understand the current road, transportation volume, transportation capacity, and the mobilization and use of civilian labor and vehicles for construction assistance in the county. Classify existing roads according to provincial roads, county roads, and township roads, and understand the length, roadbed width, pavement width and type, number of bridges and culverts, and distribution of sand and gravel materials along each road, and organize them into statistical charts by route. In terms of freight and passenger volume and transport capacity, classify and count the number, tonnage, and completed transportation volume of public and private year-round transport vehicles (including cars and rubber-tired carts), rural sideline vehicles, rural iron-wheeled carts, and urban handcarts, and calculate the total freight and passenger volume and transport capacity of the county. When calculating the total freight and passenger volume, also add transit transportation and the annual increase in the county's freight and passenger volume. Through investigation and sorting out materials, everyone can have a clear understanding of the basic situation of transportation in the county, providing basic data for comprehensive planning.

Second, comprehensively understand and analyze the needs of agricultural collectivization movement and industrial and agricultural production development for transportation. Tieling County considers the following factors: 1. Agricultural collectivization and agricultural production planning. 2. The needs of local industrial departments for transportation to develop mineral resources. 3. The people's demands for transportation. The main focus was on studying more than 30 proposals related to transportation construction during the County People's Congress and the opinions in letters from the people requesting the construction of roads and bridges and culverts. 4. The tasks assigned by higher-level leading organs and the requirements of other organs for local transportation construction. Based on the above needs, starting from calculating the freight and passenger volume increase plan, a plan for road construction and transport capacity increase is proposed. The freight and passenger volume plan is based on the following data: 1. The transportation of commercial grain and agricultural and sideline products from purchasing stations to railway stations (Tieling), and the transportation of fertilizers, seeds, agricultural tools, other agricultural production materials, and rural living materials from railway stations to supply and marketing cooperative stations (separately proposed by the County People's Committee's Agriculture Bureau, Grain Bureau, Supply and Marketing Cooperative, etc.); 2. The transportation of fuel, raw materials, and auxiliary materials from outside the county to local industrial enterprises from railway stations and docks to factories, and the transportation of products from local industrial enterprises from factories to railway stations, docks, and other stations (proposed by the County People's Committee's Industry Bureau); 3. The transportation of basic construction materials from railway stations, docks, and material yards to construction sites; the transportation of cars and rubber-tired carts to and from counties inside and outside the county and transit transportation; short-distance transportation within the city (the transportation company is responsible for collecting data and submitting it). When each department proposes a freight and passenger volume plan, it determines the quantity of goods sent and received (converted into tons), determines the place of shipment and the place of arrival, and the transportation route, which is convenient for finding out the flow of goods, transportation density, and the total freight and passenger volume of the county on each route. In this way, it is possible to rank according to the current road conditions, the transportation density of each route, and the requirements of relevant departments for road construction, and propose a preliminary plan for road maintenance and construction. The number of vehicles needed for the whole year is calculated based on the total annual freight turnover, with a standard of 5,000 ton-kilometers per rubber-tired cart per year, and then balanced with the existing transport capacity, and taking into account the factors of improved operating efficiency after the socialist transformation of the individual transportation industry, a transport capacity increase plan is calculated.

Third, while proposing local transportation construction plans, fully consider all possible internal and external resources that can be mobilized. According to the road construction plan, a total of more than 1.05 million yuan will be invested in 1956 and 1957, of which 260,580 labor days of civilian labor and 61,920 vehicle workdays are required. Calculating on the basis of four labor days per person per year in 1956 and five labor days per person per year in 1957, a total of 298,103 labor days of civilian labor and 61,947 vehicle workdays can be mobilized in two years. At the same time, the investment of the county's finances and the funds subsidized by the Provincial Department of Transportation and relevant organs within the possible scope were calculated.

Fourth, a comprehensive balance was carried out based on the local road construction plan and investment plan. Determine the construction time and required standards for each road according to needs and possibilities. When finally determining the road construction plan, in addition to taking the transportation density as the main basis, the relationship between the route and the local economic, political, and cultural development was also considered. For example, the transportation density of the road from Zhenxibao to Lijiawobao in the Third District is currently relatively small, and will only be about 5,000 ton-kilometers by 1957. It was initially only planned for general repairs, but the County Party Committee considered that whether or not this road is built has a great relationship with the economic development and improvement of the people's lives in the entire Third District and with the connection with the central area, so it was determined that this road must be built in advance.

Fifth, in the process of formulating a comprehensive plan for local transportation, pay attention to closely integrating with the development plan of the entire national economy. For example, according to the national plan, a reservoir will be built on the Fan River. Therefore, when determining the road construction plan from Tieling to Fushun, it was taken into account that some sections of the road may be submerged by the reservoir in the future, and permanent structures will not be built on these sections at present to avoid waste.

The work of Tieling County in formulating a comprehensive plan for local transportation proves that: In order to adapt to the needs of the development of agricultural collectivization, it is completely necessary and possible to formulate a comprehensive plan for regional transportation industry. Not only should a county have a comprehensive plan for local transportation, but a district and a township (village) should also have a transportation plan, because only within the scope of a county, a district, and a township (village) can the basic situation of local transportation be understood more clearly, and the needs of industrial and agricultural production and local people for transportation can be reflected more specifically, so that the plan can be based on a reliable foundation. Facts have proved that local transportation construction must face rural areas, border areas, mountainous areas, and new reclamation areas, especially according to the planning of the overall development of agricultural collectivization, according to the development of industrial and agricultural production and the needs of the broad masses, implement the principles of relying on the people, using local materials, and adapting to local conditions, and build a large number of simple standard highways and county and township roads, bridges and culverts, and ferry crossings suitable for local transportation tools. For the construction of local roads, the problem of insufficient roads should be solved first, and then the quality of roads should be gradually improved to support the rapidly developing agricultural collectivization movement.

    铁岭县发展地方交通的全面规划工作
    马益标
    编者按：辽宁省铁岭县根据农业合作化运动和工农业生产发展的需要，在充分依靠民力、就地取材、因地制宜的原则下，及时制定了发展地方交通的全面规划。这对于促进农业合作化和生产的发展将起重大作用。铁岭县进行规划的方法，值得各地参考。现在农业合作化运动以及随之而来的增产运动正在广大农村展开，地方交通运输工作必须适应这种新情况。因此，各地应该根据具体条件和实际需要，迅速制定一九五六年、一九五七年两年和第二个五年计划期间发展地方交通的全面规划，加速地方交通建设，有力地支援农业合作化运动。
    辽宁省铁岭县在全面规划农业合作化和农业生产的同时，制定了第一个五年计划后两年发展地方交通的全面规划和第二个五年计划的发展纲要。
    这个规划包括：运量、运力的增长计划，对个体运输业进行社会主义改造的计划，公路养护、修建、绿化及县乡道路的修建计划，码头建设计划和投资计划以及保证实现这一规划的措施。按照这个规划，到一九五七年，全县货运量为五十七万八千吨，比一九五五年增长百分之十八；客运量为二十五万六千人，比一九五五年增长百分之十三点四五；运力增长百分之五点八；在旧有道路的基础上养护、整修各种道路四百零二点五公里，其中由晴通雨阻提高到晴雨通车的公路七十九公里，由不通汽车提高到常年通行汽车的简易公路一百五十六点五公里，修建常年通行胶轮大车和冬春两季通行汽车的道路一百三十一公里，修建工矿支线三十六公里；两年内共修桥六十七座，涵管二百六十五座，绿化公路干线九十公里；到一九五七年底，对二百零五辆常年运输的私营胶轮大车全部完成半社会主义的合作化；配合省航运局开辟辽河浅水拖驳运输，在辽河上修建简易码头两座，整修现有的五个渡口并且加强对渡口的管理；此外，对大车道、便桥、便涵，则根据需要随时发动群众适当补修。
    第二个五年计划的交通发展纲要规定，到一九六二年，全县货运量将比一九五七年增长百分之三十三点九，客运量增长百分之十三，县内所有的县乡道路，将整修成为能通行汽车的道路。那时，全县将有晴雨通车的公路二百一十公里，晴通雨阻的公路三百二十二公里，季节通车的公路三百六十公里。
    现在，这个规划已经过县人民委员会扩大会议和中共县委常务委员会的研究讨论。县人民委员会还在县、区、乡三级干部会议上作了报告，到会同志一致表示拥护和支持，决心实现这一计划。
    这个计划符合农业合作化运动的发展需要和广大农民的迫切要求。例如，由铁岭通往九区（山区）的公路，群众很早就迫切要求修通，但是至今尚未修建，因而使山区发展生产受到一定的阻碍。一九五三年，这个区遭受水灾，需由铁岭抢运荞麦种两万斤进行补种，结果因为道路不好未能及时运到，使一千多亩荞麦虽然出了苗，却没有长出穗子来。今年七月，又有四千公斤的硫铵肥料，因为运送不及时影响了追肥的效果。九区鸡冠山距铁岭县城四十五公里，当地群众要把一车山材运往铁岭，路上往返需要三、四天的时间，不但赚不到钱，还得赔本。又如，三、四区的许多乡村位于辽河沿岸，地势低洼，连年遭受水灾，由于道路不好，春耕或夏锄的时候不能把灾民所需要的粮食及时运到。四区大汛河村是一个合作化村，大部分土地已经由拖拉机站代耕，因为有一座桥未修建，拖拉机过不了河，这个村的另一部分土地无法使用拖拉机耕作。因此，广大群众对地方交通建设的要求和积极性是很高的。九区的群众反映，只要能把路修好，多出几个义务建勤工也愿意。有一个县人民代表访问县交通科的时候曾说：“政府只是怕影响生产不领导群众修路，实际上不修好路才真的影响生产呢！”
    这些事实表明，如果不做好地方交通工作，便无法适应农业合作化运动和工农业发展的需要。
    铁岭县从那些方面入手制定地方交通规划呢？
    第一，整理地方交通现状资料，摸清全县现有道路、运量、运力的情况和民工及车辆建勤的动员和使用情况。对现有道路按省道、县道、乡道分类，摸清每条路的长度、路基宽度、路面宽度和种类、桥涵数量、沿线沙石料分布等情况，按路线整理成统计图表。在运量和运力方面，按公营、私营常年运输车辆（包括汽车、胶轮大车），农村副业车辆，农村铁轮大车和城市手推车的数量、吨位及其完成的运输量等进行分类统计，计算出全县的总运量和总运力。在计算总运量的时候，并且加上过境运输以及全县运量逐年增长的幅度。通过摸底和整理材料，使大家对全县交通运输的基本情况做到心中有数，为全面规划提供了基础资料。
    第二，全面了解和分析农业合作化运动和工农业生产的发展对交通运输的需要。铁岭县是从下面几个因素来考虑的：一、农业合作化和农业生产的规划。二、地方工业部门开发矿产，对交通运输的需要。三、人民群众对交通的要求。主要是研究了县人民代表大会期间，有关交通建设的提案三十多条以及人民来信中要求修建道路和桥涵的意见。四、上级领导机关交给的任务和其他机关对地方交通建设的要求。根据上述需要，从计算运量增长计划做起，再提出道路修建及运力增长的计划。运量计划根据下列资料来制定：一、商品粮、农副产品由采购站向火车站（铁岭）的运输情况，从外地运来的肥料、种籽、农具、其它农业生产资料以及农村生活资料，由火车站到各地供销合作社站点的运输情况。（分别由县人民委员会的农业局、粮食局、供销合作社等单位提出）；二、地方工业企业由外地运来的燃料、原料、辅助材料，从火车站、码头到工厂的运输，地方工业企业的产品由工厂到火车站、码头及其它站点的运输（由县人民委员会的工业局提出）；三、基本建设材料由火车站、码头和材料场到工程现场的运输；汽车、胶轮大车向县内县外的运输以及过境运输；市内短距离的运输（由运输公司负责搜集资料提出）。各部门在提出运量计划的时候，都确定发货数量和进货数量（折合成吨计算），确定发货地点和到达地点，以及运输线路，便于求出每条线路上的货物流向、运输密度和全县的总运量。这样，就能够根据现有道路的情况、各线路的运输密度以及有关部门对道路建设的要求进行排队，提出道路养护修建的初步计划。根据全年的货运周转总量以每辆胶轮大车年产五千吨公里的标准计算出全年需要的车辆数，再和现有的运力平衡，并且考虑到对个体运输业进行社会主义改造后营运效率提高的因素计算出运力增长计划。
    第三，在提出地方交通建设计划的同时，充分考虑到一切可能动员的内部和外部的资源。根据道路修建计划，一九五六年和一九五七年两年共需投资一百零五万多元，其中需民工二十六万零五百八十人工日，车辆六万一千九百二十车工日。一九五六年按每年每人出四个工日计算，一九五七年按每人每年出五个工日计算，两年共可动员民工二十九万八千一百零三人工日、车辆六万一千九百四十七车工日。同时，计算了县财政的投资、省交通厅和有关机关在可能范围内补助的资金。
    第四，根据地方道路修建计划和投资计划进行了综合平衡工作。按照需要和可能确定每条道路的修建时间和要求达到的标准。在最后确定道路建设计划的时候，除以运输密度作为主要依据外，还考虑到该线路对当地经济、政治、文化发展方面的关系。例如，三区镇西堡到李家窝堡的道路，目前运输密度较小，到一九五七年也仅有五千吨公里左右，开始只打算作一般整修，但是，中共县委会考虑到这条道路的修建与否，对整个三区的经济发展和人民生活的改善以及和中心区的联系各方面关系很大，因此确定必需提前修建这条道路。
    第五，在制定地方交通全面规划的过程中，注意密切结合整个国民经济的发展计划。例如，按照国家的计划将要在泛河上修建一座水库，因此在确定铁岭到抚顺的公路修建计划时，即考虑到有些路段将来可能被水库淹没，在这些路段上目前不修建永久性的构造物，以免造成浪费。
    铁岭县制定地方交通全面规划的工作证明：为适应农业合作化发展的需要，制定地区性的交通运输业的全面规划是完全必要和可能的。不仅一个县要有地方交通的全面规划，一个区、乡（村）都应该有交通运输的规划，因为只有在一个县、一个区、一个乡（村）的范围内，才能更清楚地了解当地的交通运输的基本情况，才能更具体地反映出工农业生产和当地人民对交通运输的需要，从而使计划建立在可靠的基础上。事实证明，地方交通建设必需面向农村、边疆、山区和新的农垦区，特别是要根据农业合作化全面发展的规划，根据工农业生产的发展和广大群众的需要，贯彻执行依靠民力、就地取材、因地制宜的原则，大量修建简易标准的公路和适合当地运输工具的县乡道路、桥涵和渡口。对地方道路的修建，应该先解决道路不足的问题，然后逐步提高道路质量，以支援迅速发展的农业合作化运动。
