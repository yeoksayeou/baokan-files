    Following a three-week visit to India, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, and the member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Khrushchev, have left India and traveled to Afghanistan for a friendly visit at the invitation of the Afghan government. During their visit to India, the Soviet leaders and Indian Prime Minister Nehru frankly and unreservedly exchanged views on various international issues and issued a joint statement on December 13 regarding the results of their exchange. At the same time, in accordance with the spirit indicated in the joint statement by the leaders of the two governments, representatives of the Soviet and Indian governments held talks on the development of economic cooperation and cultural exchange between the two countries, issued a joint communiqué on economic relations between India and the Soviet Union, and reached an agreement on expanding cultural exchanges between the two countries.
    During the visit of the Soviet leaders to India, the Indian people vividly expressed their deep feelings for the Soviet Union. Wherever the Soviet leaders went, whether to cities or villages, they were warmly welcomed and treated kindly by the Indian people. This heartfelt enthusiasm and affection of the Indian people demonstrated their admiration for the great socialist country, the Soviet Union. The achievements and victories of the Soviet people have inspired the Indian people's struggle for freedom and independence; and the Soviet people's honest and selfless attitude towards the Indian people, and their unremitting efforts to strive for peace and promote international cooperation, have enabled the Indian people to truly recognize that the Soviet Union is their most reliable friend. The signing and implementation of the Soviet-Indian joint statement and joint communiqué will further promote the strengthening of friendship between the two peoples; and the further development of Soviet-Indian friendly and cooperative relations will undoubtedly help to consolidate peace in Asia and the world.
    In view of the universal desire of the people of the world for peace and the elimination of the threat of war, the Soviet-Indian joint statement emphasizes that international relations should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and that every effort should be made to ease international tensions and promote peace and international cooperation. To this end, the leaders of the Soviet and Indian governments unanimously agreed that the unconditional prohibition of the production, use, and testing of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, substantial reductions in conventional armaments, and the establishment of effective international supervision should be achieved, and that the formation of military alliances or regional military blocs should be rejected. The joint statement believes that the disappointment of the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers' Conference can only be temporary, and that every effort must continue to be made to further ease the international situation and to use negotiations as the only method of resolving disputes. The firm efforts and propositions of the leaders of the Soviet and Indian governments to seek world peace correctly express the good will of all peace-loving humanity and inspire their confidence and strength in striving for peace.
    In order to achieve consolidated peace in Asia, the leaders of the Soviet and Indian governments paid great attention to the pressing problems currently existing in Asia and expressed a clear attitude towards resolving these pressing problems. These problems are: the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China to its coastal islands and Taiwan should be satisfied; the People's Republic of China should be restored to its legitimate position in the United Nations; the Korean issue should be resolved on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the Korean people and in accordance with the interests of peace in the Far East; and the Vietnamese and Laotian issues should be resolved in accordance with the Geneva Accords to eliminate the existing obstacles. The joint statement specifically pointed out that the Sino-American talks held in Geneva should not only seek solutions to the issues currently under discussion, but also achieve broader mutual understanding between China and the United States through higher-level meetings. The Chinese people fully agree with the issues and solutions proposed by the Soviet Union and India. The clear attitude of the Soviet and Indian governments on these Asian issues will undoubtedly have a positive impact on peace in Asia.
    One of the most effective ways to promote world peace and eliminate international tensions is to establish and strengthen economic and cultural ties between countries and eliminate obstacles to mutual cooperation and understanding. The leaders of the Soviet Union and India expressed in the joint statement the unanimous desire of the two countries to develop economic cooperation and strengthen cultural exchanges, and will further consult to reach agreements on specific issues. The economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and India will not only have a far-reaching impact in Asia and Africa, but is also an event of world significance. The great significance of Soviet-Indian economic cooperation lies in the fact that the Soviet Union is a socialist country with strong industrial productivity and advanced technological experience, which is willing and never attaches any political conditions to helping economically underdeveloped countries; on the other hand, after shaking off colonial oppression and gaining independence, the Indian people are using all their strength to develop their own independent economy in order to build a strong national industry. The further expansion of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and India, which have different social systems, will set a good example for other countries, and this kind of economic cooperation is in stark contrast to the so-called "aid" of Western countries. The great significance of strengthening economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and India also lies in the fact that economic relations based on equality and mutual benefit will greatly help India's construction, and a strong India is an important factor in consolidating peace in Asia and the world.
    It is precisely because imperialism fears that the Soviet Union will help Asian countries establish their own independent economic base that they are doing everything possible to obstruct and undermine it. During the visit of the Soviet leaders to India and Burma, reactionary British and American newspapers and politicians frantically attempted to distort the facts and deceive the public, which exposed their ugly intentions. US Secretary of State Dulles even openly defended Portugal's colonial rule over Goa, attempting to put pressure on India. However, this will only make the Indian people more clearly recognize who are the true friends of the Indian people. Imperialism is so afraid of international cooperation and the expansion of trade relations between the Soviet Union and Asian countries because they are afraid that India and other Asian countries will establish and develop their own independent industries and no longer become commodity sales markets and raw material supply bases for Western colonial countries.
    However, profound changes have taken place in Asia. Today, the demand for peace and opposition to war; the demand for the development of an independent economy and the strengthening of international economic cooperation; and the firm opposition to colonialism have become the universal aspirations of the Asian people and the inevitable trend of historical development. This cannot be stopped by any reactionary force. Especially because there are countries like the Soviet Union, India, and China, which account for half of the world's population, united with the people of other peace-loving countries in Asia, it will be possible to firmly grasp the destiny of the Asian people in their own hands. Although Western colonialists are still engaged in a desperate struggle in Asia, trying to maintain their rule over the Asian people, the colonial system is rapidly collapsing, their era is gone forever, and the Asian people will resolutely strengthen equal and mutually beneficial international cooperation and build their own independent and prosperous lives according to their own wishes.

### 苏印友好关系的新发展

    苏印友好关系的新发展
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫在印度访问了三个星期之后，已经离开印度，应邀到阿富汗进行友好访问。在访问印度期间，苏联领袖和印度总理尼赫鲁对目前国际局势的各项问题坦率而无拘束地交换了意见，并在十二月十三日就交换意见的结果发表了联合声明。同时，根据两国政府领袖联合声明中所指出的精神，苏印两国政府代表对发展两国间经济合作和文化交流的问题进行了会谈，发表了关于印度和苏联经济关系的联合公报，达成了一项关于扩大苏印两国文化交流的协议。
    在苏联领袖访问印度期间，印度人民鲜明地表现了对苏联的深厚感情。苏联领袖无论到任何城市或乡村，都受到印度人民的热烈欢迎和亲切款待。印度人民这种衷心流露的热情和友爱，表现了他们对伟大的社会主义国家苏联的钦佩。苏联人民的成就和胜利，鼓舞了印度人民争取自由和独立的斗争；而苏联人民对待印度人民的正直无私的态度，苏联人民为争取和平和促进国际合作所作的坚持不懈的努力，使得印度人民真正地认清了苏联是自己最可靠的朋友。苏印两国联合声明和联合公报的签订和实施，必将更加促进两国人民友谊的加强；而苏印友好合作关系的进一步发展，毫无疑问将有助于巩固亚洲和世界和平。
    鉴于世界人民要求和平和消除战争威胁的普遍愿望，苏印联合声明中强调指出，国际关系应当以和平共处的五项原则为基础，应当尽一切可能来缓和国际紧张局势，促进和平和国际合作。为此，苏印两国政府领袖一致认为，应当实现无条件地禁止生产、使用和试验核子武器和热核子武器，大量裁减常规军备和建立有效的国际监督，并排斥建立军事联盟或者区域性军事集团的办法。联合声明认为，对日内瓦四国外交部长会议的失望只能是暂时的，必须继续竭尽一切努力，争取国际局势继续和缓下来，把谈判当作解决争端的唯一方法。苏印两国政府领袖这种谋求世界和平的坚定努力和主张，正确地表达了一切爱好和平人类的善良意志，鼓舞他们争取和平的信心和力量。
    为使亚洲获得巩固的和平，苏印两国政府领袖对目前亚洲存在的迫切问题给予极大的注意，并表示了解决这些迫切问题的明确态度。这些问题就是：中华人民共和国对于沿海岛屿和台湾的合法权利应当得到满足；中华人民共和国应当在联合国恢复它的合法地位；朝鲜问题应当在承认朝鲜人民的民族权利的基础上，按照远东和平的利益，求得解决；越南问题和老挝问题则应依照日内瓦协议消除目前所存在的障碍。联合声明特别指出，在日内瓦举行的中美会谈，不仅应把现在所讨论的问题求得解决，而且中美两国间应通过更高级的会议达到更广泛的相互谅解。中国人民完全同意苏印两国所提出的这些问题和解决这些问题的办法。苏印两国政府对这些亚洲问题的明确态度，无疑地将会对亚洲和平带来良好的影响。
    促进世界和平和消除国际紧张气氛的最有效途径之一，就是建立和加强各国之间的经济和文化的联系，消除相互合作和相互了解方面的障碍。苏印两国领袖在联合声明中表示了两国对发展经济合作和加强文化交流的一致愿望，并将进一步进行协商，以便就具体问题达成协议。苏印两国的经济合作不仅将在亚非国家中发生深远的影响，并且是具有世界意义的事件。苏印经济合作的巨大意义，在于：苏联是拥有强大工业生产力和先进技术经验的社会主义国家，它乐于而且从不附有任何政治条件帮助经济不发达的国家；而另一方面，印度人民在摆脱了殖民压迫获得独立之后，正用一切力量来发展自己的独立经济，以便建立强大的民族工业。社会制度不同的苏印两国进一步扩大经济合作，将为其他国家树立良好的榜样，这种经济合作和西方国家的所谓“援助”，形成了鲜明的对照。苏印加强经济合作的巨大意义还在于：建立在平等和互利基础上的经济关系，必将在很大程度上有助于印度的建设，而一个强大的印度，乃是巩固亚洲和世界和平的重要因素。
    正是帝国主义害怕苏联帮助亚洲国家建立自己的独立经济基础，因此它们千方百计地进行阻挠和破坏。在苏联领袖访问印度和缅甸期间，英美反动报纸和政客疯狂地企图歪曲事实和欺骗公众，这就暴露了他们这种丑恶的用心。美国国务卿杜勒斯甚至公开袒护葡萄牙对果阿的殖民统治，企图对印度施加压力。但是，这只有使印度人民更清楚地认识，谁是印度人民的真正的朋友。帝国主义这样害怕国际合作，害怕苏联同亚洲国家的贸易关系的扩大，是因为它们害怕印度和其他亚洲国家建立和发展自己的独立工业，不再成为西方殖民国家的商品销售市场和原料供给地。
    但是，亚洲已经发生了深刻的变化。在今天，要求和平，反对战争；要求发展独立的经济，加强国际间的经济合作，坚决反对殖民主义，已经成为亚洲人民的普遍愿望和历史发展的必然趋势。这是任何反动力量也阻挡不住的。特别是因为有了像苏联、印度和中国这样拥有世界人口一半的国家，同亚洲其他爱好和平国家人民团结一致，这就一定能够使亚洲人民的命运紧紧地掌握在亚洲人民自己的手里。侭管西方殖民者还在亚洲进行绝望的挣扎，竭力想要保持它们对亚洲人民的统治，但是，殖民制度是在迅速地崩溃中，它们的时代已经一去不复返了，亚洲人民将坚决地按照自己的愿望，加强平等互利的国际合作，建设自己独立和繁荣的生活。
