Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 27th: The government of the Mongolian People's Republic issued a statement on December 25th regarding the question of the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations Organization. The full text is as follows:

The Mongolian People's Republic, as a peace-loving democratic country, began to submit applications to be admitted as a member of the United Nations Organization as early as 1946, expressing its willingness to undertake all the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter. The Mongolian people, who have been waiting for nine years for their request to be satisfied, firmly believe that the issue of admitting the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations Organization will be positively resolved at the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The United Nations General Assembly adopted, with an overwhelming majority of fifty-two votes, Canada's proposal to simultaneously admit eighteen countries, including the Mongolian People's Republic, to the United Nations Organization. However, during the Security Council's discussion of the United Nations General Assembly's recommendation on the admission of new members, the issue of admitting the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations Organization was delayed due to the sabotage of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This incident has aroused, and will continue to arouse, great anger among the Mongolian people. Mass rallies and conferences have been held throughout the country, with attendees expressing strong protests against the violation of the sovereign Mongolian state's right to be a member of the United Nations.

The public of the Mongolian People's Republic has adopted an open letter to the people of Asia and the world, demanding the immediate expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the granting of the People's Republic of China its legitimate rights in the United Nations. The Mongolian people are convinced that the Mongolian People's Republic will obtain its rightful place in the United Nations at the next session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Recently, at a meeting of the Security Council, the British representative submitted a proposal suggesting that the Security Council express its hope that Japan would be admitted to the United Nations soon. The Soviet representative proposed an amendment to this proposal, stipulating that Mongolia should also be admitted to the United Nations at the same time as Japan. The Mongolian People's Republic made practical contributions to the anti-fascist aggression of the people of all countries during World War II. It has consistently pursued a peaceful policy and fully meets the requirements of the United Nations Charter.

As everyone knows, the United Nations Charter does not set any conditions for joining the United Nations as a member state, only requiring that new member states be peace-loving countries. Those who oppose the United Nations' admission of the Mongolian People's Republic have put forward completely untenable arguments to justify their discriminatory policy against the Mongolian People's Republic, attempting to cast doubt on the national legal status of the Mongolian People's Republic and deny its international standing.

It is universally known that the independent, democratic Mongolian state has been established for thirty-five years, and it has been legally recognized by many member states of the United Nations. The Mongolian People's Republic now has diplomatic relations with countries representing more than half of humanity, including the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of India.

In view of the above, the government of the Mongolian People's Republic, representing the will and aspirations of the Mongolian people, firmly maintains that the issue of admitting the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations should be resolved affirmatively the next time the United Nations discusses the issue of admitting new members.

    蒙古人民共和国政府  
    发表关于联合国组织接纳蒙古问题的声明
    新华社乌兰巴托二十七日电　蒙古人民共和国政府十二月二十五日发表了关于联合国组织接纳蒙古人民共和国问题的声明，全文如下：
    蒙古人民共和国作为一个爱好和平的民主国家早在一九四六年就开始不止一次地提出关于要求被接纳为联合国组织会员国的申请，表示愿意承担联合国宪章所规定的一切义务。九年来一直等待着自己的要求得到满足的蒙古人民完全相信，关于接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国组织的问题一定将在联合国大会第十届会议上得到积极的解决。
    联合国大会以五十二票的压倒多数通过了加拿大关于同时接纳十八国，其中包括蒙古人民共和国，加入联合国组织的建议。但是，在安全理事会讨论联合国大会关于接纳新会员国的建议的时候，关于接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国组织的问题由于蒋介石分子的捣乱而延搁了，这件事引起了，并且将继续引起蒙古人民的极大的愤怒。全国各地举行了群众集会和大会，到会者都表示坚决抗议侵犯主权的蒙古国家作为联合国会员国的权利。
    蒙古人民共和国公众通过了告亚洲和世界人民书，要求立即驱逐蒋介石分子和赋予中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。蒙古人民确信：蒙古人民共和国必将在联合国大会下届会议上获得自己在联合国中的地位。
    最近，在安全理事会会议上，英国代表曾提出一项提案，建议安全理事会表示希望日本能很快地被接纳进入联合国，苏联代表对这项提案提出修正案，规定在接纳日本的同时也接纳蒙古人民共和国进入联合国。蒙古人民共和国在第二次世界大战时对各国人民的反法西斯侵略作出了实际的贡献，它一贯执行着和平政策，它是完全符合联合国宪章的要求的。
    大家知道，联合国宪章对加入联合国为会员国没有提出任何条件，仅仅要求新会员国是爱好和平的国家。反对联合国接纳蒙古人民共和国的人提出了完全站不住脚的论据，来为自己对蒙古人民共和国的歧视政策辩解，企图使人怀疑蒙古人民共和国的国家法律地位和否认它的国际地位。
    举世皆知，独立的、民主的蒙古国家成立以后已经进入了第三十五年，它已经为联合国的许多会员国在法律上所承认。蒙古人民共和国现在同占人类一半以上的国家有外交关系，其中有苏联、中华人民共和国、印度共和国。
    鉴于以上所述，蒙古人民共和国政府代表蒙古人民的意志和愿望，坚决主张：关于接纳蒙古人民共和国进入联合国的问题应该在联合国下一次讨论接纳新会员国问题的时候就加以肯定的解决。
