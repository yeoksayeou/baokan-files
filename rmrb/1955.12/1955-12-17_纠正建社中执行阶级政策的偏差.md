    Correcting Deviations in the Implementation of Class Policy in the Establishment of Cooperatives
    Ji Xichen
    Around the autumn harvest, the agricultural cooperative movement in Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, experienced vigorous development. Although the movement was generally normal, many areas did not earnestly implement the Party's class policy during the establishment of cooperatives, which seriously affected the quality of the newly established cooperatives.

    During the establishment of cooperatives, some rural cadres did not conduct thorough reviews of the political background of the members, leading to landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries infiltrating the cooperatives. In order to surpass other villages quickly, the cadres of People's Village not only failed to examine the political situation of cooperative members during the establishment of the cooperative, but also mistakenly put forward the slogan "Do not leave out a single household." As a result, landlords, rich peasants, reactionary leaders, and others who were absorbed into the newly established cooperative accounted for more than 12 percent of the total number of farming households. These people stirred up trouble within the cooperative, took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, putting the newly established agricultural cooperative on the brink of collapse.

    Some cadres still believed that poor peasants were "thin people, thin cattle, thin land, and thin pigs," fearing that having too many poor peasants would obscure the superiority of the cooperative. They not only failed to rely on poor peasants to run the cooperative, but continued to exclude and restrict poor peasants from joining. In Yuxi Township, 48 poor peasant households who firmly requested to join the cooperative were denied membership. Since many poor peasants were excluded from the cooperative, those who had already joined naturally did not occupy a dominant position in the leadership of the cooperative. Among the 127 committee members in this township, only 15 were poor peasants. Therefore, when dealing with specific issues such as draft cattle, farm tools, and investments, the interests of poor peasants were harmed, and the wealthy middle peasants took advantage of the poor peasants. Among the 55 draft cattle priced for cooperative membership in this township, those purchased by poor peasants with state loans were generally priced 10 percent lower than the market price, while those of middle peasants were generally priced about 10 percent higher than the market price. The draft cattle of wealthy middle peasant Zeng Guoqing was priced at 100 yuan, which was already basically reasonable, but because he made a lot of noise, another ten yuan was added. Before the payment period arrived, the cooperative committee members paid him a portion of the loan in advance. The draft cattle jointly purchased by poor peasants Yang Shineng and others were priced at only 50 yuan by the cooperative, which was more than 42 percent lower than the market price.

    Forcing wealthy middle peasants to join the cooperative also occurred during the establishment of cooperatives. The deputy secretary of the Qiuxi District Committee of the Communist Party, in order to force wealthy middle peasants to join the cooperative, arbitrarily stipulated that wealthy middle peasants who did not join would not be allowed to enter the sugar factories for production (the local area is rich in sugarcane). Chen Guoquan, the deputy director of the Yuxi Agricultural Cooperative, summoned wealthy middle peasants He Bingyin and others, threatening, "If you don't join this year, you won't be able to escape next year!" In this way, four wealthy middle peasant households were frightened into joining the cooperative. Among the 46 members of the newly established Zhonghua Agricultural Cooperative, 15 wealthy middle peasant households were forced to join, and 13 of them have now requested to withdraw from the cooperative. In this cooperative, incidents of destroying production such as dead cattle and selling pigs have also occurred.

    Situations similar to the above existed to varying degrees in one-third of the villages in the county that had basically achieved cooperation.

    Why did these phenomena occur? In addition to the lack of in-depth propaganda of the Party's class policy during the establishment of cooperatives, and the lack of a unified and comprehensive understanding of the Party's class policy among many cadres, the main reason was that some Party members and cadres whose economic status had risen were influenced by capitalist ideology, had a blurred class perspective, and could not see the enthusiasm and strength of poor peasants in running cooperatives. Among the 62 Party members in Yuxi Township, 39 looked down on poor peasants and did not believe that relying on poor peasants could run the cooperative well. During the establishment of the cooperative in Gonghe Village, Communist Party member Zhou Congshu excluded 12 poor peasant households from joining the cooperative, telling the branch, "These people are all paupers, they are not enthusiastic about joining the cooperative, and you can't even find a production team leader. Even if a cooperative is established, it won't be run well. If you insist on letting them join, I would rather not be the director." In some township branches, some Party members of wealthy middle peasant origin who were influenced by capitalist ideology did not accept the Party's education well and had serious resistance to the cooperative movement led by the Party, hindering the correct implementation of the Party's class policy. For example, among the 34 Party members in the original Aijia Township, there were 14 new and old Party members of wealthy middle peasant origin; among the six branch committee members, four were new and old Party members of wealthy middle peasant origin. Among the sixteen major rural cadres at the grassroots level, nine were new and old wealthy middle peasants. When this township was establishing cooperatives, it selected wealthy middle peasants as the backbone for running the cooperatives. Among the seventeen directors and deputy directors, nine were wealthy middle peasants. Liu Xianhua, a Party member who rose to become a wealthy middle peasant and whose thinking was backward, rarely managed the work of the cooperative after being elected as deputy director. When the members asked him to attend meetings, he said, "If we only have meetings, we still need to eat." Li Rongsen, a Party member whose family was of old wealthy middle peasant origin, was not active in his work after joining the cooperative. The Party branch notified him to attend meetings three times, and he refused to participate. The branch secretary criticized him, but he said, "Since I came out of my mother's womb, I have never been as hungry and emaciated as I am after joining the cooperative." He adopted a completely antagonistic attitude toward the Party. In addition, impure leadership composition in grassroots organizations was also an important reason for the failure to correctly implement the class policy. Among the 233 Party members, administrative cadres, and cooperative committee members in Yuxi Township, there were seven class dissidents and six others with unclear political backgrounds, accounting for more than 2.5 percent of the total. He Shuzhang, who used to be a lackey of landlords and bullies, protected bandits and let go of bullies after infiltrating the Party. During the cooperative movement, he also undermined the Party's policy and suppressed the enthusiasm of poor peasants to join the cooperative.

    In order to correct the deviations in the implementation of the class policy in the establishment of cooperatives, the Zizhong County Committee of the Communist Party of China is combining the work of rectifying and consolidating the cooperatives with a widespread campaign of Party rectification and Youth League rectification. Party members and cadres with a blurred class stance and influenced by rich peasant thought have been subjected to self-criticism and criticism. Landlords, rich peasant elements, and other elements with unclear political backgrounds who have infiltrated the Party and cooperatives have been resolutely purged. Agricultural cooperatives where wealthy middle peasants occupy a leadership advantage have also been adjusted and reorganized according to their respective circumstances, and the backbone of poor peasants has been increased.

    纠正建社中执行阶级政策的偏差
    纪希晨
    秋收前后，四川省资中县农业合作化运动有了蓬勃的发展。运动虽然一般是正常的，但是不少地区在建社中没有认真执行党的阶级政策，因而严重地影响了新建社的质量。
    在建社中，有些乡村工作人员没有对社员的政治情况进行周密的审查，以致地主、富农、反革命分子混进了合作社。人民村的工作人员为了一下子赶过别的村庄，建社的时候，不仅不审查社员的政治情况，而且错误地提出“不漏掉一户”的口号，结果，一个刚刚成立起来的合作社吸收入社的地主、富农、反动会首等竟占全社农户的百分之十二以上。这些人在社内惹是生非，趁机造谣破坏，使刚刚建立的农业合作社就面临着垮台的威胁。
    有些工作人员，仍然认为贫农“人瘦、牛瘦、地瘦、猪瘦”，怕贫农多了显示不出合作社的优越性，不仅不依靠贫农办社，而且继续排斥、限制贫农入社。鱼溪乡就有四十八户坚决要求入社的贫农，被拒绝吸收入社。许多贫农既然被排斥在社外，已经入社的贫农，在合作社领导骨干中当然也就占不上优势。这个乡一百二十七个社务委员中，贫农只有十五人。因此，在处理耕牛、农具、投资等具体问题的时候，损害了贫农的利益，使富裕中农占了贫农的便宜。在这个乡里，折价入社的五十五条耕牛中，凡是贫农用国家贷款伙买的耕牛，一般都比市价低百分之十，而中农的牛一般都较市价高百分之十左右。富裕中农曾国清的耕牛折价一百元，已经基本合理了，但是因为他多次大闹，结果又添了十元；付款期未到，社委们就提早从贷款中付给了他一部分。贫农杨世能等人伙买的耕牛，社里只折价五十元，竟比市价低百分之四十二还多。
    在建社中，也发生了强迫富裕中农入社的现象。中共球溪区区委副书记，为了强迫富裕中农入社，擅自规定富裕中农不入社，就不准进糖房生产（当地盛产甘蔗）。鱼溪农业合作社副社长陈国全召集富裕中农何秉银等，威胁说：“今年不入，明年也跑不脱！”四户富裕中农就这样被吓进了社。新建立的中华农业合作社的四十六户社员中，被强拉入社的十五户富裕中农，其中有十三户现在已经提出要求退社，在这个社里，死牛、卖猪等破坏生产的现象也发生了。
    类似上述情况，在全县基本合作化的三分之一的村庄中，都不同程度地存在。
    为什么会发生这些现象呢？除了建社中没有深入宣传党的阶级政策，不少干部对于党的阶级政策还缺乏统一的全面的了解外，主要是一部分经济地位上升了的党员干部，受了资本主义思想的影响，阶级观点模糊，看不见贫农办社的积极性和力量。鱼溪乡六十二个党员中，瞧不起贫农、不相信依靠贫农能办好社的有三十九个。共和村共产党员周从书在建社中，排斥十二户贫农入社，他对支部说：“这些人尽是穷鬼，入社又不积极，连生产队长也找不出一个，建起社来也办不好，要是一定叫他们入社，我不当社长都要得。”有的乡支部中，受资本主义思想影响的一部分富裕中农成份的党员没有很好接受党的教育，对于党所领导的合作化运动有严重的抵触情绪，阻碍了党的阶级政策的正确执行。如原艾家乡三十四个党员中，新、老富裕中农成份的党员就有十四人；六个支部委员中，新、老富裕中农成份的党员四人。基层干部中，十六个乡村主要干部，新、老富裕中农即有九人。这个乡在建社的时候，挑选为办社骨干的多是富裕中农。十七个正、副社长中，就有九个是富裕中农。因上升到富裕中农而思想落后的党员刘仙华，自从被选为副社长以后，就很少管社的工作。社员叫他开会，他却说：“光开会，未必就不吃饭了。”党员李荣森家庭是老富裕中农成份，入社以后不积极工作。党支部三次通知开会，他都拒绝参加。支部书记批评他，他竟说：“我从娘肚子里出来，就没有像入合作社这样饿得皮黄肌瘦的。”对党采取完全对立的态度。另外，基层组织中领导成份不纯，也是不能正确执行阶级政策的一个重要原因。鱼溪乡二百三十三个党员、行政干部和社务委员中，混入的阶级异己分子有七人。其他政治面目不清的有六人，占总数的百分之二点五多。何述章过去是地主恶霸的狗腿子，混入党内以后，包庇土匪、放走恶霸。合作化运动中，他又破坏党的政策，打击贫农入社情绪。
    为了纠正建社中执行阶级政策的偏差，中共资中县委正结合整顿、巩固合作社的工作，普遍开展了整党、整团工作。对阶级立场模糊、受富农思想影响的党员干部，进行了自我揭发和批判。对混入党内和合作社的地主、富农分子和其他政治面目不清的分子，坚决地进行了清洗。对富裕中农占据领导优势的农业合作社，也分别情况进行了调整和改组，增加了贫农骨干。
