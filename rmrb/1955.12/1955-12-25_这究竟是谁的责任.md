    To the Editor:

    In October of last year, the Wuxi City Grain Bureau of Jiangsu Province received a delivery notice from the Wuxi Railway Station, stating that a Polish-style T45 grain conveyor manufactured by the Guangzhou General Machinery Factory had arrived. The Grain Bureau immediately sent someone to the railway station's freight office to pick up the goods. During the handover, it was discovered that a rubber conveyor belt was missing; the comrades in the freight office said it would arrive later.

    Without the conveyor belt, the machine could not be used. The comrades in the Grain Bureau waited anxiously for a long time, and contacted the railway station's freight office several times, but the conveyor belt still did not arrive. The Grain Bureau then contacted the Guangzhou General Machinery Factory. The General Machinery Factory believed it may have been sent to the wrong place during loading and shipping, so they wrote to relevant departments to inquire, and also negotiated with the Guangzhou Railway Transport Business Office, but the whereabouts of the belt remained unknown.

    It wasn't until early August of this year that the Grain Bureau suddenly received a call from the Wuxi Railway Station's freight office saying that the conveyor belt had been found! It turned out that the belt had been mistakenly transported to Zhenjiang Railway Station and was only discovered during the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign. On September 17th, the conveyor belt was transported to the Wuxi City Grain Bureau, and the grain conveyor began to operate, able to replace the work of fifty workers every day. However, it had been shelved for nearly a year because it lacked the conveyor belt. Whose responsibility is this after all? Relevant railway departments should learn a lesson from this.

### 这究竟是谁的责任

    这究竟是谁的责任编辑同志：
    去年十月间，江苏省无锡市粮食局接到了无锡车站送来的一张取货通知单，说是广州通用机器厂发来的一部波兰式T45型粮食输送机运到了。粮食局马上派人到车站货运室去取货。在点交货物的时候，发现缺少了一条橡胶输送皮带；货运室的同志说是随后就可以运到。
    没有输送皮带，机器就不能使用。粮食局的同志焦急地等待了好久，并且几次同车站货运室联系，输送皮带还是没有运来。粮食局又同广州通用机器厂联系。通用机器厂认为可能是装车发运的时候发错了，就写信到有关方面查询，又同广州铁路运输营业所交涉，但是这条皮带的下落仍然不明。
    一直到今年八月初，粮食局忽然接到无锡车站货运室的电话说，输送皮带找到了！原来这条皮带被错运到镇江车站，直到增产节约运动中才被发现。九月十七日，这条输送皮带运到无锡市粮食局，粮食输送机开始发挥了效能，每天可以代替五十个工人的工作。但是，它过去因为没有输送皮带而被搁置了将近一年。这究竟是谁的责任呢？有关铁路部门应当从这里吸取教训。宋瑞生
