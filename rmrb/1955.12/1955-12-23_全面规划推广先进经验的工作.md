    Comprehensively Plan to Promote Advanced Experience
    Kong Sang
    Recently, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory formulated a preliminary plan for promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet outstanding lathe operator, Fyodorov. According to the arrangement of this preliminary plan, after the comprehensive promotion of Fyodorov's advanced experience next year, if the level of saving auxiliary man-hours can reach half of Fyodorov's level, the productivity of the factory's lathe operators can be increased by 13.5 percent, and more than one million yuan of wealth can be created for the country throughout the year.
    Comprehensively planning the work of promoting advanced experience is an important measure to improve the work of promoting advanced experience. In recent years, although China's industrial and mining enterprises have promoted many Soviet and Chinese advanced experiences, which have played a significant role in ensuring the comprehensive completion of the state plan, there are still many shortcomings in the work of promoting advanced experience. One of the main shortcomings is the lack of comprehensive planning. Often, it is hot and cold, enthusiastic in the west and indifferent in the east. When the tasks are tight, advanced experience is emphasized; when a certain link is weak, advanced experience in that link is emphasized. After the event, it slowly relaxes. This kind of "gust of wind" style of promoting advanced experience may overcome temporary difficulties in production, but it cannot consolidate advanced experience in practical application, popularize it, improve the technology of enterprises to a new level, and achieve a lasting and universal surge in labor productivity.
    The high tide of agricultural cooperation in our country has arrived, and the work of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has also entered a new stage. The people of the whole country are stepping up their efforts to build a socialist society. Under this new situation, industrial and mining enterprises must also speed up, not only to ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan, but also to strive to complete the state plan ahead of schedule and in excess. What do we rely on to complete the state plan ahead of schedule and in excess? The most important thing is to promote advanced experience. For example, organizing rapid steelmaking in the steelmaking industry, so that the smelting time of all open-hearth furnace workshops reaches the advanced level of furnaces of the same capacity and type, can produce more than 100,000 tons of steel annually simply due to the shortening of the smelting time.
    Comprehensively planning the work of promoting advanced experience means considering which advanced experiences are applicable to one's own department, proposing a comprehensive promotion plan and technical organizational measures, and organizing all employees to implement them. Although the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory's preliminary plan for promoting Fyodorov's advanced experience is limited to the scope of lathe operators and does not include the production of forging and casting workers, it is not a complete comprehensive plan for the factory's production as a whole. However, it is absolutely necessary and correct for them to plan the work of promoting advanced experience. At present, various industrial departments are planning the work of promoting advanced experience, and various industrial and mining enterprises should also take active action, check the work of promoting advanced experience, and make a plan for promoting advanced experience in 1956.

    全面规划推广先进经验的工作　
    孔桑
    最近，太原矿山机器厂制定了一个推广苏联优秀旋工费奥多洛夫的先进经验的初步规划。根据这个初步规划的安排，明年全面推广费奥多洛夫的先进经验之后，只要节省辅助工时的水平能达到费奥多洛夫的水平的一半，全厂车工的生产率就可以提高百分之十三点五，全年可以为国家多创造一百多万元财富。
    全面地规划推广先进经验的工作，是把推广先进经验的工作提高一步的重要措施。几年来，我国工矿企业虽然推广了很多苏联的和我国的先进经验，对保证全面完成国家计划起了很大的作用。但是推广先进经验的工作也还有许多缺点，其中最主要的缺点之一就是没有全面规划。常常是忽冷忽热，西冷东热，任务紧了，抓一下先进经验，哪个环节弱了，抓一下哪个环节的先进经验，事过境迁就慢慢松弛下来，这种“一阵风”式的推广先进经验，虽然可能克服生产中一时一事的困难，但是不能使先进经验在实际运用中巩固起来，普及开来，不能把企业的技术提高到新的水平，使劳动生产率达到持久的、普遍的高涨。
    我国农业合作化的高潮已经来到，对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的工作也已经进入一个新的阶段，全国人民正加紧努力为建设社会主义社会而奋斗。在这个新的形势下面，工矿企业也必须加快速度，不但要保证全面完成国家计划，而且一定要争取提前和超额完成国家计划。靠什么提前和超额完成国家计划呢？最主要的，也就是靠推广先进经验。例如在炼钢工业中组织快速炼钢，使所有平炉车间的熔炼时间达到同容量、同类型炉子中的先进水平，仅仅由于熔炼时间的缩短，每年就可以多生产十多万吨钢。
    全面规划推广先进经验的工作，就是考虑有那些先进经验适用于自己这个部门，提出全面推广的计划和技术组织措施，组织全体职工付诸实现。太原矿山机器厂推广费奥多洛夫先进经验的初步规划，虽然只限于车工这一范围，还不包括锻工、铸工的生产，就全厂的生产来说，还不是一个完整的全面规划，但是他们把推广先进经验的工作加以规划，却是完全必要的、正确的。现在各个工业部门正在规划推广先进经验的工作，各个工矿企业也应该积极行动起来，检查推广先进经验的工作，做出一九五六年推广先进经验的规划。
