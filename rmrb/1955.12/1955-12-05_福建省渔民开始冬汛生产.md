Fujian Fishermen Begin Winter Fishing Season Production

The winter fishing season has arrived on the Fujian coast, and tens of thousands of fishermen are setting sail to sea, casting nets and lines to catch fish and shrimp. In the Sansha fishing ground of Xiapu County, 60,000 jin of hairtail were caught in one day, November 22nd. In Dongshan County, more than 20 large trawlers caught more than 30,000 jin of sea bream in seven or eight voyages, which is more than 60% of the county's total winter fishing season sea bream production last year. Encouraged by the high tide of cooperativization, the fishermen's enthusiasm for production is particularly high. They have already received more than one million yuan in winter fishing season loans from the state, added a large number of fishing gear, exchanged fishing techniques, and, under the protection of the People's Liberation Army coastal defense forces and militiamen, the number of people going to sea has greatly exceeded that of previous years. According to statistics from Pingtan, Changle, and Lianjiang counties alone, the number of fishing boats going to sea has increased by more than 20% compared with the same period last year.

    福建省渔民开始冬汛生产
    冬季渔汛已来到福建沿海，成千上万渔民正扬帆出海，撒网放钓捕捉鱼虾。霞浦县三沙渔场在十
  一月二十二日一天内就捕到带鱼六万斤，东山县二十多只大?船出海七八次捕到鲷鱼三万多斤，相当去年全县冬汛鲷鱼产量百分之六十以上。在合作化高潮的鼓舞下，渔民们生产积极性特别高涨，他们已经得到国家冬汛贷款一百多万元，大量添置渔具，交流捕鱼技术，在解放军海防部队和民兵保护下，出海人数大大超过往年，仅平潭、长乐、连江三县统计，出海渔船就比去年同期增加百分之二十以上。
