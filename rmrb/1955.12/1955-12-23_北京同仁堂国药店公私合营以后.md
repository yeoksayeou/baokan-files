Beijing Public-Private Partnership Tongrentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop has completed the state's production value plan one month ahead of schedule.

It has only been a little over a year since Tongrentang became a public-private partnership. Compared to before the partnership, production value has increased by 32 percent, sales have increased by 16 percent, management fees have decreased by 21 percent, costs have decreased by 8 percent, and labor productivity has increased by 40 percent. They have also established purchasing and sales relationships with more than 90 state-owned companies and medical units. This is unprecedented in Tongrentang's history.

Tongrentang was established during the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty and has a history of 287 years. The medicines it produces enjoy a high reputation in China; however, before the public-private partnership, there were many problems within the enterprise. There were no fixed quality standards for the production of prepared medicines. Tongrentang produced more than 140 kinds of honey-refined pills. There were no standards for how much honey should be added to a pound of medicinal powder, and there was no production plan. Manufacturing workers could go to the warehouse to collect medicinal materials to make whatever pills they wanted that day. More than 50 kinds of medicinal materials and drugs in the warehouse had been stockpiled for more than ten years, and the elephant skin stored 30 years ago was enough to use for 60 years.

Last August, the state accepted the company's application and officially approved the implementation of a public-private partnership. After the partnership, a series of reforms were carried out in the organization and production of the enterprise. Three workshops were established for pharmaceutical manufacturing, wax casing, and cutting. Each department carried out production according to the state's plan. Pill-making machines, mixers, and pulverizers were also added, gradually replacing manual production with mechanized production, which improved the quality of prepared medicines.

Due to the internal reforms of the enterprise, the workers' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. Over the past year, 22 labor models have emerged, and 130 people have won first and second prizes. Product loss rates have generally decreased. Tiger bone wine decreased from 1.9 percent to 0.27 percent; output has generally increased, with the number of pills made per person per hour increasing from over 200 to over 600. Workers have put forward more than ten kinds of rationalization proposals in the pharmaceutical manufacturing aspect alone. Old worker Li Dongchen, who has been researching ginseng and deer antler, had always been unwilling to pass on his knowledge to others. Now he has written a booklet entitled "Ginseng and Deer Antler," recording his valuable experience of decades without reservation. Old worker Zhang Ming created a milling wheel pulverizer for pressing antelope horns, which increased work efficiency by more than three times and saved the state 9,500 yuan.

The Party and Communist Youth League organizations of this enterprise have absorbed a group of activists to join the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached Picture)

### 北京同仁堂国药店公私合营以后

    北京同仁堂国药店公私合营以后
    北京公私合营同仁堂国药店已经提前一个月完成了国家的产值计划。
    同仁堂公私合营仅有一年多的时间。合营以后同合营以前比较，产值增长了百分之三十二，销售额增长了百分之十六，管理费降低了百分之二十一，成本降低了百分之八，劳动生产率增长了百分之四十。他们还和九十多个国营公司、医疗单位建立了购销关系。这是同仁堂历史上从来没有过的事。
    同仁堂成立在清朝康熙年间，已经有二百八十七年的历史。它生产的药品，在国内享有很高的信誉；但是在公私合营以前，企业的内部存在着许多问题，成药的制作没有一定质量标准，同仁堂蜜制丸药有一百四十多种。一斤药面究竟应该放多少蜜都没有标准，生产也没有计划，制药工人今天想制什么丸药，就到仓库去领药料。仓库积压的药料药品中有五十多种可用十年以上，三十年以前存的象皮，还够用六十年。
    去年八月，国家接受了这个企业的申请，正式批准实行公私合营。合营以后，在企业的组织和生产上进行了一系列的改革，成立了制药、蜡皮、裁切三个车间，各部门按照国家的计划进行生产。还添置了制丸机、搅拌机、粉碎机，逐渐用机器代替手工生产，提高了成药质量。
    由于企业内部的革新，工人的生产积极性大大提高，一年来涌现出二十二个劳动模范，一百三十个人获得一等和二等奖。产品损耗率普遍下降，虎骨酒由百分之一点九降为零点二七；产量普遍增长，丸药每人每小时从捻二百多丸增加到六百多丸。工人们提出的合理化建议仅制药方面就有十多种。对人参和鹿茸素有研究的老工人李栋臣，过去一直不肯把这方面的知识传授给别人，现在他已经写成了一本“人参、鹿茸”的小册子，把几十年来宝贵的经验毫无保留地记载下来。老工人张铭，创造了压羚羊角的铣轮粉碎机，使工作效力提高三倍多，为国家节约了九千五百元。
    这个企业的党和青年团组织已经吸收了一批积极分子参加中国共产党和青年团。　（新华社）（附图片）
