Your telegram of November 30th has been received. Our three organizations are very grateful for your wise suggestion to break the deadlock that delayed the departure of the "Xingan Maru." We have repeatedly made maximum efforts to get Mr. Hong Jinshan on board the "Xingan Maru" this time, but we regret that we have not succeeded. Further, in accordance with the wishes expressed in your above-mentioned telegram, we have consulted with our government to obtain assurances for Mr. Hong and the other four to return to China in the near future according to their wishes, and the result has led us to believe that we have obtained such assurances. Therefore, we hereby undertake to your association the responsibility for achieving this. Based on the above, we will explain the situation to the overseas Chinese in Japan so that those who are willing to return to China can board the ship as soon as possible, and the "Xingan Maru" can depart as soon as possible.
