    Eight Thousand Agricultural Technology Extension Stations Established Nationwide
    (Our Newspaper News) With the high tide of agricultural cooperation arriving, agricultural technology extension stations have developed rapidly. To date, eight thousand agricultural technology extension stations have been established nationwide, employing nearly fifty thousand people. This represents an increase of more than three thousand five hundred agricultural technology extension stations and over fourteen thousand employees compared to 1954. Currently, more than 40% of rural districts across the country have agricultural technology extension stations, and districts in Liaoning Province and suburban areas of cities like Beijing and Shanghai now have stations in every district.
    These agricultural technology extension stations have played a significant role in increasing agricultural production. This year, the Liaoning Provincial Agricultural Technology Extension Station promoted the inoculation of soybean and peanut seeds with Rhizobium inoculant on 300,000 hectares of land, resulting in an average yield increase of 15 to 40 percent per hectare. In the past, farmers in Niantou Township, Dali County, Shaanxi Province, could only grow one crop of wheat per year due to a lack of fertilizer. This year, with the help of the Niantou Agricultural Technology Extension Station, they developed new fertilizer sources and planted an additional 1700 mu of late corn, resulting in an increased grain production of more than 100,000 jin for the township. Dali County plans to vigorously promote this multiple cropping measure in 1956. This year, seedling shortages were severe in cotton fields in Bahe District, Xishui County, Hubei. With the help of the agricultural technology extension station, over a hundred agricultural production cooperatives in the district replanted and carried out multiple pest control measures, resulting in an average yield of 45 jin of ginned cotton per mu for over 15,000 mu of cotton fields.
    Agricultural technology extension stations in various locations have changed their past generalized work methods and now largely rely on agricultural production cooperatives in their work. They provide technical guidance tailored to local conditions, classifying and dividing areas, and summarizing and promoting the production increase experiences of the local masses. This year, the forty-two agricultural technology extension stations in Fujian Province summarized the advanced production increase experiences of the masses and wrote sixty-five special reports, which played a significant role in guiding improvements in cultivation techniques throughout the province. The Dujiashigou and other agricultural technology extension stations in Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, summarized thirteen soil and water conservation experiences of the masses and promoted them throughout the county, reversing the severe phenomenon of soil erosion in the past. The thirteen agricultural technology extension stations in the eight counties of Beizhen, Panshan, and Tai'an in Liaoning Province also selected sixty-five excellent folk varieties. The "Lao Gu Zuo" sorghum variety selected by the Sixth District Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Beizhen County increased production by 40 percent compared to the locally commonly planted "Da She Yan" and other sorghum varieties. Agricultural technology extension stations in various locations have also established mass-based technical organizations and widely conducted technical instruction by signing "package teaching and learning" contracts with the Communist Youth League organizations, cultivating and training a large number of farmer technicians. Liaoning Province alone has trained 100,000 farmer technical backbones and also trained over one million farmer technicians through technical networks, powerfully promoting the work of agricultural technology reform.
    In order to adapt to the high tide of agricultural cooperation and the great development of agricultural production, various localities have accelerated the development speed of agricultural technology extension stations. Sixteen provinces and cities including Guangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hebei, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Tianjin have revised their plans for developing agricultural technology extension stations, aiming to complete the task of one station per district in 1956, which is one to two years faster than the original plan for developing agricultural technology extension stations. Other provinces are also actively creating conditions to strive for early completion. By the end of 1956, all districts in the country, except for a few frontier provinces and autonomous regions, will have agricultural technology extension stations.

    全国建立农业技术推广站八千处
    本报讯　随着农业合作化的高潮到来，农业技术推广站有了迅速的发展。到现在为止，全国已建立八千处农业技术推广站，有职工近五万名，比一九五四年增加了三千五百多处农业技术推广站，增加职工一万四千多人。现在全国百分之四十以上的农村区都有了农业技术推广站，辽宁省和北京、上海等市郊区已区区有站。
    这些农业技术推广站对农业增产起了很大作用。辽宁省农业技术推广站今年向农民推广了三十万垧用根瘤菌粉拌种的大豆、花生，平均每垧增产了百分之十五至四十。陕西省大荔县埝头乡农民过去由于缺少肥料，一年只种一季小麦，今年在埝头农业技术推广站帮助下，开辟了肥源，多种了一季晚玉米一千七百多亩，全乡因此多增产十万多斤粮食。大荔县计划一九五六年大力推广多种一季的增产措施。湖北浠水县巴河区今年棉花缺苗情况严重。在农业技术推广站的帮助下，全区一百多个农业生产合作社进行了补种和多次除虫，使一万五千多亩棉田平均产量达到四十五斤皮棉。
    各地农业技术推广站改变了过去一般化的工作方法，在工作中大都依靠农业生产合作社，因地制宜、分类分区地进行技术指导，并总结和推广了当地群众增产经验。今年福建省四十二处农业技术推广站就总结了群众先进增产经验写成六十五篇专题报告，对指导全省改进耕作技术方面起了很大作用。陕西省米脂县杜家石沟等农业技术推广站总结了十三条群众的水土保持经验，在全县范围内推广，改变了过去水土流散的严重现象。辽宁省北镇、盘山、台安等八个县的十三个农业技术推广站还评选出民间优良品种六十五种。北镇县六区农业技术推广站选出的“老鹄坐”高粱良种，比当地普遍种植的“大蛇眼”等种类高粱增产百分之四十。各地农业技术推广站还建立了群众性的技术组织，普遍地通过同青年团组织订立了“包教保学”合同进行技术传授，培养训练了大批农民技术手，仅辽宁省就培养了十万名农民技术骨干，还通过技术网训练了一百多万名农民技术人员，有力地推动了农业技术改革工作。
    为了适应农业合作化的高潮和农业生产的大发展，各地都加快了农业技术推广站的发展速度。广西、山东、河南、湖北、河北、吉林、黑龙江、甘肃、安徽、浙江、福建、广东、天津等十六个省市，都重新修改了发展农业技术推广站的计划，将在一九五六年完成一区一站的任务，比原计划发展农业技术推广站的速度，快了一年到两年。其余各省也正在积极创造条件，争取提早完成。到一九五六年底，全国除少数边疆省、自治区外，都可以区区有农业技术推广站。
