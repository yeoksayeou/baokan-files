Khrushchev, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru signed a joint statement on December 13th at the Presidential Palace in India.

At the time of signing, the Soviet side was represented by: Nikolai A. Bulganin, Nikolai S. Khrushchev and their entourage, as well as Soviet Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to India, M.A. Menshikov.

The Indian side was represented by: Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Secretary-General of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, N.R. Pillai, Secretary of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, S. Dutt, Director of Protocol of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, M.R.A. Baig, and Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, K.P.S. Menon.

Representatives of the press from India, the Soviet Union and other countries were also present at the signing.

The full text of the joint statement is as follows:

The Prime Minister of India visited the Soviet Union in June 1955 at the invitation of the Soviet government. The Prime Minister of India was warmly received in the Soviet Union, and this visit strengthened the friendship and mutual understanding between the people of India and the Soviet Union. At the end of the visit, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Prime Minister of India issued a joint statement on June 22, 1955.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Nikolai A. Bulganin, and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Nikolai S. Khrushchev, visited India from November to December 1955 at the invitation of the Indian government, accompanied by other Soviet government officials. They were warmly welcomed by the people of this country everywhere. Their visit strengthened the friendship between the two countries and the two peoples. Nikolai A. Bulganin and Nikolai S. Khrushchev visited various construction projects in agriculture, industry and water conservancy, as well as agricultural revitalization areas, state farms and other centers of economic development in India.

The visit of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Nikolai A. Bulganin, and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Nikolai S. Khrushchev, to India, and the visit of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to the Soviet Union, gave them the opportunity to personally understand the people of these two countries and their way of life, to understand the problems, achievements and aspirations of the two countries, and enabled them and the people of their two countries to reach mutual understanding on the basis of mutual respect, goodwill and tolerance.

The aforementioned joint statement, published on June 22, 1955, expressed the unwavering sincerity of both parties towards the Five Principles, namely Panchsheel.

According to these principles, countries with different, political social and economic systems can, and should, cooperate with each on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs, and jointly implement a policy of active peaceful coexistence to achieve the ideal of peace and the improvement of human living conditions.

Since the announcement of these Five Principles, many countries have declared that they adhere to these principles, or have expressed their agreement with these principles. The countries attending the Bandung Conference unanimously adopted a declaration affirming that the Five Principles, which have now been widely recognized, are a solid foundation for cooperation between countries.

During the visit of Nikolai A. Bulganin and Nikolai S. Khrushchev to India, they and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru exchanged views freely and frankly on various issues of the international situation. The result of the exchange of views confirmed their firm belief: international relations should be based on the Five Principles, and every effort should be made to ease international tensions, promote the consolidation of peace and cooperation between countries.

The summit conference held in Geneva in July 1955 led the major countries attending the meeting to recognize that war is meaningless, and that due to the development of atomic and hydrogen weapons, war can only bring misfortune to mankind.

The fundamental idea of abandoning war as a means of resolving international disputes has been warmly supported by the people of the world and has greatly eased tensions. Although the major problems in Europe and Asia remain to be resolved, the abandonment of war as a means of resolving disputes has naturally changed the attitude towards these problems and has generated a desire to resolve these problems through negotiations. Diplomatic relations have been established between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. Ambassadorial-level talks between the United States and the People's Republic of China have begun and are continuing. The Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy was successfully concluded in August this year, and the United Nations General Assembly has adopted a resolution on the establishment of an international atomic energy agency.

In order to further resolve various disputes through negotiations, the summit conference of the four countries held in Geneva in July this year pointed out that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries must be convened. The meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries was held in Geneva not long ago. This meeting failed to reach an agreement on the issues discussed, and therefore the great hopes generated by the summit conference of the four countries have not been realized. However, the meeting gave everyone a clearer understanding of the problems facing the world, and the irrefutable fact is that to prevent war, as everyone recognizes, all these problems can only be resolved peacefully, through peaceful negotiations.

Therefore, the disappointment with the results of the Geneva meeting of the four foreign ministers can only be temporary. All efforts must continue to be made to ease international tensions and to regard negotiations as the only way to resolve disputes. Government officials of both countries expressed the hope that the ambassadorial-level talks between the United States and the People's Republic of China will not only lead to the resolution of the issues they are discussing, but will also achieve broader mutual understanding through higher-level meetings. They believe that there can be no lasting peace in Asia without granting the People's Republic of China its legitimate status in the United Nations. They deeply regret the delay in recognizing this undeniable fact.

Both sides sincerely hope that the Far East and other issues in Asia will be resolved without delay through agreement, namely that the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China to the coastal islands and the island of Taiwan should be met, and that the Korean issue should be resolved in the interests of peace in the Far East on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the Korean people.

The state leaders of the Soviet Union and the Prime Minister of India welcomed last year's Geneva conference on the Indochina issue. This conference ended the destructive Indochina War and formulated procedures for resolving the Indochina issue.

They regret to note that obstacles have arisen in the implementation of the Geneva agreements on Vietnam, and that there are also difficulties in the implementation of the Geneva agreements on Laos.

Violations of these agreements will have very serious consequences for Indochina and the world. Therefore, the state leaders of both countries are willing to make a request to all countries participating in the agreement and relevant parties: to remove the obstacles currently hindering the true implementation of the Geneva agreements, and to cooperate in fulfilling the letter and spirit of these agreements.

They are convinced that universal principles should be adopted on the issue of membership of the United Nations. The United Nations cannot represent all the countries in the world until this principle is fulfilled. Therefore, they welcome the proposal put forward by the United Nations General Assembly to admit eighteen countries to the United Nations at the same time, and sincerely hope that this proposal will soon be adopted and implemented by the Security Council.

If we are to establish world peace and eliminate the conditions that lead to the devastating destruction of a new world war, there is no other way but disarmament. Increasing armaments, or even maintaining existing armament levels, is a constant threat of war, a cause of fear and the race to produce the latest types of weapons of mass destruction. The urgent necessity of disarmament is increasing proportionally with the invention and accumulation of weapons with ever-increasing destructive power. The universal desire to completely eliminate war requires active, constructive and rapid steps in disarmament. A large measure of agreement has already been reached on this issue. It is clear that if the goal is to establish lasting peace, there is no reason not to quickly overcome the remaining obstacles.

The state leaders of both countries especially wish to once again express their firm conviction: the production, use and testing of nuclear weapons and thermonuclear weapons should be unconditionally prohibited. At the same time, conventional armaments must be drastically reduced, and effective international supervision must be established to ensure the strict implementation of this prohibition of weapons and disarmament. Until this is achieved, the whole world will be under a cloud, suffering from the fear of war, and people will doubt the sincerity of the pursuit of peace.

The state leaders of the Soviet Union and the Prime Minister of India agreed that the establishment of military alliances or regional military blocs is not a way to guarantee peace and security. Such alliances expand the scope of the "Cold War," bring instability to the regions concerned, increase the atmosphere of fear and tension, and create additional obstacles to the peaceful development of the countries concerned. Peace and the true security of all peoples can only be guaranteed through the collective efforts of all countries.

One of the most effective ways to eliminate the atmosphere of fear and tension in international relations is to eliminate obstacles to mutual cooperation and mutual understanding. To achieve this goal, cultural and economic ties between countries should be encouraged.

The state leaders of both countries noted with satisfaction that through the frequent mutual visits of scientists, technicians, economists, parliamentarians, writers and other cultural workers of the two countries, the people of the two countries have had increasing opportunities to better understand each other. They hope that, on the basis of promoting understanding and respect for the different ways of life of the two countries, these opportunities for mutual contact will continue to expand.

Therefore, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, the Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and the Prime Minister of India welcome the fact that cooperation between the two countries is developing in the construction of a steel plant in the Bhilai region of India and in the implementation of other plans that have been negotiated. India, which attaches great importance to the development of heavy industry, and its second five-year plan, will provide further opportunities for this cooperation between the two countries.

They believe that it is appropriate for qualified representatives of the two countries to meet, after the necessary preparations have been completed, in order to discuss what mutually beneficial ways can be used to implement economic and technical cooperation in the future, and to reach agreement on specific issues that everyone deems necessary to reach agreement on.

The visit of Nikolai A. Bulganin and Nikolai S. Khrushchev to India is an event of extraordinary importance, not only because it has brought the two countries closer, but also because it has contributed to the cause of universal peace. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Nikolai A. Bulganin, the Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Nikolai S. Khrushchev, and the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, reiterated their confidence in the future and expressed their determination to contribute their strength to the cause of consolidating peace, which is beneficial not only to the people of their two countries, but also to the people of the world.

Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Nikolai A. Bulganin

Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru

    布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫同尼赫鲁发表联合声明
    新华社新德里十四日电　苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和印度总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁十二月十三日在印度总统府签署了一项联合声明。
    签字的时候，苏联方面在场的有：尼·亚·布尔加宁、尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和他们的随行人员以及苏联驻印度特命全权大使米·阿·曼希科夫。
    印度方面在场的有：印度总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁、印度外交部秘书长纳·鲁·皮莱、印度外交部秘书斯·杜特、印度外交部礼宾司司长麦·拉·阿·巴伊格、印度驻苏联大使克·普·西·梅农。
    签字时在场的还有印度、苏联和其他国家新闻界的代表。
    联合声明全文如下：
    印度总理应苏联政府的邀请，在一九五五年六月访问了苏联。印度总理在苏联受到热烈的接待，这次访问巩固了印苏两国人民之间的友谊和互相了解。在访问结束的时候，苏联部长会议主席和印度总理在一九五五年六月二十二日发表了联合声明。
    苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫应印度政府的邀请，在苏联其他政府人员的随同下，在一九五五年十一月到十二月访问了印度。这个国家的人民到处热烈地欢迎他们。他们的访问加强了两个国家和两国人民之间的友谊。尼·亚·布尔加宁和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫参观了农业、工业和水利工程的各项建设，以及农业复兴地区、国营农场和印度其他经济发展的中心。
    苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫访问印度和印度总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁访问苏联，使他们有机会亲自了解这两国的人民和他们的生活方式，了解两国的问题、成就和愿望，并且使他们和他们两国人民能够在互相尊重、善意和容忍的基础上达成了相互谅解。
    一九五五年六月二十二日公布的上述联合声明表现了双方对五项原则，即潘查希拉的不可动摇的诚意。
    根据这些原则，政治、社会、经济制度互不相同的国家可以而且应当在互相尊重、互不干涉内政的基础上实行合作，共同为实现和平和改善人的生活条件的理想而实行积极的和平共处的政策。
    自从这五项原则宣布以来，许多国家声明它们奉行这些原则，或是对这些原则表示同意。出席万隆会议的国家一致通过一项宣言，肯定了现在已经获得广泛承认的五项原则是国与国之间合作的巩固基础。
    在尼·亚·布尔加宁和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫这次访问印度期间，他们和印度总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁之间就国际局势的各项问题无拘束地、坦率地交换了意见。交换意见的结果确定了他们的坚定的信念：国际关系应当以五项原则为基础，应当尽一切可能来缓和国际紧张局势，促进和平的巩固和国与国之间的合作。
    一九五五年七月在日内瓦举行的政府首脑会议使出席会议的大国承认了战争是无意义的，由于原子武器和氢武器的发展，战争只能给人类带来不幸。
    摈弃把战争作为解决国际争端的手段这种基本看法，受到了世界人民热烈的拥护，并且使得紧张局势大大缓和。虽然欧洲和亚洲的主要问题还有待解决，但是，由于摈弃把战争作为解决争端的手段，很自然地就改变了对待这些问题的态度，并且产生了要求通过谈判方式解决这些问题的愿望。苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间已经建立了外交关系。美国和中华人民共和国两国之间的大使级会谈已经开始并且正在继续进行。和平利用原子能会议已经在今年八月间圆满结束，而联合国大会已经通过了关于建立原子能国际机构的决议。
    为了通过谈判进一步解决各项争端，今年七月在日内瓦举行的四国政府首脑会议指出必须召开四国外交部长会议。四国外交部长会议不久前已经在日内瓦举行。这次会议没有能够就所讨论的问题达成协议，因而四国政府首脑会议所产生的巨大希望还没有得到实现。但是，会议使大家对世界面临的问题有了更清楚的了解，而确定不移的事实是：要像大家所公认的那样制止战争，所有这些问题只能用和平方式，通过和平谈判来加以解决。
    因此，对日内瓦四国外交部长会议结果的失望只能是暂时的。必须继续竭尽一切努力来缓和国际紧张局势，把谈判当作解决争执问题的唯一方法。两国的政府人士表示希望：美国和中华人民共和国两国之间的大使级会谈，将不仅使得他们所讨论的问题得到解决，而且还将通过更高级的会议达到更广泛的相互谅解。他们相信，不给予中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位，亚洲就不可能有持久的和平。对于拖延承认这个无可争辩的事实，他们感到深深的遗憾。
    双方真诚希望：远东和亚洲的其他问题将通过协议而毫不拖延地得到解决，这些问题就是：中华人民共和国对于沿海岛屿和台湾岛的合法权利应当得到满足，朝鲜问题应当在承认朝鲜人民的民族权利的基础上，按照远东和平的利益求得解决。
  苏联的国家领导人员和印度总理曾对去年在日内瓦举行的关于印度支那问题的会议表示欢迎。这次会议结束了破坏性的印度支那战争，并且拟订了解决印度支那国家问题的程序。
    他们很遗憾地指出，在实行关于越南问题的日内瓦协议方面发生了障碍，而实行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议也有困难。
    违反这些协议将对印度支那和全世界造成非常严重的后果。因此，两国的国家领导人员愿意向一切参加协议的国家和有关方面提出要求：排除目前横梗在真正实行日内瓦协议的道路上的障碍，并且通力合作来履行这些协定的文字和精神。
    他们深信，在联合国会员国资格问题上应当采取普遍的原则。这个原则一天不能履行，联合国就一天不能代表全世界的国家。因此，他们欢迎联合国大会提出的关于同时接纳十八个国家参加联合国的建议，并且真诚地希望这个建议不久将被安全理事会采纳并且实行。
    要想建立世界和平，消除导致新的世界战争的毁灭性破坏的条件，除了裁军的道路以外，没有别的道路。增加军备或者甚至是维持现有的军备水平，都是经常的战争威胁，是恐惧和竞相生产最新型大规模毁灭性武器的原因。裁军的迫切必要性随着破坏力越来越大的武器的发明和积存而成正比例地增长着。完全消除战争的普遍的愿望，要求在裁军方面采取积极的、建设性的和迅速的步骤。在这个问题上已经在很大程度上取得了一致意见。十分明显，如果以建立持久和平为目的，那么，就没有根据不把剩下的障碍迅速克服。
    两国的国家领导人员特别希望再一次表示自己的坚定信念：应当实现无条件地禁止生产、使用和试验核子武器和热核子武器。与此同时，必须大量裁减常规军备，建立有效的国际监督以保证这种武器的禁止和裁军的严格执行。在没有做到这点之前，整个世界将处在阴影笼罩之下，忍受战争恐惧的痛苦，人民将怀疑争取和平的诚意。
    苏联的国家领导人员和印度总理一致认为，建立军事联盟或者区域性的军事集团不是保障和平和安全的办法。这种联盟扩大了“冷战”的范围，为有关的地区带来了不稳定的因素，增加了恐惧和紧张的气氛，并且为有关国家的和平发展制造了额外的障碍。和平和各国人民的真正安全只有通过各国的集体努力才能得到保证。
    消除国际关系中恐惧和紧张气氛的最有效的途径之一，就是消除相互合作和相互了解方面的障碍。为了达到这个目的，应当鼓励各国之间建立文化和经济的联系。
  两国的国家领导人员满意地指出，通过两国的科学家、技术专家、经济学家、议员、作家和其他文化工作者的经常的相互访问，两国人民已经有越来越多的机会来更好地彼此了解。他们希望，在促进对两国不同生活方式的了解和尊重的基础上，这种互相接触的机会将不断扩大。
    因此，苏联部长会议主席、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员和印度总理欢迎在印度比莱地区建设炼钢厂方面和在实现已经进行谈判的其他计划方面两国之间的合作得到发展的事实。对重工业发展予以重视的印度，它的第二个五年计划，将为两国之间的这种合作提供进一步的机会。
    他们认为这样做是适宜的：在必要的准备工作完毕后，两国有资格的代表举行会晤，以便讨论今后用什么互利的方式来实行经济和技术合作，并且就大家认为有必要达成协议的具体问题达成协议。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫到印度的访问是异常重要的事件，这不仅是因为这次访问使两国接近起来，而且因为它有助于普遍和平的事业。苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和印度总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁重申他们对未来的信心，表示坚决要为不仅对他们两国人民有利，而且对全世界人民有利的巩固和平的事业贡献出自己的力量。
