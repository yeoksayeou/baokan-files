Observer's Commentary:

    The "Dead End" of American Policy

    On December 8th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech on foreign policy to the Illinois Manufacturers' Association in Chicago. In his speech, he unreservedly revealed the U.S.'s intention to continue the "Cold War" throughout the world.

    Shortly after the end of the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, under pressure from world opinion and the American people, Dulles had stated that "the spirit of Geneva still exists." He also said that although "the Cold War in the sense of a race for peace will inevitably continue," "we can hope that this race will not bring the kind of hostility and hatred that has damaged our relations in the past."

    However, the trend of international situation further developing in a peaceful direction after the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference made Dulles immediately abandon these pleasant words. He once again pulled out the stale clichés from the "Cold War" arsenal, trying to reverse the situation's development and obstruct the easing of international tensions.

    Dulles's speech makes one feel that he has forgotten that there was a Four-Power Summit in Geneva, that there was a "spirit of Geneva." His speech does not mention this meeting or this spirit at all. On the contrary, it is filled with the kind of wanton slander against the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies that Dulles used to utter frequently before the Geneva Conference. Dulles once again brandished his long-discredited magic weapon of the so-called "international communist threat," attempting to intimidate certain countries in the world and force them to adopt American policies as their own.

    Dulles announced that American policy includes two aspects: one is to establish military aggression systems like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the ANZUS Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Middle East Baghdad Treaty Organization, and the other is to strengthen the "ultimate deterrent." And these two are complementary. In Dulles's words, the military strength of these military systems themselves will be "reinforced by the U.S.'s more mobile deterrent." Dulles believes that the benefit of such so-called "common security arrangements" is that they can not only strike out at peaceful democratic countries, but also provide "strategies for maintaining internal order and preventing subversion," that is, so-called "local defense forces" to suppress the people of various countries.

    Dulles believes that military aggression systems plus an aggressive "deterrent force" constitute the "solid foundation" for the "peace" that the United States needs, and that "this foundation must be preserved intact." In this case, the disarmament that the people of the world urgently demand is something that the United States can absolutely not agree to.

    The outline of American policy depicted by Dulles is something that people have long known and contains nothing new. Facts have long proven that this kind of American policy is bound to lead to the division of the world, the creation of disputes, and the threat to peace. The United States has been following this path for the past ten years since the war, and will continue to follow this path in the future. Dulles explained this to American capitalists, obviously to reassure them that they need not fear that the emergence of the "spirit of Geneva" will reduce their profits.

    However, Dulles does not seem to have seriously considered where this path of "power politics" will lead the United States.

    After the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, there was much discussion in the United States about American foreign policy. Many relatively insightful political figures and commentators almost unanimously believed that the U.S.'s "power politics" had failed and that the time had come to change American foreign policy. For example, the famous American commentator Walter Lippmann wrote in the "New York Herald Tribune" on December 5th that "reassessment to make revisions and reinforcements in some aspects of our foreign policy has become necessary." He said, "We must restudy and debate some issues like our German policy and some aspects of our deterrent policy practiced in the Middle East and South Asia." Lippmann sharply pointed out, "Our position abroad has in fact deteriorated. ... If Mr. Dulles insists on his policies and past record, he will make a lifelong mistake."

    Elmer Davis, who served as the Deputy Director of the U.S. "Office of War Information" during World War II, also wrote in the "New York Times" not long ago that "our military containment policy has now reached the end of a dead end. The conditions that lead us to hope for the success of this policy no longer exist." Davis believes that the military blocs established by the United States in Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East are all "outdated." He called on the United States to change its policy, saying, "The answer should be what any rational person would do when he finds himself at the end of a dead end - back out or turn around."

    These arguments will certainly not have any impact on Dulles's bloated head. Dulles now indicates that he wants to continue down this dead end of "power politics."

    However, it would not be entirely true to say that Dulles has not realized that the future of "power politics" is not very good. He knows that there are infighting contradictions within the military blocs he has created, and that they are opposed by the people of various countries. Therefore, in his speech, he called on Western European countries to "continue to build their own unity." He also admitted that in Asia, because many countries have chosen "neutralism," the "gap" in the military aggression system organized by the United States has not yet been "plugged."

    Regarding this regrettable situation, Dulles believes that it can be resolved by relying on the use of pressure and monetary bribery. Therefore, in his speech, he demanded that the countries of the North Atlantic Group come up with a "sense of unity and concerted efforts" at the ministerial council to be held next week to "share" with the United States, and promised to be prepared to "support" "common institutions" such as the "Coal and Steel Community" "if there is an opportunity." Therefore, in his speech, he spoke at length about the so-called "economic and technical assistance" to "backward areas."

    Obviously realizing that the situation in Asia and Africa is developing rapidly in a direction unfavorable to American aggression, Dulles believes that in order to win over Asia, "public funds alone cannot solve the problem." He called on American monopoly capitalists to restore "the kind of vigorous spirit of the past," to make private investments in order to produce things and "share" them with the people of backward areas. The actual meaning of Dulles's remarks can be readily understood by recalling his recent statement in support of Portugal's colonial rule over Goa, India. It turns out that the "great purpose" of the United States is colonialism.

    However, relying on pressure and money, the United States has certainly not been able to solve any problems in the past, and will be even less able to solve any problems in the future. The people of all countries have increasingly realized that without the "leadership" imposed on them by the United States, without the "aid" that the United States has stuffed down their throats by various means, they can live more freely and happily. Under today's international situation, all of America's threats and inducements are becoming increasingly ineffective.

    The U.S.'s "power politics" is a dead end. Dulles has run into walls in this alley more than once, but he still wants to go in, and the result can only bring greater failure.

### 美国政策的“死胡同”

    美国政策的“死胡同”
    十二月八日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在芝加哥向伊利诺斯制造商协会发表了一篇外交政策演说。他在演说中毫不掩饰地表露了美国想要在全世界继续进行“冷战”的打算。
    在日内瓦四国外长会议结束以后不久，杜勒斯在世界舆论和美国人民的压力之下，曾经表示过“日内瓦精神仍然存在”。他还说，虽然“和平竞赛意义上的冷战将会不可避免地继续下去”，但是
  “我们可以希望这种竞赛无论如何将不会带来过去曾经损害我们之间的关系的那种敌视和仇恨”。
    然而四国外长会议以后国际局势进一步向和缓方向发展的趋势，却使得杜勒斯马上抛弃了这些动听的漂亮话，重新搬出“冷战”武器库里的那些发了霉的陈腔滥调，想这样来扭转局势的发展，阻挠国际局势的缓和。
    杜勒斯的演说使人觉得他已经忘记了世界上有过四国政府首脑会议，有过“日内瓦精神”。在他的演说中根本就一个字也没有提到这次会议和这种精神，倒是出现了在日内瓦会议以前经常挂在杜勒斯口头的那种对于苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的肆意诬蔑。杜勒斯又一次耍起了他那早就失灵了的所谓“国际共产主义威胁”的法宝，企图恫吓世界上某些国家，迫使它们把美国的政策当作自己的政策来执行。
    杜勒斯宣布，美国的政策包含两个方面，一个方面是建立像北大西洋公约集团、澳新美条约集团、东南亚条约集团、中东巴格达条约集团这样的军事侵略体系，另一个方面是加强“最后的威慑力量”。而这两者又是相辅相成的。用杜勒斯的话来说，这些军事体系本身的军事力量，将得到美国的“更机动的威慑力量的增援”。杜勒斯认为，这样的所谓“共同安全安排”的好处是不但可以向和平民主国家出击，而且可以提供“维护内部秩序防止颠覆策略”，也就是用来镇压各国人民的所谓“局部防御力量”。
    杜勒斯认为，军事侵略体系加上侵略性的“威慑力量”，就构成了美国所需要的“和平”的“坚实基础”，而现在“必须完整无损地保存这种基础”。既然这样，全世界人民所迫切要求的裁减军备就是美国所绝对不能同意的了。
    杜勒斯所描绘的美国政策的轮廓，是人们早就知道了的，没有任何新奇之处。事实早已证明，美国的这种政策必然要导向分裂世界、制造纷争、威胁和平。战后十年以来美国所走的就是这条道路，今后还是要走这条道路。杜勒斯向美国的资本家们说明这一点，显然是为了要他们不必害怕“日内瓦精神”的出现会使他们的利润减少。
    但是，杜勒斯似乎直到现在还没有很好想一想，这条“实力政策”的道路将把美国引到哪里去。
    在日内瓦四国外长会议以后，在美国出现了对于美国外交政策的纷纷议论。许多比较有见识的政治人物和评论员几乎一致认为，美国的“实力政策”已经失败，现在已经到了改变美国外交政策的时候了。例如，著名的美国评论员李普曼在十二月五日的“纽约先驱论坛报”上写道，“重新估计以便在我们外交政策的某些方面进行修改和加强已经成为必要了”。他说，“我们必须对像我们的德国政策和我们在中东和南亚实行的威慑政策的某些方面这样一些问题加以重新研究和辩论。”李普曼尖锐地指出，“我们在国外的地位事实上已经恶化了。……如果杜勒斯先生坚持他的政策和过去的记录，他将会犯终生的大错。”
    曾经在二次大战期间担任过美国“战时新闻局”副局长的华伯不久以前在“纽约时报”上也写道，“我们的军事遏制政策现在已经走到一条死胡同的尽头。导使我们希望这种政策成功的条件已经不再存在了。”华伯认为，美国在欧洲、中东和远东建立的军事集团都已经“过时”了。他要求美国改变政策，他说，“答案应当是任何一个有理性的人发现他自己是在死胡同的尽头时所要作的——倒退出来或者向后转。”
    这些议论当然不会对杜勒斯的发胀的头脑产生任何影响。杜勒斯现在表示，他要在这条“实力政策”的死胡同里走下去。
    然而，要说杜勒斯完全没有认识到“实力政策”的前途并不太妙，那倒也不尽然。他知道他搞的那些军事集团内部是存在着勾心斗角的矛盾的，是遭到各国人民反对的。因此他在演说中要求西欧国家“继续建立它们自己的团结”。他也承认，在亚洲，由于许多国家选择了“中立主义”，美国组织的军事侵略体系的“缺口”还没有能够“堵住”。
    对于这种令人遗憾的情形，杜勒斯认为依靠使用压力和金钱收买就可以解决。因此他在演说中要求北大西洋集团各国在下星期举行的部长理事会上拿出“团结和同心协力的感觉”来给美国“分享”，并且答应“有机会的话”准备“支持”像“煤钢联营集团”这样的“共同机构”。因此他在演说中大谈其援助“落后地区”的所谓“经济和技术援助”。
    显然因为认识到亚洲和非洲的局势正在急剧地朝向不利于美国侵略的一面发展，杜勒斯认为，要想笼络亚洲，“光靠公款也不能解决问题”，他要求美国的垄断资本家们恢复“过去的那种猛干精神”，进行私人投资，以便生产东西出来和落后地区的人民“共同享用”。杜勒斯这番话的实际意义是什么，只要回想一下前不久他支持葡萄牙对印度果阿的殖民统治的声明，人们就可以恍然大悟了。原来美国的“伟大的宗旨”就是殖民主义。
    但是，美国依靠压力和金钱，过去固然没有能够解决任何问题，今后更加解决不了任何问题。各国人民已经越来越认识到，没有美国强加在他们头上的“领导”，没有美国用各种手段硬塞给他们的
  “援助”，他们可以生活得更自由，更幸福。在今天的国际局势下面，美国的一切威胁利诱手段越来越不中用了。
    美国的“实力政策”是一条走不通的死胡同。杜勒斯在这条胡同里已经碰了不止一回壁，却仍然要往里面走，其结果只能带来更大的失败。
