　　(New China News Agency, Pyongyang, December 18th) According to the Korean Central News Agency: The Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea publicly tried Park Heon-young on December 15th, a traitor who had long served as a spy for American imperialism and attempted to subvert the Republic, and sentenced Park Heon-young to death according to law.

　　According to the decision of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, the presiding judge of the Special Tribunal was held by Vice Marshal of the Republic Choi Yong-kun. The assessors were Kim Ik-seon, the State Inspector General; Lim Hae, Chairman of the Inspection Committee of the Central Committee of the Labor Party; Fang Xueshi, Minister of Internal Affairs; and Zhao Chengmo, President of the Supreme Court. The courtroom was filled with people who came to observe.

　　After the Special Tribunal opened, it first read out the indictment. Based on conclusive facts, the indictment stated that Park Heon-young was the head of the Lee Seung-yeop and Lee Kang-guk traitorous gang, who were publicly tried and executed in 1953, and proved that American imperialism was the direct organizer of this incident.

　　The indictment pointed out that Park Heon-young met Underwood, a veteran American spy, in Seoul as early as 1919. In November 1925, Park Heon-young was arrested by the Japanese police and surrendered to the Japanese imperialists, exposing the secret organizations of the Korean Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, causing the organization's leading cadres to be arrested. From this time on, he became an enemy of the Korean people.

　　In October 1939, Park Heon-young met with American spy Underwood again and became an American spy. In December of the same year, Park Heon-young was instructed by Underwood to infiltrate the Korean revolutionary ranks, usurp leadership positions, and collect and provide secret intelligence.

　　After the "August 15th" liberation of Korea, Park Heon-young disguised himself as a "patriot," wooed some factional elements who betrayed and abandoned the revolution, and usurped the position of secretary of the Communist Party in South Korea.

　　At the end of September 1945, he held a secret meeting with Hodge, then commander of the U.S. military in South Korea, at the Peninsula Hotel in Seoul, and agreed to make the Communist Party obey the U.S. military government.

　　In November 1945, he held another secret meeting with Hodge and Underwood and received instructions from Hodge. Since then, Park Heon-young, according to this instruction, created various crimes aimed at weakening and paralyzing the party's combat strength and strangling the patriotic and democratic forces in South Korea. In February 1946, he secretly met with Hodge again, and then met twice more, providing Hodge with information about the entire organizational system of the Communist Party from the central to the local level and its activities, historical information, the organizational system of mass organizations under the leadership of the Party, a list of cadres, the policy of the democratic united front, and the Party's attitude towards the Soviet-American Joint Committee.

　　In March 1946, Park Heon-young, according to Hodge's instructions, placed the traitorous bandits Lee Seung-yeop and Zhao Il-ming in important positions in the Party and guided and guaranteed their espionage activities. From March 1946 to September 1947, Park Heon-young instructed Lee Seung-yeop and Zhao Il-ming to provide the U.S. military with important secrets of the Party six times. In early October of the same year, Park Heon-young, under Hodge's instructions, entered North Korea.

　　After entering North Korea, Park Heon-young successively allowed Lee Seung-yeop and Lee Kang-guk, directly dispatched by Hodge, and An Young-da and Baek Hyung-bok, spies dispatched by Nichols, an aviation intelligence officer of the U.S. Far East Command, to infiltrate the Party and state organs and usurp important positions. In the spring of 1949, Park Heon-young, under Hodge's instructions, also allowed American spies Henry Ellis and Lee Sa-min to enter the Republic and assume important positions. During this period, Park Heon-young also passed important decisions and confidential materials of the North Korean Labor Party to Hodge through Lee Seung-yeop. Under Park Heon-young's protection, Lee Kang-guk provided the U.S. military intelligence agency with information on the strength and deployment of the People's Army and the police force, as well as confidential documents such as the organization of the North Korean People's Committee and the state budget, five times.

　　After Hodge returned to the United States, Park Heon-young continued to operate under the instructions of Noble, a political advisor at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, and Park Heon-young and Lee Seung-yeop also met with Noble together.

　　After American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, Park Heon-young frantically created crimes that weakened the power of the Republic and attempted to cause the Republic to fail. In 1950, after the People's Army liberated Seoul, Lee Seung-yeop and Park Heon-young conspired to organize a secret murder group, adding the crime of "defection" and "espionage suspicion" to those who discovered their treasonous crimes and killing them.

　　In September 1951, Park Heon-young, along with Lee Seung-yeop, Bae Cheol, and others, secretly gathered to discuss plans to coordinate with the anticipated enemy's military offensive and carry out an armed rebellion to subvert the Party and government, and formed an armed rebellion command. They attempted to use Gyeonggi-do, centered on Kaesong, as a counter-revolutionary base. In September 1952, these traitorous bandits secretly gathered at Park Heon-young's home to plan the organization of a reactionary political party and a "new government" under Park Heon-young as "prime minister," affiliated with the United States, and guaranteeing the interests of capitalists and landlords, in an attempt to come to power after subverting the Party and government through armed rebellion.

　　After the indictment was read out, Park Heon-young fully admitted all the crimes stated in the indictment in court.

　　Then, the witness was questioned. The witness's testimony once again proved Park Heon-young's crimes.

　　Then, Li Songyun, the Chief Procurator of the Supreme Procuratorate, spoke on Park Heon-young's crimes. He said that this trial would deal a huge blow to American imperialism's aggressive plot against our motherland and people.

　　The Special Tribunal announced that it confirmed Park Heon-young's espionage activities in serving American imperialism by betraying the motherland, with the aim of opposing the autonomous independence of Korea and subverting the Republic, as well as counter-revolutionary sabotage and propaganda and incitement activities, and protecting and guaranteeing Lee Seung-yeop and others to realize the conspiracy of armed rebellion. According to the laws of the Republic and Park Heon-young's crimes, the Special Tribunal sentenced Park Heon-young to death and confiscated all his property.

    朝鲜最高裁判所特别法庭
    依法判处美国间谍、叛国犯朴宪永以死刑
    新华社平壤十八日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高裁判所特别法庭在十二月十五日公审了长期充当美帝国主义间谍、企图颠覆共和国的叛徒朴宪永，并且依法判处朴宪永以死刑。
    根据朝鲜最高人民会议的决定，特别法庭的裁判长由共和国次帅崔庸健担任，担任参审员的有国家检阅相金翊善、劳动党中央委员会检阅委员会委员长林海、内务相方学世、最高裁判所所长赵诚模。出庭作证的有权五稷等三人。法庭内拥满了前来旁听的人。
    特别法庭开庭后，首先宣读了起诉书。起诉书根据确凿的事实说明，朴宪永是在一九五三年被公审处决了的李承烨、李康国叛国匪帮的头子，并且证明美帝国主义是这个事件的直接组织者。
    起诉书指出，朴宪永在一九一九年在汉城就结识了美国老牌特务安德伍德。一九二五年十一月，朴宪永被日本警察逮捕，就向日本帝国主义者自首，并且暴露了朝鲜共产党和共产主义青年团的秘密组织，使组织的领导干部被捕。从这时开始，他就成为朝鲜人民的敌人。
    一九三九年十月，朴宪永又同美国特务安德伍德会面，并且充当了美国间谍。同年十二月，朴宪永奉安德伍德的指令，叫他钻入朝鲜革命队伍内部，篡夺领导地位，同时搜集和提供秘密情报。
    “八·一五”朝鲜解放以后，朴宪永把自己装扮成“爱国者”，拉拢了一些背叛和脱离革命的宗派分子，并且在南朝鲜篡夺了共产党书记的职位。
    一九四五年九月底，他在汉城半岛旅馆和当时驻南朝鲜美军司令霍奇进行秘密会谈，约定使共产党服从美军军政厅。
    一九四五年十一月，他又一次和霍奇、安德伍德进行秘密会谈，接到霍奇指令。从此朴宪永根据这一指令，制造了各种旨在削弱和麻痹党的战斗力量以及扼杀南朝鲜的爱国的民主力量的罪行。一九四六年二月他又同霍奇秘密会见，其后又会见了两次，他向霍奇提供了有关共产党中央到地方的全部组织系统和它的活动情况、历史情况、在党领导下的群众团体的组织系统、干部名单和民主主义统一战线政策、党对苏美联合委员会的态度等材料。
    一九四六年三月，朴宪永根据霍奇的指令，把叛国匪徒李承烨、赵一明等安置在党的重要位置上，并且指导和保障他们的间谍活动。在一九四六年三月到一九四七年九月，朴宪永指使李承烨和赵一明前后六次向美军提供党内的重要机密。同年十月初，朴宪永奉到霍奇的指令进入北朝鲜。
    朴宪永在进入北朝鲜后，先后使霍奇直接派遣的李承烨、李康国和美军远东司令部航空情报官尼科尔斯所派遣的间谍分子安永达、白亨福等潜伏在党和国家机关的内部，窃据重要职务。一九四九年春，朴宪永奉霍奇的指令还使美国特务亨·艾利斯、李沙民进入共和国并且担任要职。在这时期内，朴宪永又通过李承烨把有关北朝鲜劳动党的重要决定、党内的机密材料转给霍奇。在朴宪永的庇护下，李康国前后五次向美军特务机关提供了有关人民军和警备队的实力和兵力配备的情况和北朝鲜人民委员会机构、国家预算等机密文件。
    霍奇回国后，朴宪永受到霍奇的指令继续在美国驻汉城大使馆政治顾问诺布尔的指示下进行活动，朴宪永同李承烨还一同会见过诺布尔。
    美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以后，朴宪永疯狂地制造削弱共和国的威力、企图使共和国失败的罪行。一九五零年人民军解放汉城后，李承烨和朴宪永共谋组织了秘密杀人团体，对发觉他们的叛国罪行的人加上“变节”、“间谍嫌疑”的罪名，加以杀害。
    一九五一年九月，朴宪永同李承烨、裴哲等一起秘密集会，讨论了策应预计的敌人的军事攻势、进行颠覆党和政府的武装暴动计划，并且组成了武装暴动指挥部。他们企图以开城为中心的京畿道作为反革命的根据地。一九五二年九月，这些叛国匪徒在朴宪永家中秘密集会，策划组织反动政党和以朴宪永为“首相”的隶属于美国、保障资本家和地主利益的“新政府”，企图在以武装暴动颠覆党和政府后上台。
    起诉书宣读完毕后，朴宪永在法庭上全部承认了起诉书中说明的一切罪行。
    接着又讯问了证人。证人的供述再一次证明了朴宪永的罪行。
    然后，最高检察所检察总长李松云对朴宪永的罪行发言。他说，这次审判将给予美帝国主义对我们祖国和人民的侵略阴谋以巨大的打击。
    特别法庭宣布确认朴宪永以反对朝鲜的自主独立、颠覆共和国为目的，背叛祖国，服务于美帝国主义的间谍行为，以及反革命破坏和宣传煽动行为，庇护和保障李承烨等实现武装暴动的阴谋。特别法庭根据共和国的法律和朴宪永的罪行，判处朴宪永以死刑，并且没收他的全部财产。
