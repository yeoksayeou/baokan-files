    People's Postal and Telecommunications Network on the Tibetan Plateau
    Si Xue
    The people's postal and telecommunications services in the Tibet region are being gradually established and developed on a new foundation.
    From 1951 to 1955, nineteen postal and telecommunications bureaus were successively established on the vast Tibetan Plateau of the motherland, including Qamdo, Lhasa, Xigaze, and Gyantse, along with nine postal business offices such as Phari and Zogang, and seven postal agency offices such as Tuoba and Basu, as well as the Gadake Telecommunications Bureau and the Shudug Post Office. The total length of postal routes is 4,598 kilometers. In December 1953, the Tibet Postal and Telecommunications Administration was officially established. With the development of postal and telecommunications services in the Tibet region, the opening of radio telephone services between Lhasa and Beijing, Chongqing, Chengdu, Qamdo, and other places has further strengthened the connection between Tibet and the mainland of the motherland, as well as between major towns in Tibet.
    Before the highway reached Lhasa, people entering Tibet had to wait for several months to receive letters from the interior. Many people wanted to subscribe to newspapers and periodicals, but were restricted due to transportation difficulties. However, as the highway extended, postal vehicles followed. Starting from January of this year, there were regular postal vehicles running between Qamdo and Lhasa. The Tibet Postal and Telecommunications Administration began offering subscriptions and sales of newspapers and periodicals, as well as parcel delivery services, greatly shortening delivery times compared to the past. In the past, newspapers and periodicals published in Beijing had to go through forty-eight horse stations after being transported by car to Qamdo, taking about two months to reach Lhasa. Now, newspapers and periodicals published in Beijing can reach readers in Lhasa in just over twenty days. Before the end of 1954, there were only seven types of newspapers and periodicals distributed through postal and telecommunications bureaus in the Tibet region. Now, the Lhasa Postal and Telecommunications Bureau alone subscribes to and sells more than two hundred types. The number of newspapers subscribed to and sold in the first quarter of this year increased more than twenty times compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The Lhasa Postal and Telecommunications Bureau received and dispatched 450 percent more letters in the first quarter of this year than in the fourth quarter of last year. Remittances from postal and telecommunications institutions in various parts of Tibet to the interior also increased by 170 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
    Many exemplary figures have emerged in the arduous work. Postal worker Bai Jianchu is one of them. Once last year, during the rainy season, three hours before the Nyang Chu River flooded, he set off from Xigaze to Gyantse to deliver letters. When he reached a valley about thirty miles from Xigaze, a flash flood suddenly struck, with the water reaching more than four feet deep. Inspired by his sense of honor in people's postal service work, Bai Jianchu held the mail on his head and fought the flood for ten hours, braving the biting cold wind, until late at night when he climbed a small mountain and continued to Gyantse, finally completing the postal delivery task victoriously.
    The development of postal and telecommunications services in the Tibet region and the efforts of all postal and telecommunications workers have been deeply welcomed by the people of Tibet.

    西藏高原上的人民邮电网
    思雪
    西藏地区的人民邮电事业，正在一个新的基础上逐步建立和发展起来。
    从一九五一年到一九五五年间，在祖国辽阔的西藏高原上，先后成立了昌都、拉萨、日喀则、江孜等十九个邮电局，帕里、左贡等九个邮政营业处和妥坝、八宿等七个邮政代办所，以及噶大克电信局和硕督邮局。邮路共长四千五百九十八公里。一九五三年十二月，正式成立了西藏邮电管理局。由于西藏地区邮电业务的开展；拉萨和北京、重庆、成都、昌都等地的无线电话的开放，进一步加强了西藏和祖国内地以及西藏各主要城镇之间的联系。
    在公路没有修到拉萨以前，进藏人员要盼上好几个月，才能接到远从内地的来信。许多人想订阅报刊，也因为运输困难而受到限制。但是由于公路修到那里，邮车就开到了那里，从今年一月起，昌都和拉萨间就有了定期对开的邮车，西藏邮电管理局开办了订销报刊和投递包裹的业务，传递时间比过去大大缩短了。过去北京出版的报刊，由汽车运到昌都后，还要经过四十八个马站，大约两个月才能寄到拉萨，现在北京出版的报刊，只要二十多天就可以和拉萨的读者见面了。在一九五四年年底以前，西藏地区经邮电局发行的报刊一共才有七种，现在只拉萨邮电局订销的报刊就有二百多种了。今年第一季度订销的报纸，比去年第四季度增加了二十倍以上。拉萨邮电局在今年第一季度接收和封发的信件，比去年第四季度增加了百分之四百五十。由西藏各地邮电机构汇往内地的款项，今年第一季度也比去年第四季度增加了百分之一百七十。
    在艰苦的工作中曾经出现了许多模范人物。邮运员白建楚就是其中的一个。去年有一次，正当雨季期间，在年楚河洪水暴发以前的三小时，他从日喀则出发到江孜去送信，到了距日喀则约三十里的山谷中，洪水突然汹涌袭来，水深达四尺多，白建楚在人民邮运工作的荣誉感的鼓舞下，就把邮件顶在头上，不顾刺骨的寒风，跟洪水搏斗了十个小时，直到深夜才爬上一座小山，继续向江孜前进，终于胜利地完成了邮运任务。
    西藏地区邮电事业的开展和全体邮电工作人员的努力，深深受到了西藏人民的欢迎。
