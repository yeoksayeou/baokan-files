With a Bumper Harvest and Increased Production, Even More Attention Should Be Paid to Running Cooperatives Diligently and Frugally
Zhang Pingdong, Fu Xuezhou
    In Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, about 80% of agricultural production cooperatives have increased production by 10% to 20% this year. However, during the autumn harvest distribution, some cooperatives experienced a phenomenon of "production not increasing much, but expenses increasing, withholdings increasing, and dividends decreasing." According to an understanding of 1,544 cooperatives in three counties—Pingshan (mountainous area), Jin County (cotton area), and Hengshui (semi-grain area)—there were 597 cooperatives where withholdings and expenses accounted for 30% to 40% of the total income, accounting for 38.6% of the total number of cooperatives. There were 58 cooperatives where withholdings and expenses accounted for 40% to 50% of the total income, accounting for 3.7% of the total number of cooperatives. Some cooperative cadres believe that "they have been constrained in running the cooperative in the past, and now that production has increased this year, they should relax a bit," and they are generous with expenses, resulting in excessive withholdings. This year, the expenses of the "Sheng Shen" Agricultural Cooperative in Gaoquan Village, Hengshui County, have already accounted for 43.2% of the total income, and another 23.5% of the total income has been withheld as production costs for the coming year. As a result, only 33.3% is actually distributed to the members. Some cooperatives' apportionment of share funds is too high, which is also one of the reasons for the low dividends.

    The main reason for the above problems is that the party committees at all levels do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of doing a good job in distribution. They believe that since there has been a bumper harvest this year and they have several years of experience in distribution work, there will be no major problems. Therefore, they have relaxed the inspection and leadership of the distribution work of agricultural cooperatives, and problems cannot be discovered and resolved in a timely manner. Secondly, the demarcation of various expenses is not clear: expenses that should be paid from the public accumulation fund are paid from the total income; expenses that do not need to be fully paid this year are fully paid; and income that should be calculated is not calculated. Thirdly, due to the lack of education for cooperative cadres on "running cooperatives diligently and frugally," many people have developed ideas of extravagance and waste in the context of increasing production year by year. Fourthly, in some cooperatives, the cooperative cadres monopolize the distribution, without consulting with the members. They believe that "as long as production increases, it will be easy to say," simplifying the distribution work.

    In response to the above problems, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the CPC has taken the following measures: The party committees at all levels, through holding accounting meetings, further clarify the importance of doing a good job in the autumn harvest distribution and explain the specific policies related to the distribution work; criticize the attitude of simply engaging in distribution work and being indifferent, as well as the ideas of extravagance and waste; conduct ideological education on "running cooperatives diligently and frugally" using vivid examples; and focus on solving the problems of large expenses, excessive withholdings, and low dividends. Specific methods: First, county-level, district-level, or area-based accounting meetings are held, allowing accountants to bring account books, distribution plans, and abacuses to the meeting for focused inspection and revision of distribution plans. Hengshui, Zhengding, Jin County, Shenze and other counties have done this, with great results. Hengshui County basically solved the problems of large expenses, excessive withholdings, and low dividends existing in 175 cooperatives through such meetings. Second, through the accounting station, establish accounting mutual aid groups to revise distribution plans based on existing problems. Third, send special personnel to the three types of cooperatives with major problems to provide specific assistance. For example, Jingxing County extracted 19 accountants from enterprises and sent them to 58 cooperatives with major distribution problems to provide specific assistance. In addition, the leading organs impose necessary controls on the scope and quantity of expenses of cooperatives, proposing that, in general crop areas, expenses should not exceed 25% of the total income, and in economic crop areas, the maximum should not exceed 30%. The Hengshui County Party Committee also stipulates that all cooperative distribution plans must be reviewed and approved by the District Party Committee before they can be implemented. After taking the above measures, the problems existing in the current distribution work of cooperatives have been gradually resolved.

    丰收增产，更要注意勤俭办社
    张屏东　傅学周
    河北省石家庄专区今年有百分之八十左右的农业生产合作社增产一成到二成，但在秋收分配中，部分合作社出现了增产不多分——开支大、扣留多、分红少的现象。据平山（山区）、晋县（棉区）、衡水（半粮区）三县一千五百四十四个社的了解，其中扣留开支占总收入百分之三十到四十的有五百九十七个社，占总社数的百分之三十八点六；扣留开支占总收入的百分之四十到五十的有五十八个社，占总社数的百分之三点七。有些社干部认为“前段办社受了憋，今年增了产要松松心”，对开支是宽打宽用，造成扣留过多。衡水县高圈村“生甡”农业合作社今年的开支已占总收入的百分之四十三点二，又从总收入中扣留了百分之二十三点五作为来年生产费用。这样，实际分配到社员手中的仅剩下百分之三十三点三了。有些社摊派股份基金偏高，也是促成分红少的原因之一。
    产生上述问题的主要原因，首先是各级党委对作好分配工作的重要意义认识不足。他们认为：今年丰收了，又有了几年分配工作的经验，出不了什么大问题，因而放松了对农业合作社分配工作的检查和领导，问题不能及时发现和解决。其次是对各项开支的界线划分不明确：应从公积金开支的，从总收入开支了；不需要今年全部开支的，全部开支了；应计算收入的没有计算收入。第三是，由于对社干部缺乏“勤俭办社”的教育，在逐年增产的情况下，许多人滋长了铺张浪费的思想。第四是，一些社在分配中，社干部包办，不同社员商量，他们认为“只要增了产就好说”，把分配工作简单化。
    针对上述问题，中共石家庄地委会采取了如下的措施：由各级党委通过召开会计会议，进一步讲清作好秋收分配工作的重要意义和交代有关分配工作的具体政策；批判对分配工作简单从事、漠不关心的态度，以及铺张浪费思想；用活的事例进行“勤俭办社”的思想教育；集中解决开支大、扣留多、分红少的问题。具体办法：一是以县以区或分片召开会计会议，让会计带账本、分配方案和算盘到会，有重点地进行检查，修订分配方案。衡水、正定、晋县、深泽等县这样作，收效很大。衡水一县通过这样的会议，基本上解决了一百七十五个社存在的开支大、扣留多、分红少的问题。二是通过会计站，建立会计互助小组，根据现存问题，修订分配方案。三是派专人到问题大的三类社进行具体帮助。例如井陉县在企业单位内，抽出十九名会计分赴五十八个分配问题大的社进行具体帮助。另外，由领导机关对合作社的开支范围和数量加以必要的控制，提出一般作物地区的社，开支不能超过总收入的百分之二十五，经济作物区最高不得超过百分之三十。衡水县委还规定：各社分配方案一律须经区委审查批准才可执行。经过采取以上措施，目前合作社分配工作中存在的问题已逐步得到解决。
