Zhejiang Province's health administration departments have trained more than 5,450 health workers for over 5,000 agricultural production cooperatives (including fishery and salt production cooperatives and state-owned farms) in 66 counties and cities, including Jinhua, Shouchang, Yuyao, Shangyu, and Daishan. After short-term training, these health workers have played a significant role in conducting health education, mobilizing the masses to improve the sanitary environment inside and outside the cooperatives, and providing first aid for general injuries. The Qinyong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yangdu Township, Linhai County, with 244 households, saw its members lose over 2,270 workdays due to illness last year, with medical expenses amounting to more than 360 yuan. This year, under the leadership of the health worker, all members were mobilized to fill in the smelly stagnant pools in the village that had been accumulating water for more than 30 years; the sewage ditches that had been blocked for more than 60 years were cleared; and a regular sanitation cleaning system was established. In previous years, many members of this cooperative contracted malaria in June, but this year only three people were affected; common injuries are also quickly healed after first aid and simple treatment by the health worker. Many agricultural production cooperatives in Jinhua, Jiangshan, Lanxi, and other counties have included "general cleaning and accumulation of soil fertilizer" in their production plans as a regular production task.
    To adapt to the new situation after the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Health has decided to train another 6,000 health workers for various agricultural production cooperatives this winter. It is expected that by 1957, there will be 30,000 health workers in agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province who will not be separated from production, meaning that each township in the province will have an average of four to five health workers.

    浙江训练农业合作社保健员
    浙江省卫生行政部门已经为金华、寿昌、余姚、上虞、岱山等六十六个县市的五千多个农业生产合作社（包括渔、盐业生产合作社和国营农场）训练了五千四百五十多名保健员。这些保健员经过短期的学习，回社后在开展卫生宣传、发动群众改善社内外环境卫生及一般外伤急救等工作上起了很大的作用。临海县洋渡乡勤勇农业生产合作社有二百四十四户，去年社员因病缺勤误了二千二百七十多工，用去医药费三百六十多元。今年在保健员的带动下，发动全体社员填平了村里三十多年来积水不干的臭水塘；疏通了阻塞六十多年的污水沟；还订了经常性的卫生清扫制度。这个社的社员在往年六月得疟疾的人很多，在今年六月只有三人犯病；一般的外伤经过保健员的急救、简易治疗后也很快就痊愈。金华、江山、兰溪等县的许多农业生产合作社，都已把“大扫除、积土肥”列入生产计划，作为经常性的生产任务。
    浙江省卫生厅为适应农业合作化高潮到来后的新形势，决定在今冬再为各农业生产合作社训练保健员六千名，预计到一九五七年全省农业生产合作社将有三万名不脱离生产的保健员，即全省每一个乡平均有保健员四至五人。（本报驻杭州记者）
