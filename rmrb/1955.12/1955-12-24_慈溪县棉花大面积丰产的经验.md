Experiences in Large-Scale High Yield of Cotton in Cixi County
Zang Chengyao, Director of the Cotton Production Division of the General Bureau of Economic Crop Production, Ministry of Agriculture

In recent years, Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, has rapidly increased its cotton yield per unit area. In 1950, the county produced 38.99 jin of cotton per mu (lint, same below); in 1953, 44.16 jin per mu; in 1954, 53.26 jin per mu; and this year, the average yield on more than 520,000 mu of cotton fields reached 79 jin per mu (Note: As of November 20th, the amount of cotton purchased in Cixi County had already reached an average of 66 jin per mu, and the estimated purchase amount could reach over 75 jin per mu). The cotton yield per unit area in the county has increased by 102.8 percent in five years, an average annual increase of 20.5 percent. This year, Shengbei, Xinpu, Shuiyin, Fuhai, and other four townships planted a total of 19,447.16 mu of cotton, with an average yield of 100 jin per mu. The 268.83 mu of cotton fields in the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative of Dongshan Township produced an average of 124.26 jin per mu, with 1.458 mu of high-yield fields producing 189.24 jin per mu.

Such a large-scale cotton high-yield record as in Cixi County is not only the first among cotton-producing counties in the southern double-cropping cotton region, but also outstanding compared with the northern single-cropping cotton region. If the unit area yield of more than 30 million mu of cotton fields in the southern double-cropping cotton region could be increased to the level of Cixi County, then the annual cotton production in the southern double-cropping cotton region alone would exceed the total national cotton production in 1954. Cixi County not only has high cotton yields, but also high yields of pre-season crops.

In 1955, the average yield of broad beans in the county was 94.4 jin per mu, the average yield of barley was 171 jin per mu, and the yield of wheat was 119.2 jin per mu. The experience of Cixi County in increasing production is extremely valuable, and its high-yield technical measures are relatively easy to implement. In order to promote the experience of Cixi County, in mid-November 1955, the Ministry of Agriculture organized more than 50 people, including agricultural workers and agricultural cooperative chairmen from seven southern provinces, as well as scientific workers and professors from two scientific research institutes and one agricultural college, to visit Cixi. Many visitors have increased their confidence in increasing cotton production and expressed their intention to promote the large-scale high-yield experience of Cixi County in their own regions.

What are the reasons for Cixi County's high cotton yield? What advanced experience does it have in cultivation and planting techniques?

First, attach importance to fertilization. The county plants green manure (the local green manure is alfalfa, which farmers call grass seeds) in more than 80 percent of the cotton fields to improve soil fertility. The farmland in this area is double-cropped with grain and cotton in a year, and the soil fertility is greatly depleted. Fully utilizing the superior conditions of the warm climate in the south to plant green manure can supply nutrients for grain crops and cotton, and increase the organic matter in the soil. Farmers say: "A thin layer of grass seeds is equivalent to a load of bean cake (meaning that a thin layer of green manure is equivalent to applying one hundred jin of bean cake)." The comparative test results of the First Agricultural Cooperative of Dongshan Township show that cotton fields planted with green manure yielded 15 jin more per mu than those without green manure.

The method of planting green manure is: sow the green manure in rows between the cotton rows in late October, with a row spacing of three to four chi. In early November, after pulling out the cotton stalks, plant winter crops between the green manure rows; in early and mid-April of the following year, cut down the green manure during its flowering period and turn it into the ground at a depth of four to six cun; sow cotton on top in late April. No matter what the winter crop is, green manure should be intercropped. This cultivation method has three benefits: 1. The cotton fields have green manure as base fertilizer; 2. Grain and cotton can be sown in a timely manner; 3. The land is partially tilled separately before planting cotton and winter crops.

In order to increase soil fertility, cotton farmers also pay great attention to digging river mud and accumulating soil fertilizer. This year, an average of more than 100 dan of river mud were applied per mu. The cotton farmers in this county have the habit of accumulating human and animal manure. Each household has one or two manure tanks, and agricultural cooperatives have manure pools for accumulating human and animal manure. Each person can accumulate eight to ten dan of human and animal manure per year. More than ten dan of diluted human and animal manure are applied to each mu of wheat field on average, and another four or five dan are applied to cotton seedlings in mid-May to late May in order to promote seedling growth, strengthen seedlings, and reduce the adverse effects of cotton seedlings being suppressed between wheat rows.

In addition, more commercial fertilizers were also applied. This year, from January to September, the county actually sold more than 6 million jin of ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate. Except for 6 percent applied in rice areas, the average application rate per mu of cotton field was about 11 jin, an increase of 69 percent over 1954. The actual sales of superphosphate were more than 4 million jin, with an average application of about 8 jin per mu of cotton field, an increase of more than 13 times over 1954. The actual sales of cake fertilizer were more than 11 million jin, with an average application of 20 jin per mu of cotton field, an increase of 4.1 times over last year. The method of fertilization is as follows: Ammonium sulfate is top-dressed during the seedling stage, budding stage, and full flowering stage depending on the growth of the seedlings. Part of the phosphate fertilizer is applied as top-dressing for green manure in mid-to-late November (10 jin per mu). Most of the phosphate fertilizer is mixed with decomposed cake fertilizer and applied as top-dressing during the cotton budding stage. In early August of this year, the county learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and carried out foliar spraying of phosphate fertilizer on more than 60,000 mu of cotton fields; according to typical comparative tests, each mu could increase production by 4.1 to 18 percent as a result. The relatively widespread application of chemical fertilizers, especially phosphate fertilizer, on such a large area of cotton fields is one of the important factors for the high yield of cotton fields in Cixi County.

Second, implement close planting. Many people have concerns about implementing close planting of cotton in the southern double-cropping cotton region, mainly because they are afraid of excessive growth and boll rot. However, cotton farmers in Cixi County believe that high yield requires close planting and increasing the amount of sowing. There is a local saying: "Only with a thousand plants can you have a thousand peaches; one plant cannot produce a thousand flowers." The eastern part of Cixi originally had the habit of broadcasting and close planting, but in recent years, in order to facilitate fine processing and management, row planting has been implemented. This year, the row spacing of cotton fields is 1.3 to 1.7 chi, with 5,500 to 8,000 plants per mu, generally with five to seven bolls per plant, and a sowing rate of more than 12 jin. According to the experiment of the Second Farm of Cixi County, a cotton field with 4,800 plants per mu produced 135.28 jin of lint; one with 5,577 plants produced 140.22 jin; and one with 6,597 plants produced 155 jin. It can be seen that the potential for increasing production through close planting is still very large.

Third, resist drought and prevent waterlogging. There is a lot of rain in May and June and September and October, and drought in July and August, which greatly threatens cotton production. However, due to the adoption of drainage and waterlogging prevention measures such as building sea dikes and deep ditches and high ridges in the fields, natural disasters have been greatly reduced. The county party committee and government lead farmers to vigorously build large and small-scale water conservancy projects every year. Drainage channels have been opened and dredged in cotton areas, which not only ensures good drainage of cotton fields, but also increases water storage capacity. In the past, some cotton fields would be flooded after continuous rainfall of 50 mm, but now they will not be flooded even after continuous rainfall of 80 mm. In order to facilitate drainage, last year cotton farmers mostly changed the field ridges from more than four chi to three to 3.6 chi, with ridge ditches five to eight cun deep and seven to eight cun wide. Every year, in conjunction with mid-tillage and fertilization, ditches are cleared and soil is cultivated six to eight times after rain. In addition, the number of mid-tillage operations is also very high. Winter crops are mid-tilled three to four times, and cotton is mid-tilled four to five times, which not only plays a role in resisting drought and preventing waterlogging, but also reduces weeds in the fields. In recent years, the area of irrigated cotton fields in the county has been expanded to more than 20,000 mu.

Fourth, adopt improved cotton varieties. In recent years, the county has replaced coarse cotton and degraded Dezi cotton with improved Daizi cotton. In 1949, coarse cotton accounted for 60 percent of the county's total, and degraded Dezi cotton accounted for 40 percent. In 1951, cotton farmers spontaneously introduced Daizi cotton from Pinghu, Zhejiang, and other places for trial planting. The results of comparative tests in the same year showed that the yield of Daizi cotton per mu was 10 jin more than that of Dezi cotton, and the ginning percentage was 5 percent higher than that of Dezi cotton; the yield of Daizi cotton per mu was 14 jin higher than that of coarse cotton, and the ginning percentage was the same as that of coarse cotton. Due to the significant increase in production, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture introduced 1.39 million jin of Daizi cotton seeds from Jiangsu in the three years from 1953 to 1955; various counties also organized the masses to propagate a part of Daizi cotton locally. Therefore, the planting area of Daizi cotton has increased to 440,000 mu this year, accounting for more than 84 percent of the county's cotton field area. This year, the average yield of Daizi cotton in the county was 80 jin per mu, and the yield of coarse cotton was 64 jin per mu, the former being 25 percent higher than the latter.

Fifth, prevent insect pests. Cixi County, like other cotton areas in the south, is plagued by cutworms, aphids, red spiders, bollworms, leaf rollers, leafhoppers, etc. However, due to the large supply of pesticides and equipment from the state, the county has basically replaced manual capture with pesticide and equipment prevention and control this year. Because thorough pest control has been achieved, pest damage has been reduced to the lowest limit (the prevention and control of bollworms is not well done), therefore, the statement that there are many insect pests in the southern cotton area and it is difficult to increase production has been completely broken. This year, the county has 13,968 sprayers, an average of one sprayer for every 40 mu. From January to October, the county supplied 860,000 jin of pesticides such as 666, rotenone, and lime-sulfur mixture, which is 2.3 times the total amount of pesticides used in Yuyao, Cixi, and Zhenhai counties in the five years from 1950 to 1954. The average application rate per mu of cotton field in the county is 1.7 jin.

Although the cotton yield in Cixi County is already very high, the potential for increasing production is still very large. For example, the average yield of cotton fields per mu in the county is 79 jin, while the highest yield is 189.24 jin. Bollworm damage is still very serious. If thorough prevention and control methods such as field prevention and control, sunning and capturing, warehouse coating, and fumigation of cottonseed are adopted, cotton production can be greatly increased. There are still 80,000 mu of coarse cotton in the county that have not been replanted with Daizi cotton. In terms of seed selection, only grain selection has been done; field plant selection has not been widely promoted. The number of seedlings per mu in many cotton fields is still lower than the county's standard of 5,000 to 7,000 plants. In terms of pruning, only topping and removing leaf branches have been done, and the implementation of side topping is not common. Although it has been proven that April 20th is the appropriate sowing date, there are still delays until mid-to-late May, and seedling setting is also delayed until mid-June, resulting in crowded seedlings and poor cotton plant development. If the above-mentioned planting techniques can be conscientiously improved, and the advanced experience of raising seedlings and transplanting can be promoted, cotton production can continue to increase.

With the advent of the upsurge of cooperativization, the issue of gradually changing the current intercropping method in the double-cropping cotton area to facilitate the application of new agricultural tools and mechanized cultivation has been put on the agenda. Luo Xianggen, chairman of the Wudongzha Agricultural Cooperative (advanced cooperative), said: "Planting green manure before the cotton is harvested, and planting cotton in the winter crop rows, this cultivation method has its advantages, but new agricultural tools cannot be used. Therefore, we have decided to change the intercropping method and plant barley, broad beans, rapeseed, and green manure separately, all in full ridges. In the spring of the following year, after the green manure is harvested, half of the green manure is plowed and cotton is sown after plowing; the other half is left to be plowed into the winter crop fields after the winter crops are harvested, and cotton is planted by means of raising seedlings and transplanting. After the autumn cotton harvest, the winter crops are plowed in a timely manner. In this way, new agricultural tools and tractors can be used to plow twice a year, and animal-drawn agricultural tools can be used for sowing, mid-tillage, and pest control. In this way, timely sowing and close planting can be achieved, and the mutual influence on yield during intercropping can be avoided, completely overcoming the contradiction of double cropping."

    慈溪县棉花大面积丰产的经验
    农业部经济作物生产总局棉产处处长　臧成耀
    浙江省慈溪县几年来迅速地提高了棉花单位面积产量。一九五○年这个县每亩产棉花三十八点九九斤（皮棉，下同），一九五三年每亩产四十四点一六斤，一九五四年每亩产五十三点二六斤，今年五十二万多亩棉田每亩平均产量达到七十九斤（按：截止十一月二十日慈溪县收购的棉花数量已经达到平均每亩六十六斤，估计收购量可达每亩七十五斤以上）。全县棉花单位面积产量在五年中提高了百分之一百零二点八，平均每年提高百分之二十点五。胜北、新浦、水霪、附海等四乡今年共种一万九千四百四十七点一六亩棉花，平均每亩产一百斤。东山乡红星农业合作社的二百六十八点八三亩棉田，平均每亩产一百二十四点二六斤，其中一点四五八亩丰产田每亩产一百八十九点二四斤。
    像慈溪县这样的大面积棉花丰产纪录，不仅在南方两熟棉区的产棉县中是第一位，就是和北方一熟棉区比较，也是突出的。如果南方两熟棉区三千多万亩棉田的单位面积产量都能提高到慈溪县的水平，那末，只南方两熟棉区每年所产的棉花，就超过了一九五四年全国棉花的总产量。慈溪县不仅棉花产量高，而且棉花的前季作物的产量也不低。
  一九五五年全县每亩蚕豆平均产量是九十四点四斤，每亩大麦产量是一百七十一斤，小麦产量是一百十九点二斤。慈溪县的增产经验是极可贵的，而且它的丰产技术措施是比较容易办到的。为了推广慈溪县的经验，一九五五年十一月中旬，农业部曾经组织南方七省的农业工作人员和农业合作社社长以及两个科学研究所、一个农学院的科学工作者和教授等五十多人到慈溪参观。许多参观的人都提高了增产棉花的信心，表示要在自己的地区推广慈溪县的大面积丰产经验。
    慈溪县获得棉花高额产量的原因是什么呢？它在耕作栽培技术上有什么先进经验呢？
    第一，重视施肥。这个县在百分之八十以上的棉田里种植绿肥（当地的绿肥是黄花苜蓿，农民把它叫做草子），以提高地力。这一带的农田是一年粮、棉两熟，地力消耗很大。充分利用南方气候温暖的优越条件来种植绿肥，可以供给粮食作物和棉花的养分，增加土壤的有机质。农民说：草子薄薄摊，豆饼抵一担（就是说：绿肥长薄薄的一层，等于上了一百斤豆饼）。东山乡第一农业合作社的对比试验结果，种绿肥的棉田比不种绿肥的棉田，每亩增产十五斤。
    种植绿肥的方法是：十月下旬把绿肥条播在棉行中间，行距三尺到四尺。十一月初，拔棉柴后，再把冬季作物种在绿肥行间；第二年四月上、中旬，在绿肥盛花期把它割倒翻在四至六寸深的地下；四月下旬在上面播种棉花。不论冬季作物是什么，都要间作绿肥。这种耕作方法有三个好处：一、棉田有了绿肥作基肥；二、粮、棉都能适时播种；三、种棉和种冬季作物前都对田地分别地局部地进行了耕翻。
    为了增加土壤的肥力，棉农对于挖河泥、积土肥也十分注意。今年平均每亩上河泥一百多担。这个县的棉农都有积存人粪尿的习惯。每户都有一两个粪缸，农业合作社都有积存人粪尿的粪池，每人每年可积蓄人粪尿八至十担。在每亩麦田平均追施稀释的人粪尿十多担，五月中、下旬又在棉苗上施用四、五担，以便提苗、壮苗，减轻棉苗在麦行间受到抑制的不利影响。
    此外，还施用了较多的商品肥料。今年全县一月至九月实销硫酸铵和硝酸铵六百多万斤。除稻区施用了百分之六外，平均每亩棉田用量在十一斤左右，比一九五四年增加了百分之六十九。过磷酸钙实销四百多万斤，平均每亩棉田施用八斤左右，比一九五四年增加十三倍多。饼肥实销一千一百多万斤，平均每亩棉田施用二十斤，比去年增加四点一倍。施肥的方法是这样的：硫酸铵在苗期、蕾期和盛花期看苗追施。一部分磷肥在十一月中、下旬施作绿肥的追肥（每亩施十斤）。大部分磷肥是在棉花蕾期和腐熟的饼肥混合施作追肥。今年八月上旬，全县学习苏联先进经验，在六万多亩棉田中进行了根外喷施磷肥；据典型对比试验，每亩可因此增产百分之四点一到十八。在这样大面积的棉田上，较普遍地施用化学肥料，特别是磷肥，这是慈溪县棉田丰产的重要因素之一。
    第二，实行密植。许多人对于在南方两熟棉区实行棉花密植是有顾虑的，主要是怕疯长、烂铃。但是慈溪县的棉农却认为要丰产，必须实行密植，加大播种量。当地有句俗话：“只有千株千个桃，没有一株千朵花。”慈溪东部原来就有撒播密植的习惯，近年为了精细加工和管理方便，都实行了条播。今年棉田行距一点三至一点七尺，每亩五千五百株至八千株，每株一般有铃五至七个，播种量在十二斤以上。根据慈溪县第二农场试验，每亩四千八百株的棉田产皮棉一百三十五点二八斤；五千五百七十七株的产一百四十点二二斤；六千五百九十七株的产一百五十五斤。可见密植增产的潜力还是很大的。
      第三，抗旱防涝。当地五、六月和九、十月间多雨，七、八月间伏旱，这种气候使棉花增产受到很大威胁。但是由于采用修筑海堤和田间的深沟高畦等排水防涝措施，自然灾害已经大大减轻。县的党委和政府每年都领导农民大力修筑大小型水利工程。在棉区开辟和疏浚了排水渠道，不仅棉田排水良好，而且也增加了蓄水能力。过去有的棉田连续降雨五十公厘就遭水淹，现在连续降雨八十公厘，也不致被淹。为了便于排水，去年棉农多把田畦由四尺以上的改为三至三点六尺，畦沟深五至八寸，沟宽七至八寸。每年结合中耕施肥，在雨后清沟培土六至八次。此外，中耕的次数也很多。冬作中耕三至四次，棉花中耕四至五次，这不仅起了抗旱防涝作用，而且减少了地里的杂草。几年来全县灌溉棉田已经扩大到二万多亩。
    第四，采用优良棉种。这个县几年来用优良的岱字棉更换了粗绒棉和退化德字棉。一九四九年全县粗绒棉占百分之六十，退化德字棉占百分之四十。一九五一年棉农曾自动地从浙江平湖等地引入岱字棉试种，当年对比试验的结果，岱字棉的每亩产量比德字棉多十斤，衣分率比德字棉高百分之五；岱字棉的每亩产量比粗绒棉高十四斤，衣分率和粗绒棉的相等。由于增产效果显著，浙江省农业厅一九五三年至一九五五年的三年中由江苏引种岱字棉种一百三十九万斤；各县还组织群众就地繁殖了一部分岱字棉。因此岱字棉的种植面积今年已经增加到四十四万亩，占全县棉田面积的百分之八十四以上。今年全县岱字棉平均每亩产八十斤，粗绒棉每亩产六十四斤，前者比后者产量高百分之二十五。
    第五，防止虫害。慈溪县也和南方其他棉区一样，有地老虎、蚜虫、红蜘蛛、红铃虫、卷叶虫、叶跳虫等为害。但是由于国家大量供应药械，今年全县基本上用药械防除代替了人工捕捉。由于作到了彻底治虫，虫害已经减轻到最低限度（防治红铃虫作的还不好），因此，认为南方棉区虫害多，产量很难提高的说法，完全被打破了。今年全县已有一万三千九百六十八架喷雾器，平均每四十亩有一架。一月至十月全县供应二二三、鱼藤精、石灰硫黄合剂等治虫药剂八十六万斤，超过一九五○年至一九五四年五年内余姚、慈溪、镇海三县用药总量的二点三倍，全县棉田平均每亩用药一点七斤。
    慈溪县的棉花产量虽然已经很高，但是增产潜力仍然很大。例如全县每亩棉田的平均产量是七十九斤，而最高产量有一百八十九点二四斤的。红铃虫为害仍然很重，如果采用田间防治、晒花捕捉，仓库涂药、熏蒸棉籽等方法进行彻底防治，棉花还能大大增产。全县还有八万亩粗绒棉没有换种成岱字棉。选种方面，也只做到粒选；田间株选还没有普遍推行。很多棉田每亩留苗株数还低于县规定的五千至七千株的标准。在整枝工作方面，只做到摘心去叶枝，实行打边心的还不多。虽然已经证明四月二十日是播种适期，但是仍有延迟到五月中下旬才下种的，定苗也有迟至六月中旬的，致使棉苗拥挤，棉株发育不良。如果能认真改进以上各方面的种植技术，并且推广育苗移栽的先进经验，棉花产量还能继续提高。
    随着合作化高潮的到来，在两熟棉区逐步改变目前套种方式，以利于应用新式农具和机械化耕作的问题，已经提到议程上来。五洞闸农业合作社（高级社）社长罗祥根说：在棉花没有收完以前就种上绿肥，冬季作物行内又种上棉花，这种耕作方法虽然有它的好处，但是不能使用新式农具。因此，我们决定改变套种方法，把大麦、蚕豆、油菜和绿肥分开种，一律满畦。到第二年春天在绿肥收割后，把一半绿肥翻耕，耕后播种棉花；留一半等冬季作物收割后翻在冬季作物田中，再用育苗移栽的方法种植棉花。秋季棉花收获后，及时翻耕冬作。这样，就可以应用新式农具和拖拉机一年翻耕两次，同时在播种、中耕、治虫等方面应用马拉农具。这样，既能做到适时播种和密植，又能避免套作时互相影响产量，完全克服两熟矛盾。
