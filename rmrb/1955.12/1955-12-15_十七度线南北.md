    North and South of the Seventeenth Parallel
    By Zhan Chao, Special Correspondent for the People's Daily in Vietnam
    Near the seventeenth parallel of north latitude on the map of Vietnam, there quietly lies a not-so-large river flowing from the mountains and forests on the border between Vietnam and Laos – the Ben Hai River. The provisional military demarcation line of Vietnam stipulated by the Geneva Accords mainly follows this river. The areas on both banks of the river, about three to five kilometers each, are designated as demilitarized zones. According to the regulations, in the demilitarized zones on both the South and North sides, only one hundred civil police and public security personnel from the relevant parties are allowed to be stationed to be responsible for local social order and security matters, and all military actions are absolutely prohibited.
    After completing the formalities with the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Commission, I entered the military zone for a visit. Standing on the banks of the Ben Hai River, one can see such a strong contrast! On the same piece of land, under the same sun, the north and south banks of the Ben Hai River are two completely different worlds. Looking north, one can see scenes of peaceful living and restoration of construction everywhere. In the fields, people are cultivating, and water buffaloes are grazing on the edges of the harvested fields, occasionally letting out long moos. At night, the villages are lit up with lights, and singing can be heard everywhere. Here, people can often see movies and performances by amateur cultural troupes, and sometimes even see excellent programs by artists from the capital, Hanoi.
    Looking at the south bank of the Ben Hai River, it is a deathly silence. Several gloomy tin houses, one of which has a higher bunker-like roof, fly the flag of Ngo Dinh Diem, with a yellow background and three black bars. Several foreign soldiers are bathing naked by the river or washing something. It is almost impossible to see anyone walking in the fields. At night, apart from a little light shining from the tin house at the head of the bridge, the south bank of the Ben Hai River is pitch black, and occasionally there are a few piercing gunshots. People living in the southern demilitarized zone are constantly worried about their fate. According to statistics: From August 3rd to October 24th, Ngo Dinh Diem's armed forces invaded the demilitarized zone a total of seventy-three times, with each time ranging from two or three people to as many as one hundred and eighty people. During these two months, they killed one resident, injured one hundred and thirteen residents (five of whom were shot), and arrested one hundred and ninety-nine people in the southern demilitarized zone, and also robbed the residents of large amounts of money, cloth, pigs, chickens, ducks, and other property. Since October, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has, under the pretext of so-called "seeking public opinion," organized armed "order teams" in the southern demilitarized zone; and under the name of "epidemic prevention inspection," sent people to search houses and capture people who support unified negotiations.
    In the northern demilitarized zone, we freely visited several places. This area used to be quite barren, known as "dogs eating stones and chickens eating salt." However, after the restoration of peace, with the care and help of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the people have achieved three consecutive bumper harvests. Mu Village, which used to lack four months of food every year, now has enough to eat this year. In this short period of more than a year, the government of the Republic led the people in the northern demilitarized zone to build dykes totaling more than seven kilometers in length, saving more than 2,000 *mu* (Vietnamese *mu*, each *mu* is approximately equivalent to seven Chinese *mu*. Same below) of land from being submerged by seawater, and has also generally developed small-scale water conservancy projects, excavating two hundred and fifteen ditches, ensuring water use for more than 5,300 *mu* of rice fields. Not long before our arrival, the Bien Tram canal, which can irrigate 700 *mu* of rice fields, had just been completed, and more than 2,000 people in the demilitarized zone held a lively celebration. Fishermen in the Song Gian area, a seaport located in the demilitarized zone, have repaired their fishing boats and resumed production with the help of loans from the Democratic Republic, and the lives of the fishermen have improved. During breaks, the fishermen gather on the beach in Song Gian, setting up nets to play volleyball. The Song Gian market, which had many houses burned down by Ngo Dinh Diem's agents not long ago, is now even more lively. The Song Gian Elementary School here is building a new school building, which was not completed when we arrived.
    People talked about many moving stories. When a typhoon hit this autumn, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent telegrams to the party and government leading organs in the demilitarized zone, instructing them to take emergency measures to lead the people in preventing wind and floods. The cadres received the telegram at twelve o'clock at night and immediately held a meeting overnight to take action, and at three o'clock in the morning, they went to the coastal areas to lead the people in rushing to harvest. By the time the wind rose and the water rose, the August rice and sweet potatoes in the coastal Vinh Giang, Vinh Thai and other villages had been rushed to harvest, and only one *mu* was flooded. The masses in the northern demilitarized zone and nearby areas all said: "President Ho, the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Democratic Republic government love the people more than our own parents."
    Leaving the demilitarized zone and going north for three or four kilometers, you reach a brand-new town formed by the connection of two residential points, Ta Hien and Ho Xa. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of this area. Previously, this was only a stronghold of the French colonial army, with a total of only fifteen households and sixty-one people in both places; now it has increased to five hundred and seventy-eight households and one thousand seven hundred and eleven people. There are already more than 150 industrial and commercial households in the town, a state-owned trading company department store, a forest and local product purchase and sales office, a public-private joint venture wood factory with eighty-two employees, and an agricultural tool factory with forty-eight employees. A junior high school and an enlightenment school, a bookstore, two cultural centers, two amateur cultural troupes, and a hospital that can accommodate two hundred patients have also been established. This hospital also regularly admits patients and lying-in women from south of the 17th parallel, providing them with free treatment, and people with difficult lives also receive special care.
    Some of the residents of Ta Hien-Ho Xa are those who withdrew from the South with the Vietnamese People's Army during the regrouping period, and some are those who later escaped from the South because they could not bear the oppression and devastation of the Ngo Dinh Diem government. People are all happy to be living a peaceful life here today.
    Le Vinh and Le Hong, who escaped from Huong Dien commune in Huong Hoa district, Quang Tri province, bitterly denounced the crime of Ngo Dinh Diem's army inhumanly massacring ninety-two men, women, old and young people in Tan Lap and Tan Hiep villages in Huong Dien commune in July this year. Le Vinh, Le Hong, and Nguyen Thi Van, a woman who had arrived in Hanoi earlier, are the only few survivors of these two villages. Similar massacres are taking place in various parts of South Vietnam, south of the 17th parallel.
    In Ta Hien-Ho Xa, we also met a woman, Kieu Thi Tinh, who had just escaped from Saigon after experiencing many hardships. She excitedly recounted her escape, saying: "Rather than living in fear there, I would rather take a risk and come here to live in peace of mind." The reporter also encountered a visiting delegation to the North organized spontaneously by the people of the South. The head of this visiting delegation said: "Facts are the best proof. Over the past year, the North has repaired several railways, several large water gates, and the Hong Gai coal mine, the Hai Phong cement plant, and the Nam Dinh textile factory have also been restored and put into operation. What has the South done in the past year?"
    From here, people can clearly see that although the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and its American masters use all kinds of barbarous means to try to divide the land of Vietnam, what way do they have to divide the hearts of the Vietnamese people? Whether in the north or south of the 17th parallel, the Vietnamese people unanimously demand the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords and the realization of the peaceful reunification of their motherland. There is such a story: The people living south of the provisional military demarcation line have proposed to the delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army six times to make the flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam – the Golden Star Red Flag – erected on the north bank of the Ben Hai River, bigger, bigger, bigger, higher, higher, higher. They said: "This is a flag for us southerners." Many families get up early every morning and look far towards the flagpole in the north, because this flag represents their sacred desire to build a peaceful, unified, independent, prosperous and strong Vietnam on their own land.

    十七度线南北
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    在越南地图上的北纬十七度线附近，静静地躺着一条从越南和老挝边境的山林里流过来的不很大的河流——贤良江。日内瓦协议所规定的越南临时军事分界线，主要是沿着这条河划分的。沿江两岸各约三公里至五公里的地方，划成非军事区。按照规定，在南、北两边非军事区里，只允许有关一方常驻一百名民警和公安人员，负责地方上社会治安事宜，绝对禁止一切军事性的行动。
    在向越南中央联合停战委员会办妥了手续后，我进入了军事区访问。站在贤良江边，可以看到一幅多么强烈的对照的画面啊！同是在一片国土上，同是在一个太阳的照耀下，可是贤良江南、北两岸却是两个完全不同的世界。向北一望，处处都可以看到安居乐业和恢复建设的景象，田野里人们在耕作，水牛在收割了的田边吃草，不时地发出长鸣。入夜，村庄里灯光点点，到处响起了歌声。在这里，人们可以时常看到电影和业余文工团的演出，有时还看到从首都河内来的艺术家们的精采节目。
    了望贤良江南岸，却是一片死也似的沉寂。几幢阴森的铁皮房子，其中有一座比较高的碉堡式的屋顶上，挂着一面吴庭艳的黄底加上三道黑杠的旗子，几个外籍兵打着赤膊在江边洗澡或者在洗刷着什么。原野里几乎看不见有人行走。夜晚，除了桥头的铁皮房子里射出来一点灯光外，贤良江南岸是一片漆黑，时而传来几响凄厉的枪声。住在南边非军事区里的人，时刻耽心着自己的命运。据统计：自八月三日至十月二十四日，吴庭艳武装力量侵入非军事区共七十三次，每次少则二、三人，多至一百八十人。在这两个多月里，他们在南边非军事区内杀死了居民一人，打伤了一百一十三人（其中五人被枪伤），抓走了一百九十九人，还抢走了居民的大批钱财、布匹、猪、鸡、鸭等等财物。从十月起，吴庭艳集团更在所谓“征求民意”的借口下，在南边的非军事区里组织武装“秩序队”；又以“防疫检查”为名，派人到居民家里去挨户搜查、捕捉赞成协商统一的人。
    在北边非军事区，我们自由地参观和访问了一些地方。这里原来是相当贫瘠的地区，向有“狗吃石、鸡吃盐”之称。可是和平恢复后，在越南民主共和国政府的关怀和帮助下，人民连获三季丰收。过去每年缺四个月食粮的穆村，今年也够吃了。在这短短的一年多时间内，共和国政府领导北边非军事区人民修筑了共长七公里多的大堤，使二千多亩（中越亩，每亩约合中国七亩多。下同）田地免遭海水的浸淹，并且普遍发展了小型水利事业，挖掘了二百十五条水沟，保证了五千三百多亩稻田的用水。在我们到达前不久，一条可以灌溉七百亩稻田的边站水渠刚竣工，非军事区里人民两千多人举行了热闹的庆祝会。位于非军事区的海港——松门一带的渔民，在民主共和国的贷款帮助下，修整渔船，恢复了生产，渔民生活都有改善。每当休息时，渔民们便集合在松门的沙滩上，张起网来打排球。松门附近的集市，不久前曾被吴庭艳特务放火烧掉了许多房子，现在却更热闹了。这里的松门小学正在兴建一座新校舍，我们到达时还没有完工。
    人们谈起了许多动人的故事。今秋台风来袭的时候，越南劳动党中央和越南民主共和国政府向非军事区党政领导机关发来电报，指示他们采取紧急措施领导人民防风防水。干部们在深夜十二点接到电报，立即漏夜开会采取行动，清晨三点钟就分头下到了沿海地区，领导人民抢收。等到风起水涨的时候，沿海的永江、永泰等乡的八月稻和红薯都已抢收完毕，只有一亩被淹。北边非军事区和附近一带的群众都说：“胡主席、越南劳动党和民主共和国政府爱人民，比我们亲生父母还亲。”
    离开非军事区，北走三、四公里，就到了由左弦和湖舍两个居民点联结成的一个崭新的市镇。它是这一带的政治、经济和文化的中心。以前这里只是法国殖民军的据点，两处一共只有十五户、六十一口人；现在已增加到五百七十八户、一千七百十一口人了。镇上已有一百五十多家工商业户、一个国营贸易公司百货门市部和一个林土产购销处、一个公私合营的拥有八十二名职工的木工厂和一个拥有四十八名职工的农具工厂，还设立了一座初级中学和一座启蒙学校、一家书店、两处文化馆、两个业余文工团以及一个可以收容二百位病人的医院。这个医院，还经常收容来自十七度线以南的病人和产妇，给予他们免费的治疗，生活困难的人还得到特别的照顾。
    左弦——湖舍市的居民中，有些是集结时期随越南人民军从南方撤离出来的，有些是后来因为不堪吴庭艳政府的压迫摧残，从南方逃出来的。人们都为今天能在这里过着和平生活而感到高兴。
    从广治省香化县的香田乡逃出来的黎营和黎洪，悲愤地控诉了吴庭艳军队在今年七月毫无人性地把香田乡新立村和新协村的男女老少九十二人全部惨杀的罪行。黎营、黎洪以及先到河内的妇女阮氏云等，是这两个村仅有的几个侥幸的脱难者。类似这样的惨杀案，正在北纬十七度线以南的越南南方各地发生着。
    我们在左弦—湖舍市，还会见了一位经历许多艰险，刚从西贡脱逃出来的妇女乔氏静。她非常兴奋地叙述了自己逃难的经过，她说：“与其在那边心惊胆颤地过日子，不如冒一次险，到这边来安安心心地生活。”记者还遇到了一个南方人民自动组织的到北方各地来观光的参观访问团。这个参观访问团的团长说：“事实是最好的证明。一年来，北方已经把几条铁路修起来了，把几个大水闸修好了，鸿基煤矿、海防水泥厂和南定纺织厂也都修复开工了。一年来南方做了什么？”
    从这里，人们可以清楚地看到，尽管吴庭艳集团和它的美国老板使用各种野蛮的手段想把越南的土地分割开来，但是它又有什么办法分割越南人民的心呢？无论在十七度线的北方或南方，越南人民都是一致地要求彻底执行日内瓦协议，实现他们祖国的和平统一。有这样的故事：居住在临时军事分界线南方的人民，曾经六次向越南人民军代表团提出建议，要求把竖立在贤良江北岸的越南民主共和国国旗——金星红旗，做得大些、大些、再大些，挂得高些、高些、再高些。他们说：“这是给我们南面人挂的旗。”许多人家每天清早起来，都朝着北方的旗杆上遥望，因为这面旗帜，代表着他们的一定要在自己的土地上建立起一个和平、统一、独立、富强的越南的神圣的愿望。
