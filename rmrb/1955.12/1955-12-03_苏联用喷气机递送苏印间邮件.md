Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 2nd: Soviet journalists accompanying the Soviet leaders on their trip can receive mail from Moscow in Delhi within eight hours, including the day's "Pravda." This mail is being transported from Moscow to Tashkent in one hour by jet aircraft, and then from there, following the same route taken by the Soviet leaders, i.e., via Kabul across the Hindu Kush mountains, to Delhi or Bombay in seven hours. This new route greatly shortens the distance between the Soviet Union and India.

    苏联用喷气机递送苏印间邮件
    新华社新德里二日电　随同苏联领袖们进行采访的苏联记者可以在八小时之内收到从莫斯科寄到德里的邮件，包括当天的“真理报”。这种邮件正由喷气式飞机从莫斯科用一小时的时间运到塔什干，然后再从那里用七小时的时间经过苏联领袖们所走的同一路线，即经由喀布尔越过兴都库什山脉运到德里或孟买。这条新航线大大缩短了苏印两国之间的距离。
