Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd—The National Relief Work Conference was held in Beijing from November 18th to 30th.

    The conference believed that the rural disaster relief work in 1955 was a great success. Because of the rare flood in a century in 1954, the task of disaster relief in the first half of 1955 was very heavy. Therefore, the Party and government leadership attached great importance to rural disaster relief work this year, and timely helped the disaster victims to rebuild their homes and restore production. In the second half of this year, the newly affected areas actively led the disaster victims to develop production for self-salvation and provided timely relief to the disaster victims. Some old disaster areas paid attention to disaster prevention while doing disaster relief work, and also achieved certain results.

    The conference summarized the experience of how disaster relief work relies on agricultural producers' cooperatives, how disaster relief work is under unified leadership and overall planning, how to make reasonable use of relief funds and properly distribute them, and how to strengthen disaster prevention while doing a good job in disaster relief.

    The conference believed that the rural disaster relief work in 1956 must further rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, carry out overall planning, and implement the policy of production for disaster relief. First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of spring and summer famine relief work in some areas, so that all tasks can be properly arranged before the spring famine arrives. Secondly, launch a production self-salvation movement centered on agricultural producers' cooperatives. Thirdly, give full play to the supporting role of national relief forces for the disaster victims, and actively cooperate with relevant departments to earnestly do a good job in mass disaster prevention and disaster relief work.

    In terms of rural social relief work, the conference believed that in the future, it should further understand and grasp the situation of poor households in combination with the central work, and actively participate in organizing poor households to join agricultural producers' cooperatives. Give full play to the role of relief funds and help poor households who join the cooperative to solve their living difficulties. For poor households who cannot yet join the cooperative, it is necessary to organize them to engage in production that they can handle as much as possible and pay attention to necessary relief. The conference pointed out that in 1956, we should continue to do a good job in relief work in old revolutionary base areas and ethnic minority areas.

    This conference also summarized the urban relief work in 1955 and studied the work tasks for 1956. The conference believed that in order to meet the needs of urban socialist construction and socialist transformation, the urban social relief work in 1956 should focus on the planned shelter and transformation of vagrants in the city who do not engage in production, so that they can engage in agricultural production or other labor production. Continue to organize the poor to participate in the service-oriented production of processing for factories and mining enterprises. The existing poor people's production units and the production units of production and education institutions should be rectified and incorporated into the track of local economic plans. Civil affairs departments at all levels should also actively cooperate in organizing urban poor people to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, and do a good job in the relief and education of disabled, old and weak residents.

    全国救济工作会议研究了明年工作任务
    据新华社二日讯　全国救济工作会议十一月十八日到三十日在北京举行。
    会议认为一九五五年的农村救灾工作是有很大成绩的。因为一九五四年曾经发生百年来少有的洪水，留给一九五五年上半年救灾工作的任务很繁重，所以党和政府的领导方面今年对农村救灾工作都很重视，及时帮助灾民重建家园，恢复了生产。今年下半年，有新灾的地区都积极领导灾民展开生产自救的工作，并且及时对灾民进行了救济。有些老灾区在进行救灾工作的同时，还注意了防灾工作，也取得一定成绩。
    会议总结了救灾工作如何依靠农业生产合作社，救灾工作如何统一领导、全面规划，如何使救济款合理使用、发放得当以及在做好救灾工作的同时如何加强防灾工作等方面的经验。
    会议认为，一九五六年的农村救灾工作必须进一步依靠互助合作组织，进行全面规划，贯彻执行生产救灾的方针。首先必须加强对一些地区的春荒、夏荒救济工作的领导，使各项工作在春荒没有到来之前就给以妥善的安排。其次，开展以农业生产合作社为中心的生产自救运动。再次，要充分发挥国家救济力量对灾民的支持作用，还要积极配合有关部门切实做好群众性的防灾和抢救灾荒工作。
    在农村社会救济工作方面，会议认为，今后应该结合中心工作进一步了解和掌握贫困户的情况，积极参加组织贫困户加入农业生产合作社的工作。充分发挥救济款的作用，帮助入社贫困户解决生活困难。对目前还不能入社的贫困户，要尽可能地组织他们从事力能胜任的生产，并且注意必要的救济。会议指出，一九五六年还应当继续做好对革命老根据地和少数民族地区的救济工作。
    这次会议还总结了一九五五年的城市救济工作和研究了一九五六年的工作任务。会议认为，为了适应城市的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的需要，一九五六年的城市社会救济工作，要着重对城市中不事生产的游民有计划地进行收容改造，使他们从事农业生产或其他劳动生产。继续组织贫民参加为厂矿企业单位加工的服务性的生产，对已有的贫民生产单位和生产教养机关的生产单位应该加以整顿，使之纳入当地经济计划的轨道。各级民政部门还要积极配合组织城市贫民下乡参加农业生产，要做好对残废老弱居民的救济和教养工作。
