Guangdong farmers are actively protecting cattle through the winter
In order to avoid the large number of cattle deaths during the winter, agricultural departments in various parts of Guangdong Province have strengthened their leadership in protecting cattle through the winter. Since November, forty-two counties across the province have successively convened meetings of agricultural production cooperative directors, experienced farmers, and feeders to discuss protecting cattle through the winter, mobilizing the masses to repair pens, store grass, and promote advanced feeding methods. After the establishment of a livestock care group and the formulation of a cattle protection agreement in Houpo Village, Lufeng County, the 157 cattle in the village had an average of more than 1,740 catties of fodder stored per head. More than 300 cattle sheds in Chao'an County and Zhongshan County have been repaired. Nanhaixian's Xianggang District held a cattle health competition, organized more than 600 farmers to observe and compare, exchange cattle-raising experiences, and selected cattle-raising models, deeply educating some farmers who usually did not pay attention to cattle maintenance. Yangjiang County also promoted the "one cow, one quilt" movement (covering the cattle with rags or burlap bags) to protect young livestock. It is estimated that the province's more than 4.2 million cattle will generally be able to safely survive the winter this year. (Li Shaoqiu)

    广东农民积极保护耕牛过冬
    广东省各地农业部门为了避免冬季耕牛大量伤亡的现象，加强了保护耕牛过冬工作的领导。从十一月以来，全省已经有四十二个县先后召集农业生产合作社主任、老农、饲养员举行了保护耕牛过冬会议，发动群众修栏，贮草，推广先进的饲养方法。陆丰县后坡村成立爱畜小组，订立护牛公约以后，全村一百五十七头耕牛，平均每头牛已经贮备草料一千七百四十多斤。潮安县、中山县有三百多间牛舍经过了修补。南海县?岗区举行了耕牛健康比赛，组织六百多个农民观摩评比，交流养牛经验，并且选出了养牛模范，一些平常不注意保养耕牛的农民也受到了深刻的教育。阳江县还推行了“一牛一被”运动（用破布或麻包盖护牛体），以保护幼畜。预计全省四百二十多万头耕牛，今年一般都可安全度过寒冬。（李少球）
