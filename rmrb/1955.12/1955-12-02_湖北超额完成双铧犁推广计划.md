Hubei Exceeds Target for Double-Share Plow Promotion Plan

    Since the start of winter sowing this year, Hubei Province has promoted more than 15,000 double-wheeled double-share plows, exceeding the original plan by a quarter. The approximately 2,000 double-wheeled double-share plows currently being manufactured and transferred from other provinces have also been fully ordered by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various regions.

    Hubei Province experienced a prolonged autumn drought this year. The double-wheeled double-share plow can plow eight or nine mu of land per day in hardened soil, which is three or four times more efficient than the old plow. Therefore, it is welcomed by farmers. Many agricultural production cooperatives in Echeng County bought more than 700 double-wheeled double-share plows in one week, which is nearly twenty times more than the total number promoted in the county last year. After the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Qianjin Township in Tianmen County found it difficult to plow with old plows, they bought five double-wheeled double-share plows and plowed more than 680 mu in half a month, completing the winter sowing plan ahead of schedule, and also saving more than 400 yuan in labor and cattle costs compared to using old plows.

    湖北超额完成双铧犁推广计划
    湖北省今年冬播以来，已推广了双轮双铧犁一万五千多部，超过原计划四分之一。目前正在赶制和由外省调拨的约二千部双轮双铧犁，也已被各地农业生产合作社和互助组定购完了。
    湖北省今年发生了长时间的秋旱，双轮双铧犁在土壤板结的田地里，每天能翻耕八、九亩地，比旧犁的效能高三、四倍，因此受到农民欢迎。鄂城县的许多农业生产合作社，在一个星期里，就买了七百多部双轮双铧犁，比去年全县推广的总数多了将近二十倍。天门县前进乡的第一农业生产合作社用旧犁翻耕不动，买了五部双轮双铧犁以后，半个月翻耕了六百八十多亩，提前完成了冬播计划，还比用旧犁节省了四百多元的人工和牛工费。（袁军）
