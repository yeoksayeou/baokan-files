Ceaușescu emphasized that in view of the Party’s task of assuming the leadership and guidance of the people and the people’s democratic state in the conditions of transition from capitalism to socialism, some of the contents of the Party Charter adopted by the Romanian Workers' Party's 1948 Congress were outdated. Taking this into consideration and based on the experience accumulated by the Party, it was necessary to make certain revisions and supplements to the Party Charter to ensure the necessary organizational forms and working methods, and to raise all organizational work and the Party's political work to a level commensurate with the great tasks facing the Party at the present stage.

    After discussing Ceaușescu's report, the delegates unanimously approved the draft revised Charter of the Romanian Workers' Party.

    At the meetings on the 26th and 27th, representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties from various countries delivered congratulatory messages to the Congress.
