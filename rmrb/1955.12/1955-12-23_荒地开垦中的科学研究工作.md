Scientific Research Work in Wasteland Reclamation
Song Daquan, Deputy Director of the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    In the First Five-Year Plan, wasteland reclamation is also listed as an important measure for increasing agricultural production, with the aim of increasing production by expanding cultivated land area. Although the increase in production from wasteland reclamation is currently small, China's wasteland resources are very rich. According to preliminary estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture, the total area of wasteland in the country is about 1.5 billion mu, of which several hundred million mu are in relatively good condition, some requiring no improvement and others requiring only slight improvement before they can be utilized. China has a large area of reclaimable wasteland, so it is possible to rapidly increase agricultural production figures. In a few years, China will be able to manufacture its own tractors and harvesters, and agricultural organization and technology will also be greatly improved. After detailed surveys and planning of wasteland resources, the large-scale development of wasteland will promote the leap-forward development of China's agricultural production and construction.
    In recent years, in order to develop production, the state has carried out wasteland surveys and reclamation in many regions. For example, in the wasteland of the saline-alkali soil areas of northern Jiangsu, surveys were conducted first to study the physical and chemical properties of the soil and to summarize the years of wasteland reclamation experience in the saline-alkali reclamation area of northern Jiangsu. Scientific research departments have established soil improvement experiment stations in this area to conduct saline-alkali soil improvement experiments, providing scientific data for the cultivation, drainage, fertilization, and selection of suitable crops for saline-alkali soil, turning large areas of saline-alkali wasteland in northern Jiangsu into fields for producing cotton and grain. When mapping the distribution of saline-alkali soil, observing plant communities and making field salinity measurements can quickly and accurately determine the distribution of soil salinity, serving as a basis for reclamation and suitable utilization. Scientific research has also done a lot of work on the utilization and improvement of red soil wasteland in South China, such as the application of apatite powder and the planting of green manure crops, which have significantly improved the fertility of red soil. The Jiangxi Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences has achieved good results in planting fruit trees, tung oil trees, and other crops on red soil wasteland. These experimental research works have accumulated good scientific practical experience for the utilization and development of large areas of red soil wasteland in South China. In the cultivation of technical crops after the reclamation of red soil wasteland in South China, the initial investment in purchasing fertilizers was very large. Later, green manure was cultivated locally to make compost, mixed with apatite powder for application, and bacterial fertilizers were appropriately applied, so that the main sources of fertilizer could be solved locally, saving the country tens of millions of yuan in fertilizer purchase costs each year. On the other hand, a comprehensive survey of the natural conditions in the subtropical areas of South China was carried out, and a series of investigations and studies were conducted on the habits, selection, physiological properties, cultivation methods of tropical crops, and the mechanical and manual reclamation methods of wasteland, the establishment of shelterbelts, and the cultivation of cover and green manure crops, clarifying that the red soil wasteland must be utilized in a variety of ways according to local conditions. In recent years, many state-owned farms and reclamation farms have been established in the red soil wasteland area, developing a variety of new crops, such as sisal hemp, pineapple, citronella, coffee, coconut, pepper, etc., and closely combining them with rice cultivation and animal husbandry, turning many formerly barren red soil areas into progressive enterprises in socialist form. In terms of the introduction of tropical crops, the cultivation area has been pushed northward by hundreds of kilometers. The above facts show that a series of scientific researches carried out in wasteland reclamation have great significance for the socialist agricultural production of the motherland; and show that Michurin's biological science has initially played its role in the great cause of transforming nature in our country.
    In recent years, comprehensive soil surveys have been conducted in the northeast and eastern Inner Mongolia, and the soil types and natural conditions in this area have been preliminarily studied, the main soil problems have been identified, and preliminary research and estimation have also been done on wasteland resources. The total area of wasteland in the Northeast is about 10 million hectares, half of which is distributed in the black soil and gray forest soil areas, some of which are swamp soils, and other wasteland is distributed in saline-alkali soil and sandy soil areas. Due to different soil types, natural conditions vary greatly. The development of large areas of saline-alkali soil, swamp soil, and sandy soil belongs to the long-term work of transforming nature. These works have been studied by the relevant research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
    The survey work of the Friendship Farm was first carried out in 1952 by a working team jointly formed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant industrial departments and schools. At that time, the Soviet grid measurement method was used to conduct soil vegetation surveys, and agricultural meteorological and water conservancy data were collected to make preliminary plans. This method shortened the working speed by one-half to two-thirds compared with the old method of investigation, and at the same time, it could give play to the collective creativity. In the winter of 1954, China decided to build a large-scale grain farm here, and the Soviet government also sent a land consolidation team to assist in the survey and construction of the farm. They collected basic data in all aspects. After comprehensive整理 and discussion of the various basic data, land consolidation experts carried out on-farm and in-farm design and planning, and finally completed the land consolidation design drawings and instructions for the Friendship Farm. The entire area of 32,000 hectares was arranged for large-field crop rotation and pasture rotation according to soil, hydrological, and agricultural characteristics. A small part of the swamp soil and saline soil that cannot be utilized at present was also designated as grass-cutting fields and pastures, so that all the land could be put into production. Soviet experts are very enthusiastic and prudent in carrying out survey and design. The survey and planning work carried out by Soviet experts at the Friendship Farm tells us that a comprehensive scientific research method, a high level of Marxism-Leninism, strict organizational discipline, and a high level of scientific expertise are the basic conditions for doing a good job in wasteland survey and planning.
    In the northwest and southwest regions of China, wasteland resources are also very rich. The military reclamation in Xinjiang Province has been very successful. After building reservoirs and diverting water canals for irrigation, large areas of wasteland have been turned into fertile fields, and cotton has achieved extremely high yields. At present, there are still tens of millions of mu of good wasteland available for reclamation. In the Tibetan Plateau of China, the original agriculture and animal husbandry were very backward. With the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Chinese Tibetan Science Team introduced a variety of vegetables and crops such as wheat after conducting natural resource surveys, and achieved good results after testing. Therefore, it is possible to rapidly cultivate the original wasteland on the plateau to develop state-owned farms and pastures. This will open up new resources for the motherland and will also enable the living standards and cultural levels of the Tibetan people to be rapidly improved. In addition, large areas of wasteland in the Qaidam Basin, the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and the Songpan Grassland are being surveyed and reclaimed.
    Based on the above situation, the potential of wasteland reclamation in China is very large. To do a good job in wasteland survey and planning and reclamation, a series of comprehensive scientific research and experimental work must be carried out. This requires learning from the scientific theories and practical experience of the Soviet Union. At present, China has begun to establish state-owned farms in wasteland areas and carry out large-scale wasteland survey and planning work. It is expected that China will find 200 to 300 million mu of reclaimable wasteland with better conditions. The reclamation of the remaining large areas of wasteland must be combined with the work of transforming nature. Scientific research departments must combine natural resource surveys and productivity surveys to conduct a general survey and compile national geological maps, soil maps, vegetation maps, climate regional maps, and geographical regional maps, all at a scale of one millionth. According to the proposal of Academician Gerasimov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences: To do a good job in the national natural zoning and economic zoning, we must concentrate our efforts on doing these basic works well; at the same time, field investigation work must be closely combined with indoor research work, such as soil, geography, and Quaternary geology, indoor research work must be strengthened, and scientific work stations must be established in different natural areas to carry out comprehensive experimental research on soil, plants, agriculture, forestry, and soil improvement. In addition, scientific research departments should also assist agricultural departments in training a large number of scientific and technical cadres needed for wasteland survey and wasteland reclamation to improve work quality and create methods that are conducive to production. Agricultural departments should concentrate their efforts on carrying out survey and planning work in key wasteland areas, and should mainly be composed of soil, agriculture, surveying, and land consolidation personnel. In addition to establishing field survey teams, laboratories and drawing rooms should also be set up to coordinate the work. Other personnel such as hydrogeology, plants, and water conservancy can be invited from relevant research institutions. Agricultural scientific research departments should also attach importance to and specifically participate in the experimental research work of wasteland survey planning and utilization improvement. The allocation of various professional personnel should be as appropriate as possible. In the initial stage of wasteland survey and planning work, a steady approach should be adopted. In recent years, in participating in wasteland survey and design and carrying out research on newly reclaimed wasteland, I have deeply realized that the survey and utilization of wasteland must be closely coordinated with scientific research. Especially for the development of large areas of wasteland, a comprehensive and detailed survey and scientific research work must be carried out first to solve a series of problems in wasteland reclamation and to ensure that the newly reclaimed wasteland can guarantee high yields. Scientific workers engaged in wasteland reclamation must have the spirit of hard work and endurance, be good at applying advanced Soviet scientific methods, and tap the valuable practical experience of Chinese farmers. Comprehensive investigation and research must be carried out by a group of scientific researchers in many aspects, and be led by personnel with a higher level of scientific expertise and who can master the Marxist-Leninist scientific method. Industrial departments should attach importance to scientific research, on the one hand, cooperate closely with relevant scientific departments to give play to collective strength, and on the other hand, absorb scientific researchers to enhance leadership. They should provide favorable conditions for scientific research in their work and reduce the administrative and office work of researchers. All kinds of data and specimens obtained from the survey and required for scientific research should be fully provided to scientific personnel for in-depth research in order to solve practical problems.

    荒地开垦中的科学研究工作
    中国科学院林业土壤研究所副所长　宋达泉
    在第一个五年计划中，荒地开垦也列为农业增产的重要措施之一。以扩大耕地面积，达到增产的目的。虽然目前在荒地开垦方面的增产数字很小，但我国的荒地资源是很丰富的。据农业部的初步估计，全国荒地总面积约有十五亿亩，其中条件较好的有几亿亩，有的不需改良，有的只要稍加改良就能利用。我国既有大面积的可垦荒地，所以农业增产数字的迅速提高，是有可能的。几年后，我国能自制拖拉机及收获机，农业组织和技术也大大提高，荒地资源也经过详细的勘察规划，那时展开大规模开垦荒地的工作，将促使我国的农业生产建设飞跃进步。
    近几年来，国家为了发展生产，在许多地区进行了荒地的勘测和开垦。如苏北盐土区荒地，先进行了勘测，研究土壤的理化特性，并总结了苏北盐垦区多年来垦荒的经验。科学研究部门在这个地区设立了土壤改良试验站，进行盐土改良试验，为盐土的耕作、排水、施肥、选种适宜作物提供了科学资料，使苏北大片的盐荒地，变为生产棉粮的田地。在测制盐土分布图时，从植物群落的观察并作田间的盐分测定，能迅速并准确地判定土壤的盐分分布情况，作为开垦和适宜利用的依据。对华南红壤荒地的利用和改良，科学研究方面也做了不少的工作，如磷灰石粉的施用和栽种绿肥作物，都对提高红壤的肥力起了显著的作用。江西省农业科学研究所利用红壤荒地栽种果树、油桐和其他作物，都获得良好的结果。这些试验研究工作，为华南大面积红壤荒地的利用、开发，积累了良好的科学实践经验。在华南红壤荒地开垦后栽培技术作物上，最初在购买肥料方面的投资很大，以后就地培育绿肥制成堆肥，混合磷灰石粉施用，并且适当地应用了细菌肥料，使主要的肥源都能就地解决，使国家每年节约了数千万元购买肥料的费用。另一方面，对华南亚热带地区的自然条件进行了综合调查，并对热带作物的习性、选种、生理性质、栽培方法及荒地的机械和人工开垦方法，防护林的建立，覆盖和绿肥作物的培育等方面，进行了一系列的调查研究，明确认识了红壤荒地须要因地制宜作多方面的利用。几年来红壤荒地区已建立了很多的国营农场和垦殖场，发展了多种新作物，如剑麻、菠萝、香茅、咖啡、椰子、胡椒等，并且同水稻栽培和家畜饲养业密切结合，使许多过去荒芜的红壤地区，已变为社会主义形式的进步企业。在热带作物的引种方面，栽培地区已向北推进数百公里。以上的事实说明，在荒地开垦中所进行的一系列的科学研究，对祖国社会主义的农业生产有着极大的意义；并且说明，米丘林生物科学在我国改造自然的伟大事业中已经初步发挥了它的作用。
    几年来，在东北和内蒙古东部地区进行了综合性的土壤调查，初步研究了这一地区的土壤类型和自然条件，找出了主要的土壤问题，同时对荒地资源也做了初步的研究和估计。东北荒地总面积约一千万公顷，半数分布在黑土和灰化土区，其中一部分为沼泽土，其他荒地分布于盐碱土和砂土区。因土类不同，自然条件差别很大。大面积盐碱土、沼泽土和砂土的开发是属于长远的改造自然的工作。这些工作已由中国科学院的有关研究机构进行研究。
    国营友谊农场的勘察工作，是一九五二年由中国科学院同有关产业部门、学校合组的工作队首先进行的。当时采用了苏联方格测量方法，进行土壤植被的调查，并收集农业气象、水利等资料，做了初步规划。这种方法在工作速度上比用旧法调查缩短了二分之一到三分之二的时间，同时能发挥集体的创造性。一九五四年冬季，我国决定在这里建立大型谷物农场，苏联政府也派了土地整理工作组前来协助勘察建场工作。他们收集了各方面的基本资料。在对各项基本资料进行综合整理和讨论后，由土地整理专家进行场间和场内的设计规划，最后完成了友谊农场的土地整理设计图和说明书。全场三万二千公顷的面积都根据土壤、水文、和农业特性布置了大田轮作和牧草轮作，小部分目前不能被利用的沼泽土和盐渍土，也划为割草场和放牧场，使全部土地都能投入生产。苏联专家们对进行勘察设计是非常热情和审慎的。从苏联专家在友谊农场所进行的勘察规划工作告诉我们：综合性的科学研究方法，高度的马克思列宁主义水平，严密的组织纪律，以及高度的科学水平，是做好荒地勘察规划工作的基本条件。
    在我国西北和西南地区，荒地的资源也是很丰富的。新疆省的军垦，是很有成绩的。大面积的荒地，在修建蓄水池和引水渠进行灌溉以后，都变为良田，并使棉花达到极高的产量。目前还有几千万亩良好的荒地可供开垦。在我国的西藏高原，原有的农、牧业都很落后。随着西藏的和平解放，我国的西藏科学工作队，在进行自然资源勘察后，引种了多种蔬菜及小麦等作物，经过试验后，获得良好的成绩。因此使高原上的原始荒地，有可能迅速地进行垦种，以发展国营农牧场。这就为祖国开辟了新的富源，也将使藏族人民的生活和文化水平，能够迅速地提高。此外如柴达木盆地、黄河中游及松潘草地的大片荒原，都正在勘察和开垦。
    根据以上的情况，我国荒地开垦的潜在力是很大的。要做好荒地的勘察规划和开垦工作，必须进行一系列的综合性的科学研究和试验工作。这就必须学习苏联的科学理论和实践经验。目前我国开始在荒地区建立国营农场和进行大规模的荒地勘察规划工作，预计我国除可找出二、三亿亩条件较好的可垦荒地外，其余大面积的荒地开垦要同改造自然的工作结合起来进行。科学研究部门必须结合自然资源勘测和生产力调查工作进行普查，并编制全国百万分之一的地质图、土壤图、植被图、气候区域图和地理区域图等。根据苏联科学院格拉西莫夫院士的建议：要做好全国的自然区划和经济区划，必须集中力量做好这些基本工作；同时野外调查工作必须密切同室内研究工作相结合，如土壤、地理及第四纪地质方面都须加强室内研究工作，并在不同的自然区域设立科学工作站，进行土壤、植物、农业、林业和土壤改良方面的综合性试验研究工作。此外，科学研究部门还应协助农业部门培养大量的荒地勘察和开垦荒地所需的科学工作干部，以提高工作质量，并创造有利于生产的方法。农业部门应该集中力量在重点的荒地区域进行勘察规划工作，并且应该以土壤、农业、测量和土地整理的人员为主体。除了成立野外的勘察队外，也要设立化验室和绘图室配合工作。其他如水文地质、植物、水利等人员可邀请有关的研究机构担任。农业科学研究部门也应该重视并具体参加荒地勘察规划和利用改良的试验研究工作。关于各种专业人员力量的配备应力求适当。在初期进行荒地勘察规划工作，应该采取稳步前进的办法。几年来，在参加荒地勘察设计及进行新垦荒地的研究工作中，使我深深体会到荒地的勘察和利用，必须密切配合科学研究。尤其是大片荒地的开发，必须先进行全面的和细致深入的勘察和科学研究工作，才能解决开垦荒地中一系列的问题，并且使新垦的荒地能保证丰产丰收。从事荒地开垦的科学工作人员，必须具有刻苦耐劳的精神，善于运用苏联先进的科学方法，并且发掘我国农民宝贵的实践经验。进行综合性的调查研究，必须集合多方面的科学研究人员，并且由科学水平较高、能掌握马克思列宁主义科学方法的人员担任领导工作。产业部门应该重视科学研究，一方面同有关的科学部门密切合作，发挥集体力量，同时也要吸收科学研究人员，增强领导力量；在工作上要给予科学研究以有利的条件，减少研究人员的行政及事务工作。关于调查所得及科学研究所需的各种资料标本，应充分供给科学人员进行深入研究，以便解决实际问题。
