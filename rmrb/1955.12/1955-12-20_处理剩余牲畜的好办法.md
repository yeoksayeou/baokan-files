After the establishment and expansion of agricultural cooperatives in the Third District of Andong County, Liaoning Province, the entire district was left with over 1,200 head of young livestock and old and weak draft animals that were difficult to handle. The leading cadres and members of the agricultural cooperatives felt very troubled. Based on the production needs and economic conditions of the cooperatives, the leading cadres of the agricultural cooperatives believed that it was not possible to buy or rent these livestock. The members all felt that since both people and land had joined the cooperatives, it would be very difficult for individuals to raise livestock on their own.

The Third District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Andong County promptly paid attention to this issue. After convening the leading cadres of various agricultural cooperatives for discussions and conducting multiple studies, they proposed several ways to deal with the young livestock and old and weak draft animals remaining after farmers joined the cooperatives: 1. Purchase them by the cooperative at a set price; 2. Retain private ownership by the members, but the cooperative will manage the unified grazing, with the original owner bearing the cost of the grazing worker based on the number of draft animals; 3. Currently, discount the value and consider it as an investment by the members in the cooperative, without interest. After they grow up, the cooperative will sell them or keep them for use, with the excess over the original discounted value to be divided between the cooperative and the original owner through negotiation; 4. Organize year-round fertilizer accumulation groups.

Based on these methods, all agricultural cooperatives in the district properly handled the surplus young livestock and old and weak draft animals of the members in conjunction with their production plans. The He Ping Agricultural Cooperative in Dahe Village, which had a surplus of more than 60 head of livestock, organized two herds of cattle using the method of private ownership with communal feeding. Some other cooperatives adopted the method of purchasing them for the cooperative, while others organized year-round fertilizer accumulation groups. In this way, the surplus young livestock and old and weak draft animals all found a way out, and the members were very satisfied with this method of handling.

    处理剩余牲畜的好办法
    辽宁省安东县第三区在建社扩社后，全区剩余了一千二百多头幼畜和老弱耕畜没法处理。农业合作社的领导骨干和社员都感到很为难。农业合作社的领导骨干根据社里的生产需要和经济条件认为不能收买或租用这批牲畜，社员们都认为人和土地都入了社，个人再饲养牲畜有很大困难。
    中共安东县第三区区委及时注意了这个问题，经过召集各个农业合作社的领导骨干进行座谈和多次研究，对农民入社后剩余的幼畜和老弱耕畜提出了几个处理的办法：一、作价由社收买；二、仍归社员私有，由社统一放养，原主按耕畜头数负担放养工；三、现在折价作为社员向社的投资，不行息，长大后由社里出卖或者留用，超过原来折价的部分由社和原主协商分益；四、组织常年积肥组。
    根据这些办法，全区各个农业合作社都结合生产规划，妥善地处理了社员剩余的幼畜和老弱耕畜。大河村和平农业合作社剩余了六十多头牲畜，采用私有伙喂的办法组织了两个牛群。别的一些社有的采用作价归社，有的组织了常年积肥组。这样剩余的幼畜和老弱耕畜都有了出路，社员们对这种处理办法都很满意。
