Observer's Commentary:

    Recently, King Abdulaziz Saud of Saudi Arabia paid a friendly visit to India and issued a joint statement with Indian Prime Minister Nehru on December 12. In their joint statement, they pointed out that the primary need at present is to promote world peace and ease international tensions. India and Saudi Arabia fully believe in the Five Principles, namely: mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, mutual respect for equality, and peaceful coexistence. They believe that only these principles can provide a stable basis for peaceful cooperation between countries in the world.

    This statement has been valued and welcomed by peace-loving people. It once again demonstrates the vitality of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, proving that these principles should and can be applied to general international relations. The more countries that adhere to these principles, the larger the peaceful region will be, and the more guaranteed world peace will be. Therefore, the joint statement of the leaders of India and Saudi Arabia not only promoted the development of friendly relations between the two countries, but also expanded the influence of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This is of great significance for maintaining peace in the Asian-African region.

    It is entirely understandable that Saudi Arabia has announced its adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It has, together with many Asian and African countries, actively participated in the Bandung Conference and strived to implement an independent and peaceful policy. Saudi Arabia resolutely safeguards its national sovereignty and national interests, opposes joining the military blocs established by Western countries in the Asian-African region, and advocates strengthening peaceful and friendly relations with Arab countries and countries around the world. Not long ago, Saudi Arabian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Faisal Saud pointed out: "We should strengthen relations with all countries." It is clear that adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is fully consistent with the implementation of an independent and peaceful policy and is a strong guarantee for maintaining independence and peace.

    Contrary to the wishes of the people of all countries, the activities of Western countries such as the United States and Britain run counter to the idea of ​​peaceful coexistence. They violate the territorial sovereignty of others everywhere, interfere in the internal affairs of others, and use the method of piecing together military blocs to promote war plans and colonial policies. In the Near and Middle East, the establishment of the aggressive Baghdad Pact by Western countries and the armed occupation of the Buraimi Oasis are prominent examples. The people of Asian and African countries have seen that their way out is definitely not to follow the policies of Western countries, but to unite and strive for peaceful coexistence between countries to safeguard the independence and peace of all countries. The former road is fundamentally impassable, while the latter road has broad prospects. As the King of Saudi Arabia recently pointed out in an interview with Indian journalists, "The Baghdad Pact cannot be a tool for maintaining peace," "Those foreigners behind this treaty will not be able to achieve their goals through this treaty, whatever their goals may be."

    The joint statement of the leaders of India and Saudi Arabia marks the continued development of friendly relations between Asian and African countries, and marks that the Asian-African situation is continuing to move forward in accordance with the wishes and demands of the people. No reactionary force can stop this huge trend.

### 印度和沙特阿拉伯友好关系的发展

    印度和沙特阿拉伯友好关系的发展
    最近，沙特阿拉伯国王阿齐兹·沙特到印度进行了友好访问，并在十二月十二日同印度总理尼赫鲁发表了联合声明。他们在联合声明中指出，目前首要的需要是促进世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势。印度和沙特阿拉伯两国充分信奉五项原则，即：互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、互相尊重和平等、和平共处。他们认为，只有这些原则才能为世界各国之间的和平合作提供稳定的基础。
    这个声明受到爱好和平人民的重视和欢迎。它再次显示了和平共处的五项原则的生命力，证明了这些原则完全应该并且可以应用于一般国际关系中。如果奉行这些原则的国家越多，那末和平的地区就会越大，世界和平就会越有保障。因此，印度和沙特阿拉伯两国领袖的联合声明，不仅促进了两国之间友好关系的发展，而且扩大了和平共处的五项原则的影响。这对于维护亚非地区的和平有着重要意义。
    沙特阿拉伯宣布信奉和平共处的五项原则，是完全可以理解的。它曾经和亚非许多国家一起，积极参加了万隆会议，并努力执行独立和和平的政策。沙特阿拉伯坚决维护自己国家主权和民族利益，反对参加西方国家在亚非地区所建立的军事集团，而主张加强同阿拉伯国家以及世界各国之间的和平友好关系。不久以前，沙特阿拉伯首相兼外交大臣费萨尔·沙特指出：“我们应该加强同一切国家的关系。”很显然，信奉和平共处的五项原则，是同执行独立和和平政策完全一致的，并且是维护独立和和平的有力保证。
    和各国人民的愿望相反，美国和英国等西方国家的活动，是和和平共处的思想背道而驰的。它们到处侵犯别人的领土主权，干涉别人的内政，并用拼凑军事集团的办法来推行战争计划和殖民政策。在中近东，西方国家建立侵略性的巴格达条约，武力侵占布赖米绿洲，就是显著的例子。亚非各国人民都看到，他们的出路绝对不是追随西方国家的政策，而是团结起来争取各国之间的和平共处，来维护各国的独立和和平。前一条道路是根本走不通的，后一条道路则是前途广阔的。正同沙特阿拉伯国王最近对印度记者谈话时所指出，“巴格达条约不可能是维护和平的工具”，“这个条约背后的那些外国将不能通过这种条约来达到它们的目的，不管它们的目的是什么。”
    印度和沙特阿拉伯两国领袖的联合声明，标志着亚非国家之间的友好关系的继续发展，标志着亚非局势正在按照人民的愿望和要求继续前进，任何反动力量都不能阻挡这个巨大的趋势。
