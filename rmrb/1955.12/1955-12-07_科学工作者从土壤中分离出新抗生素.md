Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Germplasm Preservation Committee, the Institute of Materia Medica, the Central Institute of Hygiene, and Fujian Normal University have isolated actinomycete strains with strong antibiotic effects from soil in China and have extracted more than ten pure antibiotics. These antibiotics inhibit many types of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus.

The work of isolating new antibiotic bacteria and new antibiotics from soil in China began in 1953. Over the past few years, scientists have isolated a total of more than 15,000 strains from more than 1,600 soil samples from Beijing, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Henan and other places, of which more than 4,000 strains have antibiotic effects. Several of the strains with the strongest antibiotic effects have been studied in more detail.

Scientists have not only isolated several new strains with very strong antibiotic effects and obtained pure antibiotics, but they have also gained a preliminary understanding of the distribution of antibiotic bacteria of various properties in different soils and their ecological characteristics, providing preliminary data for planned searches for new strains. Research has also been carried out on the culture media and isolation methods used for isolating actinomycetes. Microbiologists have also done a lot of work on the classification and identification of actinomycetes.

The work of isolating new antibiotic bacteria and new antibiotics is very important, as it can yield valuable new antibiotic bacteria and new antibiotics with better efficacy than existing antibiotics. This work is currently continuing.

    科学工作者从土壤中分离出新抗生素
    新华社六日讯　中国科学院菌种保藏委员会、药物研究所、中央卫生研究院和福建师范学院等单位的科学工作者从我国土壤中分离得到了一些有很强抗生作用的放线菌菌株，并且已经提炼出十多种纯粹的抗生物质。这些抗生物质分别对大肠杆菌、枯草杆菌、金色葡萄球菌等许多种病菌有抑制作用。
    从我国土壤中分离新抗生菌和分离新抗生素的工作是从一九五三年开始的。几年来，科学工作者从北京、浙江、江苏、福建、河南等地的一千六百多份土壤样品中一共分离得到一万五千多株菌种，其中有抗生作用的有四千多株。对其中几种抗生作用最强的菌种已经作较仔细的研究。
    科学工作者不但分离得到了几株抗生作用很强的新菌种，并且得到了纯粹的抗生物质，在工作中还初步了解了各种性质的抗生菌在不同土壤中的分布情况和它们的生态特性，为有计划地寻找新菌种提供了初步资料。对分离放线菌用的培养基和分离方法也进行了研究。在放线菌的分类和鉴定方面，微生物学家也进行了许多工作。
    分离新抗生菌和新抗生素的工作是十分重要的，可以从中得到有价值的新抗生菌和比现有抗生素有更好疗效的新抗生素。现在，这项工作正在继续进行。
