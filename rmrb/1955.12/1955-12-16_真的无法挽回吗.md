The affiliated enterprise engineering of the state-owned Wuhan Iron and Steel Company only completed 23% of its monthly plan in November. The steel and wood processing workshop project, originally planned to build walls, did not even complete the foundation. The horizontal trestle project, which was originally required to have the concrete poured, was still excavating the foundation soil as of December 8th. Some of the automobile base construction projects in the plan have not even started.

The leading staff of the Second Engineering Company and its subordinate Third Construction Site of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction Company, who were responsible for these projects, discovered this situation in the first half of November. However, they believed that the situation was irreversible and that no measures could salvage the overall situation, so they adopted a passive attitude of "accepting fate, leaving things to heaven." They did not actively find ways to solve the problem when 90% of the workers on the construction site failed to meet the state-stipulated labor quotas. When Soviet experts suggested using scrapers to replace excavators for shoveling soil, they did not implement it quickly. As a result, a project that was originally planned to be completed in eleven days took thirty-two days. On the construction site, on the one hand, rebar workers were sent to dig soil, and on the other hand, they were clamoring for a shortage of rebar workers.

As the saying goes, "Man proposes, God disposes." Many enterprises that were originally unable to complete state plans have been able to change the situation after taking effective measures. The leading staff of the affiliated enterprise engineering of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company are guilty of dereliction of duty by adopting an attitude of "accepting fate" towards completing state plans. Now is the time to immediately cheer up.

    真的无法挽回吗
    国营武汉钢铁公司的附属企业工程十一月份只完成了月计划的百分之二十三。原计划要砌墙的钢筋、木材两加工车间的工程，连基础也没有完成；原要求把混凝土浇灌完毕的水平栈桥工程，到十二月八日还在挖槽基土方；计划中施工的汽车基地的部分工程项目，根本还没有动工。
    负责这些工程的武汉钢铁建设公司第二工程公司和所属第三工地的领导工作人员，在十一月上半月就发现了这一情况。可是，他们却认为大势已去，任何措施也不能挽回大局，因而就采取了“听天由命，成事在天”的消极态度。工地上百分之九十的工人达不到国家规定的劳动定额，他们也不积极设法解决。苏联专家建议用铲运机来代替掘土机铲土，他们也没有很快执行，结果，原计划十一天完成的工程，却用去了三十二天。在工地上，一方面让钢筋工去挖土，而另一方面却叫喊缺少钢筋工。
    俗话说得好：“事在人为”。许多原来完不成国家计划的企业，采取了有效措施以后，都能改变情况。武汉钢铁公司附属企业工程的领导工作人员，对完成国家计划采取“听天由命”的态度，是放弃领导的失职行为。现在该是立即振作起来的时候了。
