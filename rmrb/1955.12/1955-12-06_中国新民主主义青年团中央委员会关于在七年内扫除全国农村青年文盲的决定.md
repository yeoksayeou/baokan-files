    I. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have instructed that eliminating the large number of illiterates left over from the old society and raising the cultural level of the people is a task of strategic significance. The current state of cultural backwardness among rural youth is incompatible with the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement. This serious problem must be resolved in the process of the cooperativization movement. Eliminating illiteracy and semi-literacy among about 70 percent of rural youth is an important aspect of realizing the great task of agricultural cooperativization and an important condition for implementing technological reforms and using large agricultural machines in rural areas in the future. Agricultural cooperativization has brought many favorable conditions for farmers to learn culture. Now, the broad masses of farmers, especially young farmers, have greatly increased their enthusiasm for learning culture, and getting rid of illiteracy has become their personal requirement. At the same time, there are now more than 30 million literate young people who can serve as a force for eliminating illiteracy; and after several years of literacy work, leaders at all levels have also accumulated some experience. The Youth League is the Party's assistant in eliminating illiteracy and bears a special and important responsibility for eliminating illiteracy. Youth League committees at all levels should make full use of all favorable conditions and actively take concrete measures to launch a mass movement for eliminating illiteracy in rural areas throughout the country, so that the literacy movement closely follows the development of the socialist transformation of agriculture.
    II. In order to adapt to the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, it is necessary to speed up the pace of literacy. Under the unified planning of the Party and the government for eliminating illiteracy, the Central Committee of the Youth League has decided to eliminate illiteracy among young people throughout the country within seven years, that is, before the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan. There are currently about 100 million rural youth in the country. After general education and several years of spare-time cultural education, 30 million people have gotten rid of illiteracy. At present, there are still 70 million young people who are illiterate and semi-literate. Based on the above situation and existing conditions, it is entirely possible to rely on more than 30 million literate young people to eliminate illiteracy among 70 million rural youth in the country during the first and second five-year plan periods, that is, before 1962. The entire league should strive to complete this great task.
    The specific progress of eliminating illiteracy among young people in the next seven years will be separately stipulated by the Central Committee of the Youth League.
    III. The work of eliminating illiteracy should firmly grasp the principle of serving agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production. In editing textbooks and teaching guides, attention should be paid to linking with reality. We must start by learning the common words most needed by farmers for recording work points, accounting, and writing notes, so as to achieve "learning for application"; we must provide flexible guidance according to the different agricultural seasons in various places, avoiding both coercion and letting things drift. We should implement a system of "opening school on time and taking holidays on time" according to the principle of "learning more when not busy, learning less when slightly busy, and taking a break when very busy." In this way, we can persist in learning throughout the year without hindering production. In terms of learning methods, we should correctly summarize and utilize the experience of rapid literacy methods. Where there are conditions for teaching phonetic alphabets, phonetic alphabets should be taught first to help literacy, help look up dictionaries, and help listen to Mandarin.
    IV. The literacy movement is the conscious action of millions of people under the leadership of the Party. In order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, Youth League committees at all levels should take the following measures:
    (1) According to the overall plan of the Party and the government for literacy work in the province, county (city), district, and township (village) and the specific requirements for this year (because the development of agricultural cooperativization movements varies from place to place, the specific conditions for literacy vary, and the progress of literacy will definitely be fast and slow. Some districts and townships may eliminate illiteracy in less than seven years or even two or three years, and some places may take longer than seven years to eliminate illiteracy), in close cooperation with the education administrative departments, refer to the overall indicators, start with investigation and research, and formulate a plan for eliminating illiteracy among young people in the region, based on the different actual situations in the area, and the specific measures required and the progress.
    (2) Youth League organizations should pay attention to using all effective forms of learning, such as people's schools, work-point study classes, literacy groups, contracted teaching and learning, etc., to carry out literacy, and should pay special attention to using the method of contracted teaching and learning to help busy rural cadres and women with children to study.
    (3) Youth League organizations must do the work of mobilizing and organizing the masses with the greatest effort, mobilize rural senior primary school and junior high school graduates, young people who have already escaped illiteracy, and primary school teachers to participate in the literacy movement, form a literacy army, and continuously expand the literacy team. At the same time, young people who are illiterate and semi-literate should be educated to establish a correct attitude towards learning, study diligently, and persist in learning throughout the year. Youth League branches should actively and carefully select part-time teachers, pay attention to strengthening the political and ideological leadership of part-time teachers, help them improve the quality of teaching, and solve various practical difficulties. The county committees of the Youth League should assist the education administrative departments in doing a good job in the training of part-time teachers every year.
    (4) In order to mobilize all literacy forces and promote the literacy experience of advanced units and advanced individuals, collective and individual rewards should be given in a timely manner to activists and advanced units in teaching, learning, and running schools. The Central Committee of the Youth League has decided to award medals and certificates of merit for eliminating illiteracy among young people, and will jointly convene a national conference of activists in eliminating illiteracy among rural youth with the Ministry of Education in September 1956. Youth League provincial and county committees should hold a conference of literacy activists every year from next year together with the education administrative departments. At the same time, the county and district committees of the Youth League should take the initiative to assist the local education administrative departments in establishing a system for holding regular examinations and issuing graduation certificates.
    V. During the period of the Third Five-Year Plan, rural reforms will be carried out simultaneously with social reforms and technological reforms. Social reforms will develop from semi-socialism to full socialism, and the use of large-scale agricultural machinery will increase year by year. According to this requirement, rural youth must not be satisfied with merely being literate. In order to continuously improve the cultural level of the masses and prevent the phenomenon of "relapse," the establishment of spare-time primary schools should be universally promoted, and self-study groups can be established where conditions are not yet available. Local newspapers and periodicals of the Youth League should be further popularized, provide tutoring for literacy learning, and publish learning materials. County and district committees of the Youth League should vigorously organize young people to read popular books and newspapers, establish voluntary rural postal stations, and conscientiously do a good job in the distribution and management of popular books and newspapers. Strive to establish a library in every township in most parts of the country within the next three years, relying on the strength of the masses, vigorously advocate blackboard newspapers and wall newspapers, carry out various cultural activities, and use listening to the radio to promote the learning of Mandarin.
    VI. As early as six years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out to us: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." Now, the time for a major advance in culture has come. In order to build a socialist motherland, in order to meet the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, and in order to improve the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of working people and eliminate the cultural backwardness left over from the old society, Youth League organizations throughout the country must overcome all possible difficulties encountered in literacy work with the greatest enthusiasm and tenacious spirit, and become the Party's most active assistant in literacy work. In particular, Youth League committees that lead Youth League work in rural areas should earnestly strengthen their leadership over literacy work and seriously discuss this decision. Youth League provincial and county committees should specifically grasp the literacy work of one county, one district, and one village in order to gain experience, strengthen guidance, and assist the Party and the government in completing and completing ahead of schedule the historical task of eliminating rural illiteracy.

    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会关于在七年内扫除全国农村青年文盲的决定
    一、党中央和毛主席指示，扫除旧社会遗留下来的大量文盲，提高人民的文化水平，是具有战略意义的任务。目前农村青年文化上的落后状态和农业合作化运动的开展是不相适应的。这一严重的问题，必须在合作化运动的过程中加以解决。扫除占农村青年百分之七十左右的文盲、半文盲，是实现农业合作化伟大任务的一个重要方面，也是今后农村实行技术改革、使用大型农业机器的重要条件。农业合作化给农民学习文化带来了许多有利条件。现在广大农民，特别是青年农民，学习文化的积极性大大提高，摆脱文盲状态成了他们的切身要求。同时，现在已有三千多万识字青年可以作为扫盲的力量；而且经过几年来的扫盲工作，各级领导也积累了一些经验。青年团是党在扫除文盲工作中的助手，对扫除文盲负有特殊重大的责任。各级团委应当充分运用一切有利条件，积极采取具体措施，在全国农村中掀起一个群众性的扫盲热潮，使扫盲运动紧紧跟上农业的社会主义改造的开展。
    二、为着适应农业合作化运动的发展，必须加快扫盲速度。在党和政府扫除文盲的统一规划下，团中央决定在七年之内，也就是在第二个五年计划完成前扫除全国青年文盲。现在全国农村青年约有一亿，经过普通教育和几年来的业余文化教育，已有三千万人摆脱了文盲状态。目前还有七千万青年是文盲和半文盲。根据上述情况和现有条件，在第一、二个五年计划时期内，即在一九六二年前依靠三千多万识字青年去扫除全国七千万的农村青年文盲是完全可能的，全团应当为完成这一伟大任务而努力。
    今后七年内扫除青年文盲的具体进度，由团中央另行规定。
    三、扫除文盲的工作应当紧紧掌握为农业合作化和农业生产服务的原则。编辑课本和教学指导，都要注意联系实际。要从农民记工、算账、写便条所最需要的常用字学起，做到“学以致用”；要按照各地农事季节的不同，灵活指导，既要避免强迫命令，又不要放任自流，应当根据“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙放学”的原则，实行“定期开学，按时放假”的制度。这样就可以坚持常年学习，不致妨碍生产。在学习的方法上，应当正确地总结和利用速成识字法的经验，凡是有条件教学注音字母的地方，首先教学注音字母，以便帮助识字，帮助查字典，帮助听普通话。
    四、扫盲运动是在党领导下的千百万群众的自觉行动。为了充分发挥群众的积极性，各级团委应当采取如下措施：
    （一）根据党和政府对本省、本县（市）、本区、本乡（村）的扫盲工作的全面规划和本年度的具体要求（由于各地农业合作化运动的发展快慢不同，扫盲的具体条件不同，扫盲的进度也一定会有快有慢，有的区乡不要七年甚至两三年内就可以扫除，有的地方可能还要比七年更多一点的时间才能扫除），同教育行政部门密切合作，参照总的指标，从调查研究着手，按照当地实际情况的不同，订出本地区扫除青年中的文盲的计划进度、要求和具体措施。
    （二）团的组织应当注意运用一切有效的学习形式，如民校、记工学习班、识字小组、包教保学等进行扫盲，特别应当注意运用包教保学的方法，帮助工作繁忙的乡村干部和有子女的妇女进行学习。
    （三）团的组织要以最大的力量做好动员和组织群众的工作，动员农村高小、初中毕业生、已经脱离文盲状态的青年和小学教师参加扫盲运动，组成扫盲大军，并且不断地扩大扫盲队伍。同时，要教育处于文盲和半文盲状态的青年，树立正确的学习态度，勤学苦练，坚持常年学习。团的支部应当积极地、慎重地挑选业余教师，注意加强业余教师的政治思想领导，帮助他们提高教学质量和解决各种实际困难。团的县委要协助教育行政部门做好每年的业余教师的训练工作。
    （四）为了动员一切扫盲力量和推广先进单位、先进人物的扫盲经验，要及时给予教学上、学习上、办学上的积极分子和先进单位以集体的和个人的奖励。团中央决定颁发青年扫除文盲的奖章和奖状，并且在一九五六年九月和教育部共同召开全国农村青年扫除文盲积极分子大会。团省、县委从明年起每年应当和教育行政部门一起举行一次扫盲积极分子大会。同时，团的县委和区委应当主动协助当地教育行政部门建立定期举行考试和发毕业证书的制度。
    五、在第三个五年计划时期内，农村的改革将是社会改革和技术改革同时并进，社会改革将由半社会主义发展到全社会主义，大型农业机器的使用将逐年增多。根据这一要求，农村青年决不能仅仅以识字为满足。为了不断提高群众的文化水平和防止“回生”现象，应当普遍提倡开办业余小学，暂时没有条件办的可以成立自学小组。团的地方报刊应当进一步通俗化，辅导扫盲学习，刊登学习材料。县、区团委应当大力组织青年群众阅读通俗书报，建立义务乡邮站，切实做好通俗书报的发行和管理工作。争取在今后三年内，依靠群众自己的力量，在全国大部分地区，每乡建立起一个图书室，大力倡办黑板报、墙报，开展各种文化活动；并且利用听广播来提倡学习普通话。
    六、毛主席早在六年前就向我们指出过：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”现在，向文化大进军的时机已经来到了。为了建设社会主义的祖国，为了迎接农业合作化的高潮，也为了改善广大劳动群众的物质和文化生活，消灭旧社会遗留下来的文化落后现象，全国团的组织必须以最大的热情和顽强的精神，去克服扫盲工作上可能遇到的一切困难，成为党在扫除文盲工作上最积极的助手。特别是领导农村团的工作的团委更应当切实加强自己对扫盲工作的领导，认真讨论这一决定。团的省委、县委都应该具体掌握一县、一区、一村的扫盲工作，以便取得经验，加强指导，协助党和政府完成和提前完成扫除农村文盲的历史任务。
