Why There's a Shortage of Work

    The Changchun Automobile Repair Factory has been facing a shortage of work for a long time, and this situation is becoming increasingly serious. From July to now this year, an average of over forty out of the factory's two hundred plus workers have no work to do each day; those who have work also experience intermittent periods of activity and idleness. From January to October, the factory only completed 47% of its annual state plan.

    This situation is self-inflicted by the Changchun Automobile Repair Factory. The factory's repair quality is poor, with almost 100% of the cars repaired in September and October requiring rework. Delays in repairs are also a serious problem. A car belonging to the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was under repair at the factory for more than five months. It took over twenty trips to pick up the car, and the gasoline used for picking up and test-driving alone amounted to more than 300 catties (approximately 150 kilograms). Due to the small amount of work and in order to subsidize expenses such as equipment depreciation and production management fees, the factory overestimates labor and materials, setting the repair prices very high.

    As a result, the Changchun Automobile Repair Factory has less and less work. The twenty-four units that used to frequently bring their cars for repair no longer do so.

    The Changchun Automobile Repair Factory must immediately change its management style and improve its management level.

### 为什么缺活干

    为什么缺活干
    长春市汽车修配厂长期以来一直缺活干，而且这种情况越来越严重。今年七月到现在，全厂两百多人平均每天有四十多人没活干；有活干的人也是时干时停。这个厂一至十月份仅完成全年国家计划百分之四十七。
    这种情况是长春市汽车修配厂自己造成的。这个厂修车质量低劣，九、十两个月修的车几乎百分之百都进行了返修。修车拖期的现象也很严重。中共吉林省委的一辆汽车，在该厂修理了五个多月，取车去了二十多次，仅取车和试车用去的汽油就达三百多斤。活少，为了补助设备折旧费、生产管理费等开支，该厂便高估工料，把修车价钱订得很高。
    这样，长春市汽车修配厂的活便越来越少。过去常来修车的二十四个单位现在都不来了。
    长春市汽车修配厂必须立即改变经营作风，提高管理水平。
