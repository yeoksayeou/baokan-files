Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS, Rangoon, December 7th: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Khrushchev, visited the University of Rangoon on the morning of the 6th and were warmly welcomed by professors, teachers, and students.

Khrushchev addressed those who welcomed them.

Khrushchev's speech is as follows:

	Our dear young friends, students of Burma, esteemed teachers and professors!

	Allow me, on my own behalf and on behalf of my friend Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin and the entire Soviet people, to extend greetings and best wishes to you.

	We are very happy to be able to meet with you. When we arrived at your university, we thought that this is one of the striking results of the Burmese people gaining the independence of their motherland. The doors of higher education have been opened, and the youth of Asia are entering these schools to master the knowledge necessary for the successful construction of a new life. (Applause)

	For many years, the colonialists told the people they enslaved that they should be grateful to the colonialists for being entrenched in Asian countries. The colonialists insisted that they brought culture to the enslaved countries and taught the people of these countries how to live.

	But now, although the colonialists have not disappeared everywhere, their era is gone forever. The people of Asian countries have resolutely risen up to build a life according to their wishes.

	After gaining national political independence, you should now strive to further consolidate your achievements. To achieve true and substantial freedom, you should establish an economy in the liberated country that does not depend on foreign countries.

	When imperialist countries have to give in to the people who rise up in resistance, they are very good at changing their course according to the wind. While withdrawing their armed forces from some countries, they are also trying to make these countries more subordinate to them and make these countries more economically dependent on the breath of monopoly capitalists. Anyone who hopes for the independence of their motherland cannot tolerate this kind of thing. (Stormy applause)

	We have talked about this more than once when meeting with the residents of India and Burma. Some Europeans do not like to hear these words of ours. (Lively atmosphere in the hall, applause) But not all Europeans support colonial rule. Our country is both a European country and an Asian country, because part of the territory of the Soviet Union is in Europe, and another part is in Asia. The Soviet Union does not support the policies of the colonialists and firmly opposes them. (Prolonged applause)

	Some Europeans who are accustomed to living by exploiting the blood and sweat of the enslaved people of Asia and Africa are now trembling because they have felt the strength and power of the people of Asia and Africa who have risen up to fight for their independence. (Stormy and prolonged applause) And we Soviets are happy that the people are overthrowing the colonial system and embarking on the road of independent development. (Prolonged applause)

	I often have the opportunity to talk to some foreigners. Just recently, I had a conversation with a bourgeois person, who tried hard to give me such "well-intentioned" advice.

	He said that the Soviet Union has given China tremendous help. Are you doing the right thing? You know, your population is two hundred million, while China has six hundred million. Isn't this a danger to your country? Once China establishes its own industry and strengthens its independent nation, it will threaten the Soviet Union. This "kind-hearted person" also said, you have to think about whether it is worth doing this. A strong China will not only threaten the Soviet Union, but also threaten other European countries, and will stifle them.

	We Soviets understand why such advice is given to us. This advice does not come from good intentions. This advice comes from a bourgeois point of view, from the principle of "man is an enemy to man." In the capitalist world, there is such a law: if you do not oppress others, others will oppress you. If it is a weak country, it must be placed in a vassal position. We firmly oppose this kind of argument. (Prolonged applause)

	Our theory is different. We say that people are brothers and friends. We say that people are talented creatures. We say that one person should not oppress another, and one country should not enslave another. If a person is liberated from economic enslavement and masters science, then he can conquer the forces of nature, and this force will serve mankind. (Prolonged applause)

	We say that if the wealth created by people can be distributed correctly, and if there is no phenomenon of people exploiting people, then the wealth created by people's labor is enough to supply the needs of all people on earth. (Stormy applause) Then a harmonious society will be built all over the world. All people, regardless of skin color, will be brothers. (Applause) Hostility between countries will be eliminated, and there will be no more wars. (Prolonged applause) All economic means will be used to create happiness and prosperity for the people. (Applause)

	Dear friends, everyone can think about how much progress science will be able to make!

	We visited your university. We believe that you and your university are the first sprouts that have emerged on land that has been freed from the status of a colonial dependency. (Stormy applause)

	Some people told us that there are a total of nine thousand university students in Rangoon. This can be said to be many, or it can be said to be few. It can be said to be many because you did not have a sufficient number of secondary schools in the past. You also do not have school buildings and laboratories to supply a large number of university students, and there is not a necessary number of professors and teachers. Considering all of this, then you have many university students.

	However, if you pay attention to the needs of the country and the people's desire for knowledge, then you have too few university students.

	However, good things usually start from small things, and then constantly grow and develop.

	When the people of our country gained independence and began to build a new life, our university students were also very few. The Soviet regime widely opened the doors of higher education to young workers and peasants. Our government once specially established some workers' specialized schools so that workers could obtain secondary and then higher education, so that our people's intellectuals could grow up rapidly.

	Let me talk about myself.

	When the war ended and we drove all the enemies out of our own land, I, a former miner, entered a workers' specialized school to study. I was not as young as you are sitting in front of me at the time. I was already twenty-seven years old. We studied diligently and strived to master science. Because the great Lenin called on us to do so at that time. At that time, the government did everything possible to make it possible for us to study well. We studied for free. In addition, we could also receive scholarships, just like the current situation of university students in our country receiving scholarships.

	Our people's intellectuals who came from the people, honest and loyal intellectuals who serve their own people, were cultivated and raised in this way.

	And now, the situation of our national education is like this: in the Soviet Union, there are as many as tens of millions of people studying. There are far more than one million students studying in our institutions of higher education alone.

	We are doing everything possible to ensure that all young people in cities and villages receive secondary education and that as many young people as possible have the opportunity to receive higher education.

	In a short period of time, in the thirty-eight years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, our country has changed from a backward Russia to a country where illiteracy has disappeared. More engineers, agronomists, and other experts graduate from Soviet universities every year than in the United States. (Applause)

	This is the government of workers and peasants. (Prolonged applause) The Soviet regime believes that caring for the happiness and prosperity of all ethnic groups is the most important thing. (Stormy applause)

	I hope that what I said can be understood correctly. I said all these things not for propaganda, I am just citing some facts.

	After the workers and peasants of the Soviet Union seized power, under the leadership of the great Lenin and the Communist Party he founded, they built a socialist country, the existence of which is a challenge to the entire capitalist world. (Stormy applause) The workers and peasants of the Soviet Union have proved that our Soviet system is the most progressive system. The socialism that has been built in the Soviet Union is the best society and the greatest achievement of mankind. (Stormy applause)

	I am often told that I like to advocate that socialism will surely triumph and will surely defeat capitalism.

	Yes, I fully believe in this. All of us Soviets believe that the socialist system will surely triumph in the peaceful competition between the two systems. As long as our hearts are still beating, we will never give up our doctrine, because it is a correct and progressive doctrine.

	The days of the capitalist system are numbered. (Prolonged applause) Metabolism is constantly taking place in the organism of living things. Old cells die at any time, and new cells are constantly produced. The same is true in society. The old system is dying, and a new, more progressive, and more advanced system is being born. (Prolonged applause) The socialist system and communist society are this new system, and our people are victoriously moving towards communist society. (Applause) We are moving towards communism without war. We do not need war, because war harms our cause. (Prolonged applause) It is impossible to stop the development of ideas by force, nor is it possible to spread ideas by force.

	We advocate that people should establish the kind of political system that they think is appropriate.

	The Soviet people, who have built a socialist society, firmly believe that the socialist system will surely defeat the dying capitalist system. And we Soviets are happily working to achieve this goal, because it is a noble task.

	Our young friends! Professors and teachers! We wish you success in mastering and developing science. When learning serves the people and serves one's own country, it is beneficial to the people and the country. Therefore, intellectuals should have an inseparable connection with the people. The people will respect you more. With the support of the people, your science will flourish like a hundred flowers blooming.

	Please forgive me, maybe I said some things that you didn't want to hear. But, like my friend Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin, I have the most sincere hopes for you, and we wish you all the best. This is not only our hope. The Soviet people are also ready to introduce their experience and knowledge to you. (Prolonged applause) The more extensive the exchange of scientific knowledge, the more extensive the cultural ties, the more widely we exchange engineering and technical experience with each other, the better and more friendly the people of our two countries will get along. We sincerely want to promote your economic development and introduce you to the knowledge and experience we have accumulated.

	We welcome your professors, engineers, and students to come to the Soviet Union more often. (Prolonged applause) We will receive them like friends. We want to let you see with your own eyes what the Soviet people have achieved, how our intellectuals live and work, and how our students live and master knowledge. People want to not only hear, but also see what they hear. They want to touch what these things are made of. (Lively atmosphere in the hall) Please come to us, see our people, and touch what we have accomplished. You like what you like, and you don't like what you don't like, we don't force it. This is also peaceful coexistence. Everyone lives in the way he likes, and at the same time does not force others to accept anything.

	We cooperate very well with your country and your government in the struggle for peace. Let us strengthen our ties in this area, let us more actively strive for world peace.

	Long live the young students of Burma! Long live the young Burmese intellectuals who are accumulating knowledge and experience for the development of their country and for the benefit of the people! Long live the female students! There are still very few of them among you, and we hope that there will be more and more of them. Women occupy an important position in society. They actively participate in social life and educate the next generation to a large extent. (Applause) If they get more help in learning today, then tomorrow this knowledge will be passed on more to children – the new generation. (Prolonged applause)

	Long live the professors and teachers of the University of Rangoon who spare no effort to dedicate their knowledge to the people through you university students! (Prolonged applause)

	Long live the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Burma! (Prolonged applause) Long live world peace! (Stormy and prolonged applause, everyone stood up and warmly cheered for Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Bulganin.)

### 赫鲁晓夫在仰光大学的讲话

    赫鲁晓夫在仰光大学的讲话
    新华社据塔斯社仰光七日电　苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫在六日上午访问了仰光大学，受到了教授、教员和学生们的热烈欢迎。
    赫鲁晓夫对欢迎他们的人讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫的讲话如下：
    我们亲爱的青年朋友们、缅甸的大学生们，各位教员和教授们！
    请允许我以我个人的名义，并且代表我的朋友尼古拉·亚历山德罗维奇·布尔加宁和全体苏联人民向你们致意，并且表示最好的愿望。
    我们很高兴能够同你们见面。我们一到你们这个大学的时候就想到，这就是缅甸人民获得了祖国独立的鲜明的结果之一。高等学府的大门敞开了，亚洲的青年进入了这些学校去掌握为成功地建设新生活所必需的知识。（掌声）
    多少年来，殖民者对他们所奴役的人民说，被奴役的人民应当感谢殖民者在亚洲国家中盘踞着。殖民者硬说，他们给被奴役的国家带来文化，教给这些国家的人民应当如何生活。
    但是现在，殖民者尽管还没有到处绝迹，他们的时代已经一去不复返了。亚洲各国人民已经坚定地起来按照他们的愿望去建设生活。
    你们在获得国家的政治独立以后，现在应该尽力进一步巩固自己的成果。为了获得真正的实实在在的自由，应该在解放了的国家中建立起不依赖外国的经济。
    当帝国主义国家不得不向起来反抗的人民让步的时候，它们是极善于看风转舵的。它们一面从一些国家撤退它们的武装部队，但是一面又力图使这些国家更加从属于它们，使这些国家在经济上更加仰赖垄断资本家的鼻息。凡是希望祖国独立的人，都不能够容忍这种事情。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们同印度和缅甸居民会见的时候不止一次谈过这一点。我们的这些话是某些欧洲人所不喜欢听的。（场内活跃，掌声）但是并不是所有欧洲人都拥护殖民者的统治。我们的国家既是欧洲国家，又是亚洲国家，因为苏联的一部分领土是在欧洲，而另一部分领土是在亚洲。苏联不支持殖民者的政策，并且坚决反对它。（经久不息的掌声）
    某些惯于靠榨取被奴役的亚非国家人民的血汗来生活的欧洲人现在正在发抖，因为他们已感觉到起来为自己的独立而奋斗的亚非国家人民的力量和威力。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）而我们苏联人高兴的是，人民正在推翻殖民制度和走上独立发展的道路。（经久不息的掌声）
    我常常有机会同一些外国人谈话。就在不久以前我同一个资产阶级人士谈了一次话，他竭力向我提出这样的“善意”忠告。
    他说，苏联对中国作了巨大的帮助。你们这样做对吗？要知道，你们的人口是两亿，而中国有六亿。这对你们国家不是个危险吗？一旦中国建立起自己的工业，加强了自己的独立的国家，它就会威胁苏联。这位“好心肠的人”还说，你们要想想，值得不值得这样做。强盛的中国将会不仅威胁苏联，而且威胁其他欧洲国家，将会扼死它们。
    我们苏联人明白为什么向我们提出这种忠告。这种忠告不是出于善意。这种忠告是从资产阶级的观点出发的，是从“人对人是仇敌”的原则出发的。在资本主义世界有这样一条法则：如果你不压迫别人，别人就要压迫你。如果是一个衰弱国家，就要使它处在附庸地位。我们坚决反对这种论调。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们的理论却不同。我们说，人和人是兄弟和朋友。我们说，人是有才能的生物。我们说，一个人不应当压迫别人，一个国家不应当奴役别的国家。如果一个人从经济奴役下解放出来，并且掌握了科学，那末他就可以征服自然力量，而这种力量就会为人类服务。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们说，如果人所创造的财富能得到正确的分配，如果没有人剥削人的现象，那末人的劳动所创造的财富是足够供给地球上所有的人的需要的。（暴风雨般的掌声）那时在全世界就将建起一个和睦的社会。所有的人不分肤色都将是兄弟。（掌声）国家之间的敌视将会消除，将不再有战争。（经久不息的掌声）所有的经济手段都将用来为人民创造幸福和繁荣。（掌声）
    亲爱的朋友们，大家可以想一想，科学将可以取得多么大的进步！
    我们参观了你们的大学。我们认为你们和你们的大学是摆脱了殖民地附属国地位的土地上显露出来的第一批萌芽。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    有人对我们说，仰光共有九千名大学生。这可以说是多，也可以说是少。可以说是多，是因为你们过去没有足够数量的中等学校。你们也没有供应大量大学生用的校舍和实验室，没有必要数量的教授和教员。如果考虑到这一切，那末你们的大学生算是多的。
    但是，如果注意一下国家的需要和人民对于知识的渴望，那末你们的大学生还嫌少。
    然而，好事通常是从少开始，随后再不断成长和发展。
    当我们国家的人民获得了独立，开始建设新生活的时候，我们的大学生也是非常少的。苏维埃政权为工农青年广泛地打开了高等学校的大门。我们的政府曾经专门设立了一些工人专科学校，使工人们能够获得中等、随后是高等教育，使我们的人民知识分子迅速地成长起来。
    我谈谈我自己。
    当战争结束，我们把所有的敌人从自己的国土上赶走的时候，我这个过去的矿工就进入工人专科学校学习。我当时不像坐在我面前的各位那样年轻。我已经有二十七岁了。我们勤奋地学习，努力掌握科学。因为伟大的列宁当时号召我们要这样做。那时政府竭尽一切力量，以使我们有可能很好地学习。我们读书是免费的。此外，我们还可以领到助学金，就像目前我国大学生领助学金的情况一样。
    我们来自人民的人民知识分子、诚实和忠诚地为自己人民服务的知识分子，就是这样地成长和培养起来的。
    而现在，我们的国民教育的情况是这样：在苏联足足有几千万人在学习。仅仅在我们的高等学校中学习的就有远超过一百万的学生。
    我们在尽一切努力使城市和乡村的所有青年都受到中等教育，使尽可能多的青年有机会受到高等教育。
    在短短的时期内，在苏维埃政权建立以来的三十八年中，我们的国家已经从落后的俄国变成一个文盲绝迹的国家。每年从苏联高等学校毕业的工程师、农艺师和其他专家比美国多得多。（掌声）
    这就是工农政权。（经久不息的掌声）苏维埃政权认为关心各族人民的幸福和繁荣是最重要的事情。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我希望，我所说的话能得到正确的理解。我说所有这些话并不是为了宣传，我只是举出一些事实。
    苏联的工人和农民掌握了政权以后，在伟大的列宁和他缔造的共产党的领导之下，建成了社会主义国家，这个国家的存在是对整个资本主义世界的一个挑战。（暴风雨般的掌声）苏联的工人和农民已经证明，我们的苏维埃制度是最进步的制度。在苏联已经建成的社会主义是最好的社会，是人类的最伟大的成就。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    常常有人对我说，我很喜欢鼓吹社会主义一定胜利，一定战胜资本主义。
    不错，我完全相信这一点。我们苏联人全都相信，在两种制度的和平竞赛中社会主义制度必定胜利。只要我们的心还在跳动，我们决不放弃自己的学说，因为这是一种正确的、进步的学说。
    资本主义制度的日子屈指可数。（经久不息的掌声）生物的机体中在不断地进行新陈代谢，老的细胞随时死亡，新的细胞不断产生，在社会中也是一样，老的制度在死亡，新的、更进步的、更先进的制度在诞生。（经久不息的掌声）社会主义制度和共产主义社会就是这种新制度，我国人民正在胜利地走向共产主义社会。（掌声）我们正在不通过战争走向共产主义。我们不需要战争，因为战争危害我们的事业。（经久不息的掌声）既不可能用武力来阻挡思想的发展，也不可能用武力来传播思想。
    我们主张，人民应当建立他们认为合适的那种政治制度。
    建成了社会主义社会的苏联人民坚信，社会主义制度必定战胜垂死的资本主义制度。而我们苏联人在为达到这个目的而愉快地劳动，因为这是崇高的任务。
    我们的青年朋友们！教授和教员们！我们祝你们在掌握和发展科学方面获得成功。当学问为人民，为自己的国家服务的时候，它就有利于人民和国家。因此，知识分子应该同人民有不可分割的联系。人民将会更加尊敬你们。在人民的支持下，你们的科学将会像百花齐放一样地繁荣起来。
    请原谅我，可能我说了一些并不是你们想听的话。但是，我同我的朋友尼古拉·亚历山德罗维奇·布尔加宁一样，对你们怀着最恳切的希望，我们祝你们一切顺利。这不仅是我们的希望。苏联人民还准备把自己的经验、自己的知识介绍给你们。（经久不息的掌声）交流科学知识越是广泛，文化联系越是广泛，我们越是广泛地互相交流工程技术经验，我们两国人民就会更好地、更友善地相处。我们诚意地愿意促进你们的经济发展，把我们所积累的知识和经验介绍给你们。
    欢迎你们的教授、工程师和学生能更多地、时常地来苏联。（经久不息的掌声）我们将像朋友一样的接待他们。我们要让你们亲眼看一下，苏联人民有了什么收获，我们的知识分子是怎样生活和工作的，我们的学生是怎样生活和掌握知识的。人们不仅想听听，而且还想看看他们所听到的东西。他们想摸摸这些东西是用什么做成的。（场中活跃）请到我们那里，看看我们的人民，摸一摸我们完成的东西。你们喜欢的东西，就请接受，你们不喜欢的东西，就不接受，我们是不勉强的。这也就是和平共处。每个人按照他所喜欢的方式生活，同时不强迫其他人接受任何东西。
    我们同你们的国家、你们的政府在争取和平的斗争中合作得很好。让我们加强我们在这一方面的联系，让我们更加积极地争取世界和平。
    缅甸青年学生万岁！为了自己国家的发展、为了人民的利益而积累知识和经验的年轻的缅甸知识分子万岁！女大学生万岁！她们在你们当中还很少，我们希望她们越来越多。妇女在社会中占有重要的地位。她们积极参加社会生活，并且在很大的程度上教养着下一代。（掌声）如果她们今天在学习方面得到更多的帮助，那末明天这些知识将会更多地传给儿童——新生的一代。（经久不息的掌声）
    不吝惜力量把自己的知识通过你们大学生献给人民的仰光大学的教授和教员万岁！（经久不息的掌声）
    苏联和缅甸两国人民的友谊万岁！（经久不息的掌声）世界和平万岁！（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声，全体起立向赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志热烈欢呼。）
