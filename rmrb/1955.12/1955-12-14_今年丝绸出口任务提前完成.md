    This Year's Silk Export Task Completed Ahead of Schedule

    The China Silk Company overfulfilled its 1955 silk export task ahead of schedule at the end of November. Among them, the delivery to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries completed 101% of the annual plan, and the export to capitalist countries completed 110% of the annual plan. The export figures for eleven months increased by 12.8% compared with the export figures for the whole of last year. The foreign exchange earned for the country can be exchanged for a complete set of equipment for seven seamless steel pipe plants, or 11,420 tractors.

    The reasons for achieving the above results are, first of all, the party and government departments at all levels have implemented the policy of vigorously developing silkworm production, coupled with the strong cooperation and support of the agricultural and industrial departments, providing sufficient export sources. The victory of our country's peaceful diplomatic policy has created favorable conditions for expanding trade. Secondly, all employees of the China Silk Company enthusiastically responded to the Central Committee's call to increase production and practice economy, carried out socialist labor emulation drives, actively organized sources of goods, and implemented the policy of domestic sales serving foreign sales, thereby ensuring smooth delivery and advance exports. Now, the employees of various silk factories are working hard to strive for a greater overfulfillment of the task. (Yuan Yaofeng)

    今年丝绸出口任务提前完成
    中国丝绸公司于十一月底，提前超额完成一九五五年丝绸出口任务。其中对苏联和人民民主国家交货，完成全年计划百分之一百零一，对资本主义国家出口完成全年计划百分之一百一十，十一个月的出口数字比去年全年出口数字增加百分之十二点八。给国家增加的外汇，可以换回七个无缝钢管厂的全套设备，或者一万一千四百二十台拖拉机。
    取得以上成绩的原因，首先是各地党和政府部门贯彻执行了大力发展蚕丝生产的方针，加以农业、工业部门的有力配合和支持，提供了充足的出口货源。我国和平外交政策的胜利，创造了扩大贸易的有利条件。其次是中国丝绸公司的全体职工，热烈响应中央增产节约的号召，开展社会主义劳动竞赛，积极组织货源，贯彻执行内销服从外销的方针，从而保证了顺利交货，提前出口。现在，各丝绸厂职工正为争取更大的超额完成任务而努力。（袁耀峰）
