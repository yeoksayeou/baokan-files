    Improve Quality, Increase Speed, Ensure Completion of This Year's Plan, Properly Arrange Next Year's Work
    Li Yunchang, Vice Minister of Transportation

    The year 1955 is about to end in an instant, and new tasks are already before us. Striving to complete this year's plan and properly arranging next year's production and capital construction work are the top priorities at present.

    In the past ten months or so, river and sea transport has done a great deal of work. Based on the actual production figures for ten months and the estimated figures for two months, the volume of river and sea freight can reach 103% of the annual plan, the volume of freight turnover can reach 101%, and the throughput of the six coastal seaports can reach 96%. With a little more effort, the port enterprises can also complete the plan. At present, the Heilongjiang Shipping Bureau has overfulfilled the annual plan and has done a good job of winterizing the ships before the river freezes, and then carried out experiments on ice sledge transportation. In addition to striving to implement the annual plan, various river and sea transport enterprises have also undertaken huge temporary emergency transportation tasks and achieved certain results.

    Then, are we satisfied with the completion of this year's annual plan? No. In order to bring the production indicators up to the level required by the Five-Year Plan, more arduous efforts must be made. It should be seen that there are many shortcomings and problems in river and sea transport work. It is true that some difficulties have been encountered in river and sea transport operations this year, such as changes in the flow direction of some sources of goods in some routes. These changes in objective circumstances have indeed caused some difficulties for the enterprises in implementing the plan. However, these objective factors are not the main aspects of the problem. The main problem is that our transport organization work is poor. It should be pointed out that the organization of the upstream cargo from east to west on the Yangtze River route and the organization of cargo from Shanghai to the north along the coast in the past are not satisfactory. In the first half of the year, the seven river and sea port enterprises along the Yangtze River from Hankou downstream did not understand the distribution of cargo sources in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the organization of cargo sources from January to May only reached 76% of the plan, which resulted in a large number of return barges carrying insufficient cargo and some ships sailing empty or being out of service. The scheduling of ships and port cargo handling is also unsatisfactory. In the first half of the year, two-thirds of the ships on the Yangtze River were not included in the operating schedule, and the quality of the operation plan was very low. The density of ships arriving and departing at major ports was extremely uneven, resulting in cargo accumulation and slow transportation. The efficiency of cargo loading and unloading at ports is still behind schedule. The efficiency of work teams in major coastal ports such as Dalian and Shanghai in the third quarter decreased by 6% compared with the second quarter, and the loading and unloading efficiency of major Yangtze River ports in the third quarter decreased by 2% compared with the second quarter. This has resulted in a decrease in ship turnaround efficiency and an extension of non-productive berthing time. In the third quarter, the six non-productive berthing times of the Yangtze River and the major ports along the coast north of the Yangtze River Estuary added up to the equivalent of 34,000 tons of ships not sailing for the entire quarter, and the waste of transport capacity was extremely alarming. As for the low quality of transportation, it is a serious problem in our water transport work. At the beginning of the year, the sinking of the Yangtze River Yiyuan Wheel caused unnecessary deaths. Although the Shanghai Minzhu No. 3 Wheel ran aground off the coast of eastern Zhejiang, no one was killed thanks to effective rescue efforts, but the loss of state property was huge. In the first half of the year, errors and damage in cargo transportation were still very serious. Some of the grain shipped down from the southwest was moldy and rotten, and some of the tung oil deteriorated. This damaged state materials, delayed supply, increased compensation costs, increased transportation costs, and damaged the reputation of water transportation. In addition, the water transport freight rates were originally high, which resulted in an increase in unreasonable transportation. Some materials that should have been transported by water from Shanghai to the southwest were now changing their transportation routes, detouring through the Baocheng Railway and then by road to Chengdu. All of this shows that the level of operation and management of water transport is still backward, and it has not been able to give full play to the advantages of water transport in terms of large transport volume and low freight rates to better serve the national economy. Those views and ideas that unilaterally complain that the consigning departments do not provide freight or that the state's planning requirements are too high are all wrong. We must catch up and improve the operation and management level, production quality and production efficiency of shipping enterprises.

    There is less than a month left this year. This period of time is a very valuable time for transport production. All river and sea transport enterprises should actively do a good job in organizing cargo sources under the principle of rational transport, and should especially ensure that return barges get more cargo. The entire Yangtze River should strengthen ship scheduling and port cargo handling to ensure that goods shipped down the Sichuan River run directly as much as possible, and greatly reduce cargo transshipment. All shipping and port enterprises should conscientiously take safety measures for winter navigation and cargo handling to ensure the safety of passenger transport. The responsible personnel of each enterprise should personally board ships and go to the loading and unloading site to inspect various safety facilities. It is necessary to strictly implement technical operating procedures, pay attention to cargo stacking, packaging and marking, strengthen on-site operation inspections, and resolutely eliminate cargo damage and errors, with improving transportation quality as the central link, and strive to make all other management measures catch up in an all-round way.

    The basic construction projects this year, the two highways from Lhasa to Xigaze and from Xigaze to Gyangze, and the highway from Chengdu to Aba, have all been opened to traffic. Dozens of newly built ships and larger seaport projects have also been completed. Basic construction generally progresses slowly in the first half of the year and faster in the second half of the year. However, due to the excessively slow progress in the first half of the year, the actual results for ten months only reached 65.1% of the annual basic construction investment plan, of which the construction and installation workload only reached 64.2% of the annual plan. The reasons for the slow progress of basic construction are mainly the late determination of the plan, poor work arrangements, insufficient technical strength to meet the needs, design lagging behind construction, and poor construction management. Some construction projects lacked prior consideration or were not well considered, the design progress was particularly slow, and the design review and approval work was delayed, which seriously affected the progress of the plan. The weak construction technical force and poor labor organization not only delayed the progress of the work, but also caused a large amount of rework and waste. Some highway bridges had to be demolished and rebuilt due to poor quality. The construction of a deep-water wharf in a certain seaport was delayed until September due to the failure to quickly solve the pile driving technology problem. Due to this reason, the idling loss of this seaport project in the first half of the year alone reached more than 70,000 yuan. In June alone, the five highway engineering bureaus had 178,000 unused workdays due to waiting for work, waiting for materials, and absenteeism. It can be seen that determining the plan in advance, arranging work properly, actively training and assembling technical forces, and conscientiously doing a good job in various preparatory work before construction, especially in the design, material preparation, technical organization measures, and leadership of construction organization, are the key to ensuring the completion of the basic construction plan. At the same time, it must also be recognized that improving labor productivity is the fundamental guarantee for accelerating the construction speed, and that implementing the piece-rate wage system is an important measure to improve labor productivity. There are already many examples showing that due to the implementation of the piece-rate wage system, the construction efficiency has been greatly improved, and it seems that the construction management level has lagged behind the masses. It seems that it is not the cadres who are urging the construction, but the workers who are urging the cadres to improve their management level. Next year, each construction department should implement the piece-rate wage system in a planned manner according to specific conditions.

    The time limit for this year's basic construction projects is already very tight, but the construction progress in various places has been faster in the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. As long as we work harder, it is possible to basically complete the annual plan or complete the plan entirely. All basic construction units should make every effort to catch up with this year's plan progress under the established design requirements, construction deployment, and technical safety conditions!

    The production plans of the ship repair factories this year have been completed relatively well. Nine factories overfulfilled the quarterly gross output value plan in the first to third quarters. The Guangzhou Shipyard completed the annual gross output value plan 40 days ahead of schedule. According to the actual results of all ship repair factories from January to October and the estimated figures for two months, the gross output value plan can reach 105.3% of the annual plan. However, it should be pointed out that the production management of the ship repair factories is still backward. The imbalance of work types and the phenomenon of relying on overtime work to complete the plan must be changed. Ship repair is seriously overdue, and the valuation is too high. The quality of ship repair is low, and there are many rework defects. Some ship repair factories use extremely backward quotas for production, and some ship repair factories are not good at using the existing mechanical equipment. As Comrade Grisenko, a Soviet expert, said: "A lathe with the speed of an ox cart can complete the quota and get an extra bonus. Why should the workers use high-speed cutting? It is unbelievable that a factory does not use machinery but uses manpower to lift pig iron and coke, and that there are engineers working in this factory." We should see that the equipment conditions of the ship repair factories are better, and the problem is that we have not made full use of these conditions. This year, Soviet experts inspected various ship repair factories and put forward many good suggestions. Each factory must conscientiously implement these suggestions. Each factory should do a good job in the production and technical preparation work before construction, strengthen technical management, make full use of existing technical equipment, strictly implement the inspection system, especially the construction process inspection and the completion technical inspection, strengthen the responsibility system, and quickly improve the quality of ship repair. The factory director, management personnel, technical personnel, and workers should all conscientiously study technology and improve the level of production management.

    The savings tasks of various transportation enterprises and institutions have also made some achievements. The savings in the second half of this year are equal to 4.7% of the state's economic appropriation for the whole year, of which non-productive construction saves 38.2%. The highway basic construction departments generally carried out mass movements to practice economy and oppose waste, and achieved results. However, increasing production and practicing economy is our long-term task. In the current and future work, we must continue to mobilize the masses of employees in depth and institutionalize the saving work.

    At present, we still have a lot of work to do. In addition to striving to complete the annual plan, we must continue to mobilize the masses to thoroughly carry out the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, and strictly prevent the sabotage of all counter-revolutionaries and bad elements; we must properly arrange next year's production, especially the production in the first quarter of next year, do a good job in ideological education, and prevent slack emotions; the administrative and trade union organizations of enterprises at all levels should closely cooperate and further set off a new upsurge of labor emulation, emphasize production quality, implement the saving system, and push the emulation to a new climax.

    提高质量，加快速度，保证完成今年计划，妥善安排明年工作
    交通部副部长　李运昌
    一九五五年转瞬就将结束，新的任务已经摆在我们面前。努力完成今年的计划并且妥善安排明年生产和基本建设工作，是当前头等紧要的事情。
    江海运输在过去的十个多月中，已经做了不少的工作。根据十个月生产实绩和两个月预计完成的数字看，江海货运量可达年度计划的百分之一○三，货物周转量可达百分之一○一，沿海六个海港吞吐任务可达百分之九十六。海港企业再加一把劲，完成计划也是可能的。目前黑龙江航运局已经超额完成年计划，并且做好了江水封冻前的船舶卧冬工作，接着开展了冰撬运输的试验。各江海运输企业除了努力执行年度计划外，还担负了巨大的临时性的紧急运输任务，取得了一定的成绩。
    那么我们是否满足于今年年度计划的完成情况呢？不。为了使生产指标达到五年计划要求的水平，还必须作更艰巨的努力。应该看到，江海运输工作的缺点很多，问题不少。固然，今年江海运输业务上曾经遇到一些困难，如部分航线中有些货源改变了流向。这些客观情况的变化，确实引起了各企业执行计划的一些困难。但是，这些客观因素都不是问题的主要方面。主要的问题是我们运输组织工作做得差。应该指出，过去长江航线由东往西的上水货源组织工作和沿海自上海往北的货源组织工作，是不能令人满意的。沿江自汉口以下的七个江海港口企业，上半年由于没有摸清长江下游的货源分布状况，一至五月份货源组织只达计划的百分之七十六，这就造成了大批回程轮驳亏儎和部分船舶空驶或停航。船舶和港口货物装卸的调度工作也不能令人满意，上半年长江全线有三分之二的船舶没有纳入运行图，作业计划质量很低，主要港口到船发船密度极不均衡，造成了港口货物积压和运输迟缓。港口货物装卸效率还落在计划后面。沿海重点港如大连、上海等港口第三季度的工班效率比第二季度降低百分之六，长江各主要港口第三季度的装卸效率比第二季度降低百分之二。这就造成了船舶周转效率减低，非生产性停泊时间延长。第三季度长江以及长江口以北沿海各主要港口的六项非生产性停泊时间加在一起，相当于三万四千吨轮船全季没有航行，运力浪费是十分惊人的。至于运输质量低更是我们水运工作上的一个严重问题。年初长江镒源轮沉没，造成了不应有的死亡事故，上海民主三号轮在浙东沿海触礁沉搁，虽抢救得力没有死人，但是国家财产的损失是巨大的。上半年货物运输的差错和残损现象仍十分严重，西南下运的粮食有些遭受霉烂，部分桐油变质。损坏了国家物资，延误了供应，加大了赔偿费用，增加了运输成本，并且损害了水运的信誉。加以水运运价原来偏高，其结果使不合理的运输增加了，有的物资原来应该利用水运由上海运往西南的，现在却改变了运输路线，绕道宝成铁路转公路运往成都了。所有这一切，都说明了水运的经营管理水平仍然落后，没有能充分发挥水路运输运量大、运价低的优点，更好地为国民经济服务。那些片面埋怨托运部门不给货运或者认为国家计划要求过高的看法和想法都是错误的。我们必须赶上去，把航运企业经营管理水平、生产质量和生产效率提高一步。
    今年还有不到一个月的时间。这一段时间是运输生产十分宝贵的时间，各江海运输企业都应该在合理运输的原则下，积极做好货源组织工作，特别应该使回程轮驳得到较多的货儎。长江全线应该加强船舶调度工作和港口货物装卸工作，务使川江下运货物尽可能直达运行，大力减少货物中转运输。各航运和港口企业都应该切实做好冬季航行安全措施和货物装卸安全措施，确实保证旅客运输的安全。各企业的负责人员应该亲自上船、亲自到装卸现场检查各种安全设施。要严格执行技术操作规程，注意货物堆存、包装和标志，加强现场作业检查，坚决消灭货损货差，以提高运输质量为中心一环，务使其他一切管理措施全面赶上去。
    今年的基本建设工程，从拉萨到日喀则和从日喀则到江孜的两条公路以及成都到阿坝公路都已经通车。新建的几十艘轮船和较大的海港工程也已经完成。基本建设一般是上半年进度慢，下半年进度快。但是由于上半年进度过于迟缓了，十个月的实绩也只达全年基本建设投资计划的百分之六十五点一，其中建筑安装工作量只达年计划的百分之六十四点二。基本建设进展迟慢的原因主要是计划确定得迟，工作安排得不好，技术力量赶不上需要，设计落后于施工，施工管理差等。有些建设工程事先缺乏考虑或考虑不周，设计进度特别缓慢，设计审核工作和审批工作拖拉，严重地影响了计划进度。施工技术力量薄弱和劳动组织不好，不仅延缓了工作进度，并且造成了大量的返工浪费。有些公路桥梁由于质量低劣，不得不拆桩重建。有个海港深水码头的建设，由于未能迅速解决打桩技术问题，边打边试，一直延迟到九月份才试成。这个海港工程由于这个原因，仅上半年窝工损失即达七万元以上。五个公路工程局仅六月份一个月，因待工、待料、缺勤等未被利用的工作日达十七万八千个。由此可见，提前确定计划，妥善安排工作，积极培养和集结技术力量，切实做好施工前的各项准备工作，特别是做好设计、备料、技术组织措施和施工组织的领导工作，是保证基本建设计划完成的关键。同时还必须认识：提高劳动生产率是加快施工速度的根本保证，而推行计件工资制则是提高劳动生产率的重要措施。现在已经有许多事例表明，由于推行了计件工资制，施工效率大为提高，反而显得施工管理水平已落后于群众，好像不是干部在督促施工，而是职工群众在督促干部提高自己的管理水平了。明年各施工部门应该根据具体条件有计划地推行计件工资制。
    今年基本建设工程的时限已经很紧迫，但是下半年特别是第四季度各地施工进度较快，只要再加
  一把劲，基本上完成年度计划或全部完成计划都是有可能的。各基本建设单位都应该在既定的设计要求、施工部署以及技术安全的条件下，尽一切努力赶上今年的计划进度！
    今年各修船工厂生产计划完成的情况是较好的。一至三季度有九个厂超额完成季度生产总值计划。广州修船厂提前四十天完成了全年生产总值计划。根据全部修船工厂一至十月份实绩和两个月预计数字看，生产总值计划可达年计划的百分之一○五点三。但是应该指明，目前各修船工厂的生产管理还是落后的。工种不平衡，依靠加班加点来完成计划的现象必须加以改变。修船脱期严重，估价偏高。修船质量低，返工废品多。有的修船厂以极落后的定额来进行生产，有的修船厂不善于发挥现有的机械设备的作用。正如苏联专家格里森克同志所说：“像牛车一样的车床速度可以完成定额拿到超额奖金，工人又何必利用高速切削呢？不利用机械而用人力去抬生铁和焦炭，不能相信这个工厂还有工程师在工作。”我们应该看到修船工厂的设备条件是较好的，问题在于我们没有充分利用这些条件。今年苏联专家在视察各修船工厂后提出了许多好的建议，各厂必须认真实行这些建议。各厂要做好施工前的生产技术准备工作，加强技术管理，充分利用现有各种技术设备，严格检验制度，特别是施工过程检验和竣工技术检验，加强责任制度，迅速提高修船质量。厂长、管理人员、技术人员和职工，都应该认真学习技术，把生产管理水平提高一步。
    各交通企业和事业单位的节约任务也做出了一些成绩，今年下半年节约的款项等于全年国家经济拨款的百分之四点七，其中非生产性建设节约百分之三十八点二。各公路基本建设部门一般的都开展了厉行节约反对浪费的群众运动，并且取得了成绩。但是，增加生产厉行节约是我们的长期任务。在当前和今后的工作中，还必须继续深入发动职工群众，把节约工作制度化。
    当前，我们还有许多工作要做，除了努力完成年度计划外，还必须继续发动群众深入开展肃清一切反革命分子的斗争，严防一切反革命分子和坏分子的破坏；必须妥善安排明年的生产特别是明年第一季度的生产，做好思想教育工作，防止松劲情绪；各级企业行政同工会组织应该密切联系配合，进一步掀起劳动竞赛的热潮，强调生产质量，贯彻执行节约制度，把竞赛推向新的高涨。
