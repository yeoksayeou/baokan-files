    China Made Its First Automatic Coal Loader
    China's first self-made automatic coal loader was officially put into production on December 1 at the Jinzhou Railway Administration Locomotive Depot.
    This automatic coal loader is 46.9 meters high. Its main accessories number more than 2,800.
    This automatic coal loader has a large coal storage capacity and operates quickly. Replacing manual coal loading with it can reduce heavy physical labor. For example, in the past, the Jinzhou Locomotive Depot used six workers to carry coal in baskets to load 14 tons of coal onto a 冖ㄎ1 type locomotive, which took 28 minutes. Now, it only takes two workers one minute and ten seconds to load 14 tons of coal. Calculating on a three-shift basis day and night (including workers unloading coal cars), the Jinzhou Locomotive Depot can save more than half of its labor force as a result.
    The successful trial production of the automatic coal loader has opened the way for the widespread use of automatic coal loaders in China's railways. (Ke Fu)

    我国制成第一台自动上煤机
    我国自己制造的第一台自动上煤机，十二月一日在锦州铁路管理局机务段正式投入生产。
    这台自动上煤机高达四十六点九公尺。它的主要配件有二千八百多件。
    这台自动上煤机贮煤量大、动作迅速，用它代替人工上煤，可以减轻笨重的体力劳动。如锦州机务段过去给冖ㄎ1型机车上十四吨煤，由六个工人用筐抬，需时二十八分钟，现在只要两个工人，仅用一分十秒就可以上满十四吨煤了。以日夜三班计算（包括卸煤车的工人），锦州机务段可以因此节省出一半以上的劳动力。
    自动上煤机的试制成功，给我国铁路广泛使用自动上煤机开辟了道路。　（克夫）
