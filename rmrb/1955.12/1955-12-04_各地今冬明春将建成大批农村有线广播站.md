A total of 225 rural wired broadcasting stations will be built in 21 provinces, 3 cities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region this winter and next spring. The Broadcasting Affairs Bureau has allocated 450,000 yuan in subsidies for the construction of these stations. The newly built Gao'an County Broadcasting Station in Jiangxi Province has installed 221 loudspeakers in 88 townships, and more than 20,000 people listened to the broadcast on its first day of operation. Jiangxi Province plans to build stations in nine more counties this year.

With the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, people's broadcasting stations in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hebei, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, and Gansu provinces have all formulated plans for developing rural wired broadcasting stations from 1955 to 1957. Jilin and Fujian provinces plan to establish a broadcasting station in every county by 1957, and loudspeakers will be installed in districts, townships, and some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in each county. Zhejiang Province plans to establish more than 50 broadcasting stations and install more than 10,000 loudspeakers by 1957. Assuming an average of 30 listeners per loudspeaker, 300,000 farmers across the province will be able to hear the broadcasts.

The existing rural wired broadcasting stations can promptly convey and explain policies to farmers and report on current events at home and abroad. Local Communist Party organizations and people's governments often use broadcasting stations to quickly communicate and deploy central tasks of the moment. Broadcasting stations also promote and impart agricultural science and technology according to the farming season and broadcast literary and artistic programs, which are very popular among farmers. In many places, farmers voluntarily contribute money and labor to request relevant departments to build stations. Of the more than 100 broadcasting stations that have been established in 13 provinces across the country, most were built with funds raised by the farmers themselves. The vast majority of rural wired broadcasting stations operate under the leadership of the propaganda departments of the local CCP county committees. The CCP committees of Jilin, Liaoning, Guangdong, Anhui, and other provinces have successively convened relevant meetings or issued notices for the construction of broadcasting stations. Relevant departments of governments at all levels have also provided a great deal of assistance in terms of funding and equipment for station construction. (Xinhua News Agency)

    各地今冬明春将建成大批农村有线广播站
    全国二十一个省、三个市和内蒙古自治区将在今冬明春建成二百二十五个农村有线广播站。广播事业局已经为此拨出建站补助费四十五万元。江西省新建的高安县广播站在八十八个乡里安装了二百二十一个喇叭，播音开始的第一天就有两万多人收听。江西省今年还准备在九个县里建站。
    随着农业合作化运动高潮的到来，黑龙江、吉林、河北、山西、浙江、福建、湖南和甘肃等省的人民广播电台都分别订出了一九五五年到一九五七年发展农村有线广播站的计划。吉林、福建等省准备到一九五七年在全省每个县里都建立一个广播站，每个县的区、乡和部分农业生产合作社、互助组都将安上喇叭。浙江省计划到一九五七年建立起五十个以上的广播站，安装一万多只喇叭，以每只喇叭平均有三十个听众计算，全省将有三十万农民可以听到广播。
    现有的农村有线广播站都能及时地向农民传达和讲解政策，报告国内外的时事；各地中国共产党组织和人民政府经常通过广播站迅速地传达和布置当前的中心任务。广播站还按农时季节推广和传授农业科学技术，并且广播文艺节目，深受到了农民的欢迎。许多地方的农民都自愿出钱出力要求有关部门建站。现在全国十三个省已经建立的一百多个广播站中，大部分是农民自筹经费建设的。绝大多数的农村有线广播站是在当地中共县委会宣传部领导下进行工作的。中共吉林、辽宁、广东、安徽等省的委员会为了建设广播站曾先后召开了有关的会议或发出通知。各级政府有关部门在建站经费和器材等方面也都给予很多帮助。（新华社）
