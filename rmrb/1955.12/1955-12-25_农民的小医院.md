    The Farmers' Little Hospital
    Shen Jie
    The news that the farmers of Shidong Township in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, have a "little hospital" has spread throughout the surrounding area. Farmers from neighboring villages who come to visit agricultural cooperatives always like to see the "little hospital" first, and cadres from the province and county also want to see it.
    Shidong Township's "little hospital" was established on November 25, 1954. At that time, eight agricultural cooperatives had already been established in the township. After the farmers organized themselves, the difficulties in production were generally overcome, but the problem of medical treatment for the cooperative members was not easily solved. When cooperative members got sick, they had to travel several miles, cross the Tuo River, to see a doctor in Shijia Street, which was time-consuming and expensive. The Shidong Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party and the heads of the various agricultural cooperatives jointly studied this problem and suggested establishing a joint health station for the agricultural cooperatives. After discussion by the cooperative members, it was unanimously agreed. Without a house, the cooperative members jointly renovated two dilapidated houses; without medicines, the county health department provided some assistance, and some public welfare funds were drawn from the old cooperatives to buy them; as for doctors, it happened that cooperative members included traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Liu Yulin, Western medicine practitioner Liao Zhongkun, and female cooperative member Wang Zongyin also had some midwifery knowledge. After discussion by the various agricultural cooperatives, they were appointed as doctors and health workers. The cooperatives paid them fixed labor remuneration according to their technical expertise and the quality of their work, based on the population of each agricultural cooperative. After these preparations were completed, the "little hospital" of the eight agricultural cooperatives in Shidong Township—the joint health station—was established (it has now been changed to a joint health station for fifteen cooperatives).
    The doctors and health workers at the health station are very concerned about the health of all cooperative members. Health worker Wang Zongyin is proactive and responsible, ensuring that more than thirty pregnant women safely give birth to their children and that the children are well cared for. Usually, when cooperative members get sick, regardless of whether it is sunny or rainy, day or night, as long as they go to the health station, the doctors diagnose and treat them with great enthusiasm. If cooperative members have an emergency, even at night, the doctors will carry their medicine kits to the patient's home to diagnose and treat them upon receiving the message. During the busy farming season, the doctors carry their medicine kits and make rounds to each cooperative for treatment. Zheng Qingyun, a cooperative member of the Fenghuang Agricultural Cooperative, suffered from damp heat syndrome, and his throat was ulcerated, making him unable to eat or speak. His family was weeping and preparing a coffin. Just at this time, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Liu Yulin, who was on a mobile treatment tour, came here and immediately tried to give him emergency treatment. Later, he went to his home more than twenty times in succession, finally restoring Zheng Qingyun to health.
    The establishment of the health station not only enabled the cooperative members to receive timely diagnosis and treatment for their illnesses, ensuring their health, but also saved the cooperative members a lot of money. In the past, cooperative members had to pay registration fees to see a doctor in the market, pay consultation fees to invite a doctor, and pay ferry fees to cross the river. With their own health station, the cooperative members have saved these expenses. In the past year, the health station has treated cooperative members 9,254 times, saving the cooperative members a total of about 1,200 yuan in outpatient fees, river crossing fees, and pharmaceutical profit fees. At the same time, because the health station is located in the township, where the masses live in a concentrated area, and the methods of delivering medicine to the door and mobile treatment are adopted, the time for cooperative members to travel to the market for treatment is greatly reduced, freeing up more time for production. It is estimated that each visit to the health station saves at least two hours, saving approximately 2,300 workdays per year (calculated on the basis of eight hours of work per day).
    Because the health station solves the cooperative members' medical treatment problems, the cooperative members cherish the health station very much and are concerned about its development, calling it their own "little hospital." Now, this health station has more than 220 kinds of Chinese medicines and more than 250 kinds of Western medicines. The fifteen agricultural cooperatives in the township have all achieved increased production this year, and each cooperative has set aside 1% of its public welfare fund in accordance with the principle of increased production and increased public accumulation. The township has set aside a total of more than 2,500 yuan, and plans to allocate 30% of it for the health and welfare of the cooperative members.
    In addition to treating cooperative members, the health station also treats non-cooperative members, charging only a small registration fee and consultation fee. Farmers outside the cooperative feel that the health station is very beneficial to them. Yan Shaoqing, a poor peasant in Sangyuan Township, had a child who developed bronchitis, a high fever all over his body, and became unconscious. He went to Chajiashan market to see a doctor, who said he could not be saved. Later, he heard that the agricultural cooperative in Shidong Township had a "little hospital," so he and his wife braved the rain and took their child to see a doctor at the health station. That night, the doctor examined his child six or seven times and gave him four injections. The next day, the fever subsided. Before leaving, the doctor also let him take some medicine for the child to take. A few days later, the child recovered, and he and his wife talked everywhere about the benefits of collectivization and the benefits of the little hospital. Soon after, he applied to join the agricultural cooperative.

    农民的小医院
    沈杰
    四川省内江县史东乡农民有了“小医院”的消息，已经在附近一带传开了。邻村来参观农业合作社的农民总爱先看看“小医院”，省里、县里来的干部也要看看“小医院”。
    史东乡的“小医院”是一九五四年十一月二十五日成立的。当时，全乡已经建立了八个农业合作社。农民组织起来之后，生产上的困难一般地都克服了，唯独社员的治病问题不好解决。社员生了病，要跑好几里路，渡过沱江，到史家街去看，往返费时费钱。中共史东乡支部和各个农业合作社的负责人共同研究了这个问题，建议成立农业合作社联合保健站。经社员讨论，一致同意了。没有房子，社员们共同整修了二间破房子；没有药品，县卫生科给了些帮助，并且从老社中抽出一些公益金来买；医生呢，恰恰社员中有中医刘玉林、西医廖仲昆，女社员王宗银也有些接生常识，经过各个农业合作社的讨论，让他们作了医生和保健员。合作社按照他们的技术特长，工作好坏，由各个农业合作社按人口多少付给他们固定的劳动报酬。这些工作准备好了以后，史东乡八个农业合作社的“小医院”——联合保健站成立了（现在已经改为十五个社的联合保健站）。
    保健站的医生和保健员对全体社员的健康非常关心。保健员王宗银积极负责，使三十多个孕妇都安全地生下孩子，并且把孩子养得很好。平时社员们得了病，不管天晴下雨，白天黑夜，只要到了保健站，医生都很热心地诊断治疗。社员得了急症，就是夜里，医生得到信也要背着药包到病人家里去诊治。每到农忙的时候，医生就背着药包一个社一个社地巡回治疗。凤凰农业合作社社员郑清云，患了湿瘟症，喉头烧烂了，吃不下饭，说不出话。一家人哭哭啼啼，并且准备了棺材。正在这时候，从事巡回治疗的中医刘玉林来到这里，马上设法急救，后来连续到他家看了二十多次，终于使郑清云恢复了健康。
    保健站的成立，不仅使社员的疾病得到了及时诊治，保障了社员的健康，而且为社员节省了很多钱。过去社员到场上看病，挂号要出挂号费，请医生要出出诊费，过河要出过渡费……。社员们有了自己的保健站，这些开支都节省了。近一年来，保健站共给社员治病九千二百五十四人次，社员们共节约门诊费、过河费、医药利润费约一千二百多元。同时由于保健站设在本乡，群众居住集中，又采用送药上门、巡回治疗的办法，大大地减少了社员到场上治病的往返时间，可以腾出更多的时间从事生产。据估计，到保健站每治一次病至少要节省两小时，一年约节省劳动日二千三百多个（按每日工作八小时计算）。
    由于保健站解决了社员的治病问题，社员十分爱护保健站和关心它的发展，都称它为自己的“小医院”。现在这个保健站已有中药二百二十多种，西药二百五十多种。全乡十五个农业合作社今年又都获得增产，各社都按照生产增加、公共积累增多的原则，提留公益金百分之一，全乡共提留二千五百多元，准备从中抽出百分之三十，作为社员卫生福利事业之用。
    保健站除给社员看病之外，还给非社员看病，只收一点门诊挂号费和出诊费。社外的农民都感到保健站对自己很有好处。桑园乡贫农晏少清的孩子得了支气管炎，浑身发热，昏迷不醒，到茶家山场上去看，医生说没有救了。后来他听说史东乡农业社有个“小医院”，便和他的爱人冒雨抱着孩子找保健站的医生看。当天夜里，医生给他的小孩看了六、七次，打了四针，第二天就退了热；临走的时候，医生又让他带了一些药，给孩子吃。几天以后，孩子的病好了，他两口子到处讲合作化的好处，小医院的好处，不久他便申请加入了农业合作社。
