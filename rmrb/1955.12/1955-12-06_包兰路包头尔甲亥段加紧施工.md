Construction on the Baotou-Eerji Hai Section of the Baolan Railway Intensifies

Construction on the Baotou to Eerji Hai section of the Baolan Railway is being intensified. The Second Daosha River bridge project along the railway has already started pile driving, and thousands of workers along the line are filling and excavating the roadbed. On the sections of the roadbed where mechanized construction is used, bulldozers and scrapers are running back and forth continuously. This section of the railway has to pass through two marshy areas, with the water level above the ground, making winter construction even more difficult. However, the workers have now prepared all kinds of cold-weather equipment and put forward the slogans "Overcome the Marshes" and "Overcome the Severe Cold," preparing to lay 26 kilometers of track before the end of this year and to prepare for next year's construction work.

The Party and government organs of Baotou City and the broad masses of the people are enthusiastically supporting the construction of the Baolan Railway. Hundreds of civilian workers from Baotou City have joined the road construction team. The Baotou Quarry and the Inner Mongolia Road Construction Engineering Team have supplied a large number of flagstones and crushed stones. More than 100 rubber-wheeled carts from the Baotou City Transportation Company, and a large number of ox and horse carts from the peasants, are all transporting river sand and crushed stone to various construction sites. Units such as the post and telecommunications bureau and the bank have sent a large number of staff to reside permanently at the construction sites to solve problems such as employee mailing and deposits. The automobile company's public buses have specially increased the number of trips for employees. Peasants in Wanshuiquan and other places in the suburbs of Baotou City, seeing that the railway was going to pass through their villages, gladly lent their houses to the workers and also led the workers to find sand and gravel everywhere.

    包兰路包头尔甲亥段加紧施工
    包兰铁路包头到尔甲亥段，正在加紧施工。这条铁路所经过的二道砂河桥梁工程已经开始打桩，沿线数千名工人正在填挖路基，部分采用机械化施工的路基上，成群的推土机和铲运机来回奔跑不停。这段铁路要经过两处泥沼地带，水位在地面以上，因此在冬季施工更加困难。但是，目前工人们已经准备好了各种防寒设备，提出“战胜泥沼”“战胜严寒”的口号，准备在今年年底以前铺轨二十六公里，并且要做好明年的施工准备工作。
    包头市党、政机关和广大人民热烈支援修建包兰铁路的工作。包头市数百名民工参加了筑路队伍。包头采石厂和内蒙古筑路工程队供应了大批的片石和碎石。包头市运输公司的一百多辆胶轮大车，和农民的大批牛马车，都纷纷向各工地运送河沙、碎石。邮电局和银行等单位派了大批工作人员常住工地，解决职工寄信、存款等问题。汽车公司的公共汽车特为职工增加了行车的班次。包头市郊区万水泉等地农民看到铁路要路过他们的村子，都高兴地借出房屋给工人住，还领着工人们到处寻找砂石。
