    The ZI Gong Salt Industry Basically Implemented Joint Public-Private Ownership
    Mou Haixiu, Secretary of the ZI Gong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Sichuan Province
    ZI Gong is a salt-producing city in the Southwest. It now produces 400,000 tons of well salt annually, which can supply most of the people in the Southwest for consumption. Chemical by-products are also developing rapidly. Over the past five years, due to the socialist transformation of private salt enterprises by the state, more than 90 percent of the city's private salt industry has embarked on the road of joint public-private ownership.
    In the early days of liberation, ZI Gong salt fields experienced production shrinkage, with most wells and stoves closing down. Production, transportation, and sales were all controlled by big capitalists. Although the state confiscated bureaucratic capitalist enterprises and established state-owned salt factories, it was still difficult to lead and control the production and sales of the entire salt field. In private enterprises, the production of brine was also extremely uneven. Large capitalists had both brine wells and salt stoves and also engaged in transportation and sales. Small and medium-sized capitalists had stoves but no brine, or brine but no stoves. As a result, a situation arose where methane gas was being wasted on the one hand, while coal was being used to boil salt on the other. Brine pipelines were also operated by private merchants. Other major raw materials such as steel ropes, galvanized iron sheets, and coal were also mostly in the hands of big capitalists. After the salt was stored in warehouses, capitalists could freely buy and sell warehouse receipts, resulting in multiple prices in a single day, driving up the market or selling at low prices, and small producers suffered extreme exploitation. As a result, salt field production suffered great damage and constraints, a large number of workers lost their jobs, and production was difficult to maintain. In response to this situation, we began the socialist transformation of the private salt industry in the second half of 1950. We banned speculative private merchants and established a water transportation company to uniformly purchase and allocate brine. Subsequently, a salt industry company was established to be responsible for the unified purchase of salt production and planned supply of major raw materials. From then on, ZI Gong salt fields were all included in the intermediate form of state capitalism of unified purchase and sales. In addition, with the state's continuous investment and loan support for the salt fields, about 80 percent of the enterprises had resumed production by 1951, a large number of workers were employed, and large and small capitalists also received appropriate profits. In early 1951, the government accepted the capitalists' request to implement joint public-private ownership of the Jiu Da Salt Industry Company, which had almost ceased production.
    Although the private enterprises in the ZI Gong salt fields had undergone preliminary transformation, production was still in a decentralized and backward state because the production relations of most enterprises had not changed, which could not meet the needs of national industrial development and the growing needs of the people's lives. Capitalists still adopted various speculative and profit-seeking methods to operate. In addition, bloated organizations and chaotic management seriously hindered the further improvement of well salt production, quality, and cost reduction, and private salt enterprises encountered great difficulties in maintaining production.
    In 1954, a group of capitalists received education on the general task of the state during the transition period, saw the significant achievements made by the Jiu Da Salt Industry Company after joint public-private ownership, recognized the future of the enterprises and individuals, and requested joint public-private ownership. Based on the needs and possibilities of the state, we implemented joint public-private ownership of 29 large enterprises and established the Joint Public-Private Jian Hua Salt Production Company. Under the principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, this year, we adopted the method of large enterprises leading small enterprises and advanced enterprises leading backward enterprises, and merged 72 production enterprises into Jiu Da and Jian Hua companies respectively, and implemented joint public-private ownership of the entire industry in stages and batches. Now, well and stove enterprises with more than ten employees in ZI Gong salt fields have embarked on the advanced form of state capitalism. Up to now, the proportion of state-owned and joint public-private salt industries in the city's total salt production value has risen from 71.31 percent in 1954 to the current 93.02 percent, and the socialist economic component has occupied an absolute advantage.
    Achieving joint public-private ownership is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. Capitalists raised the quality of assets and overvalued prices during the asset inventory and valuation process. Some even raised prices with each other or sold accumulated means of production in an attempt to withdraw funds. In response to these situations, we repeatedly conducted policy education on "fair and reasonable, seeking truth from facts" for the capitalists, and organized several professional asset inventory and valuation teams to negotiate asset inventory and valuation standards and conduct in-depth on-site typical trial valuations with the joint participation of both public and private parties, and finally re-examine and determine shares. For some complex issues, we also invited specialized personnel to participate and put forward opinions. Due to meticulous work and full consultation, the private parties were more satisfied. In addition, we also strictly criticized some capitalists' illegal acts; those who performed better were praised.
    The struggle over the arrangement of personnel in substantive positions was also very complex. There was a struggle between private capitalists and state representatives in the enterprise for leadership, and there was also a struggle between private individuals for status. Large, medium, and small capitalists all had concerns. Large capitalists were afraid of not being able to become managers or section chiefs and were unwilling to merge with the Jiu Da Salt Industry Company; medium and small capitalists hesitated and watched, thinking that large capitalists may not be able to secure a position, so what hope did they have, and generally reflected: "It's better to be a clerk." Old and weak capitalists wanted to find a position with high status, high salary, and little responsibility; some were afraid of not finding anything to do. In response to this situation, we successively held several symposiums for capitalists, explained the policies from the front, dispelled concerns, repeatedly explained the principle of assigning jobs according to talents, the public party proposed a list of arrangements, fully consulted with the private party and passed it, and finally asked the higher authorities to appoint them. As a result of careful arrangements, among the 55 capitalists, three were arranged as deputy managers, one as section chief, four as deputy section chiefs, eighteen as deputy directors, and the rest were assigned to general work, and the old and weak were also taken care of.
    After reorganization and transformation, the face of the ZI Gong salt industry has been completely renewed.
    In accordance with the management principles of socialist enterprises, we have gradually organized more than one hundred small wells and small stoves within a 30-mile radius into two large companies. In these two companies, 17 large workshops are formed by combining seven or eight small wells and stoves in a region-based way. Due to the establishment and improvement of the enterprise management mechanism, well salt production has changed from the decentralized and backward handicraft production method of the past to large-scale production. In these two enterprises, we have promoted planned management, established financial systems, stipulated various quotas, and strengthened technical management. Some outdated production equipment has been extensively renovated and rebuilt. In the year since the Jian Hua Company's joint public-private ownership, it has repaired seven boilers, replaced two new boilers, overhauled 14 brine-absorbing winches, expanded and rebuilt factory buildings, and doubled the production scale. Four years ago, the Jiu Da Company had only two rented brine wells and three flat pans, with 157 employees. Now it has 39 brine wells, 14 methane wells, 124 charcoal stoves, and 3,549 employees. The total value of assets has increased more than four times. In addition, it has also expanded the chemical by-product workshop, producing a variety of valuable products such as borax, boric acid, bromine, and potassium chloride.
    After joint public-private ownership, the vast number of employees were even more jubilant. Many people regarded this as a major event in their lives. During the process of joint public-private ownership, employees successively put forward the slogan of "Do a good job in production and welcome joint public-private ownership." Wang Jianzhang, a salt-burning worker at the Lisheng Second Factory, overcame the phenomenon of producing defective products and actively helped others improve operations and increase output. In the past four years, employees of the Jiu Da Company have put forward 1,859 rationalization proposals, and promoted and created four major advanced experiences such as in-tube brine extraction devices and soilless salt production methods. After the in-tube brine extraction device was promoted in 14 brine wells, the output generally increased by more than 15 percent. Due to the increased labor enthusiasm of employees and technicians, labor productivity increased by 37.75 percent. In the first half of this year, after the Jian Hua Company's joint public-private ownership in the second half of last year, the output of brine increased by 32 percent compared with the same period last year, and the output of salt increased by 28 percent; the defective product rate decreased from 1.23 percent to 1.08 percent, and the cost also decreased by 7.61 percent compared with before.
    With the development of production, the working conditions and material welfare of employees have also been greatly improved. In recent years, more than 19,200 square meters of new employee dormitories have been built. In the past, workers slept on bamboo boards in the summer and huddled in bamboo mats in the winter. Now they have all happily moved into new homes. In the past, workers worked in low and stuffy stove rooms. In the hot summer, some workers fainted. Now, the factory buildings are not only equipped with better ventilation equipment, but also the Jiu Da Company's Second Salt Production Plant is also equipped with rooftop sprinklers. In the methane stove rooms, chimneys for removing sulfur dioxide gas have also been set up. Due to the improvement of medical facilities, the employee injury rate has decreased by 59.07 percent in recent years. Wages are also increasing year by year.
    After the implementation of joint public-private ownership, the income of capitalists has also increased. Taking Jian Hua Company as an example, although production was not yet normal in the initial stage of joint ownership, the profits obtained by capitalists were still 6.25 percent higher than during private operation. From January to October of this year, profits increased by one and a half times compared with the same period last year. These facts have made the capitalists deeply realize that taking the road of joint public-private ownership is not only beneficial to the country and to production, but also beneficial to themselves.
    In recent years, due to the gradual strengthening of the transformation of enterprises and bourgeois elements, most capitalists have been able to perform their duties conscientiously. Mao Xuezhen, an agent of the capitalist, has undergone great changes after years of transformation and education, and has made contributions to his work. He has strived to join the trade union and has become a member of the working class. Mao Xuezhen's future shows the bright road for capitalists who honestly accept transformation. However, not all capitalists have recognized this point. Some capitalists still do not accept transformation well. Due to their profit-seeking class nature, some are still secretly competing with public shares for leadership, spreading bourgeois business views, sowing discord, distorting joint public-private ownership policies, only seeking profits, and disregarding national interests and the safety of workers' lives. These facts show that the class struggle within joint public-private enterprises is still sharp. We must continue to strengthen the transformation of enterprises and bourgeois elements, strengthen political education, and gradually transform exploiters into self-reliant laborers.

    自贡盐业基本上实行了公私合营
    中共四川省自贡市委书记  牟海秀
    自贡是西南的一个产盐城市。现在年产井盐四十万吨，可供西南大部人民食用。化工副产也在日益发展。五年多来，由于国家对私营盐业进行了社会主义改造，全市百分之九十以上的私营盐业已走上了公私合营的道路。
    解放初期，自贡盐场生产萎缩，井灶大部倒闭，产、运、销全部为大资本家所控制。国家虽然没收了官僚资本主义企业，建立了国营盐厂，但是对整个盐场的生产和销售仍然难于领导掌握。在私营企业中，盐卤的生产也极不平衡。大资本家既有卤井，又有盐灶，还兼营运销。中小资本家有灶无卤，或有卤无灶。于是就出现了这样一种情况：一方面在浪费瓦斯，一方面又以煤来煎盐。送卤管道也都是私商经营。其他的主要原材料如钢绳、白铁皮、煤炭等，也大部掌握在大资本家手里。盐入仓后，资本家可以持仓单自由买卖，日有数价，哄抬市场，或杀价成交，小生产者受尽剥削。结果，盐场生产遭受到极大的破坏和束缚，工人大批失业，生产难以维持。针对这一情况，我们在一九五○年下半年开始了对私营盐业的社会主义改造。取缔了投机私商，成立了运水公司，统一收购和调配卤水。接着又成立了盐业公司，负责统一收购产盐，计划供应主要原材料。从此，自贡盐场就全部纳入了统购包销的国家资本主义中级形式。加上国家对盐场不断投资贷款扶持，一九五一年就有百分之八十左右的企业恢复了生产，工人大批就业，大小资本家也都得到了适当的利润。一九五一年初，政府接受资本家的要求，对生产几乎停闭的久大盐业公司实行了公私合营。
    自贡盐场的私营企业虽然实行了初步的改造，但由于大部分企业的生产关系还没有改变，生产仍处于分散落后状态，不能适应国家工业发展和人民生活日益增长着的需要。资本家也仍然采取各种投机取巧、唯利是图的办法进行经营。加上机构臃肿，管理混乱，严重地阻碍着井盐产量、质量的进一步提高和成本的降低，私营盐业维持生产遇到了很大的困难。
    一九五四年，一批资本家受到了国家过渡时期总任务的教育，看到了久大盐业公司公私合营后所获得的显著成就，认清了企业和个人的前途，要求公私合营。根据国家的需要和可能，我们对二十九家大型企业实行了公私合营，建立了公私合营建华制盐公司。在统筹兼顾全面规划的方针下，今年，我们采用以大带小、先进带落后的办法，把七十二个生产企业分别并入久大、建华两个公司，分期分批地实行了全行业的公私合营。现在，自贡盐场中十个职工以上的井灶企业，都已走上了国家资本主义的高级形式。至此，国营和公私合营盐业在全市盐产总值中的比重，已由一九五四年的百分之七十一点三一上升到了目前的百分之九十三点零二，社会主义经济成份已占据了绝对的优势。
    实现公私合营是一场极端尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争。资本家在清资估价中抬高成色，多估价格。有的甚至互相哄抬，或出卖积存的生产资料，企图抽逃资金。针对这些情况，我们反复对资本家进行了“公平合理，实事求是”的政策教育，并组织了若干清资估价专业小组，在公私双方共同参加下，协商了清资估价标准和深入现场典型试估，最后再复查定股。对于某些复杂的问题，我们还请专门人员参与和提出处理意见。由于工作细致，充分协商，私方都较满意。此外，我们对某些资本家的不法行为，也分别进行了严格批判；对表现较好的则加以表扬。
    在对实职人员的安排问题上的斗争也是很复杂的。其中有私人资本家和国家在企业中的代表争夺领导权的斗争，也有私人之间争地位的斗争。大、中、小资本家都有顾虑。大资本家怕当不上经理、科长，不愿同久大盐业公司合并；中、小资本家则徘徊观望，认为大资本家都不一定安上，自己还有什么希望，普遍反映：“当个办事员算了”。年老力弱的资本家，想搞个职位高、钱多、责任小的职务；有的又怕找不到事做。针对这一情况，我们先后召开了几次资本家座谈会，从正面交代政策，解除顾虑，反复说明量才录用的原则，由公方提出安排名单，同私方充分协商通过，最后请上级任命。认真安排的结果，五十五个资本家中，安排有副经理三人，科长一人，副科长四人，副主任十八人，其余都担任一般工作，对老弱的也予照顾。
    经过改组改造以后，自贡盐业的面貌已焕然一新。
    按照社会主义企业的管理原则，我们已逐步地把三十里范围内的一百多个小井小灶，组织成了两个大的公司。在这两个公司里，以地区为单位，以七、八个小井灶联合组成十七个大的车间。由于建立和健全了企业的管理机构，井盐的生产已从过去那种分散落后的手工业生产方式，变成了大生产。在这两个企业中，我们推行了计划管理，建立了财务制度，规定了各种定额，加强了技术管理。对某些陈旧的生产设备，进行了规模较大的整修改建。建华公司公私合营一年来，整修了七部锅炉，换了两部新锅炉，大检修了十四部吸卤卷扬机，扩建和改建了厂房，生产规模扩大了一倍。久大公司在四年前只有两口租营的卤井和三口平锅，职工一百五十七人，现在它已有卤井三十九眼，瓦斯井十四眼，炭花灶一百二十四口，职工三千五百四十九人，资产总值扩大了四倍多。此外，它还扩建了化工副产车间，生产着硼砂、硼酸、溴素、氯化钾等多种贵重产品。
    公私合营以后，广大职工群众更是欢欣鼓舞。许多人都把这当成自己生活中的一件大事。还在公私合营过程中，职工就纷纷提出：“搞好生产，迎接公私合营”的口号。力生第二厂烧盐工人王建章克服了产生废品的现象，积极帮助别人改进操作，提高产量。久大公司四年来职工们提出的合理化建议达一千八百五十九件，并推广和创造了筒内汲卤器、无浆制盐法等四大先进经验。只筒内汲卤器一项在十四个卤井推广后，产量就普遍提高了百分之十五以上。由于职工和技术人员提高了劳动热情，劳动生产率提高了百分之三十七点七五。建华公司去年下半年公私合营后，今年上半年卤的产量比去年同期提高了百分之三十二，盐产量提高了百分之二十八；废品率从百分之一点二三下降到一点零八，成本也比以前降低了百分之七点六一。
    随着生产的发展，职工的劳动条件和物质福利也大大改善了。这几年，新建的职工宿舍已达一万九千二百多平方公尺。过去，夏天工人们睡在竹板上，冬天团在篾包里。现在他们都高高兴兴地迁入了新居。过去工人在低矮闷热的灶房里工作，夏天炎热时，有些工人就昏倒过去。现在，厂房里不仅装上了较好的通风设备，像久大公司第二制盐处还装上了屋顶喷水器。在瓦斯灶房里，也都设置了排除二氧化硫气体的烟囱。由于医疗设施的改进，几年来职工的病伤率已降低了百分之五十九点零七。工资也在逐年增加着。
    实行公私合营以后，资本家的收入也增多了。以建华公司为例，合营初期，生产虽然还不正常，但资本家所获得的利润还是比私营时提高了百分之六点二五。今年一至十月，利润又比去年同期增加了一倍半。这些事实，使资本家深深体会到，走公私合营的道路，不仅对国家有利，对生产有利，对自己也是有利的。
    几年来，由于逐步加强对企业的和对资产阶级分子的改造，大部分资本家都能守职尽责。资方代理人毛学征，经过几年来改造教育转变较大，工作上有贡献，已争取参加了工会，成了工人阶级的一分子。毛学征的前途正是表明老老实实接受改造的资本家的光明道路。但是，并不是所有的资本家都已认识了这一点，现在仍有部分资本家并没有很好的接受改造。由于他们的唯利是图的阶级本质所决定，有的还在暗中同公股争夺领导权，散布资产阶级经营观点，挑拨离间，歪曲公私合营政策，只求利润，不顾国家利益及工人生命安全。这些事实说明，在公私合营企业内部的阶级斗争仍是尖锐的。我们必须继续加强对企业和资产阶级分子的改造，加强政治教育工作，逐步地将剥削者改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
