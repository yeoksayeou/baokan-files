Hubei Province recently convened its Fourth Provincial Forestry Conference, which studied the forestry production plan for the next two years and the long-term plan for forestry production during the second and third Five-Year Plans. The conference determined that the greening of the entire province would be completed within the next twelve years. In the next two years, the province will afforest 8.5 million mu. By 1957, the province's afforestation achievements will exceed the task stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan by more than double. During the Second Five-Year Plan, more than 45.5 million mu will be afforested, and the vast plain area with nearly 6 million agricultural population in the province will be completely greened. During the Third Five-Year Plan, more than 35.5 million mu will be afforested to complete the greening of hills and mountainous areas. By 1967, all the barren hills, wasteland, rivers, reservoirs, villages, and roads in the province will be greened. To meet the needs of river basin planning, soil and water conservation, and national construction, protection forests and timber forests will account for 80% of the total afforestation area in Hubei Province, mainly distributed in the Han River, Fu River, Qing River, and other river basins. Special economic forests will also be greatly developed, with camellia oleifera and tung oil trees, which account for a considerable proportion of the national output, covering an afforested area of about 10 million mu. Fruit trees and trees favored by local people will be given priority to planting alongside villages, highways, and reservoirs. Under the slogan of "Greening Barren Hills, Greening the Countryside," Hubei is preparing to rely on agricultural production cooperatives to carry out mass afforestation work. Agricultural production cooperatives in many areas have already included forestry planning as an important part of their production plans. The province will train 80,000 forestry workers for agricultural production cooperatives next year, and the state's technical guidance for forestry will also be strengthened accordingly.

    湖北省将在十二年内完成全省绿化工作湖北省最近召开的全省第四次林业会议，研究了今后两年的林业生产规划和第二、第三两个五年计划期间林业生产的远景计划。会议确定在今后十二年内完成全省的绿化工作。今后两年全省要造林八百五十万亩，到一九五七年，全省造林成绩将超过第一个五年计划规定任务一倍多；第二个五年计划期间要造林四千五百五十多万亩，全省近六百万农业人口的广大平原地区将全部绿化；第三个五年计划期间要造林三千五百五十多万亩，完成丘陵和山区的绿化工作。到一九六七年，全省的荒山、荒地、河流、水库、村落、道路都将绿化。适应流域规划、水土保持和国家建设的需要，湖北省造林总面积中，防护林和用材林将占百分之八十，它们主要分布在汉水、府河、清江等流域内。特种经济林也将有很大发展，产量在全国占相当比重的油茶和油桐，营林面积在一千万亩左右。在村庄、公路和水库的两旁和四周，将尽先种植果树和当地群众喜爱的树木。在“绿化荒山，绿化农村”的口号下，湖北各地正在准备依靠农业生产合作社开展群众性的造林工作。不少地区的农业生产合作社已经把林业规划列为生产规划的重要内容之一。全省明年将为农业生产合作社训练林业员八万人，国家对林业的技术指导力量也将相应加强。（袁军　刘国杜）
