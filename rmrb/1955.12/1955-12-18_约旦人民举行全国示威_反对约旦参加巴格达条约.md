Xinhua News Agency, Amman, December 17th: Demonstrations and strikes against Jordan's participation in the Baghdad Pact were held throughout Jordan on December 16th.

    The largest demonstrations took place in Amman, the Jordanian capital, and Nablus, Jordan's second largest city. In Amman, tens of thousands of people participated in the demonstrations. The Nablus demonstration was led by two former ministers and four members of parliament.

    These demonstrations followed closely after the activities of British Imperial Chief of Staff Templer in Jordan. Templer held talks with the Jordanian government in Amman in an attempt to force Jordan to join the Baghdad Pact.

    The National Socialist Party, Jordan's main opposition party, issued a statement opposing attempts to make Jordan join the Baghdad Pact against the wishes of the Arab people.

    According to Reuters, several thousand people were killed and injured by the army and police during the December 16th demonstrations. More than 300 people were arrested, including two members of parliament. A curfew has been declared throughout Jordan.
