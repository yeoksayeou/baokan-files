    Jilin New China Sugar Refinery Goes into Production
    The Jilin New China Sugar Refinery officially went into production on the 1st. This factory is the second modernized sugar refinery that the Polish government has helped our country build.
    After this large sugar refinery goes into production, Jilin Province's sugar production can be increased by more than double. During the production period from October to March of the following year, the New China Sugar Refinery can produce more than 20,000 tons of sugar. The profits from this factory's production in a few years will be equivalent to the entire investment in the factory's construction.
    This year, tens of thousands of farmers in Jilin Province have expanded the area for planting sugar beets according to the state's plan, supporting the production of the New China Sugar Refinery. It is expected that the sugar beet planting area in Jilin Province will be further expanded next year.

    吉林新中国制糖厂投入生产
    吉林省新中国制糖厂已在一日正式投入生产。这个厂是波兰政府帮助我国建设的第二个现代化的制糖厂。
    这座大型制糖厂投入生产后，吉林省的砂糖产量可以提高一倍以上。每年从十月到第二年三月的生产期间，新中国制糖厂可生产砂糖两万多吨。这个厂投入生产后，几年内的利润就相当于建厂的全部投资。
    今年，吉林省几万户农民已按照国家的计划，扩大了种植甜菜的面积，支援新中国制糖厂的生产。预计明年吉林省甜菜种植面积还要扩大。
