In the peak season of material supply in Hunan Province, the province organized more than 9,000 peddlers to go deep into the countryside to deliver goods to people's doors, which was very popular among farmers. Li Aiwu, a peddler from the Quantang Sales Outlet of the Shiwang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hengshan County, pre-arranged the delivery locations according to the supply scope and delivered the goods on time according to the agreed time with the masses. Whenever he delivered goods to the countryside, the regular supply point formed a small market. After delivering goods regularly at Zhetangpu, the number of people buying goods increased from dozens to more than 200 each time. The turnover expanded from more than ten yuan to more than two hundred yuan each time. When Liao Changyi, a peddler from the Changjiangting Sales Outlet of the Luoqiao District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Changning County, delivered goods to the countryside, he also contacted the township government and the Party branch in advance, reported his work to the Party branch, and obtained the help of the Party branch to understand the needs of the farmers in a timely manner. Once he learned that the farmers in Chatian Township were selling pigs and had money in their hands, he promptly delivered the goods to their doorsteps. As a result, in a small village of six households, he sold more than 30 yuan worth of goods at one time. (Our correspondent in Changsha)

    湖南组织大批货郎担下乡
    湖南省在旺季物资供应中，全省组织了九千多副货郎担深入农村，送货上门，很受农民欢迎。衡山县石湾区供销合作社泉塘分销店李爱吾的货郎担按照供应范围，预先排定轮流送货地点，按照与群众约好的时间，按时送货。每当他送货到乡的时候，那个定期供应点就形成一个小型墟场，在柘塘铺定期送货后，每次买货的人由几十人增加到二百多人。营业额由十多元扩大到每次二百多元。常宁县罗桥区供销合作社长江亭分销店廖常翼的货郎担送货下乡时，还事先同乡政府、党支部联系，向党支部汇报工作，取得了党支部的帮助，及时了解农民的需要。有一次他了解到茶田乡农民卖猪，手中有钱，便及时将货物送上门，结果在一个六户人家的小村子里，一次就卖了三十多元的货。（本报驻长沙记者）
