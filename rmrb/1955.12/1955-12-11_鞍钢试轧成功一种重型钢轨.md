    Anshan Iron and Steel Successfully Trials a Type of Heavy Steel Rail
    On November 30th, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Large Rolling Mill successfully trial-rolled a type of heavy steel rail according to the latest 1954 Soviet standards. This type of steel rail has particularly strong wear resistance, and the joints of the steel rail will not have flash or fall off. With the successful trial rolling of this new product, some lines in our country with particularly high transport volumes will be able to lay this type of steel rail next year, without needing to import it from foreign countries.

    鞍钢试轧成功一种重型钢轨
    鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂在十一月三十日，按照苏联一九五四年最新标准试轧成功一种重型钢轨。这种钢轨耐磨性特别强，钢轨接头的地方不会飞边和脱落。由于这种新产品的试轧成功，我国明年某些运输量特别大的线路将可铺设这种钢轨，不需要由外国进口了。
