    Beautiful Hungarian Photography Art
    Shi Shaohua
    The Hungarian Photography Art Exhibition at the Capital's Laboring People's Cultural Palace has been well received by the general public. The photographic works of the Hungarian People's Republic have long enjoyed a good reputation internationally. At the "International Photography Competition" held in Nuremberg in 1955, Hungarian works won the first, second, third, and fourth prizes.
    The exhibition, showcasing more than 260 works by 51 Hungarian photographers, clearly demonstrates the brilliant achievements of Hungarian photography art on the path of socialist realism since liberation. These works profoundly reflect various aspects of Hungarian social life, truthfully and specifically portraying Hungary's socialist construction, and the working people's love for work, life, and peace.
    There are many aspects of these excellent works that are worthy of study and learning. Here, I will only emphasize a few points:
    One of the advantages of Hungarian photography works is the novelty and vividness of their themes. Hungarian photography workers are very serious about selecting meaningful themes from life and are good at studying them, choosing content that is exciting and suitable for photographic art expression from their observations of and profound experiences in life. Take József Süyi's "Watering the 'Seedlings'" as an example: this photograph shows a mother and her lovely child playing on the lakeshore. The background of the photograph is the beautiful lakeshore. The mother is holding the child's toy—a watering can—and slowly pouring water on the child's head and body. The child shows a naive and happy smile, joyfully enjoying the warmth of maternal love. This work not only expresses love but also reflects the beautiful and happy lives of children in the new society. It also educates people that the new generation should be cared for and cultivated like gardeners care for seedlings, so that the seedlings grow strong, blossom, and bear fruit. Such works leave people with a deep and humane impression. Life is always rich and colorful. As long as photography workers can carefully study it and correctly understand it, then fresh and vivid themes are inexhaustible.
    This Hungarian photography art exhibition also demonstrates the serious and conscientious attitude of Hungarian photographers towards their work. They put a lot of effort into each work, diligently accumulating life knowledge, and being very meticulous and rigorous in the selection of themes, the use of light, the handling of composition, and even the developing of film and enlarging. This work style is worth learning from.
    At a symposium of Beijing's photography circles, Hungarian photographer Lev Miklós introduced the process of Bálint Feriencz's shooting of "Opening up the Underground Railway": Bálint Feriencz specializes in architectural photography and is a famous Hungarian architectural photographer. When he was shooting this photo, several other photographers participated in the work, and Lev Miklós was one of them. Their purpose in participating was to learn Bálint's experience in shooting architecture.
    In order to truthfully represent the scene of the underground railway under construction, in addition to carefully observing the situation on the spot, they also spent a lot of time studying how to use light to express the underground railway project and the people in a layered manner. After repeated observation and research, they decided to burn magnesium powder in three places simultaneously. The result of the shooting was good, and this work was also exhibited at this exhibition. But they finally summarized the experience and believed that if the angle of the lens had been handled more appropriately, then the effect of this photo would have been even better.
    This example tells us that Hungarian photography workers not only have proficient photography skills and a high level of artistic accomplishment but also have a serious work attitude and creative spirit. That is to say, when superb skills and rich knowledge are combined with creative labor, then the work will reach perfection.
    In the works exhibited this time, for example, the relatively fast-moving "Invitation Dance" (author: Farkas Tamás), the "Miser" (still photo, author: Gellért Éva) that expresses the character's emotions, and the still life photo "Pumpkin and Grapes" (author: Molnár Edit) are different types of photos. Some express fast movements, some express the inner world, and some express the state of stationary objects. However, these photos are very appropriate in their use of light, in their depiction of the characters' personalities, and in their choice of backgrounds, and they all have the common characteristics mentioned above.
    The achievements of Hungarian photography art are inseparable from the care of the country and the love of the people.
    The Hungarian People's Republic gives great care to photography art, encourages photographers to serve the people, and awards bonuses and certificates to outstanding photography workers. Hungary has built a considerable scale of photography industry. The Hungarian Pictorial, in its third issue of 1955, had the following introduction:
    "In Hungary, photography has become a common hobby. There is hardly an agency or factory that does not have a well-equipped photography club organization."
    With the care and support of the government and the people, Hungarian photography workers have correctly recognized the responsibility and significance of their work. For example, the famous Hungarian photographer Vadász Elemér, who has won more than 50 gold medals in "International Photography Competitions," is a good example. After the Hungarian people were liberated, Vadász Elemér saw the people living free and happy lives, and he himself was encouraged by the government, which made him even more actively engaged in creation and resolutely advance along the road of socialist realism, thus achieving brilliant achievements. Now, he has not only created many excellent works that are inspiring and educational but also actively cultivated a large number of young photography workers. Among the works in this exhibition, there are many works by new and young photographers. Now, the Hungarian national publishing institution is editing Vadász's works into an album, ready to be published in four languages.
    This Hungarian Photography Art Exhibition, through its rich content and beautiful form, has enabled the Chinese people to more specifically understand the work and life of the Hungarian people, and at the same time has brought many valuable experiences worthy of learning from to Chinese photography workers. This photography art exhibition has made a beneficial contribution to strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people and exchanging the cultures of China and Hungary.

    优美的匈牙利摄影艺术  
    石少华
    在首都劳动人民文化宫展出的匈牙利摄影艺术展览，受到了广大观众的欢迎。匈牙利人民共和国的摄影作品，在国际上是素负声誉的。一九五五年在纽伦堡举行的“国际摄影比赛会”上，匈牙利的作品就曾获得了第一、第二、第三和第四奖。
    展览会展出的五十一位匈牙利摄影家的二百六十多幅作品，清楚地显示出解放后匈牙利摄影艺术，在社会主义现实主义的创作道路上所获得的辉煌成就。这些作品深刻地反映了匈牙利社会生活的各个方面，真实而具体地表现了匈牙利的社会主义建设，劳动人民对工作、生活和和平的热爱。
    对于这些优秀的作品，值得研究和学习的地方是很多的，这里，我只着重地提出几点：
    题材的新颖、生动是匈牙利摄影作品的优点之一。匈牙利的摄影工作者非常认真地从生活中选择有意义的题材，而且善于研究题材，从自己对生活的观察和深刻的体验中，选择生活中精采的、适宜于摄影艺术表现的内容。举舒依·约瑟夫的“用水滋润‘幼苗’”这张作品做例子：这张照片表现一位母亲和自己可爱的孩子在湖滨玩耍，照片的背景是风光明媚的湖滨，母亲拿着孩子的玩具——浇花的喷壶，向孩子的头上和身上慢慢地浇着水，孩子流露着天真快乐的笑容，喜悦地享受着母爱的温暖。这幅作品不仅表现了爱，同时也反映了新社会里孩子们美好幸福的生活，它还教育人们，对新生的一代，应当像园丁对幼苗似的关怀和培植，使幼苗健壮地成长，开花结果。这样的作品给人们的印象是深刻的，富有人情味的。生活永远是丰富多采的，只要摄影工作者能够认真地研究它，正确地体会它，那末，新鲜生动的题材是取之不尽，用之不竭的。
    在这次匈牙利摄影艺术展览的作品中，同样也显示了匈牙利摄影家们对工作的严肃认真态度，他们对每幅作品都下了很大功夫，他们辛勤地积累生活知识，在题材取舍、光线运用、构图处理以至冲洗胶卷、放大方面也都非常细致和丝毫不苟，这种工作作风是值得我们学习的。
    匈牙利摄影家列夫·米柯罗斯在北京摄影界的座谈会上，曾介绍了巴尔达·费罗茨拍摄“开凿地下铁道”的经过：巴尔达·费罗茨擅长于建筑摄影，是匈牙利著名的建筑摄影家。当他拍摄这幅照片的时候，另外几位摄影家参加了这一工作，列夫·米柯罗斯也是其中的一位。他们参加的目的是学习巴尔达拍摄建筑的经验。
    为了把正在建筑中的地下铁道的场面真实地表现出来，他们除了认真地观察现场的情况外，还特别花了很多时间研究怎样用光才能把地下铁道的工程、人物有层次地表现出来，经过反复观察、研究以后，决定在三处地方同时燃烧镁光粉，结果拍摄的效果是良好的，这幅作品也在这次展览会上展出了。但他们最后总结了经验，认为这幅照片如果在镜头的角度上处理得更恰当些，那末，这幅照片的效果将会更好一些。
    这一例子告诉我们，匈牙利的摄影工作者不仅具有熟练的摄影技巧和高度的艺术修养，同时具有认真的工作态度和创造精神。这就是说，当精湛的技巧、丰富的知识结合了创造性的劳动以后，那就会使作品达到完美的地步。
    在这次展出的作品中，例如动作较快的“邀请舞”（作者：法尔卡斯·达马什）、表现人物感情的“守财奴”（剧照，作者：盖蕾迪·埃娃）和静物照片“南瓜和葡萄”（作者：蒙纳尔·埃狄特）等作品，是不同类型的照片，有的表现快动作，有的表现内心世界，有的表现静止物体的状态，但这些照片在用光上，在刻划人物的性格和选择背景上，都是很恰当的，都具有以上所说的共同特点。
    匈牙利摄影艺术的成就，是同国家的关怀以及全国人民的热爱分不开的。
  　匈牙利人民共和国给予摄影艺术极大的关怀，鼓励摄影家为人民服务，对优秀的摄影工作者发给奖金、奖状，匈牙利建设了相当规模的摄影工业。广大的劳动人民对摄影艺术极为爱好。匈牙利画报一九五五年第三期里，曾有这样的介绍：
    “在匈牙利，摄影已经成为普遍的嗜好。几乎没有一个机关、工厂没有拥有良好装备的摄影俱乐部的组织。”
    在政府和人民的关心和支持下，匈牙利的摄影工作者正确认识了自己工作的责任和意义。例如曾经获得过五十多枚“国际摄影比赛”金牌奖的匈牙利著名摄影家瓦达什·埃罗纳就是一个很好的例证。匈牙利人民获得解放以后，瓦达什·埃罗纳见到了人民过着自由幸福的生活，他自己并得到政府的鼓励，这使他更加积极地进行创作，坚决地沿着社会主义现实主义的道路前进，因此获得了光辉的成就。现在他不仅创作了很多优秀的、富有鼓舞和教育意义的作品，而且积极地培养了大批的青年摄影工作者。在这次展览的作品中，就有不少新的、年青的摄影家的作品。现在，匈牙利国家出版机构正在将瓦达什的作品编辑成画册，准备用四国文字出版。
    这次匈牙利摄影艺术展览，通过丰富的内容、优美的形式，使中国人民更具体地了解了匈牙利人民的工作和生活，同时还给中国的摄影工作者带来了许多宝贵的、值得学习的经验。这次摄影艺术展览，对于加强中、匈人民之间的友谊，交流中、匈两国的文化，做了有益的贡献。
