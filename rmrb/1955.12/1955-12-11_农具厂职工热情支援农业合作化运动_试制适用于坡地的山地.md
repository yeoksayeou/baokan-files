    Farm Implement Factory Workers Enthusiastically Support the Agricultural Cooperativization Movement
    Trial-Producing Mountain Land Suitable for Slopes
    Editor:
    In recent years, farmers in various parts of Rehe Province have urgently requested farm implements suitable for slopes. In order to meet the needs of farmers, our Chifeng Farm Implement Factory found samples of mountain plows from the Northwest and other places in the summer of 1954 for trial production. After several field tests and extensive consultation with farmers, we revised the design according to Soviet standards and carried out trial production again in September this year. Recently, ten trial-produced reversible plows (mountain plows) have been distributed to various parts of the province for field trials, and the results have been warmly welcomed by the farmers participating in the trials.
    When the mountain plow was tested in Gongyefu (the seat of the banner) in the Kalaqin Banner, the banner was holding a "Three Fixes" meeting, so hundreds of people participated in the trial. They were all satisfied with the test results. Some people said with emotion, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, mountain land can also use new farm implements!" When it was tested in the tenth district of Chifeng County, a farmer holding the plow said, "This plow is really easy to use. It took me less than twenty minutes to learn how to use it!" While testing in various parts of the province, many farmers wanted to order goods, and some even wanted to buy the test products.
    We are determined to continue to improve this mountain plow based on the results of this test and the opinions of the higher-level leading organs, and prepare to produce it in large quantities in the future to support our farmer brothers!

    Increasing Production of New Farm Implements Such as Double-Wheel Double-Share Plows
    Editor:
    The good news of the harvest and the victory of agricultural cooperativization are inspiring us. We are determined to produce more, better, and cheaper new farm implements to support our farmer brothers.
    These days, our factory workers have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, making the production show a new atmosphere. The Zhang Huaji group in the third workshop improved the "two-time ? bent nail tooth die", and the work that originally required four people can now be overfulfilled by two people. The daily output of double-wheel double-share plows in the general assembly section of the fifth workshop was 100 units in September, and it has averaged 167 units in November. The Qi Fenglin group in the fourth workshop improved the "wheel axle auxiliary strip" operation method, changing from single-knife to double-knife, and the daily output increased from 600 to 2,200. Li Yanlai (provincial industrial labor model), the section chief of the batching section in the second workshop, actively led the workers in the entire section to adopt reasonable material nesting and try to use edge materials as much as possible, saving the country 35 tons of steel in the two months of October and November.
    In order to meet the needs of our farmer brothers, we guarantee to increase the production of 1,500 double-wheel double-share plows, 3,000 shovel cultivators, 150 seeders, and 200 sets of nail-tooth harrows this year. We earnestly hope that our farmer brothers will tell us their needs and opinions on the products to help us improve production.

    Efforts to Reduce the Cost of Farm Implements
    Editor:
    The workers of the Local State-Owned Lanxi Iron Factory in Zhejiang are actively putting forward rationalization proposals and promoting advanced experience in order to reduce the cost of farm implements. They have promoted the "subcontracting" assembly line operation method, which greatly shortens the quota working hours. Young workers Shen Yunxing and Zhan Naikun improved the iron mold, which tripled the work efficiency of turning corn thresher tooth plates; originally, each person could only make eight corn threshers per day, but now they can make eighteen, and the scrap rate has also dropped from 20% to less than 8%. Workers Lu Jiansen, Xu Youlin, and others improved the lathe tool press plate, which improved the efficiency of the "long screw" of the reservoir gate hoist and the efficiency of correcting the steel shaft. The above-mentioned improvements in operating methods and production tools have improved production efficiency, and the cost of farm implements has therefore been reduced. In the past, a corn thresher cost ten yuan, seven jiao, and five fen, but now it only costs nine yuan and two jiao.

    农具厂职工热情支援农业合作化运动
    试制适用于坡地的山地编辑同志：
    几年来，热河省各地农民迫切要求有适用于坡地的农具。我们赤峰农具厂为了满足农民的需要，在一九五四年夏天就从西北等地找到了山地犁的实样进行试制。经过了几次田间试验和广泛征求农民兄弟的意见以后，我们在今年九月又根据苏联标准修改了设计和重新进行试制。最近，试制出的十台反转犁（山地犁）已经分发到省内各地作田间试验，结果受到参加试验的农民的热烈欢迎。
    山地犁在喀喇沁旗公爷府（旗所在地）试验的时候，旗里正召开“三定”会议，因此有好几百人参加试验。他们对试验结果都很满意。有人还感动地说：“在毛主席领导下，山地也能使用新式农具啦！”在赤峰县十区试验的时候，一个扶犁的农民说：“这种犁真好使，不到二十分钟，我就学会使用啦！”在省内各地试验的同时，很多农民就要订货，有的还要把试验品买去。
    我们决心根据这次试验结果和上级领导机关的意见继续改进这种山地犁，准备在今后大量生产，来支援农民弟兄！
    热河省地方国营赤峰农具厂
    增产双轮双铧犁等新农具编辑同志：
    丰收的喜讯和农业合作化的胜利鼓舞着我们。我们决心生产更多、更好、更便宜的新农具来支援农民弟兄们。
    这些日子里，我们全厂工人发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，使生产出现了一片新气象。三车间张化吉小组改进了“两次?弯钉齿胎具”，原来四个人的工作现在两个人就可以超额完成。五车间总装配工段双轮双铧犁配组九月份的日产量是一百台，十一月份已经平均达到一百六十七台。四车间齐凤林小组改进了“轮轴辅条”操作法，由单刀改为双刀，日产量从六百个上升到两千二百个。二车间配料工段段长李延来（省工业劳动模范）积极带动全段职工采用合理套料和尽量利用边料的方法，在十月和十一月两个月中就给国家节省了三十五吨钢材。
    为了满足农民兄弟的需要，我们保证今年增产双轮双铧犁一千五百台，铲趟机三千台，播种机一百五十台，钉齿耙二百组。我们恳切地希望农民弟兄们把他们的需要和对产品的意见告诉我们，帮助我们改进生产。
                      吉林省农具厂全体职工
    努力降低农具成本编辑同志：
    地方国营浙江兰溪铁工厂的工人们，为了降低农具成本，积极提出合理化建议和推广先进经验。他们推行了“分工包干”流水作业法，大大缩短了定额工时。青年工人沈允兴和詹乃坤改进了铁模子，使翻制玉米脱粒机齿盆的工作效率提高了三倍；原来每人每天只能做八台玉米脱粒机，现在就能做十八台了，废品率也由百分之二十降低到百分之八以下。工人陆鉴森、徐有林等改进了车刀压板，提高了车水库闸板启闭机“长螺丝”的效率和校正钢轴的效率。上述操作方法和生产工具的改进，使生产效率得到提高，农具成本因而降低。过去一台玉米脱粒机要卖十元零七角五分，现在只要九元二角了。
