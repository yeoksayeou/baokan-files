Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 14th. The full text of the Soviet-Indian Joint Communiqué on Economic Relations between India and the Soviet Union is as follows:

    The joint statement of N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.S. Khrushchev, member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, pointed out the desire of the two countries to develop economic cooperation and expand trade relations. To this end, representatives of the Soviet and Indian governments held preliminary talks and reached an understanding that it would be beneficial to both sides to increase the total volume of trade between the two countries to the maximum possible extent. As a first step in this direction, the following agreements were also reached:

    1.  (A) In the three years beginning in 1956, the Soviet Union will provide, and India will purchase, one million tons of steel, of which 300,000 tons will be in the first year and 350,000 tons in each of the following two years. The dates and conditions of delivery will be negotiated and agreed upon in the future.

    (B) During these three years, according to future agreements between the two parties, the Soviet Union will also sell, and India will purchase, oil exploration equipment, mining industry equipment, and other equipment, as well as other commodities. The delivery dates and transaction conditions of these commodities and equipment will be negotiated and agreed upon in future negotiations.

    (C) The Soviet Union will greatly increase the quantity of raw materials and industrial products purchased from India. The conditions and dates will be negotiated and decided by the buying and selling parties. It is hoped that the total value of purchases, including the expenses required to maintain the official Soviet institutions in India, will be equal to the total value of India's purchases in the Soviet Union.

    (D) As stipulated in the Soviet-Indian Trade Agreement, the two governments will provide the maximum possible convenience for the import and export of the aforementioned commodities within the scope permitted by the relevant laws, rules, and regulations, and will make every effort to promote them.

    2.  In view of the increase in trade volume and to ensure corresponding conditions for maritime transportation of goods, the two governments believe that it is necessary to open shipping routes between the ports of the Soviet Union and India and to utilize Soviet and Indian ships.

    3.  The representatives of the two governments also agreed to dispatch delegations from the Soviet Union to India or from India to the Soviet Union within the shortest possible time permitted by actual circumstances to discuss the conditions and conclude agreements in order to implement the aforementioned agreements.

    苏联和印度经济关系联合公报
    新华社新德里十四日电　苏联—印度关于印度和苏联经济关系的联合公报，全文如下：
    苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和印度总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁的联合声明指出了两国对发展经济合作和扩大贸易关系的愿望。为此，苏联政府和印度政府双方代表进行了初步的会谈，并且取得谅解，认为两国增加贸易总额到最大的可能限度，对双方都是有利的。作为这方面的第一个步骤，还达成了下列协议：
    一、（甲）在从一九五六年开始的以后三年中，苏联将提供，而印度将购买一百万吨钢材，其中第一年为三十万吨，以后两年每年为三十五万吨。提供的日期和条件待今后谈判商定。
    （乙）在这三年中，按照双方今后的协议，苏联还将出卖，而印度将购买开采石油的设备、采矿工业设备和其他设备，以及其他商品。这些商品和设备的交货日期和交易条件将在今后的谈判中商定。
    （丙）苏联将大大增加购买印度的原料和工业品的数量，条件和日期将由购买和出卖双方协商决定。希望购货总值，包括维持苏联在印度的官方机构所需的费用在内，将同印度在苏联购货的总值相等。
    （丁）正如苏印贸易协定所规定的，两国政府对上述商品的进出口将在有关的法律、规则和条例所允许的范围内给予最大限度的方便，并且将全力加以促进。
    二、鉴于贸易量将要增加，以及为了保障海道运输商品的相应条件，两国政府认为有必要在苏联和印度两国港口之间开辟航线，并且利用苏联和印度的船只。
    三、两国政府代表也同意在实际情况允许的最短时期内派遣代表团从苏联到印度或者从印度到苏联商讨条件和缔结协定，以便实现上述协议。
                    一九五五年十二月十三日
                                  于新德里
