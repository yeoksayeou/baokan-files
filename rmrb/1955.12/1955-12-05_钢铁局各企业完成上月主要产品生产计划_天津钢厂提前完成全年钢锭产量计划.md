    Steel Bureau Enterprises Complete Last Month's Main Product Production Plan
    Tianjin Steel Plant Completes Annual Steel Ingot Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    (Our newspaper reports) The enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Steel Industry Administration Bureau overfulfilled the state production plan for five major products in November. Among them, iron ore completed 110.4 percent of the plan, metallurgical coke completed 100.8 percent of the plan, pig iron completed 102.2 percent of the plan, steel completed 106.8 percent of the plan, and steel材 (steel products/rolled steel) completed 102.8 percent of the plan.
    In November, after the open hearth production units of various enterprises learned the advanced quick steelmaking operation method of the young steelmaker Kolesnikov, who won the title of "Best Steel Worker of the Country" in the Soviet Union, the open hearth smelting time was generally shortened by more than 3 percent compared with the original plan. Some units even shortened it by more than 6 percent compared with the original plan, which increased a large number of steel ingots for the country. In terms of blast furnaces, the blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant strengthened raw material management and improved the charging method. The utilization coefficient reached 0.743, which was 3.39 percent lower than the previous highest record. After No. 2 blast furnace of Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant implemented the flat laying and direct extraction of raw materials, the average daily output in November increased by 4.9 percent compared with the past.
    As of the end of November, many enterprises under the Steel Industry Administration Bureau had completed the annual production plans for products such as pig iron, steel, and steel材 ahead of schedule. For example, the pig iron of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the steel of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant and Kunming Iron and Steel Plant, and the steel材 of Xinhu Steel Plant, Kunming Iron and Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant and Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant all completed the annual state production plan more than one month in advance.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th of this month: The steelmaking workers of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant have completed the annual steel ingot production plan ahead of schedule. The quality is also fully in line with the standards stipulated by the state. They will also increase the production of more than 8,000 tons of steel for the country this year.
    This year, the steelmaking workers of this plant promoted the advanced Soviet experience in steelmaking and furnace repair, which greatly improved the effective production time of the open hearth furnace. The output per square meter of furnace bottom area increased by 14 percent compared with last year. In November, after the steelmakers learned the advanced quick steelmaking operation method of Kolesnikov, the "Best Steel Worker of the Country" in the Soviet Union, the average smelting time per furnace of steel was shortened by 25 minutes compared with the past.

    钢铁局各企业完成上月主要产品生产计划
    天津钢厂提前完成全年钢锭产量计划
    本报讯　重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业超额完成了十一月份五种主要产品的国家生产计划。其中铁矿石完成计划百分之一百一十点四，冶金焦完成计划百分之一百点八，生铁完成计划百分之一百零二点二，钢完成计划百分之一百零六点八，钢材完成计划百分之一百零二点八。
    十一月份，各企业平炉生产单位在学习了曾经荣获苏联“国家最好的钢铁工人”称号的青年炼钢工人科列斯尼科夫的先进快速炼钢操作法以后，平炉熔炼时间一般都比原计划缩短了百分之三以上，有些单位还比原计划缩短了百分之六以上，给国家增产了大量的钢锭。在高炉方面，马鞍山炼铁厂高炉由于加强了原料管理，改进了上料方法，利用系数达到零点七四三，比过去最高纪录降低了百分之三点三九，重庆第一钢铁厂二号高炉执行了原料平铺直取以后，十一月份平均日产量比过去提高了百分之四点九。
    到十一月底为止，钢铁工业管理局已经有不少企业提前完成了生铁、钢和钢材等产品的全年生产计划。例如石景山钢铁厂的生铁，上海钢铁三厂、重庆第三钢铁厂和昆明钢铁厂的钢，新沪钢铁厂、昆明钢铁厂、唐山钢厂和重庆第三钢铁厂的钢材等都提前一个月以上完成了全年国家生产计划。
    新华社天津四日电　国营天津钢厂的炼钢工人提前完成了全年钢锭产量计划。质量也完全合乎国家规定的标准。年内他们还将为国家增产八千多吨钢。
    今年，这个厂的炼钢工人推行了苏联的炼钢和修炉先进经验，大大提高了平炉的有效生产时间。每平方公尺炉底面积的产量比去年提高了百分之十四。十一月间，炼钢工人们学习了苏联“国家最好的钢铁工人”科列斯尼科夫的快速炼钢先进操作方法以后，平均每炉钢的冶炼时间比过去缩短了二十五分钟。
