    Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Achievements of Soviet Workers in Production This Year
    On the eve of the New Year of 1956, the Soviet working people proudly reviewed their production achievements over the past year.
    As a result of the selfless labor of Ukrainian workers throughout the year, the level of industrial production in Ukraine in 1955 increased by more than 88 percent compared to 1950. In addition to a significant increase in the production of steel, iron, and electricity, many powerful water turbines, internal combustion locomotives, and coal mining combines were also produced. The pride of the Ukrainians, the Kakhovka Hydropower Station, after starting to generate electricity in mid-October, a year ahead of schedule, has recently achieved a new labor victory: the third unit has also started generating electricity ahead of schedule.
    Workers in Belarus have achieved particularly great achievements in machinery manufacturing this year. The machines produced in Belarus this year have reached 26 times that of 1940. The Minsk and Vitebsk machine building factories have mastered the production of about 100 new types of machine tools this year alone.
    The vanguard of Azerbaijani heavy industry workers, the oil workers, discovered many new oil deposits with abundant reserves this year, both on land and at sea. Oil production has increased significantly compared to last year.
    Workers in Uzbekistan, one of the main cotton-producing areas of the Soviet Union, have mastered the production of many new technological equipment this year. New agricultural technologies have been widely adopted in collective farms and state farms in Uzbekistan, and the average cotton harvest of many collective farms has increased by more than 30 percent per hectare.
    The working people of Kyrgyzstan call this year a glorious year. The daily production of Kyrgyzstan's large-scale industry is now equal to the production of the entire year of 1913.
    In the Baltic region, the Republic of Lithuania has experienced particularly vigorous industrial development this year. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, industrial output increased by an average of 20.9 percent annually. The great labor achievement of the Estonian working people this year is the start of electricity generation at the Narva Hydroelectric Power Station at the end of September, and the establishment of a new industrial sector - construction machinery manufacturing. Latvian workers completed the annual plan by 108 percent this year, mastering the production of 200 new types of machinery. Laboring farmers also sold much edible oil, milk and meat to the state in excess of the plan.
  Korea's Railway Infrastructure Construction Achieves Great Success
    The staff of the transportation industry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea brilliantly completed this year's large-scale transportation plan on December 26. The total amount of railway transportation increased by 41.5 percent compared to last year. Passenger transport increased by 34.4 percent compared to last year.
    In terms of basic railway construction, the Chongju Railway Station has been newly built in the past period. With the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other friendly countries, many railway buildings have been restored, improved, and expanded. In the past year, thanks to the fearless labor of the Chinese People's Volunteers, locomotive depots with new equipment have been built in West Pyongyang, Chongju, and Kowon. With the assistance of the Soviet people, the electrified railway line between Yangdok and Chonsong has been restored. With the direct economic and technical assistance of the Polish people, the restoration and expansion plan of the railway factories in West Pyongyang and Wonsan has also been successfully completed.
    International transportation work has also become active. The international train service between Pyongyang and Moscow began on April 20, and the number of railway stations handling international train passenger and freight transport has also increased.
  People's Lives in Northern Vietnam are Improving Day by Day
    The living conditions of the working people in Northern Vietnam have gradually improved under the care of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam over the past year.
    By the end of October this year, nearly 70,000 unemployed people abandoned by the French side had found jobs in various construction sites, mines, factories, and public institutions. The government has also implemented a new salary system aimed at encouraging workers to increase productivity.
    In Haiphong, a hospital built for the working people and a residential area capable of accommodating 100 families have been completed. Another residential area is under construction.
    The spiritual life of the workers has also been given due attention. Factories and public institutions have set up regular mass education classes, enabling nearly 10,000 workers to become literate. Each factory and public institution has established clubs and reading rooms, and organized sports groups.
  Poland's Shipbuilding Industry Has Made Great Development
    In 1955, the total displacement of ships built and launched by the Polish shipbuilding industry has increased to about 20 times that of 1949 before the start of the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955). The total displacement of ships launched in 1949 was 5,100 tons, and this year it reached 100,310 tons.
    Poland's shipbuilding industry is a new industrial sector established after liberation. Before the war, Poland only had a small ship repair yard in Gdansk. Now, People's Poland has five large-scale shipyards in Gdansk, Gdynia, and other seaports. These shipyards were built or rebuilt during the Six-Year Plan, and they can produce more than a dozen different types of ships. Currently, there are 40 ocean-going vessels under construction.
    With the development of the shipbuilding industry and foreign trade, the total displacement of Poland's merchant ships has now increased to five times that of before the war, and its merchant ships sail almost on all the oceans of the world.
  Many Enterprises in Czechoslovakia Completed This Year's Plan Ahead of Schedule
    In welcoming the New Year of 1956, many sectors of the national economy of Czechoslovakia have successively reported the news of completing the 1955 plan ahead of schedule.
    Czechoslovakia's coal mining, chemical, forestry and timber, and food industries, the railway system, and the retail trade system have all successfully completed the 1955 plan ahead of schedule. This year, the national procurement plans for grain, meat, and sugar beet have also been completed ahead of schedule.
  Great Achievements in Economic Construction of the German Democratic Republic
    In 1955, the German Democratic Republic achieved great achievements in strengthening its economic strength and laying the foundation for socialism.
    According to preliminary materials, the industrial production of the German Democratic Republic has overfulfilled the 1955 national economic plan. In the first eleven months of 1955, the total industrial output increased by 9.1 percent compared to the same period in 1954, of which the output of heavy industry increased by 9.3 percent, and the output of total machinery manufacturing increased by 14.6 percent.
    Since the founding of the German Democratic Republic, electricity production has increased by 75 percent, cement has increased by 50 percent, steel production has increased to more than four times, steel products have increased to more than five times, agricultural machinery has increased to more than four times, and cotton textiles have increased to nearly ten times.
    Great achievements have also been made in the development of agriculture and the socialist transformation of agriculture. By the end of this year, the land cultivated by agricultural production cooperatives accounted for more than 20 percent of the national arable land.
    The primary consideration of the government of the German Democratic Republic is to care for the further rise in the living standards of the working people. The reduction of retail prices alone has increased the income of residents by 13 billion marks in recent years.
    Romania's Oil Production Exceeds 10 Million Tons This Year
    The Romanian oil industry completed the production tasks of the first Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) five months ahead of schedule. This year, the national oil production has reached 10.56 million tons, which is more than double that of 1950. People's Romania has drilled more oil wells in less than five years than were drilled in the 35 years of capitalist rule. Workers have greatly shortened the drilling time due to the widespread adoption of advanced turbine drilling methods. For example, in Moldova, it used to take 60 months to drill an oil well, but now it takes less than a month. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联劳动人民一年来生产成就
    在一九五六年新年前夕，苏联劳动人民怀着自豪的心情回顾一年来的生产成绩。
    乌克兰工人一年来忘我劳动的结果，使乌克兰一九五五年工业生产水平比一九五零年增加了百分之八十八以上。除了钢、铁、电力的生产大大增加外，还生产了许多强大的水轮机、内燃机车和采煤联合机等产品。乌克兰人的骄傲——卡霍夫卡水电站，自从十月中旬提前一年开始发电以后，最近又获得新的劳动胜利：第三台联动机又提前发电了。
    白俄罗斯的工人今年在机器制造上获得了特别巨大的成就。今年白俄罗斯生产的机器已经达到一九四零年的二十六倍，明斯克和维切布斯克机器制造厂在今年一年中就掌握了约一百种新式机床的生产。
    阿塞拜疆重工业工人的先锋队——石油工人，今年在陆地上和海底发现了许多新的蕴藏量很丰富的石油矿。采油量比去年大大增加了。
    苏联主要产棉区之一乌兹别克的工人今年掌握了许多新技术设备的生产。乌兹别克集体农庄和国营农场大规模地采用了新的农业技术，很多集体农庄的棉花收获量平均每公顷增加了百分之三以上。
    吉尔吉斯劳动人民称呼今年为光辉的一年。吉尔吉斯大工业现在一天的生产量就等于一九一三年一年的生产量。
    在波罗的海地区，立陶宛共和国今年的工业有特别蓬勃的发展。在第五个五年计划期间，工业产量平均每年递增百分之二十点九。爱沙尼亚劳动人民今年巨大的劳动成就是纳瓦水电站在九月底开始发电，和一个新的工业部门——建筑机器制造业的建立。拉脱维亚工人今年完成了年度计划百分之一百零八，掌握了两百种新型机械的生产。劳动农民也超计划交售给国家许多食油、牛奶和肉类等。
  朝鲜铁路基本建设有很大成就
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国运输业的工作人员在十二月二十六日杰出地完成了今年的大规模运输计划。铁路运输的总额比去年增加了百分之四十一点五。客运比去年增加了百分之三十四点四。
    在铁路的基本建设方面，在过去一个时期中新建成了定州火车站。在苏联、中国和其他友好国家的兄弟般的帮助下，许多铁路建筑物恢复了，改进了和扩大了。在过去一年中，由于中国人民志愿军的奋不顾身的劳动，西平壤、定州和高原的有新型设备的机车场已经建成。在苏联人民的援助下，阳德和泉城之间的电气铁路线恢复了。在波兰人民的直接的经济和技术援助下，西平壤和元山的铁路工厂的恢复和扩建计划也已经胜利完成。
    国际运输工作也变得活跃了。平壤和莫斯科之间的国际火车联运在四月二十日开始，处理国际火车客运和货运的火车站的数目也有增加。
  越南北方人民生活一天天改善
    越南北方劳动人民的生活条件过去一年在越南民主共和国政府的关怀下已经逐渐得到改善。
    到今年十月底为止，被法方遗弃的近七万名失业的人已经在各个建筑工地、矿山、工厂和公共机关中找到了职业。政府并且已经实行了以鼓励工人提高生产率为目的的新的薪金制。
    在海防，为劳动人民建筑的一个医院和能够容纳一百个家庭的住宅区已经完工。另一个住宅区正在建筑中。
    工人的精神生活也受到了适当的照顾。工厂和公共机关都开办了正规的群众教育班，使得近一万名工人认识了字。每个工厂和公共机关都设立了俱乐部和阅览室，并且组织了体育小组。
  波兰的造船工业有巨大发展
      一九五五年，波兰造船工业制成下水的船只的总排水量，已经增加到六年计划（一九五○—一九五五年）开始前一九四九年的二十倍左右。一九四九年下水船只的总排水量是五千一百吨，今年达到了十万零三千一百吨。
    波兰的造船工业是在解放以后建立的新的工业部门，战前，波兰只在革但斯克有一个小型的船舶修理厂。现在，人民波兰在革但斯克、琴尼亚等海港共有五个大规模的造船厂。这些造船厂都是六年计划期间兴建或改建的，它们能生产十多种不同类型的船只。目前正在制造的有四十只航海船只。
    随着造船工业和对外贸易的发展，波兰目前商船的总排水量已经增加到战前的五倍，它的商船几乎航行在全球的各个海洋上。
  捷许多企业提前完成今年计划
    在迎接一九五六年新年的时候，捷克斯洛伐克的许多国民经济部门纷纷传来提前完成一九五五年计划的消息。
    捷克斯洛伐克的煤矿、化学、森林和木材、食品四个工业部门，铁路系统和零售贸易系统都胜利地提前完成了一九五五年计划。今年，全国谷物、肉类和甜菜的采购计划也提前完成了。
  民主德国经济建设的巨大成就
    一九五五年，德意志民主共和国在加强经济力量和奠定社会主义的基础方面取得了巨大成就。
    根据初步材料，德意志民主共和国的工业生产已经超额完成了一九五五年的国家经济计划。在一九五五年头十一个月中，工业总产量比一九五四年同时期增加了百分之九点一，其中重工业的产量增加了百分之九点三，总的机器制造业的产量增加了百分之十四点六。
    自从德意志民主共和国建国以来，电力生产增加了百分之七十五，水泥增加了百分之五十，钢产量增加到四倍多，钢材增加到五倍多，农业机器增加到四倍多，棉织品增加到将近十倍。
    在发展农业和农业社会主义改造方面，也取得了巨大的成就。到今年年底，农业生产合作社耕种的土地占全国可耕土地百分之二十以上。
    德意志民主共和国政府的首要考虑是关心劳动人民生活水平的进一步上升。光是零售价格的降低就已经在最近几年中使居民的收入增加了一百三十亿马克。
    罗今年石油产量超过一千万吨
    罗马尼亚石油工业提前五个月完成了第一个五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）的生产任务。今年全国石油的开采量已经达到了一千零五十六万吨，即增为一九五零年的两倍以上。人民罗马尼亚在过去不到五年的时间内钻探的油井，比资本家统治时期三十五年钻探的还要多。工人们由于广泛地采用了先进的涡轮钻井法，钻井的时间大大地缩短了。例如，在摩尔多瓦，过去钻一口油井需要六十个月，现在用不到一个月就行了。（据新华社讯）
