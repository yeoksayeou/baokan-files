Fair and Reasonable Handling of Means of Production Other Than Land
He Cheng

The most important means of production for farmers, apart from land, are draught animals, farm tools, carts, boats, and also trees, livestock, sideline tools, and so on. When farmers join a cooperative, they are also very concerned about how the cooperative handles these things. Some farmers are hesitant to join because they worry that the cooperative will not handle these things to their liking. Now, the draft model charter for agricultural production cooperatives has relatively detailed provisions for handling these things, and handling them according to these principles will satisfy all the members.

Which Things Should the Cooperative Unify for Use

Are all these things of the members, like land, necessarily handed over to the cooperative for unified use and unified management? Not entirely. Whether these things are to be unified for use and unified management by the cooperative depends on whether the cooperative needs them.

These main means of production fall into three categories:

The first category is indispensable for agricultural production, namely draught animals (horses, cattle, mules, donkeys, etc. used for cultivation), large farm tools (plows, new-style plows, horse-drawn farm tools, waterwheels, windmills, water pumps, etc.), and agricultural transportation tools (carts, boats, etc.). This category of things should be given priority for unified use by the cooperative.

The second category is closely related to agricultural production, namely contiguous trees, herds of livestock, etc. This category of things should generally be unified for management by the cooperative step by step.

The third category is less closely related to agriculture, namely large sideline tools and sideline equipment. Only a portion of this category of things needs to be unified for use by the cooperative.

Those that are not the main means of production are not unified for use and management. Small farm tools such as sickles and hoes are to be prepared and repaired by the members themselves; scattered trees belong to the members themselves and are managed by themselves; livestock and poultry belong to the members themselves and are managed by themselves; the means of production and equipment for sidelines suitable for family management should also belong to the members themselves. Even when the elementary cooperative is transformed into an advanced cooperative, these things are not to be made public.

Those main means of production that the cooperative needs can, with the consent of the owner, be made public step by step in batches and phases according to the needs of the cooperative, the strength of the cooperative, and other conditions. Before they are made public, when the cooperative unifies their use and management, the cooperative should give the owner appropriate remuneration; when they are made public, the cooperative should give the owner a fair price.

How to Remunerate Things That are Privately Owned and Publicly Used

How does the cooperative remunerate the main means of production that are privately owned and publicly used? For land remuneration, under certain circumstances, it is still possible to temporarily pay remuneration according to a certain percentage of the total agricultural income of the cooperative; the remuneration for means of production other than land cannot be adopted using this method. Generally speaking, draught animals, large farm tools, carts, boats, sideline tools, etc. are paid for by rent (this money is taken from production expenses when distributing income); for trees and livestock, other methods should be adopted.

Let's take draught animals as an example first. Farmers are particularly concerned about their own draught animals. "One head of cattle is half of the family's wealth." Many people treat their beloved livestock almost as a member of the family, and they have deep feelings for these animals. They cherish their livestock and are even reluctant to part with it. When the cooperative is first established, it generally lacks places to feed many livestock and lacks experience in collective livestock raising. Therefore, the draft model charter stipulates that generally, newly established cooperatives can temporarily adopt the method of private ownership, private raising, and public use of draught animals; the cooperative pays the owner remuneration by way of rent. The rent should be equivalent to the normal local rent. If the rent is too low, the owner will feel that they are at a disadvantage; if the rent is too high, just two or three years of rent will be enough to buy the same livestock, which is not beneficial to all the members of the cooperative, especially those with few livestock. Draught animals that are privately owned and publicly used should of course be given priority for use by the cooperative; when the cooperative does not need them, the owner can use them themselves, or lend them to others, or rent them to others. However, if you want to sell these draught animals, you must get the consent of the cooperative. If the cooperative uses these draught animals and they die or become disabled due to poor care, the owner should be given appropriate compensation. If the owner himself carelessly raises them badly, then of course the owner himself is responsible. How to handle the fertilizer accumulated from raising draught animals using this method? It can be determined by negotiating according to local customs for renting draught animals. Generally speaking, the fertilizer still belongs to the owner, but if the cooperative wants to buy it, it must first sell it to the cooperative. What happens when a female animal gives birth to a small animal? The small animal should belong to the owner, but the cooperative should pay less rent according to the reduced time of using the female animal.

Some members' families have semi-laborers, and it is convenient to raise draught animals in their own homes; some members' families do not have semi-laborers. They have to do other work in the cooperative and also raise livestock, which they often find overwhelming. Some semi-laborers also hope to participate more in the cooperative's labor and earn more workdays. As the cooperative's production develops, it is also necessary to more rationally and uniformly allocate the entire cooperative's full and semi-laborers, and there are also places for collective livestock raising, then another method stipulated in the draft model charter can be adopted: private ownership, public raising, and public use, with the cooperative giving the owner appropriate remuneration. This remuneration should of course be lower than the normal rent. When determining this remuneration, it should be considered that: on the one hand, the cooperative has to pay for the forage and labor day remuneration required for raising draught animals; the draught animals no longer occupy the owner's house. On the other hand, the owner also does not get the price of fertilizer accumulated from raising draught animals. Who does the small livestock born to privately owned and publicly raised draught animals belong to? A method can be negotiated according to local customs. Generally speaking, the cooperative and the owner can divide the income, because although the female animal belongs to the owner, the cooperative will use it less when it gives birth to small livestock. It is okay for it to belong entirely to the cooperative or entirely to the owner, depending on how much remuneration was originally given to the owner and what the local customs are. If privately owned and publicly raised draught animals die or become disabled due to poor care in the cooperative, the cooperative should also give the owner appropriate compensation.

The cooperative needs to unify the use of large farm tools and carts, boats, etc. privately owned by members, and rent can also be paid to the owner. The amount of the rent is negotiated according to how much these things were worth when they were first rented and how many years they can be used. The cooperative uniformly keeps these things rented from the members; if there is any damage, the cooperative is responsible for repairing it; if the damage is too severe and cannot be repaired, the cooperative will compensate (it should be compensated according to the extent to which it has already been worn out before the damage, and money can be given, not a new one).

How to remunerate the trees privately owned by members that are unified for management by the cooperative? This needs to be divided into several different situations:

For trees that require a lot of labor, such as orchards, tea mountains, mulberry fields, paulownia mountains, bamboo forests, etc., the amount of remuneration given to the owner should be based on the size of the income, how easy or difficult it is to manage, and also how much labor the owner spent before, and how much labor the cooperative will spend in the future.

For mature trees that require relatively little labor and generate relatively high income, such as pine forests and fir forests, the income obtained after the cooperative's management, after deducting the labor costs (forest protection, felling, transportation, etc.) and the due benefits, the rest is entirely given to the owner. In a word, the owner spent labor cultivating the trees before joining the cooperative. This labor should be given considerable remuneration, so it should be allowed that the sharing of profits from trees is slightly higher than the sharing of profits from labor.

The remuneration due to the owner of newly planted young forests can be given when these small trees grow up and generate income.

How to Transfer Main Means of Production to Public Ownership

How to transfer the main means of production that are privately owned by members, needed by the cooperative, and have the strength to buy, raise, or manage, to public ownership?

The private ownership and public use of draught animals cannot be considered the best method in the end. In order to develop production and carry out diversified management, cooperatives often need to buy some draught animals and sell some draught animals. If the draught animals are all privately owned, how can the cooperative carry out this adjustment? Moreover, privately owned draught animals are always inconvenient for public use; it is also very unfavorable for the cooperative to pay rent to the owners of draught animals for a long time. Therefore, the draft model charter stipulates that all cooperatives, after operating for a considerable period of time, should transfer the draught animals privately owned by members to public ownership by the entire cooperative, as long as they have the conditions. The method of transferring to public ownership is not confiscation, but purchase at the normal local price (annual average price). Some cooperatives have not been operating for long, but have the strength to buy and raise draught animals, and can also do this.

Large farm tools, carts, boats, etc. privately owned by members that the cooperative often needs to use, tools and equipment for sidelines suitable for collective management by the cooperative, contiguous young trees, and herds of livestock that the cooperative can manage, can also be purchased by the cooperative at the normal local price and transferred to public ownership, under the conditions that the cooperative and the owner both agree. The price paid by the cooperative for buying these things should be paid to the owner in installments within an appropriate period of time. How long should this period be? Generally speaking, it is more appropriate to pay off the price of draught animals, large farm tools, carts, boats, sideline tools, etc. within three years, and at most it should not exceed five years. How long it will take to pay off the price of contiguous young trees and herds of livestock can be determined by negotiation between the cooperative and the owner. Whether interest is given on the price of various means of production that has not been paid off, and how much interest is given, can also be handled by negotiation between the cooperative and the owner.

Where does the money for the cooperative to buy these things come from? According to the provisions of the draft model charter, generally speaking, it comes from the public ownership share fund shared by the members (there are different sharing methods according to different uses, which will be discussed in detail later when talking about the share fund). Since it is mainly shared by all the members, we must take into account everyone's ability to bear it. If the amount of this price is too large and many members cannot afford it, a portion can also be taken from the cooperative's public accumulation fund.

How to handle the means of production jointly owned by mutual aid teams when they are transformed into cooperatives or join cooperatives? In general, the entire group joins a cooperative; in this way, the means of production jointly owned by the mutual aid team can be transferred to public ownership by the entire cooperative. If individual team members have not joined the cooperative, the cooperative can give them appropriate compensation.

The main principles for handling these means of production of members are the same as those for handling land privately owned by members. Do not harm the interests of any poor peasants, nor harm the interests of any middle peasants; it must be beneficial to the entire cooperative, and the labor and investment originally spent by the members should be given due remuneration. With the methods stipulated in the draft model charter, plus everyone discussing it carefully together, we will surely be able to handle these things properly and fairly.

    公平合理地处理土地以外的生产资料
    何成
    农民的生产资料，除了土地以外，最重要的就是耕畜、农具、车、船；还有林木、牧畜、副业工具等等。农民入社的时候，对于社里怎样处理这些东西，也是非常关心的。有些农民就是担心社里对这些东西处理得不合自己的心思，所以拿不定入社的主意。现在，农业生产合作社示范章程草案上已经比较详细地规定了处理这些东西的原则，按照这些原则来处理，就能够叫社员大家都满意。
    哪些东西社里要统一使用
    社员的这些东西，是不是也都像土地那样必须交给合作社统一使用、统一经营呢？不完全是那样。这些东西是不是由合作社统一使用、统一经营，要看合作社是不是需要来决定。
  这些主要的生产资料有三类：
  第一类是农业生产上不可缺少的，就是耕畜
  （耕种用的马、牛、骡、驴等）、大农具（犁、新式犁、马拉农具、水车、风车、抽水机等）、农业运输工具（车、船等）等。这一类东西应该尽先由合作社统一使用。
    第二类是跟农业生产有密切关系的，就是成片的林木、成群的牲畜等。这一类东西一般地应该一步一步由合作社统一经营。
    第三类是跟农业的关系比较不密切的，就是大型的副业工具和副业设备。这一类东西，合作社需要统一使用的只是一部分。
  那些不是主要的生产资料，都不统一使用和经营。镰刀、锄头等小农具，由社员自备自修；零星树木，归社员自己所有，自己经营；家畜、家禽归社员自己所有，自己经营；适合家庭经营的副业的生产工具和设备，也应该归社员自己所有。就是初级社转成了高级社，这些东西也不实行公有。
    那些主要的、合作社需要的生产资料，在本主同意的条件下，可以按照合作社的需要、合作社的力量和别的条件，分批分期地一步一步地实行公有。在实行公有以前，由合作社统一使用、统一经营的时候，合作社要给本主适当的报酬；在实行公有的时候，合作社要给本主公平的代价。
    私有公用的东西怎样给报酬
    合作社对于私有公用的主要生产资料怎样给报酬呢？对于土地报酬，在一定的情况下，还可以暂时按全社农业收益的一定成数给报酬；对于土地以外的生产资料的报酬，就不能采用这种办法。一般地说，对耕畜、大农具、车、船、副业工具等是用付给租价的办法（在分配收益的时候，这一笔钱是从生产费里面出的）；对林木、牧畜要采取另外的办法。
    先拿耕畜来说吧。农民特别关心自己的耕畜，“一头牛就是半个家业”，很多人把自己心爱的牲口几乎当作家里的一口人看待，他们对这些牲口有很深的感情。他们爱惜自己的牲口，甚至舍不得和它分开。合作社刚办起来的时候，一般地说也缺少喂许多牲口的地方，缺少集体喂养牲口的经验。因此，示范章程草案上规定：一般的初办的合作社，耕畜可以暂时采取私有私养公用的办法；由合作社用付租价的办法给本主报酬。租价要相当于当地正常的租价。租价太低，就会使本主觉得吃亏；租价太高，只是两三年的租价就够买一头同样的牲口，对合作社里全体社员都不利，特别是牲口少的社员要吃亏。私有公用的耕畜，当然应该尽先让社里使用；在社里不需用的时候，本主可以自己使用，也可以借给别人或者租给别人用。但是，如果要卖这些耕畜，那必须得到合作社的同意。合作社用这耕畜的时候，如果因为照管不周到，使它死了或者残废了，要给本主适当的赔偿。如果是本主自己不经心喂养坏了，那当然由本主自己负责。采取这种办法，养耕畜积攒的肥料怎么处理？可以按当地租用耕畜的习惯商量确定。一般地说，肥料仍归本主，但合作社如果要买，得先卖给合作社。母畜生小畜的时候怎么办？小畜应该归本主，但合作社要按少用母畜的时间少付租价。
    有些社员家里有半劳动力，在自己家里喂养耕畜还方便；有些社员家里没有半劳动力，他们既要在社里多做别的工作，又要喂养牲口，往往觉得顾不过来。有些半劳动力也希望多参加社里的劳动，多得劳动日。社里的生产发展了，也需要更合理地统一调配全社的整劳动力和半劳动力，并且也有了集体喂牲口的地方，那就可以采用示范章程草案上规定的另一种办法：私有公养公用，由合作社给本主适当的报酬。这种报酬，当然要比正常的租价低。在确定这种报酬的时候，应当考虑到：一方面，合作社要出喂养耕畜所需要的草料和劳动日报酬了；耕畜不再占用本主的房屋了。另一方面，本主也得不到养耕畜积攒的肥料的价款了。私有公养的耕畜生下的小牲口归谁？这可以按照当地的习惯商量出个办法。一般地说，可以由合作社和本主伙分收益，因为母牲口虽然是本主的，但是在生小牲口的时候社里要少用它。完全归合作社或者完全归本主都可以，那要看原定给本主的报酬多少，当地的习惯怎么样。私有公养的耕畜，如果因为合作社里照顾不周到死了或者残废了，合作社也要给本主适当的赔偿。
    社员私有的大农具和车、船等，合作社需要统一使用，也可以给本主租价。租价的多少，按照开始租用的时候这些东西值多少钱、能用多少年来商量确定。合作社租用社员的这些东西，都由合作社统一保管；有了损坏，由合作社负责修理；如果损坏得太厉害，没法修理了，由合作社赔偿（应该按损坏以前已经用旧了的程度来赔偿，可以给钱，不是赔新的）。
    合作社统一经营的社员私有的林木怎样给报酬？这要分几种不同的情形：
    费工比较多的林木，像果园、茶山、桑田、桐山、竹林等，给本主的报酬的多少，要根据收益的大小、容易不容易经营，还要看本主以前费了多少工本，合作社今后要费多少工本。
    费工比较少、收益比较多的成材的林木，像松树林、杉木林等，合作社经营以后得到的收益，扣除了所费的工本（护林、砍伐、运送等）和应得的利益以后，剩下的完全给本主。总说一句话，本主在入社以前栽培林木，是费了劳动的。这种劳动应该得到相当的报酬，所以要允许林木分益稍稍高于劳动分益。
    新栽的幼林，本主应得的报酬可以到这些小树长大了有了收益的时候再给。
    主要生产资料怎样转为公有
    怎样把社员私有的、合作社需要使用而且有力量收买、饲养或者经营的主要生产资料转为公有呢？
    耕畜私有公用，归根到底不能算是最好的办法。合作社为了发展生产，进行多种经营，常常需要买进一些耕畜，卖出一些耕畜，如果耕畜都是私有的，合作社怎样进行这种调剂呢？而且私有的耕畜，公用总是不方便；合作社长期地给耕畜本主出租价，对合作社也很不利。因此，示范章程草案规定：一切合作社，办了相当时期，只要有了条件，就要把社员私有的耕畜转为全社公有。转为公有的办法，不是没收充公，而是按当地正常价格（全年平均价格）收买。有些合作社办得不久，但是有力量收买和喂养耕畜，也可以这样做。
    社员私有而合作社经常需要用的大农具、车、船等，适合合作社集体经营的副业的工具和设备，成片的幼小的林木，合作社能经营的成群的牧畜，在合作社和本主双方同意的条件下，也都可以由合作社按当地正常价格收买，转为公有。合作社收买这些东西的价款应该在适当的期限以内分期付给本主。这个期限究竟多长？一般地说，耕畜、大农具、车、船、副业工具等的价款，在三年内付清比较合适，至多不能超过五年。成片的幼小林木和成群的牧畜的价款要多少时间付清，可以由合作社和本主双方商量确定。在各种生产资料的价款没有付清的时候，是不是给利息，给多少利息，也可以由合作社和本主商量着办。
    合作社买这些东西的钱从哪里来？按照示范章程草案的规定，一般地说是由社员分摊的公有化股份基金里出（按照用处的不同，有不同的分摊办法，这在后边讲到股份基金的时候再详细谈）。既然主要是由社员大家分摊，就不能不照顾到大家的负担能力。如果这笔价款的数目太大，许多社员负担不起，也可以从合作社的公积金里出一部分。
    互助组公有的生产资料，在转成合作社或者加入合作社的时候怎么办？一般情况下，都是全组加入一个合作社；这样，就可以把互助组公有的生产资料转为全社公有。如果有个别组员没有入社，可以由合作社给他适当的补偿。
    处理社员的这些生产资料，同处理社员私有的土地的大原则是一样的。不损害任何贫农的利益，也不损害任何中农的利益；要对全社有利，也要使社员原来花费的劳动和投资得到应有的报酬。有了示范章程草案规定的办法，再加上大家在一块儿好好商量，准能把这些事情办得妥妥当当、公公道道。
