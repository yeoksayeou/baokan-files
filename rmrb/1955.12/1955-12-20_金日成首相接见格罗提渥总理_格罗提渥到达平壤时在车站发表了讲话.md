I sincerely thank the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for providing the opportunity to make a friendly visit to your country.

We have come here with a mission entrusted by the German people, which is to pay warm, militant respects to the heroic Korean brother people.

The people of the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving people in West Germany are watching with deep sympathy and genuine goodwill the brilliant achievements of the Korean working people in eliminating the wounds of war and building a new social system.

All peace-loving German people support and encourage the just demands of Korean patriots who are fighting for national self-determination and the peaceful reunification of Korea.

We are confident that the German people and the Korean people will surely be able to build their homelands into bastions of peace and democracy, eliminating the state of division of their countries caused by the vicious conspiracies of Western countries.

Our visit to your country at your invitation is a clear manifestation of the ever-growing and consolidating fraternal relations between our two peoples. I take this opportunity to express my heartfelt congratulations to the fearless citizens of the heroic city of Pyongyang. Pyongyang is engaged in an active and heroic struggle to heal the serious wounds inflicted by the atrocities of foreign aggressors in the last war. Long live the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the heroic Korean people! Long live the friendship and unity between the German and Korean peoples! Long live international peace!
