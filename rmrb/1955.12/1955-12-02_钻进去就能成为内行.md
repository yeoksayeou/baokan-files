    Getting Deeply Involved Makes You an Expert
    As told by Hu Shaoting, Secretary of the Communist Party Branch of Helin Township
    Helin Township in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, only started establishing cooperatives last autumn, and by this spring, eleven cooperatives had been set up. At that time, the enthusiasm of the masses was high, and our branch was also very motivated.
    However, problems arose when the spring plowing season came! Collective production was like "a young lady riding in a sedan chair for the first time," cooperative cadres had no experience, and members were not used to it. In the first few days, the cooperative members were quite energetic and very active in going to work; but there were no rules or arrangements, and the more people there were, the more chaotic it became. At the Helin cooperative, more than twenty people were sent to spread manure on a field of just over one mu, filling the field completely, with people's bottoms bumping against each other and hoes clashing. When the meeting was held in the evening to assess work points, there were so many people talking at once that it was like a crow's nest had been stirred up. Some people said their points were too few, while others said you weren't working hard enough, and it went on until late at night before they reluctantly dispersed.
    The cooperative cadres really had no choice but to turn to the Party branch. At that time, I simply didn't want to go out. As soon as the cooperative cadres saw me, they would pull me to a meeting to solve the problems. To be honest, I didn't have any solutions at the time. Once, I was walking past the Helin cooperative, and the director saw me. He pulled me over and said, "You've come at the perfect time! We're currently holding a meeting to figure out contract work, but we can't figure it out. Please give us some guidance!" I knew I was facing a difficult problem, so I quickly changed the subject and slipped away, leaving him standing on the side of the road sighing like a wooden figure.
    I used this method to avoid the problems they raised. But as the season became more urgent day by day, I became as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. I thought to myself: so many cooperatives have been established this year, but they're all messed up like this. How will this end! The more I thought about it, the more anxious I became, and my mood became depressed.
    It was really a coincidence that the county Party secretary and the county magistrate came down. That day, they asked me to report on the situation of running the cooperatives, and I raised a whole bunch of difficulties to them one after another. The county Party secretary said, "Now we are engaging in socialism, and engaging in socialism is an arduous and complex task. We should study diligently and delve into it." These words gave me great inspiration, and I expressed my determination to him: "I must learn how to engage in socialist work!"
    Where there's a will, there's a way. Comrades, as long as you are determined, things will be easy to handle. I started by learning from the newspapers. As long as there were articles about collectivization, I would study them carefully. When I didn't understand something, I would mark it with a pen and ask the primary school teachers and the comrades of the work team to teach me. In this way, I made rapid progress. At first, it took me an hour or two to read one page of a book, but later it only took me two or three hours to read a small newspaper. After that, my enthusiasm for learning became even greater. I often carried newspapers and documents about guiding rural work in my pocket. When I got home late at night after work, I would light a lamp and read for a while. My wife complained, "If you're so obsessed, when will you become a Number One Scholar!" I laughed and replied, "I don't want to become a Number One Scholar, I just want to engage in socialism!" She didn't say anything.
    Progress is rapid while learning and doing. The difficulties in the cooperatives occurred one by one, and we solved them one by one. You can learn a lot from the process of solving difficulties. At that time, the main difficulty in many cooperatives was the contract work problem. Seasonal contract work took too long, and permanent contract work was even more impractical. What to do? Once, I read about the experience of short-term contract work based on specific tasks in the newspaper. After discussing it with Zeng Zhaochun, the director of the Lianmeng [Alliance] cooperative, we decided to try a ten-day contract work period. So we held a committee meeting, laid out the work to be done within ten days, estimated the work points, and contracted it out to the groups. The committee members all said that this was good, and there was no need to call people to work in the morning or evaluate work points in the evening. After only two days, the members said it wouldn't work. The group leaders complained to the committee members, "You've put the burden on our shoulders, and we're so tired that we're walking upside down and can't get it done." Some simply asked to cancel the contract work. At this time, I went deep into the fourth production group to understand the situation and found that although the work was contracted to the groups, the groups had not made arrangements, and the members didn't know what to do from one day to the next. In the morning, they still had to call people to work, and in the evening, they still had to evaluate work points. The group leaders were exhausted. After discussing it with the group leader, I decided to arrange the work contracted from the cooperative to the groups every three days based on the members' strength and work ability. This method worked. The chaos was corrected, and the members actively went to work, completing the ten-day contract work in eight days. Then, other cooperatives also promoted the method of ten-day contract work and three-day arrangements. Production was going very well.
    But the bigger difficulties were yet to come. After the rice seedlings were transplanted, problems arose again. Many cooperative members were busy doing their own work, and if they didn't have land, they would rent it outside the cooperative or return the dry land they had invested in. As a result, the members were not active in going to work, and they were not active in investing. The cooperative needed to cultivate and fertilize the rice seedlings, but the members piled the manure and grass at home and didn't invest. One day, when the Huanglong cooperative was cultivating, it suddenly rained, and more than ten members shouted and rushed to plant their own sweet potato seedlings, resulting in the manure that had just been applied to the field being washed away by the rain. The problem became more and more serious. I was anxious again. I thought: running a cooperative is really difficult! Problems are like beads on a string, one thing after another. How long will it take to finish! But when I thought of the words of the county Party secretary and the county magistrate, I felt that my thoughts were wrong. Doing revolution is certainly not as easy as drinking egg drop soup. Solving a problem and overcoming a difficulty means moving the work forward!
    We then convened branch meetings and director meetings to study this issue. It is true that many people have great wisdom. As soon as the meeting was held, the problem became clear. It turned out that after transplanting the rice seedlings, the cooperative cadres thought that there was nothing to do, and they relaxed their efforts in production and did not arrange work for the members in a timely manner. How could the members be idle? In addition, the work was tight in the spring, and the education work for the members was relaxed. Reading newspapers and holding life meetings were not carried out in any cooperative. All kinds of reasons added up to create such a big problem. This incident gave me a little more knowledge: leading a cooperative cannot relax anything. We must manage the production in the cooperative and also manage the thinking of the members.
    The problem has already arisen, how to solve it? At that time, some cooperative cadres were impatient and demanded to severely rectify the "capitalist ideology" of the members. This approach is wrong. First, we leaders should also be responsible. Second, "rectification" is not a good way to educate the masses. Yu Huazhang, the director of the Helin cooperative, expressed his opinion, saying that their cooperative did not have this problem, and the members were highly motivated in collective production. Everyone was surprised and asked him to introduce his experience. He said: "After transplanting the fields, we held a committee meeting and a members' meeting to summarize the achievements of spring plowing and production, and also calculated the work and labor accounts. We found that the cooperative had a surplus of sixteen laborers, so we set up a sideline group with six members, led by a committee member, to help the supply and marketing cooperative with transportation. In this way, the cooperative's work is still not finished. Who has free time to rent land to grow sweet potatoes!" Look, what a good method this cooperative has! So we decided to immediately conduct a summary of work in each cooperative to improve the members' collectivist consciousness. Once the summary and education work was carried out, the situation in the cooperative improved a lot, and more members went to work. Later, we also organized the members to study the cooperative's charter, so that everyone realized that it was wrong to rent land outside the cooperative or return the dry land invested in, and finally properly solved this problem.
    The tense spring plowing season has passed, and at this time another problem was discovered: more than ten poor peasant members in the township had done very few work points, and there was a risk of reduced income after the autumn harvest. The branch then decided to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the implementation of class policy in the cooperatives. As soon as the inspection started, the problems were serious. Take the Liaoyuan cooperative as an example: at that time, the middle peasant members had done more than 500 work points, but the two poor peasant households, Zeng Chunsheng and Zeng Xianjin, together had only 240 work points. The director Tang Rihou was a Party member, but not only did he not help the poor peasants overcome difficulties, but he also complained that they were "hopeless and lazy." None of the eleven cooperatives paid attention to the work of cultivating poor peasant backbone members. Therefore, at the Party members' meeting, we conducted a class policy education for all Party members. I took the lead in making a self-criticism, and then combined the specific situations of each cooperative to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Through this meeting, all Party members received a profound education.
    In order to gain experience, I went to the Lianmeng cooperative to explore. Yuan Xijun, the leader of the third labor group of this cooperative, was a poor peasant youth. His family's life was very difficult. After the spring plowing, they ran out of food and were busy making a living every day, so they inevitably relaxed their leadership of production. One night, after the group meeting, he did not go back. I asked him, "How is the production in the group?" He said embarrassedly, "It's lagging behind!" I said, "You have quite a few difficulties!" Suddenly, his tears fell like rolling beans. I also felt very sad and wanted to say a few words to comfort him, but I couldn't. I gave him the five yuan salary I had received from the township government. He took the money and cried even more. He didn't say anything else and went back. After his life difficulties were temporarily resolved, he became active in his work. I encouraged him and often pointed out some of his shortcomings. In a month or two, the group he led changed its appearance. Everyone said he had made rapid progress. During the rush to harvest and plant, more than five mu of fields were dehydrated, and the rice stubble had to be dug with a hoe. He invited the League member Yuan Xibing to dig the rice stubble back all night, and the rice seedlings were transplanted the next day. Soon, he was admitted to the Party. From then on, all eleven cooperatives paid attention to cultivating poor peasant activists. Up to now, we have developed eight poor peasant activists into Party members in the cooperatives and cultivated twelve poor peasant activists. Due to the implementation of the class policy, not a single poor peasant member in the eleven cooperatives in the township had a reduction in income.
    The collectivization movement has moved forward. The set of skills learned in the first half of the year is no longer enough. We need to make further efforts to study.

    钻进去就能成为内行
    中共鹤林乡支部书记  胡绍庭口述
    湖南省宁乡县鹤林乡是去年秋季才开始建立合作社的，到今年春上，建立了十一个合作社。当时，群众的积极性高，我们支部的劲头也大。
    可是，一到春耕生产的时候，就发生问题啦！集体生产是“满姑娘坐花轿，头一次”，社干部没经验，社员不习惯。头几天，社员还蛮有劲的，出工很积极；但是没个规矩，也没个调摆，人越多就越乱。合林社在一丘一亩多大的田里下粪，一下去了二十多个人，把田站满了，屁股挨屁股，锄头碰锄头。到晚上开大会评工分，人多嘴杂，捣了乌鸦窝子似的，你说他的分子多了，他又说你做工不卖力，直闹到深更半夜，才马马虎虎散场。
    社干部实在没办法了，就找党支部。那时候，我简直不愿出门，一出门，给社干部看见了，就拉着叫我去开会，解决问题。说句实话，当时，我也没有什么办法。有一次，我打合林社门前走过，被社长看见了。他拉着我说：“你来得太好了，我们现在正开会搞包工，可怎么也搞不清楚，请你指导一下吧！”我知道碰着难题了，连忙用话岔开，溜掉了。让他像木人一样呆呆地站在路旁叹气。
    我就用这样的办法，回避了他们提出的问题。但是季节一天紧似一天，这时候，我急得像热锅上的蚂蚁。心想：今年建起这么多合作社，偏偏搞得这个样子。这样下去，如何收场呵！我越想越急，情绪消沉起来。
    事情真凑巧，县委书记和县长下来了。那天，他们叫我汇报办社情况，我接二连三地向他提出了一大堆困难。县委书记说：“现在是搞社会主义了，搞社会主义是艰巨、复杂的工作，应该勤学苦钻。”这些话给我很大的启发，我向他表示了自己的决心：“我一定要学会搞社会主义的工作！”
    人心专，石山穿。同志，只要下定决心，事情就好办了。我先从报纸上学起，只要有有关合作化的文章，我就认真学习。不懂的地方，我就用钢笔打个记号，看见小学教员和工作组的同志就请他们指教。这样，进步很快，开始个把钟头看不完一页书，后来不消两三个钟头就看完了一张小报纸。这以后，我的学习热情更高了，口袋里经常装着关于指导农村工作的报纸和文件，工作到半夜回到家中，也要撑起灯来看一个时候，我的妻子不满地说：“这样发狠，几时中到状元呀！”我笑着回答：“我不想中状元，只想搞社会主义！”她不吱声了。
    一边学一边做进步很快。社里的困难一个个发生，我们把它一个个解决了。从解决困难的过程中就可以学到许多东西。当时我们许多社的主要困难是包工问题，季节包工时间太长，常年包工更行不通。怎么办呢？有一次我在报纸上读到短期按活包工的经验，便和联盟社社长曾昭春研究后决定暂且搞个十天包工试试看。于是开了社务委员会，把十天内要做的工作摆出来，估完工分，包给小组。社务委员们都说这样做好，再不要清早喊工，晚上评工了。才搞了两天，社员又喊行不通了。小组长埋怨社务委员说：“你们把担子甩在我们肩上，累得我们调转脑壳作脚走也搞不开。”有的干脆要求取消包工。这时，我深入到第四生产小组去了解情况，才发现工作虽然包到了组，但是小组没有进行安排，社员今日不知明日事。早上照样要喊工，晚上照样要评工，小组长累得喘不过气来。我跟小组长研究后，决定把社包给组的工作根据社员力气、工作能力等来个三天一安排。这个办法行通了。混乱现象纠正了过来，社员也积极出工了，八天完成了十天的包工任务。于是其他社也推行了十天一包工，三天一安排的办法。生产都搞得很好。
    但是更大困难还在后头呢。插完秧，问题又发生啦。许多社的社员们都忙着干自己的活去了，没有地，他们就到社外去租，或者把入了股的旱地又退回来。这样一来，社员出工不积极，投资也不积极了。社里禾苗要中耕追肥，社员们把粪草堆在家里不投资。有一天黄龙社正在进行中耕，忽然天下雨，十多个社员一声喊，都抢插私人的红薯苗去了，结果社里刚下到田里的粪，被雨水冲得流失了。问题越来越严重。我又急了。我想：办社这工作真困难呀，问题像线串珠似的，牛事未去，马事又来，多久才有个完呀！但是，一想起县委书记和县长的话，就觉得自己想法不对了。干革命当然没有喝蛋汤那么容易，解决一个问题，克服一个困难，工作就前进一步嘛！
    我们就召开支部会、社长会研究这个问题，真是人多智广，一开会问题就闹清了。原来插秧后，社干部认为没事了，生产上松了劲，没有及时给社员安排工作。社员哪能闲着呢？加上春上工作紧，对社员的教育工作放松了，读报啦，开生活会啦，哪一个社都没有搞。种种原因加起来，便闹出了这样一个大问题。这件事使我增加了一点知识：领导合作社什么都不能放松，对社里的生产要管起来，对社员的思想也要管起来。
    问题已经闹出来了，怎么解决呢？当时有些社干部性子躁，要求狠狠地整一下社员的“资本主义思想”。这种做法是不对的，一来我们领导上也该负责，二来“整”也不是教育群众的好办法。合林社社长余华章发表了意见，他说他们那个社就没有这个问题，社员集体生产的积极性蛮高。大家都感到惊奇，就要他介绍经验，他说：“我们插完田就开了社务委员会、社员会，总结了春耕生产成绩，又算了一下工作和劳力账，发现全社要剩余十六个劳力，于是我们一方面把田里加踩一道草，加施一次肥，并且抽出六个社员成立一个副业组，由一个社务委员领导，帮助供销社搞运输。这样社里的工作还做不赢呢，哪个还有闲工去租土地种红薯呀！”看，这个社的办法多好！于是我们决定立即在各社进行一次总结工作，提高社员的集体主义觉悟。总结教育工作一开展，社里情况好了很多，社员出工的也多些了。以后我们又组织社员学习了社章，使大家认识到到社外去租地或把入股的旱地退回去的做法是不对的，最后妥善地解决了这个问题。
    紧张的春耕生产过去了，这时又发现一个问题：全乡有十多户贫农社员做的工分很少，秋后有减少收入的危险。支部便决定对合作社贯彻执行阶级政策的情况来一次全面检查。一检查问题可严重啦，就说燎原社吧：那时候，中农社员都作了五百多个工分了，可是贫农曾春生、曾献金两户合起来才有二百四十个工分，社长唐日厚是党员，不但没有帮助贫农克服困难，还埋怨他们说：“曾春生那号人硬是没有药救，又穷又懒。”十一个社都没有注意培养贫农骨干的工作。于是，在党员大会上，我们向全体党员进行了一次阶级政策教育，我带头作了检讨，然后结合各社的具体情况开展了批评和自我批评。通过这次会议，全体党员受到了一次深刻的教育。
    为了取得经验，我又到联盟社去摸索。这个社的第三劳动小组长袁锡均是个贫农青年，他家生活十分困难，春耕以后就没口粮，每天为糊口奔波，领导生产的事便不免放松了。有天晚上开完小组会，他没有回去，我问他：“组里生产如何？”他不好意思地说：“落后啦！”我说：“你的困难不小呵！”突然地他眼泪像滚豆子似地落了下来，我心里也怪难过，想说几句安慰他的话又说不出。我把在乡政府领的五元钱工资给了他。他接过钱眼泪更多了，他没有再说话，回去了。生活困难得到暂时解决以后，他的工作积极了，我鼓励他，也经常指出他一些缺点。个把月的工夫，他领导的小组变了样，大家都说他进步快。抢收抢插的时候，有五亩多田脱水了，禾蔸要用锄头挖，他邀着团员袁锡兵一个通夜把禾蔸挖了转来，第二天便插上了秧。不久，他被吸收入了党。从此以后，十一个社都注意了培养贫农积极分子，到现在我们在合作社内发展了八个贫农积极分子为党员，培养了十二个贫农积极分子。由于贯彻执行了阶级政策，全乡十一个社没有一户贫农社员减少收入的。
    合作化运动向前发展了，上半年学会的一套已不够用，我们还需要进一步努力学习。
