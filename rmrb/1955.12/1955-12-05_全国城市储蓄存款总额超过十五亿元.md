    Xinhua News Agency, December 4th. According to statistics from the Savings Department of the People's Bank of China, urban residents' savings deposits in banks continue to increase. As of November 20th, the total amount of urban savings deposits nationwide reached 1,534 million yuan, an increase of more than 90 million yuan compared to the end of August, and an increase of more than 260 million yuan compared to the end of 1954. In the five cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Chongqing, the number of households with bank deposits at the end of October increased by 113,219 compared to the end of August. According to statistics from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chongqing, and seven other cities in August, the average deposit period for various savings reached 158 days, 46 days longer than at the end of 1954, which makes it easier for the state to use these funds. The increase in urban savings also shows that the government's measures to reduce various deposit and loan interest rates have been supported by the people of the whole country.
    In order to facilitate deposits and withdrawals for the broad masses of people, the People's Bank has increased the number of grassroots savings institutions and established savings agencies in government offices, enterprises, troops, and organizations. At present, the People's Bank has more than 10,000 savings institutions scattered throughout the country, and about 1,200 savings agencies.

    全国城市储蓄存款总额超过十五亿元
    新华社四日讯　根据中国人民银行储蓄部门的统计，城市人民在银行的储蓄存款继续增加。到十一月二十日止，全国城市储蓄存款总额达到十五亿三千四百多万元，比八月底增加九千多万元，比一九五四年底增加二亿六千多万元。在北京、天津、上海、西安、重庆五个城市中，十月底在银行存款的户数比八月底增加十一万三千二百十九户。据北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、西安、重庆等七个城市八月份统计，各种储蓄的平均存期达到一百五十八天，比一九五四年底延长了四十六天，这样可以使国家更便于运用这笔资金。从城市储蓄额增加的情况也可以看出，政府降低各种存放款利率的措施已得到全国人民拥护。
    为了便利广大人民存款取款，人民银行增设了基层储蓄机构，并且在机关、企业、部队、团体等单位中设立了储蓄代办所。目前人民银行分散在全国各地的储蓄机构已有一万多处，储蓄代办所约一千二百多处。
