Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 13th: Prince Souphanouvong, representative of the Lao Fighting Units, recently issued a statement regarding the Lao Kingdom government's organization of unilateral general elections and its military offensive against the Lao Fighting Units.

From October 11th, when the Lao parties signed the cessation of hostilities agreement in Rangoon, to the present, the Lao Kingdom government forces have occupied twelve strongholds in the provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua. Currently, the Lao Kingdom government has used more than half of its military force to attack and occupy forty-four strongholds in Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces and is amassing strength to further occupy the land of the two provinces and eliminate the Lao Fighting Units.

In his statement, Souphanouvong emphasized the issue of general elections in Laos. He said that, according to the Geneva Accords, this general election must be organized throughout Laos and must be participated in by all citizens. This is precisely the desire of the entire Lao people and the firm and unwavering position of the Lao Fighting Units at the political conference. However, the Lao Kingdom government, under groundless pretexts, intentionally excludes the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel from the general election and suspends bilateral political negotiations. The Lao Kingdom government is unilaterally conducting elections in ten provinces. This unilateral election is completely undemocratic and violates the principle of a unified Laos. It is clear to everyone that the current unilateral election is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords. The Kingdom government's smear campaign against the Lao Fighting Units cannot obscure the fact that the Lao Kingdom government's current unilateral elections and military offensives are part of a continuous and systematic conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords. In this conspiracy, US imperialism and pro-American cliques are attempting to turn Laos into a US military base and colony.

Souphanouvong, in the name of the representative of the Lao Fighting Units, announced his firm opposition to the unilateral elections of the Lao Kingdom government and pointed out that the Lao Kingdom government must bear full responsibility for this practice.

Souphanouvong called on the entire Lao people to resolutely fight to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected, and to resolutely demand that the Lao Kingdom government cease all military actions and guarantee the right of all citizens (including the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel) to participate in free national general elections.

Finally, Souphanouvong appealed to the people of Indochina, Southeast Asia, France, and the world who love peace to support the just struggle of the Lao people.

    就老挝王国组织片面选举并进攻寮国战斗部队事
    寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯发表声明
    新华社河内十三日电　寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯亲王最近就老挝王国政府组织片面普选和向寮国战斗部队进行军事进攻发表了声明。
    从十月十一日老挝双方在仰光签订停止敌对行动协议到现在，老挝王国政府军队又占领了丰沙里和桑怒两省的十二个据点。目前，老挝王国政府已经用了他们一半以上的军事力量来进攻和占领丰沙里和桑怒两省的四十四个据点，并且正在集合力量，以进一步占领两省的土地和消灭寮国战斗部队。
    苏发努冯在声明中着重谈到了老挝的普选问题。他说，按照日内瓦协议，这一次的普选必须在老挝全国组织并且必须有全体公民参加。这正是全体老挝人民的愿望和寮国战斗部队在政治会议上所持的坚定不移的立场。但是，老挝王国政府却以毫无根据的理由为借口，有意把寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员排挤出普选之外，并且使双方政治谈判停止。老挝王国政府正在单独地在十个省份进行片面选举。这种片面选举是完全反民主的，是违反统一老挝的原则的。任何人都很清楚，目前的片面选举，是严重违反日内瓦协议的。王国政府对寮国战斗部队的诬蔑宣传，不能掩盖下面的事实，这就是：老挝王国政府目前的片面选举和军事进攻是连续地、有系统地破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋的一部分。美帝国主义和亲美集团在这个阴谋中企图把老挝变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。
    苏发努冯以寮国战斗部队代表的名义宣布坚决反对老挝王国政府的片面选举，并且指出老挝王国政府必须对这种做法负起全部责任。
    苏发努冯号召老挝全体人民为争取日内瓦协议得到尊重而坚决奋斗，坚决要求老挝王国政府停止一切军事行动，并且保证全体公民（其中包括寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员）能够参加全国自由普选的权利。
    苏发努冯最后呼吁印度支那各国、东南亚各国、法国和世界爱好和平的人民支持老挝人民的正义斗争。
