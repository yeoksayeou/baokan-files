In each workshop, the distinguished guests were warmly welcomed by the workers. Premier Grotewohl and others continuously smiled and waved to them in greeting. In the large rolling mill, the huge rolling mill was rolling angle steel for the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. On a blackboard newspaper with a peace dove and the words "Long Live Peace," Premier Grotewohl wrote the sentence: "Long live the worker comrades! Socialist construction is growing here." In the seamless steel tube plant, Premier Grotewohl viewed the production process and various specifications of steel tubes. He congratulated the workers on their achievements in manufacturing new products. Premier Grotewohl wrote in the seamless steel tube plant's commemorative book: "Your new products are of great significance to China's industrial construction. Under the invincible banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, advance towards new victories."

	After the visit, more than seven thousand employees of Anshan Iron and Steel held a grand welcome meeting. Premier Grotewohl conveyed the warm greetings of the German working class to all the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. He said that we are very happy when we see German machines helping you build your country in your factories. We help each other, and there is no need to say thank you, because without mutual help, there are no good friends. He said that the people of China and Germany are actively engaged in socialist construction, and the victory of socialism is reflected in the strength of the working class. In your huge steel factory, we have seen simple, hardworking, and highly class-conscious workers, and such workers can create infinite miracles. We have met the famous labor hero Wang Chonglun and many other workers. I suggest that you respect them, strive to learn from them, and catch up with them. In this way, your work will take another big step forward.

	After Premier Grotewohl's speech, Yuan Zhen, manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, on behalf of all the employees, presented Premier Grotewohl with a model of Tiananmen Square made by the employees using the steel they had rolled themselves.

    格罗提渥总理等到达鞍山参观
    新华社鞍山二十三日电　奥托·格罗提渥总理和德意志民主共和国政府代表团一部分团员，今天下午从沈阳坐专车到达鞍山。
    鞍山市市长李维民、中共鞍山市委员会第一书记杨士杰、中共鞍山市委员会第二书记兼鞍山钢铁公司经理袁振、鞍山钢铁建设公司副经理李超等到车站欢迎贵宾。当贵宾们走出月台的时候，聚集在车站前广场上的两千五百多市民热烈的鼓掌欢呼；在广场上，工人们为贵宾们表演了喜庆节日的龙灯舞和狮子舞。
    格罗提渥总理等先后参观了鞍山钢铁公司的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂。在各个车间，贵宾们受到了职工们的热烈欢迎。格罗提渥总理等不断地向他们含笑招手致意。在大型轧钢厂，庞大的轧钢机正在轧制供给建设武汉长江大桥用的三角钢。在一块画着和平鸽写着“和平万岁”的黑板报上，格罗提渥总理写下了这样一句话：“职工同志们万岁！社会主义建设正在这里成长。”在无缝钢管厂，格罗提渥总理参观了生产过程和各种规格的钢管，他祝贺工人们在制造新产品方面获得成就。格罗提渥总理在无缝钢管厂的纪念册上写着：“你们的新产品，对于中国的工业建设具有重大的意义，在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的战无不胜的旗帜下，向着新的胜利前进。”
    参观后，七千多鞍钢职工举行了盛大的欢迎会。格罗提渥总理向鞍山钢铁公司的全体职工转达了德国工人阶级的热情问候。他说，当我们在你们的工厂里看到有德国机器帮助你们建设祖国的时候，我们感到非常高兴。我们互相进行帮助，不必说什么感谢的话，因为如果没有相互帮助的话，就算不得什么好朋友了。他说，中德两国的人民都在积极的进行社会主义建设，社会主义的胜利是体现在工人阶级的力量中。在你们这个巨大的钢铁工厂里，我们看到了朴素勤劳的、具有高度阶级觉悟的工人，这种工人可以创造无限的奇迹。我们认识了著名的劳动英雄王崇伦和别的许多工人，我建议你们要尊重他们，努力向他们学习，赶上他们。这样，你们的工作就会又前进一大步。
    格罗提渥总理讲话以后，鞍山钢铁公司经理袁振代表全体职工，向格罗提渥总理赠送了职工们用自己轧制的钢材制作的天安门模型。
