    Harbin Department Store No. 4 did not complete its sales plan for the first three quarters of this year. Although the fourth quarter is the peak season, the plan completion situation is still very poor. Only 53.8 percent of the plan was completed in October, and only 60.7 percent in November.
    From the store leaders to the salespersons, everyone seems to have "reasons" for not completing the plan. Some believe that this is due to the store's poor location and lack of development prospects. Others believe that the plan is too ambitious. Therefore, some departments did not even distribute the quarterly plan to the sales teams. They believe that failure to complete the plan is due to objective reasons.
    Is it really due to objective reasons? Let's first look at how they organize their supplies. Taking winter-appropriate men's and women's wool socks, children's fleece pants, wool gloves, and wool woven women's headscarves as examples, they were not processed and delivered from the factory until late November. The fastest-selling and most popular cyan cotton overcoats were out of stock due to insufficient supply. Many customers could not buy suitable children's winter clothing here. More seriously, in order to handle accumulated inventory, they used the method of "not putting best-selling goods on the counter" to force customers to buy the accumulated inventory. The service attitude of the salespersons also lacks initiative and they do not warmly receive customers.
    The fact is very clear: the reason for not completing the sales plan is the failure to organize purchases and improve business practices according to people's needs. If we do not face these facts but blame heaven and man, the sales plan will certainly not be completed.

    不要怨天尤人
    哈尔滨市百货公司第四商店，今年前三个季度都没有完成销售计划。第四季度虽说进入了旺季，但是计划完成情况仍然很坏，十月份仅完成计划的百分之五十三点八，十一月份也只完成计划的百分之六十点七。
    计划完不成，从商店领导人员到营业员似乎都有“理由”，有的认为这是由于商店的地点不好，没有发展前途。有的认为这是计划大了。因此有的部的季度计划根本就没有往营业小组布置。他们认为完不成计划就是客观原因造成的。
    是不是因为客观原因呢？先看看他们如何组织货源吧，以冬季适销的男女毛袜、小孩绒裤、毛手套、毛织女头巾为例，直到十一月下旬才从工厂陆续加工出来；卖得最快最多的青色棉大衣，因进货不足而脱销；许多顾客在这里买不到合适的小孩冬装。更严重的是：他们为了处理积压商品，竟用“畅销货不往柜台上摆”的办法来挤顾客去买积压商品。营业员的服务态度也缺乏主动，不热情接待顾客。
    事实很清楚，不能完成推销计划的原因是没有根据人们需要组织进货，改进经营作风。不正视这些事实而怨天尤人，推销计划就一定不会完成。
