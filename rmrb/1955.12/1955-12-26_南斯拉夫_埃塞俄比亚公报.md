    Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, after a two-week visit to Ethiopia, Yugoslav President Tito embarked on a ship from the Ethiopian port of Massawa on the evening of December 24th to visit Egypt.

    Before President Tito's departure, a joint Yugoslavia-Ethiopia communiqué regarding President Tito's state visit to Ethiopia was issued in Massawa, Ethiopia.

    The communiqué stated that during President Tito's visit, in talks held between the President of the Republic and His Imperial Majesty the Emperor, as well as their assistants, in an atmosphere of sincerity and full mutual understanding, a broad exchange of views took place on the international situation, including the situation in the Middle East, and issues directly related to relations between the two countries.

    The communiqué stated that the two leaders expressed consistent views on the assessment of major international issues and the most effective ways to consolidate universal peace and achieve universal prosperity. Both sides reaffirmed that this goal can only be achieved on the basis of respect for the principles of independence, sovereign integrity, and equality of all countries and nations.

    The communiqué also stated that both sides attach importance to the freest international trade, the broadest international cooperation in the economic field, especially providing economic and technical assistance for the development of underdeveloped countries, without discrimination against any country or region. The communiqué believes that agreements between major powers to limit armaments and to organize the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes will make a special contribution to this goal.

    The communiqué stated that the policies adopted by the two countries, in the spirit of the principles of the United Nations, based on constructive cooperation with as many countries as possible—regardless of their ideological and other differences—have made and are continuing to make significant contributions to consolidating peace. Both sides have expressed their determination to continue to pursue this policy.

    The communiqué pointed out that Yugoslavia and Ethiopia are moving towards further strengthening the lasting and close friendship between the peoples of the two countries. The communiqué also expressed the two countries' agreement to strengthen mutual economic and technical cooperation, as well as scientific and cultural ties.

    新华社二十五日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社消息：南斯拉夫总统铁托在埃塞俄比亚进行了两星期访问以后，已经在十二月二十四日晚间从埃塞俄比亚的马苏阿港乘轮船动身前往埃及访问。

    公报说，在铁托总统访问期间，共和国总统和皇帝陛下以及他们的助手之间在诚挚和充分的互相谅解的气氛中进行的会谈中，对国际局势，包括中东局势，以及直接有关两国之间的关系的问题广泛地交换了看法。
    公报说，两国领袖在对主要的国际问题的估计以及巩固普遍和平和实现普遍繁荣的最有效的方法方面表示了一致的看法。双方共同确认，只有在尊重一切国家和民族的独立、主权完整和平等的原则的基础上才能达到这个目标。
    公报又说，双方都重视最自由的国际贸易，重视在经济方面最广泛的国际合作，特别是为落后国家的发展提供经济和技术援助，不歧视任何国家或地区。公报认为，大国之间达成协议来限制军备，和有组织地为和平目的利用核子能，对于这个目的将能提供特别的贡献。
