    Eliminating the Backlog of Seed Cotton
    Geng Daxiu
    This year's cotton harvest was abundant and early-maturing, with new cotton entering the market in large quantities during the peak season. Due to an underestimation of this year's abundant cotton harvest, supply and marketing cooperatives in most cotton-producing areas across the country have experienced a serious situation of insufficient processing and storage capacity, leading to a large backlog of seed cotton. In September, the national cotton-producing area supply and marketing cooperatives only processed and delivered 46.6% of the ginned cotton purchased that month to state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies. As cotton purchases increased daily, by the end of October, the backlog of seed cotton due to insufficient processing had increased by 48% compared to September, exceeding the peak backlog of seed cotton in the same period of 1952 by 157.4%.
    Some supply and marketing cooperatives in cotton-producing areas, instead of actively seeking ways to increase seed cotton processing, storage, and transportation capacity to meet the enthusiastic demand of cotton farmers to sell their cotton and eliminate the serious backlog of seed cotton, have resorted to measures such as limiting purchases or even suspending purchases to alleviate the pressure of the procurement work. Qidong County in Jiangsu Province once stipulated that each cotton farmer was only allowed to sell 50 jin of cotton at a time, and refused to purchase any amount exceeding this limit. In Fengxian County, 13 out of 22 cotton collection stations suspended purchases from October 13th onwards. In Zhangyao Village, Gong County, Henan Province, one cotton farmer was unable to sell his cotton after five consecutive attempts. Many cotton farmers are severely affected in arranging their economic lives and repaying loans because they cannot sell their cotton in a timely manner. The practice of supply and marketing cooperatives limiting purchases or even suspending cotton purchases is obviously wrong.
    The correct way for supply and marketing cooperatives to solve the problem of seed cotton backlog is to further organize and utilize private cotton gins, fully tap the potential for seed cotton processing, and increase seed cotton processing capacity. After some regions' supply and marketing cooperatives vigorously organized private cotton gins, they quickly eliminated the phenomenon of seed cotton backlog. The Mianyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hubei Province repaired and reassembled 819 of the 1,192 broken cotton gins collected during last year's floods and put them into production. In addition, they helped the masses repair more than 200 cotton gins and organized them for processing. Jianli County mobilized households with livestock but without cotton gins and households with cotton gins but without livestock to cooperate, and quickly started 719 animal-powered cotton gins. In early October, cadres of the Hanchuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative helped the masses repair more than 400 cotton gins, increasing the daily processing volume from 260,000 jin to 400,000 jin, eliminating the seed cotton backlog. Unfortunately, this work has not been universally valued. According to investigations, Hebei Province currently estimates that 32,000 manual cotton gins can be organized, but only 26,000 have been organized. In Jiangsu Province, the number of manual cotton gins that have been organized accounts for only about half of the total number of private cotton gins in the province. This situation is sufficient to show that supply and marketing cooperatives in some regions have serious shortcomings in organizing seed cotton processing capacity. Some staff members responsible for cotton collection and processing believe that this year's cotton harvest is abundant, the cotton collection task is easy to complete, and it doesn't matter if the processing capacity can't keep up and the collection is a little slower. This idea is extremely harmful. In fact, it will only make cotton procurement work more passive and chaotic in the context of farmers selling in large quantities. This is a manifestation of blind optimism and ideological paralysis. To meet the cotton farmers' demand to sell cotton, it is necessary to break through this ideological barrier and immediately take measures to fully utilize the manual cotton gins that have not yet been utilized.
    In order to maximize the potential of seed cotton processing, supply and marketing cooperatives can also implement day and night shifts in processing plants with suitable conditions. The Xinyu County Manual Cotton Gin Factory in Jiangxi Province increased the number of workers per cotton gin from two to three, taking turns eating and resting, so that the gins could continue running while workers rested. This improved the utilization rate of the cotton gins and alleviated the seed cotton backlog. In addition, many seed cotton processing plants in various regions have launched competition campaigns to compare quality and output, which has encouraged workers' production enthusiasm and improved the quality and quantity of cotton processing. These active practices are all very necessary.
    Since cotton procurement is highly seasonal, the situation that seed cotton processing capacity cannot keep up with procurement work is difficult to completely avoid in a certain period. Therefore, adding storage equipment and strengthening warehousing are also indispensable measures. In addition to quickly building simple warehouses based on possible conditions, local supply and marketing cooperatives can also effectively expand storage capacity by borrowing public housing and renting private houses. The Jinxian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiangxi Province, in addition to building a simple warehouse that can accommodate 120,000 jin of cotton, also rented four private houses at the Sanli cotton collection station, which can accommodate 170,000 jin of seed cotton, basically solving the warehouse problem. However, when renting private houses, attention should be paid not to scatter them too much, so as to facilitate cotton security and storage. When purchasing cotton from agricultural production cooperatives, some regions have adopted the method of paying a portion of the payment first, with the cotton temporarily stored by the agricultural cooperatives, and the supply and marketing cooperatives subsidizing a portion of the storage costs based on the specific circumstances. This not only solves the difficulty of insufficient storage equipment for supply and marketing cooperatives, but also avoids excessive cotton losses. Agricultural cooperatives have considerable potential for storing cotton. In Ningjin County, Hebei Province, only 80 agricultural cooperatives stored more than 4 million jin of seed cotton on behalf of the supply and marketing cooperatives. This method should be promoted in areas with current conditions. In addition, supply and marketing cooperatives in cotton-producing areas must also attach importance to the transportation of cotton. It is necessary to quickly and properly organize all kinds of transportation forces, and transport the seed cotton to the processing plants in a timely manner to strive for "fast collection, fast ginning, and fast transportation" to meet the needs of the country and cotton farmers.

    消除籽棉积压现象
    耿大庥
    今年棉花丰收早熟，旺季新棉大批上市。由于对今年棉花丰收估计不足，全国大部分棉产区的供销合作社都出现了加工、仓储力量不够，大量籽棉积压的严重情况：全国棉产区供销合作社九月份加工运交国营花纱布公司的皮棉只占当月收购量的百分之四十六点六。随着棉花收购量的日益增多，到十月底因加工不及而积压的籽棉，较九月份又增加了百分之四十八，超过积压籽棉最多的一九五二年同时期百分之一百五十七点四。
    有些棉产区的供销社不积极设法增强籽棉加工、保管和运输力量，满足广大棉农踊跃售棉的要求，消除籽棉积压的严重现象，反而用限量收购甚至停收等做法来企图减轻收购工作的压力。江苏省启东县曾经规定每户棉农每次只准卖棉五十斤，超过这个数量的便拒绝收购；奉贤县二十二个收棉站自十月十三日起就有十三个站停收；河南省巩县一区张窑村一个棉农接连五次都没有把棉花卖掉。许多棉农因不能及时卖出棉花，他们在安排经济生活以及归还贷款方面就不能不受到严重的影响。供销社限量收购甚至停收棉花的做法显然是错误的。
    供销社解决籽棉积压问题的正确办法就是要进一步组织和利用民间轧花车，充分发掘籽棉加工潜力，增强籽棉加工力量。有些地区的供销社大力组织民间轧花车以后，就迅速消除了籽棉积压现象。湖北省沔阳县供销合作社，把去年洪水期间收进的一千一百九十二台破烂轧花车修配成八百十九台好车投入了生产，另外还帮助群众修复轧花车二百多台一并组织进行加工；监利县发动有牲口无轧花车户和有轧花车无牲口户进行合作，很快就开动了畜力轧花车七百十九台；汉川县供销社的干部在十月上旬帮助群众修理了四百多台轧花车，使每日加工量由二十六万斤增至四十万斤，消除了籽棉积压现象。可惜这一工作并没有被普遍重视起来，根据调查，目前河北省预计可以组织人力轧花车三万二千台，现在只组织了二万六千台；江苏省已经组织的人力轧花车仅占全省民间轧花车的一半左右。这种情况足够说明某些地区的供销社在组织籽棉加工力量上是有严重缺点的。有些负责收棉、加工的工作人员认为今年棉花丰收，收棉任务好完成，加工力量赶不上，慢一些收也没关系，这种想法是极其有害的。事实上，在棉农大量出售的情况下，它只会使棉花收购工作更加处于被动和忙乱的地位。这是盲目乐观、思想麻痹的表现。要满足棉农的售棉要求，就必须打破这种思想障碍，立即采取措施，把还没有被利用的人力轧花车充分利用起来。
    为了发挥籽棉加工的潜力，供销社还可选择有条件的加工厂实行昼夜班生产，江西新喻县人力轧花厂由原来每台轧花车两个工人增加为每台轧花车三个工人，轮流吃饭，轮流休息，歇人不歇车，提高了轧花车的利用率，使籽棉积压的现象得以减轻。此外，不少地区的籽棉加工厂开展了比质量比产量的竞赛运动，鼓励了工人的生产热情，提高了棉花加工的质量和产量。这些积极的做法都是十分必要的。
    由于棉花收购的季节性很大，籽棉加工力量不能同收购工作相适应的情况在一定时期内很难完全避免。因此，增添保管设备、加强仓储也是不可缺少的措施。各地供销社除了根据可能条件迅速修建简易仓库外，借用公房和租赁民房也是扩大保管能力的有效办法。江西省进贤县供销社除建造一座能容纳十二万斤的简易仓库外，县内三里收花站又租借了四幢民房，也可容纳十七万斤籽棉，使仓库问题基本上得到解决。但是租用民房应注意不要过分分散，以便于棉花的保卫和保管。有些地区在收购农业生产合作社的棉花的时候，采取先付一部分货款，棉花由农业合作社暂行保管，由供销社根据具体情况补助一部分保管费用的方法，这样不但解决了供销社仓储设备不足的困难，并且可避免棉花过大的损耗。农业合作社的保管棉花的潜力是相当大的，河北省宁津县只八十个农业合作社就代供销社保管籽棉四百多万斤。这种方法在目前有条件的地区都应该推广。此外，棉产区供销社还必须重视棉花的运输问题。要迅速地、妥善地把各种运输力量组织起来，及时把籽棉运到加工厂加工，以争取做到“快收、快轧、快运”，满足国家和棉农的需求。
