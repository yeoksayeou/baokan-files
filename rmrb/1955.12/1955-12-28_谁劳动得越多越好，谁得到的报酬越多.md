    The division of production teams and production groups, and the assignment of tasks, will prevent chaos in collective labor. However, this does not guarantee that every member will work enthusiastically, nor that everyone will do their assigned work well. Because every member will naturally think: Will I get more labor remuneration if I work more and better? If the remuneration for those who work more and better is about the same as those who work less and worse, wouldn't it be taking advantage of those who are lazy and shirk, and disadvantaging those who are diligent and honest?
    To solve this problem, some cooperatives have adopted the method used by most mutual aid teams: first, assess a certain "base score" for each member according to the strength of their labor force and the level of their skills; after working every day, everyone would then reassess, adding points for those who do more and better, and deducting points for those who do less and worse. This is often referred to as "fixed score, flexible assessment." However, doing so inevitably leads to scoring until late at night every day. The assessment either ends up in quarrels and anger, with red faces, or nobody wants to offend anyone, and nobody speaks up. The assessment is unfair, and everyone gets tired of the meetings. Many people say: I'd rather give me a few points less, and not have to stay up all night; it's better to rest more and recharge, so I don't do less work tomorrow. Because there is no standard for adding or subtracting points, each team assesses separately, and everyone is afraid that other teams will assess higher, and their own team members will suffer, causing mutual suspicion and disunity. If the whole community assesses together, there are too many people, and it takes even longer, and one day's work cannot be assessed in one night. Because the assessment is based on the "base score," those with strong labor and high skills will still get a lot of work points when doing less strenuous work that doesn't require much skill; those with weak labor and poor skills, even if they do the same work as those with strong labor and high skills, and do it just as well, often do not get the same work points. Naturally, this cannot encourage everyone to work harder and learn skills harder. Every morning, you wait for me, I wait for him, and we don't go to the field until everyone is there. When assigning work, everyone rushes for the light work, and nobody wants to do the heavy work.
  Implement piece-rate wages
    What should we do then? There is a solution. The draft model regulations for agricultural producers' cooperatives stipulate the most reasonable method for calculating labor remuneration: implement a piece-rate wage system. This means that there is a fixed remuneration for each piece of work, and regardless of gender, age, strength, as long as you do your assigned piece of work well, you can get the same remuneration. In this way, we can truly achieve more pay for more work, and not disadvantage anyone who participates in the work of the community.
    To implement piece-rate wages, we need to set work quotas. A work quota for a certain type of work is the amount (quantity) and quality (good or bad) that a medium-strength labor force can achieve in one day under certain conditions of land, draught animals, farm tools, and weather. The quota should not be set too low; if it is set too low, most members can exceed it without much effort, and it will not better encourage everyone to work actively. The quota should also not be set too high; if it is set too high, most members will not be able to reach the quota, which will also hurt everyone's work enthusiasm. When this method is first implemented, there is no experience yet, so you can first have honest and reliable members do a few experiments. After it is set, if it is found to be too low or too high, it can be revised. After a period of time, when the working ability of most members has improved, the quota should also be revised.
    After the quota is set, what if there is a sudden major change, such as an unexpected heavy rain or wind, or a sudden problem with draught animals or farm tools? Then it can be discussed by the members' congress and the management committee, and calculated according to the changed conditions. In short, we must never disadvantage those who put in more effort and work harder.
    After the work quota is set, how do we calculate labor remuneration? Calculate according to labor days (one labor day is ten work points). Does completing one quota count as one labor day, and get ten work points? We can't do that. You have to know that the quota is the work that can be done in one day; the same work that can be done in one day varies in intensity, difficulty, the amount of hardship required, and the level of skill required, and its importance in production is different. If every type of work that completes a quota counts as one labor day, and gets ten work points of labor remuneration, who would want to do the heavy, difficult, and more laborious work? Who would want to put in the effort to learn skills? The amount of labor days that should be earned for completing the quota for various types of work should be stipulated as a standard of remuneration. Completing the quota for a medium-level work (which is medium in terms of lightness, difficulty, and ease among the various types of work in the cooperative) should be counted as one labor day (ten points). If it is heavier or more difficult, it should be counted more; if it is even heavier or more difficult, it should be counted even more. If it is lighter or easier, it should be counted less; if it is even lighter or easier, it should be counted even less. The various types of work in the whole community can be divided into several levels according to lightness, difficulty, and ease, and the same number of labor days (work points) should be recorded for completing a quota for the same level of work.
    How much should the remuneration difference be between the quotas of various levels of work? The draft model regulations stipulate: This difference should be neither too small nor too large. If the difference is too small, it will disadvantage members who undertake heavy and difficult work; if the difference is too large, everyone will rush to do the work with more remuneration and not do the work with less remuneration.
    The cooperative has not been established for long, and even many old cooperatives do not yet have the experience of setting work quotas and remuneration standards. What if we can't set them immediately after establishing the cooperative? Then we have to temporarily use "fixed score, flexible assessment." However, we must not be satisfied with this method. Every cooperative must, in accordance with the provisions of the draft model regulations, "stipulate the quotas and remuneration standards for various types of work as soon as possible, in order to overcome the chaotic phenomenon in labor remuneration and avoid losses in production."
    Is it not good to stipulate that a labor day is the remuneration for doing a certain amount of work, and to record one labor day for doing that much work? Why do we need to set work quotas and then calculate how many labor days we get according to the quota? Why bother with this "trouble"? This "trouble" is worthwhile and indispensable. Without a quota, we don't know how much work a person can actually do in a day, so it is difficult to divide the work, to set production plans, and to determine work responsibilities. Members do not know how much they should do for each type of work in a day and what standards they should reach, so they have no direction to strive for. With a quota, everyone will strive to reach and exceed the quota, which can greatly encourage all members to work actively, improve work methods, and learn skills. It is more troublesome to stipulate the quota, but once it is stipulated and listed in a table, it is clear at a glance, and it is very convenient to check when arranging production and calculating labor days.
    One labor day is ten work points, but how much is that actually? How much is it worth? No one can stipulate this for each cooperative. It all depends on how well the members of each cooperative work. The draft model regulations stipulate: "Generally speaking, the physical objects and cash obtained by the whole community in production throughout the year, after deducting production costs, accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and land remuneration, are divided by the total number of labor days of the whole community throughout the year, and the result is what each labor day should be allocated. The more income the whole community has throughout the year, the more a labor day will be allocated; the less income the whole community has throughout the year, the less a labor day will be allocated."
  Implement the contract labor system
    Who should register and calculate how many work quotas each member has completed and how many labor days should be recorded? Of course, not all of them can be registered and calculated by the director, management committee member, and accountant of the whole community. There are so many members that they cannot figure out how much work each person has done and how well they have done it. Work quotas and remuneration standards should be uniformly stipulated by the management committee and discussed and approved by the members' congress; each member's labor days should be recorded in each production team; and the production team should report it to the community.
    Entrust a certain production task to the production team for a limited period of time, calculating a certain number of labor days in advance according to the work quota and remuneration standard. This is called the contract labor system. After the contract labor system is implemented, on the one hand, each production team can clearly know what its work task is; on the other hand, it can clearly know how many labor days it can get for completing these tasks. This system combines the responsibility system and the piece-rate remuneration system. As long as the production team completes these production tasks according to the work quota (including quantity and quality) and ahead of the specified time, it can also get the originally calculated labor days. If the time for this production team to complete these work tasks exceeds the prescribed time limit, delays the farming season, and there is no special reason, the cooperative may reduce the labor days contracted to this production team at its discretion. If this production team encounters special difficulties in the production process and creates special achievements, the cooperative may also increase the labor days for this production team at its discretion. If the production team's work is completed on time, but it is not done well and does not meet the quality standards stipulated in the work quota, the cooperative may require the team to redo it (without giving labor days); if there is no time to redo it, it may also reduce the labor days contracted to this team at its discretion.
    How should the labor days obtained by the production team be distributed to the members? The draft model regulations stipulate: They should be distributed to the members according to the amount of work quota actually completed by each member. In this way, will the contracted work and the done work not match? Will the production team "lose" labor days? That won't happen. Because the contract is based on the work task, and the more work tasks there are, the more labor days there are. If you encounter unforeseen difficulties when contracting, and you still do the work well, or the work that the members actually do is more and better than originally contracted, the cooperative will add labor days to the team. If you are initially afraid that the annual contract labor will not be accurate, you can first implement "small contract labor" (contract labor for one cultivation section and season at a time), and then change it to "large contract labor" (annual contract labor) after you have experience.
    One of the benefits of implementing annual contract labor is that it is more convenient for the cooperative to manage production; and more importantly, the production responsibility is more clearly divided, which can better encourage everyone to do their work well. The draft model regulations stipulate: When implementing annual contract labor, the production team's required crop yield plan and the management committee's supply plan for means of production, which must be responsible for execution, should be stipulated, and a "surplus production reward system" should be implemented. That is to say: If a production team overfulfills the yield plan, the cooperative should give this team some labor days at its discretion; if a team is poorly managed and the yield is less than 90% of the number stipulated in the plan, the cooperative may reduce the labor days of this team at its discretion. This is generally referred to as "contracting work and contracting production." If there is an irresistible major disaster, what should we do? We can modify the yield plan according to the extent of the disaster. Those who produce more than the modified plan can get rewards for adding labor days; if the team completes the modified yield plan, but the yield obtained under the same circumstances is less than 90% of the yield stipulated by the modified plan, it will also be penalized for deducting labor days.
    If any production team, production group, or member creates a good method in terms of production technology and production management, and plays a great role in improving the community's production, it can get more rewards. If any production team, production group, or member wins in the labor competition in the community, the community should also reward them.
    Remuneration of community leaders
    Community leaders and staff are particularly concerned: There is a lot of community work, and they cannot often participate in productive labor. Will they get fewer labor days? The draft model regulations have already made provisions for this issue: For each leader and staff member of the community, the members' congress can agree each year to subsidize him an appropriate number of labor days according to the amount of work he undertakes and the quality of his performance. If the scale of the community is very large, and the director and accountant must be separated from productive labor in order to do their work well, the members' congress can also agree on the remuneration they should receive. In general, the remuneration they receive should be equivalent to or higher than the average number of labor days earned by medium-strength labor forces. We must never allow the income of those who work for the whole community to be less than the income of the community's medium-strength labor forces. Leaders and staff who are often responsible for the work of the whole community should also receive appropriate rewards when the whole community overfulfills the production plan.
    In short, the cooperative should calculate remuneration for each member's various labors (including physical labor and mental labor) according to the principle of more pay for more work. The more and better you work, the more labor days you can get, and you will never suffer. Most importantly, every member must remember: Not only do you want to earn more labor days, but you must also try your best to do your work well, so that the community's income can indeed increase; only in this way can each labor day get more things. Some members only care about earning more labor days and don't do their work well. In the end, the community's income is reduced, and the labor day is worthless. Who is this harming? There is such a story: Ten old men were chatting together, and one old man suggested that they gather again tomorrow, and each bring a bottle of wine, pour it into a large wine pot, and everyone drink heartily. Each old man thought he was the smartest, thinking: "It doesn't matter if there is a bottle of water mixed in ten bottles of wine." The next day, the ten old men all poured the "wine" from their wine bottles into the large wine pot. After drinking, there was no taste of wine at all. You looked at me, and I looked at him, and no one could say anything; everyone drank some water for a while, and dispersed without interest. Can we learn from these ten old men?

    谁劳动得越多越好，谁得到的报酬越多
    何成
    把生产队、生产组分好了，谁做什么工作也分好了，集体干活就不会乱了。可是，这还不能保证每个社员都很起劲地劳动，也不能保证每个社员都把分给自己的工作做得很好。因为，每个社员很自然地都会想到：干得多干得好能不能多得劳动报酬呢？如果干得多干得好的同干得少干得坏的得到的报酬差不多，岂不是让偷懒耍滑的人沾了便宜，勤恳老实的人吃了亏？
    有些合作社为了解决这个问题，采用了大部分互助组用的那种办法：先按照每个社员劳动力的强弱和技术的高低，每个人评定一定的“底分”；每天做活以后，大家再来评，做得又多又好的加分，做得又少又坏的减分。这也就是常说的“死分活评”。可是，这样做，就难免天天评分评到大半夜。评起来不是吵架闹气，面红耳赤，就是打不开情面，谁也不吭声。评来评去评不公，开会开得人人烦。很多人说：宁可少给我几分，别叫我熬夜了；这样还不如多休息休息养好精神，免得明天少做一晌活。因为加分减分没有一定的标准，这个队那个队分开评，谁也怕别的队评高了，自己队里的人吃亏，互相猜疑，闹不团结。全社在一块评吧，人又太多，评起来更要拖长时间，一天做的事一夜也评不完。因为是按“底分”评的，劳力强、技术高的人在做费力少、不需要什么技术的工作的时候，得到的工分也少不了多少；劳力弱、技术差的人同劳力强、技术高的人，即使做一样的工作，做得一样好，也往往得不到一样的工分。这样，自然不能鼓励大家加劲干活，加劲学技术。每天早上，你等我，我等他，等不齐就不下地。分工的时候，轻活大家抢，重活没人干。
  实行按件计酬
    那该怎么办呢？有办法。农业生产合作社示范章程草案上规定了最合理的计算劳动报酬的办法：实行按件计酬的制度。这就是说，做哪一件工作都有一定的报酬，不论男女老少，劳力强弱，只要把分给自己的这件工作做好了，就都能得到同样的报酬。这样，就能确实做到多劳多得，不叫任何一个参加社里劳动的人吃亏。
    要实行按件计酬，需要规定工作定额。一种工作的定额，就是在一定的土地、耕畜、农具、天时等条件下，一个中等的劳动力做这种工作做一天能够做到的数量（多少）和质量（好坏）。定额不应该规定得太低；定得太低了，多数社员不费力就可以超过，就不能更好地起鼓励大家积极劳动的作用。定额也不应该定得太高；定得太高了，多数社员都达不到定额，也会伤害大家的劳动积极性。初实行这个办法的时候，还没经验，可以先由老实可靠的社员做几次试验。定出来以后，发现定得太低了或者太高了，还可以修改。过一个时期，绝大部分社员的工作能力都提高了，也应该修改定额。
    定额规定出来以后，突然遇到了很大的变化，比如遇到了原先没有估计到的大雨大风，或者耕畜、农具突然发生了毛病，怎么办？那可以经过社员大会和管理委员会讨论，按照变了的条件来计算。总之，决不能叫多出力、多费劲的人吃亏。
    有了工作定额以后，怎么计算劳动报酬呢？按劳动日计算（一个劳动日就是十个工分）。是不是完成了一个定额就算一个劳动日、就记十个工分呢？不能那么办。要知道，定额是一天能做的工作；同是一天能做出来的工作，轻重不一样，难做容易做不一样，需要受的辛苦不一样，需要的技术高低不一样，它在生产中的重要性也不一样。如果不管哪一种工作完成了一个定额都算一个劳动日，都给十分的劳动报酬，谁还愿意做重的、难做的、多费辛苦的工作呢？谁还愿意下功夫学技术呢？完成各种工作的定额应该各得多少劳动日，应该规定出报酬标准来。完成一种中等工作（它在合作社的各种工作中，按轻重难易来说是中等的）的定额，应该记一个劳动日（十分）。比它重、比它难做的，就应该比它多记；更重、更难做的，就更多记。比它轻、比它容易做的，就应该比它少记；更轻、更容易做的，就更少记。可以把全社的各种工作按轻重难易分成几等，完成同一等工作的一个定额，就记同样的劳动日（工分）。
    各等工作定额之间的报酬应该差多少？示范章程草案规定：这种差别既不要太小，也不要太大。差别太小了，就会使担任重的难做的工作的社员吃亏；差别太大了，就会发生大家都抢做报酬多的工作、不做报酬少的工作的情形。
    合作社刚办没多久，连许多老社也还没有规定工作定额和报酬标准的经验，办了社不能马上就能规定出来，怎么办？那只好暂时还是“死分活评”。可是，决不能满足于这种办法。每个合作社都必须按照示范章程草案的规定，“尽快地规定各种工作的定额和报酬标准，以便克服劳动报酬上的混乱现象，避免生产上的损失”。
    规定一个劳动日是做多少工作的报酬，做多少工作就记一个劳动日，不好吗？为什么要规定工作定额，按照定额再来计算得多少劳动日？何必多这一道“麻烦”？这“麻烦”是值得的，不可少的。没有定额，就不知道一个人一天究竟能做多少工作，就不好分工，不好定生产计划，不便确定工作责任。社员不知道做哪种工作一天应该做多少、达到什么标准，就没有努力方向。有了定额，大家就要努力争取达到定额、超过定额，就可以大大鼓励全体社员积极工作、改进工作方法和学习技术。规定的时候，是要麻烦一些；规定好了，列成一个表，一目了然，安排生产的时候和计算劳动日的时候一查就可以，很方便。
    一个劳动日是十个工分，可是，究竟是多少东西？值多少钱？这个，谁也不能给各个合作社规定出来，全看各个合作社的社员们干得怎么样。示范章程草案上规定：“一般地说，全社全年在生产中得到的实物和现金，在扣除生产费、公积金、公益金和土地报酬以后，用全社全年劳动日的总数来除，除出来的就是每一个劳动日所应该分到的。全社全年的收入越多，一个劳动日分到的也越多；全社全年的收入少了，一个劳动日分到的也就少了。”
  实行包工制
    哪个社员完成了多少工作定额，该记多少劳动日，由谁来登记和计算呢？当然，不能都由全社的主任、管理委员、会计员来登记和计算。社员那么多，他们没法子弄清楚究竟谁做了多少工作、做得怎么样。工作定额和报酬标准应该由管理委员会统一规定出来在社员大会讨论通过；每个社员的劳动日应该在各个生产队里记；生产队记了以后再报到社里去。
    把一定的生产任务，按照工作定额和报酬标准，预先计算出一定数目的劳动日，包给生产队限期完成。这就叫做包工制。实行了包工制以后，一方面，各个生产队可以明确地知道自己的工作任务是什么；另一方面可以明确地知道完成这些任务可以得到多少劳动日。这种制度把责任制和按件计酬制结合起来了。生产队只要把这些生产任务按照工作定额（包括数量和质量）完成了，比限定的时间提前了，也可以得到原来计算好的劳动日。如果这个生产队完成这些工作任务的时间超过了规定的期限，误了农时，而且没有特殊的原因，合作社可以酌量扣减包给这个生产队的劳动日。如果这个生产队在生产中间碰到了特殊的困难，创造了特殊的成绩，合作社也可以酌量地给这个生产队增加劳动日。如果这个生产队的工作虽然按期做完了，可是没有做好，没有达到工作定额上规定的质量标准，合作社可以要求这个队重做（不给劳动日）；如果时间已经来不及重作，也可以酌量扣减包给这个队的劳动日。
    生产队包了工，所得的劳动日怎样分配给社员呢？示范章程草案规定：应该按照各个队员实际上完成工作定额的多少分配给社员。这样，会不会包的和做的对不起头来呢？生产队会不会“赔”劳动日呢？那不会。因为包的时候就是按工作任务包的，工作任务多了，劳动日也多。如果临时碰到在包的时候没料到的困难仍然把工作做好了，或者社员实际上做的工作比原来包的又多又好，合作社就会给队里加劳动日。最初怕常年包工包不准确，可以先实行“小包工”（一个一个耕作段落和季节的包工），有了经验以后再改成“大包工”（常年包工）。
    实行常年包工的一个好处是合作社管理生产更方便；还有更重要的好处是生产责任分得更清楚，更能鼓励大家把工作做好。示范章程草案规定：在实行常年包工的时候，应该规定生产队必须完成的农作物的产量计划和管理委员会必须负责执行的生产资料的供应计划，并且实行“超产奖励制”。也就是说：哪个生产队超额完成了产量计划，合作社就要酌量多给这个队一些劳动日；哪个队经营得不好，产量不到计划规定的数目的百分之九十，合作社可以酌量扣减这个队的劳动日。这就是一般所说的“包工包产”。实行这种办法，万一遇到不能抵抗的大灾害怎么办？那可以根据受灾的程度修改产量计划。比修改了的计划多产的，可以得到加劳动日的奖励；别的队完成了修改的产量计划，这个队在同样的情况下得到的产量却不到修改了的计划规定的产量的百分之九十，也要受到扣劳动日的处罚。
    任何一个生产队、生产组或者社员在生产技术、生产管理方面如果创造了好的办法，对社里的生产的改进起了很大作用，都可以得到更多的奖励。哪个生产队、生产组或者社员在社里开展劳动竞赛中间得到了胜利，社里也要奖励。
    社内领导人员的报酬
    合作社的领导人员和工作人员特别关心：社务工作多，自己不能经常参加生产劳动，岂不是要少得劳动日？示范章程草案上对这个问题已经作了规定：对社里的每个领导人员和工作人员，可以每年由社员大会议定，根据他所负担的工作的多少和成绩的好坏，补贴他适当数目的劳动日。社的规模如果很大，社主任、会计员必须脱离生产劳动才能把工作做好，也可以由社员大会议定他们应得的报酬。总要使他们得到的报酬相当于或者高于中等劳动力所得的劳动日的平均数。决不能让为全社办事的人的收入反而比社里的中等劳动力的收入少。经常负责全社的工作的领导人员和工作人员，在全社超额完成了生产计划的时候，也应该得到适当的奖励。
    总之，合作社对于每个社员的各种劳动（包括体力劳动和脑力劳动），都要按照多劳多得的原则给计算报酬。劳动得越多越好，就能得到越多的劳动日，决不会吃亏。最要紧的，每个社员都要记住：不光要多得劳动日，还要尽力把工作做好，使社里的收入确实能够增多；只有这样，才能使每一个劳动日得到更多的东西。有些社员光顾多挣劳动日，不把工作做好。到末了，全社收入少了，劳动日也就不值钱了。这是坑害谁呢？有这么一个故事：十个老头在一块谈天，一个老头提议明天再来聚会，每人都带一瓶酒来，倒在一个大酒壶里，大家痛饮
  一场。每个老头都觉得自己最聪明，想着：“十瓶酒里掺一瓶水不要紧。”第二天到了一块，十个老头都把酒瓶里的“酒”倒在大酒壶里了。一喝，一点酒味也没有。你看着我，我看着他，谁也不好说出来；大家喝了一阵子水，好没兴趣地散了。我们能学这十个老头吗？
