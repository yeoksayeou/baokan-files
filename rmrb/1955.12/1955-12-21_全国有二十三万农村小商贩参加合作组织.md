Throughout the country, 230,000 rural small traders and peddlers have joined cooperative organizations through supply and marketing cooperatives this year, playing a significant role in expanding commodity circulation and facilitating buying and selling for the masses.

Under the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperatives, cooperative stores and cooperative groups in rural areas across the country are generally able to operate according to the needs of the masses, changing the phenomenon of blindly pursuing market profits and mutual exclusion that existed under the past decentralized management. For example, private merchants in Da Kunlun District, Zibo City, Shandong Province, previously only had one person selling salt because the profit margin on salt was low. People had to travel several miles to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy salt, and it was very crowded. Now, four cooperative stores are operating salt according to plan, which has changed this situation. Many farmers happily say: "The supply and marketing cooperative has organized private merchants in this way, so we suffer less, travel less, and lose less working time. It's really a good method."

After small traders and peddlers participate in cooperative organizations, they can collaborate, concentrate the use of funds, and thus save expenses and increase commodity varieties. For example, the local product and sundry goods cooperative group in Jiuxiang Town, Hanyuan County, Sichuan Province, saved more than 230 yuan in purchase expenses in just nineteen days of operation. The commodities operated by cooperative stores in various places have generally increased from dozens in the past to two or three hundred. The cotton cloth and general merchandise cooperative group in Shalingzi Town, Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, even increased the number of commodities it carried to more than 1,400. After the small traders and peddlers are organized, because the business volume expands and the expenses decrease, the surplus generally increases compared to the past. According to a survey of 181 shop assistants in 34 cooperative stores in Shandong Province, 70.86% of the shop assistants increased their income, and 29.14% of the shop assistants were able to maintain their livelihood or maintain their original income level. Many cooperative stores have also accumulated a certain amount of public funds. After a period of operation, the public accumulation fund of the pork cooperative group in Yongxing Town, Mianyang County, Sichuan Province, has exceeded 1.47 times its original capital. Cooperative stores in various places generally have established learning systems, coupled with the constant education of the supply and marketing cooperatives, and the ideological awareness of the shop assistants has been improved to a certain extent, and the management style has generally undergone great changes.

The superiority of cooperative stores and cooperative groups has educated the vast number of rural small traders and peddlers. Many small traders and peddlers actively demand to be organized. At present, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are conducting overall planning, preparing to actively and systematically incorporate rural small traders and peddlers into cooperative organizations.

    全国有二十三万农村小商贩参加合作组织
    今年全国各地供销合作社已经组织了二十三万名农村小商小贩参加了合作组织，对于扩大商品流转，便利群众购销起了不小的作用。
    各地农村的合作商店和合作小组在供销合作社的领导下，一般都能根据群众需要进行经营，改变了过去分散经营时盲目追逐市场利润和互相排挤的现象。如山东省淄博市大昆仑区的私商，过去因为食盐利润低，只有一个人经营食盐，群众吃盐需要跑好几里路到供销合作社去买，而且很拥挤；现在有四处合作商店按计划经营食盐，已经改变了这种情况。许多农民高兴地说：供销合作社把私商这样一组织，我们少吃亏，少跑路，少误工，真是好办法。
    小商小贩参加合作组织以后，能够分工协作，集中使用资金，因而节省了费用开支，增加了商品品种。如四川省汉源县九襄镇土产杂货合作小组开业只十九天，就节省了进货开支二百三十多元。各地合作商店经营的商品一般都由过去的几十种增加到二三百种，河北省宣化县沙岭子镇棉布、百货合作小组经营的商品还增加到了一千四百多种。小商小贩组织起来以后，由于营业额扩大，费用开支减少，盈余一般都比过去增加。据山东省三十四处合作商店的一百八十一个店员的统计，百分之七十点八六的店员都增加了收入，百分之二十九点一四的店员能够维持生活或者维持原来收入的水平。许多合作商店还积累了一定数量的公共资金。四川省绵阳县永兴镇猪肉合作小组经过一个时期的经营，积累的公积金已经超过原来自有资金一点四七倍。各地合作商店一般都订立了学习制度，加上供销合作社经常的教育，店员的思想觉悟都有了一定的提高，经营作风一般也都有很大的改变。
    合作商店和合作小组的优越性，教育了广大的农村小商小贩。许多小商小贩积极要求组织起来。目前，各地供销合作社正在进行全面规划，准备积极地有计划地把农村小商小贩纳入合作组织。
