Party Organizations in Enterprises Must Be Close to the Masses

The current situation in many industrial and mining enterprises is that party organizations are not close enough to the masses. The work of many party organizations lags behind the reality, and staff members have contracted bureaucratic tendencies, relying solely on holding meetings, drafting documents, and issuing generalized appeals to carry out party work.

Meetings, planning, and summarizing are naturally indispensable in our work, but some enterprise party organization staff spend their days in endless meetings and voluminous documents and reports. Holding and attending meetings, drafting and reading documents have almost become their primary work. They spend their main time and energy on these aspects, with the result that meetings are not well held, and summaries and plans are not well made. The party secretary of Harbin's Factory 449 presides over or attends approximately twenty-six routine meetings each month, each meeting lasting about four hours, totaling about one-half of his monthly working time. Coupled with writing materials, reading documents, etc., the time for approaching the grassroots and getting close to the masses is very little. In June of this year, this party secretary did not visit the workshop even once. Although the situation has changed slightly recently, the situation where leading cadres cannot go deep into the workshops due to too many meetings still exists. The number of summary reports in enterprise party organizations is also astonishing. From January to June of this year, the Shuangcheng Line General Branch Committee of the Harbin Railway Bureau submitted eighteen summary reports. The reports are not only numerous but also lengthy, with word counts ranging from several thousand to even tens of thousands. The cadre work summary for 1954 written by the Cadre Section of the Political Department of the Shenyang Railway Sub-bureau was as long as ten thousand words. The multitude of meetings, documents, and reports is certainly greatly related to the style of provincial and municipal party committees that are accustomed to relying on meetings and documents to guide their work, but the fact that enterprise party organizations are not close to the masses, and rely mainly on holding meetings and issuing documents to carry out their work, is indeed an important reason.

Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly taught us that we must approach the masses and make overall plans in order to break the state of our thinking lagging behind reality. According to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, the leading organs and leading staff at all levels of our party should strive to approach the masses and approach reality; party organizations and staff in enterprises should also be closer to the masses and closer to reality. Because the party organization in an enterprise is the party's basic organization and fighting bastion in the enterprise, it must frequently approach the masses, carry out propaganda and organizational work among the masses, in order to realize the party's propositions and the various resolutions of higher-level organizations, constantly pay attention to and report to higher-level organs the sentiments and demands of the masses, care for the political, economic, and cultural lives of the masses, and organize the masses to solve their own various problems.

In order to be close to the masses, party organizations and staff in enterprises should not only widely approach the workers but also be good at individually contacting the workers, giving them ideological and work assistance based on the specific requirements and specific situations of each worker, and constantly improving their level of awareness. However, some party organizations have forgotten this correct working method, believing that individually contacting workers is not suitable for the needs of large enterprises, and are accustomed to using simplistic or even administrative command methods to do party work. In order to launch the "Eliminate Accidents Month" campaign, the General Branch Committee of the Changchun Locomotive Depot did not pay attention to carrying out in-depth political work among the masses, but simply asked party members and the masses to sign their names to show their support. These comrades do not understand that since the work of the party organization is work on people, it should be carried out according to the characteristics of people. The members of an enterprise are very complex, they have different requirements and ideological situations, and they have different strengths and weaknesses. Different people will have different views on the same thing. Therefore, the party organization must carry out work according to the characteristics of various people. General appeals and mobilizations are necessary. The party organization must universally explain the party's policies and guidelines to the masses through general appeals, put forward the party's propositions and demands, and widely mobilize the masses to respond to the party's call. However, if there is only general mobilization and one is not good at individually contacting the workers, it is impossible to solve the different problems of various people, it is impossible to meet their various different requirements, and it is impossible to make them consciously respond to the party's call. In this way, the general appeal is in danger of failing.

The advanced driving the general and the backward is an important way to improve labor productivity. The various initiatives of advanced elements are a huge driving force for us to overcome shortcomings and continue to move forward. The realization of the party's resolutions often depends on the leading and exemplary role of advanced elements. Advanced elements are the bridge between the party and the broad masses. Therefore, party organizations in enterprises must first approach the advanced elements among the masses, and must pay great attention to the cultivation and education of advanced figures in various fields. At present, some party organizations are still unable to cherish even the slightest socialist enthusiasm of the masses, as Comrade Mao Zedong taught us. Many leaders do not adopt a warm welcome and active support attitude towards the buds of new things and new forces, and cannot help them overcome difficulties and eliminate obstacles; some new forces are left to fend for themselves, and some beneficial initiatives have not been supported in a timely manner or have even been attacked. Many party organizations have not given advanced figures individual opportunities for cultivation and education tailored to various different situations, so that some model workers and advanced producers become proud after receiving awards and being commended, and even cannot complete their production tasks. These shortcomings should be corrected.

Party organizations should greatly strengthen the work of so-called backward elements, and change their views on backward elements. It should be recognized that there are naturally some bad elements among backward elements, but this is, after all, a minority, and the vast majority of so-called backward elements are backward precisely because of the weak political work of the party organization. Some workers are lagging behind because they have special difficulties in life and production, and no one understands them and helps them. Some workers are deeply influenced by the old society and are slow to accept new things. If the party organization only has general appeals for them, without specific and in-depth political work, it is difficult for them to improve. There are also a few people who are corroded by exploitative ideas and even often have some bad behaviors. Many party organizations rarely carry out meticulous ideological work on these people, which is, in fact, sitting idly by and watching them remain backward or even degenerate in the long term. Special attention should be paid to the fact that some workers who are considered backward often include a part of the old workers. Old workers are not as easy to accept new things as young people, or have some special difficulties in life that are not taken care of, so their production enthusiasm is not high or their political development is slow, and as a result, they are considered backward elements. This situation must be changed. Old workers are the backbone of production, and if the party organization cannot unite them and give play to their strengths, production will suffer losses. Therefore, if the party organization finds that some of the masses are not ideologically conscious, it should contact them more, care for them more, understand their difficulties and requirements, listen to their opinions, specifically and not generally clarify their opinions and doubts about the party's policies and then carry out in-depth individual education work. Facts have proved that many workers who were originally considered backward will progress and even become activists as long as the party organization patiently conducts ideological work with them. If they are not patiently educated and actively helped, but discriminated against, ridiculed, or even attacked, these workers may become more and more alienated from the party organization. It should be seen that activists are only a minority in the ranks of the masses after all, and although backward elements do not account for the majority either, if the party does not educate them, they will have an impact on the masses in the intermediate state.

Party organizations should comprehensively care for the workers. Party organizations should not only care about the difficulties and requirements of the masses in production, but also care about the difficulties and requirements of the masses in life and learning. Party organizations should not only educate the masses to treat production with a socialist labor attitude, but also educate the masses to handle family life and social life in accordance with socialist principles. Only in this way can the class consciousness of the masses be comprehensively improved, and can the broad masses consciously unite around the party organization. However, some enterprise party organizations only know how to make demands on the masses, but do not pay attention to meeting the demands of the masses, especially do not care about the lives of the masses, and even ignore the suffering of the masses. As a result, some workers are "socialist at work, capitalist off work." This not only damages the physical and mental health of the workers and causes losses to production, but also leaves a big gap for the corrosion of bourgeois ideology and the activities of counter-revolutionary elements. Is this tolerable?

To comprehensively care for the masses, it is necessary not only to care for the requirements of the majority, but also to care for the requirements of the minority with various special circumstances. Every unit will have a part of such people, such as employees transferred from other places, returned overseas Chinese employees, demobilized soldiers and cadres, new workers who have just come out of the countryside and schools, female workers with children, ethnic minority employees, etc. They will have some special requirements and difficulties in life, work, and learning, so they need more careful care. But precisely because they are a minority, their requirements are particularly easy to be ignored. This point should be paid special attention to.

The staff of party organizations in enterprises must be liberated from being busy with holding meetings and drafting documents, etc. The party secretary should first set an example himself, often approach the masses, make friends and talk to the masses, and solve various practical problems for the masses. Only in this way can we lead all the party's staff and all party members to value and do a good job in mass work. In this way, the party's leadership work in the enterprise will not lag behind the reality, and the combat effectiveness of the party organization in the enterprise will be greatly strengthened.

### 企业中的党组织必须接近群众

    企业中的党组织必须接近群众
    许多工矿企业的党组织目前的状况是接近群众不够，许多党组织的工作落后于实际，工作人员染上了官僚主义的毛病，仅仅依靠召开会议、拟发文件和依靠一般化的号召来进行党的工作。
    开会、计划、总结，在我们的工作中自然是不可少的，但是，有些企业党组织的工作人员成天在无休止的会议和长篇累牍的文件报告中过生活，召开会议和参加会议，草拟文件和阅读文件几乎成了他们的主要工作。他们把主要时间和精力都消耗在这方面，结果会议也开不好，总结和计划也作不好。哈尔滨四四九工厂党委书记每月要主持或参加的各种例会约二十六次，每次会议约四小时，合计起来约占每月工作时间的二分之一左右，再加上写材料、看文件等等，接近基层、接近群众的时间就很少了。今年六月份，这位党委书记就一次也没有去过车间。最近情况虽然稍有改变，但是由于会议过多，领导干部不能深入车间的情况仍然存在。企业党组织中总结报告之多也是十分惊人的。哈尔滨铁路管理局双城线路总支委员会，今年一月到六月，上报的总结报告就有十八份，报告不但多，而且长，字数总要几千以至上万。沈阳铁路分局政治处干部科所写的关于一九五四年干部工作总结长达一万字。会议多、文件表报多固然和省、市党委习惯于靠会议和文件指导工作的作风有很大关系，但是企业党组织不接近群众，主要靠召开会议和拟发文件来进行工作，也确实是一个重要原因。
    毛泽东同志屡屡教导我们，必须接近群众、全面规划，才能打破我们的思想落后于实际的状态。根据毛泽东同志的指示，我们党的各级领导机关和领导工作人员都应该努力接近群众、接近实际；企业中的党组织和工作人员也应该更加接近群众、接近实际。因为企业中党的组织是党在企业中的基层组织和战斗堡垒，它必须经常接近人民群众，在人民群众中进行宣传和组织工作，以实现党的主张和上级组织的各种决议，经常注意并向上级机关反映人民群众的情绪和要求，关心人民群众的政治的、经济的、文化的生活，组织人民群众来解决他们自己的各种问题。
    为了接近群众，企业中的党组织和工作人员不但应该广泛地接近工人，而且应该善于个别地接触工人，根据一个一个工人的具体要求和具体情况，给他们以思想上、工作上的各种帮助，不断提高他们的觉悟程度。可是，有些党组织忘掉了这个正确的工作方法，却以为个别地接触工人不适合于大企业的需要，而习惯地用简单化的甚至行政命令的办法来做党的工作。长春机务段总支委员会为了发起“消灭事故月”运动，不去注意在群众中进行深入的政治工作，只是叫党员和群众进行签名表示拥护。这些同志不了解，党组织的工作既然是对人的工作，就应该根据人的特点去进行。企业中的成员是很复杂的，他们各有不同的要求和思想情况，各有不同的长处和缺点。对于同一件事情，不同的人就会有不同的看法。因此党组织就必须根据各种人的特点来进行工作。一般的号召和动员是必要的。党组织要通过一般的号召向群众普遍地解释党的政策方针，提出党的主张和要求，广泛地动员群众来响应党的号召。但是，如果只有一般的动员，而不善于个别地接触工人，就不可能解决各种人的不同的问题，就不能够满足他们各种不同的要求，不能够使他们都自觉地响应党的号召。这样，一般的号召就有落空的危险。
    先进的带动一般的和落后的，这是提高劳动生产率的重要办法。先进分子的各种倡议，是我们克服缺点不断前进的巨大推动力量。党的决议的实现，经常要靠先进分子的带头作用和模范作用。先进分子是党和广大群众联系的桥梁。因此，企业中的党组织必须首先接近群众中的先进分子，必须十分注意对各方面的先进人物的培养教育。目前，有些党组织还不能像毛泽东同志教导我们的那样，爱惜群众的任何一点微小的社会主义积极性。不少领导者对新鲜事物的萌芽，对新生力量，还不是都采取热烈欢迎和积极支持的态度，不能帮助他们克服困难排除障碍；有些新生力量自生自灭，有些有益的倡议没有及时得到支持甚至反而受到打击。很多党组织对先进人物没有针对各种不同的情况，个别地给以培养教育的机会，以至有些劳动模范、先进生产者在得了奖、受了表扬以后，就骄傲起来，甚至不能完成生产任务。这些缺点都应该注意纠正。
    党组织应该大大加强对所谓落后分子的工作，改变对落后分子的看法。应该认识到，在落后分子中自然有一部分坏分子，但是这毕竟是少数，绝大多数所谓落后分子，他们所以落后，正是党组织政治工作薄弱的结果。有些工人表现落后，是因为他们在生活上、生产上有特殊的困难，没有人去了解他们和帮助他们。有些工人受旧社会的影响较深，接受新鲜事物较慢，党组织对他们如果只有一般的号召，而没有具体深入的政治工作，他们就很难得到提高。也有少数人受了剥削思想的侵蚀，甚至经常有一些不良行为。不少党组织对这些人很少进行细致的思想工作，这就是在事实上坐视他们长期落后甚至堕落下去。特别应该注意的是，在有些人认为落后的工人中，常常包括一部分老工人。老工人不像青年人那样容易接受新鲜事物，或者生活上有些特殊困难得不到照顾，因而生产情绪不高或者政治上开展不快，结果就被认为是落后分子。这种状况必须改变。老工人是生产中的骨干，党组织如果不能团结他们，发挥他们的长处，生产就要受到损失。因此，党组织如果发现有些群众的思想觉悟不高，就应该更多地接触他们，更多地关怀体贴他们，了解他们的困难和要求，倾听他们的意见，具体地而不是笼统地弄清楚他们对党的方针政策的意见和疑虑，然后进行深入的个别教育工作。事实证明，许多原来被认为落后的工人，只要党组织耐心地向他们进行了思想工作，他们就会进步起来，甚至成为积极分子。如果对他们不进行耐心教育和积极帮助，而歧视、讽刺甚至打击他们，这些工人就有可能越来越同党组织疏远了。应该看到，积极分子在群众的队伍中毕竟只是少数，落后分子虽然也不占多数，但是党如果不教育他们，他们就会在中间状态的群众中发生影响。
    党组织应该全面地关心工人群众。党组织不仅要关心群众生产上的困难和要求，而且要关心群众生活方面和学习方面的困难和要求。党组织不但要教育群众用社会主义的劳动态度对待生产，而且要教育群众用社会主义的原则处理家庭生活和社会生活。只有这样，才会全面地提高群众的阶级觉悟，才能使广大群众自觉地团结在党组织的周围。但是，有些企业党组织却只知道去要求群众，而不注意满足群众的要求，特别是不关心群众生活，甚至漠视群众疾苦。因而有些工人“上班是社会主义，下班是资本主义”。这就不但使工人的身心健康受到损失，使生产受到损失，而且，给资产阶级思想的侵蚀、给反革命分子的活动留下了一个很大的缺口。难道这是能够容忍的吗？
    要全面关心群众，不仅要关心多数人的要求，还要关心有各种特殊情况的少数人的要求。每一个单位都会有一部分这样的人，比如从外地调来的职工、刚回国的华侨职工、转业军人和干部、刚从农村中和学校中出来的新工人、有孩子的女工、少数民族职工等等，他们在生活、工作和学习方面都会有一些特殊的要求和困难，因此就需要更细心地照顾他们。但是正因为他们是少数人，他们的要求就特别容易被忽视。这一点，应该特别引起注意。
    企业中党组织的工作人员必需从忙于召开会议和拟发文件等束缚中解放出来，党委书记应该自己首先做出榜样，经常接近群众，和群众交朋友、谈心事，为群众解决各种各样的实际问题。只有这样才能领导全体党的工作人员和全体党员，重视和做好群众工作。这样，党在企业中的领导工作才不至落后于实际，企业中党组织的战斗力就会大大加强起来。
