Zhejiang Province has decided to trial ten small-scale rural hydroelectric power stations this winter and spring. Counties such as Yin County, Qu County, and Jinhua County have already been confirmed as sites, and the rest are in the design phase.

These ten small-scale rural hydroelectric power stations are being built according to the principle of "people-run and government-assisted" to meet the needs of the great development of the agricultural cooperative movement and the gradual construction of a new socialist countryside.

After these power stations are completed, each station will have a maximum power generation of 25 kilowatts. This electricity can supply power to local town industries, develop mechanized irrigation, improve agricultural productivity, and meet the local people's needs for lighting. For example, the annual electricity of the Dajiao Station in Yin County can supply the power needed to process 300,000 jin of rice and press 70,000 jin of oil, and can also supply electricity for lighting. Moreover, after the power station is built and the original floodwaters are impounded, it can also change the farming system of many farmlands.

After the news of construction starting in various places spread, the local farmers were all overjoyed. After farmers in the Daxi Township area of Changhua County learned that a power station was to be built in their hometown, they all expressed their willingness to actively support the construction work.

    浙江决定试办十个小型发电站
    浙江省决定在今冬明春试办十个农村小型水力发电站。现在已经确定建站的有鄞县、衢县、金华等县，其余正在设计中。
    这十个农村小型水力发电站是适应农业合作化运动的大发展和逐步建设社会主义新农村的需要而按“民办公助”原则兴建的。
    这些发电站建成以后，每站的最高发电量有二十五瓩。这些电力可以供应当地城镇工业的动力，发展机械灌溉，提高农业生产力，并且可以满足当地人民照明的需要。如鄞县大皎站的全年电力可以供给加工三十万斤稻谷和轧油七万斤所需的动力，还可以供应照明用电，而且建筑好发电站，把原来的洪水拦蓄起来以后，还可以使许多农田改变耕作制度。
    各地动手建站的消息传出以后，当地农民个个欢欣鼓舞。昌化县大溪乡一带的农民知道自己的故乡要建立发电站以后，都表示要积极支持建站工作。
