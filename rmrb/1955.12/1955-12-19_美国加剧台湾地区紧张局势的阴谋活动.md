    US Conspiracy to Intensify Tensions in the Taiwan Area
    Despite the fact that the Sino-US talks for the peaceful settlement of disputes between the two countries are still in progress, American officials and generals have shown increasing interest in Taiwan, a territory of China, and their words have become increasingly unrestrained and seriously threatening. A recent example is US Secretary of the Army Brucker's visit to Taiwan. After visiting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' exercises, Brucker openly stated that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique are "jointly engaged in an important preparation to deal with a common enemy."
    Following Brucker, US Secretary of the Navy Thomas arrived in Taiwan on the 16th. At the same time, US Secretary of the Air Force Quarles, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, and Dulles will also visit Taiwan one after another. Their activities are clearly aimed at completing war preparations against the Chinese people in order to continue occupying Taiwan indefinitely.
    Currently, the US war preparations are proceeding in two ways: on the one hand, strengthening the military power of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and on the other hand, intensifying the transformation of Taiwan into an American military base.
    According to the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the United States will soon help train nine new divisions of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and some of the necessary equipment has already been shipped to Taiwan. A US destroyer for the Chiang Kai-shek clique will soon sail to Taiwan from the United States. Sunnahl, commander in charge of air force materials at the US Far East Air Force Command, and Warren, assistant chief of logistics at the Far East Air Force Command, recently arrived in Taiwan from Tokyo. It is said that the mission of these two Americans to Taiwan is to prepare for the large-scale supply of Sabre jet fighters to the Chiang Kai-shek clique by the United States.
    Under American supervision, the troops of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which have received US military assistance, are stepping up drills. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Taiwan, Kinmen, and Matsu are continuously holding exercises. Foreign merchant ships sailing along the Chinese coast have become targets for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit air force to practice bombing and strafing. The latest victim in this regard is the British merchant ship "Hangtong."
    At the same time, the United States is turning the Penghu Islands into its military base in the Taiwan Strait. Newspapers of the Chiang Kai-shek clique revealed that under the direction of naval technicians from the US Far East Naval Headquarters, military projects are being built at Magong Port in the Penghu Islands. A large number of personnel from the US military assistance advisory group in Taiwan have arrived in the Penghu Islands.
    Not only that, the United States is making Taiwan an important part of its military base network in the Far East, strengthening coordination and connection between them. Wang Shuming, commander-in-chief of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit air force, went to Tokyo in early December to hold talks with US and Japanese authorities. It is reported that the issue they discussed was the organization of a so-called "joint air defense" between Taiwan and other US military bases in the Far East. Subsequently, a batch of US Sabre jet fighters flew from South Korean bases to Taiwan in a so-called "maneuver exercise." According to a Japanese radio report, the purpose of this exercise was to "use all combat units of the US Western Pacific defense system in the areas where they are most needed." Prior to this, the commander of the US First Cavalry Division stationed in Japan and the commander of the US military in Okinawa visited Taiwan at the end of November. The commander of the US military in Okinawa also discussed so-called "joint defense" issues with the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
    All of this shows that some people in the United States are not interested in easing tensions in the Far East and the Taiwan region through negotiations with China, but in continuing to use military threats against China to achieve the goal of occupying Taiwan and preventing the easing of the situation in the Far East and the Taiwan region.
    The United States will never achieve its goal of preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan through military threats. The US military activities in the Taiwan area can only make people suspect that its so-called "no use of force" proposition is just a deception. The Chinese people will continue to strive to ease and eliminate tensions in the Taiwan area through peaceful means, but the Chinese people will never give up their sacred sovereignty to liberate their territory of Taiwan under any threat.

### 美国加剧台湾地区紧张局势的阴谋活动

    美国加剧台湾地区紧张局势的阴谋活动
    尽管为了和平解决中美两国之间的争端而举行的中美会谈仍然在进行，美国的官员们和将军们对于台湾这块中国的领土却表现了越来越大的兴趣，他们说的话也越来越放肆和带有严重的威胁的味道。最近的例子就是美国陆军部长布鲁克的访问台湾。布鲁克在参观蒋贼军的演习以后公然说，美国正和蒋介石集团“合力从事一项重要的准备，来对付共同的敌人”。
    继布鲁克之后，美国海军部长托马斯已于十六日到达台湾。同时，美国空军部长卡利斯、美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福和杜勒斯，也都将先后到台湾活动。他们的这些活动显然就是为了完成针对中国人民的战争准备工作，以便继续无限期地侵占台湾。
    目前美国的战争准备正在从两方面进行，一方面是加强蒋介石集团的军事力量，另一方面是加紧把台湾变成美国的军事基地。
    据蒋介石集团透露，美国不久将帮助训练蒋介石集团九个新的师，一部分必需的装备已经运到台湾。一艘美国给蒋介石集团的驱逐舰不久就将从美国开到台湾。美国远东空军司令部负责空军物资工作的司令桑奈尔和远东空军司令部后勤工作助理负责人华伦，不久以前由东京到达台湾。据说，这两个美国人去台湾的任务是要替美国大规模供给蒋介石集团佩刀式喷气机作好准备。
    在美国监督之下，得到美国军事援助的蒋介石集团的军队正在加紧操练。台湾、金门、马祖的蒋贼军都接连不断地举行演习。而在中国沿海航行的外国商船就成了蒋贼空军练习轰炸扫射的靶子。这方面最近的受害者就是英国商船“航通号”。
    同时，美国正在把澎湖列岛变成它在台湾海峡中的军事基地。蒋介石集团的报纸透露，在美国远东海军总部的海军技术人员主持下，澎湖列岛的马公港正在建筑军事工程。美国在台湾的军事援助顾问团的人员大批地到达了澎湖列岛。
    不但如此，美国正在使台湾成为美国在远东的军事基地网中的重要的一环，加强它们之间的策应和联系。蒋贼空军总司令王叔铭在十二月初到东京去和美日当局举行会谈。有消息说，他们所讨论的问题是在台湾和美国在远东的其他军事基地之间组织所谓“空军联合防御”。接着，一批美国的佩刀式喷气机在一次所谓“机动演习”中由南朝鲜基地飞往台湾。据日本电台报道说，这次演习的目的在于“把美国的西太平洋防御体系的全部战斗单位用到最需要的地区去”。在此之前，驻日本的美国第一骑兵师师长和驻琉球的美军司令在十一月底访问了台湾。而美国驻琉球美军司令还同蒋介石集团也讨论了所谓“共同防御”问题。
    所有这一切都表明，美国的某些人有兴趣的并不是通过同中国谈判来和缓远东和台湾地区的紧张局势，而是用继续对中国实行武力威胁来达到侵占台湾的目的，阻挠远东和台湾地区局势的和缓。
    美国要想用武力威胁来阻挠中国人民解放台湾，这个目的是永远达不到的。美国在台湾地区的军事活动只能使人怀疑它的所谓“不使用武力”的主张只是一个骗局。中国人民将继续努力通过和平方式来和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势，但是中国人民决不会在任何威胁之下放弃解放自己的领土台湾的神圣主权。
