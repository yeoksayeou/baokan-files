    The Han River Highway Bridge Connecting Hankou and Hanyang Completed
    Builders Transferred to Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Construction Site
    The Han River Highway Bridge, an important component of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge that spans the Han River, has been completed. The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee has decided to name this bridge "Jianghan Bridge."

    The bridge builders spent a year and just over a month completing the Han River Highway Bridge. During the intense foundation construction period, the South experienced a rare severe winter. The Han River froze over, and the temperature dropped to minus fifteen degrees Celsius. Iron barges, steel cofferdams, and pile frames on the construction site were covered in ice. Braving the fierce wind and snow, workers wrapped their rubber shoes in burlap and straw, climbed to high altitudes, and persisted in construction. They finally completed the bridge piers in the center of the river before the Han River peach blossom flood arrived at the construction site, overcoming the most arduous and complex stage of the Han River Highway Bridge project.

    The surface of the Han River Highway Bridge can accommodate several cars side by side, with sidewalks on both sides. The tall lampposts on the bridge can also be equipped with steel frames for suspending trolleybus power supply equipment in the future. After the Han River Highway Bridge is completed and opened to traffic, it will connect Hankou and Hanyang, providing more convenient transportation for the Yangtze River Bridge under construction, industrial development in the Wuhan area, and residents. The Han River Highway Bridge and the future Yangtze River Bridge highway section will further connect the highway transportation networks of provinces north and south of the Yangtze River.

    The builders from the Han River Highway Bridge construction site, carrying their bridge-building experience, have transferred to the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site. In the spring of this year, when the Han River Highway Bridge was under intense construction, the construction team had fewer than a thousand people. Now, when all the builders have transferred to the right bank construction site of the Yangtze River Bridge, it has developed into a bridge engineering team with nearly two thousand people, possessing a complete range of skills. During the construction of the Han River Highway Bridge, the builders learned many skills for building modern bridges.

### 联结汉口汉阳的汉水公路桥已经建成  公路桥的建设者转移到武汉长江大桥工地

    联结汉口汉阳的汉水公路桥已经建成  
    公路桥的建设者转移到武汉长江大桥工地
    武汉长江大桥重要组成部分之一——横跨汉水的汉水公路桥已经建成。武汉市人民委员会已经决定将这座桥梁命名为“江汉桥”。
    桥梁建设者们，用了一年零一个多月的时间，建成了汉水公路桥。在基础工程紧张施工的日子里，正值去冬今春南方稀有的严寒。汉水冰封了江面，气温曾经降低到零下十五度，工地上的铁驳船、钢围囹和桩架上都冻结着坚冰。工人们冒着狂风暴雪，用麻布、稻草裹住胶鞋，爬上高空，坚持施工，终于在汉水桃花汛来到工地以前，把江心的桥墩修出水面，跨过了汉水公路桥工程最艰巨复杂的阶段。
    汉水公路桥桥面上可以并行好几部汽车，两旁有人行道。桥面上高大的灯柱，将来还可以装置用来悬挂无轨电车供电设备的钢架。汉水公路桥建成通车以后，就使汉口和汉阳联结起来，为修建中的长江大桥、武汉地区的工业建设和居民，提供更便利的交通运输条件。汉水公路桥和未来的长江大桥公路桥部分，将使长江南北各省的公路运输网，进一步沟通和连接起来。　（新华社）
    汉水公路桥工地上的建设者，已经带着建桥经验，转移到了武汉长江大桥工地。今年春天，汉水公路桥紧张施工的时候，施工队伍还不足一千人。现在，当建设者们全部转移到长江大桥右岸工地的时候，已经发展成为一个工种齐全、拥有近两千人的桥梁工程队了。汉水公路桥的建设者在施工过程中，学会了很多建设现代化桥梁的本领。
