Yumen Oilfield Increases Gasoline and Kerosene Production

The Yumen Mining Bureau's gasoline and kerosene products completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule on December 7th. Compared with 1954, gasoline production increased by 18.39%, and kerosene production increased by 16.57%. The quality of both products is qualified, and the unit cost has also been reduced.

This year, the Yumen Mining Bureau Refinery has greatly improved its refining capacity through continuous expansion and reconstruction, with an average increase of more than 22% compared with 1954.

This year, refinery workers extracted 9.7 kilograms more gasoline from one ton of crude oil than last year.

    玉门油矿汽油煤油产量增加
    玉门矿务局的汽油和煤油两种产品已经在十二月七日提前完成了全年生产计划。和一九五四年相比，汽油产量增加了百分之十八点三九，煤油产量增加了百分之十六点五七。这两种产品的质量都合格，单位成本也降低了。
    玉门矿务局炼油厂今年经过不断地扩建和改建，炼油能力有了很大提高，比一九五四年平均提高了百分之二十二以上。
    今年炼油工人从一吨原油里比去年多提炼出了九点七公斤的汽油。
