    Vast Numbers of Young People and Children in Rehe Province Actively Plant Trees and Create Forests
    The vast majority of young people and children in Rehe Province have participated in tree planting and afforestation activities. From 1954 to the autumn of 1955, an average of more than 1.2 million young people and children actively planted trees and created forests each year, successively building 1,354 "Youth Forests," covering an area of 25,076 mu, and planting more than 34,597,000 trees. In particular, after the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference proposed the "Three Types" initiative, the broad masses of young people responded enthusiastically. This year alone, in the autumn, 750 "Youth Forests" were built, covering an area of 15,320 mu, and more than 6,070,000 various trees were planted. Including decentralized afforestation, a total of 13,543,000 trees were planted.
    The Communist Youth League organizations in various counties and districts of Rehe Province have successively made plans for tree planting and afforestation. The province plans to build 3,878 "Youth Forests" in 1956 and 1957, covering an area of 99,318 mu, and plant 83,374,800 trees, including decentralized afforestation. At the same time, each region, according to different climates, specifically stipulated the "Afforestation Day" in spring and autumn each year.

    热河省绝大多数青年和少年都参加了植树造林活动。由一九五四年到一九五五年秋季，平均每年有一百二十多万青年和少年积极植树造林，先后营造了“青年林”一千三百五十四座，面积达二万五千零七十六亩，种植树木三千四百五十九万七千多棵。特别是全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会提出“三种”倡议后，广大青年纷纷响应，今年一个秋季就营造“青年林”七百五十座，面积一万五千三百二十亩，种植各种树木达六百零七万多棵，连分散造林在内共植树一千三百五十四万三千多棵。
    热河省各县区的青年团组织已先后作出了植树造林的规划。全省在一九五六、一九五七年两年内计划营造“青年林”三千八百七十八座，面积九万九千三百一十八亩，连分散造林在内要植树八千三百三十七万四千八百棵。同时各地根据不同气候，具体规定了每年春秋两季的“造林日”。
