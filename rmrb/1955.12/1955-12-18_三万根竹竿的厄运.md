    The Misfortune of 30,000 Bamboo Poles
    To the Editor:
    In 1953, the Liaodong Province First Engineering Company (now the Liaoning Province First Engineering Company) purchased 30,000 bamboo poles for scaffolding. Later, they discovered that the poles did not meet specifications and left them exposed outdoors for a long time. It wasn't until November 1954 that the company's Tool and Equipment Section entrusted the Andong City Trust Company Consignment Store to sell the batch of bamboo poles on consignment. After inquiring about the situation, the consignment store's salesperson realized that if they didn't sell them quickly, the bamboo poles would crack in the spring and become unusable. So they actively looked for buyers for the poles. It so happened that the Andong City Handicraft Production Cooperative needed a batch of bamboo poles at the time and was willing to buy them at the local listed price (80 cents per pole). Unexpectedly, Li, the section chief of the company's Tool and Equipment Section, even attempted to extract a hefty profit from these stockpiled materials, insisting on selling them for one yuan per pole. As a result, the 30,000 bamboo poles could not be sold and continued to be stockpiled.
    By this spring, the bamboo poles had already started to crack, but the relevant personnel of the company still did not try to find a solution. After a long period of sun, wind, and rain, all of the bamboo poles have now cracked, the outer skin has turned black, and some have already rotted, resulting in irreparable losses.

### 三万根竹竿的厄运

    三万根竹竿的厄运编辑同志：
    一九五三年，辽东省第一工程公司（就是现在的辽宁省第一工程公司）买进了三万根竹竿准备作脚手架；后来发觉不合规格，就长期搁在露天地里。直到一九五四年十一月，这个公司工具设备科才委托安东市信托公司寄卖商店代销这批竹竿。寄卖商店的推销员问清情况以后，知道如果不急速销售，到来年开春竹竿会裂口而不能使用了，就积极为竹竿找买主。恰好当时安东市手工业生产合作社需要一批竹竿，愿意按照当地牌价（每根八角钱）买这批货。出人意外的是，这个公司工具设备科的李科长竟然还企图从这批积压物资身上捞一笔优厚的利润，坚持要卖一元钱一根。于是，这三万根竹竿又卖不出去，继续积压着。
    到了今年春天，竹竿已经开始裂口了，公司的有关人员还不赶紧想办法。又经过长时期的日晒、风吹、雨淋，到现在这批竹竿已经全部裂了口，表皮变成黑色，有的已经腐烂了。造成了不可补偿的损失。
