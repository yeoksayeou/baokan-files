Xinhua News Agency, December 13th -- A learning culture craze has emerged in rural areas across the country. Currently, more than 45 million farmers nationwide are participating in various amateur cultural learning organizations.

    Peasant amateur schools in various parts of Sichuan Province have already started classes in early December, with a total of 7 million farmers participating in learning throughout the province. Wanxian originally planned to organize 75,000 people to study, but the number of students has already reached 100,000. Jianyang County originally planned to organize 60,000 people to study, but the number of farmers attending school has reached more than 226,000. Jiangxi Province planned to enroll one million farmers this year, and according to statistics from various places, the enrollment has exceeded the original plan. Fuzhou Prefecture planned to enroll 85,000 people, but it has now increased to 300,000. Amateur schools in various parts of Shandong Province have admitted 2.4 million young and middle-aged farmers to participate in learning, but farmers in various places are still continuing to register, and it is estimated that the number of students in the province will reach 4 million, an increase of more than 1.6 million over last year. The number of farmers planned to be organized for study in Hunan Province has also increased from 2.2 million to 3 million. The number of students enrolled in Liaoning, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have all exceeded the original plan. In some townships in the suburbs of Beijing, 90% of young and middle-aged illiterate people have gone to school.
    Among the farmers participating in learning in various places, more than 1.3 million farmers who have undergone literacy studies have entered higher elementary classes. Heilongjiang Province has 60,000 farmers attending spare-time higher elementary classes. Shanxi Province has nearly 100,000 young and middle-aged farmers entering higher elementary or junior high school classes.
    The existing educated youth in rural areas actively participate in literacy work. In Wendeng Prefecture, Shandong Province, 100,000 rural educated youths have organized voluntary literacy teams to serve as teachers and counselors in farmers' spare-time schools, workpoint literacy classes, and literacy groups in an organized and planned manner. In the three townships of Caobu Township, Hushan District, Kunyu County, more than 230 graduates of higher primary schools, under the leadership and assistance of the Youth League organization, established three literacy teams with the township as the unit, and divided into groups by village to closely cooperate with the farmers' spare-time schools to carry out work of ensuring teaching and learning. The Youth League branch of Jubao Village, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, mobilized 36 rural intellectuals to help village cadres become literate by using the method of ensuring teaching and learning. In Fuzhou Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, more than 800 volunteer teachers have guaranteed that each of them will organize 300 people to study this year and help them learn 500 characters within three months.
    Most of the farmers' amateur schools in various places are run by agricultural producers' cooperatives or based on agricultural producers' cooperatives. In Shanxi Province, 10,000 cooperatives have established amateur schools. Many newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives in Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and other provinces have also established amateur schools. In Bailong District, Dangchang County, Gansu Province, 390 members of eight agricultural producers' cooperatives not only actively participated in learning themselves, but also drove more than 600 farmers outside the cooperatives to go to school.
