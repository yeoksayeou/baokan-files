Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd:

    The Ministry of Heavy Industry system has established central laboratories or laboratories responsible for scientific experimental research work in sixty-seven production enterprises this year. Together with the laboratories established in the past few years, most of the production enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry have scientific experimental research institutions. In addition, the four industrial bureaus under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, namely, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical industry, and building materials, have also established comprehensive scientific research institutes that research and test major production technology issues in their respective industrial systems. The number of laboratories under these four comprehensive research institutes has increased from more than ten in 1952 to more than thirty; scientific research and testing equipment has also increased significantly.

    The technical strength of the scientific experimental research institutions under the Ministry of Heavy Industry is growing year by year. Among them, the number of technical personnel in the four comprehensive research institutes has increased by more than 60% compared with 1954, and about three times compared with 1952; the number of technical personnel in the central laboratories or laboratories of various production enterprises has increased significantly compared with 1954. The technical level of scientific researchers has also improved significantly.

    In order to further improve and strengthen the scientific experimental research work of production enterprises, the Ministry of Heavy Industry recently convened a scientific experimental research work conference for production enterprises, and will formulate measures to strengthen the planning and leadership of scientific experimental research work in the future.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: The scientific experimental research institutions of the production system under the Ministry of Heavy Industry have played an important role in improving the production technology level of enterprises.

    Since the beginning of this year, the comprehensive research institutes and central laboratories of production enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry have conducted a lot of experimental research work in researching and promoting new technologies and improving enterprise production. This year, the Non-ferrous Metals Industry Comprehensive Research Institute helped a mine solve the problem of excessive lead content in molybdenum concentrate, so that the quality of molybdenum concentrate reached international standards. With the close cooperation of the production department, the Central Laboratory of Anshan Iron and Steel Company successfully researched and trial-produced a large ductile iron roll this year. The service life of this roll is one and a half times longer than that of the cast iron or cast steel rolls used by Chinese steel mills in the past. The Central Laboratory of Anshan Iron and Steel Company also helped the production department improve the quality of many products. For example, the physical properties of medium and heavy steel plates for construction have not met the requirements for a long time. Later, after research and testing by experimental personnel, and with the assistance of workers, improvements were made in controlling chemical composition and rolling temperature. At present, the average qualified rate of physical properties of medium and heavy steel plates has increased by more than 10% compared with last year. The Building Materials Industry Comprehensive Research Institute successfully researched and tested standard sand for testing cement quality this year, which is of great significance for improving the quality of cement in my country. At present, relevant units are building a factory to produce standard sand.

    The comprehensive research institutes and some central laboratories have also assisted the production departments in researching and trial-producing many technically complex new products. The Chemical Industry Comprehensive Research Institute has successfully researched more than 40 new products this year, and a total of 125 new products, including high-grade paints, plastics, dyes, and fertilizers, have been successfully researched and trial-produced in the past few years. The Steel Industry Comprehensive Research Institute and the central laboratories of some steel enterprises have also cooperated with the production departments to research and trial-produce many new products. The central laboratory of a steel plant in Northeast China alone has assisted the production unit in trial-producing more than ten new products this year. Most of the new types of cement, such as bauxite cement, plugging cement, and clinker-free cement, successfully trial-produced by the building materials industry department, and some new products successfully trial-produced by the non-ferrous metal industry department this year, were also manufactured after repeated research and experimentation by scientific experimental research institutions and production workshops.

    The scientific experimental research institutions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system have also done a lot of valuable experimental research work in the rational utilization of national resources. The Non-ferrous Metals Industry Comprehensive Research Institute and the laboratories of certain factories have successfully researched the recovery of nickel from miscellaneous copper and the recovery of other precious metals from zinc oxide this year. In the past, these precious metals were thrown away like waste. The Central Laboratory of Yongli Jiuda Chemical Industry Company’s Gu Factory has successfully tested the use of white coal to replace coke for calcining lime. After this method is adopted, it can save the country a lot of coke.

    重工业部建立一批科学研究机构
    对提高企业生产技术水平起了重要作用
    据新华社三日讯  重工业部系统今年有六十七个生产企业建立了担负本企业科学试验研究工作的中央试验室或试验室。连同过去几年来建立的试验室在内，重工业部所属的大部分生产企业都有了科学试验研究机构。此外，重工业部所属钢铁、有色金属、化学、建筑材料等四个工业管理局，也设立了研究试验本产业系统重大生产技术问题的综合性科学研究所。这四个综合研究所所属的试验室，已经由一九五二年的十多个增加到三十多个；科学研究试验设备也增加了很多。
    重工业部所属各科学试验研究机构的技术力量，一年比一年增长。其中四个综合研究所现有技术人员比一九五四年增加了百分之六十以上，比一九五二年增加了二倍左右；各生产企业的中央试验室或试验室，现有技术人员比一九五四年增加了很多。科学研究人员的技术水平也有显著提高。
    重工业部为了进一步改进和加强生产企业科学试验研究工作，最近召开了生产企业科学试验研究工作会议，对今后的科学试验研究工作将作出加强规划和加强领导的措施。
    据新华社三日讯重工业部所属生产系统的科学试验研究机构，在提高企业生产技术水平方面起了重要作用。
    重工业部所属各综合研究所和生产企业中央试验室，今年以来在研究和推广新技术、改善企业生产等方面作了很多试验研究工作。有色金属工业综合研究所今年帮助一个矿山解决了钼精矿含铅过高的问题，使钼精矿的质量达到了国际标准。鞍山钢铁公司中央试验室在生产部门密切配合下，今年研究试制成功了一种大型球墨铸铁轧辊，这种轧辊的使用寿命比中国各轧钢厂过去使用的铸铁或铸钢轧辊能延长一倍半。鞍山钢铁公司中央试验室还帮助生产部门提高了不少产品的质量。如建筑用的中厚钢板，很长时期以来物理性能不合要求，后来经过试验人员研究试验，协助工人从控制化学成份和轧制温度等方面作了改进，目前中厚钢板的物理性能合格率已平均比去年提高了百分之十以上。建筑材料工业综合研究所今年研究试验成功了检验水泥质量用的标准沙，对改进我国水泥质量有很大意义。目前，有关单位正在建设生产标准沙的工厂。
    各综合研究所和一些中央试验室还协助生产部门研究试制成功了许多技术复杂的新产品，化学工业综合研究所今年研究成功的新产品有四十多种，连同过去几年来研究试制成功的新产品在内，共有一百二十五种。其中包括高级油漆、塑料、染料和肥料。钢铁工业综合研究所和一些钢铁企业中央试验室，配合生产部门研究试制成功的新产品也很多，仅东北某一钢厂中央试验室今年协助生产单位试制成功的新产品就有十多种。建筑材料工业部门试制成功的矾土水泥、堵塞水泥、无熟料水泥等新品种水泥以及有色金属工业部门今年试制成功的一些新产品，大多数也是经过科学试验研究机构协助生产车间反复研究试验才制造成功的。
    重工业部系统的科学试验研究机构在合理利用国家资源方面也作了许多有价值的试验研究工作。有色金属工业综合研究所和某些厂的试验室，今年研究从杂铜中回收镍、从氧化锌中回收其他贵重金属的试验，都已经成功。过去这些贵重金属都像废物一样扔掉了。永利久大化学工业公司沽厂中央试验室试验成功用白煤代替焦炭锻烧石灰，这个方法采用后能为国家节省许多焦炭。
