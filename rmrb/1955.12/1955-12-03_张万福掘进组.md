    Zhang Wanfu Tunneling Team

    The Zhang Wanfu rapid tunneling team of Datong Coal Mine completed its 1955 tunneling plan ahead of schedule on October 14. There are many reasons for completing the plan ahead of schedule, among which the most prominent are the team's strengthening of unity and cooperation and learning from advanced experience.
    In coal mine tunneling work, the unity and cooperation of tunneling workers and transport workers is an important guarantee for overfulfilling the production plan. In Datong Coal Mine, some tunneling teams' tunneling workers and transport workers do not help each other. The reason is that tunneling workers are afraid that helping transport workers will affect tunneling, and transport workers are also afraid that helping tunneling workers will affect transport. This is not the case in the Zhang Wanfu tunneling team. Whenever the transport work cannot keep up with the tunneling, the tunneling workers help shovel coal and load cars after blasting; if the drilling workers lack explosives and stemming, the transport workers bring the explosives and stemming to the drilling workers when transporting coal. Transport worker Chen Ru said, "Some teams' transport workers are unwilling to send stemming and explosives to the drilling workers, believing that this will reduce the amount of coal transported by one or two cars per day. However, they didn't think that if the transport workers didn't help deliver stemming and explosives, and the drilling workers had to personally fetch them from the working face through hundreds of meters of roadway, then one less blasting would be done per shift, and a dozen fewer cars of coal would be produced. Which is more, a dozen cars of coal or two cars of coal?"
    The workers of the Zhang Wanfu team attach great importance to learning advanced experience and improving operating techniques. In the first quarter, after the drilling workers further promoted the advanced experience of "relay slotting," the number of cycles increased. At this time, the transport workers were still using the old transport methods. In this way, more coal was extracted, but it could not be transported out, and further extraction was useless, so the overall tunneling efficiency could not be improved. Therefore, the transport workers collectively researched and changed the single-ended turnout to a loop turnout, reducing the time for empty and loaded cars (coal cars) to pass each other in the middle lane, effectively improving vehicle turnover and solving the problem of transport not keeping up with tunneling. In April, they created a record of advancing 813 meters per month.
    In order to more effectively solve the old problem of transport not keeping up with tunneling, they also promoted segmented cyclical transport. The advantage of this transport method is that the workers only push heavy cars for a short distance, which is then transferred to the next section of workers, who connect the empty cars sent by the next section of workers and send them in. In this way, the workers save energy and can work non-stop. At the same time, they also rationally allocate labor organization, with old workers and new workers, strong and weak abilities matched with each other, which not only improved efficiency but also cultivated technical strength.
    The roadway where the Zhang Wanfu team is located this year has a lot of water. Some roadways use three 15-horsepower water pumps to pump water, and the working face often has water. The workers work in the water for a long time, but they still maintain a normal attendance rate, ensuring that they overfulfill the production plan every month. In the first quarter of this year, their team completed 113 percent of the plan, and in the third quarter, they completed 132 percent of the plan. The highest monthly footage reached 874 meters.

    张万福掘进组

    大同煤矿张万福快速掘进组，已于十月十四日提前完成了一九五五年掘进计划。提前完成计划的原因是多方面的，其中比较突出的就是全组加强团结协作和学习先进经验。
    在煤矿掘进工作中，掘进工人和运搬工人的团结协作，是超额完成生产计划的一项重要保证。在大同煤矿，有些掘进组的掘进工人和运搬工人互不帮助。原因是：掘进工人怕帮助运搬工人以后影响掘进，而运搬工人也怕帮助掘进工人以后影响运搬。在张万福掘进组里，就不是这样。他们每当运搬工作赶不上掘进了，掘进工人就在放完炮后帮助铲煤装车；打眼工人缺乏炮药和炮土，运搬工人就在运煤的时候，把炮药和炮土捎给掘进工人。运搬工人陈儒说：“有些组的运搬工人不愿给掘进工人送炮土和炮药，认为这样每天要少运一、二车煤。但是，他们没想到如果运搬工人不帮助送炮土和炮药，而要打眼工人从工作面经过几百公尺的巷道亲自去取的话，那末每班就要少打一庄炮，少出十几车煤。十几车煤多呢，还是两车煤多？”
    张万福小组的工人们非常重视学习先进经验和改进操作技术。在第一季度，打眼工人进一步推广“接力掏槽”的先进经验以后，提高了循环次数，这时，运搬工人还用旧的运搬方法。这样，打下的煤多了，运不出去，再打也不顶事，因而整个掘进效率就不能提高。于是，运搬工人们便集体研究，把独头道叉改为环行道叉，减去了空车和重车（装煤车）在中道错车时间，有效地提高了车辆周转率，解决了运搬赶不上掘进的问题，四月份便创造了月进八百十三公尺的纪录。
    为了更有效地解决运搬赶不上掘进这个老问题，他们又推行了分段循环运搬。这种运搬方法的好处是，工人只推短距离的重车，即转换给下一段工人，接上下一段工人送上来的空车往里送，这样工人便省了劲，可以不间息地进行工作。与此同时，他们还合理地调配劳力组织，老工人和新工人，能力强的和能力弱的互相搭配，既提高了效率，还培养了技术力量。
    张万福小组今年所在的巷道，水很大，有的巷道用三个十五马力的水泵抽水，工作面还经常有水。工人们长时间浸在水中工作，但是，他们还保持了正常的出勤率，保证了月月超额完成生产计划。今年第一季他们组完成了计划的百分之一百十三，第三季度完成了计划的百分之一百三十二。最高月进尺达到八百七十四公尺。
