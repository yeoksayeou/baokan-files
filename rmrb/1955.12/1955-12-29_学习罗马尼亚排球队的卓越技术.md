    Learning the Excellent Techniques of the Romanian Volleyball Team
    Gu Hua
    The Romanian National Men's Volleyball Team has come to our country for a visit, bringing with them the profound friendship of the Romanian people and athletes. The Chinese people and athletes have received this fraternal team with sincerity and warmth.
    In the three friendly matches in Beijing, the Romanian National Volleyball Team fully expressed the fraternal friendship of the Romanian people and athletes towards the Chinese people and athletes, and fully demonstrated their excellent techniques in volleyball.
    Judging from the three matches, this team has a solid foundation in fighting spirit, offense, defense, on-the-spot observation, and cooperation. First of all, it can be seen that they attach great importance to serving. In the first game against the Central Institute of Physical Education volleyball team and the second game against the "August 1st" volleyball team, they rarely served hard balls, generally serving safe balls. However, when they spotted the opponent's weakness, such as in the second game against the Central Institute of Physical Education team and against the Northeast Institute of Physical Education team, Roman (No. 1) and Bonova (No. 6) served rapid and powerful hard balls, making serving an important component of their offense. This not only avoids losing scoring opportunities but also creates opportunities to score. The most prominent aspect of their offense is spiking. The Romanian National Volleyball Team's fierce spiking is well-known internationally, and this characteristic was clearly demonstrated in the matches in Beijing. Several spiking experts, such as captain Roman Stefan (No. 1), players Nicolau Horatiu (No. 2), Medianu Dumitru (No. 4), and Rusescu Marcel (No. 7), delivered rapid and hard spikes in several matches, making it difficult for the opponent to receive. Roman and Rusescu's overhand spikes fell almost vertically. In addition, their far-net and twist spikes are also very good. They also often use spread tactics, spreading out over a large distance, to attack when the opponent's defensive strength cannot be concentrated. Another characteristic of their offense is double spiking. Their first pass is very accurate, and the second pass is used to spike the ball fiercely, making it difficult for the opponent to judge the direction and defend effectively. When the opponent jumps up to block, they cleverly switch to spread tactics, taking advantage of the opening to spike fiercely. These are all worthy of our learning and diligent practice. In defense, the Romanian team often uses two players to block simultaneously, preventing the opponent's offense and breaking free from a passive situation. In the matches, they blocked many of the opponent's spikes. Their low-hand save technique is also very good, not only saving many dangerous balls but also using the saved balls to smoothly organize the offense. Their calmness, strength, and quick reaction in defense are also worth our learning.
    Romanian international referee Sotir Nicola served as the referee for the third match. Although the game was relatively short, Sotir Nicola's serious attitude, accurate judgments, and clear gestures won unanimous praise from the audience.
    The Romanian National Volleyball Team's matches in Beijing left a deep and unforgettable impression on more than 10,000 spectators and countless millions of listeners through radio broadcasts. At the same time, it provided a good examination of our country's volleyball.
    Judging from the three teams that played against them, the "August 1st" volleyball team's performance was satisfactory. The victory of the "August 1st" team is not only a victory for the "August 1st" team this time but also shows that our country's volleyball team can compete with volleyball teams that have a high reputation internationally. The "August 1st" volleyball team's victory also shows that as long as you train hard in peacetime, actively strive for victory in the competition, and compete resolutely, tenaciously, intelligently, and unitedly, it is not difficult to achieve victory and catch up with international standards. The victory of the "August 1st" team is by no means accidental. I hope they continue to work hard, avoid arrogance and rashness, and achieve better results. The Central Institute of Physical Education volleyball team cannot but be criticized in this competition. In the first two games, they showed a cowardly and fearful attitude and lacked a tenacious fighting spirit. It is almost unbelievable that this is one of the best teams in the country, having been established for many years, frequently traveling abroad, and knowing the situation of the Romanian team well (they had played against the Romanian team twice). People have reason to demand that the Central Institute of Physical Education Men's Volleyball Team seriously accept this lesson and show better results. The Northeast Institute of Physical Education volleyball team should also summarize experience from this competition and further improve their skills and cultivate a brave and tenacious fighting spirit.
    Let us, from the visit of the Romanian National Volleyball Team, further enhance the close fraternal friendship between the people and athletes of China and Romania, learn excellent volleyball techniques, and strive to further develop volleyball and improve technical levels.

    学习罗马尼亚排球队的卓越技术 
    顾华
    罗马尼亚国家男子排球队带着罗马尼亚人民和运动员的深厚友谊来到了我国访问。中国人民和运动员以真诚、热烈的心情接待了这个兄弟球队。
    罗马尼亚国家排球队在北京的三场友谊比赛中，充分表达了罗马尼亚人民和运动员对中国人民和运动员的兄弟般的亲切友谊，充分表现了他们在排球运动中的卓越技术。
    从三场比赛看来，这支球队无论在战斗意志，进攻，防守，临场观察、合作上都具有深厚基础。首先可以看出他们很重视发球。在第一场同中央体育学院排球队比赛的第一局和第二场同“八一”排球队的比赛中，他们很少发硬球，一般都是发保险球，而当他们看准了对方的弱点，如在对中央体育学院队第二局以后，以及对东北体育学院队的时候，一号罗曼、六号波诺瓦就发出了急骤而强劲的硬球，将发球作为进攻的重要组成部分。这样既可以避免失去得分的机会，同时又可相机得分。他们在进攻中最突出的是扣杀。罗马尼亚国家排球队扣杀的猛烈在国际上是早已驰名的，这次在北京的比赛也明显地表现了这一特点。几个扣杀能手如队长一号罗曼·斯特凡，队员二号尼柯劳·霍拉蒂尤，四号梅迪亚努·杜米特鲁，七号鲁谢斯库·马切尔，在几场比赛中扣杀的又急又硬的球使对方很难接起。罗曼和鲁谢斯库的超手扣球，几乎垂直落下。此外，他们的远网和转体扣杀等技术也很好。他们还常用拉开战术，拉开的距离很远，乘对方防守力量不能集中时进攻。在进攻中的另一个特点是两次扣球。他们第一传很准确，第二次就将球猛烈地扣杀过去，这样就使对方来不及判清方向，很难防守；而当对方跳起拦网时，他们又机智地改用拉开战术，乘虚猛烈扣杀。这些都是值得我们学习和认真锻炼的。在防守上，罗马尼亚队经常两人同时拦网，阻止对方的进攻，摆脱被动的局面。在比赛中，他们关死了许多对方的扣杀球。他们低手救球的技术也很好，不但救起了很多险球，而且还能利用救起的球顺利地组织进攻。他们在防守中的镇定、坚强、反应迅速等等也都是值得我们学习的。
    罗马尼亚国际裁判索蒂尔·尼古拉担任了第三场比赛的裁判。这场球赛进行时间虽然较短，但是索蒂尔·尼古拉的严肃的态度，准确的判断，明晰的手势，博得观众一致好评。
    罗马尼亚国家排球队在北京的比赛，给一万多观众以及通过广播的数不清的千万个听众留下了深刻的难忘的印象；同时也对我国排球运动作了一次良好的检验。
    从迎战的三个球队看来，“八一”排球队的成绩是令人满意的。“八一”队的获胜，不仅是“八一”球队的这一次的胜利，而且说明了我国排球队能够和国际上素负崇高声誉的排球队相抗衡。“八一”排球队的获胜，还说明了只要平时艰苦锻炼，在比赛时积极争取胜利，坚决、顽强、机智、团结地进行比赛，就不难获得胜利，也不难赶上国际水平。“八一”队的胜利决不是偶然的。希望他们继续努力，戒骄戒躁，取得更好的成绩。中央体育学院排球队在这次比赛中不能不受到指责和批评。在前两局中，表现了懦弱畏惧的情绪，没有顽强的战斗意志。几乎令人不能相信这是建队多年、经常出国、深知罗马尼亚队情况（他们曾和罗马尼亚队比赛过两次）的全国最好球队之一。人们有理由要求中央体育学院男子排球队认真地接受这次教训，表现出更好的成绩来。东北体育学院排球队也应从这次比赛中总结经验，进一步提高技术和培养勇敢顽强的战斗意志。
    让我们从罗马尼亚国家排球队的来访，进一步增进中罗两国人民和运动员亲密的兄弟般的友谊，学习优秀的排球运动技术，为进一步开展排球运动，提高技术水平而努力。
