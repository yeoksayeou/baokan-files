    Benson's Dilemma

    Not long ago, United Press reporter Wilson sent a message from Washington saying that the problem of corn and hog prices caused a "serious dispute" within the Eisenhower administration. Vice President Nixon, Attorney General Brownell, and Postmaster General Summerfield personally stepped in and demanded that Agriculture Secretary Benson "take action quickly." But Benson "remained unmoved."

    In Wilson's words, American farmers are now suffering from "price torture." He said: "Farmers' costs remain high. But at the same time, they are getting less and less money from what they produce and sell. The situation is especially true for agricultural machinery and hogs." This indeed illustrates the actual situation of American farmers today.

    According to materials published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture: In the first nine months of this year, American farmers' cash income from the sale of various agricultural products decreased by 4 percent compared with the same period last year. While farmers' cash income decreased, their production costs further increased. This year, farmers' net income after deducting production costs and taxes decreased by 10 percent compared with last year. However, consumers have not benefited from a corresponding decrease in agricultural product prices.

    According to Wilson, in resolving this problem, Nixon and others, posing as "representatives" of hog producers, demanded that Agriculture Secretary Benson "take out a portion of the large amount of unallocated funds under his control to rescue corn and hog producers." Benson, however, believed that "the time has not yet come." He said: "Only when hog prices fall further can the government smoothly intervene."

    Because the two sides "could not agree," President Eisenhower, who was recuperating in Denver, had to issue an "unusual statement" from his sickbed to support Benson's agricultural policy, which put an end to the dispute.

    Wilson pointed out why Nixon and others are particularly interested in safeguarding the interests of corn and hog producers: The corn and hog producers and the states in the Midwest that produce corn and hogs have long been the "cornerstone" of the Republican political machine. Now, "the plummeting prices of pork and lard have shaken this foundation and machine like the sky is falling." Next year is the U.S. presidential election year, and in order to deceive farmers and voters in this region into supporting them in the upcoming election, the Republican Party has to come out and "force Agriculture Secretary Benson to show his cards."

    It would be wrong to say that Agriculture Secretary Benson does not understand this point. But the U.S. government now has more than $7 billion worth of surplus agricultural products in stock. Benson recently said that the "large surplus" of agricultural products in the government's hands has given us a "heavy burden and also exposed us to serious market problems." In September this year, he personally went to Europe to try to sell some of the surplus agricultural products, but the sales problem was still not easy to solve. Although Benson also knows the importance of garnering votes for the Republican Party, his heart is willing but his strength is insufficient. This is Benson's dilemma.

### 本逊的苦衷

    本逊的苦衷
    不久以前，合众社记者威尔逊从华盛顿发出的一个消息说，玉蜀黍和毛猪价格问题在艾森豪威尔政府内部引起了一场“严重的纠纷”。副总统尼克松、司法部长布郎纳尔和邮政总长萨末菲尔德等人亲自出马，要求农业部长本逊“赶快采取行动”。但是本逊“却始终不动声色”。
    用威尔逊的话说，美国农民现在正受着“价格的煎熬”。他说：“农民的成本仍然很高。但同时他们从他们所生产及出售的东西中得到的钱却愈来愈少。对农业机器和毛猪来说，情况特别如此。”这的确说明了美国农民目前的实际情况。
    据美国农业部发表的材料：在今年头九个月，美国农民从出售各种农产品所获的现金收入比去年同期减少百分之四。在农民现金收入减少的同时，农民的生产费用更加提高了。今年农民在扣除生产费用和纳税后的净收入比去年减少百分之十。但是消费者却并没有由于农产品价格相应降低而得到一些好处。
    据威尔逊说，在解决这个问题时，尼克松等以毛猪生产者的“代表”自居，要求农业部长本逊“拿出他支配下的一大笔未分配的基金的一部分，来解救玉蜀黍、毛猪生产者”。而本逊认为“这个时间还没有到。”他说：“只有毛猪价格再下跌时，政府才能顺利地插足干涉。”
    由于双方“争执不下”，迫使在丹佛养病的艾森豪威尔总统不得不从病床上发表了一篇“不寻常的声明”来支持本逊的农业政策，才算把这场纠纷平息下来。
    威尔逊指出了为什么尼克松等对维护玉蜀黍和毛猪生产者的利益特别有兴趣：原来玉蜀黍、毛猪生产者和中西部出产玉蜀黍和毛猪的各个州，很久以来就是共和党政治机构的“基石”。现在，“猪肉和猪油跌价已天塌地崩似地动摇了这个基础和机构”。明年正是美国总统选举年，共和党为了在未来竞选中骗取这个地区农民选民的支持，就不得不出来“迫使农业部长本逊摊牌”。
    要说农业部长本逊不了解到这一点，那是冤枉了他。但是现在美国政府手里积存的剩余农产品价值已达七十多亿美元。本逊最近说，政府手中“大批剩余”农产品给了我们“沉重的负担，还使我们遇到严重的市场问题。”今年九月间他亲自前往欧洲设法推销一部分剩余农产品，但销路问题仍旧不易解决，本逊虽然也知道替共和党拉选票的重要性，但是毕竟心有余而力不足。这就是本逊的苦衷。　（林）
