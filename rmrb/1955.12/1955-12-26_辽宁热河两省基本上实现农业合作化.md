Liaoning and Rehe Provinces Basically Achieve Agricultural Cooperation

The agricultural cooperation movement in Liaoning Province is developing rapidly. As of December 20, the number of farmer households joining cooperatives in the province has reached approximately 2 million, accounting for over 84% of the total number of farmer households. The province has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperation. In thirteen counties, the number of farmer households joining cooperatives has reached over 90% of the total number of farmer households in the county. Nearly 400,000 farmer households in the province have joined advanced agricultural production cooperatives; it is expected that by the end of the year, the number of farmer households joining advanced cooperatives will account for over 15% of the total number of farmer households in the province.

In the high tide of agricultural cooperation, many areas have seen entire villages and districts of farmers joining cooperatives, and are beginning to develop towards the advanced stage. It is estimated that by the beginning of January next year, in Kangping and Yi counties, over 70% of the total number of farmer households will have joined advanced cooperatives, basically achieving complete socialist agricultural cooperation. In Gaiping, Fuxian, Yingkou, and Kuandian counties, the number of farmer households joining cooperatives has accounted for 90% to 97% of the total number of farmer households, and the number of farmer households transferring to advanced cooperatives has reached over half of the total number of farmer households. In the Bahechuan district of Kuandian County, the number of farmer households participating in advanced cooperatives has reached 98% of the total number of farmer households in the district. The scale of agricultural cooperatives has also expanded compared to before, and in many areas, most agricultural cooperatives already have one to two hundred households. Some areas have also seen the emergence of large cooperatives with around a thousand households.

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Rehe Province has basically achieved agricultural cooperation of a semi-socialist nature. As of mid-December, more than 293,800 farmer households in the province have joined the newly established 14,100 agricultural production cooperatives, and more than 119,700 farmer households have participated in old cooperatives; adding more than 27,000 farmer households who are establishing new cooperatives and the number of members of the original 13,100 cooperatives, the number of farmer households joining cooperatives has reached more than 717,000, accounting for 72.28% of the total number of farmer households in the province. It is expected that before the spring plowing next year, the number of farmer households joining cooperatives will account for at least 75% of the total number of farmer households.

In the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement in Rehe Province this winter, not only a large number of poor and lower-middle peasants actively demanded to establish and join cooperatives, but many upper-middle peasants also saw that agricultural production cooperatives "do a good job in production and do not harm anyone," and actively demanded to join cooperatives. Many old cooperatives merged into large cooperatives during this period; some old cooperatives also demanded to be converted into advanced cooperatives of a completely socialist nature. It is estimated that before the spring plowing next year, the province will establish 386 large cooperatives with more than 100 households and more than 200 advanced cooperatives.

    辽宁热河两省基本上实现农业合作化
    辽宁省的农业合作化运动发展迅速。到十二月二十日，全省入社农户已约有二百万户，达到总农户的百分之八十四以上。全省已经基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。十三个县入社的农户已经达到全县总农户的百分之九十以上。全省加入高级农业生产合作社的农户已近四十万户；预计到年底，加入高级社的农户将占全省总农户的百分之十五以上。
    在农业合作化高潮中，不少地区出现了整村、整区农民全部入社的情况，并且开始向高级阶段发展。康平、义县预计到明年一月初，可以有占总农户百分之七十以上的农户加入高级社，基本上实现完全社会主义的农业合作化。盖平、复县、营口、宽甸等四县，入社农户已占总农户的百分之九十到九十七，其中转入高级社的农户都已经达到总农户的一半以上。宽甸县八河川区参加高级社的农户已经达全区总农户的百分之九十八。农业合作社的规模也都比以前扩大，许多地区的农业合作社大部分已经是一二百户的社。有些地区还出现了一些千户左右的大社。

      热河省已经基本上实现了半社会主义性质的农业合作化。到十二月中旬止，全省有二十九万三千八百多户农民加入了新建立的一万四千一百多个农业生产合作社，并且有十一万九千七百多户农民参加了老社；加上正在建立新社的二万七千多户农民和原有一万三千一百多个社的社员户数，入社农户已经达到七十一万七千多户，占全省农户总数的百分之七十二点二八。预计到明年春耕以前，入社农户最低限度将占农户总数的百分之七十五以上。
    热河省在今年冬季农业合作化运动的高潮中，不仅大批贫农、下中农积极要求建社入社，不少上中农看到农业生产合作社“生产搞得好，办事不亏人”，也主动要求入社。许多老社在这个时期纷纷并成大社；有些老社还要求转为完全社会主义性质的高级社。预计到明年春耕以前，全省将办起三百八十六个百户以上的大社和二百个以上的高级社。
