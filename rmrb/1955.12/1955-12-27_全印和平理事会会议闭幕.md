Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 26th. The All India Peace Council meeting, which began on December 23rd, closed on December 25th. The meeting passed a letter to Prime Minister Nehru, as well as resolutions on disarmament, on Asian unity and security, and welcoming negotiations to end the Malayan War.

    In its letter to Nehru, the meeting pledged to bring the message of the Soviet-Indian joint statement to all parts of India. The letter stated: Hundreds of millions of people in India support peace. They will do their best to support all the steps you take in the coming years to secure the People's Republic of China's legitimate place in the United Nations Organization, to meet the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights over Taiwan, to resolve the Korean issue, to implement the Geneva Accords on Indochina, to condemn the organization of military alliances and blocs, to reduce armaments, and to make 1956 a year of further victories in the struggle for peace.

    The resolution on disarmament welcomed the statements on disarmament in the Soviet-Indian joint statement. The resolution stated that if the major powers make determined efforts, the obstacles to reaching a final agreement on disarmament can be overcome. The resolution called for a complete ban on the use, manufacture, and testing of nuclear weapons, the limitation, regulation, and substantial reduction of all armed forces and all conventional armaments, the establishment of effective international supervision to ensure the effective implementation of agreed agreements on the reduction of armaments and weapons, and to ensure that atomic energy is used only for peaceful purposes.

    The resolution on Asian unity and security stated that collective peace in Asia and the Pacific region can be guaranteed by concluding a collective peace treaty. The resolution expressed full support for the proposal to convene a conference similar to the Geneva Conference, attended by the heads of government of the countries concerned, to resolve the issue of easing tensions in Asia. The resolution added: Such a conference must have broad participation from Asian countries, and it will pave the way for genuine peace, freedom, and security in Asia.

    The resolution also condemned the policy of forming military blocs and concluding military treaties. The resolution stated that this policy has reached a new stage with the conclusion of the Baghdad Pact and the open interference in the internal affairs of West Asian countries. The resolution stated: Taiwan continues to be a foreign base, and it is being forced not to return to the embrace of its motherland, the People's Republic of China; foreign armies and navies are stationed in and around Taiwan, these are the root causes of the continued tension in the East.

    In another resolution, the All India Peace Council meeting welcomed the proposed negotiations to end the Malayan War, and hoped that such negotiations would lead to a peaceful settlement acceptable to all parties. The resolution also condemned those who are trying to turn Malaya into a war base for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    The meeting condemned the recent joint communiqué issued by US Secretary of State Dulles and Portuguese Foreign Minister Cunha. The meeting pointed out that Portugal's continued occupation of colonies on Indian territory "seriously threatens the sovereignty and peace of the Indian people."

    The meeting also passed a resolution welcoming the recent trade agreement between India and the Soviet Union, and expressed its pleasure at the growing trade between India and China, other Asian and African countries, and Eastern European countries based on the principles of mutual benefit, equality, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The resolution stated that India should accept foreign investment based on the above principles, and that this investment should be used to develop heavy industry, while its use should be concentrated in the hands of Indians. The resolution stated: "Trade and economic relations between all countries based on the above approach will not only contribute greatly to the development of our independent national economy, but will also contribute to the further easing of international tensions and can promote cooperation among all countries and maintain world peace."

    In summarizing the three-day meeting, All India Peace Council General Secretary Chandra called on all peace fighters to launch a powerful movement for disarmament.

    全印和平理事会会议闭幕
    新华社新德里二十六日电　十二月二十三日开始举行的全印和平理事会会议已经在二十五日闭幕。会议通过了致尼赫鲁总理的信以及关于裁军的决议、关于亚洲团结和安全的决议和欢迎举行谈判以结束马来亚战争的决议等。
    会议在致尼赫鲁的信中保证将苏印联合声明的信息带到全印度各地。这封信写道：印度数亿人民拥护和平。他们将尽力支持你在未来年月中采取的一切步骤，以便使中华人民共和国取得它在联合国组织中的合法地位、满足中华人民共和国对台湾的合法权利、解决朝鲜问题、履行关于印度支那的日内瓦协定、谴责组织军事联盟和集团、裁减军备，并且使一九五六年成为在争取和平方面获得进一步胜利的一年。
    关于裁军的决议对苏印联合声明中关于裁军的主张表示欢迎。这项决议说，如果大国作坚定的努力，妨碍就裁军问题达成最后协议的障碍是可以克服的。决议要求完全禁止使用、制造和试验核子武器，限制、调整和大大裁减一切武装部队和一切常规军备，建立有效的国际监督以保证有效地履行一致同意的关于裁减军备和武器的协议并且保证原子能只用于和平的目的。
    关于亚洲团结和安全的决议说，亚洲和太平洋地区的集体和平可以通过缔结集体和平公约而得到保证。决议表示完全支持关于召开类似日内瓦会议的、由有关国家的政府首脑参加的会议来解决缓和亚洲紧张局势问题的建议。决议又说：这种会议必须有亚洲国家广泛参加，它将为亚洲的真正和平、自由和安全铺平道路。
    这项决议还指责结成军事集团和缔结军事条约的政策。决议说，这种政策随着巴格达条约的缔结和对西亚国家内政的公开干涉而达到了新的阶段。决议说：台湾继续成为外国的基地，它并且被迫不能重新回到它的祖国——中华人民共和国——的怀抱，外国的陆军和海军驻扎在台湾和台湾附近水面，这些是东方局势继续紧张的根源。
    全印和平理事会会议在另一项决议中欢迎拟议中的关于结束马来亚战争的谈判，并且希望这种谈判将导致为各方面都能接受的和平解决。这项决议还谴责那些企图把马来亚变为东南亚条约组织的战争基地的阴谋。
    会议谴责美国国务卿杜勒斯和葡萄牙外交部长库纳最近发表的联合公报。会议指出，葡萄牙继续盘踞在印度领土上的殖民地“非常严重地威胁着印度人民的主权和和平”。
    会议还通过决议，欢迎印度同苏联最近缔结的贸易协定，并且对于印度同中国、其他亚非国家和东欧国家之间的基于互利、平等和互不干涉彼此的内政的原则的贸易日益增长的情况表示高兴。决议谈到印度应当根据上述原则接受外国投资，这种投资应当被用来发展重工业，同时它的使用应当集中在印度人手中。决议说：“所有国家之间以上述方针为基础的贸易和经济关系不仅在很大的程度上有助于我们独立的国民经济的发展，同时也有助于国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，能够促进世界各国之间的合作和保持世界和平。”
    全印和平理事会总书记钱德拉在总结三天的会议时号召全体和平战士发动一个争取裁减军备的强有力的运动。
