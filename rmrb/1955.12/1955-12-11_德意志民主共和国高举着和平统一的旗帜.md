    The German Democratic Republic Holds High the Banner of Peaceful Reunification
    Tan Wenrui
    The recently concluded Four Foreign Ministers' Conference not only revealed to the people of the world the fundamental obstacles hindering the peaceful resolution of the German question, but also clearly showed where the realistic path to reunifying Germany lies. Now anyone can understand that Germany must be reunified, and it certainly can be reunified, but Germany's unification can only be achieved on a basis of peace and democracy. Any attempt to mechanically merge Germany's existing two parts into a militaristic state and join aggressive military blocs will never succeed, because the German people will never agree to do so.
    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is the embodiment of the German people's will to oppose Germany's return to the path of militarism and war, and to strive for peaceful and democratic development. For more than six years, the German Democratic Republic has made tremendous achievements in peaceful construction. It has become a strong bastion of the peace-loving and democratic forces of the German people, and a reliable foundation for establishing a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany. As Khrushchev, a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, said: "The German Democratic Republic is the future. This is not only the future of the German people."
    The German Democratic Republic has held high the banner of peaceful reunification of Germany since its establishment. It believes that the reunification of Germany is first and foremost a matter for the Germans themselves, and has unswervingly worked for this noble cause. Over the years, the government and parliament of the German Democratic Republic have taken dozens of formal actions, urging West Germany and East Germany to come together for consultations to seek Germany's unification. The slogan put forward by the German Democratic Republic government, "Germans sit down at a table," has become the goal of the struggle of the entire German people. However, the West German authorities have stubbornly rejected all constructive proposals from the German Democratic Republic.
    The German Democratic Republic has consistently defended the German people's right to self-determination, and has repeatedly advocated achieving German unification through free all-German elections. The implementation of the Paris Agreements has led West Germany to openly embark on the path of remilitarization and join the Western military bloc, and the situation has undergone serious changes. The German Democratic Republic believes that only by first eliminating the threat to the security of the German people caused by West Germany's remilitarization and participation in the Western military bloc can truly democratic and free elections be held. The German Democratic Republic advocates, in accordance with the Soviet proposal, gradually removing the constraints of West Germany's military treaties by establishing a European collective security system in which both German states participate, in order to create external conditions for unifying Germany into a peaceful and democratic state; at the same time, it suggests establishing all-German institutions to implement cooperation between the two parts of Germany, in order to create internal conditions for reunifying Germany. This is undoubtedly a realistic way to eliminate the division of Germany. It shows that the German Democratic Republic is sincerely and realistically striving to restore the unification of Germany.
    The German Democratic Republic has also put forward a clear program regarding what kind of Germany a unified Germany should be. It advocates that the future Germany should be a peaceful and democratic country without militaristic elements. It should be free from the rule of monopoly capital and Junker landlords. In a unified Germany, in addition to public ownership and various forms of cooperative ownership, there can also be capitalist ownership. In this country, freedom of belief should be guaranteed, and national culture, science, and art can develop freely. Such a Germany should have complete national sovereignty and its own national defense forces. There should be no foreign military bases or foreign troops on its territory, and it should not participate in military alliances. The inviolability of Germany's borders should be guaranteed by a European collective security treaty. Such a blueprint for the future Germany is fully in line with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security. It not only reflects the will of the vast majority of the German people, but also meets the wishes of all peace-loving people.
    However, the United States, Britain, and France, regardless of the will of the German people, insist on imposing their own set of "unified Germany plan" on the German people. According to their plan, it is to incorporate the German Democratic Republic into the Bonn state, in an attempt to establish militaristic rule throughout Germany and make the entire Germany a tool for their preparation for war. Such a "unified" plan means that the democratic achievements that the working people of the German Democratic Republic have obtained through hard work will be wiped out, and it means that more than 60 million German people will once again be driven into the abyss of war. This not only harms the interests of the German Democratic Republic, but also violates the interests of the entire German people, and endangers peace and security in Europe and the world. This method is of course absolutely unworkable. The German Democratic Republic defends the revolutionary achievements of the working people of democratic Germany and the national interests of the German people, and resolutely opposes this evil plot. This position of the German Democratic Republic is supported by all just and peace-loving people.
    Although some Western diplomats still do not recognize that there is a German Democratic Republic, they have no way to change the fact that the German Democratic Republic exists and is increasingly consolidated and developed, and they have no way to prevent more and more countries from developing increasingly close ties with the German Democratic Republic. They also have no way to weaken the increasing attraction of the German Democratic Republic to the broad masses of the people in West Germany, and they have no way to prevent the entire German people from seeing the German Democratic Republic as their hope and reliance for restoring the unification of their motherland.
    Recently, the public in West Germany has been increasingly demanding that the Adenauer government conduct consultations with the government of the German Democratic Republic to seek the restoration of German unification. Many politicians have pointed out that if Germany is to be unified, there is no other way but through consultations between the two parts of Germany, East and West. The increasingly widespread support for this proposition from all walks of life in West Germany is inseparable from the great achievements of the German Democratic Republic and its unremitting efforts to strive for German unification. The government of the German Democratic Republic recently issued a statement on the results of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, reiterating its readiness to work together with the West German government to make the necessary efforts to establish an all-German committee, and calling on all the German people to take the cause of reunifying Germany into their own hands. There is no doubt that the efforts of the German Democratic Republic to strive for the restoration of Germany's unification in accordance with the principles that are in line with European peace and the national interests of Germany will receive increasingly broad sympathy and support from the entire German people and peace-loving people of all countries. The great historical task of establishing a peaceful and democratic unified Germany will eventually be realized.

    德意志民主共和国高举着和平统一的旗帜
    谭文瑞
    不久以前结束的四国外交部长会议，不仅向全世界人民揭露了阻挠和平解决德国问题的根本障碍是什么，而且清楚地显示出重新统一德国的现实道路在那里。现在任何人都可以明白：德国必须恢复统一，而且也一定能够恢复统一，但是德国的统一只能在和平和民主的基础上实现。任何企图使德国现存的两部分机械地合并成为一个军国主义国家并参加侵略性军事集团的打算，是永远也不会成功的，因为德国人民绝不同意这样做。
    德意志民主共和国的成立，就是德国人民反对使德国重新走上军国主义和战争的道路而争取和平和民主的发展的意志的体现。六年多以来，德意志民主共和国在和平建设方面已取得了巨大的成就，它已成为德国人民爱好和平和民主力量的坚强堡垒，成为建立一个统一的、和平和民主的德国的可靠基础。正如苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫所说的：“德意志民主共和国就是未来。这不仅是德国人民的未来。”
    德意志民主共和国自它成立之日起就高举着和平统一德国的旗帜。它认为重新统一德国首先是德国人自己的事情，并坚持不渝地为这个崇高的事业而努力。几年来，德意志民主共和国政府和议会曾经采取了几十次的正式行动，敦促西德同东德双方面在一起进行协商，以谋求德国的统一。德意志民主共和国政府提出的“德国人坐到一张桌子旁来”的口号，已成为全德人民斗争的目标。但是迄今西德当局顽固地拒绝德意志民主共和国一切建设性的建议。
    德意志民主共和国一贯维护德国人民的自决权利，并曾屡次主张通过举行全德自由选举来实现德国统一。巴黎协定的实施使西德公开走上了重新军国主义化的道路，并且参加了西方军事集团，局势就发生了严重的变化。德意志民主共和国认为，现在只有首先消除掉由于西德重新军国主义化和参加了西方军事集团而造成的对德国人民安全的威胁，然后才有可能举行真正民主和自由的选举。德意志民主共和国主张按照苏联的建议，通过建立两个德意志国家都参加的欧洲集体安全体系，逐步解除西德的军事条约的束缚，以为把德国统一为一个和平民主国家创造外部的条件；同时建议通过建立全德机构，实行德国两部分的合作，以为重新统一德国创造内部条件。这无疑是消除德国分裂的现实的途径。它表明德意志民主共和国是真诚和实事求是地为恢复德国的统一而努力。
    关于统一后的德国应该是怎么样的一个德国，德意志民主共和国也提出了鲜明的纲领。它主张：未来的德国应该是一个没有军国主义分子的、和平和民主的国家。它应当摆脱垄断资本和容克地主的统治。在统一的德国里，除人民所有制和各种形式的合作社所有制外，还可以有资本主义所有制。在这个国家里，信仰自由应该受到保障，民族文化和科学艺术可以自由发展。这样的德国应拥有完全的国家主权，有自己的国家的国防军队。它的国土上不应有任何外国军事基地和外国军队，它不参加军事联盟。德国国界的不可侵犯应由欧洲集体安全条约给予保障。这样一个未来的德国的蓝图，是完全符合于德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全利益的，它不仅反映了绝大多数德国人民的意志，而且也合乎一切爱好和平人民的愿望。
    但是，美、英、法三国却不顾德国人民的意志，它们硬要把它们自己决定的一套“统一德国计划”强加在德国人民头上。根据它们的计划，那就是要把德意志民主共和国并入波恩国家，以图在整个德国建立军国主义的统治，使整个德国成为它们准备战争的工具。这样的“统一”计划也就是意味着要使德意志民主共和国劳动人民经过艰苦努力才获得的民主成果化为乌有，意味着把六千多万德国人民再一次驱入战争的深渊。这不仅损害德意志民主共和国的利益，而且违反全体德国人民的利益，危害欧洲和世界的和平和安全。这种办法当然是绝对行不通的。德意志民主共和国维护民主德国劳动人民的革命成果和德国人民的民族利益，坚决反对这个罪恶图谋。德意志民主共和国的这个立场得到所有公正和爱好和平的人士的支持。
    尽管一些西方外交家到现在还不承认有一个德意志民主共和国，但是他们却没有办法改变德意志民主共和国存在并日益巩固发展的事实，没有办法阻止愈来愈多的国家同德意志民主共和国发生日益密切的联系。他们也没有办法削弱德意志民主共和国对西德广大人民的日益增大的吸引力，没有办法阻止全体德国人民把德意志民主共和国看作是他们恢复祖国统一的希望和依靠。
    最近以来，西德公众要求阿登纳政府同德意志民主共和国政府进行协商以谋求恢复德国统一的呼声日益高涨。许多政界人士纷纷指出，要想实现德国的统一，除了通过东西两部分德国之间的协商，别无其他道路。西德各阶层人士愈来愈广泛支持这个主张，这是同德意志民主共和国的巨大成就和它争取德国统一的不懈努力分不开的。德意志民主共和国政府最近就四国外长会议结果发表声明，再一次重申它准备同西德政府共同作出必要的努力来建立全德委员会，并号召全体德国人民把重新统一德国的事业掌握在自己的手里。毫无疑问，德意志民主共和国争取德国在符合于欧洲和平和德国民族利益的原则下恢复统一的努力将得到全德人民和各国爱好和平人民越来越广泛的同情和支持。建立一个和平民主的统一的德国的伟大历史任务终将实现。
