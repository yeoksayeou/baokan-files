    Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, December 13th: The Chinese Science Delegation to Japan arrived in Osaka by car on the morning of December 12th from Kyoto. That afternoon, the head of the delegation, Guo Moruo, and delegation members Feng Naichao and Xiong Fu attended a welcome tea party hosted by the Osaka Joint Association of Mass Organizations.
    Tawata Kiyomi, chairman of the Osaka Branch of the Japan National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, delivered a welcoming speech at the tea party, saying: Today's Japan, with foreign troops stationed here, has become a colony in all aspects, and trade is also subject to foreign control. The Japanese people are pouring all their enthusiasm into the struggle against such imperialist aggression. He pointed out that the restoration of diplomatic relations and the conduct of cultural and economic exchanges between China and Japan will help Japan obtain the foundations for independence and peace.
    Guo Moruo then delivered a speech. He expressed the hope to convey to the Japanese people the Chinese people's willingness to learn from Japanese friends and their desire to normalize relations between China and Japan. Guo Moruo said: The Chinese people believe that the hardworking, brave, and patriotic Japanese people will surely gain freedom, peace, and independence.
    That evening, the entire delegation attended a welcome banquet jointly hosted by the Osaka Prefectural and Osaka Municipal governments. More than 50 people from the Japanese side attended the banquet, including the administrative heads and parliamentary leaders of Osaka Prefecture and Osaka City, as well as presidents and professors from universities in Osaka and the Kansai region.
    The Governor of Osaka Prefecture, Akama Bunzo, said in his welcoming speech that he believed that friendly relations between China and Japan would be restored in the near future.
    Guo Moruo said in his speech that the Chinese people are willing to restore and develop traditional friendship with the Japanese people on a new basis. The early normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan is the wish of the Chinese people. Many well-known cultural figures from Japan also spoke at the banquet, unanimously expressing their hope that China and Japan would restore their traditional friendly relations as soon as possible in order to fully conduct academic and cultural exchanges.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 14th: Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese Science Delegation, and delegation members Jian Bozan and Mao Yisheng, attended a lecture meeting held at Osaka University Medical School on the afternoon of the 12th at the invitation of the university. There were approximately 2,000 students from various universities in Osaka in the audience.
    Mao Yisheng and Jian Bozan delivered speeches on "China's Railway and Highway Construction" and "The Current Situation of Education in China," respectively. Subsequently, Guo Moruo began his speech amidst thunderous applause.
    In his speech, Guo Moruo detailed the status of various construction undertakings being carried out by the Chinese people. He pointed out that China is making every effort to transform itself from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. In order to achieve this goal, the Chinese people sincerely hope for a peaceful international environment. Striving for, safeguarding, and consolidating world peace is China's basic policy. The Chinese people are willing to coexist peacefully with the people of all countries in the world, especially with their close neighbors, the Japanese people.
    He pointed out that some people are not happy about China's industrialization because they hold colonialist aims. They do not recognize us, but the People's Republic of China does not disappear from the earth because some people do not recognize it. They want to economically blockade us, but the result of the blockade and embargo is that many other countries, including Japan, have suffered significant losses. They want to use the threat of war to obstruct our peaceful coexistence with the people of all countries, but history has proven that this will not achieve results favorable to them.
    Guo Moruo said: We, the Chinese people, are willing to loudly appeal to the people of Asian countries: We Asians will never fight Asians, nor will we fight the people of other continents. We are also willing to loudly appeal to the people of other continents: The people of other continents should not fight each other, nor should they fight others. The people of all continents around the world should join hands to strive for peaceful coexistence and oppose war, especially atomic war!
    Guo Moruo said: The Chinese people sincerely hope that the Japanese people can obtain true independence, peace, and freedom, and the Chinese people also sincerely hope to have friendly exchanges and peaceful coexistence with the Japanese people. The Chinese people also sincerely hope that the people of China and Japan will join hands to carry out an unyielding struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world.
    In his speech, Guo Moruo also mentioned the Japanese people's significant contributions in the struggle for national independence and the defense of peace, and he expressed the Chinese people's lofty respect for this.
    Guo Moruo's speech was welcomed by the audience with applause.

    郭沫若等在大阪大学医学院发表演讲
    新华社十三日讯　大阪消息：中国访日科学代表团十二月十二日上午从京都乘汽车到达大阪。当天下午，团长郭沫若和团员冯乃超、熊复出席了大阪各群众团体联合会主办的欢迎茶会。
    日本拥护宪法国民联合会大阪分会会长田万清臣在茶会上致欢迎词说：今天的日本在外国军队驻留下，在一切方面都殖民地化了，贸易也受到外国管制。对于这样帝国主义的侵略，日本人民正在倾注全部的热情进行着斗争。他指出：中日两国间恢复邦交，进行文化和经济的交流，将有助于日本获得独立与和平的基础。
    郭沫若接着致词。他表示希望把中国人民愿意向日本朋友学习的心情和实现中日两国关系正常化的愿望，转达给日本人民。郭沫若说：中国人民认为勤劳勇敢和爱国的日本人民，一定能够获得自由、和平与独立。
    当天晚上，代表团全体人员出席了大阪府和大阪市联合主办的欢迎宴会。日本方面参加宴会的有大阪府、大阪市的行政首长和议会领袖以及大阪和关西地区各大学校长、教授等五十多人。
    大阪府知事赤间文三在致欢迎词的时候表示：相信中日两国间的友好邦交在不久的将来就会恢复。
    郭沫若致词说：中国人民愿意在新的基础上同日本人民恢复和发展传统的友谊。中日两国之间早日实现邦交的正常化，是中国人民的愿望。在宴会上讲话的还有许多日本知名的文化界人士，他们一致表示希望中日两国早日恢复传统的友好关系，以便充分进行学术、文化的交流。
    新华社十四日讯　东京消息：中国科学代表团团长郭沫若、团员翦伯赞和茅以升在十二日下午应邀出席了在大阪大学医学院举行的讲演会。听众有大阪各大学学生共约两千多人。
    茅以升和翦伯赞分别以“中国的铁路和公路建设”和“中国教育界现况”为题发表了讲演。随后，郭沫若在雷动般的掌声中开始演讲。
    郭沫若在演讲中详细地介绍了中国人民正在进行的各项建设事业的状况。他指出，中国正在作一切的努力，要把中国由一个落后的农业国变成一个先进的工业国。为了实现这个目的，中国人民诚恳地希望能够有一个和平的国际环境。争取、维护和巩固世界的和平，这是中国的基本政策。中国人民愿意同世界各国人民和平共处，特别是愿意同自己的近邻日本人民和平共处。
    他指出，有些人不高兴中国的工业化，因为他们抱着殖民主义的目的。他们不承认我们，但是中华人民共和国并不因为某些人的不承认而从地球上消失。他们要从经济上封锁我们，但是封锁禁运的结果，却是使其他许多国家包括日本在内遭到了重大的损失。他们要用战争的威胁来阻挠我们同各国人民和平共处，但是历史已经证明，这也不会获得对他们有利的结果。
    郭沫若说：我们中国人民愿意向亚洲各国人民大声疾呼：我们亚洲人决不打亚洲人，也决不打其它各洲的人民。我们也愿意向其它各洲人民大声疾呼：其它各洲的人也不要自己打自己，也不要打别人。全世界各洲人民都应当携起手来，为实现和平共处，反对战争特别是原子战争而努力！
    郭沫若说：中国人民诚恳地希望日本人民能够获得真正的独立、和平、自由，中国人民也诚恳地希望同日本人民友好往来，和平相处。中国人民还诚恳地希望，中日两国人民共同携起手来，为保卫亚洲和世界的和平而进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    郭沫若在讲话中还提到日本人民在争取民族独立和保卫和平的斗争中的重大贡献，他代表中国人民对此表示崇高的敬意。
    郭沫若的讲话受到听众的鼓掌欢迎。
