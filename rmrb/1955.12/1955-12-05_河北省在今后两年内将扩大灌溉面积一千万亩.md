Hebei Province, in order to ensure increased production of grain and cotton and support national economic construction, convened a provincial agricultural water conservancy conference in October. The conference formulated a plan to fully utilize underground water resources, deciding to dig 300,000 wells (including brick and stone wells, earthenware pipe wells, pump wells, and machine wells), and appropriately carry out work such as opening canals, building small reservoirs, and constructing pumping stations. It requires that the irrigated area be expanded by 4 million mu in 1956. By the end of 1957, after the task of 10 million mu is fully completed, the irrigated area of the province will reach more than 26 million mu, nearly 22 percent of the total cultivated area of the province. Now, the plan is being communicated to various places, the masses are being mobilized vigorously, cadres and technicians are being trained, and tools and materials are being prepared. (Ren Jie)

    河北省在今后两年内将扩大灌溉面积一千万亩
    河北省为了保证粮棉增产，支持国家经济建设，在十月份召开了全省农田水利会议，制定了充分利用地下水源的计划，决定打井（包括砖石井、缸管井、唧筒井、机井等）三十万眼，并且适当进行开渠、修小水库和抽水机站等工作。要求在一九五六年内扩大灌溉面积四百万亩，至一九五七年底，一千万亩任务全部完成后，全省灌溉面积则达二千六百多万亩，将近全省总耕地面积的百分之二十二。现在各地正在传达计划，大力发动群众，训练干部、技工，筹备工具、物料等工作。　（任杰）
