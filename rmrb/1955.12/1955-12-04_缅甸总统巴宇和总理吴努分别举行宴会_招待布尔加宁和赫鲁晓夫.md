Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 2nd (TASS dispatch) - The President of the Union of Burma, Ba U, held a banquet at the Presidential Palace in Rangoon on the evening of December 1st to welcome the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and the member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev.

From the Soviet side, those attending the banquet were Bulganin and Khrushchev's entourage. From the Burmese side, those attending the banquet included: the entire cabinet of the Union of Burma, headed by Prime Minister U Nu, members of the Supreme Court, and representatives of the various states of the Union of Burma.

Guests also included the Soviet Ambassador to Burma, Syzrantsev, and envoys from other countries stationed in Rangoon.

Ba U delivered a speech at the banquet. He first expressed a warm welcome to Bulganin and Khrushchev. He said that your visit proves your goodwill and your friendly attitude towards us. You harbor good intentions towards us because you agree with our policy of active neutrality. The essence of active neutrality is the Five Principles that you, our Prime Minister U Nu, and the Prime Ministers of India and China have unanimously agreed upon. Ba U emphasized that if these principles are observed not only in words but also in deeds, goodwill can be established among the peoples of all countries, and peace can appear in the world.

Ba U said that in order to ensure international peace and security, we should establish mutual understanding; to this end, we should arrange contacts, especially contacts between national leaders. Your current visit to our country is precisely to achieve this.

Bulganin thanked the President for his warm and friendly welcoming remarks. Bulganin said that we are very touched by the warm and cordial reception from the residents of Rangoon. We feel that our visit to you and being able to contact you personally will help to further develop the friendly relations between our two countries. Our relationship is based on the famous Five Principles. Consolidating the friendship between our two countries and developing the cooperation between our two countries is not only beneficial to the people of our two countries, but also beneficial to peace in Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 3rd (TASS dispatch) - The Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Nu, hosted a banquet on December 2nd to entertain Bulganin and Khrushchev.

Also attending the banquet were Bulganin and Khrushchev's entire entourage, ministers from various ministries of the Burmese government, responsible personnel from various departments, and diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Rangoon.

U Nu spoke at the end of the banquet.

U Nu said: After visiting the Soviet Union, I believed that in the Soviet Union, everyone held boundless sympathy and goodwill towards the Burmese people. After personal contact in the Soviet Union, I no longer had any doubt that the Soviet people were willing to develop closer relations between our two countries. When I left your great country, I was filled with gratitude, and I felt that a solid foundation for the friendship between our two countries had certainly been firmly laid.

U Nu then said: After returning home, I often thought of what the Soviet leaders had repeatedly said: Our relationship is between "equal sovereign states that respect each other and care about maintaining peace." I paid particular attention to the fact that the Soviet leaders attached great importance to the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence, and economic cooperation. It is gratifying that the importance of these principles has been increasingly recognized in a considerable area of the world.

U Nu concluded by saying that this visit to Burma by the outstanding leaders of the Soviet Union will further strengthen the existing friendly relations between our two countries.

Bulganin then delivered a reply.

Bulganin said: The Soviet Union and Burma have different social systems and political systems. However, this does not prevent us from living together in friendship and developing peaceful cooperation, because the people of both our countries are eager to maintain and consolidate the peace needed by the people of all countries, so that they can work for the happiness of mankind peacefully and without fear.

Bulganin said that our policy towards other countries is always respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, equality, and mutual benefit in trade and cultural ties. The relationship between the Soviet Union and the Union of Burma is also based on this foundation.

Bulganin said: We have only spent two days here in total, but we have seen and are convinced that the Burmese people are full of sincere desire to strive for peace and peaceful labor. We are pleased that the Burmese people have made some achievements in eliminating the serious consequences of colonial rule, foreign interference, and destructive wars. We sincerely wish you greater achievements in the future to benefit your country and make your country prosperous. Bulganin concluded by saying that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Burma are already a fact. Let us develop and strengthen this relationship between our two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 2nd - Bulganin and Khrushchev visited Prime Minister U Nu on the morning of December 2nd. Those present at the talks from the Soviet side were Gromyko, Kumykin, Rasulov, Rakhimbabayeva, and Soviet Ambassador to Burma Syzrantsev; those present from the Burmese side were Minister of Defense U Ba Swe, Minister of Industry and Mining U Kyaw Nyein, Minister of Trade U Raschid, Minister of Land Nationalization and Local Administrative Democratization Tekin Zin, and Burmese Ambassador to the Soviet Union U Win.

Before visiting Prime Minister U Nu, Bulganin and Khrushchev also laid wreaths on the tombs of Aung San, the leader of the Burmese people's struggle for national independence, and several ministers of his provisional government that morning. They also visited the Shwedagon Pagoda, Rangoon's most famous monument, and the "Peace Pagoda" in the suburbs of Rangoon, built in 1952.

    缅甸总统巴宇和总理吴努分别举行宴会
    招待布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫
    新华社据塔斯社仰光二日讯  缅甸联邦总统巴宇十二月一日晚间在仰光总统府举行宴会，欢迎苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫。
    苏联方面出席宴会的有布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的随行人员。缅甸方面出席宴会的有：以总理吴努为首的缅甸联邦内阁全体阁员、最高法院成员、缅甸联邦各邦的代表。
    来宾当中还有苏联驻缅甸大使希鲍林和其他国家驻仰光的使节。
    巴宇在宴会上致词。他首先对布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫表示热烈的欢迎。他说，你们的访问证明了你们的善意和你们对我们的友好态度。你们对我们怀着好意，是因为你们赞同我们的积极中立的政策。积极中立的实质就是你们同我们的总理吴努以及同印度总理和中国总理一致同意的五项原则。巴宇着重指出，如果这些原则不仅在字面上、而且在事实上得到遵守的话，各国人民之间就能建立善意，世界上就能出现和平。
    巴宇说，为了保障国际和平和安全，我们应当建立互相了解；为此，我们应当安排接触、特别是国家领导人之间的接触。你们现在访问我国，正是为了做到这一点。
    布尔加宁对总统的热情而友好的欢迎词表示感谢。布尔加宁说，仰光居民的热情而亲切的接待使我们非常感动。我们觉得，我们来访问你们，并且能够亲自同你们接触，这件事将有助于我们两国友好关系的进一步发展。我们的关系是建立在著名的五项原则的基础之上的。巩固我们两国之间的友谊和发展我们两国之间的合作，不仅有利于我们两国的人民，并且也有利于亚洲和全世界的和平。
    新华社据塔斯社仰光三日讯  缅甸联邦总理吴努十二月二日设宴招待布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。
    出席宴会的还有，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的全体随行人员，缅甸政府各部部长、各部的负责工作人员以及各国驻仰光的外交使节。
    吴努在宴会结束时讲了话。
    吴努说：我在访问苏联之后相信，在苏联，大家对缅甸人民是怀着无限的同情和善意的。在苏联进行了个人的接触之后，我对苏联人民愿意发展我们两国的更为密切的关系这一点不再有任何怀疑。当我离开你们伟大国家的时候，我满怀着感激的心情，而且我觉得，我们两国友好的坚固基础已经肯定地牢固地奠定了。
    吴努接着说：我回国之后，特别常常想起苏联领导人所一再说过的这样一句话：我们的关系是“互相尊重和关心于维护和平的、平等的主权国家”之间的关系。我特别注意的是，苏联领导人非常重视互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处、经济合作这些原则。令人感到愉快的是，这些原则的重要性已越来越得到全世界相当大地区的承认。
    吴努最后说，苏联杰出的领导人这次访问缅甸，将会更加加强我们两国现有的友好关系。
    布尔加宁接着致答词。
    布尔加宁说：苏缅两国有着不同的社会制度和政治制度。但是，这并不妨碍我们友好相处和发展和平合作，因为我们两国人民热切希望维护和巩固各国人民所需要的和平，以便安心地、没有恐惧地为人类的幸福劳动。
    布尔加宁说，我们对其他国家的政策永远是尊重领土完整和主权、不干涉其他国家的内政、平等以及在贸易和文化联系方面的互利。苏联同缅甸联邦的关系也就是建立在这一基础上的。
    布尔加宁说：我们在你们这里总共才度过两天，但是我们看到了并且深信，缅甸人民充满了争取和平和和平劳动的真诚愿望。我们高兴的是，缅甸人民在消除殖民统治、外国干涉和破坏性战争的严重后果方面取得了一些成就。我们衷心祝你们今后取得更大的成就，以造福你们国家，使你们国家昌盛。布尔加宁最后说，现在苏联和缅甸之间的友好关系已经是事实。让我们发展和加强我们两国的这种关系吧。
