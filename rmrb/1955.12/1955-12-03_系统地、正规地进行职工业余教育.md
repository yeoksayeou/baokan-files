Systematically and Formally Conduct On-the-Job Workers' Education
Jiang Muyue, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

The lack of managerial cadres and scientific and technological personnel is one of the basic difficulties in China's industrial construction. The cultural and technical levels of the broad masses of workers in our country are very low. According to statistics from 1953, in modern factories and mines, the illiteracy rate among workers is generally about 50%. In industries such as coal mining and construction, the illiteracy rate is about 60% to 70% or higher. The average technical skill level of workers is very low, the types of jobs are unbalanced, there are too many low-skilled workers, and there is a lack of senior skilled workers. Frequent accidents in enterprises, low product quality, and high rejection rates are primarily due to the low cultural and technical levels of workers. Obviously, this situation is incompatible with the requirements of the country's socialist industrialization. Only by actively improving the cultural and technical levels of the broad masses of workers and training a large number of personnel for national construction can we meet the needs of the socialist industrial construction cause.

There are two paths to cultivate talent. One is formal school education, and the other is on-the-job education. Through on-the-job education, cadres, technicians, and workers in factories and mines can be absorbed into schools and systematically study from elementary school to university in their spare time, which can effectively improve the cultural and technical levels of workers. Moreover, students participating in on-the-job learning generally have better political quality, higher learning awareness, and certain production and struggle experience, making it easier to combine learning with practice.

In recent years, China's on-the-job cultural and technical education for workers has greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics from the end of 1954, 2.73 million workers across the country participated in on-the-job cultural learning, more than ten times the number of students enrolled at the end of 1949. As of the end of 1954, more than 1.3 million people had escaped illiteracy, 180,000 had graduated from senior elementary school, and 20,000 had graduated from junior high school. More than 953,000 workers have participated in or graduated from on-the-job technical learning. At the same time, secondary and higher correspondence schools and night schools have also been established on a trial basis in recent years. According to statistics from the first half of 1955, there are 30 night schools affiliated with national universities and night universities run by factories and mines, with more than 10,300 students; 2 correspondence departments affiliated with universities, with more than 3,540 students; and 6 industrial technology night schools, with more than 1,250 students. Through various forms of on-the-job cultural and technical learning, the political consciousness and cultural and technical levels of the broad masses of workers have been improved, and a group of management cadres and scientific and technological personnel have been trained for the country.

However, there are still many problems in the current on-the-job cultural and technical education for workers. These are mainly reflected in: on-the-job cultural and technical education for workers is not systematic enough, not formal enough, and the quality is not high. There is no complete teaching system, the school system is not unified or connected, and the curriculum is not comprehensive enough. Workers' on-the-job study time is often not guaranteed. The quality of teachers in on-the-job schools for workers is very low, and there is a lack of teachers for middle schools and universities. There is also a lack of regular and specific leadership for them; the preparation and lecture time for part-time teachers has not been resolved, and the government education departments' leadership over on-the-job education for workers is generally still quite weak; many industrial enterprise departments and enterprise administrations have not yet regarded organizing on-the-job education for workers as their own task; some trade union organizations also do not pay enough attention to this work. Due to the lack of long-term plans and overall arrangements, on-the-job cultural and technical education for workers has fallen into a state of laissez-faire in many enterprises.

In order to overcome these shortcomings and develop on-the-job education systematically and formally, it is necessary to first establish a formal on-the-job education system in the future. In addition to adopting various learning organization forms such as learning groups, pithead groups, and contracted teaching, according to specific conditions, adapting to the time, the people, and the location, it is also necessary to establish regular on-the-job elementary schools, middle schools, primary technical schools, secondary specialized schools, night school departments of universities, correspondence departments, and night universities in a planned manner. The school system and curriculum of these schools should generally be basically the same as regular schools, except for study time and length of schooling. A formal teaching system should be established in the school, such as roll call, attendance, leave application, transfer, examination, promotion, retention, and graduation. Enterprises should organize workers to participate in and persist in this formal learning in a planned manner, so as to continuously train batches of middle and higher-level management personnel and technical personnel.

Teachers are an important force in conducting on-the-job cultural and technical education for workers. Continuously improving teachers' political, cultural, and professional levels and fully发挥发挥 teachers' work enthusiasm and creativity are the key to improving teaching quality and doing a good job in on-the-job education for workers.

The full-time teachers of on-the-job schools should be resolved by the Ministry of Education in a unified manner, in addition to some assistance from enterprise administrations and trade unions. The existing full-time teachers must be vigorously trained and improved. Their political and ideological leadership must be strengthened, their political theory and current affairs and policy learning must be grasped, their progress must be cared for, their political awareness must be continuously improved, and their ideas of serving the cause of on-the-job education for workers must be consolidated. They should be systematically organized to carry out cultural learning and teaching business research activities through teachers' on-the-job further education schools, further education classes, vacation intensive training, and on-the-job business learning, in order to rapidly improve their cultural and professional levels. It should be clear that the task of full-time teachers is to engage in teaching work and to provide guidance to part-time teachers, and to overcome the phenomenon of using full-time teachers for other work and not being able to guarantee teaching work. In addition, the material life of teachers should also be cared for so that they can engage in teaching work with peace of mind.

In addition to equipping a certain number of full-time teachers, employees of enterprises, engineering and technical personnel, workers with higher cultural and technical levels, family members of employees, and teachers of regular schools should also be selected and hired as part-time teachers. Part-time teachers should be given appropriate remuneration according to the complexity of the courses they teach. Localities should, according to the circumstances, give part-time teachers time and convenience to engage in teaching, and should always pay attention to helping them delve into their business, improve teaching methods, and improve teaching quality; strengthen their ideological leadership, so that they recognize that it is an unshirkable and glorious task to shoulder the responsibility of cultivating personnel for national construction and improving the cultural and technical level of workers; promptly resolve some of their ideological problems and specific difficulties, and give them regular commendation and rewards to consolidate and encourage their work enthusiasm.

Guaranteeing workers' on-the-job study time is an indispensable and important condition for carrying out on-the-job cultural and technical education for workers systematically and formally. In factories and mines, the spare time of workers who are willing to study seriously should mainly be used for learning. No one may arbitrarily occupy workers' spare time. If special circumstances require occupying study time, make-up classes should be arranged in other spare time afterwards. In order to achieve this, factories and mines should, under the leadership of the Party committee, arrange the time for various spare-time activities in a unified and reasonable manner, and streamline meeting activities.

Cadres, model workers, activists, and technical workers in factories and mines are the backbone force in production. Rapidly improving their cultural and technical level is of paramount importance for promoting socialist industrial construction. The leadership of factories and mines must organize them to enroll first, strengthen the specific leadership and management of their study, properly arrange their production, work, and spare-time study time, overcome the difficulties that they have no time to study due to busy work and many meetings, and enable them to concentrate on cultural or technical learning. In terms of learning organization forms, in addition to organizing them to participate in the cultural and technical learning of ordinary workers and strengthening their tutoring, they can also adopt the form of centralized organization and separate classes to conduct learning in concentrated spare time. This type of class facilitates specific control and leadership by the leadership, can promptly conduct supervision and inspection work, and is easy to achieve significant results. In areas where conditions permit, they should be organized to leave production to study, and in the case of concentrated time and energy, they can effectively improve their cultural and technical level in a relatively short period of time.

In order to do a good job in on-the-job cultural and technical education for workers, it is also necessary to further strengthen the organization and leadership of this work.

On-the-job cultural and technical education for workers should be led by government education departments and industrial enterprise departments. Government education departments and industrial enterprise departments should be responsible for formulating the guidelines and policies of on-the-job cultural and technical education for workers, formulating development plans for the cause; formulating teaching plans and teaching outlines; compiling textbooks; inspecting and guiding teaching work; equipping full-time teachers and training work; and should establish and improve the institutions that manage this work. The administration of factories and mines should give specific and practical organizational leadership to on-the-job cultural and technical education for workers, and should be responsible for formulating on-the-job cultural and technical education plans; determining teaching progress; guaranteeing learning time; and actively solving problems such as teachers, teaching equipment, teaching venues, and funding.

Trade union organizations have a major responsibility for on-the-job cultural and technical education for workers. Trade union organizations at all levels should include this work in the trade union work plan and discuss and study it regularly; they should assist government education departments and enterprise administrations in formulating development plans for the cause; supervise the implementation of guidelines and policies; be responsible for organizing and mobilizing workers to enroll; check and understand the students' learning situation and ideological situation; organize students to exchange learning experiences; educate students to abide by learning discipline and ensure that students regularly persist in learning; supervise the guarantee of workers' on-the-job study time; assist in hiring part-time teachers and improving teacher work; and help teachers and students solve some specific difficulties. Trade union organizations should also, in conjunction with the development of labor competitions and in accordance with the current production needs, be responsible for carrying out various mass technical education activities, such as technical lectures, technical performances, technical seminars, technical exhibitions, mutual teaching and mutual learning, and apprenticeships with masters, and should use clubs and various propaganda tools to do a good job in technical publicity.

Systematically and formally conducting on-the-job cultural and technical education, improving the cultural level and technical level of the broad masses of workers, and cultivating a large number of personnel for national construction is a long-term and arduous task. However, as long as we carry it out firmly and practically, after a considerable period of time, we will definitely achieve great results.

    系统地、正规地进行职工业余教育
    中华全国总工会宣传部副部长  江牧岳
    缺乏管理干部和科学技术人材，是我国工业建设的基本困难之一。我国广大职工群众的文化水平和技术水平很低。据一九五三年的统计，在现代化的厂矿企业中，职工中的文盲一般约占百分之五十左右，在煤矿、建筑等产业中，文盲约占百分之六、七十以上。工人的平均技术等级很低，工种不平衡，低级工人过多，而高级熟练工人却缺少。企业中事故多、产品质量低、报废率高，职工的文化、技术水平低是主要原因之一。很明显，这种情况是同国家社会主义工业化的要求不相适应的。只有积极提高广大职工群众的文化、技术水平，大量培养国家建设人材，才能适应社会主义工业建设事业的需要。
    培养人材有两条道路。一条是正规的学校教育，一条就是业余教育。通过业余教育的形式，吸收厂矿企业中的干部、技术人员和工人入学，系统地进行从小学到大学的业余学习，能够有效地提高职工的文化、技术水平。而且参加业余学习的学生，
  一般政治质量较好，学习自觉性较高，具有一定的生产经验和斗争经验，学习易于结合实际。
    几年来，我国的职工业余文化、技术教育有了很大发展。据一九五四年底不完全的统计，全国参加业余文化学习的职工有二百七十三万人，相当于一九四九年底入学人数的十倍以上，截至一九五四年年底，已有一百三十多万人脱离了文盲状态，十八万人从高小毕业，二万人从初中毕业。参加业余技术学习和已经毕业的职工共有九十五万三千多人。同时，几年来也试办了中等、高等函授学校和夜校。据一九五五年上半年统计，全国高等学校附设的夜校和厂矿举办的夜大学共有三十所，学员一万零三百多人；高等学校附设函授部二所，学员三千五百四十多人，工业技术夜校六所，学员一千二百五十多人。通过各种形式的业余文化、技术学习，提高了广大职工的政治觉悟和文化、技术水平，为国家培养了一批管理干部和科学技术人材。
    但是，目前在职工业余文化、技术教育中还有不少问题。这主要表现在：职工业余文化、技术教育还不够系统，不够正规，质量不高，没有一套完整的教学制度，学制不统一不衔接，课程也不全面。职工的业余学习时间常常得不到保证。职工业余学校的教师质量很低，而且缺乏中学和大学的师资，对他们也缺乏经常的具体的领导；兼职教师的备课、讲课时间，也没有得到解决，政府教育部门对职工业余教育的领导，一般还相当薄弱；不少工业企业部门和企业行政还没有把组织职工业余教育作为自己的任务；有些工会组织对于这一工作也不够重视。由于缺乏长期打算和通盘安排，职工业余文化、技术教育在很多企业中陷于自流状态。
    为了克服上述这些缺点，使职工业余教育系统地、正规地开展起来，今后必须首先建立起正规的业余教育的体系。各地除了根据具体条件，因时、因人、因地制宜，采用学习小组、坑口小组、包教包学等多种多样的学习组织形式外，还必须有计划地建立正规的职工业余小学、中学，业余初等技术学校，业余中等专业学校，高等学校夜校部、函授部和夜大学。这些学校的学制课程，除学习时间和修业年限以外，一般应该同正规的学校基本上相同。学校里要建立一套正规的教学制度，如点名、考勤、请假、转学、考试考查、升级、留级、毕业等。企业有计划地组织职工参加和坚持这种正规学习，就可以不断地培养出一批批中等的和高等的管理人员和技术人材。
    教师是进行职工业余文化、技术教育的重要力量。不断提高教师的政治、文化、业务水平，充分发挥教师的工作积极性和创造性，是提高教学质量和搞好职工业余教育的关键问题。
    业余学校的专职教师，除由企业行政和工会协助解决一部分外，应该由教育部统一负责解决。对现有的专职教师，必须大力进行培养提高工作。要加强对他们的政治思想领导，抓紧他们的政治理论学习和时事政策学习，关心他们的进步，不断提高他们的政治觉悟，巩固他们为职工业余教育事业服务的思想。要有计划地通过教师业余进修学校、进修班，利用假期集训和在职业务学习等方式，组织他们系统地进行文化学习和教学业务研究活动，迅速提高他们的文化、业务水平。要明确专职教师的任务是从事教学工作并且对兼职教师进行辅导，克服使用专职教师作其他工作不能保证教学工作的现象。此外，还应该关心教师的物质生活，使他们能够安心地从事教学工作。
    除配备一定数量的专职教师以外，还应该选聘企业的职员，工程技术人员，文化、技术水平较高的工人，职工家属和正规学校的教师担任兼职教师。对于兼职教师，应根据担任课程的繁简给予适当报酬。各地应根据情况，给兼职教师以从事教学的时间和方便，并且经常注意帮助他们钻研业务，改进教学方法，提高教学质量；加强对他们的思想领导，使他们认识到担负起培养国家建设人材，提高职工文化、技术水平，是一项义不容辞的光荣任务；及时解决他们当中的一些思想问题和具体困难，定期给以表扬和奖励，巩固和鼓舞他们的工作热情。
    保证职工的业余学习时间，是系统地、正规地进行职工业余文化、技术教育的一个必不可少的重要条件。在厂矿企业中，凡是愿意认真学习的职工，他们的业余时间主要应当用在学习方面。任何人不得随意侵占职工的业余时间。如遇到特殊事情需要占用学习时间时，亦应在事后找其它业余时间补课。为了做到这一点，厂矿企业应该在党委的领导下，统一地、合理地安排各项业余活动时间，精简会议活动。
    厂矿企业中的干部、劳动模范、积极分子和技术工人，是生产中的骨干力量。迅速提高他们的文化、技术水平，对于推进社会主义工业建设有着头等重要的意义。厂矿企业领导上必须组织他们首先入学，加强对于他们学习的具体领导和管理，妥善安排他们的生产、工作和业余学习时间，克服他们因工作忙、会议多而没有时间学习的困难，使他们专心致力于文化或技术学习。在学习组织形式上，除组织他们参加一般工人的文化、技术学习，加强对他们的辅导工作外，还可以采取集中组织、单独开班的形式，集中业余时间进行学习。这种班次便于领导上具体掌握和领导，能够及时进行督促检查工作，容易收到显著效果。在有条件的地区，应组织他们脱离生产学习，在时间集中、精力集中的情况下，能够在较短的时间内，有效地提高他们的文化、技术水平。
    为了做好职工业余文化、技术教育工作，还必须进一步加强对这项工作的组织领导。
    职工业余文化、技术教育应由政府教育部门和工业企业部门负责领导。政府教育部门和工业企业部门应该负责拟订职工业余文化、技术教育的方针、政策、制定事业发展计划；制定教学计划和教学大纲；编写教材；检查指导教学工作；配备专职教师和培养训练工作；并应建立和健全管理这一工作的机构。厂矿企业行政应对职工业余文化、技术教育给予具体的切实的组织领导，应负责制定职工业余文化、技术教育计划；确定教学进度；保证学习时间；积极解决师资、教学设备、教学场所和经费等问题。
    工会组织对职工业余文化、技术教育工作负有重大责任。工会各级组织应将这一工作列入工会工作计划，定期讨论研究；应协助政府教育部门和企业行政制定事业发展计划；监督方针、政策的实施、负责组织动员职工入学；检查了解学员的学习情况和思想情况；组织学员交流学习经验；教育学员遵守学习纪律，保证学员经常坚持学习；监督职工业余学习时间的保证；协助聘请兼职教师和提高师资工作；帮助教师和学员解决一些具体困难问题。工会组织还应结合劳动竞赛的开展，适应当前生产的需要，负责进行各种群众性的技术教育，如技术讲座、技术表演、技术座谈会、技术展览、互教互学、师傅带徒弟等，并且利用俱乐部和各种宣传工具做好技术宣传工作。
    系统地正规地进行职工业余文化、技术教育，提高广大职工的文化水平和技术水平，大量培养国家建设人材，这是一个长期的艰巨的工作。但是，只要我们坚定不移地、脚踏实地地进行，经过一段相当长的时间，我们一定会获得很大的成绩。
