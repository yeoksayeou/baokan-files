The large-scale increase in hog production is an important task in agricultural production. It plays a significant role in promoting agricultural production, increasing farmers' income, supplying meat to urban and rural areas, developing export trade, and supporting national industrialization. However, the hog production increase target for 1955 was not achieved, especially in the first half of the year when the number of hogs was significantly lower than in the same period of 1954. This situation is clearly inconsistent with the growing needs of the country and the people and is detrimental to the development of the entire national economy. The reasons for the decline in hog production in 1955 are: some areas suffered from floods in 1954, resulting in poor harvests; some areas did not pay enough attention to pig feed during the unified purchase of grain, resulting in insufficient reserves; many things that can be used to feed pigs have not been widely utilized; and some economic and technical work closely related to the development of hog production has also been done poorly, and so on. Although some of these are objective factors, insufficient subjective effort and shortcomings in the unified purchase and sale of grain are important reasons after all.

At present, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for taking the socialist road is unprecedentedly high, and the agricultural cooperation movement is entering a vigorous upsurge throughout the country, and a high tide of agricultural production development will follow. This is a favorable condition for the development of hog production. In 1955, most areas had bumper harvests, and the total grain output of the country increased by 24.8 billion jin compared with 1954; and the policy of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain was implemented, appropriately reducing the grain unified purchase target, reducing the purchase of 6.4 billion jin of commercial grain (equivalent to about 7.5 billion jin of raw grain) compared with 1954. With such an increase and a decrease, farmers have more than 30 billion jin of grain in their hands than last year, which is also an extremely favorable condition for the development of hog production. Since the autumn harvest, the fact that the number of hogs has been increasing continuously and the price of piglets has been rising in many places fully proves this point. As long as we actively work hard and are good at using these favorable conditions, the arduous task of increasing hog production in the last two years of the first five-year plan can be completed, must be strived to be completed, and should be strived to exceed. For this purpose, the following instructions are hereby given:

(1) People's Committees at all levels in provinces (municipalities) and counties and townships must formulate specific plans for increasing hog production and earnestly implement them. Areas with relatively serious declines in hog production must strive to restore and exceed the pre-reduction level in the spring of 1956. The basic method of increasing hog production is to universally mobilize farmers to raise pigs, call on members of agricultural production cooperatives to take the lead in raising pigs, and advocate that agricultural production cooperatives with conditions raise pigs collectively; all state-owned farms and ranches must formulate specific pig raising plans to ensure their realization. In the past, the shortcomings of not including pig raising in the agricultural production plan, or only stipulating a general production increase target without correspondingly stipulating a series of specific production increase measures, must be corrected.

(2) Vigorously open up feed sources. The agricultural departments of provinces, municipalities, and counties should summarize and promote the experience of farmers in using various feeds to mix and feed pigs and using more coarse feed to feed pigs, promote advanced feeding methods, and strive to save grain and feed pigs well. Mobilize the masses to collect a large amount of wild feed and by-products of crops to raise pigs, and according to local conditions, make use of vacant land, idle land, and abandoned land with poor soil to plant feed crops as much as possible. In the south, green manure crops should be planted in winter fallow fields, and a part should be cut to feed pigs.

(3) Strengthen the supply and regulation of feed. In the unified purchase of grain, the People's Committees of each province should formulate appropriate grain retention standards for pig feed according to the different conditions in various regions of the province. Key pig-producing provinces should allocate a portion of grain within the province's grain supply target to supply areas with concentrated pig production, large export tasks, and relatively scarce feed. All kinds of oil cakes should be used as feed as much as possible, and fertilizer should be accumulated through pig raising to minimize the direct use of oil cakes for fertilizing fields. However, oil cake feeding pigs to accumulate fertilizer requires a certain turnaround time, and supply and marketing cooperatives must supply oil cakes to farmers as early as possible to avoid delaying the fertilizer application season. The grain and commerce departments of the People's Committees at all levels must check the production, sales, surplus, and shortage of feed, and according to the local feed circulation law, release the stored feed for sale in a timely manner to prevent backlog and spoilage.

Supply and marketing cooperatives should closely contact grain and oil processing factories and workshops, and earnestly improve the transfer and supply of by-products obtained from grain and oil processing; for by-products that can be used as feed, both parties should sign contracts and organize supply in a planned manner. The prices of bran and bean cake must be lower than the local price of raw grain, and a reasonable difference must be maintained. In places where the prices of bran and bean cake are equal to or nearly equal to the price of raw grain, the prices of bran and bean cake must be lowered.

Without hindering the grain supply in cities and industrial and mining areas, a part of the raw grain should be left in rural areas and market towns for local processing. Raw grain can also be supplied to grain-deficient farmers so that farmers can use the by-products obtained from processing these raw grains to raise pigs.

(4) The agricultural departments of large and medium-sized cities should earnestly organize suburban farmers, agricultural production cooperatives, and state-owned farms near grain processing factories to purchase semi-finished pigs and use the by-products of the factories to fatten them locally; organize suburban pig farmers, agricultural production cooperatives, farms, and ranches to collect swill in the city to raise pigs. Organs and schools located in the suburbs can also raise pigs to supply themselves with some meat food. Every city should actively organize and develop suburban hog production to supply part or most of the meat food needed by the city, and this should be made the task of the city's agricultural and commercial departments.

(5) Cultivate pig sources in a planned manner. Reward the feeding of excellent breeding boars and sows and increase the number of excellent piglets. For areas lacking piglets, supply and marketing cooperatives should transport and regulate them themselves or organize small merchants to transport and regulate them. Farmers with difficulties in raising pigs should be given loan assistance.

(6) Strengthen the prevention and control of swine fever. Agricultural production cooperatives, state-owned farms, ranches, and state-owned enterprises engaged in hog breeding must earnestly improve feeding management and combine drug prevention to prevent and control swine fever. The phenomenon of large-scale deaths of pigs during concentrated feeding, batch purchases, and long-distance transportation must be resolutely prevented. In places where pig raising is concentrated, live pig distribution markets, and traffic lines with frequent pig transportation, agricultural departments should cooperate with health departments to train existing folk veterinarians in a planned manner, train commercial and cooperative department personnel for preventing and controlling swine fever, and carry out preventive injections; and appropriate injection fees can be charged, which shall be controlled by the local government to strengthen regular pig disease prevention and control work.

(7) Develop the collective pig raising of agricultural production cooperatives in a planned manner, and vigorously advocate that members' families raise pigs to accumulate fertilizer. Newly established agricultural production cooperatives and those lacking experience in collective pig raising can also distribute the cooperative's pigs to members for decentralized feeding. Cooperatives should produce feed in a planned manner and rationally distribute feed according to the needs of members and pig raising within the cooperative. Cooperatives should purchase members' pig manure, taking into account both public and private interests, and pricing according to quality, to encourage members' enthusiasm for raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer.

(8) Do a good job in the assigned pig raising and purchase work. When distributing assigned pig raising and purchase tasks level by level, purchasing departments should not add to the assignments at each level, and should publicize the state's policy of assigned pig raising and purchase to farmers, explaining that farmers can dispose of the surplus pigs themselves after completing the assigned purchase tasks, and increase breeding without increasing purchases. Purchasing departments should sign assigned pig raising and purchase contracts with pig farmers and act in accordance with the contracts. The assigned pig raising and purchase figures should be appropriately determined, not only to complete the state's assigned pig raising and purchase tasks, but also to take care of farmers' own meat food needs, and not to oppose these two things. The purchase standards should be determined according to local pig breeds, feed, and other conditions, and should not blindly raise requirements or deviate from reality. The purchase procedures and the work style of the purchase personnel should be continuously improved. In places where the purchase price of live pigs is too low and the difference between the price of live pigs and the price of pork is too large, appropriate adjustments should be made, and the policy of paying higher prices for better quality should be earnestly implemented to encourage farmers to sell fat pigs to the state.

Finally, the agricultural, commercial, and grain departments and supply and marketing departments of the People's Committees at all levels should unify their steps, cooperate closely, and earnestly study and solve specific issues related to pig production, purchase, and feed supply. The People's Committees of provinces and counties in key pig-producing areas should also designate special personnel among the responsible cadres of financial and economic work to be responsible for leading pig production and ensure the completion of the task of increasing pig production.

    国务院关于增产生猪的指示
    大量增产生猪，是农业生产中的一项重要任务。它对于促进农业增产，增加农民收入，供应城乡肉食，发展出口贸易，支援国家工业化，都有重大的作用。然而，一九五五年的生猪增产任务没有完成，特别是上半年的生猪头数比一九五四年同期减少很多。这种情况，同国家和人民日益增长的需要显然是不相适应的，对整个国民经济的发展是不利的。一九五五年生猪减产的原因是：有些地区在
  一九五四年遭受水灾，收成不好；有些地区在统购粮食中对猪的饲料注意不够，留量过小；各地有许多可以喂猪的东西，还没有广泛地加以利用；同发展生猪密切相关的一些经济工作和技术工作，也做得较差，等等。其中虽然有的是客观的因素，但是主观努力不够和粮食统购统销工作中的缺点毕竟是重要的原因。
    目前，广大农民走社会主义道路的积极性空前高涨，全国各地的农业合作化运动正在进入蓬勃发展的高潮，农业生产大发展的高潮也将跟着出现，这是发展生猪的有利条件。一九五五年绝大部分地区农产丰收，全国粮食总产量比一九五四年增加了二百四十八亿斤；又执行了粮食定产、定购、定销的政策，适当降低了粮食统购指标，比一九五四年少购六十四亿斤商品粮（合原粮约七十五亿斤）。这样一增一减，农民手中就比去年多了三百亿斤以上的粮食，这也是发展生猪的极为有利的条件。秋收以来，许多地方，生猪头数不断增加和仔猪价格上涨的事实，完全证明了这一点。只要我们积极努力，善于运用这些有利条件，第一个五年计划后两年的增产生猪的艰巨任务，是一定可以完成的，也必须争取完成，并且要力求超过。为此，特作如下的指示：
      （一）各省（市）、县、乡人民委员会必须定出增产生猪的具体计划，切实执行。生猪减产比较严重的地区，必须争取在一九五六年春季恢复并且超过减产前的水平。增产生猪的基本办法是普遍发动农民养猪，号召农业生产合作社社员带头养猪，提倡有条件的农业生产合作社集体养猪；所有的国营农场和牧场都要定出具体的养猪计划，保证实现。过去没有把养猪列入农业生产计划，或者只规定一个总的增产指标，而没有相应地规定一系列的具体的增产措施，这个缺点必须改正。
    （二）大力开辟饲料来源。各省、市、县的农业部门应该总结和推广农民群众中利用多种饲料搀搭喂猪和多用粗料喂猪的经验，推广先进的饲养方法，努力作到既能节约粮食，又能把猪喂好。发动群众大量收集野生饲料和农作物的副产品养猪，并且根据各地的条件，尽可能地利用隙地、休闲地和土质不好的废弃土地种植饲料作物。在南方，应该利用冬闲田多种绿肥作物，割取一部分喂猪。
    （三）加强饲料的供应调剂工作，在粮食统购中，各省人民委员会对于猪的饲料应该根据本省内各个地区不同的情况，分别规定适当的留粮标准。重点产猪省，应该在省的粮食供应指标内，下拨一部分粮食，供应猪只集中、出口任务大而饲料比较缺乏的地区。各种油饼，应该尽量作为饲料，通过养猪积肥，尽量少用油饼直接肥田。但是，油饼喂猪积肥需要一定的周转时间，供销合作部门必须提早将油饼供应到农民手中，以免耽误施肥季节。各地人民委员会粮食、商业主管部门，必须检查饲料产、销、余、缺的情况，根据当地饲料流转的规律，把存储待售的饲料及时下放，以防止积压和霉坏变质。
    供销合作社应该同粮食、油料加工厂坊密切联系，认真改善粮食、油料加工所得的副产品的调运供应工作；对于可以用作饲料的副产品，应该由双方签定合同，有计划地组织供应。糠麸和豆饼等的价格，必须低于当地的原粮价格，并且必须保持适当的差额。糠麸豆饼的价格同原粮价格相平或相差无几的地方，必须降低糠麸豆饼的价格。
    在不妨碍城市和工矿区的粮食供应的条件下，应该把一部分原粮留在农村和集镇上就地加工。对于缺粮的农民，也可以供应原粮，使农民能够利用加工这些原粮所得的副产品来养猪。
      （四）大、中城市的农业部门，应该切实组织粮食加工厂附近的郊区农民、农业生产合作社、国营农场收买架子猪，利用加工厂的副产品就地肥育；组织郊区的养猪户、农业生产合作社、农场、牧场，收集市内泔水养猪。住在郊区的机关、学校，也可以养猪，自给一部分肉食品。每个城市都应该积极组织和发展郊区的生猪生产，自给本市所需要的肉食的一部或大部，并且应该把这件事做为市的农业部门和商业部门的任务。
      （五）有计划地培养猪源。奖励喂养优良种公、母猪，增殖优良仔猪。对于缺乏仔猪的地区，应该由供销合作社自己或组织小商人贩运调剂。对养猪有困难的农民，应该给以贷款扶助。
    （六）加强猪疫的防治工作。农业生产合作社、国营农场、牧场和经营生猪的国营企业，必须认真改进饲养管理，结合药物预防，来防治猪疫。对于集中喂养、成批收购和长途运输的过程中，生猪大量病死的现象，必须坚决防止。在养猪集中的地方、生猪集散市场和猪运频繁的交通沿线，农业部门应该协同卫生部门，有计划地训练民间原有的兽医，训练商业和合作部门的防治猪疫的人员，进行预防注射；并且可以收取适当的注射费，由地方政府掌握，以加强经常性的猪病防治工作。
    （七）有计划地发展农业生产合作社的集体养猪，大力提倡社员家庭养猪积肥。新建的和缺乏集体养猪经验的农业生产合作社，也可以把合作社的猪交由社员分散饲养。合作社应该有计划地生产饲料，并且根据社员和社内养猪的需要，合理分配饲料。合作社收购社员猪粪，必须公私两利，按质论价，以鼓励社员养猪积肥的积极性。
    （八）做好生猪派养派购工作。收购部门在逐级下达派养派购任务的时候，不要层层加派，应该向农民宣传国家派养派购生猪的政策，说明农民在完成派购任务以后多余的生猪可以自行处理，增养不增购。应该由收购部门同养猪户订立派养派购合同，按合同办事。派养派购的数字要定得适当，既要完成国家派养派购的任务，又要照顾农民自己的肉食需要，不要把这两件事对立起来。收购标准，要根据各地猪种、饲料等条件来决定，不要盲目提高要求，脱离实际。收购手续和收购人员的作风，都要不断地改进。在生猪的收购价格偏低，生猪价格同猪肉价格相差过大的地方，应该适当调整，并且应该切实执行优质优价的政策，鼓励农民把肥猪卖给国家。
    最后，各级人民委员会的农业、商业、粮食部门和供销合作部门应该统一步调，密切配合，认真地研究和解决有关生猪的生产、收购、饲料供应等具体问题。养猪重点地区的省、县人民委员会还应该在财经工作的负责干部中指定专人负责领导生猪生产，保证增产生猪任务的完成。
