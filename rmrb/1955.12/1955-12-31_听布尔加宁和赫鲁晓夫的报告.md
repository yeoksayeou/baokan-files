    Listening to the Reports of Bulganin and Khrushchev
    By our Moscow correspondent Li He
    The Soviet Supreme Soviet's Council of the Union and Council of Nationalities held their second joint session at 10:00 a.m. on December 29. Long before the meeting began, the representatives' seats in the hall, the audience seats in the gallery, the press seats, and the diplomatic corps seats were already filled.
    Soviet Premier Bulganin and Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium member Khrushchev delivered reports on their visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan. People listened attentively to these important reports, not only about the visits but also about current international issues. The significant and far-reaching role of these friendly visits in promoting friendship between peoples and world peace, and the love and respect for the Soviet Union expressed by millions of people in India, Burma, and Afghanistan in welcoming the visitors—the reporters' descriptions and evaluations of these aspects were met with frequent applause from the representatives. The representatives also responded with thunderous applause and laughter when the reporters sharply exposed and criticized the stain on humanity—the colonial system.
    When Khrushchev pointed out in his report that the coexistence of different systems does not mean abandoning one's own ideals, and that the socialist system is infinitely superior to the capitalist system, his words received warm approval.
    The Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting reflected the thoughts and sentiments of the Soviet people today, who heartily congratulated Bulganin and Khrushchev on the contribution of this historic visit to the cause of world peace and friendly cooperation among peoples.
    While Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev were in India, Burma, and Afghanistan, people all over the Soviet Union waited for newspapers and radio broadcasts every day. The scenes of Soviet leaders meeting with the vast peoples of the three Asian countries, and Comrade Khrushchev's wonderful speeches, particularly attracted people. Kuzmin, a lathe operator at the "Red Proletarian" factory in Moscow, testified: During these days, in his factory as throughout the country, no one failed to read the newspapers with particular keen interest, and people talked a lot about the results of the visit at work and at home.
    In recent days, seminars and reports on this historic visit have been held in many factories and enterprises in Moscow. Tens of thousands of people watch the color documentary about the visits of Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev to India, Burma, and Afghanistan in cinemas and clubs in Moscow every day.
    "Pravda," "Izvestia," and other Soviet newspapers receive many letters from readers every day. The "Pravda" editorial department said: "Readers have reflected the feelings of the entire Soviet people, warmly praising the results of the Soviet leaders' visit, and warmly writing about the friendship of the peoples of the Soviet Union, China, India, Burma, Afghanistan, and other peace-loving countries. The Soviet people sincerely wish the friendly Asian people success in peaceful construction."
    Donbass miner V. Frukalo wrote in "Pravda":
  "The visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to Asian countries has greatly strengthened the peace front. The great Chinese people and the great Indian people are fighting for peace together with the Soviet people. The friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and India is a tremendous force." Bektembayev, a worker at the Aramydin State Farm in the Kyrgyz Republic, wrote: "Along with us, India, Burma, Afghanistan, and many other countries firmly demand that the People's Republic of China be granted its legitimate seat in the United Nations. All the Soviet people warmly approve of this and congratulate Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev on the results of their visit to Asian countries. This visit has brought peace-loving people closer together." Latvian poet Jan Sudrabkalns wrote: "The joy of millions of people around the world brought about by the fruitful results of the Soviet leaders—friendly envoys—has aroused the annoyance of certain Western socio-political activists and reactionary newspapers. But their malice is only new evidence that neither cunningly crafted conspiracies, nor clumsy threats of force, nor distortions of the truth, nor vile slanders against the advocates of friendly cooperation among free peoples, can help the colonialists. The colonial system is collapsing. Hundreds of millions of people in Asian countries have broken the shackles of the colonialists and embarked on the road of building a new and free life."

    听布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的报告
    本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    苏联最高苏维埃的联盟院和民族院十二月二十九日上午十时举行第二次联席会议。会议开始前许久，大厅的代表席、楼上的旁听席、记者席和外交使团席上已经坐着很多人。
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫先后作了关于访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的报告。人们聚精会神地听取了这两个不单关于访问而且关于目前国际问题的重要报告。这次友好访问对于人民的友谊和世界和平的重大和深远的作用，印度、缅甸和阿富汗千百万人民通过迎接访问者所表现的对苏联的敬爱，——报告人关于这些方面的描述和估价，博得了代表们表示赞许的频频掌声。在报告人尖锐地揭发和抨击人类的污点——殖民体系的时候，代表们也报以雷动的掌声和共鸣的笑声。
    当赫鲁晓夫在报告中指出不同制度的并存不是说要放弃自己的理想，社会主义制度较资本主义制度无比优越的时候，他的话得到了热烈的赞同。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议反映了苏联全国人民今天的思想和情绪，他们衷心祝贺布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫这次有历史意义的访问对于世界和平事业和人民友好合作的贡献。
    当布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同志在印度、缅甸和阿富汗的时候，苏联各地人们每天等着报纸和广播。苏联领袖和亚洲三国广大人民会见的场面，赫鲁晓夫同志的精彩演说，特别吸引人们。莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂镟工库兹明证明：在这些日子里，在他的工厂中正如在全国一样，没有人不以特别热烈的兴趣读报，人们在工作中在家里关于这次访问的结果谈得很多。
    最近几天，在莫斯科的许多工厂和企业中举行了关于这次有历史意义的访问的座谈和报告。在莫斯科的电影院和俱乐部每天有许多万人看了布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同志访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的彩色纪录片。
    “真理报”、“消息报”和苏联其他报纸每天接到许多读者来信。“真理报”编辑部说：“读者们反映了整个苏联人民的感情，热烈赞许苏联领导人员访问的结果，温暖感人地写了关于苏联、中国、印度、缅甸、阿富汗和其他爱好和平国家的人民的友谊。苏联人民真诚地愿望友好的亚洲人民在和平建设中获得成就。”
    顿巴斯矿工伏留卡洛在“真理报”上写道：
  “布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在亚洲国家的访问，大大加强了和平阵线。伟大的中国人民和伟大的印度人民同苏联人民一起为和平而斗争。苏联、中华人民共和国和印度的友好合作，这是巨大的力量。”吉尔吉斯共和国亚拉麦丁国营农场工人别克捷木巴耶夫写道：“和我们一起，印度、缅甸、阿富汗以及许多其他国家坚决要求给予中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。全体苏联人民热烈赞许这个，并且祝贺布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同志访问亚洲国家的结果。这次访问使爱好和平的人民更加紧密地接近。”拉脱维亚共和国诗人杨·苏德拉布昆写道：“由苏联领导人员——友好使者的丰富成果所带来的全世界千百万人们的高兴，惹起了某些西方社会政治活动家和反动报刊的恼怒。可是他们的恶毒只是新的证据，说明无论狡猾巧妙地编造的奸计，无论笨拙的实力恐吓，无论对真理的曲解，或是对自由的人民之间友好合作的拥护者的卑鄙毁谤，都不能帮助殖民者。殖民体系正在崩溃。亚洲国家几万万人打破了殖民者的枷锁，走上了建设新的自由生活的道路。”
