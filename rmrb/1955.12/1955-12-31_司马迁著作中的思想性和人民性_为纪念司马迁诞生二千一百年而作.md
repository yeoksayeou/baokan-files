    The Ideological and Popular Nature of Sima Qian's Works
    ——Written in Commemoration of the 2100th Anniversary of Sima Qian's Birth 
    Hou Wailu
    The great ancient Chinese historian and writer Sima Qian was born in 145 BC, the fifth year of Emperor Jing of Han's Zhongyuan era, which is now 2100 years ago. There are two views about Sima Qian's birth year. Generally, it is believed that he was born in 145 BC; but some records say that he was born in 135 BC, the sixth year of Emperor Wu of Han's Jianyuan era. Here, the former statement is followed. His death year is not clearly recorded, but it was around 90 BC.
    Sima Qian's works are full of popular and ideological nature. It not only summarized the achievements of previous scholars, so-called "after the Six Classics, only this work (Historical Records)," but also educated the Chinese people for a long time. Sima Qian's creative and excellent academic tradition has made scholars in China for more than two thousand years give him a high evaluation and absorb spiritual nourishment from his valuable experience. Even in modern times, Lu Xun praised the Historical Records as "the unsurpassed masterpiece of historians." Sima Qian's courage to expose the internal contradictions of feudal society also made the representative scholars of the feudal orthodox school after him feel threatened, either openly slandering his works as "seditious books" or distorting his thoughts as "heresy." Therefore, there have always been two attitudes towards Sima Qian's legacy, which have directly or indirectly reflected the struggle in the ideological field in China for more than two thousand years. We commemorate this great ideological fighter, scholar, and historian of more than two thousand years ago, and should follow Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, scientifically study and summarize all his knowledge, and absorb its essence.
    Sima Qian wrote the "Grand Historian's Records" with a lifetime of energy, which is called "Records of the Grand Historian" by later generations, and is compiled at the head of the Twenty-Four Histories. This is a work that inherits the tradition of the Hundred Schools of Thought in the Warring States Period, and it runs counter to what the court scholars and doctoral officials of the time did and thought. In this unprecedented general history, including about three thousand years of history from the Yellow Emperor to Emperor Wu of Han, it is divided into twelve Benji (similar to political history), ten Biao (similar to chronology), eight Shu (similar to social system history), thirty Shijia (similar to national history and biographical history), and seventy Liezhuan (similar to biographical history and intellectual history), a total of one hundred and thirty articles. These are the "five styles" as mentioned by later generations such as Zheng Qiao, which pioneered the "biographical style" of Chinese historians. From the form of the Historical Records, there is undoubtedly no such complete historical work in the world's works of the second century BC. From the content of the Historical Records, it can be said that Sima Qian, a genius of great talent, attempted to compile a summary of the historical picture of three thousand years that predecessors could not do, especially attempting to create a "veritable record" of the contemporary social picture since the rise of the Han Dynasty that contemporary scholars dared not do. On this point, even Ban Gu, who disagreed with Sima Qian's thoughts, could not help but admire him through the words of others and say: "His writing is straightforward, his affairs are verified, he does not falsely praise, nor does he conceal evil, so it is called a veritable record." Sima Qian's historical vision is indeed remarkable: the evolution of the times and systems, the living conditions of the nation, the faces of people in class society, and the development trends of ideological trends are all vividly depicted by him in a variety of literary ways. As for the classical realist literature expressed in the Historical Records, it has also had a huge impact on later generations of literature. Gu Tinglin said in Volume 26 of "Daily Knowledge Records" that "ancient historians have the ability to see their meaning in the order of events without waiting for judgment, and only the Grand Historian can do it." This is only talking about one side of Sima Qian's literature. Lu Xun described the Historical Records as "Li Sao without rhyme" in "A Brief History of Han Literature," which can be said to be a general literary evaluation.
    This short article does not allow for a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the Historical Records. Here, based on the author's limited research, I will try to briefly explain my personal views from the ideological and popular nature of Sima Qian's works.
    Sima Qian is one of the great thinkers of ancient Chinese naive materialism. First of all, Sima Qian held a simple materialistic view of nature. He understood astronomy and calendar, and also participated in the revision of the calendar in the era of Emperor Wu. His worldview was linked to his scientific knowledge. In his time, bizarre worldviews such as Yin-Yang and the Five Elements were extremely rampant and became the theories used by the ruling class of the Han Dynasty. Sima Qian, who adhered to the materialistic viewpoint, launched a struggle against these superstitious ideas. He explained that his purpose in writing the calendar was to make "the laws and calendars govern each other, and there is no room for even a moment (second)." He valued the usefulness of arithmetic. He said, "The books of stellar energy are mostly mixed with omens and are not canonical." He wrote "Heavenly Officials" to oppose these things. Based on his father's teachings, he put forward a materialistic view of natural history. In "Preface to the Grand Historian's Records," there is a passage of famous words of naive materialism that is worth noting:
    "The Yin and Yang, the four seasons, the eight positions, the twelve degrees, and the twenty-four solar terms each have their teachings and orders. Those who follow them prosper, and those who go against them either do not die or perish, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, it is said that it makes people constrained and fearful. Spring brings life, summer brings growth, autumn brings harvest, and winter brings storage. This is the great principle of the way of heaven. If you do not follow it, there is no way to establish the framework of the world. Therefore, it is said that the great order of the four seasons must not be lost." Sima Qian's worldview opposes the worldview of the interaction between heaven and man. He criticized Zou Yan, a Yin-Yang scholar who inherited Mencius, and accused Zou Yan of fueling the superstitious ideas of "engaging in sorcery and believing in omens" between the Qin and Han dynasties. Based on this worldview, he excavated the absurd legends of ancient China. He said, "Therefore, when speaking of the mountains and rivers of Kyushu, the Book of Documents is close to it; as for the monsters in the Yu Benji (now lost) and the Classic of Mountains and Seas, I dare not speak of them." He further accepted Xunzi's tradition, denied ancient myths, and criticized the rumors of people in the Han Dynasty, "Scholars mostly praise the Five Emperors, which is ancient; however, the Book of Documents only records since Yao, and the scholars speak of the Yellow Emperor, but their writing is not elegant, and the senior gentlemen find it difficult to speak of it."
    Although Sima Qian vaguely described in "The Biographies of Confucian Scholars" the purpose of Dong Zhongshu, a theological master of the Han Dynasty, in governing the Gongyang School's Spring and Autumn Annals, using the superstition of Yin-Yang disasters to please Emperor Wu, he did not clearly reveal his criticism of the Gongyang School in his words, but in "The Biography of Boyi," he issued a profound satire on this view of the way of heaven. He first talked about why some good people in ancient times starved to death and some died young. Why did he say that "Heaven rewards good people"? Why did the bad people in ancient times run rampant and kill people, but they lived long lives? Then he talked about the Han Dynasty, where bad people did bad things without any scruples, but enjoyed wealth and passed it on to their descendants for the rest of their lives; good people carefully restrained their words and deeds and dared not easily do anything that they were dissatisfied with, but most of them suffered disasters. Finally, he said: "I am very confused! Is the so-called way of heaven right or wrong?" From this passage, we can see how Sima Qian attacked the theological views that occupied the ruling position at that time. Engels said in "Dialectics of Nature" that ancient materialists hardly talked about gods and monsters, but simply explained natural things. Sima Qian was like this, and he introduced his father's teachings, saying, "If form (matter) and spirit (consciousness) are separated, then death will occur, and the dead cannot be reborn, and the separated cannot be returned." This centrally expresses his simple materialistic viewpoint.
    Secondly, let us look at Sima Qian's social and historical views. Although Sima Qian did not summarize his historical views into a systematic theory, this is not enough to damage the organically linked historical views expressed in the Historical Records. We should say that Sima Qian did not specifically write an article (including the Preface to the Historical Records) to abstractly describe his historical views, but he had the historical views in the Historical Records, in other words, he had the historical views that run through the social history and the records of various classes of people. Although this view is sometimes obscure and difficult to distinguish, it is not difficult for us to see from a comprehensive analysis the naive materialism and dialectical elements contained in his historical views.
    We know that the views of ancient materialists on the natural world were materialistic, but once they entered the complex social field, they mostly fell into idealistic views. Of course, our study of Sima Qian's historical views cannot be separated from the era in which he lived. Sima Qian's historical views inevitably have limitations, that is, they inevitably reveal idealistic components, such as the theory of cycles (such as the saying that the three dynasties are like cycles) and the emphasis on geographical conditions (such as the views on customs discussed in the Biographies of Money-Makers); however, his social thought has a distinct popular nature and elements of a materialistic worldview. In "The Biographies of Money-Makers," he has the following famous remarks on the history of human material life production:
    "Waiting for farmers to eat, miners to produce, workers to make, and merchants to circulate, how can there be government education, requisitions, or scheduled meetings? People each do their best according to their abilities to get what they want. Therefore, things that are cheap will become expensive, and things that are expensive will become cheap. People are encouraged to pursue their careers and enjoy their work, like water flowing downward, day and night without rest. They come without being summoned, and the people produce them without being sought. Is this not in accordance with the Way and a natural proof?"
    Obviously, this is treating the history of material production as a natural history that is independent of human will. Like natural phenomena, it also has certain laws (the Way) to follow. This is not determined by human will or political education, as generally said by idealists. It should be pointed out that this is a simple materialistic historical view. It is indeed outstanding and rare to have such a great idea in the analysis of human social history more than two thousand years ago. Therefore, he also valued the status of ordinary people in history, and surprisingly placed Bai Gui, an ordinary person engaged in production, on an equal footing with ancient great politicians and military strategists. He quoted Bai Gui as saying: "My (Bai Gui) management of production is like the planning of Yi Yin and Lü Shang, the use of troops by Sun Tzu and Wu Qi, and the implementation of law by Shang Yang."
    Sima Qian discovered that the class enslavement of people by people caused by unequal wealth is an inevitable phenomenon, just like the laws of nature. He said: "Among the common people, if the rich are ten times richer, they will be humbled; if they are a hundred times richer, they will be feared; if they are a thousand times richer, they will be employed; if they are ten thousand times richer, they will be enslaved. This is the principle of things." He opposed wealth obtained through commercial exploitation and coercion, saying that "original wealth (referring to wealth earned through labor) is the best, secondary wealth (referring to wealth earned through commerce) is second, and treacherous wealth (referring to wealth earned through exploitation) is the worst." This view is diametrically opposed to the feudal orthodox view that holds that nobility, lowliness, poverty, and wealth are "ordained by heaven."
    Sima Qian boldly declared that the law is a tool for governing people. He wrote a story about the Confucian scholar Shusun Tong establishing etiquette for Emperor Gaozu of Han. First, he explained that the masters who formulated etiquette and law were such despicable figures, that is, "so-called 'sages' who 'are difficult to advance with but can be relied upon to maintain', who 'flatter to gain favor' and 'know the affairs of the time'"; secondly, he described a fake scene of Tong putting on a big comedy for the emperor; finally, he said, "Emperor Gaozu said, I know today the nobility of being an emperor." As a result, the master of etiquette establishment, Shusun Tong, was appointed as Taichang, and was given five hundred catties of gold, and a group of Confucian scholars who followed him were also made Lang officials and were rewarded with gold. This is the inside story of Shusun Tong's establishment of etiquette. Originally, in the narration of this specific example, Sima Qian ruthlessly exposed the hypocrisy of this "etiquette"! Sima Qian's specific narration of Zhang Tang formulating various laws for Emperor Wu of Han is another kind of exposure. Zhang Tang was a master at formulating laws for Emperor Wu. He formulated many autocratic decrees to maintain the feudal system. As long as Emperor Wu liked it, Zhang Tang would adapt the classics to cater to him. Therefore, at that time, "all the affairs of the world were decided by (Zhang) Tang"; however, Sima Qian boldly said that because of such laws, the people could not live in peace when Zhang Tang was alive, and they wanted to "stir up trouble". After Zhang Tang died, "the people did not miss him"! From this, we can understand that Sima Qian had already seen the hypocrisy of the laws of the feudal system, that is, on the one hand, it was a system covered in a sacred cloak, and on the other hand, it was a shameless and illegal seizure. He also borrowed Ji An's words to describe Emperor Wu of Han, saying, "Your Majesty has many desires internally, but outwardly practices benevolence and righteousness." This pointed out the essence of the so-called "benevolence, righteousness, and morality" of the rulers!
    The tyranny of the ruling class is exposed a lot in "Treatise on Price Stabilization" and "The Biographies of Cruel Officials". His portrayal of the general finance ministers and a group of cruel officials not only gives readers vivid and typical images, but also exposes the basic contradictions between the ruling class and the ruled class in feudal society. Engels once pointed out that excellent literature can express a richer and more diverse picture of society than sociological statistics, public law, and we believe that Sima Qian's excellent tradition has both aspects. Here, let us look again at how the cruel Du Zhou defined feudal law. Someone questioned Du Zhou, saying, "You do not follow the law, but specialize in governing prisons according to the likes and dislikes of the ruler. Is this how the law enforcers are?" Du Zhou said: "Where does the three feet (law) come from? What the former ruler thought was right was written into law; what the later ruler thought was right was written as an edict. What is right at the time, what ancient law is there?" This also exposes that the so-called sacred law at that time was a tool for arbitrarily killing the people under Sima Qian's pen. On the one hand, "Treatise on Price Stabilization" shows that the highest landlords confiscated a large amount of the people's wealth, land, and slaves, causing most of the middle class and above to go bankrupt, indicating that a few privileged powerful landlords "hoarded wealth and enslaved the poor", causing the peasants to fall into deep water; on the other hand, "The Biographies of Cruel Officials" points out that peasant uprisings, famous great riots, and countless small riots rose and fell, threatening the rule of the Han Dynasty, scaring the ruling class to "hide each other up and down, and avoid the law with rhetoric."
    Based on this ideological foundation of naive materialistic historical view, Sima Qian's works inevitably have rich popular nature. In addition to the above-mentioned views on social systems, class laws, etc. have expressed its popular nature, we can also see from Sima Qian's works that its popular nature is manifested in moral viewpoints. He pointed out that the morality of people with wealth and power is based on the standards of power seizure and wealth plundering. He said, "Villagers have a saying, 'How to know benevolence and righteousness? Those who have enjoyed their benefits are virtuous.'...Those who steal a hook are punished, and those who steal a country are made marquises, and benevolence and righteousness exist in the door of the marquises." Their identities are the so-called "cliques, strong factions, colluding, setting up wealth to enslave the poor, and powerful and tyrannical to invade the isolated and weak, indulging their desires for self-satisfaction." He also pointed out that the morality of the oppressed and the ruled is based on the standards of equal reciprocity and relief in times of distress. He said, "People from the cloth, setting up giving and taking promises, reading righteousness thousands of miles away, and disregarding the world for death...Therefore, the poor and distressed scholars are entrusted with their lives. Is this not what people call virtuous and heroic? If the heroes of the countryside, comparing the power and strength of Yu Jici and Yuan Xian, and showing their merits to the present world, they will not be discussed on the same day...Although they sometimes offend the laws of the present world, their private righteousness, integrity, humility, and concession are worthy of praise. Their names are not established in vain, and the scholars are not attached in vain." From this, it can be seen that Sima Qian made a ruthless exposure of the morality of the rulers and made a lofty praise of the morality of the people.
    Not only that, but he also listed many contemporary knights, who were opposed to the powerful and tyrannical landlord class. Their qualities, such as Zhu Jia, were "rescuing people who were not well-off, starting from the poor and lowly", and their qualities, such as Guo Jie, were "rescuing people's lives without boasting of their merits." The reason why Sima Qian wrote biographies for these lower-level figures is because they are different from ordinary rich people, "their words are trustworthy, their actions are resolute, their promises are sincere, they do not love their bodies, they rush to the plight of scholars, and they have already determined life and death, but they do not boast of their abilities or be ashamed of their virtues." Let us look at the story he narrated about the Chen She uprising. He said, "Jie and Zhou lost their way and Tang and Wu arose, Zhou lost its way and the Spring and Autumn Annals were written, Qin lost its government and Chen She emerged." In this way, the peasant uprising led by Chen She is equal to the Tang and Wu "holy kings" who created the Shang and Zhou dynasties in traditional thought, and the Spring and Autumn Annals written by Confucius, the "uncrowned king", which set laws for all ages. It was also a pioneering work to include the peasant leader Chen She in the aristocratic families. Although Emperor Gaozu of Han was listed in Benji, Sima Qian's satire on this emperor was profound, and he even described him as a "rascal." Although Sima Qian had some taboos in form and could not avoid his words, saying that the "royal way of the three dynasties is like a cycle," once he got into his specific narration, he turned it upside down and treated the bandits who were scolded by the rulers as if they were holy kings.
    In particular, it should be pointed out that Sima Qian recorded a large amount of the lives of ordinary people in his works, which shows that Sima Qian regarded the lives of the people as the historical subject and research object. This is an unprecedented contribution.
    Finally, we know that in the era of the writing of the Historical Records, Confucianism had been declared by the Han Dynasty as a kind of orthodoxy similar to the state religion. By means of this orthodoxy, as Dong Zhongshu's countermeasures said, the Hundred Schools of Thought were not allowed to advance together, and then the system could be unified. However, Sima Qian stood on the opposite side of praising the Six Classics, treating the Six Classics and the traditions of the Hundred Schools of Thought equally, without distinction. This is also his unique scientific judgment.
    We commemorate Sima Qian, the great and creative historian and writer of genius, and should study his great works and accept this rich historical legacy.

    司马迁著作中的思想性和人民性
    ——为纪念司马迁诞生二千一百年而作 
    侯外庐
    中国古代伟大的历史家和文学家司马迁生于公元前一四五年，即汉景帝中元五年，到现在已经两千一百年了。关于司马迁的生年，过去有两说。一般认为他生于公元前一四五年；但也有的记载说他生于公元前一三五年，即汉武帝建元六年。这里是照前一种说法。他的死年没有明确的记载，大约是在公元前九○年左右。
    司马迁的著作充满了人民性和思想性，它不但总结了前代学人的成果，所谓“六经以后，惟有此作（史记）”，而且长期教育了中国人民。司马迁的富有创造性的优良学术传统，使中国二千多年的学者没有不给予他以崇高的评价，并从他的宝贵经验里吸取精神的营养。直到近代，鲁迅也赞美史记是
  “史家之绝唱”。司马迁暴露封建社会内部矛盾的胆识，又使他以后的封建正统派代表学者大都感到威胁，或者公开地诬蔑他的著作为“谤书”，或者曲解他的思想为“异端”。因此，对待司马迁的遗产，从来就有两种态度直接间接地反映在中国二千多年的思想领域的斗争中。我们纪念这位两千多年前伟大的思想战士、学者和历史家，应该遵从毛泽东同志的教导，把他的全部学问，加以科学的研究和总结，吸取它的精华。
    司马迁用一生精力所写成的著作“太史公书”，即后人所称的编于二十四史首部的“史记”。这是一部继承战国时代诸子百家传统的著述，它和当时御用学者博士官们所做的和所想的都是背道而驰的。在这一部史无前例的通史中，包括着从黄帝到汉武帝为止的约三千年历史，分为十二本纪（近似于政治史）、十表（近似于年表）、八书（近似于社会制度史）、三十世家（近似于国别史和人物传记）、七十列传（近似于人物传记和思想史），共一百三十篇。这些就是后人如郑樵所说的“五体”，开创中国史家“纪传体”的先河。从史记的形式来看，在公元前二世纪的世界著作中无疑地没有这样比较完整的史学著作。从史记的内容来看，可以说天才纵横的司马迁，企图对三千年的历史图景编制出前人所不能作的总结，特别是企图把汉兴以来的当代社会图景，创制出当代学者所不敢做的“实录”。在这一点，连那不同意司马迁思想的班固，也不能不借他人的口吻而叹服地说：“其文直，其事核，不虚美，不隐恶，故谓之实录。”司马迁的史学眼光确是嶙峋不凡的：时代制度的演变、民族的生活状况、阶级社会的人物面貌、思想潮流的发展倾向，都生动地被他用多种多样的文学方式描画出来。至于史记所表现的古典现实主义文学，对于后代文学同样发生了巨大的影响。顾亭林在“日知录”卷二十六中说，“古人作史有不待论断而序事之中即见其指者，惟太史公能之。”这还只是说到司马迁文学的一面。鲁迅在“汉文学史纲”中形容史记是“无韵之离骚”，可以说是概括的文学评价。
    这篇短文不允许对于史记作全面的分析评价，这里仅就作者有限的研究，试从司马迁著作中的思想性和人民性，来简括地说明一下个人的看法。
    司马迁是中国古代朴素的唯物主义的伟大思想家之一。首先，司马迁对自然是抱着一种素朴的唯物观点的。他懂得天文星历，也参加过武帝时代修订历法的工作。他的世界观是和他的科学知识联结在一起的。在他的时代，阴阳五行一类怪诞的世界观极其嚣张，成了汉代统治阶级御用的理论。坚持唯物观点的司马迁对这些迷信的思想展开了斗争。他说明他作历书是在于使“律历更相治，间不容翲（秒）忽”。他重视算术的功用。他说，“星气之书，多杂禨祥，不经”。他著“天官者”就是为了反对这些东西。他根据父亲的遗教，提出对待自然史的唯物观点。在“太史公自序”中有一段值得重视的朴素的唯物主义的名言：
    “夫阴阳四时八位十二度二十四节，各有教令，顺之者昌，逆之者不死则亡，未必然也。故曰，使人拘而多畏。夫春生夏长秋收冬藏，此天道之大经也，弗顺则无以为天下纲纪，故曰，四时之大顺，不可失也。”司马迁的这种世界观是反对天人感应的世界观的。他批判了继承孟子的阴阳家驺衍，他责斥驺衍助长了秦汉之间“营于巫祝，信禨祥”的迷信思想。他以这一世界观为根据，对中国古代的荒诞传说加以抉剔。他说“故言九州山川，尚书近之矣；至禹本纪（按已佚）、山海经所有怪物，余不敢言之也。”他更接受荀子的传统，否认远古的神话，批判了汉代人们的造谣，“学者多称五帝，尚矣；然尚书独载尧以来，而百家言黄帝，其文不雅驯，荐绅先生难言之。”
    司马迁在“儒林列传”中虽然委婉地记述着汉代神学大师董仲舒治公羊家春秋的目的，拿阴阳灾变的迷信以取悦于武帝，语句间并没有明白地显露出他对公羊家的批判来，但在“伯夷列传”中，他却对这种天道观发出了深刻的讽刺。他首先讲到古代的好人有的饿死、有的夭亡，为什么说“天之报施善人”？古代的坏人横行杀人却得长寿，这又是什么道理呢？接着他说到汉代，坏人毫无忌惮地干坏事，却一辈子享受富贵，并把富贵传给子孙；好人谨拘言行，什么不满意的事也不敢轻易做，却多数遭了祸灾。最后他说：“余甚惑焉！傥所谓天道，是邪非邪？”从这一段文字中，我们可以看出司马迁是怎样攻击当时居于统治地位的神学观点了。恩格斯在“自然辩证法”中说，古代唯物主义者，几乎不谈神怪，而是单纯解释自然事物。司马迁就是这样，他介绍他父亲的遗训说“形（物质）神（精神）离则死，死者不可复生，离者不可复反”。这集中地表现了他的素朴唯物观点。
    其次，我们再看看司马迁的社会历史观点。司马迁虽然没有把他的历史观点概括成为有体系的学说，然而这毫不足以损害史记所表现的有机联系着的历史观点。我们应该这样说，司马迁没有专门的
  一篇（包括史记自序）抽象地讲述他的历史观点，可是他有着史记里的历史观点，换言之，他有着贯串于社会历史的和各阶级人物的记录中所显示的历史观点，这种观点虽然有时隐约难辨，但我们从全面的分析中还不难看出他的历史观点所包含的朴素的唯物主义和辩证的因素。
    我们知道，古代唯物主义者对自然界的观点是唯物主义的，而一进入复杂的社会领域则大都陷入唯心主义观点。当然，我们研究司马迁的历史观点不能离开他所处的时代，司马迁的历史观点不能不有局限性，即不能不露出属于唯心主义的成分，例如循环论（如说三代若循环）和强调地理条件的说法（如在货殖列传中所论的风俗观点）；然而他的社会思想是有鲜明的人民性和唯物主义的世界观因素的。他在“货殖列传”中，关于人类物质生活资料的生产史有如下的名论：
    “待农而食之，虞（鑛）而出之，工而成之，商而通之，此宁有政教发征期会哉？人各任其能，竭其力，以得所欲。故物，贱之征贵，贵之征贱，各劝其业，乐其事，若水之趋下，日夜无休时，不召而自来，不求而民出之。岂非道之所符，而自然之验耶！”
    很明显，这是把物质生产的历史当作不以人的意志为转移的自然史去看待的。它和自然现象一样，也有一定的规律（道）可寻。这就不是如一般唯心主义者所说的决定于人的意志或政治教育之类。应该指出，这是一种素朴的唯物历史观点。二千多年前对人类社会史的分析方面有这样伟大的思想，的确是杰出而罕见的。因此，他也重视普通人民在历史中的地位，把一个平常从事生产的白圭，居然和古代的大政治家和军事家平列起来。他引述白圭的话说：“吾（白圭）治生产，犹伊尹、吕尚之谋，孙、吴用兵，商鞅行法是也。”
    司马迁发现由于财富不均而产生的人对人的阶级奴役是一种必然的现象，和自然的规律一样。他说：“凡编户之民，富相什、则卑下之；佰、则畏惮之；千则役，万则仆；物之理也。”他反对经商剥削和巧取豪夺而得来的财富，说“本富（指劳动而富）为上，末富（指商贾而富）次之，奸富（指榨取而富）最下”。这种观点是和那种认为贵贱贫富是“天命”的封建主义正统观点截然对立的。
    司马迁大胆地宣告法律是一种治人的工具。他有一篇叙述儒家叔孙通替汉高祖定礼的故事，首先说明制定礼法的大师是这样的卑劣人物，即“难与进取，可与守成”的、“面谀以得亲”的所谓“知当世之务的圣人”；其次叙述了一通为皇帝大排喜剧的假场面；最后说“高祖曰，吾乃今日知为皇帝之贵也”。于是乎定礼大师叔孙通被任命为太常，受赐金五百斤，一群追随他的儒生也都做了郎官并受了赏金。这就是所谓叔孙通定礼的内幕。原来，司马迁在这个具体事例的叙述中，无情地揭发了这种“礼”的虚伪！司马迁对于张汤为汉武帝制定各种法度的具体叙述，又是一种暴露。张汤是为武帝立法的能手，他定了不少维持封建制度的专制法令，只要武帝喜欢，张汤都会附会经义来迎合，因此，当时“天下事皆决于（张）汤”；然而司马迁却大胆地说出，正因为这样的法律，张汤在世时，百姓已经不能安生，要“骚动”了，张汤死后，“而民不思”！从这里，我们可以了解司马迁已经看到封建制度的法律的虚伪，即一方面是披着神圣外衣的制度，而另一方面是无耻的非法横夺。他还借汲黯的话形容汉武帝说，“陛下内多欲，而外施仁义”，这是一语道破了统治者所谓“仁义道德”的实质！
    对于统治阶级的横暴，在“平准书”和“酷吏列传”中揭发得很多。他对于一般财政大臣们和一群酷吏人物的描绘，不仅给读者以生动的典型形象，而且由此暴露出封建社会的统治阶级和被统治阶级的基本矛盾。恩格斯曾指出优秀的文学要比社会学统计学公法学更能表露出社会的丰富而多样的图景，我们以为司马迁的优良传统在两方面是兼而有之的。这里，我们再看一下酷暴的杜周怎样为封建法律下了一个定义。有人责问杜周，你不遵循法律，专门以人主的好恶来治狱，执法的人是这样么？杜周说：“三尺（法律）安出哉？前主所是、著为律；后主所是、疏为令，当时为是，何古之法乎？”这又暴露了当时所谓神圣的法律在司马迁的笔下就是任意杀害人民的工具。一方面“平准书”说明了最高地主大量没收了人民的财富、土地和奴婢，使中家以上大率破产，说明了少数特权豪强地主“蹛财役贫”，使农民陷于水深火热之中；另一方面“酷吏列传”指出了农民起义，著名的大暴动和不可胜数的小暴动此落彼起，威胁汉代的统治，吓得统治阶级“上下相为匿，以文辞避法焉。”
    在这种朴素的唯物主义历史观的思想基础上，司马迁的著作必然具有丰富的人民性。除了上面所说的对社会制度和阶级的法律等等观点已经表现了它的人民性以外，我们从司马迁著作中还可以看到它的人民性在道德观点方面的表现。他指出，有财富有权势的人的道德，它是以权力的窃取和财富的掠夺为标准的。他说，“鄙人有言曰、‘何知仁义？已飨（享）其利者为有德。’…窃钩者诛，窃国者侯，侯之门仁义存。”他们的身份是所谓“朋党宗强比周，设财役贫，豪暴侵凌孤弱，恣欲自快。”他还指出，被压迫者被统治者的道德，它是以平等的报施和患难的恤救为标准的。他说，“布衣之徒，设取予然诺，千里诵义，为死不顾世，……故士穷窘而得委命，此岂非人之所谓贤豪间者耶？诚使乡曲之侠，予季次、原宪比权量力，效功于当世，不同日而论矣。……虽时扞当世之文罔，然其私义廉洁退让，有足称者。名不虚立，士不虚附。”由此可见，司马迁对于统治者的道德作了无情的暴露，对于人民群众的道德作了崇高的颂扬。
    不但这样，他还列举了当代的许多任侠人物，他们是和豪暴地主阶级对立的。他们如朱家的品质是“振人不赡，先从贫贱始”，如郭解的品质是“振人之命，不矜其功”。司马迁之所以为这些下层人物立传，就是因为他们和一般富贵人们不同，“其言必信，其行必果，已诺必诚，不爱其躯，赴士之厄困，既已存亡生死矣，而不矜其能，羞伐其德”。我们再从他叙述陈涉起义的故事来看，他说“桀纣失其道而汤武作，周失其道而春秋作，秦失其政而陈涉发迹。”这样看来，陈涉领导的农民起义，和传统思想所谓的汤武“圣王”开创商周二代的王朝以及孔子“素王”著作垂法万世的春秋是等量齐观的。他把农民领袖陈涉列入世家，也是创举。汉高祖虽然被列在本纪，但司马迁对这位皇帝的讽刺是入骨的，甚至叙述他是“无赖”。司马迁虽然在形式上因有所忌讳，而不能不规避其词，说什么“三代若循环”的王道，然而一到了他的具体叙述里，便反而倒转过来，把统治者所骂的盗贼俨然当成圣王了。
    特别应该指出的是，司马迁在他的著作中，大量地记录了普通人民的生活，这正表现了司马迁是把人民的生活作为历史主体和研究对象的。这是一个史无前例的贡献。
    最后，我们知道，在史记写作的年代里，儒家已经被汉王朝宣布为一种类似国教的正宗，借此正宗，才如董仲舒的对策所说的，不使百家并进，而后统纪可一。然而，司马迁却站在表章六经的反对方面，把六经和诸子百家的传统一样看待，而无差别。这也是他独到的科学论断。
    我们纪念伟大的富有创造天才的历史家和文学家司马迁，应该研究他的伟大著作，接受这份丰富的历史遗产。
