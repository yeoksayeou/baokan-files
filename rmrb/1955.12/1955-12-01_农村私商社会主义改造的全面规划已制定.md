    Comprehensive Plan for the Socialist Transformation of Rural Private Merchants Formulated

    The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives convened the Third National Rural Private Merchant Transformation Work Conference in Beijing from November 21st to 28th. The conference formulated a comprehensive plan for the socialist transformation of rural private merchants. This comprehensive plan, based on the new demands that the agricultural cooperativization movement placed on the transformation of rural private merchants and rural trade, and based on the needs of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in the cities, determined the speed of progress in the transformation of rural private merchant work. At the same time, it made provisions for issues such as the organizational structure for leading the transformation of private merchants, the organizational forms of transformation, the quality of transformation work, and the planning and adjustment of the commercial network.

    Currently, there are 2.67 million rural private merchants nationwide (including small vendors and commercial capitalists). According to the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives' estimates, by the end of the year, 890,000 rural private merchants will have undergone various forms of transformation. Among them, those adopting major transformation forms such as cooperative shops (cooperative groups), jointly operated shops by supply and marketing cooperatives and private merchants, and consignment sales, account for 40 percent, while those adopting distribution and distribution group transformation forms account for 60 percent. The conference believes that accelerating the transformation of rural private merchants is possible. At present, most of the more than 1.1 million grassroots supply and marketing cooperative cadres nationwide have, through a year of work, grasped the policies for the transformation of private merchants and accumulated experience. The transformed private merchants have demonstrated advantages in operation, which has greatly encouraged small vendors to take the socialist road. Socialist commerce already occupies an absolute advantage in the rural market. It is estimated that this year state-owned trade and supply and marketing cooperative trade will account for approximately 60 percent of retail sales and approximately 75 percent of purchases. At the same time, socialist commerce has established a grassroots commercial wholesale network in rural areas, with wholesale accounting for 70 to 80 percent. This situation provides favorable conditions for the transformation of rural private merchants and for formulating a comprehensive plan for this work.

    The conference believes that the leading ideology lagging behind reality is the main problem in the current transformation work of rural private merchants. Cheng Zihua, Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, said in his concluding report at the conference that this problem manifests itself in work as follows: the organizational transformation of rural private merchants lags far behind the development of rural wholesale business and lags behind the demands of small vendors for transformation. In his report, he criticized this right-leaning conservative thinking.

### 农村私商社会主义改造的全面规划已制定

    农村私商社会主义改造的全面规划已制定
    中华全国供销合作总社十一月二十一日到二十八日在北京召开全国第三次农村私商改造工作会议。会议作出了对于农村私商进行社会主义改造的全面规划。这个全面规划根据农业合作化运动对农村私商改造工作和农村贸易提出的新要求，根据城市资本主义工商业社会主义改造的需要，定出了改造农村私商工作的进展速度；同时对于领导私商改造的组织机构、改造的组织形式、改造工作的质量以及商业网的规划和调整等问题，作了规定。
    目前全国农村私商共有二百六十七万人（包括小商小贩和商业资本家）。根据中华全国供销合作总社的预计，到年底止，受到各种形式改造的农村私商将达到八十九万人。其中采取合作商店（合作小组）、由供销合作社和私商合营的商店、代购、代销等主要改造形式的占百分之四十，采取经销和经销小组改造形式的占百分之六十。会议认为，加速对农村私商的改造工作是可能的。目前，全国已经有一百一十多万个基层供销合作社干部经过一年来的工作，大部分领会了对私商改造工作的政策，积累了经验。经过改造的私商，在经营上显示了优越性，对于小商小贩走社会主义道路的积极性起了很大的鼓舞作用。社会主义商业在农村市场已经占绝对优势，预计今年国营贸易和供销合作社贸易在零售方面约占百分之六十，收购方面约占百分之七十五。同时，社会主义商业在农村建立了基层商业批发网，批发比重已经占百分之七十到八十。这种情况就是对农村私商改造工作，并且对这一工作作出全面的规划的有利条件。
    会议认为，领导思想落后于实际是当前农村私商改造工作中的主要问题。中华全国供销合作总社主任程子华在会议的总结报告中说，这个问题在工作上的表现是：对农村私商的组织改造远远落后于农村批发业务的发展，落后于小商小贩对改造的要求。他在报告中批判了这种右倾保守思想。
