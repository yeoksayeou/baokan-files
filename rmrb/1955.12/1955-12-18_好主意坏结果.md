    Good Idea, Bad Result
    In the Liutang pithead of the Benxi Coal Mine, there was an old, abandoned air duct on the verge of collapse, inside which was a 50-horsepower winch. The mine wanted to retrieve it, so that the state's property wouldn't be wasted.
    This was originally a very simple matter. All that was needed was to send someone to inspect and repair the supports of the air duct, and the winch could be pulled out. However, the Benxi Coal Mine complicated the matter. They instructed the Ventilation Section to be responsible for inspecting and repairing the supports, the Mechanical and Electrical Section to be responsible for removing the winch, and the Transportation Section to be responsible for cleaning the dirt and dust on the winch track. They thought that such a small matter handled by three sections shouldn't have any problems, right!? After “assigning responsibility,” they left it alone. Who knew that such fine division of labor, without organizing cooperation, would result in a "three monks having no water to drink" situation. The Ventilation Section sent people to repair the roof supports and notified the Mechanical and Electrical Section to quickly remove the winch, but the Mechanical and Electrical Section sat still, saying they were waiting for the Transportation Section to sweep the track. The Transportation Section said, "There isn't much dirt and dust on the track. The winch can be removed without sweeping. Even if there is dirt and dust, you can sweep it away while removing the winch! Why make such a big fuss?" The two sections pushed back and forth, and the newly repaired supports collapsed again. By the time the mine discovered that the winch had not been removed and redeployed workers to tidy up the air duct, the total cost of wages and materials had reached 2,300 yuan, which was more expensive than the value of a winch.
    In order to save state property, state property was wasted; what was originally a simple matter was complicated. This is the harm of bureaucracy and departmentalism.

    好主意坏结果
    本溪煤矿柳塘坑口有一个已经废弃将要倒塌的旧风道，风道里还有一台五十马力的绞车，矿上想把它取出来，不让国家财产白白扔掉。
    这本来是一件很简单的事情，只要派人把风道的棚子检查修整一下，这台绞车就推出来了。但是本溪煤矿反而把事情弄复杂了，他们责成通风科负责检查和修理棚子，责成机电科负责撤绞车，责成运输科负责清扫绞车轨道上的脏泥和风尘。原以为这么一件小事让三个科负责，该没有什么问题了吧！？“责成”之后就放下不管了。谁知分工精细却不组织大家合作，反而弄成“三个和尚没水吃”的局面。通风科派人修好顶棚，通知机电科赶快将绞车取出来时，机电科却坐着不动，说是要等运输科扫轨道，运输科却说：“轨道上的泥尘本来不多，不扫也能撤绞车，就是有泥尘你们撤车时顺便扫一扫也行呵！何必兴师动众呢？”两个科推来推去，刚修好的棚子又倒塌了，等到矿上发现绞车还没有撤，重新调了工人整理风道，连工资带材料费已用去二千三百元，比一台绞车的价值贵多了。
    为了节省国家财产，反而浪费了国家财产；本来很简单的事情反而弄复杂了，这就是官僚主义和本位主义的害处。
