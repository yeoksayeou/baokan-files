The phenomenon of arbitrary vehicle levies on farmers in the Tenth District of Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, is quite widespread. According to statistics, from March to mid-October this year, the district government levied vehicles from farmers 236 times. The tasks for which vehicles were levied included carrying district and village cadres to meetings in the county seat, transporting coal and fodder for the horse-raising station and the district government, and moving houses for district cadres. Generally, each village had to provide vehicles more than 20 times, some even up to 30 times. The total labor days spent on these vehicle levies in the district amounted to 1,014 horse labor days.

This area has relatively convenient transportation, and the state also allocates certain transportation expenses. Why does the district government still levy obligatory vehicles from the masses? Some people believe that it's nothing to levy a few obligatory vehicles, because the horses are raised by the farmers themselves, and the fodder is taken from home, so it doesn't cost much. They also say that levying some obligatory vehicles can save state funds. This idea is wrong, and this practice is illegal. Take going to the county to attend meetings as an example. The Thirteenth District of Keshan County is about 120 li from the county seat, but one can reach the county seat in a little over three hours by taking a state-owned bus for just eighteen li and spending a little over six jiao. Taking a horse-drawn cart takes a whole day, and the round trip takes three days. For an agricultural cooperative to provide an obligatory vehicle once, the food for the driver and the cost of fodder for the livestock on the way alone costs 16 yuan. The Victory Agricultural Cooperative of Sizuo Fang Village spent more than 100 yuan in half a year for providing obligatory vehicles. Not only that, but what the farmers are most dissatisfied with is that no matter how busy or free they are, the district government's demand for vehicles is always urgent, with instructions to "rush to the district."

The leading organs of Keshan County should check and correct this practice of levying vehicles from farmers.

    不应摊派“义务车”
    黑龙江省克山县第十区任意向农民派车的现象相当普遍。据统计，从今年三月到十月中旬，区公所向农民派了二百三十六台次车。派车的任务，有的是载区、村干部去县城开会，有的是给配马站和区公所运煤、运草料等，有的是给区干部搬家。一般的村都摊车二十次以上，有的竟达三十次。全区派这些车共用去马一千零十四个工日。
    这个地区交通比较方便，国家又开支一定的交通费，为什么区公所还要群众摊义务车呢？有人认为：摊几次义务车没啥，因为马是农民自己养的，草料从家里拿，不需要花什么钱。他们还说：派些义务车可以节省国家经费开支。这种思想是错误的，这种做法是非法的。拿上县开会来说，克山县十三区离县城约有一百二十里，但是只要走十八里地，花六角多钱坐国营公共汽车三个多小时便到县城了。坐大车要走一整天，往返就得三天。农业合作社摊一次义务车，仅赶车人的伙食和牲畜途中的草料费，就要花十六元。四座房村胜利农业合作社半年间为摊义务车就支出了一百多元。不仅这样，农民最不满意的是：不管忙闲，区公所要车都是刻不容缓，“火速到区”。
    克山县的领导机关，应该检查和纠正这种向农民派车的做法。
