    Beijing Builds First Parachute Tower
    A 54.17-meter reinforced concrete parachute tower has been erected on the beautiful Longtan Lake畔 (pàn - lakeside) near the Beijing Gymnasium. This is the first parachute tower built by the Central National Defense Sports Club in the capital.
    The parachute tower is beige. The top of the tower is equipped with a lightning rod, a wind vane, and a dazzling red five-pointed star. At 43 meters from the ground, three 11-meter-long steel arms extend from the tower body. Each steel arm is fitted with an 8.17-meter parachute ring, and different colored parachutes can be hung under the parachute ring, allowing three people to parachute at the same time. Inside the tower is a spiral staircase, which can be used to climb to the tower door for visits. This spacious parachute sports field covers a total area of 48.33 mu (Chinese unit of area, approximately 667 square meters per mu). The parachute tower is surrounded by a sand table with a diameter of 90 meters and a safety circle of 25 meters wide. There are also ancillary facilities such as a parachute folding room, a parachute drying room, a parachute classroom, a parachute warehouse, a studio, and night lighting equipment.
    Parachute tower jumping is one of the aviation sports. Participants need to be brave, resourceful, and have a strong physique. The parachute sports field is equipped with jumping platforms, iron swings, tension devices, rolling rings, aerial leaps and other sports equipment for young people participating in parachuting to use for preparatory exercises.
    The basic construction of the parachute tower has now been completed. Electric elevators are currently being installed and are scheduled to open in early 1956. (Qun Li)

    北京建立了第一座跳伞塔
    在北京体育馆附近美丽的龙潭湖畔，耸立起一座五十四点一七公尺的钢筋水泥跳伞塔。这是中央国防体育俱乐部在首都建立的第一座跳伞塔。
    跳伞塔是米黄色的。塔顶尖上装有避雷针、风向仪和鲜艳夺目的红五星。在距地面四十三公尺的塔身上，伸展着三只十一公尺长的钢臂，每只钢臂安装八点一七公尺的伞圈，伞圈下可挂各色的降落伞，每次可以有三人同时跳伞。塔身内设有转梯，可以经此登上塔门去参观。这个宽大的跳伞运动场，共占地四十八点三三亩，伞塔四周设有直径九十公尺的沙盘和二十五公尺宽的安全圈，还有叠伞室、晾伞室、伞学教室、降落伞仓库、工作室等附属设备和夜间照明设备。
    伞塔跳伞是航空运动项目之一。参加者需要勇敢、机智和有坚强的体质。跳伞运动场内设有跳台、铁鞦韆、拉力器、滚环、空中飞跃等运动器材，可供参加跳伞的青年作准备练习。
    现在跳伞塔的基本建筑已完成，现正安装电动升降机，预定在一九五六年初开放。（群力）
