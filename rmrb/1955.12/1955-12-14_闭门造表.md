    Making Tables Behind Closed Doors
    Fei Liwen
    The trainees of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory's Technical Training Class, after a year and three months of study, have all mastered the skills they learned and become second-grade technical workers. Now they are about to embark on new jobs and participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Their excitement is imaginable.

    What is worthy of gratitude is that the Fourth Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry (hereinafter referred to as the Fourth Bureau) had already arranged jobs for them before their graduation. The workplaces are distributed in four locations: Harbin, Nanchang, Weifang, and Shanghai. Some people inevitably have a feeling of leaving their hometown, but the trainees who are determined to obey the unified allocation do not take this issue to heart at all.

    The teachers and staff of the technical training class, like the trainees, are also very excited. Seeing their students, whom they have nurtured with all their heart, fly to distant places like strong young eagles to build the motherland, how can they not be happy? The teachers and trainees bid farewell to each other with joy.

    The teachers saw off 97 trainees assigned to the Shanghai Turbine Factory, the Xinzhong Power Machine Factory, and the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory; then they saw off 21 trainees going to Harbin and Weifang; now only the six trainees going to Nanchang are left. After they depart, the task of all allocation work will be completed. On the way back to the technical training class from the station, people could not help but praise the Fourth Bureau for doing a good job in the allocation work.

    However, just as their feet stepped into the gate of the technical training class, the telephone rang, and the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory made a long-distance call from thousands of miles away, saying that they did not need workers and told the training class not to send trainees there. What is going on? The official document sent by the Fourth Bureau in the morning clearly stipulated that eight trainees should be sent to Nanchang. Because the training class did not have enough people, it could only provide six, and they were still worried that they had not met the other party's requirements and were afraid that the other party would be unhappy! How could there be such a big change all of a sudden, not wanting even one person?

    "How can this be? The tickets have already been bought, and the luggage has already been sent. Besides, there is also the official document from the Fourth Bureau… If you have any inconveniences, it is best to contact our factory or the Fourth Bureau directly to discuss it." The director of the technical training class replied very sincerely.

    The other party felt that this made sense and transferred the call to another place.

    Listening to what the director was talking about with the other party, the smiles on everyone's faces disappeared unconsciously. Everyone was worried about the fate of these six trainees: "It was originally assigned, how could there be a sudden change?" But people always like to think positively, and everyone was secretly comforting themselves: "This may be an individual problem. Look, the overall distribution situation is not very good and smooth?"

    After a while, the personnel section of the factory called, saying that according to the opinion of the Fourth Bureau, the six trainees should still be sent to Nanchang according to the original plan. The dispute was resolved, and everyone felt that the Fourth Bureau was still very responsible.

    The allocation work was considered to be over. Logically speaking, the technical training class should be quieter after more than one hundred people left at once; but things were not like this, and constant letters and phone calls disturbed everyone, making them upset and distraught. What was it all about? It turned out that the trainees who had graduated and started working were complaining to the training class about their experiences.

    Now let us take a look at the experiences of the graduated trainees: Let's start with the Shanghai Turbine Factory. The most trainees were assigned to this factory, a total of 64. After this group of trainees arrived at the factory, they lived in the dormitory for five days. On the sixth day, the comrades from the personnel section of the factory came to formally announce the work. Before the announcement, he explained that they did not need lathe operators at all, and there were too many planers. What they lacked were milling, grinding, and boring workers. The lathe operators and planer trainees who were assigned this time were forcibly assigned to them by the Fourth Bureau. More than thirty of the fifty-four lathe operators and planer trainees had to change to milling, grinding, and boring workers. As a result, more than thirty trainees immediately changed their profession, and the skills they had spent more than a year learning with all their heart had to be put aside and started all over again.

    Let's look at the Xinzhong Power Machine Factory: This factory had fewer people changing jobs, but they did not have enough planer operators, so lathe operators turned into planer operators.

    Let's look at the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory: Five lathe operators were assigned to the repair shop to rub iron rust, because the products were about to leave the factory and there was a lack of odd-job ordinary workers.

    Having talked about Shanghai, let's talk about Shandong. It is said that before and after the allocation of work, neither a long-distance call from Weifang was received, nor was a letter of refusal received. It should have been worry-free. But things were not that simple. Five milling and planing trainees were arranged to be in the guesthouse as soon as they arrived in Weifang, letting them roam around freely. After they roamed around freely for nine days, the cadres of the cadres section smiled at them and said: "We don't need planers." Therefore, he asked three planing trainees to return to Shanghai to wait for reassignment (it is said that this was also according to the order of the Fourth Bureau). In order to properly send off these three travelers, in addition to giving them 30 yuan for travel expenses (including the purchased tickets), they spent an extra 30 yuan or so to buy sleeper tickets for the three. The three trainees walked on the way back home helplessly, saying sadly: "The country has spent so much travel expenses, is it just for us to see Mount Tai?" After they returned to the technical training class, the work had not been settled for a long time. One trainee said anxiously: "Xinzhong Power Machine Factory lacks planers but is not assigned, but goes to Shandong. Now it's good, I read books and sleep all day, and the Fourth Bureau doesn't even ask about it."

    The reader probably remembers the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory that called from thousands of miles away. What was the situation after the trainees arrived here? As soon as the accompanying personnel arrived at the factory, the comrades from the personnel section of the factory jumped up and said, "What? You still sent them here."

      "Yes, this is the order of the Fourth Bureau!" The accompanying personnel took out the official document of the Fourth Bureau, and the other party had to shake his head and sigh.

    What to do? Since people have come, you have to find a way! After careful study by the factory leaders, they felt that the workshop did not lack milling and planing workers, but temporarily lacked lathe operators. It seemed that the milling and planing workers had to be changed to lathe or grinding workers. When I write here, without the trainees speaking, dear readers, you will also shout loudly: "What is going on? Shanghai lathe operators change to milling workers, lathe operators change to planing workers, and Nanchang milling and planing workers have to change to lathe or grinding workers in turn. Wouldn't it be good to change them beforehand?" Unfortunately, the comrades of the Fourth Bureau who are responsible for the allocation work did not conduct a good investigation in advance. They only know how to sit in the office and make tables for allocating graduating students behind closed doors. Of course, they can only do such confused things!

    闭门造表
    费礼文
    上海柴油机厂技工训练班的学员，经过一年零三个月的学习，都掌握了所学的技术，成为二级技术工人了，现在他们就要走上新的工作岗位，参加祖国的社会主义建设，他们心情的兴奋是可以想见的。
    值得感谢的，是第一机械工业部第四机器工业管理局（以下简称四局）早在他们毕业之前就已经替他们安排好了工作。工作的地方分布在哈尔滨、南昌、潍坊、上海四个地方，有些人不免会有离乡背井的感觉，可是决心服从统一分配的学员们丝毫没有把这个问题放在心上。
    技工训练班的教师们和工作人员们，同学员们一样，也是非常兴奋的。看见自己尽心培养出来的学生，像矫健的鹰隼一样，雄赳赳地飞向远方，去建设祖国，还能不高兴吗？教师们和学员们怀着喜悦的心情，互相告别。
    教师们送走了分配在上海汽轮机厂和新中动力机厂、上海柴油机厂的九十七名学员；接着又送走了去哈尔滨和潍坊的二十一名学员；现在只剩下去南昌的六名学员了。他们动身以后，就完成了全部分配工作的任务。在从车站回技工训练班的途中，人们不禁再一次地称赞四局分配工作做得好。
    可是，当他们的脚刚刚踏进技工训练班的门口时，电话铃就叮铃铃地响了，南昌柴油机厂千里迢迢地打来了长途电话，说他们不需要工人，叫训练班不要送学员去。这到底是怎么回事呢？明明四局上午送来的公文规定送八名学员到南昌去，训练班因为人数不够，只能给六名，还耽心没有满足人家的要求，怕人家不高兴呢！怎么突然来一个大转变，连一个人都不要了呢？
    “这怎么行？车票已经买好了，行李也已经寄出了，何况还有四局的公文……你们如果有什么不方便的地方，最好跟我们厂或四局直接联系商量一下。”技工训练班主任很诚恳地回答。
    对方觉得这话说得对，就把电话转到别的地方去了。
    听着主任跟对方所谈的话，大家脸上的笑容，不知不觉地消失了。大家都为这六名学员的命运担忧起来：“本来都已分配定了，怎么突然又发生了变化呢？”不过人总是喜欢往好的方面想的，大家也还暗地里在安慰自己：“这可能是个别问题，你看，总的分配情况不是很好，很顺利吗？”
    隔了一会，厂里人事科打来电话，说是根据四局的意见，六名学员仍照原计划送到南昌。纠纷解决了，大家觉得四局还是很负责任。
    分配工作算是结束了。照理说，技工训练班一下子走了一百多人，会清静些了吧；可是事情却不是这样，不断的来信和电话扰得大家六神不安，心烦意乱。到底是为什么事情呢？原来是那些毕业后参加工作的学员们，来向训练班诉说他们的遭遇。
    现在就让我们看看毕业学员们的遭遇吧：先从上海汽轮机厂谈起。派到这个厂的学员最多，共有六十四名。这批学员到厂后，在宿舍里住了五天，第六天上，这个厂人事科的同志来正式宣布工作了。在宣布之前，他就作了解释，说他们根本不需要车工，刨工也嫌多，比较缺的是铣、磨、镗三种工人，这次分配来的车工、刨工学员是四局硬派给他们的。五十四个车工、刨工学员中要有三十几人改为铣工、磨工和镗工。于是，三十几个学员顿时改了行业，一年多花尽心血学习来的技术得丢在一旁，再从头学起。
    再看新中动力机厂吧：这个厂改工种的人数较少，不过他们却是刨工不够，于是乎车工又转成了刨工。
    再看看上海柴油机厂：五个车工派在修配车间擦铁锈，原因是产品要出厂，缺少打杂的普通工。
    谈了上海，再谈山东。照说在分配工作前后，既没接到潍坊的长途电话，又没碰上拒不接受的信，应该是高枕无忧的了。可是事情也并不这样简单。五个铣工、刨工学员，一到潍坊就被安排在招待所里，让他们自由活动。活动了九天，这里干部科的同志才向他们笑着说：“我们不需要刨工。”因此，他请三位刨工学员返回上海，等候重新分配（据说这也是根据四局的命令）。为了很好地欢送这三位旅行家，他们除照规定给三十元路费外（包括已买车票），又额外花去三十元左右给三人买了卧铺票。三个学员，无可奈何地走上归途，心里难过地说：“国家花掉这么多路费，难道就为着让我们看一看泰山吗？”他们回到技工训练班后，工作很久没有着落，有一个学员焦急地说：“新中动力机厂缺刨工不派，偏偏到山东去。现在好，成天看书、睡觉，四局连问也不问了。”
    读者大概还记得那千里迢迢打电话来的南昌柴油机厂吧，学员们到了这里以后的情况又是怎样呢？陪送人员一到这个厂，厂里人事科同志就跳了起来说：“怎么？还是送来啦。”
      “是呀，这是四局的命令呀！”陪送人员拿出四局公文，对方只好摇摇头叹了口气。
    怎么办呢？人来了总得想法子啊！厂领导仔细研究后，觉得车间不缺铣工、刨工，暂时缺的倒是车工，看样子得把铣工、刨工改成车工或者磨工。我写到这里，不用学员们说话，亲爱的读者，你也会大声地喊道：“这是怎么一回事呀？上海车工改铣工，车工改刨工，南昌铣工、刨工反过来要改车工或磨工，事先调换一下，不就好了吗？”可惜四局负责分配工作的同志事先并不好好调查，他们只会坐在办公室里闭门编制分配毕业学员的表格，当然只能做出这样糊涂事来罗！
