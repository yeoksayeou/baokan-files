New Achievements in China's Shipbuilding Industry

    China's first self-made coastal passenger and cargo ship, the "Democracy No. 10," has set sail.
    This coastal passenger and cargo ship, designed and manufactured by China itself, has modern construction and navigation equipment, and electrical controls are used in some places. Its birth marks a new achievement in China's shipbuilding industry.
    This group of photos was taken by Bi Pinfu of the Liberation Daily and Qian Houxiang of the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio.

    我国造船工业的新成就
    我国第一艘自制的沿海客货轮——“民主十号”已经开航。
    这艘我国自己设计和制造的沿海客货轮的构造和航行设备都是近代化的，有的地方还使用了电气操纵。它的诞生标志着我国造船工业的新成就。
