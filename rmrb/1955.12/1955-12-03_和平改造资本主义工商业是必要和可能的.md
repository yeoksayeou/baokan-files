Further Improve the Work of Transforming Capitalist Industry and Commerce
Peaceful Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce is Necessary and Possible
Liu Huinong, Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC

I.

In the past few years, according to the Party's general line, the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and the Party Central Committee's policy of peaceful transition, we have achieved great success in our practical work. It is entirely certain that the Party Central Committee's line of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is correct. Peaceful transition is necessary and possible.

In Wuhan, among private industrial factories with more than ten people, the situation of joint state-private ownership is as follows: output value accounts for 61% of the total, workers account for 58% of the total, the number of households accounts for 8% of the total, and assets account for 90% of the total. Processing and ordering rose to 81% in the first half of 1955.

The 1,700 large private wholesalers have been replaced by state-owned commercial enterprises. Major agricultural and industrial products have been controlled by state-owned commercial enterprises. Among the 43 industries managed by the Commercial Bureau, 21 major industries have developed into various forms of state capitalism. Among the city's more than 9,000 retail merchants, 3 are under joint state-private ownership, and more than 6,000 are engaged in distribution and sales on commission; among the more than 6,000 husband-and-wife stores, one-quarter have become state-owned commercial distribution and sales stores; the vast majority of the remainder also rely on state-owned commercial enterprises for supplies and are subject to varying degrees of planned control by state-owned commercial enterprises.

II.

Joint state-private ownership is a powerful weapon for transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and our practical work has indeed proved this.

Now, let's take the case of the joint state-private ownership of the Minsheng Shipping Company as an example to briefly illustrate this:

The Minsheng Shipping Company originally had 43,000 tons of shipping capacity and more than 8,000 employees. However, due to capitalist management, the internal political situation was complex, the organizational structure was huge, personnel were redundant, the system was chaotic, and technology was conservative and backward. In the eighteen months after liberation, statistics showed a loss of more than 13 million yuan and debts of more than 8 million yuan. Although the government provided support many times, it was still on the verge of collapse, people were panicked, employees were dissatisfied, and capitalists had no confidence and could not find a way out. Therefore, it was decided to implement joint state-private ownership in September 1952.

The majority of employees and representatives of the capitalists supported joint state-private ownership. However, they were afraid of layoffs, salary reductions, and unemployment. Therefore, in accordance with the central policy, we first adopted the approach of "taking them all in" and being responsible for arranging work, study, and life, which stabilized everyone's emotions.

After the joint venture, adjustments were gradually made according to the needs of production. Personnel with technology, ability, and representativeness were all assigned appropriate jobs, and other personnel were also handled appropriately. The excessively high wages of the original employees were temporarily retained and gradually resolved. In this way, the reform of the enterprise could be carried out smoothly. The enthusiasm of the workers was generally improved, the management was improved, and the superiority of the joint venture was increasingly revealed. Looking at the situation in the three years since the joint venture: the transportation volume in 1955 increased eightfold compared with 1952, and a total of 7.56 million tons of national transportation tasks were completed in the past three years. 31.4 million yuan was invested in capital construction, and a total of 79 new and renovated ships and barges were built, with a deadweight of 39,000 tons, increasing the number of ships by nearly double the original amount; labor productivity in 1955 increased by 146% compared with 1952; transportation costs decreased by 60% compared with 1952; safe production was implemented, and the serious accident situation before the joint venture was eliminated; not only was there no loss, but there were also surpluses every year. By 1954, a total of more than 30 million yuan of funds had been accumulated for the state, 3.32 million yuan was used for employee welfare, and 550,000 yuan of profits were paid to capitalists.

Our specific approach is to carry out work step by step and with a focus. Roughly divided into three steps: The first step, from September 1952 to April 1953, focused on relying on the working class, establishing the leading advantage of the working class, mobilizing the masses, implementing democratic management of the enterprise, criticizing capitalist management ideas, striving for a balance of payments, saving the enterprise from crisis, undertaking the transportation tasks assigned by the state, and striving to gradually incorporate them into the national plan. During this period, reforms were carried out in organizational leadership and management systems, basically overcoming the capitalist management style and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of employees; the second step, from April 1953 to April 1954, focused on further carrying out political work and enterprise reform. Grasp political work and the establishment of planned management work. During this period, education on labor discipline, planned management, and the general line was carried out to establish the leading ideology of socialism; the third step, from May 1954 to the present, focuses on managing ships well, promoting planned management, economic accounting, and wage reform. Up to now, on the basis of the greatly improved socialist consciousness of the broad masses of employees, planned management has been fully launched, and a labor competition to increase production and practice economy is being carried out with the ship voyage plan as the center.

We have gained the following main experiences:

1. Enterprise management must adopt socialist management methods. Promote advanced experience, criticize the erroneous ideas of the bourgeoisie that are conservative, backward, profit-seeking, disregarding the overall interests of the country, and not conducting economic accounting, and establish a socialist management system.

2. The transformation of bourgeois elements involves both uniting them and conducting necessary criticism. On matters of principle, we do not compromise, while appropriately taking care of their living problems, in order to achieve the goal of transformation through education and use. In the early stages of joint state-private ownership, capitalists did not believe in the superiority of socialism. For example, they said: "When your government cadres come, you can borrow money." We said: "We are not here to borrow money, but to improve the enterprise and accumulate funds for national construction." They also said: "You have ways to deal with the flood season, but you will have no ways to deal with the dry season." We said: "Mobilize the masses and create night navigation on the Sichuan River." When building new ships, they also said that building passenger ships was not right and that passenger-cargo ships should be built (such as the "Minzhong" ship). We said: "Division of labor between passengers and cargo is an advanced Soviet experience." As a result, it has been proven in practical actions that we are right, which has educated them in their practical work. Use facts to prove that socialism is better than capitalism.

3. Because we have made appropriate arrangements for and boldly used the main figures in the bourgeoisie, fully exerting their enthusiasm, they have been using their actual experience to promote the benefits of joint state-private ownership everywhere, which has had a very good effect, causing many people in the Minsheng Company who originally wanted to leave to stay.

4. We must rely on the leadership of the Party committee and the unity of thought within the Party. The transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is complex, and only when the Party's ideological understanding is consistent can we more effectively transform enterprises and capitalists. In the process of joint ventures, there is also struggle in the Party's thinking. For example, some people initially said: "Joint state-private ownership has no standpoint and represents the capitalists." We said: "We do not represent the capitalists, but the interests of the working class. Carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is part of the general line. As long as we act in accordance with the central principles and policies, we have a standpoint." The unity of ideological understanding within the Party is the decisive key to all problems. Only by relying on the leadership of the Party and the united strength of the working class can we do our work well.

III.

The so-called peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is a special form of class struggle, the purpose of which is to gradually transform the capitalist ownership into public ownership through various forms of state capitalism. This not only does not violate Marxism-Leninism in the slightest, but is precisely Comrade Mao Zedong's creative thinking in the field of Marxism-Leninism, making Marxism-Leninism richer, more forward-looking, and more realistic. However, our understanding is not always so profound and thorough. Therefore, we have shortcomings, problems, and limitations in our work.

Some of our staff members have deviations in their approach to the transformation of private industry and commerce in individual cases. The forms of expression are: one is simple control; the other is laissez-faire. This problem exists in both industry and commerce. A local state-owned machine factory often fails to complete its tasks, working overtime and hiring temporary workers. However, it refuses to delegate some of its tasks to private machine factories. A local state-owned chemical factory over-purchases 60% more tannin raw materials than planned and stores them in the warehouse, while a private soap factory lacks raw materials but is not given a solution. Wuhan's private rice processing plants are already in surplus, but we have built an automated rice processing plant, which will cause 30 medium-sized processing plants to collapse, and we still have to arrange for them today. Similar situations have also occurred in commerce. In the first half of this year, in accordance with the principle of "overall planning and comprehensive arrangements," household arrangements were made for private merchants, and the business volume of private merchants increased to some extent. However, because it remained in the form of distribution and sales on commission, the ratio of public to private ownership was not easy to grasp, and it fluctuated like a seesaw, unable to fully utilize all manpower and material resources, which affected the expansion of commodity circulation.

There are many reasons for these problems. The situation is also very complex. If we examine it ideologically, it is that many cadres lack sufficient understanding and importance of the central government's policy of peaceful transformation. Some cadres simply believe that: I am socialist, you are capitalist, you are you, I am me. They have not deeply realized that capitalist industry and commerce must be transformed into socialism, and bourgeois elements must be transformed into self-reliant laborers.

Peaceful transformation is possible. However, it requires repeated, meticulous, and complex work. Some of our comrades do not realize this. They are just afraid of trouble and like to do things simply, so they are prone to problems.

IV.

Our preliminary plan for the transformation of private industry and commerce in Wuhan in the future is:

1. There are currently 480 capitalist industrial enterprises with more than ten people; there are 18,000 employees (16,500 workers and 1,500 capitalists). We plan to adopt the method of joint state-private ownership in the entire industry and complete all joint ventures in 1956 and 1957. And we plan to establish nine professional companies, such as textiles, food, chemicals, machinery, and hardware.

2. In terms of commerce: in 1955, the silk cloth, new medicine, and Xiang embroidery industries will implement joint state-private ownership in the entire industry; 22 industries such as culture and education, porcelain, etc., will be jointly operated in batches in 1956 and 1957. In this way, more than 80% of commercial households will have carried out joint state-private ownership.

The characteristics of this plan are that there are many households, many employees, small output value, few assets, short time, large workload, and a need for many cadres, but we still lack experience in this work.

We are very confident in completing this plan. In addition to seizing the favorable conditions for the transformation of private industry and commerce, we are also prepared to overcome the difficulties that may be encountered in the transformation process. First of all, it is to plan comprehensively and strengthen leadership. We have had shortcomings in this regard in the past. In order to better implement the central government's instructions and solve many problems in our work, we are preparing to establish a unified leading agency for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Secondly, it is the consistency of cadres' ideological understanding, which requires a lot of work. It is very important to fully recognize the correctness of the peaceful transformation method adopted by the Party Central Committee. We have had some insufficient understanding in this area in the past. In the future, ideological understanding must be consistent from top to bottom, at all levels of leadership, and for all cadres. This requires repeatedly conducting ideological education work for cadres. Furthermore, in the process of carrying out socialist transformation, we will encounter many new problems in the future. We must recognize that, in addition to a few people in the bourgeoisie who will resist and sabotage, the majority of them can be educated and transformed.

We already have the conditions, the strength, the determination, and the confidence to carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. As long as we unify our understanding and work hard in accordance with the central principles and policies, we can complete the arduous task of carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

    进一步做好改造资本主义工商业的工作
    和平改造资本主义工商业是必要和可能的
    中共武汉市委副书记  刘惠农
    一
    几年来根据党的总路线，根据党对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造的政策，根据党中央和平过渡的方针，我们在实际工作中已经取得了很大的成绩。完全可以肯定：党中央对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的路线是正确的。和平过渡是必要的和可能的。
    武汉市私营工业十人以上的工厂，已经公私合营的情况是：产值占总数的百分之六十一，工人占总数的百分之五十八，户数占总数的百分之八，资产占总数的百分之九十。加工订货到一九五五年上半年则上升为百分之八十一。
    私营商业的一千七百家大批发商，已经被国营商业所代替。主要农产品和工业品已经为国营商业所掌握。归口到商业局管理的四十三个行业，已经有二十一个主要行业，发展为各种形式的国家资本主义。全市零售商九千多户中，公私合营的有三户，经销、代销的有六千多户；夫妻店六千多户中，已经有四分之一变为国营商业的经销、代销店；其余也绝大部分依靠国营商业进货，受着国营商业不同程度的计划控制。
    二
    公私合营，是改造资本主义工商业的有力武器，我们实际工作中确实证明了这一点。
    现在根据民生轮船公司公私合营的情况为例来简单说明一下：
    民生轮船公司原有四万三千吨运输量的船舶，职工八千多人，但是由于是资本主义经营管理，内部政治情况复杂，组织机构庞大，人事冗肿，制度混乱，技术保守落后，解放后十八个月统计亏一千三百多万元，债务达八百多万元。虽然政府多次扶持，仍有奄奄一息之势，人心惶惶不安，职工不满，资本家没有信心，找不到出路，于是在一九五二年九月决定实行公私合营。
    广大职工及资方代理人等对公私合营是拥护的。但是怕裁员减薪、怕失业，因此我们按中央政策，首先对他们采取包下来，负责安排工作、学习、生活，这样就安定了大家的情绪。
    合营后，根据生产上的需要，逐步进行调整，对有技术、有能力、有代表性的人员，一律安置适当工作，其他人员也分别作适当处理，对原有职工过高工资，暂作保留，逐步解决。这样就能够顺利地进行了企业内部的改革。工人积极性普遍提高，经营管理有了改善，合营的优越性日益显露，从合营后三年多来的情况看：运输量一九五五年比一九五二年增加了八倍，三年来共完成国家运输任务七百五十六万吨。投入基本建设资金三千一百四十万元，新造和改造船驳共七十九只，载重三万九千吨，船舶吨数增加将近原来的一倍；劳动生产率一九五五年比一九五二年提高了百分之一百四十六；运输成本比一九五二年降低百分之六十；实行了安全生产，合营前事故严重的恶劣情况消除了；不但不亏本，还年年有盈余。到一九五四年为止，共为国家积累资金三千多万元，用于职工福利三百三十二万元，付给资本家利润五十五万元。
    我们的具体做法是有步骤有中心地进行工作。大体上分为三步：第一步从一九五二年九月到一九五三年四月，是以依靠工人阶级，树立工人阶级领导优势，发动群众，实行企业民主管理，批判资本主义经营思想，争取收支平衡，挽救企业危机，担负国家分配的运输任务，争取逐步纳入国家计划为中心。这一时期进行了组织领导和管理制度的改革，基本上克服了资本主义经营管理作风，发挥了职工的积极性和创造性；第二步从一九五三年四月到一九五四年四月，是以进一步进行政治工作和企业改革为中心。抓住政治工作和建立计划管理工作。这一时期进行了劳动纪律、计划管理和总路线的教育，以树立社会主义的领导思想；第三步从一九五四年五月到现在，是以管好船舶，推行计划管理，经济核算和工资改革为中心。到目前止，在广大职工群众社会主义觉悟大大提高的基础上，计划管理已经全面展开了，正在以船舶航次计划为中心开展增产节约的劳动竞赛。
    我们取得了以下几条主要经验：
    一、企业管理，必须采用社会主义的经营管理方法。推广先进经验，批判资产阶级保守落后、唯利是图、不顾国家整体利益，不进行经济核算的错误思想，建立社会主义的经营管理制度。
    二、对资产阶级分子的改造，一方面是团结他们，一方面是进行必要的批评，在原则问题上不迁就，同时适当照顾他们的生活问题，从教育和使用中达到改造目的。公私合营初期，资本家不相信社会主义的优越，如说：你们政府干部来了，可以借款。我们说：不是来借款，而是来搞好企业，积累资金为给国家搞建设。又如说：洪水季节你们有办法，枯水季节就会没有办法，我们说：发动群众，创造川江夜行。在建造新轮船的时候他们又说造客船不对，应该造客货兼用船（如造民众轮）。我们说：客货分工，这是苏联先进经验。结果在实际行动中都证明我们是对的，这就使他们在实际工作中受到教育。用事实证明社会主义比资本主义好。
    三、由于我们对资产阶级中的主要人物进行了适当安排和大胆使用，充分发挥了他们的积极性，因而他们到处用实际体会去宣传公私合营的好处，效果很好，使民生公司中许多原来想离开的人，也不走了。
    四、必须依靠党委的领导和党内思想的一致。对资本主义工商业的改造工作是复杂的，要党内思想认识一致，才能更有力地改造企业和资本家。在合营过程中，党内思想也是有斗争的。例如开始有人说：公私合营是没有立场、代表资本家。我们说：不是代表资本家，而是代表工人阶级利益，对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造是总路线的一部分，只要按中央方针政策办事，就有立场。党内思想认识统一是一切问题的决定关键，只有依靠党的领导，依靠工人阶级团结的力量，才能把工作做好。
    三
    所谓和平改造资本主义工商业，就是阶级斗争的一种特殊形式，其目的就是要把资本主义的所有制，经过国家资本主义的各种形式，逐步改变为全民所有制。这不仅丝毫没有违反马克思、列宁主义，而正是毛泽东同志在马克思、列宁主义领域内富有创造性的思想，使马克思、列宁主义更丰富、更向前发展、更有现实意义。但是我们的认识并不都是那样深刻，那样透彻的。因而，我们在工作中是有缺点、有毛病、有局限性的。
    我们有些工作人员，在个别问题上，对私营工商业改造的工作做法是有偏差的。表现形式是：一种是简单控制；一种是放任自流。工业上、商业上这个问题都存在。有一家地方国营机器厂，任务经常做不完，加班加点，雇临时工，要他分点任务给私营机器厂，却不肯给。有一家地方国营化工厂，超计划多买百分之六十的皮油原料放在仓库里存起来，而私营肥皂厂原料不足，却不给解决。武汉市私营加工米厂，本来就过剩，我们又建立了个自动化加工米厂，使得三十家中型加工米厂将要垮台，我们今天还得安排。商业上也发生过类似的情况。今年上半年根据“统筹兼顾，全面安排”的原则，对私商进行了分户安排，私商营业额有所上升，但是由于停留在经销、代销的形式上，公私比重不易掌握，跳板式地一时上，一时下，不能把所有人力物力充分利用起来，影响了商品流转的扩展。
    产生这些毛病的原因很多。情况也很复杂。如果从思想上检查，那就是有不少的干部对中央和平改造的方针，缺乏足够的认识和重视。有的干部简单地认为：我是社会主义，你是资本主义，你是你，我是我。没有深刻认识到，要把资本主义变为社会主义，要把资产阶级分子改造为自食其力的劳动者。
    和平改造是有可能的。但是要经过反复的、细致的、复杂的工作。我们有的同志认识不到这一点。就是怕麻烦，喜欢简单从事，所以容易出毛病。
    四
    今后我们对武汉市私营工商业的改造初步规划是：
    一、现有十人以上资本主义工业有四百八十户；从业人员有一万八千人，（职工一万六千五百人，资本家一千五百人）。我们准备采取全行业公私合营的办法，在一九五六、一九五七两年内全部合营完毕。并且准备成立纺织、食品、化工、机器、五金等九个专业公司。
    二、商业方面：一九五五年实行全行业公私合营的有绸布、新药、湘绣三个行业；文教、瓷器等二十二个行业，将分批地在一九五六及一九五七年合营完毕。这样就有百分之八十以上的商业户进行了公私合营。
    这个规划的特点是户数多、从业人员多、产值小、资产少、时间短、工作量大、需要干部多，而我们在这项工作上还缺乏经验。
    我们很有信心完成这一计划。除了抓住对私营工商业改造的有利条件之外，我们也准备克服在改造过程中可能遇到的困难。首先，就是全面规划，加强领导。过去我们在这方面是有缺点的。为了更好地贯彻执行中央的指示，解决许多工作中的问题，我们准备成立对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的统一领导机构。其次，就是干部思想认识上的一致，这需要做很多工作，很重要的是要充分认识党中央采取和平改造办法的正确性。过去我们在这一方面是有些认识不够的。今后必须从上到下，各级领导，各级干部思想认识一致。这就需要反覆地对干部进行思想教育工作。再其次，在进行社会主义改造的过程中，今后还会碰到很多新的问题。必须认识，资产阶级中除了少数人会抗拒、破坏以外，他们中的多数，是可以教育改造过来的。
    我们已经有条件，有力量，有决心，有信心对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造。只要我们统一认识，按中央政策方针去努力工作，就可以完成对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的艰巨任务。
