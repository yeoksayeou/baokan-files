    Soviet High-Speed Electronic Computer

    The Soviet Academy of Sciences has a high-speed electronic computer, which can be regarded as one of the most outstanding achievements of modern science and technology.
    Academician Lebedev, Director of the Institute of Precision Instruments and Computing Machinery of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, recently told a TASS reporter that this machine is a powerful tool for scientific research. With this machine, the mathematical operations of the most important problems in physics, mechanics, astronomy, and chemistry have been completely changed. This machine can perform an average of 8,000 calculations per second, equivalent to the labor of tens of thousands of people.
    The high-speed electronic computer includes a calculation device, a "recording" device, and a control part that ensures the complete automation of the calculation process.
    During calculation, a calculation outline is first compiled, stipulating a series of mathematical calculation actions. Then, this calculation outline and the necessary coefficients are translated into code numbers and punched onto a paper tape. The paper tape is placed in the machine. The user presses a switch, and the machine starts to operate. The problem to be solved becomes a current pulse that is transmitted from the paper tape to another part of the machine. Then the machine calculates by itself. The result of the calculation is obtained by a special device. Here, the current pulse corresponding to the new code is transformed into luminous numbers, and printed onto film through optical action. The film can print two hundred numbers per second. The machine is equipped with an electric printer to help obtain the data obtained during the calculation process.
    The high-speed electronic computer works day and night. It has five thousand electron tubes. Two engineers and one technician are responsible for technical management.
    The Soviet Academy of Sciences uses this high-speed electronic computer to solve a large number of problems in various scientific and technical fields. For example, it calculated the orbits of about seven hundred asteroids for the International Astronomical Calendar in a few days, taking into account the influence of Jupiter and Saturn. These calculations previously required a large computing organization to work for several months to complete.
    At the International Electronic Computer Conference held in Darmstadt not long ago, this Soviet computer was considered the fastest in Europe and on par with the most modern American computers.
    Academician Lebedev finally said that Soviet scientists are now working hard to further improve computing technology and create more efficient computing machines. (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, via TASS)

    苏联的快速电子计算机
    苏联科学院有一部快速电子计算机，这部机器可以算是现代科学技术思想的最卓越的成就之一。
    苏联科学院精密器械和计算机器研究所所长列别杰夫最近对塔斯社记者说，这种机器是科学研究工作的得力工具，有了这种机器，物理学、力学、天文学和化学中的最重要问题的数学运算就完全改观了。这种机器平均每秒钟可以做八千次演算动作，顶得过几万人的劳动。
    快速电子计算机包括计算装置、“记载”装置和保证计算过程完全自动化的操纵部分。
    在演算时，先要编制好一个演算大纲，规定好一系列的数学演算动作。而后把这个演算大纲和必须要的系数译成代号码子打在纸带上。把纸带放入机器里面。使用者按一下开关，机器就开始动作，算题变成电流脉冲由纸带传往机器的另一部分。而后机器就自己计算起来。计算的结果是靠一种特殊的装置而得到的。在这里，同新的代号相应的电流脉冲变为发光的数目字，并且经过光学作用而印在胶片上。胶片上每秒钟可以印二百个数字。机器装备有电机印字设备，帮助获得在计算过程中所得出的数据。
    快速电子计算机日夜工作。它有五千个电子管。两个工程师和一个技师担任技术管理。
    苏联科学院利用这部快速电子计算机解答了各种科学和技术部门的大量算题。例如，在几天当中为国际天文学日历计算了约七百个小行星的轨道，在计算中还考虑到木星和土星的影响。这些计算工作以前需要一个很大的计算机构工作好几个月才能完成。
    在不久以前在达姆斯塔德所举行的国际电子计算机会议上，这部苏联计算机被认为是欧洲速度最快的，同最新式的美国计算机水平相等。
    列别杰夫院士最后说，现在苏联科学家正在努力进一步改进计算技术，创造效率更高的计算机器。　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯）
