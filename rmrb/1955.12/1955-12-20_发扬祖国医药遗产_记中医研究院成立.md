    Carry Forward the Legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    ——On the Establishment of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    By Our Correspondent Jian Yuan
    A new building has been completed inside Guang'anmen in Beijing, at Beixiange. This is the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. It was officially inaugurated on December 19th.
    For thousands of years, traditional Chinese medicine, passed down through generations and continuously developed and enriched, has safeguarded the health and prosperity of the Chinese people. Today, the task of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is to inherit and promote this cultural heritage, diligently study and research its theories and practical experience, and use scientific methods to organize and summarize it, gradually improving its academic and medical levels, so that it can serve the people more effectively.
    The Internal Medicine Institute of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on the original outpatient department of the Preparatory Office of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In the past year, the outpatient department has provided treatment for 99,700 visits. The diseases treated mainly included six types such as neurasthenia and arthritis. According to statistics from the second and third quarters of this year, a total of over 35,600 visits were made for various diseases, with an overall treatment effectiveness of approximately 70%. They also participated in consultation work at various hospitals in Beijing and studied and promoted the treatment of epidemic Japanese encephalitis. Currently, eight research groups focusing on liver and kidney diseases, asthma, rheumatic diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, abdominal distension, menstrual disorders, hypertension, and infectious diseases serve as components of the Internal Medicine Institute. This is the initial plan. In the past, some people believed that "Traditional Chinese medicine cannot treat infectious diseases," but this statement has now been refuted by facts. The establishment of the Internal Medicine Institute will further overcome similar claims.
    The Surgery Institute of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is established based on the Chongqing hemorrhoid and fistula team that is currently disseminating its experience in Beijing. The dry hemorrhoid method and thread-hanging method are among the many methods of traditional Chinese medicine for treating hemorrhoids and fistulas. These methods are simple, economical, and have a thorough therapeutic effect. Their indications are often contraindications for Western surgical treatment. They have long enjoyed a high reputation among the broad masses of working people. In half a year, the Chongqing hemorrhoid and fistula medical team treated more than two-thirds of the 1,400-plus patients who registered for treatment. Their work has been welcomed and valued by people at home and abroad. The initial plan for the Surgery Institute includes setting up research groups for hemorrhoids and fistulas, as well as sexually transmitted diseases, bone tuberculosis and lymph node tuberculosis, female pelvic diseases, tumor diseases, ophthalmology, traumatology, and other research groups.
    The Acupuncture Institute of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine has a particularly good foundation. It is composed of the Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute, originally under the Central Ministry of Health. Over the past four years, it has made remarkable achievements in research, treatment, and cadre training. They have completed clinical treatment research on eight diseases such as malaria and hypertension. They also focus on observing the effect of acupuncture on human gastric motility for clinical physiological research. Treatment work is mainly carried out through outpatient services. Over the past four years, the outpatient department has received more than 162,400 visits. According to statistics on 1,466 patients this year, the effective rate reached 85%. They have organized acupuncture medical research teams many times to go to ethnic minority areas, industrial and mining areas, and rural areas to treat the masses. The Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute has organized and assisted in running a total of 23 acupuncture training courses in various places to train acupuncture cadres, with 1,236 students. They have established contact with more than 660 units across the country, and have also established contact with eight countries including the Soviet Union. These activities have created favorable conditions for future research work. The initial plan for the Acupuncture Institute is to establish research groups (laboratories) for circulation, movement, digestion, respiration, nerves, pediatrics, gynecology, manipulation and tools, schistosomiasis and clinical treatment, and basic medicine.
    Another component of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica. Traditional Chinese medicine has a glorious history of more than 4,000 years, which is more than a century earlier than the earliest use of medicinal herbs for treatment by the ancient Babylonians (2550 BC). China's earliest materia medica book, "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic," recorded 365 kinds of traditional Chinese medicines. Subsequently, there have been continuous additions throughout the dynasties, and now there are no less than 2,000 kinds, and the output is also extremely abundant. The Institute of Chinese Materia Medica will focus on the characteristics of the wide variety of traditional Chinese medicines, gradually organize them, and conduct research on pharmacognosy to identify the authenticity and quality of traditional Chinese medicines and give full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicines. The Institute of Chinese Materia Medica is based on the original Chinese Pharmaceutical Research Institute of the Central Institute of Health. They have now collected more than 1,500 kinds of Chinese medicines, totaling 2,500 pieces. The Institute of Chinese Materia Medica has established research laboratories for pharmacognosy, pharmacology, chemical analysis, Chinese medicinal plant cultivation, and dosage form improvement. The path taken by the great pharmacologist Li Shizhen more than 300 years ago inspires the researchers of Chinese materia medica.
    The affiliated hospital of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is located on the banks of the beautiful Wanshou Mountain in the western suburbs of Beijing. It has departments of internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, acupuncture, stomatology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and radiology. It has temporarily set up 100 beds and can serve 200 outpatient visits. The hospital beds of the affiliated hospital will mainly serve patients who need to undergo clinical observation and cooperate with teaching for the various research institutes. In order to cultivate research talents, the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine has specially established a Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class. The first term has already started. The teachers are more than 30 well-known traditional Chinese medicine practitioners from all over the country. They teach and conduct research at the same time. There are more than 100 students, who are Western medicine doctors with clinical experience and newly graduated students from higher medical colleges from all over the country. In addition, the medical history office of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine will undertake the task of organizing and researching the history of traditional Chinese medicine. In order to strengthen leadership, research committees have also been established in the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine and its various research institutes, and scholars of traditional Chinese and Western medicine from all over the country have been invited to serve as committee members, with the aim of collecting ideas and benefiting from collective wisdom.
    Premier Zhou Enlai specially wrote an inscription for the establishment of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine: "Carry forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and serve socialist construction." A great cause has begun. All the staff of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine have taken the glorious first step with confidence.

    发扬祖国医药遗产
    ——记中医研究院成立
    本报记者　鉴远
    一片新楼房在北京广安门里，北线阁落成了。这里就是中医研究院。十二月十九日，它宣告正式成立了。
    几千年来，世代相传并不断地发展丰富起来的中医学术，它保障了我国人民的健康和繁荣。今天，继承和发扬这份文化遗产，认真学习和研究它的学理和实践经验，用科学方法加以整理和总结，逐步提高它的学术水平和医疗水平，使它更有效地为人民服务，就是中医研究院的任务。
    中医研究院设立的内科研究所。是以原中医研究院筹备处门诊部为基础组成。一年以来，门诊部接受了九万九千七百多人次的治疗。曾经治疗的疾病主要是神经衰弱、关节炎等六种。根据今年第二、第三季度的统计，各种疾病共门诊三万五千六百多人次，总的治疗效果约为百分之七十。他们还参加了北京市各医院的会诊工作，并学习和推广了流行性乙型脑炎的治疗。现在，肝肾病、喘息病、风湿病、胃肠病、臌胀病、经带病、高血压病和传染病八个研究组，作为内科研究所的组成部分。这是初期规划。过去有人认为“中医不能治疗传染病”，现在这种说法已被事实击破。内科研究所的建立，将进一步战胜类似这样的说法。
    中医研究院的外科研究所是以正在北京传播经验的重庆痔瘘小组为基础建立的。枯痔法和挂线法是中医治疗痔瘘的许多方法之一，这种方法简便、经济，治疗效果彻底。它的适应症往往是西医手术治疗的禁忌症。它在广大劳动人民中早已有着很高的信誉。重庆痔瘘医疗小组，半年中挂号求诊的一千四百多患者，三分之二以上已经他们治愈。他们的工作受到了国内外人士的欢迎和重视。外科研究所初期规划，除了设立痔瘘病研究组以外，还设立性病、骨结核淋巴结核病、妇女盆腔病、肿瘤病、眼科病、伤科病等研究组。
    中医研究院的针灸研究所有着特别好的基础。它是由原属中央卫生部的针灸疗法实验所组成的。四年多来，它在研究、治疗和培养干部工作方面，都有了显著成绩。他们完成了疟疾、高血压等八种病的临床治疗研究。他们还以针灸对人体胃蠕动的影响的观察为重点，进行临床生理研究。治疗工作以门诊为主，四年多来，门诊共接受十六万二千四百多人次。据今年对一千四百六十六名病人的统计，有效率达百分之八十五。他们曾经多次组织针灸医疗研究组织，到少数民族地区、工矿区和农村，为群众治病。针灸疗法实验所为培养针灸干部先后在各地主办和协助办的针灸班共计二十三班，学员一千二百三十六人。他们和全国各地建立了联系的单位已经有六百六十多个，国外还同苏联等八个国家有了联系。这些活动为今后的研究工作创造了有利条件。针灸研究所初期规划设立循环、运动、消化、呼吸、神经、小儿、妇女、手法及工具、血吸虫病及临床治疗、基础医学等研究组（室）。
    中医研究院的另一组成部分是中药研究所。中药已经有四千多年的光辉历史，比古代巴比伦人最先采用药草治病的时间（公元前二五五○年），还早一世纪多。在我国最早的药书“神农本草经”里就收载了中药三百六十五种，以后历代累有增加，到现在不下两千多种，产量也极为丰富。中药研究所将针对中药品种繁多的特点，逐步加以整理，进行生药学的研究，以鉴别中药真伪好坏，发挥中药作用。中药研究所是以中央卫生研究院的原中国医药研究所为基础组成的。现在他们已经搜集了一千五百多种中药，共计二千五百件。中药研究所设立生药、药理、化学分析、中药栽培、剂型改良等研究室。三百多年前的伟大药学家李时珍走过的道路，鼓舞着中药研究工作者们。
    中医研究院的附属医院在美丽的北京西郊万寿山畔。它设有内、外、妇、小儿、针灸、口腔、眼耳鼻喉、放射线等科，暂设床位一百张，门诊二百人次。附属医院的病床，主要将为各研究所需要进行临床观察的患者和配合教学服务。为了培养研究人材，中医研究院特建立了中医研究班。第一期已经开课。教师是来自全国的三十多位著名中医，他们一面教学，一面进行研究；学员有一百多名，他们是来自全国各地医院的具有临床经验的西医师和新毕业的高等医学院校的学生。另外，中医研究院院部的医史室，将担负起整理和研究中医史的任务。为了加强领导，在中医研究院院部和各研究所，还建立了研究委员会，聘请全国中西医学者担任委员，借收集思广益的效果。
    周恩来总理特为中医研究院的成立题辞：“发扬祖国医药遗产，为社会主义建设服务。”伟大的事业开始了。中医研究院全体工作人员满怀信心地迈开了光荣的第一步。
