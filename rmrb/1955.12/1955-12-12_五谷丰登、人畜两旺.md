    Editor's Note: The Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative is a very well-run cooperative. When this cooperative was first established, the vast majority of its members were poor peasants, and they faced many difficulties in production. However, three years later, the yield per unit area of this cooperative increased by 67.3% compared to before the establishment of the cooperative, with an average yield of 450 jin per mu. This year's total grain output averages 1,050 jin per person in the whole cooperative; in addition, the cooperative has sideline income of more than 4,000 yuan. The cooperative has accumulated public property of about 8,000 yuan and has repaid the state loan and the price of the draft cattle and farm implements contributed by the members. According to the cooperative's five-year plan targets, by 1960, the cooperative's total production income will be four times that of 1955. This cooperative has good experience in developing production, the plan is realistic, and it has grasped the key to increasing production, which can be used as a reference for agricultural production cooperatives in various regions.

    The Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Third District of Qufu County, Shandong Province, was established in the autumn of 1952. Initially, there were 21 households (18 poor peasant households and 3 middle peasant households). In 1953, there were 23 households, in 1954, there were 24 households, and this spring it developed to 63 households with 347 people. The number of households joining the cooperative accounts for 93% of the total number of households in the village (there are 68 households in the village, and there are still 3 landlord households, 1 rich peasant household, and 1 well-to-do middle peasant household that have not joined the cooperative). The village has a total of 819 mu of cultivated land (including 78.9 mu of river sandy land), and the soil is mostly fine sandy loam.

    Over the past three years since the establishment of this cooperative, agricultural production has greatly developed. The yield per unit area was 269 jin during the mutual aid group period in 1952, and it increased to 450 jin in 1955, an increase of 67.3%. This year's total grain output is 364,455 jin, averaging 1,050 jin per person in the whole cooperative. The actual income of all cooperative members has greatly increased compared to when they were in mutual aid groups or working individually. In the past, 15 households needed government relief for many years, but now they no longer need relief; 35 grain-deficient households are now not only not short of grain, but some households have also sold surplus grain. This year, the cooperative sold 49,700 jin of surplus grain to the state. The cooperative can adjust the grain surplus and deficit of its members internally, and it no longer needs to be supplied by the state. The members say that the superiority of the cooperative is "four fears not": First, no fear of land lacking fertilizer (at the beginning of the cooperative, only 6 pigs were raised, and 12,250 jin of soybean cake was used for planting wheat, and the land was still very lacking in fertilizer. Now the cooperative raises 139 pigs, accumulates a lot of fertilizer, saves soybean cake, and also guarantees increased production); second, no fear of drought (irrigated land accounts for more than 70%); third, no fear of weeds (deep plowing and careful cultivation, diligent weeding); fourth, no fear of insect pests (good prevention and control).

    With the needs of agricultural production development, animal husbandry and forestry production have also begun to develop. Because this village (cooperative) is located on the bank of the Alkali River, the land used to be eroded by rainwater and the crops were blown by wind and sand. After the establishment of the cooperative, the members felt that to increase production, they had to do a good job in water and soil conservation and wind and sand prevention. Therefore, they used the river beach (desert) on both sides of the Alkali River to vigorously plant trees and afforest. Today, the forests on both sides of the Alkali River in this village are endless and have begun to show a green scene. Large-scale afforestation not only maintains water and soil, protects the village, but also has more than 200 mu of sandy beach covered with large layers of drifting soil, which can be cultivated (peanuts have been planted this year). It is expected that in a few years, a large area of wasteland can be turned into fertile land. The development of forestry has also created conditions for the development of animal husbandry, and a large number of leaves and newly grown green grass on the beach can be used to feed livestock. This year, the cooperative raised a total of 139 pigs (79 publicly raised, 60 self-raised by members); there are also 9 sows, which gave birth to 9 litters of piglets this year, a total of more than 130 piglets. This year, a total of 170 fat pigs can be sold to the state. Originally there were 26 sheep, and this year it can be bred to 40 sheep. The initial development of animal husbandry and forestry has provided extremely favorable conditions for increasing agricultural production, such as maintaining water and soil, improving soil, expanding cultivated land area, and increasing farmland fertilizer. The members have begun to realize the importance of the coordinated development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. When people estimate the value of 70,000 trees on the river beach, the members' reply is: No amount of money can exchange for them.

    In addition, the cooperative also carried out five kinds of sideline production: one oil mill, mainly for processing for the state; one flour mill, mainly for raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer; and organized carpentry groups, masonry groups, and mat weaving groups. The development of sidelines has given play to the members' technical expertise, utilized surplus labor, solved the economic difficulties of the members, and increased the income of the cooperative. The net income of the five sidelines throughout the year is 4,001 yuan, which has accumulated production funds and promoted the development of agricultural production. In addition to repaying the state loan and the depreciated value of the members' draft animals and farm implements, the cooperative has also accumulated public property with a total value of about 8,000 yuan. The members reflected: The cooperative has various productions, distributes grain and money, and there is no difficulty in anything. Our cooperative, like a family living together, has really stood up straight.

    Due to the development of production and the improvement of living standards, the cultural and educational undertakings of this cooperative have also developed. They have established a farmers' spare-time school, divided into junior and senior classes, with two teachers and sixty students. They also subscribe to newspapers and periodicals such as "Agricultural Knowledge," "Dazhong Daily," and "Rural Dazhong"; and there is also a radio set, and the members often listen to broadcasts about agricultural production cooperatives. The cooperative has a health committee member and a health worker responsible for health work; and there are also two midwives who safely received thirty infants this year. The general reflection of the members is: Three years of running the cooperative have brought great changes. Production has developed, living standards have improved, more people are literate, and people are thriving. Some members said: These years have really been a time of bumper harvests and thriving livestock.

    Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" greatly encouraged the confidence of all members to move forward. "The road is right, well-taken, there is hope, there is a future, work hard to develop production, and build socialism" - this is the belief of the vast number of members.

    In order to develop production more systematically and comprehensively, and to build a fully socialist cooperative as soon as possible, after repeated research by the Party branch and the cooperative affairs committee and repeated discussions by all members, the cooperative formulated a production plan from 1955 to 1960. This plan is:

    Agricultural production: By 1960, the total grain output is required to increase from the current 364,455 jin to 584,766 jin, an increase of 60.44% compared to 1955. Average yield per mu of main grain crops: wheat 400 jin, an increase of 122.2% compared to the current yield; corn 630 jin, an increase of 110%; soybeans 330 jin, an increase of 83.4%; millet 620 jin, an increase of 87.9%; sorghum 570 jin, an increase of 135.5%. After the realization of this planning target, the average grain income per person in the whole cooperative can reach 1,685 jin.

    Animal husbandry production: By 1960, it is required to develop to raise 24 horses (currently 4), 27 cattle (currently 11), 26 donkeys (currently 9), 400 pigs, 500 sheep, 500 chickens, and also raise 2 dairy cows and 30 dairy goats; the total value is 13,550 yuan (excluding the production value of eggs, cow and goat milk, etc.).

    Forestry production: It is planned to afforest another 1,500 mu of wasteland, and the total number of trees planted including those planted before will be 93,210 trees. Including: 91,200 general trees, 1,410 peach trees, jujube trees, grape trees, and pear trees, and 600 mulberry trees. Total value is 239,250 yuan (excluding the value of fruit from fruit trees).

    Sideline production: In addition to continuing to operate the five sideline industries and increasing or decreasing them as needed and possible, it is also necessary to develop other sideline industries conditionally. Because there are a large number of fruit trees that can raise bees, it is required to increase the number of beehives from the original one to 40, reaching an annual honey collection of 1,200 jin. 600 mulberry trees can raise silkworms, and it is required to raise silkworms to 30 mats. In addition, it is necessary to build a lotus pond (an area of ​​two mu) and a fish pond by the river for planting lotus roots and fish production.

    After all the above plans are realized, the average income per household of cooperative members can be 9,268 jin of grain and 1,100 yuan of money. The average income per person can be 1,685 jin of grain and 200 yuan of money. The total income of the cooperative can be equivalent to four times that of 1955.

    With the development of production, the living standards of the members will also continue to improve. The plan requires further improvement of the existing farmers' spare-time school in the cooperative, requiring that within five years, young men and women reach the level of senior elementary school, and adults under the age of 40 should recognize more than 1,000 characters and be able to read the "Rural Dazhong" newspaper and popular reading materials. Establish a library and a club each. Establish a clinic and a busy-season nursery each.

    How does this cooperative ensure the thorough implementation of this plan?

    (1) Grasp the six key points for increasing production. 1. Increase the planting of high-yield crops, implement "two crops a year" and "intercropping". The area of ​​"two crops a year" is required to expand from the current 63% of the total sown area to 85% in 1956, and to reach all in 1957; at the same time, gradually expand the "intercropping" area. 2. Vigorously raise pigs to accumulate fertilizer. In addition to developing animal husbandry in the cooperative and raising a large number of pigs to accumulate fertilizer, it is also necessary to encourage members to raise pigs and accumulate fertilizer individually. 3. Develop farmland water conservancy. This year, the area of ​​irrigated land accounts for more than 70% of the total land area. In the future, 22 brick wells will be built, a reservoir will be built, two more waterwheels and a 5-horsepower water pump will be added, and all dry land will be turned into water land, and the afforestation plan will be guaranteed to maintain water and soil and achieve greening. 4. Use new farm implements and improve cultivation techniques. Starting in 1956, all land in the cooperative will be cultivated using double-share plows. This year, wheat has implemented wide-row close planting, and in 1956, other crops will also implement appropriate close planting. Popularize the introduction of improved varieties, and implement seed soaking, seed mixing, and pest control. 5. Improve the soil and expand the cultivated land area. Develop 300 mu of wasteland (150 mu has been opened), and turn sand and compress soil to convert it into fertile land, expanding the cultivated land area by 35%. Another 300 mu of cultivated land needs to be compressed with sand and soil replaced to improve the soil. 6. Train various technical personnel in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. In order to ensure that agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production can be well developed, it is planned to train one animal husbandry veterinarian and one forestry technician. Other technical personnel (such as pig raising, sheep raising, fruit tree pruning, etc.) also need to be trained as soon as possible.

    (2) Further strengthen the organization and leadership of the cooperative. Under the leadership of the Party branch, this cooperative should give full play to the role of the Party, the League organizations, and other organizations, continue to improve the work of the cooperative director and the cooperative affairs committee, and implement the leadership method of collective leadership, division of labor and responsibility, and democratic management. In order to meet the requirements of the new tasks, the cooperative affairs committee is prepared to absorb activists in the cooperative and form seven groups for agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, sideline industries, culture and education, health, finance and economics, and security, specifically responsible for the work in these seven aspects. Establish a responsibility system and various systems such as meetings, reports, summary evaluations, and rewards and punishments. The whole cooperative is divided into three production teams, implementing a contracting system for work and output. A supervisory committee has also been established to supervise the implementation of the plan and work by the groups, teams, and all members to ensure the successful completion of the planning tasks.

    五谷丰登、人畜两旺
    马英健
    编者按：陈家庄农业生产合作社是一个办得很好的合作社。这个社初建的时候，绝大部分社员都是贫农，生产上有很多困难。但是三年以后，这个社的单位面积产量比建社以前就提高了百分之六十七点三，每亩平均产量达四百五十斤。今年的粮食总产量全社每人平均可达一千零五十斤；另外，全社还有副业收入四千多元。社内已经积累了公共财产八千元左右，并且还清了国家贷款和社员耕牛、农具作价入社的价款。根据这个社的五年规划指标，到一九六零年，全社生产总收入将等于一九五五年的四倍。这个社发展生产的经验很好，规划也很切实，而且抓住了增产的关键，可供各地农业生产合作社参考。
    山东省曲阜县三区陈家庄农业生产合作社，是一九五二年秋季建立的。开始是二十一户（贫农十八户、中农三户），一九五三年是二十三户，一九五四年是二十四户，今年春天发展到六十三户，三百四十七人，入社户数占全村总户数的百分之九十三（全村六十八户，还有地主三户，富农一户，富裕中农一户没有入社）。全村共有耕地八百一十九亩（内有七十八亩九分是河沙地），土质大部是细砂壤土。
    这个社办社三年来，农业生产有了很大的发展。单位面积产量在一九五二年互助组的时候，是二百六十九斤，一九五五年提高到四百五十斤，增长了百分之六十七点三。今年粮食总产量是三十六万四千四百五十五斤，全社每人平均一千零五十斤。全体社员的实际收入都比在互助组或单干的时候大大增加。过去有十五户长年需要政府救济，现在已经不用救济；三十五户缺粮户，现在不仅都不缺粮，有些户还卖了余粮。全社今年卖给国家余粮四万九千七百斤。社员粮食余缺，社内可以调剂，不再要国家供应。社员说社的优越性是“四不怕”：一不怕地缺肥（前年初办社，只养六头猪，种麦用豆饼一万二千二百五十斤，地里肥料仍然很缺乏，现在社里养猪一百三十九头，积肥很多，省去了豆饼，还保证了增产）；二不怕天旱（水浇地占百分之七十以上）；三不怕地长草（深耕细作、勤锄）；四不怕虫害（防除得好）。
    随着农业生产发展的需要，畜牧、林业生产也开始发展起来了。这个村（社）因为处在碱河岸边，过去土地被雨水冲刷，庄稼被风砂吹打。办社以后，社员们感到要增加生产，就要做好水土保持和防治风砂的工作。因此，就利用碱河两岸的河滩（沙漠），大力植树造林。如今，这个村碱河两岸的林丛，一望无边，开始出现了绿化景象。大量造林不仅保持了水土，保护了村庄，而且有二百多亩沙滩挂上了大层游土，可以耕种了（今年已种花生）。预计再过几年，就可以有大片荒滩变为良田。林业的发展，又给发展畜牧业创造了条件，大量树叶和遍滩新生的青草可以用来喂牲畜。今年社内共养猪一百三十九头（公养七十九头，社员自养六十头）；另有母猪九头，今年生小猪九窝，共一百三十多头。今年一共可以卖给国家肥猪一百七十头。原来养羊二十六只，今年可繁殖到四十只。畜牧、林业的初步发展，已经使农业增产获得了极为有利的条件，如保持水土，改良土壤，扩大耕地面积，增加农田肥料等。社员们开始体会到农、林、牧配合发展的重要，当人们估计河滩七万棵树木的价值的时候，社员的答复是：管多少钱也不能换。
    此外，社内还进行了五种副业生产：油坊一处，主要是给国家加工；粉房一处，主要是为了养猪积肥；并且组织有木工组、泥工组、编席组。副业的开展发挥了社员的技术专长，运用了剩余劳动力，解决了社员的经济困难问题，增加了社的收入。五种副业，全年共计净收入是四千零一元，积累了生产资金，促进了农业生产的发展。社内除还清了国家贷款和社员耕畜、农具的折价款以外，还积累了公共财产总值八千元左右。社员反映：社里有各样生产，分粮又分钱，什么都不困难了。咱这个社，像一家过日子一样，真是直起腰杆来了。
    由于生产的发展，生活水平的提高，这个社的文化教育事业也有了发展。他们办了一处农民业余学校，分初、高级两班，有教员两名，学生六十名。他们还订阅“农业知识”、“大众日报”、“农村大众”等报刊；还有收音机一架，社员们经常收听有关农业生产合作社的广播。社内有卫生委员和一名卫生员，负责卫生工作；还有两名接生员，今年安全地接收了三十个婴儿。社员的普遍反映是：办社三年，大变了样，生产发展了，生活提高了，识字的多了，人也旺了。有的社员说：这几年真是五谷丰登，人畜两旺。
    毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，大大鼓舞了全体社员前进的信心。“路子走的对，走的好，有希望，有奔头，努力发展生产，建设社会主义”——这是广大社员的信念。
    为了更有计划地全面地发展生产，早日建成完全社会主义的合作社，经过党支部和社务委员会的反复研究和全体社员的多次讨论，这个社制定了从一九五五年到一九六零年的生产规划。这个规划是：
    农业生产：到一九六零年，粮食总产量要求从现在的三十六万四千四百五十五斤提高到五十八万四千七百六十六斤，比一九五五年增加百分之六十点四四。主要粮食作物每亩平均产量：小麦四百斤，比现在的产量提高百分之一百二十二点二；玉米六百三十斤，提高百分之一百一十；大豆三百三十斤，提高百分之八十三点四；谷子六百二十斤，提高百分之八十七点九；高粱五百七十斤，提高百分之一百三十五点五。这个规划指标实现以后，全社每人平均粮食收入可以达到一千六百八十五斤。
    畜牧生产：到一九六零年，要求发展到养马二十四匹（现有四匹），牛二十七头（现有十一头），驴二十六头（现有九头），猪四百头，羊五百只，鸡五百只，并且养乳牛二头，乳羊三十只；总价值为一万三千五百五十元（鸡蛋、牛、羊奶等生产价值不在内）。
    林业生产：计划在荒滩上再造林一千五百亩，连以前植的树总共植树九万三千二百一十棵。计：一般树九万一千二百棵，桃树、枣树、葡萄树、梨树共一千四百一十棵，桑树六百棵。总值二十三万九千二百五十元（果树产果的价值不在内）。
    副业生产：除继续经营五种副业并根据需要和可能加以增、减外，还要有条件地发展其他各种副业。因为有大量果树可以养蜂，要求养蜂由原有一窝增加到四十窝，达到全年收蜜一千二百斤。六百棵桑树可以养蚕，要求养蚕达到三十席。此外，要在河边建立藕塘一个（面积二亩），鱼池一个，进行植藕和养鱼生产。
    上述计划全部实现以后，全社社员平均每户可收入粮食九千二百六十八斤，钱一千一百元。平均每人可以收入粮食一千六百八十五斤，钱二百元。社内总收入可相当于一九五五年的四倍。
    随着生产的发展，社员的生活水平也将不断地提高。规划中要求进一步办好社内已有的一处农民业余学校，要求在五年以内，男女青年都达到高小程度，四十岁以下的壮年要认一千字以上，并且能够阅读“农村大众”报和通俗读物。建立图书馆、俱乐部各一处。成立诊疗所、农忙托儿所各一处。
    这个社怎样保证这一规划的彻底实现呢？
    （一）抓住六个增产关键。1、增种高产作物，实行“一年两作”和“间种”。“一年两作”的面积要求一九五六年由现在占总播种面积的百分之六十三扩大到百分之八十五，一九五七年达到全部；同时逐年扩大“间种”面积。2、大力养猪积肥。除社内发展牧畜并大量养猪积肥外，还要鼓励社员个人养猪积肥。3、开展农田水利。今年水浇地面积占土地总面积的百分之七十以上。今后再砌砖井二十二眼，修蓄水池一个，增加水车两部、五个马力的抽水机一架，把全部旱地变成水地，并且保证完成植树造林计划，以保持水土、实现绿化。4、使用新式农具，改良耕作技术。从一九五六年开始，全社土地全部使用双铧犁耕作。今年小麦已实行宽幅密植，一九五六年其他作物也全部实行适当密植。普遍引种优良品种，并实行浸种、拌种、防治虫害。5、改良土壤，扩大耕田面积。开发荒滩三百亩（已经开了一百五十亩），并且翻砂压土，改为良田，扩大耕地面积百分之三十五。另有三百亩耕地需压砂换土，改良土壤。6、培养农、林、牧业各种技术人员。为了保证农、林、牧生产都能很好地发展，准备培养一名畜牧兽医人员和一名林业技术员。其他技术人员（如养猪、养羊、修果树等）也需要抓紧培养。
    （二）进一步加强社的组织领导。这个社要在党支部的领导下，充分发挥党、团组织以及其他组织的作用，继续改进社长和社委会的工作，实行集体领导、分工负责、民主管理的领导方法。为了适应新的任务的要求，社委会准备吸收社内积极分子，组成农业、畜牧、林业、副业、文教卫生、财经、保卫等七个小组，具体分工负责这七个方面的工作。建立责任制及会议、汇报、总结评比、奖惩等各项制度。全社划分了三个生产队，实行包工包产制。并建立了监察委员会，负责监察各组、各队和全体社员执行计划和工作的情形，以保证规划任务的圆满完成。
