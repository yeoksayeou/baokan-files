Xinhua News Agency report: More than 80,000 rural postal stations have been established in rural areas nationwide. Most of these rural postal stations are located in the northeastern and northern provinces. Provinces such as Hebei, Shanxi, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have now established rural postal stations in almost every township (in the Northeast, it's administrative village). Liaoning Province has established rural postal stations in nearly half of its administrative villages. Shanxi Province has also established more than 10,000 mailing and delivery persons in natural villages to handle the receiving, sending, and delivering of newspapers and magazines. Hebei Province began to universally establish rural postal stations in April of this year, and now the number of rural postal stations has rapidly developed to more than 42,000, averaging more than three stations per township. Since Hebei Province universally established rural postal stations, the number of newspapers subscribed to by farmers throughout the province has increased by 25 percent. In some grassland areas north of Zhangjiakou, the delivery time of newspapers and magazines has also been shortened by two days compared to the past. Farmers in mountainous and grassland areas of Hebei Province have also voluntarily opened more than 3,700 postal routes.
　　These rural postal stations are established by the farmers themselves under the leadership of the local people's governments. After the establishment of rural postal stations, each village has a fixed person responsible for distributing newspapers, magazines, and letters, as well as receiving letters and subscribing to newspapers, which is both convenient and fast. Farmers can send letters and subscribe to newspapers without leaving the village.

    全国农村中已经建立八万多个乡邮站
    据新华社讯  全国农村中已经建立了八万多个乡邮站。这些乡邮站大部设在东北和华北各省。河北、山西、吉林、黑龙江等省现在差不多每个乡（东北是行政村）都已经设立了乡邮站。辽宁省已经有近半数的行政村设立了乡邮站。山西省还在自然村内设立了一万多个办理报刊邮件收发传递的收发员。河北省从今年四月开始普遍设立乡邮站，现在乡邮站已经迅速发展到四万二千多个，平均每个乡有三个站以上。河北省自从普遍设立乡邮站以后，全省农民订阅报纸的份数增加了百分之二十五。张家口以北一些草原地带，报刊传递时间也因此比过去缩短了两天。河北省山区和草原地带的农民群众，还自动开辟了三千七百多条邮路。
    这种乡邮站是在各地人民政府领导下，由农民群众自己建立起来的。设立了乡邮站以后，每个村就都有了固定负责的人办理分发报刊、信件和收寄信件、订阅报纸的工作，既方便，又迅速。农民群众寄信、订报，不用出村就能办妥。
