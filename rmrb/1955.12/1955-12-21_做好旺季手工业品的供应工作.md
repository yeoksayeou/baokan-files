    Do a Good Job in Supplying Handicraft Products During the Peak Season
    An Xingcun, Deputy Director of the Sales Bureau of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives
    Actively and proactively cooperating with state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperative departments to do a good job in the supply of handicraft products to meet the needs of farmers is a pressing task for handicraft workers and producers in various regions. Handicrafts are an important supplier of industrial products needed for farmers' lives and production. The demand for handicraft products in the national rural market has now increased even further. Since October, handicraft products such as small farm tools, furniture, women's hairnets, thimbles, and homespun cloth have been in short supply. In some southern provinces, even native paper is in short supply.
    There are reasons why handicraft products are in short supply. From the perspective of handicraft federations at all levels, the main reason is that they underestimated the increase in farmers' purchasing power during the peak season. They were hesitant in guiding production, and when the peak season arrived, they were caught off guard. For example, the Qiaoqi Handicraft Production Cooperative in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, produced thirty small rakes overnight with four stoves, and they were sold out in less than fifteen minutes the next morning. The Shengang team in Jiangyin County produced eighty hoes with two stoves for seven consecutive night shifts, and they were sold as soon as they were made. In the ironware cooperative in the county's urban area, farmers even slept at the door waiting for shovels. According to statistics from nine cooperatives and teams in three districts of Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, in the half-month from September 26 to October 10, twelve kinds of products that were out of stock, such as large shovels, sieves, and small stools, amounted to 22,400 pieces.
    There are also some shortcomings in sales work, which prevent some existing handicraft products from being well transported to consumers. In some areas, the following situation has occurred: the handicraft products in stock in production units and some wholesale links cannot be allocated, while the commodities in the retail links are out of stock. Some handicraft products produced in some places have always been sold in neighboring areas and are loved by the masses in the sales area. However, due to the mechanical implementation of the policy of "local materials, local processing, and local sales" by some local supply and marketing cooperatives, the sale of handicraft products from outside the region is restricted in the local area. This not only delays the needs of the masses, but also disrupts the sales rules of previous years, creating artificial sales difficulties. Especially after the state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives divided their work according to the operation of commodities, the disconnection between the two parties in the handover work has brought difficulties to the sales of handicraft products. For example, knives, scissors, and other products produced by the Suzhou Handicraft Cooperative in Jiangsu Province were originally operated by the supply and marketing cooperative. After the division of labor between state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives, they were assigned to state-owned commercial enterprises. The supply and marketing cooperative has stopped purchasing, but the state-owned commercial enterprise does not purchase because it has not received instructions from higher authorities. As a result, the sales of products of handicraft cooperatives (teams) have been difficult, and finally they were even forced to stop work and reduce production, resulting in a shortage of goods and affecting the peak season supply. For example, fifteen kinds of products, such as plane blades, axes, and adze heads, produced by the Weifang Handicraft Cooperative in Shandong, have always been sold throughout the country, but at present, due to no one being responsible for allocation, the products are stockpiled, and the masses in other places cannot buy them.
    Handicraft products are closely related to people's lives. Among the industrial products needed by farmers, handicraft products generally account for 60% to 70%, and in some places even as high as 80% or more. If the supply and marketing are not smooth, it will hinder the production and transformation of handicrafts and agriculture, hinder the withdrawal of state currency and affect the completion of the agricultural product purchase plan. This phenomenon should be eliminated immediately. Handicraft cooperative organizations in various regions, especially those responsible for promoting handicraft products, should take active actions and effective measures to cooperate with state-owned commercial and cooperative departments to strive to do a good job in the supply of commodities during the current peak season.
    First of all, we should strengthen the investigation and research of market conditions. We should understand the needs of the masses, the inventory of our departments, and the warehouse conditions of the operating departments. Then, according to the needs, we should rank the products and organize and guide the handicraft cooperatives (teams) to produce according to the required product specifications, quality, colors, styles, etc., to avoid blindness in production.
    Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of handicraftsmen, especially the staff of handicraft cooperatives (teams). In the past, some handicraft cooperatives (teams) produced shoddy products, cut corners, and raised prices when the peak season came. This phenomenon is even more common among unorganized handicraftsmen. Doing so not only damages the interests of consumers, but also blocks the sales of handicraft products. In order to reduce costs and improve product quality, handicraft cooperatives (teams) should be encouraged to play a leading role, pay attention to saving raw materials, strictly implement the production responsibility system, product inspection system, and reward and punishment system, and achieve "guaranteed quality, guaranteed repair, and guaranteed replacement" to meet the needs of the vast urban and rural people for handicraft products.
    Thirdly, it is necessary to take the initiative to contact state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives, and under the leadership of local party committees and governments, closely combine production and sales and balance production and sales plans to eliminate the phenomenon of product backlog or out of stock. When contacting state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives, we should adhere to the principle of mutual benefit, and in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, review past shortcomings and improve future work. After the contract is signed, both parties should strictly implement it and generally should not change it.
    Finally, in order to improve the quality of handicraft products and expand the scope of sales, handicraft federations in various regions should organize various handicraft cooperatives (teams) to participate in material exchange meetings and temple fairs at all levels, organize them to go to fairs and rural areas, and promote sales through various sales methods such as repair and sales (especially small farm tools), so that handicraft products can directly meet the masses, absorb consumers' opinions, and improve quality. For handicraft products produced and sold locally below the county level, in order to reduce circulation links and reduce the burden on consumers, the handicraft federation should organize grassroots production cooperatives (teams) or their joint wholesale departments (stores) to directly wholesale or retail to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, private small vendors, and consumers.
    Doing a good job in the supply of handicraft products is not only an important political task at present, but also a complex and meticulous organizational work. Handicraft federations at all levels should allocate certain full-time cadres to check and summarize the experience of this work in a timely manner, establish the idea of ​​serving consumers and relying on state-owned commerce, actively cooperate with state-owned commercial and cooperatives, strive to do a good job in peak season supply work, and complete the production plan of handicraft cooperatives (teams).

### 做好旺季手工业品的供应工作

    做好旺季手工业品的供应工作
    全国手工业生产合作总社筹备委员会推销局副局长  安性存
    积极主动地配合国营商业和供销合作社部门，做好手工业产品的供应工作以满足农民的需要，是当前各地手工业工作者和生产者的一项紧要任务。手工业是农民生活和生产所需要的工业品的重要供应者。全国农村市场现在对于手工业品的需要已经更加增长。自十月份以来，小农具、家具、妇女发网、顶针、土布等手工业产品，都供不应求。在南方的一些省份中，甚至连土纸也供不应求。
    手工业品供不应求，是有原因的。从各级手工业联社来说，主要是对旺季农民购买力的增长估计不足，在领导生产的时候，缩手缩脚，旺季来了，就措手不及。例如，江苏省江阴县峭岐手工业生产合作社，四只炉灶一夜间生产了三十把小钉耙，第二天一早不到十五分钟就销光了。江阴县申港小组两个炉灶一连开了七个夜工生产了八十把锄头，也是打好一把就卖掉一把。在这个县城区铁业社，还出现了农民睡在门口等锹的事情。据江苏省高邮县三个区九个社、组的统计，从九月二十六日到十月十日的半个月中，脱销的大锹、筛子、小凳等十二种产品就达二万二千四百件。
    销售工作方面也有一些缺点，致使某些现有的手工业产品不能很好地运到消费者手中。有些地区曾经出现这种情况：生产单位和一些批发环节库存的手工业品调拨不出去，而零售环节的商品却脱销。有些地方出产的手工业品本来一向销售于邻区，并且为销地群众所喜爱。可是，由于当地的某些供销合作社机械地执行“就地取材、就地加工、就地销售”的方针，竟限制外区手工业产品在当地销售。这样，不仅耽误了群众的需要，而且打乱了历年的销售规律，造成人为的推销困难。特别在国营商业、供销合作社按经营商品分工以后，由于双方在交接工作中有脱节现象，给手工业品的销售工作带来了困难。例如江苏省苏州市手工业合作社生产的刀子、剪子等，原来是由供销合作社经营的。国营商业和供销合作社分工后，划归国营商业经营。供销合作社已经停止收购，而国营商业因为没有接到上级指示，又不收购。结果手工业合作社（组）的产品销售发生了困难，最后甚至被迫停工减产，造成货源不足，影响了旺季供应。又如山东潍坊市手工业合作社生产的刨刃、斧头、锛头等十五种产品，历来行销全国，但是目前也因无人负责调拨，以致产品积压，外地群众又买不到。
    手工业品和人民生活有密切的关系。在农民所需要的工业品中，手工业品一般占到百分之六十到七十，个别地方甚至高达百分之八十以上。供销不畅通，就会妨碍手工业和农业的生产和改造，妨碍国家货币回笼和影响农产品收购计划的完成。应当立即消除这种现象。各地手工业合作组织，特别是负责推销手工业品的工作人员，应该积极地行动起来，采取有效措施，配合国营商业和合作社部门，努力做好目前旺季商品的供应工作。
    首先，应该加强对市场情况的调查研究工作。对于群众需要、本部门库存和经营部门的仓库情况，都应该有所了解。然后根据需要进行产品排队，按照需要的产品规格、质量、花色、样式等去组织和指导手工业社（组）进行生产，以避免生产上的盲目性。
    其次，要加强对手工业者，特别是手工业合作社（组）工作人员的政治思想教育工作。过去有些地方的手工业合作社（组）在旺季来临的时候，便粗制滥造、偷工减料、高抬价格。在没组织起来的手工业者中，这种现象更为普遍。这样做不但损害消费者的利益，也堵塞了手工业产品的销路。为了降低成本和提高产品质量，应该鼓励手工业合作社（组）发挥带头作用，注意节约原材料，严格贯彻执行生产责任制、产品检验制和奖惩制度，做到
  “保质、保修、保换”，满足广大城乡人民对手工业品的需求。
    再次，要主动地跟国营商业和供销合作社取得联系，在地方党委和政府的领导下，密切产销的结合和平衡产销计划，以消除产品积压或脱销的现象。在跟国营商业和供销合作社联系的时候，应该本着互利原则，以批评和自我批评的精神，检查过去缺点，改进今后的工作。合同签订后，双方都应该严格执行，一般不应该更改。
    最后，为了改进手工业产品质量和扩大销售范围，各地手工业联社应该组织各种手工业合作社（组）参加各级物资交流会和庙会，组织他们赶集和下乡，通过修配结合推销（特别是小农具）等多种多样的推销方法，使手工业品直接跟群众见面，吸取消费者的意见，以改进质量。县以下的就地生产就地销售的手工业品，为了减少流转环节，减轻消费者的负担，手工业联社应该组织基层生产合作社（组）或它们的联合批发部（门市部）直接对基层供销合作社、农业生产合作社、互助组、私商小贩、消费者批发或零售。
    做好手工业品的供应工作，在目前不仅是一个重要的政治任务，也是一项复杂的、细致的组织工作。各级手工业联社应该抽调一定的专职干部，及时对这项工作进行检查和总结经验，树立为消费者服务和依靠国营商业的思想，积极配合国营商业和合作社，努力做好旺季供应工作，完成手工业合作社（组）的生产计划。
