    Sino-Soviet Friendship is Growing
    Dechin Kohto Maung, Chairman of the Burma Council for World Peace, Stalin International Peace Prize Winner "Strengthening International Peace"
    On December 1, 1955, Marshal Nikolai Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Nikita Khrushchev, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, visited Burma. This visit was in response to an invitation extended by Burmese Prime Minister U Nu during his visit to the Soviet Union in November of this year.
    These reciprocal visits between the leaders of the two governments are not accidental events. They are the inevitable result of historical development.
    The first factor in this historical development is the Burmese people's struggle to liberate themselves from British colonial enslavement.
    In 1885, when British imperialists annexed the country, an independent Burma was wiped out. But the Burmese people did not give in. It took the British colonialists ten years to suppress the Burmese resistance movement, and even up to 1925, the British colonialists were unable to establish effective rule in some areas of northern and northwestern Burma. Even after the British colonialists announced the "pacification of the country" at the end of the 19th century, resistance incidents continued to erupt.
    It was only after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in Russia that the Burmese people's anti-colonialist struggle took on new characteristics. British imperialism built an "iron curtain" around Burma to prevent the ideas of the October Socialist Revolution from entering Burma. But ideas, especially revolutionary ideas, have no boundaries and cannot be stopped. The Burmese people began to learn "Bolshevik thought." The peasants, who constitute the main part of the Burmese people, began to understand that, according to "Bolshevik thought," land should be distributed to the peasants, and that peasants must abandon individual struggles and take the road of mass struggle. In 1930, Burmese peasants held an uprising, and the central slogan of the uprising was "land to the tiller."
    Following the peasant uprising was the 1938 oil workers' strike. Then, the student strike movement also arose. With the growth of the people's movement, Marxism-Leninism spread, and the Soviet experience became a model.
    During the Second World War, Burma fell under the iron heel of Japanese militarists. A brutal rule was imposed on the Burmese people. However, the heroic struggle of the Soviet people against the fascist bandits—the battles of Leningrad, Stalingrad, and Odessa—thrilled the Burmese people. The glorious struggle of the Soviet people against fascism inspired the Burmese people's struggle against Japanese militarism.
    The defeat of the Japanese militarists did not bring independence to Burma. British imperialism made a comeback, and the Burmese people continued to fight for liberation. Under the guidance of the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the struggle reached an unprecedented scale, finally enabling Burma to break free from the British colonial yoke and declare its independence in 1948.
    In September 1947, when the esteemed U Nu requested the parliament to pass the draft amendment to the Constitution of the Union of Burma, he said to the parliament:
    "I can now say that this (Constitution) will be left-wing. A so-called left-wing country, simply put, is a country that creates the following system: all citizens work together to the best of their ability, transform the natural resources underground and above ground into the goods people need, and then all citizens obtain these goods according to their needs. A country that has established such a system is a left-wing country. In such a left-wing country, there is no small group of people who control all the resources underground and above ground and live luxuriously and enjoy themselves to the fullest, while tens of thousands of people are trapped in hunger and poverty. In such a left-wing country, goods are not produced for profit, but to make people live happy lives. Moreover, there are no classes that command and classes that are commanded; to put it simply, there are no class distinctions such as masters and slaves, ruling classes and ruled classes. Simply put, the above-mentioned country is a left-wing country."
    These words reflect the profound influence of the great October Socialist Revolution among the broad masses of the Burmese people. In the same speech, U Nu also said: "I respect, value, and rely on the Soviet Union, because it is the bulwark of the oppressed people of the world (including Burma)." He accurately expressed the Burmese people's feelings towards the Soviet people.
    The second factor in the historical development process is the Burmese people's struggle for peace.
    The Burmese people want peace because only with peace can they consolidate their independence and sovereignty, eliminate all traces of colonial enslavement, and restore the wounds of the Second World War. They not only formally accept the preamble to the Charter of the United Nations, which declares "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind," but also consider it a basic condition for their survival. They support "to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security."
    But they found that the post-war world did not guarantee these aspirations. Colonial wars were being waged in Indonesia and Malaya; imperialism was interfering in the newly independent countries of Asia, artificially creating tensions between countries—all of which negated the peace and security that the Burmese people yearned for. The Burmese people had suffered from the aggression of the Kuomintang bandit troops supported by imperialism. Therefore, the Burmese people began to consciously fight to prevent a third world war and to maintain world peace.
    The liberation of China gave a great impetus to this struggle. The liberated Chinese people are a bastion of peace in Asia and the world, and the fact that the Burmese people live in a country neighboring China has strengthened the Burmese people's struggle for peace. On the issues of the Korean War, Taiwan, Indochina, China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, etc., the opinions of the Burmese people are consistent with those of the Chinese people. The great friendship, which had been interrupted by British imperialism for generations, has been restored. Missions between China and Burma traveled back and forth continuously.
    This has enabled the Burmese people to establish direct contact with the Soviet people in the struggle for peace. Under the help of the Chinese and Soviet people, the Burmese people have repeatedly sent representatives to visit the Soviet Union to strengthen peace and friendship. Workers, farmers, teachers, industrialists and bankers, monks, women, students and youth, legal workers, artists, writers, scientists, in fact, representatives of all walks of life in Burma have visited the Soviet Union. This activity culminated in the reciprocal visits of the leaders of the two countries and the establishment of close, friendly personal contacts between them.
    The direct contact thus established between the peace-loving Burmese people and the Soviet people, the bulwark of world peace, has further strengthened the Burmese people's struggle for peace. On major international issues such as the unconditional prohibition of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, disarmament, the abolition of military blocs, the restoration of China's legitimate status in the United Nations and the return of Taiwan to China, the establishment of economic and cultural exchanges between countries, the easing of international tensions, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the Burmese people are in agreement with the Soviet people.
    On this basis, the friendship between the Burmese people and the Soviet people must be solid.
    The third factor in the historical development process is the people's struggle for material and cultural progress.
    The long rule of the colonial regime has plunged the people into poverty, hindered the development of their talents, and disintegrated their economy. As U Nu said in the same speech, the Burmese people are all in the lowest and poorest position, and can only be satisfied with the bones left over by foreign capitalists. It takes a tremendous effort to end such a situation.
    But the imperialists are blocking the road. Not only do the British imperialists not help the Burmese people's struggle for economic independence and for material and cultural progress, but they also try their best to maintain their position in this country. They try their best to maintain the preferential tariff system; to subordinate the rupee to the pound sterling; their monopoly capitalists control the main industries, foreign trade and finance. But the Burmese people's struggle for independence is not to preserve the economic dominance of British monopoly capital. They have been able to abolish the preferential tariff system and to reclaim ownership of major enterprises such as the timber industry and inland waterway transport.
    American imperialists are doing their utmost to establish their foothold. Under the guise of economic cooperation, they infiltrate Burmese government agencies and want it to implement a disastrous economic plan, which is to make Burma continue to be a slave of the imperialists. This is intolerable to the Burmese people. The Economic Cooperation Administration has been spurned.
    On the other hand, when Burma faced difficulties due to the United States' attempt to squeeze Burmese rice out of its traditional markets and Britain's boycott of Burmese rice and lowering of rice prices, countries such as the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and Romania provided Burma with assistance, buying rice on terms most favorable to Burma. Not only that, these countries have also proposed economic cooperation that truly helps Burma achieve economic independence.
    The Burmese people understand that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a true bulwark for newly independent backward countries to achieve economic independence.
    On this basis, the friendship between the Burmese people and the Soviet people cannot but grow day by day.
    All this is the main outline of the historical development process.
    But there are interest groups and trends that are trying to undermine this process. There are imperialists who still harbor the intention of keeping Burma as their economic appendage. There are war-mongers who are trying to drag Burma into military blocs like the Southeast Asia Group. There are adventurers who hope to make a fortune in international tensions.
    But independence, peace, and material progress—these are the foundations on which the friendship between the Burmese people and the Soviet people is built. These foundations are solid, lasting, and powerful. The friendship between the Burmese and Soviet peoples will surely continue to grow, and is growing.
    Long live Burmese-Soviet friendship!
    Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!
    Long live the friendship of the people of the world!
    Long live world peace! (Special contribution to this newspaper)

    缅苏友谊在增长中
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会主席  “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人  德钦哥都迈
    一九五五年十二月一日，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁元帅和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫到缅甸进行访问。这次访问是应缅甸联邦吴努总理在今年十一月间访苏时所提出的邀请而实现的。
    两国政府领袖之间的这些相互访问，并不是偶然的事件。它们是必不可免的历史发展的结果。
    历史发展过程的第一个因素就是缅甸人民为了从英国的殖民奴役中解放出来而进行的斗争。
    一八八五年，当英国帝国主义者兼并了这个国家以后，一个独立的缅甸便被消灭了。但是，缅甸人民并没有屈服。英国殖民者费了十年时间来镇压缅甸的抵抗运动，甚至一直到一九二五年，英国殖民主义者还不可能在这个国家北部和西北部的某些地区建立有效的统治。即使是在十九世纪末期英国殖民者宣布“平定了这个国家”以后，仍然不断爆发抵抗事件。
    只是到了俄国十月社会主义革命胜利以后，缅甸人民的反殖民主义斗争才有了新的特征。英国帝国主义在缅甸的周围筑起一道“铁幕”，以防止十月社会主义革命的思想传入缅甸。但是，思想，特别是革命的思想，是没有境界的，是阻挡不了的。缅甸人民开始学习“布尔什维克思想”。构成缅甸人民主要部分的农民开始懂得，按照“布尔什维克思想”，土地是应该分配给农民的，并且农民必须放弃个人斗争而走向群众斗争的道路。一九三○年，缅甸农民举行起义，起义的中心口号就是耕者有其田。
    继农民起义而掀起的，是一九三八年石油工人的罢工。接着，学生的罢课运动也起来了。随着人民运动的增涨，马克思、列宁主义传播开来了，苏联的经验成了典范。
    在第二次世界大战期间，缅甸落在日本军国主义者的铁蹄之下。一个残暴的统治加在缅甸人民的头上。但是，苏联人民反抗法西斯匪徒的英勇斗争——列宁格勒、斯大林格勒和奥得萨战役——激动了缅甸人民。苏联人民反抗法西斯主义的光荣斗争，鼓舞了缅甸人民的反抗日本军国主义的斗争。
    日本军国主义者的失败，并没有给缅甸带来独立。英国帝国主义卷土重来，缅甸人民继续为争取解放而斗争。在马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的学说指导下，斗争达到了空前的规模，而终于使得缅甸摆脱了英国的殖民枷锁，于一九四八年宣布了它的独立。
    一九四七年九月，当可敬的吴努在国会要求通过缅甸联邦的宪法修正草案的时候，他向国会说：
  “我现在可以说，这（宪法）将是左翼的。所谓左翼国家，简单地说就是创造如下制度的国家：所有国民尽自己所能地共同劳动，把地下和地上的自然资源改变为人们所需的物品，然后一切国民按自己的需要取得这些物品。建立了这种制度的国家就是左翼国家。在这样的左翼国家内，没有一小撮人掌握着地下地上的一切资源，并奢侈豪华，尽情享受，而成千累万的人则陷于饥饿和贫困的现象。在这样的左翼国家内，生产物品并不是为了获得利润，而是为了使人民过幸福的生活。而且，那里没有指挥的阶级和被指挥的阶级；说简单一点，就是没有主人和奴隶、统治阶级和被统治阶级等阶级区别。简单说来，上述的国家就是左翼国家。”
    这些话反映出伟大的十月社会主义革命在广大的缅甸人民群众当中所起的深遽影响。吴努在同一篇演说里还说到：“我尊敬、重视并依赖苏联，因为它是世界被压迫人民（包括缅甸在内）的堡垒。”他确切地表达了缅甸人民对苏联人民的感情。
    历史发展过程的第二个因素是缅甸人民争取和平的斗争。
    缅甸人民要和平，因为有了和平才能巩固他们的独立和主权，消除一切殖民主义奴役的痕迹和恢复第二次世界大战的创伤。他们不仅是在形式上接受联合国宪章的序言中所宣告的：“欲免后世再遭今代人类两度身历惨不堪言之战祸”，而且认为这是他们生存的一个基本条件。他们拥护“力行容恕，彼此以善邻之道，和睦相处；集中力量，以维持国际和平及安全。”
    但是他们发现战后的世界并没有保证这些愿望。在印度尼西亚和马来亚进行着殖民战争；帝国主义对亚洲的新诞生的独立国家横加干涉，人为地在国家之间造成紧张状态——这些都是否定缅甸人民所渴望的和平和安全的。缅甸人民曾身受过由帝国主义支持的国民党匪军的侵略。因此缅甸人民开始自觉地为制止第三次世界大战和维护世界和平而斗争。
    中国的解放给予这个斗争以巨大的推动力。解放了的中国人民是亚洲以及全世界的和平的堡垒，而缅甸人民生活在一个与中国为邻的国度里这一事实，加强了缅甸人民的争取和平的斗争。在朝鲜战争、台湾、印度支那、中国在联合国的合法权利等等问题上，缅甸人民的意见是和中国人民的意见一致的。历代相传的、由于英帝国主义而中断的伟大友谊，又恢复了。中、缅两国之间使团往来不息。
    这使得缅甸人民能够在争取和平的斗争中建立和苏联人民的直接联系。在中、苏人民的帮助下，缅甸人民屡屡派遣代表访问苏联，以加强和平和友谊。工人、农民、教员、工业家和银行家、和尚、妇女、学生和青年、法律工作者、艺术家、作家、科学家，事实上，缅甸各阶层人民的代表都访问了苏联。这种活动以两国的政府领袖的相互访问和彼此之间建立起亲密的、友好的个人接触而达到最高潮。
    热爱和平的缅甸人民和世界和平的堡垒的苏联人民之间这样建立起来的直接接触，进一步加强了缅甸人民的争取和平的斗争。在无条件禁止核子和热核子武器、裁减军备、废除军事集团、恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位和把台湾归还中国、在国家之间建立经济和文化交流、和缓国际紧张局势和和平共处五原则等重大国际问题上，缅甸人民是跟苏联人民一致的。
    在这样的基础上，缅甸人民和苏联人民之间的友谊必然是牢固的。
    历史发展过程的第三个因素是人民为争取物质和文化进步而斗争。
    殖民政权的长期统治，使人民陷于贫困，阻碍他们才能的发展以及使他们的经济瓦解。正如吴努在同一演说中所说的，缅甸人都是处在最下层最贫穷的地位，只能满足于外国资本家所吃剩的骨头。这需要巨大的努力来结束这样一种状况。
    但是，帝国主义者挡着道路。英国帝国主义者不仅对缅甸人民为争取经济独立和争取物质和文化进步的斗争不予帮助，而且想尽办法保持他们在这个国家的阵地。他们想尽办法维持特惠关税制度；使卢比从属于英镑；他们的垄断资本家掌握着主要的工业、对外贸易和金融。但是缅甸人民为争取独立而斗争不是要保存英国垄断资本的经济支配的。他们能够废除特惠关税制度，以及收回像木材业和内河航运业等主要企业的所有权。
    美国帝国主义者竭尽其力想建立他们的立足点。他们打着经济合作的招牌，渗入缅甸的政府机构，要它实行一个灾难性的经济计划，这个计划是要使缅甸继续成为帝国主义者的奴仆。这是缅甸人民所不能容忍的。经济合作署遭到了唾弃。
    另一方面，当缅甸由于美国要把缅甸的大米排挤出它的传统市场以及英国抵制缅甸的大米和压低米价而面对困难的时候，苏联、中华人民共和国、罗马尼亚等国家却给了缅甸以援助，用对缅甸最有利的条件买去了大米。不仅这样，这些国家还提议进行真正有助于缅甸实现经济独立的经济合作。
    缅甸人民明白，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是使新近取得独立的落后国家获得经济独立的真正堡垒。
    在这样的基础上，缅甸人民和苏联人民之间的友谊不能不日益增长。
    这一切就是历史发展过程的主要梗概。
    但是有着竭力想破坏这种进程的利益集团和趋势。有着帝国主义者，他们仍然怀着想把缅甸保留为他们经济附庸的打算。有着战争贩子，他们企图把缅甸拖进像东南亚集团这样的军事集团。有着冒险家，他们希望在国际紧张局势中发财。
    但是，独立、和平和物质进步——这是缅甸人民和苏联人民友谊建立的基础。这些基础是坚固、持久和富有力量的。缅苏人民的友谊一定将继续增长，而且正在增长中。
    缅苏友好万岁！
    缅中友好万岁！
    全世界人民友好万岁！
    世界和平万岁！　　（本报特约稿）
