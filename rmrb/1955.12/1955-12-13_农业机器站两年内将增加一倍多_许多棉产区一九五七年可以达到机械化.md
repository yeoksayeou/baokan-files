    Agricultural Machine Stations to More Than Double in Two Years
    Many Cotton-Producing Areas Can Achieve Mechanization by 1957
    (Our newspaper reports) To meet the needs of increased grain and cotton production and the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the state will rapidly develop agricultural machine and tractor stations in the next two years. The Ministry of Agriculture has determined that 164 new agricultural machine and tractor stations will be established in the last two years of the First Five-Year Plan, which is more than double the existing number of agricultural machine and tractor stations. By 1957, there will be 290 agricultural machine and tractor stations nationwide, with 8,416 standard tractors, serving an area of 19 million mu, of which 11.5 million mu will be mechanically cultivated cotton fields, greatly exceeding the targets set by the First Five-Year Plan. Most of these new stations will be established in major cotton-producing areas, and by 1957, many cotton-producing areas will be able to achieve mechanization. Currently, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Anhui, Hubei, and other provinces have begun preparations for establishing 113 stations in 1956.
    There are now 126 agricultural machine and tractor stations nationwide, with 2,135.3 standard tractors, serving an area of 2.95 million mu, which is five times the mechanically cultivated area in 1954. The land cultivated by various agricultural machine and tractor stations for state-owned farms, collective farms, and agricultural producers' cooperatives has generally achieved bumper harvests this year. According to statistics from thirteen agricultural machine and tractor stations in Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Anhui, Beijing, and other places, the 27,500 mu of winter wheat that they mechanically cultivated in the winter of 1954 generally yielded about 40% more than the wheat grown on land cultivated by livestock. According to a survey of fourteen agricultural machine and tractor stations in Heilongjiang Province, due to mechanical cultivation and the adoption of other advanced agricultural technologies, the yields of the land they operated on all exceeded the yields of ordinary farmland in the area by more than 30%. This year, the Wu'an Agricultural Machine and Tractor Station in Hebei Province cultivated more than 3,600 mu of cotton fields for agricultural producers' cooperatives, averaging more than 270 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of more than 80 jin compared to cotton fields cultivated by animal power. Because agricultural machine and tractor stations used machines to cultivate the land, collective farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives also saved a large amount of labor and animal power, thereby strengthening land processing, reclamation, and farmland water conservancy projects.
    The peasants near these agricultural machine and tractor stations, seeing the fact that agricultural producers' cooperatives increased grain and cotton production through mechanical cultivation, are more enthusiastically joining agricultural producers' cooperatives. After seeing the benefits of tractor cultivation, the peasants in the Hushan District, where the Kunlun County Agricultural Machine and Tractor Station in Shandong Province is located, have all requested to join the cooperatives, and now the number of households joining the cooperatives has reached about 90% of the total number of households in the district. To facilitate mechanical cultivation, twenty-four large cooperatives with more than one hundred households each have also been established in the district. The areas served by other agricultural machine and tractor stations have also largely achieved basic cooperativization.

### 农业机器站两年内将增加一倍多  许多棉产区一九五七年可以达到机械化

    农业机器站两年内将增加一倍多
    许多棉产区一九五七年可以达到机械化
    本报讯　为了适应粮棉增产和农业合作化高潮的需要，在今后的两年内，国家将迅速发展农业机器拖拉机站。农业部已经确定在第一个五年计划的后两年内要新建立农业机器拖拉机站一百六十四处，相当于现有农业机器拖拉机站的一倍多。到一九五七年全国将有农业机器拖拉机站二百九十处、拖拉机八千四百一十六标准台，服务面积一千九百万亩，其中机耕的棉田要达到一千一百五十万亩，大大超过第一个五年计划规定的指标。这些新站大部分将建立在主要产棉的地区，到一九五七年的时候，许多棉产区可以达到机械化。目前，河北、山西、山东、河南、陕西、江苏、辽宁、安徽、湖北等省已经开始进行在一九五六年建立一百一十三个站的筹备工作。
    现在全国有一百二十六个农业机器拖拉机站，拖拉机有二千一百三十五点三标准台，服务面积达二百九十五万亩，比一九五四年机耕面积扩大了五倍。各农业机器拖拉机站给国营农场、集体农庄和农业生产合作社耕种的土地今年普遍获得丰产。据山西、山东、河南、陕西、安徽、北京等地十三个农业机器拖拉机站的统计，一九五四年冬季它们用机器耕种的二万七千五百多亩冬小麦，今年夏收一般比当地畜耕地小麦增产百分之四十左右。黑龙江省据十四个农业机器拖拉机站的调查，由于机械耕作和采用其他先进的农业技术，它们进行作业的土地产量都超过当地一般农田百分之三十以上。河北省武安农业机器拖拉机站今年替农业生产合作社耕种的三千六百多亩棉田，平均每亩产籽棉二百七十多斤，比畜力耕种的棉田增产八十多斤。各集体农庄和农业生产合作社由于农业机器拖拉机站用机器代为耕作，还节省了大批劳动力、畜力，因而加强了土地加工、开荒、兴修农田水利等工作。
    这些农业机器拖拉机站附近的农民看到农业生产合作社用机械耕作增产粮食和棉花的事实，更加踊跃地参加农业生产合作社。山东省昆仑县农业机器拖拉机站所在的虎山区的农民看到拖拉机耕种的好处以后，都纷纷要求入社，现在入社农户已达到全区总农户的百分之九十左右。为了便于机耕，全区还办了二十四个百户以上的大社。其他农业机器拖拉机站服务的地区也大都达到了基本上合作化。
