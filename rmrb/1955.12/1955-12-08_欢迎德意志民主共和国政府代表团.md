    Welcoming the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic
    The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, will arrive in Beijing today for a friendly visit to our country. The visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to our country at the invitation of the government of the People's Republic of China is a manifestation of the growing brotherly friendship between the people of our two countries and the continuous strengthening and consolidation of the relations of solidarity and cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese people warmly welcome the arrival of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic and are very pleased with this important development in the friendly relations between our two countries.
    The People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are both countries that were born in 1949. The people of our two countries are doing their best to build a beautiful socialist cause; at the same time, our two countries are also at the forefront of the great struggle against imperialism and in defense of peace. The common desire of the people of our two countries to build socialism and safeguard peace has forged a deep and unbreakable friendship between the people of the two countries, and established sincere cooperative relations between the two countries. This relationship is not only reflected in the fact that the two countries support each other in order to achieve common economic progress, but also in the joint efforts made by the two countries to strengthen international peace cooperation and ease international tensions.
    The Chinese people are proud to have such a strong brotherly country as the German Democratic Republic. The German Democratic Republic is the first state of workers and peasants in German history. It embodies the German people's long-standing aspirations for peace, democracy, and friendly cooperation with the people of other countries, and has become a reliable fortress for the peace-loving and democratic forces of the German people. It has not only opened a new historical period for Germany's development towards democracy and freedom, but also changed the face of Europe due to the emergence of such an important force for defending peace in the heart of Europe.
    In the six years since its establishment, the German Democratic Republic has gone through a glorious path. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party, the working people of democratic Germany have eliminated the economic forces of monopoly capital and landlords, as well as the political and economic foundations of militarism, and established their own state system and social system. Despite the various conspiracies of the enemy, the state system and social system of the German Democratic Republic are now more consolidated than ever. The German Democratic Republic has made significant achievements on the road of socialist construction, and its economy is growing year by year. As the first five-year plan is about to be completed this year, the republic's industrial production will increase to twice that of pre-war levels. At present, the socialist component accounts for about 86 percent of the entire industry. In agriculture, the socialist component is also constantly gaining new victories, and the number of agricultural production cooperatives and machine tractor stations is increasing year by year. The Republic strives to expand its economic ties with other countries, and now trades with about 100 countries. The increase in the total value of foreign trade this year will be about three times that of 1950. The people's living standards have improved significantly. The Republic's government is deeply loved and trusted by all residents; the government of the German Democratic Republic also enjoys high prestige among a wide range of people in West Germany.
    The German Democratic Republic pursues a policy of peace and friendship in international affairs and has achieved many successes, thereby increasing its position and role in international affairs. Now, many countries in Europe and Asia with a total population of about one billion have recognized the German Democratic Republic as an independent sovereign state and are developing friendly and cooperative relations with it on the basis of equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. Especially due to the treaty on relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic signed in September this year, the German Democratic Republic has obtained complete freedom to resolve its internal and foreign affairs, including resolving its relations with the Federal Republic of Germany and developing relations with other countries. This further strengthens the international status of the German Democratic Republic.
    The German Democratic Republic plays a particularly important role in maintaining peace in Europe and striving for the restoration of Germany's peaceful reunification. It has always actively strived to ensure peace in Europe and resolutely supported the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a European collective security system; at the same time, it regards the promotion of Germany's peaceful reunification as its primary task. In order to promote European security and the resolution of the German question, the government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement during the Foreign Ministers' Conference, stating that it was prepared to accept the rights and obligations of the participating countries in the Pan-European Collective Security Treaty in order to contribute to the cause of ensuring peace in Europe and create external conditions for the restoration of Germany's peaceful reunification. In this statement, it also proposed that the parliaments of the two Germanys establish an All-German Committee to promote the rapprochement of Germans in West and East Germany and to organize cooperation in all aspects of internal relations in Germany, thereby creating internal conditions for the restoration of Germany's unity. This proposal of the German Democratic Republic fully conforms to the interests and aspirations of all the German people, and also conforms to the interests and aspirations of the people of all European countries.
    The Foreign Ministers' Conference's discussion of European security and the German question failed to reach any agreement due to the Western foreign ministers' insistence on their unreasonable position of remilitarizing the whole of Germany and making the whole of Germany participate in the Western countries' aggressive blocs. However, the proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on establishing a European collective security system and establishing an All-German Committee have increasingly gained popularity. A wide range of people in West Germany fully support the proposal to establish an All-German Committee, and more than 100 public leaders in West Germany have established the "Organization of Supporters of German Reunification and Agreement Between Peoples" to promote the rapprochement between East and West Germany. Recently, according to the proposal of the German Democratic Republic, representatives from the two parts of Germany have held negotiations on the issue of German domestic trade in 1956. All these circumstances show that the German Democratic Republic is increasingly attracting more and more extensive peace-loving and democratic forces in all of Germany, and is playing an increasingly prominent role in maintaining peace in Europe and promoting German reunification.
    From the day the German Democratic Republic was founded, the Chinese people have had deep sympathy and friendship for democratic Germany and the peace-loving and democratic German people, and fully support their struggle to safeguard peace in Europe and strive for the peaceful reunification of Germany. The Chinese people have also received support from the German Democratic Republic and the German people in their struggle against imperialist aggressors. The determination of our two peoples to support each other in the common struggle is vividly expressed in the communique issued by the Prime Ministers of China and Germany on July 25, 1954. On April 7 this year, Chairman Mao Zedong issued an order on ending the state of war between the People's Republic of China and Germany. This order pointed out: "The People's Republic of China firmly supports the German Democratic Republic and the entire German people, as well as the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and people, in their struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of Germany, promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, ensure European collective security and safeguard world peace." This determination of the Chinese people is firm. Because peace in Europe and Asia is closely related and inseparable, the struggle to maintain peace in Europe will inevitably help consolidate peace in Asia. The solidarity, co-operation and mutual support between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic in the common struggle are important factors in safeguarding peace in Europe, peace in Asia and peace throughout the world.
    The continuous enhancement of the friendly relations between our two countries is also reflected in the increasing development of economic and cultural ties between the two countries. The volume of trade between our two countries is growing year by year, which plays an important role in helping the peaceful construction and the upward trend of economic life in both countries. Frequent and increasing cultural exchanges have further promoted the rapid growth of friendship between the two peoples.
    On the basis of such deep friendship between the two countries, the visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to our country will undoubtedly have great significance for further strengthening the solidarity and cooperation between the two countries and for consolidating the peaceful development of the two countries and the cause of world peace. After visiting our country, the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic will also visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Mongolian People's Republic. This fully demonstrates the continuous strengthening and consolidation of the friendly relations between the countries of the democratic and socialist camp and the growing strength of the democratic and socialist camp.
    The Chinese people sincerely wish the continuous consolidation of the friendship between China and Germany, and wish the German Democratic Republic new and greater achievements in the cause of building socialism, maintaining peace, and promoting the peaceful reunification of Germany.

    欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团
    以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团将于今日到达北京，对我国进行友好访问。德意志民主共和国政府代表团应中华人民共和国政府的邀请前来我国访问，是我们两国人民兄弟般的亲密友谊日益增长和两国之间的团结合作关系不断加强和巩固的表现。中国人民热烈欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团的到来，对于我们两国友好关系的这一重要发展感到非常高兴。
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国都是在一九四九年诞生的国家。我们两国人民都在全力进行着建设社会主义的美好事业；同时我们两国又同处在反对帝国主义、维护和平的伟大斗争的最前线。我们两国人民这种建设社会主义和维护和平事业的共同愿望，使两国人民结成了牢不可破的深厚友谊，并在两国之间建立了真诚的合作关系。这种关系不但表现在两国为了求得共同的经济高涨而相互支援的事实上，同时也表现在两国为了加强国际和平合作和缓和国际紧张局势而作的共同努力中。
    中国人民因为有德意志民主共和国这样一个坚强的兄弟国家而感到自豪。德意志民主共和国是德国历史上第一个工农国家。它体现了德国人民多年来争取和平、民主以及同其他国家人民友好合作的愿望，成为德国人民爱好和平的民主力量的可靠堡垒。它不但为德国的发展打开了通往民主和自由的新的历史时期，并且由于在欧洲的心脏地带出现了这样一个保卫和平的重要力量，改变了欧洲的面貌。
    德意志民主共和国在成立以来的六年多的时间中，走过了一段光辉的道路。民主德国的劳动人民在统一社会党的领导下消灭了垄断资本和地主的经济势力以及军国主义的政治和经济的基础，建立了自己的国家制度和社会制度。尽管敌人进行各种阴谋诡计，德意志民主共和国的国家制度和社会制度现在比任何时候都更加巩固了。德意志民主共和国在社会主义建设的道路上已经取得了重大的成就，它的经济一年一年地增长。由于第一个五年计划即将在今年完成，共和国的工业生产将增加为战前的两倍。目前，社会主义成份在整个工业中已经占到百分之八十六左右。在农业方面社会主义成份也不断地获得新的胜利，农业生产合作社和机器拖拉机站的数目在逐年增加。共和国努力扩大同其他国家的经济联系，现在已同大约一百个国家进行着贸易，今年对外贸易总额的增加大约将达到一九五○年的三倍。人民生活水平有了显著的提高。共和国政府受到全体居民的深刻的爱戴和信任；在西德的广泛阶层人士中，德意志民主共和国政府也有着很高的威信。
    德意志民主共和国在国际事务中执行着和平和友好的政策，获得了许多成就，从而使它在国际事务中所处的地位和所起的作用日益增长。现在一共约有十亿人口的欧洲和亚洲的许多国家已经承认德意志民主共和国为独立的主权国家，并且同它在平等、互相尊重主权和互不干涉内政的基础上发展着友好合作的关系。特别由于今年九月签订的苏联和德意志民主共和国的关系条约，德意志民主共和国已获得了解决它的内政和外交问题，包括解决它同德意志联邦共和国的关系以及发展同其他国家关系的完全自由。这就更进一步加强了德意志民主共和国的国际地位。
    德意志民主共和国在维护欧洲和平和争取恢复德国和平统一的事业中，起着特别重要的作用。它一贯积极地为保障欧洲和平而努力，并坚决支持苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的主张；同时，它把促进德国的和平统一作为它的首要任务。为了促进欧洲安全和德国问题的解决，德意志民主共和国政府曾在四国外长会议期间发表声明，表示它准备接受全欧集体安全条约参加国的权利和义务，以便为保障欧洲和平事业作出贡献，并创造恢复德国和平统一的外部条件。在这个声明中，它还建议由两个德国的议会建立全德委员会，以促进西德同东德的德国人的接近，并组织德国内部关系的各方面的合作，这样来为恢复德国的统一创造内部的条件。德意志民主共和国的这个主张完全符合于全体德国人民的利益和愿望，也符合于欧洲各国人民的利益和愿望。
    四国外长会议对于欧洲安全和德国问题的讨论，由于西方国家外长坚持其使全德重新军国主义化，并使全德参加西方国家侵略集团的无理立场，而没有取得任何协议。但是，苏联和德意志民主共和国关于建立欧洲集体安全体系和建立全德委员会的主张，却已日益深入人心。西德广泛阶层人士全力支持建立全德委员会的建议，西德一百多名公众领袖并成立了“德国重新统一和各国人民间协议拥护者组织”，来促进东西德的接近。最近，根据德意志民主共和国的建议，德国两部分的代表已就一九五六年的德国国内贸易问题进行谈判。这一切情形表明，德意志民主共和国日益吸引着越来越为广泛的全德爱好和平民主的力量，而在维护欧洲和平和促进德国统一的事业中起着越来越为显著的作用。
    中国人民从德意志民主共和国成立的一天起，就对民主德国和爱好和平民主的德国人民怀着深切的同情和友谊，并全力支持他们为维护欧洲和平和争取德国和平统一而进行的斗争。中国人民在反对帝国主义侵略者的斗争中，同样也获得德意志民主共和国和德国人民的支持。我们两国人民在共同斗争中的相互支持的决心，生动地表现在中德两国总理在一九五四年七月二十五日发表的会谈公报中。今年四月七日毛泽东主席发布了关于结束中华人民共和国同德国之间的战争状态的命令，这个命令指出：“中华人民共和国坚决支持德意志民主共和国和全德人民以及苏联和所有爱好和平的国家和人民为争取德国和平统一、促进对德和约的缔结、保障欧洲集体安全和维护世界和平的斗争”。中国人民的这种决心是坚定的。因为欧洲和亚洲的和平是密切相关而不可分割的，维护欧洲和平的斗争，必将有助于巩固亚洲的和平。中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国在共同斗争中的团结合作和相互支持，是维护欧洲和平和亚洲和平以及全世界和平的重要因素。
    我们两国友好关系的不断增进，也表现在两国的经济和文化联系的日益发展上。我们两国的贸易数额一年比一年增长，这对于帮助两国的和平建设和经济生活的向上起着重要的作用。经常的和日益发展的文化交流，更促进了两国人民友谊的迅速增长。
    在两国这样深厚友谊的基础上，德意志民主共和国政府代表团来到我国访问，对于进一步加强两国的团结合作关系，对于巩固两国的和平发展和世界和平事业，无疑都将有着重大的意义。德意志民主共和国政府代表团在访问我国之后，并将到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国进行访问。这充分表明了民主、社会主义阵营各国之间友好关系的不断加强和巩固和民主、社会主义阵营力量的日益强大。
    中国人民衷心愿望中德两国友谊的不断巩固，并祝德意志民主共和国在建设社会主义、维护和平以及促进德国和平统一的事业中获得新的更大的成就。
