When signing the Sino-German Cultural Cooperation Agreement and the Sino-German Agreement on Cooperation in Plant Quarantine and Prevention and Control of Crop Diseases and Insect Pests, the Chinese side was represented by Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture of the People's Republic of China, and Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture, respectively, and the German Democratic Republic side was represented by Dr. Lothar Bolz, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic.

When signing the Joint Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the German Democratic Republic, the Chinese side was represented by Premier Zhou Enlai, and the German Democratic Republic side was represented by Premier Otto Grotewohl.

Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at the signing ceremony, saying: Respected Prime Minister Grotewohl, Respected comrades of the German Democratic Republic government delegation:

During your visit to China, the government delegations of our two countries held talks on the issue of further developing comprehensive cooperative relations between the two countries. Today, we are here to conclude the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, and have signed the Sino-German Cultural Cooperation Agreement and the Sino-German Agreement on Cooperation in Plant Quarantine and Prevention and Control of Crop Diseases and Insect Pests. The signing of this treaty and these agreements marks a further development and consolidation of the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. Please allow me, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, to express my warm congratulations to you, Prime Minister, and to all the comrades of the German Democratic Republic government delegation.

After the end of the anti-fascist war, the German Democratic Republic was established on the land of Germany. This momentous event marked a turning point in European history. Standing at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism in the West, the German Democratic Republic is a staunch member of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp. Its existence and development strongly encourages the Chinese people in their struggle in the East to defend peace in Asia and the world. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "In the era of imperialism, the true people's revolution in any country, without the assistance of international revolutionary forces in various ways, cannot achieve its own victory. After victory, it is impossible to consolidate it." The Chinese people were able to achieve revolutionary victory after World War II, and were able to consolidate and build their own country after victory, which is inseparable from the assistance of the German revolutionary forces.

Now, both of our countries are engaged in socialist construction, and our goals are consistent. Our common desire is to support each other, learn from each other, consolidate our friendship, and strengthen our unity. The treaty we have concluded and the agreements we have signed are not only beneficial to the people of our two countries, but also to the cause of defending world peace and striving for human progress. I firmly believe that the work we have accomplished today will be welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world.

Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl then delivered a speech, saying: Respected Premier, Dear Chinese friends!

The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation just signed will greatly strengthen the relationship between our two countries and peoples. We are confident that through this treaty, the existing, comprehensive, close and friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China in the political, economic, cultural and other fields will be further consolidated and developed. The German people are excited because they know that they have a strong ally - the powerful People's Republic of China. Our ally fully agrees with us on the necessity and the path to rebuild a peace-loving, democratic, and unified Germany. Just as this is conducive to guaranteeing peace in Europe, the German Democratic Republic government's full agreement with the just demands of the Asian countries that have been liberated from colonialism or are engaged in the liberation struggle is undoubtedly also conducive to peace in Asia.

Our government delegation will return to Germany with good results. We have confirmed that our views on major issues of decisive significance concerning our two countries coincide with those of our Chinese friends.

The reason why we have such common views is because both of our countries have overthrown the rule of domestic reactionary exploiting classes and established a worker-peasant regime. Both of our countries are building the foundations of socialism, constantly developing our national economy in a planned way, and the beautiful life of the people is improving. Therefore, we urgently need peace. It is precisely for this reason that we have reached a consensus to do everything in our power to safeguard world peace and strive for the progress of mankind. Both sides have expressed their willingness to participate in all international actions conducive to consolidating world peace and ensuring collective security.

We firmly believe that the United States will no longer be able to use its puppet Chiang Kai-shek clique for a long time, and the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations will not be occupied for long.
  Similarly, China's recovery of Taiwan and the end of colonialism in Asia have become inevitable trends.

We return home with joyful confidence because we know that the cause of peace in Asia is in such strong hands. We ask you to accept our guarantee: we in Germany will do everything in our power to eliminate the crisis of a new war breaking out in Europe.

The German people will eliminate the rule of militarism, Junkers and monopoly capital in West Germany, and pave the way for the security of all peoples and the unification of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy. Dear Chinese friends, we are confident of gaining your support and strongly felt your friendship during our stay, which will help our struggle and guarantee our final victory.

After the speeches, both sides shook hands and raised their glasses to congratulate each other.

    在签署中华人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府联合声明时，中华人民共和国方面由周恩来总理签字，德意志民主共和国方面由奥托·格罗提渥总理签字。
    周恩来总理在签字仪式上致词说：敬爱的格罗提渥总理同志，敬爱的德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志们：
    在你们访问中国期间，我们两国的政府代表团，就进一步发展两国全面合作关系的问题进行了会谈。今天，我们在这里缔结了中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国友好合作条约，并且签订了中德文化合作协定和中德关于植物检疫和防治农作物病虫害合作的协定。这个条约和这些协定的签订，标志着我们两国友好合作关系进一步的发展和巩固。请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府，向你，总理同志，向德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志们，表示热烈的祝贺。
    反法西斯战争结束以后，在德意志的土地上建立了德意志民主共和国。这个巨大的事件标志着欧洲历史的转折点。处在反对帝国主义斗争的西方最前线的德意志民主共和国是和平民主社会主义阵营坚强的一员，它的存在和发展有力地鼓舞着中国人民在东方保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争。毛泽东同志说过，“在帝国主义存在的时代，任何国家的真正的人民革命，如果没有国际革命力量在各种不同方式上的援助，要取得自己的胜利是不可能的。胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的。”中国人民能够在第二次世界大战后取得革命的胜利，在胜利后能够巩固和建设自己的国家，这是同德意志革命力量的援助分不开的。
    现在，我们两国都在进行社会主义建设，我们的目标是一致的。我们共同的愿望是互相支援，互相学习，巩固我们的友谊，加强我们的团结。我们缔结的条约和签订的协定，不仅有利于我们两国人民，而且有利于保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的事业。我深信，我们今天所完成的工作将受到全世界爱好和平的人民的欢迎。
    奥托·格罗提渥总理接着致词说：尊敬的总理同志！敬爱的中国朋友们！
    方才签订的友好合作条约将大大地加强我们两国和人民之间的关系。我们确信，通过这个条约，德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国之间政治、经济、文化和其他各方面、现有的、全面的密切友好关系，将获得进一步巩固和发展。德意志人民感到兴奋，因为他们知道，他们有着一个强大的盟国——强大的中华人民共和国。对于重建一个爱好和平、民主、统一的德国的必要性及其途径，我们的盟国是完全同意我们的。正如这是有利于保障欧洲和平的，同样，对于已经从殖民主义获得解放或正在进行解放斗争的亚洲各国人民的正义要求，德意志民主共和国政府的完全同意，无疑也是有利于亚洲的和平的。
    我们政府代表团将带着良好的结果回到德国。我们证实了，在有关我们两国的、有决定意义的重大问题上，我们的见解是同我们的中国朋友的见解相符合的。
    我们所以有这样共同的见解，是因为我们两国都推翻了国内反动剥削阶级的统治和建立了工农政权。我们两国都在建立社会主义的基础，有计划地不断地发展我们的国民经济，人民的美好的生活正在提高。因此，我们迫切需要和平。也正因为这样，我们双方取得了一致的意见，要尽我们的一切力量来维护世界和平和争取人类的进步，我们双方都表示：准备参加一切有利于巩固世界和平和保障集体安全的国际行动。
    我们深信，美国将不能再长久利用它的傀儡蒋介石集团，中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位将不能长久被霸占。
  同样，中国收复台湾和在亚洲的殖民主义的终结，已经成为必不可免的趋势。
    我们抱着愉快的信心回国，因为我们知道，亚洲的和平事业是掌握在如此坚强的手中。我们请你们接受我们的保证：我们在德国将尽一切力量消除欧洲新战争爆发的危机。
    德意志人民将消除在西德的军国主义、容克地主和垄断资本的统治，为各国人民的安全和在和平、民主的基础上统一德国开辟道路。亲爱的中国朋友们，我们有把握获得你们的支持和在我们逗留的期间强烈感觉到你们的友谊，这些有助于我们的斗争，并保证我们的最后胜利。
    在讲话以后，双方握手和举杯互相祝贺。
