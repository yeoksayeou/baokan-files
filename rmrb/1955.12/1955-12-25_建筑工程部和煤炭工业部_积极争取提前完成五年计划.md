Xinhua News Agency, December 24th. Minister of Construction Engineering Liu Xiufeng told our reporter today: The Ministry of Construction Engineering can complete the construction and installation tasks of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. According to the plan recently formulated by the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the construction and installation workload in 1956 will be increased by more than 26% compared with the original annual contracted plan indicators, and will be doubled compared with the actual workload completed in 1955. At present, the units entrusted with construction by the Ministry of Construction Engineering are continuing to increase the workload for 1956. Therefore, the construction workload of the Ministry of Construction Engineering next year will be greatly increased. In this way, the Ministry of Construction Engineering has the conditions to strive to complete the construction and installation plan of the first five years ahead of schedule.

Liu Xiufeng said: In order to ensure the early completion of the five-year construction and installation plan, the Ministry of Construction Engineering is drafting various measures. According to the initially drafted measures plan, the Ministry of Construction Engineering plans to greatly advance the design progress and strive to issue drawings as soon as possible. Some dormitory projects originally planned to be constructed in the second and third quarters of next year will be advanced to the first quarter using old drawings from 1955, and large-scale winter construction will continue to be carried out to ensure the balance of construction throughout the year and strive to do more work. In order to improve labor productivity, ensure project quality and reduce project costs, the level of factory and mechanized construction will be improved next year, the professional construction forces of industrial pipelines, sanitary technology, electromechanical installation and metal structure installation will be strengthened, and advanced experience will be widely promoted in design and construction. Now the Ministry of Construction Engineering has begun to train workers to drive construction machinery in a planned way, and is also preparing to build more than 20 production enterprises, including reinforced concrete component prefabrication plants, mechanized quarries, etc., and is preparing to establish large-scale permanent construction production bases in some cities. Next year, dozens of major advanced experiences are planned to be promoted in construction and design. These advanced experiences can greatly accelerate the efficiency of design and construction. For example, promoting the Soviet Union's advanced experience—integrated hoisting method—which has been successfully tested in factory building construction, can accelerate the project progress by 30% and save 30% of the labor force; promoting the organizational form of mixed work teams in grassroots construction units, according to the trial implementation of some units, can improve the construction efficiency by 20% to 25%. Promoting the experience of using old drawings and standard designs in design can increase the design speed by 30% to 50%. Recently, the Ministry of Construction Engineering has sent responsible cadres to the Northeast, Northwest, Central South and other places to mobilize leading cadres at all levels and help formulate measures to strive to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule. At the same time, the Ministry of Construction Engineering will also hold a meeting of the directors of the Engineering Management Bureau and the managers of the engineering companies to further formulate specific measures to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule.

Liu Xiufeng said: The Ministry of Construction Engineering has a solid foundation for completing the five-year plan ahead of schedule. In the past few years, the technical and professional level of the majority of employees and engineering technicians has been greatly improved, and experience has been accumulated in design and construction. In 1953, some construction units of the Ministry of Construction Engineering needed eight and a half workdays to build each square meter of reinforced concrete factory buildings, but this year it only takes five and a half workdays. In 1953, there was no experience in building modern factories, but now a number of modern factories have been built. Therefore, as long as the majority of employees and engineering technicians give play to their enthusiasm and creativity, strengthen leadership, overcome the conservative thinking of leading cadres at all levels, and actively take effective measures, they will be able to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, December 24th. The Ministry of Coal Industry has taken active measures to strive to complete the five-year coal production plan ahead of schedule. The draft production plan for 1956 recently formulated by the ministry shows that the total output value of various production units next year can reach more than 96% of the 1957 target. The ministry's raw coal output in 1956 will increase by more than 1 million tons compared with the 1956 coal production plan stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan. The Fushun Mining Bureau, which has the largest output, will be able to exceed the level stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan in 1956 due to the estimated further development of potential capacity.

In formulating the 1956 plan, the Ministry of Coal Industry not only first considered meeting the coking coal and general industrial coal needed for the development of industry and transportation, but also considered ensuring the coal supply in technical crop areas as much as possible and appropriately increasing the production of civilian coal in order to adapt to the rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement. The amount of anthracite produced by the ministry in 1956 will be more than 1 million tons more than the amount stipulated by the state to be produced in 1957.

On the basis of overfulfilling the coal production plan year after year, the national state-owned coal mine production units have actively carried out comprehensive production reforms since 1954, and at the same time focused on promoting several Soviet advanced experiences. After the promulgation of the state's first Five-Year Plan, the majority of employees and technicians of the state-owned coal mines launched labor competitions and further developed their enthusiasm and creativity. In this way, there are conditions to guarantee the completion of the coal production plan stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

At present, the various regional administrations under the Ministry of Coal Industry are deeply mobilizing the broad masses of employees and engineering technicians to expose all kinds of conservative thinking that hinders production, overcome backward links in production, and organize forces to earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and actively promote various domestic effective advanced experiences.

    建筑工程部和煤炭工业部   
    积极争取提前完成五年计划
    新华社二十四日讯　建筑工程部部长刘秀峰今天对本社记者说：建筑工程部可以提前完成第一个五年计划的建筑安装任务。根据建筑工程部最近制定的计划，一九五六年的建筑安装工作量比原来的年度承包计划指标提高了百分之二十六以上，比一九五五年实际完成的工作量增加了一倍。目前委托建筑工程部施工的单位正在继续增加一九五六年的工作量。因此，建筑工程部的明年施工工作量还会大大增加。这样建筑工程部就有条件争取提前完成第一个五年的建筑安装计划。
    刘秀峰说：建筑工程部为了保证提前完成五年建筑安装计划，正在拟订各项措施。根据初步拟订的措施计划，建筑工程部计划大力提前设计进度，争取早日出图，把原来计划在明年第二、三季度施工的部分宿舍工程利用一九五五年的旧图提前到第一季度施工，继续进行大规模的冬季施工，以保证全年施工的均衡性和争取做更多的工作量。为了提高劳动生产率，保证工程质量和降低工程成本，明年还将提高工厂化、机械化施工的水平，加强工业管道、卫生技术、机电安装和金属结构安装等专业施工力量，并且要在设计和施工中大量推广先进经验。现在建筑工程部已经开始有计划地训练驾驶施工机械的工人，同时正在筹建二十多个生产企业，包括钢筋混凝土构件预制厂、机械化采石场等，准备在某些城市建立大型的永久性的建筑生产基地。明年计划在施工和设计方面推广的重大先进经验共有几十种。这些先进经验可以使设计和施工的效率大大加快。如在厂房建筑方面推广已经试用成功的苏联先进经验——综合吊装法，可以使工程进度加快百分之三十，并且还能节省百分之三十的劳动力；在基层施工单位推行混合工作队的组织形式，据部分单位试行证明，可以使施工效率提高百分之二十到二十五。在设计中推行采用旧有图纸和标准设计的经验，可以使设计速度提高百分之三十到五十。最近，建筑工程部已派负责干部到东北、西北、中南等地向各级领导干部进行动员，并且帮助拟订措施，争取提前完成五年计划。同时，建筑工程部还要在最近召开工程管理总局局长和工程公司经理会议，进一步制定提前完成五年计划的具体措施。
    刘秀峰说：建筑工程部提前完成五年计划是有可靠基础的。过去几年内，广大职工和工程技术人员的技术业务水平有很大提高，并且在设计和施工中积累了经验。在一九五三年，建筑工程部有些施工单位建筑每平方公尺钢筋混凝土厂房要八个半工日，今年只要五个半工日就行了。一九五三年还没有建筑现代化工厂的经验，现在已经建成了若干现代化的工厂。因此，只要广大职工和工程技术人员发挥积极性、创造性，加强领导，克服各级领导干部的保守思想，积极采取有效措施，就能够提前完成五年计划。
    新华社二十四日讯　煤炭工业部采取积极措施，争取提前完成五年产煤计划。最近这个部制定的一九五六年生产计划草案表明，各生产单位在明年的总产值，可以达到一九五七年指标的百分之九十六以上。这个部一九五六年的原煤产量，将比第一个五年计划规定的一九五六年产煤计划增加一百多万吨。产量最大的抚顺矿务局，由于估计到潜在能力的进一步发挥，一九五六年煤的产量将可超过第一个五年计划规定的水平。
    煤炭工业部在制定一九五六年计划中，不仅首先考虑到满足工业、交通运输业发展所需要的炼焦煤和一般工业用煤，而且为了适应农业合作化运动的迅速发展，考虑到尽量保证技术作物地区的煤炭供应，适当增产民用煤。这个部一九五六年生产的无烟煤，将比国家规定在一九五七年生产的数量还多一百多万吨。
    全国国营煤矿各生产单位，在年年超额完成产煤计划的基础上，从一九五四年起就积极进行了全面生产改革，同时着重推广了几项苏联的先进经验。国家第一个五年计划公布以后，各国营煤矿的广大职工和技术人员，展开劳动竞赛，进一步发挥了积极性和创造性。这样，就有条件能够保证提前完成第一个五年计划规定的产煤计划。
    目前，煤炭工业部所属的各地区管理局，正在深入发动广大职工群众和工程技术人员，揭露各种障碍生产的保守思想，克服生产中的落后环节，并且组织力量认真学习苏联的先进经验，积极推行国内行之有效的各种先进经验。
