Rapidly Eliminate Inferior Glass Quality

Xu Zhuoran, Chief of the Technical Division of the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau, Ministry of Heavy Industry

    Actively improving product quality is a serious task in the current glass industry production. According to statistics, although the production of China's glass industry (referring to flat glass, same below) has increased from 2.068 million boxes (referring to standard boxes, same below) in 1952 to a planned 3.38 million boxes this year, the quality of the glass has consistently failed to meet the planned targets. Taking first-grade products as an example, only 89 percent of the planned target was achieved in 1954, and only 92.24 percent was achieved in the first half of this year. The proportion of first-grade products in the total glass production was 81 percent in 1953, decreased to 74.8 percent in 1954, and only accounted for 75.5 percent in the first half of this year.

    Due to poor product quality, coupled with some shortcomings in sales, the backlog of glass is very serious. By the end of September, the value of glass accumulated by commercial departments and glass factories nationwide was over 26 million yuan. The stock of glass in the Dalian Glass Factory exceeded the inventory quota by more than double, and the inventory of the Shanghai Glass Factory exceeded the quota by more than four times. Due to low product quality and mold and deterioration, the China Export Company stopped purchasing products from the Shanghai Glass Factory in September. As a result, the factory is having problems with product storage and expenses.

    Poor glass quality also has adverse effects on national construction and people's lives. Some of the glass bought by the Beijing Expert Hotel and the Ministry of Higher Education construction site broke when cut with a knife. At present, China does not yet produce polished glass, and high-quality flat glass can be used to produce mirrors. However, poor glass quality has brought many difficulties to artisans who produce mirrors. Some artisans in Xi'an who specialize in plating glass mirrors say: Buying glass at department stores is a gamble because sometimes the glass they buy is deteriorated, and after silver plating, large areas of mold appear, making it unusable. Because the glass surface is uneven, the mirrors distort people's faces, and the workers in the Shanghai mirror industry call these mirrors "funhouse mirrors." Due to poor quality, some of China's exported glass is not only sold at low prices but is also difficult to sell. So far, less than two-thirds of this year's glass export plan has been completed.

    Some people believe that the main reason for the low rate of first-grade glass is that the quality standards for first-grade products are set too high. Are the standards too high? No. The glass quality standards implemented in China over the past few years were formulated with reference to the standards implemented by the Soviet Union in 1941, combined with China's specific situation. They are one grade lower than the Soviet Union's 1941 standards. For example, the standard for first-grade glass produced in China is equivalent to the second-grade product in the Soviet standard. And since January of this year, the Soviet Union has implemented new glass quality standards. According to the new standards, the quality standards of glass currently produced in China are even lower than the Soviet standards. Obviously, China's glass quality standards are not set too high but are too low and must be raised rapidly.

    There are three main reasons for poor glass quality. From the production point of view, the main reason is that workers have not strictly followed the prescribed operating procedures during the melting process of raw materials and when the original glass sheet is made through the drawing mechanism. In modern glass production, transforming raw materials into glass requires accurately proportioning various raw materials, putting the crushed raw materials into a melting furnace with a temperature as high as 1,500 degrees Celsius to melt into a molten liquid, and then using a vertical drawing machine to make the original glass sheet, finally cutting, inspecting, and packaging it for shipment. Each link in this process affects the quality of the glass, especially the melting furnace and drawing processes. If the molten liquid is not melted well, many sand particles, nodules, and air bubbles will appear inside the glass; if the speed and temperature are not suitable in the drawing process, the original glass sheet will also be uneven in thickness and have streaks. Therefore, the melting furnace and drawing processes are critical links in glass production. In 1954, glass factories across the country broke and remelted 401,919 boxes of original glass sheets due to poor production in these two processes, accounting for 10.05 percent of the total drawing volume of glass nationwide last year. Although this glass did not leave the factory, it caused a great loss to national wealth. Its value totaled more than 5.2 million yuan, which is roughly equivalent to more than one and a half years of production for the Shanghai Glass Factory. The situation is even more serious this year. In the first half of this year, more than 380,000 boxes of original glass sheets were scrapped nationwide due to poor production in these two processes, with a value of more than 4.99 million yuan.

    Poor glass quality is also due to the failure to do a good job in promoting advanced experience and new technologies. Although we have promoted some advanced technologies in the past, some important new technologies, such as the advanced experience of the Soviet felt-type charging machine (which can increase the contact surface of raw materials in the melting furnace, strengthen melting, and thereby improve glass quality), have not yet been implemented. Some advanced experiences have been promoted, but they are not thorough enough to exert their due effect. The advanced experience of non-grooved drawing (which can guarantee quality) is one example. It was originally decided to promote this advanced experience in the Shanghai Glass Factory in April, but it has not yielded results so far and has been stalled. In China's glass manufacturing plants, only the Shanghai Glass Factory has some automatic temperature control instruments to date, but they have never been used. Other factories, although they have automatic control instruments for pressure, temperature, waste gas analysis, gas flow, and glass liquid level, have not used them either. This means that they have to use eyesight and some backward methods to control the operation, and sometimes the temperature difference is as much as 20 to 30 degrees. This makes it difficult to guarantee product quality.

    Poor packaging and storage cause glass to become moldy and deteriorate. In order to avoid glass sheets from breaking and becoming moldy in the boxes, the state has stipulated that the humidity of the wood used for wooden boxes should not exceed 25 percent, and the humidity of the straw used for padding between the glass sheets should not exceed 13 percent. However, the glass factories have not implemented this regulation well. Some factories have not established a system for inspecting the humidity of wood and straw, and often use wood to make boxes when it is still very wet in order to be quick. In terms of straw use, many factories take it from the straw pile and dry it only when they urgently need to use it. The Qinhuangdao Glass Factory even put a lot of straw with mud roots into the boxes. The factories also do not pay enough attention to the storage of glass. The Shenyang Glass Factory used to use a very small open shed to store glass. The shed was too small, and there was too much glass, so a large part of the glass was stored in the open air, which increased the humidity of the glass and caused it to become moldy and deteriorate. The above facts show that the reasons for poor glass quality are mainly subjective.

    Regarding the phenomenon of poor glass product quality, the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry sent people to various factories for inspection three times in July, October 1954, and April of this year. Due to their low technical and professional level, they did not give the factories the help they should have. Until now, this issue has not attracted the attention it deserves from the leading staff and workers of the factories. Some leading staff members in some factories still intentionally or unintentionally set guaranteeing product quantity and quality against each other, and lack confidence in improving glass quality. At the meeting of deputy factory directors (i.e., chief engineers) of glass factories convened by the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in late July this year, the leaders proposed that China's current quality standards should be raised by one grade, i.e., raised to the level of the Soviet Union's 1941 glass quality standards, and should be implemented starting from the fourth quarter of this year, but the leaders of the Qinhuangdao, Shenyang, Dalian, and other glass factories all said that it could not be done.

    Now, in addition to the Ministry of Heavy Industry and its subordinate Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau having sent another working group to various places in October to conduct inspections and provide assistance, and will take a series of measures to eliminate the phenomenon of poor glass quality, each glass factory should also attach importance to this issue ideologically and start to improve from the following aspects:

    First, conscientiously study and implement the various documents and instructions issued by the leading authorities regarding technical management, improve and enrich the organization and business of the chief engineer system, strengthen the laboratory and chief mechanical (equipment) engineer institutions, and effectively strengthen the ex ante control work from raw materials to finished products; improve technical operations, and effectively carry out equipment maintenance to ensure the safety and rational use of melting furnaces. Eliminate various chaotic phenomena, give full play to the due role of various organizational institutions, and establish a normal production order in the enterprise.

    Second, strictly implement the production storage system and related technical operation systems stipulated by the leading authorities, and organize and promote new technologies and advanced experiences in a purposeful and planned manner. Workers who perform well in implementing the system, operating procedures, and promoting new technologies and advanced experiences should be rewarded.

    Third, regularly and universally conduct in-depth education for the vast number of employees and technical personnel to improve product quality, so that they can recognize the harm of poor product quality to national construction and people's lives, mobilize them to put forward suggestions for improving product quality and completing the national plan, strive to improve their technical level, and rely on their enthusiasm and wisdom to eliminate the current phenomenon of poor glass quality.

    Fourth, appropriately add some necessary instruments and equipment, such as various automatic control instruments, to strengthen scientific technical operations, stabilize the thermal system of the melting furnace, improve quality, and reduce waste products. In order to prevent mold and deterioration and reduce the humidity of wood and straw, factories without or lacking drying equipment can also appropriately add some equipment related to these aspects.

    In short, the struggle to improve product quality is a major task for the employees in the glass industry. Each glass factory should bravely take on this task and quickly eliminate the current phenomenon of poor glass quality!

    迅速消除玻璃质量低劣的现象
    重工业部建筑材料工业管理局技术处处长  徐卓然
    积极地提高产品质量是目前玻璃工业生产中的一项严重任务。根据统计，几年来，我国玻璃工业的生产（指平板玻璃，下同）虽然已经由一九五二年的二百零六万八千箱（指标准箱，下同）增加到了今年计划的三百三十八万箱，但是从玻璃的质量方面来看，一直未能完成计划。以一级品为例，一九五四年只完成计划指标的百分之八十九，今年上半年也只达到百分之九十二点二四。一级品在玻璃总产量中所占的比重，一九五三年为百分之八十一，一九五四年下降为百分之七十四点八，今年上半年也仅占百分之七十五点五。
    由于产品质量不好，加上推销工作有某些缺点，玻璃积压的情况十分严重。到九月底止，全国商业部门和各玻璃厂积压的玻璃共值两千六百多万元。大连玻璃厂积存的玻璃超过了库存定额的一倍多，上海玻璃厂的库存超过了定额的四倍多。由于产品质量低和发霉变质，中国出口公司已经在九月间停止收购上海玻璃厂的产品。结果，这个厂的产品存放和开支都成问题了。
    玻璃质量不好，还给国家建设和人民生活带来不良的影响。北京专家招待所和高等教育部工地买的玻璃，有的用刀一切就碎了。目前我国还没有生产磨光玻璃，利用质地优良的平板玻璃来生产镜子也是可以的。但是，由于玻璃质量不好，给制镜生产的手工业者带来了很多困难。西安市有些专营镀光玻璃镜子的手工业者说：在百货公司买玻璃是碰运气。因为他们有时候买回来的玻璃变质了，镀银以后便呈现大片霉块，不能使用。由于玻璃面凸凹不平，制成镜子以后把人照得面目全非，上海市制镜业的工人们就把这种镜叫作“哈哈镜”。由于质量不好，我国出口的某些玻璃不仅售价低，还不易销售。到现在，今年玻璃出口的计划还没有完成三分之二。
    有人认为玻璃一级品率低的主要原因，是一级品的质量标准订得过高了。是不是标准过高了呢？不是的。我国几年来所实行的玻璃质量标准，是参照苏联一九四一年所实行的标准，结合我国情况制定的，它比苏联一九四一年的标准低一级，如我国生产的一级品玻璃标准，等于苏联标准中的二级品。而苏联从今年一月开始，又实行了新的玻璃质量标准，按照新标准，我国现在所生产的玻璃质量标准，更加低于苏联的标准了。显然，我国的玻璃质量标准不是订得太高了，而是太低了，必须迅速加以提高。
    玻璃质量不好的主要原因有三。从生产方面来看，主要是原料在熔化过程中和经过引上机制成原板玻璃的时候，工人们没有严格执行规定的操作手续。在现代化的玻璃生产中，从原料变成玻璃，需要准确地配备各种原料，把经过粉碎的原料投入温度高达摄氏一千五百度的熔窑内去熔化成熔液，然后再利用直拉式引上机来制成玻璃原板，最后切裁检验，包装出厂。其中的每一环节，都会对玻璃质量发生影响，特别是在熔窑和引上这两个工序上。如果熔液熔化得不好，玻璃的内部就会出现许多砂粒和疙疸、气泡等；如果在引上工序中速度和温度不合适，玻璃原板也就会出现厚薄不均和发生线道等现象。所以，熔窑及引上两个工序是玻璃生产中带有关键性的环节。一九五四年，全国玻璃厂因为这两个工序的生产不好而把玻璃原板摔碎，重新回炉熔化的，即达四十万一千九百一十九箱，占去年全国玻璃总引上量的百分之十点零五。这些玻璃虽然都未出厂，但是对国家资财的损失是很大的。它的价值合计达五百二十多万元，即约相当于上海玻璃厂一年半的生产量还多。今年的情况更严重，今年上半年，全国玻璃厂因这两个工序的生产不好而报废的玻璃原板共达三十八万多箱，价值达四百九十九万多元。
    玻璃质量不好，还由于没有做好推广先进经验和新技术工作。过去我们虽然推广了一些先进技术，但是，有些重要的新技术，如苏联毡式加料机的先进经验，（可使原料在熔窖内增加热的接触面，加强熔化，从而获得提高玻璃质量的效果）至今还没推行。有些先进经验虽然已经推行，但是很不彻底，不能发挥应有的效果。无槽引上先进经验（可以保证质量）就是一例。本来决定四月份在上海玻璃厂推行这一先进经验，至今没有获得结果，已经停顿起来了。在我国玻璃制造厂中，到现在为止只有上海玻璃厂有一些自动控制温度仪器，但是一直没有动用过。其他厂虽然有自动控制压力、温度、废气分析、煤气流量及玻璃液面的自动控制仪表，也都没有使用。这样就不得不用肉眼和一些落后的办法来控制操作，有时温度上下相差二三十度之多。这当然很难保证产品质量了。
    包装、保管不善，使玻璃发霉变质。为了避免玻璃片在箱内彼此碰碎和发霉变质，国家曾规定，用作木箱的木板的湿度不得超过百分之二十五，用来夹垫在玻璃间稻草的湿度不得超过百分之十三。但是，对于这个规定，各玻璃厂都没很好执行。有的工厂没建立检验木板和稻草湿度的制度，常常为了图快，在木板还很湿的时候就用来做箱子。在稻草使用方面，许多工厂都是在急需使用的时候才从稻草堆上拿下来晒一晒。秦皇岛玻璃厂甚至把许多带着泥根的稻草也装入箱内。各厂对玻璃的保管注意得也不够。沈阳玻璃厂过去用一个很小的敞棚来存放玻璃。敞棚太小，玻璃太多，所以很大一部分玻璃都露天堆垛存放，致使玻璃湿度加大，发霉变质。以上事实说明，造成玻璃质量不好的原因，主要是主观方面的。
    对于玻璃产品质量低劣的现象，重工业部建筑材料工业管理局曾于一九五四年七月、十月和今年四月间，三次派人到各厂进行检查，由于技术水平和业务水平不高，没有给各个工厂以应有的帮助。直到现在，这个问题还没引起各厂领导工作人员和工人应有的注意。有些厂的领导工作人员仍有意或无意地把保证产品数量和质量对立起来，对提高玻璃质量缺乏信心。今年七月下旬，重工业部建筑材料工业管理局召开玻璃厂生产副厂长（即总工程师）会议的时候，领导方面曾提出应该把我国现行的质量标准提高一级，即提高到苏联一九四一年玻璃质量标准的水平上，并且从今年第四季度就开始实行，但是秦皇岛、沈阳、大连等玻璃厂的领导人员都表示办不到。
    现在，除了重工业部和所属的建筑材料工业管理局已经在十月间再派出工作组到各地进行检查和帮助，并且将采取一系列的措施来消除玻璃质量低劣的现象外，各玻璃厂也应该从思想上重视这个问题，并且从以下几个方面着手改进： 
    第一，认真地钻研并且贯彻执行领导机关所发布的有关技术管理方面的各种文件和指示，健全和充实总工程师系统的组织和业务，增强化验室和总机械（设备）师机构，切实加强从原料到成品的事先控制工作；改善技术操作，有效地进行设备维护工作，以保证熔窑安全和合理使用。消除各种混乱现象，充分发挥各个组织机构的应有作用，建立起企业中的正常生产秩序。
    第二，严格执行领导机关规定的生产保管制度和有关技术操作的制度，有目的有计划地组织和推广新技术和先进经验。对在执行制度、操作规程和推广新技术和先进经验中表现良好的工作者，应该给予奖励。
    第三，经常而又普遍深入地对广大职工和技术人员进行提高产品质量的教育，使他们认识到产品质量不好对国家建设和人民生活的危害，发动他们提出改进产品质量和完成国家计划的建议，努力提高技术水平，依靠他们的积极性和智慧，来消除目前玻璃质量低劣的现象。
    第四，适当地增添一些必要的仪器设备，例如各种自动的控制仪表等，以加强科学的技术操作，稳定熔窑的热工制度，提高质量，减少废品。为了防止发霉变质，降低木板和稻草的湿度，在没有或缺少烘干设备的工厂，也可以适当增添一些有关这些方面的设备。
    总之，为提高产品质量而斗争，这是目前玻璃工业中职工们一项重大的任务。各玻璃厂应该勇敢地把这一任务担当起来，迅速消除目前玻璃质量低劣的现象！
