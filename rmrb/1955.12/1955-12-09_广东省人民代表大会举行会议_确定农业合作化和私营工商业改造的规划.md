The Guangdong Provincial People's Congress Holds Meeting
Determines Plans for Agricultural Cooperativization and Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce

    The Third Session of the First Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, held from November 27th to December 2nd, determined that Guangdong Province should basically achieve semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization by the end of 1956, and basically bring capitalist industry and commerce into the advanced form of state capitalism—joint state-private ownership—by the end of 1957.

    The meeting considered that in order to complete and overfulfill Guangdong Province's First Local Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to focus on developing agricultural producers' cooperatives as the central link. The meeting determined that the province's agricultural producers' cooperatives should develop to 150,000 by the end of 1956, and the number of farmers joining the cooperatives should reach 80% of the province's total number of farmers. This winter and next spring, 100,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives should be developed according to the plan, and it is necessary to ensure that these agricultural producers' cooperatives have a high quality.

    In order to adapt to the development of the nation's socialist economic construction, the meeting considered it necessary to accelerate the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, requiring that the task of transforming capitalist industry and commerce into joint state-private ownership be basically completed by the end of 1957. The meeting also specifically stipulated some steps and measures to complete this task.

    Guangdong Province's First Local Five-Year Plan stipulates that grain production in 1957 should increase by 7 billion jin compared to 1952. The meeting believed that although Guangdong Province suffered from serious natural disasters this year, as long as we seize the opportunity to expand the replanting area, improve the cultivation system, reclaim wasteland, repair water conservancy projects, and fully supply agricultural tools and draught cattle and other production increase measures on the basis of cooperativization, we can not only guarantee the completion of the task of increasing grain production by 7 billion jin, but also overfulfill the task by increasing grain production by 1 billion jin.

    广东省人民代表大会举行会议
    确定农业合作化和私营工商业改造的规划
    十一月二十七日到十二月二日举行的广东省第一届人民代表大会第三次会议确定：广东省要在一九五六年年底以前基本上实现半社会主义的农业合作化，一九五七年年底以前基本上把资本主义工商业纳入国家资本主义的高级形式——公私合营的轨道。
    会议认为：为了完成和超额完成广东省的第一个地方五年计划，必须抓紧发展农业生产合作社这一中心环节。会议确定全省农业生产合作社在一九五六年年底以前要发展到十五万个，入社农户要达到全省农户总数的百分之八十。今冬明春要按计划发展到十万个农业生产合作社，并且要保证这些农业生产合作社都有较高的质量。
    为了适应国家的社会主义经济建设发展的形势，会议认为必须加紧对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，要求在一九五七年年底以前基本上完成对资本主义工商业实行公私合营的改造任务。会议还具体规定了完成这个任务的一些步骤和措施。
    广东省第一个地方五年计划规定一九五七年的粮食产量要比一九五二年增加七十亿斤。会议认为，广东省今年虽然受到了严重的自然灾害，但是只要在合作化的基础上抓紧扩大复种面积、改良耕作制度、开垦荒地、修好水利、充分地供应农具和耕牛等增产措施，不仅可以保证完成增产七十亿斤粮食的任务，而且可以超额增产十亿斤粮食。              （新华社）
